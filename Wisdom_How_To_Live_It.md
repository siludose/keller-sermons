Welcome to the Gospel Unliked Podcast. Many of the questions we face in life are complex and aren't always answered by simply  following rules. Do I speak up now or do I wait? Should I take that job or say where I am? That's why wisdom is so crucial.

But how do we develop it? Today join us as Tim Keller explores how we apply God's wisdom to the everyday complexities  of our lives.

The scripture this morning is from Proverbs chapter 4 verses 5 to 9 and verses 14 to 27. Get wisdom. Get understanding. Do not forget my words or turn away from them. Do not forsake wisdom and she will protect you, love her and she will watch over you.

The beginning of wisdom is this. Get wisdom, though it costs you all you have, get understanding, cherish her and she will  exalt you, embrace her and she will honor you. She will give you a garland to grace your head and present you with a glorious crown. Do not set foot on the path of the wicked or walk in the way of the evil doers, avoid it,  do not travel on it, turn from it and go on your way. For they cannot rest until they do evil.

They are robbed of sleep till they make someone stumble. They eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of vows. The path of the righteous is like the morning sun shining ever brighter till the full  light of day. But the way of the wicked is like deep darkness. They do not know what makes them stumble.

My son, pay attention to what I say, turn your ears to my words. Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart. For they are life to those who find them and health to one's whole body. Above or else, guard your heart. For everything you do flows from it.

Keep your mouth from perversity. Keep corrupt talk far from your lips. Put your eyes look straight ahead, fix your gaze directly before you. Give careful thought to the paths for your feet and be steadfast in all your ways. Do not turn to the right or the left.

Keep your foot from evil. The word of the Lord. We live in a culture of choice. Now I know that often is an advertisement, it's a slogan, but it's really true. Most places and most times in history, you didn't choose who you married.

It's a fairly recent idea that you decided instead of your parents. But of course, that's just the beginning. We are free to be who we want to be, live as we want to live. Do the things we want to do because our culture is the most individualistic culture in the  history of the world, and therefore our place and our parents and our social location  do not determine so much what we can do. We have choices, choices, and what does that mean?

That means that we've never needed wisdom more than we do now because wisdom is the ability  to make wise choices. It's not enough just to be good and decent. Here's two careers you could choose. They're both morally permissible. Neither is sinful.

Neither of them is wrong about either of them. But if you choose unwisely, if you choose the wrong one, one that doesn't fit you, you  could lose years of your life, actually, it could be a disaster. We've never needed wisdom more than we do now. What we've been doing for three weeks, and this is the last of the three, we've been looking  at the early chapters of the book of Proverbs in the Bible. We're looking at the themes of the book of Proverbs.

We've been looking at what wisdom is. It's competence with regard to the complex realities of life. We've been looking at how you develop wisdom. Today we're looking at this famous passage where we learn three things that characterize  a wise life. If you want to lead a life of wisdom, that life will be characterized by three things.

A glorious fight, a guarded heart, a living word. Let's take a look. First of all, the way of wisdom is the way of our life of wisdom is basically, it could  be characterized as a glorious fight. This is five to nine I'm thinking of. Get wisdom, get understanding.

Do not forsake wisdom, though it cost you all you have, get understanding, cherish her,  embrace her, and she will give you a garland to grace your head and present you with a glorious  crown. The words all through there are various words that get across diligent exertion and determination  of will. The word get that comes up four times is actually the word that means purchase and it means  a costly purchase, so it's the language of sacrifice and besides that it says right there in  verse seven, it will cost you all you have, get wisdom. Do not forsake in verse six literally means don't let go of be dogged, relentlessness. So there's sacrifice, there's relentlessness.

Notice that there's a language here, it's a metaphor of pursuing a woman to marry. It says don't forsake her, love her, cherish her, embrace her, and she will respond and she  will honor you, so that's the language of passion and pursuit. So all through here, we're talking about determination of will, something that you actually  have to fight in order to keep at the very center of your life, but it's a glorious fight  because as it says, it ends with a glorious crown, some of the other verses which we won't  take the time to look at, tell you about that, gradually, gradually, see verse 18 and 19,  the path of the righteous is like the morning sun shining ever brighter until the full light  of day, the way the wicked is deep darkness, they do not know what makes them stumble. The contrast, the reason why wisdom is worth it is because as time goes on, a wise person  gets more peace, not restlessness as the verses talk about, more clarity, the understand  things that you never understood, not more and more darkness as it were, and things are  going wrong, you're stumbling, you don't even know why you're just getting more angry. Oh, my wisdom is like a glorious credit, it's worth the fight, but why is it such a fight?

Why is it such a fight? Why does it take such diligence? Why does it say, get wisdom, they'll cost you all you have, clear it, why does it take  such determination of will? Now, here we can, whether you were here the last two weeks or not, it's just as well  that we recap a bit because it's good for us. And that means the answer to that question, why is it so much fight is because first of  all, we're naturally fools, we're not blank slates that we need to fill up with foolishness  or with wisdom, we come as fools and therefore we're fighting our own nature.

And secondly, because the basic things that are being told to, excuse me, excuse me,  sir, the blinking of the camera is very, very distracting, forgive me, and I don't mean  to embarrass anybody, and I've never done that in my whole life before, but it's been  very hard. So I'm glad you're here, it's just, you know, years ago my wife would say, I would have  been a fool and not even said anything, but I'm wiser today, I'm just, I found a way  to make it okay, and you're okay and I'm okay, but okay, all right, here's two reasons. We just, if you were here two weeks ago, look, you have a temperament, right, having you  taken temperament inventories that Myers-Briggs, some are introverts, some are extroverts,  some are intuitive, some are more analytical, some of us like closure, some of us like process. Do you remember we talked about a study that across three dozen, three dozen different cultures,  we realized that there's three basic ways that were neurologically wired in order to  deal with problems, some of us retreat, instinctively, some of us attack instinctively, some  of us stand pat and wait, and if you remember what the psychologist said about all these temperaments  is that since we habitually, you know, those of us are introverts, extroverts, rational  intuitive closure process, you know, attack, hold back, we instinctively respond to situations,  the way we're wired or the way we've been raised or the way our culture has taught us,  and only a small fraction of the situations in which we find ourselves, is that natural  approach, the right one. If you attack, when you should be retreating, if you retreat, when you should be attacking,  if you stand and wait and see, when you should be acting, you can die.

And all of us are wired to instinctively act in a certain way in certain situations,  which means we have temperaments, you say, what's wrong with the temperament, everybody's  got a temperament, yeah, that's why we're all fools. Because the world doesn't have a temperament, you see, the world doesn't, if the world  was perfectly fitted to your temperament, so the introverted approach or the extroverted  approach, the speak out or the wait and listen, the come to closure or the, let's let  it go into process. If the world had a temperament and you perfectly fitted, you'd be perfectly wise with none  of us, none of us are. And therefore we're all naturally fools, and to become a wise person means that you have  to be so in touch with reality that you know how to get out beyond, you have a range  of responses that goes beyond your inborn, your culture, your psychology, your neurology,  and you know how to go against those and always act in a way that's wise. Very, very difficult.

That's why it's always a fight to be wise. You're always having to fight against the normal way you do things, but as time goes on,  if you're becoming wise, you realize, look, I hate doing it that way, I never don't like  doing it that way, but this situation calls for it, so I'm going to do it. The other reason why it's a fight is because as we saw when you looked at the book of  Proverbs, Proverbs chapter 3, the things that the Bible says are, the things that develop  wisdom are processes, and they are disciplines that you have to stay at for years and years  and years. That's the reason why wisdom actually is always a gradual thing. The path of the righteous is like the morning sun shining ever brighter and brighter to  the full way today.

Remember, one of the things the Bible says is in chapter 3 that is the root of wisdom  is the fear of the Lord. Now you hear that and you say, what is that? What we said, the fear of the Lord means to have a vital, existential relationship with  God, not just believing in Him, but a vibrant, vital relationship in which His love and  His holiness is real to you, which means a prayer life. And anybody who even just says, I'm going to pray for 30 minutes a day, you know how hard  that is. It's unbelievably hard just to keep your mind on it.

We said another thing that brings wisdom is accountability. Is having people, a fool is wise in his own eyes, so the definition of a fool is someone  who only cares what he or she thinks. That's a fool. And wise in my own eyes, my eyes, there's all that matter. I see it.

That's the way it is. Wisdom always is trying to see the thing through other people's eyes. And so the wise person has got a company of counselors and a company of advisors and  friends who are, they're all, they're never making, a wise person never makes decisions  unilaterally, but always comes and gets a lot of advice and takes it, you have to be  accountable. Do you have anybody, for example, do you have four or five people or somebody who looks  at how you spend your money? You say, well that's private, no, okay, that's also foolish.

If you get nobody else's perspective, of course you're going to be, you're going to have  all kinds of self-justifications. You might be very unwise in the way you spend your money. You'd be more wise if you were actually spending your money accountable to other people  that you trust in community. That's hard. One last thing, as we've said, I didn't tell the story on this side of the park's hotel  tea now, is you've all heard that you become wise by immersing yourself in the word  of God.

I think most of us say, and when you read the Bible, that takes, it makes you wise. Now, it takes years and years and years. I mean, after all these years of having to probably, I probably had a teacher preach on  the Bible about two or three thousand times in my life. I'm sometimes, I don't mean to discourage it, it's just starting to feel like I'm starting  to get it. In other words, passages that didn't use to make sense, start to make sense because you've  seen enough other passages, but here's the thing, it's not just the details of the Bible.

It's not just all, you know, I found a verse that says this, I didn't know I was supposed  to do that. That doesn't happen that often anymore to me, but here's what you do have to constantly  do. Alistair McIntyre, Catholic Theologian, a Catholic philosopher, tells a story in his book  After Virtue, it gives an illustration, it's a lot of fun. The illustration is, imagine you are standing at a bus stop and a man who you've never met  in your life before comes up, never met him, and he says, hey, do you know that the Latin  name for the common wild duck is histrionic, is histrionic, is histrionic, and then he walks  away. Okay, so how do you make sense of that?

It must be some reason, how do you make sense of it? And McIntyre says the only way to make sense of it is you have to put it into a story. Now it could be a sad story, and you say, maybe he's mentally ill, and that would be a sad  story, but that would make sense of it, right? It makes sense of it, yes. The other possibility is a little more of a funny story, and that is that it's mistaken  identity.

He was at a library the other day, and he was asking a librarian for a book on wild ducks,  he got the book, and he sees you at the bus stop, and you look like the librarian, you  know, your hair or your lack of hair or whatever, look, you just, it reminds you, so he thinks  you're the librarian. That's a funny story. That would make sense of it. McIntyre brings up one more possibility. He says, maybe the guy is a secret agent, and he mistakes you for his contact.

And he's giving you the code words. Now that's outlandish, but it's possible. And what he says is, unless you understand what happened in the light of a story, you  don't know how to respond. Now this world tells you that, well, this culture will tell you this, there might be  a God or might not. Nobody can know, that's what they'll tell you.

And there might be an afterlife or not, but nobody can tell you that, either. So this life is the place where you have to, if you're going to have any happen, you  have to have it right now. That's the story of the world. The Bible tells you a different story, that God created the world, and therefore you,  and therefore everything you have as a gift. And he's going to renew the world, and if you believe in him, you're going to live in  that world forever and ever, which means this life is like the vestibule to a mansion.

Your entire life here is just the tiniest little beginning of it. Which story are you going to believe? Depending on which story you believe, and depending to the degree to which that you really  take that into your heart, it affects everything. How do you spend your money? How much money do you give away?

If you put it in that story, your behavior with your money is going to be utterly different  than if you put your money in this story over here, the Bible story. And therefore, it's not just reading the Bible to get the principles and the rules out  of it, though there's lots of great principles and rules. You have to read every part of the Bible, you have to read the narratives and the poetry  and the history and everything. And more and more you do that, the more you become conversant with the Bible, the wiser  you get, the more it affects everything you do. Even where the Bible doesn't speak is directly to say, here's how much money you have to give  away exactly.

It doesn't say that. And yet, it has an immense impact on the way in which you do how you spend your money daily  depending on the story. It's a fight to be wise. It takes years and years and years, but it's a glorious fight. Second thing, a wise life is not just characterized by a glorious fight, but by a guarded heart.

What do we mean by a guarded heart? That's the second thing. Before it considering that the book of Proverbs is all about Proverbs is all about wisdom  and getting wisdom, verse 23 is pretty amazing because essentially it's saying, and there's  nothing more important than this if you're going to be wise. Above all else, verse 23, guard your heart for everything you do flows from it. Now that is not the modern understanding of the heart.

We believe the heart is the seed of the emotions. We think that the thoughts come from the head and the emotions come from the heart. Now we live in a day in time in which the emotions are privileged. We have lots and lots of science fiction. One of the meta narratives of all the Star Trek movies and television series is that machines  have reason.

You know, robots and computers have reason, but we only, we have emotions, and that's  what makes us human. What makes us human is not reason, but it's emotion. That's what makes us not a machine, but a human being. It's interesting that Greeks and the Romans saw exactly the opposite. They said the thing that makes us humans and not animals is that we have reason, but  that's another sermon.

Another story. But the point is actually, well, it's not totally different. Another story. Greeks and Romans and modern people have always pitted the emotions versus the reason. Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer?

Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith? For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding  of what it means to follow Christ. A great resource to start using this summer is the new city catechism devotional, God's  truth for our hearts and minds. This devotional brings the historic catechisms of the Christian Church to life, offering  a question to consider for each week of the year. In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catechesis, the rich and communal  practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers that frame the foundational beliefs  of the Christian faith.

Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer, and a brief meditation that will challenge  and inspire you. The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller,  and Kevin De Young, as well as historical figures such as Augustine, John Calvin, and  Martin Luther. This month, in addition to the new city catechism devotional, we are including a great companion  resource, the new city catechism for kids, as our thank you for your gift to help gospel  and life share the hope of Christ's love with people all over the world. So request your copies today at gospelonlife.com slash give, that's gospelonlife.com slash give. Now here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching.

You think these things, you feel these things, and we live today in a time in which we  say, well, owning your feelings and expressing your feelings and making them work for you  and being true to your feelings, that's what means it means to be an authentic well-integrated  human being. Two weeks ago, there was an article in the New York Times magazine called, Can emotional  intelligence be taught in schools? And today, we don't have that concept of wisdom that the Bible has in our culture, but  we do have the concept of emotional intelligence, which is almost the closest thing we've got. Emotional intelligence, according to that article, is more predictive of success in life  than academic achievement. And emotional intelligence, by that, they mean the ability to know your own emotions and  then manage them.

So it's all about managing your emotions, reframing them to make sure that they don't  run away with you, but owning up to them, and that's considered wisdom. Now, I have to say, if you read the Book of Proverbs, you understand why studies are showing  that people who can control their emotions and understand their emotions have better  life outcomes than people who can't, because that's part of wisdom in the Book of Proverbs. But it's not the most important part, because believe it or not, when you're dealing with  people's emotions and when you think, oh, I've gotten down to their emotions, now they're  getting down to their feelings, now I've gotten down to the bedrock of who they are. According to the Bible, no, you haven't. Because look what it says here, and then look at the verses afterwards.

It says, guard your heart for everything flows from it. You go through the rest of the book of the Bible, and even just the Proverbs. You'll see often it talks about thinking with the heart, or acting with the heart, not  just feeling with the heart. This does not say, the heart is the seed of the emotion, the emotions flow from the heart,  but the brain has a reason to think what it says. Everything flows from the heart.

And afterwards it actually says, what your mouth says, what your eyes perceive, and what  your body does, is all flowing from the heart. Why? Because the Bible believes that the heart is actually the seed of your most fundamental commitments,  your most fundamental hopes and trusts. It is the things, let me say this carefully, I'll try to say twice, just so it sinks in. It is where you hold the beliefs about the things you think you must have in order  to receive life joyfully.

Everybody believes there's some things we must have to receive life joyfully. If I have that, then I can be joyful. Then my life has meaning, then I'm secure, then I know I'm worth something. Everybody has a set of beliefs of things, if I have that, then I can receive life joyfully. And what your heart chooses to believe affects everything else.

What the heart chooses, the mind perceives and finds reasonable, the emotions desire and  find beautiful. The will does and finds practical. So what your heart believes, you must have in order to receive life joyfully, what your  heart most rests in, trusts in, hopes in, that is what sets your mind, your will and  your emotions, what you perceive, what you feel about what you perceive, and what you  do about what you perceive. Because from the heart comes everything, now unless you get down to that level, you want  to understand yourself. And I remember some years ago, two men, young men, both engaged and in both cases, their  fiancees broke it off.

Both cases, the women broke off the engagement. I was passionately involved with both of them, and they didn't know each other. They were separate couples. And they were both pretty devastated by, of course. And they were both pretty angry, angry feelings of anger toward the women.

One man, however, did forgive, it was hard, hard work, forgave. The woman who broke up with him and moved on and dated other women and eventually found  a woman and married her and had a wonderful, wonderful marriage that a man couldn't get  past it, not at all, stayed bitter, and it poisoned all the other relationships he ever had. Because he couldn't forgive that woman who had done that to him, he didn't trust women. In other words, it flowed out. And so he didn't trust women.

He assumed they all were this way or that way, and so he was suspicious of him, and therefore  he was extremely unwise in the way which he related to them. And relationship after relationship blew up, and he blames it on women, it was actually  him. A little bit like somebody who says, he got drunk on vodka and soda water on Tuesday night,  he got drunk on bourbon and soda water Wednesday night, he got drunk on tequila and soda water. Do you do that Thursday night? And he says, so what is it that got him drunk every night, obviously, the soda water?

Why couldn't he get it through it? And you know why? Oh, he couldn't control his feelings, oh yes, emotional intelligence, you have to reframe  things, you have to realize, you have to count to 10, you have to think, well, maybe the  woman was this and that, no, no, no, no, no, they were both very beautiful women. In both cases, really, really beautiful women, physically beautiful. And they broke up.

The guy who forgave and moved on and got another woman and got married, she wasn't anywhere  near as physically beautiful, but it wasn't so important to him, but it was extraordinarily  important to the other guy. Because down deep in his heart, he said, here's how I know I'm really somebody, and that  is I got a beautiful wife. A wife that other guys are jealous of, see. There's a whole lot of reasons why if you make, if you do that, it's would have been  a bad marriage anyway, but I'll tell you. The fact of the matter was, he couldn't receive life joyfully unless he had a really,  you know, a woman who is just absolutely gorgeous, that everybody would be jealous of.

And he just didn't see anything wrong with that, he lost his heart, he didn't guard his  heart, he didn't lose his heart to her. He lost his heart to something that he had actually given it to, a kind of savior,  a kind of, this is what's going to make your life okay. If you know anything about the life of Jacob in the book of Genesis, it's kind of what  he did with Rachel. If somebody, if a woman like that was willing to marry me, boy, then that would heal  all the rest of my nasty life. See, unless you're willing to get down to your beliefs, your commitments, your hopes,  your trust, you're not going to have any ability to handle your emotions, so guard your  heart.

That leaves us to the last issue, how do you do that? See, it's not, it's not now a matter of what are in the world are you, what does guard  your heart mean? See, when you first read that, you probably think, be careful about your emotions. Oh, it's a lot more, it's not more difficult than that. There are ways to manage your emotions, you can just stuff your emotions, you can learn  breathing techniques, you can, you know, you could read the New York Times article, there's  talk about reframing.

You know, it was a little boy named Anthony, he's nine years old, and he did something  in school, and all the kids laughed at him, and he was furious, and he started fighting,  so they brought him into a emotional intelligence session. It's in the article, and they sat down, they tried to help him to both control his anger,  when he starts to get angry, he tells himself things, and reframe it. What does it mean, reframe? Is it, well, the teacher said, are you sure that the kids were laughing at you because they  thought you were stupid and mean, are you sure they just weren't nervous? And they didn't know what to say, so they were just being awkward.

So he thought about it, and he said, well, I think you're probably right about some  of them, but some of them really, you know, meant, you know, some of them were just laughing  at me, but you see, the teacher couldn't go down any deeper and say, well, okay, so  now, let's talk about, you know, what in the world are you, so what, if the kids laughed  at you, you see, the teacher had to try to make them say, the children weren't really  being mean to you, they were just being awkward, but he kept insisting, no, they were being  mean, and then the teacher didn't know where to go. Now you have, listen, there is something a lot deeper according to the Bible than just  controlling your emotions, it's guarding your heart, how are you going to do that? Well, the answer is actually right here in verse 20, 21 and 22, it tells you the teacher  of the Torah. Now the person who is addressing the young man or young man is reading the book of Proverbs,  all through the book of Proverbs, keeps talking about, I'm going to give you my words, and  you need to guard my words, and you need to take my words. What are those words?

Are the words of the teacher of the Torah, which is the law of God? It's the scripture. And the book of Proverbs, in fact, all the wisdom literature is basically taking the law of  God, the great principles of the law of God, and bringing them down to earth into daily  life, applying the law of God, the great principles and precepts of the law of God into daily  life. And so what he says is this, listen carefully, my son, pay attention to what I say, turn  your ear to my words, do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart,  for they are life to those who find them and health to one's whole body. They are life to those who find them and health to one's whole body.

Now that's interesting, because you want to guard your heart, he says, take my words. Now these aren't just a person's words, these are the words of the Torah. Take the words of the Bible as it were, that I'm going to teach you, and put them into  your heart. And you see how strong the claim is here? He doesn't just simply say, live by them.

He says, the words I give you are life. You put them in your heart, and that's going to guard your heart now, at one level that  makes perfect sense, because how do you come to your beliefs, by the way? How do you decide if a really beautiful woman loves me, then I'll be okay? How did that happen? How do you decide if this or that happens, then if I have money, if I have wealth, if  my career goes well, you know, two people walk side by side in the same career.

One person's working himself to death, the other person is knocking off, and why? Because this person over here, down deep in the heart, says, unless I'm incredibly successful  and make a lot of money in my career, I cannot receive life joyfully. How did that person's heart get there? It's got to be through words, experiences, or experiences are just interpreted things  that happen to you. In other words, it's got to be through his own thinking about things, or somebody else's  thinking, or what other people have said.

And therefore, it's right. You know, when somebody says, sticks and sells me, break my bones, what words can never  hurt me. We all know that that's not true. To a great degree, our self-imagine, what we believe in our heart, is to a great degree,  accepted by words that people have said that we can't forget. Sometimes a good counselor can tease them out a little bit and say, so your father said  that, and you never forgot that, no, so that's in there.

So at one level, yes, if you want to guard your heart, take these words and put them in  there. But does it really make sense that, for example, that man who really needed a major redo  of his inner heart and was bitter against women and had such a view of himself, that if  he just memorized the scripture, for example, just took biblical principles, even relevant  ones, and just memorized them and thought about them that that would do it, no. No, you need a living word. You need a word of life, but let me tell you where you get it. You have to put the book of Proverbs into the context of the whole Bible, and here's  what you see.

In John chapter 539, Jesus talks to the scribes and Pharisees, and he says, you study the scriptures  diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life, okay? You read the words of the Torah because you think that they give you the words of life. And Jesus goes on for a second and indicates that they are right, but then explains why  they testify of me, he says. You're right. The Bible does have the words of life, but you have to understand what the Bible is all  about.

It's about me. In Proverbs chapter 8, there's this beautiful poetic chapter in which we see God and  wisdom creating the world together. And wisdom is speaking, wisdom is personified. And wisdom is saying, I was with God as he was creating the world, as he was creating  the human race, we did it together, and you read it, and you say beautiful, beautiful,  of course, as poetry. And it's a way of saying God created the world in wisdom.

Is it, was it only poetry? Because when you get to chapter 1 of the book of John, it says, in the beginning was the  word, listen carefully. And the word was with God, and the word was God. And then it says through him, all things were made without him, nothing was made that  has been made. Wait a minute, here again we have what?

The word, alongside of God, but the word is God, making all things with God. Here's what the Bible is claiming. And here's what Jesus actually claims. Jesus is the wisdom of God, because he is the living word. He's the word that if you grasp and you put in your heart will make you wise.

Now, I want you to think about this, it's actually just struck me this week. What is wisdom? It's not just knowledge, right? We say it's knowledge applied. Wisdom is knowledge brought down to earth, brought down to earth, brought down to  street level.

It's applied. We know lots of people who are knowledgeable that they're just not smart, or they're  smart, but they're not wise. Wisdom is knowledge brought down to earth. Who is Jesus? He is God expressed.

He is God embodied. He is God's wisdom. He is God literally brought down to earth. He is God brought into human form. Oh, we talk about the glory of God.

We talk about the holiness of God, the love of God, but those are abstractions. And if you just memorize this abstraction, it's not going to change your heart. It's not going to make you wise. It's not going to pull your heart off the things that you have given your heart to. But hit this will.

Jesus Christ is God, the wisdom of God. He is the wisdom. He is the living word. He is God. Come down to earth.

Look at him. John chapter three, John chapter four, and John chapter three, Nicodemus is a spiritual  seeker. Jesus is very abrupt with him. You must be born again. John four, the Samaritan woman is a spiritual seeker.

He's so patient. John chapter 11, Lazarus is dead. Man is dead. Two bereaved sisters, Mary and Martha. Martha comes up and says, Lord, if you had been here, my brother wouldn't have died.

Mary comes up and says, Lord, if you had been here, my brother wouldn't have died. Same situation, two women saying the same thing. In one case, Jesus gives Martha a lecture. I am the resurrection in the life. In the other case, he just weeps.

Why does he weep here and preach here? Why is he abrupt here? Why is he patient here? Because Jesus Christ does not have a temperament. Jesus is consummate wisdom.

He's supreme wisdom. And he is God's wisdom. He's all the stuff you read about. You hear about. But it's all an abstraction.

It's wisdom brought down to earth. It's the holiness of God embodied in a human being. And when you see him, and when you meditate on the glory of who he is, is he's walking  through the pages of the New Testament, now you've got something that will change your  heart. But particularly, an explanation to say, only if you see what he did for you on the cross. Why does Paul say that the Greeks and the Romans saw the cross as utter foolishness?

I'll tell you why. Because the Greeks and Romans said, if you have a wise Messiah, why would he get killed  like that? Fools get punished because they deserve punishment. Fools, you know, the rod for the back of fools, it's all through the book of Proverbs. Fools are always getting punished because they deserve it.

And because there's too stupid to avoid it. If you're wise, you don't go to the cross. You don't get scourged. You don't get beaten. You don't get imprisoned.

It's foolishness. No, but see, Jesus Christ is the wisdom of God. He's consummate wisdom. But at the end of his life, he took our place. He took the place of the fools.

He got the scourging that fools deserve. He got the death that we deserve. And if you see him dying for you, you'll love him. And that's what changes the heart. Look at this.

Love her, wisdom, cherish her, embrace her. It personifies wisdom and says, it's not enough for you just to try to study a bunch  of rules. You have to be so passionately in love with wisdom. Well, here's the way to get passionately in love with wisdom. Love him.

Embrace him. Cherish him. You can do all those things literally if you see him dying on the cross. Because if you see him dying on the cross for you, then as you meditate on the glory of  who he is in the page of the New Testament, his character will be burned into your heart. And you'll get your heart back because there will be nothing, no beautiful woman, no  great career, nothing will be as beautiful as him.

And you'll get your heart back. He's the living word. He's the living word. This is the way of wisdom. Let's pray.

Our Father, we ask that you would help us to see the... We can take this very, very literally. We can guard our heart because we love wisdom. We embrace wisdom. We pursue wisdom.

We cherish wisdom because it's Jesus. And Father, as we see him walking and acting and behaving and doing things in the Bible  in a wise way, but then seeing going to the cross, as we fall in love with him, then  his example becomes more than an example. It really becomes a living word brought into our hearts, reframing and reshaping us. Please, O Lord, make us wise the way Jesus is wise. We pray the name of Him in whom all the treasures of knowledge and wisdom are hidden.

Amen.

### 引言：智慧的必要性

欢迎来到福音不受欢迎播客。我们生活中面临的许多问题都很复杂，并不是简单地遵循规则就能解决的。我现在该发声还是等待？我应该接受那份工作还是留在原地？这就是为什么智慧如此重要。但我们如何培养智慧呢？今天请加入我们，听听 Tim Keller 如何探讨我们如何将上帝的智慧应用于我们生活中的日常复杂性。如果您收听今天的教导，我们邀请您访问 gospelunlife.com 并注册电子邮件更新。当您注册时，您将收到我们的季度期刊和其他有价值的以福音为中心的资源。今天就订阅 gospelunlife.com。

今天早上的经文来自箴言第 4 章第 5 至 9 节和第 14 至 27 节。

> 得智慧，得聪明，不可忘记，也不可偏离我口中的言语。不可离弃智慧，智慧就护卫你；要爱她，她就保守你。智慧为首，所以要得智慧。在你一切所得之内，必得聪明。高举她，她就使你高升；怀抱她，她就使你尊荣。她必将华冠加在你头上，把荣冕交给你。

**我们生活在一个选择的文化中。** 我知道这通常是一个广告口号，但这确实是真的。历史上大多数地方和大多数时候，你不能选择你要嫁的人。你决定而不是你的父母是一个相对较新的想法。当然，这只是个开始。我们可以自由地成为我们想成为的人，过我们想过的生活。做我们想做的事情，因为我们的文化是世界历史上最个人主义的文化，因此我们的地位、父母和社会位置并不决定我们能做什么。我们有选择，选择，这意味着什么？这意味着我们比以往任何时候都更需要智慧，因为智慧是做出明智选择的能力。仅仅是善良和正派是不够的。这里有两个职业你可以选择。它们都是道德上允许的。没有一个是有罪的。对它们中的任何一个都没有错。但如果你选择不明智，如果你选择了不适合你的那个，你可能会失去多年的生命，实际上，这可能是一场灾难。我们比以往任何时候都更需要智慧。

### 第一部分：荣耀的争战

#### 1. 追求智慧

我们已经进行了三周的研究，这是最后一周，我们一直在研究圣经中箴言书的早期章节。我们正在研究箴言书的主题。我们一直在研究智慧是什么。它是关于生活复杂现实的能力。我们一直在研究你如何发展智慧。今天我们正在研究这段著名的经文，我们学习到智慧生活的三个特征。如果你想过一种智慧的生活，那种生活将以三件事为特征。一个荣耀的争战，一个守护的心，一个活的道。让我们来看看。

首先，智慧的道路是我们智慧生活的道路，基本上可以被描述为一个荣耀的争战。这是我想到的五到九节。得智慧，得聪明。不可离弃智慧，虽然它会花费你所有的一切，得聪明，珍惜她，拥抱她，她就会给你一个花冠来装饰你的头，并给你一个荣耀的冠冕。

贯穿整个段落的词语都是传达勤奋努力和意志力的决心。出现四次的“得”这个词实际上是指购买，意味着昂贵的购买，所以这是牺牲的语言，此外它在第七节中直接说，它会花费你所有的一切，得智慧。第六节中的“不可离弃”字面意思是不要放手，要顽强，不屈不挠。所以有牺牲，有不屈不挠。注意这里的语言，这是追求一个女人结婚的隐喻。它说不要离弃她，爱她，珍惜她，拥抱她，她就会回应你，她就会尊重你，所以这是激情和追求的语言。

### 第二部分：守护的心

#### 1. 心的重要性

第二件事，一个智慧的生活不仅以荣耀的争战为特征，还以守护的心为特征。我们所说的守护的心是什么意思？这是第二件事。考虑到箴言书完全是关于智慧和获得智慧的，23 节非常惊人，因为它本质上是在说，如果你想变得聪明，没有什么比这更重要的了。最重要的是，23 节，守护你的心，因为一切你所做的都从中流出。

这不是现代对心的理解。我们相信心是情感的种子。我们认为思想来自头脑，情感来自心。现在我们生活在一个情感被优先考虑的时代。我们有大量的科幻小说。所有《星际迷航》电影和电视剧的元叙事之一是机器有理性。你知道，机器人和计算机有理性，但我们只有，我们有情感，这就是使我们成为人类的原因。使我们成为人类的不是理性，而是情感。这就是使我们不是机器，而是人类。

### 第三部分：活的道

#### 1. 圣经的角色

答案实际上就在第 20、21 和 22 节中，它告诉你律法的教师。现在，正在对年轻人或年轻人讲话的人正在阅读箴言书，贯穿整个箴言书，不断谈论，我要给你我的话语，你需要守护我的话语，你需要接受我的话语。那些话语是什么？是律法教师的话语，也就是上帝的律法？是圣经。事实上，所有智慧文学基本上都是将上帝的律法，伟大的律法原则，带到地上应用于日常生活，将上帝的律法，伟大的原则和戒律应用于日常生活。

**耶稣是上帝的智慧，因为他是活的道。** 他是如果你掌握并放在心中会使你变得聪明的道。现在，我想让你思考这个，这实际上只是本周让我震惊。智慧是什么？不仅仅是知识，对吧？我们说这是应用的知识。智慧是知识被带到地上，被带到地上，被带到街头层面。它是应用的。我们知道很多有知识的人，他们只是没有聪明，或者他们聪明，但他们不聪明。智慧是知识被带到地上。耶稣是谁？他是上帝的表达。他是上帝的体现。他是上帝的智慧。他是上帝字面上被带到地上。他是上帝被带入人形。

让我们祷告。

我们的父，我们请求你帮助我们看到... 我们可以非常非常字面地理解这一点。我们可以守护我们的心，因为我们爱智慧。我们拥抱智慧。我们追求智慧。我们珍惜智慧，因为它是耶稣。父，当我们看到他在圣经中行走、行动、表现和做事时是多么聪明，但然后看到他走向十字架，当我们爱上他时，他的榜样就不仅仅是一个榜样。它真的成为一个活的道进入我们的心，重新塑造和重塑我们。请，哦主，使我们像耶稣一样聪明。我们祈祷他的名，在他里面隐藏着所有知识和智慧的宝藏。阿门。
