Welcome to the Gospel Unliked Podcast. Many of the questions we face in life are complex and aren't always answered by simply  following rules. Do I speak up now or do I wait? Should I take that job or say where I am? That's why wisdom is so crucial.

But how do we develop it? Today join us as Tim Keller explores how we apply God's wisdom to the everyday complexities  of our lives.

The scripture this morning is from Proverbs chapter 4 verses 5 to 9 and verses 14 to 27. Get wisdom. Get understanding. Do not forget my words or turn away from them. Do not forsake wisdom and she will protect you, love her and she will watch over you.

The beginning of wisdom is this. Get wisdom, though it costs you all you have, get understanding, cherish her and she will  exalt you, embrace her and she will honor you. She will give you a garland to grace your head and present you with a glorious crown. Do not set foot on the path of the wicked or walk in the way of the evil doers, avoid it,  do not travel on it, turn from it and go on your way. For they cannot rest until they do evil.

They are robbed of sleep till they make someone stumble. They eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of vows. The path of the righteous is like the morning sun shining ever brighter till the full  light of day. But the way of the wicked is like deep darkness. They do not know what makes them stumble.

My son, pay attention to what I say, turn your ears to my words. Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart. For they are life to those who find them and health to one's whole body. Above or else, guard your heart. For everything you do flows from it.

Keep your mouth from perversity. Keep corrupt talk far from your lips. Put your eyes look straight ahead, fix your gaze directly before you. Give careful thought to the paths for your feet and be steadfast in all your ways. Do not turn to the right or the left.

Keep your foot from evil. The word of the Lord. We live in a culture of choice. Now I know that often is an advertisement, it's a slogan, but it's really true. Most places and most times in history, you didn't choose who you married.

It's a fairly recent idea that you decided instead of your parents. But of course, that's just the beginning. We are free to be who we want to be, live as we want to live. Do the things we want to do because our culture is the most individualistic culture in the  history of the world, and therefore our place and our parents and our social location  do not determine so much what we can do. We have choices, choices, and what does that mean?

That means that we've never needed wisdom more than we do now because wisdom is the ability  to make wise choices. It's not enough just to be good and decent. Here's two careers you could choose. They're both morally permissible. Neither is sinful.

Neither of them is wrong about either of them. But if you choose unwisely, if you choose the wrong one, one that doesn't fit you, you  could lose years of your life, actually, it could be a disaster. We've never needed wisdom more than we do now. What we've been doing for three weeks, and this is the last of the three, we've been looking  at the early chapters of the book of Proverbs in the Bible. We're looking at the themes of the book of Proverbs.

We've been looking at what wisdom is. It's competence with regard to the complex realities of life. We've been looking at how you develop wisdom. Today we're looking at this famous passage where we learn three things that characterize  a wise life. If you want to lead a life of wisdom, that life will be characterized by three things.

A glorious fight, a guarded heart, a living word. Let's take a look. First of all, the way of wisdom is the way of our life of wisdom is basically, it could  be characterized as a glorious fight. This is five to nine I'm thinking of. Get wisdom, get understanding.

Do not forsake wisdom, though it cost you all you have, get understanding, cherish her,  embrace her, and she will give you a garland to grace your head and present you with a glorious  crown. The words all through there are various words that get across diligent exertion and determination  of will. The word get that comes up four times is actually the word that means purchase and it means  a costly purchase, so it's the language of sacrifice and besides that it says right there in  verse seven, it will cost you all you have, get wisdom. Do not forsake in verse six literally means don't let go of be dogged, relentlessness. So there's sacrifice, there's relentlessness.

Notice that there's a language here, it's a metaphor of pursuing a woman to marry. It says don't forsake her, love her, cherish her, embrace her, and she will respond and she  will honor you, so that's the language of passion and pursuit. So all through here, we're talking about determination of will, something that you actually  have to fight in order to keep at the very center of your life, but it's a glorious fight  because as it says, it ends with a glorious crown, some of the other verses which we won't  take the time to look at, tell you about that, gradually, gradually, see verse 18 and 19,  the path of the righteous is like the morning sun shining ever brighter until the full light  of day, the way the wicked is deep darkness, they do not know what makes them stumble. The contrast, the reason why wisdom is worth it is because as time goes on, a wise person  gets more peace, not restlessness as the verses talk about, more clarity, the understand  things that you never understood, not more and more darkness as it were, and things are  going wrong, you're stumbling, you don't even know why you're just getting more angry. Oh, my wisdom is like a glorious credit, it's worth the fight, but why is it such a fight?

Why is it such a fight? Why does it take such diligence? Why does it say, get wisdom, they'll cost you all you have, clear it, why does it take  such determination of will? Now, here we can, whether you were here the last two weeks or not, it's just as well  that we recap a bit because it's good for us. And that means the answer to that question, why is it so much fight is because first of  all, we're naturally fools, we're not blank slates that we need to fill up with foolishness  or with wisdom, we come as fools and therefore we're fighting our own nature.

And secondly, because the basic things that are being told to, excuse me, excuse me,  sir, the blinking of the camera is very, very distracting, forgive me, and I don't mean  to embarrass anybody, and I've never done that in my whole life before, but it's been  very hard. So I'm glad you're here, it's just, you know, years ago my wife would say, I would have  been a fool and not even said anything, but I'm wiser today, I'm just, I found a way  to make it okay, and you're okay and I'm okay, but okay, all right, here's two reasons. We just, if you were here two weeks ago, look, you have a temperament, right, having you  taken temperament inventories that Myers-Briggs, some are introverts, some are extroverts,  some are intuitive, some are more analytical, some of us like closure, some of us like process. Do you remember we talked about a study that across three dozen, three dozen different cultures,  we realized that there's three basic ways that were neurologically wired in order to  deal with problems, some of us retreat, instinctively, some of us attack instinctively, some  of us stand pat and wait, and if you remember what the psychologist said about all these temperaments  is that since we habitually, you know, those of us are introverts, extroverts, rational  intuitive closure process, you know, attack, hold back, we instinctively respond to situations,  the way we're wired or the way we've been raised or the way our culture has taught us,  and only a small fraction of the situations in which we find ourselves, is that natural  approach, the right one. If you attack, when you should be retreating, if you retreat, when you should be attacking,  if you stand and wait and see, when you should be acting, you can die.

And all of us are wired to instinctively act in a certain way in certain situations,  which means we have temperaments, you say, what's wrong with the temperament, everybody's  got a temperament, yeah, that's why we're all fools. Because the world doesn't have a temperament, you see, the world doesn't, if the world  was perfectly fitted to your temperament, so the introverted approach or the extroverted  approach, the speak out or the wait and listen, the come to closure or the, let's let  it go into process. If the world had a temperament and you perfectly fitted, you'd be perfectly wise with none  of us, none of us are. And therefore we're all naturally fools, and to become a wise person means that you have  to be so in touch with reality that you know how to get out beyond, you have a range  of responses that goes beyond your inborn, your culture, your psychology, your neurology,  and you know how to go against those and always act in a way that's wise. Very, very difficult.

That's why it's always a fight to be wise. You're always having to fight against the normal way you do things, but as time goes on,  if you're becoming wise, you realize, look, I hate doing it that way, I never don't like  doing it that way, but this situation calls for it, so I'm going to do it. The other reason why it's a fight is because as we saw when you looked at the book of  Proverbs, Proverbs chapter 3, the things that the Bible says are, the things that develop  wisdom are processes, and they are disciplines that you have to stay at for years and years  and years. That's the reason why wisdom actually is always a gradual thing. The path of the righteous is like the morning sun shining ever brighter and brighter to  the full way today.

Remember, one of the things the Bible says is in chapter 3 that is the root of wisdom  is the fear of the Lord. Now you hear that and you say, what is that? What we said, the fear of the Lord means to have a vital, existential relationship with  God, not just believing in Him, but a vibrant, vital relationship in which His love and  His holiness is real to you, which means a prayer life. And anybody who even just says, I'm going to pray for 30 minutes a day, you know how hard  that is. It's unbelievably hard just to keep your mind on it.

We said another thing that brings wisdom is accountability. Is having people, a fool is wise in his own eyes, so the definition of a fool is someone  who only cares what he or she thinks. That's a fool. And wise in my own eyes, my eyes, there's all that matter. I see it.

That's the way it is. Wisdom always is trying to see the thing through other people's eyes. And so the wise person has got a company of counselors and a company of advisors and  friends who are, they're all, they're never making, a wise person never makes decisions  unilaterally, but always comes and gets a lot of advice and takes it, you have to be  accountable. Do you have anybody, for example, do you have four or five people or somebody who looks  at how you spend your money? You say, well that's private, no, okay, that's also foolish.

If you get nobody else's perspective, of course you're going to be, you're going to have  all kinds of self-justifications. You might be very unwise in the way you spend your money. You'd be more wise if you were actually spending your money accountable to other people  that you trust in community. That's hard. One last thing, as we've said, I didn't tell the story on this side of the park's hotel  tea now, is you've all heard that you become wise by immersing yourself in the word  of God.

I think most of us say, and when you read the Bible, that takes, it makes you wise. Now, it takes years and years and years. I mean, after all these years of having to probably, I probably had a teacher preach on  the Bible about two or three thousand times in my life. I'm sometimes, I don't mean to discourage it, it's just starting to feel like I'm starting  to get it. In other words, passages that didn't use to make sense, start to make sense because you've  seen enough other passages, but here's the thing, it's not just the details of the Bible.

It's not just all, you know, I found a verse that says this, I didn't know I was supposed  to do that. That doesn't happen that often anymore to me, but here's what you do have to constantly  do. Alistair McIntyre, Catholic Theologian, a Catholic philosopher, tells a story in his book  After Virtue, it gives an illustration, it's a lot of fun. The illustration is, imagine you are standing at a bus stop and a man who you've never met  in your life before comes up, never met him, and he says, hey, do you know that the Latin  name for the common wild duck is histrionic, is histrionic, is histrionic, and then he walks  away. Okay, so how do you make sense of that?

It must be some reason, how do you make sense of it? And McIntyre says the only way to make sense of it is you have to put it into a story. Now it could be a sad story, and you say, maybe he's mentally ill, and that would be a sad  story, but that would make sense of it, right? It makes sense of it, yes. The other possibility is a little more of a funny story, and that is that it's mistaken  identity.

He was at a library the other day, and he was asking a librarian for a book on wild ducks,  he got the book, and he sees you at the bus stop, and you look like the librarian, you  know, your hair or your lack of hair or whatever, look, you just, it reminds you, so he thinks  you're the librarian. That's a funny story. That would make sense of it. McIntyre brings up one more possibility. He says, maybe the guy is a secret agent, and he mistakes you for his contact.

And he's giving you the code words. Now that's outlandish, but it's possible. And what he says is, unless you understand what happened in the light of a story, you  don't know how to respond. Now this world tells you that, well, this culture will tell you this, there might be  a God or might not. Nobody can know, that's what they'll tell you.

And there might be an afterlife or not, but nobody can tell you that, either. So this life is the place where you have to, if you're going to have any happen, you  have to have it right now. That's the story of the world. The Bible tells you a different story, that God created the world, and therefore you,  and therefore everything you have as a gift. And he's going to renew the world, and if you believe in him, you're going to live in  that world forever and ever, which means this life is like the vestibule to a mansion.

Your entire life here is just the tiniest little beginning of it. Which story are you going to believe? Depending on which story you believe, and depending to the degree to which that you really  take that into your heart, it affects everything. How do you spend your money? How much money do you give away?

If you put it in that story, your behavior with your money is going to be utterly different  than if you put your money in this story over here, the Bible story. And therefore, it's not just reading the Bible to get the principles and the rules out  of it, though there's lots of great principles and rules. You have to read every part of the Bible, you have to read the narratives and the poetry  and the history and everything. And more and more you do that, the more you become conversant with the Bible, the wiser  you get, the more it affects everything you do. Even where the Bible doesn't speak is directly to say, here's how much money you have to give  away exactly.

It doesn't say that. And yet, it has an immense impact on the way in which you do how you spend your money daily  depending on the story. It's a fight to be wise. It takes years and years and years, but it's a glorious fight. Second thing, a wise life is not just characterized by a glorious fight, but by a guarded heart.

What do we mean by a guarded heart? That's the second thing. Before it considering that the book of Proverbs is all about Proverbs is all about wisdom  and getting wisdom, verse 23 is pretty amazing because essentially it's saying, and there's  nothing more important than this if you're going to be wise. Above all else, verse 23, guard your heart for everything you do flows from it. Now that is not the modern understanding of the heart.

We believe the heart is the seed of the emotions. We think that the thoughts come from the head and the emotions come from the heart. Now we live in a day in time in which the emotions are privileged. We have lots and lots of science fiction. One of the meta narratives of all the Star Trek movies and television series is that machines  have reason.

You know, robots and computers have reason, but we only, we have emotions, and that's  what makes us human. What makes us human is not reason, but it's emotion. That's what makes us not a machine, but a human being. It's interesting that Greeks and the Romans saw exactly the opposite. They said the thing that makes us humans and not animals is that we have reason, but  that's another sermon.

Another story. But the point is actually, well, it's not totally different. Another story. Greeks and Romans and modern people have always pitted the emotions versus the reason. Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer?

Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith? For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding  of what it means to follow Christ. A great resource to start using this summer is the new city catechism devotional, God's  truth for our hearts and minds. This devotional brings the historic catechisms of the Christian Church to life, offering  a question to consider for each week of the year. In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catechesis, the rich and communal  practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers that frame the foundational beliefs  of the Christian faith.

Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer, and a brief meditation that will challenge  and inspire you. The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller,  and Kevin De Young, as well as historical figures such as Augustine, John Calvin, and  Martin Luther. This month, in addition to the new city catechism devotional, we are including a great companion  resource, the new city catechism for kids, as our thank you for your gift to help gospel  and life share the hope of Christ's love with people all over the world. So request your copies today at gospelonlife.com slash give, that's gospelonlife.com slash give. Now here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching.

You think these things, you feel these things, and we live today in a time in which we  say, well, owning your feelings and expressing your feelings and making them work for you  and being true to your feelings, that's what means it means to be an authentic well-integrated  human being. Two weeks ago, there was an article in the New York Times magazine called, Can emotional  intelligence be taught in schools? And today, we don't have that concept of wisdom that the Bible has in our culture, but  we do have the concept of emotional intelligence, which is almost the closest thing we've got. Emotional intelligence, according to that article, is more predictive of success in life  than academic achievement. And emotional intelligence, by that, they mean the ability to know your own emotions and  then manage them.

So it's all about managing your emotions, reframing them to make sure that they don't  run away with you, but owning up to them, and that's considered wisdom. Now, I have to say, if you read the Book of Proverbs, you understand why studies are showing  that people who can control their emotions and understand their emotions have better  life outcomes than people who can't, because that's part of wisdom in the Book of Proverbs. But it's not the most important part, because believe it or not, when you're dealing with  people's emotions and when you think, oh, I've gotten down to their emotions, now they're  getting down to their feelings, now I've gotten down to the bedrock of who they are. According to the Bible, no, you haven't. Because look what it says here, and then look at the verses afterwards.

It says, guard your heart for everything flows from it. You go through the rest of the book of the Bible, and even just the Proverbs. You'll see often it talks about thinking with the heart, or acting with the heart, not  just feeling with the heart. This does not say, the heart is the seed of the emotion, the emotions flow from the heart,  but the brain has a reason to think what it says. Everything flows from the heart.

And afterwards it actually says, what your mouth says, what your eyes perceive, and what  your body does, is all flowing from the heart. Why? Because the Bible believes that the heart is actually the seed of your most fundamental commitments,  your most fundamental hopes and trusts. It is the things, let me say this carefully, I'll try to say twice, just so it sinks in. It is where you hold the beliefs about the things you think you must have in order  to receive life joyfully.

Everybody believes there's some things we must have to receive life joyfully. If I have that, then I can be joyful. Then my life has meaning, then I'm secure, then I know I'm worth something. Everybody has a set of beliefs of things, if I have that, then I can receive life joyfully. And what your heart chooses to believe affects everything else.

What the heart chooses, the mind perceives and finds reasonable, the emotions desire and  find beautiful. The will does and finds practical. So what your heart believes, you must have in order to receive life joyfully, what your  heart most rests in, trusts in, hopes in, that is what sets your mind, your will and  your emotions, what you perceive, what you feel about what you perceive, and what you  do about what you perceive. Because from the heart comes everything, now unless you get down to that level, you want  to understand yourself. And I remember some years ago, two men, young men, both engaged and in both cases, their  fiancees broke it off.

Both cases, the women broke off the engagement. I was passionately involved with both of them, and they didn't know each other. They were separate couples. And they were both pretty devastated by, of course. And they were both pretty angry, angry feelings of anger toward the women.

One man, however, did forgive, it was hard, hard work, forgave. The woman who broke up with him and moved on and dated other women and eventually found  a woman and married her and had a wonderful, wonderful marriage that a man couldn't get  past it, not at all, stayed bitter, and it poisoned all the other relationships he ever had. Because he couldn't forgive that woman who had done that to him, he didn't trust women. In other words, it flowed out. And so he didn't trust women.

He assumed they all were this way or that way, and so he was suspicious of him, and therefore  he was extremely unwise in the way which he related to them. And relationship after relationship blew up, and he blames it on women, it was actually  him. A little bit like somebody who says, he got drunk on vodka and soda water on Tuesday night,  he got drunk on bourbon and soda water Wednesday night, he got drunk on tequila and soda water. Do you do that Thursday night? And he says, so what is it that got him drunk every night, obviously, the soda water?

Why couldn't he get it through it? And you know why? Oh, he couldn't control his feelings, oh yes, emotional intelligence, you have to reframe  things, you have to realize, you have to count to 10, you have to think, well, maybe the  woman was this and that, no, no, no, no, no, they were both very beautiful women. In both cases, really, really beautiful women, physically beautiful. And they broke up.

The guy who forgave and moved on and got another woman and got married, she wasn't anywhere  near as physically beautiful, but it wasn't so important to him, but it was extraordinarily  important to the other guy. Because down deep in his heart, he said, here's how I know I'm really somebody, and that  is I got a beautiful wife. A wife that other guys are jealous of, see. There's a whole lot of reasons why if you make, if you do that, it's would have been  a bad marriage anyway, but I'll tell you. The fact of the matter was, he couldn't receive life joyfully unless he had a really,  you know, a woman who is just absolutely gorgeous, that everybody would be jealous of.

And he just didn't see anything wrong with that, he lost his heart, he didn't guard his  heart, he didn't lose his heart to her. He lost his heart to something that he had actually given it to, a kind of savior,  a kind of, this is what's going to make your life okay. If you know anything about the life of Jacob in the book of Genesis, it's kind of what  he did with Rachel. If somebody, if a woman like that was willing to marry me, boy, then that would heal  all the rest of my nasty life. See, unless you're willing to get down to your beliefs, your commitments, your hopes,  your trust, you're not going to have any ability to handle your emotions, so guard your  heart.

That leaves us to the last issue, how do you do that? See, it's not, it's not now a matter of what are in the world are you, what does guard  your heart mean? See, when you first read that, you probably think, be careful about your emotions. Oh, it's a lot more, it's not more difficult than that. There are ways to manage your emotions, you can just stuff your emotions, you can learn  breathing techniques, you can, you know, you could read the New York Times article, there's  talk about reframing.

You know, it was a little boy named Anthony, he's nine years old, and he did something  in school, and all the kids laughed at him, and he was furious, and he started fighting,  so they brought him into a emotional intelligence session. It's in the article, and they sat down, they tried to help him to both control his anger,  when he starts to get angry, he tells himself things, and reframe it. What does it mean, reframe? Is it, well, the teacher said, are you sure that the kids were laughing at you because they  thought you were stupid and mean, are you sure they just weren't nervous? And they didn't know what to say, so they were just being awkward.

So he thought about it, and he said, well, I think you're probably right about some  of them, but some of them really, you know, meant, you know, some of them were just laughing  at me, but you see, the teacher couldn't go down any deeper and say, well, okay, so  now, let's talk about, you know, what in the world are you, so what, if the kids laughed  at you, you see, the teacher had to try to make them say, the children weren't really  being mean to you, they were just being awkward, but he kept insisting, no, they were being  mean, and then the teacher didn't know where to go. Now you have, listen, there is something a lot deeper according to the Bible than just  controlling your emotions, it's guarding your heart, how are you going to do that? Well, the answer is actually right here in verse 20, 21 and 22, it tells you the teacher  of the Torah. Now the person who is addressing the young man or young man is reading the book of Proverbs,  all through the book of Proverbs, keeps talking about, I'm going to give you my words, and  you need to guard my words, and you need to take my words. What are those words?

Are the words of the teacher of the Torah, which is the law of God? It's the scripture. And the book of Proverbs, in fact, all the wisdom literature is basically taking the law of  God, the great principles of the law of God, and bringing them down to earth into daily  life, applying the law of God, the great principles and precepts of the law of God into daily  life. And so what he says is this, listen carefully, my son, pay attention to what I say, turn  your ear to my words, do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart,  for they are life to those who find them and health to one's whole body. They are life to those who find them and health to one's whole body.

Now that's interesting, because you want to guard your heart, he says, take my words. Now these aren't just a person's words, these are the words of the Torah. Take the words of the Bible as it were, that I'm going to teach you, and put them into  your heart. And you see how strong the claim is here? He doesn't just simply say, live by them.

He says, the words I give you are life. You put them in your heart, and that's going to guard your heart now, at one level that  makes perfect sense, because how do you come to your beliefs, by the way? How do you decide if a really beautiful woman loves me, then I'll be okay? How did that happen? How do you decide if this or that happens, then if I have money, if I have wealth, if  my career goes well, you know, two people walk side by side in the same career.

One person's working himself to death, the other person is knocking off, and why? Because this person over here, down deep in the heart, says, unless I'm incredibly successful  and make a lot of money in my career, I cannot receive life joyfully. How did that person's heart get there? It's got to be through words, experiences, or experiences are just interpreted things  that happen to you. In other words, it's got to be through his own thinking about things, or somebody else's  thinking, or what other people have said.

And therefore, it's right. You know, when somebody says, sticks and sells me, break my bones, what words can never  hurt me. We all know that that's not true. To a great degree, our self-imagine, what we believe in our heart, is to a great degree,  accepted by words that people have said that we can't forget. Sometimes a good counselor can tease them out a little bit and say, so your father said  that, and you never forgot that, no, so that's in there.

So at one level, yes, if you want to guard your heart, take these words and put them in  there. But does it really make sense that, for example, that man who really needed a major redo  of his inner heart and was bitter against women and had such a view of himself, that if  he just memorized the scripture, for example, just took biblical principles, even relevant  ones, and just memorized them and thought about them that that would do it, no. No, you need a living word. You need a word of life, but let me tell you where you get it. You have to put the book of Proverbs into the context of the whole Bible, and here's  what you see.

In John chapter 539, Jesus talks to the scribes and Pharisees, and he says, you study the scriptures  diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life, okay? You read the words of the Torah because you think that they give you the words of life. And Jesus goes on for a second and indicates that they are right, but then explains why  they testify of me, he says. You're right. The Bible does have the words of life, but you have to understand what the Bible is all  about.

It's about me. In Proverbs chapter 8, there's this beautiful poetic chapter in which we see God and  wisdom creating the world together. And wisdom is speaking, wisdom is personified. And wisdom is saying, I was with God as he was creating the world, as he was creating  the human race, we did it together, and you read it, and you say beautiful, beautiful,  of course, as poetry. And it's a way of saying God created the world in wisdom.

Is it, was it only poetry? Because when you get to chapter 1 of the book of John, it says, in the beginning was the  word, listen carefully. And the word was with God, and the word was God. And then it says through him, all things were made without him, nothing was made that  has been made. Wait a minute, here again we have what?

The word, alongside of God, but the word is God, making all things with God. Here's what the Bible is claiming. And here's what Jesus actually claims. Jesus is the wisdom of God, because he is the living word. He's the word that if you grasp and you put in your heart will make you wise.

Now, I want you to think about this, it's actually just struck me this week. What is wisdom? It's not just knowledge, right? We say it's knowledge applied. Wisdom is knowledge brought down to earth, brought down to earth, brought down to  street level.

It's applied. We know lots of people who are knowledgeable that they're just not smart, or they're  smart, but they're not wise. Wisdom is knowledge brought down to earth. Who is Jesus? He is God expressed.

He is God embodied. He is God's wisdom. He is God literally brought down to earth. He is God brought into human form. Oh, we talk about the glory of God.

We talk about the holiness of God, the love of God, but those are abstractions. And if you just memorize this abstraction, it's not going to change your heart. It's not going to make you wise. It's not going to pull your heart off the things that you have given your heart to. But hit this will.

Jesus Christ is God, the wisdom of God. He is the wisdom. He is the living word. He is God. Come down to earth.

Look at him. John chapter three, John chapter four, and John chapter three, Nicodemus is a spiritual  seeker. Jesus is very abrupt with him. You must be born again. John four, the Samaritan woman is a spiritual seeker.

He's so patient. John chapter 11, Lazarus is dead. Man is dead. Two bereaved sisters, Mary and Martha. Martha comes up and says, Lord, if you had been here, my brother wouldn't have died.

Mary comes up and says, Lord, if you had been here, my brother wouldn't have died. Same situation, two women saying the same thing. In one case, Jesus gives Martha a lecture. I am the resurrection in the life. In the other case, he just weeps.

Why does he weep here and preach here? Why is he abrupt here? Why is he patient here? Because Jesus Christ does not have a temperament. Jesus is consummate wisdom.

He's supreme wisdom. And he is God's wisdom. He's all the stuff you read about. You hear about. But it's all an abstraction.

It's wisdom brought down to earth. It's the holiness of God embodied in a human being. And when you see him, and when you meditate on the glory of who he is, is he's walking  through the pages of the New Testament, now you've got something that will change your  heart. But particularly, an explanation to say, only if you see what he did for you on the cross. Why does Paul say that the Greeks and the Romans saw the cross as utter foolishness?

I'll tell you why. Because the Greeks and Romans said, if you have a wise Messiah, why would he get killed  like that? Fools get punished because they deserve punishment. Fools, you know, the rod for the back of fools, it's all through the book of Proverbs. Fools are always getting punished because they deserve it.

And because there's too stupid to avoid it. If you're wise, you don't go to the cross. You don't get scourged. You don't get beaten. You don't get imprisoned.

It's foolishness. No, but see, Jesus Christ is the wisdom of God. He's consummate wisdom. But at the end of his life, he took our place. He took the place of the fools.

He got the scourging that fools deserve. He got the death that we deserve. And if you see him dying for you, you'll love him. And that's what changes the heart. Look at this.

Love her, wisdom, cherish her, embrace her. It personifies wisdom and says, it's not enough for you just to try to study a bunch  of rules. You have to be so passionately in love with wisdom. Well, here's the way to get passionately in love with wisdom. Love him.

Embrace him. Cherish him. You can do all those things literally if you see him dying on the cross. Because if you see him dying on the cross for you, then as you meditate on the glory of  who he is in the page of the New Testament, his character will be burned into your heart. And you'll get your heart back because there will be nothing, no beautiful woman, no  great career, nothing will be as beautiful as him.

And you'll get your heart back. He's the living word. He's the living word. This is the way of wisdom. Let's pray.

Our Father, we ask that you would help us to see the... We can take this very, very literally. We can guard our heart because we love wisdom. We embrace wisdom. We pursue wisdom.

We cherish wisdom because it's Jesus. And Father, as we see him walking and acting and behaving and doing things in the Bible  in a wise way, but then seeing going to the cross, as we fall in love with him, then  his example becomes more than an example. It really becomes a living word brought into our hearts, reframing and reshaping us. Please, O Lord, make us wise the way Jesus is wise. We pray the name of Him in whom all the treasures of knowledge and wisdom are hidden.

Amen.

The scripture this morning is from Proverbs chapter 4 verses 5 to 9 and verses 14 to 27. Get wisdom. Get understanding. Do not forget my words or turn away from them. Do not forsake wisdom and she will protect you, love her and she will watch over you.

The beginning of wisdom is this. Get wisdom, though it costs you all you have, get understanding, cherish her and she will  exalt you, embrace her and she will honor you. She will give you a garland to grace your head and present you with a glorious crown. Do not set foot on the path of the wicked or walk in the way of the evil doers, avoid it,  do not travel on it, turn from it and go on your way. For they cannot rest until they do evil.

They are robbed of sleep till they make someone stumble. They eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of vows. The path of the righteous is like the morning sun shining ever brighter till the full  light of day. But the way of the wicked is like deep darkness. They do not know what makes them stumble.

My son, pay attention to what I say, turn your ears to my words. Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart. For they are life to those who find them and health to one's whole body. Above or else, guard your heart. For everything you do flows from it.

Keep your mouth from perversity. Keep corrupt talk far from your lips. Put your eyes look straight ahead, fix your gaze directly before you. Give careful thought to the paths for your feet and be steadfast in all your ways. Do not turn to the right or the left.

Keep your foot from evil. The word of the Lord. We live in a culture of choice. Now I know that often is an advertisement, it's a slogan, but it's really true. Most places and most times in history, you didn't choose who you married.

It's a fairly recent idea that you decided instead of your parents. But of course, that's just the beginning. We are free to be who we want to be, live as we want to live. Do the things we want to do because our culture is the most individualistic culture in the  history of the world, and therefore our place and our parents and our social location  do not determine so much what we can do. We have choices, choices, and what does that mean?

That means that we've never needed wisdom more than we do now because wisdom is the ability  to make wise choices. It's not enough just to be good and decent. Here's two careers you could choose. They're both morally permissible. Neither is sinful.

Neither of them is wrong about either of them. But if you choose unwisely, if you choose the wrong one, one that doesn't fit you, you  could lose years of your life, actually, it could be a disaster. We've never needed wisdom more than we do now. What we've been doing for three weeks, and this is the last of the three, we've been looking  at the early chapters of the book of Proverbs in the Bible. We're looking at the themes of the book of Proverbs.

We've been looking at what wisdom is. It's competence with regard to the complex realities of life. We've been looking at how you develop wisdom. Today we're looking at this famous passage where we learn three things that characterize  a wise life. If you want to lead a life of wisdom, that life will be characterized by three things.

A glorious fight, a guarded heart, a living word. Let's take a look. First of all, the way of wisdom is the way of our life of wisdom is basically, it could  be characterized as a glorious fight. This is five to nine I'm thinking of. Get wisdom, get understanding.

Do not forsake wisdom, though it cost you all you have, get understanding, cherish her,  embrace her, and she will give you a garland to grace your head and present you with a glorious  crown. The words all through there are various words that get across diligent exertion and determination  of will. The word get that comes up four times is actually the word that means purchase and it means  a costly purchase, so it's the language of sacrifice and besides that it says right there in  verse seven, it will cost you all you have, get wisdom. Do not forsake in verse six literally means don't let go of be dogged, relentlessness. So there's sacrifice, there's relentlessness.

Notice that there's a language here, it's a metaphor of pursuing a woman to marry. It says don't forsake her, love her, cherish her, embrace her, and she will respond and she  will honor you, so that's the language of passion and pursuit. So all through here, we're talking about determination of will, something that you actually  have to fight in order to keep at the very center of your life, but it's a glorious fight  because as it says, it ends with a glorious crown, some of the other verses which we won't  take the time to look at, tell you about that, gradually, gradually, see verse 18 and 19,  the path of the righteous is like the morning sun shining ever brighter until the full light  of day, the way the wicked is deep darkness, they do not know what makes them stumble. The contrast, the reason why wisdom is worth it is because as time goes on, a wise person  gets more peace, not restlessness as the verses talk about, more clarity, the understand  things that you never understood, not more and more darkness as it were, and things are  going wrong, you're stumbling, you don't even know why you're just getting more angry. Oh, my wisdom is like a glorious credit, it's worth the fight, but why is it such a fight?

Why is it such a fight? Why does it take such diligence? Why does it say, get wisdom, they'll cost you all you have, clear it, why does it take  such determination of will? Now, here we can, whether you were here the last two weeks or not, it's just as well  that we recap a bit because it's good for us. And that means the answer to that question, why is it so much fight is because first of  all, we're naturally fools, we're not blank slates that we need to fill up with foolishness  or with wisdom, we come as fools and therefore we're fighting our own nature.

And secondly, because the basic things that are being told to, excuse me, excuse me,  sir, the blinking of the camera is very, very distracting, forgive me, and I don't mean  to embarrass anybody, and I've never done that in my whole life before, but it's been  very hard. So I'm glad you're here, it's just, you know, years ago my wife would say, I would have  been a fool and not even said anything, but I'm wiser today, I'm just, I found a way  to make it okay, and you're okay and I'm okay, but okay, all right, here's two reasons. We just, if you were here two weeks ago, look, you have a temperament, right, having you  taken temperament inventories that Myers-Briggs, some are introverts, some are extroverts,  some are intuitive, some are more analytical, some of us like closure, some of us like process. Do you remember we talked about a study that across three dozen, three dozen different cultures,  we realized that there's three basic ways that were neurologically wired in order to  deal with problems, some of us retreat, instinctively, some of us attack instinctively, some  of us stand pat and wait, and if you remember what the psychologist said about all these temperaments  is that since we habitually, you know, those of us are introverts, extroverts, rational  intuitive closure process, you know, attack, hold back, we instinctively respond to situations,  the way we're wired or the way we've been raised or the way our culture has taught us,  and only a small fraction of the situations in which we find ourselves, is that natural  approach, the right one. If you attack, when you should be retreating, if you retreat, when you should be attacking,  if you stand and wait and see, when you should be acting, you can die.

And all of us are wired to instinctively act in a certain way in certain situations,  which means we have temperaments, you say, what's wrong with the temperament, everybody's  got a temperament, yeah, that's why we're all fools. Because the world doesn't have a temperament, you see, the world doesn't, if the world  was perfectly fitted to your temperament, so the introverted approach or the extroverted  approach, the speak out or the wait and listen, the come to closure or the, let's let  it go into process. If the world had a temperament and you perfectly fitted, you'd be perfectly wise with none  of us, none of us are. And therefore we're all naturally fools, and to become a wise person means that you have  to be so in touch with reality that you know how to get out beyond, you have a range  of responses that goes beyond your inborn, your culture, your psychology, your neurology,  and you know how to go against those and always act in a way that's wise. Very, very difficult.

That's why it's always a fight to be wise. You're always having to fight against the normal way you do things, but as time goes on,  if you're becoming wise, you realize, look, I hate doing it that way, I never don't like  doing it that way, but this situation calls for it, so I'm going to do it. The other reason why it's a fight is because as we saw when you looked at the book of  Proverbs, Proverbs chapter 3, the things that the Bible says are, the things that develop  wisdom are processes, and they are disciplines that you have to stay at for years and years  and years. That's the reason why wisdom actually is always a gradual thing. The path of the righteous is like the morning sun shining ever brighter and brighter to  the full way today.

Remember, one of the things the Bible says is in chapter 3 that is the root of wisdom  is the fear of the Lord. Now you hear that and you say, what is that? What we said, the fear of the Lord means to have a vital, existential relationship with  God, not just believing in Him, but a vibrant, vital relationship in which His love and  His holiness is real to you, which means a prayer life. And anybody who even just says, I'm going to pray for 30 minutes a day, you know how hard  that is. It's unbelievably hard just to keep your mind on it.

We said another thing that brings wisdom is accountability. Is having people, a fool is wise in his own eyes, so the definition of a fool is someone  who only cares what he or she thinks. That's a fool. And wise in my own eyes, my eyes, there's all that matter. I see it.

That's the way it is. Wisdom always is trying to see the thing through other people's eyes. And so the wise person has got a company of counselors and a company of advisors and  friends who are, they're all, they're never making, a wise person never makes decisions  unilaterally, but always comes and gets a lot of advice and takes it, you have to be  accountable. Do you have anybody, for example, do you have four or five people or somebody who looks  at how you spend your money? You say, well that's private, no, okay, that's also foolish.

If you get nobody else's perspective, of course you're going to be, you're going to have  all kinds of self-justifications. You might be very unwise in the way you spend your money. You'd be more wise if you were actually spending your money accountable to other people  that you trust in community. That's hard. One last thing, as we've said, I didn't tell the story on this side of the park's hotel  tea now, is you've all heard that you become wise by immersing yourself in the word  of God.

I think most of us say, and when you read the Bible, that takes, it makes you wise. Now, it takes years and years and years. I mean, after all these years of having to probably, I probably had a teacher preach on  the Bible about two or three thousand times in my life. I'm sometimes, I don't mean to discourage it, it's just starting to feel like I'm starting  to get it. In other words, passages that didn't use to make sense, start to make sense because you've  seen enough other passages, but here's the thing, it's not just the details of the Bible.

It's not just all, you know, I found a verse that says this, I didn't know I was supposed  to do that. That doesn't happen that often anymore to me, but here's what you do have to constantly  do. Alistair McIntyre, Catholic Theologian, a Catholic philosopher, tells a story in his book  After Virtue, it gives an illustration, it's a lot of fun. The illustration is, imagine you are standing at a bus stop and a man who you've never met  in your life before comes up, never met him, and he says, hey, do you know that the Latin  name for the common wild duck is histrionic, is histrionic, is histrionic, and then he walks  away. Okay, so how do you make sense of that?

It must be some reason, how do you make sense of it? And McIntyre says the only way to make sense of it is you have to put it into a story. Now it could be a sad story, and you say, maybe he's mentally ill, and that would be a sad  story, but that would make sense of it, right? It makes sense of it, yes. The other possibility is a little more of a funny story, and that is that it's mistaken  identity.

He was at a library the other day, and he was asking a librarian for a book on wild ducks,  he got the book, and he sees you at the bus stop, and you look like the librarian, you  know, your hair or your lack of hair or whatever, look, you just, it reminds you, so he thinks  you're the librarian. That's a funny story. That would make sense of it. McIntyre brings up one more possibility. He says, maybe the guy is a secret agent, and he mistakes you for his contact.

And he's giving you the code words. Now that's outlandish, but it's possible. And what he says is, unless you understand what happened in the light of a story, you  don't know how to respond. Now this world tells you that, well, this culture will tell you this, there might be  a God or might not. Nobody can know, that's what they'll tell you.

And there might be an afterlife or not, but nobody can tell you that, either. So this life is the place where you have to, if you're going to have any happen, you  have to have it right now. That's the story of the world. The Bible tells you a different story, that God created the world, and therefore you,  and therefore everything you have as a gift. And he's going to renew the world, and if you believe in him, you're going to live in  that world forever and ever, which means this life is like the vestibule to a mansion.

Your entire life here is just the tiniest little beginning of it. Which story are you going to believe? Depending on which story you believe, and depending to the degree to which that you really  take that into your heart, it affects everything. How do you spend your money? How much money do you give away?

If you put it in that story, your behavior with your money is going to be utterly different  than if you put your money in this story over here, the Bible story. And therefore, it's not just reading the Bible to get the principles and the rules out  of it, though there's lots of great principles and rules. You have to read every part of the Bible, you have to read the narratives and the poetry  and the history and everything. And more and more you do that, the more you become conversant with the Bible, the wiser  you get, the more it affects everything you do. Even where the Bible doesn't speak is directly to say, here's how much money you have to give  away exactly.

It doesn't say that. And yet, it has an immense impact on the way in which you do how you spend your money daily  depending on the story. It's a fight to be wise. It takes years and years and years, but it's a glorious fight. Second thing, a wise life is not just characterized by a glorious fight, but by a guarded heart.

What do we mean by a guarded heart? That's the second thing. Before it considering that the book of Proverbs is all about Proverbs is all about wisdom  and getting wisdom, verse 23 is pretty amazing because essentially it's saying, and there's  nothing more important than this if you're going to be wise. Above all else, verse 23, guard your heart for everything you do flows from it. Now that is not the modern understanding of the heart.

We believe the heart is the seed of the emotions. We think that the thoughts come from the head and the emotions come from the heart. Now we live in a day in time in which the emotions are privileged. We have lots and lots of science fiction. One of the meta narratives of all the Star Trek movies and television series is that machines  have reason.

You know, robots and computers have reason, but we only, we have emotions, and that's  what makes us human. What makes us human is not reason, but it's emotion. That's what makes us not a machine, but a human being. It's interesting that Greeks and the Romans saw exactly the opposite. They said the thing that makes us humans and not animals is that we have reason, but  that's another sermon.

Another story. But the point is actually, well, it's not totally different. Another story. Greeks and Romans and modern people have always pitted the emotions versus the reason. Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer?

Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith? For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding  of what it means to follow Christ. A great resource to start using this summer is the new city catechism devotional, God's  truth for our hearts and minds. This devotional brings the historic catechisms of the Christian Church to life, offering  a question to consider for each week of the year. In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catechesis, the rich and communal  practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers that frame the foundational beliefs  of the Christian faith.

Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer, and a brief meditation that will challenge  and inspire you. The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller,  and Kevin De Young, as well as historical figures such as Augustine, John Calvin, and  Martin Luther. This month, in addition to the new city catechism devotional, we are including a great companion  resource, the new city catechism for kids, as our thank you for your gift to help gospel  and life share the hope of Christ's love with people all over the world. So request your copies today at gospelonlife.com slash give, that's gospelonlife.com slash give. Now here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching.

You think these things, you feel these things, and we live today in a time in which we  say, well, owning your feelings and expressing your feelings and making them work for you  and being true to your feelings, that's what means it means to be an authentic well-integrated  human being. Two weeks ago, there was an article in the New York Times magazine called, Can emotional  intelligence be taught in schools? And today, we don't have that concept of wisdom that the Bible has in our culture, but  we do have the concept of emotional intelligence, which is almost the closest thing we've got. Emotional intelligence, according to that article, is more predictive of success in life  than academic achievement. And emotional intelligence, by that, they mean the ability to know your own emotions and  then manage them.

So it's all about managing your emotions, reframing them to make sure that they don't  run away with you, but owning up to them, and that's considered wisdom. Now, I have to say, if you read the Book of Proverbs, you understand why studies are showing  that people who can control their emotions and understand their emotions have better  life outcomes than people who can't, because that's part of wisdom in the Book of Proverbs. But it's not the most important part, because believe it or not, when you're dealing with  people's emotions and when you think, oh, I've gotten down to their emotions, now they're  getting down to their feelings, now I've gotten down to the bedrock of who they are. According to the Bible, no, you haven't. Because look what it says here, and then look at the verses afterwards.

It says, guard your heart for everything flows from it. You go through the rest of the book of the Bible, and even just the Proverbs. You'll see often it talks about thinking with the heart, or acting with the heart, not  just feeling with the heart. This does not say, the heart is the seed of the emotion, the emotions flow from the heart,  but the brain has a reason to think what it says. Everything flows from the heart.

And afterwards it actually says, what your mouth says, what your eyes perceive, and what  your body does, is all flowing from the heart. Why? Because the Bible believes that the heart is actually the seed of your most fundamental commitments,  your most fundamental hopes and trusts. It is the things, let me say this carefully, I'll try to say twice, just so it sinks in. It is where you hold the beliefs about the things you think you must have in order  to receive life joyfully.

Everybody believes there's some things we must have to receive life joyfully. If I have that, then I can be joyful. Then my life has meaning, then I'm secure, then I know I'm worth something. Everybody has a set of beliefs of things, if I have that, then I can receive life joyfully. And what your heart chooses to believe affects everything else.

What the heart chooses, the mind perceives and finds reasonable, the emotions desire and  find beautiful. The will does and finds practical. So what your heart believes, you must have in order to receive life joyfully, what your  heart most rests in, trusts in, hopes in, that is what sets your mind, your will and  your emotions, what you perceive, what you feel about what you perceive, and what you  do about what you perceive. Because from the heart comes everything, now unless you get down to that level, you want  to understand yourself. And I remember some years ago, two men, young men, both engaged and in both cases, their  fiancees broke it off.

Both cases, the women broke off the engagement. I was passionately involved with both of them, and they didn't know each other. They were separate couples. And they were both pretty devastated by, of course. And they were both pretty angry, angry feelings of anger toward the women.

One man, however, did forgive, it was hard, hard work, forgave. The woman who broke up with him and moved on and dated other women and eventually found  a woman and married her and had a wonderful, wonderful marriage that a man couldn't get  past it, not at all, stayed bitter, and it poisoned all the other relationships he ever had. Because he couldn't forgive that woman who had done that to him, he didn't trust women. In other words, it flowed out. And so he didn't trust women.

He assumed they all were this way or that way, and so he was suspicious of him, and therefore  he was extremely unwise in the way which he related to them. And relationship after relationship blew up, and he blames it on women, it was actually  him. A little bit like somebody who says, he got drunk on vodka and soda water on Tuesday night,  he got drunk on bourbon and soda water Wednesday night, he got drunk on tequila and soda water. Do you do that Thursday night? And he says, so what is it that got him drunk every night, obviously, the soda water?

Why couldn't he get it through it? And you know why? Oh, he couldn't control his feelings, oh yes, emotional intelligence, you have to reframe  things, you have to realize, you have to count to 10, you have to think, well, maybe the  woman was this and that, no, no, no, no, no, they were both very beautiful women. In both cases, really, really beautiful women, physically beautiful. And they broke up.

The guy who forgave and moved on and got another woman and got married, she wasn't anywhere  near as physically beautiful, but it wasn't so important to him, but it was extraordinarily  important to the other guy. Because down deep in his heart, he said, here's how I know I'm really somebody, and that  is I got a beautiful wife. A wife that other guys are jealous of, see. There's a whole lot of reasons why if you make, if you do that, it's would have been  a bad marriage anyway, but I'll tell you. The fact of the matter was, he couldn't receive life joyfully unless he had a really,  you know, a woman who is just absolutely gorgeous, that everybody would be jealous of.

And he just didn't see anything wrong with that, he lost his heart, he didn't guard his  heart, he didn't lose his heart to her. He lost his heart to something that he had actually given it to, a kind of savior,  a kind of, this is what's going to make your life okay. If you know anything about the life of Jacob in the book of Genesis, it's kind of what  he did with Rachel. If somebody, if a woman like that was willing to marry me, boy, then that would heal  all the rest of my nasty life. See, unless you're willing to get down to your beliefs, your commitments, your hopes,  your trust, you're not going to have any ability to handle your emotions, so guard your  heart.

That leaves us to the last issue, how do you do that? See, it's not, it's not now a matter of what are in the world are you, what does guard  your heart mean? See, when you first read that, you probably think, be careful about your emotions. Oh, it's a lot more, it's not more difficult than that. There are ways to manage your emotions, you can just stuff your emotions, you can learn  breathing techniques, you can, you know, you could read the New York Times article, there's  talk about reframing.

You know, it was a little boy named Anthony, he's nine years old, and he did something  in school, and all the kids laughed at him, and he was furious, and he started fighting,  so they brought him into a emotional intelligence session. It's in the article, and they sat down, they tried to help him to both control his anger,  when he starts to get angry, he tells himself things, and reframe it. What does it mean, reframe? Is it, well, the teacher said, are you sure that the kids were laughing at you because they  thought you were stupid and mean, are you sure they just weren't nervous? And they didn't know what to say, so they were just being awkward.

So he thought about it, and he said, well, I think you're probably right about some  of them, but some of them really, you know, meant, you know, some of them were just laughing  at me, but you see, the teacher couldn't go down any deeper and say, well, okay, so  now, let's talk about, you know, what in the world are you, so what, if the kids laughed  at you, you see, the teacher had to try to make them say, the children weren't really  being mean to you, they were just being awkward, but he kept insisting, no, they were being  mean, and then the teacher didn't know where to go. Now you have, listen, there is something a lot deeper according to the Bible than just  controlling your emotions, it's guarding your heart, how are you going to do that? Well, the answer is actually right here in verse 20, 21 and 22, it tells you the teacher  of the Torah. Now the person who is addressing the young man or young man is reading the book of Proverbs,  all through the book of Proverbs, keeps talking about, I'm going to give you my words, and  you need to guard my words, and you need to take my words. What are those words?

Are the words of the teacher of the Torah, which is the law of God? It's the scripture. And the book of Proverbs, in fact, all the wisdom literature is basically taking the law of  God, the great principles of the law of God, and bringing them down to earth into daily  life, applying the law of God, the great principles and precepts of the law of God into daily  life. And so what he says is this, listen carefully, my son, pay attention to what I say, turn  your ear to my words, do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart,  for they are life to those who find them and health to one's whole body. They are life to those who find them and health to one's whole body.

Now that's interesting, because you want to guard your heart, he says, take my words. Now these aren't just a person's words, these are the words of the Torah. Take the words of the Bible as it were, that I'm going to teach you, and put them into  your heart. And you see how strong the claim is here? He doesn't just simply say, live by them.

He says, the words I give you are life. You put them in your heart, and that's going to guard your heart now, at one level that  makes perfect sense, because how do you come to your beliefs, by the way? How do you decide if a really beautiful woman loves me, then I'll be okay? How did that happen? How do you decide if this or that happens, then if I have money, if I have wealth, if  my career goes well, you know, two people walk side by side in the same career.

One person's working himself to death, the other person is knocking off, and why? Because this person over here, down deep in the heart, says, unless I'm incredibly successful  and make a lot of money in my career, I cannot receive life joyfully. How did that person's heart get there? It's got to be through words, experiences, or experiences are just interpreted things  that happen to you. In other words, it's got to be through his own thinking about things, or somebody else's  thinking, or what other people have said.

And therefore, it's right. You know, when somebody says, sticks and sells me, break my bones, what words can never  hurt me. We all know that that's not true. To a great degree, our self-imagine, what we believe in our heart, is to a great degree,  accepted by words that people have said that we can't forget. Sometimes a good counselor can tease them out a little bit and say, so your father said  that, and you never forgot that, no, so that's in there.

So at one level, yes, if you want to guard your heart, take these words and put them in  there. But does it really make sense that, for example, that man who really needed a major redo  of his inner heart and was bitter against women and had such a view of himself, that if  he just memorized the scripture, for example, just took biblical principles, even relevant  ones, and just memorized them and thought about them that that would do it, no. No, you need a living word. You need a word of life, but let me tell you where you get it. You have to put the book of Proverbs into the context of the whole Bible, and here's  what you see.

In John chapter 539, Jesus talks to the scribes and Pharisees, and he says, you study the scriptures  diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life, okay? You read the words of the Torah because you think that they give you the words of life. And Jesus goes on for a second and indicates that they are right, but then explains why  they testify of me, he says. You're right. The Bible does have the words of life, but you have to understand what the Bible is all  about.

It's about me. In Proverbs chapter 8, there's this beautiful poetic chapter in which we see God and  wisdom creating the world together. And wisdom is speaking, wisdom is personified. And wisdom is saying, I was with God as he was creating the world, as he was creating  the human race, we did it together, and you read it, and you say beautiful, beautiful,  of course, as poetry. And it's a way of saying God created the world in wisdom.

Is it, was it only poetry? Because when you get to chapter 1 of the book of John, it says, in the beginning was the  word, listen carefully. And the word was with God, and the word was God. And then it says through him, all things were made without him, nothing was made that  has been made. Wait a minute, here again we have what?

The word, alongside of God, but the word is God, making all things with God. Here's what the Bible is claiming. And here's what Jesus actually claims. Jesus is the wisdom of God, because he is the living word. He's the word that if you grasp and you put in your heart will make you wise.

Now, I want you to think about this, it's actually just struck me this week. What is wisdom? It's not just knowledge, right? We say it's knowledge applied. Wisdom is knowledge brought down to earth, brought down to earth, brought down to  street level.

It's applied. We know lots of people who are knowledgeable that they're just not smart, or they're  smart, but they're not wise. Wisdom is knowledge brought down to earth. Who is Jesus? He is God expressed.

He is God embodied. He is God's wisdom. He is God literally brought down to earth. He is God brought into human form. Oh, we talk about the glory of God.

We talk about the holiness of God, the love of God, but those are abstractions. And if you just memorize this abstraction, it's not going to change your heart. It's not going to make you wise. It's not going to pull your heart off the things that you have given your heart to. But hit this will.

Jesus Christ is God, the wisdom of God. He is the wisdom. He is the living word. He is God. Come down to earth.

Look at him. John chapter three, John chapter four, and John chapter three, Nicodemus is a spiritual  seeker. Jesus is very abrupt with him. You must be born again. John four, the Samaritan woman is a spiritual seeker.

He's so patient. John chapter 11, Lazarus is dead. Man is dead. Two bereaved sisters, Mary and Martha. Martha comes up and says, Lord, if you had been here, my brother wouldn't have died.

Mary comes up and says, Lord, if you had been here, my brother wouldn't have died. Same situation, two women saying the same thing. In one case, Jesus gives Martha a lecture. I am the resurrection in the life. In the other case, he just weeps.

Why does he weep here and preach here? Why is he abrupt here? Why is he patient here? Because Jesus Christ does not have a temperament. Jesus is consummate wisdom.

He's supreme wisdom. And he is God's wisdom. He's all the stuff you read about. You hear about. But it's all an abstraction.

It's wisdom brought down to earth. It's the holiness of God embodied in a human being. And when you see him, and when you meditate on the glory of who he is, is he's walking  through the pages of the New Testament, now you've got something that will change your  heart. But particularly, an explanation to say, only if you see what he did for you on the cross. Why does Paul say that the Greeks and the Romans saw the cross as utter foolishness?

I'll tell you why. Because the Greeks and Romans said, if you have a wise Messiah, why would he get killed  like that? Fools get punished because they deserve punishment. Fools, you know, the rod for the back of fools, it's all through the book of Proverbs. Fools are always getting punished because they deserve it.

And because there's too stupid to avoid it. If you're wise, you don't go to the cross. You don't get scourged. You don't get beaten. You don't get imprisoned.

It's foolishness. No, but see, Jesus Christ is the wisdom of God. He's consummate wisdom. But at the end of his life, he took our place. He took the place of the fools.

He got the scourging that fools deserve. He got the death that we deserve. And if you see him dying for you, you'll love him. And that's what changes the heart. Look at this.

Love her, wisdom, cherish her, embrace her. It personifies wisdom and says, it's not enough for you just to try to study a bunch  of rules. You have to be so passionately in love with wisdom. Well, here's the way to get passionately in love with wisdom. Love him.

Embrace him. Cherish him. You can do all those things literally if you see him dying on the cross. Because if you see him dying on the cross for you, then as you meditate on the glory of  who he is in the page of the New Testament, his character will be burned into your heart. And you'll get your heart back because there will be nothing, no beautiful woman, no  great career, nothing will be as beautiful as him.

And you'll get your heart back. He's the living word. He's the living word. This is the way of wisdom. Let's pray.

Our Father, we ask that you would help us to see the... We can take this very, very literally. We can guard our heart because we love wisdom. We embrace wisdom. We pursue wisdom.

We cherish wisdom because it's Jesus. And Father, as we see him walking and acting and behaving and doing things in the Bible  in a wise way, but then seeing going to the cross, as we fall in love with him, then  his example becomes more than an example. It really becomes a living word brought into our hearts, reframing and reshaping us. Please, O Lord, make us wise the way Jesus is wise. We pray the name of Him in whom all the treasures of knowledge and wisdom are hidden.

Amen.

### 引言：智慧的必要性

欢迎来到福音不受欢迎播客。我们生活中面临的许多问题都很复杂，并不是简单地遵循规则就能解决的。我现在该发声还是等待？我应该接受那份工作还是留在原地？这就是为什么智慧如此重要。但我们如何培养智慧呢？今天请加入我们，听听 Tim Keller 如何探讨我们如何将上帝的智慧应用于我们生活中的日常复杂性。如果您收听今天的教导，我们邀请您访问 gospelunlife.com 并注册电子邮件更新。当您注册时，您将收到我们的季度期刊和其他有价值的以福音为中心的资源。今天就订阅 gospelunlife.com。

今天早上的经文来自箴言第 4 章第 5 至 9 节和第 14 至 27 节。

> 得智慧，得聪明，不可忘记，也不可偏离我口中的言语。不可离弃智慧，智慧就护卫你；要爱她，她就保守你。智慧为首，所以要得智慧。在你一切所得之内，必得聪明。高举她，她就使你高升；怀抱她，她就使你尊荣。她必将华冠加在你头上，把荣冕交给你。

**我们生活在一个选择的文化中。** 我知道这通常是一个广告口号，但这确实是真的。历史上大多数地方和大多数时候，你不能选择你要嫁的人。你决定而不是你的父母是一个相对较新的想法。当然，这只是个开始。我们可以自由地成为我们想成为的人，过我们想过的生活。做我们想做的事情，因为我们的文化是世界历史上最个人主义的文化，因此我们的地位、父母和社会位置并不决定我们能做什么。我们有选择，选择，这意味着什么？这意味着我们比以往任何时候都更需要智慧，因为智慧是做出明智选择的能力。仅仅是善良和正派是不够的。这里有两个职业你可以选择。它们都是道德上允许的。没有一个是有罪的。对它们中的任何一个都没有错。但如果你选择不明智，如果你选择了不适合你的那个，你可能会失去多年的生命，实际上，这可能是一场灾难。我们比以往任何时候都更需要智慧。

### 第一部分：荣耀的争战

#### 1. 追求智慧

我们已经进行了三周的研究，这是最后一周，我们一直在研究圣经中箴言书的早期章节。我们正在研究箴言书的主题。我们一直在研究智慧是什么。它是关于生活复杂现实的能力。我们一直在研究你如何发展智慧。今天我们正在研究这段著名的经文，我们学习到智慧生活的三个特征。如果你想过一种智慧的生活，那种生活将以三件事为特征。一个荣耀的争战，一个守护的心，一个活的道。让我们来看看。

首先，智慧的道路是我们智慧生活的道路，基本上可以被描述为一个荣耀的争战。这是我想到的五到九节。得智慧，得聪明。不可离弃智慧，虽然它会花费你所有的一切，得聪明，珍惜她，拥抱她，她就会给你一个花冠来装饰你的头，并给你一个荣耀的冠冕。

贯穿整个段落的词语都是传达勤奋努力和意志力的决心。出现四次的“得”这个词实际上是指购买，意味着昂贵的购买，所以这是牺牲的语言，此外它在第七节中直接说，它会花费你所有的一切，得智慧。第六节中的“不可离弃”字面意思是不要放手，要顽强，不屈不挠。所以有牺牲，有不屈不挠。注意这里的语言，这是追求一个女人结婚的隐喻。它说不要离弃她，爱她，珍惜她，拥抱她，她就会回应你，她就会尊重你，所以这是激情和追求的语言。

### 第二部分：守护的心

#### 1. 心的重要性

第二件事，一个智慧的生活不仅以荣耀的争战为特征，还以守护的心为特征。我们所说的守护的心是什么意思？这是第二件事。考虑到箴言书完全是关于智慧和获得智慧的，23 节非常惊人，因为它本质上是在说，如果你想变得聪明，没有什么比这更重要的了。最重要的是，23 节，守护你的心，因为一切你所做的都从中流出。

这不是现代对心的理解。我们相信心是情感的种子。我们认为思想来自头脑，情感来自心。现在我们生活在一个情感被优先考虑的时代。我们有大量的科幻小说。所有《星际迷航》电影和电视剧的元叙事之一是机器有理性。你知道，机器人和计算机有理性，但我们只有，我们有情感，这就是使我们成为人类的原因。使我们成为人类的不是理性，而是情感。这就是使我们不是机器，而是人类。

### 第三部分：活的道

#### 1. 圣经的角色

答案实际上就在第 20、21 和 22 节中，它告诉你律法的教师。现在，正在对年轻人或年轻人讲话的人正在阅读箴言书，贯穿整个箴言书，不断谈论，我要给你我的话语，你需要守护我的话语，你需要接受我的话语。那些话语是什么？是律法教师的话语，也就是上帝的律法？是圣经。事实上，所有智慧文学基本上都是将上帝的律法，伟大的律法原则，带到地上应用于日常生活，将上帝的律法，伟大的原则和戒律应用于日常生活。

**耶稣是上帝的智慧，因为他是活的道。** 他是如果你掌握并放在心中会使你变得聪明的道。现在，我想让你思考这个，这实际上只是本周让我震惊。智慧是什么？不仅仅是知识，对吧？我们说这是应用的知识。智慧是知识被带到地上，被带到地上，被带到街头层面。它是应用的。我们知道很多有知识的人，他们只是没有聪明，或者他们聪明，但他们不聪明。智慧是知识被带到地上。耶稣是谁？他是上帝的表达。他是上帝的体现。他是上帝的智慧。他是上帝字面上被带到地上。他是上帝被带入人形。

让我们祷告。

我们的父，我们请求你帮助我们看到... 我们可以非常非常字面地理解这一点。我们可以守护我们的心，因为我们爱智慧。我们拥抱智慧。我们追求智慧。我们珍惜智慧，因为它是耶稣。父，当我们看到他在圣经中行走、行动、表现和做事时是多么聪明，但然后看到他走向十字架，当我们爱上他时，他的榜样就不仅仅是一个榜样。它真的成为一个活的道进入我们的心，重新塑造和重塑我们。请，哦主，使我们像耶稣一样聪明。我们祈祷他的名，在他里面隐藏着所有知识和智慧的宝藏。阿门。

欢迎收听 Gospel in Life 播客。我们在人生中面对的许多问题都很复杂，并不是简单遵守一些规则就能解决的。我现在要不要开口说话？我要不要接受那份工作，还是留在原来的岗位？这就是为什么“智慧”至关重要。

那我们如何培养智慧呢？今天，让我们一同聆听提姆·凯勒，来看我们如何把神的智慧运用在日常生活的复杂处境中。如果你今天听完这篇讲道，欢迎访问 gospelonlife.com 订阅我们的邮件更新。订阅之后，你会定期收到我们的季刊，以及其他宝贵、以福音为中心的资源。现在就访问 gospelonlife.com 订阅吧。

今天的经文选自《箴言》第四章 5–9 节和 14–27 节：

“要得智慧，要得聪明，不可忘记，也不可偏离我口中的言语。
不可离弃智慧，智慧就护卫你；要爱她，她就保守你。
智慧为首，所以要得智慧，在你一切所得之内必得聪明。
高举智慧，她就使你高升；怀抱智慧，她就使你尊荣。
她必将华冠加在你头上，把荣冕交给你。”

“不要行恶人的路，不要走坏人的道。
要躲避，不可经过，要转身而去。
因为他们不得睡觉，若不行恶；不使人跌倒，睡卧不得安稳。
他们以奸恶为食物，以强暴为饮料。
但义人的路好像黎明的光，越照越明，直到日午。
恶人的道好像幽暗，不知因什么跌倒。
我儿，要留心听我的言词，侧耳听我的话语，
都不可离你的眼目，要存记在你心中。
因为得着它的就得了生命，又得了医全体的良药。
你要保守你心，胜过保守一切，因为一生的果效是由心发出。
你要除掉邪辟的口，弃绝乖谬的嘴。
你的眼目要向前正看，你的眼皮当向前直观。
要修平你脚下的路，坚定你一切的道。
不可偏向左右，要使你的脚离开邪恶。”

这是主的话。

我们活在一个“选择”的文化里。我知道这常常只是一句广告口号，但它其实是真的。在大多数地方、历史上的大多数时候，你不会自己选择要和谁结婚——由你自己而不是由你的父母来决定，这其实是一个相对较新的观念。但当然，这只是个开始。我们被告知，我们可以自由地成为我们想成为的人，按我们想要的方式去生活，做我们想做的事。因为我们的文化可能是历史上最个人主义的文化，我们所在的地方、父母的背景、社会阶层，并没有像过去那样强力决定我们能做什么。

我们有一个又一个的“选择”。这意味着什么？这意味着，我们从来没有像现在这样如此需要智慧，因为智慧就是“做出明智选择的能力”。光是“做一个好人”“做一个正派的人”还远远不够。你面前可能有两条职业道路可选，两条路在道德上都可以，彼此都不是罪，也不能说哪一条从本质上就是错的。但如果你选得不明智——选了一条与你这个人并不匹配的路，你可能会在那条路上浪费掉好多年，甚至酿成灾难。

我们从三周前就开始做一件事，而今天是第三讲、也是最后一讲：我们一直在看圣经中《箴言》前几章，来理解这卷书里关于“智慧”的一些主题。我们看过“什么是智慧”——智慧是对人生复杂现实的驾驭能力；我们也看过“如何长成有智慧的人”。今天，我们来到这段非常著名的经文，在这里我们看到，一个有智慧的人生会有三个特征。如果你想过一个有智慧的人生，这样的人生将会被这三个东西所表征：一场荣耀的争战、一颗受守护的心、一句话语的生命。我们一个个来看。

首先，智慧之路、智慧的人生，本质上可以被描述为“一场荣耀的争战”。我想到的是 5–9 节：

“要得智慧，要得聪明……不可离弃智慧……要爱她……要高举她……怀抱她，她就把荣冕交给你。”

这些话里面充满了各种表达“竭力、用心、意志坚定”的词。“要得”这个字在原文里其实是“买”的意思，而且是“付上代价去买”，也就是“牺牲”的语言。并且，第 7 节说得很清楚：“智慧为首，所以要得智慧，在你一切所得之内必得聪明。”——它会“花光你所有（代价）”。

第 6 节“不可离弃”原文有“不松手”的意思，要“咬紧不放”，是一种顽强、不放弃的姿态。所以这里既有“牺牲”，也有“坚定不移”。再注意，这里用的其实是一个追求女子、迎娶新娘的隐喻：不要离弃她，要爱她，要珍惜她，要拥抱她，她就回应你，她就尊荣你——这是“激情追求”的语言。

整段经文都在讲：这是一个意志的决心——你要把智慧放在你人生的最中心，要为此打仗、要为此争战。但这又是一场“荣耀的争战”，因为经文说，它的结局是“华冠”“荣冕”。其他一些我们今天没时间细看的经文也是这么描绘的。

你看第 18–19 节：“义人的路好像黎明的光，越照越明，直到日午。恶人的道好像幽暗，不知因什么跌倒。”对比在这里：为什么智慧值得你付这一切代价？因为随着时间推移，有智慧的人会越来越有平安，而不是越来越焦躁；会越来越清明，越来越看得懂人生，而不是越来越迷糊、越来越在黑暗里跌跌撞撞、事情总出错、却连自己为什么跌倒都不知道，只是越来越愤怒。

换句话说，智慧就像一顶“荣耀的冠冕”，值得你为它争战。但问题来了：为什么要打这么一场仗？为什么要这么拼？为什么这里说要“竭尽所有”去得智慧，要有这么强的意志？

不管你前两周有没有在场，我们都需要稍微回顾一下，因为这对我们很重要。答案有两个：第一，我们生来就是愚昧人。我们不是一块空白的黑板，然后再慢慢被填上“愚昧”或“智慧”。不，我们天生带着愚昧的倾向，因此追求智慧其实是在跟自己的本性打仗。

第二，因为圣经告诉我们，形成智慧的那些东西，都是一些长期的过程、长期的操练，需要你年复一年坚持下去。这就是为什么智慧总是一个“渐渐的”东西——第 18 节说，“义人的路好像黎明的光，越照越明，直到日午”。

还记得吗，《箴言》第三章说，“敬畏耶和华”是智慧的根基。你听到这里可能会问：“那是什么意思？”我们之前说过，“敬畏耶和华”就是与你的神有一个活泼、真实、经验性的关系——不是只是“相信祂存在”，而是祂的爱、祂的圣洁对你来说都是真的、是活的。这意味着什么？意味着你要有祷告的生活。

任何一个试过每天固定祷告三十分钟的人都知道，那有多难——要一直专注在神身上是多么不容易。

我们还说，智慧的另一个来源是“彼此督责、彼此劝勉”的群体。愚昧人的特点是什么？愚昧人“自以为是”，只在乎自己怎么看、自己怎么想。换句话说，愚昧就是“眼里只有自己”——“在我眼中对的，就一定是对的”。而有智慧的人则不断尝试用别人的眼光来看事情。所以，有智慧的人会让自己处在一个“谋士群体”中，有一群劝他、提醒他、给他意见的朋友——他不轻易单方面做重大决定，而是常常去听取、接受很多建议；他甘愿受监督。

举个例子：你有没有四五个可以信任的人，能够一起看你怎么花钱？你说：“这很私人的，不给别人看。”圣经会说，这种想法本身就是愚昧。因为如果没有别人的视角，你很自然地就会为自己的各种消费方式找借口，可能会把钱花得极不智慧。而当你在群体中、让别人也来“看见”你怎么用钱时，你就会慢慢变得更有智慧。可这很难啊。

最后一点：我们说过，许多人都听过那句话——“沉浸在神的话语中，就会变得有智慧”。我想大部分基督徒都会点头：读圣经会使人有智慧。但这是一个要用“许多年”去成就的事。以我自己为例，服侍这么多年，讲过、教过圣经可能两三千次——而有时候我仍然觉得，好像才刚刚开始真正“抓到”一些东西。换句话说，以前那些看不懂的经文，现在慢慢因着读过更多别的经文，开始有了轮廓、有了意义。

但是，你需要做的，不仅仅是掌握圣经的一些细节。不是说“啊，原来还有这一节经文，我从前不知道我应该这么做”。这种“突然发现新规矩”的情况，其实已经不那么常发生在我身上了。你真正需要的是一个更深、更整体的东西。

天主教哲学家阿利斯戴尔·麦金太尔在《德性之后》这本书里讲了一个很有意思的故事。想象你站在一个公交车站，一个你从来没见过的人走过来，对你说：“你知道吗，野鸭的拉丁名字是 histrionicus histrionicus histrionicus。”然后他就走了。

你要怎样才能“理解”刚才发生了什么？你得把它放进一个“故事”里。也许那个故事是个悲伤的故事：这个人可能精神有问题，那是个很悲伤的故事，但确实能解释发生了什么，对吧？你也可以把它放进一个有点好笑的故事里：也许他前几天在图书馆向一位图书馆员问过关于野鸭的书，借到了那本书；而今天他在公交站看见你，以为你就是那位图书馆员——你们的头发、身形之类的让他搞混了。那也是一个合理的故事。

麦金太尔还给了一个更“离谱”的可能性：也许这个人其实是一个特工，他把你认错成了自己的接头人，而刚才那句拉丁文就是接头暗号。虽然听起来很夸张，但理论上也不是不可能。麦金太尔的意思是：除非你能把这件事放进某个“故事”里，否则你根本不知道该怎么回应。

这个世界今天告诉我们的“故事”是什么？大致是这样的：也许有神，也许没有；也许有来世，也许没有——但无论是哪一种，你都不可能真正知道。所以，你只有今生；如果你要得到任何快乐与满足，都必须在此时此地抓住。这就是“世界的故事”。

而圣经给你的是另一个故事：神创造了世界，也创造了你，因此你拥有的一切都是礼物；祂将要更新这个世界，而如果你信靠祂，你会在那新世界里永远与祂同活。那意味着什么？意味着今生就像是一座豪宅的玄关，一切都还只是极微小的开端。

你会相信哪一个故事？你心里真正“住进”哪一个故事？你越是用心去接受、去咀嚼其中一个故事，它就越深地影响你生活中的一切。比如：你怎么用钱？你会奉献多少？如果你把自己的钱放进这个圣经的故事里，你对金钱的态度、使用方式会和把钱放在另一个世俗故事里截然不同。

所以，读圣经不仅是为了找到一些“原则”和“规条”——尽管圣经确实有很多宝贵的原则和命令。你要读它的叙事、诗歌、历史，要读全部；你越是与整本圣经打交道，你就越有智慧，它就会越来越深地影响你做的每一件事。即便在圣经没有给出明确指令的地方——比如圣经没有说“你必须奉献多少百分比”，但当圣经的故事深深活在你心里，它会极大地影响你每天如何用钱。

做一个有智慧的人，是一场争战。这需要许多年。但那是一场荣耀的争战。

第二点：有智慧的人生不仅是一场荣耀的争战，也是一颗“受守护的心”。什么叫“守护你的心”？这就是第二部分要说的。

考虑到《箴言》这卷书通篇都在讲“智慧”和“得智慧”，第 23 节的话其实非常惊人：“你要保守你心，胜过保守一切，因为一生的果效是由心发出。”换句话说，如果你想有智慧，这是最重要的事之一。

这和现代人对“心”的理解非常不同。我们今天通常认为“心”是情感的坐标——思想从“脑袋”来，感觉从“心”来。我们活在一个高度“重情感”的时代，我们的科幻作品、文化叙事常常在讲：机器有理性，机器人和电脑可以推理，但只有人类有“情感”。所以真正让我们成为人的，不是理性，而是情感——这就是现代文化的说法。

有趣的是，希腊人和罗马人恰好说相反：他们认为让我们有别于动物、成为“人”的是理性。但这又是另一个话题、另一篇讲道了。

重点是：不论古今，人类文化几乎总是在把“情感”和“理性”对立起来。可是圣经不是这样分的。你在圣经（甚至只看《箴言》）里会发现，圣经常常讲“心思”在心里、行为出于心——不仅是“感觉”。

第 23 节说的不是“心是情感的源头；情感从心里来，思想从脑里来”，而是说：“一切都从心里发出。”后面接着的经文也说明了：你的嘴说什么、眼睛看什么、身体做什么，都出自“心”。

为什么？因为圣经认为，“心”是你最根本的“承诺”“盼望”和“信靠”的所在。你的心里塞着一些最深层的信念——你认定只有拥有某些东西，你才能喜乐地接住人生。

每个人心里都有一个清单：如果我有了这个这个这个，我就能喜乐地接住人生；我的生命才有意义，我才是安全的，我才知道自己是有价值的。你“心里认定”必须拥有的那些东西，会驱动你的一切思维、情感和意志选择。

我试着用另一种方式说一遍：你心里真正信靠、安息、寄托盼望的那一位（或那些东西），就是在决定你怎么看、你感觉什么、你怎么做。你的心“选择”信什么，你的头脑就会去解释现实、使之看起来合理；你的情感就会去渴望那些东西、觉得它们美；你的意志就会采取行动、觉得这样做务实可行。因为“你一生的果效，是由心发出”。

若你从来不下到这一层，你就永远不了解自己。

多年前我辅导过两个年轻人，他们都是订婚之后被女方退婚——都是女方提出解约。他们彼此不认识，是两段完全不同的关系。我当时跟这两个年轻人都走得很近，他们当然都很受打击，都对前未婚妻有很深的愤怒。

但后来，两个人走出了完全不同的路。第一个男生，虽然很痛苦，但一点一点学会了饶恕，是真正很不容易地饶恕；他后来继续往前走，开始和其他女生约会，最后遇见并娶了一位姐妹，有了非常美好的婚姻。

另一个男生却始终过不去。他一直没有办法真正原谅那位退婚的女士，也始终无法信任任何女性。结果，他的苦毒渗透到了之后所有的关系里。

你可以想象吗？他接下来的每一段关系都被这种苦毒、这种怀疑毒害了——他不信任女人，假定女人大致都是那样；因此他在关系里充满猜忌、不安，他处理关系的方式极不智慧。于是一次又一次的关系破裂，他却持续把责任推给女人，而实际上问题在他自己身上。

这就像一个人星期二晚上喝伏特加兑苏打把自己灌醉；星期三喝波本兑苏打又灌醉；星期四喝龙舌兰兑苏打继续灌醉。有人问他：“你觉得每次把你灌醉的是什么？”他说：“显然是苏打水。”

你看，他完全没抓到问题的关键。

有人会说：“那他需要学会掌控情绪，需要‘情绪智商’——要学会重构自己的感受、在发怒时数到十、换个角度看事情。”这些当然有一定帮助，但还远远不够。问题更深——深入到“心”的层面。

这两位前未婚妻其实都非常漂亮——外表上都极有吸引力。第一个男生后来所娶的妻子，外表上反而没有那么“惊艳”，但对他来说已经没那么重要。而对第二个男生来说，“外表极其出众”却是极其重要的事——重要到成了偶像。

在他心里，他是这么说的：“只有当一个非常漂亮的女人愿意嫁给我，我才知道自己是个了不起的人——别的男人都会嫉妒我。”当你用这个标准来定义自我价值时，即便真进入婚姻，那婚姻也不会健康。但在当下，这种内在标准让他根本无法放手。他没有“守住自己的心”，而是把心交给了一个取代神的“救主”——好像拥有这样一个妻子，就能治愈他从前所有的伤。他其实不是把心给了那位姐妹，而是把心给了“我要一个完美漂亮的妻子”这个偶像。

除非你愿意下潜到这一层——你真正相信什么、真正指望什么、真正倚靠什么——否则你不会真正处理你的情绪。所以，圣经说：“你要保守你心。”

那问题来了：怎么守？这就牵出最后一个问题：我们要如何做？

你若只是浅浅地理解“保守你心”，可能会以为它在说：“要小心你的情绪。”但现在你看到，这远比情绪管理复杂得多。管理情绪有很多技巧：你可以压抑它们、可以通过呼吸练习平复自己、可以通过“重构”来调整——纽约时报那篇文章里讲的那个九岁男孩 Anthony 就是例子。他在学校做了一件丢脸的事，其他孩子都笑他，他就暴怒、打人。老师把他带去“情绪智能”的课程，让他学习如何调整自己的愤怒、如何给事情“换个框架”。老师问他：“你确定那些孩子是因为觉得你又笨又坏才笑你吗？会不会只是因为他们很紧张，不知道怎么办，就尴尬地笑出来？”Anthony 思考了一下，说：“我觉得你说得对，有些人可能是那样，但有些真的就是在取笑我。”

你看，老师没有办法往更深处去——没法跟他说：“即便他们真的是恶意地笑你，那又怎么样呢？这并不能决定你是谁。”因为老师没有这个“故事”。

圣经说，在“情绪管理”之下还有一层：那就是“守护你的心”。那要怎么做呢？答案就写在 20–22 节：

“我儿，要留心听我的言词，侧耳听我的话语，都不可离你的眼目，要存记在你心中；因为得着它的就得了生命，又得了医全体的良药。”

这位在《箴言》中讲话的“父亲”，其实就是“律法的教师”。整卷《箴言》中他不断对年轻人说：“要听我的话，要记住我的言语。”这些“话”是什么？就是神的律法——圣经的话。整卷《箴言》、乃至所有智慧文学，都是在把神律法的大原则“翻译”到日常生活中——把律法的精神落实在一件一件具体的事情上。

所以，他说：“要留心听我的话，要把它们存在心里。”注意，他说的不是“照着做”而已，他说：我的话就是“生命”，是“医全体的良药”。你把这些话存进心里，就能医治你整个生命。

从某个角度看，这很合逻辑：你心里那些最深的信念是怎么来的？你是怎样“决定”自己的人生意义要靠什么来证明？你是怎样得出“如果有一个漂亮女人嫁给我，我就是个有价值的人”这样的结论？答案一定涉及“话语”：你自己的思考、别人对你说的话、你从文化和环境里听来的东西——这些话最后变成了你心里的“故事”。

因此，如果你想守住你的心，你也需要“话语”。但这并不是说：“只要背诵很多圣经经文就够了。”你可以背很多合适的经文，却仍然不改变。

你需要的不是死文字，而是“活的话语”。你需要一位“活着的道（Word）”。

在约翰福音 5:39，耶稣对法利赛人说：“你们查考圣经，因你们以为内中有永生。”——也就是说，你们读经，是因为你们相信圣经里有“生命的话语”。耶稣并没有否认这一点；祂说，他们是对的，但他们没有看到圣经真正指向的是谁：“这经就是为我作见证的。”也就是说，圣经确实有“生命之道”，但你必须看见整本圣经都在指向祂。

《箴言》第八章有一段极美的诗歌，智慧被人格化，说自己从起初就与神同在，与神一起创造世界、创造人类。我们读到那里的时候，会说：“真美，是一种诗意的表达，意思是神用智慧创造万物。”那当然没错。但到了约翰福音第一章，你会读到这样一句话：“太初有道，道与神同在，道就是神……万物是藉着他造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是藉着他造的。”这里再一次有一位与神同在、又就是神的“道（Word）”，与神一起创造万有。

圣经在宣称什么？它在宣称：耶稣就是神的智慧，耶稣就是那位“从太初与神同在的道”。祂是那位“活的道”，是那句真正有生命的大能话语。

我们刚才说过，什么是“智慧”？智慧不是光有知识；是把知识带到地上、带进街道、带进生活；是把抽象原则运用到复杂处境中。我们知道，很多知识分子并不“聪明”；很多聪明人也不一定“有智慧”。智慧是“把知识带到地上”。

那耶稣是谁？祂是神的智慧“落地成肉身”。祂是神的荣耀、圣洁、慈爱，从抽象的概念变成具体的人。光讲“神是荣耀的、圣洁的、慈爱的”这些抽象概念，很少能真正改变你的心；你只是背下一串神学形容词而已。但当你在福音书里看见耶稣——看见祂如何对待不同的人、如何处理冲突、如何伸张怜悯、又如何面对十字架——那就不再是抽象的“属性”，而是一个活生生的人；那才会真正触动你的心。

你读约翰福音第三章，尼哥底母是一个属灵的追寻者，耶稣对他非常直接：“你必须重生。”到了第四章，井边的撒玛利亚妇人也是属灵的追寻者，耶稣对她却极其温柔、有耐心。同样地，在约翰福音第 11 章，拉撒路死了，玛大和马利亚这两姐妹都对耶稣说同样一句话：“主啊，你若早在这里，我兄弟就不会死。”但耶稣对她们的反应完全不同：对玛大，祂讲了一段神学：“复活在我，生命也在我”；对马利亚，祂只是与她一同哭泣。

为什么这里讲道理、那里流眼泪？为什么这里看起来这么严厉，那里又这么温柔？因为耶稣没有被某一种“性格气质”所限制。祂不是一个“只会这样反应”的人。祂是完美的智慧，是智慧的化身——祂总是在每个具体情境中做最合宜的事。

祂就是《箴言》中所说的“智慧”本人，是神的智慧成了肉身，是那位“活的道”。当你在圣经里看见祂、注视祂，把祂的美善、智慧、柔和、刚强反复默想在心，你的心就会开始被改写。

但尤其重要的是：你要看见祂在十字架上为你所做的事。保罗说，希腊人和罗马人看十字架是“愚拙”。为什么？因为在他们看来：如果有一位“智慧的弥赛亚”，祂怎么会被这样羞辱地处死？在他们的观念里，愚昧人因自己的愚蠢而受罚；《箴言》中不断出现“鞭打是为愚昧人的背”——愚昧人总是在受惩罚，因为他们该受，也因为他们愚蠢到不会躲避后果。如果你真有智慧，你就不会走到被鞭打、被钉十字架那一步。

但福音告诉我们，耶稣基督本身就是神的智慧，是完美的智慧；然而在生命尽头，祂却站在愚昧人的位置上。祂承受了愚昧人该受的鞭伤和刑罚，承担了我们该承担的死亡。你若看见祂是为你而这样做，你就会爱祂，而爱才是改变人心最深的动力。

你再回来看这段经文里对“智慧”的描述：“要爱她，要珍惜她，要拥抱她。”智慧被人格化，好像一个你深深爱慕的人——经文在说：光是“知道一些原则”远远不够，你必须“爱上智慧”，把智慧放在你感情的中心。

那怎么办呢？答案就是：爱祂。拥抱祂，珍惜祂。你若看见这位为你钉十字架的耶稣，你就能这样做。

当你在福音书中注视祂的荣美、祂的十字架，你的心就会一点一点把那些本来抓住它的东西放开——不再把某个女人、某份事业、某种成功当作终极拯救者，因为再没有什么比祂更美、更值得你把整颗心交托。你会“拿回你的心”，把它真正交在祂手里。

祂就是那位“活着的道”，是神的智慧成了肉身。这才是真正的智慧之路。

我们一起祷告：

父啊，我们求你帮助我们，看见这段经文在说什么——我们可以真真实实地“保守我们的心”，因为我们爱智慧、拥抱智慧、竭力追求智慧；而那位智慧就是你的儿子耶稣。求你让我们在圣经里不断看见祂的荣耀，看见祂如何行事为人，看见祂如何为我们被钉十字架。愿我们越爱祂，祂的形象就越深地烙印在我们心里，重写我们的内在故事。

这样，我们的心就会被守住，不再被别的东西夺走。求你使我们在祂里面长成有智慧的人，因为一切智慧和知识的宝藏都藏在祂里面。奉祂的名祷告，阿们。

今天的经文选自《箴言》第四章 5–9 节和 14–27 节：

“要得智慧，要得聪明，不可忘记，也不可偏离我口中的言语。
不可离弃智慧，智慧就护卫你；要爱她，她就保守你。
智慧为首，所以要得智慧，在你一切所得之内必得聪明。
高举智慧，她就使你高升；怀抱智慧，她就使你尊荣。
她必将华冠加在你头上，把荣冕交给你。”

“不要行恶人的路，不要走坏人的道。
要躲避，不可经过，要转身而去。
因为他们不得睡觉，若不行恶；不使人跌倒，睡卧不得安稳。
他们以奸恶为食物，以强暴为饮料。
但义人的路好像黎明的光，越照越明，直到日午。
恶人的道好像幽暗，不知因什么跌倒。
我儿，要留心听我的言词，侧耳听我的话语，
都不可离你的眼目，要存记在你心中。
因为得着它的就得了生命，又得了医全体的良药。
你要保守你心，胜过保守一切，因为一生的果效是由心发出。
你要除掉邪辟的口，弃绝乖谬的嘴。
你的眼目要向前正看，你的眼皮当向前直观。
要修平你脚下的路，坚定你一切的道。
不可偏向左右，要使你的脚……

远离邪恶。”这是主的话。

我们活在一个“选择”的文化里。我知道这常常只是一句广告口号，但它其实是真的。在大多数地方、历史上的大多数时候，你不会自己选择要和谁结婚——由你自己而不是由你的父母来决定，这其实是一个相对较新的观念。但当然，这只是个开始。

我们被告知，我们可以自由地成为我们想成为的人，按我们想要的方式去生活，做我们想做的事。因为我们的文化可能是历史上最个人主义的文化，我们所在的地方、父母的背景、社会阶层，并没有像过去那样强力决定我们能做什么。

我们有一个又一个的“选择”。这意味着什么？这意味着，我们从来没有像现在这样如此需要智慧，因为智慧就是“做出明智选择的能力”。光是“做一个好人”“做一个正派的人”还远远不够。你面前可能有两条职业道路可选，两条路在道德上都可以，彼此都不是罪，也不能说哪一条从本质上就是错的。但如果你选得不明智——选了一条与你这个人并不匹配的路，你可能会在那条路上浪费掉好多年，甚至酿成灾难。

我们从三周前就开始做一件事，而今天是第三讲、也是最后一讲：我们一直在看圣经中《箴言》前几章，来理解这卷书里关于“智慧”的一些主题。我们看过“什么是智慧”——智慧是对人生复杂现实的驾驭能力；我们也看过“如何长成有智慧的人”。

今天，我们来到这段非常著名的经文，在这里我们看到，一个有智慧的人生会有三个特征。如果你想过一个有智慧的人生，这样的人生将会被这三个东西所表征：一场荣耀的争战、一颗受守护的心、一句话语的生命。我们一个个来看。

首先，智慧之路、智慧的人生，本质上可以被描述为“一场荣耀的争战”。我想到的是 5–9 节：“要得智慧，要得聪明……不可离弃智慧……要爱她……要高举她……怀抱她，她就把荣冕交给你。”

这段经文通篇都用各种词语来表达“竭力追求、全心投入、意志坚定”。“要得”这个字在原文里其实是“买”的意思，而且是“付出高价去买”，这是“牺牲”的语言。并且经文直说：“智慧为首，所以要得智慧，在你一切所得之内必得聪明。”——也就是说，为了得智慧，你要愿意付上你所拥有的一切。

第 6 节“不可离弃”原文有“不松手”的意思，要紧紧抓住、不肯放手，是一种顽强、不放弃的姿态。这里既有“牺牲”，也有“持之以恒”。

还要注意，经文用的是一个追求女子、迎娶新娘的比喻：不要离弃她，要爱她，要珍惜她，要拥抱她，她就回应你、尊荣你——这是“热烈追求”的语言。

整段经文都在讲：你要立定意志，在人生中心为智慧打这一场仗。但这是一场“荣耀的争战”，因为经文说，它的结果是“华冠”“荣冕”。

整段经文用了很多词，来表达“勤奋用力”和“意志坚定”。“要得”这个词在原文里其实就是“买”的意思，而且是“付出高价去买”，是一种“牺牲”的语言。第 7 节说得更直白：“在你一切所得之内必得聪明”——也就是“要付上你所有的代价去得智慧”。第 6 节“不可离弃”原文就是“不要松手”，要咬住不放，是一种顽强、不懈的坚持。所以这里既有牺牲，也有持久不懈。

还要注意，经文使用的是一个追求女子、迎娶新娘的比喻。它说：“不要离弃她，要爱她，要珍惜她，要拥抱她，她就尊荣你。”——这是激情与追求的语言。

所以整段话在讲的是：这是一个意志的抉择，是你必须为之争战、把它守在生命中心的事。但这是一场荣耀的争战，因为经文说，结局是一顶荣耀的冠冕。还有一些其他经文（我们今天没有时间一一展开）也是这样描绘的。慢慢地、渐渐地——你看 18–19 节：“义人的路好像黎明的光，越照越明，直到日午；恶人的道好像幽暗，不知因什么跌倒。”

对比非常清楚：为什么智慧值得？因为随着时间推移，有智慧的人会越来越有平安，而不是越来越焦躁不安；会越来越清楚、越来越明白许多原本不懂的事，而不是越来越陷在黑暗里，各种事情不断出错、你一直在跌倒，却连自己为什么跌倒都不知道，只是越来越愤怒。

所以智慧就像一顶荣耀的冠冕，值得你为之争战。

但问题来了：为什么会是一场“争战”？为什么需要这么大的努力？为什么经文要说“要得智慧，要付上一切代价”？为什么需要这么大的意志力度？

无论你前两周有没有来听，这时候复习一下都很好。答案是：首先，因为我们生来就是愚昧人。我们不是一块空白的黑板，然后再被后天填满愚昧或智慧；不，我们一出生就带着愚昧的倾向，因此，在追求智慧时，我们是在和自己的本性打仗。

其次，因为要长成智慧人，圣经所教给我们的那些基本功，都是长期的过程、长期的操练，需要我们在许多年里坚持下去。

（凯勒对现场的一位拍照者说）：
“抱歉，先生，那个相机一直闪灯真的让我很难集中精神，请原谅，我并不是想让任何人难堪，而且我讲道这么多年，从来没有这样开口过，但刚才真的有点难以专心。我很高兴你在这里，只是你知道吗，很多年前，我太太会说：‘那时候你肯定什么都不会说，做一个愚昧人就算了。’但现在我好像比从前有点智慧了，我找到一个方式既能把话说出来，又不伤害你——你没问题，我也没问题，好吗？好，我们继续。”

我们说两个原因。第一个刚讲过了：我们生来就是愚昧人。第二个原因是，如果你两周前在这里，你会记得：我们每个人都有“气质”。你或许做过一些“气质测验”——比如 MBTI 之类的：有的人偏内向，有的人偏外向；有的人比较直觉，有的人比较理性分析；有的人喜欢尽快“定论”，有的人更喜欢“过程”。

还记得我们提过一项跨越三十多个文化的研究吗？研究发现，人类在“面临问题”时，神经系统大致有三种基本倾向：有的人本能是“退后”；有的人本能是“冲上去”；还有的人本能是“先停住、观察再说”。

心理学家指出：我们这些内向的、外向的、理性型的、直觉型的、喜欢结论的、喜欢过程的……我们习惯性地、条件反射式地用某一种方式回应处境——可能是因为天生的 wiring，也可能是成长环境、文化教给我们的。但问题是：在我们所遭遇的所有情境当中，只有极少一部分场景，恰好适合我们那个“本能反应”。

该后退的时候，你却本能地往前冲；该直面的时候，你却一味退缩；该立刻行动的时候，你却站在那里观望——结果可能会是“送命”。

我们每个人都带着这样那样的“气质”，你也许会说：“那气质有什么不好？人人都有自己的气质啊。”是的，这正是我们“全都带着愚昧”的原因之一。因为这个世界本身并没有一个“配合你气质”的性格模板——世界不是为你的性格量身打造的。如果这个世界刚好完全贴合你的气质，那么你那种内向式的、外向式的、“先说再说”式的、“先听再说”式的、“赶紧下结论”式的、“慢慢来观察”式的反应，每一次都会是最智慧、最合适的反应——那你当然就是完完全全的智慧人了。但事实上，没有人的个人气质能完美贴合真实世界。

因此，我们都天然带着愚昧。要成为智慧人，就意味着你必须对“现实”足够敏感，以至于你能在某些时候跳出你一贯的、天生的、文化灌输给你的反应模式，拥有比你本能更宽广的“反应区间”，能在需要时违背你的本性，做出合宜的选择。这非常困难。

这就是为什么“做一个有智慧的人”总是一场争战：你要不断和自己习惯的做事方式对着干。

如果这个世界本身有一种“固定气质”，而你的气质刚好完美契合这个世界——无论是内向的还是外向的，是喜欢先说的还是喜欢先听的，是急于下结论的还是偏爱慢慢来、看着办的——那你自然就会在每个情境中都反应得恰到好处，那你当然就是完全有智慧的人了。

但事实是，我们当中没有一个人是这样的。因此，我们天生都是愚昧人。要成为智慧人，就意味着你要对真实世界如此敏锐，以至于你可以超越你“与生俱来”的反应模式——超越你从文化、家庭、心理、神经系统那里得到的那些惯性——在需要的时候违背本能，按智慧行事。这非常非常难。

这就是为什么“做一个有智慧的人”总是一场争战：你要不断和自己习惯的做事方式对着干。但如果你真的在成长、越来越有智慧，你就会开始对自己说：“我一点也不喜欢用那种方式做事，我天性也不那样；但现在这个处境需要那样做，所以我还是要那样做。”

另一条让这条路变成“争战”的原因，是我们在查考《箴言》（尤其第三章）时看见的：圣经所说那些能培养智慧的事，都是一些“过程”、一些“操练”，必须年复一年坚持下去。所以，智慧总是“渐渐”长成的——“义人的路好像黎明的光，越照越明，直到日午”。

《箴言》第三章说，智慧的根基之一是“敬畏耶和华”。你可能会问：“那是什么意思？”我们说过，“敬畏耶和华”就是与你的神有一个活生生的、存在层面的关系——不是只在概念上“相信有神”，而是祂的爱和祂的圣洁对你来说都是又真又活的。这意味着，你有祷告的生活。

任何一个说“我要每天祷告三十分钟”的人都很快会发现，这件事有多难。要把心思持续地放在神身上，是极不容易的事。

我们还说，智慧来自“彼此督责、彼此劝勉”的群体。愚昧人的一个特点是“自以为是”——“愚昧人看自己为有智慧”。换句话说，愚昧人就是只在乎自己怎么想、自己怎么看的人。我的眼光是唯一重要的，我看到的就是真相。

而有智慧的人，总是在努力用别人的眼睛来看世界。因此，有智慧的人一定会有一群“谋士”——一群可以给她 / 他意见、提醒、纠正的朋友。有智慧的人很少为重大事情单打独斗，而是常常去寻求、听取、接受许多建议；他们愿意把自己置于监督之下。

智慧总是在尝试“用别人的眼睛看事情”。所以，有智慧的人会有一群谋士、一群顾问和朋友——他做决定时不是一个人拍板，而是常常去寻求许多建议，并且愿意听进去、愿意被劝勉；他让自己处在可被问责的位置上。

举个例子：你有没有四五个值得信任的人，可以一起看你怎么用钱？你可能会说：“那是我的私事啊。”圣经会说，这样想本身就是愚昧。如果完全没有别人的视角，你当然会不断为自己的消费方式找理由，你可能会在用钱上非常不智慧。若你在一个群体中、在别人面前“敞开”你的金钱使用，你反而会变得更有智慧。可这很难。

最后还有一点我们提过：很多人都听过这样一句话——“浸泡在神的话语中，就会变得有智慧。”我想大部分基督徒都会点头说：读圣经会使人有智慧。但这是一件需要“许多年”的事。

以我自己为例，这么多年下来，我大概听过、讲过两三千篇关于圣经的讲道。有时候我仍然觉得，好像才刚刚开始真正抓到一些东西。换句话说，那些从前看不懂的经文，现在因为看了足够多别的经文，渐渐变得清晰、有了脉络。

然而，你需要的并不只是掌握圣经的细节。不是说：“啊，我找到一节经文，原来我还应该做这件事。”这种“突然发现一条新命令”的情况，现在对我来说已经不那么常见了。你真正需要的是一个更深的操练。

天主教哲学家阿利斯戴尔·麦金太尔在《德性之后》这本书里讲了一个很有趣的比喻。假设你站在公交车站，一个你从来没见过的人走过来，对你说：“你知道吗，野鸭的拉丁名字是 histrionicus histrionicus histrionicus。”然后他就走开了。

那你要如何理解这种场景呢？总得有个解释吧。麦金太尔说，你唯一能理解它的方式，就是把它放进一个“故事”里。

也许那是一个让人难过的故事：你会想，可能他有精神疾病——那会是个悲伤的故事，但确实能解释刚才发生的事，对吧？

也可能是个比较好笑的故事：也许几天前，他在图书馆向一位图书馆员要了一本关于野鸭的书，后来他在公交站看到你，觉得你长得有点像那位图书馆员——可能是因为你的头发（或你没头发）之类的地方长得很像，于是他就以为你就是那位图书馆员。这是个好笑的故事，但同样能解释发生了什么。

麦金太尔还提出第三种可能：也许这个人其实是个特工，他把你错认成自己的接头人，而刚才那句拉丁文就是接头暗号。这听起来有点夸张，但理论上并不是不可能。

他的结论是：除非你能在某个故事的光照下去理解这件事，否则你根本不知道该如何回应。

我们所处的世界在讲给我们听的“故事”是这样的：也许有神，也许没有；没人能知道。也许有来世，也许没有；同样没人能确定。所以，如果你想在生命中有任何快乐，你必须在“此时此地”抓住它——你只有今生。这就是世界的故事。

圣经则告诉我们另一个故事：神创造了世界，也创造了你，因此你拥有的一切都是礼物。祂要更新这个世界，如果你信靠祂，你会在那更新后的世界里永远与祂同在。这意味着什么？意味着今生就像是一座豪宅的门厅，你整个人生其实只是在门厅里迈出的几个小小步伐而已。

你会相信哪一个故事？你心里真正让哪一个故事“住进去”？你越是用心地相信其中一个故事，把它放进心里，它就越会影响你生命中的一切。

比如，你怎么用钱？你会奉献多少？如果你把自己的钱放进这个圣经的故事里，你的用钱方式会和把钱放进那个世俗故事里完全不同。

所以，读圣经不只是为了从里面抽出一些原则和规条——尽管圣经里确实有很多宝贵的原则和命令。你要读圣经中的各个部分：叙事、诗歌、历史等等。你越多这样做，越熟悉整本圣经，你就会越有智慧，圣经就会越深地影响你做的每一件事。

即便在圣经没有直接给出“具体数字”的地方——比如圣经不会告诉你“你必须奉献多少百分比”——圣经所讲的那个大故事，仍然会极大地影响你每天怎样用钱。

所以，做一个有智慧的人是一场争战。这需要许多年的时间，但那是一场荣耀的争战。

第二，大有智慧的人生不单是一场荣耀的争战，也是一颗“受守护的心”。什么叫“守护的心”？这是我们要讲的第二点。

考虑到整卷《箴言》都是在谈“智慧”和“得智慧”，第 23 节这句话其实非常惊人，它等于在说：“如果你要有智慧，这件事是最重要的之一。”——“你要保守你心，胜过保守一切，因为一生的果效是由心发出。”

这和现代人对“心”的理解非常不同。我们一般认为“心”是情感的中心，思想从“头脑”来，感觉从“心”来。我们活在一个高度重视情感的时代，有大量科幻作品都在讲同一件事：机器拥有理性——机器人和电脑会推理——而我们人类拥有情感，这才是我们“为人”的根本。所以，很多人会说，让我们成为人的，不是理性，而是情感；情感让我们不是机器，而是人。

有趣的是，古希腊人和罗马人恰恰说的是相反的话：他们认为让我们有别于动物、成为人的，是理性。但那又是另一个故事、另一篇讲道了。

重点是，无论古今，人们总喜欢把“情感”和“理性”对立起来。

古希腊人、罗马人以及现代人，都习惯把“情感”和“理性”对立起来。

现在，让我们回到今天信息的后半段，由提姆·凯勒继续讲解。

我们今天常常说：拥有、表达并善用你的感受，对自己的感受诚实，这才是一个“真实而整合”的人该有的样子。两周前，《纽约时报》周刊有一篇文章，标题是《情绪智商可以在学校被教出来吗？》。在我们的文化里，虽然已经几乎没有圣经所讲的那个“智慧”概念，但有一个非常接近的概念——“情绪智商（emotional intelligence）”。

那篇文章说，“情绪智商”比学业成绩更能预测一个人的人生成就。所谓“情绪智商”，指的是：能认识自己的情绪，并能管理自己的情绪。

那篇文章说，“情绪智商”比学业成绩更能预测一个人的人生成就。所谓“情绪智商”，是指一个人认识自己情绪的能力，以及管理自己情绪的能力。

换句话说，重点在于：你要能管理你的情绪，要懂得“重构”你的情绪，让它们不至于失控，同时又愿意诚实面对自己的感受——而这一整套能力，被视为“智慧”。

我必须说，如果你读《箴言》，你就能理解为什么研究会发现：能够理解并掌控自己情绪的人，人生的整体状况通常比那些做不到的人要好——因为圣经中的“智慧”确实包含这一部分。但这不是最重要的部分。因为，信不信由你，当你以为自己已经“深入到一个人的情绪层面”，觉得：“啊，我终于碰触到他的真实感受了，现在我已经触及他这个人最深的地方了”，圣经会说：还没有。

看看这里的经文，再看看后面几节经文：它说，“要保守你心，因为一生的果效是由心发出。”你若通读整本圣经，甚至只看《箴言》，你会不断看到这样的说法：人是“用心思想”“用心行事”的——不仅仅是“用心感觉”。

经文没有说，“心是情绪的源头，情绪从心而来，而脑子负责思想”。它说的是：“一生的果效是由心发出。”后面的经文进一步指出：你的口里说什么、眼睛看什么、身体做什么，都是从心里流出来的。

为什么？因为圣经认为，“心”其实是你最根本的“承诺”、最深的“盼望”和“信靠”之所在。让我小心一点地说，我会说两遍，好让这句话真正进到你里面：

“心”是你“存放那些信念”的地方——那些关于“我必须拥有什么，才能喜乐地接住人生”的信念。

人人都相信自己“必须”拥有一些东西，才有办法喜乐地接纳人生。只要我有了那个，我就可以喜乐地活着；我的生命就有意义；我就安全；我就知道自己是有价值的。每个人心里都有一份“清单”：只要我拥有这些，我就能喜乐地接住人生。

而你的“心”对这些东西作出的选择，会决定你一切的所思所想。

你“心里选择”去相信什么，就会决定你其余的一切。

你心里若选择了某样东西，头脑就会去解释现实，使这选择看起来合理；情感就会去渴望它、觉得它美好；意志就会去追求它、觉得这样做很实际。换句话说，你的心认定“必须拥有什么才能喜乐地接住人生”，你心里真正安息、真正信靠、真正盼望的那个对象，会设定你的思想、意志和情绪——决定你看到什么、你对所看到的有何感受，以及你对所看到的会做什么。

因为“一生的果效是由心发出”。若你不肯下潜到这一层，你就永远不了解你自己。

我记得多年前有两个年轻人，他们都已经订婚，后来都是女方提出解约，把婚约退了——两段关系互不相干，两位姐妹也互不认识。我当时都陪在这两个弟兄身边，他们当然都受了很重的打击，也都对前未婚妻非常愤怒。

但后来，他们走出了完全不同的路。第一位弟兄，很不容易地学会了饶恕——那是一个艰难的过程，但他真的饶恕了那位退婚的姐妹。之后他继续往前走，开始和其他姐妹约会，最终遇见了一位现在的妻子，有一段非常美好的婚姻。

第二位弟兄却一直走不过去。他始终无法真正原谅那位退婚的姐妹，也渐渐无法信任任何女性。结果，他的苦毒渗透进他之后所有的关系里。

你可以想象：因为他不肯饶恕那件事，他对所有女人都抱持不信任态度，假定她们都“差不多是那样的人”；因此他在关系中总是带着怀疑、防备，处理感情的方式极不智慧。跟一个又一个姐妹交往，最后都是关系破裂——他把责任都推到女人身上，但实际上问题在他自己。

这就像一个人：星期二晚上喝伏特加兑苏打把自己灌醉，星期三喝波本兑苏打又灌醉，星期四喝龙舌兰兑苏打继续灌醉。有人问他：“你觉得每次把你灌醉的是什么？”他说：“显然是苏打水。”

你看，他完全没有抓到真正的问题。

有人可能会说：“他需要学会控制情绪，需要提高情绪智商——要学会重构自己的感受，在发怒时数到十，换个角度看待那件事。”这些固然有些帮助，但还远远不够。

有人会说：“你要学会控制情绪，要数到十，要想着：也许那位女士其实怎样怎样……”——但这里的问题远不止这些。

那两位退婚的姐妹，都是非常漂亮的姐妹——在外表上都很出众。后来，第一位弟兄所娶的妻子，在外表上其实并没有前一位那么耀眼，但这对他来说已经不再是最重要的事。对第二位弟兄而言，这却成了极其重要的事。

因为在他心里深处，他其实是这样对自己说的：“我要怎样才知道自己真的是个了不起的人？答案是——当我有一个非常漂亮的妻子，一个让别的男人都嫉妒的妻子。”

如果你用这样的标准来定义自己，婚姻本身就注定会非常困难，但在这里我要强调的是另一个事实：他根本无法喜乐地接住人生，除非他拥有一个“极其漂亮、让所有人羡慕的妻子”。而他并不觉得这有什么不对——这就是“他失去了自己的心”。他没有守住自己的心。

严格来说，他也不是把心“失给了”那个姐妹；他把心交给了一个自己塑造出来的“救主形象”：一个能让他觉得“人生总算圆满”的幻想。他对那位漂亮妻子的渴望，已经被他放在了“挽救他整个生命”的位置上。

如果你熟悉《创世记》中雅各的故事，你会发现他对拉结做了类似的事：好像只要像拉结这样的女人肯嫁给他，他人生中其他一切苦毒都能被医治一样。

除非你愿意下潜到那一层——审视你真正的信念、承诺、盼望和信靠——否则你在面对情绪时，会始终无能为力。所以，圣经说：“你要保守你心。”

这就带出最后一个问题：那我们要怎么做呢？

你看，“保守你心”绝不仅仅是“注意你的情绪”这么简单。表面上看，你可以用很多方式来管理情绪：你可以把情绪硬压下去；可以学习呼吸放松的技巧；可以像纽约时报文章里说的那样“重构”你的感受。

文章中讲到一个叫安东尼的小男孩，九岁，他在学校做了一件蠢事，全班同学都笑他，他就气得大打出手，于是被带去上“情绪智商课”。

在那里，老师们试着帮助安东尼学习控制愤怒——当他开始生气时，要学会对自己说一些话，同时也要学会“换个角度看事情”。什么叫“换个角度”？老师对他说：“你确定同学们笑你，是因为他们真的觉得你又笨又坏吗？有没有可能，他们其实是紧张、不知道该做什么，所以才尴尬地笑出来？”

安东尼想了想，说：“我觉得你对有些人说得可能是对的，但有些人真的就是在笑我。”

你看，老师已经没办法继续往更深的层面带他了。老师没法接着说：“好，那就算他们真的是故意嘲笑你，那又怎样呢？”——因为老师没有那个更深的“故事”，也没有更深的资源，只能不断尝试说服他：“其实他们不是在恶意对你，只是笨拙、不知所措而已。”但安东尼心里一直坚持：“不，他们就是在恶意地笑我。”然后老师就不知道还能说什么。

圣经却说，在“控制情绪”之下，还有一层更深的事，那就是“保守你的心”。那要怎么做呢？

答案其实就在 20–22 节里。这位在《箴言》中对“儿子”说话的人，就是“律法的教师”。他在整卷书中不断地说：“我要把我的话告诉你，你要守住我的话，要把我的话存起来。”这些“话”是什么？是律法教师的话，是神律法的话，也就是“圣经的话”。

事实上，整卷《箴言》，乃至所有的“智慧书”，基本上都是在做一件事：把神律法的伟大原则“带到地上”，带到日常生活的层面上来，把律法的原则和诫命应用在你每天的处境中。

所以，他这样说：“我儿，要留心听我的言词，侧耳听我的话语；都不可离你的眼目，要存记在你心中……”

“都不可离你的眼目，要存记在你心中；因为得着它的就得了生命，又得了医全体的良药。得着它的就得了生命，又得了医全体的良药。”

这很耐人寻味。你若要“保守你的心”，他却说：“把我的话放进去。”而他这里所说的，不只是某个普通人的话，而是“律法”的话——神话语的话。他在说：“把我要教给你的这‘圣经的话’，放进你的心里。”

注意，他在这里的宣称有多强烈：他不只是说“照着做”；他是说：“我给你的这些话本身就是生命。”你把这些话存进心里，它们就会守护你的心。

从某个角度看，这非常有道理。你想想看：你心里的那些“最深信念”是怎么来的？你是怎么得出“只要有一个漂亮女人爱我，我就好了”的结论？你是怎么得出“只要我事业成功、赚很多钱，我才有办法喜乐地活着”的结论？

你可以看到，两个人在同一个行业、走在同一条职业道路上，一个人拼命工作到快要累死，另一个人却相对轻松——为什么？因为第一个人心里深处在说：“除非我事业极为成功、赚到很多钱，不然我就无法喜乐地接住人生。”那他的心是怎么走到这一步的？一定是透过“话语”。可能是通过自己的思考，也可能是别人对他讲的话，或者是他从环境中听来的声音。这些话语，还有他对所遭遇事件的诠释，慢慢累积成了他的信念。

所以，当有人说：“棍棒可以打断我的骨头，但言语不能伤害我。”我们都知道这不是真的。我们对自己的想象、自我形象，以及我们在心里真正相信的很多东西，很大程度上都来自别人对我们说过、而我们至今忘不掉的话。有时候，一个好的辅导会帮你一点点梳理出来，让你说出：“哦，原来是我父亲当年对我说的那句话，我从来没忘记。”那句话一直在里面。

从这个层面说，是的，你若要保守你的心，就需要把“这些话”放进去。

但问题来了：仅仅如此真的够吗？那位在心里需要经历“重建”的弟兄——那个苦毒到几乎无法再有健康关系的男人——难道只要背一些合适的圣经经文就够了吗？只要把与他处境有关的原则背下来、想一想，就能够完全改变吗？恐怕没那么简单。

那个对女性充满苦毒、对自己有极端扭曲看法的男人，若只是去背一些相关的经文——即便那些经文都非常贴合他的处境——你觉得光是背下来、思想一下就足够彻底改变他吗？恐怕不会。

他需要的不仅是“文字”，而是“活的话语”；不仅是“教条”，而是“生命之道”。那我们在哪里找到这样的“活的话语”呢？

你必须把《箴言》放进整本圣经的大背景里来看，就会看到一件事。

在约翰福音 5:39，耶稣对文士和法利赛人说：“你们查考圣经，因你们以为内中有永生。”换句话说：你们仔细研究律法书，是因为你们相信，在这经文里有“生命的话语”。耶稣接着说，某种意义上他们是对的——圣经的确有生命之道，但耶稣补上一句关键的话：“这经就是为我作见证的。”

也就是说：你们读律法，是因为你们相信它给你们“生命”；这没错。但你们必须明白，整本圣经在讲什么——圣经总的来讲是在讲我。

《箴言》第八章里有一段极美的诗歌，智慧被人格化，与你一起读的时候，你会发现好像“神和智慧一起创造世界”：智慧在说话，智慧被描绘成一个位格，她说：“我在创世之初与神同在，神创造世界、创造人类的时候，我在那里，与祂一同作工。”你读到这段，就会说：“好美的诗！”这当然是一种诗意的方式在说：神用智慧创造了世界。

但这只是“诗歌”吗？当你翻到约翰福音第一章，会读到这样的话：“太初有道，道与神同在，道就是神。……万物是藉着他造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是藉着他造的。”你又一次看见，有一位“道”，与神同在，又是神自己，与神一同创造万有。

圣经在宣称什么？耶稣自己又在宣称什么？

圣经在说：耶稣就是神的智慧，因为祂就是“那位活的道”。祂是那句真正能使人得智慧的“生命之道”——只要你真正抓住祂，把祂的话放在心里。

想一想——这是我这周重新想到、觉得很有意思的一点：什么是“智慧”？智慧不仅是“知识”。我们通常会说：“智慧是被应用出来的知识。”换句话说，智慧就是“落到地上的知识”，是被带进日常生活、带进现实世界的知识。

智慧就是“被带到街头的知识”，是“应用出来的知识”。我们都认识一些“知识很丰富的人”，但他们并不聪明；也认识一些“很聪明的人”，却并不有智慧。智慧是“落地的知识”。

那耶稣是谁？祂是“神被表达出来的样子”，是“神的具象化”。祂是神的智慧本身，祂是神亲自“落到地上”的样子，是神成为一个具体的人。

我们常说：“神是有荣耀的、是圣洁的、是慈爱的。”但这些词本身都是抽象的。你若只是背这一串形容词，并不会真正改变你的心，也不会使你有智慧，更不会把你的心从那些你已经交托给其他事物的地方拉出来。

但有一件事可以：耶稣基督就是神，是神的智慧本身。祂就是那位智慧，祂是那位“活的道”，是那位“亲自来到地上的神”。

所以，你要看祂。在约翰福音第三章和第四章，你看见两位属灵的寻求者：

在第三章，尼哥底母来找耶稣，耶稣对他非常直接：“你必须重生。”
在第四章，撒玛利亚妇人同样在属灵上寻找，耶稣却对她极其温柔、有耐心。

再看约翰福音第 11 章，拉撒路死了，玛大和马利亚这两位丧亲的姐妹都对耶稣说同样的一句话：“主啊，你若早在这里，我兄弟就不会死。”处境一样、话也一样，但耶稣的回应完全不同：

对玛大，耶稣和她讲神学：“复活在我，生命也在我。”
对马利亚，耶稣只是与她同哭。

为什么在这里祂讲道理、在那里祂掉眼泪？为什么这里显得很直接、甚至有点严厉，那里却温柔、柔软？因为耶稣不被某一种“性格气质”限制住。祂不是那个“永远只会用同一种反应方式”的人。

祂是完全的智慧，是至高的智慧，是神的智慧本身。你在圣经里读到的一切关于神的属性、真理，在祂身上不再只是抽象概念，而是“落地的智慧”。祂就是神的圣洁、神的爱、神的荣耀被浓缩在一个具体的人身上。

当你在新约页面中注视祂，看见祂如何行事、如何反应、如何爱人、如何责备人、如何面对十字架，并在心里反复思想祂的荣美时，这才是那种真正会改变你心的东西。

尤其是，当你看见祂在十字架上为你所做的一切时，这种改变才会真正深入你心底。保罗说，希腊人和罗马人看十字架是“愚拙”的——为什么？

为什么希腊人和罗马人会觉得十字架是“愚拙”的呢？因为在他们的观念里，如果一位弥赛亚真有智慧，他怎么会被那样处死？在《箴言》中我们一次又一次读到：愚昧人受责打，因为他们该受责打——“鞭子是为愚昧人的背”。愚昧人不断受惩罚，因为他们既该受惩罚，又愚蠢到不会避开后果。

如果你有智慧，你就不会走到被鞭打、被钉十字架那一步；你不会被囚禁，不会被羞辱。照他们的逻辑，这样的结局只配愚人，不配智慧人。

但福音说：耶稣基督本身就是神的智慧，是完美、完全的智慧。然而，在祂生命的尽头，祂却“站在愚昧人的位置上”。祂承担了愚昧人该受的鞭打，承担了我们该受的死亡。

当你看见祂为你这样死时，你就会爱祂，而这份爱才是真正改变人心的力量。

你再看经文里对“智慧”的描述：“要爱她，要珍惜她，要拥抱她。”智慧被人格化，经文在说：光是去研读一堆规则是不够的，你要“深深地爱上智慧”。

那要怎样才能爱上智慧呢？答案是：爱祂。拥抱祂，珍惜祂。当你看见祂在十字架上为你受死时，你就能真真实实地这么做。

当你在新约的页面中不断思想祂的荣美、思想祂是谁——你越看见祂，祂的品格就越深地烧刻在你心里。你会重新拿回你的心，因为再没有什么——没有任何一个美貌的女人，没有任何一份辉煌的事业——能像祂那样美、那样值得你把整颗心交托。

你会夺回那颗原本交给偶像的心，把它重新交给祂。

祂就是那位“活的道”，那位“活的话语”。这就是智慧的道路。

我们一起祷告：

父啊，我们求你帮助我们，看见这段经文真正所说的：我们可以非常具体地、真实地“保守我们的心”，因为我们爱智慧、拥抱智慧、追求智慧、珍惜智慧——而那位智慧就是你的儿子耶稣。

父啊，当我们在圣经中看见祂如何行走、如何说话、如何做事、如何以智慧行在世上，又看见祂走向十字架的时候，求你使我们越来越爱祂，好让祂的榜样不再只是一个榜样，而是成为那位“活的话语”，进入我们心里，重塑我们的故事，改变我们的生命。

求你使我们像耶稣那样有智慧。奉那位里面藏着一切智慧和知识宝藏的主耶稣的名祷告，阿们。

我们奉祂的名祷告——在祂里面藏着一切智慧和知识的宝藏。

阿们。
