### Introduction: The Need for Wisdom

Welcome to the Gospel Unliked Podcast. Many of the questions we face in life are complex and aren't always answered by simply following rules. Do I speak up now or do I wait? Should I take that job or stay where I am? That's why wisdom is so crucial. But how do we develop it? Today join us as Tim Keller explores how we apply God's wisdom to the everyday complexities of our lives.

The scripture this morning is from Proverbs chapter 4 verses 5 to 9 and verses 14 to 27.

> Get wisdom. Get understanding. Do not forget my words or turn away from them. Do not forsake wisdom and she will protect you, love her and she will watch over you. The beginning of wisdom is this. Get wisdom, though it costs you all you have, get understanding, cherish her and she will exalt you, embrace her and she will honor you. She will give you a garland to grace your head and present you with a glorious crown.

**We live in a culture of choice.** Now I know that often is an advertisement, it's a slogan, but it's really true. Most places and most times in history, you didn't choose who you married. It's a fairly recent idea that you decided instead of your parents. But of course, that's just the beginning. We are free to be who we want to be, live as we want to live. Do the things we want to do because our culture is the most individualistic culture in the history of the world, and therefore our place and our parents and our social location do not determine so much what we can do. We have choices, choices, and what does that mean? That means that we've never needed wisdom more than we do now because wisdom is the ability to make wise choices. It's not enough just to be good and decent. Here's two careers you could choose. They're both morally permissible. Neither is sinful. Neither of them is wrong about either of them. But if you choose unwisely, if you choose the wrong one, one that doesn't fit you, you could lose years of your life, actually, it could be a disaster. We've never needed wisdom more than we do now.

### Part One: A Glorious Fight

#### 1. The Pursuit of Wisdom

What we've been doing for three weeks, and this is the last of the three, we've been looking at the early chapters of the book of Proverbs in the Bible. We're looking at the themes of the book of Proverbs. We've been looking at what wisdom is. It's competence with regard to the complex realities of life. We've been looking at how you develop wisdom. Today we're looking at this famous passage where we learn three things that characterize a wise life. If you want to lead a life of wisdom, that life will be characterized by three things. A glorious fight, a guarded heart, a living word. Let's take a look.

First of all, the way of wisdom is the way of our life of wisdom is basically, it could be characterized as a glorious fight. This is five to nine I'm thinking of. Get wisdom, get understanding. Do not forsake wisdom, though it cost you all you have, get understanding, cherish her, embrace her, and she will give you a garland to grace your head and present you with a glorious crown.

The words all through there are various words that get across diligent exertion and determination of will. The word get that comes up four times is actually the word that means purchase and it means a costly purchase, so it's the language of sacrifice and besides that it says right there in verse seven, it will cost you all you have, get wisdom. Do not forsake in verse six literally means don't let go of be dogged, relentlessness. So there's sacrifice, there's relentlessness. Notice that there's a language here, it's a metaphor of pursuing a woman to marry. It says don't forsake her, love her, cherish her, embrace her, and she will respond and she will honor you, so that's the language of passion and pursuit.

### Part Two: A Guarded Heart

#### 1. The Importance of the Heart

Second thing, a wise life is not just characterized by a glorious fight, but by a guarded heart. What do we mean by a guarded heart? That's the second thing. Before it considering that the book of Proverbs is all about Proverbs is all about wisdom and getting wisdom, verse 23 is pretty amazing because essentially it's saying, and there's nothing more important than this if you're going to be wise. Above all else, verse 23, guard your heart for everything you do flows from it.

Now that is not the modern understanding of the heart. We believe the heart is the seed of the emotions. We think that the thoughts come from the head and the emotions come from the heart. Now we live in a day in time in which the emotions are privileged. We have lots and lots of science fiction. One of the meta narratives of all the Star Trek movies and television series is that machines have reason. You know, robots and computers have reason, but we only, we have emotions, and that's what makes us human. What makes us human is not reason, but it's emotion. That's what makes us not a machine, but a human being.

### Part Three: A Living Word

#### 1. The Role of Scripture

The answer is actually right here in verse 20, 21 and 22, it tells you the teacher of the Torah. Now the person who is addressing the young man or young man is reading the book of Proverbs, all through the book of Proverbs, keeps talking about, I'm going to give you my words, and you need to guard my words, and you need to take my words. What are those words? Are the words of the teacher of the Torah, which is the law of God? It's the scripture. And the book of Proverbs, in fact, all the wisdom literature is basically taking the law of God, the great principles of the law of God, and bringing them down to earth into daily life, applying the law of God, the great principles and precepts of the law of God into daily life.

**Jesus is the wisdom of God, because he is the living word.** He's the word that if you grasp and you put in your heart will make you wise. Now, I want you to think about this, it's actually just struck me this week. What is wisdom? It's not just knowledge, right? We say it's knowledge applied. Wisdom is knowledge brought down to earth, brought down to earth, brought down to street level. It's applied. We know lots of people who are knowledgeable that they're just not smart, or they're smart, but they're not wise. Wisdom is knowledge brought down to earth. Who is Jesus? He is God expressed. He is God embodied. He is God's wisdom. He is God literally brought down to earth. He is God brought into human form.

Let's pray.

Our Father, we ask that you would help us to see the... We can take this very, very literally. We can guard our heart because we love wisdom. We embrace wisdom. We pursue wisdom. We cherish wisdom because it's Jesus. And Father, as we see him walking and acting and behaving and doing things in the Bible in a wise way, but then seeing going to the cross, as we fall in love with him, then his example becomes more than an example. It really becomes a living word brought into our hearts, reframing and reshaping us. Please, O Lord, make us wise the way Jesus is wise. We pray the name of Him in whom all the treasures of knowledge and wisdom are hidden. Amen.

### 引言：智慧的必要性

欢迎来到福音不受欢迎播客。我们生活中面临的许多问题都很复杂，并不是简单地遵循规则就能解决的。我现在该发声还是等待？我应该接受那份工作还是留在原地？这就是为什么智慧如此重要。但我们如何培养智慧呢？今天请加入我们，听听 Tim Keller 如何探讨我们如何将上帝的智慧应用于我们生活中的日常复杂性。如果您收听今天的教导，我们邀请您访问 gospelunlife.com 并注册电子邮件更新。当您注册时，您将收到我们的季度期刊和其他有价值的以福音为中心的资源。今天就订阅 gospelunlife.com。

今天早上的经文来自箴言第 4 章第 5 至 9 节和第 14 至 27 节。

> 得智慧，得聪明，不可忘记，也不可偏离我口中的言语。不可离弃智慧，智慧就护卫你；要爱她，她就保守你。智慧为首，所以要得智慧。在你一切所得之内，必得聪明。高举她，她就使你高升；怀抱她，她就使你尊荣。她必将华冠加在你头上，把荣冕交给你。

**我们生活在一个选择的文化中。** 我知道这通常是一个广告口号，但这确实是真的。历史上大多数地方和大多数时候，你不能选择你要嫁的人。你决定而不是你的父母是一个相对较新的想法。当然，这只是个开始。我们可以自由地成为我们想成为的人，过我们想过的生活。做我们想做的事情，因为我们的文化是世界历史上最个人主义的文化，因此我们的地位、父母和社会位置并不决定我们能做什么。我们有选择，选择，这意味着什么？这意味着我们比以往任何时候都更需要智慧，因为智慧是做出明智选择的能力。仅仅是善良和正派是不够的。这里有两个职业你可以选择。它们都是道德上允许的。没有一个是有罪的。对它们中的任何一个都没有错。但如果你选择不明智，如果你选择了不适合你的那个，你可能会失去多年的生命，实际上，这可能是一场灾难。我们比以往任何时候都更需要智慧。

### 第一部分：荣耀的争战

#### 1. 追求智慧

我们已经进行了三周的研究，这是最后一周，我们一直在研究圣经中箴言书的早期章节。我们正在研究箴言书的主题。我们一直在研究智慧是什么。它是关于生活复杂现实的能力。我们一直在研究你如何发展智慧。今天我们正在研究这段著名的经文，我们学习到智慧生活的三个特征。如果你想过一种智慧的生活，那种生活将以三件事为特征。一个荣耀的争战，一个守护的心，一个活的道。让我们来看看。

首先，智慧的道路是我们智慧生活的道路，基本上可以被描述为一个荣耀的争战。这是我想到的五到九节。得智慧，得聪明。不可离弃智慧，虽然它会花费你所有的一切，得聪明，珍惜她，拥抱她，她就会给你一个花冠来装饰你的头，并给你一个荣耀的冠冕。

贯穿整个段落的词语都是传达勤奋努力和意志力的决心。出现四次的“得”这个词实际上是指购买，意味着昂贵的购买，所以这是牺牲的语言，此外它在第七节中直接说，它会花费你所有的一切，得智慧。第六节中的“不可离弃”字面意思是不要放手，要顽强，不屈不挠。所以有牺牲，有不屈不挠。注意这里的语言，这是追求一个女人结婚的隐喻。它说不要离弃她，爱她，珍惜她，拥抱她，她就会回应你，她就会尊重你，所以这是激情和追求的语言。

### 第二部分：守护的心

#### 1. 心的重要性

第二件事，一个智慧的生活不仅以荣耀的争战为特征，还以守护的心为特征。我们所说的守护的心是什么意思？这是第二件事。考虑到箴言书完全是关于智慧和获得智慧的，23 节非常惊人，因为它本质上是在说，如果你想变得聪明，没有什么比这更重要的了。最重要的是，23 节，守护你的心，因为一切你所做的都从中流出。

这不是现代对心的理解。我们相信心是情感的种子。我们认为思想来自头脑，情感来自心。现在我们生活在一个情感被优先考虑的时代。我们有大量的科幻小说。所有《星际迷航》电影和电视剧的元叙事之一是机器有理性。你知道，机器人和计算机有理性，但我们只有，我们有情感，这就是使我们成为人类的原因。使我们成为人类的不是理性，而是情感。这就是使我们不是机器，而是人类。

### 第三部分：活的道

#### 1. 圣经的角色

答案实际上就在第 20、21 和 22 节中，它告诉你律法的教师。现在，正在对年轻人或年轻人讲话的人正在阅读箴言书，贯穿整个箴言书，不断谈论，我要给你我的话语，你需要守护我的话语，你需要接受我的话语。那些话语是什么？是律法教师的话语，也就是上帝的律法？是圣经。事实上，所有智慧文学基本上都是将上帝的律法，伟大的律法原则，带到地上应用于日常生活，将上帝的律法，伟大的原则和戒律应用于日常生活。

**耶稣是上帝的智慧，因为他是活的道。** 他是如果你掌握并放在心中会使你变得聪明的道。现在，我想让你思考这个，这实际上只是本周让我震惊。智慧是什么？不仅仅是知识，对吧？我们说这是应用的知识。智慧是知识被带到地上，被带到地上，被带到街头层面。它是应用的。我们知道很多有知识的人，他们只是没有聪明，或者他们聪明，但他们不聪明。智慧是知识被带到地上。耶稣是谁？他是上帝的表达。他是上帝的体现。他是上帝的智慧。他是上帝字面上被带到地上。他是上帝被带入人形。

让我们祷告。

我们的父，我们请求你帮助我们看到... 我们可以非常非常字面地理解这一点。我们可以守护我们的心，因为我们爱智慧。我们拥抱智慧。我们追求智慧。我们珍惜智慧，因为它是耶稣。父，当我们看到他在圣经中行走、行动、表现和做事时是多么聪明，但然后看到他走向十字架，当我们爱上他时，他的榜样就不仅仅是一个榜样。它真的成为一个活的道进入我们的心，重新塑造和重塑我们。请，哦主，使我们像耶稣一样聪明。我们祈祷他的名，在他里面隐藏着所有知识和智慧的宝藏。阿门。
