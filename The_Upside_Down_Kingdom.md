Welcome to Gospel in Life. This month on the podcast, we are featuring a series on the Sermon on the Mount, a collection  of teachings where Jesus outlines what it really means to live the Christian life. In the series, Tim Keller explores a striking idea that Christianity is not just different  from the world, it's also radically different from religion. He went down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples were there and a great number of people from all over  Judea from Jerusalem and from the coast of Tyre and Sidon who had come to hear him and  be healed of their diseases.

Those troubled by evil spirits were cured and all the people, the people all tried to  touch him because power was coming from him and healing them all. Blessed are you who are poor for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are you who hunger now for you will be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now for you will laugh. Blessed are you when men hate you and when they exclude you and insult you and reject  your name as evil because of the Son of Man.

Rejoice in that day and leap for joy because great is your reward in heaven. For that is how their fathers treated the prophets. But woe to you who are rich for you who have already received your comfort. And woe to you who are well fed for you will go hungry and woe to you who laugh now for you will  mourn in weep and woe to you when all men speak well of you. For that is how their fathers treated the false prophets as his God's word.

Now as Tim just said it's spring and it's traditional actually for centuries in the church  to at the at spring time to turn our thoughts to what it means to live the Christian life. You see you get to Easter which is right around the corner and when you get to Easter  and you celebrate the resurrection it's only natural to start to ask this question. How can we live a newness of life? How do we live the resurrected life? What does it mean to live the Christian life?

Now there's three or four perhaps classic places to go in the Bible to get a  tremendous picture of what it means to actually live as a Christian in the world. And one of those places is the sermon on the mount. And we're going to be looking at the sermon on the mount from here all the way through to the beginning of summer. Just for that reason. Now we have the sermon on the mount.

We have two accounts excuse me of Jesus delivering this sermon on the mount. He did it more than once. This discourse was given more than once. We have in Luke chapter six a somewhat shorter version of or a shorter version. In other words, when he preached he didn't say as much in Matthew chapter five to seven.

When that account is given of that delivering of the sermon on the mount, it's longer. One thing is interesting is that they are both associated. The delivery of the sermon is both in both cases associated with a mountain. Of course, Matthew chapter five, one, it says he went up on a mountain side. Here you see in verse 17, what does it say?

It says he came down but where was he? He was on a mountain side. He had been up there with his disciples teaching them. Why does association with a mountain? Well, from what we can tell, Jesus preached this sermon in the mountains up above the sea of Galilee, just north of and above it.

The mountains of north of the sea of Galilee had the very same function that mountains have had for centuries. If you were a revolutionary, if you wanted to bring in a new kingdom or new administration, you were a hunted man, you were hunted. What you would do is you usually, if you were a revolutionary, you would hide out in the mountains. That's the reason why the revolutionaries would hide out in whales. In the northern part of whales, that's where they would hide out.

Those who are trying to bring in the Welsh kingdom and break the rule of the English and so forth. In every place, you see the revolutionaries hide in the mountains. So Jesus Christ goes to the mountains. Why? Because he is bringing a revolution.

He is a subversive. He actually says in the very first verse of his sermons, the verse 20, he says, I'm coming to bring a new administration. I'm coming to bring a kingdom. A new kingdom to replace the old kingdom. However, when you actually begin to understand what he says, this kingdom is.

You begin to realize that every other revolutionary who ever lived was really only just trying to make small fine tuning to the old kingdom. Just trying to rework, re-shuffle the old kingdom. Now, Jesus Christ brings is a revolutionary that's the most radical because the values and the pattern and the power and the product of his kingdom is utterly different. Now, you see what's the kingdom I just told you? A kingdom always has three things.

It's got a pattern. In other words, anything that can any king or any new administration always has got a pattern of values. If a coach takes over the team, immediately he says, you know, conditioning. I know the last coach wasn't into conditioning, but I'm into conditioning. There's any kingdom, any new administration, any management is going to bring in a new set of values.

There'll be a pattern of values. Secondly, a kingdom has a power to implement the pattern of values. Thirdly, there's always a product. The pattern as it's implemented is going to have an effect. All we're going to find out is if the coach gets into power and he puts his program into place, will the team win?

Will the players reach their potential? Will the morale go up? What will happen? So there's always a kingdom always, always has an impact, always has an influence. So you'll always have a pattern put into power and it produces a product, results in people's lives.

In verses 20 to 23, it's showing us the pattern and the power and the product of his kingdom. And in verses 24 to 26, he's showing the kingdom that it replaces, which is a wholly different pattern, a wholly different power and a wholly different set of results. And what we're going to do here, this is a sort of introduction to everything else he's going to say in the sermon on the mount, we're going to look at these two kingdoms as well. There's really only two. And one thing you've got to keep in mind is that you're either a citizen of one or the other.

Paul says in Colossians 3.1, he has rescued us from the kingdom of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of his dear son. So you're either a citizen of one or your citizen of the other, but something else you've got to keep in mind. Even if you are a citizen of Christ's kingdom, we've got a very interesting place in Romans where Paul says the night is far spent, the day is at hand, live is in the light. What Paul is saying, and it's very important for us to understand this, Paul is saying that where we are spiritually in the history of the world is dawn. The day is at hand, which means the light is coming, the night is far spent, they're both happening.

It's not day, it's not night. If you've been around dawn, you realize it's both. The day is coming, the night is leaving, but they're both there. And Paul says, what you have to make sure is you live is in the light. You better dress, you better put on your makeup as if the light's coming because it's coming.

Don't be fooled by the darkness, and this means that even though you may be a citizen of the kingdom of Jesus Christ, you can still live under the influence of the old kingdom. And really when it comes, so therefore when it comes down to an understanding, not only the fact that there are two kingdoms, but the patterns of the two kingdoms is absolutely critical for living in this world if you want to live as a Christian. Now what are those two kingdoms? We're going to look briefly at the first one, the old kingdom, the kingdom of Christ is replacing, and we're going to look a little more extensively at the new one. And I'm going to call the old one, the right side up kingdom, and the new one, the upside down kingdom.

Okay, here's why. First of all, the right side up kingdom. Now the reason we're going to, well I'll tell you why I call it right side up for a minute, but you can see every kingdom has got certain values up here and other values down here. There's always certain things you put on the top and certain things you put down, certain things you say, these are good, our priorities, and other things that you say, these aren't very good. These are things that we avoid, these are things that we ask to, these are things that we stay away from.

And in the kingdom of Christ is replacing, which is outlined there in verses 23 to 24 to 26. Here's what we have. What's on top? What are the values? Power, comfort, success, recognition.

First of all, power. I know it says the first thing actually says the rich, but of course, riches and poverty is really a matter of power, as we know. Power. Secondly, humor well fed. Well, it has to do with material comfort.

Nice clothes, great restaurants, beautiful home. So you have comfort. Thirdly, you who laugh. Now you know the word for laugh there. This is one of the values of this kingdom.

The word for laugh there is a kind of negative word, and the experts in Greek will tell you it really is a word that means more like basically to gloat. It's the, when you've won the election, it's the party. I won. They lost. And so it's not just talking so much about fun.

It's not just talking about happiness in general. It's talking about success. It's talking about the party you have after you've got the promotion, the party you've got after you've beaten the other candidate, and so on. And then lastly, our men speak well of you. Recognition, acclaim, popularity, celebrity.

These are the values of the kingdom. Christ is replacing. And of course, you see the opposite. The things that this kingdom puts down, things to avoid, things to stay away from, things we disdain, things we sneer at are in verses 20 to 23. And what are those things?

Basically, weakness. Sacrifice, discomfort, grief, or put it this way, weakness, sacrifice, grief, exclusion. You're excluded. You're weeping. And some of the things that this particular kingdom says go for power and comfort and success and recognition.

And what are we going to do with weakness and grieving and sacrifice and exclusion? We do everything we can to avoid those things. Now the reason we call this the right side up kingdom. Not from God's point of view, but from our point of view. It's right side up because it seems utterly natural to put these things up here.

Totally natural. And the reason is the power of this kingdom is the power of the now. Look carefully in verses 24 to 26. And you'll see it says that wealth and power and success and comfort. These are things now.

You're laughing now. If you basically go for success, if that's your goal, if you basically go for power, if you basically go for happiness and for, you know, to avoid suffering, if you basically go for recognition for a claim, these things pay off. Now, they give you results. And you know, of course, if the now is real, if the now is really the only real, and you know, for most of us, the now, I mean, the past is gone in the future, who knows what will happen. The now, if the now is all there really is, if this world is all there is, absolutely.

This set of values seems absolutely natural. Absolutely natural. It's biologically natural. I mean, have you heard of evolution? Have you heard of the survival of the weak, the survival of the rejected, the survival of the satisfying, forget it.

Biologically, it's totally unnatural. It's natural to say power and so on. It's psychologically natural. I found this is an interesting quote by a British psychiatrist and a very, very fairly prominent psychiatrist. He says this,  the spirit that so permeates Christianity is in my opinion, masochism.

A much stronger expression of masochism is to be found, or the strongest expression of masochism is to be found in Christ teaching in the Sermon on the Mount. This blesses the poor, the meek, the persecuted, to do good to them to hate you and forgive them that their trespasses, all this breeds masochism. See, the right side up kingdom, I call it right side up because when you think about it, it just seems biologically, psychologically, utterly natural. That these things would be up. Who would value weakness?

Who would value sacrifice? Who would value grief? Who would value exclusion and rejection? Forget it. But what's the product?

Now, Jesus says, when you live according to these values, driven by the power of the now, because it results. He says, it's temporary. You will only laugh now, but later you'll weep. It's temporary. You'll be filled now, but later you'll be empty.

And what he's saying is actually common sense. Because to see, in other words, if you say, the now is all that matters. Who knows about eternity? Who knows about other things? The now.

If you build your life on the now, you get results in the now, but the plain fact is that these things have to crumble eventually. If you build your life on your beauty, your claim, your beauty, your beauty is going to fade. If you build your life on people who love you, they are going to die. If you build your life on achievement and power, your records will be eclipsed. And also if the now isn't all there is.

If there actually is an eternal world, then of course a person who builds their life on power and comfort and success and recognition here. If you build your life on that, if that's your bottom line, if that's your ultimate value, and this world is not all there is, then of course he's saying your full stomach is going to actually turn into cosmic emptiness. Your laughter is going to turn into cosmic grief and weeping. Now, somebody says, and this is a good question, how do we know that Jesus is right? You see, when you actually move out into the world, there is no doubt that the right side up kingdom, the reason I'm calling it right side up is to value these things seems absolutely right.

Any other approach seems like suicide. Why would you value weakness? Who would do that? Why would you value sacrifice? Why would you value tears?

Why in the world? You move on out. And therefore it makes no sense. And so what Jesus is saying goes absolutely against everything we believe. So why should we believe him?

And here's the answer. I never forget, I was, for some reason I was reading a commentary, good commentary on this chapter. And the commentator points out that Jesus came down from the mountain, healing, feeding. See, power was going out, the miracles. And the commentator said, the handwriting on the wall, see Daniel 5.

And sometimes commentaries are just too pithy. I say, the handwriting is on the wall. Jesus comes down the mountain. Daniel, what are we talking about? Well here's what we're talking about.

In Daniel chapter 5, if you go back there, you'll find that there was a man, Bill Schasser, who was the last king of the Babylonian empire. And Cyrus the Persian was closing in on the city. And he knew he couldn't possibly win. And he knew his empire was going to be over. And so what he did was he had an enormous party.

And they got drunk. And he brought in his concubines. One of the things I realized when I looked at Daniel 5, was that his utter that was never done. You didn't bring your concubines in, you know, to, you know, along with your wives, they were always going to touch you about your concubines. And it income the concubines.

And they brought it, it was a wild party. And suddenly the handwriting began on the wall. Of a hand moved on the wall. And it basically said, your days are numbered. When Jesus Christ showed up, and he began to heal the sick, to raise the dead, to feed the hungry, to die on a cross.

That's the handwriting on the wall for the old kingdom and the old ways. If you are living for yourself,  if you are spending all your money on yourself, if you are not living like Jesus Christ lived, and if he really did come, and if he really did those miracles, that means that you're like El Shazzar having this huge party. And your kingdom's about to crumble. The handwriting's on the wall. I began to realize it gave me a chill when I began to realize what the commentator was saying.

He was saying, you have to ask yourself, was there a Jesus Christ? Did he live the life he did? If he did, that means that the shutters are going to come down on the kingdom of living for myself, rising up to the top, doing everything I can for success, and throwing a few bobbles to the poor on the way. And occasionally going to church with things are unhappy, and always sticking around with people of my caliber. The whole right side of kingdom that seems absolutely to be the only way to go, because Jesus Christ lived the life he lived, touching the lepers, giving himself the poor, dying on the cross, coming as a poor man,  coming and riding into town on a bar of donkey, and eating his last meal in a borrowed room, and being buried in a bar of tomb, and giving up everything, he comes with power, and this is the handwriting on the wall for anybody who will not live according to the pattern of his life.

So you have to say, you know, you say, well, I don't know if Jesus has ever lived, I don't know if he ever did these miracles, I don't know if he did any of these things, and of course, then you need to look at that. And that's not the sermon, that's not what we're talking about today. We're not talking about, how do we know if Jesus lived and died? I'm not going to give you the evidence, I'm not going to take you to the text. But if he did, if he lived the life, anything like what the Bible is saying, your days are numbered, Bill Shazzar, unless you were living a life which is upside down from the way the world thinks things should go.

Now let's take a look at the upside down kingdom. That was the right side up kingdom. What is the upside down kingdom? Well, you know, I've already said so, but let me give you another quote by one of those commentators that helped me so much for this week. A guy named Michael Wilcock wrote a commentary on Luke and he says this about this passage.

It perfectly, he says it perfectly. In fact, when I read it, I should just end, but I won't. In the life of God's people, it will be seen, first of all, a remarkable reversal of values. The people of God will prize what the world calls pitiable and suspect what the world thinks desirable. In other words, the mark of what makes you a Christian is a reversal of values.

The things that the world puts as pitiable, we prize. He said, Michael Wilcock says, we prize, wait a minute, we prize weakness, sacrifice, grief and exclusion. Are we the massacres that the psychiatrist said we are and the answer is prize is not the same thing. Prize is not the same thing as seeking. In fact, if you seek it, I'll show you in a minute, you're just as controlled by the old world's values.

But what we're saying is, pricing means that when it comes, we see its value. When it comes, we understand what it's doing in our lives. When it comes, we're not saying, oh my word, our life is over. If, if, if when these things happen to you, if when weakness comes, when all these things hit you, you say, oh my, my life is over. You're not the influence of the old world.

The old kingdom, the kingdom has been replaced, the kingdom on which the hand writing has been written. We prize it when it happens, we know its value and we prize the people who are going through it, we're attracted to them, we get into their lives to try to millivate their lives. Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer? Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith? For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding of what it means to follow Christ.

A great resource to start using this summer is the new city catechism devotional, God's truth for our hearts and minds. This devotional brings the historic catechisms of the Christian Church to life, offering a question to consider for each week of the year. In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catechesis, the rich and communal practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers that frame the foundational beliefs of the Christian faith. Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer and a brief meditation that will challenge and inspire you. The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller and Kevin D.

Young, as well as historical figures such as Augustine, John Calvin and Martin Luther. This month, in addition to the new city catechism devotional, we are including a great companion resource, the new city catechism for kids, as our thank you for your gift to help Gospel and Life share the hope of Christ's love with people all over the world. So request your copies today at gospelandlife.com slash give. That's gospelandlife.com slash give. Now here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching.

Now let me break this down. Let's look at the pattern, the power and the product of the upside down kingdom. Number one, the pattern. The pattern of the upside down kingdom is a reversal of values with regard to the world. In other words, Christians are no longer controlled by the things that the world thinks are so critical.

We're not controlled by power, success. We're not controlled by comfort or recognition. We're not controlled by them. Now let me point this out to you for a second. If you can't take them, if you run away from them, if you can't stand being around money, if you have no idea what to do with recognition, if you absolutely can't stand being around people with any power at all,  if you run from them, you are still controlled by them.

You're scared of them. It probably means down deep inside you're intimidated by them or you still really want them. But a person who's a Christian, who's living in the upside down kingdom, isn't controlled by these things. You don't need them, which means you don't want them. They don't drive you.

They're not things that control you and that means you can take them or you can leave them. And that is the first mark of somebody who's living in the upside down kingdom. That's the pattern of your life. For example, here's a non-Christian. Here's a Christian.

Stand alongside of each other. Better shouldn't put it that way. Here's a member of the Old Kingdom. Here's a member of the New Kingdom. Because you know, let's not talk about Christian non-Christian for a second.

Here's a person who's being controlled by the right side of the kingdom and a person who's being controlled by the upside down kingdom. And let's say they're both in the same situation in their job. If they tell the truth, they're going to lose their job. When you see a person who's under the influence of the Old Kingdom, of the right side of the kingdom, is going to have to lie. They're slaves.

They're going to have to lie. Why? Because they can't do without that house and granite. Because they can't do without power and without comfort. They can't do without success.

They can't do that. They can't do. But a Christian says, hey, I have to do whatever I have to do. Because these things don't bother me anymore. Now, where does that come from?

And the answer is, there is a couple of wonderfully paradoxical statements in the passage that tell you the secret dynamic here. First of all, notice how all the way through. Jesus says, blessed are you who weep now. Blessed are you who hunger now. Okay.

Blessed are you who weep now. Look at the paradox. You know what that means? First of all, you're weeping. Now, you're weeping.

Something's going wrong in your life. But you're blessed. And you know, the word blessed means deeply satisfied. Jesus says, a Christian is somebody who can weep and still be blessed. A person who lives under the old kingdom, if something you lose your job, you lose the love when you lose reputation.

And you see blessedness and laughter go together. Blessedness and weeping can never go together. But in the new kingdom, they do. Because there's a blessedness that is not got to do with circumstances. Actually, a better place the other place that shows the paradox is verse 23.

When he says, rejoice and leap for joy in that day for great is your reward in heaven. Now boy, Karl Marx used to look at verses like this and used to say, oh, that's what I hate. That's what I hate about Christianity. The opium of the people. See, great is your reward in heaven.

So I'm supposed to trust your life and not fight injustice and just accept my lot in life. Because later on, I'll have pie in the sky, buy in the future. But there's no future here. There's no future. Since that's not what going on, Karl Marx.

I'm sorry you can't be here to hear this. What it says is rejoice in that day. What day? Not the judgment day in the day that you're excluded. Verse 23 is referring to verse 22.

In the day, you're excluded. Well, how can you rejoice in that day? Because great is your reward in heaven, not will be. This is what's going on. Colossians chapter three, Acts chapter seven.

I've never gotten over Acts chapter seven. Here's Stephen. He's about to be stoned to death. He's about to be executed. I've never gotten over this.

How is he going to handle it with courage and how is he going to handle it with love? How will he keep from fear and how will he keep from anger toward the people who are doing this great injustice? Well, he looks to heaven and he suddenly says, he says, I see the glory of God and I see Jesus Christ standing at the right hand of the Father. In other words, he says, I realize that though down here this kangaroo court is doing injustice to me before God, I'm vindicated. And a Christian is somebody according to Colossians three chapter one who says this.

I have set my mind not on things below, but on things are above for my life is hid with God in Christ. A Christian is somebody who says, I've lost recognition, but I'm famous with God. See, that's weeping, but blessed. I've been excluded, but I'm welcome by God. See?

That's exclusion, but leaping for joy. And a Christian, because you have that pattern, because you've got that, you therefore are not controlled by the world's values. Those things don't control you anymore. You're living a free life. That's the reversal.

Now, here's a couple practical things before we move on. You realize what this means? Karl Marx is utterly wrong. If this world is all there is and working for injustice will lose my job or lose my reputation or lose my life, then I'm not going to do it. But if I've got a blessedness, if I have a leap for joy because of my standing in heaven, now, I see my standing in heaven.

That means, of course, I can work against injustice because so what if I lose my reputation, so what if I lose my life? If I see injustice in my neighborhood, I stand up for it, so what if I'm ostracized, okay? If I see injustice in the company, I blow the whistle, so what if I lose my job? You say, I want to know who lives like that. If you've got the resources to live with that kind of integrity, you've got the resources to live with that kind of courage.

Absolutely. This is not the opening of the people. This is the smelling salts of the people. This will wake you up. You see, not only if this is true, will you live with integrity but keep this in mind.

What's great about this is it really means that you no longer have to have these things or have not to have these things. I already mentioned that. And you want to live a bitter life if somebody takes it from you. So that's the pattern. The pattern is I have a complete reversal because I'm free from the world's value.

But secondly, okay, where do you get the power for this? And somebody says, yeah, where do you get the power for it? I don't completely understand. Well, look, it says where you get the power. It right there in verse 19.

Him. Jesus Christ's life is an example of the very way in which we're supposed to live. Jesus comes into the world even though he's the king and he's poor. Now, he even talks about it here. He says, he says, don't be upset.

If you're excluded, don't be upset. If you are rejected, don't be upset. If you're a failure, don't be upset. If you're weeping because this is how the prophets always have been. He says, this is what's always happened to the prophets.

He says, have you ever heard of a successful prophet? Have you ever heard of a happy prophet? A happy prophet. Have you ever heard of a popular prophet? See what Jesus is saying?

And now, what is he saying, though? If it's true that the prophets have always lived according to these values,  how much more the great prophet, the true prophet, the ultimate prophet, if the representatives of the king lived this way,  how much the real king when he finally comes? And when he comes, you see Jesus Christ becoming poor. You see him being totally rejected. And finally, when he's on the cross, he's not only rejected by his friends and by the crowd, he's even excluded by his father.

And yet he is, you see, he gives himself. And you say, oh yes, that's an example. That's where we're supposed to get the power. The example of Christ? No.

If Christ only came as an example of the reversal of the world's values, I don't think he'd be of any power to you at all. He would just be a burden. He would just make you feel terrible. He would say, oh my goodness, I'm supposed to be willing to be generous. Oh my goodness, I'm supposed to be willing to do all these things.

Oh no, I can never live like Jesus. And he wouldn't be a power at all if it was just an example. But here's what the gospel is. The gospel is not that we look at Jesus reversing his fortunes with people. You see, we don't see him becoming weak to make people strong.

We don't see him becoming poor to make people rich. You have to see that everything he did was to reverse fortunes with you. Why can he say, though you are weeping now, you will rejoice because he took the weeping you deserve, the cosmic weeping. He died in the dark. Why can he say, you will be comforted because he was utterly disconsolate.

He was thrown away. Why can he say, you will be satisfied because he was utterly dissatisfied on the cross, Jesus Christ. Why can he say these things? Why can he say, you can know that you have this great standing in heaven because you can live in reversal of values because you live by his reversal. He took your place.

He put you where he deserves to be before the throne of God accepted beloved and he put himself where you deserve to be cast out. Because of that, that's where you get the power. That's where you get the power. That's the reason why Jesus Christ can look at his disciples and say, blessed are you who are poor. Now in some of them were poor.

Look at see verse 19 and 20 says he looked at his disciples and said, blessed are you poor. But now Matthew for example is a tax collector. We know he wasn't poor. Why can he look at all of his disciples like this and the answer is because basically the only way for you to actually receive this power is to be poor in spirit. Let me give you two ways of looking at God.

One way of looking at God is like this. I have nothing of value. God owes me nothing. He would be just to cut me off. But I rely completely on what Jesus Christ has done for me and ask that he accept me.

The other approach goes like this. I've lived a fairly good life. I've lived a pretty decent life. God owes me something. He owes me a few things.

He owes me some comfort. He shouldn't let bad things happen to me. Now the first one is being poor in spirit. The second one is being middle class in spirit. Middle class in spirit simply is what?

It's the right side of Kingdom. I've worked. I've done my best. I've done my duty. God owes me at least a little bit.

He shouldn't let bad things happen to me. If that is your heart, you see Jesus as an example, maybe, but you'll never see him as someone who actually substituted himself for you. You won't have the power that comes from knowing that he reversed his fortunes with you because he reversed his fortunes with you. You can reverse your fortunes with everybody. In other words, a Christian who knows where you're standing in heaven is, you live recklessly.

You don't get rid of your money and you don't keep all your money. You live recklessly with your money. What do you mean by that? I did that on purpose. What I mean is if you really are living in this upside down Kingdom, it means that you are going to be so generous that you put yourself somewhat of financial risk.

It means you're going to be so generous with your money, but you're also going to be so generous with your heart that sometimes people will exploit you emotionally. You're going to be so involved in trying to help people work out their differences that sometimes people will get mad at you. Christians don't care because they say, well, my money, it's nice to have it. My privacy, it's nice to have it. My comfort is nice to have it, but I'm going to live like Jesus because of who I am before him.

I'm not controlled by these things. So I'm able to move out in a sense live in a way that the world will consider reckless because I'm poor in spirit, not middle class in spirit. If you also live by this power, you will also see when bad things happen to you. People who live in the old Kingdom look at what troubles and difficulties and what do they say? They say, my life is meaningless, but Christians know that when you're poor, when you're weeping, when you're empty, the Kingdom of God is near.

This is another way in which the upside down Kingdom says, strength is weakness and weakness is strength. Let's admit it, when have you really come to know yourself? When have you really come to meet Christ? When have you really come to get connected with God? It's not when you're rich, not when you're happy, not when you're laughing, not when you're included.

It's the opposite. And therefore Christians are willing to go out and sacrifice themselves and when I use the word reckless, I don't mean irresponsible. I mean, reckless as far as the world would understand. The world would say, anybody who gives that kind of money away, you should be saving up for a rainy day. You need to make sure anybody who gives your life like that.

Of course people are going to kind of explore you occasionally, but a Christian will have such strength in Christ that by the world standards, a Christian is going to look reckless and is not afraid of weeping and is not afraid of emptiness and sacrifice. Because I know the Kingdom of God makes progress in my life and the lives of other people when it happens. Now lastly, one last thing and it's pretty important. The pattern of the upside down Kingdom is what? It's a total reversal of your attitude toward the things that the world thinks are so important, power and comfort and success and recognition.

Secondly, the power is to know the Christ reversed places with you. Then lastly and very important. Why? Why does Jesus Christ say here at the very end? I mean right here at the very beginning, blessed are the poor.

Whereas in Matthew chapter 5, he says, blessed are the poor and spirit. People have continually gone back and forth and said, I really don't know which it is. Is Jesus Christ saying that my gospel is really for just the poor in spirit? You don't have to be really literally poor. You just have to be poor in spirit.

Or is the gospel really for the literally poor? And the answer is there's a deliberate duality. There's a deliberate ambiguity. The gospel will take middle class people. The gospel will take Christians and turn them toward their hearts toward the poor.

Whereas the gospel will take the poor and turn their hearts toward the rest of Christians. You see, the poor know salvation has got to be by grace. You never find the poor having a kind of very, very nice ethical religion. The poor tend to say, I believe in the blood of Jesus. I believe in salvation by grace.

Why? Because you see, they don't have the illusion that we're really in control of our lives. If the reason why you're on top of things is because you work so hard, the poor know that everything's a matter of grace. And therefore the poor, the poor are more open to the gospel, but the gospel will take a middle class person and say, you are saved by grace alone and turn your heart toward the poor. And so one of the things you see in the, in the surround amount is if you really understand the gospel, who you associate with will be the test.

Do you only hang out with people who are of your caliber? Do you only hang out with people who seem to be, you know, have achieved what you've achieved? Or do you recognize that you are what you are by the grace of God alone? Who your friends are? Who you hang out with?

Very, very much a matter of the lifestyle of a Christian. So here's where we are. The hand-writing is on the wall for the old kingdom. You have to ask yourself some very, very simple questions. Am I living a life in which I'm controlled by what the world says?

Or am I living a life like Christ? I can only live a life like Christ if I say that he's come into my place and take in his place for me. So I can stand in his place. I don't want you to be like Bell Shazzar, and much rather you'd be like Nebuchadnezzar, because Nebuchadnezzar was the king before Bell Shazzar in the book of Daniel. And God showed up in a dream and said, I'm going to cut you down.

You're like a big tree, but I'm going to cut you down, but you're going to grow back once you realize that all success is an unmerited grace. And Nebuchadnezzar was smitten down. You remember some of it? If you remember the story, he was a terrible blow. He fell into mental illness.

But when he woke up, unlike Bell Shazzar, he realized that he'd been living his life according to the old way of the kingdom. And he got up and he said, everything is a gift of grace. And he changed the way in which he did everything. Don't be like Bell Shazzar. Be like Nebuchadnezzar.

Live in the upside down kingdom, not in the right side of kingdom. Let's pray. Father, we ask that you give us an ability to apply this. In some of our cases, it means being much more generous than we've been. In some of our cases, it means rethinking who we spend time with.

It's a sweeping and comprehensive theme. We pray, Lord, as the weeks go on, we can break this down and see what this actually means for us in every single area of our lives. But we pray that you would help us today to be humbled, not like Bell Shazzar who just simply continued to party harder, but like Nebuchadnezzar who raised his eyes to heaven. We ask that you would make us people who live according to the upside down kingdom. Show us what that means by your spirit in Jesus' name we pray.

### English Transcript (for reference)

Welcome to Gospel in Life. This month on the podcast, we are featuring a series on the Sermon on the Mount, a collection  of teachings where Jesus outlines what it really means to live the Christian life. In the series, Tim Keller explores a striking idea that Christianity is not just different  from the world, it's also radically different from religion. He went down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples were there and a great number of people from all over  Judea from Jerusalem and from the coast of Tyre and Sidon who had come to hear him and  be healed of their diseases.

Those troubled by evil spirits were cured and all the people, the people all tried to  touch him because power was coming from him and healing them all. Blessed are you who are poor for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are you who hunger now for you will be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now for you will laugh. Blessed are you when men hate you and when they exclude you and insult you and reject  your name as evil because of the Son of Man.

Rejoice in that day and leap for joy because great is your reward in heaven. For that is how their fathers treated the prophets. But woe to you who are rich for you who have already received your comfort. And woe to you who are well fed for you will go hungry and woe to you who laugh now for you will  mourn in weep and woe to you when all men speak well of you. For that is how their fathers treated the false prophets as his God's word.

Now as Tim just said it's spring and it's traditional actually for centuries in the church  to at the at spring time to turn our thoughts to what it means to live the Christian life. You see you get to Easter which is right around the corner and when you get to Easter  and you celebrate the resurrection it's only natural to start to ask this question. How can we live a newness of life? How do we live the resurrected life? What does it mean to live the Christian life?

Now there's three or four perhaps classic places to go in the Bible to get a  tremendous picture of what it means to actually live as a Christian in the world. And one of those places is the sermon on the mount. And we're going to be looking at the sermon on the mount from here all the way through to the beginning of summer. Just for that reason. Now we have the sermon on the mount.

We have two accounts excuse me of Jesus delivering this sermon on the mount. He did it more than once. This discourse was given more than once. We have in Luke chapter six a somewhat shorter version of or a shorter version. In other words, when he preached he didn't say as much in Matthew chapter five to seven.

When that account is given of that delivering of the sermon on the mount, it's longer. One thing is interesting is that they are both associated. The delivery of the sermon is both in both cases associated with a mountain. Of course, Matthew chapter five, one, it says he went up on a mountain side. Here you see in verse 17, what does it say?

It says he came down but where was he? He was on a mountain side. He had been up there with his disciples teaching them. Why does association with a mountain? Well, from what we can tell, Jesus preached this sermon in the mountains up above the sea of Galilee, just north of and above it.

The mountains of north of the sea of Galilee had the very same function that mountains have had for centuries. If you were a revolutionary, if you wanted to bring in a new kingdom or new administration, you were a hunted man, you were hunted. What you would do is you usually, if you were a revolutionary, you would hide out in the mountains. That's the reason why the revolutionaries would hide out in whales. In the northern part of whales, that's where they would hide out.

Those who are trying to bring in the Welsh kingdom and break the rule of the English and so forth. In every place, you see the revolutionaries hide in the mountains. So Jesus Christ goes to the mountains. Why? Because he is bringing a revolution.

He is a subversive. He actually says in the very first verse of his sermons, the verse 20, he says, I'm coming to bring a new administration. I'm coming to bring a kingdom. A new kingdom to replace the old kingdom. However, when you actually begin to understand what he says, this kingdom is.

You begin to realize that every other revolutionary who ever lived was really only just trying to make small fine tuning to the old kingdom. Just trying to rework, re-shuffle the old kingdom. Now, Jesus Christ brings is a revolutionary that's the most radical because the values and the pattern and the power and the product of his kingdom is utterly different. Now, you see what's the kingdom I just told you? A kingdom always has three things.

It's got a pattern. In other words, anything that can any king or any new administration always has got a pattern of values. If a coach takes over the team, immediately he says, you know, conditioning. I know the last coach wasn't into conditioning, but I'm into conditioning. There's any kingdom, any new administration, any management is going to bring in a new set of values.

There'll be a pattern of values. Secondly, a kingdom has a power to implement the pattern of values. Thirdly, there's always a product. The pattern as it's implemented is going to have an effect. All we're going to find out is if the coach gets into power and he puts his program into place, will the team win?

Will the players reach their potential? Will the morale go up? What will happen? So there's always a kingdom always, always has an impact, always has an influence. So you'll always have a pattern put into power and it produces a product, results in people's lives.

In verses 20 to 23, it's showing us the pattern and the power and the product of his kingdom. And in verses 24 to 26, he's showing the kingdom that it replaces, which is a wholly different pattern, a wholly different power and a wholly different set of results. And what we're going to do here, this is a sort of introduction to everything else he's going to say in the sermon on the mount, we're going to look at these two kingdoms as well. There's really only two. And one thing you've got to keep in mind is that you're either a citizen of one or the other.

Paul says in Colossians 3.1, he has rescued us from the kingdom of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of his dear son. So you're either a citizen of one or your citizen of the other, but something else you've got to keep in mind. Even if you are a citizen of Christ's kingdom, we've got a very interesting place in Romans where Paul says the night is far spent, the day is at hand, live is in the light. What Paul is saying, and it's very important for us to understand this, Paul is saying that where we are spiritually in the history of the world is dawn. The day is at hand, which means the light is coming, the night is far spent, they're both happening.

It's not day, it's not night. If you've been around dawn, you realize it's both. The day is coming, the night is leaving, but they're both there. And Paul says, what you have to make sure is you live is in the light. You better dress, you better put on your makeup as if the light's coming because it's coming.

Don't be fooled by the darkness, and this means that even though you may be a citizen of the kingdom of Jesus Christ, you can still live under the influence of the old kingdom. And really when it comes, so therefore when it comes down to an understanding, not only the fact that there are two kingdoms, but the patterns of the two kingdoms is absolutely critical for living in this world if you want to live as a Christian. Now what are those two kingdoms? We're going to look briefly at the first one, the old kingdom, the kingdom of Christ is replacing, and we're going to look a little more extensively at the new one. And I'm going to call the old one, the right side up kingdom, and the new one, the upside down kingdom.

Okay, here's why. First of all, the right side up kingdom. Now the reason we're going to, well I'll tell you why I call it right side up for a minute, but you can see every kingdom has got certain values up here and other values down here. There's always certain things you put on the top and certain things you put down, certain things you say, these are good, our priorities, and other things that you say, these aren't very good. These are things that we avoid, these are things that we ask to, these are things that we stay away from.

And in the kingdom of Christ is replacing, which is outlined there in verses 23 to 24 to 26. Here's what we have. What's on top? What are the values? Power, comfort, success, recognition.

First of all, power. I know it says the first thing actually says the rich, but of course, riches and poverty is really a matter of power, as we know. Power. Secondly, humor well fed. Well, it has to do with material comfort.

Nice clothes, great restaurants, beautiful home. So you have comfort. Thirdly, you who laugh. Now you know the word for laugh there. This is one of the values of this kingdom.

The word for laugh there is a kind of negative word, and the experts in Greek will tell you it really is a word that means more like basically to gloat. It's the, when you've won the election, it's the party. I won. They lost. And so it's not just talking so much about fun.

It's not just talking about happiness in general. It's talking about success. It's talking about the party you have after you've got the promotion, the party you've got after you've beaten the other candidate, and so on. And then lastly, our men speak well of you. Recognition, acclaim, popularity, celebrity.

These are the values of the kingdom. Christ is replacing. And of course, you see the opposite. The things that this kingdom puts down, things to avoid, things to stay away from, things we disdain, things we sneer at are in verses 20 to 23. And what are those things?

Basically, weakness. Sacrifice, discomfort, grief, or put it this way, weakness, sacrifice, grief, exclusion. You're excluded. You're weeping. And some of the things that this particular kingdom says go for power and comfort and success and recognition.

And what are we going to do with weakness and grieving and sacrifice and exclusion? We do everything we can to avoid those things. Now the reason we call this the right side up kingdom. Not from God's point of view, but from our point of view. It's right side up because it seems utterly natural to put these things up here.

Totally natural. And the reason is the power of this kingdom is the power of the now. Look carefully in verses 24 to 26. And you'll see it says that wealth and power and success and comfort. These are things now.

You're laughing now. If you basically go for success, if that's your goal, if you basically go for power, if you basically go for happiness and for, you know, to avoid suffering, if you basically go for recognition for a claim, these things pay off. Now, they give you results. And you know, of course, if the now is real, if the now is really the only real, and you know, for most of us, the now, I mean, the past is gone in the future, who knows what will happen. The now, if the now is all there really is, if this world is all there is, absolutely.

This set of values seems absolutely natural. Absolutely natural. It's biologically natural. I mean, have you heard of evolution? Have you heard of the survival of the weak, the survival of the rejected, the survival of the satisfying, forget it.

Biologically, it's totally unnatural. It's natural to say power and so on. It's psychologically natural. I found this is an interesting quote by a British psychiatrist and a very, very fairly prominent psychiatrist. He says this,  the spirit that so permeates Christianity is in my opinion, masochism.

A much stronger expression of masochism is to be found, or the strongest expression of masochism is to be found in Christ teaching in the Sermon on the Mount. This blesses the poor, the meek, the persecuted, to do good to them to hate you and forgive them that their trespasses, all this breeds masochism. See, the right side up kingdom, I call it right side up because when you think about it, it just seems biologically, psychologically, utterly natural. That these things would be up. Who would value weakness?

Who would value sacrifice? Who would value grief? Who would value exclusion and rejection? Forget it. But what's the product?

Now, Jesus says, when you live according to these values, driven by the power of the now, because it results. He says, it's temporary. You will only laugh now, but later you'll weep. It's temporary. You'll be filled now, but later you'll be empty.

And what he's saying is actually common sense. Because to see, in other words, if you say, the now is all that matters. Who knows about eternity? Who knows about other things? The now.

If you build your life on the now, you get results in the now, but the plain fact is that these things have to crumble eventually. If you build your life on your beauty, your claim, your beauty, your beauty is going to fade. If you build your life on people who love you, they are going to die. If you build your life on achievement and power, your records will be eclipsed. And also if the now isn't all there is.

If there actually is an eternal world, then of course a person who builds their life on power and comfort and success and recognition here. If you build your life on that, if that's your bottom line, if that's your ultimate value, and this world is not all there is, then of course he's saying your full stomach is going to actually turn into cosmic emptiness. Your laughter is going to turn into cosmic grief and weeping. Now, somebody says, and this is a good question, how do we know that Jesus is right? You see, when you actually move out into the world, there is no doubt that the right side up kingdom, the reason I'm calling it right side up is to value these things seems absolutely right.

Any other approach seems like suicide. Why would you value weakness? Who would do that? Why would you value sacrifice? Why would you value tears?

Why in the world? You move on out. And therefore it makes no sense. And so what Jesus is saying goes absolutely against everything we believe. So why should we believe him?

And here's the answer. I never forget, I was, for some reason I was reading a commentary, good commentary on this chapter. And the commentator points out that Jesus came down from the mountain, healing, feeding. See, power was going out, the miracles. And the commentator said, the handwriting on the wall, see Daniel 5.

And sometimes commentaries are just too pithy. I say, the handwriting is on the wall. Jesus comes down the mountain. Daniel, what are we talking about? Well here's what we're talking about.

In Daniel chapter 5, if you go back there, you'll find that there was a man, Bill Schasser, who was the last king of the Babylonian empire. And Cyrus the Persian was closing in on the city. And he knew he couldn't possibly win. And he knew his empire was going to be over. And so what he did was he had an enormous party.

And they got drunk. And he brought in his concubines. One of the things I realized when I looked at Daniel 5, was that his utter that was never done. You didn't bring your concubines in, you know, to, you know, along with your wives, they were always going to touch you about your concubines. And it income the concubines.

And they brought it, it was a wild party. And suddenly the handwriting began on the wall. Of a hand moved on the wall. And it basically said, your days are numbered. When Jesus Christ showed up, and he began to heal the sick, to raise the dead, to feed the hungry, to die on a cross.

That's the handwriting on the wall for the old kingdom and the old ways. If you are living for yourself,  if you are spending all your money on yourself, if you are not living like Jesus Christ lived, and if he really did come, and if he really did those miracles, that means that you're like El Shazzar having this huge party. And your kingdom's about to crumble. The handwriting's on the wall. I began to realize it gave me a chill when I began to realize what the commentator was saying.

He was saying, you have to ask yourself, was there a Jesus Christ? Did he live the life he did? If he did, that means that the shutters are going to come down on the kingdom of living for myself, rising up to the top, doing everything I can for success, and throwing a few bobbles to the poor on the way. And occasionally going to church with things are unhappy, and always sticking around with people of my caliber. The whole right side of kingdom that seems absolutely to be the only way to go, because Jesus Christ lived the life he lived, touching the lepers, giving himself the poor, dying on the cross, coming as a poor man,  coming and riding into town on a bar of donkey, and eating his last meal in a borrowed room, and being buried in a bar of tomb, and giving up everything, he comes with power, and this is the handwriting on the wall for anybody who will not live according to the pattern of his life.

So you have to say, you know, you say, well, I don't know if Jesus has ever lived, I don't know if he ever did these miracles, I don't know if he did any of these things, and of course, then you need to look at that. And that's not the sermon, that's not what we're talking about today. We're not talking about, how do we know if Jesus lived and died? I'm not going to give you the evidence, I'm not going to take you to the text. But if he did, if he lived the life, anything like what the Bible is saying, your days are numbered, Bill Shazzar, unless you were living a life which is upside down from the way the world thinks things should go.

Now let's take a look at the upside down kingdom. That was the right side up kingdom. What is the upside down kingdom? Well, you know, I've already said so, but let me give you another quote by one of those commentators that helped me so much for this week. A guy named Michael Wilcock wrote a commentary on Luke and he says this about this passage.

It perfectly, he says it perfectly. In fact, when I read it, I should just end, but I won't. In the life of God's people, it will be seen, first of all, a remarkable reversal of values. The people of God will prize what the world calls pitiable and suspect what the world thinks desirable. In other words, the mark of what makes you a Christian is a reversal of values.

The things that the world puts as pitiable, we prize. He said, Michael Wilcock says, we prize, wait a minute, we prize weakness, sacrifice, grief and exclusion. Are we the massacres that the psychiatrist said we are and the answer is prize is not the same thing. Prize is not the same thing as seeking. In fact, if you seek it, I'll show you in a minute, you're just as controlled by the old world's values.

But what we're saying is, pricing means that when it comes, we see its value. When it comes, we understand what it's doing in our lives. When it comes, we're not saying, oh my word, our life is over. If, if, if when these things happen to you, if when weakness comes, when all these things hit you, you say, oh my, my life is over. You're not the influence of the old world.

The old kingdom, the kingdom has been replaced, the kingdom on which the hand writing has been written. We prize it when it happens, we know its value and we prize the people who are going through it, we're attracted to them, we get into their lives to try to millivate their lives. Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer? Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith? For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding of what it means to follow Christ.

A great resource to start using this summer is the new city catechism devotional, God's truth for our hearts and minds. This devotional brings the historic catechisms of the Christian Church to life, offering a question to consider for each week of the year. In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catechesis, the rich and communal practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers that frame the foundational beliefs of the Christian faith. Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer and a brief meditation that will challenge and inspire you. The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller and Kevin D.

Young, as well as historical figures such as Augustine, John Calvin and Martin Luther. This month, in addition to the new city catechism devotional, we are including a great companion resource, the new city catechism for kids, as our thank you for your gift to help Gospel and Life share the hope of Christ's love with people all over the world. So request your copies today at gospelandlife.com slash give. That's gospelandlife.com slash give. Now here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching.

Now let me break this down. Let's look at the pattern, the power and the product of the upside down kingdom. Number one, the pattern. The pattern of the upside down kingdom is a reversal of values with regard to the world. In other words, Christians are no longer controlled by the things that the world thinks are so critical.

We're not controlled by power, success. We're not controlled by comfort or recognition. We're not controlled by them. Now let me point this out to you for a second. If you can't take them, if you run away from them, if you can't stand being around money, if you have no idea what to do with recognition, if you absolutely can't stand being around people with any power at all,  if you run from them, you are still controlled by them.

You're scared of them. It probably means down deep inside you're intimidated by them or you still really want them. But a person who's a Christian, who's living in the upside down kingdom, isn't controlled by these things. You don't need them, which means you don't want them. They don't drive you.

They're not things that control you and that means you can take them or you can leave them. And that is the first mark of somebody who's living in the upside down kingdom. That's the pattern of your life. For example, here's a non-Christian. Here's a Christian.

Stand alongside of each other. Better shouldn't put it that way. Here's a member of the Old Kingdom. Here's a member of the New Kingdom. Because you know, let's not talk about Christian non-Christian for a second.

Here's a person who's being controlled by the right side of the kingdom and a person who's being controlled by the upside down kingdom. And let's say they're both in the same situation in their job. If they tell the truth, they're going to lose their job. When you see a person who's under the influence of the Old Kingdom, of the right side of the kingdom, is going to have to lie. They're slaves.

They're going to have to lie. Why? Because they can't do without that house and granite. Because they can't do without power and without comfort. They can't do without success.

They can't do that. They can't do. But a Christian says, hey, I have to do whatever I have to do. Because these things don't bother me anymore. Now, where does that come from?

And the answer is, there is a couple of wonderfully paradoxical statements in the passage that tell you the secret dynamic here. First of all, notice how all the way through. Jesus says, blessed are you who weep now. Blessed are you who hunger now. Okay.

Blessed are you who weep now. Look at the paradox. You know what that means? First of all, you're weeping. Now, you're weeping.

Something's going wrong in your life. But you're blessed. And you know, the word blessed means deeply satisfied. Jesus says, a Christian is somebody who can weep and still be blessed. A person who lives under the old kingdom, if something you lose your job, you lose the love when you lose reputation.

And you see blessedness and laughter go together. Blessedness and weeping can never go together. But in the new kingdom, they do. Because there's a blessedness that is not got to do with circumstances. Actually, a better place the other place that shows the paradox is verse 23.

When he says, rejoice and leap for joy in that day for great is your reward in heaven. Now boy, Karl Marx used to look at verses like this and used to say, oh, that's what I hate. That's what I hate about Christianity. The opium of the people. See, great is your reward in heaven.

So I'm supposed to trust your life and not fight injustice and just accept my lot in life. Because later on, I'll have pie in the sky, buy in the future. But there's no future here. There's no future. Since that's not what going on, Karl Marx.

I'm sorry you can't be here to hear this. What it says is rejoice in that day. What day? Not the judgment day in the day that you're excluded. Verse 23 is referring to verse 22.

In the day, you're excluded. Well, how can you rejoice in that day? Because great is your reward in heaven, not will be. This is what's going on. Colossians chapter three, Acts chapter seven.

I've never gotten over Acts chapter seven. Here's Stephen. He's about to be stoned to death. He's about to be executed. I've never gotten over this.

How is he going to handle it with courage and how is he going to handle it with love? How will he keep from fear and how will he keep from anger toward the people who are doing this great injustice? Well, he looks to heaven and he suddenly says, he says, I see the glory of God and I see Jesus Christ standing at the right hand of the Father. In other words, he says, I realize that though down here this kangaroo court is doing injustice to me before God, I'm vindicated. And a Christian is somebody according to Colossians three chapter one who says this.

I have set my mind not on things below, but on things are above for my life is hid with God in Christ. A Christian is somebody who says, I've lost recognition, but I'm famous with God. See, that's weeping, but blessed. I've been excluded, but I'm welcome by God. See?

That's exclusion, but leaping for joy. And a Christian, because you have that pattern, because you've got that, you therefore are not controlled by the world's values. Those things don't control you anymore. You're living a free life. That's the reversal.

Now, here's a couple practical things before we move on. You realize what this means? Karl Marx is utterly wrong. If this world is all there is and working for injustice will lose my job or lose my reputation or lose my life, then I'm not going to do it. But if I've got a blessedness, if I have a leap for joy because of my standing in heaven, now, I see my standing in heaven.

That means, of course, I can work against injustice because so what if I lose my reputation, so what if I lose my life? If I see injustice in my neighborhood, I stand up for it, so what if I'm ostracized, okay? If I see injustice in the company, I blow the whistle, so what if I lose my job? You say, I want to know who lives like that. If you've got the resources to live with that kind of integrity, you've got the resources to live with that kind of courage.

Absolutely. This is not the opening of the people. This is the smelling salts of the people. This will wake you up. You see, not only if this is true, will you live with integrity but keep this in mind.

What's great about this is it really means that you no longer have to have these things or have not to have these things. I already mentioned that. And you want to live a bitter life if somebody takes it from you. So that's the pattern. The pattern is I have a complete reversal because I'm free from the world's value.

But secondly, okay, where do you get the power for this? And somebody says, yeah, where do you get the power for it? I don't completely understand. Well, look, it says where you get the power. It right there in verse 19.

Him. Jesus Christ's life is an example of the very way in which we're supposed to live. Jesus comes into the world even though he's the king and he's poor. Now, he even talks about it here. He says, he says, don't be upset.

If you're excluded, don't be upset. If you are rejected, don't be upset. If you're a failure, don't be upset. If you're weeping because this is how the prophets always have been. He says, this is what's always happened to the prophets.

He says, have you ever heard of a successful prophet? Have you ever heard of a happy prophet? A happy prophet. Have you ever heard of a popular prophet? See what Jesus is saying?

And now, what is he saying, though? If it's true that the prophets have always lived according to these values,  how much more the great prophet, the true prophet, the ultimate prophet, if the representatives of the king lived this way,  how much the real king when he finally comes? And when he comes, you see Jesus Christ becoming poor. You see him being totally rejected. And finally, when he's on the cross, he's not only rejected by his friends and by the crowd, he's even excluded by his father.

And yet he is, you see, he gives himself. And you say, oh yes, that's an example. That's where we're supposed to get the power. The example of Christ? No.

If Christ only came as an example of the reversal of the world's values, I don't think he'd be of any power to you at all. He would just be a burden. He would just make you feel terrible. He would say, oh my goodness, I'm supposed to be willing to be generous. Oh my goodness, I'm supposed to be willing to do all these things.

Oh no, I can never live like Jesus. And he wouldn't be a power at all if it was just an example. But here's what the gospel is. The gospel is not that we look at Jesus reversing his fortunes with people. You see, we don't see him becoming weak to make people strong.

We don't see him becoming poor to make people rich. You have to see that everything he did was to reverse fortunes with you. Why can he say, though you are weeping now, you will rejoice because he took the weeping you deserve, the cosmic weeping. He died in the dark. Why can he say, you will be comforted because he was utterly disconsolate.

He was thrown away. Why can he say, you will be satisfied because he was utterly dissatisfied on the cross, Jesus Christ. Why can he say these things? Why can he say, you can know that you have this great standing in heaven because you can live in reversal of values because you live by his reversal. He took your place.

He put you where he deserves to be before the throne of God accepted beloved and he put himself where you deserve to be cast out. Because of that, that's where you get the power. That's where you get the power. That's the reason why Jesus Christ can look at his disciples and say, blessed are you who are poor. Now in some of them were poor.

Look at see verse 19 and 20 says he looked at his disciples and said, blessed are you poor. But now Matthew for example is a tax collector. We know he wasn't poor. Why can he look at all of his disciples like this and the answer is because basically the only way for you to actually receive this power is to be poor in spirit. Let me give you two ways of looking at God.

One way of looking at God is like this. I have nothing of value. God owes me nothing. He would be just to cut me off. But I rely completely on what Jesus Christ has done for me and ask that he accept me.

The other approach goes like this. I've lived a fairly good life. I've lived a pretty decent life. God owes me something. He owes me a few things.

He owes me some comfort. He shouldn't let bad things happen to me. Now the first one is being poor in spirit. The second one is being middle class in spirit. Middle class in spirit simply is what?

It's the right side of Kingdom. I've worked. I've done my best. I've done my duty. God owes me at least a little bit.

He shouldn't let bad things happen to me. If that is your heart, you see Jesus as an example, maybe, but you'll never see him as someone who actually substituted himself for you. You won't have the power that comes from knowing that he reversed his fortunes with you because he reversed his fortunes with you. You can reverse your fortunes with everybody. In other words, a Christian who knows where you're standing in heaven is, you live recklessly.

You don't get rid of your money and you don't keep all your money. You live recklessly with your money. What do you mean by that? I did that on purpose. What I mean is if you really are living in this upside down Kingdom, it means that you are going to be so generous that you put yourself somewhat of financial risk.

It means you're going to be so generous with your money, but you're also going to be so generous with your heart that sometimes people will exploit you emotionally. You're going to be so involved in trying to help people work out their differences that sometimes people will get mad at you. Christians don't care because they say, well, my money, it's nice to have it. My privacy, it's nice to have it. My comfort is nice to have it, but I'm going to live like Jesus because of who I am before him.

I'm not controlled by these things. So I'm able to move out in a sense live in a way that the world will consider reckless because I'm poor in spirit, not middle class in spirit. If you also live by this power, you will also see when bad things happen to you. People who live in the old Kingdom look at what troubles and difficulties and what do they say? They say, my life is meaningless, but Christians know that when you're poor, when you're weeping, when you're empty, the Kingdom of God is near.

This is another way in which the upside down Kingdom says, strength is weakness and weakness is strength. Let's admit it, when have you really come to know yourself? When have you really come to meet Christ? When have you really come to get connected with God? It's not when you're rich, not when you're happy, not when you're laughing, not when you're included.

It's the opposite. And therefore Christians are willing to go out and sacrifice themselves and when I use the word reckless, I don't mean irresponsible. I mean, reckless as far as the world would understand. The world would say, anybody who gives that kind of money away, you should be saving up for a rainy day. You need to make sure anybody who gives your life like that.

Of course people are going to kind of explore you occasionally, but a Christian will have such strength in Christ that by the world standards, a Christian is going to look reckless and is not afraid of weeping and is not afraid of emptiness and sacrifice. Because I know the Kingdom of God makes progress in my life and the lives of other people when it happens. Now lastly, one last thing and it's pretty important. The pattern of the upside down Kingdom is what? It's a total reversal of your attitude toward the things that the world thinks are so important, power and comfort and success and recognition.

Secondly, the power is to know the Christ reversed places with you. Then lastly and very important. Why? Why does Jesus Christ say here at the very end? I mean right here at the very beginning, blessed are the poor.

Whereas in Matthew chapter 5, he says, blessed are the poor and spirit. People have continually gone back and forth and said, I really don't know which it is. Is Jesus Christ saying that my gospel is really for just the poor in spirit? You don't have to be really literally poor. You just have to be poor in spirit.

Or is the gospel really for the literally poor? And the answer is there's a deliberate duality. There's a deliberate ambiguity. The gospel will take middle class people. The gospel will take Christians and turn them toward their hearts toward the poor.

Whereas the gospel will take the poor and turn their hearts toward the rest of Christians. You see, the poor know salvation has got to be by grace. You never find the poor having a kind of very, very nice ethical religion. The poor tend to say, I believe in the blood of Jesus. I believe in salvation by grace.

Why? Because you see, they don't have the illusion that we're really in control of our lives. If the reason why you're on top of things is because you work so hard, the poor know that everything's a matter of grace. And therefore the poor, the poor are more open to the gospel, but the gospel will take a middle class person and say, you are saved by grace alone and turn your heart toward the poor. And so one of the things you see in the, in the surround amount is if you really understand the gospel, who you associate with will be the test.

Do you only hang out with people who are of your caliber? Do you only hang out with people who seem to be, you know, have achieved what you've achieved? Or do you recognize that you are what you are by the grace of God alone? Who your friends are? Who you hang out with?

Very, very much a matter of the lifestyle of a Christian. So here's where we are. The hand-writing is on the wall for the old kingdom. You have to ask yourself some very, very simple questions. Am I living a life in which I'm controlled by what the world says?

Or am I living a life like Christ? I can only live a life like Christ if I say that he's come into my place and take in his place for me. So I can stand in his place. I don't want you to be like Bell Shazzar, and much rather you'd be like Nebuchadnezzar, because Nebuchadnezzar was the king before Bell Shazzar in the book of Daniel. And God showed up in a dream and said, I'm going to cut you down.

You're like a big tree, but I'm going to cut you down, but you're going to grow back once you realize that all success is an unmerited grace. And Nebuchadnezzar was smitten down. You remember some of it? If you remember the story, he was a terrible blow. He fell into mental illness.

But when he woke up, unlike Bell Shazzar, he realized that he'd been living his life according to the old way of the kingdom. And he got up and he said, everything is a gift of grace. And he changed the way in which he did everything. Don't be like Bell Shazzar. Be like Nebuchadnezzar.

Live in the upside down kingdom, not in the right side of kingdom. Let's pray. Father, we ask that you give us an ability to apply this. In some of our cases, it means being much more generous than we've been. In some of our cases, it means rethinking who we spend time with.

It's a sweeping and comprehensive theme. We pray, Lord, as the weeks go on, we can break this down and see what this actually means for us in every single area of our lives. But we pray that you would help us today to be humbled, not like Bell Shazzar who just simply continued to party harder, but like Nebuchadnezzar who raised his eyes to heaven. We ask that you would make us people who live according to the upside down kingdom. Show us what that means by your spirit in Jesus' name we pray.

### 中文翻译

### 引言：登山宝训

本月的播客中，我们推出了一系列关于登山宝训的讲道，这是耶稣教导的一系列内容，阐明了真正的基督徒生活意味着什么。在这个系列中，Tim Keller 探讨了一个引人注目的观点，即基督教不仅与世界不同，而且与宗教也有根本的不同。

> "他和他们一起下山，站在一块平地上。他的门徒有很多，还有来自犹太全地、耶路撒冷以及推罗和西顿海岸的许多人来听他讲道并治愈他们的疾病。"

**你们贫穷的人有福了，因为神的国是你们的。你们现在饥饿的人有福了，因为你们将得饱足。你们现在哭泣的人有福了，因为你们将欢笑。人因人子恨你们、排斥你们、辱骂你们、弃绝你们的名为恶，你们就有福了。在那日要欢喜跳跃，因为你们在天上的赏赐是大的。**

### 正立的国度

#### 1. 正立国度的价值观

在基督要取代的国度中，正如在24到26节中所描述的，价值观是权力、舒适、成功和认可。

- 权力：财富和贫穷实际上是权力的问题。
- 舒适：物质舒适，漂亮的衣服，豪华的餐厅，美丽的家。
- 成功：这里的“笑”一词意味着幸灾乐祸，庆祝胜利。
- 认可：赞誉，名声，名望。

#### 2. 正立国度的力量

这个国度的力量是现在的力量。财富、权力、成功和舒适是现在的事物。

> "如果现在是唯一真实的，如果这个世界就是一切，那么这些价值观似乎绝对自然。"

### 颠倒的国度

#### 1. 价值观的逆转

在神的子民的生活中，将会出现一个显著的价值观逆转。神的子民将珍视世界认为可怜的东西，并怀疑世界认为可取的东西。

- 弱点、牺牲、悲伤和排斥被珍视。
- 基督徒不再被权力、成功、舒适或认可所控制。

#### 2. 颠倒国度的力量

力量来自于知道基督与我们交换了位置。他取代了我们的位置，我们站在他的位置上。

> "贫穷的人有福了。"

**获得这种力量的唯一途径是灵里贫穷。**

### 颠倒国度的模式、力量和结果

#### 1. 模式

颠倒国度的模式是对世界价值观的逆转。

- 基督徒不被世界的价值观所控制。
- 他们可以接受或放弃权力、成功、舒适和认可。

#### 2. 力量

力量来自基督的榜样和他为我们的替代。

- 耶稣变得贫穷并被拒绝，甚至被他的父亲拒绝。
- 他与我们交换了命运，给予我们力量。

#### 3. 结果

结果是过着正直和勇敢的生活。

- 基督徒以世界的标准过着无所畏惧的生活，不怕哭泣或空虚。
- 他们知道当这些事情发生时，神的国在他们的生活和他人的生活中取得进展。

### 结论

旧国度的末日已到。我们必须问自己，我们是过着被世界价值观控制的生活，还是以基督的榜样生活。

> "不要像伯沙撒，要像尼布甲尼撒。生活在颠倒的国度中，而不是正立的国度中。"

**让我们祈祷有能力在我们的生活中应用这一点，谦卑地生活在颠倒的国度中。**

## Chinese Transcript / 中文

欢迎收听 Gospel in Life。本月播客推出一系列关于“登山宝训”的信息，这是耶稣的一组教导，说明真正的基督徒生活是什么样的。在这一系列里，提摩太·凯勒要展开一个非常惊人的思想：基督教不仅与这个世界不同，它甚至与“宗教”本身也截然不同。

耶稣和门徒一同下山，站在一块平地上。他的门徒有一大群在那里，还有许多从犹太全地、耶路撒冷、推罗、西顿沿海一带来的百姓，他们来是要听他讲道，也要得医治。

凡被污鬼缠磨的都得了医治，众人都想挤到他跟前摸他，因为有能力从他身上出来，医治他们所有的人。耶稣说：你们贫穷的人有福了，因为神的国是你们的。你们现在饥饿的人有福了，因为你们将要饱足。你们现在哀哭的人有福了，因为你们将要喜笑。人为人子恨恶你们、拒绝你们、辱骂你们、弃掉你们的名以为恶，你们就有福了。

那日你们要欢喜跳跃，因为你们在天上的赏赐是大的。他们的祖宗待先知也是这样。但你们富足的人有祸了，因为你们受过你们的安慰。你们饱足的人有祸了，因为你们将要饥饿。你们喜笑的人有祸了，因为你们将要哀恸哭泣。人都说你们好的时候，你们就有祸了，因为他们的祖宗待假先知也是这样。这是神的话。

正如刚刚所说，按教会几百年的传统，每到春天，教会都会特别思想“怎样过基督徒的生活”。复活节临近，当我们庆祝基督的复活，很自然就会提出这个问题：既然耶稣复活了，我们怎么活出“新生命”？怎样活出“复活的生命”？基督徒的生活到底意味着什么？

圣经中有三四处经典经文，极其生动地描绘了“作为一个基督徒在世上生活”究竟是什么样子，其中之一就是登山宝训。从现在起到夏天初，我们都会一直查考登山宝训，就是出于这个缘故。

圣经中有两处记载耶稣讲这篇“山上宝训”的情形，说明他不是只讲过一次，而是多次讲过类似的信息。路加福音第六章给出的是一个较短的版本，马太福音第五到七章则是篇幅更长的一次。两处都把这篇讲道与“山”联系起来：马太福音五章一节说，他上了山；路加这里十七节则说，他从山上下来，但仍旧是在山坡上，刚刚在山上教导门徒。

为什么要特别强调“山”？按地理来看，耶稣是在加利利海北面的山地——在海北、海上的山上讲这篇道。而在历史上，山地常常是革命者的藏身之处。如果你要推翻旧政权、建立新王朝，你就是被追捕的人，你就会躲到山里。英国历史中，威尔士北部的山区，就曾是反叛者躲避英格兰统治、筹划“威尔士王国”的基地。各地皆然，革命者都往山里去。

耶稣也上山，因为他要带来一场“革命”。他是颠覆性的。他在这篇讲章最开头（20节）就宣告：我来是要带来一个新的政权，一个新的国度，要取代旧的国度。

但当你真正理解他所说的“国度”是什么时，你会发现，历史上所有其他革命者做的不过是对旧王国的小修小补、调换一下权力结构而已。唯独耶稣带来的，是最彻底、最激进的革命：他国度的价值体系、运行的能力、以及所产生的结果，都与旧国度完全不同。

任何一个“国度”其实都有三样东西：第一是“模式”或“价值观的样式”。任何新上任的君王、教练、管理层都会带来自己的一套价值观。一个新教练接手球队，会说：“我要严抓体能训练；上一任不太看重这一点，但我看重。”任何新政权都会带来一套新的价值排序。

第二，一个国度必须有“能力”，能把这套价值观落实出来。第三，当这套模式被实践出来，就一定会有“结果”，会在人的生命中产生影响。足球教练上任之后，把他的训练计划实施了，结果是球队会不会赢？球员会不会发挥潜力？士气会不会上来？总之，一个国度必定会在人的生命中留下印记：有价值观，有执行的能力，也有产生的结果。

在 20–23 节，耶稣向我们展示了他国度的“价值模式、能力和结果”；在 24–26 节，他则描绘出被他取代的那个旧国度——那是完全不同的一套价值、能力和结局。整篇山上宝训都在展开这两种国度的对比；世界上其实就只有这两种国度，而你必然是其中之一的公民。

保罗在歌罗西书 1 章 13 节说，神“救了我们脱离黑暗的权势，把我们迁到他爱子的国度里”。你要么属于黑暗国度，要么属于基督的国度。但即使你已经是基督国度的子民，还有一点需要记住：保罗在罗马书中说，“黑夜已深，白昼将近”，你们要按白昼的样式生活。他的意思是，在救赎历史中，我们现在所处的位置就像黎明：白昼要来，黑夜已去，但两者仍然交织并存。

黎明既不是完全的白天，也不是全然的黑夜；你站在黎明，会同时看到光与暗。保罗说，你要按着“白昼”来打扮自己——穿衣、化妆都当作光已经来了，不要被仍然存在的黑暗欺骗。因此，即便你已经是天国公民，你依然可能活在旧国度的影响之下。

所以，要真正按基督徒的身份在世上生活，就必须清楚地认识这两个国度各自的“模式”。接下来，我们要先简略看旧国度——耶稣要取代的那个“正过来的国度”，然后再稍微详细地看新国度——我称之为“颠倒的国度”。

我之所以称前者为“正过来的国度”，不是从神的角度，而是从人的直觉来看：它看起来非常自然、顺理成章。每个国度都会把某些东西放在上面、高举为“好、重要、值得追求”；也会把一些东西放在下面，当作要躲避、要排斥的。耶稣在 24–26 节里面概括了这个旧国度所推崇的价值：权势、安逸、成功、名望。

首先是“富足”——这不仅仅是钱，而是权力与资源的集中。其次是“吃得饱足”——更广义就是物质上的舒适：好衣服、好餐馆、美丽的房子。第三是“欢笑”——原文的“笑”带有幸灾乐祸、自我夸耀的意味，好像在说：“我赢了，他们输了。”这是那种赢了选举开派对、升职加薪请客庆功的笑。最后是“人都说你们好”——也就是公众的认可、掌声、名气。

与此同时，这个国度所轻看、要极力回避的，则是“贫穷、饥饿、哀哭、被恨恶、被排斥、被侮辱”——总的说来就是软弱、牺牲、痛苦、被排除在圈子之外。这一套看起来是“正过来的”价值观：谁会主动去追求软弱？谁喜欢牺牲？谁乐意被排挤？

之所以说它“看起来是正的”，是因为以“现在”为基准，这确实很合理。你仔细看 24–26 节，那些富足、饱足、欢笑、得人称赞的都是“现在”的得着。若你把今生当作唯一的真实，把“现在”看成一切，那么追求权势、安逸、成功、名望就是最自然不过的事。

从生物学上看，进化论讲的是“适者生存”，不是“软弱者生存、不被接纳者生存、满足于少者生存”。从心理学上看，世人也会觉得，耶稣这套“哀哭有福、被排斥有福”的说法简直是自虐。有位英国精神科医生就说，基督教的精神在他看来就是“受虐狂”，登山宝训更是最典型的例子。

然而，耶稣同时也指出，这种“正过来”的价值体系最终的“结果”是暂时的：你现在笑，后来要哀哭；现在饱足，将来要饥饿。哪怕不从永恒来讲，只看今生，这也合乎常识：你若把自己的全部意义压在美貌上，美貌总会衰退；压在他人的爱上，他们终有一天会离开；压在成就与地位上，总有新人超过你、代替你。

而若真有永恒存在，你又执意把权势、安逸、成功、名望当作终极价值来建造自己的人生，那么当这个世界结束时，你现在的饱足终将变成永恒的空虚，你的欢笑终将变成无尽的哀哭。

也许你会问：耶稣凭什么说自己是对的？走出教会，环顾世界，“正过来的国度”看起来多么理所当然，谁会不想要这些？为什么要相信耶稣这一套颠倒的价值观？

有一位注释家给了一个很好的线索。他提到：耶稣下山时正在医病、赶鬼、喂饱饥饿的人，他说，这就像但以理书第五章里“墙上的字”——对旧国度的审判宣告。当年伯沙撒王知道玛代波斯王古列军队已经逼近，却仍在宫中大摆筵席、喝酒作乐、带妃嫔同乐。就在宴乐之中，墙上出现神秘的手，写下一行字，宣告他的国度已经被数算、要结束了。

同样，当耶稣出现在历史中，医治病人、叫死人复活、喂饱饥饿、最后在十字架上舍己，这一切就成了旧国度终结的“墙上字迹”。如果你仍旧只为自己而活，把所有资源都花在自己身上，只在不开心时偶尔去趟教会，在社会中只跟自己“同层级”的人打交道，而不愿按耶稣的样式去爱、去舍己，那么如果耶稣真是历史中的那位主，他的生命和十字架就成了对你整套生活方式的审判：你的国快要终结了。

因此，你必须先回答这个问题：耶稣是不是那位真实存在、死而复活的主？若是，他所活出的样式就意味着：那种只为自己、急于往上爬、只追逐成功与享乐、对贫穷人只是顺手给点“零头”的生活，终究站立不住。耶稣作为贫穷人来到世上，骑着借来的驴进城，在借来的楼房中吃最后的晚餐，死后也被葬在借来的坟墓里——他放弃了一切，却带着神的能力而来；这就是对旧国度的“警告字迹”。

接着我们看“颠倒的国度”。正如一位解经家迈克尔·威尔考克所说：在神子民的生命中，首先会看见的是价值观的惊人翻转；神的百姓会把世界认为可怜的事情看为宝贵，也会对世界认为可羡慕的东西持保留态度。换句话说，成为基督徒的一个标志，就是价值观被翻转过来：世界觉得可怜、失败的事，我们却在其中看到宝贵；世界极力追逐的东西，我们不再把它当作终极。

这并不意味着我们要“追求”贫穷、饥饿、眼泪与排斥，好像刻意去寻找痛苦本身。那样其实还是被旧国度的价值观捆绑，只不过是另一种形式而已。这里说的“看为宝贵”，是指当这些事情临到时，我们能看见它们在生命中所起的作用，不再立刻认定“人生毁了”。

若你一遇到软弱、失败、被排斥，就立刻说：“完了，我的生命完蛋了”，那说明你仍然活在旧国度的影响下。相反，当这些事临到时，基督徒会相信：神在其中有工作，神的国正在借此临近；同时，我们也会看重那些正在经历痛苦的人，愿意走进他们的生命，陪伴、安慰、扶持。

耶稣在这里给出的颠倒模式，是：一个人的“有福”不再取决于当下的处境，而是取决于他在神面前的地位。于是，一个正在哀哭的人仍可被称为“有福的”；一个被排斥的人仍可欢喜跳跃，因为他在天上的赏赐是大的。这里的“赏赐在天上是大的”，并不是“以后才有”，而是现在已经真实存在；这就像司提反在殉道时举目望见天开，看见荣耀的基督站在神右边，从而得着面对不公与逼迫的勇气和爱心。

因此，颠倒国度的“能力”，并非来自耶稣只是一个榜样，而是来自福音：他不只是“为了别人”受苦，更是“代替你”受苦，与你交换了位置。他承担了你应得的宇宙之哭，所以你可以在哀哭中仍然被称为“有福的”；他经历了你应得的被弃绝，所以你即使被人排斥，仍然在神那里被完全接纳。这种被完全接纳、完全爱的确据，就是你活出颠倒价值观的动力。

这也意味着，你在神面前必须是“灵里贫穷”的人：承认自己在神面前一无可夸，全靠耶稣的恩典；而不是“灵里中产阶级”，觉得自己还算不错，神多少欠我一点好处。前一种态度才会让你不断回到十字架前，从那里汲取力量，去过一个在世人看来“有点鲁莽”的慷慨生活：慷慨地用钱，也慷慨地付出时间与情感，哪怕会被利用、被误解。

当坏事临到时，活在颠倒国度里的基督徒不会马上说“生命失去意义了”，而是会想：也许正是现在，神的国度要在我和他人的生命中推进。回头看你自己的生命，你何时真正认识自己？何时与神最靠近？往往不是在富足、快乐、被欢迎的时候，而是在软弱、眼泪、孤单中。

因此，耶稣一开头就说：“你们贫穷的人有福了。”路加只写“贫穷”，马太则写“虚心的人有福了”（就是灵里贫穷）。这并不是矛盾，而是有意留下的张力：福音特别容易被穷人明白，因为他们最知道一切都是恩典；同时，福音也会去改变中产者、富人的心，使他们转向贫穷人，与他们为友，不再只和“同层级”的人在一起。

从你“与谁交往”这一点上，就可以看出你是否真正理解福音：你是否只和跟你差不多学历、收入、地位的人做朋友？还是承认“我所有的一切都是恩典”，因此乐意跨阶层地去爱别人？

总之，耶稣的到来已经在墙上写下字——旧国度的日子所剩无几。你必须问自己一个非常简单却严肃的问题：我是按世界的价值被牵着走，还是按基督的样式来生活？只有当你相信他已经为你“交换了位置”，你才有能力走进这个“颠倒的国度”，在世上活出真正的基督徒生命。

欢迎收听 “Gospel in Life”（福音在生活中）。本月在播客里，我们为大家带来一系列关于《登山宝训》的讲道。那是一组教导，耶稣在其中勾勒出真正过基督徒生活意味着什么。在这一系列里，提姆·凯勒探讨了一个非常震撼的思想：基督教不仅与这个世界不同，而且也与“宗教”本身有着根本性的不同。

耶稣和他们一同下了山，站在一块平地上。他的门徒有许多人在那里，还有许多百姓从犹大全地、耶路撒冷，以及推罗、西顿的沿海地带来聚集，他们来是要听他讲道，并且得医治自己的病症。

被污鬼缠扰的人也得了医治，众人都想要摸他，因为有能力从他身上出来，医好他们众人。

“你们贫穷的人有福了，因为神的国是你们的。
你们现在饥饿的人有福了，因为你们将要得饱足。
你们现在哀哭的人有福了，因为你们将要喜笑。
人为人子恨恶你们、拒绝你们、辱骂你们、弃掉你们的名，以为是恶，你们就有福了。

当那日，你们要欢喜跳跃，因为你们在天上的赏赐是大的。他们的祖宗待先知也是这样。
但你们富足的人有祸了，因为你们已经享受过你们的安慰。
你们饱足的人有祸了，因为你们将要饥饿。
你们现在喜笑的人有祸了，因为你们将要哀恸哭泣。
人都说你们好的时候，你们就有祸了，因为他们的祖宗待假先知也是这样。”

这就是神的话。

正如提姆刚才所说，现在是春天，在教会里，几个世纪以来在这个季节有一个传统：在春天的时候，转而思想“过基督徒生活意味着什么”。你看，复活节就在眼前，当你来到复活节、庆祝主复活的时候，很自然就会开始问一个问题：我们怎样才能活在新生命中？我们怎样活出复活的生命？过基督徒的生活到底是什么意思？

圣经里有三四处经典经文，能极为生动地告诉我们，真正作为一个基督徒活在这个世界上是怎样的景象。其中一处就是《登山宝训》。

从现在开始，一直到夏天伊始，我们都会查考《登山宝训》，正是出于这个缘故。现在我们手中有《登山宝训》的记载——准确地说，是有两次耶稣讲这篇道的记载。他不止一次讲过这篇讲道，这段讲论被他在不同场合多次传讲。

在路加福音第 6 章，我们有一段相对较短的版本；换句话说，那一次他在讲的时候，内容没有马太福音 5–7 章那次那么长。马太那里的记载更为详细、篇幅更长。

有一件事很有意思：这两次讲道都与山联系在一起。马太福音 5 章 1 节说：他“上了山”。在这里你看第 17 节怎么说？这里说他“下了山”，那么他之前在哪里呢？他原本是在山坡上，同他的门徒在一起教导他们。

为什么要和“山”联系在一起？

据我们所知，耶稣是在加利利海以北、海面之上的群山里讲这篇道的。加利利海北面的群山，起的作用与历史上许多地方的山岭是一样的。如果你是个革命者，想要带来一个新王国、一个新政权，同时你也被人追捕，被追赶，那么你通常会怎么做？你一般会躲到山里去。如果你是革命者，你会藏身山中。

这也是为什么那些革命者要躲在威尔士的山里——在威尔士北部的山区，那是他们藏身的地方。那些试图建立威尔士王国、推翻英格兰统治的人，就在那里隐匿。各地都是如此：革命者往山里藏。

因此，耶稣基督上山，是因为他在带来一场革命。他是在从事一项“颠覆性”活动。他实际上在他讲道一开始，在第 20 节就说了：他要来带来一个新政权，他要来带来一个国度，一个新的国度来取代旧有的国度。

然而，当你真正开始明白他所说的这个“国度”是什么的时候，你就会意识到：历史上所有其他的革命者，其实都只是试图对旧王国做一些微调，做一点修修补补、洗牌重组而已。

而耶稣基督所带来的革命却是最为激进、最为彻底的，因为他这国度的价值观、运行方式、能力来源，以及它所结出的果子，都与众不同，完全另一个体系。

你看，什么是“国度”？我刚才已经提到过，任何一个“国度”至少都有三样东西。

第一，一个国度一定有一套“模式”（pattern）——也就是一整套价值观。无论是一位国王、一个新政府，还是一个新的管理层，只要他们上任，一定会带来一套新的价值取向。如果一位新教练接手一支球队，他一上任就会说：“体能训练很重要。我知道上一任教练不太看重体能，但我很看重体能。”

换句话说，只要是一个新的王国、一套新的管理、新的制度，就必然会带来一组新的价值观——一套“模式”。

第二，一个国度一定有把这套价值模式“落实”出来的能力（power）。

第三，总有一个“结果”（product）。当这套模式借着能力被执行出来的时候，它一定会在人的生命里产生某种影响。在球队里，你最后会看到：如果这位教练真正掌权，并且把他那一整套计划彻底执行，那么球队会不会赢球？队员能不能发挥出潜力？全队的士气会不会提升？究竟会发生什么？

所以，一个国度总会有影响，总会带来改变。它会有一套模式，有落实现实的能力，最后也会在人的生命中结出某种结果。

在第 20–23 节里，耶稣向我们展示的是他这国度的“模式”、“能力”和“结果”。而在 24–26 节，他则展示了那个被他取代的旧国度——那是一个完全不同的模式、完全不同的能力运作方式、完全不同的一整套结果。

我们要在这里做的，其实就是一个总览——相当于为他在《登山宝训》中接下来所有要说的话做一个引言：我们要来看这两个国度。说到底，其实只有这两种国度。而你必须时刻记住的一点是：你只能属于其中一个国度，不可能两者都属于。

保罗在歌罗西书 1 章 13 节说：“他救了我们脱离黑暗的权势，把我们迁到他爱子的国里。”所以，你要么是一个国度的公民，要么是另一个国度的公民。但还有一点你要记得：就算你已经是基督国度的子民，我们仍然……（未完待续）

在罗马书里有一段非常有意思的话，保罗说：“黑夜已深，白昼将近，所以我们就当行事为人端正，好像行在白昼。”（意译）保罗在说什么？这点对我们非常重要——他在说，在整个救赎历史中，我们现在所处的属灵时段，就好像“黎明”。

“白昼将近”，意味着光正在临到；“黑夜已深”，意味着黑暗正在退去。两件事同时发生。现在既不是完全的白天，也不是完全的黑夜。如果你经历过清晨黎明，你就知道，那其实是“光与暗交叠”的时刻：白天在到来，黑夜在退去，两者都还在场。

保罗说，你必须确保自己“好像行在白昼”那样生活——你要穿衣打扮、整装预备，就好像光已经完全照亮了一样，因为那光确实要来到。不要被黑暗迷惑。 

这就意味着：即便你已经是耶稣基督国度的子民，你仍然可能活在旧王国的影响之下。所以，要真正明白的不仅是“有两个国度”这个事实，更是要弄清楚这两个国度各自的“模式”（pattern）是什么——这对你在这个世界里如何以基督徒的身份生活至关重要。

那么，这两个国度分别是什么？

我们会先简短地看第一个——那个被基督的国所取代的“旧国度”；然后再稍微更详细地看第二个——新的国度。我会把第一个称为“正向的国度（right-side-up kingdom）”，把第二个称为“颠倒的国度（upside-down kingdom）”。

为什么这样叫呢？先看第一个：所谓“正向的国度”。

我一会儿会解释为什么叫它“正向”，但你可以先看到：任何一个国度，都会把某些东西放在“上面”，把另外一些东西放在“下面”。总会有一组是你说“这些是好的，是优先级，是我们追求的”；也会有另一组是你说“这些不太好，是我们要躲避、要远离的”。

在被基督替换掉的那个国度里——也就是 24–26 节所勾勒出的那个国度——情形就是这样：

什么被放在“最上面”？哪些是被高度看重的价值？

权力（power）、舒适（comfort）、成功（success）、名誉与认可（recognition）。

首先是权力。经文里说的是“富足的人”，但你知道，财富与贫穷其实本质上是一个“权力”的问题。谁掌握资源，谁就掌握权力。

其次是“吃饱的人”——这指向的是物质的舒适：漂亮的衣服、高级的餐厅、漂亮的房子等等。这就是“舒适”。

第三，“喜笑的人”。这里“喜笑”的那个希腊词带有负面的语气，语言学家会告诉你，这个词更接近于“幸灾乐祸的笑，得意的笑”。就像你赢得大选当天的庆功夜会——“我赢了，他们输了！”所以，这里不只是指一般的快乐，而是指一种“胜利者的狂欢”，是“成功”本身：你升职之后办的庆祝会，你打败对手后办的派对，诸如此类。

最后是“人人都说你们好的时候”——那就是被认可、被称赞、走红、成名，被人仰望、追捧。

这些，就是基督所要取代的那个国度所推崇的价值：权力、舒适、成功、名誉。

当然，你也能看到与之相反的东西——就是这个国度要压下去、躲避、轻视、甚至嘲笑的那些：20–23 节里提到的是什么？

简单说，就是“软弱”（weakness）、“牺牲”（sacrifice）、“不舒适 / 受苦”（discomfort / grief）、“被排斥”（exclusion）。

换一种说法，就是软弱、牺牲、忧伤、被排除在外。你被排斥、你在哭泣。

于是，这个国度的逻辑就成了：

——“我们要追求的是权力、舒适、成功、名声；
——对软弱、悲伤、牺牲、被排斥怎么办？我们会尽一切可能去避免这些东西。”

现在，为什么称它为“正向的国度”？并不是从神的角度说它是“正”的，而是从我们的角度看，它似乎完全“顺理成章”，好像就该是这样。“把这些东西放在上面”看起来再自然不过。

这是因为，这个国度背后真正的驱动力，是“当下”的力量（the power of the now）。

你细看 24–26 节，会发现经文反复提到：财富、权势、成功、舒适，都是“现在”的事——“你们现在饱足……你们现在喜笑……”。

如果你把成功当成终极目标，如果你把权势当成终极目标，如果你把快乐、避免痛苦当成终极目标，如果你把被认可、被称赞当成终极目标——你会发现，这些东西“现在”确实给你带来回报，立竿见影。

如果“当下”才是唯一真实的；如果对大部分人来说，过去已经过去，未来谁也不知道，那剩下的就只剩“此刻”。如果这一切的世界就是全部，如果没有别的维度、没有永恒——那么，这整套价值体系看起来就再自然不过：绝对自然。

它在“生物学”上显得很自然。你听说过“进化论”吗？听说过“生存下来的总是软弱的、被拒绝的、不断舍己牺牲的”吗？当然没听说过。你听到的是什么？“适者生存”，强者存活。 

所以，从生物学角度看，说“追求权力、舒适、成功、名望”似乎非常自然；从心理学角度看，也似乎非常自然。

我看到过英国一位相当有名的精神科医生的一段话，他说：

“在我看来，弥漫在基督教里的那种精神，本质上是自虐（masochism）。而这种自虐精神最强烈的表达，就出现在基督在登山宝训里的教导：他宣告贫穷的人、有亏损的人、被逼迫的人有福；他叫我们去善待恨我们的人，去赦免别人对我们的冒犯；这一切，都在滋长一种自虐倾向。”

你看，在“正向的国度”的视角里，这些以软弱、牺牲、哀哭、被排斥为“有福”的说法，听起来就好像一种反人性的自虐。生物学上不自然，心理学上也不自然。谁会把软弱当成宝贵？谁会看重牺牲？谁会珍视哀伤？谁会重视被拒绝、被排斥？

所以，我们顺理成章地觉得：当然要把“权力、舒适、成功、名誉”摆在最上面。

那这套国度最终的“结果”（product）是什么？

耶稣接着说：

——如果你按着这套价值观去活，被“当下”的力量所驱动——因为它确实“现在就见效”——那么，你得到的结果也只会停留在“现在”。

他怎么说？

你“现在”喜笑，将来要哀哭；
你“现在”饱足，将来要饥饿。

他在说的是一个非常朴素的常识：

如果你说：“我只在乎现在；谁知道有没有永恒？谁知道有没有别的世界？我只管当下。”

那么，你的人生就会建立在“当下”之上，你也的确会在“当下”得到一些东西——可是，事实很简单：这些东西终究是要崩塌的。

如果你把生命建在自己的美貌上、建在自己所拥有的荣耀和光环上——你的美貌总有一天会逝去，你的光环也总有一天会褪色；
如果你把生命建在财富、地位、人脉或任何“当下的资本”上——这些东西要么会离开你，要么你会离开它们。

所以，耶稣说：“那只是暂时的。”

你可以在“现在”得到笑声，但最后会是一场大哭；
你可以在“现在”填满自己的胃和内心的欲望，但最后会发现里面是空的。

这就是这个“正向国度”最终的产品：一种暂时的满足，换来最终的空虚与崩塌。下一步，耶稣就要转向另一种全然不同的国度——一个在我们看来自相矛盾、实则倒转过来的国度。

如果你把生命建在自己的外貌上，你的容颜终究会衰退；
如果你把生命建在那些爱你的人身上，他们终有一天会离开这个世界；
如果你把生命建在成就和权力上，你的纪录终有一天会被别人打破。

而且，如果“现在”并不是全部，如果真有一个永恒的世界存在——那么，一个把生命完全建在此时此地的权力、舒适、成功和名声之上的人，如果把这些当作最终的底线和终极价值，而这个世界又并非全部，那么，耶稣就说：你现在的“饱足”，最终将变成宇宙层面的空虚；你现在的“欢笑”，最终将变成宇宙层面的哀哭与痛悔。

有人会说，这是个好问题：“我们怎么知道耶稣说的是对的？”

你走进现实世界，就会发现所谓这个“正向国度”（right-side-up kingdom）为什么看起来那么理所当然。我之所以这样称呼它，是因为在日常经验中，重视这些东西（权力、舒适、成功、认同）看起来“再正常不过”。任何别的选择，似乎都像是自杀。

——谁会把软弱当作价值？
——谁会看重牺牲？
——谁会拥抱眼泪？

走出教会的门，环顾四周，这样的选择完全说不通。所以耶稣在这里讲的，简直是和我们所有的直觉、信念都对着干。那么，为什么我们要相信他？

答案在这里。

我记得有一次，我在读一本关于这段经文的释经书，是一本很好的注释书。作者提到：耶稣从山上下来，开始医治、开始喂饱人群——有能力从他身上出去，行出神迹。然后，这位作者写了一句很短的话：“这是写在墙上的字（The handwriting is on the wall）——参看《但以理书》第五章。”

有些注释书实在太精炼了，以至于你得停住仔细想一想。“写在墙上的字”是什么意思？耶稣从山上下来，但以理书第五章又关什么事？

原来是这样：在《但以理书》第五章里，有一个人叫伯沙撒，是巴比伦帝国的末代王。当时波斯王居鲁士的军队已经逼近城下，他知道自己不可能打赢，也知道自己的帝国快要垮台了。于是他做了什么？他办了一场巨大的宴会。

他们喝得酩酊大醉，他把妃嫔们都召进来。读那章经文时我才意识到，有一幕是“从来不会发生的”：按当时的惯例，你不会把妃嫔和妻子们一起带进宴会——那会被当作极其失礼、淫乱的举动。但在那天晚上，一切规矩全被抛在脑后，妃嫔们也进来了，现场成了一场疯狂的宴饮。

就在这时，墙上出现了一只手，开始写字——写下的意思就是：你的日子已经数算尽了。

当耶稣基督出现，在地上开始医治病人、叫死人复活、喂饱饥饿的人、最后钉死在十字架上的时候——那就是为旧国度、旧生活方式写在墙上的那行字。

如果你仍然只为自己而活，如果你把所有的钱都花在自己身上，如果你的生活与耶稣基督的生活方式毫无相似之处——而耶稣如果真的来过、真的行过这些神迹——那就意味着你此刻就像伯沙撒一样，在举办一场盛大的宴会，而你的国度其实已经岌岌可危、摇摇欲坠。

墙上的字已经写好了。

当我读懂那位注释作者的意思时，真的是背脊一凉。他在说的是：你必须问自己——

到底有没有这么一位耶稣基督？
他是不是真的过过圣经所形容的那种生活？

如果答案是“是”，那么这就意味着：
所有那种“为自己而活、只管往上爬、只追求成功、偶尔施舍一些给穷人、只有在心情不好时才去教会、只和同层级的人相处”的那整套生活方式，就像伯沙撒的国度一样，已经到了“墙上写字”的时刻。

那整套看起来“完全合理”的正向国度——靠着权力、舒适、成功、名声活着——因为耶稣基督曾过过那样一个完全不同的生命，而实际上已被宣判终局。

他摸那些长大麻风的人，他把自己给穷人，他以贫穷人的身份来到这个世界；
他骑着一头借来的小驴进入城；
他在一间借来的楼上吃最后的晚餐；
他被葬在一座借来的坟墓里；
他放弃一切，带着从神来的权柄降临。

这一切，正是写在旧国度墙上的那一行字：
凡不按着他那种生命样式活的人，终究要面对这结局。

当然，有人会说：“我不确定耶稣是不是真的存在过，我不确定他有没有行过这些神迹。”——那你就需要去认真查考，那是另外一篇讲道要做的事，不是我们今天的主题。今天我不会带你细看所有文本，也不会逐条摆出证据。

但如果他确实存在过，如果他真的如圣经所记载那样生活、那样死去、那样复活——那么，如果你不愿意过一种“与这个世界的方式完全相反”的生活，你就跟伯沙撒一样，日子已经被数算完了。

接下来，我们要看的是“颠倒的国度”。刚才讲的是“正向的国度”，那么，“颠倒的国度”是什么？

我刚才已经部分说明了，但让我引用一位对我帮助很大的解经家——迈克尔·威尔科克（Michael Wilcock）在他写的路加福音注释中的一句话，他这样总结这一段：

“在神子民的生命中，人们将首先看见的是一种惊人的‘价值反转’。神的子民会把世人所怜悯、觉得可怜的事当作宝贵；会对世人所渴望的东西保持警觉与怀疑。”

换句话说，什么标志着一个人是真正的基督徒？

——是一场价值观的翻转。

世界认为“可怜、悲惨”的那些事，我们却珍视其所带来的属灵价值；
世界疯狂追逐、觉得“太棒了”的那些东西，我们却会本能地提高警觉。

他接着说：

“我们会珍视（prize）软弱、牺牲、忧伤和被排斥。”

于是问题来了：

我们是不是就真像那位精神科医生所说，是在搞一种“自虐”？答案是否定的。

“珍视”（prize）和“刻意追求”（seek）并不是一回事。

事实上，如果你“刻意去追求”这些东西（比如刻意让自己受苦、刻意让自己被拒绝），我可以很快就指出，你其实仍然是被旧世界那一套价值观所支配，只不过换了一种宗教版的形式。

我们在这里所说的“珍视”，意思是：当这些事情临到你时，你看得见它的价值；当它发生时，你明白神在你生命中通过这些在做什么；当它临到时，你不会说：“完了完了，我的人生结束了。”

如果当软弱来临、艰难临到、流泪的日子来到，你的第一反应总是：“糟了，我的人生毁了。”——那就说明，你仍然深受旧世界那一套国度的影响，仍然站在那已经被写上审判之字的王国之下。

在“颠倒国度”里，我们会在这些事发生时，看见它们的价值；我们也会珍视那些正在经历这些的人，我们会被他们吸引，走进他们的生命，尽力减轻他们的重担，与他们一同走过。

现在，让我们回到提姆·凯勒今天讲道剩下的部分。

——

现在让我把它拆开来讲：我们要来看“颠倒国度”的三方面：它的模式（pattern）、能力（power）和结果（product）。

一、模式：对世界的“价值反转”

所谓“颠倒国度”的模式，就是对这个世界价值观的一种反转。换句话说，基督徒不再被这个世界视为极其关键的那些东西所控制——我们不再被权力、成功所支配，不再被舒适、认可所驱动。

我们不再受它们控制。

让我从另一个角度说明一下：

如果你“受不了”这些东西，如果你一看见就要逃开，如果你完全不会处理财富，如果你不知道该如何面对名声，如果你一见到有权有势的人就本能地想要躲得远远的——如果你总是在逃避这些东西，那其实说明你仍然被它们控制。

你是被它们吓住了。很可能在你内心深处，你依然被它们震慑，甚至依然渴望它们，只是用一种“逃离”的方式表现出来而已。

但一个真正活在“颠倒国度”里的基督徒，不再被这些所控制。他不需要它们，所以也不会被它们牵着走。它们不再是驱动他的底线，也不再是抓住他心的东西——因此，他可以拿得起，也可以放得下。

这是一个活在“颠倒国度”中的人生命模式的第一个标记。

举个例子：

设想现在有两个人站在一起——

与其直接说“一个是基督徒，一个不是基督徒”，我们不如这样说：一个是被“正向国度”的价值观所支配的人，一个是被“颠倒国度”所支配的人。

他们恰巧都处在同样的职场处境里：

如果他们说真话，就要丢掉工作。

你看，被“旧国度”支配的人，会被迫说谎。他是个奴隶，不得不说谎。为什么？

因为他不能没有那栋带花岗岩台面的房子；
他不能没有权力和舒适；
他不能没有成功。 

他离不开这些，所以就只能妥协。

但一个活在“颠倒国度”里的基督徒会说：
“我必须照真理行事，我必须按照该做的去做。”

因为这些东西——房子、地位、舒适——已经不再是左右他生命的那一位了。

那么，这样的自由从哪里来？

经文里有两个非常悖论式的表达，正好点明了这里的动力秘密。

首先，你留意耶稣整段话里的这个结构：“现在哀哭的人有福了。”“现在饥饿的人有福了。”

你看到这悖论了吗？

一方面，你“现在在哭”；
另一方面，你“有福”。

“有福”这个词在原文里，就是“深深得满足”的意思。耶稣在说：

一个基督徒是这样的人——可以一边哭，一边仍然是“有福的”。

在旧国度里，如果你失业了、失去所爱的人、失去名声——“有福”和“喜乐”是跟“成功”绑在一起的，绝不可能和“哭泣”同时存在。

但在新国度里，“有福”和“哭泣”可以同时存在——因为这里讲的“有福”，不再是以环境为前提。

另一处更清楚地显出这种悖论的，是第 23 节：

“当那日，你们要欢喜跳跃，因为你们在天上的赏赐是大的。”

卡尔·马克思曾经看见类似的经文，就说：“这就是我讨厌基督教的地方——它是‘人民的鸦片’。”

在他看来，“因为你们在天上的赏赐是大的”这类话的意思就是：

——“好吧，我就忍着现实中的不公，不去对抗不义，不去争取改变；反正将来在某个虚无缥缈的地方，我会得到一个‘天上的好处’。”

他理解成：“现在不要指望未来，这一生没指望，就等着‘天上的馅饼’吧。”

但这不是这节经文在说的。

你看清楚经文说什么：

“当那日，你们要欢喜跳跃。”

哪一日？不是末日审判的那日，而是第 22 节提到的那一日：

“人为人子恨恶你们、拒绝你们、辱骂你们、弃掉你们的名，以为是恶”的那一日。

也就是说，这里的意思是：就在你被排斥、被拒绝、被污蔑的那一天——“当那日”，你就可以欢喜跳跃，因为“你们在天上的赏赐是大的”。

注意，这里原文的语气并不只是“将来会有赏赐”，而是：此刻，你已经在天上拥有这赏赐。你的生命真实地“藏在天上”。

这正是歌罗西书第三章和使徒行传第七章所讲的。

我一直无法忘记《使徒行传》第七章的画面：

司提反即将被石头打死，被公会判处死刑。我常常问自己：

——他怎么能如此勇敢？
——他怎么能在这么不公的审判中，仍然充满爱，不被恐惧吞噬，也不被愤怒掌控？

经文说：他“定睛望天”，说：“我看见神的荣耀，也看见耶稣站在神的右边。”

换句话说，他意识到：

在地上，这一场“袋鼠法庭”正在对他行严重的不义；
但在神面前，他已被完全平反、完全接纳。

歌罗西书 3 章 1 节说：

“你们要思念上面的事，不要思念地上的事……因为你们已经死了，你们的生命与基督一同藏在神里面。”（意译）

一个基督徒就是这样的人：

当他说：“我在地上失去了名声，但在神那里，我是被认识、被记念的；
我在地上被拒绝，但在神那里，我被欢迎、被拥抱。”

这就是“又哭、又蒙福”；
这是“被排斥，却能欢喜跳跃”。

也正因为如此，一个属于“颠倒国度”的人，可以在失去世上的认同时仍然稳固；在遭受排斥时仍然喜乐。——因为他看见了另一个更真实的世界：在那里，他已经被接纳、被尊荣、被称义。

因此，他可以诚实、不必被恐惧和愤怒驱使；
他可以忠心，而不必紧紧抓牢那些迟早会失去的东西。

这，就是“颠倒国度”的动力所在。接下来经文会继续展开，这样的动力如何实际塑造我们面对权力、财富、苦难和荣耀的方式……（未完待续）

正因为你在基督里已经拥有那样的地位与福分，你就不再被这个世界的价值观所奴役——那些东西不再能控制你。你开始活在一种真正自由的生命样式中。这就是那“反转”的生命。

在往下讲之前，先说两点很实际的应用。

第一，你看，这就意味着：卡尔·马克思其实完全误解了这一切。如果这个世界真的是一切、如果没有别的世界存在，那么，为了抗争不公而失去工作、失去名声、甚至失去生命，当然就“不值得”，我们也自然不会这么做。

但如果我已经拥有一种“有福”的状态，如果我真的可以“欢喜跳跃”，因为此刻就站在天上的地位中——如果我真切地看见自己在天上的身份——那么，我就能说：

我当然可以为反对不义付上代价。 

如果我在社区里看见不公，我站出来；就算因此被排斥又如何？
如果我在公司里看见不义，我吹哨揭露；就算因此丢掉工作又如何？

你问：“真的有人这样活吗？”

如果你有足够资源活出这样的正直与勇气——那正是“颠倒国度”的能力所在。这绝不是“人民的鸦片”，而更像是“让人惊醒的嗅盐”（smelling salts）：它不麻醉你，反而把你从沉睡中叫醒。

第二，这也意味着：你既不需要“硬要拥有这些东西”，也不需要“硬要一个都没有”。正如我刚才提到的——你既不必死抱着这些东西不放，也不必在被拿走时苦毒万分。

这就是那模式：我因从世界的价值中得自由，而活出一整套完全反转的生命样式。

二、能力：这力量从哪来？

你可能会说：“好，我明白这种生命很美，但我做不到。这样的勇气从哪来？”

经文已经给出答案了，就在第 19 节：“有能力从他身上出来，医好了他们众人。”

耶稣基督的生命，本身就是我们该活出来的那条道路的榜样——他明明是王，却以贫穷者的身份来到世上。 

他在这里说：“如果你被排斥，如果你被拒绝，如果你在世人的标准下是个‘失败者’，不要惊讶，不要难过——因为先知们历世历代都是如此。”

他说：“你听说过哪个‘成功的先知’吗？听说过哪个‘特别快乐、被万人拥戴的先知’吗？”

自然没有。先知总是在边缘、在被拒绝的位置上。

耶稣的意思是：如果这些都是真先知的写照，那当真正的“那一位大先知”——真正的王——来到时，他会如何？

你在福音书里看到的，就是这样的耶稣：

他变得贫穷；
他被完全弃绝；
最后在十字架上，他不仅被门徒和群众弃绝，甚至在某种意义上被天父“离弃”。

他把自己完全给了出去。

你可能会说：“对，我明白，这是一个榜样。我们应该效法他。”

但如果耶稣只是来给你一个“反转价值观”的榜样，他对你其实毫无能力，只会变成一个重担。

你只会说：“天哪，我应该这么慷慨；我应该这么舍己……可我做不到。”

如果他只是个榜样，你只会越看越羞愧，而不会得到任何力量。

福音不是这样。福音不是单纯看见耶稣“为别人变得软弱、为别人变得贫穷”。你必须看见的是：他所做的一切，都是为了与你“交换命运”。

他之所以能说：“你们现在哭泣，将来必大大欢喜”，是因为他替你承担了你本该承受的那种“宇宙性的哭泣”。他在十字架上死在黑暗之中。

他之所以能说：“你们必得安慰”，是因为他曾经经历了彻底无安慰的撕裂——被完全抛弃。

他之所以能说：“你们必得饱足”，是因为他在十字架上经历了彻底的干渴与空虚。

他为什么能说这些？

因为在十字架上，他与你完成了一次“命运的对调”：

他把你放在他本应站立的地方——在神宝座前，被接纳、被爱、被悦纳；
他自己则走进你本该去到的地方——被弃绝、被掩面不顾、被扔在外面。

正是因为这一次“交换”，你才拥有真正的能力。

这就是为什么耶稣可以转过来对门徒说：“你们贫穷的人有福了。”

注意，19–20 节说，他“举目看着门徒，说：‘你们贫穷的人有福了’。”门徒中确实有些人是物质上的穷人，但也有像马太那样做税吏的，他显然不穷。

那他怎么可以对所有门徒都这样说？

答案是：

要真正领受这能力，你必须在灵里成为一个“贫穷的人”（poor in spirit）。

面对神，大致有两种完全不同的心态：

第一种心态是：
“在神面前，我拿不出任何能换取他恩典的东西。神什么都不欠我；按公义，他完全可以割断我与他的一切关系。我要完全倚靠耶稣为我所做的一切，求神按着基督的功劳接纳我。”

第二种心态是：
“我这一生还算过得不错，我挺努力，品行也不差。神多少应该‘欠我一点’。他至少不该让坏事发生在我身上，他应该给我一些安慰、一些好处。”

第一种，就是“心灵贫穷”；
第二种，就是“心灵中产阶级”（middle class in spirit）。

所谓“心灵中产阶级”，就是旧国度的典型逻辑：

“我努力工作，我尽了本分，我完成了责任，所以神至少应该对我好一点。他不该让太糟糕的事发生在我身上。”

如果这是你内心深处的模式，那么你看耶稣最多只会把他当作“榜样”——而不会真正看见他是你的“代替者”。

你也就无法真正体验那种从“命运交换”而来的能力——那种因他替你承担一切而产生的勇气。

但一旦你真知道自己在天上的地位——知道他已经替你反转了一切，你就会开始“鲁莽地”活在这个世界上。

所谓“鲁莽地”（recklessly），不是毫无智慧，而是：

你不会一分钱都不肯放手，但也不会把钱全部抓紧不放。

如果你真活在这“颠倒的国度”里，你会慷慨到一种程度：在金钱上，你会让自己承受某种程度的“风险”；你会在奉献和帮助他人上慷慨到一个地步，好像让自己的财务处境变得略显“不那么安全”。

同时，你在人际关系、时间与精力上也会如此——你会活得不像是把这一生当作一切，而更像是已经拥有了一个更真实、更稳固的未来；因此，你可以认真地去爱人、去舍己，而不必时时为“自己的安全感”算计。

这，就是耶稣所描绘的“颠倒国度”：

一个在世人眼里看上去“有点不理性”、甚至“有点冒失”的国度；
却是建立在一个极其稳固、永恒的现实之上——那就是基督已经为你完成的“命运反转”。

（本讲到在后文还会继续展开，这里先告一段落。）

当你按着这样的能力去活时，你会发现：有时候，人会在情感上“利用”你；当你把心敞开去爱人时，有时会被人误用或误解。

当你投入时间、精力，去帮助别人和好、调解关系时，有时反倒会有人迁怒于你。世界会说：“太不值得了！你干嘛把自己弄得这么累、这么受委屈？”

可基督徒会说：

“钱，当然有比没有好；
隐私，当然拥有一些空间是好的；
舒适，当然令人愉快；
但因为我知道自己在基督面前是谁，所以我要照着他的样子去活，而不是被这些东西所控制。”

正因如此，基督徒愿意走出去，以一种在世人看来近乎“鲁莽”的方式生活——不是因为不负责任，而是因为“心灵贫穷”，而不是“心灵中产阶级”。

同样，当坏事临到你时，这套视角也会完全不同。

活在旧国度里的人，遇到患难、挫折时往往说：“我的人生完了，我的生命没有意义了。”

但基督徒知道，当我贫穷、哭泣、里面空虚的时候，神的国往往近在咫尺。

这又是“颠倒国度”中那种“软弱即刚强、刚强即软弱”的表达方式之一。

老实说，你什么时候最深地认识自己？
什么时候最真实地遇见基督？
什么时候与你的神最紧密地连在一起？

通常不是在你富足、快乐、大笑、被人拥戴的时候，而恰恰是在相反的情境里。

因此，基督徒会愿意走上那条牺牲之路。我说“鲁莽”，不是指不负责任，而是从世人的角度看起来“有点冒险”：

世人会说：“谁会捐那么多钱？你得为自己准备‘雨天基金’啊！”
世人会说：“谁会把生命这样给出去？你迟早会被人利用的。”

可是，一个在基督里得着力量的信徒，在世人眼中就会显得“有点鲁莽”：

他不会惧怕流泪；
不会惧怕空虚和牺牲；
因为他知道，正是在这些时刻，神的国在他生命里、也在他周围的人身上推进。

三、结果：这国度具体长成怎样的生命？

“颠倒国度”的模式，是对那些世界高度看重的东西——权力、舒适、成功、名声——的态度完全反转；
“颠倒国度”的能力，来自于那位为你“交换命运”的基督。

那它的结果呢？

为什么在这段经文里，路加简单地记为“你们贫穷的人有福了”，而马太福音 5 章却写成“虚心的人（心灵贫穷的人）有福了”？

许多人在这两处经文之间来回摇摆，不知道到底该怎么理解：

——耶稣是在说“只要心灵贫穷就好”吗？不必真的在物质上贫穷？
——还是在说“福音主要是给现实中穷人的”？

答案是：

这里其实刻意保留了一种“双重指向”的张力。

福音会把“中产心态”的人带进来，改变他们，使他们的心向着穷人柔软；
福音也会走近现实中的穷人，让他们的心向着整个基督身体敞开。

穷人往往更容易明白“救恩必须是恩典”这一点。你很少看到穷人说：“我靠自己的道德就够了。”

穷人更可能这样说：“我相信耶稣的宝血，我相信恩典得救。”

为什么？

因为他们没有那种“我掌控一切、我努力就一定有结果”的幻觉。他们更知道：很多事真的不在自己掌握之中，一切都是恩典。

因此，穷人往往对福音更敞开。与此同时，福音又会走到那些“过得还不错”的人那里，对他们说：

“你也是完全靠恩典得救的。”

然后，把他们的心转向穷人。

于是，我们在《登山宝训》里看到一个检验点：

如果你真的明白福音，
你与谁来往、与你同桌吃饭的人，会成为一项极重要的指标。

你是不是只和“与你同层级”的人来往？
你是不是只在乎和那些“成就与你相仿或比你高”的人做朋友？

还是你知道：

你之所以今天是现在的你，完全是因为神白白的恩典？

你周围的朋友是谁？
你愿意花时间和谁在一起？

这些都与一个基督徒的生活方式有极大的关系。

所以，结论是：

旧国度的墙上，已经写下了审判的字。

你必须问自己几个简单却严肃的问题：

——我活着，是不是仍然被这个世界的评价体系所控制？
——还是，我正在过一种像基督那样的生命？

我只有在承认“他已经站到了我的位置上，而我如今站在他的位置上”的前提下，才可能活出那样的生命。

我不希望你像伯沙撒那样——一边看着国度将倾，一边只会开更大的宴会、喝得更醉、跳得更疯。

我更希望你像尼布甲尼撒那样。

在《但以理书》中，尼布甲尼撒是伯沙撒之前的那位王。神在梦中向他显明：“我要把你砍下，你像一棵大树却要被伐倒；但有一天，你会再度发芽，只要你学会承认：一切成功都是不配得的恩典。”

后来他真的被击倒——读那段故事你会发现，他经历了一段极其痛苦的击打，甚至陷入一种精神崩溃的状态。但当他恢复过来时，他不像伯沙撒那样仍旧无动于衷，而是醒悟过来：

他一生原来都是按着旧国度的逻辑在活。

于是他站起来，承认说：“我如今知道，所有的一切都是出于神的恩典。”

从那之后，他行事的方式彻底改变了。

所以，不要做伯沙撒。要做尼布甲尼撒。

不要继续活在那个“正向国度”里，反而要进入耶稣所说的“颠倒国度”。

让我们一起祷告。

天父，我们求你赐给我们能力，把这道真正应用在生命中。对我们当中的一些人，这意味着要比以往慷慨得多；对另一些人，这意味着要重新思考：我们到底把时间花在谁身上？

这的确是一个广泛而全面的主题。我们祷告，求你在接下来的日子里，继续带领我们，把这一切拆解开来，让我们看清，这“颠倒国度”在我们生命每一个角落意味着什么。

但今天，我们先求你赐给我们谦卑的心——不要像伯沙撒那样，只是继续更疯狂地宴乐；而要像尼布甲尼撒那样，把眼目举向天。

求你使我们成为真正按着“颠倒国度”而活的人。借着你的圣灵，向我们显明这到底意味着什么。

奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。
