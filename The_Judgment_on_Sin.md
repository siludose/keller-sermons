Welcome to Gospel in Life. You don't have to look far to see that something's deeply  wrong with our world and with us. But is there an answer that gets to the root of why?  In today's message, Tim Keller explores the human condition through stories in the Bible,  uncovering what Scripture says about sin and why it's the only explanation deep enough  to face the truth about ourselves.  The teaching is based today as an print in your bulletinets, Exodus 17, verses 1 to 7.  An incident during the time that children of Israel are wandering in the wilderness and we read,  the whole Israelite community set out from the desert of sin traveling from place to place  as the Lord commanded. They camped at refidem but there was no water for the people to drink.  So they quarreled with Moses and said, give us water to drink. Moses replied,  why do you quarrele with me? Why do you put the Lord to the test? But the people were thirsty  for water there. And they grumbled against Moses. They said, why did you bring us up out of Egypt to  make us and our children and livestock die of thirst? Then Moses cried out to the Lord,  what am I to do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me. The Lord answered Moses,  walk on ahead of the people, take with you some of the elders of Israel and take in your hand the  staff with which you struck the Nile and go, I will stand there before you by the rock at horub,  strike the rock and the water will come out of it for the people to drink. So Moses did this  in the sight of the elders of Israel and he called the place Masa and Meraba because the Israelites  quarreled and because they tested the Lord saying, is the Lord among us or not? This is God's word.  You know, April and May this year marked the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the death  camps in Germany just before the end of World War II and the US News and World Report last week or  this week, had a large cover story consisting largely of the reports of eyewitnesses, the GIs,  American GIs who still are alive, the reports of those eyewitnesses when they liberated those camps.  And I thought I knew a lot about the subject but reading that was just devastating.  Here are these guys, GIs, that they were battle-hardened. They fought the way across Europe  and yet when they saw what they saw, they vomited. And they took pictures saying nobody will  believe this. That's one of the reasons why we've got the evidence we've got. And the witnesses ask  and the writers ask, in anybody who gets anywhere near that subject, you automatically become a  philosopher. You start to ask metaphysical questions. It's not an academic exercise. You have to.  You have to ask this question. It comes up. How could this have happened? But then once you realize  it has, you have to ask yourself the question, what does this say about the human race  that we could do this? How could human beings do this? What does it tell us about the human race  that we could do this? And there's only two answers to that question. That question hits you  right between the eyes every time you read that. The question is all through the article. It's not  thereby the writers. It's there because of the witnesses. They kept saying to themselves,  what does this tell us about the human race? We had no idea that anybody was capable of this.  Now we see they are. What does this tell us? And there's only two answers to that question.  The first answer, which is the normal answer but which is an absolutely wrong and deadly and  dangerous answer, is to say, I'm not capable of that. Most people are not capable of that. Some of them  were. Now who's the them? As soon as you decide that there's a group of people who are capable of it,  you know what's going on? That's the way most of us have dealt with it. Both historically,  both intellectually and even personally, we say, well, most people aren't capable of that just a  certain number of people. But who? As soon as you say, well, those countries were capable of that,  you're in a terrible form of racism, are you not? But even if you say a certain number of people,  you immediately begin to treat them as subhuman people that could do that. They're not like me. People  that could do that. And to defend your own view of yourself, you have to demote a certain number  of people down into a subhuman status. And that is exactly what caused the problem to start with.  As soon as you say, this group of people, they're not like us. They're not human. They're not the same  level. As soon as you do that, you know what goes on? One of the most intriguing things about that  article was the GI's now, 50 years later, are admitting that when they got to the death camps  and they saw what had happened, they immediately said, anybody who did this is subhuman.  And when they saw the guards surrendering, in many cases, they just killed them. They just  bludgeoned them to death. They just wiped them out. Wrong illegal? They did it. Why? Because you see,  the first answer to the question, how could anybody do this is to say, there's a certain number of  subhuman people that can do it, not me. And then you immediately start to treat them as animals.  But that's what caused the issue to start with. That's what started it all.  Then the only other alternative is what? If you don't do that, which is essentially to keep the  process going, right? As soon as you can say, these people are subhuman, then you can treat them in  that way. No trial just wiped them out. And of course, if you do that, then somebody's going to do  that to somebody else is going to do that to somebody else on the coast. The only other alternative is to  say, we're all capable. We're all capable. There's something about the human heart. And that's what  we've been looking at all during length, all during these last two months. There's something about  the human heart. There's seeds in the human heart that should they come forth. The seeds of that  are in us. Those are the only two answers. And the second one has to be the right one. And the  second one is the one, the Bible says. The Bible says, as we've been several times, we've referred  to this. Dorothy Sayer says to Christian writer, she says, sin is a deep interior dislocation of the soul.  You know, when a bone is dislocated, it's not on its proper center. And as a result, there's great pain  and damage. But she says, and the Bible says, the human heart is deeply dislocated spiritually.  It's not centered on God. And because it's not centered on God, all kinds of things can grow. There's  all kinds of pain and damage. There's pride. There's selfishness. There's denial. There's anger.  There's envy. We've been looking at it for two months. And those seeds under the right circumstances  are so deep and so evil that the human heart is capable of this under the right circumstances.  But the way in which people have tried to deal with this and not answered either. I mean, a lot  of people realize, unless you say we're all that evil, you have to say some people are subhuman. And  there's a lot of people that don't want either. And you know what they've been doing? Right in the 50s  and the 60s, what's so intriguing is many of the people who had suffered started writing books  like after Auschwitz. And they began to say, God is to blame. People see, in other words, people don't  want to say, well, this race is subhuman. So what they say is God's to blame. Why didn't he do  something? God's to blame. Why didn't he stop it? And so many of the people who suffered who  were amongst the folks who suffered started writing books like after Auschwitz. But what's interesting  is the Germans themselves, the people who participated in this, they had a deal with things.  And in the 50s and 60s, a play came up out of Germany by Gunter Rutenborn called the Sign of Jonah.  And in that play, a lot of Germans who were part of the problem, part of all this violence  are brought out and they're accused. Why did you do it? And you know what they always say? They say,  I was just taking orders. It's the next level up. That's the ones to blame. So then they bring  the next level up. And what's the next level say? This is a play now. What's the next level say?  They say, well, I was just taking orders too. It's the next level up. So then they bring in the next  level. And what do they say? I was just taking orders and suddenly it starts to hit them. That's  right. It's the one at the top. We're not to blame. It's God to blame. God is the one who is  why didn't God stop it? Why didn't God do something? How can you believe in a God who would allow  such evil and suffering in the world? And what's so interesting is both sides of the whole  cost have produced literature that said God's really to blame. God's the one. The evil of this  world is so terrible. Who's going to be blamed? God. Why didn't God do something? Why doesn't God  do something about the evil and suffering in the world? The passage I just read you. This is the  last time we're looking at this subject of sin. We've been looking at it for two months. Why doesn't  God do something about evil? Why doesn't God do something about the wickedness, the violence that's  here? Why doesn't God do something about the brokenness of the world? This passage tells us  God has. And it tells us about a trial that happened years ago. And it was the most remarkable  trial in the history of the world. I'm looking at it carefully. There's a trial. There's a first  there's a lawsuit. Then there's a trial. And then there's an execution. Now look with me.  First of all, it says the whole Israelite community set out from the desert of Sheen  traveling from place to place as the Lord commanded. They camped at Refidim, but there was no  water for the people to drink. So they quarreled with Moses and said, give us water to drink.  Moses said, why do you quarre with me? Why do you put the Lord to the test?  Then Moses cried out to the Lord. What am I to do with these people? They're ready to stone me.  Now here's what's going on. You see this word quarrel? The Jews were following Moses through  the desert, and they'd come to a place where there was no water. Now this is kind of a metaphor  for life, isn't it? They were trying to be good. They were following God. They'd sworn allegiance.  They'd come to a place where it looked like they were going to die. Some of them had probably  already had died. They didn't see any way out. And this is a metaphor for life. You try to be good.  You try to be moral. You try to be religious. You try to be decent.  And you come to a dead end. You get annihilated. At least your hopes and dreams get annihilated.  And maybe you were very lies get annihilated. And so the question will come up.  How could God do this? Well, trouble is God's not around to put your hands on. So you look to his  representative. See? They start quarreling. Now the word quarrel is a two-week translation.  The Hebrew word that's translated quarrel here in English is a word that means a charge or a  lawsuit. And they're charging Moses with treason because they want to stone him.  They're saying, you've betrayed us. Treason. You've brought us here. We're all going to die.  We're all going to be jackal food. Well, we're going to start with you. We'll make you the appetizer.  In other words, they said, you've killed us through your criminal incompetence and your stupidity.  Moses, however, knows that what they're doing is not just after him, they're after God. See?  Moses said, why do you quarrel with me? You're putting the Lord to the test. And that's the way it goes.  Because you see, many of you may be in this situation too.  You may be very angry at a Moses in your life, but actually you're just mad at how your life is  gone. And behind all of your quarreling with Moses, you've got a quarrel with God.  I don't like the way my life has gone. Why has God let my life go this way? Why has things gone so  poorly in my life? How could God allow this? And so there's a lawsuit against God in our hearts.  So there's a charge going on. There's a charge. Now, what's God's response to it? The response is  a trial. You say, where's a trial? Well, look, the Lord answered Moses, walk on ahead of the people,  take with you some of the elders of Israel and take in your hand the staff with which you  struck the Nile and go. Now, if you look carefully, and I'm going to make you do it, you'll see  something very interesting. He says, take with you some of the elders and take in your hand the  staff with which you struck the Nile. Now, the staff of Moses was not just a walking stick.  The staff was the rod of God. It's the rod through which God punished Egypt. When Moses struck  the Nile with it, it turned to blood. And Moses continually used the rod as God's way of putting  plagues on Egypt. Now, what was this all about? A rod was the sign of civil authority.  In the ancient world, the rod was that which you punished the offender. You beat the offender.  That was the way it was done. And the one who had the rod would have meant was the governor or the  king, the ruler, the one with the civil authority. And in Roman times, by the way, and this is so  intriguing, considering how we're setting this up here today. In Roman times, Roman governors would  carry a bundles of rods, rods bunched together to show their absolute authority and their power.  And you know what those bundles were called in Latin fashies from which we get our word fascist.  This rod was not just Moses' staff. This was the rod of God's authority.  This was the rod of judgment. This was the rod through which God made execution.  Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache. We feel it in the world  around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way? And what can be done about it?  In his brand new book that's releasing this month, what is wrong with the world?  Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer. Drawing from a series of teachings given  at Redeemer, Dr. Keller shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us  and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state  of our world, struggling with your own mistakes or choices, or looking for hope and joy,  what is wrong with the world will help you see how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of  our world and the pain within each of us. This newly released book, What Is Wrong with the World  is our thanks for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the good news of Jesus.

There's going to be a trial also because the elders go too.  And if you know much about the Old Testament, you know that what God would constantly do when someone  was an offender, they would have to appear before the elders and before the rod. That's how they  were tried. And if they were found guilty, there was punishment. So there's going to be a trial,  but who? Well, here's the weird thing. It's not Moses, even though Moses' life is at stake,  Moses is the one who's being charged. Moses is the one whose life is at stake, but Moses has the  rod. So he's not the one who will be standing in the dock. He will not be in the defendant's spot.  So it's not Moses. Well, who will it be? Could it be the children of Israel? Well, you see,  somebody says, well, why? They hadn't done anything wrong. Oh, yes, they had. Oh my, they had.  The children of Israel owed everything to God and Moses.  God came in. Moses came in through God's mighty ax and through Moses' bravery. They have been  let out of Egypt through mighty acts of God. They owed everything to God. And now here they are  saying, I don't like the way God is running our lives. We want the rule back. We want to overthrow  God. We don't like the way he's doing things. They should be saying, why has God been so good to us,  but instead they're saying, what have you done for me lately? And they're saying, we don't like the  way you're running our lives. And so they actually are guilty of the treason that they charge Moses with.  They ought to be in the dock. They ought to be on trial. But that's not who's on trial. Who's on trial? Look  in verse 6, I says, God will stand before you by the rock at Horib. Now listen dear friends,  every place in the Bible, especially in ancient times, who stands before who is very important.  The one who stands before is always the one in the place of servanthood. The servant stands  before the master. The weak stands before the powerful. The condemned stands before the judge.  Nowhere else in all of the Bible do you have God standing before anybody? People stand before him.  No, he never stands before anybody. Who could he possibly stand before?  That's why he says, walk before me. That's why it's in the Old Testament when someone was  brought forth to judgment. They were told to stand before the Lord and the elders of Israel.  But in an absolute, astonishing statement, God says, I will stand before you.  You have the rod. What is God doing? And then he says, I'll stand before you by the rock. Now,  the Hebrew preposition says at the rock or over the rock. And the translators that we use,  the new and national version, that's the English translation we use here, is almost afraid to say what  it actually says. God says, I will stand before you at the rock, over the rock, on the rock. They say  by the rock same thing. I will stand before you at the rock, bring the rod of God up and strike the  rock. The execution. God gets into the dock. God gets into the place of weakness. God gets into  the place of condemnation. Listen, Moses was not really able with a physical stick to hurt God.  But can you imagine how astonished he must have been? You know why? Every time God's presence is  ever, ever manifest. You show the utmost respect. Remember when Moses got near God at the burning  bush, what does God say? Take off your shoes. You're on holy ground. Whenever the presence of God is  around, you treat it with the utmost respect. But here's God saying, I will stand before you  upon the rock at the rock. Hit it. Hit the rock. Bring down the rod of God upon me.  Moses must have been more astonished than he ever was before or after in his entire life and he  would say, how could this be? But we know how it could be. Because in 1 Corinthians 10, Paul says,  our forefathers pass through the red sea and they ate of the same spiritual food and they drank  of the same spiritual drink for they drank from the rock and the rock was Christ.  Here is what's going on. Moses was condemned. He's on trial for his life. God gets into Moses  place. The people should be condemned. They are guilty of treason. God stands in their place.  God on the rock. God in the dock. The dock. He's the defendant. He comes in. God on the rock.  God on the dock. And he's executed. Now you see friends, it didn't happen that day. No, it didn't.  It was a foreshadowing. But a day came in which someone on the cross, which was the rock,  looks up to heaven and says, my God, my God, the same rod that spilled the Nile's blood is now  spilling my blood. The same rod that turned the Nile all the blood is turning me all the blood.  Why? Because we put God in the dock, we should go into the dock but God actually gets  into the dock and takes our punishment for us. One of the most astonishing things about the play,  sign of Jonah. At the end, remember how I said the way they deal with it is they say it's God's  problem. God's the blame. God's the one. Now that's just stupid. Don't you see? We don't want to  look in our own lives. We don't want to look in our own heart. We don't want to say the evil of  this world and the suffering of the death camps. It's our fault. We don't want to do that.  So what we do is we try to put God in the dock. We should be put in the dock for putting God in the  dock, but God goes in himself and takes the blow that we deserve. What's so fascinating is in the  in the sign of Jonah, in the play, at the end, they say you're right. God's the blame. It's not us  and they say let us sentence him to death. And you know what they say? This is what they say.  Say let him become a human being. Let him become a homeless person. Let him become a wanderer on  the earth. Let him lose his son. Let him die. And when he dies, let him be ridiculed and disgraced.  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. He did. He has. Oh Lord, God, why don't you do something about the  suffering of this world? God has done what no other religion even claims a God to have done.  There's not another religion anywhere that even claims that their God has done this. The Bible says  our God has done something about suffering and evil. He came to the bottom of it. He dove in. He plunged  in. You know that incredible Christian poem that says other gods did ride, but thou old Jesus  Christ did stumble through to a throne. To our wounds, only thy wounds can speak. The only God.  The only God who did something about suffering and evil came to get in and took the punishment.  We deserve for the evil of the world. He did it. He did the very thing that we in our self-pity and  arrogance demanded of God. God actually comes as I can save you by doing the very thing that you  call me to do, but your calling is a wicked thing. It deserves judgment, but I'll take the judgment  myself. If you read the eyewitness accounts of those GIs, the one thing that the reason that they  shot, they just started shooting and clubbing the guards. You know why? Because they knew in their  heart of hearts that the only way to deal with this incredible evil was judgment. They had a need  to see judgment. This was a wound that could only be dealt with through judgment. The evil of the  world, the sinfulness of the world, can only be done through judgment. But by subhumanizing, by  dehumanizing the guards, they were keeping from themselves the fact that we all deserve to be judged.  God has dealt with the suffering and evil of this world through judgment. He came and took the  judgment himself. And you see what that means? If you were humble yourself and say, Lord, I deserve  to be struck, but you were struck for me. Then on the last day, God can deal, he can wipe out evil without  wiping out you. God could always have brought down the rod on evil, but then he wipes this all out.  If you believe in him, he can wipe out evil and he will on the last day without wiping out you.  Do you hear him? Now, here's the last thing to say. The water comes from the stricken rock.  The water comes from the stricken rock. And you know what that means? If you look at Jesus Christ,  struck for you. God on the rock, God in the dock, if you see him struck for you, if you see him being  turned all the blood by the rod of God, water comes. It enables you to deal with your wilderness,  it enables you to deal with your desert. You notice God does not take the Israelites out of the  desert. He gives them a provision in the desert. And until he comes back, we are not taken out of  the suffering of this world, but we're given a provision in it. What is it? The sight of the rock  that struck. Friends, if you see the rock struck, that that will enable you to face the wilderness  of life. You say, how? Well, like this, when you see the rock struck, now you know that he's righteous.  He is so righteous. He is such a judge that he has to come and get struck himself if he's  going to forgive us. You know what that means? You don't have to look at the evil of world and  and be galled. You don't have to be a vigilante. You don't have to be bitter because you're going to  say everything will be paid for. A person either asks for mercy through God and God pays for it,  or in pride refuses to ask for mercy and they'll pay for it, but everything will be paid for.  You don't have to be bitter. You don't have to ever have revenge. You don't have to look at the  New York Times in the morning and say, look at all the injustice and get depressed.  Water from the rock. When you see God's stricken, you will know you have a piece that God is going  to put everything right. But that's not all. The other great thing, water from the rock. When you  see God's stricken, that means that we are no longer passive or fatalistic toward the problems  of this world. You know why? Christians are the one group of people in the world that have a God  who was so angry at the brokenness of life he entered into it. So angry at suffering that he entered  into it. Christians have a fighting religion. We say God doesn't like hunger. God doesn't like  evil. God doesn't like injustice. I'm going to fight against it and I'm in the spirit of my father.  I'm in the spirit of my brother Jesus Christ. Don't you see? It was so weird is you can either decide  all well. Let's be passive. You get peace without energy. Or you can say it's awful out there.  You get energy without peace. But if you see the stricken rock, if you see God judged,  if you see Jesus stricken on the one hand, you get a calmness because it's all going to be taken  care of. God's going to judge it all. But you also get a feistyness and energy. You say, look at that.  Jesus Christ suffered. He entered into suffering to do something about it. So will I.  You know what? If you even refuse to sit down and listen to somebody's troubles because you know,  oh my gosh, I don't want to get involved. Oh my. Next thing you know, they'll be calling me. Next  I don't want to get involved in a busy person. You haven't seen Jesus on the rock.  He entered into suffering. Of course it cost him something. It'll cost you something if you follow him.  It won't be cost you anything like what it cost him. But you see water from the rock. If you see  Jesus stricken for you, there'll be peace when you look at injustice, but there'll be a feistyness  and energy when you look at suffering. And not only that, you'll know that he loves you so much  that he would do this for you. There'll be a joy in your heart. You'll say, you know what?  No matter what I've done, he won't bring the rod down on me. He brought the rod down on himself.  He must love me. Incredibly to do this for me. Water from the rock. You can face anything if you  draw from it. You can face any wilderness. Do you see it? And if there's anybody here who says,  you know, I'd be a Christian, but God's got to explain what's wrong in the world. I'd be a Christian.  Somebody once said to me, if he could tell me why he gave me the Father, he gave me. I could be a  Christian. If he could explain to me why he allowed the terrible things to happen in that country  back in that year, I could be a Christian. If God would explain these things, you've got God in  the dock. Don't you see? God gives you something far greater than explanations. He gives you his son.  He gives you his own back. He gives you his own blood. Say to him, oh Lord, you were struck for me.  So I will build myself on your rock. I'll base my life on you because of what you did for me.  Let's pray. Father, we ask that you'll help us to see. You'll help us to see.  Jesus struck for us. God on the rock, God in the dock. The rod come down. Turning our son,  your son, Jesus Christ, our brother, all to blood and help us to draw on that and to receive the  kind of water that comes from that. So we'll have a peace and an energy and a joy that will enable  us to live joyfully in this wilderness until the day in which you bring us into your promised land,  the land of milk and honey. We look to that day. We thank you that the rock that follows us is  Christ. Help us to drink from it in Jesus' name. We ask it, amen.  Thanks for joining us here on the Gospel Unliked Podcast.
