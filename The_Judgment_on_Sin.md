### Introduction: The Problem of Sin

You don't have to look far to see that something's deeply wrong with our world and with us. But is there an answer that gets to the root of why? In today's message, Tim Keller explores the human condition through stories in the Bible, uncovering what Scripture says about sin and why it's the only explanation deep enough to face the truth about ourselves.

The teaching is based today as an print in your bulletinets, Exodus 17, verses 1 to 7. An incident during the time that children of Israel are wandering in the wilderness and we read, the whole Israelite community set out from the desert of sin traveling from place to place as the Lord commanded. They camped at refidem but there was no water for the people to drink. So they quarreled with Moses and said, give us water to drink. Moses replied, why do you quarrele with me? Why do you put the Lord to the test? But the people were thirsty for water there. And they grumbled against Moses. They said, why did you bring us up out of Egypt to make us and our children and livestock die of thirst? Then Moses cried out to the Lord, what am I to do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me. The Lord answered Moses, walk on ahead of the people, take with you some of the elders of Israel and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile and go, I will stand there before you by the rock at horub, strike the rock and the water will come out of it for the people to drink. So Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel and he called the place Masa and Meraba because the Israelites quarreled and because they tested the Lord saying, is the Lord among us or not? This is God's word.

### The Incident at Rephidim

You know, April and May this year marked the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the death camps in Germany just before the end of World War II and the US News and World Report last week or this week, had a large cover story consisting largely of the reports of eyewitnesses, the GIs, American GIs who still are alive, the reports of those eyewitnesses when they liberated those camps. And I thought I knew a lot about the subject but reading that was just devastating. Here are these guys, GIs, that they were battle-hardened. They fought the way across Europe and yet when they saw what they saw, they vomited. And they took pictures saying nobody will believe this. That's one of the reasons why we've got the evidence we've got.

> "How could this have happened? But then once you realize it has, you have to ask yourself the question, what does this say about the human race that we could do this?"

**There's only two answers to that question.**

### The Human Condition and Sin

The first answer, which is the normal answer but which is an absolutely wrong and deadly and dangerous answer, is to say, I'm not capable of that. Most people are not capable of that. Some of them were. Now who's the them? As soon as you decide that there's a group of people who are capable of it, you know what's going on? That's the way most of us have dealt with it. Both historically, both intellectually and even personally, we say, well, most people aren't capable of that just a certain number of people. But who? As soon as you say, well, those countries were capable of that, you're in a terrible form of racism, are you not? But even if you say a certain number of people, you immediately begin to treat them as subhuman people that could do that. They're not like me. People that could do that. And to defend your own view of yourself, you have to demote a certain number of people down into a subhuman status. And that is exactly what caused the problem to start with.

> "As soon as you say, this group of people, they're not like us. They're not human. They're not the same level. As soon as you do that, you know what goes on?"

**The only other alternative is to say, we're all capable.**

### The Trial and Execution

The passage I just read you. This is the last time we're looking at this subject of sin. We've been looking at it for two months. Why doesn't God do something about evil? Why doesn't God do something about the wickedness, the violence that's here? Why doesn't God do something about the brokenness of the world? This passage tells us God has. And it tells us about a trial that happened years ago. And it was the most remarkable trial in the history of the world. I'm looking at it carefully. There's a trial. There's a first there's a lawsuit. Then there's a trial. And then there's an execution.

### God's Response to Evil

Now look with me. First of all, it says the whole Israelite community set out from the desert of Sheen traveling from place to place as the Lord commanded. They camped at Refidim, but there was no water for the people to drink. So they quarreled with Moses and said, give us water to drink. Moses said, why do you quarre with me? Why do you put the Lord to the test? Then Moses cried out to the Lord. What am I to do with these people? They're ready to stone me. Now here's what's going on. You see this word quarrel? The Jews were following Moses through the desert, and they'd come to a place where there was no water. Now this is kind of a metaphor for life, isn't it? They were trying to be good. They were following God. They'd sworn allegiance. They'd come to a place where it looked like they were going to die. Some of them had probably already had died. They didn't see any way out. And this is a metaphor for life. You try to be good. You try to be moral. You try to be religious. You try to be decent. And you come to a dead end. You get annihilated. At least your hopes and dreams get annihilated. And maybe you were very lies get annihilated. And so the question will come up. How could God do this? Well, trouble is God's not around to put your hands on. So you look to his representative. See? They start quarreling. Now the word quarrel is a two-week translation. The Hebrew word that's translated quarrel here in English is a word that means a charge or a lawsuit. And they're charging Moses with treason because they want to stone him. They're saying, you've betrayed us. Treason. You've brought us here. We're all going to die. We're all going to be jackal food. Well, we're going to start with you. We'll make you the appetizer. In other words, they said, you've killed us through your criminal incompetence and your stupidity. Moses, however, knows that what they're doing is not just after him, they're after God. See? Moses said, why do you quarrel with me? You're putting the Lord to the test. And that's the way it goes. Because you see, many of you may be in this situation too. You may be very angry at a Moses in your life, but actually you're just mad at how your life is gone. And behind all of your quarreling with Moses, you've got a quarrel with God. I don't like the way my life has gone. Why has God let my life go this way? Why has things gone so poorly in my life? How could God allow this? And so there's a lawsuit against God in our hearts. So there's a charge going on. There's a charge. Now, what's God's response to it? The response is a trial. You say, where's a trial? Well, look, the Lord answered Moses, walk on ahead of the people, take with you some of the elders of Israel and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile and go. Now, if you look carefully, and I'm going to make you do it, you'll see something very interesting. He says, take with you some of the elders and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile. Now, the staff of Moses was not just a walking stick. The staff was the rod of God. It's the rod through which God punished Egypt. When Moses struck the Nile with it, it turned to blood. And Moses continually used the rod as God's way of putting plagues on Egypt. Now, what was this all about? A rod was the sign of civil authority. In the ancient world, the rod was that which you punished the offender. You beat the offender. That was the way it was done. And the one who had the rod would have meant was the governor or the king, the ruler, the one with the civil authority. And in Roman times, by the way, and this is so intriguing, considering how we're setting this up here today. In Roman times, Roman governors would carry a bundles of rods, rods bunched together to show their absolute authority and their power. And you know what those bundles were called in Latin fashies from which we get our word fascist. This rod was not just Moses' staff. This was the rod of God's authority. This was the rod of judgment. This was the rod through which God made execution. Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache. We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way? And what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing this month, what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer. Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer, Dr. Keller shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes or choices, or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world will help you see how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us. This newly released book, What Is Wrong with the World is our thanks for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the good news of Jesus.

### The Stricken Rock

There's going to be an execution. There's going to be a trial also because the elders go too. And if you know much about the Old Testament, you know that what God would constantly do when someone was an offender, they would have to appear before the elders and before the rod. That's how they were tried. And if they were found guilty, there was punishment. So there's going to be a trial, but who? Well, here's the weird thing. It's not Moses, even though Moses' life is at stake, Moses is the one who's being charged. Moses is the one whose life is at stake, but Moses has the rod. So he's not the one who will be standing in the dock. He will not be in the defendant's spot. So it's not Moses. Well, who will it be? Could it be the children of Israel? Well, you see, somebody says, well, why? They hadn't done anything wrong. Oh, yes, they had. Oh my, they had. The children of Israel owed everything to God and Moses. God came in. Moses came in through God's mighty ax and through Moses' bravery. They have been let out of Egypt through mighty acts of God. They owed everything to God. And now here they are saying, I don't like the way God is running our lives. We want the rule back. We want to overthrow God. We don't like the way he's doing things. They should be saying, why has God been so good to us, but instead they're saying, what have you done for me lately? And they're saying, we don't like the way you're running our lives. And so they actually are guilty of the treason that they charge Moses with. They ought to be in the dock. They ought to be on trial. But that's not who's on trial. Who's on trial? Look in verse 6, I says, God will stand before you by the rock at Horib. Now listen dear friends, every place in the Bible, especially in ancient times, who stands before who is very important. The one who stands before is always the one in the place of servanthood. The servant stands before the master. The weak stands before the powerful. The condemned stands before the judge. Nowhere else in all of the Bible do you have God standing before anybody? People stand before him. No, he never stands before anybody. Who could he possibly stand before? That's why he says, walk before me. That's why it's in the Old Testament when someone was brought forth to judgment. They were told to stand before the Lord and the elders of Israel. But in an absolute, astonishing statement, God says, I will stand before you. You have the rod. What is God doing? And then he says, I'll stand before you by the rock. Now, the Hebrew preposition says at the rock or over the rock. And the translators that we use, the new and national version, that's the English translation we use here, is almost afraid to say what it actually says. God says, I will stand before you at the rock, over the rock, on the rock. They say by the rock same thing. I will stand before you at the rock, bring the rod of God up and strike the rock. The execution. God gets into the dock. God gets into the place of weakness. God gets into the place of condemnation. Listen, Moses was not really able with a physical stick to hurt God. But can you imagine how astonished he must have been? You know why? Every time God's presence is ever, ever manifest. You show the utmost respect. Remember when Moses got near God at the burning bush, what does God say? Take off your shoes. You're on holy ground. Whenever the presence of God is around, you treat it with the utmost respect. But here's God saying, I will stand before you upon the rock at the rock. Hit it. Hit the rock. Bring down the rod of God upon me. Moses must have been more astonished than he ever was before or after in his entire life and he would say, how could this be? But we know how it could be. Because in 1 Corinthians 10, Paul says, our forefathers pass through the red sea and they ate of the same spiritual food and they drank of the same spiritual drink for they drank from the rock and the rock was Christ. Here is what's going on. Moses was condemned. He's on trial for his life. God gets into Moses place. The people should be condemned. They are guilty of treason. God stands in their place. God on the rock. God in the dock. The dock. He's the defendant. He comes in. God on the rock. God on the dock. And he's executed. Now you see friends, it didn't happen that day. No, it didn't. It was a foreshadowing. But a day came in which someone on the cross, which was the rock, looks up to heaven and says, my God, my God, the same rod that spilled the Nile's blood is now spilling my blood. The same rod that turned the Nile all the blood is turning me all the blood. Why? Because we put God in the dock, we should go into the dock but God actually gets into the dock and takes our punishment for us. One of the most astonishing things about the play, sign of Jonah. At the end, remember how I said the way they deal with it is they say it's God's problem. God's the blame. God's the one. Now that's just stupid. Don't you see? We don't want to look in our own lives. We don't want to look in our own heart. We don't want to say the evil of this world and the suffering of the death camps. It's our fault. We don't want to do that. So what we do is we try to put God in the dock. We should be put in the dock for putting God in the dock, but God goes in himself and takes the blow that we deserve. What's so fascinating is in the in the sign of Jonah, in the play, at the end, they say you're right. God's the blame. It's not us and they say let us sentence him to death. And you know what they say? This is what they say. Say let him become a human being. Let him become a homeless person. Let him become a wanderer on the earth. Let him lose his son. Let him die. And when he dies, let him be ridiculed and disgraced. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. He did. He has. Oh Lord, God, why don't you do something about the suffering of this world? God has done what no other religion even claims a God to have done. There's not another religion anywhere that even claims that their God has done this. The Bible says our God has done something about suffering and evil. He came to the bottom of it. He dove in. He plunged in. You know that incredible Christian poem that says other gods did ride, but thou old Jesus Christ did stumble through to a throne. To our wounds, only thy wounds can speak. The only God. The only God who did something about suffering and evil came to get in and took the punishment. We deserve for the evil of the world. He did it. He did the very thing that we in our self-pity and arrogance demanded of God. God actually comes as I can save you by doing the very thing that you call me to do, but your calling is a wicked thing. It deserves judgment, but I'll take the judgment myself. If you read the eyewitness accounts of those GIs, the one thing that the reason that they shot, they just started shooting and clubbing the guards. You know why? Because they knew in their heart of hearts that the only way to deal with this incredible evil was judgment. They had a need to see judgment. This was a wound that could only be dealt with through judgment. The evil of the world, the sinfulness of the world, can only be done through judgment. But by subhumanizing, by dehumanizing the guards, they were keeping from themselves the fact that we all deserve to be judged. God has dealt with the suffering and evil of this world through judgment. He came and took the judgment himself. And you see what that means? If you were humble yourself and say, Lord, I deserve to be struck, but you were struck for me. Then on the last day, God can deal, he can wipe out evil without wiping out you. God could always have brought down the rod on evil, but then he wipes this all out. If you believe in him, he can wipe out evil and he will on the last day without wiping out you. Do you hear him? Now, here's the last thing to say. The water comes from the stricken rock. The water comes from the stricken rock. And you know what that means? If you look at Jesus Christ, struck for you. God on the rock, God in the dock, if you see him struck for you, if you see him being turned all the blood by the rod of God, water comes. It enables you to deal with your wilderness, it enables you to deal with your desert. You notice God does not take the Israelites out of the desert. He gives them a provision in the desert. And until he comes back, we are not taken out of the suffering of this world, but we're given a provision in it. What is it? The sight of the rock that struck. Friends, if you see the rock struck, that that will enable you to face the wilderness of life. You say, how? Well, like this, when you see the rock struck, now you know that he's righteous. He is so righteous. He is such a judge that he has to come and get struck himself if he's going to forgive us. You know what that means? You don't have to look at the evil of world and and be galled. You don't have to be a vigilante. You don't have to be bitter because you're going to say everything will be paid for. A person either asks for mercy through God and God pays for it, or in pride refuses to ask for mercy and they'll pay for it, but everything will be paid for. You don't have to be bitter. You don't have to ever have revenge. You don't have to look at the New York Times in the morning and say, look at all the injustice and get depressed. Water from the rock. When you see God's stricken, you will know you have a piece that God is going to put everything right. But that's not all. The other great thing, water from the rock. When you see God's stricken, that means that we are no longer passive or fatalistic toward the problems of this world. You know why? Christians are the one group of people in the world that have a God who was so angry at the brokenness of life he entered into it. So angry at suffering that he entered into it. Christians have a fighting religion. We say God doesn't like hunger. God doesn't like evil. God doesn't like injustice. I'm going to fight against it and I'm in the spirit of my father. I'm in the spirit of my brother Jesus Christ. Don't you see? It was so weird is you can either decide all well. Let's be passive. You get peace without energy. Or you can say it's awful out there. You get energy without peace. But if you see the stricken rock, if you see God judged, if you see Jesus stricken on the one hand, you get a calmness because it's all going to be taken care of. God's going to judge it all. But you also get a feistyness and energy. You say, look at that. Jesus Christ suffered. He entered into suffering to do something about it. So will I. You know what? If you even refuse to sit down and listen to somebody's troubles because you know, oh my gosh, I don't want to get involved. Oh my. Next thing you know, they'll be calling me. Next I don't want to get involved in a busy person. You haven't seen Jesus on the rock. He entered into suffering. Of course it cost him something. It'll cost you something if you follow him. It won't be cost you anything like what it cost him. But you see water from the rock. If you see Jesus stricken for you, there'll be peace when you look at injustice, but there'll be a feistyness and energy when you look at suffering. And not only that, you'll know that he loves you so much that he would do this for you. There'll be a joy in your heart. You'll say, you know what? No matter what I've done, he won't bring the rod down on me. He brought the rod down on himself. He must love me. Incredibly to do this for me. Water from the rock. You can face anything if you draw from it. You can face any wilderness. Do you see it? And if there's anybody here who says, you know, I'd be a Christian, but God's got to explain what's wrong in the world. I'd be a Christian. Somebody once said to me, if he could tell me why he gave me the Father, he gave me. I could be a Christian. If he could explain to me why he allowed the terrible things to happen in that country back in that year, I could be a Christian. If God would explain these things, you've got God in the dock. Don't you see? God gives you something far greater than explanations. He gives you his son. He gives you his own back. He gives you his own blood. Say to him, oh Lord, you were struck for me. So I will build myself on your rock. I'll base my life on you because of what you did for me. Let's pray. Father, we ask that you'll help us to see. You'll help us to see. Jesus struck for us. God on the rock, God in the dock. The rod come down. Turning our son, your son, Jesus Christ, our brother, all to blood and help us to draw on that and to receive the kind of water that comes from that. So we'll have a peace and an energy and a joy that will enable us to live joyfully in this wilderness until the day in which you bring us into your promised land, the land of milk and honey. We look to that day. We thank you that the rock that follows us is Christ. Help us to drink from it in Jesus' name. We ask it, amen.

### Introduction: The Problem of Sin

You don't have to look far to see that something's deeply wrong with our world and with us. But is there an answer that gets to the root of why? In today's message, Tim Keller explores the human condition through stories in the Bible, uncovering what Scripture says about sin and why it's the only explanation deep enough to face the truth about ourselves.

The teaching is based today as an print in your bulletinets, Exodus 17, verses 1 to 7. An incident during the time that children of Israel are wandering in the wilderness and we read, the whole Israelite community set out from the desert of sin traveling from place to place as the Lord commanded. They camped at refidem but there was no water for the people to drink. So they quarreled with Moses and said, give us water to drink. Moses replied, why do you quarrele with me? Why do you put the Lord to the test? But the people were thirsty for water there. And they grumbled against Moses. They said, why did you bring us up out of Egypt to make us and our children and livestock die of thirst? Then Moses cried out to the Lord, what am I to do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me. The Lord answered Moses, walk on ahead of the people, take with you some of the elders of Israel and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile and go, I will stand there before you by the rock at horub, strike the rock and the water will come out of it for the people to drink. So Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel and he called the place Masa and Meraba because the Israelites quarreled and because they tested the Lord saying, is the Lord among us or not? This is God's word.

### The Incident at Rephidim

You know, April and May this year marked the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the death camps in Germany just before the end of World War II and the US News and World Report last week or this week, had a large cover story consisting largely of the reports of eyewitnesses, the GIs, American GIs who still are alive, the reports of those eyewitnesses when they liberated those camps. And I thought I knew a lot about the subject but reading that was just devastating. Here are these guys, GIs, that they were battle-hardened. They fought the way across Europe and yet when they saw what they saw, they vomited. And they took pictures saying nobody will believe this. That's one of the reasons why we've got the evidence we've got.

> "How could this have happened? But then once you realize it has, you have to ask yourself the question, what does this say about the human race that we could do this?"

**There's only two answers to that question.**

### The Human Condition and Sin

The first answer, which is the normal answer but which is an absolutely wrong and deadly and dangerous answer, is to say, I'm not capable of that. Most people are not capable of that. Some of them were. Now who's the them? As soon as you decide that there's a group of people who are capable of it, you know what's going on? That's the way most of us have dealt with it. Both historically, both intellectually and even personally, we say, well, most people aren't capable of that just a certain number of people. But who?

But even if you say a certain number of people, you immediately begin to treat them as subhuman people that could do that. They're not like me. People that could do that. And to defend your own view of yourself, you have to demote a certain number of people down into a subhuman status. And that is exactly what caused the problem to start with.

**The only other alternative is to say, we're all capable.**

### The Trial and Execution

The passage I just read you. This is the last time we're looking at this subject of sin. We've been looking at it for two months. Why doesn't God do something about evil? Why doesn't God do something about the wickedness, the violence that's here? Why doesn't God do something about the brokenness of the world? This passage tells us God has. And it tells us about a trial that happened years ago. And it was the most remarkable trial in the history of the world. I'm looking at it carefully. There's a trial. There's a first there's a lawsuit. Then there's a trial. And then there's an execution.

### God's Response to Evil

Now look with me. First of all, it says the whole Israelite community set out from the desert of Sheen traveling from place to place as the Lord commanded. They camped at Refidim, but there was no water for the people to drink. So they quarreled with Moses and said, give us water to drink. Moses said, why do you quarre with me? Why do you put the Lord to the test? Then Moses cried out to the Lord. What am I to do with these people? They're ready to stone me. Now here's what's going on. You see this word quarrel? The Jews were following Moses through the desert, and they'd come to a place where there was no water. Now this is kind of a metaphor for life, isn't it? They were trying to be good. They were following God. They'd sworn allegiance. They'd come to a place where it looked like they were going to die. Some of them had probably already had died. They didn't see any way out. And this is a metaphor for life. You try to be good. You try to be moral. You try to be religious. You try to be decent. And you come to a dead end. You get annihilated. At least your hopes and dreams get annihilated. And maybe you were very lies get annihilated. And so the question will come up. How could God do this? Well, trouble is God's not around to put your hands on. So you look to his representative. See? They start quarreling. Now the word quarrel is a two-week translation. The Hebrew word that's translated quarrel here in English is a word that means a charge or a lawsuit. And they're charging Moses with treason because they want to stone him. They're saying, you've betrayed us. Treason. You've brought us here. We're all going to die. We're all going to be jackal food. Well, we're going to start with you. We'll make you the appetizer. In other words, they said, you've killed us through your criminal incompetence and your stupidity. Moses, however, knows that what they're doing is not just after him, they're after God. See? Moses said, why do you quarrel with me? You're putting the Lord to the test. And that's the way it goes. Because you see, many of you may be in this situation too. You may be very angry at a Moses in your life, but actually you're just mad at how your life is gone. And behind all of your quarreling with Moses, you've got a quarrel with God. I don't like the way my life has gone. Why has God let my life go this way? Why has things gone so poorly in my life? How could God allow this? And so there's a lawsuit against God in our hearts. So there's a charge going on. There's a charge. Now, what's God's response to it? The response is a trial. You say, where's a trial? Well, look, the Lord answered Moses, walk on ahead of the people, take with you some of the elders of Israel and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile and go. Now, if you look carefully, and I'm going to make you do it, you'll see something very interesting. He says, take with you some of the elders and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile. Now, the staff of Moses was not just a walking stick. The staff was the rod of God. It's the rod through which God punished Egypt. When Moses struck the Nile with it, it turned to blood. And Moses continually used the rod as God's way of putting plagues on Egypt.

And the one who had the rod would have meant was the governor or the king, the ruler, the one with the civil authority. And in Roman times, by the way, and this is so intriguing, considering how we're setting this up here today. In Roman times, Roman governors would carry a bundles of rods, rods bunched together to show their absolute authority and their power. And you know what those bundles were called in Latin fashies from which we get our word fascist. This rod was not just Moses' staff. This was the rod of God's authority. This was the rod of judgment. This was the rod through which God made execution. Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache. We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way? And what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing this month, what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer. Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer, Dr. Keller shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes or choices, or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world will help you see how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us.

### The Stricken Rock

There's going to be an execution. There's going to be a trial also because the elders go too. And if you know much about the Old Testament, you know that what God would constantly do when someone was an offender, they would have to appear before the elders and before the rod. That's how they were tried. And if they were found guilty, there was punishment. So there's going to be a trial, but who? Well, here's the weird thing. It's not Moses, even though Moses' life is at stake, Moses is the one who's being charged. Moses is the one whose life is at stake, but Moses has the rod. So he's not the one who will be standing in the dock. He will not be in the defendant's spot. So it's not Moses. Well, who will it be? Could it be the children of Israel? Well, you see, somebody says, well, why? They hadn't done anything wrong. Oh, yes, they had. Oh my, they had. The children of Israel owed everything to God and Moses. God came in. Moses came in through God's mighty ax and through Moses' bravery. They have been let out of Egypt through mighty acts of God. They owed everything to God. And now here they are saying, I don't like the way God is running our lives. We want the rule back. We want to overthrow God. We don't like the way he's doing things. They should be saying, why has God been so good to us, but instead they're saying, what have you done for me lately? And they're saying, we don't like the way you're running our lives. And so they actually are guilty of the treason that they charge Moses with. They ought to be in the dock. They ought to be on trial. But that's not who's on trial. Who's on trial? Look in verse 6, I says, God will stand before you by the rock at Horib. Now listen dear friends, every place in the Bible, especially in ancient times, who stands before who is very important. The one who stands before is always the one in the place of servanthood. The servant stands before the master. The weak stands before the powerful. The condemned stands before the judge. Nowhere else in all of the Bible do you have God standing before anybody? People stand before him. No, he never stands before anybody. Who could he possibly stand before? That's why he says, walk before me. That's why it's in the Old Testament when someone was brought forth to judgment. They were told to stand before the Lord and the elders of Israel. But in an absolute, astonishing statement, God says, I will stand before you. You have the rod. What is God doing? And then he says, I'll stand before you by the rock. Now, the Hebrew preposition says at the rock or over the rock. And the translators that we use, the new and national version, that's the English translation we use here, is almost afraid to say what it actually says. God says, I will stand before you at the rock, over the rock, on the rock. They say by the rock same thing. I will stand before you at the rock, bring the rod of God up and strike the rock. The execution. God gets into the dock. God gets into the place of weakness. God gets into the place of condemnation. Listen, Moses was not really able with a physical stick to hurt God. But can you imagine how astonished he must have been? You know why? Every time God's presence is ever, ever manifest. You show the utmost respect. Remember when Moses got near God at the burning bush, what does God say? Take off your shoes. You're on holy ground. Whenever the presence of God is around, you treat it with the utmost respect. But here's God saying, I will stand before you upon the rock at the rock. Hit it. Hit the rock. Bring down the rod of God upon me. Moses must have been more astonished than he ever was before or after in his entire life and he would say, how could this be? But we know how it could be. Because in 1 Corinthians 10, Paul says, our forefathers pass through the red sea and they ate of the same spiritual food and they drank of the same spiritual drink for they drank from the rock and the rock was Christ. Here is what's going on. Moses was condemned. He's on trial for his life. God gets into Moses place. The people should be condemned. They are guilty of treason. God stands in their place. God on the rock. God in the dock. The dock. He's the defendant. He comes in. God on the rock. God on the dock. And he's executed. Now you see friends, it didn't happen that day. No, it didn't. It was a foreshadowing. But a day came in which someone on the cross, which was the rock, looks up to heaven and says, my God, my God, the same rod that spilled the Nile's blood is now spilling my blood. The same rod that turned the Nile all the blood is turning me all the blood. Why? Because we put God in the dock, we should go into the dock but God actually gets into the dock and takes our punishment for us. One of the most astonishing things about the play, sign of Jonah. At the end, remember how I said the way they deal with it is they say it's God's problem. God's the blame. God's the one. Now that's just stupid. Don't you see? We don't want to look in our own lives. We don't want to look in our own heart. We don't want to say the evil of this world and the suffering of the death camps. It's our fault. We don't want to do that. So what we do is we try to put God in the dock. We should be put in the dock for putting God in the dock, but God goes in himself and takes the blow that we deserve. What's so fascinating is in the in the sign of Jonah, in the play, at the end, they say you're right. God's the blame. It's not us and they say let us sentence him to death. And you know what they say? This is what they say. Say let him become a human being. Let him become a homeless person. Let him become a wanderer on the earth. Let him lose his son. Let him die. And when he dies, let him be ridiculed and disgraced. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. He did. He has. Oh Lord, God, why don't you do something about the suffering of this world? God has done what no other religion even claims a God to have done. There's not another religion anywhere that even claims that their God has done this. The Bible says our God has done something about suffering and evil. He came to the bottom of it. He dove in. He plunged in. You know that incredible Christian poem that says other gods did ride, but thou old Jesus Christ did stumble through to a throne. To our wounds, only thy wounds can speak. The only God. The only God who did something about suffering and evil came to get in and took the punishment. We deserve for the evil of the world. He did it. He did the very thing that we in our self-pity and arrogance demanded of God. God actually comes as I can save you by doing the very thing that you call me to do, but your calling is a wicked thing. It deserves judgment, but I'll take the judgment myself. If you read the eyewitness accounts of those GIs, the one thing that the reason that they shot, they just started shooting and clubbing the guards. You know why? Because they knew in their heart of hearts that the only way to deal with this incredible evil was judgment. They had a need to see judgment. This was a wound that could only be dealt with through judgment. The evil of the world, the sinfulness of the world, can only be done through judgment. But by subhumanizing, by dehumanizing the guards, they were keeping from themselves the fact that we all deserve to be judged. God has dealt with the suffering and evil of this world through judgment. He came and took the judgment himself. And you see what that means? If you were humble yourself and say, Lord, I deserve to be struck, but you were struck for me. Then on the last day, God can deal, he can wipe out evil without wiping out you. God could always have brought down the rod on evil, but then he wipes this all out. If you believe in him, he can wipe out evil and he will on the last day without wiping out you. Do you hear him? Now, here's the last thing to say. The water comes from the stricken rock. The water comes from the stricken rock. And you know what that means? If you look at Jesus Christ, struck for you. God on the rock, God in the dock, if you see him struck for you, if you see him being turned all the blood by the rod of God, water comes. It enables you to deal with your wilderness, it enables you to deal with your desert. You notice God does not take the Israelites out of the desert. He gives them a provision in the desert. And until he comes back, we are not taken out of the suffering of this world, but we're given a provision in it. What is it? The sight of the rock that struck. Friends, if you see the rock struck, that that will enable you to face the wilderness of life. You say, how? Well, like this, when you see the rock struck, now you know that he's righteous. He is so righteous. He is such a judge that he has to come and get struck himself if he's going to forgive us. You know what that means? You don't have to look at the evil of world and and be galled. You don't have to be a vigilante. You don't have to be bitter because you're going to say everything will be paid for. A person either asks for mercy through God and God pays for it, or in pride refuses to ask for mercy and they'll pay for it, but everything will be paid for. You don't have to be bitter. You don't have to ever have revenge. You don't have to look at the New York Times in the morning and say, look at all the injustice and get depressed. Water from the rock. When you see God's stricken, you will know you have a piece that God is going to put everything right. But that's not all. The other great thing, water from the rock. When you see God's stricken, that means that we are no longer passive or fatalistic toward the problems of this world. You know why? Christians are the one group of people in the world that have a God who was so angry at the brokenness of life he entered into it. So angry at suffering that he entered into it. Christians have a fighting religion. We say God doesn't like hunger. God doesn't like evil. God doesn't like injustice. I'm going to fight against it and I'm in the spirit of my father. I'm in the spirit of my brother Jesus Christ. Don't you see? It was so weird is you can either decide all well. Let's be passive. You get peace without energy. Or you can say it's awful out there. You get energy without peace. But if you see the stricken rock, if you see God judged, if you see Jesus stricken on the one hand, you get a calmness because it's all going to be taken care of. God's going to judge it all. But you also get a feistyness and energy. You say, look at that. Jesus Christ suffered. He entered into suffering to do something about it. So will I. You know what? If you even refuse to sit down and listen to somebody's troubles because you know, oh my gosh, I don't want to get involved. Oh my. Next thing you know, they'll be calling me. Next I don't want to get involved in a busy person. You haven't seen Jesus on the rock. He entered into suffering. Of course it cost him something. It'll cost you something if you follow him. It won't be cost you anything like what it cost him. But you see water from the rock. If you see Jesus stricken for you, there'll be peace when you look at injustice, but there'll be a feistyness and energy when you look at suffering. And not only that, you'll know that he loves you so much that he would do this for you. There'll be a joy in your heart. You'll say, you know what? No matter what I've done, he won't bring the rod down on me. He brought the rod down on himself. He must love me. Incredibly to do this for me. Water from the rock. You can face anything if you draw from it. You can face any wilderness. Do you see it? And if there's anybody here who says, you know, I'd be a Christian, but God's got to explain what's wrong in the world. I'd be a Christian. Somebody once said to me, if he could tell me why he gave me the Father, he gave me. I could be a Christian. If he could explain to me why he allowed the terrible things to happen in that country back in that year, I could be a Christian. If God would explain these things, you've got God in the dock. Don't you see? God gives you something far greater than explanations. He gives you his son. He gives you his own back. He gives you his own blood. Say to him, oh Lord, you were struck for me. So I will build myself on your rock. I'll base my life on you because of what you did for me. Let's pray. Father, we ask that you'll help us to see. You'll help us to see. Jesus struck for us. God on the rock, God in the dock. The rod come down. Turning our son, your son, Jesus Christ, our brother, all to blood and help us to draw on that and to receive the kind of water that comes from that. So we'll have a peace and an energy and a joy that will enable us to live joyfully in this wilderness until the day in which you bring us into your promised land, the land of milk and honey. We look to that day. We thank you that the rock that follows us is Christ. Help us to drink from it in Jesus' name. We ask it, amen.

### 引言：罪的问题

你不需要走得太远就能看到我们的世界和我们自身存在着深刻的问题。但是否有一个答案能够深入探讨其根源？在今天的信息中，Tim Keller 通过圣经中的故事探讨了人类的状况，揭示了圣经对罪的看法，以及为什么它是唯一足够深刻的解释，能够面对关于我们自己的真相。

今天的教导基于你们公告中的出埃及记第17章1到7节。以色列的子民在旷野中流浪时发生的一个事件，我们读到：以色列全会众从汛的旷野出发，按着耶和华的吩咐从一个地方到另一个地方。他们在利非订安营，但那里没有水喝。于是他们与摩西争吵，说，给我们水喝。摩西回答说，你们为什么与我争吵？为什么试探耶和华？但百姓在那里渴望水，并向摩西发怨言。他们说，你为什么把我们从埃及带上来，使我们和我们的儿女牲畜都渴死呢？于是摩西向耶和华呼求，说，我该怎样对待这百姓呢？他们几乎要用石头打死我。耶和华回答摩西说，走在百姓前面，带着以色列的长老，手中拿着你击打尼罗河的杖，去吧，我要在何烈的磐石那里站在你面前，你要击打磐石，水就会从磐石流出来给百姓喝。于是摩西在以色列长老的眼前这样做了，并称那地方为玛撒和米利巴，因为以色列人争吵，并因为他们试探耶和华说，耶和华在我们中间吗？这是神的话。

### 在利非订的事件

你知道，今年的四月和五月标志着德国死亡营解放50周年，就在第二次世界大战结束前不久，《美国新闻与世界报道》上周或本周有一个大封面故事，主要由目击者的报告组成，这些仍然活着的美国士兵解放那些营地时的报告。我以为我对这个主题已经了解很多，但阅读这些报告真是令人震惊。这些士兵都是经过战斗洗礼的，他们一路打过欧洲，但当他们看到所看到的东西时，他们呕吐了。他们拍下照片说没人会相信这是真的。这就是为什么我们有了这些证据。

> "这怎么可能发生？但一旦你意识到它确实发生了，你就必须问自己一个问题，这说明了我们人类什么？"

**这个问题只有两个答案。**

### 人类状况与罪

第一个答案是正常的答案，但这是一个绝对错误、致命和危险的答案，就是说，我不可能做到那样。大多数人不可能做到那样。只有一些人能做到。那他们是谁呢？一旦你决定有一群人能做到这一点，你知道发生了什么吗？这就是我们大多数人处理它的方式。无论是历史上，还是智力上，甚至是个人上，我们都说，好吧，大多数人做不到那样，只有一部分人能做到。但谁呢？一旦你说，好吧，那些国家能做到那样，你就陷入了一种可怕的种族主义，不是吗？但即使你说一部分人能做到，你立即开始把他们视为非人类，他们能做到那样。他们不像我。能做到那样的人。为了捍卫你对自己的看法，你必须把一部分人降级为非人类的地位。而这正是问题开始的原因。

> "一旦你说，这群人，他们不像我们。他们不是人类。他们不在同一水平。一旦你这样做，你知道发生了什么吗？"

**唯一的另一个选择是说，我们都能做到。**

### 审判与执行

我刚刚读给你的这段经文。这是我们最后一次探讨罪的问题。我们已经探讨了两个月。为什么神不做点什么来对付邪恶？为什么神不做点什么来对付这里的邪恶、暴力？为什么神不做点什么来对付世界的破碎？这段经文告诉我们，神已经做了。它告诉我们关于多年前发生的一个审判，这是历史上最非凡的审判。我仔细地看着它。有一个审判。首先有一个诉讼。然后有一个审判。然后有一个执行。

### 神对邪恶的回应

现在和我一起看。首先，它说以色列全会众从汛的旷野出发，按着耶和华的吩咐从一个地方到另一个地方。他们在利非订安营，但那里没有水喝。于是他们与摩西争吵，说，给我们水喝。摩西说，你们为什么与我争吵？为什么试探耶和华？然后摩西向耶和华呼求。我该怎样对待这百姓呢？他们几乎要用石头打死我。现在这里发生了什么。你看到这个词争吵了吗？犹太人跟随摩西穿越沙漠，他们来到一个没有水的地方。现在这有点像生活的隐喻，不是吗？他们试图做好事。他们跟随神。他们宣誓效忠。他们来到一个看起来要死的地方。有些人可能已经死了。他们看不到任何出路。这是生活的隐喻。你试图做好事。你试图道德。你试图宗教。你试图体面。然后你来到一个死胡同。你被消灭了。至少你的希望和梦想被消灭了。也许你自己的生命被消灭了。于是问题就会出现。神怎么能这样做？问题是神不在你能抓住的地方。所以你看向他的代表。看，他们开始争吵。现在这个词争吵是一个太弱的翻译。希伯来语中翻译为争吵的词在英语中是一个意思是指控或诉讼的词。他们指控摩西叛国，因为他们想用石头打死他。他们说，你背叛了我们。叛国。你把我们带到这里。我们都要死了。我们都要成为豺狼的食物。好吧，我们要从你开始。我们会让你成为开胃菜。换句话说，他们说，你通过你的犯罪无能和愚蠢杀了我们。然而，摩西知道他们所做的不仅仅是针对他，他们是针对神。看？摩西说，你们为什么与我争吵？你们是在试探耶和华。这就是事情的经过。因为你看，你们中的许多人可能也处于这种情况。你可能对你生活中的摩西非常生气，但实际上你只是对你的生活感到愤怒。在你与摩西的所有争吵背后，你与神有争吵。我不喜欢我的生活方式。为什么神让我的生活这样？为什么我的生活如此糟糕？神怎么能允许这样？所以在我们心中对神有一个诉讼。所以有一个指控正在进行。有一个指控。现在，神对此的回应是什么？回应是一个审判。你说，审判在哪里？好吧，看，耶和华回答摩西，走在百姓前面，带着以色列的长老，手中拿着你击打尼罗河的杖，去吧。现在，如果你仔细看，我会让你这样做，你会看到一些非常有趣的东西。他说，带着一些长老，手中拿着你击打尼罗河的杖。现在，摩西的杖不仅仅是一个行走的棍子。杖是神的杖。是通过它神惩罚埃及的杖。当摩西用它击打尼罗河时，河水变成了血。摩西不断使用杖作为神对埃及施加灾难的方式。现在，这一切是关于什么的？杖是民事权威的象征。在古代，杖是你惩罚罪犯的工具。你打罪犯。这就是它的作用。拥有杖的人意味着是总督或国王，统治者，拥有民事权威的人。在罗马时代，顺便说一下，这非常有趣，考虑到我们今天的设置。在罗马时代，罗马总督会携带一捆捆的杖，捆绑在一起以显示他们的绝对权威和力量。你知道这些捆绑在拉丁语中被称为什么吗？法西斯，从中我们得到了法西斯这个词。这个杖不仅仅是摩西的杖。这是神权威的杖。这是审判的杖。这是神执行的杖。我们到处看到破碎，战争，残酷和心痛。我们在周围的世界和我们自己的生活中感受到它。它是如何变成这样的？可以做些什么呢？在他本月发布的新书中，世界出了什么问题？Tim Keller 提供了一个清晰而富有同情心的答案。基于 Redeemer 的一系列教导，Keller 博士展示了罪的现实如何解释我们周围看到的痛苦，以及只有福音才能提供持久的自由和治愈。无论你是被我们世界的状态压倒，还是在自己的错误或选择中挣扎，还是在寻找希望和快乐，世界出了什么问题将帮助你看到福音如何对我们的世界的心痛和我们每个人内心的痛苦说话。这本新发布的书，《世界出了什么问题》是我们本月感谢你捐赠的礼物，以帮助福音与生活分享耶稣的好消息。今天在 gospelandlife.com/give 请求你的副本。这是 gospelandlife.com/give。

### 被击打的磐石

将会有一个执行。也将会有一个审判，因为长老们也去了。如果你对旧约了解很多，你知道神会不断地做的事情是，当有人是罪犯时，他们必须在长老和杖面前出现。这就是他们被审判的方式。如果他们被判有罪，就会受到惩罚。所以将会有一个审判，但谁呢？好吧，这里有个奇怪的事情。不是摩西，尽管摩西的生命岌岌可危，摩西是被指控的人。摩西的生命岌岌可危，但摩西有杖。所以他不是那个将站在被告席上的人。他不会在被告的位置上。所以不是摩西。那么会是谁呢？可能是以色列的子民吗？你看，有人说，为什么？他们没有做错什么。哦，是的，他们做了。哦，我的，他们做了。以色列的子民欠神和摩西的一切。神来了。摩西通过神的强大行为和摩西的勇敢来到了。他们通过神的强大行为被带出埃及。他们欠神的一切。而现在他们在这里说，我不喜欢神管理我们生活的方式。我们想要回到统治。我们想要推翻神。我们不喜欢他做事的方式。他们应该说，神为什么对我们这么好，但他们却在说，你最近为我做了什么？他们在说，我们不喜欢你管理我们生活的方式。所以他们实际上犯了他们指控摩西的叛国罪。他们应该在被告席上。他们应该接受审判。但那不是谁在接受审判。谁在接受审判？看第6节，我说，神将在何烈的磐石那里站在你面前。现在听着，亲爱的朋友们，圣经中的每个地方，尤其是在古代，谁站在谁面前是非常重要的。站在面前的人总是处于仆人的位置。仆人站在主人面前。弱者站在强者面前。被告站在法官面前。在整个圣经中没有其他地方有神站在任何人面前。人们站在他面前。不，他从不站在任何人面前。他可能站在谁面前？这就是为什么他说，走在我面前。这就是为什么在旧约中，当有人被带到审判时，他们被告知要站在耶和华和以色列的长老面前。但在一个绝对惊人的声明中，神说，我将在你面前站立。你有杖。神在做什么？然后他说，我将在磐石旁站立。现在，希伯来语介词说在磐石上或在磐石上。我们使用的翻译，新国际版，这是我们在这里使用的英语翻译，几乎害怕说出它实际上说的是什么。神说，我将在磐石上，在磐石上，在磐石上。他们说在磐石旁是一样的。我将在磐石上站立，把神的杖举起来，击打磐石。执行。神进入被告席。神进入软弱的位置。神进入定罪的位置。听着，摩西实际上无法用物理的棍子伤害神。但你能想象他一定有多惊讶吗？你知道为什么吗？每当神的存在显现时，你都要表现出最大的尊重。记得当摩西接近燃烧的荆棘时，神说什么？脱下你的鞋子。你在圣地。每当神的存在在周围时，你都要以最大的尊重对待它。但这里是神说，我将在磐石上站在你面前。击打它。击打磐石。把神的杖降在我身上。摩西一定比他一生中任何时候都更惊讶，他会说，这怎么可能？但我们知道这怎么可能。因为在哥林多前书10章，保罗说，我们的祖先经过红海，他们吃了同样的属灵食物，他们喝了同样的属灵饮料，因为他们喝的是从磐石流出的水，那磐石就是基督。这里发生了什么。摩西被定罪。他在为自己的生命接受审判。神进入摩西的位置。人民应该被定罪。他们犯了叛国罪。神站在他们的位置。神在磐石上。神在被告席上。被告席。他是被告。他进来了。神在磐石上。神在被告席上。他被执行。现在你看，朋友们，那天没有发生。不，没有。这是一个预示。但有一天，有人在十字架上，那是磐石，抬头望向天堂说，我的神，我的神，同样的杖把尼罗河的血洒出来，现在洒我的血。同样的杖把尼罗河变成血，现在把我变成血。为什么？因为我们把神放在被告席上，我们应该进入被告席，但神实际上进入被告席并为我们承担惩罚。关于《约拿的记号》这部戏剧最令人惊讶的事情之一。在结尾，记得我说过他们处理它的方式是说这是神的问题。神是责任。神是那个。现在这只是愚蠢。你不明白吗？我们不想在自己的生活中看。我们不想在自己的心中看。我们不想说这个世界的邪恶和死亡营的痛苦是我们的错。我们不想这样做。所以我们所做的是试图把神放在被告席上。我们应该因为把神放在被告席上而被放在被告席上，但神自己进去并承担我们应得的打击。最有趣的是在《约拿的记号》这部戏剧中，在结尾，他们说你是对的。神是责任。不是我们，他们说让我们判他死刑。你知道他们说什么吗？这是他们说的。说让他成为一个人。让他成为一个无家可归的人。让他成为地球上的流浪者。让他失去他的儿子。让他死。当他死时，让他被嘲笑和羞辱。等等。等等。他做了。他已经做了。哦，主，神，你为什么不对这个世界的痛苦做点什么？神做了其他宗教甚至不声称他们的神做过的事情。没有其他宗教声称他们的神做过这件事。圣经说我们的神对痛苦和邪恶做了一些事情。他来到它的底部。他潜入。他跳入。你知道那首不可思议的基督教诗歌说其他神骑马，但你，耶稣基督，跌跌撞撞地走向王座。只有你的伤口能对我们的伤口说话。唯一的神。唯一对痛苦和邪恶做了些什么的神来到这里并承担了我们应得的惩罚。他做到了。他做了我们在自怜和傲慢中对神要求的事情。神实际上来了，我可以通过做你要求我做的事情来拯救你，但你的要求是邪恶的事情。它值得审判，但我会自己承担审判。如果你阅读那些美国士兵的目击者报告，唯一的原因是他们开枪，他们只是开始射击和殴打守卫。你知道为什么吗？因为他们在心底知道，处理这种不可思议的邪恶的唯一方法是审判。他们需要看到审判。这是一个只能通过审判来处理的伤口。世界的邪恶，世界的罪恶，只能通过审判来完成。但通过非人化，通过去人化守卫，他们阻止自己意识到我们都应该被审判。神通过审判处理了这个世界的痛苦和邪恶。他来了并亲自承担了审判。你看这意味着什么吗？如果你谦卑自己并说，主，我应该被击打，但你为我被击打。那么在最后一天，神可以处理，他可以消灭邪恶而不消灭你。神总是可以把杖降在邪恶上，但那样他就把我们都消灭了。如果你相信他，他可以消灭邪恶，他将在最后一天消灭邪恶而不消灭你。你听到他了吗？现在，这是最后要说的事情。水从被击打的磐石流出。水从被击打的磐石流出。你知道这意味着什么吗？如果你看耶稣基督，为你被击打。神在磐石上，神在被告席上，如果你看到他为你被击打，如果你看到他被神的杖变成血，水就会流出。它使你能够处理你的旷野，它使你能够处理你的沙漠。你注意到神没有把以色列人带出沙漠。他在沙漠中给了他们一个供应。在他回来之前，我们没有被带出这个世界的痛苦，但我们在其中得到了一个供应。那是什么？被击打的磐石的景象。朋友们，如果你看到被击打的磐石，那将使你能够面对生活的旷野。你说，怎么做到的？好吧，像这样，当你看到被击打的磐石，现在你知道他是公义的。他是如此公义。他是如此的法官，以至于他必须亲自来被击打，如果他要原谅我们。你知道这意味着什么吗？你不必看世界的邪恶而感到愤怒。你不必成为一个义务警员。你不必心怀怨恨，因为你会说一切都会得到偿还。一个人要么通过神请求怜悯，神为此付出代价，要么在骄傲中拒绝请求怜悯，他们将为此付出代价，但一切都会得到偿还。你不必心怀怨恨。你不必复仇。你不必在早上看《纽约时报》说，看所有的不公正并感到沮丧。水从磐石流出。当你看到神被击打时，你会知道你有一个平安，神将把一切都放在正确的位置。但这还不是全部。另一个伟大的事情，水从磐石流出。当你看到神被击打时，这意味着我们不再对这个世界的问题被动或宿命论。你知道为什么吗？基督徒是世界上唯一一群有一个神的人，他对生活的破碎感到如此愤怒，以至于他进入其中。对痛苦感到如此愤怒，以至于他进入其中。基督徒有一个战斗的宗教。我们说神不喜欢饥饿。神不喜欢邪恶。神不喜欢不公正。我将与之斗争，我在我父亲的精神中。我在我兄弟耶稣基督的精神中。你不明白吗？这很奇怪的是你可以决定哦，好吧。让我们被动。你得到没有能量的平安。或者你可以说外面很糟糕。你得到没有平安的能量。但如果你看到被击打的磐石，如果你看到神被审判，如果你看到耶稣被击打，一方面，你会得到一种平静，因为一切都会得到处理。神将审判一切。但你也会得到一种好斗和能量。你说，看那个。耶稣基督受苦。他进入痛苦中做点什么。所以我也会。你知道吗？如果你甚至拒绝坐下来听别人的麻烦，因为你知道，哦，我的天，我不想参与。哦，我的。接下来你知道，他们会打电话给我。接下来我不想参与一个忙碌的人。你没有看到耶稣在磐石上。他进入痛苦。当然这对他来说是有代价的。如果你跟随他，这对你来说会有代价。这不会像对他那样对你有代价。但你看到水从磐石流出。如果你看到耶稣为你被击打，当你看到不公正时会有平安，但当你看到痛苦时会有一种好斗和能量。不仅如此，你会知道他如此爱你，以至于他会为你做这件事。你心中会有一种喜悦。你会说，你知道吗？无论我做了什么，他都不会把杖降在我身上。他把杖降在自己身上。他一定非常爱我。水从磐石流出。如果你从中汲取力量，你可以面对任何事情。你可以面对任何旷野。你看到了吗？如果这里有任何人说，你知道，我会成为基督徒，但神必须解释世界上出了什么问题。我会成为基督徒。有人曾经对我说，如果他能告诉我为什么他给了我他给我的父亲。我可以成为基督徒。如果他能解释为什么他允许那些可怕的事情在那个国家发生在那一年，我可以成为基督徒。如果神能解释这些事情，你就把神放在被告席上。你不明白吗？神给了你比解释更伟大的东西。他给了你他的儿子。他给了你他自己的背。他给了你他自己的血。对他说，哦，主，你为我被击打。所以我将建立在你的磐石上。我将基于你为我所做的事情来建立我的生活。让我们祷告。父亲，我们请求你帮助我们看到。你会帮助我们看到。耶稣为我们被击打。神在磐石上，神在被告席上。杖降下来。把我们的儿子，你的儿子，耶稣基督，我们的兄弟，变成血，并帮助我们从中汲取力量，接受从中流出的那种水。这样我们就会有一种平安和能量以及喜悦，使我们能够在这个旷野中快乐地生活，直到你把我们带入你的应许之地，流奶与蜜之地的那一天。我们期待那一天。我们感谢你，跟随我们的磐石是基督。帮助我们从中汲取力量，奉耶稣的名。我们请求，阿门。
