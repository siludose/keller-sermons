### Introduction: The Desire for Change

Are you longing to see real change in your life, in your habits, your relationships, your heart? Today, Tim Keller explores how lasting change actually happens in the life of a Christian, and why the Gospel offers a radically different process of transformation than anything else.

The Scripture passage for tonight is Romans 8, verses 28 through 39:

> "And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose. For those God foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those He predestined, He also called; those He called, He also justified; those He justified, He also glorified."

**What then shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us?** He who did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up for us all—how will He not also, along with Him, graciously give us all things?

### The Three Bases for Joy

Christmas is about joy. We sing about joy to the world. Ever notice that at Christmas we sing about these merry gentlemen and nothing dismays them? It is amazing.

And what we said last week, too, is we are going through Romans 6, 7, and 8, and in this series, we come here to the very end of the passage or the section we are looking at, which is the end of Romans 8.

### Our Bad Things Will Turn Out for Good

First, our bad things will turn out for good. Think of Christmas. Jesus is born into poverty. He's born into danger. You know, His family has to flee to Egypt to escape slaughter. There's no room for Him at the inn.

But out of Jesus' poverty comes the greatest spiritual riches. Out of Jesus' weakness comes the most incredible power and strength. Out of Jesus' isolation and rejection comes the people brought together, united in the deepest love, unity.

> "All things work together for good in the lives of those who love God."

### Our Most Truly Good Things Can Never Be Taken Away

Secondly, our most truly good things can never be taken away from us. Now that's the second thing Christmas shows us. Why?

Well, if anything, Christmas shows us the radical graciousness of God's salvation. The trajectory of human religion is I go to God. I have to ascend through moral effort and through transformations of consciousness or whatever. I must ascend toward God.

### Our Best Things Are Yet to Come

Now the third thing actually we see is in verse 30. If you go through 28, 29, and 30, we see, as we already saw, He foreloves us. He puts His love on us. He calls us. He justifies us, gives us the right relationship with us. And then He glorifies us.

No, actually that's not what it says. It's all past tense. And that's not how we would talk. You see what Paul is saying? Commentators have been noticing this for centuries actually. It's actually very striking.

**Our slight momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison.**

Let's pray.

Father, our bad things will turn out for good. Our most truly good things can never be taken from us, and our best things are yet to come. The realities that Christmas points to become effective in our lives through these truths, let these truths have their way with us, make us real, give us the ability to live meaningful lives, even joyous lives, in the midst of our grief and suffering. We thank you that it's possible through Jesus. It's in His name that we ask it. Amen.

### 引言：对改变的渴望

你是否渴望在生活中看到真正的改变，在你的习惯、关系、内心中？今天，Tim Keller 探讨了基督徒生活中持久改变的实际发生方式，以及为什么福音提供了一种与其他任何东西截然不同的转变过程。

今晚的经文是罗马书 8 章 28 到 39 节：

> “我们晓得万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处，就是按祂旨意被召的人。因为祂预先所知道的人，就预先定下效法祂儿子的模样，使祂儿子在许多弟兄中作长子。预先所定下的人又召他们来，所召来的人又称他们为义，所称为义的人又叫他们得荣耀。”

**既是这样，还有什么说的呢？神若帮助我们，谁能敌挡我们呢？** 神既不爱惜自己的儿子为我们众人舍了，岂不也把万物和祂一同白白地赐给我们吗？

### 喜乐的三个基础

圣诞节是关于喜乐的。我们唱着“普世欢腾”。有没有注意到圣诞节我们唱这些快乐的绅士，没有什么能让他们沮丧？这真是令人惊奇。

我们上周也说过，我们正在通过罗马书 6、7 和 8 章，在这个系列中，我们来到我们正在看的段落或部分的结尾，即罗马书 8 章的结尾。

### 我们的坏事将变为好事

首先，我们的坏事将变为好事。想想圣诞节。耶稣出生在贫穷中。祂出生在危险中。你知道，祂的家人必须逃往埃及以躲避屠杀。客店里没有祂的地方。

但从耶稣的贫穷中产生了最大的属灵财富。从耶稣的软弱中产生了最不可思议的力量和能力。从耶稣的孤立和拒绝中，带来了人们在最深的爱和团结中团结在一起。

> “万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处。”

### 我们最真实的好事永远不会被夺走

其次，我们最真实的好事永远不会被夺走。现在这是圣诞节向我们展示的第二件事。为什么？

好吧，如果有什么，圣诞节向我们展示了神救恩的激进恩典。人类宗教的轨迹是我去找神。我必须通过道德努力和意识的转变等来提升。我必须向神提升。

### 我们最好的事情尚未到来

现在，第三件事实际上我们在第 30 节中看到。如果你通过 28、29 和 30 节，我们看到，正如我们已经看到的，祂预先爱我们。祂把祂的爱放在我们身上。祂召唤我们。祂称我们为义，给我们正确的关系。然后祂荣耀我们。

不，实际上这不是它所说的。这都是过去时。这不是我们会说的方式。你看到保罗在说什么吗？评论家们实际上几个世纪以来一直注意到这一点。这实际上非常引人注目。

**我们这至暂至轻的苦楚，要为我们成就极重无比永远的荣耀。**

让我们祷告。

父啊，我们的坏事将变为好事。我们最真实的好事永远不会被夺走，我们最好的事情尚未到来。圣诞节指向的现实通过这些真理在我们的生活中生效，让这些真理在我们身上发挥作用，使我们真实，给予我们在悲伤和痛苦中过有意义生活，甚至是快乐生活的能力。我们感谢您通过耶稣使这一切成为可能。我们奉祂的名求。阿门。
