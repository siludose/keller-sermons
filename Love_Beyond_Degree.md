## English Transcript / 英文原文

Today, Tim Keller explores how lasting change actually happens in the life of a Christian,  and why the Gospel offers a radically different process of transformation than anything else. The Scripture passes for tonight's Romans 8, verses 28 through 39,  and we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose. For those God for new, He also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of His Son,  that He might be the first born among many brothers, and those He predestined He also called  those He called He also justified, and those He justified He also glorified. What then shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us?

He who did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up for us all. How will He not also, along with Him, graciously give us all things? Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies who is He that condemns. Christ Jesus who died more than that who was raised to life is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us.

Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? As it is written, for your sake, we face death all day long. We are considered as sheep to be slaughtered. No, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.

For I am convinced that neither death nor life, nor angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation  will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. This is the word of the Lord. Christmas is about joy. We sing about joy to the world. Ever notice that Christmas we sing about these Mary gentlemen and nothing dismayes them.

It is amazing. And what we said last week, too, is we are going through Romans 6, 7 and 8 and in this series we come here to the very end of the passage or the section we are looking at which is the end of Romans 8. And as we said last week, one of the problems with Christmas is that if you are bearing burdens, if you are actually struggling with the life issues, real troubles and an awful lot of people are,  Christmas is a tough time because the message is you should have fun. This is Christmas and of course that just makes it worse. And rightly so, I think suffering people at Christmas want to know, what bases does Christmas really give me for joy?

Why should I be married? What bases do I really have for joy that Christmas gives me? And the answer is, if Christmas really happened, if God really did at Christmas open a cleft in the pitied loose walls of this world,  if he broke into our broken reality with this healing power, if he became a human being, if Christmas happened, I'd like to show us that there are three things, three solid bases for joy that Christmas gives us,  that we can have in any circumstances, even in the deepest grief, these three things you can feel holding you up. If Christmas happened, I've been getting into a book that used to be required reading. It's actually called one of the most influential books in the history of Western civilization.

It's a book called The Consolation of Philosophy by Boethius. Boethius was a philosopher and a statesman but he was thrown into prison and he wrote this book when he was actually in prison on trumped up charges waiting to be executed. And the question he poses is, if the world takes everything away from you practically, there is to rejoice in in the world, is there any way to maintain your equilibrium, your hope, and your joy in the face of that? And his answer in the end is yes, and he is a Christian. He comes up with these same three things I'd like to share with you.

And by the way, this passage is a marvelous passage, it's a huge passage, and it also raises what a lot of people would consider kind of thorny issues about free will and predestination and all that sort of stuff. I'll come back to that after Christmas. But you know, I like to give you a gift. Hey, listen, I'm going to give you a gift tonight. You don't have to say, well, how did you get that gift and where did it come from and where did you buy it?

Just enjoy it tonight. There's three things that Christmas, if it's true, and if you believe it's true because you don't have access to this, if you don't believe it. If you believe that what happened to Christmas really happened. There's three things, three solid bases for joy and here's what they are. Our bad things will turn out for good.

Our most truly good things can never be taken away from us, and our best things are yet to come. That's what it tells us. Our bad things will turn out for good. Our most truly good things can never be taken away from us on our best things are yet to come. And if you know those, if you got those, you can face things.

First, our bad things will turn out for good. Think of Christmas. Jesus is born into poverty. He's born into danger. You know, his family has to flee to Egypt to escape slaughter.

There's no room for him at the end. But out of Jesus' poverty comes the greatest spiritual riches. Out of Jesus' weakness comes the most incredible power and strength. Out of Jesus' isolation and rejection comes the people brought together, united in the deepest love, unity. In other words, out of terrible things, through terrible things, because those terrible things have happened comes great good.

And Paul says, Romans 8.28, all things work together for good in the lives of those who love God. All things bad and good, small and little, and big and momentous, all things work together for good to them who love God. Now right away, let me just quickly tell you what this is not saying. This is not a superficial, saccharine view of life that says, oh, behind every cloud there's a silver lining. Here are these bad things, but they're not really bad.

If you learn how to look at them in a certain perspective, no. At the tomb of Lazarus, Jesus' friend Lazarus is dead. He goes to the tomb. People all around him are weeping. Jesus is about to do exactly what Paul's talking about in Romans 8.28.

He's going to, out of all this bad, he's going to bring something good. He's going to bring glory and joy into the world that wouldn't have been there if Lazarus hadn't died. So he's going to bring good out of the bad. He's going to make it work out for good, but he's not chuckling at the tomb. Jesus doesn't come up to the tomb going, wait, do you guys see what I'm about to do?

He's not chuckling. He's not saying, oh, I'm going to raise him from the dead. He's weeping with those who weep. We're told he's angry at the tomb. He's bellows and anger when he comes to the tomb.

You know, Jesus, the tomb in John 11 almost forces you. The view of Jesus there almost forces you to think of Dylan Thomas, the great Welsh poets,  line, famous line. He says, do not go silent into that night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light. And that's what Jesus is doing there.

He's raging against the dying. He's death which separates soul from body. Injustice, the separates race from race or person from person. All things that God has joined together, all things that put things a sunder,  that God has brought together, are bad, they're bad. They're evil in themselves.

They're not just, oh, they have a silver lining or if you just look at them in another way,  they're not really bad. They're bad. It's terrible. Jesus hates them. He's weeping.

He's angry at them. But Romans 8.28 says the way God defeats those really, truly bad things  is some total altogether. God is overruling, shaping, mastering everything. So in the end, he defeats bad because somehow he's going to make all the bad  and everything working together to bring about good results in your life. And the question you might say is how?

And of course, I think there's one way in which God does this,  which is relatively easy to grasp. And there's another way in which God does this, which is impossible to understand. The one way that's fairly easy to grasp is actually right here. Verse 28 says he works all things for good. In verse 29 he says that his whole plan for us is to conform us to the likeness of his son.

Now that's the part that we can grasp and that's this. You may think your biggest problem are your circumstances. You may think my biggest problem is if I could just make the money,  if I could just get the job, if this door would open,  you think your problems are the circumstances. But circumstances cannot destroy your life. The way character flaws can.

It's your character that is your real problem. That's what will destroy you really. It's foolishness and pride and selfishness and denial about your sins and your flaws. And hardness of heart, and most of all, the false delusion that you really can make,  you can handle life without God. All those mistakes, those flaws and character, those are the things,  which almost always, it takes bad stuff to knock out of us.

Almost all of us that have been alive more than two or three decades, no offense to anybody. Those of us who have been alive two or three decades or more than two or three decades,  there are things that have happened to us and we have scars and they're bad and they still hurt,  and yet the insight or the character or the strength that we've gotten from it,  we wouldn't trade for anything. And that's just a hint of what we're being told here. All kinds of bad things are going to happen to you through which God is going to conform you to the likeness of His Son. And there's no joy without that conformity.

So you say, okay, is that exhausted? Is that it? I mean, all the bad things are just going to make me a better person? No, it can't because there's another sense of which God is obviously working all things together for good  that will always escape us. And you have to know it if you're going to be able to handle the troubles of life.

You have to know God is working all things together for good and you couldn't possibly grasp how. To me, still, the primary, premier place where you can see this. And I'll speak for myself. I won't confess your sins, I'll confess mine. If I was at the foot of the cross, that dark afternoon, like a lot of people.

And I knew what everybody else knew and only what everybody else knew. He was a really good man. He was a powerful man. Here's a man who had tremendous power to do good. He was healing people.

He was feeding people. He had enormous potential. And yet he's cut off in the middle of his life, 33 years old, tragic death. And it's clear that God had abandoned him. In fact, he says God has forsaken him.

So with all the facts that everybody else had, if I was there, I would have looked up and I would have said,  I don't see what good God could possibly be bringing out of this. And I would have gone home losing my faith perhaps, at least shaken, maybe losing it. Because I couldn't fit how God was bringing enormous good. That was the greatest thing that God had ever would ever do for the human race. Because it didn't fit into my little brain patterns and my little categories.

I would have said, I don't see what God could possibly be doing. In other words, if you've got an infinite God, of course you could have reasons for why he's allowing something that you can't consider. That you can't understand. It's the height of arrogance not to think about that. So if that's what I would have done at the foot of the cross, and my guess is that's probably what you would have done at the foot of the cross,  when you feel abandoned, when everything seems like it's happening to you,  you can't see any good reason why in the world it would happen, don't you dare make the same mistake.

Don't make the same mistake. Our bad things will turn out for good. That's one very important thing to grasp, and Christmas shows us that. Secondly though, our most truly good things can never be taken away from us. Now that's the second thing Christmas shows us.

Why? Well, if anything, Christmas shows us the radical graciousness of God's salvation. The trajectory of human religion is I code God. I have to ascend through moral effort and through transformations of consciousness or whatever. I must ascend toward God.

Then he will bless me. If I live the life I ought to live, then he will bless me and save me. But the trajectory of the gospel is from God to us. See, at Christmas, God is basically saying, you're never going to get up to me. I've got to come down to you.

You're just never going to make it. And therefore he traverses the entire chasm between humanity and God. He comes all the way. He comes all the way right to us. And when Jesus comes, he comes poor and weak.

William Billings, that great hymn. There's that great line where William Billings says, seek not in courts nor palaces nor royal curtains draw. But search the stable. See your God. Extend it on the straw.

God, extend it on the straw. See, why does God come not as a general on the head of an army? Not as a king on a throne? Why does he come poor and weak? I'll tell you why.

He does not come as a strong one for the strong. He's not a God who helps those who help themselves. No way. He comes for people who are weak and who can't do what we need to do. So he comes to suffer.

He comes to die. He comes to pay the penalty for our sins. He comes, therefore, to give us love, salvation benefits that are unconditional. Because they're not based on us, any condition in us. It's love beyond condition.

It's love beyond degree. And that's what this passage is all about. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God. Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365-day devotional, the songs of Jesus,  you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight.

If you don't have a regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start. And if you already spend time in study and prayer,  then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest emotions  and questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with Him. We'll send you Tim and Kathy Keller's devotional as our thanks for your gift  to help Gospel and Life share the love of Jesus with more people.

So, for example, look at that place where it says,  he foreknows us. What do you think that means? You might say, oh, foreknows means he foresees us. No. Just keep this in mind.

Knowing in the Bible is a very relational word. To know about something is a cognitive thing. To know something is an experiential thing. You can know about someone, but not know them. And therefore, when it says God foreknows us,  what it's really saying is not that he foresees us, but he foreloves us.

He puts his love on us before we do anything in his direction. That's how unconditional and aggressive his love is. So, if you want a perfect example of it, the prodigal son. You know, here comes the prodigal son. Does the father sit there and say, does he stay on the porch tapping his foot,  saying, this better be good?

Does the father say, if he repents, then I'll shower him with love? No. He runs to him and he kisses him and pounces on him and showers him with love,  enabling him, making it far easier to repent. Our love does not evoke God's love. God's love evokes ours.

That's how radical and that's how unconditional it is. And if you say, well, what about free will? I told you I'd come back. Why don't you just accept the gift right now? And here's what the gift is.

Here's what the gift is. God's not just a boss. He's a father. A boss can like an employee. But if that employee screws up over and over and over again,  even the nicest boss starts to say, how do I get rid of her?

How do I get rid of him? Even the nicest boss, if he screws up over and over and over again,  he starts to say, how am I going to get rid of him? But when a child screws up over and over again, all that does is make the parent  more intensely concerned about the child. It intensifies the love of the parent. It focuses the love of the parent.

The more you screw up, the more your parental love explodes in the direction of the child. And that means what? The really great things that you have. Your justification, we talked about this, made right with him. Your adoption into the family.

Your relationship with him. These things can't be taken away from you. See, nothing it says at the very end. In all creation, inside you or outside you can separate you from the love of God. That means that the absolute sovereign of the universe,  to whom the galaxies are like dust on the scales,  loves you with the unconditional intensity of a parent.

That's the second thing. And Christmas shows us this. Your bad things will turn out for good. Your most truly good things can never be taken away from you. And the best things are yet to come.

Now the third thing actually we see is in verse 30. If you go through 28, 29 and 30,  we see, as we already saw, he for loves us. He puts his love on us. He calls us. He justifies us, gives us the right relationship with us.

And then he glorifies us. No, actually that's not what it says. It's all past tense. And that's not how we would talk. You see what Paul is saying?

Commentators have been noticing this for centuries actually. It's actually very striking. What you and I would say is talking to Christians. He put his love on you. He called you.

He justified you. He pardoned you. And someday he will glorify you. That's not what Paul says. He says he's already glorified you.

Past tense. Past tense? Here's what he's saying. First of all, our future glory,  because of what Jesus Christ has done,  has been made so certain,  he can talk about it this way. It is so certain.

You say, how could it be that certain? We've got him, you know, that goes like this. It's where God is speaking. It's a how firm a foundation. And the last lines go,  that soul that on Jesus has leaned for repose.

I will not, I will not desert to its foes. That soul, though, all hell should endeavor to shake. I'll never, no, never, never forsake. That word. There is the key.

How is it possible that God could never forsake us? Because Jesus on the cross said,  you forsaken me. Jesus was forsaken in our place,  so that we will never be forsaken. Or another way to put it,  is Jesus lost the glory. Philippians 2, he emptied himself of his glory.

Isaiah 53, he had no beauty by which we should desire him. He absolutely lost his glory. He became pitiful. He became small, shriveled. He became inconsequential.

He lost all his glory so that we could have it so certainly,  so assuredly, that Paul can talk about it in the past tense. Now, if that's the case,  that I believe Paul is saying,  as I read this entire chapter,  and we talked about this somewhat last week as well. Here's what I think Paul is saying. Paul is saying, I believe so much in the brutality of life. I do not have rose-colored glasses.

I don't have a kind of mind-over-matter idea about this. I would never say, oh, you know, things aren't so bad  if you just learned to look at it this way. I so believe in the brutality of life,  the inevitable brutality of life,  that unless I knew there was glory coming to me,  I would not be able to lead a meaningful life  in the midst of all this suffering. Paul is saying, only glory makes it possible  to realistically face how bad life is  and live a meaningful life in the midst of it,  even a triumphant life in the midst of it,  only knowing what he says here,  and up in verse 18,  and over in 2 Corinthians 4,  where he says, I consider that the suffering of this present time  is not worthy to be compared  with the glory that will be revealed in us. I believe he says in 2 Corinthians 4,  the suffering of this present time is preparing  a weight of glory for us,  for as our outward nature waits away,  our inward is being renewed every day.

What is he talking about? There's two things. It's how we're going to close. The first of all, he's saying,  if you understand what Paul is saying here,  he's saying, that when we suffer in Christ,  holding on to Christ,  it makes us more real. I mean, it makes us more real.

Because the word glory,  animologically,  means weighty or solid. And actually, if you think about this,  we've been talking about this all through this series. If everybody loves their,  your career is important to everybody. And so if you have problems in your career,  it's going to shake you. But if you've completely built your life on your career,  if your whole identity is in your career,  then when something goes wrong with your career,  you're going to be shattered.

Just shattered. You know you left. No self left. And that's the reason that instead of putting our weight  on things that are always shifting around  and always shaking,  when you put your weight on the rock,  when you root yourself more firmly in the love of God  and what he says about you,  what he's done for you,  you become more solid,  you become more stable,  you become actually more real. That is to say,  you actually become something someone  who's going to last, no matter what.

Suffering when it gets you more deeply into God,  when it drives you more deeply into God  and into what he's done for you,  it makes you more real. Now the reason I know that Paul's right  is because the Velveteen Rabbit agrees with him. So for example,  the skin horse says to the Velveteen Rabbit,  when a child loves you for a long, long time,  then you become real. Does it hurt? Ask the Velveteen Rabbit?

Oh yes, to the skin horse. That's why it doesn't happen to those who break easily  or who have to be very carefully handled. By the time you are real,  most of your hair has been loved off  and your eyes drop out,  and you get really loose in the joints,  and you look awfully shabby. But once you are real,  you can't be ugly,  except to the people who don't understand. And you know that John Newton hymn  that goes where God is speaking to us basically,  and the John Newton hymn where God says,  these inward trials,  these inward trials I employ  from pride and self to set thee free  and break thy schemes of earthly joy  that thou mayst find thine all in me.

See, first of all,  suffering is actually making him more glorious now. Your inward person is being renewed day by day. Glory is preparing a weight of glory now,  but not only that,  the future glory overwhelms. Overwhelms. As we think about it, Paul says,  I reckon that the suffering in his present time  is not worthy to be compared with the glory  that should be revealed to us.

The future glory overwhelms  and puts perspective  and enables us to face what we've gotten in front of us. That's the reason why St. Teresa of Avala was able to say,  the first kiss from Jesus,  the first second of glory,  is going to make all the suffering you've ever experienced,  seem like one night in a bad hotel. That's the reason why Dostoevsky is going to be able to say,  I believe that suffering will be healed and made up for it,  that in the world's finale,  at the moment of eternal harmony,  something so precious will come to pass,  that it will suffice for all hearts  for the comforting of all resentments,  for the atonement of all the crimes of humanity,  of all the blood that they've shed,  that it will make it not just possible to forgive,  but to justify everything that's happened. That's awfully radical,  but something like that is what Paul's talking about.

Now, let me draw it all together. Do you understand that this glory is already making you,  pardon me, the suffering can already be making you glorious  and someday we'll be overshadowed by the glory  that is to be revealed? There's a metaphor that kind of a story  that CS Lewis gives us that draws all of this together,  and I'm just going to read it to you,  and not going to comment on it. There's a place where Flenery O'Connor was once asked,  could you tell us the meaning of your story? Could you just put it in one line, one sentence,  and she said,  if I could put it in one line or sentence,  I wouldn't have had to write the story.

And I have to say the same thing about this. Don't ask me what it means. It means more than I can tell you. It's about a ghost from hell,  not very real, you know. Who comes to the Oscars of Heaven,  this is a fiction, by the way,  and is looking longingly toward Heaven,  and an angel comes down to try to meet him,  but he's got a little red lizard on his shoulder,  and the lizard doesn't want to go,  so that ghost turns around very sadly to leave.

And the angel calls and says,  hey, why are you leaving so soon? And the ghost says, well,  this little fella here doesn't really want to go in that direction  so I can't. And the angel says,  would you like me to make it quiet? And the ghost says, well, it would be a relief. Then I will kill him, said the angel.

Oh, you didn't say anything about killing it. It's the only way, said the angel. May I kill it? Well, let's discuss that. There is no time.

May I kill it? Oh, look, it's gone to sleep. I'm sure it won't be any trouble anymore. Yes, it will. May I kill it?

Well, I think the gradual process is always better than,  no, the gradual process is of no use at all. May I kill it? Get back! You're hurting me. You didn't tell me it would hurt me.

I never said it wouldn't hurt you. I said it wouldn't kill you. May I kill it? Look, let me run back by tonight's bus  and get an opinion from my own doctor,  come to you the first moment I can. This moment contains all moments.

May I kill it? And then the lizard began chattering to the ghost,  so loud that everyone could hear what it was saying. He can do it. He can kill me. And then what would you do without me?

Oh, I admit, I've sometimes gone too far in the past,  but I promise I won't do it again. I'll be very good. May I kill it? Said the angel. Oh, do it.

Do it. Get it over with, cry the ghost. But God helped me. God helped me. Then the angel grabbed hold of the lizard  and broke its neck and threw it down  and the ghost screams and two amazing things happen.

First of all, the ghost stops being ghostly  and becomes radiant and gorgeous and bright and real  and a human being, a man. But the body of the red lizard, instead of disappearing,  it grows into a beautiful, powerful white horse. And the text goes on,  when the new-made man arose,  I thought his face shone with tears,  but it may have been only the liquid love  and brightness which flowed from him. Enjoy his haste. The man leaped upon the horse's back.

They were off like a shooting star on the green plane  and were soon to the mountains. Still like a star,  I saw them winding up,  scaling what seemed impossible steps quicker every moment  until the brow of the landscape,  so high that I strained my neck to see them,  they vanished,  bright themselves into the rose brightness  of that everlasting morning. Our slight momentary affliction  is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory  beyond all comparison. I am persuaded that neither death,  nor life, nor angels,  nor principalities,  nor powers, nor things present,  nor anything to come,  nor height, nor depth,  nor anything in all creation  is able to separate us from the love of God,  which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Let's pray.

Father, our bad things will turn out for good. Our most truly good things can never be taken from us  and our best things are yet to come. The realities that Christmas points to  become effective in our lives through these truths,  let these truths have their way with us,  make us real,  give us the ability to live meaningful lives,  even joyous lives,  in the midst of our grief and suffering. We thank you that it's possible through Jesus. It's in His name that we ask it.

Amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

Today, Tim Keller explores how lasting change actually happens in the life of a Christian,  and why the Gospel offers a radically different process of transformation than anything else. The Scripture passes for tonight's Romans 8, verses 28 through 39,  and we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose. For those God for new, He also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of His Son,  that He might be the first born among many brothers, and those He predestined He also called  those He called He also justified, and those He justified He also glorified. What then shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us?

He who did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up for us all. How will He not also, along with Him, graciously give us all things? Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies who is He that condemns. Christ Jesus who died more than that who was raised to life is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us.

Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? As it is written, for your sake, we face death all day long. We are considered as sheep to be slaughtered. No, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.

For I am convinced that neither death nor life, nor angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation  will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. This is the word of the Lord. Christmas is about joy. We sing about joy to the world. Ever notice that Christmas we sing about these Mary gentlemen and nothing dismayes them.

It is amazing. And what we said last week, too, is we are going through Romans 6, 7 and 8 and in this series we come here to the very end of the passage or the section we are looking at which is the end of Romans 8. And as we said last week, one of the problems with Christmas is that if you are bearing burdens, if you are actually struggling with the life issues, real troubles and an awful lot of people are,  Christmas is a tough time because the message is you should have fun. This is Christmas and of course that just makes it worse. And rightly so, I think suffering people at Christmas want to know, what bases does Christmas really give me for joy?

Why should I be married? What bases do I really have for joy that Christmas gives me? And the answer is, if Christmas really happened, if God really did at Christmas open a cleft in the pitied loose walls of this world,  if he broke into our broken reality with this healing power, if he became a human being, if Christmas happened, I'd like to show us that there are three things, three solid bases for joy that Christmas gives us,  that we can have in any circumstances, even in the deepest grief, these three things you can feel holding you up. If Christmas happened, I've been getting into a book that used to be required reading. It's actually called one of the most influential books in the history of Western civilization.

It's a book called The Consolation of Philosophy by Boethius. Boethius was a philosopher and a statesman but he was thrown into prison and he wrote this book when he was actually in prison on trumped up charges waiting to be executed. And the question he poses is, if the world takes everything away from you practically, there is to rejoice in in the world, is there any way to maintain your equilibrium, your hope, and your joy in the face of that? And his answer in the end is yes, and he is a Christian. He comes up with these same three things I'd like to share with you.

And by the way, this passage is a marvelous passage, it's a huge passage, and it also raises what a lot of people would consider kind of thorny issues about free will and predestination and all that sort of stuff. I'll come back to that after Christmas. But you know, I like to give you a gift. Hey, listen, I'm going to give you a gift tonight. You don't have to say, well, how did you get that gift and where did it come from and where did you buy it?

Just enjoy it tonight. There's three things that Christmas, if it's true, and if you believe it's true because you don't have access to this, if you don't believe it. If you believe that what happened to Christmas really happened. There's three things, three solid bases for joy and here's what they are. Our bad things will turn out for good.

Our most truly good things can never be taken away from us, and our best things are yet to come. That's what it tells us. Our bad things will turn out for good. Our most truly good things can never be taken away from us on our best things are yet to come. And if you know those, if you got those, you can face things.

First, our bad things will turn out for good. Think of Christmas. Jesus is born into poverty. He's born into danger. You know, his family has to flee to Egypt to escape slaughter.

There's no room for him at the end. But out of Jesus' poverty comes the greatest spiritual riches. Out of Jesus' weakness comes the most incredible power and strength. Out of Jesus' isolation and rejection comes the people brought together, united in the deepest love, unity. In other words, out of terrible things, through terrible things, because those terrible things have happened comes great good.

And Paul says, Romans 8.28, all things work together for good in the lives of those who love God. All things bad and good, small and little, and big and momentous, all things work together for good to them who love God. Now right away, let me just quickly tell you what this is not saying. This is not a superficial, saccharine view of life that says, oh, behind every cloud there's a silver lining. Here are these bad things, but they're not really bad.

If you learn how to look at them in a certain perspective, no. At the tomb of Lazarus, Jesus' friend Lazarus is dead. He goes to the tomb. People all around him are weeping. Jesus is about to do exactly what Paul's talking about in Romans 8.28.

He's going to, out of all this bad, he's going to bring something good. He's going to bring glory and joy into the world that wouldn't have been there if Lazarus hadn't died. So he's going to bring good out of the bad. He's going to make it work out for good, but he's not chuckling at the tomb. Jesus doesn't come up to the tomb going, wait, do you guys see what I'm about to do?

He's not chuckling. He's not saying, oh, I'm going to raise him from the dead. He's weeping with those who weep. We're told he's angry at the tomb. He's bellows and anger when he comes to the tomb.

You know, Jesus, the tomb in John 11 almost forces you. The view of Jesus there almost forces you to think of Dylan Thomas, the great Welsh poets,  line, famous line. He says, do not go silent into that night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light. And that's what Jesus is doing there.

He's raging against the dying. He's death which separates soul from body. Injustice, the separates race from race or person from person. All things that God has joined together, all things that put things a sunder,  that God has brought together, are bad, they're bad. They're evil in themselves.

They're not just, oh, they have a silver lining or if you just look at them in another way,  they're not really bad. They're bad. It's terrible. Jesus hates them. He's weeping.

He's angry at them. But Romans 8.28 says the way God defeats those really, truly bad things  is some total altogether. God is overruling, shaping, mastering everything. So in the end, he defeats bad because somehow he's going to make all the bad  and everything working together to bring about good results in your life. And the question you might say is how?

And of course, I think there's one way in which God does this,  which is relatively easy to grasp. And there's another way in which God does this, which is impossible to understand. The one way that's fairly easy to grasp is actually right here. Verse 28 says he works all things for good. In verse 29 he says that his whole plan for us is to conform us to the likeness of his son.

Now that's the part that we can grasp and that's this. You may think your biggest problem are your circumstances. You may think my biggest problem is if I could just make the money,  if I could just get the job, if this door would open,  you think your problems are the circumstances. But circumstances cannot destroy your life. The way character flaws can.

It's your character that is your real problem. That's what will destroy you really. It's foolishness and pride and selfishness and denial about your sins and your flaws. And hardness of heart, and most of all, the false delusion that you really can make,  you can handle life without God. All those mistakes, those flaws and character, those are the things,  which almost always, it takes bad stuff to knock out of us.

Almost all of us that have been alive more than two or three decades, no offense to anybody. Those of us who have been alive two or three decades or more than two or three decades,  there are things that have happened to us and we have scars and they're bad and they still hurt,  and yet the insight or the character or the strength that we've gotten from it,  we wouldn't trade for anything. And that's just a hint of what we're being told here. All kinds of bad things are going to happen to you through which God is going to conform you to the likeness of His Son. And there's no joy without that conformity.

So you say, okay, is that exhausted? Is that it? I mean, all the bad things are just going to make me a better person? No, it can't because there's another sense of which God is obviously working all things together for good  that will always escape us. And you have to know it if you're going to be able to handle the troubles of life.

You have to know God is working all things together for good and you couldn't possibly grasp how. To me, still, the primary, premier place where you can see this. And I'll speak for myself. I won't confess your sins, I'll confess mine. If I was at the foot of the cross, that dark afternoon, like a lot of people.

And I knew what everybody else knew and only what everybody else knew. He was a really good man. He was a powerful man. Here's a man who had tremendous power to do good. He was healing people.

He was feeding people. He had enormous potential. And yet he's cut off in the middle of his life, 33 years old, tragic death. And it's clear that God had abandoned him. In fact, he says God has forsaken him.

So with all the facts that everybody else had, if I was there, I would have looked up and I would have said,  I don't see what good God could possibly be bringing out of this. And I would have gone home losing my faith perhaps, at least shaken, maybe losing it. Because I couldn't fit how God was bringing enormous good. That was the greatest thing that God had ever would ever do for the human race. Because it didn't fit into my little brain patterns and my little categories.

I would have said, I don't see what God could possibly be doing. In other words, if you've got an infinite God, of course you could have reasons for why he's allowing something that you can't consider. That you can't understand. It's the height of arrogance not to think about that. So if that's what I would have done at the foot of the cross, and my guess is that's probably what you would have done at the foot of the cross,  when you feel abandoned, when everything seems like it's happening to you,  you can't see any good reason why in the world it would happen, don't you dare make the same mistake.

Don't make the same mistake. Our bad things will turn out for good. That's one very important thing to grasp, and Christmas shows us that. Secondly though, our most truly good things can never be taken away from us. Now that's the second thing Christmas shows us.

Why? Well, if anything, Christmas shows us the radical graciousness of God's salvation. The trajectory of human religion is I code God. I have to ascend through moral effort and through transformations of consciousness or whatever. I must ascend toward God.

Then he will bless me. If I live the life I ought to live, then he will bless me and save me. But the trajectory of the gospel is from God to us. See, at Christmas, God is basically saying, you're never going to get up to me. I've got to come down to you.

You're just never going to make it. And therefore he traverses the entire chasm between humanity and God. He comes all the way. He comes all the way right to us. And when Jesus comes, he comes poor and weak.

William Billings, that great hymn. There's that great line where William Billings says, seek not in courts nor palaces nor royal curtains draw. But search the stable. See your God. Extend it on the straw.

God, extend it on the straw. See, why does God come not as a general on the head of an army? Not as a king on a throne? Why does he come poor and weak? I'll tell you why.

He does not come as a strong one for the strong. He's not a God who helps those who help themselves. No way. He comes for people who are weak and who can't do what we need to do. So he comes to suffer.

He comes to die. He comes to pay the penalty for our sins. He comes, therefore, to give us love, salvation benefits that are unconditional. Because they're not based on us, any condition in us. It's love beyond condition.

It's love beyond degree. And that's what this passage is all about. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God. Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365-day devotional, the songs of Jesus,  you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight.

If you don't have a regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start. And if you already spend time in study and prayer,  then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest emotions  and questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with Him. We'll send you Tim and Kathy Keller's devotional as our thanks for your gift  to help Gospel and Life share the love of Jesus with more people. Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash give. That's gospelandlife.com slash give.

So, for example, look at that place where it says,  he foreknows us. What do you think that means? You might say, oh, foreknows means he foresees us. No. Just keep this in mind.

Knowing in the Bible is a very relational word. To know about something is a cognitive thing. To know something is an experiential thing. You can know about someone, but not know them. And therefore, when it says God foreknows us,  what it's really saying is not that he foresees us, but he foreloves us.

He puts his love on us before we do anything in his direction. That's how unconditional and aggressive his love is. So, if you want a perfect example of it, the prodigal son. You know, here comes the prodigal son. Does the father sit there and say, does he stay on the porch tapping his foot,  saying, this better be good?

Does the father say, if he repents, then I'll shower him with love? No. He runs to him and he kisses him and pounces on him and showers him with love,  enabling him, making it far easier to repent. Our love does not evoke God's love. God's love evokes ours.

That's how radical and that's how unconditional it is. And if you say, well, what about free will? I told you I'd come back. Why don't you just accept the gift right now? And here's what the gift is.

Here's what the gift is. God's not just a boss. He's a father. A boss can like an employee. But if that employee screws up over and over and over again,  even the nicest boss starts to say, how do I get rid of her?

How do I get rid of him? Even the nicest boss, if he screws up over and over and over again,  he starts to say, how am I going to get rid of him? But when a child screws up over and over again, all that does is make the parent  more intensely concerned about the child. It intensifies the love of the parent. It focuses the love of the parent.

The more you screw up, the more your parental love explodes in the direction of the child. And that means what? The really great things that you have. Your justification, we talked about this, made right with him. Your adoption into the family.

Your relationship with him. These things can't be taken away from you. See, nothing it says at the very end. In all creation, inside you or outside you can separate you from the love of God. That means that the absolute sovereign of the universe,  to whom the galaxies are like dust on the scales,  loves you with the unconditional intensity of a parent.

That's the second thing. And Christmas shows us this. Your bad things will turn out for good. Your most truly good things can never be taken away from you. And the best things are yet to come.

Now the third thing actually we see is in verse 30. If you go through 28, 29 and 30,  we see, as we already saw, he for loves us. He puts his love on us. He calls us. He justifies us, gives us the right relationship with us.

And then he glorifies us. No, actually that's not what it says. It's all past tense. And that's not how we would talk. You see what Paul is saying?

Commentators have been noticing this for centuries actually. It's actually very striking. What you and I would say is talking to Christians. He put his love on you. He called you.

He justified you. He pardoned you. And someday he will glorify you. That's not what Paul says. He says he's already glorified you.

Past tense. Past tense? Here's what he's saying. First of all, our future glory,  because of what Jesus Christ has done,  has been made so certain,  he can talk about it this way. It is so certain.

You say, how could it be that certain? We've got him, you know, that goes like this. It's where God is speaking. It's a how firm a foundation. And the last lines go,  that soul that on Jesus has leaned for repose.

I will not, I will not desert to its foes. That soul, though, all hell should endeavor to shake. I'll never, no, never, never forsake. That word. There is the key.

How is it possible that God could never forsake us? Because Jesus on the cross said,  you forsaken me. Jesus was forsaken in our place,  so that we will never be forsaken. Or another way to put it,  is Jesus lost the glory. Philippians 2, he emptied himself of his glory.

Isaiah 53, he had no beauty by which we should desire him. He absolutely lost his glory. He became pitiful. He became small, shriveled. He became inconsequential.

He lost all his glory so that we could have it so certainly,  so assuredly, that Paul can talk about it in the past tense. Now, if that's the case,  that I believe Paul is saying,  as I read this entire chapter,  and we talked about this somewhat last week as well. Here's what I think Paul is saying. Paul is saying, I believe so much in the brutality of life. I do not have rose-colored glasses.

I don't have a kind of mind-over-matter idea about this. I would never say, oh, you know, things aren't so bad  if you just learned to look at it this way. I so believe in the brutality of life,  the inevitable brutality of life,  that unless I knew there was glory coming to me,  I would not be able to lead a meaningful life  in the midst of all this suffering. Paul is saying, only glory makes it possible  to realistically face how bad life is  and live a meaningful life in the midst of it,  even a triumphant life in the midst of it,  only knowing what he says here,  and up in verse 18,  and over in 2 Corinthians 4,  where he says, I consider that the suffering of this present time  is not worthy to be compared  with the glory that will be revealed in us. I believe he says in 2 Corinthians 4,  the suffering of this present time is preparing  a weight of glory for us,  for as our outward nature waits away,  our inward is being renewed every day.

What is he talking about? There's two things. It's how we're going to close. The first of all, he's saying,  if you understand what Paul is saying here,  he's saying, that when we suffer in Christ,  holding on to Christ,  it makes us more real. I mean, it makes us more real.

Because the word glory,  animologically,  means weighty or solid. And actually, if you think about this,  we've been talking about this all through this series. If everybody loves their,  your career is important to everybody. And so if you have problems in your career,  it's going to shake you. But if you've completely built your life on your career,  if your whole identity is in your career,  then when something goes wrong with your career,  you're going to be shattered.

Just shattered. You know you left. No self left. And that's the reason that instead of putting our weight  on things that are always shifting around  and always shaking,  when you put your weight on the rock,  when you root yourself more firmly in the love of God  and what he says about you,  what he's done for you,  you become more solid,  you become more stable,  you become actually more real. That is to say,  you actually become something someone  who's going to last, no matter what.

Suffering when it gets you more deeply into God,  when it drives you more deeply into God  and into what he's done for you,  it makes you more real. Now the reason I know that Paul's right  is because the Velveteen Rabbit agrees with him. So for example,  the skin horse says to the Velveteen Rabbit,  when a child loves you for a long, long time,  then you become real. Does it hurt? Ask the Velveteen Rabbit?

Oh yes, to the skin horse. That's why it doesn't happen to those who break easily  or who have to be very carefully handled. By the time you are real,  most of your hair has been loved off  and your eyes drop out,  and you get really loose in the joints,  and you look awfully shabby. But once you are real,  you can't be ugly,  except to the people who don't understand. And you know that John Newton hymn  that goes where God is speaking to us basically,  and the John Newton hymn where God says,  these inward trials,  these inward trials I employ  from pride and self to set thee free  and break thy schemes of earthly joy  that thou mayst find thine all in me.

See, first of all,  suffering is actually making him more glorious now. Your inward person is being renewed day by day. Glory is preparing a weight of glory now,  but not only that,  the future glory overwhelms. Overwhelms. As we think about it, Paul says,  I reckon that the suffering in his present time  is not worthy to be compared with the glory  that should be revealed to us.

The future glory overwhelms  and puts perspective  and enables us to face what we've gotten in front of us. That's the reason why St. Teresa of Avala was able to say,  the first kiss from Jesus,  the first second of glory,  is going to make all the suffering you've ever experienced,  seem like one night in a bad hotel. That's the reason why Dostoevsky is going to be able to say,  I believe that suffering will be healed and made up for it,  that in the world's finale,  at the moment of eternal harmony,  something so precious will come to pass,  that it will suffice for all hearts  for the comforting of all resentments,  for the atonement of all the crimes of humanity,  of all the blood that they've shed,  that it will make it not just possible to forgive,  but to justify everything that's happened. That's awfully radical,  but something like that is what Paul's talking about.

Now, let me draw it all together. Do you understand that this glory is already making you,  pardon me, the suffering can already be making you glorious  and someday we'll be overshadowed by the glory  that is to be revealed? There's a metaphor that kind of a story  that CS Lewis gives us that draws all of this together,  and I'm just going to read it to you,  and not going to comment on it. There's a place where Flenery O'Connor was once asked,  could you tell us the meaning of your story? Could you just put it in one line, one sentence,  and she said,  if I could put it in one line or sentence,  I wouldn't have had to write the story.

And I have to say the same thing about this. Don't ask me what it means. It means more than I can tell you. It's about a ghost from hell,  not very real, you know. Who comes to the Oscars of Heaven,  this is a fiction, by the way,  and is looking longingly toward Heaven,  and an angel comes down to try to meet him,  but he's got a little red lizard on his shoulder,  and the lizard doesn't want to go,  so that ghost turns around very sadly to leave.

And the angel calls and says,  hey, why are you leaving so soon? And the ghost says, well,  this little fella here doesn't really want to go in that direction  so I can't. And the angel says,  would you like me to make it quiet? And the ghost says, well, it would be a relief. Then I will kill him, said the angel.

Oh, you didn't say anything about killing it. It's the only way, said the angel. May I kill it? Well, let's discuss that. There is no time.

May I kill it? Oh, look, it's gone to sleep. I'm sure it won't be any trouble anymore. Yes, it will. May I kill it?

Well, I think the gradual process is always better than,  no, the gradual process is of no use at all. May I kill it? Get back! You're hurting me. You didn't tell me it would hurt me.

I never said it wouldn't hurt you. I said it wouldn't kill you. May I kill it? Look, let me run back by tonight's bus  and get an opinion from my own doctor,  come to you the first moment I can. This moment contains all moments.

May I kill it? And then the lizard began chattering to the ghost,  so loud that everyone could hear what it was saying. He can do it. He can kill me. And then what would you do without me?

Oh, I admit, I've sometimes gone too far in the past,  but I promise I won't do it again. I'll be very good. May I kill it? Said the angel. Oh, do it.

Do it. Get it over with, cry the ghost. But God helped me. God helped me. Then the angel grabbed hold of the lizard  and broke its neck and threw it down  and the ghost screams and two amazing things happen.

First of all, the ghost stops being ghostly  and becomes radiant and gorgeous and bright and real  and a human being, a man. But the body of the red lizard, instead of disappearing,  it grows into a beautiful, powerful white horse. And the text goes on,  when the new-made man arose,  I thought his face shone with tears,  but it may have been only the liquid love  and brightness which flowed from him. Enjoy his haste. The man leaped upon the horse's back.

They were off like a shooting star on the green plane  and were soon to the mountains. Still like a star,  I saw them winding up,  scaling what seemed impossible steps quicker every moment  until the brow of the landscape,  so high that I strained my neck to see them,  they vanished,  bright themselves into the rose brightness  of that everlasting morning. Our slight momentary affliction  is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory  beyond all comparison. I am persuaded that neither death,  nor life, nor angels,  nor principalities,  nor powers, nor things present,  nor anything to come,  nor height, nor depth,  nor anything in all creation  is able to separate us from the love of God,  which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Let's pray.

Father, our bad things will turn out for good. Our most truly good things can never be taken from us  and our best things are yet to come. The realities that Christmas points to  become effective in our lives through these truths,  let these truths have their way with us,  make us real,  give us the ability to live meaningful lives,  even joyous lives,  in the midst of our grief and suffering. We thank you that it's possible through Jesus. It's in His name that we ask it.

Amen.

### 中文翻译

### 引言：对改变的渴望

你是否渴望在生活中看到真正的改变，在你的习惯、关系、内心中？今天，Tim Keller 探讨了基督徒生活中持久改变的实际发生方式，以及为什么福音提供了一种与其他任何东西截然不同的转变过程。

今晚的经文是罗马书 8 章 28 到 39 节：

> “我们晓得万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处，就是按祂旨意被召的人。因为祂预先所知道的人，就预先定下效法祂儿子的模样，使祂儿子在许多弟兄中作长子。预先所定下的人又召他们来，所召来的人又称他们为义，所称为义的人又叫他们得荣耀。”

**既是这样，还有什么说的呢？神若帮助我们，谁能敌挡我们呢？** 神既不爱惜自己的儿子为我们众人舍了，岂不也把万物和祂一同白白地赐给我们吗？

### 喜乐的三个基础

圣诞节是关于喜乐的。我们唱着“普世欢腾”。有没有注意到圣诞节我们唱这些快乐的绅士，没有什么能让他们沮丧？这真是令人惊奇。

我们上周也说过，我们正在通过罗马书 6、7 和 8 章，在这个系列中，我们来到我们正在看的段落或部分的结尾，即罗马书 8 章的结尾。

### 我们的坏事将变为好事

首先，我们的坏事将变为好事。想想圣诞节。耶稣出生在贫穷中。祂出生在危险中。你知道，祂的家人必须逃往埃及以躲避屠杀。客店里没有祂的地方。

但从耶稣的贫穷中产生了最大的属灵财富。从耶稣的软弱中产生了最不可思议的力量和能力。从耶稣的孤立和拒绝中，带来了人们在最深的爱和团结中团结在一起。

> “万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处。”

### 我们最真实的好事永远不会被夺走

其次，我们最真实的好事永远不会被夺走。现在这是圣诞节向我们展示的第二件事。为什么？

好吧，如果有什么，圣诞节向我们展示了神救恩的激进恩典。人类宗教的轨迹是我去找神。我必须通过道德努力和意识的转变等来提升。我必须向神提升。

### 我们最好的事情尚未到来

现在，第三件事实际上我们在第 30 节中看到。如果你通过 28、29 和 30 节，我们看到，正如我们已经看到的，祂预先爱我们。祂把祂的爱放在我们身上。祂召唤我们。祂称我们为义，给我们正确的关系。然后祂荣耀我们。

不，实际上这不是它所说的。这都是过去时。这不是我们会说的方式。你看到保罗在说什么吗？评论家们实际上几个世纪以来一直注意到这一点。这实际上非常引人注目。

**我们这至暂至轻的苦楚，要为我们成就极重无比永远的荣耀。**

让我们祷告。

父啊，我们的坏事将变为好事。我们最真实的好事永远不会被夺走，我们最好的事情尚未到来。圣诞节指向的现实通过这些真理在我们的生活中生效，让这些真理在我们身上发挥作用，使我们真实，给予我们在悲伤和痛苦中过有意义生活，甚至是快乐生活的能力。我们感谢您通过耶稣使这一切成为可能。我们奉祂的名求。阿门。

## Chinese Transcript / 中文

今天，提姆·凯勒要探讨的是：在一个基督徒的生命里，真正持久的改变究竟是怎样发生的？以及，为什么福音所提供的更新之路，和世上所有其他“改变方法”都截然不同。今晚经文出自罗马书第 8 章 28–39 节：

“我们晓得，万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处，就是按他旨意被召的人。因为他预先所知道的人，就预先定下效法他儿子的模样，使他儿子在许多弟兄中作长子。预先所定下的人，又召他们来；所召来的人，又称他们为义；所称为义的人，又叫他们得荣耀。”

“既是这样，还有什么说的呢？神若帮助我们，谁能抵挡我们呢？神既不爱惜自己的儿子，为我们众人舍了，岂不也把万物和他一同白白地赐给我们吗？谁能控告神所拣选的人呢？有神称他们为义了。谁能定他们的罪呢？有基督耶稣已经死了，而且从死里复活，如今在神的右边，也替我们祈求。”

“谁能使我们与基督的爱隔绝呢？难道是患难吗？是困苦吗？是逼迫吗？是饥饿吗？是赤身露体吗？是危险吗？是刀剑吗？如经上所记：‘我们为你的缘故终日被杀，人看我们如将宰的羊。’然而，靠着爱我们的主，在这一切的事上已经得胜有余了。”

“因为我深信无论是死，是生，是天使，是掌权的，是有能的，是现在的事，是将来的事，是高处的，是低处的，是别的受造之物，都不能叫我们与神的爱隔绝；这爱是在我们的主基督耶稣里的。”——这是上帝的话语。

圣诞节是关于喜乐的。我们唱《普世欢腾》，唱“喜乐”临到世界。你有没有注意到，在圣诞节我们还唱“上主忠仆心安宁，无惧忧愁与恐惧”？似乎什么都不能使他们惊惶，这太奇妙了。

上周我也提过：我们这段时间在讲罗马书 6、7、8 章，这一系列现在来到我们所看的这一大段的结尾——罗马书第 8 章的末了。正如我们上周所说，圣诞节的一个问题是：如果你正背着重担，如果你真正在和人生的问题搏斗，面对真实的苦难——而事实上，很多人正是如此——那么圣诞节其实会是很难熬的时刻，因为社会的信息是：“你应该开心，这可是圣诞节啊。”这反而会让人更难受。

所以，受苦的人在圣诞节很自然会问：圣诞节真正能给我什么喜乐的根基？我凭什么可以“喜乐”？圣诞到底给了我什么真实的喜乐根据？

答案是：如果圣诞是真的发生了——如果神真的在圣诞节里，在这可怜破碎世界的墙上凿开一个裂缝；如果他真的带着医治的大能闯入我们破碎的现实；如果他真的成为人；如果圣诞这件事是真的——那么，我想给你看三件事：三块坚固的“喜乐基石”，是圣诞带给我们的；无论在什么处境里都有，甚至在最深的哀痛中，你都可以感觉到这三样东西在托住你。

如果圣诞是真的。我最近又重新读一本书，这本书曾经是“必读书目”，甚至被称为“西方文明史上最有影响力的书之一”。书名叫《哲学的慰藉》，作者是波爱修斯。他既是哲学家又是政治家，却被关进监狱——是在被人诬告、等着行刑的时候写下这本书的。

他提出的问题是：如果这个世界几乎把一切可以让你快乐的东西都从你身上拿走了，你还有可能在这种处境下维持心里的平衡、盼望和喜乐吗？他的答案是：有可能。而且他是基督徒，他最后得出的结论，和我今晚要分享给你的这三件事，其实是同一件东西。

顺带说一句，这段经文极其壮丽、丰富，同时也触及很多人觉得棘手的问题，比如自由意志、预定等等。我会在圣诞节之后再回到这些话题上。但今晚呢，我想先给你一份“礼物”。嘿，听着，今晚我要给你一份礼物。你不用追问：“这礼物怎么来的？在哪里买的？过程如何？”——先享受就好。

如果圣诞节所说的是真的，而你也相信这是真的——如果你不信，你就拿不到这份礼物——那么有三件事、三块坚固的喜乐基石是属于你的：

一、我们的坏事，终究会变成好处。
二、我们真正美好的事物，永远不会被夺走。
三、我们最好的事，还在后头。

经文就是这么说的：我们的坏事会变成好处，我们最真实的好东西永远不会失去，而我们最好的东西还没有到来。若你真正知道、真正抓住这三件事，你就能面对人生的一切。

第一，我们的坏事会变成好处。想一想圣诞。耶稣在贫穷中出生，在危险中出生；他的家人必须逃到埃及躲避屠杀；客店里没有地方容纳他。但正是从耶稣的贫穷里，涌出最丰盛的属灵财富；从耶稣的软弱里，显出最惊人的能力和大能；从耶稣的孤立与被弃绝中，产生了一个被聚集起来、在最深的爱与合一里连在一起的群体。换句话说，是借着那些极可怕的事，通过那些极糟的处境，这些苦难发生之后，才带来极大的好处。

保罗在罗马书 8:28 说：“万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处。”所有的事——好的、坏的，琐碎的小事、重大的大事——“万事”都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处。

但我要先很快澄清：这节经文不是在讲什么肤浅、甜腻的人生观，不是那种“乌云背后总有一线银光”的鸡汤——好像这些坏事其实不是真坏事，只要你换一个角度看就好。不是这样的。

在拉撒路的坟墓前，耶稣的朋友拉撒路已经死了。他走到坟墓那里，周围的人都在哭。耶稣马上就要做的，就是保罗在罗马书 8:28 所说的事：他要从这所有的坏事当中带出好处，他要把荣耀和喜乐带进这个世界——若不是拉撒路死了，这些荣耀和喜乐本不会出现。他要从坏事里带出好处，要使这一切最终变成益处。

但你注意，耶稣不是一边走到坟前，一边偷偷笑着说：“等着瞧，我马上要做的事太酷了。”他没有在那儿窃笑；他没有说：“哦，我待会儿要让他从死里复活呢。”

相反，他是与哀哭的人同哭。经文说，他来到坟前的时候心里愤怒，甚至是“怒气冲天”。你几乎会被约翰福音 11 章里耶稣的形象逼着，想起威尔士诗人狄兰·托马斯那句著名的诗：“不要温顺地走入那良夜，要在光明消逝时怒吼。”这正是耶稣在那里的姿态——他在怒吼，怒斥死亡，这个把魂和身分开的东西；怒斥不公义，这个把种族和种族、人和人拆散的东西。凡是神所联络的，凡是把神所结合的拆开的，都是坏的，都是恶的。本身就恶，不是说“哦其实也有银色的衬里，只要你换个角度就好”。不是，它们就是坏的，就是可怕的。

耶稣憎恶这些东西，他在哭，他在对这些事发怒。但罗马书 8:28 说，神战胜这些真实而彻底的坏事的方式，是：在总体上，在“总和”上，神在掌控、在编织、在驾驭一切，使最终他战胜了坏，因为他要让所有这些坏事，在他手中互相效力，带来你生命里的好结果。

你也许会问：这怎么做到？

当然，我想至少有一种方式是我们相对容易理解的，还有一种方式，是我们永远也不可能完全明白，但你必须知道那种方式存在，否则你就无法承受人生的苦难。

比较容易理解的是经文里立刻说到的：28 节说神使万事互相效力叫我们得益处，29 节接着说，他对我们的整体计划，就是叫我们“效法他儿子的模样”。这部分是我们能稍微抓住一点的：你可能以为，自己最大的难题是“处境”。你以为：“我最大的难题是：如果我可以多赚一点钱，如果我能拿到那份工作，如果那扇门能为我打开……”你以为问题都在“环境”上。但环境并不能像性格缺陷那样，真正毁掉你的人生。

真正会毁掉你的，是你的品格——愚昧、骄傲、自私、不愿承认自己的罪和缺陷、刚硬的心，尤其是那种虚假的幻想，以为你可以离开神自己掌控人生。所有这些错谬、性格上的缺口，几乎无一例外，都需要“坏事”来将它们从我们身上击打出去。

几乎所有活过二、三十年的人——无意冒犯在座的年轻人——但对那些已经活过二、三十年甚至更久的人来说，我们身上都有一些经历，有伤痕，那些事情本身是坏的，到今天还会疼，可是那些经历给我们的洞见、品格、韧性，是我们用什么都不愿交换的。这只是经文所讲的一个小小的影子：各种各样的坏事会临到你，而神要借着这些事，使你越来越像他的儿子。离开这种“效法基督”，就没有真正的喜乐。

你可能会说：“好吧，就是这样吗？所有的坏事只是要把我变成一个更好的人而已吗？”当然不止。神让万事互相效力叫你得益处，还有另一种层面，是我们永远也不能看透的；但如果你要面对人生的苦难，你必须知道那层面真实存在：你必须知道，神正在使万事互相效力叫你得益处，而你根本不可能搞懂他到底是怎么做的。

对我来说，最典型、也最关键的例子，就是在十字架脚下。我只说我自己，不替你认罪，只替我自己认罪——如果那天下午我也站在十字架下，像大多数人那样，只知道大家都知道、也只知道大家都知道的那些事实：眼前这个人非常好，他大有能力，这个拥有巨大能力去行善的人，医治人、喂饱人，有着无限可能，却在 33 岁时生命被腰斩，这是一个悲剧，很明显神离弃了他，事实上他自己也喊出“神啊，你为什么离弃我？”

如果我只有这些事实，我一定会抬头看着十字架，说：“我看不出神怎么可能从这件事里带出什么好处。”然后我可能会回家，信心摇动，甚至失去信心，因为我根本想不到，在那里，神正在为人类做出历史上最大、也将是最大的一件美事——只因为那件事不符合我脑袋里的模式，不合我小小的类别，我就会说：“我看不出神在这里还能干什么好事。”

换句话说，如果你面对的是无限的神，那当然就有一大堆他允许某些事发生的理由，是你不可能想到的、不可能理解的。如果你不肯承认这一点，那其实是极大的傲慢。

如果在十字架脚下我会那样反应——我猜你可能也会——那么，当你觉得自己被离弃，当一切临到你身上，你完全看不出来有什么好理由解释这些事为什么要发生的时候，千万别再犯当年的错，别再犯同样的错误。

我们的坏事终究会变成好处——这是第一件必须抓住的事，而圣诞正好向我们显明这点。

第二，我们最真实的好东西，永远不会被夺走。圣诞同样把这点显出来。为什么？因为如果说有什么事情最能展现神救恩的“极致白白恩典”，那就是圣诞了。

人类所有宗教的走向几乎都一样：我要向上爬；我要借着道德努力，借着意识的某种转化，一步步向神攀升，然后神就会祝福我；只要我活得够好，他就会救我。而福音的轨迹则完全相反，是从神向下到人——在圣诞节，神仿佛在说：“你永远到不了我这里，我必须下来找你。你永远不可能靠自己够得着我。”

所以他跨越了神与人之间整个鸿沟，走完全程，来到我们中间。当耶稣来的时候，他是以贫穷、软弱的样式来到的。威廉·比林斯那首伟大的圣诞诗歌里有句歌词：“莫向王宫宫廷去，莫拉贵帘似寻觅；惟在马槽勤查找，你的上主卧草席。”——“神躺在稻草上”。

为什么神不是以一位统帅、率领军队的姿态来到？为什么他不是以高坐宝座的君王样式来到？为什么他是贫穷、软弱地来？我要告诉你：他不是作为“强者的强者”来到，不是“只给强者的神”。他绝不是那个“只帮助自助者的神”。绝对不是。相反，他是为那些软弱的人而来，为那些做不了本该做的事的人而来。

所以他来是要受苦，是要受死，是要担当我们罪的刑罚；他来是要把爱，把救恩，把所有这些美好的祝福，白白赐给我们——完全不基于我们身上任何条件。这是超越条件、超过一切度量的爱，是“爱到没有量度的爱”。

这正是这段经文要说的。诗篇可以深刻塑造我们如何来到神面前。连耶稣在面对一切处境甚至死亡时，都倚靠诗篇。提姆和凯西·凯勒合著的 365 天灵修《耶稣的诗歌：诗篇灵修》，每天带你读诗篇，给你新的圣经洞见。如果你没有固定的灵修习惯，这本书会是极好的起点；如果你已经有读经祷告的时间，那么借着诗篇来祷告，可以帮助你把最深的情绪和问题带到神面前，与他建立一个新的亲密层次。我们愿意把这本灵修书作为礼物，送给那些愿意奉献支持“福音与生命”事工的人，你可以在 gospelandlife.com/give 索取。

再回到经文。比如这里说，神“预先知道”我们。你觉得这是什么意思？你可能会说，“预先知道”就是“预先看见”。不是。你要记住，在圣经里，“知道”是一个很强的关系性词汇。“知道关于某事”是认知层面的，但“认识”是经历性的；你可以“知道关于某个人”的情报，却仍然不“认识他”。

因此，当经文说“神预先知道我们”，真正要表达的不是“神预先看见我们”，而是“神预先爱我们”——他在我们还没有向他任何行动之前，就先把爱摆在我们身上。这就是他那种毫无条件、主动出击的爱。

最好的例子就是浪子回头。你看那个父亲：浪子回来时，父亲有坐在门廊上翘着脚，冷冷地说：“你最好有个好解释”？还是说：“如果他真心认罪，我才会给他拥抱”？都没有。父亲是跑过去，抱住他，亲他、扑向他，用爱淹没他，让他更容易、更自由地认罪悔改。是神的爱激发了我们的爱，而不是我们的爱引出神的爱。神的爱先行，人的爱才被唤醒——这就是这种爱有多么激进、多么没有条件。

你也许会说：“那自由意志怎么办？”我说过会回来谈这点。我的建议是：先收下礼物，别急着辩论。礼物是什么呢？就是：神不只是老板，他是父亲。老板可以欣赏一个员工，但如果那个员工一次又一次犯错，再好说话的老板心里也会开始想：“我要怎么把他弄走？”

可当孩子一次又一次犯错时，父母的反应却相反：这只会让父母对孩子更加挂心，更加投入。爱被聚焦、被强化。孩子越是搞砸，父母的爱越是朝孩子爆发。

这意味着什么？你真正拥有的那些伟大恩赐——你的称义，你与神和好的身份，你被收纳进神家中的收养，你与他的关系——这些东西不会被夺走。经文最后说：“无论在受造之物中有什么，都不能叫我们与神的爱隔绝。”这就是说：那位宇宙至高的主宰，对他来说，银河不过像秤上的微尘，他却以父母那种毫无条件、炽烈的爱爱着你。

这就是第二点，圣诞所显明的：你的坏事终究会变成好处，你真正好的东西永远不会被夺走，而你最好的事还在前面。

第三点，我们最好的事还在后头。第 30 节这样说：在 28、29、30 节里，我们看到——刚才已经提过——他预先爱我们，把爱加在我们身上；他呼召我们；他称我们为义，使我们与他有对的关系；然后，他又叫我们得荣耀。等等，经文不是这样说的——仔细看，它都是用过去式说的。

而这不是我们平时表达的方式。如果我们来写，面对信徒，我们会说：他曾经把爱加给你，他呼召了你，他称你为义，有一天他还要叫你得荣耀。但保罗不是这么说的：他都用过去式说：“他已经叫你得荣耀了。”

这是什么意思？首先，这说明我们将来的荣耀，因为基督已经成就的缘故，已经确定到一个地步，可以用过去式来讲了——是如此确定。你说：“怎么可能这么确定？”那首《稳固根基》的诗歌里，神对我们说：“那魂若倚靠我主得安息，不会不曾遭试炼或攻击；纵然地狱合力来将他震动，我仍不离不弃，永远不放松。”——请留意那句“永不离弃”。

神怎么可能“永远不离弃我们”？因为在十字架上，耶稣已经说出了那句：“你为什么离弃我？”——耶稣是代替我们被离弃，好叫我们永远不被离弃。换一种说法：耶稣失去了荣耀——腓立比书 2 章说，他倒空自己；以赛亚书 53 章说，他“无佳形美容使我们羡慕他”。他完全失去了荣耀，他变得卑微、渺小、枯槁，变得不被重视，毫不起眼——他失去了一切荣耀，好叫我们的荣耀可以确定到一个地步，保罗可以用过去式来讲。

如果是这样，我认为保罗在这一章里——上周我们也稍微提过——是在说：我对人生的残酷有清醒的认识，我绝不是戴着玫瑰色眼镜看世界，也不是搞“意念战胜现实”的那一套。我绝不会说：“事情其实没那么糟，只要你学会换个角度看。”不，我太清楚人生的残酷是必然的；除非我知道将来有荣耀要临到我，否则我根本不可能在这苦难中过一个有意义的生活。

保罗是在说：只有荣耀，使我们能够诚实地面对生命有多糟糕，却仍能在当中活出一个有意义甚至得胜的人生。只有当你知道他在这里、在 18 节那里、在哥林多后书 4 章那里所说的：“我想，现在的苦楚若比起将来要显于我们的荣耀，就不足介意。”“我们这至暂至轻的苦楚，要为我们成就极重无比、永远的荣耀；原来我们不是顾念所见的，乃是顾念所不见的；因为所见的是暂时的，所不见的是永远的。”

他在讲什么？有两个层面，我也借此来作结。第一，当我们在基督里受苦，仍紧紧抓住基督的时候，这苦难会让我们变得更真实——“更有分量”。“荣耀”这个字在原文里，字面含义就是“重量”“厚重”“坚实”。你想想，我们整个系列都在说：每个人都会看重自己的事业，所以事业出问题，会让你摇晃。但如果你完全把自己建在事业上，把整个身份都押在事业上，那么事业一出问题，你就会被摧毁、粉碎——你会觉得自己不再是一个人，好像整个“自我”都没了。

这正是为什么，我们不能把重量压在那些总在变动、总在震动的东西上，而要把重量压在磐石上，把自己更深地扎根在神的爱里和他对你的评价、他为你所做的事上。这样，你就会变得更坚固、更稳定、更真实——成为一个真正会存留下来的人。苦难若把你更深地推向神，使你更紧抓住他为你所做的一切，它就正在使你变得更加“有荣耀”、更加真实。

我之所以知道保罗说的是对的，是因为《绒布小兔子》（The Velveteen Rabbit）也这样说。那里面，皮马（Skin Horse）对绒布兔说：“当一个孩子长长久久地爱着你，你就会变成‘真实’。”绒布兔问：“那会痛吗？”皮马说：“哦，会的，很痛。所以这种事不会发生在那些容易坏、又要小心保养的玩具身上。当你变成真实的时候，你身上的毛大半被爱得掉光了，眼睛也会掉出来，关节松松垮垮，看起来很破旧。但当你变成真实以后，就再也不会丑，除非在那些不懂的人眼里。”

约翰·牛顿有一首诗歌，里面神对我们说：“这些内在的试炼，是我所使用，要叫你从骄傲与自恃中得释放，要拆毁你一切属地的喜乐计划，使你可以在我里面找到全部的满足。”——你看，苦难现在就正在使你更有荣耀：你里面的人一天一天被更新，荣耀正在为你预备更大的荣耀；同时，将来的荣耀又会压倒现在的一切，让我们能面对人生所摆在面前的一切。

这就是为什么阿维拉的德兰能说：“从耶稣那里的第一个亲吻，天上荣耀的第一秒，就会让你一生所有的苦难，看起来不过是在一家差旅馆里睡了一晚。”这也是为什么陀思妥耶夫斯基能说：“我相信，一切苦难都会被医治、被补还；在世界的终局、永恒和谐的那一刻，会有某种宝贵的事发生，它将足以安慰一切心灵，平息一切怨恨，为人类所有的罪行、所有流的血作出偿还，使我们不仅可以宽恕一切发生过的事，甚至可以证明这一切是值得的。”这话非常激进，但保罗在这里讲的，大致就是这样的意思。

最后，让我把这些合在一起。你是否看见：这荣耀已经在现在的苦难中，使你变得更有荣耀；而将来要显出的荣耀，又会完全遮盖你现在所受的一切？C.S. 路易斯有一个比喻——其实是一个故事——把这一切都串在一起，我念给你听，不再多解释。弗兰纳里·奥康纳有一次被问到：“你能不能用一句话把你小说的意思讲出来？”她回答说：“如果我能用一句话讲出来，我就不需要写整本小说了。”我对这个故事也只能说一样的话：别问我这一切到底是什么意思，它表达的意思远远超过我能说的。

故事讲的是一个从地狱来的“鬼魂”，有点虚幻、不太真实，他来到了天国边界的草地——当然，这是文学虚构——他眺望着天堂，心里向往，这时有一位天使下来看他。但他的肩上趴着一只小红蜥蜴，蜥蜴不想往天堂那边去，于是这鬼魂就很难过地转身准备离开。天使叫住他说：“嘿，你为什么这么快就走？”鬼魂回答：“因为这小家伙不太想往那边走，所以我也没办法。”天使说：“你要我让它安静吗？”鬼魂说：“那倒是松一口气。”天使说：“那我就杀了它吧。”

鬼魂说：“你刚刚没说要杀它啊。”天使说：“这是唯一的办法。我可以杀掉它吗？”鬼魂说：“呃……我们来讨论一下这件事吧。”天使说：“来不及讨论了，我现在就要问：我可以杀掉它吗？”鬼魂又说：“你看，它睡着了，我相信它不会再造成什么麻烦了。”天使说：“不，它会的。我可以杀掉它吗？”鬼魂喝斥说：“退开，你弄疼我了！你没告诉我会疼啊。”天使说：“我从没说过不会疼，我只说不会要你的命。我可以杀掉它吗？”鬼魂说：“让我先坐今夜最后一班车回去，听听我的医生怎么说，等我方便就来找你。”天使说：“这一刻就包含了你所有的时刻。我可以杀掉它吗？”

这时小蜥蜴开始对鬼魂大声嚷嚷，大到所有人都听得见：“他真能做到的，他会杀了我！那你没有我，要怎么办？好吧，我承认以前有时候是有点过分，但我保证以后不会了，我会很乖的……”天使问：“我可以杀掉它吗？”鬼魂终于喊：“动手吧，动手吧，快点结束这一切。但愿神帮助我。”天使抓住蜥蜴，扭断它的脖子，把它丢到地上——鬼魂尖叫起来，同时两件奇妙的事发生了：第一，鬼魂不再虚幻，而是变得光辉灿烂、明亮坚实，变成一个真实的人；第二，那只红蜥蜴的尸体并没有消失，反而变成了一匹美丽强壮的白马。

接着故事继续说：新造的人站起来，我以为他的脸上带着泪光，但那也许只是从他里面涌出来的爱的光辉。他欢欣地纵身一跃，骑上那匹马，如流星般掠过绿地，一路向那山岭奔去；我看到他们沿着似乎不可能翻越的绝壁向上，一刻比一刻快，直到来到地平线边缘高处，我几乎仰断了脖子才勉强看见他们，直到他们消失——他们自己已然如星辰一般，融入那永恒清晨的玫瑰色光辉里。

“我们这至暂至轻的苦楚，要为我们成就极重无比、永远的荣耀。”——“我深信，无论是死，是生，是天使，是掌权的，是有能的，是现在的事，是将来的事，是高处的，是低处的，是别的受造之物，都不能叫我们与神的爱隔绝；这爱是在我们的主基督耶稣里的。”

我们来祷告：

父啊，我们的坏事终究会变成好处；我们最真实的好东西永远不会被夺走；我们最好的事还在后头。圣诞所指向的这些真实，求你借着这些真理在我们心里动工，使这些真理在我们里面掌权，使我们变得真实，使我们在哀痛和苦难中仍能活出有意义、甚至喜乐的生命。我们感谢你，这一切在耶稣里都成为可能。我们奉他的名祷告，阿们。

今天，提姆·凯勒要探讨的是：在一个基督徒的生命里，真正持久的改变究竟是怎样发生的？以及，为什么福音所提供的更新之路，和世上所有其他“改变方法”都截然不同。今晚经文出自罗马书第 8 章 28–39 节：“我们晓得，万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处，就是按他旨意被召的人。因为他预先所知道的人，就预先定下效法他儿子的模样，使他儿子在许多弟兄中作长子。预先所定下的人，又召他们来；所召来的人，又称他们为义；所称为义的人，又叫他们得荣耀。”

“既是这样，还有什么说的呢？神若帮助我们，谁能抵挡我们呢？神既不爱惜自己的儿子，为我们众人舍了，岂不也把万物和他一同白白地赐给我们吗？谁能控告神所拣选的人呢？有神称他们为义了。谁能定他们的罪呢？有基督耶稣已经死了，而且从死里复活，如今在神的右边，也替我们祈求。”

“谁能使我们与基督的爱隔绝呢？难道是患难吗？是困苦吗？是逼迫吗？是饥饿吗？是赤身露体吗？是危险吗？是刀剑吗？如经上所记：‘我们为你的缘故终日被杀，人看我们如将宰的羊。’然而，靠着爱我们的主，在这一切的事上已经得胜有余了。”

“因为我深信无论是死，是生，是天使，是掌权的，是有能的，是现在的事，是将来的事，是高处的，是低处的，是别的受造之物，都不能叫我们与神的爱隔绝；这爱是在我们的主基督耶稣里的。”——这是上帝的话语。

圣诞节是关于喜乐的。我们唱《普世欢腾》，唱喜乐临到世界。你有没有注意到，在圣诞节我们还唱“愿上帝赐你喜乐平安，莫要忧伤和惊惶”？好像什么都不能使他们惊惧，这太奇妙了。

上周我们也提到：我们一直在讲罗马书 6、7、8 章，这个系列现在来到我们所看的这一大段的末尾——罗马书第 8 章的结尾。正如我们上周说的，圣诞节的一个问题是：如果你正背着重担，如果你真的在与人生的难题搏斗——而事实上，很多人正是如此——那么圣诞节反而会很难熬，因为社会传递的信息是：“你应该开心，这是圣诞节啊。”这反而会让人更难受。

许多人正经历着真实的人生难题、真实的苦难，而圣诞节对他们来说尤为艰难，因为整个世界都在传递一个讯息：你此刻应该很快乐——现在是圣诞节啊。但这只会让痛苦的人觉得更糟。受苦的人在圣诞节，非常合理地会问：圣诞到底凭什么给我带来喜乐？

为什么我在这样的处境中，还应该有喜乐？圣诞到底能真正给我什么样的喜乐根基？如果圣诞真的发生过，如果上帝真的在圣诞节打开了这个世界怜悯松动的墙缝，如果祂真在我们破碎的现实中闯入，带着医治的大能，如果祂真成了人——如果圣诞是真的——我想给你看三件事，三块坚实的喜乐根基，是圣诞所赐、能在任何处境之下托住你的；即便在最深的哀伤中，这三件事仍然能托住你。若圣诞真的发生了——

最近我重新读一本曾经是必读经典的书，它被称为西方文明史上最有影响力的书之一，叫《哲学的慰藉》，作者是波伊提乌斯。波伊提乌斯既是哲学家又是政治家，却被关进监狱，他就是在狱中写下这本书——当时他是被罗织罪名、等候处决的人。他在书里提出的问题是：如果这个世界几乎把你一切可喜乐的东西都夺走了，你还有没有可能在这一切面前，仍旧保持心灵的平衡、盼望和喜乐？他的结论是：有可能。而他是一位基督徒，他给出的其实正是我今晚要和你分享的这三件事。

顺带一提，这段经文本身极其奇妙，范围很大，也牵涉许多人觉得棘手的问题，比如自由意志、预定等等。那些内容圣诞之后我会再回到。但今晚，我想先给你一份礼物。嘿，听着，今晚我给你一份礼物。你不需要一边拆礼物，一边追问：你怎么得到的？在哪里买的？你就先享受吧。

如果圣诞是真的，如果你也相信圣诞所述的那一切真的发生过，因为如果你不信，你就得不到这份礼物。若你相信圣诞是真的，那么有三件事——三块坚实的喜乐根基：

我们的坏事，终将被翻转成好处；
我们真正的好东西，永远不会被夺走；
我们最好的事，还在前头等着我们。

经文就是这样告诉我们的：我们的坏事会变成好事；我们最真实的好东西永不能被夺去；而我们最好的事还未来到。如果你知道这些，如果你抓住这些，你就能面对人生的一切。

第一，坏事会变成好处。想一想圣诞：耶稣出生在贫穷中，出生在危险之中。祂的家人不得不逃往埃及，逃避屠杀；客店里没有祂的地方。可是在耶稣的贫穷之中，却生出最丰富的属灵财富；在耶稣的软弱之中，却彰显出最不可思议的能力与大能；在耶稣的孤立与被弃之中，却成就了一个新群体，被聚集在一起，在最深的爱与合一里彼此联结。换句话说，正是借着那些极其可怕的事，通过那些可怕的事，因为那些可怕的事发生了，才带来极大的好处。

保罗在罗马书8章28节说：万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处。所有的事——坏的、好的，小的、不起眼的，乃至重大又惊人的——“万事”都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处。现在我得立刻先说明，这并不是一种肤浅、甜腻的人生观，好像在说：每片乌云背后都有银边——这些坏事其实不是真的坏，只要你学会换个角度看就好。不，绝不是这样。

在拉撒路的坟前，耶稣的朋友拉撒路死了，祂来到坟墓那里，周围的人都在哭泣。此刻耶稣就要做的，正是保罗在罗马书8章28节所说的——祂要从这一切坏事当中带出好处，要把原本不会有的荣耀与喜乐带到世界上来；若非拉撒路死了，那样的荣耀与喜乐就不会出现。祂要从坏事中带出好事，要使这些事互相效力，得着美好的结局。然而你注意，祂并不是站在坟墓前轻声笑着。

耶稣不是走到坟墓前说：等你们看看我要做什么……祂没有在那儿暗自发笑，说：哦，我要叫他从死里复活了。相反，祂与哀哭的人一同哭泣。经文告诉我们，祂在坟前愤怒、激动，像是大声咆哮一般。约翰福音第11章对耶稣在坟前的描写，几乎让你不得不想到威尔士大诗人狄兰·托马斯那句名言：“不要温顺地走入那良夜，要怒吼怒吼，抗拒光明的熄灭。”这正是耶稣在那里的姿态——祂在向死亡怒吼。

死亡把灵魂与身体分开；不义使种族与种族、人和人彼此隔绝；凡是上帝原本联结在一起的，却被拆散的事物——这一切都是坏的，是邪恶本身。它们不是所谓“有银边的乌云”，也不是“只要换个角度看就不算坏”，不，它们本身就是坏的，是极其可怕的。耶稣憎恶它们，祂为此流泪，为此愤怒。

但罗马书8章28节说，上帝战胜这些真实而彻底的恶的方式，是在“万事”的总和上、整体上，祂在其上执掌王权、加以塑造、驾驭一切，使到头来，祂借着万事的共同运作，带着主权地把坏事变为好处，在你生命里带出美好的结果。你可能会问：这是怎么做到的？

当然，我认为上帝这样行事，有一种方式相对容易理解，还有另一种方式则完全超出我们理解的范围。比较容易理解的一种方式，就写在本段经文里。28节说，祂叫万事互相效力，得着好处；29节又说，祂对我们的计划，是要我们效法祂儿子的模样。

这部分我们是可以理解的，也就是说：你也许以为自己最大的问题是环境，以为自己真正的难题是：如果我能多赚点钱，如果我能找到那份工作，如果这扇门能打开——你就以为问题主要在环境里。但环境不能毁掉你的人生，至少不像性格的缺陷那样能毁掉你。真正能毁掉你的，是你的品格。真正危险的是愚妄、骄傲、

自私，对自己罪与缺点的否认，刚硬的心，尤其是那种虚妄的幻想——以为自己真的可以在没有上帝的情况下掌控人生。所有这些错误、这些性格中的扭曲，几乎总是需要借着一些“坏”的事件来被击碎、被除去。

我们当中凡是活过二三十年的人——无意冒犯任何人——凡是活过二三十年，甚至更久的人，回头看都会发现：在我们身上发生过一些事，留下了伤痕，它们确实是坏的，而且直到今天仍会带来疼痛。然而，我们从中得来的洞见、品格与力量，却又是我们绝不愿意用任何东西来交换的。这只不过是经文所说之事的一个小小暗示：各样坏事必然会临到你，而上帝却要藉着这些事，使你更像祂的儿子。若没有这种被塑造成儿子样式的过程，就不可能有真正在的喜乐。

于是你会说：好吧，那这就说尽了吗？意思是所有的坏事，只是为了把我塑造成一个更好的人吗？不，绝不止于此。显然，还有另一层上帝使万事互相效力得益处的方式，是我们永远无法理解的。而如果你想在现实的人生苦难中站立得住，你就必须知道：上帝正在使万事互相效力得益处，而你不可能完全明白祂怎样做。

对我来说，直到今天，看得最清楚的例子仍然是十字架。我只能先替自己认罪，不替你认——如果我在那阴沉的午后站在十字架脚下，像许多人一样，只知道当时众人所知的一切，别无更多：那是一个极好的人，一个充满能力的人，一个拥有巨大行善能力的人。他医治病人，喂饱饥饿的人，他满有潜力。却在三十三岁的年纪就被截断生命，含冤而死。很明显，上帝似乎离弃了他，他自己也说，上帝离弃了他。

在只有这些信息的前提下，如果我站在那里仰望那十字架，我一定会说：我看不出上帝能从这一切里面带出什么好处。然后，我很可能带着摇摇欲坠、甚至失去的信心回家。

也许还会失去，或者至少信心会被严重动摇。因为我完全看不见上帝怎么可能借着这件事带来极大的好处——而事实上，那正是上帝为人类所做、并将要做的一切中最伟大的一件事。但那时，在我那狭小的大脑模式和有限的分类体系里，这一切都完全对不上号。所以我会说：我看不出上帝到底在做什么。

换句话说，如果你所面对的是一位无限的上帝，那么祂允许某些事发生，当然可能有一些理由是你根本无法考虑、无法理解的；认为自己一定能看透所有理由，这才是真正的狂妄。如果在十字架脚下，我会这样反应——我猜，多半你也会如此——那么，当你在自己的人生中觉得被撇下、觉得所有事情都朝你扑来、觉得完全看不见任何合理的好理由时，你千万不要再犯同样的错误。

不要再犯同样的错误。我们的坏事终将被翻转成好处——这是必须牢牢记住的一件大事，而圣诞正是向我们显明了这一点。

其次，我们最真实的好东西永远不会被夺去。这是圣诞向我们显明的第二件事。为什么？因为如果说有什么是圣诞最清楚表明的，那就是上帝救恩的彻底恩典性。

人类宗教的走向，大多是“我要往上爬到上帝那里去”：我必须借着道德努力、借着意识的提升或某种内在修炼向上攀登；等我爬到一定程度，上帝就会赐福我。如果我活得足够好，那么祂就会祝福我、拯救我。而福音的方向正好相反——是从上往下、从神到人。

你看，在圣诞事件中，上帝基本是在说：你们永远到不了我这里来，我必须下到你们那里去；你们根本不可能自己爬上来。因此，祂跨越了神与人之间整个鸿沟，祂一路走下来，一直走到我们中间。而当耶稣来到世上，祂是以贫穷、软弱的样式来临的。

在赞美诗人威廉·比林斯的一首伟大圣诗里，有这样一句话：不要在宫廷和王宫中搜寻，也不要拉开皇家帷幕；要去寻找马槽，在那里你会看见你的上帝躺卧在草料上——上帝就这样伸展开来，躺卧在草上。你想想：为什么上帝不以统帅军队的将军身份来到？为什么不坐在宝座上的君王身份来到？

却偏偏以贫穷、软弱的样式降生？我来告诉你为什么。

祂不是作为“强者的强者”来寻找那些本来就很强的人；祂不是那种“自助者天助之”的上帝，绝不是这样。祂来是为了那些软弱的人，为了那些根本做不到自己该做之事的人。所以祂来受苦、来受死，来担当我们罪的刑罚。因此，祂来是要赐给我们爱和一切救恩的好处，而这些都是无条件的——因为它们不是建立在我们身上的任何条件之上。那是一种超越一切条件的爱，是一种超越一切程度的爱，这也是这段经文整篇要告诉我们的。

诗篇能深刻地塑造你亲近上帝的方式，连耶稣也在每一种处境中——包括死亡——都依靠诗篇来面对。在提姆与凯西·凯勒合著的《耶稣之歌》这本365天灵修书里，你会在每日经文中，跟随诗篇得到新鲜的圣经洞见。如果你还没有固定的灵修习惯，这本书是一个很好的开始；如果你已经有固定的读经祷告时间，那么透过诵读和祷读诗篇，就能帮助你把自己最深的情感与疑问带到神面前，经历与祂更深的新层次亲密。我们愿意把这本灵修书作为礼物送给你，感谢你为“福音与生命”（Gospel and Life）事工的奉献，帮助我们向更多人分享耶稣的爱。你可以在 gospelandlife.com/give 索取你的书，就是 gospelandlife.com/give。

那么，比方说，看那句经文说：祂“预先所知道的人”。你觉得这是什么意思？你可能会说：“预先知道”就是祂事先看见我们。不。要记着，圣经里的“认识”是个极其关系性的字。知道关于某件事，是认知层面的；“认识”某个人，则是经验层面的。你可以知道关于某人的许多事情，却仍然不真正“认识”他。因此，当经文说上帝“预先所知道”的时候，它真正要表达的不是“祂事先看见我们”，而是“祂先爱了我们”。

也就是说，在我们还没有向祂迈出任何一步之前，祂已经把爱放在我们身上——这就是祂的爱何等无条件、何等主动、何等“进攻性”的地方。若要一个完美的例子，就是浪子回头的故事。你看，那浪子回来了，父亲有没有站在门廊上，脚一跺一跺地说：“这下你可得好好解释解释”？父亲有没有说：“如果他先好好悔改，我才会爱他”？

不是的。父亲是跑向他，抱住他、亲吻他，猛力地把爱浇灌在他身上，反而使他更容易真诚悔改。我们的爱不是唤起上帝的爱；相反，是上帝的爱唤起我们的爱——这就是祂的爱何等激进、何等无条件。

你可能会说：那自由意志怎么办？——我说过我会回头谈这个问题。但不如你先现在就收下这份礼物吧。礼物是什么呢？就是：上帝不仅是“老板”，祂是父亲。

老板可以欣赏一个员工，但如果那个员工一再犯错，一错再错，即便是最友善的老板也会开始想：我该怎么把他辞掉？——怎样才能摆脱他？哪怕是最好的老板，当员工反复搞砸事情时，也会想：我得想办法把他处理掉。

可是当一个孩子一次又一次搞砸事情的时候，父母的反应却恰恰相反：这只会让父母更加迫切地关切这个孩子，只会让父母对孩子的爱变得更强烈、更集中。孩子越是出问题，父母的爱就越是向着他爆发。

这意味着什么？意味着你真正拥有的那些伟大祝福——你的称义（我们之前谈过，被神看为义）、你被收纳为儿女、你与神的关系——这些都不会被夺走。经文在结尾说，在受造之物中，无论里面的、外面的，没有什么能使我们与神的爱隔绝。这就意味着：那位宇宙的绝对主宰——对祂来说，银河系不过如同秤上的灰尘——竟然以父母那样无条件、强烈的爱来爱你。

这是第二件事，也是圣诞向我们显明的一件事：你的坏事终将被翻转成好处；你最真实的好东西永远不会被夺去；而你最好的事，还在前头。

第三件事，其实在30节里就看见了。如果你从28、29节读到30节，会看见我们已经提过：祂预先爱了我们，把爱放在我们身上；祂呼召我们；祂称我们为义，使我们与祂有对的关系；然后祂荣耀了我们——不对，经文并不是这样说的。它没有说“将荣耀我们”，而是全都用过去式。

这并不是我们平常说话的方式。我们通常会对基督徒说：祂已经把爱放在你身上，祂已经呼召你，祂已经赦免你，使你在祂面前被看为义；并且有一天，祂要荣耀你。可保罗不是这么说的；他却说：祂已经荣耀了你——过去式。

过去式？这是什么意思？保罗在说：我们的将来荣耀，因为基督已经成就的工作，是如此确定，以至于他可以这样说——它确定到这种地步。

当然不是。父亲是跑过去迎接他，抱住他、亲吻他，几乎是扑到他身上，把爱一股脑地浇灌在他身上，使他更容易悔改。我们的爱不是唤起上帝的爱；相反，是上帝的爱唤起我们的爱。这就是祂的爱何等激进、何等无条件。

你也许会说：那自由意志怎么办？——我说过会回头谈这个。但不如你先现在就接下这份礼物吧。礼物是什么呢？就是：上帝不只是老板，祂是父亲。

老板可以欣赏一个员工，可是如果那个员工一次又一次搞砸事情，即便是最好的老板，也会开始想：我要怎么把她/他辞掉？我要怎么摆脱这个人？哪怕是最友善的老板，当员工反复出错时，也会暗暗盘算：我得想办法让他离开。

可当一个孩子一错再错的时候，这只会让父母对孩子更加牵挂，更加深切地挂心。那会让父母的爱变得更强烈、更集中。孩子越是出状况，父母的爱就越是向着他爆发。

这意味着什么？意味着你所拥有的那一切真正伟大的祝福——你的称义（我们谈过，被神视为义人）、你被收养进神的家中、你与祂的关系——这些都不会被夺去。经文在结尾说：在整个受造界里，无论里面的、外面的，没有什么能使你与神的爱隔绝。这就意味着：那位宇宙的绝对主宰——对祂来说，银河只像秤上的细尘——竟以父母那样无条件、炽烈的爱来爱你。

这是第二件事。圣诞向我们显明：你的坏事终将被翻成好处；你最真实的好东西永不会被夺走；而你最好的事还在前头。

第三件事，其实可以在30节里看到。如果你从28节、29节一路读到30节，就会看到我们已经说过的：祂预先爱了我们，把爱放在我们身上；祂呼召我们；祂称我们为义，使我们与祂有对的关系；然后祂荣耀我们——不对，经文并不是这样说的。经文里的所有动词都是过去式。这并不是我们平常会用的表达方式。

你和我若是对基督徒说话，通常会这么讲：上帝已经把爱放在你身上，祂已经呼召你，已经称你为义，赦免你；而有一天，祂将要荣耀你。保罗却不是这么说，他说：祂已经荣耀了你——过去完成的事实。

过去式？他在说什么呢？首先，他在说：因为耶稣基督已经成就的工作，你将来的荣耀是如此确定，以至于他可以这样说——那荣耀是如此笃定。

你会问：怎么可能确定到这种程度？我们唱过那首诗歌《何等稳固根基》，里面有几句是上帝对我们说的话：

“那把重担卸在耶稣身上的灵魂，
我必不、也绝不把他交给仇敌；
那灵魂，即便全地狱一齐起来摇动他，
我也绝不、绝不、绝不撇弃他。”

这“绝不、绝不、绝不”正是关键。上帝怎么可能“绝不撇弃我们”？因为在十字架上，耶稣喊着说：“你为何离弃我？”——祂在我们的位置上被撇弃，好叫我们永远不被撇弃。

或者换个说法：耶稣失去了那荣耀。腓立比书第二章说，祂倒空自己，放下祂的荣耀；以赛亚书53章说，祂“无佳形美容使我们观看他”，也就是说，祂完全失去荣耀，变得令人怜悯、渺小、憔悴，变得微不足道。祂把一切荣耀都失去了，好让我们能如此确实、如此笃定地得着荣耀，以至于保罗可以用过去式来描述，好像已经发生。

如果真是这样，我相信保罗是这样说的——这是我通读整章经文、包括我们上周稍微谈过的内容后所得出的理解：保罗在说，我十分清楚人生的残酷，我绝不是戴着粉红色眼镜看世界，我也没有那种“意念战胜物质”的乐观主义。我绝不会说：哦，其实事情没有那么糟，只要你学会换个角度看……不，我深知人生的残酷，甚至是必然的残酷，以至于如果我不知道前面有荣耀临到我，我根本不可能在这一片苦难当中过有意义的生活。

保罗在说：唯有“荣耀”使我们有可能真实而清醒地面对生命有多糟糕，却仍能在苦难当中活出有意义的生命，甚至是

得胜的生命。只有真正知道他在这里所说的、在前面18节所说的、在哥林多后书第4章所说的，才能如此。他在那里说：“我想，现在的苦楚，若比起将来要显于我们的荣耀，就不足介意。”在哥林多后书第4章，他又说：如今短暂轻微的苦楚，要为我们成就极重无比、永远的荣耀；外体虽然毁坏，内心却一天新似一天。

他在说什么？这里至少有两层意思，我也会用这两点来作结。首先，他是在说：如果你明白保罗在这里所说的，你就会知道，当我们在基督里受苦、仍紧紧抓住基督的时候，这苦难会让我们变得更加“真实”。也就是说，它会让我们变得更有实质。

“荣耀”这个字，从词源上说，本来就有“重量”“坚实”的含义。其实，如果你想一想，我们整个系列都在谈这一点：每个人都很重视自己的事业，所以一旦事业出问题，当然会感到动摇。但如果你整个生命都建造在事业上，你的全部身份都系在事业上，那么事业一出问题，你整个人就会被击碎——完全碎掉，好像里面再也没有一个“自己”可以站立。

这就是为什么，我们不能把全部重量压在那些不断变动、持续摇晃的东西上。相反，当你把重量压在磐石上，当你更深地扎根在神的爱里、扎根在祂对你的评价、祂为你所做的一切里，你会变得更坚实、更稳定，甚至更“真实”。也就是说，你渐渐成为一个无论如何都会存留、站得住的人。

当苦难把你推向神、更深地逼你进入神和祂为你所成就的一切之中时，它其实是在使你变得更“真实”。我之所以知道保罗是对的，是因为《绒布小兔》也同意他的观点。举个例子，皮马（那匹皮做的老马）对绒布小兔说：“当一个孩子长久长久地爱你，你就会变成真实的。”绒布小兔问：“会痛吗？”皮马回答：“哦，是会痛的。这也是为什么不会发生在那些容易坏、必须小心翼翼保护的玩具身上。等到你真正变成‘真实’的时候，你身上的毛大多被爱得掉光了，眼睛也掉了出来，关节松松垮垮，整个人看上去非常破旧。但一旦你是真的，你就不会再显得丑，除非在那些不懂的人眼里。”

你也知道约翰·牛顿那首赞美诗，其中有几句是上帝对我们说的话：“这些内在的试炼，是我所使用的，要将你从骄傲和自我中释放出来，要打碎你那些地上的喜乐计划，好叫你在我里面找到你的一切。”

所以首先，苦难正在使你现在就更有荣耀——你的里面一天新似一天，荣耀正在为你预备那极重的荣耀。但不止如此，将来的荣耀还会压倒一切。保罗说，他“想”——也就是他反复思量、计算的结果——如今的苦楚根本无法和将要显与我们的荣耀相比。将来的荣耀会完全压倒一切，为我们带来新的视角，使我们能面对眼前的一切。

这也是为什么阿维拉的德兰修女能说：来自耶稣的第一个吻、天堂荣耀的第一秒钟，将让你这一生所有的苦难，看起来就好像只是在一家糟糕旅馆里过了一夜。这也是为什么陀思妥耶夫斯基可以说：我相信一切苦难终将被医治、被弥补；在世界的终局、在那永恒和谐的时刻，会发生一件极其宝贵的事，足以安慰所有心灵、弥补所有怨恨、赎尽人类所有的罪行、所有所流的血，使人不仅可以原谅这一切，甚至可以在某种意义上称这一切为“正当”。

这听起来极其激进，但保罗所讲的大致就是这样的事。

现在，让我把这一切收束起来。你明白了吗？荣耀此刻已经在使你——更准确说，是苦难此刻已经在使你变得更有荣耀，而将来要显出的荣耀又要完全遮蔽这一切。C.S.路易斯有一个比喻，也是一则故事，把这些都串联在一起，我现在就念给你听，不再多加评论。

有一次，人问作家弗兰纳里·奥康纳：“你能不能用一句话解释你的故事在讲什么？”她回答说：“如果我能用一句话说清楚，就不用写整个故事了。”

对接下来这段也是一样。不要问我它到底是什么意思——它所表达的，超出我能用几句解释的话。

故事讲的是一个来自地狱的鬼魂——你知道的，不太真实、飘忽不定——来到了天国的郊外（这是一个虚构故事），他远远地眺望着天堂。一个天使下来迎接他，但在他肩上趴着一只小红蜥蜴，那蜥蜴坚决不肯往天堂的方向走，于是鬼魂只好很难过地转身要走。

天使喊住他说：“嘿，你为什么这么快就要走？”鬼魂说：“嗯，这小家伙不愿意往那边去，所以我也没办法。”天使说：“你愿不愿意让我让它安静下来？”鬼魂说：“那倒是会松一口气。”天使说：“那我就把它杀了。”

鬼魂说：“哦，你刚才可没说要把它杀掉。”天使说：“这是唯一的办法。我可以杀掉它吗？”鬼魂支吾着说：“呃，我们先讨论讨论吧。”天使说：“没有时间了。我可以杀掉它吗？”鬼魂说：“哦，你看，它睡着了。我相信它以后不会再惹麻烦了。”天使说：“会的。我可以杀掉它吗？”鬼魂说：“嗯，我觉得循序渐进总比——”天使打断他说：“不，循序渐进完全没用。我可以杀掉它吗？”

“退后！你弄疼我了！”鬼魂叫道，“你没说这会让我疼。”天使说：“我从没说不疼，我只是说不会要了你的命。我可以杀掉它吗？”鬼魂说：“这样吧，让我先坐今晚的车回去，问问我自己的医生，再尽快回来找你。”天使回答说：“这一刻已经包含了所有的时刻。我可以杀掉它吗？”

这时，蜥蜴开始对鬼魂大吵大闹，大到所有人都听得见它说的话：“他真的可以做到。他真的能杀了我。那样你以后怎么办？哦，我承认，以前我有时候是做得太过分了，但我保证以后不会了，我会很乖的。”

“我可以杀掉它吗？”天使又问。鬼魂喊道：“好，做吧，做吧，赶紧结束这一切……但是——求神帮帮我，求神帮帮我。”然后天使抓住那只蜥蜴，扭断了它的脖子，把它摔到地上，鬼魂痛得惨叫。接着两件奇妙的事发生了。

首先，那个鬼魂不再像鬼魂，而是变得光辉灿烂、美丽明亮、真实有质感，成了一个人——一个真正的男人。其次，那只红蜥蜴的尸体并没有消失，反而长成了一匹美丽、有力的白马。

故事继续说：那新造的人站起来时，我以为他脸上闪烁的是泪水，但也许那只是从他身上流淌出来的爱与光的液态辉光。带着喜乐的急切，那人一跃骑上白马。他们像流星一样掠过绿色的平原，很快朝着群山奔去。仍旧像一颗星星，我看见他们一路盘旋而上，飞快地跨过看似不可能攀登的台阶，越来越快，直到抵达地平线的顶端，高到我几乎要仰断脖子才能看见他们。然后他们消失了——自己也变成光，融入那永恒清晨的玫瑰色光辉之中。

“我们这至暂至轻的苦楚，要为我们成就极重无比、永远的荣耀。”

“因为我深信，无论是死、是生，是天使、是掌权的，是有能的，是现在的事、将来的事，是高处的、是低处的，是别的受造之物，都不能叫我们与神的爱隔绝，这爱是在我们的主基督耶稣里的。”

我们一起祷告。

父啊，我们的坏事终将变成好处，我们最真实的好东西永远不会被夺去，而我们最好的事还在前头。求你让圣诞所指向的这些真实，借着这些真理在我们生命中发挥功效；让这些真理在我们里面动工，使我们变得真实，使我们在哀伤与苦难当中，仍旧能够活出有意义，甚至喜乐的生命。我们感谢你，这一切在耶稣里都成为可能。奉祂的名祷告，阿们。

我只念给你听，不再多作解释。有一次，人问作家弗兰纳里·奥康纳：“你能不能用一句话告诉我们，你的故事到底在讲什么？用一行、一句话总结就好。”她回答说：“如果我能用一行或一句话说清楚，我就不需要写整个故事了。”

对接下来这个故事，我也得说同样的话。别问它到底是什么意思——它所表达的，比我能用几句话说明的要多得多。

故事是关于一个来自地狱的鬼魂——你知道的，不太真实、忽隐忽现——他来到了天国的郊外（当然，这只是个虚构的故事），一心渴望着天堂。一个天使下来要来迎见他，但在他肩上趴着一只小红蜥蜴，那蜥蜴死活不肯往天堂的方向走，于是鬼魂只好很难过地转身要离开。

天使大声喊道：“嘿，你怎么这么快就要走？”鬼魂说：“嗯，这小东西不愿意往那个方向走，所以我也走不了。”天使说：“你愿不愿意让我让它安静下来？”鬼魂说：“那倒会让我轻松不少。”天使说：“那我就把它杀了。”

鬼魂说：“哦，你刚才可没说要把它杀掉。”天使回答：“这是唯一的办法。我可以杀掉它吗？”鬼魂说：“呃，我们先谈谈这个问题。”天使说：“没时间谈。我可以杀掉它吗？”鬼魂说：“哦，你看，它睡着了。我敢说它以后不会再惹麻烦。”天使说：“会的。我可以杀掉它吗？”鬼魂说：“嗯，我觉得循序渐进总比——”天使打断说：“不，循序渐进一点用也没有。我可以杀掉它吗？”

“退后！你弄痛我了！”鬼魂喊道，“你没说这会让我疼。”天使说：“我从没说不疼，我只是说不会要了你的命。我可以杀掉它吗？”鬼魂说：“这样吧，让我先坐今晚的车回去，问问我自己的医生，再尽快回来找你。”天使回答：“这一刻包含了所有的时刻。我可以杀掉它吗？”

这时，那只蜥蜴开始朝鬼魂大声嚷嚷，大到所有人都听得见它在说什么：“他真的能下手。他真能杀了我。那样你以后怎么办？哦，我承认，以前有时候我做得太过分了，但我保证以后不会了，我会很乖的。”

“我可以杀掉它吗？”天使又问。“好，动手吧，动手吧，赶紧结束这事。”鬼魂哭喊道，“只是——求神帮助我，求神帮助我。”于是天使抓住那只蜥蜴，扭断了它的脖子，把它摔在地上，鬼魂痛得尖叫起来。接着，两件奇妙的事发生了。

首先，鬼魂不再像鬼魂，而是变得光彩照人、美丽明亮、真实有分量，成了一个人——一个真正的男人。其次，那只红蜥蜴的身体并没有消失，反而长成了一匹美丽、强壮的白马。

故事继续说：那新造的人站起来时，我以为他脸上闪烁的是泪水，但也许那只是从他身上流淌出来的液态之爱和明亮光辉。带着欢喜急切，他一跃骑上白马。他们像流星一样掠过绿色的平原，很快奔向群山。仍旧像一颗星，我看见他们一路盘旋而上，跨越看似不可能攀登的台阶，脚步一刻比一刻更快，直到来到地势的至高处，高得让我几乎要仰断脖子才能看见他们。然后他们消失了——自己也成了光，融入那永恒清晨玫瑰色的光辉之中。

“我们这至暂至轻的苦楚，要为我们成就极重无比、永远的荣耀。”

“因为我深信，无论是死、是生，是天使、是掌权的，是有能的，是现在的事、将来的事，是高处的、是低处的，是别的受造之物，都不能叫我们与神的爱隔绝，这爱是在我们的主基督耶稣里的。”

让我们祷告。

父啊，我们的坏事终将变成好处，我们最真实的好东西永远不能被夺去，而我们最好的事还在前头。求你让圣诞所指向的这些现实，借着这些真理，在我们生命中发挥功效；让这些真理在我们里面运行，使我们变得真实，使我们在忧伤和苦难中，仍能活出有意义、甚至喜乐的生命。我们感谢你，这一切在耶稣里都成为可能。奉祂的名求，阿们。
