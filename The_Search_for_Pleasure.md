today's podcast, Tim Keller looks at how Ecclesiastes helps us face our doubts, fears,  and uncertainties, and points us to the lasting hope and significance we have in Christ. The book of Ecclesiastes is very, very difficult, and I'm actually teaching it to try to  give you overviews. I think if anybody says, oh, this is great, and it's just down to just read it through  one time, you're just going to say, what in the world is this doing in the Bible? And we said last week that one of the reasons for this, one of the reasons for it's difficulty,  there are a number of them, and I can't go into all of them every time. I'm not here to give you a survey of Ecclesiastes as much as I'm here to give you to pull out  some basic themes that I think are relevant to us today, but Ecclesiastes is the only book  of the Bible that's written from the viewpoint of a skeptic, someone who is looking at life  without God, someone who's seeking after truth and who's not standing in the place of  a person who believes.

Now one of the reasons why it's a little difficult is because in the very beginning and at  the very end and a couple of places in the middle, it seems like the writer steps away from  his doubt and begins to make comments. And the reason for that, just to show my hand here, is my best understanding of what's  going on is that this is a piece of work, it's a brilliant piece of art, and it was also  very typical in the Old Testament times, in ancient times, and in that part of the world. For a person to make a point, by essentially taking on a role, in the very beginning and  the very end, the author talks about Ecclesiastes, this teacher, this commentator, he talks about  him in the third person, and then suddenly in chapter 1 verse 12, he goes in the first  person and says, I, the teacher, I did this and I did this and I did this, and then  at the very end he comes back out and says, what have we learned? Because what he's doing is he's, this is a man who is a believing person, who believes  in God, but he goes into a role and explores what it's like and explores the doubts and  the skepticism and difficulties of someone who's searching. And that's one of the reasons actually why, sometimes it's a little tough to interpret  unless you understand that, but on the other hand, it's also one of the reasons why it's  so relevant.

In December of 97, the New York Times magazine had a whole article, a whole issue on, it  was called God Decentralized, the lead article subtitle was, even people without faith are  searching for God. And when major newspapers and major magazines who are written and produced by editors and  managers and reporters who we know are generally speaking much less religious than the mainstream. When those places start to devote whole issues on a revival of religious seeking and religious  searching, then it just must be true. It must be happening. And I agree with them and agree with that particular issue that there is not yet, I don't think,  a revival of religious finding.

There's not a revival of spiritual finding. The churches in the synagogues of the country have not doubled in size, that's a revival. But there is a huge revival of religious searching, maybe not finding what's searching, absolutely. And this is the only book written from the viewpoint of a searcher. Now, when you go on a spiritual search, there are certain things that people always run  into.

Last week, we looked at one of them that the Ecclesiastes writer talks about, and that  is pain. What do we do about pain? What do we do about the problem of pain? There's a book called the problem of pain. In fact, there's lots of books that are essentially on the problem of pain.

What do we do about the evil and suffering and injustice of the world? But this week is another problem that you have to deal with of your spiritual searcher,  Seeker. And he brings this up, and he looks at it, and here's what he says. Let's read it. Ecclesiastes 2.1 to 11.

And then a section just a little later, chapter 3, verses 10 to 14, I'll read them together. So I thought in my heart. Well now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good, but that also proved  to be meaningless. After I said his foolish and what does pleasure accomplish, I tried cheering myself with wine  and embracing folly. My mind still guided me with wisdom.

I wanted to see what was worthwhile for men to do under heaven during the few days of  their lives. I undertook great projects. I built houses for myself and planted vineyards. I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them. I made reservoirs to water grows of flourishing trees.

I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me. I mass silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I acquired men and women's singers and a harem as well, and the delights of the heart  of man. I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me, and all my wisdom, and all this,  my wisdom, stayed with me.

I denied myself nothing, my eyes desired, I refused my heart no pleasure, my heart took  delight in all my work, and this was the reward for all my labor. Yet, when I surveyed all that my hands had done, and what I had toil to achieve, everything  was meaningless, a chasing after the wind, nothing was gained under the sun. I have seen the burden God has laid on men. He has made everything beautiful in its time. He also has set eternity in the hearts of men, yet they cannot fathom what God has done  from beginning to end.

I know that there is nothing better for men than to be happy and to do good while they  live, that everyone may eat and drink and find satisfaction in all his toil. This is the gift of God. I know that everything God does will endure forever. Nothing can be added to it, and nothing taken from it. God does it so that men will revere him.

Now what is the other problem? I said there is a problem of pain, but when you go out looking at life, there is another  problem out there. I know we don't tend to think of it as a problem, but it is, it is a spiritual problem,  same way. See, when you look at evil and suffering, we look at pain. It is a tremendous puzzle we saw last week, but there is pointers to God in it.

However, this week we are looking at the problem of pleasure. Not the problem of pain. You know, I know. If I talk to people about God, what do you think about God? I have a problem with God.

What is that problem? Well, pain, evil and suffering. I don't think I have ever really talked to anybody who said, yeah, I have a watch out  believing in God. Why? Pleasure.

Why is there pleasure in the world? Why is pleasure the way it is? My face is tonight and his face is tonight is it should bother you because pleasure is  a huge problem. For some of you tonight, there is note, and you know who you are, probably already. It is the biggest problem in your life.

Now, maybe you don't know who you are until we get through it, but some of you know  right away. Pleasure is a puzzle. Pleasure is a problem and pleasure has a lot of pointers in it. Now, what he teaches us is three things here, and I am going to put it this way. He teaches us what pleasure, what it promises, what it how it fails, actually, what it promises,  why it fails, and how it points beyond.

Okay? That is basically what he does all the way through in every one of his themes, but what  it promises, why it fails, and how it points beyond, first of all, what it promises. Here in verse 1 to 3, it gives us something that is really very, very intriguing. He says, so I thought in my heart, come now, I will test you with pleasure to find out  what is good. So I tried cheering myself with wine and bracing folly.

I wanted to see what was worthwhile for men to do under heaven during the few days of  their lives. Now, this is important. Look at the word come now. He doesn't go into his project, which is to live for pleasure until now. Well, what happened before?

See, he's coming out of something that he did in chapter 1, and I didn't print it for  you, and we don't have it in front of us, let me read it to you. He's already been through something, and then he turns to pleasure. That's very important to understand what he's saying. In chapter 1, he says, I devoted myself to study and explore by wisdom all that is done  under heaven. But when I saw all things under the sun, I saw all of them are meaningless, a chasing after  the wind, for with much wisdom comes much sorrow and the more knowledge, the more grief.

Now here's what he did. He did not decide at first to live for pleasure. He said, I am going to use my mind and go look at life, and I'm going to figure out what  the meaning of life is and what the purpose of life is and really what life is about and  why things happen that they do. Now, remember, and I read it to you, and we mentioned this last week, he said, I looked  at life to try to understand life under the sun. And the word under the sun, which he throws up again and again in the book of Ecclesiastes,  he tells us, he's looking at life like a practical secular person.

He's looking at life, as John Lennon says, imagine, no heaven, no hell, no eternity, just  this life, living for today. And he says, if that's all we have, we don't know what comes before, we don't know the  after. If that's all we have, he went there to try to figure out what the meaning of life was  and he, what did he decide, what did he determine, what did he conclude? He concluded, if this life all there is, there are no answers to the big questions. If this life is all there is, there's no answers to the big questions, what, what, what  were we here for?

What are we for? What is our purpose? What is right and wrong? What is the absolute moral standard? What is truth?

Where do we go when we die? There are no answers. And that's when he turns to pleasure. Now this is very important. When he looks at life as it is and comes and says there are no answers, and then he turns  to pleasure, he's recapitulating Western history.

First of all, you should know that those of us who live in America, you are living what  we are called Western society, increasingly it's broader than American and Europe because  of technology. But in Western society, we are the first society whose cultural leaders as a whole have said,  there are no answers. I mean, there's never been a society that wasn't built on some kind of religion or philosophy  that said here are the answers. It could have been Buddhist, it could have been shinto, it could be islamic, Christianity,  Judaism, something. But we're really the first one, even, and I would just say, what about communism?

No, sorry, communism also believed. They know the answers, they know where history is going, they know what's what you're supposed  to be doing, they know it, they understand, right? They give the answers. Now, they're all maybe different, you know, they're contradict, they can't all be right. But here's the thing, where the only one who actually says, there are none.

This life is all there is. When you die, that's it, we have no idea why we're here. And we're building a civilization on that. Now what happens when you do that? I'll tell you, let me give you a little vignette, actually we have a little vignette right  here, but let me give you another one.

In radio days, I think that's the name I got. The Woody Allen movie radio days, early on in the beginning of the movie, a boy goes  to class, this will teach you to go to science class now. He goes to class and he hears something and he's just distraught, he's depressed, he's  going crazy. And the mother has to drag him to a counselor and sit them down and the counselor says, what's  going on? And the little boy says, you know, he's about eight or nine years old and I guess he's been  a week or two now since he discovered this, but he says, do you know that the universe is  expanding?

Do you realize that eventually everything's going to burn up? Do you realize everything's going to be over? What's the use of doing anything? Now what does the counselor say? In any other civilization, the counselor would say, that's just not true.

There's plenty of reason. This is not all there is. There's right, there's wrong, there's God, there's eternity, there's, you know what they  would say. But the counselor can't say anything to him because he's right, however he's also crazy. And if you persist in that, in this society, we'll call him crazy, why?

GK Chesterton said, in our society, insanity, insane people are not illogical. In our society, insane people are only logical. In other words, this little boy was saying, I understand finally from school what life's  about. There's no answers. Everything's going to burn up.

Nobody means anything. In the end, it makes no difference what I do. Everything's going to be over. See, he's being logical and that's why it's on the verge of being put away. Because you see, there's nobody out.

There's never been a civilization that had a set of non-answers to the basic questions. Every other society, though, they may be, maybe they're wrong. I mean, for my viewpoint, as a Christian, some of them definitely are wrong. But at least they were there. And therefore, there was no, there was no danger of people going insane by simply logically  taking out what the culture says about the reality.

This little boy is ready to go crazy. So what do they say to him? What do you say to anybody that starts talking like that? Lighting up. Eat an ice cream cone, play a game of ball.

If he was a little older, they say, you know, go out, kiss a girl, have sex, climb a mountain,  look at the view. You know, smell the roses. Come on. Now what are they saying? Now that just sounds like, yeah, yeah, you know what it is.

They're turning to pleasure for what? Look at verse three, for a sense of being worthwhile. The reason in our society, when you don't have anything bigger than yourself to live for,  when you don't know what truth is, when you have no cause worth dying for, you're not  dying for your family, you're not dying for the truth, you're not dying for nation,  you're not dying for God. You know, there is nothing bigger than you, therefore there are no answers to the questions. What do we do?

Since there's no objective meaning, we try to manufacture subjective meaning. Because our wisdom shows us that things are meaningless, therefore we turn to pleasure. But we're not pleasure now becomes very complicated. We expect pleasure. We see a promise here that is much, there's more going on here than pleasure.

In our society, by and large, we are not just going after pleasure. I mean, rats go after pleasure. Rats have sex and it's just about sex. But when we have sex, it's not just the physical experience, also what starts to happen. You start to say, I'm loved, I'm valued, my life is worthwhile.

See, that's what verse three is about. He turned to pleasure, not for pleasure. He turned to pleasure to deal with the fact that he had nothing bigger to live for. And he wasn't looking just for pleasure. He wasn't looking just for sex.

He was looking that he wanted to have that, I know this is on tape. There's a physical orgasm, there's a spiritual orgasm. The physical is a matter of certain chemicals hitting the hypothalamus. But the spiritual is to say, life is worthwhile, my life, there's love. All right, Bernstein says, when he listens to Beethoven's fifth, he doesn't just tap his  feet.

You listen to music, you can't help it. There's a physical thing about music, you listen to music, what is that? What's going on there? Physical, it's neurological. Neurological system is...

You're on the tape, I just made funny, rhythmic, you know, I don't know what the people  on the tape are going to figure what you're laughing at, I was just sort of making funny  rhythmic movements, okay. I'm just trying to be thoughtful. Beethoven says, pardon me, Bernstein says, when I hear Beethoven, I feel that something  is right in the world, something is right in the universe, something checks out, something  that obeys its own laws consistently, something that will never let us down. You know that quote, one of my favorite quotes, but what is he saying? My life is worthwhile, I was reading, back in July, there was a New York Times magazine  article called Lux Populi, not Vox Populi, and it was about the fact that luxury items  are being sold, very expensive luxury items, instead of just being sold to people who live  in just a few rich people someplace, they're being sold everywhere, people are putting out  an incredible amount of money for luxury items, and at one point one of the people who  makes these luxury items was being interviewed and said, they asked, you know, look, okay,  your sweaters are 20 times more expensive than the next sweater, are your sweaters really  20 times better than the next competitor?

And what does he say? He said, we sell dreams, he explained, when you see one of our boutiques and you go in  and you buy lipstick or you buy this or that, it has the dream in it, now what is he saying? What a nice euphemistic way of putting it, but he's right, there's something more than  pleasure going on here, there's something more than the feel of probably, you know, his  sweaters probably are incredibly comfortable, but there's something much different, just  like it's sex is not about sex now, and music is not about music, what he's really saying  is you buy that sweater so you know, my life is worthwhile, you're manufacturing subjective  meaning, but let us be clear what's going on. In a society that has no objective meaning, there is going to be a kind of freneticness  about pleasure, and really, I'm not sure we can ever say that there has ever been a society,  I mean society has always had its pleasures, but has there ever been a society that puts  the metabolism and entertainment into sexual activity, into material, you know, luxuries  that we do, there's never been one, maybe the Greco-Roman world as it was beginning to  fall apart, but that's also because just like the Ecclesiastes guy says here, it was because  they had lost their ability to believe in any objective meaning, and so they had  to turn, and therefore they turned to pleasure, not just for pleasure, but a sense of worth  wildness. Now, before I move on, you understand, let me apply this to you personally, what does  it mean to live a life of pleasure?

A lot of you don't think you're doing it, because you see, one of the things here is in  the very beginning and it says, laughter is foolish, see verse two, and what's this pleasure  accomplished. After in pleasure, two Hebrew words, they're not really synonyms. Laughter really means a kind of orgy. Laughter means to lose your discernment, whereas pleasure, the second word, has more  of a sense of refinement aesthetics, and you see, one is a whole heart, full-throated  party in orgy, the other is refinement. One is get smashed, the other one is buy art, but let me tell you,  he is saying, they are the same, they are the same.

You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger  brother. In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who  try to earn his love by being good. In his book The prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart  of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental  older brother, and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal, extravagant grace. Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith, the prodigal God will help  you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way. The prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel in life share  the hope, enjoy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the world.

When it comes right down to it, I don't know whether you are having a lot of sex or whether  you just have a job that you hate because it's not doing anything productive for anybody  but it's making enough money so that someday you'll be able to do the things you want  to do. That's the same thing as a person who's partying all the time. You see there's a downtown and the uptown approach to hedonism but you see there's  Oprah Winfrey and there's Jerry Springer but it's the same. What is the bottom line in your life?

Do you have anything worth dying for? Do you have anything that you'd go to the mat for? Is there any truth that this is the bottom line? So really is it comfort, affluence? Is it good feeling?

Is it sensory pleasure? If you do that, you're not doing it just for pleasure. You're looking to get a life. You're looking to get a sense of worth wellness and it's going to fail. That's the second point.

The first point is what it promises, the second point he gives us and shows us is it  fails and it explains why. Now, one of the things it's important to understand and boy, this is very powerful. This is not a regular guy. No, it isn't. First 10, I denied myself nothing, my eyes desired.

Now what's that? I denied myself nothing, my eyes desired. Now there's only 99.99% of people cannot say that. All of us deny ourselves all sorts of things our eyes desire, mainly because we don't  have the money or the power to take them. And because of that, most of us are going down this path and pleasure is our bottom line  and it is the main thing we're living for, even though by and large, unless we're party  hearty types, we kind of really, really hide that from ourselves.

I'm trying to reveal this to some of you here tonight. But he said, if you're going down that path and you're empty, instead of saying there's  something wrong with the path, we have a tendency to say it's because I haven't gone  far enough. If I could build that house in the lake, if I could have a better love life, if I could  just lose weight, in other words, because you haven't gone far enough down, that's the  reason why you feel like you're empty. You're blaming yourself when it's the path. And what's so very powerful about this, when he is depicting himself as the greatest,  the greatest, one of the 0.001% who actually was able to do anything he wanted to satisfy  any sensory pleasure.

Now somebody says, well, how do I know that really happened? You kind of made me wonder, is this person really a king or was he taken the role of a  king? It doesn't matter. Here's what he's trying to say. I challenge you.

Look at the lives of the people who are in that 0.001%. Read their biographies, read their interviews. They found exactly what he has. They're just not, the reason they're so unhappy and the reason they're so jevastated is  they're not living in the avail of illusion that we are, because they got to the end of  the road and there was a dead end. And we're empty, but we say, well, if I only got further down, well, they got down there.

That's the reason why they're so unhappy. They're not happy because they're rich. They're unhappy because they got to the end of the road. And they saw, they were still just them. It's a powerful argument for the fact that pleasure ultimately fails us.

Not that it fails to deliver the orgasm. Not that it fails to deliver the neurological rhythm. Not that it fails to deliver the comfort of the nice sweater, but it fails to deliver  worth-wildness. It fails to give you what you're really looking for in that is transcendence. We are looking for a way to do an in-run around the fact we have nothing to live for.

We have nothing solid. We have nothing we're sure of. We have nothing that's going to take us to the stars. We have nothing that we think will last past us, to see. We're looking for transcendence, and it will fail at that.

Utterly fail. In two ways, number one, pleasure will fail to distract you. In verse three, he says, my mind was still guided you with wisdom. He said, I tried cheering myself with wine and bracing folly, but my mind was still guiding  me. Down in verse nine, he says, I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem.

In all this, my wisdom stayed with me. What is that? What's he talking about? I'll tell you what he's talking about. This is one of my, as some of you know, one of my favorite quotes from C.S.

Lewis. What he's trying to say is, no matter how hard I tried, through pleasure to forget the  fact that I had nothing to live for and nothing means anything, I tried and it broke through. Pleasure. See, subjective pleasure, trying to talk to wipe out the lack of objective pleasure is  like trying to butter too much bread with too little butter. You know, you spread it and by the time the knife gets to the end, there's no butter there.

I mean, it wasn't enough butter, it just sunk in. And in the same way, subjective pleasure fails because no matter how hard he tried to  stop thinking, his wisdom stayed with and the truth kept coming through, you know. If your life, if your origin is an accident and your destiny is just rot, if your life,  if your origin is insignificant and your destiny is insignificant, have the guts to admit  your life is insignificant. Well, now that thought, we try to keep away, but is what Lewis says. He says, let us suppose that nature is all that exists.

This meaningless play of atoms and space in time by a series of a hundred chances has  regrettably produced things like ourselves, conscious beings who now know that their own  consciousness is an accidental result of the whole meaningless process and is therefore  self-meaningless, though to us, alas, we feel significant. In this situation, you might decide to simply have as good time as possible, right? Say, hey, life is meaningless. Let's have a great time. Why not?

What difference does it make? I might as well have these great feelings. You might decide to have as good a time as possible, but you can't accept it now, listen. You can't accept in the lowest animal sense. Maybe in love with a girl if you know and you remember that your view of the world means  that all the beauties of her person and her character are a momentary and accidental  pattern produced by the collision of atoms and your own response to them is only a sort  of psychic chemical phosphorescence, arising from the behavior of your genetic material, and  you can't go on getting very serious pleasure for music if you know and remember that its  air significance is a pure illusion that you like it only because your nervous system  is irrationally conditioned to like it.

Yes, you may still in the lowest sense of a good time, but just in so far as it becomes  very good, just in so far as it ever threatens to push you from cold sensuality on into real  warmth and real enthusiasm and real joy, so far will you be forced to feel the hopeless  disharmony between your own emotions and the universe in which you think you really  live. It will break through. As time goes on, even if it's unconscious or semi-conscious, the fact that you've got  nothing to live for, the wisdom breaks through. It creates a grimness, it creates a joylessness no matter how much pleasure you try to take,  but not only does pleasure fail to distract us from the lack of objective reality, but  secondly, it fails to satisfy. Because down in verse 11, at the climax, he says, I looked at it all and everything was  meaningless, a chasing after the wind, that was chasing after the wind.

Wind is something you can't keep. Wind can be a wonderful experience, but you can't keep it, you can't say, ah, let me grab  that thing so I can have that wind tomorrow, it can't be done. Now on the physical and spiritual level, see, here's what's frightening, I said, that  especially in our society, what's really going on when we seek pleasure is we're not after  just the physical sensory pleasure, we're after transcendence, we're after worth  wildness. Well, first of all, one of the most awful things to know, and addiction counselors will  tell you this, is that pleasurable agents, at first give you a rush, but then there's  a tolerance factor, pleasurable agents at, you know, A amount, you know, five liters  of such a pleasurable agent will give you a great, great experience the first time,  but the next time it'll take a little more to get the same amount of experience, the  same amount of pleasure. And next time a little bit more, next time a little bit more because we adapt and pleasurable  agents wear off in their ability to create pleasure.

And that's how addictions happen. You need more and you need more and you need more and if you're lucky, you can break it  off before it completely destroys you and then you just be empty. And that's physical pleasure, physical pleasure is like the wind, it just doesn't stay. If you give it, if you really rely on it, not if you enjoy it, but if you just rely on  it, if you go to it for transcendence, especially it cannot deliver. And Lewis, of course, has some classic stuff about the fact that it's not just physically  the pleasure we can't hold on to, but spiritually it disappoints us in this way.

He says in one of his more famous quotes, he says, all of your life, there's been an unattainable  ecstasy that's hovered just beyond the grasp of your consciousness. The loft on the verge of breaking through, you know, when you're in a boat or when you're  falling in love, you know, when he says, he says, when you're starting into a pleasurable  experience, you think, ah, finally, I'll be worth this is it, somehow this is it. He says off on the verge of breaking through and yet you've never had it. All the things that have ever deeply possessed you, your soul, have been but hints of it,  tantalizing glimpses, promises never quite fulfilled, echoes that died away just as they  were caught year-year. It's the secret signature of each soul.

With the incomunicable and unappeasable want, the thing we desire before we met our wives  or made our friends or chose our work and which we shall still desire on our deathbeds  when the mind is no longer knowing wife or friend or work. The books of the music in which we thought the beauty was located will betray us if we  trust in them. It was not in them, it only comes through them. If they are mistaken for the thing itself, they turn into dumb idols, breaking the hearts  of their worshipers. For they are not the thing itself, they are only the scent of the flower we have not found,  the echo of a tune we have not heard, news from a country we have never yet visited.

It gets a music we are born remembering. There's a music we're born remembering, we're trying to hear in music. There's a scent we're born remembering, we're trying to smell in the flower. Now, what is that? I believe that even though how do you prove it, I can prove it just by saying it.

We know that this is true, that that sense of transcendence does not come through. As he said, the best marriage is the best career is the best houses, in fact, people who  get to the very end of the road find it hasn't got their other ones that know the best. Those of us who don't have these wonderful pleasures, we're still in the avail of illusion  we think, if only, no. Well, why would this be? Why isn't pleasure enough?

Why do we want to go beyond? Well, here's the pointer in chapter three. It says, and there's a lot more in chapter three, but we just can't go into it all tonight. He says, he has made everything beautiful in his time. He has also said eternity in the hearts of men yet they cannot fathom what God has done  from beginning to end.

Now that's something pretty interesting. Take a look at this. First of all, he says there's all sorts of beautiful things out there. In fact, if you want to know the definition of a pleasure, it's beauty. Do you want to know the definition of beauty?

A beauty is something. Something is beautiful rather than instrumental. Something is beautiful if it's pleasurable in itself, just for itself. You see, if you studied art because you had to get an A in a class, and then as soon as  the class was over, you never went to see art. Art is fine.

Okay. It's just instrumental. It's not beautiful. But if afterwards you would go when you didn't have to, when it doesn't get you anywhere  as a matter of fact, it costs you money. You see, something is beautiful rather than instrumental.

Something is beautiful when it gives you pleasure just because of your delight in it, just  to see it, just to let it be there, just to put it on your eyes, on your tongue, on your  ear, on your heart. That's what something is. It's beautiful. But we have seen that there's something wrong because the beautiful things that we set  our hearts on, addict us, and yet at the same time, they don't satisfy us. Why?

Well, it's the second clause. He has put eternity in the hearts of men. That's almost a unique verse in the Bible. He has put endlessness in our hearts. What that means is that there is a desire for an eternal beauty, and that all the beauties  that are here, if we set our hearts on them, as Lewis said, they disappoint us because  they are only the scent of the flower we haven't smelled.

They're only the hint, the echo of a tune we haven't really heard. You know, if there's a music we're born remembering, well, what is it? Well, in general, it's the face of God. Psalm 16, verse 11, in thy face is fullness of joy in thy right hand, their pleasures  for evermore. Psalm 27, verse 4.

One thing, that's an addict. One thing do I seek after. One thing do I ask for to gaze on the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple. Now, in general, this is a challenge to everybody. If this is true, a lot of people are in trouble.

A lot of you have said, I believe in God, fine, why? Can I ask you why? I believe in God. Why? Okay.

Well, what do you do about it? Well, I go to church, or I obey to think commandments. Why? Because I ought to. Why?

Let me keep pushing you. In the end, there's only two, see Christians, real Christians whose lives have been changed,  and whose attitude toward pleasures is so different because we can enjoy them. We're not afraid of them now, but on the other hand, they are not the main thing, so they  don't addict us either. The difference between a Christian whose life has really been changed, and a religious  person is this, religious people find God useful, instrumental, and Christians are people  who have finally found them beautiful, who obey Him just because of who He is. Wouldn't care what else it brought them, just for the delight.

You see, religious people and Christians, they share obedience, religious people and Christians  may be desperate for God. They might be obedient to God, so they may have all sorts of awe and reverence to God,  but the difference between a Christian and just a religious person and a nice person  is that they find them useful, but Christians find them beautiful, that you come after Him  and you seek Him and you obey Him because of the beauty of who He is. Has that been true of you? Have you experienced that? That's what real Christianity is.

Well, somebody says, wow, how, how could that happen? Here's the answer. Jesus Christ, can I tell you what the gospel is? The Bible actually gives you the gospel in terms of beauty. We, because of our sin, have made the world ugly.

We've made our souls ugly. We've made the world ugly. How are we going to be saved from our sin? We're told in Isaiah chapter 53, the servant came from heaven and he came to earth and we're  told this about him. He had, this is, this is Isaiah 53, he had no beauty that we should desire him.

Jesus Christ lost his beauty. Jesus Christ became ugly. Jesus Christ became shriveled. Jesus Christ lost his glory and he lost his beauty. Why?

That's the first half. Because of our sin and what did he do when he died on the cross? He died on the cross in our place so that when we believe in him, what are we told? In Colossians chapter 1, verse 22, there it tells us so that now when we believe in  God, with Jesus, God looks at us and he sees us wholly and spotless without blemish. Listen, religion says, obey God or he'll get you.

The gospel said you've made the world ugly and yourself ugly. Jesus Christ came and lost his beauty so that now when you believe in him, you don't  just now, you know, you know, that doesn't just make you a better person in some way. You're beautiful in God's sight. You are in a sheer beauty to him because he lost his beauty so you could get it. Now, if I tell you obey God or he'll get you, you'll have to treat him as instrumental  and frankly, every religion essentially tells you that.

But the gospel says, no, look at what he's done for you. That's beautiful. Do you believe you're a sinner? Do you believe you're lost? Now a lot of you wouldn't.

I mean, you live in New York. A lot of you wouldn't. Do you know what that means? Until you see that, you'll never find them beautiful. You'll only find them instrumental and you'll never have the things in your heart that are  addicting you thrown out for a greater beauty.

Your heart needs an object of beauty. You can't get rid of the ones that are holding on to you just by trying to throw them out. They have to be displaced by a higher beauty, a greater beauty, and this is it. You'll never find him beautiful. If you just say he's very big and he's very big and I better obey him because he'll crush  me.

Now, why don't we get beauty that way? But only if you see that you're a sinner and you see what he's done. That's how you become a Christian, seeing the beauty of the Lord. But now, some of you are Christians and you know what you're saying? You're saying, I am a Christian, but I'm addicted to something.

All right? That's because you're not gazing on his beauty. You're not gazing. Well, you say, how do I gaze on this beauty? Well, it'd really be another sermon, however.

Just let me just tell you three things. First of all, you have to get to know Jesus, not God in general, Jesus. Jesus became a human being. He became a sensory person, a human being. He entered into our sensory environment because we can have this kind of intimacy with him  so he can really be a beauty to us.

I have to read about him. You have to get to know everything you can about him, everything. That's first. Then secondly, prayer is very deep. First thing is, get to know Jesus.

Secondly, don't think prayer is easy or simple. If you want to make him a professional baseball player, it's going to take a long time. You can't just get out there. Here's a bat. Here's a ball.

I throw up in the air. I hit the ball. I'm going to go show up. It's Shay Stadium. Hey, I understand you're in a wild car race.

Do you need somebody? It takes years and years and years. And prayer is a lot harder than that. You haven't even begun to figure out the depths of prayer. You haven't begun to look at praise.

You haven't begun to see what happens through repentance. Beauty happens. You see the beauty of his majesty. You see the beauty of his symmetry. You see the beauty of his fragility, of his weakness.

You just see it. It comes in prayer. But thirdly, you need the Holy Spirit because you know an artwork needs a light. Every art gallery has lights. And Jesus Christ is nothing without Holy Spirit.

But Jesus says, when the Spirit comes, he will glorify me. He will take of mine and he will glorify me. Ask the Spirit, learn to pray, look at Jesus, and know that real thing that your heart  needs to overcome your addictions is not just a general knowledge of who he is in trying  harder, but an experience of his beauty.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today's podcast, Tim Keller looks at how Ecclesiastes helps us face our doubts, fears,  and uncertainties, and points us to the lasting hope and significance we have in Christ. The book of Ecclesiastes is very, very difficult, and I'm actually teaching it to try to  give you overviews. I think if anybody says, oh, this is great, and it's just down to just read it through  one time, you're just going to say, what in the world is this doing in the Bible? And we said last week that one of the reasons for this, one of the reasons for it's difficulty,  there are a number of them, and I can't go into all of them every time. I'm not here to give you a survey of Ecclesiastes as much as I'm here to give you to pull out  some basic themes that I think are relevant to us today, but Ecclesiastes is the only book  of the Bible that's written from the viewpoint of a skeptic, someone who is looking at life  without God, someone who's seeking after truth and who's not standing in the place of  a person who believes.

Now one of the reasons why it's a little difficult is because in the very beginning and at  the very end and a couple of places in the middle, it seems like the writer steps away from  his doubt and begins to make comments. And the reason for that, just to show my hand here, is my best understanding of what's  going on is that this is a piece of work, it's a brilliant piece of art, and it was also  very typical in the Old Testament times, in ancient times, and in that part of the world. For a person to make a point, by essentially taking on a role, in the very beginning and  the very end, the author talks about Ecclesiastes, this teacher, this commentator, he talks about  him in the third person, and then suddenly in chapter 1 verse 12, he goes in the first  person and says, I, the teacher, I did this and I did this and I did this, and then  at the very end he comes back out and says, what have we learned? Because what he's doing is he's, this is a man who is a believing person, who believes  in God, but he goes into a role and explores what it's like and explores the doubts and  the skepticism and difficulties of someone who's searching. And that's one of the reasons actually why, sometimes it's a little tough to interpret  unless you understand that, but on the other hand, it's also one of the reasons why it's  so relevant.

In December of 97, the New York Times magazine had a whole article, a whole issue on, it  was called God Decentralized, the lead article subtitle was, even people without faith are  searching for God. And when major newspapers and major magazines who are written and produced by editors and  managers and reporters who we know are generally speaking much less religious than the mainstream. When those places start to devote whole issues on a revival of religious seeking and religious  searching, then it just must be true. It must be happening. And I agree with them and agree with that particular issue that there is not yet, I don't think,  a revival of religious finding.

There's not a revival of spiritual finding. The churches in the synagogues of the country have not doubled in size, that's a revival. But there is a huge revival of religious searching, maybe not finding what's searching, absolutely. And this is the only book written from the viewpoint of a searcher. Now, when you go on a spiritual search, there are certain things that people always run  into.

Last week, we looked at one of them that the Ecclesiastes writer talks about, and that  is pain. What do we do about pain? What do we do about the problem of pain? There's a book called the problem of pain. In fact, there's lots of books that are essentially on the problem of pain.

What do we do about the evil and suffering and injustice of the world? But this week is another problem that you have to deal with of your spiritual searcher,  Seeker. And he brings this up, and he looks at it, and here's what he says. Let's read it. Ecclesiastes 2.1 to 11.

And then a section just a little later, chapter 3, verses 10 to 14, I'll read them together. So I thought in my heart. Well now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good, but that also proved  to be meaningless. After I said his foolish and what does pleasure accomplish, I tried cheering myself with wine  and embracing folly. My mind still guided me with wisdom.

I wanted to see what was worthwhile for men to do under heaven during the few days of  their lives. I undertook great projects. I built houses for myself and planted vineyards. I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them. I made reservoirs to water grows of flourishing trees.

I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me. I mass silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I acquired men and women's singers and a harem as well, and the delights of the heart  of man. I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me, and all my wisdom, and all this,  my wisdom, stayed with me.

I denied myself nothing, my eyes desired, I refused my heart no pleasure, my heart took  delight in all my work, and this was the reward for all my labor. Yet, when I surveyed all that my hands had done, and what I had toil to achieve, everything  was meaningless, a chasing after the wind, nothing was gained under the sun. I have seen the burden God has laid on men. He has made everything beautiful in its time. He also has set eternity in the hearts of men, yet they cannot fathom what God has done  from beginning to end.

I know that there is nothing better for men than to be happy and to do good while they  live, that everyone may eat and drink and find satisfaction in all his toil. This is the gift of God. I know that everything God does will endure forever. Nothing can be added to it, and nothing taken from it. God does it so that men will revere him.

Now what is the other problem? I said there is a problem of pain, but when you go out looking at life, there is another  problem out there. I know we don't tend to think of it as a problem, but it is, it is a spiritual problem,  same way. See, when you look at evil and suffering, we look at pain. It is a tremendous puzzle we saw last week, but there is pointers to God in it.

However, this week we are looking at the problem of pleasure. Not the problem of pain. You know, I know. If I talk to people about God, what do you think about God? I have a problem with God.

What is that problem? Well, pain, evil and suffering. I don't think I have ever really talked to anybody who said, yeah, I have a watch out  believing in God. Why? Pleasure.

Why is there pleasure in the world? Why is pleasure the way it is? My face is tonight and his face is tonight is it should bother you because pleasure is  a huge problem. For some of you tonight, there is note, and you know who you are, probably already. It is the biggest problem in your life.

Now, maybe you don't know who you are until we get through it, but some of you know  right away. Pleasure is a puzzle. Pleasure is a problem and pleasure has a lot of pointers in it. Now, what he teaches us is three things here, and I am going to put it this way. He teaches us what pleasure, what it promises, what it how it fails, actually, what it promises,  why it fails, and how it points beyond.

Okay? That is basically what he does all the way through in every one of his themes, but what  it promises, why it fails, and how it points beyond, first of all, what it promises. Here in verse 1 to 3, it gives us something that is really very, very intriguing. He says, so I thought in my heart, come now, I will test you with pleasure to find out  what is good. So I tried cheering myself with wine and bracing folly.

I wanted to see what was worthwhile for men to do under heaven during the few days of  their lives. Now, this is important. Look at the word come now. He doesn't go into his project, which is to live for pleasure until now. Well, what happened before?

See, he's coming out of something that he did in chapter 1, and I didn't print it for  you, and we don't have it in front of us, let me read it to you. He's already been through something, and then he turns to pleasure. That's very important to understand what he's saying. In chapter 1, he says, I devoted myself to study and explore by wisdom all that is done  under heaven. But when I saw all things under the sun, I saw all of them are meaningless, a chasing after  the wind, for with much wisdom comes much sorrow and the more knowledge, the more grief.

Now here's what he did. He did not decide at first to live for pleasure. He said, I am going to use my mind and go look at life, and I'm going to figure out what  the meaning of life is and what the purpose of life is and really what life is about and  why things happen that they do. Now, remember, and I read it to you, and we mentioned this last week, he said, I looked  at life to try to understand life under the sun. And the word under the sun, which he throws up again and again in the book of Ecclesiastes,  he tells us, he's looking at life like a practical secular person.

He's looking at life, as John Lennon says, imagine, no heaven, no hell, no eternity, just  this life, living for today. And he says, if that's all we have, we don't know what comes before, we don't know the  after. If that's all we have, he went there to try to figure out what the meaning of life was  and he, what did he decide, what did he determine, what did he conclude? He concluded, if this life all there is, there are no answers to the big questions. If this life is all there is, there's no answers to the big questions, what, what, what  were we here for?

What are we for? What is our purpose? What is right and wrong? What is the absolute moral standard? What is truth?

Where do we go when we die? There are no answers. And that's when he turns to pleasure. Now this is very important. When he looks at life as it is and comes and says there are no answers, and then he turns  to pleasure, he's recapitulating Western history.

First of all, you should know that those of us who live in America, you are living what  we are called Western society, increasingly it's broader than American and Europe because  of technology. But in Western society, we are the first society whose cultural leaders as a whole have said,  there are no answers. I mean, there's never been a society that wasn't built on some kind of religion or philosophy  that said here are the answers. It could have been Buddhist, it could have been shinto, it could be islamic, Christianity,  Judaism, something. But we're really the first one, even, and I would just say, what about communism?

No, sorry, communism also believed. They know the answers, they know where history is going, they know what's what you're supposed  to be doing, they know it, they understand, right? They give the answers. Now, they're all maybe different, you know, they're contradict, they can't all be right. But here's the thing, where the only one who actually says, there are none.

This life is all there is. When you die, that's it, we have no idea why we're here. And we're building a civilization on that. Now what happens when you do that? I'll tell you, let me give you a little vignette, actually we have a little vignette right  here, but let me give you another one.

In radio days, I think that's the name I got. The Woody Allen movie radio days, early on in the beginning of the movie, a boy goes  to class, this will teach you to go to science class now. He goes to class and he hears something and he's just distraught, he's depressed, he's  going crazy. And the mother has to drag him to a counselor and sit them down and the counselor says, what's  going on? And the little boy says, you know, he's about eight or nine years old and I guess he's been  a week or two now since he discovered this, but he says, do you know that the universe is  expanding?

Do you realize that eventually everything's going to burn up? Do you realize everything's going to be over? What's the use of doing anything? Now what does the counselor say? In any other civilization, the counselor would say, that's just not true.

There's plenty of reason. This is not all there is. There's right, there's wrong, there's God, there's eternity, there's, you know what they  would say. But the counselor can't say anything to him because he's right, however he's also crazy. And if you persist in that, in this society, we'll call him crazy, why?

GK Chesterton said, in our society, insanity, insane people are not illogical. In our society, insane people are only logical. In other words, this little boy was saying, I understand finally from school what life's  about. There's no answers. Everything's going to burn up.

Nobody means anything. In the end, it makes no difference what I do. Everything's going to be over. See, he's being logical and that's why it's on the verge of being put away. Because you see, there's nobody out.

There's never been a civilization that had a set of non-answers to the basic questions. Every other society, though, they may be, maybe they're wrong. I mean, for my viewpoint, as a Christian, some of them definitely are wrong. But at least they were there. And therefore, there was no, there was no danger of people going insane by simply logically  taking out what the culture says about the reality.

This little boy is ready to go crazy. So what do they say to him? What do you say to anybody that starts talking like that? Lighting up. Eat an ice cream cone, play a game of ball.

If he was a little older, they say, you know, go out, kiss a girl, have sex, climb a mountain,  look at the view. You know, smell the roses. Come on. Now what are they saying? Now that just sounds like, yeah, yeah, you know what it is.

They're turning to pleasure for what? Look at verse three, for a sense of being worthwhile. The reason in our society, when you don't have anything bigger than yourself to live for,  when you don't know what truth is, when you have no cause worth dying for, you're not  dying for your family, you're not dying for the truth, you're not dying for nation,  you're not dying for God. You know, there is nothing bigger than you, therefore there are no answers to the questions. What do we do?

Since there's no objective meaning, we try to manufacture subjective meaning. Because our wisdom shows us that things are meaningless, therefore we turn to pleasure. But we're not pleasure now becomes very complicated. We expect pleasure. We see a promise here that is much, there's more going on here than pleasure.

In our society, by and large, we are not just going after pleasure. I mean, rats go after pleasure. Rats have sex and it's just about sex. But when we have sex, it's not just the physical experience, also what starts to happen. You start to say, I'm loved, I'm valued, my life is worthwhile.

See, that's what verse three is about. He turned to pleasure, not for pleasure. He turned to pleasure to deal with the fact that he had nothing bigger to live for. And he wasn't looking just for pleasure. He wasn't looking just for sex.

He was looking that he wanted to have that, I know this is on tape. There's a physical orgasm, there's a spiritual orgasm. The physical is a matter of certain chemicals hitting the hypothalamus. But the spiritual is to say, life is worthwhile, my life, there's love. All right, Bernstein says, when he listens to Beethoven's fifth, he doesn't just tap his  feet.

You listen to music, you can't help it. There's a physical thing about music, you listen to music, what is that? What's going on there? Physical, it's neurological. Neurological system is...

You're on the tape, I just made funny, rhythmic, you know, I don't know what the people  on the tape are going to figure what you're laughing at, I was just sort of making funny  rhythmic movements, okay. I'm just trying to be thoughtful. Beethoven says, pardon me, Bernstein says, when I hear Beethoven, I feel that something  is right in the world, something is right in the universe, something checks out, something  that obeys its own laws consistently, something that will never let us down. You know that quote, one of my favorite quotes, but what is he saying? My life is worthwhile, I was reading, back in July, there was a New York Times magazine  article called Lux Populi, not Vox Populi, and it was about the fact that luxury items  are being sold, very expensive luxury items, instead of just being sold to people who live  in just a few rich people someplace, they're being sold everywhere, people are putting out  an incredible amount of money for luxury items, and at one point one of the people who  makes these luxury items was being interviewed and said, they asked, you know, look, okay,  your sweaters are 20 times more expensive than the next sweater, are your sweaters really  20 times better than the next competitor?

And what does he say? He said, we sell dreams, he explained, when you see one of our boutiques and you go in  and you buy lipstick or you buy this or that, it has the dream in it, now what is he saying? What a nice euphemistic way of putting it, but he's right, there's something more than  pleasure going on here, there's something more than the feel of probably, you know, his  sweaters probably are incredibly comfortable, but there's something much different, just  like it's sex is not about sex now, and music is not about music, what he's really saying  is you buy that sweater so you know, my life is worthwhile, you're manufacturing subjective  meaning, but let us be clear what's going on. In a society that has no objective meaning, there is going to be a kind of freneticness  about pleasure, and really, I'm not sure we can ever say that there has ever been a society,  I mean society has always had its pleasures, but has there ever been a society that puts  the metabolism and entertainment into sexual activity, into material, you know, luxuries  that we do, there's never been one, maybe the Greco-Roman world as it was beginning to  fall apart, but that's also because just like the Ecclesiastes guy says here, it was because  they had lost their ability to believe in any objective meaning, and so they had  to turn, and therefore they turned to pleasure, not just for pleasure, but a sense of worth  wildness. Now, before I move on, you understand, let me apply this to you personally, what does  it mean to live a life of pleasure?

A lot of you don't think you're doing it, because you see, one of the things here is in  the very beginning and it says, laughter is foolish, see verse two, and what's this pleasure  accomplished. After in pleasure, two Hebrew words, they're not really synonyms. Laughter really means a kind of orgy. Laughter means to lose your discernment, whereas pleasure, the second word, has more  of a sense of refinement aesthetics, and you see, one is a whole heart, full-throated  party in orgy, the other is refinement. One is get smashed, the other one is buy art, but let me tell you,  he is saying, they are the same, they are the same.

You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger  brother. In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who  try to earn his love by being good. In his book The prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart  of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental  older brother, and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal, extravagant grace. Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith, the prodigal God will help  you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way. The prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel in life share  the hope, enjoy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the world.

When it comes right down to it, I don't know whether you are having a lot of sex or whether  you just have a job that you hate because it's not doing anything productive for anybody  but it's making enough money so that someday you'll be able to do the things you want  to do. That's the same thing as a person who's partying all the time. You see there's a downtown and the uptown approach to hedonism but you see there's  Oprah Winfrey and there's Jerry Springer but it's the same. What is the bottom line in your life?

Do you have anything worth dying for? Do you have anything that you'd go to the mat for? Is there any truth that this is the bottom line? So really is it comfort, affluence? Is it good feeling?

Is it sensory pleasure? If you do that, you're not doing it just for pleasure. You're looking to get a life. You're looking to get a sense of worth wellness and it's going to fail. That's the second point.

The first point is what it promises, the second point he gives us and shows us is it  fails and it explains why. Now, one of the things it's important to understand and boy, this is very powerful. This is not a regular guy. No, it isn't. First 10, I denied myself nothing, my eyes desired.

Now what's that? I denied myself nothing, my eyes desired. Now there's only 99.99% of people cannot say that. All of us deny ourselves all sorts of things our eyes desire, mainly because we don't  have the money or the power to take them. And because of that, most of us are going down this path and pleasure is our bottom line  and it is the main thing we're living for, even though by and large, unless we're party  hearty types, we kind of really, really hide that from ourselves.

I'm trying to reveal this to some of you here tonight. But he said, if you're going down that path and you're empty, instead of saying there's  something wrong with the path, we have a tendency to say it's because I haven't gone  far enough. If I could build that house in the lake, if I could have a better love life, if I could  just lose weight, in other words, because you haven't gone far enough down, that's the  reason why you feel like you're empty. You're blaming yourself when it's the path. And what's so very powerful about this, when he is depicting himself as the greatest,  the greatest, one of the 0.001% who actually was able to do anything he wanted to satisfy  any sensory pleasure.

Now somebody says, well, how do I know that really happened? You kind of made me wonder, is this person really a king or was he taken the role of a  king? It doesn't matter. Here's what he's trying to say. I challenge you.

Look at the lives of the people who are in that 0.001%. Read their biographies, read their interviews. They found exactly what he has. They're just not, the reason they're so unhappy and the reason they're so jevastated is  they're not living in the avail of illusion that we are, because they got to the end of  the road and there was a dead end. And we're empty, but we say, well, if I only got further down, well, they got down there.

That's the reason why they're so unhappy. They're not happy because they're rich. They're unhappy because they got to the end of the road. And they saw, they were still just them. It's a powerful argument for the fact that pleasure ultimately fails us.

Not that it fails to deliver the orgasm. Not that it fails to deliver the neurological rhythm. Not that it fails to deliver the comfort of the nice sweater, but it fails to deliver  worth-wildness. It fails to give you what you're really looking for in that is transcendence. We are looking for a way to do an in-run around the fact we have nothing to live for.

We have nothing solid. We have nothing we're sure of. We have nothing that's going to take us to the stars. We have nothing that we think will last past us, to see. We're looking for transcendence, and it will fail at that.

Utterly fail. In two ways, number one, pleasure will fail to distract you. In verse three, he says, my mind was still guided you with wisdom. He said, I tried cheering myself with wine and bracing folly, but my mind was still guiding  me. Down in verse nine, he says, I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem.

In all this, my wisdom stayed with me. What is that? What's he talking about? I'll tell you what he's talking about. This is one of my, as some of you know, one of my favorite quotes from C.S.

Lewis. What he's trying to say is, no matter how hard I tried, through pleasure to forget the  fact that I had nothing to live for and nothing means anything, I tried and it broke through. Pleasure. See, subjective pleasure, trying to talk to wipe out the lack of objective pleasure is  like trying to butter too much bread with too little butter. You know, you spread it and by the time the knife gets to the end, there's no butter there.

I mean, it wasn't enough butter, it just sunk in. And in the same way, subjective pleasure fails because no matter how hard he tried to  stop thinking, his wisdom stayed with and the truth kept coming through, you know. If your life, if your origin is an accident and your destiny is just rot, if your life,  if your origin is insignificant and your destiny is insignificant, have the guts to admit  your life is insignificant. Well, now that thought, we try to keep away, but is what Lewis says. He says, let us suppose that nature is all that exists.

This meaningless play of atoms and space in time by a series of a hundred chances has  regrettably produced things like ourselves, conscious beings who now know that their own  consciousness is an accidental result of the whole meaningless process and is therefore  self-meaningless, though to us, alas, we feel significant. In this situation, you might decide to simply have as good time as possible, right? Say, hey, life is meaningless. Let's have a great time. Why not?

What difference does it make? I might as well have these great feelings. You might decide to have as good a time as possible, but you can't accept it now, listen. You can't accept in the lowest animal sense. Maybe in love with a girl if you know and you remember that your view of the world means  that all the beauties of her person and her character are a momentary and accidental  pattern produced by the collision of atoms and your own response to them is only a sort  of psychic chemical phosphorescence, arising from the behavior of your genetic material, and  you can't go on getting very serious pleasure for music if you know and remember that its  air significance is a pure illusion that you like it only because your nervous system  is irrationally conditioned to like it.

Yes, you may still in the lowest sense of a good time, but just in so far as it becomes  very good, just in so far as it ever threatens to push you from cold sensuality on into real  warmth and real enthusiasm and real joy, so far will you be forced to feel the hopeless  disharmony between your own emotions and the universe in which you think you really  live. It will break through. As time goes on, even if it's unconscious or semi-conscious, the fact that you've got  nothing to live for, the wisdom breaks through. It creates a grimness, it creates a joylessness no matter how much pleasure you try to take,  but not only does pleasure fail to distract us from the lack of objective reality, but  secondly, it fails to satisfy. Because down in verse 11, at the climax, he says, I looked at it all and everything was  meaningless, a chasing after the wind, that was chasing after the wind.

Wind is something you can't keep. Wind can be a wonderful experience, but you can't keep it, you can't say, ah, let me grab  that thing so I can have that wind tomorrow, it can't be done. Now on the physical and spiritual level, see, here's what's frightening, I said, that  especially in our society, what's really going on when we seek pleasure is we're not after  just the physical sensory pleasure, we're after transcendence, we're after worth  wildness. Well, first of all, one of the most awful things to know, and addiction counselors will  tell you this, is that pleasurable agents, at first give you a rush, but then there's  a tolerance factor, pleasurable agents at, you know, A amount, you know, five liters  of such a pleasurable agent will give you a great, great experience the first time,  but the next time it'll take a little more to get the same amount of experience, the  same amount of pleasure. And next time a little bit more, next time a little bit more because we adapt and pleasurable  agents wear off in their ability to create pleasure.

And that's how addictions happen. You need more and you need more and you need more and if you're lucky, you can break it  off before it completely destroys you and then you just be empty. And that's physical pleasure, physical pleasure is like the wind, it just doesn't stay. If you give it, if you really rely on it, not if you enjoy it, but if you just rely on  it, if you go to it for transcendence, especially it cannot deliver. And Lewis, of course, has some classic stuff about the fact that it's not just physically  the pleasure we can't hold on to, but spiritually it disappoints us in this way.

He says in one of his more famous quotes, he says, all of your life, there's been an unattainable  ecstasy that's hovered just beyond the grasp of your consciousness. The loft on the verge of breaking through, you know, when you're in a boat or when you're  falling in love, you know, when he says, he says, when you're starting into a pleasurable  experience, you think, ah, finally, I'll be worth this is it, somehow this is it. He says off on the verge of breaking through and yet you've never had it. All the things that have ever deeply possessed you, your soul, have been but hints of it,  tantalizing glimpses, promises never quite fulfilled, echoes that died away just as they  were caught year-year. It's the secret signature of each soul.

With the incomunicable and unappeasable want, the thing we desire before we met our wives  or made our friends or chose our work and which we shall still desire on our deathbeds  when the mind is no longer knowing wife or friend or work. The books of the music in which we thought the beauty was located will betray us if we  trust in them. It was not in them, it only comes through them. If they are mistaken for the thing itself, they turn into dumb idols, breaking the hearts  of their worshipers. For they are not the thing itself, they are only the scent of the flower we have not found,  the echo of a tune we have not heard, news from a country we have never yet visited.

It gets a music we are born remembering. There's a music we're born remembering, we're trying to hear in music. There's a scent we're born remembering, we're trying to smell in the flower. Now, what is that? I believe that even though how do you prove it, I can prove it just by saying it.

We know that this is true, that that sense of transcendence does not come through. As he said, the best marriage is the best career is the best houses, in fact, people who  get to the very end of the road find it hasn't got their other ones that know the best. Those of us who don't have these wonderful pleasures, we're still in the avail of illusion  we think, if only, no. Well, why would this be? Why isn't pleasure enough?

Why do we want to go beyond? Well, here's the pointer in chapter three. It says, and there's a lot more in chapter three, but we just can't go into it all tonight. He says, he has made everything beautiful in his time. He has also said eternity in the hearts of men yet they cannot fathom what God has done  from beginning to end.

Now that's something pretty interesting. Take a look at this. First of all, he says there's all sorts of beautiful things out there. In fact, if you want to know the definition of a pleasure, it's beauty. Do you want to know the definition of beauty?

A beauty is something. Something is beautiful rather than instrumental. Something is beautiful if it's pleasurable in itself, just for itself. You see, if you studied art because you had to get an A in a class, and then as soon as  the class was over, you never went to see art. Art is fine.

Okay. It's just instrumental. It's not beautiful. But if afterwards you would go when you didn't have to, when it doesn't get you anywhere  as a matter of fact, it costs you money. You see, something is beautiful rather than instrumental.

Something is beautiful when it gives you pleasure just because of your delight in it, just  to see it, just to let it be there, just to put it on your eyes, on your tongue, on your  ear, on your heart. That's what something is. It's beautiful. But we have seen that there's something wrong because the beautiful things that we set  our hearts on, addict us, and yet at the same time, they don't satisfy us. Why?

Well, it's the second clause. He has put eternity in the hearts of men. That's almost a unique verse in the Bible. He has put endlessness in our hearts. What that means is that there is a desire for an eternal beauty, and that all the beauties  that are here, if we set our hearts on them, as Lewis said, they disappoint us because  they are only the scent of the flower we haven't smelled.

They're only the hint, the echo of a tune we haven't really heard. You know, if there's a music we're born remembering, well, what is it? Well, in general, it's the face of God. Psalm 16, verse 11, in thy face is fullness of joy in thy right hand, their pleasures  for evermore. Psalm 27, verse 4.

One thing, that's an addict. One thing do I seek after. One thing do I ask for to gaze on the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple. Now, in general, this is a challenge to everybody. If this is true, a lot of people are in trouble.

A lot of you have said, I believe in God, fine, why? Can I ask you why? I believe in God. Why? Okay.

Well, what do you do about it? Well, I go to church, or I obey to think commandments. Why? Because I ought to. Why?

Let me keep pushing you. In the end, there's only two, see Christians, real Christians whose lives have been changed,  and whose attitude toward pleasures is so different because we can enjoy them. We're not afraid of them now, but on the other hand, they are not the main thing, so they  don't addict us either. The difference between a Christian whose life has really been changed, and a religious  person is this, religious people find God useful, instrumental, and Christians are people  who have finally found them beautiful, who obey Him just because of who He is. Wouldn't care what else it brought them, just for the delight.

You see, religious people and Christians, they share obedience, religious people and Christians  may be desperate for God. They might be obedient to God, so they may have all sorts of awe and reverence to God,  but the difference between a Christian and just a religious person and a nice person  is that they find them useful, but Christians find them beautiful, that you come after Him  and you seek Him and you obey Him because of the beauty of who He is. Has that been true of you? Have you experienced that? That's what real Christianity is.

Well, somebody says, wow, how, how could that happen? Here's the answer. Jesus Christ, can I tell you what the gospel is? The Bible actually gives you the gospel in terms of beauty. We, because of our sin, have made the world ugly.

We've made our souls ugly. We've made the world ugly. How are we going to be saved from our sin? We're told in Isaiah chapter 53, the servant came from heaven and he came to earth and we're  told this about him. He had, this is, this is Isaiah 53, he had no beauty that we should desire him.

Jesus Christ lost his beauty. Jesus Christ became ugly. Jesus Christ became shriveled. Jesus Christ lost his glory and he lost his beauty. Why?

That's the first half. Because of our sin and what did he do when he died on the cross? He died on the cross in our place so that when we believe in him, what are we told? In Colossians chapter 1, verse 22, there it tells us so that now when we believe in  God, with Jesus, God looks at us and he sees us wholly and spotless without blemish. Listen, religion says, obey God or he'll get you.

The gospel said you've made the world ugly and yourself ugly. Jesus Christ came and lost his beauty so that now when you believe in him, you don't  just now, you know, you know, that doesn't just make you a better person in some way. You're beautiful in God's sight. You are in a sheer beauty to him because he lost his beauty so you could get it. Now, if I tell you obey God or he'll get you, you'll have to treat him as instrumental  and frankly, every religion essentially tells you that.

But the gospel says, no, look at what he's done for you. That's beautiful. Do you believe you're a sinner? Do you believe you're lost? Now a lot of you wouldn't.

I mean, you live in New York. A lot of you wouldn't. Do you know what that means? Until you see that, you'll never find them beautiful. You'll only find them instrumental and you'll never have the things in your heart that are  addicting you thrown out for a greater beauty.

Your heart needs an object of beauty. You can't get rid of the ones that are holding on to you just by trying to throw them out. They have to be displaced by a higher beauty, a greater beauty, and this is it. You'll never find him beautiful. If you just say he's very big and he's very big and I better obey him because he'll crush  me.

Now, why don't we get beauty that way? But only if you see that you're a sinner and you see what he's done. That's how you become a Christian, seeing the beauty of the Lord. But now, some of you are Christians and you know what you're saying? You're saying, I am a Christian, but I'm addicted to something.

All right? That's because you're not gazing on his beauty. You're not gazing. Well, you say, how do I gaze on this beauty? Well, it'd really be another sermon, however.

Just let me just tell you three things. First of all, you have to get to know Jesus, not God in general, Jesus. Jesus became a human being. He became a sensory person, a human being. He entered into our sensory environment because we can have this kind of intimacy with him  so he can really be a beauty to us.

I have to read about him. You have to get to know everything you can about him, everything. That's first. Then secondly, prayer is very deep. First thing is, get to know Jesus.

Secondly, don't think prayer is easy or simple. If you want to make him a professional baseball player, it's going to take a long time. You can't just get out there. Here's a bat. Here's a ball.

I throw up in the air. I hit the ball. I'm going to go show up. It's Shay Stadium. Hey, I understand you're in a wild car race.

Do you need somebody? It takes years and years and years. And prayer is a lot harder than that. You haven't even begun to figure out the depths of prayer. You haven't begun to look at praise.

You haven't begun to see what happens through repentance. Beauty happens. You see the beauty of his majesty. You see the beauty of his symmetry. You see the beauty of his fragility, of his weakness.

You just see it. It comes in prayer. But thirdly, you need the Holy Spirit because you know an artwork needs a light. Every art gallery has lights. And Jesus Christ is nothing without Holy Spirit.

But Jesus says, when the Spirit comes, he will glorify me. He will take of mine and he will glorify me. Ask the Spirit, learn to pray, look at Jesus, and know that real thing that your heart  needs to overcome your addictions is not just a general knowledge of who he is in trying  harder, but an experience of his beauty.

在今天的播客里，提姆·凯勒会看《传道书》如何帮助我们面对自己的疑惑、恐惧和不确定，并把我们引向在基督里那持久的盼望与意义。《传道书》这卷书非常、非常难，我其实是在讲解它，尽量给大家一个整体的概览。我想如果有人说，“哦，这太棒了，你只要读一遍就懂了”，你读完多半会说：“这东西怎么会在圣经里？”

我们上周说过，之所以如此难读，其中有一个原因（当然原因不止一个，我每次都不可能全讲完）。我在这里不是要给你做《传道书》的通览，而是要抽取一些我认为与我们今天相关的基本主题。《传道书》是圣经中唯一一卷从怀疑者视角写成的书：一个在没有上帝的前提下看人生的人，一个寻求真理、却并不站在信徒位置上的人。

另外一个让它更难读的原因，是因为在开头、结尾，以及中间几处地方，作者似乎会从疑惑中“抽身出来”，开始发表评论。我先把我的理解摊开讲：据我所知，这是一个作品——一件极其精彩的艺术作品——同时这在旧约时代、古代以及那片文化里也很常见。一个人要表达某个观点，会采取一种“角色扮演”的方式。

在开头和结尾，作者用第三人称谈到《传道书》的作者——这位“传道者”、这位“教师”、这位评论者——他用第三人称谈论他；然后在第一章第12节，他突然转为第一人称，说：“我——传道者——我做了这个，我做了那个，我又做了那个”；到了最后，他又退出来说：“我们学到了什么？”

因为他所做的，是：他本是一个相信的人，一个信上帝的人，但他进入一个角色，去探索一个“寻找者”的处境——去探索他的疑惑、怀疑和艰难。这也是为什么，若你不理解这一点，有时就很难解释经文；但另一方面，这也正是它如此切合当下的原因之一。

1997年12月，《纽约时报杂志》做过一期整刊专题，标题叫《上帝被去中心化》（God Decentralized），主文副标题是：“甚至没有信仰的人也在寻找上帝。”当主流报纸和杂志——由我们都知道总体上比大众更少宗教倾向的编辑、经理和记者所写所做的媒体——开始用整期篇幅来谈“宗教寻求与宗教寻找的复兴”，那就说明这事一定是真的：一定正在发生。

我同意他们，也同意那一期专题的判断：还没有出现“宗教上的找到”。还没有出现“属灵上的找到”。全国的教会和会堂并没有翻倍增长——那才叫复兴。但确实出现了一个巨大的“宗教寻找”的复兴：也许还没有找到，但寻找是绝对在发生的。而《传道书》是唯一一卷从“寻找者”视角写成的书。

当你踏上属灵的寻找之旅时，人总会撞上一些东西。

上周我们看了其中一个，《传道书》的作者谈到的，就是“痛苦”。我们如何面对痛苦？如何面对痛苦的问题？有一本书就叫《痛苦的问题》（The Problem of Pain）。事实上，几乎有无数本书都在谈“痛苦的问题”。

我们如何面对世界上的邪恶、受苦与不公？

但这周我们要看的是你在属灵寻找中必须面对的另一个问题，寻找者、寻求者必须处理的另一个问题。他把它提出来，去审视它，他这样说。我们来读。《传道书》2:1-11。

然后还有稍后的一段，第三章10-14节。我把它们连在一起读。

“我心里说：‘来吧，我要用享乐试验你，好知道什么是好；’谁知这也是虚空。我指嬉笑说：‘这是狂妄。’论喜乐说：‘有何功效呢？’我心里察究，如何用酒使我肉体舒畅，我心却仍以智慧引导我；又如何持住愚昧，等我看明世人，在天下一生当行何事为美。我为自己动大工程：建造房屋，栽种葡萄园；修造园囿，在其中栽种各样果木树；挖造水池，用以浇灌嫩小的树木。我买了仆婢，也有生在家中的仆婢；又有许多牛群羊群，胜过以前在耶路撒冷众人所有的。我又为自己积蓄金银和君王的财宝，并各省的财宝；又得唱歌的男女和世人所喜爱的妃嫔。这样，我就日见昌盛，胜过以前在耶路撒冷的众人。我的智慧仍然存留。凡我眼所求的，我没有留下不给它；我心所乐的，我没有禁止不享受；因我的心为我一切劳碌快乐，这就是我从劳碌中所得的分。后来我察看我手所经营的一切事和我劳碌所成的功，谁知都是虚空，都是捕风，在日光之下毫无益处。”

“我见上帝叫世人劳苦，使他们在其中受经练。他造万物，各按其时成为美好，又将永生（永恒）安置在世人心里；然而上帝从始至终的作为，人不能参透。我知道世人莫强如终身喜乐行善；并且人人吃喝，在他一切劳碌中享福，这也是上帝的恩赐。我知道上帝一切所做的都必永存；无所增添，无所减少；上帝这样行，是要人在他面前存敬畏的心。”

那么，另一个问题是什么？我说过有“痛苦的问题”，但当你出去观察人生时，还有另一个问题在那里。我知道我们通常不会把它当作“问题”，但它确实是——同样是属灵的问题。

你看，当我们面对邪恶与受苦时，我们看到的是痛苦。上周我们说过，这是一道巨大的难题，但其中也有指向上帝的线索。

然而这周，我们要看的不是“痛苦的问题”，而是“快乐（享乐）的问题”。

你知道，我知道：如果我跟人谈上帝，“你怎么看上帝？”有人会说：“我对上帝有个问题。”

“什么问题？”

“痛苦，邪恶与受苦。”

我几乎从没遇到过有人说：“是的，我信上帝最大的障碍是——快乐。”

“为什么世界上会有快乐？为什么快乐是这样的？”

可今晚我面对你、我对你说：这应该让你不安，因为快乐是个巨大的问题。对你们当中的一些人来说——你知道你是谁，也许你现在就知道——这就是你生命里最大的难题。

也许你得等我们讲完才会知道，但有些人一开始就知道：快乐是个谜。快乐是个问题，而快乐里面也有许多指向更深处的线索。

他在这里教我们三件事，我这样概括：他教我们快乐“应许了什么”、它“为何失败”、以及它“如何指向更远”。可以吗？基本上他处理每个主题都是这样：它应许什么，它为何失败，它如何指向更远。

第一，快乐应许了什么。

在第1到第3节，这里有个很耐人寻味的东西。他说：“我心里说：来吧，我要用享乐试验你，好知道什么是好……我就用酒使自己欢畅，又持住愚昧；我心却仍以智慧引导我。我想看看世人，在天下一生的日子不多，当做什么为美。”

这很重要。注意“来吧”（come now）这个词。他直到这里才开始他的计划——为快乐而活。那之前发生了什么？

他是从第一章的某件事里走出来，然后转向快乐。理解他在说什么，这一点非常关键。

在第一章他说：“我专心用智慧寻求、查究天下所做的一切事。”但当他在日光之下察看万事，他说万事都是虚空、都是捕风；“因为多有智慧就多有愁烦，加增知识就加增忧伤。”

他做了什么？他起初并没有决定为快乐而活。他说：“我要用我的头脑去看人生；我要弄明白生命的意义、生命的目的、生命到底是什么、为什么事情会这样发生。”

请记得（我读给你听的、上周也提过的），他说他要理解“日光之下”的人生。“日光之下”这个词在《传道书》中反复出现，他告诉我们：他是在用一个务实的世俗之人的方式来看人生。

他像约翰·列侬唱的那样看人生：“想象一下，没有天堂，没有地狱，没有永恒，只有今生——为今天而活。”他说：如果我们只有这些，我们不知道之前是什么，我们不知道之后是什么；如果我们只有这些——他就走进那里，想弄清生命的意义——他最后得出了什么结论？

他结论是：如果人生就只有这一生，那么大问题没有答案。如果人生就只有这一生，大问题就没有答案：我们为何在这里？我们为何而活？我们的目的是什么？什么是对与错？绝对的道德标准在哪里？什么是真理？我们死后去哪里？没有答案。

就在那一刻，他转向快乐。

这点非常重要。他这样看人生，说没有答案，然后转向快乐，他其实是在重演西方历史。

首先，你要知道：住在美国的人（其实也越来越不限于美国与欧洲，因为科技的缘故），我们活在所谓“西方社会”里。在西方社会，我们是第一个整体而言由文化领袖宣称“没有答案”的社会。我的意思是：从来没有一个社会不是建立在某种宗教或哲学之上，并且那宗教或哲学说：“答案在这里。”可能是佛教、神道教、伊斯兰教、基督教、犹太教，或别的什么。

你也许会说：“那共产主义呢？”不，抱歉。共产主义也相信自己“知道答案”：他们知道历史往哪里去，他们知道你该做什么，他们知道所谓“真相”，他们给出答案。当然，答案彼此不同，也许互相矛盾，不可能都对。但关键是：只有我们这个文明真正说，“没有答案”。

“人生就只有这一生。死了就结束。我们不知道为什么在这里。”

我们竟然要在这个基础上建造一个文明。

那么会发生什么？我告诉你。我给你一个小片段——其实这里就有一个——但我再给你一个。

在广播时代（我想那部片子就叫这个名字），伍迪·艾伦的电影《广播时代》（Radio Days）里，影片开头不久，有个男孩去上课——这可教训你以后还敢去上科学课。那孩子在课堂上听到一件事，结果整个人崩溃：心烦意乱、沮丧、快要发疯。他母亲只好把他拖去见心理辅导员，坐下后辅导员问：“怎么了？”

小男孩说（他大概八九岁，我猜他发现这件事已经一两周了）：“你知道宇宙正在膨胀吗？你知道最终一切都会烧尽吗？你知道最后一切都会结束吗？那做任何事有什么用？”

辅导员怎么回答？在任何别的文明里，辅导员会说：“那不是真的。人生有充分的理由。这不是全部。还有对与错，还有上帝，还有永恒……”他们会这么说。

但这个辅导员不能这么说，因为孩子说得“对”——但他也快疯了。

而如果你在这个社会坚持那种逻辑，我们会说他“疯了”。为什么？

G.K.切斯特顿说：在我们的社会里，精神失常的人并不是不合逻辑；在我们的社会里，精神失常的人只是“过于合逻辑”。换句话说，这个小男孩是在说：“我终于从学校明白了人生是什么：没有答案。一切都会烧尽。没人真正有意义。最后我做什么都没差，一切都会结束。”

你看，他是合逻辑的，因此他几乎要被“收起来”（送去治疗）了。因为从来没有一个文明在基本问题上给出一整套“非答案”。别的社会，即便可能错了——以我作为基督徒的立场，其中有些确实是错的——至少他们给了答案。因此，人们不会因为纯粹把文化对现实的说法逻辑推到底，就面临发疯的危险。

这个小男孩快疯了。那他们对他说什么？你会对任何开始这么讲话的人说什么？“振作点！吃个冰淇淋，打场球。”

如果他大一点，他们会说：“出去吧，亲吻一个女孩，发生性关系，爬座山，看看风景。闻闻玫瑰花。来吧。”

他们在说什么？这听起来像“对对对”，但你知道那是什么。

他们是在转向快乐，为了什么？看第3节——为了获得一种“值得感”。在一个没有任何比自己更大的东西可以为之而活的社会里，当你不知道真理是什么，当你没有任何值得为之死的事业——你不会为家人而死，不会为真理而死，不会为国家而死，不会为上帝而死——当没有任何比你更大的东西时，大问题就没有答案。

那我们怎么办？

既然没有客观意义，我们就试着制造主观意义。我们的智慧告诉我们万事虚空，于是我们转向快乐。

可这时“快乐”变得复杂了。我们期待快乐，但这里的应许远不止“快乐本身”。

在我们的社会里，大体上，我们追求的并不只是快乐。老鼠也追求快乐。老鼠发生性行为就只是性。但当我们发生性行为时，它不只是身体经验，还发生什么？你开始说：“我是被爱的，我是被看重的，我的生命是值得的。”

你看，第3节就在讲这个。他转向快乐，不是为快乐而转向快乐；他转向快乐，是为了处理“没有比自己更大的东西可为之而活”的事实。他找的不只是快乐，他找的不只是性。

他在寻找的是——我知道这段录音会留下来——有身体的高潮，也有属灵的高潮。身体的高潮，是某些化学物质刺激下丘脑；属灵的高潮，是在说：“生命是值得的；我的生命是值得的；这里有爱。”

伯恩斯坦说，他听贝多芬第五交响曲时，不只是打拍子。你听音乐，你很难不被它带动。音乐有一种身体性的东西——那是什么？发生了什么？一方面是生理的，是神经系统的反应。

（录音里你们听不到，我刚才做了些滑稽的、节奏性的动作。我不知道录音里的人会明白你们在笑什么，我就是做了些动作而已。）

贝多芬——抱歉，是伯恩斯坦——说：“当我听贝多芬时，我觉得宇宙中有某些东西是对的；世界里有某些东西是对的；有某些东西合乎其自身的规律，始终如一，永不叫我们失望。”你知道那句名言，我最喜欢的名言之一。

他在说什么？“我的生命是值得的。”

我记得去年七月我读过一篇《纽约时报杂志》的文章，标题叫《Lux Populi》（不是 Vox Populi），讲的是奢侈品正在被出售：非常昂贵的奢侈品不再只是卖给少数富人，而是到处在卖。人们在奢侈品上花出惊人的钱。

其中一位奢侈品牌的制造者接受采访，记者问：“你看，你的毛衣比别家的贵20倍，你的毛衣真的比竞争者好20倍吗？”

他怎么回答？他说：“我们卖的是梦想。”他解释说：当你看到我们的精品店，你走进去买口红或买这个买那个，里面带着一个梦想。

这是什么？这是一种很优雅的说法，但他是对的：这里发生的不只是快乐。就像性不再只是性，音乐不再只是音乐。

他其实是在说：你买那件毛衣，是为了知道“我的生命是值得的”——你在制造主观意义。

但我们要清楚：在一个没有客观意义的社会里，快乐会带上一种狂躁的、停不下来的特质。社会从来都有娱乐与享受，但有没有一个社会像我们这样，把如此高的代谢率与娱乐强度投入到性、物质奢华上？几乎没有。也许古希腊罗马世界在衰败前夕有点像，但那也是因为——正如《传道书》这里所说——他们失去了对客观意义的信心，于是只能转向快乐。

因此他们转向快乐，并非只是为快乐，而是为了获得一种“值得感”。

在我继续之前，你明白吗？应用到你个人：什么叫“以快乐为生”？

很多人不觉得自己在这么做。因为这里一开始就说：“我指嬉笑说：这是狂妄”（第2节），并且说“这喜乐（享乐）有何功效？”在希伯来文里，“嬉笑”和“喜乐/享乐”这两个词并非同义。

“嬉笑”更像一种放纵的狂欢，是失去分辨力；而“享乐/喜乐”更像精致、审美、品味。

一个是放开嗓子、尽情派对甚至纵欲；另一个是精致与修养。

一个是喝到烂醉；另一个是买艺术品。

但让我告诉你：他在说，它们是一样的，是一样的。

你可能知道浪子回头的故事，但那不只是关于一个叛逆的小儿子。事实上，耶稣讲这个故事，同时是对两类人说的：一类是远离上帝的人；另一类是试图靠“做好人”来赢得上帝之爱的人。

在《浪子的上帝》（The Prodigal God）一书中，提姆·凯勒展示了这个家喻户晓的故事如何揭示福音的核心——既给悖逆的小儿子，也给论断人的大儿子带来盼望，并邀请所有人经历上帝那慷慨、奢华的恩典。

无论你是基督徒，还是仍在探索信仰，《浪子的上帝》都能帮助你用全新的眼光看你与基督的关系。

《浪子的上帝》是我们为感谢你本月的奉献而赠送的礼物；你的奉献帮助“福音与生命”（Gospel in Life）把基督恩典而执着的爱所带来的盼望与喜乐，分享给世界各地的人。

说到底，我不知道你是拥有很多性，还是你只是做着一份你讨厌的工作——那工作对任何人都没有真正的益处——却能赚到足够多的钱，好让你有一天能做你想做的事。那其实和一个整天派对的人是同一回事。

你看，有一种“市中心式”和“上城式”的享乐主义；有奥普拉·温弗瑞，也有杰瑞·斯普林格（Jerry Springer），但本质一样。

你人生的底线是什么？你有没有任何值得为之死的东西？有没有任何你愿意拼到最后的东西？有没有任何真理是你人生的底线？所以，最终真的是舒适、富足吗？是让自己感觉良好吗？是感官的快乐吗？

如果你这样做，你并不是只为了快乐。你是在寻找“一个人生”。你是在寻找一种“值得感”，而它必然失败。这就是第二点。

第一点是它应许什么；第二点他给我们展示并解释的是：它会失败，以及为什么。

有一点很重要，而且非常有力：这不是普通人。不是。第10节：“凡我眼所求的，我没有留下不给它。”这句话什么意思？能说这句话的人只占99.99%之外的极少数。我们每个人都会拒绝自己眼所想要的许多东西，主要原因是我们没有钱、也没有权去得到它们。

因此，我们大多数人其实正走在这条路上：快乐是我们的底线，是我们活着的主要目标——只是我们通常会把这一点对自己隐藏起来（除非你是那种“派对型”）。

我今晚想把这件事揭露给你们当中的一些人。

可你看：如果你走在这条路上却感到空虚，你往往不会说“路错了”，而会说：“是因为我还走得不够远。”

“如果我能在湖边盖一栋房子；如果我的爱情生活更好；如果我能减肥……”换句话说，你觉得你之所以空虚，是因为你还没走得足够深；你在责备自己，而不是责备那条路。

最有力的地方在于：他把自己描绘为“最伟大的那类人”——那0.001%里的人——一个真的能够为所欲为、满足任何感官欲望的人。

有人会说：“那我怎么知道这事真的发生过？你让我怀疑：这个人真的是君王，还是他只是扮演君王？”

不重要。他要表达的是：我挑战你——去看那些0.001%的人生。读他们的传记，读他们的访谈。他们发现的正是他所说的。他们之所以不快乐、之所以被摧毁，是因为他们不再活在我们这种“幻觉的面纱”里：他们走到了路的尽头，发现那里是死胡同。

我们也空虚，但我们说：“如果我再往前一点就好了。”而他们已经到了。

这就是他们如此不快乐的原因。

他们不快乐不是因为他们富有；他们不快乐是因为他们到了路的尽头，却发现自己仍然只是自己。

这是一个非常有力的论证：快乐最终会让我们失望。不是说它不能带来身体高潮；不是说它不能带来神经系统的节律感；不是说它不能带来那件好毛衣的舒适；而是：它不能带来“值得感”。它不能给你你真正想要的东西——也就是超越性（transcendence）。

我们是在寻找一种绕过“我没有可为之而活之物”的事实的方法。我们没有坚固之物；没有确信之物；没有能把我们带向群星之物；没有我们相信会在我们之后仍然存留之物。

我们在寻找超越性，而快乐在这方面会失败。

彻底失败。

它以两种方式失败。

第一，快乐无法真正分散你的注意力。

第3节他说：“我心却仍以智慧引导我。”他说：“我试着用酒使自己欢畅，持住愚昧，但我的心仍在引导我。”第9节他说：“我日见昌盛……在这一切事上，我的智慧仍然存留。”

这是什么？他在说什么？我告诉你他在说什么。

这是我最喜欢的、C.S.路易斯的一段话。他要说的是：无论我多么努力想借着快乐忘记“我没有可为之而活之物、万事无意义”，那真相仍会穿透出来。

主观的快乐，想要抹去客观意义的缺席，就像用太少的黄油去抹太多的面包。你一抹，等刀抹到最后就没有黄油了。黄油不够，它都被吸收掉了。

同样，主观的快乐会失败：不管他多努力地不去想，他的“智慧”仍然与他同在，真相仍会穿透出来。

如果你的起源只是偶然，你的归宿只是腐烂；如果你的起源无足轻重、你的归宿也无足轻重——那就有胆量承认：你的生命也无足轻重。

我们试图把这个念头挡在外面，但路易斯说：

“让我们假设自然就是一切存在。原子在时空中毫无意义地玩耍，在无数偶然中不幸产生了像我们这样的东西：有意识的存在。如今我们知道，我们的意识是整个毫无意义过程的偶然结果，因此意识本身也就自我无意义；但我们却又（唉）感觉自己很重要。

在这种处境下，你也许决定：那就尽可能享受吧。对吧？说：‘人生无意义，那就好好玩一把。为什么不？反正有什么差别？我不如尽量拥有这些美妙的感受。’

你也许决定尽可能享乐，但你不能——请听——你不能用最低等、动物式的方式以外的方式来接受它。

你也许会爱上一个女孩，但如果你知道、并记得你的世界观意味着：她的人格之美与品格之美，只不过是原子碰撞所产生的一种短暂、偶然的图案，而你对它的回应也只是一种心理化学的磷光——源于你遗传物质的行为——你就无法继续。

如果你知道并记得：音乐的所谓意义不过是纯粹的幻觉，你之所以喜欢它，只因为你的神经系统被非理性地条件反射训练成喜欢它，那么你也无法从音乐中继续获得深刻的快乐。

是的，你仍可能在最低意义上‘过得开心’，但越是开心——越是那快乐要把你从冷冰冰的感官刺激推向真正的温暖、真正的热情、真正的喜乐——你就越不得不感受到一种绝望的不协调：你自己的情感，与那个你以为自己真实活着的宇宙之间的裂缝。”

它会突破出来。

随着时间推移，即便是潜意识或半潜意识地，“我没有可为之而活之物”的事实会穿透出来。你的智慧会突破，制造一种阴郁与无乐；无论你吞下多少快乐，它都在。

但不仅如此。快乐不仅无法分散我们对客观意义缺席的注意力；第二，它也无法满足我们。

第11节，在高潮处他说：“我察看……谁知都是虚空，都是捕风。”捕风。

风是你抓不住的东西。风可以很美好，但你无法把它留住：你不能说“啊，让我抓住这阵风，这样明天我也能用。”做不到。

在身体层面与属灵层面都是如此。

我说过，尤其在我们社会里，当我们追求快乐时，真正发生的并不只是感官快乐，我们在追求超越性、在追求“值得感”。

首先，有件可怕的事你必须知道（成瘾辅导员会告诉你）：“快乐的刺激源”起初会给你一种冲击，但很快就出现耐受性。第一次，A剂量（比如某种快乐刺激“5升”）会带来极强的体验；下一次，你需要多一点才能得到同样强度；再下一次还要多一点、再多一点，因为我们会适应，而快乐刺激会在制造快乐方面逐渐失效。

这就是成瘾如何发生的：你需要更多、更多、更多。

如果你幸运，你会在它彻底毁掉你之前把它切断；否则你就只剩空虚。

那是身体的快乐：像风一样，停不住。不是说你不能享受它，而是如果你依赖它——如果你向它索取超越性——它尤其无法交付。

路易斯当然还有经典的论述：不仅在身体上我们抓不住快乐，在属灵上它也会让我们失望。

他在一段更著名的引文里说：“你一生中，总有一种不可企及的狂喜，在意识边缘徘徊，仿佛随时要突破，却永远在够不着的地方。”你知道那种感觉：当你在船上、当你坠入爱河、当你走进某种快乐经验时，你会想：“啊，终于——这就是了——这一定就是了——这下我终于会觉得值得了。”

他说：它总是在边缘要突破，但你从未真正拥有过。那些曾深深占据你灵魂的事物，都不过是它的暗示：撩拨人的一瞥，从未真正兑现的应许；刚要抓住就消散的回声。

“这是每个灵魂的隐秘签名：一种不可言说、不可平息的渴望——那是我们在遇到妻子、结交朋友、选择工作之前就渴望的东西；而我们在临终之床上，心思不再认识妻子、朋友与工作时，仍会渴望它。

如果我们信靠书籍与音乐，以为美就在其中，它们就会背叛我们。美不在其中，只是借着它们透过来。

若把它们误当作事物本身，它们就会变成哑巴的偶像，击碎敬拜者的心。

因为它们不是事物本身；它们只是我们未曾找到之花的香气，是我们未曾听过之曲的回声，是从我们尚未到访之国度传来的消息。

有一种音乐，是我们生来就仿佛记得。”

有一种音乐，我们生来就仿佛记得，我们在音乐里想听见它；有一种香气，我们生来就仿佛记得，我们在花香里想闻到它。

那是什么？

我相信——虽然你怎么证明？我几乎只要把它说出来就能证明——我们都知道这是真的：那种超越性的“值得感”不会真正透过这些事物来到。

最好的婚姻、最好的事业、最好的房子——甚至走到路尽头的人发现：它并没有给他们所要的。我们这些没有这些极致享受的人，还活在幻觉的面纱里，以为“要是我有了就好了”。不。

那么，为什么会这样？为什么快乐不够？为什么我们总想要更远？

第三章给了一个指向：“他造万物，各按其时成为美好，又将永恒安置在世人心里；然而人不能参透上帝从始至终的作为。”

这很耐人寻味。看一看。

首先他说：外面有各样美好的东西。事实上，如果你要给“快乐”下定义，它就是“美”。要给“美”下定义呢？

美，是“非工具性”的。

某物是美的，不是因为它能派上用场，而是因为它本身就令人喜悦。

你若学艺术只是为了在课上拿A，课程一结束你就再也不看艺术；那艺术对你来说只是工具性的，不是美。

但如果课程结束后你仍会去看，即使你不必去，即使它并不能让你“更有用”，反而要花你钱；那时它对你来说是美的，而不是工具。

某物之所以美，是因为你因它本身而喜悦：只是看它、让它在那里、让它进入你的眼、你的舌、你的耳、你的心。

但我们已经看到一个问题：我们所爱上的美会让我们上瘾，却又不能满足我们。为什么？

答案在第二句：“他将永恒安置在世人心里。”这几乎是圣经里非常独特的一节。

他把“无尽”放在我们心里。

这意味着：我们渴望一种“永恒的美”。而此世一切美，如果我们把心安在其上，就会失望——正如路易斯说的——因为它们只是我们尚未闻到之花的香气，只是我们尚未真正听见之曲的暗示与回声。

若有一种音乐是我们生来就仿佛记得，那它是什么？总体来说，是上帝的面。

诗篇16:11：“在你面前有满足的喜乐；在你右手中有永远的福乐。”

诗篇27:4：“有一件事我曾求耶和华，我仍要寻求：就是一生一世住在耶和华的殿中，瞻仰他的荣美，在他的殿里求问。”

总体而言，这对每个人都是一个挑战。如果这是真的，很多人会很麻烦。

你们当中很多人会说：“我信上帝。”好，为什么？我能问你为什么吗？“我信上帝。”为什么？

“那你怎么回应？”

“我去教会，或我努力遵守十诫。”为什么？

“因为我应该。”为什么？

让我继续追问。最后只剩下两种人：

真正的基督徒——生命被改变的人——他们对快乐的态度完全不同，因为他们能享受快乐，不再害怕快乐；但另一方面，快乐也不再是最重要的，因此也不再使他们上瘾。

真正的基督徒与“宗教人”（只是敬虔、只是好人）的区别在这里：宗教人觉得上帝是有用的、工具性的；而基督徒是终于发现上帝是美的。他们顺服上帝，是因为上帝是谁；不在乎还会得到什么，只因为喜悦。

宗教人和基督徒都可能顺服；宗教人和基督徒都可能迫切需要上帝；他们都可能对上帝有敬畏与尊崇。

但区别是：宗教人觉得上帝“有用”；基督徒觉得上帝“美”。你追随他、寻求他、顺服他，是因为他本身的荣美。

这在你身上真实吗？你经历过吗？那才是真正的基督信仰。

有人会说：“哇，那怎么可能？”答案是：耶稣基督。

我能告诉你福音是什么吗？圣经其实用“美”来表达福音。

我们因罪使世界变得丑陋；我们使自己的灵魂丑陋；我们使世界丑陋。

我们如何从罪中得救？

以赛亚书53章说，那位仆人从天而来，到地上来，经上这样说他：“他无佳形美容使我们注视他；也无美貌使我们羡慕他。”

耶稣基督失去了他的美。耶稣基督变得丑陋。耶稣基督枯槁。耶稣基督失去了荣耀与美。为什么？

这是上半段：因为我们的罪。

那他在十字架上做了什么？他替我们死，使我们信他的时候，圣经怎么说？

歌罗西书1:22说：如今我们借着耶稣，上帝看我们为“圣洁、没有瑕疵、无可责备”。

听着：宗教说，“顺服上帝，否则他要抓你、罚你。”

福音说：你使世界丑陋，也使自己丑陋。耶稣基督来，失去他的美；因此你信他的时候，不只是“变成更好的人”而已——你在上帝眼中是美的。你在他眼中完全洁净、美好，因为他失去美，使你得着美。

如果我对你说：“顺服上帝，否则他会抓你”，你就不得不把他当作工具；而坦白说，各种宗教本质上都是这么告诉你的。

但福音说：“不。看他为你做了什么——那是美的。”

你相信自己是个罪人吗？你相信自己迷失吗？

你们当中很多人不会。你住在纽约，你们很多人不会。

你知道那意味着什么吗？在你看见这一点之前，你永远不会觉得他美。你只会觉得他有用。

而你心里那些让你上瘾的东西，也永远不会被一个更大的美赶出去。

你的心需要一个“美”的对象。你不能靠把偶像硬扔出去就摆脱它们。它们必须被更高的美、更大的美取代——而这就是它。

如果你只是说：“他很大，他很可怕，我最好顺服，否则他会压碎我。”你就永远不会觉得他美。

唯有当你看见自己是罪人，看见他为你所做的，那才是你成为基督徒的方式：瞻仰主的荣美。

但现在，有些你已经是基督徒，你会说：“我是基督徒，可我对某个东西上瘾。”

那是因为你没有在“凝视他的美”。你没有在凝视。

你会说：“那我怎么凝视这美？”这本该是另一篇讲道。

不过我给你三件事。

第一，你必须认识耶稣——不是“泛泛的上帝”，而是耶稣。耶稣成了人。他成了一个有感官的人，成了人，进入我们的感官世界，好让我们能与他有这种亲密，使他对我们而言真成为美。

你要读关于他的事。你要尽你所能认识他的一切——一切。

这是第一。

第二，不要以为祷告是容易或简单的。

如果你想成为职业棒球选手，那要很久。你不能只是拿着球棒和球，说：“我把球抛起来，打出去，我就去谢伊球场（Shea Stadium）上场。嘿，我听说你们在外卡赛，需要人？”那需要一年又一年。

祷告比那还难。

你还没有开始明白祷告的深度。你还没有开始学会赞美。你还没有开始看见悔改里发生的事——美会出现。你会看见他的威严之美；你会看见他均衡、和谐之美；你会看见他脆弱、软弱之美。你会看见——它在祷告中临到。

第三，你需要圣灵。因为你知道，一件艺术品需要光。每个画廊都有灯光。没有圣灵，耶稣基督对你就像没有被照亮的画。

但耶稣说：“圣灵来了，要荣耀我；他要将受于我的告诉你们，并荣耀我。”

求圣灵；学习祷告；注视耶稣；并要知道：真正能胜过你心中成瘾之物的，不只是对他有一般性的认识、也不只是更努力，而是经历他的美。

在今天的播客里，提姆·凯勒会探讨《传道书》如何帮助我们面对自己的疑惑、恐惧和不确定，并把我们指向：在基督里，我们所拥有那持久的盼望与意义。《传道书》非常非常难读，而我之所以讲它，其实是想给你们一个总览。我想如果有人说，“哦，这太棒了，一切都很简单，只要通读一遍就行”，你读完只会说：“这东西怎么会在圣经里？”我们上周说过，这之所以如此——它之所以难读——原因之一（原因不止这一个，我每次也不可能都展开讲），我在这里与其说是要给你们做一份《传道书》概览，不如说是要抽取一些我认为与我们今天相关的基本主题：因为《传道书》是圣经里唯一一本从怀疑者视角写成的书——一个在没有上帝的前提下看人生的人，一个在寻求真理却并不是站在信者立场上的人。

那么，它之所以有点难，另一个原因是：在开头、结尾以及中间的几处地方，作者似乎从自己的疑惑中抽离出来，开始作出评论。至于为什么会这样——我先把我的理解亮出来——按我所能理解的，事情是这样的：这是一部作品，一部杰出的艺术作品；而且在旧约时代、在古代、在那个地区，这种写法也非常典型。一个人要表达某个观点，常常会用一种方式：基本上是“扮演一个角色”。在开头和结尾，作者谈到《传道书》——这位“教师”、这位“评论者”——他用第三人称来谈他；然后在第一章第12节，他突然转为第一人称，说：“我，这教师，我做了这事，我做了那事，我又做了这事”；接着在结尾他又抽离出来，说：“我们学到了什么？”因为他所做的，是：他是一个信的人，一个相信上帝的人，但他进入一个角色，去探索那种感觉——去探索一个正在寻找的人所经历的疑惑、怀疑、怀疑论，以及其中的种种困难。而这就是其中之一

其实这也正是为什么——有时候如果你不明白这一点，就会有点难以把握它的意思；但另一方面，这也是它如此贴切、如此切中我们处境的原因之一。

1997 年 12 月，《纽约时报杂志》做了一整篇专题、甚至是一整期的报道，题目叫《上帝去中心化》（God Decentralized）。头条文章的副标题是：“甚至没有信仰的人也在寻找上帝。”当一些主要报纸和主要杂志——由编辑、管理者和记者写作并制作，而我们也知道总体而言他们比主流社会更不宗教、更少宗教热情——当这些地方开始用整整一期来讨论宗教寻求、宗教探索的复兴时，那就一定是真的：一定正在发生。我同意他们，也同意那一期的判断：目前还没有——至少我认为——出现“找到宗教”的复兴。

并没有出现“在灵性上找到答案”的复兴。这个国家的教会和会堂并没有规模翻倍；那才叫复兴。但确实有一场巨大的“宗教寻找”的复兴——也许不是“找到”，而是“寻找”，绝对是。而《传道书》是唯一一本从“寻找者”的视角写成的书。

当你踏上灵性的寻求之旅时，有几件事情人们总会撞上。

上周我们看了其中之一，是《传道书》的作者所谈到的：痛苦。我们如何面对痛苦？我们如何处理“痛苦的问题”？有一本书就叫《痛苦的问题》（The Problem of Pain）。事实上，有很多书本质上都在讨论“痛苦的问题”。

我们怎样面对这个世界的邪恶、受苦与不公？

但这周，我们要看另一个问题：作为灵性的寻找者、寻道者，你也必须处理它。作者把它提出来，凝视它，然后他说了这些话。我们来读一读：《传道书》2:1–11。

然后在稍后一点的地方，第三章 10–14 节。我把它们放在一起读。所以我心里想：来吧，我要用享乐试验你，好知道什么是好的；但这也被证明是虚空。

我说：“嬉笑是愚昧的；享乐又能成就什么呢？”我试着用酒使自己快活，又拥抱愚昧；我的心仍以智慧引导我。

我想要……

看看人在天日之下、在自己短暂的一生中，到底做什么才算有价值。我展开了宏大的工程：我为自己建造房屋，栽种葡萄园；我修建园子和公园，在其中种下各样的果树；我挖掘水池，用来灌溉成林繁茂的树木。

我买了男女奴仆，又有在我家中生的奴仆；我所拥有的牛群羊群，比耶路撒冷在我以前的任何人都多。我也为自己积蓄金银，以及列王与各省的珍宝；我得了男女歌唱的人，又得了后宫——人的心所喜爱的种种享乐。我在耶路撒冷比我以前的任何人都更为伟大；与此同时，我的智慧仍与我同在。

凡我眼所喜爱的，我都不拒绝；我心里所想要的快乐，我都不禁止；因为我的心因我一切劳碌而喜乐，这就是我劳碌所得的报酬。然而，当我回顾我手所做的一切，和我为成就它们所付出的劳苦时，竟发现一切都是虚空，是捕风；在日光之下并无所得。我看见神使人所担负的重担：万事各按其时成为美好；神又将永恒放在世人心里，然而人却不能参透神从始至终的作为。

我知道，人莫强如终身喜乐行善；并且人人吃喝、在自己一切劳碌中得着满足，这乃是神的恩赐。我知道，神一切所做的都必永存；无可加增，无可删减。神这样行，是要人敬畏他。

那么，还有什么别的问题呢？我说过有“痛苦的问题”；但当你走出去观察人生，你会发现外面还有另一个问题。我知道我们往往不把它当作问题，但它确实是——同样是一个属灵的问题。你看，当我们面对邪恶与苦难时，我们关注的是痛；那是一个巨大的难题——上周我们已经看见了——但其中也有指向神的线索。

然而，这一周我们要看的，是“享乐的问题”，不是“痛苦的问题”。你知道，我也知道：当我和人谈到神时，“你怎么看神？”很多人会说：“我对神有一个问题。”

那个问题是什么？

嗯，痛苦、邪恶和受苦。我想我从来没有真正跟谁谈过，对方说：“是的，我对相信上帝一直很警惕/很提防。为什么？因为快乐。”

为什么世界上会有快乐？为什么快乐是这个样子？今晚我面对的是这件事，而他今晚所面对的也是这件事；这应该让你不安，因为快乐是一个巨大的难题。对你们当中的一些人来说，今晚这里有一张便条——而你知道你是谁，可能你已经知道了。快乐是你生命中最大的问题。

当然，也许你要等我们讲完才知道自己是哪一类人；但你们中有些人立刻就知道。快乐是一个谜。快乐是一个问题，而快乐里面有许多指向性的线索。现在，他在这里教导我们三件事，我打算这样来表述：他教我们关于快乐——它承诺什么、它如何失败（其实，是它承诺什么、它为什么失败），以及它如何指向更远的事。

好吗？基本上，在他每一个主题里从头到尾都在做这三件事：它承诺什么、它为什么失败、它如何指向超越。首先，是它承诺什么。在第 1 到第 3 节里，我们看到一些非常、非常耐人寻味的东西。他说：“我心里说：来吧，我要用享乐试验你，好知道什么是善。”于是我试着用酒使自己快乐，又纵容愚昧。

“我想看看人在天日之下，在自己短暂的一生中，做什么才算值得。”这很重要。注意“来吧/来吧，现在”（come now）这个词。他直到现在才进入他的计划——也就是为享乐而活。那么，在这之前发生了什么？

你看，他是从第 1 章里所做的一件事出来的。我没有把那段印给你，我们手头也没有，我读给你听。他已经经历过某些东西，然后才转向享乐。理解这一点非常重要，才能明白他在说什么。在第 1 章里他说：“我专心用智慧考察、探究天底下所做的一切。”但当我看见日光之下的万事，我看见它们全是虚空，是捕风；因为“多有智慧就多有愁烦；加增知识的，就加增忧伤。”

那么，他做了什么呢？他起初并没有决定为享乐而活。他说：“我要用我的头脑并且”

去审视人生，我要弄明白生命的意义是什么、生命的目的是什么，真正的生命到底是关于什么，以及为什么事情会以那样的方式发生。现在，记得我读给你们听过，我们上周也提到过：他说，我观察人生，是要明白“日光之下”的人生。在《传道书》里他一再提到“日光之下”这个词；他是在告诉我们，他是以一种务实的、世俗的人的视角来看待人生。

他看人生，就像约翰·列侬所唱的那样：“想象一下，没有天堂，没有地狱，没有永恒；只有今生，为着今天而活。”他说，如果我们所拥有的只有这些，我们不知道从前是什么，也不知道以后会怎样。如果我们所拥有的只有这些，他就去那里，想要弄清楚生命的意义；那么他得出了什么决定？他判定了什么？他下了什么结论？他结论是：如果今生就是全部，那么关于那些重大问题，就没有答案。如果今生就是全部，就没有答案——我们……我们……我们为什么在这里？

我们到底是为了什么？我们的目的是什么？什么是对，什么是错？绝对的道德标准是什么？什么是真理？

我们死后去哪里？没有答案。就在这时，他转向了享乐。现在这非常重要。当他按着现实的样子审视人生，来到一个结论说“没有答案”，然后他转向享乐——他其实是在重演西方历史。

首先，你们要知道，我们这些住在美国的人，你们所处的是我们所谓的“西方社会”。而且由于科技的发展，这个“西方”越来越不只是美国和欧洲的范围。但在西方社会里，我们是第一个（整体上）其文化领袖宣称“没有答案”的社会。我的意思是，从来没有一个社会不是建立在某种宗教或哲学之上，并且说“答案在这里”。它可以是佛教的，可以是神道教的，可以是伊斯兰教的，可以是基督教的、犹太教的，或者别的什么。但我们真的是第一个——甚至我会说：那共产主义呢？

不，对不起，共产主义也“相信”。他们知道答案，他们知道历史要走向哪里，他们知道你该做什么，他们……

知道了，他们明白，对吧？他们给出答案。现在，这些答案也许各不相同，你知道，它们彼此矛盾，不可能全都对。但关键在这里：只有一种答案实际上是在说——根本没有答案。

今生就是全部。你死了，就结束了；我们不知道自己为什么在这里。我们却要在这种观念上建立一个文明。那么，当你这样做，会发生什么？我告诉你，让我给你一个小插曲——其实我们这儿就有一个小插曲——但我再给你讲另一个。

在《无线电时代》（我想那部伍迪·艾伦的电影就叫这个名字）里，电影开头不久，一个男孩去上课——这可真能教你从此去上科学课。他去上课，听到了某件事，然后整个人都崩溃了：沮丧、抑郁，几乎要疯了。母亲不得不把他拖去见辅导员，让他们坐下，辅导员说：怎么了？小男孩说——你知道，他大概八九岁——我猜他发现这件事已经一两周了。他说：你知道宇宙正在膨胀吗？

你意识到最终一切都会燃尽吗？你意识到一切终将结束吗？做任何事还有什么用？那辅导员怎么说呢？在任何其他文明里，辅导员会说：那不是真的。

有很多理由。生命不止于此。有对有错，有上帝，有永恒——你知道他们会怎么说。但这个辅导员对他说不出什么，因为他是对的——可他同时也快疯了。而如果你在这个社会里坚持那套，我们就会说他“疯了”，为什么？

G.K.切斯特顿说过：在我们的社会里，疯子并不不合逻辑；在我们的社会里，疯子只是太合逻辑了。换句话说，这个小男孩是在说：我终于从学校明白了人生是怎么回事。没有答案。一切都会燃尽。

没有人有什么意义。到最后，我做什么都没有区别。一切都会结束。你看，他是在讲逻辑，所以才会被边缘化、被送走。因为你看，外面根本没有人。

从来没有一个文明

对这些基本问题给出了一套“不回答的回答”。其他所有社会——不管它们是什么样——也许它们是错的。我的意思是，从我的观点，作为一个基督徒来看，其中一些确实是错的。但至少它们在那里。因而，人们不会仅仅因为在逻辑上把文化对现实所说的一切都抽掉，就有发疯的危险。

这个小男孩已经快要疯了。那他们会对他说什么呢？当任何人开始那样说话时，你会对他说什么？点起灯来。吃个冰淇淋甜筒，打场球。

如果他再大一点，他们会说，你知道，出去，亲个女孩，做爱，爬一座山，看看风景。你知道，闻闻玫瑰的香气。得了吧。现在他们在说什么？这听起来就像是，嗯嗯，你知道那是什么。

他们转向享乐是为了什么？看第3节：为了获得一种“我有价值”的感觉。我们这个社会之所以如此，是因为当你没有任何比你自己更大的东西可为之而活，当你不知道什么是真理，当你没有任何值得为之死去的事业——你不是为你的家庭而死，你不是为真理而死，你不是为国家而死，你不是为上帝而死——你知道，没有任何东西比你更大，因此这些问题就没有答案。那我们怎么办？

既然没有客观的意义，我们就试着制造主观的意义。因为我们的“智慧”告诉我们万事都是虚空的，所以我们就转向享乐。但我们对享乐的期待现在变得非常复杂。我们在这里看到一个应许：这里发生的事远不止“快乐”那么简单。

在我们的社会里，总的来说，我们追求的不仅仅是快乐。我的意思是，老鼠也追求快乐。老鼠交配就只是为了交配。但当我们发生性关系时，它不仅仅是身体的体验，还会发生什么？你开始说：我被爱了，我被看重，我的人生是值得的。

看，这就是第3节所说的。他转向享乐，不是为了享乐。他转向享乐，是为了处理这样一个事实：他没有任何比自己更大的东西可为之而活。他寻找的不只是享乐。他寻找的不只是性。

他所寻找的是：他想要拥有那种……我知道这在录音里。

有一种是身体的高潮，也有一种是属灵的高潮。身体的高潮，不过是某些化学物质刺激下丘脑的问题。但属灵的高潮是：你会说，生命是值得的；我的生命是值得的；有爱。

好吧，伯恩斯坦说，当他听贝多芬《第五交响曲》的时候，他不只是跟着打拍子。

你听音乐的时候，会忍不住这样。音乐有一种“身体性的东西”；你听音乐，到底是什么？那里发生了什么？从身体层面说，是神经性的。神经系统……

你们在录音带上——我刚才做了些好笑的、有节奏的动作，你知道，我也不知道录音里的人会明白你们在笑什么；我只是做了一点滑稽的节奏性动作，好吧。我只是想表达得更贴切一点。贝多芬说——抱歉——伯恩斯坦说，当我听贝多芬的时候，我感到世界上有些东西是对的，宇宙中有些东西是对的；有些东西是说得通的；有些东西一贯地遵行它自己的规律；有些东西永远不会让我们失望。

你知道那段话——那是我最喜欢的引言之一——但他在说什么？“我的生命是值得的。”

我记得在七月的时候，我读到《纽约时报》杂志上一篇文章，题为《Lux Populi》（不是 Vox Populi），讲的是这样一个事实：奢侈品正在被卖出去、非常昂贵的奢侈品——不再只是卖给某个地方少数几个富人，而是到处都在卖。人们为奢侈品付出惊人的价钱。

在文章里，有一处采访了一个制造这些奢侈品的人。他们问他说：你看，好吧，你的毛衣比下一家的毛衣贵二十倍，你的毛衣真的比竞争对手好二十倍吗？

他怎么回答？他说：“我们卖的是梦想。”他解释道：当你看到我们的一家精品店，你走进去，买一支口红，或买这个买那个，里面带着一个梦想。

他在说什么？这是一种很漂亮、很委婉的说法，但他说得对：这里发生的远不止“快乐”这么简单。这里发生的远不止那种触感——当然，你知道，他的毛衣大概真的非常舒服——但这里有一种完全不同的东西，只是

就好像性不再是关于性本身，音乐也不再是关于音乐本身；他真正想说的是：你买那件毛衣，是为了让自己觉得——你知道——我的人生是值得的。你在制造一种主观意义。但我们得把正在发生的事看清楚：在一个没有客观意义的社会里，人对享乐会出现一种近乎狂躁的急切。说实话，我不确定我们是否能说历史上曾经有过这样一种社会——社会当然一直有它的享乐——但有没有一个社会会把这种“新陈代谢”和娱乐性，倾注到性活动里、倾注到物质的奢侈享受里，像我们今天这样？从来没有。也许希腊—罗马世界在开始崩解的时候有一点像，但那也是因为，正如《传道书》这里所说的那个人所讲的：那是因为他们失去了相信任何客观意义的能力，于是他们不得不转向；因此他们转向享乐——不只是为了享乐本身，而是为了获得一种“我值得、我有价值、我这一生不是徒然”的感觉。现在，在我继续往下之前，你明白吗？让我把这应用到你个人：什么叫过一种以享乐为中心的生活？

你们很多人并不觉得自己在过这种生活，因为你看，这里一开始就说：“喜笑是愚昧。”看第二节，“享乐”成就了什么？这里“喜笑”和“享乐”在希伯来文里是两个词，它们并不完全是同义词。“喜笑”真正的意思更像是一种纵情狂欢；“喜笑”意味着失去分辨力。相对地，第二个词“享乐”更带有一种精致、审美的意味。你看，一个是全情投入、放开喉咙的派对式狂欢；另一个是精致。一个是把自己灌醉；另一个是买艺术品。但我要告诉你，他是在说：它们是一样的，它们是一样的。

你也许知道浪子回头的故事，但它不只是关于一个放荡不羁的弟弟。事实上，耶稣讲这个故事，是为了同时对两类人说话：一类是逃离上帝的人；另一类是试图靠自己的好行为来赚取上帝之爱的的人。在《浪子之神》一书中，提姆·凯勒展示了这个家喻户晓的故事如何揭示福音的核心——这信息既给悖逆的弟弟带来盼望，也给论断人的哥哥带来盼望，并邀请所有人来经历上帝那“挥霍般”的、慷慨的，

那种奢华的恩典。无论你是基督徒，还是仍在探索信仰，
“挥霍的上帝”（The Prodigal God）都会帮助你以全新的眼光来看你与基督的关系。
《挥霍的上帝》是我们对你本月奉献的感谢；你的礼物将帮助 Gospel in Life 把盼望——

说到底，我不知道你是性行为很多，还是你只是做着一份你讨厌的工作——
因为它对任何人都没有什么建设性，却能赚到足够的钱，
好让你将来有一天能去做你真正想做的事。
这和一个整天狂欢的人其实是一回事。
你看，享乐主义有“市中心”和“上城区”两种路数，
但你也看得到：有奥普拉·温弗瑞，也有杰瑞·斯普林格——本质却一样。
你生命的“底线”到底是什么？

你有没有什么值得你去死的？
你有没有什么是你愿意拼到底的？
有没有任何真理，是你承认它就是你生命的底线？
所以，真的是安逸、富足吗？
是感觉良好吗？

是感官的快感吗？如果你那样做，你并不只是为了“快乐”。
你是在想借此得到一个“人生”。
你是在想借此得到一种价值感、健全感——而这一切终究会失败。
这就是第二点。

第一点是它所应许的；第二点，他给我们看见的是：它会失败，并解释为什么。
现在，有一件事很重要，哇，这非常有力：这不是一个普通人。不，他不是。
第 10 节：
“我眼所求的，我没有留下不给它。”

这是什么意思？“我眼所求的，我没有留下不给它。”
其实 99.99% 的人都没法这么说。
我们每个人都会拒绝自己眼所想要的各种东西，
主要是因为我们没有钱或没有权势去得到它们。
也正因如此，我们当中大多数人其实正走在这条路上：
把享乐当作生命的底线，把它当作我们活着的主要目标；
只不过总体来说，除非你是那种夜夜笙歌的人，
我们往往会把这一点对自己藏得很深、很深。

我今晚就是想把这一点向你们当中的一些人揭开。
但是他

他说，如果你走在那条路上却感到空虚，你往往不会说“这条路本身有问题”，反而倾向于说：“一定是因为我走得还不够远。”如果我能在湖边建起那栋房子；如果我的恋爱生活能更好；如果我能瘦下来——换句话说，你觉得自己之所以空虚，是因为你在这条路上还没有走到尽头。你在责怪自己，其实问题在于那条路。

而这一点之所以格外有力，是因为他把自己描绘成“最顶尖的人”——那种真正能随心所欲、满足任何感官享受的人之一，属于那 0.001% 的极少数。

有人会说：“我怎么知道这事真的发生过？你倒让我怀疑：这个人真的是国王，还是只是在扮演国王的角色？”这并不重要。他想说的是：我挑战你。

看看那些处在 0.001% 的人的人生。读他们的传记，读他们的采访。他们发现的正是他所发现的。只是——他们之所以那么不快乐、之所以那么被摧毁，是因为他们不再活在我们所处的那层幻象的薄纱之下：他们走到了路的尽头，却发现那里是死胡同。我们也空虚，但我们会说：“如果我再往前一点就好了。”可他们已经走到那儿了。

这就是他们如此不快乐的原因。他们不是因为富有而快乐；他们之所以不快乐，是因为他们走到了路的尽头。他们看见了：他们仍然只是他们自己。这是一个有力的论证，说明“享乐最终会让我们失望”。

并不是说它不能带来高潮；不是说它不能带来神经系统的节律快感；也不是说它不能带来一件漂亮毛衣的舒适；而是说，它无法带来“值得活下去的意义”。它不能给你你真正想要的东西——也就是超越。

我们在寻找一种方式，想要绕开这样一个事实：我们没有什么可为之而活。

我们没有坚实的东西；没有确信无疑的东西；没有能把我们带到群星之上的东西；没有我们相信能在我们之后仍然存留、仍然被看见的东西。我们在寻找超越，而在这一点上它必定失败。

彻底失败。以两种方式。第一，享乐会……

无法分散你的注意力。在第三节，他说：我的心仍以智慧引导我。他说，我试着用酒使自己欢畅，又抱住愚昧，但我的心仍在引导我。到第九节他说：我比耶路撒冷任何人都更大、更强。

在这一切之中，我的智慧仍与我同在。这是什么意思？他在说什么？我告诉你他在说什么。这是我最喜欢的一段 C.S. 刘易斯（C.S. Lewis）的引文之一——正如你们中有些人知道的。

他想说的是：无论我多么努力，想借着享乐来忘掉“我没有什么可为之而活、也没有什么真正有意义”的事实，我都试过了，但那事实还是冲破一切浮了上来。享乐——你看，主观的快乐，想要抹去客观快乐的缺失，就像用太少的黄油去抹太多的面包。你把它摊开，可等刀抹到末端，那里已经没有黄油了。

我的意思是，黄油根本不够，只是被吸进去、沉下去了。同样地，主观的快乐之所以失败，是因为无论他多么努力想停止思考，他的智慧仍与他同在，真相不断穿透进来，你知道的。若你的生命——若你的起源只是个意外，你的归宿不过是腐烂；若你的生命——若你的起源无足轻重，你的归宿也无足轻重——那就要有勇气承认：你的生命无足轻重。我们总想把这个念头挡在外面，但这正是刘易斯所说的。

他说：让我们假设自然是唯一存在的。

在时间之中、空间里的原子进行着这场毫无意义的戏剧；在一连串上百次的偶然之中，令人遗憾地竟产生了像我们这样的东西——有意识的存在者；而如今我们知道，我们自己的意识乃是整个无意义过程的偶然结果，因此它本身也就无意义——尽管对我们来说，唉，我们却感觉自己很重要。

在这种处境下，你也许会决定：那就尽可能享受吧，对吗？说：嗨，生命没有意义。那就好好玩一场。为什么不呢？

这又有什么分别？我不如就去追求这些美好的感觉。你也许会决定尽可能享受，但你无法接受——现在听好了——你无法以最低等、动物性的意义来接受。也许你爱上了一个女孩，但如果你知道、并且你记得……

你对世界的看法意味着：她的容貌与品格的一切美，不过是原子碰撞偶然产生的、转瞬即逝的图案；而你对这些美的反应，也只是一种心理的、化学式的磷光现象，源于你遗传物质的运作。若你知道并记得，音乐那“空中的意义”（更深的意义）纯属幻觉，你之所以喜欢它，只是因为你的神经系统在非理性的条件作用下被训练成喜欢它，那么你就无法继续从音乐中获得非常认真的愉悦。

是的，在最低的意义上，你也许仍能“玩得开心”；但正因为它变得越美好，正因为它越可能把你从冰冷的感官享受推入真实的温度、真实的热情与真实的喜乐，你就越会被迫感受到：你自己的情感与你自以为真实所处的宇宙之间，存在着一种无望的失调。它会突破出来。

随着时间推移，即便是无意识或半意识的，那种“你没有任何可活的目标”的事实——所谓的“智慧”——也会突破出来。它会带来一种阴郁；无论你试图攫取多少快乐，它都会制造出一种无喜、无乐的状态。可是，不仅快乐无法把我们从“没有客观真实”的处境中分散开；其次，它也无法满足我们。

因为在第11节的高潮处，他说：我回顾这一切，结果一切都是虚空，都是捕风；都是捕风。

风是你留不住的东西。风可以是很美妙的体验，但你无法把它留住；你不能说：“啊，让我把那东西抓住，好让我明天还能有这阵风。”做不到。

现在，在身体层面与属灵层面上——你看，这里真正令人害怕的是：特别在我们的社会里，我们追求快乐时真正发生的事情是，我们要的并不只是身体与感官的快感，我们要的是超越，我们要的是意义，我们要的是某种“值得为之疯狂”的价值。

那么，首先，有一件最可怕的事必须知道——戒瘾辅导会告诉你这一点——就是：令人愉悦的东西起初会给你一种“冲击”和快感，但随后就会出现耐受性；同样的愉悦刺激，在某个剂量——比如说，某种愉悦之物五升——会带来极其、极其大的……

第一次你会有那种体验，但下一次要得到同样的体验、同样的快感，就得多一点；再下一次又得多一点；再下一次还要多一点。因为我们会适应，带来快感的“因素/刺激”会在制造快感这件事上逐渐失效。

这就是成瘾如何发生的。你需要更多、更多、更多；如果你够幸运，你还能在它彻底毁掉你之前把它戒掉，而那之后你只会感到空虚。而这就是肉体的快乐：肉体的快乐像风一样，留不住。不是说你不能享受它；而是说如果你真的倚靠它——不是享受它，而是依赖它——如果你把它当作获得“超越感”的途径，尤其如此，它就绝不可能交付你想要的。路易斯当然对此有一些经典的论述：不只是肉体的快乐我们抓不住，属灵层面上它也会以这种方式叫我们失望。

他在一段更著名的话里说：你一生之中，总有一种难以企及的狂喜，仿佛一直悬在你意识的触手可及之处，却又永远差那么一点。那种“快要突破进来”的感觉——比如你坐在船上随波起伏的时候，或者你坠入爱河的时候。你知道他怎么说吗？他说，当你正要进入一次令人愉悦的经历时，你会想：啊，终于——这就是它；好像不知怎么地，这次就真的是它了。那种“在边缘、就要突破”的感觉，可你却从未真正拥有过。凡是曾经深深攫住你灵魂的一切，都不过是它的暗示——撩拨人的一瞥、从未真正兑现的应许、在刚刚被捕捉到时就消散的回声……这是每个灵魂的隐秘署名。

那不可言说、也无法平息的渴望——在我们遇见妻子、结交朋友、选择工作之前，我们就已经渴望它；而当我们躺在临终床上、心思已不再认识妻子、朋友或工作时，我们仍会渴望它。我们以为美就安置在书本或音乐里；但如果我们信靠它们，它们就会背叛我们。美不在它们里面；美只是藉着它们临到。如果把它们误当作“那东西”本身，它们就会变成又哑又无用的偶像，击碎敬拜者的心。因为它们不是那东西本身；它们只是那……

那是我们尚未找到的花香，那是我们从未听过的旋律的回声，是来自我们从未到访过的国度的消息。

它带着一段我们生来就记得的音乐。有一段音乐是我们生来就记得的，我们在音乐里想要再听见它；有一种气息是我们生来就记得的，我们在花朵里想要再闻到它。那么，那是什么呢？我相信，尽管你会问“这怎么证明呢？”——我几乎只要把它说出来，就已经足以证明了。

我们知道这是真的：那种超越的感觉并没有真正被传递过来。正如他所说，最好的婚姻、最好的事业、最好的房子……事实上，那些一路走到尽头的人会发现，它并没有给他们带来他们原以为会有的东西；而那些知道“最好是什么”的人也会这样说。我们这些并没有这些美好享乐的人，仍然被幻象笼罩——我们想：要是……只要……不。可是，为什么会这样？为什么享乐不够呢？

为什么我们总想要越过它、到更远处去？好，第三章里有个指针。那里说——第三章还有很多内容，但今晚我们不可能全部展开——他说：“神造万物，各按其时成为美好；又将永恒安置在世人心里，然而人不能参透神从始至终的作为。”

这就很有意思了。你看看。首先他说，外面有各样美好的事物。其实，如果你想知道“享乐”的定义，那就是“美”。那你想知道“美”的定义吗？

美是什么？一个东西之所以美，是因为它不是工具性的。一个东西是美的，是因为它本身就令人愉悦，只为它自己而存在。你看，如果你学习艺术只是因为必须在课上拿到 A，等课程一结束，你就再也不去看艺术了——艺术当然也可以。

好吧，那它对你来说就只是工具性的；它对你来说并不“美”。但如果后来你会在不必去的时候也去——在它并不能把你带到哪里、事实上还要花你钱的时候——你看，这就说明：有些东西之所以美，不是因为它有用。

一个东西是美的，是因为你单单因着对它的喜悦而得到满足：只是去看它，只是让它在那里，只是把它放在你的眼睛上、舌头上、耳朵上、心上。那就是某样东西的“美”。它是

美好。但我们已经看到，问题在于：那些我们把心安放其上的美好事物，会让我们上瘾；可与此同时，它们又不能使我们满足。为什么？

嗯，在于第二个分句：他将永恒放在世人的心里。这几乎是《圣经》中独一无二的一节经文。他把“无尽”放进我们的心里。意思是，我们里面有一种对永恒之美的渴望；而这里的一切美好，如果我们把心系在其上，正如路易斯所说，它们会令我们失望，因为它们只不过是那朵我们尚未闻到的花的香气。

它们只是一个暗示，是我们其实还未真正听见的旋律的回声。你知道，如果有一段我们仿佛生来就记得的音乐，那么那是什么？嗯，总的来说，那就是上帝的面容。诗篇16篇11节：“在你面前有满足的喜乐，在你右手中有永远的福乐。”诗篇27篇4节。

“一件事”——那才是让人上瘾的。“有一件事，我曾求耶和华，我仍要寻求：就是一生一世住在耶和华的殿中，瞻仰耶和华的荣美，在他的殿里求问。”

现在，总的来说，这是对每个人的挑战。如果这是真的，很多人就麻烦了。

你们当中很多人说：“我信上帝。”好，那为什么？我能问你为什么吗？“我信上帝。”为什么？好。

那么，你对此做什么呢？“我去教会。”或者“我努力遵守诫命。”为什么？“因为我应该这样。”为什么？

让我继续追问你。到最后，其实只有两种——看，基督徒，真正的基督徒，他们的生命被改变了；他们对享乐的态度之所以如此不同，是因为我们能够享受这些乐趣。我们现在不再害怕它们；但另一方面，它们也不是最重要的，因此也不会使我们上瘾。一个生命真的被改变的基督徒，与一个宗教徒之间的区别在于：宗教徒觉得上帝是有用的、是工具性的；而基督徒是那些终于发现上帝是美的的人，他们顺服他，只因为他是谁；不在乎除此之外还能给他们带来什么，只为那份喜悦。

你看，宗教徒和基督徒都顺服；宗教徒和基督徒都可能迫切需要上帝。他们可能顺服上帝，因此也可能对上帝充满敬畏与尊崇；但区别在于

基督徒与只是宗教徒、只是好人的区别在于：他们会觉得这些东西“有用”，但基督徒觉得它们“美”。你跟随他、寻求他、顺服他，是因为他本身的美。你是这样的吗？你经历过吗？这才是真正的基督信仰。

有人会说：哇，这怎么可能发生呢？答案在这里。耶稣基督——我能告诉你福音是什么吗？圣经其实是用“美”的语言来讲福音的。我们因为罪，使世界变得丑陋。

我们使自己的灵魂变得丑陋，也使世界变得丑陋。我们要怎样从罪中得拯救呢？以赛亚书第53章告诉我们：那位仆人从天而来，来到地上，关于他经上这样说——这是以赛亚书53章——“他无佳形美容，使我们注视他；也无美貌，使我们羡慕他。”

耶稣基督失去了他的美。耶稣基督变得丑陋。耶稣基督变得枯槁。耶稣基督失去了他的荣耀，失去了他的美。为什么？

这是第一部分：因为我们的罪。那他在十字架上死的时候做了什么？他替我们死在十字架上，使我们信他的时候——经上怎么说？歌罗西书第一章二十二节告诉我们：如今当我们与耶稣同在、信靠神时，神看我们，见我们是圣洁的、毫无瑕疵、无可责备的。听着，宗教说：你要顺服神，不然他就要惩罚你。

福音说：你让世界变丑了，也让自己变丑了。耶稣基督来了，失去了他的美，使你如今信他的时候——这不只是让你在某种意义上变成更好的人——你在神眼中是美的。你对他而言有一种纯粹的美，因为他失去了他的美，好让你得着。现在，如果我对你说“顺服神，不然他就要惩罚你”，你就只能把他当作达到目的的工具；坦白说，每一种宗教基本上都是这么告诉你的。

但福音说：不，你要看他为你做了什么——那是美的。你相信自己是罪人吗？你相信自己迷失了吗？现在你们当中很多人并不这么认为。

我是说，你们住在纽约。你们当中很多人不会这么认为。你知道这意味着什么吗？在你看见这一点之前，你永远不会觉得他是美的；你只会觉得他是“有用”的。

你就会把一切都当成工具性的手段，而你心里那些让你上瘾、捆绑你的东西，也永远不会因为一种更大的美而被抛开。

你的心需要一个“美”的对象。你不能只是靠着努力把那些抓住你的东西丢掉；它们必须被一种更高的美、更大的美所取代、所挤出去——而这就是那个美。你永远不会觉得他美，如果你只是说：他很大、他很大，我最好顺服他，因为他会把我碾碎。

那么，我们为什么不能用那种方式得到“美”呢？只有当你看见自己是个罪人，并且看见他为你做了什么，你才会看见美。人成为基督徒，就是这样：看见主的美。但现在，你们当中有些人是基督徒，你们知道自己在说什么吗？你们在说：我是基督徒，可是我对某样东西上瘾。

对吧？那是因为你没有在凝视他的美；你没有在注视。你说：那我怎么去凝视这种美呢？这其实得另讲一篇讲道，不过——

我先告诉你三件事。第一，你必须去认识耶稣——不是泛泛地认识“神”，而是认识耶稣。耶稣成为了一个人。他成了一个可以被感官接触、被经验到的人，进入了我们的感官世界；这样我们才可能与他有这种亲密，好让他真实地成为我们的美。

我必须读有关他的事。你必须尽可能认识关于他的一切——一切。这是第一。第二，祷告是非常深的。第一件事是：去认识耶稣。

第二，不要以为祷告是容易的、简单的。你要把一个人训练成职业棒球选手，是要花很长时间的。你不能只是走出去：给你一根球棒，给你一个球。

我把球往空中一抛，我打中球，然后我就要去上场了——谢伊体育场（Shea Stadium）。嘿，我听说你在参加一场疯狂的赛车。

你需要人手吗？这要花上年复一年。祷告比那更难。你甚至还没开始明白祷告的深处。你还没有开始学会什么叫赞美。

你还没有开始看见悔改会带来什么——美会发生。你会看见他威严的美；你会看见他匀称、和谐的美；你会看见他脆弱的美、他软弱的美。

你就是会看见。它是在祷告中临到的。但第三，你

你需要圣灵，因为你知道，一件艺术品需要光。每一家美术馆都有灯光。没有圣灵，耶稣基督就毫无意义。

但耶稣说：当圣灵来了，他要荣耀我；他要将属于我的启示出来，并荣耀我。求圣灵，学习祷告，注目耶稣，并且要知道：你内心真正需要、能使你胜过成瘾的，并不只是对他是谁的一般性认知，也不是更努力地去做，而是经历他的美。
