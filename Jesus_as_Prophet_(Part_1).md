### Introduction: Who is Jesus?

Who is Jesus? The Bible says He's fully God, the creator of the universe, and at the same time, fully human. Lose one of those and you lose Christianity. Join us for today's podcast where Tim Keller explores the person and promises of Jesus Christ.

### The Importance of Understanding Jesus

Every January and June, the pastors get together and we do a short series together on some theme or subject. And what we're doing here in the month of January, and actually, if you want to see how the subject's divided and how all the assignments have been divvied out, you can find that on the very back page of the bullet and tells you what we're doing in January. After speaking about, we're talking about how to understand Jesus. Now that means that somebody might say, but aren't you always talking about how to understand Jesus? And the answer is every so often, it's a good idea to give people a helicopter ride in a comprehensive way a look at the biblical doctrine of Christ.

> "The biblical doctrine of Christ means a look at all the various facets of what the Bible teaches about Jesus."

**The Bible teaches us about Jesus' person. He is human and he's divine.**

### Jesus as Prophet, Priest, and King

The Bible teaches three great things about his work. All of the things the Bible tells us that he has done, fit into three basic categories. He's a prophet, he's a priest, and he's a king. And it behooves us to spend a month in which we basically take a survey of those three aspects of his work.

- Prophet: Revealer of God
- Priest: Redeemer and Advocate
- King: Supreme Authority

### The Dangers of Partial Understanding

Now let me just show you what happens if you leave any of them out. There are plenty of people that I have run into in New York. And I've been thinking a lot about this because I've been reading a book. I'll refer to it again. It's called New York in the 50s by Dan Wakefield, who was a Columbia University student in the early 50s and stayed in Grant Village, and became part of the beat generation in the Bohemian scene.

> "You can't have Jesus with only as priest and not prophet or king."

**He's all prophet and all priest and all king. He just can't have one piece of him.**

### Jesus as the Ultimate Prophet

Let me read, believe it or not, have a scripture text, yes. Let me read from Acts chapter three, verse 17 to 26. Now, I just gave you the introduction to the month. Now, Acts chapter three, verse 17 to 26, read it, and there's two basic things that we want to draw out of this, that tells you something about Jesus as the great and ultimate prophet and revealer of God to us.

> "This is my beloved son, hear ye him."

**Jesus is not just a prophet because as God, he shows us who God is because he's so compassionate and loving in the way in which he talks and acts and moves.**

### Conclusion: The Supremacy of Jesus' Revelation

Father, we thank you that all this is for us, we thank you that because Jesus Christ came and died, you can look at our sin and yet fall on our neck and say, put on my robe, put on my ring, let's kill the fatted calf, let's dance and sing for your mind, your home. Father, when we see Jesus Christ and only when we see Jesus Christ, are we able to really see you, only he reveals you, only he does. Thank you for the uniqueness, thank you for the supremacy of his revelation of your being and of your radiance and of your glory.

**We pray that tonight, the two things we might learn is that we need to study the Bible, we need to study, here's the scripture, we need to know it inside out.**

## 中文翻译

### 引言：耶稣是谁？

耶稣是谁？圣经说他是完全的神，是宇宙的创造者，同时又是完全的人。失去其中之一，你就失去了基督教。加入我们今天的播客，蒂姆·凯勒将探讨耶稣基督的人物和应许。

### 理解耶稣的重要性

每年一月和六月，牧师们会聚在一起，围绕某个主题或课题进行简短的系列讲道。在一月份，我们正在做的事情，如果你想看到主题如何划分以及所有任务如何分配，你可以在公告的最后一页找到，告诉你我们在一月份做的事情。我们在谈论如何理解耶稣。有人可能会说，你不是一直在谈论如何理解耶稣吗？答案是，偶尔给人们一个全面的直升机视角来看待基督的圣经教义是个好主意。

> “基督的圣经教义意味着查看圣经关于耶稣教导的各个方面。”

**圣经教导我们关于耶稣的人性。他是人，也是神。**

### 耶稣作为先知、祭司和君王

圣经教导关于他工作的三件伟大事情。圣经告诉我们的所有事情都可以归入三个基本类别。他是先知，他是祭司，他是君王。我们有必要花一个月的时间基本上对他的这三个工作方面进行调查。

- 先知：上帝的启示者
- 祭司：救赎者和代言人
- 君王：最高权威

### 片面理解的危险

现在让我给你展示一下如果你忽略其中任何一个会发生什么。我在纽约遇到了很多这样的人。我一直在思考这个问题，因为我在读一本书。我会再次提到它。它叫做《50年代的纽约》，作者是丹·维克菲尔德，他是50年代初哥伦比亚大学的学生，住在格林威治村，成为波希米亚场景中的一部分。

> “你不能只把耶稣当作祭司，而不是先知或君王。”

**他是完全的先知、完全的祭司和完全的君王。你不能只拥有他的一部分。**

### 耶稣作为终极先知

让我读一下，相信与否，有一段经文，是的。让我读一下使徒行传第三章，第17到26节。现在，我刚刚给你介绍了这个月的内容。现在，读使徒行传第三章，第17到26节，并且我们想从中提取出两个基本的东西，告诉你关于耶稣作为伟大和终极先知以及上帝启示者的一些事情。

> “这是我的爱子，你们要听他。”

**耶稣不仅仅是一个先知，因为作为神，他向我们展示了神是谁，因为他在说话、行动和移动的方式上是如此富有同情心和爱心。**

### 结论：耶稣启示的至高性

父啊，我们感谢你，这一切都是为我们准备的，我们感谢你，因为耶稣基督来了并死了，你可以看我们的罪，却仍然扑在我们脖子上说，穿上我的袍子，戴上我的戒指，让我们宰杀肥牛犊，让我们跳舞唱歌，因为你是我的，你回家了。父啊，当我们看到耶稣基督时，只有当我们看到耶稣基督时，我们才能真正看到你，只有他揭示了你，只有他做到了。感谢你他的独特性，感谢你他启示你存在和光辉的至高性。

**我们祈祷今晚，我们可能学到的两件事是，我们需要学习圣经，我们需要学习，这里是经文，我们需要彻底了解它。**
