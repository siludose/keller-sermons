## English Transcript / 英文原文

today's podcast where Tim Keller explores the person and promises of Jesus  Christ. Every January and June, the pastors get together and we do a short series together on some  theme or subject. And what we're doing here in the month of January, and actually, if you want to see  how the subject's divided and how all the assignments have been divvied out, you can  find that on the very back page of the bullet and tells you what we're doing in January. After speaking about, we're talking about how to understand Jesus. Now that means that somebody might say, but aren't you always talking about how to understand  Jesus?

And the answer is every so often, it's a good idea to give people a helicopter ride in  a comprehensive way a look at the biblical doctrine of Christ. The biblical doctrine of Christ means a look at all the various facets of what the Bible  teaches about Jesus. The Bible teaches us about Jesus person. He is human and he's divine. And in the Scott last week, in the morning evening service dealt with that.

And it's very, very important, as certain points, to take a look at the two sides of what  the Bible teaches about Christ's percentage. Because if you only see him as human and not divine or only see him as divine and not human,  you get into some tremendous trouble and you have a distortion of what it's not Christianity,  whatever you come up with, it's not Christianity unless you keep that together. And the Bible, besides teaching those two great things about his person, the Bible teaches  three great things about his work. All of the things the Bible tells us that he has done, fit into three basic categories. He's a prophet, he's a priest, and he's a king.

And it behooves us to spend a month in which we basically take a survey of those three  aspects of his work. Now let me just put the whole thing in context for you for a moment. When I say that there's three things, everything that Jesus does, everything that he says  or does anywhere in the Bible can fall into one of those three categories. And those categories are used because they are so crucial. If you leave out any one of those three things, if you see him as two of those and not the  third, if you see him as one of those and not the third, it gives you a distortion.

It distorts your view of reality. It certainly gives you a concoction that's not Christianity and it's spiritually poisonous  if you take it into your system. Let me just give you a couple of examples. There's plenty of people, when we say prophet, priest, and king, by prophet, we mean he's  a revealer. He communicates truth.

He's the revealer of God. Who God is and what his will is, is a prophet. And secondly, he's a priest. That means he's a redeemer. He's a representative that is he comes to stand in our place.

You see, as a prophet, he comes actually representing God, but as a priest, he represents us. As a prophet, he comes and speaks to you and me for God. But as a priest, he comes and speaks to God the Father for us. He's our stand in. He died in our place.

You see, he brings us to God. He's our advocate. He's our representative. He's our redeemer. So first, he's a prophet, revealer.

Secondly, he's a priest, redeemer. And thirdly, he's a king, a ruler. He commands us. We owe him our utmost allegiance. He's the supreme authority in our lives.

So there he is, prophet, priest, and king, revealer, redeemer, and ruler. Now, let me just show you what happens if you leave any of them out. There are plenty of people that I have run into in New York. And I've been thinking a lot about this because I've been reading a book. I'll refer to it again.

It's called New York in the 50s by Dan Wakefield, who was a Columbia University student in the  early 50s and stayed in Grant Village, and became part of the beat generation in the Bohemian  scene. You know, it was a writer, and anyway, one of the things that I have noticed, I was reading  the book, and I realized that I've met so many people who've come to New York City from  Middle America. And out in Middle America, they had, in many cases, fairly orthodox kind of Christian upbringing. But they come to New York, and they completely leave it behind. They disdain the religion of their childhood along with the values of Middle-class  American, the values of the great homogeneous American, they dive into the intellectual  and cultural and ethnic diversity of New York, and they think of themselves as kind of  a superior race now to where they've come from.

And very often I'll talk to these folks, and you know who you are. And what they'll say is, you know, I don't go to church, and I pretty much have lived  the way I feel like I should be living, and I don't know what I believe anymore, really. But I know this, that when I was a little girl, when I was a little boy, I made a decision  for Christ, and I still somehow believe that he's really for me. I really somehow believe he's still with me. In other words, I've come here, and my feelings and my experience and my emotions are now  my king, and they also are my prophet.

In other words, I bring my own truth, I decide what truth was true for me, and I decide  how to live. But I still want the idea somehow of a Jesus who's a redeemer. I don't want him as a king, and I don't want him as a prophet. I don't want him to tell me what's true, and I don't want him to give me any commands. But somehow, I just like the idea that he loves me, and he forgives me, and he's always  with me.

All right? That's not Christianity. That's something, but it's not Christianity. You can't have Jesus with only as priest and not prophet or king. Only as a redeemer and not a revealer and ruler.

I'm Timothy James Keller, and if somebody says to me, come in, James, stay out, Timothy,  and Keller. I'll be in a pickle. I won't say, well, you know, I'm sort of a whole thing. I don't know what part of me is the James part, and maybe it's my left arm. Maybe you can have that.

It doesn't work that way. I'm all Timothy. I'm all James. I'm all Keller. And he's all prophet and all priest and all king.

He just can't have one piece of him. All right, let me, another example, but I'll be more brief, is there are plenty of groups. And I guess I'd say churches, but there's plenty of groups that love the idea of Jesus. They've really got a very developed view of Jesus as the king and the commander. But their understanding of him as being a redeemer, their understanding of him as being an advocate  is very underdeveloped.

And in those legalistic groups, you know, you're hit over the head with Jesus says, and  Jesus says, and Jesus says, it's very vivid. It's put across in a very imaginative and vivid way, but any discussion about his redemption  and about his grace and about his love is all an abstraction. Jesus is king. Without Jesus as prophet and priest is a terrible, terrible place to be. However, it's not really Jesus.

Or now, one more example, just as the legalistic groups like him as king and not as a priest  and just as like licentious people like him as priest, but they don't like the idea of him as king or revealer. So there's an awful lot of folks today. They didn't actually like the idea of Jesus as a prophet, but not as a priest in a king. In other words, they say, I believe Jesus was a great teacher. I believe he revealed to us a great deal about God.

But I just can't buy in this whole idea of him being a divine savior, a divine king, and so on. Now, one of the most famous, I'll just refer to it here, one of the most famous passages in all of modern Christian literature  has got to be that chapter in Mayor Christianity where C.S. Lewis points out that that's the one thing you can't believe  that he's only a prophet. He says the problem with this prophet was that Jesus Christ, the prophet, came and he said,  I'm God. You have to worship me.

I alone can forgive your sins. What you think of me will determine where you spend eternity. So this man comes along with all these unbelievable claims. The saying that he's God and saying that he's got to be the final authority in your life and so on,  and you are the stone on which he's the stone on which you will either rise or fall and so forth. So Lewis says something very obvious.

He says, if this is true that he claimed all these things, then he's either much more than a prophet or much less than a prophet,  but he can't just be a prophet. Either he's far more than a prophet because he claimed to be or else, he's crazy or he's a liar and he's a fool  and he's much less than a prophet, either he's more than a prophet or else we can't believe anything that he says. But the one thing he will not allow you to believe is that he's only a prophet and not a priest in a king. Don't you see, if you try to hold on to one, if you either have one or two and reject the others,  or if you even just have a grasp on one and a kind of vague understanding of the others,  it will introduce distortions into your life. In fact, in fact, I think that it would be possible, though I don't think I can go into it right now.

It would be possible for me to create a grid, for myself as a pastor to help people understand what's wrong with their Christian lives. I'm talking about Christians here. I think in most cases, if we look at our Christian lives and we say, what's wrong, where do we need to grow? Where do we have stress fractures in our Christian life? Where is there crumbling, where is there deterioration, where is there weakness?

Ordinarily, you'll be able to do it by looking at this grid. Very often, we're really good. We have a good grasp on Jesus as one of these things and on Jesus as one of the others. Some of you are really great into the Bible study. The idea of Jesus' prophets great.

You love to study his teachings, and you know very, very well,  and yet you're not being obedient to him as king. Some of you are being very, very obedient to him as king, and yet you're just full of guilt and anxiety  and burdened and you're burdened down with a horrible view of yourselves,  because you just really don't have a good grasp of Jesus as redeemer and priest. Don't just say, you know, these three things,  that's why we're spending a couple of weeks on each, a couple of sermons on each. He's the prophet, he's the priest, he's the king. Now, having said that, and I just sort of set the context for the entire month,  tonight, I would like to say, even though he's far more than a prophet, he is a prophet,  and what does that mean?

Let me read, believe it or not, have a scripture text, yes. Let me read from Acts chapter three, verse 17 to 26. Now, I just gave you the introduction to the month. Now, Acts chapter three, verse 17 to 26,  read it, and there's two basic things that we want to draw out of this,  that tells you something about Jesus as the great and ultimate prophet and revealer of God to us. In Acts three, it reads, start in verse 17, this is Peter preaching.

He says, now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance as did your leaders,  but this is how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets,  saying that his Christ would suffer, repent then, and turn to God,  so that your sins may be wiped out, and that times of refreshing may come from the Lord,  and that he may send the Christ, who has been appointed for you, even Jesus. He must remain in heaven until the time comes for God to restore everything,  as he promised long ago through his holy prophets. For G-Moses said, the Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me  from among your own people. You must listen to everything he tells you. Anyone who does not listen to him will be completely cut off from among his people.

Indeed, all the prophets from Samuel on, as many as have spoken, have foretold these days,  and you are heirs of the prophets and of the covenant God made with your fathers. He said to Abraham, though your offspring through your offspring,  all peoples on earth will be blessed, and when God raised up his servant,  he sent him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways. Now, what do we see here? First of all, we see the obvious, and that is that Jesus Christ is a  prophet. It says, Peter says, Moses had prophesied, the Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet  like unto me, said Moses.

From among your own people, you must listen to everything he tells you. Anyone who does not listen to him will be completely cut off. Now, what Moses is saying is, you think I was a good prophet, there is a prophet to come  to beat all prophets. He will be like me, and yet he will be so supreme in his authority,  so seminal in his authority and his truth, that your relation to him  will completely determine whether or not you're accepted or cut off. So, and Peter says, this is Jesus.

Jesus is the one who's coming. And, you know, what does it teach us? All right, first of all, the fact that Jesus is a prophet,  not just a priest in a king, but a prophet, shows us that we have a God who speaks to us. Now, I want you to know that ever, ever since, the beginning of time, it seems like  human beings have wanted desperately to have a universe to talk to them, to have a universe to  talk back to them. If you read our literature and you look at our songs from the very beginning,  we have been always imagining talking trees and talking animals.

And even in our science fiction,  we imagine other races, you know, from other planets, we're desperately afraid of the idea that  maybe we're the only speakers in the world. But maybe it's an impersonal and silent universe. Maybe at bottom there's nobody to talk to. There's no rational, there's no rational other. And the Bible says that's not true.

The reason you believe that there is, the reason you want  so desperately to have someone else to talk to is because there is. One of the things I loved  about Leonard Bernstein was he said, you know, I don't believe the Bible, I don't believe that  sort of thing. And yet, remember, he says, when I listen to Beethoven, remember the great quote,  I don't, that's why I'm reading it. He says, when I listen to Beethoven, he says, Beethoven  leaves us with a feeling that something is right in the world, that something checks  throughout, that something follows its own laws consistently, something we can trust,  something that will never let us down. In other words, he says, you know, I don't believe in  absolute truth.

I don't believe an internal body of truth that's internally coherent,  that's absolutely consistent to its own inner laws, that's something that we can trust that will  never let us down, that checks throughout. And yet, when I hear Beethoven, I feel like it must  exist. And the Bible says, the reason that you want to believe in talking trees, the reason you  want to believe there's a universe out there to talk to you, there's a rational center that can  talk back to us is because there is. The reason that you, even when you intellectually, say,  I reject the whole idea of absolute truth, I reject the idea of a guy who speaks to us,  when I talk, when I listen to Beethoven, I know how that there's something else,  that we're not all alone, rational in an irrational universe, personal in an impersonal  universe, speakers in a silent universe. I can't believe that.

Well, the Bible says the reason  you can't believe it, the reason that you want to believe it, where did you get the idea? It's  because it's true, because you know it, because there is a God who speaks, and he speaks to Jesus,  when Jesus was transfigured, remember the transfiguration on the mount of transfiguration,  the apostles who were there saw Jesus, and they saw Moses on the one side, and Elijah on the  other, prophets, and Jesus standing in the middle. And a voice came down from heaven, remember what it  said? This is my son, says God, hear ye him. Hear ye him.

You cannot relate to Jesus Christ as  some kind of mystical figure. He is a teacher, he is a prophet, he brings truth, and you have to  your relationship with the Father is through a prophet, and that means that your relationship with  God is not just a mystical kind of oneness, it is a relationship based on communication and an  acceptance of that communication. It's rational, it's orderly, there's a body of truth that this  prophet brings, and that's the basis of your relationship. You can't just commune with God by going  out into beautiful spots, you know, of nature, and just kind of feeling his presence. That's not  the way you relate to God as a Father.

This is my beloved son, hear ye him. He's a prophet. Now,  the two things I just like to talk about, just the two aspects, is what it means, what a prophet is,  anyway, what does the Bible mean when it talks about prophets? So first of all, what are prophets,  and then secondly, why is Jesus the ultimate prophet? Why is he the final?

I'll show you, the  Bible teaches, he's the final prophet. That's a big difference between Christianity and other religions. Islam will tell you Jesus was a prophet, but they will not grant that he was the final prophet. And there's a lot of other religions that will say Jesus was a prophet, but they will not grant  that he was the final prophet. That's the place where Christianity diverges from others.

They say that Jesus Christ reveals God in an unsurpassable way and brings a disclosure of God  that can't be topped. And here's the reasons why. But anyway, let's take a look, these two things. What are prophets? What does the Bible teach us about prophets and why is Jesus the ultimate prophet?

Number one, what are prophets? You see, it says in the word is mentioned a number of times in the  passage. Jesus is the prophet that Moses was talking about, but it also tells us a great deal about  what prophets did. Look, in verse 18, if you have something to look at, it says, this is how God  fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets. Now you see, if you want to know what a  prophet is, a prophet is a mouthpiece for God.

God foretold these things through the prophets,  doesn't say the prophets foretold. Sometimes it does, but it tells us that whatever the prophet says is  what God says. Now if you want the best definition, biblical definition of prophecy and what a  prophet is, you can go back to an interesting place where Moses is being told by God to go and speak  to Pharaoh. And Moses says, you don't understand. I'm very inarticulate.

I don't like crowds. I get scared  when I get up on a platform. I can't take it. So what does God say? He says, fine.

Aaron's better than  it, you know, it's speaking to you. So he says, quote, this is an Exodus 7, I will make you like God  to Pharaoh and Aaron, like a prophet to you. So whatever you say, Aaron will say. See, now modern people don't believe what the Bible says about prophecy. Modern people will say,  okay, here are the prophets and they have written what the Bible says, the prophets have written,  there's Isaiah and here's Hosea and here's Obadaya and here's all these prophets.

Well, how do we  regard them? We say those are men who have interpreted, they have interpreted, they're giving us  their interpretation of who God is. And that's great. We might learn from them, but of course,  we all have the right to make our own interpretations about what God has said too. And so the idea is  sort of like this.

Let's just say Shostakovich has written a new symphony, but I don't think he can,  isn't he dead? But anyway, but let's just say he has, he's dead, or if he's not dead, he's certainly  probably not writing any symphonies anymore. So you are a critic for the paper and you go  to hear this symphony and you listen and you're all done, you sit down, you write your column and  you say, well, you know, I think that the first, I think that the first movement is a man in bondage,  yes, a man in slavery. And I think the second movement is a man in liberation, a man liberating  himself from bondage. And so you write this down and so on.

And that's how many people say we  should understand prophets. Prophets are people who wrote in the Bible like Isaiah and Hosea and  people like that. And they wrote down their interpretation. They say, well, I think God is like this  and I think God is like that. Well, everybody has a right to their own interpretation, right?

However, what if you ask Shostakovich to write the review of his symphony for the paper? And you said, Mr. Shostakovich, tell us, what were you trying to say in the first movement? What were you trying to say in the second movement? And he writes it down.

And you see,  that's a very different thing than when the critic interprets it. Here you have the author saying  something and it kind of gets rid of the whole idea. You know, if you're, how can you debate  what Shostakovich had in his mind when he wrote the first movement of that symphony? You can't debate  it over. We have it right from his mouth now.

Do we understand when the prophets  write something in the Bible? Should we understand it as a critic interpreting what the composer  meant? Or do we interpret really as nothing more than the very ideas and words of the composer  simply through the mouthpiece of the prophet? And the Bible says very clearly, it says, especially  in 2 Peter, chapter 1, verse 13, no prophecy of Scripture is by the prophet's own interpretation,  but prophets spoke from God not of their own will as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. Period.

You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger brother. In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who try to  earn his love by being good. In his book The prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known  story reveals the heart of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother  and the judgmental older brother, and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal,  extravagant grace. Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith,  The prodigal God will help you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way. The prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the  hope and joy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the world.

This idea of truth is utterly repugnant to the modern mind, and we're modern people and we live  in a modern community, maybe the most modern city anywhere. And yet that's what it means when  the Bible says Jesus was a prophet, and that's what it means when it says the Bible is a word of  prophecy.

Prophets are simply bringing you the very words of God. That's why it says there in verse  he foretold through the prophets. What the prophets say? God says. And therefore the idea of truth  is in Christianity is this is objective truth.

This is not an interpretation of what God thinks. This is what God thinks. It's possible to know what God thinks. Well, I tell you, it's so easy for  for people to say the idea that you can know what God thinks. Who do you think you are?

Christians are often told this. You think you know what God thinks. Who do you think you are? And the only thing you can say at some point is yes, I do believe that our God is knowable. I do believe that our God speaks.

I do believe that our God is not a hidden God. I do believe that our God is not hiding from us. You do. That's the difference. It's not a matter of pride.

I think you can know what God thinks about certain things. Because I believe there's a God who speaks. Not just the God who's out there, not just the God who's  out there, but a God who speaks. Now, Christians will always find when they come to understand this view  of prophetic truth that that God has spoken, that God gives us objective truth. You're going to find that there's two very different alternate worldviews really competing  with Christianity in a city like New York.

Every so often, you know, I mention these two  basic competing worldviews and unfortunately, every time I give them different names, so a lot of you  probably think there's seven or eight. But the two of them are, you know, let me give you all  the different names. The one is sometimes people, sometimes we call it naturalism because it's the  view that nature is all there is. Sometimes we call it secularism that says, you know, there's nothing,  there's no spirit, there's no supernatural. All we have is what is matter.

All that's all. And on the other hand, besides naturalism or secular scientism, you've got pantheism. Pantheism, which means God is in everything. I also sometimes call it new ageism. Confuses everybody.

And they seem very different. The one view says there is no God. Nothing is God. The other view says everything is God. God is a force in all of us.

And therefore, the first view says there's really no truth, only facts. We know scientific facts,  but there's no truth. There's no reality. You see, there's no ultimate reality. Bertrand Russell  says, when the universe dies, all the civilization will go.

So there's no right and wrong. There is  no spirit. There is no purpose or meaning in life. And he says, only if you build your life  on the knowledge of that. Only if you build your life on, he says, the foundations of unhealing  despair will you be safe.

Don't believe any humbug about there being meaning. Don't believe  any humbug that there's right and wrong. We're just made of molecules, period. That's the one view. The other view says, oh, no, God is in everything.

In fact, you are God. And what it says is,  we have to alter our consciousness, move into a new state of consciousness, and look inside of  ourselves to get in touch with our own greatness, our own potential, our own creativity. Now, they sound very different and very often they hate each other and they have fights on  cable television. They fight with each other. You see, the one group, you know, one group it believes,  it's funny.

The one group believes nothing and the other group believes everything. The one group believes in nothing and the other group says, what, to row cards, you know, crystal balls,  channeling, you know, and you know, worshiping nature, yeah, yeah, you know, everything. One group believes in nothing, one group believes in everything. One group says there is no God,  one group says everything is God. And they seem very different.

But here's where they  in practice, in practice, it comes out of the same thing. They both come down to this. You are  your own truth finder. You are your own truth bringer. On the one hand, you see a Bertrand Russell will say, you decide how you want to live.

There's no  right and wrong. On the other side, they say, well, you have to look into yourself and find out  what you really are and who you really are. But when it comes right down to it, in both cases,  there's no truth outside that we have to submit to. You're your own truth finder, you're your own  truth bringer. And I, listen, the one view sounds so noble.

You know, they say to us, they say to  Christians, yes, if you need a belief in God to face the meaninglessness and despair of life, well,  okay, you know, you, they seem, it seems so noble. It seems so, you know, they seem so strong  and courageous. On the other hand, the pantheistic, the new ageistic people, they seem so exotic. So positive, so profound, you see. But I would suggest that there are some very crass motives  that people have to reject the Christian idea of truth because at the very bottom, there is a  childish side of us that doesn't want anybody to tell us what to do.

And as intellectual and as  noble and as positive as profound as it sounds, it plays right into those crass motives, right into  the hands of those crass motives. The book I was reading by Dan Wakefield called New York in the  50s. Dan Wakefield was a guy from the Midwest and he came to Columbia University and he started  reading the existentialist and he began to realize that the universe was a cosmos was meaningless  and that existence was absurd and everybody had to find their own truth, you know. And so he went  down into the village and he began to live any old way he wanted. And he said, you know, he would  get his friends would come from Indiana.

One time he had a woman come from Indiana and they spent  a couple weeks with him and said, she says, Danny, New York is so intellectual. New York is so  sophisticated, so anonymous, I don't know what's in to commit first. And he said, you know, really  what New York gave us was an intellectual construct to justify doing all the things our parents  back in Indiana would never let us do. And so people, a lot of people say, oh, you know,  Christians, you've got motives for wanting to believe in Christ. You've got motives for wanting  to believe that the Bible is really the word of God.

You want authority in your life. You want  certainty in your life. Yeah, sure. That's true. So there's motives there.

What about your motives  for rejecting the concept of truth? You see, you've got tremendous motives. People come,  especially college kids, they just love either to buy into naturalism or pantheism. Why? Because now  I can do all the things my parents would never let me do.

Finally, I can do whatever I want. There's nothing more crash in that and there's nothing more childish than that. Put it this way, your eight year old comes home having played baseball. And he says to you, boy,  I got into kind of a fight. Why, honey?

Well, I was rounding third and this boy tripped me. Well, what did you do? I got up, I grabbed a big rock and I threw it as hard as I could  write it as head and it just missed him. He got very upset and we had a fight. So you say,  son, that was absolutely and totally wrong.

What he did was wrong, but what you did, you could have  killed him. It was disproportionate. It was all out of proportion. It was wrong, always wrong. It's how you're going to ruin your life if you have a contemporary like that.

You're going to  ruin your life if you think you can respond like that. So what does your son say? You weren't there. You don't know. Who do you think you are to tell me what to do?

I mean, that's the way the heart works,  you see. That's the essence of the heart. So what do you say to the kid? You say, I'm 40, you're eight. I am from above.

You are from below. I can see things that you can't see. Absolutely serious. I know it's funny. It is funny.

You can laugh, but it's totally serious. You say to the kid,  I can see life from a vantage point that you can't even imagine. And therefore, unless you hear  my word, if you reject my word, your life will be a wreck. In John chapter 8, Jesus says, I am  the light of the world and everything that I say is true. And if you reject my truth, you will  die in your sins.

And it says here, what does it say? It says, the Lord your God will raise up for  you a prophet, but this prophet will be different than all other prophets. This prophet will not be from  below. This prophet will be from above. And because he's from above, if you don't listen to him,  you will be completely cut off.

So what are we saying? The first point, and there's only two points. Don't worry. The first point, the Bible says that there is objective truth, that Jesus Christ  brings it, but all the prophets brought it. Now we're going to see in a minute why Jesus Christ is  the ultimate bringer of truth, but the prophets bring a truth which trumps all other sources of  information.

See, the other worldviews hate that idea. They say, well, we're all on competition. Oh, Isaiah, they have an interpretation of God, but so does Shakespeare, so does my English teacher,  so do I. Everybody has their own interpretation. The Bible says, no, there are some people who have  spoken that are prophets, and they bring a truth which is from above.

And therefore that truth  trumps all other truth, all other source of information. You've got your heart motions, right? You've got expert opinion, you've got your traditions that you were raised in, and you've got public  opinion. Jesus' truth, God's truth trumps all other kinds of truth. If it differs with public  opinion, you have to follow it.

If it differs with your feelings, you have to follow it. That's the  nature of truth. That's the nature of, that's what it means when the Bible says that there are  prophets, that God has sent prophets, though you've murdered the prophets, when I sent them to you,  he says, I will keep sending them to you because they bring the truth. You don't like the idea of  a truth that trumps you, but it does. Now, one more thing about this.

I know that what I said  sounds very harsh. The doctrine of God's truth, the idea of God's truth, the Bible gives us,  it's hard, it's unyielding, it's got sharp edges to it, it's like chewing on a diamond,  I know that. And yet, what about Beethoven? We hate the idea that there is truth that no matter  how much we want to do this, we're not allowed. That no matter how much we don't want to do this,  we have to.

That idea, we just hate it. That's why we love to jump into the existentialists. We  love to jump into the New Age, we love to jump into complete skepticism about any truth at all,  you see. We just love that idea. We hate the idea of it being a prophet.

I know it sounds very  harsh, but what are you going to do about Beethoven? Because you see, Pascal puts it this way,  just as we have an incapacity for proving anything which no amount of dogmatism can overcome. Hear that? He says, on the one hand, we really can't prove anything. Nobody can prove anything.

He says, on the one hand, we have an incapacity for proving anything which no amount of dogmatism  can overcome yet. He says, we have a concept of the truth which no amount of skepticism can overcome. What I'm trying to say is, you look at the people, and maybe I know some of you are these people. Look at the people who say, ah, there is no truth, like Bertrand Russell. And look at the people  who say, well, truth is found within.

Look at the people who say there's no such thing as objective  truth. And yet, every human being, every human being has a concept of truth that no amount of  skepticism can overcome. We all know that some things are right or wrong regardless of what people  believed. Isn't that right? Some things are just wrong, we say.

But if you don't believe in a God  who speaks through the prophets, you've got no basis for that. You've got no basis for believing it. And you can't help but believe it. You know there's a truth. You know there's a God who speaks.

Okay. So first, we learn that God speaks through the prophets. But lastly, we also learn in this  passage that Jesus is the ultimate prophet. He's the final revealer of the truth. Why?

You see,  notice, even though he's a prophet, it tells us that he is what all the prophets were speaking of. It says, this is how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, saying his  Christ would suffer. Repent then and turn to God so that your sins may be wiped out. In other words,  Jesus Christ is not only the subject of prophecy. He's the object of prophecy.

He not only brings  the truth, but he is the truth to which all the prophets have always been pointing. And that means  what makes him different and all your prophets is simple. He is not just the one who brings the truth. He is the truth. Buddha, Mohammed, and Moses, and Abraham, all of them come and here's what they  say.

They say, don't look at me. I am pointing to God. I'm pointing to the way to God. Don't look at me. So I am nothing in myself.

I am pointing to him. Jesus is the first prophet who comes along saying,  I am pointing to me. You can only find God through me. I am the way, the truth, the life. No one  comes to the Father, but by me.

And it says in Hebrews chapter 1, verse 1, it's astonishing thing. It says, in the past, God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets in many times and in many ways. But now he has spoken to us by his son, who is the radiance of God's glory and the exact  representation of his being. That's just, you know, there is no parallel for such a statement. It says, why all other prophets, what they told us was piecemeal, every other prophet who has  ever lived.

In fact, I could even go so far and say, every other prophet of any other religion  comes and tells us true things. You know, they would never have gotten off the ground. I'm not  saying, Muhammad says plenty of true things. Buddhist is plenty of true things. They have to,  you know, you do not get a religion off the ground unless there's a lot of truth in it, an awful lot.

But Jesus is the only one who comes not saying pointing over his shoulder but pointing to his own  heart. He's the one that comes and says, they can tell you a lot about God, but I can show you God. So I am the ultimate revealer. Why? Because all other prophets give us pieces of the truth in many  ways and many places we heard, but now God has spoken in this final way.

Why is it unsurpassed? Because he is the very radiance of his glory and the exact representation of his being. And that's the reason why we have to say, how could anyone come after Jesus and add anything? How could he? Unless there's a fourth person to the Trinity and then it wouldn't be a Trinity,  you see?

No, there are been prophets, you know, Muhammad came along afterwards that Jesus is a  prophet, but I trump him. I'm the ultimate. I bring a higher view. I bring a better view. Baha'u'la said the same thing.

People have been doing it all the 20th century. The only way you could really get away with that rationally is to say, I am God. In fact,  I'm a better, I'm a bigger, I'm a better manifestation of the radiance of God's glory,  and I'm a more exact representation of his being than Jesus. Nobody has ever dared make such a claim  except people who are lunatics. Why?

You can't get away with it unless you are a heck of a moral,  glorious character. You better be unbelievably great person. Your wisdom and your beauty and  your attractiveness and your compassion and your absolute consistency. Only Jesus has ever been  able to claim that and get away with it because only Jesus had the life to match his claim. And  therefore, he is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being.

And let me conclude by saying, he is not just a prophet because as God, he shows us who God is  because he's so compassionate and loving in the way in which he talks and acts and moves. No, ultimately, Jesus is the ultimate revealer. Well, this is what's so great about why you can't  move Prophet Priest and King away from each other. He is the ultimate prophet because he's the priest  and the king. On the cross, listen.

Other prophets have told us, haven't they? That God is holy. Other prophets have told us, haven't they? That God is love. Prophets, in all religions, have come and said, God is holy.

He is just. He hates evil. He hates sin,  right? And all the prophets have come and said, God is loving. God is compassionate.

And Jesus  was no different. He came and he said, God hates sin. He also came and said, God loves you. And he told the parable, the prodigal son. And he showed how when we come back to God, the father  is so eager to have us back that he comes rushing to us before we can even get half of our repentance  out of our mouth.

He leaps on us and he kisses our neck. Now, Jesus, like a prophet, told us those  things. But Jesus, because he's a priest, is the ultimate prophet, because on the cross, he shows  in a way that no prophet ever has or ever could. He reveals in a way that no prophet ever has or  ever could. The absolute glory of God, because he reconciles the holiness and love of God on the cross.

The one place in history, the one place in the universe, where the holiness and the love of God  shine out with equal brightness is on the cross. Because when you understand the logic of the cross,  Jesus died for you. So the more God poured out his wrath on sin, the more he saved us. On the cross and only on the cross, God is both just and justifier of those who believe. Only there is God's heart, his essence revealed.

Only the true glory of God. There is no other  religion. There is no other prophet. There's no other place anywhere that shows us that like that. Why?

Because you say Jesus is more than a prophet. And that's why he's the ultimate prophet. And I tell you that if you follow any other prophet and make any other prophet supreme, any other  source of truth supreme over Jesus, you will either see the holiness of God or the love of God,  but you'll never see them together. Never. You'll either be either a legalistic person or lie  sensuous person.

You will be an unbalanced person, but you'll never hold it all together. You'll never see how they, the righteousness and the love of God, kiss and embrace and weep and  fall on each other's neck, so that God can weep and fall on your neck. Only this prophet says to  the woman caught in adultery, I don't condemn thee, but yet he says go and send no more. How can he  do both? The cross.

Only he do here do we have God, God who is just and justifier. It's  unsurpassed. It's unbelievable. Look into the face of this prophet. Look into the face of this  God, of this of this prophet, Jesus Christ, and you will see the face of the Father.

Is he? Listen, Jesus says, this is my beloved son, here ye him. Let me ask you to conclude. Do you? Do you just hope that Jesus will kind of love you, but you don't want to study his teaching,  master his teaching?

You really don't like the idea that he has the right to tell you what to do? I tell you something. Do you want him to redeem you? Do you want him to love you? Do you want him to open away to the Father?

You have to hear him. You have to listen to him. You've got to let his hard, unyielding objective truth into your life. Are you willing to do that? Because he's all of these things or he's none of these things, but because he's all of these things,  he shows us the Father.

He's the absolute representation, exact representation of his being  and the radiance of his glory. Let's pray. Father, we thank you that all this is for us,  we thank you that because Jesus Christ came and died, you can look at our sin and yet fall on our  neck and say, put on my robe, put on my ring, let's kill the fatted calf, let's dance and sing  for your mind, your home. Father, when we see Jesus Christ and only when we see Jesus Christ,  are we able to really see you, only he reveals you, only he does. Thank you for the uniqueness,  thank you for the supremacy of his revelation of your being and of your radiance and of your glory.

We pray that tonight, the two things we might learn is that we need to study the Bible,  we need to study, here's the scripture, we need to know it inside out. But on the other hand, that your son, Jesus Christ, is the supreme and ultimate prophet  and his truth trumps all of the truths and the picture that he gives us of you is the supreme  picture that's possible. We thank you for this great disclosure and we ask that you would help  us to take it in to our own lives and be changed by it. No one knows the Father except the Son  and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him. In Jesus name we pray, amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today's podcast where Tim Keller explores the person and promises of Jesus  Christ. Every January and June, the pastors get together and we do a short series together on some  theme or subject. And what we're doing here in the month of January, and actually, if you want to see  how the subject's divided and how all the assignments have been divvied out, you can  find that on the very back page of the bullet and tells you what we're doing in January. After speaking about, we're talking about how to understand Jesus. Now that means that somebody might say, but aren't you always talking about how to understand  Jesus?

And the answer is every so often, it's a good idea to give people a helicopter ride in  a comprehensive way a look at the biblical doctrine of Christ. The biblical doctrine of Christ means a look at all the various facets of what the Bible  teaches about Jesus. The Bible teaches us about Jesus person. He is human and he's divine. And in the Scott last week, in the morning evening service dealt with that.

And it's very, very important, as certain points, to take a look at the two sides of what  the Bible teaches about Christ's percentage. Because if you only see him as human and not divine or only see him as divine and not human,  you get into some tremendous trouble and you have a distortion of what it's not Christianity,  whatever you come up with, it's not Christianity unless you keep that together. And the Bible, besides teaching those two great things about his person, the Bible teaches  three great things about his work. All of the things the Bible tells us that he has done, fit into three basic categories. He's a prophet, he's a priest, and he's a king.

And it behooves us to spend a month in which we basically take a survey of those three  aspects of his work. Now let me just put the whole thing in context for you for a moment. When I say that there's three things, everything that Jesus does, everything that he says  or does anywhere in the Bible can fall into one of those three categories. And those categories are used because they are so crucial. If you leave out any one of those three things, if you see him as two of those and not the  third, if you see him as one of those and not the third, it gives you a distortion.

It distorts your view of reality. It certainly gives you a concoction that's not Christianity and it's spiritually poisonous  if you take it into your system. Let me just give you a couple of examples. There's plenty of people, when we say prophet, priest, and king, by prophet, we mean he's  a revealer. He communicates truth.

He's the revealer of God. Who God is and what his will is, is a prophet. And secondly, he's a priest. That means he's a redeemer. He's a representative that is he comes to stand in our place.

You see, as a prophet, he comes actually representing God, but as a priest, he represents us. As a prophet, he comes and speaks to you and me for God. But as a priest, he comes and speaks to God the Father for us. He's our stand in. He died in our place.

You see, he brings us to God. He's our advocate. He's our representative. He's our redeemer. So first, he's a prophet, revealer.

Secondly, he's a priest, redeemer. And thirdly, he's a king, a ruler. He commands us. We owe him our utmost allegiance. He's the supreme authority in our lives.

So there he is, prophet, priest, and king, revealer, redeemer, and ruler. Now, let me just show you what happens if you leave any of them out. There are plenty of people that I have run into in New York. And I've been thinking a lot about this because I've been reading a book. I'll refer to it again.

It's called New York in the 50s by Dan Wakefield, who was a Columbia University student in the  early 50s and stayed in Grant Village, and became part of the beat generation in the Bohemian  scene. You know, it was a writer, and anyway, one of the things that I have noticed, I was reading  the book, and I realized that I've met so many people who've come to New York City from  Middle America. And out in Middle America, they had, in many cases, fairly orthodox kind of Christian upbringing. But they come to New York, and they completely leave it behind. They disdain the religion of their childhood along with the values of Middle-class  American, the values of the great homogeneous American, they dive into the intellectual  and cultural and ethnic diversity of New York, and they think of themselves as kind of  a superior race now to where they've come from.

And very often I'll talk to these folks, and you know who you are. And what they'll say is, you know, I don't go to church, and I pretty much have lived  the way I feel like I should be living, and I don't know what I believe anymore, really. But I know this, that when I was a little girl, when I was a little boy, I made a decision  for Christ, and I still somehow believe that he's really for me. I really somehow believe he's still with me. In other words, I've come here, and my feelings and my experience and my emotions are now  my king, and they also are my prophet.

In other words, I bring my own truth, I decide what truth was true for me, and I decide  how to live. But I still want the idea somehow of a Jesus who's a redeemer. I don't want him as a king, and I don't want him as a prophet. I don't want him to tell me what's true, and I don't want him to give me any commands. But somehow, I just like the idea that he loves me, and he forgives me, and he's always  with me.

All right? That's not Christianity. That's something, but it's not Christianity. You can't have Jesus with only as priest and not prophet or king. Only as a redeemer and not a revealer and ruler.

I'm Timothy James Keller, and if somebody says to me, come in, James, stay out, Timothy,  and Keller. I'll be in a pickle. I won't say, well, you know, I'm sort of a whole thing. I don't know what part of me is the James part, and maybe it's my left arm. Maybe you can have that.

It doesn't work that way. I'm all Timothy. I'm all James. I'm all Keller. And he's all prophet and all priest and all king.

He just can't have one piece of him. All right, let me, another example, but I'll be more brief, is there are plenty of groups. And I guess I'd say churches, but there's plenty of groups that love the idea of Jesus. They've really got a very developed view of Jesus as the king and the commander. But their understanding of him as being a redeemer, their understanding of him as being an advocate  is very underdeveloped.

And in those legalistic groups, you know, you're hit over the head with Jesus says, and  Jesus says, and Jesus says, it's very vivid. It's put across in a very imaginative and vivid way, but any discussion about his redemption  and about his grace and about his love is all an abstraction. Jesus is king. Without Jesus as prophet and priest is a terrible, terrible place to be. However, it's not really Jesus.

Or now, one more example, just as the legalistic groups like him as king and not as a priest  and just as like licentious people like him as priest, but they don't like the idea of him as king or revealer. So there's an awful lot of folks today. They didn't actually like the idea of Jesus as a prophet, but not as a priest in a king. In other words, they say, I believe Jesus was a great teacher. I believe he revealed to us a great deal about God.

But I just can't buy in this whole idea of him being a divine savior, a divine king, and so on. Now, one of the most famous, I'll just refer to it here, one of the most famous passages in all of modern Christian literature  has got to be that chapter in Mayor Christianity where C.S. Lewis points out that that's the one thing you can't believe  that he's only a prophet. He says the problem with this prophet was that Jesus Christ, the prophet, came and he said,  I'm God. You have to worship me.

I alone can forgive your sins. What you think of me will determine where you spend eternity. So this man comes along with all these unbelievable claims. The saying that he's God and saying that he's got to be the final authority in your life and so on,  and you are the stone on which he's the stone on which you will either rise or fall and so forth. So Lewis says something very obvious.

He says, if this is true that he claimed all these things, then he's either much more than a prophet or much less than a prophet,  but he can't just be a prophet. Either he's far more than a prophet because he claimed to be or else, he's crazy or he's a liar and he's a fool  and he's much less than a prophet, either he's more than a prophet or else we can't believe anything that he says. But the one thing he will not allow you to believe is that he's only a prophet and not a priest in a king. Don't you see, if you try to hold on to one, if you either have one or two and reject the others,  or if you even just have a grasp on one and a kind of vague understanding of the others,  it will introduce distortions into your life. In fact, in fact, I think that it would be possible, though I don't think I can go into it right now.

It would be possible for me to create a grid, for myself as a pastor to help people understand what's wrong with their Christian lives. I'm talking about Christians here. I think in most cases, if we look at our Christian lives and we say, what's wrong, where do we need to grow? Where do we have stress fractures in our Christian life? Where is there crumbling, where is there deterioration, where is there weakness?

Ordinarily, you'll be able to do it by looking at this grid. Very often, we're really good. We have a good grasp on Jesus as one of these things and on Jesus as one of the others. Some of you are really great into the Bible study. The idea of Jesus' prophets great.

You love to study his teachings, and you know very, very well,  and yet you're not being obedient to him as king. Some of you are being very, very obedient to him as king, and yet you're just full of guilt and anxiety  and burdened and you're burdened down with a horrible view of yourselves,  because you just really don't have a good grasp of Jesus as redeemer and priest. Don't just say, you know, these three things,  that's why we're spending a couple of weeks on each, a couple of sermons on each. He's the prophet, he's the priest, he's the king. Now, having said that, and I just sort of set the context for the entire month,  tonight, I would like to say, even though he's far more than a prophet, he is a prophet,  and what does that mean?

Let me read, believe it or not, have a scripture text, yes. Let me read from Acts chapter three, verse 17 to 26. Now, I just gave you the introduction to the month. Now, Acts chapter three, verse 17 to 26,  read it, and there's two basic things that we want to draw out of this,  that tells you something about Jesus as the great and ultimate prophet and revealer of God to us. In Acts three, it reads, start in verse 17, this is Peter preaching.

He says, now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance as did your leaders,  but this is how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets,  saying that his Christ would suffer, repent then, and turn to God,  so that your sins may be wiped out, and that times of refreshing may come from the Lord,  and that he may send the Christ, who has been appointed for you, even Jesus. He must remain in heaven until the time comes for God to restore everything,  as he promised long ago through his holy prophets. For G-Moses said, the Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me  from among your own people. You must listen to everything he tells you. Anyone who does not listen to him will be completely cut off from among his people.

Indeed, all the prophets from Samuel on, as many as have spoken, have foretold these days,  and you are heirs of the prophets and of the covenant God made with your fathers. He said to Abraham, though your offspring through your offspring,  all peoples on earth will be blessed, and when God raised up his servant,  he sent him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways. Now, what do we see here? First of all, we see the obvious, and that is that Jesus Christ is a  prophet. It says, Peter says, Moses had prophesied, the Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet  like unto me, said Moses.

From among your own people, you must listen to everything he tells you. Anyone who does not listen to him will be completely cut off. Now, what Moses is saying is, you think I was a good prophet, there is a prophet to come  to beat all prophets. He will be like me, and yet he will be so supreme in his authority,  so seminal in his authority and his truth, that your relation to him  will completely determine whether or not you're accepted or cut off. So, and Peter says, this is Jesus.

Jesus is the one who's coming. And, you know, what does it teach us? All right, first of all, the fact that Jesus is a prophet,  not just a priest in a king, but a prophet, shows us that we have a God who speaks to us. Now, I want you to know that ever, ever since, the beginning of time, it seems like  human beings have wanted desperately to have a universe to talk to them, to have a universe to  talk back to them. If you read our literature and you look at our songs from the very beginning,  we have been always imagining talking trees and talking animals.

And even in our science fiction,  we imagine other races, you know, from other planets, we're desperately afraid of the idea that  maybe we're the only speakers in the world. But maybe it's an impersonal and silent universe. Maybe at bottom there's nobody to talk to. There's no rational, there's no rational other. And the Bible says that's not true.

The reason you believe that there is, the reason you want  so desperately to have someone else to talk to is because there is. One of the things I loved  about Leonard Bernstein was he said, you know, I don't believe the Bible, I don't believe that  sort of thing. And yet, remember, he says, when I listen to Beethoven, remember the great quote,  I don't, that's why I'm reading it. He says, when I listen to Beethoven, he says, Beethoven  leaves us with a feeling that something is right in the world, that something checks  throughout, that something follows its own laws consistently, something we can trust,  something that will never let us down. In other words, he says, you know, I don't believe in  absolute truth.

I don't believe an internal body of truth that's internally coherent,  that's absolutely consistent to its own inner laws, that's something that we can trust that will  never let us down, that checks throughout. And yet, when I hear Beethoven, I feel like it must  exist. And the Bible says, the reason that you want to believe in talking trees, the reason you  want to believe there's a universe out there to talk to you, there's a rational center that can  talk back to us is because there is. The reason that you, even when you intellectually, say,  I reject the whole idea of absolute truth, I reject the idea of a guy who speaks to us,  when I talk, when I listen to Beethoven, I know how that there's something else,  that we're not all alone, rational in an irrational universe, personal in an impersonal  universe, speakers in a silent universe. I can't believe that.

Well, the Bible says the reason  you can't believe it, the reason that you want to believe it, where did you get the idea? It's  because it's true, because you know it, because there is a God who speaks, and he speaks to Jesus,  when Jesus was transfigured, remember the transfiguration on the mount of transfiguration,  the apostles who were there saw Jesus, and they saw Moses on the one side, and Elijah on the  other, prophets, and Jesus standing in the middle. And a voice came down from heaven, remember what it  said? This is my son, says God, hear ye him. Hear ye him.

You cannot relate to Jesus Christ as  some kind of mystical figure. He is a teacher, he is a prophet, he brings truth, and you have to  your relationship with the Father is through a prophet, and that means that your relationship with  God is not just a mystical kind of oneness, it is a relationship based on communication and an  acceptance of that communication. It's rational, it's orderly, there's a body of truth that this  prophet brings, and that's the basis of your relationship. You can't just commune with God by going  out into beautiful spots, you know, of nature, and just kind of feeling his presence. That's not  the way you relate to God as a Father.

This is my beloved son, hear ye him. He's a prophet. Now,  the two things I just like to talk about, just the two aspects, is what it means, what a prophet is,  anyway, what does the Bible mean when it talks about prophets? So first of all, what are prophets,  and then secondly, why is Jesus the ultimate prophet? Why is he the final?

I'll show you, the  Bible teaches, he's the final prophet. That's a big difference between Christianity and other religions. Islam will tell you Jesus was a prophet, but they will not grant that he was the final prophet. And there's a lot of other religions that will say Jesus was a prophet, but they will not grant  that he was the final prophet. That's the place where Christianity diverges from others.

They say that Jesus Christ reveals God in an unsurpassable way and brings a disclosure of God  that can't be topped. And here's the reasons why. But anyway, let's take a look, these two things. What are prophets? What does the Bible teach us about prophets and why is Jesus the ultimate prophet?

Number one, what are prophets? You see, it says in the word is mentioned a number of times in the  passage. Jesus is the prophet that Moses was talking about, but it also tells us a great deal about  what prophets did. Look, in verse 18, if you have something to look at, it says, this is how God  fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets. Now you see, if you want to know what a  prophet is, a prophet is a mouthpiece for God.

God foretold these things through the prophets,  doesn't say the prophets foretold. Sometimes it does, but it tells us that whatever the prophet says is  what God says. Now if you want the best definition, biblical definition of prophecy and what a  prophet is, you can go back to an interesting place where Moses is being told by God to go and speak  to Pharaoh. And Moses says, you don't understand. I'm very inarticulate.

I don't like crowds. I get scared  when I get up on a platform. I can't take it. So what does God say? He says, fine.

Aaron's better than  it, you know, it's speaking to you. So he says, quote, this is an Exodus 7, I will make you like God  to Pharaoh and Aaron, like a prophet to you. So whatever you say, Aaron will say. See, now modern people don't believe what the Bible says about prophecy. Modern people will say,  okay, here are the prophets and they have written what the Bible says, the prophets have written,  there's Isaiah and here's Hosea and here's Obadaya and here's all these prophets.

Well, how do we  regard them? We say those are men who have interpreted, they have interpreted, they're giving us  their interpretation of who God is. And that's great. We might learn from them, but of course,  we all have the right to make our own interpretations about what God has said too. And so the idea is  sort of like this.

Let's just say Shostakovich has written a new symphony, but I don't think he can,  isn't he dead? But anyway, but let's just say he has, he's dead, or if he's not dead, he's certainly  probably not writing any symphonies anymore. So you are a critic for the paper and you go  to hear this symphony and you listen and you're all done, you sit down, you write your column and  you say, well, you know, I think that the first, I think that the first movement is a man in bondage,  yes, a man in slavery. And I think the second movement is a man in liberation, a man liberating  himself from bondage. And so you write this down and so on.

And that's how many people say we  should understand prophets. Prophets are people who wrote in the Bible like Isaiah and Hosea and  people like that. And they wrote down their interpretation. They say, well, I think God is like this  and I think God is like that. Well, everybody has a right to their own interpretation, right?

However, what if you ask Shostakovich to write the review of his symphony for the paper? And you said, Mr. Shostakovich, tell us, what were you trying to say in the first movement? What were you trying to say in the second movement? And he writes it down.

And you see,  that's a very different thing than when the critic interprets it. Here you have the author saying  something and it kind of gets rid of the whole idea. You know, if you're, how can you debate  what Shostakovich had in his mind when he wrote the first movement of that symphony? You can't debate  it over. We have it right from his mouth now.

Do we understand when the prophets  write something in the Bible? Should we understand it as a critic interpreting what the composer  meant? Or do we interpret really as nothing more than the very ideas and words of the composer  simply through the mouthpiece of the prophet? And the Bible says very clearly, it says, especially  in 2 Peter, chapter 1, verse 13, no prophecy of Scripture is by the prophet's own interpretation,  but prophets spoke from God not of their own will as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. Period.

You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger brother. In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who try to  earn his love by being good. In his book The prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known  story reveals the heart of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother  and the judgmental older brother, and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal,  extravagant grace. Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith,  The prodigal God will help you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way. The prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the  hope and joy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the world.

This idea of truth is utterly repugnant to the modern mind, and we're modern people and we live  in a modern community, maybe the most modern city anywhere. And yet that's what it means when  the Bible says Jesus was a prophet, and that's what it means when it says the Bible is a word of  prophecy.

Prophets are simply bringing you the very words of God. That's why it says there in verse  he foretold through the prophets. What the prophets say? God says. And therefore the idea of truth  is in Christianity is this is objective truth.

This is not an interpretation of what God thinks. This is what God thinks. It's possible to know what God thinks. Well, I tell you, it's so easy for  for people to say the idea that you can know what God thinks. Who do you think you are?

Christians are often told this. You think you know what God thinks. Who do you think you are? And the only thing you can say at some point is yes, I do believe that our God is knowable. I do believe that our God speaks.

I do believe that our God is not a hidden God. I do believe that our God is not hiding from us. You do. That's the difference. It's not a matter of pride.

I think you can know what God thinks about certain things. Because I believe there's a God who speaks. Not just the God who's out there, not just the God who's  out there, but a God who speaks. Now, Christians will always find when they come to understand this view  of prophetic truth that that God has spoken, that God gives us objective truth. You're going to find that there's two very different alternate worldviews really competing  with Christianity in a city like New York.

Every so often, you know, I mention these two  basic competing worldviews and unfortunately, every time I give them different names, so a lot of you  probably think there's seven or eight. But the two of them are, you know, let me give you all  the different names. The one is sometimes people, sometimes we call it naturalism because it's the  view that nature is all there is. Sometimes we call it secularism that says, you know, there's nothing,  there's no spirit, there's no supernatural. All we have is what is matter.

All that's all. And on the other hand, besides naturalism or secular scientism, you've got pantheism. Pantheism, which means God is in everything. I also sometimes call it new ageism. Confuses everybody.

And they seem very different. The one view says there is no God. Nothing is God. The other view says everything is God. God is a force in all of us.

And therefore, the first view says there's really no truth, only facts. We know scientific facts,  but there's no truth. There's no reality. You see, there's no ultimate reality. Bertrand Russell  says, when the universe dies, all the civilization will go.

So there's no right and wrong. There is  no spirit. There is no purpose or meaning in life. And he says, only if you build your life  on the knowledge of that. Only if you build your life on, he says, the foundations of unhealing  despair will you be safe.

Don't believe any humbug about there being meaning. Don't believe  any humbug that there's right and wrong. We're just made of molecules, period. That's the one view. The other view says, oh, no, God is in everything.

In fact, you are God. And what it says is,  we have to alter our consciousness, move into a new state of consciousness, and look inside of  ourselves to get in touch with our own greatness, our own potential, our own creativity. Now, they sound very different and very often they hate each other and they have fights on  cable television. They fight with each other. You see, the one group, you know, one group it believes,  it's funny.

The one group believes nothing and the other group believes everything. The one group believes in nothing and the other group says, what, to row cards, you know, crystal balls,  channeling, you know, and you know, worshiping nature, yeah, yeah, you know, everything. One group believes in nothing, one group believes in everything. One group says there is no God,  one group says everything is God. And they seem very different.

But here's where they  in practice, in practice, it comes out of the same thing. They both come down to this. You are  your own truth finder. You are your own truth bringer. On the one hand, you see a Bertrand Russell will say, you decide how you want to live.

There's no  right and wrong. On the other side, they say, well, you have to look into yourself and find out  what you really are and who you really are. But when it comes right down to it, in both cases,  there's no truth outside that we have to submit to. You're your own truth finder, you're your own  truth bringer. And I, listen, the one view sounds so noble.

You know, they say to us, they say to  Christians, yes, if you need a belief in God to face the meaninglessness and despair of life, well,  okay, you know, you, they seem, it seems so noble. It seems so, you know, they seem so strong  and courageous. On the other hand, the pantheistic, the new ageistic people, they seem so exotic. So positive, so profound, you see. But I would suggest that there are some very crass motives  that people have to reject the Christian idea of truth because at the very bottom, there is a  childish side of us that doesn't want anybody to tell us what to do.

And as intellectual and as  noble and as positive as profound as it sounds, it plays right into those crass motives, right into  the hands of those crass motives. The book I was reading by Dan Wakefield called New York in the  50s. Dan Wakefield was a guy from the Midwest and he came to Columbia University and he started  reading the existentialist and he began to realize that the universe was a cosmos was meaningless  and that existence was absurd and everybody had to find their own truth, you know. And so he went  down into the village and he began to live any old way he wanted. And he said, you know, he would  get his friends would come from Indiana.

One time he had a woman come from Indiana and they spent  a couple weeks with him and said, she says, Danny, New York is so intellectual. New York is so  sophisticated, so anonymous, I don't know what's in to commit first. And he said, you know, really  what New York gave us was an intellectual construct to justify doing all the things our parents  back in Indiana would never let us do. And so people, a lot of people say, oh, you know,  Christians, you've got motives for wanting to believe in Christ. You've got motives for wanting  to believe that the Bible is really the word of God.

You want authority in your life. You want  certainty in your life. Yeah, sure. That's true. So there's motives there.

What about your motives  for rejecting the concept of truth? You see, you've got tremendous motives. People come,  especially college kids, they just love either to buy into naturalism or pantheism. Why? Because now  I can do all the things my parents would never let me do.

Finally, I can do whatever I want. There's nothing more crash in that and there's nothing more childish than that. Put it this way, your eight year old comes home having played baseball. And he says to you, boy,  I got into kind of a fight. Why, honey?

Well, I was rounding third and this boy tripped me. Well, what did you do? I got up, I grabbed a big rock and I threw it as hard as I could  write it as head and it just missed him. He got very upset and we had a fight. So you say,  son, that was absolutely and totally wrong.

What he did was wrong, but what you did, you could have  killed him. It was disproportionate. It was all out of proportion. It was wrong, always wrong. It's how you're going to ruin your life if you have a contemporary like that.

You're going to  ruin your life if you think you can respond like that. So what does your son say? You weren't there. You don't know. Who do you think you are to tell me what to do?

I mean, that's the way the heart works,  you see. That's the essence of the heart. So what do you say to the kid? You say, I'm 40, you're eight. I am from above.

You are from below. I can see things that you can't see. Absolutely serious. I know it's funny. It is funny.

You can laugh, but it's totally serious. You say to the kid,  I can see life from a vantage point that you can't even imagine. And therefore, unless you hear  my word, if you reject my word, your life will be a wreck. In John chapter 8, Jesus says, I am  the light of the world and everything that I say is true. And if you reject my truth, you will  die in your sins.

And it says here, what does it say? It says, the Lord your God will raise up for  you a prophet, but this prophet will be different than all other prophets. This prophet will not be from  below. This prophet will be from above. And because he's from above, if you don't listen to him,  you will be completely cut off.

So what are we saying? The first point, and there's only two points. Don't worry. The first point, the Bible says that there is objective truth, that Jesus Christ  brings it, but all the prophets brought it. Now we're going to see in a minute why Jesus Christ is  the ultimate bringer of truth, but the prophets bring a truth which trumps all other sources of  information.

See, the other worldviews hate that idea. They say, well, we're all on competition. Oh, Isaiah, they have an interpretation of God, but so does Shakespeare, so does my English teacher,  so do I. Everybody has their own interpretation. The Bible says, no, there are some people who have  spoken that are prophets, and they bring a truth which is from above.

And therefore that truth  trumps all other truth, all other source of information. You've got your heart motions, right? You've got expert opinion, you've got your traditions that you were raised in, and you've got public  opinion. Jesus' truth, God's truth trumps all other kinds of truth. If it differs with public  opinion, you have to follow it.

If it differs with your feelings, you have to follow it. That's the  nature of truth. That's the nature of, that's what it means when the Bible says that there are  prophets, that God has sent prophets, though you've murdered the prophets, when I sent them to you,  he says, I will keep sending them to you because they bring the truth. You don't like the idea of  a truth that trumps you, but it does. Now, one more thing about this.

I know that what I said  sounds very harsh. The doctrine of God's truth, the idea of God's truth, the Bible gives us,  it's hard, it's unyielding, it's got sharp edges to it, it's like chewing on a diamond,  I know that. And yet, what about Beethoven? We hate the idea that there is truth that no matter  how much we want to do this, we're not allowed. That no matter how much we don't want to do this,  we have to.

That idea, we just hate it. That's why we love to jump into the existentialists. We  love to jump into the New Age, we love to jump into complete skepticism about any truth at all,  you see. We just love that idea. We hate the idea of it being a prophet.

I know it sounds very  harsh, but what are you going to do about Beethoven? Because you see, Pascal puts it this way,  just as we have an incapacity for proving anything which no amount of dogmatism can overcome. Hear that? He says, on the one hand, we really can't prove anything. Nobody can prove anything.

He says, on the one hand, we have an incapacity for proving anything which no amount of dogmatism  can overcome yet. He says, we have a concept of the truth which no amount of skepticism can overcome. What I'm trying to say is, you look at the people, and maybe I know some of you are these people. Look at the people who say, ah, there is no truth, like Bertrand Russell. And look at the people  who say, well, truth is found within.

Look at the people who say there's no such thing as objective  truth. And yet, every human being, every human being has a concept of truth that no amount of  skepticism can overcome. We all know that some things are right or wrong regardless of what people  believed. Isn't that right? Some things are just wrong, we say.

But if you don't believe in a God  who speaks through the prophets, you've got no basis for that. You've got no basis for believing it. And you can't help but believe it. You know there's a truth. You know there's a God who speaks.

Okay. So first, we learn that God speaks through the prophets. But lastly, we also learn in this  passage that Jesus is the ultimate prophet. He's the final revealer of the truth. Why?

You see,  notice, even though he's a prophet, it tells us that he is what all the prophets were speaking of. It says, this is how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, saying his  Christ would suffer. Repent then and turn to God so that your sins may be wiped out. In other words,  Jesus Christ is not only the subject of prophecy. He's the object of prophecy.

He not only brings  the truth, but he is the truth to which all the prophets have always been pointing. And that means  what makes him different and all your prophets is simple. He is not just the one who brings the truth. He is the truth. Buddha, Mohammed, and Moses, and Abraham, all of them come and here's what they  say.

They say, don't look at me. I am pointing to God. I'm pointing to the way to God. Don't look at me. So I am nothing in myself.

I am pointing to him. Jesus is the first prophet who comes along saying,  I am pointing to me. You can only find God through me. I am the way, the truth, the life. No one  comes to the Father, but by me.

And it says in Hebrews chapter 1, verse 1, it's astonishing thing. It says, in the past, God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets in many times and in many ways. But now he has spoken to us by his son, who is the radiance of God's glory and the exact  representation of his being. That's just, you know, there is no parallel for such a statement. It says, why all other prophets, what they told us was piecemeal, every other prophet who has  ever lived.

In fact, I could even go so far and say, every other prophet of any other religion  comes and tells us true things. You know, they would never have gotten off the ground. I'm not  saying, Muhammad says plenty of true things. Buddhist is plenty of true things. They have to,  you know, you do not get a religion off the ground unless there's a lot of truth in it, an awful lot.

But Jesus is the only one who comes not saying pointing over his shoulder but pointing to his own  heart. He's the one that comes and says, they can tell you a lot about God, but I can show you God. So I am the ultimate revealer. Why? Because all other prophets give us pieces of the truth in many  ways and many places we heard, but now God has spoken in this final way.

Why is it unsurpassed? Because he is the very radiance of his glory and the exact representation of his being. And that's the reason why we have to say, how could anyone come after Jesus and add anything? How could he? Unless there's a fourth person to the Trinity and then it wouldn't be a Trinity,  you see?

No, there are been prophets, you know, Muhammad came along afterwards that Jesus is a  prophet, but I trump him. I'm the ultimate. I bring a higher view. I bring a better view. Baha'u'la said the same thing.

People have been doing it all the 20th century. The only way you could really get away with that rationally is to say, I am God. In fact,  I'm a better, I'm a bigger, I'm a better manifestation of the radiance of God's glory,  and I'm a more exact representation of his being than Jesus. Nobody has ever dared make such a claim  except people who are lunatics. Why?

You can't get away with it unless you are a heck of a moral,  glorious character. You better be unbelievably great person. Your wisdom and your beauty and  your attractiveness and your compassion and your absolute consistency. Only Jesus has ever been  able to claim that and get away with it because only Jesus had the life to match his claim. And  therefore, he is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being.

And let me conclude by saying, he is not just a prophet because as God, he shows us who God is  because he's so compassionate and loving in the way in which he talks and acts and moves. No, ultimately, Jesus is the ultimate revealer. Well, this is what's so great about why you can't  move Prophet Priest and King away from each other. He is the ultimate prophet because he's the priest  and the king. On the cross, listen.

Other prophets have told us, haven't they? That God is holy. Other prophets have told us, haven't they? That God is love. Prophets, in all religions, have come and said, God is holy.

He is just. He hates evil. He hates sin,  right? And all the prophets have come and said, God is loving. God is compassionate.

And Jesus  was no different. He came and he said, God hates sin. He also came and said, God loves you. And he told the parable, the prodigal son. And he showed how when we come back to God, the father  is so eager to have us back that he comes rushing to us before we can even get half of our repentance  out of our mouth.

He leaps on us and he kisses our neck. Now, Jesus, like a prophet, told us those  things. But Jesus, because he's a priest, is the ultimate prophet, because on the cross, he shows  in a way that no prophet ever has or ever could. He reveals in a way that no prophet ever has or  ever could. The absolute glory of God, because he reconciles the holiness and love of God on the cross.

The one place in history, the one place in the universe, where the holiness and the love of God  shine out with equal brightness is on the cross. Because when you understand the logic of the cross,  Jesus died for you. So the more God poured out his wrath on sin, the more he saved us. On the cross and only on the cross, God is both just and justifier of those who believe. Only there is God's heart, his essence revealed.

Only the true glory of God. There is no other  religion. There is no other prophet. There's no other place anywhere that shows us that like that. Why?

Because you say Jesus is more than a prophet. And that's why he's the ultimate prophet. And I tell you that if you follow any other prophet and make any other prophet supreme, any other  source of truth supreme over Jesus, you will either see the holiness of God or the love of God,  but you'll never see them together. Never. You'll either be either a legalistic person or lie  sensuous person.

You will be an unbalanced person, but you'll never hold it all together. You'll never see how they, the righteousness and the love of God, kiss and embrace and weep and  fall on each other's neck, so that God can weep and fall on your neck. Only this prophet says to  the woman caught in adultery, I don't condemn thee, but yet he says go and send no more. How can he  do both? The cross.

Only he do here do we have God, God who is just and justifier. It's  unsurpassed. It's unbelievable. Look into the face of this prophet. Look into the face of this  God, of this of this prophet, Jesus Christ, and you will see the face of the Father.

Is he? Listen, Jesus says, this is my beloved son, here ye him. Let me ask you to conclude. Do you? Do you just hope that Jesus will kind of love you, but you don't want to study his teaching,  master his teaching?

You really don't like the idea that he has the right to tell you what to do? I tell you something. Do you want him to redeem you? Do you want him to love you? Do you want him to open away to the Father?

You have to hear him. You have to listen to him. You've got to let his hard, unyielding objective truth into your life. Are you willing to do that? Because he's all of these things or he's none of these things, but because he's all of these things,  he shows us the Father.

He's the absolute representation, exact representation of his being  and the radiance of his glory. Let's pray. Father, we thank you that all this is for us,  we thank you that because Jesus Christ came and died, you can look at our sin and yet fall on our  neck and say, put on my robe, put on my ring, let's kill the fatted calf, let's dance and sing  for your mind, your home. Father, when we see Jesus Christ and only when we see Jesus Christ,  are we able to really see you, only he reveals you, only he does. Thank you for the uniqueness,  thank you for the supremacy of his revelation of your being and of your radiance and of your glory.

We pray that tonight, the two things we might learn is that we need to study the Bible,  we need to study, here's the scripture, we need to know it inside out. But on the other hand, that your son, Jesus Christ, is the supreme and ultimate prophet  and his truth trumps all of the truths and the picture that he gives us of you is the supreme  picture that's possible. We thank you for this great disclosure and we ask that you would help  us to take it in to our own lives and be changed by it. No one knows the Father except the Son  and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him. In Jesus name we pray, amen.

### 中文翻译

### 引言：耶稣是谁？

耶稣是谁？圣经说他是完全的神，是宇宙的创造者，同时又是完全的人。失去其中之一，你就失去了基督教。加入我们今天的播客，蒂姆·凯勒将探讨耶稣基督的人物和应许。

### 理解耶稣的重要性

每年一月和六月，牧师们会聚在一起，围绕某个主题或课题进行简短的系列讲道。在一月份，我们正在做的事情，如果你想看到主题如何划分以及所有任务如何分配，你可以在公告的最后一页找到，告诉你我们在一月份做的事情。我们在谈论如何理解耶稣。有人可能会说，你不是一直在谈论如何理解耶稣吗？答案是，偶尔给人们一个全面的直升机视角来看待基督的圣经教义是个好主意。

> “基督的圣经教义意味着查看圣经关于耶稣教导的各个方面。”

**圣经教导我们关于耶稣的人性。他是人，也是神。**

### 耶稣作为先知、祭司和君王

圣经教导关于他工作的三件伟大事情。圣经告诉我们的所有事情都可以归入三个基本类别。他是先知，他是祭司，他是君王。我们有必要花一个月的时间基本上对他的这三个工作方面进行调查。

- 先知：上帝的启示者
- 祭司：救赎者和代言人
- 君王：最高权威

### 片面理解的危险

现在让我给你展示一下如果你忽略其中任何一个会发生什么。我在纽约遇到了很多这样的人。我一直在思考这个问题，因为我在读一本书。我会再次提到它。它叫做《50年代的纽约》，作者是丹·维克菲尔德，他是50年代初哥伦比亚大学的学生，住在格林威治村，成为波希米亚场景中的一部分。

> “你不能只把耶稣当作祭司，而不是先知或君王。”

**他是完全的先知、完全的祭司和完全的君王。你不能只拥有他的一部分。**

### 耶稣作为终极先知

让我读一下，相信与否，有一段经文，是的。让我读一下使徒行传第三章，第17到26节。现在，我刚刚给你介绍了这个月的内容。现在，读使徒行传第三章，第17到26节，并且我们想从中提取出两个基本的东西，告诉你关于耶稣作为伟大和终极先知以及上帝启示者的一些事情。

> “这是我的爱子，你们要听他。”

**耶稣不仅仅是一个先知，因为作为神，他向我们展示了神是谁，因为他在说话、行动和移动的方式上是如此富有同情心和爱心。**

### 结论：耶稣启示的至高性

父啊，我们感谢你，这一切都是为我们准备的，我们感谢你，因为耶稣基督来了并死了，你可以看我们的罪，却仍然扑在我们脖子上说，穿上我的袍子，戴上我的戒指，让我们宰杀肥牛犊，让我们跳舞唱歌，因为你是我的，你回家了。父啊，当我们看到耶稣基督时，只有当我们看到耶稣基督时，我们才能真正看到你，只有他揭示了你，只有他做到了。感谢你他的独特性，感谢你他启示你存在和光辉的至高性。

**我们祈祷今晚，我们可能学到的两件事是，我们需要学习圣经，我们需要学习，这里是经文，我们需要彻底了解它。**

## Chinese Transcript / 中文

今天的播客中,蒂姆·凯勒探讨耶稣基督的位格和应许。每年一月和六月,牧师们会聚在一起,就某个主题或题目进行一个短系列讲道。我们在一月份所做的,实际上,如果你想看看这个主题是如何划分的,所有的任务是如何分配的,你可以在公告的最后一页找到,它告诉你我们在一月份做什么。在讲述之后,我们在谈论如何理解耶稣。现在这意味着有人可能会说,但你不是一直在谈论如何理解耶稣吗?

答案是,每隔一段时间,给人们一个全面的视角,从空中俯瞰圣经中关于基督的教义,这是一个好主意。圣经中关于基督的教义意味着看圣经教导的关于耶稣的各个方面。圣经教导我们关于耶稣的位格。祂既是人又是神。上周斯科特在早晚崇拜中处理了这个问题。

在某些时候,非常非常重要的是,要看一看圣经关于基督位格教导的两个方面。因为如果你只看到祂是人而不是神,或者只看到祂是神而不是人,你就会陷入一些巨大的麻烦,你对它的扭曲就不是基督教,无论你得出什么结论,它都不是基督教,除非你把这两者结合在一起。圣经除了教导关于祂位格的这两个伟大真理之外,圣经还教导了关于祂工作的三个伟大真理。圣经告诉我们祂所做的所有事情,都归入三个基本类别。祂是先知,祂是祭司,祂是君王。

我们应该花一个月的时间,基本上对祂工作的这三个方面进行一次概览。现在让我为你们把整个事情放在上下文中片刻。当我说有三件事,耶稣所做的一切,祂在圣经任何地方所说或所做的一切都可以归入这三个类别之一。使用这些类别是因为它们如此关键。如果你遗漏了这三样中的任何一样,如果你把祂看作其中两样而不是第三样,如果你把祂看作其中一样而不是第三样,它会给你一个扭曲。

它扭曲了你对现实的看法。它肯定会给你一个不是基督教的混合物,如果你把它吸收到你的系统中,它在灵性上是有毒的。让我给你举几个例子。有很多人,当我们说先知、祭司和君王时,说到先知,我们的意思是祂是一位启示者。祂传达真理。

祂是神的启示者。神是谁,祂的旨意是什么,这就是先知。其次,祂是祭司。这意味着祂是救赎者。祂是代表,也就是说祂来代替我们的位置。

你看,作为先知,祂实际上是代表神来的,但作为祭司,祂代表我们。作为先知,祂来为神向你我说话。但作为祭司,祂来为我们向父神说话。祂是我们的替身。祂替我们死。

你看,祂把我们带到神面前。祂是我们的中保。祂是我们的代表。祂是我们的救赎者。所以首先,祂是先知,启示者。

其次,祂是祭司,救赎者。第三,祂是君王,统治者。祂命令我们。我们欠祂绝对的忠诚。祂是我们生命中的至高权威。

所以祂就是先知、祭司和君王,启示者、救赎者和统治者。现在,让我向你们展示如果你遗漏其中任何一个会发生什么。我在纽约遇到过很多人。我一直在思考这个问题,因为我一直在读一本书。我会再次提到它。

书名叫《50年代的纽约》,作者是丹·韦克菲尔德,他是50年代初哥伦比亚大学的学生,住在格兰特村,成为垮掉的一代和波西米亚圈子的一部分。你知道,他是个作家,无论如何,我注意到的一件事,我在读这本书时,我意识到我遇到了这么多从美国中部来到纽约市的人。在美国中部,他们在很多情况下都有相当正统的基督教养育。但他们来到纽约,就完全抛弃了它。他们鄙视他们童年的宗教以及中产阶级美国的价值观,伟大的同质化美国的价值观,他们投身于纽约的知识、文化和种族多样性,他们认为自己现在是一个优越的种族,相比他们来自的地方。

我经常和这些人交谈,你知道你们是谁。他们会说,你知道,我不去教会,我基本上按照我觉得应该生活的方式生活,我不知道我现在还相信什么了,真的。但我知道这一点,当我还是个小女孩,当我还是个小男孩时,我为基督做了一个决定,我仍然以某种方式相信祂真的支持我。我真的以某种方式相信祂仍然与我同在。换句话说,我来到这里,我的感觉、我的经验和我的情绪现在是我的君王,它们也是我的先知。

换句话说,我带来我自己的真理,我决定什么真理对我是真实的,我决定如何生活。但我仍然想要以某种方式拥有一位作为救赎者的耶稣的观念。我不想要祂作君王,我也不想要祂作先知。我不想要祂告诉我什么是真理,我也不想要祂给我任何命令。但不知何故,我就是喜欢祂爱我、祂宽恕我、祂一直与我同在的想法。

好吗?那不是基督教。那是某种东西,但它不是基督教。你不能只把耶稣当作祭司而不是先知或君王。只作为救赎者而不是启示者和统治者。

我是提摩太·詹姆斯·凯勒,如果有人对我说,进来,詹姆斯,别进来,提摩太,还有凯勒。我会陷入困境。我不会说,嗯,你知道,我是一个整体。我不知道我的哪一部分是詹姆斯部分,也许是我的左臂。也许你可以拥有那个。

它不是那样运作的。我完全是提摩太。我完全是詹姆斯。我完全是凯勒。祂完全是先知、完全是祭司、完全是君王。

你不能只拥有祂的一部分。好的,让我,另一个例子,但我会更简短,就是有很多团体。我猜我会说教会,但有很多团体喜欢耶稣的观念。他们真的有一个非常发达的耶稣作为君王和指挥官的观点。但他们对祂作为救赎者的理解,他们对祂作为中保的理解非常不发达。

在那些律法主义团体中,你知道,你被"耶稣说"砸头,耶稣说,耶稣说,非常生动。它以一种非常富有想象力和生动的方式呈现出来,但任何关于祂的救赎、关于祂的恩典、关于祂的爱的讨论都是抽象的。耶稣是君王。没有耶稣作为先知和祭司的耶稣作为君王是一个可怕、可怕的地方。然而,这并不真的是耶稣。

或者现在,再举一个例子,就像律法主义团体喜欢祂作君王而不是作祭司,就像放纵的人喜欢祂作祭司,但他们不喜欢祂作君王或启示者的想法。所以今天有很多人。他们并不真正喜欢耶稣作先知的想法,但不是作祭司和君王。换句话说,他们说,我相信耶稣是一位伟大的教师。我相信祂向我们启示了很多关于神的事情。

但我就是不能接受祂是一位神圣救主、神圣君王等等的整个观念。现在,最著名的,我只在这里提到它,在所有现代基督教文学中最著名的段落之一,必定是C.S.路易斯在《纯粹的基督教》中的那一章,他指出那是你不能相信的唯一一件事,就是祂只是一位先知。他说这位先知的问题是,耶稣基督,这位先知,来了,祂说,我是神。你必须敬拜我。

只有我能赦免你的罪。你对我的看法将决定你在永恒中的去处。所以这个人带着所有这些令人难以置信的主张来了。说祂是神,说祂必须成为你生命中的最终权威等等,你是祂将兴起或跌倒的石头等等。所以路易斯说了一些非常明显的事情。

他说,如果这是真的,祂声称所有这些事情,那么祂要么远超过一位先知,要么远不如一位先知,但祂不能只是一位先知。要么祂远超过一位先知,因为祂声称自己是,否则,祂是疯子或骗子,祂是傻瓜,祂远不如一位先知,要么祂超过先知,否则我们不能相信祂所说的任何话。但祂不允许你相信的一件事是祂只是一位先知而不是祭司和君王。你看,如果你试图抓住一个,如果你要么有一个或两个而拒绝其他的,或者如果你只是抓住一个而对其他的有模糊的理解,它会在你的生活中引入扭曲。事实上,事实上,我认为这是可能的,尽管我认为我现在不能深入讨论。

作为一名牧师,我可以为自己创建一个网格,帮助人们理解他们的基督徒生活出了什么问题。我这里说的是基督徒。我认为在大多数情况下,如果我们看看我们的基督徒生活,我们说,有什么问题,我们需要在哪里成长?我们的基督徒生活中哪里有压力裂缝?哪里有崩溃,哪里有恶化,哪里有软弱?

通常,你可以通过查看这个网格来做到这一点。很多时候,我们真的很擅长。我们对耶稣作为其中一样有很好的把握,对耶稣作为另一样也有把握。你们有些人真的很擅长圣经学习。耶稣作先知的观念很好。

你喜欢学习祂的教导,你知道得非常非常好,但你却不顺服祂作君王。你们有些人非常非常顺服祂作君王,但你只是充满了罪疚和焦虑,被负担压得喘不过气来,你对自己有一个可怕的看法,因为你真的没有很好地把握耶稣作为救赎者和祭司。不要只是说,你知道,这三件事,这就是为什么我们要在每一个上面花几周时间,每个上面讲几篇道。祂是先知,祂是祭司,祂是君王。现在,说了这些,我只是为整个月设定了上下文,今晚,我想说,尽管祂远不止是一位先知,祂是一位先知,这意味着什么?

让我读,信不信由你,有一段经文,是的。让我读使徒行传第三章,第17到26节。现在,我刚给了你们这个月的介绍。现在,使徒行传第三章,第17到26节,读它,我们想从中引出两个基本的东西,它告诉你一些关于耶稣作为伟大的、终极的先知和向我们启示神的事情。在使徒行传第三章中,它读到,从第17节开始,这是彼得在讲道。

他说,弟兄们,我知道你们做这事是出于无知,你们的官长也是如此,但神曾藉众先知的口预言基督将要受害,就这样应验了。所以你们当悔改归正,使你们的罪得以涂抹,这样,那安舒的日子就必从主面前来到;主也必差遣所预定给你们的基督,就是耶稣。天必留祂,等到万物复兴的时候,就是神从创世以来、藉着圣先知的口所说的。摩西曾说:'主你们的神要从你们弟兄中间给你们兴起一位先知像我,凡祂向你们所说的,你们都要听从。凡不听从那先知的,必要从民中全然灭绝。'

从撒母耳以来的众先知,凡说预言的,也都说到这些日子。你们是先知的子孙,也承受神与你们祖宗所立的约,就是对亚伯拉罕说:'地上万族都要因你的后裔得福。'神既兴起祂的仆人,就先差祂到你们这里来,赐福给你们,叫你们各人回转,离开罪恶。现在,我们在这里看到什么?首先,我们看到显而易见的,那就是耶稣基督是一位先知。它说,彼得说,摩西曾预言,主你们的神要给你们兴起一位先知像我,摩西说。

从你们弟兄中间,凡祂向你们所说的,你们都要听从。凡不听从祂的,必要全然灭绝。现在,摩西所说的是,你认为我是一位好先知,将有一位先知要来,超越所有先知。祂会像我,但祂会在祂的权威上如此至高无上,在祂的权威和真理上如此关键,以至于你与祂的关系将完全决定你是否被接纳或被剪除。所以,彼得说,这就是耶稣。

耶稣就是那位要来的。你知道,这教导我们什么?好的,首先,耶稣是先知这一事实,不仅是祭司和君王,而是先知,向我们表明我们有一位向我们说话的神。现在,我想让你们知道,自从时间开始以来,似乎人类一直渴望有一个与他们对话的宇宙,有一个与他们交谈的宇宙。如果你从一开始就阅读我们的文学,看看我们的歌曲,我们一直在想象会说话的树木和会说话的动物。

即使在我们的科幻小说中,我们想象来自其他星球的其他种族,你知道,我们非常害怕这样一个想法:也许我们是世界上唯一的说话者。但也许这是一个非人格的、沉默的宇宙。也许在底层没有人可以交谈。没有理性的,没有理性的他者。圣经说那不是真的。

你相信有的原因,你如此渴望有其他人可以交谈的原因是因为真的有。我喜爱伦纳德·伯恩斯坦的一件事是,他说,你知道,我不相信圣经,我不相信那种东西。然而,记得,他说,当我听贝多芬时,记得那句名言,我不,这就是为什么我要读它。他说,当我听贝多芬时,他说,贝多芬让我们感觉到世界上有些东西是对的,有些东西是一致的,有些东西始终遵循自己的规律,我们可以信任的东西,永远不会让我们失望的东西。换句话说,他说,你知道,我不相信绝对真理。

我不相信一个内部真理的体系,它内在一致,绝对符合自己的内在规律,是我们可以信任的、永远不会让我们失望的、始终一致的东西。然而,当我听贝多芬时,我觉得它一定存在。圣经说,你想要相信会说话的树木的原因,你想要相信有一个宇宙在那里与你交谈,有一个理性的中心可以与我们交谈的原因,是因为真的有。原因是,即使你在理智上说,我拒绝绝对真理的整个观念,我拒绝向我们说话的家伙的观念,当我谈论时,当我听贝多芬时,我知道还有别的东西,我们不是孤独的,在一个非理性的宇宙中的理性,在一个非人格的宇宙中的人格,在一个沉默的宇宙中的说话者。我不能相信那个。

嗯,圣经说你不能相信它的原因,你想要相信它的原因,你从哪里得到这个想法?是因为它是真的,因为你知道它,因为有一位说话的神,祂向耶稣说话,当耶稣变像时,记得变像山上的变像,在那里的使徒们看到了耶稣,他们看到摩西在一边,以利亚在另一边,先知们,耶稣站在中间。从天上传来一个声音,记得它说了什么吗?这是我的儿子,神说,你们要听祂。你们要听祂。

你不能把耶稣基督当作某种神秘的人物。祂是教师,祂是先知,祂带来真理,你必须,你与父的关系是通过先知的,这意味着你与神的关系不只是一种神秘的合一,它是一种基于交流和接受那种交流的关系。它是理性的,它是有序的,这位先知带来了一个真理体系,这就是你们关系的基础。你不能只是通过去美丽的自然景点,你知道,只是感受祂的同在来与神交流。那不是你作为父与神建立关系的方式。

这是我的爱子,你们要听祂。祂是先知。现在,我只想谈谈两个方面,只是先知是什么意思,无论如何,当圣经谈论先知时,圣经是什么意思?所以首先,什么是先知,然后其次,为什么耶稣是终极的先知?为什么祂是最终的?

我会向你们展示,圣经教导,祂是最终的先知。这是基督教与其他宗教之间的一个大区别。伊斯兰教会告诉你耶稣是一位先知,但他们不会承认祂是最终的先知。还有很多其他宗教会说耶稣是一位先知,但他们不会承认祂是最终的先知。这就是基督教与其他宗教分道扬镳的地方。

他们说耶稣基督以一种无法超越的方式启示神,带来了一种无法超越的神的披露。这就是原因。但无论如何,让我们看看,这两件事。什么是先知?圣经教导我们关于先知的什么,为什么耶稣是终极的先知?

第一,什么是先知?你看,它在这段话中多次提到这个词。耶稣是摩西所谈论的先知,但它也告诉我们很多关于先知所做的事情。看,在第18节,如果你有东西可以看的话,它说,神曾藉众先知的口预言的,就这样应验了。现在你看,如果你想知道什么是先知,先知是神的代言人。神藉先知预言这些事,不是说先知们预言。有时确实这样说,但它告诉我们,无论先知说什么,就是神说什么。现在,如果你想要最好的定义,先知和先知预言的圣经定义,你可以回到一个有趣的地方,摩西被神告知要去向法老说话。摩西说,你不理解。我非常不善言辞。

我不喜欢人群。当我站在讲台上时,我会害怕。我受不了。那么神说什么呢?祂说,好的。

亚伦比你更善于说话,你知道。所以祂说,引用,这是在出埃及记第7章,我要使你在法老面前代替神,你的哥哥亚伦是替你说话的。所以无论你说什么,亚伦都会说。看,现在现代人不相信圣经关于预言所说的话。现代人会说,好的,这里是先知,他们写了圣经所说的,先知们写了,有以赛亚,这里有何西阿,这里有俄巴底亚,这里有所有这些先知。

嗯,我们如何看待他们?我们说那些人已经解释了,他们已经解释了,他们在给我们关于神是谁的解释。那很好。我们可以向他们学习,但当然,我们都有权对神所说的话做出自己的解释。所以这个想法有点像这样。假设肖斯塔科维奇写了一首新交响曲,但我认为他不能,他不是死了吗?但无论如何,假设他写了,他死了,或者如果他没死,他肯定可能不再写任何交响曲了。所以你是报纸的评论家,你去听这首交响曲,你听完了,你坐下来,你写你的专栏,你说,嗯,你知道,我认为,我认为第一乐章是一个被束缚的人,是的,一个被奴役的人。我认为第二乐章是一个解放的人,一个从束缚中解放自己的人。所以你把这个写下来,等等。

很多人说我们应该这样理解先知。先知是在圣经中写作的人,如以赛亚和何西阿以及那样的人。他们写下了他们的解释。他们说,嗯,我认为神是这样的,我认为神是那样的。嗯,每个人都有权有自己的解释,对吧?

然而,如果你请肖斯塔科维奇为报纸写他的交响曲评论会怎样?你说,肖斯塔科维奇先生,告诉我们,你在第一乐章中想说什么?你在第二乐章中想说什么?他把它写下来。

你看,这与评论家解释它是非常不同的事情。在这里你有作者在说一些东西,它有点消除了整个想法。你知道,如果你,当肖斯塔科维奇写交响曲的第一乐章时,他心中有什么,你怎么能辩论呢?你不能辩论它。我们现在直接从他嘴里得到了它。当先知在圣经中写一些东西时,我们理解它吗?我们应该把它理解为评论家在解释作曲家的意思吗?还是我们真的只是把它解释为作曲家的想法和话语,只是通过先知的口说出来?圣经说得很清楚,它说,特别是在彼得后书第1章第13节,圣经中没有任何预言是先知自己的解释,而是先知们被圣灵感动,从神说出来,不是出于自己的意志。句号。

你可能知道浪子的故事,但它不仅仅是关于一个任性的小弟弟。事实上,耶稣讲这个故事是为了向那些逃离神的人和那些试图通过行善来赚取祂的爱的人说话。在他的书《浪子的神》中,蒂姆·凯勒展示了这个众所周知的故事如何揭示福音的核心,一个对叛逆的小弟弟和论断的大哥哥都充满希望的信息,并邀请所有人经历神浪子般的、奢侈的恩典。无论你是基督徒还是仍在探索信仰,《浪子的神》都将帮助你以全新的方式看待你与基督的关系。《浪子的神》是我们对你本月捐献的感谢,帮助"福音与生命"与世界各地的人分享基督仁慈和不懈之爱的希望和喜乐。

今天就在gospelandlife.com/give索取你的副本。那是gospelandlife.com/give。现在我知道,我提出这一点的一个原因,我们必须时不时地提出这一点。这种关于真理的观念对现代人的思想来说是完全令人反感的,我们是现代人,我们生活在一个现代社区,也许是任何地方最现代的城市。然而,当圣经说耶稣是先知时,这就是它的意思,当它说圣经是预言的话语时,这就是它的意思。

先知只是在向你传达神的话语。这就是为什么它在那里说祂藉先知预言。先知说的话就是神说的话。因此,基督教中关于真理的观念是这是客观真理。这不是对神想法的解释。这就是神的想法。有可能知道神的想法。嗯,我告诉你,人们很容易说你能知道神想法的观念。你以为你是谁?

基督徒经常被这样告知。你认为你知道神的想法。你以为你是谁?你在某个时候唯一能说的是,是的,我确实相信我们的神是可知的。我确实相信我们的神说话。我确实相信我们的神不是一位隐藏的神。我确实相信我们的神没有躲避我们。你相信。这就是区别。这不是骄傲的问题。

我认为你可以知道神对某些事情的想法。因为我相信有一位说话的神。不只是那位在那里的神,不只是那位在外面的神,而是一位说话的神。现在,基督徒在理解这种先知真理的观点时总会发现,神已经说话了,神给我们客观真理。你会发现有两种非常不同的替代世界观真的在与基督教竞争,在像纽约这样的城市。

每隔一段时间,你知道,我提到这两个基本的竞争世界观,不幸的是,每次我给它们起不同的名字,所以你们很多人可能认为有七八个。但其中两个是,你知道,让我给你所有不同的名字。一个有时被人们称为自然主义,因为它认为自然就是一切。有时我们称之为世俗主义,它说,你知道,没有,没有精神,没有超自然。我们所拥有的只是物质。就这些。另一方面,除了自然主义或世俗科学主义,你还有泛神论。泛神论,意思是神在一切之中。我有时也称之为新时代主义。让每个人都困惑。它们看起来非常不同。一种观点说没有神。什么都不是神。另一种观点说一切都是神。神是我们所有人中的一种力量。

因此,第一种观点说真的没有真理,只有事实。我们知道科学事实,但没有真理。没有现实。你看,没有终极的现实。伯特兰·罗素说,当宇宙死亡时,所有的文明都会消失。所以没有对错。没有精神。生命中没有目的或意义。他说,只有当你把你的生命建立在对那的了解上。只有当你把你的生命建立在,他说,不可治愈的绝望的基础上,你才会安全。

不要相信任何关于有意义的胡说。不要相信任何关于有对错的胡说。我们只是由分子组成的,句号。那是一种观点。另一种观点说,哦,不,神在一切之中。事实上,你就是神。它说的是,我们必须改变我们的意识,进入一种新的意识状态,向内寻找,接触我们自己的伟大,我们自己的潜力,我们自己的创造力。现在,它们听起来非常不同,它们经常彼此憎恨,他们在有线电视上打架。他们互相争斗。你看,一个群体,你知道,一个群体相信,很有趣。一个群体什么都不信,另一个群体什么都信。一个群体什么都不信,另一个群体说,什么,塔罗牌,你知道,水晶球,通灵,你知道,崇拜自然,是的,是的,你知道,一切。一个群体什么都不信,一个群体什么都信。一个群体说没有神,一个群体说一切都是神。它们看起来非常不同。

但这就是它们在实践中,在实践中的结果。它们都归结为这一点。你是你自己的真理发现者。你是你自己的真理带来者。一方面,你看伯特兰·罗素会说,你决定你想如何生活。没有对错。另一方面,他们说,嗯,你必须向内寻找,找出你真正是什么,你真正是谁。但说到底,在这两种情况下,都没有我们必须服从的外在真理。你是你自己的真理发现者,你是你自己的真理带来者。我,听着,一种观点听起来如此高尚。你知道,他们对我们说,他们对基督徒说,是的,如果你需要相信神来面对生命的无意义和绝望,好吧,好的,你知道,你,他们看起来,似乎很高尚。似乎很,你知道,他们似乎很坚强和勇敢。另一方面,泛神论的,新时代的人,他们看起来如此异国情调。如此积极,如此深刻,你看。但我建议,人们拒绝基督教真理观念有一些非常粗俗的动机,因为在最底层,我们有一个孩子气的一面,不想让任何人告诉我们该做什么。

尽管听起来如此知识化、如此高尚、如此积极深刻,它恰恰迎合了那些粗俗的动机,恰恰落入了那些粗俗动机的手中。我读的那本书,丹·韦克菲尔德写的《50年代的纽约》。丹·韦克菲尔德是一个来自中西部的人,他来到哥伦比亚大学,他开始阅读存在主义者,他开始意识到宇宙、宇宙是无意义的,存在是荒谬的,每个人都必须找到自己的真理,你知道。所以他下到村子里,他开始以任何他想要的方式生活。他说,你知道,他会,他的朋友们会从印第安纳州来。有一次,他有一个女人从印第安纳州来,他们和他一起待了几周,说,她说,丹尼,纽约如此知识化。纽约如此复杂,如此匿名,我不知道首先要犯什么罪。

他说,你知道,真正纽约给我们的是一个知识建构,来为做我们在印第安纳州的父母永远不会让我们做的所有事情辩护。所以很多人说,哦,你知道,基督徒,你们有相信基督的动机。你们有想要相信圣经真的是神的话语的动机。你想要生命中的权威。你想要生命中的确定性。是的,当然。那是真的。所以那里有动机。那你拒绝真理概念的动机呢?你看,你有巨大的动机。人们来,尤其是大学生,他们就是喜欢接受自然主义或泛神论。为什么?因为现在我可以做我父母永远不会让我做的所有事情。

最后,我可以做任何我想做的事。没有什么比这更粗俗的了,没有什么比这更孩子气的了。这样说吧,你8岁的孩子打完棒球回家。他对你说,哇,我打了一架。为什么,亲爱的?嗯,我在绕三垒时,这个男孩绊倒了我。嗯,你做了什么?我站起来,我抓起一块大石头,我尽可能用力地扔向他的头,只是没打中他。他非常不高兴,我们打了一架。所以你说,儿子,那是绝对地、完全地错了。

他做的是错的,但你做的,你可能会杀了他。那是不成比例的。那是完全不相称的。那是错的,永远是错的。如果你有那样的气质,你会毁了你的生活。如果你认为你可以那样回应,你会毁了你的生活。所以你儿子说什么?你不在那里。你不知道。你以为你是谁来告诉我该做什么?

我的意思是,这就是心的运作方式,你看。这就是心的本质。所以你对孩子说什么?你说,我40岁,你8岁。我来自上面。你来自下面。我能看到你看不到的东西。绝对严肃。我知道这很有趣。它是有趣的。你可以笑,但这是完全严肃的。你对孩子说,我可以从一个你甚至无法想象的有利位置来看待生活。因此,除非你听我的话,如果你拒绝我的话,你的生命将是一片废墟。在约翰福音第8章,耶稣说,我是世界的光,我所说的一切都是真实的。如果你拒绝我的真理,你就会死在你的罪中。

这里说什么?它说,主你们的神要为你们兴起一位先知,但这位先知将与所有其他先知不同。这位先知不会来自下面。这位先知将来自上面。因为祂来自上面,如果你不听祂的话,你就会被完全剪除。

所以我们在说什么?第一点,只有两点。别担心。第一点,圣经说有客观真理,耶稣基督带来它,但所有先知都带来它。现在我们马上会看到为什么耶稣基督是终极的真理带来者,但先知们带来一种真理,它超越所有其他信息来源。

你看,其他世界观讨厌这个想法。他们说,嗯,我们都在竞争。哦,以赛亚,他们对神有一种解释,但莎士比亚也有,我的英语老师也有,我也有。每个人都有自己的解释。圣经说,不,有一些说话的人是先知,他们带来来自上面的真理。因此,那真理超越所有其他真理,所有其他信息来源。你有你的心情,对吧?你有专家意见,你有你成长的传统,你有公众舆论。耶稣的真理,神的真理超越所有其他种类的真理。如果它与公众舆论不同,你必须遵循它。如果它与你的感觉不同,你必须遵循它。那就是真理的本质。那就是,那就是当圣经说有先知,神已经派先知,尽管你杀害了先知,当我把他们派到你那里时,祂说,我会继续把他们派到你那里,因为他们带来真理。你不喜欢超越你的真理的想法,但它确实如此。现在,关于这一点还有一件事。我知道我说的听起来很严厉。神的真理的教义,圣经给我们的神的真理的观念,它是坚硬的,它是不屈的,它有锋利的边缘,它就像咀嚼钻石,我知道。然而,贝多芬呢?我们讨厌这样的想法:有真理,无论我们多么想做这个,我们都不被允许。无论我们多么不想做这个,我们都必须做。

那个想法,我们就是讨厌它。这就是为什么我们喜欢跳进存在主义者。我们喜欢跳进新时代,我们喜欢跳进对任何真理的完全怀疑论,你看。我们就是喜欢那个想法。我们讨厌它是先知的想法。我知道这听起来很严厉,但你对贝多芬怎么办?因为你看,帕斯卡这样说,正如我们有一种无法证明任何东西的无能,任何教条主义都无法克服。听到了吗?他说,一方面,我们真的无法证明任何东西。没有人能证明任何东西。他说,一方面,我们有一种无法证明任何东西的无能,任何教条主义都无法克服。然而。他说,我们有一种关于真理的概念,任何怀疑论都无法克服。我想说的是,你看那些人,也许我知道你们有些人就是这些人。看那些说,啊,没有真理的人,像伯特兰·罗素。看那些说,嗯,真理在内心找到的人。看那些说没有客观真理这种东西的人。然而,每个人,每个人都有一种关于真理的概念,任何怀疑论都无法克服。我们都知道有些事情是对或错,不管人们相信什么。不是吗?有些事情就是错的,我们说。

但如果你不相信一位通过先知说话的神,你就没有基础。你没有相信它的基础。而你不能不相信它。你知道有真理。你知道有一位说话的神。好的。所以首先,我们了解到神通过先知说话。但最后,我们也在这段经文中了解到耶稣是终极的先知。祂是真理的最终启示者。为什么?

你看,注意,尽管祂是先知,它告诉我们祂是所有先知所说的对象。它说,神曾藉众先知的口预言基督将要受害,就这样应验了。所以你们当悔改归正,使你们的罪得以涂抹。换句话说,耶稣基督不仅是预言的主体。祂是预言的对象。祂不仅带来真理,而且祂就是所有先知一直指向的真理。这意味着什么使祂与所有先知不同是简单的。祂不仅是带来真理的那一位。祂就是真理。佛陀、穆罕默德、摩西和亚伯拉罕,他们所有人来,这就是他们说的。他们说,不要看我。我在指向神。我在指向通往神的道路。不要看我。所以我本身什么都不是。我在指向祂。耶稣是第一位先知,祂来说,我在指向我自己。你只能通过我找到神。我就是道路、真理、生命。若不藉着我,没有人能到父那里去。

希伯来书第1章第1节说,这是一件令人惊讶的事。它说,神既在古时藉着众先知多次多方地晓谕列祖,就在这末世,藉着祂儿子晓谕我们,又早已立祂为承受万有的,也曾藉着祂创造诸世界。祂是神荣耀所发的光辉,是神本体的真像。那简直,你知道,对于这样的陈述没有平行。它说,为什么所有其他先知,他们告诉我们的是零碎的,每一位曾经活过的其他先知。事实上,我甚至可以说,任何其他宗教的每一位其他先知都来告诉我们真实的事情。你知道,否则他们永远不会起步。我不是说,穆罕默德说了很多真实的事情。佛陀说了很多真实的事情。他们必须这样,你知道,除非其中有很多真理,非常多,否则你无法让一种宗教起步。

但耶稣是唯一一位来时不是指向祂肩膀后面而是指向祂自己心的人。祂来了说,他们可以告诉你很多关于神的事情,但我可以向你展示神。所以我是终极的启示者。为什么?因为所有其他先知以许多方式在许多地方给我们真理的片段,我们听到,但现在神以这种最终的方式说话了。为什么它是无法超越的?因为祂是神荣耀所发的光辉,是神本体的真像。这就是为什么我们必须说,任何人怎么能在耶稣之后来并添加任何东西?怎么可能?除非三位一体有第四位,那它就不是三位一体了,你看?不,已经有先知了,你知道,穆罕默德后来来了,耶稣是先知,但我超越祂。我是终极的。我带来更高的观点。我带来更好的观点。巴哈欧拉说了同样的话。

整个20世纪人们一直在这样做。你唯一能真正理性地摆脱困境的方法是说,我是神。事实上,我是一个更好的,我是一个更大的,我是神荣耀光辉的更好显现,我是祂本体的更确切的真像,比耶稣更确切。从来没有人敢做出这样的主张,除了疯子。为什么?你无法摆脱困境,除非你是一个该死的道德的、荣耀的人物。你最好是一个令人难以置信的伟大人物。你的智慧、你的美丽、你的吸引力、你的同情心和你的绝对一致性。只有耶稣曾经能够宣称那个并摆脱困境,因为只有耶稣有生命来匹配祂的宣称。因此,祂是神荣耀所发的光辉,是神本体的真像。让我总结一下说,祂不仅是先知,因为作为神,祂向我们展示神是谁,因为祂在说话、行动和移动的方式上如此富有同情心和慈爱。不,最终,耶稣是终极的启示者。嗯,这就是为什么你不能把先知、祭司和君王彼此分开的伟大之处。祂是终极的先知,因为祂是祭司和君王。在十字架上,听着。

其他先知已经告诉我们了,不是吗?神是圣洁的。其他先知已经告诉我们了,不是吗?神是爱。所有宗教的先知都来说,神是圣洁的。祂是公义的。祂恨恶邪恶。祂恨恶罪,对吧?所有先知都来说,神是慈爱的。神是有同情心的。

耶稣也不例外。祂来了,祂说,神恨恶罪。祂也来说,神爱你。祂讲了浪子的比喻。祂展示了当我们回到神那里时,父是如此渴望让我们回来,以至于在我们能说出一半悔改的话之前,祂就跑向我们。祂跳到我们身上,祂亲吻我们的脖子。现在,耶稣,像先知一样,告诉我们那些事情。但耶稣,因为祂是祭司,是终极的先知,因为在十字架上,祂以一种没有先知曾经有过或可能有过的方式展示。祂以一种没有先知曾经有过或可能有过的方式启示。神的绝对荣耀,因为祂在十字架上调和了神的圣洁和爱。历史上唯一的地方,宇宙中唯一的地方,神的圣洁和爱以同等的亮度照耀出来的地方是在十字架上。因为当你理解十字架的逻辑,耶稣为你而死。所以神越多地把祂对罪的愤怒倾倒出来,祂就越多地拯救我们。在十字架上,只有在十字架上,神既是公义的,又是使信者称义的。只有在那里是神的心,祂的本质被启示出来。只有神的真正荣耀。没有其他宗教。没有其他先知。没有任何其他地方像那样向我们展示。为什么?

因为你说耶稣远超过先知。这就是为什么祂是终极的先知。我告诉你,如果你跟随任何其他先知,并使任何其他先知至高无上,任何其他真理源头高于耶稣,你要么会看到神的圣洁或神的爱,但你永远不会同时看到它们。永远不会。你要么是律法主义的人,要么是放纵的人。你会是一个不平衡的人,但你永远不会把它们全部结合在一起。你永远不会看到公义和神的爱如何亲吻、拥抱、哭泣并扑在彼此的脖子上,以至于神可以哭泣并扑在你的脖子上。只有这位先知对行淫时被拿的妇人说,我不定你的罪,但祂说去吧,不要再犯罪了。祂怎么能两者都做呢?十字架。只有祂,在这里我们有神,既是公义的又是使人称义的神。它是无法超越的。它是令人难以置信的。看这位先知的面。看这位神的面,这位先知耶稣基督的面,你就会看到父的面。

祂是吗?听着,耶稣说,这是我的爱子,你们要听祂。让我问你们总结一下。你听了吗?你只是希望耶稣会以某种方式爱你,但你不想学习祂的教导,掌握祂的教导吗?你真的不喜欢祂有权告诉你该做什么的想法吗?我告诉你一件事。你想要祂救赎你吗?你想要祂爱你吗?你想要祂打开一条通往父的道路吗?你必须听祂的话。你必须听祂的话。你必须让祂坚硬的、不屈的客观真理进入你的生命。你愿意这样做吗?因为祂是所有这些东西或祂什么都不是,但因为祂是所有这些东西,祂向我们展示父。祂是绝对的代表,是祂本体的真像,是祂荣耀所发的光辉。让我们祷告。父啊,我们感谢你,这一切都是为了我们,我们感谢你,因为耶稣基督来并死了,你可以看着我们的罪,却扑在我们的脖子上说,穿上我的袍子,戴上我的戒指,让我们宰杀肥牛犊,让我们跳舞歌唱,因为你的心,你的家。父啊,当我们看到耶稣基督,只有当我们看到耶稣基督,我们才能真正看到你,只有祂启示你,只有祂这样做。感谢你的独特性,感谢你对你本体、你光辉和你荣耀的启示的至高无上性。

我们祈祷今晚,我们可能学到的两件事是,我们需要学习圣经,我们需要学习,这是圣经,我们需要彻底了解它。但另一方面,你的儿子,耶稣基督,是至高无上和终极的先知,祂的真理超越所有真理,祂给我们的关于你的画面是可能的至高画面。我们为这伟大的披露感谢你,我们求你帮助我们把它吸收到我们自己的生命中,并被它改变。除了子和子所愿意指示的,没有人知道父。我们奉耶稣的名祷告,阿们。

在今天的播客中，提姆·凯勒要带我们一同思想耶稣这位人和神的应许与位格。每年一月和六月，教会的牧师们都会聚在一起，围绕某个主题做一个短系列的信息。今年一月，我们正在做的这组信息，如果你想知道每一讲的主题是怎么划分、每位牧师是怎样被分配的，你可以翻到周报的最后一页，上面写得很清楚。这一整月，我们都在讲一件事：如何认识耶稣。

有人可能会说：“你们不是一直都在讲如何认识耶稣吗？”是的，但有时候，我们需要被带上一趟“直升机之旅”，从一个更全面的高度，来俯瞰整本圣经关于基督的教义。所谓“基督论”，就是把圣经中关于耶稣的各个面向综合起来看。

圣经告诉我们，耶稣是谁——他的位格：他是真人，也是完全的神。上周在主日早晚堂，斯科特已经从这两个层面来讲论基督的位格。为什么要这样做？因为在某些关键时刻，你若只看见他的人的一面，却看不见他的神性，或者只看见他的神性，却忽略他的人性，你就会落入严重的错误，对基督的认识就会被扭曲。你得出来的东西，不论叫什么，反正不再是基督教了。若不能同时持守这两方面，就不再是圣经所启示的基督。

除了讲他的位格，圣经也告诉我们他所成就的工作。这些工作可以归纳为三大类：他是先知，他是祭司，他是君王。圣经中所有关于耶稣所说、所做的一切，都可以划入这三种身份之一。

因此，花整整一个月的时间，对这三方面的事工做一个全面的巡礼，是非常有益的。让我先为你把整个脉络铺陈一下。当我说“这三样”时，我的意思是：耶稣所做的一切、在圣经中所说的一切，都可以归到这三大范畴之下。而之所以用这三个范畴，是因为它们都极其关键。若少了其中任何一个，哪怕你只抓住其中两个、漏掉了第三个，你对现实的看法就会被扭曲；你最终得到的，就不再是基督教，而是一种对灵魂有毒的混合物。

举几个例子就会很清楚。先从这三个身份的定义说起。我们说耶稣是先知、是祭司、是君王。作为先知，他是启示者，是那位把真理启示出来的主。他向我们显明神是谁、神的旨意是什么——这就是先知职分。

其次，他是祭司，也就是救赎者、代求者。他作为代表站在我们的位置上。作为先知，他是代表神来到我们中间；但作为祭司，他是代表我们来到神面前。作先知时，他从神那里来，对你我说话；作祭司时，他为你我向父神说话。他代替我们而立，他在我们的位份上受死。他带我们归向神，是我们的辩护者、代表、救赎主。

所以，首先，他是先知——启示者；其次，他是祭司——救赎者；第三，他是君王——统治者。他吩咐我们，我们当把最高的忠诚献给他，他在我们生命中拥有至高的权柄。

所以，他同时是先知、祭司、君王——启示者、救赎者与统治者。现在让我给你看，如果你把其中任何一个抽掉，会发生什么事。

在纽约，我遇见过许多这样的人。我最近读了一本书，更是促使我多想这个问题。那本书叫《五十年代的纽约》（New York in the 50s），作者丹·韦克菲尔德（Dan Wakefield）曾在五十年代初就读哥伦比亚大学，住在格林威治村，成为“垮掉的一代”以及波西米亚圈中的一员，是个作家。读这本书时，我愈发意识到：我所遇见的许多人，其实都走过类似的路。

他们从美国中部来到纽约；在中部，他们多半有相当正统的基督教背景。但来到纽约之后，却几乎把那一切全都抛在脑后，不仅轻视童年时的信仰，也轻视中产阶级的价值观，轻视那种“大众美国”的同质文化。

他们一头栽进纽约丰富多元的思想、文化与族群当中，并且常常带着一种优越感，觉得自己已经超越了原来生活的世界。

我常会和这样的人聊天——你们当中有的人就是这样的人。许多人会对我说：“我不再去教会了，我大致上就是照着自己觉得对的方式来生活，我也不知道自己到底还相信些什么。但有一件事我仍然觉得是真的：小时候，我曾经‘决定’跟随基督，我仍然觉得他是站在我这边的。我总觉得，他还是与我同在。”

换句话说，来到纽约之后，他的感觉、经历和情绪成了他生命中的“君王”，也成了他的“先知”。他自己决定什么对他来说是真实的，他自己决定该怎么活。但他依然想保留一个观念：耶稣是“救赎主”。他不要耶稣作他的君王，也不要耶稣作他的先知——他不要耶稣来告诉他什么是真理，也不要耶稣对他发出任何命令；但他仍旧喜欢那种“耶稣爱我、赦免我、永远与我同在”的感觉。

这不是基督教。那是另外一种东西，但绝不是基督教。你不能只要耶稣作你的祭司，而不要他作先知和君王；不能只要他作救赎者，却不肯让他作启示者、统治者。

我叫 Timothy James Keller。如果有人对我说：“进来吧，James，Timothy 和 Keller 都留在外面。”那我就尴尬了。我不会说：“好吧，其实我也是可以切割的，看看我哪一部分是 James，也许是我的左臂，你就只要左臂好了。”事情当然不是这样的。我整个人就是 Timothy，也是 James，也是 Keller，这三者是不可分的。

同样地，耶稣也是完全的先知、完全的祭司、完全的君王；你不可能只要他的一部分。

再举一个例子，这次我说得简短一点。有不少团体——可以说是一些教会——非常高举耶稣。他们对耶稣作为“君王、命令者”的观念发展得很充分，可是他们对耶稣作为“祭司、代求者、救赎主”的理解却非常贫乏。在那些律法主义浓厚的团体里，

在那些地方，人们总是被“耶稣说……耶稣说……”这样的话砸得头昏脑胀，讲道的语言也许非常生动、有想象力，却几乎从不真实谈论他的救赎、他的恩典、他的慈爱——即便提到，也只是抽象的概念。

只高举耶稣为“君王”，却不把他当作先知和祭司来认识，是极其可怕的一种处境；那根本不是真正的耶稣。

再举一个例子：就像律法主义群体只强调他是君王，却轻忽他作祭司的身份；又像放纵、放浪形骸的人，只想要他作祭司，不愿意承认他是君王和启示者；同样，在今天，还有许多人只愿意承认耶稣是先知，却不愿意承认他是祭司与君王。

他们会说：“我相信耶稣是一位伟大的老师，我相信他向我们启示了许多关于神的重要真理。但我实在很难接受他是神性的救主、神性的君王这一整套说法。”

现代基督教文学中有一段非常著名的论述，出自 C.S. 路易斯在《返璞归真》（Mere Christianity）中的一章。他指出：有一件事是你绝不可能只停留在“耶稣只是先知”的立场上。

路易斯怎么说呢？他说，问题在于：这位“先知”耶稣来到世上时，说了这样的话——“我是神，你们必须敬拜我；只有我能赦免你们的罪；你们怎样看待我，将决定你们的永恒归宿。”

换句话说，这个人带着一连串惊人的宣告出现：宣称自己是神，宣称自己必须成为你生命中最终的权威，宣称你要么因他而被举起，要么因他而跌倒。

路易斯于是提出一个很显然的结论：如果这些宣称都是真的，那么耶稣要么远远“超过”先知，要么就远远“不及”先知，但绝不可能“只是”先知。若他真是神、真是你生命的终极审判者和拯救者，那他就远远超越先知；否则，如果这些宣称都是假的，那他要么疯了，要么是个骗子，一个愚昧至极的人——那他就连一位合格的先知都算不上。要么他远比先知伟大，要么我们根本不能信他所说的任何一句话；但有一件事是他绝不会允许我们做的：那就是只把他当作先知，而拒绝承认他是祭司与君王。

你看，当你只抓住其中一个身分，或者只抓住其中两个、却刻意排斥第三个，甚至只是对其中一个认识得很清楚，却对另两个只有模模糊糊的观念，这都会在你的生命里带来扭曲。

事实上，我认为——虽然今晚没办法展开讲——作为一位牧师，我完全可以为自己设计一套“评估网格”，帮助信徒弄清楚自己灵命到底哪里出了问题。我说的是已经信主的人。

当我们回头审视自己的属灵光景，问：“到底哪里不对劲？我需要在哪些地方成长？我生命的哪一个环节出现了压力裂缝？哪里在崩塌、在腐蚀，哪里显出明显的软弱？”——在绝大多数情况下，你都可以用这张“先知—祭司—君王”的网格来分析。

我们很多人对耶稣在其中一个身分上的认识颇为扎实，对另一个也有一些认识，但第三个就非常薄弱。你们当中有些人特别热衷查经，很喜欢研究圣经、钻研主的话，把耶稣当作“先知”看得很重，你对他的教导非常熟悉；然而，你却并没有真正活在顺服这位“君王”的生命之中。

也有些人恰恰相反：你非常强调顺服，把耶稣当作“君王”来对待，在行为上也努力遵行他的命令，可是你里面却充满了内疚、焦虑，被沉重的自我控告压得透不过气来，因为你并没有真正把他当作“祭司、救赎主”来认识——你对他作中保、作代求者的理解非常贫乏。

你看，就是这三方面——这也是为什么我们要用几个星期、几篇讲道的时间，专门来谈每一方面：他是先知，他是祭司，他是君王。

说完这些，为这整个月做了一个大的铺垫，今晚我要做的一件事就是：虽然耶稣远远不止是一位先知，但他的确是先知——那这到底意味着什么？

接下来，让我终于来读一段圣经经文。是的，我还是有讲道经文的。我们来看《使徒行传》第三章 17–26 节。我刚才所说的是整个月系列信息的引言。现在，让我们读《使徒行传》三章 17–26 节，并从中抓出两大重点，帮助我们认识耶稣如何作为“那位至大、最终极的先知”，向我们启示神。

经文这样说，从第 17 节开始：

“弟兄们，我晓得你们作这事是出于不知，你们的官长也是如此。但神曾借众先知的口预言基督将要受害，就这样应验了。你们当悔改归正，使你们的罪得以涂抹，这样，那安舒的日子就必从主面前来到；主也必差遣所预定给你们的基督，就是耶稣。天必留他，等到万物复兴的时候，就是神从创世以来，借着圣先知的口所说的。

摩西曾说：‘主神要从你们弟兄中间给你们兴起一位先知像我，凡他向你们所说的，你们都要听从。凡不听从那先知的人，必要从民中全然灭绝。’

从撒母耳以来的众先知，凡说预言的，也都说到这些日子。你们是先知的子孙，也是神与你们祖宗所立之约的子孙，神曾对亚伯拉罕说：‘地上万族都要因你的后裔得福。’神既兴起他的仆人，就先差他到你们这里来，赐福给你们，叫你们各人回转，离开罪恶。”

在这段经文里，我们首先看见一个非常明显的事实：耶稣基督确实是那位先知，他不仅是祭司和君王，也是真正的先知。彼得引用摩西的话说：“主你的神要从你们弟兄中间给你们兴起一位先知像我，你们要听从他的一切话；凡不听从那先知的人，必从民中全然灭绝。”

摩西的意思是：你们以为我是一位伟大的先知，但终有一位要来的先知，超越一切先知。他像我，却又远远高于我；他的权柄是至高无上的，他所带来的真理是根本性的、关键性的，以至于你与他的关系，将完全决定你是否被接纳、还是被剪除。”

彼得在这里说：那一位，就是耶稣。耶稣就是那位要来的先知。

那这告诉了我们什么呢？第一点，仅仅从“耶稣是先知”这一事实，就已经看见：我们的神是一位说话的神，他乐意向人启示。自从世界起初，

从人类历史一开始，就可以看见：人心深处都极其渴望有一个会对我们“说话”的宇宙。我们盼望这个世界能回应我们。你去读人类的文学作品、听我们的歌曲，从古到今，我们总是幻想会说话的树、会说话的动物。

就连在科幻小说里，我们也不断想象来自其他星球的智慧种族。我们对一种可能性感到深深的恐惧：也许，整个宇宙当中只有我们会说话；也许，这其实是一个冷冰冰、沉默无声的宇宙；也许，在最深处根本没有“那一位”可以让我们对话，没有任何“理性他者”存在。

但圣经说：事实不是这样。之所以你如此渴望有一个“会对你说话的宇宙”、如此渴望有一个能回应你的对象，是因为确实有这样一位存在。

我很欣赏作曲家伦纳德·伯恩斯坦（Leonard Bernstein）的一段话。他说：“我不信圣经，我并不相信那一套。”然而，他又说，当他聆听贝多芬的音乐时，会有一种非常强烈的感觉——让我念一下那段经典的话：“（贝多芬的音乐）让我们感到，这个世界上必定有某种东西是对的，是内在一贯、处处相合的；有一种东西遵循着自己的律法，始终如一，是可以信靠、不会让我们失望的。”

换句话说，他口头上说自己不相信“绝对真理”，不相信有一套内在自洽、绝对一致的真理体系，也不相信有一个永远可靠、绝不辜负我们的终极实在。但当他听到贝多芬的音乐时，却又深深觉得：“那种东西一定存在。”

圣经说，你之所以会渴望有会说话的树、渴望有一个会对你说话的宇宙、渴望有一个能与我们理性对话的中心，是因为这样的实在的确存在。即使在理性上，你说自己拒绝一切“绝对真理”，拒绝“说话的上帝”这个观念；但当你听见贝多芬，当你被某种美深深震撼时，你内心却在呐喊：“不可能只是我们这些有限的人，在一个非理性的宇宙里苦苦挣扎；不可能只有我们这些‘有位格者’，却身处一个无情、无个性的宇宙；不可能只有我们这些会说话者，却活在一个永远沉默的世界里——我无法相信那样的图景。”

圣经说：你之所以无法真正相信那样的世界图景，你之所以心底总是渴望、总觉得“应该有别的什么”，那股直觉从哪里来？就是因为那是真的——因为你在深处知道，有一位神在说话。

这位神透过耶稣向我们说话。当耶稣在变像山上变像时，你还记得那一幕吗？彼得、雅各、约翰看见耶稣，同时也看见摩西在他一旁，以利亚在另一旁——旧约最伟大的两位先知站在两侧，而耶稣站在中间。此时有声音从天上出来，你还记得那声音说什么吗？天父说：“这是我的爱子，你们要听他！”

“你们要听他。”你不能只把耶稣当成某种模糊的神秘象征。他是一位老师，是一位先知，他带来真理，而你与天父的关系是透过这位先知来建立的。这意味着，你和神的关系不只是某种含糊的“合一感”、某种朦胧的“灵性体验”，而是建立在“沟通与回应”之上的关系——是建立在一套可以被听见、被理解、被顺服的真理之上的关系。

这是一种理性、有秩序的关系；有一整套由这位先知带来的真理，是你与神相交的根基。你不能只是在大自然的美景中“感受”一下，然后就说：“我在这里与神相交。”那不是圣经所说，我们如何与“天父上帝”建立关系的方式。

天父说：“这是我的爱子，你们要听他。”——他是一位先知。

所以，接下来我要谈的两件事是：第一，圣经所谓的“先知”到底是什么意思？第二，为什么耶稣是那位终极的先知？圣经清楚教导：他是“最后的一位”先知。

这也是基督教与其他宗教的重大分水岭之一。伊斯兰教会说耶稣是一位先知，却不会承认他是“最后的一位先知”。许多其他宗教也会说耶稣是先知，却不会承认他是最终极的先知。

基督信仰却宣称：耶稣基督以一种“无法被超越的方式”启示神；他所带来的神的启示是“顶点性的”，再没有任何启示可以在他之上。接下来，我会解释为什么。

但先从第一个问题开始：什么是先知？圣经是怎样描述先知的？第二，为什么耶稣是那位终极先知？

第一，什么是先知？你会注意到，在这段经文里，“先知”这个词被多次提到。彼得说，耶稣就是摩西所预言要来的那位先知；同时，这段经文也让我们看到先知在做什么。

请看第 18 节（如果你手上有圣经的话）：这里说，“神曾借众先知的口预言……”——注意，不是“众先知预言了什么”，而是“神借着他们预言了什么”。有时圣经会直接说“先知预言了什么”，但同时也清楚表明：先知所说的话，其实就是神所说的。

如果你要寻找一个关于“什么是先知、什么是预言”的最佳圣经理解，可以回到出埃及记里的一段故事。那时，神差遣摩西去见法老，叫他向法老说话。摩西却说：“你不知道，我这个人很不会讲话，我不善辞令，我一站到台前就紧张，我不行。”

神怎么回应？他说：“好，那就让亚伦陪你去。亚伦比你更善于说话。”于是神说了一句很关键的话（出埃及记 7 章）：

“我要使你在法老面前代替神，你的哥哥亚伦要作你的先知。你要将当说的一切话告诉他，由他转告法老。”

你看，图像非常清楚：在那一幕里，摩西好比“神”，亚伦好比“先知”；摩西把话告诉亚伦，亚伦再把话转述给法老。也就是说：先知就是“神的口舌”，是那位把神的话带出来的人。

现代人通常不相信圣经对“先知”的这种理解。现代人看圣经，会说：“好，旧约里有很多先知，他们写下了我们现在读到的这些书卷——以赛亚、何西阿、俄巴底亚……这些人写下了他们对上帝的理解。”换句话说，在现代人的眼中，这些先知只是一些属灵的思想家，他们给出了自己对神的诠释。

于是我们会说：“很好，我们当然可以向这些古代圣贤学习，但我们每个人也都有权利，对神做出自己的诠释嘛。”图像就好像这样：假设肖斯塔科维奇写了一首新的交响曲——（虽然他已经去世了，大概也写不了新的交响曲了，但就假设一下）——而你是报社的乐评人，你去听了首演，然后写下一篇评论。

你听完演出，回到家里，就坐下来写评论。你可能会写道：“我认为第一乐章是在描写一个被捆绑、受奴役的人；第二乐章则是在描写这个人如何挣脱束缚、获得自由。”于是，你把自己的诠释写出来，发表在报纸上。

许多人就用类似的方式来理解圣经中的先知：他们认为，以赛亚、何西阿这些人不过是写下了自己对上帝的理解——“在我看来，神大概是这样；在我看来，神大概是那样。”而我们每个人当然也都有权利，写出自己对“这位作曲家”的解读，对吧？

但是，假如有一天，你不是去问乐评人，而是去请肖斯塔科维奇本人为报纸写一篇“自我评论”。你对他说：“肖斯塔科维奇先生，请你告诉我们：在第一乐章里，你想表达什么？在第二乐章里，你又想表达什么？”——然后，他亲自写下来。

这和前面的情况就完全不同了，对不对？现在不是乐评人的主观揣测，而是“作曲家亲口说明”。当作曲家清楚写出“我在这里要表达的，就是这个意思”时，所有关于“他到底想表达什么”的争论基本上就结束了；你不能再说，“我不太认同他自己说的，我觉得其实他想表达的是别的意思。”——因为现在，我们已经从他本人口中得知他的意图了。

那么，当先知在圣经里写下神的话时，我们该如何理解？我们要把他们当成“乐评人”，只是对某位“神圣作曲家”做诠释吗？还是要把他们看作“作曲家的扩音器”，只是把作曲家的旋律和意念，用自己的口讲出来？

圣经自己给了非常清楚的答案，尤其是在彼得后书 1 章 21 节：“预言从来没有出于人意的，乃是人被圣灵感动，说出神的话来。”——不是先知自己随意解释，而是他们在圣灵的感动下，把神的心意说出来。

当你听过浪子回头的比喻时，你也许以为，那个故事只是关于一个迷失的小儿子。其实不然。耶稣讲这个比喻，其实是同时对两种人说话：一方面是那些远远逃离神、显然走偏路线的“浪子”；另一方面也是对那些试图靠“做好人”来赚取神喜悦的“长子”说话。

在《浪子的上帝》（The Prodigal God）这本书中，提姆·凯勒解释了这则著名比喻如何揭示福音的核心：这是一个同时对“放纵的浪子”和“自义的长子”发出的盼望之讯息，也是邀请所有人来经历父神那种“挥霍般丰盛”的恩典。无论你已经信主，还是仍在探索信仰，这本书都会帮助你用全新的眼光来看待自己与基督的关系。

《浪子的上帝》是我们本月为支持“福音与人生”（Gospel in Life）事工而特别准备的感谢礼。当你奉献支持我们，将基督恩典与盼望的信息传递给全球更多人时，你就可以索取这本书。

我之所以在这里提这件事，是因为有一个观念，我们必须不时地重新提起——那就是“真理”的观念。对现代人的心态来说，“真理”这个词几乎是本能地让人反感；我们是一群生活在高度现代化城市里的现代人——也许纽约是全世界“最现代”的城市之一——但圣经说，耶稣是先知，圣经是“先知的话”，意思就是：先知所传讲的，正是神自己的话。

你看第 18 节说：“神曾借众先知的口预言……”——是神借着他们说，不是他们先有主意再请神背书。先知所说的，就是神所说的。因此，在基督信仰里，“真理”的概念是这样的：这是真正“客观的真理”。这不是某个属灵人的私下诠释，而是神自己的心意。

换句话说，我们真的可以知道神在某些事情上的想法。

很多人一听到基督徒这么说，就会立即反驳：“你们怎么敢说自己知道上帝怎么想？你们以为你们是谁？”——而基督徒能够回答的，只有类似这样的话：“是的，在某些事情上，我的确相信我们可以知道神的心意；不是因为我们比较聪明、比较属灵，而是因为我相信这位神是‘可被认识的’，是一位说话的神；他不是一位躲躲藏藏、不肯启示自己的神。”

区别不在于谁比较骄傲，而在于你相不相信这位上帝愿意说话，愿意把真理启示出来。

所以，是的，基督徒相信：在许多关键的事上，我们可以知道神怎么看，因为我们相信这位神是“说话的神”，而不是一个沉默的、遥远的、被动的存在。

当基督徒开始明白“先知性真理”的观念——也就是：神已经说话了，神赐下了客观真理——你就会开始看见，在像纽约这样的城市里，有两种与基督信仰彼此竞争的“世界观”特别明显地存在着。

我时不时会提到这两种世界观。不幸的是，每次给它们起的名字都有点不一样，所以有些人以为我讲了七八种，其实只有两种。

第一种，有时我们称之为“自然主义”（naturalism），因为它认为“自然界就是一切”，除了自然界之外没有别的。有时也叫它“世俗主义”或“科学主义”，意思都是差不多的：否认任何超自然、任何灵界的存在——除了物质和能量之外，一切都不存在。

第二种，是与之相反的“泛神论”（pantheism），也就是“万物皆神”的观念；我有时会称它为“新纪元灵性”（new ageism），这可能让人更迷惑。但基本意思是：神在一切之中，万物都有神性。

表面上看，这两种观念截然不同。第一种说：“没有神，什么都不是神。”第二种说：“一切都是神，神是一种弥散在万有之中的力量。”

于是，第一种世界观会说：“没有所谓的‘真理’，只有‘事实’。我们可以通过科学得到某些事实的数据，但不存在什么终极真理或终极实在。”——伯特兰·罗素就说过，当宇宙终结的那一天到来时，一切文明都将随之消失；既然如此，就没有所谓“对与错”，没有灵魂、没有目的、没有人生意义。罗素说，只有当你把人生建构在这种认知上——也就是“无可避免的绝望”的基础上——你才算是真正面对现实；不要被任何关于“意义”的话蒙骗，也不要相信有什么“对与错”的客观标准，我们不过是一团团分子而已，如此而已。

另一种世界观则说：“不，神在万物之中，事实上，你就是神。”它宣称，人需要通过改变意识状态、进入某种“更高的意识层次”，向内翻照自己，从而与自己的“伟大潜能”、自己的创造力和神性接触。

听起来，这两种观念差异极大，彼此也常常厌恶对方，动不动就在电视节目上辩论、互相攻击。一方说：“你们这些人什么都信！”另一方则反唇相讥：“你们这些人什么都不信！”——一方好像什么都不相信，另一方则似乎把什么都当成“神圣”的。

什么都相信的一派。前面那一派是什么都不信；而这一派呢，就说，去翻塔罗牌呀、水晶球呀、通灵呀，还有什么，敬拜自然呀，对，对，什么都行。一派是否认一切，另一派则是凡事都信。一派说没有上帝，另一派说一切都是神。看上去他们很不一样。

但你看，在实际操作层面，在实践中，最后却会落到同一个地方。两边最后都归结到这一点：你是你自己的真理发现者，你是你自己的真理带来者。一方面，你看像伯特兰·罗素会说：“你自己决定你要怎样活。”没有什么绝对的是非。另一方面，他们会说：“你必须向内看，发掘你真正是谁，你究竟是什么。”但归根到底，在这两种情形里，都不存在一个我们必须顺服的、在我们之外的真理。你是你自己的真理发现者，你是你自己的真理带来者。而且——听着——其中一种看上去还特别高尚。

他们对我们说，对基督徒说：“是，是，如果你需要一个对上帝的信仰，来面对生命的无意义和绝望，那也可以。”你知道，听起来是多么高尚，多么……他们看上去多么坚强、多么勇敢。另一方面，那些泛神论、新纪元思潮的人又显得那么异国情调、那么正面积极、那么深邃，你看。但我想说，人们拒绝基督教对真理的理解，在背后其实有一些非常粗俗的动机。因为在我们里面最深处，有一个很幼稚的部分，就是不愿意任何人告诉我们该做什么。无论这种思想听起来多么知识分子化、多么高尚、多么积极、多么深刻，它完完全全迎合了这些粗俗的动机，正好落入这些粗俗动机的手里。

我读的一本书，是丹·韦克菲尔德写的《五十年代的纽约》。丹·韦克菲尔德是个来自中西部的人，他来到哥伦比亚大学，开始阅读存在主义哲学家，结果他开始意识到，宇宙、整个秩序都是毫无意义的，存在是荒谬的，每个人都必须找到属于自己的真理，你知道。于是他就下到格林威治村，开始随心所欲地活，想怎么活就怎么活。他说，

他的那些朋友会从印第安纳来看他。

有一次有个女的从印第安纳来，跟他一起在纽约待了几个礼拜。她说：“丹尼，纽约太有思想了，太有学问了，又那么匿名，我都不知道该先犯哪一条罪才好。”而他说，事实上，纽约真正给我们的，是一个思想构架，让我们可以心安理得地去做那些在印第安纳老家、我们的父母绝对不会允许我们做的事。

所以很多人会说：“哦，你们这些基督徒，你们当然有想要相信基督的动机，你们当然有想要相信圣经真的是上帝之道的动机。你们渴望生命中有权威，你们渴望生命中有确定性。”嗯，是的，没错，那里当然有动机。那么，你拒绝‘真理’这个概念的时候，你的动机又是什么呢？你看，你也有巨大的动机。尤其是大学生们，他们特别喜欢要么投入自然主义，要么投入泛神论。为什么？因为现在我就可以去做所有那些父母从来不让我做的事了。终于，我可以为所欲为。

没有什么比这更粗鄙，也没有什么比这更幼稚的了。换个说法吧：你八岁的儿子打完棒球回家。他对你说：“哎呀，今天我差点跟人打起来。”你说：“怎么了，宝贝？”

“我在绕过三垒的时候，有个男孩把我绊倒了。”

“那你怎么办？”

“我站起来，抓起一块大石头，用力往他头上砸过去，差一点砸中。他很生气，我们就打起来了。”

于是你说：“儿子，那是完全、绝对错误的。他做的是错的，但你做的——你可能会把他砸死啊！那完全不成比例，完全失了分寸，是错的，永远都是错的。你要是一直这样反应，你这一生都会被毁掉。你如果觉得可以用那种方式回应别人，你就会毁了自己的人生。”

那你的儿子会说什么？“你又没在场，你不知道。你凭什么告诉我该怎么做？”这就是人心的运作方式，你看。这就是人心的本质。

那你会对孩子说什么？你会说：“我四十岁，你八岁。我是从上面来的，你是从下面来的。我能看见一些你根本看不见的东西。”

我是非常严肃地说的。虽然听起来好笑，确实也挺好笑，你可以笑，但这事一点也不轻率。你对孩子说：“我从一个你无法想象的制高点在看人生。所以，如果你不听我的话，如果你拒绝我的话，你的人生就会一团糟。”

在约翰福音第 8 章里，耶稣说：“我是世界的光，我所说的一切都是真的。若是你拒绝我的真理，你必要死在罪中。”

这里又怎么说呢？经文说：“主你的神要从你们弟兄中间给你兴起一位先知。”但这一位先知和所有其他先知都不一样。这位先知不是从下面来的，这位先知是从上面来的。正因为他是从上面来的，如果你不听从他，你就会被完全剪除。

那么我们在说什么呢？第一点，其实只有两点，不要担心。第一点，圣经说，真理是客观存在的，耶稣基督把它带来了，所有先知也把它带来了。我们一会儿会看到，为什么耶稣基督是终极的真理带来者，但先知们带来的真理，胜过一切其他信息来源。

别的世界观讨厌这个观念。他们说：“哦，我们都在竞争。好吧，以赛亚有他对上帝的诠释，但莎士比亚也有，我的英文老师也有，我自己也有。每个人都有自己的理解嘛。”圣经却说，不，确实有人曾说过话，他们是先知，他们从上面带来真理。

因此，这真理凌驾于所有其他真理、所有其他信息来源之上。你有自己心里的冲动，对吧？你有专家意见，你有从小受的传统，还有公众舆论。耶稣的真理、神的真理，高过所有其他“真理”。如果它和公众舆论不一样，你就得跟随它；如果它和你的感觉不一样，你也得跟随它。这就是真理的本质。这就是当圣经说有先知、说神差遣先知时所意味着的：虽然你们杀了我所差来的先知，他说，我却要不断地再差来，因为他们带来真理。你不喜欢这种

会凌驾于你的真理观，但它确实如此。

再多说一点。

我知道我刚才讲的这些听起来很尖锐。圣经给我们的那种“神真理”的教义，那种真理观，是坚硬的，是不妥协的，有锋利的棱角，好像在咀嚼一颗钻石。我知道。但那贝多芬又该怎么办呢？

我们讨厌这样的思想：有一种真理存在，不管我多想做这件事，我都不可以做；不管我多不想做那件事，我却必须去做。我们痛恨这种观念。这就是为什么我们那么乐意跳进存在主义的怀抱，为什么那么爱扑向新纪元，或者干脆投入对一切真理的彻底怀疑。我们就是喜欢这种感觉，讨厌“先知”这个想法——讨厌有一个真理权威在我们之上。

我知道听起来很严厉，但贝多芬怎么办？

帕斯卡这样说：“正如我们对于证明任何事毫无能力，这种无能是再多的教条主义也不能克服的；同样，我们里面也有一个关于真理的观念，是再多的怀疑主义也不能压制的。”

听见了吗？他是在说，一方面，我们确实没法彻底证明什么——没人能真的证明一切。他说，一方面，我们在证明上的无能，是任何再强硬的教条主义都无法克服的；然而，另一方面，我们对真理的直觉，是任何再极端的怀疑主义都无法消除的。

我的意思是：看看那些人——也许你自己就属于其中之一。看看那些说“啊，哪里有什么真理”的人，比如伯特兰·罗素；再看看那些说“真理在你里面”的人；看看那些说“没有所谓客观真理”的人。然而，每一个人，每一个人心里都有一个关于真理的观念，是任何怀疑都无法抹去的。我们都知道，有些事不论人们当时怎么想、怎么信，就是错的，对吗？有些事就是错，就是不对，我们会这么说。

可如果你不相信有一位神借着先知说话，你就没有任何基础来坚持这一点。你没有立场说这些话，而你却又无法不相信。你知道有真理，你知道有一位神在说话。

好，所以第一，我们学到的是：神借着先知说话。但最后，在这段经文里，我们也看见，耶稣是那位终极的先知。

他是那位最终、完全启示真理的主。为什么呢？

你看，虽然他是先知，这里却告诉我们，他正是所有先知所指向的那一位。经文说：“这样，神就成就了他借众先知所预先说的话，说他的基督必须受害。你们当悔改归向神，使你们的罪得以涂抹。”换句话说，耶稣基督不仅是预言的主题，他还是预言的对象。他不仅把真理带来，他自己就是所有先知一直以来所指向的那位真理。

这意味着什么使他与所有其他先知不同呢？很简单：他不只是带来真理的那一位，他自己就是那真理。佛陀、穆罕默德、摩西、亚伯拉罕，他们都来了，他们都这样说：“不要看我，我只是指向神，我只是指向一条通往神的道路。不要看我，我本身算不得什么，我只是指向他。”

耶稣却是第一位这样来的先知，他说：“我要你们注视的是我。你只有借着我才能找到神。我就是道路、真理、生命；若不借着我，没有人能到父那里去。”

希伯来书一章一节说了一件惊人的事：“神既在古时借着众先知，多次多方地晓谕列祖，就在这末世借着他儿子晓谕我们；他是神荣耀所发的光辉，是神本体的真像。”

这句话在历史上前所未有。它在说，以前所有先知所讲的，都是片段式的。凡是世上有过的所有先知——事实上，我甚至可以说，来自任何宗教的所有先知——他们所说的，里面都有真理。你知道，否则那宗教根本起不来。我并不是说穆罕默德说的全都错，佛教也有许多对的地方。他们必须讲出很多真相——否则根本不会有人跟随，一个宗教不可能在完全没有真理的情况下发展起来，里面必然充满了大量的真理。

但只有耶稣出现时，不是叫你看他肩膀后面，而是叫你看他自己的心。他是那位说：“他们只能告诉你许多关于神的事，但我可以把神显给你看。”

所以他说：“我是那终极的启示者。”为什么？因为其他所有先知，只是在许多地方、用许多方式，给我们一些真理的片段；但如今，神在这个最终极的方式里向我们说话。

这启示为什么是不可超越的呢？因为他自己就是神荣耀所发的光辉，是神本体的真像。所以我们必须说：在耶稣之后，还能有谁来再加添什么吗？怎么可能呢？除非有“第四位”三一里的位格——那就不再是“三一”了，你看。

不，确实有一些后来的人自称是先知——穆罕默德来到，说：“是，耶稣是先知，但我胜过他。我才是最终极的，我带来更高、更完善的启示。”巴哈欧拉也说了类似的话。二十世纪以来一直有人这么做。理性地说，你唯一能“合理地”这么说的方式，就是说：“我就是神；事实上，我是一个比耶稣更大、更好地彰显神荣耀的存在，我比他更准确地代表神的本体。”

除了疯子以外，没有人敢这么说。为什么？因为你要敢这么说，你的人格、品德就得无比高尚、无比荣耀。你的智慧、你的美、你吸引人的地方，你的怜悯、你绝对的一致性，都必须伟大到不可思议。只有耶稣敢这样宣称，而且没有破绽，因为只有他的生命配得上他的宣称。

因此，他真是神荣耀所发的光辉，是神本体的真像。

让我最后这样说：他不仅是先知，因为作为神，他藉着自己的说话、行事、举动、态度向我们显明神的样式。最终，耶稣之所以是终极的启示者，是因为他既是祭司，又是君王，也正因此他才是终极的先知。在十字架上——听好了——其他先知都告诉过我们：神是圣洁的；其他先知也说过：神是慈爱的。在各宗教中，先知都曾说过：神是圣洁、公义，他恨恶邪恶，恨恶罪，对吧？也说过：神是有爱的，神是怜悯的。

耶稣作为先知，同样也说：神恨恶罪；他也说：神爱你。他讲过浪子回头的比喻，说明当我们回到神那里时，父是多么渴望我们回家，以至于在我们还没来得及把悔改的话说完，他就跑向我们，扑在我们身上，亲吻我们的颈项。

耶稣像一位先知一样，把这些都告诉了我们。但因为他同时是祭司，他就成了那位终极的先知。因为在十字架上，他以一种任何先知从未、也永远不能做到的方式，向我们显明了神荣耀的极致——他把神的圣洁与神的慈爱在十字架上调和在一起。

在整个历史与宇宙当中，只有一个地方——只有十字架——是神的圣洁与神的慈爱以同等光辉照耀出来的地方。因为当你明白十字架的逻辑时，你就会知道：耶稣替你而死。所以，神越是倾倒他的愤怒在罪上，就越是拯救我们。在十字架上，而且只在十字架上，神既完全公义，又完全称那信耶稣的人为义。只有在十字架上，神心的本质、他的内在被显露出来，只有在那里，他真正的荣耀得以显明。

世上没有别的宗教，没有别的先知，没有任何其他地方，能像十字架那样向我们启示这一切。为什么？因为我们说，耶稣远不止是一位先知，这正是他成为终极先知的原因。

我告诉你，如果你把任何其他先知放在至高的位置，如果你把任何其他的真理来源抬举得超过耶稣，你顶多只能看见神的圣洁，或是神的慈爱其中一面，但绝不会同时看见这两者。绝不会。你不是走向律法主义，就是落入放纵；你会成为一个失衡的人。你永远不会真正看见，这两者——神的公义与神的慈爱——是怎样亲吻、拥抱、彼此伏在对方颈项上痛哭，以至于神也能伏在你的颈项上痛哭、拥抱你。

只有这位先知对那犯奸淫被抓的女人说：“我也不定你的罪”，同时又说：“去吧，从此不要再犯罪了。”他怎么能两者都说？答案是十字架。

只有在这里，只有在十字架上，我们才有一位既公义又称人义的神。这启示无可匹敌，令人难以置信。仰望这位先知的面容，仰望这位神——这位先知耶稣基督的面容——你就会看见天父的面容。

他就是那位先知。听着：天父说：“这是我的爱子，你们要听他。”让我最后问你：你听吗？

你只是希望耶稣“爱你一下”，却并不想研究他的教导、掌握他的教导吗？你其实并不喜欢他有权柄告诉你该怎么活吗？我告诉你一件事：你若想要他救赎你，想要他爱你，想要他为你开一条通向父的道路，你就必须听他。你必须听他的声音，你必须让他那坚硬、不妥协、客观的真理进入你的生命。你愿意吗？

因为他要么就是这一切，要么就什么都不是；但正因为他确实就是这一切，他就向我们显明父神。他是那位完全的、准确的神本体之像，是那荣耀所发的光辉。

让我们祷告。

父啊，我们感谢你，这一切都是为着我们；我们感谢你，因为耶稣基督来了、并且为我们而死，你就可以看见我们的罪，却仍然伏在我们的颈项上，抱住我们，说：“把我的袍子披在他身上，把戒指戴在他手上，把那只肥牛犊牵来宰了，我们可以吃喝快乐，因为这个人是我的人，他回家了。”

父啊，当我们看见耶稣基督的时候，也唯有当我们看见耶稣基督的时候，我们才真正看见你。只有他把你启示出来，只有他做得到。我们为他那独一无二、至高无上的启示，向你献上感谢。

我们祈求，今晚我们能学会两件事：第一，我们需要研读圣经，我们需要研读你的话语，我们需要把它熟读于心；第二，你的儿子耶稣基督是那至高、终极的先知，他的真理超越一切其他真理，他向我们所显出的你，是一切可能启示中最高、最完全的图画。

我们为这一伟大的启示向你献上感谢，也求你帮助我们把它带进自己的生命里，从而被它改变。除了子以外，没有人认识父；子愿意把父显明给谁，谁就能认识他。我们奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。

---

这位先知——这位耶稣基督的面容，你就会看见父神的面容。

他就是。听着——天父说：“这是我的爱子，你们要听他。”

最后我要问你：你听吗？你只是盼望耶稣多少爱你一点，却并不想去研读他的教训，不想把他的教导烂熟于心吗？你其实不喜欢他有权利来告诉你该做什么吗？

我告诉你：如果你想要他救赎你，想要他爱你，想要他为你开路、带你到父那里去，你就必须听他。你必须聆听他，你必须让那坚实、不退让、客观的真理进入你的生命。你愿意吗？

因为他若不是这一切，就什么都不是；但既然他确实是这一切，他就向我们显明父神。他是神本体那完全、准确的表像，是神荣耀所发出的光辉。

让我们祷告。

父啊，我们感谢你，这一切都是为着我们。我们感谢你，因为耶稣基督来到世上并且为我们舍命，你就可以在看见我们罪恶的同时，仍然扑向我们的颈项，对我们说：“把袍子给他穿上，把戒指戴在他手上，把那只肥牛犊牵来宰了，我们可以吃喝欢乐，因为他是我的人，他已经回家了。”

父啊，当我们看见耶稣基督的时候，也唯有这样的时候，我们才真正看见你。只有他能将你启示出来，只有他做得到。我们为他独一无二、至高无上的启示向你感谢。

我们求你，使我们今晚能学会两件事：第一，我们要研读圣经，我们要研读你的话语，我们要把它熟知于心；第二，你的儿子耶稣基督是那至高、终极的先知，他的真理超越一切其他所谓真理，他向我们所呈现你的形象，是一切启示中最高、最完全的图画。

我们感谢你赐下这伟大的启示，也求你帮助我们把它内化在自己的生命里，并因此被改变。“除了子以外，没有人认识父；子愿意把父显明给谁，谁就能认识他。”我们奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。
