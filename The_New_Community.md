### Introduction: The Sermon on the Mount

Welcome to the Gospel and Life podcast. Today, Tim Keller is teaching on perhaps the most well-known sermon ever preached, the sermon on the Mount. In it, we'll find Jesus' invitation to a radical new kind of life that is far beyond a guide to morality. After you listen to today's teaching, we invite you to go online to gospelandlife.com and sign up for email updates. When you sign up, you'll receive our quarterly journal and other valuable gospel-centered resources. You can subscribe today at gospelandlife.com. Turn your bulletins to the passage from the sermon on the Mount. We'll look at tonight.

Now, the sermon on the Mount is not something that we should be reading as if it's an individual, a guide for an individual, a guide simply for how I, as an individual, should live my life. The sermon on the Mount is really a description of a new kind of community. That's the reason why John Stott, who's a great Bible commentator, very well-known, when he wrote his commentary on the sermon on the Mount, he called it the Christian counterculture. Because this is really describing a body of people, it's describing a community.

> "The sermon on the Mount is really a description of a new kind of community."

**But what's so interesting is that even though that theme, the theme of Christian community, Christian fellowship, of deep Christian relationships, even though that theme is all through the sermon on the Mount, there's no one section where Jesus sort of lays out how a relationship with him radically changes our relationships with other Christians.** How it forms a new, deep, radical human community in Christ. He doesn't actually lay it out in any one place. It's through everything else. So in order for me to do what I want to do tonight, which is to say what Jesus tells us about this new human community that his gospel creates between believers. In order to talk about that, I have to pull these pieces out. So let's read these pieces and string them along like a string of pearls on a string.

### The Necessity of Community

What does Jesus teach us about this radical new community that is formed by his gospel message when it comes into your life? How does it create this new community between those who believe in Jesus? Here's what he teaches us in this passage. Five things. Five things. It's a liberal arts major. Five things.

First of all, he teaches us the necessity of this new community. You can't be a Christian without entering a new community. The way he gets this across, this is something that you're over going to overlook unless you bring it out and look at it. What does he call other Christians? What do we call them? What are they? Over and over and over again, in verse 21 to 23, four times, five times, he says, brother. Do not murder. But I tell you, anyone who's angry with his brother, anyone who says it was brother. Anyone, therefore, if you're offering your gift at the altar and you remember your brother, then down in chapter 7, those verses. Why do you look at the spec of sawdust in your brother's eye? Hypocritic, the plank out of your eye, then you'll be able to clearly remove the spec from your brother's eye. Eight, seven, eight times.

Now, this is pretty obvious, but let me help you, let us sink in. The people that you automatically get related to when you're born into a family are not friends. You choose your friends, not lovers. You choose your lovers, relatives. You don't choose your relatives. And they're not, look at your relatives. These aren't people you would have chosen. Look at your siblings. Your brothers and sisters, they come automatically. You don't want to be an orphan. No, no. You'd like to have parents who wouldn't want to have parents. The trouble with getting parents. You don't want to be an orphan. You get parents. If you get parents, you automatically get family. You automatically get relatives. You automatically get brothers and sisters. And they're not like friends or lovers. Those are people you choose. Those are volunteer relationships. Family relationships are with people that you don't particularly like. And yet you just really know way to get away from them. They're there. And you have obligations. And you've got to see them. And you've got to deal with them. And you've got to deal with them.

> "You can't be a Christian without entering a new community."

**And Jesus has the audacity to use that terminology to describe other Christians to you.** Well, let's put it another way. When you enter into a relationship with the Father through Jesus. The whole point of Christianity is he is not a boss. You're not working for a boss. So as long as you're producing, you have a job. But if you stop producing, you're fired. He's a father. That means you have an enduring and unconditional and unmerited relationship. But what that means is, unlike your friends, you enter into a relationship with a friend, because, hey, I think I can get something out of this relationship. I like you. You like me. Let's do things together. We have common interests. That's friends. Or you fall in love. Wow. You're attracted to you. You're attracted to me. And so on. Those are actually conditional relationships. But family is unconditional. Jesus says, if you want an unconditional relationship with your Father, you're going to get unconditional relationships with brothers and sisters. You're going to have people around you. Christians who now are family. And you have got to treat them as family. You have an obligation to them. It's not a voluntary relationship. I know. I'm putting this in the most negative possible way. Why not? Because it's part of what it means. Basically, you can turn them into friends. You ought to try. In fact, we're going to spend the rest of the time talking about how you do. You want to turn your brothers and sisters into friends. In some cases, you would like to marry a brother or sister, hopefully. You would like to turn at least one of them into a lover and into a spouse. But the fact is, they all start out there at least brothers and sisters. And that means you have got an unconditional relationship with them. They're yours. Whether you like them or not. And in many, many cases, in fact, in most cases, you won't. You won't like them. Just like you don't like your own relatives so many of them. And that's what Jesus is saying.

### The Intensity of Community

In C.S. Lewis's Narnia Chronicles, there's a place when Aslan the Great Lion, who's the Christ figure, he's been resurrected. Or it's just like Jesus. And then he bends down to his two girls, Susan and Lucy. And he says, and now, said Aslan, to business, we have a long journey and you must ride on me. And he crashed down and the children climbed onto his warm golden back and Susan sat first holding on tightly to his main and Lucy sat behind holding tightly to Susan. And with a great heavey rose underneath them and shot off faster than any horse can go.

Now, this is very interesting. If you read the story and if you know, and some of you do, not most of you, but some of you do, if you know something about the characters, it's very interesting how the author, C.S. Lewis, depicted the post-resurrection church and their relationship to the Lord. Because that's what he's showing. Susan, of all the children in the book, Susan is the weak one. She's the spiritually weak one. She's obtuse. She's cruel to Lucy. She never gets it. She's kind of stupid, spiritually speaking. But Lucy is the true heart. Lucy is the dear heart. Lucy is the one with the deepest spiritual sight. Lucy is the one with the best relationship with Aslan. But C.S. Lewis puts Lucy up on Aslan's back and the only way she can hold on to Aslan is to hold on to Susan. And this is exactly what the Bible says. If you want to have a relationship with Jesus, if you want to be related to him in mission, Aslan says, we've got places to go. I've got things to do. You've got to hold on to me. But the only way he will let you hold on to him is if you're willing to hold on to Susan, to brothers and sisters that you don't like.

> "The only way he will let you hold on to him is if you're willing to hold on to Susan, to brothers and sisters that you don't like."

**Lucy, when you read the book, if you do read the book, you identify with her. And you say, if anybody deserves to be able to get on Aslan's back and be an individual practicing mystic, it would be her. She gets up there, she holds on to the main, personal contact. I don't need anybody else. And you see, typically Americans today say, I want to be spiritual, but I don't want to be religious. And what they usually mean by that is I want to have a personal experience of divine reality, but I don't want to have to deal with other people. I don't want to have to join an institution. I don't want to have to be part of a body. And the God of the Bible says, I don't work like that. You're going to have to make up another God. The only way you can hold on to me is if you hold on to Susan, to hold on to brothers, to hold on to sisters, people that you wouldn't really have chosen to be friends. But because they are related to me, now you have to be related to them. You have to hold on to them. You have to love them. You have to know them. And the question, can I get personal with you? You've got, there are people around you who are Christians, your brothers and sisters. And you're making, you know, they're not your friends, but they are your brothers and sisters. Are you putting up with them? Are you dealing with them? Are you trying to turn them into friends? Now, that's the first thing Jesus talks about, the necessity of a new community. He doesn't work in your life as an individual. He only works in your life corporately. Secondly, he not only talks about the necessity of Christian community, he talks about the intensity. See, clearly you're supposed to have deep relationships. Okay, somebody says, how deep? How deep do they have to go? Well, he tells us in verse 23. He tells us how intense. Therefore, if you're offering your gift at the altar and remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar, first go and be reconciled to your brother, then come and offer your gift.

Now, there are two standards in his, in his little verse. Jesus is telling us here just how deeply involved you've got to be with other Christians. You have to be involved to the place of personal accountability and corporate spirituality. Personal accountability, corporate spirituality. What do we mean? Well, first of all, personal accountability. Look, therefore, if you're offering your gift at the altar and you remember your brother has something against you, leave, go, get reconciled. Now, this is really weird. Listen carefully. It doesn't say if you've got something against your brother. It doesn't even say if you've done something against your brother. See, look carefully. This person, whoever this is, this brother, has a grievance against you, but you don't have a grievance against him. Now, if that person has a grievance against you, shouldn't he come to you? Yes. He hasn't. Why not? Now, if this person's got a grievance against you and he hasn't come to you, that means either he's a coward or it means he's over-sensitive and he's really making things up and he's too upset and he's overly resentful. In other words, this guy is at fault. If this was a voluntary relationship, there'd be no reason for you to go to that. I mean, it's up to him. If he's got a problem with me, I should come to me, okay. Jesus holds you responsible inside the family of God that whether that person is worthy of it, whether that person's being stupid or smart, whether you've actually done something wrong or not, you are responsible to go. Why? You're accountable. You're accountable for that person's spiritual growth and that person's accountable for yours. The Bible says that that's the difference. That's the difference. Friendship is an informal, voluntary kind of mutual relationship but your brothers and sisters, family, you are accountable to each other. In Hebrews chapter 3, verse 13, it says, exhort one another daily, lest you're hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. Now that's very interesting. Hardened. The Bible says, sin is like frigid air and your heart is like a bucket of water. If you are going camping in the winter, you know that you've got to always be breaking the ice on the top of the bucket of water because it just forms there naturally. And if you don't keep breaking it, next thing you know you'll turn around and you'll be looking for something to drink or to cook with and it will be frozen solid. Now the Bible says that your heart is like that. That it's automatically getting proud or it's getting either hard through pride or hard through sadness. If things are going well in your life, it's getting hard through proudness. Poorly in your life, it's getting hard through sadness, but it's going hard. It's always getting hard. Naturally, it's as water on a cold day. And what does the Hebrews 3, 13 say? Is the only way you're going to avoid freezing. And the answer is you've got to have some people in your life who know you well enough to be able to talk to you about your pride and talk to you about your sadness and talk to you about your problems and talk to you about your character flaws. And not only do you have to have people who know you're that open with, you've also got to have people that you have that much contact with. This is one of the issues, a big issue. If you're a Christian and you live in this day and age, you're a mobile. You're a mobile and your friends are a mobileist. Especially if you live in New York. You're always saying goodbye to friends. And you know what that means? And they're saying goodbye to you and they're moving around. You know what that means? That means you do have people in the world that you're open enough with for them to be breaking the ice over your heart. But usually you don't have anybody nearby. I mean, it takes tremendous work to be constantly getting open enough with the people who know you, the people who really live near you and the people that you are seeing enough so that they can hold you accountable. But you've got to be deeply involved enough so that there's personal accountability between you and other people. Who does know about you? Who have you given the green light to blow the whistle on you? Who are you opening up? Fairly regularly about everything. About your prayer life. About how you use your money. About your sex life. About your thought life. About your... Who? If you have nobody... Jesus holds... Jesus says, I insist you have people that you're that accountable for and that you're that accountable too who are always breaking the ice over your heart. Who are they? Do you have them? So first of all, he's saying you've got to have relationships that are deep to the place of personal accountability. Superficial fellowship. Saying hi to everybody, hugging and kissing at church is not enough. Secondly, you also, he's showing us here, you have to also have deep relationships to the point not just of personal accountability but of corporate spirituality, what do I mean? Well, look at the verse again. What's the problem? You need to go get your brother and bring him to the altar. Your brother's not there. See, the issue is, don't worship alone. You must not worship alone. Now, this simply doesn't mean... It doesn't mean, well, I want to go to a big church where there's 1500 people there and that's more spiritual than a small church. That's not what we're talking about. Here's what we're talking about. The Bible says, in this place, that only as a temple, you know, it says in 1 Peter and also in Ephesians 2, it says, as a temple, we are living stones in a temple, inhabited by the Spirit of God. You know that image? Well, that's not just a beautiful image. It's beautiful. We are stones were built together, we're cemented in together, and the Lord inhabits us. It's only together that we're inhabited. C.S. Lewis says in his book, The Four Loves. By the way, I'm using all C.S. Lewis illustrations tonight. Anybody notice? C.S. Lewis says that when he was a circle, he was a member of a circle of three people, three friends. Jack, Ronald, he's Jack. Jack, Ronald, and Charles. And when Charles died, he thought he'd have more of Ronald. But what he said, and I'll read it. To his shock, he found he had less of Ronald. That's what he says. He says in each of my friends, there's something that only some other friend can fully bring out. By myself, I am not large enough to call the whole person into activity. By myself, I am not large enough to call the whole person into activity. Now that Charles is dead, I'll never see Ronald's reaction to his humor. Far from having more of Ronald, now that Charles is gone, I have less.

### The Symmetry of Community

Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer? Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith? For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding of what it means to follow Christ. A great resource to start using this summer is the new city-catechism devotional, God's truth for our hearts and minds. This devotional brings the historic catechisms of the Christian Church to life, offering a question to consider for each week of the year. In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catechesis, the rich and communal practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers that frame the foundational beliefs of the Christian faith. Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer, and a brief meditation that will challenge and inspire you. The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller, and Kevin D. Young, as well as historical figures such as Augustine, John Calvin, and Martin Luther. This month, in addition to the new city-catechism devotional, we are including a great companion resource, the new city-catechism for kids, as our thank you for your gift to help gospel and life share the hope of Christ's love with people all over the world. So, request your copies today at gospelonlife.com slash give. That's gospelonlife.com slash give.

Now, here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching.

Now, why did Louis bring that up? If that's true of a human being, if it's true that you really can't know somebody. Now, you know this, by the way, when you're married to somebody, you think you know them. One-on-one. And in a way, you do. You know them better than anybody else. But you still all, one-on-one. One of the things that is kind of interesting is very often you think you know your spouse pretty well. And a new person comes into your life. A new friend, a new somebody. And that new person brings something out in your spouse that you've never seen before. Even if you've been with her for 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, amazing. Why? Here's the principle. As an individual, you are insufficient to draw the entire person into activity. You cannot bring it all out. It's only in a group that you can know an individual well. And if that's true of human beings, what about God Himself? It means that if you know two or three Christians, really, in a middle, you're not going to know God very well. If you know more Christians, the more Christians know in a middle, the more of God you're going to know because they see a part of God that only they see. They bring out something in God that only they can bring out. And as a result, unless you're praying with people, unless you're worshiping with people, unless you've got people that you can talk to about your Christianity, talk to about your feelings about God, talk to about what your struggles and wrestling with God. If you don't have people you're wrestling and praying and praising God with, you don't really know Him very well. Jesus says, go get your brother. I don't want you to be at the altar by yourself. Go get your sister. I don't want you at the altar by yourself. That's the necessity of this new community and that's the intensity. This new community.

### The Causality of Community

Thirdly, we're told about the symmetry of this new community. Now, here's what I think. Symmetry, you say, yeah. How do you get these relationships this deep? How do you get them down that deep? And Jesus says the key is treating people with a balance. And it's a balance of truth and love, basically. But look at the way He puts it. It's down here at the bottom, chapter 7. Do not judge or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you'll be judged. Okay, now that's interesting. Don't be judgmental, right? Don't condemn. That sounds great. But then look down to verse 6. Do not give dogs what is sacred. Do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet and turn interior pieces. Well, verse 1. In verse 1, He's saying, don't condemn people. Don't be judgmental. In verse 6, He's calling people pigs and dogs. And now, you know what? If you think that's a contradiction, you don't understand the balance. And almost nobody does. I mean, I don't. And really nobody but Jesus had this. Over and over and over again over the Bible says, love without truth. If you just say, oh, I don't want to tell anybody with the truth. I don't want to tell anybody that they're wrong. I don't want to confront. I don't want to challenge. Who am I to say they're wrong? If you have relationships like that, we're always saying, who am I to say they're wrong? That's love without truth and that's not really love. You say, I don't want to be judgmental. But you never are willing to say this person's being a pig. This person's being a dog. This person's being stupid. This person's being spiritually obtuse. If you never are willing to challenge, if you love without truth, it's not really love. It's idolatry. It's self-indulgence. It's cowardice. Because you're not giving them what they need. If you love them without truth, you're not really loving them. You're not really loving them. You're loving yourself. You coward. You're loving yourself. You don't want that person to ever go away. You're too dependent on them. And therefore, if you're too dependent on them, you're not really loving them. You're loving yourself through them. You're using them. But on the other hand, on the other hand, truth without love, condemning people, writing them off, holding them to standards and then saying, you're not living up to standards. Truth without love is not really truth. You know why? Because it tells people that God's not about grace. Truth without love is actually a falsehood. Verse 6 has been used over the years, quite people this way. People have read verse 6 and they say, well, clearly the pearls and the holy things, the sacred things, are the things of God, the truth, the gospel, the things of the kingdom. And clearly what this is saying is, don't give people that which they can't appreciate. Don't give to people who don't believe the gospel. Don't tell them about it. Don't give to people who can't appreciate it and who are unworthy of it. Don't take the truth to them. They'll just trample it under feet. Have you ever heard it preached that way? Have you ever heard it discussed that way? Actually, I have to admit that in the long ago, I found a sermon that I preached on this in 1977, hopefully that I can, which I said that. I said, this verse means that you must not take the truth to people who can't appreciate it. There's a small problem with that. I was reading a book by Dallas Willard called the Divine Conspiracy, which is a new book and it's a meditation on the sermon on the mount. And he says, if this means that you shouldn't give truth to people who can't appreciate it, then why in the world did Jesus ever come? I mean, you know, Jesus, if you say, this is, don't give the truth to people who can't appreciate it and aren't worthy of it. Well, Jesus could have saved himself a trip then. I mean, there's nobody down here who appreciates it. There's nobody down here who's worthy of it. And by the way, it almost, if that's the way you understand verse six, then Jesus didn't take his own advice because he came down. He told people about the truth who didn't appreciate it and they didn't turn upon him and they tore him to pieces. However, that's not what it's saying. Dallas Willard does a very good job in which he says, it's not saying pigs and dogs are not people who can't appreciate the truth. They're people who can't digest the truth. When it says, throw, what do you throw to pigs? You throw them food. And what he's saying is, he says, and I think he's absolutely right, he says, when you give people the truth in such a way, here's a pig, very, very hungry, and you're throwing pearls. And the pig bites down and it hurts. And it swallows and chokes. Eventually he says, Dallas Willard says, the pigs are going to turn on you. Why? Because at least you're edible. And what he means is this is saying, love without truth is not love, but truth without love. Truth where you take the truth and you push it on people, you force it on people or you demand that they get it or understand it or journey through it or process it the way you did. In the one of C.S. Lewis's non-eachronicals called the horse and his boy, there's two characters, one is named Shasta and one is named Aravus. Shasta's a boy Aravus is the girl. One point they're traveling along and a lion appears and with his huge claws he scratches Aravus across the back and it hurts and it draws blood but then he disappears. Later in the book, Shasta meets Aslan, the lion, and Aslan is the Christ figure. And Shasta says, are you the lion that's scratched and wounded Aravus? And Aslan says, yes I am. Just Shasta says, why in the world did you do that? You're this great king, you're this good person, you know, you're this great and glorious savior. Why did you do that? And this is what he says. He turns to him and says, child, he says, I'm telling you your story, not hers. I tell no one any story but his own. Now C.S. Lewis got that right out of the Bible, right out of the end of the book of John, where St. Peter asked about John the Apostle, says, Lord, what's going to happen to him? And Jesus says, I don't tell anybody their other story. I only tell you your story. Now what does that mean? This is the reason why Christians don't keep this balance. I'm afraid. Christian, you've got to speak the truth. You've got to confront people but you must be very, very careful. You only know your own story. You don't completely know anybody else's story. You don't know what they deserve. You don't know what God's doing in their life completely. You cannot see their whole journey. You must not prescribe your experiences if it has to be their experience. You must not push otherwise you're turning them into pigs. I mean, the idea behind the verse is really that you deserve to be eaten and they will turn on you and they will bite you because you're saying it's got to be done this way and it's got to be done in this order and you've got to accept this. No, no, no, no, no. Love without truth is not really love but truth of that love is not really truth. There needs to be humility before the greatness of the soul in front of you, humility before the greatness of Christ being formed in that person. Unless you've got that, if you don't see the greatness of what God's doing in the life of another Christian, if you don't realize it's there, you're either going to love and not tell the truth. But Jesus says, no, if that person is something's wrong, verse 23, go to him, reconcile with him, figure it out. Go, go, don't you dare be silent. Don't you dare, can't be a coward. But on the other hand, don't you dare think you know exactly what that person has to do and how that person has to jump through the hoops. Oh no, there has to be a symmetry, a balance in your life between truth and love. Now somebody's, I know what somebody's saying. Somebody's saying, well, how do I know if I'm unbalanced in my attitude toward other people in my other Christian? How do I know if my relationships are unbalanced? Oh, assume it. Assume that you're on, you are. In our temperament, our natural temperament without the Holy Spirit, you're either going to be a truth type or a love type. You're either going to be a nice person, diplomatic and sweet, but basically a coward, or you're going to be a challenge, fourth right, direct person, but basically cruel, basically unfeeling. We're going to be one of the other. And the only way to get that symmetry so that your relationships get down into the depths unto personal accountability and corporate spirituality is if you read about Jesus and how he treated people, read it over and over and over and over and over again.

Now, lastly, that's the necessity, that's the intensity, that's the symmetry, but what's the causality? What is it that actually causes these kinds of relationships? Now, it's really pretty subtle, but let me just suggest when Jesus says judge not, don't be judgmental or you'll be judged. You know what the word judge is here? It's the word condemn. It's not the word evaluate. He's not saying evaluate not. You have to evaluate. Otherwise, you can't tell the truth. Otherwise, you can't know what somebody needs. He says, don't condemn, but the word condemn is the same word as in Romans 8 verse 1. Now, there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. If you know that Jesus Christ was judged, if you know Jesus Christ took the condemnation, all of it, that creates an energy in you so that the judgmentalism is just drained right out of you. And that brings these symmetry. And only that brings the symmetry.

Let me close this way. Let me be real practical. Let me say something to three kinds of people. If you're not sure you're a Christian, you're not sure what you believe, if you're kind of in spiritual process, get a friend, a good friend who is a Christian that you respect, you'll never, ever, probably, it's very rare, I should say, not ever, ever. It is very unlikely you're going to process the gospel and the information about Jesus Christ on your own. God doesn't work that way. He works through people. Isn't that good? You know, don't say, oh my word, that's good. Isn't that the big problem in the world? Go, if you read the gospel narrative, you'll see John the Baptist tells Andrew about Jesus. And he meets Jesus. Andrew tells Philip about Jesus. And he meets Jesus. Philip goes and tells Nathaniel about Jesus. And he meets Jesus. None of these people get there on their own. If you're trying to figure out where you are spiritually and what you believe, and you're trying to do it all by yourself reading books coming to Redeemer, I don't care if you're inspired by the music or the sermons. I don't care. You're going to get bored or you're going to get confused unless you got a friend to process it with.

Secondly, Christian friends, how do you get personal accountability and corporate spirituality by coming to a worship service? By coming to worship service every single week? By volunteering or something? Even? No, only in a small group. Either a small group you put together or a small group that you go to that's already made. Unless you have a small group of Christians who are praying together and holding each other accountable, you cannot obey what Jesus Christ calls you to.

Lastly, one more CSList reference. There's six tonight. Lewis wrote a book called Mayor Christianity some years ago. Actually, it was a series of radio talks. It's basically about, he says, I'm not going to talk about Greek orthodoxy or Roman Catholicism or Presbyterianism or Baptist. I'm going to talk about general mayor Christianity. A lot of people love that because isn't that what we want? Instead of getting into denominations and differences, don't we just want to be Christians? Of course we do. And yet, he wrote a major warning at the beginning of his book. And he said this, he says, I hope no reader will think Mayor Christianity has put forth here as an alternative to existing churches. As if you could adopt Christianity in preference to congregationalism or Presbyterianism or Anglicanism or Greek orthodoxy. What I'm writing is more like a hall out of which doors open into several rooms. If I can bring anyone into the hallway, I shall have done what I attempted, but it is in the rooms not in the hall where there are fires and chairs and meals. Now hear this, because I know this is true of a lot of people. We want to be Mayor Christians. We hate the scandal of particularity. What Lewis is saying is we all want to just be Christians in general. But if you're actually, he says, Christianity itself, this idea of Christianity is an abstraction. If you really want meals, if you really want fires, if you really want chairs, if you really want rest, if you really want growth, you've got to get into a real church, you've got to get into a church where people are accountable to each other. You've got to get into a church where there's covenants, where there's accountability. And that means it's going to be a particular kind of church. It's going to be a Baptist church or it's going to be a Presbyterian church. Even it's going to be an Anglican church or agree with the words of our church. Now I know you've got church to say, we're not denominational. Well, that's congregationalism. I mean, that's the denomination of churches that insist they're not a denomination. There's always been there. You're never going to be able to actually grow in grace unless you get into a real church and that church is going to have positions you don't like. I don't like the way they baptize. I don't like this or that about the way they do this. The scandal of particularity, you're never going to find a church that's just right. But a lot of you are still in the hallway. You stay in the hallway. You flip around. You go from church to church or you go to no church. You're a mere Christian, but see as Lewis says, it's only in the rooms. It's only in the real particular churches with all their warts and all their specifics and all their particularities that there's meals and fire and chairs. That's the reason why you're not growing. You've got to get involved in something. You've got to put your feet down in a particular church. See, Jesus Christ says, you're in a family admitted. That's pray.

We thank you, Father, for granting to us a family. Oh, we want family until we actually get it. We want brothers and sisters. It sounds so wonderful until we actually see them. Brothers and sisters are not ones that we've chosen. They're not friends. They're not lovers. They're brothers and sisters. And, Lord, there's a lot of people in our lives around us that we're not taking seriously as brothers and sisters. We pray that you would help us to admit and accept our brothers and sisters and turn them more and more into friends and fellow worshipers. People that we know and love and hold tight to because we know the more we hold tight to them, the more we'll hold tight to your son. It's in his name that we pray. Amen.

### Introduction: The Sermon on the Mount

Welcome to the Gospel and Life podcast. Today, Tim Keller is teaching on perhaps the most well-known sermon ever preached, the sermon on the Mount. In it, we'll find Jesus' invitation to a radical new kind of life that is far beyond a guide to morality. After you listen to today's teaching, we invite you to go online to gospelandlife.com and sign up for email updates. When you sign up, you'll receive our quarterly journal and other valuable gospel-centered resources. You can subscribe today at gospelandlife.com. Turn your bulletins to the passage from the sermon on the Mount. We'll look at tonight.

Now, the sermon on the Mount is not something that we should be reading as if it's an individual, a guide for an individual, a guide simply for how I, as an individual, should live my life. The sermon on the Mount is really a description of a new kind of community. That's the reason why John Stott, who's a great Bible commentator, very well-known, when he wrote his commentary on the sermon on the Mount, he called it the Christian counterculture. Because this is really describing a body of people, it's describing a community.

> "The sermon on the Mount is really a description of a new kind of community."

**But what's so interesting is that even though that theme, the theme of Christian community, Christian fellowship, of deep Christian relationships, even though that theme is all through the sermon on the Mount, there's no one section where Jesus sort of lays out how a relationship with him radically changes our relationships with other Christians.** How it forms a new, deep, radical human community in Christ. He doesn't actually lay it out in any one place. It's through everything else. So in order for me to do what I want to do tonight, which is to say what Jesus tells us about this new human community that his gospel creates between believers. In order to talk about that, I have to pull these pieces out. So let's read these pieces and string them along like a string of pearls on a string.

### The Necessity of Community

What does Jesus teach us about this radical new community that is formed by his gospel message when it comes into your life? How does it create this new community between those who believe in Jesus? Here's what he teaches us in this passage. Five things. Five things. It's a liberal arts major. Five things.

First of all, he teaches us the necessity of this new community. You can't be a Christian without entering a new community. The way he gets this across, this is something that you're over going to overlook unless you bring it out and look at it. What does he call other Christians? What do we call them? What are they? Over and over and over again, in verse 21 to 23, four times, five times, he says, brother. Do not murder. But I tell you, anyone who's angry with his brother, anyone who says it was brother. Anyone, therefore, if you're offering your gift at the altar and you remember your brother, then down in chapter 7, those verses. Why do you look at the spec of sawdust in your brother's eye? Hypocritic, the plank out of your eye, then you'll be able to clearly remove the spec from your brother's eye. Eight, seven, eight times.

Now, this is pretty obvious, but let me help you, let us sink in. The people that you automatically get related to when you're born into a family are not friends. You choose your friends, not lovers. You choose your lovers, relatives. You don't choose your relatives. And they're not, look at your relatives. These aren't people you would have chosen. Look at your siblings. Your brothers and sisters, they come automatically. You don't want to be an orphan. No, no. You'd like to have parents who wouldn't want to have parents. The trouble with getting parents. You don't want to be an orphan. You get parents. If you get parents, you automatically get family. You automatically get relatives. You automatically get brothers and sisters. And they're not like friends or lovers. Those are people you choose. Those are volunteer relationships. Family relationships are with people that you don't particularly like. And yet you just really know way to get away from them. They're there. And you have obligations. And you've got to see them. And you've got to deal with them. And you've got to deal with them.

> "You can't be a Christian without entering a new community."

**And Jesus has the audacity to use that terminology to describe other Christians to you.** Well, let's put it another way. When you enter into a relationship with the Father through Jesus. The whole point of Christianity is he is not a boss. You're not working for a boss. So as long as you're producing, you have a job. But if you stop producing, you're fired. He's a father. That means you have an enduring and unconditional and unmerited relationship. But what that means is, unlike your friends, you enter into a relationship with a friend, because, hey, I think I can get something out of this relationship. I like you. You like me. Let's do things together. We have common interests. That's friends. Or you fall in love. Wow. You're attracted to you. You're attracted to me. And so on. Those are actually conditional relationships. But family is unconditional. Jesus says, if you want an unconditional relationship with your Father, you're going to get unconditional relationships with brothers and sisters. You're going to have people around you. Christians who now are family. And you have got to treat them as family. You have an obligation to them. It's not a voluntary relationship. I know. I'm putting this in the most negative possible way. Why not? Because it's part of what it means. Basically, you can turn them into friends. You ought to try. In fact, we're going to spend the rest of the time talking about how you do. You want to turn your brothers and sisters into friends. In some cases, you would like to marry a brother or sister, hopefully. You would like to turn at least one of them into a lover and into a spouse. But the fact is, they all start out there at least brothers and sisters. And that means you have got an unconditional relationship with them. They're yours. Whether you like them or not. And in many, many cases, in fact, in most cases, you won't. You won't like them. Just like you don't like your own relatives so many of them. And that's what Jesus is saying.

### The Intensity of Community

In C.S. Lewis's Narnia Chronicles, there's a place when Aslan the Great Lion, who's the Christ figure, he's been resurrected. Or it's just like Jesus. And then he bends down to his two girls, Susan and Lucy. And he says, and now, said Aslan, to business, we have a long journey and you must ride on me. And he crashed down and the children climbed onto his warm golden back and Susan sat first holding on tightly to his main and Lucy sat behind holding tightly to Susan. And with a great heavey rose underneath them and shot off faster than any horse can go.

Now, this is very interesting. If you read the story and if you know, and some of you do, not most of you, but some of you do, if you know something about the characters, it's very interesting how the author, C.S. Lewis, depicted the post-resurrection church and their relationship to the Lord. Because that's what he's showing. Susan, of all the children in the book, Susan is the weak one. She's the spiritually weak one. She's obtuse. She's cruel to Lucy. She never gets it. She's kind of stupid, spiritually speaking. But Lucy is the true heart. Lucy is the dear heart. Lucy is the one with the deepest spiritual sight. Lucy is the one with the best relationship with Aslan. But C.S. Lewis puts Lucy up on Aslan's back and the only way she can hold on to Aslan is to hold on to Susan. And this is exactly what the Bible says. If you want to have a relationship with Jesus, if you want to be related to him in mission, Aslan says, we've got places to go. I've got things to do. You've got to hold on to me. But the only way he will let you hold on to him is if you're willing to hold on to Susan, to brothers and sisters that you don't like.

> "The only way he will let you hold on to him is if you're willing to hold on to Susan, to brothers and sisters that you don't like."

**Lucy, when you read the book, if you do read the book, you identify with her. And you say, if anybody deserves to be able to get on Aslan's back and be an individual practicing mystic, it would be her. She gets up there, she holds on to the main, personal contact. I don't need anybody else. And you see, typically Americans today say, I want to be spiritual, but I don't want to be religious. And what they usually mean by that is I want to have a personal experience of divine reality, but I don't want to have to deal with other people. I don't want to have to join an institution. I don't want to have to be part of a body. And the God of the Bible says, I don't work like that. You're going to have to make up another God. The only way you can hold on to me is if you hold on to Susan, to hold on to brothers, to hold on to sisters, people that you wouldn't really have chosen to be friends. But because they are related to me, now you have to be related to them. You have to hold on to them. You have to love them. You have to know them. And the question, can I get personal with you? You've got, there are people around you who are Christians, your brothers and sisters. And you're making, you know, they're not your friends, but they are your brothers and sisters. Are you putting up with them? Are you dealing with them? Are you trying to turn them into friends? Now, that's the first thing Jesus talks about, the necessity of a new community. He doesn't work in your life as an individual. He only works in your life corporately. Secondly, he not only talks about the necessity of Christian community, he talks about the intensity. See, clearly you're supposed to have deep relationships. Okay, somebody says, how deep? How deep do they have to go? Well, he tells us in verse 23. He tells us how intense. Therefore, if you're offering your gift at the altar and remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar, first go and be reconciled to your brother, then come and offer your gift.

Now, there are two standards in his, in his little verse. Jesus is telling us here just how deeply involved you've got to be with other Christians. You have to be involved to the place of personal accountability and corporate spirituality. Personal accountability, corporate spirituality. What do we mean? Well, first of all, personal accountability. Look, therefore, if you're offering your gift at the altar and you remember your brother has something against you, leave, go, get reconciled. Now, this is really weird. Listen carefully. It doesn't say if you've got something against your brother. It doesn't even say if you've done something against your brother. See, look carefully. This person, whoever this is, this brother, has a grievance against you, but you don't have a grievance against him. Now, if that person has a grievance against you, shouldn't he come to you? Yes. He hasn't. Why not? Now, if this person's got a grievance against you and he hasn't come to you, that means either he's a coward or it means he's over-sensitive and he's really making things up and he's too upset and he's overly resentful. In other words, this guy is at fault. If this was a voluntary relationship, there'd be no reason for you to go to that. I mean, it's up to him. If he's got a problem with me, I should come to me, okay. Jesus holds you responsible inside the family of God that whether that person is worthy of it, whether that person's being stupid or smart, whether you've actually done something wrong or not, you are responsible to go. Why? You're accountable. You're accountable for that person's spiritual growth and that person's accountable for yours. The Bible says that that's the difference. That's the difference. Friendship is an informal, voluntary kind of mutual relationship but your brothers and sisters, family, you are accountable to each other. In Hebrews chapter 3, verse 13, it says, exhort one another daily, lest you're hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. Now that's very interesting. Hardened. The Bible says, sin is like frigid air and your heart is like a bucket of water. If you are going camping in the winter, you know that you've got to always be breaking the ice on the top of the bucket of water because it just forms there naturally. And if you don't keep breaking it, next thing you know you'll turn around and you'll be looking for something to drink or to cook with and it will be frozen solid. Now the Bible says that your heart is like that. That it's automatically getting proud or it's getting either hard through pride or hard through sadness. If things are going well in your life, it's getting hard through proudness. Poorly in your life, it's getting hard through sadness, but it's going hard. It's always getting hard. Naturally, it's as water on a cold day. And what does the Hebrews 3, 13 say? Is the only way you're going to avoid freezing. And the answer is you've got to have some people in your life who know you well enough to be able to talk to you about your pride and talk to you about your sadness and talk to you about your problems and talk to you about your character flaws. And not only do you have to have people who know you're that open with, you've also got to have people that you have that much contact with. This is one of the issues, a big issue. If you're a Christian and you live in this day and age, you're a mobile. You're a mobile and your friends are a mobileist. Especially if you live in New York. You're always saying goodbye to friends. And you know what that means? And they're saying goodbye to you and they're moving around. You know what that means? That means you do have people in the world that you're open enough with for them to be breaking the ice over your heart. But usually you don't have anybody nearby. I mean, it takes tremendous work to be constantly getting open enough with the people who know you, the people who really live near you and the people that you are seeing enough so that they can hold you accountable. But you've got to be deeply involved enough so that there's personal accountability between you and other people. Who does know about you? Who have you given the green light to blow the whistle on you? Who are you opening up? Fairly regularly about everything. About your prayer life. About how you use your money. About your sex life. About your thought life. About your... Who? If you have nobody... Jesus holds... Jesus says, I insist you have people that you're that accountable for and that you're that accountable too who are always breaking the ice over your heart. Who are they? Do you have them? So first of all, he's saying you've got to have relationships that are deep to the place of personal accountability. Superficial fellowship. Saying hi to everybody, hugging and kissing at church is not enough. Secondly, you also, he's showing us here, you have to also have deep relationships to the point not just of personal accountability but of corporate spirituality, what do I mean? Well, look at the verse again. What's the problem? You need to go get your brother and bring him to the altar. Your brother's not there. See, the issue is, don't worship alone. You must not worship alone. Now, this simply doesn't mean... It doesn't mean, well, I want to go to a big church where there's 1500 people there and that's more spiritual than a small church. That's not what we're talking about. Here's what we're talking about. The Bible says, in this place, that only as a temple, you know, it says in 1 Peter and also in Ephesians 2, it says, as a temple, we are living stones in a temple, inhabited by the Spirit of God. You know that image? Well, that's not just a beautiful image. It's beautiful. We are stones were built together, we're cemented in together, and the Lord inhabits us. It's only together that we're inhabited. C.S. Lewis says in his book, The Four Loves. By the way, I'm using all C.S. Lewis illustrations tonight. Anybody notice? C.S. Lewis says that when he was a circle, he was a member of a circle of three people, three friends. Jack, Ronald, he's Jack. Jack, Ronald, and Charles. And when Charles died, he thought he'd have more of Ronald. But what he said, and I'll read it. To his shock, he found he had less of Ronald. That's what he says. He says in each of my friends, there's something that only some other friend can fully bring out. By myself, I am not large enough to call the whole person into activity. By myself, I am not large enough to call the whole person into activity. Now that Charles is dead, I'll never see Ronald's reaction to his humor. Far from having more of Ronald, now that Charles is gone, I have less.

### The Symmetry of Community

Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer? Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith? For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding of what it means to follow Christ. A great resource to start using this summer is the new city-catechism devotional, God's truth for our hearts and minds. This devotional brings the historic catechisms of the Christian Church to life, offering a question to consider for each week of the year. In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catechesis, the rich and communal practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers that frame the foundational beliefs of the Christian faith. Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer, and a brief meditation that will challenge and inspire you. The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller, and Kevin D. Young, as well as historical figures such as Augustine, John Calvin, and Martin Luther. This month, in addition to the new city-catechism devotional, we are including a great companion resource, the new city-catechism for kids, as our thank you for your gift to help gospel and life share the hope of Christ's love with people all over the world. So, request your copies today at gospelonlife.com slash give. That's gospelonlife.com slash give.

Now, here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching.

Now, why did Louis bring that up? If that's true of a human being, if it's true that you really can't know somebody. Now, you know this, by the way, when you're married to somebody, you think you know them. One-on-one. And in a way, you do. You know them better than anybody else. But you still all, one-on-one. One of the things that is kind of interesting is very often you think you know your spouse pretty well. And a new person comes into your life. A new friend, a new somebody. And that new person brings something out in your spouse that you've never seen before. Even if you've been with her for 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, amazing. Why? Here's the principle. As an individual, you are insufficient to draw the entire person into activity. You cannot bring it all out. It's only in a group that you can know an individual well. And if that's true of human beings, what about God Himself? It means that if you know two or three Christians, really, in a middle, you're not going to know God very well. If you know more Christians, the more Christians know in a middle, the more of God you're going to know because they see a part of God that only they see. They bring out something in God that only they can bring out. And as a result, unless you're praying with people, unless you're worshiping with people, unless you've got people that you can talk to about your Christianity, talk to about your feelings about God, talk to about what your struggles and wrestling with God. If you don't have people you're wrestling and praying and praising God with, you don't really know Him very well. Jesus says, go get your brother. I don't want you to be at the altar by yourself. Go get your sister. I don't want you at the altar by yourself. That's the necessity of this new community and that's the intensity. This new community.

### The Causality of Community

Thirdly, we're told about the symmetry of this new community. Now, here's what I think. Symmetry, you say, yeah. How do you get these relationships this deep? How do you get them down that deep? And Jesus says the key is treating people with a balance. And it's a balance of truth and love, basically. But look at the way He puts it. It's down here at the bottom, chapter 7. Do not judge or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you'll be judged. Okay, now that's interesting. Don't be judgmental, right? Don't condemn. That sounds great. But then look down to verse 6. Do not give dogs what is sacred. Do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet and turn interior pieces. Well, verse 1. In verse 1, He's saying, don't condemn people. Don't be judgmental. In verse 6, He's calling people pigs and dogs. And now, you know what? If you think that's a contradiction, you don't understand the balance. And almost nobody does. I mean, I don't. And really nobody but Jesus had this. Over and over and over again over the Bible says, love without truth. If you just say, oh, I don't want to tell anybody with the truth. I don't want to tell anybody that they're wrong. I don't want to confront. I don't want to challenge. Who am I to say they're wrong? If you have relationships like that, we're always saying, who am I to say they're wrong? That's love without truth and that's not really love. You say, I don't want to be judgmental. But you never are willing to say this person's being a pig. This person's being a dog. This person's being stupid. This person's being spiritually obtuse. If you never are willing to challenge, if you love without truth, it's not really love. It's idolatry. It's self-indulgence. It's cowardice. Because you're not giving them what they need. If you love them without truth, you're not really loving them. You're not really loving them. You're loving yourself. You coward. You're loving yourself. You don't want that person to ever go away. You're too dependent on them. And therefore, if you're too dependent on them, you're not really loving them. You're loving yourself through them. You're using them. But on the other hand, on the other hand, truth without love, condemning people, writing them off, holding them to standards and then saying, you're not living up to standards. Truth without love is not really truth. You know why? Because it tells people that God's not about grace. Truth without love is actually a falsehood. Verse 6 has been used over the years, quite people this way. People have read verse 6 and they say, well, clearly the pearls and the holy things, the sacred things, are the things of God, the truth, the gospel, the things of the kingdom. And clearly what this is saying is, don't give people that which they can't appreciate. Don't give to people who don't believe the gospel. Don't tell them about it. Don't give to people who can't appreciate it and who are unworthy of it. Don't take the truth to them. They'll just trample it under feet. Have you ever heard it preached that way? Have you ever heard it discussed that way? Actually, I have to admit that in the long ago, I found a sermon that I preached on this in 1977, hopefully that I can, which I said that. I said, this verse means that you must not take the truth to people who can't appreciate it. There's a small problem with that. I was reading a book by Dallas Willard called the Divine Conspiracy, which is a new book and it's a meditation on the sermon on the mount. And he says, if this means that you shouldn't give truth to people who can't appreciate it, then why in the world did Jesus ever come? I mean, you know, Jesus, if you say, this is, don't give the truth to people who can't appreciate it and aren't worthy of it. Well, Jesus could have saved himself a trip then. I mean, there's nobody down here who appreciates it. There's nobody down here who's worthy of it. And by the way, it almost, if that's the way you understand verse six, then Jesus didn't take his own advice because he came down. He told people about the truth who didn't appreciate it and they didn't turn upon him and they tore him to pieces. However, that's not what it's saying. Dallas Willard does a very good job in which he says, it's not saying pigs and dogs are not people who can't appreciate the truth. They're people who can't digest the truth. When it says, throw, what do you throw to pigs? You throw them food. And what he's saying is, he says, and I think he's absolutely right, he says, when you give people the truth in such a way, here's a pig, very, very hungry, and you're throwing pearls. And the pig bites down and it hurts. And it swallows and chokes. Eventually he says, Dallas Willard says, the pigs are going to turn on you. Why? Because at least you're edible. And what he means is this is saying, love without truth is not love, but truth without love. Truth where you take the truth and you push it on people, you force it on people or you demand that they get it or understand it or journey through it or process it the way you did. In the one of C.S. Lewis's non-eachronicals called the horse and his boy, there's two characters, one is named Shasta and one is named Aravus. Shasta's a boy Aravus is the girl. One point they're traveling along and a lion appears and with his huge claws he scratches Aravus across the back and it hurts and it draws blood but then he disappears. Later in the book, Shasta meets Aslan, the lion, and Aslan is the Christ figure. And Shasta says, are you the lion that's scratched and wounded Aravus? And Aslan says, yes I am. Just Shasta says, why in the world did you do that? You're this great king, you're this good person, you know, you're this great and glorious savior. Why did you do that? And this is what he says. He turns to him and says, child, he says, I'm telling you your story, not hers. I tell no one any story but his own. Now C.S. Lewis got that right out of the Bible, right out of the end of the book of John, where St. Peter asked about John the Apostle, says, Lord, what's going to happen to him? And Jesus says, I don't tell anybody their other story. I only tell you your story. Now what does that mean? This is the reason why Christians don't keep this balance. I'm afraid. Christian, you've got to speak the truth. You've got to confront people but you must be very, very careful. You only know your own story. You don't completely know anybody else's story. You don't know what they deserve. You don't know what God's doing in their life completely. You cannot see their whole journey. You must not prescribe your experiences if it has to be their experience. You must not push otherwise you're turning them into pigs. I mean, the idea behind the verse is really that you deserve to be eaten and they will turn on you and they will bite you because you're saying it's got to be done this way and it's got to be done in this order and you've got to accept this. No, no, no, no, no. Love without truth is not really love but truth of that love is not really truth. There needs to be humility before the greatness of the soul in front of you, humility before the greatness of Christ being formed in that person. Unless you've got that, if you don't see the greatness of what God's doing in the life of another Christian, if you don't realize it's there, you're either going to love and not tell the truth. But Jesus says, no, if that person is something's wrong, verse 23, go to him, reconcile with him, figure it out. Go, go, don't you dare be silent. Don't you dare, can't be a coward. But on the other hand, don't you dare think you know exactly what that person has to do and how that person has to jump through the hoops. Oh no, there has to be a symmetry, a balance in your life between truth and love. Now somebody's, I know what somebody's saying. Somebody's saying, well, how do I know if I'm unbalanced in my attitude toward other people in my other Christian? How do I know if my relationships are unbalanced? Oh, assume it. Assume that you're on, you are. In our temperament, our natural temperament without the Holy Spirit, you're either going to be a truth type or a love type. You're either going to be a nice person, diplomatic and sweet, but basically a coward, or you're going to be a challenge, fourth right, direct person, but basically cruel, basically unfeeling. We're going to be one of the other. And the only way to get that symmetry so that your relationships get down into the depths unto personal accountability and corporate spirituality is if you read about Jesus and how he treated people, read it over and over and over and over and over again.

Now, lastly, that's the necessity, that's the intensity, that's the symmetry, but what's the causality? What is it that actually causes these kinds of relationships? Now, it's really pretty subtle, but let me just suggest when Jesus says judge not, don't be judgmental or you'll be judged. You know what the word judge is here? It's the word condemn. It's not the word evaluate. He's not saying evaluate not. You have to evaluate. Otherwise, you can't tell the truth. Otherwise, you can't know what somebody needs. He says, don't condemn, but the word condemn is the same word as in Romans 8 verse 1. Now, there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. If you know that Jesus Christ was judged, if you know Jesus Christ took the condemnation, all of it, that creates an energy in you so that the judgmentalism is just drained right out of you. And that brings these symmetry. And only that brings the symmetry.

Let me close this way. Let me be real practical. Let me say something to three kinds of people. If you're not sure you're a Christian, you're not sure what you believe, if you're kind of in spiritual process, get a friend, a good friend who is a Christian that you respect, you'll never, ever, probably, it's very rare, I should say, not ever, ever. It is very unlikely you're going to process the gospel and the information about Jesus Christ on your own. God doesn't work that way. He works through people. Isn't that good? You know, don't say, oh my word, that's good. Isn't that the big problem in the world? Go, if you read the gospel narrative, you'll see John the Baptist tells Andrew about Jesus. And he meets Jesus. Andrew tells Philip about Jesus. And he meets Jesus. Philip goes and tells Nathaniel about Jesus. And he meets Jesus. None of these people get there on their own. If you're trying to figure out where you are spiritually and what you believe, and you're trying to do it all by yourself reading books coming to Redeemer, I don't care if you're inspired by the music or the sermons. I don't care. You're going to get bored or you're going to get confused unless you got a friend to process it with.

Secondly, Christian friends, how do you get personal accountability and corporate spirituality by coming to a worship service? By coming to worship service every single week? By volunteering or something? Even? No, only in a small group. Either a small group you put together or a small group that you go to that's already made. Unless you have a small group of Christians who are praying together and holding each other accountable, you cannot obey what Jesus Christ calls you to.

Lastly, one more CSList reference. There's six tonight. Lewis wrote a book called Mayor Christianity some years ago. Actually, it was a series of radio talks. It's basically about, he says, I'm not going to talk about Greek orthodoxy or Roman Catholicism or Presbyterianism or Baptist. I'm going to talk about general mayor Christianity. A lot of people love that because isn't that what we want? Instead of getting into denominations and differences, don't we just want to be Christians? Of course we do. And yet, he wrote a major warning at the beginning of his book. And he said this, he says, I hope no reader will think Mayor Christianity has put forth here as an alternative to existing churches. As if you could adopt Christianity in preference to congregationalism or Presbyterianism or Anglicanism or Greek orthodoxy. What I'm writing is more like a hall out of which doors open into several rooms. If I can bring anyone into the hallway, I shall have done what I attempted, but it is in the rooms not in the hall where there are fires and chairs and meals. Now hear this, because I know this is true of a lot of people. We want to be Mayor Christians. We hate the scandal of particularity. What Lewis is saying is we all want to just be Christians in general. But if you're actually, he says, Christianity itself, this idea of Christianity is an abstraction. If you really want meals, if you really want fires, if you really want chairs, if you really want rest, if you really want growth, you've got to get into a real church, you've got to get into a church where people are accountable to each other. You've got to get into a church where there's covenants, where there's accountability. And that means it's going to be a particular kind of church. It's going to be a Baptist church or it's going to be a Presbyterian church. Even it's going to be an Anglican church or agree with the words of our church. Now I know you've got church to say, we're not denominational. Well, that's congregationalism. I mean, that's the denomination of churches that insist they're not a denomination. There's always been there. You're never going to be able to actually grow in grace unless you get into a real church and that church is going to have positions you don't like. I don't like the way they baptize. I don't like this or that about the way they do this. The scandal of particularity, you're never going to find a church that's just right. But a lot of you are still in the hallway. You stay in the hallway. You flip around. You go from church to church or you go to no church. You're a mere Christian, but see as Lewis says, it's only in the rooms. It's only in the real particular churches with all their warts and all their specifics and all their particularities that there's meals and fire and chairs. That's the reason why you're not growing. You've got to get involved in something. You've got to put your feet down in a particular church. See, Jesus Christ says, you're in a family admitted. That's pray.

We thank you, Father, for granting to us a family. Oh, we want family until we actually get it. We want brothers and sisters. It sounds so wonderful until we actually see them. Brothers and sisters are not ones that we've chosen. They're not friends. They're not lovers. They're brothers and sisters. And, Lord, there's a lot of people in our lives around us that we're not taking seriously as brothers and sisters. We pray that you would help us to admit and accept our brothers and sisters and turn them more and more into friends and fellow worshipers. People that we know and love and hold tight to because we know the more we hold tight to them, the more we'll hold tight to your son. It's in his name that we pray. Amen.

### 引言：登山宝训

欢迎来到福音与生活播客。今天，Tim Keller 将讲解可能是有史以来最著名的讲道——登山宝训。在其中，我们将发现耶稣对一种激进的新生活方式的邀请，这远远超出了道德指南。在您听完今天的讲道后，我们邀请您访问 gospelandlife.com 并注册电子邮件更新。当您注册时，您将收到我们的季度期刊和其他有价值的以福音为中心的资源。您可以今天在 gospelandlife.com 订阅。请翻开您的公告，找到今晚我们要看的登山宝训的经文。

现在，登山宝训不应该被我们当作个人指南来阅读，不仅仅是我作为一个个人应该如何生活的指南。登山宝训实际上是对一种新型社区的描述。这就是为什么伟大的圣经评论家约翰·斯托特在写他的登山宝训评论时，称其为基督教的反文化。因为这实际上是在描述一个群体，它是在描述一个社区。

> "登山宝训实际上是对一种新型社区的描述。"

**但有趣的是，即使这个主题——基督教社区、基督教团契、深刻的基督教关系的主题——贯穿整个登山宝训，耶稣却没有在任何一个地方详细说明与他的关系如何从根本上改变我们与其他基督徒的关系。** 它如何在基督里形成一个新的、深刻的、激进的人类社区。他实际上没有在任何一个地方详细说明。这贯穿于其他所有内容。因此，为了让我今晚做我想做的事情，也就是说明耶稣告诉我们关于他的福音在信徒之间创造的新的人类社区。为了谈论这一点，我必须将这些部分抽出来。所以让我们阅读这些部分，并像珍珠串一样将它们串在一起。

### 社区的必要性

耶稣教导我们关于他的福音信息进入你的生活时形成的这个激进的新社区的什么？它如何在那些相信耶稣的人之间创造这个新社区？这是他在这段经文中教导我们的五件事。五件事。它是一个文科专业。五件事。

首先，他教导我们这个新社区的必要性。你不能成为基督徒而不进入一个新社区。他通过这种方式传达这一点，这是你会忽略的东西，除非你把它拿出来看看。他称其他基督徒为什么？我们称他们为什么？他们是什么？在第 21 到 23 节中，一次又一次，四次，五次，他说，兄弟。不可杀人。但我告诉你，凡向弟兄动怒的，凡说弟兄的。凡是因此，如果你在祭坛上献礼物，记得你的弟兄，然后在第 7 章的那些经文中。为什么你看见你弟兄眼中的木屑，却不理会自己眼中的梁木？伪君子，先把自己眼中的梁木拿出来，然后你就能清楚地从你弟兄的眼中取出木屑。七、八次。

现在，这很明显，但让我帮助你，让我们沉浸其中。当你出生在一个家庭中时，你自动与之相关的人不是朋友。你选择你的朋友，不是爱人。你选择你的爱人，亲戚。你不选择你的亲戚。他们不是，看你的亲戚。这些不是你会选择的人。看看你的兄弟姐妹。你的兄弟姐妹，他们是自动来的。你不想成为孤儿。不，不。你想要有父母，谁不想要父母。得到父母的麻烦。你不想成为孤儿。你得到父母。如果你得到父母，你就自动得到家庭。你自动得到亲戚。你自动得到兄弟姐妹。他们不像朋友或爱人。那些是你选择的人。那些是志愿关系。家庭关系是与那些你不特别喜欢的人在一起。然而，你真的没有办法逃避他们。他们在那里。你有义务。你必须见他们。你必须处理他们。你必须处理他们。

> "你不能成为基督徒而不进入一个新社区。"

**耶稣有胆量用这种术语来描述其他基督徒给你。** 好吧，让我们换个说法。当你通过耶稣与父亲建立关系时。基督教的全部意义在于他不是老板。你不是为老板工作。所以只要你在生产，你就有工作。但如果你停止生产，你就被解雇了。他是父亲。这意味着你有一个持久的、无条件的、无功的关系。但这意味着，与朋友不同，你进入与朋友的关系，因为，嘿，我认为我可以从这种关系中得到一些东西。我喜欢你。你喜欢我。让我们一起做事。我们有共同的兴趣。这是朋友。或者你坠入爱河。哇。你被吸引到你。你被吸引到我。等等。这些实际上是有条件的关系。但家庭是无条件的。耶稣说，如果你想要与父亲建立无条件的关系，你会得到与兄弟姐妹的无条件关系。你会有周围的人。基督徒现在是家庭。你必须把他们当作家人。你对他们有义务。这不是志愿关系。我知道。我把这放在最消极的可能方式。为什么不呢？因为这是它的意义的一部分。基本上，你可以把他们变成朋友。你应该尝试。事实上，我们将花费剩下的时间讨论你如何做到这一点。你想把你的兄弟姐妹变成朋友。在某些情况下，你希望与兄弟或姐妹结婚，希望如此。你希望至少把他们中的一个变成爱人和配偶。但事实是，他们都至少是兄弟姐妹。这意味着你与他们有无条件的关系。他们是你的。不管你喜不喜欢他们。而且在很多很多情况下，事实上，在大多数情况下，你不会。你不会喜欢他们。就像你不喜欢你自己的亲戚那么多。这就是耶稣所说的。

### 社区的深度

在 C.S. 路易斯的《纳尼亚传奇》中，有一个地方，当伟大的狮子阿斯兰，他是基督的形象，他复活了。或者就像耶稣一样。然后他弯下腰对他的两个女孩，苏珊和露西说。然后他说，现在，阿斯兰说，开始工作了，我们有一段长途旅行，你必须骑在我身上。他蹲下来，孩子们爬上他温暖的金色背部，苏珊先坐着紧紧抓住他的鬃毛，露西坐在后面紧紧抓住苏珊。随着一声巨响，他在他们下面升起，比任何马都快。

现在，这非常有趣。如果你读过这个故事，如果你知道，有些人知道，大多数人不知道，但有些人知道，如果你对角色有所了解，作者 C.S. 路易斯如何描绘复活后的教会及其与主的关系非常有趣。因为这就是他在展示的。苏珊，在书中的所有孩子中，苏珊是最弱的。她是精神上最弱的。她迟钝。她对露西很残忍。她从来没有明白。她在精神上有点愚蠢。但露西是真正的心。露西是亲爱的心。露西是拥有最深刻精神视野的人。露西是与阿斯兰关系最好的人。但 C.S. 路易斯把露西放在阿斯兰的背上，她唯一能抓住阿斯兰的方法就是抓住苏珊。这正是圣经所说的。如果你想与耶稣建立关系，如果你想在使命中与他相关，阿斯兰说，我们有地方要去。我有事情要做。你必须抓住我。但他唯一会让你抓住他的方法是，如果你愿意抓住苏珊，抓住你不喜欢的兄弟姐妹。

> "他唯一会让你抓住他的方法是，如果你愿意抓住苏珊，抓住你不喜欢的兄弟姐妹。"

**露西，当你读这本书时，如果你读这本书，你会认同她。你会说，如果有人值得能够上阿斯兰的背，成为一个独立的神秘主义者，那就是她。她上去，她抓住鬃毛，个人接触。我不需要其他人。你看，典型的美国人今天说，我想要灵性，但我不想要宗教。他们通常的意思是我想要有神圣现实的个人体验，但我不想处理其他人。我不想加入一个机构。我不想成为一个身体的一部分。圣经的上帝说，我不是那样工作的。你将不得不创造另一个上帝。你唯一能抓住我的是如果你抓住苏珊，抓住兄弟，抓住姐妹，那些你不会真正选择成为朋友的人。但因为他们与我有关，现在你必须与他们有关。你必须抓住他们。你必须爱他们。你必须了解他们。问题是，我可以和你说说吗？你周围有基督徒，你的兄弟姐妹。你在做，你知道，他们不是你的朋友，但他们是你的兄弟姐妹。你在忍受他们吗？你在处理他们吗？你在努力把他们变成朋友吗？现在，这就是耶稣谈论的第一件事，新社区的必要性。他不会在你的生活中作为个人工作。他只会在你的生活中集体工作。其次，他不仅谈论基督教社区的必要性，他还谈论深度。显然，你应该有深刻的关系。好吧，有人说，多深？他们必须走多深？好吧，他在第 23 节告诉我们。他告诉我们有多激烈。因此，如果你在祭坛上献礼物，记得你的兄弟对你有意见，把你的礼物留在祭坛前，先去与兄弟和好，然后来献你的礼物。

现在，在他的这小节中有两个标准。耶稣在这里告诉我们，你必须与其他基督徒有多深的参与。你必须参与到个人责任和集体灵性的地步。个人责任，集体灵性。我们是什么意思？首先，个人责任。看，因此，如果你在祭坛上献礼物，记得你的兄弟对你有意见，离开，去，和好。现在，这真的很奇怪。仔细听。它没有说如果你对你的兄弟有意见。它甚至没有说如果你对你的兄弟做了什么。看，仔细看。这个人，无论是谁，这个兄弟，对你有怨言，但你对他没有怨言。现在，如果那个人对你有怨言，他不应该来找你吗？是的。他没有。为什么不呢？现在，如果这个人对你有怨言，他没有来找你，那意味着要么他是个懦夫，要么他过于敏感，他真的在编造事情，他太生气，他过于怨恨。换句话说，这个人有错。如果这是一个志愿关系，你没有理由去找那个人。我的意思是，这取决于他。如果他对我有问题，我应该来找我，好吧。耶稣在上帝的家庭中对你负责，无论那个人是否值得，无论那个人是愚蠢还是聪明，无论你是否真的做错了什么，你都有责任去。为什么？你有责任。你对那个人的灵性成长负责，那个人对你的负责。圣经说，这就是区别。这就是区别。友谊是一种非正式的、志愿的相互关系，但你的兄弟姐妹，家庭，你们对彼此负责。在希伯来书第 3 章第 13 节中，它说，每天彼此劝勉，免得你们被罪的诡诈所硬化。现在这很有趣。硬化。圣经说，罪就像寒冷的空气，你的心就像一桶水。如果你在冬天露营，你知道你必须一直打破水桶顶部的冰，因为它自然形成在那里。如果你不继续打破它，接下来你会转身，你会寻找喝的东西或做饭的东西，它会冻成固体。现在圣经说你的心就是这样。它自动变得骄傲，或者通过骄傲变得坚硬，或者通过悲伤变得坚硬。如果你的生活顺利，它通过骄傲变得坚硬。如果你的生活不顺利，它通过悲伤变得坚硬，但它变得坚硬。它总是变得坚硬。自然地，就像寒冷天气中的水。希伯来书 3 章 13 节说，唯一避免冻结的方法是什么？答案是你必须在你的生活中有一些人，他们足够了解你，能够与你谈论你的骄傲，与你谈论你的悲伤，与你谈论你的问题，与你谈论你的性格缺陷。而且你不仅要有那些了解你的人，你还必须有与你有那么多接触的人。这是一个问题，一个大问题。如果你是基督徒，你生活在这个时代，你是流动的。你是流动的，你的朋友是流动的。尤其是如果你住在纽约。你总是在和朋友说再见。你知道这意味着什么吗？他们在和你说再见，他们在四处走动。你知道这意味着什么吗？这意味着你在世界上确实有足够开放的人，他们可以打破你心上的冰。但通常你身边没有人。我的意思是，要不断地与了解你的人开放，与真正住在你附近的人开放，与那些你见得足够多的人开放，以便他们可以让你负责，这需要巨大的努力。但你必须足够深入地参与，以便在你和其他人之间有个人责任。谁了解你？你给谁开绿灯来吹哨子？你在定期开放什么？关于你的祷告生活。关于你如何使用你的钱。关于你的性生活。关于你的思想生活。关于你的...谁？如果你没有人...耶稣坚持...耶稣说，我坚持你有那些你负责的人，那些你负责的人，他们总是在打破你心上的冰。他们是谁？你有他们吗？所以首先，他说你必须有深刻到个人责任的关系。肤浅的团契。在教会里对每个人说嗨，拥抱和亲吻是不够的。其次，他在这里向我们展示，你还必须有深刻的关系，不仅仅是个人责任，还有集体灵性，我的意思是什么？好吧，再看看这节经文。问题是什么？你需要去找你的兄弟，把他带到祭坛上。你的兄弟不在那里。看，问题是，不要单独敬拜。你不能单独敬拜。现在，这并不意味着...这并不意味着，我想去一个有 1500 人的大教会，那比小教会更属灵。这不是我们在谈论的。我们在谈论的是什么？圣经在这个地方说，只有作为一个圣殿，你知道，它在彼得前书和以弗所书 2 章中说，作为一个圣殿，我们是圣殿中的活石，被上帝的灵所居住。你知道那个形象吗？好吧，那不仅仅是一个美丽的形象。它很美丽。我们是石头，我们被建在一起，我们被水泥粘在一起，主居住在我们中间。只有在一起我们才被居住。C.S. 路易斯在他的书《四种爱》中说。顺便说一句，今晚我用的都是 C.S. 路易斯的例子。有人注意到吗？C.S. 路易斯说，当他是一个圈子时，他是一个三个人的圈子的成员，三个朋友。杰克，罗纳德，他是杰克。杰克，罗纳德和查尔斯。当查尔斯去世时，他以为他会有更多的罗纳德。但他说的是什么，我会读出来。令他震惊的是，他发现他有更少的罗纳德。这就是他说的。他说在我的每个朋友中，只有其他朋友才能完全展现出来。单靠我自己，我不够大，无法将整个人唤醒。单靠我自己，我不够大，无法将整个人唤醒。现在查尔斯死了，我再也看不到罗纳德对他的幽默的反应。远非拥有更多的罗纳德，现在查尔斯走了，我拥有更少。

### 社区的对称性

你在寻找方法在这个夏天增长你的信仰吗？或者你希望帮助新信徒或孩子掌握基督教信仰的核心吗？对于我们中的许多人来说，夏季可以提供更多时间来加深我们的信仰和对跟随基督意味着什么的理解。一个很好的资源是新城市教理问答灵修，《上帝的真理为我们的心灵和思想》。这本灵修将基督教会的历史教理问答带入生活，每周提供一个问题供全年思考。在介绍中，Tim Keller 阐述了教理问答的理由，这是一种丰富的、共同的学习和记忆问题和答案的实践，构成了基督教信仰的基础信念。每周包括一段经文、一段祷告和一段简短的冥想，挑战和激励你。所包含的评论由当代牧师如 John Piper、Tim Keller 和 Kevin D. Young，以及历史人物如奥古斯丁、约翰·加尔文和马丁·路德撰写。本月，除了新城市教理问答灵修外，我们还包括一个很好的伴侣资源，新城市教理问答儿童版，作为我们感谢您帮助福音与生活分享基督之爱的礼物。因此，请今天在 gospelonlife.com/give 请求您的副本。那是 gospelonlife.com/give。

现在，这里是 Tim Keller 的今天讲道的其余部分。

现在，为什么路易斯提到这个？如果这对一个人来说是真的，如果这是真的，你真的无法了解某人。现在，顺便说一句，当你和某人结婚时，你认为你了解他们。一对一。在某种程度上，你确实如此。你比任何人都更了解他们。但你仍然一对一。有趣的是，通常你认为你非常了解你的配偶。然后一个新人进入你的生活。一个新朋友，一个新人。那个人在你的配偶中带出了一些你从未见过的东西。即使你和她在一起 10 年，15 年，20 年，令人惊讶。为什么？这是原则。作为个体，你不足以将整个人唤醒。你不能把它全部带出来。只有在一个群体中，你才能很好地了解一个人。如果这对人类来说是真的，那对上帝本身来说又如何呢？这意味着如果你真正了解两三个基督徒，你不会很了解上帝。如果你了解更多的基督徒，更多的基督徒了解中间，你会了解更多的上帝，因为他们看到的上帝的一部分只有他们看到。他们带出上帝的一些东西，只有他们能带出来。因此，除非你与人一起祷告，除非你与人一起敬拜，除非你有可以与你谈论你的基督教信仰的人，与你谈论你对上帝的感受的人，与你谈论你与上帝的挣扎和争斗的人。如果你没有与人一起争斗、祷告和赞美上帝的人，你就不会真正了解他。耶稣说，去找你的兄弟。我不想让你一个人在祭坛上。去找你的姐妹。我不想让你一个人在祭坛上。这是这个新社区的必要性和深度。这个新社区。

### 社区的因果关系

第三，我们被告知这个新社区的对称性。现在，这就是我认为的。对称性，你说，是的。你如何让这些关系如此深入？你如何让它们深入到那种程度？耶稣说关键是以平衡对待人。基本上是爱与真理的平衡。但看看他是如何表达的。就在这里，在第 7 章的底部。不要判断，否则你也会被判断。因为你如何判断别人，你也会被判断。好吧，这很有趣。不要评判，对吧？不要谴责。听起来不错。但然后看看第 6 节。不要把圣物给狗。不要把你的珍珠丢给猪。如果你这样做，他们可能会在他们的脚下践踏它们，然后转过来撕碎你。好吧，第 1 节。在第 1 节中，他说，不要谴责人。不要评判。在第 6 节中，他称人们为猪和狗。现在，你知道吗？如果你认为这是矛盾的，你就不明白平衡。几乎没有人理解。我不明白。实际上，除了耶稣之外，真的没有人有这个。一次又一次，圣经说，爱没有真理。如果你只是说，哦，我不想告诉任何人真相。我不想告诉任何人他们错了。我不想面对。我不想挑战。我是谁来判断他们错了？如果你有这样的关系，总是说，我是谁来判断他们错了？那是没有真理的爱，那不是真正的爱。你说，我不想评判。但你从来不愿意说这个人是猪。这个人是狗。这个人是愚蠢的。这个人是精神上迟钝的。如果你从来不愿意挑战，如果你没有真理的爱，那不是真正的爱。那是偶像崇拜。那是自我放纵。那是懦弱。因为你没有给他们他们需要的东西。如果你没有真理地爱他们，你不是真正爱他们。你不是真正爱他们。你在爱自己。你懦夫。你在爱自己。你不想让那个人离开。你太依赖他们了。因此，如果你太依赖他们，你不是真正爱他们。你通过他们爱自己。你在利用他们。但另一方面，另一方面，没有爱的真理，谴责人，写下他们，要求他们达到标准，然后说，你没有达到标准。没有爱的真理不是真正的真理。你知道为什么吗？因为它告诉人们上帝不是关于恩典的。没有爱的真理实际上是一个谎言。第 6 节多年来被人们这样使用。人们读第 6 节，他们说，显然珍珠和圣物，神圣的东西，是上帝的东西，真理，福音，王国的东西。显然，这就是说，不要给那些不能欣赏的人。不要给那些不相信福音的人。不要告诉他们。不要给那些不能欣赏它和不值得它的人。不要把真理带给他们。他们只会在脚下践踏它。你听过这样的讲道吗？你听过这样的讨论吗？实际上，我必须承认，在很久以前，我发现了一篇我在 1977 年讲的关于这个的讲道，希望我能，我说过。我说，这节经文意味着你不能把真理带给那些不能欣赏它的人。这个有个小问题。我在读一本由达拉斯·威拉德写的书，叫做《神圣阴谋》，这是一本新书，是对登山宝训的冥想。他说，如果这意味着你不应该把真理给那些不能欣赏它的人，那么耶稣为什么要来呢？我的意思是，你知道，耶稣，如果你说，这是，不要把真理给那些不能欣赏它和不值得它的人。好吧，耶稣可以省下自己的一次旅行。我的意思是，这里没有人欣赏它。这里没有人值得它。顺便说一句，如果这就是你理解第 6 节的方式，那么耶稣没有遵循自己的建议，因为他下来。他告诉人们关于真理，他们不欣赏它，他们没有转向他，他们撕碎了他。然而，这不是它所说的。达拉斯·威拉德做得很好，他说，这不是说猪和狗不是那些不能欣赏真理的人。他们是那些不能消化真理的人。当它说，扔，你扔给猪什么？你扔给他们食物。他说，他说，我认为他绝对正确，他说，当你以这样的方式给人们真理，这里有一只猪，非常非常饿，你在扔珍珠。猪咬下去，疼痛。它吞下去，窒息。最终他说，达拉斯·威拉德说，猪会转向你。为什么？因为至少你是可食用的。他的意思是这就是说，没有爱的真理不是爱，但没有爱的真理。真理，当你把真理推给人们，你强迫人们或你要求他们得到它或理解它或通过它或以你做的方式处理它。在 C.S. 路易斯的《纳尼亚传奇》之一中，叫做《马和他的男孩》，有两个角色，一个叫沙斯塔，一个叫阿拉维斯。沙斯塔是个男孩，阿拉维斯是个女孩。有一次他们在旅行，一只狮子出现，用他巨大的爪子划伤了阿拉维斯的背部，疼痛，流血，但然后他消失了。后来在书中，沙斯塔遇到了阿斯兰，狮子，阿斯兰是基督的形象。沙斯塔说，你是划伤和伤害阿拉维斯的狮子吗？阿斯兰说，是的，我是。沙斯塔说，为什么你要这样做？你是这个伟大的国王，你是这个好人，你知道，你是这个伟大而光荣的救主。你为什么要这样做？这就是他说的。他转向他说，孩子，他说，我在告诉你你的故事，不是她的。我不告诉任何人他们的故事。我只告诉你你的故事。现在 C.S. 路易斯直接从圣经中得到了这一点，直接从约翰福音的结尾得到了这一点，圣彼得问约翰使徒，主，这将发生在他身上吗？耶稣说，我不告诉任何人他们的故事。我只告诉你你的故事。现在这是什么意思？这就是为什么基督徒不保持这种平衡。我害怕。基督徒，你必须说出真相。你必须面对人，但你必须非常非常小心。你只知道你自己的故事。你完全不知道别人的故事。你不知道他们应得的。你不知道上帝在他们的生活中完全在做什么。你不能看到他们的整个旅程。你不能规定你的经历必须是他们的经历。你不能推，否则你会把他们变成猪。我的意思是，这节经文背后的想法实际上是你应该被吃掉，他们会转向你，他们会咬你，因为你说必须这样做，必须按这个顺序做，你必须接受这个。不，不，不，不，没有爱的真理不是真正的爱，但没有爱的真理不是真正的真理。你必须在你面前的灵魂的伟大面前谦卑，在基督在那个人中形成的伟大面前谦卑。除非你有这个，如果你没有看到上帝在另一个基督徒生活中所做的伟大，如果你没有意识到它在那里，你要么会爱而不说出真相。但耶稣说，不，如果那个人有问题，第 23 节，去找他，与他和解，弄清楚。去，去，不要沉默。你不能是懦夫。但另一方面，你不能认为你确切知道那个人必须做什么，那个人必须如何跳过箍。哦，不，你的生活中必须有对称性，真理和爱的平衡。现在有人，我知道有人在说。有人在说，好吧，我怎么知道我对其他人的态度是否不平衡，我对其他基督徒的态度是否不平衡？我怎么知道我的关系是否不平衡？哦，假设它。假设你在，你是。在我们的气质中，我们的自然气质没有圣灵，你要么是一个真理类型，要么是一个爱类型。你要么是一个好人，外交和甜美，但基本上是一个懦夫，或者你是一个挑战，直率，直接的人，但基本上是残酷的，基本上是无情的。我们将是其中之一。唯一能获得这种对称性的方法是让你的关系深入到个人责任和集体灵性的深度，是如果你阅读关于耶稣和他如何对待人的书，反复阅读。

最后，这就是必要性，这就是深度，这就是对称性，但因果关系是什么？是什么真正导致这些关系的？现在，这真的很微妙，但让我建议，当耶稣说不要评判，不要评判，否则你会被评判。你知道这里的评判这个词是什么吗？是谴责这个词。不是评估这个词。他不是说不评估。你必须评估。否则，你不能说出真相。否则，你不能知道某人需要什么。他说，不要谴责，但谴责这个词与罗马书第 8 章第 1 节中的词相同。现在，对于那些在基督耶稣里的人来说，没有谴责。如果你知道耶稣基督被评判，如果你知道耶稣基督承担了所有的谴责，那会在你里面产生一种能量，以至于评判主义被完全排干。只有这样才能带来这种对称性。

让我这样结束。让我说得更实际一点。让我对三种人说点什么。如果你不确定你是基督徒，你不确定你相信什么，如果你处于精神过程中的某个阶段，找一个朋友，一个你尊重的基督徒朋友，你永远不会，可能，很少，我应该说，不是永远，永远。你很可能不会自己处理福音和关于耶稣基督的信息。上帝不是那样工作的。他通过人工作。这不是很好吗？你知道，不要说，哦，我的天哪，那很好。这不是世界上的大问题吗？去，如果你读福音叙述，你会看到施洗约翰告诉安德鲁关于耶稣。他遇见了耶稣。安德鲁告诉腓力关于耶稣。他遇见了耶稣。腓力去告诉拿但业关于耶稣。他遇见了耶稣。这些人没有一个是自己到达的。如果你试图弄清楚你在精神上处于什么位置以及你相信什么，并且你试图自己通过阅读书籍来做到这一点，来到 Redeemer，我不在乎你是否被音乐或讲道激励。我不在乎。除非你有一个朋友与你一起处理，否则你会感到无聊或困惑。

其次，基督徒朋友，你如何通过参加礼拜服务获得个人责任和集体灵性？通过每周参加礼拜服务？通过志愿服务或其他事情？甚至？不，只有在一个小组中。要么是你自己组建的小组，要么是你去的已经组建的小组。除非你有一个小组的基督徒一起祷告并互相负责，否则你无法遵循耶稣基督对你的呼召。

最后，再引用一次 C.S. 路易斯。今晚有六次。路易斯多年前写了一本书，叫做《纯粹基督教》。实际上，这是一系列广播谈话。基本上，他说，我不会谈论希腊东正教或罗马天主教或长老会或浸信会。我将谈论一般的纯粹基督教。很多人喜欢这个，因为这不是我们想要的吗？而不是进入教派和差异，我们不只是想成为基督徒吗？当然我们想。然而，他在他的书的开头写了一个重要的警告。他说，我希望没有读者会认为这里提出的纯粹基督教是现有教会的替代品。好像你可以选择基督教而不是公理会或长老会或圣公会或希腊东正教。我写的更像是一个大厅，门打开几个房间。如果我能把任何人带进大厅，我就完成了我尝试的事情，但它是在房间里而不是在大厅里有火和椅子和饭菜。现在听这个，因为我知道这对很多人来说是真的。我们想成为纯粹的基督徒。我们讨厌特定性的丑闻。路易斯所说的是我们都想成为一般的基督徒。但如果你实际上，他说，基督教本身，这个基督教的想法是一个抽象。如果你真的想要饭菜，如果你真的想要火，如果你真的想要椅子，如果你真的想要休息，如果你真的想要成长，你必须进入一个真正的教会，你必须进入一个人们彼此负责的教会。你必须进入一个有契约的教会，有责任的教会。这意味着它将是一个特定类型的教会。它将是一个浸信会教会，或者它将是一个长老会教会。甚至它将是一个圣公会教会，或者同意我们教会的词语。现在我知道你有教会说，我们不是教派。好吧，那是公理会。我的意思是，那是坚持他们不是教派的教会的教派。一直都有。除非你进入一个真正的教会，否则你永远无法真正成长在恩典中，而那个教会将有你不喜欢的立场。我不喜欢他们洗礼的方式。我不喜欢他们这样做的方式的某些方面。特定性的丑闻，你永远找不到一个完全合适的教会。但你们中的很多人仍然在大厅里。你留在大厅里。你从一个教会跳到另一个教会，或者你不去教会。你是一个纯粹的基督徒，但正如路易斯所说，只有在房间里。只有在真正的特定教会中，所有的疣和所有的细节和所有的特定性中，才有饭菜和火和椅子。这就是为什么你没有成长的原因。你必须参与一些事情。你必须在一个特定的教会中扎根。看，耶稣基督说，你在一个家庭中承认。那是祈祷。

我们感谢你，父亲，赐给我们一个家庭。哦，我们想要家庭，直到我们真正得到它。我们想要兄弟姐妹。听起来很美好，直到我们真正看到他们。兄弟姐妹不是我们选择的人。他们不是朋友。他们不是爱人。他们是兄弟姐妹。主，我们生活中有很多人，我们没有认真对待他们作为兄弟姐妹。我们祈求你帮助我们承认和接受我们的兄弟姐妹，并将他们更多地变成朋友和共同崇拜者。我们认识和爱的人，并紧紧抓住，因为我们知道我们越紧紧抓住他们，我们就越紧紧抓住你的儿子。我们奉他的名祈祷。阿门。
