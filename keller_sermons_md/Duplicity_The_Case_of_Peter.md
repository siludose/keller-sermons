### Introduction

Recently, there was an inner church meeting of Christian men in the city called Promise Keepers. I got a chance to speak at it. The most unflattering way to explain that movement is to try to make Christian men make and keep more promises, make and keep more commitments. It was interesting that at that time, I was already preparing a sermon on the issue of integrity and Peter, and this incident here tells us, especially the case of Peter, tells us more about the power of commitments and the power of promise keeping than any other incident in the Scripture.

### Part 1: The Power of Promises

Peter was sitting out in the courtyard and a servant girl came to him. "You also were with Jesus of Galilee," she said, but he denied it before them all. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said. Then he went out to the gateway where another girl saw him and said to the people there, "This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth." He denied it again with an oath. "I don't know the man." After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, "Surely you are one of them. For your accent gives you away." Then he began to call down curses on himself and he swore to them, "I don't know the man." Immediately a rooster crowed and then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken. "Before the rooster crowed, you will disown me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly. This is God's word.

> "Without being bound to the fulfillment of our promises, we would never be able to keep an identity."

### Part 2: The Failure of Peter

Peter made a promise that 40 verses later he's breaking the promise. And we're told in verse 75, and this is what I want to look at in particular with you, he went out and wept bitterly. Not just he wept bitterly. Why? He was an absolutely broken man in the profoundest possible way. And yet within weeks, within weeks, he was poised as the leader of a new movement, the Christian movement that was about to change history, and he was about to become one of the most influential leaders in the history of the world.

### Part 3: Restoration through Promises

What broke him was he did not understand the power of promises. What restored him was he learned the secret. See, he didn't understand the power of promise breaking, but then he after that he learned the secret of promise keeping. And promises is the reason he was broken and promises is the reason he was restored.

### Part 4: The Role of Jesus' Promises

In John chapter 21, Jesus comes and restores Peter. And in that passage, he just does this. I can give you synopsis. He does something. First of all, he sits Peter down at a fire. And three times he says, "Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me?" Peter says, "Yes, I do." And then he asks him again, "Do you love me?" And he says, "Yes, I do." And a third time, three denials, three questions. "Do you love me?" And he says, "Yes, I do." And after each time, what does Jesus say? "I want you to be a leader of my sheep. I want you to feed and lead my flock just like before."

> "When a man makes an oath, Meg, he holds his own self in his hand like water. And if he opens his fingers, he needn't hope to find himself again."

### Conclusion

Jesus promised a judge. Jesus promised to die. And Jesus promised to forgive. We've got to have them all. I'm just going to tick them off. Number one, his promise to judge. Jesus Christ says, "Peter, I'm in charge. You live, you die, you die, you live. Don't you understand? I'm in charge. I am the judge of all the earth."

## 中文翻译

### 引言

最近，在城市里有一个基督徒男子的内部教会会议，叫做“承诺守护者”。我有机会在会上发言。最不客气的解释是试图让基督徒男子做出并保持更多的承诺，做出并保持更多的承诺。在那个时候，我已经在准备一篇关于诚信和彼得的讲道，这个事件尤其是彼得的案例，比圣经中的任何其他事件更能告诉我们关于承诺和承诺守护的力量。

### 第一部分：承诺的力量

彼得坐在院子里，一个使女走到他面前，说：“你也是和加利利的耶稣在一起的。”但他在众人面前否认了，说：“我不知道你在说什么。”然后他走到门口，另一个女孩看见他，对那里的人说：“这个人是和拿撒勒的耶稣在一起的。”他又发誓否认：“我不认识那个人。”过了一会儿，站在那里的人走到彼得面前说：“你肯定是他们中的一员，因为你的口音出卖了你。”然后他开始诅咒自己，并对他们发誓：“我不认识那个人。”立刻鸡叫了，然后彼得想起耶稣曾对他说的话：“鸡叫之前，你会三次不认我。”他走出去，痛哭流涕。这是上帝的话。

> “如果不受承诺履行的约束，我们将永远无法保持身份。”

### 第二部分：彼得的失败

彼得做出了一个承诺，但在40节之后他打破了这个承诺。我们在第75节被告知，这是我特别想和你们一起看的，他走出去，痛哭流涕。不仅仅是他痛哭流涕。为什么？他是一个在最深刻的意义上被彻底打破的人。然而在几周内，在几周内，他准备好成为一个新运动的领袖，这个基督教运动即将改变历史，他即将成为历史上最有影响力的领袖之一。

### 第三部分：通过承诺的恢复

打破他的是他没有理解承诺的力量。恢复他的是他学会了秘密。看，他没有理解打破承诺的力量，但之后他学会了承诺守护的秘密。承诺是他被打破的原因，承诺是他被恢复的原因。

### 第四部分：耶稣承诺的角色

在约翰福音第21章，耶稣来恢复彼得。在那段经文中，他这样做了。我可以给你一个概要。他做了一些事情。首先，他让彼得坐在火边。三次他说：“约拿的儿子西门，你爱我吗？”彼得说：“是的，我爱你。”然后他又问：“你爱我吗？”他说：“是的，我爱你。”第三次，三次否认，三次问题。“你爱我吗？”他说：“是的，我爱你。”每次之后，耶稣说什么？“我希望你成为我的羊的领袖。我希望你像以前一样喂养和领导我的羊群。”

> “当一个人发誓时，梅格，他把自己的自我握在手中，就像水一样。如果他张开手指，他就不必希望再次找到自己。”

### 结语

耶稣承诺审判。耶稣承诺死亡。耶稣承诺宽恕。我们必须拥有这一切。我只是要列出它们。第一，他承诺审判。耶稣基督说：“彼得，我掌管一切。你活着，你死去，你死去，你活着。你不明白吗？我掌管一切。我是全地的审判者。”
