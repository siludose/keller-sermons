### Introduction: Who is Jesus?

Who is Jesus? The Bible says He's fully God, the creator of the universe, and at the same time, fully human. Lose one of those and you lose Christianity. Join us for today's podcast where Tim Keller explores the person and promises of Jesus Christ. 2 Corinthians 10, 1-6.

> "By the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I appeal to you, I, Paul, who am timid when face to face with you, but bold went away."

**For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does.**

### Jesus as Prophet, Priest, and King

We've been talking about Jesus as prophet, priest, and king. There's a place in Matthew 12 where Jesus says, the men of Nineveh will stand up in judgment and condemn this generation. For they repented at the preaching of Jonah and behold a greater than Jonah is here.

> "And the queen of the south will rise up on the judgment day and condemn this generation for she came from the ends of the earth to Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon is here."

**That's quite a challenge, and that's quite a claim.**

### Jesus' Kingship in Our Hearts

Historically Christians and people who have studied the Bible have seen that Jesus Christ executes his office. That means he carries out his office of king in two different ways. He carries it out spiritually in the hearts of his people and he carries it out cosmically in history.

> "The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world in the contrary. They have divine power to demolish strongholds."

**Every thought has to be obedient to Christ.**

### Arguments and Pretensions

Implicitly, tacitly, in other words, it's unstated but completely assumed and therefore taught in the passage that Jesus Christ is king. And the reason we say Jesus Christ is king is because it says every thought has to be obedient to Christ.

- Arguments: Rational belief structures
- Pretensions: High things, proud things

### Conclusion: Capturing Every Thought

Paul says Jesus Christ will always come and show you your faith assumptions and show you that they're inferior. **He will always make you think.**

> "Take me to you imprison me for I accept you and throw me never shall be free nor ever chased unless you ravish me."

Let's pray to the king.

> "Our father we thank you that because you have come to us the way you have seeking to overthrow in order to win seeking to defeat us in order to lift us to victory."

**Help us to see what your design is for him or her.**

## 中文翻译

### 引言：耶稣是谁？

耶稣是谁？圣经说他是完全的神，是宇宙的创造者，同时也是完全的人。失去其中之一，你就失去了基督教。加入我们今天的播客，蒂姆·凯勒将探讨耶稣基督的人物和应许。哥林多后书 10:1-6。

> “我保罗，就是那在你们中间见面时是谦卑的，不在你们那里的时候向你们是勇敢的，借着基督的温柔和慈爱劝你们。”

**因为我们虽然在肉身中行事，却不凭着肉身争战。**

### 耶稣作为先知、祭司和君王

我们一直在谈论耶稣作为先知、祭司和君王。在马太福音12章中，耶稣说，尼尼微人要在审判的时候起来定这世代的罪，因为他们听了约拿所传的就悔改了，看哪，这里有一人比约拿更大。

> “南方的女王要在审判的时候起来定这世代的罪，因为她从地极而来，要听所罗门的智慧，看哪，这里有一人比所罗门更大。”

**这是一个很大的挑战，也是一个很大的宣称。**

### 耶稣在我们心中的王权

历史上，基督徒和研究圣经的人都看到耶稣基督执行他的职分。这意味着他以两种不同的方式履行他的王权。他在他子民的心中属灵地履行王权，并在历史上宇宙性地履行王权。

> “我们争战的兵器本不是属血气的，乃是在神面前有能力，可以攻破坚固的营垒。”

**每一个思想都必须顺服基督。**

### 论点和自负

隐含地，默示地，换句话说，虽然没有明说，但完全假定并因此在经文中教导耶稣基督是王。我们说耶稣基督是王的原因是因为它说每一个思想都必须顺服基督。

- 论点：理性的信仰结构
- 自负：高傲的事物

### 结论：俘获每一个思想

保罗说，耶稣基督总是会来向你展示你的信仰假设，并向你展示它们是低劣的。**他总是让你思考。**

> “带我到你那里囚禁我，因为我接受你，除非你征服我，否则我永远不会自由或纯洁。”

让我们向王祈祷。

> “我们的父，我们感谢你，因为你以这样的方式来到我们这里，寻求推翻以赢得胜利，寻求击败我们以提升我们到胜利。”

**帮助我们看到你对他或她的设计。**
