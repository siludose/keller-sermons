### Introduction: The Problem of Sin

You don't have to look far to see that something's deeply wrong with our world and with us. But is there an answer that gets to the root of why? In today's message, Tim Keller explores the human condition through stories in the Bible, uncovering what Scripture says about sin and why it's the only explanation deep enough to face the truth about ourselves.

> "We go to the next couple of weeks, four weeks actually. We're going to be looking at what Isaiah tells us about what's wrong with us."

**Isaiah has some pretty fascinating things to say because the longest, in some ways, the greatest Old Testament prophet.**

### The Messiah's Role

#### 1. The Prophecy

Isaiah 61, 1 to 11. The Spirit of the sovereign Lord is on me because the Lord has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the broken hearted to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all who mourn, and provide for those who grieve in Zion, to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair.

> "They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the Lord for the display of His splendor."

**They will rebuild the ancient ruins and restore the places long devastated.**

### The Impact of Sin

#### 1. Sin's Consequences

The wages of sin is ashes. You notice in verse three, it says, I will put a crown of beauty on where you have ashes. And he's thinking very literally, when somebody died or when anything went really wrong in your life, you didn't just put on black. What you did was you put ashes.

> "Life is like this. The Bible, what are ashes? You put something in the fire. And the fire knocks it apart."

**Sin disintegrates us. Sin makes us break down. Sin puts, sin is an invisible flame.**

### The Solution: The Messiah's Work

#### 1. The Messiah's Mission

The Messiah comes to deal with all the results of sin. The Messiah comes not look at Messiah does not come only to forgive your sins, give you peace in your in your little heart, and take you to heaven. The Messiah does not come to earth and say, let me take you away from all this.

> "Instead, he says I'm going to give you a joy and a power so we can rehab the world."

**My power, my spirit, my goal is not just simply to take you into some other world of esoteric consciousness.**

### Our Response

#### 1. Trust in the Messiah

Please trust him. Now, here's what I'm saying. The first thing is, look at verse 11, the soil is what grows the sapling. Do you see that? If I take an acorn and I hold it in my hand, I can walk around for years and years and years. You know what's going to happen? Nothing.

> "It's the soil that gives the power of growth to the acorn or at least opens up the power of growth in the acorn."

**It's the soil. It's the nutrients. It's the moisture.**

### 引言：罪的问题

你不需要走得太远就能看到我们的世界和我们自身存在着深刻的问题。但是否有一个答案可以深入探究其根源？在今天的信息中，Tim Keller 通过圣经中的故事探讨了人类的状况，揭示了圣经关于罪的说法，以及为什么它是唯一足够深刻的解释，可以面对关于我们自己的真相。

> "接下来的几周，实际上是四周，我们将会看看以赛亚告诉我们关于我们的问题。"

**以赛亚有一些非常有趣的事情要说，因为他是最长的，在某些方面是最伟大的旧约先知。**

### 弥赛亚的角色

#### 1. 预言

以赛亚书 61:1-11。主耶和华的灵在我身上，因为耶和华用膏膏我，叫我传好信息给谦卑的人，差遣我医好伤心的人，报告被掳的得释放，被囚的出监牢，报告耶和华的恩年和我们神报仇的日子，安慰一切悲哀的人，赐华冠与锡安悲哀的人，代替灰尘，喜乐油代替悲哀，赞美衣代替忧伤之灵。

> "他们必称为公义树，是耶和华所栽的，叫他得荣耀。"

**他们必修造久已荒废之处，建立历代荒凉之城。**

### 罪的影响

#### 1. 罪的后果

罪的工价就是灰烬。你注意到在第三节中，它说，我要在你有灰烬的地方放上美丽的冠冕。他非常字面地思考，当有人去世或生活中发生任何非常糟糕的事情时，你不仅仅是穿上黑色。你所做的是把灰烬放在头上。

> "生活就是这样。圣经，什么是灰烬？你把东西放进火里。火把它打散。"

**罪使我们分崩离析。罪使我们崩溃。罪是无形的火焰。**

### 解决方案：弥赛亚的工作

#### 1. 弥赛亚的使命

弥赛亚来是为了处理罪的所有结果。弥赛亚来不是仅仅为了赦免你的罪，给你内心的平安，并带你去天堂。弥赛亚不是来到地上说，让我带你离开这一切。

> "相反，他说我要给你一种喜乐和力量，以便我们可以重建世界。"

**我的力量，我的灵，我的目标不仅仅是简单地带你进入某个神秘意识的世界。**

### 我们的回应

#### 1. 信靠弥赛亚

请信靠他。现在，我要说的是，首先，看看第十一节，土壤是让小树苗生长的东西。你看到了吗？如果我拿着一个橡子，把它握在手里，我可以走来走去很多年。你知道会发生什么吗？什么都不会。

> "是土壤赋予橡子生长的力量，或者至少打开橡子生长的力量。"

**是土壤。是养分。是水分。**
