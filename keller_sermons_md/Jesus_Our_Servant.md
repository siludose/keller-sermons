### Introduction: Who is Jesus?

Who is Jesus? The Bible says He's fully God, the Creator of the universe, and at the same time, fully human. Lose one of those and you lose Christianity. Join us for today's podcast where Tim Keller explores the person and promises of Jesus Christ.

A reading from Psalm 69.

> Save me, O God, for the waters have come up to my neck. I sink in the myoree depths where there is no foothold. I have come into the deep waters, the floods engulf me. I am worn out calling for help. My throat is parched. My eyes fail looking for my God. Those who hate me without reason outnumber the hairs of my head. Many are my enemies without cause. Those who seek to destroy me. I am forced to restore what I did not steal. You know my folly, O God. My guilt is not hidden from you. May those who open you not be disgraced because of me, O Lord, the Lord Almighty. May those who seek you not be put to shame because of me, O God of Israel.

**For I endure scorn for your sake and shame covers my face.**

### Part 1: Jesus Came to Serve

#### 1. The Servant's Role

Jesus came to be a servant. You notice in verse 17, he says, why have you hidden your face from your servant? And in the very beginning of the paragraph, or the very beginning of the Psalm, he says, I sink. Save me, O Lord, for the waters have come up to my neck. I sink into my red depths where there is no foothold.

- **He came to sink.**
- He came to be a servant.

We read Philippians 2 earlier in the service. It's all about exactly what it means for Jesus to come as a servant and to sink.

### Part 2: Jesus Came to Be Hated

#### 1. Hated Without Cause

Jesus in the New Testament points out the fact that people automatically will hate him without reason. They'll hate him irrationally because he's holy.

> **There is something in the human heart that is afraid of real holiness.**

### Part 3: Jesus Came to Be Exchanged

#### 1. The Doctrine of Substitution

David is perplexed. He says, like I mentioned in verse 17, he says, How can you let your servant, how can you hide your face from your servant? I'm doing everything right, I'm being an exemplary servant, I'm loving you, I'm true to you.

> **Zeal for your house consumes me and the insults of those who insult you fall on me.**

Jesus says, That's what I came to do. But that which I did not deserve fell on me.

### Conclusion

Don't you see what's so wonderful about the teaching of the Bible? Jesus Christ did not come only as God's servant. No, he didn't come only as a model of what it means to serve God. If that's all he was, oh, we'd be in such trouble. We'd look at him and he'd be mad at him. We'd run from him. We'd hate him without cause. But instead, he sunk for me. And you, he sunk for us. He was hated for us. He was exchanged for us.

## 中文翻译

### 引言：耶稣是谁？

耶稣是谁？圣经说他是完全的神，宇宙的创造者，同时又是完全的人。失去其中一个，你就失去了基督教。加入我们今天的播客，蒂姆·凯勒将探讨耶稣基督的身份和应许。

诗篇 69 的阅读。

> 求你救我，神啊，因为众水要淹没我。我陷在深淤泥中，没有立脚之地。我到了深水中，大水漫过我。我因呼求困乏，喉咙发干，我的眼睛失明，等候我的神。无故恨我的，比我头发还多。无理与我为敌的，强盛要害我的人，逼我归还我没有抢夺的。神啊，我的愚昧，你原知道，我的罪愆不能隐瞒。

**因我为你的缘故受了辱骂，满面羞愧。**

### 第一部分：耶稣来是为了服侍

#### 1. 仆人的角色

耶稣来是为了成为仆人。你注意到在第 17 节，他说，为什么你隐藏你的脸不见你的仆人？在诗篇的开头，他说，我沉没。救我，主啊，因为众水要淹没我。我陷在深淤泥中，没有立脚之地。

- **他来是为了沉没。**
- 他来是为了成为仆人。

我们在礼拜中早些时候读了腓立比书 2 章。它完全讲述了耶稣作为仆人来并沉没的意义。

### 第二部分：耶稣来是为了被憎恨

#### 1. 无故被恨

耶稣在新约中指出，人们会无缘无故地恨他。他们会因为他的圣洁而非理性地憎恨他。

> **人心中有一种对真正圣洁的恐惧。**

### 第三部分：耶稣来是为了被交换

#### 1. 替代的教义

大卫感到困惑。他说，正如我在第 17 节提到的，他说，你怎么能让你的仆人，你怎么能隐藏你的脸不见你的仆人？我做的一切都对，我是一个模范仆人，我爱你，我对你忠诚。

> **因我为你的缘故受了辱骂，满面羞愧。**

耶稣说，这就是我来做的。但我不应得的落在了我身上。

### 结论

你难道不明白圣经教导的奇妙之处吗？耶稣基督不仅仅是作为神的仆人而来。他不仅仅是作为一个服侍神的榜样而来。如果他只是这样，我们会有很大的麻烦。我们会看着他，对他生气。我们会逃避他。我们会无故地恨他。但相反，他为我沉没。他为你沉没。他为我们被憎恨。他为我们被交换。
