. Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. Now, yes, listen, for those of you who have heard this illustration before, be patient,  but a lot of you haven't. It's my favorite and best illustration on this subject.

When I was in college, I took a music appreciation course, and I had to listen to a lot of Mozart  because they was on the test, and I had to be able to identify Mozart for the test. I listened to Mozart to get a passing grade in a class, so I get my degree, so I get out  and get a good job. I listened to Mozart, in other words, to make money. But today, my wife and I will spend a lot of money just to listen to Mozart.

What happened? Well, why do we listen to Mozart now? To get a good grade? No, I'm not in a class.

People will think I'm cultured, no, nobody sees me listen to Mozart. Well, why do you listen to Mozart? You know, you can say, I don't know, but what that means is, it's beautiful. It used to be that listening to Mozart was useful.

But now, it's beautiful, and beautiful means it's satisfying in and of itself. It's attractive. It fulfills in and of itself. It's not a means to an end.

You don't do it because it will get you something else. It's what you want. It's one of the things that gives you meaning in life. Now, here's what Edward said.

A person with a new heart stops obeying God just because he has to, or she has to, just  stops obeying God because it gets you somewhere else. But begins to aesthetically find God beautiful in and of who he is in himself, just to  be near him, just to delight him, just to please him. You see, people without a new heart obey God to get things, to get forgiveness, to get  blessing, to get heaven. They obey God to get things, but people with new hearts obey God just to get God, just  to get him, just to be near him, just to delight him.

And as a result, people with this new heart may actually have been in the church for years  and know all about various doctrines. But once you get the new heart, the doctrines start to live. That is to say, they were abstractions, but now they become realities. You see the love of God, and before you just knew about it, you taste the power of God,  but now before maybe you just believed in it.

In other words, things that were just sort of abstractions become incredibly galvanizing  and moving, and life changing, which brings me to the third point. Love, oh, the second point, pardon me, the second point. So the first sign of a changed heart, a circumcised heart, is that you love God for who  he is in and of himself, and you begin to sense who he is, as opposed to just believe  in a math straggly. But secondly, it changes your life.

It changes you. You see the whole point of this whole passage, the whole thrust is, because you have this  changed heart, now you obey, right? You don't obey to get the changed heart. The changed heart is not the result of obedience.

The obedience is the result of the changed heart. The changed heart comes as a gift of grace, and from the changed heart flows a life now  in conformity to the joyful unselfishness of the law of God. But you know what that means? If you really have a new heart, you get changed.

See, there are people who say, oh, I like what you just said about Jesus moving me. Well, I love it when I come to Redeemer. The songs move me. The preaching moves me.

Good. I love your servants. That's great. But John Edwards is not impressed, unless here's the really.

John Edwards says, I'm glad you like Tim Keller's servants. I'm glad. Maybe they make you weak. That's wonderful.

And you feel, oh, I really feel God's spiritual reality. Well, let's see. Do the people who know you best, the people around you who really see you, are they saying  you are becoming more and more unselfish, more and more generous, more and more kind,  more and more self-controlled, more and more courageous as the weeks go by? If you're not changing in the way you actually live, then you don't have that new heart.

You're just being stirred. Your emotions are being stirred. That's all. To have a new heart, you have a new sense of God's spiritual reality on you.

Secondly, you have a change life, but thirdly, you start growing. I love, you know, you'd almost miss it, unless you're looking for it. Carefully. Verse 6 says, the Lord your God will circumcise your hearts that you may love Him and  live, live.

What does that mean? Weren't they alive before? It's not talking about biological life, it's talking about spiritual life. And here's what's important.

Biological life comes gradually, so does spiritual life. So I'm sure some of you are a little worried from these first two points. You know, love God, meaning he becomes the ultimate beauty of your life and you start  to change and you start to say, well, I don't, hmm, hmm. You know, well, this might, this point may come for you.

Think of how biological life starts out. Look at babies. Look at them. They're basket cases.

They can't do a thing. They can't do a thing. Have you ever had a baby? I mean, they just take and take and they can't do anything.

You've got to take them everywhere. You've got to protect them from the cells all the time. I can't tell you how many times one of my kids were 18 months old. They were screaming and crying about something and I've said, I've only had good reason  with you, didn't help.

But think of how slow that works, well, spiritual life, look, in spite of the fact that the moment  your heart is circumcised, the moment you receive the new heart, there is a new love  implanted in you. It's a seed and it takes a long time to grow into a tree. Just takes time. You know, Paul says in Romans 7, I delight in the law of God in my inn most self.

Huh, that's a new, that's a circumcised heart. He says the thing I most want, the thing I most passionately love is I want to delight  him. And yet he says, I see all these other desires still in my life that vie with that and they  draw me away from doing what I should do in many cases. I'm improving, but you know, it's gradual, it's fits and starts, it takes time, yes.

But it's also organic, what I mean by organic is this. Real spiritual, a real new heart grows organically, not mechanically. Now for example, you can grow a pile of bricks, couldn't you? You could just put the, how do you grow a pile of bricks?

You just keep throwing bricks on it, it's growing, but it's growing through an external  action and it's growing only in quantity. But now how does a bulb grow into a tulip? That's growth too, but it's organic growth, not mechanical growth. It's growth from the inside, not the outside, and it's growth in quality, in complexity.

The organism is becoming more and more complex. It's not just growing in quantity and that real spiritual growth, the sign of a new heart  is you don't just grow mechanically, you don't just learn more Bible texts and learn  more doctrine and get more perfect attendance pins and rise up in the church and heap up  good deeds. You don't know, organically, you become wiser person as the years go by, deeper, happier  and sadder at the same time, more tender, hearted, more sensitive to other people at the same  time, happier yourself, more able to admit you're wrong, tougher and tender at the same  time, you grow in grace, you grow in spiritual life, you grow in spiritual character. Very different than just mechanical growth.

Do you have this heart? Do you have this heart? Maybe I should, this new heart, maybe I look, some of you say, well, have you been born  again? I'm asking you.

Some of you may be saying, well, that's for some people. There are born again Christians, sometimes they've had hard lives, it helps them. Jesus said to Nicodemus, pillar of the community, Bible teacher, you must be born again, period. And if Nicodemus need to be born again, he was so good and so great, anybody has to be  born again, and that's Jesus' point.

And you say, well, I don't know, you're talking about a dramatic kind of conversion experience  not necessarily. You know, when John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Church, describes his conversion  experience. He was at a meeting and they were reading the Bible or reading a book about the Bible. And he says, to describe his conversion experience, my heart was strangely warmed.

Now maybe that is dramatic for an Englishman, but put it another way. But you can have an experience like that and have no idea that that was the beginning  of your new heart. It might be weeks later, months later, years later you look back and say, that was the  beginning of the new spiritual awareness, that was the beginning, where I stopped just  knowing about God and began to be a spiritual reality. That's where all the changes started, sometimes it's not dramatic.

You don't know it right away, you have to look back and find it. But you must be born again, you must get your heart circumcised, you must get a new  heart. Do you have it? Do you see these things in yourself?

Well if you don't, how do you get it? And here's my suggestion to you. Don't say, God, give me a new heart. You know, I need a new heart, why?

Because I want to be a better person. It won't come that way. Here's what I want you to do. I want you to see how God procured a new heart.

How did God get a new heart for us? Look, we've been banished. We've been exiled. Go to Adam and Eve.

You say, well, that's the Jews, okay, Adam and Eve, that's all of us. Adam and Eve were put in the garden of Eden, paradise, and because they wanted to be their  own master, their own savers and Lord, they were banished, they were exiled. So we're all on the same boat. How could God possibly, in spite of all the curses that we deserve, just give us a new  heart?

How can he do it? The answer is in the right of circumcision. Let's go back and for a minute, think about circumcision. A lot of you are saying, I don't want to think about circumcision, okay.

Why is that the way the Israelites made their contract with God, you know, made their commitment  with God? Why? I mean, how about a tattoo? How about a, you know, cutting a lock of hair?

Why circumcision? You know, gross and bloody and vuh, that's the point. Yes, now you're getting the point. Because when Abraham made his covenant with God in Genesis 15, he walked between the torn  pieces of a dead animal.

Why? As he was making his promise, he walked through the pieces of the dead animal. Why? He was acting out the penalty for disobedience.

He was acting out the curse of the covenant by walking through the pieces. He was saying, I promise you my allegiance and Lord, if I don't do what I'm promising  today, may I be torn to pieces. That's what circumcision is. When the Israelites were circumcised, what they were saying is, we will obey you.

And if we are not obedient to you, may we be cut off? Because circumcision was an enactment, a dramatization of the curse of sin, the curse of  the covenant. What is the penalty for sin? When you lie, it cuts you off from other people.

When you cheat, when you're cruel, it isolates you. You can even see it there. The punishment of sin, the curse for sin is banishment. It's exile.

It's being cut off. Cut off from people. Cut off from your country. Cut off from God.

Circumcision represents the thing that we ought to experience. Circumcision. How did God give us a new heart on the cross? Centuries later, on an afternoon that turned into a dark and stormy night, Jesus was cut.

A spear thorns in his brow, spear in his side, nails in his hands, he was being cut. And when he said, my God, my God, why has thou forsaken me? What was happening? He wasn't just being physically cut.

It says right here in Isaiah 53, what happened to him? He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities, the punishment  that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed for he was cut off  from the land of the living. And now and only now, because you just sat through 30 minutes of this sermon, you will  have any idea what that strange passage in Colossians 2, 11 and 12 means. Because when Colossians 2, 11 and 12 says, Christians, you have been circumcised in the  circumcision of Christ on the cross.

And you were baptized in the baptism of Christ on the cross. And you read that and you say, what? But now maybe you understand. On the cross, Jesus Christ was experiencing the cosmic cutting off that circumcision represented.

He was experiencing the circumcision of judgment. He was being cut off from us. He was getting what we deserve for not doing the good we know we ought to do. He was taking the penalty at the gate of the Garden of Eden, barring Adam and Eve going  back was a flaming sword, the sword of God's judgment.

But the sword came down on Jesus. He was cut off so now we can go in. As you see, now did you hear all that? As you think about Jesus doing that for you.

As you think about Him doing it for you. As you think about how Jesus Christ procured a new heart for you. Does it move you? Is the way He procured the new heart moves you?

That's the beginning of the new heart in you. Did you understand that? See if you just ask God, oh God, give me a new heart. Why?

No, for blessing. Because I just need something in my life, never work. But if you look at what Jesus Christ did, if what Jesus Christ did, His cutting off, His  experiences, what He did for you. If that moves you, if what He did to procure your new heart moves you, that's the beginning  of the new heart in you.

Why? That's the beauty that makes pleasure and duty one. Because the Him goes, our pleasure and our duty, though opposite before, since we have  seen His beauty are joined to part no more, but what is the beauty? The next verse goes, to see the law by Christful filled and hear His pardoning voice, transforms  a slave into a child and duty into choice.

The beauty of what Jesus Christ did on the cross, taking your cosmic cutting off for you. If that moves you, then that's the beginning of the new heart in you. You wouldn't be moved except God's already working. Isn't that amazing?

He's already working. You know, birth isn't something you can just decide to do. Nobody ever says, I think I get born. Birth is something that happens to you, but you're active in it.

And that's what I'm suggesting to you. Do you have this new heart if you don't, then look at what Jesus Christ did. And if it begins to move you so that you say, now give me this new heart, not because  of anything I have done, but because of what Jesus Christ has done, He took it all for  me. That's the beginning of the new heart.

You wouldn't even be asking, except God's already working in you. That's how you get the new birth. That's how it works. And guess what?

If you've already got the new life in you, maybe you've had it for many years. That's also how the new life is stirred up to greater organic growth. Look at what He did and receive it. Let's pray.

Thank you, Father, for giving us what we need in order to have new hearts, and then to have  that new life in us stirred up. So we pray that you would show us the beauty of what Jesus did and weld together, our  pleasure and our duty. So that you, O Lord, Jesus Christ, become the center of our lives. We pray this in Jesus' name, amen.

Thanks for listening to today's teaching. It's our prayer that you were encouraged by it and that it helps you apply the gospel  to your life and share it with others. As you may know, August is going to share month of gospel in life. We believe God uses small acts to do great things.

## 中文翻译

凯勒继续今天的教导。现在，是的，听着，对于那些以前听过这个例子的人，请耐心一点，但很多人没有听过。这是我在这个主题上最喜欢和最好的例子。当我在大学时，我选修了一门音乐欣赏课程，我必须听很多莫扎特，因为考试会考，我必须能够识别莫扎特。我听莫扎特是为了在课程中及格，以便获得学位，然后找到一份好工作。换句话说，我听莫扎特是为了赚钱。但今天，我和我的妻子会花很多钱只是为了听莫扎特。发生了什么？为什么我们现在听莫扎特？为了得到好成绩吗？不，我不在课堂上。人们会认为我有文化吗？不，没有人看到我听莫扎特。那么，为什么你听莫扎特？你知道，你可以说，我不知道，但这意味着，它是美丽的。过去，听莫扎特是有用的。但现在，它是美丽的，美丽意味着它本身就是令人满意的。它是吸引人的。它本身就是充实的。它不是达到某个目的的手段。你不因为它会给你带来其他东西而去做。它是你想要的。它是给你生活意义的事情之一。现在，这就是爱德华所说的。一个有新心的人不再只是因为必须而顺服神，或者因为顺服神会带你去别的地方。而是开始从美学上发现神本身的美丽，只是为了接近他，只是为了取悦他。你看，没有新心的人顺服神是为了得到东西，为了得到宽恕，为了得到祝福，为了得到天堂。他们顺服神是为了得到东西，但有新心的人顺服神只是为了得到神，只是为了接近他，只是为了取悦他。结果，有这种新心的人可能实际上已经在教会多年，并且了解各种教义。但一旦你得到新心，教义就开始活起来。也就是说，它们曾经是抽象的，但现在它们变得极具激励性和动人，改变生活，这让我想到了第三点。哦，第二点，抱歉，第二点。所以改变心的第一个标志，一个受割礼的心，是你因为他本身的存在而爱神，而不是仅仅相信一个数学公式。但其次，它改变了你的生活。它改变了你。你看，这段经文的整个重点，整个推动力是，因为你有了这个改变的心，现在你顺服，对吗？你不是为了得到改变的心而顺服。改变的心不是顺服的结果。顺服是改变的心的结果。改变的心是恩典的礼物，从改变的心流出一种现在符合神律法的快乐无私的生活。但你知道这意味着什么吗？如果你真的有一个新心，你会改变。你看，有些人会说，哦，我喜欢你刚才说的关于耶稣感动我的话。好，我喜欢来Redeemer教会。歌曲感动我。讲道感动我。很好。我喜欢你的仆人。那太好了。但约翰·爱德华不为所动，除非这里是真正的。约翰·爱德华说，我很高兴你喜欢蒂姆·凯勒的仆人。我很高兴。也许他们让你感到虚弱。那太好了。你觉得，哦，我真的感受到了神的属灵现实。好吧，让我们看看。那些最了解你的人，那些真正看到你的人，他们是否说你变得越来越无私，越来越慷慨，越来越善良，越来越自控，越来越勇敢，随着时间的推移？如果你没有在实际生活中改变，那么你就没有那个新心。你只是被激动了。你的情感被激动了。仅此而已。要有一个新心，你对神的属灵现实有了新的感觉。其次，你有了改变的生活，但第三，你开始成长。我喜欢，你知道，你几乎会错过它，除非你在寻找它。仔细地。第6节说，主你的神会割除你的心，使你爱他并活着，活着。这是什么意思？他们以前不是活着的吗？这不是在谈论生物学上的生命，而是在谈论属灵的生命。这里重要的是。生物学上的生命是逐渐来的，属灵的生命也是如此。所以我相信你们中的一些人对这前两点有点担心。你知道，爱神，意味着他成为你生命中的终极美丽，你开始改变，你开始说，好吧，我不，嗯，嗯。你知道，好吧，这一点可能对你来说。想想生物学上的生命是如何开始的。看看婴儿。看看他们。他们是篮子里的案例。他们什么都做不了。他们什么都做不了。你有没有过一个婴儿？我的意思是，他们只是拿和拿，他们什么都做不了。你必须带他们到处走。你必须一直保护他们免受细胞的伤害。我不能告诉你多少次，我的一个孩子18个月大时，他们在尖叫和哭泣，我说，我只有好的理由和你说话，没有帮助。但想想这有多慢，嗯，属灵的生命，看，尽管在你心被割礼的那一刻，你接受了新心的那一刻，有一种新的爱植入了你。它是一个种子，需要很长时间才能长成一棵树。只是需要时间。你知道，保罗在罗马书7章中说，我在我内心最深处喜悦神的律法。嗯，那是一个新的，那是一个受割礼的心。他说我最想要的东西，我最热爱的东西是我想取悦他。然而他说，我看到我生活中的所有其他欲望仍然与之竞争，它们在许多情况下把我从我应该做的事情中拉走。我在进步，但你知道，这是逐渐的，是间歇性的，需要时间，是的。但它也是有机的，我所说的有机是这样的。真正的属灵，一个真正的新心是有机成长的，而不是机械的。现在，例如，你可以增长一堆砖头，不是吗？你可以只是把，如何增长一堆砖头？你只需继续往上扔砖头，它在增长，但它是通过外部动作增长的，它只是在数量上增长。但现在一个球茎如何长成郁金香？那也是成长，但它是有机成长，而不是机械成长。它是从内部成长的，而不是从外部成长的，它是在质量上，在复杂性上成长。生物体变得越来越复杂。它不仅仅是在数量上增长，而是真正的属灵成长，一个新心的标志是你不仅仅是机械地成长，你不仅仅是学习更多的圣经文本，学习更多的教义，获得更多的完美出勤奖，升职在教会中，积累善行。你不知道，有机地，随着岁月的流逝，你变得更有智慧，更深刻，同时更快乐和更悲伤，更柔和，更敏感于他人，同时更快乐自己，更能承认自己的错误，同时更坚韧和柔和，你在恩典中成长，你在属灵生命中成长，你在属灵品格中成长。与仅仅机械成长非常不同。你有这个心吗？你有这个心吗？也许我应该，这个新心，也许我看，一些人会说，好吧，你重生了吗？我在问你。你们中的一些人可能会说，好吧，那是给某些人的。有些人重生了，有时他们有艰难的生活，这对他们有帮助。耶稣对尼哥底母说，社区的支柱，圣经教师，你必须重生，句号。如果尼哥底母需要重生，他是如此的好和伟大，任何人都必须重生，这就是耶稣的观点。你说，好吧，我不知道，你在谈论一种戏剧性的转换体验，不一定。当约翰·卫斯理，卫理公会教会的创始人，描述他的转换体验时。他在一个会议上，他们在读圣经或读一本关于圣经的书。他说，描述他的转换体验，我的心被奇怪地温暖了。现在，也许对于一个英国人来说，这很戏剧性，但换句话说。但你可以有这样的经历，却不知道那是你新心的开始。可能是几周后，几个月后，几年后你回头看，说，那是新属灵意识的开始，那是开始，我不再只是知道神，而是开始成为属灵现实。那是所有变化开始的地方，有时它并不戏剧化。你不会立即知道，你必须回头找到它。但你必须重生，你必须让你的心受割礼，你必须得到一个新心。你有吗？你在自己身上看到这些东西吗？如果没有，你如何得到它？这是我的建议。不要说，神，给我一个新心。你知道，我需要一个新心，为什么？因为我想成为一个更好的人。它不会那样来。这里是我想让你做的。我想让你看看神是如何获得新心的。神是如何为我们获得新心的？看，我们被放逐了。我们被流放了。去看亚当和夏娃。你说，好吧，那是犹太人，好吧，亚当和夏娃，那是我们所有人。亚当和夏娃被放在伊甸园，天堂，因为他们想成为自己的主人，自己的救主和主，他们被放逐了，他们被流放了。所以我们都在同一条船上。神怎么可能，尽管我们应得的所有诅咒，只是给我们一个新心？他怎么能做到？答案在割礼的仪式中。让我们回到过去，想一想割礼。你们中的很多人会说，我不想想割礼，好吧。为什么这是以色列人与神立约的方式，你知道，与神立约？为什么？我的意思是，纹身怎么样？剪一缕头发怎么样？为什么是割礼？你知道，恶心和血腥和呃，那就是重点。是的，现在你明白了重点。因为当亚伯拉罕在创世纪15章与神立约时，他走在一只死去动物的撕裂的尸体之间。为什么？当他做出承诺时，他走过死去动物的尸体。为什么？他在演绎不服从的惩罚。他在通过走过尸体来演绎约的诅咒。他在说，我向你承诺我的忠诚，主，如果我不履行我今天承诺的事情，愿我被撕成碎片。这就是割礼。当以色列人受割礼时，他们在说，我们会顺服你。如果我们不顺服你，愿我们被割断？因为割礼是罪的诅咒的演绎，约的诅咒。罪的惩罚是什么？当你撒谎时，它把你与他人隔绝。当你作弊，当你残忍时，它使你孤立。你甚至可以在那里看到它。罪的惩罚，罪的诅咒是放逐。是流放。是被割断。与人隔绝。与国家隔绝。与神隔绝。割礼代表了我们应该经历的事情。割礼。神如何在十字架上给我们一个新心？几个世纪后，在一个下午变成了一个黑暗和暴风雨的夜晚，耶稣被割了。一个矛刺在他的眉上，矛刺在他的侧面，钉子刺在他的手上，他被割了。当他说，我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？发生了什么？他不仅仅是身体上被割。他在以赛亚书53章中说，发生在他身上的事情是什么？他为我们的过犯被刺透，他为我们的罪孽被压伤，带给我们平安的惩罚在他身上，因他的伤我们得医治，因为他被割断了与活人的联系。现在，只有现在，因为你刚刚坐了30分钟的这篇讲道，你才会对歌罗西书2章11和12节中那个奇怪的段落有任何了解。因为当歌罗西书2章11和12节说，基督徒，你们在基督的割礼中受了割礼。在十字架上，你们在基督的洗礼中受了洗礼。你读到这个，你说，什么？但现在也许你明白了。在十字架上，耶稣基督正在经历割礼所代表的宇宙割断。他正在经历审判的割礼。他正在被割断与我们。他正在为我们没有做我们应该做的好事而受到惩罚。在伊甸园的门口，阻止亚当和夏娃回去的是一把燃烧的剑，神的审判之剑。但剑落在耶稣身上。他被割断，所以现在我们可以进去。你看，现在你听到了吗？当你想到耶稣为你做的事情时。当你想到他为你做的事情时。当你想到耶稣基督为你获得新心的方式时。它是否感动你？他获得新心的方式是否感动你？那是你内心新心的开始。你明白了吗？如果你只是请求神，哦，神，给我一个新心。为什么？不，为了祝福。因为我只是需要我生活中的一些东西，永远不会成功。但如果你看看耶稣基督所做的，如果耶稣基督所做的，他的割断，他的经历，他为你所做的。如果那感动你，如果他为你获得新心的方式感动你，那就是你内心新心的开始。为什么？那是使快乐和责任合二为一的美丽。因为赞美诗说，我们的快乐和我们的责任，虽然以前是相反的，自从我们看到了他的美丽，就再也不分开了，但美丽是什么？下一节说，看到基督所成就的律法，听到他的赦免之声，将奴隶变成孩子，将责任变成选择。耶稣基督在十字架上所做的美丽，为你承担宇宙割断。如果那感动你，那么那就是你内心新心的开始。你不会被感动，除非神已经在工作。那不是很神奇吗？他已经在工作。你知道，出生不是你可以决定做的事情。没有人说，我想我会出生。出生是发生在你身上的事情，但你在其中是积极的。这就是我对你的建议。你有这个新心吗？如果没有，那么看看耶稣基督所做的。如果它开始感动你，以至于你说，现在给我这个新心，不是因为我做了什么，而是因为耶稣基督所做的，他为我承担了一切。那就是新心的开始。你甚至不会请求，除非神已经在你里面工作。这就是你如何获得新生。这就是它的工作原理。猜猜看？如果你已经有了新生命在你里面，也许你已经有了很多年。这也是新生命被激发到更大的有机成长的方式。看看他所做的并接受它。让我们祷告。感谢父神，赐给我们我们需要的东西，以便拥有新心，然后让那新生命在我们里面被激发。所以我们祈求你向我们展示耶稣所做的美丽，并将我们的快乐和责任焊接在一起。使你，哦主，耶稣基督，成为我们生活的中心。我们奉耶稣的名祈祷，阿门。感谢收听今天的教导。我们祈祷你受到鼓励，并且它帮助你将福音应用到你的生活中并与他人分享。如你所知，八月将是福音生活的分享月。我们相信神使用小行动来做大事。如果你已经采取了一步，也许你分享了一个资源或开始为某人祈祷。我们很想知道。你可以通过在我们的去分享地图上标记你的位置来鼓励他人。只需访问gospelandlife.com/share并让我们知道你参与了。
