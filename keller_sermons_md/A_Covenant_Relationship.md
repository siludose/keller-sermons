. Again, that's Gospel and Life.com-slash-give. There's a conditional rank addition. Now listen.

The problem is that the Bible over and over and over again seems to give contradictory answers. And this is so pervasive and it's so apparently irreconcilable that almost every one of us tends to come down on one side of the other instead of following the biblical balance. What do I mean by that? Most people either fall into one or the other.

Most people either read the Bible in a liberal way. And that is they say, yes, you need to obey. Yes, you should obey the Ten Commandments. Yes, you should be good.

But in the end God loves everybody and will accept everybody. Or you can come down on a conservative side. And you can say, well, yes, God is very loving. But in the end, you've got to be good or he won't love you.

Everybody comes down on one or the other. Everybody says law is the reality and love is secondary. In other words, basically the promises and blessings of God are conditional. Or they say, no, love is more real than law.

Love is the important thing. The law is secondary and therefore they believe that the blessings of God are basically unconditional. And so everybody, because they don't understand how to resolve this tension at the heart of the covenant,  tends to slide toward relativism or moralism, toward being a sadducee or being a Pharisee,  toward basically feeling like, I pretty much can live the way I want to, ultimately, because God's going to love me anyway,  or feeling guilt-ridden and condemned because you're never living up. But the Bible doesn't resolve it all through the Hebrew scriptures, all through the Old Testament.

And there's one place where God actually says, in Judges 2, verse 1,  I said, I would never break my covenant with you. And then two verses later he says,  I also said, I will not bless you if you disobey me. Michael Wilcock, who is a commentator, writing a comment here on the book of Judges, puts it like this. It's almost as if God is saying, I have sworn to bless you, and I also have sworn not to bless a disobedient people.

What is this you have done to me? And by what fearful means do you think I am to solve this situation? Well, how do you resolve it? How do you resolve it?

The answer is in the second half of verse 13, because in the second half of verse 13  it says that he may be your God as he promised you and as he swore to your father's Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Now, where did God take the covenant oath? Where did God take the oath? And where did he take the oath to Abraham?

It's in Genesis 15. And if you understand what happens in Genesis 15, you are at the very heart of what the Bible is all about. In Genesis 15, God has said to Abraham, I will bless you. But Abraham says, how do I know?

How can I be sure? So God says, well here's what I want you to do. I want you to kill some animals  and to cut the animals into pieces and arrange the pieces in two rows with an aisle so you can walk through them. Now you and I are utterly confused by that, but Abraham wasn't.

Because in those days when a great Lord wanted to make a covenant with a peon or a peasant or a lesser vassal or servant, that's how it was done. Animals were slain, the pieces were arranged, and when the servant took the oath of loyalty to the Lord,  the servant did so as he was walking between the pieces. Why? He was acting out the curse of the covenant.

He was saying, I swear loyalty to you, O Lord, and if I do not keep my promise, may I be cut into pieces like this. So Abraham figured if he was arranging a situation for a covenant ceremony,  and so he cut the pieces up and he expected that he would be called to walk through because the Lord's never walked through the pieces. So he waited, and he waited. And then all of a sudden Genesis 15 tells us, incredible darkness came down.

It was the darkness of judgment, and in the midst of the darkness was God. He appeared as a smoking fiery pillar just like at Mount Sinai later on. And he passed through the pieces as he promised to bless Abraham. Now Abraham was startled, and almost every commentator who's ever tried to come to grips with Genesis 15 is startled,  because what that means is God is not just saying, I will bless you, but he's promising to die if he doesn't bless him.

He's promising to be torn to pieces if he doesn't bless Abraham. Well, that's amazing. Sure, it's amazing, but that's not all. Abraham had two shocks.

The first shock was that God went through the pieces, but the second shock was that Abraham was never called to go through the pieces himself. The ceremony ended, and we're told in chapter 15, verse 18, and therefore God made a covenant with Abraham, but this was unheard of. Unheard of. It was amazing for the Lord to come and walk through the pieces, but for the servant not even to make the oath?

Do you know what that meant? Abraham knew what it meant, though he didn't see how it could be. It meant God was making the promise for both of them, and he was taking the curse of the covenant on for both of them. And what he was doing was he was saying, not only will I be torn to pieces if I don't keep my promise.

I'll be torn to pieces if you don't. Oh, Abraham, Abraham, God is saying, and to all of us, oh, world, I will bless you no matter what. Even if it means that my immortality must become mortal. Even if my glory must be drowned in darkness, even if I have to literally be torn to pieces, and he was.

Because centuries later, darkness came down on Mount Calvary, thick darkness, and the midst of the darkness,  there was God in the person of Jesus Christ, and he was literally being torn to pieces, nails, spears, thorns. Why? He was taking the covenant curse. And it's Paul, who says, Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us.

He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to us all through Jesus Christ. You know what that means? This is the answer to all the riddles. Paul says in Romans 4, this is how God can be both just and justifier of those who believe.

I mean, this is the ultimate blend of law and love. How so? Don't you see? Class?

Are the blessings of God conditional or unconditional? Yes. Yes, why? Because on the cross, Jesus Christ absolutely fulfilled the conditions of the law so that God could love you absolutely unconditionally.

With his perfect life, Jesus Christ completely fulfilled the terms of the covenant, verse 9, and he earned the blessing. But with his sacrificial death, he completely fulfilled the curse of the covenant. And that leaves the blessing for you and me, and anyone who lifts the empty hands of faith and asks for it. Jesus Christ fulfilled the conditions of the covenant so that we could be received unconditionally.

And that is the reason why when my wife and I, 33 years ago, Kathy and I walked out of a class in Old Testament covenant theology, 33 years ago this month. And for the first time that was explained to us, Jesus' perfect life earned the blessing, his sacrificial death, took the curse, that leaves the blessing for you. That's what God Paul is saying in Genesis in Galatians 3. When we walked out, we looked at each other and we said, I think I finally understand the gospel.

We said it to each other. Do you? And if you do, let me just quickly apply this. If you understand this finally, number one, it will lead you into paradoxical obedience.

What do I mean by paradoxical obedience? Until you grasp the covenant, until you grasp covenant theology, until you grasp the gospel. I said, you have a tendency to either look at the law as something that is you've got obey or God's going to get you. So you either look at the blessings of God as conditional.

So you're always feeling like I'm not living up. You always feel kind of a sense of condemnation. Or you basically believe God just loves everybody unconditionally. And you feel like the law is a good thing, but you don't take it all that seriously.

But when you understand that Jesus Christ fulfilled the conditions at radical, infinite cost to himself,  so that we could be loved unconditionally. Now, when I look at the law of God, first of all, the law of God is the conditions of the covenant. And I say, I've got to take those things seriously, really seriously, because Jesus died to fulfill this. This is important.

And so with all my might, I try to obey. With every fiber of my being, I try to obey the will and will of God in terms of the covenant. But when I fail, and I will fail, and I do fail, I know there's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. Because my obedience is a way of saying thank you to God.

And it's a way of becoming like God, but it's not a way of earning my way into God. And therefore, if you understand the gospel, there's this fascinating balance in your attitude toward the law. You resist sin like crazy, and you never have a sense of condemnation and despair when you fall into it. Huh?

Isn't that amazing? And no one else has that kind of balance. So first of all, it leads to paradoxical obedience. Secondly, it leads to absolute trust.

It's scary to get married, you know why? Because two people say, I'm going to give everything for you. How do you know? How do they know?

How do they know about you? How do you know about you? See, when two people come together, you say, I'm going to sacrifice for you. I'm going to give my life for you.

I'm going to do everything for you. And you're not really sure whether the other person will do it. You're not even sure if you will do it. It's kind of scary to get married.

That's another sermon. But when Jesus Christ calls you into a covenant relationship, you know what He's saying? I want to marry you. I want you to come into a legally binding, intimate love relationship with me.

I want to marry you, but you don't have to be uncertain because I've already taken the plunge of love. I've already gone to the mat. I've already died for you. Oh, trust him.

What more could anyone do than that? Thirdly, covenant theology not only gives you paradoxical obedience and absolute trust,  it also leads to church membership. Oh yeah, you know why? Because once you understand the gospel, accountability is not this horrible thing.

In fact, you also understand accountability is good for you. And therefore, throughout the history of the Bible,  you'll see that people who get into a covenant relationship with each other  are also in a covenant relationship with God, are also in a covenant relationship with others  who have that covenant relationship with God. They are accountable to other believers. They don't just come to church like a consumer, but they covenant and they say,  I'm accountable.

I support. I'm responsible here. In other words, they join the churches. They don't just come.

Do you understand the gospel? That's one of the implications. Paradoxical obedience, absolute trust, church membership,  and getting serious, finally, about God. You see, modern spirituality gives you a wispy God  who's kind of anything you want Him to be, but covenant theology gives you a crunchy God.

A God that's real, a God that bites back. C.S. Lewis puts it like this. Quote, an impersonal God, well and good.

A subject of God of beauty, truth and goodness inside our own heads. Better still. A formless life force, surging through everyone, a vast power which we can all tap. Best of all.

But a living God, pulling at the other end of the cord,  approaching at infinite speed, the hunter, the covenant lord,  the husband, that is quite another matter. There comes a moment when people who have been dabbling in religion suddenly draw back. Supposing you really find Him, we never meant it to come to that. We're still supposing He found you.

If there is a God, you are in a sense alone with Him. You cannot put Him off with speculations about your neighbor's hypocrisy  or memories of what you have read in books. What will all that chatter in hearsay count when the anesthetic fog,  we call the real world, fades away, and the divine presence in which you have always stood,  becomes palpable, immediate and unavoidable. I invite you into a serious relationship with a covenant God.

Let's pray. Our Father, give us a deep understanding of the gospel. So our lives can really be changed, buy it and through it. We thank You for giving us Your Son.

And therefore, we now, in turn, give You ourselves. We pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.

## 中文翻译

圣经中反复出现的一个问题是，它似乎给出了矛盾的答案。这种矛盾如此普遍，以至于我们中的大多数人倾向于站在其中一边，而不是遵循圣经的平衡。大多数人要么以自由的方式阅读圣经，认为神爱每一个人并接纳每一个人；要么以保守的方式阅读，认为神是有爱的，但最终你必须表现良好，否则神不会爱你。每个人都倾向于滑向相对主义或道德主义。

> 士师记2章1节中，神说：“我曾说，我必不废弃与你们所立的约。”但在两节之后，他又说：“你们若不顺从，我就不赐福给你们。”

迈克尔·威尔科克评论说，似乎神在说：“我发誓要赐福给你们，但我也发誓不赐福给不顺从的百姓。”那么，如何解决这个问题呢？答案在创世记15章中，神与亚伯拉罕立约。

在创世记15章中，神对亚伯拉罕说：“我必赐福给你。”但亚伯拉罕问：“我怎么知道呢？”于是神让他杀一些动物，并将它们切成两半，排成两行。亚伯拉罕知道这意味着什么，因为在那个时代，当一个大主与一个小仆立约时，就是这样做的。仆人走过这些动物的尸体，表示如果他不履行承诺，就会像这些动物一样被切成两半。

然而，在创世记15章中，神自己走过了这些尸体，而亚伯拉罕没有被要求走过。这意味着神不仅承诺赐福给亚伯拉罕，还承诺如果他不赐福，就会被撕裂。更令人震惊的是，亚伯拉罕没有被要求走过这些尸体，这意味着神为双方做出了承诺，并承担了约的诅咒。

几个世纪后，黑暗降临在加略山上，耶稣基督在十字架上被撕裂，钉子、长矛、荆棘。保罗说：“基督为我们成了诅咒，救赎了我们，使亚伯拉罕的福可以临到我们。”这就是福音的答案。

> 罗马书4章中，保罗说，这就是神如何既为公义又为信者的称义者。

理解福音的意义在于，它会引导你进入一种矛盾的顺服。你会努力遵守神的律法，因为耶稣为此付出了极大的代价，但当你失败时，你知道在基督耶稣里没有定罪。

理解福音还会带来绝对的信任。耶稣基督邀请你进入一种契约关系，他已经为你付出了最大的爱。

最后，理解福音会引导你加入教会，因为你会明白责任和问责是有益的。
