Welcome to Gospel in Life. During January, we're inviting our listeners to consider becoming a Gospel in Life monthly partner. If you'd like to learn more, keep listening at the end of today's podcast for details. Do you ever wish life came with an owner's manual, a guide to follow when you're facing difficult decisions or just trying to live with integrity in the small everyday moments? Today on Gospel in Life, Tim Keller shows us how the Ten Commandments help us align our lives with God's will, not by restricting us with outdated rules, but by laying the foundation from which we can live a life of true freedom and flourishing.

And now, brothers, we want you to know about the grace that God has given to the Macedonian churches. Out of the most severe trial, their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity, for I testify that they gave as much as they were able, and even beyond their ability, entirely on their own, they urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the saints. And they did not do as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us in keeping with God's will. So we urge Titus, since he had earlier made a beginning, to bring also to completion this act of grace on your part. But just as you excel in everything, in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in your love for us, see that you excel in this grace of giving. I am not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others. For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that through his poverty you might become rich.

We're returning to a series that we gave up about a month ago for Christmassy themes, and that's a series on the Ten Commandments. The Ten Commandments, we're saying, are like high steel. You know, the high girders that have to be thrust up into the sky so that a skyscraper can be built on it? In the same way, the Ten Commandments are high steel. The Ten Commandments are not confining chains, chains that confine our human potentiality, nor are the Ten Commandments busy work from some cosmic algebra teacher who's trying to keep us off the streets. Rather, the Ten Commandments are high steel, a framework on which to build a life of greatness.

Money, this shouldn't come to a surprise in this city, money is really just a measure of your power. Money is power. The more money you have, the more choices you have. The more of the world you control, the more choices you have, the more power you have. That's all money is. It's a measure of how much of the world you control.

Money was designed to be our dignity. There's no human dignity without money. Money answers to something God put down deep in us, and that is we all need to have part of the world to care for. And without any part of the world to care for, we have no dignity. So money is supposed to be our dignity, but what has happened in most of our lives because of sin and the effects of sin on us, money has not, instead of being our dignity, money has become our definition. And that's different. And what that does then is that turns money into a destructive power in your life.

The three principles that Paul talks about are these. Number one, God owns everything that you've got. Number two, Jesus impoverished himself for you. And number three, you can take it with you. God owns everything you've got, so you've got to act like a trustee. Jesus gave everything for you, so you're free for radical generosity. And you can take it with you if you invest it in eternal things.

There's two kinds of thievery. The first kind of thievery is when we refuse to honor the caretaker rights of other human beings. The second kind of stealing is you've got to honor the owner's rights over your own wealth or you're stealing. In Malachi chapter 3, God says, will you rob me? How can you rob God? You rob me in tithes and offerings.

Robert Murray McShane was a Scottish minister who preached in Scotland over 150 years ago, and he said: "Oh, my dear friends, if you would be like Christ, and you pray that you will be, become like him in giving. Though he was rich, yet for our sakes he became poor. Objection, someone says. My money is my own. Answer. Well, Christ might have said, my blood is my own, my life is my own, and then where would you be? My dear Christians, if you want to be like Christ, give much, give often, give freely, even to the vile, even to the undeserving. Christ is glorious and happy, and so shall you be. It's not your money I want. It's your happiness. Remember his own word. It's more blessed. It's more happy to give than to receive."

### 中文翻译

欢迎来到《福音生活》。在一月份，我们邀请听众考虑成为《福音生活》的月度伙伴。你是否曾希望人生有一本使用手册，一本在面对困难决定或只是在日常小事中努力正直生活时可以遵循的指南？今天在《福音生活》中，蒂姆·凯勒向我们展示十诫如何帮助我们使生活与神的旨意一致，不是用过时的规则来限制我们，而是奠定基础，让我们可以过上真正自由和繁荣的生活。

**经文（哥林多后书 8:1-15）：**

弟兄们，我们要把神赐给马其顿众教会的恩典告诉你们。在极大的患难中，他们的喜乐满溢，在极度贫穷之中，他们仍然慷慨施舍。我可以作证，他们是按着自己的力量，甚至超过自己的力量，自愿地捐献；他们再三请求我们，准许他们参与供给圣徒的恩情。他们所作的，不是照我们所期望的，而是照着神的旨意，先把自己献给主，然后献给我们。因此，我们劝提多，既然他先前开始了这件美事，就应该完成你们所行的这种恩惠。你们既然在信心、口才、知识、热心和对我们的爱心上都充足，也要在这慈惠的事上充足。我这样说，不是命令你们，而是藉着别人的热心来试验你们的爱心是否真诚。你们知道我们主耶稣基督的恩典：他本来是富足的，却为你们成了贫穷，使你们因他的贫穷成为富足。

**十诫是高钢架：**

我们回到一个月前为圣诞主题而中断的系列——十诫系列。十诫就像高钢架。你知道那些必须伸向天空的高梁，以便在上面建造摩天大楼吗？十诫就是这样。十诫不是限制人类潜能的枷锁，也不是某个宇宙代数老师为了让我们远离街头而布置的忙碌作业。相反，十诫是高钢架，是建造伟大人生的框架。

**金钱就是权力：**

金钱——在这个城市这不应该让人惊讶——金钱实际上只是你权力的衡量。金钱就是权力。你拥有的钱越多，你的选择就越多。你控制的世界越多，你的选择就越多，你的权力就越大。这就是金钱的全部。它是衡量你控制世界多少的标准。

**金钱本是尊严，却成了定义：**

金钱本是为了我们的尊严。没有金钱就没有人的尊严。金钱回应了神放在我们内心深处的东西——我们都需要有世界的一部分来照顾。没有任何世界的一部分来照顾，我们就没有尊严。所以金钱应该是我们的尊严，但在我们大多数人的生活中，由于罪和罪对我们的影响，金钱不再是我们的尊严，而是成了我们的定义。这是不同的。这样做会把金钱变成你生命中的破坏性力量。

**财务自由的三个原则：**

保罗谈到的三个原则是：第一，神拥有你所拥有的一切。第二，耶稣为你成为贫穷。第三，你可以带走它。神拥有你所拥有的一切，所以你必须像管家一样行事。耶稣为你付出了一切，所以你可以自由地激进慷慨。如果你把它投资在永恒的事物上，你就可以带走它。

**两种偷盗：**

有两种偷盗。第一种偷盗是当我们拒绝尊重其他人的管理权。第二种偷盗是你必须尊重所有者对你自己财富的权利，否则你就是在偷盗。在玛拉基书第三章，神说：你们竟敢抢夺我？你们怎能抢夺神呢？你们在十一奉献和供物上抢夺我。

**慕安德烈论效法基督的给予：**

慕安德烈是150多年前在苏格兰传道的苏格兰牧师，他说："哦，亲爱的朋友们，如果你想像基督，你祈祷你会像他，那就在给予上像他。他本来是富足的，却为我们成了贫穷。有人反对说：我的钱是我自己的。回答：好吧，基督可能会说，我的血是我自己的，我的生命是我自己的，那你会在哪里呢？亲爱的基督徒，如果你想像基督，就多给，常给，自由地给，甚至给卑鄙的人，甚至给不配的人。基督是荣耀的、快乐的，你也将如此。我想要的不是你的钱，而是你的幸福。记住他自己的话：施比受更为有福。"
