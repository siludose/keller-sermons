### Introduction: Public Faith

How comfortable are you when it comes to being open about your faith? This month on the podcast, Tim Keller looks at what the Bible says about having a public faith. He shows us what it looks like to be open about our faith in a pluralistic society in a way that creates civility and peace and meaningful dialogue with our neighbors.

Tonight's scripture reading comes from Exodus, chapter 3, verses 1 through 14.

> "Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horib, the mountain of God. There an angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that the bush was on fire and it did not burn up. So Moses thought, I will go over and see the strange sight why the bush does not burn up."

**When the Lord saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush. Moses, Moses, and Moses said, here I am. Do not come any closer, God said. Take off your sandals for the place where you are standing as holy ground.**

### Moses and the Burning Bush

Then he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. At this Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at God. The Lord said, I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers and I am concerned about their suffering. So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land. A land flowing with milk and honey, the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Parasites, Hivites, and Jebysites.

> "And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them. So now go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt."

But Moses said to God, who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt? And God said, I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you. When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain.

### Four Elements to Meet God

Moses said to God, suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, the God of your fathers has sent me to you and they ask me, what is his name? Then what shall I tell them? God said to Moses, I am who I am. This is what you are to say to the Israelites. I am has sent me to you. The word of the Lord, thanks be to God.

Now, each week we are looking at the subject of how we can talk about our deepest faith beliefs in public, how can we share who we are, our deep faith beliefs, but in such a way that is respectful, promotes peace, and I have observed over the years that one of the best ways of having a discussion about faith publicly is to not simply talk about what you believe, but also how you came to believe it.

### Disrupting Sight

The first thing that brings Moses to actually meet God is the bush itself, verse two and three. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire, it did not burn up, so Moses thought, I will go over and see this strange sight, why the bush is not consumed, does not burn up.

**Now, Moses probably originally saw a brush fire over here, some distance, but that wasn't all that unusual, there's a lot of reasons why you can have brush fires in the desert, but what caught his attention was this fire didn't go out.**

### Expanding Concept

Why does God reveal himself as fire? One of the reasons is he's getting across one of the most mind-numbing, amazing things that the Bible says about God. See, the reason Moses went to see the bush was bushes are usually dependent on the, I mean, pardon me, fire is usually dependent on the bush. It's dependent on the bush for fuel.

**And therefore, fires don't stay going forever because they have to have fuel. And after they consume the fuel, they're gone. Why? They're dependent on the fuel. But this fire wasn't dependent on the bush. It wasn't dependent on anything. It had its own power of being within it, which of course was a miracle.**

### Personal Problem

There are a number of things that God was getting across with fire, and here's one of them. Fire is so beautiful and so scary at once. It is so brilliant and so attractive and so dangerous and so frightening at once.

> "Moses said, here I am, verse 5, do not come any closer, God said, take off your sandals for the place where you were standing is holy ground. At this Moses hit his face because he was afraid to look at God."

### Surprising Grace

Moses is wondering about that. Down here in verse 11 and 12, Moses says, but who am I that you would send me to Pharaoh and then God says, I will be with you but if you go on in the text, you'll see Moses is not modified here. Moses says, wait a minute, you're holy. He's starting to see who he is, what he's like and he begins to say, how in the world am I?

**Well put it like this, the bush is not consumed but why isn't Moses? In Exodus 33, Moses actually asked God, can I see you face to face and God says no, you can't, it will kill you. Well then why is it not consumed right here? The bush isn't consumed, okay, it was a miracle but why isn't Moses consumed and the secret and the answer, it's in the text but you probably went right by it, I do.**

Look all through here, it says God spoke to Moses out of the bush. God spoke to Moses out of the bush, God spoke to Moses out of the bush but who's actually in the bush? It tells you in verse 2, the angel of the Lord.

> "Wait a minute you say that's weird, it says the angel was in the bush but then all the way through the rest of the text it talks as if God's in the bush, yes, that's the way it works in the Old Testament."

### Conclusion

Father, we thank you for giving us this pathway to experience of you and we ask that you would help us now even as we participate in the Lord's Supper to know you. That is an abstract God but is a fiery loving God. We pray that you would help every Christian here experience your reality and everyone here who is not yet know you also come to experience that reality we ask it in Jesus' name. Amen.

## 中文翻译

### 引言：公开的信仰

当谈到公开你的信仰时，你有多自在？在本月的播客中，Tim Keller 探讨了圣经对公开信仰的看法。他向我们展示了在多元化社会中如何以一种创造文明、和平和有意义的对话的方式公开我们的信仰。

今晚的经文来自出埃及记第三章，第一至十四节。

> “摩西牧养他岳父米甸祭司叶忒罗的羊群，领羊群到旷野的尽头，来到神的山，就是何烈山。耶和华的使者从荆棘中火焰里向摩西显现。摩西看见荆棘被火烧着，却没有烧毁。摩西说，我要过去看这大异象，这荆棘为何没有烧毁。”

**当耶和华见他过去要看，神从荆棘中呼叫他说，摩西，摩西。他说，我在这里。神说，不要近前来，当把你脚上的鞋脱下来，因为你所站之地是圣地。**

### 摩西与燃烧的荆棘

然后他说，我是你父亲的神，是亚伯拉罕的神，以撒的神，雅各的神。摩西蒙上脸，因为怕看神。耶和华说，我实在看见了我百姓在埃及所受的困苦，我也听见他们因受督工的辖制所发的哀声，我原知道他们的痛苦。我下来是要救他们脱离埃及人的手，领他们出了那地，到美好宽阔流奶与蜜之地，就是迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人之地。

> “现在以色列人的哀声达到我耳中，我也看见埃及人怎样欺压他们。所以现在我要打发你去见法老，使你可以将我的百姓以色列人从埃及领出来。”

摩西对神说，我是谁，竟能去见法老，将以色列人从埃及领出来呢？神说，我必与你同在。这就是我打发你去的证据，你将百姓从埃及领出来之后，你们必在这山上事奉我。

### 遇见上帝的四个要素

摩西对神说，我到以色列人那里，对他们说，你们祖宗的神打发我到你们这里来，他们若问我说，他叫什么名字，我要对他们说什么呢？神对摩西说，我是自有永有的。又说，你要对以色列人这样说，那自有的打发我到你们这里来。耶和华的话，感谢上帝。

现在，每周我们都在探讨如何在公共场合谈论我们最深的信仰信念，如何分享我们是谁，我们的深信信念，但以一种尊重的方式，促进和平，我多年来观察到，公开讨论信仰的最佳方式之一不是简单地谈论你相信什么，而是你是如何相信的。

### 扰乱的景象

摩西真正遇见上帝的第一件事就是荆棘本身，第二和第三节。摩西看见荆棘被火烧着，却没有烧毁，所以摩西说，我要过去看这大异象，这荆棘为何没有烧毁。

**现在，摩西可能最初看到的是远处的火，但这并不罕见，在沙漠中有很多原因可以引起火灾，但吸引他注意的是这火没有熄灭。**

### 扩展的概念

为什么神以火显现？其中一个原因是他在传达圣经关于神的最令人震惊、惊人的事情之一。看，摩西去看荆棘是因为荆棘通常依赖于，抱歉，火通常依赖于荆棘。它依赖于荆棘作为燃料。

**因此，火不会永远燃烧，因为它们需要燃料。燃料被消耗后，它们就消失了。为什么？因为它们依赖于燃料。但这火不依赖于荆棘。它不依赖于任何东西。它有自己的存在力量，这当然是一个奇迹。**

### 个人问题

神通过火传达了许多事情，这就是其中之一。火既美丽又可怕。它既辉煌又吸引人，同时又危险又令人恐惧。

> “摩西说，我在这里，第五节，神说，不要近前来，当把你脚上的鞋脱下来，因为你所站之地是圣地。摩西蒙上脸，因为怕看神。”

### 惊人的恩典

摩西对此感到疑惑。在第十一和十二节，摩西说，我是谁，你竟打发我去见法老，然后神说，我必与你同在，但如果你继续看经文，你会看到摩西并没有因此而改变。摩西说，等等，你是圣洁的。他开始看到自己是谁，他是什么样的人，他开始说，我怎么可能呢？

**这样说吧，荆棘没有被烧毁，但为什么摩西没有被烧毁呢？在出埃及记33章，摩西实际上问神，我可以面对面见你吗？神说不，你不能，这会杀了你。那么为什么这里没有被烧毁呢？荆棘没有被烧毁，好吧，这是一个奇迹，但为什么摩西没有被烧毁，答案就在经文中，但你可能忽略了，我也是。**

通篇都说神从荆棘中对摩西说话。神从荆棘中对摩西说话，神从荆棘中对摩西说话，但实际上谁在荆棘中？第二节告诉你，是耶和华的使者。

> “等等，你说这很奇怪，它说使者在荆棘中，但在其余的经文中却好像是神在荆棘中，是的，这就是旧约中的运作方式。”

### 结论

父啊，我们感谢你给我们这条通往你体验的道路，我们请求你帮助我们现在，即使我们参与圣餐，也能认识你。不是一个抽象的神，而是一个火热的爱神。我们祈求你帮助这里的每一个基督徒体验你的真实，每一个尚未认识你的人也能体验到这种真实，我们奉耶稣的名祈求。阿门。
