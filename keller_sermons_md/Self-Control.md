### Introduction: The Difference Between Will-Power and Supernatural Change

The Bible says there's a world of difference between a will-power-driven heart and a supernaturally-changed one. Today, Tim Keller is unpacking one of the fruit of the Spirit, helping us see what it means to move from trying to be good to truly changing from the inside out.

Tonight's Scripture reading is found on page 8 in your bulletin, and it comes from 1st Corinthians 9 and 10.

> "I do all this for the sake of the Gospel that I may share in its blessings. Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize. Run in such a way as to get the prize. Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last, but we do it to get a crown that will last forever. Therefore, I do not run like a man running aimlessly. I do not fight like a man beating the air. No, I beat my body and make it my slave, so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize."

### The Biblical Understanding of Self-Control

In Galatians 5, verse 22 and 23, Paul lists nine traits of a supernaturally changed heart. There are also called the fruit of the Spirit, love, joy, peace, patience and so on. And what we've been doing is each week taking one of them and looking at one so that we can see these traits appear in our own lives. And tonight we come to the last one. In the list in Galatians 5, 22 and 23, it's called self-control.

> "Everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things."

**Self-control is self-command.** And actually it's a synonym for being free because if you're not self-controlled, then you're out of control. If you're out of control, then you're a slave to some other forces.

### The Role of the Heart in Self-Control

Paul is using this illustration of the athlete preparing for a game to compete in the game to get across the biblical understanding of self-control. Now we need this because we are not in control. We have trouble controlling our tongues. We have trouble controlling our thoughts. We have trouble controlling our feelings, our impulses, let alone all the millions of addictions that we can also develop like addictions that have to do with drink or drugs or sex or spending or gambling or eating disorders or rage.

- **Mind over emotions**: The ancient Greek idea that the body is bad and the spirit is good.
- **Self-discovery**: The modern idea that suppressing emotions is the problem.

The Bible says neither. **Freedom and self-control is rightly ordering your loves, rightly ordering your passions.**

### The Crown That Lasts Forever

What is that crown that will last forever? What is it? So in other words, how does this self-control really happen in our lives? And the answer is, it's not as simple as you think.

> "I do all this for the sake of the gospel, but I may share in its blessings."

Paul is saying is I'm experiencing some kind of bliss, some kind of joy, some kind of beauty, something in the gospel, and I don't want to enjoy it alone.

### Practical Steps to Grow in Self-Control

The Bible, community, and trouble. Those three things will press you to look to Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith. And the more you look at him and the more you love him and the more you see him, the more your life will come under control.

1. **The Bible**: Be saturated in Scripture so that when the test comes, it comes to mind.
2. **Community**: Open your heart to a few other Christians who can hold you accountable.
3. **Trouble**: Difficulties that drive you into the arms of God and your community.

Let's pray. Our Father, we all struggle with self-control. And actually, our struggles in very many cases are rather secret. Not all of them. Plenty of us have struggles with self-control that all of our friends can see. But there's an awful lot of our struggles that we keep pretty secret. And I pray that you would take the search light of your word, and with the power of your spirit, take these words of the scripture into our hearts where we maybe keep things rather dark. We don't want to admit our problems. We don't know what to do with them. And I pray that the words of this text of the Word of God will illuminate our hearts so we know what we should be doing. We pray that you would help us be more accountable to each other. We would cling more to you, that we would deal with these problems because they're hurting us, and they're hurting, especially, our ability to help other people share in the blessings of the gospel. Oh, Lord, help us. Please help us to grow in grace in the knowledge of your Son, Jesus Christ, and His name we pray. Amen.

### 引言：意志力与超自然改变的区别

圣经说，靠意志力驱动的心与超自然改变的心之间有天壤之别。今天，Tim Keller 正在解读圣灵的果子之一，帮助我们看到从努力做好人到真正从内心改变的意义。

今晚的经文阅读在你的公告第8页，来自哥林多前书9和10。

> “我所做的一切都是为了福音的缘故，以便我可以分享其中的祝福。你们不知道在赛跑中，所有的跑者都在跑，但只有一个能得奖吗？要以得奖的方式跑。参加比赛的人都要严格训练。他们这样做是为了得到一个不会持久的冠冕，但我们这样做是为了得到一个永恒的冠冕。因此，我不像一个漫无目的跑步的人。我不像一个打空气的人。不，我击打我的身体，使它成为我的奴仆，以便在我向别人传道之后，我自己不会因奖赏而被取消资格。”

### 圣经对自我控制的理解

在加拉太书5章22和23节，保罗列出了超自然改变的心的九个特征。这些也被称为圣灵的果子，爱、喜乐、和平、忍耐等等。我们每周都会挑选其中一个进行研究，以便我们可以在自己的生活中看到这些特征的出现。今晚我们来到最后一个。在加拉太书5章22和23节的列表中，它被称为自我控制。

> “参加比赛的人在各方面都要自我控制。”

**自我控制就是自我指挥。** 实际上，它是自由的同义词，因为如果你不自我控制，那么你就失控了。如果你失控了，那么你就是其他力量的奴隶。

### 心灵在自我控制中的角色

保罗使用运动员准备比赛的例子来传达圣经对自我控制的理解。现在我们需要这个，因为我们不在控制之中。我们难以控制我们的舌头。我们难以控制我们的思想。我们难以控制我们的感情，我们的冲动，更不用说我们还可能发展出数以百万计的成瘾，比如饮酒、毒品、性、消费、赌博、饮食失调或愤怒的成瘾。

- **理智压制情感**：古希腊的观点认为身体是坏的，精神是好的。
- **自我发现**：现代观点认为压抑情感是问题所在。

圣经说两者都不是。**自由和自我控制是正确地排列你的爱，正确地排列你的激情。**

### 永恒的冠冕

什么是那永恒的冠冕？那是什么？换句话说，这种自我控制如何真正发生在我们的生活中？答案是，这并不像你想的那么简单。

> “我所做的一切都是为了福音的缘故，以便我可以分享其中的祝福。”

保罗说的是我正在经历某种幸福，某种喜悦，某种美丽，某种福音中的东西，我不想独自享受。

### 增长自我控制的实际步骤

圣经、社区和困难。这三件事会促使你仰望耶稣，我们信心的创始成终者。你越多地仰望他，越多地爱他，越多地看到他，你的生活就越会受到控制。

1. **圣经**：要浸透在圣经中，以便在考验来临时，它会浮现在脑海中。
2. **社区**：向其他基督徒敞开心扉，让他们能对你进行监督。
3. **困难**：驱使你投靠上帝和你的社区的困难。

让我们祷告。我们的父，我们都在与自我控制作斗争。实际上，我们的斗争在许多情况下是相当秘密的。并不是所有的斗争。我们中有很多人有自我控制的问题，所有的朋友都能看到。但我们有很多斗争是我们保密的。我祈求你用你的话语的探照灯，借着你的灵的力量，将这些经文的话语带入我们心中那些我们可能保持黑暗的地方。我们不想承认我们的问题。我们不知道该如何处理它们。我祈求这些经文的话语能照亮我们的心，使我们知道我们应该做什么。我们祈求你帮助我们对彼此更加负责。我们会更加依靠你，我们会处理这些问题，因为它们在伤害我们，尤其是在伤害我们帮助其他人分享福音祝福的能力。哦，主，帮助我们。请帮助我们在你儿子耶稣基督的恩典和知识中成长。奉他的名祷告。阿门。
