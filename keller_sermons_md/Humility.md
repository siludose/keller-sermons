### Introduction: The Challenge of Humility

Welcome to Gospel in Life! Many of us try to change through sheer willpower, conquering bad habits or forcing better behavior, only to find ourselves snapping back to old patterns. In today's message, Tim Keller is exploring the fruit of the Spirit, showing how real transformation isn't about moral restraint, but a heart that through Christ is changed from the inside out. Tonight's scripture reading comes from the book of Philippians, chapter 2, verses 1-11.

> "If you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from His love, if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and purpose. Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves. Each of you should look not only to your own interests but also to the interests of others. Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus, who, being in very nature of God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death, even death on a cross. Therefore, God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth. And every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father."

This is God's Word. This is a great passage on humility that you just had read.

### The Sickness: Pride and Glory Emptiness

When we have talked in the last few months about justice and the poor, I've always sensed that even though it's important, it's what the Bible says, we have the cultural window or back. You know what I mean? The culture says, great, we're really glad that you Christians are thinking about that. We're interested in that too. So you have your window to the back. But when you get to this subject, and this subject is humility, when you get to what the Bible says about humility, we have the cultural window in our face.

Contemporary people, especially contemporary New Yorkers stare at the biblical concept of humility the way a cow stares at a new gate. Recently a commentator on the trends in the culture said this, said humility has come under attack in our society over the last few decades. Self-effacement has become identified with conformity and self-repression. A different ethos came to the fore, which sociologists have called expressive individualism. Instead of being humble before God in history, now in our society, salvation is found through intimate contact with oneself and by exposing the beauty, the power, and even the divinity within.

So that's the approach of our culture and that completely flies in the face of what this text and what the Bible says about the importance of humility. Let's notice three things, this magnificent passage, we could easily do 30 weeks of sermons on just this passage, but we won't. Instead I'll give you a top level look at this, this is going to tell us about a sickness that we have, about what we would look like if we were healthy and how to get the cure. Sickness, a picture of health, and the cure.

**Now the sickness is, find it in verse two and three. Be like-minded he says, have the same love, be one in spirit and purpose. Now he's describing a unified human community, this is what we all want.** We all want to live in a human community that's, there's no fighting and divisions, but there's love and there's oneness of spirit, oneness of mind, and okay, instead we have bombs in time square and political polarization and war, and you say but this is actually talking about the church, right that's the point, the point is there's something wrong with the human heart, so wrong that even inside a body like the church where everybody shares the same faith, there's constant fighting.

The reason Paul's bringing this up is you will know if you read just read on to the end of this short letter, is there's contentions going on between a couple of key figures in the church. Churches are filled with fighting and divisions, just like the rest of the world, why? Because there's something wrong with the heart. What is that? Well, he mentions it. He says, if you're going to have oneness, therefore do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Now, the selfish ambition isn't a particularly illuminating phrase, it really just means the spirit of divisiveness, which is kind of what we know is the problem, but the second phrase is crucial.

The reason why we do things out of selfish ambition, or the reason why we have this division while we're always fighting is because of what he calls, what this translation calls vain conceit, but it's a single Greek word, quinoidoxias, quino means to empty, canosis, to empty oneself, and doxa means glory and honor, respect. What does it mean to be characterized by quinoidoxia? It means to be glory empty, to be hungry for honor, hungry for respect, hungry for that kind of assurance, because you don't feel like you are a person of importance.

**This is radical, cosmic insecurity. This is feeling I don't count, I don't matter, I'm a femoral, I'm a wave upon the sand. I need assurance that I'm okay, that I'm important, that I count, you know, hungry for respect and for glory and for honor. This is the human soul. It's much better. It's much better to be hated and attacked and to be ignored.** Remember at the end of the movie or the play, Amadeus, why is the aging saliary in a kind of living hell? Because as this composer gets old, he's not disliked, he's been forgotten. And because he's been forgotten, that's hell. To be absolutely and finally dismissed and ignored.

Now you see why being glory empty, feeling like I'm not important, I don't count, leads to the division. I mean, you can see it in a street gang. What are street gangs? They're filled with generally young men that do not feel in any way valued by their society and very often not valued or loved by their families, and as a result, they walk down the street and if you slight them, slightly, they'll pull a gun on you. Because they're glory empty. Because they don't feel important, they fight. And you say, well, of course, that's easy to see because, you know, yeah, that's them. They have low self-esteem, et cetera. Yeah, I know, except if you read history, if you just read history, you'll know that nation states have always acted the same way as street gangs, you know, slight them slightly and they go to war. Because it's what we are corporately, it's what we are corporately.

Why? Why are we this way? Well, think of what the Bible says, I don't know of a better diagnosis. The Bible says we were made originally to live forever. But because we've turned away from God, now we're fading. We know. We were made to never be forgotten. We were made to stand in the presence of God and get His favor. We were made to last. But because we've turned away from God, we know we're dying. We know we're fading. We know we're going to be forgotten. We don't feel real. We feel like a wave upon the sand. We feel like a moon beam in the hand and all that. And so we desperately look to everybody we possibly can to get them to say you're good, you're important, you're worthwhile, you know, you'll never be forgotten. You're so significant and we just desperate and that's all we fight.

Lewis Meads, the Christian writer says this about pride because what we're talking about, this hunger for glory is pride. And he says pride is in the spiritual sense, is refusal to let God be God. It's to grab God's status for oneself. It's wishing to be the creator, independent, reliant on one's own resources. And that is the greatest delusion, the delusional fantasy of all fantasies, the cosmic put on, the fantasy that we can make it as our own God's, which is what where everybody is, leaves us empty at the center, you hear that? Leaves us empty at the center and therefore we learn to swagger. We're attacked by demons of fear and anxiety, so we bluff. We look around and whenever we see a new person, we use people as buttresses for the shaky ego that pride created every time you meet a new person, you are unconsciously wondering, how can this person contribute to my need to prove that I count? Life therefore becomes a constant battle to use people to bolster your own self.

So there's the sickness, pride, which is a hunger for glory, a need for respect, a need to be assured that we're real.

### The Picture of Health: True Humility

What would health look like then? If we didn't have this, what would health look like? And the answer is intriguing. It's all summed up in the word humility because see, keep on going. He says in verse two, I want you to be unified. Verse three, a, the first part says, and the reason you're not is because of this emptiness, this vain glory, that's what the King James Bible, which is a little better, it translates, emptiness, you know, devoid of glory. Because of your emptiness, because of your pride, therefore, he says, starting verse 3B, and humility, consider others better than yourselves. Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.

Boy, that tells you a lot, but let me, let's first of all look at the word humility. What is it? It's a simple Greek word that means gentle, modest, deferential, gentle, modest, deferring to others. Outside of the New Testament, this Greek word, whenever it was used in any other kind of ancient Greek literature was always derocatory because in the Greco-Roman society, to be deferential and to be gentle and to be modest, was the attitude of a slave. See, that old society valued strength, and they believed that actually social stability was based on fear. People had a respect to you, they treated you with respect, then society would hold together, and the only way for respect is that people feared you, gentleness, and deference, and modesty. That's for slaves, and yet this word in the Bible, or version of it, is used 270 times and almost always positively.

You realize what a worldview revolution this was in Western culture, the humility, only Christianity comes along. If you go back and you look at the Greeks and you look at the Aristotle and Plato, you look at all their emphasis on virtues, you'll never see humility in there. And yet, do you know how important humility is in the Bible? It's not just important. I want you to think of something for a second. When Jesus says the meek, the humble will inherit the earth. When Jesus says, take my yoke upon me and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest of your souls. What is he saying?

Well, think about the gospel for a second. If you come to God and say, I want to have a relationship with you, look at all my accomplishments, look what I have done. He's going to turn you away saying, you don't know who I am, you don't know who you are, you don't know what the cross of Jesus Christ means. But if you come and say, oh Lord, I repent, I need your grace, I have nothing with which to merit your favor, but I ask that you would save me for Jesus' sake, that's repentance and faith, you're saved by grace, you're saved through faith. But you know what that is? It's humility. The only thing that can kill you, the only thing that can destroy you eternally is the lack of humility. You can lack almost any other thing, but not that, because that's what connects you to God.

In fact, if you want to think about it, basically God's plan of salvation is to lift up the humble. He says so in Luke 1. His plan of salvation is to lift up the humble. You see how important it is. Well, what is it? Well, actually Paul gives a pretty good top level answer, but let me, since one of the advantages of this series has been to give people tools for self-evaluation, let me take you to Jonathan Edwards. He is, he spent a great deal of time, is a Christian minister that spent a great deal of time thinking about spiritual growth and true Christianity, and in a couple of different places, he spends a fair amount of time treating the subject of what is the Bible say humility is. And I have summarized into four things what he says pride is, and therefore opposed, which is opposed to humility, and there are actually pretty good ways for me to look at my own life and to think about myself.

He says pride is opposed to three or four things, and pardon me, pride is four things, and humility therefore is opposed to these four things. Happiness, scorefulness, willfulness, and self-consciousness. Okay, think with me for a minute. First of all, humility is opposed to drivenness. Be careful. It is very possible to be passionate and hard-working and desiring excellence because you love the thing that you are pursuing. If you pursue excellence in art or in music, if you pursue excellence in business or education or your academic field, it might be because you actually love the field. It could be that, for example, you just love running and you love to see people run and you just love the athleticism of it, and if that's the reason why you are running and trying to run faster and faster as an athlete, if it's true that your competitiveness is a joy-driven competitiveness, then you will be almost as happy if your friend breaks the record as if you do.

But that's not how it usually works, is it? Because our competitiveness is not driven by joy, it's driven by an inner vacuum. This is the reason why there's a great place where C.S. Lewis says in his book, Merchristianity, he says, pride, real pride, gets no pleasure out of having something. Pride only gets pleasure out of having more of it than the next person. You may think you're proud of being successful or intelligent or good-looking, but when surrounded by those who are equal or better than you, you lose all pleasure in those things. It's the comparison that makes you proud. It's the pleasure of being above the rest. That's exactly right.

So first of all, Jonathan Edwards says, here's how you can tell if you are a proud person. You're driven. You need to succeed. You're always unhappy with... You didn't do that well, you didn't do it right. You can do better. You're driven. You're restless, but humility is content with circumstances, content with being imperfect. Humility is the opposite of drivenness. Think about that.

Secondly, humility is the opposite of scornfulness. By the way, sometimes you can be sarcastic, especially about a really, really wrongful thing, and you might want to use sarcasm to maybe get your point across. But in general, as I think Edwards rightly says, he says, treating others with contempt, jeering, ridiculing is always a manifestation of pride. Why? Because you're putting people down. That's what we... That's the metaphor we use. You're putting people down, so you can be above them. Instead, humility means treating all those who are lesser than you or opposed to you with courtesy, grace, and affability always. So one of the ways you see pride is drivenness, humility is the opposite of that. One of the ways you see pride is scornfulness, mocking, sarcasm, all the time, putdowns, humility is the opposite of that.

Thirdly, humility is the opposite of willfulness. Edwards says that one of the marks of spiritual pride in churches is he says, spiritually proud people are always absolutely sure of every point of their beliefs. A proud person cannot admit they're wrong. Proud people can't admit they're wrong. They can't take advice. They can't take correction. They don't like repenting if they repent. It's always under duress. They're not teachable. They're not open to advice. They're not willing to change their mind. They don't listen. They're not teachable. So willfulness. So pride is opposite of drivenness, scornfulness, willfulness, and self-consciousness now.

Now think about this with me for a minute. When you and I think of proud people, we almost always think of arrogant people, but that's not the only form of pride. We think of people who are self-remotors and who are bragging all the time, but that's not the only form of pride. Oh no. Because ultimately pride, the opposite of humility, is this insecurity. This need for honor, this need for glory, and that can be as much a manifestation, that can be as manifested as much through an inferiority feeling as a superiority feeling. Because if you're always down on yourself and you're always beating yourself up, or if you're afraid of compliments, you're afraid of any kind of attention, it's because you are just as painfully self-aware. You're just as absorbed in thinking about yourself. You're looking at yourself and wondering, you know, how am I coming across as the person with a superiority complex? So humility is the opposite of self-consciousness.

With Christmas just around the corner, we are inviting people to sign up for our Advent devotional series, which you can receive daily from November 30th to December 24th. The daily meditations will help you take time to think about the meaning and joy that comes from Christ's birth. Each day of Advent, you'll receive a devotional with a meditation on a Bible passage that focuses on why Jesus came into the world to reconcile us to our Heavenly Father. We believe that during this short season, this is a great tool to help you focus on the hope, joy, peace, and love we have through Christ's birth. You can sign up by visiting gospelonlife.com slash Advent. Again, to sign up, go to gospelonlife.com slash Advent. In addition to the daily emails, you'll also receive a video message each Sunday. The weekly video message starts each week of Advent with a meditation from Tim Keller, followed by a brief discussion with Tim and Kathy talking about something they noticed in the meditation. It's our prayer that through this Advent series, you experience the hope and joy that comes from Christ's birth and that it is a source of encouragement to you this Advent season.

Listen, let me press this a little bit on you. In the screw tape letters, there's a devil named screw tape, written by C.S. Lewis, and he is giving advice to his junior devil, nephew, on how to attempt a human being which he calls a patient. Whenever you read something in a sermon out of screw tape letters, you have to turn yourself upside down, because the devil giving advice to another devil about how to attempt a human being. But listen to this, screw tape says, I see your patient has become humble. Have you drawn attention to the fact? Catch him at the moment he's really poor in spirit and smuggle into his mind, I'm being humble. And pride in his own humility will appear.

Now listen to this, abjection and self-hatred can do us such good, us demons, if they keep the man concerned with himself. And self-contempt can be the starting point for a life contemptuous of all other cells and therefore a life filled with gloom, cynicism, and cruelty. So let your patient think of humility, not a self-forgetfulness, but as a low opinion of his own talents and character. And see, that brings us to the text itself, was so brilliant about this text is, he says, I want you to have humility, well, he describes it, what does that mean? Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but to the interests of others. Look at that, he didn't say, hate yourself. Don't have any interests, don't have any goals, don't have any needs, he didn't say that. Humility is what you're looking at. That's the reason why what screw tape is saying and what C.S. Lewis is saying is, true humility is not thinking less of yourself or thinking more of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less. It's not noticing yourself because you're not glory hungry. It's not always worried about how are you looking. It's not being down on yourself, it's not being up on yourself, it's just not talking and thinking about yourself so much.

Did you hear what screw tape said? He says, self-hatred is a wonderful way to get people to be cynical and gloomy and cruel. Because if you don't like yourself then you're not going to like other people and you're going to be very cruel to them. So you see, humility is the opposite of self-consciousness, self-awareness. Real humility is self-forgetfulness. The best way I can illustrate this is your body parts. If you go to work tomorrow and somebody comes in saying, boy my elbows feel great. You're going to say, well the only reason anybody would ever say that is if yesterday their elbows didn't feel great because ordinarily if your elbows are working fine they don't draw attention to themselves. It's somebody saying, oh man my knees are bending so well today. When I sit down they bend, when I stand up they unbend, it's just incredible. You got to figure, it must be that the knees weren't bending. You would never even think about it unless there was something wrong. You don't think of your knees unless there's something wrong with them. You don't think of your elbows unless there's something wrong with them.

Okay now let's look at your ego. Your sense of self, if you were healthy you wouldn't even think about how you're doing and how you're looking, what people are saying about you, you wouldn't even think about it. You wouldn't be looking at yourself or your own interests, you'd be looking, see it other things, looking at God, looking at your neighbor, looking at everybody else. And yet we, that's the truth. You're always thinking about yourself, how are you looking, you're always getting your feelings hurt, you're always getting your feeling insulted. You're feeling snub, you're feeling, you know, or here's a person over there that you want to like you more than really that he or she does. So you're always thinking about yourself, why there's something wrong with your ego, just like if you're ever thinking about your elbow, there's something wrong with your elbow. We're not healthy. We're vain, glorious, we're lacking in glory. And as a result, we're not humble at all. We're filled with drivenness, scornfulness, willfulness and self-consciousness.

### The Cure: The Example of Christ

So what's the cure? Well, I'd like to show you that this passage is giving us a top cure, it speaks broadly middle and practically too. It wasn't until fairly recently, as well as I've known this passage. This is one of the most famous passages in the Bible. If you're a theological student and you're trying to learn what does the Bible teach about Christ, you study this thing, word for word, almost letter for letter. I know I did a long time ago, and it's an amazing, sweeping, magnificent hymn. It's a hymn. Notice why it's laying on the page the way it is, looking like it's inverse because either Paul wrote this this way or else he was quoting somebody else's. But because of its lexical links, its parallelism, its rhythm, this is a hymn, this is a song. It's a hymn of praise to the deity of Jesus Christ, the greatness of who he is and what he's done.

Now, here's what I want to ask, here's the first question, and this is actually the first answer to the cure here. Why would Paul do this? He's talking about something very, very practical, humility and fighting in the church. Very practical. And all of a sudden, he goes into this sweeping theological discourse, why? And here's the reason why. You cannot work on humility directly. It's a byproduct of something else. You can't work on it directly. Do you know what I mean by this? I mean, I've already, do you realize they've already gotten less and less humble as the minutes have gone by here? Don't you know why? In other words, it's impossible to work on it directly. We kind of got that from the screw tape letters there. Real humility is not thinking about yourself, but that's what we're doing.

So for example, okay, you've got this little set of evaluation tools in your head now for a minute. I don't know how long they'll be there, but for a few days, you might remember, drivenness, scorefulness, willfulness, and self-consciousness. Okay, next time you see somebody being score-in-full, next time you see somebody being wilful, what are you going to do, you're going to go? Proud. Not me, I'm not going to do that. The only way you can possibly work on humility is to really lose it, you know why? Because you can't work on humility if humility self-forgetfulness. You can only work on not appearing proud. You can only work on appearances, which is to destroy it. Humility is the shyest of virtues. You can't talk to humility without it going away. It just doesn't want to be there, okay? And therefore you can't work directly on humility. You mustn't try to work directly on humility. Well then what are you supposed to do? You're supposed to look at someone else.

And this isn't just theology, this is a hymn. It's written to be chanted or to be recited or to be sung. And what is Paul saying? Paul saying, the way we're going to fix what is most wrong with us in our center. You've got to see Jesus, you've got to have the theology, you have to biblical doctrine on fire in your heart, something you praise God for, something that captures your imagination. Who Jesus is and what He has done. And it's doctrine on fire, theology on fire in your heart. Humility is a byproduct of wanting something more than to be humble. Because if you want to be humble, it's all about you. It's all about you. If you want to be humble, why would you want to be humble? Except I mean I don't want to look proud or I want to be right or I want to, you know, you've got to want him, you've got to worship him, you've got to see him. Humility is a byproduct of wanting something more than humility. Wanting him first. That's the top, that's the first part of the cure, the second part of the cure though.

This is not just doctrine in general, look at what it is, it's a trajectory. In fact, somebody said that this passage of verses 5 to 11 is actually a symphony in three movements. The first movement is incarnation, though he was God, he became human. The second motion is to atonement, though he was human, he didn't just have a nice comfortable life, but he went to the cross. And the third movement is up. He comes down, he goes even lower, therefore God has highly exalted him. Now what did he do? Here's what he did. This is the heart of it all. Right in the center of this passage, it says, in the very nature God, he did not count equality with God, something to be grasped in verse 7, but made himself nothing.

Now do you know what that word is, the Greek word? Kenosis. Kenosis, does that sound familiar to you? Yes. It says he emptied himself, though he was God, he emptied himself. And the big question that theologians have been asking for about 2,000 years is emptied himself of what? It doesn't say, he just says he emptied himself. And some people have said, oh, of course he was God, so he emptied himself of his deity, he emptied himself of his divinity, but that's not what it says. It never says that he gave up being God, it says he started being a servant. He did not shed his divine nature, he assumed a human nature, and more than that he became not just a king, he became a servant. And there it is. He emptied himself of his glory, not his deity, what? Yeah, listen, in heaven, if you were transported to heaven, then or now? And you saw Jesus as God, his godness manifested itself through an expression of glory, his beauty, his brightness. It would just knock you down. When you see something beautiful, when you see a piece of art or a waterfall or anything, it's just absolutely beautiful, even even earthly things that are beautiful, you've got to adore, right? It's so glorious, it just evokes adoration, but Jesus Christ came without that. Isaiah 53 says, he had no beauty that we should desire him. He emptied himself of his glory, he emptied himself of his beauty, he emptied himself of that which evokes honor. And so he came, and he was lonely, and he was poor, and eventually he was beaten, and he was tortured, and he was killed. He emptied himself of his glory, he became small, not a king at all. He became rejected, he became beatable, and he was beaten, right? He became rejectable, and he was rejected. He lost all of his glory, he came out of his glory, he didn't stop being God, but he emptied himself of his glory. Therefore God has highly exalted him. Why? Why is he resurrected? Why is he up there? Because he saved us. He took our punishment upon himself, so he's redeemed the new humanity, and he's leading us into the future, and so there it is, there's a trajectory. What is a trajectory, everybody? The way up is down. The way to be truly rich is to give away. The way to rule is to serve, and the way to become infinitely happy is to not seek your own happiness, but seek the happiness of others. And the most glorious thing of all, the greatest form of glory is to give away your glory for somebody else.

And now you see the word Kenosis shows up twice, and look at it. You and I are desperately trying to fill ourselves with glory, but we end up empty. But Jesus Christ who had true glory emptied himself, so we could be full, full, yes. Because Jesus Christ became small, we are big in the eyes of the Father. Because Jesus Christ lost all of his glory, we are now given His righteousness and His record. This is what the gospel is. That Jesus Christ was treated the way we deserve, so now when we believe in Him we are treated as He deserves to be treated. And you know what this means? Jesus Christ looks at you and says, to me and in me, you are more precious than all the jewels that lie beneath the earth. To the degree you know that and believe that. To the degree you are gripped and you are praising God and you're singing about Jesus trajectory for you, you will be able to walk that same trajectory here. Because you will know the way up is down. The way to be rich is to give away. The way to be happy is not to seek your own happiness, but the happiness of others. And when you say that He did that for you, that fills you up so you're not empty anymore and you'll be able to not have to think about yourself and how you go.

Let me give you just one practical thing on this. I've already told you that it will sense you can't work on your humility, but you can work on your pride. Here's what I remember. This King James version, the King James version of Philippians 2.7 is, he made himself of no reputation. And I remember some years ago, one of the humblest men I've ever worked with was a pastor on our staff named Dick Kaufman, he was here in the 90s. And I always wanted to know, you can't say to a humble person, what is the secret of your humility? Because if they answer, you'd have to go find somebody else. And you've ruined them right there. And I was like, oh, well, thank you. Yeah, let me think about it. I guess it must be, no, you don't want that. You don't want that at all. But I do remember one day, he confessed to me that there are two things that he couldn't stand, hardly. One is when he didn't do his best. And the other was when he got real sharp unfair criticism. You know, he said, if I get good criticism, okay, if I get unfair criticism, or if I feel like I didn't do my best, I said, so why does that bother you so much? He says, because there's nothing more important to me, unfortunately, than my reputation. There's nothing more important to me than my reputation. It means everything to me. If I think anything is hurting my reputation, then I just start to fall apart. And he says, but here's what I've learned to do, and it's really helped. I meditate on Philippians 2.7. I realize Jesus made Himself of no reputation. He lost His reputation for me. And if His reputation didn't mean anything for Him, if He gave it up for me, then I can give it up for Him. Do you know how to do that? Is there a place in your life? Is there a spot in your prayer life? Is there a place where you regularly hear Jesus say, in me and to me, you are more precious than all the jewels that lie beneath the earth? So why the heck do you care if somebody snubbed you? How do you mind what you look like there? Who cares about your reputation? When you know that I love you like this? Is there a place where something like that happens in the depths of your soul? See, that's how you develop humility, not by looking at yourself, but by looking at Him.

I heard a story some years ago about a young man who went into a little British town to climb the mountain right behind the town, and they all said, oh, no, look, it's higher than you think. It's the weather's worse than you think, but he was sort of overconfident, and he didn't go up with a appropriate gear, and he thought he knew what he was doing. So he walked out of the village one morning to go up the mountain with his head held high, and several hours he came back crestfallen, he hadn't even gotten halfway up, and it was an old lady who saw him come back in and said, son, if you'd gone up the way you came down, you would have come down the way you went up, which is another way of saying, humble yourself under the mighty hand of God, and he will exalt you in due time.

Let's pray. Father, we thank you for this, the gift of humility, which is not something that we ever get if we ask for it, look for it, see whether we've got it or not, it's a shy virtue. But we know this, that if we look at you, and we look at your humility, and we look at what you've done for us, and we just look at it and look at it and look at it until it catches fire in our hearts until it moves us to tears, it's going to change us. We will not be as marked by drivenness and squirtfulness and willfulness in self-consciousness. So we pray that you would make us, like your son, who came not to be served but to serve and give his life a ransom for many. Jesus and we pray, amen.

### 引言：谦卑的挑战

欢迎来到《福音生活》！我们中的许多人试图通过纯粹的意志力来改变，征服坏习惯或强迫更好的行为，结果却发现自己又回到了旧的模式。在今天的信息中，Tim Keller 探讨了圣灵的果实，展示了真正的转变不是关于道德约束，而是通过基督从内到外改变的心。今晚的经文来自腓立比书第二章，1-11 节。

> “所以在基督里若有什么劝勉，爱心有什么安慰，圣灵有什么交通，心中有什么慈悲怜悯，你们就要意念相同，爱心相同，有一样的心思，有一样的意念。凡事不可结党，不可贪图虚浮的荣耀，只要存心谦卑，各人看别人比自己强。各人不要单顾自己的事，也要顾别人的事。你们当以基督耶稣的心为心：他本有神的形象，不以自己与神同等为强夺的，反倒虚己，取了奴仆的形象，成为人的样式；既有人的样子，就自己卑微，存心顺服，以至于死，且死在十字架上。所以神将他升为至高，又赐给他那超乎万名之上的名，叫一切在天上的、地上的和地底下的，因耶稣的名无不屈膝，无不口称耶稣基督为主，使荣耀归与父神。”

这是神的话。这是一个关于谦卑的伟大段落。

### 病症：骄傲与荣耀的空虚

当我们在过去几个月谈论正义和穷人时，我总是感觉到，即使这很重要，这是圣经所说的，我们有文化的窗口或后盾。你知道我的意思吗？文化说，很好，我们真的很高兴你们基督徒在思考这些。我们也对此感兴趣。所以你有你的窗口在后面。但当你谈到这个主题，这个主题是谦卑，当你谈到圣经关于谦卑的说法时，我们有文化的窗口在我们面前。

现代人，尤其是现代纽约人，盯着圣经的谦卑概念，就像牛盯着新门一样。最近一位文化趋势评论员说，谦卑在过去几十年中在我们的社会中受到了攻击。自我贬低已被视为顺从和自我压抑。另一种被社会学家称为表现性个人主义的精神浮现出来。现在在我们的社会中，救赎是通过与自我的亲密接触以及揭示内在的美丽、力量，甚至神性来实现的。

所以这就是我们的文化的方法，这完全与这段经文和圣经关于谦卑重要性的说法相悖。让我们注意三件事，这段宏伟的经文，我们可以轻松地做 30 周的讲道，只是这段经文，但我们不会。相反，我会给你一个顶级的看法，这将告诉我们关于我们有的病症，关于我们如果健康会是什么样子，以及如何获得治疗。病症，健康的图景，和治疗。

**现在病症是，在第二和第三节中找到。他说，要同心合意，爱心相同，有一样的心思，有一样的意念。现在他描述的是一个统一的人类社区，这是我们都想要的。** 我们都想生活在一个没有争斗和分裂的社区中，但有爱和精神的合一，心思的合一，好吧，相反，我们在时代广场有炸弹和政治极化和战争，你说但这实际上是在谈论教会，对吧，这就是重点，重点是人类的心有问题，甚至在像教会这样的团体内部，每个人都分享同样的信仰，仍然有不断的争斗。

保罗提到这一点的原因是，如果你读完这封短信的结尾，你会知道，教会中有几个关键人物之间正在发生争执。教会充满了争斗和分裂，就像世界其他地方一样，为什么？因为心有问题。那是什么？好吧，他提到了。他说，如果你要有合一，因此不要出于私心或虚荣心。现在，私心不是一个特别启发性的短语，它实际上只是意味着分裂的精神，这就是我们知道的问题，但第二个短语是至关重要的。

我们出于私心做事的原因，或者我们总是争斗的原因是因为他所说的，这个翻译称为虚荣心，但它是一个希腊词，quinoidoxias，quino 意味着空，canosis，意味着自我空，doxa 意味着荣耀和尊重。被 quinoidoxia 特征化意味着什么？这意味着荣耀空虚，渴望荣誉，渴望尊重，渴望那种保证，因为你不觉得自己是一个重要的人。

**这是激进的，宇宙的不安全感。这是感觉我不重要，我不重要，我是一个波浪在沙滩上。我需要保证我没事，我很重要，我算数，你知道，渴望尊重和荣耀和荣誉。这是人类的灵魂。更好的是。被憎恨和攻击比被忽视要好。** 记得在电影或戏剧《阿玛迪斯》的结尾，为什么年迈的萨利埃里处于一种活生生的地狱中？因为随着这位作曲家变老，他不是不受欢迎，而是被遗忘了。因为他被遗忘了，那就是地狱。被绝对和最终地忽视和忽略。

现在你明白为什么荣耀空虚，感觉我不重要，我不算数，会导致分裂。我是说，你可以在街头帮派中看到这一点。街头帮派是什么？它们充满了通常不被社会重视的年轻人，往往不被家庭重视或爱护，因此他们走在街上，如果你稍微轻视他们，他们会对你拔枪。因为他们是荣耀空虚的。因为他们不觉得重要，他们争斗。你说，好吧，当然，这很容易看到，因为，你知道，是的，那是他们。他们自尊心低，等等。是的，我知道，除了如果你读历史，如果你只是读历史，你会知道国家一直像街头帮派一样行事，你知道，稍微轻视他们，他们就会开战。因为这是我们集体的样子，这是我们集体的样子。

为什么？为什么我们是这样的？好吧，想想圣经怎么说，我不知道有更好的诊断。圣经说我们最初是为了永远活着而被创造的。但因为我们背离了神，现在我们正在消逝。我们知道。我们被创造为永不被遗忘。我们被创造为站在神的面前并获得他的恩宠。我们被创造为持久。但因为我们背离了神，我们知道我们正在死去。我们知道我们正在消逝。我们知道我们将被遗忘。我们不觉得真实。我们觉得自己是沙滩上的波浪。我们觉得自己是手中的月光，等等。因此，我们拼命地寻找每一个可能的人，让他们说你很好，你很重要，你很有价值，你知道，你永远不会被遗忘。你是如此重要，我们只是绝望，这就是我们争斗的原因。

基督教作家刘易斯·米德斯说了关于骄傲的这句话，因为我们在谈论的，这种对荣耀的渴望就是骄傲。他说，骄傲在精神上，是拒绝让神成为神。是抓住神的地位为自己。是希望成为创造者，独立，依赖于自己的资源。这是最大的幻想，所有幻想中的幻想，宇宙的骗局，幻想我们可以成为我们自己的神，这就是每个人所在的地方，让我们在中心空虚，你听到了吗？让我们在中心空虚，因此我们学会了摇摆。我们被恐惧和焦虑的恶魔攻击，所以我们虚张声势。我们环顾四周，每当我们看到一个新人时，我们就用人作为骄傲创造的摇摇欲坠的自我的支撑，每次你遇到一个新人，你都在无意识地想，这个人如何能满足我证明我算数的需要？因此，生活成为了一场不断的战斗，利用人来支持自己的自我。

所以这就是病症，骄傲，这是一种对荣耀的渴望，一种对尊重的需要，一种对我们真实的保证的需要。

### 健康的图景：真正的谦卑

那么健康的样子是什么？如果我们没有这个，健康的样子是什么？答案很有趣。它都总结在谦卑这个词中，因为继续下去。他在第二节中说，我希望你们合一。第三节的第一部分说，而你们不合一的原因是因为这种空虚，这种虚荣，这就是《钦定版圣经》所说的，这翻译得更好，空虚，你知道，缺乏荣耀。因为你的空虚，因为你的骄傲，因此，他说，从第3B节开始，谦卑地看别人比自己强。各人不要单顾自己的事，也要顾别人的事。

这告诉了你很多，但让我，首先让我们看看谦卑这个词。它是什么？这是一个简单的希腊词，意思是温柔，谦逊，谦让，温柔，谦逊，谦让他人。在新约之外，这个希腊词，无论何时在任何其他类型的古希腊文学中使用，总是带有贬义，因为在希腊罗马社会中，谦让和温柔和谦逊，是奴隶的态度。看，那古老的社会重视力量，他们相信实际上社会稳定是基于恐惧的。人们尊重你，他们以尊重的态度对待你，然后社会就会团结在一起，而尊重的唯一方式是人们害怕你，温柔和谦让和谦逊。那是给奴隶的，而这个词在圣经中，或它的版本，被使用了270次，几乎总是积极的。

你意识到这在西方文化中是多么大的世界观革命，谦卑，只有基督教出现。如果你回去看看希腊人，看看亚里士多德和柏拉图，看看他们对美德的所有强调，你永远不会在其中看到谦卑。然而，你知道谦卑在圣经中有多重要吗？这不仅仅是重要。我想让你想一想。当耶稣说温柔的人，谦卑的人将承受地球。当耶稣说，负我的轭，学我的样，因为我心里柔和谦卑，你们就必得享安息。他在说什么？

好吧，想想福音一会儿。如果你来到神面前说，我想与你建立关系，看看我所有的成就，看看我做了什么。他会拒绝你说，你不知道我是谁，你不知道你是谁，你不知道耶稣基督的十字架意味着什么。但如果你来并说，哦主啊，我悔改，我需要你的恩典，我没有什么可以赢得你的恩宠，但我请求你因耶稣的缘故拯救我，那就是悔改和信仰，你是因恩典得救，你是通过信仰得救。但你知道那是什么吗？那是谦卑。唯一能杀死你，唯一能永远毁灭你的东西就是缺乏谦卑。你可以缺乏几乎任何其他东西，但不能缺乏这个，因为这就是将你与神连接起来的东西。

事实上，如果你想想，基本上神的救赎计划是提升谦卑的人。他在路加福音1章中这样说。他的救赎计划是提升谦卑的人。你看到它有多重要。好吧，它是什么？实际上保罗给出了一个相当好的顶级答案，但让我，因为这个系列的一个优势是给人们提供自我评估的工具，让我带你去看看乔纳森·爱德华兹。他是，他花了大量时间，是一位基督教牧师，花了大量时间思考属灵成长和真正的基督教，并在几个不同的地方，他花了相当多的时间处理圣经说谦卑是什么的问题。我总结了他所说的骄傲的四件事，因此反对谦卑的四件事，这实际上是我看待自己生活和思考自己的相当好的方法。

他说骄傲反对三四件事，原谅我，骄傲是四件事，谦卑因此反对这四件事。幸福，轻蔑，固执和自我意识。好吧，和我一起想一想。首先，谦卑反对驱动力。小心。非常有可能因为你热爱你所追求的东西而充满激情和努力工作并渴望卓越。如果你在艺术或音乐中追求卓越，如果你在商业或教育或你的学术领域中追求卓越，可能是因为你实际上热爱这个领域。可能是，例如，你只是喜欢跑步，你喜欢看人跑步，你只是喜欢它的运动性，如果这就是你作为运动员跑步并试图跑得越来越快的原因，如果你的竞争力是由快乐驱动的竞争力，那么如果你的朋友打破了纪录，你几乎会和你一样快乐。

但这通常不是它的工作方式，是吗？因为我们的竞争力不是由快乐驱动的，而是由内在的真空驱动的。这就是为什么C.S.刘易斯在他的书《基督教》中有一个很棒的地方，他说，骄傲，真正的骄傲，从拥有某物中得不到快乐。骄傲只从拥有比下一个人更多的东西中得到快乐。你可能认为你为成功或聪明或好看而骄傲，但当你被那些与你平等或比你更好的人包围时，你在这些事情上失去了所有的快乐。是比较让你骄傲。是高于其他人的快乐。这完全正确。

所以首先，乔纳森·爱德华兹说，这就是你如何判断你是否是一个骄傲的人。你被驱动。你需要成功。你总是不满意……你没有做得那么好，你没有做对。你可以做得更好。你被驱动。你不安，但谦卑对环境感到满足，对不完美感到满足。谦卑是驱动力的反面。想想这个。

其次，谦卑是轻蔑的反面。顺便说一句，有时你可以讽刺，尤其是关于一个非常非常错误的事情，你可能想用讽刺来可能表达你的观点。但总的来说，正如我认为爱德华兹正确地说，他说，以蔑视的态度对待他人，嘲笑，嘲弄总是骄傲的表现。为什么？因为你在贬低人。这就是我们……这就是我们使用的隐喻。你在贬低人，所以你可以高于他们。相反，谦卑意味着始终以礼貌、恩典和亲切对待那些比你低或反对你的人。所以你看到骄傲的一种方式是驱动力，谦卑是它的反面。你看到骄傲的一种方式是轻蔑，嘲笑，讽刺，所有的时间，贬低，谦卑是它的反面。

第三，谦卑是固执的反面。爱德华兹说，教会中属灵骄傲的一个标志是他说，属灵骄傲的人总是对他们信仰的每一点都绝对确定。骄傲的人不能承认他们错了。骄傲的人不能承认他们错了。他们不能接受建议。他们不能接受纠正。他们不喜欢悔改，如果他们悔改。总是在压力下。他们不容易教。他们不愿意接受建议。他们不愿意改变主意。他们不听。他们不容易教。所以固执。所以骄傲是驱动力、轻蔑、固执和自我意识的反面。

现在和我一起想一想。当你和我想到骄傲的人时，我们几乎总是想到傲慢的人，但这不是骄傲的唯一形式。我们想到那些自我推销和总是吹嘘的人，但这不是骄傲的唯一形式。哦，不。因为最终骄傲，谦卑的反面，是这种不安全感。这种对荣誉的需要，这种对荣耀的需要，这可以是同样的表现，这可以通过自卑感和优越感同样表现出来。因为如果你总是对自己感到失望，总是打击自己，或者如果你害怕赞美，害怕任何形式的关注，那是因为你同样痛苦地自我意识。你同样沉浸在思考自己。你在看自己，想知道，你知道，我是如何表现的，作为一个有优越感的人。所以谦卑是自我意识的反面。

随着圣诞节的临近，我们邀请人们注册我们的降临节灵修系列，你可以从11月30日到12月24日每天收到。每日的冥想将帮助你花时间思考基督诞生带来的意义和快乐。降临节的每一天，你都会收到一个灵修，其中有一个关于圣经经文的冥想，重点是耶稣为什么来到世上与我们的天父和好。我们相信在这个短暂的季节中，这是一个很好的工具，帮助你专注于通过基督的诞生我们所拥有的希望、快乐、和平和爱。你可以通过访问gospelonlife.com/advent注册。再次注册，请访问gospelonlife.com/advent。除了每日电子邮件，你还将在每个星期天收到一个视频信息。每周的视频信息以Tim Keller的冥想开始每周的降临节，然后是Tim和Kathy的简短讨论，谈论他们在冥想中注意到的事情。我们祈祷通过这个降临节系列，你体验到基督诞生带来的希望和快乐，并且在这个降临节季节中成为你的鼓励来源。

听着，让我在这上面给你一点压力。在《魔鬼书信》中，有一个名叫Screwtape的魔鬼，由C.S.刘易斯写的，他正在给他的初级魔鬼侄子建议，如何尝试一个他称为病人的人类。当你在讲道中读到《魔鬼书信》中的东西时，你必须把自己倒过来，因为魔鬼在给另一个魔鬼建议如何尝试一个人类。但听这个，Screwtape说，我看到你的病人变得谦卑。你有没有注意到这一点？在他真正贫穷的时候抓住他，并偷偷地进入他的脑海，我正在变得谦卑。然后对自己谦卑的骄傲就会出现。

现在听这个，卑鄙和自我仇恨可以对我们这些恶魔有很大的好处，如果它们让这个人关注自己。而自我蔑视可以成为对所有其他自我的蔑视生活的起点，因此是充满阴郁、愤世嫉俗和残酷的生活。所以让你的病人认为谦卑，不是自我遗忘，而是对自己才能和性格的低评价。你看，这让我们回到了文本本身，这段文本的精彩之处在于，他说，我希望你有谦卑，好吧，他描述了它，那是什么意思？你们每个人都应该不仅关注自己的利益，还要关注他人的利益。看看这个，他没有说，恨自己。没有任何兴趣，没有任何目标，没有任何需要，他没有说那个。谦卑是你在看的东西。这就是为什么Screwtape所说的和C.S.刘易斯所说的是真正的谦卑不是少想自己或多想自己，而是少想自己。不是注意自己，因为你不渴望荣耀。不是总是担心你看起来怎么样。不是对自己感到失望，不是对自己感到满意，只是不那么多地谈论和思考自己。

你听到Screwtape说了什么吗？他说，自我仇恨是让人们变得愤世嫉俗、阴郁和残酷的绝妙方法。因为如果你不喜欢自己，那么你就不会喜欢其他人，你会对他们非常残酷。所以你看，谦卑是自我意识、自我意识的反面。真正的谦卑是自我遗忘。我能最好地说明这一点的是你的身体部位。如果你明天去上班，有人进来说，哇，我的肘部感觉很好。你会说，唯一一个人会说这个的原因是如果昨天他们的肘部感觉不好，因为通常如果你的肘部工作正常，它们不会引起注意。有人说，哦，天哪，我的膝盖今天弯得很好。当我坐下时，它们弯曲，当我站起来时，它们不弯曲，真是不可思议。你得想，膝盖一定是不弯曲的。除非有什么问题，否则你永远不会想到它。除非有什么问题，否则你不会想到你的膝盖。除非有什么问题，否则你不会想到你的肘部。

好吧，现在让我们看看你的自我。你的自我意识，如果你是健康的，你甚至不会想到你做得怎么样，你看起来怎么样，人们在说什么，你甚至不会想到它。你不会看自己或自己的利益，你会看，看到其他东西，看神，看你的邻居，看其他人。然而我们，这就是事实。你总是想着自己，你看起来怎么样，你总是感到受伤，你总是感到被侮辱。你感到被冷落，你感到，你知道，或者这里有一个人，你希望他或她比实际上更喜欢你。所以你总是想着自己，为什么你的自我有问题，就像如果你总是想着你的肘部，你的肘部有问题。我们不健康。我们虚荣，我们缺乏荣耀。因此，我们根本不谦卑。我们充满了驱动力、轻蔑、固执和自我意识。

### 治疗：基督的榜样

那么治疗是什么？好吧，我想向你展示这段经文给了我们一个顶级的治疗，它广泛地、中等地和实际地说。直到最近，我才知道这段经文。这是圣经中最著名的经文之一。如果你是一个神学学生，你试图学习圣经关于基督的教导，你会逐字逐句地研究这个东西，几乎逐字逐句。我很久以前就知道了，这是一个惊人的、宏伟的、宏伟的赞美诗。这是一首赞美诗。注意为什么它在页面上看起来像是诗句，因为保罗要么是这样写的，要么是引用了别人的。但由于它的词汇链接、平行性、节奏，这是一个赞美诗，这是一首歌。这是一首赞美耶稣基督的神性，他的伟大和他所做的事情的赞美诗。

现在，这就是我想问的，这实际上是治疗的第一个答案。为什么保罗会这样做？他在谈论一些非常非常实际的事情，教会中的谦卑和争斗。非常实际。突然之间，他进入了这个宏伟的神学论述，为什么？这就是原因。你不能直接在谦卑上工作。它是其他东西的副产品。你不能直接在它上工作。你知道我的意思吗？我的意思是，我已经，你意识到他们已经变得越来越不谦卑了吗？你知道为什么吗？换句话说，直接在它上工作是不可能的。我们从《魔鬼书信》中得到了这个。真正的谦卑不是想着自己，但这就是我们正在做的。

所以例如，好吧，你现在有一个小的评估工具集在你的脑海中。我不知道它们会在那里多久，但几天后，你可能会记得，驱动力、轻蔑、固执和自我意识。好吧，下次你看到有人轻蔑，下次你看到有人固执，你会怎么做，你会去吗？骄傲。不是我，我不会那样做。你唯一可能在谦卑上工作的方式是失去它，你知道为什么吗？因为如果谦卑是自我遗忘，你就不能在谦卑上工作。你只能在不显得骄傲上工作。你只能在外表上工作，这就是摧毁它。谦卑是最害羞的美德。你不能和谦卑说话而不让它消失。它就是不想在那里，好吗？因此你不能直接在谦卑上工作。你不应该直接在谦卑上工作。那么你应该做什么？你应该看别人。

这不仅仅是神学，这是一个赞美诗。它被写成可以吟唱或背诵或唱的。保罗在说什么？保罗在说，我们要修复我们中心最错误的东西。你必须看到耶稣，你必须有神学，你必须在心中有燃烧的圣经教义，某种你赞美神的东西，某种捕捉你想象力的东西。耶稣是谁，他做了什么。它是燃烧的教义，燃烧的神学在你的心中。谦卑是想要比谦卑更多的东西的副产品。因为如果你想要谦卑，那就是关于你的。那就是关于你的。如果你想要谦卑，为什么你想要谦卑？除了我不想显得骄傲，或者我想要正确，或者我想要，你知道，你必须想要他，你必须崇拜他，你必须看到他。谦卑是想要比谦卑更多的东西的副产品。首先想要他。这是治疗的顶级，这是治疗的第一部分，然而治疗的第二部分。

这不仅仅是一般的教义，看看它是什么，它是一个轨迹。事实上，有人说这段经文的5到11节实际上是一个三乐章的交响曲。第一乐章是道成肉身，虽然他是神，他成为人。第二乐章是赎罪，虽然他是人，他不仅仅过着舒适的生活，而是去了十字架。第三乐章是向上。他下来，他甚至更低，因此神高度提升了他。现在他做了什么？这是他所做的一切的核心。在这段经文的中心，它说，在神的本性中，他没有将与神同等视为强夺的东西，在第7节中，而是使自己成为无有。

现在你知道那个词是什么，希腊词吗？Kenosis。Kenosis，这对你来说熟悉吗？是的。它说他使自己成为无有，虽然他是神，他使自己成为无有。神学家们已经问了大约2000年的大问题是他使自己成为无有什么？它没有说，他只是说他使自己成为无有。有些人说，哦，当然他是神，所以他使自己成为无有他的神性，他使自己成为无有他的神性，但这不是它所说的。它从未说过他放弃了成为神，它说他开始成为一个仆人。他没有放弃他的神性，他承担了一个人性，更重要的是他不仅成为一个国王，他成为一个仆人。就是这样。他使自己成为无有他的荣耀，而不是他的神性，什么？是的，听着，在天堂，如果你被传送到天堂，那时或现在？你看到耶稣作为神，他的神性通过荣耀的表现表现出来，他的美丽，他的光辉。它会让你震惊。当你看到美丽的东西时，当你看到一件艺术品或瀑布或任何东西时，它是绝对美丽的，甚至是地球上美丽的东西，你必须崇拜，对吧？它是如此荣耀，它只是唤起崇拜，但耶稣基督来了，没有那个。以赛亚书53章说，他没有美丽让我们渴望他。他使自己成为无有他的荣耀，他使自己成为无有他的美丽，他使自己成为无有那些唤起荣誉的东西。因此他来了，他是孤独的，他是贫穷的，最终他被殴打，他被折磨，他被杀。他使自己成为无有他的荣耀，他变得渺小，根本不是一个国王。他变得被拒绝，他变得可打败，他被打败，对吗？他变得可拒绝，他被拒绝。他失去了所有的荣耀，他走出了他的荣耀，他没有停止成为神，但他使自己成为无有他的荣耀。因此神高度提升了他。为什么？为什么他复活了？为什么他在那里？因为他拯救了我们。他把我们的惩罚放在自己身上，所以他赎回了新人类，他带领我们走向未来，因此这就是轨迹。轨迹是什么，大家？向上的路是向下的。真正富有的方式是给予。统治的方式是服务，变得无限快乐的方式不是追求自己的快乐，而是追求他人的快乐。最荣耀的事情，所有荣耀的最高形式是为别人放弃你的荣耀。

现在你看到Kenosis这个词出现了两次，看看它。你和我拼命地试图用荣耀填满自己，但我们最终是空的。但耶稣基督拥有真正的荣耀使自己成为无有，所以我们可以充满，充满，是的。因为耶稣基督变得渺小，我们在父的眼中是伟大的。因为耶稣基督失去了所有的荣耀，我们现在被赋予了他的公义和他的记录。这就是福音。耶稣基督被以我们应得的方式对待，所以现在当我们相信他时，我们被以他应得的方式对待。你知道这意味着什么吗？耶稣基督看着你说，对我来说，在我里面，你比地球下的所有珠宝都更珍贵。你知道并相信的程度。你被抓住并赞美神的程度，你在为耶稣的轨迹唱歌，你将能够在这里走同样的轨迹。因为你会知道向上的路是向下的。富有的方式是给予。快乐的方式不是追求自己的快乐，而是追求他人的快乐。当你说他为你做了这些，那会填满你，所以你不再空虚，你将能够不必想着自己和你的去向。

让我给你一个关于这个的实际建议。我已经告诉过你，因为你不能在谦卑上工作，但你可以在骄傲上工作。这是我记得的。钦定版圣经，腓立比书2:7的钦定版是，他使自己成为无有。我记得几年前，我曾与之共事过的最谦卑的人之一是我们教会的牧师，名叫迪克·考夫曼，他在90年代在这里。我总是想知道，你不能对一个谦卑的人说，你的谦卑秘诀是什么？因为如果他们回答，你就得去找别人。你就在那时毁了他们。我就像，哦，好吧，谢谢。是的，让我想一想。我想这一定是，不，你不想要那个。你根本不想要那个。但我确实记得有一天，他向我承认，有两件事他几乎无法忍受。一是当他没有做到最好时。另一个是当他受到真正尖锐的不公平批评时。你知道，他说，如果我得到好的批评，好的，如果我得到不公平的批评，或者如果我觉得我没有做到最好，我说，那为什么这让你如此困扰？他说，因为对我来说，不幸的是，最重要的事情是我的声誉。对我来说，没有什么比我的声誉更重要。这对我来说意味着一切。如果我认为有什么东西在伤害我的声誉，那么我就开始崩溃。他说，但这是我学会做的事情，它真的帮助了我。我默想腓立比书2:7。我意识到耶稣使自己成为无有。他为我失去了他的声誉。如果他的声誉对他来说没有任何意义，如果他为我放弃了它，那么我可以为他放弃它。你知道怎么做吗？在你的生活中有一个地方吗？在你的祷告生活中有一个地方吗？有一个地方你经常听到耶稣说，在我里面，对我来说，你比地球下的所有珠宝都更珍贵？所以为什么你在乎如果有人冷落了你？你在乎你在那里看起来怎么样？谁在乎你的声誉？当你知道我这样爱你时？在你的灵魂深处有一个地方发生这样的事情吗？看，这就是你如何培养谦卑，不是通过看自己，而是通过看他。

几年前我听到一个故事，关于一个年轻人，他进入一个小英国小镇，去爬山就在镇后面，他们都说，哦，不，看，它比你想象的要高。天气比你想象的要糟糕，但他有点过于自信，他没有带合适的装备，他以为他知道自己在做什么。所以他在一个早晨走出村庄去爬山，头高昂，几个小时后他沮丧地回来，他甚至没有走到一半，是一个老妇人看到他回来并说，儿子，如果你以你下来的方式上去，你就会以你上去的方式下来，这就是另一种说法，在神的大能手下谦卑自己，他会在适当的时候提升你。

让我们祷告。父啊，我们感谢你赐予我们谦卑的礼物，这不是我们如果要求它，寻找它，看看我们是否得到了它就能得到的东西，这是一种害羞的美德。但我们知道，如果我们看着你，我们看着你的谦卑，我们看着你为我们所做的，我们只是看着它，看着它，看着它，直到它在我们心中燃烧，直到它感动我们流泪，它会改变我们。我们不会被驱动力、轻蔑、固执和自我意识所标记。因此我们祈祷你会使我们像你的儿子，他来不是要受服侍，而是要服侍，并为多人舍命作赎价。耶稣，我们祈祷，阿门。
