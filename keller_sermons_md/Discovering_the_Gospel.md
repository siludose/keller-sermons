### Introduction: The Importance of Public Faith

How do we share what it means to truly know Jesus? Not just as a historical figure or moral teacher, but as Savior and King. This month, Tim Keller explores what the Bible shows us about being public with our faith and sharing the hope we have in Christ.

The reading this morning is taken from the Book of One Corinthians, chapter 15, verses 1 through 11.

> "Now, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel I preach to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand. By this gospel, you are saved if you hold firmly to the word I preach to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain."

**For what I received, I passed on to you as of first importance that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He appeared to seephus, and then to the 12.**

### Core Beliefs of Christianity

So we're looking at, for a number of weeks, the subject of public faith. What does it mean to talk about your deepest beliefs, who you are, with others in public, who may not share your beliefs, and how do you do that in a way that's transparent, that's honest. The same time is respectful. It promotes peace.

### The Gospel is About Jesus

The gospel is about Jesus. It's about sin and substitution. It's about history and resurrection. And it's about astonishing, transforming grace.

#### 1. Jesus

The gospel is Christ, actually. The gospel is Jesus Christ. Now, how would that be? Well, the word gospel, though many people understand the word gospel means joyful news. That's what the Greek word technically means.

### Sin and Substitution

#### 1. Sin

The first thing that we're told about what Jesus came to do is deal with sin. We are uninformed and we need wisdom. Yes. We are sufferers and we need help. We need support. We need relief. Yes. But, what we're learning here is, first of all, we're sinners needing salvation.

#### 2. Substitution

This little word "for" is not very revealing to us because our English word "for" covers such an enormous range of meanings. You have to have to sit and think and reflect before you know in what way something is for something else.

### History and Resurrection

#### 1. Resurrection

Why does the resurrection of Jesus Christ play an important role in the Gospel? It plays an important role because it's crucial to both, it's crucial in that the resurrection of Jesus usures and secures our past and our future salvation.

### Astonishing, Transforming Grace

The gospel is about grace, grace, grace. The reason my Lloyd Jones could use that diagnostic question and say to people, are you a Christian? And if they said, well, I'm trying, trying very hard, the reason he knew that they didn't understand the core of Christianity was because they didn't understand grace.

> "But by the grace of God, I am what I am, and His grace to me was not without effect."

**Grace does not mean, okay, well, you're just accepted. That's all there is to it, doesn't change you, of course it changes you.**

### 引言：公共信仰的重要性

我们如何分享真正认识耶稣的意义？不仅仅是作为一个历史人物或道德教师，而是作为救主和君王。本月，Tim Keller 探讨了圣经如何展示我们在公共场合表达信仰并分享我们在基督里的希望。

今天早上的读经取自哥林多前书第十五章，第一到十一节。

> "弟兄姐妹们，我要提醒你们我传给你们的福音，就是你们接受的，并且在其上站立得住的福音。你们若持守我传给你们的道，就必因这福音得救，不然你们就是徒然相信。"

**我从前所领受又传给你们的，第一就是基督照圣经所说为我们的罪死了，埋葬了，又照圣经所说第三天复活了，并且显给矶法看，然后显给十二使徒看。**

### 基督教的核心信仰

我们正在研究公共信仰的主题。什么是与他人公开谈论你最深的信仰，谈论你是谁，并且如何以一种透明、诚实的方式做到这一点。同时要尊重，促进和平。

### 福音是关于耶稣的

福音是关于耶稣的。它关于罪与替代，关于历史与复活，以及关于惊人的、改变生命的恩典。

#### 1. 耶稣

实际上，福音就是基督。福音就是耶稣基督。那么，这怎么可能呢？许多人理解福音这个词的意思是快乐的消息。这是希腊词的技术含义。

### 罪与替代

#### 1. 罪

我们首先被告知耶稣来做的事情是处理罪。我们缺乏信息，需要智慧。是的。我们是受苦者，需要帮助、支持和救济。是的。但是，我们在这里学到的是，首先，我们是需要拯救的罪人。

#### 2. 替代

这个小词“为”对我们来说并不太显眼，因为我们的英语词“为”涵盖了如此广泛的意义范围。你必须坐下来思考和反思，才能知道某物以何种方式为某物。

### 历史与复活

#### 1. 复活

为什么耶稣基督的复活在福音中扮演重要角色？它扮演重要角色，因为它对我们的过去和未来的救赎都至关重要。

### 惊人的、改变生命的恩典

福音是关于恩典，恩典，恩典。Lloyd Jones 能够使用那个诊断性问题并对人们说，你是基督徒吗？如果他们说，我正在努力，非常努力，他知道他们不理解基督教的核心，因为他们不理解恩典。

> "然而，我今日成了何等人，是蒙神的恩才成的，并且他所赐我的恩不是徒然的。"

**恩典并不意味着，好吧，你只是被接受了。这就是全部，当然它会改变你。**
