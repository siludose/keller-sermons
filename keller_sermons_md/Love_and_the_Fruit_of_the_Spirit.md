### Introduction: The Challenge of Change

Many of us try to change through sheer willpower, conquering bad habits or forcing better behavior, only to find ourselves snapping back to old patterns. In today's message, Tim Keller is exploring the fruit of the Spirit, showing how real transformation isn't about moral restraint, but a heart that through Christ is changed from the inside out.

The Scripture reading for today is taken from the Book of 1 Corinthians chapter 13, verses 1 through 13.

> "If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging symbol. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains but have not love, I am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing. Love is patient, love is kind, it does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud, it is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails, but where there are prophecies, they will cease, where there are tongues, they will be stilled, where there is knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears. When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me. Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror, then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part, then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. And now these three remain, faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love."

This is the word of the Lord.

Now when you hear that read, you immediately look for the bridesmaids, the flower girl. And you know even though it is a great passage for a wedding, especially the center of that text when it describes love, you could not have a better guide for how to conduct a marriage than that. So it is fine to do that, but I want you to know right now Paul did not write this for weddings. He wrote this about change.

### The Nature of a Supernaturally Changed Heart

Almost all of us have parts of our lives we really want to see changed. But change is really hard. If you take a coke can and you crush it with your hand so that now it is taking up less space, it is smaller. And you take your hand away, it stays where you put it. But if you take a rubber ball and squeeze it with your hand so it takes up less space, then you take your hand away, it snaps right back to where it was. Why? Because the rubber ball, you restrained it temporarily, but you did not really change it.

**You changed the coke can, but you did not really change the rubber ball. You just restrained it and it snaps back.**

Now almost all of us have that experience, the rubber ball experience, I mean, we go out to try to change parts of our lives and we put a lot of willpower behind it. And we put a lot of pressure on certain parts of our lives. We say I think I got it. And then as soon as you let up, or circumstances change, it snaps right back. And this is also true of Christians.

That's the message of this passage. In Galatians chapter 5, Paul lists nine, what he calls fruit of the Spirit. Nine character traits, love, joy, peace, patience, and so on. That are the results of a supernaturally changed heart, a permanently changed heart. They are traits that can't be produced by willpower.

### The Misconception of Moral Restraint

And yet here in this passage, I think Paul is showing us that it is very possible to mistake a morally restrained heart for a supernaturally changed heart. To mistake it. And we're so shocked when we find it hasn't really, we haven't really changed. We've been restraining ourselves through our willpower, we haven't actually changed from the inside.

And what we're going to do over the next few weeks is we're going to do a series on the fruit of the Spirit. We're going to take each of those nine fruit that Paul talks about in Galatians 5. And each week, we're going to look at one of them as a sign of, and as a mark of a supernaturally changed heart to help us understand what it means to develop such a heart.

But here today, this passage, in some ways, is very simple. In other ways, it's very profound. And as always, when you actually delve into see what it's actually saying, since we are used to reading it at weddings, it's always kind of a shock. But what this is about is to tell us what a supernaturally changed heart is not and what it is and how it comes.

A supernaturally changed heart is, first of all, not the same as a busy life in service of others. And secondly, it's not the same as a morally committed life. That's in verses 1, 2, and 3. But then lastly, a supernaturally changed life is to meet love as a power and as a person.

### Meeting Love as a Power and a Person

So, that's what we're going to learn. Supernaturally changed our heart. It's not the same as a busy active life. It's not the same as the morally committed life. It's meeting love as a power and a person, first.

Verse 1 and 2. Paul makes a list of things that really are abilities, their talents, their gifts. If I speak in a tongues of men and of angels, or if I have the gift of prophecy, if I can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that moves mountains, let's go down that list. The first part, he's talking about the things that he's been discussing in chapter 12, 1 Corinthians. He's talking about what we might call the miraculous gifts or the extraordinary gifts. He's talking about prophecy and miracles and getting revelations from God.

And we're not going to go into that even though some of you might like me to go into it. We're not going to go into it. We're just going to see what he says about that. Those are very, very spectacular gifts. And then he talks about fathoming all mysteries. And Pauline language means understanding God's revelation and particularly the Bible. So here he's talking about a person who's gifted at understanding and teaching the Bible.

Then thirdly, he says, faith to move mountains. Now, that's not the normal kind of faith that we need in order to connect to God. Faith to move mountains is visionary faith. It's inspiring faith. It's faith that inspires people. Paul's talking about talents and gifts, artistic gifts, academic gifts, leadership gifts. And the Corinthian church was filled with them because Corinth was like New York in some ways. It was an urban center. It was a financial center. It was a place in which people came to excel. And as a result, it was filled with smart talented people. And therefore, the church was filled with smart talented people and it was a growing church. And it was constantly serving people and it was helping people. And everybody was very, very active.

And Paul shockingly says it's possible to even have miraculous gifts like prophecy. It's possible to have tremendous leadership gifts, tremendous preaching and teaching gifts without love. It's possible to be doing all of this not out of love.

Now you say, what do you mean? What does that mean? Well, here's what it means. If we can skip for a second ahead, verses 4 to 7, which is the guts of the text, where it says, love is patient, kind, does not envy, does not boast. You know what he's actually giving us here? If you read the entire rest of 1 Corinthians, you know that verses 4 to 7 is a list of everything the Corinthian Christians are not. They're impatient. They're unkind. They're rude. They're boastful. They're bragging. They're condescending. They're gifted. They're talented. They're successful. They're starting new ministries and starting new nonprofits. Do they have them like that? And they're doing things for people, but they're character and their attitudes. They're cranky. They're crabby. They're impatient. They're condescending. They're always having fights. They're always hurting to those feelings. They're always getting their noses bent out of shape.

And Paul says, that is not insignificant. Boy, do we need to hear this now? See, like Corinth, we live in an urban culture. And let's face it, in New York, what really counts? What really counts? Are you smart? Are you the best? Can you produce? Okay, so you got character flaws. Well, you're a colorful character.

Okay, I was just reading a book by a wife of a former of a man who's now gone, Norman Miller. Did you read that? His last wife and she's written a biography. And of course, Norman Miller was a brilliant author and everybody came out to listen to him and he ran for mayor. Okay, so he stabbed one of his wives with a knife. He's a colorful character. See, what really matters is he has the gift. He has the talent.

And Paul totally reverses that and he says, no, it's the other way around. He says, if you're brilliant, if you're gifted, if you're talented, even in God's service, even doing all this for God, but in your heart, you're filled with envy and pride and anger and insecurity. You're nothing. That is of no value to God at all.

And actually, one of the things that's most frightening here, I mean, this is a very direct statement. He's trying to say it's possible to have little grace in the heart. That means to have given God very little of your heart and yet be very successful in ministry. That's what this is saying. And it's even saying it's possible to be successful in ministry and not having and not actually given your given God your heart at all. At one point, he says, you're nothing. It's possible to be nothing.

You know, in Matthew 721, there's a place where Jesus says, on the last day, some people are going to come to me and they're going to say, Lord, Lord, didn't we prophesy in your name? These people prophesy, just like first Corinthians, prophesy. And did we not cast out devils and demons? And didn't we in my name do many wonderful works? And I will say to them, I never knew you.

Now you see, how could a person be a great preacher, cast out demons, and actually have God's spirit help people through that person and not even be actually have ever given God his heart at all? Is that possible? Sure it is. Hey, look, you know, people need help, right? If you're going out there and in your heart, you're still filled with pride, you're still filled with anger, you're still filled with all sorts of inner self-centeredness and self-absorption, and you're out there trying to help people, you know, maybe God will, God's spirit will use you. Why not? Temporarily, why not? People need help. But don't you dare, Paul says, look at that and say, God's with me. And that's scary.

So the first thing we see here is a supernaturally changed heart, though it will always lead to a life of service. We got to remember that you must not identify with a life of service because you can have a life of service without having a supernaturally changed heart, that's 0.1, 0.2.

Let's move on to chapter 3. The second thing we learn here is you mustn't mistake a supernaturally changed heart for a morally committed heart, a life. So it says in verse 3, now he's moving on, and if I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames but have not loved, I gain nothing.

Now this is very interesting. These are not talents, are they? He's moved away from the talent and gift list, and now he's moved into what the Greek philosophers would call a virtue list, a list of virtues. And Aristotle has them, they all had them, you know, prudence and self-control and justice and wisdom, and so, and Paul gives us a kind of mini-list and it's quite powerful, a list of virtues.

Now we're talking about moral fortitude, moral commitment. On the one hand he says, if I give all I possess to the poor, now today we would call that a liberal virtue, social justice, but by the way, look at it. It's not just, you know, a charitable handout, if I give all my possessions to the poor, here's someone so committed to the poor that he or she is living in voluntary poverty, just living in voluntary poverty, it gives away most are all of what you have and just lives with the poor. Isn't that something? Wow, that's virtue.

And on the other hand, and if I surrender, surrender my body to the flames, then what's that? See that's dying for your faith, going to the lions, going to the stake, and that's what most people would call a conservative virtue in a way because to stand up for your faith and to die for your faith, you know, that's the sort of thing that people consider kind of traditional religion.

So here you have the list. Paul says, I say, name me all the virtues, name me all the moral commitments there are. It's possible to do that without any love in your heart at all, not out of love and therefore, before God, it's spiritually valueless. It's nothing.

Now, so Paul actually says, here's a virtue list and that's as valueless. Again, let's get this straight, a supernaturally changed heart will lead to a morally committed life but you can easily have a morally committed life without a supernaturally changed heart at all and it's very, very easy to mistake one for the other.

Now, how does that work? Well, go up to verse one. Almost everybody goes right on by this. If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but have not loved, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging symbol. Now, what's so bad about, have you ever thought about that? What's so bad about a symbol? I love the symbols. Don't you love the symbols? What's so bad about that? What's hollow about that? What's, what is that? That verse makes no sense unless, as the commentators say, it's referring to the worship of the various temples of those Greco-Roman cities like in Corinth. They had all the various gods, they had all the various pagan temples and the way worship was done was a great processional in which there were gongs and there were symbols and that you were wearing your finery, it was a parade and the purpose of it was to honor the god, to get the gods attention, to get the gods approval. Look how much we venerate you, you know, look at it.

And Paul says, do you know it's possible to do not only Christian ministry but to do, but also to practice Christian ethics and virtue, it's possible to obey the thing commandments and go to church and get active in church and try to help people and do it to get gods approval. You're not doing it for God's sake, you're not doing it just because you love Him for who He is in Himself, you're trying to get things from God and you're not helping the people for their sake, you're helping them for your sake, you're trying to get the applause, you're trying to get the approval.

And Paul is saying here the telltale sign that though you're morally committed in the broad sense and you are active in helping other people and giving your money away to charity and the poor and all that in the broad sense, yet the telltale sign that you're doing it for you, you're not doing it out of love, you're not doing it for love of God or love for other people, it's all about you is the erasiveness, it's the rudeness, it's the stepping on each other's toes, you know, churches, these are churches, a comment is the typical church, people who are broadly moral and very active in serving God and other people and have the people aren't speaking to each other because they're so mad at the others.

There's the gossip, there's the backbiting, there's the envy, there's the rudeness, there's the boasting, there's the bragging, there's the critical spirits, there's the impatience, there's the abrasiveness, the self-pitting, the self-absorption, the vanity, the anxiety, the insecurity, it's all there. All underneath all of the morality, yeah, they're moral and underneath all the service, yeah, they're very active and Paul says that's absolutely deadly and he say, well, how can that be?

Well, let's let me give you what I still think is the best way to understand this. Let's think about, let's do a case study, let's think about how we actually teach children to be honest and not to lie. How do we do that? We appeal to two things, fear and pride. We ratchet up fear and pride. Now there's two ways, first of all, and we're talking about anywhere, public schools, church, synagogue, wherever. How do we teach children not to lie? We're home, family. One is we appeal to fear. We say you'll get caught, the teacher will catch you, the police will catch you, God will catch you, and worse, I will catch you. Worse than all of that, I will catch you. So what are we doing? We're ratchet. It will not pay. It will not pay. You're going to get it. Your sins will find you out. Your lies will find you out. So the first thing is you get them scared. You say you better not lie if you lie and you get, it won't pay for you. That's fear.

The other thing to do is pride. It is you can appeal to pride and you can say to the child, you know why you should tell the truth because you don't want to be like those awful liars, liars. And sometimes if we catch the child instead of just saying what you do is wrong, we shame them. Why are? Because, and what are we trying to do? We're trying to get the child to be truthful by getting the child to disdain a certain kind of person. Liars. Liars. You liar.

So now let's think about what is fear and pride? What is fear and pride? It's self-centeredness. It's enhancing a person's self-centeredness. It's teaching them to look down to certain people. It's teaching them to think about. And you know, here's what's going on. What is wrong with the world? It's self-centeredness. It's the impulse of every human heart that goes me, me, me first. What about me? That's self-centeredness. And instead of putting a stake, you know, a wooden stake in the heart of self-centeredness, the way in which we teach people to be good is we enhance the self-centeredness and then jury-rig it so that it's keeping the kid or the person from telling, you know, from doing wrong.

But let's think for a second, everybody. Why do we lie? There's lying everywhere. There's deception everywhere. There's corruption everywhere. There's embezzling everywhere. It's awful. Okay, why do we lie? Fear and pride are the reasons we lie. We lie when we're afraid of losing face or when we're afraid of losing power or afraid of losing something and we lie out of pride. I feel like I can pull the wool over these people's eyes. I can, you know, these people don't deserve it. I can do this. I can do that. And so when you enhance in a person's life, fear and pride in order to get them to lie, you're actually setting them up eventually too. I mean, tell the truth. You're setting them up eventually to lie because something will change. Something will come along. You'll take your hand off of the rubber ball and it'll snap back and you'll say, and after you've embezzled or after you've lashed out or after you've cheated on your spouse and you can say, what did I do that for? I wasn't raised that way. Yes, you were. We're all raised that way. That's how we get people to be good. We squeeze that little rubber ball through fear and pride, but it doesn't really change it. It doesn't change the self-centeredness. It enhances it. It doesn't change. It doesn't destroy it. It doesn't want to stay through its heart.

And that's the reason why you see in the short run, people being moral, but having all of these underlying tell-tale signs, the unkindness, the impatience, the grumpiness, the crabbyness, you know, they're always being hurt. They're always having your feeling hurt. Your ego is always being hurt. See, that's the tell-tale sign underneath the broad morality, but at some point, even the broad morality breaks through for as many of us, many of us.

So many people, the good, I mean, you know, why, for example, why is it that so many high-level public officials do the most ridiculous things fall to scandal and blow their entire careers up? It happens all the time every year, a couple, right? You know why? Because they're being morally committed, huh? And they're being and they're being serving people, and they're giving their lives in public service. And very often, because they're in public service, they're making far less money than the other people they want to graduate school with. We're making ten times more. And deep inside, what happens? Self-pity, self-pity. They start to say, oh, nobody knows what I go through. And next thing, you know, there's the opportunity for, you know, cutting a corner here, taking some money here, having an affair over here, and the person says, I deserve it. Was that come from? They come from the self-pity. It comes from the self-absorption. It comes from what's going on inside the heart, in spite of the fact that the person out there is being, you know, so good.

Paul says, it's absolutely deadly. Don't you see? Don't you recognize it in yourself? You are settling for something that's going to blow up on you. And therefore, we see that even the list, the virtual list, you know, this is Aristotle's generosity, integrity, justice, prudence, self-control, they can all be done out of an inner joy or out of an inner emptiness.

Why do you think Jesus Christ said, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scraps and Pharisees, you can have nothing of me. He's trying to say, look at the scraps and Pharisees. Look at their kind of morality. There's a kind of morality. It's morally restrained. You've got to go way deeper than that.

So how do we? 0.3. Get to verses 4 to 7 and we see really what a supernaturally changed heart is. You have to meet love as both a power and a person.

Now here's what I mean by that. It's actually stronger in the Greek than it comes across in English, but what's so striking about verses 4 to 7 is that Paul does not say, I want you to be patient. I want you to be kind. I don't want you to envy. I don't want you to boast. I want you to not be proud. It doesn't say that. Instead, he personifies love. It's all transitive verbs. Love becomes an individual, a person. It says love, by the way, literally, verse 4 says, love suffers long. That's patience. Love suffers long without you know, and bears it. Love is so kind. Love does not envy. And love is a person doing this.

Instead of saying, here's what I want you to be. He gives us a picture of an active force, a personal force who's living in a particular way. Why is he doing that? Well, here, first of all, to get across the idea that real love only develops when you meet love. Real love doesn't happen through trying, but through receiving and through meeting.

What do I mean by that? Well, you know, if he actually said, now, here's what I want you to do, do these 10 things. It would be a set of rules that we are supposed to pick up and try to do. But honestly, Paul is saying, no, love is not first something you do. It's a power that picks you up and changes you.

And I want you to know that this actually sounds very mystical and supernatural, but it's really not. If you think about it, here's what we know about children. Social scientists have studied this. It's tragic. It always kind of, you know, moves you. But we know that if a child, if an infant is born and is put into an environment where the child's never picked up, never held, never loved, never cooed to, nobody ever does baby talk and smile at its face. Now, the worst, if you don't love a child at all, as the child grows up, just what happens is the child say, well, I'm going to have to really know the child's incapable of love, basically. The child's broken. The child can't give or receive it. We know that. In fact, in many cases, they die before they even grow. Why? Because essentially, we learn to love by being loved. We don't just try. We learn to love by being loved. The more we're loved, the more we can reflect love. It's just we know that. The more we're just embraced by love and surrounded by love and just flooded with love as we are born and grow up, the more we can do it. Because before love is something you try to do, love is something you meet, something you receive. Love is not something that you try to do, but it's a power that picks you up and changes you. And that's really important.

And therefore, if we're really going to develop this love, it means we have to have a very powerful experience of love beyond. See, if we know that there's something wrong with us, we may have had the parental love so that we grew up as normally adjusted human beings in general. We know there's still stuff wrong with us, which means we need another kind of love infinitely higher than anything even the best parents could have given. And we need to meet that love and we need to receive that love. If we're going to move ourselves, if we're going to be moved to another plane.

So first of all, he personifies love to get across the idea that love is a power, but secondly, he personifies love to get us to think of a person. Look, this isn't just poetry. This isn't just poetry when he says, love suffers long. Love is kind when he personifies love. This isn't just poetry. I'll tell you why.

If versus four to seven is nothing but a kind of abstract model, a picture of a perfectly loving person, if that's all it is, if Paul is saying, I want you to think about a person who is perfectly patient, incredibly kind, never boasts, never self-seeking, never keeps a record of wrongs. If he's just laying in front of me an example of a perfectly loving person, I don't want it, and neither do you, because all you're going to do, are you going to say, wow, I can be like that? No, you're going to say, wow, I could never be like that. If you know any experience with your own heart, if versus four to seven is just giving us a general picture of a perfectly loving person, it'll crush you. I don't want it. Let's tear it out.

But I don't think Paul is. For Paul to personify love, and then to imagine that he's not got a particular person in mind is to not know Paul at all. And here's what I want you to consider. When Paul wrote, love suffers long. How could he not have been thinking about the one who said, my God, my God, why has thou forsaken me? There's infinite suffering. And when it says out of love, and when it says, love does not keep a record of wrongs, how could he not be thinking about the one who said, father forgive them? They don't know what they're doing. They were killing him. They were killing him. And he says, father forgive them. They don't know what they're doing.

And when he says, love always protects, always hopes, how could he not be thinking about the one who said, today, you'll be with me in paradise. Even though he was being killed, even though he was dying, he was able to turn to someone, to turn to the thief on the cross and say, I want you with me in paradise. And when you see hope, when you see love perseveres, love perseveres. One of the most amazing things that Jesus said on the cross was it is finished. Which as some of you know is a Greek word that means it's completed. It's been accomplished. It amazes me just as he's dying. He says, it is finished. You know what he means? Here he is. Here's a man in strip naked. Here's a man abandoned. Here's a man penniless. Here's a man tortured. Here's a man powerless. Here's a man everyone is left. And just before he dies, he says, I did it. I did it. What did he do? He accomplished our salvation because he died on the cross in our place and took our punishment, which is a way of saying he refused to die until he had done what he'd come to do. Love perseveres.

And by the way, love never fails. And how in the world could anyone write that, especially St. Paul without thinking, as much as I love my wife, as much as I love my children, someday I'll be dead. Who could you really say, who could you speak about and say his love never fails? There is only one. Jesus Christ said, I will never, never, never, never, never forsake you. That's in Hebrews. And so we have that great hymn that goes, you know, that soul that all hell shall endeavor to shake. I'll never, no, never, no, never forsake. And how do you know that? We know that because Jesus Christ took hell for us, even hell couldn't push him away from doing what he wanted to do for us. He did it.

Now, here's the point. You can look at verses four to seven as an abstract person who perfectly loves you. And that will never change your heart. It'll only crush you under guilt. It'll just say, I'm going to have to really try hard if I'm going to be like this. Or you could see Jesus Christ being all of that things in the ultimate example of it on the cross loving doing all that for you. Not doing all that just as an example, but doing all that for you in your place as your savior. And when you see that, what will that do? Do you believe that? Do you embrace that? Do you take it in and think about that and sort of taste it on the palate of your heart, day and day out? Here's what's it's going to do. It's going to get rid of your fear every day a little bit more. It's going to get rid of your fear. You're not going to be afraid of losing face. Who cares? You're not going to be afraid of losing anything. So on the one hand, it's going to value you out of your fear because he loves you like that. But on the other hand, it's going to humble you out of your pride because you know he loves you in spite of everything.

And so if you look at love as an abstraction and just try to live up to it, it'll either fill you with pride because you think you're doing it or it'll fill you with fear because you know you're not. Or you could look at Jesus Christ doing it for you and that destroys your fear, destroys your pride and begins to regenerate your heart from the inside. So if you see Jesus Christ doing the love of verses 4 to 7 for you, eventually that love will be reproduced in you.

Let's go get a supernaturally changed heart. Let's begin right away. Let's pray.

Father, we thank you that this text is not at all like what we think it is. Of course, it is what it appears to be on the surface. It is a wonderful inventory of what it means to have a loving relationship. It's a wonderful blueprint for how to run a marriage or any relationship or how to run all of our relationships. And yet it goes much deeper than that. It shows us that we have to meet your Son, Jesus Christ on the cross. The ultimate example of suffering long, the ultimate example of not keeping a record of wrongs, the ultimate example of love that perseveres and never, never fails. It can't fail. There's no condemnation now for those who are in Christ Jesus. And we pray, Lord, that we would be so melted by, affected by the love done for us that reproduces that same love in us as our fear and pride melt away over time. Lord, we would be willing to confess that to a great degree we have not been very affected by the gospel. And the cross and what Jesus has done. And we want to begin to develop supernaturally changed hearts now. Meet us now. We pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.

### 引言：改变的挑战

我们中的许多人试图通过纯粹的意志力来改变，克服坏习惯或强迫自己表现得更好，但最终发现自己又回到了旧的模式。在今天的信息中，Tim Keller 探讨了圣灵的果子，展示了真正的转变不是关于道德约束，而是通过基督从内心深处改变的心。

今天的经文选自哥林多前书第 13 章，第 1 到 13 节。

> “我若能说万人的方言，并天使的话语，却没有爱，我就成了鸣的锣，响的钹一般。我若有先知讲道之能，也明白各样的奥秘，各样的知识，而且有全备的信，可以移山，却没有爱，我就算不得什么。我若将所有的赒济穷人，又舍己身叫人焚烧，却没有爱，仍然于我无益。爱是恒久忍耐，又有恩慈；爱是不嫉妒；爱是不自夸，不张狂，不作害羞的事，不求自己的益处，不轻易发怒，不计算人的恶，不喜欢不义，只喜欢真理；凡事包容，凡事相信，凡事盼望，凡事忍耐。爱是永不止息。先知讲道之能终必归于无有，说方言之能终必停止，知识也终必归于无有。我们现在所知道的有限，先知所讲的也有限；等那完全的来到，这有限的必归于无有。我们如今仿佛对着镜子观看，模糊不清，到那时就要面对面了。我如今所知道的有限，到那时就全知道，如同主知道我一样。如今常存的有信，有望，有爱这三样，其中最大的是爱。”

这是主的话。

当你听到这段经文时，你会立刻想到伴娘和花童。虽然这段经文确实是婚礼的绝佳选择，尤其是其中描述爱的部分，你找不到比这更好的婚姻指南。但我要告诉你，保罗写这段经文不是为了婚礼。他是为了改变而写的。

### 超自然改变的心的本质

几乎我们所有人都有生活中想要改变的部分。但改变真的很难。如果你拿一个可乐罐，用手压扁它，使它占用更少的空间，它变小了。然后你把手拿开，它保持在你放置的位置。但如果你拿一个橡皮球，用手挤压它，使它占用更少的空间，然后你把手拿开，它会立刻恢复到原来的样子。为什么？因为橡皮球，你只是暂时约束了它，但你并没有真正改变它。

**你改变了可乐罐，但你并没有真正改变橡皮球。你只是约束了它，它会反弹回来。**

现在几乎我们所有人都有这样的经历，橡皮球的经历，我是说，我们出去试图改变生活的某些部分，并在其上投入大量的意志力。我们对生活的某些部分施加了很大的压力。我们说我想我做到了。然后一旦你放松，或者环境改变，它就会反弹回来。这对基督徒来说也是如此。

这就是这段经文的信息。在加拉太书第 5 章，保罗列出了九种他称之为圣灵的果子。九种性格特征，爱、喜乐、和平、忍耐等等。这些是超自然改变的心的结果，一个永久改变的心。它们是无法通过意志力产生的特征。

### 对道德约束的误解

然而在这段经文中，我认为保罗向我们展示了将道德约束的心误认为是超自然改变的心是非常可能的。误解它。当我们发现它并没有真正改变时，我们感到震惊。我们通过意志力约束了自己，但我们实际上并没有从内心改变。

在接下来的几周里，我们将进行一系列关于圣灵果子的讲道。我们将逐一探讨保罗在加拉太书 5 章中谈到的九种果子。每周，我们将把其中一种作为超自然改变的心的标志和标记，帮助我们理解发展这样一颗心的意义。

但今天，这段经文在某些方面非常简单。在其他方面，它非常深刻。正如往常，当你真正深入研究它的实际含义时，因为我们习惯于在婚礼上阅读它，总是有点震惊。但这段经文是为了告诉我们什么是超自然改变的心，什么不是，以及它是如何产生的。

首先，超自然改变的心与忙碌的服务他人的生活不同。其次，它与道德承诺的生活不同。这在第 1、2 和 3 节中。但最后，超自然改变的生活是将爱视为一种力量和一个人。

### 将爱视为力量和个人的相遇

所以，这就是我们要学习的。超自然改变的心。它与忙碌的积极生活不同。它与道德承诺的生活不同。首先是将爱视为一种力量和一个人。

第 1 和 2 节。保罗列出了一些实际上是能力、天赋和恩赐的东西。如果我能说万人的方言和天使的话语，或者我有先知讲道的恩赐，如果我能明白所有的奥秘和所有的知识，并且有信心可以移山，让我们看看这个列表。第一部分，他在谈论他在哥林多前书第 12 章中讨论的事情。他在谈论我们可能称之为奇迹的恩赐或非凡的恩赐。他在谈论预言和奇迹以及从神那里得到的启示。

我们不会深入探讨这一点，尽管你们中的一些人可能希望我深入探讨。我们不会深入探讨。我们只会看看他对这些恩赐的看法。这些是非常非常壮观的恩赐。然后他谈到明白所有的奥秘。在保罗的语言中，这意味着理解神的启示，尤其是圣经。所以在这里，他在谈论一个有理解和教授圣经恩赐的人。

然后第三，他说，信心可以移山。现在，这不是我们需要的那种正常信心来与神连接。信心可以移山是愿景信心。这是鼓舞人心的信心。这是激励人们的信心。保罗在谈论天赋和恩赐，艺术天赋，学术天赋，领导天赋。哥林多教会充满了这些，因为哥林多在某些方面像纽约。它是一个城市中心。它是一个金融中心。它是一个人们来这里追求卓越的地方。因此，它充满了聪明有才华的人。因此，教会充满了聪明有才华的人，并且是一个不断发展的教会。它不断地服务人们并帮助人们。每个人都非常非常活跃。

保罗令人震惊地说，即使拥有像预言这样的奇迹恩赐也是可能的。即使拥有巨大的领导才能，巨大的讲道和教学恩赐也是可能的，而没有爱。可能做这一切不是出于爱。

现在你会说，这是什么意思？这是什么意思？好吧，这就是它的意思。如果我们可以跳过一秒钟，看看第 4 到 7 节，这是文本的核心部分，其中说，爱是耐心的，仁慈的，不嫉妒，不自夸。你知道他实际上在给我们什么吗？如果你阅读哥林多前书的其余部分，你会知道第 4 到 7 节是哥林多基督徒所没有的一切。他们不耐烦。他们不仁慈。他们粗鲁。他们自夸。他们吹嘘。他们居高临下。他们有天赋。他们有才华。他们成功。他们正在创办新事工和新非营利组织。他们有这样的组织吗？他们在为人们做事，但他们的性格和态度。他们暴躁。他们脾气暴躁。他们不耐烦。他们居高临下。他们总是在争吵。他们总是伤害别人的感情。他们总是让自己的鼻子变形。

保罗说，这并不是无关紧要的。天哪，我们现在需要听到这个吗？看看哥林多，我们生活在一个城市文化中。让我们面对现实，在纽约，真正重要的是什么？真正重要的是什么？你聪明吗？你是最好的？你能生产吗？好吧，所以你有性格缺陷。好吧，你是一个多彩的人物。

好吧，我刚刚读了一本书，是一个已故的人的妻子写的，诺曼·米勒。你读过吗？他的最后一任妻子，她写了一本传记。当然，诺曼·米勒是一位杰出的作家，每个人都来听他演讲，他还竞选市长。好吧，所以他用刀刺伤了他的一个妻子。他是一个多彩的人物。看，真正重要的是他有天赋。他有才华。

保罗完全颠倒了这一点，他说，不，是相反的。他说，如果你聪明，如果你有天赋，如果你有才华，即使在为神服务，即使为神做这一切，但在你的心中，你充满了嫉妒和骄傲和愤怒和不安全感。你什么都不是。这对神来说毫无价值。

实际上，这里最可怕的事情之一，我的意思是，这是一个非常直接的声明。他试图说，心中可能几乎没有恩典。这意味着你几乎没有把你的心给神，但在事工中非常成功。这就是这段经文所说的。它甚至说，在事工中取得成功是可能的，而实际上并没有把你的心给神。在某一点上，他说，你什么都不是。可能什么都不是。

你知道，在马太福音 7:21 中，有一个地方，耶稣说，在最后一天，有些人会来到我面前，他们会说，主啊，主啊，我们不是奉你的名预言吗？这些人预言，就像哥林多前书一样，预言。我们不是奉你的名赶鬼吗？我们不是奉你的名行许多奇事吗？我会对他们说，我从来不认识你。

现在你看，一个人怎么可能是一个伟大的传道人，赶鬼，并且实际上让神的灵通过那个人帮助人，而实际上从未把心给神？这可能吗？当然可能。嘿，看，人们需要帮助，对吧？如果你出去，在你的心中，你仍然充满了骄傲，你仍然充满了愤怒，你仍然充满了各种内心的自我中心和自我吸收，而你在那里试图帮助人们，你知道，也许神会，神的灵会使用你。为什么不呢？暂时，为什么不呢？人们需要帮助。但保罗说，不要胆敢看着这一切说，神与我同在。这很可怕。

所以我们在这里看到的第一件事是，超自然改变的心，尽管它总是会导致服务的生活。我们必须记住，你不能把它与服务的生活等同起来，因为你可以有服务的生活而没有超自然改变的心，这是第 0.1 点，第 0.2 点。

让我们继续第 3 章。我们在这里学到的第二件事是，你不能把超自然改变的心误认为是道德承诺的心，生活。所以在第 3 节中说，现在他继续说，如果我将所有的赒济穷人，又舍己身叫人焚烧，却没有爱，仍然于我无益。

现在这很有趣。这些不是天赋，对吗？他已经从天赋和恩赐列表中移开，现在他进入了希腊哲学家称之为美德列表的东西，美德列表。亚里士多德有这些，他们都有这些，你知道，谨慎和自制和正义和智慧等等，保罗给了我们一个小列表，它非常强大，美德列表。

现在我们在谈论道德的坚韧，道德的承诺。一方面他说，如果我将所有的赒济穷人，现在今天我们会称之为自由主义美德，社会正义，但顺便说一下，看看它。这不仅仅是，你知道，慈善捐赠，如果我将所有的赒济穷人，这里有一个人如此致力于穷人，以至于他或她生活在自愿贫困中，只是生活在自愿贫困中，放弃了大部分或所有你拥有的东西，只是与穷人一起生活。这不是很了不起吗？哇，那是美德。

另一方面，如果我舍己身叫人焚烧，那是什么？看，那是为你的信仰而死，去狮子那里，去火刑柱那里，那是大多数人会称之为保守主义美德的东西，因为为了你的信仰而站出来并为你的信仰而死，你知道，那是人们认为的传统宗教的东西。

所以这里有列表。保罗说，我说，给我列出所有的美德，给我列出所有的道德承诺。可能做到这一点而心中没有任何爱，不是出于爱，因此，在神面前，它在灵性上毫无价值。什么都不是。

现在，所以保罗实际上说，这里有一个美德列表，那是毫无价值的。再说一次，让我们弄清楚，超自然改变的心会导致道德承诺的生活，但你可以很容易地有道德承诺的生活而没有超自然改变的心，这很容易把一个误认为另一个。

那么，这如何运作？好吧，上到第 1 节。几乎每个人都直接跳过这一点。如果我能说万人的方言和天使的话语，却没有爱，我就成了鸣的锣，响的钹一般。现在，有什么不好的，你有没有想过这一点？钹有什么不好的？我喜欢钹。你不喜欢钹吗？有什么不好的？有什么空洞的？这是什么？那节经文没有意义，除非，正如评论家所说，它指的是那些希腊罗马城市如哥林多的各种神庙的崇拜。他们有各种各样的神，他们有各种各样的异教神庙，崇拜的方式是一场盛大的游行，其中有锣和钹，你穿着盛装，那是一场游行，目的是为了荣耀神，吸引神的注意，获得神的认可。看看我们多么尊敬你，你知道，看看。

保罗说，你知道不仅可以做基督教事工，还可以实践基督教伦理和美德，可以遵守十诫，去教堂，积极参与教会，试图帮助人们，并且这样做是为了获得神的认可。你不是为了神而做的，你不是因为你爱他而做的，你是为了从神那里得到东西，你不是为了他们的缘故而帮助人们，你是为了自己的缘故而帮助他们，你是为了得到掌声，你是为了得到认可。

保罗在这里说，尽管你在广义上道德承诺，并且积极帮助他人，并且把钱捐给慈善机构和穷人等等，但你这样做的标志是为了你自己，你不是出于爱而做的，你不是出于对神的爱或对他人的爱而做的，这一切都是关于你的，是不礼貌的，是踩在彼此的脚趾上，你知道，教会，这些是教会，评论是典型的教会，人们在广义上是道德的，并且非常积极地服务神和他人，并且有些人不说话，因为他们对其他人非常生气。

诗篇可以深刻地塑造你接近神的方式，甚至耶稣依靠诗篇来面对每一种情况，包括死亡。在 Tim 和 Kathy Keller 的 365 天灵修书《耶稣的诗篇》中，你会发现通过诗篇的每日阅读，带有新鲜的圣经见解。如果你没有定期的灵修习惯，这本书是一个很好的开始方式，如果你已经花时间在学习和祷告上，那么通过诗篇的阅读和祷告可以帮助你将最深的情感和问题带到神面前，并发现与他的新层次的亲密关系。我们将把 Tim 和 Kathy Keller 的灵修书作为感谢你的礼物，帮助福音与生活与更多人分享耶稣的爱。今天就请求你的副本，访问 gospelandlife.com/give，那是 gospelandlife.com/give。

有八卦，有背后议论，有嫉妒，有粗鲁，有自夸，有吹嘘，有批评的精神，有不耐烦，有粗暴，有自怜，有自我吸收，有虚荣，有焦虑，有不安全感，这一切都在那里。在所有的道德之下，是的，他们是道德的，在所有的服务之下，是的，他们非常活跃，保罗说那是绝对致命的，他说，怎么会这样呢？

好吧，让我给你我仍然认为是理解这一点的最佳方式。让我们想一想，让我们做一个案例研究，让我们想一想我们实际上是如何教孩子诚实和不撒谎的。我们怎么做到这一点？我们诉诸于两件事，恐惧和骄傲。我们加剧恐惧和骄傲。现在有两种方式，首先，我们在谈论任何地方，公立学校，教会，犹太教堂，任何地方。我们如何教孩子不撒谎？我们在家里，家庭。一个是我们诉诸于恐惧。我们说你会被抓住，老师会抓住你，警察会抓住你，神会抓住你，更糟糕的是，我会抓住你。比这一切更糟糕的是，我会抓住你。那么我们在做什么？我们在加剧。它不会有好结果。它不会有好结果。你会得到它。你的罪会找出你。你的谎言会找出你。所以第一件事是让他们害怕。你说你最好不要撒谎，如果你撒谎，你会得到，它对你没有好处。那是恐惧。

另一件事是骄傲。你可以诉诸于骄傲，你可以对孩子说，你知道为什么你应该说实话，因为你不想成为那些可怕的骗子，骗子。有时如果我们抓住孩子而不是只是说你做错了，我们羞辱他们。为什么？因为，我们在试图做什么？我们在试图通过让孩子鄙视某种人来让孩子诚实。骗子。骗子。你这个骗子。

所以现在让我们想一想，什么是恐惧和骄傲？什么是恐惧和骄傲？是自我中心。是增强一个人的自我中心。是教他们看不起某些人。是教他们思考。你知道，这里发生了什么。世界上有什么问题？是自我中心。是每个人心中的冲动，首先想到我，我，我。那是自我中心。我们没有在自我中心的心中插入木桩，我们教人们变得好的方式是增强自我中心，然后临时拼凑起来，以便它阻止孩子或人做错事。

但让我们想一想，大家。我们为什么撒谎？到处都是谎言。到处都是欺骗。到处都是腐败。到处都是挪用公款。这太可怕了。好吧，我们为什么撒谎？恐惧和骄傲是我们撒谎的原因。当我们害怕失去面子或害怕失去权力或害怕失去某些东西时，我们撒谎，我们出于骄傲而撒谎。我觉得我可以蒙蔽这些人的眼睛。我可以，你知道，这些人不值得。我可以这样做。我可以那样做。所以当你在一个人的生活中增强恐惧和骄傲以使他们撒谎时，你实际上是在为他们最终撒谎做准备。我是说，告诉真相。你实际上是在为他们最终撒谎做准备，因为某些事情会改变。某些事情会发生。你会把手从橡皮球上拿开，它会反弹回来，你会说，在你挪用公款或在你发泄怒火或在你欺骗配偶之后，你会说，我为什么要这样做？我不是这样被抚养长大的。是的，你是。我们都是这样被抚养长大的。这就是我们让人们变得好的方式。我们通过恐惧和骄傲挤压那个小橡皮球，但它并没有真正改变它。它没有改变自我中心。它增强了它。它没有改变。它没有摧毁它。它没有在它的心中插入木桩。

这就是为什么你会看到在短期内，人们是道德的，但有所有这些潜在的迹象，不友善，不耐烦，脾气暴躁，脾气暴躁，你知道，他们总是受伤。他们总是感到受伤。你的自尊总是受伤。看，那是潜在的迹象，在广义的道德之下，但在某一点上，即使是广义的道德也会突破，对于我们中的许多人，许多人。

所以很多人，好的，我是说，你知道，为什么，例如，为什么这么多高级公共官员做最荒谬的事情，陷入丑闻，毁掉他们的整个职业生涯？每年都有这样的事情发生，对吧？你知道为什么吗？因为他们在道德上承诺，嗯？他们在服务人们，他们在公共服务中奉献自己的生命。通常，因为他们在公共服务中，他们赚的钱比他们想要的研究生院的其他人少得多。我们赚了十倍多。在内心深处，发生了什么？自怜，自怜。他们开始说，哦，没有人知道我经历了什么。接下来，你知道，有机会在这里走捷径，在这里拿些钱，在这里有外遇，那个人人说，我应得的。那是从哪里来的？它来自自怜。它来自自我吸收。它来自心中发生的事情，尽管那个人在外面是如此的好。

保罗说，这绝对是致命的。你不明白吗？你不在自己身上认出它吗？你在为一些会在你身上爆炸的东西妥协。因此，我们看到，即使是列表，美德列表，你知道，这是亚里士多德的慷慨，正直，正义，谨慎，自制，它们都可以出于内心的喜悦或内心的空虚来完成。

你为什么认为耶稣基督说，除非你的义超过文士和法利赛人的义，你就不能有我的任何东西。他试图说，看看文士和法利赛人。看看他们的道德。有一种道德。它是道德约束的。你必须走得更深。

那么我们如何？第 0.3 点。到第 4 到 7 节，我们真正看到超自然改变的心是什么。你必须将爱视为力量和个人。

现在这是什么意思。实际上在希腊语中比在英语中更强烈，但第 4 到 7 节中最引人注目的是，保罗没有说，我希望你有耐心。我希望你仁慈。我不希望你嫉妒。我不希望你自夸。我希望你不骄傲。它没有这样说。相反，他将爱人格化。它都是及物动词。爱成为一个个体，一个人。它说爱，顺便说一下，字面上，第 4 节说，爱是恒久忍耐。这是耐心。爱是恒久忍耐而不，你知道，并忍受。爱是如此仁慈。爱不嫉妒。爱是一个人这样做的。

而不是说，这是我希望你成为的。他给了我们一个活跃的力量，一个生活在特定方式的个人力量的图景。他为什么这样做？好吧，首先，为了传达真正的爱只有在你遇到爱时才会发展。真正的爱不是通过尝试发生的，而是通过接受和遇见。

这是什么意思？好吧，你知道，如果他真的说，现在，这是我希望你做的，做这 10 件事。那将是一套我们应该拿起并尝试做的规则。但老实说，保罗在说，不，爱不是首先你做的事情。它是一种力量，拾起你并改变你。

我想让你知道，这实际上听起来非常神秘和超自然，但实际上不是。如果你想一想，这是我们对孩子所知道的。社会科学家研究过这个。这是悲剧。它总是有点，你知道，感动你。但我们知道，如果一个孩子，如果一个婴儿出生并被放置在一个环境中，孩子从未被抱起，从未被拥抱，从未被爱，从未被咕咕叫，没有人对它做婴儿谈话并对它微笑。现在，最糟糕的是，如果你根本不爱一个孩子，当孩子长大时，发生的事情是孩子说，好吧，我将不得不真正知道孩子基本上无法爱。孩子破碎了。孩子无法给予或接受它。我们知道这一点。事实上，在许多情况下，他们在成长之前就死了。为什么？因为本质上，我们通过被爱来学习爱。我们不仅仅是尝试。我们通过被爱来学习爱。我们被爱得越多，我们就能反映出更多的爱。我们知道这一点。我们被爱包围，被爱包围，被爱淹没，我们出生并成长，我们就能做到更多。因为在爱是你尝试做的事情之前，爱是你遇到的事情，接受的事情。爱不是你尝试做的事情，而是一种力量，拾起你并改变你。这真的很重要。

因此，如果我们真的要发展这种爱，这意味着我们必须有一种非常强大的超越的爱体验。看，如果我们知道我们有问题，我们可能有父母的爱，以便我们在一般情况下成长为正常调整的人类。我们知道我们仍然有问题，这意味着我们需要另一种爱，远远高于即使是最好的父母所能给予的任何东西。我们需要遇到那种爱，我们需要接受那种爱。如果我们要移动自己，如果我们要被移动到另一个层面。

所以首先，他将爱人格化，以传达爱是一种力量的想法，但其次，他将爱人格化，以让我们想到一个人。看，这不仅仅是诗歌。这不仅仅是诗歌，当他说，爱是恒久忍耐。爱是仁慈的，当他将爱人格化时。这不仅仅是诗歌。我会告诉你为什么。

如果第 4 到 7 节只是一个抽象模型，一个完美爱人的图景，如果这就是全部，如果保罗在说，我希望你想到一个完美耐心，极其仁慈，从不自夸，从不自私，从不记仇的人。如果他只是把一个完美爱人的例子放在我面前，我不想要它，你也不想要，因为你所要做的就是，你会说，哇，我可以像那样吗？不，你会说，哇，我永远无法像那样。如果你对自己的心有任何经验，如果第 4 到 7 节只是给我们一个完美爱人的一般图景，它会压垮你。我不想要它。让我们撕掉它。

但我不认为保罗是这样。对于保罗来说，将爱人格化，然后想象他没有想到一个特定的人是完全不了解保罗的。这里是我想让你考虑的。当保罗写道，爱是恒久忍耐。他怎么可能不想到那位说，我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？那是无限的痛苦。当它说出于爱时，当它说，爱不记仇时，他怎么可能不想到那位说，父啊，原谅他们？他们不知道自己在做什么。他们在杀他。他们在杀他。他说，父啊，原谅他们。他们不知道自己在做什么。

当他说，爱总是保护，总是希望时，他怎么可能不想到那位说，今天，你将与我同在乐园。即使他被杀，即使他在死，他能够转向某人，转向十字架上的强盗说，我想要你与我同在乐园。当你看到希望，当你看到爱坚持不懈，爱坚持不懈。耶稣在十字架上说的最惊人的事情之一是成了。正如你们中的一些人所知，这是一个希腊词，意思是完成了。它已经完成了。让我惊讶的是，就在他死之前。他说，成了。你知道他是什么意思吗？他在这里。这里是一个被剥光的人。这里是一个被遗弃的人。这里是一个无钱的人。这里是一个被折磨的人。这里是一个无能为力的人。这里是一个所有人都离开的人。就在他死之前，他说，我做到了。我做到了。他做了什么？他完成了我们的救赎，因为他在十字架上为我们而死，承担了我们的惩罚，这是一种说法，他拒绝死去，直到他完成了他来做的事情。爱坚持不懈。

顺便说一下，爱永不止息。任何人怎么可能写下这一点，尤其是圣保罗而不想到，尽管我多么爱我的妻子，尽管我多么爱我的孩子，总有一天我会死。你真的可以说，谁可以说他的爱永不止息？只有一个。耶稣基督说，我永远，永远，永远，永远，永远不会离弃你。这在希伯来书中。因此，我们有那首伟大的赞美诗，它说，你知道，那灵魂，所有地狱都将努力动摇。我永远，永远，永远不会离弃。你怎么知道这一点？我们知道，因为耶稣基督为我们承受了地狱，即使地狱也无法将他推开，无法阻止他为我们做他想做的事情。他做到了。

现在，重点是。你可以将第 4 到 7 节视为一个完美爱你的抽象人。这永远不会改变你的心。它只会在罪恶下压垮你。它只会说，如果我要像这样，我必须非常努力。或者你可以看到耶稣基督在十字架上为你做这一切的终极例子，爱着为你做这一切。不仅仅是作为一个例子，而是作为你的救主为你做这一切。当你看到这一点时，这会做什么？你相信吗？你接受吗？你接受并思考这一点，并在你心灵的味蕾上品尝它，日复一日？这会做什么。它会每天一点点消除你的恐惧。它会消除你的恐惧。你不会害怕失去面子。谁在乎？你不会害怕失去任何东西。所以一方面，它会因为他如此爱你而让你摆脱恐惧。但另一方面，它会因为你知道他爱你，尽管一切而让你摆脱骄傲。

所以如果你将爱视为一个抽象概念，并试图达到它，它要么会让你充满骄傲，因为你认为你在做到这一点，要么会让你充满恐惧，因为你知道你没有做到。或者你可以看到耶稣基督为你做到这一点，这会摧毁你的恐惧，摧毁你的骄傲，并开始从内部再生你的心。所以如果你看到耶稣基督为你做第 4 到 7 节的爱，最终这种爱会在你里面再现。

让我们去获得一个超自然改变的心。让我们立即开始。让我们祷告。

父啊，我们感谢你，这段经文完全不像我们认为的那样。当然，它在表面上看起来是这样。它是一个关于拥有爱的关系的美妙清单。它是一个关于如何经营婚姻或任何关系或如何经营我们所有关系的美妙蓝图。然而，它比这更深刻。它向我们展示了我们必须在十字架上遇见你的儿子耶稣基督。恒久忍耐的终极例子，不记仇的终极例子，永不止息的爱的终极例子。它不能失败。现在在基督耶稣里的人不再有定罪。我们祈祷，主啊，我们会被为我们所做的爱所融化，所影响，以至于在我们恐惧和骄傲随着时间的推移消融时，这种爱在我们里面再现。主啊，我们愿意承认，在很大程度上，我们没有被福音和十字架以及耶稣所做的事情深深影响。我们现在想要开始发展超自然改变的心。现在与我们相遇。我们奉耶稣的名祈祷。阿门。
