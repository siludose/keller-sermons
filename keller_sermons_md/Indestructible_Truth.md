### Introduction: The Fundamental Problem

Some people say the fundamental problem of the world is poverty. Others say it's bad systems, poor education or biology, but what if none of these can fully explain the brokenness we see, both in the headlines and in our own hearts? In today's teaching, Tim Keller looks at how the Bible's teaching on sin gives us a deeply honest and yet incredibly hopeful view of the world.

### Ezekiel's Vision

I was reading Ezekiel recently and Ezekiel got to, was with the exiles and he was in a far off land and a lot of his, a lot of his fellow Jews were saying how can we worship God in a strange land and he got this vision? You're read it. It's strange, but the most important thing about Ezekiel's vision is he sees God high and lifted up and he sees them on his throne, but there's something different about Ezekiel's vision than Isaiah's vision or anybody else's vision of the throne of God. If you look to the bottom of the throne, he found that God's throne had wheels. It was a mobile God and it was a, it was God's way of saying I can make you a home that you when I can dwell in absolutely anywhere, absolutely anywhere. So welcome home.

### The Servant of the Lord

And let me read to you Isaiah 52, 13 verses, from 13 down to the end of chapter 53, 52, 13 to 53, see my servant will act wisely. He will be raised and lifted up and highly exalted just as there were many who were appalled at him. His appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any man in his form, marred beyond human likeness. So will he sprinkle many nations and kings will shut their mouths because of him for what they were not told they will see and what they have not heard they will understand.

> "Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"

**He grew up before him like a tender shoe and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.**

### The Essence of Sin

We all like sheep have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way, and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed and afflicted yet he did not open his mouth. He was led like a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers his silent, so he did not open his mouth.

### The Essence of Salvation

But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities, the punishment that brought us peace was upon him and by his wounds we are healed.

### The Meaning of the Cross

Jesus Christ did not essentially come. Every other founder comes and says, Jesus did not. Every other religion comes and says, I'm going to show you how to connect to God. Do this. Jesus Christ says, I'm going to connect you to God. I've done this or put it in another way, just number of ways to put it. It means, for example, the gospel is news, not advice.

### Conclusion: Living the Christian Life

Father, we thank you for this great survey. In some ways, it's a great way to start a service, a community worshiping community in a new place. We see the essence of what the gospel is, the essence of what sin is, and the essence of salvation and the essence of how we are to live now. We thank you that we have the only God who was the victim of injustice, not the perpetrator. A God who then makes a so rich that we can spend ourselves for other victims. A God who has become weak so that we can see the way in which weakness is strength. Father, we pray that you would help us to understand these things and work them into our lives, not just as individuals, but as a worshiping community here in this place. We thank you, Lord. And we ask that during the rest of the services we pray to you, as we offer these things to you, you might shape us and mold our hearts more in the image of what we have just seen. That of the great servant, Jesus Christ, the righteous one, in His name we pray. Amen.

## 中文翻译

### 引言：根本问题

有些人说世界的根本问题是贫穷。其他人说是糟糕的制度、教育不良或生物学，但如果这些都不能完全解释我们在头条新闻和自己内心中看到的破碎呢？在今天的教导中，Tim Keller 看圣经对罪的教导如何给我们一个深刻诚实但又极其充满希望的世界观。

### 以西结的异象

我最近在读以西结书，以西结与流亡者在一起，他在一个遥远的地方，他的许多犹太同胞都在说我们如何能在异地敬拜上帝，他得到了这个异象？你读过它。它很奇怪，但以西结异象中最重要的是他看到上帝高高在上，他看到他们在他的宝座上，但以西结的异象与以赛亚的异象或其他任何人的上帝宝座异象有所不同。如果你看宝座的底部，他发现上帝的宝座有轮子。这是一个移动的上帝，这是上帝在说我可以给你一个家，我可以在任何地方居住，任何地方。所以欢迎回家。

### 主的仆人

让我为你读以赛亚书 52 章 13 节到 53 章的结尾，52:13 到 53:12，看我的仆人将行事智慧。他将被高举并极其尊崇，正如许多人对他感到震惊。他的外貌被毁坏，超过任何人，他的形象被毁坏，超出人类的样子。因此，他将洒在许多国家，君王因他闭口不言，因为他们未曾被告知的，他们将看到，他们未曾听闻的，他们将明白。

> "谁信了我们的信息，耶和华的膀臂向谁显露呢？"

**他在他面前长大如嫩芽，像根出于干地。他无佳形美容，我们看见他的时候，也无美貌使我们羡慕他。**

### 罪的本质

我们都如羊走迷，各人偏行己路，耶和华使我们众人的罪孽都归在他身上。他被欺压，在受苦的时候却不开口。他像羊羔被牵到宰杀之地，又像羊在剪毛的人手下无声，他也是这样不开口。

### 救赎的本质

但他为我们的过犯受害，为我们的罪孽压伤，因他受的刑罚我们得平安，因他受的鞭伤我们得医治。

### 十字架的意义

耶稣基督并不是本质上来。其他每一个创始人都来并说，耶稣没有。其他每一个宗教都来并说，我要告诉你如何与上帝连接。做这个。耶稣基督说，我要连接你与上帝。我已经做了这个，或者用另一种方式说，只是有多种方式来表达。它意味着，例如，福音是新闻，而不是建议。

### 结论：活出基督徒的生命

父啊，我们感谢你这伟大的概述。在某种程度上，这是一个开始服务的好方法，一个在新地方的敬拜社区。我们看到了福音的本质，罪的本质，救赎的本质，以及我们现在应该如何生活的本质。我们感谢你，我们有唯一一个曾是受害者而不是施害者的上帝。一个使我们如此富有以至于我们可以为其他受害者付出的上帝。一个变得软弱以便我们可以看到软弱就是力量的上帝。父啊，我们祈求你帮助我们理解这些事情，并将它们融入我们的生活中，不仅作为个人，而且作为这里的敬拜社区。我们感谢你，主。我们祈求在接下来的服务中，当我们向你祷告时，当我们将这些事情献给你时，你可能塑造我们并将我们的心更多地塑造成我们刚刚看到的形象。那位伟大的仆人，耶稣基督，公义者，奉他的名祷告。阿门。
