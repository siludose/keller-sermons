### Introduction: The Search for Meaning

Have you ever found yourself asking, what if nothing I do really lasts? Is this all there is? In today's podcast, Tim Keller looks at how Ecclesiastes helps us face our doubts, fears, and uncertainties, and points us to the lasting hope and significance we have in Christ.

The book of Ecclesiastes is very, very difficult, and I'm actually teaching it to try to give you overviews. I think if anybody says, oh, this is great, and it's just down to just read it through one time, you're just going to say, what in the world is this doing in the Bible?

> "Ecclesiastes is the only book of the Bible that's written from the viewpoint of a skeptic."

**It's a brilliant piece of art.**

### The Problem of Pleasure

Now, when you go on a spiritual search, there are certain things that people always run into. Last week, we looked at one of them that the Ecclesiastes writer talks about, and that is pain. What do we do about pain? What do we do about the problem of pain?

But this week is another problem that you have to deal with if you're a spiritual searcher, Seeker. And he brings this up, and he looks at it, and here's what he says. Let's read it. Ecclesiastes 2:1 to 11. And then a section just a little later, chapter 3, verses 10 to 14, I'll read them together.

### What Pleasure Promises

Here in verse 1 to 3, it gives us something that is really very, very intriguing. He says, so I thought in my heart, come now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good. So I tried cheering myself with wine and embracing folly. I wanted to see what was worthwhile for men to do under heaven during the few days of their lives.

**Pleasure is a puzzle. Pleasure is a problem and pleasure has a lot of pointers in it.**

### Why Pleasure Fails

Now, one of the things it's important to understand and boy, this is very powerful. This is not a regular guy. No, it isn't. First 10, I denied myself nothing, my eyes desired. Now what's that? I denied myself nothing, my eyes desired.

> "Pleasure ultimately fails us."

**It fails to deliver worth-wildness.**

### How Pleasure Points Beyond

He has made everything beautiful in its time. He also has set eternity in the hearts of men, yet they cannot fathom what God has done from beginning to end.

**We are looking for transcendence, and it will fail at that. Utterly fail.**

### 引言：寻找意义

你是否曾经问过自己，如果我所做的一切都没有持久的意义，那又如何呢？这就是全部吗？在今天的播客中，Tim Keller 探讨了《传道书》如何帮助我们面对疑惑、恐惧和不确定性，并指引我们在基督里找到持久的希望和意义。

《传道书》非常非常难懂，我实际上是在教导它以便给你们一个概述。我想如果有人说，哦，这太好了，只需读一遍，你就会说，这到底在圣经中做什么？

> “《传道书》是圣经中唯一一本从怀疑者的视角写成的书。”

**这是一件杰出的艺术作品。**

### 快乐的问题

当你进行灵性探索时，人们总会遇到某些事情。上周，我们看到了传道书的作者谈到的一个问题，那就是痛苦。我们该如何处理痛苦？我们该如何处理痛苦的问题？

但本周是另一个问题，如果你是一个灵性探索者，你必须面对这个问题。他提出了这个问题，并进行了探讨，以下是他的说法。让我们来读一下。传道书 2:1-11，然后是稍后的一段，3:10-14，我会一起读。

### 快乐的承诺

在第1到3节中，它给了我们一些非常非常有趣的东西。他说，我心里想，现在来吧，我要用快乐来测试你，看看什么是好的。所以我试着用酒来欢愉自己，拥抱愚昧。我想看看人在天之下的短暂生命中做什么是值得的。

**快乐是一个谜题。快乐是一个问题，快乐中有很多指向。**

### 快乐为何失败

现在，有一件事很重要要理解，天哪，这非常有力。这不是一个普通的人。不是的。第10节，我没有拒绝我眼睛所欲望的任何东西。那是什么？我没有拒绝我眼睛所欲望的任何东西。

> “快乐最终让我们失望。”

**它未能提供值得的意义。**

### 快乐如何指向更远

他使万物各按其时成为美好，又将永恒安置在世人心里。然而，人不能参透神从始至终的作为。

**我们在寻找超越，而它在这方面将彻底失败。**
