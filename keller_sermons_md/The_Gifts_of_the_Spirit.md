### Introduction: Who is the Holy Spirit?

Who is the Holy Spirit? And why is the Spirit's work so vital to the Christian life? The Bible tells us the Holy Spirit is not just a vague force, but a person who works in the lives of Christians in profound ways. Today Tim Keller is exploring how the Spirit calls us to faith, unites us together, equips us with gifts, and shapes us to be more like Christ.

Our scripture reading this morning is from Ephesians 4 verses 7 through 16.

> "But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it. This is why it says, when he ascended on high, he led captives in his train and gave gifts to men. What does he ascended mean, except that he also descended to the lower earthly regions? He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens in order to fill the whole universe. It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers to prepare God's people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. Then we will no longer be infants tossed back and forth by the waves and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the head that is Christ. From him, the whole body joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love as each part does its work."

This is the word of the Lord.

### Part One: What are Spiritual Gifts?

Now in our series on the Holy Spirit, we come to the subject of what the Bible calls the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and you know, coming up on a good 40 years really in Christian ministry, I know you wouldn't know that to look at me, but coming up on 40 years, I've seen the pendulum in the church swing to such extreme places over the subject of spiritual gifts. From obsessive focus on them to ignoring them, and I think we are going to see that there is nothing more practical for helping us understand what a Christian church would actually look like concretely on the ground than to embrace what the Bible gives us here – a theology of spiritual gifts.

So if we can avoid the extremes, we are going to learn a lot about what we should look like. If this is your church, what this church should look like, if you come from some other church, what your church there should look like.

Let's ask three questions of the text. What are spiritual gifts? Then what are the practical implications of the theology of spiritual gifts? What are the implications for church life? And thirdly, how can we rightly use spiritual gifts?

#### 1. Definition of Spiritual Gifts

First, what are they? Let me give you a definition drawn from years of thinking about what the Bible says about it. The definition is spiritual gifts are differing abilities given by a Holy Spirit to each believer to meet needs in such a way that it creates a community of people who are growing into the fullness of the character of Jesus Christ.

Let me break that down into three parts for you.

- **Spiritual gifts are abilities to meet needs.** There are five lists of spiritual gifts in the Bible. There's actually one in Romans 12, there's two in 1 Corinthians 12, there's this one here in Ephesians 4, there's one in 1 Peter 4, and every one of the lists is really quite different. And it's pretty clear that each one is not exhaustive, it's illustrative, and even if you put them all together, we don't have all the gifts listed.

- **Spiritual gifts are different and yet given to every believer.** See, it says, to each Christ has given a portion of the Spirit's power to meet needs. In spite of the fact that we're all one, fundamentally in Christ, spiritual gifts create enormous diversity, not only as we're going to see this as we go along.

- **The goal of spiritual gifts is Christ's likeness.** What is the goal of spiritual gifts? What is the goal of ministry? Paul's sentences are very long, and they're even longer than they appear in the English, because in English translators usually break his sentences into several sentences to make a little bit clearer.

### Part Two: Practical Implications of Spiritual Gifts

Secondly, now, if that's true, there's your theology. What are some of the practical implications of that? What's that going to do? What kind of church does that create?

#### 1. No Passive Christians

The first one is, it means there will not be any passive unemployed Christians in a church. If this theology is embraced, there will not be any passive unemployed people in a church.

#### 2. Expect Contention

It also means we ought to expect, and I already kind of hinted at this, we ought to expect a certain amount of contention and conflict in the church because of spiritual gifts.

#### 3. Destroy Jealousy and Pride

Nevertheless, a theology of the Holy Spirit though creates a certain amount of contention. Should destroy jealousy and pride.

#### 4. Fruit Over Gifts

Lastly, the last implication, though, of this theology of spiritual gifts is not just is, in a sense, we're getting there, fruit, spiritual fruit has got to be the real goal and spiritual gifts have got to be seen only as the means.

### Part Three: How to Use Spiritual Gifts Rightly

Now that brings us to our last point and here's what we see, we're on the verge of needing this last point. How can we use our spiritual gifts rightly?

I like to show you, I just did show you, that there's all kinds of ways in which the exercise of spiritual gifts is problematic. It can lead to power struggles and jealousy. In some case, it leads to passivity because people just don't embrace the theology at all.

The answer is one word. You see it here and you certainly see it in 1 Corinthians when Paul talks about it. It's the word love.

Notice, verse 15 and 16, the whole point is, speaking the truth in love, we'll build ourselves up into the fullness of Christ. When every part of the body is doing its thing rightly, the body builds itself up in love over and over, Paul never gets the spiritual gifts without talking about love.

> "If you're passive and not using your gifts, that's just a lack of love, you're being selfish."

How do you get that love? You have to go to the part of the passage, which was the one part when it was read to you that you didn't understand at all. That's the key.

> "To each one of us grace has been given as Christ a portion of it."

Whenever I've read this over the years, I read verse 7, then I get down to verse 11, which makes sense again, and you keep reading. What is all this?

In ancient times, if the king was in his city, and there was an enemy coming to invade and enslave everyone, the king would go out to fight the enemy. If he won, if he delivered his people from oppression and captivity, he would return triumphantly, and he would go back to his throne, he would ascend his throne, and sit down so his presence was again in the midst of the people, and he would give gifts.

> "David brought the ark of the covenant. He brought the presence of God to the people at the risk of his life, but Jesus Christ did it at the cost of his life."

Jesus descended. He lost everything. There's love. And there's the love that you need.

Unless you are melted by and shaped by, and profoundly changed by, a knowledge of that love. He did all that for you. All that for you. You are not able to really minister your spiritual gifts properly. But see that and you can.

So in the end, do you want to exercise your spiritual gifts rightly? Number one, you've got to have the Holy Spirit. You've got to be a Christian. You have to believe the gospel. You can't use your spiritual gifts if you don't have the Spirit.

Number two, how do I identify my spiritual gifts? Not as hard as you think. Try a lot of different kinds of ministries and then consult your own heart and consult the church, consult the people around you.

But thirdly, look at Jesus. Look at this guy. Look at this perfect man in the gospels. See something so beautiful. See his character. See his holiness and yet his love. See his forgiveness and yet his strength and boldness. See that and say, I don't want to just be happy anymore. I want to be like him. And I want all the people that I love around me to be like him. And now use your spiritual gifts. Now it's safe.

Let us pray.

Thank you, Father, for giving us this great theology of spiritual gifts. And we pray that we here in New York City would embrace it. So we've been either passive and are proud. So we would be constantly recognizing the wonderful chaos of spiritual gifts, but at the same time, the knowledge that you have appointed, what you've appointed, keeps us, keeps our pride down, makes us humble, makes us able to listen to other people. Most of all, oh Lord, we want to use our gifts to bear spiritual fruit in people's lives. And we ask that you would help us never forget that. Never forget our eyes filled with, we don't want to be star-eyed about gifts. What we really want is we want to see Christ's likeness grow in our own hearts and the hearts of the people around us. Make us a church in which that is what happens. We pray in Jesus' name, amen.

### 引言：圣灵是谁？

圣灵是谁？为什么圣灵的工作对基督徒的生活如此重要？圣经告诉我们，圣灵不仅仅是一个模糊的力量，而是一个在基督徒生活中以深刻方式工作的位格。今天，Tim Keller 探讨圣灵如何呼召我们信仰，将我们联合在一起，赋予我们恩赐，并塑造我们更像基督。

我们今天早上的经文是以弗所书 4 章 7 到 16 节。

> “我们各人蒙恩，都是照基督所量给各人的恩赐。因此经上说：‘他升上高天的时候，掳掠了仇敌，将各样的恩赐赏给人。’既说升上，岂不是先降在地下吗？那降下的，就是远升诸天之上要充满万有的。他所赐的有使徒，有先知，有传福音的，有牧师和教师，为要成全圣徒，各尽其职，建立基督的身体，直等到我们众人在真道上同归于一，认识神的儿子，得以长大成人，满有基督长成的身量。使我们不再作小孩子，中了人的诡计和欺骗的法术，被一切异教之风摇动，飘来飘去，就随从各样的异端。惟用爱心说诚实话，凡事长进，连于元首基督。全身都靠他联络得合式，百节各按各职，照着各体的功用彼此相助，便叫身体渐渐增长，在爱中建立自己。”

这是主的话。

### 第一部分：什么是属灵的恩赐？

现在，在我们关于圣灵的系列中，我们来到圣经所称的圣灵的恩赐这个主题，你知道，在基督教事工中即将迎来 40 年，我知道你不会从外表看出来，但即将迎来 40 年，我看到教会在属灵恩赐这个主题上摆动到极端的地方。从对它们的过度关注到忽视它们，我认为我们将看到，没有什么比拥抱圣经在这里给我们的东西——属灵恩赐的神学，更能帮助我们理解基督教会在地面上实际应该是什么样子。

所以如果我们能避免极端，我们将学到很多关于我们应该是什么样子的东西。如果这是你的教会，这个教会应该是什么样子，如果你来自其他教会，你那里的教会应该是什么样子。

让我们向文本提出三个问题。什么是属灵的恩赐？然后，属灵恩赐的神学的实际意义是什么？对教会生活的意义是什么？第三，我们如何正确使用属灵的恩赐？

#### 1. 属灵恩赐的定义

首先，它们是什么？让我给你一个从多年思考圣经对它的描述中得出的定义。定义是，属灵恩赐是圣灵赋予每个信徒的不同能力，以满足需求，从而创造一个成长为耶稣基督品格丰满的人的社区。

让我为你分解成三个部分。

- **属灵恩赐是满足需求的能力。** 圣经中有五个属灵恩赐的列表。实际上，罗马书 12 章有一个，哥林多前书 12 章有两个，这里在以弗所书 4 章有一个，彼得前书 4 章有一个，每一个列表都非常不同。很明显，每一个都不是详尽无遗的，而是说明性的，即使你把它们全部放在一起，我们也没有列出所有的恩赐。

- **属灵恩赐是不同的，但却赋予每个信徒。** 看，它说，基督给每个人一部分圣灵的能力来满足需求。尽管我们在基督里基本上是一个，属灵恩赐创造了巨大的多样性，不仅是我们将要看到的。

- **属灵恩赐的目标是基督的样式。** 属灵恩赐的目标是什么？事工的目标是什么？保罗的句子很长，实际上比它们在英语中出现的还要长，因为英语译者通常将他的句子分成几个句子以使其更清晰。

### 第二部分：属灵恩赐的实际意义

其次，如果这是真的，那就是你的神学。这有什么实际意义？这会创造什么样的教会？

#### 1. 没有被动的基督徒

第一个是，这意味着在教会中不会有任何被动的失业基督徒。如果这个神学被接受，教会中就不会有任何被动的失业者。

#### 2. 期待争论

这也意味着我们应该期待，我已经暗示过这一点，我们应该期待教会中因为属灵恩赐而产生的一定程度的争论和冲突。

#### 3. 消除嫉妒和骄傲

尽管如此，圣灵的神学虽然创造了一定程度的争论。应该消除嫉妒和骄傲。

#### 4. 以果实为重

最后，这个属灵恩赐神学的最后一个意义不仅是，在某种意义上，我们正在接近，果实，属灵果实必须是真正的目标，而属灵恩赐必须被视为仅仅是手段。

### 第三部分：如何正确使用属灵恩赐

现在，这将我们带到最后一点，这就是我们看到的，我们正处于需要最后一点的边缘。我们如何正确使用属灵恩赐？

我想向你展示，我刚刚展示了，属灵恩赐的行使有各种各样的问题。它可能导致权力斗争和嫉妒。在某些情况下，它导致被动，因为人们根本不接受神学。

答案是一个词。你在这里看到它，你当然在保罗谈论它的哥林多前书中看到它。这个词是爱。

注意，第 15 和 16 节，整个重点是，用爱心说诚实话，我们将自己建立在基督的丰满中。当身体的每个部分都正确地做它的事情时，身体就会在爱中建立自己，保罗一次又一次地谈论属灵恩赐时，总是谈论爱。

> “如果你被动而不使用你的恩赐，那只是缺乏爱，你是自私的。”

你如何获得那种爱？你必须去到经文的部分，那是当它被读给你时你完全不理解的部分。那是关键。

> “我们各人蒙恩，都是照基督所量给各人的恩赐。”

多年来，每当我读到这段经文时，我读到第 7 节，然后我读到第 11 节，这又有意义了，然后你继续阅读。这一切是什么？

在古代，如果国王在他的城市里，并且有敌人要来入侵并奴役所有人，国王就会出去与敌人作战。如果他赢了，如果他解救了他的人民免于压迫和囚禁，他将凯旋而归，他将回到他的王位，他将升上他的王位，并坐下，这样他的存在再次在人民中间，然后他会给予礼物。

> “大卫带来了约柜。他冒着生命危险将神的同在带给人民，但耶稣基督却以生命的代价这样做。”

耶稣降下。他失去了一切。那就是爱。那就是你需要的爱。

除非你被这种爱融化、塑造，并被深刻地改变。他为你做了这一切。为你做了这一切。你无法真正正确地施展你的属灵恩赐。但看到这一点，你就可以。

所以最后，你想正确地施展你的属灵恩赐吗？首先，你必须拥有圣灵。你必须是基督徒。你必须相信福音。如果你没有圣灵，你就不能使用你的属灵恩赐。

第二，我如何识别我的属灵恩赐？并不像你想象的那么难。尝试各种不同类型的事工，然后咨询你自己的心，咨询教会，咨询你周围的人。

但第三，看耶稣。看这个人。看福音书中的这个完美的人。看到如此美丽的东西。看到他的品格。看到他的圣洁，但又看到他的爱。看到他的宽恕，但又看到他的力量和勇气。看到这一点，然后说，我不再只是想要快乐。我想像他一样。我希望我周围所有我爱的人都像他一样。现在使用你的属灵恩赐。现在是安全的。

让我们祈祷。

感谢父神，赐给我们这个伟大的属灵恩赐神学。我们祈祷，我们在纽约市会接受它。所以我们要么被动，要么骄傲。所以我们会不断认识到属灵恩赐的美妙混乱，但同时，你所指定的知识，保持我们的骄傲，使我们谦卑，使我们能够倾听他人。最重要的是，哦主，我们想用我们的恩赐在人的生命中结出属灵的果实。我们请求你帮助我们永远不要忘记这一点。永远不要让我们的眼睛充满，我们不想对恩赐充满星星眼。我们真正想要的是看到基督的样式在我们自己的心中和我们周围人的心中成长。让我们成为一个这样的教会。我们奉耶稣的名祈祷，阿门。
