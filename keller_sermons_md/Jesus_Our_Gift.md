### Introduction: Who is Jesus?

Who is Jesus? The Bible says He's fully God, the creator of the universe, and at the same time, fully human. Lose one of those and you lose Christianity. Join us for today's podcast where Tim Keller explores the person and promises of Jesus Christ.

One verse and a place in the scripture that you usually don't read from on Christmas, but it's a great Christmas verse. It's Romans 8:32. I'm just going to read one verse and I'll read it twice. It's not printed in the bulletin. Everything else in the Bible is printed in the bulletin, but not Romans 8:32. And that's where Paul writes, **he who did not spare his own son but gave him up for us all. How will he not also along with him graciously give us all things?**

> "He who did not spare his own son but gave him up for us all. How will he not also along with him graciously give us all things?"

That's God's word.

### The Gift of Jesus

It's a Christmas time that we give gifts. In fact, it's the only holiday in which we do all this gift giving. It's the reason why retailers are so happy with Christmas in a way they're not happy with 4th of July, for example, or Easter. You see, at the other holidays, we don't give gifts. In fact, even at birthdays and weddings and anniversaries, we all give gifts to one, but at Christmas, we all give gifts to all. Why do we do that?

It's a great custom because what it does is it takes and you might say incarnates, it acts out the central event of Christmas. The central event of Christmas is that Jesus Christ was not just born. Jesus is the one great person who wasn't simply born. The teaching of the Scripture, the teaching of the Bible, of course, is that he had an existence before he was born. Therefore, Jesus was not just born, he was given to us. He's the gift that Christmas is about.

And you see what Paul says, **he who did not spare his own son but gave him up for us all. How will he not also along with him graciously give us all things?** This is the one gift. If you have it, you have all the other gifts. That's what Paul's saying. This is the one gift. If you reject it, you lose all other gifts. That's what Paul's saying.

### Qualities of a Gift

#### Surprise

Now I'd like to just point out three things, just point out three things that gifts are, and therefore Jesus is. And by thinking about Jesus as a gift, I think we'll come to understand better who he is and how we should relate to him.

Now first of all, now I'm not saying all gifts have these three qualities, but the best gifts do. And therefore what's essential to being a gift has a great deal to do with these three facets, so these three qualities are traits.

1. **Gifts are surprises, a good gift, the best gifts are unexpected.** They're a surprise. Now it doesn't mean that all gifts have to be a surprise, and some great gifts sometimes are not a surprise, but the power and the delight. The giftness of the gift is greatly enhanced when it's not, when something that surprises you. And of course, a surprise by definition is something you don't expect.

2. **The quintessential language of a person who's just had a great gift, has just experienced a great gift. The quintessential language is, I didn't expect it. I wasn't even looking for it, but it's exactly what I need.**

#### Insulting

Secondly, in certain contexts, gifts can be insulting. We said gifts are always surprising. Sometimes gifts are insulting. Well, it depends on the gift, you know. I'll tell you, let me give you a great example of where it might happen. You're going to get your paycheck and your employer has your paycheck, let's say. He says, yes, here it is. Here's what we usually, you know, we always pay you every month or every two weeks. But I want you to know that this particular pay period, this is a gift. Here, Merry Christmas. And you know, that would be an insult.

#### Immensely Valuable

Lastly, Jesus Christ is immensely valuable, all gifts, really great gifts. You look at them, you know, the best gifts are the gifts that you look at and you say, I never, ever would have bought this for myself. In fact, the best gifts are the ones in which you realize I never, ever could have bought this for myself. I couldn't have afforded this. This is wonderful, you say. Those are the best gifts. They're surprising, but they're also tremendously valuable and you look at them and the joy just wells up the more you're able to appreciate, the more you're able to see the value of it.

What have you got in Jesus? You've got God with us. You have Emmanuel as you were singing.

> "Thanks be to God for His inexpressible gift."

Let's pray.

Thank you, Father, that you are a God who enables us and allows us to come into your presence as a gift. We pray that you would help us see that we can trust you. For if you did not spare your own son, how should we fail to trust you for everything else? You're going to give us anything we need. So we pray, Lord, that you will help us to see that in Jesus Christ we have all the gifts we need. And I pray that the words that we looked at tonight and the teaching and the truths that we looked at tonight would be applied by your spirit to every person here individually, that no one would leave without having a deeper understanding and a desire to drink deep, to look even more deeply into the wonders of this inexpressible gift Jesus Christ and whose name we pray. Amen.

### 引言：耶稣是谁？

耶稣是谁？圣经说他是完全的神，宇宙的创造者，同时又是完全的人。失去其中一个，你就失去了基督教。加入我们今天的播客，蒂姆·凯勒将探讨耶稣基督的人物和应许。

有一节经文和一个你通常不会在圣诞节读的经文出处，但它是一个很好的圣诞节经文。那是罗马书8:32。我只会读一节经文，我会读两次。它没有印在公告上。圣经中的其他一切都印在公告上，但不是罗马书8:32。保罗写道，**他既不爱惜自己的儿子为我们众人舍了，岂不也把万物和他一同白白地赐给我们吗？**

> "他既不爱惜自己的儿子为我们众人舍了，岂不也把万物和他一同白白地赐给我们吗？"

这是上帝的话。

### 耶稣的礼物

这是一个我们送礼物的圣诞节。事实上，这是我们进行所有这些送礼活动的唯一节日。这也是为什么零售商对圣诞节如此高兴的原因，而不是对例如7月4日或复活节感到高兴。你看，在其他节日，我们不送礼物。事实上，即使在生日、婚礼和周年纪念日，我们都只送礼物给一个人，但在圣诞节，我们都送礼物给所有人。我们为什么这样做？

这是一个伟大的习俗，因为它使圣诞节的核心事件具体化。圣诞节的核心事件是耶稣基督不仅仅是出生。耶稣是唯一一个不仅仅是出生的伟大人物。圣经的教导，当然是他在出生之前就有存在。因此，耶稣不仅仅是出生，他是被赐给我们的。他是圣诞节的礼物。

你看保罗怎么说，**他既不爱惜自己的儿子为我们众人舍了，岂不也把万物和他一同白白地赐给我们吗？** 这是唯一的礼物。如果你拥有它，你就拥有所有其他的礼物。这就是保罗所说的。这是唯一的礼物。如果你拒绝它，你就失去了所有其他的礼物。这就是保罗所说的。

### 礼物的特质

#### 惊喜

现在我想指出三件事，只是指出三件事，礼物是什么，因此耶稣是什么。通过把耶稣看作礼物，我想我们会更好地理解他是谁以及我们应该如何与他相处。

首先，我不是说所有的礼物都有这三个特质，但最好的礼物确实有。因此，作为礼物的本质与这三个方面有很大关系，所以这三个特质是特征。

1. **礼物是惊喜，一个好的礼物，最好的礼物是意想不到的。** 它们是一个惊喜。现在这并不意味着所有的礼物都必须是一个惊喜，有时一些伟大的礼物并不是一个惊喜，但礼物的力量和快乐在于它不是，当它是一个惊喜的时候。并且当然，惊喜的定义是你不期望的东西。

2. **一个刚刚经历过伟大礼物的人，刚刚体验过伟大礼物的人的典型语言是，我没有期望它。我甚至没有寻找它，但它正是我需要的。**

#### 侮辱

其次，在某些情况下，礼物可能是侮辱。我们说礼物总是令人惊讶的。有时礼物是侮辱。嗯，这取决于礼物，你知道。我告诉你，让我给你一个可能发生的好例子。你要去领工资，你的雇主有你的工资单，比如说。他说，是的，这里是。这是我们通常，你知道，我们每个月或每两周总是支付给你的。但我想让你知道，这个特定的支付期，这是一个礼物。这里，圣诞快乐。你知道，那将是一个侮辱。

#### 极其珍贵

最后，耶稣基督是极其珍贵的，所有的礼物，真正伟大的礼物。你看着它们，你知道，最好的礼物是你看着它们，你说，我从来没有想过会为自己买这个。事实上，最好的礼物是你意识到我从来没有想过会为自己买这个。我买不起这个。这太棒了，你说。那些是最好的礼物。它们是惊喜，但它们也非常有价值，你看着它们，快乐就涌上心头，越能欣赏它，越能看到它的价值。

你在耶稣身上得到了什么？你得到了与我们同在的上帝。你有以马内利，正如你在唱歌时所唱的。

> "感谢上帝赐下他那无法形容的礼物。"

让我们祷告。

感谢你，父亲，你是一个允许我们进入你面前的上帝。我们祈求你帮助我们看到我们可以信任你。因为如果你不爱惜自己的儿子，我们怎么能不信任你给我们其他一切呢？你会给我们任何我们需要的东西。所以我们祈求，主，你会帮助我们看到在耶稣基督里我们拥有所有我们需要的礼物。我祈求今晚我们所看的话语和教导以及我们所看的真理会被你的灵应用于这里的每一个人，没有人会离开而没有更深的理解和渴望深入，甚至更深入地了解这个无法形容的礼物耶稣基督，我们以他的名祷告。阿门。
