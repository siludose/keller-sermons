### Introduction: The Importance of Wisdom

Welcome to the Gospel Unliked Podcast. Many of the questions we face in life are complex and aren't always answered by simply following rules. Do I speak up now or do I wait? Should I take that job or stay where I am? That's why wisdom is so crucial. But how do we develop it? Today join us as Tim Keller explores how we apply God's wisdom to the everyday complexities of our lives.

> "As you listen to today's teaching, we invite you to go online to gospelunlife.com and sign up for email updates."

**Wisdom is crucial for navigating life's complexities.**

### Part One: The Path of Wisdom

#### 1. The Nature of Wisdom

So we're going to short series on the early chapters of the book of Proverbs. We're just doing three weeks here right after Labor Day and Proverbs is about wisdom. We live in a culture in which there's more choices than there ever have been and we also live in a city in which there's an enormous number of choices. What you need in order to make good choices is wisdom.

- Moral values are important.
- Wisdom is knowing what the right thing is to do in the 80% of life situations that the moral rules don't directly apply to.

#### 2. The Metaphor of the Path

There's a metaphor all through the book of Proverbs, actually all through the Bible, but all through the book of Proverbs. You see it in verse six, it says, do this, do this, do this, and he will make your path straight. No, that's not that hard to understand as a metaphor, what does that mean? God will make your path straight, that means he'll make your life go well.

> "Your life is being likened to a pathway, and therefore living your life is being likened to walking a path."

**Actions you take repeatedly, day after day, in your ordinary daily life make you something.**

### Part Two: Developing Wisdom

#### 1. Knowing God

First of all, knowing God. Look at verse three, but love and faithfulness never leave you. Bind them around your neck and write them on the tablet of your heart. Now, this is not an easy text to understand immediately because when we read it in English, it looks like it's saying be a loving, faithful person, right, but love and faithfulness never leave you.

- God's love and faithfulness are crucial.
- You need to be absolutely convinced of and never lose your grasp of His unconditional gracious love for you.

#### 2. Trusting God

Secondly, though, look at this, verse 5, trust in the Lord with all your heart. Now, I'm afraid when you hear that right away, you just start to feel inspired. Trust in the Lord with all your heart. It sounds like a hallmark reading card and, you know, oh, how nice. But it actually has got an edge to it.

- It's possible to believe in God, but to trust something else for your real significance, for your real security.

### Part Three: The Catalyst for Wisdom

#### 1. The Role of Suffering

Now, the image isn't hard to see. It's talking about a father disciplining a son. Well, what is the father who's disciplining a son do? The father brings into the son's life painful things, things that are hard, things that are difficult, things that are painful, things that make the child cry usually.

> "Nobody ever gets wise without really bad things happening to them."

**Suffering can either make you wiser or stupider.**

#### 2. The Assurance of God's Delight

How can you be sure? How can anybody be sure? In the New Testament, these two verses, 11 and 12 are picked up and put down in Hebrews chapter 12. There it says, my son, do not make a light of the Lord's discipline. Don't lose heart when he rebukes you.

- Jesus' suffering assures us of God's love.
- Trust in God's delight in you during suffering.

**Let us pray. Our Father, we want to become wise. No, we want to become like Jesus in whom all the treasures of knowledge and wisdom are hid.**

### Conclusion

And therefore, we pray that you would help us to look to what Jesus did on the cross for us. And therefore, seeing that proof that you delighted us, go through the ups and downs of life, knowing you, trusting in you, submitting to your word, and living with our Christian brothers and sisters, and getting in the community, and becoming more and more conformed to the image of your Son and his name we pray. Amen.

### 引言：智慧的重要性

欢迎来到《福音不受欢迎》播客。我们生活中面临的许多问题都很复杂，并不是简单地遵循规则就能解决的。我现在该发声还是等待？我应该接受那份工作还是留在原地？这就是为什么智慧如此重要。但我们如何培养智慧呢？今天，请加入我们，听听 Tim Keller 探讨如何将上帝的智慧应用于我们生活中的日常复杂性。

> "在您收听今天的教导时，我们邀请您访问 gospelunlife.com 并注册电子邮件更新。"

**智慧对于驾驭生活的复杂性至关重要。**

### 第一部分：智慧之路

#### 1. 智慧的本质

我们将进行一个关于箴言书早期章节的小系列。我们在劳动节后只进行三周，箴言是关于智慧的。我们生活在一个选择比以往任何时候都多的文化中，我们也生活在一个选择众多的城市中。为了做出好的选择，你需要智慧。

- 道德价值观很重要。
- 智慧是在道德规则不直接适用的 80% 的生活情境中知道正确的事情是什么。

#### 2. 道路的隐喻

在整个箴言书中，实际上在整个圣经中都有一个隐喻，但在整个箴言书中尤为明显。你在第六节中看到它，它说，做这个，做这个，做这个，他会使你的道路平直。这并不难理解作为一个隐喻，这是什么意思？上帝会使你的道路平直，这意味着他会让你的生活顺利。

> "你的生活被比作一条道路，因此生活被比作走一条路。"

**你每天反复采取的行动使你成为某种人。**

### 第二部分：培养智慧

#### 1. 认识上帝

首先，认识上帝。看看第三节，但爱和信实永不离开你。把它们系在你的脖子上，写在你心的石板上。现在，这不是一个容易立即理解的文本，因为当我们用英语阅读它时，它看起来像是在说成为一个有爱心、忠诚的人，对吧，但爱和信实永不离开你。

- 上帝的爱和信实至关重要。
- 你需要绝对确信并永远不要失去对他无条件恩典之爱的把握。

#### 2. 信靠上帝

其次，看这个，第五节，全心信靠耶和华。现在，我担心当你听到这个时，你会立即感到受到启发。全心信靠耶和华。听起来像是一张贺卡，你知道，哦，多好。但它实际上有一个锋利的边缘。

- 可能相信上帝，但信任其他东西来获得真正的意义和安全感。

### 第三部分：智慧的催化剂

#### 1. 苦难的角色

现在，这个形象并不难理解。它谈论的是父亲管教儿子。那么，管教儿子的父亲做什么？父亲在儿子的生活中带来痛苦的事情，困难的事情，痛苦的事情，通常让孩子哭泣的事情。

> "没有人能在没有经历真正糟糕的事情的情况下变得聪明。"

**苦难可以让你变得更聪明或更愚蠢。**

#### 2. 上帝喜悦的保证

你怎么能确定？任何人怎么能确定？在新约中，这两节经文，11 和 12 节被引用并放在希伯来书第 12 章中。那里说，我的儿子，不要轻看主的管教，也不要因他责备你而灰心。

- 耶稣的苦难确保了我们上帝的爱。
- 在苦难中信靠上帝对你的喜悦。

**让我们祷告。我们的父，我们想变得聪明。不，我们想变得像耶稣，在他里面隐藏着所有知识和智慧的宝藏。**

### 结论

因此，我们祈求您帮助我们看到耶稣在十字架上为我们所做的。因此，看到您对我们的喜悦的证明，经历生活的起伏，认识您，信靠您，顺服您的话语，与我们的基督徒弟兄姐妹生活在一起，进入社区，越来越多地被塑造成您儿子的形象，以他的名义我们祈祷。阿门。
