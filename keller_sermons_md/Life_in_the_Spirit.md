### Introduction: Who is the Holy Spirit?

Who is the Holy Spirit? And why is the Spirit's work so vital to the Christian life? The Bible tells us the Holy Spirit is not just a vague force, but a person who works in the lives of Christians in profound ways. Today Tim Keller is exploring how the Spirit calls us to faith, unites us together, equips us with gifts and shapes us to be more like Christ. Our scripture tonight comes from the Book of Ephesians, chapter 5 verses 15 through 21.

> Be very careful then how you live, not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity because the days are evil. Therefore, do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is. Do not get drunk on wine which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit. Speak to one another with Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord, always giving thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Submit to one another out of reverence, poor Christ.

This is the Word of the Lord. It's good to be with you back with you in order to look at this famous command by Paul. He commands us to be filled with the Spirit. He doesn't say it would be a great thing to attain if you could. Try real hard, maybe you'll make it. **He commands, be filled with the Spirit.**

### Part One: What is being filled with the Spirit?

#### 1. The Comparison with Drunkenness

Paul makes a comparison and a contrast. He says, don't be drunk with wine, but be filled with the Spirit. By the way, most commentators say that's rather surprising. Why in the world that he brings getting drunk up? Why would he say, don't be drunk with wine, but be filled with the Spirit? And the answer is, there must be some way in which being drunk is like being filled with the Spirit and some way in which it's unlike.

- **Similarity:** In Acts chapter 2, the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit fell on the disciples, and they began to speak with boldness and joy. The onlookers thought they were drunk because they were so brave and happy.
- **Dissimilarity:** Alcohol makes you brave and happy by depressing your brain and showing you less of reality. The fullness of the Spirit operates in exactly the opposite way.

#### 2. The Fullness of the Spirit

Paul is seeking a higher level of mental functioning. Verse 18, be filled with the Spirit. Because the fullness of the Spirit, unlike alcohol, doesn't make you brave and happy by showing you less of reality but by showing you more.

> Elisha, the great prophet, 2 Kings chapter 6. He was in a city with his servant, and the city was surrounded by enemies. Elisha had confidence, courage, and joy, and the servant was melting down with fear. Elisha prayed to God and said, oh Lord, open his eyes. Show him all of reality.

### Part Two: How do we know if we are filled with the Spirit?

#### 1. Marks of the Spirit

Usually, when people teach or preach on being filled with the Spirit, they start with verse 18. I rather deliberately included verses 15, 16, 17, their run-up. And the reason I did is because there you have Paul talking about wisdom and then saying, now, if you want wisdom, be filled with the Spirit.

- **Humble Realism:** Wisdom means to be down to earth, realistic, not idealistic.
- **Surging Joy:** Spiritual joy is accompanied by a humble realism.

> Paul says, in 2 Corinthians 6, we're sorrowful yet always rejoicing. We're poor yet we possess everything.

### Part Three: How can we become filled with the Spirit?

#### 1. The Example of Jesus

Jesus exalted, exploded with joy in the Holy Spirit. Jesus has an experience of the fullness of the Spirit. And this is what it says. This is Luke chapter 10.

> At that time, Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Ghost, exalted and said, I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the learned and revealed them to little children.

#### 2. The Role of Grace

Jesus looked at the gospel. He looked at grace and it filled him with the Holy Spirit. Now look, Jesus is perfect. Jesus is right with God. Why would Jesus need the fullness of the Holy Spirit? All I know is that even Jesus needed the fullness of the Holy Spirit to get through his life, to face the things he was facing.

- **Look at Grace:** Look at what Jesus Christ has done systematically, thematically in a disciplined way until you can say, I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth that you are God of grace and you've been a God of grace to me.

Let's pray, our Father, we are so grateful that you're a God of grace and you don't divide the world into the good and the bad but you divide the world into the proud and the helpless. The people who don't think they need grace and the people who do know that they need grace. And we thank you that you have been willing to come into our lives, but we also know that we don't experience this humble realism in searching joy, this heightened supernaturally charged cognition. We have not made ourselves available to it and we ask that your Holy Spirit would fill us. Fill us. And that we go on being filled with your Spirit so that we also can become a congregation of people who sing to one another and speak to one another and build each other up in love. So, Father, help us to apply all these things through the inspiration of your Holy Spirit in the name of Jesus we ask it. Amen.

### 引言：圣灵是谁？

圣灵是谁？为什么圣灵的工作对基督徒的生活如此重要？圣经告诉我们，圣灵不仅仅是一个模糊的力量，而是一个在基督徒生活中以深刻方式工作的位格。今天，Tim Keller 探讨圣灵如何呼召我们信仰，将我们联合在一起，装备我们以恩赐，并塑造我们更像基督。今晚的经文来自以弗所书，第五章第15至21节。

> 所以你们要谨慎行事，不要像愚昧人，当像智慧人。要爱惜光阴，因为现今的世代邪恶。不要作糊涂人，要明白主的旨意如何。不要醉酒，酒能使人放荡，乃要被圣灵充满。要用诗章、颂词、灵歌彼此对说，口唱心和地赞美主。凡事要奉我们主耶稣基督的名常常感谢父神。又当存敬畏基督的心，彼此顺服。

这是主的话语。很高兴能和你们一起回顾保罗的这个著名命令。他命令我们要被圣灵充满。他没有说如果你能达到那会是件好事。努力尝试，也许你会成功。**他命令，要被圣灵充满。**

### 第一部分：什么是被圣灵充满？

#### 1. 与醉酒的比较

保罗做了一个比较和对比。他说，不要醉酒，而要被圣灵充满。顺便说一下，大多数评论家说这相当令人惊讶。他为什么提到醉酒？为什么他说，不要醉酒，而要被圣灵充满？答案是，醉酒和被圣灵充满在某种程度上是相似的，也在某种程度上是不相似的。

- **相似之处：** 在使徒行传第二章，五旬节那天，圣灵降临在门徒身上，他们开始以勇气和喜乐说话。旁观者认为他们喝醉了，因为他们如此勇敢和快乐。
- **不同之处：** 酒精通过抑制大脑功能让你勇敢和快乐，显示给你更少的现实。圣灵的充满则完全相反。

#### 2. 圣灵的充满

保罗寻求更高水平的精神功能。第18节，被圣灵充满。因为圣灵的充满，不像酒精，不是通过显示更少的现实让你勇敢和快乐，而是通过显示更多的现实。

> 以利沙，这位伟大的先知，列王记下第六章。他和他的仆人在一个被敌军包围的城市中。以利沙有信心、勇气和喜乐，而仆人则因恐惧而崩溃。以利沙向神祷告说，哦主啊，打开他的眼睛。显示给他所有的现实。

### 第二部分：我们如何知道是否被圣灵充满？

#### 1. 圣灵的标志

通常，当人们教导或讲述被圣灵充满时，他们从第18节开始。我故意包括了第15、16、17节的引言。因为在那里保罗谈到智慧，然后说，如果你想要智慧，就要被圣灵充满。

- **谦卑的现实主义：** 智慧意味着脚踏实地，现实主义，不是理想主义。
- **涌动的喜乐：** 属灵的喜乐伴随着谦卑的现实主义。

> 保罗在哥林多后书第六章说，我们似乎忧愁，却常常快乐。我们似乎贫穷，却拥有一切。

### 第三部分：我们如何能被圣灵充满？

#### 1. 耶稣的榜样

耶稣在圣灵中欢欣鼓舞。耶稣经历了圣灵的充满。这是路加福音第十章所说的。

> 那时，耶稣被圣灵充满，欢欣鼓舞，说，我感谢你，父，天地的主，因为你将这些事向聪明通达人就藏起来，向婴孩就显出来。父啊，是的，因为你的美意本是如此。

#### 2. 恩典的角色

耶稣看着福音，看着恩典，圣灵充满了他。现在看，耶稣是完美的。耶稣与神是对的。为什么耶稣需要圣灵的充满？我所知道的是，即使是耶稣也需要圣灵的充满来度过他的生活，面对他所面对的事情。

- **看恩典：** 系统地、主题地、以有纪律的方式看耶稣基督所做的，直到你能说，我感谢你，父，天地的主，你是恩典的神，你对我施恩。

让我们祷告，我们的父，我们非常感激你是恩典的神，你不将世界分为好人和坏人，而是分为骄傲的人和无助的人。那些不认为他们需要恩典的人和那些知道他们需要恩典的人。我们感谢你愿意进入我们的生活，但我们也知道我们没有体验到这种谦卑的现实主义和涌动的喜乐，这种高度超自然的认知。我们没有让自己可用，我们请求你的圣灵充满我们。充满我们。并且让我们继续被你的圣灵充满，以便我们也能成为一个彼此歌唱、彼此说话、彼此在爱中建立的会众。所以，父，帮助我们通过你的圣灵的启发应用所有这些事情，我们奉耶稣的名请求。阿门。
