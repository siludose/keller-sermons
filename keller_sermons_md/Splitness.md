### Introduction: The Struggle for Change

Are you longing to see real change in your life, in your habits, your relationships, your heart? Today, Tim Keller explores how lasting change actually happens in the life of a Christian and why the Gospel offers a radically different process of transformation than anything else.

Today, Scripture reading is on page 9 in your bulletin and it comes from Romans 7 verses 1 through 9 and then 18 through 25.

> "Or do you not know, brothers, for I am speaking to those who know the law, that the law is binding on a person only as long as he lives? Thus a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of marriage. Accordingly, she will be called adulterous if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law and if she marries another man, she is not an adulteress. Likewise, my brothers, you also have died to the law through the body of Christ so that you may belong to another, to him who has been raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God. For while we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our members to bear fruit for death. But now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive so that we serve not under the old written code but in the new life of the Spirit. But then shall we say that the law is sinned by no means, yet if it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, you shall not covet. But sinned, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness. Apart from the law, sin lies dead. I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin came alive and I died. For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is in my flesh. For I have the desire to do it is right, but not the ability to carry it out. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing. Now, if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sinned that dwells within me. So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand. For I delight in the law of God in my inner being. But I see in my members another law waging more against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members, wretched man that I am, who will deliver me from the body of death. Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ, our Lord. This is God's Word."

He said last week that when I first became a Christian, there were some things in my life that profoundly needed changing, but they weren't changing. And then I read two authors, John Owen and John Stott, and in their books, they, as it were, led me to Romans 6, 7 and 8. And when I began to grasp what was taught there, that's when change, real change, began in my own life. And so I want to take you there for this brief series on Romans 6, 7 and 8, and ask the question, how does change really happen in somebody's life? How does Christ, how does faith in Christ very concretely and practically lead to change?

Last week we looked at Romans 6 as a whole, and we saw some principles. This we look at Romans 7 as a whole, in which we have in very starkly, shockingly realistic terms, a depiction of the human heart, what we really have here. And then when we get to Romans 8, Romans 6 as the principles, Romans 7 as the heart that the principles have to be applied to, and Romans 8 will take two or three weeks looking at the more practical aspects of how do you apply the principles to the heart so as to bring about change.

Now tonight I'm going to move from the beginning, the end of the beginning, we're going to look at the last part of the passage, the middle part of the passage, and then the first part of the passage. And when we look at Romans 7 like that, I think we'll learn three things. What our biggest problem is, what won't work against it, and what will. What our biggest problem is, what will not address or solve that problem, and what will.

### Part 1: Our Biggest Problem

#### 1. The Deep Splitness of the Human Heart

Paul very classically puts it in verse 18 and 19, when he says, **"I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out."** There it is. I can aspire and envision the right, but I don't find in myself the power to actually execute and do it. Why? The answer is what we'll call here, the deep splitness of the human heart, the splitness because in verse 20 he says, **"Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me."** He says, there's me, and then there's something in me, and he says, it's sin.

In fact, notice a minute in verse 19, he talks about evil. There's evil and sin residing in him, residing in us. Then notice that word dwell, very, very important. Evil and sin is not something that just acts upon us from the outside, nor is it something that comes into us temporarily and camps out, and if you know what you're doing, you can shoot it away. **It is at home in us. It dwells in us. It resides in us. It's deeply rooted in us, and as a result, there's this deep splitness about us of good and evil.**

Now the classic depiction of this in literature is Robert Louis Stevenson's book, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Now have you ever really read the book? I bet you haven't, because what we do is we see movies and plays, and I like to work off the book. It's not very long. It's like 80 pages. It's a pretty short book, but a fascinating book, and you know basically the narrative. Dr. Jekyll came to realize that he was, what he called, quote, unquote, an incongruous compound of good and evil, of conscience and coveting. And he felt that because of this, his bad nature held his good nature back, and so he could aspire to do things, but he could never follow through on them, just like Romans 7.

But he comes up with an idea, a potion. He's going to concoct the potion that will separate the two natures out from each other. And he intends to drink the potion at night to let his bad side out. But during the day when he's doing his work, he'll be his good self, and his good self will now be unencumbered. That will be free from the influence of the evil, and will be able to realize all of its goals. Nice theory. But when he takes the potion, and his bad nature side comes out to his shock, he's far more evil than he ever dared believe he was. That's the problem.

And he says in the narrative in the book, he says, **"I knew myself at the first breath of this new life, to be more wicked, tenfold more wicked than I had thought, and the thought braced and delighted me like wine. This being Edward Hyde was inherently maligned. His every act and thought centered on self."** His every act and thought centered on the self. Why is his bad side named Edward Hyde, you know why? Because of all because he was hideous. It's the hideousness, but also because he was hidden. He was hidden even from Dr. Jekyll, had no idea he was this evil.

And so when Edward Hyde hears how the narrative goes on, Edward Hyde comes out, he's far more evil than Dr. Jekyll ever thought he would be. And he starts doing terrible things, including murder. And finally, we'll get back to this in a second. Dr. Jekyll says, I'm going to try to stop it then, I'm going to try to repress this evil side, but Edward Hyde more and more gets the upper hand and more and more is in control. And when Dr. Jekyll realizes he's about to lose complete control and not even become Dr. Jekyll anymore, but permanently become Edward Hyde, he kills himself. Very, very disturbing narrative.

But right out of Roman 7, because Roman 7 is saying, and what Robert Lewis Stevenson is saying are the same thing. And that is number one, even the best people, even the most brilliant and decent Dr. Jekyll or Apostle Paul's, even the best people have at the core of their being, a hideousness, an evil, a capacity for incredible self-centeredness, because notice Robert Lewis Stevenson actually in a very biblical way defines what was so hideous about Hyde, absolute centering of every thought on the self. And it's that self-absorption and that self-centeredness and it's me, me and my needs and my interests and my desires, that incredible ability to center on the self is what leads to the evil.

So even in the very best people, there's a core of evil, a capacity for doing terrible things way beyond what you believe it to be. Far greater, far worse than you ever imagined. It's hidden from you. But sometimes there are certain situations that act as a potion, stress, temptation, marriage to a difficult person. And the real wickedness, the real capacity for evil, that incredible hideousness, that enormous, almost endless capacity for self-centeredness, self-absorption, self-will, self-indulgence comes out and then you're dead.

Do you believe this, that the very best person is capable of such awfulness and that you almost certainly, no matter what we're being taught here, is your assessment of your own capacity for evil and sin is way too small. Way too small.

Sufjan Stevens is an indie rock artist, some of you know, has a song called John Wayne Gacy. It's a song about a serial killer. John Wayne Gacy who killed 30 people and hid them under the floorboards of his house. And Sufjan sings about this serial killer and the last two lines of the song are absolutely astounding. In fact, even the village voice was blown away by the music critic there because at the very, very end he's singing about this serial killer, how awful, what a terrible person, incredible serial killer and the very last lines go like this. **"But in my best behavior, I am really just like him. Look beneath the floorboards for the secrets I have hid."** He says, look beneath the floorboards of my life and you will see the capacity to do terrible things.

Do you believe that? Do you really, do you believe what Stevenson's saying, Sufjan Stevens is saying, Robert Louis Stevenson, what Paul is saying, that in you you've got a capacity for hideousness and selfishness and evil way beyond what you really think you're capable of. But at some point you might find some situation, bring it out and then you're dead.

### Part 2: What Won't Work

#### 1. The Ineffectiveness of the Moral Law

So if that's the case and it's important to understand and that is the case, what do we do about it? Point two, the main solution that most people try to bring to bear on it, Paul says doesn't work. What is that? It has to do with the moral law.

Now when we see in here Paul talking about turning to the law and turning to the moral law, he's thinking of the mosaic law, he's a Jew, he's thinking about the ten commandments in the mosaic law. But what he says here really holds true across all the cultures. At the very end of C.S. Lewis's book, The Abolition of Man, he has an appendix which is incredibly valuable and in that appendix he compares the moral law of Confucianism and Hinduism and Buddhism and Islam and Christianity and Judaism. And he shows a remarkable convergence, a remarkable consensus about what the basic requirements that God has of us, what the basic requirements are of a moral life.

And the moral law, therefore we do understand, we do know what it is. And across all of the cultures and across all of the religions, what most people do about the fact that we have a bad nature is we take the moral law and with an enormous exercise of willpower, we apply that moral law to our bad nature. In other words, we try to wipe out our hide with our jekyll. We try to deal with our Edward hide by just being incredibly jekyll, incredibly good, incredibly obedient. We form moral communities in which we read the moral law and every week and we applaud it and we obey it and we instruct our children in it and we say by applying the moral law of God to people's lives, that is how we're going to overcome our hideousness, that selfishness, that pride, that self-centeredness that destroys people, that's how we're going to overcome it.

And Paul says, it won't work. In fact, Paul says in verse 5 something absolutely amazing. Look at verse 5. He says, **"While we were in the flesh, our sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our members to bear fruit for death."** Aroused by the law, our sinful passions aroused by the law. Paul says the law has a greenhouse effect on what's wrong with us. It doesn't shrivel it, it aggravates it, it prospers it, it grows it. You say what? Now how could that be? He's saying that applying the law of God through willpower, just insisting and bringing the law of God to bear on somebody's life and saying, this is what you have to do. This is what you have to do. This is what you have to do. It doesn't make you a better person. It makes you worse. It brings out. It aggravates what's wrong with you. How could that be?

Well at one level, nobody talks about this better than St. Augustin, by the way, St. Augustin in his famous book The Confessions reflects on an incident in his youth. In his youth at one point, he broke into a private orchard and stole some pears off a tree that weren't his, of course. And later on, he reflected theologically and profoundly actually on that incident. And he thought back on it and he said, why did I steal the pears? A, I wasn't hungry. B, if I was hungry, I didn't like pears. After he stole the pears, he threw them the pigs. He didn't even like pears, but he went and stole the pears. And he said, why did I steal the pears? I didn't even like pears. And the answer is, I stole the pears because somebody told me that they were forbidden. In other words, someone says thou shalt not take those pears. And he says until someone said thou shalt not, I had no interest in the pears. But once they said, don't take those pears, I wanted them.

There is something about the heart. Deep inside the heart, there's an aspect of our hideousness, of our self-centeredness, of that self-absorption that says nobody tells me how to live. Now there's a lot of people that that is right on the surface of your life because there's a lot of people who walk around talking like that all the time. Nobody tells me how to live my life, you see. But the rest of us, a lot of us, oh, we don't say like, we're very nice, but deep inside us, deep inside you, Mr. Ms. Jekylls, is a part of our heart that absolutely hates being told how to live. That's part of what's wrong with us. And when you bring the moral law to bear on a child or bring the moral law to bear on people, bring the moral law to bear on people, instead of it shriveling up that aspect of our beings, it actually aggravates it and people do things because they're forbidden.

But there's more to it than that. How does the law act as a greenhouse on what's wrong with us? Paul actually says in verses 8 and 9, or Paul actually gives us a little autobiographical sketch of how he moved from being a legalistic Pharisee into being a Christian. And it's not an easy sketch to grasp, it's very, very sketchy. Well, he says, I was alive apart from the law, but then one of the 10 commandments that I'll show it not covet came home and slew me. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God, even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365 day devotional, the songs of Jesus, you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start. And if you already spend time and study and prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest emotions and questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with him. We'll send you Tim and Kathy Keller's devotional as our thanks for your gift to help Gospel and Life share the love of Jesus with more people. That's your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash give.

What's that mean? Now, here's what I think it means. Paul was saying, I was alive. Now what does that mean? I was spiritually alive. What does it mean? Well, you know, we talk about a team is still alive if it's in the running for the pennant. You know? And what Paul was saying is, when he looked at his life, he was a Pharisee. He was a pretty good person and he felt like I'm in the running. I'm alive, spiritually alive. I'm a pretty good person. I've got a real chance to be saved. I've got a real chance to get to heaven. I've got a real chance for God's blessing. I'm really good. And the reason he felt alive and like a good person was because he tended to look at the law of God the way most of us do. And that is he read the Ted Kim Amman's in terms of external behavior only. So he would go down the list and he could tick it off. He said, OK, I don't bow down to any statues. OK, that's good. I call my mother and father once a week from New York City. And so I'm honoring my parents, OK? And I'm not committing adultery and I'm not stealing. And I don't kill anybody. At least I haven't killed anybody really important. You know, it's Paul out. I killed a few Christians, but they had it coming. And so he goes down. He was alive. He said, hey, you know, as long as he was looking at the law in terms of external behavior, he said, hey, I'm OK. But then the 10th Kim Amman. And the problem with the 10th Kim Amman is there's no way to read it in terms of behavior. It's about motives. It's about your heart. It's about your intentions. Thou shalt not covet. You know what the opposite of coveting is, contentment. And he realized it was saying that if you really love God, if you really were resting in God, if you really had God, then the commandment is Thou shalt love God enough to be content. But when he looked inside his heart, he saw all kinds of coveting. He saw all kinds of stuff. He saw anger because he was killing people who didn't agree with him. You know, he was persecuting the church. He saw fury and self-righteousness and envy and comparing himself to other people. He saw the inside. He was a mess. And he says, it slum me. And you know what that means? I realized I was spiritually dead as the lawless people that underneath all my morality and underneath all my goodness. I realized that the law was actually creating something inside. It was creating all of this insecurity, creating all of this problem, creating all this anger, creating all this envy. What is he talking about? Why would he say, I'm just as lost, I'm just as dead spiritually as the immoral people out there. Robert Lewis Stevenson in Jekyll Hyde has a fascinating passage. When I read it, I was blown away by it. And I realized it never comes out in any of the kind of horror, you know, films and plays and things based on the story. When Dr. Jekyll realized that Edward Hyde was killing people, he made a resolution. What first of all, he said, no more potion, okay? I'm not taking that again. I'm never going to take the potion because that's how he became Edward Hyde. So I'm not taking the potion. And secondly, I'm going to live such a good life. I'm going to be more good, more moral, more generous, more kind, more upright than I've ever been, than anyone's ever been. And I'm going to with an act of my will, I'm going to obey the moral law and I'm going to actually squeeze out and repress Edward Hyde so he never shows up again. And he does a very good job, but we're told this, here's the passage. He says, I resolved in my future conduct to redeem the past. And my resolve was fruitful. You know how earnestly in the last few months of this last year, I labored to relieve suffering. You know how I lived. You know how much was done for other people. But on one fine, clear January day, I was sitting in the sun in Regent's Park. And I reflected in smiled, comparing myself with other men, comparing my act of good will with the lazy cruelty of their neglect of their fellow man. And at the very moment of that vain, glorious thought, a qualm came over me. A horrid nausea and dreadful shuttering. And I looked down and I was once more Edward Hyde without the potion. And see, this is the turning point. This is the beginning of the end because when he became Edward Hyde without the potion, he knew he was cooked. But why would he have become Edward Hyde without the potion? And the answer is not in spite of his goodness, but because of his goodness. Did you hear what he said? You hear what the passage said? It was as he was thinking about how much better he was than everyone else. As he was thinking about how other people are cool, other people are living selfish lives. And I'm not. I'm living a very good life. I'm caring about everybody at that moment he became Edward Hyde without the potion. Why? He became Edward Hyde through his goodness, not in spite of his goodness. Why? Because there's two ways to be self-centered, you know. One is by being very bad and breaking all the rules, but the other is by being very good and becoming a self-righteous Pharisee. There's two ways to be your own Savior and Lord rather than God and trample on other people. One is by saying, I'm going to live my own life, nobody tells me how to live my life. I'm going to break all the moral laws of I once, so that's being your own God, right? But see, if you say I'm going to be so good that God's going to have to bless me and take me to heaven, you're being your own Savior, right? You're not letting God be your Savior. And even though there's all kinds of moral behavior in your life, inside you are filled with self-righteousness and cruelty and bigotry and you're miserable because you're always comparing yourself to other people and you never are sure you're good enough. See? And what does that mean? It means that you can't deal with your hideousness, you can't deal with that self-centeredness, you can't deal with that self-absorption by trying to be a good person and by just bringing the moral law to bear so that you can say, now I'm going to be a really, really good person that can just make you worse. You don't deal with your hideousness with an act of the will, you need a complete transformation of the very motives of your heart or you're dead.

### Part 3: What Will Work

#### 1. The Transformative Power of Christ

So that's our problem and that's what will not solve our problem, but what will? Not just application of the will to the moral law, not just application of the moral law to your heart through an act of the will, what will, what will really solve it. And the answer is up in verses 1 to 7. The very beginning of this passage is kind of weird when you first read through it. Did you notice that? You really couldn't figure out what was going on in the beginning and then his time went on, you sort of figured it out. That first part is very weird and here's why. Paul is dealing with a question. He actually poses it in verse 7. He says, okay then, considering all that we've been talking about, that the law doesn't really sanctify us, the law doesn't really make us any better, the law if anything is a greenhouse effect on what's wrong with us. And he says, what then shall we say, that the law is bad, that the law is sin? Shall we just throw the law and say, oh, when you're a Christian, you don't have to listen to the law. Is that what he's saying? No. He says, by no means. He says, if it wasn't for the law, I wouldn't know what's wrong with me. I wouldn't know how I should live. And so every indication in verse 7 is as a Christian, you should follow the law. You do need to obey it. You do need to let it sift through you and guide you as to how you should live your life. You do. Well, then what is he saying? We shouldn't do. And that is, he's saying in verses 1 to 4, especially, we should obey the law, we should follow the law, but we mustn't be married to the law. Married to the law. Now, you miss that unless you read, rather carefully, and the metaphor is a little bit odd. In verse 1, 2, and 3, he's talking about a woman who's married. And he's saying, well, you know, if you're married, and there's a death, if you're married and one of the spouses dies, you're free to re-marry. Marriage is binding, he says, and you just can't go off and do anything you want. But if there's a death, see, if one spouse dies, then the other spouse is free to re-marry. That's what he's saying in verses 1 and 2 and 3. Then he suddenly shows what the metaphor is all about. In verse 4, he says, so you must die to the law to belong to another. And then what he means by that is, up to this point, we're married to the law. We're in the arms of the law. What in the world would that mean? Why would he talk about being married spiritually speaking to the law of God? What does it mean to be married to the law of God? Well, marriage, think about it. When you first become married, not only does your entire life revolve around your spouse but so does your self-image and self-program. I mean, here's what I mean by that. Your self-appreciation, your self-regard, your self-understanding, is massively reprogrammed by your spouse. Your self-image is the product of what everybody says about you. Your parents have said things about you. Your siblings have said things about you. Your friends, your parents, your teachers, your coaches. People have been saying things about you all your life. And they say you're good. They say you're bad. And you know, you call out of that a feeling of who you are, what you're good at, what you're bad at. But when you get married, because of the power of the relationship of marriage, you can look into the face of your spouse. And your spouse can overturn what everybody's saying about you. In the face of your spouse, you can have your entire self-image reprogrammed. In other words, if everybody calls you ugly, but your spouse looks at you and says, you're beautiful. You feel beautiful. Your spouse has that kind of power to massively reprogram your self-understanding, your self-image, your self-worth.

What does it mean to be married to the law? It's not just you follow the law to please God. That's fine. You have to do that, or you follow the law in order to serve your neighbor. That's fine. You have to do that. To be married to the law means you're getting you very self from your performance. You're looking into the face of the law. And you're saying, because I'm good, because I'm obedient, because I'm moral, because I'm religious, because I read the Bible, because I pray because I do all these good things. Now I know I'm a good person. That proof, you're trying to prove yourself to God or to other people or to yourself by your moral performance. And if that's the case, you're married to the law. And verse 6 goes beyond that and says, you're a captive to the law. You're a slave to the law. You know why? Because the dominant motive in your life is fear. You may be incredibly good. You may be incredibly moral, but the dominant motive, the dominant motivational structure of the hardest fear. So for example, if you're married to the law and you're a very good person, you tell the truth. Do you not? You tell the truth. You don't lie. Why do you tell the truth? Because you're scared. You tell the truth because your scared God will get you, but he'll condemn you. He'll send you to hell. You're maybe went to Harvard Law School and you took an ethics course and you're scared because it'll ruin your profits. But see, everybody in this culture, everybody in this culture, whether it's inside the church or outside the church, gets you to be good through fear. You don't want to be like those awful people. You don't want people to find out. You don't want to be caught. You don't want God to punish you. Fear, fear, fear. And you know what? If you are, therefore, trying to, in a sense, earn your salvation, earn your self-image through your performance, you're driven. Inside, you're always comparing yourself to other people. You're crushed by criticism. You're furious and condescending toward people who don't have your beliefs. You can't handle failure. And if you try to deal with your fear and fear is basically self-absorption. You know what fear is? Fear is thinking of yourself. What about me? What about me? What about me? How am I doing? How am I looking? How are people treating me? Fear is incredibly self-absorbed. And you cannot deal, therefore, with self-absorption and fear by saying I'm going to be really good, and then God will have to bless me and people will really see that I'm a good person. It just makes it worse. A wretched people that we are, who will deliver us from this body of death. Thanks be. Verse 4 says, You can die to the law that you belong to another. Who? You need to become the spiritual spouses. You need to have someone else's love. You need to have someone else's face that you're looking into in order to find out who you are. You die, according to verse 4, to the law and you belong to another through the body of Jesus Christ, through the death of Jesus Christ on the cross.

See, at the end of Jekyll Hyde, Jekyll kills himself, you know why? Because justice is at the door. Edward Hyde had murdered people. But he was never having to pay for his sins because the police couldn't find him because he kept becoming Dr. Jekyll. But when Jekyll realized that he was becoming Hyde permanently, he realized that he was going to be caught by the police. He was going to have to pay for his sins. Judgment day was at hand, so he killed himself anyway. And it's quite a metaphor, is it not? For judgment? No matter how hard you hide, no matter how often you put it off, eventually your sins will find you out. There will be a judgment day. Your hideousness will be revealed. And there's nothing you can do to stop it. Judgment day will come. Well, wait a minute. There is something. Isaiah 52 and 53 talk about Jesus Christ, the suffering servant who comes to save us and this is what it says about him. **"They were appalled at him. His appearance was disfigured beyond that of a man and his form marred beyond human likeness. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him. Nothing in his appearance that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by men, like one from whom men hide their faces. He was despised and we esteemed him not. But he was pierced for our transgressions. He was crushed for our iniquities. The punishment that brought us peace was upon him and by his wounds we are healed."**

Did you hear this? We were appalled at him. He was so hideous, we couldn't look upon him. We turned our faces from him. What does it mean when 2 Corinthians 5.21 said, God made him sin, who knew no sin that we might become the righteousness of God and him? God made him sin, treated him as pure evil. Jesus Christ became the hideous one. And he took our judgment day. And he died for us while we were hideous. Ephesians 5. Husbands love your wives as Christ loved us and gave himself for us, that he could present us to himself pure, beautiful, without spot or blemish. The only thing that is going to silence that self-centeredness, that fear at the center of your life, that black hole that's making your life miserable and everybody else's, that says, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, me, me, me, me. I've got to have this, I've got to do that. You know, there's a moral version of that. I'm afraid that God's going to get me, so I better be good. And there's an immoral version of that. I'm afraid that God's going to oppress me, so I got to live the way I want to live. But only Jesus Christ, as your new heavenly spouse, who has given himself for you unconditionally, when you were hideous to make you beautiful, only Jesus Christ looking at you in the face and saying, I love you, I love you unconditionally. I love you, only that. If you look into his face and see that, only that will destroy, eventually, the fear in the heart of your being that is just driving you into the ground. That fear, I've got to do this, I've got to do that. Jesus Christ says, I've got a new motive for you. Gratitude, security, and love. Tell the truth to resemble me and to please me and to delight me and to become like me. Out of gratitude, not because it could be condemned, because now there is no condemnation for those who enjoy Christ Jesus because of what he did. Tell the truth, give your money to the poor, out of love, out of joy, out of gratitude. That's the only motivation that won't drive you into the ground. Let the spousal love of Jesus Christ completely reconfigure the motivational structures of your heart. Lay your deadly doing down at Jesus' feet, stand in Him and Him alone. Gloriously complete. Let us pray.

Thank you, Father, for giving us this very dark message. It's a dark chapter, but it ends on a note of joy. Oh, wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from this body of death? Thanks be to Jesus Christ through Him. We die to our old spouse, the law, and die to the fear because of your reassurance. And we look into the face of our new heavenly spouse, and we hear Him say, I love you. And I died for you. And now there's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. And we ask that you would help us apply this to our own lives through your Holy Spirit. We ask it in Jesus' name, amen.

### 引言：改变的挣扎

你是否渴望在生活中看到真正的改变，在你的习惯、关系、心灵中？今天，Tim Keller 探讨了基督徒生活中持久改变的实际发生方式，以及为什么福音提供了一种与其他任何东西截然不同的转变过程。

今天的经文阅读在你们的公告第9页，来自罗马书7章1到9节，然后是18到25节。

> "弟兄们，我现在对那些知道律法的人说，你们岂不晓得律法管人是在活着的时候吗？就如女人有了丈夫，丈夫还活着，就被律法约束；丈夫若死了，就脱离了丈夫的律法。所以丈夫活着的时候，若与别的男人同居，便叫淫妇；丈夫若死了，就脱离了律法，虽然与别的男人同居，也不是淫妇。我的弟兄们，这样说来，你们借着基督的身体向律法也是死了，叫你们归于别人，就是归于那从死里复活的，叫我们结果子给神。因为我们属肉体的时候，那因律法而生的恶欲就在我们肢体中发动，以致结成死亡的果子。但我们既然在捆我们的律法上死了，现今就脱离了律法，叫我们服事主，要按着心灵的新样，不按着仪文的旧样。这样，我们可说什么呢？律法是罪吗？断乎不是！只是非因律法，我就不知何为罪。非律法说不可贪心，我就不知何为贪心。罪趁着机会，借着诫命叫诸般的贪心在我里头发动，因为没有律法罪是死的。我以前没有律法是活着的，但是诫命来到，罪又活了，我就死了。我也知道在我里头，就是我肉体之中，没有良善。因为立志为善由得我，只是行出来由不得我。故此，我所愿意的善，我反不做；我所不愿意的恶，我倒去做。若我去做所不愿意做的，就不是我做的，乃是住在我里头的罪做的。我觉得有个律，就是我愿意为善的时候，便有恶与我同在。因为按着我里面的人，我是喜欢神的律；但我觉得肢体中另有个律和我心中的律交战，把我掳去叫我服从那肢体中犯罪的律。我真是苦啊，谁能救我脱离这取死的身体呢？感谢神，靠着我们的主耶稣基督就能脱离了。"

上周他说，当我第一次成为基督徒时，我生活中有些事情需要深刻改变，但它们没有改变。然后我读了两位作者，约翰·欧文和约翰·斯托特，在他们的书中，他们仿佛引导我去罗马书6、7和8章。当我开始掌握那里所教导的东西时，那就是我自己生活中真正改变开始的时候。因此，我想带你们进入这个关于罗马书6、7和8章的简短系列，并提出问题，改变在某人的生活中是如何真正发生的？基督，信仰基督，如何非常具体和实际地导致改变？

上周我们整体看了罗马书6章，我们看到了某些原则。这次我们整体看罗马书7章，其中以非常鲜明、令人震惊的现实术语描绘了人类的心灵，我们真正拥有的是什么。然后当我们到达罗马书8章时，罗马书6章是原则，罗马书7章是这些原则必须应用的心灵，而罗马书8章将花两到三周时间看如何将这些原则应用于心灵以带来改变的更实际方面。

今晚我要从开始到结束，从结尾到开始，我们将看这段经文的最后部分，中间部分，然后是第一部分。当我们这样看罗马书7章时，我认为我们会学到三件事。我们最大的问题是什么，什么对它不起作用，以及什么会起作用。我们最大的问题是什么，什么不会解决或解决这个问题，以及什么会。

### 第一部分：我们最大的问题

#### 1. 人类心灵的深度分裂

保罗在第18和19节中非常经典地指出，**"我有行善的意愿，但没有能力去执行。"** 就是这样。我可以渴望和设想正确的事情，但我在自己里面找不到实际执行和做到的力量。为什么？答案是我们在这里所称的，人类心灵的深度分裂，分裂因为在第20节他说，**"若我去做所不愿意做的，就不是我做的，乃是住在我里头的罪做的。"** 他说，有我，然后在我里面有某种东西，他说，那就是罪。

事实上，注意一下在第19节中，他谈到了邪恶。有邪恶和罪居住在他里面，居住在我们里面。然后注意那个词居住，非常非常重要。邪恶和罪不是仅仅从外部作用于我们的东西，也不是暂时进入我们并扎营的东西，如果你知道你在做什么，你可以把它赶走。**它在我们里面是家的感觉。它居住在我们里面。它居住在我们里面。它深深地根植于我们里面，结果是，我们有这种关于善与恶的深度分裂。**

现在，文学中对此的经典描绘是罗伯特·路易斯·史蒂文森的书《化身博士》。你真的读过这本书吗？我打赌你没有，因为我们通常是看电影和戏剧，而我喜欢从书中工作。它不是很长。大约80页。是一本相当短的书，但却是一本引人入胜的书，你基本上知道叙述。杰基尔博士意识到他是一个所谓的善恶不一致的复合体，良心与贪欲的复合体。他感到因为这个原因，他的坏本性阻碍了他的好本性，所以他可以渴望做事情，但他永远无法实现它们，就像罗马书7章一样。

但他想出了一个主意，一种药水。他要调制一种药水，将两种本性从彼此中分离出来。他打算在晚上喝药水，让他的坏一面出来。但在白天，当他工作时，他将是他的好自我，他的好自我现在将不受束缚。那将是自由于邪恶的影响，并能够实现其所有目标。好理论。但当他喝下药水，他的坏本性一面出来时，他震惊地发现，他比他曾经敢于相信的要邪恶得多。这就是问题所在。

他在书中的叙述中说，**"我在这新生命的第一口气中就知道自己比我想象的要邪恶十倍，而这种想法让我像酒一样振奋和愉悦。这个爱德华·海德本质上是恶意的。他的每一个行为和思想都以自我为中心。"** 他的每一个行为和思想都以自我为中心。为什么他的坏一面叫爱德华·海德，你知道为什么吗？因为他是可怕的。是可怕的，但也是因为他是隐藏的。他甚至对杰基尔博士隐藏，根本不知道他是如此邪恶。

所以当爱德华·海德听到叙述继续时，爱德华·海德出来了，他比杰基尔博士想象的要邪恶得多。他开始做可怕的事情，包括谋杀。最后，我们会回到这一点。杰基尔博士说，我要试着阻止它，然后我要试着压制这个邪恶的一面，但爱德华·海德越来越占上风，越来越控制。当杰基尔博士意识到他即将失去完全控制，甚至不再成为杰基尔博士，而是永久成为爱德华·海德时，他自杀了。非常非常令人不安的叙述。

但直接来自罗马书7章，因为罗马书7章所说的和罗伯特·路易斯·史蒂文森所说的是一样的。那就是第一，即使是最好的人，即使是最聪明和体面的杰基尔博士或使徒保罗，即使是最好的人，在他们存在的核心都有一种可怕的东西，一种邪恶，一种令人难以置信的自我中心的能力，因为注意罗伯特·路易斯·史蒂文森实际上以一种非常圣经的方式定义了海德的可怕之处，绝对的每一个思想都以自我为中心。正是这种自我吸收和自我中心，它是我，我的需求和我的利益和我的欲望，这种令人难以置信的能力以自我为中心导致了邪恶。

所以即使在最好的人中，也有一种邪恶的核心，一种做可怕事情的能力远远超出你相信的程度。远远超过，远远比你想象的要糟糕。它对你隐藏。但有时有某些情况会像药水一样起作用，压力，诱惑，与一个困难的人结婚。真正的邪恶，真正的邪恶能力，那种令人难以置信的可怕，那种巨大的，几乎无尽的自我中心，自我吸收，自我意志，自我放纵的能力出来了，然后你就死了。

你相信这一点吗，即使是最好的人也有能力做出如此可怕的事情，而你几乎可以肯定，无论我们在这里被教导的是什么，你对自己邪恶和罪恶能力的评估都太小。太小了。

Sufjan Stevens 是一位独立摇滚艺术家，你们中的一些人知道，有一首歌叫《John Wayne Gacy》。这是一首关于连环杀手的歌。John Wayne Gacy 杀了30个人，把他们藏在他家的地板下。Sufjan 唱这位连环杀手，歌曲的最后两行绝对令人震惊。事实上，即使是村声的音乐评论家也被震惊了，因为在最后，他唱着这位连环杀手，多么可怕，多么可怕的人，令人难以置信的连环杀手，最后的几行是这样的。**"但在我最好的行为中，我实际上和他一样。看看我隐藏的秘密。"** 他说，看看我生活的地板下，你会看到做可怕事情的能力。

你相信吗？你真的相信史蒂文森所说的，Sufjan Stevens 所说的，罗伯特·路易斯·史蒂文森所说的，保罗所说的，在你里面你有一种可怕的，自私的，邪恶的能力，远远超出你真正认为你能做到的。但在某些时候，你可能会发现某种情况，把它带出来，然后你就死了。

### 第二部分：无效的方法

#### 1. 道德律法的无效性

所以如果是这样，理解这一点很重要，那就是这样，我们该怎么办？第二点，大多数人试图用来解决它的主要解决方案，保罗说不起作用。那是什么？这与道德律法有关。

现在，当我们在这里看到保罗谈论转向律法和转向道德律法时，他想到的是摩西律法，他是犹太人，他想到的是摩西律法中的十诫。但他在这里所说的实际上在所有文化中都适用。在C.S. Lewis的书《人的废除》的结尾，他有一个附录，非常有价值，在那个附录中，他比较了儒教、印度教、佛教、伊斯兰教、基督教和犹太教的道德律法。他展示了一种显著的趋同，一种显著的共识，关于上帝对我们的基本要求是什么，关于道德生活的基本要求是什么。

因此，我们确实理解道德律法，我们确实知道它是什么。在所有文化和所有宗教中，大多数人对我们有坏本性的事实所做的事情是，我们采取道德律法，并以巨大的意志力应用于我们的坏本性。换句话说，我们试图用我们的杰基尔来消灭我们的海德。我们试图通过变得极其杰基尔，极其善良，极其顺从来处理我们的爱德华·海德。我们形成道德社区，在其中我们每周阅读道德律法，我们赞美它，我们遵守它，我们教育我们的孩子，我们说通过将上帝的道德律法应用于人们的生活，这就是我们将克服我们的可怕，那种自私，那种骄傲，那种自我中心摧毁人的方式，这就是我们将克服它的方式。

保罗说，这不起作用。事实上，保罗在第5节中说了一些绝对惊人的事情。看看第5节。他说，**"因为我们属肉体的时候，那因律法而生的恶欲就在我们肢体中发动，以致结成死亡的果子。"** 因律法而生的恶欲，因律法而生的恶欲。保罗说，律法对我们的问题有温室效应。它不会使它枯萎，它会加剧它，它会繁荣它，它会增长它。你说什么？现在怎么可能？他说，通过意志力应用上帝的律法，只是坚持并将上帝的律法带到某人的生活中并说，这是你必须做的。这是你必须做的。这是你必须做的。它不会让你成为一个更好的人。它让你变得更糟。它带出来。它加剧了你的问题。怎么可能？

好吧，在某种程度上，没有人比圣奥古斯丁谈论这个更好，顺便说一下，圣奥古斯丁在他著名的书《忏悔录》中反思了他年轻时的一个事件。在他年轻时的某个时候，他闯入一个私人果园，从一棵不是他的树上偷了一些梨子。当然。后来，他在神学上深刻地反思了那个事件。他回想起来，他说，为什么我偷了梨子？A，我不饿。B，如果我饿了，我不喜欢梨子。在他偷了梨子后，他把它们扔给了猪。他甚至不喜欢梨子，但他去偷了梨子。他说，为什么我偷了梨子？我甚至不喜欢梨子。答案是，我偷了梨子，因为有人告诉我它们是被禁止的。换句话说，有人说你不可以拿那些梨子。他说，直到有人说你不可以，我对梨子没有兴趣。但一旦他们说，不要拿那些梨子，我就想要它们。

心里有某种东西。在心灵深处，有一种我们可怕的，自我中心的，自我吸收的方面，说没有人告诉我如何生活。现在有很多人，这在你的生活表面上，因为有很多人总是这样说。没有人告诉我如何生活我的生活，你看。但我们其他人，很多人，哦，我们不这样说，我们非常好，但在我们内心深处，在你内心深处，杰基尔先生和女士们，是我们心灵的一部分，绝对讨厌被告知如何生活。这是我们的问题的一部分。当你将道德律法带到一个孩子身上或将道德律法带到人们身上，将道德律法带到人们身上时，它不是使我们存在的那个方面枯萎，而是加剧了它，人们因为被禁止而做事情。

但不仅仅是这样。律法如何对我们的问题起温室效应？保罗实际上在第8和9节中说，或者保罗实际上给了我们一个小的自传式素描，讲述他如何从一个法律主义的法利赛人转变为基督徒。这不是一个容易掌握的素描，非常非常简略。好吧，他说，我在没有律法的时候是活着的，但然后十诫之一，我不可以贪心来到我面前，杀了我。诗篇可以深刻地塑造你接近上帝的方式，甚至耶稣依靠诗篇来面对每一种情况，包括死亡。在Tim和Kathy Keller的365天灵修书《耶稣的诗篇》中，你会发现每天通过诗篇的阅读，带有新鲜的圣经见解。如果你没有定期的灵修习惯，这本书是一个很好的开始方式。如果你已经花时间学习和祷告，那么阅读和祷告诗篇可以帮助你将最深的情感和问题带到上帝面前，并发现与他的新层次的亲密关系。我们将把Tim和Kathy Keller的灵修书作为感谢你的礼物，帮助福音与生活与更多人分享耶稣的爱。今天在gospelandlife.com/give获取你的副本。那是gospelandlife.com/give。

这是什么意思？现在，我认为这意味着什么。保罗说，我是活着的。那是什么意思？我是属灵活着的。那是什么意思？好吧，你知道，我们谈论一个团队如果还在争夺冠军，那就是还活着。你知道吗？保罗说的是，当他看他的生活时，他是一个法利赛人。他是一个相当好的人，他觉得我在争夺中。我活着，属灵活着。我是一个相当好的人。我有真正的机会得救。我有真正的机会进入天堂。我有真正的机会得到上帝的祝福。我真的很好。他感到活着，像一个好人，因为他倾向于像我们大多数人一样看待上帝的律法。那就是他以外部行为的方式阅读十诫。所以他会逐一检查。他说，好吧，我不向任何雕像下拜。好吧，这很好。我每周从纽约市打电话给我的父母。所以我在尊敬我的父母，好吧？我没有犯奸淫，我没有偷窃。我没有杀人。至少我没有杀过真正重要的人。你知道，保罗说。我杀了一些基督徒，但他们活该。所以他逐一检查。他活着。他说，嘿，你知道，只要他以外部行为的方式看待律法，他说，嘿，我没事。但然后是第十诫。第十诫的问题是，没有办法以行为的方式阅读它。它关于动机。它关于你的心。它关于你的意图。你不可贪心。你知道贪心的反面是什么，满足。他意识到它在说，如果你真的爱上帝，如果你真的在上帝里安息，如果你真的拥有上帝，那么诫命就是你要爱上帝到足以满足。但当他看他的内心时，他看到各种贪心。他看到各种东西。他看到愤怒，因为他在杀那些不同意他的人。你知道，他在迫害教会。他看到愤怒和自义和嫉妒和与他人比较。他看到内心。他是一团糟。他说，它杀了我。你知道这意味着什么吗？我意识到我在属灵上和那些无律法的人一样死。我意识到在我所有的道德和所有的善良之下。我意识到律法实际上在内部创造了一些东西。它创造了所有这些不安全感，创造了所有这些问题，创造了所有这些愤怒，创造了所有这些嫉妒。他在说什么？为什么他说，我和外面那些不道德的人一样迷失，我在属灵上和他们一样死。罗伯特·路易斯·史蒂文森在《化身博士》中有一个引人入胜的段落。当我读到它时，我被震惊了。我意识到它从未出现在任何基于这个故事的恐怖电影和戏剧中。当杰基尔博士意识到爱德华·海德在杀人时，他做了一个决心。首先，他说，不再喝药水，好吗？我不再喝那个。我永远不会再喝药水，因为那是他变成爱德华·海德的方式。所以我不喝药水。其次，我要过一种非常好的生活。我将比以往任何时候都更好，更道德，更慷慨，更善良，更正直，我将以我的意志力，我将遵守道德律法，我将实际挤压和压制爱德华·海德，使他永远不再出现。他做得很好，但我们被告知这一点，这就是段落。他说，我决心在我未来的行为中赎回过去。我的决心是有成果的。你知道在去年最后几个月里，我多么努力地减轻痛苦。你知道我如何生活。你知道为他人做了多少。但在一个晴朗的1月的一天，我坐在摄政公园的阳光下。我反思并微笑，比较自己与其他人，比较我的善意行为与他们对同胞的懒惰残忍。在那虚荣的想法的那一刻，一种不安袭来。一种可怕的恶心和可怕的颤抖。我低头一看，我又一次变成了没有药水的爱德华·海德。你看，这是转折点。这是结束的开始，因为当他在没有药水的情况下变成爱德华·海德时，他知道他完蛋了。但为什么他会在没有药水的情况下变成爱德华·海德？答案不是因为他的善良，而是因为他的善良。你听到他说什么了吗？你听到段落说什么了吗？正当他在思考自己比其他人好多少时。正当他在思考其他人很酷，其他人过着自私的生活。而我没有。我过着非常好的生活。我关心每个人，在那一刻他在没有药水的情况下变成了爱德华·海德。为什么？他通过他的善良变成了爱德华·海德，而不是因为他的善良。为什么？因为有两种方式可以自我中心，你知道。一种是通过非常坏和打破所有规则，但另一种是通过非常好和成为一个自义的法利赛人。有两种方式可以成为你自己的救主和主而不是上帝并践踏他人。一种是说，我要过我自己的生活，没有人告诉我如何过我的生活。我将打破所有我曾经的道德律法，所以那是成为你自己的上帝，对吧？但看，如果你说我要好到上帝必须祝福我并带我上天堂，你就是在成为你自己的救主，对吧？你没有让上帝成为你的救主。即使在你的生活中有各种道德行为，你内心充满了自义和残忍和偏执，你很痛苦，因为你总是在与他人比较，你永远不确定你是否足够好。看？这意味着什么？这意味着你不能通过试图成为一个好人和仅仅通过将道德律法带到你的心灵来处理你的可怕，以便你可以说，现在我要成为一个非常非常好的人，这只会让你变得更糟。你不能通过意志的行为来处理你的可怕，你需要对你心灵动机的完全转变，否则你就死了。

### 第三部分：有效的方法

#### 1. 基督的转变力量

所以这是我们的问题，这就是不能解决我们问题的方法，但什么会呢？不仅仅是将意志应用于道德律法，不仅仅是通过意志的行为将道德律法应用于你的心灵，什么会，什么会真正解决它。答案在第1到7节。这个段落的开头有点奇怪，当你第一次读到它时。你注意到了吗？你真的无法弄清楚一开始发生了什么，然后随着时间的推移，你有点弄清楚了。第一部分非常奇怪，这就是为什么。保罗在处理一个问题。他实际上在第7节中提出了这个问题。他说，好吧，那么，考虑到我们一直在谈论的所有事情，律法并没有真正使我们成圣，律法并没有真正使我们变得更好，律法如果有什么的话，对我们的问题有温室效应。他说，那么我们该说什么呢，律法是坏的吗，律法是罪吗？我们是否应该抛弃律法并说，哦，当你是基督徒时，你不必听律法。他是在说这个吗？不。他说，绝对不是。他说，如果不是因为律法，我就不知道我有什么问题。我不知道我应该如何生活。因此，在第7节中的每一个迹象都表明，作为基督徒，你应该遵循律法。你确实需要遵守它。你确实需要让它筛选你并指导你如何生活你的生活。你确实需要。那么他在说什么呢？我们不应该做的是什么。那就是，他在第1到4节中，特别是，我们应该遵守律法，我们应该遵循律法，但我们不应该与律法结婚。与律法结婚。现在，除非你仔细阅读，否则你会错过这一点，隐喻有点奇怪。在第1、2和3节中，他在谈论一个已婚的女人。他说，好吧，你知道，如果你结婚了，并且有一个死亡，如果你结婚了并且其中一个配偶死了，你就可以再婚。婚姻是有约束力的，他说，你不能随便去做任何你想做的事情。但如果有一个死亡，你看，如果一个配偶死了，那么另一个配偶就可以再婚。这就是他在第1、2和3节中所说的。然后他突然展示了隐喻的全部意义。在第4节中，他说，所以你必须向律法死去以归于另一个。然后他的意思是，到目前为止，我们与律法结婚。我们在律法的怀抱中。这是什么意思？为什么他会谈论在属灵上与上帝的律法结婚？与上帝的律法结婚是什么意思？好吧，想想婚姻。当你第一次结婚时，不仅你的整个生活围绕着你的配偶旋转，而且你的自我形象和自我程序也是如此。我的意思是，这就是我的意思。你的自我欣赏，你的自我尊重，你的自我理解，被你的配偶大规模重新编程。你的自我形象是每个人对你说的话的产物。你的父母对你说过一些话。你的兄弟姐妹对你说过一些话。你的朋友，你的父母，你的老师，你的教练。人们一生都在对你说一些话。他们说你很好。他们说你不好。你知道，你从中得出一种对自己的感觉，你擅长什么，你不擅长什么。但当你结婚时，由于婚姻关系的力量，你可以看着你配偶的脸。你的配偶可以推翻每个人对你说的话。在你配偶的脸上，你可以重新编程你的整个自我形象。换句话说，如果每个人都叫你丑，但你的配偶看着你说，你很美。你感到美丽。你的配偶有这种能力大规模重新编程你的自我理解，你的自我形象，你的自我价值。

与律法结婚是什么意思？这不仅仅是你遵循律法以取悦上帝。这很好。你必须这样做，或者你遵循律法以服务你的邻居。这很好。你必须这样做。与律法结婚意味着你从你的表现中获得了你自己。你看着律法的脸。你说，因为我很好，因为我顺从，因为我道德，因为我宗教，因为我读圣经，因为我祷告因为我做所有这些好事。现在我知道我是一个好人。那个证明，你试图通过你的道德表现向上帝或其他人或自己证明自己。如果是这样的话，你就与律法结婚了。第6节更进一步说，你是律法的俘虏。你是律法的奴隶。你知道为什么吗？因为你生活中的主导动机是恐惧。你可能非常好。你可能非常道德，但主导动机，心灵的主导动机结构是恐惧。例如，如果你与律法结婚并且你是一个非常好的人，你说实话。你不说谎。你为什么说实话？因为你害怕。你说实话，因为你害怕上帝会惩罚你，但他会谴责你。他会把你送到地狱。你可能去了哈佛法学院，你上了一门伦理课程，你害怕因为它会毁了你的利润。但看，这个文化中的每个人，无论是在教会内部还是外部，都通过恐惧让你变得好。你不想成为那些可怕的人。你不想让人们发现。你不想被抓住。你不想让上帝惩罚你。恐惧，恐惧，恐惧。你知道吗？如果你因此试图在某种意义上通过你的表现来赚取你的救赎，赚取你的自我形象，你被驱动。内心，你总是在与他人比较。你被批评压垮。你对没有你信仰的人感到愤怒和居高临下。你无法处理失败。如果你试图处理你的恐惧，恐惧基本上是自我吸收。你知道恐惧是什么吗？恐惧是想着自己。我呢？我呢？我呢？我怎么样？我看起来怎么样？人们如何对待我？恐惧是极其自我吸收的。因此，你不能通过说我要变得非常好，然后上帝将不得不祝福我，人们将真正看到我是一个好人来处理自我吸收和恐惧。它只会让事情变得更糟。我们是可怜的人，谁能救我们脱离这取死的身体。感谢。第4节说，你可以向律法死去以归于另一个。谁？你需要成为属灵的配偶。你需要有别人的爱。你需要有别人的脸，你在看着，以便找出你是谁。根据第4节，你向律法死去，通过耶稣基督的身体，通过耶稣基督在十字架上的死亡归于另一个。

看，在《化身博士》的结尾，杰基尔自杀了，你知道为什么吗？因为正义就在门口。爱德华·海德杀了人。但他从未为他的罪付出代价，因为警察找不到他，因为他一直变成杰基尔博士。但当杰基尔意识到他正在永久变成海德时，他意识到他将被警察抓住。他将不得不为他的罪付出代价。审判日就在眼前，所以他无论如何都自杀了。这是一个相当的隐喻，不是吗？对于审判？无论你如何努力隐藏，无论你多么经常推迟，最终你的罪将被发现。将会有一个审判日。你的可怕将被揭示。你无能为力来阻止它。审判日将到来。好吧，等一下。有一些事情。以赛亚书52和53章谈到耶稣基督，来拯救我们的受苦仆人，这就是它对他的描述。**"他们对他感到震惊。他的外貌被毁坏，超越了人的样子，他的形象被毁坏，超越了人类的样子。他没有美丽或威严吸引我们，没有什么在他的外貌中让我们渴望他。他被人藐视和拒绝，像一个人从人面前隐藏的人。他被藐视，我们不尊重他。但他为我们的过犯被刺伤。他为我们的罪孽被压伤。使我们得平安的惩罚在他身上，因他受的鞭伤我们得医治。"**

你听到了吗？我们对他感到震惊。他是如此可怕，我们无法看着他。我们转过脸去不看他。这是什么意思，当哥林多后书5:21说，神使那无罪的替我们成为罪，好叫我们在他里面成为神的义？神使他成为罪，视他为纯粹的邪恶。耶稣基督成为了可怕的那一个。他为我们承担了审判日。他在我们可怕的时候为我们而死。以弗所书5章。丈夫要爱妻子，正如基督爱我们，为我们舍己，使他可以将我们呈现给自己，纯洁，美丽，没有斑点或瑕疵。唯一能让你生活中心的那种自我中心沉默的东西，那种让你的生活和其他人生活痛苦的恐惧，那种说，哦，我的天哪，哦，我的天哪，哦，我的天哪，我，我，我，我。我必须拥有这个，我必须做那个。你知道，有一种道德版本的那种。我害怕上帝会惩罚我，所以我最好做好。而有一种不道德版本的那种。我害怕上帝会压迫我，所以我必须按照我想要的方式生活。但只有耶稣基督，作为你的新天上的配偶，已经无条件地为你付出，当你是可怕的时候使你美丽，只有耶稣基督看着你的脸说，我爱你，我无条件地爱你。我爱你，只有那样。如果你看着他的脸并看到那样，只有那样最终会摧毁你内心的恐惧，那种正在把你推向地面的恐惧。那种恐惧，我必须做这个，我必须做那个。耶稣基督说，我有一个新的动机给你。感恩，安全和爱。说实话，以便像我一样，以取悦我，以取悦我，以成为像我一样。出于感恩，而不是因为可能被谴责，因为现在对那些享受基督耶稣的人没有谴责，因为他所做的。说实话，把你的钱给穷人，出于爱，出于喜悦，出于感恩。这是唯一不会把你推向地面的动机。让耶稣基督的配偶之爱完全重新配置你心灵的动机结构。放下你致命的行为在耶稣的脚下，站在他和他独自一人。光荣地完整。让我们祷告。

感谢你，父亲，给了我们这个非常黑暗的信息。这是一个黑暗的章节，但它以喜悦的音符结束。哦，我是多么可怜的人，谁能救我脱离这取死的身体。感谢耶稣基督通过他。我们向我们的旧配偶，律法死去，并因你的保证而死于恐惧。我们看着我们新的天上的配偶的脸，我们听到他说，我爱你。我为你而死。现在对那些在基督耶稣里的人没有谴责。我们请求你通过你的圣灵帮助我们将其应用于我们自己的生活。我们奉耶稣的名祈求，阿门。
