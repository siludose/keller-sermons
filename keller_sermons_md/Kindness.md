### Introduction: The Difference Between Will-Power and Supernatural Change

The Bible says there's a world of difference between a will-power-driven heart and a supernaturally changed one. Today, Tim Keller is unpacking one of the fruit of the Spirit, helping us see what it means to move from trying to be good to truly changing from the inside out. Tonight's Scripture comes from John 15 verses 6 through 15.

> "If anyone does not remain in me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers. Such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned. If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish and it will be given you. This is to my Father's glory that you bear much fruit showing yourselves to be my disciples. As the Father has loved me so have I loved you. Now, remain in my love. If you obey my commands, you will remain in my love just as I have obeyed my Father's commands and remain in His love. I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete. My command is this, love each other as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this that he lay down his life for his friends. You are my friends if you do what I command. I no longer call you servants because a servant does not know his Master's business. Instead, I have called you friends. For everything that I learned from my Father, I have made known to you."

**This is the word of the Lord.**

### The Nature of Friendship

The marks of a supernaturally changed heart. A heart changed by the grace of God and the power of the Holy Spirit are listed in the classic text Galatians 5, verse 22 and 23, which lists what's called there, the fruit of the Spirit, and those traits are love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, and so on. And each week, we're taking one of those traits and looking at it in order that perhaps we could experience more of that supernatural change in our own lives.

Now, tonight we get to the trait, the spiritual fruit of kindness. And whenever preachers are working through the fruit of the Spirit, this is a big challenge, this particular one because the word kindness, the Greek word translated kindness, in the New Testament has a real breadth of meaning, unfortunately. Sometimes it can be, depending on the context, translated fitting, sometimes pleasing, sometimes honest, and sometimes compassionate.

### How to Forge Friendship

And therefore, how do you talk about kindness if it's a word that has that kind of what they call a lexical range? And the answer is you can't do it abstractly. You have to look at a relationship, a kind of relationship that combines all those traits, and the kind of relationship that combines them all is friendship.

And so what we're going to do with tonight is look at friendship. Not that you can't have friends without a supernatural change heart, but I think we're going to see there's a kind of friendship and there are resources for friendship given to you in the gospel that are second to none.

### The Power for Friendship

First, the character or nature of friendship. What's intriguing about this passage, and I gave you in a sense a sample of it, is that the beginning of chapter 15, Jesus speaks about his relationship to the disciples under the metaphor of vine and branches. He says, I'm the vine, you're the branches. And that's a metaphor that talks about relationship, right? But it's a metaphor of deep unity, because the vine and the branches share a common life. They share a common bond.

### Application: Friendship Across Differences

And what is this? It means, basically, that friends are people that you meet that have a common interest, a common passion, a common beliefs, and you immediately fill a oneness. And that means that to begin with, friends are discovered.

> "The counsel of a friend is pleasant."

But the actual Hebrew word means sweet. And one of the problems with understanding of actually anything in the Bible is you have to understand the original context. And in those days, you couldn't sweeten things. Cooks couldn't do that. They didn't have sugar in the places where the Bible was being written and at that time. You could discover sweetness. There are some foods that were naturally sweet, but cooks couldn't create sweetness.

**So when it talks about friendships being sweet, it's talking about not something you can create, but something you've discovered.**

### 引言：意志力与超自然改变的区别

圣经说，意志力驱动的心与超自然改变的心之间有天壤之别。今天，Tim Keller 正在解读圣灵的果子之一，帮助我们看到从努力做好人到真正从内心改变的意义。今晚的经文来自约翰福音 15 章 6 到 15 节。

> “人若不常在我里面，就像枝子丢在外面枯干，人拾起来扔在火里烧了。你们若常在我里面，我的话也常在你们里面，凡你们所愿意的，祈求就给你们成就。你们多结果子，我父因此得荣耀，你们也就是我的门徒了。父怎样爱我，我也怎样爱你们，你们要常在我的爱里。你们若遵守我的命令，就常在我的爱里，正如我遵守了我父的命令，常在他的爱里。这些事我已经对你们说了，是要叫我的喜乐存在你们心里，并叫你们的喜乐可以满足。这是我的命令：你们要彼此相爱，像我爱你们一样。人为朋友舍命，人的爱心没有比这个大的。你们若遵行我所吩咐的，就是我的朋友了。以后我不再称你们为仆人，因为仆人不知道主人所做的事。我乃称你们为朋友，因为我从我父所听见的，已经都告诉你们了。”

**这是主的话。**

### 友谊的本质

超自然改变的心的标志。一个被上帝的恩典和圣灵的力量改变的心，在经典文本加拉太书 5 章 22 和 23 节中列出，那里被称为圣灵的果子，这些特质是爱、喜乐、和平、忍耐、仁慈、良善等等。每周，我们都会选择其中一个特质进行探讨，以便我们在自己的生活中可能体验到更多的超自然改变。

现在，今晚我们要谈到的特质是仁慈的属灵果子。每当传道人在讲解圣灵的果子时，这都是一个巨大的挑战，尤其是这个，因为在新约中翻译为仁慈的希腊词具有非常广泛的意义。不幸的是，有时根据上下文，它可以被翻译为合适，有时是令人愉快，有时是诚实，有时是富有同情心。

### 如何建立友谊

因此，如果仁慈是一个具有这种所谓词汇范围的词，你如何谈论它？答案是你不能抽象地谈论它。你必须看一种关系，一种结合所有这些特质的关系，而结合它们的关系就是友谊。

因此，今晚我们要做的是看友谊。并不是说没有超自然改变的心就不能有朋友，但我认为我们会看到，在福音中给予你的友谊资源是无与伦比的。

### 友谊的力量

首先，友谊的特性或本质。这个段落中有趣的是，我在某种意义上给了你一个样本，是在第 15 章的开头，耶稣用葡萄树和枝子的比喻来谈论他与门徒的关系。他说，我是葡萄树，你们是枝子。这是一个谈论关系的比喻，对吗？但这是一个深度统一的比喻，因为葡萄树和枝子共享一个共同的生命。他们共享一个共同的纽带。

### 应用：跨越差异的友谊

这是什么意思？基本上，这意味着朋友是你遇到的有共同兴趣、共同激情、共同信仰的人，你立即感到一种合一。这意味着，首先，朋友是被发现的。

> “朋友的劝告是愉快的。”

但实际的希伯来词意为甜美。理解圣经中任何事物的一个问题是你必须理解原始背景。在那些日子里，你不能使东西变甜。厨师做不到。他们没有糖在圣经写作的地方和那个时代。你可以发现甜味。有些食物是天然甜的，但厨师无法创造甜味。

**因此，当谈到友谊是甜美的时，它谈论的不是你可以创造的东西，而是你发现的东西。**
