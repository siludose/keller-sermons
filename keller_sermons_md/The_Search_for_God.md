### Introduction: The Search for God

Have you ever found yourself asking, what if nothing I do really lasts? Is this all there is? In today's podcast, Tim Keller looks at how Ecclesiastes helps us face our doubts, fears, and uncertainties, and points us to the lasting hope and significance we have in Christ.

> "You can read from that with me. I'm going to read in Exodus chapter 1, you have verses 1 to 11. I'm going to read all the way down to 14. So when you get to the bottom of the page, just wait another eight seconds and it'll be over."

Exodus chapter 3 verses 1 to 14. Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the desert and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that through the bush, that though the bush was on fire, it did not burn up. So Moses thought, I will go over and see this strange sight, why the bush does not burn up.

**When the Lord saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, Moses, Moses. And Moses said, here I am.**

### The Burning Bush: A Paradigm Bomb

When Moses saw the burning bush, it was a disrupting event. It took him out of his normal course of action. **The burning bush is something that contradicts the model or view of reality that you've got.**

- A burning bush is something that is actually a paradigm bomb.
- It comes inside your paradigm of what things should be like and it explodes it.

### The Inexplicable: Turning Aside

A burning bush can come in many forms:

- An inexplicable person
- An inexplicable train of thought
- An inexplicable trouble
- An inexplicable emptiness

**You have to turn aside. You have to spend time. You have to read. You have to think you have to become vulnerable to a degree because you've got to talk to somebody about these things.**

### The Big Contradiction: Holiness and Love

God says to Moses, "Moses, Moses, do not come any closer." This is an incredible contradiction.

- **On the one hand, God is holy and just. On the other hand, He is loving and wants a relationship with us.**
- God is a burning bush, a contradiction at the heart of biblical religion.

### The Mediator: The Angel of the Lord

In the midst of the burning bush, there's an angel. **The angel was in the bush and yet the Lord spoke through the bush.**

- There was a mediator in the bush.
- Jesus Christ was consumed by the holy wrath of God, so we are able to become burning bushes ourselves.

**To the degree you see him burning in the bush, you'll become a bush that burns and is not consumed.**

Let's pray. We ask Father that you'd help us to apply these things. A lot of us are actually suffering right now and we're just grumpy about it. We're just mad about it. Instead of seeing that this is your way of turning us aside with contradictions and bringing us into the heart of the great contradiction, which is that the law was fulfilled by your love in Jesus Christ. We ask that you would change your hearts with these things and apply them to our lives through Jesus and his name we pray. Amen.

### 引言：寻找上帝

你是否曾问过自己，如果我所做的一切都没有持久的意义，那又如何？这就是全部吗？在今天的播客中，Tim Keller 探讨了传道书如何帮助我们面对疑虑、恐惧和不确定性，并指引我们在基督里找到持久的希望和意义。

> "你可以和我一起阅读。我将阅读出埃及记第一章，你有第1到11节。我将一直读到第14节。所以当你到达页面底部时，只需再等八秒钟就结束了。"

出埃及记第3章第1到14节。摩西牧养他岳父米甸祭司叶忒罗的羊群。他领羊群到旷野的尽头，来到神的山，就是何烈山。耶和华的使者从荆棘中火焰里向他显现。摩西见荆棘被火烧着，却没有烧毁。摩西说，我要过去看这大异象，这荆棘为何没有烧毁。

**耶和华见他过去要看，就从荆棘中呼叫说，摩西，摩西。他说，我在这里。**

### 燃烧的荆棘：范式炸弹

当摩西看到燃烧的荆棘时，这是一个扰乱事件。它将他从正常的行动轨道中带出。**燃烧的荆棘是与你的现实观念相矛盾的事物。**

- 燃烧的荆棘实际上是一个范式炸弹。
- 它进入你对事物应有样子的范式并将其炸毁。

### 不可解释的：转向

燃烧的荆棘可以以多种形式出现：

- 不可解释的人
- 不可解释的思路
- 不可解释的麻烦
- 不可解释的空虚

**你必须转向。你必须花时间。你必须阅读。你必须思考，你必须在某种程度上变得脆弱，因为你必须与某人谈论这些事情。**

### 大矛盾：圣洁与爱

上帝对摩西说：“摩西，摩西，不要再靠近。”这是一个令人难以置信的矛盾。

- **一方面，上帝是圣洁和公义的。另一方面，他是慈爱的，并希望与我们建立关系。**
- 上帝是燃烧的荆棘，是圣经宗教核心的矛盾。

### 中保：主的使者

在燃烧的荆棘中，有一个天使。**天使在荆棘中，但耶和华通过荆棘说话。**

- 荆棘中有一个中保。
- 耶稣基督被上帝的圣洁愤怒所消耗，因此我们能够成为燃烧的荆棘。

**在你看到他在荆棘中燃烧的程度上，你将成为一个燃烧而不被消耗的荆棘。**

让我们祷告。我们请求父亲帮助我们应用这些事情。我们中的许多人现在实际上正在受苦，我们对此感到不满。我们只是对此感到愤怒。相反，我们应该看到这是你通过矛盾转向我们的方式，并将我们带入伟大矛盾的核心，即律法在耶稣基督的爱中得以实现。我们请求你用这些事情改变我们的心，并通过耶稣和他的名应用到我们的生活中。阿门。
