### Introduction: The Human Condition

You don't have to look far to see that something's deeply wrong with our world and with us. But is there an answer that gets to the root of why? In today's message, Tim Keller explores the human condition through stories in the Bible, uncovering what Scripture says about sin and why it's the only explanation deep enough to face the truth about ourselves.

### God's Promise and Human Despondency

I'm going to read you from Isaiah chapter 49. I'm going to read verses 8 down to 16. It's in your bulletin. I'm going to read to verse 16. This is what the Lord says. In the time of my favor, I will answer you and in the time of day of salvation, I will help you. I will keep you and I will make you to be a covenant for the people to restore the land and to reassign its desolate inheritances to say to the captives, come out and to those in darkness be free. They will feed beside the roads and find pasture on every barren hill. They will neither hunger nor thirst, nor will the desert heat or the sun beat upon them. He who has compassion on them will guide them and lead them beside springs of water. I will turn all my mountains into roads and my highways will be raised up. See, they will come from afar, some from the north from this west, some from the region of Aswan. Shout for joy, oh heavens, rejoice so earth, burst into song, oh mountains, for the Lord comforts his people and will have compassion on his afflicted ones. But Zion said, the Lord has forsaken me, the Lord has forgotten me. Can a mother forget the baby at her breast had had no compassion on the child she has born? Though she may forget, I will not forget you. See, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands. Your walls are ever before me. Let's end there. This is God's Word.

### God's Response to Despondency

Now, if you've been coming over the weeks, you know, this is the actually end of a series on what the Bible has to say about what's wrong with the human heart, what's wrong with the human race, what the Bible calls sin. And if you're part of this series, you need to know that if you've been following this series, this is the ultimate cure. Well, we actually have here, let me remind you this when we've been in Isaiah for a while, what we have here is something written to people who are going to face our facing exile. The Jews had Jerusalem destroyed. That's the reason why there's discussion about Zion's wall. Zion was the hill on which the temple was built. And therefore, the word Zion can mean the city of Jerusalem. It sometimes can mean the temple, but the point is that when the Babylonian Empire came and besieged Jerusalem and destroyed it, everything was torn down. The walls of Jerusalem were torn down. The temple was torn down. The people were sent into captivity. And what Isaiah is giving us is a prophecy from the Lord to the people. And here he's asking, here he's answering the question. And the question is going to be, how can we face this? What are you going to do about this?

### The Nature of God's Love

First of all, God stops. That may not be as easy for you to see unless you read in the whole chapter, but God sees on his way. He's talking about things. And he's actually got, he's, verses 1 to 13 is really a wonderful, a wonderful, there's the structure of this discourse is wonderful. And I'm not even going to talk about it here tonight, because I don't think that's what we're going to, we're not going to dwell on that. But he actually talks about three great stages in history of salvation. He's moving from the cross to a new community to a new creation, from cross to community to new creation. It's really wonderful. And then suddenly he looks down and he says, any questions, I mean, this is like it like sure. He's I'm going on to say any questions. And somebody puts up their hand and say, I'm depressed. I'm despondent. I don't understand what you're talking about. I feel cast out. I feel like it's all over. God stops. Because verse 15, verse 16, in fact, all the rest of the chapter. God stops what he's saying. He changed the subject because they say, you've forgotten me and everything about the rest of the chapter is about that idea. In other words, God, God lets himself be interrupted. He stops. And that's very important.

### The Cross and God's Justice

Recently I have a, when I think about my own pastoral career, I realize that no matter what gender you are, no matter what race you are, no matter what age you are, we're all stupid in our own, special way. And when I was a young pastor, I had a tendency not to stop. When someone spoke despondently, there's a tendency to just pour on the theology. So, well, let me finish my lecture. Let me, you know, don't you know, you're just a fight by faith. You're adopted into the family. You're going to rule and reign. Don't you know, you're theology. It's when you're younger, when you're a younger band, when a younger pastor, there's a tendency to just say, well, I can fix this. Let me keep on going with my, my thing. You know, let me just pour the theology on. But God stops. Now, on the other hand, as I'm becoming an older minister, as it's obvious, I realize I still don't want to stop, but for different reasons. Well, you know, now when you see somebody despondent, in spite of all these great claims, now when you see someone say, I know what Christianity teaches, and I know what the Bible says, and I know all that, I'm still depressed. There's a tendency to look down and say, well, get over it. But you know, when you get older, you've seen people get through things and you say, come on, you'll survive. This will be all right. You know, what are you wallowing for? People have had much worse problems than you have, and you get through it, and I've been through. So when you're younger, it's a tendency not to stop and really listen, and when you get older, it's a tendency not to stop and really listen. I don't know when I'll be a good pastor. I do know this. God is interrupted. He stops. But the other general principle, he stops, but he argues, because verse 15 and 16 is an argument. Verse 15 and 16 is pugnacious. Verse 15 and 16 is contradicting what the despondent heart says, and this is a perfect balance, because on the other hand, he's got the compassion to stop, but he argues.

### Application: Living in God's Love

Now, here's the principle I mean. Before we move on to specifics, it's the general principle. If you don't listen to your heart, you'll be in psychological rubble. But if you only listen to your heart, you'll be in psychological rubble. If you don't listen to your heart, by the way, almost all of us fall into one of these or the other. One of these mistakes. Some of us just don't listen. We say, oh, well, you know, you, you, you deny it. You don't, you know, all that upset. I'm not angry. I'm not, I'm all right. I'm fine. And you just stay busy. And you don't sit down and listen to your heart. You don't listen to find out just how bad is it? And what's the cause of it? So a lot of us just, well, you know, we're kind of extroverts, you know, so let's get out and do things. You know, that'll, I'll just be fine. We don't listen to our heart. On the other hand, some of us do nothing but listen to our heart. We just let our heart forsaken, forgotten, forsaken, forgotten. You want chemistry? I'm forsaken. I'm forgot. Now listen, if you only listen to your heart and you never talk to it and you never grab hold of it and you say just the truth, you're out of touch with reality, buddy. I mean, you have to do that. If you don't, if you never listen to your heart and if you only listen to your heart, but see what God does is he stops to listen. He takes it very seriously, but he argues. And that's the general principles. However, what's the specific things he does with a despondent heart? And there's three things. And you know what? As I hinted at the beginning, these three things do not just cure a despondent heart, and this is the cure for a sinful heart. You know, the word forgotten for forsaken, the word for forsaken is kind of an external word. It has more to do with you haven't come through for me, but the word forgotten is more of an internal word, which is you've rejected me. For forsaken has more to do without a sight and forgotten, more out of mind. For forsaken, more is how can you have let these things happen to me? Forgotten is more like you've rejected me because there's something wrong, isn't there? I'm no good. And you know, sometimes despondency is made up more of anger than shame and sometimes it's made up more of shame than anger, but they're kissing cousins. They're very, very close. It's very hard to know, which is which sometimes. And so when God comes to the despondent sinful sick heart, he enjoins three things. He calls us to three things. And they're all here in verse 15 and 16, verse 15, 16 A and 16 B. Look, well, I'll just say what the three things are. He says, think of who you. Think of who I am. Look at what I have done. And practice who you are, okay? Think of who I am. Look at what I've done and practice who you are.

### Conclusion

Our Father, we ask that you would show us how this, how Jesus was destroyed by justice so that now justice is on our side, and your love for us is indestructible. Would you please show us how that works out? Would you please show us how we can apply that? Father, this is a strong medicine. It's the most difficult thing for many of us to grab hold on. We try to hold on to it, and we find that we have to beat it into our heads over and over again, and we lose our orientation towards so quickly. Would you, Lord, tonight, buy your grace and grave these truths into our hearts deeper than they've ever been engraved so that we can start to practice who we are and really see what you've done. We pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.

### 引言：人类的状况

你不需要走得太远就能看到我们的世界和我们自身有些深刻的问题。但是否有一个答案能深入探究其根源呢？在今天的信息中，Tim Keller 通过圣经中的故事探讨人类的状况，揭示圣经对罪的看法，以及为什么它是唯一足够深刻的解释，能够面对关于我们自身的真相。

### 神的应许与人类的沮丧

我要为你们读以赛亚书第49章。我将从第8节读到第16节。这在你的公告中。我将读到第16节。这是主说的。在我恩惠的时刻，我必应允你，在拯救的日子，我必帮助你。我必保守你，使你成为人民的约，恢复土地，重新分配荒凉的产业，对被掳的说，出来吧，对在黑暗中的说，自由吧。他们将在路旁吃草，在每个荒凉的山上找到牧场。他们既不饥饿也不口渴，沙漠的热气或太阳也不会打击他们。怜悯他们的必引导他们，带领他们到水泉旁。我必使我的一切山成为道路，我的高速公路将被抬高。看，他们将从远方来，有的从北方，有的从西方，有的从阿斯旺地区。欢呼吧，诸天，欢喜吧，大地，山岭啊，歌唱吧，因为主安慰他的百姓，将怜悯他的受苦者。但锡安说，主离弃了我，主忘记了我。母亲岂能忘记她怀中的婴孩，不怜悯她所生的孩子呢？即使她可能忘记，我也不会忘记你。看，我已将你铭刻在我手掌上。你的墙常在我面前。我们就到这里。这是神的话。

### 神对沮丧的回应

现在，如果你一直在来，你知道这是关于圣经对人类心灵的问题，人类种族的问题，圣经称之为罪的系列的结束。如果你是这个系列的一部分，你需要知道，如果你一直在跟随这个系列，这是最终的治愈。好吧，我们实际上在这里，让我提醒你，当我们在以赛亚书中待了一段时间时，我们在这里有一些写给将要面临流放的人们的东西。犹太人的耶路撒冷被摧毁。这就是为什么有关于锡安墙的讨论。锡安是建造圣殿的山。因此，锡安这个词可以指耶路撒冷城。有时可以指圣殿，但重点是，当巴比伦帝国来围攻耶路撒冷并摧毁它时，一切都被拆毁了。耶路撒冷的墙被拆毁了。圣殿被拆毁了。人们被送入了囚禁。以赛亚给我们的是主对人民的预言。在这里，他在问，在回答问题。问题将是，我们如何面对这一切？你打算怎么做？

### 神爱的本质

首先，神停下来。除非你读完整章，否则这可能不容易看到，但神在他的路上看到了。他在谈论事情。他实际上已经有了，他，1到13节实际上是一个美妙的，美妙的，这个话语的结构是美妙的。我今晚甚至不打算在这里谈论它，因为我不认为那是我们要做的，我们不会在那上面停留。但他实际上谈到了救赎历史的三个伟大阶段。他从十字架转向一个新社区，再到一个新创造，从十字架到社区到新创造。这真的很美妙。然后突然他低下头说，有问题吗，我的意思是，这就像是，他继续说，有问题吗。有人举手说，我很沮丧。我很绝望。我不明白你在说什么。我感到被抛弃。我觉得一切都结束了。神停下来。因为第15节，第16节，事实上，整章的其余部分。神停下他说的话。他改变了主题，因为他们说，你忘记了我，整章的其余部分都是关于这个想法。换句话说，神，让自己被打断。他停下来。这很重要。

### 十字架与神的公义

最近，当我想到我自己的牧师生涯时，我意识到无论你是什么性别，无论你是什么种族，无论你是什么年龄，我们都以自己的特殊方式愚蠢。当我还是个年轻牧师时，我倾向于不停下来。当有人说得很沮丧时，有一种倾向就是倾倒神学。所以，让我完成我的讲座。让我，你知道，你不知道，你只是靠信心争斗。你被收养进了家庭。你将统治和统治。你不知道，你的神学。当你年轻时，当你是一个年轻的乐队，当一个年轻的牧师时，有一种倾向就是继续说，好吧，我可以解决这个问题。让我继续我的事情。你知道，让我只是倾倒神学。但神停下来。另一方面，当我成为一个年长的牧师时，显然，我意识到我仍然不想停下来，但出于不同的原因。好吧，你知道，现在当你看到有人沮丧时，尽管有这些伟大的主张，现在当你看到有人说，我知道基督教教导什么，我知道圣经说什么，我知道所有这些，我仍然很沮丧。有一种倾向就是低下头说，好吧，克服它。但你知道，当你变老时，你看到人们度过了事情，你说，来吧，你会活下去。这会没事的。你知道，你在为什么沉溺？人们有比你更糟糕的问题，你度过了，我也度过了。所以当你年轻时，有一种倾向就是不停下来真正倾听，当你变老时，有一种倾向就是不停下来真正倾听。我不知道我什么时候会成为一个好牧师。我知道这一点。神被打断了。他停下来。但另一个一般原则，他停下来，但他争论，因为第15和16节是一个争论。第15和16节是好斗的。第15和16节是与沮丧的心相矛盾的，这是一个完美的平衡，因为另一方面，他有同情心停下来，但他争论。

### 应用：活在神的爱中

现在，这就是我所说的原则。在我们进入具体之前，这是一般原则。如果你不听你的心，你会在心理废墟中。但如果你只听你的心，你会在心理废墟中。如果你不听你的心，顺便说一下，我们几乎所有人都落入其中一个或另一个。这些错误之一。有些人就是不听。我们说，哦，好吧，你知道，你，你，你否认它。你不知道，所有那些不安。我不生气。我没事。我很好。你只是保持忙碌。你不坐下来听你的心。你不听以找出到底有多糟糕？是什么原因？所以我们中的很多人只是，好吧，你知道，我们有点外向，你知道，所以让我们出去做事情。你知道，那会，我会很好。我们不听我们的心。另一方面，我们中的一些人只听我们的心。我们只是让我们的心被遗弃，被遗忘，被遗弃，被遗忘。你想要化学吗？我被遗弃。我被遗忘。现在听着，如果你只听你的心，你从不与它交谈，你从不抓住它，你说只是事实，你与现实脱节，伙计。我的意思是，你必须这样做。如果你不这样做，如果你从不听你的心，如果你只听你的心，但看看神所做的是他停下来听。他非常认真地对待它，但他争论。这是一般原则。然而，神对沮丧的心做了什么具体的事情？有三件事。你知道吗？正如我在开始时暗示的，这三件事不仅治愈了沮丧的心，这是对罪恶心的治愈。你知道，被遗忘的词语，遗弃的词语，遗弃的词语有点外在的词语。它更多地与您没有为我挺身而出有关，但被遗忘的词语更多的是内在的词语，即您拒绝了我。遗弃更多地与视线无关，被遗忘更多地与心灵无关。遗弃更多的是你怎么能让这些事情发生在我身上？被遗忘更像是你拒绝了我，因为有些事情不对，不是吗？我不好。你知道，有时沮丧更多地由愤怒组成，而不是羞耻，有时它更多地由羞耻组成，而不是愤怒，但它们是亲密的表亲。它们非常，非常接近。有时很难知道，哪个是哪个。因此，当神来到沮丧的罪恶病态的心时，他命令三件事。他召唤我们做三件事。它们都在第15和16节，第15，16 A和16 B中。看，好吧，我只会说这三件事是什么。他说，想想你是谁。想想我是谁。看看我做了什么。并实践你是谁，好吗？想想我是谁。看看我做了什么，并实践你是谁。

### 结论

我们的父，我们请求你向我们展示这如何，耶稣如何被公义摧毁，以便现在公义站在我们这一边，你对我们的爱是坚不可摧的。你能否请展示这如何发挥作用？你能否请展示我们如何应用它？父亲，这是一个强大的药物。这是许多人最难抓住的东西。我们试图抓住它，我们发现我们必须一遍又一遍地将它打入我们的头脑中，我们很快就失去了方向。主啊，今晚，凭你的恩典，将这些真理铭刻在我们心中，比以往任何时候都更深，以便我们可以开始实践我们是谁，并真正看到你所做的。我们奉耶稣的名祈祷。阿门。
