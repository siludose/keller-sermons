**Introduction:**

Welcome to Gospel in Life. During January, we're inviting our listeners to consider becoming a Gospel in Life monthly partner. If you'd like to learn more, keep listening at the end of today's podcast for details. Have you ever wondered what it really means to live a great life? The Bible says the Ten Commandments aren't confining rules, but a framework for building a life of true greatness. Today, Tim Keller takes an in-depth look at one of the Ten Commandments and helps us understand what it means to live the way God designed us to, free, whole, and rooted in His love. The reading today is taken from the book of Deuteronomy, chapter 5, verses 6-21 and 24-29. I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them, for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sins of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments. You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name. Observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy, as the Lord your God has commanded you. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant, nor your ox, your donkey, or any of your animals, nor the alien within your gates, so that your manservant and maidservant may rest, as you do. Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the Lord your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore, the Lord your God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day. Honor your father and your mother, as the Lord your God has commanded you, so that you may live long and that it may go well with you in the land the Lord your God is giving you. You shall not commit murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife. You shall not set your desire on your neighbor's house or land, his manservant or maidservant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor. And you said, The Lord our God has shown us his glory and his majesty, and we have heard his voice from the fire. Today, we have seen that a man can live even if God speaks with him. But now, why should we die? This great fire will consume us, and we will die if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any longer. For what mortal man has ever heard the voice of the living God speaking out of fire, as we have, and survived? Go near and listen to all that the Lord our God says. Then tell us whatever the Lord our God tells you. We will listen and obey. The Lord heard you when you spoke to me, and the Lord said to me, I have heard what this people said to you. Everything they said was good. Oh, that their hearts would be inclined to fear me and keep all my commands always, so that it might go well with them and their children forever. This is the word of the Lord. We started to look at the Book of Deuteronomy. Book of Deuteronomy is a series of sermons that Moses preached just before he died, and in it, he lays out in the most comprehensive and practical way how you should live if you experience the grace and salvation of God. If you experience God, how should that actually affect the way in which you live your life? It's a very, very, very practical book, and an incredibly comprehensive book. Now today, we get to the Ten Commandments. This is one of the most influential texts in the entire history of the world, God's Law, Ten Commandments. And even though it's also mentioned in Exodus 20, this exposition of it here in Deuteronomy 5 is really the most complete exposition and explanation of God's Law, the Ten Commandments, that there is anywhere in the Bible. So let's take a look and see what we're taught about it. It's awfully basic, but it's awfully basic because it's awfully important, so we have to look at it. Now there's four things I think we're going to learn here about God's Law. The origin of God's Law, the origin of the Law, the substance of the Law, the problem of the Law, and the solution to that problem. The origin, the substance, the problem of the Law that every culture has to deal with, and the solution. **The Origin of God's Law:**

Okay, first, the origin. Notice in verse 16 when it talks about honoring father and mother, it says, I want you to honor your father and mother that things will go well with you. But that is not only, that promise, as it were, is not only attached to that command because at the very end, the last verse, verse 29, it says, I wish that you would always do all of my commands that things may go well with you. And that word well, going well, doesn't just mean, you know, things go smoother, it means full flourishing. And this is the first and very important thing to understand. What is God's Law? Is it a set of arbitrary decrees that God has come up with? You know, a king could come up with a whole set of decrees just to try to make sure his subjects keep off the streets, stay busy, just to prove their loyalty. You know, the king sits down and says, well, okay, I'll have them do this, I'll have them do this, I'll have them do this. In no way should you understand God's Law like that. Of course God makes decrees. But the Law of God is an expression of his actual nature. So when God says, don't lie or bear false witness, he says that because he doesn't lie, because he is a God of integrity, because he is a God of truth, and he is utterly consistent. But since you and I are made in his image, you know what that means. The Law of God then, therefore, reflects our nature. It's extremely important. Hear this. It reflects our nature. We were made in his image, and if the Law expresses his nature, then it actually reflects what we need to be to be fully who we are. So for example, think about lying for just one second. All kinds of scholars have understood over the years that you have to have truth and trust in a society for there to be any kind of economic life, civic life, family life, life. We have to be able to trust that what's being told to us is true, or everything breaks down. You know, when the Soviet Union essentially collapsed from within, there was a lot of analysis, but everybody mentioned at least one thing, and that is that nobody could trust anything they read. Nobody could trust anything they heard. They couldn't even trust the weather reports. They couldn't trust anything. And as a result, there was absolute breakdown. Why? Because when God says, don't lie, he's not giving you busy work. It's not an arbitrary decree. He's saying, to lie goes against your nature as human beings, as what I made you. And therefore, to violate the Law of God violates you. If a doctor, let's just say you've got high cholesterol or you've got incredibly bad, you know, you've got a heart problem, and if your doctor says, don't you eat X, Y, Z. If you do eat X, Y, Z, nobody's going to give you a fine. Nobody's going to come and give you a ticket. Nobody's going to come and put you in jail. They won't have to, because the consequences are natural. If you violate your doctor's order, you're violating your own nature and you're unraveling your own fabric. And God is saying that here. He says, don't think of the Law of God as arbitrary decrees. The Law of God outlines who you are. To violate the Law of God sets up strains in the fabric of reality that only lead to breakdown. The Law of God outlines the kind of life in which you will find who you really are, will find your absolute being. You will finally flourish. That's number one. Very important. So there we see the origin of God's law. It's in the nature of God and in the nature of our own being, and to violate it violates our own being, and to fulfill it fulfills yourself. Number one. **The Substance of God's Law:**

Another thing I want to look at here is the substance of God's law, and here's what I mean by that. During the next few months, we're going to be looking at what Deuteronomy says, and the middle part of Deuteronomy is actually an exposition of each of these laws, the Ten Commandments. So there's no need for me to go down and say, this means this. I'm not going to go through right now and say each commandment means this. What I want you to see is something that I usually don't notice, that I don't think many people notice, and that is how all these commandments hang together. I want you for a minute to see that they all are absolutely interdependent. When I first became a Christian, one of the Bible verses that really bugged me was James chapter 2 verse 10, and in James 2 verse 10 it says, if you're trying to obey God's law, but you violate it at any point, you've broken all of God's law. If you violate the law of God at any point, you've broken all of God's law, and that bugged me because I felt like, look, if 9 out of 10 isn't bad today, you know, and if I've kept 9 out of 10 laws, I want some credit. What does it matter with this God, 90%? That's an A. It used to be. And I wanted to know something about that, see. And now I realize I really got it wrong. James wasn't saying, oh, God doesn't grade on a curve. What James is trying to say is you actually can't break one law without breaking them all, and you can't keep one law without keeping them all, that they're much more interdependent than you ever thought. Let me explain. First of all, let me show you three combinations, three ways in which the Ten Commandments combine. First of all, they combine the vertical and the horizontal. Now that's one that you've probably heard. The first table of the law, Laws 1, Commands 1 to 4, are about God. How do I honor God? And how do I love Him with all my heart, soul, strength, and mind? So the first four commands are about how do I honor and love God with all my heart, soul, strength, and mind. The next table of the law, which is Commandments 5 through 10, are horizontal. How do I love my neighbor as myself? How do I honor their personhood? And so there you have horizontal, how do I love my neighbor as myself, vertical, how do I love the Lord God with all my heart, soul, and strength, and mind? So it combines the horizontal and the vertical. It's not just spiritual, it's not just social, it's both. It's not just personal and spiritual, it's not just external and social, it's both. That's the first combination. Second combination you may not have thought of, at least I haven't until fairly recently. It also covers the inner and the outer. It covers the inner, psychological, spiritual, motivational, as well as the external and practical. **The Inner and the Outer:**

Now, I want you to think this. Now, we actually talked about this last week, and we'll keep talking about it because Deuteronomy brings it up all the time. Commandments 1 and 2, where it says, have no other gods before me and make no graven image of anything, whether birds or fish or sun, moon, stars. Worship no graven image. Have no other gods before me. That is talking about your very heart of hearts. If anything is more important to your hope, your meaning in life, your self-worth, and your security than God's love, you're sinning. Now, we've talked about this before, but let me give you one more illustration. I occasionally use this, but it's one of my favorite ones. Many, many years ago, there was a girl in our youth group back in Virginia, and some of you have heard me say this before, but I think this will still bring this home. She was 15, I think, or something like that, and she was sitting there saying how discouraged she was about her whole life, and so we went through being a 25-year-old pastor. I gave her theology, and I said, you know, are you a Christian? Yes. I'm born again, and I have the righteousness of Christ, and I have the Father's love, and I have a guaranteed place of new heavens and new earth, and then she says, but you know what good is all that if the boys don't even know I'm alive? Now, cute, right? Right. Titter, titter, titter. That's great. Okay, but here's what she was doing. Did she not believe in the gospel? Did she not believe in God and all these great things? Yeah, but God was on audio, and the boys were on video. I mean, if you're listening to something on audio at the same time you're watching a movie, you know, something on video, what's going to win? What's going to get your attention? It's going to be the movie, not the audio, right? It's going to be the image, not the sound. She believed in God, but boys had captured her imagination. Imagination, image. Boys had grabbed her heart. Boys were more important to who she was and herself, which by the way is true of just about any 15-year-old girl probably. I mean, I'm not trying to pick on her, but you see why the Ten Commandments are getting at the very heart of things. What turns your crank? What captures your imagination? What is your real motivation? Why do you really get up in the morning? What is your real hope? What is your real meaning in life? What is it? Is it anything more than God's love? Now that's the first thing the commandments are after. So it's talking about the inner. And then in Commandment 10, it gives you the sign. How do you know if there's something more important to you than God? Lack of contentment. Yes, Commandment 10 says, thou shalt not covet, but do you know what that means? That's a command to be content. If you love God more than anything else, when you look out there at the things you don't have, you might say, I like them, but they won't drive you. They won't gnaw at you. The Tenth Commandment is a command to have inner peace. The Tenth Commandment is a call to love God enough to be content. Everybody wants success. Everybody wants a relationship. Everybody wants to be loved. Everybody wants achievement. But if God's your ultimate comfort, your ultimate concern, your ultimate security, then when you don't have the money and you don't have the relationship and you don't have these things, they won't call you. Now if you have made that inner transformation, and that's amazing, if you put God at the very center of your heart, then you can keep the Sabbath day. See, let's go to the external now. Why? Because if you're content, you won't overwork. Then you won't commit adultery, because if you're content, you won't use sex as a way of self-fulfillment and self-realization, but only as a way of doing, building commitment with another person in marriage and building community. See, only if you have the inner transformation will you be able to do all these other things that the commandments say you should do. So in a way, you know, the Ten Commandments command that you be born again. The Ten Commandments command an inner transformation and an inner peace and contentment, as well as all these practicals. So here you see the commands not only combine the vertical and the horizontal, but it combines the inner and the outer, and last of all, and briefly, it also combines the individual and the personal and the corporate. You know, in our culture right now, there's very often values are fragmented. You've got a group of people over there who stress caring about the poor and justice and equity and including everybody. But when it comes to the personal morality, that's social morality, but when it comes to personal morality, you know, what you do with your sexuality is your business. And then over here, you've got a bunch of people who talk about traditional values and, you know, being religious and being moral and not committing adultery and all those sorts of things. But when it comes to concern for the poor and all that, that seems to be not so important. But if you actually read the Ten Commandments and understand what they're all saying, and we're going to see that over the months, there's a combination here. You know, Commandment 2 is no false religion. Commandment 4 is honor your father and your mother, traditional family values, no adultery. But on the other hand, thou shalt not steal, as we will see later on, means caring for the economic well-being of everyone. Thou shalt not kill means not harming anyone, caring for their physical safety and their physical conditions. You're going to see that when it comes to thou shalt not kill, it means caring about the hungry. And therefore, there's this combination. Even the Sabbath, as you can see, if you look carefully there, is really an act of liberation. If you overwork, you are a cog in an economic system. It's using you and exploiting you, even if you're doing it voluntarily. And therefore, there's cultural analysis here, and social analysis, and religious theological analysis, and individual personal morality, and social morality. It's all there. Now, let's go back here for a second to James chapter 2, verse 10, and you see what it means? When he says, if you break one, you break them all? They're all interdependent. For example, what if you say, oh, I'm very good. I go to church, and I read my Bible, and I pray, and I honor God, I honor God, I honor God. Now, I'm abusive to my employees, I'm harsh, I'm nasty, I'm unkind, I'm cruel to people, but I love God. See, wait a minute. If you say, I'm okay at the first part of the commandments, I'm honoring God, but I just don't love people. You're not honoring God if you don't love people. They all are of a piece. You can't keep commandments 1 to 4 without keeping commandments 5 through 10. Or you say, well, I lied, well, I stole, but at least I didn't commit idolatry, and we talked about this last week. You always commit idolatry if you lie or steal or break any of the other commandments. Why would you lie unless you made approval, or saving face, or money, or something like that, more important than God? You wouldn't lie, you wouldn't steal, you wouldn't do anything wrong if God was actually absolutely first in your life. You wouldn't need to. You wouldn't have to. There'd be no motivation to. You see, they're all of a piece. You can't actually keep one without keeping them all. You can't break one without breaking them all. We all chase things like success, true love, or the perfect life, good things that can easily become ultimate things. When we put our faith in them, deep down, we know they can't satisfy our deepest longings. The truth is that we've made lesser gods of good things, things that can't give us what we really need. In his book, Counterfeit Gods, The Empty Promises of Money, Sex, and Power, and the Only Hope That Matters, Tim Keller shows us how a proper understanding of the Bible reveals the truth about societal ideals and our own hearts, and shows us that there is only one God who can wholly satisfy our desires. This month, we'll send you Counterfeit Gods as our thank you for your gift to help Gospel & Life share the love of Christ with people all over the world.

So there's the substance, the interdependence of the Ten Commandments. It's not the sort of thing we usually talk about, because we have almost immediately when we're teaching, then we break them down and say, well, this commandment means this and this and this, and we'll get there. But I want to show you that they are all of a piece. Isn't that amazing? But that leads us to our third point. It leads us to our third point, which is the problem of the law. If you want to have an understanding of the problem of the law, you take a look at verse 24 and 25. Here's the first response. This is what the children of Israel said as soon as they heard it. Notice what they say. The Lord our God has shown us his glory and his majesty. We have heard his voice from the fire. But now, why should we die? The great fire will consume us, and we will die if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any longer. Now, notice what they're saying. To hear God out of the fire is wonderful and yet terrible. It's great! What an honor! And we don't want any more of it. We talked about this last week. The fire of God is the beautiful danger of the absolute holiness and perfection of God. But here's what they're seeing. It's what you feel whenever anybody... You know, I didn't even go through the Ten Commandments, did I? I didn't even really go through and exactly explain what they all are. But even when you do the little summary I just gave you, you start to feel the weight of it. And here's the problem of the law. Here's the problem they felt. On the one hand, when you hear the law of God, you say, of course, of course I should live like that. C.S. Lewis, in his book The Abolition of Man, in the very back there's an appendix in which he shows that the Ten Commandments are essentially held by all the religions of the world. As different as the religions of the world are, and boy are they all, are they, on who's God? And who are we? And where do we come from? And how can we be saved? The religions of the world are absolutely different on all those things. And when you ask them, how should we live in the world, there's almost a complete consensus. The Ten Commandments are virtually common sense. Romans 2 says they're written on our hearts, no matter who we are. And Lewis makes a pretty good case of it. So on the one hand, when you hear the law of God, you say, of course I should live like this. How could I not live like this? But on the other hand, you say, but I can't live like this. The law of God, the children of Israel realized, is something they can't live with and they can't live without. They can't live with it and they can't live without it. And this is a problem that every culture has to deal with in different ways. And yet every culture plays out. Let me give you a real quick example, a very brief example of this. Today, you have what's often called culture wars. And the culture wars, to a great degree, have to do with this idea, is there a divine moral absolute? Is there a set of divine absolute moral laws that all people must obey that are true for everyone? Now, on the one hand, you have the secular people who are saying no, that morality is relative to the individual and it's relative to the culture. And there is no set of divine moral absolutes that are true for everybody. And if you think you've got them, and if you think you've got the truth, you're the problem with the world. On the other side, we have traditional people. And traditional people say there is. Traditional people tend to be religious. They come from various religions. And they say, yes, of course there is a divine law. Of course there is a set of moral absolutes. And you relativists, you people who don't believe in them, you're the problem with the world. But both those positions have severe problems. And I mean severe problems. Because on the one hand, the secularists, if you say to the secularists, tell me, if there is no God and we just evolved, on what basis can you say that it's right to be kind and wrong to be cruel? On what basis? How can you say, you know, how can you impose your views on other people? And it's a difficulty. On the other hand, the religious people have a terrible record of oppression and using the warrant that they have the truth to harm other people. And I think this all came together, to me, in a way, in a little, it was actually not a whole article, but part of an article I read in the New York Times Magazine not too long ago, in which it said that a university in Israel, back in 2003, did a study of all their religious, of all their communes. You know, they have hundreds of communes around Israel. And in those communes, some are religious and some are secular. And the religious ones were doing far better than the secular ones, economically. And they did a kind of thorough study and they discovered something. Namely, that secular people, especially secular men, especially secular males, secular people are far more selfish and individualistic than religious people. And that's one of the reasons why the communes didn't do very well. But you see the nub of the problem? Secularism makes people individualistic and selfish. But religion makes people tribal, divisive, self-righteous. See without the law, if everything's relative, then why not live any way I want? But with the law, when I've got the truth, then I feel like I can bash people. So secularism makes people individualistic and selfish, but religion tends to make people tribal. **The Solution - God's Unfulfilled Longing:**

What are we going to do? We can't live with the law of God and we can't live without it. It's the same thing that the children of Israel had a problem with. What's the answer? Here it is. One of the most amazing things about this whole passage is verse 29. Because in verse 29, God speaks and says, oh that this people, oh that this people would be inclined to fear me and keep all my commands always, so it might go well with them. Even in English, it looks like God's getting emotional. This consuming fire is getting emotional. Oh, that these people would incline their hearts to fear me, and boy that he is. First of all, the word fear is not what you think it means, because in English it means to be afraid. But in the Old Testament, in Hebrew in the Old Testament, it actually means the opposite. To fear someone is to experience awe and wonder before the grace and glory of something. It's like to be enraptured by an incredible piece of music or an incredible piece of art. That's what it means. And here's what God is saying. Oh that my people would want to obey me out of love. Oh that my people would not just obey me because they're afraid of me, because they know they have to, but because they love me. And the Hebrew actually is even more nuanced than that. Because Chris Wright in his commentary on Deuteronomy points out that the Hebrew phrase that is rendered here, oh that, so that's an English way of getting across a Hebrew phrase. But oh that means unfulfilled longing. And we have a number of places in the Old Testament, like Isaiah 48 and Jeremiah 2 and Hosea 11, where God says oh that, and what it means is how I long, how I weep with unfulfilled desire that my people would not just obey because they have to, but because they want to. Not just obey because I'm God, but because I'm your God. And one of the most obvious things I realized as I was looking through this passage just last night actually, was one term is used throughout the law of God more than any other term and that is this preposition. Verse 6, I'm the Lord your God. Verse 9, I'm the Lord your God. Verse 11, I'm the Lord your God. Verse 12, I'm the Lord your God. Verse 13, I'm the Lord your God. 15, your God. 16, twice your God. And then of course Moses keeps saying he's the Lord our God over and over again. Why? When you hear somebody say my John or my Susie, you know immediately we're talking about, you know, I don't know, husband, wife, child, sibling, somebody incredibly close. And this is what God is saying. I don't want you to obey me because I'm God. I want you to obey me because I'm your God. I want there to be intimacy. I want there to be love. This is an amazing thing. Why did he give us the law? Why did he say to get us to submit to him? No. That's why you and I would do it. But he's God. If he wants to get us to submit to him, all he's got to do is snap his fingers and we've got to do it, you know? We couldn't help it. He couldn't possibly be giving us the law to make us submit. He doesn't need to do that. Why would he be giving us the law? He's telling us. He says I want a love relationship with you. If you obey me, that's you giving me love and it's also me giving you love because this fulfills your deepest being. Oh, that my people would say not I obey you because you're God, but I obey you because you're my God. **Jesus - The Ultimate Law Fulfiller:**

Is there any hope for this vision? It's unfulfilled longing. He knows this isn't happening. Centuries later, a man comes to Jerusalem, looks at Jerusalem, and begins to weep in Luke 19, 41, and says, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, oh, that you would know the things that pertain to your peace, but now they're hidden from your eyes. It's Jesus. And one week later, he went to the cross. Why? To pay the penalty for our breaches of the law. To pay the penalty for our sins, the way in which we fail to obey the law. Okay, you've always heard that? Yeah, but here's something I don't know that we know enough, or know well enough, or maybe know at all. When he was on the cross, he was forsaken. Now psychologists will tell you the worst thing that can happen to you is to be forsaken by someone that you love. Death of a spouse or divorce are the two worst things that can happen to a human being, but compared to that, to compare to this, that's nothing. Because the Father and the Son had known and loved each other for all eternity, and on the cross, Jesus is forsaken. He's experiencing the penalty for breaking the law. He's dying the death we should die. But when he goes to the cross, here's the question, why? He didn't have to go to the cross. He tells you the reason, because when he cries out, he doesn't say, God, God, why have you forsaken me? He says, my God, my God, why has thou forsaken me? That's covenant language. That's deliberate covenant language. And well, you know what that means? On the cross, Jesus Christ was not just dying the death we should have died, but living the life we should have lived. Jesus Christ was fulfilling the law. He is being, he is doing what God wants us to do. My God, do you realize what he was doing when he went to the cross to die for our sins? He was loving the Lord his God with all his heart, soul, strength, and mind in a way no one ever has. No one's ever been sent to hell and still loved God. You know, Ahab says, from hell's heart I stab at thee. Remember Captain Ahab? From hell's heart I stab at thee. But that was just a metaphor. Jesus Christ was literally in hell, and he said, from hell's heart, I'm still loving you. I'm faithful to you. There's, no one's ever loved the Lord his God with all his heart, soul, strength, and mind like that, and no one ever loved his neighbor like that, because he went to hell for you and me. He was fulfilling the law perfectly, fulfilling the law completely in a way that no one else ever has. And that's why when 2 Corinthians 5.21 says God made him sin that we, that who knew no sin that we might become the righteousness of God in him, it means not only is our sins put on him and he's given what we deserve, but his righteousness comes to us, his obedience, the fulfillment of the law comes to us. Now God treats us as if we'd done everything he'd ever done. And that means two things. One is, I don't have to be afraid to obey the law, because I'm accepted because of what Jesus Christ has done. I don't have to be afraid. I can go to the law out of delight. I know I'll be imperfect about it, but I won't have to feel incredibly guilty all the time because even my imperfect obedience to the law is a way to begin to love the one who did this for me. And secularism makes people individualistic and selfish, and religion makes people tribal, but the gospel humbles you out of selfishness and humbles you out of being tribal and superior and turns you outward to serve others, walking in the footsteps of the one who died for his enemies. **Conclusion:**

Our pleasure and our duty, though opposite before, since we have seen his beauty, are joined apart no more. To see the law by Christ fulfilled and hear his pardoning voice transforms a slave into a child and duty into choice. Jesus Christ was the ultimate covenant keeper so that we covenant breakers, he was the ultimate law fulfiller so that we law breakers can now obey the law out of love and gratitude with relief and a lack of fear, with only joy, so we can please and resemble and delight the one who did that for us. Let's pray. Our Father, the law of God is exceeding broad and incredibly powerful and impossible to live with without Jesus, but with Jesus, when we see him fulfilling that law, now we want to obey the law and we're not afraid of trying. We want to obey it and we're not afraid of trying and failing, because we will. It just transforms completely our whole approach to the law, and we ask that you would help us to keep these things in mind so that we don't get back into the problem that everyone else has who doesn't understand the gospel, either the problem of throwing the law off and there's so much devastation that comes when we just go away from it, or trying to obey it and there's so much guilt and pride and anxiety that comes from doing that. Father, we'll never overcome our problem with the law unless we understand that Jesus Christ on the cross loved you with all his heart, soul, strength, and mind, loved us neighbors as himself in unsurpassable ways, in our place, in our stead, on our behalf, so that now we know there's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. Help us take all this in. Let it move us. Let it change us. We pray in Jesus' name, amen. Thanks for listening to Tim Keller on the Gospel in Life podcast.

**引言：**

欢迎来到《福音生活》。在一月份，我们邀请听众考虑成为《福音生活》的月捐伙伴。如果你想了解更多信息，请在今天的播客结束时继续收听。你是否曾想过，过一个伟大人生到底意味着什么？圣经告诉我们，十诫并不是约束我们的规定，而是建造真正伟大生活的框架。今天，蒂姆·凯勒会深入解读其中一条诫命，帮助我们明白按照神的设计生活的意义，在祂的爱中自由、完整并扎根。今天的经文选自《申命记》第五章6-21节和24-29节。

“我是耶和华你的神，曾把你从埃及地为奴之家领出来。除了我以外，你不可有别的神。不可为自己雕刻偶像，也不可作任何形象，无论是在天上地上，还是地底下水中的。一概不可跪拜，也不可侍奉，因为我耶和华你的神是忌邪的神，恨我的，我必追讨他的罪，自父及子，直到三四代；爱我守我诫命的，我必向他们发慈爱，直到千代。不可妄称耶和华你神的名，因耶和华必不以妄称他名的人为无罪。要照耶和华你神所吩咐的，守安息日为圣日。六日要劳碌作你一切工，但第七日是向耶和华你神当守的安息日，哪一天，你和你的儿女、仆婢、牛驴，并你城门里寄居的客旅，无论何工都不可作，使仆婢可以和你一样得享安息。你也要记念自己在埃及地作过奴仆，耶和华你神用大能的手、伸出来的膀臂将你领出来，因此耶和华你的神吩咐你守安息日。要照耶和华你神所吩咐的孝敬父母，使你得福，并使你的日子在耶和华你神所赐的地上得以长久。不可杀人。不可奸淫。不可偷盗。不可作假见证陷害邻舍。不可贪恋邻舍的妻子；也不可贪图邻舍的房屋、田地、仆婢、牛驴，或是一切属乎邻舍的。”

你们说：“我们神的耶和华将他的荣耀和伟大给我们看见，我们又听见他的声音从火中发出。我们且见神与人说话，人还存活。那么，我们为何要死呢？这大火必烧灭我们，我们若再听见耶和华我们神的声音就必死亡。凡属血气的人，曾有谁听见永生神的声音从火中发出来，像我们听见还能存活呢？你进前去，听耶和华我们神所说的一切话，将耶和华我们神对你说的话传给我们，我们必听从行。”

耶和华听见你们对我说的话，就对我说：“我听见这百姓对你所说的话，他们说得很好。惟愿他们常存这样的心，敬畏我，谨守我的一切诫命，使他们和他们的子孙永远得福。”

这就是主的话。我们开始看《申命记》。《申命记》是摩西在去世前所讲的一系列讲道，其中以最全面和实际的方式展示了如果你经历了神的恩典和拯救，你应该如何生活。如果你真的经历了神，那应当如何影响你的生活方式？这是一卷非常实用的书，也是一本极为全面的书。今天我们要谈十诫，这是世界历史上最有影响力的文本之一，是神的律法，十诫。虽然《出埃及记》20章也提到了这段经文，但在《申命记》5章中的解释却是最完整的说明。因此，让我们来看一下这一段经文教导了我们什么。它看似基本，但正因为它极其重要，所以我们必须仔细看它。我认为我们将在这里学到关于神的律法的四方面：神律法的起源，律法的内容，律法的问题，以及如何解决这个问题。律法的来源、内容，所有文化都要面对的律法问题，以及解决方案。

**神的律法的起源：**

首先，律法的起源。注意在第16节提到要孝敬父母，说：“使你得福。”但这不仅适用于该诫命，因为在最后一节，第29节说：“惟愿你们始终遵行我一切的诫命，使你们永远得福。”那个“得福”不只是意味着事情变得更顺利，而是完全的繁荣。这是第一个也是非常重要的一点：神的律法是什么？它是神随便想出来的一系列规定吗？要知道，一个国王能写出一整套法律来确保他的子民听话保持忙碌，以此证明忠诚。国王坐下来，随便规定一些事宜。但你绝不能如此理解神的律法。当然，神确实颁布了命令，但神的律法是他自身本质的表达。所以当神说不要撒谎或作假见证时，那是因为他不撒谎，因为他是一个诚信的神，他是一个真实的神，而且完全一致。既然你我都是按他的形象受造，这意味着什么呢？神的律法因此反映了我们的本性。这一点极为重要。请注意，它反映了我们的本性。我们是按祂的形象被造，而如果律法表达了他的本性，那么它实际上反映了我们需要成为什么样才能完全成为我们自己的样子。比如，想到撒谎，各种学者多年来已经理解，你必须在一个社会里拥有真理和信任，才会有任何经济生活、公民生活、家庭生活，任何生活。我们必须相信告诉我们的东西是真实的，否则一切都崩溃。苏联在内崩解时，分析中提到至少有一点，那就是人们无法相信任何他们读到或听到的信息，甚至连天气预报都不可信，结果导致彻底的崩溃。为什么？因为当神说不要撒谎时，他不是在给你找事做，也不是随便的一条命令。

他说，撒谎违背了作为人类的本性，违背了我创造你的样子。因此，违背神的律法就是违背你自己。如果一个医生，假设你有高胆固醇或者严重的心脏问题，他告诉你不要吃某些食物。如果你吃了，没有人会罚款你，没有人会给你开罚单，也没有人会把你关进监狱。因为后果是自然的。如果你不遵从医生的建议，就是在违背自身的本性，是在破坏自己的身体构造。神在这里也是这样说的。他说，不要把神的律法视为随意的命令。神的律法勾勒出你的本质。违背神的律法是在现实的结构中造成张力，只会导致崩溃。神的律法指出了一种生活方式，能让你找到真正的自己，实现你自己的存在，你会最终蓬勃发展。这是第一点，非常重要。我们看到神的律法的起源是基于神的本性和我们自身的本性，违背它就是违背自己，履行它就是成全自己。这是第一点。

**神的律法的实质：**

另一个我想讨论的是神的律法的实质，这里我所指的是，在接下来的几个月中，我们会研读《申命记》，而《申命记》的中间部分实际上是对这十诫每条律法的详细解释。所以我不需要逐一解释这些命令的意思。我想让你们看到的是一些通常不被注意到的东西，也就是这些命令是如何密切联系在一起的。我希望你们能看到它们是完全相互依存的。当我刚成为基督徒时，有一节经文让我很困惑，那就是雅各书2:10。雅各书2:10说道，如果你试图遵守神的律法，但在某一点上违背了，就等于全都违背了。这个说法让我困扰，因为我觉得，如果在十条中遵守了九条，今天已经不错了，我们应该得到一些认可。90%可是个“A”等成绩。然而，我现在明白了，我对这节经文的理解完全错了。雅可是想说明的是，这些律法之间比我们想象中更紧密。

让我解释一下。首先我想展示十诫的三种结合方式。第一种结合是垂直和水平的结合，这可能你们已经听过了。律法的第一表，第一到第四诫，关于如何荣耀神，如何用心、灵、力、意爱神。接下来的诫命，即第五到第十诫，是水平的，如何爱邻如己。因此，这里有水平的，如何爱邻如己，以及垂直的，如何用心、灵、力、意爱神。所以它结合了水平和垂直。它不是仅仅属灵的，也不仅仅是社会的，而是两者都是。它不是仅仅个人和属灵的，也不仅仅是外在和社会的，而是两者兼备。这是第一种结合。

**内在与外在：**

第二种结合是内在和外在并重。它涵盖了内在的、心理的、属灵的、动机上的，也涵盖了外在的、实际的。现在，我希望你们思考一下。我们上周讨论过这个，我们将继续讨论，因为《申命记》中不断提到。第一和第二诫提到，不可在我面前有别的神，不可为自己雕刻偶像，不论是鸟、鱼、日、月、星等。这是在谈论你内心深处的东西。如果有任何东西比神的爱对你的希望、人生意义、自我价值和安全更重要，那就是罪。我们以前谈过这个，但让我再给你一个例子。我偶尔会用这例子，但它是我最喜欢的之一。很多年前，我们在弗吉尼亚的青少年团契中有一个女孩，你们中的一些人可能听我说过这个故事。我认为她当时15岁左右，她坐在那里说对生活感到沮丧。作为一个25岁的牧师，我给她讲道理，我说，你是基督徒吗？是的。我重生了，我有基督的义，有天父的爱，并且有新天新地的保证。然后她说，但如果男孩们甚至不知道我存在，那这些有什么意义呢？是不是很可爱？对吧，是的。

但她在做什么呢？她难道不相信福音吗？她难道不相信神和这些美好的事情吗？是的，但神在她心中只是音频，而男孩们是视频。如果你同时听音频和看电影，你的注意力会被什么吸引？当然是电影，而不是音频，对吧？是图像，而不是声音。她信仰神，但男孩抓住了她的想象力。想象力，图像。男孩们抓住了她的心。男孩们对她的自我比神更重要，这在15岁女孩中可能是常见的。我并不是挑她的毛病，但你看十诫触及到事情的核心。是什么激励着你？是什么抓住了你的想象力？你内心真正的动力是什么？你为什么起床？你的希望是什么？你人生的意义是什么？是否有什么比神的爱更重要？

这是诫命所追求的第一件事，所以它谈及内在。然后在第十诫中提供了一个标志。你怎么知道有什么比神更重要？缺乏满足感。是的，第十诫说，不可贪婪，但你知道这是什么意思吗？是对知足的要求。如果你比任何事情都更爱神，当你看到自己没有的东西时，你可能会说，我喜欢它们，但它们不会驱使你，不会让你不安。第十诫就是对内心平安的要求。

第十诫是一种对爱神的呼召，也是对满足于现状的呼召。每个人都渴望成功，渴望有关系，渴望被爱，渴望成就。但是如果神是你终极的安慰、关注和安全感，那么即使没有钱、没有关系也不会困扰你。若你经历了这样的内心转变，把神放在心灵的中心，那你就能安享安息日。为什么呢？因为如果你满足于现状，你就不会过度劳累，也不会通过性行为寻求自我满足和自我实现，而只会在婚姻中与另一人建立承诺和社区。你看，只有内心的转变才能让你做到诫命所要求的一切。因此，在某种意义上，十诫实际上在要求人重生，要求人内心的转变、内心的平和和满足，除此之外还有实际的行动。

你会发现这些诫命不仅结合了垂直的与水平的关系，也结合了内在与外在，最后还结合了个体与团体。在我们现在的文化中，价值观常常是分裂的。有一群人强调对穷人的关爱、公正和公平，包容每个人。但在个人道德上，比如性行为，各自做主。然后另外一群人强调传统价值观，比如宗教信仰、道德，不犯奸淫等，但在关注穷人上似乎并不那么重要。但如果你真正阅读十诫并理解其意义——我们接下来几个月会详细探讨——你会发现这里有个综合体。例如，诫命二是禁止虚假信仰；诫命四是尊敬父母，属于传统家庭价值观；禁止偷盗，正如我们接下来会看到的，意味着关心每个人的经济福利；不杀人意味着关心他人的身体安全和生活条件。所以由此形成了一个整体。

纵观安息日，如果你过度工作，那么你就是经济系统中的一个齿轮，任其剥削，即使是自愿的。因此，这里也涉及到文化、社会和宗教神学的分析，以及个人和社会道德的思考。所有这些都存在于其中。现在让我们回到雅各书第二章第十节，你会看到它的含义是什么？当他说，“若是遵守全律法，仅在一条上跌倒的，他就是犯了众条。”它们都是相互依存的。例如，有人说：“哦，我很好，我上教堂，读圣经，祷告，尊荣神。”但同时却虐待员工，尖酸刻薄，不友善，残酷对待他人，却自称爱神。等等，如果你说你在前几条诫命上表现良好，尊荣神，但却不爱人，那你其实并没有真正尊荣神。所有诫命都是一体的。如果你没有遵守命令五到十，那么你也没能真正履行命令一到四。

如果说谎、偷窃，虽然没有犯偶像崇拜罪，但其实当你谎言、盗窃或犯任何其他罪时，实际上是犯了偶像崇拜。除非你把它们看得比神还重要，否则你不会撒谎、偷窃。若神在你生命中是绝对第一位，你便不需要这样做，没有什么动力去做。你看，它们都是连成一体的。实际上，不能只遵守一个而不遵守其他。打破一个，就是打破全部。

**律法的问题：**

我们都追求成功、真爱或完美人生，这些美好的事物很容易成为终极目标。当我们信任它们时，内心深知它们无法满足我们最深切的渴望。事实上，我们把美好的事物视为小神，无法真正给予我们所需。提摩太·凯勒在《伪神：金钱、性与权力的空承诺，以及唯一重要的希望》一书中揭示了圣经如何阐明社会理想和我们内心的真实状况，并指出唯有一位神能够完全满足我们的渴求。本月，为感谢您的奉献以帮助Gospel & Life与全球分享基督之爱，我们将寄送《伪神》一书作为答谢。您可以在gospelandlife.com/give申请您的副本。现在，提摩太·凯勒博士将继续今天的教导。我们来看看十诫的实质和其相互依赖性。这不是我们通常谈论的话题，因为我们在教授时往往立刻把它们分解开来解释。不过，我要告诉你，它们全都是一体的。是不是很神奇？

但这引出了第三个要点，即律法的问题。若要理解律法的问题，请看看第24和25节。这是以色列百姓听到十诫后的首次反应。请注意他们怎么说：“耶和华我们的神已经将他的荣耀和威严显给我们，我们从火焰中听见他的声音，但现在为什么要死呢？这大火将吞灭我们，我们若再听耶和华我神的声音，我们就必死。” 注意他们在说什么。听到神从火中讲话是美好又可怕的事情。太不可思议了！何等荣耀！但他们不愿意继续下去。上周我们讨论过神的火焰，绝对圣洁和完美是一种美丽的危险。

理应如此生活。《废除人》的作者C.S.路易斯在书的附录中论证，十诫几乎是全世界宗教的共识。尽管各个宗教在神是谁、我们是谁、我们从哪儿来、我们如何得救这些问题上有着天壤之别，但当问到我们应如何生活时，几乎有着完全的共识。十诫基本上就是常识。《罗马书》第二章说它们被写在我们的心上，无论我们是谁。路易斯对此做了很有力的论证。所以当你听到神的律法时，一方面你会说，当然，我应该这样生活，我怎能不这样生活？但另一方面，你却又说，我无法做到。以色列的子民意识到，神的律法是他们无法活着没有，却也无法靠着生活的。他们既不能没有律法生活，也不能靠律法生活。这是每个文化都必须以不同方式应对的问题。然而，每个文化都有其演绎方式。让我给你一个简单的例子。当今社会存在所谓的文化战争。文化战争很大程度上与这个观念有关：是否存在一个所有人都必须遵守的神圣道德绝对律法？一方面，世俗人士说，不存在这样的绝对律法，道德是相对的，对个体和文化都是相对的。若你自认为掌握了它们，你就是世界的问题所在。另一方面，传统人士，通常是宗教信仰者，来自各种宗教，他们则说，当然存在这样的神圣律法。当然存在一组绝对道德律法。不相信它们的人是世界的问题所在。但这两种立场都有严重的问题，真的很严重。首先，对世俗者说，如果没有神，我们只是自然演化而来，那么你凭什么说善待他人是对的，残酷待人是错的？你如何能将你的看法强加给他人？而另一方面，宗教人士在迫害和利用所谓的“真理”伤害他人方面有着可怕的记录。对此，我在最近读到的一篇文章中看到了某种联系。这篇文章提到，以色列的一所大学在2003年对所有公社进行了研究。以色列有成百上千的公社，其中有些是宗教的，有些是世俗的。研究发现，宗教公社在经济上远超过世俗公社。深入研究得出，世俗人士，特别是男性，比宗教人士更加自私和注重个人主义，这也是公社表现不佳的一个原因。但你看到问题的核心了吗？世俗主义使人自私和个人主义，但宗教却使人部落化、分裂、自以为是。如果没有律法，一切都是相对的，我为何不可随心所欲地生活？但有了律法，觉得拥有真理，就会觉得可以攻击他人。世俗主义让人自我和自私，而宗教则往往让人部落化。

**解决方案——神未实现的渴望：**

我们该怎么办？我们不能靠神的律法生活，却也不能没有它。这正是以色列子民面临的问题。那么答案是什么？这在这段经文中最神奇的是第29节，在这节中神说：“但愿这些百姓有一颗敬畏我的心，遵守我一切的诫命，使他们得福。”在这里，神仿佛在表达情感。这位烈火的神也有情感。他愿他的子民出于爱而顺服他，而不仅仅因为害怕他。希伯来文中，“敬畏”一词并不意味着恐惧，而是敬畏某物的荣耀和恩典，比如被一段美妙音乐或艺术作品所吸引。神表达了他希望他的子民出于爱而顺从。不仅仅因为我是神，而是因为我是你的神。仔细审视这一段，很明显的是神一次又一次地说：“我是耶和华你的神。”这种亲近关系是神所渴望的。为什么他赐下律法？并不是为了让我们屈服。作为神，他只需打个响指就能让我们屈服。所以他赐下律法的目的是为了表明他愿意与我们建立爱的关系。

想要与您建立爱的关系。如果您顺从我，那是您对我的爱，也是我对您的爱，因为这满足了您最深的本性。哦，但愿我的子民不是因为我是神而顺从，而是因为我是他们的神而顺从。**耶稣——终极的律法履行者：**

有希望实现这个愿景吗？这是未实现的渴望。他知道这并没有发生。几个世纪后，一个人来到耶路撒冷，看着耶路撒冷，在《路加福音》19:41中开始哭泣，说：“耶路撒冷，耶路撒冷，但愿你能明白有关你平安的事，但现在它们隐藏在你的眼前。” 这个人就是耶稣。一个星期后，他上了十字架。为什么？为了付清我们违反律法的刑罚。为我们的罪付出代价，我们未能遵守律法的方式。好吧，您一直听过这些，对吗？但这是我不知道我们是否足够了解的东西，或者可能根本不了解的东西。当他被钉在十字架上时，他被遗弃了。心理学家会告诉你，最糟糕的事情就是被所爱的人遗弃。配偶的死亡或离婚是人类可以遇到的两件最糟糕的事情，但与此相比，那算不了什么。因为父与子从永恒就彼此认识和相爱，而在十字架上，耶稣被遗弃。他正在经历违反律法的刑罚。他在为我们该死的死而死。但当他走上十字架时，问题来了，为什么？他不必走上十字架。他告诉您原因，因为当他大声呼喊时，他没有说：“神啊，神啊，为什么离弃我？”他说：“我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？”这是盟约的语言。这是故意使用的盟约语言。那么，你知道那意味着什么吗？在十字架上，耶稣基督不仅仅是在死去应该由我们死去的死亡，而且是在活出我们应该活出的生命。耶稣基督正在履行律法。他正在做上帝希望我们做的事情。我的神啊，你意识到他在十字架上为我们的罪而死时是在做什么吗？他以一种没有人曾经做到过的方式，全心、全魂、全力和全意地爱着他的神。没有人被送下地狱还能依然爱神。你知道，亚哈说，从地狱的心脏，我刺向你。记得亚哈船长吗？从地狱的心脏，我刺向你。但那只是个比喻。耶稣基督是真正在地狱中，而他说，从地狱的心脏，我仍然爱你。我忠于你。没有人像这样全心、全魂、全力和全意地爱过他的主，也没有人像这样爱过他的邻舍，因为他是为你我下到地狱。他以一种没有人做到过的方式完全履行了律法，因此当哥林多后书5:21说，神使那无罪的替我们成为罪，好让我们在他里面成为神的义，意味着不仅我们的罪被加在他身上，他承受我们该得的，而他的义来到我们这里，他的顺服，律法的履行来到我们这里。现在神以对待他的方式对待我们，就好像我们做了他所做的一切。这意味着两件事。第一，我不必害怕顺从律法，因为我因耶稣基督所做的事被接纳。我不必害怕。我可以出于喜悦去遵守律法。我知道我会不完美，但我不会一直感到极端的内疚，因为即使是我对律法的不完美顺从，也是对那位为我做这一切的人的爱的开始。世俗主义使人以自我为中心和自私，而宗教使人部落化，但福音使你在自私和优越上变得谦卑，并转向外面去服务他人，走在那位为敌人而死的人的脚步中。**结论：**

我们的快乐和责任，虽然曾经对立，但当我们看到他的美丽时，就不再分离。看到基督履行的律法，听到他赦免的声音，将奴隶变成孩子，将责任变成选择。耶稣基督是终极的盟约守护者，因此我们这些盟约破坏者，他是终极的律法履行者，因此我们这些律法破坏者现在可以出于爱和感恩，怀着解脱和没有恐惧的心来遵守律法，只有喜悦，这样我们才能取悦、模仿并享受那位为我们做这一切的人。让我们祷告。我们的父，上帝的律法是极其广泛和极其强大的，如果没有耶稣是不可能遵守的，但有了耶稣，当我们看到他履行律法时，现在我们想要遵守律法，并且我们不怕尝试。我们想要遵守它，并且我们不害怕尝试和失败，因为我们会。它完全改变了我们对律法的整个态度，我们祈求你帮助我们牢记这些事情，以便我们不会回到那些不理解福音的人的问题中，要么是抛弃律法，造成巨大的破坏，要么是尝试遵守，带来极大的内疚、骄傲和焦虑。父啊，除非我们理解耶稣基督在十字架上用全心、全魂、全力和全意爱了你，并以无与伦比的方式爱了我们邻居，替代我们，代替我们，为我们而做，不然我们永远无法克服律法的问题，现在我们知道凡在基督耶稣里的人就不被定罪。帮助我们接受这一切。让它感动我们。让它改变我们。我们奉耶稣基督的名祈祷，阿门。感谢您收听Tim Keller在生命中的福音播客。如果您希望看到更多人因这个事工以福音为中心的教导和资源而得到鼓励，我们邀请您考虑成为“生命中的福音”的月度合作伙伴。您的月度合作帮助我们全年规划和管理我们的资源，以最有效的方式将基督爱的生命力传递给世界各地的人们。作为对您每月支持的小小感谢，我们将会邮寄给您每期新的《生命中的福音》季刊的实体副本，您可以享受并分享给他人。要了解更多信息，请访问gospelinlife.com/partner。那个网站再次是gospelinlife.com/partner。今天的讲道录制于2007年。您在“生命中的福音”播客中听到的每个讲道和演讲都录制于1989年至2017年，期间Dr. Keller担任Redeemer长老会的资深牧师。
