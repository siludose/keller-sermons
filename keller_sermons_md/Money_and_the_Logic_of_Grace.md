### Introduction: The Importance of Money in the Bible

Why does the Bible talk about money so much? How we think about and use our money is one of the most common subjects throughout Scripture. And the Bible tells us something striking. **You cannot experience deep spiritual growth without putting your money and your attitude toward it in God's hands.** Listen as Tim Keller shows us why generosity is not optional for Christians, but a vital mark of authentic faith.

> "Our Scripture reading tonight is from the Book of Luke chapter 14 verses 7-24."

### Part One: The Astonishing Standard of Sacrificial Giving

#### 1. The Parable of the Wedding Feast

When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, he told them this parable. When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited. If so, the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, give this man your seat. Then humiliated, you will have to take the least important place. But when you are invited, take the lowest place so that when your host comes, he will say to you, friend, move up to a better place. Then you will be honored in the presence of all your fellow guests. **For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.**

#### 2. The Patronage System

When Jesus said to his host, when you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers or relatives, or your rich neighbors. If you do, they may invite you back, and so you will be repaid. But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the cripple, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.

### Part Two: The Logic of the Gospel Makes Sacrificial Giving Reasonable

#### 1. The Gospel's Inner Wealth

In verses 7 through 11, Jesus sees how the guests are picking places of honor at the table. He says, when someone invites you to a feast, don't take the higher, the more honored seats, let somebody there will ask you to move, and then you're humiliated. Take the lower seats so somebody asks you, oh come on up here closer to me.

#### 2. The Resurrection's Future Wealth

He tells the host, don't invite these people, invite the poor, the cripple, the lame in the blind, and you'll be blessed, and then he says, although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.

#### 3. The Sacrifice of Jesus Christ

Look at this great banquet story. Jesus is speaking to a smug guest at the banquet who hears him talking to the host and says in verse 15, he says, blessed is the man who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God.

### Conclusion: The Call to Generosity

Let's wrestle with this together as a community. Some of you are guests, probably, you don't even, I'm not obviously after your money because you don't even live here. Some of you, in fact, and here's the other thing I want you to know, we'll talk about this next week. I'm not here to say, you now because of this sermon, here's your application, give money to Redeemer. First, a lot of you don't go to Redeemer, you're not members of Redeemer. I don't want you to think about that for a second. I want you to think, I'm asking, here's another minister asking me for money. I want you to say, what should my attitude toward my money be in light of the gospel? And that's a frightening, frightening question to ask because as John Newton said, I really don't know how to quite get my hands, my head around what Jesus is saying here, but I just know this, I need to be giving a lot more than I am now, and I think that's right.

Let's pray.

Our Father, help us to be conformed to the image of your Son, though he was rich, he became poor, though he was an insider, he was cast out. And when we see that, that has got to affect the way in which we think about our funds and about our money and about our lifestyle and about how we spend it, I pray, Lord, that you would enable us to, as a community, be famous for a generosity to each other and to the city. And I pray that you would more and more conform this into the image of your Son who came not to be served, but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many. It's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

### 引言：圣经中金钱的重要性

为什么圣经如此频繁地谈论金钱？我们如何思考和使用金钱是圣经中最常见的主题之一。圣经告诉我们一个惊人的事实：**如果不把金钱和对金钱的态度交给上帝，你就无法体验深刻的属灵成长。** 听听 Tim Keller 如何向我们展示，慷慨对基督徒来说不是可选的，而是真信仰的重要标志。

> “今晚的经文来自路加福音第十四章第七至二十四节。”

### 第一部分：惊人的牺牲性给予标准

#### 1. 婚宴的比喻

当他注意到客人们如何选择桌上的尊贵位置时，他给他们讲了这个比喻。当有人邀请你参加婚宴时，不要坐在尊贵的位置上，因为可能有比你更尊贵的人被邀请。如果是这样，邀请你们两人的主人会来对你说，把这个人的座位让给他。然后你会感到羞愧，只能坐在最不重要的位置上。但当你被邀请时，坐在最低的位置上，这样当你的主人来时，他会对你说，朋友，上来坐在更好的位置上。**因为凡自高的，必降为卑；自卑的，必升为高。**

#### 2. 赞助系统

当耶稣对他的主人说，你设午宴或晚宴时，不要邀请你的朋友、兄弟或亲戚，或你的富邻居。如果你这样做，他们可能会回请你，这样你就得到了回报。但当你设宴时，要邀请贫穷的、残疾的、瘸腿的、盲眼的，你就会有福。虽然他们不能回报你，但在义人的复活时，你会得到回报。

### 第二部分：福音的逻辑使牺牲性给予合理

#### 1. 福音的内在财富

在第七至十一节，耶稣看到客人们如何选择桌上的尊贵位置。他说，当有人邀请你参加宴会时，不要坐在更高、更尊贵的座位上，以免有人让你移动，然后你会感到羞愧。坐在较低的座位上，以便有人邀请你，上来坐得更近。

#### 2. 复活的未来财富

他告诉主人，不要邀请这些人，而是邀请贫穷的、残疾的、瘸腿的、盲眼的，你就会有福，然后他说，虽然他们不能回报你，但在义人的复活时，你会得到回报。

#### 3. 耶稣基督的牺牲

看看这个伟大的宴会故事。耶稣对宴会上的一个自满的客人说，他听到耶稣对主人说话，并在第十五节说，他说，在神的国里吃饭的人有福了。

### 结论：慷慨的呼召

让我们作为一个社区一起思考这个问题。你们中有些人可能是客人，我显然不是在追求你们的钱，因为你们甚至不住在这里。事实上，这里还有另一件事我想让你们知道，我们下周会谈到这个。我不是在这里说，因为这篇讲道，这就是你的应用，给 Redeemer 捐钱。首先，你们中很多人不去 Redeemer，你们不是 Redeemer 的成员。我不想让你们考虑这个。我想让你们思考，我在问，另一个牧师在向我索要钱。我想让你们说，我对金钱的态度应该是什么，在福音的光照下？这是一个令人恐惧的问题，因为正如 John Newton 所说，我真的不知道如何完全理解耶稣在这里所说的，但我知道，我现在需要比现在给予更多，我认为这是对的。

让我们祷告。

我们的父，帮助我们被塑造成你儿子的形象，虽然他富有，却变得贫穷，虽然他是内部人士，却被抛弃。当我们看到这一点时，这必须影响我们对资金、金钱、生活方式以及如何使用它的思考方式。我祈求主，你能使我们作为一个社区，以对彼此和城市的慷慨而闻名。我祈求你越来越多地将我们塑造成你的儿子的形象，他来不是要受服侍，而是要服侍，并为多人舍命作为赎价。奉耶稣的名祷告。阿门。
