### Introduction: The Difference Between Outward Self-Control and Inner Transformation

The Bible tells us there's a difference between outward self-control and the deep lasting change only the Holy Spirit can bring. In Galatians 5 Paul calls these inner transformations the fruit of the Spirit. Love, joy, peace, patience, and more. Join us today as Tim Keller explores one of the fruit of the Spirit. The Scripture this morning is from Paul's letter to the Philippians chapter 4 verses 4 through 12.

> "Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again. Rejoice. Let the gentleness of your be evident to all. The Lord is near, do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving present your requests to God. And the peace of God which transcends all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."

**The premise of the Bible is that there is a difference between a morally restrained heart and a supernaturally changed heart.**

### The Character of Peace

The opposite of joy is sadness or despair, grief. But the opposite of peace is anxiety, fear, and debilitating worry. So you see here in verse 6, it says, don't be anxious about anything, and the antidote is the peace of God.

> "The peace of God will guard your hearts and your minds."

**Christian peace is not expelling negative thoughts.**

### The Disciplines of Peace: Thinking, Thanking, and Loving

#### 1. Thinking

Paul says, "Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable. If anything is excellent or praiseworthy, think about such things."

- Think about doctrine.
- Think about what you know about life and God.

#### 2. Thanking

Paul says, "Make your requests to God with thanksgiving."

- Thank Him as you make the request.
- Acknowledge that life is in His hands.

#### 3. Loving

Paul says, "Whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable, whatever is excellent."

- Love the right things.
- Love of the immutable can bring tranquility.

### The Secret of Peace

Paul talks about the secret of peace. **The peace of God keeps your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.**

- Jesus lost all of His peace so you could have eternal peace.
- Looking at that is what will make Him lovely.

> "Horatio Spafford wrote a hymn dealing with his grief, seeking the peace of God."

Let's pray.

Thank you, Father, for giving us this offer, peace, like a river, peace infallible. We see, Lord, that peace is not something that really does just come; it's not a talent and it's really not even just a simple gift. It's a discipline. We have a number of beliefs that we're not thinking into. We have a wonderful God that we're not loving and therefore we don't have the peace we ought to have. Give us this peace because we know the secret how we can be thankful for even the bad things in our lives. It's the cross. How we can know that God is with us no matter what it's the cross and we pray that you would help us knowing the gospel of Jesus Christ. Think and thank and love you into the peace of God. It's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

### 引言：外在自制与内在转变的区别

圣经告诉我们，外在的自制与只有圣灵才能带来的深刻持久的改变之间是有区别的。在加拉太书5章中，保罗称这些内在的转变为圣灵的果子。爱、喜乐、平安、忍耐等等。今天，蒂姆·凯勒将探讨圣灵的果子之一。今天的经文来自保罗写给腓立比人的信，第四章第4到12节。

> "你们要靠主常常喜乐。我再说，你们要喜乐。要让众人看出你们的谦和。主已经近了。应当一无挂虑，只要凡事借着祷告、祈求和感谢，将你们所要的告诉神。神所赐出人意外的平安，必在基督耶稣里保守你们的心怀意念。"

**圣经的前提是，道德上被约束的心与超自然改变的心之间是有区别的。**

### 平安的特质

喜乐的反面是悲伤或绝望、悲痛。但平安的反面是焦虑、恐惧和令人衰弱的担忧。所以你在第6节看到，它说，不要为任何事焦虑，解药是神的平安。

> "神所赐的平安必保守你们的心怀意念。"

**基督徒的平安不是排除负面思想。**

### 平安的操练：思考、感恩与爱

#### 1. 思考

保罗说，"凡是真实的、可敬的、公义的、纯洁的、可爱的、有美名的，若有什么德行，若有什么称赞，这些事你们都要思念。"

- 思考教义。
- 思考你对生命和神的认识。

#### 2. 感恩

保罗说，"以感谢的心向神祈求。"

- 在祈求时感谢祂。
- 承认生命在祂的掌握中。

#### 3. 爱

保罗说，"凡是可爱的、可称赞的、卓越的。"

- 爱正确的事物。
- 对不变者的爱可以带来宁静。

### 平安的奥秘

保罗谈到平安的奥秘。**神的平安保守你们的心怀意念在基督耶稣里。**

- 耶稣失去了祂所有的平安，以便你可以拥有永恒的平安。
- 看着这一点会让祂变得可爱。

> "霍雷肖·斯帕福德写了一首赞美诗，处理他的悲伤，寻求神的平安。"

让我们祷告。

感谢天父，赐给我们这份平安的邀请，像河流般的平安，无法动摇的平安。我们看到，主啊，平安不是简单地到来的；它不是一种天赋，甚至也不是一种简单的礼物。它是一种操练。我们有许多信仰没有深入思考。我们有一位奇妙的神，我们没有去爱，因此我们没有我们应有的平安。赐给我们这平安，因为我们知道这个奥秘，如何在我们生活中的坏事中也能感恩。这就是十字架。我们如何知道无论如何神与我们同在，这就是十字架。我们祈求您帮助我们，认识耶稣基督的福音。思考、感恩和爱您进入神的平安。奉耶稣的名祷告。阿门。
