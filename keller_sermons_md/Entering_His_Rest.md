Welcome to Gospel in Life. Do you ever wish life came with an owner's manual, a guide to follow when you're facing difficult decisions or just trying to live with integrity in the small everyday moments? Today on Gospel in Life, Tim Keller shows us how the Ten Commandments help us align our lives with God's will, not by restricting us with outdated rules, but by laying the foundation from which we can live a life of true freedom and flourishing.

**Hebrews 4:1-12:**

Therefore since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it, for we also have had the gospel preached to us, just as they did. But the message they heard was of no value to them, because those who heard did not combine it with faith. Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said, so I declared on oath in my anger, they shall never enter my rest. And yet his work has been finished since the creation of the world. For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words, and on the seventh day God rested from all his work.

We're in a series of sermons on the Ten Commandments, and today we're talking about the commandment that says, honor the Sabbath day, the day of rest. One of the most important themes in the Bible is the theme of rest.

Psalm chapter 3 is one of my favorite chapters. In the psalm it says, "O Lord, how many are my foes, how many there are that rise up against me, but thou, O Lord, art a shield for me. My glory and the lifter of my head. Therefore I lie down and I sleep, and I awake for you sustain me. I will not fear, though tens of thousands would encamp against me."

That's an amazing passage. Here is a man who goes to sleep the night before a battle knowing full well that he's greatly outnumbered, and he sleeps. And he rests.

The great question in life is, do you know how to lie down and sleep? Because anybody can lie down, but can you sleep? Can you rest? I would propose to you that this is the real way for you to tell the validity of your faith.

What is the Sabbath rest? It's the REM of the soul. You know what REM is? Rapid eye movement. Scientists will tell you that the thing that restores the body is not the length of your sleep, it's the depth. It's not how long you're sleeping, but whether you get into those periods of deep sleep.

**The Trial - Kafka's Message:**

Franz Kafka wrote a novel called The Trial. It's about a man named Joseph K. who wakes up one morning on his 30th birthday and discovers that he has been arrested. He's under house arrest and waiting trial. And they will not tell him what he's arrested for.

Joseph K. falls back on two clichés that many of us use: The world is a rational place, and I am basically a decent person. But these don't work. He begins to look his life over and remembers dishonesties, betrayals, ways that he cut corners. Eventually, he feels more and more anxiety, guilt, and condemnation.

The great minds of the 20th century drive home the same thing: the world is not a rational place, people are not all that decent, and if you look carefully, you'll see that you're not all that decent either.

**Romans 2 - The Invisible Tape Recorder:**

Romans chapter 2 says: "You have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else. For whatsoever point you judge another, you are judging yourself because you do the same thing."

Imagine God put an invisible tape recorder around your neck the day of your birth. It only clicks on whenever you tell somebody else how they ought to be. On judgment day, God will say, "I'm going to be very fair. I'm not going to judge you by the Word of God. All I'm going to do is judge you by your own standards."

Nobody will pass that test.

**How to Enter the Rest:**

To enter the rest of God means you have to hear the gospel. Two parts:

1. **Rest from hiding your sin.** There is no peace and rest for the soul unless first there's conviction of sin. The only way for the trial to be over is for you to say, "I'm guilty," instead of going around saying, "I know there's an explanation somewhere."

2. **Rest from your works.** Jesus Christ came to live in your place. He came to do everything necessary that you should do. The principle is this: Only Jesus Christ can be a Christian. Only God could really be human. The moment you receive him by faith, you have received the righteousness of Christ instead of working at your own righteousness.

**The Test of Rest:**

When somebody accuses you of something and you're a Christian with rest, you can sit there and listen. If they're right, you say, "You're right." Because deep down you say, "Yes, there's a lot of bad things like that in my life. But God knows it and He accepts me completely, so I don't have to defend myself." That's rest.

"Lay your deadly doing down, down at Jesus' feet. Stand in Him, in Him alone, gloriously complete."

### 中文翻译

欢迎来到《福音生活》。你是否曾希望人生有一本使用手册？今天在《福音生活》中，蒂姆·凯勒向我们展示十诫如何帮助我们使生活与神的旨意一致——不是用过时的规则来限制我们，而是奠定基础，让我们可以过上真正自由和繁荣的生活。

**希伯来书 4:1-12：**

既然进入他安息的应许仍然存在，我们就当畏惧，免得你们中间有人似乎是赶不上了。因为有福音传给我们，像传给他们一样；只是所听见的道于他们无益，因为他们没有用信心与所听见的道调和。但我们已经相信的人得以进入那安息，正如神所说："我在怒中起誓说，他们断不可进入我的安息。"其实造物之工从创世以来已经成全了，因为论到第七日，他在某处说："到第七日，神就歇了他一切的工。"

我们正在进行十诫的系列讲道，今天我们要谈的是"守安息日为圣日"这条诫命。圣经中最重要的主题之一就是安息的主题。

诗篇第3篇是我最喜欢的章节之一。诗篇中说："耶和华啊，我的敌人何其加增，有许多人起来攻击我。但你耶和华是我四围的盾牌，是我的荣耀，又是叫我抬起头来的。我躺下睡觉，我醒着，耶和华都保佑我。虽有成万的百姓来周围攻击我，我也不怕。"

这是一段令人惊叹的经文。这里有一个人，在战斗前一晚入睡，明知自己寡不敌众，但他依然入睡。他安息了。

**人生的大问题：**

人生的大问题是：你知道如何躺下安睡吗？因为任何人都可以躺下，但你能睡着吗？你能安息吗？我想向你们提出，这才是检验你信仰真实性的真正方法。

安息日的安息是什么？它是灵魂的深层睡眠。你知道什么是快速眼动睡眠吗？科学家会告诉你，恢复身体的不是睡眠的长度，而是深度。不是你睡多久，而是你是否进入那些深度睡眠期。

**卡夫卡的《审判》：**

弗朗茨·卡夫卡写了一本小说叫《审判》。它讲述了一个名叫约瑟夫·K的人，在他30岁生日那天早上醒来，发现自己被逮捕了。他被软禁，等待审判。但他们不告诉他因何被捕。

约瑟夫·K依赖两个我们许多人使用的陈词滥调：世界是一个理性的地方，我基本上是一个正派的人。但这些不管用。他开始回顾自己的生活，记起不诚实、背叛、偷工减料。最终，他越来越感到焦虑、内疚和定罪。

20世纪伟大的思想家们反复强调同一件事：世界不是一个理性的地方，人们没有那么正派，如果你仔细看，你会发现你自己也没有那么正派。

**罗马书第2章——隐形录音机：**

罗马书第2章说："你这论断人的，无论你是谁，也无可推诿。你在什么事上论断人，就在什么事上定自己的罪，因你这论断人的，自己所行却和别人一样。"

想象神在你出生那天在你脖子上挂了一个隐形录音机。它只在你告诉别人应该怎么做时才会开启。在审判日，神会说："我会非常公平。我不会用神的话语来审判你。我只会用你自己的标准来审判你。"

没有人能通过那个测试。

**如何进入安息：**

进入神的安息意味着你必须听到福音。两个部分：

1. **停止隐藏你的罪。** 除非先有对罪的认识，否则灵魂就没有平安和安息。审判结束的唯一方法是你说："我有罪"，而不是到处说："我知道某处有解释。"

2. **停止依靠你的行为。** 耶稣基督来是为了代替你而活。他来做你应该做的一切必要的事。原则是这样的：只有耶稣基督能成为真正的基督徒。只有神才能真正成为人。当你凭信心接受他的那一刻，你就接受了基督的义，而不是努力建立自己的义。

**安息的测试：**

当有人指责你某事，而你是一个有安息的基督徒，你可以坐在那里倾听。如果他们是对的，你就说："你说得对。"因为在内心深处你说："是的，我生命中有很多这样的坏事。但神知道，他完全接受我，所以我不需要为自己辩护。"这就是安息。

"放下你致命的努力，放在耶稣脚前。单单站在他里面，荣耀地完全。"
