### Introduction: Who is the Holy Spirit?

Who is the Holy Spirit? And why is the Spirit's work so vital to the Christian life? The Bible tells us the Holy Spirit is not just a vague force, but a person who works in the lives of Christians in profound ways. Today Tim Keller is exploring how the Spirit calls us to faith, unites us together, equips us with gifts and shapes us to be more like Christ.

The Scripture reading this morning comes from John's Gospel, chapter 14, verses 16-26.

> And I will ask the Father and He will give you another counselor to be with you forever, the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept Him because it neither sees Him nor knows Him, but you know Him for He lives with you and will be in you. I will not leave you as orphans, I will come to you. Before long the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me because I live, you also will live. On that day you will realize that I am in my Father and you are in me and I am in you. Whoever has my commands and obeys them, He is the one who loves me. He who loves me will be loved by my Father and I too will love Him and show myself to Him. Then Judas, not Judas Iscariot, said, but Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world? Jesus replied, If anyone loves me, He will obey my teaching. My Father will love Him and we will come to Him and make our home with Him. He who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own, they belong to the Father who sent me. All this I have spoken while still with you, but the counselor, the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.

This is the Word of the Lord.

### The Personhood of the Holy Spirit

First, who is He? Who is the Holy Spirit and by the way, I already gave you a bit of an answer by the choice of my pronoun. **The Holy Spirit is a personal, is the personal divine resident of the Christian's heart.**

- The Holy Spirit is personal. Jesus refers to the Holy Spirit, not as it, as we tend to do, not as an energy or as a force, but as He.
- The Holy Spirit is God. Jesus says, He's another counselor, I'm a counselor, He's another one.

### The Work of the Holy Spirit

The Holy Spirit is a Spirit of Truth and a counselor.

- **Spirit of Truth:** The Holy Spirit authored the Bible. The words of Jesus that you see in the Bible were produced by the Spirit.
- **Counselor:** The Holy Spirit is your legal advocate. The Holy Spirit's job is to defend you against the enemies here on earth, but especially the enemies inside your own heart.

### Receiving the Holy Spirit

How can you be sure that you're receiving the benefits that the Holy Spirit can offer you?

- **Understanding the First Advocate:** Jesus Christ is our advocate in heaven. The Holy Spirit is our advocate on earth.
- **The Holy Spirit's Role:** The Holy Spirit's job is to pull. He's an advocate on earth pointing to our advocate in heaven, making the work of the advocate in heaven so beautiful to your life that it changes it.

Let's pray.

Our Father, we thank You for the gift of the Holy Spirit. We thank You for sending another counselor into our lives. Oh, how we do. Thank You for that. And we pray that You would help us to be filled with the Spirit. We pray that You would help us to receive His counseling. We pray that You would help us to cooperate with Him as He advocates for us. And we ask that You would help us to do this as an entire church so we truly would be a Spirit-filled church. The world will do this and You'll be grateful. You'll be glad for us. You'll be, we'll be grateful to You and You'll be glorified in us. And that's what we want. We pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.

### 引言：圣灵是谁？

圣灵是谁？为什么圣灵的工作对基督徒的生活如此重要？圣经告诉我们，圣灵不仅仅是一个模糊的力量，而是一个在基督徒生活中以深刻方式工作的位格。今天，Tim Keller 探讨圣灵如何呼召我们信仰，将我们联合在一起，装备我们以恩赐，并塑造我们更像基督。

今天早上的经文来自约翰福音第十四章第16-26节。

> 我要求父，父就另外赐给你们一位保惠师，叫他永远与你们同在，就是真理的圣灵。世人不能接受他，因为不见他，也不认识他；你们却认识他，因为他常与你们同在，也要在你们里面。我不撇下你们为孤儿，我必到你们这里来。还有不多的时候，世人不再看见我，你们却看见我，因为我活着，你们也要活着。到那日，你们就知道我在父里面，你们在我里面，我也在你们里面。有了我的命令又遵守的，这人就是爱我的；爱我的必蒙我父爱他，我也要爱他，并且要向他显现。犹大（不是加略人犹大）问耶稣说，主啊，为什么要向我们显现，不向世人显现呢？耶稣回答说，人若爱我，就必遵守我的道；我父也必爱他，并且我们要到他那里去，与他同住。不爱我的人就不遵守我的道；你们所听见的道不是我的，乃是差我来之父的道。我还与你们同住的时候，已将这些话对你们说了。但保惠师，就是父因我的名所要差来的圣灵，他要将一切的事指教你们，并且要叫你们想起我对你们所说的一切话。

这是主的话。

### 圣灵的位格

首先，他是谁？圣灵是谁？顺便说一下，我已经通过选择我的代词给了你一点答案。**圣灵是基督徒心中的个人神圣居民。**

- 圣灵是个人。耶稣称圣灵为他，而不是我们倾向于称之为的它，不是能量或力量，而是他。
- 圣灵是神。耶稣说，他是另一位保惠师，我是保惠师，他是另一位。

### 圣灵的工作

圣灵是真理的灵和保惠师。

- **真理的灵：** 圣灵是圣经的作者。你在圣经中看到的耶稣的话是由圣灵产生的。
- **保惠师：** 圣灵是你的法律辩护者。圣灵的工作是保护你免受地上的敌人，尤其是你自己内心的敌人。

### 接受圣灵

你如何确保你正在接受圣灵可以提供的好处？

- **理解第一位保惠师：** 耶稣基督是我们在天上的辩护者。圣灵是我们在地上的辩护者。
- **圣灵的角色：** 圣灵的工作是拉动。他是地上的辩护者，指向我们在天上的辩护者，使天上辩护者的工作在你的生活中如此美丽，以至于改变了它。

让我们祷告。

我们的父，我们感谢你赐予圣灵的礼物。我们感谢你将另一位保惠师送入我们的生活。哦，我们多么感谢你。我们祈求你帮助我们被圣灵充满。我们祈求你帮助我们接受他的辅导。我们祈求你帮助我们配合他为我们辩护。我们请求你帮助我们作为整个教会这样做，以便我们真正成为一个被圣灵充满的教会。世界将这样做，你会为我们感到高兴。我们会感激你，你会在我们中得到荣耀。这就是我们想要的。我们奉耶稣的名祷告。阿门。
