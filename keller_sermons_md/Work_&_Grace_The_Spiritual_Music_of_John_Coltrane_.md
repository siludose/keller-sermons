### Introduction: Work and Biblical Wisdom

If you have a job, it's likely that you think about it a lot. But how much have you thought about the Biblical approach to your work? Today, on Gospel and Life, Tim Keller shows us that the Bible has incredibly helpful and practical wisdom we can apply to the work we do. Wisdom you may find surprising, even life-changing.

### Coltrane's Quotes on Music and God

I want to talk about two quotes, two things that John Coltrane said about the relationship between God and His music. And I think each of them tells us something very significant. The first one tells us something about the relationship of music and art to God. And the second one talks about our relationship of our work in general to God.

### Music as Evangelism

Another way to put it is this. Coltrane's first quote points to music as evangelism. The second quote points to music as service. Now, when I use the word evangelism, I hope for a moment you can sort of shake free your mind from any association that word with politics, fundamentalism, and remember that evangelism means good news of hope.

Here's the first quote. John Coltrane says overall, I think the main thing a musician would like to do is give a picture to the listener of the many wonderful things that he knows and senses in the universe. That's what I would like to do. I think that's one of the greatest things you can do in life, and we all try to do it in some way. The musician is through his music.

> "Music can tell the most hopeless heart that there's hope, the most meaningless heart that there's meaning."

**Music has a way of coming to you and saying in spite of how you feel, there is hope, there is meaning.**

### Music as Service

Coltrane actually points to music as service, and this actually applies, not just to musicians and artists, but to us all. He says, in the liner notes of a love supreme, he says, during the year 1957, I experienced by the grace of God a spiritual awakening which was to lead me to a richer, fuller, more productive life.

> "At that time, in gratitude, I humbly asked to be given the means and privilege to make others happy through music, to inspire them to realize more and more of their capacities for living meaningful lives."

### Coltrane's Spiritual Journey

Stephen J. Gold was right when he said, if you think life is meaningless, what am I who you are? You've got to create a meaning for yourself. And one of the ways most of us, especially in a place like New York, one of the ways most of us find a way to make sure where you know we're significant is through our work.

### Balancing Art and Worship

If you use your work as a desperate search, a desperate effort to give yourself meaning in life, ironically you won't do a very good job with your work, but culture and something happened to change culture and changed all that for him.

### The Role of Discipline

Now, you know, you got a musician, you got a minister. I have no idea what in the world kind of questions you're going to ask. But we always do it and we think some of you will ask questions.

### Finding Meaning in Work

It's estimated that most of us spend half of our waking hours at work. How does the wisdom of the Bible apply to our careers? In other words, how can our work connect with God's work and how can our vocations be more emotional?

### Audience Q&A

Hi, and you earlier talk, you mentioned that one of the things that defines us is our work. And certainly I feel like it's taken a lot of my time. Maybe it's because I'm not really a musician. I feel that sometimes my work takes me away from my spiritual side. So maybe you could give a guidance of sharing experience. How when times it's a you feel not disconnected with yourself. How you come back to present. How do you come back to your spiritual side?

### Conclusion

Listen, this guy is so well spoken. And a lot of you hear me a lot. But boy, this has been terrific to have John here tonight. So let's give my hand for being here. Thank you. Thanks for coming.

### 引言：工作与圣经智慧

如果你有一份工作，你可能会经常想到它。但你有多少次思考过圣经对工作的看法呢？今天，在《福音与生活》中，提姆·凯勒向我们展示了圣经中一些非常有帮助且实用的智慧，我们可以将其应用于我们的工作中。这些智慧可能会让你感到惊讶，甚至改变生活。

### 柯川关于音乐与上帝的引言

我想谈谈约翰·柯川关于上帝与他的音乐关系的两句话。我认为每一句都告诉我们一些非常重要的事情。第一句告诉我们音乐和艺术与上帝的关系。第二句则谈到我们工作与上帝的关系。

### 音乐作为福音传播

换句话说，柯川的第一句话指出音乐作为福音传播。第二句话指出音乐作为服务。当我使用“福音传播”这个词时，我希望你能暂时摆脱这个词与政治、原教旨主义的任何关联，记住福音传播意味着希望的好消息。

这是第一句。约翰·柯川说，总的来说，我认为音乐家最想做的事情是向听众展示他在宇宙中知道和感受到的许多美好事物的画面。这就是我想做的事情。我认为这是你在生活中能做的最伟大的事情之一，我们都在以某种方式尝试做到这一点。音乐家通过他的音乐。

> “音乐可以告诉最绝望的心灵有希望，告诉最无意义的心灵有意义。”

**音乐有一种方式来到你面前，告诉你尽管你感觉如何，仍然有希望，有意义。**

### 音乐作为服务

柯川实际上指出音乐作为服务，这不仅适用于音乐家和艺术家，也适用于我们所有人。他在《至高无上的爱》的唱片封套中说，1957年，我经历了上帝的恩典，一次灵性觉醒，这将引导我过上更丰富、更充实、更有成效的生活。

> “那时，出于感激，我谦卑地请求被赋予通过音乐使他人快乐的手段和特权，激励他们更多地实现他们生活的意义。”

### 柯川的灵性旅程

斯蒂芬·J·戈尔德说得对，如果你认为生活是无意义的，那我是谁？你必须为自己创造意义。在像纽约这样的地方，我们大多数人找到确保我们有意义的方法之一就是通过我们的工作。

### 平衡艺术与崇拜

如果你将工作用作绝望的搜索，绝望的努力来给自己生活中的意义，讽刺的是你不会在工作中做得很好，但文化和一些事情发生了变化，改变了柯川的一切。

### 纪律的作用

现在，你知道，你有一个音乐家，你有一个牧师。我不知道你会问什么样的问题。但我们总是这样做，我们认为你们中的一些人会问问题。

### 在工作中寻找意义

据估计，我们大多数人将一半的清醒时间花在工作上。圣经的智慧如何应用于我们的职业？换句话说，我们的工作如何与上帝的工作相连，我们的职业如何变得更加情感化？

### 观众问答

嗨，你在早些时候的谈话中提到，我们的工作是定义我们的一件事。当然，我觉得它占用了我很多时间。也许是因为我不是真正的音乐家。我觉得有时我的工作让我远离我的灵性一面。所以也许你可以分享一些经验，当你感到与自己脱节时，你如何回到现在。你如何回到你的灵性一面？

### 结论

听着，这个人说得很好。你们很多人经常听到我说话。但天哪，今晚有约翰在这里真是太棒了。所以让我们为他的到来鼓掌。谢谢。谢谢你们的到来。
