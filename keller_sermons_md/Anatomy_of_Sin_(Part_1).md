### Introduction: The Problem of Sin

You don't have to look far to see that something's deeply wrong with our world and with us. But is there an answer that gets to the root of why? In today's message, Tim Keller explores the human condition through stories in the Bible, uncovering what Scripture says about sin and why it's the only explanation deep enough to face the truth about ourselves.

The teaching this morning is based on this passage in Jeremiah. I'm going to read chapter 2, and what's printed there, verses 2 to 13 and verse 19. Jeremiah is one of the last prophets that God sent to the people of Judah before their nation and culture collapsed completely. They were invaded, they were carried away into exile, and the book of Jeremiah is a series of sermons from God in a sense to the people through the prophet Jeremiah.

> "I remember the devotion of your youth, how as a bride you loved me and followed me through the desert through a land not sewn. Israel was holy to the Lord, the first fruits of his harvest, all who devoured her were held guilty and disaster overtook them, declares the Lord."

**This is God's Word.**

### Sin as Denial

There are three things that we learn from this passage about the nature of sin, the definition you might say, the characteristics, the character of sin, and here is what they are. First of all, we learn from this passage and from the Lord, therefore, that sin is by essence denial, sin is denial.

> "Consider then and realize how evil and bitter it is for you."

**Sin is denial that we're sinners.**

### The Essence of Sin

Sin is not just denial in general. What is sin denial of? We said sin is a denial, but in particular, pardon me, God here tells us what the essence of sin is, what the nub of it is, what the heart of sin is.

> "Consider and realize how bitter, evil and bitter it is when you forsake me, but then he tells and he tells why they forsake and have no awe of me."

**This is the essence of sin.**

### Application: The Centrality of God

Do you understand? First of all, let me apply it in a couple different ways. There's a number of ways. First of all, do you see, therefore, that there is no way, no way, that there can be halfway measures when it comes to God.

> "If you are a little religious, if you are a little moral, if you are kind of religious, in other words, you can't have a God at times, you can't have a God as a vitamin supplement."

**Sin is irrational.**

### Conclusion: The Solution

This is the solution to all your problems personally. This is the solution to our society's problems. This is the solution. God says, this is what's wrong with you. It's not the economy's due, but it's sin and it's the best news I can give you.

**Let's pray.**

Father, we thank you that it's now possible for us to know what's really been available to be known for thousands of years, but people continually turn away from it. They continually deny it. We realize, Father, that we have to cut through our own force field of denial to see your greatness and your reality. We pray, Father, that you would show us your love and your grace so that we will trust ourselves to put you first. We ask, Father, that you would show us how we can solve our individual problems by seeking your fear and seeking your awe and seeing your awesomeness. Apply these truths to our lives through your Holy Spirit. We ask it in Jesus name. Amen.

### 引言：罪的问题

你不需要费力去寻找，就能看到我们的世界和我们自身有些深刻的问题。但是否有一个答案能深入探究其根源呢？在今天的信息中，Tim Keller 通过圣经中的故事探讨了人类的状况，揭示了圣经对罪的看法，以及为什么它是唯一足够深刻的解释，能够面对关于我们自己的真相。

今天早上的教导基于耶利米书中的这段经文。我将阅读第二章，其中印刷的内容是第2到13节和第19节。耶利米是上帝在犹大民族和文化完全崩溃之前，派给他们的最后一位先知之一。他们被入侵，被带到流放地，而耶利米书实际上是一系列来自上帝的讲道，通过先知耶利米传达给人民。

> “我记得你年轻时的忠诚，如同新娘爱我，跟随我穿过未耕种的荒野。以色列是耶和华的圣物，是他收获的初熟果子，凡吞吃她的必算为有罪，灾祸必临到他们，这是耶和华说的。”

**这是上帝的话。**

### 罪即否认

从这段经文中，我们学到了关于罪的本质的三件事，你可以说是定义、特征、罪的特性，而这就是它们。首先，我们从这段经文和主那里学到，罪本质上是否认，罪就是否认。

> “因此要思想并意识到这对你是多么邪恶和痛苦。”

**罪是对我们是罪人的否认。**

### 罪的本质

罪不仅仅是一般的否认。罪否认的是什么？我们说罪是一种否认，但特别是，上帝在这里告诉我们罪的本质是什么，它的核心是什么，罪的心是什么。

> “思想并意识到，当你离弃我时，这是多么邪恶和痛苦，但他告诉他们为什么他们离弃我，因为他们对我没有敬畏。”

**这就是罪的本质。**

### 应用：神的中心性

你明白吗？首先，让我以几种不同的方式应用它。有很多种方式。首先，你是否看到，因此，在对待上帝时，没有任何半途而废的办法。

> “如果你有一点宗教信仰，如果你有一点道德，如果你有点宗教信仰，换句话说，你不能有时有一个上帝，你不能把上帝当作维生素补充剂。”

**罪是不理性的。**

### 结论：解决方案

这是解决你个人所有问题的方案。这是解决我们社会问题的方案。这是解决方案。上帝说，这就是你的问题所在。这不是经济的问题，而是罪的问题，这是我能给你的最好消息。

**让我们祷告。**

父啊，我们感谢你，现在我们可以知道那些数千年来一直可以被知道的东西，但人们不断地转离它。他们不断地否认它。我们意识到，父啊，我们必须突破我们自己否认的力场，才能看到你的伟大和真实。我们祈求，父啊，你会向我们展示你的爱和恩典，以便我们信任自己，把你放在首位。我们请求，父啊，你会向我们展示如何通过寻求你的敬畏和敬畏，看到你的伟大，来解决我们个人的问题。通过你的圣灵将这些真理应用到我们的生活中。我们奉耶稣的名求。阿门。
