Welcome to Gospel in Life. You don't have to look far to see that something's deeply wrong with our world and with us. But is there an answer that gets to the root of why? In today's message, Tim Keller explores the human condition through stories in the Bible,  uncovering what Scripture says about sin and why it's the only explanation deep enough  to face the truth about ourselves.

The teaching this morning is based on this passage in Jeremiah. I'm going to read chapter 2, and what's printed there, verses 2 to 13 and verse 19. Jeremiah is one of the last prophets that God sent to the people of Judah before their  nation and culture collapsed completely. They were invaded, they were carried away into exile, and the book of Jeremiah is a series  of sermons from God in a sense to the people through the prophet Jeremiah.

And this is the first of all the great sermons in which Jeremiah is trying to show the people  of Judah what's wrong with them, why their lives are falling apart, why their culture  is falling apart, why their psyches are falling apart, why their families are falling apart. Let me read, beginning here at the top, verse 2, I remember the devotion of your youth,  how as a bride you loved me and followed me through the desert through a land not sewn. Israel was holy to the Lord, the first fruits of his harvest, all who devoured her were  held guilty and disaster over took them, declares the Lord. Hear the word of the Lord, oh house of Jacob, all you clans of the house of Israel.

This is what the Lord says. What fault did your fathers find in me that they strayed so far from me? They followed worthless idols and became worthless themselves. They did not ask, where is the Lord who brought us up out of Egypt and led us through the  barren wilderness through a land of deserts and rifts, a land of drawed and darkness, a land  where no one travels and no one lives.

I brought you into a fertile land to eat its fruit and rich produce, but you came into  filed my land and made my inheritance detestable. The priest did not ask, where is the Lord? Those who deal with the law did not know me, the leaders rebelled against me, the prophets  prophesied by bail following worthless idols. Therefore, I bring charges against you again, declares the Lord, and I will bring charges  against your children's children.

Cross over to the coast of Kittemann, look, send a catar and observe closely, see, if there  has ever been anything like this, has a nation ever changed its gods yet they are not gods  at all, but my people have exchanged their glory for worthless idols. Be appalled at this, O heavens, and shudder with great horror declares the Lord, my people  have committed two sins, they have forsaken me, the springs of living water, and have dug  their own sisters, broken sisters that cannot hold water. Your wickedness will punish you, your backsliding will repute you, consider then and realize  how evil and bitter it is for you when you forsake the Lord, your God, and have no  awe of me, declares the Lord, the Lord Almighty. This is God's Word.

Starting today, stretching on for about three months, all the way up to Easter, Easter is  about three months away, we are going to be doing a series of teachings on the subject  of sin, what it is, how it operates, what its effects are, what kinds, what types there  are, and we start this week and you will see us again next week with this first sermon  by Jeremiah to the people of Israel, because they were saying to themselves, and they were  saying they were calling out and saying, what is wrong with us, why are things falling  apart, what is wrong, you know, that is interesting that it seems like after every election  nowadays, everybody has been thrown out, new people have been brought in, and the papers  are saying, why is everybody so unhappy, what is wrong with us, and actually everybody  is saying, what is wrong, what is going on, well the people of Israel were asking that  question, and God came through and said, let me tell you what is wrong with you, and he  gives them a sermon on sin, the nature of sin, the character, the characteristics of sin,  and as we look at this, it is interesting, I feel like it is a huge sermon, it is last  37 verses, but it is really summarized in verse 19, sort of the summarization of its  in verse 19, there is several summarizations, but I am going to look at that mainly. There is three things that we learn from this passage about the nature of sin, the definition  you might say, the characteristics, the character of sin, and here is what they are, first of  all we learn from this passage and from the Lord, therefore, that sin is by essence denial,  sin is denial, look, look at the language he uses, consider then and realize how evil  and bitter it is for you, see that, consider then and realize how evil and bitter it is for  you, you know what this language is, this is intervention language, you know you have  a friend who calls you up, let's say, the wife of a friend calls you up and she says you  know for years he has been covering something up, there is a self, there is destructive  behavior in his life, he has been covering it up, he has been hiding it, but it has come  out, but he still won't see it, please come over here, tell him what he is doing, so you  go on over and you sit down and you hear the story, and how do you start to talk, what  do you say, what's your language, you say can't you see, don't you see what you are doing  to yourself, it's clear everybody else can say it, you are killing yourself, how can you  do this, you don't get it, you have to get it, you have to see, that's how you talk, that's  the language of intervention for a deluded loved one, don't you see, this is the language  that God uses on us, he assumes by this language, consider then and realize, what's that  mean, consider, you are not thinking, realize, you don't get it, you don't see what your  problem is, you don't realize what the source of the evil and bitterness of your life is, you  don't see it, you don't get it, you have to see it, this is the language of intervention,  the language of pleading, in other words, what we learn from this verse, what we learn  from this passage, what we learn from the Bible, the root of our problems is the force field  of denial that sin always entails, let me put it a couple of different ways, it is not fatal  to be a sinner, it's not being a sinner that's fatal according to the Bible, it's the  denial that you're a sinner that's fatal, I mean let's look at the at the most obvious,  it's just, you know, it's crying out and I've already in a sense alluded to the most obvious  parallel here, it's not, it's not fatal to be an alcoholic, is it plenty of alcoholics  are leading productive lives, what is fatal, it's a fatal to be an alcoholic and to deny  that you are, that's fatal, and we also know that there's something about the evil of alcoholism  which is what it is, it's an evil, there's something about the very nature of it that puts  out a force field of denial, isn't that right? Well that in a sense, that's just a metaphor,  in many ways a very small metaphor, just a dim reflection of what God is talking about  here, God is saying if there's evil and bitterness in your life and if there's not evil and  bitterness in your life, you're just very young, in other words if you have evil and bitterness  and you just wait, you know, wait, right, you know, I saw the Adam's family values last  night and, you know, there's little preppy girls looking at Wednesday and saying, why are  you dressed as if there's a funeral, why are you dressed as if someone's died and she  looks at you as just wait, well, the same idea, God says your life is evil and bitter, you  say my life isn't evil and bitter, God says just wait, when you see the evil and the bitterness  of your life, God says the root problem of our society and of humanity is that we  will not admit that we're sinners, there's nothing fatal about being sinners, God says there's  lots you can do about that, what's fatal is to deny that you are, that's why it is evil and  bitterness, because you don't consider, because you don't realize, consider that and realize,  that's the thing you've got to do, that's the thing you've got to see, if I could, if I could,  there's a force field that comes out from sin, you know, the old radio shows based on the shadow  that a character that had learned over in the east to cloud the minds of people around him so  they couldn't see him and it became a movie that nobody went to see this last summer as well,  that's the, but the whole idea is the shadow is someone who clouds people's minds, that's what  sin is, sin is the shadow, the real shadow, by its nature sin entails denial and you will not see  the extent and the magnitude, oh yes, we, of course, I'm a human being, I air, I'm flawed,  that's not to admit you're a sinner, that's not to admit you're a helpless sinner,  that there's, as, as Dorothy Sayers says, there's a radical interior dislocation in the heart  that we're way off-center, because we center on ourselves, that we're capable of tremendous evil,  I wish, if I could do it, I would make everybody read the poets and the philosophers and the great  thinkers of the end of the 19th century, both sides of the Atlantic, you know, in Europe and here,  what they said, they were getting rid of Christianity, they were getting rid of religion,  they were getting rid of what they considered superstition, and they said, oh yes, we are finally  bringing in a rational approach to government, a rational approach to poverty, a rational approach to  human beings, we've gotten rid of superstition, and we are going to see incredible things happen,  we're going to see an end, you ought to read the stuff, you're going to see an end  to poverty in the 20th century, we're going to see the end of war in the 20th century, the end  of war, they almost all said this, and now where are we? What was their problem, denial?

They, look, I mean, here are two great two terrific examples, I mean, there's just  zillions of examples, you know, the HG Wells and WHO, and I love to quote them,  you know, I hate to see the pain, but you see, years of, you know, they start off with this idea,  we're not sinners, and by the end of their lives, after years of disillusionment, and years of  brokenness, why? Because of the denial that we are sinners, filing the end there, brought  kicking and screaming to the place where the Bible could have pointed to start with, years wasted  over it. There's a lady, two people who were at the very foundation of the reconstruction  of the British Social Welfare Society, Sydney and Beatrice Webb, two great people did a lot of  good, but they got rid of Christianity in their own lives. In 1890, Beatrice Webb put in her diary,  this word, she said, I've staked everything on the essential goodness of human nature.  35 years later, in her diary, she reminded herself of what she had said in 1890, she cited that,  where she said, I've staked everything on the essential goodness of human nature, but then she said,  I realize now how permanent are the evil impulses and instincts in us, that mayor's social machinery  will never change.

She had staked her whole life on the idea that social machinery will get rid  of the poverty, will get rid of the violence, will get rid of these things because we're essentially  good at the end of her life. The one thing she decided would be the solution. She came to realize,  I now see, I now know, how permanent are the evil instincts and impulses in us. She'd given her  whole life to something.

The Bible could have told her to start with, she was in denial. More recent, her guy named Ernest Becker, won the Pulitzer Prize, he was a social scientist. He wrote two books on evil. The first book on evil was the structure, he called the structure  of evil.

In that book, he says the real problem in the world, the reason we have poverty and the  reason we have war, the reason we have violence is because the privileged are oppressing everybody  else through oppressive social structures, and therefore he says its social science applied  to government will deal with evil. Right after he died, his last book was published called Escape  from Evil, and in the preface, you know what he says? He had changed completely, he says, I am now in  this book looking at humanity full in the face for the first time. He says in my previous works, I had failed  to see how truly vicious human behavior is, and then get this quote, this is a dilemma that I have  been caught in along with many others who have been trying to keep alive the enlightenment tradition.

This enormous problem to see that humanity is so evil causing now requires some third alternative  beyond bureaucratic science or despair. Do you know what he's saying? This is my whole life I figured  that bureaucratic science, which simply means social sciences apply better schools, legislation,  better regulations, better work on people, you see social science applied to bureaucracy,  that would deal with evil. Now that I see for the first time after years of facing my whole life,  I now see there's gotta be some third way because bureaucratic science won't work and we can't  just despair, what is that third way?

Consider then and realize how evil and bitter it is  when you forsake the Lord your God. In other words, what the Bible says is, what's wrong? What's wrong? Why spend your whole life in denial and at the end be pulled kicking and screaming  to the place you'll never see thinkers ever start out saying people are scumbags by the end of  their life they're saying now I realize that people are wonderful.

Never happens, never. It's always  the other way around. At the end of their lives they're saying I've based my whole, how could people be  so wicked, how could people be so evil? They've been in denial.

What was the problem? What was the problem? It's not the economy stupid. It's sin.

It's sin. We gotta move on. The first point is this. Sin by its nature entails denial of itself.

Sin puts out a force field. Sin is denial that we're sinners. I'll just quickly do you believe it? Do you apply it to yourself?

Sometimes I think I'll make these  points and I gotta show you the application for example just a couple ways. For example, surely  there's some of you many many people say, I believe in the law of God in general. I think the  tank amendments are great. I really do.

Most of the time. But we can take these two things too far. If you were honest all the time in New York, you'd never make any money at all. If you were sexually pure all the time, you'd never have any fun.

The moral law is pretty good  up to a time, up to a place, but you can overdo these things. Consider and realize  you are in denial as to how powerful sin is. You cannot cut corners of the law of God. To do that  shows that you have no idea the power that's within you.

You have no idea about how pernicious  and how pathological you have no idea of how deadly sin is. When you say, I can play around with  it. This is a gray area. I don't know if it's right or wrong.

It doesn't seem wrong. Who knows? What  the heck? Consider and realize.

We all tend to deny. We all tend to underestimate. Let me give you  another example. Some of you are saying and occasionally find you but most of you I don't for the  very reason.

Many of you are saying, here's an area of my life in which I've got a problem. I  know it. There's a flaw. There's a character flaw.

I keep falling into it. I keep getting into it. Maybe I should tell somebody, no, no. I'll do it myself.

I'd be too embarrassed. I wouldn't  want to tell anybody else. I wouldn't want to go to anyone for counsel. I wouldn't want to share  this with a good friend and say, please hold me accountable.

No, no, no, that'd be too embarrassing. I can do it myself. Consider. Then and realize.

You're in denial. We're always in denial. We  always underestimate the power of the sin. Always do.

You always think I can handle it. One more, just one more example. There's an awful lot of folks, I think, who  are in a position where they are getting from somebody right now, criticism. It's very easy  to write it off 100% because the criticism is truly exaggerated or you can see that the  motives of the person are bad.

Or you can see that there's a lot of error mixed in it. It's not  exaggerated, but much of what they're saying is wrong with you really isn't wrong. So maybe you look at it and you say it's mainly wrong or it's exaggerated or you can, you know,  you consider the source. You know who that person is and what a mess that person is,  or you know what kind of motive that person is.

But remember this. You ought to say to yourself,  if you take this seriously that sin is denial by its essence in its nature, you ought to say  continually, you know, it may be exaggerated, it may be mixed with error, it may be from a  fairly unadmirable source. But is God trying to tell me something? Because I know by my nature,  I tend to deny the things that really are wrong with me.

If you believe what I'm telling you here,  you should be the most gracious when it comes to criticism. The most open when it comes to  criticism when you get it. You should be the most willing to listen to people who have something  to tell you that's wrong with you. You should be the least defensive person.

If you take this seriously,  do you? Everywhere we look we see brokenness, wars, cruelty and heartache. We feel it in the world  around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way and what can be done about it?

In his  brand new book that's releasing this month, what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a  clear and compassionate answer. Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer, Dr. Keller  shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us and how only the gospel  offers lasting freedom and healing.

Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world,  struggling with your own mistakes or choices or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with  the world will help you see how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain  within each of us. This newly released book, What Is Wrong with the World, is our thanks for your gift  this month to help gospel in life share the good news of Jesus.

Now here's Dr. Keller with the rest of  today's teaching. Sin is denial, but secondly and mainly sin is not just denial in general. What is sin denial of?

We said sin is a denial, but in particular, pardon me, God here  tells us what the essence of sin is, what the nub of it is, what the heart of sin is. What is it? Well he says consider and realize how bitter, evil and bitter it is when you forsake me,  but then he tells and he tells why they forsake and have no awe of me. Now this is the essence.

This is the essence of sin. If you ask somebody what you know defines sin for me and they'll say  well sins are breaking the rules, sins are breaking God's laws, if you believe in God,  sins, that's what sins are. That's right, that's what sins are, but sin is a disposition,  it's an attitude, it's a stance, it's a posture of the heart and Paul, and here I keep saying Paul,  that's because I'm remembering other times. God in this passage says the heart of why you forsake  him, the heart of why you sin, the reason you break the rules, the essence of it all, no awe.

You have no awe of me. Let me show you why this is the whole thing, this is the heart of it all. The new international version that we're reading, this translation, the NIV translation,  says you have no awe of me, but the word that's here is the word that's used throughout the Bible,  and it's been most translations, it says you have no fear of me. Now one of the central themes of  the Bible is the fear of the Lord, and all through the Bible there's all this talk about the fear of  the Lord, and that's what God is saying, is the essence of sin.

You do not have the fear of the Lord,  well what does fear mean? Now here's the problem, in the Bible the word fear is used in two different  ways, and we in our modern common use of the word only use it in one of those two ways. So first of all the Bible says there's a fear, in first John 4 it says there's a fear that  hath torment. Now what does that mean?

Well it's pretty simple. When we use the word fear we mean it  in this way. Fear is the anticipation of pain. Fear is the anticipation of pain, but look how  fear works.

Fear means you suddenly get fixed on what's going to happen to you, and when you're  paralyzed by fear you might say when you're in the grip of fear you are focusing on what is coming  and everything is done in reference to it. See if you're afraid, in other words for example  I'm not afraid of at least I'm not creeped out by insects, so if I see a spider or I see  in New York a roach or something like that wandering around I'll say oh there it is, I don't like it. Somebody else might find, maybe it's irrational, they cannot sit and read a book in a room  with a little roach running around. Why?

They can't because they're afraid of it, okay? They're  creeped out by it, it appalls them, it obsesses them which means they cannot do anything without  reference to it, they can't forget it, it dominates everything they do, they can't get up and just  you know have a cup of coffee, they can't read, they can't, they must deal with that roach. Why? That's what fear does.

Fear absorbs you, it obsesses you with an object so that you cannot do  anything except with reference to it, but then the Bible talks about a different kind of fear  in Proverbs 28, 14, it says happy as the one who fears always, what? Happy as the one who fears  always. We read Jeff used it for our words of encouragement, it says in Psalm 130 verse 4  because you've forgiven my sins, I fear you, what? And here's what's so interesting,  there is when it comes to God something the Bible calls fear, it's a positive fear, not a negative  fear, but you see why?

You say, well why use the term? It's an inward awe before God, it's an inward  condition of delight in the magnitude of who he is. You say, well why call that fear? You see what  they have in common?

Positive fear does not have torment. In negative fear you're totally absorbed  in yourself. In positive fear you're blessedly free from thinking about yourself. In negative fear  you're parallels, in positive fear you're empowered, but here's what they have in common.

The fear of the Lord means he is absolutely central. You can do nothing without reference to him. No matter what you do, you say, how does this involve God? How does this affect my relationship  with God?

How does this relate to God? Because you see the magnitude of who he is  and the greatness of who he is, and he is now utterly and absolutely central. There is nothing that you can possibly do or think without reference to his glory, his greatness,  his love, his power. You see that?

Now God says that's the essence of sin, that's the essence of  everything. In other words God is so wise, God is getting beneath the violations. You say,  well, you say sins are violating the law. When you lie, when you are selfish, when you're cruel,  when you do these things, that's sin.

Well, God says, but why would you ever do it? Why would you ever  disobey? Why would you ever be cruel? Why would you ever lie?

Why? And the answer is whenever you  sin in a particular way, at that point, you are holding something in more awe than you are holding  God in, something you find more wonderful than God, something more dynamic than God,  something more captivating than God, something more awesome than God. You see? And that,  at that point, is the reason why you sin.

Let me apply this as we start to close up here. Let me  apply this. Do you understand? First of all, let me apply it in a couple different ways.

There's a  number of ways. First of all, do you see, therefore, that there is no way, no way, that there can be  halfway measures when it comes to God. God says, the essence of sin is to not have me smack  center in the middle of your life, smack center in the middle of your thoughts. If you are a little  religious, if you are a little moral, if you are kind of religious, in other words, you can't have  a God at times, you can't have a God as a vitamin supplement.

Years ago, a lady was teaching,  I've never forgotten what she said. A lady was teaching at a Christian conference and she said,  if the distance from the earth to the sun, that 93 million miles was just the thickness of one  sheet of paper. Do you know that the distance from the earth to the nearest star  would be a stack of paper 70 feet high? Do you know that just the diameter of our galaxy  would be a stack of paper 310 miles high?

Do you realize there's trillions and trillions and trillions  of galaxies that we know of? And do you know that if there is a creator God, that creator God holds it  all together with the word of his power? Now, she said, if he's there at all, how can you possibly  ask a person like that, a God like that into your life at times to come what he's called as an  assistant, as a way of getting you over the hump? Don't you see why sin is denial?

Sin is denial in  its essence because it's to be out of touch with reality. If there's a God at all, how can you relate  to him in any other way than with, unless you relate to him with complete and utter and unconditional  devotion? That's the reason why Paul says in Romans, I finally got one for Paul. Paul says in Romans 12  verse 1, in the Old King James, it's rendered this way, make yourself living sacrifices to God,  which is your reasonable service.

Sin is irrational. Either there's a God, but if there is a God,  we'll get to this and say, if there is a God, he must be central. He must be someone from whom you  can do nothing without reference. You have to do everything with reference to him, everything.

There's never an area of your life where you can say, well, you know, you don't even think about  what would God say about that. What does God say about that? Never. Do you understand that?

Oh, your problem, the reason your life is so evil and bitter, there's no awe. Let me give you another  application, intellectually, intellectually. You know, when the Bible says that a lack of centrality  of God is not only the cause of all of our personal problems, but it's the cause of all our  intellectual problems. In a place like Manhattan, I ought to say something about this.

So many of your  students, scholars, thinkers, counselors, God says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,  is the beginning of wisdom, unless God is obsessively in the center of your intellectual scheme. If here's what's so interesting about this verse, don't you see how evil and bitter it is for you  when you forsake me? If you don't have awe before God, it's not just that you're trampling on his  glory, you're trampling on your glory. If you don't understand God, you won't understand yourself.

Stephen Gould teaches at Harvard, doesn't believe in God. As a result, he says, what everybody  has to say, who doesn't believe in God. He says, why are we here? We are here because one odd  group of fish had a peculiar anatomy that could transform into legs.

We may yearn for a higher  answer, but there is none. We cannot read meaning in life into the facts of nature. Now, here's  what he's saying. Take out God.

There's no awe of God, then there's no awe before yourself. If God has no glory, you have no glory. You're a meaningless animal. There's no higher answer to that.

And you know what you're left with? You're left with a senseless life. You know why? Because you're  left with an incredible discrepancy between how you feel and how you operate and what you must be.

You must be a meaningless animal. When you're in love with somebody, you sit down and you never say  as you're kissing him or kissing her. You never say, this is just neurochemistry. There's no such  thing as love.

I'm just an animal. This is the way my brain is working. But that's the case. Unless  there's a God.

If you have no awe of God, it is evil and bitter for you. If there's no awe of God  in your thinking, there can be no wonder or awe before the idea of love. Love is nothing. It's just  neurochemistry.

As soon as you think of the idea of good and bad, do you believe there's some things  that are really wrong? Have you seen things? Have you heard of things? Have you read of things that  you say that's really wrong?

Not if there's no God. That's just a social construction. That's nothing but culture. No.

Don't you see? Nothing matters. There is nothing awesome. There  is nothing wonderful unless God is wonderful.

The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. If you have no awe of me, you will have no awe of anything. You won't have any awe of yourself. The doctrine of sin, they say, is pessimistic.

You're kidding me? If you don't have the doctrine of sin,  there's despair, there's nothing else. Don't you consider and realize how evil and bitter it is  for you when you forsake me and have no awe of me? All your personal problems come because God  is not central in your life.

All of our intellectual problems come because God is not central in our thinking. And here, lastly, dear friends, Christian friends, I want you to think about this. All of your self-control problems are coming because God is not central. You say, how could that be?

Well, it's pretty simple. Are you having trouble with worry? Are you having trouble with self-pity? Are you having trouble with guilt?

Whatever you're having trouble with, just see it in these terms. When you worry, you are in more in awe of the power of some factor than you are in the power of God. When you're guilty, you're more in awe of the power of your sin than you are in the magnitude of  his grace, the power of his grace. When you're in self-pity, you're more in awe of some great  benefit which you've lost than you are in his mercies.

When you are sure that everything's going  wrong in your life, you're more in awe of your own wisdom than you are of his wisdom at the moment. And therefore, do you know what you need? That's the reason why the psalmist says,  the fear of the Lord is clean. There's nothing that cleans you out like this.

When you sit down,  you don't just study your Bible just to get a little knowledge. When you come to church,  I hope you're not just coming to get wisdom. You need to see God. The fear of the Lord, awe,  you need to actually say, oh Holy Spirit, open my eyes so I see the awesomeness  because your worries are gone when you see him as more awesome than any factor in your life.

Your guilt is gone when you see his grace is more awesome than any sin in your life. Your self-pity  is gone when you see his mercies is more awesome than any missing factor in your life. Your anger is gone when you see God's wisdom is more awesome than any of your wisdom and any  of your little agendas for your life. You need more than anything else to see him.

Say,  oh Holy Spirit, magnify him. Let his glory be known. You need to wrestle until you see him,  until you feel it's possible. The Bible says you can have access to him.

You need that. Whatever your problem is tonight, today, whatever your problem is this week,  whatever your problem is, it can be cleaned with the fear of the Lord. No matter how defiled your  ark can be cleaned. If you go to him and you say it has been evil and bitter for me,  I've denied you and I've denied your centrality.

Do you know what he'll say? He'll say,  of course I'll have you. Of course I'll have you. And if you don't do that,  if you come out of this saying, well, I'm so wicked and I'm so evil and I'm so bad,  that why would God have me?

Here's the one thing that you're not in awe enough about,  his grace. Up in verse 6, and over and over and over again throughout the whole passage,  he says, nobody says where is the Lord who brought us up out of Egypt? You know what he's saying? He's saying, think about me.

You know why you don't obey me? You know why you don't make me central. You don't trust my love. You don't trust my grace.

He says, remember the Exodus. Think about it for a minute. Remember the fact I didn't give you the law in Egypt and then said, now if you obey that,  I'll bring you out. I brought you out first and then I gave you the law later.

I'm a God of grace. So why in the world are you afraid to make me central? I know why he says,  you feel like you'll lose your freedom. You'll lose your joy.

You see, you won't be free. You won't  have your options. If I obey and make God central, I will be limited in some way. God says,  why don't you say where is that gracious God who brought us up?

Where is that gracious God  who operates by grace? And that's the reason why here I say to you, unless you are ultimately  in awe of his grace, not just in awe, you can't say, I should stop sinning or God will get me. You should say, I should stop sinning because here's the gracious God who brought me out,  who brought me up. So if you go to him and say, my life is evil and bitter because I've been living  and denial at him a sinner and I've been living, especially in denial of your centrality and greatness.

What will God say? I am the one who brought you up. I am a gracious God. Of course, I'll take you back.

I sent my son to live your life and to die your death. That's how I bring people  up out of Egypt now. That's how I bring people out without the law, but strictly through grace. That's why I bring you up and put your sins away because Christ fulfilled the law.

Consider and realize it is evil and bitter for you if you are not in awe of my grace and mercy. So, this is the solution to all your problems personally. This is the solution to our society's  problems. This is the solution.

God says, this is what's wrong with you. It's not the economy's  due, but it's sin and it's the best news I can give you. Let's pray. Father, we thank you that it's  now possible for us to know what's really been available to be known for thousands of years,  but people continually turn away from it.

They continually deny it. We realize, Father,  that we have to cut through our own force field of denial to see your greatness and your reality. We pray, Father, that you would show us your love and your grace so that we will trust ourselves  to put you first. We ask, Father, that you would show us how we can solve our individual  problems by seeking your fear and seeking your awe and seeing your awesomeness.

Apply these  truths to our lives through your Holy Spirit. We ask it in Jesus name. Amen. Thanks for joining us here on the Gospel Unliked Podcast.

欢迎来到福音生活。你不需要走得太远就能看到我们的世界和我们自身存在着深刻的问题。但是否有一个答案能够深入探究其根源呢？在今天的信息中，Tim Keller通过圣经中的故事探讨了人类的状况，揭示了圣经对罪的看法，以及为什么它是唯一足够深入的解释，能够面对关于我们自身的真相。今天早上的教导基于耶利米书的这段经文。我将阅读第二章，印在那里的经文是2到13节和19节。耶利米是上帝在犹大民族和文化完全崩溃之前派给他们的最后一位先知之一。他们被入侵，被掳到流亡地，而耶利米书是上帝通过先知耶利米对人民的一系列讲道。在所有伟大的讲道中，这是第一个，耶利米试图向犹大人民展示他们的问题所在，为什么他们的生活崩溃，为什么他们的文化崩溃，为什么他们的心理崩溃，为什么他们的家庭崩溃。让我从这里开始读，第二节，我记得你年轻时的忠诚，像新娘一样爱我，跟随我穿过未播种的沙漠。以色列是耶和华的圣物，是他收获的初熟果子，凡吞吃她的必算为有罪，灾难必临到他们，这是耶和华说的。雅各家啊，所有以色列家的各族啊，要听耶和华的话。这是耶和华说的。你们的祖宗在我身上找到了什么过错，以致他们远离我？他们随从虚无的偶像，自己也变得虚无。他们没有问，带我们从埃及上来的耶和华在哪里？带领我们穿过荒凉的旷野，穿过沙漠和裂谷之地，干旱和黑暗之地，无人经过，无人居住之地。我带你们进入肥沃之地，吃其果实和丰富的出产，但你们进入后玷污了我的地，使我的产业成为可憎的。祭司没有问，耶和华在哪里？那些处理律法的人不认识我，领袖背叛了我，先知借巴力说预言，随从无用的偶像。因此，我再次控告你们，这是耶和华说的，我也要控告你们的子孙。过到基提海岸，看看，派人到基达，仔细观察，看看是否曾有这样的事，哪一国曾更换过他们的神，虽然那些不是神，但我的百姓却将他们的荣耀换成无用的偶像。诸天哪，要因此惊骇，要大大地战栗，这是耶和华说的。我的百姓犯了两件恶事，就是离弃我这活水的泉源，为自己凿出池子，是破裂不能存水的池子。你的罪孽必惩罚你，你的背道必责备你。你要知道并看明，离弃耶和华你的神，不敬畏我，是何等的恶事和苦事，这是主万军之耶和华说的。这是上帝的话。从今天开始，持续大约三个月，一直到复活节，复活节大约还有三个月，我们将进行一系列关于罪的教导，罪是什么，它如何运作，它的影响是什么，有哪些种类，哪些类型，我们从这周开始，你会在下周再次看到我们，这次是耶利米对以色列人民的第一次讲道，因为他们在问自己，他们在呼喊说，我们怎么了，为什么事情崩溃了，怎么了，你知道，这很有趣，似乎现在每次选举之后，每个人都被抛弃了，新人被带进来，报纸在说，为什么每个人都这么不开心，我们怎么了，实际上每个人都在说，怎么了，发生了什么，嗯，以色列人民在问这个问题，上帝来了，说让我告诉你们你们的问题是什么，他给了他们一个关于罪的讲道，罪的本质，罪的特征，罪的特性，当我们看这个时，我觉得这是一个巨大的讲道，它持续了37节，但实际上在第19节中总结了它的内容，有几个总结，但我主要看这个。有三件事我们从这段经文中学到关于罪的本质，你可能会说定义，特征，罪的特性，这就是它们，首先我们从这段经文和主那里学到，罪本质上是否认，罪是否认，看，看他用的语言，考虑然后意识到这对你是多么邪恶和痛苦，看到吗，考虑然后意识到这对你是多么邪恶和痛苦，你知道这是什么语言，这是干预语言，你知道你有一个朋友打电话给你，比如说，一个朋友的妻子打电话给你，她说你知道多年来他一直在掩盖一些东西，他的生活中有一种自我毁灭的行为，他一直在掩盖它，他一直在隐藏它，但它已经暴露出来了，但他仍然看不到，请过来这里，告诉他他在做什么，所以你过去坐下来听故事，你怎么开始说话，你说什么，你的语言是什么，你说你看不到吗，你看不到你在对自己做什么吗，很明显其他人都能看到，你在自杀，你怎么能这样做，你不明白，你必须明白，你必须看到，这就是你说话的方式，这就是对一个被迷惑的爱人的干预语言，你看不到吗，这就是上帝对我们使用的语言，他通过这种语言假设，考虑然后意识到，这是什么意思，考虑，你没有思考，意识到，你不明白，你看不到你的问题是什么，你没有意识到你生活中的邪恶和痛苦的根源是什么，你看不到，你不明白，你必须看到，这是干预的语言，恳求的语言，换句话说，我们从这节经文中学到的，我们从这段经文中学到的，我们从圣经中学到的，我们的问题的根源是罪总是伴随着的否认力场，让我用几种不同的方式来表达，根据圣经，成为一个罪人并不是致命的，成为一个罪人并不是致命的，致命的是你否认自己是一个罪人，我的意思是让我们看看最明显的，我已经在某种意义上提到了最明显的平行，这不是，成为一个酒鬼并不是致命的，是吗，很多酒鬼过着富有成效的生活，什么是致命的，成为一个酒鬼并否认你是，这就是致命的，我们也知道酗酒的邪恶是什么，它是邪恶的，它的本质有一种否认力场，不是吗？好吧，从某种意义上说，这只是一个隐喻，在许多方面是一个非常小的隐喻，只是上帝在这里谈论的一个模糊的反映，上帝说如果你的生活中有邪恶和痛苦，如果你的生活中没有邪恶和痛苦，你只是非常年轻，换句话说，如果你有邪恶和痛苦，你只需要等待，你知道，等待，对吧，你知道，我昨晚看了亚当斯家族的价值观，你知道，有个小预科女孩看着星期三说，为什么你穿得好像有葬礼，为什么你穿得好像有人死了，她看着你只是等待，好吧，同样的想法，上帝说你的生活是邪恶和痛苦的，你说我的生活不是邪恶和痛苦的，上帝说只要等待，当你看到你生活中的邪恶和痛苦时，上帝说我们社会和人类的根本问题是我们不会承认我们是罪人，成为罪人没有什么致命的，上帝说有很多你可以做的，致命的是否认你是，这就是为什么它是邪恶和痛苦的，因为你不考虑，因为你不意识到，考虑然后意识到，这就是你必须做的事情，这就是你必须看到的事情，如果我可以，如果我可以，有一种力场从罪中发出，你知道，基于影子的老广播节目，一个角色在东方学会了如何遮蔽周围人的思想，以便他们看不到他，它成为了一部电影，去年夏天没有人去看，但整个想法是影子是一个遮蔽人们思想的人，这就是罪，罪是影子，真正的影子，罪的本质是包含否认，你不会看到程度和规模，哦，是的，我们，当然，我是一个人，我犯错，我有缺陷，这不是承认你是一个罪人，这不是承认你是一个无助的罪人，正如多萝西·塞耶斯所说，我们心中有一种根本的内在错位，我们偏离中心，因为我们以自己为中心，我们能够做出巨大的邪恶，我希望，如果我能做到，我会让每个人都阅读19世纪末的诗人和哲学家和伟大的思想家，跨大西洋的两边，你知道，在欧洲和这里，他们说了什么，他们正在摆脱基督教，他们正在摆脱宗教，他们正在摆脱他们认为的迷信，他们说，哦，是的，我们终于带来了理性的政府方法，理性的贫困方法，理性的人类方法，我们已经摆脱了迷信，我们将看到令人难以置信的事情发生，我们将在20世纪看到贫困的结束，我们将在20世纪看到战争的结束，战争的结束，他们几乎都这样说，现在我们在哪里？他们的问题是什么，否认？他们，看，我的意思是，这里有两个伟大的两个绝佳的例子，我的意思是，有无数的例子，你知道，HG威尔斯和WHO，我喜欢引用他们，你知道，我不喜欢看到痛苦，但你看，多年的，你知道，他们从这个想法开始，我们不是罪人，在他们生命的尽头，经过多年的幻灭和多年的破碎，为什么？因为他们否认我们是罪人，最后他们被迫踢着尖叫着来到圣经可以一开始就指出的地方，多年浪费在上面。有一个女士，两个人在英国社会福利重建的基础上，悉尼和比阿特丽斯·韦伯，两位伟大的人做了很多好事，但他们在自己的生活中摆脱了基督教。1890年，比阿特丽斯·韦伯在她的日记中写下了这个词，她说，我把一切都押在了人性本善上。35年后，在她的日记中，她提醒自己她在1890年所说的话，她引用了那句话，她说，我把一切都押在了人性本善上，但后来她说，我现在意识到我们内心的邪恶冲动和本能是多么持久，社会机器永远不会改变。她把她的一生都押在了社会机器将消除贫困，将消除暴力，将消除这些事情的想法上，因为我们本质上是好的，在她生命的尽头，她决定的唯一解决方案。她意识到，我现在看到，我现在知道，我们内心的邪恶本能和冲动是多么持久。她把她的一生都押在了一件事情上。圣经可以一开始就告诉她，她在否认。最近，有一个叫厄内斯特·贝克的人，获得了普利策奖，他是一位社会科学家。他写了两本关于邪恶的书。第一本关于邪恶的书被称为邪恶的结构。在那本书中，他说世界的真正问题，我们有贫困的原因，我们有战争的原因，我们有暴力的原因是因为特权阶层通过压迫性的社会结构压迫其他人，因此他说，应用于政府的社会科学将处理邪恶。在他去世后不久，他的最后一本书被出版，名为逃避邪恶，在序言中，你知道他说了什么？他完全改变了，他说，我现在在这本书中第一次直面人类。他说，在我之前的作品中，我没有看到人类行为是多么恶劣，然后得到这个引用，这是我和许多其他人一起被困住的困境，他们一直试图保持启蒙传统的活力。这个巨大的问题是看到人类是如此邪恶，现在需要一些第三种选择，超越官僚科学或绝望。你知道他在说什么吗？这是我一生中我认为官僚科学，这仅仅意味着应用于更好的学校，立法，更好的法规，更好地工作在人们身上，你看，应用于官僚的社会科学，这将处理邪恶。现在我第一次看到，经过多年的面对我的一生，我现在看到必须有某种第三种方式，因为官僚科学不起作用，我们不能只是绝望，那是什么第三种方式？考虑然后意识到，当你离弃耶和华你的神时，这对你是多么邪恶和痛苦。换句话说，圣经说，怎么了？怎么了？为什么要花你的一生在否认中，最后被踢着尖叫着来到你永远不会看到思想家一开始就说人是坏蛋的地方，在他们生命的尽头，他们说现在我意识到人是美好的。永远不会发生，永远不会。总是相反。在他们生命的尽头，他们说我把我的一生都押在了，怎么能人们如此邪恶，怎么能人们如此邪恶？他们在否认。问题是什么？问题是什么？这不是经济问题。是罪。是罪。我们得继续。第一个要点是这个。罪的本质是包含对自身的否认。罪发出一种力场。罪是对我们是罪人的否认。我会快速地问你相信吗？你把它应用到自己身上吗？有时我想我会提出这些要点，我必须向你展示应用，例如，几个方式。例如，肯定有一些你们中的许多人说，我一般相信上帝的律法。我认为十诫是伟大的。我真的这样认为。大多数时候。但是我们可以把这两件事做得太过分。如果你在纽约一直诚实，你根本赚不到钱。如果你一直保持性纯洁，你根本不会有任何乐趣。道德律法在某个时间，在某个地方是相当不错的，但你可以过度这些事情。考虑并意识到你在否认罪的力量有多强大。你不能在上帝的律法上偷工减料。这样做表明你对你内心的力量一无所知。你对它的恶性和病态一无所知，你对罪的致命性一无所知。当你说，我可以玩弄它。这是一个灰色地带。我不知道这是对还是错。这似乎不对。谁知道呢？考虑并意识到。我们都倾向于否认。我们都倾向于低估。让我给你另一个例子。你们中的一些人说，偶尔我会发现你，但大多数时候我不会，因为很多人说，这里是我生活中有问题的一个领域。我知道。这里有一个缺陷。有一个性格缺陷。我不断地陷入其中。我不断地陷入其中。也许我应该告诉某人，不，不。我自己来做。我太尴尬了。我不想告诉其他人。我不想去找任何人寻求建议。我不想和一个好朋友分享这个，并说，请监督我。不，不，那太尴尬了。我自己来做。考虑。然后意识到。你在否认。我们总是在否认。我们总是低估罪的力量。总是这样。你总是认为我可以处理它。再来一个例子。有很多人，我认为，他们处于一个位置，他们现在从某人那里得到批评。这很容易100%地写掉，因为批评确实被夸大了，或者你可以看到那个人的动机是坏的。或者你可以看到他们说的很多东西是错误的。它没有被夸大，但他们说的很多东西实际上并不是真的错。所以也许你看着它，你说它主要是错的，或者它被夸大了，或者你可以，你知道，你考虑来源。你知道那个人是谁，那个人是个什么样的人，或者你知道那个人有什么动机。但是记住这一点。你应该对自己说，如果你认真对待罪本质上是否认的这一点，你应该不断地说，你知道，它可能被夸大了，它可能混杂着错误，它可能来自一个不太值得钦佩的来源。但上帝是否在试图告诉我一些事情？因为我知道根据我的本性，我倾向于否认那些真正错的事情。如果你相信我在这里告诉你的，你应该是最宽容的，当涉及到批评时。最开放的，当涉及到批评时，当你得到它时。你应该是最愿意倾听那些有话要告诉你的人，你应该是最不防御的人。如果你认真对待这一点，你会吗？我们无论在哪里看到破碎，战争，残酷和心痛。我们在我们周围的世界和我们自己的生活中感受到它。它是如何变成这样的，能做些什么呢？在他本月发布的新书中，世界出了什么问题？Tim Keller提供了一个清晰而富有同情心的答案。借鉴Redeemer的一系列教导，Keller博士展示了罪的现实如何解释我们周围看到的痛苦，以及只有福音才能提供持久的自由和治愈。无论你是被我们世界的状态压倒，还是在自己的错误或选择中挣扎，还是在寻找希望和快乐，世界出了什么问题将帮助你看到福音如何同时对我们世界的心痛和我们每个人内心的痛苦说话。这本新发布的书，世界出了什么问题，是我们感谢您本月的礼物，以帮助福音生活分享耶稣的好消息。今天就在gospelonlife.com/give请求你的副本。这是gospelonlife.com/give。现在这里是Keller博士带来的今天教学的其余部分。罪是否认，但其次和主要的是罪不仅仅是一般的否认。罪是什么否认的？我们说罪是一个否认，但特别是，对不起，上帝在这里告诉我们罪的本质是什么，它的核心是什么，罪的核心是什么。是什么？好吧，他说考虑并意识到当你离弃我时，这对你是多么邪恶和痛苦，但然后他告诉为什么他们离弃并没有敬畏我。这就是本质。这就是罪的本质。如果你问某人你知道定义罪，他们会说，罪是违反规则，罪是违反上帝的法律，如果你相信上帝，罪，那就是罪。这是对的，那就是罪，但罪是一种倾向，一种态度，一种立场，一种心态，保罗，在这里我不断说保罗，那是因为我记得其他时候。上帝在这段经文中说，为什么你离弃他的核心，为什么你犯罪，为什么你违反规则的原因，所有这一切的本质，没有敬畏。你没有敬畏我。让我告诉你为什么这是整个事情，这是所有事情的核心。我们正在阅读的新国际版，这个翻译，NIV翻译，说你没有敬畏我，但这里的词是圣经中使用的词，在大多数翻译中，它说你没有敬畏我。现在圣经的一个中心主题是敬畏耶和华，整个圣经中都有关于敬畏耶和华的讨论，这就是上帝所说的罪的本质。你没有敬畏耶和华，那么敬畏是什么意思？现在这里的问题是，在圣经中，敬畏这个词有两种不同的用法，而我们在现代常用的用法中只用其中一种。首先，圣经说有一种敬畏，在约翰一书4章中说有一种敬畏带有折磨。那是什么意思？嗯，这很简单。当我们使用敬畏这个词时，我们是以这种方式使用它。敬畏是对痛苦的预期。敬畏是对痛苦的预期，但看看敬畏是如何运作的。敬畏意味着你突然专注于将要发生在你身上的事情，当你被敬畏麻痹时，你可能会说当你被敬畏控制时，你专注于即将发生的事情，一切都以此为参考。如果你害怕，换句话说，例如，我不害怕，至少我不被昆虫吓到，所以如果我看到一只蜘蛛或者我在纽约看到一只蟑螂或类似的东西在四处游荡，我会说哦，它在那里，我不喜欢它。其他人可能会发现，也许这是不理性的，他们不能坐在一个有小蟑螂在四处游荡的房间里读书。为什么？他们不能，因为他们害怕它，好吗？他们被它吓到了，它让他们感到恐惧，它让他们感到困扰，这意味着他们不能做任何事情而不参考它，他们不能忘记它，它主宰着他们所做的一切，他们不能起床，只是你知道，喝杯咖啡，他们不能读书，他们不能，他们必须处理那只蟑螂。为什么？这就是敬畏所做的。敬畏吸引你，它让你对一个对象感到困扰，以至于你不能做任何事情，除非以它为参考，但然后圣经谈到一种不同的敬畏，在箴言28章14节中，它说快乐的是常常敬畏的人，什么？快乐的是常常敬畏的人。我们读到杰夫用它作为我们的鼓励之词，它在诗篇130章第4节中说，因为你赦免了我的罪，我敬畏你，什么？这里有什么有趣的，当涉及到上帝时，圣经称之为敬畏的东西，这是一种积极的敬畏，而不是消极的敬畏，但你看为什么？你说，为什么使用这个词？这是一种对上帝的内在敬畏，这是一种对他伟大的内在愉悦。你说，为什么称之为敬畏？你看他们有什么共同点？积极的敬畏没有折磨。在消极的敬畏中，你完全专注于自己。在积极的敬畏中，你被祝福地从思考自己中解放出来。在消极的敬畏中，你被麻痹，在积极的敬畏中，你被赋予力量，但这里是他们的共同点。敬畏耶和华意味着他是绝对的中心。你不能做任何事情而不参考他。无论你做什么，你都说，这与上帝有什么关系？这如何影响我与上帝的关系？这与上帝有什么关系？因为你看到了他的伟大和他的伟大，他现在是完全和绝对的中心。你可能做的任何事情或想的任何事情都不能不参考他的荣耀，他的伟大，他的爱，他的力量。你看到了吗？现在上帝说这就是罪的本质，这就是一切的本质。换句话说，上帝是如此聪明，上帝正在深入违反。你说，嗯，你说罪是违反法律。当你撒谎，当你自私，当你残忍，当你做这些事情时，那就是罪。好吧，上帝说，但你为什么会这样做？你为什么会不服从？你为什么会残忍？你为什么会撒谎？为什么？答案是每当你以某种方式犯罪时，在那一点上，你对某物的敬畏超过了对上帝的敬畏，某物你觉得比上帝更美妙，某物比上帝更有活力，某物比上帝更吸引人，某物比上帝更令人敬畏。你看到了吗？在那一点上，这就是你犯罪的原因。让我应用这个，因为我们开始结束这里。让我应用这个。你明白吗？首先，让我以几种不同的方式应用它。有几种方式。首先，你看到，因此，没有办法，没有办法，当涉及到上帝时，可以有半途而废的措施。上帝说，罪的本质是没有我在你生活的正中心，没有我在你思想的正中心。如果你有一点宗教信仰，如果你有一点道德，如果你有点宗教信仰，换句话说，你不能有一个上帝有时，你不能有一个上帝作为维生素补充剂。多年前，一位女士在一个基督教会议上教导，我从未忘记她所说的话。一位女士在一个基督教会议上教导，她说，如果从地球到太阳的距离，那9300万英里只是一个纸张的厚度。你知道从地球到最近的星星的距离将是70英尺高的纸张堆吗？你知道我们银河系的直径将是310英里高的纸张堆吗？你意识到我们知道的有数万亿个星系吗？你知道如果有一个创造者上帝，那创造者上帝用他的大能之言将这一切维持在一起吗？现在，她说，如果他在那里，你怎么可能要求这样一个人，这样一个上帝进入你的生活，有时作为一个助手，作为一种让你度过难关的方式？你不明白为什么罪是否认吗？罪在其本质上是否认，因为它与现实脱节。如果有一个上帝，你怎么能以任何其他方式与他建立关系，除非你以完全和绝对的奉献与他建立关系？这就是为什么保罗在罗马书中说，我终于为保罗找到一个。保罗在罗马书12章第1节中说，在旧的钦定版中，它被这样翻译，使自己成为上帝的活祭，这是你合理的服务。罪是不理性的。要么有一个上帝，但如果有一个上帝，我们会到这个地方说，如果有一个上帝，他必须是中心。他必须是一个你不能不参考的人。你必须做一切以他为参考，一切。你的生活中永远没有一个领域，你可以说，好吧，你甚至不考虑上帝会怎么说。上帝对此有什么看法？永远。你明白吗？哦，你的问题，你的生活如此邪恶和痛苦的原因，没有敬畏。让我给你另一个应用，智力上，智力上。你知道，当圣经说上帝的非中心性不仅是我们所有个人问题的原因，而且是我们所有智力问题的原因。在像曼哈顿这样的地方，我应该说点什么。你们中有很多学生，学者，思想家，顾问，上帝说敬畏耶和华是智慧的开端，是智慧的开端，除非上帝在你的智力体系中是强迫性的中心。如果这里有什么有趣的关于这节经文的地方，你不明白当你离弃我时，这对你是多么邪恶和痛苦。如果你对上帝没有敬畏，这不仅仅是你践踏他的荣耀，你践踏你的荣耀。如果你不理解上帝，你就不会理解自己。斯蒂芬·古尔德在哈佛大学教书，不相信上帝。因此，他说，任何不相信上帝的人都必须说的话。他说，我们为什么在这里？我们在这里是因为一群奇怪的鱼有一种特殊的解剖结构，可以转化为腿。我们可能渴望一个更高的答案，但没有。我们不能将生命的意义读入自然的事实中。现在，他在说什么。去掉上帝。对上帝没有敬畏，那么对自己就没有敬畏。如果上帝没有荣耀，你就没有荣耀。你是一个无意义的动物。对此没有更高的答案。你知道你剩下什么吗？你剩下一个无意义的生活。你知道为什么吗？因为你剩下一个令人难以置信的差距在你如何感受和如何运作以及你必须是什么之间。你必须是一个无意义的动物。当你爱上某人时，你坐下来，你从不说当你亲吻他或她时。你从不说，这只是神经化学。没有所谓的爱。我只是一个动物。这就是我的大脑在运作。但事实就是这样。除非有一个上帝。如果你对上帝没有敬畏，这对你是邪恶和痛苦的。如果在你的思想中对上帝没有敬畏，就不可能对爱的概念有任何敬畏或敬畏。爱什么都不是。它只是神经化学。当你想到善与恶的概念时，你相信有些事情真的错了吗？你见过事情吗？你听说过事情吗？你读过事情吗？你说那真的错了吗？如果没有上帝，那只是一个社会建构。那只是文化。没有。你不明白吗？没有什么重要的。没有什么是令人敬畏的。没有什么是美妙的，除非上帝是美妙的。敬畏耶和华是智慧的开端。如果你对我没有敬畏，你就不会对任何事情有敬畏。你不会对自己有任何敬畏。罪的教义，他们说，是悲观的。你在开玩笑吗？如果你没有罪的教义，就只有绝望，没有别的。你不考虑并意识到当你离弃我并对我没有敬畏时，这对你是多么邪恶和痛苦。你所有的个人问题都是因为上帝在你的生活中不是中心。我们所有的智力问题都是因为上帝在我们的思想中不是中心。在这里，最后，亲爱的朋友们，基督徒朋友们，我想让你们考虑这一点。你所有的自我控制问题都是因为上帝不是中心。你说，这怎么可能？嗯，这很简单。你是否在担心上有麻烦？你是否在自怜上有麻烦？你是否在内疚上有麻烦？无论你有什么麻烦，只要以这些术语来看。当你担心时，你对某个因素的力量比你对上帝的力量更敬畏。当你内疚时，你对你的罪的力量比你对他的恩典的力量更敬畏。当你自怜时，你对你失去的某个伟大利益比你对他的怜悯更敬畏。当你确信你生活中的一切都出错时，你对自己的智慧比你对他的智慧更敬畏。因此，你知道你需要什么吗？这就是为什么诗篇作者说，敬畏耶和华是洁净的。没有什么能像这样清理你。当你坐下来时，你不仅仅是为了获得一点知识而学习圣经。当你来教会时，我希望你不仅仅是为了获得智慧。你需要看到上帝。敬畏耶和华，敬畏，你需要实际上说，哦，圣灵，打开我的眼睛，让我看到敬畏，因为当你看到他比你生活中的任何因素更敬畏时，你的担忧就消失了。当你看到他的恩典比你生活中的任何罪更敬畏时，你的内疚就消失了。当你看到他的怜悯比你生活中缺失的任何因素更敬畏时，你的自怜就消失了。当你看到上帝的智慧比你的任何智慧和你生活中的任何小计划更敬畏时，你的愤怒就消失了。你比任何其他事情都需要看到他。说，哦，圣灵，放大他。让他的荣耀被知道。你需要奋斗，直到你看到他，直到你觉得这可能。圣经说你可以接近他。你需要那个。无论你今天晚上有什么问题，今天，无论你这周有什么问题，无论你有什么问题，它都可以通过敬畏耶和华来清理。无论你的方舟多么污秽都可以被清理。如果你去找他，你说这对我来说是邪恶和痛苦的，我否认了你，我否认了你的中心地位。你知道他会说什么吗？他说，当然我会接纳你。当然我会接纳你。如果你不这样做，如果你出来说，好吧，我是如此邪恶，我是如此邪恶，我是如此坏，那为什么上帝会接纳我？这里是你不够敬畏的一个方面，他的恩典。在第6节中，整个段落中一遍又一遍地说，没有人说带我们从埃及上来的耶和华在哪里？你知道他在说什么吗？他说，想想我。你知道为什么你不服从我吗？你知道为什么你不让我成为中心。你不相信我的爱。你不相信我的恩典。他说，记住出埃及。想一想。记住我没有在埃及给你律法，然后说，现在如果你服从，我会带你出来。我先带你出来，然后我后来给你律法。我是一个恩典的上帝。那么你为什么害怕让我成为中心？我知道为什么他说，你觉得你会失去你的自由。你会失去你的快乐。你看，你不会自由。你不会有你的选择。如果我服从并让上帝成为中心，我会在某种程度上受到限制。上帝说，为什么你不说那个恩典的上帝在哪里，他带我们出来？那个恩典的上帝在哪里，他通过恩典运作？这就是为什么我在这里对你说，除非你最终对他的恩典感到敬畏，而不仅仅是敬畏，你不能说，我应该停止犯罪，否则上帝会惩罚我。你应该说，我应该停止犯罪，因为这是那个恩典的上帝，他带我出来，带我上来。所以如果你去找他说，我的生活是邪恶和痛苦的，因为我一直生活在否认我是罪人的状态中，我一直生活在否认你的中心地位和伟大中。上帝会说什么？我是那个带你上来的。我是一个恩典的上帝。当然，我会接纳你。我派我的儿子过你的生活，死于你的死亡。这就是我现在如何带人们出埃及。这就是我如何在没有律法的情况下带人们出来，而是通过恩典。这就是我如何带你上来并把你的罪除掉，因为基督履行了律法。考虑并意识到如果你不敬畏我的恩典和怜悯，这对你是多么邪恶和痛苦。所以，这是解决你所有个人问题的解决方案。这是解决我们社会问题的解决方案。这是解决方案。上帝说，这就是你的问题。这不是经济问题，但这是罪，这是我能给你的最好消息。让我们祈祷。父啊，我们感谢你，现在我们有可能知道什么是真正可知的，已经有数千年了，但人们不断地转离它。他们不断地否认它。我们意识到，父啊，我们必须穿过我们自己的否认力场，看到你的伟大和你的现实。我们祈求，父啊，你会向我们展示你的爱和你的恩典，以便我们信任自己，把你放在首位。我们请求，父啊，你会向我们展示如何通过寻求你的敬畏和寻求你的敬畏和看到你的伟大来解决我们个人的问题。通过你的圣灵将这些真理应用到我们的生活中。我们奉耶稣的名请求。阿门。感谢你加入我们在福音生活播客中。我们希望今天的教导鼓励你更深入地进入上帝的话语。你可以通过评分和评论来帮助其他人发现这个播客，并找到更多由Tim
