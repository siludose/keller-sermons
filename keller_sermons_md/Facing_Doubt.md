### Introduction: The Challenge of Public Faith

Welcome to Gospel and Life! How comfortable are you when it comes to being open about your faith? This month on the podcast, Tim Keller looks at what the Bible says about having a public faith. He shows us what it looks like to be open about our faith in a pluralistic society, in a way that creates civility and peace and meaningful dialogue with our neighbors.

The Scripture reading is from Psalm chapter 73 verses 1 through 3 and 12 through 26.

> Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart, but as for me, my feet had almost slipped, I had nearly lost my foothold. For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.

**This is God's word.**

So, we are in a series called public faith, sharing the hope that is within. We live in a society, Western society, that does not encourage people to be public about their faith, their religious beliefs. We are told that it is a private thing we should not be talking about, but it is ironic because our culture actually encourages us to be absolutely open and public about everything else, everything else, including sexuality, because it is who we are.

### Part 1: Understanding Doubt

#### 1. The Nature of Doubt

The Bible, however, doesn't look at doubt anywhere nearly as positive or as negative as that. The Bible doesn't say it is as positive as secular people do, or as negative as religious people do. Because actually doubt is not so simplistic, it's not at all good, it's not all bad, and only when you begin to see it in a nuanced way can doubt actually be something through which we make progress.

#### 2. The Metaphor of Doubt

The metaphor for doubt that's used is in verse two. **For me, my feet had almost slipped, I nearly lost my foothold.** Now that's a great image. When you're losing your foothold, for a moment you've lost your balance, and when you've lost your balance, you're experiencing a certain kind of a vertigo, a kind of disorientation, you know, a certain dizziness.

### Part 2: Causes of Doubt

#### 1. Intellectual and Personal Causes

Now there's two things he points out. First of all, he says, I saw something, secondly, he says, I experienced something. What did he see? Verse 1, 2 and 3 puts it in a nutshell. **God is good. God is good to those who are in pure and heart.** Now that's the doctrine of God. That's a traditional biblical doctrine of God. God is a good God.

#### 2. The Role of Experience

But he's not just an intellectual problem. Because he also, it's not just he sees something, he experiences something. First hand, verse 13, 14, 16, he says, **Surely in vain, I have kept my heart pure, I have washed my hands in innocence.**

### Part 3: Transforming Doubt

#### 1. Experience and Thinking

Experience, thinking, and a enlarged view of God. Experience, thinking, and a enlarged view of God, okay, first of all, experience. This is going to be kind of counterintuitive, but where does the turn happen?

#### 2. Enlarged View of God

When my heart was grieved and my spirit embittered, I was senseless and ignorant, I was a brute beast before you, yet I'm always with you. You hold me by my right hand.

**Let's pray.**

Our Father, we pray that you make us great through our doubts. We pray that you would move us to new levels through our doubts. But we pray that you would help us to know what to do with our doubts and we have gotten some pretty good instruction from this passage, this scripture.

**We thank you that we're saved by grace through Jesus and we pray that you would help us to grow in grace because of what he did.**

Make all this true and realize in our lives, we pray this in Jesus' name, amen.

### 引言：公共信仰的挑战

欢迎来到福音与生活！当谈到公开你的信仰时，你有多自在？本月的播客中，Tim Keller 探讨了圣经对公共信仰的看法。他向我们展示了在多元社会中如何公开我们的信仰，以一种创造文明、和平和与邻居有意义对话的方式。

经文选自诗篇第 73 章第 1 至 3 节和第 12 至 26 节。

> 神实在恩待以色列那些清心的人，但至于我，我的脚几乎失闪，我的脚险些滑跌。因为我嫉妒狂傲的人，见恶人享平安。

**这是神的话语。**

所以，我们正在进行一个名为公共信仰的系列，分享我们内心的希望。我们生活在一个不鼓励人们公开他们的信仰、宗教信仰的社会，西方社会。我们被告知这是一个私人事务，我们不应该谈论它，但具有讽刺意味的是，我们的文化实际上鼓励我们对其他一切事情绝对开放和公开，包括性，因为这是我们的身份。

### 第一部分：理解怀疑

#### 1. 怀疑的本质

然而，圣经对怀疑的看法既不像世俗人那样积极，也不像宗教人士那样消极。圣经并不认为怀疑像世俗人所说的那样积极，也不像宗教人士所说的那样消极。因为实际上怀疑并不是那么简单，它既不是完全好的，也不是完全坏的，只有当你开始以一种微妙的方式看待它时，怀疑才能成为我们取得进步的途径。

#### 2. 怀疑的隐喻

怀疑的隐喻在第二节中使用。**至于我，我的脚几乎失闪，我的脚险些滑跌。** 这是一个很好的形象。当你失去立足点时，你暂时失去了平衡，当你失去平衡时，你会经历某种眩晕，一种迷失方向的感觉。

### 第二部分：怀疑的原因

#### 1. 知识和个人原因

现在他指出了两件事。首先，他说，我看到了什么，其次，他说，我经历了什么。他看到了什么？第 1、2 和 3 节概括了这一点。**神是好的。神恩待那些清心的人。** 这是关于神的教义。这是一个传统的圣经教义。神是一个好神。

#### 2. 经验的角色

但他不仅仅是一个知识性的问题。因为他也不仅仅是看到了一些东西，他还经历了一些东西。亲身经历，第 13、14、16 节，他说，**我实在徒然洁净了我的心，徒然洗手表明无辜。**

### 第三部分：转化怀疑

#### 1. 经验与思考

经验、思考和对神的扩展视野。经验、思考和对神的扩展视野，好吧，首先是经验。这有点违反直觉，但转折点在哪里发生？

#### 2. 扩展的神观

当我的心发酸，灵被刺痛时，我是无知的，如畜类一般在你面前，然而我常与你同在。你拉着我的右手。

**让我们祷告。**

我们的父，我们祈求你通过我们的怀疑使我们伟大。我们祈求你通过我们的怀疑将我们提升到新的层次。但我们祈求你帮助我们知道如何处理我们的怀疑，我们从这段经文中得到了相当好的指导。

**我们感谢你，我们是因耶稣的恩典得救，我们祈求你帮助我们因他所做的而在恩典中成长。**

让这一切在我们的生活中成真，我们奉耶稣的名祷告，阿门。
