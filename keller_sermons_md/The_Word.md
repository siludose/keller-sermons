### Introduction: The Word

Tim Keller is looking at a passage from the opening chapter of the Gospel of John. John begins his account of Christ's birth, not with the shepherds or angels, but with the mystery of the word becoming flesh. God himself, entering the world as a person in Jesus Christ, join us as Tim Keller explores the meaning of Jesus' birth. Tonight's scripture comes from the book of John, chapter 1, verses 1 through 11.

> "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through Him, all things were made, without Him, nothing was made that has been made. In Him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through Him all might believe. He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light. The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world. He was in the world, and though the world was made through Him, the world did not recognize Him. He came to that which was His own, but His own did not receive Him."

This is the Word of the Lord.

### The Need for Light

Well, we're going to be doing for the weeks of Advent, which are the four weeks going up to Christmas. It's taking a look at the first chapter of John. We've been in John chapter 13 to 17. We're looking at the first chapter because John chapter 1 is about Jesus coming into the world. It's basically John's way of talking about the meaning of Christmas. And even though there's many things that can be said about this very, very famous passage, seven times the word light shows up here.

**We need light, human beings need a light, that there is a light, and then how we can connect to it, how we can receive it.**

Now, first of all, the need for light, especially since verses 4 and 5, "In Him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it."

### The Existence of Light

Now, see here in verse 4, obviously there's light and there's lights, and here's lights, and you see the lights. But there is something that down in verse 9 is called the true light, that everyone needs, and in verse 4 is the light of mankind, which means there's a kind of light that we all need.

> "The world is a dark place, and we do not know how to enlighten ourselves."

### Connecting to the Light

When the Bible talks about light and darkness, what is that symbolism? Well, it's really that hard, it's what it, you'd think it means. First of all, to be dark sometimes means evil and suffering. Darkness means evil and suffering. We talk about the dark times in our lives, so we're in a dark place in our lives.

**The world's a dark place, the world continues to have all those things.**

But darkness can also mean ignorance. You know, if I'm in a dark room, I don't know what's in the room, and I'm stumbling, and I'm falling, because I'm in a dark, meaning to be in the dark can mean evil and suffering. The meaning of dark, I can't see reality.

> "The world is filled with evil and suffering, and we do not have the ability or knowledge to know how to solve it."

Now, this is the very first, you might say, clue to what the Bible says, the meaning of Christmas, the meaning of Jesus coming in the world is. And that is, this world is a dark place, and if there is going to be any light, it has to come from outside the human race.

## 中文翻译

### 引言：道

Tim Keller 正在查考约翰福音开篇的一段经文。约翰开始讲述基督的诞生，不是从牧羊人或天使开始，而是从道成肉身的奥秘开始。上帝自己以耶稣基督的身份进入世界，加入我们，Tim Keller 探讨耶稣诞生的意义。今晚的经文来自约翰福音第一章，第一到十一节。

> "太初有道，道与神同在，道就是神。这道太初与神同在。万物是借着他造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是借着他造的。生命在他里头，这生命就是人的光。光照在黑暗里，黑暗却不接受光。有一个人，是从神那里差来的，名叫约翰。这人来，为要作见证，就是为光作见证，叫众人因他可以信。他不是那光，乃是要为光作见证。那光是真光，照亮一切生在世上的人。他在世界，世界也是借着他造的，世界却不认识他。他到自己的地方来，自己的人倒不接待他。"

这是主的话。

### 对光的需求

好吧，我们将在将临期的几周内进行，这是圣诞节前的四周。我们正在查考约翰福音的第一章。我们一直在约翰福音第13到17章。我们正在查考第一章，因为约翰福音第一章是关于耶稣来到世界的。这基本上是约翰谈论圣诞意义的方式。即使关于这段非常非常著名的经文可以说很多事情，这里出现了七次光这个词。

**我们需要光，人类需要光，有光，然后我们如何与之连接，如何接受它。**

首先，尤其是第4和第5节中提到的光的需求，“生命在他里头，这生命就是人的光。光照在黑暗里，黑暗却不接受光。”

### 光的存在

现在，看这里的第4节，显然有光和灯，这里有灯，你看到灯。但在第9节中有一种被称为真光的东西，每个人都需要，在第4节中是人类的光，这意味着我们都需要一种光。

> "世界是一个黑暗的地方，我们不知道如何启蒙自己。"

### 与光的连接

当圣经谈论光和黑暗时，这种象征意义是什么？嗯，这真的很难，这就是它的意思。首先，黑暗有时意味着邪恶和痛苦。黑暗意味着邪恶和痛苦。我们谈论生活中的黑暗时期，所以我们处于生活中的黑暗地方。

**世界是一个黑暗的地方，世界继续拥有所有这些东西。**

但黑暗也可以意味着无知。你知道，如果我在一个黑暗的房间里，我不知道房间里有什么，我在绊倒，我在跌倒，因为我在黑暗中，意思是处于黑暗中可以意味着邪恶和痛苦。黑暗的意义，我看不到现实。

> "世界充满了邪恶和痛苦，我们没有能力或知识知道如何解决它。"

现在，这是你可能说的第一个线索，圣经所说的圣诞节的意义，耶稣来到世界的意义是。这是一个黑暗的世界，如果有光，它必须来自人类之外。
