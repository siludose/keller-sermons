### Introduction: The Problem of Sin

Why is the world so broken? And why are we capable of inflicting such harm, even toward those we love? People point to politics, poverty, or psychology, but none of these fully explain what we see in ourselves and in history. This month on the podcast, Tim Keller is teaching from a series exploring the question, what's wrong with us? Knowing us how the Bible's teaching on sin offers the only explanation deep enough to face the truth in all its complexity, and the only hope, powerful enough to transform us.

> Jeremiah 21 to 8 and 23 to 32. It's printed there. This is the beginning and the ending of this great chapter in the book of the Prophet, Jeremiah.

**The word of the Lord came to me, go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem, I remember the devotion of your youth, how as a bride you loved me, and followed me through the desert through a land not sewn, Israel was holy to the Lord, the first fruits of his harvest, all who devoured her were held guilty, and disaster overtook them, declares the Lord.**

### Part 1: Dynamics of Spiritual Attraction

#### 1. Spiritual Attraction

All through here he is using remarkable sexual imagery. One verse which I left out, I was trying to say well I can't print the whole chapter but we are looking in a sense of the whole chapter and there is one verse that is very very interesting.

- God is calling them to task for the fact they are turning to idols, they are worshiping other gods, they are not worshiping him.
- He uses remarkable sexual imagery of a young married couple just hopelessly in love.

**On every high hill and under every spreading tree you spread your legs.**

#### 2. The Power of Spiritual Attraction

Why would God use that kind of imagery? Is he just trying to get our attention? No, it's for teaching value because this is what he's teaching all through here.

- There is an attraction going on at the spiritual level in your heart right now, every bit is powerful as the sexual attraction at the physical level.
- Your spiritual relationship with that thing is every bit as powerful as a physical relationship is and a sexual one at that.

### Part 2: Dynamics of Spiritual Addiction

#### 1. The Cycle of Addiction

If you don't have me in your arms, if you're in the arms of anything else, you're in deep trouble, you're actually in an addiction cycle.

- You promote something good, not a sin, and you say to them, you made me, you define me, you are my father.
- That leads to addiction, you can't be restrained.

**Do not run until your feet are bare and your throat is dry, but you said, it is no use. I love foreign gods, I must go after them.**

#### 2. The Consequences of Addiction

The fastest way to tell is when you're in trouble.

- When something goes wrong, you realize the things you built your life on can't possibly save you.
- The addiction cycle: promote, get addicted, and then those things desert us in our time of greatest need.

### Part 3: Dynamics of Spiritual Restoration

#### 1. Personalize Your Understanding of Sin

Read verses 1 to 3 with me.

- Sin is breaking the heart of God.
- Until you understand that that's how God feels about sin, you don't understand sin.

#### 2. Remember Grace

Look at verse 5 and 6.

- Spiritually make real what Jesus has done for you.
- Remember grace, find ways of making it spiritually real to you.

#### 3. Look in the Mirror

Verse 32 is an amazing verse.

- God promises to make you spiritually perfect and beautiful.
- Jesus Christ came to present us spotless and radiant, a bride.

**If you look at yourself in the mirror, if you're willing to see what I have done for you, if you understand how beautiful you are in my sight because of what my son has done for you, you'll be free from your least lover gods forever.**

Let's pray.

Thank you Father as we look at this passage for the profound analysis of our souls that it gives us and for the complete program of renovation and restoration it gives us. We thank you that it's possible now for us to have our hearts melted by the knowledge of your love for us to have our hearts maintained and changed by the remembrance of your grace for us and most of all to be completely changed by the knowledge of what your son has not just done for us but what your son is for us. With Lord these things are very very deep, they're wonderful. If some of us have never heard this before since some people here today have never even heard this understanding of Christianity and we pray Father that those of us who have heard it many times before that through the Holy Spirit you'll become active in a way that it's never been before and for those of us who have never heard it before that this is just the beginning the first step of a journey and that it will end in your arms. Now Father give us what you want to give us give us yourself we pray this in Jesus name amen.

### 引言：罪的问题

为什么世界如此破碎？为什么我们能够对我们所爱的人造成如此大的伤害？人们指向政治、贫穷或心理学，但这些都无法完全解释我们在自己和历史中看到的现象。本月的播客中，Tim Keller 从一个系列中教授，探索这个问题：我们哪里出了问题？了解圣经关于罪的教导如何提供唯一足够深刻的解释，以面对所有复杂性的真相，以及唯一足够强大的希望来改变我们。

> 耶利米书 21 到 8 和 23 到 32。它印在那里。这是先知耶利米书中这一伟大章节的开头和结尾。

**耶和华的话临到我说，你去在耶路撒冷人的耳中宣告说，耶和华如此说，我记得你幼年的恩爱，你怎样作为新娘爱我，跟随我经过未曾撒种的旷野，以色列是归耶和华为圣的，是他初熟的土产，凡吞吃他的必算为有罪，灾祸必临到他们，这是耶和华说的。**

### 第一部分：属灵吸引的动态

#### 1. 属灵吸引

在这里，他使用了非凡的性意象。我省略了一节，我试图说我不能打印整章，但我们实际上是在看整章，其中有一节非常有趣。

- 神责备他们转向偶像，崇拜其他神，而不是崇拜他。
- 他使用了年轻已婚夫妇无可救药地相爱的非凡性意象。

**在每一个高冈上和每一棵茂盛的树下，你张开双腿。**

#### 2. 属灵吸引的力量

为什么神会使用这样的意象？他只是想引起我们的注意吗？不，这是为了教学价值，因为这是他在这里一直在教导的。

- 你心中现在正在发生一种属灵层面的吸引力，每一部分都像身体层面的性吸引力一样强大。
- 你与那事物的属灵关系每一部分都像身体关系一样强大，甚至是性关系。

### 第二部分：属灵成瘾的动态

#### 1. 成瘾循环

如果你没有我在你的怀中，如果你在其他任何事物的怀中，你就有麻烦了，你实际上是在一个成瘾循环中。

- 你提升一些好的东西，不是罪，然后对它们说，你创造了我，你定义了我，你是我的父。
- 这导致成瘾，你无法被抑制。

**不要跑到你的脚赤裸，喉咙干渴，但你说，没有用。我爱外邦的神，我必须追随他们。**

#### 2. 成瘾的后果

最快的方法是当你遇到麻烦时。

- 当事情出错时，你意识到你建立生活的东西根本无法拯救你。
- 成瘾循环：提升，成瘾，然后那些东西在我们最需要的时候抛弃我们。

### 第三部分：属灵恢复的动态

#### 1. 个性化你对罪的理解

和我一起读第1到3节。

- 罪是伤害神的心。
- 直到你理解那就是神对罪的感受，你才理解罪。

#### 2. 记住恩典

看第5和6节。

- 在属灵上使耶稣为你所做的事情变得真实。
- 记住恩典，找到使其在属灵上对你真实的方法。

#### 3. 照镜子

第32节是一个惊人的经文。

- 神承诺使你在属灵上完美和美丽。
- 耶稣基督来是为了使我们无瑕疵和光辉，成为新娘。

**如果你在镜子中看自己，如果你愿意看到我为你所做的事情，如果你理解因为我儿子为你所做的事情你在我眼中是多么美丽，你将永远从你最小的情人神中得到自由。**

让我们祷告。

感谢父神，当我们看这段经文时，为它给我们灵魂的深刻分析和它给我们完整的翻新和恢复计划而感谢你。我们感谢你，现在我们可以通过对你对我们的爱的知识来融化我们的心，通过对你为我们的恩典的记忆来维持和改变我们的心，最重要的是，通过对你儿子不仅为我们所做的事情而且是他为我们的事情的知识来完全改变我们。主，这些事情非常非常深刻，它们是美好的。如果我们中的一些人从未听过这些，因为今天有些人从未听过这种对基督教的理解，我们祈求父神，那些我们已经听过很多次的人，通过圣灵，你会以一种从未有过的方式变得活跃，对于那些从未听过的人来说，这只是旅程的开始的第一步，并且它将在你的怀中结束。现在父神，给我们你想给我们的，给我们你自己。我们奉耶稣的名祷告，阿门。
