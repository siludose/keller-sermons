Welcome to Gospel in Life.  Some people say the fundamental problem of the world is poverty.  Others say it's bad systems, poor education, or biology, but what if none of these can  fully explain the brokenness we see, both in the headlines and in our own hearts?  In today's teaching, Tim Keller looks at how the Bible's teaching on sin gives us a deeply  honest and yet incredibly hopeful view of the world.  Turn to a part of your bulletin where you have the passage on which the Scripture  is based, and we're starting this week a new series, and it's on sin and there's nothing  more fundamentally relevant and practical than to understand the answer to the fundamental  human question, what's wrong with us?  If you're trying to raise a family or run a corporation or if you have political or community  involvement and if anything you do in this life, you need to have a working theory of  an answer to that question, what's wrong with us?  Why the selfishness, the cruelty, the corruption, the crime, the racism, the injustice?  Why?  Where does it come from?  Now the Bible's answer is ancient and it's profound and that is sin in the human heart.  One of the reasons why it's so widely rejected, I believe, is actually because what's not  understood is that the biblical understanding and doctrine of sin is multidimensional.  All of us understand or remember, I think they understand what the Bible says about sin.  We say yes, we know what the Bible says about sin.  Sin is breaking God's law and therefore we're guilty and condemned, yes, I know what the  Bible says, but that's only one.  In fact, that's the last of the aspects of sin that we're going to look at in this series.  I think one of the reasons why sin as an answer to the reason to the problems of our life  is tends to be widely overlooked by people is because we don't understand the multidimensionality  than how nuanced, how rich, see, how multi-perspectival the biblical teaching on sin is.  We're going to look at the first of those dimensions today and we're going to read a  passage of scripture that I can almost proudly say, it's very possible and very likely that  even if you've gone to church all of your life, you've never heard anybody so stupid as  to try to preach a sermon on this text.  This text is almost never preached on, I've never preached on, it's almost never studied.  It's the end of the book of Judges and one of the reasons why nobody knows what to do  with it, why it's there and so but nobody ever tries to speak about it is because it is  so inexplicably boring.  Judges 17 versus 1 to 13, it's just the beginning of a story and I'll tell you how it ends.  You don't need to know.  Now a man named Micah from the hill country of Ephraim said to his mother,  you know the 1100 chequels of silver that were taken from you and about which I heard  you order a curse?  I have that silver with me.  I took it.  And then his mother said, the Lord bless you my son and when he returned the 1100 chequels  of silver to his mother she said, I solemnly consecrate my silver to the Lord for my son  to make a carved image and a cast idol.  I will give it back to you, O Lord see.  So he returned the silver to his mother and she took 200 chequels of silver and gave  them to a silversmith who made them into the image and the idol and they were put in  Micah's house.  Now this man Micah had a shrine and he made an effort and some idols and installed one  of his sons as his priest.  In those days Israel had no king.  Everyone did as he saw fit a young Levite from Bethlehem and Judah who had been living  within the clan of Judah left that town in search of some other place to stay and on  his way he came to Micah's house in the hill country of Ephraim and Micah asked him,  where are you from?  Oh I'm a Levite from Bethlehem and Judah he asked he said, and I'm looking for a place  to stay then Micah said to him, live with me and be my father and priest and I'll give  you 10 chequels of silver a year your clothes and your food.  So the Levite agreed to live with him and the young man was to him like one of his sons  and then Micah installed a Levite and the young man became his priest and lived in his  house and Micah said, now I know that the Lord will be good to me since this Levite has  become my priest.  Now let me tell you what we have here.  One of the reasons why people ignore this section or really find it kind of confusing  is this, up to now everything in the book of Judges has been extremely interesting.  Book of Judges is a history of Israel after they came into Canaan, they had been led there  by Moses and Joshua out of Egypt and they came into Canaan and what we have in the book  of Judges the first 16 chapters is a series of fascinating stories because over and over  the people would slide into sin and when they slide into sin they soon became enslaved  by some foreign power and then over and over again 12 times actually in the book God sends  a judge which is really a deliverer.  You mustn't think in terms of a magistrate or someone sitting at a bench.  A judge was a deliverer, essentially a savior and the judge would come and turn the people  bet away from sin back to God and liberate them from the military oppressors and it was  always fascinating.  I'm very dramatic and some of the most famous people.  We have Gideon here, we have Deborah here, we have Samson in this book and it's always thrilling  and exciting to see the salvation come, they're saved you see.  But then when you get to chapter 17 to chapter 21 there's these last five chapters and  they're very, very hard to understand because they don't seem to be about anything.  There's no judges in here, there's no salvation that comes, God hardly shows up in some ways.  And what's so intriguing is that there's two incidents.  In chapter 17 and 18 we have one and you've read half of it and in chapter 19 to 21 you  have the other and the first one we've already read and what do we see here?  Well first of all we see three, if you're going to give this story a title and it couldn't  be a very interesting title because it's not a very interesting story, it's a bunch of  trivial people doing kind of dumb, weird things.  I could call it Micah, Mom and the Levite.  And what you have is you have these three people, first all you have Micah, cheating his mother.  And then giving her the money back when she hears him, idling a curse against the robber  whoever it is and he says, well you know I'm, I did it, I robbed and I was kind of scared  when he's, you know he's not very good or very bad, I mean how good can you be to rob  your own mother but then how bad could you be to get, you know give it back, you know kind  of, gee I'm scared, you cursed, I wonder.  And then so you see Micah, cheating his mother, then you see his mother cheating God because  if you notice when she's really excited she says I will give it all back to the Lord.  I'm so happy about this, I'm so happy my son came back and did all, he says I solemnly  constrict my silver, all I give it back but when she actually came to it she only used  200 checkers and she makes two images, two idols out of silver and puts them in in a sense  her son's chapel where he worshiped the Lord.  In complete contradiction to everything God says anywhere, right in the tank of maim,  it's all through the law of Moses where he says you mustn't make images, you mustn't  make idols.  So first we have Micah cheating mom, then we have mom cheating God and then along comes  the Levite.  And on what's his point?  Well Micah and his mother decided they were going to have their own shrine.  See in those days there was a tabernacle, a sanctuary, a place where God said worship  me here and it was at Shiloh.  And in that tabernacle there was an effort that was the breastplate of a priest, that the  priest wore and had stones on there through which God spoke to people.  There was an effort and there was a priest and the priest had to be Levites, they had to  be on the tribe of Levi.  And there was a sanctuary where people could come and pray and worship.  But Micah and mom, they wanted to have their own sanctuary, they wanted to have their own  place of worship.  And so they made one of their sons, mom's grandson, Micah's son, a priest until along comes  the Levite and Micah says, wow, I can have a genuine Levite here, just like in the law  of Moses.  So he says how much would you know be willing to work for this amount and Levites says, sure,  fine.  And so now he says, boy, now I've really got a Levite, I've got an effort, I've got everything  I want.  Except in chapter 18, and this is how the story ends, a group of men come along, Danites,  they're trying to find a new place to live.  And they say to the Levite, you come with me, come with us, we'll pay you more.  And bring those images along, which, of course, were worth quite a bit of money.  And so Micah comes running out saying, you stole my Levite, you stole my images, what are  you doing in the Danites?  I'd say, go home or I might hurt you.  And so he did.  And that's how the story ends.  And then in chapter 19 to 21, suddenly, at the very end of the book of Judges, we're completely  unprepared.  After all these boring people doing all these trivial things, we're completely unprepared  for what happens.  There's a gang rape of a woman that leads to not just civil war between the tribes of Israel,  but genocidal destruction of whole towns and villages down to the infants.  And what's so strange about this, again, no judges, no salvation, no nothing, now what's  going on here.  Now, on the one hand, this is terrible storytelling.  Now when I say terrible storytelling, I don't mean I think this was just made up, but you  see this incident was chosen out of this whole period of history.  Why?  Why was it chosen?  When I say it's a bad story, first of all, in a good story, you have to somebody, some  character, who you get engaged with, that you care about, you have to have some character  that you're concerned about, otherwise it's just a terrible narrative.  And nobody here you care about, see, they're all, none of them are very good or very bad.  They're very shallow.  They're very uninteresting.  They're boring, they're very unprincipled.  They don't stand for anything.  And not only that, there should be some kind of crisis, right, that's resolved.  But the crisis that there is only crises that come about because they're so shallow and  uninteresting and boring and unprincipled, why is this here?  And why would this be in front of this horrible story that comes right after?  Well, it began to dawn on me, and it's dawned on other people.  I'm not the only one who knows this or understands this, please.  There's no judges here, isn't this interesting?  Every other part of the book is about God's salvation, and what the author is showing us,  and therefore what God's showing us, is what we look like without a salvation, what we  look like without Him, what we are in our natural state.  In other words, this is showing us the nature of sin.  And this right away actually shows us some things that are very, very surprising to us.  If you live in this society, you've got some, how do I say stereotypes about what you  think the Bible teaches about sin and about evil.  And this goes right against it.  Look, real briefly, because we're going to the Lord's table today, and we're going  to have a series.  Look, real briefly, let me show you.  This tells us what sin does to us, what sin does to God, and how we can be cured of it.  What sin does to us, what sin does to God, and how we can be cured of it.  And every one of them is surprising.  The first one, what sin does to us.  What do you think sin really does to you in its advanced stages?  What does sin really do to the human heart?  What does it do to the character?  Most of us believe that most of us are kind of regular people.  Of course, we sin, of course, to air is sin and to air is human and so on.  But when we think of people who are really diabolical, really, really advanced in their  evil, we think of evil geniuses.  We think of the people in all of the action films as terrible, those charming, those witty,  but those diabolical, those cruel.  That's not at all what the Bible says.  When Hana Arant went to the trial of Adolf Heichmann, the Nazi butcher, she was shocked  by what she found.  And she wrote an essay that really got a lot of flak.  She wrote an essay on what she called the banality of evil.  Now banal is a word that basically means common.  It means run of the mill.  And she looked at this guy and she says, anybody could have done this must be a monster,  but when she saw him, she realizes this isn't a monster.  First of all, she found he was a boring little man.  He spoke in clichés, no insights, really very little sense of humor.  And he had the absolute run of the mill, like all the rest of us, desire to be important,  desire to be liked, ability to kind of, you know, not think about things that are unpleasant.  And she wrote and she said, he wasn't a monster, he was just like all the rest of us.  He was boring and superficial, and uninteresting, and shallow.  And people got very upset with her.  And they said, you can't say that, anybody can do this, this man, anybody can do this  cannot be like us.  And Hannah aren't got it partly right, but partly wrong, at least according to the Bible.  Because she said, because he was so banal and superficial, it led him to do evil.  But the Bible says it's evil that leads you to be banal.  The most advanced, the most prominent, the most characteristic, effective sin on the human  heart is not to make us bad but boring.  There's nobody that said it better than C.S. Lewis, of course, and actually I've got  a number of his quotes that helped me with this sermon.  He says, I am really upset with the most pernicious of all the literary images of evil.  It's Gert is Mephistopheles in Faust.  The humorous, civilized Mephistopheles strengthens the illusion that evil is liberating.  But the real mark of hell is a sleepless, unsmiling concentration upon the self.  You must understand hell as a place where everyone is perpetually concerned about his or  her own dignity and advancement, where everybody always has a grievance, and where everybody  lives in the deadly seriousness of envy and self-importance.  Here's another section, in preface to Paradise Lost Lewis as this, to admire Satanist  to give one's vote for a world of lies, propaganda, and incessant autobiography.  At the choice as possible, hardly a day passes without some slight movement toward it in  every one of us.  Sin in each of us is something that once just to be petted and admired, to take advantage  of other lives.  It especially wants to be left to itself.  It wants to keep well away from anything better or stronger higher than it.  Anything that would make it feel small, but unimpeded, sin will exploit the whole universe  if it could.  Now, here's what Lewis is saying.  Here's what Hannah Arnt saw at least partially.  Here's what we're being told.  Why in the world would this be considered, a case study of human beings without God?  Why not something more awful?  Why not something more cruel?  Why not something more like the last part of the book?  What is this about?  And the answer is what Lewis says.  The most interesting, advanced sin makes you boring because all you're ever worried about  is how you're doing, how you look, how things are affecting you.  There's always agreements incessant autobiography.  You can never get out of yourself.  You're always feeling sorry for yourself.  And you know what's so weird about this.  You say, ah, that's not like Jack Nicholson is the Joker in Batman.  I mean, there's evil.  You know, no.  Sin makes you mediocre.  The most advanced sin makes there's nothing more boring than somebody's always worried  about how you look.  Sin makes you these very uninteresting, unprincipled, shallow, boring people.  It's pretty interesting.  There's an article called the Culture Zone Column in the New York Times Magazine today  about the tremendous popularity of one, you know, one-person shows.  Have you seen that?  Or they just get up and they stand up there and they talk about their lives and they talk  about their stories and they talk about everything, one-person shows.  And virtually everybody knows it's sort of an open secret even though it keeps going  that the vast majority of people are just boring.  The vast majority of people, those one-person shows, tell you way too much.  This is what the line says in the article, way too much about people that you have no desire  to know.  Why are people so uninteresting when they just simply talk?  They're not part of a story when they just say, here's how I feel.  Here's what's on my mind.  It's sleepless, unsmiling concentration on the self.  That's the essence of sin.  And the first thing we see here is that what sin really does is not make you bad before  it makes you boring.  That's the primary thing, incessant autobiography.  But that's the first surprising thing.  But the second surprising thing is, like, in a way more seminal.  It's in the Bible when sin ruins you.  It's because already your attitude toward yourself is always based on your attitude toward  God.  Your understanding of yourself is always based on your understanding of God.  Your emotions toward yourself are always based on your emotions toward God.  Because what we have here is just as surprising.  It tells us what sin leads us to do toward God.  What does sin lead us to do?  How does sin lead us to regard God?  Now, again, most people would think that advance sin would make you an atheist.  That's advanced.  We have a lot of those advanced sinners right around New York City, actually a pretty  surprising number.  High percentage that don't want any other city in the country.  People say, I don't believe in God.  And maybe you're one of those.  I don't know.  You know, somebody brought you here out of curiosity.  Maybe you're one of those.  Well, I got good news for you.  Atheism is not the essence of sin at all.  Here's what we're told.  Says, I dedicate to the Lord these two images.  Boy, that's terrible.  Doesn't she know what the 10 commandments says, the first commandment?  They'll shout, not worship any other gods.  Doesn't the first commandment say, I should have no other gods before me?  Why is she making those idols?  Doesn't she know?  Why would she worship other gods right there in front of God, right in his shrine, you see?  And the answer is, she's not worshiping other gods.  Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache.  We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives.  How did it get this way?  And what can be done about it?  In his brand new book that's releasing this month, what is wrong with the world?  Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer.  Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer, Dr. Keller shows how the reality  of sin explains the pain we see all around us  and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing.  Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes  or choices, or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world will help you see  how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us.  This newly released book, What Is Wrong with the World, is our thanks for your gift this  month to help gospel in life share the good news of Jesus.

Listen, there's plenty of gods named in the book of Judges.  The Canaanites had the bales and the asterisks and the Philistines had dagon and the Syrians had  Rimon and the Mowbites had Kimosh, but she doesn't say I'm going to make an Isle of Kimosh,  she didn't make a bale, she didn't make an asterisks, she didn't make a Kimosh, she  had a dagon of Rimon.  What did she make?  Who are these images of?  Well, they're the ones in whose name they're dedicated.  These are images of God, these are images of the Lord God, these are images of Yahweh  the God of Israel.  What she has done is not she hasn't, she hasn't worshipped another God and she's not worshiping  no God, she's worshipping a reduced God.  She has whittled God down, she has made him, she has put a handle on him.  This is a God you can put in your purse.  This is a God you can take places with you.  This is a God who's manageable, this is a God who's tame and this is the heart of sin.  A little God, a manageable tamed God will make you a little manageable, controllable  person.  Is it?  Han Ahren said the scary thing was that banal person was capable of unbelievable terror  and evil under certain circumstances.  And the point at the end of the book of Judges is banal people caused by sin, sleepless  un, sleepless concentration on the self, unsmiling, humorless, therefore boring.  Incessant autobiography makes you feel so sorry for yourself that you are capable of  terrible things eventually.  All of our problems come in essence from whittling God down, Psalm 50 verse 21 talks  about it, when God looks at the people and he doesn't say you've rejected me, he doesn't  even say you're worshiping other gods, what does he say?  He says you thought this is songs 50 verse 21, you thought I was like yourself.  And this is the essence of sin.  We are sure God has got to be like us.  We're going to whittle them down to our size, let me give you some examples of how we  do it.  The only few, Kathy said please keep it at about 30 because we were sitting and talking  about him.  I began to realize, well this is the essence, look number one, first of all we think  God's like us and we think he can be bought.  Some of you have started coming to church, started reading your Bible, started cleaning up  your life because you say I need strength, I need inspiration, stop it.  Well, wait a minute, shouldn't I read my Bible, shouldn't I pray?  Should I live a good life, shouldn't I come to church, isn't that what God wants?  Well, he said all depends on why you're doing it because here's what I'm afraid, almost  always the way we, when we move toward God, our hearts are filled with this and therefore  we always in the beginning start like this.  We think God can be bought, we think God can be impressed.  And the reason we start cleaning our life up is what?  So we can say, and here's the essence of sin, now God has to be good to me because I'm  doing everything right.  See, Michael was so happy that he knew he was out of compliance with his own son as a  priest.  He realized what the word of God said, but oh, wait a minute, I can get a leave, I'll leave  it.  Now surely God will be good to me, he's obeying, but why is he obeying?  To get control of God, to buy him, highly religious people who are absolutely sure that  God has to be good to you, God has to answer your prayers, God has to bless you, God has  to give you a good life, God has to give you the spouse of your dreams, why?  Because I'm doing everything right.  Now the Lord has to be good to me, what have you done?  You put a handle on God, you're trying to control God, you whittled him down, you think  he's like you, they can be bought, they can be impressed, he can't be.  And by the way, there's nothing they'll make you more boring than making you a smug  self-righteous religious person, nothing, they're the worst kind.  Little God creates little people.  Secondly, we think God's like us because, you know, it can be bought, secondly, you think  God's like you because you don't think he's any wiser than you are.  Do you know why we're so scared so often, why we're so angry because things aren't going  right?  Do you know why so many of you have walked away saying, I cannot believe in a God who  would let this happen and this happen and this happen.  What are you saying?  What are you saying?  What you're saying is because I can't think of a good reason for this to have happened,  there can't be one.  Now, when you say, I can't believe in a God who would let this happen, you simply have  pulled him down, you said, he couldn't be wiser than me, well, not what?  How acidized is that intellectually?  You know, to say, if you believe there's a God big enough to have caused this, then you've  got to believe there's a God who's big enough to have some reason for it bigger than you,  that you wouldn't know.  You can't have it both ways.  You can't be mad at God because you acknowledge He's more powerful than you, but then you will  let Him be more wise than you.  I mean, that's just, and yet we're so bitter in our soul and we're so cast down all the  time.  Why?  Because we just don't believe God.  You believe I'm like you, He says.  You have whittled me down.  You've made me into an image something controllable.  You've revised me.  You've edited me.  You've pulled me down.  You know, Elizabeth Alleya, who often quote, when she, there was a book she wrote years  ago about her husband and a number of other women's husbands were killed in the jungles  of South America as part of their missionary work.  It's called Through the Gates of Splendor, and many years later, it was reissued in a  kind of silver anniversary edition, and she wrote an epilogue to it, and this is what  she said in it, and it just slammed me.  She says, people asked me, what did you learn from all that?  What did you learn from your husband, the love of your life being killed when you had  a little baby girl and you'd only been married for two years?  What did you learn?  And this is what she said.  I have reflected on all that happened to me, and one thing, one thing is pointed out, quote,  if he is God, he is worthy of my worship and my service, and I will find rest nowhere,  but in his will, and that will is infinitely immeasurably, unspeakably beyond my largest  notion of what he is up to.  The one thing I learned is if he's God, I will find no rest anywhere but in his will,  and that's true of everybody in the face of this earth.  They'll never be freedom in your heart unless you are willing to admit that his will is  infinitely immeasurably, unspeakably beyond my largest notion of what he's up to.  Let me give you a couple more.  We think he's like us in math, in other words, we think he can be bought.  Secondly, we think he is like us in his wisdom, therefore, we can't think of something.  If we get no worries up to them, he can't be up to anything good.  Thirdly, we think he's like us in our scale.  Scale, I got this from Kathy late last night.  She's been reading the series in the New York Times Science section on what we're  learning about the galaxies.  Now listen, you know this, you know, stuff like this.  The distance from the earth to the sun, 93 million miles, was reduced to the thickness  of a piece of paper.  Then the diameter of just this galaxy would be a stack of paper, 310 miles high.  And our galaxy is just one of gazillions and gazillions of galaxies just in our cluster.  Our galaxy relates just to the cluster of galaxies.  The way a single grain of sand would relate to all the beaches on the entire and all the  sand and all the coasts of Florida, that's how many galaxies there are.  And that's just in our cluster.  And even from the moon, you can't see us, we're going to expect from the moon.  And yet the Bible says that if there is a God, think about this, he holds the world together.  He holds it all up with the word of his power.  The entire universe is like a contact lens on his little finger.  Now, do you say to somebody like that, please come into my life to be my assistant?  Do you say to somebody like that, don't call us, we'll call you?  Do you say something like that?  Well yeah, I might deal with you after I've had a little fun.  I've moved to New York City after all.  Do you say, well, I'll be happy to believe in you if you give me a complete explanation  for all of my questions.  You've forgotten the scale.  You think I'm like, you are da, you know, the audacity of it, give you another one.  You know racism is, racism is, it's taking cultural differences and I'm viewing them with  moral significance.  Let's just say, listen, white racism isn't the only kind of racism, but it's pretty prominent.  So let me pick on us white people, all right, for a second.  Okay, what do white people do?  They, especially what do northern European types do, you know, us with the background,  you know, British or German and all that.  We see these ethnic groups and they're much more emotional.  So when they're happy, they're more emotional and when they're sad, they're more emotional.  What do you feel when you see that?  You say, this sort of lost it haven't they kind of, you know, they're different, but you  deepen your heart, have assigned moral superiority to your difference and moral inferiority  to their difference.  And they're going to do the same thing.  I know that, but here's the point.  What is white racism?  It's saying, my God is white.  My God is like me.  God is white.  That's exactly what Psalm 50 verse 21, you thought I was like, you, everything comes from  that.  All of our doubts, all of our anger, you see, all of our self-righteousness.  I'll give you another one, you think God is like you in his attitude toward time.  You know, when God sees time, he sees it all at once.  If you were high up over the earth, he would look down at the Mississippi River and all parts  of the Mississippi River would be equally visible, right?  If you're down on the Mississippi River, you only see your bend.  Now, a lot of you are saying, oh, years ago, yes, I did this and yes, I did this and yes,  I did these things, but you know, they were bad, but you know, I've gotten over it.  Certainly God wouldn't hold that against me.  My friends, God's attitude toward God is the very, the thing you remember way in the past,  he is seeing now.  He's still happening right in his nostrils.  This is the reason why God has got of justice.  This is the reason why God never gets over anything.  This is the reason why there has to be atonement, there has to be punishment.  And when you say, well, you know, why, I can't believe in a God who judges, you think he's  like you.  You think that because of the terrible things you've done and at the time you felt dog  on guilty and it hurt a lot of people, but now it's been a year, it's been two years,  it's been ten years, it doesn't bother you anymore.  We thought I was like you.  All of our problems come from this.  Because God, our God has become little, we've made him little, we've made him manageable,  we get rid of the things that we don't like.  Oh, I can't believe in this anymore, I can't believe in that anymore.  We've whittled him down as a result.  We've been whittled up, there's no greatness to us, there's no freedom.  Do you realize if you really accepted the God that Elizabeth always talking about, a God  who is infinite, his will is infinitely and measurably beyond anything you can ever, any  notion of what he's up to?  If you said, I accept that, I embrace that, you'd be free, totally free, nothing can bother  you anymore.  If you said, I'm not trying to obey God so He'll be good to me, so He'll give me the things  I want, so He'll give me the status, He'll give me the marriage, so He'll give me the things  I want.  Instead, if you said, but He said, not I'm going to use Him to get the things that give me  meaning in life, but that He is my meaning in life.  If you really made Him your meaning in life, if He was the ultimate instead of just a little  means to an end, something you've learned how to handle in order to get what you want.  If He was your meaning in life, in other words, if He was big, you'd be big.  If He was great in your eyes, you'd be a great heart.  You would walk through life greatly, you wouldn't be scared and upset and circumstances beating  you around all the time.  This is the reason why there's this one little place in the Narnia Chronicles, those fairy  tales by C.S. Lewis.  It goes by so fast that you just don't even notice its significance, but it's so incredibly  interesting.  It's where little Lucy meets Aslan, who's Jesus.  He's a lion, and she meets him in the second book, and she says, Aslan, at last, welcome  child.  He says, Aslan said, Lucy, you're bigger.  That's because you're older, little child.  Not because you're bigger?  No.  The bigger you get, the more you grow, the more you'll find me bigger.  Now, what does He say?  It goes by so fast, you don't even stop and think about it, Pilates.  Lewis is saying, the bigger your God is, the bigger you will be.  The more you let God be God, the more you make Him not a means to an end but the end.  Not someone has to answer your questions.  The more you put Him on His proper scale, the more of a great heart you will be.  Well, how?  How is it possible?  How in the world?  And you know what?  The normal thing for Christian to do, and I'll tell you, over the years, I used to end  my sermons here.  I used to say, now what?  I know.  I've got sermons like this from the past.  I've been looking at them over the last couple of weeks.  I would say study the attributes of God.  Think of His holiness.  Think of His majesty.  Think of His wisdom.  Don't whittle them down.  Except everything the Bible says about it.  What is this commandment where He says, do not make a graven image of me, He says.  And what He's saying is, don't imagine me to be what you want me to be but worship me  as I am.  So what does it mean?  Except what He says.  But you know what?  When I study, when I just study His holiness, when I just study His majesty, when I just  study His wisdom, I don't feel, I'm not getting greater, I'm not getting bigger.  It just starts to crush me and it'll crush you.  This thing that has on saying to Lucy, I don't sense that dynamic at all, it just makes  me feel worse and worse and worse.  It's like, oh my word, this is God but I'm going to have to just put up with it.  But the answer is this, in verse 6, it says, the reason for all this was there was no  king.  Do you see that?  It says, the reason all this idiotic, idiocy, the reason all this smallness in those days  Israel had no king.  Now what is the author saying?  He says, there's no savior.  We need something better than these judges.  We need a king.  But when you get to the king, even the best king, David, we see that he needed a savior.  And what we're being pointed to is simply this.  Why is it that God said no image?  Why is it that Israel was the only religion on the face of the earth at that time?  It's the first religion, almost invented it.  That if you went into this temple, you went into the holy of Holies, into the inner sanctum,  and you even went to the ark of the covenant, which is the throne of God.  There was the cherubim, the angels, facing inward, and right where you expect to see an  image, something palpable, something you could grab hold on, something accessible, right?  We're physical beings, we have, we have, we taste touch here, see smell, we have senses  and we want to see something, we want to feel something.  And right there, there's nothing.  God says, don't you, they're putting an image there.  My throne is empty.  Can you say how my word is that it?  We have to put up with an abstract invisible God, a God we can't touch, God we can't see  here, or smell, and God says, no, no, no, no, don't you dare put an image there, but not  because there never will be one.  In Colossians chapter 1, verse 15, we read something amazing, he is the image, Jesus Christ,  is the image of the invisible God, for by him all created, all things were created, whether  the thrones or powers or rulers or authorities.  Now here's what God is saying, God is saying, I understand why you want an image.  I understand why you want something you can grab hold on, and I will give you something.  I will supply the image, don't you supply the image because any image you try to make  me, make of me, to make me something you can relate to will only make me tinier and  smaller and it will make you smaller.  But I will give you the true image, a living image, the Lord Jesus Christ, and he will  so reveal my glory that on the one hand he will be someone you finally can relate to  a human being a person, someone who loves and who weeps and who embraces, finally someone  who is successful but somebody who actually makes me in your mind greater than you could  imagine.  Not smaller but greater, why?  Because this great God, you know, before whom we are nothing but specks, we are nothing but  specks of dust, we are nothing but paramecium, we are nothing but amoebas.  No other image could possibly have told us what this image does and that is he came to  die for us, he died for the paramecium, he died for the amoebas.  When you have a God that is so big that he could become small, you got a bigger God than  you could have imagined.  No other religion has such a God, no other religion admits that God is so big he could have  become small.  Only when you have a God like that, only when you admit that Jesus Christ is the image  of God that he died for me, that is what finally shows me a greatness beyond anything I would  know otherwise but it is not a greatness that crushes me.  Now I want to live for him.  Now I don't say, now God has got to be good to me because I am obeying all the rules because  Jesus is my goodness.  He is the thing.  I would want more than that, he is my meaning in life now.  You see God can't be bought but we can.  The bigger he gets, the bigger we will get.  Let's pray.  Father, we know that one of the reasons for the Lord's supper is it is something physical.  It is something we can put in our hands and it reminds us that you have put Jesus Christ  on the earth to be our image, image of you, our way of understanding your greatness.  It is only as we receive him, as we remember what he has done, that you finally take in our  minds your proper proportions and when that happens we will be so free.  We pray, Lord, that you will make yourself real to us and your proper proportions as we  take the Lord's supper as we take the bread and the cup.  Be yourself in our eyes, be yourself in our hearts, be yourself so we can finally be ourselves.  What you have made us to be in Jesus' name we pray, amen.

### 中文翻译

欢迎来到《福音人生》。破坏是什么意思？在这个信息中，蒂姆·凯勒探讨了罪如何使我们成为破坏者，以及改变如何来自基督。

破坏是什么意思？破坏是损坏他人不属于我们的财产。破坏是在他人的东西上留下你的痕迹。破坏是缺乏对他人或他人的东西的尊重。

在精神层面上，破坏更广泛。精神破坏是当一个人不尊重他人时。精神破坏是当一个人通过言语或行为破坏他人时。精神破坏是当一个人对他人造成伤害时。

圣经说这就是罪对我们所做的。罪使我们成为精神破坏者。

现在，为什么会这样？因为当我们被罪所驱动时，当我们追逐自己的欲望时，我们不在乎他人。我们只在乎自己。所以我们破坏。

现在，这如何改变？通过基督。当我们相信基督时，当我们被爱改变时，我们停止破坏。我们开始尊重。我们开始建设。
