## English Transcript / 英文原文

today's teaching, Tim Keller looks at how the Bible's teaching on sin gives us a deeply  honest and yet incredibly hopeful view of the world. Turn to a part of your bulletin where you have the passage on which the Scripture  is based, and we're starting this week a new series, and it's on sin and there's nothing  more fundamentally relevant and practical than to understand the answer to the fundamental  human question, what's wrong with us? If you're trying to raise a family or run a corporation or if you have political or community  involvement and if anything you do in this life, you need to have a working theory of  an answer to that question, what's wrong with us? Why the selfishness, the cruelty, the corruption, the crime, the racism, the injustice? Why?

Where does it come from? Now the Bible's answer is ancient and it's profound and that is sin in the human heart. One of the reasons why it's so widely rejected, I believe, is actually because what's not  understood is that the biblical understanding and doctrine of sin is multidimensional. All of us understand or remember, I think they understand what the Bible says about sin. We say yes, we know what the Bible says about sin.

Sin is breaking God's law and therefore we're guilty and condemned, yes, I know what the  Bible says, but that's only one. In fact, that's the last of the aspects of sin that we're going to look at in this series. I think one of the reasons why sin as an answer to the reason to the problems of our life  is tends to be widely overlooked by people is because we don't understand the multidimensionality  than how nuanced, how rich, see, how multi-perspectival the biblical teaching on sin is. We're going to look at the first of those dimensions today and we're going to read a  passage of scripture that I can almost proudly say, it's very possible and very likely that  even if you've gone to church all of your life, you've never heard anybody so stupid as  to try to preach a sermon on this text. This text is almost never preached on, I've never preached on, it's almost never studied.

It's the end of the book of Judges and one of the reasons why nobody knows what to do  with it, why it's there and so but nobody ever tries to speak about it is because it is  so inexplicably boring. Judges 17 versus 1 to 13, it's just the beginning of a story and I'll tell you how it ends. You don't need to know. Now a man named Micah from the hill country of Ephraim said to his mother,  you know the 1100 chequels of silver that were taken from you and about which I heard  you order a curse? I have that silver with me.

I took it. And then his mother said, the Lord bless you my son and when he returned the 1100 chequels  of silver to his mother she said, I solemnly consecrate my silver to the Lord for my son  to make a carved image and a cast idol. I will give it back to you, O Lord see. So he returned the silver to his mother and she took 200 chequels of silver and gave  them to a silversmith who made them into the image and the idol and they were put in  Micah's house. Now this man Micah had a shrine and he made an effort and some idols and installed one  of his sons as his priest.

In those days Israel had no king. Everyone did as he saw fit a young Levite from Bethlehem and Judah who had been living  within the clan of Judah left that town in search of some other place to stay and on  his way he came to Micah's house in the hill country of Ephraim and Micah asked him,  where are you from? Oh I'm a Levite from Bethlehem and Judah he asked he said, and I'm looking for a place  to stay then Micah said to him, live with me and be my father and priest and I'll give  you 10 chequels of silver a year your clothes and your food. So the Levite agreed to live with him and the young man was to him like one of his sons  and then Micah installed a Levite and the young man became his priest and lived in his  house and Micah said, now I know that the Lord will be good to me since this Levite has  become my priest. Now let me tell you what we have here.

One of the reasons why people ignore this section or really find it kind of confusing  is this, up to now everything in the book of Judges has been extremely interesting. Book of Judges is a history of Israel after they came into Canaan, they had been led there  by Moses and Joshua out of Egypt and they came into Canaan and what we have in the book  of Judges the first 16 chapters is a series of fascinating stories because over and over  the people would slide into sin and when they slide into sin they soon became enslaved  by some foreign power and then over and over again 12 times actually in the book God sends  a judge which is really a deliverer. You mustn't think in terms of a magistrate or someone sitting at a bench. A judge was a deliverer, essentially a savior and the judge would come and turn the people  bet away from sin back to God and liberate them from the military oppressors and it was  always fascinating. I'm very dramatic and some of the most famous people.

We have Gideon here, we have Deborah here, we have Samson in this book and it's always thrilling  and exciting to see the salvation come, they're saved you see. But then when you get to chapter 17 to chapter 21 there's these last five chapters and  they're very, very hard to understand because they don't seem to be about anything. There's no judges in here, there's no salvation that comes, God hardly shows up in some ways. And what's so intriguing is that there's two incidents. In chapter 17 and 18 we have one and you've read half of it and in chapter 19 to 21 you  have the other and the first one we've already read and what do we see here?

Well first of all we see three, if you're going to give this story a title and it couldn't  be a very interesting title because it's not a very interesting story, it's a bunch of  trivial people doing kind of dumb, weird things. I could call it Micah, Mom and the Levite. And what you have is you have these three people, first all you have Micah, cheating his mother. And then giving her the money back when she hears him, idling a curse against the robber  whoever it is and he says, well you know I'm, I did it, I robbed and I was kind of scared  when he's, you know he's not very good or very bad, I mean how good can you be to rob  your own mother but then how bad could you be to get, you know give it back, you know kind  of, gee I'm scared, you cursed, I wonder. And then so you see Micah, cheating his mother, then you see his mother cheating God because  if you notice when she's really excited she says I will give it all back to the Lord.

I'm so happy about this, I'm so happy my son came back and did all, he says I solemnly  constrict my silver, all I give it back but when she actually came to it she only used  200 checkers and she makes two images, two idols out of silver and puts them in in a sense  her son's chapel where he worshiped the Lord. In complete contradiction to everything God says anywhere, right in the tank of maim,  it's all through the law of Moses where he says you mustn't make images, you mustn't  make idols. So first we have Micah cheating mom, then we have mom cheating God and then along comes  the Levite. And on what's his point? Well Micah and his mother decided they were going to have their own shrine.

See in those days there was a tabernacle, a sanctuary, a place where God said worship  me here and it was at Shiloh. And in that tabernacle there was an effort that was the breastplate of a priest, that the  priest wore and had stones on there through which God spoke to people. There was an effort and there was a priest and the priest had to be Levites, they had to  be on the tribe of Levi. And there was a sanctuary where people could come and pray and worship. But Micah and mom, they wanted to have their own sanctuary, they wanted to have their own  place of worship.

And so they made one of their sons, mom's grandson, Micah's son, a priest until along comes  the Levite and Micah says, wow, I can have a genuine Levite here, just like in the law  of Moses. So he says how much would you know be willing to work for this amount and Levites says, sure,  fine. And so now he says, boy, now I've really got a Levite, I've got an effort, I've got everything  I want. Except in chapter 18, and this is how the story ends, a group of men come along, Danites,  they're trying to find a new place to live. And they say to the Levite, you come with me, come with us, we'll pay you more.

And bring those images along, which, of course, were worth quite a bit of money. And so Micah comes running out saying, you stole my Levite, you stole my images, what are  you doing in the Danites? I'd say, go home or I might hurt you. And so he did. And that's how the story ends.

And then in chapter 19 to 21, suddenly, at the very end of the book of Judges, we're completely  unprepared. After all these boring people doing all these trivial things, we're completely unprepared  for what happens. There's a gang rape of a woman that leads to not just civil war between the tribes of Israel,  but genocidal destruction of whole towns and villages down to the infants. And what's so strange about this, again, no judges, no salvation, no nothing, now what's  going on here. Now, on the one hand, this is terrible storytelling.

Now when I say terrible storytelling, I don't mean I think this was just made up, but you  see this incident was chosen out of this whole period of history. Why? Why was it chosen? When I say it's a bad story, first of all, in a good story, you have to somebody, some  character, who you get engaged with, that you care about, you have to have some character  that you're concerned about, otherwise it's just a terrible narrative. And nobody here you care about, see, they're all, none of them are very good or very bad.

They're very shallow. They're very uninteresting. They're boring, they're very unprincipled. They don't stand for anything. And not only that, there should be some kind of crisis, right, that's resolved.

But the crisis that there is only crises that come about because they're so shallow and  uninteresting and boring and unprincipled, why is this here? And why would this be in front of this horrible story that comes right after? Well, it began to dawn on me, and it's dawned on other people. I'm not the only one who knows this or understands this, please. There's no judges here, isn't this interesting?

Every other part of the book is about God's salvation, and what the author is showing us,  and therefore what God's showing us, is what we look like without a salvation, what we  look like without Him, what we are in our natural state. In other words, this is showing us the nature of sin. And this right away actually shows us some things that are very, very surprising to us. If you live in this society, you've got some, how do I say stereotypes about what you  think the Bible teaches about sin and about evil. And this goes right against it.

Look, real briefly, because we're going to the Lord's table today, and we're going  to have a series. Look, real briefly, let me show you. This tells us what sin does to us, what sin does to God, and how we can be cured of it. What sin does to us, what sin does to God, and how we can be cured of it. And every one of them is surprising.

The first one, what sin does to us. What do you think sin really does to you in its advanced stages? What does sin really do to the human heart? What does it do to the character? Most of us believe that most of us are kind of regular people.

Of course, we sin, of course, to air is sin and to air is human and so on. But when we think of people who are really diabolical, really, really advanced in their  evil, we think of evil geniuses. We think of the people in all of the action films as terrible, those charming, those witty,  but those diabolical, those cruel. That's not at all what the Bible says. When Hana Arant went to the trial of Adolf Heichmann, the Nazi butcher, she was shocked  by what she found.

And she wrote an essay that really got a lot of flak. She wrote an essay on what she called the banality of evil. Now banal is a word that basically means common. It means run of the mill. And she looked at this guy and she says, anybody could have done this must be a monster,  but when she saw him, she realizes this isn't a monster.

First of all, she found he was a boring little man. He spoke in clichés, no insights, really very little sense of humor. And he had the absolute run of the mill, like all the rest of us, desire to be important,  desire to be liked, ability to kind of, you know, not think about things that are unpleasant. And she wrote and she said, he wasn't a monster, he was just like all the rest of us. He was boring and superficial, and uninteresting, and shallow.

And people got very upset with her. And they said, you can't say that, anybody can do this, this man, anybody can do this  cannot be like us. And Hannah aren't got it partly right, but partly wrong, at least according to the Bible. Because she said, because he was so banal and superficial, it led him to do evil. But the Bible says it's evil that leads you to be banal.

The most advanced, the most prominent, the most characteristic, effective sin on the human  heart is not to make us bad but boring. There's nobody that said it better than C.S. Lewis, of course, and actually I've got  a number of his quotes that helped me with this sermon. He says, I am really upset with the most pernicious of all the literary images of evil. It's Gert is Mephistopheles in Faust.

The humorous, civilized Mephistopheles strengthens the illusion that evil is liberating. But the real mark of hell is a sleepless, unsmiling concentration upon the self. You must understand hell as a place where everyone is perpetually concerned about his or  her own dignity and advancement, where everybody always has a grievance, and where everybody  lives in the deadly seriousness of envy and self-importance. Here's another section, in preface to Paradise Lost Lewis as this, to admire Satanist  to give one's vote for a world of lies, propaganda, and incessant autobiography. At the choice as possible, hardly a day passes without some slight movement toward it in  every one of us.

Sin in each of us is something that once just to be petted and admired, to take advantage  of other lives. It especially wants to be left to itself. It wants to keep well away from anything better or stronger higher than it. Anything that would make it feel small, but unimpeded, sin will exploit the whole universe  if it could. Now, here's what Lewis is saying.

Here's what Hannah Arnt saw at least partially. Here's what we're being told. Why in the world would this be considered, a case study of human beings without God? Why not something more awful? Why not something more cruel?

Why not something more like the last part of the book? What is this about? And the answer is what Lewis says. The most interesting, advanced sin makes you boring because all you're ever worried about  is how you're doing, how you look, how things are affecting you. There's always agreements incessant autobiography.

You can never get out of yourself. You're always feeling sorry for yourself. And you know what's so weird about this. You say, ah, that's not like Jack Nicholson is the Joker in Batman. I mean, there's evil.

You know, no. Sin makes you mediocre. The most advanced sin makes there's nothing more boring than somebody's always worried  about how you look. Sin makes you these very uninteresting, unprincipled, shallow, boring people. It's pretty interesting.

There's an article called the Culture Zone Column in the New York Times Magazine today  about the tremendous popularity of one, you know, one-person shows. Have you seen that? Or they just get up and they stand up there and they talk about their lives and they talk  about their stories and they talk about everything, one-person shows. And virtually everybody knows it's sort of an open secret even though it keeps going  that the vast majority of people are just boring. The vast majority of people, those one-person shows, tell you way too much.

This is what the line says in the article, way too much about people that you have no desire  to know. Why are people so uninteresting when they just simply talk? They're not part of a story when they just say, here's how I feel. Here's what's on my mind. It's sleepless, unsmiling concentration on the self.

That's the essence of sin. And the first thing we see here is that what sin really does is not make you bad before  it makes you boring. That's the primary thing, incessant autobiography. But that's the first surprising thing. But the second surprising thing is, like, in a way more seminal.

It's in the Bible when sin ruins you. It's because already your attitude toward yourself is always based on your attitude toward  God. Your understanding of yourself is always based on your understanding of God. Your emotions toward yourself are always based on your emotions toward God. Because what we have here is just as surprising.

It tells us what sin leads us to do toward God. What does sin lead us to do? How does sin lead us to regard God? Now, again, most people would think that advance sin would make you an atheist. That's advanced.

We have a lot of those advanced sinners right around New York City, actually a pretty  surprising number. High percentage that don't want any other city in the country. People say, I don't believe in God. And maybe you're one of those. I don't know.

You know, somebody brought you here out of curiosity. Maybe you're one of those. Well, I got good news for you. Atheism is not the essence of sin at all. Here's what we're told.

Says, I dedicate to the Lord these two images. Boy, that's terrible. Doesn't she know what the 10 commandments says, the first commandment? They'll shout, not worship any other gods. Doesn't the first commandment say, I should have no other gods before me?

Why is she making those idols? Doesn't she know? Why would she worship other gods right there in front of God, right in his shrine, you see? And the answer is, she's not worshiping other gods. Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache.

We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way? And what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing this month, what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer.

Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer, Dr. Keller shows how the reality  of sin explains the pain we see all around us  and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes  or choices, or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world will help you see  how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us.

Listen, there's plenty of gods named in the book of Judges. The Canaanites had the bales and the asterisks and the Philistines had dagon and the Syrians had  Rimon and the Mowbites had Kimosh, but she doesn't say I'm going to make an Isle of Kimosh,  she didn't make a bale, she didn't make an asterisks, she didn't make a Kimosh, she  had a dagon of Rimon. What did she make? Who are these images of? Well, they're the ones in whose name they're dedicated.

These are images of God, these are images of the Lord God, these are images of Yahweh  the God of Israel. What she has done is not she hasn't, she hasn't worshipped another God and she's not worshiping  no God, she's worshipping a reduced God. She has whittled God down, she has made him, she has put a handle on him. This is a God you can put in your purse. This is a God you can take places with you.

This is a God who's manageable, this is a God who's tame and this is the heart of sin. A little God, a manageable tamed God will make you a little manageable, controllable  person. Is it? Han Ahren said the scary thing was that banal person was capable of unbelievable terror  and evil under certain circumstances. And the point at the end of the book of Judges is banal people caused by sin, sleepless  un, sleepless concentration on the self, unsmiling, humorless, therefore boring.

Incessant autobiography makes you feel so sorry for yourself that you are capable of  terrible things eventually. All of our problems come in essence from whittling God down, Psalm 50 verse 21 talks  about it, when God looks at the people and he doesn't say you've rejected me, he doesn't  even say you're worshiping other gods, what does he say? He says you thought this is songs 50 verse 21, you thought I was like yourself. And this is the essence of sin. We are sure God has got to be like us.

We're going to whittle them down to our size, let me give you some examples of how we  do it. The only few, Kathy said please keep it at about 30 because we were sitting and talking  about him. I began to realize, well this is the essence, look number one, first of all we think  God's like us and we think he can be bought. Some of you have started coming to church, started reading your Bible, started cleaning up  your life because you say I need strength, I need inspiration, stop it. Well, wait a minute, shouldn't I read my Bible, shouldn't I pray?

Should I live a good life, shouldn't I come to church, isn't that what God wants? Well, he said all depends on why you're doing it because here's what I'm afraid, almost  always the way we, when we move toward God, our hearts are filled with this and therefore  we always in the beginning start like this. We think God can be bought, we think God can be impressed. And the reason we start cleaning our life up is what? So we can say, and here's the essence of sin, now God has to be good to me because I'm  doing everything right.

See, Michael was so happy that he knew he was out of compliance with his own son as a  priest. He realized what the word of God said, but oh, wait a minute, I can get a leave, I'll leave  it. Now surely God will be good to me, he's obeying, but why is he obeying? To get control of God, to buy him, highly religious people who are absolutely sure that  God has to be good to you, God has to answer your prayers, God has to bless you, God has  to give you a good life, God has to give you the spouse of your dreams, why? Because I'm doing everything right.

Now the Lord has to be good to me, what have you done? You put a handle on God, you're trying to control God, you whittled him down, you think  he's like you, they can be bought, they can be impressed, he can't be. And by the way, there's nothing they'll make you more boring than making you a smug  self-righteous religious person, nothing, they're the worst kind. Little God creates little people. Secondly, we think God's like us because, you know, it can be bought, secondly, you think  God's like you because you don't think he's any wiser than you are.

Do you know why we're so scared so often, why we're so angry because things aren't going  right? Do you know why so many of you have walked away saying, I cannot believe in a God who  would let this happen and this happen and this happen. What are you saying? What are you saying? What you're saying is because I can't think of a good reason for this to have happened,  there can't be one.

Now, when you say, I can't believe in a God who would let this happen, you simply have  pulled him down, you said, he couldn't be wiser than me, well, not what? How acidized is that intellectually? You know, to say, if you believe there's a God big enough to have caused this, then you've  got to believe there's a God who's big enough to have some reason for it bigger than you,  that you wouldn't know. You can't have it both ways. You can't be mad at God because you acknowledge He's more powerful than you, but then you will  let Him be more wise than you.

I mean, that's just, and yet we're so bitter in our soul and we're so cast down all the  time. Why? Because we just don't believe God. You believe I'm like you, He says. You have whittled me down.

You've made me into an image something controllable. You've revised me. You've edited me. You've pulled me down. You know, Elizabeth Alleya, who often quote, when she, there was a book she wrote years  ago about her husband and a number of other women's husbands were killed in the jungles  of South America as part of their missionary work.

It's called Through the Gates of Splendor, and many years later, it was reissued in a  kind of silver anniversary edition, and she wrote an epilogue to it, and this is what  she said in it, and it just slammed me. She says, people asked me, what did you learn from all that? What did you learn from your husband, the love of your life being killed when you had  a little baby girl and you'd only been married for two years? What did you learn? And this is what she said.

I have reflected on all that happened to me, and one thing, one thing is pointed out, quote,  if he is God, he is worthy of my worship and my service, and I will find rest nowhere,  but in his will, and that will is infinitely immeasurably, unspeakably beyond my largest  notion of what he is up to. The one thing I learned is if he's God, I will find no rest anywhere but in his will,  and that's true of everybody in the face of this earth. They'll never be freedom in your heart unless you are willing to admit that his will is  infinitely immeasurably, unspeakably beyond my largest notion of what he's up to. Let me give you a couple more. We think he's like us in math, in other words, we think he can be bought.

Secondly, we think he is like us in his wisdom, therefore, we can't think of something. If we get no worries up to them, he can't be up to anything good. Thirdly, we think he's like us in our scale. Scale, I got this from Kathy late last night. She's been reading the series in the New York Times Science section on what we're  learning about the galaxies.

Now listen, you know this, you know, stuff like this. The distance from the earth to the sun, 93 million miles, was reduced to the thickness  of a piece of paper. Then the diameter of just this galaxy would be a stack of paper, 310 miles high. And our galaxy is just one of gazillions and gazillions of galaxies just in our cluster. Our galaxy relates just to the cluster of galaxies.

The way a single grain of sand would relate to all the beaches on the entire and all the  sand and all the coasts of Florida, that's how many galaxies there are. And that's just in our cluster. And even from the moon, you can't see us, we're going to expect from the moon. And yet the Bible says that if there is a God, think about this, he holds the world together. He holds it all up with the word of his power.

The entire universe is like a contact lens on his little finger. Now, do you say to somebody like that, please come into my life to be my assistant? Do you say to somebody like that, don't call us, we'll call you? Do you say something like that? Well yeah, I might deal with you after I've had a little fun.

I've moved to New York City after all. Do you say, well, I'll be happy to believe in you if you give me a complete explanation  for all of my questions. You've forgotten the scale. You think I'm like, you are da, you know, the audacity of it, give you another one. You know racism is, racism is, it's taking cultural differences and I'm viewing them with  moral significance.

Let's just say, listen, white racism isn't the only kind of racism, but it's pretty prominent. So let me pick on us white people, all right, for a second. Okay, what do white people do? They, especially what do northern European types do, you know, us with the background,  you know, British or German and all that. We see these ethnic groups and they're much more emotional.

So when they're happy, they're more emotional and when they're sad, they're more emotional. What do you feel when you see that? You say, this sort of lost it haven't they kind of, you know, they're different, but you  deepen your heart, have assigned moral superiority to your difference and moral inferiority  to their difference. And they're going to do the same thing. I know that, but here's the point.

What is white racism? It's saying, my God is white. My God is like me. God is white. That's exactly what Psalm 50 verse 21, you thought I was like, you, everything comes from  that.

All of our doubts, all of our anger, you see, all of our self-righteousness. I'll give you another one, you think God is like you in his attitude toward time. You know, when God sees time, he sees it all at once. If you were high up over the earth, he would look down at the Mississippi River and all parts  of the Mississippi River would be equally visible, right? If you're down on the Mississippi River, you only see your bend.

Now, a lot of you are saying, oh, years ago, yes, I did this and yes, I did this and yes,  I did these things, but you know, they were bad, but you know, I've gotten over it. Certainly God wouldn't hold that against me. My friends, God's attitude toward God is the very, the thing you remember way in the past,  he is seeing now. He's still happening right in his nostrils. This is the reason why God has got of justice.

This is the reason why God never gets over anything. This is the reason why there has to be atonement, there has to be punishment. And when you say, well, you know, why, I can't believe in a God who judges, you think he's  like you. You think that because of the terrible things you've done and at the time you felt dog  on guilty and it hurt a lot of people, but now it's been a year, it's been two years,  it's been ten years, it doesn't bother you anymore. We thought I was like you.

All of our problems come from this. Because God, our God has become little, we've made him little, we've made him manageable,  we get rid of the things that we don't like. Oh, I can't believe in this anymore, I can't believe in that anymore. We've whittled him down as a result. We've been whittled up, there's no greatness to us, there's no freedom.

Do you realize if you really accepted the God that Elizabeth always talking about, a God  who is infinite, his will is infinitely and measurably beyond anything you can ever, any  notion of what he's up to? If you said, I accept that, I embrace that, you'd be free, totally free, nothing can bother  you anymore. If you said, I'm not trying to obey God so He'll be good to me, so He'll give me the things  I want, so He'll give me the status, He'll give me the marriage, so He'll give me the things  I want. Instead, if you said, but He said, not I'm going to use Him to get the things that give me  meaning in life, but that He is my meaning in life. If you really made Him your meaning in life, if He was the ultimate instead of just a little  means to an end, something you've learned how to handle in order to get what you want.

If He was your meaning in life, in other words, if He was big, you'd be big. If He was great in your eyes, you'd be a great heart. You would walk through life greatly, you wouldn't be scared and upset and circumstances beating  you around all the time. This is the reason why there's this one little place in the Narnia Chronicles, those fairy  tales by C.S. Lewis.

It goes by so fast that you just don't even notice its significance, but it's so incredibly  interesting. It's where little Lucy meets Aslan, who's Jesus. He's a lion, and she meets him in the second book, and she says, Aslan, at last, welcome  child. He says, Aslan said, Lucy, you're bigger. That's because you're older, little child.

Not because you're bigger? No. The bigger you get, the more you grow, the more you'll find me bigger. Now, what does He say? It goes by so fast, you don't even stop and think about it, Pilates.

Lewis is saying, the bigger your God is, the bigger you will be. The more you let God be God, the more you make Him not a means to an end but the end. Not someone has to answer your questions. The more you put Him on His proper scale, the more of a great heart you will be. Well, how?

How is it possible? How in the world? And you know what? The normal thing for Christian to do, and I'll tell you, over the years, I used to end  my sermons here. I used to say, now what?

I know. I've got sermons like this from the past. I've been looking at them over the last couple of weeks. I would say study the attributes of God. Think of His holiness.

Think of His majesty. Think of His wisdom. Don't whittle them down. Except everything the Bible says about it. What is this commandment where He says, do not make a graven image of me, He says.

And what He's saying is, don't imagine me to be what you want me to be but worship me  as I am. So what does it mean? Except what He says. But you know what? When I study, when I just study His holiness, when I just study His majesty, when I just  study His wisdom, I don't feel, I'm not getting greater, I'm not getting bigger.

It just starts to crush me and it'll crush you. This thing that has on saying to Lucy, I don't sense that dynamic at all, it just makes  me feel worse and worse and worse. It's like, oh my word, this is God but I'm going to have to just put up with it. But the answer is this, in verse 6, it says, the reason for all this was there was no  king. Do you see that?

It says, the reason all this idiotic, idiocy, the reason all this smallness in those days  Israel had no king. Now what is the author saying? He says, there's no savior. We need something better than these judges. We need a king.

But when you get to the king, even the best king, David, we see that he needed a savior. And what we're being pointed to is simply this. Why is it that God said no image? Why is it that Israel was the only religion on the face of the earth at that time? It's the first religion, almost invented it.

That if you went into this temple, you went into the holy of Holies, into the inner sanctum,  and you even went to the ark of the covenant, which is the throne of God. There was the cherubim, the angels, facing inward, and right where you expect to see an  image, something palpable, something you could grab hold on, something accessible, right? We're physical beings, we have, we have, we taste touch here, see smell, we have senses  and we want to see something, we want to feel something. And right there, there's nothing. God says, don't you, they're putting an image there.

My throne is empty. Can you say how my word is that it? We have to put up with an abstract invisible God, a God we can't touch, God we can't see  here, or smell, and God says, no, no, no, no, don't you dare put an image there, but not  because there never will be one. In Colossians chapter 1, verse 15, we read something amazing, he is the image, Jesus Christ,  is the image of the invisible God, for by him all created, all things were created, whether  the thrones or powers or rulers or authorities. Now here's what God is saying, God is saying, I understand why you want an image.

I understand why you want something you can grab hold on, and I will give you something. I will supply the image, don't you supply the image because any image you try to make  me, make of me, to make me something you can relate to will only make me tinier and  smaller and it will make you smaller. But I will give you the true image, a living image, the Lord Jesus Christ, and he will  so reveal my glory that on the one hand he will be someone you finally can relate to  a human being a person, someone who loves and who weeps and who embraces, finally someone  who is successful but somebody who actually makes me in your mind greater than you could  imagine. Not smaller but greater, why? Because this great God, you know, before whom we are nothing but specks, we are nothing but  specks of dust, we are nothing but paramecium, we are nothing but amoebas.

No other image could possibly have told us what this image does and that is he came to  die for us, he died for the paramecium, he died for the amoebas. When you have a God that is so big that he could become small, you got a bigger God than  you could have imagined. No other religion has such a God, no other religion admits that God is so big he could have  become small. Only when you have a God like that, only when you admit that Jesus Christ is the image  of God that he died for me, that is what finally shows me a greatness beyond anything I would  know otherwise but it is not a greatness that crushes me. Now I want to live for him.

Now I don't say, now God has got to be good to me because I am obeying all the rules because  Jesus is my goodness. He is the thing. I would want more than that, he is my meaning in life now. You see God can't be bought but we can. The bigger he gets, the bigger we will get.

Let's pray. Father, we know that one of the reasons for the Lord's supper is it is something physical. It is something we can put in our hands and it reminds us that you have put Jesus Christ  on the earth to be our image, image of you, our way of understanding your greatness. It is only as we receive him, as we remember what he has done, that you finally take in our  minds your proper proportions and when that happens we will be so free. We pray, Lord, that you will make yourself real to us and your proper proportions as we  take the Lord's supper as we take the bread and the cup.

Be yourself in our eyes, be yourself in our hearts, be yourself so we can finally be ourselves. What you have made us to be in Jesus' name we pray, amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today's teaching, Tim Keller looks at how the Bible's teaching on sin gives us a deeply  honest and yet incredibly hopeful view of the world. Turn to a part of your bulletin where you have the passage on which the Scripture  is based, and we're starting this week a new series, and it's on sin and there's nothing  more fundamentally relevant and practical than to understand the answer to the fundamental  human question, what's wrong with us? If you're trying to raise a family or run a corporation or if you have political or community  involvement and if anything you do in this life, you need to have a working theory of  an answer to that question, what's wrong with us? Why the selfishness, the cruelty, the corruption, the crime, the racism, the injustice? Why?

Where does it come from? Now the Bible's answer is ancient and it's profound and that is sin in the human heart. One of the reasons why it's so widely rejected, I believe, is actually because what's not  understood is that the biblical understanding and doctrine of sin is multidimensional. All of us understand or remember, I think they understand what the Bible says about sin. We say yes, we know what the Bible says about sin.

Sin is breaking God's law and therefore we're guilty and condemned, yes, I know what the  Bible says, but that's only one. In fact, that's the last of the aspects of sin that we're going to look at in this series. I think one of the reasons why sin as an answer to the reason to the problems of our life  is tends to be widely overlooked by people is because we don't understand the multidimensionality  than how nuanced, how rich, see, how multi-perspectival the biblical teaching on sin is. We're going to look at the first of those dimensions today and we're going to read a  passage of scripture that I can almost proudly say, it's very possible and very likely that  even if you've gone to church all of your life, you've never heard anybody so stupid as  to try to preach a sermon on this text. This text is almost never preached on, I've never preached on, it's almost never studied.

It's the end of the book of Judges and one of the reasons why nobody knows what to do  with it, why it's there and so but nobody ever tries to speak about it is because it is  so inexplicably boring. Judges 17 versus 1 to 13, it's just the beginning of a story and I'll tell you how it ends. You don't need to know. Now a man named Micah from the hill country of Ephraim said to his mother,  you know the 1100 chequels of silver that were taken from you and about which I heard  you order a curse? I have that silver with me.

I took it. And then his mother said, the Lord bless you my son and when he returned the 1100 chequels  of silver to his mother she said, I solemnly consecrate my silver to the Lord for my son  to make a carved image and a cast idol. I will give it back to you, O Lord see. So he returned the silver to his mother and she took 200 chequels of silver and gave  them to a silversmith who made them into the image and the idol and they were put in  Micah's house. Now this man Micah had a shrine and he made an effort and some idols and installed one  of his sons as his priest.

In those days Israel had no king. Everyone did as he saw fit a young Levite from Bethlehem and Judah who had been living  within the clan of Judah left that town in search of some other place to stay and on  his way he came to Micah's house in the hill country of Ephraim and Micah asked him,  where are you from? Oh I'm a Levite from Bethlehem and Judah he asked he said, and I'm looking for a place  to stay then Micah said to him, live with me and be my father and priest and I'll give  you 10 chequels of silver a year your clothes and your food. So the Levite agreed to live with him and the young man was to him like one of his sons  and then Micah installed a Levite and the young man became his priest and lived in his  house and Micah said, now I know that the Lord will be good to me since this Levite has  become my priest. Now let me tell you what we have here.

One of the reasons why people ignore this section or really find it kind of confusing  is this, up to now everything in the book of Judges has been extremely interesting. Book of Judges is a history of Israel after they came into Canaan, they had been led there  by Moses and Joshua out of Egypt and they came into Canaan and what we have in the book  of Judges the first 16 chapters is a series of fascinating stories because over and over  the people would slide into sin and when they slide into sin they soon became enslaved  by some foreign power and then over and over again 12 times actually in the book God sends  a judge which is really a deliverer. You mustn't think in terms of a magistrate or someone sitting at a bench. A judge was a deliverer, essentially a savior and the judge would come and turn the people  bet away from sin back to God and liberate them from the military oppressors and it was  always fascinating. I'm very dramatic and some of the most famous people.

We have Gideon here, we have Deborah here, we have Samson in this book and it's always thrilling  and exciting to see the salvation come, they're saved you see. But then when you get to chapter 17 to chapter 21 there's these last five chapters and  they're very, very hard to understand because they don't seem to be about anything. There's no judges in here, there's no salvation that comes, God hardly shows up in some ways. And what's so intriguing is that there's two incidents. In chapter 17 and 18 we have one and you've read half of it and in chapter 19 to 21 you  have the other and the first one we've already read and what do we see here?

Well first of all we see three, if you're going to give this story a title and it couldn't  be a very interesting title because it's not a very interesting story, it's a bunch of  trivial people doing kind of dumb, weird things. I could call it Micah, Mom and the Levite. And what you have is you have these three people, first all you have Micah, cheating his mother. And then giving her the money back when she hears him, idling a curse against the robber  whoever it is and he says, well you know I'm, I did it, I robbed and I was kind of scared  when he's, you know he's not very good or very bad, I mean how good can you be to rob  your own mother but then how bad could you be to get, you know give it back, you know kind  of, gee I'm scared, you cursed, I wonder. And then so you see Micah, cheating his mother, then you see his mother cheating God because  if you notice when she's really excited she says I will give it all back to the Lord.

I'm so happy about this, I'm so happy my son came back and did all, he says I solemnly  constrict my silver, all I give it back but when she actually came to it she only used  200 checkers and she makes two images, two idols out of silver and puts them in in a sense  her son's chapel where he worshiped the Lord. In complete contradiction to everything God says anywhere, right in the tank of maim,  it's all through the law of Moses where he says you mustn't make images, you mustn't  make idols. So first we have Micah cheating mom, then we have mom cheating God and then along comes  the Levite. And on what's his point? Well Micah and his mother decided they were going to have their own shrine.

See in those days there was a tabernacle, a sanctuary, a place where God said worship  me here and it was at Shiloh. And in that tabernacle there was an effort that was the breastplate of a priest, that the  priest wore and had stones on there through which God spoke to people. There was an effort and there was a priest and the priest had to be Levites, they had to  be on the tribe of Levi. And there was a sanctuary where people could come and pray and worship. But Micah and mom, they wanted to have their own sanctuary, they wanted to have their own  place of worship.

And so they made one of their sons, mom's grandson, Micah's son, a priest until along comes  the Levite and Micah says, wow, I can have a genuine Levite here, just like in the law  of Moses. So he says how much would you know be willing to work for this amount and Levites says, sure,  fine. And so now he says, boy, now I've really got a Levite, I've got an effort, I've got everything  I want. Except in chapter 18, and this is how the story ends, a group of men come along, Danites,  they're trying to find a new place to live. And they say to the Levite, you come with me, come with us, we'll pay you more.

And bring those images along, which, of course, were worth quite a bit of money. And so Micah comes running out saying, you stole my Levite, you stole my images, what are  you doing in the Danites? I'd say, go home or I might hurt you. And so he did. And that's how the story ends.

And then in chapter 19 to 21, suddenly, at the very end of the book of Judges, we're completely  unprepared. After all these boring people doing all these trivial things, we're completely unprepared  for what happens. There's a gang rape of a woman that leads to not just civil war between the tribes of Israel,  but genocidal destruction of whole towns and villages down to the infants. And what's so strange about this, again, no judges, no salvation, no nothing, now what's  going on here. Now, on the one hand, this is terrible storytelling.

Now when I say terrible storytelling, I don't mean I think this was just made up, but you  see this incident was chosen out of this whole period of history. Why? Why was it chosen? When I say it's a bad story, first of all, in a good story, you have to somebody, some  character, who you get engaged with, that you care about, you have to have some character  that you're concerned about, otherwise it's just a terrible narrative. And nobody here you care about, see, they're all, none of them are very good or very bad.

They're very shallow. They're very uninteresting. They're boring, they're very unprincipled. They don't stand for anything. And not only that, there should be some kind of crisis, right, that's resolved.

But the crisis that there is only crises that come about because they're so shallow and  uninteresting and boring and unprincipled, why is this here? And why would this be in front of this horrible story that comes right after? Well, it began to dawn on me, and it's dawned on other people. I'm not the only one who knows this or understands this, please. There's no judges here, isn't this interesting?

Every other part of the book is about God's salvation, and what the author is showing us,  and therefore what God's showing us, is what we look like without a salvation, what we  look like without Him, what we are in our natural state. In other words, this is showing us the nature of sin. And this right away actually shows us some things that are very, very surprising to us. If you live in this society, you've got some, how do I say stereotypes about what you  think the Bible teaches about sin and about evil. And this goes right against it.

Look, real briefly, because we're going to the Lord's table today, and we're going  to have a series. Look, real briefly, let me show you. This tells us what sin does to us, what sin does to God, and how we can be cured of it. What sin does to us, what sin does to God, and how we can be cured of it. And every one of them is surprising.

The first one, what sin does to us. What do you think sin really does to you in its advanced stages? What does sin really do to the human heart? What does it do to the character? Most of us believe that most of us are kind of regular people.

Of course, we sin, of course, to air is sin and to air is human and so on. But when we think of people who are really diabolical, really, really advanced in their  evil, we think of evil geniuses. We think of the people in all of the action films as terrible, those charming, those witty,  but those diabolical, those cruel. That's not at all what the Bible says. When Hana Arant went to the trial of Adolf Heichmann, the Nazi butcher, she was shocked  by what she found.

And she wrote an essay that really got a lot of flak. She wrote an essay on what she called the banality of evil. Now banal is a word that basically means common. It means run of the mill. And she looked at this guy and she says, anybody could have done this must be a monster,  but when she saw him, she realizes this isn't a monster.

First of all, she found he was a boring little man. He spoke in clichés, no insights, really very little sense of humor. And he had the absolute run of the mill, like all the rest of us, desire to be important,  desire to be liked, ability to kind of, you know, not think about things that are unpleasant. And she wrote and she said, he wasn't a monster, he was just like all the rest of us. He was boring and superficial, and uninteresting, and shallow.

And people got very upset with her. And they said, you can't say that, anybody can do this, this man, anybody can do this  cannot be like us. And Hannah aren't got it partly right, but partly wrong, at least according to the Bible. Because she said, because he was so banal and superficial, it led him to do evil. But the Bible says it's evil that leads you to be banal.

The most advanced, the most prominent, the most characteristic, effective sin on the human  heart is not to make us bad but boring. There's nobody that said it better than C.S. Lewis, of course, and actually I've got  a number of his quotes that helped me with this sermon. He says, I am really upset with the most pernicious of all the literary images of evil. It's Gert is Mephistopheles in Faust.

The humorous, civilized Mephistopheles strengthens the illusion that evil is liberating. But the real mark of hell is a sleepless, unsmiling concentration upon the self. You must understand hell as a place where everyone is perpetually concerned about his or  her own dignity and advancement, where everybody always has a grievance, and where everybody  lives in the deadly seriousness of envy and self-importance. Here's another section, in preface to Paradise Lost Lewis as this, to admire Satanist  to give one's vote for a world of lies, propaganda, and incessant autobiography. At the choice as possible, hardly a day passes without some slight movement toward it in  every one of us.

Sin in each of us is something that once just to be petted and admired, to take advantage  of other lives. It especially wants to be left to itself. It wants to keep well away from anything better or stronger higher than it. Anything that would make it feel small, but unimpeded, sin will exploit the whole universe  if it could. Now, here's what Lewis is saying.

Here's what Hannah Arnt saw at least partially. Here's what we're being told. Why in the world would this be considered, a case study of human beings without God? Why not something more awful? Why not something more cruel?

Why not something more like the last part of the book? What is this about? And the answer is what Lewis says. The most interesting, advanced sin makes you boring because all you're ever worried about  is how you're doing, how you look, how things are affecting you. There's always agreements incessant autobiography.

You can never get out of yourself. You're always feeling sorry for yourself. And you know what's so weird about this. You say, ah, that's not like Jack Nicholson is the Joker in Batman. I mean, there's evil.

You know, no. Sin makes you mediocre. The most advanced sin makes there's nothing more boring than somebody's always worried  about how you look. Sin makes you these very uninteresting, unprincipled, shallow, boring people. It's pretty interesting.

There's an article called the Culture Zone Column in the New York Times Magazine today  about the tremendous popularity of one, you know, one-person shows. Have you seen that? Or they just get up and they stand up there and they talk about their lives and they talk  about their stories and they talk about everything, one-person shows. And virtually everybody knows it's sort of an open secret even though it keeps going  that the vast majority of people are just boring. The vast majority of people, those one-person shows, tell you way too much.

This is what the line says in the article, way too much about people that you have no desire  to know. Why are people so uninteresting when they just simply talk? They're not part of a story when they just say, here's how I feel. Here's what's on my mind. It's sleepless, unsmiling concentration on the self.

That's the essence of sin. And the first thing we see here is that what sin really does is not make you bad before  it makes you boring. That's the primary thing, incessant autobiography. But that's the first surprising thing. But the second surprising thing is, like, in a way more seminal.

It's in the Bible when sin ruins you. It's because already your attitude toward yourself is always based on your attitude toward  God. Your understanding of yourself is always based on your understanding of God. Your emotions toward yourself are always based on your emotions toward God. Because what we have here is just as surprising.

It tells us what sin leads us to do toward God. What does sin lead us to do? How does sin lead us to regard God? Now, again, most people would think that advance sin would make you an atheist. That's advanced.

We have a lot of those advanced sinners right around New York City, actually a pretty  surprising number. High percentage that don't want any other city in the country. People say, I don't believe in God. And maybe you're one of those. I don't know.

You know, somebody brought you here out of curiosity. Maybe you're one of those. Well, I got good news for you. Atheism is not the essence of sin at all. Here's what we're told.

Says, I dedicate to the Lord these two images. Boy, that's terrible. Doesn't she know what the 10 commandments says, the first commandment? They'll shout, not worship any other gods. Doesn't the first commandment say, I should have no other gods before me?

Why is she making those idols? Doesn't she know? Why would she worship other gods right there in front of God, right in his shrine, you see? And the answer is, she's not worshiping other gods. Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache.

We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way? And what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing this month, what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer.

Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer, Dr. Keller shows how the reality  of sin explains the pain we see all around us  and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes  or choices, or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world will help you see  how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us.

Listen, there's plenty of gods named in the book of Judges. The Canaanites had the bales and the asterisks and the Philistines had dagon and the Syrians had  Rimon and the Mowbites had Kimosh, but she doesn't say I'm going to make an Isle of Kimosh,  she didn't make a bale, she didn't make an asterisks, she didn't make a Kimosh, she  had a dagon of Rimon. What did she make? Who are these images of? Well, they're the ones in whose name they're dedicated.

These are images of God, these are images of the Lord God, these are images of Yahweh  the God of Israel. What she has done is not she hasn't, she hasn't worshipped another God and she's not worshiping  no God, she's worshipping a reduced God. She has whittled God down, she has made him, she has put a handle on him. This is a God you can put in your purse. This is a God you can take places with you.

This is a God who's manageable, this is a God who's tame and this is the heart of sin. A little God, a manageable tamed God will make you a little manageable, controllable  person. Is it? Han Ahren said the scary thing was that banal person was capable of unbelievable terror  and evil under certain circumstances. And the point at the end of the book of Judges is banal people caused by sin, sleepless  un, sleepless concentration on the self, unsmiling, humorless, therefore boring.

Incessant autobiography makes you feel so sorry for yourself that you are capable of  terrible things eventually. All of our problems come in essence from whittling God down, Psalm 50 verse 21 talks  about it, when God looks at the people and he doesn't say you've rejected me, he doesn't  even say you're worshiping other gods, what does he say? He says you thought this is songs 50 verse 21, you thought I was like yourself. And this is the essence of sin. We are sure God has got to be like us.

We're going to whittle them down to our size, let me give you some examples of how we  do it. The only few, Kathy said please keep it at about 30 because we were sitting and talking  about him. I began to realize, well this is the essence, look number one, first of all we think  God's like us and we think he can be bought. Some of you have started coming to church, started reading your Bible, started cleaning up  your life because you say I need strength, I need inspiration, stop it. Well, wait a minute, shouldn't I read my Bible, shouldn't I pray?

Should I live a good life, shouldn't I come to church, isn't that what God wants? Well, he said all depends on why you're doing it because here's what I'm afraid, almost  always the way we, when we move toward God, our hearts are filled with this and therefore  we always in the beginning start like this. We think God can be bought, we think God can be impressed. And the reason we start cleaning our life up is what? So we can say, and here's the essence of sin, now God has to be good to me because I'm  doing everything right.

See, Michael was so happy that he knew he was out of compliance with his own son as a  priest. He realized what the word of God said, but oh, wait a minute, I can get a leave, I'll leave  it. Now surely God will be good to me, he's obeying, but why is he obeying? To get control of God, to buy him, highly religious people who are absolutely sure that  God has to be good to you, God has to answer your prayers, God has to bless you, God has  to give you a good life, God has to give you the spouse of your dreams, why? Because I'm doing everything right.

Now the Lord has to be good to me, what have you done? You put a handle on God, you're trying to control God, you whittled him down, you think  he's like you, they can be bought, they can be impressed, he can't be. And by the way, there's nothing they'll make you more boring than making you a smug  self-righteous religious person, nothing, they're the worst kind. Little God creates little people. Secondly, we think God's like us because, you know, it can be bought, secondly, you think  God's like you because you don't think he's any wiser than you are.

Do you know why we're so scared so often, why we're so angry because things aren't going  right? Do you know why so many of you have walked away saying, I cannot believe in a God who  would let this happen and this happen and this happen. What are you saying? What are you saying? What you're saying is because I can't think of a good reason for this to have happened,  there can't be one.

Now, when you say, I can't believe in a God who would let this happen, you simply have  pulled him down, you said, he couldn't be wiser than me, well, not what? How acidized is that intellectually? You know, to say, if you believe there's a God big enough to have caused this, then you've  got to believe there's a God who's big enough to have some reason for it bigger than you,  that you wouldn't know. You can't have it both ways. You can't be mad at God because you acknowledge He's more powerful than you, but then you will  let Him be more wise than you.

I mean, that's just, and yet we're so bitter in our soul and we're so cast down all the  time. Why? Because we just don't believe God. You believe I'm like you, He says. You have whittled me down.

You've made me into an image something controllable. You've revised me. You've edited me. You've pulled me down. You know, Elizabeth Alleya, who often quote, when she, there was a book she wrote years  ago about her husband and a number of other women's husbands were killed in the jungles  of South America as part of their missionary work.

It's called Through the Gates of Splendor, and many years later, it was reissued in a  kind of silver anniversary edition, and she wrote an epilogue to it, and this is what  she said in it, and it just slammed me. She says, people asked me, what did you learn from all that? What did you learn from your husband, the love of your life being killed when you had  a little baby girl and you'd only been married for two years? What did you learn? And this is what she said.

I have reflected on all that happened to me, and one thing, one thing is pointed out, quote,  if he is God, he is worthy of my worship and my service, and I will find rest nowhere,  but in his will, and that will is infinitely immeasurably, unspeakably beyond my largest  notion of what he is up to. The one thing I learned is if he's God, I will find no rest anywhere but in his will,  and that's true of everybody in the face of this earth. They'll never be freedom in your heart unless you are willing to admit that his will is  infinitely immeasurably, unspeakably beyond my largest notion of what he's up to. Let me give you a couple more. We think he's like us in math, in other words, we think he can be bought.

Secondly, we think he is like us in his wisdom, therefore, we can't think of something. If we get no worries up to them, he can't be up to anything good. Thirdly, we think he's like us in our scale. Scale, I got this from Kathy late last night. She's been reading the series in the New York Times Science section on what we're  learning about the galaxies.

Now listen, you know this, you know, stuff like this. The distance from the earth to the sun, 93 million miles, was reduced to the thickness  of a piece of paper. Then the diameter of just this galaxy would be a stack of paper, 310 miles high. And our galaxy is just one of gazillions and gazillions of galaxies just in our cluster. Our galaxy relates just to the cluster of galaxies.

The way a single grain of sand would relate to all the beaches on the entire and all the  sand and all the coasts of Florida, that's how many galaxies there are. And that's just in our cluster. And even from the moon, you can't see us, we're going to expect from the moon. And yet the Bible says that if there is a God, think about this, he holds the world together. He holds it all up with the word of his power.

The entire universe is like a contact lens on his little finger. Now, do you say to somebody like that, please come into my life to be my assistant? Do you say to somebody like that, don't call us, we'll call you? Do you say something like that? Well yeah, I might deal with you after I've had a little fun.

I've moved to New York City after all. Do you say, well, I'll be happy to believe in you if you give me a complete explanation  for all of my questions. You've forgotten the scale. You think I'm like, you are da, you know, the audacity of it, give you another one. You know racism is, racism is, it's taking cultural differences and I'm viewing them with  moral significance.

Let's just say, listen, white racism isn't the only kind of racism, but it's pretty prominent. So let me pick on us white people, all right, for a second. Okay, what do white people do? They, especially what do northern European types do, you know, us with the background,  you know, British or German and all that. We see these ethnic groups and they're much more emotional.

So when they're happy, they're more emotional and when they're sad, they're more emotional. What do you feel when you see that? You say, this sort of lost it haven't they kind of, you know, they're different, but you  deepen your heart, have assigned moral superiority to your difference and moral inferiority  to their difference. And they're going to do the same thing. I know that, but here's the point.

What is white racism? It's saying, my God is white. My God is like me. God is white. That's exactly what Psalm 50 verse 21, you thought I was like, you, everything comes from  that.

All of our doubts, all of our anger, you see, all of our self-righteousness. I'll give you another one, you think God is like you in his attitude toward time. You know, when God sees time, he sees it all at once. If you were high up over the earth, he would look down at the Mississippi River and all parts  of the Mississippi River would be equally visible, right? If you're down on the Mississippi River, you only see your bend.

Now, a lot of you are saying, oh, years ago, yes, I did this and yes, I did this and yes,  I did these things, but you know, they were bad, but you know, I've gotten over it. Certainly God wouldn't hold that against me. My friends, God's attitude toward God is the very, the thing you remember way in the past,  he is seeing now. He's still happening right in his nostrils. This is the reason why God has got of justice.

This is the reason why God never gets over anything. This is the reason why there has to be atonement, there has to be punishment. And when you say, well, you know, why, I can't believe in a God who judges, you think he's  like you. You think that because of the terrible things you've done and at the time you felt dog  on guilty and it hurt a lot of people, but now it's been a year, it's been two years,  it's been ten years, it doesn't bother you anymore. We thought I was like you.

All of our problems come from this. Because God, our God has become little, we've made him little, we've made him manageable,  we get rid of the things that we don't like. Oh, I can't believe in this anymore, I can't believe in that anymore. We've whittled him down as a result. We've been whittled up, there's no greatness to us, there's no freedom.

Do you realize if you really accepted the God that Elizabeth always talking about, a God  who is infinite, his will is infinitely and measurably beyond anything you can ever, any  notion of what he's up to? If you said, I accept that, I embrace that, you'd be free, totally free, nothing can bother  you anymore. If you said, I'm not trying to obey God so He'll be good to me, so He'll give me the things  I want, so He'll give me the status, He'll give me the marriage, so He'll give me the things  I want. Instead, if you said, but He said, not I'm going to use Him to get the things that give me  meaning in life, but that He is my meaning in life. If you really made Him your meaning in life, if He was the ultimate instead of just a little  means to an end, something you've learned how to handle in order to get what you want.

If He was your meaning in life, in other words, if He was big, you'd be big. If He was great in your eyes, you'd be a great heart. You would walk through life greatly, you wouldn't be scared and upset and circumstances beating  you around all the time. This is the reason why there's this one little place in the Narnia Chronicles, those fairy  tales by C.S. Lewis.

It goes by so fast that you just don't even notice its significance, but it's so incredibly  interesting. It's where little Lucy meets Aslan, who's Jesus. He's a lion, and she meets him in the second book, and she says, Aslan, at last, welcome  child. He says, Aslan said, Lucy, you're bigger. That's because you're older, little child.

Not because you're bigger? No. The bigger you get, the more you grow, the more you'll find me bigger. Now, what does He say? It goes by so fast, you don't even stop and think about it, Pilates.

Lewis is saying, the bigger your God is, the bigger you will be. The more you let God be God, the more you make Him not a means to an end but the end. Not someone has to answer your questions. The more you put Him on His proper scale, the more of a great heart you will be. Well, how?

How is it possible? How in the world? And you know what? The normal thing for Christian to do, and I'll tell you, over the years, I used to end  my sermons here. I used to say, now what?

I know. I've got sermons like this from the past. I've been looking at them over the last couple of weeks. I would say study the attributes of God. Think of His holiness.

Think of His majesty. Think of His wisdom. Don't whittle them down. Except everything the Bible says about it. What is this commandment where He says, do not make a graven image of me, He says.

And what He's saying is, don't imagine me to be what you want me to be but worship me  as I am. So what does it mean? Except what He says. But you know what? When I study, when I just study His holiness, when I just study His majesty, when I just  study His wisdom, I don't feel, I'm not getting greater, I'm not getting bigger.

It just starts to crush me and it'll crush you. This thing that has on saying to Lucy, I don't sense that dynamic at all, it just makes  me feel worse and worse and worse. It's like, oh my word, this is God but I'm going to have to just put up with it. But the answer is this, in verse 6, it says, the reason for all this was there was no  king. Do you see that?

It says, the reason all this idiotic, idiocy, the reason all this smallness in those days  Israel had no king. Now what is the author saying? He says, there's no savior. We need something better than these judges. We need a king.

But when you get to the king, even the best king, David, we see that he needed a savior. And what we're being pointed to is simply this. Why is it that God said no image? Why is it that Israel was the only religion on the face of the earth at that time? It's the first religion, almost invented it.

That if you went into this temple, you went into the holy of Holies, into the inner sanctum,  and you even went to the ark of the covenant, which is the throne of God. There was the cherubim, the angels, facing inward, and right where you expect to see an  image, something palpable, something you could grab hold on, something accessible, right? We're physical beings, we have, we have, we taste touch here, see smell, we have senses  and we want to see something, we want to feel something. And right there, there's nothing. God says, don't you, they're putting an image there.

My throne is empty. Can you say how my word is that it? We have to put up with an abstract invisible God, a God we can't touch, God we can't see  here, or smell, and God says, no, no, no, no, don't you dare put an image there, but not  because there never will be one. In Colossians chapter 1, verse 15, we read something amazing, he is the image, Jesus Christ,  is the image of the invisible God, for by him all created, all things were created, whether  the thrones or powers or rulers or authorities. Now here's what God is saying, God is saying, I understand why you want an image.

I understand why you want something you can grab hold on, and I will give you something. I will supply the image, don't you supply the image because any image you try to make  me, make of me, to make me something you can relate to will only make me tinier and  smaller and it will make you smaller. But I will give you the true image, a living image, the Lord Jesus Christ, and he will  so reveal my glory that on the one hand he will be someone you finally can relate to  a human being a person, someone who loves and who weeps and who embraces, finally someone  who is successful but somebody who actually makes me in your mind greater than you could  imagine. Not smaller but greater, why? Because this great God, you know, before whom we are nothing but specks, we are nothing but  specks of dust, we are nothing but paramecium, we are nothing but amoebas.

No other image could possibly have told us what this image does and that is he came to  die for us, he died for the paramecium, he died for the amoebas. When you have a God that is so big that he could become small, you got a bigger God than  you could have imagined. No other religion has such a God, no other religion admits that God is so big he could have  become small. Only when you have a God like that, only when you admit that Jesus Christ is the image  of God that he died for me, that is what finally shows me a greatness beyond anything I would  know otherwise but it is not a greatness that crushes me. Now I want to live for him.

Now I don't say, now God has got to be good to me because I am obeying all the rules because  Jesus is my goodness. He is the thing. I would want more than that, he is my meaning in life now. You see God can't be bought but we can. The bigger he gets, the bigger we will get.

Let's pray. Father, we know that one of the reasons for the Lord's supper is it is something physical. It is something we can put in our hands and it reminds us that you have put Jesus Christ  on the earth to be our image, image of you, our way of understanding your greatness. It is only as we receive him, as we remember what he has done, that you finally take in our  minds your proper proportions and when that happens we will be so free. We pray, Lord, that you will make yourself real to us and your proper proportions as we  take the Lord's supper as we take the bread and the cup.

Be yourself in our eyes, be yourself in our hearts, be yourself so we can finally be ourselves. What you have made us to be in Jesus' name we pray, amen.

今天的教导中，提姆·凯勒会来看：圣经关于罪的教导，如何让我们对这个世界有一种极其诚实、却又令人难以置信地充满盼望的看法。请翻到你们周报里印着经文的那一页。本周我们开始一个新的系列，主题是“罪”。在实践层面、在根本层面，没有什么比明白那个最基本的人类问题的答案更相关、更实用：我们到底怎么了？如果你正试着养育一个家庭，或经营一家公司，或参与政治或社区事务，或者你在这人生里做任何事情，你都需要有一个能运作的理论来回答这个问题：我们怎么了？为什么会有自私、残酷、腐败、犯罪、种族主义、不公义？为什么？

这一切从哪里来？圣经的回答既古老又深刻：在人心里的罪。为什么这答案如此普遍地被拒绝？我相信，其中一个原因，其实是人们不明白：圣经对罪的理解与教义是“多维度”的。我们所有人都以为自己明白、或至少记得圣经怎么说罪。我们会说：是的，我们知道圣经怎么说罪。

罪就是违背上帝的律法，因此我们有罪、被定罪——是的，我知道圣经怎么说；但那只是其中一个面向。事实上，在这个系列里，我们最后才会讲到罪的这个面向。我想，罪作为解释我们生活问题根源的答案，之所以常常被人忽略，其中一个原因就是：我们不懂得圣经关于罪的教导是多维度的，它多么精细、多么丰富——你看，多么多角度、多么多视点。今天我们要看其中第一个维度。我们要读一段经文，我几乎可以“骄傲”地说：很有可能、也很大概率，就算你一辈子都在教会，你也从没听过有人傻到想用这段经文讲一篇道。这段经文几乎从来没人讲；我也从没讲过；几乎从来没人研究。

它在《士师记》的末尾。之所以没人知道怎么处理它、为什么它会在那儿、所以也没人尝试讲它，是因为它莫名其妙地无聊。《士师记》17章1到13节——它只是一个故事的开头，我可以告诉你它怎么结束。你其实不需要知道。以法莲山地有一个人名叫米迦，他对母亲说：“你知道那从你那里被拿走的一千一百舍客勒银子吗？我听见你为那事发咒诅。我这里有那银子。

是我拿了。”他母亲就说：“我儿啊，耶和华赐福与你。”他把那一千一百舍客勒银子还给母亲的时候，母亲说：“我从心里把这银子分别为圣献给耶和华，为我儿子做一个雕刻的像和一个铸造的偶像。现在我把这银子还给你。你看，献给耶和华。”于是他把银子还给母亲。母亲拿出二百舍客勒银子交给银匠，银匠把银子做成那像和那偶像，放在米迦的家里。这个米迦有一个神龛；他又做了以弗得和一些偶像，立了他一个儿子作祭司。

那时以色列中没有王，各人任意而行。有一个少年利未人，从犹大伯利恒来，原住在犹大族中；他离开那城，寻找可以寄居的地方。走着走着，他来到以法莲山地米迦的家。米迦问他：“你从哪里来？”他说：“我是利未人，从犹大伯利恒来，我在寻找一个住处。”米迦对他说：“你可以住在我这里，作我的父和祭司。我每年给你十舍客勒银子，并给你衣服和食物。”于是那利未人就答应住下。那少年人待他如同自己的一个儿子。米迦就立那利未人；那少年人作了他的祭司，住在米迦的家里。米迦说：“现在我知道耶和华必恩待我，因为这利未人作了我的祭司。”现在让我告诉你：我们这里到底是什么。

人们之所以忽略这一段，或觉得它挺令人困惑，原因是：到目前为止，《士师记》里的一切都极其精彩。《士师记》记载的是以色列进迦南之后的历史：他们在摩西和约书亚的带领下出埃及，进了迦南。在《士师记》前十六章里，是一连串引人入胜的故事，因为百姓一次又一次滑入罪中；他们一滑入罪中，很快就会被某个外邦势力奴役；然后一次又一次——事实上书中有十二次——上帝差遣一位“士师”，其实就是拯救者。你不要把“士师”想成坐在法官席上的裁判。士师是拯救者，本质上就是“救主”。士师来，使百姓从罪回转归向上帝，并把他们从军事压迫者手中释放出来；这总是令人着迷，非常戏剧性，也出现了许多最著名的人物。

这本书里有基甸、有底波拉、有参孙。看到拯救临到、他们得救，总是令人兴奋激动。但到了第17章到第21章，这最后五章却非常、非常难懂，因为它们看起来不像在讲任何东西。这里没有士师，没有拯救临到；某种意义上，上帝几乎不出现。奇怪的是，这里有两件事：第17、18章是一件，你们已经读了一半；第19到21章是另一件。第一件我们刚刚读了；在这里我们看见什么？

首先，如果你要给这个故事起个标题，那也不可能是很有意思的标题，因为这不是个很有意思的故事：一群琐碎的人做着一些愚蠢、古怪的事。我可以把它叫作《米迦、妈妈和利未人》。你看到的就是这三个人：第一是米迦，骗了自己的母亲；然后当他听见母亲在咒诅那个偷钱的人——不管那人是谁——他就把钱还回去。他说：“嗯，你知道……是我做的，是我抢的；我有点害怕……”他既不算太好，也不算太坏——你说，一个人能好到哪里去，居然抢自己母亲的钱？可你说他能坏到哪里去，又把钱还了回来？有点像“哎呀我怕了；你都咒诅了；我想想……”所以你看到米迦骗母亲；接着你看到他的母亲骗上帝，因为你注意到她特别兴奋时说：“我要把这银子全都献给耶和华。”

“我太高兴了；我太高兴我儿子回来了、还做了……”她说：“我郑重把我的银子分别为圣；全部都献上；我把它献回去。”可当她真的要做的时候，却只拿了二百舍客勒；她用银子做了两个像、两个偶像，然后把它们放在她儿子的“礼拜堂”里——在那里他敬拜耶和华。这与上帝在任何地方所说的一切完全相反；在摩西的律法里处处都说：“你们不可做形像；你们不可做偶像。”所以先是米迦骗妈妈；接着是妈妈骗上帝；然后利未人出现了。他在这里扮演什么角色？米迦和他母亲决定要有自己的神龛。

你看，那时有会幕——圣所——上帝说：“要在这里敬拜我”，那在示罗。在会幕里有以弗得，就是祭司穿的胸牌，上面有石头，上帝借此对人说话。有以弗得，也有祭司；祭司必须是利未人，必须出自利未支派。那是一个人们可以来祷告、敬拜的圣所。但米迦和他妈妈想要自己的圣所；他们想要自己的敬拜地点。

于是他们就立了自己的一个儿子——妈妈的外孙、米迦的儿子——作祭司。直到利未人来了，米迦说：“哇，我现在可以有一个真正的利未人了，正如摩西律法里那样。”于是他问：“那你愿意用这个价钱来做吗？”利未人说：“当然，好。”于是米迦说：“哎呀，现在我真有了一个利未人；我有以弗得；我有我想要的一切。”只不过到了第18章——故事就是这样结束的——有一群但人走过来，他们想找个新地方住。他们对利未人说：“你跟我们来吧；跟我们走吧；我们给你更多钱。”

“把那些像也带上。”当然，那些像值不少钱。于是米迦跑出来说：“你们偷走了我的利未人，你们偷走了我的像，你们在做什么？”但人说：“回家去，不然我可能伤害你。”于是他就回去了。故事就这样结束。

然后到了第19到21章，突然，在《士师记》的最后，我们完全毫无准备。在这些无聊的人做着琐碎事之后，我们完全没准备好面对接下来发生的事：有一个女人遭到轮奸；这导致的不仅是以色列各支派之间的内战，还导致对整座城镇、村落的种族灭绝式毁灭，甚至连婴孩都不放过。更奇怪的是——同样地——没有士师，没有拯救，没有任何东西。那么，这里到底在发生什么？从某种角度看，这是一种糟糕的叙事。

我说“糟糕的叙事”，并不是说我认为这只是杜撰的；而是你看，这个事件是在这整个历史时期里被挑出来的。为什么？为什么挑它？我说它是个糟糕的故事：首先，一个好故事里，你得有某个角色，让你投入、让你在乎；你得有某个你关心的人物，否则这叙事就很糟。可这里没有任何一个你会在乎的人——你看，他们都不是很善也不是很恶。

他们很肤浅，很乏味，很无聊，很没有原则；他们不为任何东西站立。而且不仅如此，一个好故事里还应该有某种危机，对吧？然后被解决。

可是这里的危机，只有那些因为他们肤浅、乏味、无聊、没原则而产生的危机。为什么要放在这里？为什么要放在后面那段恐怖故事之前？后来我开始恍然大悟，其他人也早就看见了——我不是唯一知道或理解的人，拜托。这里没有士师，这不是很有意思吗？

书里其他每一部分都在讲上帝的拯救；而作者在向我们展示——因此也是上帝在向我们展示——若没有拯救，我们是什么样；若没有祂，我们是什么样；我们在自然状态里是什么样。换句话说，这在展示罪的本质。这立刻让我们看见一些非常、非常出乎意料的事。如果你生活在这个社会里，你对“圣经关于罪和邪恶的教导”大概会有一些刻板印象。我所说的内容正好与那些刻板印象相反。

我们简单一点，因为今天我们要守主的圣餐，而我们还会有一个系列。简单说，我给你看看：这段告诉我们：罪对我们做什么，罪对上帝做什么，以及我们如何得医治。罪对我们做什么，罪对上帝做什么，我们如何得医治。每一点都令人惊讶。

第一点：罪对我们做什么。你以为罪在更“成熟”的阶段，会怎样真正影响你？罪到底对人的心做了什么？它对人的品格做了什么？我们大多数人相信：我们大多数人都算是普通人。

当然，我们会犯罪；当然，“犯错是人之常情”之类。但当我们想到那些真正魔鬼般、邪恶已经“进阶”的人，我们会想到“邪恶的天才”。我们会想到动作片里那些可怕的人——迷人、机智，却又邪恶、残酷。可圣经一点也不是这么说的。汉娜·阿伦特去旁听阿道夫·艾希曼——那位纳粹屠夫——的审判时，她被自己所见震惊了。

她写了一篇文章，引发了很大争议。她称之为“恶的平庸性”。“banal”（平庸）这个词基本意思就是“普通”“寻常”“司空见惯”。她看着这个人说：能做出这种事的人一定是怪物；可她一看见他，就意识到：这不是怪物。

首先，她发现他是个无聊的小人物。他满口陈词滥调，没有洞见，几乎没有幽默感。而且他有一种绝对寻常、跟我们所有人一样的东西：渴望重要，渴望被喜欢，也有一种能力——你懂的——去不想那些令人不愉快的事。她写道：他不是怪物；他就像我们其他人一样。他无聊、肤浅、乏味、浅薄。

人们对她非常愤怒。他们说：你不能这么说；能做出这种事的人不可能像我们一样。按照圣经的说法，汉娜·阿伦特有一半对、一半错。因为她说：因为他如此平庸、如此肤浅，所以导致他作恶。但圣经说：是“恶”导致你变得平庸。

罪在人的心上最进阶、最显著、最具代表性、最有效的作用，不是让我们变坏，而是让我们变得无聊。没有人比 C.S. 路易斯说得更好。当然，我这里也引用了他好几段话，这些都帮助我准备这篇讲道。他说：“我真的对文学中最恶劣的邪恶形象感到不满：那就是歌德《浮士德》里的梅菲斯特。”

“那位幽默、文明的梅菲斯特，强化了一种错觉：邪恶是解放人的。但地狱真正的标记，是一种不眠、不笑的自我专注。你必须把地狱理解为这样一个地方：每个人都永远关心自己的尊严与晋升；人人总觉得自己受了委屈；人人都活在嫉妒与自我重要感那种致命的严肃里。”他在《失乐园》序言里还说：“去钦佩撒但，就是为一个充满谎言、宣传和无休止自传的世界投票。只要有可能，几乎没有一天我们每个人不会朝那个方向略微挪动一步。”

“我们每个人里面的罪，都渴望被抚摸、被欣赏；渴望利用别人的生命。它尤其想被放任自流。它想尽量远离任何比它更好、更强、更高的东西——任何会让它觉得自己渺小的东西。若不受阻碍，罪甚至会利用整个宇宙（如果它做得到）。”这就是路易斯在说的。

这也至少部分解释了汉娜·阿伦特所看到的。也是这段经文在告诉我们的：为什么这会被当作“没有上帝的人类”的个案研究？为什么不挑更可怕的？为什么不挑更残忍的？

为什么不挑更像本书后半部分那样的？这到底在讲什么？答案就是路易斯所说的：最“高级”、最“有看头”的罪，会让你变得无聊，因为你所担心的一切，只是你过得怎么样，你看起来怎样，事情如何影响你。你总是在不断地自我叙述。

你永远走不出自己；你总是在自怜。奇怪的是，你会说：“啊，这不像《蝙蝠侠》里杰克·尼科尔森演的小丑，那才叫邪恶。”

不，罪让你变得平庸。最进阶的罪，会让你成为那种最无聊的人——永远担心自己看起来怎样。罪把你变成非常乏味、没有原则、肤浅、无聊的人。这很值得玩味。

今天《纽约时报杂志》里有一篇文章，标题大概是“文化区专栏”，讲的是所谓“一人秀”——你看过吗？就是一个人上台站着，讲自己的生活，讲自己的故事，讲各种事。一人秀非常受欢迎。几乎人人都知道——这是个公开的秘密，尽管它还在流行——绝大多数人其实很无聊。绝大多数人的一人秀，告诉你太多太多。

文章里有一句话是这么说的：“关于你根本不想认识的人，说得实在太多。”为什么当人只是单纯开口讲“我”的时候，会这么不有趣？当他们不在一个故事里，只是说“我觉得怎样”“我脑子里在想什么”，他们就变得很无聊。这就是那种不眠、不笑的自我专注。

这就是罪的本质。我们在这里看到的第一件事是：罪真正做的，不是先把你变坏，而是先把你变得无聊。那是最主要的：无休止的自我叙述。这是第一件令人惊讶的事。第二件令人惊讶的事，在某种意义上更根本。

圣经说，当罪毁掉你时，是因为你对自己的态度，总是建立在你对上帝的态度之上。你对自己的理解，总是建立在你对上帝的理解之上。你对自己的情绪，总是建立在你对上帝的情绪之上。因为我们在这里所看到的同样出人意料：

它告诉我们：罪会引导我们怎样对待上帝。罪会引导我们做什么？罪会引导我们怎样看待上帝？再次强调，大多数人会以为：更“高级”的罪，会让你成为无神论者——那才算进阶。

在纽约市周围就有很多这样的“进阶罪人”，数量之多其实挺令人吃惊；比例之高，几乎全国没有哪个城市比得上。人们说：“我不信上帝。”也许你就是其中之一；我不知道。

也许有人只是出于好奇把你带来这里。也许你就是那样的人。那我有个好消息：无神论根本不是罪的本质。我们在这里所看见的是——

她说：“我把这两个像献给耶和华。”哎呀，太糟糕了！她不知道十诫怎么说吗？第一条诫命？人们会喊：“不可敬拜别神！”第一条不是说“除了我以外，你不可有别神”吗？

那她为什么要造偶像？她不知道吗？她怎么会在上帝面前、在祂的圣所里敬拜别的神呢？答案是：她并不是在敬拜别的神。我们所到之处，都看见破碎、战争、残酷与心碎。

我们在周围的世界里、在自己的生命里都感受到这些。它怎么会变成这样？又能做些什么？提姆·凯勒在本月推出的全新著作《世界怎么了？》（What Is Wrong with the World）中，给出了清晰且充满怜悯的回答。

凯勒博士从他在 Redeemer 教会的一系列讲道中汲取内容，说明“罪”的现实如何解释我们四周所看见的痛苦，以及为什么只有福音才能带来持久的自由与医治。无论你是对这个世界的现状感到不堪重负，还是在自己的错误或选择中挣扎，或是在寻找盼望与喜乐，《世界怎么了？》都会帮助你看见：福音如何回应我们世界的心碎，也如何回应我们每个人内心的疼痛。这本新出版的《世界怎么了？》是我们为感谢你本月的奉献而送出的礼物，你的奉献将帮助 Gospel in Life 传扬耶稣的好消息。请今天就到 gospelonlife.com/give 领取你的赠书：gospelonlife.com/give。

你听，《士师记》里其实点过许多神的名字。迦南人有巴力和亚斯他录；非利士人有大衮；叙利亚人有临门；摩押人有基抹。但她并没有说“我要做一个基抹的像”；她没有做巴力，没有做亚斯他录，没有做基抹，也没有做大衮或临门。她做的是什么？这些像是谁的像？是奉谁的名献上的？

它们是上帝的像，是主上帝的像，是以色列的上帝耶和华的像。她所做的，不是敬拜另一位神，也不是不敬拜神；她是在敬拜一个被缩小的神。她把上帝削减了；她把祂做小了；她给祂装上了一个“把手”。这是一个你可以放进钱包里的上帝。这是一个你可以带着到处走的上帝。

这是一个可掌控的上帝；这是一个被驯服的上帝；而这就是罪的核心。一个小小的、可管理、被驯服的上帝，会把你变成一个小小的、可管理、可控制的人，是吗？汉娜·阿伦特说，最可怕的是：那个平庸的人在某些情境下竟能做出难以置信的恐怖与邪恶。《士师记》末尾要表达的就是：被罪塑造出来的平庸之人——那种不眠的、对自我的专注，不笑、无幽默、因此无聊。

无休止的自我叙述让你如此自怜，以至于你终究会做出可怕的事。我们所有的问题，本质上都来自把上帝削小。《诗篇》50篇21节说到这一点：当上帝看着百姓时，祂并没有说“你们拒绝了我”；祂甚至没有说“你们在敬拜别神”；祂说了什么？祂说（诗50:21）：“你以为我恰和你一样。”这就是罪的本质：我们确信上帝一定得像我们。

我们要把祂削减到我们的尺寸。让我给你一些例子说明我们如何这样做。只是几个例子——凯西说请把它控制在大约30分钟，因为我们昨晚坐着谈这些时……我开始意识到：这就是核心。第一，我们以为上帝像我们，我们以为祂可以被收买。有些人开始来教会，开始读圣经，开始“收拾”自己的生活，因为你说：“我需要力量，我需要灵感。”停一下。等等——我不该读圣经吗？我不该祷告吗？

我不该过好生活吗？我不该来教会吗？这不就是上帝要的吗？答案取决于你为什么这样做。因为我所担心的是：几乎总是，当我们走向上帝时，我们心里充满这种东西，所以一开始我们几乎都会这样：我们以为上帝可以被收买、被打动。那我们为什么开始把生活“整理”起来？为了什么？为了我们可以说——这就是罪的核心——“现在上帝必须对我好，因为我做得都对。”

你看，米迦很高兴，因为他知道让自己的儿子当祭司，其实不合规。他知道上帝的话怎么说。可他又想：“等等，我可以找一个利未人——我会找一个。”于是他说：“现在当然上帝会对我好。”他在“顺服”，但他为什么顺服？为了控制上帝，为了收买祂。那些非常宗教的人，坚信上帝必须对你好，上帝必须答应你的祷告，上帝必须赐福你，上帝必须给你美好的人生，上帝必须给你梦中情人——为什么？因为“我都做对了”。

“现在主必须对我好。”你做了什么？你给上帝装上把手；你试图控制上帝；你把祂削小；你以为祂像你——人能被收买、能被打动；祂不能。而且顺便说一句：没有什么比把你变成一个自鸣得意、自以为义的宗教人更能让你无聊；没有任何东西；这种人是最糟糕的。小小的上帝制造小小的人。第二，我们以为上帝像我们：第一祂能被收买；第二，你以为上帝像你，是因为你不觉得祂比你更有智慧。

你知道我们为什么经常那么害怕、那么愤怒，因为事情不按我们想的走？你知道为什么那么多人离开说：“我无法相信一个会让这件事发生、那件事发生、这件事发生的上帝。”你在说什么？你在说什么？你在说：因为我想不出一个好的理由让这件事发生，所以就不可能有理由。

当你说“我无法相信一个会让这件事发生的上帝”，你其实就是把祂拉下来：你说祂不可能比我更有智慧。那在智性上多么荒唐！你知道，如果你相信有一位上帝大到足以造成这件事，那么你也必须相信：祂大到足以拥有一个比你更大的理由——你并不知道。你不可能两边都要。你不能因为承认祂比你更有能力而对祂生气，却又不允许祂比你更有智慧。

这就是……可我们灵魂里却如此苦毒，我们常常如此沮丧。为什么？因为我们其实不信上帝。“你以为我和你一样，”祂说。你把我削小了。

你把我变成一个可控制的形像。你修订了我；你编辑了我；你把我拉下来。你知道，我常引用伊丽莎白·艾略特（Elizabeth Elliot）。她多年前写过一本书，讲她的丈夫，以及一些其他女性的丈夫，在南美丛林里执行宣教工作时被杀。

那本书叫《穿越荣耀之门》（Through the Gates of Splendor）。许多年后，这书以类似“银婚纪念版”再版，她为再版写了一个后记。她在其中说的话重重击中了我。她说：人们问我，“你从这一切学到了什么？你的丈夫——你生命的挚爱——被杀的时候，你有一个小婴儿女儿，你们结婚才两年；你学到了什么？”她是这么说的：

“我反思了发生在我身上的一切，有一件事——一件事——格外明显。”她写道：“如果祂是上帝，祂就配得我敬拜与服事；除了祂的旨意之外，我在任何地方都找不到安息。而那旨意，远远、无穷无尽地、难以测度地、不可言说地，超出我对于祂正在做什么的最大想象。”她说：“我学到的唯一一件事就是：如果祂是上帝，除了在祂的旨意里，我在任何地方都找不到安息。”这对地球上每一个人都是真的。除非你愿意承认：祂的旨意远远、无穷无尽地、不可言说地超越你对“祂在做什么”的最大想象，否则你心里永远不会有自由。再给你几个例子：我们以为祂在“数学”上像我们，也就是说，我们以为祂能被收买。

第二，我们以为祂在智慧上像我们：因此如果我们想不出祂在做什么好事，那祂就不可能在做什么好事。第三，我们以为祂在“尺度”上像我们。这个“尺度”的例子是我昨晚从凯西那里听来的。她一直在读《纽约时报》科学版关于我们对星系的新认识的系列文章。

你听，像这样的事你们都知道：从地球到太阳的距离是九千三百万英里。如果把它缩小到一张纸的厚度，那么仅仅我们这个银河系的直径，就会相当于一叠纸，高达310英里。而我们的银河系，只是我们这一个星系团里无数无数星系中的一个。我们的银河系相对于一个星系团，

就像一粒沙相对于整个地球上所有海滩的沙子——尤其是佛罗里达海岸上所有的沙子——那样的比例。这就是星系的数量。而这还只是在我们这个星系团里。从月球上你甚至看不见我们——至少你不能指望从月球上看清。但圣经说：如果有一位上帝，想想看，祂托住万有；祂用自己大能的命令托住一切。

整个宇宙就像祂小指上的一片隐形眼镜。现在，你会对这样的一位说：“请进到我生命里来当我的助手”吗？你会对这样的一位说：“别打给我们，我们会打给你”吗？你会这么说吗？你会说：“嗯，我先玩一阵子再说；

我毕竟搬到纽约了。”你会说：“如果你把我所有问题都解释清楚，我就很乐意相信你”吗？你忘了尺度。你以为我像你……这种狂妄。再给你一个：你知道种族主义是什么吗？种族主义就是：把文化差异赋予道德意义。

我们就这么说吧：白人种族主义不是唯一的种族主义，但它确实很突出。所以让我先“挑我们白人”一下，好吗？好，白人做什么？尤其是北欧类型的人——像我们这种背景，英国、德国之类。我们看见某些族群更情绪化。

所以他们快乐时更情绪化；他们悲伤时也更情绪化。你看到会有什么感觉？你会说：“他们是不是有点失控了？他们不一样……”但你在内心深处把自己的差异赋予道德优越，把他们的差异赋予道德劣势。他们也会对我们做同样的事，我知道。但重点是：

什么是白人种族主义？它是在说：“我的上帝是白的。我的上帝像我。上帝是白的。”这正是《诗篇》50篇21节所说的：“你以为我恰和你一样。”一切都从那里来。

我们所有的疑惑、所有的愤怒、你看，还有所有的自以为义。再给你一个：你以为上帝在对待时间的态度上像你。你知道，上帝看时间，是一次看见全部。如果你在地球上空很高处往下看密西西比河，密西西比河的所有河段都同样可见，对吧？如果你在河边，你只看见你所在的那一段弯道。

现在，你们很多人会说：“哦，多年前我确实做过这个、做过那个、做过那些事；它们不好；但我已经过去了。上帝当然不会再拿这事对付我。”朋友们，上帝对时间的态度是这样的：你记得很久以前的那件事，祂现在正在看见；它仍然在发生，仍在祂鼻端。这就是上帝之所以是公义之神的原因。

这就是上帝为什么从不“翻篇”的原因。这就是为什么必须有赎罪，必须有惩罚。你说：“我不信一个会审判的上帝。”你就是以为祂像你。你以为：因为你做过的那些可怕事，在当时你觉得非常非常内疚，也伤害了很多人；但现在一年过去了，两年过去了，十年过去了，它不再困扰你——所以也不该困扰上帝。“你以为我恰和你一样。”

我们所有的问题都从这里来。因为我们的上帝变小了：我们把祂做小，我们把祂做得可管理；我们把我们不喜欢的东西剪掉——“哦，我不能再信这个了；我不能再信那个了。”我们就这样把祂削小了。结果，我们也被削小了：我们没有伟大，我们没有自由。

你有没有意识到：如果你真的接纳伊丽莎白所说的那位上帝——一位无限的上帝，祂的旨意无限地、无法度量地超越你对“祂在做什么”的任何想象——如果你说：“我接纳它；我拥抱它。”你就会自由，完全自由；再没有任何事能搅扰你。若你说：“我不再试图顺服上帝，好让祂对我好，好让祂给我想要的东西——地位、婚姻、我想要的东西。”相反，你若说：

“我不再用祂来换取那些让我生命有意义的东西，而是：祂就是我生命的意义。”如果你真的让祂成为你生命的意义，如果祂是终极，而不是一个达成目的的小手段——不是你学会操控来得到你想要之物的工具。

若祂是你生命的意义——换句话说，若祂是大的，你就会大。若祂在你眼里是伟大的，你就会有一颗伟大的心。你会以一种“伟大”的方式走过人生；你不会总是害怕、烦躁，被环境到处打得东倒西歪。正因如此，《纳尼亚传奇》——C.S. 路易斯写的那些童话——里有一个小地方。

它出现得太快，你甚至不会注意到它的重要性，但它极其耐人寻味：小露西遇见亚斯兰——也就是耶稣——祂是一只狮子。她在第二本书里遇见祂，她说：“亚斯兰，终于见到你了，欢迎，孩子。”祂说：“露西，你长大了。”她说：“那是因为我年纪更大了呀，小孩子。”

“不是因为你更大了吗？”“不是。你越长大，越成长，你就会发现我更大。”祂在说什么？它一闪而过，你甚至不会停下来想一想。

路易斯在说：你的上帝越大，你就越大。你越让上帝成为上帝，你越不把祂当作达到目的的手段，而把祂当作目的本身——不是那个必须回答你所有问题的人。你越把祂放在祂应有的尺度上，你就越会有一颗伟大的心。可怎么可能呢？

怎么可能？到底如何？你知道吗？基督徒通常会做的事——我告诉你，多年来，我以前常常在这里结束我的讲道。我会说：“那现在呢？”

我知道。我翻看了过去一些类似的讲道，这几周我一直在看。我会说：去研究上帝的属性。思想祂的圣洁。

思想祂的威严。思想祂的智慧。不要把祂削小。接纳圣经对祂所说的一切。这条诫命——祂说“不可为我造雕刻的形像”——是什么意思？

祂的意思是：不要把我想象成你想要的样子，而要照我本来的样子敬拜我。所以这意味着什么？接纳祂所说的。但你知道吗？当我研究——当我只是研究祂的圣洁，只是研究祂的威严，只是研究祂的智慧——我感觉不到自己变得更伟大，也感觉不到自己变得更大。

它开始压垮我，也会压垮你。亚斯兰对露西所说的那种动力，我完全感受不到；它只会让我越来越糟，越来越糟，越来越糟。我会觉得：“哦，天哪，这是上帝；我只能硬着头皮忍受。”但答案在这里：第6节说，一切的原因是“那时没有王”。你看见了吗？

它说：这一切愚蠢、这一切小气、这一切狭小的根源，是因为那时以色列没有王。作者在说什么？他说：没有救主。我们需要比这些士师更好的东西。我们需要一位王。

可是当你得到王，即便是最好的王——大卫——我们也看见他仍需要一位救主。这里指向的很简单：为什么上帝说“不要造像”？为什么在当时，以色列几乎是地上唯一的宗教——几乎“发明”了这种做法——

就是：当你走进圣殿，进入至圣所，进入内殿，甚至走到约柜面前——那是上帝的宝座——有基路伯，就是天使，面向里面；而就在你以为会看见一个形像、一个可触摸的东西、一个你可以抓住的东西、一个可接近的东西的地方——对吧？我们是有身体的受造物；我们会尝、会触、会听、会看、会闻；我们想看见什么、想摸到什么——就在那儿，什么都没有。上帝说：“你们不要在那里放一个像。”

“我的宝座是空的。”我们就得忍受一位抽象、不可见的上帝：摸不到，看不见，闻不到。上帝却说：“不，不，不，不，你们绝不可以在那儿放像——但不是因为将来永远不会有一个像。”《歌罗西书》1章15节有一句惊人的话：“他（耶稣基督）是那不能看见之上帝的像；万有都是借着他造的，无论是宝座、或执政的、掌权的、或有位的、或主治的。”上帝在说什么？上帝在说：“我明白你为什么想要一个像。”

“我明白你为什么想要一个你能抓住的东西；我会给你一个。我会提供那个像；你们不要自己提供像，因为你们试图为我造的任何一个像——为了让我变得‘你能与之相处’——只会把我变得更小、更小，也会把你变得更小。但我会给你真正的像，一个活的像：主耶稣基督。祂会如此显明我的荣耀，以致一方面，祂终于成为你可以与之相处的人——一个人类、一个位格——一个会爱、会哭、会拥抱的人；终于是一个成功的人；但同时，祂反而在你心里把我变得比你能想象的更大。”不是更小，而是更大。为什么？因为这位伟大的上帝——你知道，在祂面前，我们不过是微尘，我们不过是尘埃的微粒，我们不过是草履虫，我们不过是变形虫。

没有任何别的“像”能告诉我们：这个“像”做了什么——祂来为我们而死；祂为草履虫而死；祂为变形虫而死。当你拥有一位如此伟大的上帝，以至于祂能成为渺小，你就拥有了一位比你所能想象的更伟大的上帝。没有任何别的宗教有这样的上帝；没有任何别的宗教承认：上帝大到可以成为小。只有当你有这样的上帝，只有当你承认：耶稣基督是上帝的像，并且祂为我而死——那才最终向我显出一种超越我原本所知的一切的伟大；但那伟大并不压垮我。现在我想为祂而活。

现在我不再说：“上帝必须对我好，因为我遵守了所有规则。”因为耶稣就是我的良善。祂就是那一位。我想要的比那更大：祂如今是我生命的意义。你看，上帝不能被收买，但我们可以。祂越大，我们就越大。

让我们祷告。父啊，我们知道主餐之所以如此重要，其中一个原因是：它是有形的，是我们可以拿在手里的东西；它提醒我们：你已经让耶稣基督来到地上，成为我们的像——也就是你的像——成为我们理解你伟大的途径。只有当我们领受祂、记念祂所做的事，你才终于在我们的心思里把你放在你应有的比例与尺度中；而当那发生时，我们就会如此自由。主啊，我们祈求：当我们领受主餐、领受饼和杯时，求你使你自己在我们里面真实起来，也使我们看见你应有的比例与尺度。

求你在我们眼中作你自己；在我们心里作你自己；作你自己，好叫我们终于能作我们自己——成为你在耶稣的名里所造我们成为的样式。阿们。
