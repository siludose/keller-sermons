### Introduction: The Broken World

Why is the world so broken? And why are we capable of inflicting such harm even toward those we love? People point to politics, poverty, or psychology, but none of these fully explain what we see in ourselves and in history. This month on the podcast, Tim Keller is teaching from a series exploring the question, what's wrong with us? Knowing us how the Bible's teaching unsin offers the only explanation deep enough to face the truth in all its complexity, and the only hope powerfully enough to transform us.

### The Story of Achan

Then, Joshua said to Aiken, my son, give glory to the Lord, the God of Israel, and give him the praise, tell me what you have done, do not hide it from me. Aiken replied, it's true, I've sinned against the Lord the God of Israel. This is what I have done. When I saw in the plunder a beautiful robe from Babylonia, 200 shekels of silver and a wedge of gold weighing 50 shekels, I coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent with the silver underneath.

> "They took the things from the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites and spread them out before the Lord."

**Joshua, together with all Israel, took Aiken son of Zira, the silver, the robe, the gold wedge, his sons and daughters, his cattle, donkeys and sheep, his tent and all that he had to the valley of Achor.**

### Understanding Gluttony

The seven deadly sins were cataloged by, especially Thomas Aquinas who was a medieval theologian. And one of the seven deadly sins that he cataloged was the sin of gluttony. Now gluttony in his technical sense, the technical meaning of the word gluttony is to eat and drink immoderately. When food and drink becomes too important to you and you use it immoderately.

- Excessively: demanding too much food.
- Sumptuously: demanding only the richest food.
- Daintily: demanding only the most perfectly prepared food.
- Impulsively: demanding food now, right now.

### The Nature of Craving

Gluttony tells us something about all of us. Gluttony is taking something good, something necessary and cramming it in until we're sick of it until we're ready to explode. Gluttony is a way for us to see that sin has affected our heart so that our desires are disordered.

> "Sin in other words, makes us all addicted to something."

**The spectacular addictions, like alcoholism, like home spectacular, they're obvious, they are just a template for understanding how all of our hearts work in some way.**

### Healing from Craving

First of all, look at the structure, there are four steps. Aiken does not immediately get in the grip of this thing, there's four steps. You see what he does? He says, you know, he says, I have sinned, and he says, I saw in the plunder a beautiful robe from Babylonia, 200 shekels of silver and a wedge of gold weighing 50 shekels. I coveted them and took them.

- **I saw:** The first step of temptation is to move beyond noticing to gazing.
- **I weighed:** The second step is giving them glory, weighing them in your life.
- **I coveted:** Coveting is to worship something, to adore it.
- **I took:** The final step, acting on the craving.

### Conclusion: The True Feast

God calls us glutton to a real feast, the married supper of the lamb, and let me tell you something, when you know there's an incredible dessert coming, you don't eat too much, do you? You eat moderately.

> "Our Father, we ask that you would make us moderate, that you would show us how important it is to have this kind of stability, but the only way we can possibly break the power of beautiful things on our hearts is to see a more beautiful thing."

**Your son is the fairest among 10,000, but especially as he dies on the cross and he's lifted up and he draws us by his beauty, even though he's so broken.**

## 中文翻译

### 引言：破碎的世界

为什么这个世界如此破碎？为什么我们能够对我们所爱的人造成如此大的伤害？人们指向政治、贫穷或心理学，但这些都不能完全解释我们在自己和历史中看到的现象。本月的播客中，Tim Keller 从一个系列中教授，探索这个问题：我们出了什么问题？圣经关于罪的教导提供了唯一足够深刻的解释，能够面对真相的复杂性，并提供唯一足够强大的希望来改变我们。

### 亚干的故事

然后，约书亚对亚干说，我的儿子，要归荣耀给耶和华以色列的神，向他认罪，把你所做的事告诉我，不要隐瞒。亚干回答说，确实如此，我得罪了耶和华以色列的神。这是我所做的事。我在掠物中看到一件美丽的巴比伦袍子，二百舍客勒银子和一块重五十舍客勒的金子，我就贪恋这些东西，把它们拿走了。它们藏在我帐篷里的地里，银子在下面。

> "他们从帐篷里拿出这些东西，带到约书亚和以色列众人面前，摆在耶和华面前。"

**约书亚和以色列众人把谢拉的儿子亚干、银子、袍子、金子、他的儿女、牛、驴、羊、帐篷和他所有的一切都带到亚割谷。**

### 理解贪食

七宗罪是由中世纪神学家托马斯·阿奎那特别编纂的，其中之一就是贪食罪。贪食在技术意义上是指过度饮食和饮酒。当食物和饮料对你变得过于重要并且你不加节制地使用它们时。

- 过度：要求过多的食物。
- 奢华：只要求最丰富的食物。
- 精致：只要求最完美准备的食物。
- 冲动：现在就要求食物。

### 欲望的本质

贪食告诉我们一些关于我们所有人的事情。贪食是把一些好的、必要的东西塞进来，直到我们厌倦它，直到我们准备爆炸。贪食是让我们看到罪如何影响我们的心，使我们的欲望变得无序。

> "换句话说，罪使我们都对某些东西上瘾。"

**显而易见的成瘾，如酗酒，如家庭显而易见，它们只是理解我们所有人心灵运作方式的模板。**

### 从欲望中得医治

首先，看看结构，有四个步骤。亚干并不是立即陷入这种情况，而是有四个步骤。你看他做了什么？他说，我犯了罪，他说，我在掠物中看到一件美丽的巴比伦袍子，二百舍客勒银子和一块重五十舍客勒的金子。我贪恋这些东西，就拿走了。

- **我看见了：** 诱惑的第一步是从注意到凝视。
- **我衡量了：** 第二步是给予它们荣耀，在你的生活中衡量它们。
- **我贪恋了：** 贪恋是崇拜某物，爱慕它。
- **我拿走了：** 最后一步，付诸行动。

### 结论：真正的盛宴

神呼召我们这些贪食者参加真正的盛宴，羔羊的婚宴，让我告诉你，当你知道有一个令人难以置信的甜点即将到来时，你不会吃得太多，对吗？你会适度地吃。

> "我们的父，我们请求你使我们适度，向我们展示拥有这种稳定性的重要性，但我们唯一可能打破美丽事物在我们心中力量的方法是看到更美丽的事物。"

**你的儿子是万中选一的最美，但特别是当他在十字架上死去并被高举时，他以他的美丽吸引我们，尽管他如此破碎。**
