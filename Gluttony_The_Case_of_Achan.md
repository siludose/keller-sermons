## English Transcript / 英文原文

today. And they all Israel stone him and after they stone the rest, they burn them. And this is the Lord speaking, talking about Israel. I will punish her for the day she burned incense to the veils. She decked herself with rings and jewelry and went after her lovers.

But may she forgot to clear the Lord. Therefore, I am now going to allure her. I will lead her into the desert and speak tenderly to her. Therefore I will give her back her vineyards and I will make the valley of a core, a door  of hope. There she will sing as in the days of her youth, as in the days she came up from Egypt.

And this is God's word. You know, the seven deadly sins were cataloged by, especially Thomas Aquinas who was a medieval  theologian. And one of the seven deadly sins that he cataloged was the sin of gluttony. Now gluttony in his technical sense, the technical meaning of the word gluttony is to eat and drink  immoderately. When food and drink becomes too important to you and you use it immoderately.

And the moral theologians of the Middle Ages discerned several forms of gluttony. They said that you can eat and drink excessively, you can eat and drink sumptuously, daintily  or impulsively. And those are different kinds of gluttony. So first of all, you have excessively, that means demanding too much food. And you can also eat sumptuously which is demanding only the richest food.

And you can eat daintily which meant to demand only the most perfectly prepared food just  so. And you can eat impulsively which is to demand food now, right now. And you know, it's hard in New York City to avoid the sin of gluttony. There's no other place where you don't just have food at every corner. You have food at your, and you can smell it, of course, right at your elbow, everywhere  you move.

And of course, especially the category of daintiness, the gluttony of the dainty category, very  hard because if you've lived in New York for a while and you go visit from friends somewhere  else in the country, you know, it starts a dawn on you that the best restaurant in Cleveland  is only as good as your corner deli here. And you start to say, oh yeah, it's all right, you know, and you start to become daintie. Now we laugh. In fact, we might laugh very patronizingly at the entire category of gluttony, but we  stop laughing when we reflect on two things when we think of two things. Number one, the medieval moral theologians were onto alcoholism and eating disorders well  before modern psychology.

They understood there's something wrong here, but let me go a little further. You know, every week you go over one of the seven deadly sins and there's a sense in which  each sin on the surface behaviorally is different. And so you can go through the seven deadly sins in a series of sermons like we're doing  or in a series of chapters and you will feel that some of them nail you more than others  because some of them are more your problem than others and that of course makes sense. And yet in another sense, if you look beneath, if you look at the hard attitudes, the seven  deadly sins are really like holding up a black diamond. And as you turn the black diamond, you know, you see a different facet, but every facet  is just another way of looking down into the same heart of darkness.

And so every single sin shows us something about how sin infects and affects all of us. And this is what gluttony says to us.  gluttony tells us something about all of us.  gluttony is taking something good, something necessary and cramming it in until we're sick  of it until we're ready to explode.  gluttony is a way for us to see that sin has affected our heart so that our desires are  disordered. Our desires are disordered in such a way that good and necessary things become cravings,  become yearnings. Saint Augustine gave it a word. He said, we're all characterized.

Sin has done this to us. We're all characterized by what he called concupacence, but a great word. You know, from the Latin Cupera, which means desire, in fact, we have the word cupid,  the god cupid, which had to do with the god of one particular kind of desire, but concupacence  meant there's an infection, there's a disorder. Our desires have been disordered in such a way that good and necessary things now drive  us and we crave them. We did another way.

The opposite of gluttony is self-control. And since all of us have self-control somewhere, since all of us have self-control problems somewhere,  we all have a place in which our desires are disordered. Sin in other words, makes us all addicted to something. The spectacular addictions, like alcoholism, like home spectacular, they're obvious,  they are just a template for understanding how all of our hearts work in some way. And that is what this teaches us about.

We are all in the grip of craving. We all crave something and we do it in such a way as I'm going to show you that it is  very, very bad for us. Now, let's just take a look and see what this teaches us, about three kinds of craving. You know, our hearts are filled with such demandingness and craving at some point. That's sin that does it.

And the three things we see, let's learn these three things. The depth of our craving, the structure of our craving, and the healing. We learn the depth of our craving, the structure of our craving, and the healing of our craving. First of all, let's look at the depth of the craving. When Joshua comes to Akin, it says, my son, give glory to the Lord, the God of Israel,  and give him the praise.

Tell me what you have done. Do not hide it from me. And Akin says, it's true. There's a remarkable thing going on here. And I know when I first read it and you see Akin and all of his cattle and all of his family  being stoned and burned and there was a kind of, this is Manhattan, you know, this is  one of those places in the Bible where things happen that we all know now.

We're wrong and terrible. Well, listen, Akin knew exactly what he'd done. You don't see Akin saying, oh my gosh, you mean this is a capital offense? You mean you're going to do this? You're going to do what?

Oh, no. He says, you got me. Listen, when God took the children of Israel out of Egypt and moved them to Canaan, to their  promised land, as they took that land through conquest, he lay down a rule. And that rule went like this. He says, you are not just any old bloodthirsty pirate nation.

This is the way other nations are. You will not be this way. You are not coming into Canaan to satisfy the desire for the increase of national power. And secondly, you're not coming into Canaan to satisfy your own personal desire to increase  your private wealth. Oh, no.

You're not pirates. You're not here to plunder. You are coming to the land that I promised to Abraham Isaac and Jacob. It's yours and there I'm going to dwell with you. So whenever you come and you take a city, all of the money, all of the wealth of that  city, you must never take it as booty.

You must never see it as plunder. That goes to building a tabernacle and later on a temple, which will be a house of worship  for the all of the people and in which I will dwell in your midst. And therefore no one has ever conquered like that. There's never been a country like that. There's never been a nation that conquered like that.

He says, you're not doing it out of an imperialistic desire for expansion. You're not doing it out of a desire to just materially increase yourself. Oh, no. And as a result, he lay down this. You never take the possessions of the conquered people, never.

And you see, that was critical to the very identity as a people. That was critical to the legitimacy of the whole campaign and it was absolutely critical  to the honor of God. And the rule was laid down and everybody knew it was a capital offense. I'll be with you as long as you don't do that. And as long as they didn't do that, he was with them and they had success in their campaign.

Everybody knew about that rule. Everybody knew why it was so serious. Everybody knew that it was at the heart of the honor of God. God did not just say, oh, look it, you're my people. So I just want you to go and plunder and slaughter everybody else.

This was absolutely critical to their self-understanding, critical to the morality and the legitimacy  of the campaign, critical to the glory of God. So when Agen saw what he saw, we're going to see in a minute. His heart so coveted those things that he took him anyway. He knew what he was doing. He knew how bad it was.

He knew how serious the consequences were going to be one way or the other. And when he was caught, he said, yeah, yeah, I did it. He didn't say, what? What? You're going to what?

Oh no. He knew. And what is the point? I'll tell you what the point is. Our craving, our hearts desire for things, is so strong that it overcomes our conscience,  that it overcomes our understanding, our reason, eventually it will overcome your fear of consequences  and even your own sense of self-preservation.

Sin so affects you that there are some things that you must have and that you will crave  and you will crave them so much that you will take them even to the degree that to get  them is to lose everything Agen did. That's what craving is. The heart makes you want some things so much. It's suicidal to get them. To even get them always ends up meaning you lose everything, but you have to get it anyway.

That's how bad it is. The sin affects our hearts in such a way that the most basic part of our heart is not  our reason. It's not our conscience. It's not our even our instinct for self-preservation. We'll get what things we want, whether or not it means we lose everything in the end.

You know, in CS Lewis's first fairy tale of the Chronicles of Narnia, in that story,  the witch gives Edmund some Turkish delight and it's enchanted and this is what he says  about it. Anyone who had ever once tasted this Turkish delight would want more and more and would  even, if allowed, go on eating it till they killed themselves. That's a picture of the way the human heart latches on to things. We all latch on to something like that. Remember, some of you were here last week, I'm sure, in Numbers chapter 11, we're told  that the children of Israel had been going through the wilderness and God had been given  the manna to eat a bread stuff, but they wanted meat.

Well, it's okay to want meat, but they felt the old King James says they fell a lusting  for meat. And God says, I'll give you meat, but because you're craving it, and if you go back to  the chapter we looked at last week and you go down to verse 20 and 21, there's an amazing  statement where God says, I'll give you meat and you will eat it and you will eat it until  it comes out of your nostrils and you come to loathe it. The nature of this craving that our hearts have, sin makes us desire some things to the place  where we want it beyond what's good for us. We want it beyond reason, beyond conscience. We do it no matter what.

A hypochondriac, let me give you an easy example, and I'll show you some of them. A hypochondriac is somebody who wants health so much and so afraid of losing it that they  lose it. They don't go outside. They're afraid of being infected as a result. What's the best way to stay healthy?

Sunshine, fresh air, but in these days and he's so afraid of losing it that he loses it. When I was in high school in college, I really wanted to be good at playing the trumpet. I was fairly good at playing the trumpet, but I wanted so desperately to be good that whenever  I went to an audition in high school in college, I finally gave up on music partly because  of this. Whenever I would go to an audition, I would be absolutely petrified. I could not hardly keep the mouthpiece on my lips.

I'd be trembling. Sometimes I'd be crying during the audition because I was that scared. I was so afraid of losing it that I always lost it. Over the years, I don't know how many times I've counseled spouses who are so afraid of  losing their spouse, that they lost their spouse. They were so jealous, so they were so dependent.

You can go on and on. Who are the kids? I mean, see, I'm going from the very serious to the sublime, but you see, this is the  way craving works. Who are the kids who never had any friends in school? Remember who they were?

They were the kids that wanted the friends so badly. They'd come after you like a puppy. If you even showed them some interest, they would say, oh, good, you want to be my friend. Get away from me, you would think, you know? It's the people who most wanted friends who never had friends.

They were so afraid. They wanted them so badly, they never got it. They were so afraid of losing it, they were always losing them. There are things that we crave, and because we crave them, we crave them out of proportion. It hurts us now.

One of the things that's a little hard to talk about here is to point out that it's  easier when you're kind of craving or addicted to very concrete things. There's people here, for example, this is New York, so I'm sure there's people here  who are addicted to nice concrete things like there's various sorts of sexual addictions,  liaisons or pornography or something like that. There's gambling, there's drink, there's eating disorders, and in some ways, you know,  hypochondra I mentioned that in some ways, those are a little easier to at least deal with. You know they're there, they're concrete, they're visible, they're physical in many cases. But what about the rest of us?

Will you listen? Most of the time when you're the most depressed, most of the time when you're the most discouraged,  most of the time when you're the most in the fit of rage, look at yourself. And here's what you're going to find. The reason you're so discouraged, the reason you're in such despair, the reason you're  so petrified, the reason that you're in such a grip is because there's something in  your life, and very often it's not all that physical, not all that tangible. There's something in your life that you want immoderately.

If you could be moderate about it, if you could say, she I'd like to have that, she  would be a great thing, but you know, it's not that critical. If you could say that about it, you wouldn't be in despair, you might be disappointed. You wouldn't be in bitterness, you might just be irritated, you know. You wouldn't be petrified, you'd be worried. But it's because it's not immoderate, because you've got to have, because it's the craving  at the bottom of almost all of our discouragements, at the bottom of almost all of our deepest  difficulties is this.

Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache. We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way, and what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing this month, What Is Wrong With The World, Tim Keller  offers a clear and compassionate answer. Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer, Dr.

Keller shows how the reality  of sin explains the pain we see all around us, and how only the gospel offers lasting  freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes  or choices, or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world will help you see  how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us. This newly released book What Is Wrong With The World is our thanks for your gift this  month to help gospel and life share the good news of Jesus.

And that's the reason why you can never make a decision, and that's the reason why your  life is stuck. Because you've got to have certainty, and you won't make a move unless you have it,  and therefore you never make a move because you can't ever find it. You're addicted to it, or achievement, some of that's the reason why some of you work  yourselves into oblivion, or independence, the reason why many of you are afraid of  a commitment, or you know, I'm afraid of dependence, that's the reason why you can never  get it, because you so desperately want some by the minute you begin dating them, they  can just feel the vacuum cleaner of your heart. These things are, yeah, I know that, you know, that didn't mean it to be funny, you  know, sermons moving on is getting near the end, it's a serious, and it's hard to see. And yet, Agen committed suicide.

He knew what the things were, he knew it was going on, he did it anyway, he had to have  it so much, he lost everything. And that's because that is what sin does to the heart. That takes good in this, good desires, and it disorders them to come to cupasins. Now, what are the principles for getting out? First you have to understand the structure, you can take a look and see how Agen fell into  it, and then secondly you have to see the basic principles for the healing.

And I must tell you that there's basically the same, even though I don't want anybody  to think that in every situation your craving doesn't have particular issues that have to  be addressed, as well as the general ones that I'm going to mention now. I don't think that the general ones I'm going to mention would ever be enough to deal  with any particular craving, because every craving has both particular and general aspects  to it. But I'm going to lay out that which we all have got to deal with if we're going to not  be overwhelmed by the temptations that come because of our cravings. First of all, look at the structure, there are four steps. Agen does not immediately get in the grip of this thing, there's four steps.

You see what he does? He says, you know, he says, I have sinned, and he says, I saw in the plunder a beautiful  road from Babylonia, 200 checkles of silver and a wedge of gold weighing 50 checkles. I coveted them and took them. Now look, first he says, I saw. This is how temptation works.

The word saw is not a Hebrew word that would mean notice. It's the word that's usually translated, behold. You know, whenever in the Old Testament you have the word behold, what does it mean to  behold something? It doesn't mean just to notice something. It means look, look, look.

Behold means to hold it, put it in the center of your attention, consider it, gaze at it. And you notice the first step in temptation is not coveting. In fact, I'm going to show you that's the third step. The first step of temptation is to move beyond noticing to gazing. The first step in temptation is when you put yourself open to a forbidden thing, not  even planning to get it, not even wanting it yet, but just opening yourself to stay there,  to be in a place where it can happen.

You can't help but notice things because all the good things, you know, that become  confupacence for you, are good things. You can't help but notice them, but the gaze, that's the first step, just being open, just  being able to look at a forbidden thing to you without recoiling is the first step. You already entered in. Then the second step, I saw it and said, I'd be held, but then the second step, I weighed. Now, he said, where does it say that?

Well, that's a paraphrase, that's a summary, but look what he says. What did he see? A beautiful robe from Babylonia, 200 shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold. How did he know how many shekels were in that bag? Well, I noticed there were 200 shekels.

How do you notice there's 200 shekels? You know, it's one thing to notice five. You can notice five, but you can't notice 200. You've got a gaze, and you've got a count, and you've got to weigh it. How does he know how much the gold weighs?

Now, here's what he's doing, the theological term for what he's doing is he was giving them glory. In Hebrew, the word glory had both a physical and a spiritual connotation. In Hebrew, the word glory means literally and physically weight, but spiritually it meant  importance. And the reason those two things have the same, the word can be used in those two ways,  the same thing as the word matter. The English word matter can mean something that's weighty, but it can also mean something  of importance.

I remember I went to school to college in Central Pennsylvania, and the summer after I graduated  from college, the Susquehanna River overflowed its banks during Hurricane Agnes, and just  wiped out all kinds of little towns. I went back to the town I went to school, and I noticed that a lot of things were swept  away, but the things that weren't swept away were the things that were anchored, the things  that were rooted, the things that were weighty, the monuments, the stone houses, but an  awful lot of other houses were swept away. Now, here is the second stage of temptation, the thing that waits something in your life,  so that it is not swept away, so it becomes central, so it sticks, so it has impact is  your imagination. It's your imagination. Sin is always an inflammation of the imagination.

Your imagination is that which gives glory to something, it's your imagination which looks  at the beauty of it and thinks about it, and it fondles it on the palette of your soul. The imagination is the tongue of your soul, the palette. He knew about the honor of God, he knew about the honor of his people, and he also knew  how wonderful these things were, but what he did was he set his imagination not on God and  not on his people, but he set his imagination on these things, these beautiful things. In other words, one of the ways some of you may be heard me say it, he knew about the  honor of God and the honor of his people, but he put that on audio, but he put these material  possessions on video. He let his senses be captivated by them.

He gave them glory, and whatever you give glory to you serve, whatever you ascribe the  most glory to, and this is a discipline of the mind, and he did it, and as a result,  the third step is, I coveted them, well okay, I gazed at them, I weighed them, of course  by now I coveted them, what is coveting? Is to worship something, coveting is to adore something, because whatever you glorify,  you will worship, you'll feel drawn to it. His heart was inflamed now, and there's really virtually no stopping it because in the  fourth step is, I took them. In other words, what craving does to you, we might think that I can't stop it, but you see  this is slow motion, this is great, this is what's great about this verse, it shows us  in slow motion, that what craving does, craving knows that there is a glory-fying apparatus  in the center of your being, and it takes it over, and therefore drives your life. Now how do we heal ourselves from it, that's the question then, okay, if that's how it  works, if that's how the craving works, in fact you can see there's even stages there,  how are we healed from it.

For some of you, this is very, very practical, some of you right now have a real problem  with self-control in certain areas, sometimes it's very, very physical, is it not a particular  sexual problem, a particular physical problem, a particular substance abuse. For others of us it's, you know, this desire, this desperate desire just to be loved,  and as a result our lives are being run by it, we want it so much that you see our lives  are being run by it, how do we get healed? I said in a sense there's three steps before you take it, I gazed, I wade, I coveted,  and I took, at any one of those three places you can break the chain, you can, you know,  you can get off the road, you can get, there's always, there's an exit ramp just before every  one of these toll booths, and here's the way, here's the way they work, and after the  service, if there's anybody who wants to go in a more detail on them, I have a question  answer time downstairs, but I'll just outline them now. The first one is number one, be aware of what you're gazing at, so just notice these things  don't gaze at them, and you know, people who, be aware what you're gazing at, nip it in  the bud, don't let your mind, don't be in a situation where these things can happen. Now that's maybe too easy, so I'll move right along, people in 12 step programs have  already gotten on to that, right?

They get together, and they hold each other accountable, don't go to those places, don't  think about those things, don't pay through those books, you know, cut up your credit  cards, whatever they do, depending on your craving, but you know, those of us who don't  have that kind of nice physical concupissance, we've also got to say, realize what you're  looking at during the day, realize where your gaze is, Archbishop William Temple said, use  the solitude test, he says, your religion is what you do with your solitude, whatever,  when you don't have to think of anything else, do you think about it? What is it that you comfort yourself with, where do your thoughts go to most effortlessly,  he says, that's your God, that's worship, proportion, craving? I have another test, I called the unanswered prayer test, what would you say to God about,  what would you say to God, Lord, if you do this to me, or if you refuse to give this to  me, we're through? And if you've got anything like that, and most of us do, whatever that is is more important  in God, and that is a worship sized thing, that is craving. So realize that you are gazing at things, notice them, but don't gaze at them, don't be  in a place where it can happen, okay, but then the second, the only, see, the first is  negative, stay away, stop it, turn your mind away, don't think about it, have accountability,  call your friend, call your buddy up, but the negative will not be enough.

In Hebrews chapter 12, it doesn't just say, let us run the race before us, casting off  every sin and every weight that entangles, it doesn't just stop there, it says, and  as fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfect of our faith. Thomas Chalmers in the early 19th century was a Scotsman, he was a pastor, and he was also  a Thaithman, and he lived in Edinburgh, and he was very upset with the poverty that he  saw in certain parts of the city, and he worked with these people, and he found many  of them had these life-dominating habits, and as a result of that work, he wrote a  fascinating chapter, which was originally a sermon, and he called it the expulsive power  of a new affection, and he said there, this, he said, the only way you can ever release  the soul from the power of a beautiful object is to give it a more beautiful object. He says, there's no way you can simply say, turn your mind away from the beautiful object  on which you're fixed. The only way to break the power of a beautiful object on your heart is to give it a more  beautiful object, and that's the reason why John Dunn put it this way. He spoke to the Lord, and he says, take me to you, imprison me, for I accept you and  you throw me, never shall be free, nor ever chased, except you ravish me.

What a risqué thing to say. I, he says, and throw me, take me to you, and prison me, because if you don't imprison  me, I'll be imprisoned by something else, and if you don't ravish me, I'll be ravished  by something else. What is it? The heart. Look it, look it, look it.

It's the beautiful thing that you've got to learn in the disciplines of worship and  the disciplines of your soul, in the disciplines of your heart, not just to believe in in some  general way, but to be ravished by. He is the beautiful thing. He is the new affection which has an expulsive power. Are you addicted to certainty? Well, the only certainty you really have is that Jesus loves you if you belong to him,  and it's the only one you need, and all other certainties won't have that power over  you.

Are you addicted to achievement? Well, the only verdict and honor you really have, if you're a Christian, is that Jesus  says, you are my beloved child in whom I'm well pleased, and it's the only one you need. If you think about it, and you know, most of the counselors will tell you, addictions  are ways for people to numb themselves and anesthetize themselves who don't think they  matter. You don't think you matter. Here's the ultimate cure for that.

Why would Jesus Christ die for you? Do you remember some years ago, an airplane crashed into the water in winter time at Washington,  D.C., and one man kept diving back into safe people, remember that? And he dove into safe people, and finally, last time he dove into safe one more person  and he didn't make it. And finally, they found his body, and I remember on the TV watching as they hoisted it up  and lifted it out of the water. And as he was lifted up, the people whose lives had been saved, just looked at him.

What did they think? One lady on camera said, why did he do that for me? Jesus Christ says, when I am lifted up, I will draw all men to myself. And John 12, and John says, he adds in parenthesis, thereby he showed what kind of death he  would die. When he was lifted up, why would he do that for you?

Why would he do that for you? The answer is, you matter. And don't you see the irony of the Christian gospel? The gospel is, you come to Jesus and you say, Lord Jesus, I give you all the glory. I can't possibly be good enough for the Father to accept me, but because you died for  me, because you live for me, I ascribe all glory to you, and I ask that God would save  me for your sake.

I receive you as my Savior. When you say that, and you give him all the glory, paradoxically, you get more glory  than you can bear, because you come to see that you matter enough that he died for you,  and that you matter to the only one in the universe whose opinion matters. And so Lewis himself says, to please God, to be a real ingredient in his joy, to be loved  by God, not just pitied, but delighted in as an artist delights in a work, or as a parent  in a child, as a weight of glory, our thoughts can hardly sustain, but so it is. Now, there's a third thing you have to do. If you actually get to the coveting stage and you actually take it, you repent.

And if your life is falling apart because it's gone too far, God says, I can make the  valley of Acorn, Acore, the door of hope. You may have already been stoned and burned, because you may have gone on to the place where  your craving has destroyed your life, you think, no, says God, no. I tell you, if you repent and come back, and learn to be ravaged with my son, and learn  to watch where you gaze, I tell you, I can rebuild you from the ground up. I can make the valley of Acore, a door of hope. Listen.

God calls us glutton to a real feast, the married supper of the lamb, and let me tell you  something, when you know there's an incredible dessert coming, you don't eat too much,  do you? You eat moderately. What do you say? You say, no, thank you. I don't want anymore.

That was really good. I don't want anymore. I'm saving some room for dessert, come and see what that is, let's pray. Our Father, we ask that you would make us moderate, that you would show us how important  it is to have this kind of stability, but the only way we can possibly break the power  of beautiful things on our hearts is to see a more beautiful thing. Your son is the fairest among 10,000, but especially as he dies on the cross and he's lifted  up and he draws us by his beauty, even though he's so broken.

It's a beautiful brokenness because it's for us. Let us be so ravished by the thoughts of those things, let us be so good at repentance,  let us be so good at watching how we look at things that we find ourselves no longer  in the grip of these cravings, but rather waiting for the marriage of the Lamb, eating moderately  and enjoying all good things here, for we ask it in Jesus' name. Amen.

today. And they all Israel stone him and after they stone the rest, they burn them. And this is the Lord speaking, talking about Israel. I will punish her for the day she burned incense to the veils. She decked herself with rings and jewelry and went after her lovers.

But may she forgot to clear the Lord. Therefore, I am now going to allure her. I will lead her into the desert and speak tenderly to her. Therefore I will give her back her vineyards and I will make the valley of a core, a door  of hope. There she will sing as in the days of her youth, as in the days she came up from Egypt.

And this is God's word. You know, the seven deadly sins were cataloged by, especially Thomas Aquinas who was a medieval  theologian. And one of the seven deadly sins that he cataloged was the sin of gluttony. Now gluttony in his technical sense, the technical meaning of the word gluttony is to eat and drink  immoderately. When food and drink becomes too important to you and you use it immoderately.

And the moral theologians of the Middle Ages discerned several forms of gluttony. They said that you can eat and drink excessively, you can eat and drink sumptuously, daintily  or impulsively. And those are different kinds of gluttony. So first of all, you have excessively, that means demanding too much food. And you can also eat sumptuously which is demanding only the richest food.

And you can eat daintily which meant to demand only the most perfectly prepared food just  so. And you can eat impulsively which is to demand food now, right now. And you know, it's hard in New York City to avoid the sin of gluttony. There's no other place where you don't just have food at every corner. You have food at your, and you can smell it, of course, right at your elbow, everywhere  you move.

And of course, especially the category of daintiness, the gluttony of the dainty category, very  hard because if you've lived in New York for a while and you go visit from friends somewhere  else in the country, you know, it starts a dawn on you that the best restaurant in Cleveland  is only as good as your corner deli here. And you start to say, oh yeah, it's all right, you know, and you start to become daintie. Now we laugh. In fact, we might laugh very patronizingly at the entire category of gluttony, but we  stop laughing when we reflect on two things when we think of two things. Number one, the medieval moral theologians were onto alcoholism and eating disorders well  before modern psychology.

They understood there's something wrong here, but let me go a little further. You know, every week you go over one of the seven deadly sins and there's a sense in which  each sin on the surface behaviorally is different. And so you can go through the seven deadly sins in a series of sermons like we're doing  or in a series of chapters and you will feel that some of them nail you more than others  because some of them are more your problem than others and that of course makes sense. And yet in another sense, if you look beneath, if you look at the hard attitudes, the seven  deadly sins are really like holding up a black diamond. And as you turn the black diamond, you know, you see a different facet, but every facet  is just another way of looking down into the same heart of darkness.

And so every single sin shows us something about how sin infects and affects all of us. And this is what gluttony says to us.  gluttony tells us something about all of us.  gluttony is taking something good, something necessary and cramming it in until we're sick  of it until we're ready to explode.  gluttony is a way for us to see that sin has affected our heart so that our desires are  disordered. Our desires are disordered in such a way that good and necessary things become cravings,  become yearnings. Saint Augustine gave it a word. He said, we're all characterized.

Sin has done this to us. We're all characterized by what he called concupacence, but a great word. You know, from the Latin Cupera, which means desire, in fact, we have the word cupid,  the god cupid, which had to do with the god of one particular kind of desire, but concupacence  meant there's an infection, there's a disorder. Our desires have been disordered in such a way that good and necessary things now drive  us and we crave them. We did another way.

The opposite of gluttony is self-control. And since all of us have self-control somewhere, since all of us have self-control problems somewhere,  we all have a place in which our desires are disordered. Sin in other words, makes us all addicted to something. The spectacular addictions, like alcoholism, like home spectacular, they're obvious,  they are just a template for understanding how all of our hearts work in some way. And that is what this teaches us about.

We are all in the grip of craving. We all crave something and we do it in such a way as I'm going to show you that it is  very, very bad for us. Now, let's just take a look and see what this teaches us, about three kinds of craving. You know, our hearts are filled with such demandingness and craving at some point. That's sin that does it.

And the three things we see, let's learn these three things. The depth of our craving, the structure of our craving, and the healing. We learn the depth of our craving, the structure of our craving, and the healing of our craving. First of all, let's look at the depth of the craving. When Joshua comes to Akin, it says, my son, give glory to the Lord, the God of Israel,  and give him the praise.

Tell me what you have done. Do not hide it from me. And Akin says, it's true. There's a remarkable thing going on here. And I know when I first read it and you see Akin and all of his cattle and all of his family  being stoned and burned and there was a kind of, this is Manhattan, you know, this is  one of those places in the Bible where things happen that we all know now.

We're wrong and terrible. Well, listen, Akin knew exactly what he'd done. You don't see Akin saying, oh my gosh, you mean this is a capital offense? You mean you're going to do this? You're going to do what?

Oh, no. He says, you got me. Listen, when God took the children of Israel out of Egypt and moved them to Canaan, to their  promised land, as they took that land through conquest, he lay down a rule. And that rule went like this. He says, you are not just any old bloodthirsty pirate nation.

This is the way other nations are. You will not be this way. You are not coming into Canaan to satisfy the desire for the increase of national power. And secondly, you're not coming into Canaan to satisfy your own personal desire to increase  your private wealth. Oh, no.

You're not pirates. You're not here to plunder. You are coming to the land that I promised to Abraham Isaac and Jacob. It's yours and there I'm going to dwell with you. So whenever you come and you take a city, all of the money, all of the wealth of that  city, you must never take it as booty.

You must never see it as plunder. That goes to building a tabernacle and later on a temple, which will be a house of worship  for the all of the people and in which I will dwell in your midst. And therefore no one has ever conquered like that. There's never been a country like that. There's never been a nation that conquered like that.

He says, you're not doing it out of an imperialistic desire for expansion. You're not doing it out of a desire to just materially increase yourself. Oh, no. And as a result, he lay down this. You never take the possessions of the conquered people, never.

And you see, that was critical to the very identity as a people. That was critical to the legitimacy of the whole campaign and it was absolutely critical  to the honor of God. And the rule was laid down and everybody knew it was a capital offense. I'll be with you as long as you don't do that. And as long as they didn't do that, he was with them and they had success in their campaign.

Everybody knew about that rule. Everybody knew why it was so serious. Everybody knew that it was at the heart of the honor of God. God did not just say, oh, look it, you're my people. So I just want you to go and plunder and slaughter everybody else.

This was absolutely critical to their self-understanding, critical to the morality and the legitimacy  of the campaign, critical to the glory of God. So when Agen saw what he saw, we're going to see in a minute. His heart so coveted those things that he took him anyway. He knew what he was doing. He knew how bad it was.

He knew how serious the consequences were going to be one way or the other. And when he was caught, he said, yeah, yeah, I did it. He didn't say, what? What? You're going to what?

Oh no. He knew. And what is the point? I'll tell you what the point is. Our craving, our hearts desire for things, is so strong that it overcomes our conscience,  that it overcomes our understanding, our reason, eventually it will overcome your fear of consequences  and even your own sense of self-preservation.

Sin so affects you that there are some things that you must have and that you will crave  and you will crave them so much that you will take them even to the degree that to get  them is to lose everything Agen did. That's what craving is. The heart makes you want some things so much. It's suicidal to get them. To even get them always ends up meaning you lose everything, but you have to get it anyway.

That's how bad it is. The sin affects our hearts in such a way that the most basic part of our heart is not  our reason. It's not our conscience. It's not our even our instinct for self-preservation. We'll get what things we want, whether or not it means we lose everything in the end.

You know, in CS Lewis's first fairy tale of the Chronicles of Narnia, in that story,  the witch gives Edmund some Turkish delight and it's enchanted and this is what he says  about it. Anyone who had ever once tasted this Turkish delight would want more and more and would  even, if allowed, go on eating it till they killed themselves. That's a picture of the way the human heart latches on to things. We all latch on to something like that. Remember, some of you were here last week, I'm sure, in Numbers chapter 11, we're told  that the children of Israel had been going through the wilderness and God had been given  the manna to eat a bread stuff, but they wanted meat.

Well, it's okay to want meat, but they felt the old King James says they fell a lusting  for meat. And God says, I'll give you meat, but because you're craving it, and if you go back to  the chapter we looked at last week and you go down to verse 20 and 21, there's an amazing  statement where God says, I'll give you meat and you will eat it and you will eat it until  it comes out of your nostrils and you come to loathe it. The nature of this craving that our hearts have, sin makes us desire some things to the place  where we want it beyond what's good for us. We want it beyond reason, beyond conscience. We do it no matter what.

A hypochondriac, let me give you an easy example, and I'll show you some of them. A hypochondriac is somebody who wants health so much and so afraid of losing it that they  lose it. They don't go outside. They're afraid of being infected as a result. What's the best way to stay healthy?

Sunshine, fresh air, but in these days and he's so afraid of losing it that he loses it. When I was in high school in college, I really wanted to be good at playing the trumpet. I was fairly good at playing the trumpet, but I wanted so desperately to be good that whenever  I went to an audition in high school in college, I finally gave up on music partly because  of this. Whenever I would go to an audition, I would be absolutely petrified. I could not hardly keep the mouthpiece on my lips.

I'd be trembling. Sometimes I'd be crying during the audition because I was that scared. I was so afraid of losing it that I always lost it. Over the years, I don't know how many times I've counseled spouses who are so afraid of  losing their spouse, that they lost their spouse. They were so jealous, so they were so dependent.

You can go on and on. Who are the kids? I mean, see, I'm going from the very serious to the sublime, but you see, this is the  way craving works. Who are the kids who never had any friends in school? Remember who they were?

They were the kids that wanted the friends so badly. They'd come after you like a puppy. If you even showed them some interest, they would say, oh, good, you want to be my friend. Get away from me, you would think, you know? It's the people who most wanted friends who never had friends.

They were so afraid. They wanted them so badly, they never got it. They were so afraid of losing it, they were always losing them. There are things that we crave, and because we crave them, we crave them out of proportion. It hurts us now.

One of the things that's a little hard to talk about here is to point out that it's  easier when you're kind of craving or addicted to very concrete things. There's people here, for example, this is New York, so I'm sure there's people here  who are addicted to nice concrete things like there's various sorts of sexual addictions,  liaisons or pornography or something like that. There's gambling, there's drink, there's eating disorders, and in some ways, you know,  hypochondra I mentioned that in some ways, those are a little easier to at least deal with. You know they're there, they're concrete, they're visible, they're physical in many cases. But what about the rest of us?

Will you listen? Most of the time when you're the most depressed, most of the time when you're the most discouraged,  most of the time when you're the most in the fit of rage, look at yourself. And here's what you're going to find. The reason you're so discouraged, the reason you're in such despair, the reason you're  so petrified, the reason that you're in such a grip is because there's something in  your life, and very often it's not all that physical, not all that tangible. There's something in your life that you want immoderately.

If you could be moderate about it, if you could say, she I'd like to have that, she  would be a great thing, but you know, it's not that critical. If you could say that about it, you wouldn't be in despair, you might be disappointed. You wouldn't be in bitterness, you might just be irritated, you know. You wouldn't be petrified, you'd be worried. But it's because it's not immoderate, because you've got to have, because it's the craving  at the bottom of almost all of our discouragements, at the bottom of almost all of our deepest  difficulties is this.

Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache. We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way, and what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing this month, What Is Wrong With The World, Tim Keller  offers a clear and compassionate answer. Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer, Dr.

Keller shows how the reality  of sin explains the pain we see all around us, and how only the gospel offers lasting  freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes  or choices, or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world will help you see  how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us. This newly released book What Is Wrong With The World is our thanks for your gift this  month to help gospel and life share the good news of Jesus. This is your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash give, that's gospelandlife.com slash  give. And see what's hard is, what happens when you're really addicted to a certainty?

And that's the reason why you can never make a decision, and that's the reason why your  life is stuck. Because you've got to have certainty, and you won't make a move unless you have it,  and therefore you never make a move because you can't ever find it. You're addicted to it, or achievement, some of that's the reason why some of you work  yourselves into oblivion, or independence, the reason why many of you are afraid of  a commitment, or you know, I'm afraid of dependence, that's the reason why you can never  get it, because you so desperately want some by the minute you begin dating them, they  can just feel the vacuum cleaner of your heart. These things are, yeah, I know that, you know, that didn't mean it to be funny, you  know, sermons moving on is getting near the end, it's a serious, and it's hard to see. And yet, Agen committed suicide.

He knew what the things were, he knew it was going on, he did it anyway, he had to have  it so much, he lost everything. And that's because that is what sin does to the heart. That takes good in this, good desires, and it disorders them to come to cupasins. Now, what are the principles for getting out? First you have to understand the structure, you can take a look and see how Agen fell into  it, and then secondly you have to see the basic principles for the healing.

And I must tell you that there's basically the same, even though I don't want anybody  to think that in every situation your craving doesn't have particular issues that have to  be addressed, as well as the general ones that I'm going to mention now. I don't think that the general ones I'm going to mention would ever be enough to deal  with any particular craving, because every craving has both particular and general aspects  to it. But I'm going to lay out that which we all have got to deal with if we're going to not  be overwhelmed by the temptations that come because of our cravings. First of all, look at the structure, there are four steps. Agen does not immediately get in the grip of this thing, there's four steps.

You see what he does? He says, you know, he says, I have sinned, and he says, I saw in the plunder a beautiful  road from Babylonia, 200 checkles of silver and a wedge of gold weighing 50 checkles. I coveted them and took them. Now look, first he says, I saw. This is how temptation works.

The word saw is not a Hebrew word that would mean notice. It's the word that's usually translated, behold. You know, whenever in the Old Testament you have the word behold, what does it mean to  behold something? It doesn't mean just to notice something. It means look, look, look.

Behold means to hold it, put it in the center of your attention, consider it, gaze at it. And you notice the first step in temptation is not coveting. In fact, I'm going to show you that's the third step. The first step of temptation is to move beyond noticing to gazing. The first step in temptation is when you put yourself open to a forbidden thing, not  even planning to get it, not even wanting it yet, but just opening yourself to stay there,  to be in a place where it can happen.

You can't help but notice things because all the good things, you know, that become  confupacence for you, are good things. You can't help but notice them, but the gaze, that's the first step, just being open, just  being able to look at a forbidden thing to you without recoiling is the first step. You already entered in. Then the second step, I saw it and said, I'd be held, but then the second step, I weighed. Now, he said, where does it say that?

Well, that's a paraphrase, that's a summary, but look what he says. What did he see? A beautiful robe from Babylonia, 200 shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold. How did he know how many shekels were in that bag? Well, I noticed there were 200 shekels.

How do you notice there's 200 shekels? You know, it's one thing to notice five. You can notice five, but you can't notice 200. You've got a gaze, and you've got a count, and you've got to weigh it. How does he know how much the gold weighs?

Now, here's what he's doing, the theological term for what he's doing is he was giving them glory. In Hebrew, the word glory had both a physical and a spiritual connotation. In Hebrew, the word glory means literally and physically weight, but spiritually it meant  importance. And the reason those two things have the same, the word can be used in those two ways,  the same thing as the word matter. The English word matter can mean something that's weighty, but it can also mean something  of importance.

I remember I went to school to college in Central Pennsylvania, and the summer after I graduated  from college, the Susquehanna River overflowed its banks during Hurricane Agnes, and just  wiped out all kinds of little towns. I went back to the town I went to school, and I noticed that a lot of things were swept  away, but the things that weren't swept away were the things that were anchored, the things  that were rooted, the things that were weighty, the monuments, the stone houses, but an  awful lot of other houses were swept away. Now, here is the second stage of temptation, the thing that waits something in your life,  so that it is not swept away, so it becomes central, so it sticks, so it has impact is  your imagination. It's your imagination. Sin is always an inflammation of the imagination.

Your imagination is that which gives glory to something, it's your imagination which looks  at the beauty of it and thinks about it, and it fondles it on the palette of your soul. The imagination is the tongue of your soul, the palette. He knew about the honor of God, he knew about the honor of his people, and he also knew  how wonderful these things were, but what he did was he set his imagination not on God and  not on his people, but he set his imagination on these things, these beautiful things. In other words, one of the ways some of you may be heard me say it, he knew about the  honor of God and the honor of his people, but he put that on audio, but he put these material  possessions on video. He let his senses be captivated by them.

He gave them glory, and whatever you give glory to you serve, whatever you ascribe the  most glory to, and this is a discipline of the mind, and he did it, and as a result,  the third step is, I coveted them, well okay, I gazed at them, I weighed them, of course  by now I coveted them, what is coveting? Is to worship something, coveting is to adore something, because whatever you glorify,  you will worship, you'll feel drawn to it. His heart was inflamed now, and there's really virtually no stopping it because in the  fourth step is, I took them. In other words, what craving does to you, we might think that I can't stop it, but you see  this is slow motion, this is great, this is what's great about this verse, it shows us  in slow motion, that what craving does, craving knows that there is a glory-fying apparatus  in the center of your being, and it takes it over, and therefore drives your life. Now how do we heal ourselves from it, that's the question then, okay, if that's how it  works, if that's how the craving works, in fact you can see there's even stages there,  how are we healed from it.

For some of you, this is very, very practical, some of you right now have a real problem  with self-control in certain areas, sometimes it's very, very physical, is it not a particular  sexual problem, a particular physical problem, a particular substance abuse. For others of us it's, you know, this desire, this desperate desire just to be loved,  and as a result our lives are being run by it, we want it so much that you see our lives  are being run by it, how do we get healed? I said in a sense there's three steps before you take it, I gazed, I wade, I coveted,  and I took, at any one of those three places you can break the chain, you can, you know,  you can get off the road, you can get, there's always, there's an exit ramp just before every  one of these toll booths, and here's the way, here's the way they work, and after the  service, if there's anybody who wants to go in a more detail on them, I have a question  answer time downstairs, but I'll just outline them now. The first one is number one, be aware of what you're gazing at, so just notice these things  don't gaze at them, and you know, people who, be aware what you're gazing at, nip it in  the bud, don't let your mind, don't be in a situation where these things can happen. Now that's maybe too easy, so I'll move right along, people in 12 step programs have  already gotten on to that, right?

They get together, and they hold each other accountable, don't go to those places, don't  think about those things, don't pay through those books, you know, cut up your credit  cards, whatever they do, depending on your craving, but you know, those of us who don't  have that kind of nice physical concupissance, we've also got to say, realize what you're  looking at during the day, realize where your gaze is, Archbishop William Temple said, use  the solitude test, he says, your religion is what you do with your solitude, whatever,  when you don't have to think of anything else, do you think about it? What is it that you comfort yourself with, where do your thoughts go to most effortlessly,  he says, that's your God, that's worship, proportion, craving? I have another test, I called the unanswered prayer test, what would you say to God about,  what would you say to God, Lord, if you do this to me, or if you refuse to give this to  me, we're through? And if you've got anything like that, and most of us do, whatever that is is more important  in God, and that is a worship sized thing, that is craving. So realize that you are gazing at things, notice them, but don't gaze at them, don't be  in a place where it can happen, okay, but then the second, the only, see, the first is  negative, stay away, stop it, turn your mind away, don't think about it, have accountability,  call your friend, call your buddy up, but the negative will not be enough.

In Hebrews chapter 12, it doesn't just say, let us run the race before us, casting off  every sin and every weight that entangles, it doesn't just stop there, it says, and  as fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfect of our faith. Thomas Chalmers in the early 19th century was a Scotsman, he was a pastor, and he was also  a Thaithman, and he lived in Edinburgh, and he was very upset with the poverty that he  saw in certain parts of the city, and he worked with these people, and he found many  of them had these life-dominating habits, and as a result of that work, he wrote a  fascinating chapter, which was originally a sermon, and he called it the expulsive power  of a new affection, and he said there, this, he said, the only way you can ever release  the soul from the power of a beautiful object is to give it a more beautiful object. He says, there's no way you can simply say, turn your mind away from the beautiful object  on which you're fixed. The only way to break the power of a beautiful object on your heart is to give it a more  beautiful object, and that's the reason why John Dunn put it this way. He spoke to the Lord, and he says, take me to you, imprison me, for I accept you and  you throw me, never shall be free, nor ever chased, except you ravish me.

What a risqué thing to say. I, he says, and throw me, take me to you, and prison me, because if you don't imprison  me, I'll be imprisoned by something else, and if you don't ravish me, I'll be ravished  by something else. What is it? The heart. Look it, look it, look it.

It's the beautiful thing that you've got to learn in the disciplines of worship and  the disciplines of your soul, in the disciplines of your heart, not just to believe in in some  general way, but to be ravished by. He is the beautiful thing. He is the new affection which has an expulsive power. Are you addicted to certainty? Well, the only certainty you really have is that Jesus loves you if you belong to him,  and it's the only one you need, and all other certainties won't have that power over  you.

Are you addicted to achievement? Well, the only verdict and honor you really have, if you're a Christian, is that Jesus  says, you are my beloved child in whom I'm well pleased, and it's the only one you need. If you think about it, and you know, most of the counselors will tell you, addictions  are ways for people to numb themselves and anesthetize themselves who don't think they  matter. You don't think you matter. Here's the ultimate cure for that.

Why would Jesus Christ die for you? Do you remember some years ago, an airplane crashed into the water in winter time at Washington,  D.C., and one man kept diving back into safe people, remember that? And he dove into safe people, and finally, last time he dove into safe one more person  and he didn't make it. And finally, they found his body, and I remember on the TV watching as they hoisted it up  and lifted it out of the water. And as he was lifted up, the people whose lives had been saved, just looked at him.

What did they think? One lady on camera said, why did he do that for me? Jesus Christ says, when I am lifted up, I will draw all men to myself. And John 12, and John says, he adds in parenthesis, thereby he showed what kind of death he  would die. When he was lifted up, why would he do that for you?

Why would he do that for you? The answer is, you matter. And don't you see the irony of the Christian gospel? The gospel is, you come to Jesus and you say, Lord Jesus, I give you all the glory. I can't possibly be good enough for the Father to accept me, but because you died for  me, because you live for me, I ascribe all glory to you, and I ask that God would save  me for your sake.

I receive you as my Savior. When you say that, and you give him all the glory, paradoxically, you get more glory  than you can bear, because you come to see that you matter enough that he died for you,  and that you matter to the only one in the universe whose opinion matters. And so Lewis himself says, to please God, to be a real ingredient in his joy, to be loved  by God, not just pitied, but delighted in as an artist delights in a work, or as a parent  in a child, as a weight of glory, our thoughts can hardly sustain, but so it is. Now, there's a third thing you have to do. If you actually get to the coveting stage and you actually take it, you repent.

And if your life is falling apart because it's gone too far, God says, I can make the  valley of Acorn, Acore, the door of hope. You may have already been stoned and burned, because you may have gone on to the place where  your craving has destroyed your life, you think, no, says God, no. I tell you, if you repent and come back, and learn to be ravaged with my son, and learn  to watch where you gaze, I tell you, I can rebuild you from the ground up. I can make the valley of Acore, a door of hope. Listen.

God calls us glutton to a real feast, the married supper of the lamb, and let me tell you  something, when you know there's an incredible dessert coming, you don't eat too much,  do you? You eat moderately. What do you say? You say, no, thank you. I don't want anymore.

That was really good. I don't want anymore. I'm saving some room for dessert, come and see what that is, let's pray. Our Father, we ask that you would make us moderate, that you would show us how important  it is to have this kind of stability, but the only way we can possibly break the power  of beautiful things on our hearts is to see a more beautiful thing. Your son is the fairest among 10,000, but especially as he dies on the cross and he's lifted  up and he draws us by his beauty, even though he's so broken.

It's a beautiful brokenness because it's for us. Let us be so ravished by the thoughts of those things, let us be so good at repentance,  let us be so good at watching how we look at things that we find ourselves no longer  in the grip of these cravings, but rather waiting for the marriage of the Lamb, eating moderately  and enjoying all good things here, for we ask it in Jesus' name. Amen.

### 中文翻译

今日。全以色列人用石头打死他，在他们用石头打死其他人之后，又用火焚烧他们。这是主说的话，论到以色列："我必追讨她烧香给诸巴力的日子。她佩戴戒指和珠宝，去随从她所爱的，却忘记我。"这是耶和华说的。

"因此，我现在必诱导她，领她进入旷野，对她说安慰的话。我必将她的葡萄园赐还她，使亚割谷成为盼望之门。她必在那里应声，像年幼的日子，像从埃及地上来的时候一样。"

这是神的话语。你知道，七宗罪由中世纪神学家托马斯·阿奎那特别编目整理。他编目的七宗罪之一就是贪食之罪（gluttony）。现在，从技术意义上讲，贪食（gluttony）这个词的技术含义是指过度饮食。当食物和饮料对你变得过于重要，你就会过度使用它们。

中世纪的道德神学家辨识出贪食的几种形式。他们说，你可以过量地吃喝，可以奢华地吃喝，可以挑剔地吃喝，或者冲动地吃喝。这些是不同种类的贪食。首先，过量意味着需求太多食物。你也可以奢华地吃，这意味着只需求最丰富的食物。

你可以挑剔地吃，这意味着只需求准备得最完美的食物。你还可以冲动地吃，这意味着现在就要食物，立刻就要。你知道，在纽约市很难避免贪食之罪。没有其他地方像这样，不仅每个街角都有食物。你身边有食物，当然，你可以闻到它，就在你的手肘旁，你到处走动时都能闻到。

当然，特别是挑剔这一类别，贪食的挑剔类别，非常难以避免，因为如果你在纽约住了一段时间，然后去国内其他地方拜访朋友，你知道，你会开始意识到，克利夫兰最好的餐厅也只不过相当于这里你家街角的熟食店。你会开始说，哦是的，还可以吧，你知道，你开始变得挑剔。现在我们笑。事实上，我们可能会非常傲慢地嘲笑整个贪食类别，但当我们思考两件事时，我们就笑不出来了。第一，中世纪的道德神学家在现代心理学之前就已经洞察了酗酒和饮食失调问题。

他们明白这里有问题，但让我再深入一点。你知道，每周你研究七宗罪之一，从某种意义上说，每种罪在表面行为上都是不同的。所以你可以像我们现在正在做的那样，通过一系列讲道或一系列章节来逐一探讨七宗罪，你会觉得其中一些比其他的更切中你，因为其中一些比其他的更是你的问题，这当然是有道理的。然而从另一个意义上说，如果你往深处看，如果你看到内在态度，七宗罪其实就像拿着一颗黑色钻石。当你转动这颗黑色钻石时，你知道，你会看到不同的切面，但每个切面只是向下看进同一个黑暗之心的另一种方式。

所以每一种罪都向我们展示了罪如何感染和影响我们所有人。这就是贪食对我们说的。贪食告诉我们关于我们所有人的一些事情。贪食就是拿一些好的、必要的东西，塞进去直到我们厌恶它，直到我们准备爆炸。贪食是一种方式，让我们看到罪已经影响了我们的心，以至于我们的欲望被扭曲了。我们的欲望被扭曲了，以至于美好和必要的东西变成了渴望，变成了痴迷。圣奥古斯丁给了它一个词。他说，我们都有这个特征。

罪对我们做了这样的事。我们都以他所称的"情欲"（concupiscence）为特征，但这是个好词。你知道，来自拉丁语 Cupera，意思是欲望，事实上，我们有丘比特（Cupid）这个词，爱神丘比特，与一种特定的欲望之神有关，但情欲（concupiscence）意味着有一种感染，有一种混乱。我们的欲望已被扭曲，以至于美好和必要的东西现在驱使着我们，我们渴望它们。换句话说。

贪食的反面是自制。由于我们所有人在某些方面都有自制力，由于我们所有人在某些方面都有自制力问题，我们都有一个地方，我们的欲望在那里被扭曲了。换句话说，罪使我们所有人都对某些东西上瘾。引人注目的成瘾，如酗酒，如何引人注目，它们是显而易见的，它们只是一个模板，用来理解我们所有人的心在某种程度上是如何运作的。这就是这教导我们的内容。

我们都在渴望的掌控之中。我们都渴望某些东西，而且我们这样做的方式，正如我将向你展示的，对我们来说是非常、非常糟糕的。现在，让我们看看这教导我们关于三种渴望的什么。你知道，我们的心在某个时刻充满了这样的要求和渴望。那是罪造成的。我们看到三件事，让我们学习这三件事。我们渴望的深度，我们渴望的结构，以及医治。我们学习我们渴望的深度，我们渴望的结构，以及我们渴望的医治。首先，让我们看看渴望的深度。当约书亚来到亚干面前时，经文说："我儿，将荣耀归给耶和华以色列的神，在他面前认罪。

告诉我你做了什么。不要向我隐瞒。"亚干说："这是真的。这里发生了一件非常值得注意的事情。我知道当我第一次读到它时，你看到亚干和他所有的牲畜以及他所有的家人被石头打死并被焚烧，有一种，这是曼哈顿，你知道，这是圣经中我们现在都知道发生的地方之一。

这是错误和可怕的。好吧，听着，亚干确切地知道他做了什么。你没有看到亚干说，哦天哪，你是说这是死罪？你是说你要这样做？你要做什么？

哦，不。他说，你抓到我了。听着，当神把以色列人从埃及带出来，带他们去迦南，去他们的应许之地时，当他们通过征服夺取那地时，他定下了一个规则。这个规则是这样的。他说，你们不只是任何嗜血的海盗国家。

其他国家是这样的。你们不能这样。你们来到迦南不是为了满足增加国家权力的欲望。其次，你们来到迦南不是为了满足你自己增加私人财富的欲望。哦，不。

你们不是海盗。你们不是来这里掠夺的。你们来到我应许给亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各的地。这地是你们的，我要在那里与你们同住。所以每当你们来到并夺取一座城市时，那城市所有的金钱、所有的财富，你们绝不能把它作为战利品。

你们绝不能把它看作掠夺物。这些都要用于建造会幕，后来建造圣殿，那将是所有人敬拜的殿，我将住在你们中间。因此，从来没有人这样征服过。从来没有这样的国家。从来没有这样征服的国家。

他说，你们不是出于帝国主义扩张的欲望而这样做。你们不是为了在物质上增强自己而这样做。哦，不。因此，他定下了这一条。你们绝不拿被征服之民的财物，绝不。

你看，这对他们作为一个民族的身份至关重要。这对整个征战的合法性至关重要，对神的荣耀绝对至关重要。这条规则已经定下，每个人都知道这是死罪。只要你不这样做，我就与你同在。只要他们不这样做，他就与他们同在，他们的征战就成功。每个人都知道那条规则。每个人都知道为什么它如此严重。每个人都知道它是神的荣耀的核心。神不只是说，哦，看，你们是我的子民。所以我只是想让你们去掠夺和屠杀其他所有人。

这对他们的自我理解绝对至关重要，对征战的道德性和合法性至关重要，对神的荣耀至关重要。所以当亚干看到他所看到的时候，我们马上就会看到。他的心如此贪恋那些东西，以至于他还是拿了。他知道他在做什么。他知道那有多糟糕。

他知道后果会有多严重，无论如何。当他被抓住时，他说，是的，是的，我做了。他没有说，什么？什么？你要做什么？

哦，不。他知道。这说明了什么？我告诉你这说明了什么。我们的渴望，我们内心对事物的欲望，如此强烈，以至于它克服了我们的良知，它克服了我们的理解，我们的理性，最终它会克服你对后果的恐惧，甚至克服你自己的自我保护意识。

罪如此影响你，以至于有些东西你必须拥有，你会渴望它们，你会如此渴望它们，以至于你会拿走它们，即使得到它们就意味着失去一切，就像亚干所做的那样。这就是渴望。内心让你如此想要某些东西。得到它们是自杀性的。得到它们总是意味着你最终失去一切，但你还是必须得到它。

这就是问题的严重性。罪以这样的方式影响我们的心，以至于我们内心最基本的部分不是我们的理性。不是我们的良知。甚至不是我们的自我保护本能。我们会得到我们想要的东西，无论这是否意味着我们最终失去一切。

你知道，在 C.S. 路易斯的第一部纳尼亚童话故事中，在那个故事里，女巫给爱德蒙一些土耳其软糖，它被施了魔法，这就是他对它的描述。任何曾经尝过这种土耳其软糖的人都会想要更多更多，甚至，如果被允许，会继续吃它直到把自己撑死。这就是人心抓住事物的方式的写照。我们都会这样抓住某些东西。记住，你们有些人上周肯定在这里，在民数记第11章，我们被告知以色列的孩子们一直在旷野中行走，神一直给他们吗哪吃，一种面包类的东西，但他们想要肉。

好吧，想要肉是可以的，但他们觉得——钦定版说他们"起了贪欲"要肉。神说，我会给你们肉，但因为你们渴望它，如果你回到我们上周看的那一章，往下看到第20和21节，有一个惊人的陈述，神说，我会给你们肉，你们要吃它，你们要吃它直到它从你们的鼻孔里出来，你们会厌恶它。我们内心这种渴望的本质，罪使我们渴望某些东西到这样的程度，我们想要它超出了对我们有益的程度。我们想要它超出了理性，超出了良知。无论如何我们都要这样做。

疑病症患者，让我给你一个简单的例子，我会给你展示其中一些。疑病症患者是那种如此想要健康，如此害怕失去健康的人，以至于他们失去了健康。他们不出门。他们害怕被感染。结果呢？保持健康的最好方法是什么？

阳光、新鲜空气，但在这些日子里，他如此害怕失去健康，以至于他失去了健康。当我上高中和大学时，我真的很想擅长吹小号。我相当擅长吹小号，但我如此迫切地想要擅长，以至于每当我去高中和大学的试音时，我最终部分因为这个原因放弃了音乐。每当我去试音时，我都会非常惊慌。我几乎无法把吹嘴保持在嘴唇上。

我会颤抖。有时我在试音时会哭，因为我是那么害怕。我如此害怕失去它，以至于我总是失去它。多年来，我不知道有多少次我辅导那些如此害怕失去配偶的配偶，以至于他们失去了配偶。他们太嫉妒，他们太依赖。

你可以继续说下去。孩子们呢？我的意思是，看，我是从非常严肃到崇高的，但你看，这就是渴望的运作方式。在学校里从来没有朋友的孩子是谁？记得他们是谁吗？

他们是那些如此渴望朋友的孩子。他们会像小狗一样追着你。如果你甚至对他们表现出一些兴趣，他们会说，哦，太好了，你想成为我的朋友。离我远点，你会想，你知道？是那些最想要朋友的人从来没有朋友。

他们太害怕了。他们如此想要朋友，以至于他们从来得不到。他们如此害怕失去，以至于总是失去。有些东西我们渴望，因为我们渴望它们，我们过度渴望它们。现在这伤害了我们。

在这里有点难谈论的一件事是指出，当你渴望或沉迷于非常具体的东西时，这更容易。例如，这里有人，这是纽约，所以我确信这里有人沉迷于美好的具体事物，比如有各种性成瘾，不正当关系或色情或类似的东西。有赌博，有酗酒，有饮食失调，在某些方面，你知道，疑病症，我提到过，在某些方面，那些至少更容易处理。你知道它们在那里，它们是具体的，它们是可见的，它们在许多情况下是物理的。但我们其他人呢？

你听着吗？大多数时候当你最沮丧时，大多数时候当你最灰心时，大多数时候当你最愤怒时，看看你自己。这是你会发现的。你如此沮丧的原因，你如此绝望的原因，你如此惊恐的原因，你如此被掌控的原因是因为在你的生活中有某种东西，而且通常它不是那么物理的，不是那么有形的。在你的生活中有某种东西，你过度地想要它。

如果你能对它有节制，如果你能说，她，我想要那个，她会是一件很棒的事情，但你知道，它并不那么关键。如果你能这样说，你就不会绝望，你可能会失望。你不会痛苦，你可能只是恼怒，你知道。你不会惊恐，你会担心。但因为它不是适度的，因为你必须拥有，因为在我们几乎所有的灰心底部，在我们几乎所有最深困难的底部，就是这个渴望。

我们放眼四周，看到破碎、战争、残酷和心痛。我们在周围的世界和我们自己的生活中都感受到它。它是如何变成这样的，能做些什么呢？在他本月即将发行的新书《世界出了什么问题》中，提姆·凯勒给出了一个清晰而富有同情心的答案。这本书源自他在救赎主教会的一系列教导，凯勒博士展示了罪的现实如何解释我们周围看到的痛苦，以及只有福音才能提供持久的自由和医治。无论你是被我们世界的状况所压倒，正在与自己的错误或选择作斗争，还是在寻找希望和喜乐，《世界出了什么问题》都将帮助你看到福音如何既对我们世界的心痛，也对我们每个人内心的痛苦说话。这本新发行的书《世界出了什么问题》是我们对你本月向福音与生命捐赠以帮助分享耶稣的好消息的感谢。今天在 gospelandlife.com/give 获取你的副本，那就是 gospelandlife.com/give。困难的是，当你真的沉迷于确定性时会发生什么？

这就是为什么你永远无法做出决定，这就是为什么你的生活停滞不前。因为你必须有确定性，除非你有确定性，否则你不会采取行动，因此你永远不会采取行动，因为你永远找不到它。你沉迷于它，或者成就，这就是为什么你们中的一些人工作到筋疲力尽，或者独立，这就是为什么你们中的许多人害怕承诺，或者你知道，我害怕依赖，这就是为什么你永远得不到它，因为你如此迫切地想要某个人，一旦你开始约会他们，他们就能感受到你内心的吸尘器。这些事情是，是的，我知道那个，你知道，我不是想搞笑，你知道，讲道继续进行，接近尾声，这是严肃的，而且很难看到。然而，亚干自杀了。

他知道那些东西是什么，他知道正在发生什么，他还是这样做了，他必须如此想要它，以至于他失去了一切。这是因为罪对内心做了这样的事。它拿走了好的东西，好的欲望，并扭曲它们，使之成为情欲。现在，摆脱它的原则是什么？首先你必须理解结构，你可以看看亚干是如何陷入其中的，然后其次你必须看到医治的基本原则。

我必须告诉你，基本上是一样的，尽管我不希望任何人认为在每种情况下，你的渴望没有必须解决的特定问题，以及我现在要提到的一般问题。我不认为我现在要提到的一般原则足以处理任何特定的渴望，因为每种渴望都有特定和一般两方面。但我要列出我们所有人都必须处理的东西，如果我们不想被因我们的渴望而来的试探所压倒。首先，看看结构，有四个步骤。亚干不是立即被这东西掌控的，有四个步骤。

你看他做了什么？他说，你知道，他说，我犯罪了，他说，我在掠夺物中看见一件美好的巴比伦衣服，二百舍客勒银子，一条金子重五十舍客勒。我贪爱这些物件，就拿去了。现在看，首先他说，我看见。这就是试探的运作方式。

看见这个词不是一个希伯来词，意思是注意到。这个词通常被翻译为"看哪"。你知道，每当在旧约中你有"看哪"这个词时，看哪某物意味着什么？它不仅仅意味着注意到某物。它意味着看，看，看。

看哪意味着持守它，把它放在你注意力的中心，思考它，凝视它。你注意到试探的第一步不是贪恋。事实上，我要向你展示那是第三步。试探的第一步是从注意到转向凝视。试探的第一步是当你向一个被禁止的东西敞开自己时，甚至还没有计划得到它，甚至还不想要它，但只是敞开自己停留在那里，在一个它可以发生的地方。

你无法避免注意到事物，因为所有好的东西，你知道，对你来说成为情欲的，都是好东西。你无法避免注意到它们，但凝视，那是第一步，只是敞开，只是能够看着一个对你被禁止的东西而不退缩，就是第一步。你已经进入了。然后第二步，我看见并说，我看哪，但接着第二步，我称量。现在，他说，哪里这么说？

好吧，那是转述，那是总结，但看他说了什么。他看到了什么？一件美好的巴比伦衣服，二百舍客勒银子，和一条金子。他怎么知道那袋子里有多少舍客勒？好吧，我注意到有二百舍客勒。

你怎么注意到有二百舍客勒？你知道，注意到五个是一回事。你可以注意到五个，但你不能注意到二百个。你必须凝视，你必须数数，你必须称量它。他怎么知道金子有多重？

现在，这是他在做什么，他所做的神学术语是他在给它们荣耀。在希伯来语中，荣耀这个词既有物理含义也有属灵含义。在希伯来语中，荣耀这个词字面上和物理上的意思是重量，但在属灵上它意味着重要性。这两样东西之所以有相同的，这个词可以在这两种方式中使用，与"matter"这个英语词一样。英语词 matter 可以意味着有重量的东西，但它也可以意味着重要的东西。

我记得我在宾夕法尼亚中部上大学，我大学毕业后的那个夏天，萨斯奎哈纳河在艾格尼丝飓风期间溢出堤岸，摧毁了各种小镇。我回到我上学的镇上，我注意到很多东西被冲走了，但没有被冲走的是那些被锚定的东西，那些有根的东西，那些有重量的东西，纪念碑，石头房子，但许多其他房子被冲走了。现在，这是试探的第二阶段，在你生活中给某物重量的东西，使它不被冲走，使它成为中心，使它停留，使它产生影响的，是你的想象力。是你的想象力。罪总是想象力的炎症。

你的想象力给某物荣耀，是你的想象力看着它的美丽并思考它，在你灵魂的味觉上爱抚它。想象力是你灵魂的舌头，味觉。他知道神的荣耀，他知道他子民的荣耀，他也知道这些东西有多美好，但他所做的是他把想象力不放在神身上，也不放在他的子民身上，而是放在这些东西上，这些美好的东西上。换句话说，你们有些人可能听过我说的一种方式，他知道神的荣耀和他子民的荣耀，但他把那个放在音频上，但他把这些物质财产放在视频上。他让他的感官被它们俘获。

他给它们荣耀，无论你给什么荣耀，你就服事什么，无论你把最多的荣耀归给什么，这是一种心灵的纪律，他做到了，因此，第三步是，我贪恋它们，好吧，好的，我凝视它们，我称量它们，当然到现在我贪恋它们，什么是贪恋？是敬拜某物，贪恋是崇拜某物，因为无论你荣耀什么，你都会敬拜，你会感到被它吸引。他的心现在被点燃了，实际上几乎无法阻止它，因为在第四步是，我拿走了它们。换句话说，渴望对你做什么，我们可能认为我无法阻止它，但你看这是慢动作，这很棒，这节经文很棒，它以慢动作向我们展示，渴望所做的，渴望知道在你存在的中心有一个荣耀化装置，它接管了它，因此驱动你的生活。现在我们如何从中医治自己，那么这就是问题，好的，如果这就是它的运作方式，如果这就是渴望的运作方式，事实上你可以看到那里甚至有阶段，我们如何从中得医治。

对你们中的一些人来说，这是非常、非常实际的，你们中的一些人现在在某些领域确实有自制力问题，有时它是非常、非常物理的，不是一个特定的性问题，一个特定的身体问题，一个特定的物质滥用。对我们其他人来说，你知道，这种欲望，这种只想被爱的绝望欲望，因此我们的生活被它控制，我们如此想要它，以至于你看我们的生活被它控制，我们如何得到医治？我说从某种意义上说，在你拿走它之前有三个步骤，我凝视，我称量,我贪恋，然后我拿走，在这三个地方中的任何一个，你都可以打破链条，你可以，你知道，你可以离开这条路，你可以，总是有，在每一个收费站之前都有一个出口匝道，这就是方式，这就是它们的运作方式，在礼拜结束后，如果有任何人想更详细地了解它们，我在楼下有一个问答时间，但我现在只概述它们。第一个是第一，注意你在凝视什么，所以只是注意这些东西，不要凝视它们，你知道，人们，注意你在凝视什么，把它扼杀在萌芽状态，不要让你的思想，不要处在这些事情可以发生的情境中。现在那可能太容易了，所以我马上继续，参加十二步计划的人已经明白了，对吧？

他们聚在一起，互相问责，不要去那些地方，不要想那些事情,不要翻阅那些书，你知道，剪掉你的信用卡，无论他们做什么，取决于你的渴望，但你知道，我们这些没有那种美好的物理情欲的人，我们也必须说，认识到你白天在看什么，认识到你的目光在哪里，坎特伯雷大主教威廉·坦普尔说，使用孤独测试，他说，你的宗教是你在孤独时所做的，无论什么，当你不必想其他任何事情时，你想什么？你用什么安慰自己，你的思想最容易去哪里，他说，那就是你的神，那就是敬拜，比例，渴望？我有另一个测试，我称之为未蒙应允的祷告测试，你会对神说什么，你会对神说什么，主啊，如果你对我做这个，或者如果你拒绝给我这个，我们就完了？如果你有任何类似的东西，而我们大多数人都有，无论那是什么，它都比神更重要，那是一个敬拜规模的东西，那就是渴望。所以认识到你在凝视事物，注意它们，但不要凝视它们，不要处在它可以发生的地方，好的，但接着第二个，唯一的，看，第一个是消极的，远离，停止，把你的思想转开，不要想它，有问责，打电话给你的朋友，打电话给你的伙伴，但消极的是不够的。

在希伯来书第12章，它不只是说，让我们奔那摆在我们前头的路程，脱去各样的罪和容易缠累我们的重担，它不只是停在那里，它说，并且仰望耶稣，我们信心的创始成终者。托马斯·查尔默斯在19世纪初是一位苏格兰人，他是一位牧师，也是一位神学家，他住在爱丁堡,他对他在城市某些地区看到的贫困非常不安，他与这些人一起工作，他发现他们中的许多人有这些主导生活的习惯，由于那项工作的结果，他写了一个引人入胜的章节，原本是一篇讲道，他称之为"新情感的驱逐力量"，他在那里说，这，他说，你能够从一个美好对象的力量中释放灵魂的唯一方法是给它一个更美好的对象。他说，没有办法你可以简单地说，把你的思想从你所专注的美好对象上转开。从美好对象对你内心的力量中解脱的唯一方法是给它一个更美好的对象，这就是为什么约翰·多恩这样说的原因。他对主说，带我到你那里，囚禁我，因为除非你俘虏我，我永远不会自由，除非你迷住我，我也永远不会纯洁。

多么大胆的话。他说，俘虏我，带我到你那里，囚禁我，因为如果你不囚禁我，我会被其他东西囚禁，如果你不迷住我，我会被其他东西迷住。这是什么？内心。看，看，看。

这是你必须在敬拜的纪律和你灵魂的纪律、你内心的纪律中学习的美好事物，不只是以某种一般的方式相信，而是要被迷住。他是那美好的事物。他是具有驱逐力量的新情感。你沉迷于确定性吗？好吧，如果你属于他，你真正拥有的唯一确定性是耶稣爱你，这是你唯一需要的，所有其他确定性都不会对你有那样的力量。

你沉迷于成就吗？好吧，如果你是基督徒，你真正拥有的唯一评判和荣誉是耶稣说，你是我的爱子，我喜悦你，这是你唯一需要的。如果你想想，你知道，大多数辅导员会告诉你，成瘾是人们麻痹自己和麻醉自己的方式，那些认为自己不重要的人。你不认为你重要。这是最终的治疗方法。

耶稣基督为什么要为你死？你还记得几年前，一架飞机在冬天坠入华盛顿特区的水中，一个人不断潜回去救人，记得吗？他潜水去救人，最后，最后一次他潜下去再救一个人，他没能回来。最后，他们找到了他的尸体，我记得在电视上看着他们把它拖起来从水中抬出。当他被举起时，那些生命被拯救的人，只是看着他。

他们想什么？一位女士在镜头前说，他为什么要为我这样做？耶稣基督说，我若从地上被举起来，就要吸引万人来归我。在约翰福音12章，约翰在括号中补充说，他这样说是指明自己将要怎样死。当他被举起时，他为什么要为你这样做？

他为什么要为你这样做？答案是，你很重要。你没看到基督教福音的讽刺吗？福音是，你来到耶稣面前说，主耶稣，我把所有荣耀都归给你。我不可能足够好到让父接纳我，但因为你为我死，因为你为我活，我把所有荣耀都归给你，我请求神因你的缘故拯救我。

我接受你为我的救主。当你这样说，把所有荣耀归给他时，矛盾的是，你得到的荣耀超过你所能承受的，因为你开始看到你很重要，足以让他为你死，而且你对宇宙中唯一意见重要的那一位来说很重要。所以路易斯本人说，取悦神，成为他喜乐中的真正成分，被神所爱，不只是被怜悯，而是被喜悦，就像艺术家喜悦于一件作品，或父母喜悦于孩子一样，是荣耀的重量，我们的思想几乎无法承受，但确实如此。现在，你必须做第三件事。如果你真的到了贪恋阶段并真的拿走了它，你悔改。

如果你的生活因为它走得太远而崩溃，神说，我可以使亚割谷成为盼望之门。你可能已经被石头打死并被焚烧，因为你可能已经到了你的渴望摧毁你生活的地步，你想，不，神说，不。我告诉你，如果你悔改并回来，学会被我的儿子迷住，学会注意你在凝视什么，我告诉你，我可以从根基上重建你。我可以使亚割谷成为盼望之门。听着。

神呼召我们这些贪食者去真正的筵席，羔羊的婚筵，让我告诉你一些事，当你知道有一道令人难以置信的甜点要来时，你不会吃太多，对吗？你吃得适度。你说什么？你说，不，谢谢。我不想要更多了。

那真的很好。我不想要更多了。我要留些空间吃甜点，来看看那是什么，让我们祷告。我们的父，我们祈求你使我们有节制，你向我们展示拥有这种稳定性是多么重要，但我们能够打破美好事物对我们内心的力量的唯一方法是看到一个更美好的事物。你的儿子是万人中最美的，但特别是当他死在十字架上，他被举起，他以他的美吸引我们，尽管他如此破碎。

这是一种美好的破碎，因为那是为了我们。让我们如此被这些事情的思想所迷住，让我们如此擅长悔改，让我们如此善于注意我们如何看待事物，以至于我们发现自己不再被这些渴望所掌控，而是等待羔羊的婚筵，适度地吃，享受这里所有的好东西，我们奉耶稣的名祈求。阿们。

---

今天。全以色列人用石头打死他，在他们用石头打死其余的人之后，他们焚烧了他们。这是主在说话，谈论以色列。我要因她向巴力烧香的日子惩罚她。她用环子和珠宝打扮自己，去追随她的情人。

但她却忘记了主。因此，我现在要引诱她。我要领她到旷野，对她说温柔的话。因此我要将她的葡萄园还给她，我要使亚割谷成为希望之门。在那里她要歌唱，如同在她年轻的日子，如同她从埃及上来的日子。

这是神的话语。你知道，七宗罪是由中世纪神学家托马斯·阿奎那特别编录的。他编录的七宗罪之一就是暴食之罪。现在暴食在技术意义上，暴食这个词的技术含义是过度地吃喝。当食物和饮料对你变得太重要，而你不节制地使用它时。

中世纪的道德神学家辨识出几种暴食的形式。他们说你可以过度地吃喝，你可以奢侈地、讲究地或冲动地吃喝。这些是不同种类的暴食。所以首先，你有过度，这意味着要求太多食物。你也可以奢侈地吃，这是只要求最丰盛的食物。

你可以讲究地吃，这意味着只要求准备得最完美的食物。你可以冲动地吃，这是要求现在就要食物，马上就要。你知道，在纽约市很难避免暴食之罪。没有其他地方你不仅在每个角落都有食物。你在你的身边就有食物，当然，你能闻到它的味道，就在你的肘边，你移动到的每个地方。

当然，特别是讲究的类别，讲究类别的暴食，非常难，因为如果你在纽约住了一段时间，然后去国内其他地方拜访朋友，你知道，你开始意识到克利夫兰最好的餐厅也只不过和你这里拐角的熟食店一样好。你开始说，哦是的，还可以，你知道，你开始变得

美食。现在我们会笑。事实上，我们可能会非常居高临下地嘲笑整个贪食这一类别，但当我们思考两件事时，我们就笑不出来了。第一，中世纪的道德神学家们在现代心理学之前很早就发现了酗酒和饮食失调的问题。

他们明白这里有些不对劲，但让我再深入一点。你知道，每周你都会学习七宗罪中的一个，从某种意义上说，每一种罪在表面行为上都是不同的。所以你可以像我们现在这样通过一系列讲道或一系列章节来学习七宗罪，你会感到其中一些比其他的更击中你，因为其中一些比其他的更是你的问题，这当然是有道理的。然而从另一个意义上说，如果你深入探究，如果你审视内心深处的态度，七宗罪就像是拿着一颗黑钻石。当你转动这颗黑钻石时，你知道，你看到的是不同的切面，但每一个切面都只是另一种方式来审视同样的黑暗之心。

所以每一种罪都向我们展示了罪是如何感染和影响我们所有人的。这就是贪食告诉我们的。贪食告诉我们关于我们所有人的一些事情。贪食就是把一些好的、必需的东西塞进去，直到我们厌烦它，直到我们快要爆炸。贪食是一种让我们看到罪已经影响了我们的心，以至于我们的欲望是混乱的方式。我们的欲望以这样一种方式被扭曲，以至于好的和必需的东西变成了渴望，变成了强烈的渴求。圣奥古斯丁给它起了一个词。他说，我们都有这个特征。

罪对我们做了这件事。我们都有他所说的"concupacence"这个特征，这是个很好的词。你知道，来自拉丁语Cupera，意思是欲望，事实上，我们有cupid这个词，丘比特之神，与某种特定类型的欲望之神有关，但concupacence意味着有一种感染，有一种混乱。我们的欲望已经被扭曲到这样一种程度，以至于好的和必需的东西现在驱使着我们，我们渴望它们。换句话说。

贪食的反面是自制。既然我们所有人

在某个地方缺乏自我控制，因为我们所有人都在某个地方有自我控制的问题，我们都有一个欲望失序的地方。换句话说，罪使我们所有人都对某些东西上瘾。那些显而易见的瘾，比如酗酒，比如家庭暴力，这些都是明显的，它们只是一个模板，帮助我们理解我们所有人的心在某种程度上是如何运作的。这就是这段经文教导我们的。

我们都被渴望所控制。我们都渴望某些东西，而且我们这样做的方式，正如我将要向你展示的，对我们是非常、非常有害的。现在，让我们来看看这段经文教导我们关于三种渴望的内容。你知道，在某个时刻，我们的心充满了这种强烈的要求和渴望。这就是罪所造成的。

我们看到的三件事，让我们学习这三件事。我们渴望的深度，我们渴望的结构，以及医治。我们学习我们渴望的深度，我们渴望的结构，以及我们渴望的医治。首先，让我们看看渴望的深度。当约书亚来到亚干面前时，经文说，我儿，将荣耀归给耶和华以色列的神，并赞美他。

告诉我你做了什么。不要向我隐瞒。亚干说，这是真的。这里有一件了不起的事情正在发生。我知道当我第一次读到它时，你看到亚干和他所有的牲畜以及他所有的家人被石头打死并被焚烧，有一种感觉，这是曼哈顿，你知道，这是圣经中那些我们现在都知道的事情发生的地方之一。

这是错误和可怕的。好吧，听着，亚干完全知道他做了什么。你不会看到亚干说，哦我的天哪，你是说这是死罪？你是说你要这样做？你要做什么？

哦，不。他说，你抓到我了。听着，当神把以色列人从埃及带出来，把他们迁移到迦南，他们的应许之地时，当他们通过征服夺取那片土地时，他定下了一条规则。那条规则是这样的。他说，你们不是任何一个嗜血的海盗国家。

其他国家是这样的。你们不会是这样的。你们进入迦南不是为了满足增强国家权力的欲望。其次，你们

不是来到迦南地满足你自己增加私人财富的个人欲望。哦，不是的。

你们不是海盗。你们不是来这里掠夺的。你们要来到我应许给亚伯拉罕、以撒和雅各的土地。那是你们的，我要在那里与你们同住。所以每当你们来攻取一座城的时候，那城所有的金钱、所有的财富，你们绝不能将它作为战利品。

你们绝不能将它视为掠夺之物。那些要用来建造会幕，后来建造圣殿，那将是所有百姓敬拜的殿，我也要住在你们中间。因此从来没有人这样征战过。从来没有一个国家像这样。从来没有一个民族像这样征战。

他说，你们不是出于帝国主义扩张的欲望而做这事。你们不是出于单纯想在物质上增加自己而做这事。哦，不是的。因此，他定下了这个规矩。你们绝不能拿被征服民族的财物，绝不能。

你们看，这对于他们作为一个民族的身份认同是至关重要的。这对于整个战役的合法性是至关重要的，这对于神的荣耀绝对是至关重要的。这条规矩被定下来，每个人都知道这是死罪。只要你们不这样做，我就与你们同在。只要他们不这样做，神就与他们同在，他们在战役中就得胜。

每个人都知道那条规矩。每个人都知道为什么它如此严重。每个人都知道它是神的荣耀的核心。神并没有只是说，哦，看，你们是我的子民。所以我只是想让你们去掠夺和屠杀其他所有人。

这对于他们的自我认知绝对是至关重要的，对于战役的道德性和合法性至关重要，对于神的荣耀至关重要。所以当亚干看到他所看到的东西时，我们马上会看到。他的心如此贪恋那些东西，以至于他无论如何都要拿走。他知道自己在做什么。他知道这有多坏。

他知道无论如何后果会有多严重。当他被抓住的时候，他说，是的，是的，我做了。他没有说，什么？什么？你要怎样？

哦不。他知道。那么重点是什么呢？我告诉你重点是

重点在于，我们的渴望，我们内心对事物的欲望是如此强烈，以至于它压倒了我们的良心，压倒了我们的理解力和理性，最终它会压倒你对后果的恐惧，甚至压倒你自我保护的本能。

罪对你的影响是如此之深，以至于有些东西你必须拥有，你会渴望它们，你会如此渴望它们，以至于你会去夺取它们，即使得到它们就意味着失去一切，就像亚干所做的那样。这就是渴望。内心让你如此想要某些东西，以至于得到它们是自杀性的。得到它们总是意味着你会失去一切，但你还是必须得到它。

事情就是这么糟糕。罪以这样的方式影响我们的内心，以至于我们内心最基本的部分不是我们的理性，不是我们的良心，甚至不是我们自我保护的本能。我们会得到我们想要的东西，无论这是否意味着我们最终会失去一切。

你知道，在C.S.刘易斯的《纳尼亚传奇》第一个童话故事中，女巫给了爱德蒙一些土耳其软糖，这糖是被施了魔法的，他是这样描述它的：任何人只要尝过一次这种土耳其软糖，就会想要越来越多，甚至，如果允许的话，会一直吃下去直到把自己撑死。这就是人心执着于事物的方式的写照。我们都会执着于某些类似的东西。记得，我相信你们中的一些人上周在这里，在民数记第11章，我们被告知以色列的子民一直在旷野中行走，神一直赐给他们吗哪吃，一种面包类的食物，但他们想要肉。

嗯，想要肉是可以的，但钦定版圣经说他们陷入了对肉的贪欲。神说，我会给你们肉，但因为你们渴望它，如果你回到我们上周看的那一章，读到第20和21节，那里有一个令人惊讶的陈述，神说，我会给你们肉，你们会吃它，你们会一直吃它，直到它从你们的鼻孔里出来，你们开始厌恶它。我们内心这种渴望的本质是，罪使我们对某些事物的欲望达到了一种程度，我们想要它超过了对我们有益的程度。我们想要它

超越理性，超越良知。我们无论如何都会这样做。

让我给你一个简单的例子，疑病症患者，我会向你展示其中一些。疑病症患者是那种太想要健康、太害怕失去健康，结果反而失去了健康的人。他们不出门。他们害怕被感染，结果呢？保持健康的最好方法是什么？

阳光、新鲜空气，但在这些日子里，他因为太害怕失去健康，反而失去了健康。当我上高中和大学时，我真的很想擅长吹小号。我吹小号还算不错，但我太想要做得好了，以至于每次在高中和大学参加试音时，我最终部分因为这个原因放弃了音乐。每次我去试音时，我都会完全吓呆。我几乎无法把吹嘴稳定地放在嘴唇上。

我会颤抖。有时我在试音时甚至会哭，因为我太害怕了。我太害怕失败，结果总是失败。这些年来，我不知道有多少次辅导那些太害怕失去配偶、结果真的失去了配偶的人。他们太嫉妒，太依赖。

你可以继续举例。那些孩子呢？我的意思是，你看，我从非常严肃的话题说到了平常的事，但你看，这就是渴望的运作方式。学校里那些从来没有朋友的孩子是谁？还记得他们吗？

他们就是那些太想要朋友的孩子。他们会像小狗一样追着你。如果你对他们表现出一点兴趣，他们就会说，哦，太好了，你想成为我的朋友。离我远点，你会想，你知道吗？最想要朋友的人往往没有朋友。

他们太害怕了。他们太想要朋友了，结果从来得不到。他们太害怕失去，结果总是在失去。有些东西我们渴望，正因为我们渴望它们，我们对它们的渴望就失去了比例。这现在就在伤害我们。

这里有点难谈的一点是，当你渴望或沉迷于非常具体的东西时，会更容易看出来。比如这里有些人，这是纽约，所以我确信这里有人沉迷于美好的

具体的事情，比如有各种各样的性成瘾、不正当关系或色情内容之类的。有赌博、有酗酒、有饮食失调，而且在某些方面，你知道，疑病症，我提到过，在某些方面，这些问题至少更容易处理一些。你知道它们在那里，它们是具体的，它们是可见的，在很多情况下它们是身体性的。但我们其他人呢？

你愿意听吗？大多数时候，当你最沮丧的时候，大多数时候，当你最气馁的时候，大多数时候，当你处于暴怒之中的时候，看看你自己。这就是你会发现的。你如此气馁的原因，你如此绝望的原因，你如此恐惧的原因，你如此被控制的原因，是因为在你的生活中有某样东西，而且很多时候它并不那么具体，并不那么有形。在你的生活中有某样东西，是你过度渴望的。

如果你能对它保持适度，如果你能说，嘿，我想要那个，那会是件很棒的事，但你知道，它并没有那么重要。如果你能这样说，你就不会陷入绝望，你可能会失望。你不会陷入苦毒，你可能只是有点恼火，你知道的。你不会吓呆了，你会担心。但正是因为它不是适度的，因为你必须拥有，因为这种渴望就在我们几乎所有的沮丧的底层，在我们几乎所有最深层的困难的底层。

我们放眼望去，看到的是破碎、战争、残酷和心痛。我们在周围的世界和我们自己的生活中都能感受到。怎么会变成这样，又能做些什么呢？在他本月即将出版的全新著作《世界出了什么问题》中，提姆·凯勒给出了一个清晰而富有同情心的答案。凯勒博士借鉴了在救赎主教会所做的一系列教导，展示了罪的现实如何解释我们周围看到的痛苦，以及为什么只有福音才能提供持久的自由和医治。

无论你是被我们世界的状况所压倒，还是在与自己的错误或选择作斗争，或是在寻找希望和喜乐，《世界出了什么问题》都将帮助你

你看，福音如何回应我们世界的心痛和我们每个人内心的痛苦。这本新发布的书《世界出了什么问题》是我们对你本月捐赠的感谢，帮助福音与生命分享耶稣的好消息。这是你今天在gospelandlife.com slash give的副本，就是gospelandlife.com slash give。而且你看，困难的是，当你真正沉迷于确定性时会发生什么？

这就是为什么你永远无法做出决定的原因，这就是为什么你的生活陷入困境的原因。因为你必须要有确定性，除非你拥有它，否则你不会采取行动，因此你永远不会采取行动，因为你永远找不到它。你沉迷于它，或者沉迷于成就，这就是为什么你们中的一些人把自己工作到遗忘，或者沉迷于独立，这就是为什么你们中的许多人害怕承诺的原因，或者你知道，我害怕依赖，这就是为什么你永远得不到它的原因，因为你如此拼命地想要一些，当你开始和他们约会的那一刻，他们就能感受到你心中的真空吸尘器。这些事情是，是的，我知道，你知道，我不是故意要搞笑的，你知道，布道继续进行，快到结尾了，这很严肃，而且很难看清。然而，亚干自杀了。

他知道那些东西是什么，他知道正在发生什么，他还是那样做了，他太需要它了，以至于失去了一切。这就是罪对心灵的作用。它把好的，好的欲望，扭曲成贪婪的罪。现在，摆脱困境的原则是什么？首先你必须理解这个结构，你可以看看亚干是如何陷入其中的，其次你必须看到治愈的基本原则。

我必须告诉你，基本上是一样的，尽管我不希望任何人认为在每种情况下，你的渴望都没有需要解决的特殊问题，以及我现在要提到的一般问题。我不认为我将要提到的一般原则足以解决任何特定的渴望，因为每一种渴望都有其特殊和一般的方面。但是

如果我们不想被因贪欲而来的试探所压倒，我要列出我们都必须面对的事情。首先，看看这个结构，有四个步骤。亚干不是立刻就被这事抓住的，有四个步骤。

你看他做了什么？他说，你知道，他说，我犯了罪，他说，我在掳物中看见一件美好的示拿衣服，二百舍客勒银子，和一条金子重五十舍客勒。我贪爱这些物件，就拿去了。现在看，首先他说，我看见了。试探就是这样运作的。

"看见"这个词不是希伯来语中表示"注意到"的词。这是通常翻译为"注视"的词。你知道，每当在旧约中出现"注视"这个词时，注视某物是什么意思？它不仅仅意味着注意到某物。它意味着看，看，看。

"注视"意味着把持它，把它放在你注意力的中心，思考它，凝视它。你会注意到试探的第一步不是贪爱。事实上，我要告诉你那是第三步。试探的第一步是从注意到转向凝视。试探的第一步是当你向一个禁忌的事物敞开自己，甚至还没有计划要得到它，甚至还不想要它，只是敞开自己待在那里，待在一个可能发生的地方。

你无法避免注意到事物，因为所有好的东西，你知道，那些对你变成贪欲的，都是好东西。你无法避免注意到它们，但凝视，那是第一步，只是敞开，只是能够看着一个对你而言被禁止的事物而不退缩，就是第一步。你已经进入了。然后第二步，我看见了并说，我注视了，但接着第二步，我称量了。现在，他说，哪里说了这个？

嗯，那是一个转述，那是一个总结，但看他说了什么。他看见了什么？一件美好的示拿衣服，二百舍客勒银子，和一条金子。他怎么知道那袋子里有多少舍客勒？嗯，我注意到有二百舍客勒。

你怎么注意到有二百舍客勒？你知道，注意到五个是一回事。你可以注意到五个，但你不能注意到二百个。你必须

一个凝视，一个计数，还得称重。他怎么知道金子有多重？

现在，他所做的事情，从神学术语来说就是他在给这些东西荣耀。在希伯来语中，荣耀这个词既有物质上的含义，也有属灵上的含义。在希伯来语中，荣耀这个词从字面和物质上意味着重量，但在属灵上它意味着重要性。这两个意思可以用同一个词来表达的原因，就像英语中的"matter"这个词一样。英语中的"matter"既可以指有分量的东西，也可以指重要的事情。

我记得我在宾夕法尼亚州中部上大学，大学毕业后的那个夏天，萨斯奎汉纳河在艾格尼丝飓风期间决堤，摧毁了许多小镇。我回到我上学的小镇，注意到很多东西都被冲走了，但没有被冲走的是那些有根基的、有根基的、有分量的东西——纪念碑、石头房子，但很多其他房子都被冲走了。

现在，这是试探的第二阶段，在你生命中给某样东西分量，使它不被冲走，使它成为核心，使它固定下来，使它产生影响的，是你的想象力。是你的想象力。罪总是想象力的膨胀。

你的想象力就是赋予某物荣耀的东西，正是你的想象力看着它的美丽并思考它，在你灵魂的味觉上抚摸它。想象力是你灵魂的舌头，是味觉。他知道神的荣耀，他知道他百姓的荣耀，他也知道这些东西有多么美好，但他所做的是把他的想象力不是放在神身上，也不是放在他的百姓身上，而是放在这些东西上，这些美丽的东西上。换句话说，你们有些人可能听过我这样说，他知道神的荣耀和他百姓的荣耀，但他把这些放在音频上，却把这些物质财富放在视频上。他让自己的感官被它们俘获。

他给了它们荣耀，并且

无论你把荣耀归给什么，你就服事什么，无论你把最大的荣耀归给什么，这是一种心思的操练，他做到了，结果，第三步是，我贪恋它们，好的，我凝视它们，我权衡它们，当然到现在我贪恋它们了，什么是贪恋？就是敬拜某样东西，贪恋就是崇拜某样东西，因为无论你荣耀什么，你就会敬拜它，你会感到被它吸引。他的心现在被点燃了，实际上几乎无法阻止它，因为第四步是，我拿了它们。换句话说，渴望对你做了什么，我们可能认为我无法阻止它，但你看这是慢动作，这很棒，这就是这节经文伟大之处，它以慢动作向我们展示，渴望所做的事情，渴望知道在你存在的中心有一个荣耀化装置，它接管了它，因此驱动你的生活。那么我们如何从中医治自己，那就是问题所在，好的，如果这就是它的工作方式，如果这就是渴望的工作方式，事实上你可以看到那里甚至有阶段，我们如何从中得医治。

对你们中的一些人来说，这非常非常实际，你们中的一些人现在在某些领域确实存在自制力问题，有时它是非常非常生理性的，是不是一个特定的性问题，一个特定的身体问题，一个特定的药物滥用。对我们其他人来说，你知道，这种渴望，这种被爱的迫切渴望，结果我们的生活被它驱使，我们如此渴望它，以至于你看我们的生活被它驱使，我们如何得医治？我说在某种意义上，在你拿走它之前有三个步骤，我凝视，我权衡，我贪恋，然后我拿走，在这三个地方中的任何一个你都可以打破这个链条，你可以，你知道，你可以离开这条路，你可以，总是有，在每一个收费站之前总有一个出口匝道，这就是方法，这就是它们的工作方式，在聚会之后，如果有人想更详细地了解它们，我在楼下有一个问答时间，但我现在只概述它们。第一个是第一条，意识到你在凝视什么，所以只是注意这些东西，不要凝视它们，你

你知道,那些人,要意识到你在注视什么,把它扼杀在萌芽状态,不要让你的思想,不要处在一个这些事情可能发生的环境中。现在这可能太简单了,所以我马上继续讲,参加12步戒瘾计划的人已经明白了这一点,对吧?

他们聚在一起,互相监督问责,不要去那些地方,不要想那些事情,不要翻阅那些书,你知道的,剪掉你的信用卡,无论他们做什么,取决于你的渴望,但你知道,我们这些没有那种明显的肉体欲望的人,也必须说,意识到你白天在看什么,意识到你的目光在哪里,大主教威廉·坦普尔说,使用独处测试,他说,你的宗教就是你在独处时做什么,无论什么,当你不必想任何其他事情时,你会想什么?什么是你用来安慰自己的,你的思想最不费力地飘向哪里,他说,那就是你的神,那就是崇拜,比例,渴望?我还有另一个测试,我称之为未应允祷告测试,你会对神说什么,你会对神说什么,主啊,如果你这样对我,或者如果你拒绝给我这个,我们就完了?如果你有任何这样的东西,而我们大多数人都有,无论那是什么,它都比神更重要,那是一个崇拜级别的东西,那就是渴望。所以要意识到你在注视事物,注意它们,但不要凝视它们,不要在一个可能发生的地方,好的,但接下来第二点,唯一的,你看,第一点是消极的,远离,停止,把你的思想转移开,不要想它,要有问责,打电话给你的朋友,打电话给你的伙伴,但仅仅消极是不够的。

在希伯来书第12章,它不只是说,让我们奔跑摆在我们前面的路程,脱去一切缠累我们的罪和重担,它不只是停在那里,它说,并且仰望耶稣,我们信心的创始成终者。托马斯·查默斯在19世纪初是一位苏格兰人,他是一位牧师,也是一位神学家,他住在爱丁堡,他对他在城市某些地区看到的贫困感到非常不安,他与

这些人，他发现他们中的许多人都有这些主导生活的习惯，作为那项工作的结果，他写了一个引人入胜的章节，最初是一篇讲道，他称之为"新情感的驱逐力量"，他在那里说，他说，你能够将灵魂从一个美丽事物的力量中释放出来的唯一方法，就是给它一个更美丽的事物。他说，你不可能简单地说，把你的心思从你所专注的美丽事物上移开。打破美丽事物对你心灵的力量的唯一方法是给它一个更美丽的事物，这就是为什么约翰·邓恩这样说的原因。他对主说话，他说，把我带到你那里，囚禁我，因为我接受你，你掳掠我，我将永不自由，也永不纯洁，除非你迷住我。

多么大胆的话语。我，他说，掳掠我，把我带到你那里，囚禁我，因为如果你不囚禁我，我将被别的东西囚禁，如果你不迷住我，我将被别的东西迷住。那是什么？就是心。看，看，看。

这是你必须在敬拜的操练和灵魂的操练中，在心灵的操练中学习的美丽事物，不仅仅是在某种笼统的方式上相信，而是要被其迷住。祂是那美丽的事物。祂是具有驱逐力量的新情感。你对确定性上瘾吗？好吧，如果你属于祂，你真正拥有的唯一确定性就是耶稣爱你，这是你唯一需要的，所有其他的确定性不会对你有那种力量。

你对成就上瘾吗？好吧，如果你是基督徒，你真正拥有的唯一判决和荣誉就是耶稣说，你是我所喜悦的爱子，这是你唯一需要的。如果你想想，你知道，大多数辅导员会告诉你，成瘾是人们麻痹自己和麻醉自己的方式，因为他们认为自己无关紧要。你认为自己无关紧要。这是对此的终极治疗。

为什么耶稣基督会为你而死？你还记得几年前，一架飞机在冬天坠入华盛顿特区的水中吗，

有一个人不断地潜回去救人，还记得吗？他一次次潜入水中救人，最后，当他最后一次潜入再救一个人时，他没能出来。最终，他们找到了他的遗体，我记得在电视上看着他们把遗体吊起来，从水中抬出。当他被抬起时，那些被他救活的人们只是看着他。

他们在想什么？一位女士对着镜头说："他为什么要为我这样做？"耶稣基督说："当我被举起来的时候，我要吸引万人归向我。"在约翰福音12章，约翰在括号中补充说："他借此表明他将要怎样死。"当他被举起时，他为什么要为你这样做？

他为什么要为你这样做？答案是：你很重要。你难道看不出基督教福音的讽刺意味吗？福音是：你来到耶稣面前说："主耶稣，我把一切荣耀都归给你。我不可能好到让天父接纳我，但因为你为我而死，因为你为我而活，我把一切荣耀都归给你，我祈求神因你的缘故拯救我。"

我接受你作为我的救主。当你说出这话，把一切荣耀归给他时，矛盾的是，你得到了你难以承受的荣耀，因为你开始明白，你重要到他为你而死，而且你对宇宙中唯一重要的那一位来说很重要。所以路易斯自己说："取悦神，成为他喜乐中真正的成分，被神所爱——不仅仅是被怜悯，而是被喜悦，就像艺术家喜悦于作品，或父母喜悦于孩子一样——这是我们的思想几乎无法承受的荣耀之重，但事实就是如此。"现在，你必须做第三件事。如果你真的到了贪恋的阶段并真的拿了，你要悔改。

如果你的生活因为走得太远而分崩离析，神说："我能使亚割谷成为指望的门。"你可能已经被石头打死、被焚烧了，因为你可能已经走到了你的贪欲摧毁你生活的地步，你想："不行。"神说："不。我告诉你，如果你悔改回转，学会对我儿子充满渴慕，学会留意你的目光所向，我告诉你，我能从根基上重建你。我能

使亚割谷成为指望的门户。听着。

神呼召我们这些贪食者来赴真正的筵席，羔羊的婚宴，让我告诉你，当你知道有美味的甜点即将到来时，你就不会吃太多，对吧？你会适度地吃。你会说什么？你会说，不，谢谢。我不想再吃了。

那真的很好吃。我不想再吃了。我要留点空间给甜点，来看看那是什么，让我们祷告。我们的父，我们祈求你使我们节制，求你向我们显明拥有这种稳定性是多么重要，但我们唯一可能打破美好事物对我们内心掌控的方法，就是看见一个更美的事物。你的儿子是万人中的佳偶，尤其是当他死在十字架上，他被举起来，以他的美吸引我们，尽管他如此破碎。

这是美丽的破碎，因为那是为了我们。愿我们被这些事的思想所深深吸引，愿我们善于悔改，愿我们善于留意自己如何看待事物，使我们发现自己不再被这些渴望所辖制，而是等候羔羊的婚宴，适度地吃，享受这里的一切美好事物，我们奉耶稣的名祈求。阿们。
