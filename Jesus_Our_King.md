## English Transcript / 英文原文

today's teaching, Tim Keller impacts how Jesus actively seeks us, reveals truth to  us, and calls us to Himself. I'm going to read you from Psalm 2, our teaching, this afternoon it's taken from Psalm 2. It's all printed in your bulletin. It's a shorter Psalm than we have been, seems like looking at recently, we've been looking  at very long Psalms, this is only 12 verses, and I'll read it first. Why do the nations conspire and the people's plot in vain?

The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against the Lord  and against his anointed one. Let us break their chains, they say, and throw off their fetters. The one enthroned in heaven laughs. The Lord scoffs at them. Then He rebukes them in His anger and terrifies them in His wrath, saying, I have installed  my king on Zion, my holy hill.

I will proclaim the decree of the Lord. He said to me, you are my son, today I have become your father, ask of me, and I will  make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession. You will rule them with an iron scepter, you will dash them to pieces like pottery. Therefore, you kings, be wise, be warned you rulers of the earth, serve the Lord with fear  and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the sun, less TB angry, and you will be destroyed in your way.

For His wrath can flare up in a moment, blessed are all who take refuge in Him. This is God's word. It's an advent, as we approach Christmas, we ask ourselves, what did Jesus Christ come  to do? And we've been answering this question last week, this week, next week, by looking at some  of the Psalms, we've been looking at the Psalms all fall. And I think I mentioned last week that some Psalms have been understood by the Christian  Church as Messianic Psalms, they're called Messianic Psalms, because Jesus Himself picked  out a few, some Psalms, and He said, you know this Psalm, like we said last week, John  chapter 15, He quotes from Psalm 69, and He says, you know, this Psalm talks about David,  he talks about the Psalmist, and the immediate environment of the Psalmist, but it's also  foreshadowing and talking about me.

And these particular Psalms, therefore, can be read on two levels. They have, in a sense, two horizons, two reference. They've got the reference to the immediate historical context of the person writing the  Psalm, but they've also got an ultimate reference to a greater David than David, a greater  king than this king, a greater warrior, a greater suffering servant, and so on. Now this particular Psalm is a coronation Psalm. If you read it carefully, you'll see that it actually consists of several stanzas, and  it has to do with the a session of someone to the throne of Israel.

And it can be read, obviously, just on that level. You see, someone in David's line, this could either be David, it might have been originally  written when David was crowned, but it certainly was also used in other situations when descendants  of David were installed as king. And in the beginning, it talks about the nations of the earth plotting against the king. Well, it's natural that if you became a king in those days, you had a whole lot of hostile  neighbors who couldn't wait to test out just what kind of king you really were, what kind  of general you really were, which was the same thing. And therefore, the context of the Psalm is God is seen as installing the king in Israel  on Zion, which was one of the hills.

Zion was the original hill in Jerusalem on which the original Jebiusite city, the Jebiusite's  built a city in Jerusalem before the Israelites built a city. And so Zion was just simply another way of talking about the entire city of Jerusalem. So here in Jerusalem, the king has been installed, but all the foreign hostile kings are conspiring  against this king. So the Psalmist says, be warned. God is with him.

God is going to take care of him. He will give, God will give us aid. And that's how you can read the Psalm at one level. But if you read it carefully, you will see that no earthly king can completely justify  the fury of the threats. And no earthly king can completely justify the glory of the promises, the language you  might say of Psalm 2 spills out over its banks.

If Psalm 2 is a river, the language comes up over top of it. The things that are said about this king, this anointed one, are far too great to really  be confined to any earthly king. As a matter of fact, in verse 2, where it says, the kings of the earth take their stand against  the Lord and his anointed one in Hebrew. You know what the word anointed one is? Mishayak.

The kings of the earth take, they conspire against the Lord and his Messiah. By the way, on just about any subway car you go into now, there's this great big picture  of the Lubavitur Rebbe, Rabbi Schnerson saying, what? Mishayak is coming. Have you been in the subway lately? If you're very, very rich or very poor, you're never in the subway, I suppose.

But for the rest of us, there it is. Mishayak is coming. The anointed one is coming. He says, be ready. And it's very good advice.

Now look, that's what it's talking about. The Lord has put his Messiah and is installed as Messiah. And therefore we can read this Psalm as talking about that greater David, that greater king. And it actually tells us three things. It tells us, now lay these principles out and we'll just examine them.

The middle section from verse 4 to verse 9 tells us that we have a true king, a king above  all the kings, a king behind all the kings. We have a true king, installed by God, my king he says. Then verses 1 to 3 tell us, however, also that human beings hate the king. We have a true king, but we hate that true king. And verses 10, 11 and 12 are extremely practical.

They are a summons to us to see that though we have a king and we hate the king, we need  the king. We'll never find blessedness without the king. We must serve and we must rejoice and we must kiss the king. And so there's the three points. We have a king, we hate the king, we need the king.

Okay. Let's go. Number one, we have a king. God says, here's all these kings around, but there's a king above the kings. There's a king behind all the kings.

There's my king, the true king that I have installed. One of the things is so incredibly interesting about the literature of the human race is  how many ancient legends in all of our cultures kind of go like this. There was a great king who ruled with wisdom and power and justice and compassion all  at once. And therefore, when the king was there, the land experienced a golden age and everyone  blossomed. And we all reached our potential, the land blossomed, the arts blossomed, a relationships  blossomed, civilization blossomed, but something has taken the king away and everything  has deteriorated.

Everything has fallen into decay, but we look for the day in which the king will come back. Do you know how many of our legends are like that, distinguishing? You have the Robinhood legend, where here's Robinhood fighting because the good king has  gone and now darkness has descended on the land and he's fighting just to keep the flame  alive until the good king can come back. You have the great Arthur stories, the king Arthur, Camelot. When Arthur was ruling, there was Camelot, but now he's gone.

And supposedly on his tombstone, it says, here lies Arthur, Rex quantum, Rex futurist,  meaning the once and future king, not just the once, but the future king. See, that's critical behind all the legends. There was a great king and when he was here, everything was great and he's gone, when will  he come back? When you even have one of the most successful and powerful modern legends, a legend written  in the 20th century is Lord of the Rings, all the legends in that cycle written by J.R.  are talking and actually behind all of them, any of you who have read them know that  in many, many ways the basic theme is that there's a true king and he's hidden in the north,  but he's going to show up. And when he does, everything will blossom, right?

The hands of the king are healing hands and thus shall the rightful king be known. And on and on, it goes. Now why, why all these legends, when the actual record of human kings is absolutely abysmal? The actual record of human kings is nothing but a record of tyranny and of tragedy and  of slavery and it's been so that all human practically every single monarchy has been  toppled and in its place have been put some kind of democracy. And as a result, you know, Christians and by the way, with the great one of the great  things about the four-clock service as you can ask more questions, afterwards we have  a question, answer time afterwards, Christians have been part historically of trying to topple  tyrants and kings and put in place democracy.

But the question that comes up is in spite of that, why this fascination with kings? Why do the old legends have such powerful impact on us? And not only that, why do they still have powerful impact on us? Why is it that in the countries that still have some kind of royalty left, some kind of  royal line, that the people are obsessed with the royalty? Why is it that in lands like America where there is no king, there is no royal line, we  have to create them.

So we take billionaires and we take athletes and we take media stars and we even take criminals  and we turn them in to kings. We crown them, they hold court, we adore them. Why is it that there's a significant, significant part of the population that's constantly giving  themselves over the sway of dynamic, charismatic figures who abuse them? Why is there this need for kings? Why is there this need to crown them?

Why is there this need to create them? Why is there this need to adore them? Now I can't get into it too far. That's what I'm saying, afterwards somebody might want to ask me about this. Christians know the Bible knows that democracy is medicine, not food.

We can't live on medicine. It's medicine. We have to have democracy because human beings are so sinful that none of us really are fit  to rule. But we need a king. We are built for a king.

The reason for the old myth, the reason for the new myths, all the superhero myths are  new myths about kings. The reason we adore kings and create them is because there's a memory trace in the  human race. There's a memory trace in you and me of a great king, an ancient king, one who did rule  with such power and wisdom and compassion and justice and glory so that his power and  wisdom and compassion and glory were like the sun shining in full strength. We know that we were built to submit to that king. We were built to give ourselves to that king.

We were built to stand before and adore and serve and know that king. That's what the Bible says. The Bible says there is a king above the kings. There is a king behind the kings. There is a king beneath all of those legends that even the greatest kings are just dim reflections  of the memory trace in us.

And the Bible says, if you reject the true king, you will find a king because you have to. Even if you reject the idea that there's a true king intellectually, you can't reject  it ontologically. You can't reject it in your being. You can't reject it psychologically. You will find someone to adore.

You will find saviors. You will find kings. You will adore one of the most poignant things I've read in the last month. Jeffrey Schmals was a writer for the New York Times and he was suffering with AIDS. And he wrote about it for over at least a year and he just died this fall.

And just two, three weeks ago, they published his last column in the New York Times magazine  on the Sunday and it was a fascinating column because what he wrote, he said, he was embarrassed  to admit it but he admitted it publicly. He says, before this last presidential election, I'm just so embarrassed, I felt that if I could  just get a Democrat into the White House, I'd be saved. He says, I looked at this candidate and I said, this is my White Knight. These are his words. This will be my savior.

He'll get all the resources together. He'll find a cure and he realizes months later what an idiot had been, how naive he'd been,  how could he feel that way? Things really aren't nearly as simple as that. Well, it's just what we're talking about here. The Bible says, you will find a king.

You will find a White Knight. You will find a savior. You've got to. It's in your blood. It's in a memory trace.

King Arthur, Robin Hood, Good King Richard, a Democrat in the White House, or somebody  you're sure with someday comes along and sweeps you off your feet romantically and someone  who will save you, you need a king. And if you don't find the real king, you're going to create a false king and it's going  to poison your life. My dear friends, your physical nature will be served. If you deny your physical nature food, it will gobble poison eventually. It'll eat anything.

And if you deny your spiritual nature, the king that it needs, it will gobble something. It'll gobble poison, but it will gobble. God says, I have set my king in Zion. I give my king the whole earth. In the book of Hebrews, Psalm 2 is quoted.

And Hebrews says, you know, to what earthly king or even angel could God truly say, you  are my God and Son. To what angel, or what earthly king, or even what angel would God say, all of the ends  of the earth are your possession. Hebrews says, is this just courtly hyperbole? Is this just another one of the kinds of, is this just the flattery you have to heap on  an earthly king at his coronation, just the sort of thing that was done? Or is it possible that God has literally and fully said this to somebody?

Is it possible that there's a real king above the kings, a real king behind the kings? And in the New Testament, the gospel message, the message of Christianity is, yes, there is. There is one. Not only one, the Messiah, Messiah gets coming, the Christ, the Lord has anointed one. That's the first point.

There is a king, a true king. But secondly, we're taught here in verses one to three, that the natural heart of every  human being hates the true king. So you have down here in verse one, two, and three, why do the nations conspire and the  people's plot in vain? The kings of the earth take their stand, and the rulers gather together against the Lord  as an anointed. Here's what they say.

Let us break their chains, they say, and throw off their fetters. Now that's the translation we've printed out there, the New International Translation. Well, what does it mean? Probably when you read it the way it's translated, you get the impression that the Lord and  the anointed ones have the kings of the earth in chains like captives thrown in prison. That's really probably a poor translation.

Now, as I was studying this, I came to realize, for people who know he grew a whole lot  better than I do, the problem with that second word should be translated, yoke. The kings of the earth are not upset because they're prisoners and that they have chains  on them. The kings of the earth are upset because they have an owner. A yoke is something you put on the oxen or a harness is something you put on your horse. And the idea here is, there is someone who owns them.

There is someone who demands that they be yoked. There is someone who demands that because they are owned and they have been created, that  therefore the creator has rights over them. And that's what they want to have nothing to do with. They say, I want to be my own. Now, this is teaching us, verse 3, that this is the basic impulse of every human heart.

I think it was George McDonald, he was a Scottish writer who inspired C. S. Lewis. George McDonald said there's one conviction, the central conviction of hell is, I am my  own. Now I think what he means is, that's the one conviction that everybody in hell shares.

But also, it's the one conviction that creates hell. It's the one conviction that will create a hell in your relationships, a hell in your  marriage, a hell in the neighborhood, a hell in the community, a hell in your life. If you operate on this principle, I am my own. Get the yoke off. I belong to no one but myself, you see, I am the captain of my own soul, I am the master  of my fate.

That, this is George McDonald, is the essence of what every human being feels. You feel it from the beginning, if you're trying to raise any children, you know exactly,  that that is something that completely affects and dominates the thoughts and the feelings  and the decisions and the worldview of every human being as they grow up. I am my own. Take off the yoke. And the Bible therefore says that we hate the idea of a king.

We hate the idea of someone who has rights over us. We hate the idea of a king who has a yoke on us who says, you belong to me. You are not your own, you must do as I say. And that's the reason why the Bible says that human beings don't just disbelieve in God,  we hate him. Jonathan Edwards wrote a whole book on this subject, he called him, and the name of it  was men, naturally, God's enemies.

And it's based on passages like Romans 8, where it says, the natural mind is enmity with  God. You know, there really was a sermon once, it was a sermon in 19th century Britain that  ended like this, these were the last words, oh my friends, if virtue incarnate would only  appear on earth, we would fall down in worship. That's pretty incredibly stupid, isn't it? Because you know virtue incarnate did appear on earth, and what did we do? We ran, we choked him, we hid him, we nailed him, we whipped him, we killed him.

Why take this yoke off my neck? That we all hate the king. There's a true king, but we hate him. You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger  brother. In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who  try to earn his love by being good.

In his book The prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart  of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental  older brother and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal, extravagant grace. Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith, the prodigal God will help  you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way. The prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel and life share  the hope and joy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the  world. List your copy today at gospel and life dot com slash give that's gospel and life dot com  slash give now here's doctor Keller with the rest of today's teaching. Now before I move on, I just I need to respond to the normal kinds of objections that people  always give and they raise and they they're understandable objections.

People say that's silly that's that's that's that's that's a pretty truly hyperbole. You know preachers like to over dramatize everything and and so on and sure there's a lot  of people who are indifferent to God. There's a lot of people who don't obey God like they should be but the average person is  not hostile. The average person doesn't hate God doesn't hate God and and conspire and plot against  him. Oh, really?

Let me give you a couple of it. Let me answer the two basic objection one people say most people really believe in God. Michael Kinzley in the new republic wrote an interesting editorial. He'd been hearing so many people say that America was getting more and more hostile to religion. And so he wrote an interesting article saying he says that's really bull.

He says he says I know that that some places like Washington DC and Manhattan and places  like that. There's a lot of people who don't believe in God but an over 95% of all Americans believe  in God and he says in this country is it easier to get up in public and say I don't believe  in God or is it easier to get up in public and say I do. Now of course it depends on whether you're in Manhattan or Peoria. I'm sure but his point was he was saying hey it's popular to believe in God. Most people believe in God people aren't hostile toward God people aren't hostile toward  religion.

This is a very religious country. He's wrong. Because actually he's defined things wrong. The Bible doesn't say people are hostile toward the concept of God or toward the idea of  God. No, no, no.

But the Bible says people hate the biblical God. You see it's the biblical God that thunders from Mount Sinai and says be holy for I am holy. Have no other gods before me. It's the God who thunders and says I will buy no means clear the guilty or it's the  God who sets the biblical God gives us the Messiah and the Messiah shows up and what does  the Messiah say? He said you cannot be my disciple unless you hate your mother and father.

You know what that means? He says you must love me so much that any feelings you have toward anyone else will  look like hatred by comparison. That's how much you have to love me. I have to be supreme in your life. I have to be number one in your life.

I must have total control of every dimension of your being. God says that's the God of the Bible who puts a yoke on you and says I own you. I am your creator. You belong to me. That's the kind of God the Bible says the people hate.

And surely there's some people here that are squarming as I talk like that. You know, your back is starting to get up. You say oh my gosh, what a primitive view I breast my case. That's the normal way a person reacts to the depiction, to the expression, to the revelation  of the God of the Bible, not just God in general. You know, if I start talking like that, do you believe in the biblical God?

The God that thunderstorms on I be holy as I am holy, which is I will by no means clear  to guilty. What's the average person say? Who does 95% of the people who say they believe in God? You know what they say? They say, well, I believe in a God of love.

I rest my case. The Bible says we hate the God who is the king. We hate the God who says you are my possession. All the ends of the earth are my possession. See, verse eight, I own you.

Here's the yoke. That's the God that we reject. And careful, one more mistake you might make. Some people say, oh, okay, so the people who hate the king are skeptics or people who  have rejected religion or rejected Christianity, not necessarily. Don't forget this.

Here's a great place in one of Flannery O'Connor's stories where she says there was a deep,  black, black, wordless conviction in him that the way to avoid Jesus was to avoid sin. I've never gotten over that. Such a great line. Such an insight. Now, I've used it before, but let me show you how I apply it here.

She says, here's a guy who's very religious. He figures that the way to avoid Jesus is to be as good and as moral as possible. Why? You see, many people use religion to avoid Jesus. They use religion to avoid the king.

Let me put it to you like this. Do you believe you're a pretty decent person? Do you believe you're better than most? Do you believe you're pretty straight shooter that you've got moral standards and you stick  with them? Do you feel like if God showed up now and he was going to decide who he was going to  accept into his heaven that you would feel like you'd have as good a chance as anybody?

Or do you believe that you are such a helpless sinner that you have absolutely no hope  of ever being received by God except that Jesus died for you, that you have no hope  except for the mercy of God which was shown in Jesus Christ? Do you think you're a helpless sinner or do you think? Frankly, you're a fairly moral person to friends. Don't you see? You're using morality.

If it's the former, you're using morality to avoid Jesus. You keep from having to really be dependent on him, to keep from having to really submit  to him. I tell you this, either through morality and religion or through skepticism and licentious  living, people hate the king and they express that hatred by trying to avoid the king and  they deny and repress their very anger. So here's, we have to move on here, but here's a concluding little point about this. How do you know if you're a Christian, how do you even know if the Holy Spirit's working  in your life like this?

Do you know you hate God? Have you seen your hatred? Have you seen that there's an enmity in your life against God? Have you seen how much you hate the yoke? When you hear Herod in Jesus Christ's superstar saying, get out, you king, get out of my life.

Do you know that that's the words of your own heart? If you know that you hate God, if you know that that's a big part of your heart, that  proves you're a Christian because only Christians know that. Only Christians can admit that. Only the Holy Spirit can allow you to surface that repressed traumatic material. If you don't admit today that you're an enemy of God, you're really an enemy of God.

The only way to become his friend is to admit you're his enemy. The only way to know that God's Holy Spirit's working in your life is if you're able  to see that resentment, we have a king, we hate the king, lastly, thirdly, we need the  king. Verses 10, 11 and 12 says, look, if you see you have the king, and you also see you hate  the king, the only recourse you have is to persuade, is to be persuaded, I'll explain  that, to be persuaded that you need the king. Serve the king, kiss the king, rejoice in the king. But you see, what Verses 10, 11 and 12 says, there's no in between.

You can either serve and rejoice and kiss the king, and you'll find a refuge in him and  be blessed. Or you won't serve, you won't rejoice, and you won't kiss the king, and you will perish. You will be destroyed in your way. Where you stand is a tremendous statement. The saying is, there is no refuge from the king.

There's only refuge in the king. See, no in between. There's no refuge from the king, only refuge in the king. You need the king. You have to be persuaded of that, let me put it to you this way.

The principle of Verses 10, 11 and 12 is that the yoke eventually becomes a refuge,  that confinement eventually becomes spaciousness, that service eventually becomes freedom, that  if you pull the yoke off of your back, because you think it's bondage and slavery, you will  find that you will perish. You need that yoke. In fact, the yoke is the only way to get you into freedom. So, you know, just maybe a perfect illustration, let's just say here's a young lady, and  she wants to be a great musician. So how do you, maybe you or maybe she, maybe if you're her parents or something, you see  this great artistic gift in her, and you want that artistic gift to realize, well, what do  you do?

The yoke, she's yoke to her piano, hours every day. Some days she wants to go, some days she doesn't want, some days she likes to practice,  some days she doesn't want to practice, but every day she's yoke to the piano, she's  yoke to her practice, and as time goes on, the yoke becomes a refuge. You see, as time goes on, her artistic skill starts to blossom, as time goes on, she begins  to be able to express herself in a way that she never could have otherwise if she hadn't  gone through the routine and let's face it, the drudgery of practice. The yoke becomes a refuge. The yoke becomes blessedness, and let me tell you, there's nothing more tragic to have  a kid come to you and say, mom, dad, why didn't you make me practice?

Why didn't you make me study? My potential is ruined, my chances have gone by. Why didn't you make me? And the only thing to say to a kid is this, because you know, ultimately you can't make  somebody do that. The yoke always has to be eventually received by you.

You have to take it on. I couldn't, you say, make you practice. I couldn't make you study. I couldn't show you that the yoke was the way to free them. There's nothing more tragic than that.

All right, see how the analogy works? The Bible says that in every human being there are potential, there's potential. There are things. You will blossom if you come into the king and places you didn't know your head buds. You've got potential that only will come if you come in under the yoke, under the yoke  of the king.

To believe and obey and love a king means you can find yourself. It means you no longer in charge of your life. But that's the same. You're yoke. That's the way it is.

That's what it means to come in under a king. The Bible says, because you need a king, you can't understand yourself psychologically,  you can't understand yourself culturally. You can't understand yourself unless you see that you're driven by this need for a king. You're trying to get back to Camelot. And there's no alternative for you.

And therefore unless you submit yourself to what you were built for, you will perish in  the way. Do you see that until you submit to the king, the king, until you give yourself to him  utterly and completely? Your heart, the Bible says, is like an eight-cylinder engine running on one cylinder. Have you ever tried that? It spits and it costs and it lurches and it halts and it's terrible, don't you see?

You're two deepest needs. You need to feel that you count, that you're accomplishing something and you need to feel  that you're loved, that you're valuable to someone. And when you serve the king and you kiss the king, those two needs, and only then are  those two needs satisfied because when you serve him, he serves you and when you kiss him,  he kisses you. That's the way it is in a relationship. And then oh, blessed are they who take refuge in him.

Now let me just conclude by giving you a couple of fairly practical examples here. The Bible gives us right here in verse 10, 11 and 12 of what it really means to submit  to the king. Let me just give you three. Actually let me give you four and afterwards I'm going to be real brief about it and if  people want me to draw them out, you can draw them out afterwards in the question and  answer time. How do you treat Jesus as a king?

A lot of you have believed in Jesus in the general way. A lot of you have even asked Jesus for help in your life but you're not treating him as  a king. And this is the reason why you're not seeing the blessedness in your life. You're not treating him as a king. If you want to treat him as a king, you've got to do four things.

Obey, submit, rely and expect. Obey, submit, rely and expect. Look. Obey. Maybe that's too easy.

Maybe I shouldn't spend much time on it, but wait. To obey. Some of you think you're obeying and you're not. If you say, okay, here's the rules. Look at all the things that the king says.

Always forgive, always. Always tell the truth, always. Always return, never return evil for evil, but always return evil for good. Use sex as a commitment, a covenant renewal ceremony for a permanent exclusive marriage  contract. Don't envy.

Don't be bitter and so on. Now there they are. Look, nobody in this room, none of us, are going to be perfect at keeping those up. But there's a difference between someone who is real at Jesus' being king and there's  a difference between someone who is making Jesus nothing but a consultant. You see, it's one thing that when I come to somebody, some of you are bitter right now,  some of you are mad at people and you won't let go.

You're playing the tapes. You won't forgive. You know you should, but you won't. You're going to perish in the way. You're trying to throw the yoke off of yourself.

Don't you see? His yoke is easy. His burden is light. If you forgive, if you obey and forgive, it'll heal you because there's a difference. I can sometimes go to people and say, I can see that you're not forgiving.

Yes, they say. What are you going to do about it? A Christian always says, I need help. I know it's wrong. I refuse.

I'm not doing it. I've got to do it. What do I do? But there's another kind of person that says, yes, I know it's wrong, but this person deserves  it. Don't tell me how to run my life.

If you say, I'll obey, if it feels good, I'll obey if it's practical, I'll obey if it's  popular, I'll obey if it's pragmatic. You're not obeying at all. Jesus is not in your life as a king. Jesus is in your life as a consultant. He is giving you recommendations and you're deciding who to sleep with and you're deciding  when to forgive and you're deciding what you're going to do and what you're not going to  do.

He's only a consultant. He won't come that way. How dare you treat him that way. Look at who he is. You mustn't obey.

Treat him as a king. You have to obey him. You have to say, not my will, but mine be done. Number two, to treat him as a king, you have to accept. Submit to the way in which he's ordering your life.

This is harder. That's what I'm mentioning it, bro, brief. Some people are very obedient as to what he actually says, but when God lets things come  into your life, that you just think, this isn't right, this isn't fair. Look at how he's letting the circumstances of my life go. You won't treat him as a king then.

You know what it means to treat him as a king? To say, you must know what best. Oh, it doesn't mean that you just put a cheery smile on your face and you say, I'm just  praising Jesus. Everything is just fine. I'm sure he knows what's best in that sense.

You have to wrestle and you have to struggle. But you know, you have to be like Job. There's one great place in Job chapter 23. In one of his better times and all of his wrestling, he says, I don't sense God's presence. But the things God is allowing to happen, fill me with terror.

But quote, he knows my way and when he has tested me, I will come forth as pure gold. But he knows my way and when he has tested me, I will come forth as pure gold. You know what he's doing there? He's accepting the kingship of Jesus in his life, he's saying, I don't understand what's  going on and it terrifies me and I wrestle, but I know that if I respond obediently, if  I accept what he's giving me, if I am faithful in the midst of this great fiery furnace, I  will come forth as pure gold. I'll be a humbler.

I'll be more sensitive. I'll be more loving. I'll be more compassionate. He is submits to the fact that his circumstances are purifying. Do you give Jesus the kingship like that?

Okay. Number one, after obey. Number two, you have to submit, accept the circumstances. Number three, you have to rely on him when he says, kiss the sun. You know what that means?

If you add anything to Jesus as a requirement for being happy, if you add anything to Jesus  as a requirement for being happy, that's your real king. You see, if you say, I'll be happy to become a Christian as long as these things go in  my life, very often, you come to Christianity because something is going wrong in an area  of your life, something that really is important to you, something that's your real king. And you go to Jesus and you say, I'm going to do this in this for you, but will you please  get me that? And if your life doesn't go right in that direction, if those things don't happen to you,  you're ready to throw the whole thing over and say, in vain have I kept my hands pure. In vain have I washed my hands and my heart and innocence.

What does it mean to kiss the king? It means to obey him and submit to him because you're ravished with his beauty. It means to say there is nothing I love more than my king. It means I won't make my king a means to an end, but the king's love is enough in itself. And lastly, obey, submit, rely, one more thing, expect, rejoice with trembling.

What does that mean? I believe that if you are too pessimistic with regards to what Jesus can do in your life,  you're not treating him as a king. You have to have the expectations that are worthy of a king. You've got a king coming into your life. You know there's a place where John Newton says, Valorate coming to a king, large petitions  with the bring for his grace and power are such none can ever ask too much.

Do you treat him like a king or do you look at the problems in your life and say nothing's  ever going to happen there? That's always going to be. That's the way things are always going to be. Valorate coming to a king, large petitions with the bring for his grace and power are such  none can ever ask too much. What do you see if you're pessimistic about what I can do in your life and what I can  do through you, you are not treating him as a king.

Can you serve him? Can you obey him? Can you kiss him? Can you rejoice with trembling? There's no refuge from him, but there's a tremendous refuge in him.

Blessed are those who find refuge in the king. Let's pray. Father, we ask now that as we think about these things, because it's your word, that your  spirit would come and open our hearts to how we should be applying these things, I pray  that everybody here might find that as they come and they kiss the king and they obey  out of love for him, that they'll find that the lives are opening up. They forgive us for wanting to pull the yoke off. Show us that the yoke becomes a refuge, that confinement becomes spaciousness, that service,  your service is our perfect freedom.

It's in Jesus' name we pray, amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today's teaching, Tim Keller impacts how Jesus actively seeks us, reveals truth to  us, and calls us to Himself. I'm going to read you from Psalm 2, our teaching, this afternoon it's taken from Psalm 2. It's all printed in your bulletin. It's a shorter Psalm than we have been, seems like looking at recently, we've been looking  at very long Psalms, this is only 12 verses, and I'll read it first. Why do the nations conspire and the people's plot in vain?

The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against the Lord  and against his anointed one. Let us break their chains, they say, and throw off their fetters. The one enthroned in heaven laughs. The Lord scoffs at them. Then He rebukes them in His anger and terrifies them in His wrath, saying, I have installed  my king on Zion, my holy hill.

I will proclaim the decree of the Lord. He said to me, you are my son, today I have become your father, ask of me, and I will  make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession. You will rule them with an iron scepter, you will dash them to pieces like pottery. Therefore, you kings, be wise, be warned you rulers of the earth, serve the Lord with fear  and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the sun, less TB angry, and you will be destroyed in your way.

For His wrath can flare up in a moment, blessed are all who take refuge in Him. This is God's word. It's an advent, as we approach Christmas, we ask ourselves, what did Jesus Christ come  to do? And we've been answering this question last week, this week, next week, by looking at some  of the Psalms, we've been looking at the Psalms all fall. And I think I mentioned last week that some Psalms have been understood by the Christian  Church as Messianic Psalms, they're called Messianic Psalms, because Jesus Himself picked  out a few, some Psalms, and He said, you know this Psalm, like we said last week, John  chapter 15, He quotes from Psalm 69, and He says, you know, this Psalm talks about David,  he talks about the Psalmist, and the immediate environment of the Psalmist, but it's also  foreshadowing and talking about me.

And these particular Psalms, therefore, can be read on two levels. They have, in a sense, two horizons, two reference. They've got the reference to the immediate historical context of the person writing the  Psalm, but they've also got an ultimate reference to a greater David than David, a greater  king than this king, a greater warrior, a greater suffering servant, and so on. Now this particular Psalm is a coronation Psalm. If you read it carefully, you'll see that it actually consists of several stanzas, and  it has to do with the a session of someone to the throne of Israel.

And it can be read, obviously, just on that level. You see, someone in David's line, this could either be David, it might have been originally  written when David was crowned, but it certainly was also used in other situations when descendants  of David were installed as king. And in the beginning, it talks about the nations of the earth plotting against the king. Well, it's natural that if you became a king in those days, you had a whole lot of hostile  neighbors who couldn't wait to test out just what kind of king you really were, what kind  of general you really were, which was the same thing. And therefore, the context of the Psalm is God is seen as installing the king in Israel  on Zion, which was one of the hills.

Zion was the original hill in Jerusalem on which the original Jebiusite city, the Jebiusite's  built a city in Jerusalem before the Israelites built a city. And so Zion was just simply another way of talking about the entire city of Jerusalem. So here in Jerusalem, the king has been installed, but all the foreign hostile kings are conspiring  against this king. So the Psalmist says, be warned. God is with him.

God is going to take care of him. He will give, God will give us aid. And that's how you can read the Psalm at one level. But if you read it carefully, you will see that no earthly king can completely justify  the fury of the threats. And no earthly king can completely justify the glory of the promises, the language you  might say of Psalm 2 spills out over its banks.

If Psalm 2 is a river, the language comes up over top of it. The things that are said about this king, this anointed one, are far too great to really  be confined to any earthly king. As a matter of fact, in verse 2, where it says, the kings of the earth take their stand against  the Lord and his anointed one in Hebrew. You know what the word anointed one is? Mishayak.

The kings of the earth take, they conspire against the Lord and his Messiah. By the way, on just about any subway car you go into now, there's this great big picture  of the Lubavitur Rebbe, Rabbi Schnerson saying, what? Mishayak is coming. Have you been in the subway lately? If you're very, very rich or very poor, you're never in the subway, I suppose.

But for the rest of us, there it is. Mishayak is coming. The anointed one is coming. He says, be ready. And it's very good advice.

Now look, that's what it's talking about. The Lord has put his Messiah and is installed as Messiah. And therefore we can read this Psalm as talking about that greater David, that greater king. And it actually tells us three things. It tells us, now lay these principles out and we'll just examine them.

The middle section from verse 4 to verse 9 tells us that we have a true king, a king above  all the kings, a king behind all the kings. We have a true king, installed by God, my king he says. Then verses 1 to 3 tell us, however, also that human beings hate the king. We have a true king, but we hate that true king. And verses 10, 11 and 12 are extremely practical.

They are a summons to us to see that though we have a king and we hate the king, we need  the king. We'll never find blessedness without the king. We must serve and we must rejoice and we must kiss the king. And so there's the three points. We have a king, we hate the king, we need the king.

Okay. Let's go. Number one, we have a king. God says, here's all these kings around, but there's a king above the kings. There's a king behind all the kings.

There's my king, the true king that I have installed. One of the things is so incredibly interesting about the literature of the human race is  how many ancient legends in all of our cultures kind of go like this. There was a great king who ruled with wisdom and power and justice and compassion all  at once. And therefore, when the king was there, the land experienced a golden age and everyone  blossomed. And we all reached our potential, the land blossomed, the arts blossomed, a relationships  blossomed, civilization blossomed, but something has taken the king away and everything  has deteriorated.

Everything has fallen into decay, but we look for the day in which the king will come back. Do you know how many of our legends are like that, distinguishing? You have the Robinhood legend, where here's Robinhood fighting because the good king has  gone and now darkness has descended on the land and he's fighting just to keep the flame  alive until the good king can come back. You have the great Arthur stories, the king Arthur, Camelot. When Arthur was ruling, there was Camelot, but now he's gone.

And supposedly on his tombstone, it says, here lies Arthur, Rex quantum, Rex futurist,  meaning the once and future king, not just the once, but the future king. See, that's critical behind all the legends. There was a great king and when he was here, everything was great and he's gone, when will  he come back? When you even have one of the most successful and powerful modern legends, a legend written  in the 20th century is Lord of the Rings, all the legends in that cycle written by J.R.  are talking and actually behind all of them, any of you who have read them know that  in many, many ways the basic theme is that there's a true king and he's hidden in the north,  but he's going to show up. And when he does, everything will blossom, right?

The hands of the king are healing hands and thus shall the rightful king be known. And on and on, it goes. Now why, why all these legends, when the actual record of human kings is absolutely abysmal? The actual record of human kings is nothing but a record of tyranny and of tragedy and  of slavery and it's been so that all human practically every single monarchy has been  toppled and in its place have been put some kind of democracy. And as a result, you know, Christians and by the way, with the great one of the great  things about the four-clock service as you can ask more questions, afterwards we have  a question, answer time afterwards, Christians have been part historically of trying to topple  tyrants and kings and put in place democracy.

But the question that comes up is in spite of that, why this fascination with kings? Why do the old legends have such powerful impact on us? And not only that, why do they still have powerful impact on us? Why is it that in the countries that still have some kind of royalty left, some kind of  royal line, that the people are obsessed with the royalty? Why is it that in lands like America where there is no king, there is no royal line, we  have to create them.

So we take billionaires and we take athletes and we take media stars and we even take criminals  and we turn them in to kings. We crown them, they hold court, we adore them. Why is it that there's a significant, significant part of the population that's constantly giving  themselves over the sway of dynamic, charismatic figures who abuse them? Why is there this need for kings? Why is there this need to crown them?

Why is there this need to create them? Why is there this need to adore them? Now I can't get into it too far. That's what I'm saying, afterwards somebody might want to ask me about this. Christians know the Bible knows that democracy is medicine, not food.

We can't live on medicine. It's medicine. We have to have democracy because human beings are so sinful that none of us really are fit  to rule. But we need a king. We are built for a king.

The reason for the old myth, the reason for the new myths, all the superhero myths are  new myths about kings. The reason we adore kings and create them is because there's a memory trace in the  human race. There's a memory trace in you and me of a great king, an ancient king, one who did rule  with such power and wisdom and compassion and justice and glory so that his power and  wisdom and compassion and glory were like the sun shining in full strength. We know that we were built to submit to that king. We were built to give ourselves to that king.

We were built to stand before and adore and serve and know that king. That's what the Bible says. The Bible says there is a king above the kings. There is a king behind the kings. There is a king beneath all of those legends that even the greatest kings are just dim reflections  of the memory trace in us.

And the Bible says, if you reject the true king, you will find a king because you have to. Even if you reject the idea that there's a true king intellectually, you can't reject  it ontologically. You can't reject it in your being. You can't reject it psychologically. You will find someone to adore.

You will find saviors. You will find kings. You will adore one of the most poignant things I've read in the last month. Jeffrey Schmals was a writer for the New York Times and he was suffering with AIDS. And he wrote about it for over at least a year and he just died this fall.

And just two, three weeks ago, they published his last column in the New York Times magazine  on the Sunday and it was a fascinating column because what he wrote, he said, he was embarrassed  to admit it but he admitted it publicly. He says, before this last presidential election, I'm just so embarrassed, I felt that if I could  just get a Democrat into the White House, I'd be saved. He says, I looked at this candidate and I said, this is my White Knight. These are his words. This will be my savior.

He'll get all the resources together. He'll find a cure and he realizes months later what an idiot had been, how naive he'd been,  how could he feel that way? Things really aren't nearly as simple as that. Well, it's just what we're talking about here. The Bible says, you will find a king.

You will find a White Knight. You will find a savior. You've got to. It's in your blood. It's in a memory trace.

King Arthur, Robin Hood, Good King Richard, a Democrat in the White House, or somebody  you're sure with someday comes along and sweeps you off your feet romantically and someone  who will save you, you need a king. And if you don't find the real king, you're going to create a false king and it's going  to poison your life. My dear friends, your physical nature will be served. If you deny your physical nature food, it will gobble poison eventually. It'll eat anything.

And if you deny your spiritual nature, the king that it needs, it will gobble something. It'll gobble poison, but it will gobble. God says, I have set my king in Zion. I give my king the whole earth. In the book of Hebrews, Psalm 2 is quoted.

And Hebrews says, you know, to what earthly king or even angel could God truly say, you  are my God and Son. To what angel, or what earthly king, or even what angel would God say, all of the ends  of the earth are your possession. Hebrews says, is this just courtly hyperbole? Is this just another one of the kinds of, is this just the flattery you have to heap on  an earthly king at his coronation, just the sort of thing that was done? Or is it possible that God has literally and fully said this to somebody?

Is it possible that there's a real king above the kings, a real king behind the kings? And in the New Testament, the gospel message, the message of Christianity is, yes, there is. There is one. Not only one, the Messiah, Messiah gets coming, the Christ, the Lord has anointed one. That's the first point.

There is a king, a true king. But secondly, we're taught here in verses one to three, that the natural heart of every  human being hates the true king. So you have down here in verse one, two, and three, why do the nations conspire and the  people's plot in vain? The kings of the earth take their stand, and the rulers gather together against the Lord  as an anointed. Here's what they say.

Let us break their chains, they say, and throw off their fetters. Now that's the translation we've printed out there, the New International Translation. Well, what does it mean? Probably when you read it the way it's translated, you get the impression that the Lord and  the anointed ones have the kings of the earth in chains like captives thrown in prison. That's really probably a poor translation.

Now, as I was studying this, I came to realize, for people who know he grew a whole lot  better than I do, the problem with that second word should be translated, yoke. The kings of the earth are not upset because they're prisoners and that they have chains  on them. The kings of the earth are upset because they have an owner. A yoke is something you put on the oxen or a harness is something you put on your horse. And the idea here is, there is someone who owns them.

There is someone who demands that they be yoked. There is someone who demands that because they are owned and they have been created, that  therefore the creator has rights over them. And that's what they want to have nothing to do with. They say, I want to be my own. Now, this is teaching us, verse 3, that this is the basic impulse of every human heart.

I think it was George McDonald, he was a Scottish writer who inspired C. S. Lewis. George McDonald said there's one conviction, the central conviction of hell is, I am my  own. Now I think what he means is, that's the one conviction that everybody in hell shares.

But also, it's the one conviction that creates hell. It's the one conviction that will create a hell in your relationships, a hell in your  marriage, a hell in the neighborhood, a hell in the community, a hell in your life. If you operate on this principle, I am my own. Get the yoke off. I belong to no one but myself, you see, I am the captain of my own soul, I am the master  of my fate.

That, this is George McDonald, is the essence of what every human being feels. You feel it from the beginning, if you're trying to raise any children, you know exactly,  that that is something that completely affects and dominates the thoughts and the feelings  and the decisions and the worldview of every human being as they grow up. I am my own. Take off the yoke. And the Bible therefore says that we hate the idea of a king.

We hate the idea of someone who has rights over us. We hate the idea of a king who has a yoke on us who says, you belong to me. You are not your own, you must do as I say. And that's the reason why the Bible says that human beings don't just disbelieve in God,  we hate him. Jonathan Edwards wrote a whole book on this subject, he called him, and the name of it  was men, naturally, God's enemies.

And it's based on passages like Romans 8, where it says, the natural mind is enmity with  God. You know, there really was a sermon once, it was a sermon in 19th century Britain that  ended like this, these were the last words, oh my friends, if virtue incarnate would only  appear on earth, we would fall down in worship. That's pretty incredibly stupid, isn't it? Because you know virtue incarnate did appear on earth, and what did we do? We ran, we choked him, we hid him, we nailed him, we whipped him, we killed him.

Why take this yoke off my neck? That we all hate the king. There's a true king, but we hate him. You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger  brother. In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who  try to earn his love by being good.

In his book The prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart  of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental  older brother and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal, extravagant grace. Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith, the prodigal God will help  you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way. The prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel and life share  the hope and joy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the  world. List your copy today at gospel and life dot com slash give that's gospel and life dot com  slash give now here's doctor Keller with the rest of today's teaching. Now before I move on, I just I need to respond to the normal kinds of objections that people  always give and they raise and they they're understandable objections.

People say that's silly that's that's that's that's that's a pretty truly hyperbole. You know preachers like to over dramatize everything and and so on and sure there's a lot  of people who are indifferent to God. There's a lot of people who don't obey God like they should be but the average person is  not hostile. The average person doesn't hate God doesn't hate God and and conspire and plot against  him. Oh, really?

Let me give you a couple of it. Let me answer the two basic objection one people say most people really believe in God. Michael Kinzley in the new republic wrote an interesting editorial. He'd been hearing so many people say that America was getting more and more hostile to religion. And so he wrote an interesting article saying he says that's really bull.

He says he says I know that that some places like Washington DC and Manhattan and places  like that. There's a lot of people who don't believe in God but an over 95% of all Americans believe  in God and he says in this country is it easier to get up in public and say I don't believe  in God or is it easier to get up in public and say I do. Now of course it depends on whether you're in Manhattan or Peoria. I'm sure but his point was he was saying hey it's popular to believe in God. Most people believe in God people aren't hostile toward God people aren't hostile toward  religion.

This is a very religious country. He's wrong. Because actually he's defined things wrong. The Bible doesn't say people are hostile toward the concept of God or toward the idea of  God. No, no, no.

But the Bible says people hate the biblical God. You see it's the biblical God that thunders from Mount Sinai and says be holy for I am holy. Have no other gods before me. It's the God who thunders and says I will buy no means clear the guilty or it's the  God who sets the biblical God gives us the Messiah and the Messiah shows up and what does  the Messiah say? He said you cannot be my disciple unless you hate your mother and father.

You know what that means? He says you must love me so much that any feelings you have toward anyone else will  look like hatred by comparison. That's how much you have to love me. I have to be supreme in your life. I have to be number one in your life.

I must have total control of every dimension of your being. God says that's the God of the Bible who puts a yoke on you and says I own you. I am your creator. You belong to me. That's the kind of God the Bible says the people hate.

And surely there's some people here that are squarming as I talk like that. You know, your back is starting to get up. You say oh my gosh, what a primitive view I breast my case. That's the normal way a person reacts to the depiction, to the expression, to the revelation  of the God of the Bible, not just God in general. You know, if I start talking like that, do you believe in the biblical God?

The God that thunderstorms on I be holy as I am holy, which is I will by no means clear  to guilty. What's the average person say? Who does 95% of the people who say they believe in God? You know what they say? They say, well, I believe in a God of love.

I rest my case. The Bible says we hate the God who is the king. We hate the God who says you are my possession. All the ends of the earth are my possession. See, verse eight, I own you.

Here's the yoke. That's the God that we reject. And careful, one more mistake you might make. Some people say, oh, okay, so the people who hate the king are skeptics or people who  have rejected religion or rejected Christianity, not necessarily. Don't forget this.

Here's a great place in one of Flannery O'Connor's stories where she says there was a deep,  black, black, wordless conviction in him that the way to avoid Jesus was to avoid sin. I've never gotten over that. Such a great line. Such an insight. Now, I've used it before, but let me show you how I apply it here.

She says, here's a guy who's very religious. He figures that the way to avoid Jesus is to be as good and as moral as possible. Why? You see, many people use religion to avoid Jesus. They use religion to avoid the king.

Let me put it to you like this. Do you believe you're a pretty decent person? Do you believe you're better than most? Do you believe you're pretty straight shooter that you've got moral standards and you stick  with them? Do you feel like if God showed up now and he was going to decide who he was going to  accept into his heaven that you would feel like you'd have as good a chance as anybody?

Or do you believe that you are such a helpless sinner that you have absolutely no hope  of ever being received by God except that Jesus died for you, that you have no hope  except for the mercy of God which was shown in Jesus Christ? Do you think you're a helpless sinner or do you think? Frankly, you're a fairly moral person to friends. Don't you see? You're using morality.

If it's the former, you're using morality to avoid Jesus. You keep from having to really be dependent on him, to keep from having to really submit  to him. I tell you this, either through morality and religion or through skepticism and licentious  living, people hate the king and they express that hatred by trying to avoid the king and  they deny and repress their very anger. So here's, we have to move on here, but here's a concluding little point about this. How do you know if you're a Christian, how do you even know if the Holy Spirit's working  in your life like this?

Do you know you hate God? Have you seen your hatred? Have you seen that there's an enmity in your life against God? Have you seen how much you hate the yoke? When you hear Herod in Jesus Christ's superstar saying, get out, you king, get out of my life.

Do you know that that's the words of your own heart? If you know that you hate God, if you know that that's a big part of your heart, that  proves you're a Christian because only Christians know that. Only Christians can admit that. Only the Holy Spirit can allow you to surface that repressed traumatic material. If you don't admit today that you're an enemy of God, you're really an enemy of God.

The only way to become his friend is to admit you're his enemy. The only way to know that God's Holy Spirit's working in your life is if you're able  to see that resentment, we have a king, we hate the king, lastly, thirdly, we need the  king. Verses 10, 11 and 12 says, look, if you see you have the king, and you also see you hate  the king, the only recourse you have is to persuade, is to be persuaded, I'll explain  that, to be persuaded that you need the king. Serve the king, kiss the king, rejoice in the king. But you see, what Verses 10, 11 and 12 says, there's no in between.

You can either serve and rejoice and kiss the king, and you'll find a refuge in him and  be blessed. Or you won't serve, you won't rejoice, and you won't kiss the king, and you will perish. You will be destroyed in your way. Where you stand is a tremendous statement. The saying is, there is no refuge from the king.

There's only refuge in the king. See, no in between. There's no refuge from the king, only refuge in the king. You need the king. You have to be persuaded of that, let me put it to you this way.

The principle of Verses 10, 11 and 12 is that the yoke eventually becomes a refuge,  that confinement eventually becomes spaciousness, that service eventually becomes freedom, that  if you pull the yoke off of your back, because you think it's bondage and slavery, you will  find that you will perish. You need that yoke. In fact, the yoke is the only way to get you into freedom. So, you know, just maybe a perfect illustration, let's just say here's a young lady, and  she wants to be a great musician. So how do you, maybe you or maybe she, maybe if you're her parents or something, you see  this great artistic gift in her, and you want that artistic gift to realize, well, what do  you do?

The yoke, she's yoke to her piano, hours every day. Some days she wants to go, some days she doesn't want, some days she likes to practice,  some days she doesn't want to practice, but every day she's yoke to the piano, she's  yoke to her practice, and as time goes on, the yoke becomes a refuge. You see, as time goes on, her artistic skill starts to blossom, as time goes on, she begins  to be able to express herself in a way that she never could have otherwise if she hadn't  gone through the routine and let's face it, the drudgery of practice. The yoke becomes a refuge. The yoke becomes blessedness, and let me tell you, there's nothing more tragic to have  a kid come to you and say, mom, dad, why didn't you make me practice?

Why didn't you make me study? My potential is ruined, my chances have gone by. Why didn't you make me? And the only thing to say to a kid is this, because you know, ultimately you can't make  somebody do that. The yoke always has to be eventually received by you.

You have to take it on. I couldn't, you say, make you practice. I couldn't make you study. I couldn't show you that the yoke was the way to free them. There's nothing more tragic than that.

All right, see how the analogy works? The Bible says that in every human being there are potential, there's potential. There are things. You will blossom if you come into the king and places you didn't know your head buds. You've got potential that only will come if you come in under the yoke, under the yoke  of the king.

To believe and obey and love a king means you can find yourself. It means you no longer in charge of your life. But that's the same. You're yoke. That's the way it is.

That's what it means to come in under a king. The Bible says, because you need a king, you can't understand yourself psychologically,  you can't understand yourself culturally. You can't understand yourself unless you see that you're driven by this need for a king. You're trying to get back to Camelot. And there's no alternative for you.

And therefore unless you submit yourself to what you were built for, you will perish in  the way. Do you see that until you submit to the king, the king, until you give yourself to him  utterly and completely? Your heart, the Bible says, is like an eight-cylinder engine running on one cylinder. Have you ever tried that? It spits and it costs and it lurches and it halts and it's terrible, don't you see?

You're two deepest needs. You need to feel that you count, that you're accomplishing something and you need to feel  that you're loved, that you're valuable to someone. And when you serve the king and you kiss the king, those two needs, and only then are  those two needs satisfied because when you serve him, he serves you and when you kiss him,  he kisses you. That's the way it is in a relationship. And then oh, blessed are they who take refuge in him.

Now let me just conclude by giving you a couple of fairly practical examples here. The Bible gives us right here in verse 10, 11 and 12 of what it really means to submit  to the king. Let me just give you three. Actually let me give you four and afterwards I'm going to be real brief about it and if  people want me to draw them out, you can draw them out afterwards in the question and  answer time. How do you treat Jesus as a king?

A lot of you have believed in Jesus in the general way. A lot of you have even asked Jesus for help in your life but you're not treating him as  a king. And this is the reason why you're not seeing the blessedness in your life. You're not treating him as a king. If you want to treat him as a king, you've got to do four things.

Obey, submit, rely and expect. Obey, submit, rely and expect. Look. Obey. Maybe that's too easy.

Maybe I shouldn't spend much time on it, but wait. To obey. Some of you think you're obeying and you're not. If you say, okay, here's the rules. Look at all the things that the king says.

Always forgive, always. Always tell the truth, always. Always return, never return evil for evil, but always return evil for good. Use sex as a commitment, a covenant renewal ceremony for a permanent exclusive marriage  contract. Don't envy.

Don't be bitter and so on. Now there they are. Look, nobody in this room, none of us, are going to be perfect at keeping those up. But there's a difference between someone who is real at Jesus' being king and there's  a difference between someone who is making Jesus nothing but a consultant. You see, it's one thing that when I come to somebody, some of you are bitter right now,  some of you are mad at people and you won't let go.

You're playing the tapes. You won't forgive. You know you should, but you won't. You're going to perish in the way. You're trying to throw the yoke off of yourself.

Don't you see? His yoke is easy. His burden is light. If you forgive, if you obey and forgive, it'll heal you because there's a difference. I can sometimes go to people and say, I can see that you're not forgiving.

Yes, they say. What are you going to do about it? A Christian always says, I need help. I know it's wrong. I refuse.

I'm not doing it. I've got to do it. What do I do? But there's another kind of person that says, yes, I know it's wrong, but this person deserves  it. Don't tell me how to run my life.

If you say, I'll obey, if it feels good, I'll obey if it's practical, I'll obey if it's  popular, I'll obey if it's pragmatic. You're not obeying at all. Jesus is not in your life as a king. Jesus is in your life as a consultant. He is giving you recommendations and you're deciding who to sleep with and you're deciding  when to forgive and you're deciding what you're going to do and what you're not going to  do.

He's only a consultant. He won't come that way. How dare you treat him that way. Look at who he is. You mustn't obey.

Treat him as a king. You have to obey him. You have to say, not my will, but mine be done. Number two, to treat him as a king, you have to accept. Submit to the way in which he's ordering your life.

This is harder. That's what I'm mentioning it, bro, brief. Some people are very obedient as to what he actually says, but when God lets things come  into your life, that you just think, this isn't right, this isn't fair. Look at how he's letting the circumstances of my life go. You won't treat him as a king then.

You know what it means to treat him as a king? To say, you must know what best. Oh, it doesn't mean that you just put a cheery smile on your face and you say, I'm just  praising Jesus. Everything is just fine. I'm sure he knows what's best in that sense.

You have to wrestle and you have to struggle. But you know, you have to be like Job. There's one great place in Job chapter 23. In one of his better times and all of his wrestling, he says, I don't sense God's presence. But the things God is allowing to happen, fill me with terror.

But quote, he knows my way and when he has tested me, I will come forth as pure gold. But he knows my way and when he has tested me, I will come forth as pure gold. You know what he's doing there? He's accepting the kingship of Jesus in his life, he's saying, I don't understand what's  going on and it terrifies me and I wrestle, but I know that if I respond obediently, if  I accept what he's giving me, if I am faithful in the midst of this great fiery furnace, I  will come forth as pure gold. I'll be a humbler.

I'll be more sensitive. I'll be more loving. I'll be more compassionate. He is submits to the fact that his circumstances are purifying. Do you give Jesus the kingship like that?

Okay. Number one, after obey. Number two, you have to submit, accept the circumstances. Number three, you have to rely on him when he says, kiss the sun. You know what that means?

If you add anything to Jesus as a requirement for being happy, if you add anything to Jesus  as a requirement for being happy, that's your real king. You see, if you say, I'll be happy to become a Christian as long as these things go in  my life, very often, you come to Christianity because something is going wrong in an area  of your life, something that really is important to you, something that's your real king. And you go to Jesus and you say, I'm going to do this in this for you, but will you please  get me that? And if your life doesn't go right in that direction, if those things don't happen to you,  you're ready to throw the whole thing over and say, in vain have I kept my hands pure. In vain have I washed my hands and my heart and innocence.

What does it mean to kiss the king? It means to obey him and submit to him because you're ravished with his beauty. It means to say there is nothing I love more than my king. It means I won't make my king a means to an end, but the king's love is enough in itself. And lastly, obey, submit, rely, one more thing, expect, rejoice with trembling.

What does that mean? I believe that if you are too pessimistic with regards to what Jesus can do in your life,  you're not treating him as a king. You have to have the expectations that are worthy of a king. You've got a king coming into your life. You know there's a place where John Newton says, Valorate coming to a king, large petitions  with the bring for his grace and power are such none can ever ask too much.

Do you treat him like a king or do you look at the problems in your life and say nothing's  ever going to happen there? That's always going to be. That's the way things are always going to be. Valorate coming to a king, large petitions with the bring for his grace and power are such  none can ever ask too much. What do you see if you're pessimistic about what I can do in your life and what I can  do through you, you are not treating him as a king.

Can you serve him? Can you obey him? Can you kiss him? Can you rejoice with trembling? There's no refuge from him, but there's a tremendous refuge in him.

Blessed are those who find refuge in the king. Let's pray. Father, we ask now that as we think about these things, because it's your word, that your  spirit would come and open our hearts to how we should be applying these things, I pray  that everybody here might find that as they come and they kiss the king and they obey  out of love for him, that they'll find that the lives are opening up. They forgive us for wanting to pull the yoke off. Show us that the yoke becomes a refuge, that confinement becomes spaciousness, that service,  your service is our perfect freedom.

It's in Jesus' name we pray, amen.

### 中文翻译

在今天的教导中，Tim Keller讲述了耶稣如何积极地寻找我们，向我们揭示真理，并呼召我们归向祂。我要从诗篇第二篇为你们诵读，今天下午的教导取自诗篇第二篇。全文都印在你们的周报上。这是一篇比我们最近看的诗篇更短的诗篇，我们最近一直在看很长的诗篇，这篇只有12节，我先来读一下。

> 外邦为什么争闹？万民为什么谋算虚妄的事？世上的君王一齐起来，臣宰一同商议，要敌挡耶和华并他的受膏者，说：我们要挣开他们的捆绑，脱去他们的绳索。那坐在天上的必发笑；主必嗤笑他们。那时他要在怒中责备他们，在烈怒中惊吓他们，说：我已经立我的君在锡安我的圣山上了。

> 我要传圣旨。耶和华曾对我说：你是我的儿子，我今日生你。你求我，我就将列国赐你为基业，将地极赐你为田产。你必用铁杖打破他们；你必将他们如同窑匠的瓦器摔碎。现在，你们君王应当省悟！你们世上的审判官该受管教！当存畏惧事奉耶和华，又当存战兢而快乐。当以嘴亲子，恐怕他发怒，你们便在道中灭亡，因为他的怒气快要发作。凡投靠他的，都是有福的。

这是神的话语。当圣诞节临近时，我们问自己，耶稣基督来是要做什么？我们上周、这周和下周都在通过查考一些诗篇来回答这个问题，我们整个秋天都在查看诗篇。我想我上周提到过，有些诗篇被基督教会理解为弥赛亚诗篇，它们被称为弥赛亚诗篇，因为耶稣自己挑选了几篇，他说，你们知道这篇诗篇，就像我们上周说的，约翰福音第15章，他引用诗篇69篇，他说，你们知道，这篇诗篇谈到大卫，谈到诗篇作者和诗篇作者当时的处境，但它也预示和谈到了我。

因此，这些特定的诗篇可以在两个层面上阅读。从某种意义上说，它们有两个视野，两个指向。它们指向诗篇作者直接的历史背景，但它们也有一个终极的指向——指向一位比大卫更大的大卫，一位比这位王更大的王，一位更大的勇士，一位更大的受苦仆人，等等。

现在这篇特定的诗篇是一首登基诗篇。如果你仔细阅读，你会发现它实际上由几个诗节组成，它与某人登上以色列王位有关。它显然可以从那个层面来阅读。你看，大卫家族中的某人，这可能最初是大卫，也可能最初是在大卫加冕时写的，但它肯定也在其他情况下使用，当大卫的后裔被立为王时。在开始时，它谈到地上的列国图谋反对这位王。好吧，如果你在那个时代成为一位王，你会有很多敌对的邻国，他们迫不及待地想试探你到底是什么样的王，你到底是什么样的将军，这是同一回事。因此，诗篇的背景是神被看作在以色列、在锡安立王，锡安是其中一座山。

锡安是耶路撒冷最初的山，在以色列人建城之前，耶布斯人在耶路撒冷建了一座城。所以锡安只是另一种谈论整个耶路撒冷城的方式。所以在这里，在耶路撒冷，王已经被立，但所有外邦敌对的王都在图谋反对这位王。所以诗篇作者说，当心。神与他同在。神会照顾他。神会给我们帮助。这就是你可以在一个层面上阅读这篇诗篇的方式。但如果你仔细阅读，你会发现没有任何地上的王能完全配得上这些威胁的愤怒。也没有任何地上的王能完全配得上这些应许的荣耀，你可以说诗篇第二篇的语言溢出了它的河岸。

如果诗篇第二篇是一条河，语言漫过了它的堤岸。关于这位王、这位受膏者所说的话太伟大了，真的无法局限于任何地上的王。事实上，在第2节，那里说，世上的君王一齐起来，敌挡耶和华并他的受膏者，在希伯来语中。你知道受膏者这个词是什么吗？弥赛亚（Mishayak）。

世上的君王起来，他们图谋反对耶和华和他的弥赛亚。顺便说一下，现在你走进任何地铁车厢，都有这张鲁巴维奇拉比、施尼尔森拉比的大图，上面写着什么？弥赛亚要来了。你最近坐过地铁吗？如果你非常非常富有或非常穷，你可能从来不坐地铁。但对于我们其他人，它就在那里。弥赛亚要来了。受膏者要来了。他说，准备好。这是非常好的建议。

现在看，这就是它所谈论的。耶和华已经立了他的弥赛亚，并立他为弥赛亚。因此，我们可以把这篇诗篇理解为谈论那位更大的大卫，那位更大的王。它实际上告诉我们三件事。让我把这些原则列出来，我们来逐一查看。

从第4节到第9节的中间部分告诉我们，我们有一位真正的王，一位高于所有王的王，一位在所有王背后的王。我们有一位真正的王，由神所立，他说是我的王。然后第1到3节告诉我们，然而，人类憎恨这位王。我们有一位真正的王，但我们憎恨这位真正的王。第10、11和12节非常实际。它们是对我们的召唤，让我们看到虽然我们有一位王，我们憎恨这位王，但我们需要这位王。没有这位王，我们永远找不到祝福。我们必须服侍，我们必须欢喜，我们必须亲吻这位王。所以这就是三点。我们有一位王，我们憎恨这位王，我们需要这位王。

好，让我们开始。第一点，我们有一位王。神说，这里有所有这些王，但有一位高于众王的王。在所有王背后有一位王。有我的王，我所立的真正的王。人类文学中一个非常有趣的事情是，我们所有文化中有多少古老的传说是这样的。有一位伟大的王，他以智慧、能力、公义和怜悯统治。因此，当这位王在的时候，这片土地经历了黄金时代，每个人都兴旺。我们都达到了我们的潜力，土地兴旺，艺术兴旺，关系兴旺，文明兴旺，但有些东西把这位王带走了，一切都恶化了。

一切都陷入衰败，但我们期待这位王回来的那一天。你知道我们有多少传说是这样的吗？这很特别。你有罗宾汉的传说，罗宾汉在战斗，因为好王已经离去，黑暗已经笼罩这片土地，他在战斗，只是为了保持火焰不灭，直到好王能够回来。你有伟大的亚瑟王故事，亚瑟王，卡梅洛特。当亚瑟统治时，有卡梅洛特，但现在他走了。据说他的墓碑上写着，这里躺着亚瑟，曾经的王，未来的王，不只是曾经的，而是未来的王。看，这是所有传说背后的关键。有一位伟大的王，当他在这里时，一切都很美好，他走了，他什么时候会回来？

当你甚至看到20世纪最成功和最有力量的现代传说之一，由托尔金写的《指环王》中的所有传说，实际上在所有这些传说背后，任何读过它们的人都知道，在很多方面，基本主题是有一位真正的王，他隐藏在北方，但他会出现。当他出现时，一切都会兴旺，对吗？王的手是医治的手，因此真正的王将被人所知。如此等等。

现在为什么，为什么有所有这些传说，而人类国王的实际记录是绝对糟糕的？人类国王的实际记录只是暴政、悲剧和奴役的记录，以至于几乎每一个君主制都被推翻，取而代之的是某种民主。因此，你知道，基督徒和顺便说一下，下午四点礼拜的一个好处是你可以问更多问题，之后我们有问答时间，基督徒在历史上一直是试图推翻暴君和国王并建立民主的一部分。

但问题是，尽管如此，为什么对国王有这种迷恋？为什么古老的传说对我们有如此强大的影响？不仅如此，为什么它们仍然对我们有强大的影响？为什么在仍然有某种王室存在的国家，有某种王室血统的国家，人们对王室着迷？为什么在像美国这样没有国王、没有王室血统的土地上，我们必须创造它们。

所以我们把亿万富翁、运动员、媒体明星甚至罪犯变成国王。我们给他们加冕，他们开庭，我们崇拜他们。为什么有相当一部分人不断地把自己交给充满活力、有魅力的人物，而这些人物却虐待他们？为什么有这种对国王的需要？为什么有这种给他们加冕的需要？为什么有这种创造他们的需要？为什么有这种崇拜他们的需要？

现在我不能深入探讨。这就是我说的，之后有人可能想问我这个问题。基督徒知道圣经知道民主是药，不是食物。我们不能靠药活着。它是药。我们必须有民主，因为人类太有罪，没有人真正适合统治。但我们需要一位王。我们是为一位王而被造的。

古老神话的原因，新神话的原因，所有超级英雄神话都是关于国王的新神话。我们崇拜国王并创造他们的原因是因为人类有一个记忆痕迹。你和我心中有一个记忆痕迹，关于一位伟大的王，一位古老的王，一位曾经以如此的能力、智慧、怜悯、公义和荣耀统治的王，以至于他的能力、智慧、怜悯和荣耀就像太阳全力照耀一样。我们知道我们是为了顺服那位王而被造的。我们是为了把自己交给那位王而被造的。我们是为了站在那位王面前、崇拜、服侍和认识那位王而被造的。这就是圣经所说的。圣经说有一位高于众王的王。有一位在众王背后的王。有一位在所有那些传说之下的王，即使最伟大的国王也只是我们心中记忆痕迹的模糊反映。

圣经说，如果你拒绝真正的王，你会找到一位王，因为你必须。即使你在理智上拒绝有真正的王这个想法，你也不能在本体论上拒绝它。你不能在你的存在中拒绝它。你不能在心理上拒绝它。你会找到某人来崇拜。你会找到救主。你会找到国王。你会崇拜某人。

我上个月读到的最令人心酸的事情之一。杰弗里·施马尔斯是《纽约时报》的一名作家，他患有艾滋病。他写了一年多关于这件事，他今年秋天去世了。就在两三周前，他们在周日的《纽约时报》杂志上发表了他最后的专栏，这是一个引人入胜的专栏，因为他写道，他很尴尬承认，但他公开承认了。他说，在上次总统选举之前，我很尴尬，我觉得如果我能让一个民主党人进入白宫，我就得救了。他说，我看着这位候选人，我说，这是我的白马王子。这些是他的话。这将是我的救主。他会把所有资源集中起来。他会找到治愈方法，几个月后他意识到自己是多么愚蠢，多么天真，他怎么能有那种感觉？事情真的没有那么简单。

好吧，这正是我们在这里讨论的。圣经说，你会找到一位王。你会找到一位白马王子。你会找到一位救主。你必须。它在你的血液里。它在记忆痕迹里。亚瑟王，罗宾汉，理查好王，白宫里的一位民主党人，或者某个你确信有一天会出现并让你心动的人，某个会拯救你的人，你需要一位王。如果你找不到真正的王，你会创造一个假的王，它会毒害你的生活。

亲爱的朋友们，你们的物质本性会得到满足。如果你否认你的物质本性的食物，它最终会吞噬毒药。它会吃任何东西。如果你否认你的属灵本性它所需要的王，它会吞噬某些东西。它会吞噬毒药，但它会吞噬。神说，我已经立我的王在锡安。我把全地赐给我的王。在希伯来书中，诗篇第二篇被引用。希伯来书说，你知道，对哪位地上的王或甚至天使，神真正会说，你是我的神和儿子。对哪位天使，或哪位地上的王，或甚至哪位天使，神会说，地极都是你的产业。希伯来书说，这只是宫廷夸张吗？这只是另一种，这只是你在地上君王加冕时必须堆积的奉承话，只是那种事情吗？还是神可能确实完全地对某人说了这话？

可能有一位真正高于众王的王，真正在众王背后的王吗？在新约中，福音的信息，基督教的信息是，是的，有。有一位。不只是一位，弥赛亚，弥赛亚快来了，基督，主所膏立的。这是第一点。有一位王，一位真正的王。

但第二，我们在第一到三节这里被教导，每个人类的天然内心都憎恨这位真正的王。所以你在第一、二、三节这里看到，为什么列国争闹，万民谋算虚妄的事？世上的君王一齐起来，臣宰一同商议，要敌挡耶和华和他的受膏者。他们说了什么。让我们挣开他们的捆绑，他们说，脱去他们的绳索。

现在这是我们印在那里的翻译，新国际版。好吧，它是什么意思？可能当你按照翻译的方式读它时，你得到的印象是耶和华和受膏者把地上的君王锁在锁链里，像囚犯一样被关在监狱里。那可能是一个糟糕的翻译。现在，当我研究这个时，我开始意识到，对于比我更了解希伯来语的人来说，那第二个词的问题应该被翻译为轭。地上的君王不是因为他们是囚犯而感到不安，他们身上有锁链。地上的君王感到不安是因为他们有一个主人。

轭是你放在牛身上的东西，或者马具是你放在马身上的东西。这里的意思是，有一个人拥有他们。有一个人要求他们被套上轭。有一个人要求因为他们被拥有，他们被创造，因此创造者对他们有权利。这就是他们不想要的。他们说，我想做我自己的主。

现在，这教导我们，第3节，这是每个人心中的基本冲动。我想是乔治·麦克唐纳，他是一位苏格兰作家，启发了C.S.刘易斯。乔治·麦克唐纳说，有一个信念，地狱的中心信念是，我属于我自己。现在我认为他的意思是，这是地狱里每个人都共有的一个信念。但同时，这也是创造地狱的那个信念。这个信念会在你的关系中创造地狱，在你的婚姻中创造地狱，在邻里中创造地狱，在社区中创造地狱，在你的生活中创造地狱。如果你按照这个原则运作，我属于我自己。把轭拿掉。我除了我自己不属于任何人，你看，我是我灵魂的主宰，我是我命运的主人。

这，乔治·麦克唐纳说，是每个人感受的本质。你从一开始就感受到它，如果你正在抚养任何孩子，你确切地知道，这是完全影响和支配每个人成长过程中的思想、感受、决定和世界观的东西。我属于我自己。把轭拿掉。因此圣经说我们憎恨有一位王的想法。我们憎恨有人对我们有权利的想法。我们憎恨一位在我们身上有轭的王说，你属于我。你不是你自己的，你必须照我说的做。

这就是为什么圣经说人类不仅仅是不相信神，我们恨他。乔纳森·爱德华兹就这个主题写了一整本书，书名是《人天生是神的敌人》。它基于像罗马书8章这样的经文，那里说，肉体的心思是与神为仇。你知道，确实有一次讲道，是19世纪英国的一次讲道，结尾是这样的，这些是最后的话，哦，我的朋友们，如果美德成为肉身出现在地上，我们会俯伏敬拜。那是相当愚蠢的，不是吗？因为你知道美德成为肉身确实出现在地上，我们做了什么？我们逃跑了，我们扼杀了他，我们隐藏了他，我们钉死了他，我们鞭打了他，我们杀死了他。为什么？把这轭从我脖子上拿开。我们都憎恨这位王。有一位真正的王，但我们恨他。

你可能知道浪子的故事，但它不仅仅是关于一个任性的弟弟。事实上，耶稣讲这个故事是对那些逃离神的人和那些试图通过做好人来赚取他的爱的人说的。在他的书《挥霍的神》中，Tim Keller展示了这个众所周知的故事如何揭示福音的核心，这是一个对叛逆的弟弟和自以为义的哥哥都有希望的信息，也是邀请所有人经历神挥霍、奢侈恩典的邀请。无论你是基督徒还是仍在探索信仰，《挥霍的神》都会帮助你以全新的方式看待你与基督的关系。《挥霍的神》是我们对你本月礼物的感谢，帮助福音与生命与全世界的人分享基督恩典和不懈的爱的希望和喜乐。

现在在我继续之前，我只需要回应人们总是提出的正常反对意见，他们提出，他们是可以理解的反对意见。人们说那是愚蠢的，那是真正的夸张。你知道，传道人喜欢把一切戏剧化，等等，当然有很多人对神漠不关心。有很多人不像他们应该那样顺服神，但普通人不是敌对的。普通人不恨神，不恨神，也不图谋反对他。哦，真的吗？让我给你几个。让我回答两个基本的反对意见。

有人说大多数人真的相信神。迈克尔·金斯利在《新共和》杂志上写了一篇有趣的社论。他一直听到很多人说美国对宗教越来越敌视。所以他写了一篇有趣的文章说，他说那真的是胡说八道。他说，我知道像华盛顿特区和曼哈顿这样的一些地方，有很多人不相信神，但超过95%的美国人相信神，他说在这个国家，在公共场合说我不相信神容易，还是在公共场合说我相信神容易。当然这取决于你是在曼哈顿还是在皮奥里亚。我敢肯定，但他的观点是，嘿，相信神是流行的。大多数人相信神，人们对神不敌对，人们对宗教不敌对。这是一个非常宗教的国家。他错了。

因为实际上他定义错了。圣经没有说人们敌视神的概念或神的想法。不，不，不。但圣经说人们恨圣经中的神。你看，圣经中的神是从西奈山发出雷声说，你们要圣洁，因为我是圣洁的。在我面前不可有别的神。是那位发出雷声说我必不以有罪的为无罪的神，或者是圣经中的神给我们弥赛亚，弥赛亚出现了，弥赛亚说什么？他说，你若不恨你的父母，就不能做我的门徒。你知道那是什么意思吗？他说，你必须爱我到这种程度，以至于你对任何其他人的任何感情与之相比都像是恨。这就是你必须爱我的程度。我必须在你的生命中是至高的。我必须在你的生命中是第一位的。我必须完全掌控你存在的每一个层面。神说，那是把轭放在你身上并说我拥有你的圣经的神。我是你的创造者。你属于我。那是圣经说人们恨的那种神。

当然有些人在这里，当我这样说话时，你们感到不舒服。你知道，你的背开始挺起来。你说，哦天哪，多么原始的观点，我证明了我的观点。这是一个人对圣经中的神的描述、表达、启示的正常反应方式，不只是一般的神。你知道，如果我开始这样说话，你相信圣经中的神吗？那位从西奈山发出雷声说你们要圣洁如同我是圣洁的神，他必不以有罪的为无罪。普通人会说什么？那些说他们相信神的95%的人会说什么？你知道他们说什么吗？他们说，好吧，我相信一位爱的神。我证明了我的观点。

圣经说我们恨那位是王的神。我们恨那位说你是我的产业的神。地极都是我的产业。看，第八节，我拥有你。这就是轭。那是我们拒绝的神。

小心，你可能会犯的另一个错误。有人说，哦，好吧，所以恨这位王的人是怀疑论者或拒绝宗教或拒绝基督教的人，不一定。别忘了这个。弗兰纳里·奥康纳的一个故事中有一个很棒的地方，她说，他心中有一个深深的、黑暗的、无言的信念，躲避耶稣的方法是躲避罪。我从未忘记那句话。多么伟大的一句话。多么深刻的洞察。

现在，我以前用过它，但让我展示我如何在这里应用它。她说，这里有一个非常虔诚的人。他认为躲避耶稣的方法是尽可能地做好人和道德高尚。为什么？你看，很多人用宗教来躲避耶稣。他们用宗教来躲避这位王。让我这样对你说。你相信你是一个相当体面的人吗？你相信你比大多数人好吗？你相信你是一个相当正直的人，你有道德标准并且坚持它们吗？你觉得如果神现在出现，他要决定接受谁进入他的天堂，你会觉得你有和任何人一样好的机会吗？

还是你相信你是一个如此无助的罪人，除了耶稣为你死之外，你绝对没有希望被神接受，除了神在耶稣基督里显示的怜悯之外你没有希望？你认为你是一个无助的罪人还是你认为？坦白说，你是一个相当有道德的人，朋友们。你难道没有看到吗？你在用道德。如果是前者，你在用道德来躲避耶稣。你避免真正依赖他，避免真正顺服他。我告诉你这个，无论是通过道德和宗教，还是通过怀疑和放纵的生活，人们恨这位王，他们通过试图躲避这位王来表达这种仇恨，他们否认和压抑他们自己的愤怒。

所以这里是，我们必须继续前进，但这里是关于这一点的总结。你怎么知道你是基督徒，你怎么知道圣灵在你的生命中这样工作？你知道你恨神吗？你看到了你的仇恨吗？你看到了你生命中对神的敌意吗？你看到了你多么恨这个轭吗？当你听到希律王在《耶稣基督超级巨星》中说，出去，你这个王，离开我的生活。你知道那是你自己心中的话吗？如果你知道你恨神，如果你知道那是你心中很大一部分，那证明你是基督徒，因为只有基督徒知道那个。只有基督徒能承认那个。只有圣灵能让你把那些被压抑的创伤材料浮出水面。如果你今天不承认你是神的敌人，你真的是神的敌人。成为他的朋友的唯一方法是承认你是他的敌人。知道神的圣灵在你生命中工作的唯一方法是如果你能够看到那种怨恨。我们有一位王，我们恨这位王，最后，第三，我们需要这位王。

第10、11和12节说，看，如果你看到你有这位王，你也看到你恨这位王，你唯一的办法是被说服，我会解释，被说服你需要这位王。服侍这位王，亲吻这位王，在这位王里欢喜。但你看，第10、11和12节说什么，没有中间地带。你可以服侍、欢喜、亲吻这位王，你会在他里面找到避难所并蒙祝福。或者你不服侍，你不欢喜，你不亲吻这位王，你就会灭亡。你会在你的道路上被毁灭。你站的地方是一个极大的宣告。这句话是，没有从这位王那里逃避的避难所。只有在这位王里面的避难所。看，没有中间地带。没有从这位王那里逃避的避难所，只有在这位王里面的避难所。你需要这位王。你必须被说服，让我这样对你说。

第10、11和12节的原则是，轭最终成为避难所，束缚最终成为宽阔，服侍最终成为自由，如果你把轭从你背上拿掉，因为你认为它是捆绑和奴役，你会发现你会灭亡。你需要那个轭。事实上，轭是让你进入自由的唯一方式。

所以，你知道，也许一个完美的例子，让我们假设这里有一个年轻女士，她想成为一个伟大的音乐家。那么你怎么，也许是你或也许是她，也许如果你是她的父母或什么，你看到她身上这个伟大的艺术天赋，你想让那个艺术天赋实现，好吧，你怎么做？轭，她被套在她的钢琴上，每天几个小时。有些日子她想去，有些日子她不想去，有些日子她喜欢练习，有些日子她不想练习，但每天她都被套在钢琴上，被套在她的练习上，随着时间的推移，轭成为避难所。你看，随着时间的推移，她的艺术技能开始绽放，随着时间的推移，她开始能够以一种如果她没有经历例行公事的方式来表达自己，让我们面对它，练习的枯燥。轭成为避难所。轭成为祝福，让我告诉你，没有什么比一个孩子来找你说，爸爸，妈妈，你为什么不让我练习更悲惨的了？你为什么不让我学习？我的潜力被毁了，我的机会已经过去了。你为什么不让我？你对孩子唯一能说的就是这个，因为你知道，最终你不能强迫某人做那件事。轭总是最终必须被你接受。你必须把它承担起来。我不能，你说，让你练习。我不能让你学习。我不能向你展示轭是通往自由的道路。没有什么比那更悲惨的了。

好吧，看这个类比是如何运作的？圣经说，在每个人身上都有潜力，有潜力。有些东西。如果你来到这位王面前，你会在你不知道你有花蕾的地方绽放。你有只有当你来到轭下，在这位王的轭下才会实现的潜力。相信并顺服并爱一位王意味着你可以找到你自己。这意味着你不再掌管你的生命。但那是一样的。你被套上轭了。那就是它的样子。那就是来到一位王之下的意义。

圣经说，因为你需要一位王，你在心理上无法理解自己，你在文化上无法理解自己。除非你看到你被这种对王的需要所驱动，否则你无法理解自己。你在试图回到卡梅洛特。你没有其他选择。因此，除非你顺服于你被造的目的，否则你会在道路上灭亡。你看到了吗？除非你顺服这位王，除非你完全彻底地把自己交给他？你的心，圣经说，就像一个八缸发动机只用一个缸在运转。你试过那样吗？它喷着、咳嗽着、摇晃着、停顿着，很糟糕，你难道没有看到吗？你两个最深的需要。你需要感到你很重要，你正在完成一些事情，你需要感到你被爱，你对某人有价值。当你服侍这位王，当你亲吻这位王时，这两个需要，只有那时这两个需要才会被满足，因为当你服侍他时，他服侍你，当你亲吻他时，他亲吻你。这就是关系中的方式。然后，哦，凡投靠他的都是有福的。

现在让我通过给你几个相当实际的例子来总结。圣经在第10、11和12节这里给了我们顺服这位王真正意味着什么的例子。让我给你三个。实际上让我给你四个，之后我会简短地讲，如果人们想让我展开，你可以在问答时间之后展开它们。你如何把耶稣当作王？你们很多人以一般的方式相信耶稣。你们很多人甚至求耶稣帮助你们的生活，但你们没有把他当作王。这就是为什么你们在生活中没有看到祝福。你们没有把他当作王。如果你想把他当作王，你必须做四件事。顺服，降服，依靠和期待。顺服，降服，依靠和期待。

看。顺服。也许那太简单了。也许我不应该花太多时间在上面，但等等。顺服。你们有些人认为你们在顺服，但你们没有。如果你说，好，这里是规则。看看这位王说的所有事情。总是原谅，总是。总是说真话，总是。总是回报，永远不要以恶报恶，而是总是以善报恶。使用性作为承诺，一个永久排他性婚姻契约的盟约更新仪式。不要嫉妒。不要苦毒等等。现在它们在那里。看，这个房间里没有人，我们中没有一个人会在遵守这些方面是完美的。但有一个人真正以耶稣为王与另一个只把耶稣当作顾问的人是有区别的。

你看，一方面，当我来找某人，你们有些人现在很苦毒，你们有些人对人生气，你们不愿意放手。你在播放录像带。你不原谅。你知道你应该，但你不愿意。你会在道路上灭亡。你在试图把轭从你身上拿掉。你难道没有看到吗？他的轭是轻省的。他的担子是轻省的。如果你原谅，如果你顺服并原谅，它会医治你，因为有区别。我有时可以去找人说，我看出你没有原谅。是的，他们说。你打算怎么办？一个基督徒总是说，我需要帮助。我知道这是错的。我拒绝。我没有这样做。我必须这样做。我该怎么办？但还有另一种人说，是的，我知道这是错的，但这个人应得的。不要告诉我如何过我的生活。

如果你说，我会顺服，如果感觉好的话，我会顺服，如果实用的话，我会顺服，如果流行的话，我会顺服，如果务实的话。你根本就没有顺服。耶稣不是在你生命中作为王。耶稣在你生命中作为顾问。他在给你建议，你在决定和谁睡觉，你在决定什么时候原谅，你在决定你要做什么和不做什么。他只是一个顾问。他不会那样来。你怎么敢那样对待他。看看他是谁。你必须顺服。把他当作王。你必须顺服他。你必须说，不是我的意愿，而是你的意愿得以成就。

第二，把他当作王，你必须接受。降服于他安排你生活的方式。这更难。这就是为什么我简短地提到它。有些人在他实际说的话上非常顺服，但当神让事情进入你的生活，你只是觉得，这不对，这不公平。看看他如何让我生活的环境发展。那时你不会把他当作王。你知道把他当作王意味着什么吗？说，你一定知道什么是最好的。哦，这并不意味着你只是在脸上挂着开朗的微笑说，我只是赞美耶稣。一切都很好。我相信他知道什么是最好的，从那个意义上说。你必须摔跤，你必须挣扎。但你知道，你必须像约伯一样。约伯记23章有一个伟大的地方。在他所有的摔跤中他有一个更好的时候，他说，我感觉不到神的同在。但神允许发生的事情让我充满恐惧。但引用，他知道我的道路，当他试炼我之后，我必如精金显出。他知道我的道路，当他试炼我之后，我必如精金显出。

你知道他在那里做什么吗？他在接受耶稣在他生命中的王权，他在说，我不明白发生了什么，它让我恐惧，我摔跤，但我知道如果我顺服地回应，如果我接受他给我的，如果我在这个大火炉中间忠心，我必如精金显出。我会更谦卑。我会更敏感。我会更有爱心。我会更有同情心。他降服于他的环境是净化的事实。你是这样给耶稣王权的吗？

好。第一，顺服之后。第二，你必须降服，接受环境。第三，你必须依靠他，当他说，亲子。你知道那意味着什么吗？如果你把任何东西加在耶稣上作为快乐的要求，如果你把任何东西加在耶稣上作为快乐的要求，那就是你真正的王。你看，如果你说，只要我生活中的这些事情顺利，我很乐意成为基督徒，很多时候，你来到基督教是因为你生活中某个领域出了问题，对你真正重要的事情，你真正的王的事情。你来找耶稣说，我要为你做这个和这个，但你能给我那个吗？如果你的生活在那个方向不顺利，如果那些事情没有发生在你身上，你准备把整个事情推翻说，我白白保持我的手纯净。我白白洗净我的手和心，保持无辜。

亲吻这位王意味着什么？意味着顺服他、降服于他，因为你被他的美丽所倾倒。意味着说没有什么我爱的超过我的王。意味着我不会把我的王当作达到目的的手段，但王的爱本身就足够了。最后，顺服，降服，依靠，还有一件事，期待，战兢而欢喜。那是什么意思？我相信如果你对耶稣在你生命中能做的太悲观，你就没有把他当作王。你必须有配得上一位王的期待。你有一位王进入你的生命。你知道约翰·牛顿说过一个地方，来到一位王面前，带着大的祈求，因为他的恩典和能力是如此，没有人能要求太多。

你把他当作王还是你看着你生命中的问题说，那里永远不会发生任何事情？那总是会是这样。事情总是会那样。来到一位王面前，带着大的祈求，因为他的恩典和能力是如此，没有人能要求太多。如果你对我在你生命中能做的和我通过你能做的事情悲观，你看到了什么，你就没有把他当作王。你能服侍他吗？你能顺服他吗？你能亲吻他吗？你能战兢而欢喜吗？没有从他那里逃避的避难所，但在他里面有极大的避难所。凡投靠这位王的都是有福的。

让我们祷告。父啊，我们现在祈求，当我们思考这些事情时，因为这是你的话语，愿你的灵来开启我们的心，让我们看到我们应该如何应用这些事情，我祈求这里的每个人都能发现，当他们来亲吻这位王并出于对他的爱而顺服时，他们会发现他们的生命正在敞开。求你赦免我们想要把轭拿掉。让我们看到轭成为避难所，束缚成为宽阔，服侍，你的服侍是我们完美的自由。我们奉耶稣的名祷告，阿门。
