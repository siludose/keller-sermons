Yeah, I was actually a real-life formal teacher for five years at Graduate School Seminary  actually lectured and I created tests and I graded tests and papers for five years. I said, get me back in the ministry where you can teach and teach you nobody knows whether  the people are learning or not. It's wonderful.

There's no way to find out. It seems like so, took all the pressure off. Let me, let, yes, okay. Let me suggest, the only book that CS Lewis ever wrote on public education, that's what this  book's supposedly about, the abolition of man, little booksy, short books, the sort of thing  that everybody wants. Let me share two thoughts from the book.

If you are a teacher and have never read it, or if you haven't read it in a long time,  I suggest you read it because it is about education. The first essay is called Men Without Chests, very famous and in it, he takes a book that  was written at the time, I guess, in the 1940s, a book that was supposedly a textbook for  English literature for high school students, what we call high school. And in the book, there's this great quote here, that Lewis quotes. He says, the textbook says, when people say a waterfall is sublime, they think they are  saying something very important about the waterfall, but they are only saying something about  their feelings about the waterfall. And Lewis pointed out that this is the very essence of modern, this is the essence of  modernity.

This is the essence of modern Western culture. What they were saying is, if you talk about an objective fact, something that can be  proven, something that's empirically investigatable, that's a fact. But if you say anything that can't be proven empirically, if you say adultery is a sin,  or I believe in God, or a waterfall is sublime, you're just talking about feelings. It's subjective. It's not really important, David said.

And Lewis points out, this is the essence, and this is if you're a public school teacher,  this is the essence of your problem. That you're allowed to talk about, supposedly, you're allowed to talk about anything that's  subjective, empirically proven, something that can be rationally investigated. But when it comes to moral values, religious beliefs, I believe in God, I think adultery  is wrong. Whenever you get into anything that can't be proven, that's subjective. That's supposed to be kept private.

You're not allowed to talk about that. It's of course a big hot issue, but in politics, am I allowed to bring my moral views into  the public realm? Some people say, no, of course not. You don't bring your religious or moral views into the public, into politics. There we only talk about what's reasonable and rational, not what you think is your moral  values.

Lewis responds by saying, if you really believe that everything is relative, and it comes  to morality, he has this very famous place where he says, he says, if you're actually  educating students in this way, if you're actually educating students to believe,  that things that are objective, fact, are one thing. But all moral views, all views about morality, religion, or anything like that is completely  subjective, completely to be kept private. Completely relative, that is, to your individual consciousness or to the culture you're  in. He says, you realize what's going to happen, and this is the quote that ends that essay. He says, you can hardly open a periodical without coming across a statement that our civilization  needs drive or more self-sacrifice.

In a sort of ghastly simplicity, we remove the organ and demand the function. We make men without chests and expect to them virtue and enterprise. We laugh at honor and our shock to find traders in our midst. We castrate and bid the gildings be fruitful. And what he's really saying is, if you really say everything is relative, except that which  is empirically proven, self-sacrifice, why be self-sacrificial?

Why care about the common good? Why be a good citizen? Why? He says, you can't educate people like that. So what's the answer?

He actually brings out something called the Dow. And what he means by the Dow, T-A-O, taken by way from the Chinese idea that there is a  kind of, it's natural law. He says he believes that, and most all religions believe, that the religions actually differ on  many things like how you're saved. All human beings have some basic understanding of God and some basic understanding of right  and wrong that we kind of know intuitively. And Lewis makes a case that on the basis of that, what Catholics would call natural law  and what Protestants would call common grace.

On the basis of the fact that people know some things intuitively, you can educate and  you can appeal on the basis of this understanding that there's such a thing as common grace. Now, what do I mean by that? It's actually very important for both people who are in Christian schools or private schools  as well as public schools. And I'm here, by the way, I'm giving you a more Protestant view of natural, long common  grace. The Protestant view is if you have a thin understanding of sin that is just breaking  certain rules, you should make that more robust, a thick understanding of sin according  to the Bible, a thick, robust view of sin, is that sin is making anything more central  than God.

Sin is idolatry. So nationalism and making your family or making your moral record or making doctrinal  purity, the thing that makes us better than everybody else. Those are all forms of idolatry and self-righteousness, but of course materialism, sex, power, aggressive  violence. They're all idols. And so a robust understanding of sin is not just your breaking rules because as you know,  the Pharisees were horrible sinners because they were terribly self-righteous and filled  with pride and were terrible people, even though they were being all the rules.

Secondly, if you want to understand natural law and common grace, you have to have a thick  understanding of grace. And here's what I mean by a thick understanding of grace. You need to understand that in Romans chapter 1, verse 18 to 25, we read this. I can find it. It says yes.

Romans 1, 25 says, since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities have been clearly  seen being understood from what has been made, so men are without excuse. Now what's that saying is all human beings basically know the golden rule, basically  know we must not be selfish, basically know we should care for our families, basically  know a right and wrong, but they repress it. But what's interesting is the verbs are being understood, are being seen, are present  passive participles. And what that means is that at any given time, every human being on the face of the earth  is experiencing, in their innermost being, a dialogue between what they know about God  and what they know about right and wrong and their own idolatrous hearts. So every cultural product, every poem, every work of art, every essay, every op-ed piece,  everything that is ever produced has, is a result of that dialogue, which means that  if you're, if I'm a Christian and I'm producing a cultural product, which is a sermon by  the way, that there's idolatry in it, there's something wrong with it, there's idolatrous  discourse in it.

I'm in some way, I'm never quite hitting it just right, I might have pride in my own  perspiterianism, I might have just a lack of humility in the way in which I speak. I mean, in other words, there's both truth in what I'm saying and idolatry. But in non-Christians, according to Romans 1, people who even overtly say they're not,  they don't believe in God, when they produce movies, when they produce films and they produce  art, when they produce essays, there's always some witness to God's truth in there. It shows there's good things being stated by non-Christians all the time because of common  grace. And C.S.S.L.S. says, you have to understand common grace, you have to have a robust view  of sin and a robust view of grace if you're going to educate, and here's the reason why.

If this is the case, this is one of the reasons why when I get asked this question, it's  hard for me to believe that Christian education, Christian schools, or public education, Christians  and public schools is, it's hard for me to believe that either one of those is the only  way to go. It's hard for me to believe that's the only way to educate people. It seems to me that if you're in a Christian school, I did have, as you're going to hear  in a minute, I've had my children everywhere, which shows a lack of discipline or a lack  of cohere in philosophy or maybe I have some other reasons, but it's not hard for me  to see that when I put my kids in Christian schools very often they come out with some ways  in which they're learning the Bible. You can see idolatrous discourse, you can see rigidity, I've never forgotten my first  grade son comes home from his Christian school in Hope, Virginia, and he says, we were praying  for the children in public schools today, why? Because they can't pray and their faith is being assaulted all the time, it's first  greater.

While there's some idolatrous discourse in that, okay, that's all. On the other hand, in the public school, here you're going to be having to educate not  by quoting the Bible if you're Christian, but by appealing to natural, uncommon grace. You have to expect that, first of all, people who aren't believers or who are believers  and other religions are going to have some understanding of the truth, you know, just  to give you a real example, obvious example, rape. Almost everybody thinks rape is wrong, why? Can you prove it scientifically?

Absolutely not. Is it rational, well, it's practical, but there's no rational or empirical way to prove  that rape is wrong. Why don't we all think rape is wrong? Why is it enshrined in our legislation? And why can we say, in a public school room, that rape is wrong?

Do you realize that's a value? That is a faith bleep. That is something we believe is wrong, but we could never prove, but common grace and  natural relation, no matter almost who we are, we all intuitively know it. Now what you have to do is you have to find those other places, you have to reason on  the basis of natural, uncommon grace, and lastly, just to code here, one of the things  that's important to realize is increasingly, though I need some of you are going to say,  I don't see it, okay, but I see it. Increasingly it's going to be harder and harder for public schools or in fact for our public  institutions to keep maintaining this difference between fact and value.

More and more people are recognizing that everything you say is based on faith assumptions,  like I just gave you the example of rape. When someone says, we all know rape is wrong, why do we know rape is wrong? That's an act of faith. That's a moral judgment. And when someone says, you can't bring your moral judgments into the classroom, you have  to realize everybody's doing that.

Everybody is saying, on the basis of my understanding of the nature of reality, on the basis of my  understanding of the story that I think we're all in, there's an individualistic enlightenment  story that says there's really no truth except human rights and we also be free to decide  what is right around for us, but that's a story. That's a way of understanding all of reality, it's a world view, it's a faith thing, you  can't prove that. And if you're a Christian teacher, whether you're in private schools at our Christian or  your public schools at our Christian or your Christian schools, it's going to be increasingly  important and possible to show your students that everything that every statement practically  comes embedded in a moral view of the world view, and you have to identify it as such. So you know, you say Martin Luther King Jr. worked for civil rights because why did he  do it? Did he say, everything is relative and every individual has to decide what is right  of frame or hurt?

He said, because the Bible says so, he did do that, he said, let justice roll down. He was an African-American Protestant, and within his understanding, the reason, as you  know, I guess the reason that black activists went into civil disobedience as opposed to  what their white liberal friends said in the 1950s, was their white liberal friends were  humanists who didn't believe the human beings were sinful. But the black activists who were reading Reinhold Niebuhr and the Bible, they did know that  human beings were sinful, and they were never going to, that the Americans, white Americans  would not give up power unless they were pushed, and that they wanted to do it in a way that  was still Christian and loving, so they did civil disobedience, peaceful civil disobedience. You have to show that what Martin Luther King Jr. did came out of a particular understanding  of human nature and of God and of right and wrong, because everybody who says anything, even  people who believe in human rights, that comes out of an enlightenment view of what life  is like. Increasingly, you're going to be able, you're going to have to tell people these stories and  let your students recognize how every moral claim, every claim of any sort is embedded in  a worldview.

You have to be able to say that, increasingly, the people at the top, the philosophers know  there's no such thing as reason that is just unembedded in a particular understanding  of ultimate reality, and increasingly, you're going to be able to do it too. So on the basis of common grace, on the basis of this understanding of things, I actually  think that it means those of us in Christian education, like me, have to recognize the limited  nature of our Christian education. Those of you who are Christians in public education have to realize, I think, real possibilities  for instructing people in wisdom, and maybe increasing possibilities in talking openly  about various faith views. So now, I've saying that because my guess is that when I get these questions now, I'm  going to tend to refer to this basic insight that comes from the abolition of men. Okay?

So I'm supposed to lead for the next 45 minutes. Well, I'm supposed to take questions and I think what this means is panel. You're supposed to shoot me questions about, first of all, what kind of school, private,  public, Christian, home schooling, isn't that right, Catherine? Let's try, let's shoot me questions about that for a while, and I'll try to make answers,  and you can maybe respond, and then I'll start to. I think when we talk about choices and philosophy, what really comes down to is how we live  all lives and where we place our children and where we choose to live.

So I know from a long term relationship with you, actually, your youngest son went  to a Bronx science and he had a math tutor who was a teacher to Christian school that I  was running at the time. Right, my oldest son went to public school all the way through. All the way through. New York public schools. New York public schools.

But I know for sure that you sent your other children right to Christian boarding schools. And my question that I had for you was how you've gone to that process, why, what the  difference was in the choices, why you made those choices, and going back on reflection,  how would your advice parents today to live their lives with their children? Okay, there's two questions. First would be, why did I do what I did? My three sons, we've been here almost 16 years, well, over into our 16th year, our oldest  son went through public school all the way.

Our other two sons went to public school, Michael, my middle son went to public school until  ninth grade and I sent him to Stony Brook, which is a Christian boarding school without  one and a half away. And my youngest son, Jonathan, went, I think, till fourth grade to public school, from  fifth grade to eighth grade, went to a Catholic school, so I'm really diverse, by the way. And then went, and then he went to Stony Brook, the Christian boarding school as well. Number one, I really mean it. My wife, I talked about, make sure my wife and I were still in agreement on this before  I came.

Is that we really do see advantages to the various forms of education. We do not, and I would be disappointed if Christians didn't vigorously go into every  one of these kinds of education, private, Christian, private, and public. I think we can do a huge amount of good and renewal in each one of them. And that's why, because I had no philosophical problems with any one of them, we were free  to choose the one that we thought fit the kid. We didn't have a problem with Christian education or problem with public education, therefore  we were able to make a choice.

If he had gotten into towns and Harris, we might have kept him here. He tried to get into towns and Harris, but in hindsight, we really made the right choice  because he would have been living at home and that wasn't the best thing for him. Jonathan just insisted he wouldn't want to go to Stony Brook, too. And when we looked back on it, we're still not sure it was the best idea, but it was  also... we thought it was okay, and so he did it because he really, really wanted. And this is, by the way, those of you who are parents as well as teachers know, this  is how you do this.

You do it on a case-by-case basis. Now, if we thought public school was no good, or Christian schools, no, no, no, none of that,  we would have not been able to have all those options, but we have. In fact, by the way, on top of that, my sister, my dear sister, I love to the sky, is the  best home schooler I know. She's home school. A lot of people believe it or not.

You say, well, not only all of her five children, but everybody else's children in the neighborhood,  I think. And it's been... so I've gone all around the block. What would we say today to... I would say the same thing, just to parents who are Christians  that you do have a number of options and that you really ought to do it on a case-by-case  basis, and I would actually hope that Christians would somehow be well-distributed. I do think we actually need to need more Christian schools in a city than we've got.

I also think we need Christians to be much more actively involved in the public schools  and renewal of the public schools. I would like all the thousands of flowers to bloom. I really think it's really possible. I think because a lot of us... it's hard... if you're into public schools as a teacher,  I hope you'll feel like this is the... there's nothing wrong with you feeling like your  approach is the superior one. If you don't feel a little...

I mean, I like to... there's this really odd tension. I want to feel... I want everybody on my staff to feel like there's no church-like redeemer. You know, you've got to feel like this is the greatest church. You have to be careful about that because it's more emotional than it is intellectual.

You stand back. You have to say no, wait a minute. There are a lot of other great churches. So you should feel the same way if you're into public... if you want to create great  Christian schools for the city and you define that and you really want to do that, that's  all right for you to feel like this is my passion, this is what I want to do. And to feel like...

I want to recruit as many people into that as possible, and vice versa  for public schools as well. So that's the reason why I... we have to do a case-by-case basis. Okay, other questions? I just want to give a little background. I'm not a product of Christian and public schools, so I think not only what fits the... what  fits the child, but different times in the child's life, so I think you know, that's  very important.

I also just want to kind of make a point about why I'm sitting here as an administrator,  as a direct result, Catherine mentioned that I'm in the Leadership Academy. The reason I'm in a Leadership Academy to make a very long story short is from a conversation  on a site visit that Chancellor Klein had to a school that I was working at in East Flatbush,  a failing school teacher there, and I couldn't wait till he got there to tell him everything  that was wrong and to talk about, how can you let children live in these conditions? So anyway, out of that conversation, and he said, well, how did you get the students  to read? Their older siblings can't even read. And so did you do this?

And did you do that? And was it where you went to graduate school? And was it that? And I said, actually, it's about creating a caring community for us. So every day in my classroom, I start with morning meetings and we talk about what it means  to treat each other the way we want to be treated.

And I went through this whole thing, expecting him to, you know, run away, because that  has nothing to do with the reform effort that they were moving in terms of the unified  curriculum. And actually, his response was he listened for about 30 minutes and he said, can you please  email all of that to me? And I thought, well, you know, that's just some kind of, you know, let me make her feel  good. She gave me all this garbage or whatever. But is the conversation went on?

He said, as a matter of fact, I really need you to apply for this program. And I said, which program? And he said, the leadership academy, and you know, nothing about it. And I said, oh, no, I want to be a teacher. I have no interest in administration.

And he said, I know, that's exactly why I need you there. So what I ended up emailing him was a policy memo, basically entitled transforming New York  City Schools with the Golden Rule. And no doubt about it, that's been the voice that I've brought to the leadership academy  and that I'm trying to bring to this school. So I just want to say that that is very true that there's so many opportunities. And we're in such a crisis in public education that I'll be honest with you.

They don't really care where you say it comes from as long as it works. So what goes hand in hand with that is the quality. You can't go around and say I'm a Christian, I'm a Christian, and yet you're doing substandard work  and too often that becomes a crutch. So I just want to re-emphasize that this is, you know, and for all of it, you know, not talking about politics. There is an open opportunity to impact the schools.

That's my context for the question that I agree with Tim. What I do have a problem with is that the loudest voices in Christianity today seem  to be people that are anti-public schools and anti-having Christian students and public schools. And I do believe that there's different settings for every child. But I just want to read a statement that kind of set off my whole concern. This is by Mr.

Rae Moore, who runs an organization called the Exodus Mandate  that are asking all Christians to remove their students from their children from public schools. The quote is, a movement to purge the public schools of Christian children  would literally electrify and invigorate the church as nothing has done in modern times. And might trigger the revival we are all awaiting so expectantly. So that, and that's actually has supportive Dr. James Dobson of Kennedy.

So this is what's circulating. And I'm, you know, maybe not here, but in other places in the country. So I guess my question is, and I have asked this also to an email kind of dialogue with Mr. Moore,  especially in a city like this in a crisis. We can all acknowledge the crisis situation.

What do we as Christians? What is our responsibility to students in the public schools? And what are the ways that we can work together to bridge this divide between homeschool,  private school, Christian school, as in church, you know, so I don't know if that's a question. No, it is. Let me, I'll say something.

I want to make sure Scott or somebody asked me a question about Christian school,  if you will, I mean, so I, so the other shoe drops. But let me just say something good about, well, no, here. Should we just plant new churches? Or should we renew the churches that exist in a city? Now, I've done a lot of thinking about that since I'm a church planter.

And it is fairly easy when you plant a new church to give the impression or maybe even believe  that all the other churches around here are dead and this just won't work. So we have to start a new church that's really on fire. Now, the fact is that a city will not be reached for Christ only by new churches. There's tons and tons of people that will go to the existing church and only to the existing  church. The older church, the church that, you know, their parents and their grandparents were at,  it's only going to read.

That's the only way that a whole lot of people are going to be reached by the existing  churches, the established churches, the older churches. It's also true that unless you start new churches, the older churches don't sometimes  get, get pricked into making changes. We really found it when Redeemer got started. We started doing a lot of stuff that the other churches and towns that would never work. It did work at Redeemer.

Next thing you know, they started doing it in the older churches. There actually is therefore a need for something like a Christian school movement and there's  no doubt that there's a lot of schools that are outside of the public school system that  can do things that the public school system can learn from. You've got to have renewal like that, but you also have to renew one of the public schools  too. You just can't abandon all the students in public schools. So I know the way to reach a city is to not only plant new churches, but to renew the  old churches.

It's not any other war at all. Over the years there have been church planters who are like this people in this petition  or this movement. They're really saying the existing church is just a whole lot of crap and it's going to  hell in the hand car. We're just forgetting about it and everybody should come out and join us because we're  the true new church. It never works.

It creates friction, sectarianism, so you just have to have both as simple as that. I think that would be the thing to say. I really do believe there's going to be an opening more and more for Christians who  are careful. Not being sectarian, understanding common grace and natural law. There's going to be a way for us to be able to talk in public settings about the faith  basis for what we're saying because what you have to say, everybody's got one.

So, when you come and say this, look, that's a faith, there's a faith basis to that. You have to explain everybody, so reason for this is out, let me just finish this one. Alistair Macinty wrote a book in 1984 called After Virtue. It's had a huge impact on the thought life, especially the philosophy world. He said you can never talk about something being good unless you ask, answer the question,  what is it for?

So, he may have heard me use this illustration. You can't say whether it's a good watch unless you ask, what is it for? It's lousy for pampering nails, by the way, if you've ever tried. But it's wonderful for telling time. So the question is, is it a good watch or not or is it a bad watch?

It all depends on what it's built for, what's it for? As soon as you start to say, is this a good person? Is this a good human being? You can't answer that question unless you ask, what are human beings for? What are they mean?

What is the meaning of human life? What are we here for? What is the important stuff? And you can't answer that question from science. You can't.

There's a Hindu answer, there's a Buddhist answer, there's an individualistic enlightenment  answer, there's a secular answer, there's a Christian answer, there's a Jew, anybody  who says anything about this is good behavior, this is bad behavior, is embedding it in a  particular worldview, a set of faith assumptions. There's no way that anybody can, if you say that well, in any public setting, nobody  knows how to gain sight anymore. Because the enlightenment idea of some kind of objective, neutral view from nowhere is  gone, everybody has been against understanding that. There's got to be a way for us as Christians, therefore, even in public education, to say,  here's the way the Christian thing works, here's the way the Jewish thing works, here's  the way the Hindu things work, and talk about it with our students. Christianity, whenever it's compared, always looks pretty good.

It's got a whole lot of great practitioners like Martin Luther King Jr., if you're allowed,  for example, to make him what he really was, which is a minister of the gospel. And there's, we have an awful lot of really great examples, you can, I find in some way,  if you're in a more vangelic church, where you're always working with non-Christians, you  always are so excited about it, but you wonder, I wish I was in a church where there wasn't  as much transience, and there was, the people were there from year to year, and I could  work on discipleship. In other words, I've been in churches where every, I had a church in Virginia, where nobody  ever left, and nobody ever came, and I had a lot of, I was able to do a lot of discipleship  and deep drill down theological education, but I, I had a passion for evangelism and reaching  out. And I think if you're in public education, or if you're in Christian education, you're going  to find, in general, that you get different things done. You're going to find one that enables you to kind of talk more, and reach out to people,  and yet you always feel like, my hands are somewhat tied, I can't completely go down where  I would like to go, and very often in Christian education sometimes you feel like it's kind  of a hot house.

So I just don't know the one is the ideal, and I think we've got to have both, and anybody  who gives the impression that everybody came out of public schools and wanted to Christian  schools, that would be wrong, however. Because I'm doing this thing on Proverbs this year, I now understand probably what the  goal of a school would be, would be wisdom, which is helping kids understand how life  works, how the human heart works, so that they know how to make right choices, even in  areas where the moral rules don't apply, that would be, and I think that what's interesting  is that could be something to both public school teachers, who are Christians, and Christian  school teachers could both be trying to do, they're going to go bad a little bit differently. Having said that, Scott, you want to ask your question? Actually, I do, thank you. Since the schools are not reading yet, and that they are still to my understanding hostile  to the faith, why should parents put their children in the hands of a school system that  is so hostile, especially in light of the fact that even if the child is growing up in  a Christian home, is aware of the gospel, perhaps, or the accepted Christ, their faith  is still being formed, that it's not yet resilient, they can't stand on their own.

Why would a parent turn their child over to such an institution when their opportunities  to unwind that indoctrination is still limited? I think that is, since I don't believe in neutrality and I don't believe there's such a thing,  as I just said, therefore I have a lot of sympathy for the idea of putting my kid in the Christian  school, my children who were in Christian school benefited from it, put it this way. I have found in New York that the real anti-Christian schools are private schools. In other words, Buckley and Chapin, not Bronx Science or Stivocent. I think to be fair to non-Christian schools, we need to make that distinction.

I've seen a huge difference, and now I found the public schools in the suburbs very often,  and they're thinking, you either have secular people or Christian people, these crazy  nutty Christians. Here in the city, the public school teachers are dealing with Hindus and Muslims and  Buddhists and Jews and Christians and Orthodox Christians and Catholic Christians, and I  found them incredibly careful and unbelievably respectful. For example, every year, and in Roosevelt Island Elementary School, I was asked to come  in along with a rabbi and along with a priest and we came in and we talked about the Holy  Days because the Jewish teacher that public school teacher taught all of my kids all went  through just said, look, I really want them to understand these different points of  view, and she says, I'm even trying to make sure I don't let them think that I believe  that they're all relative. Even though she was secular, but she said, I realize in a sense that she understood that  if I just said, well, there's this view in this view and isn't it wonderful? Everybody's got their own religion, they're all equally valid.

Even to say that is actually a totalitarian point of view. That's it. Even though she could never say that's an enlightenment view, she understood that in a way  that was putting secularism over the other religions. And I think to some degree, she's scared, she's scared of some angry Hindu or Muslim or Christian  parent coming in and screaming. And I guess in New York, everybody screams and so I found that public schools were extremely  respectful of the different religions and weren't that hostile.

And seemed to even have an intuitive understanding that even secularism couldn't be pushed down  the throat of these kids, or else their parents were going to take their teachers' heads  off. I want you to know that when it comes to some of the quote unquote elite private schools  in the city, where a lot of people want to send their kids, they're there's overtly  hostile. And I'm not kidding. And they delight in dismantling any kind of traditional understanding of authority or morality. And therefore I think you ought to make a distinction.

That's the first thing. Secondly though, I was kind of glad that my kids, I think the two that were both in public  school and Christian school probably benefited. I think that then if they had been in Christian school all the way or had been in public school  all the way, I saw some advantages of that. So I don't know what that tells you, I'm just a wishy watchy Charlie Brown guy. But I think you do have to watch very carefully because I think Scott's question is right.

If you're, I was talking to parents, I would say you really need to know how hostile  or what your school district or your local school is like or what your, what the teacher's  views are like because you really don't have the right to abandon me. The Bible, Deuteronomy 6 says, parents, you are responsible for your children's upbringing. And when I can't delegate that away, I mean I can delegate away the actual day in and  day out work of teaching to somebody else but I can't delegate away the responsibility. It's estimated that most of us spend half of our waking hours at work. How does the wisdom of the Bible apply to our careers?

In other words, how can our work connect with God's work and how can our vocations be more  emotional? In his book, every good endeavor, Tim Keller draws from decades of teaching on vocation  and calling to show you how to find true joy in your work as you serve God and others. The book offers surprising insights into how a Christian perspective on work can serve  as the foundation for a thriving career and a balanced personal life.

One of the things I've noticed in reading New York Times magazine recently, I'm sure  Tony being a journalist has noticed this, that increasingly when reporters are doing when  they're writing articles about hot topics, instead of acting like they're the all-knowing  objective omnipotent omnipresent narrator, they are making disclaimer of what where their  own position is. It was interesting this article on faith in the marketplace, it was in the cover story  of New York Times magazine last Sunday. The report did a great job and he came out and said in full disclosure disclaimer, here's  my view. This is my religious view. Nevertheless, I'm going to say this, I'm going to try to really be fair-minded and recognize  the advantages over here.

And I think that's increasingly possible. You have to, I know that there would be certain, you have to watch out with certain teachers  and certain other parents. So I would be very careful, but I bet you increasingly, if you say, well, this is where I'm coming  from, we're all coming from someplace and I just want in the interest of full disclosure  that you know that this is my viewpoint, but I really can appreciate yours. Now, I think that therefore is possible. I don't think even 10 years ago you could have done that, but I think increasingly people  are going to recognize that we're all embedded in moral communities, we're all embedded  in faith communities, that even the secular people is a kind of faith.

What's important is not do you make truth claims, but how do you treat people who have  different views? And I think that you have to say, it's not a question of whether I believe this or it's  how I treat the others, and I want to show that I really respect and I also want you  to help me understand your viewpoint and maybe this will change some of the ways in which  I see things. So I think you can be more open. But I'm afraid of, be careful, you know, don't say, oh Tim Keller said, and then you go  back and you next time you have a parent interview, you said, by the way, I'm a born again  Christian. But it needs to be relevant to the subject.

You don't just say, I want you to know, Tim, my pastor told me, I can do this, it needs  to be relevant to the subject, but if it is relevant to say something about it, it's  not bad. Somebody else. I do a lot of polling and religious issues during the campaign, and there was a sort  of a disinterest actually among certain esteemed journalistic organs here in the city until  about 7 o'clock on Tuesday evening, my mailbox was flooded with co-house. And all we had been, the sort of turned on a dying impologies, I'm sorry, we didn't publish  anything, you wrote, but now we will never think, but so you do get changes, but I do, the  one weakness is that if we're in such a position is that in graduate and undergraduate  education for teachers, we don't actually provide too many tools for believers to be able  to work out their faith in an intelligent way into their teaching and in their educational  philosophy. So put on your hat, you're asked to come to Teachers College at Columbia and to give  me some advice of changing the design so that you can enhance the educational experience  and of believers who are increasingly appearing at our gates.

You know, I think it's fair to be as suspicious as I think you are about motives here. My, you know Rick Lens, you know who he is, teach the Gordon Conwell, he told, I think  he's probably right about this, he says, because in secular society politics is everything,  because power is everything. Right now, suddenly everybody seems to think, oh, religion is important for getting elected. So we have, I think Catherine told me this just this week, says there's an awful lot  of people are suddenly going to say, we got to figure this out, we got it, we got to figure  this out, we got to understand this, this phenomenon, religion, and especially orthodox religion,  we got to figure it out, figure out what makes it tick, maybe learn how to dismantle it,  maybe weaken it or maybe use it somehow, figure out a way to, and you know, if somebody  comes and says, we want to do a story because we understand you're a Christian school teacher,  and we want to, we're doing a story on Christians who are in the public school, be careful  about all of that for a while, because I'm afraid I don't want to just be a specimen,  that people certainly, I guess maybe all, I guess we are anyway, but I would be careful  about, I'd be careful about what the motivation is, I want to use you to show us how to market  to evangelical Christians. So let's say they're serious and they say, you know, we're not really, you know, a lot  of our students complain or say that they don't really get, really intellectually developed,  because they're inside of them is never done, so what would you suggest?

Yeah, I think I probably would, there's a new book by, you know, what I do, there's a new  book by Nicholas Woolworth's store called Educating for Shalom, even though it's mainly  about, he's taught a Yale for years, he just retired, strong Christian guy, Dutch Calvinist  kind of Kaipirian theologian, and he's written, it's actually a bunch of essays on, it's  mainly Christian education, but he would say for example, Tony, there's the old myth  of the universal that I'm just the human being, you know, I'm not coming from any particular  perspective, I'm just telling you the facts, he says there's a, there's a solid, cystic  kind of particularism where it just says, I have the truth and you don't, I have the Bible  and you're, you're the only, and then he calls what he calls accessible particularism,  which is to say, let's all get out, let's get out on the table, the fact that I, what  we're saying is embedded in various faith narratives and let's talk about it and let's  try to learn from one another and let me, let me, let me, therefore let me actually  give you my Christian approach to economics, brothers and sisters, have you got questions  on the education reform? I'd say question for everybody else, but here, would you like to encourage everyone,  the space that's being created, if anyone has read Thomas Urgeo-Vani, I urge you to look  him up, because the interesting, the tension that's going on in the system as well, there's  this instruction, instruction, instruction, focus, Thomas Urgeo-Vani is one of the most revered  people in the field of education and the board of education pays him to come here, so when  he comes to talk, I was sitting next to an orthodox Jewish colleague of mine and we listened  to his entire speech, which was all of the top brass of the DOE and it was so funny that  everything he outlined was completely about faith-based communities, but talking about  how this is really the way schools as organizations should be, so, but every, oh, that's wonderful. He knows just enough scriptures to put in, actually, in his writing, he does reference  scripture, and so I'm just, I guess I'm curious because with school reform, what's  happening and a lot of the criticism of the academy and things that the chancellor is  doing is that they're trying to take business strategies and just dump it on top of education,  so I guess, and Sergei Ivani was making the claim that schools are more akin to churches  and social organizations, so I guess my question is, what are some of the elements of church  life and other social organizations that we can use to help perform schools as opposed  to what's happening now, which is, you know, if it works in business, the whole Jack Welch  just, you know, drop it on education. Well, you know, I, you were right in picking up, because I started answering a question just  a second ago. Is that, well, I'm not an educator, I don't know what all the tensions are.

I understand why we have a little bit of this problem in the church, for example, when  we examine ministers who are coming in who want to be ordained ministers, the easiest  way to do it is we give this, we give them an enormously, we do this, we're presbyterians. So, you know, you have to master this much doctrine, and we give these very detailed  exams on doctrine, but what you really want to assess is, do they know how to, what's  their bedside manner like? Do they know how to inspire people to want to believe in God and to know Christ and that's  not quantifiable? It's not quantifiable easily. It's much harder to find out whether this is a person who really can be a gospel minister  like that.

I want to, the way I can just systematically just create a, you know, kind of a production  assembly line is tests and scores, and, you know, you got this score on theology, this  score on Bible, this score on church history, this score on this, and hey, they got 97. Again, we all know, of course, that you can get 97% on all the scores and be a terrible  minister, as you all know. So how do you assess it, unfortunately, as soon as you're talking about character and wisdom,  I don't know how to do it, other than to say, you have to, you have to create communities  who evaluate people communally, you know, you have, it's not actually not that hard to  see of a kid is doing better in school, is showing an interest in learning, is relating  well to his classmates, I don't know, can you quantify that a little bit, usually the  grades go up, yeah, you can quantify that, somebody is it completely quantifiable, is  it, maybe, no, it's probably not, so I think probably what you have to do is you have  to, I don't know how this works, but you have to try to argue for letting the schools  do not be quite as test score oriented, that's all I can tell you, I, and that's not  the movement, is it, the movement's all in the other direction. Well, it's kind of what I'm saying is that they state they're speaking both ways, because  it's instruction, instruction, that the money is, you know, spent to bring in people  like Sergi Avani, who are giving exactly the opposite message, who says that, you know, kids  create social capital outside, if you don't allow them to create it in their schools,  then they'll create it on their own, and that's why we have the problems, we have a school  of violence, which you know is, you know, driving a lot of the conversation in the city  with the impact schools, police officers in schools, so it's kind of, you know, but people  that, it's kind of as if we'll be quiet about that, they know where it's working, and  I've had conversations with teachers in here, I see some people out here where their  classrooms work in the middle of absolute chaos, and the reason is because of what we're  talking about, but you're told, well, it's really about the work, so there's kind of this  unspoken, so it's, I guess part of the question too, is how much do you reference the real  reason for it, because my school is turning around, why I have five rules, one of them  is treat others the way you want to be treated, I understand that's not addressing long-term  things that I can't do as a parent, that it's at least establishing, you understand  so, but it's all just as if, keep in the golden rule, you're making it, you're making  explicit, and you're basically judging the kids on the golden rule, but that's not something  to be tested. Right, yeah.

But it ultimately impacts test scores, like, you know, how much do you say, because the  classrooms that are working, when they ask why, and they find out, it's typically a teacher  who's using that philosophy, it's not about the instructional approach that they're using,  so how far do you go and engaging people in that? Well, as far as you can, because don't you think, in some case, your superior will just  take your head off, if you're in other places, it won't, try to put yourself in a place  where you think that there's, as you know, the public, it's like a swimming pool, your  public school system has got hot spots and cold spots, try to get into a hot spot, and  push what you know is the right way. Take questions, right? Okay. I have one.

Oh, we have another one. I'm sorry. Yes. As a Christian administrator, what do you see all roles in terms of how we lead our schools  and as part of a community? You know, many schools, people go in and they come out of the Dan, there's no interaction  with the community, and I think we have a responsibility, and more so as Christian  educate and administrators, and so what do you see all roles?

Yeah. You're right. It's your job to convince the people of that. Here's a suggestion of a book. I guess in the end it looks pretty pessimistic, but I got a lot out of it.

A friend of mine wrote a book called The Death of Character by James Hunter, and it's actually  about moral education. And his basic point, which is kind of hard to argue with, maybe you could get some stuff  out of the book to use on your teachers, is to say communities create character. He says case studies don't do it. He says communities create character where the kids see certain behavior models, and they  see people saying something of the same thing. If the teachers don't talk to each other, each one of you is an independent operator, just  an entrepreneur, you're not a community at all.

And the point is the character is formed by the community. It's not, you can't be formed in a classroom. You can't, you know, you give great case studies. Here's justice. Here's equity.

Here's love. Here's patience. But unless they see equity and love and patience modeled for them, they're not going  to learn it. And they have to see it affirmed and reinforced that way. So if your teachers don't believe it, to the degree, your teachers believe it, and  to the degree you make it a community, to that degree will be an effective school.

I know it's a big fight. You want to have people ask questions? I teach high school in the South Bronx, and luckily everyone in the Bronx knows they  need God, so, or something, so they let me pray for their kids. I don't really have an issue. I teach in public school.

But what do you do when you rejuvenate yourself? Because as a teacher already, I feel like, and you are a teacher, I mean, you come back  with your, right? And you're real strong. I'm a teacher. Right.

Okay. Good. Thank you. An educator, really. Like as an educator, you take this sabbatical, right?

You take this time in the summer, and I want to know, what do you, what parts of you do,  you feel depleted after doing this for many years, because it's finally my second year. And what parts do you know God needs to work in you? Because I feel like this summer, I taught again, I didn't take time off, but I'm feeling  kind of, you know, I'm saying worn down, so what do you do, and have you come about after  a number of years? Yeah. Okay.

Well, I have to, as you prop, some of you, if you're counting, I actually take two months  away from preaching. And what I'm doing for one of those months is I'm actually writing, I decided to try  to pull together a book each year, or if I, I'm not saying I can write a book every  year, but I'm trying, I'm trying to write a book, trying to work on a book for one month. One of the advantages of that is it's, it's actually fairly hard work, but it's not  out with people, it's, it's more research, and I usually get terrific amount of ideas  for my sermons from working on the book. The second thing I do is for one month, I take a whole month off as vacation, but during  that month, I, I probably triple my amount of prayer, like I try to do two or three hours  a day. It sounds like, wow, what a spirit to go, wow, I mean, I'm reading, you know, I'm reading  the Bible and it's not like I'm just sitting there looking, looking at, I don't look at  the clouds for three hours, I, you know, I use the book of common prayer and I, you  know, you know, read meditative letters and sermons and study the Bible and pray.

And I actually, the other thing is, I've got a, probably about 12 people, I don't mean  people, really, like couples, people that I've known for many, many years, are people  that I, that I can relax with, people that I can, can find in, people that I can share  with, what, what I'm facing, and I make sure I get around to them. Actually, I try to take vacations with them if I possibly can. So it's a, it's a, it's a whole month of very intensive people, time and prayer time. And one month of very, actually, fairly intensive, actually, what I like about the week,  the year, what's left month, the month of working on a book is I actually have more time  to work than I can, working on my sermons for the rest of the year because I, you know,  I have so much time every week because I'm busy, I'm out, I'm doing stuff like this. So it's, it's really, like, really in the ivory tower for a month.

And then really out with people and praying for a month. But a change is as good as a rest, by the way, but you do, if I was just preaching, which  I, I used to, I used to, I, what I used to do is I used to go on vacation and people  said, oh, when you're in the, in the memory, would you please preach down here? And I used to do that. And that was not a good idea. You have to let the land, live, follow for a while, otherwise you, it, it pleats and eventually  you can't get any more crumbs out of it.

Okay, that's a little bit. Yes, go ahead. Good evening, bless you, hi, everybody. I've always worked in underserved schools. I started out working in East New York and then I transferred to the South Bronx.

And I did what was called integration transfer, schools that need to be diversified. Well, this September was my first time going to District 2 in Virginia, now I'm just  a 21st and 1st Street, some majority Caucasian and Asian students, there are some Hispanics  and blacks there. But at the other schools, the underserved schools, you had the freedom to teach what you wanted  to teach and use the books you wanted to use. And at this school, everything's very regimented, we have to teach, free the mighty of Mice  and Men. And I'm having a hard time with some of the literature, because, you know, of Mice and Men  there's a lot of expertise in it, and I don't want to meet a lot of the books in class.

I want some suggestions. No, are you saying, are you saying you would like some help with, you know, how to, how  to teach it or you just don't know, you have to read certain books and certain books. You have to read it out loud. I'm comfortable, yes, I'm not comfortable with saying certain, where are the certain  books? Well, I know it's like, I know it's, I know it's, I know it's, I know it's, I know it's  like, it sounds like a sort of a pastor should answer, but I, I'll go out and say, it seems  to me that when you're doing it as a teacher, I mean, the, the, the Christian actors have  asked me something similar and only as worse.

What they say is, okay, I'm a Christian and here I am being called to act and say something  that I, you know, I use exploatives or actually act in a certain way that I don't really  agree with them. I said, well, if you read the Bible, there's a lot of horrible things in the Bible. If there's places in the Bible that talk about some pretty bad things, in fact, there's  a lot of, a lot of the, sometimes you know this because I say this in the, in the services,  the translation sometimes kind of, purify what the Hebrew and the Greek actually are saying. It's telling you the story about how bad things really are. People really talk like this.

People really do these awful things. It's not, you don't want to have to even look at that, but the purpose of the literature  is to bring it out. And so I would say that there's nothing wrong with you saying it out loud because in a  certain sense, you're an actor when you're reading it. You're taking the role. It's not who you really are.

You're getting the book across to the kids. They certainly have heard the exploatives. They live in New York City. But I'm always telling them, you know, I don't swear at them in this case. Yeah.

You're right. No, no, no. Yeah. I think I ought to just say this. I'm doing this for the book, but I don't want to hear anybody talking like this in my hearing  and I don't talk like this.

Okay. Yeah. Okay. On a different note, I'd like to ask you something about exhaustion, just to follow  on from what you were saying. I have a very good summer and I'm totally relaxed and I'm enthusiastic to start the year  and after a week.

It's already, I feel like I'm too tired to do anything and I think one of the difficulties  with teaching is you never get to an end point. There's never a point where you feel, okay, I've done everything I need to do and that's  it and that I can switch off. And the marking keeps coming but it's not even that it's the going through lessons in  my mind and continually not being able to switch off the job and the weekend comes along  and the entire, you know, Sunday is spent doing marking and preparing. So when, for example, the services changed from the 930 to the 1030, I was annoyed because  it meant I got home later and couldn't do as much schoolwork, but I mean, it seems like  I can't get this under control and I've been teaching for 15 years and every year I,  you know, say to myself, I'm going to achieve a balance and it never happens. So I'm just...

What time do you get home? Do you work at night? I'm at school at about quarter to seven every morning and I get home at about seven o'clock  in the evenings. And then the weekends as well. Do you work on things at night?

No. Yeah. Think about this. I was a... I've always been...

I've always tend to overwork and I've always worked probably about 75, 80 hours a week,  all my life as a minister and yet here's... If you think of your... You have seven days unless you think of morning afternoon and evening and admittedly  if your evening starts at seven, it's a little bit of... I mean, that's all right. You still have three hours or so of rooms.

So you have morning... So you have 21 segments, right? Seven days, three times? I wasn't a math major. Math teachers is seven times three times one?

Okay. You have 21 segments. Make sure that you take seven of them off under all circumstances that you're not teaching  and you're not working on lessons seven. Then I have been able to do that. I have to take one day a week off, two days, there's three.

And that means somewhere I have to take one afternoon and one afternoon off and three  other evenings off because I'm out evenings, I work evenings sometimes. If you can take off seven, you can survive. I have for quite a long time in my kids, for some strange reason, do not remember me being  an absentee father, which is still something I don't know how I dodge that bullet. Caddies is where you take those seven if you've got kids. Just make sure and sabbath yourself and also everything is do some reading that has  nothing to do with your job and make sure be disciplined about that and say I'm going  to have at least two or three hours a week reading.

Maybe even every night, an hour, some book that you're working through that has nothing  to do with your job always makes you feel like you've got more of a life. Just a couple ideas. Seven out of 21. Yeah, Rebecca. I actually tell my teachers to go home and I go home and because the thing, this reference  is what we were talking about to be fresh and to have ideas for them and to be emotionally  rested, that's what they're getting in my opinion more out of than the actual lessons  that you're preparing.

So you might not even recognize how you're not able to interact in the situations when  they're high pressure. So you just have to step out and you are not your job. I say that to my teachers, you are Hillary, you are a teacher that you don't become your job  especially as a Christian that's, you have an easier way to ground yourself and say this  is where it ends. And if you get less than thoughts, I know that happens all the time, you know, get up  and write them down and then leave it because it's just not sustainable. And I think you have to remember ultimately what they are getting is the spirit that you're  bringing to it.

And if you're exhausted and you're not replenishing yourself with what's great for you,  the jam or whatever it is, then it's going to show. Anybody else here want to say something about it? You just do not work in the summits. And okay, what your finances are, do not work in the summits. Katherine, can we still take a question or two?

Yeah, go ahead. I was a teaching fellow and for the, that the two years and I was teaching fellow, I  felt like it was a race and I got to my second year and I said, I'm done, I'm going  to leave my school and go for somewhere a little bigger and better. But it was actually, I teach in the Bronx and it's actually the parents that convinced  me to stay at my school. And you know, for all the great reasons. So with that said, Rebecca, you know, used that something about the golden rule, teaching  the golden rule.

I have 26 kindergartners in my Bronx classroom and all we do is teach the golden rule to them  about being loved one another, be kind to one another. But what do you do when these kids go home to these parents who obviously are not communicative  with their teachers who teach the extreme opposite? Because we do really well in the classroom. There's no violence in the classroom. But out on the playground, why did you hit that kid?

Because my mommy told me that if somebody hits me, I hit him back. So this is something that goes beyond the classroom, beyond your role as a teacher. And how do you address this? You can't go to a parent and say, you got to practice the golden rule. So what is a practical approach to these parents?

Teachers. I run parenting workshops. One of the things we did in October 2nd, and Janet was at the piece, what we did was,  we invited parents with a community-based organization, once convention, and we did  a drama workshop, a dance workshop, and a drawing of media workshop. And we did it as a family day, where we called out time with the families we invited the children  with the parents to our school. I think it's an administrative capacity, that you need to go to your administrator and  ask them to think creatively about not having a parent meeting where you're sitting.

In fact, one of the parents said it was at the meeting at the end. We debriefed, and they said to me, this is so refreshing, whenever I went to a parent  meeting before, all the administrator did was bark pieces at me, you know? And my deal is like, I'm not interested in doing things like barking at people. I want them to sit down and actually do activities with their children, and we invited staff  to also do those activities, but I think you need to go to your administrator and say,  I'm having an issue here. Can we brainstorm ways of solving that?

I think you need to do that holistically at different times throughout your community. We have a difficult population in my place. I'm with who have parents who have a lot of the same issues you're saying, and then  high school. By the way, you can do that as a principal, though, because she couldn't do it as a teacher. She could go to a principal.

Okay. Yes, the question. But, I mean, my principal does that. We do Saturday workshops, family workshops, but these parents don't come. They don't come to them.

They don't come to parent-teacher conferences. They don't come when you call them, they don't pick up the phone. And, you know, I want to stay and I want to do this, and I want to work with these parents  who are absent in their kids' school lives. So what can I do as a teacher to go out there and talk to these parents? What, one of the things that worked, and this is the story of my life, I've been in four  hours of meetings today trying to explain some of the same things.

And if you're just very, if you explain it logically, which is, I understand that on the  street, because this is exactly what, I mean, my kids get jumped, they're afraid to confess  who's doing what? Because they get jumped when they leave school. It's very serious. There's bloods members. I mean, I know it's the same story a lot of us have, but the explanation is school.

When you enter the door of school and the yard is school, that is part of your responsibility. What happens at recess? So I have not had a parent yet that doesn't come to the agreement, and I have, I have  had parents write it, put it in writing, I am telling them to hit back just so you know. But once you have a conversation with them, and you can do this as a teacher, which is,  how do I protect your child? If you're telling your child to hit back, and he's telling his child to hit back, and  then everyone's hitting, and when I say to them, I don't want to you serve your authority.

And they always respect that. I don't want to you serve your authority, but I can't protect them. What if it's your child the next time whose parents said the same thing? So when they walk inside the school door, we have to operate differently. And I say to them, I can't tell you what to do on the street.

I understand that's a different issue, but inside the school doors, if you could help us  by saying to the child, give the teachers and the staff the opportunity, give me the opportunity  to keep them safe. Is that what you say? Yes. Okay. Administrators do, you know, villains, even today I understand there were some situations  like that where a parent actually tried to hit another student, and the administrators  have to step in and make the parents realize what would you want us to do for your child?

And I think once you bring it home to the parent, that his child could be the next victim,  then they do step back and really think a little more rationally. It's a bit logical with the process and the follow-up through, they usually come home. Is there great answers? Go ahead. Can you hear me?

One thing is, you know, it's sort of under the current and all conversations with educators  is as your teachers, trying to implement kind of the big picture up above from administration  and from for the public school teachers, the DOE, and I've been a teacher, so I understand  that, but sort of on the other side of the coin, I'm now with the DOE, and I just wanted  to let you all know that it's incredibly encouraging for me to be here tonight. And for what it's worth, there is somebody at the DOE, praying for you all every day. It's probably hard to leave, but... And I will certainly say I would appreciate and we'd all, well, I would appreciate your  prayers as well. And then my quick question for you all is, when I was a teacher and I both worked as  a teacher in the public schools and then worked with the parochial schools in the Bronx  and Manhattan, there were a few moments where I just could really send you a message  that God was sort of showing me that the way I was interacting with the parent or my attitude  in a certain circumstance was totally infused by the grace that he had given me as a Christian  and I'm sorry, I'm a little upset.

And so my question for you all is maybe if you have a little anecdotal story from your  own experiences and educators, if when you just said, like, gosh, I couldn't have handled  that unless I had this world view. I'll begin. We talked about that we prayed, many of us prayed and we said we couldn't start out  day without prayer either reading the Bible or even at school or with others because what  I got to school each day, it's with a sense of adventure because we never know, you know,  you have the best laid plans and everyone is supposed to be in place and then a child  falls and gets cut. We had an anecdote, a kindergarten kid fell in the yard and they thought that she had just  bumped her chin and when she went to the doctor, she had fractured her jaw and her jaw had  to be wired and it was with fear and trembling. How do you speak to that parent when she comes?

What do you say to a parent in that case? How would a parent react? So there was always this prayer and the parent comes in and the administrators there we talked  to the parent and then sometimes they come in very hostile, sometimes they have issues  and they just need someone to talk to and as we speak to them and asking the Holy Spirit  to put the right words and at least in our mouth as we speak, the parents sometimes they  become very calm or that parent may just cry or we need just a hug that we have instances  of children whose parents are dying and they know they are dying and they have issues  of what's going to happen to my child and just a hug and then when that parent leaves  and they feel better or the situation is calm and we say thank God, you know, God is  so good that we say it all the time because we had no thought or no plan of how we would  face that situation so it happens I think almost daily at my school. Just going back to the parent issue that June brought up a few minutes ago, it just happened  actually before I got here and I said I spent a lot of time investigating the game related  incident and I actually school safety had to walk out to parents today because they were  so enraged over the conversation and I guess to be honest like one of your first tendencies  would be while I wasn't able to complete the investigation because you had to be escorted  out because of your behavior so maybe I'll just go ahead and record it as this did happen  without getting to the bottom of it but I persisted for another rest of the day and I called  the parent back on the phone which was really not what I thought I should probably do before  coming here and trying to be positive after the way the last meeting went but I told her  the status of the investigation and that her son actually had not been one of the parties  that had participated in the in the occurrence and she said, Ms. Marlon, I felt so bad all  day I just wanted to apologize to you and so I just knew that in that like the fact  of just being able to call her back it was not it was just the grace of God just giving  me that after it had been you know two or three people walking out and I know that was  just totally grace.

You're trying to re-weave something that you can tell needs to be related  these things need to be related to each other and they're not and it's very very very frustrated  but you're Christians and you know what that means that means that you eventually the things you  want to see happen are going to happen there will eventually be peace there will eventually be  justice there will eventually be whole families there will eventually you won't have parents dying  you're going to have a re-woven creation God is going to do it I mean there's a lot of jobs  that are more satisfying than your job because you're making something and you make it  well and then you send it out there and people buy it you make your money you go home your  product are change lives and maturity and wisdom and therefore you're always unhappy with your  product I mean it's just never what you want it to be it's very very frustrating but your  Christians it's you're not fighting a losing battle at all everything sad is going to come on  true someday so you're on the right side and you've got to live in that kind of hope now let's pray  Father we thank you that you have called us in this room to be educators and that you've called  us into a job that it seems so messy it's not like producing a piece of machinery and it's selling  it it's not like so many other jobs in which the product is a quantifiable and the bottom line  is so much easier to to grasp and to drive and to recognize we're talking about change lies we're  talking about learning wisdom we're talking about maturity we're talking about people becoming  real human beings and it seems like an endless maybe losing cause but it's not we know it's not  because of Christians and we thank you for all the ways in which the men and women in this room  are your agents for healing in the world and repairing and reweaving your creation thank you that  the resurrected Jesus proves to us that someday you will completely you will fulfill our deepest  desires to see our city hole in this family's hole so thank you for this time and continue to be our  great teacher Jesus Christ and his name we pray. Amen.

Yeah, I was actually a real-life formal teacher for five years at Graduate School Seminary  actually lectured and I created tests and I graded tests and papers for five years. I said, get me back in the ministry where you can teach and teach you nobody knows whether  the people are learning or not. It's wonderful.

There's no way to find out. It seems like so, took all the pressure off. Let me, let, yes, okay. Let me suggest, the only book that CS Lewis ever wrote on public education, that's what this  book's supposedly about, the abolition of man, little booksy, short books, the sort of thing  that everybody wants. Let me share two thoughts from the book.

If you are a teacher and have never read it, or if you haven't read it in a long time,  I suggest you read it because it is about education. The first essay is called Men Without Chests, very famous and in it, he takes a book that  was written at the time, I guess, in the 1940s, a book that was supposedly a textbook for  English literature for high school students, what we call high school. And in the book, there's this great quote here, that Lewis quotes. He says, the textbook says, when people say a waterfall is sublime, they think they are  saying something very important about the waterfall, but they are only saying something about  their feelings about the waterfall. And Lewis pointed out that this is the very essence of modern, this is the essence of  modernity.

This is the essence of modern Western culture. What they were saying is, if you talk about an objective fact, something that can be  proven, something that's empirically investigatable, that's a fact. But if you say anything that can't be proven empirically, if you say adultery is a sin,  or I believe in God, or a waterfall is sublime, you're just talking about feelings. It's subjective. It's not really important, David said.

And Lewis points out, this is the essence, and this is if you're a public school teacher,  this is the essence of your problem. That you're allowed to talk about, supposedly, you're allowed to talk about anything that's  subjective, empirically proven, something that can be rationally investigated. But when it comes to moral values, religious beliefs, I believe in God, I think adultery  is wrong. Whenever you get into anything that can't be proven, that's subjective. That's supposed to be kept private.

You're not allowed to talk about that. It's of course a big hot issue, but in politics, am I allowed to bring my moral views into  the public realm? Some people say, no, of course not. You don't bring your religious or moral views into the public, into politics. There we only talk about what's reasonable and rational, not what you think is your moral  values.

Lewis responds by saying, if you really believe that everything is relative, and it comes  to morality, he has this very famous place where he says, he says, if you're actually  educating students in this way, if you're actually educating students to believe,  that things that are objective, fact, are one thing. But all moral views, all views about morality, religion, or anything like that is completely  subjective, completely to be kept private. Completely relative, that is, to your individual consciousness or to the culture you're  in. He says, you realize what's going to happen, and this is the quote that ends that essay. He says, you can hardly open a periodical without coming across a statement that our civilization  needs drive or more self-sacrifice.

In a sort of ghastly simplicity, we remove the organ and demand the function. We make men without chests and expect to them virtue and enterprise. We laugh at honor and our shock to find traders in our midst. We castrate and bid the gildings be fruitful. And what he's really saying is, if you really say everything is relative, except that which  is empirically proven, self-sacrifice, why be self-sacrificial?

Why care about the common good? Why be a good citizen? Why? He says, you can't educate people like that. So what's the answer?

He actually brings out something called the Dow. And what he means by the Dow, T-A-O, taken by way from the Chinese idea that there is a  kind of, it's natural law. He says he believes that, and most all religions believe, that the religions actually differ on  many things like how you're saved. All human beings have some basic understanding of God and some basic understanding of right  and wrong that we kind of know intuitively. And Lewis makes a case that on the basis of that, what Catholics would call natural law  and what Protestants would call common grace.

On the basis of the fact that people know some things intuitively, you can educate and  you can appeal on the basis of this understanding that there's such a thing as common grace. Now, what do I mean by that? It's actually very important for both people who are in Christian schools or private schools  as well as public schools. And I'm here, by the way, I'm giving you a more Protestant view of natural, long common  grace. The Protestant view is if you have a thin understanding of sin that is just breaking  certain rules, you should make that more robust, a thick understanding of sin according  to the Bible, a thick, robust view of sin, is that sin is making anything more central  than God.

Sin is idolatry. So nationalism and making your family or making your moral record or making doctrinal  purity, the thing that makes us better than everybody else. Those are all forms of idolatry and self-righteousness, but of course materialism, sex, power, aggressive  violence. They're all idols. And so a robust understanding of sin is not just your breaking rules because as you know,  the Pharisees were horrible sinners because they were terribly self-righteous and filled  with pride and were terrible people, even though they were being all the rules.

Secondly, if you want to understand natural law and common grace, you have to have a thick  understanding of grace. And here's what I mean by a thick understanding of grace. You need to understand that in Romans chapter 1, verse 18 to 25, we read this. I can find it. It says yes.

Romans 1, 25 says, since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities have been clearly  seen being understood from what has been made, so men are without excuse. Now what's that saying is all human beings basically know the golden rule, basically  know we must not be selfish, basically know we should care for our families, basically  know a right and wrong, but they repress it. But what's interesting is the verbs are being understood, are being seen, are present  passive participles. And what that means is that at any given time, every human being on the face of the earth  is experiencing, in their innermost being, a dialogue between what they know about God  and what they know about right and wrong and their own idolatrous hearts. So every cultural product, every poem, every work of art, every essay, every op-ed piece,  everything that is ever produced has, is a result of that dialogue, which means that  if you're, if I'm a Christian and I'm producing a cultural product, which is a sermon by  the way, that there's idolatry in it, there's something wrong with it, there's idolatrous  discourse in it.

I'm in some way, I'm never quite hitting it just right, I might have pride in my own  perspiterianism, I might have just a lack of humility in the way in which I speak. I mean, in other words, there's both truth in what I'm saying and idolatry. But in non-Christians, according to Romans 1, people who even overtly say they're not,  they don't believe in God, when they produce movies, when they produce films and they produce  art, when they produce essays, there's always some witness to God's truth in there. It shows there's good things being stated by non-Christians all the time because of common  grace. And C.S.S.L.S. says, you have to understand common grace, you have to have a robust view  of sin and a robust view of grace if you're going to educate, and here's the reason why.

If this is the case, this is one of the reasons why when I get asked this question, it's  hard for me to believe that Christian education, Christian schools, or public education, Christians  and public schools is, it's hard for me to believe that either one of those is the only  way to go. It's hard for me to believe that's the only way to educate people. It seems to me that if you're in a Christian school, I did have, as you're going to hear  in a minute, I've had my children everywhere, which shows a lack of discipline or a lack  of cohere in philosophy or maybe I have some other reasons, but it's not hard for me  to see that when I put my kids in Christian schools very often they come out with some ways  in which they're learning the Bible. You can see idolatrous discourse, you can see rigidity, I've never forgotten my first  grade son comes home from his Christian school in Hope, Virginia, and he says, we were praying  for the children in public schools today, why? Because they can't pray and their faith is being assaulted all the time, it's first  greater.

While there's some idolatrous discourse in that, okay, that's all. On the other hand, in the public school, here you're going to be having to educate not  by quoting the Bible if you're Christian, but by appealing to natural, uncommon grace. You have to expect that, first of all, people who aren't believers or who are believers  and other religions are going to have some understanding of the truth, you know, just  to give you a real example, obvious example, rape. Almost everybody thinks rape is wrong, why? Can you prove it scientifically?

Absolutely not. Is it rational, well, it's practical, but there's no rational or empirical way to prove  that rape is wrong. Why don't we all think rape is wrong? Why is it enshrined in our legislation? And why can we say, in a public school room, that rape is wrong?

Do you realize that's a value? That is a faith bleep. That is something we believe is wrong, but we could never prove, but common grace and  natural relation, no matter almost who we are, we all intuitively know it. Now what you have to do is you have to find those other places, you have to reason on  the basis of natural, uncommon grace, and lastly, just to code here, one of the things  that's important to realize is increasingly, though I need some of you are going to say,  I don't see it, okay, but I see it. Increasingly it's going to be harder and harder for public schools or in fact for our public  institutions to keep maintaining this difference between fact and value.

More and more people are recognizing that everything you say is based on faith assumptions,  like I just gave you the example of rape. When someone says, we all know rape is wrong, why do we know rape is wrong? That's an act of faith. That's a moral judgment. And when someone says, you can't bring your moral judgments into the classroom, you have  to realize everybody's doing that.

Everybody is saying, on the basis of my understanding of the nature of reality, on the basis of my  understanding of the story that I think we're all in, there's an individualistic enlightenment  story that says there's really no truth except human rights and we also be free to decide  what is right around for us, but that's a story. That's a way of understanding all of reality, it's a world view, it's a faith thing, you  can't prove that. And if you're a Christian teacher, whether you're in private schools at our Christian or  your public schools at our Christian or your Christian schools, it's going to be increasingly  important and possible to show your students that everything that every statement practically  comes embedded in a moral view of the world view, and you have to identify it as such. So you know, you say Martin Luther King Jr. worked for civil rights because why did he  do it? Did he say, everything is relative and every individual has to decide what is right  of frame or hurt?

He said, because the Bible says so, he did do that, he said, let justice roll down. He was an African-American Protestant, and within his understanding, the reason, as you  know, I guess the reason that black activists went into civil disobedience as opposed to  what their white liberal friends said in the 1950s, was their white liberal friends were  humanists who didn't believe the human beings were sinful. But the black activists who were reading Reinhold Niebuhr and the Bible, they did know that  human beings were sinful, and they were never going to, that the Americans, white Americans  would not give up power unless they were pushed, and that they wanted to do it in a way that  was still Christian and loving, so they did civil disobedience, peaceful civil disobedience. You have to show that what Martin Luther King Jr. did came out of a particular understanding  of human nature and of God and of right and wrong, because everybody who says anything, even  people who believe in human rights, that comes out of an enlightenment view of what life  is like. Increasingly, you're going to be able, you're going to have to tell people these stories and  let your students recognize how every moral claim, every claim of any sort is embedded in  a worldview.

You have to be able to say that, increasingly, the people at the top, the philosophers know  there's no such thing as reason that is just unembedded in a particular understanding  of ultimate reality, and increasingly, you're going to be able to do it too. So on the basis of common grace, on the basis of this understanding of things, I actually  think that it means those of us in Christian education, like me, have to recognize the limited  nature of our Christian education. Those of you who are Christians in public education have to realize, I think, real possibilities  for instructing people in wisdom, and maybe increasing possibilities in talking openly  about various faith views. So now, I've saying that because my guess is that when I get these questions now, I'm  going to tend to refer to this basic insight that comes from the abolition of men. Okay?

So I'm supposed to lead for the next 45 minutes. Well, I'm supposed to take questions and I think what this means is panel. You're supposed to shoot me questions about, first of all, what kind of school, private,  public, Christian, home schooling, isn't that right, Catherine? Let's try, let's shoot me questions about that for a while, and I'll try to make answers,  and you can maybe respond, and then I'll start to. I think when we talk about choices and philosophy, what really comes down to is how we live  all lives and where we place our children and where we choose to live.

So I know from a long term relationship with you, actually, your youngest son went  to a Bronx science and he had a math tutor who was a teacher to Christian school that I  was running at the time. Right, my oldest son went to public school all the way through. All the way through. New York public schools. New York public schools.

But I know for sure that you sent your other children right to Christian boarding schools. And my question that I had for you was how you've gone to that process, why, what the  difference was in the choices, why you made those choices, and going back on reflection,  how would your advice parents today to live their lives with their children? Okay, there's two questions. First would be, why did I do what I did? My three sons, we've been here almost 16 years, well, over into our 16th year, our oldest  son went through public school all the way.

Our other two sons went to public school, Michael, my middle son went to public school until  ninth grade and I sent him to Stony Brook, which is a Christian boarding school without  one and a half away. And my youngest son, Jonathan, went, I think, till fourth grade to public school, from  fifth grade to eighth grade, went to a Catholic school, so I'm really diverse, by the way. And then went, and then he went to Stony Brook, the Christian boarding school as well. Number one, I really mean it. My wife, I talked about, make sure my wife and I were still in agreement on this before  I came.

Is that we really do see advantages to the various forms of education. We do not, and I would be disappointed if Christians didn't vigorously go into every  one of these kinds of education, private, Christian, private, and public. I think we can do a huge amount of good and renewal in each one of them. And that's why, because I had no philosophical problems with any one of them, we were free  to choose the one that we thought fit the kid. We didn't have a problem with Christian education or problem with public education, therefore  we were able to make a choice.

If he had gotten into towns and Harris, we might have kept him here. He tried to get into towns and Harris, but in hindsight, we really made the right choice  because he would have been living at home and that wasn't the best thing for him. Jonathan just insisted he wouldn't want to go to Stony Brook, too. And when we looked back on it, we're still not sure it was the best idea, but it was  also... we thought it was okay, and so he did it because he really, really wanted. And this is, by the way, those of you who are parents as well as teachers know, this  is how you do this.

You do it on a case-by-case basis. Now, if we thought public school was no good, or Christian schools, no, no, no, none of that,  we would have not been able to have all those options, but we have. In fact, by the way, on top of that, my sister, my dear sister, I love to the sky, is the  best home schooler I know. She's home school. A lot of people believe it or not.

You say, well, not only all of her five children, but everybody else's children in the neighborhood,  I think. And it's been... so I've gone all around the block. What would we say today to... I would say the same thing, just to parents who are Christians  that you do have a number of options and that you really ought to do it on a case-by-case  basis, and I would actually hope that Christians would somehow be well-distributed. I do think we actually need to need more Christian schools in a city than we've got.

I also think we need Christians to be much more actively involved in the public schools  and renewal of the public schools. I would like all the thousands of flowers to bloom. I really think it's really possible. I think because a lot of us... it's hard... if you're into public schools as a teacher,  I hope you'll feel like this is the... there's nothing wrong with you feeling like your  approach is the superior one. If you don't feel a little...

I mean, I like to... there's this really odd tension. I want to feel... I want everybody on my staff to feel like there's no church-like redeemer. You know, you've got to feel like this is the greatest church. You have to be careful about that because it's more emotional than it is intellectual.

You stand back. You have to say no, wait a minute. There are a lot of other great churches. So you should feel the same way if you're into public... if you want to create great  Christian schools for the city and you define that and you really want to do that, that's  all right for you to feel like this is my passion, this is what I want to do. And to feel like...

I want to recruit as many people into that as possible, and vice versa  for public schools as well. So that's the reason why I... we have to do a case-by-case basis. Okay, other questions? I just want to give a little background. I'm not a product of Christian and public schools, so I think not only what fits the... what  fits the child, but different times in the child's life, so I think you know, that's  very important.

I also just want to kind of make a point about why I'm sitting here as an administrator,  as a direct result, Catherine mentioned that I'm in the Leadership Academy. The reason I'm in a Leadership Academy to make a very long story short is from a conversation  on a site visit that Chancellor Klein had to a school that I was working at in East Flatbush,  a failing school teacher there, and I couldn't wait till he got there to tell him everything  that was wrong and to talk about, how can you let children live in these conditions? So anyway, out of that conversation, and he said, well, how did you get the students  to read? Their older siblings can't even read. And so did you do this?

And did you do that? And was it where you went to graduate school? And was it that? And I said, actually, it's about creating a caring community for us. So every day in my classroom, I start with morning meetings and we talk about what it means  to treat each other the way we want to be treated.

And I went through this whole thing, expecting him to, you know, run away, because that  has nothing to do with the reform effort that they were moving in terms of the unified  curriculum. And actually, his response was he listened for about 30 minutes and he said, can you please  email all of that to me? And I thought, well, you know, that's just some kind of, you know, let me make her feel  good. She gave me all this garbage or whatever. But is the conversation went on?

He said, as a matter of fact, I really need you to apply for this program. And I said, which program? And he said, the leadership academy, and you know, nothing about it. And I said, oh, no, I want to be a teacher. I have no interest in administration.

And he said, I know, that's exactly why I need you there. So what I ended up emailing him was a policy memo, basically entitled transforming New York  City Schools with the Golden Rule. And no doubt about it, that's been the voice that I've brought to the leadership academy  and that I'm trying to bring to this school. So I just want to say that that is very true that there's so many opportunities. And we're in such a crisis in public education that I'll be honest with you.

They don't really care where you say it comes from as long as it works. So what goes hand in hand with that is the quality. You can't go around and say I'm a Christian, I'm a Christian, and yet you're doing substandard work  and too often that becomes a crutch. So I just want to re-emphasize that this is, you know, and for all of it, you know, not talking about politics. There is an open opportunity to impact the schools.

That's my context for the question that I agree with Tim. What I do have a problem with is that the loudest voices in Christianity today seem  to be people that are anti-public schools and anti-having Christian students and public schools. And I do believe that there's different settings for every child. But I just want to read a statement that kind of set off my whole concern. This is by Mr.

Rae Moore, who runs an organization called the Exodus Mandate  that are asking all Christians to remove their students from their children from public schools. The quote is, a movement to purge the public schools of Christian children  would literally electrify and invigorate the church as nothing has done in modern times. And might trigger the revival we are all awaiting so expectantly. So that, and that's actually has supportive Dr. James Dobson of Kennedy.

So this is what's circulating. And I'm, you know, maybe not here, but in other places in the country. So I guess my question is, and I have asked this also to an email kind of dialogue with Mr. Moore,  especially in a city like this in a crisis. We can all acknowledge the crisis situation.

What do we as Christians? What is our responsibility to students in the public schools? And what are the ways that we can work together to bridge this divide between homeschool,  private school, Christian school, as in church, you know, so I don't know if that's a question. No, it is. Let me, I'll say something.

I want to make sure Scott or somebody asked me a question about Christian school,  if you will, I mean, so I, so the other shoe drops. But let me just say something good about, well, no, here. Should we just plant new churches? Or should we renew the churches that exist in a city? Now, I've done a lot of thinking about that since I'm a church planter.

And it is fairly easy when you plant a new church to give the impression or maybe even believe  that all the other churches around here are dead and this just won't work. So we have to start a new church that's really on fire. Now, the fact is that a city will not be reached for Christ only by new churches. There's tons and tons of people that will go to the existing church and only to the existing  church. The older church, the church that, you know, their parents and their grandparents were at,  it's only going to read.

That's the only way that a whole lot of people are going to be reached by the existing  churches, the established churches, the older churches. It's also true that unless you start new churches, the older churches don't sometimes  get, get pricked into making changes. We really found it when Redeemer got started. We started doing a lot of stuff that the other churches and towns that would never work. It did work at Redeemer.

Next thing you know, they started doing it in the older churches. There actually is therefore a need for something like a Christian school movement and there's  no doubt that there's a lot of schools that are outside of the public school system that  can do things that the public school system can learn from. You've got to have renewal like that, but you also have to renew one of the public schools  too. You just can't abandon all the students in public schools. So I know the way to reach a city is to not only plant new churches, but to renew the  old churches.

It's not any other war at all. Over the years there have been church planters who are like this people in this petition  or this movement. They're really saying the existing church is just a whole lot of crap and it's going to  hell in the hand car. We're just forgetting about it and everybody should come out and join us because we're  the true new church. It never works.

It creates friction, sectarianism, so you just have to have both as simple as that. I think that would be the thing to say. I really do believe there's going to be an opening more and more for Christians who  are careful. Not being sectarian, understanding common grace and natural law. There's going to be a way for us to be able to talk in public settings about the faith  basis for what we're saying because what you have to say, everybody's got one.

So, when you come and say this, look, that's a faith, there's a faith basis to that. You have to explain everybody, so reason for this is out, let me just finish this one. Alistair Macinty wrote a book in 1984 called After Virtue. It's had a huge impact on the thought life, especially the philosophy world. He said you can never talk about something being good unless you ask, answer the question,  what is it for?

So, he may have heard me use this illustration. You can't say whether it's a good watch unless you ask, what is it for? It's lousy for pampering nails, by the way, if you've ever tried. But it's wonderful for telling time. So the question is, is it a good watch or not or is it a bad watch?

It all depends on what it's built for, what's it for? As soon as you start to say, is this a good person? Is this a good human being? You can't answer that question unless you ask, what are human beings for? What are they mean?

What is the meaning of human life? What are we here for? What is the important stuff? And you can't answer that question from science. You can't.

There's a Hindu answer, there's a Buddhist answer, there's an individualistic enlightenment  answer, there's a secular answer, there's a Christian answer, there's a Jew, anybody  who says anything about this is good behavior, this is bad behavior, is embedding it in a  particular worldview, a set of faith assumptions. There's no way that anybody can, if you say that well, in any public setting, nobody  knows how to gain sight anymore. Because the enlightenment idea of some kind of objective, neutral view from nowhere is  gone, everybody has been against understanding that. There's got to be a way for us as Christians, therefore, even in public education, to say,  here's the way the Christian thing works, here's the way the Jewish thing works, here's  the way the Hindu things work, and talk about it with our students. Christianity, whenever it's compared, always looks pretty good.

It's got a whole lot of great practitioners like Martin Luther King Jr., if you're allowed,  for example, to make him what he really was, which is a minister of the gospel. And there's, we have an awful lot of really great examples, you can, I find in some way,  if you're in a more vangelic church, where you're always working with non-Christians, you  always are so excited about it, but you wonder, I wish I was in a church where there wasn't  as much transience, and there was, the people were there from year to year, and I could  work on discipleship. In other words, I've been in churches where every, I had a church in Virginia, where nobody  ever left, and nobody ever came, and I had a lot of, I was able to do a lot of discipleship  and deep drill down theological education, but I, I had a passion for evangelism and reaching  out. And I think if you're in public education, or if you're in Christian education, you're going  to find, in general, that you get different things done. You're going to find one that enables you to kind of talk more, and reach out to people,  and yet you always feel like, my hands are somewhat tied, I can't completely go down where  I would like to go, and very often in Christian education sometimes you feel like it's kind  of a hot house.

So I just don't know the one is the ideal, and I think we've got to have both, and anybody  who gives the impression that everybody came out of public schools and wanted to Christian  schools, that would be wrong, however. Because I'm doing this thing on Proverbs this year, I now understand probably what the  goal of a school would be, would be wisdom, which is helping kids understand how life  works, how the human heart works, so that they know how to make right choices, even in  areas where the moral rules don't apply, that would be, and I think that what's interesting  is that could be something to both public school teachers, who are Christians, and Christian  school teachers could both be trying to do, they're going to go bad a little bit differently. Having said that, Scott, you want to ask your question? Actually, I do, thank you. Since the schools are not reading yet, and that they are still to my understanding hostile  to the faith, why should parents put their children in the hands of a school system that  is so hostile, especially in light of the fact that even if the child is growing up in  a Christian home, is aware of the gospel, perhaps, or the accepted Christ, their faith  is still being formed, that it's not yet resilient, they can't stand on their own.

Why would a parent turn their child over to such an institution when their opportunities  to unwind that indoctrination is still limited? I think that is, since I don't believe in neutrality and I don't believe there's such a thing,  as I just said, therefore I have a lot of sympathy for the idea of putting my kid in the Christian  school, my children who were in Christian school benefited from it, put it this way. I have found in New York that the real anti-Christian schools are private schools. In other words, Buckley and Chapin, not Bronx Science or Stivocent. I think to be fair to non-Christian schools, we need to make that distinction.

I've seen a huge difference, and now I found the public schools in the suburbs very often,  and they're thinking, you either have secular people or Christian people, these crazy  nutty Christians. Here in the city, the public school teachers are dealing with Hindus and Muslims and  Buddhists and Jews and Christians and Orthodox Christians and Catholic Christians, and I  found them incredibly careful and unbelievably respectful. For example, every year, and in Roosevelt Island Elementary School, I was asked to come  in along with a rabbi and along with a priest and we came in and we talked about the Holy  Days because the Jewish teacher that public school teacher taught all of my kids all went  through just said, look, I really want them to understand these different points of  view, and she says, I'm even trying to make sure I don't let them think that I believe  that they're all relative. Even though she was secular, but she said, I realize in a sense that she understood that  if I just said, well, there's this view in this view and isn't it wonderful? Everybody's got their own religion, they're all equally valid.

Even to say that is actually a totalitarian point of view. That's it. Even though she could never say that's an enlightenment view, she understood that in a way  that was putting secularism over the other religions. And I think to some degree, she's scared, she's scared of some angry Hindu or Muslim or Christian  parent coming in and screaming. And I guess in New York, everybody screams and so I found that public schools were extremely  respectful of the different religions and weren't that hostile.

And seemed to even have an intuitive understanding that even secularism couldn't be pushed down  the throat of these kids, or else their parents were going to take their teachers' heads  off. I want you to know that when it comes to some of the quote unquote elite private schools  in the city, where a lot of people want to send their kids, they're there's overtly  hostile. And I'm not kidding. And they delight in dismantling any kind of traditional understanding of authority or morality. And therefore I think you ought to make a distinction.

That's the first thing. Secondly though, I was kind of glad that my kids, I think the two that were both in public  school and Christian school probably benefited. I think that then if they had been in Christian school all the way or had been in public school  all the way, I saw some advantages of that. So I don't know what that tells you, I'm just a wishy watchy Charlie Brown guy. But I think you do have to watch very carefully because I think Scott's question is right.

If you're, I was talking to parents, I would say you really need to know how hostile  or what your school district or your local school is like or what your, what the teacher's  views are like because you really don't have the right to abandon me. The Bible, Deuteronomy 6 says, parents, you are responsible for your children's upbringing. And when I can't delegate that away, I mean I can delegate away the actual day in and  day out work of teaching to somebody else but I can't delegate away the responsibility. It's estimated that most of us spend half of our waking hours at work. How does the wisdom of the Bible apply to our careers?

In other words, how can our work connect with God's work and how can our vocations be more  emotional? In his book, every good endeavor, Tim Keller draws from decades of teaching on vocation  and calling to show you how to find true joy in your work as you serve God and others. The book offers surprising insights into how a Christian perspective on work can serve  as the foundation for a thriving career and a balanced personal life. Every good endeavor is our thank you for your gift to help gospel and life share Christ's  love with more people around the world.

One of the things I've noticed in reading New York Times magazine recently, I'm sure  Tony being a journalist has noticed this, that increasingly when reporters are doing when  they're writing articles about hot topics, instead of acting like they're the all-knowing  objective omnipotent omnipresent narrator, they are making disclaimer of what where their  own position is. It was interesting this article on faith in the marketplace, it was in the cover story  of New York Times magazine last Sunday. The report did a great job and he came out and said in full disclosure disclaimer, here's  my view. This is my religious view. Nevertheless, I'm going to say this, I'm going to try to really be fair-minded and recognize  the advantages over here.

And I think that's increasingly possible. You have to, I know that there would be certain, you have to watch out with certain teachers  and certain other parents. So I would be very careful, but I bet you increasingly, if you say, well, this is where I'm coming  from, we're all coming from someplace and I just want in the interest of full disclosure  that you know that this is my viewpoint, but I really can appreciate yours. Now, I think that therefore is possible. I don't think even 10 years ago you could have done that, but I think increasingly people  are going to recognize that we're all embedded in moral communities, we're all embedded  in faith communities, that even the secular people is a kind of faith.

What's important is not do you make truth claims, but how do you treat people who have  different views? And I think that you have to say, it's not a question of whether I believe this or it's  how I treat the others, and I want to show that I really respect and I also want you  to help me understand your viewpoint and maybe this will change some of the ways in which  I see things. So I think you can be more open. But I'm afraid of, be careful, you know, don't say, oh Tim Keller said, and then you go  back and you next time you have a parent interview, you said, by the way, I'm a born again  Christian. But it needs to be relevant to the subject.

You don't just say, I want you to know, Tim, my pastor told me, I can do this, it needs  to be relevant to the subject, but if it is relevant to say something about it, it's  not bad. Somebody else. I do a lot of polling and religious issues during the campaign, and there was a sort  of a disinterest actually among certain esteemed journalistic organs here in the city until  about 7 o'clock on Tuesday evening, my mailbox was flooded with co-house. And all we had been, the sort of turned on a dying impologies, I'm sorry, we didn't publish  anything, you wrote, but now we will never think, but so you do get changes, but I do, the  one weakness is that if we're in such a position is that in graduate and undergraduate  education for teachers, we don't actually provide too many tools for believers to be able  to work out their faith in an intelligent way into their teaching and in their educational  philosophy. So put on your hat, you're asked to come to Teachers College at Columbia and to give  me some advice of changing the design so that you can enhance the educational experience  and of believers who are increasingly appearing at our gates.

You know, I think it's fair to be as suspicious as I think you are about motives here. My, you know Rick Lens, you know who he is, teach the Gordon Conwell, he told, I think  he's probably right about this, he says, because in secular society politics is everything,  because power is everything. Right now, suddenly everybody seems to think, oh, religion is important for getting elected. So we have, I think Catherine told me this just this week, says there's an awful lot  of people are suddenly going to say, we got to figure this out, we got it, we got to figure  this out, we got to understand this, this phenomenon, religion, and especially orthodox religion,  we got to figure it out, figure out what makes it tick, maybe learn how to dismantle it,  maybe weaken it or maybe use it somehow, figure out a way to, and you know, if somebody  comes and says, we want to do a story because we understand you're a Christian school teacher,  and we want to, we're doing a story on Christians who are in the public school, be careful  about all of that for a while, because I'm afraid I don't want to just be a specimen,  that people certainly, I guess maybe all, I guess we are anyway, but I would be careful  about, I'd be careful about what the motivation is, I want to use you to show us how to market  to evangelical Christians. So let's say they're serious and they say, you know, we're not really, you know, a lot  of our students complain or say that they don't really get, really intellectually developed,  because they're inside of them is never done, so what would you suggest?

Yeah, I think I probably would, there's a new book by, you know, what I do, there's a new  book by Nicholas Woolworth's store called Educating for Shalom, even though it's mainly  about, he's taught a Yale for years, he just retired, strong Christian guy, Dutch Calvinist  kind of Kaipirian theologian, and he's written, it's actually a bunch of essays on, it's  mainly Christian education, but he would say for example, Tony, there's the old myth  of the universal that I'm just the human being, you know, I'm not coming from any particular  perspective, I'm just telling you the facts, he says there's a, there's a solid, cystic  kind of particularism where it just says, I have the truth and you don't, I have the Bible  and you're, you're the only, and then he calls what he calls accessible particularism,  which is to say, let's all get out, let's get out on the table, the fact that I, what  we're saying is embedded in various faith narratives and let's talk about it and let's  try to learn from one another and let me, let me, let me, therefore let me actually  give you my Christian approach to economics, brothers and sisters, have you got questions  on the education reform? I'd say question for everybody else, but here, would you like to encourage everyone,  the space that's being created, if anyone has read Thomas Urgeo-Vani, I urge you to look  him up, because the interesting, the tension that's going on in the system as well, there's  this instruction, instruction, instruction, focus, Thomas Urgeo-Vani is one of the most revered  people in the field of education and the board of education pays him to come here, so when  he comes to talk, I was sitting next to an orthodox Jewish colleague of mine and we listened  to his entire speech, which was all of the top brass of the DOE and it was so funny that  everything he outlined was completely about faith-based communities, but talking about  how this is really the way schools as organizations should be, so, but every, oh, that's wonderful. He knows just enough scriptures to put in, actually, in his writing, he does reference  scripture, and so I'm just, I guess I'm curious because with school reform, what's  happening and a lot of the criticism of the academy and things that the chancellor is  doing is that they're trying to take business strategies and just dump it on top of education,  so I guess, and Sergei Ivani was making the claim that schools are more akin to churches  and social organizations, so I guess my question is, what are some of the elements of church  life and other social organizations that we can use to help perform schools as opposed  to what's happening now, which is, you know, if it works in business, the whole Jack Welch  just, you know, drop it on education. Well, you know, I, you were right in picking up, because I started answering a question just  a second ago. Is that, well, I'm not an educator, I don't know what all the tensions are.

I understand why we have a little bit of this problem in the church, for example, when  we examine ministers who are coming in who want to be ordained ministers, the easiest  way to do it is we give this, we give them an enormously, we do this, we're presbyterians. So, you know, you have to master this much doctrine, and we give these very detailed  exams on doctrine, but what you really want to assess is, do they know how to, what's  their bedside manner like? Do they know how to inspire people to want to believe in God and to know Christ and that's  not quantifiable? It's not quantifiable easily. It's much harder to find out whether this is a person who really can be a gospel minister  like that.

I want to, the way I can just systematically just create a, you know, kind of a production  assembly line is tests and scores, and, you know, you got this score on theology, this  score on Bible, this score on church history, this score on this, and hey, they got 97. Again, we all know, of course, that you can get 97% on all the scores and be a terrible  minister, as you all know. So how do you assess it, unfortunately, as soon as you're talking about character and wisdom,  I don't know how to do it, other than to say, you have to, you have to create communities  who evaluate people communally, you know, you have, it's not actually not that hard to  see of a kid is doing better in school, is showing an interest in learning, is relating  well to his classmates, I don't know, can you quantify that a little bit, usually the  grades go up, yeah, you can quantify that, somebody is it completely quantifiable, is  it, maybe, no, it's probably not, so I think probably what you have to do is you have  to, I don't know how this works, but you have to try to argue for letting the schools  do not be quite as test score oriented, that's all I can tell you, I, and that's not  the movement, is it, the movement's all in the other direction. Well, it's kind of what I'm saying is that they state they're speaking both ways, because  it's instruction, instruction, that the money is, you know, spent to bring in people  like Sergi Avani, who are giving exactly the opposite message, who says that, you know, kids  create social capital outside, if you don't allow them to create it in their schools,  then they'll create it on their own, and that's why we have the problems, we have a school  of violence, which you know is, you know, driving a lot of the conversation in the city  with the impact schools, police officers in schools, so it's kind of, you know, but people  that, it's kind of as if we'll be quiet about that, they know where it's working, and  I've had conversations with teachers in here, I see some people out here where their  classrooms work in the middle of absolute chaos, and the reason is because of what we're  talking about, but you're told, well, it's really about the work, so there's kind of this  unspoken, so it's, I guess part of the question too, is how much do you reference the real  reason for it, because my school is turning around, why I have five rules, one of them  is treat others the way you want to be treated, I understand that's not addressing long-term  things that I can't do as a parent, that it's at least establishing, you understand  so, but it's all just as if, keep in the golden rule, you're making it, you're making  explicit, and you're basically judging the kids on the golden rule, but that's not something  to be tested. Right, yeah.

But it ultimately impacts test scores, like, you know, how much do you say, because the  classrooms that are working, when they ask why, and they find out, it's typically a teacher  who's using that philosophy, it's not about the instructional approach that they're using,  so how far do you go and engaging people in that? Well, as far as you can, because don't you think, in some case, your superior will just  take your head off, if you're in other places, it won't, try to put yourself in a place  where you think that there's, as you know, the public, it's like a swimming pool, your  public school system has got hot spots and cold spots, try to get into a hot spot, and  push what you know is the right way. Take questions, right? Okay. I have one.

Oh, we have another one. I'm sorry. Yes. As a Christian administrator, what do you see all roles in terms of how we lead our schools  and as part of a community? You know, many schools, people go in and they come out of the Dan, there's no interaction  with the community, and I think we have a responsibility, and more so as Christian  educate and administrators, and so what do you see all roles?

Yeah. You're right. It's your job to convince the people of that. Here's a suggestion of a book. I guess in the end it looks pretty pessimistic, but I got a lot out of it.

A friend of mine wrote a book called The Death of Character by James Hunter, and it's actually  about moral education. And his basic point, which is kind of hard to argue with, maybe you could get some stuff  out of the book to use on your teachers, is to say communities create character. He says case studies don't do it. He says communities create character where the kids see certain behavior models, and they  see people saying something of the same thing. If the teachers don't talk to each other, each one of you is an independent operator, just  an entrepreneur, you're not a community at all.

And the point is the character is formed by the community. It's not, you can't be formed in a classroom. You can't, you know, you give great case studies. Here's justice. Here's equity.

Here's love. Here's patience. But unless they see equity and love and patience modeled for them, they're not going  to learn it. And they have to see it affirmed and reinforced that way. So if your teachers don't believe it, to the degree, your teachers believe it, and  to the degree you make it a community, to that degree will be an effective school.

I know it's a big fight. You want to have people ask questions? I teach high school in the South Bronx, and luckily everyone in the Bronx knows they  need God, so, or something, so they let me pray for their kids. I don't really have an issue. I teach in public school.

But what do you do when you rejuvenate yourself? Because as a teacher already, I feel like, and you are a teacher, I mean, you come back  with your, right? And you're real strong. I'm a teacher. Right.

Okay. Good. Thank you. An educator, really. Like as an educator, you take this sabbatical, right?

You take this time in the summer, and I want to know, what do you, what parts of you do,  you feel depleted after doing this for many years, because it's finally my second year. And what parts do you know God needs to work in you? Because I feel like this summer, I taught again, I didn't take time off, but I'm feeling  kind of, you know, I'm saying worn down, so what do you do, and have you come about after  a number of years? Yeah. Okay.

Well, I have to, as you prop, some of you, if you're counting, I actually take two months  away from preaching. And what I'm doing for one of those months is I'm actually writing, I decided to try  to pull together a book each year, or if I, I'm not saying I can write a book every  year, but I'm trying, I'm trying to write a book, trying to work on a book for one month. One of the advantages of that is it's, it's actually fairly hard work, but it's not  out with people, it's, it's more research, and I usually get terrific amount of ideas  for my sermons from working on the book. The second thing I do is for one month, I take a whole month off as vacation, but during  that month, I, I probably triple my amount of prayer, like I try to do two or three hours  a day. It sounds like, wow, what a spirit to go, wow, I mean, I'm reading, you know, I'm reading  the Bible and it's not like I'm just sitting there looking, looking at, I don't look at  the clouds for three hours, I, you know, I use the book of common prayer and I, you  know, you know, read meditative letters and sermons and study the Bible and pray.

And I actually, the other thing is, I've got a, probably about 12 people, I don't mean  people, really, like couples, people that I've known for many, many years, are people  that I, that I can relax with, people that I can, can find in, people that I can share  with, what, what I'm facing, and I make sure I get around to them. Actually, I try to take vacations with them if I possibly can. So it's a, it's a, it's a whole month of very intensive people, time and prayer time. And one month of very, actually, fairly intensive, actually, what I like about the week,  the year, what's left month, the month of working on a book is I actually have more time  to work than I can, working on my sermons for the rest of the year because I, you know,  I have so much time every week because I'm busy, I'm out, I'm doing stuff like this. So it's, it's really, like, really in the ivory tower for a month.

And then really out with people and praying for a month. But a change is as good as a rest, by the way, but you do, if I was just preaching, which  I, I used to, I used to, I, what I used to do is I used to go on vacation and people  said, oh, when you're in the, in the memory, would you please preach down here? And I used to do that. And that was not a good idea. You have to let the land, live, follow for a while, otherwise you, it, it pleats and eventually  you can't get any more crumbs out of it.

Okay, that's a little bit. Yes, go ahead. Good evening, bless you, hi, everybody. I've always worked in underserved schools. I started out working in East New York and then I transferred to the South Bronx.

And I did what was called integration transfer, schools that need to be diversified. Well, this September was my first time going to District 2 in Virginia, now I'm just  a 21st and 1st Street, some majority Caucasian and Asian students, there are some Hispanics  and blacks there. But at the other schools, the underserved schools, you had the freedom to teach what you wanted  to teach and use the books you wanted to use. And at this school, everything's very regimented, we have to teach, free the mighty of Mice  and Men. And I'm having a hard time with some of the literature, because, you know, of Mice and Men  there's a lot of expertise in it, and I don't want to meet a lot of the books in class.

I want some suggestions. No, are you saying, are you saying you would like some help with, you know, how to, how  to teach it or you just don't know, you have to read certain books and certain books. You have to read it out loud. I'm comfortable, yes, I'm not comfortable with saying certain, where are the certain  books? Well, I know it's like, I know it's, I know it's, I know it's, I know it's, I know it's  like, it sounds like a sort of a pastor should answer, but I, I'll go out and say, it seems  to me that when you're doing it as a teacher, I mean, the, the, the Christian actors have  asked me something similar and only as worse.

What they say is, okay, I'm a Christian and here I am being called to act and say something  that I, you know, I use exploatives or actually act in a certain way that I don't really  agree with them. I said, well, if you read the Bible, there's a lot of horrible things in the Bible. If there's places in the Bible that talk about some pretty bad things, in fact, there's  a lot of, a lot of the, sometimes you know this because I say this in the, in the services,  the translation sometimes kind of, purify what the Hebrew and the Greek actually are saying. It's telling you the story about how bad things really are. People really talk like this.

People really do these awful things. It's not, you don't want to have to even look at that, but the purpose of the literature  is to bring it out. And so I would say that there's nothing wrong with you saying it out loud because in a  certain sense, you're an actor when you're reading it. You're taking the role. It's not who you really are.

You're getting the book across to the kids. They certainly have heard the exploatives. They live in New York City. But I'm always telling them, you know, I don't swear at them in this case. Yeah.

You're right. No, no, no. Yeah. I think I ought to just say this. I'm doing this for the book, but I don't want to hear anybody talking like this in my hearing  and I don't talk like this.

Okay. Yeah. Okay. On a different note, I'd like to ask you something about exhaustion, just to follow  on from what you were saying. I have a very good summer and I'm totally relaxed and I'm enthusiastic to start the year  and after a week.

It's already, I feel like I'm too tired to do anything and I think one of the difficulties  with teaching is you never get to an end point. There's never a point where you feel, okay, I've done everything I need to do and that's  it and that I can switch off. And the marking keeps coming but it's not even that it's the going through lessons in  my mind and continually not being able to switch off the job and the weekend comes along  and the entire, you know, Sunday is spent doing marking and preparing. So when, for example, the services changed from the 930 to the 1030, I was annoyed because  it meant I got home later and couldn't do as much schoolwork, but I mean, it seems like  I can't get this under control and I've been teaching for 15 years and every year I,  you know, say to myself, I'm going to achieve a balance and it never happens. So I'm just...

What time do you get home? Do you work at night? I'm at school at about quarter to seven every morning and I get home at about seven o'clock  in the evenings. And then the weekends as well. Do you work on things at night?

No. Yeah. Think about this. I was a... I've always been...

I've always tend to overwork and I've always worked probably about 75, 80 hours a week,  all my life as a minister and yet here's... If you think of your... You have seven days unless you think of morning afternoon and evening and admittedly  if your evening starts at seven, it's a little bit of... I mean, that's all right. You still have three hours or so of rooms.

So you have morning... So you have 21 segments, right? Seven days, three times? I wasn't a math major. Math teachers is seven times three times one?

Okay. You have 21 segments. Make sure that you take seven of them off under all circumstances that you're not teaching  and you're not working on lessons seven. Then I have been able to do that. I have to take one day a week off, two days, there's three.

And that means somewhere I have to take one afternoon and one afternoon off and three  other evenings off because I'm out evenings, I work evenings sometimes. If you can take off seven, you can survive. I have for quite a long time in my kids, for some strange reason, do not remember me being  an absentee father, which is still something I don't know how I dodge that bullet. Caddies is where you take those seven if you've got kids. Just make sure and sabbath yourself and also everything is do some reading that has  nothing to do with your job and make sure be disciplined about that and say I'm going  to have at least two or three hours a week reading.

Maybe even every night, an hour, some book that you're working through that has nothing  to do with your job always makes you feel like you've got more of a life. Just a couple ideas. Seven out of 21. Yeah, Rebecca. I actually tell my teachers to go home and I go home and because the thing, this reference  is what we were talking about to be fresh and to have ideas for them and to be emotionally  rested, that's what they're getting in my opinion more out of than the actual lessons  that you're preparing.

So you might not even recognize how you're not able to interact in the situations when  they're high pressure. So you just have to step out and you are not your job. I say that to my teachers, you are Hillary, you are a teacher that you don't become your job  especially as a Christian that's, you have an easier way to ground yourself and say this  is where it ends. And if you get less than thoughts, I know that happens all the time, you know, get up  and write them down and then leave it because it's just not sustainable. And I think you have to remember ultimately what they are getting is the spirit that you're  bringing to it.

And if you're exhausted and you're not replenishing yourself with what's great for you,  the jam or whatever it is, then it's going to show. Anybody else here want to say something about it? You just do not work in the summits. And okay, what your finances are, do not work in the summits. Katherine, can we still take a question or two?

Yeah, go ahead. I was a teaching fellow and for the, that the two years and I was teaching fellow, I  felt like it was a race and I got to my second year and I said, I'm done, I'm going  to leave my school and go for somewhere a little bigger and better. But it was actually, I teach in the Bronx and it's actually the parents that convinced  me to stay at my school. And you know, for all the great reasons. So with that said, Rebecca, you know, used that something about the golden rule, teaching  the golden rule.

I have 26 kindergartners in my Bronx classroom and all we do is teach the golden rule to them  about being loved one another, be kind to one another. But what do you do when these kids go home to these parents who obviously are not communicative  with their teachers who teach the extreme opposite? Because we do really well in the classroom. There's no violence in the classroom. But out on the playground, why did you hit that kid?

Because my mommy told me that if somebody hits me, I hit him back. So this is something that goes beyond the classroom, beyond your role as a teacher. And how do you address this? You can't go to a parent and say, you got to practice the golden rule. So what is a practical approach to these parents?

Teachers. I run parenting workshops. One of the things we did in October 2nd, and Janet was at the piece, what we did was,  we invited parents with a community-based organization, once convention, and we did  a drama workshop, a dance workshop, and a drawing of media workshop. And we did it as a family day, where we called out time with the families we invited the children  with the parents to our school. I think it's an administrative capacity, that you need to go to your administrator and  ask them to think creatively about not having a parent meeting where you're sitting.

In fact, one of the parents said it was at the meeting at the end. We debriefed, and they said to me, this is so refreshing, whenever I went to a parent  meeting before, all the administrator did was bark pieces at me, you know? And my deal is like, I'm not interested in doing things like barking at people. I want them to sit down and actually do activities with their children, and we invited staff  to also do those activities, but I think you need to go to your administrator and say,  I'm having an issue here. Can we brainstorm ways of solving that?

I think you need to do that holistically at different times throughout your community. We have a difficult population in my place. I'm with who have parents who have a lot of the same issues you're saying, and then  high school. By the way, you can do that as a principal, though, because she couldn't do it as a teacher. She could go to a principal.

Okay. Yes, the question. But, I mean, my principal does that. We do Saturday workshops, family workshops, but these parents don't come. They don't come to them.

They don't come to parent-teacher conferences. They don't come when you call them, they don't pick up the phone. And, you know, I want to stay and I want to do this, and I want to work with these parents  who are absent in their kids' school lives. So what can I do as a teacher to go out there and talk to these parents? What, one of the things that worked, and this is the story of my life, I've been in four  hours of meetings today trying to explain some of the same things.

And if you're just very, if you explain it logically, which is, I understand that on the  street, because this is exactly what, I mean, my kids get jumped, they're afraid to confess  who's doing what? Because they get jumped when they leave school. It's very serious. There's bloods members. I mean, I know it's the same story a lot of us have, but the explanation is school.

When you enter the door of school and the yard is school, that is part of your responsibility. What happens at recess? So I have not had a parent yet that doesn't come to the agreement, and I have, I have  had parents write it, put it in writing, I am telling them to hit back just so you know. But once you have a conversation with them, and you can do this as a teacher, which is,  how do I protect your child? If you're telling your child to hit back, and he's telling his child to hit back, and  then everyone's hitting, and when I say to them, I don't want to you serve your authority.

And they always respect that. I don't want to you serve your authority, but I can't protect them. What if it's your child the next time whose parents said the same thing? So when they walk inside the school door, we have to operate differently. And I say to them, I can't tell you what to do on the street.

I understand that's a different issue, but inside the school doors, if you could help us  by saying to the child, give the teachers and the staff the opportunity, give me the opportunity  to keep them safe. Is that what you say? Yes. Okay. Administrators do, you know, villains, even today I understand there were some situations  like that where a parent actually tried to hit another student, and the administrators  have to step in and make the parents realize what would you want us to do for your child?

And I think once you bring it home to the parent, that his child could be the next victim,  then they do step back and really think a little more rationally. It's a bit logical with the process and the follow-up through, they usually come home. Is there great answers? Go ahead. Can you hear me?

One thing is, you know, it's sort of under the current and all conversations with educators  is as your teachers, trying to implement kind of the big picture up above from administration  and from for the public school teachers, the DOE, and I've been a teacher, so I understand  that, but sort of on the other side of the coin, I'm now with the DOE, and I just wanted  to let you all know that it's incredibly encouraging for me to be here tonight. And for what it's worth, there is somebody at the DOE, praying for you all every day. It's probably hard to leave, but... And I will certainly say I would appreciate and we'd all, well, I would appreciate your  prayers as well. And then my quick question for you all is, when I was a teacher and I both worked as  a teacher in the public schools and then worked with the parochial schools in the Bronx  and Manhattan, there were a few moments where I just could really send you a message  that God was sort of showing me that the way I was interacting with the parent or my attitude  in a certain circumstance was totally infused by the grace that he had given me as a Christian  and I'm sorry, I'm a little upset.

And so my question for you all is maybe if you have a little anecdotal story from your  own experiences and educators, if when you just said, like, gosh, I couldn't have handled  that unless I had this world view. I'll begin. We talked about that we prayed, many of us prayed and we said we couldn't start out  day without prayer either reading the Bible or even at school or with others because what  I got to school each day, it's with a sense of adventure because we never know, you know,  you have the best laid plans and everyone is supposed to be in place and then a child  falls and gets cut. We had an anecdote, a kindergarten kid fell in the yard and they thought that she had just  bumped her chin and when she went to the doctor, she had fractured her jaw and her jaw had  to be wired and it was with fear and trembling. How do you speak to that parent when she comes?

What do you say to a parent in that case? How would a parent react? So there was always this prayer and the parent comes in and the administrators there we talked  to the parent and then sometimes they come in very hostile, sometimes they have issues  and they just need someone to talk to and as we speak to them and asking the Holy Spirit  to put the right words and at least in our mouth as we speak, the parents sometimes they  become very calm or that parent may just cry or we need just a hug that we have instances  of children whose parents are dying and they know they are dying and they have issues  of what's going to happen to my child and just a hug and then when that parent leaves  and they feel better or the situation is calm and we say thank God, you know, God is  so good that we say it all the time because we had no thought or no plan of how we would  face that situation so it happens I think almost daily at my school. Just going back to the parent issue that June brought up a few minutes ago, it just happened  actually before I got here and I said I spent a lot of time investigating the game related  incident and I actually school safety had to walk out to parents today because they were  so enraged over the conversation and I guess to be honest like one of your first tendencies  would be while I wasn't able to complete the investigation because you had to be escorted  out because of your behavior so maybe I'll just go ahead and record it as this did happen  without getting to the bottom of it but I persisted for another rest of the day and I called  the parent back on the phone which was really not what I thought I should probably do before  coming here and trying to be positive after the way the last meeting went but I told her  the status of the investigation and that her son actually had not been one of the parties  that had participated in the in the occurrence and she said, Ms. Marlon, I felt so bad all  day I just wanted to apologize to you and so I just knew that in that like the fact  of just being able to call her back it was not it was just the grace of God just giving  me that after it had been you know two or three people walking out and I know that was  just totally grace.

You're trying to re-weave something that you can tell needs to be related  these things need to be related to each other and they're not and it's very very very frustrated  but you're Christians and you know what that means that means that you eventually the things you  want to see happen are going to happen there will eventually be peace there will eventually be  justice there will eventually be whole families there will eventually you won't have parents dying  you're going to have a re-woven creation God is going to do it I mean there's a lot of jobs  that are more satisfying than your job because you're making something and you make it  well and then you send it out there and people buy it you make your money you go home your  product are change lives and maturity and wisdom and therefore you're always unhappy with your  product I mean it's just never what you want it to be it's very very frustrating but your  Christians it's you're not fighting a losing battle at all everything sad is going to come on  true someday so you're on the right side and you've got to live in that kind of hope now let's pray  Father we thank you that you have called us in this room to be educators and that you've called  us into a job that it seems so messy it's not like producing a piece of machinery and it's selling  it it's not like so many other jobs in which the product is a quantifiable and the bottom line  is so much easier to to grasp and to drive and to recognize we're talking about change lies we're  talking about learning wisdom we're talking about maturity we're talking about people becoming  real human beings and it seems like an endless maybe losing cause but it's not we know it's not  because of Christians and we thank you for all the ways in which the men and women in this room  are your agents for healing in the world and repairing and reweaving your creation thank you that  the resurrected Jesus proves to us that someday you will completely you will fulfill our deepest  desires to see our city hole in this family's hole so thank you for this time and continue to be our  great teacher Jesus Christ and his name we pray. Amen.

当你注册时，你将收到我们的季度期刊和其他宝贵的以福音为中心的资源。今天就在GospelandLife.com订阅吧。是的，我实际上曾是一名真正的正式教师，在神学院研究生院任教五年，实际上讲课，我创建考试，批改考试和论文，持续了五年。我说，让我回到事工中去，在那里你可以教导，没有人知道人们是否在学习。这太棒了。

没有办法知道。看起来是这样，所以，这消除了所有的压力。让我，让，好的，好的。让我建议，C.S.刘易斯唯一一本关于公共教育的书，这就是这本书所讨论的，《人的废除》，小书，短书，那种每个人都想要的书。让我从这本书中分享两个想法。

如果你是一名教师，从未读过它，或者如果你很久没有读过它，我建议你读一读，因为它是关于教育的。第一篇文章叫做《无胸之人》，非常著名，在其中，他引用了当时写的一本书，我想是在1940年代，一本据说是高中生英国文学教科书的书，我们称之为高中。在书中，有这样一段伟大的引文，刘易斯引用了它。他说，教科书说，当人们说一个瀑布是崇高的时候，他们认为他们在说关于瀑布非常重要的事情，但他们只是在说关于他们对瀑布的感受。刘易斯指出，这正是现代的本质，这是现代性的本质。

这是现代西方文化的本质。他们所说的是，如果你谈论一个客观事实，可以被证明的东西，可以实证研究的东西，那是一个事实。但如果你说任何不能被实证证明的东西，如果你说通奸是罪，或者我相信上帝，或者瀑布是崇高的，你只是在谈论感受。这是主观的。这并不真正重要，大卫说。

刘易斯指出，这是本质，如果你是公立学校教师，这是你问题的本质。你被允许谈论，据说，你被允许谈论任何主观的、实证证明的、可以理性研究的东西。但当涉及道德价值观、宗教信仰时，我相信上帝，我认为通奸是错误的。每当你涉及任何不能被证明的东西时，那是主观的。那应该保持私密。

你不被允许谈论那个。这当然是一个大热点问题，但在政治中，我可以把我的道德观点带入公共领域吗？有些人说，不，当然不行。你不要把你的宗教或道德观点带入公共场合，带入政治。在那里我们只谈论什么是合理和理性的，而不是你认为的你的道德价值观。

刘易斯回应说，如果你真的相信一切都是相对的，当涉及道德时，他有一个非常著名的地方，他说，他说，如果你真的以这种方式教育学生，如果你真的教育学生相信，客观的、事实的东西是一回事。但所有的道德观点，所有关于道德、宗教或类似事物的观点都是完全主观的，完全应该保持私密。完全相对，也就是说，相对于你的个人意识或你所在的文化。他说，你意识到会发生什么，这是结束那篇文章的引文。他说，你几乎打不开一份期刊而不遇到这样的陈述：我们的文明需要动力或更多的自我牺牲。

在一种可怕的简单性中，我们移除器官并要求功能。我们造出无胸之人，却期待他们有美德和进取心。我们嘲笑荣誉，却对在我们中间发现叛徒感到震惊。我们阉割，却要求被阉者繁殖。他真正要说的是，如果你真的说一切都是相对的，除了那些可以实证证明的东西，自我牺牲，为什么要自我牺牲？

为什么关心公共利益？为什么做一个好公民？为什么？他说，你不能那样教育人们。那么答案是什么？

他实际上提出了一种叫做"道"的东西。他所说的道，T-A-O，是从中国的观念中借用的，即存在一种自然法则。他说他相信，几乎所有宗教都相信，尽管宗教在许多事情上不同，比如你如何得救。所有人类对上帝和对错都有一些基本的理解，我们多少直觉地知道。刘易斯论证说，在此基础上，天主教徒称之为自然法，新教徒称之为普遍恩典。

基于人们直觉地知道某些东西的事实，你可以进行教育，你可以基于这种理解即存在普遍恩典来诉求。那么，我是什么意思？对于那些在基督教学校或私立学校以及公立学校的人来说，这实际上非常重要。顺便说一句，我在这里给你一个更新教的自然法、普遍恩典的观点。新教的观点是，如果你对罪有一个薄弱的理解，即只是违反某些规则，你应该让它更强健，根据圣经对罪的厚重、强健的理解，对罪的厚重、强健的看法是，罪是使任何东西比上帝更中心。

罪是偶像崇拜。所以民族主义、使你的家庭或使你的道德记录或使教义纯洁成为使我们比其他人更好的东西。这些都是偶像崇拜和自以为义的形式，但当然物质主义、性、权力、侵略性暴力。它们都是偶像。所以对罪的强健理解不仅仅是你违反规则，因为你知道，法利赛人是可怕的罪人，因为他们非常自以为义，充满骄傲，是可怕的人，尽管他们遵守所有规则。

其次，如果你想理解自然法和普遍恩典，你必须对恩典有一个厚重的理解。这是我所说的对恩典的厚重理解的意思。你需要理解在罗马书第1章第18至25节中，我们读到这个。我能找到它。它说是的。

罗马书1章25节说，自从创世以来，上帝的无形品质已经清楚地被看见，从所造之物中被理解，所以人无可推诿。现在这句话是说所有人基本上知道黄金法则，基本上知道我们不能自私，基本上知道我们应该照顾我们的家庭，基本上知道对错，但他们压制它。但有趣的是，动词是被理解、被看见，是现在被动分词。这意味着在任何给定的时间，地球上每一个人在他们的内心深处都在经历一场对话，在他们对上帝的了解和他们对对错的了解与他们自己的偶像崇拜的心之间。所以每一个文化产品，每一首诗，每一件艺术品，每一篇文章，每一篇专栏文章，所有曾经产生的东西都是那场对话的结果，这意味着如果你，如果我是基督徒，我正在生产一个文化产品，顺便说一句，那就是讲道，其中有偶像崇拜，其中有错误，其中有偶像崇拜的话语。

我在某种程度上，我从来没有完全正确地击中它，我可能对我自己的长老会主义感到骄傲，我可能在我说话的方式上缺乏谦卑。我的意思是，换句话说，我所说的既有真理也有偶像崇拜。但在非基督徒中，根据罗马书第1章，那些甚至公开说他们不相信上帝的人，当他们制作电影时，当他们制作电影和艺术时，当他们写文章时，其中总是有一些对上帝真理的见证。它显示非基督徒一直在说好的东西，因为普遍恩典。C.S.刘易斯说，你必须理解普遍恩典，如果你要教育，你必须对罪有一个强健的看法，对恩典有一个强健的看法，原因如下。

如果是这样，这是为什么当我被问到这个问题时，我很难相信基督教教育、基督教学校或公共教育、公立学校中的基督徒是，我很难相信这两者中的任何一个是唯一的道路。我很难相信那是教育人的唯一方式。在我看来，如果你在基督教学校，我确实有，正如你将在一分钟内听到的，我的孩子到处都去过，这显示了缺乏纪律或缺乏连贯的哲学，或者也许我有其他原因，但我不难看到，当我把我的孩子送到基督教学校时，他们经常带着一些学习圣经的方式出来。你可以看到偶像崇拜的话语，你可以看到僵化，我永远不会忘记我的一年级儿子从他在弗吉尼亚霍普的基督教学校回家，他说，我们今天在为公立学校的孩子们祈祷，为什么？因为他们不能祈祷，他们的信仰一直受到攻击，这是一年级学生。

虽然其中有一些偶像崇拜的话语，好吧，就是这样。另一方面，在公立学校，如果你是基督徒，你将不得不通过诉诸自然法和普遍恩典来教育，而不是引用圣经。你必须期待，首先，非信徒或其他宗教信徒的人将对真理有一些理解，你知道，举一个真实的例子，明显的例子，强奸。几乎每个人都认为强奸是错误的，为什么？你能科学地证明它吗？

绝对不能。它是理性的吗，嗯，它是实用的，但没有理性或实证的方法来证明强奸是错误的。为什么我们都认为强奸是错误的？为什么它被载入我们的立法？为什么我们可以在公立学校教室里说，强奸是错误的？

你意识到那是一个价值观吗？那是一个信仰宣言。那是我们相信是错误的东西，但我们永远无法证明，但普遍恩典和自然启示，几乎无论我们是谁，我们都直觉地知道它。现在你必须做的是你必须找到那些其他地方，你必须基于自然法和普遍恩典来推理，最后，只是在这里编码，要意识到的重要事情之一是越来越多，尽管我需要你们中的一些人会说，我看不到，好吧，但我看到了。公立学校或实际上我们的公共机构越来越难以继续维持事实和价值之间的这种区别。

越来越多的人认识到你所说的一切都基于信仰假设，就像我刚才给你举的强奸的例子。当有人说，我们都知道强奸是错误的，我们为什么知道强奸是错误的？那是一种信仰行为。那是一种道德判断。当有人说，你不能把你的道德判断带入课堂时，你必须意识到每个人都在这样做。

每个人都在说，基于我对现实本质的理解，基于我认为我们都在其中的故事的理解，有一个个人主义启蒙运动的故事，它说除了人权之外真的没有真理，我们也应该自由地决定什么对我们来说是正确的，但那是一个故事。那是一种理解所有现实的方式，它是一种世界观，它是一种信仰的东西，你无法证明它。如果你是一名基督教教师，无论你是在私立学校还是基督教学校，还是在公立学校的基督教学校，展示给你的学生看，实际上每一个陈述都嵌入在一个道德的世界观中，并且你必须将其识别为这样，这将越来越重要和可能。所以你知道，你说马丁·路德·金为民权工作，因为他为什么这样做？他说，一切都是相对的，每个人都必须决定什么对他们来说是正确的吗？

他说，因为圣经这样说，他确实这样做了，他说，让公义如大水滚滚。他是一位非裔美国新教徒，在他的理解中，原因是，你知道，我想黑人活动家进入公民不服从的原因，与他们的白人自由派朋友在1950年代所说的相反，是他们的白人自由派朋友是人文主义者，不相信人是有罪的。但读过赖因霍尔德·尼布尔和圣经的黑人活动家知道人是有罪的，他们知道美国人，白人美国人不会放弃权力除非被推动，他们想以仍然是基督教和充满爱的方式做到这一点，所以他们进行了公民不服从，和平的公民不服从。你必须表明马丁·路德·金所做的来自对人性、对上帝和对错的特定理解，因为每个说任何话的人，甚至那些相信人权的人，那来自对生活是什么样的启蒙观点。越来越多，你将能够，你将不得不告诉人们这些故事，让你的学生认识到每一个道德主张，任何种类的主张如何嵌入在一个世界观中。

你必须能够说，越来越多，顶层的人，哲学家知道没有所谓的理性只是不嵌入在对终极现实的特定理解中，越来越多，你也将能够做到这一点。所以基于普遍恩典，基于对事物的这种理解，我实际上认为这意味着我们这些在基督教教育中的人，像我一样，必须认识到我们基督教教育的有限性。你们那些在公共教育中的基督徒必须意识到，我认为，在指导人们智慧方面的真正可能性，也许在公开谈论各种信仰观点方面日益增加的可能性。所以现在，我说这个是因为我猜测当我现在得到这些问题时，我会倾向于参考这个来自《人的废除》的基本洞察。好吗？

所以我应该在接下来的45分钟内领导。嗯，我应该回答问题，我认为这意味着小组讨论。首先，你应该向我提问关于什么样的学校，私立、公立、基督教、家庭教育，不是吗，凯瑟琳？让我们试试，让我们向我提关于这方面的问题一段时间，我会试着给出答案，你可以回应，然后我会开始。我认为当我们谈论选择和哲学时，真正归结到的是我们如何生活，我们把孩子放在哪里，我们选择住在哪里。

所以我从与你的长期关系中知道，实际上，你最小的儿子去了布朗克斯科学中学，他有一个数学家教，他是我当时经营的基督教学校的老师。对的，我的大儿子一直上公立学校。一直到底。纽约公立学校。纽约公立学校。

但我确定你把你的其他孩子送去了基督教寄宿学校。我的中间儿子去了公立学校直到九年级，我把他送到石溪，这是一个基督教寄宿学校，距离一个半小时。我最小的儿子乔纳森，我想，上公立学校到四年级，从五年级到八年级去了一所天主教学校，所以我真的很多样化，顺便说一句。然后去了，然后他也去了石溪，基督教寄宿学校。第一，我是认真的。我妻子，我谈论过，在我来之前确保我妻子和我在这个问题上仍然达成一致。

是的，我们确实看到各种形式教育的优势。我们不，我会很失望如果基督徒不积极地进入每一种教育，私立、基督教、私立和公立。我认为我们可以在每一种教育中做大量的好事和更新。这就是为什么，因为我对任何一种都没有哲学问题，我们可以自由选择我们认为适合孩子的那种。我们对基督教教育没有问题，对公共教育也没有问题，因此我们能够做出选择。

如果他进入了汤森哈里斯，我们可能会让他留在这里。他试图进入汤森哈里斯，但事后看来，我们真的做出了正确的选择，因为他会住在家里，这对他来说不是最好的事情。乔纳森也坚持他不想去石溪。当我们回顾时，我们仍然不确定这是不是最好的主意，但这也是...我们认为这没问题，所以他这样做了，因为他真的、真的想要。这是，顺便说一句，你们那些既是家长又是教师的人知道，这就是你如何做这件事的。

你是根据个案来做的。现在，如果我们认为公立学校不好，或者基督教学校，不，不，不，这些都不行，我们就不会有所有这些选择，但我们有。事实上，顺便说一句，我的妹妹，我深爱的妹妹，我爱死她了，是我认识的最好的家庭教育者。她在家教育。信不信由你，很多人。

你说，嗯，不仅她的五个孩子，而且我想还有邻居的所有其他孩子。这是...所以我已经转了一圈。我们今天会对...我会说同样的话，只是对那些作为基督徒的父母说，你确实有很多选择，你真的应该根据个案来做，我实际上希望基督徒能够以某种方式分布良好。我确实认为在这个城市我们实际上需要比我们现有的更多的基督教学校。

我也认为我们需要基督徒更积极地参与公立学校和公立学校的更新。我希望千花齐放。我真的认为这真的是可能的。我想因为我们很多人...很难...如果你作为教师在公立学校，我希望你会觉得这是...你觉得你的方法是更优越的那种没有错。如果你不觉得有点...

我的意思是，我喜欢...有这种真正奇怪的张力。我想要感觉...我想要我员工上的每个人都觉得没有像救赎主这样的教会。你知道，你必须觉得这是最伟大的教会。你必须小心这一点，因为这更多是情感上的而不是智力上的。

你退后一步。你必须说不，等一下。还有很多其他伟大的教会。所以如果你在公立...如果你想为这个城市创建伟大的基督教学校，你定义了它，你真的想要做到这一点，你有激情去感觉，这是我的激情，这是我想做的，这对你来说是可以的。并且感觉...

我想尽可能多地招募人们加入，反之亦然，公立学校也是如此。所以这就是为什么我...我们必须根据个案来做。好的，其他问题？我只是想给一点背景。我不是基督教和公立学校的产物，所以我认为不仅适合...适合孩子，而且在孩子生活的不同时期，所以我想你知道，这非常重要。

我也只是想就我为什么坐在这里作为一名管理人员说一点，这是直接的结果，凯瑟琳提到我在领导力学院。我在领导力学院的原因，长话短说，是来自校长克莱因对我工作的东弗拉特布什一所学校的现场访问的一次对话，那是一所失败的学校，我在那里教书，我迫不及待地等他到达，告诉他一切错误的地方，并谈论，你怎么能让孩子们生活在这些条件下？所以无论如何，出于那次对话，他说，嗯，你怎么让学生读书的？他们的哥哥姐姐甚至不会读书。那么你做了这个吗？

你做了那个吗？是你去研究生院的地方吗？是那个吗？我说，实际上，这是关于为我们创造一个有爱心的社区。所以每天在我的教室里，我从早会开始，我们谈论以我们想要被对待的方式对待彼此意味着什么。

我经历了这整件事，期待他，你知道，逃跑，因为那与他们在统一课程方面推动的改革努力无关。实际上，他的回应是他听了大约30分钟，他说，你能把所有这些都发给我邮件吗？我想，嗯，你知道，那只是某种，你知道，让我感觉良好。她给了我所有这些垃圾或什么的。但谈话继续进行了吗？

他说，事实上，我真的需要你申请这个项目。我说，哪个项目？他说，领导力学院，你知道，对它一无所知。我说，哦，不，我想当老师。我对管理没有兴趣。

他说，我知道，这正是为什么我需要你在那里。所以我最终发给他的是一份政策备忘录，基本上题为用黄金法则改变纽约市学校。毫无疑问，这是我带给领导力学院的声音，也是我试图带给这所学校的声音。所以我只想说，这是非常真实的，有很多机会。我们在公共教育中陷入如此危机，老实说，我会告诉你。

只要它有效，他们真的不在乎你说它来自哪里。所以与此同时的是质量。你不能到处说我是基督徒，我是基督徒，然而你在做不合格的工作，这往往成为一个拐杖。所以我只想再次强调，这是，你知道，不谈论政治。有一个公开的机会来影响学校。

这是我问题的背景，我同意蒂姆。我确实有一个问题，那就是今天基督教中最响亮的声音似乎是反对公立学校和反对让基督徒学生上公立学校的人。我确实相信每个孩子有不同的环境。但我只想读一份声明，它引发了我整个担忧。这是雷·摩尔先生的，他经营着一个叫做出埃及任务的组织，他们要求所有基督徒从公立学校撤出他们的学生。引文是，一场从公立学校中清除基督徒孩子的运动将真正地电化和激发教会，这是现代没有任何事情做过的。

并可能触发我们都如此期待的复兴。所以那个，那个实际上得到了肯尼迪的詹姆斯·多布森博士的支持。

所以这就是在流传的东西。我，你知道，也许不是在这里，但在国家的其他地方。所以我想我的问题是，我也在与摩尔先生的电子邮件对话中问过这个问题，特别是在像这样处于危机中的城市。我们都可以承认危机情况。

作为基督徒，我们对公立学校的学生有什么责任？我们可以用什么方式共同努力来弥合家庭教育、私立学校、基督教学校之间的这种分歧，就像在教会中一样，你知道，所以我不知道这是不是一个问题。不，它是。让我，我会说一些话。我想确保斯科特或某人问我一个关于基督教学校的问题，如果可以的话，我的意思是，所以我，所以另一只鞋掉下来。但让我只是说一些关于，嗯，不，这里。我们应该只是种植新教会吗？还是我们应该更新城市中存在的教会？现在，自从我是一名教会开拓者以来，我已经对此进行了很多思考。

当你种植一个新教会时，很容易给人这样的印象，或者甚至相信这里所有其他教会都死了，这根本行不通。所以我们必须建立一个真正着火的新教会。现在，事实是一个城市不会仅仅通过新教会为基督而到达。有大量大量的人会去现有的教会，只会去现有的教会。较老的教会，教会，你知道，他们的父母和祖父母所在的教会，只会读到。这是很多人将被现有教会、已建立的教会、较老的教会所接触的唯一方式。同样真实的是，除非你建立新教会，否则较老的教会有时不会被刺激去做出改变。当救赎主开始时，我们真的发现了这一点。我们开始做很多其他教会在城镇里永远不会奏效的事情。它在救赎主确实奏效了。

接下来你知道，他们开始在较老的教会里做这件事。因此，实际上需要像基督教学校运动这样的东西，毫无疑问，有很多公立学校系统之外的学校可以做公立学校系统可以学习的事情。你必须有那样的更新，但你也必须更新公立学校。你就是不能放弃所有公立学校的学生。所以我知道到达一个城市的方法不仅是种植新教会，而且要更新旧教会。根本不是其他任何战争。多年来，有一些教会开拓者就像这份请愿书或这项运动中的人一样。他们真的在说，现有的教会只是一大堆废话，它会下地狱。我们只是忘记它，每个人都应该出来加入我们，因为我们是真正的新教会。它从来不奏效。

它造成摩擦、宗派主义，所以你必须两者都有，就这么简单。我真的相信对于那些小心的基督徒来说，会有越来越多的开放。不要成为宗派主义者，理解普遍恩典和自然法。我们将能够在公共场合谈论我们所说的信仰基础，因为你必须说，每个人都有一个。

所以，当你来说这个时，看，那是一个信仰，那有一个信仰基础。你必须向每个人解释，所以这样做的原因是，让我完成这一个。阿拉斯代尔·麦金太尔在1984年写了一本书叫《德性之后》。它对思想生活，特别是哲学世界产生了巨大影响。他说，你永远不能谈论某事是好的，除非你问，回答这个问题，它是为了什么？

所以，他可能听过我用这个例证。你不能说它是否是一块好手表，除非你问，它是为了什么？它用来敲钉子很糟糕，顺便说一句，如果你试过。但它用来计时很棒。所以问题是，它是一块好手表还是一块坏手表？

这完全取决于它是为什么而建的，它是为了什么？当你开始说，这是一个好人吗？这是一个好人吗？你不能回答这个问题，除非你问，人类是为了什么？他们意味着什么？

人类生活的意义是什么？我们为什么在这里？什么是重要的东西？你不能从科学中回答那个问题。你不能。

有印度教的答案，有佛教的答案，有个人主义启蒙运动的答案，有世俗的答案，有基督教的答案，有犹太人的答案，任何说这是好行为、这是坏行为的人，都将其嵌入在一个特定的世界观、一套信仰假设中。没有任何人可以，如果你说，在任何公共场合，没有人知道如何再次获得视线。因为某种客观的、中立的、从无处而来的观点的启蒙观念已经消失了，每个人都反对理解这一点。因此，即使在公共教育中，我们作为基督徒也必须有一种方式说，这是基督教的事物如何运作的，这是犹太教的事物如何运作的，这是印度教的事物如何运作的，并与我们的学生谈论它。基督教，每当它被比较时，总是看起来相当不错。

它有很多伟大的实践者，比如马丁·路德·金，例如，如果你被允许让他成为他真正的样子，那就是福音的牧师。有，我们有很多非常伟大的例子，你可以，我发现在某种程度上，如果你在一个更福音派的教会，你总是与非基督徒一起工作，你总是对此感到兴奋，但你想，我希望我在一个没有那么多流动性的教会，那里的人年复一年都在那里，我可以进行门徒训练。换句话说，我在弗吉尼亚有一个教会，那里没有人离开，也没有人来，我有很多，我能够做很多门徒训练和深入钻研神学教育，但我，我对传福音和外展有激情。如果你在公共教育，或者如果你在基督教教育，你会发现，一般来说，你会完成不同的事情。你会发现一个能让你更多地谈论、接触人们的，但你总是觉得，我的手在某种程度上被束缚了，我不能完全深入到我想去的地方，在基督教教育中，有时你会觉得它有点像温室。

所以我只是不知道哪一个是理想的，我认为我们必须两者都有，任何给人这样印象的人，即每个人都从公立学校出来，想去基督教学校，那将是错误的。因为我今年在做箴言这件事，我现在可能理解学校的目标会是什么，那就是智慧，这是帮助孩子理解生活如何运作，人心如何运作，以便他们知道如何做出正确的选择，即使在道德规则不适用的领域，那将是，我认为有趣的是，这可能是公立学校教师（他们是基督徒）和基督教学校教师都可以尝试做的事情，他们会稍微不同地变坏。说了这些，斯科特，你想问你的问题吗？实际上，我想，谢谢。由于学校还不会阅读，而且据我理解，它们仍然对信仰充满敌意，为什么父母应该把他们的孩子交给一个如此充满敌意的学校系统，特别是考虑到即使孩子在基督教家庭中成长，了解福音，也许，或者接受的基督，他们的信仰仍在形成，还不够有弹性，他们不能独立站立。

为什么父母会把他们的孩子交给这样一个机构，而他们撤销那种灌输的机会仍然有限？我认为那是，因为我不相信中立性，我不相信有这样的事情，正如我刚才说的，因此我对把我的孩子送到基督教学校的想法有很多同情，我的孩子在基督教学校受益于它，这样说吧。我在纽约发现，真正反基督教的学校是私立学校。换句话说，巴克利和查平，不是布朗克斯科学中学或史岱文森。我认为公平地对待非基督教学校，我们需要做出这种区分。

我看到了巨大的差异，现在我发现郊区的公立学校经常，在他们的思维中，你要么有世俗的人，要么有基督徒，这些疯狂的疯子基督徒。在这个城市，公立学校教师正在处理印度教徒、穆斯林、佛教徒、犹太人、基督徒、东正教基督徒和天主教基督徒，我发现他们非常小心，令人难以置信地尊重。例如，每年，在罗斯福岛小学，我被要求与一位拉比和一位神父一起进来，我们进来，我们谈论圣日，因为那位犹太教师公立学校教师教我所有的孩子都经历过，她说，看，我真的希望他们理解这些不同的观点，她说，我甚至试图确保我不让他们认为我相信它们都是相对的。尽管她是世俗的，但她说，我意识到在某种意义上，她理解，如果我只是说，嗯，有这种观点和那种观点，这不是很美妙吗？每个人都有自己的宗教，它们都同样有效。

即使说那也实际上是一种极权主义的观点。就是这样。尽管她永远不能说那是一种启蒙观点，但她理解，在某种程度上，那是把世俗主义置于其他宗教之上。我想在某种程度上，她很害怕，她害怕一些愤怒的印度教徒、穆斯林或基督徒家长进来尖叫。我想在纽约，每个人都尖叫，所以我发现公立学校对不同宗教非常尊重，并不那么充满敌意。

似乎甚至有一种直觉的理解，即使世俗主义也不能被强加给这些孩子，否则他们的父母会拿走他们老师的脑袋。我想让你知道，当涉及到这个城市的一些所谓的精英私立学校时，很多人想把他们的孩子送到那里，它们公开地充满敌意。我不是在开玩笑。他们乐于拆除任何传统的权威或道德理解。因此，我认为你应该做出区分。

这是第一件事。其次，我很高兴我的孩子，我认为那两个既在公立学校又在基督教学校的可能受益了。我认为如果他们一直在基督教学校或一直在公立学校，我看到了一些优势。所以我不知道这告诉你什么，我只是一个摇摆不定的查理布朗式的人。但我认为你必须非常仔细地观察，因为我认为斯科特的问题是对的。

如果你，我正在与父母交谈，我会说你真的需要知道你的学区或你当地的学校有多敌意，或者老师的观点是什么样的，因为你真的没有权利抛弃我。圣经，申命记第6章说，父母，你们对孩子的养育负有责任。当我不能把那个委派出去，我的意思是我可以把教学的日复一日的实际工作委派给其他人，但我不能把责任委派出去。据估计，我们大多数人在工作上花费了一半的清醒时间。圣经的智慧如何应用于我们的职业？

换句话说，我们的工作如何与上帝的工作联系，我们的职业如何更加有情感？在他的书《每一项美好的努力》中，提姆·凯勒从数十年关于职业和呼召的教导中汲取灵感，向你展示如何在你服事上帝和他人时在你的工作中找到真正的喜乐。这本书提供了令人惊讶的洞察，了解基督教对工作的看法如何能成为蓬勃发展的职业和平衡的个人生活的基础。《每一项美好的努力》是我们对你的礼物的感谢，以帮助福音与生命与世界各地更多的人分享基督的爱。访问gospel and life dot com slash give，那就是gospel and life dot com slash give。

我最近在阅读《纽约时报杂志》时注意到的一件事，我确信托尼作为记者也注意到了这一点，越来越多的记者在撰写关于热门话题的文章时，不再像他们是全知、客观、全能、无所不在的叙述者那样行事，而是在声明他们自己的立场在哪里。有趣的是这篇关于市场中信仰的文章，它是上周日《纽约时报杂志》的封面故事。记者做得很好，他出来说，完全披露，这是我的观点。这是我的宗教观点。尽管如此，我会说这个，我会试图真正公正，认识到这里的优势。

我认为这越来越可能。你必须，我知道会有某些，你必须注意某些老师和某些其他家长。所以我会非常小心，但我打赌越来越多，如果你说，嗯，这是我来自的地方，我们都来自某个地方，我只是想在完全披露的利益下，你知道这是我的观点，但我真的可以欣赏你的。现在，我认为因此这是可能的。我认为即使10年前你也不能那样做，但我认为越来越多的人会认识到我们都嵌入在道德社区中，我们都嵌入在信仰社区中，甚至世俗的人也是一种信仰。

重要的不是你是否做出真理主张，而是你如何对待有不同观点的人？我认为你必须说，这不是我是否相信这个或它如何的问题，而是我如何对待其他人，我想表明我真的尊重，我也希望你帮助我理解你的观点，也许这会改变我看待事物的一些方式。所以我认为你可以更开放。但我害怕，小心，你知道，不要说，哦，提姆·凯勒说，然后你回去，下次你有家长面谈时，你说，顺便说一句，我是一名重生的基督徒。但它需要与主题相关。

你不只是说，我想让你知道，蒂姆，我的牧师告诉我，我可以做这个，它需要与主题相关，但如果与说些什么有关，那并不坏。其他人。我在竞选期间做了很多关于宗教问题的民意调查，这个城市的某些受尊敬的新闻机构实际上不太感兴趣，直到大约周二晚上7点，我的邮箱充满了联系。我们一直在做的，某种程度上打开了一个垂死的辩解，对不起，我们没有发表任何东西，你写了，但现在我们永远不会想到，但所以你确实得到了变化，但我做的，一个弱点是，如果我们处于这样的位置，那就是在教师的研究生和本科教育中，我们实际上并没有为信徒提供太多工具，使他们能够以一种智能的方式将他们的信仰体现到他们的教学和教育哲学中。所以戴上你的帽子，你被要求来到哥伦比亚大学教师学院，给我一些改变设计的建议，以便你可以增强信徒的教育体验，他们越来越多地出现在我们的大门口。

你知道，我认为对你对这里动机的怀疑是公平的。我的，你知道瑞克·伦斯，你知道他是谁，在戈登康威尔教书，他告诉，我想他关于这一点可能是对的，他说，因为在世俗社会中政治就是一切，因为权力就是一切。现在，突然每个人似乎都认为，哦，宗教对于当选很重要。所以我们有，我想凯瑟琳本周告诉我这件事，说有很多人突然会说，我们必须弄清楚这一点，我们必须弄清楚这一点，我们必须理解这种现象，宗教，特别是正统宗教，我们必须弄清楚它，弄清楚它是什么让它运作，也许学会如何拆除它，也许削弱它或者也许以某种方式使用它，弄清楚一种方法，你知道，如果有人来说，我们想做一个故事，因为我们理解你是一名基督教学校教师，我们想，我们正在做一个关于在公立学校的基督徒的故事，暂时要小心所有这些，因为我害怕我不想只是成为一个标本，人们当然，我想也许所有，我想我们无论如何都是，但我会小心，我会小心动机是什么，我想用你来向我们展示如何向福音派基督徒推销。所以假设他们是认真的，他们说，你知道，我们不是真的，你知道，我们的很多学生抱怨或说他们没有真正得到，真正智力发展，因为他们内心的从未完成，所以你会建议什么？

是的，我想我可能会，你知道，尼古拉斯·沃尔特斯托夫有一本新书叫《为沙洛姆而教育》，尽管它主要是关于，他在耶鲁教了很多年，他刚刚退休，坚强的基督徒，荷兰加尔文主义者，凯波式神学家，他写了，这实际上是一堆关于的文章，主要是基督教教育，但他会说，例如，托尼，有一个旧的普遍性神话，我只是人类，你知道，我不是来自任何特定的观点，我只是告诉你事实，他说有一个，有一种坚实的、包裹性的特殊主义，它只是说，我有真理，你没有，我有圣经，你，你是唯一的，然后他称之为可接近的特殊主义，也就是说，让我们都出来，让我们把这个事实摆在桌面上，我，我们所说的嵌入在各种信仰叙事中，让我们谈论它，让我们试着相互学习，让我，让我，让我，因此让我实际上给你我对经济学的基督教方法，弟兄姐妹们，你们对教育改革有问题吗？我会对其他所有人说问题，但在这里，你想鼓励每个人，正在创造的空间，如果有人读过托马斯·塞尔吉奥瓦尼，我敦促你去查找他，因为有趣的，系统中也在进行的紧张局势，有这种教学、教学、教学的重点，托马斯·塞尔吉奥瓦尼是教育领域最受尊敬的人之一，教育委员会付钱让他来这里，所以当他来讲话时，我坐在我的一位正统犹太教同事旁边，我们听了他的整个演讲，那是教育部的所有高层人员，非常有趣的是，他概述的一切完全是关于基于信仰的社区，但谈论这实际上是学校作为组织应该的方式，所以，但每个，哦，那太棒了。他知道足够的经文来放入，实际上，在他的写作中，他确实引用了经文，所以我只是，我想我很好奇，因为随着学校改革，正在发生的事情以及对学院和校长正在做的事情的很多批评是，他们试图采取商业策略，只是把它倾倒在教育之上，所以我想，塞尔吉奥瓦尼正在声称学校更类似于教会和社会组织，所以我想我的问题是，我们可以使用教会生活和其他社会组织的哪些元素来帮助表演学校，而不是现在正在发生的，你知道，如果它在商业中有效，整个杰克·韦尔奇只是，你知道，把它放在教育上。嗯，你知道，我，你在挑选时是对的，因为我一秒钟前开始回答一个问题。那是，嗯，我不是教育家，我不知道所有的紧张局势是什么。

我理解为什么我们在教会中有这个问题的一点，例如，当我们审查想要成为受按立牧师的进来的牧师时，最简单的方法是我们给这个，我们给他们一个巨大的，我们这样做，我们是长老会。所以，你知道，你必须掌握这么多教义，我们在教义上给这些非常详细的考试，但你真正想要评估的是，他们知道如何，他们的床边方式如何？他们是否知道如何激励人们想要相信上帝并认识基督，那不是可量化的？它不容易量化。更难发现这是否是一个真正可以成为那样的福音牧师的人。

我想要，我可以系统地创建一个，你知道，一种流水线的方法是测试和分数，你知道，你在神学上得到这个分数，在圣经上得到这个分数，在教会历史上得到这个分数，在这个上得到这个分数，嘿，他们得到了97分。再说一次，我们都知道，当然，你可以在所有分数上得到97%，但却是一个糟糕的牧师，如你所知。所以如何评估它，不幸的是，一旦你在谈论品格和智慧，我不知道如何做，除了说，你必须，你必须创建社区来评估人，你知道，你必须，实际上看到一个孩子在学校做得更好，表现出对学习的兴趣，与他的同学相处得很好，这并不难，我不知道，你能稍微量化一点吗，通常成绩上升，是的，你可以量化，有人它是完全可量化的吗，可能不是，所以我想你可能必须做的是你必须，我不知道这如何运作，但你必须试着争论让学校不要那么以测试分数为导向，这就是我能告诉你的全部，我，那不是运动，是吗，运动都朝着另一个方向。嗯，这有点像我说的，他们声称他们两边都在说话，因为这是教学，教学，钱被，你知道，花在引进像塞尔吉奥瓦尼这样的人身上，他们给出完全相反的信息，他说，你知道，孩子们在外面创造社会资本，如果你不允许他们在学校创造它，那么他们会自己创造它，这就是为什么我们有问题，我们有学校暴力问题，你知道，这正在推动城市的很多对话，影响学校，学校里的警察，所以这有点，你知道，但人们，这有点像如果我们对此保持安静，他们知道它在哪里起作用，我与这里的老师进行了对话，我看到这里有些人，他们的教室在绝对混乱中运作，原因是因为我们正在谈论的，但你被告知，嗯，这真的是关于工作的，所以有这种不言而喻的，所以它，我想问题的一部分也是，你在多大程度上引用真正的原因，因为我的学校正在转变，为什么我有五条规则，其中之一是以你想要被对待的方式对待他人，我理解那没有解决我作为家长无法做的长期问题，它至少建立了，你理解，但这一切都好像，保持黄金法则，你在使它，你在使它明确，你基本上根据黄金法则来判断孩子，但那不是可以被测试的东西。对。

但它最终影响测试分数，比如，你知道，你说多少，因为当他们问为什么时，他们发现，教室在运作，通常是一个使用那种哲学的老师，这与他们使用的教学方法无关，所以你在多大程度上让人们参与其中？嗯，尽可能地，因为你不认为，在某些情况下，你的上级会拿走你的脑袋，如果你在其他地方，它不会，试着把自己放在一个你认为有，如你所知，公共的，它就像一个游泳池，你的公立学校系统有热点和冷点，试着进入一个热点，推动你知道是正确方式的东西。提问，对吗？好的。我有一个。

哦，我们还有一个。对不起。是的。作为一名基督徒管理员，你如何看待我们作为社区的一部分领导我们学校的所有角色？你知道，许多学校，人们进来又出去，与社区没有互动，我认为我们有责任，更多的是作为基督教教育者和管理员，所以你如何看待所有角色？

是的。你是对的。说服人们相信这一点是你的工作。这里有一本书的建议。我想最终它看起来相当悲观，但我从中得到了很多。

我的一个朋友写了一本书叫《品格之死》，作者是詹姆斯·亨特，它实际上是关于道德教育的。他的基本观点，这有点难以反驳，也许你可以从书中得到一些东西在你的老师身上使用，就是说社区创造品格。他说案例研究做不到。他说社区创造品格，孩子们在那里看到某些行为模式，他们看到人们说同样的事情。如果老师们不互相交谈，你们每个人都是一个独立的操作者，只是一个企业家，你们根本不是一个社区。

重点是品格是由社区形成的。它不是，你不能在教室里形成。你不能，你知道，你给出很好的案例研究。这是正义。这是公平。

这是爱。这是耐心。但除非他们看到公平、爱和耐心为他们示范，否则他们不会学到它。他们必须看到它以那种方式得到肯定和加强。所以如果你的老师不相信它，到你的老师相信它的程度，到你使它成为一个社区的程度，到那个程度，这将是一所有效的学校。

我知道这是一场大战。你想让人们提问吗？我在南布朗克斯教高中，幸运的是布朗克斯的每个人都知道他们需要上帝，所以，或者某种东西，所以他们让我为他们的孩子祈祷。我真的没有问题。我在公立学校教书。

但是当你恢复自己的活力时，你会怎么做？因为作为一名教师，我已经觉得，而且你是一名教师，我的意思是，你带着你的，对吗？你真的很强壮。我是一名教师。对。

好的。谢谢。作为一名教育工作者，真的。就像作为一名教育工作者，你休这个安息日，对吗？

你在夏天花这段时间，我想知道，你做什么，你的哪些部分，做了很多年后你感到耗尽了，因为这终于是我的第二年。你知道上帝需要在你身上工作哪些部分？因为我觉得今年夏天，我又教书了，我没有休假，但我感觉有点，你知道，我是说筋疲力尽，所以你做什么，在很多年后你是如何来到的？是的。好的。

嗯，我必须，如你所说，你们中的一些人，如果你在数，我实际上从讲道中抽出两个月。我为其中一个月所做的是我实际上在写作，我决定尝试每年整理一本书，或者如果我，我不是说我每年都能写一本书，但我在尝试，我在尝试写一本书，尝试在一个月内写一本书。其中一个优点是，这实际上是相当艰苦的工作，但不是与人在一起，它，它更多是研究，我通常从写书中得到大量的想法用于我的讲道。第二件事是我做的是一个月，我休整整一个月的假期，但在那个月期间，我，我可能会把我的祷告时间增加三倍，比如我尝试每天做两到三个小时。这听起来像，哇，多么属灵的去，哇，我的意思是，我在读，你知道，我在读圣经，这不像我只是坐在那里看，看，我不看云三个小时，我，你知道，我使用公祷书，我，你知道，读冥想信件和讲道并研究圣经和祈祷。

我实际上，另一件事是，我有，大概有12个人，我不是说人，真的，像夫妇，我认识很多很多年的人，是我可以与他们放松的人，我可以，可以找到的人，我可以分享的人，我所面临的，我确保我接触到他们。实际上，如果可能的话，我尝试与他们一起度假。所以这是，这是，这是整整一个月非常密集的人们，时间和祷告时间。一个月非常，实际上，相当密集，实际上，我喜欢这一周的是，剩下的月份，写书的月份是我实际上有更多的时间工作，比我一年中其余时间可以在我的讲道上工作，因为我，你知道，我每周有那么多时间，因为我很忙，我在外面，我在做像这样的事情。所以这是，这是真的，真的在象牙塔里一个月。

然后真正与人在一起并祈祷一个月。但改变和休息一样好，顺便说一句，但你做，如果我只是讲道，我，我曾经，我曾经，我，我过去做的是我过去去度假，人们说，哦，当你在，在记忆中时，你能在这里讲道吗？我过去常这样做。那不是一个好主意。你必须让土地，活着，休耕一段时间，否则你，它，它耗尽，最终你无法从中得到更多的碎屑。

好的，就这些。是的，请讲。晚上好，祝福你，嗨，大家好。我一直在服务不足的学校工作。我开始在东纽约工作，然后我转到南布朗克斯。

我做了所谓的整合转移，需要多样化的学校。嗯，今年九月是我第一次去弗吉尼亚的第2区，现在我只是在21街和第1街，一些主要是白人和亚洲学生，那里有一些西班牙裔和黑人。但在其他学校，服务不足的学校，你有自由教你想教的东西，使用你想用的书。在这所学校，一切都非常规范，我们必须教，释放强大的《人鼠之间》。我对一些文学作品感到困难，因为，你知道，《人鼠之间》里有很多专业知识，我不想在课堂上见到很多书。

我想要一些建议。不，你是说，你是说你想要一些帮助，你知道，如何，如何教它，还是你只是不知道，你必须读某些书和某些书。你必须大声读出来。我很舒服，是的，我对说某些不舒服，某些书在哪里？嗯，我知道这就像，我知道这，我知道这，我知道这，我知道这，我知道这就像，这听起来像一种牧师应该回答，但我，我会出去说，在我看来，当你作为一名教师这样做时，我的意思是，基督教演员问过我类似的事情，而且更糟。

他们说的是，好的，我是基督徒，我在这里被要求表演并说我不同意的话，你知道，我使用脏话或实际上以我不真正同意的某种方式行动。我说，嗯，如果你读圣经，圣经里有很多可怕的事情。圣经中有些地方谈论一些相当糟糕的事情，事实上，有很多，很多时候你知道这一点，因为我在，在服务中说这个，翻译有时会净化希伯来语和希腊语实际上所说的内容。它在告诉你关于事情有多糟糕的故事。人们真的这样说话。

人们真的做这些可怕的事情。这不是，你不想不得不甚至看那个，但文学的目的是把它带出来。所以我会说，你大声说出来没有错，因为在某种意义上，当你读它时，你是一个演员。你在扮演角色。这不是你真正的样子。

你在向孩子们传达这本书。他们当然听过脏话。他们住在纽约市。但我总是告诉他们，你知道，在这种情况下我不对他们骂人。是的。

你是对的。不，不，不。是的。我想我应该只是说这个。我为这本书这样做，但我不想听到任何人在我听到的情况下这样说话，我不这样说话。

好的。是的。好的。在不同的话题上，我想问你一些关于疲惫的事情，只是延续你所说的。我有一个非常好的夏天，我完全放松，我热情地开始这一年，一周后。

这已经，我觉得我太累了，无法做任何事情，我认为教学的困难之一是你永远不会到达一个终点。从来没有一个时刻你觉得，好的，我已经做了我需要做的一切，就这样，我可以关闭。批改工作不断到来，但甚至不是那个，而是在我脑海中不断审查课程，无法关闭工作，周末到来，整个，你知道，周日都花在做批改和准备上。所以当，例如，服务从9点30分改到10点30分时，我很恼火，因为这意味着我回家晚了，不能做那么多学校作业，但我的意思是，似乎我无法控制这一点，我已经教了15年了，每年我，你知道，对自己说，我要实现平衡，但它从未发生过。所以我只是...

你几点到家？你晚上工作吗？我每天早上大约6点45分在学校，晚上大约7点回家。周末也是。你晚上做事情吗？

不。是的。想想这个。我是...我一直...

我一直倾向于过度工作，我一辈子作为牧师可能每周工作大约75、80小时，但这里是...如果你想想你的...你有七天，除非你想想早上下午和晚上，当然如果你的晚上从七点开始，这有点...我的意思是，那没关系。你仍然有大约三个小时的房间。

所以你有早上...所以你有21个时间段，对吗？七天，三次？我不是数学专业的。数学老师七乘三乘一是什么？

好的。你有21个时间段。确保你在任何情况下都休息七个，你不教书，你不做课程七个。然后我能够做到这一点。我必须每周休息一天，两天，三天。

这意味着在某个地方我必须休息一个下午和一个下午，还有三个其他晚上，因为我晚上出去，我有时晚上工作。如果你能休息七个，你就能生存。我在相当长的时间里对我的孩子们来说，出于某种奇怪的原因，他们不记得我是一个缺席的父亲，这仍然是我不知道我是如何躲过那颗子弹的。如果你有孩子，凯迪斯就是你休息那七个的地方。只要确保并让自己安息，还要做一些与你工作无关的阅读，确保对此有纪律，说我每周至少要有两到三个小时的阅读。

也许甚至每晚，一个小时，你正在阅读的一些与你工作无关的书总是让你觉得你有更多的生活。只是几个想法。21个中的7个。是的，丽贝卡。我实际上告诉我的老师回家，我回家，因为这件事，这个参考是我们正在谈论的，要新鲜，要为他们有想法，要情感上休息，在我看来，这就是他们从中得到的，而不是你正在准备的实际课程。

所以你可能甚至没有认识到当他们有高压情况时你无法互动。所以你只需要退出，你不是你的工作。我对我的老师说，你是希拉里，你是一名教师，你不要成为你的工作，特别是作为一名基督徒，你有一个更容易的方式来扎根自己，并说这是它结束的地方。如果你得到的想法少于，我知道这一直在发生，你知道，起来写下它们，然后离开它，因为这只是不可持续。我认为你必须记住，最终他们得到的是你带给它的精神。

如果你筋疲力尽，你没有用对你来说很棒的东西来补充自己，果酱或其他什么，那么它会显现出来。这里有其他人想说什么吗？你只是不在夏天工作。好的，你的财务状况如何，不要在夏天工作。凯瑟琳，我们还能问一两个问题吗？

是的，请讲。我是一名教学研究员，在，那两年我是教学研究员，我觉得这是一场比赛，我到了第二年，我说，我完成了，我要离开我的学校，去一个更大更好的地方。但实际上，我在布朗克斯教书，实际上是说服我留在我学校的家长。你知道，出于所有伟大的原因。所以说了这些，丽贝卡，你知道，用了那个关于黄金法则的东西，教黄金法则。

我在布朗克斯教室里有26个幼儿园小朋友，我们所做的就是教他们黄金法则，关于被爱彼此，彼此友善。但是当这些孩子回到这些显然不与他们的老师沟通的家长那里，他们教授极端相反的东西时，你该怎么办？因为我们在教室里做得很好。教室里没有暴力。但在操场上，你为什么打那个孩子？

因为我妈妈告诉我，如果有人打我，我就打他回去。所以这是超越教室的事情，超越你作为教师的角色。你如何解决这个问题？你不能去找家长说，你必须实践黄金法则。那么对这些家长有什么实用的方法呢？

教师。我举办育儿工作坊。我们在10月2日做的事情之一，珍妮特在那里，我们做的是，我们邀请家长与一个以社区为基础的组织，一次会议，我们做了一个戏剧工作坊，一个舞蹈工作坊，一个绘画媒体工作坊。我们做了这个作为家庭日，我们呼吁与家庭共度时光，我们邀请孩子与家长一起来我们学校。我认为这是管理能力，你需要去找你的管理员，要求他们创造性地思考，而不是举行一个你坐着的家长会议。

事实上，其中一位家长在最后的会议上说了这句话。我们汇报，他们对我说，这是如此令人耳目一新，每当我之前去参加家长会时，管理员所做的只是对我吼叫，你知道？我的交易就像，我对吼叫人不感兴趣。我想让他们坐下来，实际上与他们的孩子一起做活动，我们邀请员工也做那些活动，但我认为你需要去找你的管理员说，我在这里有一个问题。我们能集思广益解决方法吗？

我认为你需要在你的社区的不同时间全面地做到这一点。我们在我的地方有一个困难的人口。我和有很多你说的相同问题的家长，然后是高中。顺便说一句，你可以作为校长那样做，虽然，因为她不能作为教师那样做。她可以去找校长。

好的。是的，问题。但是，我的意思是，我的校长这样做。我们做周六工作坊，家庭工作坊，但这些家长不来。他们不来参加。

他们不来参加家长会。当你打电话给他们时，他们不接电话。你知道，我想留下来，我想做这个，我想与这些在孩子学校生活中缺席的家长一起工作。那么我作为教师可以做什么来出去与这些家长交谈？什么，有效的一件事，这是我生活的故事，我今天开了四个小时的会议，试图解释一些同样的事情。

如果你只是非常，如果你从逻辑上解释它，也就是，我理解在街上，因为这正是，我的意思是，我的孩子被跳，他们害怕承认谁在做什么？因为他们离开学校时会被跳。这非常严重。有帮派成员。我的意思是，我知道这是我们很多人的相同故事，但解释是学校。

当你走进学校的大门和院子就是学校，那是你责任的一部分。课间发生什么？所以我还没有一个家长不同意，我有，我有家长写它，把它写下来，我告诉他们打回去，只是让你知道。但是一旦你与他们对话，你可以作为教师这样做，也就是，我如何保护你的孩子？如果你告诉你的孩子打回去，他也告诉他的孩子打回去，然后每个人都在打，当我对他们说，我不想你服从你的权威。

他们总是尊重那个。我不想你服从你的权威，但我不能保护他们。如果下次是你的孩子，他的父母说了同样的话怎么办？所以当他们走进学校门时，我们必须以不同的方式运作。我对他们说，我不能告诉你在街上该做什么。

我理解那是一个不同的问题，但在学校门内，如果你能通过对孩子说，给老师和员工机会，给我机会让他们安全来帮助我们。那是你说的吗？是的。好的。管理员做，你知道，反派，即使今天我理解有一些这样的情况，一位家长实际上试图打另一个学生，管理员必须介入，让家长意识到你希望我们为你的孩子做什么？

一旦你把它带回给家长，他的孩子可能是下一个受害者，然后他们确实退后一步，更理性地思考一点。这是逻辑的过程和后续跟进，他们通常会回家。有很好的答案吗？请讲。你能听到我吗？

一件事是，你知道，这有点在与教育工作者的所有对话的暗流之下，作为你的老师，试图实施来自管理层和来自公立学校教师的教育部的大局，我已经是一名教师，所以我理解，但有点在硬币的另一面，我现在在教育部，我只是想让你们所有人知道，今晚在这里对我来说非常鼓舞人心。就其价值而言，教育部有人每天为你们所有人祈祷。这可能很难离开，但是...我当然会说，我会感激，我们都会，好吧，我会感激你的祷告。然后我对你们所有人的快速问题是，当我是一名教师，我既在公立学校工作，又与布朗克斯和曼哈顿的教区学校合作时，有几个时刻，我真的可以向你发送一个信息，上帝在某种程度上向我展示了我与家长互动的方式或我在某种情况下的态度完全被他作为基督徒给我的恩典所注入，对不起，我有点不安。

所以我对你们所有人的问题是，也许如果你有一个小的轶事故事，来自你自己作为教育工作者的经历，如果当你刚说，比如，天哪，除非我有这个世界观，否则我无法处理那个。我开始。我们谈到我们祈祷，我们很多人祈祷，我们说我们不能在没有祈祷的情况下开始一天，无论是在学校阅读圣经还是与其他人一起，因为我每天到学校，这是一种冒险的感觉，因为我们永远不知道，你知道，你有最好的计划，每个人都应该到位，然后一个孩子摔倒并受伤。我们有一个轶事，一个幼儿园孩子在院子里摔倒，他们认为她只是碰到了她的下巴，当她去看医生时，她的下巴骨折了，她的下巴不得不被固定，这是带着恐惧和颤抖。当她来时，你如何与那位家长说话？

在那种情况下你对家长说什么？家长会如何反应？所以总是有这种祷告，家长进来，管理员在那里，我们与家长交谈，然后有时他们进来非常敌对，有时他们有问题，他们只是需要有人交谈，当我们与他们说话，请求圣灵把正确的话放在，至少在我们嘴里，当我们说话时，家长有时他们变得非常平静，或者那位家长可能只是哭泣，或者我们需要只是一个拥抱，我们有父母正在垂死的孩子的实例，他们知道他们正在垂死，他们有关于我的孩子会发生什么的问题，只是一个拥抱，然后当那位家长离开时，他们感觉更好，或者情况平静下来，我们说感谢上帝，你知道，上帝是如此美好，我们一直这样说，因为我们没有想法或没有计划如何面对那种情况，所以它发生，我认为在我学校几乎每天都发生。只是回到几分钟前琼提出的家长问题，它实际上就在我来这里之前发生了，我说我花了很多时间调查与帮派相关的事件，我实际上今天学校安全部门不得不带出两位家长，因为他们对谈话如此愤怒，我想老实说，就像你的第一个倾向之一会是，虽然我无法完成调查，因为你因为你的行为而不得不被护送出去，所以也许我会在没有弄清楚真相的情况下继续记录这确实发生了，但我坚持了一天的其余时间，我在电话上回叫了家长，这真的不是我认为我在最后一次会议的方式之后来这里之前应该做的，试图在积极之后，但我告诉了她调查的状态，她的儿子实际上不是参与事件的一方之一，她说，马龙女士，我整天都感觉很糟糕，我只是想向你道歉，所以我只是知道，在那，就像能够回叫她这件事，这不是，这只是上帝的恩典，在它被你知道的两个或三个人走出去之后给我那个，我知道那完全是恩典。

你试图重新编织一些你可以告诉需要被关联的东西，这些东西需要相互关联，但它们不是，这非常非常非常令人沮丧，但你们是基督徒，你们知道这意味着什么，这意味着你们最终想看到发生的事情将会发生，最终会有和平，最终会有正义，最终会有完整的家庭，最终你不会有父母垂死，你将拥有一个重新编织的创造，上帝将会做到，我的意思是，有很多工作比你的工作更令人满意，因为你在制造一些东西，你把它做好，然后你把它送出去，人们购买它，你赚你的钱，你回家，你的产品是改变生命、成熟和智慧，因此你总是对你的产品不满意，我的意思是，它只是从来不是你想要的样子，这非常非常令人沮丧，但你们是基督徒，你们根本不是在打一场败仗，所有悲伤的事情有一天都会成真，所以你们站在正确的一边，你们必须活在那种希望中，现在让我们祈祷。天父，我们感谢你呼召我们在这个房间里成为教育工作者，你呼召我们进入一项似乎如此混乱的工作，它不像生产一台机器并销售它，它不像那么多其他工作，其中产品是可量化的，底线是如此容易掌握、驱动和认识，我们在谈论改变生命，我们在谈论学习智慧，我们在谈论成熟，我们在谈论人们成为真正的人，这似乎是一个无尽的也许失败的事业，但它不是，我们知道它不是，因为是基督徒，我们感谢你在这个房间里的男女们是你在世界上医治和修复和重新编织你的创造的代理人的所有方式，感谢你，复活的耶稣向我们证明，有一天你将完全满足我们最深切的愿望，看到我们的城市整个家庭整个，所以感谢你这段时间，继续成为我们伟大的教师耶稣基督，奉他的名祷告。阿门。

根本没办法知道。看起来就是这样，压力全没了。让我，让，好的，好的。让我建议，C.S. 路易斯唯一写过的关于公共教育的书，这本书据说就是关于这个的——《人之废除》，一本小书，简短的书，是那种人人都想要的。让我分享这本书中的两个想法。

如果你是一名教师，从未读过这本书，或者很久没读过，我建议你读一读，因为它是关于教育的。第一篇文章叫《没有胸膛的人》，非常著名，在其中，他引用了当时写的一本书，我想是在 1940 年代，一本据说是给高中学生用的英国文学教科书，就是我们所说的高中。在那本书中，有这样一段著名的引文，路易斯引用了它。他说，那本教科书说，当人们说瀑布是壮美的，他们以为自己在说关于瀑布的非常重要的事情，但他们只是在说关于他们对瀑布的感受。而路易斯指出，这正是现代的本质，这是现代性的本质。

这是现代西方文化的本质。他们所说的是，如果你谈论一个客观事实，某种可以被证明的东西，某种可以经验性调查的东西，那是

一个事实。但如果你说任何无法用经验证明的东西，如果你说通奸是一种罪，或者我相信上帝，或者一个瀑布是崇高的，你只是在谈论感受。这是主观的。这并不真正重要，大卫说。

而路易斯指出，这就是本质，如果你是一名公立学校教师，这就是你问题的本质。你被允许谈论，据说，你被允许谈论任何主观的、经验证明的、可以理性研究的东西。但当涉及到道德价值观、宗教信仰，我相信上帝，我认为通奸是错的。每当你涉及任何无法证明的东西，那就是主观的。那应该被保持私密。

你不被允许谈论那些。当然这是一个很热门的议题，但在政治上，我被允许将我的道德观带入公共领域吗？有些人说，不，当然不行。你不能把你的宗教或道德观带入公共领域，带入政治。在那里我们只谈论什么是合理和理性的，而不是你认为的道德价值观。

路易斯回应说，如果你真的相信一切都是相对的，当涉及到道德时，他有一个非常著名的地方，他说，如果你真的以这种方式教育学生，如果你真的教育学生相信，客观的、事实的东西是一回事。但所有道德观点，所有关于道德、宗教或类似事物的观点都是完全主观的，完全应该被保持私密。完全相对的，也就是说，相对于你个人的意识或你所在的文化。他说，你意识到会发生什么，这是结束那篇文章的引用。他说，你很难打开一份期刊而不遇到这样的陈述：我们的文明需要动力或更多的自我牺牲。

在一种可怕的简单化中，我们移除了器官却要求功能。我们造就了没有胸怀的人，却期待他们有美德和进取心。我们嘲笑荣誉，却对在我们中间发现骗子感到震惊。我们阉割了，却命令被阉割的马匹繁衍后代。而他真正要说的是，如果你真的说一切都是

相对的，除了那些经验证明的，自我牺牲，为什么要自我牺牲？

为什么要关心公共利益？为什么要做一个好公民？为什么？他说，你不能那样教育人。那么答案是什么？

他实际上提出了一个叫做"道"的概念。他所说的道，T-A-O，是从中国的理念中借用的，认为有一种，它是自然法。他说他相信，而且几乎所有宗教都相信，宗教在许多方面确实有所不同，比如你如何得救。所有人类对神和对是非都有一些基本的理解，我们直觉地知道这些。路易斯在此基础上提出论证，天主教徒称之为自然法，而新教徒称之为普遍恩典。

基于人们直觉地知道某些事情这一事实，你可以进行教育，你可以基于这种理解来呼吁，即存在所谓的普遍恩典。那么，我这是什么意思呢？这对于在基督教学校或私立学校以及公立学校的人来说，实际上都非常重要。顺便说一句，我在这里给你们的是对自然法、对普遍恩典更偏新教的观点。新教的观点是，如果你对罪有一个狭隘的理解，认为罪只是违反某些规则，你应该使之更加充实，根据圣经对罪有一个深厚、充实的理解，一个深厚、充实的罪观，就是罪是让任何事物比神更重要。

罪是偶像崇拜。因此，民族主义，把你的家庭或你的道德记录，或把教义的纯正，作为使我们优于其他人的东西。这些都是偶像崇拜和自以为义的形式，当然还有物质主义、性、权力、攻击性暴力。它们都是偶像。因此，对罪的充实理解不仅仅是你违反规则，因为如你所知，法利赛人是可怕的罪人，因为他们极度自以为义，充满骄傲，是可怕的人，尽管他们遵守所有规则。

其次，如果你想理解自然法和普遍恩典，你必须对恩典有一个深厚的理解。这就是我所说的

对恩典有深刻的理解。你需要明白，在罗马书第一章第18到25节，我们读到这样的话。我能找到。是的，经文这样说。

罗马书1章25节说，自从造天地以来，神的永能和神性是明明可知的，虽是眼不能见，但借着所造之物就可以晓得，叫人无可推诿。这话是说，所有人基本上都知道黄金法则，基本上都知道我们不该自私，基本上都知道应该照顾家人，基本上都知道对与错，但他们却压制这真理。但有趣的是，这些动词"被理解"、"被看见"，都是现在被动分词。这意味着，在任何时刻，地球上的每一个人在其内心深处，都在经历一场对话，一场关于他们对神的认识、对是非的认识，以及他们自己拜偶像之心的对话。所以每一个文化产品，每一首诗，每一件艺术品，每一篇文章，每一篇专栏，所有被创作出来的东西，都是这种对话的结果，这意味着，如果你，如果我作为一个基督徒，正在创作一个文化产品——顺便说一句，讲道也是一种文化产品——那么其中就有偶像崇拜，就有错误的东西，就有拜偶像的话语在里面。

我在某种程度上，永远无法完全做到恰到好处，我可能对自己的长老会背景感到骄傲，我可能在说话的方式上缺乏谦卑。我的意思是，换句话说，在我所说的话中，既有真理，也有偶像崇拜。但对于非基督徒，根据罗马书第一章，那些甚至公开说他们不相信神的人，当他们制作电影，当他们创作艺术作品，当他们写文章时，其中总有一些对神真理的见证。这表明，由于普遍恩典，非基督徒一直在说一些好的东西。而鲁益师说，你必须理解普遍恩典，如果你要从事教育，你必须对罪有深刻的认识，对恩典也要有深刻的认识，原因就在这里。

如果情况确实如此，这就是为什么当我被问到这个问题时，我很难相信基督教教育，

基督教学校，或者公立教育，基督徒与公立学校这个话题，我很难相信这两者中的任何一个是唯一的出路。我很难相信那是教育人的唯一方式。在我看来，如果你在基督教学校，我确实有——你马上会听到，我的孩子们到处都上过学，这显示了缺乏纪律或缺乏一致的教育理念，或者也许我有其他一些原因，但我不难看到，当我把孩子送进基督教学校时，他们常常会带着某些方式出来，在这些方式中他们学习圣经。你可以看到偶像化的话语，你可以看到僵化，我永远不会忘记我一年级的儿子从弗吉尼亚州霍普的基督教学校回家，他说，我们今天为公立学校的孩子们祷告了，为什么？因为他们不能祷告，他们的信仰一直受到攻击，这是一年级。

虽然其中有一些偶像化的话语，好吧，就是这样。另一方面，在公立学校，如果你是基督徒，你将不得不不是通过引用圣经来教育，而是通过诉诸自然的、普遍的恩典。你必须期待，首先，不是信徒的人或者是其他宗教信徒的人会对真理有一些理解，你知道，只是给你一个真实的例子，明显的例子，强奸。几乎每个人都认为强奸是错的，为什么？你能科学地证明它吗？

绝对不能。它是理性的吗，嗯，它是实用的，但没有理性或经验的方法来证明强奸是错的。为什么我们都认为强奸是错的？为什么它被铭刻在我们的立法中？为什么我们可以在公立学校的教室里说，强奸是错的？

你意识到那是一个价值观吗？那是一个信念。那是我们相信是错的东西，但我们永远无法证明，但普遍恩典和自然启示，无论我们几乎是谁，我们都直觉地知道它。现在你要做的是你必须找到那些其他的地方，你必须基于自然的、普遍的恩典来推理，最后，只是在这里编码，需要意识到的重要事情之一是越来越

我知道你们有些人会说，我看不出来，好吧，但我看得出来。公立学校或者说我们的公共机构将越来越难以继续维持事实与价值之间的这种区分。

越来越多的人认识到，你所说的一切都是基于信仰假设，就像我刚才给你举的强奸的例子。当有人说，我们都知道强奸是错的，为什么我们知道强奸是错的？这是一种信仰行为。这是一种道德判断。当有人说，你不能把你的道德判断带入课堂时，你必须意识到每个人都在这样做。

每个人都在说，基于我对现实本质的理解，基于我认为我们都身处其中的那个故事的理解，有一个个人主义的启蒙运动故事，它说除了人权之外真的没有真理，我们也应该自由地决定什么对我们来说是正确的，但那是一个故事。那是一种理解全部现实的方式，它是一种世界观，它是一种信仰的事情，你无法证明它。如果你是一位基督徒教师，无论你是在我们基督徒的私立学校，还是在我们基督徒的公立学校，或是在你的基督教学校，向你的学生展示几乎每一个陈述都嵌入在一种道德观或世界观中，并将其识别为这样的东西，这将变得越来越重要和可能。所以你知道，你说马丁·路德·金为民权而奋斗，因为他为什么这样做？他是说，一切都是相对的，每个人都必须决定什么对他们来说是正确的吗？

他说，因为圣经是这样说的，他确实这样说了，他说，让公义如江河滔滔。他是一位非裔美国新教徒，在他的理解中，你知道的，我想黑人活动家走向公民不服从的原因，而不是他们的白人自由派朋友在1950年代所说的，是因为他们的白人自由派朋友是人文主义者，不相信人类是有罪的。但是那些阅读莱因霍尔德·尼布尔和圣经的黑人活动家，他们确实知道人类是有罪的，他们永远不会，

美国白人不会主动放弃权力，除非他们被迫这样做，而他们想要以一种仍然是基督徒的、充满爱的方式来做这件事，所以他们进行了公民不服从运动，和平的公民不服从运动。你必须展示马丁·路德·金所做的事情来自于对人性、对上帝、对是非的一种特定理解，因为每个人说的任何话，即使是那些相信人权的人，都来自于启蒙运动对生活的看法。越来越多地，你将能够，你将不得不向人们讲述这些故事，让你的学生认识到每一个道德主张，每一个任何类型的主张，都嵌入在一个世界观中。

你必须能够说出这一点，越来越多地，那些处于顶层的人，哲学家们知道不存在所谓的理性，它只是不嵌入在对终极实在的特定理解中，而且越来越多地，你也将能够做到这一点。所以基于普遍恩典，基于对这些事物的理解，我实际上认为这意味着我们这些在基督教教育中的人，像我一样，必须认识到我们基督教教育的有限性。你们这些在公共教育中的基督徒必须意识到，我认为，在智慧上教导人们的真正可能性，以及在公开谈论各种信仰观点方面日益增加的可能性。所以现在，我这样说是因为我猜想当我现在收到这些问题时，我将倾向于参考这个来自《人的废除》的基本洞见。好吗？

所以我应该在接下来的45分钟里主导讨论。嗯，我应该接受提问，我认为这意味着小组讨论。你们应该向我提出问题，首先，关于什么样的学校，私立的、公立的、基督教的、家庭学校，不是吗，凯瑟琳？让我们试试，让我们向我提出关于这个的问题一会儿，我会尽力回答，你们也可以回应，然后我会开始。我认为当我们谈论选择和哲学时，真正归结到的是我们如何过所有的生活，我们把孩子放在哪里，我们选择住在哪里。

所以我从长远的角度知道

与你的关系，实际上，你最小的儿子去了布朗克斯科学高中，他有一位数学家教，那位老师当时在我管理的一所基督教学校教书。对，我的大儿子一直上的是公立学校。一直上到毕业。纽约公立学校。纽约公立学校。

但我确信你把其他孩子送到了基督教寄宿学校。我想问你的问题是，你是如何经历那个过程的，为什么，在选择上有什么不同，你为什么做出这些选择，回顾过去，你会如何建议今天的父母与他们的孩子一起生活？好的，这里有两个问题。首先是，我为什么这样做？我的三个儿子，我们在这里快16年了，已经进入第16年了，我们的大儿子一直上的是公立学校。

我们另外两个儿子上的是公立学校，迈克尔，我的二儿子上公立学校一直到九年级，然后我把他送到了石溪，那是一所基督教寄宿学校，距离有一个半小时的路程。我的小儿子乔纳森，我想是上公立学校到四年级，从五年级到八年级，去了一所天主教学校，所以顺便说一下，我真的很多元化。然后他去了，然后他也去了石溪，那所基督教寄宿学校。第一，我是认真的。我妻子，我谈到了，在我来之前要确保我妻子和我在这个问题上仍然意见一致。

那就是我们确实看到了各种教育形式的优势。我们没有，如果基督徒不积极投入到这些教育形式中的每一种——私立的、基督教的、私立的和公立的，我会感到失望。我认为我们可以在每一种教育中做大量的好事和更新工作。这就是为什么，因为我对其中任何一种都没有哲学上的问题，我们可以自由地选择我们认为适合孩子的那一种。我们对基督教教育或公立教育都没有问题，因此我们能够做出选择。

如果他能进入汤森哈里斯，我们可能会让他留在这里。他试图进入汤森哈里斯，但事后看来，我们真的做出了正确的选择，因为他

本来会住在家里，但那对他来说不是最好的选择。乔纳森坚持说他也不想去石溪分校。当我们回顾往事时，仍然不确定那是不是最好的主意，但同时……我们认为那也还可以，所以他就去了，因为他真的非常想去。顺便说一下，那些既是家长又是教师的人都知道，这就是你处理这些事情的方式。

你要逐个情况具体分析。现在，如果我们认为公立学校不好，或者基督教学校，不不不，这些都不行，我们就不会有那么多选择，但我们确实有。事实上，顺便说一下，除此之外，我的妹妹，我最亲爱的妹妹，我爱她到天上去，是我认识的最好的在家教育者。她在家教育。很多人信不信由你。

你会说，好吧，不仅是她自己的五个孩子，还有邻居家所有其他的孩子，我想是这样的。而且一直都……所以我已经绕了一圈。今天我们会对……我会对作为基督徒的家长说同样的话，你确实有很多选择，你真的应该逐个情况具体分析，我实际上希望基督徒们能够分布得更广泛。我确实认为我们实际上需要在城市里有更多的基督教学校。

我也认为我们需要基督徒更积极地参与到公立学校以及公立学校的更新中去。我希望百花齐放。我真的认为这是完全可能的。我认为因为我们很多人……这很难……如果你作为教师在公立学校工作，我希望你会觉得这是……你觉得自己的方法是更优越的，这没什么问题。如果你不觉得有点……

我的意思是，我想要……这是一个非常奇怪的张力。我想要感觉……我想要我团队中的每个人都觉得没有教会像救赎主教会一样。你知道，你必须觉得这是最好的教会。你必须对此小心，因为这更多是情感上的而不是理智上的。

你退一步想。你必须说不，等一下。还有很多其他很好的教会。所以如果你投身于某个领域，你也应该有同样的感觉

公开的……如果你想为这座城市创建伟大的基督教学校，而你明确了这一点，你真的想这样做，那么你完全可以觉得这是我的热情所在，这是我想做的事。并且觉得……

我想尽可能多地招募人们加入其中，反之亦然，公立学校也是如此。所以这就是为什么我……我们必须根据具体情况逐一分析。好的，还有其他问题吗？我只是想提供一点背景。我不是基督教学校和公立学校的产物，所以我认为不仅要考虑什么适合……什么适合孩子，还要考虑孩子生命中的不同时期，所以我认为，你知道，这非常重要。

我还想说明一下为什么我作为一名管理者坐在这里，这是直接的结果，凯瑟琳提到我在领导力学院。我在领导力学院的原因，长话短说，是源于Klein校长访问我在东弗拉特布什工作的一所学校时的一次对话，那是一所失败的学校，我在那里教书，我等不及他到那里就想告诉他一切出了什么问题，并谈论，你怎么能让孩子们生活在这样的条件下？总之，在那次对话中，他说，嗯，你是如何让学生阅读的？他们的哥哥姐姐甚至都不会阅读。那么你做了这个吗？

你做了那个吗？是因为你去的研究生院吗？是因为那个吗？我说，实际上，这是关于为我们创建一个有爱心的社区。所以每天在我的课堂上，我以晨会开始，我们讨论以我们希望被对待的方式对待彼此意味着什么。

我详细讲述了整个过程，期待他，你知道，逃走，因为这与他们推动的统一课程改革努力毫无关系。而实际上，他的反应是他听了大约30分钟，然后他说，你能把所有这些都发邮件给我吗？我想，嗯，你知道，这只是某种，你知道，让她感觉良好的方式。她给了我所有这些废话什么的。但随着对话的进行？

他说，事实上，我真的需要你申请这个项目。

我问，哪个项目？他说，领导力学院，而你对此一无所知。我说，哦，不，我想当老师。我对行政管理毫无兴趣。

他说，我知道，这正是我需要你去那里的原因。所以我最后给他发了一封电子邮件，基本上是一份政策备忘录，标题是"用黄金法则改造纽约市学校"。毫无疑问，这就是我带到领导力学院的声音，也是我试图带到这所学校的声音。所以我只想说，确实有很多机会。而我们在公共教育方面面临着如此严重的危机，坦率地说。

他们真的不在乎你说这来自哪里，只要它有用。与此相辅相成的是质量。你不能到处说我是基督徒，我是基督徒，却做着不合标准的工作，而这太常成为一个借口。所以我只想重申，这是，你知道，对于所有这些，你知道，不谈论政治。有一个开放的机会来影响学校。

这是我提问的背景，我同意蒂姆的观点。但我确实有一个问题，那就是今天基督教界最响亮的声音似乎是那些反对公立学校、反对基督徒学生上公立学校的人。我确实相信每个孩子都有不同的环境。但我只想读一份引发我整个担忧的声明。这是来自雷·摩尔先生的。

雷·摩尔经营着一个名为"出埃及任务"的组织，要求所有基督徒把他们的学生、他们的孩子从公立学校撤出。引文是："一场将基督徒儿童从公立学校清除出去的运动，将会真正地激发和振兴教会，这是现代以来任何事情都未曾做到的。并可能引发我们都如此期待的复兴。"就是这样，而且这实际上得到了多布森博士和肯尼迪的支持。

所以这就是正在流传的东西。而我，你知道，也许不是在这里，但在这个国家的其他地方。所以我想我的问题是，我也在与摩尔先生的电子邮件对话中问过这个问题，特别是在像这样处于危机中的城市。我们

都能承认这个危机情况。

作为基督徒，我们该做什么？我们对公立学校的学生有什么责任？我们有哪些方式可以一起合作，在家庭学校、私立学校、基督教学校和教会之间架起桥梁？所以我不知道这算不算一个问题。不，这确实是个问题。让我说点什么。

我想确保斯科特或某人问我一个关于基督教学校的问题，如果可以的话，我的意思是，让另一只靴子落地。但让我先说点好话，嗯，不，等等。我们应该建立新教会吗？还是应该更新城市中现有的教会？现在，我对这个问题思考了很多，因为我是一个教会植堂者。

当你建立一个新教会时，很容易给人一种印象，或者甚至自己相信，周围所有其他教会都死气沉沉，这样行不通。所以我们必须建立一个真正火热的新教会。现在，事实是一个城市不会仅仅通过新教会就能为基督赢得。有成千上万的人会去现有的教会，而且只会去现有的教会。那些较老的教会，那些他们父母和祖父母曾经参加的教会，只有通过这些方式才能触及。

这是唯一能让很多人被现有教会、已建立的教会、较老的教会所触及的方式。同样真实的是，除非你建立新教会，否则较老的教会有时不会被刺激去做出改变。当救赎主教会开始时，我们真正发现了这一点。我们开始做很多其他城镇教会认为永远不会奏效的事情。但这在救赎主教会确实奏效了。

你知道接下来发生了什么，他们开始在较老的教会中做这些事情。因此，确实需要像基督教学校运动这样的东西，毫无疑问，有很多公立学校系统之外的学校可以做一些公立学校系统可以学习的事情。你必须有这样的更新，但你也必须更新公立学校。你不能放弃所有在公立学校的学生。所以我知道触及一个城市的方式不仅是建立新的

教会，而是要更新那些老教会。

这根本不是其他什么战争。多年来，有些植堂者就像这个请愿书或这个运动中的人一样。他们实际上是在说，现有的教会就是一堆垃圾，正在快速走向地狱。我们就忘掉它吧，每个人都应该出来加入我们，因为我们才是真正的新教会。这永远行不通。

这会制造摩擦、宗派主义，所以你必须两者兼顾，就这么简单。我想这就是要说的。我确实相信，对于那些谨慎的基督徒来说，会有越来越多的机会。不要搞宗派主义，要理解普遍恩典和自然法。我们将能够在公共场合谈论我们所说之事的信仰基础，因为你必须说，每个人都有一个信仰基础。

所以，当你来说这个，看，那是一种信仰，那背后有一个信仰基础。你必须向每个人解释，所以这样做的原因是，让我把这一点说完。阿拉斯代尔·麦金泰尔在1984年写了一本书叫《追寻美德》。它对思想生活产生了巨大影响，尤其是在哲学界。他说，除非你回答"它是为了什么"这个问题，否则你永远无法谈论某样东西是否是好的。

所以，你可能听过我用这个例子。你无法判断一块手表是好是坏，除非你问，它是为了什么？顺便说一句，如果你试过的话，它在修指甲方面很糟糕。但它在报时方面很棒。所以问题是，它是一块好表还是坏表？

这完全取决于它是为什么而造的，它是为了什么？一旦你开始说，这是一个好人吗？这是一个好的人类吗？你无法回答这个问题，除非你问，人类是为了什么而存在的？他们意味着什么？

人类生命的意义是什么？我们为何在这里？什么是重要的东西？你无法从科学中回答这个问题。你无法。

有印度教的答案，有佛教的答案，有个人主义启蒙运动的答案，有世俗的答案，有基督教的答案，有犹太教的答案，任何人说关于这是好行为、这是坏行为的话

行为，是嵌入在一个特定的世界观中的，一套信仰假设。任何人都不可能，如果你在任何公共场合说，没有人再知道如何获得洞见了。因为启蒙运动那种客观、中立、无立场的观点已经消失了，每个人都反对这种理解。因此，作为基督徒，我们必须有一种方式，即使在公共教育中，也能说，这是基督教的运作方式，这是犹太教的运作方式，这是印度教的运作方式，并与我们的学生讨论这些。基督教，只要被拿来比较，总是显得相当不错。

它有很多伟大的践行者，比如马丁·路德·金，如果你被允许，例如，让他成为他真正的样子，也就是一位福音的牧师。我们有很多非常好的榜样，你可以发现，在某种程度上，如果你在一个更具福音派性质的教会，你总是与非基督徒一起工作，你总是对此感到兴奋，但你会想，我希望我在一个没有那么多流动性的教会，那里的人年复一年地在那里，我可以专注于门徒训练。换句话说，我曾在一些教会，我在弗吉尼亚有一个教会，那里从来没有人离开，也从来没有人来，我能够做很多门徒训练和深入的神学教育，但我，我对传福音和接触外界有一种热情。我认为，如果你在公共教育，或者如果你在基督教教育，通常你会发现，你完成的事情是不同的。你会发现一种能让你更多地交谈、接触人的环境，但你总是觉得，我的手有些被束缚，我不能完全走到我想去的地方，而在基督教教育中，你经常会觉得这有点像温室。

所以我真的不知道哪一个是理想的，我认为我们需要两者兼顾，任何人如果给人这样的印象，说每个人都应该离开公立学校去基督教学校，那是错误的。因为我正在做这件事

今年学习箴言之后，我现在大概明白了学校的目标应该是智慧，也就是帮助孩子们理解生活如何运作，人心如何运作，这样他们就知道如何做出正确的选择，即使在道德规则不适用的领域也能做到。我认为有趣的是，这可以是公立学校的基督徒教师和基督教学校教师都可以尝试做的事情，他们的做法会有一些不同。话虽如此，斯科特，你想问你的问题吗？实际上，我想问，谢谢。既然学校还没有阅读，据我所知它们仍然对信仰怀有敌意，为什么家长要把他们的孩子交给一个如此敌对的学校系统，特别是考虑到即使孩子在基督徒家庭中长大，也许知道福音，或者接受了基督，他们的信仰仍在形成中，还不够坚韧，他们还不能独立站立。

为什么家长要把孩子交给这样一个机构，而他们消除这种灌输的机会仍然有限呢？我认为这个问题，由于我不相信中立性，我不相信有这样的东西，正如我刚才所说，因此我对把我的孩子送进基督教学校的想法有很多同情，我的孩子们在基督教学校读书，这样说吧，他们从中受益。我在纽约发现，真正反基督教的学校是私立学校。换句话说，是巴克利和查平，而不是布朗克斯科学高中或斯蒂文森特。我认为公平地对待非基督教学校，我们需要做出这种区分。

我看到了巨大的差异，现在我发现郊区的公立学校经常在想，你要么有世俗的人，要么有基督徒，这些疯狂古怪的基督徒。在这个城市里，公立学校的教师要应对印度教徒、穆斯林、佛教徒、犹太人、基督徒、东正教基督徒和天主教基督徒，我发现他们非常谨慎，令人难以置信地尊重。例如，每年在罗斯福岛小学，我都被邀请

和一位拉比以及一位神父一起进来，我们进来谈论圣日，因为那位公立学校的犹太教师，我所有的孩子都经历过她的课，她说，看，我真的希望他们理解这些不同的观点，她说，我甚至在努力确保不让他们认为我相信这些都是相对的。即使她是世俗的，但她说，我意识到从某种意义上说，她明白如果我只是说，好吧，有这个观点和那个观点，这不是很美妙吗？每个人都有自己的宗教，它们都同样有效。

即使这样说实际上也是一种极权主义的观点。就是这样。尽管她永远无法说那是启蒙主义的观点，但她以某种方式理解到，那是在把世俗主义凌驾于其他宗教之上。我想在某种程度上，她很害怕，她害怕某个愤怒的印度教徒、穆斯林或基督徒家长进来尖叫。我猜在纽约，每个人都会尖叫，所以我发现公立学校对不同的宗教非常尊重，并不那么敌对。

似乎甚至有一种直觉的理解，即使是世俗主义也不能强行灌输给这些孩子，否则他们的父母会让他们的老师不得安宁。我想让你们知道，当涉及到这个城市里一些所谓的精英私立学校，很多人想把孩子送到那里，他们公开地充满敌意。我不是在开玩笑。他们乐于拆解任何关于权威或道德的传统理解。因此我认为你应该做出区分。

这是第一点。不过第二点，我很高兴我的孩子们，我认为那两个既上过公立学校又上过基督教学校的可能都受益了。我认为，如果他们一直在基督教学校或一直在公立学校，我看到了其中的一些优势。所以我不知道这能告诉你什么，我只是一个摇摆不定的查理·布朗式的人。但我认为你确实需要非常仔细地观察，因为我认为斯科特的问题是对的。

如果你，我在和家长们交谈，我会

说你真的需要了解你的学区或当地学校有多大敌意，或者老师们的观点是什么，因为你真的没有权利抛弃我。圣经申命记第六章说，父母们，你们要对孩子的成长负责。我不能把这责任推卸掉，我是说我可以把日复一日的实际教学工作委托给别人，但我不能推卸责任。据估计，我们大多数人醒着的时间有一半都花在工作上。圣经的智慧如何应用于我们的职业？

换句话说，我们的工作如何与神的工作联系起来，我们的职业如何变得更有意义？在他的书《每一份好工作》中，提姆·凯勒汲取数十年关于职业和呼召的教导，向你展示如何在服事神和他人的过程中，从工作中找到真正的喜乐。这本书对基督徒的工作观如何成为蓬勃发展的职业和平衡的个人生活的基础，提供了令人惊讶的见解。《每一份好工作》是我们对你馈赠的感谢，以帮助福音与生命向世界各地更多的人分享基督的爱。请访问 gospelandlife.com/give，就是 gospelandlife.com/give。

最近我在阅读《纽约时报杂志》时注意到一件事，我相信托尼作为记者也注意到了，记者们在撰写热门话题的文章时，越来越不再表现得像全知全能、客观无所不在的叙述者，而是会声明自己的立场在哪里。有趣的是，上周日《纽约时报杂志》封面故事关于职场中的信仰的这篇文章，记者做得很好，他坦率地声明：这是我的观点。这是我的宗教观点。尽管如此，我会尽力保持公正，并承认这边的优势。

我认为这越来越可行了。你必须，我知道会有某些，你必须小心某些老师和某些其他家长。所以我会非常小心，但我

我相信你会越来越发现，如果你说，好吧，这就是我的立场，我们都有自己的立场，为了完全透明起见，我只是想让你知道这是我的观点，但我真的能够欣赏你的观点。现在，我认为这是可能的。我认为即使在10年前你都做不到这一点，但我认为人们会越来越认识到，我们都嵌入在道德共同体中，我们都嵌入在信仰共同体中，即使是世俗人士也有一种信仰。

重要的不是你是否提出真理主张，而是你如何对待持有不同观点的人？我认为你必须说，问题不在于我是否相信这个，而在于我如何对待其他人，我想表明我真的尊重他们，我也希望你帮助我理解你的观点，也许这会改变我看待事物的一些方式。所以我认为你可以更加开放。但我担心的是，要小心，你知道，不要说，哦，提姆·凯勒说了，然后你回去下次你进行家长面谈时，你说，顺便说一下，我是重生基督徒。但这需要与主题相关。

你不能只是说，我想让你知道，提姆，我的牧师告诉我，我可以这样做，它需要与主题相关，但如果确实与某事相关，说出来并不是坏事。其他人。我在竞选期间做了大量关于宗教问题的民意调查，实际上本市一些受人尊敬的新闻机构有一种不感兴趣的态度，直到周二晚上7点左右，我的邮箱被淹没了。我们一直以来，那种转向了垂死的道歉，对不起，我们没有发表你写的任何东西，但现在我们永远不会认为，但你确实会看到变化，但我认为，一个弱点是，如果我们处于这样的位置，那就是在教师的研究生和本科教育中，我们实际上没有为信徒提供太多工具，让他们能够以一种明智的方式将他们的信仰融入他们的教学和教育理念中。所以戴上你的帽子，你被邀请来哥伦比亚大学师范学院，给我一些

改变设计以增强信徒的教育体验，这些信徒越来越多地出现在我们的门口。

你知道，我认为你对这里的动机保持怀疑是公平的。我的，你知道瑞克·伦斯，你知道他是谁，在戈登康威尔教书，他说，我想他在这点上可能是对的，他说，因为在世俗社会中政治就是一切，因为权力就是一切。现在，突然间每个人似乎都在想，哦，宗教对于当选很重要。所以我们有，我想凯瑟琳这周刚告诉我，说有很多人突然会说，我们得弄明白这个，我们得弄明白这个，我们得理解这个现象，宗教，尤其是正统宗教，我们得弄明白它，弄清楚它的运作方式，也许学会如何瓦解它，也许削弱它或者以某种方式利用它，弄清楚一种方法，你知道，如果有人来说，我们想做个报道，因为我们了解到你是一位基督徒学校老师，我们想，我们正在做一个关于在公立学校的基督徒的报道，对所有这些要小心一段时间，因为我担心我不想只是成为一个标本，人们当然，我想也许所有，我想我们无论如何都是，但我会小心，我会小心动机是什么，我想利用你来向我们展示如何向福音派基督徒营销。所以假设他们是认真的，他们说，你知道，我们不是真的，你知道，我们很多学生抱怨或说他们没有真正得到智力上的发展，因为他们内在的从未完成，那你会建议什么？

是的，我想我可能会，有一本新书，你知道，我做什么，有一本尼古拉斯·沃尔特斯托夫的新书叫《为沙洛姆而教育》，尽管它主要是关于，他在耶鲁教了多年，刚刚退休，坚定的基督徒，荷兰加尔文主义者那种凯伯尔式的神学家，他写了，实际上是一堆关于，主要是基督教教育的文章，但他会说，例如，托尼，有一个古老的神话

普遍性的，我只是一个人，你知道，我不是从任何特定的角度出发，我只是告诉你事实，他说有一种坚固的、僵化的特殊主义，它只是说，我有真理而你没有，我有圣经而你，你是唯一的，然后他称之为可接近的特殊主义，也就是说，让我们都摊开来，让我们把事实摆到桌面上来谈，我，我们所说的是嵌入在各种信仰叙事中的，让我们来谈论它，让我们试着互相学习，让我，让我，让我，因此让我实际上给你我的基督徒经济学方法，弟兄姐妹们，你们对教育改革有什么问题吗？我想对其他所有人提问，但在这里，你想鼓励每个人吗？正在创造的空间，如果有人读过托马斯·塞尔乔瓦尼的著作，我建议你去查阅他，因为有趣的是，系统中正在发生的张力，有这种教导、教导、教导的焦点，托马斯·塞尔乔瓦尼是教育领域最受尊敬的人之一，教育委员会付钱请他来这里，所以当他来演讲时，我坐在我的一位东正教犹太同事旁边，我们听了他的整场演讲，在场的都是教育局的高层人员，非常有趣的是，他概述的一切都完全是关于基于信仰的社区，但谈论的是这确实是学校作为组织应该有的方式，所以，但每个人，哦，那太好了。他对圣经的了解足以引用，实际上，在他的写作中，他确实引用了圣经，所以我只是，我猜我很好奇，因为随着学校改革，正在发生的事情以及对学术界和校长所做事情的许多批评是，他们试图把商业策略直接套用到教育上，所以我猜，塞尔乔瓦尼提出的主张是，学校更类似于教会和社会组织，所以我想我的问题是，教会生活和其他社会组织的哪些要素是我们可以用来帮助改革学校的，而不是

现在正在发生的事情，你知道，如果某种方法在商业领域有效，整个杰克·韦尔奇的那一套，你知道的，就直接套用到教育上。好吧，你知道，你刚才抓住了重点，因为我在一秒钟前开始回答一个问题。那就是，好吧，我不是教育工作者，我不知道所有的这些张力在哪里。

我理解为什么我们在教会里也有一点这样的问题，例如，当我们考核那些想要被按立为牧师的传道人时，最简单的方法就是我们给他们这个，我们给他们一个非常大的，我们这样做，我们是长老会的。所以，你知道，你必须掌握这么多的教义，我们在教义上给他们非常详细的考试，但你真正想要评估的是，他们知道如何，他们的临床方式是什么样的？他们知道如何激励人们想要信神、认识基督吗？而这是无法量化的。这不容易量化。要找出这个人是否真的能成为那样的福音传道人要难得多。

我想要的是，我能够系统地创建一个，你知道的，一种生产流水线，就是测试和分数，而且，你知道，你在神学上得了这个分数，在圣经上得这个分数，在教会历史上得这个分数，在这个上得这个分数，嘿，他们得了97分。再说一次，我们都知道，当然，你可以在所有的科目上得到97%的分数，却成为一个糟糕的传道人，正如你们都知道的。那么你如何评估呢，不幸的是，一旦你谈论到品格和智慧，我不知道该怎么做，除了说，你必须，你必须创建社群，由社群来集体评估人，你知道，你必须，实际上看到一个孩子在学校表现得更好，对学习表现出兴趣，与同学相处融洽，这并不难，我不知道，你能稍微量化一下吗？通常成绩会提高，是的，你可以量化，某人是完全可量化的吗？也许，不，可能不是，所以我想也许你必须做的是，你必须，我不知道这是怎么运作的，但你必须尝试去争取让学校不要那么以考试分数为导向，这就是我能告诉你的全部，我，而且这不是

运动，对吧，但这个运动完全是朝着相反的方向发展。嗯，我想说的是，他们两边都在说，因为这是指导性的，指导性的，就是说钱花在了，你知道，引进像谢尔盖·阿瓦尼这样的人，他们传递的信息恰恰相反，他说，你知道，孩子们在外面创造社会资本，如果你不允许他们在学校里创造，那么他们就会自己创造，这就是为什么我们会有这些问题，我们有充斥着暴力的学校，你知道，这正在推动这个城市的大量讨论，关于影响学校、学校里的警察，所以这有点，你知道，但是人们，这就好像我们对此保持沉默，他们知道什么是有效的，我和这里的老师们进行过交谈，我看到这里有些人，他们的课堂在绝对混乱的环境中运作良好，原因就是我们正在谈论的这些，但你被告知，好吧，这真的是关于工作本身，所以有一种不言而喻的，所以，我猜问题的一部分也是，你在多大程度上提到它的真正原因，因为我的学校正在好转，为什么我有五条规则，其中一条就是以你希望被对待的方式对待别人，我明白这并不能解决我作为家长无法做到的长期问题，但它至少确立了，你明白吗，但这一切就好像，遵守黄金法则，你在表达它，你在明确地表达，你基本上是用黄金法则来评判孩子们，但这不是可以被测试的东西。对，是的。

但它最终会影响考试成绩，比如，你知道，你会说到什么程度，因为那些运作良好的课堂，当人们问为什么，他们发现，通常是一位使用这种理念的老师，这不是关于他们使用的教学方法，所以你会在多大程度上让人们参与到这个讨论中？嗯，尽你所能，因为你不觉得，在某些情况下，你的上级会直接把你的头拧下来，如果你在其他地方，就不会，试着把自己放在一个你认为有可能的地方，你知道，公共的，就像一个游泳池，

你们的公立学校系统有好的地方和差的地方，尽量进入好的地方，并推动你知道的正确方式。有问题吗？好的。我有一个问题。

哦，我们还有另一个问题。不好意思。是的。作为一名基督徒管理者，你如何看待我们在领导学校和作为社区一部分时所扮演的角色？你知道，在许多学校，人们进来又出去，和社区没有任何互动，我认为我们有责任，作为基督徒教育工作者和管理者更是如此，那么你如何看待我们的角色？

是的。你说得对。说服人们相信这一点是你的工作。这里有一本书推荐。我想最后看起来相当悲观，但我从中获益良多。

我的一个朋友写了一本书叫《品格之死》，作者是詹姆斯·亨特，实际上是关于道德教育的。他的基本观点很难反驳，也许你可以从这本书中获得一些东西来用在你的教师身上，他说社区塑造品格。他说案例研究做不到这一点。他说社区塑造品格，在那里孩子们看到某些行为榜样，他们看到人们说同样的话。如果老师们不互相交流，你们每个人都是独立运作的，只是个企业家，你们根本不是一个社区。

重点是品格是由社区塑造的。它不是，你不能在课堂上被塑造。你不能，你知道，你给出很棒的案例研究。这是正义。这是公平。

这是爱。这是耐心。但除非他们看到公平、爱和耐心被示范出来，他们不会学到它。而且他们必须看到它以这种方式得到肯定和强化。所以如果你的老师不相信它，在某种程度上，你的老师相信它，并且在某种程度上你使它成为一个社区，在这种程度上才会是一个有效的学校。

我知道这是一场大战。你们想要有人提问吗？我在南布朗克斯教高中，幸运的是布朗克斯的每个人都知道他们需要上帝，或者某种东西，所以他们让我为他们的孩子祷告。我真的没有问题。我在公立学校教书。

但是当你

让自己恢复活力？因为作为一名教师，我已经感觉到，而你也是一名教师，我的意思是，你带着你的，对吧？你很强壮。我是一名教师。对。

好的。好的。谢谢。其实是一名教育工作者。作为一名教育工作者，你休这个学术假期，对吧？

你在夏天休这段时间，我想知道，你做什么，你的哪些部分，在做了这么多年之后，你感觉哪些部分被耗尽了，因为这终于是我的第二年。你知道上帝需要在你身上做什么工作吗？因为我觉得今年夏天，我又教书了，我没有休息，但我感觉有点，你知道，我是说感到疲惫不堪，所以你做什么，经过这么多年你是怎么做到的？是的。好的。

嗯，我必须，正如你们一些人，如果你们在数的话，我实际上有两个月不讲道。在其中一个月里，我实际上在写作，我决定尝试每年整理一本书，或者如果我，我不是说我每年都能写一本书，但我在努力，我在努力写一本书，努力用一个月的时间创作一本书。这样做的一个好处是，这实际上是相当艰苦的工作，但不是和人们在一起，而是更多的研究，我通常从写书的工作中为我的讲道获得大量的想法。我做的第二件事是用一个月的时间，我休整整一个月的假期，但在那个月期间，我可能会将我的祷告量增加三倍，比如我尝试每天祷告两到三个小时。听起来像是，哇，多么有灵性啊，哇，我的意思是，我在阅读，你知道，我在读圣经，这不像我只是坐在那里看，看着，我不会看着云彩看三个小时，我，你知道，我使用公祷书，我，你知道，你知道，阅读默想性的信件和讲章，学习圣经和祷告。

实际上，另一件事是，我有大约12个人，我不是说人，真的，就像夫妻，我认识很多很多年的人，是我可以放松的人，我可以信任的人，我可以分享的人，分享我所面临的事情，我确保我能见到他们。实际上，我尝试

如果可能的话，我会和他们一起度假。所以这是一个月非常密集的与人相处、祷告的时间。还有一个月实际上也相当密集，实际上，我喜欢这一周，这一年，剩下的一个月，写书的那个月是我实际上有更多时间工作，比我一年中其余时间准备讲道时更多，因为你知道，我每周有那么多时间，因为我很忙，我在外面，做像这样的事情。所以这真的是，真的像在象牙塔里待一个月。

然后真正地与人在一起并祷告一个月。但顺便说一句，改变就像休息一样好，但你确实需要，如果我只是讲道，我过去，我过去，我过去做的是我会去度假，人们会说，哦，当你在，在记忆中，你能在这里讲道吗？我过去会那样做。那不是个好主意。你必须让土地，活着，休耕一段时间，否则你，它，它会枯竭，最终你再也榨不出任何东西了。

好的，就这些。是的，请讲。晚上好，祝福你，嗨，大家好。我一直在服务不足的学校工作。我开始在东纽约工作，然后转到南布朗克斯。

我做的是所谓的整合调动，需要多元化的学校。嗯，今年九月是我第一次去弗吉尼亚的第二学区，现在我就在21街和1街，主要是白人和亚裔学生，也有一些西班牙裔和黑人。但在其他学校，那些服务不足的学校，你可以自由地教你想教的东西，使用你想用的书。而在这所学校，一切都非常严格，我们必须教，《释放巨人》《人鼠之间》。我对一些文学作品有困难，因为，你知道，《人鼠之间》里有很多专业性，我不想在课堂上见到很多这些书。

我想要一些建议。不，你是说，你是说你想要一些帮助，你知道，如何，如何教它，还是你只是不知道，你必须读某些书和某些书。你必须大声朗读。

我感到自在，是的，但我对说出某些书籍感到不自在，某些书籍在哪里呢？嗯，我知道这就像，我知道这，我知道这，我知道这，我知道这，我知道这听起来像是牧师应该回答的问题，但我，我会直说，在我看来，当你作为一名教师在做这件事时，我的意思是，基督徒演员们问过我类似的问题，而且只会更糟。

他们说的是，好吧，我是一个基督徒，现在我被要求去表演并说一些我，你知道的，我使用粗话或者实际上以某种我并不真正认同的方式行事。我说，好吧，如果你读圣经，圣经里有很多可怕的事情。圣经中有些地方谈到一些非常糟糕的事情，事实上，有很多，很多时候你知道这一点，因为我在礼拜中说过这个，翻译有时会净化希伯来语和希腊语实际所说的内容。它在告诉你事情实际有多糟糕的故事。人们真的会这样说话。

人们真的会做这些可怕的事情。这不是，你甚至不想去看那些东西，但文学作品的目的就是要把它揭示出来。所以我会说，大声说出来并没有什么错，因为从某种意义上说，当你在阅读它时，你就是一个演员。你在扮演一个角色。这不是真正的你。

你是在向孩子们传达这本书的内容。他们当然听过粗话。他们生活在纽约市。但我总是告诉他们，你知道的，在这种情况下我不对他们说脏话。是的。

你说得对。不，不，不。是的。我想我应该这样说。我这样做是为了这本书，但我不想听到任何人在我面前这样说话，我也不这样说话。

好的。是的。好的。换个话题，我想问你一些关于疲惫的问题，接着你刚才所说的。我度过了一个非常愉快的暑假，我完全放松了，我满怀热情地开始新学年，但一周之后。

我已经感觉太累了，什么都做不了，我认为教学的困难之一就是你永远无法到达终点。永远没有一个终点

你会觉得，好的，我已经做完了所有需要做的事情，就这样，我可以关机了。但批改作业一直在继续，甚至不仅仅是这样，还有在脑海中不断回顾课程，根本无法关掉工作状态，周末来了，整个星期天都在批改作业和备课。所以，举个例子，当礼拜时间从9点30改到10点30时，我很恼火，因为这意味着我回家更晚了，能做的学校工作就更少了，但我的意思是，看起来我无法控制这种情况，我已经教了15年书了，每年我都对自己说，我要达到一种平衡，但从来没有实现过。所以我只是……

你几点到家？你晚上工作吗？我每天早上大约6点45分到学校，晚上大约7点到家。然后周末也要工作。你晚上做事情吗？

不。是的。想想这个。我曾是……我一直都是……

我一直倾向于过度工作，我这辈子大概每周工作75到80个小时，作为一名牧师一直都是这样，但是这里是……如果你想想你的……你有七天，除非你把早上、下午和晚上分开来想，诚然如果你的晚上从7点开始，这有点……我是说，这还可以。你仍然有大约三个小时的时间段。

所以你有早上……所以你有21个时间段，对吧？七天，乘以三？我不是数学专业的。数学老师，7乘以3乘以1是多少？

好的。你有21个时间段。确保无论如何你要休息7个时间段，在这些时间段里你不教学，不备课，7个时间段。那么我一直能够做到这一点。我必须每周休息一天，两天，那就是3个时间段。

这意味着在某个地方我必须休息一个下午和一个下午，以及另外三个晚上，因为我有时晚上外出，有时晚上工作。如果你能休息7个时间段，你就能坚持下去。我已经这样做了相当长一段时间，我的孩子们，出于某种奇怪的原因，并不记得我是一个缺席的父亲，这仍然是我不知道我是怎么躲过这一劫的。关键是你在哪些时间段休息那7个时间段，如果你有

孩子们。只要确保让自己有安息日，同时也要做一些与工作无关的阅读，确保在这方面有纪律性，并说我每周至少要有两到三个小时的阅读时间。

也许甚至每天晚上一个小时，读一些与你工作无关的书，总是会让你感觉自己有更多的生活。只是几个想法。21个中的7个。好的，丽贝卡。我实际上告诉我的老师们要回家，我也回家，因为这件事，这个参考是我们谈论的关于保持新鲜感，为他们提供想法，以及情绪上的休息，在我看来，这比你准备的实际课程更能让他们受益。

所以你可能甚至没有意识到当处于高压情况时你是如何无法互动的。所以你必须退出来，你不是你的工作。我对我的老师们说，你是希拉里，你是一名教师，但你不会成为你的工作，尤其是作为一个基督徒，你有一个更容易的方式来让自己扎根，并说这就是它的终点。如果你有一些想法闪现，我知道这种情况经常发生，你知道，起床把它们写下来，然后就放下它，因为这是不可持续的。我认为你必须记住，最终他们得到的是你带给它的精神。

如果你筋疲力尽，并且没有用对你有益的东西来补充自己，无论是健身房还是其他什么，那么这会表现出来的。这里还有其他人想说些什么吗？你就是不要在夏天工作。好吧，无论你的财务状况如何，不要在夏天工作。凯瑟琳，我们还能再问一两个问题吗？

好的，请说。我曾是一名教学研究员，在那两年里，我感觉就像一场赛跑，到了第二年我说，我受够了，我要离开我的学校去一个更大更好的地方。但实际上，我在布朗克斯教书，实际上是家长们说服我留在我的学校。你知道，出于所有伟大的原因。所以说到这里，丽贝卡，你知道，用了一些关于

黄金法则，教授黄金法则。

我在布朗克斯的教室里有26个幼儿园的孩子，我们所做的就是向他们教授黄金法则，让他们学会彼此相爱，彼此友善。但是当这些孩子回到家里，面对那些显然不与老师沟通、教导完全相反的东西的父母时，你该怎么办？因为我们在课堂上确实做得很好。教室里没有暴力。但是在操场上，为什么你打那个孩子？

因为我妈妈告诉我，如果有人打我，我就打回去。所以这是超越教室、超越你作为教师角色的事情。你如何处理这个问题？你不能去对一个家长说，你必须实践黄金法则。那么对这些家长有什么实际的方法呢？

教师们。我举办家长教育工作坊。我们在10月2日做的其中一件事，珍妮特也参加了，我们做的是，我们邀请了家长和一个社区组织，一次集会，我们举办了戏剧工作坊、舞蹈工作坊和绘画媒体工作坊。我们把它办成一个家庭日，在那里我们与家庭共度时光，我们邀请孩子和家长一起来我们学校。我认为这是一个管理层面的能力，你需要去找你的管理者，让他们创造性地思考，不要只是坐着开家长会。

事实上，其中一位家长在会议结束时说。我们进行了汇报，他们对我说，这太令人耳目一新了，以前每次我去参加家长会，管理者所做的就是对我大吼大叫，你知道吗？而我的想法是，我对对人大吼大叫这种事不感兴趣。我想让他们坐下来，真正地与他们的孩子一起做活动，我们也邀请了员工来做这些活动，但我认为你需要去找你的管理者说，我在这里遇到了一个问题。我们能否集思广益找到解决办法？

我认为你需要在你的社区中不同的时间整体性地做这件事。我所在的地方有一个困难的人群。我这里的家长也有很多你所说的同样的问题，而且还是在高中。顺便说一句，作为校长，你可以这样做，虽然，

因为她作为教师做不到这一点。她可以去找校长。

好的。是的，这个问题。但是，我的意思是，我的校长就是这样做的。我们举办周六研讨会、家庭工作坊，但这些家长不来。他们不来参加这些活动。

他们不来参加家长会。当你打电话给他们时，他们不来，他们不接电话。而且，你知道，我想留下来，我想这样做，我想与这些在孩子学校生活中缺席的家长合作。所以作为一名教师，我能做些什么去主动接触这些家长？什么方法有效，这就是我生活的写照，我今天已经开了四个小时的会议，试图解释同样的一些事情。

如果你非常，如果你用逻辑来解释，也就是说，我理解在街上，因为这正是，我的意思是，我的孩子们被围殴，他们害怕坦白是谁在做什么？因为他们离开学校时会被围殴。这非常严重。有帮派成员。我的意思是，我知道这是我们很多人都有的同样故事，但解释是学校。

当你进入学校的门，校园就是学校，那是你责任的一部分。课间休息时发生了什么？所以我还没有遇到一位家长不同意这一点，而且我有，我有家长把它写下来，写成文字，我告诉他们要还手，就是让你知道。但一旦你与他们交谈，你作为教师可以这样做，也就是，我如何保护你的孩子？如果你告诉你的孩子要还手，而他告诉他的孩子要还手，然后每个人都在打架，当我对他们说，我不想你僭越你的权威。

他们总是尊重这一点。我不想你僭越你的权威，但我无法保护他们。如果下一次是你的孩子，而他们的家长也说了同样的话怎么办？所以当他们走进学校大门时，我们必须以不同的方式运作。我对他们说，我不能告诉你在街上该做什么。

我理解那是一个不同的问题，但在学校大门内，如果你能帮助我们，对孩子说，给老师和工作人员机会，给我机会来保证他们的安全。是

你说的是这个意思吗？是的。好的。管理人员确实会这样做，你知道，即使在今天，我了解到有一些类似的情况，家长实际上试图打另一个学生，管理人员必须介入，让家长意识到，你希望我们为你的孩子做什么？

我认为一旦你把问题带回到家长身上，让他明白他的孩子可能会成为下一个受害者，他们确实会退后一步，更理性地思考。这在逻辑上符合流程和后续跟进，他们通常会回到正轨。还有什么好的答案吗？请讲。你能听到我说话吗？

有一件事是，你知道，这在与教育工作者的所有对话中都是一种潜流，作为教师，试图实施来自管理层和公立学校教师的教育局的宏观愿景，我曾经是一名教师，所以我理解这一点，但在硬币的另一面，我现在在教育局工作，我只是想让你们所有人知道，今晚能来到这里对我来说是非常鼓舞人心的。无论如何，教育局有人每天都在为你们所有人祷告。这可能很难相信，但是……我当然要说，我会感激，我们都会，好吧，我会感激你们的祷告。然后我想快速问你们一个问题，当我还是一名教师时，我既在公立学校工作过，也在布朗克斯和曼哈顿的教区学校工作过，有几次我真的能够向你传达一个信息，上帝在某种程度上向我展示，我与家长互动的方式，或者我在某种情况下的态度，完全被他作为基督徒赐予我的恩典所浸透，抱歉，我有点激动。

所以我对你们所有人的问题是，也许你们可以从自己作为教育工作者的经历中分享一个小小的轶事，当时你只是说，天哪，如果我没有这种世界观，我无法处理那件事。我先开始。我们谈到我们祷告，我们许多人祷告，我们说如果不祷告我们无法开始一天的工作，无论是阅读圣经，还是在学校或与他人一起，因为每天我到达学校时，这是

带着一种冒险的心态，因为我们永远不知道，你知道，你有最好的计划，每个人都应该在岗位上，然后一个孩子跌倒受伤了。我们有一个轶事，一个幼儿园的孩子在院子里摔倒，他们以为她只是撞到了下巴，但当她去看医生时，她的下巴骨折了，她的下巴必须用钢丝固定，这让人胆战心惊。当那位家长来的时候，你该如何对她说话？

在那种情况下你该对家长说什么？家长会如何反应？所以总是带着这种祷告，家长来了，管理人员在那里，我们与家长交谈，有时他们来的时候很有敌意，有时他们有问题，只是需要有人倾诉，当我们对他们说话时，祈求圣灵将正确的话语放在我们口中，家长有时会变得非常平静，或者那位家长可能只是哭泣，或者我们只需要一个拥抱，我们有这样的例子：孩子的父母正在死去，他们知道自己在死去，他们有关于我的孩子会怎么样的问题，只需要一个拥抱，然后当那位家长离开时，他们感觉好多了，或者情况平静下来，我们说感谢上帝，你知道，上帝真好，我们一直这样说，因为我们对如何面对那种情况没有想法或计划，所以这种事情我认为在我的学校几乎每天都会发生。回到June几分钟前提到的家长问题，实际上就在我来这里之前发生了，我说我花了很多时间调查游戏相关的事件，实际上今天学校安保人员不得不护送两位家长离开，因为他们在谈话中非常愤怒，我想说实话，你的第一反应可能是，我无法完成调查，因为你因为你的行为而不得不被护送出去，所以也许我就直接记录为这件事确实发生了，而不去追究真相，但我坚持了一整天的剩余时间，我又给家长打了电话，这真的不是我认为在来这里之前应该做的事，并且在上次会面的方式之后试图保持积极的态度

了，但我告诉了她调查的状况，她的儿子实际上并不是参与这起事件的当事人之一，她说，马龙女士，我整天都感到非常难过，我只是想向你道歉，所以我就知道，在那种情况下，能够给她回电话，这不是——这只是神的恩典赐给我的，在经历了两三个人离开之后，我知道这完全是恩典。

你正在试图重新编织一些你知道需要彼此关联的事物，但它们并没有关联起来，这非常非常非常令人沮丧，但你们是基督徒，你们知道这意味着什么，这意味着最终你想看到发生的事情将会发生，最终将会有和平，最终将会有公义，最终将会有完整的家庭，最终你不会有父母去世，你将会有一个重新编织的创造，神会成就这事。我的意思是，有很多工作比你的工作更令人满足，因为你制造一些东西，你把它做好，然后你把它送出去，人们购买它，你赚到钱，你回家，你的产品是改变生命、成熟和智慧，因此你总是对你的产品不满意，我的意思是，它从来都不是你想要的样子，这非常非常令人沮丧，但你们是基督徒，你根本不是在打一场必败之战，所有悲伤的事情总有一天都会成真，所以你站在正确的一边，你必须活在那种盼望中。现在让我们祷告。

天父，我们感谢你呼召这个房间里的我们成为教育工作者，你呼召我们进入一份看起来如此混乱的工作，它不像生产一件机器然后销售它，不像许多其他工作，在那些工作中，产品是可量化的，底线是如此容易掌握、推动和识别。我们谈论的是改变生命，我们谈论的是学习智慧，我们谈论的是成熟，我们谈论的是人们成为真正的人，这似乎是一个无止境的、也许是注定失败的事业，但它不是，我们知道它不是。

因为基督徒的缘故，我们感谢你，感谢在这个房间里的男男女女，他们以各种方式成为你医治世界、修复和重新编织你创造的代理人。感谢你，复活的耶稣向我们证明，有一天你将完全实现我们最深切的愿望，让我们看到我们的城市完整，这个家庭完整。因此感谢你赐给我们的这段时间，继续成为我们伟大的老师，奉耶稣基督的名祷告。阿们。
