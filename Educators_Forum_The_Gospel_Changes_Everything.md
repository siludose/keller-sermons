Yeah, I was actually a real-life formal teacher for five years at Graduate School Seminary  actually lectured and I created tests and I graded tests and papers for five years.  I said, get me back in the ministry where you can teach and teach you nobody knows whether  the people are learning or not.  It's wonderful.  There's no way to find out.  It seems like so, took all the pressure off.  Let me, let, yes, okay.  Let me suggest, the only book that CS Lewis ever wrote on public education, that's what this  book's supposedly about, the abolition of man, little booksy, short books, the sort of thing  that everybody wants.  Let me share two thoughts from the book.  If you are a teacher and have never read it, or if you haven't read it in a long time,  I suggest you read it because it is about education.  The first essay is called Men Without Chests, very famous and in it, he takes a book that  was written at the time, I guess, in the 1940s, a book that was supposedly a textbook for  English literature for high school students, what we call high school.  And in the book, there's this great quote here, that Lewis quotes.  He says, the textbook says, when people say a waterfall is sublime, they think they are  saying something very important about the waterfall, but they are only saying something about  their feelings about the waterfall.  And Lewis pointed out that this is the very essence of modern, this is the essence of  modernity.  This is the essence of modern Western culture.  What they were saying is, if you talk about an objective fact, something that can be  proven, something that's empirically investigatable, that's a fact.  But if you say anything that can't be proven empirically, if you say adultery is a sin,  or I believe in God, or a waterfall is sublime, you're just talking about feelings.  It's subjective.  It's not really important, David said.  And Lewis points out, this is the essence, and this is if you're a public school teacher,  this is the essence of your problem.  That you're allowed to talk about, supposedly, you're allowed to talk about anything that's  subjective, empirically proven, something that can be rationally investigated.  But when it comes to moral values, religious beliefs, I believe in God, I think adultery  is wrong.  Whenever you get into anything that can't be proven, that's subjective.  That's supposed to be kept private.  You're not allowed to talk about that.  It's of course a big hot issue, but in politics, am I allowed to bring my moral views into  the public realm?  Some people say, no, of course not.  You don't bring your religious or moral views into the public, into politics.  There we only talk about what's reasonable and rational, not what you think is your moral  values.  Lewis responds by saying, if you really believe that everything is relative, and it comes  to morality, he has this very famous place where he says, he says, if you're actually  educating students in this way, if you're actually educating students to believe,  that things that are objective, fact, are one thing.  But all moral views, all views about morality, religion, or anything like that is completely  subjective, completely to be kept private.  Completely relative, that is, to your individual consciousness or to the culture you're  in.  He says, you realize what's going to happen, and this is the quote that ends that essay.  He says, you can hardly open a periodical without coming across a statement that our civilization  needs drive or more self-sacrifice.  In a sort of ghastly simplicity, we remove the organ and demand the function.  We make men without chests and expect to them virtue and enterprise.  We laugh at honor and our shock to find traders in our midst.  We castrate and bid the gildings be fruitful.  And what he's really saying is, if you really say everything is relative, except that which  is empirically proven, self-sacrifice, why be self-sacrificial?  Why care about the common good?  Why be a good citizen?  Why?  He says, you can't educate people like that.  So what's the answer?  He actually brings out something called the Dow.  And what he means by the Dow, T-A-O, taken by way from the Chinese idea that there is a  kind of, it's natural law.  He says he believes that, and most all religions believe, that the religions actually differ on  many things like how you're saved.  All human beings have some basic understanding of God and some basic understanding of right  and wrong that we kind of know intuitively.  And Lewis makes a case that on the basis of that, what Catholics would call natural law  and what Protestants would call common grace.  On the basis of the fact that people know some things intuitively, you can educate and  you can appeal on the basis of this understanding that there's such a thing as common grace.  Now, what do I mean by that?  It's actually very important for both people who are in Christian schools or private schools  as well as public schools.  And I'm here, by the way, I'm giving you a more Protestant view of natural, long common  grace.  The Protestant view is if you have a thin understanding of sin that is just breaking  certain rules, you should make that more robust, a thick understanding of sin according  to the Bible, a thick, robust view of sin, is that sin is making anything more central  than God.  Sin is idolatry.  So nationalism and making your family or making your moral record or making doctrinal  purity, the thing that makes us better than everybody else.  Those are all forms of idolatry and self-righteousness, but of course materialism, sex, power, aggressive  violence.  They're all idols.  And so a robust understanding of sin is not just your breaking rules because as you know,  the Pharisees were horrible sinners because they were terribly self-righteous and filled  with pride and were terrible people, even though they were being all the rules.  Secondly, if you want to understand natural law and common grace, you have to have a thick  understanding of grace.  And here's what I mean by a thick understanding of grace.  You need to understand that in Romans chapter 1, verse 18 to 25, we read this.  I can find it.  It says yes.  Romans 1, 25 says, since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities have been clearly  seen being understood from what has been made, so men are without excuse.  Now what's that saying is all human beings basically know the golden rule, basically  know we must not be selfish, basically know we should care for our families, basically  know a right and wrong, but they repress it.  But what's interesting is the verbs are being understood, are being seen, are present  passive participles.  And what that means is that at any given time, every human being on the face of the earth  is experiencing, in their innermost being, a dialogue between what they know about God  and what they know about right and wrong and their own idolatrous hearts.  So every cultural product, every poem, every work of art, every essay, every op-ed piece,  everything that is ever produced has, is a result of that dialogue, which means that  if you're, if I'm a Christian and I'm producing a cultural product, which is a sermon by  the way, that there's idolatry in it, there's something wrong with it, there's idolatrous  discourse in it.  I'm in some way, I'm never quite hitting it just right, I might have pride in my own  perspiterianism, I might have just a lack of humility in the way in which I speak.  I mean, in other words, there's both truth in what I'm saying and idolatry.  But in non-Christians, according to Romans 1, people who even overtly say they're not,  they don't believe in God, when they produce movies, when they produce films and they produce  art, when they produce essays, there's always some witness to God's truth in there.  It shows there's good things being stated by non-Christians all the time because of common  grace.  And C.S.S.L.S. says, you have to understand common grace, you have to have a robust view  of sin and a robust view of grace if you're going to educate, and here's the reason why.  If this is the case, this is one of the reasons why when I get asked this question, it's  hard for me to believe that Christian education, Christian schools, or public education, Christians  and public schools is, it's hard for me to believe that either one of those is the only  way to go.  It's hard for me to believe that's the only way to educate people.  It seems to me that if you're in a Christian school, I did have, as you're going to hear  in a minute, I've had my children everywhere, which shows a lack of discipline or a lack  of cohere in philosophy or maybe I have some other reasons, but it's not hard for me  to see that when I put my kids in Christian schools very often they come out with some ways  in which they're learning the Bible.  You can see idolatrous discourse, you can see rigidity, I've never forgotten my first  grade son comes home from his Christian school in Hope, Virginia, and he says, we were praying  for the children in public schools today, why?  Because they can't pray and their faith is being assaulted all the time, it's first  greater.  While there's some idolatrous discourse in that, okay, that's all.  On the other hand, in the public school, here you're going to be having to educate not  by quoting the Bible if you're Christian, but by appealing to natural, uncommon grace.  You have to expect that, first of all, people who aren't believers or who are believers  and other religions are going to have some understanding of the truth, you know, just  to give you a real example, obvious example, rape.  Almost everybody thinks rape is wrong, why?  Can you prove it scientifically?  Absolutely not.  Is it rational, well, it's practical, but there's no rational or empirical way to prove  that rape is wrong.  Why don't we all think rape is wrong?  Why is it enshrined in our legislation?  And why can we say, in a public school room, that rape is wrong?  Do you realize that's a value?  That is a faith bleep.  That is something we believe is wrong, but we could never prove, but common grace and  natural relation, no matter almost who we are, we all intuitively know it.  Now what you have to do is you have to find those other places, you have to reason on  the basis of natural, uncommon grace, and lastly, just to code here, one of the things  that's important to realize is increasingly, though I need some of you are going to say,  I don't see it, okay, but I see it.  Increasingly it's going to be harder and harder for public schools or in fact for our public  institutions to keep maintaining this difference between fact and value.  More and more people are recognizing that everything you say is based on faith assumptions,  like I just gave you the example of rape.  When someone says, we all know rape is wrong, why do we know rape is wrong?  That's an act of faith.  That's a moral judgment.  And when someone says, you can't bring your moral judgments into the classroom, you have  to realize everybody's doing that.  Everybody is saying, on the basis of my understanding of the nature of reality, on the basis of my  understanding of the story that I think we're all in, there's an individualistic enlightenment  story that says there's really no truth except human rights and we also be free to decide  what is right around for us, but that's a story.  That's a way of understanding all of reality, it's a world view, it's a faith thing, you  can't prove that.  And if you're a Christian teacher, whether you're in private schools at our Christian or  your public schools at our Christian or your Christian schools, it's going to be increasingly  important and possible to show your students that everything that every statement practically  comes embedded in a moral view of the world view, and you have to identify it as such.  So you know, you say Martin Luther King Jr. worked for civil rights because why did he  do it?  Did he say, everything is relative and every individual has to decide what is right  of frame or hurt?  He said, because the Bible says so, he did do that, he said, let justice roll down.  He was an African-American Protestant, and within his understanding, the reason, as you  know, I guess the reason that black activists went into civil disobedience as opposed to  what their white liberal friends said in the 1950s, was their white liberal friends were  humanists who didn't believe the human beings were sinful.  But the black activists who were reading Reinhold Niebuhr and the Bible, they did know that  human beings were sinful, and they were never going to, that the Americans, white Americans  would not give up power unless they were pushed, and that they wanted to do it in a way that  was still Christian and loving, so they did civil disobedience, peaceful civil disobedience.  You have to show that what Martin Luther King Jr. did came out of a particular understanding  of human nature and of God and of right and wrong, because everybody who says anything, even  people who believe in human rights, that comes out of an enlightenment view of what life  is like.  Increasingly, you're going to be able, you're going to have to tell people these stories and  let your students recognize how every moral claim, every claim of any sort is embedded in  a worldview.  You have to be able to say that, increasingly, the people at the top, the philosophers know  there's no such thing as reason that is just unembedded in a particular understanding  of ultimate reality, and increasingly, you're going to be able to do it too.  So on the basis of common grace, on the basis of this understanding of things, I actually  think that it means those of us in Christian education, like me, have to recognize the limited  nature of our Christian education.  Those of you who are Christians in public education have to realize, I think, real possibilities  for instructing people in wisdom, and maybe increasing possibilities in talking openly  about various faith views.  So now, I've saying that because my guess is that when I get these questions now, I'm  going to tend to refer to this basic insight that comes from the abolition of men.  Okay?  So I'm supposed to lead for the next 45 minutes.  Well, I'm supposed to take questions and I think what this means is panel.  You're supposed to shoot me questions about, first of all, what kind of school, private,  public, Christian, home schooling, isn't that right, Catherine?  Let's try, let's shoot me questions about that for a while, and I'll try to make answers,  and you can maybe respond, and then I'll start to.  I think when we talk about choices and philosophy, what really comes down to is how we live  all lives and where we place our children and where we choose to live.  So I know from a long term relationship with you, actually, your youngest son went  to a Bronx science and he had a math tutor who was a teacher to Christian school that I  was running at the time.  Right, my oldest son went to public school all the way through.  All the way through.  New York public schools.  New York public schools.  But I know for sure that you sent your other children right to Christian boarding schools.  And my question that I had for you was how you've gone to that process, why, what the  difference was in the choices, why you made those choices, and going back on reflection,  how would your advice parents today to live their lives with their children?  Okay, there's two questions.  First would be, why did I do what I did?  My three sons, we've been here almost 16 years, well, over into our 16th year, our oldest  son went through public school all the way.  Our other two sons went to public school, Michael, my middle son went to public school until  ninth grade and I sent him to Stony Brook, which is a Christian boarding school without  one and a half away.  And my youngest son, Jonathan, went, I think, till fourth grade to public school, from  fifth grade to eighth grade, went to a Catholic school, so I'm really diverse, by the way.  And then went, and then he went to Stony Brook, the Christian boarding school as well.  Number one, I really mean it.  My wife, I talked about, make sure my wife and I were still in agreement on this before  I came.  Is that we really do see advantages to the various forms of education.  We do not, and I would be disappointed if Christians didn't vigorously go into every  one of these kinds of education, private, Christian, private, and public.  I think we can do a huge amount of good and renewal in each one of them.  And that's why, because I had no philosophical problems with any one of them, we were free  to choose the one that we thought fit the kid.  We didn't have a problem with Christian education or problem with public education, therefore  we were able to make a choice.  If he had gotten into towns and Harris, we might have kept him here.  He tried to get into towns and Harris, but in hindsight, we really made the right choice  because he would have been living at home and that wasn't the best thing for him.  Jonathan just insisted he wouldn't want to go to Stony Brook, too.  And when we looked back on it, we're still not sure it was the best idea, but it was  also... we thought it was okay, and so he did it because he really, really wanted.  And this is, by the way, those of you who are parents as well as teachers know, this  is how you do this.  You do it on a case-by-case basis.  Now, if we thought public school was no good, or Christian schools, no, no, no, none of that,  we would have not been able to have all those options, but we have.  In fact, by the way, on top of that, my sister, my dear sister, I love to the sky, is the  best home schooler I know.  She's home school.  A lot of people believe it or not.  You say, well, not only all of her five children, but everybody else's children in the neighborhood,  I think.  And it's been... so I've gone all around the block.  What would we say today to... I would say the same thing, just to parents who are Christians  that you do have a number of options and that you really ought to do it on a case-by-case  basis, and I would actually hope that Christians would somehow be well-distributed.  I do think we actually need to need more Christian schools in a city than we've got.  I also think we need Christians to be much more actively involved in the public schools  and renewal of the public schools.  I would like all the thousands of flowers to bloom.  I really think it's really possible.  I think because a lot of us... it's hard... if you're into public schools as a teacher,  I hope you'll feel like this is the... there's nothing wrong with you feeling like your  approach is the superior one.  If you don't feel a little... I mean, I like to... there's this really odd tension.  I want to feel... I want everybody on my staff to feel like there's no church-like redeemer.  You know, you've got to feel like this is the greatest church.  You have to be careful about that because it's more emotional than it is intellectual.  You stand back.  You have to say no, wait a minute.  There are a lot of other great churches.  So you should feel the same way if you're into public... if you want to create great  Christian schools for the city and you define that and you really want to do that, that's  all right for you to feel like this is my passion, this is what I want to do.  And to feel like... I want to recruit as many people into that as possible, and vice versa  for public schools as well.  So that's the reason why I... we have to do a case-by-case basis.  Okay, other questions?  I just want to give a little background.  I'm not a product of Christian and public schools, so I think not only what fits the... what  fits the child, but different times in the child's life, so I think you know, that's  very important.  I also just want to kind of make a point about why I'm sitting here as an administrator,  as a direct result, Catherine mentioned that I'm in the Leadership Academy.  The reason I'm in a Leadership Academy to make a very long story short is from a conversation  on a site visit that Chancellor Klein had to a school that I was working at in East Flatbush,  a failing school teacher there, and I couldn't wait till he got there to tell him everything  that was wrong and to talk about, how can you let children live in these conditions?  So anyway, out of that conversation, and he said, well, how did you get the students  to read?  Their older siblings can't even read.  And so did you do this?  And did you do that?  And was it where you went to graduate school?  And was it that?  And I said, actually, it's about creating a caring community for us.  So every day in my classroom, I start with morning meetings and we talk about what it means  to treat each other the way we want to be treated.  And I went through this whole thing, expecting him to, you know, run away, because that  has nothing to do with the reform effort that they were moving in terms of the unified  curriculum.  And actually, his response was he listened for about 30 minutes and he said, can you please  email all of that to me?  And I thought, well, you know, that's just some kind of, you know, let me make her feel  good.  She gave me all this garbage or whatever.  But is the conversation went on?  He said, as a matter of fact, I really need you to apply for this program.  And I said, which program?  And he said, the leadership academy, and you know, nothing about it.  And I said, oh, no, I want to be a teacher.  I have no interest in administration.  And he said, I know, that's exactly why I need you there.  So what I ended up emailing him was a policy memo, basically entitled transforming New York  City Schools with the Golden Rule.  And no doubt about it, that's been the voice that I've brought to the leadership academy  and that I'm trying to bring to this school.  So I just want to say that that is very true that there's so many opportunities.  And we're in such a crisis in public education that I'll be honest with you.  They don't really care where you say it comes from as long as it works.  So what goes hand in hand with that is the quality.  You can't go around and say I'm a Christian, I'm a Christian, and yet you're doing substandard work  and too often that becomes a crutch.  So I just want to re-emphasize that this is, you know, and for all of it, you know, not talking about politics.  There is an open opportunity to impact the schools.  That's my context for the question that I agree with Tim.  What I do have a problem with is that the loudest voices in Christianity today seem  to be people that are anti-public schools and anti-having Christian students and public schools.  And I do believe that there's different settings for every child.  But I just want to read a statement that kind of set off my whole concern.  This is by Mr. Rae Moore, who runs an organization called the Exodus Mandate  that are asking all Christians to remove their students from their children from public schools.  The quote is, a movement to purge the public schools of Christian children  would literally electrify and invigorate the church as nothing has done in modern times.  And might trigger the revival we are all awaiting so expectantly.  So that, and that's actually has supportive Dr. James Dobson of Kennedy.  So this is what's circulating.  And I'm, you know, maybe not here, but in other places in the country.  So I guess my question is, and I have asked this also to an email kind of dialogue with Mr. Moore,  especially in a city like this in a crisis.  We can all acknowledge the crisis situation.  What do we as Christians?  What is our responsibility to students in the public schools?  And what are the ways that we can work together to bridge this divide between homeschool,  private school, Christian school, as in church, you know, so I don't know if that's a question.  No, it is.  Let me, I'll say something.  I want to make sure Scott or somebody asked me a question about Christian school,  if you will, I mean, so I, so the other shoe drops.  But let me just say something good about, well, no, here.  Should we just plant new churches?  Or should we renew the churches that exist in a city?  Now, I've done a lot of thinking about that since I'm a church planter.  And it is fairly easy when you plant a new church to give the impression or maybe even believe  that all the other churches around here are dead and this just won't work.  So we have to start a new church that's really on fire.  Now, the fact is that a city will not be reached for Christ only by new churches.  There's tons and tons of people that will go to the existing church and only to the existing  church.  The older church, the church that, you know, their parents and their grandparents were at,  it's only going to read.  That's the only way that a whole lot of people are going to be reached by the existing  churches, the established churches, the older churches.  It's also true that unless you start new churches, the older churches don't sometimes  get, get pricked into making changes.  We really found it when Redeemer got started.  We started doing a lot of stuff that the other churches and towns that would never work.  It did work at Redeemer.  Next thing you know, they started doing it in the older churches.  There actually is therefore a need for something like a Christian school movement and there's  no doubt that there's a lot of schools that are outside of the public school system that  can do things that the public school system can learn from.  You've got to have renewal like that, but you also have to renew one of the public schools  too.  You just can't abandon all the students in public schools.  So I know the way to reach a city is to not only plant new churches, but to renew the  old churches.  It's not any other war at all.  Over the years there have been church planters who are like this people in this petition  or this movement.  They're really saying the existing church is just a whole lot of crap and it's going to  hell in the hand car.  We're just forgetting about it and everybody should come out and join us because we're  the true new church.  It never works.  It creates friction, sectarianism, so you just have to have both as simple as that.  I think that would be the thing to say.  I really do believe there's going to be an opening more and more for Christians who  are careful.  Not being sectarian, understanding common grace and natural law.  There's going to be a way for us to be able to talk in public settings about the faith  basis for what we're saying because what you have to say, everybody's got one.  So, when you come and say this, look, that's a faith, there's a faith basis to that.  You have to explain everybody, so reason for this is out, let me just finish this one.  Alistair Macinty wrote a book in 1984 called After Virtue.  It's had a huge impact on the thought life, especially the philosophy world.  He said you can never talk about something being good unless you ask, answer the question,  what is it for?  So, he may have heard me use this illustration.  You can't say whether it's a good watch unless you ask, what is it for?  It's lousy for pampering nails, by the way, if you've ever tried.  But it's wonderful for telling time.  So the question is, is it a good watch or not or is it a bad watch?  It all depends on what it's built for, what's it for?  As soon as you start to say, is this a good person?  Is this a good human being?  You can't answer that question unless you ask, what are human beings for?  What are they mean?  What is the meaning of human life?  What are we here for?  What is the important stuff?  And you can't answer that question from science.  You can't.  There's a Hindu answer, there's a Buddhist answer, there's an individualistic enlightenment  answer, there's a secular answer, there's a Christian answer, there's a Jew, anybody  who says anything about this is good behavior, this is bad behavior, is embedding it in a  particular worldview, a set of faith assumptions.  There's no way that anybody can, if you say that well, in any public setting, nobody  knows how to gain sight anymore.  Because the enlightenment idea of some kind of objective, neutral view from nowhere is  gone, everybody has been against understanding that.  There's got to be a way for us as Christians, therefore, even in public education, to say,  here's the way the Christian thing works, here's the way the Jewish thing works, here's  the way the Hindu things work, and talk about it with our students.  Christianity, whenever it's compared, always looks pretty good.  It's got a whole lot of great practitioners like Martin Luther King Jr., if you're allowed,  for example, to make him what he really was, which is a minister of the gospel.  And there's, we have an awful lot of really great examples, you can, I find in some way,  if you're in a more vangelic church, where you're always working with non-Christians, you  always are so excited about it, but you wonder, I wish I was in a church where there wasn't  as much transience, and there was, the people were there from year to year, and I could  work on discipleship.  In other words, I've been in churches where every, I had a church in Virginia, where nobody  ever left, and nobody ever came, and I had a lot of, I was able to do a lot of discipleship  and deep drill down theological education, but I, I had a passion for evangelism and reaching  out.  And I think if you're in public education, or if you're in Christian education, you're going  to find, in general, that you get different things done.  You're going to find one that enables you to kind of talk more, and reach out to people,  and yet you always feel like, my hands are somewhat tied, I can't completely go down where  I would like to go, and very often in Christian education sometimes you feel like it's kind  of a hot house.  So I just don't know the one is the ideal, and I think we've got to have both, and anybody  who gives the impression that everybody came out of public schools and wanted to Christian  schools, that would be wrong, however.  Because I'm doing this thing on Proverbs this year, I now understand probably what the  goal of a school would be, would be wisdom, which is helping kids understand how life  works, how the human heart works, so that they know how to make right choices, even in  areas where the moral rules don't apply, that would be, and I think that what's interesting  is that could be something to both public school teachers, who are Christians, and Christian  school teachers could both be trying to do, they're going to go bad a little bit differently.  Having said that, Scott, you want to ask your question?  Actually, I do, thank you.  Since the schools are not reading yet, and that they are still to my understanding hostile  to the faith, why should parents put their children in the hands of a school system that  is so hostile, especially in light of the fact that even if the child is growing up in  a Christian home, is aware of the gospel, perhaps, or the accepted Christ, their faith  is still being formed, that it's not yet resilient, they can't stand on their own.  Why would a parent turn their child over to such an institution when their opportunities  to unwind that indoctrination is still limited?  I think that is, since I don't believe in neutrality and I don't believe there's such a thing,  as I just said, therefore I have a lot of sympathy for the idea of putting my kid in the Christian  school, my children who were in Christian school benefited from it, put it this way.  I have found in New York that the real anti-Christian schools are private schools.  In other words, Buckley and Chapin, not Bronx Science or Stivocent.  I think to be fair to non-Christian schools, we need to make that distinction.  I've seen a huge difference, and now I found the public schools in the suburbs very often,  and they're thinking, you either have secular people or Christian people, these crazy  nutty Christians.  Here in the city, the public school teachers are dealing with Hindus and Muslims and  Buddhists and Jews and Christians and Orthodox Christians and Catholic Christians, and I  found them incredibly careful and unbelievably respectful.  For example, every year, and in Roosevelt Island Elementary School, I was asked to come  in along with a rabbi and along with a priest and we came in and we talked about the Holy  Days because the Jewish teacher that public school teacher taught all of my kids all went  through just said, look, I really want them to understand these different points of  view, and she says, I'm even trying to make sure I don't let them think that I believe  that they're all relative.  Even though she was secular, but she said, I realize in a sense that she understood that  if I just said, well, there's this view in this view and isn't it wonderful?  Everybody's got their own religion, they're all equally valid.  Even to say that is actually a totalitarian point of view.  That's it.  Even though she could never say that's an enlightenment view, she understood that in a way  that was putting secularism over the other religions.  And I think to some degree, she's scared, she's scared of some angry Hindu or Muslim or Christian  parent coming in and screaming.  And I guess in New York, everybody screams and so I found that public schools were extremely  respectful of the different religions and weren't that hostile.  And seemed to even have an intuitive understanding that even secularism couldn't be pushed down  the throat of these kids, or else their parents were going to take their teachers' heads  off.  I want you to know that when it comes to some of the quote unquote elite private schools  in the city, where a lot of people want to send their kids, they're there's overtly  hostile.  And I'm not kidding.  And they delight in dismantling any kind of traditional understanding of authority or morality.  And therefore I think you ought to make a distinction.  That's the first thing.  Secondly though, I was kind of glad that my kids, I think the two that were both in public  school and Christian school probably benefited.  I think that then if they had been in Christian school all the way or had been in public school  all the way, I saw some advantages of that.  So I don't know what that tells you, I'm just a wishy watchy Charlie Brown guy.  But I think you do have to watch very carefully because I think Scott's question is right.  If you're, I was talking to parents, I would say you really need to know how hostile  or what your school district or your local school is like or what your, what the teacher's  views are like because you really don't have the right to abandon me.  The Bible, Deuteronomy 6 says, parents, you are responsible for your children's upbringing.  And when I can't delegate that away, I mean I can delegate away the actual day in and  day out work of teaching to somebody else but I can't delegate away the responsibility.  It's estimated that most of us spend half of our waking hours at work.  How does the wisdom of the Bible apply to our careers?  In other words, how can our work connect with God's work and how can our vocations be more  emotional?  In his book, every good endeavor, Tim Keller draws from decades of teaching on vocation  and calling to show you how to find true joy in your work as you serve God and others.  The book offers surprising insights into how a Christian perspective on work can serve  as the foundation for a thriving career and a balanced personal life.  Every good endeavor is our thank you for your gift to help gospel and life share Christ's  love with more people around the world.  Visit gospel and life dot com slash give that's gospel and life dot com slash give.  Now here's Dr. Keller with the remainder of today's teaching.  One of the things I've noticed in reading New York Times magazine recently, I'm sure  Tony being a journalist has noticed this, that increasingly when reporters are doing when  they're writing articles about hot topics, instead of acting like they're the all-knowing  objective omnipotent omnipresent narrator, they are making disclaimer of what where their  own position is.  It was interesting this article on faith in the marketplace, it was in the cover story  of New York Times magazine last Sunday.  The report did a great job and he came out and said in full disclosure disclaimer, here's  my view.  This is my religious view.  Nevertheless, I'm going to say this, I'm going to try to really be fair-minded and recognize  the advantages over here.  And I think that's increasingly possible.  You have to, I know that there would be certain, you have to watch out with certain teachers  and certain other parents.  So I would be very careful, but I bet you increasingly, if you say, well, this is where I'm coming  from, we're all coming from someplace and I just want in the interest of full disclosure  that you know that this is my viewpoint, but I really can appreciate yours.  Now, I think that therefore is possible.  I don't think even 10 years ago you could have done that, but I think increasingly people  are going to recognize that we're all embedded in moral communities, we're all embedded  in faith communities, that even the secular people is a kind of faith.  What's important is not do you make truth claims, but how do you treat people who have  different views?  And I think that you have to say, it's not a question of whether I believe this or it's  how I treat the others, and I want to show that I really respect and I also want you  to help me understand your viewpoint and maybe this will change some of the ways in which  I see things.  So I think you can be more open.  But I'm afraid of, be careful, you know, don't say, oh Tim Keller said, and then you go  back and you next time you have a parent interview, you said, by the way, I'm a born again  Christian.  But it needs to be relevant to the subject.  You don't just say, I want you to know, Tim, my pastor told me, I can do this, it needs  to be relevant to the subject, but if it is relevant to say something about it, it's  not bad.  Somebody else.  I do a lot of polling and religious issues during the campaign, and there was a sort  of a disinterest actually among certain esteemed journalistic organs here in the city until  about 7 o'clock on Tuesday evening, my mailbox was flooded with co-house.  And all we had been, the sort of turned on a dying impologies, I'm sorry, we didn't publish  anything, you wrote, but now we will never think, but so you do get changes, but I do, the  one weakness is that if we're in such a position is that in graduate and undergraduate  education for teachers, we don't actually provide too many tools for believers to be able  to work out their faith in an intelligent way into their teaching and in their educational  philosophy.  So put on your hat, you're asked to come to Teachers College at Columbia and to give  me some advice of changing the design so that you can enhance the educational experience  and of believers who are increasingly appearing at our gates.  You know, I think it's fair to be as suspicious as I think you are about motives here.  My, you know Rick Lens, you know who he is, teach the Gordon Conwell, he told, I think  he's probably right about this, he says, because in secular society politics is everything,  because power is everything.  Right now, suddenly everybody seems to think, oh, religion is important for getting elected.  So we have, I think Catherine told me this just this week, says there's an awful lot  of people are suddenly going to say, we got to figure this out, we got it, we got to figure  this out, we got to understand this, this phenomenon, religion, and especially orthodox religion,  we got to figure it out, figure out what makes it tick, maybe learn how to dismantle it,  maybe weaken it or maybe use it somehow, figure out a way to, and you know, if somebody  comes and says, we want to do a story because we understand you're a Christian school teacher,  and we want to, we're doing a story on Christians who are in the public school, be careful  about all of that for a while, because I'm afraid I don't want to just be a specimen,  that people certainly, I guess maybe all, I guess we are anyway, but I would be careful  about, I'd be careful about what the motivation is, I want to use you to show us how to market  to evangelical Christians.  So let's say they're serious and they say, you know, we're not really, you know, a lot  of our students complain or say that they don't really get, really intellectually developed,  because they're inside of them is never done, so what would you suggest?  Yeah, I think I probably would, there's a new book by, you know, what I do, there's a new  book by Nicholas Woolworth's store called Educating for Shalom, even though it's mainly  about, he's taught a Yale for years, he just retired, strong Christian guy, Dutch Calvinist  kind of Kaipirian theologian, and he's written, it's actually a bunch of essays on, it's  mainly Christian education, but he would say for example, Tony, there's the old myth  of the universal that I'm just the human being, you know, I'm not coming from any particular  perspective, I'm just telling you the facts, he says there's a, there's a solid, cystic  kind of particularism where it just says, I have the truth and you don't, I have the Bible  and you're, you're the only, and then he calls what he calls accessible particularism,  which is to say, let's all get out, let's get out on the table, the fact that I, what  we're saying is embedded in various faith narratives and let's talk about it and let's  try to learn from one another and let me, let me, let me, therefore let me actually  give you my Christian approach to economics, brothers and sisters, have you got questions  on the education reform?  I'd say question for everybody else, but here, would you like to encourage everyone,  the space that's being created, if anyone has read Thomas Urgeo-Vani, I urge you to look  him up, because the interesting, the tension that's going on in the system as well, there's  this instruction, instruction, instruction, focus, Thomas Urgeo-Vani is one of the most revered  people in the field of education and the board of education pays him to come here, so when  he comes to talk, I was sitting next to an orthodox Jewish colleague of mine and we listened  to his entire speech, which was all of the top brass of the DOE and it was so funny that  everything he outlined was completely about faith-based communities, but talking about  how this is really the way schools as organizations should be, so, but every, oh, that's wonderful.  He knows just enough scriptures to put in, actually, in his writing, he does reference  scripture, and so I'm just, I guess I'm curious because with school reform, what's  happening and a lot of the criticism of the academy and things that the chancellor is  doing is that they're trying to take business strategies and just dump it on top of education,  so I guess, and Sergei Ivani was making the claim that schools are more akin to churches  and social organizations, so I guess my question is, what are some of the elements of church  life and other social organizations that we can use to help perform schools as opposed  to what's happening now, which is, you know, if it works in business, the whole Jack Welch  just, you know, drop it on education.  Well, you know, I, you were right in picking up, because I started answering a question just  a second ago.  Is that, well, I'm not an educator, I don't know what all the tensions are.  I understand why we have a little bit of this problem in the church, for example, when  we examine ministers who are coming in who want to be ordained ministers, the easiest  way to do it is we give this, we give them an enormously, we do this, we're presbyterians.  So, you know, you have to master this much doctrine, and we give these very detailed  exams on doctrine, but what you really want to assess is, do they know how to, what's  their bedside manner like?  Do they know how to inspire people to want to believe in God and to know Christ and that's  not quantifiable?  It's not quantifiable easily.  It's much harder to find out whether this is a person who really can be a gospel minister  like that.  I want to, the way I can just systematically just create a, you know, kind of a production  assembly line is tests and scores, and, you know, you got this score on theology, this  score on Bible, this score on church history, this score on this, and hey, they got 97.  Again, we all know, of course, that you can get 97% on all the scores and be a terrible  minister, as you all know.  So how do you assess it, unfortunately, as soon as you're talking about character and wisdom,  I don't know how to do it, other than to say, you have to, you have to create communities  who evaluate people communally, you know, you have, it's not actually not that hard to  see of a kid is doing better in school, is showing an interest in learning, is relating  well to his classmates, I don't know, can you quantify that a little bit, usually the  grades go up, yeah, you can quantify that, somebody is it completely quantifiable, is  it, maybe, no, it's probably not, so I think probably what you have to do is you have  to, I don't know how this works, but you have to try to argue for letting the schools  do not be quite as test score oriented, that's all I can tell you, I, and that's not  the movement, is it, the movement's all in the other direction.  Well, it's kind of what I'm saying is that they state they're speaking both ways, because  it's instruction, instruction, that the money is, you know, spent to bring in people  like Sergi Avani, who are giving exactly the opposite message, who says that, you know, kids  create social capital outside, if you don't allow them to create it in their schools,  then they'll create it on their own, and that's why we have the problems, we have a school  of violence, which you know is, you know, driving a lot of the conversation in the city  with the impact schools, police officers in schools, so it's kind of, you know, but people  that, it's kind of as if we'll be quiet about that, they know where it's working, and  I've had conversations with teachers in here, I see some people out here where their  classrooms work in the middle of absolute chaos, and the reason is because of what we're  talking about, but you're told, well, it's really about the work, so there's kind of this  unspoken, so it's, I guess part of the question too, is how much do you reference the real  reason for it, because my school is turning around, why I have five rules, one of them  is treat others the way you want to be treated, I understand that's not addressing long-term  things that I can't do as a parent, that it's at least establishing, you understand  so, but it's all just as if, keep in the golden rule, you're making it, you're making  explicit, and you're basically judging the kids on the golden rule, but that's not something  to be tested.  Right, yeah.  But it ultimately impacts test scores, like, you know, how much do you say, because the  classrooms that are working, when they ask why, and they find out, it's typically a teacher  who's using that philosophy, it's not about the instructional approach that they're using,  so how far do you go and engaging people in that?  Well, as far as you can, because don't you think, in some case, your superior will just  take your head off, if you're in other places, it won't, try to put yourself in a place  where you think that there's, as you know, the public, it's like a swimming pool, your  public school system has got hot spots and cold spots, try to get into a hot spot, and  push what you know is the right way.  Take questions, right?  Okay.  I have one.  Oh, we have another one.  I'm sorry.  Yes.  As a Christian administrator, what do you see all roles in terms of how we lead our schools  and as part of a community?  You know, many schools, people go in and they come out of the Dan, there's no interaction  with the community, and I think we have a responsibility, and more so as Christian  educate and administrators, and so what do you see all roles?  Yeah.  You're right.  It's your job to convince the people of that.  Here's a suggestion of a book.  I guess in the end it looks pretty pessimistic, but I got a lot out of it.  A friend of mine wrote a book called The Death of Character by James Hunter, and it's actually  about moral education.  And his basic point, which is kind of hard to argue with, maybe you could get some stuff  out of the book to use on your teachers, is to say communities create character.  He says case studies don't do it.  He says communities create character where the kids see certain behavior models, and they  see people saying something of the same thing.  If the teachers don't talk to each other, each one of you is an independent operator, just  an entrepreneur, you're not a community at all.  And the point is the character is formed by the community.  It's not, you can't be formed in a classroom.  You can't, you know, you give great case studies.  Here's justice.  Here's equity.  Here's love.  Here's patience.  But unless they see equity and love and patience modeled for them, they're not going  to learn it.  And they have to see it affirmed and reinforced that way.  So if your teachers don't believe it, to the degree, your teachers believe it, and  to the degree you make it a community, to that degree will be an effective school.  I know it's a big fight.  You want to have people ask questions?  I teach high school in the South Bronx, and luckily everyone in the Bronx knows they  need God, so, or something, so they let me pray for their kids.  I don't really have an issue.  I teach in public school.  But what do you do when you rejuvenate yourself?  Because as a teacher already, I feel like, and you are a teacher, I mean, you come back  with your, right?  And you're real strong.  I'm a teacher.  Right.  Okay.  Good.  Thank you.  An educator, really.  Like as an educator, you take this sabbatical, right?  You take this time in the summer, and I want to know, what do you, what parts of you do,  you feel depleted after doing this for many years, because it's finally my second year.  And what parts do you know God needs to work in you?  Because I feel like this summer, I taught again, I didn't take time off, but I'm feeling  kind of, you know, I'm saying worn down, so what do you do, and have you come about after  a number of years?  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, I have to, as you prop, some of you, if you're counting, I actually take two months  away from preaching.  And what I'm doing for one of those months is I'm actually writing, I decided to try  to pull together a book each year, or if I, I'm not saying I can write a book every  year, but I'm trying, I'm trying to write a book, trying to work on a book for one month.  One of the advantages of that is it's, it's actually fairly hard work, but it's not  out with people, it's, it's more research, and I usually get terrific amount of ideas  for my sermons from working on the book.  The second thing I do is for one month, I take a whole month off as vacation, but during  that month, I, I probably triple my amount of prayer, like I try to do two or three hours  a day.  It sounds like, wow, what a spirit to go, wow, I mean, I'm reading, you know, I'm reading  the Bible and it's not like I'm just sitting there looking, looking at, I don't look at  the clouds for three hours, I, you know, I use the book of common prayer and I, you  know, you know, read meditative letters and sermons and study the Bible and pray.  And I actually, the other thing is, I've got a, probably about 12 people, I don't mean  people, really, like couples, people that I've known for many, many years, are people  that I, that I can relax with, people that I can, can find in, people that I can share  with, what, what I'm facing, and I make sure I get around to them.  Actually, I try to take vacations with them if I possibly can.  So it's a, it's a, it's a whole month of very intensive people, time and prayer time.  And one month of very, actually, fairly intensive, actually, what I like about the week,  the year, what's left month, the month of working on a book is I actually have more time  to work than I can, working on my sermons for the rest of the year because I, you know,  I have so much time every week because I'm busy, I'm out, I'm doing stuff like this.  So it's, it's really, like, really in the ivory tower for a month.  And then really out with people and praying for a month.  But a change is as good as a rest, by the way, but you do, if I was just preaching, which  I, I used to, I used to, I, what I used to do is I used to go on vacation and people  said, oh, when you're in the, in the memory, would you please preach down here?  And I used to do that.  And that was not a good idea.  You have to let the land, live, follow for a while, otherwise you, it, it pleats and eventually  you can't get any more crumbs out of it.  Okay, that's a little bit.  Yes, go ahead.  Good evening, bless you, hi, everybody.  I've always worked in underserved schools.  I started out working in East New York and then I transferred to the South Bronx.  And I did what was called integration transfer, schools that need to be diversified.  Well, this September was my first time going to District 2 in Virginia, now I'm just  a 21st and 1st Street, some majority Caucasian and Asian students, there are some Hispanics  and blacks there.  But at the other schools, the underserved schools, you had the freedom to teach what you wanted  to teach and use the books you wanted to use.  And at this school, everything's very regimented, we have to teach, free the mighty of Mice  and Men.  And I'm having a hard time with some of the literature, because, you know, of Mice and Men  there's a lot of expertise in it, and I don't want to meet a lot of the books in class.  I want some suggestions.  No, are you saying, are you saying you would like some help with, you know, how to, how  to teach it or you just don't know, you have to read certain books and certain books.  You have to read it out loud.  I'm comfortable, yes, I'm not comfortable with saying certain, where are the certain  books?  Well, I know it's like, I know it's, I know it's, I know it's, I know it's, I know it's  like, it sounds like a sort of a pastor should answer, but I, I'll go out and say, it seems  to me that when you're doing it as a teacher, I mean, the, the, the Christian actors have  asked me something similar and only as worse.  What they say is, okay, I'm a Christian and here I am being called to act and say something  that I, you know, I use exploatives or actually act in a certain way that I don't really  agree with them.  I said, well, if you read the Bible, there's a lot of horrible things in the Bible.  If there's places in the Bible that talk about some pretty bad things, in fact, there's  a lot of, a lot of the, sometimes you know this because I say this in the, in the services,  the translation sometimes kind of, purify what the Hebrew and the Greek actually are saying.  It's telling you the story about how bad things really are.  People really talk like this.  People really do these awful things.  It's not, you don't want to have to even look at that, but the purpose of the literature  is to bring it out.  And so I would say that there's nothing wrong with you saying it out loud because in a  certain sense, you're an actor when you're reading it.  You're taking the role.  It's not who you really are.  You're getting the book across to the kids.  They certainly have heard the exploatives.  They live in New York City.  But I'm always telling them, you know, I don't swear at them in this case.  Yeah.  You're right.  No, no, no.  Yeah.  I think I ought to just say this.  I'm doing this for the book, but I don't want to hear anybody talking like this in my hearing  and I don't talk like this.  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  On a different note, I'd like to ask you something about exhaustion, just to follow  on from what you were saying.  I have a very good summer and I'm totally relaxed and I'm enthusiastic to start the year  and after a week.  It's already, I feel like I'm too tired to do anything and I think one of the difficulties  with teaching is you never get to an end point.  There's never a point where you feel, okay, I've done everything I need to do and that's  it and that I can switch off.  And the marking keeps coming but it's not even that it's the going through lessons in  my mind and continually not being able to switch off the job and the weekend comes along  and the entire, you know, Sunday is spent doing marking and preparing.  So when, for example, the services changed from the 930 to the 1030, I was annoyed because  it meant I got home later and couldn't do as much schoolwork, but I mean, it seems like  I can't get this under control and I've been teaching for 15 years and every year I,  you know, say to myself, I'm going to achieve a balance and it never happens.  So I'm just...  What time do you get home?  Do you work at night?  I'm at school at about quarter to seven every morning and I get home at about seven o'clock  in the evenings.  And then the weekends as well.  Do you work on things at night?  No.  Yeah.  Think about this.  I was a...  I've always been...  I've always tend to overwork and I've always worked probably about 75, 80 hours a week,  all my life as a minister and yet here's...  If you think of your...  You have seven days unless you think of morning afternoon and evening and admittedly  if your evening starts at seven, it's a little bit of...  I mean, that's all right.  You still have three hours or so of rooms.  So you have morning...  So you have 21 segments, right?  Seven days, three times?  I wasn't a math major.  Math teachers is seven times three times one?  Okay.  You have 21 segments.  Make sure that you take seven of them off under all circumstances that you're not teaching  and you're not working on lessons seven.  Then I have been able to do that.  I have to take one day a week off, two days, there's three.  And that means somewhere I have to take one afternoon and one afternoon off and three  other evenings off because I'm out evenings, I work evenings sometimes.  If you can take off seven, you can survive.  I have for quite a long time in my kids, for some strange reason, do not remember me being  an absentee father, which is still something I don't know how I dodge that bullet.  Caddies is where you take those seven if you've got kids.  Just make sure and sabbath yourself and also everything is do some reading that has  nothing to do with your job and make sure be disciplined about that and say I'm going  to have at least two or three hours a week reading.  Maybe even every night, an hour, some book that you're working through that has nothing  to do with your job always makes you feel like you've got more of a life.  Just a couple ideas.  Seven out of 21.  Yeah, Rebecca.  I actually tell my teachers to go home and I go home and because the thing, this reference  is what we were talking about to be fresh and to have ideas for them and to be emotionally  rested, that's what they're getting in my opinion more out of than the actual lessons  that you're preparing.  So you might not even recognize how you're not able to interact in the situations when  they're high pressure.  So you just have to step out and you are not your job.  I say that to my teachers, you are Hillary, you are a teacher that you don't become your job  especially as a Christian that's, you have an easier way to ground yourself and say this  is where it ends.  And if you get less than thoughts, I know that happens all the time, you know, get up  and write them down and then leave it because it's just not sustainable.  And I think you have to remember ultimately what they are getting is the spirit that you're  bringing to it.  And if you're exhausted and you're not replenishing yourself with what's great for you,  the jam or whatever it is, then it's going to show.  Anybody else here want to say something about it?  You just do not work in the summits.  And okay, what your finances are, do not work in the summits.  Katherine, can we still take a question or two?  Yeah, go ahead.  I was a teaching fellow and for the, that the two years and I was teaching fellow, I  felt like it was a race and I got to my second year and I said, I'm done, I'm going  to leave my school and go for somewhere a little bigger and better.  But it was actually, I teach in the Bronx and it's actually the parents that convinced  me to stay at my school.  And you know, for all the great reasons.  So with that said, Rebecca, you know, used that something about the golden rule, teaching  the golden rule.  I have 26 kindergartners in my Bronx classroom and all we do is teach the golden rule to them  about being loved one another, be kind to one another.  But what do you do when these kids go home to these parents who obviously are not communicative  with their teachers who teach the extreme opposite?  Because we do really well in the classroom.  There's no violence in the classroom.  But out on the playground, why did you hit that kid?  Because my mommy told me that if somebody hits me, I hit him back.  So this is something that goes beyond the classroom, beyond your role as a teacher.  And how do you address this?  You can't go to a parent and say, you got to practice the golden rule.  So what is a practical approach to these parents?  Teachers.  I run parenting workshops.  One of the things we did in October 2nd, and Janet was at the piece, what we did was,  we invited parents with a community-based organization, once convention, and we did  a drama workshop, a dance workshop, and a drawing of media workshop.  And we did it as a family day, where we called out time with the families we invited the children  with the parents to our school.  I think it's an administrative capacity, that you need to go to your administrator and  ask them to think creatively about not having a parent meeting where you're sitting.  In fact, one of the parents said it was at the meeting at the end.  We debriefed, and they said to me, this is so refreshing, whenever I went to a parent  meeting before, all the administrator did was bark pieces at me, you know?  And my deal is like, I'm not interested in doing things like barking at people.  I want them to sit down and actually do activities with their children, and we invited staff  to also do those activities, but I think you need to go to your administrator and say,  I'm having an issue here.  Can we brainstorm ways of solving that?  I think you need to do that holistically at different times throughout your community.  We have a difficult population in my place.  I'm with who have parents who have a lot of the same issues you're saying, and then  high school.  By the way, you can do that as a principal, though, because she couldn't do it as a teacher.  She could go to a principal.  Okay.  Yes, the question.  But, I mean, my principal does that.  We do Saturday workshops, family workshops, but these parents don't come.  They don't come to them.  They don't come to parent-teacher conferences.  They don't come when you call them, they don't pick up the phone.  And, you know, I want to stay and I want to do this, and I want to work with these parents  who are absent in their kids' school lives.  So what can I do as a teacher to go out there and talk to these parents?  What, one of the things that worked, and this is the story of my life, I've been in four  hours of meetings today trying to explain some of the same things.  And if you're just very, if you explain it logically, which is, I understand that on the  street, because this is exactly what, I mean, my kids get jumped, they're afraid to confess  who's doing what?  Because they get jumped when they leave school.  It's very serious.  There's bloods members.  I mean, I know it's the same story a lot of us have, but the explanation is school.  When you enter the door of school and the yard is school, that is part of your responsibility.  What happens at recess?  So I have not had a parent yet that doesn't come to the agreement, and I have, I have  had parents write it, put it in writing, I am telling them to hit back just so you know.  But once you have a conversation with them, and you can do this as a teacher, which is,  how do I protect your child?  If you're telling your child to hit back, and he's telling his child to hit back, and  then everyone's hitting, and when I say to them, I don't want to you serve your authority.  And they always respect that.  I don't want to you serve your authority, but I can't protect them.  What if it's your child the next time whose parents said the same thing?  So when they walk inside the school door, we have to operate differently.  And I say to them, I can't tell you what to do on the street.  I understand that's a different issue, but inside the school doors, if you could help us  by saying to the child, give the teachers and the staff the opportunity, give me the opportunity  to keep them safe.  Is that what you say?  Yes.  Okay.  Administrators do, you know, villains, even today I understand there were some situations  like that where a parent actually tried to hit another student, and the administrators  have to step in and make the parents realize what would you want us to do for your child?  And I think once you bring it home to the parent, that his child could be the next victim,  then they do step back and really think a little more rationally.  It's a bit logical with the process and the follow-up through, they usually come home.  Is there great answers?  Go ahead.  Can you hear me?  One thing is, you know, it's sort of under the current and all conversations with educators  is as your teachers, trying to implement kind of the big picture up above from administration  and from for the public school teachers, the DOE, and I've been a teacher, so I understand  that, but sort of on the other side of the coin, I'm now with the DOE, and I just wanted  to let you all know that it's incredibly encouraging for me to be here tonight.  And for what it's worth, there is somebody at the DOE, praying for you all every day.  It's probably hard to leave, but...  And I will certainly say I would appreciate and we'd all, well, I would appreciate your  prayers as well.  And then my quick question for you all is, when I was a teacher and I both worked as  a teacher in the public schools and then worked with the parochial schools in the Bronx  and Manhattan, there were a few moments where I just could really send you a message  that God was sort of showing me that the way I was interacting with the parent or my attitude  in a certain circumstance was totally infused by the grace that he had given me as a Christian  and I'm sorry, I'm a little upset.  And so my question for you all is maybe if you have a little anecdotal story from your  own experiences and educators, if when you just said, like, gosh, I couldn't have handled  that unless I had this world view.  I'll begin.  We talked about that we prayed, many of us prayed and we said we couldn't start out  day without prayer either reading the Bible or even at school or with others because what  I got to school each day, it's with a sense of adventure because we never know, you know,  you have the best laid plans and everyone is supposed to be in place and then a child  falls and gets cut.  We had an anecdote, a kindergarten kid fell in the yard and they thought that she had just  bumped her chin and when she went to the doctor, she had fractured her jaw and her jaw had  to be wired and it was with fear and trembling.  How do you speak to that parent when she comes?  What do you say to a parent in that case?  How would a parent react?  So there was always this prayer and the parent comes in and the administrators there we talked  to the parent and then sometimes they come in very hostile, sometimes they have issues  and they just need someone to talk to and as we speak to them and asking the Holy Spirit  to put the right words and at least in our mouth as we speak, the parents sometimes they  become very calm or that parent may just cry or we need just a hug that we have instances  of children whose parents are dying and they know they are dying and they have issues  of what's going to happen to my child and just a hug and then when that parent leaves  and they feel better or the situation is calm and we say thank God, you know, God is  so good that we say it all the time because we had no thought or no plan of how we would  face that situation so it happens I think almost daily at my school.  Just going back to the parent issue that June brought up a few minutes ago, it just happened  actually before I got here and I said I spent a lot of time investigating the game related  incident and I actually school safety had to walk out to parents today because they were  so enraged over the conversation and I guess to be honest like one of your first tendencies  would be while I wasn't able to complete the investigation because you had to be escorted  out because of your behavior so maybe I'll just go ahead and record it as this did happen  without getting to the bottom of it but I persisted for another rest of the day and I called  the parent back on the phone which was really not what I thought I should probably do before  coming here and trying to be positive after the way the last meeting went but I told her  the status of the investigation and that her son actually had not been one of the parties  that had participated in the in the occurrence and she said, Ms. Marlon, I felt so bad all  day I just wanted to apologize to you and so I just knew that in that like the fact  of just being able to call her back it was not it was just the grace of God just giving  me that after it had been you know two or three people walking out and I know that was  just totally grace. You're trying to re-weave something that you can tell needs to be related  these things need to be related to each other and they're not and it's very very very frustrated  but you're Christians and you know what that means that means that you eventually the things you  want to see happen are going to happen there will eventually be peace there will eventually be  justice there will eventually be whole families there will eventually you won't have parents dying  you're going to have a re-woven creation God is going to do it I mean there's a lot of jobs  that are more satisfying than your job because you're making something and you make it  well and then you send it out there and people buy it you make your money you go home your  product are change lives and maturity and wisdom and therefore you're always unhappy with your  product I mean it's just never what you want it to be it's very very frustrating but your  Christians it's you're not fighting a losing battle at all everything sad is going to come on  true someday so you're on the right side and you've got to live in that kind of hope now let's pray  Father we thank you that you have called us in this room to be educators and that you've called  us into a job that it seems so messy it's not like producing a piece of machinery and it's selling  it it's not like so many other jobs in which the product is a quantifiable and the bottom line  is so much easier to to grasp and to drive and to recognize we're talking about change lies we're  talking about learning wisdom we're talking about maturity we're talking about people becoming  real human beings and it seems like an endless maybe losing cause but it's not we know it's not  because of Christians and we thank you for all the ways in which the men and women in this room  are your agents for healing in the world and repairing and reweaving your creation thank you that  the resurrected Jesus proves to us that someday you will completely you will fulfill our deepest  desires to see our city hole in this family's hole so thank you for this time and continue to be our  great teacher Jesus Christ and his name we pray. Amen.
