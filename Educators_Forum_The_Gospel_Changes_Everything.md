### C.S. Lewis and Education

Yeah, I was actually a real-life formal teacher for five years at Graduate School Seminary actually lectured and I created tests and I graded tests and papers for five years. I said, get me back in the ministry where you can teach and teach you nobody knows whether the people are learning or not. It's wonderful. There's no way to find out. It seems like so, took all the pressure off.

Let me suggest, the only book that CS Lewis ever wrote on public education, that's what this book's supposedly about, the abolition of man, little booksy, short books, the sort of thing that everybody wants. Let me share two thoughts from the book. If you are a teacher and have never read it, or if you haven't read it in a long time, I suggest you read it because it is about education.

### The Essence of Modernity

The first essay is called Men Without Chests, very famous and in it, he takes a book that was written at the time, I guess, in the 1940s, a book that was supposedly a textbook for English literature for high school students, what we call high school. And in the book, there's this great quote here, that Lewis quotes.

> "The textbook says, when people say a waterfall is sublime, they think they are saying something very important about the waterfall, but they are only saying something about their feelings about the waterfall."

And Lewis pointed out that this is the very essence of modern, this is the essence of modernity. This is the essence of modern Western culture. **What they were saying is, if you talk about an objective fact, something that can be proven, something that's empirically investigatable, that's a fact. But if you say anything that can't be proven empirically, if you say adultery is a sin, or I believe in God, or a waterfall is sublime, you're just talking about feelings. It's subjective. It's not really important, David said.**

### Natural Law and Common Grace

And Lewis points out, this is the essence, and this is if you're a public school teacher, this is the essence of your problem. That you're allowed to talk about, supposedly, you're allowed to talk about anything that's subjective, empirically proven, something that can be rationally investigated. But when it comes to moral values, religious beliefs, I believe in God, I think adultery is wrong. Whenever you get into anything that can't be proven, that's subjective. That's supposed to be kept private. You're not allowed to talk about that.

### Christian Education vs. Public Education

It's of course a big hot issue, but in politics, am I allowed to bring my moral views into the public realm? Some people say, no, of course not. You don't bring your religious or moral views into the public, into politics. There we only talk about what's reasonable and rational, not what you think is your moral values.

### The Role of Faith in Education

Lewis responds by saying, if you really believe that everything is relative, and it comes to morality, he has this very famous place where he says, he says, if you're actually educating students in this way, if you're actually educating students to believe, that things that are objective, fact, are one thing. But all moral views, all views about morality, religion, or anything like that is completely subjective, completely to be kept private. Completely relative, that is, to your individual consciousness or to the culture you're in.

### Balancing Work and Rest

He says, you realize what's going to happen, and this is the quote that ends that essay.

> "You can hardly open a periodical without coming across a statement that our civilization needs drive or more self-sacrifice. In a sort of ghastly simplicity, we remove the organ and demand the function. We make men without chests and expect to them virtue and enterprise. We laugh at honor and our shock to find traders in our midst. We castrate and bid the gildings be fruitful."

### Engaging with Parents and Community

And what he's really saying is, if you really say everything is relative, except that which is empirically proven, self-sacrifice, why be self-sacrificial? Why care about the common good? Why be a good citizen? Why? He says, you can't educate people like that.

### Conclusion: Hope in Christian Education

So what's the answer? He actually brings out something called the Dow. And what he means by the Dow, T-A-O, taken by way from the Chinese idea that there is a kind of, it's natural law. He says he believes that, and most all religions believe, that the religions actually differ on many things like how you're saved. All human beings have some basic understanding of God and some basic understanding of right and wrong that we kind of know intuitively. And Lewis makes a case that on the basis of that, what Catholics would call natural law and what Protestants would call common grace. On the basis of the fact that people know some things intuitively, you can educate and you can appeal on the basis of this understanding that there's such a thing as common grace.

### C.S.路易斯与教育

是的，我实际上是一名真实的正式教师，在研究生院神学院讲课五年，我创建了测试并为五年的测试和论文评分。我说，把我带回事工中，在那里你可以教导，没有人知道人们是否在学习。这太棒了。没有办法知道。似乎如此，减轻了所有压力。

让我建议，C.S.路易斯唯一写过的关于公共教育的书，这本书据说是关于《人的废除》，小书，短书，是每个人都想要的那种东西。让我分享书中的两个想法。如果你是一名教师，从未读过，或者很久没有读过，我建议你读一读，因为它是关于教育的。

### 现代性的本质

第一篇文章叫做《没有胸膛的人》，非常有名，其中，他拿了一本当时写的书，我想是在1940年代，一本据说是高中生英语文学教科书的书。在书中，有这样一个伟大的引述，路易斯引用道。

> "教科书说，当人们说瀑布是崇高的，他们认为他们在说一些关于瀑布的重要事情，但他们只是在说一些关于他们对瀑布的感觉。"

路易斯指出，这正是现代的本质，这就是现代性的本质。这是现代西方文化的本质。**他们所说的是，如果你谈论一个客观事实，某些可以被证明的东西，某些可以被经验调查的东西，那就是一个事实。但如果你说任何不能被经验证明的东西，如果你说通奸是罪，或者我相信上帝，或者瀑布是崇高的，你只是在谈论感觉。这是主观的。这并不重要，大卫说。**

### 自然法与普遍恩典

路易斯指出，这就是本质，如果你是一名公立学校教师，这就是你的问题的本质。你被允许谈论，所谓的，你被允许谈论任何主观的，经验上被证明的东西，某些可以被理性调查的东西。但当涉及到道德价值观，宗教信仰，我相信上帝，我认为通奸是错误的。每当你进入任何不能被证明的东西，那就是主观的。那应该被保留为私人。你不被允许谈论那。

### 基督教教育与公共教育

当然这是一个大热门话题，但在政治中，我是否被允许将我的道德观点带入公共领域？有些人说，不，当然不是。你不把你的宗教或道德观点带入公共，带入政治。在那里我们只谈论什么是合理和理性的，而不是你认为的道德价值观。

### 信仰在教育中的角色

路易斯回应说，如果你真的相信一切都是相对的，并且涉及到道德，他有一个非常著名的地方，他说，他说，如果你实际上是在以这种方式教育学生，如果你实际上是在教育学生相信，客观的事实是一个东西。但所有的道德观点，所有关于道德，宗教或任何类似的观点都是完全主观的，完全应该保留为私人。完全相对的，也就是说，与你的个人意识或你所处的文化有关。

### 工作与休息的平衡

他说，你意识到会发生什么，这是那篇文章结尾的引述。

> "你几乎无法打开一本期刊而不看到一篇声明说我们的文明需要驱动力或更多的自我牺牲。在一种可怕的简单中，我们移除了器官并要求功能。我们制造没有胸膛的人并期望他们有美德和企业精神。我们嘲笑荣誉并对我们中间的叛徒感到震惊。我们阉割并要求阉割者多产。"

### 与家长和社区的互动

他真正想说的是，如果你真的说一切都是相对的，除了那些经验上被证明的东西，自我牺牲，为什么要自我牺牲？为什么要关心公共利益？为什么要做一个好公民？为什么？他说，你不能这样教育人。

### 结论：基督教教育中的希望

那么答案是什么？他实际上提出了一种叫做道的东西。他所指的道，T-A-O，取自中国的概念，即有一种自然法。他说他相信，并且几乎所有宗教都相信，宗教实际上在许多事情上有所不同，比如你如何得救。所有人类对上帝和对错都有一些基本的理解，我们有点直觉地知道。路易斯提出一个论点，基于这一点，天主教徒称之为自然法，基督教徒称之为普遍恩典。基于人们直觉地知道一些事情的事实，你可以教育并可以基于这种理解进行呼吁，认为有一种普遍恩典。
