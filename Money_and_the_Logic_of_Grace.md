## English Transcript / 英文原文

Our Scripture reading tonight is from the Book of Luke chapter 14 verses 7-24. When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, he told them this parable. When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for a person  more distinguished than you may have been invited. If so, the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, give this man your seat. Then humiliated, you will have to take the least important place.

But when you are invited, take the lowest place so that when your host comes, he will say to  you, friend, move up to a better place. Then you will be honored in the presence of all your fellow guests. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted. When Jesus said to his host, when you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends,  your brothers or relatives, or your rich neighbors. If you do, they may invite you back, and so you will be repaid.

But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the cripple, the lame, the blind, and you  will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous. When one of those at the table with him heard this, he said to Jesus, blessed is the man  who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God. Jesus replied, a certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests. At the time of the banquet, he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited, come,  for everything is now ready.

But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said, I have just bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please excuse me. Another said, I have just bought five yoke of oxen, and I am on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.

Still the other said, I just got married, so I can't come. The servant came back and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry, and ordered his servant, go out quickly into  the streets and alleys of the town, and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind and the  lame. Sir, the servant said, what you ordered has been done, but there is still room. Then the master told his servant, go out to the roads and country lanes, and make them  come in so that my house will be full.

I tell you, not one of those men who were invited will get to taste of my banquet. This is the word of the Lord. We are doing a short series in a month of June on the subject of how Christians ought  to be looking at their money and their possessions. We are looking at what Luke says about it. Three of the passages we are looking at this month come from the Gospel of Luke one next  week from Acts, the book of Acts which Luke also wrote, because Luke has so much to say about  the subject, and we are choosing June to do this because when you talk about money to  a congregation, I am going to minister talk about money to a congregation, and there is  a campaign going on where there is the end of the year operating budget where there are  some special offerings.

When you talk about, oh see, you need to give to this, it is actually natural for the  listeners to concentrate on the this, on the cause, on the thing. Instead of sitting back and saying, well, what is God, how does God want me to think  about money in general? What should my attitude be toward it? How should I relate my giving to my spending? How much should I spend on my self, how much should I give away?

That is what we want to look at here in the month of June because there is so much in  the Bible about it. So first of all, I actually only have two points to this sermon, not three, no, two. So maybe don't count on getting out early, but it is still two. The first point is that Jesus Christ in the middle of this chapter lays out an astonishing  standard for sacrificial giving, absolutely astonishing, so astonishing, that it will seem  unreasonable to us. Then that is point one, secondly, I am going to show how Jesus actually shows how reasonable  that kind of giving is because of the logic of the gospel.

So point one, an astonishing standard that Jesus lays out there for sacrificial giving  from us, his people, disciples, and then secondly, how he rationalizes that, how he grounds  it in the logic of the gospel. So first of all, let's look at this amazing standard in the middle of the passage. He says, it says, then Jesus said to his host, now who's the host? Jesus has been invited into the home of a very prominent man. It doesn't tell us that in the part that we read, but it's in the very beginning of the  chapter.

Jesus was invited to a big supper with lots of guests at a prominent home. And you see verse 7, it says, when he noticed the guests were picking places of honor at  the table. So this was a typical supper in which people were trying to sit as close to the host as  possible. And then Jesus says, when you give a luncheon or dinner, he says this to the host, do not  invite your friends, your brothers, your relatives, or your rich neighbors. That's who's there.

Now, to understand what's going on, we have to give you some little background here. The Greco-Roman world operated on the patronage system. This isn't totally alien because there's plenty of parts of the world that still do. The patronage system went like this. In every community, there were certain prominent wealthy individuals.

And if you want to do improve your station in life, move up at all. You had to make one of those people your patron. If that person was your patron, that person gave you loans, gave you gifts, opened doors  for you. But then you were part of their network. Patrons had networks of favorites.

And a favorite was somebody who got favors from the patron. And the patronage network of favorites meant that patronage could get a lot of things  done in a community because you had all these people that owed you. So you always got breaks on things, you always got things got done. Patrons could get a lot of things done in the community because your favorites would  grease the slides, political favors, that kind of thing. When you had these suppers, that was what was going on.

At the suppers, the people were trying to meet each other. You either were trying to sustain your place in life by the patrons and the favorites  were getting together to sustain their relationship, or you're trying to get new ones. You're trying to meet new patrons. You were trying to move up the ladder. And therefore, the people who came to a supper were extremely important.

You had to have rich neighbors. You had to have people at least at your level of society or better. And because of that, these were not just parties. They were extremely important. And they were extremely expensive.

But that was all right because you, through those parties, you had these supper parties. But you got the people there who you were already having deals, making deals with and people  who you were trying to incorporate into your network. And therefore, the party paid off. The party always paid for itself. It was very expensive, but a party paid for itself.

It was fun. It was extensive. It was expensive. But it was fun. But it also paid for you.

That was the system. Jesus Christ comes to this man who's a patron type. And has the audacity to say, when you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends,  or your brothers or relatives, or your rich neighbors, the people who are there. If you do, they will invite you back, and they will repay you. Of course, that's how the patronage system worked.

He says, but here's what I want. Here's what I want my disciples to do. When you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind, and  you will be blessed. Now, first of all, what is Jesus saying, and then secondly, what are the implications? First of all, what is he saying?

At first sight, when you and I read it, it looks like he's saying, never have your friends  over. Okay? So, let's finish our sermon right there and let us pray. Jesus says, never have your friends over. He says, it says so.

When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or sisters. Instead, you have to invite the poor. What's this? Now, you have to understand Semitic idioms. An idiom, as you all know, every language is an idiom, and an idiomatic expression makes  sense to people inside the language, but when you translate it into another language, if  that idiom doesn't operate in those other languages, then what actually happens is it makes  no sense because you take it literally.

And therefore, if you take that literally, it doesn't make much sense, but if you would  like another example of the same idiom later on in the chapter, in fact, 14 verse 26,  Jesus says, you must hate your father and mother if you want to be my disciple. Same thing. Hate your father and mother and follow me, you say, oh, really? What does that mean? Could it mean that Jesus was saying, you remember those ten commandments that went about  in front?

Forget that. You think that's what he's saying? Can't it mean I was forgetting? No, of course not. Well, what's he saying?

It's an idiom, and what he's actually saying is, even though he says, follow me and hate  your father and mother. What he really means is not that you shouldn't love your father and mother, nor is he saying  you love your father and mother too much, or you can love your father too much. All he's saying is, you have to love me way more, far more, massively more, so much so  that your love for me makes your love for your father and mother look like hate. So when the idiom says, don't love your father and mother love me, what it really means  is love me far more, not that you shouldn't love your father and mother. And when it says, don't give parties for your friends, don't do the things necessary  to maintain your place in life, don't do recreation, don't do entertainment, don't ever  go out to eat.

Not buy nice clothes so that you're able to maintain your place in society. Those are all equivalents for today, what these sufferers were, equivalents for today. He's not saying don't do that. He's saying, you're giving to charity and ministry. You're giving to ministry by which you give people spiritual life, so people find faith.

You're giving to charity so people get physical life because they're fed when they're hungry. You're giving to ministry and charity should be massively more than the money you spend  on, entertainment, recreation, your nice clothes, your vacations, all that is really what  these sufferers represented. They didn't have vacations, that this was their vestivities. That's what he's saying, not that you should never have, you should never spend any money  on yourself, but the money you give to ministry and charity ought to be just massively bitter. More.

What does that mean? That's what he's saying. What are the implications of that? The implications are that you're giving to ministry and charity must have a priority and  it must be sacrificial. Now think about this now.

By the way, I've never understood the implications of this passage until the last couple of weeks  getting ready to preach it to you. First of all, he's talking about priority. When he says, love, hate your father and mother and love me, he's not saying you shouldn't  love your father and mother. He's saying as you need to love me more, I'm the priority. If you have to choose between me and your parents, you must choose me, isn't that what he's  saying?

Doesn't Jesus say that? Yes, of course he is. Now what is he saying here? Same thing. He's actually saying, you're giving needs to be a necessity.

You're giving to ministry and charities to be a necessity. It's actually optional and negotiable is the money you spend on yourself. Switch it. Right now, for most of us, we have certain financial goals. We have certain things, lifestyle goals.

There are certain ways in which we want to live. There's vacations we want to take, there's clothes we want to buy, there's things we want  to do. And if we have enough money to do that and to give to ministry and charity, then we do. But that's the optional whereas spending money on you, that's the priority. That's the necessity.

But it's, Jesus says, switch them. Some years ago, there was a British farmer who raised livestock. And he had a cow who was pregnant. He was very happy about that. Because he actually had enough livestock on the farm for his needs, to produce the things  he needed.

And therefore, he was going to be able to sell that calf, once the calf was born and it  would grow up. He was going to sell the calf and make a tidy profit. But to his joy, the cow had two calves, twins. Which meant he was going to get twice as much money from the sale when he sold them and  he was very excited. And he came into his wife and he had a sort of magnanimous moment.

And he says, you know, he says, honey, you know, we're Christians and we go to the church. And you know what, when these two calves grow up and I sell them, I'm going to give half  the proceeds to the Lord. Half the proceeds are going to go to the church. And to sell the two calves, I'm going to get, you know, X amount of money and the amount  of money I get from one, we'll go to the Lord and the rest, we'll keep ourselves. And she says, that's wonderful.

How spiritual. Several weeks later he walks in to the house, very, very sad in his face. She says, what's wrong? He says, oh, the Lord's calf died. You know, they got sick, but the one got better and the other one didn't get better and  it died.

And she says, that's interesting. She says, I didn't remember that we designated one of those calves to be the Lord. Oh, no. He says, almost from the beginning, I said, that's the Lord's calf right there. And that's the one that died.

What a shame. Now at the point of the story is, it's always the Lord's calf that dies. In other words, there's certain clothes we want to buy, there's certain vacations we  want to have, there's certain trips we want to take, there's certain ways, there's  certain places we want to live. And that's the priority. And if we have enough money to give for charity and ministry, we will.

And if there's a problem and we're pinched, that's where we take it out of. We take it out of the charity and ministry and Jesus says, I want you to switch those. I want you to take it out of your own hide. Which means the implication of this is not just that your giving has to have a priority  but also it needs to be sacrificial. This passage goes along with all the rest of the passages in the Bible on giving.

In the Old Testament, the standard forgiving of believers was very clear, 10% tithe. There was tithe. Oh, it just says, 10% of your income you give to the Levites, to the Tabernacle, to the  poor, to ministry and to charity. However, when you get to the New Testament, there is one place where Jesus actually says  you should tithe. It's actually in Luke 11 verses 42 and 43 where he's talking to the Pharisees about how  they tithe.

And he says, you should do that. That's right. So Jesus is not against the tithe. And yet almost nowhere else in the New Testament does the tithe even get mentioned. Instead, we've got statements like this, 2 Corinthians 8, where Paul is telling, he's  trying to get the Corinthian Christians to give money to the poor in Jerusalem.

And he reminds them that the Macedonian Christians are already given. And he says in verse 3, they gave as much as they were able and beyond their abilities. What does that mean? See, when we say, oh, I'd like to give more but I can't afford to give what you really  mean is I can't afford to give without sacrificing. But that's the whole point.

I believe in the Old Testament, you have tithe, 10%, that's the standard of giving. And Jesus is saying, that's fine, that's a fine place to start. But he says, basically, what the New Testament is saying, this is the real way you know  you're giving enough. It's got to hurt. It means there's got to be sacrifices made.

It means there are things you can't do because you're giving. There's places you can't go because you're giving. You're giving so much. He's got to be sacrifice. That's the standard.

And that's what Jesus is saying. And it's an amazing to go to a patron and to say, I don't want you to throw a supper  and invite your rich neighbors and your friends. I want you to invite the poor. You realize when you threw a supper for your own social class where all the patroning  things were going on, when you threw that party, that was expensive, but it paid for  yourself. That's how deals were made.

That's, you know, it was a way of maintaining your business relationships, basically. So when you gave a meal, like the typical way, Jesus said, there's a way for you to spend  your money that you get your money back. They repay you. But if you were actually to throw a big feast and invite the poor and the crippled  in the lame in the blind, that would just be money out the door. In other words, Jesus is saying one kind of use of your money is not sacrificial and one  kind is, and that's what I want, sacrifice.

Now, does this seem unreasonable? It's pretty shocking. As I look at it, it makes me certainly think about myself, and I wrestle with it, too. I'm certainly not up here saying, well, I've got this together, and why don't you? But I think we all need to stand under the text and look at it.

This passage is seldom looked at as a stewardship passage, but over the years I've come to see  what this means. John Newton, the guy who wrote the old Anglican minister in the 18th century wrote amazing  grace in all those hymns, he found this passage very troubling. And he said, all I can see is, it says, no matter how I slice it, I know Jesus doesn't  mean it literally that you don't ever see your friends or anything like that. But no matter how I read it, it means I should be giving away a lot more money than I  am. All right, unreasonable?

Not if you understand the gospel. I'd like to show you three ways in which Jesus uses the gospel to help you see that this  kind of use of your money is eminently reasonable. It's a long passage, and I'd just like to show you there's three speeches. In the very beginning, he speaks to all the guests from verse 8 to 11, and then in the  middle he speaks to the hosts from verses 12 to 14, and then at the end he actually speaks  to one smug guest and tells the great story of the parable, the great banquet, and at  the end of every one of these speeches, he shows us some way in which the gospel helps  us understand why it's very reasonable to give sacrifice. Today is Giving Tuesday, and we want you to know about a special opportunity we have  this year.

As you may know, gospel and life supports Redeemer City to City, a ministry dedicated to growing  gospel movements in cities around the world through church planting. City to City was co-founded by Tim Keller, and he cared deeply about this mission. And this coming year at a 2026 training event in Kenya, City to City will help train,  coach, and support two cohorts of 20 pastors planting churches all over Africa. This Giving Tuesday, we have a goal to raise $150,000 to help sponsor the church planters  attending this training intensive in Nairobi, Kenya, so that City to City can help and support  these church planters to start churches across Africa. This work is vital to the spread of the gospel in African cities from Kampala to Legos  to Johannesburg.

So as you think about how you may give on Giving Tuesday, please consider making a gift  to gospel in life. Every dollar we receive today will go directly to the work City to City is doing to help  start new churches in Africa in 2026. To make a gift today, visit gospelonlife.com slash Tuesday, again as gospelonlife.com slash  Tuesday. And thank you for your generous and faithful support of this ministry. Now, here's Dr.

Keller with the rest of today's message. Here's the first one. In verses 7 through 11, 7, we already saw this. He sees how the guests are picking places of honor at the table. And then he says this, when someone invites you to a feast, don't take the higher, the  more honored seats, let somebody there will ask you to move, and then you're humiliated.

Take the lower seats so somebody asks you, oh come on up here closer to me. Now at one level, this is just practical. What he's really saying is don't be the kind of person that suits your own horn. If you suit your own horn, people are not going to like you. And so the irony is if you're a self-promoter, you're always pushing yourself, look how good  I am.

I know how to do this. I know how to do this. Basically, the people who most promote themselves very often don't get promoted because  everybody else presents them. So what he's saying is be modest and by the quality of your life, if people will see  your quality and they'll speak well of you and that's better than if you speak well  of yourself. There's a lot of proverbs in chapter 26 and 27 that say the same thing, but Jesus is  not just saying this.

He's not just being pragmatic because when you get to verse 11, he is taking this principle  and he's showing that this is the core of spiritual reality. He says in verse 11, everyone, not just sometimes it's smart to not suit your own horn. Verse 11, he's getting cosmic here and he says everyone who exalts himself will be humbled  and he who humbles himself will be exalted. Now I would not mind at all to preach an entire sermon just on that text because what he's  trying to say is true in every single area of life, but ultimately at the core of spirituality  it's true and here's what that means. If you go to God and say, I deserve acceptance, you will be rejected because that shows you  do not know what's in your own heart.

But if you go to God and say I deserve rejection, please forgive me, you will get acceptance. And that's the gospel. Religion says you go to God and say I deserve acceptance, look at all the good deeds. But the gospel says if you say you deserve acceptance, you will get rejection, if you say you deserve  rejection, which means if with God you take the lower seat, he will accept you. He will exalt you because the gospel is he who humbles himself will be exalted and he  who exalts himself will be humbled.

If you exalt yourself, you'll be humbled because that's salvation by works. If you humble yourself, you'll be exalted because that's salvation by grace. But look at this term exalted, what does it mean that God will exalt you? James 4, 10, 1 Peter 5, 6 says if you humble yourself under the mighty hand of God, he will  exalt you. He will lift you up.

Jesus says to the Pharisees in John 12 verse 43, he says, you love the praise of men more  than the praise of God. And there it is. If you have the praise of God in your heart, if you've repented, if you've  taken the lower seat as it were with God, and he has exalted you and he has received you  and he's accepted you by grace, your heart is filled with the praise of God, a sense  of the light in you, a sense of his love, you know what that means? You have a new spiritual inner wealth, you have a new wealth inside, you have a real  riches, you have real value, you have real security, and you no longer look at your external  wealth the same, do you? Because money, if you don't have God in the center of your life, money is more than money.

It's security, it's self-esteem, I've got money, so I know, I'm important, I've got money,  so I know I'm secure. If you don't have God in the center of your life, if you don't have the praise of God  in the center of your life, you're like these people scrambling to get to the top, always  trying to connect to people who are a little better off than you, trying to get more money,  trying to get more security, trying to get more prosperity, trying to get more status,  but Jesus says, my disciples have the praise of God in the center of their being, they've  been exalted, and as a result they're not scrambling. You know what, there's something very balanced about verses 8, 9, and 10, what he's actually  saying there is, I don't want my people, I don't want my disciples to be passionate about  getting up the ladder and getting admitted into those inner circles. That should not drive your life, but if somebody invites you in, fine, he's, I'm not against  Christians being successful, it shouldn't be the passion of your life, if it happens,  that's great, but you should have such an incredible inner spiritual wealth that it makes  it easy for you to give away your external wealth because now your external wealth money  is just money to you, it's nothing more. So that's the first way in which the logic of the gospel makes giving away your money  in radical portions more sensible, but that's not all, secondly, the second speech we already  looked at, but we didn't look at the end of it.

It's in verse 12 to 14, and he's telling the host, don't invite these people, invite the  poor, the cripple, the lame in the blind, and you'll be blessed, and then he says, although  they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous. Again, I would love to spend a whole sermon on this, but I'll just tell you this. You know what he's saying? He says, here's the problem with living life the way Jesus says, you ought to live. You should be pouring yourself out for people.

You should be letting people into your life. You should be caring for people who are troubled. You should be going the extra mile to be friends to people who other people don't want  to be friends to. You should be giving a tremendous amount of your money away. You should be very involved in ministry and charity.

You know what that's going to mean? It means you're going to feel like, sometimes you're going to feel like I'm missing out. Other people have the money to do this. They go here. They do this.

I'm missing out. I'm not going to have this experience. I'm not going to go on that trip. I'm never going to be able to live like that. I'm missing out.

Jesus says, no, because of the resurrection, don't think you're missing out at all because  your future is not an ethereal future in which we're disembodied consciousnesses, kind  of floating around through all eternity, you're going to get bodies. The kingdom of God is a feast. The future kingdom of God is a feast. You're going to get bodies. Jesus Christ, the risen Jesus Christ was there.

They could feel Him. He ate a fish. And what that means is in the future, you're not going to miss out on anything. David Martin Lloyd-Jones, the great British preacher in the 20th century, mid-20th century,  once preached a sermon on 1 Corinthians 15 about the resurrection. And it moved me very much.

It's really sank deep into my heart. I have an old tape of it somewhere, and I have notes that I took on it. And here's what he says near the end. He says, and this is paraphrase, but these are my notes of what he said. He says, this is 1 Corinthians 15 about the resurrection of the body.

He says, the kingdom of God is a feast. You are going to have new bodies. Romans 8.11 says, if the Spirit that raised Jesus Christ is in you, He will also give life  to your mortal body through the Spirit in you. He says, this is Lloyd-Jones speaking. He says, you know as you begin to get older, you begin to think that your enemy is your  body.

But no, the enemy is in your body, and it will be driven out someday. You're going to get new bodies, resurrected bodies, healed bodies. Jonathan Edwards, the great New England minister, once said, right now in this body, this  version of our fallen body, our body subject to sin and disease and death, you've got five  senses, right? Five senses? But what about, maybe in our new bodies, we'll have 100?

There may be a thousand or 10,000, which means right now you are compared to what you're  going to be like in the resurrection. You're just a vegetable compared to what you will be. Your future self. And then he went on and said, Jesus Christ, the risen Christ ate a fish. Your future glory is not an ethereal esoteric form of impersonal consciousness.

You will eat in the kingdom of God. You will love. You will hug. You will be hugged in the kingdom of God. You will sing.

You'll dance. Your feet will touch the ground. Your feet. You'll eat and you'll sing and you'll love and you'll, in realms of power and glory  and satisfaction that you cannot now imagine, we will walk in the kingdom of God. We will not float over the kingdom of God.

We will march in the kingdom of God. We will eat and drink with the Son of Man. Are you afraid that you're going to miss out on some aspect of life because you are  giving so much away, you're giving so much of your time away, you're giving so much  of your money away? You will not miss out on anything. Why?

Because of the resurrection. They will not repay you in this life is what he's saying. But the resurrection, and that makes it very sensible to give away. You won't miss out on anything. Lastly, so see what he's saying.

He's saying, here's why you can give away your money. First of all, you've got a new internal wealth according to the gospel. Secondly, you've got a guaranteed future wealth according to the gospel. The resurrection, but one more thing, you need to see the sacrifice of Jesus Christ that  was required for you to get into the feast. Look at this great banquet story.

This is the last story. And actually, you could easily, again, preach a whole sermon just on the parable and many  people do. And Jesus is speaking to a smug guest at the banquet who hears him talking to the host  and says in verse 15, he says, blessed is the man who will eat at the feast in the kingdom  of God. Now, this is one of those social climbing, scrambling guests. And he clearly is sure he's going to be there.

And Jesus decides, okay, if you think the kingdom of God is a feast, right? Let me tell you what the kingdom of God is really like. He tells this parable to show this man how the kingdom of God's salvation really works. And the parable is, first, a great patron type person is throwing a huge feast. The word great there is the Greek word mega.

It's a mega feast. It's an incredible feast. Hundreds of guests, maybe thousands of guests, I don't know. And he sends out his first invitation and his first invitation is come all is now ready. The first set of invitees, and their invitees that ordinarily come to one of these, their  people of the social class of the, you know, the inviteer, they're too busy.

They've got good reasons. They're doing business deals. They got married. There's a good reasons, but they don't come. And that master of the feast says, in that case, let's take the people who would never  be qualified for a feast like this.

Let's go to the people who actually shouldn't be here. And first, he sends them out, notice, to the urban poor. Because first, he sends his servant out to the streets and the alleys, it says. And he brings in the poor and the crippled and the blind and the lame and they come in. But there's still seats open.

So then he sends them out to, it says at the very end, verse 25, go out to the roads and  the country lanes and make them come in so that my house will be full. Roads and country lanes, in the Old King James Bible, it says the highways and the hedges. Because at this point, he's sending the servant out to the rural poor, to the people along  country lanes who lived in the hedges along the lame. And those people were very desperate. Many of them were robbers.

They were dangerous. They were desperate. And they were more destitute than the urban poor. And notice, for the rural poor, he actually says go out to them and go out to the roads  and country lanes and make them come in. And the commentators are always amazed at this text.

It's a Greek word that really means drive them in, argue them in, debate with them, persuade  them to come in because they're not going to be persuaded, why not? Because the kingdom of God that Jesus Christ is depicting for us is a full finished salvation. See what the invitation is, come, all is now ready. That's salvation. Come, all is now ready.

Do you know what that means? The kingdom of God? If it's a feast, it's not a potluck dinner. Potluck means you bring something. Jesus says absolutely not.

The kingdom of God is finished. There is nothing to prepare. There is nothing to purchase. There's nothing to cook. It's all finished.

You just have to receive a free and full salvation. No wonder the people out in the highways and hedges can't believe it. The master says the servants, you're going to have to go out there and argue with them. They're never going to believe they're being invited to something like this. And I want you to see, because I think Jesus wants you to see, that that's you and me  out there in the hedges.

We don't really believe the gospel of grace. We have to drive it in. Frankly, many, many of us are still in the hedges. We still say, oh Lord, I know that somehow, if I live a good enough life, you'll bless  me. That means you're still in the hedges.

You have an understood the logic of the gospel, and we can't possibly come in. We don't deserve it. That's right. We don't deserve it, because verse 24 says, I tell you, one of those men who were invited  and turned down the invitation will get a taste of my banquet. But verse 24 points me to Jesus, points us to Jesus, you know why?

There's people on the outside, they're the proud, they're the ones who were too proud  to come, and there's people on the inside, they were the humble. But why are we able to come in just with humility? Why are we able to get a full, free banquet just because we're willing to say, oh Lord, I'm  not qualified? It's not humility that earns that banquet. It's what Jesus Christ did on the cross.

At the end of, in Matthew 25, there's two parables. And each parable talks about judgment day. And in one parable, the Lord on judgment day says to some people, well done, good and faithful  servant, enter into my feast, the joy of my yearmaster. And to another set of people, in another parable, the Lord on judgment day says, depart from  me, cursed into everlasting fire. Well done, good and faithful servant, come into the feast.

But apart from me, he cursed, you have no taste of my feast. Get out. Jesus was the one person who loved God with all his heart, soul, strength, and mind, loved  his neighbor as himself, lived a perfect life. And at the end of his life, he should have heard God say to him, well done, good and faithful  servant, enter into the joy of your master. But instead, we know what he heard on the cross.

Why did Jesus say, my God, my God, why has thou forsaken me? Because he was hearing in his soul, God say, depart from me, he cursed into everlasting  fire. He was thrown out. He was cast out, which is what we deserve, so we can be brought in. He heard, depart from me, he cursed into everlasting fire, so that we could hear when all we have  to do is repent.

All we have to do is just say, oh, I'm not, you know, I'm unqualified. And God will say, well done, good and faithful servant, enter into the joy of your master. Why? Because it's not our humility that earns the banquet, it's what Jesus Christ did. He was cast out so that we could be brought in.

He sacrificed everything, and that's the final logic of the gospel, piece of the gospel  that helps us with our giving. When you realize that Jesus Christ sacrificed to give us life, you will start to say, how  can I sacrifice to give other people life? I live by the sacrifice of Christ. It's because of his sacrifice that I live. Now sacrifice your money to ministry so people spiritually live, to charity so people physically  live who are hungry.

By Jesus' sacrifice, you live now by your sacrifice, not of your blood, but of your money  other people can live. And the more you see that you live by Christ sacrifice, the more reasonable it will be for  you to give sacrificially. So it's the inner wealth that we have, it's the guarantee of future wealth that we have  because of what Jesus Christ did, though he was rich, he became poor, though he was an insider,  he became an outsider, though he had the highest seat, he was thrown out of the feast, so that  you could be brought in. And therefore, sacrificial giving is just reasonable. Let's wrestle with this together as a community.

Some of you are guests, probably, you don't even, I'm not obviously after your money because  you don't even live here. Some of you, in fact, and here's the other thing I want you to know, we'll talk about  this next week. I'm not here to say, you now because of this sermon, here's your application, give money  to Redeemer. First, a lot of you don't go to Redeemer, you're not members of Redeemer. I don't want you to think about that for a second.

I want you to think, I'm asking, here's another minister asking me for money. I want you to say, what should my attitude toward my money be in light of the gospel? And that's a frightening, frightening question to ask because as John Newton said, I really  don't know how to quite get my hands, my head around what Jesus is saying here, but I  just know this, I need to be giving a lot more than I am now, and I think that's right. Let's pray. Our Father, help us to be conformed to the image of your Son, though he was rich, he became  poor, though he was an insider, he was cast out.

And when we see that, that has got to affect the way in which we think about our funds and  about our money and about our lifestyle and about how we spend it, I pray, Lord, that  you would enable us to, as a community, be famous for a generosity to each other and  to the city. And I pray that you would more and more conform this into the image of your Son who came  not to be served, but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many. It's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

Our Scripture reading tonight is from the Book of Luke chapter 14 verses 7-24. When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, he told them this parable. When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for a person  more distinguished than you may have been invited. If so, the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, give this man your seat. Then humiliated, you will have to take the least important place.

But when you are invited, take the lowest place so that when your host comes, he will say to  you, friend, move up to a better place. Then you will be honored in the presence of all your fellow guests. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted. When Jesus said to his host, when you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends,  your brothers or relatives, or your rich neighbors. If you do, they may invite you back, and so you will be repaid.

But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the cripple, the lame, the blind, and you  will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous. When one of those at the table with him heard this, he said to Jesus, blessed is the man  who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God. Jesus replied, a certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests. At the time of the banquet, he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited, come,  for everything is now ready.

But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said, I have just bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please excuse me. Another said, I have just bought five yoke of oxen, and I am on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.

Still the other said, I just got married, so I can't come. The servant came back and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry, and ordered his servant, go out quickly into  the streets and alleys of the town, and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind and the  lame. Sir, the servant said, what you ordered has been done, but there is still room. Then the master told his servant, go out to the roads and country lanes, and make them  come in so that my house will be full.

I tell you, not one of those men who were invited will get to taste of my banquet. This is the word of the Lord. We are doing a short series in a month of June on the subject of how Christians ought  to be looking at their money and their possessions. We are looking at what Luke says about it. Three of the passages we are looking at this month come from the Gospel of Luke one next  week from Acts, the book of Acts which Luke also wrote, because Luke has so much to say about  the subject, and we are choosing June to do this because when you talk about money to  a congregation, I am going to minister talk about money to a congregation, and there is  a campaign going on where there is the end of the year operating budget where there are  some special offerings.

When you talk about, oh see, you need to give to this, it is actually natural for the  listeners to concentrate on the this, on the cause, on the thing. Instead of sitting back and saying, well, what is God, how does God want me to think  about money in general? What should my attitude be toward it? How should I relate my giving to my spending? How much should I spend on my self, how much should I give away?

That is what we want to look at here in the month of June because there is so much in  the Bible about it. So first of all, I actually only have two points to this sermon, not three, no, two. So maybe don't count on getting out early, but it is still two. The first point is that Jesus Christ in the middle of this chapter lays out an astonishing  standard for sacrificial giving, absolutely astonishing, so astonishing, that it will seem  unreasonable to us. Then that is point one, secondly, I am going to show how Jesus actually shows how reasonable  that kind of giving is because of the logic of the gospel.

So point one, an astonishing standard that Jesus lays out there for sacrificial giving  from us, his people, disciples, and then secondly, how he rationalizes that, how he grounds  it in the logic of the gospel. So first of all, let's look at this amazing standard in the middle of the passage. He says, it says, then Jesus said to his host, now who's the host? Jesus has been invited into the home of a very prominent man. It doesn't tell us that in the part that we read, but it's in the very beginning of the  chapter.

Jesus was invited to a big supper with lots of guests at a prominent home. And you see verse 7, it says, when he noticed the guests were picking places of honor at  the table. So this was a typical supper in which people were trying to sit as close to the host as  possible. And then Jesus says, when you give a luncheon or dinner, he says this to the host, do not  invite your friends, your brothers, your relatives, or your rich neighbors. That's who's there.

Now, to understand what's going on, we have to give you some little background here. The Greco-Roman world operated on the patronage system. This isn't totally alien because there's plenty of parts of the world that still do. The patronage system went like this. In every community, there were certain prominent wealthy individuals.

And if you want to do improve your station in life, move up at all. You had to make one of those people your patron. If that person was your patron, that person gave you loans, gave you gifts, opened doors  for you. But then you were part of their network. Patrons had networks of favorites.

And a favorite was somebody who got favors from the patron. And the patronage network of favorites meant that patronage could get a lot of things  done in a community because you had all these people that owed you. So you always got breaks on things, you always got things got done. Patrons could get a lot of things done in the community because your favorites would  grease the slides, political favors, that kind of thing. When you had these suppers, that was what was going on.

At the suppers, the people were trying to meet each other. You either were trying to sustain your place in life by the patrons and the favorites  were getting together to sustain their relationship, or you're trying to get new ones. You're trying to meet new patrons. You were trying to move up the ladder. And therefore, the people who came to a supper were extremely important.

You had to have rich neighbors. You had to have people at least at your level of society or better. And because of that, these were not just parties. They were extremely important. And they were extremely expensive.

But that was all right because you, through those parties, you had these supper parties. But you got the people there who you were already having deals, making deals with and people  who you were trying to incorporate into your network. And therefore, the party paid off. The party always paid for itself. It was very expensive, but a party paid for itself.

It was fun. It was extensive. It was expensive. But it was fun. But it also paid for you.

That was the system. Jesus Christ comes to this man who's a patron type. And has the audacity to say, when you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends,  or your brothers or relatives, or your rich neighbors, the people who are there. If you do, they will invite you back, and they will repay you. Of course, that's how the patronage system worked.

He says, but here's what I want. Here's what I want my disciples to do. When you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind, and  you will be blessed. Now, first of all, what is Jesus saying, and then secondly, what are the implications? First of all, what is he saying?

At first sight, when you and I read it, it looks like he's saying, never have your friends  over. Okay? So, let's finish our sermon right there and let us pray. Jesus says, never have your friends over. He says, it says so.

When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or sisters. Instead, you have to invite the poor. What's this? Now, you have to understand Semitic idioms. An idiom, as you all know, every language is an idiom, and an idiomatic expression makes  sense to people inside the language, but when you translate it into another language, if  that idiom doesn't operate in those other languages, then what actually happens is it makes  no sense because you take it literally.

And therefore, if you take that literally, it doesn't make much sense, but if you would  like another example of the same idiom later on in the chapter, in fact, 14 verse 26,  Jesus says, you must hate your father and mother if you want to be my disciple. Same thing. Hate your father and mother and follow me, you say, oh, really? What does that mean? Could it mean that Jesus was saying, you remember those ten commandments that went about  in front?

Forget that. You think that's what he's saying? Can't it mean I was forgetting? No, of course not. Well, what's he saying?

It's an idiom, and what he's actually saying is, even though he says, follow me and hate  your father and mother. What he really means is not that you shouldn't love your father and mother, nor is he saying  you love your father and mother too much, or you can love your father too much. All he's saying is, you have to love me way more, far more, massively more, so much so  that your love for me makes your love for your father and mother look like hate. So when the idiom says, don't love your father and mother love me, what it really means  is love me far more, not that you shouldn't love your father and mother. And when it says, don't give parties for your friends, don't do the things necessary  to maintain your place in life, don't do recreation, don't do entertainment, don't ever  go out to eat.

Not buy nice clothes so that you're able to maintain your place in society. Those are all equivalents for today, what these sufferers were, equivalents for today. He's not saying don't do that. He's saying, you're giving to charity and ministry. You're giving to ministry by which you give people spiritual life, so people find faith.

You're giving to charity so people get physical life because they're fed when they're hungry. You're giving to ministry and charity should be massively more than the money you spend  on, entertainment, recreation, your nice clothes, your vacations, all that is really what  these sufferers represented. They didn't have vacations, that this was their vestivities. That's what he's saying, not that you should never have, you should never spend any money  on yourself, but the money you give to ministry and charity ought to be just massively bitter. More.

What does that mean? That's what he's saying. What are the implications of that? The implications are that you're giving to ministry and charity must have a priority and  it must be sacrificial. Now think about this now.

By the way, I've never understood the implications of this passage until the last couple of weeks  getting ready to preach it to you. First of all, he's talking about priority. When he says, love, hate your father and mother and love me, he's not saying you shouldn't  love your father and mother. He's saying as you need to love me more, I'm the priority. If you have to choose between me and your parents, you must choose me, isn't that what he's  saying?

Doesn't Jesus say that? Yes, of course he is. Now what is he saying here? Same thing. He's actually saying, you're giving needs to be a necessity.

You're giving to ministry and charities to be a necessity. It's actually optional and negotiable is the money you spend on yourself. Switch it. Right now, for most of us, we have certain financial goals. We have certain things, lifestyle goals.

There are certain ways in which we want to live. There's vacations we want to take, there's clothes we want to buy, there's things we want  to do. And if we have enough money to do that and to give to ministry and charity, then we do. But that's the optional whereas spending money on you, that's the priority. That's the necessity.

But it's, Jesus says, switch them. Some years ago, there was a British farmer who raised livestock. And he had a cow who was pregnant. He was very happy about that. Because he actually had enough livestock on the farm for his needs, to produce the things  he needed.

And therefore, he was going to be able to sell that calf, once the calf was born and it  would grow up. He was going to sell the calf and make a tidy profit. But to his joy, the cow had two calves, twins. Which meant he was going to get twice as much money from the sale when he sold them and  he was very excited. And he came into his wife and he had a sort of magnanimous moment.

And he says, you know, he says, honey, you know, we're Christians and we go to the church. And you know what, when these two calves grow up and I sell them, I'm going to give half  the proceeds to the Lord. Half the proceeds are going to go to the church. And to sell the two calves, I'm going to get, you know, X amount of money and the amount  of money I get from one, we'll go to the Lord and the rest, we'll keep ourselves. And she says, that's wonderful.

How spiritual. Several weeks later he walks in to the house, very, very sad in his face. She says, what's wrong? He says, oh, the Lord's calf died. You know, they got sick, but the one got better and the other one didn't get better and  it died.

And she says, that's interesting. She says, I didn't remember that we designated one of those calves to be the Lord. Oh, no. He says, almost from the beginning, I said, that's the Lord's calf right there. And that's the one that died.

What a shame. Now at the point of the story is, it's always the Lord's calf that dies. In other words, there's certain clothes we want to buy, there's certain vacations we  want to have, there's certain trips we want to take, there's certain ways, there's  certain places we want to live. And that's the priority. And if we have enough money to give for charity and ministry, we will.

And if there's a problem and we're pinched, that's where we take it out of. We take it out of the charity and ministry and Jesus says, I want you to switch those. I want you to take it out of your own hide. Which means the implication of this is not just that your giving has to have a priority  but also it needs to be sacrificial. This passage goes along with all the rest of the passages in the Bible on giving.

In the Old Testament, the standard forgiving of believers was very clear, 10% tithe. There was tithe. Oh, it just says, 10% of your income you give to the Levites, to the Tabernacle, to the  poor, to ministry and to charity. However, when you get to the New Testament, there is one place where Jesus actually says  you should tithe. It's actually in Luke 11 verses 42 and 43 where he's talking to the Pharisees about how  they tithe.

And he says, you should do that. That's right. So Jesus is not against the tithe. And yet almost nowhere else in the New Testament does the tithe even get mentioned. Instead, we've got statements like this, 2 Corinthians 8, where Paul is telling, he's  trying to get the Corinthian Christians to give money to the poor in Jerusalem.

And he reminds them that the Macedonian Christians are already given. And he says in verse 3, they gave as much as they were able and beyond their abilities. What does that mean? See, when we say, oh, I'd like to give more but I can't afford to give what you really  mean is I can't afford to give without sacrificing. But that's the whole point.

I believe in the Old Testament, you have tithe, 10%, that's the standard of giving. And Jesus is saying, that's fine, that's a fine place to start. But he says, basically, what the New Testament is saying, this is the real way you know  you're giving enough. It's got to hurt. It means there's got to be sacrifices made.

It means there are things you can't do because you're giving. There's places you can't go because you're giving. You're giving so much. He's got to be sacrifice. That's the standard.

And that's what Jesus is saying. And it's an amazing to go to a patron and to say, I don't want you to throw a supper  and invite your rich neighbors and your friends. I want you to invite the poor. You realize when you threw a supper for your own social class where all the patroning  things were going on, when you threw that party, that was expensive, but it paid for  yourself. That's how deals were made.

That's, you know, it was a way of maintaining your business relationships, basically. So when you gave a meal, like the typical way, Jesus said, there's a way for you to spend  your money that you get your money back. They repay you. But if you were actually to throw a big feast and invite the poor and the crippled  in the lame in the blind, that would just be money out the door. In other words, Jesus is saying one kind of use of your money is not sacrificial and one  kind is, and that's what I want, sacrifice.

Now, does this seem unreasonable? It's pretty shocking. As I look at it, it makes me certainly think about myself, and I wrestle with it, too. I'm certainly not up here saying, well, I've got this together, and why don't you? But I think we all need to stand under the text and look at it.

This passage is seldom looked at as a stewardship passage, but over the years I've come to see  what this means. John Newton, the guy who wrote the old Anglican minister in the 18th century wrote amazing  grace in all those hymns, he found this passage very troubling. And he said, all I can see is, it says, no matter how I slice it, I know Jesus doesn't  mean it literally that you don't ever see your friends or anything like that. But no matter how I read it, it means I should be giving away a lot more money than I  am. All right, unreasonable?

Not if you understand the gospel. I'd like to show you three ways in which Jesus uses the gospel to help you see that this  kind of use of your money is eminently reasonable. It's a long passage, and I'd just like to show you there's three speeches. In the very beginning, he speaks to all the guests from verse 8 to 11, and then in the  middle he speaks to the hosts from verses 12 to 14, and then at the end he actually speaks  to one smug guest and tells the great story of the parable, the great banquet, and at  the end of every one of these speeches, he shows us some way in which the gospel helps  us understand why it's very reasonable to give sacrifice. Today is Giving Tuesday, and we want you to know about a special opportunity we have  this year.

As you may know, gospel and life supports Redeemer City to City, a ministry dedicated to growing  gospel movements in cities around the world through church planting. City to City was co-founded by Tim Keller, and he cared deeply about this mission. And this coming year at a 2026 training event in Kenya, City to City will help train,  coach, and support two cohorts of 20 pastors planting churches all over Africa. This Giving Tuesday, we have a goal to raise $150,000 to help sponsor the church planters  attending this training intensive in Nairobi, Kenya, so that City to City can help and support  these church planters to start churches across Africa. This work is vital to the spread of the gospel in African cities from Kampala to Legos  to Johannesburg.

So as you think about how you may give on Giving Tuesday, please consider making a gift  to gospel in life. Every dollar we receive today will go directly to the work City to City is doing to help  start new churches in Africa in 2026. To make a gift today, visit gospelonlife.com slash Tuesday, again as gospelonlife.com slash  Tuesday. And thank you for your generous and faithful support of this ministry. Now, here's Dr.

Keller with the rest of today's message. Here's the first one. In verses 7 through 11, 7, we already saw this. He sees how the guests are picking places of honor at the table. And then he says this, when someone invites you to a feast, don't take the higher, the  more honored seats, let somebody there will ask you to move, and then you're humiliated.

Take the lower seats so somebody asks you, oh come on up here closer to me. Now at one level, this is just practical. What he's really saying is don't be the kind of person that suits your own horn. If you suit your own horn, people are not going to like you. And so the irony is if you're a self-promoter, you're always pushing yourself, look how good  I am.

I know how to do this. I know how to do this. Basically, the people who most promote themselves very often don't get promoted because  everybody else presents them. So what he's saying is be modest and by the quality of your life, if people will see  your quality and they'll speak well of you and that's better than if you speak well  of yourself. There's a lot of proverbs in chapter 26 and 27 that say the same thing, but Jesus is  not just saying this.

He's not just being pragmatic because when you get to verse 11, he is taking this principle  and he's showing that this is the core of spiritual reality. He says in verse 11, everyone, not just sometimes it's smart to not suit your own horn. Verse 11, he's getting cosmic here and he says everyone who exalts himself will be humbled  and he who humbles himself will be exalted. Now I would not mind at all to preach an entire sermon just on that text because what he's  trying to say is true in every single area of life, but ultimately at the core of spirituality  it's true and here's what that means. If you go to God and say, I deserve acceptance, you will be rejected because that shows you  do not know what's in your own heart.

But if you go to God and say I deserve rejection, please forgive me, you will get acceptance. And that's the gospel. Religion says you go to God and say I deserve acceptance, look at all the good deeds. But the gospel says if you say you deserve acceptance, you will get rejection, if you say you deserve  rejection, which means if with God you take the lower seat, he will accept you. He will exalt you because the gospel is he who humbles himself will be exalted and he  who exalts himself will be humbled.

If you exalt yourself, you'll be humbled because that's salvation by works. If you humble yourself, you'll be exalted because that's salvation by grace. But look at this term exalted, what does it mean that God will exalt you? James 4, 10, 1 Peter 5, 6 says if you humble yourself under the mighty hand of God, he will  exalt you. He will lift you up.

Jesus says to the Pharisees in John 12 verse 43, he says, you love the praise of men more  than the praise of God. And there it is. If you have the praise of God in your heart, if you've repented, if you've  taken the lower seat as it were with God, and he has exalted you and he has received you  and he's accepted you by grace, your heart is filled with the praise of God, a sense  of the light in you, a sense of his love, you know what that means? You have a new spiritual inner wealth, you have a new wealth inside, you have a real  riches, you have real value, you have real security, and you no longer look at your external  wealth the same, do you? Because money, if you don't have God in the center of your life, money is more than money.

It's security, it's self-esteem, I've got money, so I know, I'm important, I've got money,  so I know I'm secure. If you don't have God in the center of your life, if you don't have the praise of God  in the center of your life, you're like these people scrambling to get to the top, always  trying to connect to people who are a little better off than you, trying to get more money,  trying to get more security, trying to get more prosperity, trying to get more status,  but Jesus says, my disciples have the praise of God in the center of their being, they've  been exalted, and as a result they're not scrambling. You know what, there's something very balanced about verses 8, 9, and 10, what he's actually  saying there is, I don't want my people, I don't want my disciples to be passionate about  getting up the ladder and getting admitted into those inner circles. That should not drive your life, but if somebody invites you in, fine, he's, I'm not against  Christians being successful, it shouldn't be the passion of your life, if it happens,  that's great, but you should have such an incredible inner spiritual wealth that it makes  it easy for you to give away your external wealth because now your external wealth money  is just money to you, it's nothing more. So that's the first way in which the logic of the gospel makes giving away your money  in radical portions more sensible, but that's not all, secondly, the second speech we already  looked at, but we didn't look at the end of it.

It's in verse 12 to 14, and he's telling the host, don't invite these people, invite the  poor, the cripple, the lame in the blind, and you'll be blessed, and then he says, although  they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous. Again, I would love to spend a whole sermon on this, but I'll just tell you this. You know what he's saying? He says, here's the problem with living life the way Jesus says, you ought to live. You should be pouring yourself out for people.

You should be letting people into your life. You should be caring for people who are troubled. You should be going the extra mile to be friends to people who other people don't want  to be friends to. You should be giving a tremendous amount of your money away. You should be very involved in ministry and charity.

You know what that's going to mean? It means you're going to feel like, sometimes you're going to feel like I'm missing out. Other people have the money to do this. They go here. They do this.

I'm missing out. I'm not going to have this experience. I'm not going to go on that trip. I'm never going to be able to live like that. I'm missing out.

Jesus says, no, because of the resurrection, don't think you're missing out at all because  your future is not an ethereal future in which we're disembodied consciousnesses, kind  of floating around through all eternity, you're going to get bodies. The kingdom of God is a feast. The future kingdom of God is a feast. You're going to get bodies. Jesus Christ, the risen Jesus Christ was there.

They could feel Him. He ate a fish. And what that means is in the future, you're not going to miss out on anything. David Martin Lloyd-Jones, the great British preacher in the 20th century, mid-20th century,  once preached a sermon on 1 Corinthians 15 about the resurrection. And it moved me very much.

It's really sank deep into my heart. I have an old tape of it somewhere, and I have notes that I took on it. And here's what he says near the end. He says, and this is paraphrase, but these are my notes of what he said. He says, this is 1 Corinthians 15 about the resurrection of the body.

He says, the kingdom of God is a feast. You are going to have new bodies. Romans 8.11 says, if the Spirit that raised Jesus Christ is in you, He will also give life  to your mortal body through the Spirit in you. He says, this is Lloyd-Jones speaking. He says, you know as you begin to get older, you begin to think that your enemy is your  body.

But no, the enemy is in your body, and it will be driven out someday. You're going to get new bodies, resurrected bodies, healed bodies. Jonathan Edwards, the great New England minister, once said, right now in this body, this  version of our fallen body, our body subject to sin and disease and death, you've got five  senses, right? Five senses? But what about, maybe in our new bodies, we'll have 100?

There may be a thousand or 10,000, which means right now you are compared to what you're  going to be like in the resurrection. You're just a vegetable compared to what you will be. Your future self. And then he went on and said, Jesus Christ, the risen Christ ate a fish. Your future glory is not an ethereal esoteric form of impersonal consciousness.

You will eat in the kingdom of God. You will love. You will hug. You will be hugged in the kingdom of God. You will sing.

You'll dance. Your feet will touch the ground. Your feet. You'll eat and you'll sing and you'll love and you'll, in realms of power and glory  and satisfaction that you cannot now imagine, we will walk in the kingdom of God. We will not float over the kingdom of God.

We will march in the kingdom of God. We will eat and drink with the Son of Man. Are you afraid that you're going to miss out on some aspect of life because you are  giving so much away, you're giving so much of your time away, you're giving so much  of your money away? You will not miss out on anything. Why?

Because of the resurrection. They will not repay you in this life is what he's saying. But the resurrection, and that makes it very sensible to give away. You won't miss out on anything. Lastly, so see what he's saying.

He's saying, here's why you can give away your money. First of all, you've got a new internal wealth according to the gospel. Secondly, you've got a guaranteed future wealth according to the gospel. The resurrection, but one more thing, you need to see the sacrifice of Jesus Christ that  was required for you to get into the feast. Look at this great banquet story.

This is the last story. And actually, you could easily, again, preach a whole sermon just on the parable and many  people do. And Jesus is speaking to a smug guest at the banquet who hears him talking to the host  and says in verse 15, he says, blessed is the man who will eat at the feast in the kingdom  of God. Now, this is one of those social climbing, scrambling guests. And he clearly is sure he's going to be there.

And Jesus decides, okay, if you think the kingdom of God is a feast, right? Let me tell you what the kingdom of God is really like. He tells this parable to show this man how the kingdom of God's salvation really works. And the parable is, first, a great patron type person is throwing a huge feast. The word great there is the Greek word mega.

It's a mega feast. It's an incredible feast. Hundreds of guests, maybe thousands of guests, I don't know. And he sends out his first invitation and his first invitation is come all is now ready. The first set of invitees, and their invitees that ordinarily come to one of these, their  people of the social class of the, you know, the inviteer, they're too busy.

They've got good reasons. They're doing business deals. They got married. There's a good reasons, but they don't come. And that master of the feast says, in that case, let's take the people who would never  be qualified for a feast like this.

Let's go to the people who actually shouldn't be here. And first, he sends them out, notice, to the urban poor. Because first, he sends his servant out to the streets and the alleys, it says. And he brings in the poor and the crippled and the blind and the lame and they come in. But there's still seats open.

So then he sends them out to, it says at the very end, verse 25, go out to the roads and  the country lanes and make them come in so that my house will be full. Roads and country lanes, in the Old King James Bible, it says the highways and the hedges. Because at this point, he's sending the servant out to the rural poor, to the people along  country lanes who lived in the hedges along the lame. And those people were very desperate. Many of them were robbers.

They were dangerous. They were desperate. And they were more destitute than the urban poor. And notice, for the rural poor, he actually says go out to them and go out to the roads  and country lanes and make them come in. And the commentators are always amazed at this text.

It's a Greek word that really means drive them in, argue them in, debate with them, persuade  them to come in because they're not going to be persuaded, why not? Because the kingdom of God that Jesus Christ is depicting for us is a full finished salvation. See what the invitation is, come, all is now ready. That's salvation. Come, all is now ready.

Do you know what that means? The kingdom of God? If it's a feast, it's not a potluck dinner. Potluck means you bring something. Jesus says absolutely not.

The kingdom of God is finished. There is nothing to prepare. There is nothing to purchase. There's nothing to cook. It's all finished.

You just have to receive a free and full salvation. No wonder the people out in the highways and hedges can't believe it. The master says the servants, you're going to have to go out there and argue with them. They're never going to believe they're being invited to something like this. And I want you to see, because I think Jesus wants you to see, that that's you and me  out there in the hedges.

We don't really believe the gospel of grace. We have to drive it in. Frankly, many, many of us are still in the hedges. We still say, oh Lord, I know that somehow, if I live a good enough life, you'll bless  me. That means you're still in the hedges.

You have an understood the logic of the gospel, and we can't possibly come in. We don't deserve it. That's right. We don't deserve it, because verse 24 says, I tell you, one of those men who were invited  and turned down the invitation will get a taste of my banquet. But verse 24 points me to Jesus, points us to Jesus, you know why?

There's people on the outside, they're the proud, they're the ones who were too proud  to come, and there's people on the inside, they were the humble. But why are we able to come in just with humility? Why are we able to get a full, free banquet just because we're willing to say, oh Lord, I'm  not qualified? It's not humility that earns that banquet. It's what Jesus Christ did on the cross.

At the end of, in Matthew 25, there's two parables. And each parable talks about judgment day. And in one parable, the Lord on judgment day says to some people, well done, good and faithful  servant, enter into my feast, the joy of my yearmaster. And to another set of people, in another parable, the Lord on judgment day says, depart from  me, cursed into everlasting fire. Well done, good and faithful servant, come into the feast.

But apart from me, he cursed, you have no taste of my feast. Get out. Jesus was the one person who loved God with all his heart, soul, strength, and mind, loved  his neighbor as himself, lived a perfect life. And at the end of his life, he should have heard God say to him, well done, good and faithful  servant, enter into the joy of your master. But instead, we know what he heard on the cross.

Why did Jesus say, my God, my God, why has thou forsaken me? Because he was hearing in his soul, God say, depart from me, he cursed into everlasting  fire. He was thrown out. He was cast out, which is what we deserve, so we can be brought in. He heard, depart from me, he cursed into everlasting fire, so that we could hear when all we have  to do is repent.

All we have to do is just say, oh, I'm not, you know, I'm unqualified. And God will say, well done, good and faithful servant, enter into the joy of your master. Why? Because it's not our humility that earns the banquet, it's what Jesus Christ did. He was cast out so that we could be brought in.

He sacrificed everything, and that's the final logic of the gospel, piece of the gospel  that helps us with our giving. When you realize that Jesus Christ sacrificed to give us life, you will start to say, how  can I sacrifice to give other people life? I live by the sacrifice of Christ. It's because of his sacrifice that I live. Now sacrifice your money to ministry so people spiritually live, to charity so people physically  live who are hungry.

By Jesus' sacrifice, you live now by your sacrifice, not of your blood, but of your money  other people can live. And the more you see that you live by Christ sacrifice, the more reasonable it will be for  you to give sacrificially. So it's the inner wealth that we have, it's the guarantee of future wealth that we have  because of what Jesus Christ did, though he was rich, he became poor, though he was an insider,  he became an outsider, though he had the highest seat, he was thrown out of the feast, so that  you could be brought in. And therefore, sacrificial giving is just reasonable. Let's wrestle with this together as a community.

Some of you are guests, probably, you don't even, I'm not obviously after your money because  you don't even live here. Some of you, in fact, and here's the other thing I want you to know, we'll talk about  this next week. I'm not here to say, you now because of this sermon, here's your application, give money  to Redeemer. First, a lot of you don't go to Redeemer, you're not members of Redeemer. I don't want you to think about that for a second.

I want you to think, I'm asking, here's another minister asking me for money. I want you to say, what should my attitude toward my money be in light of the gospel? And that's a frightening, frightening question to ask because as John Newton said, I really  don't know how to quite get my hands, my head around what Jesus is saying here, but I  just know this, I need to be giving a lot more than I am now, and I think that's right. Let's pray. Our Father, help us to be conformed to the image of your Son, though he was rich, he became  poor, though he was an insider, he was cast out.

And when we see that, that has got to affect the way in which we think about our funds and  about our money and about our lifestyle and about how we spend it, I pray, Lord, that  you would enable us to, as a community, be famous for a generosity to each other and  to the city. And I pray that you would more and more conform this into the image of your Son who came  not to be served, but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many. It's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

### 引言：圣经中金钱的重要性

为什么圣经如此频繁地谈论金钱？我们如何思考和使用金钱是圣经中最常见的主题之一。圣经告诉我们一个惊人的事实：**如果不把金钱和对金钱的态度交给上帝，你就无法体验深刻的属灵成长。** 听听 Tim Keller 如何向我们展示，慷慨对基督徒来说不是可选的，而是真信仰的重要标志。

> “今晚的经文来自路加福音第十四章第七至二十四节。”

### 第一部分：惊人的牺牲性给予标准

#### 1. 婚宴的比喻

当他注意到客人们如何选择桌上的尊贵位置时，他给他们讲了这个比喻。当有人邀请你参加婚宴时，不要坐在尊贵的位置上，因为可能有比你更尊贵的人被邀请。如果是这样，邀请你们两人的主人会来对你说，把这个人的座位让给他。然后你会感到羞愧，只能坐在最不重要的位置上。但当你被邀请时，坐在最低的位置上，这样当你的主人来时，他会对你说，朋友，上来坐在更好的位置上。**因为凡自高的，必降为卑；自卑的，必升为高。**

#### 2. 赞助系统

当耶稣对他的主人说，你设午宴或晚宴时，不要邀请你的朋友、兄弟或亲戚，或你的富邻居。如果你这样做，他们可能会回请你，这样你就得到了回报。但当你设宴时，要邀请贫穷的、残疾的、瘸腿的、盲眼的，你就会有福。虽然他们不能回报你，但在义人的复活时，你会得到回报。

### 第二部分：福音的逻辑使牺牲性给予合理

#### 1. 福音的内在财富

在第七至十一节，耶稣看到客人们如何选择桌上的尊贵位置。他说，当有人邀请你参加宴会时，不要坐在更高、更尊贵的座位上，以免有人让你移动，然后你会感到羞愧。坐在较低的座位上，以便有人邀请你，上来坐得更近。

#### 2. 复活的未来财富

他告诉主人，不要邀请这些人，而是邀请贫穷的、残疾的、瘸腿的、盲眼的，你就会有福，然后他说，虽然他们不能回报你，但在义人的复活时，你会得到回报。

#### 3. 耶稣基督的牺牲

看看这个伟大的宴会故事。耶稣对宴会上的一个自满的客人说，他听到耶稣对主人说话，并在第十五节说，他说，在神的国里吃饭的人有福了。

### 结论：慷慨的呼召

让我们作为一个社区一起思考这个问题。你们中有些人可能是客人，我显然不是在追求你们的钱，因为你们甚至不住在这里。事实上，这里还有另一件事我想让你们知道，我们下周会谈到这个。我不是在这里说，因为这篇讲道，这就是你的应用，给 Redeemer 捐钱。首先，你们中很多人不去 Redeemer，你们不是 Redeemer 的成员。我不想让你们考虑这个。我想让你们思考，我在问，另一个牧师在向我索要钱。我想让你们说，我对金钱的态度应该是什么，在福音的光照下？这是一个令人恐惧的问题，因为正如 John Newton 所说，我真的不知道如何完全理解耶稣在这里所说的，但我知道，我现在需要比现在给予更多，我认为这是对的。

让我们祷告。

我们的父，帮助我们被塑造成你儿子的形象，虽然他富有，却变得贫穷，虽然他是内部人士，却被抛弃。当我们看到这一点时，这必须影响我们对资金、金钱、生活方式以及如何使用它的思考方式。我祈求主，你能使我们作为一个社区，以对彼此和城市的慷慨而闻名。我祈求你越来越多地将我们塑造成你的儿子的形象，他来不是要受服侍，而是要服侍，并为多人舍命作为赎价。奉耶稣的名祷告。阿门。

## Chinese Transcript / 中文

今天晚上的经文选自路加福音第 14 章 7–24 节。当耶稣注意到客人怎样拣选首位的时候，就对他们讲了一个比喻。当你被人请去赴婚宴的时候，不要坐在首位上，恐怕有比你尊贵的人也被请了来。那请你和他的人过来，对你说：“让座给这位吧。”你就要羞羞愧愧地退到末位上去了。

你被请的时候，应当去坐在末位上，好叫那请你的人来对你说：“朋友，请上坐。”那时你在同席的人面前就有光彩了。因为凡自高的必降为卑，自卑的必升为高。耶稣又对请他的那人说：“你摆设午饭或晚宴的时候，不要只请你的朋友、弟兄、亲属，或富足的邻舍，恐怕他们也请你回去，作为报答。

你摆设宴席的时候，倒要请那贫穷的、残废的、瘸腿的、瞎眼的，你就有福了。因为他们没有什么可报答你，将来义人复活的时候，你必得着报答。”同席的人中有一个人听见这话，就对耶稣说：“在神国里吃饭的人有福了！”耶稣对他说：“有一人摆设大筵席，请了许多客人。到了坐席的时候，打发仆人去对所请的人说：‘请来吧，样样都齐备了。’

众人一口同辞推托。头一个说：‘我买了一块地，必须去看看，请你准我辞了。’又有一个说：‘我买了五对牛，要去试一试，请你准我辞了。’又有一个说：‘我才娶了妻，所以不能去。’那仆人回来，把这事都告诉了主人。家主就动怒，对仆人说：‘快出去，到城里的大街小巷，把贫穷的、残废的、瞎眼的、瘸腿的都领来。’仆人说：‘主啊，你所吩咐的已经办了，还有空座。’主人对仆人说：‘你出去到路上和篱笆那里，勉强人进来，坐满我的屋子。

我告诉你们，先前所请的人，没有一个得尝我的宴席。’这是主的话。

我们这六月在讲一个短系列，主题是：基督徒应当怎样看待自己的金钱和财物。我们是从路加的著作来看这个题目。本月我们要看的经文，有三段出自路加福音，还有一段在下周出自路加也写的《使徒行传》，因为路加在这个主题上说了太多的内容。我们把六月选出来讲钱，是因为当一个牧师在一个会众当中讲到金钱时，往往教会里正好在搞什么筹款：可能是年度经常预算到年底了，或者是有特别奉献在进行。

当你一讲钱，就说：“看，你需要为这个事奉献、为那个事奉献。”听众很自然就把注意力集中在“这个”“那个”具体的项目、具体的需要上，而不是退一步来问：好，神究竟要我整体上怎样思考金钱？我对钱应该有什么样的态度？我的奉献要怎么和我的花费联系起来？我该在自己身上花多少？我该为别人、为神的工作奉献多少？

这就是我们六月要看的，因为圣经里关于这件事的内容实在太多了。所以，首先，其实这篇讲道我只有两个重点，不是三个，真的只有两个。所以你也别指望因此就能早点散会，但总之，就是两个。第一个重点是：在这一章的中间，耶稣基督为牺牲式的奉献立下了一个惊人的标准。真的是惊人，惊人到会让我们觉得不合理。然后第二个重点，我要给你看，耶稣如何说明这种奉献其实是非常合理的——因为福音本身有它的逻辑。

所以第一，在这里，耶稣给他的百姓、他的门徒，为他们的牺牲式奉献立了一个惊人的标准；第二，他怎样用福音的逻辑来解释、来奠定这个标准，使之合情合理。我们先来看这段经文中间、耶稣所说的那个了不起的标准。经文说，“耶稣又对请他的主人说。”谁是这个主人呢？耶稣是被请到一位非常显赫的人家里。我们读的经文段落里没提到这一点，可是在本章一开头就交代了。

耶稣被请到一个大筵席，在一位显赫人家里，很多客人一同坐席。你看第 7 节说：“耶稣见所请的客拣择首位，就用比喻对他们说。”这是一个典型的筵席场景，人们都想坐得离主人越近越好。然后，耶稣对主人说：“你摆设午饭或晚饭的时候，不要请你的朋友、弟兄、亲属和富足的邻舍。”而这些人，正是那一席上的人。

要明白这一段在说什么，我得先给你一点背景介绍。整个希腊罗马世界是靠“庇护—门客制度”（patronage system）运转的。这并不是完全陌生，因为今天世界上还有不少地方有类似的制度。那时的庇护制度是这样的：在每一个社区里，都有一些地位显赫、极有钱势的人。如果你想改善你的处境，想往上爬一点点，你就必须让其中某一个人成为你的“庇护人”。一旦那个成了你的庇护人，他就会借钱给你、送礼物给你、为你开门铺路。但作为交换，你就成了他网络中的一分子。

庇护人身边聚集着一圈“受宠者”（favorites）。所谓“受宠者”，就是常常接受他恩惠的人。而庇护人与受宠者组成的这个网络，在一个社区里可以促成很多事情，因为你有一大群欠你人情的人。你总能在各样事情上得到方便，各种事都会给你“开绿灯”。庇护人能在社区里促成很多事，因为他手下有一大群“自己人”，可以帮他润滑各种关系，搞政治上的运作之类的。

那么，这样的筵席到底在干什么呢？在筵席上，人们彼此认识、互相结交。要么你是为了维持你现有的社会位置——庇护人和受宠者聚在一起，巩固他们的关系；要么你就是在努力结交新的关系：你要认识新的庇护人，要往上爬。所以，谁会来参加这样的筵席？当然是非常重要的人。你必须请得起那些富足的邻舍，必须请得起至少与你同阶层、甚至比你更高阶层的人。

因此，这些筵席绝不只是简单的聚会，它们极其重要。而且也极其昂贵。但没关系，因为借着这些宴席，你可以巩固已有的合作关系、达成新的交易，把人纳入你的网络。结果是，这些宴席“稳赚不赔”。宴席固然很贵，但总是“回本”的。它很贵，却也“值回票价”。又好玩，又奢华，又昂贵，但对你也非常划算——这就是整个制度。

耶稣基督到了这个庇护人家里，对他说了一句惊人的话：“你摆设午饭或晚饭的时候，不要请你的朋友、弟兄、亲属和富足的邻舍”，也就是眼前这些人。“若请了他们，他们也会请你，作为报答。”当然了，这正是庇护制度的运作方式。接着他又说：“但我希望你这样——这是我对门徒的要求：你摆设筵席的时候，要请那贫穷的、残废的、瘸腿的、瞎眼的，你就有福了。”

那么，先看他究竟在说什么，然后再看这话意味着什么。首先，他在说什么呢？乍一读，你和我会以为，耶稣是在说：你永远不要请朋友到家里来吃饭。那好，我们现在就结束讲道，来祷告吧。耶稣说，不要请你的朋友来吃饭——经文里不就这么写的吗？“你摆设午饭或晚饭的时候，不要请你的朋友、弟兄、亲属。”要请穷人。这是什么意思？

你需要理解希伯来语世界里的语用成语（Semitic idioms）。成语你都知道，每一种语言里都有成语；一种语言里的成语，对那种语言里的人很自然，但当你把它直译到另一种语言里，如果那种语言没有这样的用法，那直译出来的意思就会非常奇怪，因为你把它当成字面意思了。

如果你把这句话照字面去读，它就很难理解。但如果你再看本章稍后的一个例子——同样的语用用法——就会更清楚。在第 26 节，耶稣说：“人到我这里来，若不恨自己的父母，就不能作我的门徒。”同一个成语：“恨父母，来跟从我。”你会说：“哦，真的吗？难道这意思就是：你们记得那十条诫命里，有一条提到要孝敬父母吗？把那条忘了吧。”耶稣是这个意思吗？难道他的意思是说：把那条诫命抛到脑后？当然不是。

那他在说什么？这是一个成语。字面上虽然说“恨自己的父母，来跟从我”，他真正的意思不是：你不应该爱你的父母，也不是说：你爱父母爱得太多，不能这么爱。不是。耶稣的意思只是：你必须更加爱我，远远超过爱你的父母。你要爱我多到一个地步，以至于你爱我的程度，使你对父母的爱看起来好像“恨”一样。也就是说，当这个成语说：“不要爱父母，要爱我”的时候，真正的意思是：你应当更深地爱我，而不是说你不该爱父母。

同样，当这段话说：“你摆设筵席，不要请朋友”的时候，它并不是说：不要做那些维持你生活地位所需要的事；不要娱乐；不要休闲；不要去餐厅吃饭；不要买漂亮的衣服，以保持你在社会上的位置。所有这些，都是今天相当于当年的那些宴席的东西——对我们今天来说，这就是当年的娱乐休闲。他并不是在说：完全不要这些。他是在说：你在施给穷人和福音事工上的奉献——也就是你借着事工，把属灵的生命带给人；借着慈善，把物质的生命带给人（饿了就喂他）——你在事工和慈善上的奉献，应该远远超过你在娱乐、休闲、漂亮衣服、度假等方面的花费。这些就是当年筵席所代表的东西。他们没有我们今天的度假，那就是他们的“节庆娱乐”。

耶稣的意思不是说：你从来不能花钱在自己身上；而是说：你给在事工和慈善上的钱，应该远远多过你花在自己享乐上的钱。那这到底意味着什么？这就是他在说的。那么，这话带来的含义是什么呢？含义是：你在事工和慈善上的奉献必须有优先顺序，而且必须是牺牲式的。

你好好想想。顺带说一句，我其实这几年准备这篇讲道之前，从来没有真正意识到这段经文的含义。头一层，他在谈“优先级”。当他说“恨父母爱我”的时候，他并不是说：“你不该爱父母”，而是说：“你必须更爱我，我才是优先。如果你不得不在我和父母之间二选一，你要选择我。”耶稣是不是这意思？当然是。

那他在这里说的也是一样的事。他其实是在说：你的奉献应该成为“刚性支出”，而那花在自己身上的钱，其实才是可商量、可变动的。要把两者调换过来。对我们多数人来说，现在的状况是这样的：我们心里有一些财务目标，有一些生活方式的目标。我们想过某种样子的生活：想去某些地方度假，想买某些衣服，想做一些事情。如果我们手上有足够的钱，既能实现这些生活方式，又能给出一点事工和慈善的奉献，那我们就会去做。但在这种模式下，奉献是“可选项”，而花在自己身上的钱才是“优先项”，才是“刚需”。

耶稣却说：把这两个调过来。你要在奉献上“看得死”，宁可在自己身上“砍掉”。这意味着，这段经文的含义不仅是：你的奉献要有优先顺序，而且还必须是有牺牲的。这里的教导，与圣经其他关于奉献的教导是连在一起的。

在旧约，神给信徒关于奉献的标准非常清楚：十分之一，十一奉献。也就是说，收入的十分之一，要给利未人、会幕、穷人，给福音事工和慈善。可是，当你来到新约的时候，只有一处经文，耶稣明说“你们当纳十分之一”。那就在路加福音 11 章 42–43 节，他在那里谈到法利赛人怎样献十一。他说：“这些原是你们当行的。”所以，耶稣并不反对十一奉献。

然而，新约其他地方几乎不再提十一奉献这个词。取而代之的，是这样的话，比如哥林多后书 8 章——保罗在那儿劝哥林多的基督徒，为耶路撒冷的穷人捐钱。他提到马其顿的基督徒已经捐了。他在第 3 节说：“他们是按着力量，而且也过了力量。”这是什么意思？你和我常常说：“哎呀，我很想多给一点，可是我承担不起。”其实我们真正的意思是：“我承担不起在不牺牲我自己生活方式的前提下多给。”可问题就在这里。

我相信，在旧约里，十一奉献（十分之一）是一个起码标准。耶稣说，那是一个很好的起点。但基本上，新约在说的是：你怎么知道自己奉献得够多了？答案是：必须到一个“会痛”的地步。也就是说，你必须因此做出某些牺牲。你必须因为奉献，而有一些不能做的事情；有一些地方你不能去；有一些消费你不能享受——因为你在给出去。你给得多到一个地步，它对你是有刺痛感的，这才是标准。

这就是耶稣在这里讲的。这是一个令人震惊的标准：他对一个“庇护人”说：“我不希望你摆筵席的时候只请你的富足邻舍和朋友，我要你去请穷人。”你要明白，在那种社交场合下，如果你照常请与你同阶层的人吃饭，借着那样的安排，你能保持你的关系网，能维持你的生意，那固然要花很多钱，但算得上是一种投资，是会“回本”的。“他们也会请你，作报答”，你会收回某种意义上的“本钱”。可是，如果你真的摆一桌丰盛的筵席去请穷人、残废的、瘸腿的、瞎眼的，那就是把钱一股脑儿“扔出去”，一点都收不回来。

换句话说，耶稣是在说：有一种花钱的方式是不牺牲的，有一种花钱的方式是牺牲式的，而他要的，是后者——牺牲。

那么，这听起来是不是不合理？是相当前卫、相当震撼的。就我自己看，也会因此审视自己；我也要和这段经文搏斗，我绝不是站在这里说：“看，我都做到了，你们也该做到。”不，我和你们一样，都需要站在这段经文底下，让它来光照我们。

这段经文很少被当成“财务管家”（stewardship）经文来讲。但这些年我越来越看见，它在讲什么。十八世纪那位写《奇异恩典》的英国圣公会牧师约翰·牛顿，对这段经文感到很不安。他说，大致意思是：无论我怎么读这段经文，无论我怎么试图“和稀泥”，我都知道耶稣不是真的在说“你永远不能见你的朋友”这类不近人情的话。但无论我怎样读，它都意味着：我应该比现在给出更多的钱。

好，这是不是不合理呢？如果你真正明白福音，就不会这样觉得。接下来我要给你看三件事：耶稣怎样在本章结尾的三个“讲话段落”里，用福音来解释：这样的用钱方式，为什么是非常合理的。这是一段长经文，其中有三段“讲话”。最开始，他对所有客人说话（第 8–11 节）；中间，他对主人说话（第 12–14 节）；最后，他对一个自鸣得意的客人讲话，讲了“大神筵”的比喻（第 15 节以后）。在每一段讲话的结尾，他都指出：福音如何帮助我们看见，牺牲式的奉献是合理的。

第一段，我们已经读过，就是第 7–11 节。第 7 节说，耶稣见所请的客拣择首位，然后他就说了这么一个比喻：你被人请去赴婚宴，不要去坐在高位上，免得有人来叫你让座，你就当众蒙羞；要坐在末位，好叫主人来对你说：“朋友，请上坐。”

表面看，这不过是一点生活智慧。耶稣好像在说：不要做那种总在自我吹嘘的人。如果你总吹嘘自己，人们会讨厌你。结果很讽刺：那些总宣传自己、总强调“你看我多能干”的人，往往并不会真正被别人提拔，因为大家都厌烦他们。所以耶稣是在说：要谦卑，让你的生命品质自己说话，让别人来肯定你，这比你自己吹自己强太多了。箴言第 26、27 章里有很多类似的教导。但耶稣不只是讲“为人处世的智慧”。

因为到了第 11 节，他把这个原则推到一个“属灵现实的核心”层面：“因为凡自高的必降为卑，自卑的必升为高。”他在谈“所有人”（everyone），不只是说：“有的时候，低调一点更聪明。”第 11 节，他是在谈宇宙层面的规律。他说：“凡自高的必降为卑，自卑的必升为高。”

我其实一点也不介意花整整一篇讲道，就讲这节经文。因为耶稣在这里说的真理，适用于生命的每一个领域；但在属灵生命的核心，它尤其成立。这意味着什么？这意味着，如果你来到神面前说：“我配得被接纳”，你就会被拒绝——因为这说明你根本不了解自己心里有什么。但如果你来到神面前说：“我配得被拒绝，求你怜悯我、赦免我”，你就会被接纳。这就是福音。

宗教说：你去见神，要说：“我配得被接纳，看我做了多少好事。”但福音说：如果你说“我配得被接纳”，你就会被拒绝；如果你说“我配得被拒绝”，也就是你在神面前坐在末位，你就会被接纳，因为“自卑的必升为高”。如果你自高自大，就会被降为卑，因为那是靠行为得救；如果你谦卑自己，就会被升高，因为那是靠恩典得救。

注意这里的“升高”（exalted）这个词。神把人升高、抬举起来，到底是什么意思？雅各书 4:10 和彼得前书 5:6 都说：“务要在主大能的手下自卑，到了时候他必叫你们升高。”神要“升高”你，抬举你。耶稣在约翰福音 12:43 里对法利赛人说：“你们爱人的荣耀过于爱神的荣耀。”就是这个意思。如果神的荣耀在你心里，如果你已经悔改，在神面前坐在“末位”，被他高举——也就是被他白白接纳，你的心里就会被神的荣耀所充满，被他喜悦你的心意所充满，被他的爱所充满。你知道这意味着什么吗？你有了一个新的属灵内在财富，你里面有了真实的财富、真实的价值感、真实的安全感；你就不会再用同样的眼光看你的外在财富了。

因为，如果你的生命中心没有神，没有神的荣耀在你心里，金钱就不只是金钱。钱变成了安全感，变成了自我价值。你会说：“我有钱，所以知道自己有分量；我有钱，所以知道自己安全。”如果你的生命中心没有神，如果你心里不是被神的荣耀占据，你就像这些抢着坐到上席的人一样，总是在向上爬、总是在拼命结交比你更好一点的人，总是想要更多的钱、更多的安全感、更多的繁荣、更多的地位。但耶稣说，他的门徒在生命中心有神的荣耀，他们已经被神升高，因此他们不必再“挤上去”。

你注意，8–10 节的教导非常平衡。他其实是在说：“我不希望我的人、我的门徒，把‘往上爬、被接纳进核心圈子’当成生命的激情所在。那不应该驱动你的生活。”但他也不是说：“基督徒不能成功。”不是的。如果有人邀请你进核心圈子，那很好，他说“可以”。耶稣不是反对基督徒成功，而是说：成功不该是你生命的终极激情。如果发生了，那很好；如果没有，也没什么，因为你里面已经有足够的属灵财富。

结果是什么呢？结果就是，你更容易把外在的财富给出去，因为对你来说，外在财富——钱——就只是钱，不再意味着更多的东西。这是福音的逻辑如何让我们更容易慷慨施予的第一个方面。但还不止于此，第二点：我们刚才已经看过第二段讲话，但还没有看它的结尾。就是第 12–14 节，耶稣对主人说：“不要请这些人，要请穷人、残废的、瘸腿的、瞎眼的，你就有福了”，然后他说：“因为他们没有什么可报答你，将来义人复活的时候，你必得着报答。”

同样，我很乐意用整篇讲道来讲这几节，但这里先给你一个重点。耶稣在说什么？他说，照我教你们活的方式去活，会有一个问题。那是什么呢？那就是：你必须把自己倒空，你要让别人进入你的生命，你要关怀受苦的人，你要多走一里路，去作那些别人不想作的人的朋友，你要把大量金钱给出去，你要非常多地投入在事工和慈善中。你知道这意味着什么吗？这意味着，有时候你会觉得自己“错过了很多”。你会说：“别人有钱做这个，他们能去那里玩，他们能这么生活；我错过了。我不会有这种经历，我不会去那种旅行，我永远没有办法那样生活。我错过了。”

耶稣说：“不。”因为有复活。所以你一点都不会“错过”。因为你的未来，不是那种飘在空中的未来，不是变成某种“纯意识”在宇宙中游荡；你会有身体。神的国是筵席，将来的神国是筵席。你会有身体。复活的耶稣就站在那里，门徒可以摸到他，他吃了一块鱼。这意味着什么呢？这意味着将来，你什么都不会错过。

二十世纪中期那位英国大布道家马丁·劳埃德—琼斯（David Martyn Lloyd-Jones）曾经在哥林多前书 15 章“身体复活”这一段上讲过一篇讲道，那篇讲道对我影响很大，深深地印在我心里。我在某个角落里还有那篇讲道的老录音带，也有我当年记的笔记。他在讲道后半部分这样说（我现在是概述，但大意是这样）：

他说，哥林多前书 15 章告诉我们：神的国是一场筵席，你会有一个新的身体。罗马书 8:11 说，使耶稣从死里复活的灵，若住在你们里面，那使基督耶稣从死里复活的，也必借着住在你们里面的圣灵，使你们必死的身体又活过来。劳埃德—琼斯说，你知道，当你渐渐变老的时候，你会开始觉得你的“敌人”就是你的身体。但他提醒我们：不，敌人是在你的身体里，总有一天会被完全驱逐。你将得到一个新的身体，一个复活的身体，一个得着医治的身体。

美国清教徒神学家乔纳森·爱德华兹曾经说：现在，在我们这个堕落的、会生病、会死亡的身体里，我们有五种感官，对吧？五种感官？但将来，在我们新的身体里，或许会有 100 种感官，或许有 1000 种，甚至 1 万种。也就是说，相较于你将来在复活里会是怎样的人，现在的你就像一棵“蔬菜”一样——你现在的感知能力，与将来相比，几乎是“植物人”的程度。你复活以后那种荣耀状态，是你现在无法想像的。

他又说，耶稣复活以后吃了一块鱼。你的将来不会是某种虚无飘渺、抽象的意识形态，你会吃饭。你会爱人，你会拥抱别人，也会被人拥抱。你会唱歌，会跳舞。你的脚会踩在地上——是你的脚。你会吃喝，你会歌唱，你会爱、会被爱，你将在一种现在完全无法想像的能力和荣耀的领域里生活。我们要在神的国里行走，不是飘在神的国之上，我们会与人子一同坐席吃喝。

所以，你现在是否害怕，因为你给出太多时间、金钱，你怕自己会错过某些人生体验？别人有时间，有钱去做某些事情，而你因为服侍和奉献，做不了？耶稣说：你不会错过任何东西。为什么？因为有复活。“他们在今世不能报答你”，他在说的就是这个。但将来的复活，就是你的“报答”。这使得你现在给出去，是再合理不过的事。你不会错过任何东西。

最后再看第三点。你看，他在说什么？他说，你可以给出去，很有道理，因为第一，你在福音里得着了一种“新的内在财富”；第二，你在福音里得着了一种“必然临到的将来财富”，就是复活。但还有第三点：你必须看见，为了让你能进这筵席，耶稣基督付出了什么样的牺牲。

来看看这“大神筵”的比喻，这是第三段。事实上，这个比喻本身就可以讲一整篇道，很多人也确实这么做。耶稣是对那位自鸣得意的客人说话的。那个客人听见耶稣对主人说的话，就在第 15 节说：“在神国里吃饭的有福了！”他显然很确定自己一定会在那里。耶稣于是说：好，你既然提到“神国是一场筵席”，让我来告诉你，神国真正是什么样的。接下来，他借这个比喻告诉这个人：神国——也就是救恩——是怎样运作的。

比喻的大意是这样的：首先，有一位像庇护人一样的大主人，摆设了一场极大的筵席。这里的“大神筵”，原文用的是“mega”这个词，是一场“mega 宴席”。是巨大、盛大的宴席，数百人、甚至上千人参加也说不定。他先发出第一轮请帖：“请来吧，现在一切都预备好了。”第一批的受邀者，是在那种场合下通常会被邀请的人，是与那个主人同一社会阶层的人。但这些人都各有打算，都“很忙”：做买卖、谈生意、结婚等等。他们看上去都有“好理由”，但就是不肯来。

于是，这位摆筵席的主人说：既然如此，那就去请那些从来没有资格参加这种筵席的人吧——那些根本不配得在这里的人。首先，他打发仆人去到街市和小巷，也就是去找城里的穷人——“贫穷的、残废的、瞎眼的、瘸腿的”。他们进来了，可还是有许多空位。于是主人再次打发仆人去，这次是到“路上和篱笆那里”，也就是旧译本里所谓的“道路和篱笆”（highways and hedges）。这次是去到乡间小路上，去找住在篱笆边上的人——也就是乡间的穷人。

那些人往往极其绝望，其中不少是强盗，是危险的、非常穷困潦倒的人，比城里的穷人还要穷。注意，到了这一步，主人对仆人的吩咐变了。他说：“你出去到路上和篱笆那里，勉强人进来，使我的屋子坐满。”原文这个“勉强”，是一个很强的词，意思是“催逼、敦促、和他们辩论、坚持不懈地劝他们进来”，因为他们不会轻易相信这一切。为什么？因为耶稣在这里描绘的神国，是一种“完备的、完工的救恩”。你注意，邀请的内容是：“请来吧，样样都齐备了。”这就是救恩：“来吧，一切都已经预备好了。”

你知道这意味着什么吗？如果神的国是一场筵席，它绝对不是“百乐餐”（potluck）。所谓“百乐餐”，就是每个人都要带一道菜来。耶稣说，绝不是这样。神的国是一切完备的筵席，没有任何东西需要你来预备，没有任何菜需要你来买、来煮，一切都已经预备好了。你只要来，白白领受这完备的救恩。

也难怪那些住在篱笆边上的人不会相信这样的事。主人说：你得出去不断地和他们解释、劝服他们，否则他们绝不会相信自己真的被邀请参加这样的一场筵席。我也要你看见——我想耶稣也要你看见——那些“篱笆边上的人”，其实就是你和我。我们天生并不真正相信“恩典的福音”。我们得被“勉强进来”。事实上，我们许多人成为基督徒多年，心里还住在“篱笆外”。我们仍然说：“主啊，我知道，只要我过得足够好，你就会祝福我。”这就说明，我们还在篱笆外面，还没明白福音的逻辑。我们怎可能进去？我们不配进去。——对，这正是关键：我们确实不配。第 24 节说：“我告诉你们，先前所请的人，没有一个得尝我的宴席。”

第 24 节也把我们指向耶稣：你会发现，外面有一群人，是骄傲的，是因为骄傲而拒绝邀请的人；里面则是一群谦卑的人。但我们为什么只要谦卑，就可以进去？为什么我们只要肯承认“我不配”，就能坐在“完全免费的筵席”前？难道是我们的“谦卑”赚来了这顿筵席吗？当然不是。是耶稣在十字架上所成就的一切。

在马太福音 25 章里，耶稣讲了两个比喻，每个比喻都提到审判日。在一个比喻里，审判日那位主对一些人说：“好，你这又良善又忠心的仆人，可以进来享受你主人的快乐。”在另一个比喻里，那位主对另一些人说：“你们这被咒诅的人，离开我，进入永火里去。”一边是：“好，你这又良善又忠心的仆人，进来享受筵席”；另一边是：“离开我，你这被咒诅的”。

耶稣是那唯一一位用全心、全性、全意、全力爱神，又爱邻舍如同自己的人，他过的是完美的一生。在他生命的尽头，他理应听见父神对他说：“好，你这又良善又忠心的仆人，可以进来享受你主人的快乐。”但我们知道，他在十字架上听见的不是这个。为什么耶稣在十字架上呼喊：“我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？”因为他在灵魂深处听见的，是那句审判日的话：“你们这被咒诅的人，离开我，进入永火里去。”他被赶出去了，他被丢弃了——那正是我们应得的——使我们可以被接纳。

他本应听见的是：“好，你这又良善又忠心的仆人，进来享受你主人的快乐。”但他却在十字架上听见：“离开我，你这被咒诅的，进入永火里去。”而我们，只要悔改，只要承认“我不配”，就会听见那句：“好，你这又良善又忠心的仆人，进来享受你主人的快乐。”为什么？因为使我们得以进入宴席的，不是我们的谦卑，而是耶稣基督所做成的。他被赶出筵席，使我们得以被带进来。

他为了我们被赶出，他为我们失去了一切，他从最高的座位被丢弃在筵席之外，使我们这些本该在外面的，得以被带进来。这是福音逻辑里关于奉献的最后一块拼图。当你意识到，耶稣基督为要赐你生命而牺牲自己，你就会开始问：“我又怎能不牺牲，去把生命带给别人呢？”你是靠基督的牺牲而活的，是因为他的牺牲，你才有生命。现在，就用你的牺牲——不是流血的牺牲，而是金钱上的牺牲——去使别人活：借着奉献给事工，使人得着属灵的生命；借着奉献给慈善，使人得着物质上的生命、在饥饿中被喂养。

你越看见自己是靠基督的牺牲而活，你就越觉得“牺牲式的奉献”是再合理不过的。我们在福音里得着了新的内在财富，也得着了将来必得的荣耀财富——复活的盼望。那位本来富足的，为我们成了贫穷；那位本来是“内部人”的，为我们成了“外人”；那位本来坐在最高位上的，被赶出筵席，使你我得以被领进来。因此，牺牲式的奉献，不只是“高标准”，更是“合情合理”。

让我们作为一个群体，一起来与这段经文搏斗吧。你们当中有些人今天是第一次来，或者只是偶然来访，我显然不是在向你要钱，因为你根本不住在这里；你也不是我们教会的会友。甚至就算你是会友，我今天也不是要说：“所以，应用就很简单：给 Redeemer 捐钱。”不，很多人并不属于我们的教会。我不希望你心里想：“又有一个牧师来向我要钱了。”我真正希望你问的，是这样一个问题：“在福音的光照之下，我应该以什么样的态度看待我的金钱？”这是一个让人有点害怕的问题。正如约翰·牛顿说的：我其实不知道该怎么完全弄懂耶稣在这里说的所有含义，但我只知道一件事：我应该比现在给出更多。

我们一起祷告。父啊，求你帮助我们效法你的儿子的形象：他本来富足，却为我们成了贫穷；他本是内部人，却被赶到门外。当我们看见这一点时，它必定要影响我们看待钱财、生活方式、消费选择的方式。求你使我们这个群体，在彼此之间、在这座城市里，都因慷慨而闻名。求你使我们越来越效法那位“来不是要受人的服侍，乃是要服侍人，并且舍命作多人的赎价”的儿子。奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。

今天晚上的经文选自路加福音第 14 章 7–24 节。当耶稣注意到客人怎样拣选首位的时候，就对他们讲了一个比喻。当你被人请去赴婚宴的时候，不要坐在首位上，恐怕有比你尊贵的人也被请了来。那请你和他的人就会过来，对你说：“请让座给这位吧。”这样你就要羞羞愧愧地退到末位上去了。

你被请的时候，倒要去坐在末位上，好叫那请你的人来对你说：“朋友，请上坐。”那时你在同席的人面前就有光彩了。因为凡自高的必降为卑，自卑的必升为高。耶稣又对请他的那人说：“你摆设午饭或晚宴的时候，不要只请你的朋友、弟兄、亲属，或富足的邻舍，恐怕他们也请你回去，作为报答。”

“你摆设筵席的时候，倒要请那贫穷的、残废的、瘸腿的、瞎眼的，你就有福了。因为他们没有什么可报答你，将来义人复活的时候，你必得着报答。”同席的人中有一个听见这话，就对耶稣说：“在神国里吃饭的人有福了！”耶稣说：“有一个人摆设大筵席，请了许多客人。到了坐席的时候，他打发仆人去对所请的人说：‘请来吧，现在一切都预备好了。’

众人一口同辞推托。头一个说：‘我刚买了一块地，必须去看看，请你准我辞了。’另一个说：‘我刚买了五对牛，要去试一试，请你准我辞了。’还有一个说：‘我才娶了妻，所以不能去。’那仆人回来，把这些事都告诉了主人。家主就动怒，对仆人说：‘快出去，到城里的大街小巷，把贫穷的、残废的、瞎眼的、瘸腿的都领来。’仆人说：‘主啊，你所吩咐的已经办了，还有空座。’

主人对仆人说：‘你出去到路上和篱笆那里，勉强人进来，使我的屋子坐满。’我告诉你们，先前所请的人，没有一个得尝我的宴席。这是主的话。”

我们这六月在讲一个短系列，主题是：基督徒应当怎样看待自己的金钱和财物。我们是从路加的记载来看的。本月我们要看的三段经文出自路加福音，还有一段在下周出自使徒行传——那卷书也是路加写的——因为路加在这个主题上有非常多的教导。我们之所以把六月拿出来谈钱，是因为，当一个牧师向会众谈论金钱的时候，教会里往往同时在进行某种“活动”：可能是年度预算到年底了，或者有特别奉献在进行。

当你一谈钱，就说：“你看，你需要奉献给这个事工、那个项目”，听众很自然就会把注意力放在“这个”、“那个”具体的事业和项目上，而不是退一步来问：“好，神究竟要我如何整体地看待金钱？我对钱的态度该是什么？我要如何平衡奉献和花费？我该在自己身上花多少，又该奉献多少呢？”

这就是我们六月要讨论的，因为圣经关于金钱的话题实在太多了。所以，首先，其实我这篇讲道只有两个重点，不是三个，真的只有两个。所以你也别指望因此就能早点散会，但总之只有两个。第一个重点是：在这一章中间，耶稣基督为牺牲式的奉献立下了一个极其惊人的标准。真是惊人，惊人到我们会觉得不太合理。然后第二个重点是：我要给你看，耶稣如何说明这样的奉献其实是完全合理的——因为福音本身有它的逻辑。

所以第一，耶稣在这里为他的百姓、他的门徒，在奉献上立了一个惊人的标准；第二，他怎样用福音的逻辑来解释、来支持这个标准。我们先来看中间这一段耶稣所说的惊人标准。经文说：“耶稣又对请他的主人说。”那么，这位主人是谁呢？耶稣被请到一位颇有显赫地位的人家里。这一点虽然没写在我们刚读的段落里，但在本章一开头就交代了。

耶稣被请去吃一顿大筵席，在一位显赫人的家中，许多客人同席。你看第 7 节说：“耶稣见所请的客拣择首位，就用比喻对他们说。”这是当时典型的筵席场景：大家都想坐得离主人越近越好。然后，耶稣就对主人说：“你摆设午饭或晚宴的时候，不要请你的朋友、弟兄、亲属和富足的邻舍。”而这些人正是那一席上的人。

要明白这段话在讲什么，我们得先补一点背景。整个希腊罗马世界基本上是靠“庇护—门客制度”（patronage system）运转的。这一点对我们并不完全陌生，因为今天世界上还有不少地方存在类似的制度。当时的庇护制度大致是这样的：在每一个社区里，总有一些地位显赫、极其富有的人。如果你想改善自己的处境，想往上爬，就必须设法让其中某一个人成为你的“庇护人”。一旦那人成为你的庇护人，他就会借钱给你、送礼物给你、为你开门铺路。与此同时，你就成了他关系网络中的一分子。

庇护人身边聚集着一圈“受宠者”（favorites）。所谓“受宠者”，就是常常接受庇护人恩惠的人。而庇护人与受宠者所组成的关系网络，在一个社区里可以促成许多事情，因为你有一大群欠你人情的人。你总能在各种事务上得到方便，许多事都会给你“开绿灯”。庇护人能在社区里促成不少事情，因为他的“受宠者”会替他润滑关系、搞政治上的运作之类。

那么，这样的筵席到底在做什么呢？在筵席上，人们彼此认识、互相结交。你要么是为了巩固自己的社会位置——庇护人和受宠者聚在一起，维护他们的关系；要么你就是在努力结交新的关系：要认识新的庇护人，要往上爬。因此，谁会来参加这样的筵席？当然是非常重要的人。你必须请得起那些富足的邻舍，至少要请与你同一社会阶层的人，或者更高阶层的人。

因此，这些筵席一点都不只是简单的“派对”，它们极其重要，而且也极其昂贵。不过，这没关系，因为透过这些宴席，你可以巩固已有的合作关系，达成新的交易，把人纳入你的网络。结果是，这些宴席“稳赚不赔”。它们固然昂贵，却总是能“回本”。既好玩，又奢华，又昂贵，但对你而言也非常划算——这就是整个制度。

耶稣基督来到这位“庇护人”面前，对他说了一句惊人的话：“你摆设午饭或晚宴的时候，不要请你的朋友、弟兄、亲属和富足的邻舍。”也就是说，不要只请眼前这些人。“若请了他们，他们也会请你，作为报答。”当然了，这正是庇护制度的运作方式。接着他又说：“但我要你这样——这是我对门徒的要求：你摆设筵席的时候，要请那贫穷的、残废的、瘸腿的、瞎眼的，你就有福了。”

那么，我们先弄清楚他究竟在说什么，再来看这话意味着什么。首先，他到底在说什么？乍一读，你和我会以为他是在说：永远不要请朋友来家里吃饭。好，那我们现在就可以结束讲道，来祷告了。耶稣说：“不要请你的朋友、弟兄、亲属来吃饭”，经文不就是这样写的吗？“你摆设午饭或晚宴的时候，不要请你的朋友、弟兄、亲属。”要请穷人。这是什么意思呢？

你必须理解希伯来语世界里的语用成语（Semitic idioms）。成语大家都知道，每一种语言都有成语；一种语言里的成语，对那种语言的人来说很自然，但当你把它直译到另一种语言里，如果那种语言里没有这种用法，这句话就会变得非常古怪，因为你把它当成字面意思来看了。

如果你把这段话照字面读，就很难理解。但如果你看本章稍后的一个例子——同样的语用用法——就会清楚一些。在第 26 节，耶稣说：“人到我这里来，若不恨自己的父母，就不能作我的门徒。”这是同一个成语：“恨父母，来跟从我。”你会说：“哦，真的是这样吗？难道这意思就是：你们记得那十条诫命里，有一条说要孝敬父母吗？把那条忘了吧。”耶稣是在说这个吗？难道他的意思是：把那条诫命抛到脑后？当然不是。

那他在说什么？这就是一个成语。字面上虽然说“恨自己的父母，来跟从我”，真正的意思却不是：你不应该爱你的父母，也不是说你爱父母爱得太多，不能这样爱。耶稣的意思只是：你必须更加爱我，远远超过对父母的爱。你要爱我到一个地步，使你对我的爱，显得远远大过你对父母的爱，以至于你爱父母的样子，与爱我相比，好像“恨”一样。换句话说，当这个成语说：“不要爱父母，要爱我”的时候，它真正的意思是：你应当更深地爱我，而不是说你不该爱父母。

同样，当这段话说：“你摆设筵席，不要请朋友”的时候，它并不是说：不要做那些维持你生活地位所需的事；不要娱乐；不要休闲；不要去餐馆吃饭；不要买漂亮的衣服，以保持你在社会上的位置。所有这些，对我们今天来说，就相当于当年的那些筵席——那就是他们的“社交娱乐”。耶稣的意思不是说：完全不要这些。他是在说：你在施舍和事工上的奉献——也就是借着事工把属灵生命带给人，借着慈善把物质生命带给人（饿了就喂他）——你在事工和慈善上的奉献，应该远远超过你在娱乐、休闲、漂亮衣服、度假等方面的花费。这些就是当年筵席所代表的东西。他们没有我们今天这样的度假，那就是他们的“节庆娱乐”。

耶稣的意思不是说：你从来不能花钱在自己身上；而是说：你给在事工和慈善上的钱，应该远远多于你花在自己享受上的钱。那这样的要求到底意味着什么？这就是他在说的。接下来要问的是：这话又意味着什么呢？它的含义是：你在事工和慈善上的奉献必须有优先顺序，而且必须是牺牲式的。

“他的主人是谁呢？耶稣受邀到一位很有名望的人家里做客。我们刚读的经文没有提到这一点，但在本章一开头就写明了。

耶稣被请去参加一场在显赫人家里举办的大筵席，许多客人同席。你看第 7 节说：他见所请的客拣择首位——也就是说，这是一个典型的筵席场景，人们都在想方设法坐得离主人越近越好。于是耶稣对主人说：‘你摆设午饭或晚宴的时候，不要请你的朋友、弟兄、亲属，或富足的邻舍。’而这些人正是坐在那里的客人。

要明白这里发生了什么，我们得先稍微讲一点背景。希腊—罗马世界是靠“庇护—门客制度”运转的。这个制度对我们今天的人也不完全陌生，因为世界上还有不少地方类似。制度大致是这样的：在每一个社区里，都有一些显赫而富有的人物。如果你想改善自己的处境，想往上爬，就必须让其中某一个人成为你的“庇护人”。一旦他成了你的庇护人，他就会借钱给你、送礼给你、为你开门铺路。而你也就成了他关系网络中的一分子。

庇护人身边有一群“受宠者”。所谓“受宠者”，就是那些常常从庇护人那里得恩惠的人。庇护人与受宠者组成的这个网络，使得庇护人能够在社区里办成很多事，因为他有一大群欠他人情的人。于是，你总能在各种事情上得到方便，各样事也都能顺利成就。庇护人可以在社区里成就很多事，因为这些“受宠者”会替他把路打通，搞政治上的运作等等。

当你看到这些筵席时，背后就是这种运作模式。筵席上，人们彼此认识、互相结交。你要么是在巩固自己现有的社会地位——庇护人和受宠者聚在一起，维系他们的关系网络；要么就是在努力结交新的关系：你想认识新的庇护人，想往上爬。

因此，能参加筵席的人就非常关键了。你必须请得起那些富足的邻舍，必须请至少与你同阶层，甚至更高阶层的人。

正因为如此，这些聚会绝不仅仅是普通的“派对”。它们极其重要，也极其昂贵。不过，这没关系。因为透过这些宴席，你能巩固已有合作关系，达成新的交易，把人纳入你的关系网络。所以，这样的宴席“稳赚不赔”。虽然花费巨大，却总是“回本”的。既奢华，又热闹，又昂贵，却也对你非常有利——这就是整个制度。

耶稣基督来到这位“庇护人”面前，却大胆地对他说：“你摆设午饭或晚宴的时候，不要请你的朋友、弟兄、亲属，或富足的邻舍”，也就是眼前这些人。“若请了他们，他们也会请你，作为报答。”当然了，这正是庇护制度的运作方式。

但耶稣接着说：“不过，我要你这样做——这是我对门徒的要求：你摆设筵席的时候，要请那贫穷的、残废的、瘸腿的、瞎眼的，你就有福了。”那么，先要弄清楚他究竟在说什么，然后再来看这话意味着什么。首先，他到底在说什么呢？乍一读，你我会以为，他是在说：你永远不要请朋友来家里吃饭。好，我们现在就可以结束讲道了，一起祷告吧。耶稣说：“不要请你的朋友、弟兄、亲属来吃饭”，经文不就是这么写的吗？“你摆设午饭或晚宴的时候，不要请你的朋友、弟兄、亲属。”要请穷人。这到底什么意思？

你必须明白“闪族语境中的成语用法”（Semitic idioms）。成语大家都熟悉，每一种语言都有自己的成语表达。一种语言里的成语，对母语者非常自然，但当你把它直译到另一种语言里，如果那种语言里没有这个用法，直译出来就会很奇怪，因为你把它当字面意思来理解了。

如果你把这句话照字面来读，就会觉得不太合理。但如果你看本章稍后的一个例子——同样的成语用法——就会明白一些。在第 26 节，耶稣说：“人到我这里来，若不恨自己的父母，就不能作我的门徒。”这就是同一个成语：“恨父母，来跟从我。”你会说：“哦，真的是这样吗？难道这就是：你们记得那十条诫命里，有一条说要孝敬父母吗？把那条忘了吧。”耶稣是在说这个吗？他是在说，那条要抛到脑后？当然不是。

那他究竟在说什么呢？这就是一个成语。虽然字面上说“恨自己的父母，来跟从我”，但真正的意思并不是：你不应该爱你的父母，也不是说你爱父母爱得太多了，不能这么爱。耶稣的意思只是：你必须更加爱我，远远超过对父母的爱。你要爱我到一个地步，使你对我的爱大过你对父母的爱，以至于你对父母的爱与对我的爱相比，好像“恨”一样。

换句话说，当这成语说：“不要爱父母，要爱我”的时候，真正的意思是：你应当更深地爱我，而不是说你不该爱父母。同样，当这段话说：“你摆设筵席，不要请朋友”的时候，它并不是在说：不要做那些维持你社会地位所需的事；不要娱乐；不要休闲；不要出门吃饭；不要买漂亮衣服来维持你的社会地位。这些事情，对我们今天来说，就对应着当年那些筵席——那就是他们的“社交娱乐”。

耶稣的意思不是说：完全不要这些。他是在说：你在施舍和事工上的奉献——借着事工把属灵生命带给人，使人得着信心；借着慈善使贫穷人得着肉身的生命，因为他们饥饿的时候得到喂养——你在事工和慈善上的奉献，应该远远超过你花在娱乐、休闲、漂亮衣服、度假等方面的钱。这些，就是当年筵席所代表的东西。他们没有我们今天的“度假”，这种筵席就是他们的“节庆娱乐”。

所以，他并不是在说：你永远不能花钱在自己身上；而是在说：你为事工和慈善所花的钱，应当远远多过你花在自身享受上的钱。那这究竟意味着什么呢？这就是他在说的。那这话又带来什么含义？含义是：你在事工和慈善上的奉献必须有优先次序，而且必须是牺牲式的。

所以，你在事工和慈善上的奉献，必须具有优先性，而且必须是牺牲的。好好想一想。

顺带一提，我其实直到最近几周预备这篇讲道的时候，才真正开始理解这段经文的含义。首先，他在谈的是“优先次序”。当他说，“恨父母，爱我”的时候，他并不是在说你不该爱父母，而是在说：你必须更爱我，我才是优先。如果你不得不在我和父母之间二选一，你必须选择我——他不就是这个意思吗？耶稣不就是这么说的吗？当然是。

那么，他在这里说的也是同样的事。他其实是在说：你的奉献必须被视作“刚需”；你给事工和慈善的，是“刚性支出”；反而花在自己身上的钱，才应该是“可选项”，才是可以协商的。要把二者对调。现在，对我们多数人来说，是这样的：我们有一些财务目标，有一些生活方式上的目标。有一些我们想过的生活：想去某些地方度假，想买某些衣服，想做某些事情。如果我们有足够的钱，既能实现这些生活，又能给一点钱做事工和慈善，那我们就会去做。但在这样的模式里，奉献是“可选项”，而花在自己身上的钱才是“优先项”，才是“刚需”。

耶稣却说：把它们调过来。有些年前，有一位英国农夫养了不少牲畜。他的一头母牛怀孕了，他非常高兴。因为他农场上的牲畜数量，其实已经足够满足他自己的需要了，日常所需都能供应。

因此，当这头牛生下小牛并养大之后，他可以把那头小牛卖掉，挣一笔可观的收入。让他更加高兴的是，那头牛竟然生了两头小牛，是双胞胎。这意味着，将来小牛养大卖掉时，他能挣双倍的收入，他非常兴奋。于是他走进屋里，有点慷慨激昂地对妻子说：你知道吗，亲爱的，我们是基督徒，也在教会聚会，你看，将来这两头小牛长大卖掉之后，我要把卖价的一半献给主。一半的钱要奉献给教会。

“我把卖两头牛所得的总价算一算，假设是某个金额，其中一头牛卖的钱，我们全给主，其余的归自己。”他妻子说：“太好了，真属灵。”

过了几个星期，这个丈夫脸色沉重地走进屋来。妻子问他：“怎么了？”他说：“唉，主的那头牛死了。小牛得了病，两头都病了，一头慢慢好起来了，另一头没好过来，死了。”妻子说：“有意思，我都不记得我们曾经正式决定哪一头是‘主的牛’呢？”丈夫说：“哦，不，用不了正式决定，从一开始我心里就想：那一头是主的牛。偏偏就是那一头死了，真可惜。”

这个故事的重点是什么？重点是：死的永远是“主的那一头牛”。换句话说，总有一些衣服是我们想买的，总有一些度假是我们想去的，总有一些旅行计划、某种居住方式是我们想要的。这些东西占了优先。如果手里还有余钱，我们就给一点给事工、给慈善；一旦经济有压力，拮据了，我们就从那里“挤”，先从奉献里“抠”，从事工和慈善里减。耶稣却说：我要你把这两者换过来。我希望你从你自己身上“抠”，从你自己的肉里“割”。

这意味着，这段经文的含义不仅在于：你的奉献必须有优先顺序；还在于：你的奉献必须是牺牲式的。这段经文与圣经中其他关于奉献的经文息息相关。

在旧约，对信徒奉献的标准很清楚：十分之一，也就是十一奉献。经文很直接地说：把你收入的十分之一给利未人、给会幕、给穷人，给事工和慈善。然而，当你来到新约的时候，只有一处经文是耶稣亲口肯定十一奉献的，就是路加福音 11 章 42–43 节。他在那里谈到法利赛人怎样献十一，说：“这些原是你们当行的。”所以，耶稣并不反对十一奉献。

然而，新约其他地方几乎不再提到十一奉献。取而代之的是这样的教导：比如哥林多后书第 8 章，保罗在那里劝哥林多教会为耶路撒冷的穷人捐款。他提到马其顿的教会已经先行奉献。他在第 3 节说：“他们是按着力量，而且也过了力量。”这是什么意思呢？你和我常常说：“我很想奉献更多，但我负担不起。”其实我们真正的意思是：“我负担不起在没有牺牲的前提下多给。”但关键就在这里。

我相信，在旧约里，“十分之一”是一个标准，是信徒奉献的起码尺度。耶稣会说，那是一个很好的起点。但新约整体要表达的是：你如何知道自己奉献得够多了？答案是：必须到一个“会痛”的地步。也就是说，你必须因此做出某些牺牲。你必须因为奉献，而有一些不能做的事情；有一些地方你不能去；有一些消费你不能享受——因为你在给出去。你给得多到一个地步，它对你是“有刺痛感”的。这才是真正的标准。

这就是耶稣在这里讲的。你可以想像，他对一个“庇护人”说这话，有多么惊人：“我不希望你摆筵席，只请你的富足邻舍和朋友；我要你去请穷人。”你要明白，如果你照传统方式，给与你同阶层的人办筵席，在那个场合里，庇护关系运作、资源交换，那固然要花很多钱，但算得上是一种投资，是会“回本”的。那就是做生意的方式，是维持你商业关系的一种手段。

所以，你照常办一场宴席，就像耶稣所说的那样，有一种用钱的方式，是能够“回收成本”的，“他们也会请你，作为报答”。但如果你真的摆一桌筵席去请穷人、残废的、瘸腿的、瞎眼的，那就是把钱一股脑儿“扔出去”，一点都收不回来。

换句话说，耶稣在说的是：有一种用钱方式不是牺牲式的，有一种用钱方式是牺牲式的，而他要的，就是后者——牺牲。

那么，这听起来是不是不合理？这确实会让人震惊。就我自己而言，这也让我不得不审视自己；我也在和这段经文搏斗。我绝不是站在这里说：“看，我都做到了，你们也应该做到。”不，我和你们一样，都需要站在这段经文底下，让它来审判我们。

这段经文很少被当成“财务管家”的经文来讲，但这些年我越来越看见，它究竟在说什么。

十八世纪那位写《奇异恩典》的英国圣公会牧师约翰·牛顿（John Newton），就对这段经文感到很不安。他大致是这样说的：无论我怎么读这段经文，无论我怎么试图“缓和”耶稣的话，我都知道，耶稣肯定不是在说：“你永远不能见你的朋友”这类过头的话。但不管我怎样读，结论总是一样：我应当比现在给出更多的钱。

好，那么这一切是不是不合理呢？如果你真正明白福音，就不会觉得不合理。接下来我要指出三件事：在这整段经文中，耶稣如何借着福音的逻辑，让你看见：这样的用钱方式，其实是非常合理的。

这段经文很长，其中有三段“讲话”。一开始，他对所有客人说话（第 8–11 节）；中间，他对主人说话（第 12–14 节）；最后，他对一个自鸣得意的客人说话，讲了“大神筵”的比喻（第 15 节以后）。在每一段讲话的结尾，他都指出：福音如何帮助我们看见，牺牲式的奉献其实很合理。

第一段，我们已经读过，就是第 7–11 节。第 7 节说，耶稣见所请的客拣择首位，于是就说了这样一个比喻：你被人请去赴婚宴，不要去坐在高位上，免得有人来叫你“请让座给这位吧”，你就当众蒙羞；要坐在末位，好叫主人来对你说：“朋友，请上坐。”

从一个层面看，这不过是一点生活智慧。耶稣似乎是在说：不要做那种总在自我吹嘘的人。如果你总宣传自己，人们会讨厌你。结果很讽刺：那些最善于自我推销、最爱表现自己的人，往往并不会真的被提拔，因为大家都厌烦他们。所以，耶稣是在说：要谦卑，让你的生命品质自己说话，让别人来称赞你，这比你自己吹自己强太多了。箴言 26–27 章里有很多类似的教导。

多年来，我渐渐明白这段经文的意思。写出《奇异恩典》等赞美诗的十八世纪圣公会牧师约翰·牛顿，就对这段经文深感困扰。他说，大致是这样：“无论我怎样拆解这段经文，无论我怎么解读，我都知道，耶稣不可能是字面意义上在说‘你永远不要见朋友、不要和任何人来往’。但无论我怎么读，有一点始终没变：这段经文意味着，我应该比现在给出更多的钱。”

那么，这是不是不合理呢？如果你真正明白福音，就不会觉得不合理。接下来，我要指出三件事：耶稣如何借着福音，帮助你看见，这样使用你的钱，其实极其合理。

这段经文很长，其中包含三段“讲话”。一开始，他对所有客人说话（8–11 节）；中间，他对主人说话（12–14 节）；最后，他对一个自鸣得意的客人说话，讲了“大神筵”的比喻。在这三段讲话的结尾，耶稣都指出：福音如何帮助我们明白，牺牲式的奉献是很合理的。

这是第一点，在第 7–11 节，我们已经读过。耶稣看见客人怎样拣选首位，然后说：“你被人请去赴筵席，就不要去坐在高位上，免得有人来对你说：‘请让座给这位吧’，你就当众蒙羞；要坐在末位，好叫人对你说：‘朋友，请上坐。’”

从某个层面看，这不过是一条很实在的人生建议。他其实是在说：不要做那种总在吹嘘自己的人。如果你总吹嘘自己，人们自然不会喜欢你。讽刺的是，那些最会推销自己、处处高举自己的人，结果常常并不会真的被提拔，因为周围的人都厌烦他们。所以，耶稣是在说：要谦卑，让你的生命品质自己说话，让别人来称赞你，这比你自己夸耀自己要好得多。箴言 26–27 章中也有许多类似的教导。

但耶稣不只是说这些。他不只是讲一点处世之道，因为到了第 11 节，他把这个原则提升到一个“属灵现实核心”的层面。他说：“因为凡自高的必降为卑，自卑的必升为高。”这里的“凡”（everyone），说明他讲的不只是“有时候不要自吹自擂比较聪明”而已。第 11 节，他在谈的是宇宙性的规律。他说：“凡自高的必降为卑，自卑的必升为高。”

我其实一点也不介意用整篇讲道，只讲这一节经文。因为耶稣在这里所说的，在生命的每一个领域都成立；而在属灵生命的核心，它尤其真实。这是什么意思呢？这意味着，如果你来到神面前说：“我配得被接纳”，你就会被拒绝——因为这显明你根本不了解自己心里有什么。但如果你来到神面前说：“我配得被拒绝，求你赦免我”，你反而会被接纳。这就是福音。

宗教会说：你要到神面前说：“我配得被接纳，看我做了多少好事。”但福音说：如果你说“我配得被接纳”，你就会被拒绝；如果你说“我配得被拒绝”——也就是你在神面前甘愿坐在末位——神就会接纳你、把你升高。因为福音的原则是：“自卑的必升为高，自高的必降为卑。”

如果你自高自大，你就会被降为卑——因为那是“靠行为得救”的路；如果你谦卑自己，你就会被升高——因为那是“靠恩典得救”。

注意这里的“升高”这个词。神把人“升高”，到底是什么意思？雅各书 4:10 和彼得前书 5:6 都说：“务要在主大能的手下自卑，到了时候，他必叫你们升高。”也就是说，神要举起你，抬举你。耶稣在约翰福音 12:43 对法利赛人说：“你们爱人的荣耀过于爱神的荣耀。”就是这个意思：如果你心里有神的荣耀——如果你已经悔改，在神面前坐在“末位”，而他亲自把你举起来、接纳你、白白称你为义——你的心就会被神的荣耀充满，被他喜悦你的心意所充满，被他的爱所充满。

这意味着什么呢？这意味着，你里面有了一种新的属灵“内在财富”，有了真正的财富、真正的价值感、真正的安全感。于是，你就不会再用同样的眼光看你的外在财富了。因为，如果生命的中心没有神，没有神的荣耀在你心里，钱就不只是钱。钱会变成你的安全感，变成你的自我价值。你会说：“我有钱，所以知道自己有分量；我有钱，所以知道自己安全。”

如果你的生命中心没有神，如果你的内心不是被神的荣耀充满，你就会像那些抢着坐首位的人一样，总是在向上爬，总在拼命结交比你稍微“更好一点”的人，总是想要更多的钱、更多的安全感、更多的繁荣、更多的地位。但耶稣说，他的门徒在生命中心有神的荣耀，他们已经被神升高，因此他们不必再“往上挤”。

你会发现，8–10 节的教导非常平衡。耶稣实际上是在说：“我不希望我的人、我的门徒，把‘往上爬、被接纳进核心圈子’当成生命的激情所在。那不该驱动你的人生。”但他也不是说，“基督徒不能成功”。不是的。如果有人邀请你进入“内圈”，那很好，他说“可以”。耶稣并不反对基督徒成功，而是说：成功不该成为你生命的终极激情。如果发生了，那很好；如果没有，也没什么，因为你里面已经拥有一种极其丰富的属灵财富。

结果是什么呢？结果就是，你更容易把外在的财富给出去。因为对你来说，外在财富——钱——就只是钱而已，不再是别的东西。

这就是福音的逻辑如何让我们更容易慷慨施予的第一点。但还不止于此。第二点，我们刚才已经读过第二段讲话，却还没看它的结尾。那就是第 12–14 节。耶稣对主人说：“不要请这些人，要请穷人、残废的、瘸腿的、瞎眼的，你就有福了”，然后他说：“因为他们没有什么可报答你，将来义人复活的时候，你必得着报答。”

他在说什么呢？他说，照着耶稣所描述的方式去生活，会有一个问题。那是什么？就是：你必须不断把自己倒空，为别人付出；你要打开生命的门，让人走进来；你要关心受苦的人；你要多走一里路，去作那些别人都不愿意作的人的朋友；你要把非常多的钱给出去；你要大大地参与在事工和慈善里。你知道这意味着什么吗？这意味着，有时候你会觉得自己仿佛“错过了很多”。

你会说：“别人有钱做这个，他们能去那个地方旅行，他们能那样生活；而我错过了。我不会有这种经历，我不会去那样的旅行，我大概永远都没办法活成那样。我错过了。”

耶稣说：“不。”因为有复活。所以你一点都不会错过。因为你的未来，不是那种虚无缥缈、灵魂离体、在空中游荡的状态，并不是成为一种抽象的“意识”。你会有身体。神的国是筵席；将来的神国，是一场筵席。你会有身体。

复活的耶稣基督是有身体的，门徒可以摸到他，他还吃了一块鱼。那意味着什么呢？意味着在将来，你不会错过任何东西。

二十世纪中期那位伟大的英国传道人马丁·劳埃德—琼斯（David Martyn Lloyd-Jones）曾经在哥林多前书 15 章“身体复活”这一段上讲过一篇讲道，那篇讲道深深打动了我，真正扎进了我的心里。我 somewhere 还有那篇讲道的老录音带，也有我当年记的笔记。他在讲道末尾大致是这样说的（以下是意译，也是我笔记里记下的）：

他说，这是哥林多前书 15 章关于身体复活的经文。他说：神的国是一场筵席，你们将要得着新的身体。罗马书 8:11 说，使耶稣从死里复活者的灵若住在你们心里，那使基督耶稣从死里复活的，也必借着住在你们里面的圣灵，使你们必死的身体又活过来。

劳埃德—琼斯接着说（大意）：当你渐渐变老时，你会开始以为“你的敌人就是你的身体”。但事实不是这样：真正的敌人是在你的身体里面，总有一天会被完全驱逐。你将要得着新的身体——复活的身体、得医治的身体。

新英格兰的大牧师乔纳森·爱德华兹曾经说：现在，在我们这个堕落的身体里——这个会犯罪、会生病、会死亡的身体里——我们有五种感官，对吧？五感。但将来，在我们的新身体里，也许会有一百种感官，也许是一千种，甚至是一万种。换句话说，相较于你将来在复活里会是怎样的人，现在的你几乎就像一棵“蔬菜”一样。相比你将来的荣耀状态，你现在不过是一个“植物人”级别的存在。

然后劳埃德—琼斯又说：复活的基督吃了一块鱼。你的将来不会是某种虚无缥缈、抽象的意识形态，你也不会变成一团“非人格化的意识”。你会在神的国里吃饭，你会爱人，也会被爱，你会拥抱别人，也会被拥抱。你会唱歌，会跳舞。你的脚会踩在地上——真正的脚。

你会吃、会唱、会爱、会被爱——而这一切都将在一种如今你完全无法想像的能力、荣耀与满足的境界中发生。我们要在神的国里“行走”，而不是“飘浮在神的国之上”。我们要在神的国里“行军”，要和人子一同吃喝。

你是否害怕，因为你给出太多时间、太多金钱，你会错过某些人生体验？别人有时间、有钱去做某些事情，而你因为奉献和服事，做不了？耶稣说：你不会错过任何东西。为什么？因为有复活。他说：“他们在今世不能报答你”，讲的就是这一点。但因着复活，你终极的报偿是稳固、确定的。这使得你现在给出去，是再合理不过的事。你不会错过任何东西。

最后，再看第三点。所以你看耶稣在说什么：第一，你在福音里得着了一种“新的内在财富”；第二，你在福音里得着了一种“有保障的未来财富”——复活。然而还有第三点：你必须看见，为了让你能进这筵席，耶稣基督付出了什么样的牺牲。

来看这“大神筵”的比喻，这是最后一段故事。事实上，这个比喻本身就可以讲一整篇道，许多人也确实如此。耶稣对筵席上的一个自鸣得意的客人说话，这个客人听见耶稣对主人说的话，就在第 15 节说：“在神国里吃饭的人有福了！”这人显然是那种热衷攀附、拼命往上爬的人，而且他非常确定自己一定会在那里。

耶稣于是说：好，你说神国是一场筵席，是吗？让我告诉你，神的国究竟是什么样子的。他讲了一个比喻，来向这人说明：神国——也就是救恩——是如何运作的。

比喻是这样的：首先，有一位类似“庇护人”的大人物，要摆设一场极大的筵席。这里的“大神筵”一词，在原文中用的是希腊文的“mega”——是一场“mega 盛宴”，极其盛大、极其丰盛，可能有数百人、甚至上千人参加。这个主人发出第一轮邀请：“请来吧，现在一切都预备好了。”

第一批受邀者，是那种通常会被请去参加这种宴席的人，是与主人同一社会阶层的人。但这些人都“很忙”——他们都有“合理的理由”：做买卖、谈生意、结婚等等。理由看起来都很正当，但他们就是不来。于是，这位设宴的主人说：既然如此，那就去请那些从来没有资格参加这种筵席的人吧——那些按常理说不该出现在这里的人。

于是，他先打发仆人去找城里的穷人。经文说，他让仆人出去到“街市和小巷”，把穷人、残废的、瞎眼的、瘸腿的都带进来。可是席上仍有许多空位。接着，他又打发仆人出去——这一次，是到乡间去（经文在 23 节说“路上和篱笆那里”）。

在旧译本里，这被翻作“大道和篱笆”（the highways and the hedges）。到这一层，他是打发仆人去找乡间的穷人——那些住在乡间小路边、睡在篱笆旁的人。那些人往往极其绝望，其中不少是强盗，是危险而又走投无路的人，他们比城里的穷人还要贫困。

注意，对于这些乡间的穷人，主人的吩咐有所不同。他说：“你出去到路上和篱笆那里，勉强人进来，使我的屋子坐满。”这一节经文常常让解经家十分惊讶，因为这里用了一个很强烈的希腊动词。它的意思是：催逼他们、敦促他们、与他们争论、据理说服他们，要把他们“劝进来”，因为他们根本不会轻易相信这是真的。

为什么？因为耶稣基督在这里为我们描绘的神国，是一个“完全预备好的救恩”。你注意到邀请的内容吗？“请来吧，现在一切都预备好了。”这就是救恩的信息：“来吧，一切都已经预备好了。”

你知道这意味着什么吗？如果神的国是一场筵席，那它绝不是“百乐餐”（potluck dinner）。所谓百乐餐，就是每个人都得带一道菜来。耶稣说：绝对不是这样。神的国，是已经完全预备好的筵席；没有任何东西需要你来准备，没有什么菜需要你买、需要你煮。一切都已经预备妥当了。你只需要来，白白领受这完备的救恩。

难怪那些在“大道和篱笆”旁的人不相信这是真的。主人不得不对仆人说：你得出去，不停地和他们解释、辩论、坚持地劝他们进来，否则他们绝不会相信自己真的被邀请参加这样的一场筵席。

我也希望你看见——我相信耶稣也希望你看见——那些在“篱笆外”的人，其实就是你和我。我们天生并不真正相信“恩典的福音”，福音必须一遍遍“被逼进来”。坦白说，我们许多人到今天还住在“篱笆外”。我们仍然会说：“主啊，我知道，只要我活得够好，你就会祝福我。”这句话本身就说明，你还在篱笆外，你还没有真正明白福音的逻辑。

按这样的逻辑，我们永远不可能进去——因为我们确实不配进去。这一点是对的：我们确实不配。第 24 节说：“我告诉你们，先前所请的人，没有一个得尝我的宴席。”

但第 24 节同时也把我们指向耶稣。你看，在筵席外，有一群人——骄傲的人，是那群因骄傲而拒绝邀请的人；而在筵席内，是另一群人——谦卑的人。但是，我们为何仅仅凭着“谦卑”就能进去？为什么我们只要肯承认“主啊，我不配”，就可以坐在完全免费的筵席前？难道是我们的“谦卑”赚来了这顿筵席吗？当然不是。让我们得以进入这筵席的，是耶稣基督在十字架上所做的一切。

在马太福音 25 章里，耶稣讲了两个关于审判日的比喻。在其中一个比喻里，审判日那位主对一群人说：“好，你这又良善又忠心的仆人，可以进来享受你主人的快乐。”在另一个比喻里，那位主对另一群人说：“你们这被咒诅的人，离开我，进入永火里去。”一边是：“好，你这又良善又忠心的仆人，来享受筵席”；另一边是：“离开我，你这被咒诅的，你在我的筵席上没有一份。”

耶稣是那唯一一位用全心、全性、全意、全力爱神，又爱邻舍如同自己的人，他过的是一生完全无瑕的生活。在生命的尽头，他理当听见父神对他说：“好，你这又良善又忠心的仆人，可以进来享受你主人的快乐。”但我们知道，他在十字架上听见的不是这句话。

为什么耶稣在十字架上呼喊：“我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？”因为在那一刻，他在灵魂深处听见的是那句审判日的话：“你这被咒诅的人，离开我，进入永火里去。”他被赶出去了，他被丢弃了——那正是我们应得的——使我们得以被带进来。

他听见的是：“你这被咒诅的人，离开我，进入永火里去”，好叫我们只要悔改，只要承认“我不配”，就能听见那句：“好，你这又良善又忠心的仆人，可以进来享受你主人的快乐。”为什么？因为让我们得以进筵席的，不是我们的谦卑，而是耶稣基督所做的一切。

他被赶出筵席，使我们得以被带进来。他为我们被丢弃。他本来富足，却为我们成了贫穷；他本是“内部人”，却为我们成了“外人”；他原本站在最高的座位，却被赶出筵席，使我们这些本来在外面的人得以被带进来。

而这，正是福音逻辑中帮助我们看待奉献的最后一块拼图。当你意识到：耶稣基督为了给你生命而牺牲自己，你自然就会开始问：“那我又怎能不牺牲，使别人得生命呢？”

你是靠基督的牺牲而活的，是因为他的牺牲，你才有生命。现在，就用你的牺牲——不是流血的牺牲，而是金钱上的牺牲——去使别人活：借着奉献给事工，使人得着属灵的生命；借着奉献给慈善，使饥饿的人得着肉身的生命。

你越看见自己是靠基督的牺牲而活，你就越觉得：牺牲式的奉献，是再合理不过的事。因为我们在福音里得着了内在的财富，也得着了将来必得的财富——复活的盼望。

那位本来富足的，为我们成了贫穷；那位本来是“内部人”的，为我们成了“外人”；那位本来坐在最高座位上的，被赶出筵席，使你我得以被领进来。因此，牺牲式的奉献不只是一个“高难度的属灵标准”，更是合情合理的回应。

让我们作为一个群体，一起来与这段经文搏斗吧。你们当中有些人今天只是来访的客人，甚至根本不住在这座城市，很明显，我并不是在向你要钱。有些人根本不是本教会的会友。还有一点我要说明——下周我们会更多谈这个——我今天也不是在说：“所以，你的应用就是：把钱奉献给 Redeemer 教会。”

首先，你们当中很多人并不属于 Redeemer，也不是这里的会友。我不希望你心里想：“哦，又有一个牧师在向我要钱。”我真正希望你问的，是这样一个问题：“在福音的光照之下，我应该以什么样的态度看待我的金钱？”这是一个让人有些害怕的问题。正如约翰·牛顿所说：“我其实不知道该如何完全弄懂耶稣在这里说的每一句话，但我只知道一件事：我需要比现在给出更多。”

我们一起祷告。父啊，求你帮助我们效法你儿子的形象：他本来富足，却为我们成了贫穷；他本是内部人，却被赶到门外。当我们看见这一点时，它必定要影响我们看待钱财、生活方式和消费选择的方式。

求你使我们这个群体，在彼此之间、在这座城市里，都因慷慨而闻名。求你使我们越来越效法那位“来不是要受人的服侍，乃是要服侍人，并且舍命作多人的赎价”的儿子。奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。
