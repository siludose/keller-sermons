## English Transcript / 英文原文

Today Tim Keller is exploring how the Spirit calls us to faith, unites us together, equips  us with gifts, and shapes us to be more like Christ. Our scripture reading this morning is from Ephesians 4 verses 7 through 16. But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it. This is why it says, when he ascended on high, he led captives in his train and gave  gifts to men. What does he ascended mean, except that he also descended to the lower earthly regions?

He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens in order to fill  the whole universe. It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and  some to be pastors and teachers to prepare God's people for works of service, so that the  body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge  of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. Then we will no longer be infants tossed back and forth by the waves and blown here and  there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful  scheming. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the  head that is Christ. From him, the whole body joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds  itself up in love as each part does its work.

This is the word of the Lord. Now in our series on the Holy Spirit, we come to the subject of what the Bible calls  the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and you know, coming up on a good 40 years really in Christian  ministry, I know you wouldn't know that to look at me, but coming up on 40 years, I've  seen the pendulum in the church swing to such extreme places over the subject of spiritual  gifts. From obsessive focus on them to ignoring them, and I think we are going to see that  there is nothing more practical for helping us understand what a Christian church would  actually look like concretely on the ground than to embrace what the Bible gives us here  – a theology of spiritual gifts. So if we can avoid the extremes, we are going to learn a lot about what we should look  like. If this is your church, what this church should look like, if you come from some other  church, what your church there should look like.

Let's ask three questions of the text. What are spiritual gifts? Then what are the practical implications of the theology of spiritual gifts? What are the implications for church life? And thirdly, how can we rightly use spiritual gifts?

First, what are they? Let me give you a definition drawn from years of thinking about what the Bible says about  it. The definition is spiritual gifts are differing abilities given by a Holy Spirit to each  believer to meet needs in such a way that it creates a community of people who are growing  into the fullness of the character of Jesus Christ. Let me break that down into three parts for you. First of all, spiritual gifts are abilities to meet needs.

There are five lists of spiritual gifts in the Bible. There's actually one in Romans 12, there's two in 1 Corinthians 12, there's this  one here in Ephesians 4, there's one in 1 Peter 4, and every one of the lists is really  quite different. And it's pretty clear that each one is not exhaustive, it's illustrative, and even if you  put them all together, we don't have all the gifts listed. But if you read them all, you'll see there are clusters of gifts. Some gifts are the ability to communicate truth like evangelism, teaching.

Some gifts are the ability to bear burdens, so you have gifts of encouragement and of mercy  and of service and of helps of assistance. And some gifts are gifts to give direction, so you have leadership and administration  and wisdom which is a counseling gift, a way of giving an individual direction. But now look, there is no human need, spiritual, physical, psychological, relational that doesn't  have some spiritual gift that can address it. Spiritual gifts are the ability to address those kinds of needs. See, some spiritual gifts heal us when we're wounded or some spiritual gifts encourage  us where we're downcast.

Some spiritual gifts challenge us when we're lagging or correct us when we're going astray  or love us when we're being rejected or just inform us where we're ignorant. There is no human need that doesn't have some spiritual gift that can address it. So spiritual gifts are the abilities to address needs. Secondly, these spiritual gifts are different and yet given to every believer. See, it says, to each Christ has given a portion of the Spirit's power to meet needs.

In spite of the fact that we're all one, fundamentally in Christ, spiritual gifts create enormous  diversity, not only as we're going to see this as we go along. Not only do spiritual gifts make Christians differ a lot from person to person in what  they see and what they resonate to and how they look at the world and not only are individual  Christians incredibly different, but gifts make churches different from each other. Churches are very different from other churches because the gift mixes that are in those  churches can be very, very different than the gift mix of a church right across the street. And as a result, it's one of the reasons why you have this amazing diversity in the Christian  church. It's really one of the reasons why people are saying, why isn't the Christian church more?

Why is it so different? Why is there so many denominations? So many churches. Why? Why?

One of the reasons is this. Another reason is sin. One of the reasons is this. One of the reasons is this, but even though it makes it different, every believer, it does  not say to some believers, to super-believers, to certain believers, you get spiritual gifts  everyone. When it says to each one of us who's us Christians, Paul's not just saying us ministers  or something like that, to each.

So everybody gets a portion. Jesus has all the ministerial abilities to communicate truth, to bear burdens, to give  direction. He has all. We get a portion of his ministry ability to meet needs, but everyone gets one, and only  a portion. Now, thirdly, and this is actually the most important thing I'm going to press two or  three times here today.

What is the goal of spiritual gifts? What is the goal of ministry? Paul's sentences are very long, and they're even longer than they appear in the English,  because in English translators usually break his sentences into several sentences to make  a little bit clearer. Sometimes it's not that easy to tell what is the final goal of all this. You have everybody's getting a gift, and then you've got some of these more prominent  gifts like pastor's teachers, evangelist, prophets, and then to do what?

To equip people from the work of service, so everybody's doing their job, but what is  the ultimate goal? To build up the body until we reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son  of God and become mature attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. Now, that's a mouthful, but here's the purpose of all ministry. Ministry in the church, exercising a spiritual gift is not there just to make people happy  in some general way. First of all, it's to form us into a body.

Spiritual gifts make us a body. So I often have loved to say, there's a difference between an aggregation and a congregation. An aggregation is like a bag of marbles. There they are, a thousand marbles in a bag, and they're all next to each other, but  they're slipping and sliding, and they're not in any particular pattern. They have no particular relationship with each other, they're all in the same bag.

And there are churches that are aggregations, but a congregation is a body because every  gift makes you to differ from the other gifts, and yet your gift is absolutely necessary  in the church. And therefore, the Holy Spirit makes us a body, so you have your head and your hands and  your feet and your elbows, that's the image, but it means that everyone is not only different  unlike the marbles, but we are all intimately related to each other. So the Holy Spirit, especially spiritual gifts, make us a body, but the whole purpose of  all this ministry is to create Christ's likeness in one another. You don't just encourage in general, you don't just teach in general, you don't just help  in general. When spiritual gifts are exercised rightly, the result in the recipient of the ministry  is growing Christ's likeness, growing into the likeness of Jesus.

You know what that is? H.A. Cadbury was a professor of theology and Bible, Harvard from the 1930s, the 1950s,  and he loved getting undergraduate students who had never read the Bible, which of course  was quite a lot, even then. And he loved having, they'd all heard of Jesus, but just to have them read about Jesus, read  the accounts of what he was like, what he said, what he did, and just get what he called  their virgin reaction. And they're always shocked.

One of his students wrote this, you read about Jesus, who is he? What is he? Despite being absolutely approachable. This student wrote, Jesus, despite being absolutely approachable to the weakest and most broken  people, he is completely fearless before the proud and the corrupt. Despite being profoundly human and becoming weary and lonely and moved to joy and love  and anger, we never see him moody.

We never see him inconsistent. He is tender without being weak, strong without being harsh, humble without the slightest  lack of confidence. He has conviction without intolerance, enthusiasm without fanaticism, holiness without  Phariseism, passion without prejudice. This man alone never made a false step, never struck a jarring note. This is life at its highest.

And that is what spiritual gifts are supposed to produce. That's the point. When spiritual gifts are being used in the congregation, that's what results in the  lives of the people. And that is why, just the last thing I want to say about what spiritual gifts are, the  essence of a spiritual gift is the blessing of God, not the form of the action. And here's what I mean by that.

We live, I'll get back to those two. We live in New York City where what really matters is, I don't care about your accent,  they tell you here, I don't care where you're from, I don't even care how you address  what you look like, can you produce? Are you good enough? And so there's enormous emphasis on being talented and being gifted and being able to do  things. And what we have to recognize here is, the point of the spiritual gift is not the technical  perfection of this skill.

It's whether or not it produces Christ's likeness in people. It's the blessing of God, not the form of the action that really makes a spiritual gift  a spiritual gift. This is the reason why you will know, let me give you two examples, there are preachers  whose sermons aren't all that good if you analyze them, and yet always give you life-changing  experiences of God. Why? Because it's not the form of the action, it's the blessing of God.

It's the reason why there are spiritual leaders who do a great job, they get people together  and they move people out and they get things done and people follow them, even though they  don't do any of the things they tell you at the Harvard MBA school you should do. Why? I am not saying, if I'm training a preacher, I'm going to talk about technical. I'm going to talk about, yeah, here's how you outline, so people don't lose your train,  you know, what you're trying to say. But in the end, what makes a spiritual gift, a spiritual gift, is not the technical excellence  of what you're doing, it's whether or not God is blessing it.

And as we seek to recognize gifts in ourselves and in the people around us, especially  in a place like New York where technique is so important, over the important, let's  remember that. So that is what it is. Spiritual gifts are differing abilities given by the Holy Spirit to each believer, to  meet needs, but in such a way that it creates Christ's likeness in a community of people. Secondly, now, if that's true, there's your theology. What are some of the practical implications of that?

What's that going to do? What kind of church does that create? Okay? Let me give you four, four practical implications, all right? The first one is, it means there will not be any passive unemployed Christians in a church.

If this theology is embraced, there will not be any passive unemployed people in a church. And I want you to, for a minute, just to think about the implications of this theology. There's a place in Ephesians 2 where, verse 10, where it says,  Because we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works which God  prepared in advance for us to do. You have been crafted and your unique abilities mean that there's certain great things that  you are the, that God wants you to do or put it this way. Take your gifts, which will be everybody's gifts are different, and the fact that you're  gender, your ethnicity, your experience in life, you put all those things together.

But this means there are some people in this world that need to be reached and you are  the best person in the world to reach them because of who you are. There are some deeds that need to be done, that God wants to be done in this world. And because of who you are, you are the very best person to do them. To understand your gifts and to exercise your gifts is to find your meaning in life,  your mission in life. We have trouble embracing these in churches and I'll give you two different ways.

We have trouble embracing the theology in two different ways. In small churches here's the problem. In small churches there's so much to be done and only a few people to do it. And very often in small churches you find people doing a lot of things that they are just  not gifted to do. And as a result they're overworked and burned out.

And very often they're not getting things done very well because they're not gifted  to do it. And that's partly because very often small churches kind of ignore the theology of spiritual  gifts but I want you to know it's in us big churches, a big church like Redeemer that  has a bigger problem than the small churches and here's the reason why. Spiritual gifts are output, ministry is output, ministry is spending yourself, giving yourself  serving, doing for other people. Many many many many many people come to a large church like Redeemer because they're not  going to be asked to do anything. You come because I can get input, lots of input, high quality input and nobody's going to  ask me for output especially if you are careful where you sit.

But if you come to a church and get mainly input and virtually no output meaning you are  not making yourself accountable, getting involved in other people's lives, speaking the truth  and loving to their lives, using your unique gifts in order to see them build into Christ  likeness. See if you're coming and doing input and you're not doing output that is you're coming  and you're not really doing anything else but attending, you are violating the will of  the Holy Spirit for your life. To each is given a gift. You are God's workmanship there are certain things that you and you alone can do and if  you and God's providence are here then the rest of us need you or you wouldn't be here. That doesn't waste people, he doesn't waste assets like the rest of us do.

And therefore it's absolutely crucial if we embrace the theology of the spiritual gifts  that there be no unemployed or passive Christians. That's the first implication, second implication. It also means we ought to expect, and I already kind of hinted at this, we ought to expect  a certain amount of contention and conflict in the church because of spiritual gifts. We need to expect it to a certain degree. With Christmas just around the corner, we are inviting people to sign up for our Advent  devotional series which you can receive daily from November 30th to December 24th.

The daily meditations will help you take time to think about the meaning and joy that comes  from Christ's birth. Each day of Advent you'll receive a devotional with a meditation on a Bible passage  that focuses on why Jesus came into the world, to reconcile us to our Heavenly Father. We believe that during this short season this is a great tool to help you focus on the  hope, joy, peace, and love we have through Christ's birth. You can sign up by visiting gospelonlife.com slash Advent. Again, to sign up, go to gospelonlife.com slash Advent.

In addition to the daily emails, you'll also receive a video message each Sunday. The weekly video message starts each week of Advent with a meditation from Tim Keller,  followed by a brief discussion with Tim and Kathy talking about something they noticed  in the meditation is our prayer that through this Advent series you experience the hope  and joy that comes from Christ's birth and that it is a source of encouragement to you  this Advent season. Now, I've told you this probably illustration before but a perfect illustration for it. When I was a brand new minister in my very first church and a small town of Virginia  was 24 years old and I remember the very first three days or maybe the first four days  or five but three people came to see me almost one after the other. Of course, they always want to, you know, people in the church want to come by and make  sure the young preacher gets his head on straight and see things the way they see them.

So that I remember the first day the guy comes and one person came and can't remember actually  who was the first one. But the very first day the person said, you see the trailers outside. We were in a poor part of town and there were trailers, people living in trailer  trailers around the church. And so you see those trailers out there I said, yes, I said, you know why we're not reaching  those people? None of those people come to our church.

You know why we're not reaching those people? We don't have a heart for evangelism. Those people do not know Christ or they don't go to church anywhere. We don't have a heart for evangelism. We ought to be out there sharing our faith with those people.

But this church doesn't do that, okay, duly noted. Today or two somebody else came by and said a different person says, you see those trailers  out there. They said, yes, I do. And they said, you know why, what the problem with this church is? I said, no, what?

Those are poor people. Those are people that are of a different social class. These are people with lots of problems and we don't want them in our church. That's the problem. The art church doesn't care about the poor.

Art church doesn't want the kind of problems that will come if they come in. They've got a lot of personal problems, they've got economic problems and we don't want  that. We don't know how to deal with that. That's the problem with this church. A lack of mercy, a lack of care for the poor, okay, a couple days later, maybe the next  day, somebody else came in and said to me, you see those trailers out there?

I said, yes, I do. And so do you know what the problem with our church is? Now for some reason, though it's 24 accidently, I said something wise and I said, no, what? You know, I already took notes, I already know what the problem with the church is. This person said, our church is a lot of people have a lot of very good, they have good  will, they've got really great intentions and they want to reach out to a neighborhood  and we don't know how to do it.

This is a blue collar church and we don't have people who are not organized. They don't know how to set up a project and execute it. They don't know how to get things done. They don't know how to get from here to there. They can set goals and they never get to them.

And you know, all three people were right and all three people had gifts that enabled  them to see what was wrong, that the other people didn't had different gifts and they didn't  see the same things. They're all right. And to some degree, there was contention, there has to be contention. On the other hand, when you use the theology of spiritual gifts, that enables everybody  to realize, oh, the reason why I see things the way I do is partly because I've got a gift. And I need to meet that need and in some sense, I have to honor what other people say  that I see theology of spiritual gifts gets you to expect a certain amount of chaos in  a church because a church that understands the theology of spiritual gifts realize that  there will be ministry bubbling up all over the place, from all sorts of places.

There will always be a certain energy about a church. If you really embrace the theology of spiritual gifts, a lot of churches don't want that. They want to be totally controlled from the top. They want to say, you know, if we have a ministry idea, we people at the top will tell you about  it. You don't have to tell us.

We'll tell you. And that destroys, that's against the theology of spiritual gifts. So if you embrace the theology of spiritual gifts, not only will it not have a passive congregation,  but at the same time, you will also have a certain amount of contention, a certain amount  of conflict, and people will be arguing what should we be doing, what should the priorities  be. And that's right. Why?

Because that's the work of Holy Spirit. Three. Nevertheless, a theology of the Holy Spirit though creates a certain amount of contention. Should destroy jealousy and pride. Every organization I know, there's some jealousy and pride going on because some people  end up being leaders and some people not.

Some people end up with more power and influence and some people with less. And the people with less distrust the people with more. Or maybe even our jealous are resentful of the people with more. At least they're mistrustful. And the people with more sometimes lord it over other people and feel very proud of  their position.

But the whole idea of spiritual gifts is that God has made all the appointments. He has made the appointment. So let me give you a case study. What do you do, oh Presbyterians, since we're Presbyterian Church, when you elect elders? What are you doing when you elect elders?

You're only recognizing the gifts that God has given. You're only recognizing the people that God has appointed. That's all. And if you understand that, then A, if you end up getting elected, you will have absolutely  no pride about it. And B, if you are not elected, if you're one of the people that does the electing, then  you say, this is God's appointment, this isn't people lobbying and getting their people behind  it and all that.

So this is just God's appointment. That's what should happen. The weird thing about the theology of spiritual gifts is on the one hand. If you embrace it, it creates more contention in jostling in the church. On the other hand, it should actually be a kind of lubrication so that as we talk and  as we contend and as we push, there is a great deal of respect.

There's no jealousy, there's no resentment, there's no pride, there's no arrogance. And lastly, the last implication, though, of this theology of spiritual gifts is not  just is, in a sense, we're getting there, fruit, spiritual fruit has got to be the real  goal and spiritual gifts have got to be seen only as the means. The spiritual gifts are only a means of the end of the fullness of the stature of the  character of Jesus Christ. Fruit and gifts are not the same thing, never mistake gifts for fruit. What do I mean?

Spiritual fruit, while we talked about that fairly recently, did we not? This year, spiritual fruit are listed in Galatians chapter 5. Spiritual fruit are character qualities, love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,  humility, integrity, self-control, and every Christian should have all the fruit. But spiritual gifts were being told, no Christian is all the spiritual gifts, why? The difference is, fruit has to do with your being, gifts is doing, fruit is your character  who you are, gifts are skills and what you do, never, ever, ever mistake gifts for fruit.

And I not only have to say that everywhere in the world because the Bible says it, but  I have to say particularly in New York, for the reasons I've already told you. In New York, there's a tremendous amount of emphasis on getting things done, talent and  so on. And here's what can easily happen. If you get busy, if you get busy, if you start to do things, you start to serve people,  you start to volunteer and people are helped by you. People love what you're doing and it doesn't even have to be through the church.

If you're always putting yourself out for people, so you're all these people depending  on you. You know what you can start to do? You can start to say, God is with me. Look at all the people that I'm helping. Look at all the people whose lives I'm touching.

God is with me. What are you doing? You're violating the theology of spiritual gifts. Gifts is not fruit. You're looking, let me tell you what your fruit is.

Do you find yourself getting happier and happier, no matter what your circumstances? More, more confident, even when things are bad, not always up and down emotionally. That's fruit. Do you find yourself getting humbler and humbler and caring less and less about criticism  what people are saying about you? Because you're so absolutely secure in God.

That's fruit. Do you find your prayer life being rich and you sense God's presence in His love and  that's the reason why you're not as emotionally up and down and you're able to take criticism  better and you're able to handle bad circumstance. That's fruit, but here's what goes on when you can be empty inside and you're really  not doing well with God and you're not growing in fruit yet you get out there and you help  people and you talk to people and you encourage people where you teach people and they say,  oh, you're helping me so much and then you start to feel good about yourself. Don't you dare do that. You know what you're doing?

You know what you're doing. Charles Spurgeon, a great Baptist preacher some years ago, many years ago now wrote a book  for his students, these are other ministry students and I'll never forget reading the  line. He said, don't go into the ministry to save your soul and I remember thinking, what idiot  would go into the ministry if he wasn't already saved, you know, being an idiot myself  at the time. And now I know what he meant. When you use spiritual gifts as a replacement for spiritual fruit, when you get busy as  a way of covering up your own unhappiness and emptiness on the inside and your own lack  of a decent relationship with God, you can be big stuff in a church, but ultimately it's  deadly, you know why?

Because gifts without fruit is like a tire without air. Gifts without fruit, you know, when your tire is losing air, if you're moving along, moving  along, it sort of stays up for a while and then when you come to a stoplight and there  have been plenty of people whose lives were going down the drain spiritually. And yet because they were very active, many ministers, of course, you know that. They're very famous. They do a whole lot of good and they're actually changing a lot of people's lives.

Why? Because their gifts are working. Inside, there are all kinds of problems, difficulties, you know, evil sin, you know, emptiness. They're covering it up and they look outside and they say look at that, they're the high  profile. They're mistaken gets for fruit, but anybody can do it and people are doing it all the  time.

You must not do that. The point is Christ's likeness in you, the point of Christ's likeness in those other people. And therefore, never mistake gifts for fruit. Fruit is the center, fruit is the end, you know, gifts are only the means. That's the theology of Holy Spirit and what a different kind of church it's going to be  if we embrace it.

Now that brings us to our last point and here's what we see, we're on the verge of needing  this last point. How can we use our spiritual gifts rightly? I like to show you, I just did show you, that there's all kinds of ways in which the  exercise of spiritual gifts is problematic. It can lead to power struggles and jealousy. In some case, it leads to passivity because people just don't embrace the theology at all.

It can lead to burnout because people are working really so hard to essentially fill up  an emptiness in their own lives instead of going to God whether they're using their ministry  and they're using their helping of other people in this way. There's all kinds of problems around spiritual gifts. How can we use them rightly? And the answer is one word. You see it here and you certainly see it in 1 Corinthians when Paul talks about it.

It's the word love. Notice, verse 15 and 16, the whole point is, speaking the truth in love, we'll build ourselves  up into the fullness of Christ. When every part of the body is doing its thing rightly, the body builds itself up in love  over and over, Paul never gets the spiritual gifts without talking about love. And of course, most famously in 1 Corinthians 12 and 14, he's talking about spiritual gifts  and smack in the middle of verse 13, chapter 13, Paul gives the famous passage on love. Why?

Because Paul says, over and over, if you're passive and not using your gifts, that's  just a lack of love, you're being selfish. If you're burnout and overworked because you're ministering to everybody and helping  everybody because out of an inner emptiness, it's because of a lack of love you don't really  have God's love in your life. If you're swaggering and powerful, it's a lack of love. If you're jealous and envious of somebody who's got the power, that's a lack of love. You need love, or the spiritual gifts are going to kill us, or the lack of the spiritual  gifts are going to kill us.

How do you get that love? You have to go to the part of the passage, which was the one part when it was read to you  that you didn't understand at all. That's the key. As it so often is, what is that? It's the beginning of the passage.

To each one of us grace has been given as Christ a portion of it. Whenever I've read this over the years, I read verse 7, then I get down to verse 11, which  makes sense again, and you keep reading. What is all this? This is why it says, when he ascended on high, he led captives in his train, he gave gifts  to men. What does he ascended?

He also descended to the lower earthly regions. He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens in order to fill  the whole universe. What that is, follow me and only take about 120 seconds, and you'll start to see the wonder  of what Paul is saying. In ancient times, if the king was in his city, and there was an enemy coming to invade  and enslave everyone, the king would go out to fight the enemy. If he won, if he delivered his people from oppression and captivity, he would return triumphantly,  and he would go back to his throne, he would ascend his throne, and sit down so his presence  was again in the midst of the people, and he would give gifts.

That is, he would take the riches that he'd won in his conquest, which would enrich the  entire city. Now in Psalm 68 verse 18, which is what Paul is quoting here, the Psalmist looks at a  particular incident, and reads it through that basic grid of what conquering kings would  do. They'd go out, save the people from oppression, ascend back in, bring in their presence,  and then give gifts. And they're looking at something that happened. The Psalmist was looking at the fact that David the king brought the ark of the covenant,  which represented the Shakana presence of God in the Jerusalem, ascended Mount Zion, which  is the place where in the Jerusalem where the Tabernacle was, and brought the ark of  the covenant into the Holy of Holies.

And the reason why this whole Psalm is celebrating that is in a way it's realizing God is the  ultimate king. And this is the end, it's the word of the Exodus, because God had brought the people out  of slavery, out of captivity. He defeated Egypt, and he brought them out of captivity. And now, finally, God was ascending his throne. And he was now present in the midst of his people in the Tabernacle.

And they were the fruits of that triumph, was milk and honey of the Promised Land. And so that's what the Psalmist is talking about, but Jesus, but listen, Paul always reads  the Old Testament, like you and I ought to read the Old Testament. He never can not, he can never stop thinking about Jesus. And he reads that Psalm about David bringing the ark, and the presence of God ascending  and gifts, and the triumph of God over oppression, and suddenly Paul realizes God was not done. When that was over, God was not done.

God the King had a bigger enemy to defeat sin and death, and God the King had a way of dwelling  in the midst of his people better than the ark in the Tabernacle. And God had even better spiritual gifts to give. And you know what happened? Here's how God did it. Jesus Christ descended.

That's the key. He descended. He descended from heaven to earth. He descended from honor and glory, to abuse and rejection, and to torture and death. He was humiliated.

He was destroyed. He descended. Why? When he went to the cross, you know what he was doing? He was defeating the Old Testament Egypt, sin and death, and he was getting pardoned for  our sins.

So not just the box, the ark of the covenant was a box which represented the presence of  God. So the Holy Spirit could actually come into our lives because our sins are atone for. So the presence of God could come into our midst, and we could get the ultimate spiritual  gifts which is the power of the Holy Spirit himself to bring people to a relationship  with God. That is love. David brought the ark of the covenant.

He brought the presence of God to the people at the risk of his life, but Jesus Christ  did it at the cost of his life. Jesus descended. He lost everything. There's love. And there's the love that you need.

Unless you are melted by and shaped by, and profoundly changed by, a knowledge of that  love. He did all that for you. All that for you. You are not able to really minister your spiritual gifts properly. But see that and you can.

So in the end, do you want to exercise your spiritual gifts rightly? Number one, you've got to have the Holy Spirit. You've got to be a Christian. You have to believe the gospel. You can't use your spiritual gifts if you don't have the Spirit.

Okay. Number two, how do I identify my spiritual gifts? Not as hard as you think. Try a lot of different kinds of ministries and then consult your own heart and consult  the church, consult the people around you. But thirdly, look at Jesus.

Look at this guy. Look at this perfect man in the gospels. See something so beautiful. See his character. See his holiness and yet his love.

See his forgiveness and yet his strength and boldness. See that and say, I don't want to just be happy anymore. I want to be like him. And I want all the people that I love around me to be like him. And now use your spiritual gifts.

Now it's safe. Let us pray. Thank you, Father, for giving us this great theology of spiritual gifts. And we pray that we here in New York City would embrace it. So we've been either passive and are proud.

So we would be constantly recognizing the wonderful chaos of spiritual gifts, but at the same  time, the knowledge that you have appointed, what you've appointed, keeps us, keeps our  pride down, makes us humble, makes us able to listen to other people. Most of all, oh Lord, we want to use our gifts to bear spiritual fruit in people's lives. And we ask that you would help us never forget that. Never forget our eyes filled with, we don't want to be star-eyed about gifts. What we really want is we want to see Christ's likeness grow in our own hearts and the hearts  of the people around us.

Make us a church in which that is what happens. We pray in Jesus' name, amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

Today Tim Keller is exploring how the Spirit calls us to faith, unites us together, equips  us with gifts, and shapes us to be more like Christ. Our scripture reading this morning is from Ephesians 4 verses 7 through 16. But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it. This is why it says, when he ascended on high, he led captives in his train and gave  gifts to men. What does he ascended mean, except that he also descended to the lower earthly regions?

He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens in order to fill  the whole universe. It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and  some to be pastors and teachers to prepare God's people for works of service, so that the  body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge  of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. Then we will no longer be infants tossed back and forth by the waves and blown here and  there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful  scheming. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the  head that is Christ. From him, the whole body joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds  itself up in love as each part does its work.

This is the word of the Lord. Now in our series on the Holy Spirit, we come to the subject of what the Bible calls  the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and you know, coming up on a good 40 years really in Christian  ministry, I know you wouldn't know that to look at me, but coming up on 40 years, I've  seen the pendulum in the church swing to such extreme places over the subject of spiritual  gifts. From obsessive focus on them to ignoring them, and I think we are going to see that  there is nothing more practical for helping us understand what a Christian church would  actually look like concretely on the ground than to embrace what the Bible gives us here  – a theology of spiritual gifts. So if we can avoid the extremes, we are going to learn a lot about what we should look  like. If this is your church, what this church should look like, if you come from some other  church, what your church there should look like.

Let's ask three questions of the text. What are spiritual gifts? Then what are the practical implications of the theology of spiritual gifts? What are the implications for church life? And thirdly, how can we rightly use spiritual gifts?

First, what are they? Let me give you a definition drawn from years of thinking about what the Bible says about  it. The definition is spiritual gifts are differing abilities given by a Holy Spirit to each  believer to meet needs in such a way that it creates a community of people who are growing  into the fullness of the character of Jesus Christ. Let me break that down into three parts for you. First of all, spiritual gifts are abilities to meet needs.

There are five lists of spiritual gifts in the Bible. There's actually one in Romans 12, there's two in 1 Corinthians 12, there's this  one here in Ephesians 4, there's one in 1 Peter 4, and every one of the lists is really  quite different. And it's pretty clear that each one is not exhaustive, it's illustrative, and even if you  put them all together, we don't have all the gifts listed. But if you read them all, you'll see there are clusters of gifts. Some gifts are the ability to communicate truth like evangelism, teaching.

Some gifts are the ability to bear burdens, so you have gifts of encouragement and of mercy  and of service and of helps of assistance. And some gifts are gifts to give direction, so you have leadership and administration  and wisdom which is a counseling gift, a way of giving an individual direction. But now look, there is no human need, spiritual, physical, psychological, relational that doesn't  have some spiritual gift that can address it. Spiritual gifts are the ability to address those kinds of needs. See, some spiritual gifts heal us when we're wounded or some spiritual gifts encourage  us where we're downcast.

Some spiritual gifts challenge us when we're lagging or correct us when we're going astray  or love us when we're being rejected or just inform us where we're ignorant. There is no human need that doesn't have some spiritual gift that can address it. So spiritual gifts are the abilities to address needs. Secondly, these spiritual gifts are different and yet given to every believer. See, it says, to each Christ has given a portion of the Spirit's power to meet needs.

In spite of the fact that we're all one, fundamentally in Christ, spiritual gifts create enormous  diversity, not only as we're going to see this as we go along. Not only do spiritual gifts make Christians differ a lot from person to person in what  they see and what they resonate to and how they look at the world and not only are individual  Christians incredibly different, but gifts make churches different from each other. Churches are very different from other churches because the gift mixes that are in those  churches can be very, very different than the gift mix of a church right across the street. And as a result, it's one of the reasons why you have this amazing diversity in the Christian  church. It's really one of the reasons why people are saying, why isn't the Christian church more?

Why is it so different? Why is there so many denominations? So many churches. Why? Why?

One of the reasons is this. Another reason is sin. One of the reasons is this. One of the reasons is this, but even though it makes it different, every believer, it does  not say to some believers, to super-believers, to certain believers, you get spiritual gifts  everyone. When it says to each one of us who's us Christians, Paul's not just saying us ministers  or something like that, to each.

So everybody gets a portion. Jesus has all the ministerial abilities to communicate truth, to bear burdens, to give  direction. He has all. We get a portion of his ministry ability to meet needs, but everyone gets one, and only  a portion. Now, thirdly, and this is actually the most important thing I'm going to press two or  three times here today.

What is the goal of spiritual gifts? What is the goal of ministry? Paul's sentences are very long, and they're even longer than they appear in the English,  because in English translators usually break his sentences into several sentences to make  a little bit clearer. Sometimes it's not that easy to tell what is the final goal of all this. You have everybody's getting a gift, and then you've got some of these more prominent  gifts like pastor's teachers, evangelist, prophets, and then to do what?

To equip people from the work of service, so everybody's doing their job, but what is  the ultimate goal? To build up the body until we reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son  of God and become mature attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. Now, that's a mouthful, but here's the purpose of all ministry. Ministry in the church, exercising a spiritual gift is not there just to make people happy  in some general way. First of all, it's to form us into a body.

Spiritual gifts make us a body. So I often have loved to say, there's a difference between an aggregation and a congregation. An aggregation is like a bag of marbles. There they are, a thousand marbles in a bag, and they're all next to each other, but  they're slipping and sliding, and they're not in any particular pattern. They have no particular relationship with each other, they're all in the same bag.

And there are churches that are aggregations, but a congregation is a body because every  gift makes you to differ from the other gifts, and yet your gift is absolutely necessary  in the church. And therefore, the Holy Spirit makes us a body, so you have your head and your hands and  your feet and your elbows, that's the image, but it means that everyone is not only different  unlike the marbles, but we are all intimately related to each other. So the Holy Spirit, especially spiritual gifts, make us a body, but the whole purpose of  all this ministry is to create Christ's likeness in one another. You don't just encourage in general, you don't just teach in general, you don't just help  in general. When spiritual gifts are exercised rightly, the result in the recipient of the ministry  is growing Christ's likeness, growing into the likeness of Jesus.

You know what that is? H.A. Cadbury was a professor of theology and Bible, Harvard from the 1930s, the 1950s,  and he loved getting undergraduate students who had never read the Bible, which of course  was quite a lot, even then. And he loved having, they'd all heard of Jesus, but just to have them read about Jesus, read  the accounts of what he was like, what he said, what he did, and just get what he called  their virgin reaction. And they're always shocked.

One of his students wrote this, you read about Jesus, who is he? What is he? Despite being absolutely approachable. This student wrote, Jesus, despite being absolutely approachable to the weakest and most broken  people, he is completely fearless before the proud and the corrupt. Despite being profoundly human and becoming weary and lonely and moved to joy and love  and anger, we never see him moody.

We never see him inconsistent. He is tender without being weak, strong without being harsh, humble without the slightest  lack of confidence. He has conviction without intolerance, enthusiasm without fanaticism, holiness without  Phariseism, passion without prejudice. This man alone never made a false step, never struck a jarring note. This is life at its highest.

And that is what spiritual gifts are supposed to produce. That's the point. When spiritual gifts are being used in the congregation, that's what results in the  lives of the people. And that is why, just the last thing I want to say about what spiritual gifts are, the  essence of a spiritual gift is the blessing of God, not the form of the action. And here's what I mean by that.

We live, I'll get back to those two. We live in New York City where what really matters is, I don't care about your accent,  they tell you here, I don't care where you're from, I don't even care how you address  what you look like, can you produce? Are you good enough? And so there's enormous emphasis on being talented and being gifted and being able to do  things. And what we have to recognize here is, the point of the spiritual gift is not the technical  perfection of this skill.

It's whether or not it produces Christ's likeness in people. It's the blessing of God, not the form of the action that really makes a spiritual gift  a spiritual gift. This is the reason why you will know, let me give you two examples, there are preachers  whose sermons aren't all that good if you analyze them, and yet always give you life-changing  experiences of God. Why? Because it's not the form of the action, it's the blessing of God.

It's the reason why there are spiritual leaders who do a great job, they get people together  and they move people out and they get things done and people follow them, even though they  don't do any of the things they tell you at the Harvard MBA school you should do. Why? I am not saying, if I'm training a preacher, I'm going to talk about technical. I'm going to talk about, yeah, here's how you outline, so people don't lose your train,  you know, what you're trying to say. But in the end, what makes a spiritual gift, a spiritual gift, is not the technical excellence  of what you're doing, it's whether or not God is blessing it.

And as we seek to recognize gifts in ourselves and in the people around us, especially  in a place like New York where technique is so important, over the important, let's  remember that. So that is what it is. Spiritual gifts are differing abilities given by the Holy Spirit to each believer, to  meet needs, but in such a way that it creates Christ's likeness in a community of people. Secondly, now, if that's true, there's your theology. What are some of the practical implications of that?

What's that going to do? What kind of church does that create? Okay? Let me give you four, four practical implications, all right? The first one is, it means there will not be any passive unemployed Christians in a church.

If this theology is embraced, there will not be any passive unemployed people in a church. And I want you to, for a minute, just to think about the implications of this theology. There's a place in Ephesians 2 where, verse 10, where it says,  Because we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works which God  prepared in advance for us to do. You have been crafted and your unique abilities mean that there's certain great things that  you are the, that God wants you to do or put it this way. Take your gifts, which will be everybody's gifts are different, and the fact that you're  gender, your ethnicity, your experience in life, you put all those things together.

But this means there are some people in this world that need to be reached and you are  the best person in the world to reach them because of who you are. There are some deeds that need to be done, that God wants to be done in this world. And because of who you are, you are the very best person to do them. To understand your gifts and to exercise your gifts is to find your meaning in life,  your mission in life. We have trouble embracing these in churches and I'll give you two different ways.

We have trouble embracing the theology in two different ways. In small churches here's the problem. In small churches there's so much to be done and only a few people to do it. And very often in small churches you find people doing a lot of things that they are just  not gifted to do. And as a result they're overworked and burned out.

And very often they're not getting things done very well because they're not gifted  to do it. And that's partly because very often small churches kind of ignore the theology of spiritual  gifts but I want you to know it's in us big churches, a big church like Redeemer that  has a bigger problem than the small churches and here's the reason why. Spiritual gifts are output, ministry is output, ministry is spending yourself, giving yourself  serving, doing for other people. Many many many many many people come to a large church like Redeemer because they're not  going to be asked to do anything. You come because I can get input, lots of input, high quality input and nobody's going to  ask me for output especially if you are careful where you sit.

But if you come to a church and get mainly input and virtually no output meaning you are  not making yourself accountable, getting involved in other people's lives, speaking the truth  and loving to their lives, using your unique gifts in order to see them build into Christ  likeness. See if you're coming and doing input and you're not doing output that is you're coming  and you're not really doing anything else but attending, you are violating the will of  the Holy Spirit for your life. To each is given a gift. You are God's workmanship there are certain things that you and you alone can do and if  you and God's providence are here then the rest of us need you or you wouldn't be here. That doesn't waste people, he doesn't waste assets like the rest of us do.

And therefore it's absolutely crucial if we embrace the theology of the spiritual gifts  that there be no unemployed or passive Christians. That's the first implication, second implication. It also means we ought to expect, and I already kind of hinted at this, we ought to expect  a certain amount of contention and conflict in the church because of spiritual gifts. We need to expect it to a certain degree. With Christmas just around the corner, we are inviting people to sign up for our Advent  devotional series which you can receive daily from November 30th to December 24th.

The daily meditations will help you take time to think about the meaning and joy that comes  from Christ's birth. Each day of Advent you'll receive a devotional with a meditation on a Bible passage  that focuses on why Jesus came into the world, to reconcile us to our Heavenly Father. We believe that during this short season this is a great tool to help you focus on the  hope, joy, peace, and love we have through Christ's birth. You can sign up by visiting gospelonlife.com slash Advent. Again, to sign up, go to gospelonlife.com slash Advent.

In addition to the daily emails, you'll also receive a video message each Sunday. The weekly video message starts each week of Advent with a meditation from Tim Keller,  followed by a brief discussion with Tim and Kathy talking about something they noticed  in the meditation is our prayer that through this Advent series you experience the hope  and joy that comes from Christ's birth and that it is a source of encouragement to you  this Advent season. Now, I've told you this probably illustration before but a perfect illustration for it. When I was a brand new minister in my very first church and a small town of Virginia  was 24 years old and I remember the very first three days or maybe the first four days  or five but three people came to see me almost one after the other. Of course, they always want to, you know, people in the church want to come by and make  sure the young preacher gets his head on straight and see things the way they see them.

So that I remember the first day the guy comes and one person came and can't remember actually  who was the first one. But the very first day the person said, you see the trailers outside. We were in a poor part of town and there were trailers, people living in trailer  trailers around the church. And so you see those trailers out there I said, yes, I said, you know why we're not reaching  those people? None of those people come to our church.

You know why we're not reaching those people? We don't have a heart for evangelism. Those people do not know Christ or they don't go to church anywhere. We don't have a heart for evangelism. We ought to be out there sharing our faith with those people.

But this church doesn't do that, okay, duly noted. Today or two somebody else came by and said a different person says, you see those trailers  out there. They said, yes, I do. And they said, you know why, what the problem with this church is? I said, no, what?

Those are poor people. Those are people that are of a different social class. These are people with lots of problems and we don't want them in our church. That's the problem. The art church doesn't care about the poor.

Art church doesn't want the kind of problems that will come if they come in. They've got a lot of personal problems, they've got economic problems and we don't want  that. We don't know how to deal with that. That's the problem with this church. A lack of mercy, a lack of care for the poor, okay, a couple days later, maybe the next  day, somebody else came in and said to me, you see those trailers out there?

I said, yes, I do. And so do you know what the problem with our church is? Now for some reason, though it's 24 accidently, I said something wise and I said, no, what? You know, I already took notes, I already know what the problem with the church is. This person said, our church is a lot of people have a lot of very good, they have good  will, they've got really great intentions and they want to reach out to a neighborhood  and we don't know how to do it.

This is a blue collar church and we don't have people who are not organized. They don't know how to set up a project and execute it. They don't know how to get things done. They don't know how to get from here to there. They can set goals and they never get to them.

And you know, all three people were right and all three people had gifts that enabled  them to see what was wrong, that the other people didn't had different gifts and they didn't  see the same things. They're all right. And to some degree, there was contention, there has to be contention. On the other hand, when you use the theology of spiritual gifts, that enables everybody  to realize, oh, the reason why I see things the way I do is partly because I've got a gift. And I need to meet that need and in some sense, I have to honor what other people say  that I see theology of spiritual gifts gets you to expect a certain amount of chaos in  a church because a church that understands the theology of spiritual gifts realize that  there will be ministry bubbling up all over the place, from all sorts of places.

There will always be a certain energy about a church. If you really embrace the theology of spiritual gifts, a lot of churches don't want that. They want to be totally controlled from the top. They want to say, you know, if we have a ministry idea, we people at the top will tell you about  it. You don't have to tell us.

We'll tell you. And that destroys, that's against the theology of spiritual gifts. So if you embrace the theology of spiritual gifts, not only will it not have a passive congregation,  but at the same time, you will also have a certain amount of contention, a certain amount  of conflict, and people will be arguing what should we be doing, what should the priorities  be. And that's right. Why?

Because that's the work of Holy Spirit. Three. Nevertheless, a theology of the Holy Spirit though creates a certain amount of contention. Should destroy jealousy and pride. Every organization I know, there's some jealousy and pride going on because some people  end up being leaders and some people not.

Some people end up with more power and influence and some people with less. And the people with less distrust the people with more. Or maybe even our jealous are resentful of the people with more. At least they're mistrustful. And the people with more sometimes lord it over other people and feel very proud of  their position.

But the whole idea of spiritual gifts is that God has made all the appointments. He has made the appointment. So let me give you a case study. What do you do, oh Presbyterians, since we're Presbyterian Church, when you elect elders? What are you doing when you elect elders?

You're only recognizing the gifts that God has given. You're only recognizing the people that God has appointed. That's all. And if you understand that, then A, if you end up getting elected, you will have absolutely  no pride about it. And B, if you are not elected, if you're one of the people that does the electing, then  you say, this is God's appointment, this isn't people lobbying and getting their people behind  it and all that.

So this is just God's appointment. That's what should happen. The weird thing about the theology of spiritual gifts is on the one hand. If you embrace it, it creates more contention in jostling in the church. On the other hand, it should actually be a kind of lubrication so that as we talk and  as we contend and as we push, there is a great deal of respect.

There's no jealousy, there's no resentment, there's no pride, there's no arrogance. And lastly, the last implication, though, of this theology of spiritual gifts is not  just is, in a sense, we're getting there, fruit, spiritual fruit has got to be the real  goal and spiritual gifts have got to be seen only as the means. The spiritual gifts are only a means of the end of the fullness of the stature of the  character of Jesus Christ. Fruit and gifts are not the same thing, never mistake gifts for fruit. What do I mean?

Spiritual fruit, while we talked about that fairly recently, did we not? This year, spiritual fruit are listed in Galatians chapter 5. Spiritual fruit are character qualities, love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,  humility, integrity, self-control, and every Christian should have all the fruit. But spiritual gifts were being told, no Christian is all the spiritual gifts, why? The difference is, fruit has to do with your being, gifts is doing, fruit is your character  who you are, gifts are skills and what you do, never, ever, ever mistake gifts for fruit.

And I not only have to say that everywhere in the world because the Bible says it, but  I have to say particularly in New York, for the reasons I've already told you. In New York, there's a tremendous amount of emphasis on getting things done, talent and  so on. And here's what can easily happen. If you get busy, if you get busy, if you start to do things, you start to serve people,  you start to volunteer and people are helped by you. People love what you're doing and it doesn't even have to be through the church.

If you're always putting yourself out for people, so you're all these people depending  on you. You know what you can start to do? You can start to say, God is with me. Look at all the people that I'm helping. Look at all the people whose lives I'm touching.

God is with me. What are you doing? You're violating the theology of spiritual gifts. Gifts is not fruit. You're looking, let me tell you what your fruit is.

Do you find yourself getting happier and happier, no matter what your circumstances? More, more confident, even when things are bad, not always up and down emotionally. That's fruit. Do you find yourself getting humbler and humbler and caring less and less about criticism  what people are saying about you? Because you're so absolutely secure in God.

That's fruit. Do you find your prayer life being rich and you sense God's presence in His love and  that's the reason why you're not as emotionally up and down and you're able to take criticism  better and you're able to handle bad circumstance. That's fruit, but here's what goes on when you can be empty inside and you're really  not doing well with God and you're not growing in fruit yet you get out there and you help  people and you talk to people and you encourage people where you teach people and they say,  oh, you're helping me so much and then you start to feel good about yourself. Don't you dare do that. You know what you're doing?

You know what you're doing. Charles Spurgeon, a great Baptist preacher some years ago, many years ago now wrote a book  for his students, these are other ministry students and I'll never forget reading the  line. He said, don't go into the ministry to save your soul and I remember thinking, what idiot  would go into the ministry if he wasn't already saved, you know, being an idiot myself  at the time. And now I know what he meant. When you use spiritual gifts as a replacement for spiritual fruit, when you get busy as  a way of covering up your own unhappiness and emptiness on the inside and your own lack  of a decent relationship with God, you can be big stuff in a church, but ultimately it's  deadly, you know why?

Because gifts without fruit is like a tire without air. Gifts without fruit, you know, when your tire is losing air, if you're moving along, moving  along, it sort of stays up for a while and then when you come to a stoplight and there  have been plenty of people whose lives were going down the drain spiritually. And yet because they were very active, many ministers, of course, you know that. They're very famous. They do a whole lot of good and they're actually changing a lot of people's lives.

Why? Because their gifts are working. Inside, there are all kinds of problems, difficulties, you know, evil sin, you know, emptiness. They're covering it up and they look outside and they say look at that, they're the high  profile. They're mistaken gets for fruit, but anybody can do it and people are doing it all the  time.

You must not do that. The point is Christ's likeness in you, the point of Christ's likeness in those other people. And therefore, never mistake gifts for fruit. Fruit is the center, fruit is the end, you know, gifts are only the means. That's the theology of Holy Spirit and what a different kind of church it's going to be  if we embrace it.

Now that brings us to our last point and here's what we see, we're on the verge of needing  this last point. How can we use our spiritual gifts rightly? I like to show you, I just did show you, that there's all kinds of ways in which the  exercise of spiritual gifts is problematic. It can lead to power struggles and jealousy. In some case, it leads to passivity because people just don't embrace the theology at all.

It can lead to burnout because people are working really so hard to essentially fill up  an emptiness in their own lives instead of going to God whether they're using their ministry  and they're using their helping of other people in this way. There's all kinds of problems around spiritual gifts. How can we use them rightly? And the answer is one word. You see it here and you certainly see it in 1 Corinthians when Paul talks about it.

It's the word love. Notice, verse 15 and 16, the whole point is, speaking the truth in love, we'll build ourselves  up into the fullness of Christ. When every part of the body is doing its thing rightly, the body builds itself up in love  over and over, Paul never gets the spiritual gifts without talking about love. And of course, most famously in 1 Corinthians 12 and 14, he's talking about spiritual gifts  and smack in the middle of verse 13, chapter 13, Paul gives the famous passage on love. Why?

Because Paul says, over and over, if you're passive and not using your gifts, that's  just a lack of love, you're being selfish. If you're burnout and overworked because you're ministering to everybody and helping  everybody because out of an inner emptiness, it's because of a lack of love you don't really  have God's love in your life. If you're swaggering and powerful, it's a lack of love. If you're jealous and envious of somebody who's got the power, that's a lack of love. You need love, or the spiritual gifts are going to kill us, or the lack of the spiritual  gifts are going to kill us.

How do you get that love? You have to go to the part of the passage, which was the one part when it was read to you  that you didn't understand at all. That's the key. As it so often is, what is that? It's the beginning of the passage.

To each one of us grace has been given as Christ a portion of it. Whenever I've read this over the years, I read verse 7, then I get down to verse 11, which  makes sense again, and you keep reading. What is all this? This is why it says, when he ascended on high, he led captives in his train, he gave gifts  to men. What does he ascended?

He also descended to the lower earthly regions. He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens in order to fill  the whole universe. What that is, follow me and only take about 120 seconds, and you'll start to see the wonder  of what Paul is saying. In ancient times, if the king was in his city, and there was an enemy coming to invade  and enslave everyone, the king would go out to fight the enemy. If he won, if he delivered his people from oppression and captivity, he would return triumphantly,  and he would go back to his throne, he would ascend his throne, and sit down so his presence  was again in the midst of the people, and he would give gifts.

That is, he would take the riches that he'd won in his conquest, which would enrich the  entire city. Now in Psalm 68 verse 18, which is what Paul is quoting here, the Psalmist looks at a  particular incident, and reads it through that basic grid of what conquering kings would  do. They'd go out, save the people from oppression, ascend back in, bring in their presence,  and then give gifts. And they're looking at something that happened. The Psalmist was looking at the fact that David the king brought the ark of the covenant,  which represented the Shakana presence of God in the Jerusalem, ascended Mount Zion, which  is the place where in the Jerusalem where the Tabernacle was, and brought the ark of  the covenant into the Holy of Holies.

And the reason why this whole Psalm is celebrating that is in a way it's realizing God is the  ultimate king. And this is the end, it's the word of the Exodus, because God had brought the people out  of slavery, out of captivity. He defeated Egypt, and he brought them out of captivity. And now, finally, God was ascending his throne. And he was now present in the midst of his people in the Tabernacle.

And they were the fruits of that triumph, was milk and honey of the Promised Land. And so that's what the Psalmist is talking about, but Jesus, but listen, Paul always reads  the Old Testament, like you and I ought to read the Old Testament. He never can not, he can never stop thinking about Jesus. And he reads that Psalm about David bringing the ark, and the presence of God ascending  and gifts, and the triumph of God over oppression, and suddenly Paul realizes God was not done. When that was over, God was not done.

God the King had a bigger enemy to defeat sin and death, and God the King had a way of dwelling  in the midst of his people better than the ark in the Tabernacle. And God had even better spiritual gifts to give. And you know what happened? Here's how God did it. Jesus Christ descended.

That's the key. He descended. He descended from heaven to earth. He descended from honor and glory, to abuse and rejection, and to torture and death. He was humiliated.

He was destroyed. He descended. Why? When he went to the cross, you know what he was doing? He was defeating the Old Testament Egypt, sin and death, and he was getting pardoned for  our sins.

So not just the box, the ark of the covenant was a box which represented the presence of  God. So the Holy Spirit could actually come into our lives because our sins are atone for. So the presence of God could come into our midst, and we could get the ultimate spiritual  gifts which is the power of the Holy Spirit himself to bring people to a relationship  with God. That is love. David brought the ark of the covenant.

He brought the presence of God to the people at the risk of his life, but Jesus Christ  did it at the cost of his life. Jesus descended. He lost everything. There's love. And there's the love that you need.

Unless you are melted by and shaped by, and profoundly changed by, a knowledge of that  love. He did all that for you. All that for you. You are not able to really minister your spiritual gifts properly. But see that and you can.

So in the end, do you want to exercise your spiritual gifts rightly? Number one, you've got to have the Holy Spirit. You've got to be a Christian. You have to believe the gospel. You can't use your spiritual gifts if you don't have the Spirit.

Okay. Number two, how do I identify my spiritual gifts? Not as hard as you think. Try a lot of different kinds of ministries and then consult your own heart and consult  the church, consult the people around you. But thirdly, look at Jesus.

Look at this guy. Look at this perfect man in the gospels. See something so beautiful. See his character. See his holiness and yet his love.

See his forgiveness and yet his strength and boldness. See that and say, I don't want to just be happy anymore. I want to be like him. And I want all the people that I love around me to be like him. And now use your spiritual gifts.

Now it's safe. Let us pray. Thank you, Father, for giving us this great theology of spiritual gifts. And we pray that we here in New York City would embrace it. So we've been either passive and are proud.

So we would be constantly recognizing the wonderful chaos of spiritual gifts, but at the same  time, the knowledge that you have appointed, what you've appointed, keeps us, keeps our  pride down, makes us humble, makes us able to listen to other people. Most of all, oh Lord, we want to use our gifts to bear spiritual fruit in people's lives. And we ask that you would help us never forget that. Never forget our eyes filled with, we don't want to be star-eyed about gifts. What we really want is we want to see Christ's likeness grow in our own hearts and the hearts  of the people around us.

Make us a church in which that is what happens. We pray in Jesus' name, amen.

### 引言：圣灵是谁？

圣灵是谁？为什么圣灵的工作对基督徒的生活如此重要？圣经告诉我们，圣灵不仅仅是一个模糊的力量，而是一个在基督徒生活中以深刻方式工作的位格。今天，Tim Keller 探讨圣灵如何呼召我们信仰，将我们联合在一起，赋予我们恩赐，并塑造我们更像基督。

我们今天早上的经文是以弗所书 4 章 7 到 16 节。

> “我们各人蒙恩，都是照基督所量给各人的恩赐。因此经上说：‘他升上高天的时候，掳掠了仇敌，将各样的恩赐赏给人。’既说升上，岂不是先降在地下吗？那降下的，就是远升诸天之上要充满万有的。他所赐的有使徒，有先知，有传福音的，有牧师和教师，为要成全圣徒，各尽其职，建立基督的身体，直等到我们众人在真道上同归于一，认识神的儿子，得以长大成人，满有基督长成的身量。使我们不再作小孩子，中了人的诡计和欺骗的法术，被一切异教之风摇动，飘来飘去，就随从各样的异端。惟用爱心说诚实话，凡事长进，连于元首基督。全身都靠他联络得合式，百节各按各职，照着各体的功用彼此相助，便叫身体渐渐增长，在爱中建立自己。”

这是主的话。

### 第一部分：什么是属灵的恩赐？

现在，在我们关于圣灵的系列中，我们来到圣经所称的圣灵的恩赐这个主题，你知道，在基督教事工中即将迎来 40 年，我知道你不会从外表看出来，但即将迎来 40 年，我看到教会在属灵恩赐这个主题上摆动到极端的地方。从对它们的过度关注到忽视它们，我认为我们将看到，没有什么比拥抱圣经在这里给我们的东西——属灵恩赐的神学，更能帮助我们理解基督教会在地面上实际应该是什么样子。

所以如果我们能避免极端，我们将学到很多关于我们应该是什么样子的东西。如果这是你的教会，这个教会应该是什么样子，如果你来自其他教会，你那里的教会应该是什么样子。

让我们向文本提出三个问题。什么是属灵的恩赐？然后，属灵恩赐的神学的实际意义是什么？对教会生活的意义是什么？第三，我们如何正确使用属灵的恩赐？

#### 1. 属灵恩赐的定义

首先，它们是什么？让我给你一个从多年思考圣经对它的描述中得出的定义。定义是，属灵恩赐是圣灵赋予每个信徒的不同能力，以满足需求，从而创造一个成长为耶稣基督品格丰满的人的社区。

让我为你分解成三个部分。

- **属灵恩赐是满足需求的能力。** 圣经中有五个属灵恩赐的列表。实际上，罗马书 12 章有一个，哥林多前书 12 章有两个，这里在以弗所书 4 章有一个，彼得前书 4 章有一个，每一个列表都非常不同。很明显，每一个都不是详尽无遗的，而是说明性的，即使你把它们全部放在一起，我们也没有列出所有的恩赐。

- **属灵恩赐是不同的，但却赋予每个信徒。** 看，它说，基督给每个人一部分圣灵的能力来满足需求。尽管我们在基督里基本上是一个，属灵恩赐创造了巨大的多样性，不仅是我们将要看到的。

- **属灵恩赐的目标是基督的样式。** 属灵恩赐的目标是什么？事工的目标是什么？保罗的句子很长，实际上比它们在英语中出现的还要长，因为英语译者通常将他的句子分成几个句子以使其更清晰。

### 第二部分：属灵恩赐的实际意义

其次，如果这是真的，那就是你的神学。这有什么实际意义？这会创造什么样的教会？

#### 1. 没有被动的基督徒

第一个是，这意味着在教会中不会有任何被动的失业基督徒。如果这个神学被接受，教会中就不会有任何被动的失业者。

#### 2. 期待争论

这也意味着我们应该期待，我已经暗示过这一点，我们应该期待教会中因为属灵恩赐而产生的一定程度的争论和冲突。

#### 3. 消除嫉妒和骄傲

尽管如此，圣灵的神学虽然创造了一定程度的争论。应该消除嫉妒和骄傲。

#### 4. 以果实为重

最后，这个属灵恩赐神学的最后一个意义不仅是，在某种意义上，我们正在接近，果实，属灵果实必须是真正的目标，而属灵恩赐必须被视为仅仅是手段。

### 第三部分：如何正确使用属灵恩赐

现在，这将我们带到最后一点，这就是我们看到的，我们正处于需要最后一点的边缘。我们如何正确使用属灵恩赐？

我想向你展示，我刚刚展示了，属灵恩赐的行使有各种各样的问题。它可能导致权力斗争和嫉妒。在某些情况下，它导致被动，因为人们根本不接受神学。

答案是一个词。你在这里看到它，你当然在保罗谈论它的哥林多前书中看到它。这个词是爱。

注意，第 15 和 16 节，整个重点是，用爱心说诚实话，我们将自己建立在基督的丰满中。当身体的每个部分都正确地做它的事情时，身体就会在爱中建立自己，保罗一次又一次地谈论属灵恩赐时，总是谈论爱。

> “如果你被动而不使用你的恩赐，那只是缺乏爱，你是自私的。”

你如何获得那种爱？你必须去到经文的部分，那是当它被读给你时你完全不理解的部分。那是关键。

> “我们各人蒙恩，都是照基督所量给各人的恩赐。”

多年来，每当我读到这段经文时，我读到第 7 节，然后我读到第 11 节，这又有意义了，然后你继续阅读。这一切是什么？

在古代，如果国王在他的城市里，并且有敌人要来入侵并奴役所有人，国王就会出去与敌人作战。如果他赢了，如果他解救了他的人民免于压迫和囚禁，他将凯旋而归，他将回到他的王位，他将升上他的王位，并坐下，这样他的存在再次在人民中间，然后他会给予礼物。

> “大卫带来了约柜。他冒着生命危险将神的同在带给人民，但耶稣基督却以生命的代价这样做。”

耶稣降下。他失去了一切。那就是爱。那就是你需要的爱。

除非你被这种爱融化、塑造，并被深刻地改变。他为你做了这一切。为你做了这一切。你无法真正正确地施展你的属灵恩赐。但看到这一点，你就可以。

所以最后，你想正确地施展你的属灵恩赐吗？首先，你必须拥有圣灵。你必须是基督徒。你必须相信福音。如果你没有圣灵，你就不能使用你的属灵恩赐。

第二，我如何识别我的属灵恩赐？并不像你想象的那么难。尝试各种不同类型的事工，然后咨询你自己的心，咨询教会，咨询你周围的人。

但第三，看耶稣。看这个人。看福音书中的这个完美的人。看到如此美丽的东西。看到他的品格。看到他的圣洁，但又看到他的爱。看到他的宽恕，但又看到他的力量和勇气。看到这一点，然后说，我不再只是想要快乐。我想像他一样。我希望我周围所有我爱的人都像他一样。现在使用你的属灵恩赐。现在是安全的。

让我们祈祷。

感谢父神，赐给我们这个伟大的属灵恩赐神学。我们祈祷，我们在纽约市会接受它。所以我们要么被动，要么骄傲。所以我们会不断认识到属灵恩赐的美妙混乱，但同时，你所指定的知识，保持我们的骄傲，使我们谦卑，使我们能够倾听他人。最重要的是，哦主，我们想用我们的恩赐在人的生命中结出属灵的果实。我们请求你帮助我们永远不要忘记这一点。永远不要让我们的眼睛充满，我们不想对恩赐充满星星眼。我们真正想要的是看到基督的样式在我们自己的心中和我们周围人的心中成长。让我们成为一个这样的教会。我们奉耶稣的名祈祷，阿门。
