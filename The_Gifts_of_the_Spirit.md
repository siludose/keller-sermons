## English Transcript / 英文原文

Today Tim Keller is exploring how the Spirit calls us to faith, unites us together, equips  us with gifts, and shapes us to be more like Christ. Our scripture reading this morning is from Ephesians 4 verses 7 through 16. But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it. This is why it says, when he ascended on high, he led captives in his train and gave  gifts to men. What does he ascended mean, except that he also descended to the lower earthly regions?

He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens in order to fill  the whole universe. It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and  some to be pastors and teachers to prepare God's people for works of service, so that the  body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge  of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. Then we will no longer be infants tossed back and forth by the waves and blown here and  there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful  scheming. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the  head that is Christ. From him, the whole body joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds  itself up in love as each part does its work.

This is the word of the Lord. Now in our series on the Holy Spirit, we come to the subject of what the Bible calls  the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and you know, coming up on a good 40 years really in Christian  ministry, I know you wouldn't know that to look at me, but coming up on 40 years, I've  seen the pendulum in the church swing to such extreme places over the subject of spiritual  gifts. From obsessive focus on them to ignoring them, and I think we are going to see that  there is nothing more practical for helping us understand what a Christian church would  actually look like concretely on the ground than to embrace what the Bible gives us here  – a theology of spiritual gifts. So if we can avoid the extremes, we are going to learn a lot about what we should look  like. If this is your church, what this church should look like, if you come from some other  church, what your church there should look like.

Let's ask three questions of the text. What are spiritual gifts? Then what are the practical implications of the theology of spiritual gifts? What are the implications for church life? And thirdly, how can we rightly use spiritual gifts?

First, what are they? Let me give you a definition drawn from years of thinking about what the Bible says about  it. The definition is spiritual gifts are differing abilities given by a Holy Spirit to each  believer to meet needs in such a way that it creates a community of people who are growing  into the fullness of the character of Jesus Christ. Let me break that down into three parts for you. First of all, spiritual gifts are abilities to meet needs.

There are five lists of spiritual gifts in the Bible. There's actually one in Romans 12, there's two in 1 Corinthians 12, there's this  one here in Ephesians 4, there's one in 1 Peter 4, and every one of the lists is really  quite different. And it's pretty clear that each one is not exhaustive, it's illustrative, and even if you  put them all together, we don't have all the gifts listed. But if you read them all, you'll see there are clusters of gifts. Some gifts are the ability to communicate truth like evangelism, teaching.

Some gifts are the ability to bear burdens, so you have gifts of encouragement and of mercy  and of service and of helps of assistance. And some gifts are gifts to give direction, so you have leadership and administration  and wisdom which is a counseling gift, a way of giving an individual direction. But now look, there is no human need, spiritual, physical, psychological, relational that doesn't  have some spiritual gift that can address it. Spiritual gifts are the ability to address those kinds of needs. See, some spiritual gifts heal us when we're wounded or some spiritual gifts encourage  us where we're downcast.

Some spiritual gifts challenge us when we're lagging or correct us when we're going astray  or love us when we're being rejected or just inform us where we're ignorant. There is no human need that doesn't have some spiritual gift that can address it. So spiritual gifts are the abilities to address needs. Secondly, these spiritual gifts are different and yet given to every believer. See, it says, to each Christ has given a portion of the Spirit's power to meet needs.

In spite of the fact that we're all one, fundamentally in Christ, spiritual gifts create enormous  diversity, not only as we're going to see this as we go along. Not only do spiritual gifts make Christians differ a lot from person to person in what  they see and what they resonate to and how they look at the world and not only are individual  Christians incredibly different, but gifts make churches different from each other. Churches are very different from other churches because the gift mixes that are in those  churches can be very, very different than the gift mix of a church right across the street. And as a result, it's one of the reasons why you have this amazing diversity in the Christian  church. It's really one of the reasons why people are saying, why isn't the Christian church more?

Why is it so different? Why is there so many denominations? So many churches. Why? Why?

One of the reasons is this. Another reason is sin. One of the reasons is this. One of the reasons is this, but even though it makes it different, every believer, it does  not say to some believers, to super-believers, to certain believers, you get spiritual gifts  everyone. When it says to each one of us who's us Christians, Paul's not just saying us ministers  or something like that, to each.

So everybody gets a portion. Jesus has all the ministerial abilities to communicate truth, to bear burdens, to give  direction. He has all. We get a portion of his ministry ability to meet needs, but everyone gets one, and only  a portion. Now, thirdly, and this is actually the most important thing I'm going to press two or  three times here today.

What is the goal of spiritual gifts? What is the goal of ministry? Paul's sentences are very long, and they're even longer than they appear in the English,  because in English translators usually break his sentences into several sentences to make  a little bit clearer. Sometimes it's not that easy to tell what is the final goal of all this. You have everybody's getting a gift, and then you've got some of these more prominent  gifts like pastor's teachers, evangelist, prophets, and then to do what?

To equip people from the work of service, so everybody's doing their job, but what is  the ultimate goal? To build up the body until we reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son  of God and become mature attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. Now, that's a mouthful, but here's the purpose of all ministry. Ministry in the church, exercising a spiritual gift is not there just to make people happy  in some general way. First of all, it's to form us into a body.

Spiritual gifts make us a body. So I often have loved to say, there's a difference between an aggregation and a congregation. An aggregation is like a bag of marbles. There they are, a thousand marbles in a bag, and they're all next to each other, but  they're slipping and sliding, and they're not in any particular pattern. They have no particular relationship with each other, they're all in the same bag.

And there are churches that are aggregations, but a congregation is a body because every  gift makes you to differ from the other gifts, and yet your gift is absolutely necessary  in the church. And therefore, the Holy Spirit makes us a body, so you have your head and your hands and  your feet and your elbows, that's the image, but it means that everyone is not only different  unlike the marbles, but we are all intimately related to each other. So the Holy Spirit, especially spiritual gifts, make us a body, but the whole purpose of  all this ministry is to create Christ's likeness in one another. You don't just encourage in general, you don't just teach in general, you don't just help  in general. When spiritual gifts are exercised rightly, the result in the recipient of the ministry  is growing Christ's likeness, growing into the likeness of Jesus.

You know what that is? H.A. Cadbury was a professor of theology and Bible, Harvard from the 1930s, the 1950s,  and he loved getting undergraduate students who had never read the Bible, which of course  was quite a lot, even then. And he loved having, they'd all heard of Jesus, but just to have them read about Jesus, read  the accounts of what he was like, what he said, what he did, and just get what he called  their virgin reaction. And they're always shocked.

One of his students wrote this, you read about Jesus, who is he? What is he? Despite being absolutely approachable. This student wrote, Jesus, despite being absolutely approachable to the weakest and most broken  people, he is completely fearless before the proud and the corrupt. Despite being profoundly human and becoming weary and lonely and moved to joy and love  and anger, we never see him moody.

We never see him inconsistent. He is tender without being weak, strong without being harsh, humble without the slightest  lack of confidence. He has conviction without intolerance, enthusiasm without fanaticism, holiness without  Phariseism, passion without prejudice. This man alone never made a false step, never struck a jarring note. This is life at its highest.

And that is what spiritual gifts are supposed to produce. That's the point. When spiritual gifts are being used in the congregation, that's what results in the  lives of the people. And that is why, just the last thing I want to say about what spiritual gifts are, the  essence of a spiritual gift is the blessing of God, not the form of the action. And here's what I mean by that.

We live, I'll get back to those two. We live in New York City where what really matters is, I don't care about your accent,  they tell you here, I don't care where you're from, I don't even care how you address  what you look like, can you produce? Are you good enough? And so there's enormous emphasis on being talented and being gifted and being able to do  things. And what we have to recognize here is, the point of the spiritual gift is not the technical  perfection of this skill.

It's whether or not it produces Christ's likeness in people. It's the blessing of God, not the form of the action that really makes a spiritual gift  a spiritual gift. This is the reason why you will know, let me give you two examples, there are preachers  whose sermons aren't all that good if you analyze them, and yet always give you life-changing  experiences of God. Why? Because it's not the form of the action, it's the blessing of God.

It's the reason why there are spiritual leaders who do a great job, they get people together  and they move people out and they get things done and people follow them, even though they  don't do any of the things they tell you at the Harvard MBA school you should do. Why? I am not saying, if I'm training a preacher, I'm going to talk about technical. I'm going to talk about, yeah, here's how you outline, so people don't lose your train,  you know, what you're trying to say. But in the end, what makes a spiritual gift, a spiritual gift, is not the technical excellence  of what you're doing, it's whether or not God is blessing it.

And as we seek to recognize gifts in ourselves and in the people around us, especially  in a place like New York where technique is so important, over the important, let's  remember that. So that is what it is. Spiritual gifts are differing abilities given by the Holy Spirit to each believer, to  meet needs, but in such a way that it creates Christ's likeness in a community of people. Secondly, now, if that's true, there's your theology. What are some of the practical implications of that?

What's that going to do? What kind of church does that create? Okay? Let me give you four, four practical implications, all right? The first one is, it means there will not be any passive unemployed Christians in a church.

If this theology is embraced, there will not be any passive unemployed people in a church. And I want you to, for a minute, just to think about the implications of this theology. There's a place in Ephesians 2 where, verse 10, where it says,  Because we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works which God  prepared in advance for us to do. You have been crafted and your unique abilities mean that there's certain great things that  you are the, that God wants you to do or put it this way. Take your gifts, which will be everybody's gifts are different, and the fact that you're  gender, your ethnicity, your experience in life, you put all those things together.

But this means there are some people in this world that need to be reached and you are  the best person in the world to reach them because of who you are. There are some deeds that need to be done, that God wants to be done in this world. And because of who you are, you are the very best person to do them. To understand your gifts and to exercise your gifts is to find your meaning in life,  your mission in life. We have trouble embracing these in churches and I'll give you two different ways.

We have trouble embracing the theology in two different ways. In small churches here's the problem. In small churches there's so much to be done and only a few people to do it. And very often in small churches you find people doing a lot of things that they are just  not gifted to do. And as a result they're overworked and burned out.

And very often they're not getting things done very well because they're not gifted  to do it. And that's partly because very often small churches kind of ignore the theology of spiritual  gifts but I want you to know it's in us big churches, a big church like Redeemer that  has a bigger problem than the small churches and here's the reason why. Spiritual gifts are output, ministry is output, ministry is spending yourself, giving yourself  serving, doing for other people. Many many many many many people come to a large church like Redeemer because they're not  going to be asked to do anything. You come because I can get input, lots of input, high quality input and nobody's going to  ask me for output especially if you are careful where you sit.

But if you come to a church and get mainly input and virtually no output meaning you are  not making yourself accountable, getting involved in other people's lives, speaking the truth  and loving to their lives, using your unique gifts in order to see them build into Christ  likeness. See if you're coming and doing input and you're not doing output that is you're coming  and you're not really doing anything else but attending, you are violating the will of  the Holy Spirit for your life. To each is given a gift. You are God's workmanship there are certain things that you and you alone can do and if  you and God's providence are here then the rest of us need you or you wouldn't be here. That doesn't waste people, he doesn't waste assets like the rest of us do.

And therefore it's absolutely crucial if we embrace the theology of the spiritual gifts  that there be no unemployed or passive Christians. That's the first implication, second implication. It also means we ought to expect, and I already kind of hinted at this, we ought to expect  a certain amount of contention and conflict in the church because of spiritual gifts. We need to expect it to a certain degree. With Christmas just around the corner, we are inviting people to sign up for our Advent  devotional series which you can receive daily from November 30th to December 24th.

The daily meditations will help you take time to think about the meaning and joy that comes  from Christ's birth. Each day of Advent you'll receive a devotional with a meditation on a Bible passage  that focuses on why Jesus came into the world, to reconcile us to our Heavenly Father. We believe that during this short season this is a great tool to help you focus on the  hope, joy, peace, and love we have through Christ's birth. You can sign up by visiting gospelonlife.com slash Advent. Again, to sign up, go to gospelonlife.com slash Advent.

In addition to the daily emails, you'll also receive a video message each Sunday. The weekly video message starts each week of Advent with a meditation from Tim Keller,  followed by a brief discussion with Tim and Kathy talking about something they noticed  in the meditation is our prayer that through this Advent series you experience the hope  and joy that comes from Christ's birth and that it is a source of encouragement to you  this Advent season. Now, I've told you this probably illustration before but a perfect illustration for it. When I was a brand new minister in my very first church and a small town of Virginia  was 24 years old and I remember the very first three days or maybe the first four days  or five but three people came to see me almost one after the other. Of course, they always want to, you know, people in the church want to come by and make  sure the young preacher gets his head on straight and see things the way they see them.

So that I remember the first day the guy comes and one person came and can't remember actually  who was the first one. But the very first day the person said, you see the trailers outside. We were in a poor part of town and there were trailers, people living in trailer  trailers around the church. And so you see those trailers out there I said, yes, I said, you know why we're not reaching  those people? None of those people come to our church.

You know why we're not reaching those people? We don't have a heart for evangelism. Those people do not know Christ or they don't go to church anywhere. We don't have a heart for evangelism. We ought to be out there sharing our faith with those people.

But this church doesn't do that, okay, duly noted. Today or two somebody else came by and said a different person says, you see those trailers  out there. They said, yes, I do. And they said, you know why, what the problem with this church is? I said, no, what?

Those are poor people. Those are people that are of a different social class. These are people with lots of problems and we don't want them in our church. That's the problem. The art church doesn't care about the poor.

Art church doesn't want the kind of problems that will come if they come in. They've got a lot of personal problems, they've got economic problems and we don't want  that. We don't know how to deal with that. That's the problem with this church. A lack of mercy, a lack of care for the poor, okay, a couple days later, maybe the next  day, somebody else came in and said to me, you see those trailers out there?

I said, yes, I do. And so do you know what the problem with our church is? Now for some reason, though it's 24 accidently, I said something wise and I said, no, what? You know, I already took notes, I already know what the problem with the church is. This person said, our church is a lot of people have a lot of very good, they have good  will, they've got really great intentions and they want to reach out to a neighborhood  and we don't know how to do it.

This is a blue collar church and we don't have people who are not organized. They don't know how to set up a project and execute it. They don't know how to get things done. They don't know how to get from here to there. They can set goals and they never get to them.

And you know, all three people were right and all three people had gifts that enabled  them to see what was wrong, that the other people didn't had different gifts and they didn't  see the same things. They're all right. And to some degree, there was contention, there has to be contention. On the other hand, when you use the theology of spiritual gifts, that enables everybody  to realize, oh, the reason why I see things the way I do is partly because I've got a gift. And I need to meet that need and in some sense, I have to honor what other people say  that I see theology of spiritual gifts gets you to expect a certain amount of chaos in  a church because a church that understands the theology of spiritual gifts realize that  there will be ministry bubbling up all over the place, from all sorts of places.

There will always be a certain energy about a church. If you really embrace the theology of spiritual gifts, a lot of churches don't want that. They want to be totally controlled from the top. They want to say, you know, if we have a ministry idea, we people at the top will tell you about  it. You don't have to tell us.

We'll tell you. And that destroys, that's against the theology of spiritual gifts. So if you embrace the theology of spiritual gifts, not only will it not have a passive congregation,  but at the same time, you will also have a certain amount of contention, a certain amount  of conflict, and people will be arguing what should we be doing, what should the priorities  be. And that's right. Why?

Because that's the work of Holy Spirit. Three. Nevertheless, a theology of the Holy Spirit though creates a certain amount of contention. Should destroy jealousy and pride. Every organization I know, there's some jealousy and pride going on because some people  end up being leaders and some people not.

Some people end up with more power and influence and some people with less. And the people with less distrust the people with more. Or maybe even our jealous are resentful of the people with more. At least they're mistrustful. And the people with more sometimes lord it over other people and feel very proud of  their position.

But the whole idea of spiritual gifts is that God has made all the appointments. He has made the appointment. So let me give you a case study. What do you do, oh Presbyterians, since we're Presbyterian Church, when you elect elders? What are you doing when you elect elders?

You're only recognizing the gifts that God has given. You're only recognizing the people that God has appointed. That's all. And if you understand that, then A, if you end up getting elected, you will have absolutely  no pride about it. And B, if you are not elected, if you're one of the people that does the electing, then  you say, this is God's appointment, this isn't people lobbying and getting their people behind  it and all that.

So this is just God's appointment. That's what should happen. The weird thing about the theology of spiritual gifts is on the one hand. If you embrace it, it creates more contention in jostling in the church. On the other hand, it should actually be a kind of lubrication so that as we talk and  as we contend and as we push, there is a great deal of respect.

There's no jealousy, there's no resentment, there's no pride, there's no arrogance. And lastly, the last implication, though, of this theology of spiritual gifts is not  just is, in a sense, we're getting there, fruit, spiritual fruit has got to be the real  goal and spiritual gifts have got to be seen only as the means. The spiritual gifts are only a means of the end of the fullness of the stature of the  character of Jesus Christ. Fruit and gifts are not the same thing, never mistake gifts for fruit. What do I mean?

Spiritual fruit, while we talked about that fairly recently, did we not? This year, spiritual fruit are listed in Galatians chapter 5. Spiritual fruit are character qualities, love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,  humility, integrity, self-control, and every Christian should have all the fruit. But spiritual gifts were being told, no Christian is all the spiritual gifts, why? The difference is, fruit has to do with your being, gifts is doing, fruit is your character  who you are, gifts are skills and what you do, never, ever, ever mistake gifts for fruit.

And I not only have to say that everywhere in the world because the Bible says it, but  I have to say particularly in New York, for the reasons I've already told you. In New York, there's a tremendous amount of emphasis on getting things done, talent and  so on. And here's what can easily happen. If you get busy, if you get busy, if you start to do things, you start to serve people,  you start to volunteer and people are helped by you. People love what you're doing and it doesn't even have to be through the church.

If you're always putting yourself out for people, so you're all these people depending  on you. You know what you can start to do? You can start to say, God is with me. Look at all the people that I'm helping. Look at all the people whose lives I'm touching.

God is with me. What are you doing? You're violating the theology of spiritual gifts. Gifts is not fruit. You're looking, let me tell you what your fruit is.

Do you find yourself getting happier and happier, no matter what your circumstances? More, more confident, even when things are bad, not always up and down emotionally. That's fruit. Do you find yourself getting humbler and humbler and caring less and less about criticism  what people are saying about you? Because you're so absolutely secure in God.

That's fruit. Do you find your prayer life being rich and you sense God's presence in His love and  that's the reason why you're not as emotionally up and down and you're able to take criticism  better and you're able to handle bad circumstance. That's fruit, but here's what goes on when you can be empty inside and you're really  not doing well with God and you're not growing in fruit yet you get out there and you help  people and you talk to people and you encourage people where you teach people and they say,  oh, you're helping me so much and then you start to feel good about yourself. Don't you dare do that. You know what you're doing?

You know what you're doing. Charles Spurgeon, a great Baptist preacher some years ago, many years ago now wrote a book  for his students, these are other ministry students and I'll never forget reading the  line. He said, don't go into the ministry to save your soul and I remember thinking, what idiot  would go into the ministry if he wasn't already saved, you know, being an idiot myself  at the time. And now I know what he meant. When you use spiritual gifts as a replacement for spiritual fruit, when you get busy as  a way of covering up your own unhappiness and emptiness on the inside and your own lack  of a decent relationship with God, you can be big stuff in a church, but ultimately it's  deadly, you know why?

Because gifts without fruit is like a tire without air. Gifts without fruit, you know, when your tire is losing air, if you're moving along, moving  along, it sort of stays up for a while and then when you come to a stoplight and there  have been plenty of people whose lives were going down the drain spiritually. And yet because they were very active, many ministers, of course, you know that. They're very famous. They do a whole lot of good and they're actually changing a lot of people's lives.

Why? Because their gifts are working. Inside, there are all kinds of problems, difficulties, you know, evil sin, you know, emptiness. They're covering it up and they look outside and they say look at that, they're the high  profile. They're mistaken gets for fruit, but anybody can do it and people are doing it all the  time.

You must not do that. The point is Christ's likeness in you, the point of Christ's likeness in those other people. And therefore, never mistake gifts for fruit. Fruit is the center, fruit is the end, you know, gifts are only the means. That's the theology of Holy Spirit and what a different kind of church it's going to be  if we embrace it.

Now that brings us to our last point and here's what we see, we're on the verge of needing  this last point. How can we use our spiritual gifts rightly? I like to show you, I just did show you, that there's all kinds of ways in which the  exercise of spiritual gifts is problematic. It can lead to power struggles and jealousy. In some case, it leads to passivity because people just don't embrace the theology at all.

It can lead to burnout because people are working really so hard to essentially fill up  an emptiness in their own lives instead of going to God whether they're using their ministry  and they're using their helping of other people in this way. There's all kinds of problems around spiritual gifts. How can we use them rightly? And the answer is one word. You see it here and you certainly see it in 1 Corinthians when Paul talks about it.

It's the word love. Notice, verse 15 and 16, the whole point is, speaking the truth in love, we'll build ourselves  up into the fullness of Christ. When every part of the body is doing its thing rightly, the body builds itself up in love  over and over, Paul never gets the spiritual gifts without talking about love. And of course, most famously in 1 Corinthians 12 and 14, he's talking about spiritual gifts  and smack in the middle of verse 13, chapter 13, Paul gives the famous passage on love. Why?

Because Paul says, over and over, if you're passive and not using your gifts, that's  just a lack of love, you're being selfish. If you're burnout and overworked because you're ministering to everybody and helping  everybody because out of an inner emptiness, it's because of a lack of love you don't really  have God's love in your life. If you're swaggering and powerful, it's a lack of love. If you're jealous and envious of somebody who's got the power, that's a lack of love. You need love, or the spiritual gifts are going to kill us, or the lack of the spiritual  gifts are going to kill us.

How do you get that love? You have to go to the part of the passage, which was the one part when it was read to you  that you didn't understand at all. That's the key. As it so often is, what is that? It's the beginning of the passage.

To each one of us grace has been given as Christ a portion of it. Whenever I've read this over the years, I read verse 7, then I get down to verse 11, which  makes sense again, and you keep reading. What is all this? This is why it says, when he ascended on high, he led captives in his train, he gave gifts  to men. What does he ascended?

He also descended to the lower earthly regions. He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens in order to fill  the whole universe. What that is, follow me and only take about 120 seconds, and you'll start to see the wonder  of what Paul is saying. In ancient times, if the king was in his city, and there was an enemy coming to invade  and enslave everyone, the king would go out to fight the enemy. If he won, if he delivered his people from oppression and captivity, he would return triumphantly,  and he would go back to his throne, he would ascend his throne, and sit down so his presence  was again in the midst of the people, and he would give gifts.

That is, he would take the riches that he'd won in his conquest, which would enrich the  entire city. Now in Psalm 68 verse 18, which is what Paul is quoting here, the Psalmist looks at a  particular incident, and reads it through that basic grid of what conquering kings would  do. They'd go out, save the people from oppression, ascend back in, bring in their presence,  and then give gifts. And they're looking at something that happened. The Psalmist was looking at the fact that David the king brought the ark of the covenant,  which represented the Shakana presence of God in the Jerusalem, ascended Mount Zion, which  is the place where in the Jerusalem where the Tabernacle was, and brought the ark of  the covenant into the Holy of Holies.

And the reason why this whole Psalm is celebrating that is in a way it's realizing God is the  ultimate king. And this is the end, it's the word of the Exodus, because God had brought the people out  of slavery, out of captivity. He defeated Egypt, and he brought them out of captivity. And now, finally, God was ascending his throne. And he was now present in the midst of his people in the Tabernacle.

And they were the fruits of that triumph, was milk and honey of the Promised Land. And so that's what the Psalmist is talking about, but Jesus, but listen, Paul always reads  the Old Testament, like you and I ought to read the Old Testament. He never can not, he can never stop thinking about Jesus. And he reads that Psalm about David bringing the ark, and the presence of God ascending  and gifts, and the triumph of God over oppression, and suddenly Paul realizes God was not done. When that was over, God was not done.

God the King had a bigger enemy to defeat sin and death, and God the King had a way of dwelling  in the midst of his people better than the ark in the Tabernacle. And God had even better spiritual gifts to give. And you know what happened? Here's how God did it. Jesus Christ descended.

That's the key. He descended. He descended from heaven to earth. He descended from honor and glory, to abuse and rejection, and to torture and death. He was humiliated.

He was destroyed. He descended. Why? When he went to the cross, you know what he was doing? He was defeating the Old Testament Egypt, sin and death, and he was getting pardoned for  our sins.

So not just the box, the ark of the covenant was a box which represented the presence of  God. So the Holy Spirit could actually come into our lives because our sins are atone for. So the presence of God could come into our midst, and we could get the ultimate spiritual  gifts which is the power of the Holy Spirit himself to bring people to a relationship  with God. That is love. David brought the ark of the covenant.

He brought the presence of God to the people at the risk of his life, but Jesus Christ  did it at the cost of his life. Jesus descended. He lost everything. There's love. And there's the love that you need.

Unless you are melted by and shaped by, and profoundly changed by, a knowledge of that  love. He did all that for you. All that for you. You are not able to really minister your spiritual gifts properly. But see that and you can.

So in the end, do you want to exercise your spiritual gifts rightly? Number one, you've got to have the Holy Spirit. You've got to be a Christian. You have to believe the gospel. You can't use your spiritual gifts if you don't have the Spirit.

Okay. Number two, how do I identify my spiritual gifts? Not as hard as you think. Try a lot of different kinds of ministries and then consult your own heart and consult  the church, consult the people around you. But thirdly, look at Jesus.

Look at this guy. Look at this perfect man in the gospels. See something so beautiful. See his character. See his holiness and yet his love.

See his forgiveness and yet his strength and boldness. See that and say, I don't want to just be happy anymore. I want to be like him. And I want all the people that I love around me to be like him. And now use your spiritual gifts.

Now it's safe. Let us pray. Thank you, Father, for giving us this great theology of spiritual gifts. And we pray that we here in New York City would embrace it. So we've been either passive and are proud.

So we would be constantly recognizing the wonderful chaos of spiritual gifts, but at the same  time, the knowledge that you have appointed, what you've appointed, keeps us, keeps our  pride down, makes us humble, makes us able to listen to other people. Most of all, oh Lord, we want to use our gifts to bear spiritual fruit in people's lives. And we ask that you would help us never forget that. Never forget our eyes filled with, we don't want to be star-eyed about gifts. What we really want is we want to see Christ's likeness grow in our own hearts and the hearts  of the people around us.

Make us a church in which that is what happens. We pray in Jesus' name, amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

Today Tim Keller is exploring how the Spirit calls us to faith, unites us together, equips  us with gifts, and shapes us to be more like Christ. Our scripture reading this morning is from Ephesians 4 verses 7 through 16. But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it. This is why it says, when he ascended on high, he led captives in his train and gave  gifts to men. What does he ascended mean, except that he also descended to the lower earthly regions?

He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens in order to fill  the whole universe. It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and  some to be pastors and teachers to prepare God's people for works of service, so that the  body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge  of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. Then we will no longer be infants tossed back and forth by the waves and blown here and  there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful  scheming. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the  head that is Christ. From him, the whole body joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds  itself up in love as each part does its work.

This is the word of the Lord. Now in our series on the Holy Spirit, we come to the subject of what the Bible calls  the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and you know, coming up on a good 40 years really in Christian  ministry, I know you wouldn't know that to look at me, but coming up on 40 years, I've  seen the pendulum in the church swing to such extreme places over the subject of spiritual  gifts. From obsessive focus on them to ignoring them, and I think we are going to see that  there is nothing more practical for helping us understand what a Christian church would  actually look like concretely on the ground than to embrace what the Bible gives us here  – a theology of spiritual gifts. So if we can avoid the extremes, we are going to learn a lot about what we should look  like. If this is your church, what this church should look like, if you come from some other  church, what your church there should look like.

Let's ask three questions of the text. What are spiritual gifts? Then what are the practical implications of the theology of spiritual gifts? What are the implications for church life? And thirdly, how can we rightly use spiritual gifts?

First, what are they? Let me give you a definition drawn from years of thinking about what the Bible says about  it. The definition is spiritual gifts are differing abilities given by a Holy Spirit to each  believer to meet needs in such a way that it creates a community of people who are growing  into the fullness of the character of Jesus Christ. Let me break that down into three parts for you. First of all, spiritual gifts are abilities to meet needs.

There are five lists of spiritual gifts in the Bible. There's actually one in Romans 12, there's two in 1 Corinthians 12, there's this  one here in Ephesians 4, there's one in 1 Peter 4, and every one of the lists is really  quite different. And it's pretty clear that each one is not exhaustive, it's illustrative, and even if you  put them all together, we don't have all the gifts listed. But if you read them all, you'll see there are clusters of gifts. Some gifts are the ability to communicate truth like evangelism, teaching.

Some gifts are the ability to bear burdens, so you have gifts of encouragement and of mercy  and of service and of helps of assistance. And some gifts are gifts to give direction, so you have leadership and administration  and wisdom which is a counseling gift, a way of giving an individual direction. But now look, there is no human need, spiritual, physical, psychological, relational that doesn't  have some spiritual gift that can address it. Spiritual gifts are the ability to address those kinds of needs. See, some spiritual gifts heal us when we're wounded or some spiritual gifts encourage  us where we're downcast.

Some spiritual gifts challenge us when we're lagging or correct us when we're going astray  or love us when we're being rejected or just inform us where we're ignorant. There is no human need that doesn't have some spiritual gift that can address it. So spiritual gifts are the abilities to address needs. Secondly, these spiritual gifts are different and yet given to every believer. See, it says, to each Christ has given a portion of the Spirit's power to meet needs.

In spite of the fact that we're all one, fundamentally in Christ, spiritual gifts create enormous  diversity, not only as we're going to see this as we go along. Not only do spiritual gifts make Christians differ a lot from person to person in what  they see and what they resonate to and how they look at the world and not only are individual  Christians incredibly different, but gifts make churches different from each other. Churches are very different from other churches because the gift mixes that are in those  churches can be very, very different than the gift mix of a church right across the street. And as a result, it's one of the reasons why you have this amazing diversity in the Christian  church. It's really one of the reasons why people are saying, why isn't the Christian church more?

Why is it so different? Why is there so many denominations? So many churches. Why? Why?

One of the reasons is this. Another reason is sin. One of the reasons is this. One of the reasons is this, but even though it makes it different, every believer, it does  not say to some believers, to super-believers, to certain believers, you get spiritual gifts  everyone. When it says to each one of us who's us Christians, Paul's not just saying us ministers  or something like that, to each.

So everybody gets a portion. Jesus has all the ministerial abilities to communicate truth, to bear burdens, to give  direction. He has all. We get a portion of his ministry ability to meet needs, but everyone gets one, and only  a portion. Now, thirdly, and this is actually the most important thing I'm going to press two or  three times here today.

What is the goal of spiritual gifts? What is the goal of ministry? Paul's sentences are very long, and they're even longer than they appear in the English,  because in English translators usually break his sentences into several sentences to make  a little bit clearer. Sometimes it's not that easy to tell what is the final goal of all this. You have everybody's getting a gift, and then you've got some of these more prominent  gifts like pastor's teachers, evangelist, prophets, and then to do what?

To equip people from the work of service, so everybody's doing their job, but what is  the ultimate goal? To build up the body until we reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son  of God and become mature attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. Now, that's a mouthful, but here's the purpose of all ministry. Ministry in the church, exercising a spiritual gift is not there just to make people happy  in some general way. First of all, it's to form us into a body.

Spiritual gifts make us a body. So I often have loved to say, there's a difference between an aggregation and a congregation. An aggregation is like a bag of marbles. There they are, a thousand marbles in a bag, and they're all next to each other, but  they're slipping and sliding, and they're not in any particular pattern. They have no particular relationship with each other, they're all in the same bag.

And there are churches that are aggregations, but a congregation is a body because every  gift makes you to differ from the other gifts, and yet your gift is absolutely necessary  in the church. And therefore, the Holy Spirit makes us a body, so you have your head and your hands and  your feet and your elbows, that's the image, but it means that everyone is not only different  unlike the marbles, but we are all intimately related to each other. So the Holy Spirit, especially spiritual gifts, make us a body, but the whole purpose of  all this ministry is to create Christ's likeness in one another. You don't just encourage in general, you don't just teach in general, you don't just help  in general. When spiritual gifts are exercised rightly, the result in the recipient of the ministry  is growing Christ's likeness, growing into the likeness of Jesus.

You know what that is? H.A. Cadbury was a professor of theology and Bible, Harvard from the 1930s, the 1950s,  and he loved getting undergraduate students who had never read the Bible, which of course  was quite a lot, even then. And he loved having, they'd all heard of Jesus, but just to have them read about Jesus, read  the accounts of what he was like, what he said, what he did, and just get what he called  their virgin reaction. And they're always shocked.

One of his students wrote this, you read about Jesus, who is he? What is he? Despite being absolutely approachable. This student wrote, Jesus, despite being absolutely approachable to the weakest and most broken  people, he is completely fearless before the proud and the corrupt. Despite being profoundly human and becoming weary and lonely and moved to joy and love  and anger, we never see him moody.

We never see him inconsistent. He is tender without being weak, strong without being harsh, humble without the slightest  lack of confidence. He has conviction without intolerance, enthusiasm without fanaticism, holiness without  Phariseism, passion without prejudice. This man alone never made a false step, never struck a jarring note. This is life at its highest.

And that is what spiritual gifts are supposed to produce. That's the point. When spiritual gifts are being used in the congregation, that's what results in the  lives of the people. And that is why, just the last thing I want to say about what spiritual gifts are, the  essence of a spiritual gift is the blessing of God, not the form of the action. And here's what I mean by that.

We live, I'll get back to those two. We live in New York City where what really matters is, I don't care about your accent,  they tell you here, I don't care where you're from, I don't even care how you address  what you look like, can you produce? Are you good enough? And so there's enormous emphasis on being talented and being gifted and being able to do  things. And what we have to recognize here is, the point of the spiritual gift is not the technical  perfection of this skill.

It's whether or not it produces Christ's likeness in people. It's the blessing of God, not the form of the action that really makes a spiritual gift  a spiritual gift. This is the reason why you will know, let me give you two examples, there are preachers  whose sermons aren't all that good if you analyze them, and yet always give you life-changing  experiences of God. Why? Because it's not the form of the action, it's the blessing of God.

It's the reason why there are spiritual leaders who do a great job, they get people together  and they move people out and they get things done and people follow them, even though they  don't do any of the things they tell you at the Harvard MBA school you should do. Why? I am not saying, if I'm training a preacher, I'm going to talk about technical. I'm going to talk about, yeah, here's how you outline, so people don't lose your train,  you know, what you're trying to say. But in the end, what makes a spiritual gift, a spiritual gift, is not the technical excellence  of what you're doing, it's whether or not God is blessing it.

And as we seek to recognize gifts in ourselves and in the people around us, especially  in a place like New York where technique is so important, over the important, let's  remember that. So that is what it is. Spiritual gifts are differing abilities given by the Holy Spirit to each believer, to  meet needs, but in such a way that it creates Christ's likeness in a community of people. Secondly, now, if that's true, there's your theology. What are some of the practical implications of that?

What's that going to do? What kind of church does that create? Okay? Let me give you four, four practical implications, all right? The first one is, it means there will not be any passive unemployed Christians in a church.

If this theology is embraced, there will not be any passive unemployed people in a church. And I want you to, for a minute, just to think about the implications of this theology. There's a place in Ephesians 2 where, verse 10, where it says,  Because we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works which God  prepared in advance for us to do. You have been crafted and your unique abilities mean that there's certain great things that  you are the, that God wants you to do or put it this way. Take your gifts, which will be everybody's gifts are different, and the fact that you're  gender, your ethnicity, your experience in life, you put all those things together.

But this means there are some people in this world that need to be reached and you are  the best person in the world to reach them because of who you are. There are some deeds that need to be done, that God wants to be done in this world. And because of who you are, you are the very best person to do them. To understand your gifts and to exercise your gifts is to find your meaning in life,  your mission in life. We have trouble embracing these in churches and I'll give you two different ways.

We have trouble embracing the theology in two different ways. In small churches here's the problem. In small churches there's so much to be done and only a few people to do it. And very often in small churches you find people doing a lot of things that they are just  not gifted to do. And as a result they're overworked and burned out.

And very often they're not getting things done very well because they're not gifted  to do it. And that's partly because very often small churches kind of ignore the theology of spiritual  gifts but I want you to know it's in us big churches, a big church like Redeemer that  has a bigger problem than the small churches and here's the reason why. Spiritual gifts are output, ministry is output, ministry is spending yourself, giving yourself  serving, doing for other people. Many many many many many people come to a large church like Redeemer because they're not  going to be asked to do anything. You come because I can get input, lots of input, high quality input and nobody's going to  ask me for output especially if you are careful where you sit.

But if you come to a church and get mainly input and virtually no output meaning you are  not making yourself accountable, getting involved in other people's lives, speaking the truth  and loving to their lives, using your unique gifts in order to see them build into Christ  likeness. See if you're coming and doing input and you're not doing output that is you're coming  and you're not really doing anything else but attending, you are violating the will of  the Holy Spirit for your life. To each is given a gift. You are God's workmanship there are certain things that you and you alone can do and if  you and God's providence are here then the rest of us need you or you wouldn't be here. That doesn't waste people, he doesn't waste assets like the rest of us do.

And therefore it's absolutely crucial if we embrace the theology of the spiritual gifts  that there be no unemployed or passive Christians. That's the first implication, second implication. It also means we ought to expect, and I already kind of hinted at this, we ought to expect  a certain amount of contention and conflict in the church because of spiritual gifts. We need to expect it to a certain degree. With Christmas just around the corner, we are inviting people to sign up for our Advent  devotional series which you can receive daily from November 30th to December 24th.

The daily meditations will help you take time to think about the meaning and joy that comes  from Christ's birth. Each day of Advent you'll receive a devotional with a meditation on a Bible passage  that focuses on why Jesus came into the world, to reconcile us to our Heavenly Father. We believe that during this short season this is a great tool to help you focus on the  hope, joy, peace, and love we have through Christ's birth. You can sign up by visiting gospelonlife.com slash Advent. Again, to sign up, go to gospelonlife.com slash Advent.

In addition to the daily emails, you'll also receive a video message each Sunday. The weekly video message starts each week of Advent with a meditation from Tim Keller,  followed by a brief discussion with Tim and Kathy talking about something they noticed  in the meditation is our prayer that through this Advent series you experience the hope  and joy that comes from Christ's birth and that it is a source of encouragement to you  this Advent season. Now, I've told you this probably illustration before but a perfect illustration for it. When I was a brand new minister in my very first church and a small town of Virginia  was 24 years old and I remember the very first three days or maybe the first four days  or five but three people came to see me almost one after the other. Of course, they always want to, you know, people in the church want to come by and make  sure the young preacher gets his head on straight and see things the way they see them.

So that I remember the first day the guy comes and one person came and can't remember actually  who was the first one. But the very first day the person said, you see the trailers outside. We were in a poor part of town and there were trailers, people living in trailer  trailers around the church. And so you see those trailers out there I said, yes, I said, you know why we're not reaching  those people? None of those people come to our church.

You know why we're not reaching those people? We don't have a heart for evangelism. Those people do not know Christ or they don't go to church anywhere. We don't have a heart for evangelism. We ought to be out there sharing our faith with those people.

But this church doesn't do that, okay, duly noted. Today or two somebody else came by and said a different person says, you see those trailers  out there. They said, yes, I do. And they said, you know why, what the problem with this church is? I said, no, what?

Those are poor people. Those are people that are of a different social class. These are people with lots of problems and we don't want them in our church. That's the problem. The art church doesn't care about the poor.

Art church doesn't want the kind of problems that will come if they come in. They've got a lot of personal problems, they've got economic problems and we don't want  that. We don't know how to deal with that. That's the problem with this church. A lack of mercy, a lack of care for the poor, okay, a couple days later, maybe the next  day, somebody else came in and said to me, you see those trailers out there?

I said, yes, I do. And so do you know what the problem with our church is? Now for some reason, though it's 24 accidently, I said something wise and I said, no, what? You know, I already took notes, I already know what the problem with the church is. This person said, our church is a lot of people have a lot of very good, they have good  will, they've got really great intentions and they want to reach out to a neighborhood  and we don't know how to do it.

This is a blue collar church and we don't have people who are not organized. They don't know how to set up a project and execute it. They don't know how to get things done. They don't know how to get from here to there. They can set goals and they never get to them.

And you know, all three people were right and all three people had gifts that enabled  them to see what was wrong, that the other people didn't had different gifts and they didn't  see the same things. They're all right. And to some degree, there was contention, there has to be contention. On the other hand, when you use the theology of spiritual gifts, that enables everybody  to realize, oh, the reason why I see things the way I do is partly because I've got a gift. And I need to meet that need and in some sense, I have to honor what other people say  that I see theology of spiritual gifts gets you to expect a certain amount of chaos in  a church because a church that understands the theology of spiritual gifts realize that  there will be ministry bubbling up all over the place, from all sorts of places.

There will always be a certain energy about a church. If you really embrace the theology of spiritual gifts, a lot of churches don't want that. They want to be totally controlled from the top. They want to say, you know, if we have a ministry idea, we people at the top will tell you about  it. You don't have to tell us.

We'll tell you. And that destroys, that's against the theology of spiritual gifts. So if you embrace the theology of spiritual gifts, not only will it not have a passive congregation,  but at the same time, you will also have a certain amount of contention, a certain amount  of conflict, and people will be arguing what should we be doing, what should the priorities  be. And that's right. Why?

Because that's the work of Holy Spirit. Three. Nevertheless, a theology of the Holy Spirit though creates a certain amount of contention. Should destroy jealousy and pride. Every organization I know, there's some jealousy and pride going on because some people  end up being leaders and some people not.

Some people end up with more power and influence and some people with less. And the people with less distrust the people with more. Or maybe even our jealous are resentful of the people with more. At least they're mistrustful. And the people with more sometimes lord it over other people and feel very proud of  their position.

But the whole idea of spiritual gifts is that God has made all the appointments. He has made the appointment. So let me give you a case study. What do you do, oh Presbyterians, since we're Presbyterian Church, when you elect elders? What are you doing when you elect elders?

You're only recognizing the gifts that God has given. You're only recognizing the people that God has appointed. That's all. And if you understand that, then A, if you end up getting elected, you will have absolutely  no pride about it. And B, if you are not elected, if you're one of the people that does the electing, then  you say, this is God's appointment, this isn't people lobbying and getting their people behind  it and all that.

So this is just God's appointment. That's what should happen. The weird thing about the theology of spiritual gifts is on the one hand. If you embrace it, it creates more contention in jostling in the church. On the other hand, it should actually be a kind of lubrication so that as we talk and  as we contend and as we push, there is a great deal of respect.

There's no jealousy, there's no resentment, there's no pride, there's no arrogance. And lastly, the last implication, though, of this theology of spiritual gifts is not  just is, in a sense, we're getting there, fruit, spiritual fruit has got to be the real  goal and spiritual gifts have got to be seen only as the means. The spiritual gifts are only a means of the end of the fullness of the stature of the  character of Jesus Christ. Fruit and gifts are not the same thing, never mistake gifts for fruit. What do I mean?

Spiritual fruit, while we talked about that fairly recently, did we not? This year, spiritual fruit are listed in Galatians chapter 5. Spiritual fruit are character qualities, love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,  humility, integrity, self-control, and every Christian should have all the fruit. But spiritual gifts were being told, no Christian is all the spiritual gifts, why? The difference is, fruit has to do with your being, gifts is doing, fruit is your character  who you are, gifts are skills and what you do, never, ever, ever mistake gifts for fruit.

And I not only have to say that everywhere in the world because the Bible says it, but  I have to say particularly in New York, for the reasons I've already told you. In New York, there's a tremendous amount of emphasis on getting things done, talent and  so on. And here's what can easily happen. If you get busy, if you get busy, if you start to do things, you start to serve people,  you start to volunteer and people are helped by you. People love what you're doing and it doesn't even have to be through the church.

If you're always putting yourself out for people, so you're all these people depending  on you. You know what you can start to do? You can start to say, God is with me. Look at all the people that I'm helping. Look at all the people whose lives I'm touching.

God is with me. What are you doing? You're violating the theology of spiritual gifts. Gifts is not fruit. You're looking, let me tell you what your fruit is.

Do you find yourself getting happier and happier, no matter what your circumstances? More, more confident, even when things are bad, not always up and down emotionally. That's fruit. Do you find yourself getting humbler and humbler and caring less and less about criticism  what people are saying about you? Because you're so absolutely secure in God.

That's fruit. Do you find your prayer life being rich and you sense God's presence in His love and  that's the reason why you're not as emotionally up and down and you're able to take criticism  better and you're able to handle bad circumstance. That's fruit, but here's what goes on when you can be empty inside and you're really  not doing well with God and you're not growing in fruit yet you get out there and you help  people and you talk to people and you encourage people where you teach people and they say,  oh, you're helping me so much and then you start to feel good about yourself. Don't you dare do that. You know what you're doing?

You know what you're doing. Charles Spurgeon, a great Baptist preacher some years ago, many years ago now wrote a book  for his students, these are other ministry students and I'll never forget reading the  line. He said, don't go into the ministry to save your soul and I remember thinking, what idiot  would go into the ministry if he wasn't already saved, you know, being an idiot myself  at the time. And now I know what he meant. When you use spiritual gifts as a replacement for spiritual fruit, when you get busy as  a way of covering up your own unhappiness and emptiness on the inside and your own lack  of a decent relationship with God, you can be big stuff in a church, but ultimately it's  deadly, you know why?

Because gifts without fruit is like a tire without air. Gifts without fruit, you know, when your tire is losing air, if you're moving along, moving  along, it sort of stays up for a while and then when you come to a stoplight and there  have been plenty of people whose lives were going down the drain spiritually. And yet because they were very active, many ministers, of course, you know that. They're very famous. They do a whole lot of good and they're actually changing a lot of people's lives.

Why? Because their gifts are working. Inside, there are all kinds of problems, difficulties, you know, evil sin, you know, emptiness. They're covering it up and they look outside and they say look at that, they're the high  profile. They're mistaken gets for fruit, but anybody can do it and people are doing it all the  time.

You must not do that. The point is Christ's likeness in you, the point of Christ's likeness in those other people. And therefore, never mistake gifts for fruit. Fruit is the center, fruit is the end, you know, gifts are only the means. That's the theology of Holy Spirit and what a different kind of church it's going to be  if we embrace it.

Now that brings us to our last point and here's what we see, we're on the verge of needing  this last point. How can we use our spiritual gifts rightly? I like to show you, I just did show you, that there's all kinds of ways in which the  exercise of spiritual gifts is problematic. It can lead to power struggles and jealousy. In some case, it leads to passivity because people just don't embrace the theology at all.

It can lead to burnout because people are working really so hard to essentially fill up  an emptiness in their own lives instead of going to God whether they're using their ministry  and they're using their helping of other people in this way. There's all kinds of problems around spiritual gifts. How can we use them rightly? And the answer is one word. You see it here and you certainly see it in 1 Corinthians when Paul talks about it.

It's the word love. Notice, verse 15 and 16, the whole point is, speaking the truth in love, we'll build ourselves  up into the fullness of Christ. When every part of the body is doing its thing rightly, the body builds itself up in love  over and over, Paul never gets the spiritual gifts without talking about love. And of course, most famously in 1 Corinthians 12 and 14, he's talking about spiritual gifts  and smack in the middle of verse 13, chapter 13, Paul gives the famous passage on love. Why?

Because Paul says, over and over, if you're passive and not using your gifts, that's  just a lack of love, you're being selfish. If you're burnout and overworked because you're ministering to everybody and helping  everybody because out of an inner emptiness, it's because of a lack of love you don't really  have God's love in your life. If you're swaggering and powerful, it's a lack of love. If you're jealous and envious of somebody who's got the power, that's a lack of love. You need love, or the spiritual gifts are going to kill us, or the lack of the spiritual  gifts are going to kill us.

How do you get that love? You have to go to the part of the passage, which was the one part when it was read to you  that you didn't understand at all. That's the key. As it so often is, what is that? It's the beginning of the passage.

To each one of us grace has been given as Christ a portion of it. Whenever I've read this over the years, I read verse 7, then I get down to verse 11, which  makes sense again, and you keep reading. What is all this? This is why it says, when he ascended on high, he led captives in his train, he gave gifts  to men. What does he ascended?

He also descended to the lower earthly regions. He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens in order to fill  the whole universe. What that is, follow me and only take about 120 seconds, and you'll start to see the wonder  of what Paul is saying. In ancient times, if the king was in his city, and there was an enemy coming to invade  and enslave everyone, the king would go out to fight the enemy. If he won, if he delivered his people from oppression and captivity, he would return triumphantly,  and he would go back to his throne, he would ascend his throne, and sit down so his presence  was again in the midst of the people, and he would give gifts.

That is, he would take the riches that he'd won in his conquest, which would enrich the  entire city. Now in Psalm 68 verse 18, which is what Paul is quoting here, the Psalmist looks at a  particular incident, and reads it through that basic grid of what conquering kings would  do. They'd go out, save the people from oppression, ascend back in, bring in their presence,  and then give gifts. And they're looking at something that happened. The Psalmist was looking at the fact that David the king brought the ark of the covenant,  which represented the Shakana presence of God in the Jerusalem, ascended Mount Zion, which  is the place where in the Jerusalem where the Tabernacle was, and brought the ark of  the covenant into the Holy of Holies.

And the reason why this whole Psalm is celebrating that is in a way it's realizing God is the  ultimate king. And this is the end, it's the word of the Exodus, because God had brought the people out  of slavery, out of captivity. He defeated Egypt, and he brought them out of captivity. And now, finally, God was ascending his throne. And he was now present in the midst of his people in the Tabernacle.

And they were the fruits of that triumph, was milk and honey of the Promised Land. And so that's what the Psalmist is talking about, but Jesus, but listen, Paul always reads  the Old Testament, like you and I ought to read the Old Testament. He never can not, he can never stop thinking about Jesus. And he reads that Psalm about David bringing the ark, and the presence of God ascending  and gifts, and the triumph of God over oppression, and suddenly Paul realizes God was not done. When that was over, God was not done.

God the King had a bigger enemy to defeat sin and death, and God the King had a way of dwelling  in the midst of his people better than the ark in the Tabernacle. And God had even better spiritual gifts to give. And you know what happened? Here's how God did it. Jesus Christ descended.

That's the key. He descended. He descended from heaven to earth. He descended from honor and glory, to abuse and rejection, and to torture and death. He was humiliated.

He was destroyed. He descended. Why? When he went to the cross, you know what he was doing? He was defeating the Old Testament Egypt, sin and death, and he was getting pardoned for  our sins.

So not just the box, the ark of the covenant was a box which represented the presence of  God. So the Holy Spirit could actually come into our lives because our sins are atone for. So the presence of God could come into our midst, and we could get the ultimate spiritual  gifts which is the power of the Holy Spirit himself to bring people to a relationship  with God. That is love. David brought the ark of the covenant.

He brought the presence of God to the people at the risk of his life, but Jesus Christ  did it at the cost of his life. Jesus descended. He lost everything. There's love. And there's the love that you need.

Unless you are melted by and shaped by, and profoundly changed by, a knowledge of that  love. He did all that for you. All that for you. You are not able to really minister your spiritual gifts properly. But see that and you can.

So in the end, do you want to exercise your spiritual gifts rightly? Number one, you've got to have the Holy Spirit. You've got to be a Christian. You have to believe the gospel. You can't use your spiritual gifts if you don't have the Spirit.

Okay. Number two, how do I identify my spiritual gifts? Not as hard as you think. Try a lot of different kinds of ministries and then consult your own heart and consult  the church, consult the people around you. But thirdly, look at Jesus.

Look at this guy. Look at this perfect man in the gospels. See something so beautiful. See his character. See his holiness and yet his love.

See his forgiveness and yet his strength and boldness. See that and say, I don't want to just be happy anymore. I want to be like him. And I want all the people that I love around me to be like him. And now use your spiritual gifts.

Now it's safe. Let us pray. Thank you, Father, for giving us this great theology of spiritual gifts. And we pray that we here in New York City would embrace it. So we've been either passive and are proud.

So we would be constantly recognizing the wonderful chaos of spiritual gifts, but at the same  time, the knowledge that you have appointed, what you've appointed, keeps us, keeps our  pride down, makes us humble, makes us able to listen to other people. Most of all, oh Lord, we want to use our gifts to bear spiritual fruit in people's lives. And we ask that you would help us never forget that. Never forget our eyes filled with, we don't want to be star-eyed about gifts. What we really want is we want to see Christ's likeness grow in our own hearts and the hearts  of the people around us.

Make us a church in which that is what happens. We pray in Jesus' name, amen.

今天蒂姆·凯勒要探讨圣灵如何呼召我们信主，如何将我们联合在一起，如何用恩赐装备我们，以及如何塑造我们更像基督。我们今天早上的经文读经是以弗所书第4章第7到16节。我们各人蒙恩，都是照基督所量给各人的恩赐。所以经上说，他升上高天的时候，掳掠了仇敌，将各样的恩赐赏给人。既说升上，岂不是先降在地下吗？

那降下的，就是远升诸天之上要充满万有的。他所赐的有使徒，有先知，有传福音的，有牧师和教师。为要成全圣徒，各尽其职，建立基督的身体。直等到我们众人在真道上同归于一，认识神的儿子，得以长大成人，满有基督长成的身量。使我们不再作小孩子，中了人的诡计，和欺骗的法术，被一切异教之风摇动，飘来飘去，就随从各样的异端。惟用爱心说诚实话，凡事长进，连于元首基督。全身都靠他联络得合式，百节各按各职，照着各体的功用，彼此相助，便叫身体渐渐增长，在爱中建立自己。

这是主的道。在我们关于圣灵的系列讲道中，我们现在来到圣经所说的圣灵恩赐这个主题。你知道，我在基督教事工中即将有40年了，我知道看我的样子你可能看不出来，但确实快40年了。我见过教会在属灵恩赐这个主题上摆到如此极端的位置。从对它们的痴迷关注到完全忽视它们，我认为我们将要看到，没有什么比理解圣经在这里给我们的——一套属灵恩赐的神学——更实用的了，它能帮助我们理解一个基督教会在实地上实际应该是什么样子。所以如果我们能避免极端，我们将学到很多关于我们应该是什么样子。如果这是你的教会，这个教会应该是什么样子，如果你来自其他教会，那么你那里的教会应该是什么样子。

让我们向经文提三个问题。什么是属灵恩赐？其次，属灵恩赐神学的实际含义是什么？对教会生活有什么影响？第三，我们如何正确使用属灵恩赐？

首先，它们是什么？让我给你一个定义，这是多年思考圣经所说的内容后得出的。定义是：属灵恩赐是圣灵赐给每位信徒的不同能力，用来满足需要，以创造一个成长为耶稣基督完全品格的群体。让我为你把这个分成三部分。首先，属灵恩赐是满足需要的能力。

圣经中有五个属灵恩赐的清单。罗马书12章有一个，哥林多前书12章有两个，以弗所书4章有这一个，彼得前书4章有一个，每一个清单实际上都相当不同。很明显，每一个都不是详尽无遗的，而是举例说明的，即使你把它们全部放在一起，我们也没有列出所有的恩赐。但如果你读完它们，你会看到有一些恩赐群组。有些恩赐是传达真理的能力，如传福音、教导。

有些恩赐是承担重担的能力，所以你有鼓励、怜悯、服务和帮助的恩赐。有些恩赐是给予方向的恩赐，所以你有领导力、行政管理和智慧，智慧是一种辅导恩赐，一种给个人指引的方式。但现在看，没有任何人类需要——属灵的、身体的、心理的、关系的——是没有某种属灵恩赐可以满足的。属灵恩赐就是满足这些需要的能力。看，有些属灵恩赐在我们受伤时医治我们，有些属灵恩赐在我们沮丧时鼓励我们。

有些属灵恩赐在我们落后时挑战我们，或在我们走偏时纠正我们，或在我们被拒绝时爱我们，或只是在我们无知时告知我们。没有任何人类需要是没有某种属灵恩赐可以满足的。所以属灵恩赐是满足需要的能力。其次，这些属灵恩赐是不同的，但却赐给每一位信徒。看，它说，基督已经给每个人一份圣灵的能力来满足需要。

尽管我们在基督里从根本上都是一体的，但属灵恩赐创造了巨大的多样性，不仅如我们将看到的那样。属灵恩赐不仅使基督徒在他们所看到的、他们所共鸣的以及他们如何看待世界方面因人而异，而且个别基督徒之间差异极大，恩赐也使教会彼此不同。教会之间非常不同，因为这些教会中的恩赐组合可能与街对面教会的恩赐组合非常不同。因此，这是基督教会中存在这种惊人多样性的原因之一。这确实是人们说为什么基督教会不更...为什么它如此不同？为什么有这么多教派？这么多教会。为什么？为什么？

原因之一就是这个。另一个原因是罪。原因之一就是这个。原因之一就是这个，但即使它使它不同，每个信徒，它并没有说给某些信徒，给超级信徒，给某些信徒，你得到属灵恩赐是每个人。当它说给我们每一个人时，"我们"是指基督徒，保罗不只是说我们牧师或类似的东西，是给每一个。

所以每个人都得到一份。耶稣拥有所有的事工能力——传达真理、承担重担、给予方向。他拥有全部。我们得到他事工能力的一部分来满足需要，但每个人都得到一份，而且只是一部分。现在，第三，这实际上是我今天要强调两三次的最重要的事情。

属灵恩赐的目标是什么？事工的目标是什么？保罗的句子非常长，它们甚至比英文中看起来的还要长，因为英文翻译者通常会把他的句子分成几个句子，以使其更清楚一些。有时候很难判断所有这些的最终目标是什么。你让每个人都得到一个恩赐，然后你有一些更突出的恩赐，如牧师、教师、传福音的、先知，然后做什么？

装备人从事服务工作，所以每个人都在做他们的工作，但最终目标是什么？建立身体，直到我们在真道上同归于一，认识神的儿子，得以长大成人，满有基督长成的身量。现在，这话说起来很长，但这就是所有事工的目的。教会中的事工，行使属灵恩赐不只是为了以某种笼统的方式让人快乐。首先，它是为了形成我们成为一个身体。

属灵恩赐使我们成为一个身体。所以我经常喜欢说，聚合和会众之间有区别。聚合就像一袋弹珠。那里有一千个弹珠在一个袋子里，它们都彼此相邻，但它们在滑动，它们没有任何特定的模式。它们彼此之间没有任何特定的关系，它们都在同一个袋子里。

有些教会是聚合，但会众是一个身体，因为每个恩赐使你与其他恩赐不同，然而你的恩赐在教会中是绝对必要的。因此，圣灵使我们成为一个身体，所以你有你的头、你的手、你的脚和你的肘部，这是一个比喻，但这意味着每个人不仅不同，不像弹珠，而且我们都彼此密切相关。所以圣灵，特别是属灵恩赐，使我们成为一个身体，但所有这些事工的整个目的是在彼此身上创造基督的样式。你不只是笼统地鼓励，你不只是笼统地教导，你不只是笼统地帮助。当属灵恩赐被正确行使时，接受事工的人的结果是成长为基督的样式，成长为耶稣的样式。

你知道那是什么吗？H.A.卡德伯里是哈佛大学神学和圣经教授，从1930年代到1950年代，他喜欢让那些从未读过圣经的本科生，当然那时已经有很多了。他喜欢让他们，他们都听说过耶稣，但只是让他们读关于耶稣的内容，读关于他是什么样的、他说了什么、他做了什么的记载，只是得到他所说的他们的原始反应。他们总是很震惊。

他的一个学生写道，你读到耶稣，他是谁？他是什么？尽管对最软弱和最破碎的人来说是绝对平易近人的。这个学生写道，耶稣，尽管对最软弱和最破碎的人来说绝对平易近人，但他在骄傲和腐败的人面前完全无惧。尽管深深地人性化，会疲惫、孤独，会被感动到喜乐、爱和愤怒，但我们从未见过他情绪化。

我们从未见过他前后不一。他温柔但不软弱，坚强但不严厉，谦卑但丝毫不缺乏自信。他有信念但不偏狭，热情但不狂热，圣洁但不法利赛，热情但不偏见。唯独这个人从未走错一步，从未奏出不和谐的音符。这是生命的最高境界。

这就是属灵恩赐应该产生的。这就是重点。当属灵恩赐在会众中被使用时，这就是在人们生命中产生的结果。这就是为什么，关于属灵恩赐是什么，我想说的最后一件事是，属灵恩赐的本质是神的祝福，而不是行动的形式。我的意思是这样的。

我们生活，我会回到这两点。我们生活在纽约市，在这里真正重要的是，他们告诉你，我不在乎你的口音，我不在乎你来自哪里，我甚至不在乎你如何穿着，你长什么样，你能产出吗？你够好吗？所以这里非常强调有才华、有恩赐和能够做事。我们必须认识到的是，属灵恩赐的重点不是这项技能的技术完美。

而是它是否在人们身上产生基督的样式。是神的祝福，而不是行动的形式，才真正使属灵恩赐成为属灵恩赐。这就是为什么你会知道，让我给你两个例子，有些传道人，如果你分析他们的讲道，他们的讲道并不是那么好，但总是给你改变生命的神的经历。为什么？因为不是行动的形式，而是神的祝福。

这就是为什么有些属灵领袖做得很好，他们把人聚集在一起，他们让人行动起来，他们把事情做成，人们跟随他们，尽管他们没有做哈佛商学院告诉你应该做的任何事情。为什么？我不是说，如果我在培训一个传道人，我会谈论技术。我会说，是的，这是你如何列提纲，这样人们就不会失去你的思路，你知道，你试图说什么。但归根结底，使属灵恩赐成为属灵恩赐的，不是你所做的技术卓越，而是神是否祝福它。

当我们试图在自己和周围的人身上认识恩赐时，特别是在像纽约这样技术如此重要、过分重要的地方，让我们记住这一点。所以这就是它是什么。属灵恩赐是圣灵赐给每位信徒的不同能力，用来满足需要，但以这样一种方式，它在一群人中创造基督的样式。其次，现在，如果这是真的，这就是你的神学。其中一些实际含义是什么？

这会做什么？这会创造什么样的教会？好吗？让我给你四个，四个实际含义，好吗？第一个是，这意味着在教会中不会有任何被动的失业基督徒。

如果这个神学被接受，教会中就不会有任何被动的失业者。我想让你，花一分钟，思考一下这个神学的含义。以弗所书2章10节有一处说，我们原是他的工作，在基督耶稣里造成的，为要叫我们行善，就是神所预备叫我们行的。你被精心制作，你独特的能力意味着有某些伟大的事情，你是，神要你做的，或者这样说。拿你的恩赐，每个人的恩赐都是不同的，还有你是性别、你的种族、你的生活经历这个事实，你把所有这些东西放在一起。

但这意味着世界上有些人需要被接触，而你是世界上最适合接触他们的人，因为你是谁。有些事需要完成，神希望在这个世界上完成。因为你是谁，你是做这些事的最佳人选。理解你的恩赐并行使你的恩赐就是找到你生命的意义，你生命的使命。我们在教会中很难接受这些，我会给你两种不同的方式。

我们以两种不同的方式难以接受这个神学。在小教会中问题是这样的。在小教会中有太多事情要做，只有少数人去做。在小教会中，你经常发现人们在做很多他们根本没有恩赐去做的事情。结果他们过度劳累、精疲力竭。

而且很多时候他们做得不太好，因为他们没有恩赐去做。这部分是因为小教会经常忽视属灵恩赐的神学，但我想让你知道，我们这样的大教会，像救赎主这样的大教会，比小教会有更大的问题，原因如下。属灵恩赐是输出，事工是输出，事工是花费自己，为他人付出、服务、做事。很多很多很多很多人来到像救赎主这样的大教会，因为他们不会被要求做任何事。你来是因为我可以得到输入，大量的输入，高质量的输入，没有人会要求我输出，特别是如果你小心选择坐的位置。

但如果你来到一个教会主要得到输入而几乎没有输出，意思是你没有让自己负责，没有参与到其他人的生活中，没有用爱心向他们的生活说真话，没有使用你独特的恩赐来看到他们建造成基督的样式。看，如果你来了只是输入，而你除了参加之外没有真正做任何其他事情，你就是违反了圣灵对你生命的旨意。每个人都得到一个恩赐。你是神的工作，有某些事情只有你能做，如果你在神的护理中在这里，那么我们其他人就需要你，否则你就不会在这里。他不会浪费人，他不会像我们其他人那样浪费资产。

因此，如果我们接受属灵恩赐的神学，没有失业或被动的基督徒是绝对关键的。这是第一个含义，第二个含义。这也意味着我们应该期待，我已经暗示过这一点，我们应该期待教会中因为属灵恩赐而有一定程度的争论和冲突。我们需要在一定程度上期待它。圣诞节即将来临，我们邀请人们注册我们的将临期灵修系列，你可以从11月30日到12月24日每天收到。

每日默想将帮助你花时间思考基督降生所带来的意义和喜乐。将临期的每一天，你都会收到一份灵修，其中有对圣经段落的默想，重点关注耶稣为什么来到世界，使我们与天父和好。我们相信在这个短暂的季节，这是一个很好的工具，帮助你专注于我们通过基督降生所拥有的盼望、喜乐、平安和爱。你可以访问gospelonlife.com/Advent注册。再次提醒，要注册，请访问gospelonlife.com/Advent。

除了每日电子邮件，你还将在每个星期天收到一个视频信息。每周的视频信息以蒂姆·凯勒的默想开始将临期的每一周，然后是蒂姆和凯西的简短讨论，谈论他们在默想中注意到的一些东西，这是我们的祷告，通过这个将临期系列，你能体验到从基督降生而来的盼望和喜乐，愿它在这个将临期成为你的鼓励源泉。现在，我可能以前告诉过你这个例子，但这是一个完美的例子。当我在我的第一个教会做一个全新的牧师时，在弗吉尼亚的一个小镇，我24岁，我记得在最初的三天，也许是前四天或五天，但有三个人几乎一个接一个地来看我。当然，他们总是想，你知道，教会里的人想过来确保年轻的传道人把头脑摆正，按照他们的方式看事情。

所以我记得第一天有人来，一个人来了，实际上记不清谁是第一个了。但就在第一天，那个人说，你看到外面的拖车了吗？我们在城镇的一个贫困地区，教会周围有拖车，人们住在拖车里。所以你看到那些拖车了吗？我说，是的，我说，你知道为什么我们没有接触到那些人吗？那些人中没有一个来我们教会。

你知道为什么我们没有接触到那些人吗？我们没有传福音的心。那些人不认识基督，或者他们根本不去任何教会。我们没有传福音的心。我们应该去那里与那些人分享我们的信仰。

但这个教会不这样做，好的，已记下。今天或两天后，另一个人过来了，另一个人说，你看到外面那些拖车了吗？他们说，是的，我看到了。他们说，你知道，这个教会的问题是什么吗？我说，不知道，是什么？

那些是穷人。那些是不同社会阶层的人。这些是有很多问题的人，我们不想让他们进入我们的教会。这就是问题。艺术教会不关心穷人。

艺术教会不想要如果他们进来会带来的那种问题。他们有很多个人问题，他们有经济问题，我们不想要那个。我们不知道如何处理那个。这就是这个教会的问题。缺乏怜悯，缺乏对穷人的关心，好的，几天后，也许是第二天，又有人进来对我说，你看到外面那些拖车了吗？

我说，是的，我看到了。那么你知道我们教会的问题是什么吗？现在由于某种原因，虽然我24岁，偶然地，我说了一些明智的话，我说，不知道，是什么？你知道，我已经做了笔记，我已经知道教会的问题是什么了。这个人说，我们教会有很多人有很好的，他们有良好的意愿，他们有非常好的意图，他们想接触邻里，我们不知道如何做到这一点。

这是一个蓝领教会，我们没有组织起来的人。他们不知道如何建立一个项目并执行它。他们不知道如何把事情做成。他们不知道如何从这里到那里。他们可以设定目标，但他们永远无法达到目标。

你知道，这三个人都是对的，这三个人都有恩赐，使他们能够看到错误的地方，而其他有不同恩赐的人看不到同样的事情。他们都是对的。在某种程度上，存在争论，必须有争论。另一方面，当你使用属灵恩赐的神学时，它使每个人都能意识到，哦，我之所以这样看事情，部分是因为我有一个恩赐。我需要满足那个需要，从某种意义上说，我必须尊重其他人所说的，我看到属灵恩赐的神学让你期待教会中有一定程度的混乱，因为一个理解属灵恩赐神学的教会意识到，事工会从各个地方、从各种地方涌现出来。

教会总会有一定的活力。如果你真正接受属灵恩赐的神学，很多教会不想要那样。他们想完全从上层控制。他们想说，你知道，如果我们有一个事工想法，我们高层的人会告诉你。你不必告诉我们。

我们会告诉你。这破坏了，这违背了属灵恩赐的神学。所以如果你接受属灵恩赐的神学，不仅不会有被动的会众，而且同时，你也会有一定程度的争论，一定程度的冲突，人们会争论我们应该做什么，优先事项应该是什么。这是对的。为什么？

因为那是圣灵的工作。第三。然而，圣灵的神学虽然创造了一定程度的争论。应该消除嫉妒和骄傲。我知道的每个组织，都有一些嫉妒和骄傲在发生，因为有些人最终成为领导者，有些人不是。

有些人最终拥有更多的权力和影响力，有些人较少。拥有较少的人不信任拥有更多的人。或者甚至可能是嫉妒或怨恨拥有更多的人。至少他们是不信任的。拥有更多的人有时会对其他人发号施令，对自己的地位感到非常自豪。

但属灵恩赐的整个理念是神做了所有的任命。他做了任命。所以让我给你一个案例研究。你怎么做，哦，长老会，既然我们是长老会教会，当你选举长老时？当你选举长老时你在做什么？

你只是在认可神所赐的恩赐。你只是在认可神所任命的人。就这样。如果你明白这一点，那么A，如果你最终被选上，你绝对不会为此感到骄傲。B，如果你没有被选上，如果你是选举人之一，那么你说，这是神的任命，这不是人们游说并让他们的人支持它之类的。

所以这只是神的任命。这应该发生。属灵恩赐神学的奇怪之处在于一方面。如果你接受它，它会在教会中创造更多的争论和推搡。另一方面，它实际上应该是一种润滑剂，这样当我们交谈、争论和推动时，会有很大的尊重。

没有嫉妒,没有怨恨,没有骄傲,没有傲慢。最后，最后一个含义，虽然，这个属灵恩赐神学的最后一个含义不仅是，在某种意义上，我们正在到达那里，果子，属灵的果子必须是真正的目标，属灵恩赐必须只被视为手段。属灵恩赐只是达到耶稣基督品格的完全身量这一目的的手段。果子和恩赐不是同一回事，永远不要把恩赐误认为果子。我是什么意思？

属灵的果子，我们最近谈到过，不是吗？今年，属灵的果子在加拉太书第5章中列出。属灵的果子是品格品质，爱、喜乐、和平、忍耐、恩慈、良善、谦卑、正直、自制，每个基督徒都应该有所有的果子。但我们被告知属灵恩赐，没有基督徒拥有所有的属灵恩赐，为什么？区别在于，果子关乎你的存在，恩赐是行动，果子是你的品格，你是谁，恩赐是技能和你所做的，永远，永远，永远不要把恩赐误认为果子。

我不仅要在世界各地说这一点，因为圣经这样说，而且我必须特别在纽约说，因为我已经告诉你的原因。在纽约，非常强调把事情做成，才华等等。这就是容易发生的事情。如果你变得忙碌，如果你变得忙碌，如果你开始做事情，你开始服务人，你开始做志愿者，人们因你而得帮助。人们喜欢你所做的，甚至不必通过教会。

如果你总是为人们付出自己，所以你所有这些人都依赖你。你知道你可以开始做什么吗？你可以开始说，神与我同在。看看我帮助的所有人。看看所有生命被我触摸的人。

神与我同在。你在做什么？你在违反属灵恩赐的神学。恩赐不是果子。你在看，让我告诉你什么是你的果子。

你发现自己变得越来越快乐吗，无论你的环境如何？更，更自信，即使事情不好，不总是在情绪上起伏不定。那是果子。你发现自己变得越来越谦卑吗，越来越不在乎批评，人们对你说什么？因为你在神里面如此绝对安全。

那是果子。你发现你的祷告生活丰富吗，你感受到神的同在在他的爱中，这就是为什么你在情绪上不那么起伏不定，你能够更好地接受批评，你能够应对不好的环境。那是果子，但当你内心空虚，你与神的关系真的不太好，你在果子上没有成长，但你出去帮助人，你与人交谈，你鼓励人，你教导人，他们说，哦，你帮了我很多忙，然后你开始对自己感觉良好。你不敢那样做。你知道你在做什么吗？

你知道你在做什么。查尔斯·司布真，一位伟大的浸信会传道人，多年前，现在已经很多年了，为他的学生写了一本书，这些是其他事工学生，我永远不会忘记读到这句话。他说，不要进入事工来拯救你的灵魂，我记得当时想，什么白痴会在还没有得救的情况下进入事工，你知道，当时我自己就是个白痴。现在我知道他的意思了。当你使用属灵恩赐作为属灵果子的替代品时，当你忙碌作为掩盖你内心的不快乐和空虚以及你与神缺乏良好关系的方式时，你可以在教会中成为大人物，但最终这是致命的，你知道为什么吗？

因为没有果子的恩赐就像没有空气的轮胎。没有果子的恩赐，你知道，当你的轮胎漏气时，如果你一直在移动，移动，它会暂时保持充气，然后当你遇到红灯时，有很多人的生命在属灵上正在走下坡路。但因为他们非常活跃，许多牧师，当然，你知道的。他们非常有名。他们做了很多好事，他们实际上在改变很多人的生命。

为什么？因为他们的恩赐在起作用。内心，有各种各样的问题、困难，你知道，邪恶的罪，你知道，空虚。他们在掩盖它，他们看外面，他们说看那个，他们是高调的。他们把恩赐误认为果子，但任何人都可以这样做，人们一直在这样做。

你不能那样做。重点是你里面的基督的样式，重点是那些其他人身上的基督的样式。因此，永远不要把恩赐误认为果子。果子是中心，果子是目的，你知道，恩赐只是手段。这就是圣灵的神学，如果我们接受它，将会是一个多么不同的教会。

现在这把我们带到了最后一点，这就是我们所看到的，我们正处于需要这最后一点的边缘。我们如何正确使用我们的属灵恩赐？我想给你看，我刚刚给你看了，属灵恩赐的行使在很多方面都是有问题的。它可能导致权力斗争和嫉妒。在某些情况下，它导致被动，因为人们根本不接受神学。

它可能导致精疲力竭，因为人们真的如此努力地工作，本质上是为了填补他们自己生命中的空虚，而不是去到神那里，他们在使用他们的事工，他们在以这种方式使用他们对其他人的帮助。围绕属灵恩赐有各种各样的问题。我们如何正确使用它们？答案是一个词。你在这里看到它，在保罗谈论它时你当然在哥林多前书中看到它。

这个词是爱。注意，第15和16节，重点是，用爱心说诚实话，我们将建造自己进入基督的完全。当身体的每个部分都正确地做它的事情时，身体在爱中建造自己，一次又一次，保罗从不谈论属灵恩赐而不谈论爱。当然，最著名的是在哥林多前书12章和14章中，他在谈论属灵恩赐，在第13节的正中间，第13章，保罗给出了关于爱的著名段落。为什么？

因为保罗一次又一次地说，如果你被动而不使用你的恩赐，那只是缺乏爱，你在自私。如果你精疲力竭、过度劳累，因为你在服事每个人、帮助每个人，因为出于内心的空虚，那是因为缺乏爱，你的生命中真的没有神的爱。如果你趾高气扬、强势，那是缺乏爱。如果你嫉妒、羡慕拥有权力的人，那是缺乏爱。你需要爱，否则属灵恩赐会杀死我们，或者缺乏属灵恩赐会杀死我们。

你如何得到那种爱？你必须去到段落的那部分，这是读给你听时你根本不理解的那部分。这是关键。往往就是这样，那是什么？是段落的开头。

我们各人蒙恩，都是照基督所量给各人的恩赐。每当我多年来读到这里时，我读第7节，然后我到达第11节，那又开始有意义了，你继续读。这都是什么？这就是为什么它说，他升上高天的时候，掳掠了仇敌，将各样的恩赐赏给人。既说升上是什么意思？

他也降在地下吗？那降下的，就是远升诸天之上要充满万有的。这是什么，跟着我，只需要大约120秒，你就会开始看到保罗所说的奇妙之处。在古代，如果国王在他的城里，有敌人来入侵并奴役所有人，国王会出去与敌人战斗。如果他赢了，如果他把他的人民从压迫和囚禁中解救出来，他会凯旋而归，他会回到他的宝座，他会升上他的宝座，坐下，这样他的同在再次在人民中间，他会给予恩赐。

也就是说，他会拿出他在征服中赢得的财富，这会使整个城市富裕。现在在诗篇68篇第18节，这是保罗在这里引用的，诗人看着一个特定的事件，通过征服的国王会做的基本框架来解读它。他们会出去，把人民从压迫中拯救出来，升上去，带来他们的同在，然后给予恩赐。他们在看发生的事情。诗人在看大卫王把约柜带到耶路撒冷，代表神的示剑那同在，升上锡安山，这是耶路撒冷的会幕所在的地方，把约柜带到至圣所。

这整首诗篇庆祝这一点的原因是，在某种程度上它意识到神是最终的国王。这是结局，这是出埃及的话语，因为神把人民从奴役中带出来，从囚禁中带出来。他击败了埃及，他把他们从囚禁中带出来。现在，最后，神正在升上他的宝座。他现在在会幕中在他的人民中间同在。

那胜利的果实，是应许之地的牛奶和蜂蜜。所以这就是诗人在谈论的，但耶稣，但听着，保罗总是读旧约，就像你和我应该读旧约一样。他永远不能，他永远不能停止思考耶稣。他读那首关于大卫带约柜的诗篇，神的同在升上和恩赐，神对压迫的胜利，突然保罗意识到神还没有完成。当那结束时，神还没有完成。

神这位国王有一个更大的敌人要击败——罪和死亡，神这位国王有一种更好的方式住在他的人民中间，比会幕中的约柜更好。神有更好的属灵恩赐要给。你知道发生了什么吗？这就是神如何做到的。耶稣基督降下。

这是关键。他降下。他从天上降到地上。他从荣耀和尊荣降到虐待和拒绝，降到酷刑和死亡。他被羞辱。

他被摧毁。他降下。为什么？当他上十字架时，你知道他在做什么吗？他在击败旧约的埃及，罪和死亡，他在为我们的罪得赦免。

所以不只是那个盒子，约柜是一个代表神同在的盒子。所以圣灵实际上可以进入我们的生命，因为我们的罪得到赎罪。所以神的同在可以进入我们中间，我们可以得到最终的属灵恩赐，就是圣灵自己的能力，带领人与神建立关系。那就是爱。大卫带来了约柜。

他冒着生命危险把神的同在带给人民，但耶稣基督是以他生命的代价做到的。耶稣降下。他失去了一切。那就是爱。那就是你需要的爱。

除非你被融化、被塑造、被深刻改变，通过对那种爱的认识。他为你做了所有这一切。一切都是为了你。你无法真正正确地服事你的属灵恩赐。但看到那个，你就可以。

所以最后，你想正确地行使你的属灵恩赐吗？第一，你必须有圣灵。你必须是基督徒。你必须相信福音。如果你没有圣灵，你就不能使用你的属灵恩赐。

好。第二，我如何识别我的属灵恩赐？没有你想的那么难。尝试很多不同种类的事工，然后咨询你自己的心和咨询教会，咨询你周围的人。但第三，看耶稣。

看这个人。看福音书中这个完美的人。看到如此美丽的东西。看他的品格。看他的圣洁和他的爱。

看他的宽恕和他的力量和勇敢。看到那个并说，我不只是想快乐了。我想像他。我想让我周围所有我爱的人都像他。现在使用你的属灵恩赐。

现在这是安全的。让我们祷告。天父，感谢你给我们这伟大的属灵恩赐神学。我们祈求我们这里在纽约市会接受它。所以我们一直被动或骄傲。

所以我们会不断认识到属灵恩赐的美妙混乱，但同时，你所任命的知识，你所任命的，让我们保持，让我们的骄傲降下，使我们谦卑，使我们能够倾听其他人。最重要的是，哦主，我们想用我们的恩赐在人们的生命中结出属灵的果子。我们祈求你帮助我们永远不要忘记这一点。永远不要忘记我们的眼睛充满了，我们不想对恩赐眼花缭乱。我们真正想要的是我们想看到基督的样式在我们自己的心中和我们周围人的心中成长。

使我们成为一个发生这种情况的教会。我们奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。

今天提姆·凯勒将探讨圣灵如何呼召我们信靠、将我们联合在一起、用恩赐装备我们，并塑造我们更像基督。我们今天早上的经文是以弗所书第四章第7至16节。我们各人蒙恩，都是照基督所量给各人的恩赐。所以经上说："他升上高天的时候，掳掠了仇敌，将各样的恩赐赏给人。"既说升上，岂不是先降在地下吗？

那降下的，就是远升诸天之上要充满万有的。他所赐的有使徒、有先知、有传福音的、有牧师和教师，为要成全圣徒，各尽其职，建立基督的身体，直等到我们众人在真道上同归于一，认识神的儿子，得以长大成人，满有基督长成的身量，使我们不再作小孩子，中了人的诡计和欺骗的法术，被一切异教之风摇动，飘来飘去，就随从各样的异端。惟用爱心说诚实话，凡事长进，连于元首基督。全身都靠他联络得合式，百节各按各职，照着各体的功用彼此相助，便叫身体渐渐增长，在爱中建立自己。

这是主的话语。在我们关于圣灵的系列中，我们来到了圣经所说的圣灵恩赐这个主题。你知道，在基督教事工中快要40年了，虽然看我的外表你可能看不出来，但快40年了，我见证了教会在属灵恩赐这个主题上摇摆到如此极端的位置。从过度关注它们到忽视它们，我认为我们将会看到，没有什么比拥抱圣经在这里给我们的——属灵恩赐的神学——更实际地帮助我们理解一个基督教会在地上具体看起来应该是什么样子的了。所以如果我们能避免这些极端，我们将学到很多关于我们应该是什么样子的东西。如果这

是你的教会，这个教会应该是什么样子，如果你来自其他教会，你那里的教会应该是什么样子。

让我们就这段经文提出三个问题。什么是属灵恩赐？然后属灵恩赐的神学有什么实际意义？对教会生活有什么影响？第三，我们如何正确使用属灵恩赐？

首先，它们是什么？让我给你一个基于多年思考圣经教导而得出的定义。这个定义是：属灵恩赐是圣灵赐给每个信徒的不同能力，用来满足需要，以此创造一个由正在成长到耶稣基督品格的完全的人所组成的群体。让我把这个定义分成三部分来解释。首先，属灵恩赐是满足需要的能力。

圣经中有五个属灵恩赐的清单。罗马书12章有一个，哥林多前书12章有两个，这里的以弗所书4章有一个，彼得前书4章有一个，每一个清单都相当不同。很明显，每一个清单都不是详尽无遗的，而是例证性的，即使你把它们全部放在一起，我们也没有列出所有的恩赐。但如果你读完它们，你会看到恩赐有不同的类别。有些恩赐是传达真理的能力，比如传福音、教导。

有些恩赐是承担重担的能力，所以你有鼓励、怜悯、服事、帮助和协助的恩赐。有些恩赐是给予方向的恩赐，所以你有领导、管理和智慧的恩赐，智慧是一种辅导的恩赐，是给个人指引的方式。但现在你看，没有任何人类的需要——无论是属灵的、身体的、心理的、关系的——是没有某种属灵恩赐可以满足的。属灵恩赐是满足这些需要的能力。你看，有些属灵恩赐在我们受伤时医治我们，或有些属灵恩赐在我们沮丧时鼓励我们。

有些属灵恩赐在我们落后时挑战我们，或在我们走偏时纠正我们，或在我们被拒绝时爱我们，或只是在我们无知时告知我们。没有任何人类需要是没有

某种属灵恩赐可以解决它。所以属灵恩赐就是满足需要的能力。其次，这些属灵恩赐是不同的，但却赐给了每一位信徒。看，经文说，基督赐给每个人一份圣灵的能力来满足需要。

尽管我们在基督里根本上都是一体的，属灵恩赐却创造了巨大的多样性，我们接下来会看到这一点。属灵恩赐不仅使基督徒在他们所看到的、所共鸣的、如何看待世界方面因人而异，个别基督徒之间也有着极大的不同，而且恩赐也使教会彼此不同。教会之间非常不同，因为这些教会中的恩赐组合可能与街对面教会的恩赐组合非常非常不同。因此，这是基督教会有如此惊人多样性的原因之一。这确实是人们说，为什么基督教会不更...

为什么会如此不同？为什么有那么多宗派？那么多教会。为什么？为什么？

原因之一就是这个。另一个原因是罪。原因之一就是这个。原因之一就是这个，但即使它使教会不同，每个信徒，经文并没有说某些信徒，超级信徒，特定的信徒，你们所有人都得到属灵恩赐。当经文说"我们每一个人"时，这里的"我们"是指基督徒，保罗不只是说我们这些传道人或诸如此类的，而是说每一个人。

所以每个人都得到一份。耶稣拥有所有的事工能力来传达真理、承担重担、给予指引。他拥有全部。我们得到他事工能力的一部分来满足需要，但每个人都得到一份，而且只是一部分。现在，第三点，这实际上是我今天要强调两三次的最重要的事情。

属灵恩赐的目标是什么？事工的目标是什么？保罗的句子非常长，它们甚至比英文中显示的更长，因为在英文中，译者通常将他的句子分成几个句子，以使其更清楚一些。有时这并不

要说出这一切的最终目标并不那么容易。每个人都得到了一个恩赐，然后你得到了一些更突出的恩赐，比如牧师、教师、传福音的、先知，然后呢？

为了装备人们进行服事的工作，所以每个人都在做自己的工作，但最终目标是什么？建立身体，直到我们在信仰上和对神儿子的认识上达到合一，并且成熟，达到基督丰盛的完全程度。这话说起来很绕口，但这就是所有事工的目的。教会中的事工，运用属灵恩赐，不仅仅是为了让人们在某种笼统的方式上感到快乐。首先，它是为了把我们塑造成一个身体。

属灵恩赐使我们成为一个身体。所以我常常喜欢说，聚集和会众是有区别的。聚集就像一袋弹珠。它们在那里，一千颗弹珠在一个袋子里，它们彼此相邻，但它们在滑动，没有任何特定的模式。它们彼此之间没有特定的关系，它们都在同一个袋子里。

有些教会就是聚集，但会众是一个身体，因为每一个恩赐都使你与其他恩赐不同，然而你的恩赐在教会中是绝对必要的。因此，圣灵使我们成为一个身体，所以你有你的头、你的手、你的脚和你的肘，这就是形象，但这意味着每个人不仅与弹珠不同，而且我们都彼此紧密相连。所以圣灵，尤其是属灵恩赐，使我们成为一个身体，但所有这些事工的全部目的是在彼此身上创造基督的样式。你不只是笼统地鼓励，不只是笼统地教导，不只是笼统地帮助。当属灵恩赐被正确运用时，在接受事工的人身上产生的结果是增长基督的样式，成长为耶稣的样式。

你知道那是什么吗？H.A.卡德伯里是哈佛大学神学和圣经教授，从1930年代到1950年代，他喜欢让那些从未读过圣经的本科生来上课，这当然是非常

很多，即使在那时。他喜欢让学生们，他们都听说过耶稣，但就是让他们读关于耶稣的记载，读那些关于他是什么样的人、他说了什么、他做了什么的记述，然后得到他所说的他们最原始的反应。而他们总是感到震惊。

他的一个学生写道，当你读到耶稣时，他是谁？他是什么？尽管对最软弱和最破碎的人来说，他是完全可接近的。这个学生写道，耶稣，尽管对最软弱和最破碎的人来说是完全可接近的，但在骄傲和腐败的人面前却毫不畏惧。尽管他深具人性，会疲倦、孤独，会被感动而生出喜乐、爱和愤怒，我们却从未看到他情绪化。

我们从未见过他前后不一致。他温柔却不软弱，刚强却不严苛，谦卑却丝毫不缺乏自信。他有信念却不狭隘，有热情却不狂热，有圣洁却没有法利赛主义，有激情却没有偏见。唯有这个人从未走错一步，从未发出不和谐的音符。这就是生命的最高境界。

而这正是属灵恩赐应当产生的结果。这就是关键所在。当属灵恩赐在会众中被使用时，这就是在人们生命中产生的结果。这就是为什么，我想说的关于属灵恩赐的最后一点是，属灵恩赐的本质是神的祝福，而不是行动的形式。我的意思是这样的。

我们生活，我会回到那两点。我们生活在纽约这样一个城市，真正重要的是，他们在这里告诉你，我不在乎你的口音，我不在乎你来自哪里，我甚至不在乎你如何表达、你看起来如何，你能产出成果吗？你够优秀吗？所以这里极其强调有才华、有恩赐、能够做事。而我们在这里必须认识到的是，属灵恩赐的关键不在于这项技能的技术完美度。

而在于它是否在人们身上产生出基督的样式。真正使属灵恩赐成为属灵恩赐的，是神的祝福，而不是行动的形式。这就是为什么你会知道，让我给你举两个例子，有些传道人的讲道如果你

分析它们，但总是给你改变生命的神的经历。为什么？因为重要的不是行动的形式，而是神的祝福。

这就是为什么有些属灵领袖做得很出色，他们把人聚集在一起，推动人们行动，完成事情，人们追随他们，即使他们并没有做哈佛商学院MBA课程告诉你应该做的那些事。为什么？我不是说，如果我在培训一位传道人，我会谈论技术性的东西。我会说，是的，这是你如何列提纲，这样人们不会失去你的思路，你知道的，你要说什么。但归根结底，使一项属灵恩赐成为属灵恩赐的，不是你所做之事的技术卓越性，而是神是否在祝福它。

当我们寻求在自己和周围的人身上认识恩赐时，特别是在纽约这样一个技术如此重要、过分重要的地方，让我们记住这一点。所以这就是它的本质。属灵恩赐是圣灵赐给每个信徒的不同能力，用以满足需要，但要以这样一种方式，在一群人中创造出基督的样式。其次，现在，如果这是真的，这就是你的神学。这有什么实际意义呢？

这会产生什么影响？这会创造出什么样的教会？好吗？让我给你四个，四个实际的含义，好吗？第一个是，这意味着在教会中不会有任何被动的、失业的基督徒。

如果接受这一神学，教会中就不会有任何被动的、失业的人。我希望你花一点时间思考这一神学的含义。在以弗所书第2章第10节有这样一句话：因为我们是神的工作，在基督耶稣里造成的，为要叫我们行善，就是神所预备叫我们行的。你被精心塑造，你独特的能力意味着有某些伟大的事情是你，是神要你去做的，或者换句话说。拿着你的恩赐，每个人的恩赐都是不同的，还有你的性别、你的种族、你在生活中的经历，你把所有这些放在一起。

但

这意味着世界上有些人需要被触及，而你就是世界上最适合触及他们的人，因为你就是你。有些事需要完成，是神想要在这个世界上完成的事。而因为你是谁，你就是最适合去做这些事的人。理解你的恩赐并运用你的恩赐，就是找到你生命的意义，你生命的使命。我们在教会中很难接受这些，我会给你两种不同的方式。

我们以两种不同的方式难以接受这个神学。在小型教会，问题是这样的。在小型教会里，有太多事情要做，却只有少数人去做。而且很多时候在小型教会里，你会发现人们在做很多他们根本没有恩赐去做的事情。结果就是他们过度劳累、精疲力竭。

而且很多时候他们把事情做得不是很好，因为他们没有恩赐去做这些事。这部分是因为小型教会经常会忽视属灵恩赐的神学，但我想让你知道，在我们这样的大教会，像救赎主这样的大教会，比小教会有更大的问题，原因如下。属灵恩赐是产出，事工是产出，事工是花费自己，献出自己，服侍、为他人做事。许多许多许多许多人来到像救赎主这样的大教会，是因为他们不会被要求做任何事。你来是因为我可以获得输入，大量的输入，高质量的输入，而没有人会要求我有产出，特别是如果你小心选择坐在哪里的话。

但如果你来到一个教会，主要获得输入而几乎没有产出，意思是你没有让自己负责任，没有参与到他人的生命中，没有在爱中向他们的生命说真理，没有使用你独特的恩赐来看到他们在基督的样式中被建造。看，如果你来了只是做输入而不做产出，也就是说你来了除了参加聚会之外没有真正做任何其他事情，你就是在违背圣灵对你生命的旨意。每个人都被赐予了恩赐。你是神的工作，有些事情只有你、唯独你能做，如果你

而上帝的旨意就在这里，那么我们其他人需要你，否则你不会在这里。他不会浪费人，不像我们其他人那样浪费资产。

因此，如果我们接受属灵恩赐的神学，那么绝对关键的是不能有失业或被动的基督徒。这是第一个含义，第二个含义。这也意味着我们应该预期，我已经暗示过这一点，我们应该预期在教会中因为属灵恩赐而出现一定程度的争论和冲突。我们需要在一定程度上预期这种情况。随着圣诞节即将来临，我们邀请人们注册我们的降临节灵修系列，您可以在11月30日至12月24日期间每天收到。

每日灵修将帮助您花时间思考基督降生带来的意义和喜悦。降临节的每一天，您都会收到一篇灵修，其中包含对圣经经文的默想，重点关注耶稣为何来到世上，使我们与天父和解。我们相信，在这个短暂的季节里，这是一个很好的工具，可以帮助您专注于我们通过基督降生所拥有的盼望、喜乐、平安和爱。您可以访问 gospelonlife.com/Advent 进行注册。再说一遍，要注册，请访问 gospelonlife.com/Advent。

除了每日电子邮件，您每个周日还会收到一条视频消息。每周的视频消息以提姆·凯勒的默想开始降临节的每一周，然后是提姆和凯西的简短讨论，谈论他们在默想中注意到的一些事情，我们的祷告是通过这个降临节系列，您体验到来自基督降生的盼望和喜乐，并且它在这个降临节季节成为对您的鼓励源泉。现在，我可能以前给你们讲过这个例子，但这是一个完美的例证。当我在弗吉尼亚州的一个小镇上担任我的第一个教会的全新牧师时，我24岁，我记得在最初的三天里，或者可能是前四天或五天，但有三个人几乎一个接一个地来看我。当然，他们总是想要，你知道，教会里的人想要顺便来确保年轻的传道人得到他的

头脑清醒，并按照他们的方式看待事物。

所以我记得第一天那个人来的时候，有一个人来了，我实际上记不清是谁第一个来的了。但就在第一天，那个人说，你看到外面的拖车屋了吗。我们在城镇的贫困地区，教会周围有拖车屋，人们住在拖车屋里。所以你看到外面那些拖车屋了吗，我说，是的，我说，你知道为什么我们没有接触到那些人吗？那些人没有一个来我们教会。

你知道为什么我们没有接触到那些人吗？我们没有传福音的心。那些人不认识基督，或者他们根本不去任何教会。我们没有传福音的心。我们应该出去跟那些人分享我们的信仰。

但是这个教会不做那个，好的，充分注意到了。一两天后，另一个人过来说，一个不同的人说，你看到外面那些拖车屋了吗。他们说，是的，我看到了。他们说，你知道为什么，这个教会的问题是什么吗？我说，不知道，是什么？

那些是穷人。那些是不同社会阶层的人。这些是有很多问题的人，我们不希望他们来我们教会。这就是问题所在。艺术教会不关心穷人。

艺术教会不想要他们进来会带来的那种问题。他们有很多个人问题，他们有经济问题，我们不想要那个。我们不知道如何处理那个。这就是这个教会的问题。缺乏怜悯，缺乏对穷人的关怀，好的，几天后，也许是第二天，另一个人进来对我说，你看到外面那些拖车屋了吗？

我说，是的，我看到了。那么你知道我们教会的问题是什么吗？现在出于某种原因，虽然是24岁意外地，我说了一些明智的话，我说，不知道，是什么？你知道，我已经做了笔记，我已经知道教会的问题是什么了。这个人说，我们教会有很多人有很多非常好的，他们有善意，他们有非常好的意图，他们想要接触社区，而我们不知道如何做。

这是一个蓝领教会，我们没有那些有组织的人。他们

不知道如何建立一个项目并执行它。他们不知道如何完成事情。他们不知道如何从这里到达那里。他们可以设定目标，但永远无法实现。

你知道，这三个人都是对的，这三个人都有恩赐，使他们能够看到问题所在，而其他人没有——他们有不同的恩赐，所以他们看不到同样的问题。他们都是对的。在某种程度上，必然会有争论，必须要有争论。另一方面，当你运用属灵恩赐的神学时，这使每个人都能意识到，哦，我之所以这样看事情，部分原因是因为我有某种恩赐。我需要满足那个需要，而且在某种意义上，我必须尊重其他人说他们所看到的——属灵恩赐的神学让你预期教会会有一定程度的混乱，因为一个理解属灵恩赐神学的教会意识到，事工会在各处涌现，从各种各样的地方涌现。

教会总会有一种活力。如果你真正接受属灵恩赐的神学，很多教会并不想要那样。他们想要完全从上层控制。他们想说，你知道，如果我们有事工的想法，我们这些在上层的人会告诉你。你不需要告诉我们。

我们会告诉你。而这会摧毁，这违背了属灵恩赐的神学。所以，如果你接受属灵恩赐的神学，不仅不会有消极被动的会众，同时，你也会有一定程度的争论，一定程度的冲突，人们会争论我们应该做什么，优先事项应该是什么。这是对的。为什么？

因为这是圣灵的工作。第三点。然而，圣灵的神学虽然会造成一定程度的争论，但应该消除嫉妒和骄傲。我所知道的每个组织，都有一些嫉妒和骄傲在发生，因为有些人最终成为领袖，有些人没有。

有些人最终拥有更多的权力和影响力，有些人则较少。拥有较少权力的人不信任拥有更多权力的人。或者甚至对他们感到嫉妒

对拥有更多的人充满怨恨。至少他们是不信任的。而拥有更多的人有时会对他人颐指气使，并为自己的地位感到非常自豪。

但属灵恩赐的整个理念是，神已经做了所有的任命。祂已经做出了任命。所以让我给你们一个案例研究。你们这些长老会信徒，既然我们是长老教会，当你们选举长老时，你们在做什么？你们选举长老时在做什么？

你们只是在认可神所赐予的恩赐。你们只是在认可神所任命的人。就是这样。如果你明白这一点，那么A，如果你最终被选上，你将不会有任何骄傲。B，如果你没有被选上，如果你是那些进行选举的人之一，那么你会说，这是神的任命，这不是人们游说并让他们的人支持之类的事情。

所以这只是神的任命。这就是应该发生的。属灵恩赐神学的奇特之处在于，一方面，如果你接受它，它会在教会中产生更多的争论和竞争。另一方面，它实际上应该是一种润滑剂，这样当我们交谈、当我们争辩、当我们推动时，就会有极大的尊重。

没有嫉妒，没有怨恨，没有骄傲，没有傲慢。最后，这个属灵恩赐神学的最后一个含义，不仅仅是，从某种意义上说，我们正在达到那里，果子，属灵果子必须是真正的目标，而属灵恩赐必须被视为仅仅是手段。属灵恩赐只是达到耶稣基督品格完全身量的目的的手段。果子和恩赐不是同一回事，永远不要把恩赐误认为果子。我是什么意思？

属灵果子，我们最近谈论过这个，不是吗？今年，属灵果子列在加拉太书第5章。属灵果子是品格特质，爱、喜乐、和平、忍耐、恩慈、良善、谦卑、正直、自制，每个基督徒都应该有所有的果子。但我们被告知属灵恩赐，没有基督徒拥有所有的属灵恩赐，为什么？区别在于，果子与

你的存在，恩赐是行事，果子是你的品格——你是谁，恩赐是技能和你所做的事，永远、永远、永远不要把恩赐误认为果子。

我不仅因为圣经这样说而必须在世界各地都说这点，而且我必须特别在纽约说这一点，原因我已经告诉你们了。在纽约，人们极其强调把事情做成、才能等等。而很容易发生的情况是这样的。如果你忙碌起来，如果你开始做事，开始服侍人，开始做志愿者，而人们因你得到帮助。人们喜爱你所做的事，这甚至不必通过教会。

如果你总是为人们付出，以至于有这么多人依赖你。你知道你会开始做什么吗？你会开始说，神与我同在。看看我帮助的所有人。看看我所影响的所有生命。

神与我同在。你在做什么？你在违背属灵恩赐的神学。恩赐不是果子。你在看，让我告诉你什么是你的果子。

你是否发现自己越来越快乐，无论你的处境如何？越来越有信心，即使在事情不顺时，而不是情绪总是起起伏伏。那就是果子。你是否发现自己越来越谦卑，越来越不在意批评和人们对你的评价？因为你在神里面如此绝对地安全。

那就是果子。你是否发现你的祷告生活丰富，你感受到神的同在和祂的爱，这就是你情绪不那么起伏的原因，你能够更好地接受批评，你能够应对糟糕的处境。那就是果子，但这里会发生的情况是，你里面可能是空虚的，你与神的关系实际上不太好，你在果子上并没有成长，然而你出去帮助人们，你与人们交谈，你鼓励人们，你教导人们，他们说，哦，你帮了我这么多，然后你开始对自己感觉良好。你千万不要这样做。你知道你在做什么吗？

你知道你在做什么吗。查尔斯·司布真，一位伟大的浸信会传道人，多年前，现在已经很多年前了，写了

为他的学生写的一本书，这些都是其他神学生，我永远不会忘记读到的那一行。他说，不要为了拯救你的灵魂而进入事工，我记得当时想，什么样的白痴会在自己还没得救的情况下进入事工，你知道，当时我自己就是个白痴。而现在我明白他的意思了。当你用属灵恩赐来替代属灵果子时，当你用忙碌来掩盖自己内心的不快乐和空虚，以及你自己与神缺乏良好关系时，你可以在教会里成为大人物，但最终这是致命的，你知道为什么吗？

因为没有果子的恩赐就像没有气的轮胎。没有果子的恩赐，你知道，当你的轮胎漏气时，如果你继续行驶，继续行驶，它会暂时保持充气状态，然后当你到达红绿灯时，已经有很多人的生活在属灵上走向毁灭。然而因为他们非常活跃，许多牧师，当然，你知道的。他们非常有名。他们做了很多好事，他们实际上改变了很多人的生命。

为什么？因为他们的恩赐在发挥作用。在内心，有各种各样的问题、困难、你知道的、罪恶、你知道的、空虚。他们在掩盖这些，他们向外看，他们说看那，他们是高调的。他们把恩赐误认为是果子，但任何人都可以这样做，人们一直在这样做。

你千万不要这样做。重点是你里面基督的样式，重点是其他人里面基督的样式。因此，永远不要把恩赐误认为是果子。果子是中心，果子是目的，你知道，恩赐只是手段。这就是圣灵的神学，如果我们接受它，这将是一个多么不同的教会。

现在这把我们带到最后一点，这就是我们所看到的，我们正处于需要这最后一点的边缘。我们如何正确使用我们的属灵恩赐？我想向你展示，我刚才确实向你展示了，属灵恩赐的运用有各种各样的问题。它可能导致权力斗争和嫉妒。在某些情况下，它导致被动，因为人们只是不接受这个神学。

一切。

它可能导致精疲力竭，因为人们真的非常努力地工作，本质上是为了填补自己生命中的空虚，而不是去寻求神，无论他们是在利用自己的服事，还是在以这种方式帮助他人。围绕属灵恩赐有各种各样的问题。我们如何才能正确地使用它们？答案就是一个词。你在这里看到它，当然在哥林多前书中保罗谈到它时你也肯定能看到。

这个词就是爱。注意，第15和16节，整个要点是，用爱心说诚实话，我们就会建造自己，达到基督的丰盛。当身体的每一部分都正确地发挥作用时，身体就会在爱中建造自己，一遍又一遍，保罗从不谈论属灵恩赐而不谈论爱。当然，最著名的是在哥林多前书12章和14章，他在谈论属灵恩赐，而就在第13节的中间，第13章，保罗给出了关于爱的著名段落。为什么？

因为保罗一遍又一遍地说，如果你消极被动，不使用你的恩赐，那只是缺乏爱，你是自私的。如果你精疲力竭、过度劳累，因为你在服事每个人、帮助每个人，因为内心的空虚，那是因为缺乏爱，你的生命中并没有真正拥有神的爱。如果你趾高气扬、大有能力，那是缺乏爱。如果你嫉妒羡慕某个有能力的人，那是缺乏爱。你需要爱，否则属灵恩赐会毁掉我们，或者缺乏属灵恩赐会毁掉我们。

你如何得到那份爱？你必须去看这段经文的那个部分，当它被读给你听时，你完全不理解的那一部分。那就是关键。正如经常发生的那样，那是什么？就是这段经文的开头。

我们各人蒙恩，都是照基督所量给各人的。这些年来每当我读到这里，我读第7节，然后读到第11节，那里又变得有意义了，然后你继续读。这都是什么意思？这就是为什么它说，他升上高天的时候，掳掠了仇敌，将各样的恩赐赏给人。"他升上"是什么意思？

他也曾降在地下。那降下的，就是

正是那位升到诸天之上、为要充满万有的主。这是什么意思呢？请跟随我，只需要大约120秒，你就会开始看到保罗所说的奇妙之处。在古代，如果国王在他的城里，而有敌人来侵略并奴役所有人，国王就会出去与敌人作战。如果他赢了，如果他把他的百姓从压迫和囚禁中拯救出来，他就会凯旋而归，回到他的宝座上，升上他的宝座坐下，这样他的同在就再次临到百姓中间，然后他会赐下礼物。

也就是说，他会拿出他在征服中赢得的财富，这会使整个城市富足起来。现在在诗篇68篇18节，也就是保罗在这里引用的经文，诗人看到一个特定的事件，并通过征服的君王所做之事的基本框架来解读它。他们会出去，把百姓从压迫中拯救出来，凯旋归来，带来他们的同在，然后赐下礼物。他们正在观察发生的事情。诗人看到的事实是，大卫王将代表神的舍吉拿同在的约柜带到耶路撒冷，登上锡安山，就是耶路撒冷会幕所在的地方，并将约柜带进了至圣所。

整篇诗篇之所以在庆祝这件事，是因为在某种程度上它意识到神才是终极的君王。这就是出埃及记的终结，因为神已经把百姓从奴役、从囚禁中领出来。他击败了埃及，把他们从囚禁中领了出来。而现在，神终于升上了他的宝座。他现在在会幕中临在于他百姓中间。

这胜利的果实，就是应许之地的奶与蜜。这就是诗人所说的，但耶稣，但听着，保罗总是这样读旧约，就像你我应当读旧约一样。他从不能、他永远无法停止思想耶稣。他读到那篇关于大卫带约柜的诗篇，读到神的同在升上和礼物，以及神的胜利

胜过压迫，突然保罗意识到神还没有完成。当那一切结束时，神还没有完成。

君王上帝有一个更大的敌人要击败——罪和死亡，君王上帝有一种更好的方式住在祂子民中间，胜过会幕中的约柜。上帝还有更好的属灵恩赐要赐下。你知道发生了什么吗？这就是上帝的做法。耶稣基督降临了。

这是关键。祂降临了。祂从天降到地。祂从尊荣和荣耀，降到受辱和被拒绝，降到酷刑和死亡。祂被羞辱了。

祂被摧毁了。祂降临了。为什么？当祂走上十字架时，你知道祂在做什么吗？祂在击败旧约的埃及——罪和死亡，祂在为我们的罪获得赦免。

所以不仅仅是那个柜子，约柜是一个代表神同在的柜子。所以圣灵实际上可以进入我们的生命，因为我们的罪已经得到赎罪。所以神的同在可以进入我们中间，我们可以得到终极的属灵恩赐，就是圣灵自己的能力，将人带入与神的关系中。这就是爱。大卫带来了约柜。

他冒着生命危险将神的同在带给百姓，但耶稣基督却是以祂生命的代价做到这一点。耶稣降临了。祂失去了一切。这就是爱。这就是你需要的爱。

除非你被那爱融化、塑造、深刻改变，被对那爱的认识所融化、塑造、深刻改变。祂为你做了这一切。都是为了你。否则你就无法真正恰当地运用你的属灵恩赐。但看见这一点，你就能做到。

所以最后，你想正确地运用你的属灵恩赐吗？第一，你必须有圣灵。你必须是基督徒。你必须相信福音。如果你没有圣灵，你就无法使用你的属灵恩赐。

好的。第二，我如何识别我的属灵恩赐？没有你想的那么难。尝试许多不同类型的事工，然后询问你自己的内心，询问教会，询问你周围的人。但第三，看耶稣。

看这个人。在福音书中看这位完美的人。看到如此美丽的事物。看祂的

品格。看到祂的圣洁，也看到祂的爱。

看到祂的宽恕，也看到祂的力量和勇敢。看到这些，然后说：我不想只是快乐而已，我想要像祂一样。我想要我身边所爱的人都像祂一样。现在使用你的属灵恩赐吧。

现在是安全的了。让我们祷告。父啊，感谢你赐给我们这伟大的属灵恩赐神学。我们祈求在纽约市的我们能够拥抱它。我们要么一直是被动的，要么是骄傲的。

愿我们不断认识到属灵恩赐带来的美好混乱，但与此同时，认识到你所指定的、你所设立的，使我们谦卑，使我们的骄傲降低，使我们能够倾听他人。最重要的是，主啊，我们想用我们的恩赐在人们的生命中结出属灵的果子。我们祈求你帮助我们永远不要忘记这一点。永远不要忘记我们的眼睛充满——我们不想对恩赐抱有明星般的幻想。我们真正想要的是，我们想看到基督的样式在我们自己的心中以及我们周围人的心中成长。

使我们成为一个能发生这种事的教会。我们奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。
