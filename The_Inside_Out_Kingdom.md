## English Transcript / 英文原文

today's teaching from the sermon on the Mount, Tim Keller shows how Christ offers  us practical guidance for living out a compelling vision of a new kind of community shaped  by grace. What are you? When people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because  of me. Rejoice and be glad because great is your reward in heaven. For in the same way, they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled by men. You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden, neither do people light up the lamp and put it under  a bowl.

Instead, they put it on its stand and give it light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before men that they may see your good deeds and  praise your Father in heaven. Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets. I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not  the least stroke of a pen, will be by any means disappear from the law until everything  is accomplished.

Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the  same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers  of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven. This is God's word. We're looking at the Sermon on the Mount because we're going to look for a number of weeks  at what it means to live the Christian life.

How is the Christian life concretely different when it's lived out? Now, last week when we looked at the first very first part of the Sermon on the Mount,  the Beatitudes and the woes, we saw that the Christian life is based on a very different  set of values in that of the world. And therefore, the first step in understanding the distinctiveness of the Christian life  is to notice that it's distinct, the Christianity's distinct from the world and what all that  means. We're not going back over that. That was last week.

But before you actually get into the specifics of Christian practice in the Sermon  on the Mount, there is another distinction that has to be made or you won't get Christianity. Another introductory general basic distinction because Christianity is not just different from  the world, Christianity is also distinct from religion. You see where it says Pharisees and teachers of the law, in fact every place it says Pharisees  and teachers of the law would help a lot if you just put in their religious leaders. And what Jesus is saying is Christianity is different than religion. Now this is key to understanding Christianity.

And it's a very helpful thing to think about this time of year. Swiss Theologian Karl Bart suggested this idea. He said there is an anti-Semitic way of speaking about the death of Jesus. As some people out of anti-Semitic bias and feelings say the Jews killed Jesus. And Karl Bart says not only is that anti-Semitic, but it's nonsense.

It doesn't help. It's not illuminating. He says imagine somebody saying the Greeks killed Socrates. Well you'd say okay well Socrates was Greek, his enemies were Greek, his friends were  Greek. Of course Greeks would be involved in the death of Socrates.

But that doesn't really, that's not specific and I wouldn't really tell me who killed Socrates  when you say Greeks killed Socrates. And the same way Jesus was a Jew and his friends were Jewish and his enemies were Jewish. So to say Jews killed Jesus. Of course Jews were involved. But it doesn't really, it's not specific and it doesn't really tell us who killed Jesus.

Karl Bart said who did kill Jesus? Religious people killed Jesus. He says not only do you see everywhere in the New Testament, a hostility by Jesus toward  religion. When Jesus gets near people from the world, when Jesus gets near worldly people, he's very  patient, very kind. When he gets near religious leaders, he's very sharp.

But on the other hand, it's religious people that were the most angry at what Jesus said  over and over and over again. The crowds, the Hoy Paloie, the common people of the world, they were fascinated with Jesus. Maybe they didn't believe what he said. But the religious people were angry. And the one of the main points of the New Testament is you're never going to get Christianity  unless you see that it is something utterly different than religion.

Not only that, it's not just a key to understanding Christianity, it's a key to understanding  the whole sermon on the mount. At the end of the sermon on the mount, both in its version we have in Luke, chapter 6, and  its version we have in Matthew 5 to 7, you have at the very end of the sermon on mount,  Jesus always ends by saying, now in summary and conclusion, I put before you these two  ways. Now, they're very famous statements. He says, there's two paths. One leads to life, one leads to destruction.

There are two trees, one has good fruit, but one has poison fruit. There's two houses, one is built on the rock and one is built on the sand. And what he's saying is, here you have two ways, two trees, two houses, two ways of life,  and on the surface they look very, very much the same. But one of the ways is poison. It poisons its eaters.

It destroys its travelers. It collapses on its residents. Now, what are those two ways? At the end of the sermon on the mount, what are the two ways that Jesus is putting in front  of us? Because it's not this tree, this tree.

Not this way, this way, not this house, this house. What are they? And traditionally, and I have to admit, I have done it too, as a preacher, traditionally,  people read that and say, oh, what Jesus is saying is, you can either live, according  to the sermon on the mount, you can live according to the law of God, the commandments of  God, you can either obey God's laws, or you can  disobey God's laws, see, life destruction, good fruit, bad fruit. You can either live obeying God's laws, or you can disobey God's laws. But a commentator changed my whole understanding of the sermon on the mount when he said, does  it make sense that Jesus Christ would say, in summary, there are these two ways, and they  look extremely alike, just that one of them has poison fruit, see, two houses, two ways,  two trees.

It makes sense that Jesus would talk about two ways at the conclusion of a sermon and  not have talked about those two ways in the sermon. Does it make sense if those two ways that he's putting in front of us, one of which he's  in joining, and one of which he's warning us against? Does it make sense that those two ways would be good and bad, people that obey God's law,  people who disobey God's law? Because how would those both be two trees that look alike? How would those both be two houses that look alike?

The commentator said, you've got to go back in and you go into the sermon on the mount,  and see if he has, is the sermon on the mount how to live? The Christian life simply is that it, or is the sermon on the mount contrasting these  two ways? Are the two ways in the sermon, and they are, but the scary thing is it's not what you think. When you go in there, you're not going to see Jesus says, here's the people who obey God's  law, and here's the people who don't. Never.

When you go through the sermon, here's what you see. First of all, you'll see him say, and this is a, we're going to get into this as the  week's going on, but he doesn't say, here's people who pray, and here's people who don't  pray. No. He says, you pray like this, but you should pray like this. He doesn't say, here's people that give to the poor, and here's people who don't give  to the poor.

No, he doesn't say that. He says, some people give to the poor like this, but I say, give like this. So they say, here's people who obey the 10 commandments, and here's people who don't. No. He says, you hear the 10 commandments, the commandment thou shalt not murder.

You obey like this, but I say obey like this. Here's what the scary thing is. In the sermon on the mount, Jesus Christ is contrasting two ways. One is not good, and the other bad, they're both good. In that, both groups of people are obeying the God's law.

Both groups of people are following the 10 commandments. Both groups of people are praying. Both groups of people are giving to the poor. Both groups of people are going to church, you know, worship. Both groups of people are studying the Bible.

And yet, one is poison. And you can see it right here in this very text. Look at verse 19. Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the  same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. Whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

Look at that. Notice both those groups of people in verse 19 are in the kingdom of heaven. Some are doing well, some are doing not so well, but they're both in. And then suddenly, verse 20, he says, however, there's the religious people, their righteousness,  they're not in the kingdom of heaven at all. He says, your righteousness must surpass their righteousness.

And what he's saying is not, they're good in your bad, or you're good in their bad,  but you're both trying to do the same thing. You're both trying to obey God. However, what here's what Jesus is saying, Christianity is vastly beyond its surpasses  religion. It's something utterly different than religion. That's what he's saying.

Don't mistake Christianity for religion. Don't mistake Christianity for going to worship and praying and giving to the poor. Don't mistake Christianity for that. You can do all that and be poisoned. On your way to destruction.

House on the sand. That's what he's saying. Now does that scare you? It should. I have been a poor communicator in these first few minutes.

Because surely, surely, people are saying you're kidding, right? I thought Christianity was about, you leave the Amal lifestyle and you try to live according  to the Bible in the example of Christ and the law of God, isn't that it? The answer is no. That's part of it. That's involved clearly, but that's to miss the point.

The key is Jesus says, if you want to be in the kingdom of heaven, there's a way. There's a gospel goodness that vastly surpasses religious righteousness. How does it surpass? Well, four ways and they build on each other. Gospel goodness surpasses religious righteousness in four ways.

It's brighter because it's deeper. It's deeper because it's sweeter. It's sweeter because it's higher. Gospel goodness surpasses because it's brighter and deeper and sweeter and higher. Number one, brighter.

I mean, literally, it says, you're the light of the world. Notice there's two groups of people here. There's people whose light doesn't say light and darkness. There's two groups of people doing good deeds. The one is doing it under a bowl and one's doing it in a way that the world is attracted and is delighted.

Therefore, the first difference between gospel goodness and religious righteousness,  the first way for you to be able to tell the difference is in this relationship to the world. Christianity is attracted to and attractive to. Hear that? I'm sorry, I don't know if I can get this through. Christianity is attracted to ED at the end and attractive to IVE at the end.

People who you don't agree with, people who don't live the way you do,  people who don't believe what you believe. Christianity is attracted to and attractive to but religious people are turned off by,  you see, and they are very, very, very alienating to people who disagree with them. Now here's what I mean, let's press this. First of all, Christians are attracted. Notice where it says, they are salt.

You are the salt of the earth. Now, what is salt? Back in those days, the main thing salt did was a preservative. You didn't put salt into water because water doesn't go bad. You put salt into meat because meat's going bad.

It's falling apart unless you put salt in it. And what this is telling us is Christians by the nature of what their Christianity,  when they see things falling apart, they get in there. When you see somebody emotionally falling apart, you go in like salt. When you see a neighborhood socially or economically falling apart, you go in. Christians are attracted, deeds of love and mercy, in their salt.

Religious people, however, they're under a bull. What does that mean? Well, it means that they really want to stick together. They don't like being out there with all those people that differ. They're not at all attracted to neighborhoods that are falling apart.

They're not at all attracted to people that are falling apart. They look around and they pull their skirts in. That's the difference between religiousness and Christianity. But not only that, Christians are not just attracted to,  but they're attractive to people who disagree with them and who live a very different life  and don't believe what they believe. Because notice, not only do you have the idea of light, beautiful light, but again, salt  has another side to it.

The other job of salt was not just to be a preservative. It was also to make something taste good. Now, not about you, for example, I can't stand corn in the cobweb without salt on it. But when I have eaten a piece of corn in the cob that I really like, I put it down and  what do I say? Do I say, honey?

That was great salt. No, you said that was great corn in the cob. Why? Because the job of salt is not to make you think how great the salt is, but how great the  thing is that it's involved with. I mean, we push this along.

What if you're salt in your small group Bible study? Well, if you're salt, people won't go away saying, boy, that person really, really knows  the Bible had all the answers, showed me up. No, what happens is when you go away from a small group in which you've been to salt,  people don't go away saying, how great that person, they go away saying, what a great  group. Now, this is pretty simple. See, salt makes you feel better about what you, in other words, the Christians make  you feel better, religious people always make you feel condemned, make you feel worse.

And you have this place in chapter 7, a little later on in this terminal amount that  you have a very famous place. Again, you can see right away, Jesus contrasting it two ways. He says, judge not, let's you be judged. He says, you hypocrites, if you don't take a speck out of your brother's eye and miss  the plank in your own eye, now what's all that about? Some people have said, well, that means you're not supposed to make moral evaluations.

You're not supposed to try to persuade people that your religion is right. It's judging. Now, of course, that's not true. Why? Because to say, you mustn't make moral evaluations, is to make a moral evaluation, and to say you  must not persuade people that your religious point of view is right, is to persuade that  person that your religious point of view is right, which means it's impossible not to make  it moral evaluations.

How do we impossible? As soon as you say, let's not do it, you've just done it. You have to do it in order to deny it. You have to use it. In order to even say, I'm not going to do it.

What is Jesus saying, then? Judging is doing moral evaluations with superiority or, let me press it, the Christian is somebody  who always sees your own sin as a speck, as a plank, and the sins of other people as specks,  religious people always see their own sins as specks, and everybody else as sins as a plank. That's the reason why religious people always make you feel worse, they make you feel condemned,  and the reason why Christianity is salt and white. Now, by the way, quick caveat before we move on, I didn't say Christianity, beliefs are  popular. Oh, my goodness, no.

I'm not saying that. When I say the gospel goodness is attractive and attracting, I'm saying gospel goodness. I'm not saying the gospel. Gospel is still very repugnant to people. As soon as you open your mouth about what you believe, you'll get some trouble.

Here's the difference. If you have gospel goodness in you, you never, ever, ever act or feel superior to anybody  else, especially the people who are different from you. This is the reason, by the way, why your attitude toward New York City is one of the best  ways to tell whether you're a Christian or a religious person. Because when you take a look at New York City, you're going to see two things. First of all, you're going to see some things falling apart, and religious people say who  wants to live in there, which shows you have no saltiness at all.

They're going to say, in other words, religious people look around and say, what's wrong  with these people? And see, which of course is my sin is a speck, your sin is a plank. And not only that, when you take a look around New York City, one of the things you can see  right off the bat, you can see them just walking out. You can look at some people and say, here's somebody who does not obey the ten commandments. It's not that hard to see.

And Christians aren't turned off by that. And religious people totally are. So the first point is, gospel goodness is brighter. It's attractive. You say, why?

Well, let's move on. Because, secondly, gospel goodness is deeper. And here we're not talking about the relationship with the world. We're talking about a relationship with your own heart. When Jesus Christ said in verse 20, I tell you that unless your righteousness or passes  that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom  of heaven.

When he said that, he knew that everybody must have just been utterly incredibly amazed. Because the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were basically full-time, they did  full-time obedience. That was their job. They had divided, you know, they worked out the Bible into something like 635 laws. And they just, they had the checklist.

They had positive laws and they had negative laws, things you had to do, things you were  supposed to avoid. And they just spent all day working on it. And when Jesus Christ says, you know, your righteousness has to surpass. Right away, people must have said, how could that be? Oh, and the world could be more righteous than the scribes and the teachers of the law and  the Pharisees.

And actually the answer is kind of weird because you see, it's a little bit like saying,  here's this river and it's a mile wide. And when Jesus says you have to surpass the river, it doesn't necessarily mean you've  got to go that way. Maybe he means you've got to go this way. Maybe the river is a mile wide, but it's only an inch deep. And therefore, as soon as he says verse 20, the next few verses immediately show Jesus  is answering the questions that he knew would be right in people's minds.

What does he mean when he says you have to surpass? Well, in verse 21, 27, 31, 33, 43 in other words, over and over and over again. He says, you've heard that I say. And he goes through the 10 commandments. You've heard, now shall not murder.

You've heard that shall not commit adultery. You've heard it said, now shall keep thy promises not lie. Keep your oath. He's gone to the 10 commandments. So what is he doing?

In every case he says, you're concerned, you religious people are concerned with the  external, I'm concerned with the heart. You can have the external and the heartbeat just like everybody else in the world. But if your heart is a different, is completely new, then you'll have the external too. Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer? Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith?

For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding  of what it means to follow Christ. A great resource to start using this summer is the new city-catechism devotional, God's  truth for our hearts and minds. This devotional brings the historic catechisms of the Christian Church to life, offering a question  to consider for each week of the year. In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catechesis, the rich and communal  practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers that frame the foundational beliefs  of the Christian faith. Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer, and a brief meditation that will challenge  and inspire you.

The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller, and  Kevin D. Young, as well as historical figures such as Augustine, John Calvin, and Martin  Luther. This month, in addition to the new city-catechism devotional, we are including a great  companion resource, the new city-catechism for kids, as our thank you for your gift,  to help gospel and life share the hope of Christ's love with people all over the world. So request your copies today at gospelonlife.com-slashgive, that's gospelonlife.com-slashgive. Now here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching.

Now here's what he does, let me show you, you know, it's just this sort of thing will  make you sink in your pews. He says, okay, let's take a look at murder. You've heard it said that I'll show a lot murder. Religious people are concerned about not physically murdering somebody, but I say unto you. He says, if in your heart you have ill will, if you despise them, if you think of people  as fools, if you disdain them, if you're indifferent to them, you've killed them.

And then he was on a sex, says, you've heard it said I'll show a committed adultery. Now, you know, the Christian sex ethic is no sex outside marriage. Well, what is that all about? Well, here's what it's about, which Jesus shows you when you have sex outside marriage,  what you're doing is you're saying, I want to have physical, external, nakedness and vulnerability,  but I don't want to give you personal nakedness and vulnerability. In other words, let's be naked physically, but I don't want to actually give myself to you  in every other way.

I don't want to get married to you. I don't want to give up my independence. I don't want to give up my options. I don't want to really give my, in other words, I don't want to back up physical nakedness  and vulnerability with actual personal, complete nakedness and vulnerability. I don't want to do that.

And Jesus Christ says, when you ask for physical nakedness and you don't have the integrity  or the guts to back it up with personal, in other words, if you're not willing to put  your whole heart there, it says that's lust. And when you do that, even in fantasy, you're stabbing yourself in the heart. Then he goes on to truth. And he says, you've heard it said that if you've taken oath, you better stick with the oath. But he says, again, that's all external.

In other words, you've signed a contract. And if you break the contract, the lawyers will come after you. And this and that sort of thing. He says, I say unto you, let your yes be yes and let your no be known. What does he mean?

What he means is your heart should be so full of integrity  that every single thing you say, every yes and every no  should be taken as seriously by you as if you just swore on a stack of Bibles  because external consequences should mean nothing. In other words, he goes on and on and on all the way through when he talks about turning the other cheek. You know, or don't pay back. He says, you may not be paying back physically, but I say unto you, turn the other cheek,  what does turn the other cheek? We'll get to that later this spring, but basically what does turn the other cheek?

Turn the other cheek means not just you refrain from paying back,  but you're still hoping for a relationship. You're still hoping, you're hoping for that person. You want him someday to kiss you. That's why you turn the other cheek. You don't turn the other cheek in order to get hit.

That's another sermon. But see, the whole point of turning other cheek is Jesus says, don't you dare just refrain  from vengeance externally. I don't just ask for that. I say to you, when you look at a person who's wronged you, no matter how messed up  and no matter how vicious they've been, you need to treat them with hope. You need to treat them with forgiveness.

If you're going to oppose them, you should never oppose them except in love and good will. Now, by the time you get to the end of this whole section, you're kind of like a massive  smoking wreckage. You're sitting here like this and you started to say, listen, Buddha, Confucius, Muhammad,  any teacher of ethics, there's never been a teacher who's asked for this. Never. Never a teacher who's wanted to go this deep.

You see in a way, verse 20 is easy. He says, you have to surpass the scribes and the Pharisees and the Jews of the Law. He says, you have to surpass the religious people. What he really means is, I want you to have your heart changed and religion only worries  about the externals. And you have an awful lot of people who are doing the law, you know, they're not committing  adultery and they're not killing and they're not paying back and they're telling the truth.

But they're doing it exactly the way the world does out of fear and out of pride. He's like, here's a religious person and they say, I tell the truth. And here's a worldly person and they're cheating everywhere and they're lying and they're  doing all this stuff. Oh, the religious person says, I don't lie. I'm not like them.

Well, now why is that worldly person cheating and lying? A, fear. One of the reasons you lie is you say, oh my goodness, I might lose my money, I might  lose my reputation. Fear. The other is pride.

You say, I'm going to get them. I'm going to pull a number on them. Fear and pride lead them to lie. Why does a religious person not lie? Why does a religious person tell the truth?

Why? Here's what Jesus says, fear and pride. Either you say, I'm not going to lie because God will get me, boy, better not lie. He's going to get ahold of me. He's going to take me out.

In the other possible way, religious people say, I'm not going to lie, why? Because I'm not like those kinds of people that lie. I'm not a liar. I'm a good person. So at a fear and at a pride, you don't lie.

And over here, at a fear and at a pride, they do lie. And Jesus says, what's the difference? See, one kind of goodness, a selfish goodness. Religious goodness is selfish goodness. It's trying to get leverage.

It's trying to say, if I lie, if I tell the truth, then God will have to be good to me. If I tell the truth, then I can feel superior to other people. This is the reason why religious goodness is so alienating and this is the reason it's  so shallow. Hmm. And that's the reason why that's the reason why gospel goodness is brighter because it's  deeper.

Okay. Then why is it so deep? And here's the answer. Thirdly, because it's sweeter. Gospel goodness has a center of sweetness.

There's something that's happened in the center. The good news about the sermon on the Mount is this. When you read through carefully, you will see that Jesus Christ does not say, try to live  like this and then God will be your father. Oh, no. All the way through here, he says, you can live like this if you already know God's your  father.

Look at verse 16. He says, why are you going to be able to let your light shine? Why are you going to have an attitude toward the world that's non-condescending? Why are you going to love people to disagree with you? Why are you going to be light?

Why are you going to be bright? Because God's your father. Where let me go deeper into the sermon. He in, not out into my sermon, the sermon on the Mount, I'm already very deep into the  sermon. In chapter 6, this is a fascinating place where Jesus says, don't worry, have no anxiety  about anything.

And you say, what, what kind of command is that? How can I stop worrying? How can I stop worrying? And if you treat this religiously, of course, you're going to say, I guess I've got to stop  worrying. How do I do that?

What I got to. And Jesus says, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, he says, he says, have  not an anxiety about these things. Don't you see God taking care of the birds? Don't you see God taking care of the lilies of the field? Don't you know that your heavenly father, if he cares for them, don't you know how much  more valuable you are than them?

Now here's what Jesus is showing us. The sermon on the Mount is impossible unless you know you're valuable. Jesus sums it. And the difference between religion and Christianity is this. Religion obeys the law of God unto value, trying to get value.

In chapter 6 it says the reason you give to the poor is so people will honor you. In chapter 6 it says the reason that you pray is to get God to listen to you for your many  words. See, a religious person is trying to get value, a religious person is saying, if I do all  these good things, then God will have to listen to me and then people will honor me. You are trying to get value and that's the reason why you're alienating. That's the reason why deep inside you're filled with fear and pride.

But gospel is obeying God's law out of value, not unto, not seeking value, but because  you know. That's amazing. In other words, unless there's a center of sweetness, unless there's this incredible  inner sweetness, a knowledge that you are of incredible value to him, there's  nothing he would do. You know, he was nothing he would not do in order to hold on to you and keep you. He's a father, not a boss.

If you're an employee and you're good, you've got a boss. And if you're bad and you disobey the laws, you're fired. But if you're a child and you've got a father or a mother and you're good, you've got  a father or mother and you're bad, you've got a grumpy father or mother but you've got  a father or mother. In fact, oh, fathers and mothers, you know something, don't you? And that is, this is something very weird that if you've got three children, my guy do,  and one of those being disobedient, so often the disobedient one has your heart the most.

Why? It's the nature of parenthood. And when Jesus comes along and says, the secret of the difference between good gospel goodness  and religious righteousness is that you have got as a father. That happens before you can obey. It's not something you obey in order to get.

It's something you obey because of. When you know God as your father, when you have that center of sweetness, changes everything. See, religious people, for example, never do anything unless it's about them. Why do you help a little lady across the street? It's not about her, it's about you.

Maybe God will answer your prayers and you'll feel like a pretty good person. See? Why do you help the poor? It's not about the poor. It's about you.

It's the reason why very often the religious people's help over the poor is so condescending  and so ineffective because it's filled with superiority. Why does a religious person pray? It's about you. It's not for him. That's the reason why your prayers are filled with petition and very little adoration and  repentance.

Therefore, you see, you're brighter. It's brighter because it's deeper, it's deeper because it's sweeter and it's sweeter  why, finally, how do you become a child of God? How is it possible that you could know that he's your father? See, somebody out here is saying, well, wait a minute, isn't God the father of everybody? God is the father of all people.

And what Jesus is saying is, well, yes, in one sense, but not in a sense I'm talking  about because he says knowing God as your father is the heart of what makes you a Christian  rather than a religious person. And not being sure about God's love and not being sure who you are and not being sure  is the heart of religiosity. And using goodness, really, it's about you. It's not about the people around you or God. It's leverage goodness.

I do it to get leverage. It's manipulative goodness. I do it in order to get people in God to do the things I want. That's the difference. And therefore, how am I going to get this inner sweetness and the answer is in verse 17.

It's which is the secret to the whole thing because gospel goodness has a higher view  of the law of God than any other kind of goodness. You see, Jesus Christ, I'm sure when he gets to this verse, he says, I bet you all are thinking  because I'm talking about God as if he's your father that you can be sure of his love  and acceptance, no matter who you are, no matter what you are. I'm sure you think I have a low view of the law. I have a higher view of the law than you do. He says, Christianity has a higher view of the law than religion.

Why? Well, there's two kinds of religion. I'll give you one kind. First of all, it's what I call liberal religion and liberal religion says, basically, God loves  everybody and you just try your best. Is that going to give you that inner sense of sweetness?

Is that going to make you absolutely and totally sure that God loves you utterly? Is that going to give you, are you going to be amazed at what God's done in order to  love you? No. Sentimental. That's liberal religion.

On the other hand, you've got conservative religion and conservative religion says, here's  the rules. Do it. Conservative religion knows your center, doesn't really know your love and liberal religion  knows your love, but it doesn't cost God anything to love you. But Jesus Christ comes along and says, I do not come to abolish the law, that's against  liberal religion. I come to fulfill it.

And that's against conservative religion. Why? What Jesus Christ, what does he mean when he says, I come to fulfill it? Well, look at this sermon on the Mount. First of all, he's the only one who ever lived this sermon on the Mount.

Go through this sermon on the Mount and you're amazed at the beauty of the character. Well, it's Jesus. Jesus is the only person who ever lived like this. But not only that, he didn't just fulfill most of the sermon on the Mount, he's fulfilled  to be attitudes. And here's how he fulfilled them.

Jesus said, Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy, but Jesus Christ, though  he was merciful, did not obtain mercy, he was condemned. Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God. And Jesus Christ, who was pure in heart, did not see God, but rather had his God turn  his face away from him on this cross. That's why he cried out, my God, my God, why has that turn my face away? Jesus says the meek on here at the earth, well, he was perfectly meek, absolutely meek,  but he was disenfranchised.

Blessed are those who hunger in thirst after righteousness, well, nobody hunger in thirst  after righteousness, like Jesus Christ, except he wasn't fulfilled. He was emptied out. He said, I thirst. Why? Here's why.

He, though he was meek, lost his inheritance, so you, though you're not meek, can get it. He, though, was pure in heart, didn't see God, so you and I, who are not pure in heart,  can. He, though he was merciful, obtained no mercy, so you and I, who are not merciful, can. Jesus Christ says, I have fulfilled the sermon on the Mount. I have utterly fulfilled it, and therefore when you believe in me, not only does everything  that you deserve come on to me, but everything I've done comes on to you, which means that  when God looks at you, Christian friends, brother, sister, he sees someone as beautiful  as someone who's doing the sermon on the Mount every day, absolutely every day.

That is high. That's a higher view of the law. Jesus Christ says, I take the law more seriously than any religious person, because there are  other religious people said, do your best and I say, no, you've got to be perfect, absolutely  perfect. I've been perfect for you, and that's the reason why you got that great hymn that I've  done. By John Newton, I'll say it twice as some of you've heard it 10 times before, where John  Newton says, to see the law by Christ fulfilled, and hear his pardoning voice, transforms  a slave into a child, and duty into choice.

To see the law by Christ fulfilled, and here is pardoning voice, transforms a slave  into a child, and duty into choice. Now, practical two or three things that were done. First of all, what does this mean? Have you seen all over New York, you go by the phone booth and the bus station stops  and you have all the ads, and this ad is a beautiful model in undergarments. And it says, inner beauty only goes so far.

Now, I'm going to say something just to get your attention so you can write it down so  I heard a press term minister say this. That's a damn lie. Damned. D-A-M-N-E-D. It is.

Absolutely. It's making fun of the values of the kingdom of God. You're never going to have the upside down kingdom, where instead of looking for power and  looking for success and looking for approval, you live a life of sacrifice, unless you have  the inside out kingdom, which says what really matters is what really matters is who I am  to Jesus and who I'm in my heart, and not whether I look right, and not what, in other  words, the wealth I need, the worth I need, see, the reputation I need is all wrapped up  in him. And that makes Christians radically free, we're not self-conscious, we're not scared about  our bank account. You're never going to live the upside down kingdom unless you have the inside out kingdom.

Secondly, and this is fairly important, verse 19 says, a Christian, one of the ways you  know you're a Christian is that you love to study the law of God and obey it. If you're a religious person, you're kind of scared of the word of God. And of course, if you're a relativistic person, you don't, you disdain the law of God. But the one of the ways you know that you're a believer and you've got gospel goodness  is as Psalm 1 says, the blessed is the Godly man, his delight is in the law of God, and on  it he meditates, day and night. In other words, one of the ways you can tell, you've got gospel goodness, is you're  love to have God tell you what to do.

You're delight in meditating and finding things where you can change. That's one of the best ways to know whether you really understand the gospel of grace. Because if you read the Bible and you read the sermon amount and you just feel terrible,  you say, oh my goodness, how the God ever loved me, you still don't get it. You still don't understand what Jesus means when He says, I came to fulfill it. You don't get it yet.

You're still stuck in a certain amount of religiosity. If you don't just love to have Him tell you what to do and tell you where you're wrong. If it doesn't give you delight instead just crushes you down, you still don't get it. It's a test. Lastly, if you're not sure whether you're a Christian or not, let me suggest something.

The sermon on the mount is not a horizontal bar. It's not a way to climb up to God. Do this and do this. No, it's a vertical bar. It says there's two ways.

One way is to say out of my goodness, I will seek to get God and other people to give  me what I need in inner emptiness. That is a feeling of approval, a feeling of worth, or you can say, I'm going to build my  whole life and my approach to God on what Jesus has done for me, but your own Savior or  let Him be your Savior. See, there's a vertical line. The sermon on the mount is not, here's a horizontal line, climb on up, no, choose to see  the law by Christ fulfilled and here is pardoning voice, transform the slave into a child. Let's pray.

Father, we thank you that you have shown us the difference in Christianity and religion. Now, we all need to see this, whether we're Christians, whether we're not Christians  or whether we're not sure what we are, if we're not sure what we are, if we're not sure  what we are, we need to know, understand this, and there's people in this room now that  are seeking to find out how to connect with you. I pray that they would learn what this means. I have come to fulfill the law of God. Father, some of us in this room who know that a lot of our goodness is religious, even  though we're Christians, and it's one of the reasons why we're just not reveling  in and rejoicing, rejoicing in Jesus' fulfillment of the law for us.

And as a result of that, we really don't delight in the law of God, and our prayer life  is filled with deadness, and we pray that you would help us to rejoice in the gospel  tonight in such a way that this week we are, we're conformed more into the likeness  of your Son and therefore, we live brighter, deeper, sweeter lives. Now, we pray all this in Jesus' name, amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today's teaching from the sermon on the Mount, Tim Keller shows how Christ offers  us practical guidance for living out a compelling vision of a new kind of community shaped  by grace. What are you? When people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because  of me. Rejoice and be glad because great is your reward in heaven. For in the same way, they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled by men. You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden, neither do people light up the lamp and put it under  a bowl.

Instead, they put it on its stand and give it light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before men that they may see your good deeds and  praise your Father in heaven. Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets. I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not  the least stroke of a pen, will be by any means disappear from the law until everything  is accomplished.

Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the  same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers  of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven. This is God's word. We're looking at the Sermon on the Mount because we're going to look for a number of weeks  at what it means to live the Christian life.

How is the Christian life concretely different when it's lived out? Now, last week when we looked at the first very first part of the Sermon on the Mount,  the Beatitudes and the woes, we saw that the Christian life is based on a very different  set of values in that of the world. And therefore, the first step in understanding the distinctiveness of the Christian life  is to notice that it's distinct, the Christianity's distinct from the world and what all that  means. We're not going back over that. That was last week.

But before you actually get into the specifics of Christian practice in the Sermon  on the Mount, there is another distinction that has to be made or you won't get Christianity. Another introductory general basic distinction because Christianity is not just different from  the world, Christianity is also distinct from religion. You see where it says Pharisees and teachers of the law, in fact every place it says Pharisees  and teachers of the law would help a lot if you just put in their religious leaders. And what Jesus is saying is Christianity is different than religion. Now this is key to understanding Christianity.

And it's a very helpful thing to think about this time of year. Swiss Theologian Karl Bart suggested this idea. He said there is an anti-Semitic way of speaking about the death of Jesus. As some people out of anti-Semitic bias and feelings say the Jews killed Jesus. And Karl Bart says not only is that anti-Semitic, but it's nonsense.

It doesn't help. It's not illuminating. He says imagine somebody saying the Greeks killed Socrates. Well you'd say okay well Socrates was Greek, his enemies were Greek, his friends were  Greek. Of course Greeks would be involved in the death of Socrates.

But that doesn't really, that's not specific and I wouldn't really tell me who killed Socrates  when you say Greeks killed Socrates. And the same way Jesus was a Jew and his friends were Jewish and his enemies were Jewish. So to say Jews killed Jesus. Of course Jews were involved. But it doesn't really, it's not specific and it doesn't really tell us who killed Jesus.

Karl Bart said who did kill Jesus? Religious people killed Jesus. He says not only do you see everywhere in the New Testament, a hostility by Jesus toward  religion. When Jesus gets near people from the world, when Jesus gets near worldly people, he's very  patient, very kind. When he gets near religious leaders, he's very sharp.

But on the other hand, it's religious people that were the most angry at what Jesus said  over and over and over again. The crowds, the Hoy Paloie, the common people of the world, they were fascinated with Jesus. Maybe they didn't believe what he said. But the religious people were angry. And the one of the main points of the New Testament is you're never going to get Christianity  unless you see that it is something utterly different than religion.

Not only that, it's not just a key to understanding Christianity, it's a key to understanding  the whole sermon on the mount. At the end of the sermon on the mount, both in its version we have in Luke, chapter 6, and  its version we have in Matthew 5 to 7, you have at the very end of the sermon on mount,  Jesus always ends by saying, now in summary and conclusion, I put before you these two  ways. Now, they're very famous statements. He says, there's two paths. One leads to life, one leads to destruction.

There are two trees, one has good fruit, but one has poison fruit. There's two houses, one is built on the rock and one is built on the sand. And what he's saying is, here you have two ways, two trees, two houses, two ways of life,  and on the surface they look very, very much the same. But one of the ways is poison. It poisons its eaters.

It destroys its travelers. It collapses on its residents. Now, what are those two ways? At the end of the sermon on the mount, what are the two ways that Jesus is putting in front  of us? Because it's not this tree, this tree.

Not this way, this way, not this house, this house. What are they? And traditionally, and I have to admit, I have done it too, as a preacher, traditionally,  people read that and say, oh, what Jesus is saying is, you can either live, according  to the sermon on the mount, you can live according to the law of God, the commandments of  God, you can either obey God's laws, or you can  disobey God's laws, see, life destruction, good fruit, bad fruit. You can either live obeying God's laws, or you can disobey God's laws. But a commentator changed my whole understanding of the sermon on the mount when he said, does  it make sense that Jesus Christ would say, in summary, there are these two ways, and they  look extremely alike, just that one of them has poison fruit, see, two houses, two ways,  two trees.

It makes sense that Jesus would talk about two ways at the conclusion of a sermon and  not have talked about those two ways in the sermon. Does it make sense if those two ways that he's putting in front of us, one of which he's  in joining, and one of which he's warning us against? Does it make sense that those two ways would be good and bad, people that obey God's law,  people who disobey God's law? Because how would those both be two trees that look alike? How would those both be two houses that look alike?

The commentator said, you've got to go back in and you go into the sermon on the mount,  and see if he has, is the sermon on the mount how to live? The Christian life simply is that it, or is the sermon on the mount contrasting these  two ways? Are the two ways in the sermon, and they are, but the scary thing is it's not what you think. When you go in there, you're not going to see Jesus says, here's the people who obey God's  law, and here's the people who don't. Never.

When you go through the sermon, here's what you see. First of all, you'll see him say, and this is a, we're going to get into this as the  week's going on, but he doesn't say, here's people who pray, and here's people who don't  pray. No. He says, you pray like this, but you should pray like this. He doesn't say, here's people that give to the poor, and here's people who don't give  to the poor.

No, he doesn't say that. He says, some people give to the poor like this, but I say, give like this. So they say, here's people who obey the 10 commandments, and here's people who don't. No. He says, you hear the 10 commandments, the commandment thou shalt not murder.

You obey like this, but I say obey like this. Here's what the scary thing is. In the sermon on the mount, Jesus Christ is contrasting two ways. One is not good, and the other bad, they're both good. In that, both groups of people are obeying the God's law.

Both groups of people are following the 10 commandments. Both groups of people are praying. Both groups of people are giving to the poor. Both groups of people are going to church, you know, worship. Both groups of people are studying the Bible.

And yet, one is poison. And you can see it right here in this very text. Look at verse 19. Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the  same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. Whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

Look at that. Notice both those groups of people in verse 19 are in the kingdom of heaven. Some are doing well, some are doing not so well, but they're both in. And then suddenly, verse 20, he says, however, there's the religious people, their righteousness,  they're not in the kingdom of heaven at all. He says, your righteousness must surpass their righteousness.

And what he's saying is not, they're good in your bad, or you're good in their bad,  but you're both trying to do the same thing. You're both trying to obey God. However, what here's what Jesus is saying, Christianity is vastly beyond its surpasses  religion. It's something utterly different than religion. That's what he's saying.

Don't mistake Christianity for religion. Don't mistake Christianity for going to worship and praying and giving to the poor. Don't mistake Christianity for that. You can do all that and be poisoned. On your way to destruction.

House on the sand. That's what he's saying. Now does that scare you? It should. I have been a poor communicator in these first few minutes.

Because surely, surely, people are saying you're kidding, right? I thought Christianity was about, you leave the Amal lifestyle and you try to live according  to the Bible in the example of Christ and the law of God, isn't that it? The answer is no. That's part of it. That's involved clearly, but that's to miss the point.

The key is Jesus says, if you want to be in the kingdom of heaven, there's a way. There's a gospel goodness that vastly surpasses religious righteousness. How does it surpass? Well, four ways and they build on each other. Gospel goodness surpasses religious righteousness in four ways.

It's brighter because it's deeper. It's deeper because it's sweeter. It's sweeter because it's higher. Gospel goodness surpasses because it's brighter and deeper and sweeter and higher. Number one, brighter.

I mean, literally, it says, you're the light of the world. Notice there's two groups of people here. There's people whose light doesn't say light and darkness. There's two groups of people doing good deeds. The one is doing it under a bowl and one's doing it in a way that the world is attracted and is delighted.

Therefore, the first difference between gospel goodness and religious righteousness,  the first way for you to be able to tell the difference is in this relationship to the world. Christianity is attracted to and attractive to. Hear that? I'm sorry, I don't know if I can get this through. Christianity is attracted to ED at the end and attractive to IVE at the end.

People who you don't agree with, people who don't live the way you do,  people who don't believe what you believe. Christianity is attracted to and attractive to but religious people are turned off by,  you see, and they are very, very, very alienating to people who disagree with them. Now here's what I mean, let's press this. First of all, Christians are attracted. Notice where it says, they are salt.

You are the salt of the earth. Now, what is salt? Back in those days, the main thing salt did was a preservative. You didn't put salt into water because water doesn't go bad. You put salt into meat because meat's going bad.

It's falling apart unless you put salt in it. And what this is telling us is Christians by the nature of what their Christianity,  when they see things falling apart, they get in there. When you see somebody emotionally falling apart, you go in like salt. When you see a neighborhood socially or economically falling apart, you go in. Christians are attracted, deeds of love and mercy, in their salt.

Religious people, however, they're under a bull. What does that mean? Well, it means that they really want to stick together. They don't like being out there with all those people that differ. They're not at all attracted to neighborhoods that are falling apart.

They're not at all attracted to people that are falling apart. They look around and they pull their skirts in. That's the difference between religiousness and Christianity. But not only that, Christians are not just attracted to,  but they're attractive to people who disagree with them and who live a very different life  and don't believe what they believe. Because notice, not only do you have the idea of light, beautiful light, but again, salt  has another side to it.

The other job of salt was not just to be a preservative. It was also to make something taste good. Now, not about you, for example, I can't stand corn in the cobweb without salt on it. But when I have eaten a piece of corn in the cob that I really like, I put it down and  what do I say? Do I say, honey?

That was great salt. No, you said that was great corn in the cob. Why? Because the job of salt is not to make you think how great the salt is, but how great the  thing is that it's involved with. I mean, we push this along.

What if you're salt in your small group Bible study? Well, if you're salt, people won't go away saying, boy, that person really, really knows  the Bible had all the answers, showed me up. No, what happens is when you go away from a small group in which you've been to salt,  people don't go away saying, how great that person, they go away saying, what a great  group. Now, this is pretty simple. See, salt makes you feel better about what you, in other words, the Christians make  you feel better, religious people always make you feel condemned, make you feel worse.

And you have this place in chapter 7, a little later on in this terminal amount that  you have a very famous place. Again, you can see right away, Jesus contrasting it two ways. He says, judge not, let's you be judged. He says, you hypocrites, if you don't take a speck out of your brother's eye and miss  the plank in your own eye, now what's all that about? Some people have said, well, that means you're not supposed to make moral evaluations.

You're not supposed to try to persuade people that your religion is right. It's judging. Now, of course, that's not true. Why? Because to say, you mustn't make moral evaluations, is to make a moral evaluation, and to say you  must not persuade people that your religious point of view is right, is to persuade that  person that your religious point of view is right, which means it's impossible not to make  it moral evaluations.

How do we impossible? As soon as you say, let's not do it, you've just done it. You have to do it in order to deny it. You have to use it. In order to even say, I'm not going to do it.

What is Jesus saying, then? Judging is doing moral evaluations with superiority or, let me press it, the Christian is somebody  who always sees your own sin as a speck, as a plank, and the sins of other people as specks,  religious people always see their own sins as specks, and everybody else as sins as a plank. That's the reason why religious people always make you feel worse, they make you feel condemned,  and the reason why Christianity is salt and white. Now, by the way, quick caveat before we move on, I didn't say Christianity, beliefs are  popular. Oh, my goodness, no.

I'm not saying that. When I say the gospel goodness is attractive and attracting, I'm saying gospel goodness. I'm not saying the gospel. Gospel is still very repugnant to people. As soon as you open your mouth about what you believe, you'll get some trouble.

Here's the difference. If you have gospel goodness in you, you never, ever, ever act or feel superior to anybody  else, especially the people who are different from you. This is the reason, by the way, why your attitude toward New York City is one of the best  ways to tell whether you're a Christian or a religious person. Because when you take a look at New York City, you're going to see two things. First of all, you're going to see some things falling apart, and religious people say who  wants to live in there, which shows you have no saltiness at all.

They're going to say, in other words, religious people look around and say, what's wrong  with these people? And see, which of course is my sin is a speck, your sin is a plank. And not only that, when you take a look around New York City, one of the things you can see  right off the bat, you can see them just walking out. You can look at some people and say, here's somebody who does not obey the ten commandments. It's not that hard to see.

And Christians aren't turned off by that. And religious people totally are. So the first point is, gospel goodness is brighter. It's attractive. You say, why?

Well, let's move on. Because, secondly, gospel goodness is deeper. And here we're not talking about the relationship with the world. We're talking about a relationship with your own heart. When Jesus Christ said in verse 20, I tell you that unless your righteousness or passes  that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom  of heaven.

When he said that, he knew that everybody must have just been utterly incredibly amazed. Because the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were basically full-time, they did  full-time obedience. That was their job. They had divided, you know, they worked out the Bible into something like 635 laws. And they just, they had the checklist.

They had positive laws and they had negative laws, things you had to do, things you were  supposed to avoid. And they just spent all day working on it. And when Jesus Christ says, you know, your righteousness has to surpass. Right away, people must have said, how could that be? Oh, and the world could be more righteous than the scribes and the teachers of the law and  the Pharisees.

And actually the answer is kind of weird because you see, it's a little bit like saying,  here's this river and it's a mile wide. And when Jesus says you have to surpass the river, it doesn't necessarily mean you've  got to go that way. Maybe he means you've got to go this way. Maybe the river is a mile wide, but it's only an inch deep. And therefore, as soon as he says verse 20, the next few verses immediately show Jesus  is answering the questions that he knew would be right in people's minds.

What does he mean when he says you have to surpass? Well, in verse 21, 27, 31, 33, 43 in other words, over and over and over again. He says, you've heard that I say. And he goes through the 10 commandments. You've heard, now shall not murder.

You've heard that shall not commit adultery. You've heard it said, now shall keep thy promises not lie. Keep your oath. He's gone to the 10 commandments. So what is he doing?

In every case he says, you're concerned, you religious people are concerned with the  external, I'm concerned with the heart. You can have the external and the heartbeat just like everybody else in the world. But if your heart is a different, is completely new, then you'll have the external too. Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer? Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith?

For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding  of what it means to follow Christ. A great resource to start using this summer is the new city-catechism devotional, God's  truth for our hearts and minds. This devotional brings the historic catechisms of the Christian Church to life, offering a question  to consider for each week of the year. In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catechesis, the rich and communal  practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers that frame the foundational beliefs  of the Christian faith. Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer, and a brief meditation that will challenge  and inspire you.

The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller, and  Kevin D. Young, as well as historical figures such as Augustine, John Calvin, and Martin  Luther. This month, in addition to the new city-catechism devotional, we are including a great  companion resource, the new city-catechism for kids, as our thank you for your gift,  to help gospel and life share the hope of Christ's love with people all over the world. So request your copies today at gospelonlife.com-slashgive, that's gospelonlife.com-slashgive. Now here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching.

Now here's what he does, let me show you, you know, it's just this sort of thing will  make you sink in your pews. He says, okay, let's take a look at murder. You've heard it said that I'll show a lot murder. Religious people are concerned about not physically murdering somebody, but I say unto you. He says, if in your heart you have ill will, if you despise them, if you think of people  as fools, if you disdain them, if you're indifferent to them, you've killed them.

And then he was on a sex, says, you've heard it said I'll show a committed adultery. Now, you know, the Christian sex ethic is no sex outside marriage. Well, what is that all about? Well, here's what it's about, which Jesus shows you when you have sex outside marriage,  what you're doing is you're saying, I want to have physical, external, nakedness and vulnerability,  but I don't want to give you personal nakedness and vulnerability. In other words, let's be naked physically, but I don't want to actually give myself to you  in every other way.

I don't want to get married to you. I don't want to give up my independence. I don't want to give up my options. I don't want to really give my, in other words, I don't want to back up physical nakedness  and vulnerability with actual personal, complete nakedness and vulnerability. I don't want to do that.

And Jesus Christ says, when you ask for physical nakedness and you don't have the integrity  or the guts to back it up with personal, in other words, if you're not willing to put  your whole heart there, it says that's lust. And when you do that, even in fantasy, you're stabbing yourself in the heart. Then he goes on to truth. And he says, you've heard it said that if you've taken oath, you better stick with the oath. But he says, again, that's all external.

In other words, you've signed a contract. And if you break the contract, the lawyers will come after you. And this and that sort of thing. He says, I say unto you, let your yes be yes and let your no be known. What does he mean?

What he means is your heart should be so full of integrity  that every single thing you say, every yes and every no  should be taken as seriously by you as if you just swore on a stack of Bibles  because external consequences should mean nothing. In other words, he goes on and on and on all the way through when he talks about turning the other cheek. You know, or don't pay back. He says, you may not be paying back physically, but I say unto you, turn the other cheek,  what does turn the other cheek? We'll get to that later this spring, but basically what does turn the other cheek?

Turn the other cheek means not just you refrain from paying back,  but you're still hoping for a relationship. You're still hoping, you're hoping for that person. You want him someday to kiss you. That's why you turn the other cheek. You don't turn the other cheek in order to get hit.

That's another sermon. But see, the whole point of turning other cheek is Jesus says, don't you dare just refrain  from vengeance externally. I don't just ask for that. I say to you, when you look at a person who's wronged you, no matter how messed up  and no matter how vicious they've been, you need to treat them with hope. You need to treat them with forgiveness.

If you're going to oppose them, you should never oppose them except in love and good will. Now, by the time you get to the end of this whole section, you're kind of like a massive  smoking wreckage. You're sitting here like this and you started to say, listen, Buddha, Confucius, Muhammad,  any teacher of ethics, there's never been a teacher who's asked for this. Never. Never a teacher who's wanted to go this deep.

You see in a way, verse 20 is easy. He says, you have to surpass the scribes and the Pharisees and the Jews of the Law. He says, you have to surpass the religious people. What he really means is, I want you to have your heart changed and religion only worries  about the externals. And you have an awful lot of people who are doing the law, you know, they're not committing  adultery and they're not killing and they're not paying back and they're telling the truth.

But they're doing it exactly the way the world does out of fear and out of pride. He's like, here's a religious person and they say, I tell the truth. And here's a worldly person and they're cheating everywhere and they're lying and they're  doing all this stuff. Oh, the religious person says, I don't lie. I'm not like them.

Well, now why is that worldly person cheating and lying? A, fear. One of the reasons you lie is you say, oh my goodness, I might lose my money, I might  lose my reputation. Fear. The other is pride.

You say, I'm going to get them. I'm going to pull a number on them. Fear and pride lead them to lie. Why does a religious person not lie? Why does a religious person tell the truth?

Why? Here's what Jesus says, fear and pride. Either you say, I'm not going to lie because God will get me, boy, better not lie. He's going to get ahold of me. He's going to take me out.

In the other possible way, religious people say, I'm not going to lie, why? Because I'm not like those kinds of people that lie. I'm not a liar. I'm a good person. So at a fear and at a pride, you don't lie.

And over here, at a fear and at a pride, they do lie. And Jesus says, what's the difference? See, one kind of goodness, a selfish goodness. Religious goodness is selfish goodness. It's trying to get leverage.

It's trying to say, if I lie, if I tell the truth, then God will have to be good to me. If I tell the truth, then I can feel superior to other people. This is the reason why religious goodness is so alienating and this is the reason it's  so shallow. Hmm. And that's the reason why that's the reason why gospel goodness is brighter because it's  deeper.

Okay. Then why is it so deep? And here's the answer. Thirdly, because it's sweeter. Gospel goodness has a center of sweetness.

There's something that's happened in the center. The good news about the sermon on the Mount is this. When you read through carefully, you will see that Jesus Christ does not say, try to live  like this and then God will be your father. Oh, no. All the way through here, he says, you can live like this if you already know God's your  father.

Look at verse 16. He says, why are you going to be able to let your light shine? Why are you going to have an attitude toward the world that's non-condescending? Why are you going to love people to disagree with you? Why are you going to be light?

Why are you going to be bright? Because God's your father. Where let me go deeper into the sermon. He in, not out into my sermon, the sermon on the Mount, I'm already very deep into the  sermon. In chapter 6, this is a fascinating place where Jesus says, don't worry, have no anxiety  about anything.

And you say, what, what kind of command is that? How can I stop worrying? How can I stop worrying? And if you treat this religiously, of course, you're going to say, I guess I've got to stop  worrying. How do I do that?

What I got to. And Jesus says, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, he says, he says, have  not an anxiety about these things. Don't you see God taking care of the birds? Don't you see God taking care of the lilies of the field? Don't you know that your heavenly father, if he cares for them, don't you know how much  more valuable you are than them?

Now here's what Jesus is showing us. The sermon on the Mount is impossible unless you know you're valuable. Jesus sums it. And the difference between religion and Christianity is this. Religion obeys the law of God unto value, trying to get value.

In chapter 6 it says the reason you give to the poor is so people will honor you. In chapter 6 it says the reason that you pray is to get God to listen to you for your many  words. See, a religious person is trying to get value, a religious person is saying, if I do all  these good things, then God will have to listen to me and then people will honor me. You are trying to get value and that's the reason why you're alienating. That's the reason why deep inside you're filled with fear and pride.

But gospel is obeying God's law out of value, not unto, not seeking value, but because  you know. That's amazing. In other words, unless there's a center of sweetness, unless there's this incredible  inner sweetness, a knowledge that you are of incredible value to him, there's  nothing he would do. You know, he was nothing he would not do in order to hold on to you and keep you. He's a father, not a boss.

If you're an employee and you're good, you've got a boss. And if you're bad and you disobey the laws, you're fired. But if you're a child and you've got a father or a mother and you're good, you've got  a father or mother and you're bad, you've got a grumpy father or mother but you've got  a father or mother. In fact, oh, fathers and mothers, you know something, don't you? And that is, this is something very weird that if you've got three children, my guy do,  and one of those being disobedient, so often the disobedient one has your heart the most.

Why? It's the nature of parenthood. And when Jesus comes along and says, the secret of the difference between good gospel goodness  and religious righteousness is that you have got as a father. That happens before you can obey. It's not something you obey in order to get.

It's something you obey because of. When you know God as your father, when you have that center of sweetness, changes everything. See, religious people, for example, never do anything unless it's about them. Why do you help a little lady across the street? It's not about her, it's about you.

Maybe God will answer your prayers and you'll feel like a pretty good person. See? Why do you help the poor? It's not about the poor. It's about you.

It's the reason why very often the religious people's help over the poor is so condescending  and so ineffective because it's filled with superiority. Why does a religious person pray? It's about you. It's not for him. That's the reason why your prayers are filled with petition and very little adoration and  repentance.

Therefore, you see, you're brighter. It's brighter because it's deeper, it's deeper because it's sweeter and it's sweeter  why, finally, how do you become a child of God? How is it possible that you could know that he's your father? See, somebody out here is saying, well, wait a minute, isn't God the father of everybody? God is the father of all people.

And what Jesus is saying is, well, yes, in one sense, but not in a sense I'm talking  about because he says knowing God as your father is the heart of what makes you a Christian  rather than a religious person. And not being sure about God's love and not being sure who you are and not being sure  is the heart of religiosity. And using goodness, really, it's about you. It's not about the people around you or God. It's leverage goodness.

I do it to get leverage. It's manipulative goodness. I do it in order to get people in God to do the things I want. That's the difference. And therefore, how am I going to get this inner sweetness and the answer is in verse 17.

It's which is the secret to the whole thing because gospel goodness has a higher view  of the law of God than any other kind of goodness. You see, Jesus Christ, I'm sure when he gets to this verse, he says, I bet you all are thinking  because I'm talking about God as if he's your father that you can be sure of his love  and acceptance, no matter who you are, no matter what you are. I'm sure you think I have a low view of the law. I have a higher view of the law than you do. He says, Christianity has a higher view of the law than religion.

Why? Well, there's two kinds of religion. I'll give you one kind. First of all, it's what I call liberal religion and liberal religion says, basically, God loves  everybody and you just try your best. Is that going to give you that inner sense of sweetness?

Is that going to make you absolutely and totally sure that God loves you utterly? Is that going to give you, are you going to be amazed at what God's done in order to  love you? No. Sentimental. That's liberal religion.

On the other hand, you've got conservative religion and conservative religion says, here's  the rules. Do it. Conservative religion knows your center, doesn't really know your love and liberal religion  knows your love, but it doesn't cost God anything to love you. But Jesus Christ comes along and says, I do not come to abolish the law, that's against  liberal religion. I come to fulfill it.

And that's against conservative religion. Why? What Jesus Christ, what does he mean when he says, I come to fulfill it? Well, look at this sermon on the Mount. First of all, he's the only one who ever lived this sermon on the Mount.

Go through this sermon on the Mount and you're amazed at the beauty of the character. Well, it's Jesus. Jesus is the only person who ever lived like this. But not only that, he didn't just fulfill most of the sermon on the Mount, he's fulfilled  to be attitudes. And here's how he fulfilled them.

Jesus said, Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy, but Jesus Christ, though  he was merciful, did not obtain mercy, he was condemned. Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God. And Jesus Christ, who was pure in heart, did not see God, but rather had his God turn  his face away from him on this cross. That's why he cried out, my God, my God, why has that turn my face away? Jesus says the meek on here at the earth, well, he was perfectly meek, absolutely meek,  but he was disenfranchised.

Blessed are those who hunger in thirst after righteousness, well, nobody hunger in thirst  after righteousness, like Jesus Christ, except he wasn't fulfilled. He was emptied out. He said, I thirst. Why? Here's why.

He, though he was meek, lost his inheritance, so you, though you're not meek, can get it. He, though, was pure in heart, didn't see God, so you and I, who are not pure in heart,  can. He, though he was merciful, obtained no mercy, so you and I, who are not merciful, can. Jesus Christ says, I have fulfilled the sermon on the Mount. I have utterly fulfilled it, and therefore when you believe in me, not only does everything  that you deserve come on to me, but everything I've done comes on to you, which means that  when God looks at you, Christian friends, brother, sister, he sees someone as beautiful  as someone who's doing the sermon on the Mount every day, absolutely every day.

That is high. That's a higher view of the law. Jesus Christ says, I take the law more seriously than any religious person, because there are  other religious people said, do your best and I say, no, you've got to be perfect, absolutely  perfect. I've been perfect for you, and that's the reason why you got that great hymn that I've  done. By John Newton, I'll say it twice as some of you've heard it 10 times before, where John  Newton says, to see the law by Christ fulfilled, and hear his pardoning voice, transforms  a slave into a child, and duty into choice.

To see the law by Christ fulfilled, and here is pardoning voice, transforms a slave  into a child, and duty into choice. Now, practical two or three things that were done. First of all, what does this mean? Have you seen all over New York, you go by the phone booth and the bus station stops  and you have all the ads, and this ad is a beautiful model in undergarments. And it says, inner beauty only goes so far.

Now, I'm going to say something just to get your attention so you can write it down so  I heard a press term minister say this. That's a damn lie. Damned. D-A-M-N-E-D. It is.

Absolutely. It's making fun of the values of the kingdom of God. You're never going to have the upside down kingdom, where instead of looking for power and  looking for success and looking for approval, you live a life of sacrifice, unless you have  the inside out kingdom, which says what really matters is what really matters is who I am  to Jesus and who I'm in my heart, and not whether I look right, and not what, in other  words, the wealth I need, the worth I need, see, the reputation I need is all wrapped up  in him. And that makes Christians radically free, we're not self-conscious, we're not scared about  our bank account. You're never going to live the upside down kingdom unless you have the inside out kingdom.

Secondly, and this is fairly important, verse 19 says, a Christian, one of the ways you  know you're a Christian is that you love to study the law of God and obey it. If you're a religious person, you're kind of scared of the word of God. And of course, if you're a relativistic person, you don't, you disdain the law of God. But the one of the ways you know that you're a believer and you've got gospel goodness  is as Psalm 1 says, the blessed is the Godly man, his delight is in the law of God, and on  it he meditates, day and night. In other words, one of the ways you can tell, you've got gospel goodness, is you're  love to have God tell you what to do.

You're delight in meditating and finding things where you can change. That's one of the best ways to know whether you really understand the gospel of grace. Because if you read the Bible and you read the sermon amount and you just feel terrible,  you say, oh my goodness, how the God ever loved me, you still don't get it. You still don't understand what Jesus means when He says, I came to fulfill it. You don't get it yet.

You're still stuck in a certain amount of religiosity. If you don't just love to have Him tell you what to do and tell you where you're wrong. If it doesn't give you delight instead just crushes you down, you still don't get it. It's a test. Lastly, if you're not sure whether you're a Christian or not, let me suggest something.

The sermon on the mount is not a horizontal bar. It's not a way to climb up to God. Do this and do this. No, it's a vertical bar. It says there's two ways.

One way is to say out of my goodness, I will seek to get God and other people to give  me what I need in inner emptiness. That is a feeling of approval, a feeling of worth, or you can say, I'm going to build my  whole life and my approach to God on what Jesus has done for me, but your own Savior or  let Him be your Savior. See, there's a vertical line. The sermon on the mount is not, here's a horizontal line, climb on up, no, choose to see  the law by Christ fulfilled and here is pardoning voice, transform the slave into a child. Let's pray.

Father, we thank you that you have shown us the difference in Christianity and religion. Now, we all need to see this, whether we're Christians, whether we're not Christians  or whether we're not sure what we are, if we're not sure what we are, if we're not sure  what we are, we need to know, understand this, and there's people in this room now that  are seeking to find out how to connect with you. I pray that they would learn what this means. I have come to fulfill the law of God. Father, some of us in this room who know that a lot of our goodness is religious, even  though we're Christians, and it's one of the reasons why we're just not reveling  in and rejoicing, rejoicing in Jesus' fulfillment of the law for us.

And as a result of that, we really don't delight in the law of God, and our prayer life  is filled with deadness, and we pray that you would help us to rejoice in the gospel  tonight in such a way that this week we are, we're conformed more into the likeness  of your Son and therefore, we live brighter, deeper, sweeter lives. Now, we pray all this in Jesus' name, amen.

这是神的话语。

我们在研读登山宝训，因为我们将在接下来的几周里探讨活出基督徒生活意味着什么。当基督徒的生活被活出来时，它在具体上有什么不同？

上周，当我们看登山宝训最开始的部分，就是八福和祸时，我们看到基督徒的生活是建立在与世界完全不同的价值观之上的。因此，理解基督徒生活独特性的第一步是注意到它是独特的，基督教与世界是不同的，以及这一切意味着什么。我们不再回顾那个，那是上周的内容。

但在你真正进入登山宝训中基督徒实践的具体内容之前，还有另一个区分必须做出，否则你就不会理解基督教。另一个介绍性的、一般性的、基本的区分，因为基督教不仅与世界不同，基督教也与宗教不同。你看到它说法利赛人和律法教师的地方，事实上每个说法利赛人和律法教师的地方，如果你把它换成宗教领袖会帮助很多。耶稣说的是基督教与宗教不同。这是理解基督教的关键。

在每年的这个时候思考这个问题是很有帮助的。瑞士神学家卡尔·巴特提出了这个想法。他说有一种反犹太主义的方式来谈论耶稣的死。有些人出于反犹太主义的偏见和情感说犹太人杀死了耶稣。卡尔·巴特说，这不仅是反犹太主义的，而且是胡说八道。它没有帮助。它没有启发性。他说，想象一下有人说希腊人杀死了苏格拉底。你会说，好吧，苏格拉底是希腊人，他的敌人是希腊人，他的朋友是希腊人。当然希腊人会参与苏格拉底的死。但那并不真正，那不具体，当你说希腊人杀死了苏格拉底时，我不会真正知道是谁杀死了苏格拉底。同样，耶稣是犹太人，他的朋友是犹太人，他的敌人是犹太人。所以说犹太人杀死了耶稣。当然犹太人参与了。但那并不真正，那不具体，它并不真正告诉我们谁杀死了耶稣。

卡尔·巴特说，谁真正杀死了耶稣？宗教人士杀死了耶稣。他说，你不仅在新约中到处看到耶稣对宗教的敌意。当耶稣接近来自世界的人时，当耶稣接近世俗的人时，他非常有耐心，非常仁慈。当他接近宗教领袖时，他非常尖锐。但另一方面，宗教人士对耶稣一遍又一遍说的话最愤怒。群众，普通老百姓，来自世界的普通人，他们被耶稣迷住了。也许他们不相信他说的话。但宗教人士很愤怒。新约的主要观点之一是，除非你看到基督教与宗教是完全不同的东西，否则你永远不会理解基督教。

不仅如此，这不仅是理解基督教的关键，也是理解整个登山宝训的关键。在登山宝训的结尾，无论是在路加福音第六章的版本，还是在马太福音五到七章的版本中，在登山宝训的最后，耶稣总是这样结束：现在总结和结论，我把这两条道路放在你们面前。

这些是非常著名的陈述。他说，有两条路。一条通向生命，一条通向毁灭。有两棵树，一棵结好果子，但一棵结毒果。有两座房子，一座建在磐石上，一座建在沙土上。他说的是，这里有两条路，两棵树，两座房子，两种生活方式，表面上它们看起来非常、非常相似。但其中一条路是有毒的。它毒害吃它的人。它毁灭走它的人。它在居住者身上倒塌。

那两条路是什么呢？在登山宝训的结尾，耶稣放在我们面前的两条路是什么？因为不是这棵树、那棵树。不是这条路、那条路，不是这座房子、那座房子。它们是什么？传统上，我必须承认，我作为一个传道人也这样做过，传统上人们读那个说，哦，耶稣是在说，你可以选择按照登山宝训生活，你可以按照神的律法生活，按照神的诫命生活，你可以选择遵守神的律法，或者你可以不遵守神的律法，看，生命、毁灭，好果子、坏果子。你可以选择遵守神的律法，或者你可以不遵守神的律法。

但一位评论家改变了我对登山宝训的整个理解，他说，耶稣基督说，总结一下，有这两条路，它们看起来极其相似，只是其中一条有毒果，看，两座房子，两条路，两棵树，这有意义吗？耶稣会在讲道的结论中谈论两条路，而在讲道中没有谈论这两条路，这有意义吗？如果他放在我们面前的这两条路，一条他在劝勉，一条他在警告我们，如果这两条路是善良和邪恶，是遵守神律法的人和不遵守神律法的人，这有意义吗？因为那两者怎么会是看起来相似的两棵树呢？那两者怎么会是看起来相似的两座房子呢？

那位评论家说，你得回去看看登山宝训，看看登山宝训是否只是如何生活？基督徒生活就是那样吗？还是登山宝训在对比这两条路？这两条路在讲道中吗？它们确实在，但可怕的是它不是你想的那样。当你进去，你不会看到耶稣说，这是遵守神律法的人，这是不遵守的人。从来没有。

当你通读讲道，你会看到什么。首先，你会看到他说，这是，我们要在接下来的几周讨论这个，但他没有说，这是祷告的人，这是不祷告的人。不是。他说，你这样祷告，但你应该这样祷告。他没有说，这是给穷人施舍的人，这是不给穷人施舍的人。不是，他没有那样说。他说，有些人这样给穷人施舍，但我说，要这样给。所以他们说，这是遵守十诫的人，这是不遵守的人。不是。他说，你们听见有话说不可杀人。你这样遵守，但我说要这样遵守。

这是可怕的事情。在登山宝训中，耶稣基督在对比两条路。一条不是善，另一条是恶，它们都是善。因为两组人都在遵守神的律法。两组人都在遵守十诫。两组人都在祷告。两组人都在给穷人施舍。两组人都在去教会，你知道，敬拜。两组人都在研读圣经。然而，一条是有毒的。

你可以就在这段经文中看到。看第19节。凡废掉这诫命中最小一条又教训人这样做的，他在天国要称为最小的。凡遵行这诫命又教训人遵行的，他在天国要称为大的。看那个。注意第19节中这两组人都在天国里。有些做得好，有些做得不好，但他们都在里面。然后突然，第20节，他说，然而，有宗教人士，他们的义，他们根本不在天国里。他说，你们的义必须超过他们的义。

他说的不是他们善良而你们邪恶，或你们善良而他们邪恶，而是你们都在试图做同样的事。你们都在试图遵守神。然而，这就是耶稣在说的，基督教远远超过它超越宗教。它与宗教是完全不同的东西。这就是他在说的。不要把基督教误认为是宗教。不要把基督教误认为是去敬拜、祷告和给穷人施舍。不要把基督教误认为是那些。你可以做所有那些却被毒害。在走向毁灭的路上。房子建在沙土上。这就是他在说的。

这吓到你了吗？应该的。如果在头几分钟我没有沟通好。因为肯定，肯定，人们在说你在开玩笑吧？我以为基督教是关于离开不道德的生活方式，试图按照圣经和基督的榜样和神的律法生活，不是这样吗？答案是不是。那是其中一部分。那显然是涉及的，但那是错过了要点。关键是耶稣说，如果你想进入天国，有一条路。有一种福音的良善远远超过宗教的义。它如何超越？有四种方式，它们是层层递进的。福音的良善以四种方式超越宗教的义。它更明亮是因为它更深刻。它更深刻是因为它更甜美。它更甜美是因为它更高。福音的良善超越是因为它更明亮、更深刻、更甜美、更高。

第一，更明亮。我的意思是，字面上，它说，你们是世上的光。注意这里有两组人。有些人的光不是说光明和黑暗。有两组人在行善。一个是在斗底下做，一个是以一种吸引世界并使之喜悦的方式做。因此，福音的良善和宗教的义之间的第一个区别，你能分辨区别的第一种方式是在与世界的关系上。基督教被吸引并且吸引人。听到了吗？对不起，我不知道能不能传达清楚。基督教被吸引，ED结尾，并且吸引人，IVE结尾。你不同意的人，不像你那样生活的人，不相信你所相信的人。基督教被吸引并且吸引人，但宗教人士被排斥，你看，他们对不同意他们的人非常、非常、非常疏远。

让我解释一下我的意思。首先，基督徒被吸引。注意它说，他们是盐。你们是世上的盐。盐是什么？在那个时代，盐主要做的是防腐剂。你不把盐放进水里，因为水不会变坏。你把盐放进肉里，因为肉会变坏。除非你放盐，否则它会腐烂。这告诉我们的是，基督徒因着他们基督教的本质，当他们看到事物崩溃时，他们就进去。当你看到有人情绪崩溃时，你像盐一样进去。当你看到一个社区在社会或经济上崩溃时，你进去。基督徒被吸引，爱和怜悯的行为，在他们的盐中。

然而，宗教人士在斗底下。那是什么意思？这意味着他们真的想聚在一起。他们不喜欢在外面和所有那些不同的人在一起。他们完全不被正在崩溃的社区所吸引。他们完全不被正在崩溃的人所吸引。他们看看周围就缩回去。这就是宗教和基督教的区别。

但不仅如此，基督徒不仅被吸引，而且对不同意他们、过着非常不同生活、不相信他们所相信的人有吸引力。因为注意，你不仅有光的概念，美丽的光，而且盐还有另一面。盐的另一个作用不仅是防腐剂。它也是让东西味道好。

关于你，例如，我不能忍受没有盐的玉米棒。但当我吃了一根我真正喜欢的玉米棒，我放下来会说什么？我会说，亲爱的？那是很棒的盐。不，你说那是很棒的玉米棒。为什么？因为盐的作用不是让你想盐有多棒，而是让你想它参与的东西有多棒。我的意思是，我们继续说。如果你是你小组查经中的盐呢？如果你是盐，人们离开后不会说，哇，那个人真的很懂圣经，有所有的答案，让我相形见绌。不，当你离开一个你是盐的小组时，人们离开后不会说，那个人多棒，他们会说，多棒的小组。

这很简单。看，盐让你对你感觉更好，换句话说，基督徒让你感觉更好，宗教人士总是让你感觉被定罪，让你感觉更糟。你在第七章有这个地方，在这个登山宝训的后面一点，有一个非常著名的地方。同样，你可以立即看到，耶稣在对比两条路。他说，你们不要论断人，免得你们被论断。他说，你们这假冒为善的人，如果你不先去掉自己眼中的梁木却要去掉弟兄眼中的刺，那是什么意思？有人说，那意味着你不应该做道德评价。你不应该试图说服人你的宗教是对的。那是论断。

当然，那不是真的。为什么？因为说你不应该做道德评价，就是做道德评价，说你不应该说服人你的宗教观点是对的，就是在说服那个人你的宗教观点是对的，这意味着不做道德评价是不可能的。怎么不可能？你一说，我们不要做那个，你就刚做了。你必须做才能否认它。你必须使用它。为了说，我不会做那个。

那耶稣在说什么呢？论断是带着优越感做道德评价，或者，让我再说一下，基督徒总是把自己的罪看作梁木，把别人的罪看作刺，宗教人士总是把自己的罪看作刺，把别人的罪看作梁木。这就是为什么宗教人士总是让你感觉更糟，让你感觉被定罪，也是为什么基督教是盐和白色的原因。

顺便说一句，在继续之前有个小提醒，我没有说基督教的信仰是流行的。哦，天哪，不是。我不是在说那个。当我说福音的良善是有吸引力和被吸引的，我说的是福音的良善。我不是在说福音。福音对人们来说仍然是令人厌恶的。你一开口谈论你相信的，你就会遇到麻烦。

这是区别。如果你有福音的良善在你里面，你永远、永远、永远不会对任何人表现出或感到优越，特别是对与你不同的人。这就是为什么，顺便说一句，你对纽约市的态度是判断你是基督徒还是宗教人士的最好方法之一。因为当你看纽约市，你会看到两件事。首先，你会看到一些事物在崩溃，宗教人士说谁想住在那里，这表明你一点盐味都没有。他们会说，换句话说，宗教人士看看周围说，这些人怎么了？你看，那当然是我的罪是刺，你的罪是梁木。

不仅如此，当你看纽约市，你能立刻看到的一件事，你只要走出去就能看到。你可以看着一些人说，这个人不遵守十诫。这不难看到。基督徒不会被那个排斥。而宗教人士完全会。所以第一点是，福音的良善更明亮。它有吸引力。你说，为什么？让我们继续。因为，第二，福音的良善更深刻。这里我们不是在谈论与世界的关系。我们在谈论与你自己内心的关系。

当耶稣基督在第20节说，我告诉你们，除非你们的义胜过文士和法利赛人的义，你们断不能进天国。当他说那话时，他知道每个人一定完全惊呆了。因为法利赛人和律法教师基本上是全职的，他们做全职顺服。那是他们的工作。他们把圣经分成大约635条律法。他们只是，他们有清单。他们有积极的律法和消极的律法，你必须做的事，你应该避免的事。他们整天都在做这个。当耶稣基督说，你知道，你们的义必须超过。立刻，人们一定会说，这怎么可能？哦，世界上怎么可能比文士、律法教师和法利赛人更义。

实际上答案有点奇怪，因为你看，这有点像说，这条河一英里宽。当耶稣说你必须超过这条河，那不一定意味着你得往那个方向走。也许他的意思是你得往这个方向走。也许河一英里宽，但只有一英寸深。因此，他一说第20节，接下来的几节立刻显示耶稣在回答他知道会在人们心中的问题。他说超过是什么意思呢？

在第21、27、31、33、43节，换句话说，一遍又一遍。他说，你们听见有话说。他通过十诫。你们听见有话说不可杀人。你们听见有话说不可奸淫。你们听见有话说不可背誓。他通过十诫。所以他在做什么？在每种情况下他说，你们宗教人士关心的是外在的，我关心的是内心。你可以有外在而内心和世界上其他人一样。但如果你的内心是不同的，是全新的，那你也会有外在。

你在寻找今年夏天增长信心的方法吗？或者你希望帮助新信徒或孩子抓住基督教信仰的核心？对我们许多人来说，夏季月份可以提供更多时间加深我们的信仰和对跟随基督意味着什么的理解。今年夏天开始使用的一个很好的资源是新城市教理问答灵修书，《神的真理为我们的心灵和思想》。这本灵修书将基督教会历史上的教理问答带入生活，为一年中的每一周提供一个思考的问题。在引言中，Tim Keller阐述了教理问答的理由，这是学习和记忆构成基督教信仰基础信仰的问题和答案的丰富而共同的实践。每周包括一段经文、一个祷告和一个简短的默想，将挑战和激励你。包含的评论由当代牧师如约翰·派博、Tim Keller和凯文·德扬撰写，以及历史人物如奥古斯丁、约翰·加尔文和马丁·路德。本月，除了新城市教理问答灵修书外，我们还包括一个很棒的配套资源，儿童新城市教理问答，作为感谢你帮助福音与生活在世界各地分享基督之爱的希望。所以今天就在gospelonlife.com/give申请你的副本。那是gospelonlife.com/give。现在是Tim Keller今天教导的其余部分。

现在让我展示给你看，这只是让你沉入座位的那种东西。他说，好，我们来看看杀人。你们听见有话说不可杀人。宗教人士关心的是不要在身体上杀害某人，但我告诉你们。他说，如果在你心里有恶意，如果你鄙视他们，如果你把人当作愚蠢人，如果你蔑视他们，如果你对他们漠不关心，你就杀了他们。

然后他继续到性，说，你们听见有话说不可奸淫。你知道，基督教的性伦理是婚姻外不能有性。那是关于什么的？这就是它的意思，耶稣展示给你看，当你在婚姻外有性时，你在做的是说，我想有身体上的、外在的赤裸和脆弱，但我不想给你个人的赤裸和脆弱。换句话说，让我们在身体上赤裸，但我不想真正把自己给你在其他各方面。我不想和你结婚。我不想放弃我的独立。我不想放弃我的选择。我不想真正把我的，换句话说，我不想用实际的个人的、完全的赤裸和脆弱来支持身体上的赤裸和脆弱。我不想那样做。

耶稣基督说，当你要求身体上的赤裸却没有正直或勇气用个人的来支持，换句话说，如果你不愿意把你整个心放在那里，它说那是情欲。当你这样做，即使在幻想中，你是在刺自己的心。

然后他继续到真理。他说，你们听见有话说如果你起了誓，你最好遵守誓言。但他说，同样，那都是外在的。换句话说，你签了合同。如果你违反合同，律师会来找你。诸如此类的事情。他说，我告诉你们，是就说是，不是就说不是。他是什么意思？他的意思是你的心应该充满正直，以至于你说的每一个是和每一个不是都应该被你像你刚在一堆圣经上发誓一样认真对待，因为外在的后果应该毫无意义。换句话说，他继续下去，一直到他谈到转另一边脸。你知道，或者不要报复。他说，你可能没有在身体上报复，但我告诉你们，转另一边脸，转另一边脸是什么意思？我们以后会在今年春天讲到，但基本上转另一边脸是什么意思？转另一边脸意味着不仅是你克制不报复，而是你仍然希望有关系。你仍然希望，你在盼望那个人。你希望他有一天会亲吻你。这就是为什么你转另一边脸。你转另一边脸不是为了被打。那是另一篇讲道。

但是看，转另一边脸的整个要点是耶稣说，你不敢只是外在地克制报复。我不只是要求那个。我告诉你们，当你看一个冤枉你的人，无论他们多么混乱，无论他们多么恶毒，你需要带着希望对待他们。你需要带着饶恕对待他们。如果你要反对他们，你永远不应该反对他们除非是出于爱和善意。

当你读到这整段的结尾时，你有点像一堆冒烟的残骸。你坐在这里像这样，你开始说，听着，佛陀、孔子、穆罕默德，任何伦理教师，从来没有一个教师要求这个。从来没有。从来没有一个教师想要走得这么深。你看在某种程度上，第20节很容易。他说，你们必须超过文士、法利赛人和律法教师。他说，你们必须超过宗教人士。他真正的意思是，我要你们的心被改变，而宗教只关心外在的。

你有很多人在遵行律法，你知道，他们没有犯奸淫，没有杀人，没有报复，在讲真话。但他们做的方式和世界做的一模一样，出于恐惧和骄傲。就像，这是一个宗教人士，他们说，我讲真话。这是一个世俗的人，他们到处欺骗撒谎，做所有这些事。哦，宗教人士说，我不撒谎。我不像他们。

为什么那个世俗的人欺骗撒谎？第一，恐惧。你撒谎的原因之一是你说，哦天哪，我可能会失去我的钱，我可能会失去我的名誉。恐惧。另一个是骄傲。你说，我要搞他们。我要耍他们。恐惧和骄傲导致他们撒谎。为什么宗教人士不撒谎？为什么宗教人士讲真话？为什么？耶稣说的是，恐惧和骄傲。要么你说，我不撒谎因为神会惩罚我，最好不要撒谎。他会找上我。他会收拾我。另一种可能的方式，宗教人士说，我不撒谎，为什么？因为我不像那些撒谎的人。我不是撒谎者。我是个好人。所以出于恐惧和骄傲，你不撒谎。而那边，出于恐惧和骄傲，他们撒谎。耶稣说，有什么区别？

看，一种良善，自私的良善。宗教的良善是自私的良善。它试图获得影响力。它试图说，如果我撒谎，如果我讲真话，那神就必须对我好。如果我讲真话，那我就可以感觉比别人优越。这就是为什么宗教的良善如此疏远人，这就是为什么它如此肤浅。嗯。这就是为什么福音的良善更明亮是因为它更深刻。

好，那为什么它这么深刻？答案是这里。第三，因为它更甜美。福音的良善有一个甜美的中心。在中心发生了一些事情。关于登山宝训的好消息是这个。当你仔细阅读时，你会看到耶稣基督没有说，试着这样生活，然后神会成为你的父亲。哦，不。他一直在这里说，如果你已经知道神是你的父亲，你就能这样生活。

看第16节。他说，你为什么能让你的光照在人前？你为什么会有一种对世界不居高临下的态度？你为什么会爱不同意你的人？你为什么会是光？你为什么会明亮？因为神是你的父亲。让我更深入这个讲道。他在第六章，这是一个很吸引人的地方，耶稣说，不要忧虑，什么事都不要忧虑。你说，什么，那是什么样的命令？我怎么能停止忧虑？我怎么能停止忧虑？如果你用宗教的方式对待这个，当然，你会说，我想我得停止忧虑。我怎么做呢？我得。

耶稣说，不，不，不，不，不，不，不，不，等等，等等，他说，他说，不要忧虑这些事。你没有看到神如何照顾飞鸟吗？你没有看到神如何照顾野地的百合花吗？你不知道你的天父，如果他照顾它们，你不知道你比它们贵重多少吗？这就是耶稣向我们展示的。除非你知道你是有价值的，否则登山宝训是不可能的。耶稣总结了它。

宗教和基督教的区别是这样的。宗教是为了获得价值而遵守神的律法，试图获得价值。第六章说你给穷人施舍的原因是为了让人尊敬你。第六章说你祷告的原因是为了让神因你的话多而听你。你看，宗教人士试图获得价值，宗教人士说，如果我做所有这些好事，那神就必须听我，然后人们会尊敬我。你试图获得价值，这就是为什么你疏远人。这就是为什么在你内心深处你充满恐惧和骄傲。

但福音是出于价值而遵守神的律法，不是追求价值，而是因为你知道。那是惊人的。换句话说，除非有一个甜美的中心，除非有这种不可思议的内在甜美，一种知道你对他有不可思议的价值，他什么都会做。你知道，他什么都愿意为你做，为了抓住你并留住你。他是父亲，不是老板。如果你是雇员而你是好的，你有老板。如果你是坏的不遵守规则，你被解雇。但如果你是孩子而你有父亲或母亲，你是好的，你有父亲或母亲，你是坏的，你有一个脾气不好的父亲或母亲，但你有父亲或母亲。

事实上，哦，父亲母亲们，你们知道一些事情，不是吗？这是很奇怪的事情，如果你有三个孩子，像我一样，其中一个不听话，往往不听话的那个最牵动你的心。为什么？这是为人父母的本性。当耶稣来说，福音的良善和宗教的义之间的区别的秘密是你有神作父亲。那在你能顺服之前就发生了。那不是你为了得到而顺服的东西。那是你因为有了而顺服的东西。当你知道神是你的父亲，当你有那个甜美的中心，一切都改变了。

看，宗教人士，例如，从不做任何事除非是关于他们自己的。你为什么帮助老太太过马路？不是关于她，是关于你。也许神会回应你的祷告，你会觉得自己是个很好的人。看到了吗？你为什么帮助穷人？不是关于穷人。是关于你。这就是为什么很多时候宗教人士对穷人的帮助是如此居高临下和如此无效，因为它充满了优越感。宗教人士为什么祷告？是关于你。不是为了他。这就是为什么你的祷告充满了祈求，而很少有赞美和悔改。

因此，你看，你更明亮。它更明亮是因为它更深刻，它更深刻是因为它更甜美，它更甜美，为什么，最后，你怎么成为神的孩子？你怎么可能知道他是你的父亲？看，有人在那里说，等等，神不是所有人的父亲吗？神是所有人的父亲。耶稣说的是，在某种意义上是的，但不是我说的那种意义，因为他说知道神是你的父亲是使你成为基督徒而不是宗教人士的核心。不确定神的爱，不确定你是谁是宗教性的核心。使用良善，实际上，它是关于你的。不是关于你周围的人或神。它是利用的良善。我这样做是为了获得影响力。它是操纵的良善。我这样做是为了让人和神做我想让他们做的事。那就是区别。

因此，我怎么才能得到这种内在的甜美，答案在第17节。这是整个事情的秘密，因为福音的良善对神的律法有比任何其他良善更高的看法。你看，耶稣基督，我确定当他讲到这节时，他说，我打赌你们都在想，因为我谈论神好像他是你的父亲，你可以确定他的爱和接纳，无论你是谁，无论你是什么。我确定你们认为我对律法的看法很低。我对律法的看法比你更高。他说，基督教对律法的看法比宗教更高。

为什么？有两种宗教。我给你一种。首先，它是我所说的自由派宗教，自由派宗教基本上说，神爱每个人，你只需要尽你所能。那会给你那种内在的甜美感吗？那会让你完全确定神爱你吗？那会让你对神为了爱你所做的感到惊讶吗？不会。多愁善感。那是自由派宗教。

另一方面，你有保守派宗教，保守派宗教说，这是规则。做到。保守派宗教知道你的中心，并不真正知道你的爱，而自由派宗教知道你的爱，但神爱你没有任何代价。但耶稣基督来说，我来不是要废掉律法，这是反对自由派宗教的。我来是要成全律法。这是反对保守派宗教的。为什么？耶稣基督说我来要成全律法是什么意思？

看看这登山宝训。首先，他是唯一一个曾经活出这登山宝训的人。通读这登山宝训，你会惊讶于这品格的美丽。那是耶稣。耶稣是唯一一个曾经这样生活的人。但不仅如此，他不只是成全了登山宝训的大部分，他成全了八福。这就是他如何成全它们。

耶稣说，怜恤人的人有福了，因为他们必蒙怜恤，但耶稣基督，虽然他是怜恤的，却没有蒙怜恤，他被定罪了。清心的人有福了，因为他们必得见神。而耶稣基督，他是清心的，却没有看见神，而是他的神在十字架上转脸不看他。这就是为什么他喊道，我的神，我的神，为什么你转脸不看我？耶稣说温柔的人必承受地土，他是完美的温柔，绝对的温柔，但他被剥夺了继承权。饥渴慕义的人有福了，没有人像耶稣基督那样饥渴慕义，但他没有得满足。他被掏空了。他说，我渴了。为什么？

他，虽然温柔，失去了他的继承权，这样你，虽然不温柔，却能得到它。他，虽然清心，没有看见神，这样你我，不清心的，却能看见。他，虽然怜恤，没有得到怜恤，这样你我，不怜恤的，却能得到。耶稣基督说，我已经成全了登山宝训。我完全成全了它，因此当你信我，不仅你应得的一切都归到我身上，而且我所做的一切都归到你身上，这意味着当神看你，基督徒朋友们，弟兄姐妹们，他看到的是一个像每天都在行登山宝训的人一样美丽的人，绝对是每一天。

那是高的。那是对律法更高的看法。耶稣基督说，我比任何宗教人士更认真地对待律法，因为其他宗教人士说，尽你所能，我说，不，你必须完美，绝对完美。我已经为你完美了，这就是为什么你有那首伟大的赞美诗。约翰·牛顿写的，我会说两遍，因为你们有些人以前听过十遍，约翰·牛顿说，看到基督成全的律法，听到他赦免的声音，将奴隶变成孩子，将责任变成选择。看到基督成全的律法，听到他赦免的声音，将奴隶变成孩子，将责任变成选择。

好，实际上两三件事我们就完了。首先，这意味着什么？你有没有在纽约到处看到，你经过电话亭和公交站，你看到所有的广告，这个广告是一个穿内衣的美丽模特。它说，内在美只能到此为止。我要说一些话只是为了引起你的注意，这样你可以写下来，我听一个长老会牧师这样说。那是一个该死的谎言。被诅咒的。D-A-M-N-E-D。确实是。绝对是。它在嘲笑神国度的价值观。

你永远不会拥有颠倒的国度，在那里你不再追求权力、追求成功、追求认可，而是过一种牺牲的生活，除非你拥有从内而外的国度，它说真正重要的是我对耶稣是谁，我在我心里是谁，而不是我是否看起来对，而不是，换句话说，我需要的财富，我需要的价值，看，我需要的名誉都在他里面包裹着。这使基督徒彻底自由，我们不自我意识，我们不担心我们的银行账户。除非你有从内而外的国度，否则你永远不会活出颠倒的国度。

第二，这相当重要，第19节说，基督徒的标志之一是你喜欢研读神的律法并遵行它。如果你是宗教人士，你对神的话语有点害怕。当然，如果你是相对主义者，你蔑视神的律法。但你知道你是信徒、你有福音的良善的方式之一是诗篇一篇所说的，敬虔人的喜乐，他的喜悦是在神的律法中，他昼夜思想。换句话说，你知道你有福音的良善的方式之一是你喜欢神告诉你该做什么。你喜欢默想和发现你可以改变的地方。这是知道你是否真正理解恩典福音的最好方法之一。

因为如果你读圣经，你读登山宝训，你只是感觉很糟糕，你说，哦天哪，神怎么可能爱我，你还是不明白。你还是不理解耶稣说我来要成全律法是什么意思。你还是不明白。你还是有些宗教性。如果你不只是喜欢他告诉你该做什么，告诉你哪里错了。如果它没有给你喜悦而只是压垮你，你还是不明白。这是一个测试。

最后，如果你不确定你是不是基督徒，让我建议一些事情。登山宝训不是一根水平杆。它不是爬上神的方法。做这个做那个。不，它是一根垂直杆。它说有两条路。一条路是说出于我的良善，我将寻求让神和其他人给我我需要的内在空虚的东西。那是一种认可感，一种价值感，或者你可以说，我要把我整个生活和我接近神的方式建立在耶稣为我所做的事情上，但做你自己的救主还是让他做你的救主。看，有一条垂直线。登山宝训不是，这是一条水平线，爬上去，不，选择看到基督成全的律法，听到他赦免的声音，将奴隶变成孩子。

让我们祷告。父啊，我们感谢你向我们展示了基督教和宗教的区别。现在，我们都需要看到这一点，无论我们是基督徒，无论我们不是基督徒，还是我们不确定我们是什么，如果我们不确定我们是什么，如果我们不确定我们是什么，我们需要知道，理解这一点，这里有些人现在正在寻求找出如何与你连接。我祈求他们会明白这意味着什么。我来要成全神的律法。父啊，我们中有些人在这个房间里知道我们很多良善是宗教性的，即使我们是基督徒，这就是为什么我们没有沉浸在和欢喜耶稣为我们成全律法的原因之一。因此，我们真的不喜悦神的律法，我们的祷告生活充满死气，我们祈求你帮助我们今晚这样欢喜福音，以至于这周我们更符合你儿子的样式，因此，我们活出更明亮、更深刻、更甜美的生活。我们奉耶稣的名祷告，阿门。
