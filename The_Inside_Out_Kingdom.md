### Introduction: The Inside Out Kingdom

What does it really mean to live in a way that reflects God's kingdom? For many of us, the kingdom can feel like an abstract idea. But in today's teaching from the sermon on the Mount, Tim Keller shows how Christ offers us practical guidance for living out a compelling vision of a new kind of community shaped by grace.

> "What are you? When people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad because great is your reward in heaven."

**You are the salt of the earth.** But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled by men.

### Part 1: The Distinctiveness of Christianity

We're looking at the Sermon on the Mount because we're going to look for a number of weeks at what it means to live the Christian life. How is the Christian life concretely different when it's lived out?

Now, last week when we looked at the first very first part of the Sermon on the Mount, the Beatitudes and the woes, we saw that the Christian life is based on a very different set of values in that of the world.

> "Christianity is not just different from the world, Christianity is also distinct from religion."

**Christianity is vastly beyond its surpasses religion.** It's something utterly different than religion.

### Part 2: The Two Ways

At the end of the sermon on the mount, both in its version we have in Luke, chapter 6, and its version we have in Matthew 5 to 7, you have at the very end of the sermon on mount, Jesus always ends by saying, now in summary and conclusion, I put before you these two ways.

> "There are two paths. One leads to life, one leads to destruction."

Traditionally, people read that and say, oh, what Jesus is saying is, you can either live, according to the sermon on the mount, you can live according to the law of God, the commandments of God, you can either obey God's laws, or you can disobey God's laws.

### Part 3: Gospel Goodness vs. Religious Righteousness

Gospel goodness surpasses religious righteousness in four ways. It's brighter because it's deeper. It's deeper because it's sweeter. It's sweeter because it's higher.

#### 1. Brighter

**You are the light of the world.** Notice there's two groups of people here. There's people whose light doesn't say light and darkness. There's two groups of people doing good deeds.

#### 2. Deeper

When Jesus Christ said in verse 20, I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.

#### 3. Sweeter

Gospel goodness has a center of sweetness. There's something that's happened in the center.

#### 4. Higher

How is it possible that you could know that he's your father? See, somebody out here is saying, well, wait a minute, isn't God the father of everybody?

### Conclusion: The Inside Out Kingdom

You're never going to have the upside down kingdom, where instead of looking for power and looking for success and looking for approval, you live a life of sacrifice, unless you have the inside out kingdom.

> "To see the law by Christ fulfilled, and hear his pardoning voice, transforms a slave into a child, and duty into choice."

Let's pray. Father, we thank you that you have shown us the difference in Christianity and religion. Now, we all need to see this, whether we're Christians, whether we're not Christians or whether we're not sure what we are.

### 引言：从内而外的国度

真正反映上帝国度的生活方式意味着什么？对我们许多人来说，国度可能感觉像一个抽象的概念。但在今天的登山宝训中，Tim Keller 展示了基督如何为我们提供实际指导，以实践一种由恩典塑造的新型社区的引人注目的愿景。

> "当人们因为我侮辱你、迫害你、并虚假地说出各种恶事时，你是怎样的？要欢喜快乐，因为你在天上的赏赐是大的。"

**你们是地上的盐。** 但如果盐失去了味道，怎么能再使它变咸呢？它再无用处，只能被丢弃，被人践踏。

### 第一部分：基督教的独特性

我们正在研究登山宝训，因为我们将在数周内探讨基督徒生活的意义。基督徒的生活在具体实践中有何不同？

上周，当我们看登山宝训的第一部分，即八福和祸时，我们看到基督徒的生活基于与世界截然不同的价值观。

> "基督教不仅与世界不同，基督教也与宗教不同。"

**基督教远远超越宗教。** 它与宗教截然不同。

### 第二部分：两种道路

在登山宝训的结尾，无论是在路加福音第六章的版本，还是在马太福音五到七章的版本中，耶稣总是在结尾说，现在总结和结论，我把这两条道路放在你们面前。

> "有两条路。一条通向生命，一条通向毁灭。"

传统上，人们读到这里会说，哦，耶稣是在说，你可以选择按照登山宝训生活，按照上帝的律法生活，遵守上帝的诫命，或者你可以不遵守上帝的律法。

### 第三部分：福音的良善与宗教的义

福音的良善在四个方面超越宗教的义。它更明亮，因为它更深刻。它更深刻，因为它更甜美。它更甜美，因为它更高。

#### 1. 更明亮

**你们是世界的光。** 注意这里有两组人。有人光明，有人黑暗。两组人都在行善。

#### 2. 更深刻

当耶稣基督在第20节说，我告诉你们，除非你们的义超过法利赛人和律法教师的义，你们绝不能进入天国。

#### 3. 更甜美

福音的良善有一个甜美的中心。在中心发生了一些事情。

#### 4. 更高

你怎么可能知道他是你的父亲？看，有人会说，等等，上帝不是所有人的父亲吗？

### 结论：从内而外的国度

你永远不会拥有颠倒的国度，在那里你不再追求权力、成功和认可，而是过一种牺牲的生活，除非你拥有从内而外的国度。

> "看到基督成全的律法，听到他赦免的声音，将奴隶变成孩子，将责任变成选择。"

让我们祷告。父啊，我们感谢你向我们展示了基督教与宗教的区别。现在，我们都需要看到这一点，无论我们是基督徒，还是不是基督徒，或者不确定我们是什么。
