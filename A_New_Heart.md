### Introduction: The Ultimate Human Problem

When someone you know is contemplating life's deepest questions, who am I? What's wrong with the world? What can truly make me whole? Jesus doesn't just give us answers. He gives us Himself. In this month's podcast, Tim Keller looks at how we can share the hope we have in Christ as the answer to a person's search for meaning and purpose. As you may know, August is Go and Share month at Gospel and Life, and we've curated a wide range of free resources to help you take simple steps to share the Gospel with someone God has put in your life. You can access these resources at gospelandlife.com/share. We believe God uses small acts to do great things, and we're inviting you to do simple, small acts to go and share the Gospel this month because the Gospel changes everything.

Our scripture reading tonight is from the book of Deuteronomy, chapter 30, verses 1-10. When all these blessings and curses I have set before you, come upon you, and you take them to heart wherever the Lord your God disperses you among the nations. And when you and your children return to the Lord your God and obey Him with all your heart and with all your soul, according to everything I command you today, then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and have compassion on you, and gather you again from the nations which He's to gather you. Even if you have been banished to the most distant land under the heavens, from there the Lord your God will gather you and bring you back. He will bring you to the land that belonged to your fathers and you will take possession of it. He will make you more prosperous and numerous than your fathers. The Lord your God will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants so that you may love Him with all your heart and with all your soul and live. The Lord your God will put all these curses on your enemies who hate and persecute you. You will again obey the Lord and follow all His commands I am giving you today. Then the Lord your God will make you most prosperous in all the work of your hands and in the fruit of your womb, the young of your livestock, and the crops of your land. The Lord will again delight in you and make you prosperous just as He delighted in your fathers. If you obey the Lord your God and keep His commands and decrees that are written in this book of the law and turn to the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, this is the word of the Lord.

### The Problem: Knowing but Not Doing

We said that the book of Deuteronomy is a series of sermons that Moses preached at the very end of his life and when you're about to die there are no tangents. You get right to the point. You only say the things that are the most important that you've ever learned in your whole life and here at the very end of the end of all of the sermons at the very end of the book of Deuteronomy, Moses gets to the most crucial things you could possibly tell anyone. And tonight I would say in some ways the most crucial of everything he said so far. Here he gives us a solution to what could be called the ultimate human problem. So let's ask what's that problem, what's the solution, how do you know if you have it and if you don't, how can you receive it? What's the problem, what's the solution, how do you know if you have it, if you don't, how can you receive it? Okay, don't fall off your chairs, four points, not five points. It's only about two hour sermons, so the ordinary hour and 45 minutes.

What's the big problem? It's actually there in verses one to four. For weeks and months we have been looking at the book of Deuteronomy and basically the book of Deuteronomy is God's blueprint for how he wants human beings to live and it's an marvelous blueprint. It's a vision of a life of integrity and joyful unselfishness. And if we really live the way it says in the book to do, oh my, you know, if you were here on Labor Day, we looked at Deuteronomy 15 and there's a statement in Deuteronomy 15 that I've just been struck by for years. God says, if you obeyed everything I said in this book in the law, there would be no poor among you. He's saying, if you had a community or society of people that obeyed God's law fully and wholeheartedly, there would be no permanent class of poor people in that society at all. It would be a test. It's amazing. It's another sermon, of course, and I won't stay there, but the point is, wow, and God over and over says, if you live according to the law of God, this will be the blessedness that you will experience. This will be the blessedness that you will have.

But throughout the book of Deuteronomy, Moses has said, the warning is, if you don't obey God, if you turn from Him, if you live lives without integrity and self-fishness and pride and self-centeredness, you will be cursed. You will be cut off and you will be eventually exiled and banished. And see, verses 1 to 4, is Moses looking down the carters of time and saying, finally, here at the very end, and by the way, oh Israel, you will, you will fail. You will utterly fail in the end to obey the law of God. And you will be, see verse 1, you'll be into, you'll be dispersed. All these curses will come upon you and you, verse 4, you banished. That's bad news. However, we shouldn't pick on the Israelites. It's only in the story of Israel, we only see what is writ large in the entire human race.

There was a book put out just earlier this year by a philosopher, Jacob Needleman, wrote a book called Why Can't We Be Good? And you know, the basic point of the book is so obvious, and yet he points out that all social theorists are writing books about how we got to live. And political leaders are writing books about how we got to live, but they're all, they're just missing one point. We know how we got to live, we can't do it. The point of the book is in the book, for example, Needleman says, human beings who know what is good nevertheless remain mysteriously helpless to internally adopt and do the ethical moral and religious ideas bequeath to them. He says, this is the ultimate human problem. We know how we got to live. You keep telling us books on how we got to live, we know how we got to live. We just can't do it. We can't summons up the ability to across the board, live the way we got to live, and that's the reason why we still have the world in the mess that it's in. We know what is right to do. We can't do it. That's the ultimate problem, the human race.

Becky Pippert wrote a book called Hope Has Its Reasons, and years ago she was auditing a course in counseling psychology at Harvard University. She was listening in a class to a great case study of a young man who hated his mother but didn't know it. The case study showed how the therapist helped him see that he did hate his mother. He was incredibly bitter and that it was distorting his whole life. When the case study was over, Becky raised her hands and said, well, now how is the therapist going to help him forgive his mother? And the professor, the whole class of shock said, well, that's not therapy. He says, you're asking a lot, after all, we just gave him what he really showed him, what was going on in his insides and all that. And Becky and everybody started raising their hands and said, well, finally, the professor said, listen, if you're looking for a forgiving heart, you're in the wrong department. What he simply meant is he says, psychology is a science. We can't give you a new heart, which is what Neil Minnes trying to say. That's the biggest problem. We know what to do. We're powerless to do it.

### The Solution: A Circumcised Heart

What's the solution? Verse six. Look at this. It's an amazing. This is a gift of God. This is not something you can do. It's something that God does. Verse six. In spite of being banished, in spite of all the curses, in spite of the fact that you've blown it, verse six, the Lord, your God will circumcise your hearts. What does that mean? Well, if we're going to understand what a circumcised heart is, we have to understand what hearts are and what circumcision is. All right? First of all, what heart's are? You say, well, I know what a heart is, no, I don't think you do. You say, well, the heart is the source of the emotions and the feelings as opposed to the head, which is the source of the mind and the thoughts. And if that's wrong, according to the Bible, the Bible does not use the word heart that way. It does not use the word heart the way we use it in modern English or in our society. In the Bible, the heart is the seat of the entire acting self. And the heart controls not just the emotions, but also the thoughts and the actions. Why? Because in the Bible, the heart is the seat of your most fundamental commitments. The things that you most hope in, you most believe in, you most look to, and you most live for. The things that you look at and say, if I had that, that, then I would be happy, then I would have meaning, then I would have value. Whatever those things are that you look at like that, that determines everything.

Obviously for one of you, your greatest joy isn't what is your greatest joy and your greatest fear isn't what your greatest fear is, why? Because your emotions are flowing from these fundamental commitments, they're shaped by your fundamental commitments and all your decisions and all your thinking and all your imagination is too. The heart is the place where you decide what most turns your crank, what's most exciting, what most captures your imagination, what you most love, what you most find beautiful and attractive. Whatever those things are, that affects everything else, that shapes everything else.

All right, then what's a circumcised heart? Circumcision was the ritual that the Israelites went through when they committed to obey God in His covenant. Circumcision was obeying God when they committed to serving God in His covenant. So what would a circumcised heart be? Obviously, it's not a physical thing. It's a metaphor, but what is the metaphor for? It's this. To say you need a circumcised heart is God's way of saying and Moses' way of saying it's not enough to obey God out of duty alone. It's not enough to obey God externally only, circumcision represents external, the body, the physical. And what the circumcised heart is saying is it's not enough to only serve God because you have to, you ought to serve God because you want to, because you love to.

I had an older minister who was a mentor to me that used to say this, the being of God, the greatness of the being of God demands a love that can't be the response to a demand. The being of God, the greatness of the being of God requires a love that cannot just be a response to a requirement. What does that mean? Say, look, what do you do with your solitude? When you don't have to think of something, when you have nothing to do, when you're just sitting there twiddling your thumbs, you're waiting for a bus and a bus doesn't come. What do you automatically, instinctively love to dream about? Wish for, plan for, what are you most like reading about? What do you most instinctively, automatically love to do, not because you have to, just because you want to. That's what your heart is. And those things, those things are the things you set your heart on.

But what are those things? Everybody, come on. You know what they are. There's somebody at the opposite sex, there at your career, there's money, there's these things. But the greatest thing in the world, the greatest thing in the universe, the most beautiful thing, the most worthy thing, the most great thing in the world is what? It's God, but our hearts don't fix on that. What if, however, you had a circumcised heart? What if, however, God came in from the outside and fixed your heart so that the thing you most ought to do was the same thing you most wanted to do and love to do. That's a circumcised heart. That's an astounding thing. The thing you most want to do, the thing you most is the thing you ought to do. And that's the reason why you've got this, you know, this, just John Newton, him that goes like this that I so often like to quote, our pleasure and our duty, though opposite before, since we have seen his beauty, are joined apart no more. That's a new heart. The moment you find your pleasure and your duty that are always different, I've got to do it, I ought to do it, you know, I believe in God. I know I've got to do it. You need to be good. But here's your passion. Here's the things that you most desire to do. Here's the things that you're attracted to, our pleasure and our duty, though opposite before, since we have seen his beauty, are joined. And when that happens, you've got the circumcised heart. You've got the new heart.

Now something as big ought to be all through the Bible and it is, under different names. Ezekiel and Jeremiah say, God will give you a new heart, not just a circumcised heart. Or the spirit of God will come and write the law on your heart. That's also in there. And when Jesus talks to Nicodemus and John chapter 3, he quotes Ezekiel 37 and he says, you must be born again of the spirit. Same thing. To be born again, to be born of the spirit, to get a new heart, to have a circumcised heart is the same thing. And that is the solution to the ultimate human problem that we know how we ought to live, but we can't live it.

### Signs of a New Heart

Now thirdly, how do you know if you've got this thing? How do you know if you have a new heart or a circumcised heart? There's actually three signs embedded in verses 6, 7, 8, 6, and 8 actually that I think are extremely important signs that you have received that you have the circumcised heart. Here's the first sign. Well, the three words, by the way, they tell us the three signs are love, obey, and live. See them in there? Love, obey, and live. First, verse 6, God will circumcise your heart so you will love him with all your soul. Ah, what's that mean? Well, the first sign of a changed heart is not a change in the quantity of religious knowledge, but in the quality of spiritual awareness. This is really important, I'll say it again. It's not a change, conversion, or the new birth, or the new heart is not a change in the quantity of religious knowledge, not just learning new things, religious things. It's the quality, a whole new quality of spiritual awareness. Whenever this new heart is talked about, it's talked in terms of sensory language. So if you go back to say, do it around me 29, verse 3 and 4, it's only the chapter 4. It says, God will give you a heart to understand, eyes to see, and ears to hear, see, eyes to see, and ears to hear. What does that mean? You've known about the doctrine. You know about God. You know God's holiness. You know God's justice. You know God's love. You know these things, but when you get the new heart, you will see it. You won't just know about it. You will taste it. Sometimes that's it. It's in the Bible. Taste it. You will hear it, finally. What?

Jonathan Edwards was a pastor in 18th century New England, 1730s and 40s. And in 17th, in 18th century New England, in that time, and everybody believed Christianity. And I mean everybody. If you went to North Hampton, Massachusetts, everybody went to church. Everybody was a baptized member. Everybody believed in the Trinity and believed in the deity of Jesus and believed he died for a sins. Everybody. And yet, Jonathan Edwards learned what he knew what actually all pastors know. And yet we're always a little afraid to talk about it. And that is in spite of the fact that you have all these people out there and they're living according to Christian principles and they're believing the Christian doctrines and they're baptized and their members. Some of them have a new heart and some of them don't. Some of them have their circumcised heart and some don't. Edwards saw that. Any minister can see that. But Edwards, unlike the rest of us cowards, talked about it a lot. And he actually wrote four books on the subject, Richard Tormendus. And I've tried to work through them and there's nothing better on this subject. But I believe that in the end, here's what Edwards says, the main difference is between a person with a new heart and a person who believes and obeys and comes to church and does all the good things but doesn't have a new heart. Here's the difference. He says, people with a new heart love and obey God for the beauty and attractiveness of who he is in himself. They don't love and obey God because they have to. They don't love and obey God to get things. They don't obey love and obey God as a means to an end. They obey God because they love him as an end in and of himself. They love him aesthetically, what?

Now, yes, listen, for those of you who have heard this illustration before, be patient, but a lot of you haven't. It's my favorite and best illustration on this subject. When I was in college, I took a music appreciation course, and I had to listen to a lot of Mozart because they was on the test, and I had to be able to identify Mozart for the test. I listened to Mozart to get a passing grade in a class, so I get my degree, so I get out and get a good job. I listened to Mozart, in other words, to make money. But today, my wife and I will spend a lot of money just to listen to Mozart. What happened? Well, why do we listen to Mozart now? To get a good grade? No, I'm not in a class. People will think I'm cultured, no, nobody sees me listen to Mozart. Well, why do you listen to Mozart? You know, you can say, I don't know, but what that means is, it's beautiful. It used to be that listening to Mozart was useful. But now, it's beautiful, and beautiful means it's satisfying in and of itself. It's attractive. It fulfills in and of itself. It's not a means to an end. You don't do it because it will get you something else. It's what you want. It's one of the things that gives you meaning in life.

Now, here's what Edward said. A person with a new heart stops obeying God just because he has to, or she has to, just stops obeying God because it gets you somewhere else. But begins to aesthetically find God beautiful in and of who he is in himself, just to be near him, just to delight him, just to please him. You see, people without a new heart obey God to get things, to get forgiveness, to get blessing, to get heaven. They obey God to get things, but people with new hearts obey God just to get God, just to get him, just to be near him, just to delight him. And as a result, people with this new heart may actually have been in the church for years and know all about various doctrines. But once you get the new heart, the doctrines start to live. That is to say, they were abstractions, but now they become realities. You see the love of God, and before you just knew about it, you taste the power of God, but now before maybe you just believed in it. In other words, things that were just sort of abstractions become incredibly galvanizing and moving, and life changing, which brings me to the third point.

### Receiving a New Heart

Love, oh, the second point, pardon me, the second point. So the first sign of a changed heart, a circumcised heart, is that you love God for who he is in and of himself, and you begin to sense who he is, as opposed to just believe in a math straggly. But secondly, it changes your life. It changes you. You see the whole point of this whole passage, the whole thrust is, because you have this changed heart, now you obey, right? You don't obey to get the changed heart. The changed heart is not the result of obedience. The obedience is the result of the changed heart. The changed heart comes as a gift of grace, and from the changed heart flows a life now in conformity to the joyful unselfishness of the law of God. But you know what that means? If you really have a new heart, you get changed. See, there are people who say, oh, I like what you just said about Jesus moving me. Well, I love it when I come to Redeemer. The songs move me. The preaching moves me. Good. I love your servants. That's great. But John Edwards is not impressed, unless here's the really. John Edwards says, I'm glad you like Tim Keller's servants. I'm glad. Maybe they make you weak. That's wonderful. And you feel, oh, I really feel God's spiritual reality. Well, let's see. Do the people who know you best, the people around you who really see you, are they saying you are becoming more and more unselfish, more and more generous, more and more kind, more and more self-controlled, more and more courageous as the weeks go by? If you're not changing in the way you actually live, then you don't have that new heart. You're just being stirred. Your emotions are being stirred. That's all. To have a new heart, you have a new sense of God's spiritual reality on you. Secondly, you have a change life, but thirdly, you start growing. I love, you know, you'd almost miss it, unless you're looking for it. Carefully. Verse 6 says, the Lord your God will circumcise your hearts that you may love Him and live, live. What does that mean? Weren't they alive before? It's not talking about biological life, it's talking about spiritual life. And here's what's important. Biological life comes gradually, so does spiritual life. So I'm sure some of you are a little worried from these first two points. You know, love God, meaning he becomes the ultimate beauty of your life and you start to change and you start to say, well, I don't, hmm, hmm. You know, well, this might, this point may come for you. Think of how biological life starts out. Look at babies. Look at them. They're basket cases. They can't do a thing. They can't do a thing. Have you ever had a baby? I mean, they just take and take and they can't do anything. You've got to take them everywhere. You've got to protect them from the cells all the time. I can't tell you how many times one of my kids were 18 months old. They were screaming and crying about something and I've said, I've only had good reason with you, didn't help. But think of how slow that works, well, spiritual life, look, in spite of the fact that the moment your heart is circumcised, the moment you receive the new heart, there is a new love implanted in you. It's a seed and it takes a long time to grow into a tree. Just takes time. You know, Paul says in Romans 7, I delight in the law of God in my inn most self. Huh, that's a new, that's a circumcised heart. He says the thing I most want, the thing I most passionately love is I want to delight him. And yet he says, I see all these other desires still in my life that vie with that and they draw me away from doing what I should do in many cases. I'm improving, but you know, it's gradual, it's fits and starts, it takes time, yes. But it's also organic, what I mean by organic is this. Real spiritual, a real new heart grows organically, not mechanically. Now for example, you can grow a pile of bricks, couldn't you? You could just put the, how do you grow a pile of bricks? You just keep throwing bricks on it, it's growing, but it's growing through an external action and it's growing only in quantity. But now how does a bulb grow into a tulip? That's growth too, but it's organic growth, not mechanical growth. It's growth from the inside, not the outside, and it's growth in quality, in complexity. The organism is becoming more and more complex. It's not just growing in quantity and that real spiritual growth, the sign of a new heart is you don't just grow mechanically, you don't just learn more Bible texts and learn more doctrine and get more perfect attendance pins and rise up in the church and heap up good deeds. You don't know, organically, you become wiser person as the years go by, deeper, happier and sadder at the same time, more tender, hearted, more sensitive to other people at the same time, happier yourself, more able to admit you're wrong, tougher and tender at the same time, you grow in grace, you grow in spiritual life, you grow in spiritual character. Very different than just mechanical growth. Do you have this heart? Do you have this heart? Maybe I should, this new heart, maybe I look, some of you say, well, have you been born again? I'm asking you. Some of you may be saying, well, that's for some people. There are born again Christians, sometimes they've had hard lives, it helps them. Jesus said to Nicodemus, pillar of the community, Bible teacher, you must be born again, period. And if Nicodemus need to be born again, he was so good and so great, anybody has to be born again, and that's Jesus' point. And you say, well, I don't know, you're talking about a dramatic kind of conversion experience not necessarily. You know, when John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Church, describes his conversion experience. He was at a meeting and they were reading the Bible or reading a book about the Bible. And he says, to describe his conversion experience, my heart was strangely warmed. Now maybe that is dramatic for an Englishman, but put it another way. But you can have an experience like that and have no idea that that was the beginning of your new heart. It might be weeks later, months later, years later you look back and say, that was the beginning of the new spiritual awareness, that was the beginning, where I stopped just knowing about God and began to be a spiritual reality. That's where all the changes started, sometimes it's not dramatic. You don't know it right away, you have to look back and find it. But you must be born again, you must get your heart circumcised, you must get a new heart. Do you have it? Do you see these things in yourself? Well if you don't, how do you get it? And here's my suggestion to you. Don't say, God, give me a new heart. You know, I need a new heart, why? Because I want to be a better person. It won't come that way. Here's what I want you to do. I want you to see how God procured a new heart. How did God get a new heart for us? Look, we've been banished. We've been exiled. Go to Adam and Eve. You say, well, that's the Jews, okay, Adam and Eve, that's all of us. Adam and Eve were put in the garden of Eden, paradise, and because they wanted to be their own master, their own savers and Lord, they were banished, they were exiled. So we're all on the same boat. How could God possibly, in spite of all the curses that we deserve, just give us a new heart? How can he do it? The answer is in the right of circumcision. Let's go back and for a minute, think about circumcision. A lot of you are saying, I don't want to think about circumcision, okay. Why is that the way the Israelites made their contract with God, you know, made their commitment with God? Why? I mean, how about a tattoo? How about a, you know, cutting a lock of hair? Why circumcision? You know, gross and bloody and vuh, that's the point. Yes, now you're getting the point. Because when Abraham made his covenant with God in Genesis 15, he walked between the torn pieces of a dead animal. Why? As he was making his promise, he walked through the pieces of the dead animal. Why? He was acting out the penalty for disobedience. He was acting out the curse of the covenant by walking through the pieces. He was saying, I promise you my allegiance and Lord, if I don't do what I'm promising today, may I be torn to pieces. That's what circumcision is. When the Israelites were circumcised, what they were saying is, we will obey you. And if we are not obedient to you, may we be cut off? Because circumcision was an enactment, a dramatization of the curse of sin, the curse of the covenant. What is the penalty for sin? When you lie, it cuts you off from other people. When you cheat, when you're cruel, it isolates you. You can even see it there. The punishment of sin, the curse for sin is banishment. It's exile. It's being cut off. Cut off from people. Cut off from your country. Cut off from God. Circumcision represents the thing that we ought to experience. Circumcision. How did God give us a new heart on the cross? Centuries later, on an afternoon that turned into a dark and stormy night, Jesus was cut. A spear thorns in his brow, spear in his side, nails in his hands, he was being cut. And when he said, my God, my God, why has thou forsaken me? What was happening? He wasn't just being physically cut. It says right here in Isaiah 53, what happened to him? He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities, the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed for he was cut off from the land of the living. And now and only now, because you just sat through 30 minutes of this sermon, you will have any idea what that strange passage in Colossians 2, 11 and 12 means. Because when Colossians 2, 11 and 12 says, Christians, you have been circumcised in the circumcision of Christ on the cross. And you were baptized in the baptism of Christ on the cross. And you read that and you say, what? But now maybe you understand. On the cross, Jesus Christ was experiencing the cosmic cutting off that circumcision represented. He was experiencing the circumcision of judgment. He was being cut off from us. He was getting what we deserve for not doing the good we know we ought to do. He was taking the penalty at the gate of the Garden of Eden, barring Adam and Eve going back was a flaming sword, the sword of God's judgment. But the sword came down on Jesus. He was cut off so now we can go in. As you see, now did you hear all that? As you think about Jesus doing that for you. As you think about Him doing it for you. As you think about how Jesus Christ procured a new heart for you. Does it move you? Is the way He procured the new heart moves you? That's the beginning of the new heart in you. Did you understand that? See if you just ask God, oh God, give me a new heart. Why? No, for blessing. Because I just need something in my life, never work. But if you look at what Jesus Christ did, if what Jesus Christ did, His cutting off, His experiences, what He did for you. If that moves you, if what He did to procure your new heart moves you, that's the beginning of the new heart in you. Why? That's the beauty that makes pleasure and duty one. Because the Him goes, our pleasure and our duty, though opposite before, since we have seen His beauty are joined to part no more, but what is the beauty? The next verse goes, to see the law by Christful filled and hear His pardoning voice, transforms a slave into a child and duty into choice. The beauty of what Jesus Christ did on the cross, taking your cosmic cutting off for you. If that moves you, then that's the beginning of the new heart in you. You wouldn't be moved except God's already working. Isn't that amazing? He's already working. You know, birth isn't something you can just decide to do. Nobody ever says, I think I get born. Birth is something that happens to you, but you're active in it. And that's what I'm suggesting to you. Do you have this new heart if you don't, then look at what Jesus Christ did. And if it begins to move you so that you say, now give me this new heart, not because of anything I have done, but because of what Jesus Christ has done, He took it all for me. That's the beginning of the new heart. You wouldn't even be asking, except God's already working in you. That's how you get the new birth. That's how it works. And guess what? If you've already got the new life in you, maybe you've had it for many years. That's also how the new life is stirred up to greater organic growth. Look at what He did and receive it. Let's pray.

Thank you, Father, for giving us what we need in order to have new hearts, and then to have that new life in us stirred up. So we pray that you would show us the beauty of what Jesus did and weld together, our pleasure and our duty. So that you, O Lord, Jesus Christ, become the center of our lives. We pray this in Jesus' name, amen.

### 引言：终极的人类问题

当你认识的人在思考人生最深刻的问题时，我是谁？世界出了什么问题？什么能真正使我完整？耶稣不仅给我们答案，他给了我们自己。在本月的播客中，Tim Keller 探讨了我们如何分享我们在基督里的希望，作为一个人寻找意义和目的的答案。正如你可能知道的，八月是《福音与生活》的“去分享”月，我们策划了一系列免费的资源，帮助你采取简单的步骤，与上帝放在你生命中的人分享福音。你可以在 gospelandlife.com/share 访问这些资源。我们相信上帝使用小行动来做大事，我们邀请你在这个月做简单的小行动去分享福音，因为福音改变一切。

今晚的经文阅读来自《申命记》第30章，第1-10节。当我在你面前设立的所有这些祝福和诅咒临到你身上时，无论耶和华你的神把你分散到哪个国家，你都要把它们放在心上。当你和你的孩子们回到耶和华你的神那里，并全心全意地遵从我今天吩咐你的一切时，耶和华你的神将恢复你的财富，对你有怜悯，并从他要聚集你的国家中再次聚集你。即使你被流放到天涯海角，耶和华你的神也会从那里聚集你，把你带回来。他会带你到属于你祖先的土地，你将占有它。他会使你比你的祖先更加繁荣和众多。耶和华你的神将割除你和你后代的心，使你可以全心全意地爱他并活着。耶和华你的神会把这些诅咒放在恨你和迫害你的敌人身上。你将再次遵从耶和华，遵循我今天给你的所有命令。然后，耶和华你的神将在你手中的一切工作中使你最繁荣，在你子宫的果实中，在你的牲畜的幼崽中，在你土地的作物中。耶和华将再次喜悦你，使你繁荣，就像他喜悦你的祖先一样。如果你遵从耶和华你的神，遵守这本律法书中写的命令和法令，并全心全意地转向耶和华你的神，这是耶和华的话。

### 问题：知道却做不到

我们说《申命记》是摩西在他生命的最后阶段所传讲的一系列讲道，当你即将去世时，没有偏题。你直奔主题。你只会说出你一生中学到的最重要的事情，而在《申命记》的最后，在所有讲道的最后，摩西讲到了你可能告诉任何人的最关键的事情。今晚我会说，在某些方面，这是他迄今为止所说的一切中最关键的。在这里，他给我们提供了一个可以称为终极人类问题的解决方案。那么，让我们问，那个问题是什么，解决方案是什么，你怎么知道你是否拥有它，如果没有，你如何获得它？问题是什么，解决方案是什么，你怎么知道你是否拥有它，如果没有，你如何获得它？好吧，不要从椅子上掉下来，四点，不是五点。大约是两个小时的讲道，所以通常是一个小时四十五分钟。

大问题是什么？实际上就在第1到4节中。几周和几个月来，我们一直在研究《申命记》，基本上《申命记》是上帝为人类生活的蓝图，这是一个奇妙的蓝图。这是一个完整和快乐无私生活的愿景。如果我们真的按照书中所说的去生活，哦，我的天，如果你在劳动节那天在这里，我们看了《申命记》第15章，其中有一句话我多年来一直被打动。上帝说，如果你遵守我在这本律法书中所说的一切，就不会有穷人在你中间。他在说，如果你有一个完全和全心全意遵守上帝律法的社区或社会，那么在那个社会中就不会有永久的贫困阶级。这将是一个测试。这是惊人的。当然，这是另一个讲道，我不会停留在那里，但重点是，哇，上帝一再说，如果你按照上帝的律法生活，这将是你将体验到的祝福。这将是你将拥有的祝福。

但在《申命记》全书中，摩西一直在说，警告是，如果你不遵从上帝，如果你背离他，如果你过着没有诚信、自私、骄傲和自我中心的生活，你将被诅咒。你将被切断，最终将被流放和放逐。看看第1到4节，摩西在时间的长廊中向下看，并说，最后，在最后，顺便说一句，以色列啊，你会，你会失败。最终你将彻底失败，无法遵守上帝的律法。你将会，看到第1节，你将被分散。所有这些诅咒将降临到你身上，你，第4节，你被放逐。这是坏消息。然而，我们不应该挑剔以色列人。在以色列的故事中，我们只看到了整个人人类的缩影。

今年早些时候，一位哲学家雅各布·尼德尔曼出版了一本书，名为《为什么我们不能做好？》。你知道，这本书的基本观点是如此明显，但他指出，所有社会理论家都在写关于我们如何生活的书。政治领袖也在写关于我们如何生活的书，但他们都只是错过了一个点。我们知道我们该如何生活，但我们做不到。这本书的观点是，例如，尼德尔曼说，人类知道什么是好的，但仍然神秘地无力在内部采用和实践传给他们的伦理、道德和宗教观念。他说，这是终极的人类问题。我们知道我们该如何生活。你继续告诉我们关于我们该如何生活的书，我们知道我们该如何生活。我们只是做不到。我们无法召唤出能力来全面地生活我们该如何生活，这就是为什么我们仍然有这个世界处于混乱状态的原因。我们知道该做什么是对的。我们做不到。这是人类的终极问题。

Becky Pippert 写了一本书，名为《希望有其理由》，多年前她在哈佛大学旁听了一门咨询心理学课程。她在课堂上听了一个关于一个年轻人的伟大案例研究，这个年轻人恨他的母亲但不知道。案例研究展示了治疗师如何帮助他看到他确实恨他的母亲。他非常痛苦，这扭曲了他的一生。案例研究结束后，Becky 举手说，好吧，现在治疗师将如何帮助他原谅他的母亲？教授和整个班级震惊地说，这不是治疗。他说，你要求很多，毕竟，我们只是给了他真正展示了他内心发生了什么的一切。Becky 和大家开始举手说，最后，教授说，听着，如果你在寻找一个宽恕的心，你在错误的部门。他的意思是说，心理学是一门科学。我们不能给你一个新心，这就是尼德尔曼想说的。这是最大的问题。我们知道该做什么。我们无能为力去做。

### 解决方案：受割礼的心

解决方案是什么？第六节。看看这个。这是一个惊人的。这是上帝的礼物。这不是你能做的事情。这是上帝做的事情。第六节。尽管被放逐，尽管所有的诅咒，尽管你已经搞砸了，第六节，耶和华你的神将割除你的心。这是什么意思？好吧，如果我们要理解什么是受割礼的心，我们必须理解什么是心和什么是割礼。好吧？首先，心是什么？你说，好吧，我知道心是什么，不，我不认为你知道。你说，心是情感和感觉的来源，而不是头脑，头脑是思想和思维的来源。如果这是错误的，根据圣经，圣经并不这样使用心这个词。它不使用心这个词像我们在现代英语或我们的社会中使用的那样。在圣经中，心是整个行动自我的座位。心不仅控制情感，还控制思想和行动。为什么？因为在圣经中，心是你最基本承诺的座位。你最希望的事情，你最相信的事情，你最依赖的事情，你最生活的事情。你看着这些事情说，如果我有那个，那个，那么我会幸福，那么我会有意义，那么我会有价值。无论那些事情是什么，你看着那些事情，那决定了一切。

显然，对于你们中的一个人来说，你最大的快乐不是你最大的快乐，你最大的恐惧不是你最大的恐惧，为什么？因为你的情感是从这些基本承诺中流出的，它们被你的基本承诺所塑造，你所有的决定和所有的思维和所有的想象也是如此。心是你决定什么最能激发你的地方，什么最令人兴奋，什么最能捕捉你的想象力，什么是你最爱的，什么是你最觉得美丽和吸引人的。无论那些事情是什么，那影响着其他一切，那塑造着其他一切。

好吧，那么什么是受割礼的心？割礼是以色列人在他们承诺遵守上帝的约时所经历的仪式。割礼是当他们承诺在上帝的约中服侍上帝时遵守上帝的。那么受割礼的心是什么？显然，这不是一个物理的东西。这是一个比喻，但这个比喻是什么？是这样的。说你需要一个受割礼的心是上帝的方式和摩西的方式说，仅仅出于责任感来遵从上帝是不够的。仅仅外在地遵从上帝是不够的，割礼代表外在，身体，物理。受割礼的心所说的是，仅仅因为你必须服侍上帝是不够的，你应该因为你想要，因为你爱而服侍上帝。

我有一个年长的牧师，他是我的导师，他常常这样说，上帝的存在，上帝存在的伟大要求一种不能仅仅是对要求的回应的爱。上帝的存在，上帝存在的伟大要求一种不能仅仅是对要求的回应的爱。这是什么意思？说，看，你在孤独中做什么？当你不必思考某件事时，当你无事可做时，当你只是坐在那里转动拇指时，你在等公共汽车而公共汽车没有来。你自动地，本能地喜欢梦想什么？希望什么，计划什么，你最喜欢读什么？你最本能地，自动地喜欢做什么，不是因为你必须，只是因为你想要。这就是你的心。而那些事情，那些事情是你设定心的事情。

但那些事情是什么？大家，来吧。你知道它们是什么。有某个人在异性那里，在你的职业生涯中，有钱，有这些事情。但世界上最伟大的事情，宇宙中最伟大的事情，最美丽的事情，最有价值的事情，世界上最伟大的事情是什么？是上帝，但我们的心不固定在那上面。然而，如果你有一个受割礼的心呢？然而，如果上帝从外面进来并修复你的心，使你最应该做的事情是你最想做和爱做的事情。这就是受割礼的心。这是一个惊人的事情。你最想做的事情，你最的是你应该做的事情。这就是为什么你有这个，你知道，这个，只是约翰·牛顿，他的诗歌是这样的，我经常喜欢引用，我们的快乐和我们的责任，尽管以前是对立的，自从我们看到了他的美丽，再也不分开。这是一个新心。当你发现你的快乐和你的责任总是不同的，我必须做，我应该做，你知道，我相信上帝。我知道我必须做。你需要做好。但这是你的激情。这是你最想做的事情。这是你被吸引的事情，我们的快乐和我们的责任，尽管以前是对立的，自从我们看到了他的美丽，再也不分开。当那发生时，你有了受割礼的心。你有了新心。

现在，像这样大的事情应该贯穿整个圣经，并且在不同的名字下。以西结和耶利米说，上帝会给你一个新心，而不仅仅是一个受割礼的心。或者上帝的灵会来并在你的心上写下律法。这也在里面。当耶稣在约翰福音第三章与尼哥底母谈话时，他引用了以西结书37章，并说，你必须从圣灵重生。同样的事情。重生，从圣灵重生，得到一个新心，拥有一个受割礼的心是同一件事。这就是终极人类问题的解决方案，我们知道我们应该如何生活，但我们无法生活。

### 新心的标志

现在第三，怎么知道你是否有这个东西？你怎么知道你是否有一个新心或一个受割礼的心？实际上在第6、7、8、6和8节中嵌入了三个标志，我认为这些标志非常重要，表明你已经接受了你有受割礼的心。第一个标志是什么？顺便说一下，这三个词，它们告诉我们三个标志是爱、服从和生活。看到它们了吗？爱、服从和生活。首先，第6节，上帝将割除你的心，使你全心全意地爱他。啊，这是什么意思？好吧，改变心的第一个标志不是宗教知识数量的变化，而是精神意识质量的变化。这真的很重要，我会再说一遍。这不是一个变化，转换，或新生，或新心不是宗教知识数量的变化，不仅仅是学习新事物，宗教事物。这是质量，完全新质量的精神意识。每当谈到这个新心时，它都是以感官语言谈论的。所以如果你回到说，围绕我29章，第3和4节，它只是第4章。它说，上帝会给你一颗理解的心，眼睛去看，耳朵去听，看，眼睛去看，耳朵去听。这是什么意思？你知道关于教义的。你知道关于上帝的。你知道上帝的圣洁。你知道上帝的公义。你知道上帝的爱。你知道这些事情，但当你得到新心时，你会看到它。你不仅仅是知道它。你会品尝它。有时就是这样。在圣经中。品尝它。你最终会听到它。什么？

乔纳森·爱德华兹是18世纪新英格兰的一位牧师，1730年代和40年代。在17世纪，在18世纪的新英格兰，在那个时候，每个人都相信基督教。我的意思是每个人。如果你去北安普顿，马萨诸塞州，每个人都去教堂。每个人都是受洗的成员。每个人都相信三位一体，相信耶稣的神性，相信他为罪而死。每个人。然而，乔纳森·爱德华兹学到了他知道的实际上所有牧师都知道的东西。然而，我们总是有点害怕谈论它。那就是尽管你有所有这些人在外面，他们按照基督教原则生活，他们相信基督教教义，他们受洗，他们是成员。他们中的一些人有新心，有些人没有。有些人有他们的受割礼的心，有些人没有。爱德华兹看到了这一点。任何牧师都能看到这一点。但爱德华兹，不像我们其他的懦夫，谈论了很多。他实际上写了四本关于这个主题的书，理查德·托尔门德斯。我试图通过它们，没有什么比这更好的了。但我相信，最后，这就是爱德华兹所说的，主要的区别在于一个有新心的人和一个相信并服从并来教堂并做所有好事但没有新心的人之间。这里的区别。他说，有新心的人因为上帝本身的美丽和吸引力而爱和服从上帝。他们不是因为必须而爱和服从上帝。他们不是为了得到东西而爱和服从上帝。他们不是为了达到目的而爱和服从上帝。他们因为爱他作为目的本身而服从上帝。他们美学地爱他，什么？

现在，是的，听着，对于那些听过这个例子的人，请耐心，但很多人没有。这是我在这个主题上最喜欢和最好的例子。当我在大学时，我上了一门音乐欣赏课程，我必须听很多莫扎特，因为它在考试中，我必须能够识别莫扎特以通过考试。我听莫扎特是为了在班上获得及格成绩，以便获得学位，以便出去找一份好工作。换句话说，我听莫扎特是为了赚钱。但今天，我和我的妻子会花很多钱只是为了听莫扎特。发生了什么？好吧，我们现在为什么听莫扎特？为了获得好成绩？不，我不在班上。人们会认为我有文化，不，没人看到我听莫扎特。好吧，你为什么听莫扎特？你知道，你可以说，我不知道，但这意味着，它是美丽的。过去听莫扎特是有用的。但现在，它是美丽的，美丽意味着它本身就是令人满意的。它是吸引人的。它本身就是满足的。它不是达到目的的手段。你不这样做是因为它会给你带来其他东西。这是你想要的。这是给你生活意义的事情之一。

现在，这就是爱德华兹所说的。有新心的人不再仅仅因为他必须或她必须而服从上帝，不再仅仅因为它会带你到其他地方而服从上帝。但开始美学地发现上帝在他本身中是美丽的，只是为了接近他，只是为了取悦他，只是为了取悦他。你看，没有新心的人服从上帝是为了得到东西，为了得到宽恕，为了得到祝福，为了得到天堂。他们服从上帝是为了得到东西，但有新心的人服从上帝只是为了得到上帝，只是为了接近他，只是为了取悦他。结果，有新心的人可能实际上已经在教堂里多年，并了解各种教义。但一旦你得到新心，教义就开始活起来。也就是说，它们是抽象的，但现在它们变成了现实。你看到上帝的爱，以前你只是知道它，你品尝上帝的力量，但现在以前你可能只是相信它。换句话说，事情只是抽象的变得令人难以置信的激励和感动，并且改变生活，这让我想到了第三点。

### 接受新心

爱，哦，第二点，原谅我，第二点。所以改变心的第一个标志，一个受割礼的心，是你因为上帝本身的美丽而爱上帝，你开始感受到他是谁，而不仅仅是相信一个数学公式。但其次，它改变了你的生活。它改变了你。你看，这整段经文的重点是，因为你有了这个改变的心，现在你服从，对吗？你不是为了得到改变的心而服从。改变的心不是服从的结果。服从是改变心的结果。改变的心是恩典的礼物，从改变的心流出一种生活，现在符合上帝律法的快乐无私。但你知道这意味着什么吗？如果你真的有一个新心，你会改变。看，有人说，哦，我喜欢你刚才说的关于耶稣感动我的话。好吧，我喜欢当我来到救赎者时。歌曲感动我。讲道感动我。很好。我爱你的仆人。那很好。但约翰·爱德华兹并不印象深刻，除非这里是现实。约翰·爱德华兹说，我很高兴你喜欢 Tim Keller 的仆人。我很高兴。也许他们让你虚弱。那很棒。你感到，哦，我真的感受到了上帝的精神现实。好吧，让我们看看。那些最了解你的人，真正看到你的人，他们是否说你变得越来越无私，越来越慷慨，越来越善良，越来越自控，越来越勇敢，随着时间的推移？如果你没有在你实际生活的方式上改变，那么你没有那个新心。你只是被激动。你的情感被激动。仅此而已。要有一个新心，你对上帝的精神现实有了新的感觉。其次，你有一个改变的生活，但第三，你开始成长。我喜欢，你知道，除非你在寻找它，否则你几乎会错过它。仔细。第6节说，耶和华你的神将割除你的心，使你可以爱他并活着，活着。这是什么意思？他们以前不是活着吗？这不是在谈论生物生命，而是在谈论精神生命。这里重要的是。生物生命逐渐到来，精神生命也是如此。所以我确信你们中的一些人对这前两点有点担心。你知道，爱上帝，意味着他成为你生命的终极美丽，你开始改变，你开始说，好吧，我不知道，嗯，嗯。你知道，好吧，这可能，这一点可能对你有用。想想生物生命是如何开始的。看看婴儿。看看他们。他们是篮子里的案例。他们什么都做不了。他们什么都做不了。你有没有过一个婴儿？我的意思是，他们只是拿走和拿走，他们什么都做不了。你必须带他们到处走。你必须一直保护他们免受细胞的伤害。我不能告诉你多少次我的一个孩子18个月大。他们在尖叫和哭泣关于某件事，我说，我只有好的理由和你说话，没有帮助。但想想这有多慢，嗯，精神生活，看，尽管在你心被割除的那一刻，你接受了新心的那一刻，有一种新的爱植入了你。它是一个种子，需要很长时间才能长成一棵树。只是需要时间。你知道，保罗在罗马书第7章中说，我在我内心最深处喜悦上帝的律法。嗯，那是一个新心，那是一个受割礼的心。他说我最想要的东西，我最热爱的东西是我想要取悦他。然而他说，我看到我生活中仍然有所有这些其他欲望，它们与之竞争，并在许多情况下将我从应该做的事情中拉走。我在进步，但你知道，这是渐进的，这是适应和开始的，需要时间，是的。但它也是有机的，我所说的有机是这样的。真正的精神，一个真正的新心有机地成长，而不是机械地成长。现在例如，你可以长出一堆砖块，不是吗？你可以只是把，如何长出一堆砖块？你只需继续扔砖块，它在增长，但它通过外部动作增长，并且只在数量上增长。但现在一个球茎如何长成郁金香？那也是增长，但它是有机增长，而不是机械增长。它是从内部增长，而不是从外部增长，并且在质量上增长，在复杂性上增长。生物体变得越来越复杂。它不仅仅在数量上增长，而是真正的精神增长，新心的标志是你不仅仅是机械地成长，你不仅仅是学习更多的圣经文本和学习更多的教义并获得更多的完美出勤奖章并在教会中上升并积累善行。你不知道，有机地，随着岁月的流逝，你变得更加聪明，更加深刻，同时更加快乐和悲伤，更加温柔，更加敏感于他人，同时更加快乐自己，更加能够承认你错了，同时更加坚韧和温柔，你在恩典中成长，你在精神生活中成长，你在精神品格中成长。与仅仅是机械增长非常不同。你有这个心吗？你有这个心吗？也许我应该，这个新心，也许我看，一些人说，好吧，你重生了吗？我在问你。你们中的一些人可能会说，好吧，那是为某些人准备的。有些人是重生的基督徒，有时他们有艰难的生活，这对他们有帮助。耶稣对尼哥底母说，社区的支柱，圣经教师，你必须重生，句号。如果尼哥底母需要重生，他是如此的好和伟大，任何人都必须重生，这就是耶稣的观点。你说，好吧，我不知道，你在谈论一种戏剧性的转换体验，不一定。你知道，当约翰·卫斯理，卫理公会教会的创始人，描述他的转换体验时。他在一个会议上，他们在读圣经或读一本关于圣经的书。他说，为了描述他的转换体验，我的心被奇怪地温暖了。现在也许这对一个英国人来说是戏剧性的，但换句话说。但你可以有这样的体验，却不知道那是你新心的开始。可能是几周后，几个月后，几年后你回头看，说，那是新精神意识的开始，那是开始，我不再只是知道上帝，而是开始成为一种精神现实。那是所有变化开始的地方，有时它并不戏剧化。你不会立即知道，你必须回头找到它。但你必须重生，你必须让你的心受割礼，你必须得到一个新心。你有吗？你在自己身上看到这些东西吗？如果没有，你如何获得它？这是我的建议给你。不要说，上帝，给我一个新心。你知道，我需要一个新心，为什么？因为我想成为一个更好的人。它不会那样来。这里是我想让你做的。我想让你看看上帝是如何获得一个新心的。上帝是如何为我们获得一个新心的？看，我们被放逐了。我们被流放了。去亚当和夏娃。你说，好吧，那是犹太人，好吧，亚当和夏娃，那是我们所有人。亚当和夏娃被放在伊甸园，天堂，因为他们想成为自己的主人，自己的救世主和主，他们被放逐，他们被流放。所以我们都在同一条船上。上帝怎么可能，尽管我们应得的所有诅咒，只是给我们一个新心？他怎么能做到呢？答案在割礼的仪式中。让我们回去想一想割礼。很多人说，我不想想割礼，好吧。为什么这是以色列人与上帝签订合同的方式，你知道，与上帝的承诺？为什么？我的意思是，纹身怎么样？剪一缕头发怎么样？为什么是割礼？你知道，恶心和血腥和呃，那就是重点。是的，现在你明白了。因为当亚伯拉罕在创世纪15章与上帝立约时，他走在一只死去的动物的撕裂部分之间。为什么？当他做出承诺时，他走过死去动物的部分。为什么？他在演绎不服从的惩罚。他在演绎通过走过部分的约的诅咒。他在说，我承诺我的忠诚和主，如果我不做我今天承诺的事情，愿我被撕成碎片。这就是割礼。当以色列人受割礼时，他们在说，我们会服从你。如果我们不服从你，愿我们被切断？因为割礼是罪的诅咒，约的诅咒的演绎，戏剧化。罪的惩罚是什么？当你撒谎时，它切断你与他人的联系。当你作弊，当你残忍时，它使你孤立。你甚至可以在那里看到它。罪的惩罚，罪的诅咒是放逐。是流放。是被切断。切断与人。切断与你的国家。切断与上帝。割礼代表我们应该经历的事情。割礼。上帝如何在十字架上给我们一个新心？几个世纪后，在一个变成黑暗和暴风雨的夜晚的下午，耶稣被割了。一个矛刺在他的额头，矛刺在他的侧面，钉子在他的手中，他被割了。当他说，我的上帝，我的上帝，为什么你离弃了我？发生了什么？他不仅仅是被身体割了。它就在以赛亚书53章中说，发生了什么？他因我们的过犯被刺伤，因我们的罪孽被压伤，带给我们平安的惩罚在他身上，因他的伤我们得医治，因为他被从活人之地割断。现在，只有现在，因为你刚刚坐了30分钟的讲道，你才会对歌罗西书2章11和12节中那段奇怪的经文有任何了解。因为当歌罗西书2章11和12节说，基督徒，你们在十字架上已经在基督的割礼中受割礼。你们在十字架上已经在基督的洗礼中受洗。你读到那段经文，你说，什么？但现在也许你明白了。在十字架上，耶稣基督正在经历割礼所代表的宇宙切断。他正在经历审判的割礼。他被我们切断。他正在承受我们因为没有做我们知道该做的好事而应得的惩罚。在伊甸园门口，阻止亚当和夏娃回去的是一把燃烧的剑，上帝审判的剑。但剑落在了耶稣身上。他被切断，所以现在我们可以进去。你看，现在你听到了吗？当你想到耶稣为你做的事情时。当你想到他为你做的事情时。当你想到耶稣基督为你获得一个新心时。它感动你吗？他获得新心的方式感动你吗？那是你内心新心的开始。你明白了吗？看看你只是问上帝，哦，上帝，给我一个新心。为什么？不，为了祝福。因为我只是需要生活中的某些东西，从未工作。但如果你看看耶稣基督所做的，如果耶稣基督所做的，他的切断，他的经历，他为你所做的。如果那感动你，如果他为你获得新心所做的事情感动你，那就是你内心新心的开始。为什么？那是使快乐和责任合一的美丽。因为诗歌说，我们的快乐和我们的责任，尽管以前是对立的，自从我们看到了他的美丽，再也不分开，但美丽是什么？下一节说，看到基督所成就的律法，听到他的赦免声音，将奴隶变成孩子，将责任变成选择。耶稣基督在十字架上所做的美丽，承受你的宇宙切断。如果那感动你，那么那就是你内心新心的开始。你不会被感动，除非上帝已经在工作。那不是很惊人吗？他已经在工作。你知道，出生不是你可以决定做的事情。没有人说，我想我出生。出生是发生在你身上的事情，但你在其中是积极的。这就是我建议给你的。你有这个新心吗，如果没有，那么看看耶稣基督所做的。如果它开始感动你，以至于你说，现在给我这个新心，不是因为我做了什么，而是因为耶稣基督所做的，他为我承受了一切。那是新心的开始。你甚至不会问，除非上帝已经在你里面工作。这就是你获得新生的方式。这就是它的工作方式。猜猜看？如果你已经有了新的生命在你里面，也许你已经有了很多年。这也是如何激发新的生命以更大的有机增长。看看他所做的并接受它。让我们祷告。

感谢父亲，给了我们所需的东西，以便拥有新心，然后在我们里面激发那种新生命。所以我们祈祷你会向我们展示耶稣所做的美丽，并将我们的快乐和责任焊接在一起。使你，哦主，耶稣基督，成为我们生活的中心。我们奉耶稣的名祈祷，阿门。
