### Introduction: Jesus as King

Christianity isn't just a spiritual practice or set of moral teachings. At its heart, it's the person of Jesus actively pursuing us. In today's teaching, Tim Keller impacts how Jesus actively seeks us, reveals truth to us, and calls us to Himself. We've been looking all month at aspects of who Jesus is, and today we're going to look at what it means to say Jesus as a king.

> "In today's teaching, Tim Keller impacts how Jesus actively seeks us, reveals truth to us, and calls us to Himself."

**Christianity is centered on Jesus actively pursuing us.**

### The Kingship of Christ: Two Aspects

#### 1. The Coming Kingdom

For now, Ephesians 1, and we read, and He made known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Christ to be put into effect when the times will have reached their fulfillment, to bring all things in heaven and on earth together under one head, even Christ.

- Jesus Christ has a kingdom coming.
- His kingdom has a future aspect.

**The universe began to disintegrate when humanity decided to be its own king.**

#### 2. Christ as King of History

He is king right now of history. He may not have put down all resistance to himself yet in the world. He may not have put down all resistance to himself yet in humanity. But history has no resistance to him.

- Jesus is in complete charge of every event of history.
- Everything is part of His plan.

**Jesus Christ is in the driver's seat of history.**

### God's Providence: Everything is Part of His Plan

#### 1. Little Things

Everything means God's plan includes little things. God's plan includes little things, it has to.

- Even when you flip a coin, if it comes down heads or it comes down tails, it was part of his plan.

#### 2. Our Choices

God's plan includes our choices. Fatalism does not include our choices in a fatalistic system of thought.

- Christianity says everything is part of God's plan, including your choices.

#### 3. Bad Things

God hates the bad things, and yet, he includes the bad things. He weaves them into his plan.

- All things work together for good to those who love God.

**God's plan includes everything, therefore, little things, choices, and bad things.**

### Practical Implications of God's Kingship

If you understand that God's plan includes bad things, that God's plan includes your choices, that God's plan includes little things, and that all of God's plan is controlling every single event to the end and to the goal of making Jesus Christ all in all and king of all healing the universe, then you understand the doctrine of providence.

- It will make you feisty.
- It will bring contentment.
- It will humble you.

**Either every molecule in the universe is for you or every molecule in the universe is against you.**

### 引言：耶稣为王

基督教不仅仅是一种灵修实践或一套道德教义。其核心是耶稣这个人积极地追求我们。在今天的教导中，Tim Keller 讲述了耶稣如何积极地寻找我们，向我们揭示真理，并呼召我们归向祂。我们整个月份都在探讨耶稣是谁的各个方面，今天我们要看看称耶稣为王意味着什么。

> "在今天的教导中，Tim Keller 讲述了耶稣如何积极地寻找我们，向我们揭示真理，并呼召我们归向祂。"

**基督教的核心是耶稣积极地追求我们。**

### 基督的王权：两个方面

#### 1. 未来的国度

现在，我们来看以弗所书 1 章，我们读到，祂照着自己的美意，使我们知道祂旨意的奥秘，这美意是祂在基督里所定的计划，要在日期满足的时候，使天上地上一切所有的，都在基督里同归于一。

- 耶稣基督有一个即将到来的国度。
- 祂的国度有一个未来的方面。

**当人类决定自己做王时，宇宙开始解体。**

#### 2. 历史的君王

祂现在是历史的君王。祂可能还没有在世界上消除对祂的所有抵抗。祂可能还没有在人类中消除对祂的所有抵抗。但历史对祂没有抵抗。

- 耶稣完全掌控历史的每一个事件。
- 一切都是祂计划的一部分。

**耶稣基督掌控着历史的方向。**

### 神的护理：一切都是祂计划的一部分

#### 1. 小事

一切意味着神的计划包括小事。神的计划必须包括小事。

- 即使你抛硬币，如果是正面还是反面，都是祂计划的一部分。

#### 2. 我们的选择

神的计划包括我们的选择。宿命论不包括我们在宿命论体系中的选择。

- 基督教说一切都是神计划的一部分，包括你的选择。

#### 3. 坏事

神憎恨坏事，但祂将坏事纳入祂的计划。祂将它们编织进祂的计划中。

- 万事都互相效力，为要叫爱神的人得益处。

**神的计划包括一切，因此包括小事、选择和坏事。**

### 神的王权的实际意义

如果你理解神的计划包括坏事，神的计划包括你的选择，神的计划包括小事，并且神的整个计划是控制每一个事件，以达到使耶稣基督成为一切之王并治愈宇宙的目标，那么你就理解了护理的教义。

- 它会让你变得勇敢。
- 它会带来满足感。
- 它会让你谦卑。

**要么宇宙中的每一个分子都是为你，要么每一个分子都是反对你。**
