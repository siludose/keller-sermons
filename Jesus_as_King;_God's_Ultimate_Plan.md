## English Transcript / 英文原文

today's teaching, Tim Keller impacts how Jesus actively seeks us, reveals truth to  us, and calls us to Himself. We've been looking all month at aspects of who Jesus is, and today we're going to look  at what it means to say Jesus as a king. And this subject, by the way, just to remind you, this subject, I mean, I've already preached  this sermon once, and I think I probably scare a few more snakes out of the bushes  than I actually kill in the process of this sermon. So it might be a good day to follow me downstairs as we usually do after the 4 o'clock service  to the East Lounge, after the service, after the post-lude, and we have questions and  answers. So surely I'm going to scare out a couple of snakes that, at least to your satisfaction,  I don't really nail in the course of the sermon, so jot your questions down, think about  it, and come on down and we'll have questions and answers afterwards.

For now, Ephesians 1, and we read, and He made known to us the mystery of His will according  to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Christ to be put into effect when the times  will have reached their fulfillment, to bring all things in heaven and on earth together  under one head, even Christ. In Him, we also were chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of Him, who works  out everything in conformity with the purpose of His will, in order that we, who were the  first to hope in Christ, might be for the praise of His glory. This is God's Word. If you were to take a person out of the heart of the South American rain forest, it had  never been anywhere else and put him down in the middle of time square, it would look chaotic  and crazy to him. He would want to know why are people rushing down into the belly of the earth through these  stairways.

He would want to know why these strange metallic looking animals were whizzing by on the  roads, and why people were hailing the yellow ones and letting them devour them right on  the spot. There would be all kinds of problems that this man would have. It would look chaotic and crazy because he wouldn't see the purpose to it. This world would seem full of senseless components. Now if you've lived in New York for a while, Times Square doesn't look quite that senseless  though it's a little senseless still.

But I would propose to you that that image is a good illustration of how many people increasingly  see their lives as time goes on. The older you get, the more you see that life doesn't seem to go by the rules. When you start out, when you're young, when you're in college, there's things that you're  sure will never happen to you or things that you will never do. There's rules, you see. None of your friends would ever do this.

And as time goes by, you begin to wonder what rules there are. Nice guys finish last the good day, die young, and all that. They happen. That happens. And at a practical level, people, as they get older, begin to wonder about whether there's  any rhyme or reason to it, intellectually, that's certainly true, increasingly, in the  intellectual world.

There are more thinkers are saying that the universe actually has randomness at its root,  that the old scientific view of the universe, that it was a kind of the mechanistic view,  the view that there's all these laws that have to be followed consistently, knows as people  like Stephen Hawking and a whole lot of other people and a whole lot of other realms. They're saying there is no rhyme or reason to it. Life is chaotic, history is chaotic. It's nothing but disorder. That's both a practical and an intellectual perception today.

Christianity, though, has, I would say, the most wonderful, the most sophisticated, and  the most decisive answer to that perception. And the answer is really in the text that we've just read. Jesus is king. In other words, if you went up to that poor guy from the South American rainforest, wandering  around Times Square, having a fit, you'd stop him, you'd sit him down and he'd say calm  down. I can explain.

You probably couldn't explain it very quickly. He has a long way to go to understand what a subway is, you see. What electricity is, maybe, but you could say calm down. There's an explanation. Well, the Bible comes, and it says to us, when we see our lives and history looking chaotic,  it says calm down.

There's an explanation. And though it's not something that, again, just in the same way, the Bible says, I can't  explain it all to you overnight, but the key to it all is the kingship of Christ. And let me show you how this answers this perception, how this is the most sophisticated  and wonderful and decisive answer to the apparent chaos of history. The Bible says, first of all, the kingship of Christ has two aspects, and these two aspects  have to be in your mind understood and maintained as distinct but not separate. Distinct but not separate.

If you don't understand the two sides of this kingship, and if you don't understand  that they're not identical, but they exist together, if you don't understand both of them  and see them as distinct but not separate, your life and history will look like timesquare  to that poor guy. And let me explain what the two are. They're right here in the text. The first one is in the first part. It says, the mystery of his will, his good pleasure to bring all things in heaven on earth  together under one head, even Christ.

Now this is talking about the coming kingdom. Jesus Christ has a kingdom coming. His kingdom has a future aspect. I still think probably the best way to explain that is with this illustration. God invented the universe, the way a clockmaker invents a clock, except that God put himself  into the clock.

God made the universe in the beginning kind of the way a clockmaker makes a clock, but  God put himself into the clock. And we humanity, you might say, was the key cog. If you could open up the back of the clock. If the universe was a clock and you could open up the back, the way it was originally designed,  there was humanity right in the center, meshing with God above and meshing with nature beneath. We were the vice regents of the world, God's vice regents in nature, but when we decided  to take the vice out of vice region, when we decided we wanted to be our own regents,  we wanted to be our own kings, we wanted to be our own masters.

That was like a cog falling out, falling off of its axle down into all of the wheels  below. What happened to the universe, the moment we decided to be our own directors, to be our  own regents, what happened to the universe is exactly what would happen to a clock if  that happened, and that is the universe began to smoke and grind and crack and splinter. And there were coils and springs and levers flying off in every direction, see. In other words, the universe began to disintegrate. One thing that I think every scientist, every physicist, maybe even every psychologist I  hope, certainly every biblical theologian will say is it is the nature of life and it's  the nature of the universe in all of its aspects physically, socially, spiritually, culturally  to deteriorate.

Everything is decaying, everything's in the process of falling apart, everything is disintegrating,  everything is unraveling, because that cog has fallen off of the axle down into the  bottom of the clock and everything is groaning and everything is crunching and things aren't  working right. And so disease and decay comes in and injustice and oppression comes in and fear and guilt  come in all because we aren't meshed with our king above. Now, God, we're told in the Bible and just look at history, God has allowed the tragedy  work itself out. We're free moral agents. He's let it happen.

He's let us take the consequences, but he promised not to let us stew in our juices forever. He promised not to let us die forever. He promised that someday he'd come back and that he would set up his kingdom anew and  he would put humanity back on the axle and he'd mesh with us again from above. And when that happens, everything would be healed, physically and socially and spiritually  in every way. Everything would come together again.

That's what Paul's talking about, right here, because you see, he says, this is the  great plan. This is the mystery of his will, according to his pleasure. To be put into effect when the times will have reached their fulfillment. This is God's ultimate purpose. This is the point of history, right?

To bring all things in heaven and on earth together under one head, Christ. That means everything is disunited. Everything is disintegrating. It's going to be brought together. It's going to become whole.

Our bodies, instead of breaking apart as they get older, we're going to be made whole. Our souls, instead of breaking apart, will be made whole. Our relationships, everything is united under one head. This idea of head, that means Christ is king. And head of the world, that's a moment in the future.

When everything is reached his fulfillment, everything will be united. Everything will be healed. He'll be the head. And the universe, again, will be, in a sense, his body. And what is a body?

It's an integrated whole of interlocking organic systems, you see, instead of just a bunch  of wheels and pulleys that are all fighting against each other, which is the way the universe  is now. That is God's ultimate purpose. When the time is fulfilled, Jesus Christ will be king of all. All the resistance will be put down. He will put us back on the axle, and he'll begin to mesh with us again from above.

And when that happens, we don't really know what it's going to be like. But it's usually worth spending a few moments everyday meditating on what it's going to be like. All we know is paradoxical, magnificent metaphors. We know that when he becomes head and king overall, death will die. Decay will finally decay.

This unity will disunite. Sickness will get terminally ill. Endings will be ended. Violence will be violated. Disruption will be destroyed.

Stuff like that. I has not seen nor ear heard nor has it entered into the heart. What he has in store for those who love him. I just love that place where Luke Skywalker says to Han Solo, he says, we need to go  rescue the princess, you know why? Because she's rich, really how rich, he says, more than you can imagine.

Han Solo turns around and says, I can imagine an awful lot. We can imagine an awful lot. So imagine what it must be that would be in store for us when on that day, when God says  you can't imagine, I has not seen nor ear heard nor has it entered into your heart. You have no idea. You can imagine a lot of joy, can't you?

No, you can't. Nothing compared to it. On the day in which he is made head overall, that's what will happen. Now, but that's only one aspect of his kingship. He is going to take up his kingship.

He's going to have a future and complete kingship, but then there's a second aspect of his kingship  that's mentioned here. We've already alluded to it, and that is he is king right now of history. He may not have put down all resistance to himself yet in the world. He may not have put down all resistance to himself yet in humanity. But history has no resistance to him.

He is a complete charge of every event of history. You see, the whole point of history is it says that when the times have reached their  fulfillment to bring all things together in Christ and he says, in him we were chosen according  to the plan of him who works out everything, everything, all things in conformity with  the purpose of his will. The old authorizer isn't used to say he works together all things according to the counsel  of his will. Now you see, these two aspects of the kingship of Christ have to be brought together or  you won't understand your life. Paul brings them together at the end of Ephesians 1 where he says, and I quote, and God placed  all things under his feet and appointed him head over everything for the church, his  body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.

Now what is this saying? It is saying that though you don't see Jesus Christ crowned yet overall, you don't see  him having put down all resistance to his royal will. And therefore you see brokenness, you see physical imperfection, you see pain, you see  suffering everywhere, but right now history is being steered by the king. Jesus Christ you might say is in the driver's seat of history. He's steering it toward that omega point which is actually the alpha point, the place in  which he fills all in all.

And so everything that happens now, every single thing, every event, we'll get to that  later here, every event is under his control and is part of what this passage calls in  Greek, his plan, his purpose, his boulain, it's his plan, he's got a blueprint, and he's  working out right now his lordship over history so that he can affect then his complete  lordship and his complete healing of the universe. Now unless you get these two things together, together, life will seem crazy. So for example, somebody says, well, wait a minute, if God, if Jesus Christ is king over  everything and everything that's happening is happening according to his plan, that means  he planned that earthquake, where the roofs fell in and all those poor people died in  their sleep. If God is king, if Jesus is king, why is there suffering? Now you see, that question forgets how sophisticated this answer is, Jesus' kingship does not have  one aspect, it has two.

He has got right now a plan to get us to the place where there's no more earthquakes. He's got a plan for history to get us to the place where there's no more killing, there's  no more murder, there's no more death, there's no more anything. And yet he's taking us there because many things have to happen before we get to that point. Well, what? Now, if we lived 2500 years ago, one thing we wouldn't have known anything about was the crucifixion.

We wouldn't have understood it. We wouldn't have known that Jesus Christ had a common die. If He hadn't died and He hadn't paid for the sins of those who believed in what would  have happened is, of course, God could not deal with us in an appropriate way. We didn't know that. Now we do.

But there are many other things all on that road. In other words, God's taking us to a place where there is no pain. But the road to get to the place where there is no pain passes through pain. The road to the crown goes through the cross. It had been for Jesus and it happens for us.

At a certain level, we know this. Many of us, especially as we get older, realize that it's only the most shallow that a life  without troubles creates shallowness. A life without failures creates superficiality. I mean, intuitively, you realize there wasn't for our troubles. We wouldn't know much about ourselves.

In many cases, there wasn't for our troubles. We wouldn't know much about. We wouldn't know God. There's all sorts of hints. We don't understand it completely.

But we're told. There's two aspects to his kinship. He's steering us to the place where there's no more earthquakes. Yet he takes us through earthquakes on the road to get there. He's steering us to the place where there's no more crosses, where there's nothing but  crowns, but on the way, he himself had to go through a cross.

I was reading a book recently by a British author named John Stott and John Stott said  it this way. He said, one of the main reasons I'm a Christian is this. He says, the world is so full of suffering and pain. The world is so full of evil and broken is that I could not believe in a God who had  never suffered himself. I could not believe in a God who hadn't suffered and gone to the cross.

And he says, one of the reasons I'm a Christian is there's no other religion that offers you  a God who's suffered. You see, God hates the earthquake. We're told that. And yet it's woven into his plan. Why somebody says, listen, if he's really the king, why does he have to take his time?

What are you telling me about? Why does it have to take his time? I don't completely know. But I know, but that question probably sounds like this to God. If your, most fathers have had this experience, you have a little kid three or four years  old, and you say we're going to see grandmommy and granddaddy.

Let's get in the car. I could say, yay, they get in the car, and you're on your way, and after five minutes,  kids says, are we there yet, daddy? And you say, no, we're not there. Why not? I'm tired.

I want to be there. You told me you were going to take me there. Why is it taking so long? Now, you say, all right, honey, it's 350 miles to grandmommy and granddaddy's house. We have been going for five minutes.

It's going to take a lot longer, and says, why don't you go faster, says the child? You could go faster. I mean, you see, you know, you're all powerful, father. You could go faster. So you tried to explain to a four-year-old child some of the laws of elementary physics.

He doesn't want to hear it. He says, you're just being mean, and at a certain point, what do you say to a kid? You say, honey, you're four years old, you don't understand physics, I'm sorry. But all I can tell you is fasten your seatbelt and be quiet. And you see, you know, there's an awful lot of very learned discourses, objecting to  the very existence of God on the basis that if he really worked king, and if he was really  taking us to the place where all the earthquakes would be gone, why aren't we there yet?

Very learned, very wonderful. You see, very, very detailed. And yet basically, it boils down to, are we there yet daddy? Why not? Why couldn't you be going faster?

And because I can't understand something, probably to God's mind, is as simple as elementary  physics as to our mind. Because I can't understand that. Therefore maybe there's no God at all. That's the normal response, but don't you see? If Jesus Christ is king, it makes sense that not everything makes sense.

If we relate to Him, even like my four-year-old son relates to me, it would make sense that  not everything would make sense, if it made sense, it would make sense. You see, this is such a sensible mystery, this great doctrine, that he's in charge, we  don't understand everything. But he says, I'm taking you to that place where Jesus will fill all and all, and all things  will be united. Meanwhile, everything that happens, all things are happening to get you to that place. Everything that happens, everything is designed to get us to the place where Jesus Christ is  king of all.

Now what does that mean? Let's break it down practically. We just showed you why God controls history. He's trying to get us to the place where Jesus is king of all. But how does he control history?

If you take a look at this, the version that we have printed here says, he works everything  in conformity with the purpose of his will, and I would like to meditate with you a minute  on that, to show you how this doctrine is called, historically it's been called the doctrine  of God's providence. The doctrine of God's providence, where the word providence comes from, the word provide,  which means that everything that happens is God's provision. And this doctrine is unique. It's different than humanism, it's different than secularism, it's different than Islam,  it's different than other, it than Buddhism and Eastern religions, it's unique. And it all is tied up in this word, everything.

And I tell you, if you understand this word, everything, it'll change your life, it'll  change your attitude, it'll change the way in which you handle life tomorrow. If you understand how he's exercising his kingship through providence, if you understand  that everything works together according to the counsel of his will, the purpose of his  will, it will change the way you live. Let me show you. First of all, what's the word, everything mean? It means three things, A, it means, everything means God's plan includes little things.

God's plan includes little things, it has to. Most of us don't think of it this way, everything. It says in Proverbs 16, the lot is cast into the lap, but the disposal is the Lord's. That means even when you flip a coin, if it comes down heads or it comes down tails, it  was part of his plan. Nothing is left out of his plan.

You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger brother. In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who  try to earn his love by being good. In his book, The prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart  of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental  older brother and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal, extravagant grace. Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith, The prodigal God will help  you see a relationship with Christ in a whole new way. The prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month, to help gospel and life share  the hope and joy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the  world.

Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash give, that's gospelandlife.com slash  give. Okay, that's the first thing I want to stress, let me push it a little bit. People say, come on, nothing. You're telling me that the tie that Tim Keller was wearing today was part of God's plan  from all eternity. You're trying to tell me the shoes that I decided to wear today was part of God's plan.

Little things like that, well, they're only little things to you and me because we're  so unwise. There are no little things. Now, Teddy Roosevelt in 1912, somebody tried to shoot Teddy Roosevelt and they did  shot him in the chest. You know why he lived? Because he happened to have his glasses case on this side instead of this side.

Your marriages, in many cases, your careers, what school you go to, very often are based  on so-called little things. I can give you a quick example. I didn't do it this morning but my wife told me I must tell her the four o'clock service  even if you've heard the story before because of perfect example. And the only, the reason that I'm a Presbyterian minister was because of a particular faculty  member that came to my seminary my last semester and pushed me over the edge. When it came to my theological understanding and I decided, yeah, I think I need to be  a Presbyterian.

That's the reason I'm here today. Why did he come? The only reason he came that year was because somebody he was trying, he was British and  he was having a lot of trouble getting a passport to come and teach at my seminarian  Massachusetts, but somebody pulled strings for him. Yeah, from real high up. He remembers one day, every day he'd go to the American Embassy and he'd stand this  long line and he says, I'm never going to get a passport, I'm never going to, but you  know, one of the problems back then was he had to prove that an American citizen couldn't  do the job as well as he could to get this job and it was a very long process and one  day somebody came out looking for him, calling his name out, somebody came out when he was  standing in this long line and called him in and says, you're going to be an American  within a week.

We got word from real high up. Well, you know who that was. It was a guy named Mike Ford. Mike Ford was the president of the, was the son of the president at the time. Mike Ford was the son of Gerald Ford and he was a student at Gordon Conwell Seminary where  I was and he found a way to get this particular faculty member to Gordon Conwell because his  father was a president.

You know why his father was president? Because of Watergate. You know, because of the Watergate scandal, Nixon had resigned and Gerald Ford was  the president. The reason that Mike Ford had the clout to get this guy over there, that's the reason  why he was there. That's the reason I became a Presbyterian.

That's the reason I'm talking to you right now. Well why did Nixon fall? Because some stupid Watergate burglar left the door open one night and some guard noticed  that the door was open. Now, what if that guard hadn't gone by that day? Maybe he went by that day because that morning he didn't eat breakfast and he got in a little  bit early.

You see, I wouldn't be here if that guard hadn't seen. That door open. That's the way everything in your life is. Ray Bradbury had it figured out. Ray Bradbury has one great story about the future, about a time travel.

And he has this one story about how when people would go back into time, they had to be  very careful to walk on a magnetic field and not touch anything. Otherwise everything would change and one of the stories, one of the time travelers accidentally  slips and falls off the magnetic field and steps on a butterfly. That kills it and everything changes, the rest of the universe, the rest of history changes  forever. Everything's interlocked. It's silly not, you know, when people say, you mean, God has planned everything out.

If you think you'll realize there is no other way, can you imagine the terror that a thoughtful  person would get up out of the bed every day with knowing that there was such a thing  as a chance? Anything could happen. Knowing that the tiniest little thing could completely change everything about your  life, completely change civilization. God's plan includes everything therein lies your security. Okay, secondly, the word everything means God's plan also includes our choices.

How does this something that people have trouble with, right? The first point I just made was that God's plan includes little things. Every little thing, everything is part of his plan. It says everything works out according to his plan. Well, your first reaction is, that's terrible.

That means that we're all faded to do things and we have no freedom and there's no freedom. That's not true. As a matter of fact, it's not true because of this word everything. My second point here is that God's plan includes our choices. Fatalism.

Listen, the Greeks taught fatalism, the Romans taught fatalism, the Muslims teach fatalism  of a sort, a kismet. But fatalism does not include our choices in a fatalistic system of thought. Everything is fixed except our choices. Let me give you an example. In all the Greek myths, if a prophecy comes and says this woman or this man is destined  is faded to be a criminal.

If that poor person spends years trying to be good, trying to live a good life, trying  to avoid a life of crime, it won't matter why. Because you see in the Greek worldview, in the fatalistic worldview, if you're faded  to be a criminal, it doesn't matter what you do. You are faded in spite of your choices. No matter how hard you try to be good, you are faded, you are destined to be a criminal. And that's the way fatalism works.

In other words, everything is fixed except your choices. You can do anything with your choices, but it doesn't matter. But Christianity is different, Christianity says everything is part of God's plan, including  your choices. The plan is fixed through your choices, including your choices, not in spite of which  means something very simple and yet very profound, very mysterious and yet very sensible. It simply means that your choices are always part of the plan.

Here's Jacob. Jacob sins against his father and he robs his brother. As a result, he has to leave and live in a foreign land and he has a very miserable life. And yet, he meets the love of his life in that foreign land, Rachel. They have their children through whom the Messiah Jesus Christ has ascended.

So it's very clear that Jacob had to sin and had to go to that foreign land for Jesus  to be born. And Jesus obviously was planned by God, right? Yes. So the sin was planned, right? Yes, of course.

And yet the sin was free. The sin was responsible. Nobody coerced him and yet it was part of the plan. And the bad consequences that came into his life happened because of the plan. And because of the choice, it all works together.

Jacob was completely free and completely responsible and yet every single thing that happened  to him was part of the plan. All at once. God is in control. We are free. Why?

Because everything is part of the plan. God never fixes our fate despite our choices. You know, Charles Spurgeon had that great story, used to tell. He went by, Charles Spurgeon believed all this. He was a Baptist preacher.

He went to see a friend of his who was sick and he says, how are you doing? And the friend says, oh, I don't know if I should take my medicine. And Spurgeon says, why? And he says, well, he says, I don't know whether God has destined me to live or die. And Spurgeon says, you know, now Spurgeon could have lectured and said, okay, in the Greek  idea of fate, if you're going to die, it doesn't matter what you do.

Not in the Christian view. Oh, no, your choices are always linked to the plan. And so what did he say? He says, my dear friend, I can tell you exactly what's going to happen. If you take your medicine, you're destined to live.

If you don't take your medicine, you're destined to die. Because everything, everything, is part of his plan. This makes perfect sense even though you can't quite always, you know, kind of work the  thing out. There's a great place in the book of Acts, Acts chapter 27, in which Paul's on a ship. And the ship is in a terrible storm.

And Paul gets up and says, God has shown me that no one on this ship will lose their  lives, but we will lose the ship. We're going to be shipwreck, but no one will lose their life. God has spoken. Okay, it's a prophecy. All right.

And yet, at one point, the soldiers try to get into the lifeboats. And Paul runs over and says, if you get in the lifeboats, we'll all die. Don't get in the lifeboats. This is like three verses after he just said, God has said, no one will perish. So what did they do?

They said, okay, Paul says, don't do it, or we'll be killed. And yet, of course, nobody perished. Why? Because you see, God never fixes our fate despite our choices, but through our choices. Because unlike fatalism, everything is part of his plan.

And that means friends, when you make a choice, when you've got a choice before you, make  it well. Don't shrug and say it doesn't matter. Because if you make a good choice, you'll be in good shape. If you make a bad choice, all kinds of terrible consequences will happen. And yet, knowing that, on the other hand, the wonderful thing about this great doctrine  is, and yet, you have to realize you can't screw your life up, past what God has in store  for you.

And he says, his will for you is he loves you. You can't do something, and then, and frustrate God, you see? God's never looking down at you and saying, oh my gosh, what did she do that for? Now what am I going to do? I guess I guess I could have her marry this guy instead, but I don't know.

You know, that's not way God operates. You make a bad choice, you've made a bad choice. You make a bad choice. You do something stupid, you do something rash, you do something wicked. There will be consequences, and yet, and yet, everything is part of this plan.

You can't muck up your life. He's working in it, but lastly, his plan includes everything, therefore, little things. His plan includes everything, therefore, choices. But God's plan includes everything. His control, his kingship over history, includes everything, including bad things.

And I know this is the toughest one, but let me tell you a story to explain. God hates the bad things, and yet, he includes the bad things. He weaves them into his plan. Why, somebody says? Well, we already, I went through it once and told you that it partly, it's a mystery.

Partly, this is a place where you have to say, I'm a child, you're a father, okay? I don't understand why we can't be a grandma so quickly, but on the other hand,  I understand that you're the father, all right, I'll tighten my seatbelt, and I'll be quiet. And yet, fortunately, the Bible gives us more than that, doesn't treat us as babies. It gives us some wonderful stories. Let me give you an example.

All things work together according to the Council of his will, or Romans 8.28, all things  work together for good to those who love God. One essential story of this is the story of Jacob and Joseph. Jacob was a patriarch. Jacob was a man who had 12 sons, and he did the stupidest thing that a father can do. He set his heart on one of his 12 sons, Joseph.

He doted on that little boy. He doted on that young man, and he was clearly in love with the kid, and he was clearly  the favorite, and there's nothing that can inject pain into a family worse than that. And it did. As Joseph grew up, because he was indulged, and because he was centered on, he was becoming  an arrogant kid, he was becoming a superficial and empty person, he was becoming the kind  of superficial and empty person that always comes out of such an indulgent environment. Meanwhile, the other brothers were turning into alienated and resentful kids, and alienated  resentful young men, and finally their resentment grew to the place where they became capable  of a horrible thing.

The kidnap Joseph, they put him into a pit, and they sold him into slavery, and they  told his father he was dead, that an animal had killed him. And his father, because Joseph was his god, Joseph was his idol, his father lost all hope,  and went into depression for years. The sons who had done this, the brothers who had done this, lived with a guilt, and over  the years it became unbearable, and they became alienated from each other, and their father  and their life was miserable. But Joseph did not die, he was sold into slavery, and in the hardship of slavery, and in the  hard knocks of Egypt he got what his father never could have given him, Jacob never could have  given it to him, character, grit, savvy, wit, and he learned to cling to God. And eventually this brought out the potential in Joseph, he never would have happened  if he stayed at home, it brought out the potential, and eventually he came to the place where  he rose up to become prime minister of Egypt.

And with his foresight he realized that a famine was coming and he created a grain reserve  program, so that when the famine hit, instead of everybody starving to death, he was in charge  of giving out the grain from the years of plenty, so that the people during the years of famine  weren't starving. While the famine stretched all the way up to the place where Jacob and the 11 remaining  brothers lived, and Jacob sent ten of the brothers down to Egypt to get grain and to get  food so they wouldn't starve. And when they see Joseph, Joseph recognizes them, but Joseph is hidden to them, they don't  recognize him. Joseph can't believe it when he sees his brothers. He wants to have revenge, but he wants to test them.

So he says, who are you? They explain. We're from a far country where twelve brothers, one of them is dead, one is at home with  our father, who's elderly. Your spy, as he says. You're here to spy us out and give information to invading countries.

No, no, no, not a bit. Not at all, they say. That's not true. We're really brothers. Okay, I'll tell you what I'll do, says the prime minister.

I'm going to keep one of your brothers, I'm going to keep Simeon, I'm going to put him  in jail here. I'm going to send you home with just a little food, but if you want more food, if you want  to not starve, you've got to prove that you are really a family, bring that youngest  son Benjamin back, that you tell me about, bring him here, then I'll know you're telling  the truth, but if you don't come back with Benjamin, you'll never see my face again. You'll never get grain here, you'll all starve. So sadly, they go back to Jacob and they say, father, we've got a little bit of food,  but if we're going to go back again, we've got to take Benjamin. And at that point, Jacob, you see, cries out.

And in Genesis chapter 42, verse 36, he cries a cry that I believe is the quintessential  cry of a person looking at life without seeing it through the kingship of Christ. He says, I say, we've got to take Benjamin back, we've got to go back. And he says, no, Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more. And now you would take Benjamin from me, everything is against me. Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more.

And now you would take Benjamin from me, everything is against me. And at the moment, he said that God was moving heaven and earth for Jacob. If Jacob hadn't lost Joseph, Joseph and the whole family would have been destroyed. If Jacob hadn't lost Joseph, the whole region would be dying of starvation. Through the incident of the loss of Joseph, God was healing Joseph.

He was humbling his brothers. He was helping the whole region economically. And he was destroying the idols that were ruining and distorting Jacob's life. God was moving everything, moving heaven and earth for Jacob. But is that what Jacob thought?

No, what did he say? Everything is against me. Joseph is no more. But Joseph was just being hidden from him, he was in preparation. Simeon is no more.

Simeon was really fine, he was in preparation. Everything is against me. That's how your life will always look, if you refuse to believe that God knows more than you. If you refuse to believe he's king, if you refuse to believe he's good,  then how about you? How do you feel when you look at your life right now?

Do you feel that way? What's the cry of your heart? You say, I'm never going to find love now. I'm never going to find success now. These things are no more.

And everything is against me. Is that how you feel? What's understandable? I mean, look at Jacob, that's how he felt, that's how he saw things. He was a patriarch, he was no idiot.

He wasn't stupid and neither are you to feel that way. But you're wrong. You're wrong. Be careful. Look in the mirror of that cry.

Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more. You're going to take Benjamin from me, everything is against me. Look in that cry, there's a mirror there. And so I don't want to be like that. I don't want to say that.

Friends, if you understand that God's plan includes bad things, that God's plan includes  your choices, that God's plan includes little things, and that all of God's plan is controlling  every single event to the end and to the goal of making Jesus Christ all in all and king  of all healing the universe, then you understand the doctrine of providence. And if you understand it and you begin to operate on this, on that wavelength, you begin  to remind yourself of these things all the time. What will that do to you? Well, I'll just close by saying it'll have three effects. One is it'll make you feisty, feisty.

You see, if you believe that God hates the evil as much as you do, and that though it's  in store, you're going to get hurt, you're going to be hurt, you're going to find all  sorts of bad things happening to you and around you. But you know that you can lose a battle, but you can't lose a war. See, the pagan notion of evil is that's it, except it. And the modern notion of evil is it's random, let's fight against it. But Christians understand that we fight with hope.

There's a feistiness, you know, the latest, the last twilight Paris album has it's, I  think it's the first song on the first side, a song God is in control, oh, it's not the  greatest work of art, but the feistiness is in the lyrics. And the chorus goes, God is in control. We believe that his children will not be forsaken. God is in control. We choose to believe, we choose to remember and never be shaken.

We choose to remember and never be shaken. There is no power above or beside him. We know God is in control. There's a feistiness, you know, in your face evil. We choose to remember and never be shaken.

It's your choice. There's a feistiness, secondly, there's also a kind of contentment because even when things  go bad, you know what God's doing to you. There's this great little book for children called the Velveteen Rabbit and in one place  in the Velveteen Rabbit, these two animals, stuffed animals, two toys in the nursery are  talking to each other. And the one toy says to the other toy, what does it mean to get real? Well, it says the skin horse.

It's a thing that happens to you when a child loves you for a long, long, long time. Not just to play with, but really loves you, you become real. It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges or who  have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you're real, most of your hair has been loved off and your eyes  have dropped out and you get all loose in the joints and you're very shabby, but these  things don't matter at all because once you're real, you can't be ugly except to people  who don't understand.

You see, if you understand the doctrine of Christ's kingship, you know that everything that's  happening to you is God's way of making you real, even if your hair is loved off or your  eyes are fallen out of you, feeling kind of shabby and you know the stuffing is coming  out the back. But you see, there's a contentment because you know that this is part of his plan that  includes everything. But lastly, and this is something of a warning, the doctrine of God's providence humbles us. Because you know the promise is all things work together for good to those who love God. Now, do you know what that means?

All things work together for good to those who love God. What does that mean? It means this. Very important. Last thing I'm going to say, very critical, hope you wake up now, okay?

If everything that happens happens to the goal to make Christ king, right? Everything that's happening is happening to that end. That means that if you have made Christ king of your life, if you've made him save your  and king, if that's the thing you're living for, if that's the preeminent desire of your  life, then everything that happens in the world, every grain of sand, every atom, every  molecule, every event is for you. All things work together for good to those who love God. But if on the other hand, you're living as your own king, if you rejected the kingship  of Christ, you might be religious, but you're your own master, you decide and you call the  shots.

If you're working against his kingship, that means that every event in the universe is  against you and there's no in between. Either every molecule in the universe is for you or every molecule in the universe is against  you. You can see it. Do you make Jesus king? Then what?

No matter good or bad things that happen to you, it's moving him more toward him, toward  it. You know, when good things happen, you're closer to God because you're so grateful. When bad things happen, you're closer to God. Why? Because it shows you how much you need him.

But now let's take a look at a person who's rejected the kingship of Christ. Good and bad things, the good things just make this person feel that I don't need God. And the bad things make the person feel I can't trust him. So whether a good or bad happens to a person who is not submitted to the kingship of Christ,  everything that happens, everything good or bad or indifferent is hardening you, pushing  you away, moving you away. You can have a universe in which every atom is for you and every atom is against you,  but there's nothing in the middle.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today's teaching, Tim Keller impacts how Jesus actively seeks us, reveals truth to  us, and calls us to Himself. We've been looking all month at aspects of who Jesus is, and today we're going to look  at what it means to say Jesus as a king. And this subject, by the way, just to remind you, this subject, I mean, I've already preached  this sermon once, and I think I probably scare a few more snakes out of the bushes  than I actually kill in the process of this sermon. So it might be a good day to follow me downstairs as we usually do after the 4 o'clock service  to the East Lounge, after the service, after the post-lude, and we have questions and  answers. So surely I'm going to scare out a couple of snakes that, at least to your satisfaction,  I don't really nail in the course of the sermon, so jot your questions down, think about  it, and come on down and we'll have questions and answers afterwards.

For now, Ephesians 1, and we read, and He made known to us the mystery of His will according  to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Christ to be put into effect when the times  will have reached their fulfillment, to bring all things in heaven and on earth together  under one head, even Christ. In Him, we also were chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of Him, who works  out everything in conformity with the purpose of His will, in order that we, who were the  first to hope in Christ, might be for the praise of His glory. This is God's Word. If you were to take a person out of the heart of the South American rain forest, it had  never been anywhere else and put him down in the middle of time square, it would look chaotic  and crazy to him. He would want to know why are people rushing down into the belly of the earth through these  stairways.

He would want to know why these strange metallic looking animals were whizzing by on the  roads, and why people were hailing the yellow ones and letting them devour them right on  the spot. There would be all kinds of problems that this man would have. It would look chaotic and crazy because he wouldn't see the purpose to it. This world would seem full of senseless components. Now if you've lived in New York for a while, Times Square doesn't look quite that senseless  though it's a little senseless still.

But I would propose to you that that image is a good illustration of how many people increasingly  see their lives as time goes on. The older you get, the more you see that life doesn't seem to go by the rules. When you start out, when you're young, when you're in college, there's things that you're  sure will never happen to you or things that you will never do. There's rules, you see. None of your friends would ever do this.

And as time goes by, you begin to wonder what rules there are. Nice guys finish last the good day, die young, and all that. They happen. That happens. And at a practical level, people, as they get older, begin to wonder about whether there's  any rhyme or reason to it, intellectually, that's certainly true, increasingly, in the  intellectual world.

There are more thinkers are saying that the universe actually has randomness at its root,  that the old scientific view of the universe, that it was a kind of the mechanistic view,  the view that there's all these laws that have to be followed consistently, knows as people  like Stephen Hawking and a whole lot of other people and a whole lot of other realms. They're saying there is no rhyme or reason to it. Life is chaotic, history is chaotic. It's nothing but disorder. That's both a practical and an intellectual perception today.

Christianity, though, has, I would say, the most wonderful, the most sophisticated, and  the most decisive answer to that perception. And the answer is really in the text that we've just read. Jesus is king. In other words, if you went up to that poor guy from the South American rainforest, wandering  around Times Square, having a fit, you'd stop him, you'd sit him down and he'd say calm  down. I can explain.

You probably couldn't explain it very quickly. He has a long way to go to understand what a subway is, you see. What electricity is, maybe, but you could say calm down. There's an explanation. Well, the Bible comes, and it says to us, when we see our lives and history looking chaotic,  it says calm down.

There's an explanation. And though it's not something that, again, just in the same way, the Bible says, I can't  explain it all to you overnight, but the key to it all is the kingship of Christ. And let me show you how this answers this perception, how this is the most sophisticated  and wonderful and decisive answer to the apparent chaos of history. The Bible says, first of all, the kingship of Christ has two aspects, and these two aspects  have to be in your mind understood and maintained as distinct but not separate. Distinct but not separate.

If you don't understand the two sides of this kingship, and if you don't understand  that they're not identical, but they exist together, if you don't understand both of them  and see them as distinct but not separate, your life and history will look like timesquare  to that poor guy. And let me explain what the two are. They're right here in the text. The first one is in the first part. It says, the mystery of his will, his good pleasure to bring all things in heaven on earth  together under one head, even Christ.

Now this is talking about the coming kingdom. Jesus Christ has a kingdom coming. His kingdom has a future aspect. I still think probably the best way to explain that is with this illustration. God invented the universe, the way a clockmaker invents a clock, except that God put himself  into the clock.

God made the universe in the beginning kind of the way a clockmaker makes a clock, but  God put himself into the clock. And we humanity, you might say, was the key cog. If you could open up the back of the clock. If the universe was a clock and you could open up the back, the way it was originally designed,  there was humanity right in the center, meshing with God above and meshing with nature beneath. We were the vice regents of the world, God's vice regents in nature, but when we decided  to take the vice out of vice region, when we decided we wanted to be our own regents,  we wanted to be our own kings, we wanted to be our own masters.

That was like a cog falling out, falling off of its axle down into all of the wheels  below. What happened to the universe, the moment we decided to be our own directors, to be our  own regents, what happened to the universe is exactly what would happen to a clock if  that happened, and that is the universe began to smoke and grind and crack and splinter. And there were coils and springs and levers flying off in every direction, see. In other words, the universe began to disintegrate. One thing that I think every scientist, every physicist, maybe even every psychologist I  hope, certainly every biblical theologian will say is it is the nature of life and it's  the nature of the universe in all of its aspects physically, socially, spiritually, culturally  to deteriorate.

Everything is decaying, everything's in the process of falling apart, everything is disintegrating,  everything is unraveling, because that cog has fallen off of the axle down into the  bottom of the clock and everything is groaning and everything is crunching and things aren't  working right. And so disease and decay comes in and injustice and oppression comes in and fear and guilt  come in all because we aren't meshed with our king above. Now, God, we're told in the Bible and just look at history, God has allowed the tragedy  work itself out. We're free moral agents. He's let it happen.

He's let us take the consequences, but he promised not to let us stew in our juices forever. He promised not to let us die forever. He promised that someday he'd come back and that he would set up his kingdom anew and  he would put humanity back on the axle and he'd mesh with us again from above. And when that happens, everything would be healed, physically and socially and spiritually  in every way. Everything would come together again.

That's what Paul's talking about, right here, because you see, he says, this is the  great plan. This is the mystery of his will, according to his pleasure. To be put into effect when the times will have reached their fulfillment. This is God's ultimate purpose. This is the point of history, right?

To bring all things in heaven and on earth together under one head, Christ. That means everything is disunited. Everything is disintegrating. It's going to be brought together. It's going to become whole.

Our bodies, instead of breaking apart as they get older, we're going to be made whole. Our souls, instead of breaking apart, will be made whole. Our relationships, everything is united under one head. This idea of head, that means Christ is king. And head of the world, that's a moment in the future.

When everything is reached his fulfillment, everything will be united. Everything will be healed. He'll be the head. And the universe, again, will be, in a sense, his body. And what is a body?

It's an integrated whole of interlocking organic systems, you see, instead of just a bunch  of wheels and pulleys that are all fighting against each other, which is the way the universe  is now. That is God's ultimate purpose. When the time is fulfilled, Jesus Christ will be king of all. All the resistance will be put down. He will put us back on the axle, and he'll begin to mesh with us again from above.

And when that happens, we don't really know what it's going to be like. But it's usually worth spending a few moments everyday meditating on what it's going to be like. All we know is paradoxical, magnificent metaphors. We know that when he becomes head and king overall, death will die. Decay will finally decay.

This unity will disunite. Sickness will get terminally ill. Endings will be ended. Violence will be violated. Disruption will be destroyed.

Stuff like that. I has not seen nor ear heard nor has it entered into the heart. What he has in store for those who love him. I just love that place where Luke Skywalker says to Han Solo, he says, we need to go  rescue the princess, you know why? Because she's rich, really how rich, he says, more than you can imagine.

Han Solo turns around and says, I can imagine an awful lot. We can imagine an awful lot. So imagine what it must be that would be in store for us when on that day, when God says  you can't imagine, I has not seen nor ear heard nor has it entered into your heart. You have no idea. You can imagine a lot of joy, can't you?

No, you can't. Nothing compared to it. On the day in which he is made head overall, that's what will happen. Now, but that's only one aspect of his kingship. He is going to take up his kingship.

He's going to have a future and complete kingship, but then there's a second aspect of his kingship  that's mentioned here. We've already alluded to it, and that is he is king right now of history. He may not have put down all resistance to himself yet in the world. He may not have put down all resistance to himself yet in humanity. But history has no resistance to him.

He is a complete charge of every event of history. You see, the whole point of history is it says that when the times have reached their  fulfillment to bring all things together in Christ and he says, in him we were chosen according  to the plan of him who works out everything, everything, all things in conformity with  the purpose of his will. The old authorizer isn't used to say he works together all things according to the counsel  of his will. Now you see, these two aspects of the kingship of Christ have to be brought together or  you won't understand your life. Paul brings them together at the end of Ephesians 1 where he says, and I quote, and God placed  all things under his feet and appointed him head over everything for the church, his  body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.

Now what is this saying? It is saying that though you don't see Jesus Christ crowned yet overall, you don't see  him having put down all resistance to his royal will. And therefore you see brokenness, you see physical imperfection, you see pain, you see  suffering everywhere, but right now history is being steered by the king. Jesus Christ you might say is in the driver's seat of history. He's steering it toward that omega point which is actually the alpha point, the place in  which he fills all in all.

And so everything that happens now, every single thing, every event, we'll get to that  later here, every event is under his control and is part of what this passage calls in  Greek, his plan, his purpose, his boulain, it's his plan, he's got a blueprint, and he's  working out right now his lordship over history so that he can affect then his complete  lordship and his complete healing of the universe. Now unless you get these two things together, together, life will seem crazy. So for example, somebody says, well, wait a minute, if God, if Jesus Christ is king over  everything and everything that's happening is happening according to his plan, that means  he planned that earthquake, where the roofs fell in and all those poor people died in  their sleep. If God is king, if Jesus is king, why is there suffering? Now you see, that question forgets how sophisticated this answer is, Jesus' kingship does not have  one aspect, it has two.

He has got right now a plan to get us to the place where there's no more earthquakes. He's got a plan for history to get us to the place where there's no more killing, there's  no more murder, there's no more death, there's no more anything. And yet he's taking us there because many things have to happen before we get to that point. Well, what? Now, if we lived 2500 years ago, one thing we wouldn't have known anything about was the crucifixion.

We wouldn't have understood it. We wouldn't have known that Jesus Christ had a common die. If He hadn't died and He hadn't paid for the sins of those who believed in what would  have happened is, of course, God could not deal with us in an appropriate way. We didn't know that. Now we do.

But there are many other things all on that road. In other words, God's taking us to a place where there is no pain. But the road to get to the place where there is no pain passes through pain. The road to the crown goes through the cross. It had been for Jesus and it happens for us.

At a certain level, we know this. Many of us, especially as we get older, realize that it's only the most shallow that a life  without troubles creates shallowness. A life without failures creates superficiality. I mean, intuitively, you realize there wasn't for our troubles. We wouldn't know much about ourselves.

In many cases, there wasn't for our troubles. We wouldn't know much about. We wouldn't know God. There's all sorts of hints. We don't understand it completely.

But we're told. There's two aspects to his kinship. He's steering us to the place where there's no more earthquakes. Yet he takes us through earthquakes on the road to get there. He's steering us to the place where there's no more crosses, where there's nothing but  crowns, but on the way, he himself had to go through a cross.

I was reading a book recently by a British author named John Stott and John Stott said  it this way. He said, one of the main reasons I'm a Christian is this. He says, the world is so full of suffering and pain. The world is so full of evil and broken is that I could not believe in a God who had  never suffered himself. I could not believe in a God who hadn't suffered and gone to the cross.

And he says, one of the reasons I'm a Christian is there's no other religion that offers you  a God who's suffered. You see, God hates the earthquake. We're told that. And yet it's woven into his plan. Why somebody says, listen, if he's really the king, why does he have to take his time?

What are you telling me about? Why does it have to take his time? I don't completely know. But I know, but that question probably sounds like this to God. If your, most fathers have had this experience, you have a little kid three or four years  old, and you say we're going to see grandmommy and granddaddy.

Let's get in the car. I could say, yay, they get in the car, and you're on your way, and after five minutes,  kids says, are we there yet, daddy? And you say, no, we're not there. Why not? I'm tired.

I want to be there. You told me you were going to take me there. Why is it taking so long? Now, you say, all right, honey, it's 350 miles to grandmommy and granddaddy's house. We have been going for five minutes.

It's going to take a lot longer, and says, why don't you go faster, says the child? You could go faster. I mean, you see, you know, you're all powerful, father. You could go faster. So you tried to explain to a four-year-old child some of the laws of elementary physics.

He doesn't want to hear it. He says, you're just being mean, and at a certain point, what do you say to a kid? You say, honey, you're four years old, you don't understand physics, I'm sorry. But all I can tell you is fasten your seatbelt and be quiet. And you see, you know, there's an awful lot of very learned discourses, objecting to  the very existence of God on the basis that if he really worked king, and if he was really  taking us to the place where all the earthquakes would be gone, why aren't we there yet?

Very learned, very wonderful. You see, very, very detailed. And yet basically, it boils down to, are we there yet daddy? Why not? Why couldn't you be going faster?

And because I can't understand something, probably to God's mind, is as simple as elementary  physics as to our mind. Because I can't understand that. Therefore maybe there's no God at all. That's the normal response, but don't you see? If Jesus Christ is king, it makes sense that not everything makes sense.

If we relate to Him, even like my four-year-old son relates to me, it would make sense that  not everything would make sense, if it made sense, it would make sense. You see, this is such a sensible mystery, this great doctrine, that he's in charge, we  don't understand everything. But he says, I'm taking you to that place where Jesus will fill all and all, and all things  will be united. Meanwhile, everything that happens, all things are happening to get you to that place. Everything that happens, everything is designed to get us to the place where Jesus Christ is  king of all.

Now what does that mean? Let's break it down practically. We just showed you why God controls history. He's trying to get us to the place where Jesus is king of all. But how does he control history?

If you take a look at this, the version that we have printed here says, he works everything  in conformity with the purpose of his will, and I would like to meditate with you a minute  on that, to show you how this doctrine is called, historically it's been called the doctrine  of God's providence. The doctrine of God's providence, where the word providence comes from, the word provide,  which means that everything that happens is God's provision. And this doctrine is unique. It's different than humanism, it's different than secularism, it's different than Islam,  it's different than other, it than Buddhism and Eastern religions, it's unique. And it all is tied up in this word, everything.

And I tell you, if you understand this word, everything, it'll change your life, it'll  change your attitude, it'll change the way in which you handle life tomorrow. If you understand how he's exercising his kingship through providence, if you understand  that everything works together according to the counsel of his will, the purpose of his  will, it will change the way you live. Let me show you. First of all, what's the word, everything mean? It means three things, A, it means, everything means God's plan includes little things.

God's plan includes little things, it has to. Most of us don't think of it this way, everything. It says in Proverbs 16, the lot is cast into the lap, but the disposal is the Lord's. That means even when you flip a coin, if it comes down heads or it comes down tails, it  was part of his plan. Nothing is left out of his plan.

You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger brother. In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who  try to earn his love by being good. In his book, The prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart  of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental  older brother and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal, extravagant grace. Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith, The prodigal God will help  you see a relationship with Christ in a whole new way. The prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month, to help gospel and life share  the hope and joy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the  world.

People say, come on, nothing. You're telling me that the tie that Tim Keller was wearing today was part of God's plan  from all eternity. You're trying to tell me the shoes that I decided to wear today was part of God's plan.

Little things like that, well, they're only little things to you and me because we're  so unwise. There are no little things. Now, Teddy Roosevelt in 1912, somebody tried to shoot Teddy Roosevelt and they did  shot him in the chest. You know why he lived? Because he happened to have his glasses case on this side instead of this side.

Your marriages, in many cases, your careers, what school you go to, very often are based  on so-called little things. I can give you a quick example. I didn't do it this morning but my wife told me I must tell her the four o'clock service  even if you've heard the story before because of perfect example. And the only, the reason that I'm a Presbyterian minister was because of a particular faculty  member that came to my seminary my last semester and pushed me over the edge. When it came to my theological understanding and I decided, yeah, I think I need to be  a Presbyterian.

That's the reason I'm here today. Why did he come? The only reason he came that year was because somebody he was trying, he was British and  he was having a lot of trouble getting a passport to come and teach at my seminarian  Massachusetts, but somebody pulled strings for him. Yeah, from real high up. He remembers one day, every day he'd go to the American Embassy and he'd stand this  long line and he says, I'm never going to get a passport, I'm never going to, but you  know, one of the problems back then was he had to prove that an American citizen couldn't  do the job as well as he could to get this job and it was a very long process and one  day somebody came out looking for him, calling his name out, somebody came out when he was  standing in this long line and called him in and says, you're going to be an American  within a week.

We got word from real high up. Well, you know who that was. It was a guy named Mike Ford. Mike Ford was the president of the, was the son of the president at the time. Mike Ford was the son of Gerald Ford and he was a student at Gordon Conwell Seminary where  I was and he found a way to get this particular faculty member to Gordon Conwell because his  father was a president.

You know why his father was president? Because of Watergate. You know, because of the Watergate scandal, Nixon had resigned and Gerald Ford was  the president. The reason that Mike Ford had the clout to get this guy over there, that's the reason  why he was there. That's the reason I became a Presbyterian.

That's the reason I'm talking to you right now. Well why did Nixon fall? Because some stupid Watergate burglar left the door open one night and some guard noticed  that the door was open. Now, what if that guard hadn't gone by that day? Maybe he went by that day because that morning he didn't eat breakfast and he got in a little  bit early.

You see, I wouldn't be here if that guard hadn't seen. That door open. That's the way everything in your life is. Ray Bradbury had it figured out. Ray Bradbury has one great story about the future, about a time travel.

And he has this one story about how when people would go back into time, they had to be  very careful to walk on a magnetic field and not touch anything. Otherwise everything would change and one of the stories, one of the time travelers accidentally  slips and falls off the magnetic field and steps on a butterfly. That kills it and everything changes, the rest of the universe, the rest of history changes  forever. Everything's interlocked. It's silly not, you know, when people say, you mean, God has planned everything out.

If you think you'll realize there is no other way, can you imagine the terror that a thoughtful  person would get up out of the bed every day with knowing that there was such a thing  as a chance? Anything could happen. Knowing that the tiniest little thing could completely change everything about your  life, completely change civilization. God's plan includes everything therein lies your security. Okay, secondly, the word everything means God's plan also includes our choices.

How does this something that people have trouble with, right? The first point I just made was that God's plan includes little things. Every little thing, everything is part of his plan. It says everything works out according to his plan. Well, your first reaction is, that's terrible.

That means that we're all faded to do things and we have no freedom and there's no freedom. That's not true. As a matter of fact, it's not true because of this word everything. My second point here is that God's plan includes our choices. Fatalism.

Listen, the Greeks taught fatalism, the Romans taught fatalism, the Muslims teach fatalism  of a sort, a kismet. But fatalism does not include our choices in a fatalistic system of thought. Everything is fixed except our choices. Let me give you an example. In all the Greek myths, if a prophecy comes and says this woman or this man is destined  is faded to be a criminal.

If that poor person spends years trying to be good, trying to live a good life, trying  to avoid a life of crime, it won't matter why. Because you see in the Greek worldview, in the fatalistic worldview, if you're faded  to be a criminal, it doesn't matter what you do. You are faded in spite of your choices. No matter how hard you try to be good, you are faded, you are destined to be a criminal. And that's the way fatalism works.

In other words, everything is fixed except your choices. You can do anything with your choices, but it doesn't matter. But Christianity is different, Christianity says everything is part of God's plan, including  your choices. The plan is fixed through your choices, including your choices, not in spite of which  means something very simple and yet very profound, very mysterious and yet very sensible. It simply means that your choices are always part of the plan.

Here's Jacob. Jacob sins against his father and he robs his brother. As a result, he has to leave and live in a foreign land and he has a very miserable life. And yet, he meets the love of his life in that foreign land, Rachel. They have their children through whom the Messiah Jesus Christ has ascended.

So it's very clear that Jacob had to sin and had to go to that foreign land for Jesus  to be born. And Jesus obviously was planned by God, right? Yes. So the sin was planned, right? Yes, of course.

And yet the sin was free. The sin was responsible. Nobody coerced him and yet it was part of the plan. And the bad consequences that came into his life happened because of the plan. And because of the choice, it all works together.

Jacob was completely free and completely responsible and yet every single thing that happened  to him was part of the plan. All at once. God is in control. We are free. Why?

Because everything is part of the plan. God never fixes our fate despite our choices. You know, Charles Spurgeon had that great story, used to tell. He went by, Charles Spurgeon believed all this. He was a Baptist preacher.

He went to see a friend of his who was sick and he says, how are you doing? And the friend says, oh, I don't know if I should take my medicine. And Spurgeon says, why? And he says, well, he says, I don't know whether God has destined me to live or die. And Spurgeon says, you know, now Spurgeon could have lectured and said, okay, in the Greek  idea of fate, if you're going to die, it doesn't matter what you do.

Not in the Christian view. Oh, no, your choices are always linked to the plan. And so what did he say? He says, my dear friend, I can tell you exactly what's going to happen. If you take your medicine, you're destined to live.

If you don't take your medicine, you're destined to die. Because everything, everything, is part of his plan. This makes perfect sense even though you can't quite always, you know, kind of work the  thing out. There's a great place in the book of Acts, Acts chapter 27, in which Paul's on a ship. And the ship is in a terrible storm.

And Paul gets up and says, God has shown me that no one on this ship will lose their  lives, but we will lose the ship. We're going to be shipwreck, but no one will lose their life. God has spoken. Okay, it's a prophecy. All right.

And yet, at one point, the soldiers try to get into the lifeboats. And Paul runs over and says, if you get in the lifeboats, we'll all die. Don't get in the lifeboats. This is like three verses after he just said, God has said, no one will perish. So what did they do?

They said, okay, Paul says, don't do it, or we'll be killed. And yet, of course, nobody perished. Why? Because you see, God never fixes our fate despite our choices, but through our choices. Because unlike fatalism, everything is part of his plan.

And that means friends, when you make a choice, when you've got a choice before you, make  it well. Don't shrug and say it doesn't matter. Because if you make a good choice, you'll be in good shape. If you make a bad choice, all kinds of terrible consequences will happen. And yet, knowing that, on the other hand, the wonderful thing about this great doctrine  is, and yet, you have to realize you can't screw your life up, past what God has in store  for you.

And he says, his will for you is he loves you. You can't do something, and then, and frustrate God, you see? God's never looking down at you and saying, oh my gosh, what did she do that for? Now what am I going to do? I guess I guess I could have her marry this guy instead, but I don't know.

You know, that's not way God operates. You make a bad choice, you've made a bad choice. You make a bad choice. You do something stupid, you do something rash, you do something wicked. There will be consequences, and yet, and yet, everything is part of this plan.

You can't muck up your life. He's working in it, but lastly, his plan includes everything, therefore, little things. His plan includes everything, therefore, choices. But God's plan includes everything. His control, his kingship over history, includes everything, including bad things.

And I know this is the toughest one, but let me tell you a story to explain. God hates the bad things, and yet, he includes the bad things. He weaves them into his plan. Why, somebody says? Well, we already, I went through it once and told you that it partly, it's a mystery.

Partly, this is a place where you have to say, I'm a child, you're a father, okay? I don't understand why we can't be a grandma so quickly, but on the other hand,  I understand that you're the father, all right, I'll tighten my seatbelt, and I'll be quiet. And yet, fortunately, the Bible gives us more than that, doesn't treat us as babies. It gives us some wonderful stories. Let me give you an example.

All things work together according to the Council of his will, or Romans 8.28, all things  work together for good to those who love God. One essential story of this is the story of Jacob and Joseph. Jacob was a patriarch. Jacob was a man who had 12 sons, and he did the stupidest thing that a father can do. He set his heart on one of his 12 sons, Joseph.

He doted on that little boy. He doted on that young man, and he was clearly in love with the kid, and he was clearly  the favorite, and there's nothing that can inject pain into a family worse than that. And it did. As Joseph grew up, because he was indulged, and because he was centered on, he was becoming  an arrogant kid, he was becoming a superficial and empty person, he was becoming the kind  of superficial and empty person that always comes out of such an indulgent environment. Meanwhile, the other brothers were turning into alienated and resentful kids, and alienated  resentful young men, and finally their resentment grew to the place where they became capable  of a horrible thing.

The kidnap Joseph, they put him into a pit, and they sold him into slavery, and they  told his father he was dead, that an animal had killed him. And his father, because Joseph was his god, Joseph was his idol, his father lost all hope,  and went into depression for years. The sons who had done this, the brothers who had done this, lived with a guilt, and over  the years it became unbearable, and they became alienated from each other, and their father  and their life was miserable. But Joseph did not die, he was sold into slavery, and in the hardship of slavery, and in the  hard knocks of Egypt he got what his father never could have given him, Jacob never could have  given it to him, character, grit, savvy, wit, and he learned to cling to God. And eventually this brought out the potential in Joseph, he never would have happened  if he stayed at home, it brought out the potential, and eventually he came to the place where  he rose up to become prime minister of Egypt.

And with his foresight he realized that a famine was coming and he created a grain reserve  program, so that when the famine hit, instead of everybody starving to death, he was in charge  of giving out the grain from the years of plenty, so that the people during the years of famine  weren't starving. While the famine stretched all the way up to the place where Jacob and the 11 remaining  brothers lived, and Jacob sent ten of the brothers down to Egypt to get grain and to get  food so they wouldn't starve. And when they see Joseph, Joseph recognizes them, but Joseph is hidden to them, they don't  recognize him. Joseph can't believe it when he sees his brothers. He wants to have revenge, but he wants to test them.

So he says, who are you? They explain. We're from a far country where twelve brothers, one of them is dead, one is at home with  our father, who's elderly. Your spy, as he says. You're here to spy us out and give information to invading countries.

No, no, no, not a bit. Not at all, they say. That's not true. We're really brothers. Okay, I'll tell you what I'll do, says the prime minister.

I'm going to keep one of your brothers, I'm going to keep Simeon, I'm going to put him  in jail here. I'm going to send you home with just a little food, but if you want more food, if you want  to not starve, you've got to prove that you are really a family, bring that youngest  son Benjamin back, that you tell me about, bring him here, then I'll know you're telling  the truth, but if you don't come back with Benjamin, you'll never see my face again. You'll never get grain here, you'll all starve. So sadly, they go back to Jacob and they say, father, we've got a little bit of food,  but if we're going to go back again, we've got to take Benjamin. And at that point, Jacob, you see, cries out.

And in Genesis chapter 42, verse 36, he cries a cry that I believe is the quintessential  cry of a person looking at life without seeing it through the kingship of Christ. He says, I say, we've got to take Benjamin back, we've got to go back. And he says, no, Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more. And now you would take Benjamin from me, everything is against me. Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more.

And now you would take Benjamin from me, everything is against me. And at the moment, he said that God was moving heaven and earth for Jacob. If Jacob hadn't lost Joseph, Joseph and the whole family would have been destroyed. If Jacob hadn't lost Joseph, the whole region would be dying of starvation. Through the incident of the loss of Joseph, God was healing Joseph.

He was humbling his brothers. He was helping the whole region economically. And he was destroying the idols that were ruining and distorting Jacob's life. God was moving everything, moving heaven and earth for Jacob. But is that what Jacob thought?

No, what did he say? Everything is against me. Joseph is no more. But Joseph was just being hidden from him, he was in preparation. Simeon is no more.

Simeon was really fine, he was in preparation. Everything is against me. That's how your life will always look, if you refuse to believe that God knows more than you. If you refuse to believe he's king, if you refuse to believe he's good,  then how about you? How do you feel when you look at your life right now?

Do you feel that way? What's the cry of your heart? You say, I'm never going to find love now. I'm never going to find success now. These things are no more.

And everything is against me. Is that how you feel? What's understandable? I mean, look at Jacob, that's how he felt, that's how he saw things. He was a patriarch, he was no idiot.

He wasn't stupid and neither are you to feel that way. But you're wrong. You're wrong. Be careful. Look in the mirror of that cry.

Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more. You're going to take Benjamin from me, everything is against me. Look in that cry, there's a mirror there. And so I don't want to be like that. I don't want to say that.

Friends, if you understand that God's plan includes bad things, that God's plan includes  your choices, that God's plan includes little things, and that all of God's plan is controlling  every single event to the end and to the goal of making Jesus Christ all in all and king  of all healing the universe, then you understand the doctrine of providence. And if you understand it and you begin to operate on this, on that wavelength, you begin  to remind yourself of these things all the time. What will that do to you? Well, I'll just close by saying it'll have three effects. One is it'll make you feisty, feisty.

You see, if you believe that God hates the evil as much as you do, and that though it's  in store, you're going to get hurt, you're going to be hurt, you're going to find all  sorts of bad things happening to you and around you. But you know that you can lose a battle, but you can't lose a war. See, the pagan notion of evil is that's it, except it. And the modern notion of evil is it's random, let's fight against it. But Christians understand that we fight with hope.

There's a feistiness, you know, the latest, the last twilight Paris album has it's, I  think it's the first song on the first side, a song God is in control, oh, it's not the  greatest work of art, but the feistiness is in the lyrics. And the chorus goes, God is in control. We believe that his children will not be forsaken. God is in control. We choose to believe, we choose to remember and never be shaken.

We choose to remember and never be shaken. There is no power above or beside him. We know God is in control. There's a feistiness, you know, in your face evil. We choose to remember and never be shaken.

It's your choice. There's a feistiness, secondly, there's also a kind of contentment because even when things  go bad, you know what God's doing to you. There's this great little book for children called the Velveteen Rabbit and in one place  in the Velveteen Rabbit, these two animals, stuffed animals, two toys in the nursery are  talking to each other. And the one toy says to the other toy, what does it mean to get real? Well, it says the skin horse.

It's a thing that happens to you when a child loves you for a long, long, long time. Not just to play with, but really loves you, you become real. It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges or who  have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you're real, most of your hair has been loved off and your eyes  have dropped out and you get all loose in the joints and you're very shabby, but these  things don't matter at all because once you're real, you can't be ugly except to people  who don't understand.

You see, if you understand the doctrine of Christ's kingship, you know that everything that's  happening to you is God's way of making you real, even if your hair is loved off or your  eyes are fallen out of you, feeling kind of shabby and you know the stuffing is coming  out the back. But you see, there's a contentment because you know that this is part of his plan that  includes everything. But lastly, and this is something of a warning, the doctrine of God's providence humbles us. Because you know the promise is all things work together for good to those who love God. Now, do you know what that means?

All things work together for good to those who love God. What does that mean? It means this. Very important. Last thing I'm going to say, very critical, hope you wake up now, okay?

If everything that happens happens to the goal to make Christ king, right? Everything that's happening is happening to that end. That means that if you have made Christ king of your life, if you've made him save your  and king, if that's the thing you're living for, if that's the preeminent desire of your  life, then everything that happens in the world, every grain of sand, every atom, every  molecule, every event is for you. All things work together for good to those who love God. But if on the other hand, you're living as your own king, if you rejected the kingship  of Christ, you might be religious, but you're your own master, you decide and you call the  shots.

If you're working against his kingship, that means that every event in the universe is  against you and there's no in between. Either every molecule in the universe is for you or every molecule in the universe is against  you. You can see it. Do you make Jesus king? Then what?

No matter good or bad things that happen to you, it's moving him more toward him, toward  it. You know, when good things happen, you're closer to God because you're so grateful. When bad things happen, you're closer to God. Why? Because it shows you how much you need him.

But now let's take a look at a person who's rejected the kingship of Christ. Good and bad things, the good things just make this person feel that I don't need God. And the bad things make the person feel I can't trust him. So whether a good or bad happens to a person who is not submitted to the kingship of Christ,  everything that happens, everything good or bad or indifferent is hardening you, pushing  you away, moving you away. You can have a universe in which every atom is for you and every atom is against you,  but there's nothing in the middle.

## Chinese Transcript / 中文

在今天的教导中,提姆·凯勒影响了耶稣如何主动寻找我们,向我们启示真理,并呼召我们归向祂。整个月我们一直在思考耶稣是谁的各个方面,今天我们要来看说"耶稣为王"意味着什么。顺便提一句,关于这个主题——我的意思是,我已经讲过一次这篇讲道了,我想在讲这篇道的过程中,可能会惊出几条蛇,但实际杀掉的却更少。所以今天可能是个好日子,像我们通常在4点聚会后所做的那样,跟我下楼到东厅,在礼拜结束后、在后奏之后,我们会有问答环节。所以我肯定会惊出一两条蛇,至少以你的标准来看,我在讲道过程中并没有真正钉住它们,所以记下你的问题,思考一下,然后下来,我们随后会进行问答。

现在,以弗所书第1章,我们读到:"神按着自己的美意,使我们知道他旨意的奥秘;为要照所安排的,在日期满足的时候,使天上地上一切所有的,都在基督里面同归于一。我们也在他里面得了基业,这原是那位随己意行做万事的,照着他旨意所预定的,叫他的荣耀,从我们这首先在基督里有盼望的人,可以得着称赞。"这是神的话语。

如果你把一个从南美雨林中心的人带出来,他从未去过其他任何地方,把他放在时代广场中心,对他来说这看起来会是混乱和疯狂的。他会想知道为什么人们通过这些楼梯冲进地球的腹部。

他会想知道为什么这些看起来像金属的奇怪动物在路上飞驰,为什么人们招呼那些黄色的,然后让它们当场把自己吞掉。这个人会有各种各样的问题。这看起来会是混乱和疯狂的,因为他看不到其中的目的。这个世界对他来说会充满毫无意义的元素。现在如果你在纽约住了一段时间,时代广场看起来就不会那么毫无意义,虽然仍然有点毫无意义。

但我想向你们提出,这个画面是一个很好的例证,说明许多人随着时间的推移越来越多地看待他们生活的方式。你年龄越大,就越会看到生活似乎并不遵循规则。当你刚开始的时候,当你年轻的时候,当你在上大学的时候,有些事情你确信永远不会发生在你身上,或者有些事情你永远不会做。你看,有规则。你的朋友中没有人会做这个。

随着时间的流逝,你开始怀疑是否有什么规则。好人最后一名,好人早死,诸如此类。它们会发生。确实会发生。在实践层面上,人们随着年龄增长,开始怀疑是否有任何韵律或理由;从智识上来说,这当然是真的,在知识界越来越如此。

有更多的思想家在说,宇宙实际上在其根本上就有随机性,旧的科学宇宙观,那种机械论的观点,认为有所有这些必须始终如一地遵循的定律,而像斯蒂芬·霍金和许多其他人在许多其他领域的人都在说,没有任何韵律或理由。生命是混乱的,历史是混乱的。除了无序,什么都不是。这既是今天实践上的,也是智识上的感知。

然而,我要说,基督教对这种感知有最奇妙、最精深、最决定性的答案。这个答案其实就在我们刚刚读过的经文里。耶稣是王。换句话说,如果你走到那个可怜的南美雨林来的人面前,他正在时代广场四处游荡,快要崩溃了,你会让他停下来,让他坐下,你会说:"冷静下来。我可以解释。"

你可能无法很快解释清楚。他要理解地铁是什么,你看,电是什么,可能需要很长的路要走,但你可以说:"冷静下来。有一个解释。"嗯,圣经来了,它对我们说,当我们看到我们的生活和历史看起来混乱时,它说:"冷静下来。

有一个解释。"虽然它不是,同样地,正如圣经所说,我不能一夜之间向你解释一切,但这一切的关键就是基督的王权。让我向你展示这如何回答这种感知,这如何成为对历史表面混乱最精深、最奇妙、最决定性的答案。

首先,圣经说,基督的王权有两个方面,这两个方面必须在你心中被理解和保持为有区别但不分离的。有区别但不分离。

如果你不理解这个王权的两个方面,如果你不理解它们不是相同的,但它们是共存的,如果你不理解它们两者,并看到它们有区别但不分离,你的生活和历史就会像时代广场对那个可怜人一样。让我解释一下这两者是什么。它们就在这段经文里。第一个在前半部分。它说:"他旨意的奥秘,他的美意,使天上地上一切所有的,都在基督里面同归于一。"

这是在谈论即将来临的国度。耶稣基督有一个即将到来的国度。他的国度有一个未来的方面。我仍然认为,也许解释这一点最好的方式就是用这个比喻。神发明宇宙,就像钟表匠发明时钟一样,只不过神把自己放进了时钟里。

神在起初创造宇宙,有点像钟表匠制造时钟,但神把自己放进了时钟里。而我们人类,可以说,是关键的齿轮。如果你能打开时钟的后盖。如果宇宙是一个时钟,你能打开后盖,按照它最初的设计方式,人类就在中心,上面与神啮合,下面与自然啮合。我们是世界的副摄政,是自然界中神的副摄政,但当我们决定把副摄政中的"副"去掉,当我们决定要成为我们自己的摄政,我们想成为我们自己的王,我们想成为我们自己的主人时。

那就像一个齿轮脱落了,从它的轴上掉进了下面所有的轮子里。当我们决定成为自己的指挥者、成为自己的摄政时,宇宙发生了什么,正好就是如果那种情况发生在时钟上会发生的事情,那就是宇宙开始冒烟、研磨、破裂和碎裂。线圈、弹簧和杠杆向各个方向飞出,你看。换句话说,宇宙开始分解。我想每个科学家、每个物理学家,也许甚至每个心理学家——我希望,当然每个圣经神学家都会说,生命的本质和宇宙在其所有方面——物理上、社会上、精神上、文化上——的本质就是恶化。

一切都在衰败,一切都在分崩离析的过程中,一切都在分解,一切都在解体,因为那个齿轮已经从轴上掉到了时钟的底部,一切都在呻吟,一切都在碎裂,事情运作不正常了。于是疾病和衰败进来了,不公正和压迫进来了,恐惧和内疚进来了,这一切都是因为我们没有与上面的王啮合。现在,圣经告诉我们,只要看看历史,神允许这场悲剧自行展开。我们是自由的道德行动者。他让它发生了。

他让我们承受后果,但他承诺不会让我们永远在自己的苦果中挣扎。他承诺不会让我们永远死去。他承诺有一天他会回来,重新建立他的国度,他会把人类重新放回轴上,他会再次从上面与我们啮合。当那事发生时,一切都会被医治——物理上、社会上、精神上,在各个方面。一切都会再次合一。

这就是保罗在这里谈论的,因为你看,他说,这是伟大的计划。这是他旨意的奥秘,按照他的美意。在日期满足的时候就会实现。这是神的终极目的。这是历史的意义,对吧?

使天上地上一切所有的,都在基督里面同归于一。这意味着一切都是分离的。一切都在分解。但它将被合在一起。它将变得完整。

我们的身体,不再像衰老时那样分崩离析,我们将被医治完整。我们的灵魂,不再破碎,将被医治完整。我们的关系,一切都在一位元首之下联合。这个"元首"的概念,意味着基督是王。是世界的元首,那是未来的一个时刻。

当一切都达到圆满时,一切都将联合。一切都将被医治。他将成为元首。宇宙,从某种意义上说,再次成为他的身体。身体是什么呢?

它是一个整合的、相互关联的有机系统的整体,你看,而不是像现在的宇宙那样,只是一堆互相争斗的轮子和滑轮。这是神的终极目的。当时候满足时,耶稣基督将成为万有的王。一切的抵抗都将被平息。他将把我们放回轴上,他将再次从上面与我们啮合。

当那事发生时,我们真的不知道会是什么样子。但每天花几分钟默想那会是什么样子,通常是值得的。我们所知道的只是充满矛盾的、宏伟的隐喻。我们知道,当他成为万有的元首和王时,死亡将会死去。衰败将最终衰败。

这种联合将分离。疾病将得绝症。结局将被终结。暴力将被施暴。破坏将被摧毁。

诸如此类。"眼睛未曾看见,耳朵未曾听见,人心也未曾想到,神为爱他的人所预备的。"我就喜欢那个地方,卢克·天行者对汉·索罗说:"我们需要去救公主,你知道为什么吗?因为她很有钱。真的有多有钱?他说,比你能想象的还要多。"

汉·索罗转过身说:"我能想象很多。"我们能想象很多。所以想象一下,当有一天,当神说你无法想象时,那会是什么——眼睛未曾看见,耳朵未曾听见,人心也未曾想到。你不知道。你能想象很多喜乐,不是吗?

不,你不能。与之相比什么都不是。在他成为万有元首的那一天,那就是将要发生的事。现在,但那只是他王权的一个方面。他将要取得他的王权。

他将有一个未来的、完全的王权,但接着这里提到了他王权的第二个方面。我们已经提到了它,那就是他现在就是历史的王。他可能还没有在世界上平息所有对他的抵抗。他可能还没有在人类中平息所有对他的抵抗。但历史对他没有抵抗。

他完全掌管着历史的每一个事件。你看,历史的整个要点就是说,当时候满足时,使万有在基督里同归于一,他说:"我们在他里面得了基业,这原是那位随己意行做万事的,照着他旨意所预定的。"老钦定本过去常说:"他使万事都一同效力,照着他旨意的筹算。"

现在你看,基督王权的这两个方面必须结合在一起,否则你就无法理解你的生命。保罗在以弗所书1章末尾把它们结合在一起,他说,我引用:"又将万有服在他的脚下,使他为教会作万有之首;教会是他的身体,是那充满万有者所充满的。"

这是在说什么呢?它是在说,虽然你还没有看到耶稣基督被加冕为万有之王,你还没有看到他平息了对他王权的一切抵抗。因此你看到破碎,你看到身体的不完美,你到处看到痛苦、看到苦难,但现在历史正被王掌舵。你可以说耶稣基督坐在历史的驾驶座上。他正把它导向那个欧米伽点,那实际上就是阿尔法点,在那个地方他充满万有。

所以现在发生的每一件事,每一件事,我们稍后会讲到,每一个事件,都在他的掌控之下,都是这段经文在希腊文中所说的他的计划、他的目的、他的筹算的一部分,这是他的计划,他有一个蓝图,他现在正在实现他对历史的主权,以便那时他能够实现他对宇宙的完全主权和完全医治。

现在,除非你把这两件事结合在一起,生命看起来就会疯狂。所以例如,有人说:"等一下,如果神——如果耶稣基督是万有之王,发生的每一件事都是按照他的计划发生的,那意味着他计划了那场地震,屋顶塌陷,所有那些可怜的人在睡梦中死去。如果神是王,如果耶稣是王,为什么会有苦难?"

现在你看,这个问题忘记了这个答案是多么精深,耶稣的王权不是只有一个方面,而是有两个。

他现在有一个计划,要把我们带到一个不再有地震的地方。他有一个历史的计划,要把我们带到一个不再有杀戮、不再有谋杀、不再有死亡、不再有任何东西的地方。然而他正在带我们去那里,因为在我们到达那一点之前必须发生许多事情。什么事呢?现在,如果我们生活在2500年前,有一件事我们完全不知道,那就是十字架的受难。

我们不会理解它。我们不会知道耶稣基督要同样死去。如果他没有死,没有为那些相信的人偿付罪债,会发生什么呢,当然,神就不能以适当的方式对待我们。我们当时不知道这一点。现在我们知道了。

但在那条路上还有许多其他事情。换句话说,神正在带我们去一个没有痛苦的地方。但通往没有痛苦的地方的路要经过痛苦。通往冠冕的路要经过十字架。对耶稣来说是这样,对我们来说也是这样。

在某种程度上,我们知道这一点。我们许多人,特别是随着年龄增长,意识到只有最肤浅的人——没有烦恼的生活造就肤浅。没有失败的生活造就肤浅。我的意思是,直觉上,你意识到如果不是因为我们的烦恼,我们对自己就不会知道多少。在许多情况下,如果不是因为我们的烦恼,我们就不会认识神。有各种各样的暗示。我们不是完全理解。

但我们被告知,他的王权有两个方面。他正在把我们导向一个不再有地震的地方。然而在通往那里的路上,他带我们经过地震。他正在把我们导向一个不再有十字架的地方,在那里只有冠冕,但在途中,他自己必须经过十字架。

我最近读了英国作家约翰·斯托得的一本书,约翰·斯托得这样说。他说,我是基督徒的主要原因之一就是这个。他说,世界充满了如此多的苦难和痛苦。世界充满了如此多的邪恶和破碎,以至于我无法相信一位自己从未受过苦的神。我无法相信一位没有受苦、没有上十字架的神。

他说,我是基督徒的原因之一是没有其他宗教提供给你一位受过苦的神。你看,神憎恨地震。我们被告知。然而它被编织进他的计划。为什么有人说:"听着,如果他真的是王,为什么他要花时间?你在告诉我什么?为什么必须花时间?"

我不完全知道。但我知道,但那个问题对神来说听起来可能像这样。如果你——大多数父亲都有过这种经历,你有一个三四岁的小孩,你说我们要去看奶奶和爷爷。让我们上车。我可以说:"耶!"他们上车,你在路上,五分钟后,孩子说:"爸爸,我们到了吗?"

你说:"不,我们还没到。"为什么没到?我累了。我想到那里。你告诉我你要带我去那里。为什么要这么长时间?

现在,你说:"好吧,宝贝,到奶奶和爷爷家有350英里。我们才走了五分钟。还需要很长时间。"孩子说:"为什么不开快一点?"你看,你知道,你是全能的,父亲。你可以开快一点。所以你试图向一个四岁的孩子解释一些基本物理定律。

他不想听。他说:"你就是刻薄。"到某个时候,你对孩子说什么?你说:"宝贝,你才四岁,你不懂物理,对不起。但我能告诉你的就是系好安全带,安静点。"你看,你知道,有非常多非常有学问的论述,反对神的存在,基础就是如果他真的是王,如果他真的要带我们去一个所有地震都消失的地方,为什么我们还没到那里?

非常有学问,非常精彩。你看,非常非常详细。然而基本上,它归结为:"爸爸,我们到了吗?为什么没到?你为什么不能开快一点?"

因为我无法理解某件事——对神的心智来说可能就像基本物理对我们的心智一样简单。因为我无法理解那个,所以也许根本就没有神。这是正常的反应,但你不明白吗?如果耶稣基督是王,那么不是所有事情都有意义就是有意义的。

如果我们与他的关系,甚至像我四岁的儿子与我的关系一样,那么不是所有事情都有意义就是有意义的,如果它有意义,它就会有意义。你看,这是如此合理的奥秘,这个伟大的教义,说他在掌管,我们不理解一切。但他说:"我正在带你去那个地方,在那里耶稣将充满万有,万有都将联合。与此同时,发生的每一件事,所有事情的发生都是为了把你带到那个地方。"发生的每一件事,一切都被设计来把我们带到耶稣基督为万有之王的地方。

现在这意味着什么?让我们实际地分析一下。我们刚才向你展示了为什么神掌控历史。他正试图把我们带到耶稣为万有之王的地方。但他如何掌控历史?

如果你看看这段经文,我们这里印刷的版本说:"他随己意行做万事,照着他旨意所预定的。"我想和你们默想一分钟,向你们展示这个教义在历史上如何被称为神的护理教义。神的护理教义,护理这个词来自供应,意思是发生的每一件事都是神的供应。这个教义是独特的。它不同于人文主义,不同于世俗主义,不同于伊斯兰教,不同于佛教和东方宗教,它是独特的。这一切都与这个词——"万事"——联系在一起。

我告诉你,如果你理解这个词"万事",它会改变你的生命,它会改变你的态度,它会改变你明天处理生活的方式。如果你理解他如何通过护理行使他的王权,如果你理解万事都一同效力,照着他旨意的筹算,他旨意的目的,它将改变你的生活方式。让我向你展示。

首先,"万事"这个词是什么意思?它意味着三件事。第一,万事意味着神的计划包括小事。神的计划包括小事,必须如此。我们大多数人不这样想,万事。箴言16章说:"签放在怀里,定事由耶和华。"这意味着即使当你抛硬币,如果它正面朝上或反面朝上,这都是他计划的一部分。他的计划中没有遗漏任何东西。

你可能知道浪子的故事,但它不仅仅是关于一个任性的小弟弟。事实上,耶稣讲这个故事既是对那些逃离神的人说的,也是对那些试图通过行善来赢得他的爱的人说的。在他的书《浪子的神》中,提姆·凯勒展示了这个众所周知的故事如何揭示福音的核心,这是给叛逆的小弟弟和论断的大哥哥的盼望信息,也是邀请所有人体验神浪子般的、丰盛的恩典。无论你是基督徒还是仍在探索信仰,《浪子的神》都会帮助你以全新的方式看待与基督的关系。

《浪子的神》是我们感谢你本月奉献的礼物,帮助"福音与生命"与全世界的人分享基督恩慈和不懈的爱所带来的盼望和喜乐。

今天就在 gospelandlife.com/give 索取你的副本,就是 gospelandlife.com/give。

好的,这是我想强调的第一件事,让我再推进一点。人们说:"来吧,没有什么。你是在告诉我提姆·凯勒今天戴的领带从永恒开始就是神计划的一部分吗?你是在试图告诉我,我今天决定穿的鞋子是神计划的一部分吗?"

像那样的小事,嗯,它们只对你我来说是小事,因为我们如此不智。没有小事。现在,1912年有人试图枪杀西奥多·罗斯福,他们确实在胸部射中了他。你知道他为什么活下来吗?因为他碰巧把眼镜盒放在这一边而不是那一边。

你的婚姻,在许多情况下,你的职业,你上什么学校,往往都是基于所谓的小事。我可以给你一个快速的例子。我今天早上没有讲,但我妻子告诉我,即使你以前听过这个故事,我也必须在4点的聚会上讲,因为这是完美的例子。我成为长老会牧师的唯一原因,是因为我神学院最后一个学期来了一位特定的教员,他把我推过了边缘。

当涉及到我的神学理解时,我决定:"是的,我想我需要成为长老会成员。"这就是我今天在这里的原因。他为什么来?他来那一年的唯一原因是因为他正在尝试——他是英国人,在获得护照来我在马萨诸塞州的神学院教书时遇到了很多麻烦,但有人为他从很高的层面牵线。

他记得有一天,每天他都会去美国大使馆,排很长的队,他说:"我永远拿不到护照,我永远不能——"但你知道,当时的一个问题是他必须证明没有美国公民能像他一样胜任这份工作才能得到这份工作,这是一个非常漫长的过程。有一天,当他在排这条长队时,有人出来找他,叫他的名字,有人出来说:"一周内你就能成为美国人。

我们从很高层得到消息。"好吧,你知道那是谁。那是一个叫迈克·福特的人。迈克·福特是当时总统的儿子,是杰拉尔德·福特的儿子,他是戈登康威尔神学院的学生,我也在那里,他找到了一种方法把这位特定的教员弄到戈登康威尔,因为他的父亲是总统。

你知道他父亲为什么是总统吗?因为水门事件。你知道,因为水门丑闻,尼克松辞职了,杰拉尔德·福特成为了总统。迈克·福特有影响力把这个人弄过去的原因,这就是他在那里的原因。这就是我成为长老会成员的原因。

这就是我现在在和你们说话的原因。那么尼克松为什么倒台?因为某个愚蠢的水门窃贼一天晚上把门敞开了,某个警卫注意到门是开着的。现在,如果那个警卫那天没有经过呢?也许他那天经过是因为那天早上他没吃早餐,他到得早了一点。

你看,如果那个警卫没有看到那扇门敞开着,我就不会在这里。你生命中的每一件事都是这样的。雷·布拉德伯里已经弄明白了。雷·布拉德伯里有一个关于未来、关于时间旅行的伟大故事。

他有一个故事是关于当人们回到过去时,他们必须非常小心地走在磁场上,不要碰任何东西。否则一切都会改变,其中一个故事中,一个时间旅行者不小心滑倒了,从磁场上摔下来,踩到了一只蝴蝶。那杀死了它,一切都改变了,宇宙的其余部分,历史的其余部分永远改变了。

一切都是相互关联的。当人们说:"你是说神计划了一切"时,这是愚蠢的。如果你想想,你会意识到没有其他方式,你能想象一个有思想的人每天从床上起来时的恐惧吗,知道有这样一种东西叫做机会?任何事情都可能发生。知道最微小的事情都可能完全改变你生活的一切,完全改变文明。

神的计划包括一切,你的安全就在于此。好的,第二,万事这个词意味着神的计划也包括我们的选择。这是人们有困难的事情,对吧?我刚才提出的第一点是神的计划包括小事。每一件小事,一切都是他计划的一部分。它说万事都照着他的计划运作。

好吧,你的第一反应是:"那太可怕了。那意味着我们都注定要做某些事情,我们没有自由,没有自由。"那不是真的。事实上,那不是真的,因为这个词——万事。我在这里的第二点是神的计划包括我们的选择。

宿命论。听着,希腊人教导宿命论,罗马人教导宿命论,穆斯林教导某种宿命论,一种命运。但宿命论不包括我们的选择,在宿命论的思想体系中。一切都是固定的,除了我们的选择。让我给你一个例子。

在所有希腊神话中,如果一个预言来了,说这个女人或这个男人注定是个罪犯。如果那个可怜的人花费数年试图行善,试图过好的生活,试图避免犯罪的生活,那都不重要,为什么。因为你看,在希腊世界观中,在宿命论世界观中,如果你注定是个罪犯,无论你做什么都不重要。尽管你的选择,你是注定的。无论你多么努力地试图行善,你都是注定的,你注定要成为罪犯。

这就是宿命论的运作方式。换句话说,一切都是固定的,除了你的选择。你可以用你的选择做任何事,但那不重要。但基督教是不同的,基督教说一切都是神计划的一部分,包括你的选择。计划是通过你的选择固定的,包括你的选择,而不是尽管你的选择,这意味着一些非常简单但又非常深刻、非常神秘但又非常合理的东西。

它只是意味着你的选择总是计划的一部分。这是雅各。雅各对他父亲犯罪,他抢劫了他的兄弟。结果,他不得不离开,在异乡生活,他过着非常悲惨的生活。然而,他在那个异乡遇到了他一生的挚爱拉结。

他们生了孩子,弥赛亚耶稣基督就是通过他们的后裔降生的。所以很明显,雅各必须犯罪,必须去那个异乡,耶稣才能降生。耶稣显然是神计划的,对吧?是的。所以那个罪是计划好的,对吧?是的,当然。

然而那个罪是自由的。那个罪是负责任的。没有人强迫他,然而它是计划的一部分。进入他生命中的不良后果是因为计划而发生的。也因为选择,这一切都一起运作。

雅各完全自由,完全负责,然而发生在他身上的每一件事都是计划的一部分。同时。神在掌控。我们是自由的。为什么?

因为万事都是计划的一部分。神从不尽管我们的选择而固定我们的命运。你知道,查尔斯·司布真有那个伟大的故事,过去常讲。他去看他的一个生病的朋友,司布真相信所有这些。他是浸信会传道人。

他去看一个生病的朋友,他说:"你怎么样?"朋友说:"哦,我不知道我是否应该吃药。"司布真说:"为什么?"他说:"嗯,他说,我不知道神是否注定我活下来还是死去。"司布真说:"你知道,现在司布真本可以讲课说,好吧,在希腊的命运观念中,如果你要死,无论你做什么都不重要。

在基督教观点中不是这样。哦,不,你的选择总是与计划相连。所以他说了什么?他说:"我亲爱的朋友,我可以准确地告诉你会发生什么。如果你吃药,你注定要活。

如果你不吃药,你注定要死。"因为万事,万事,都是他计划的一部分。这完全说得通,尽管你不能总是,你知道,完全理解这件事。使徒行传中有一个伟大的地方,使徒行传27章,保罗在船上。那条船正处于可怕的暴风雨中。

保罗站起来说:"神已经向我显明,这船上没有人会失去生命,但我们会失去船。我们将遭遇海难,但没有人会失去生命。神已经说话了。"好的,这是一个预言。好的。

然而,在某个时刻,士兵们试图上救生艇。保罗跑过去说:"如果你们上救生艇,我们都会死。不要上救生艇。"这是在他刚说完"神说没有人会丧生"之后三节经文的地方。所以他们做了什么?

他们说:"好吧,保罗说不要这么做,否则我们会被杀。"然而,当然,没有人丧生。为什么?因为你看,神从不尽管我们的选择而固定我们的命运,而是通过我们的选择。因为与宿命论不同,万事都是他计划的一部分。

朋友们,这意味着当你做一个选择时,当你面前有一个选择时,要做好它。不要耸耸肩说它不重要。因为如果你做出好的选择,你会处于良好状态。如果你做出坏的选择,各种可怕的后果都会发生。然而,知道了这一点,另一方面,这个伟大教义的美妙之处在于,然而,你必须意识到你不能把你的生活搞砸,超过神为你预备的。

他说,他对你的旨意是他爱你。你不能做某事,然后挫败神,你看?神从不俯视你说:"哦我的天,她为什么要那样做?现在我该怎么办?我想我可以让她嫁给这个人,但我不知道。"

你知道,神不是那样运作的。你做出坏的选择,你已经做出了坏的选择。你做出坏的选择。你做一些愚蠢的事,你做一些鲁莽的事,你做一些邪恶的事。会有后果,然而,然而,万事都是这个计划的一部分。

你不能搞砸你的生活。他在其中工作,但最后,他的计划包括万事,因此,小事。他的计划包括万事,因此,选择。但神的计划包括万事。他的掌控,他对历史的王权,包括万事,包括坏事。

我知道这是最难的一个,但让我告诉你一个故事来解释。神憎恨坏事,然而,他把坏事包括在内。他把它们编织进他的计划。为什么,有人说?嗯,我们已经讲过一次,告诉你部分地,这是一个奥秘。

部分地,这是一个地方,你必须说:"我是个孩子,你是父亲,好吗?我不明白为什么我们不能这么快到奶奶那里,但另一方面,我明白你是父亲,好吧,我会系紧安全带,我会安静。"然而,幸运的是,圣经给了我们的不止这些,不是把我们当婴儿对待。它给了我们一些美妙的故事。让我给你一个例子。

万事都照着他旨意的筹算一同效力,或罗马书8:28,"万事都互相效力,叫爱神的人得益处。"这个基本故事就是雅各和约瑟的故事。雅各是一位族长。雅各有12个儿子,他做了一个父亲能做的最愚蠢的事。他把心放在12个儿子中的一个身上,约瑟。

他溺爱那个小男孩。他溺爱那个年轻人,他明显爱这个孩子,他明显是最喜欢的,没有什么比这更能给家庭注入痛苦的了。确实如此。随着约瑟长大,因为他被纵容,因为他是被关注的中心,他变成了一个傲慢的孩子,他变成了一个肤浅空洞的人,他变成了总是从这种纵容环境中出来的那种肤浅空洞的人。

与此同时,其他兄弟们变成了疏远和怨恨的孩子,疏远怨恨的年轻人,最终他们的怨恨增长到这样的程度,以至于他们能够做出可怕的事情。他们绑架约瑟,把他放进坑里,把他卖为奴隶,他们告诉他父亲他死了,说动物杀了他。

他的父亲,因为约瑟是他的神,约瑟是他的偶像,他的父亲失去了所有希望,陷入抑郁好几年。做了这事的儿子们,做了这事的兄弟们,带着内疚生活,多年来这变得难以承受,他们彼此疏远,与他们的父亲疏远,他们的生活很悲惨。

但约瑟没有死,他被卖为奴隶,在奴隶制的艰苦中,在埃及的艰难打击中,他得到了他父亲永远无法给他的东西,雅各永远无法给他的东西:品格、勇气、精明、机智,他学会了紧紧抓住神。

最终这带出了约瑟的潜力,如果他留在家里这永远不会发生,它带出了潜力,最终他来到这样的地步,他升到成为埃及的宰相。

凭借他的远见,他意识到饥荒即将来临,他创建了一个粮食储备计划,以便当饥荒来袭时,代替每个人饿死,他负责从丰年发放粮食,这样在饥荒的年月里人们不会挨饿。

饥荒一直延伸到雅各和剩余的11个兄弟居住的地方,雅各派十个兄弟下到埃及去取粮食和食物,这样他们就不会饿死。当他们见到约瑟时,约瑟认出了他们,但约瑟对他们是隐藏的,他们认不出他。

约瑟看到他的兄弟们时简直不敢相信。他想报复,但他想试探他们。所以他说:"你们是谁?"他们解释说:"我们来自一个遥远的国家,我们是十二个兄弟,其中一个死了,一个和我们年迈的父亲在家。"

"你们是间谍,"他说。"你们在这里刺探,给入侵国家提供情报。""不,不,不,一点都不是,"他们说。"那根本不是真的。我们真的是兄弟。""好吧,我告诉你我要做什么,"宰相说。

"我要留下你们的一个兄弟,我要把西缅关在监狱里。我要送你们回家,只带一点食物,但如果你们想要更多食物,如果你们不想饿死,你们必须证明你们真的是一家人,把你们告诉我的那个最小的儿子便雅悯带回来,带他来这里,然后我就知道你们说的是真话,但如果你们不带便雅悯回来,你们永远不会再见到我的面。你们永远不会在这里得到粮食,你们都会饿死。"

所以悲伤地,他们回到雅各那里,他们说:"父亲,我们有一点食物,但如果我们要再回去,我们必须带便雅悯。"在那时,雅各,你看,大声喊叫。

在创世记42章36节,他发出了我相信是一个没有通过基督的王权看待生活的人的典型呼喊。他说:"我说,我们必须把便雅悯带回去,我们必须回去。"他说:"不,约瑟没有了,西缅也没有了。

现在你们要带走便雅悯,一切都与我作对。"约瑟没有了,西缅也没有了。现在你们要带走便雅悯,一切都与我作对。

在他说那话的那一刻,神正在为雅各调动天地。如果雅各没有失去约瑟,约瑟和整个家庭都会被毁灭。如果雅各没有失去约瑟,整个地区都会饿死。

通过失去约瑟这件事,神正在医治约瑟。他在使他的兄弟们谦卑。他在经济上帮助整个地区。他在摧毁正在毁坏和扭曲雅各生命的偶像。

神正在移动一切,为雅各调动天地。但雅各是那么想的吗?不,他说了什么?"一切都与我作对。约瑟没有了。"但约瑟只是对他隐藏了,他在被预备中。"西缅没有了。"

西缅其实很好,他在被预备中。"一切都与我作对。"如果你拒绝相信神知道的比你多,你的生活看起来总是这样。如果你拒绝相信他是王,如果你拒绝相信他是良善的,那你呢?

你现在看你的生活时感觉如何?你有那种感觉吗?你内心的呼喊是什么?你说:"我现在永远找不到爱了。我现在永远找不到成功了。这些东西没有了。

一切都与我作对。"这就是你的感受吗?这是可以理解的。我的意思是,看看雅各,这就是他的感受,这就是他看事情的方式。他是一个族长,他不是白痴。

他不愚蠢,你有那种感觉也不愚蠢。但你错了。你错了。小心。照照那个呼喊的镜子。

"约瑟没有了,西缅没有了。你们要带走便雅悯,一切都与我作对。"照照那个呼喊,那里有一面镜子。所以我不想像那样。我不想那样说。

朋友们,如果你理解神的计划包括坏事,神的计划包括你的选择,神的计划包括小事,神的所有计划都在掌控每一个事件,目的和目标是让耶稣基督成为万有之首,成为万有之王,医治宇宙,那么你就理解了护理的教义。

如果你理解它,并开始以此为基础运作,在那个波长上,你开始一直提醒自己这些事情。那会对你产生什么影响?嗯,我最后要说的是,它会产生三个效果。

一是它会让你勇猛,勇猛。你看,如果你相信神和你一样憎恨邪恶,虽然在未来,你会受伤,你会被伤害,你会发现各种坏事发生在你身上和你周围。但你知道你可能输掉一场战斗,但你不会输掉战争。

你看,异教的邪恶观念是就是这样,接受它。现代的邪恶观念是它是随机的,让我们对抗它。但基督徒理解我们带着盼望争战。

有一种勇猛,你知道,最新的,Twilight Paris乐队的最后一张专辑,我想是第一面的第一首歌,一首歌《神在掌控》,哦,它不是最伟大的艺术作品,但歌词中有勇猛。

副歌唱道:"神在掌控。我们相信他的儿女不会被离弃。神在掌控。我们选择相信,我们选择记住,永不动摇。

我们选择记住,永不动摇。没有权柄在他之上或旁边。我们知道神在掌控。"有一种勇猛,你知道,当面对邪恶。我们选择记住,永不动摇。

这是你的选择。有一种勇猛,第二,也有一种满足,因为即使当事情变坏时,你知道神在对你做什么。有这本伟大的儿童小书叫《绒毛兔》,在《绒毛兔》中的一个地方,这两只动物,填充动物,育儿室里的两个玩具在互相交谈。

其中一个玩具对另一个玩具说:"变成真的是什么意思?"嗯,皮马说。

"当一个孩子爱你很长很长很长时间时,就会发生在你身上。不只是玩你,而是真的爱你,你就变成真的了。这需要很长时间。这就是为什么它不常发生在容易破碎、有尖锐边缘或必须小心保管的人身上。

一般来说,当你变成真的时,你的大部分毛发已经被爱掉了,你的眼睛掉出来了,你的关节都松了,你看起来很破旧,但这些事情根本不重要,因为一旦你是真的,你就不会是丑的,除了对那些不理解的人。"

你看,如果你理解基督王权的教义,你知道发生在你身上的每一件事都是神使你变成真的方式,即使你的毛发被爱掉了,或者你的眼睛掉出来了,你感觉有点破旧,你知道填充物从后面出来了。

但你看,有一种满足,因为你知道这是他计划的一部分,包括万事。但最后,这是一种警告,神护理的教义使我们谦卑。

因为你知道应许是:"万事都互相效力,叫爱神的人得益处。"现在,你知道那意味着什么吗?

"万事都互相效力,叫爱神的人得益处。"那意味着什么?意思是这个。非常重要。我要说的最后一件事,非常关键,希望你现在醒着,好吗?

如果发生的每一件事都是为了使基督为王这个目标而发生的,对吧?发生的每一件事都是为了那个目的而发生的。这意味着如果你已经让基督成为你生命的王,如果你让他成为你的救主和王,如果那是你活着的目的,如果那是你生命中最突出的渴望,那么世界上发生的每一件事,每一粒沙子,每一个原子,每一个分子,每一个事件都是为了你。

"万事都互相效力,叫爱神的人得益处。"但另一方面,如果你活着像自己的王,如果你拒绝了基督的王权,你可能很虔诚,但你是自己的主人,你决定,你发号施令。

如果你在对抗他的王权,那意味着宇宙中的每一个事件都在对抗你,没有中间地带。

要么宇宙中的每一个分子都为你效力,要么宇宙中的每一个分子都对抗你。你能看到吗?你让耶稣为王了吗?那么会怎样?

无论发生在你身上的是好事还是坏事,它都在使你更加接近他,朝向它。你知道,当好事发生时,你更接近神,因为你如此感恩。当坏事发生时,你更接近神。为什么?因为它向你显明你多么需要他。

但现在让我们看看一个拒绝基督王权的人。好事和坏事,好事只是让这个人感到我不需要神。坏事让这个人感到我不能信任他。

所以无论好事还是坏事发生在一个没有顺服基督王权的人身上,发生的每一件事,无论好坏或无所谓,都在使你刚硬,推你离开,使你远离。

你可以拥有一个宇宙,其中每一个原子都为你效力,或者每一个原子都对抗你,但没有中间地带。

今天的讲道中，提姆·凯勒要带我们看见，耶稣如何主动寻找我们、向我们启示真理，并呼召我们归向他。整个月我们都在看耶稣是谁的不同面向，今天我们要来看「耶稣作为君王」是什么意思。

顺带一提，先提醒一下，这个主题——我已经讲过这一篇讲道一次了，我大概把不少「草丛里的蛇」都惊出来了，却没有来得及一一打死。所以今天也差不多会这样。所以，很适合在四点聚会结束之后，照我们惯例，到楼下东侧休息室，一起做问答。聚会完、后奏结束后，我们会有问答时间。我几乎可以肯定，在讲道过程中，我会把一些问题从你心里的草丛里惊出来，但在讲道里未必能回答得让你满意。所以欢迎你把问题记下来，想一想，结束后跟我们一起下楼来参加问答。

现在，请看《以弗所书》第一章，我们读到：「都照他自己所喜悦的预定的美意，叫我们知道他旨意的奥秘，要照所安排的，在日期满足的时候，使天上地上一切所有的，都在基督里面同归于一头。在他里面，我们也得了基业，这原是那位随己意行作万事的，照着他旨意所预定的，叫他的荣耀，从我们这首先在基督里有盼望的人，可以得着称赞。」——这是上帝的话。

如果你把一个从南美雨林腹地出来、从来没去过别的地方的人，忽然放到时代广场的正中央，对他来说，那简直是混乱又疯狂的一幕。他会想知道：为什么人们要匆匆忙忙从这些楼梯往地底下跑？

他会想知道：为什么这些奇怪的金属动物在马路上呼啸而过？为什么人们拦下那些黄色的车，让它们当场「把自己吞进去」？他会有各种各样的问题。在他眼里，这一切看起来完全混乱失序，因为他看不出其中的目的是什么。在他眼里，这个世界充满了毫无意义的碎片。

如果你在纽约住了一阵子，时代广场在你眼中就没那么毫无意义了——当然，它还是有点荒谬。

不过，我想说的是：这个画面，其实非常贴切地说明了，很多人随着年纪增长，是怎样越来越看待自己的人生的。你年纪越大，就越觉得人生好像并不照「规则」在走。刚开始，当你年轻、在大学的时候，有很多事情你很确定「绝不会」发生在你身上，也有很多事情你绝不会去做。你心里有一套规则。你会说：「我的朋友当中，绝不会有人做那种事。」

可时间一久，你就开始怀疑：这些规则到底还在不在？「好人最后输掉」，「好人短命」之类的话——这些事真的会发生，确实正在发生。

在很实际的层面上，人随着年纪增长，会开始怀疑：人生到底有没有什么道理可言？有没有什么秩序？在思想层面上，这种怀疑更是明显；在当今知识界，越来越多思想家说，宇宙的根本其实就是「随机性」。过去的科学世界观，把宇宙看成一套机械装置，一切都由固定不变的定律支配；但现在，像史蒂芬·霍金以及许多其他领域的学者都在说：宇宙并没有什么终极的道理或秩序。人生是混乱的，历史是混乱的，只不过是一堆无序的东西罢了。这既是许多人在生活层面上的感受，也是当下知识界很普遍的看法。

然而，基督信仰——我要说——提供了对这种看法最美、最精致，也最有决定性的回答。而答案，其实就在我们刚才读的那段经文里：耶稣是王。也就是说，如果你走到那个来自南美雨林的人面前，看见他在时代广场快要崩溃了，你会拦住他，让他坐下来，对他说：「先冷静，我可以向你解释。」

当然，你不可能一下子就把一切都解释清楚。他要弄懂什么是地铁，可能就要花一段时间；他甚至可能还得先了解什么是电。但你至少可以说：「先别慌，这一切背后是有解释的。」

圣经也是这样。当我们看见自己的人生、看见历史似乎一团乱的时候，圣经走到我们面前，对我们说：「先冷静。」它说：「这一切是有解释的。」

不过，同样地，圣经也说：「我没法一夜之间把所有细节都解释给你听。」但它告诉我们：打开所有这一切的钥匙，就是基督的王权。接下来我要向你说明，这个答案是如何回应「历史看起来混乱」的观感，也要说明为什么这是对表面混乱最精致、最美、也是最有力的回答。

圣经说，基督的王权有两个面向，而这两个面向在我们的心里，必须既要分得清楚，又不能把它们拆开。要「区分，却不分离」。如果你不了解这王权的两个面向，如果你不明白它们并不相同，却同时存在；如果你不能既看见两者的差异，又看见它们彼此相连，你的人生和历史，在你眼中就会像那个可怜人眼中的时代广场一样混乱。

让我解释这两个面向。它们就在刚才的经文里。第一部分说到：「照他自己所喜悦的预定的美意……要在日期满足的时候，使天上地上一切所有的，都在基督里面同归于一头。」这在说什么？在说「将要到来的国度」。耶稣基督的国度正要来到。他的国度有一个未来的面向。

我仍然认为，解释这个最好的方式，是用这样一个比喻：上帝创造宇宙，有点像钟表匠制造钟表，只是有一个关键差别——上帝把自己放进了这只钟里。

上帝起初创造宇宙，某种意义上，有点像钟表匠造了一只钟，但上帝把自己「安置」在这钟的里面。而我们，人类，可以说就是那关键的齿轮。如果你能把这只钟——也就是宇宙——后盖打开，看见它原本被设计的样子，人类就位于正中央，上面与上帝相咬合，下面与受造界相咬合。我们原本是世界的「副摄政者」，是上帝在自然界中的代表。

但当我们决定要把「副」（副摄政者的「副」）拿掉的时候，当我们决定要自己做自己的王，要自己做自己的主宰时，发生了什么？那就好像那颗关键齿轮从轴心上脱落，掉进下面一堆轮子中间。就在我们决定要做自己人生的导演、做自己世界的摄政者的那一刻——就在我们要自己当王的那一刻——宇宙发生了什么事？

那一刻，好像钟里的齿轮纷纷错位，世界随之失衡、破碎、混乱。罪进入世界，一切开始失调。可是，经文告诉我们，上帝在基督里有一个奥秘的计划，有一天要在他里面，把天上地上一切所有的都重新汇聚、整合、归回到一个头——就是基督之下。

这就是基督王权的「未来面向」：上帝正在推动历史朝着一个方向前进，要在基督里重整万有。哪怕我们现在只看见许多表面上的混乱和失序，哪怕我们像那个来自雨林的人看时代广场一样，只能看到零散、混乱、莫名其妙的片段，但圣经说：在更深的一层，有一位王在治理，有一只看不见的手在推动一切走向一个终点——就是在基督里同归于一头。

宇宙所发生的一切，正是那种情况在钟表里会发生的事：钟开始冒烟、打磨、裂开、碎裂，各种发条、弹簧、杠杆往四面八方飞去。换句话说，宇宙开始解体。

我想，每一位科学家、每一位物理学家，甚至我盼望每一位心理学家，当然还有每一位圣经神学家都会承认：无论在物理层面、社会层面、属灵层面、文化层面，生命与宇宙都有一个共同的特性——就是走向败坏、走向衰退。

一切都在朽坏，一切都在走向分崩离析，一切都在瓦解、散掉，因为那颗关键的齿轮已经从轴心上掉落，滚到钟底。整个宇宙都在呻吟、在咯吱作响，事情再也运作不顺了。于是疾病和腐败进来了，不公与压迫进来了，恐惧与愧疚也进来了——这一切都因为我们不再与那位在上面的王咬合相连。

圣经告诉我们——你只要看看历史也看得出来——上帝允许这场悲剧自己演变发展。我们是有自由的道德主体，他任凭这件事发生，他让我们承受后果。但他也应许，不会永远让我们在自己的苦水里煎熬；他应许不会任凭我们永远灭亡。他应许有一天他要再来，再次设立他的国度，把人类重新安放回轴心的位置，再次从上面与我们咬合。当那一刻来到的时候，一切都会被医治——无论在身体上、社会上、属灵上，各方面都会被修复，一切会重新合一。

保罗在这里说的，就是这件事。他说：「这是他旨意中的奥秘，是他所喜悦的。」要「在日期满足的时候」实行出来。也就是说，这是上帝最终的目的，这是历史前进的方向——「要使天上地上一切所有的，都在基督里同归于一头」。

这句话意思是：眼下的一切都处于分裂、瓦解当中；但终有一天，它们要被重新聚集、重新整合，重新完整起来。我们的身体现在随着年岁增长而一点点崩坏，将来会被更新；我们的心灵如今破碎，将来要被修复；我们的人际关系等等的一切，都要在一个元首之下合一——那位元首就是基督。

「元首」这个观念，就是说基督是王。他要作世界的头，那是将来某个时刻：当「日期满足」的时候，一切都会被联合、被医治。他要作头，整个宇宙再次成为某种意义上的「他的身体」。什么是身体？身体就是一个由彼此交织、彼此配搭的有机系统组成的整全整体；而不是像现在的宇宙，只是一堆彼此对抗、互相拉扯的齿轮和滑轮。

这就是上帝最终的目的：当时间走到圆满，他要让耶稣基督作万有之王。所有的反叛都要被制止，他要把我们重新安放回轴心，与他从上而下再次咬合。当那一刻来到，我们其实无法真正想象那会是什么样子——但值得你每天花几分钟去思想、想象那一天。

圣经只给了我们一些又矛盾又壮丽的比喻，好让我们稍微窥见一点点。当他被立为王、成为一切的头那一日，死亡要死去，朽坏要朽坏，分裂要被拆散，疾病要得「绝症」，终结要被终结，暴力要被暴力粉碎，破坏要被毁灭……诸如此类。

「眼睛未曾看见，耳朵未曾听见，人心也未曾想到」——上帝为爱他的人所预备的是如此。

我很喜欢《星球大战》里有一幕，路克·天行者对韩·索罗说：「我们要去救公主，你知道为什么吗？因为她很有钱。」韩问：「有多有钱？」他说：「比你能想象的还多。」韩回头说：「我能想象的可多了。」

我们也能「想象得可多了」，对不对？那你想想，上帝为我们预备的，必须是多么不可思议，才会让他对我们说：「你根本想不到。」——「眼睛未曾看见，耳朵未曾听见，人心也未曾想到。」你觉得自己能想象出很多的喜乐吗？圣经说：不，你想象不出来。跟那一天相比，你想象的一切喜乐都微不足道。

在那一天，当上帝让基督真正「作万有之头」的时候，这一切就要发生。

不过，这只是他王权的一个面向。他将要完全掌权，国度要完全降临；但这里也提到了第二个面向，我们刚才已经略微提过——就是他现在已经是历史的君王。

他也许还没有在这个世界、在人类当中，把对他王权的所有抵抗都彻底制服；我们仍然能看见破碎，能看见身体的不完全，能看见到处都有痛苦与受苦。但历史本身，对他却没有任何抵抗的余地。

他对一切历史事件拥有绝对的主权。你看，这段经文讲到历史的意义：「要在日期满足的时候，使万有在基督里同归于一」。接着又说：「我们也在他里面得了基业，这原是那位随己意行作万事的，照着他旨意所预定的。」——他「行作万事」，也就是「一切」。

旧版《和合本》译作「随己意行作万事」，意思就是：他按着自己旨意的筹算，使万事互相配合、一同运行。

所以你要把基督王权的这两个面向连在一起，否则你就不可能看懂自己的人生。保罗在以弗所书第一章末了把两者连在一起，他说（意译）：上帝「又将万有服在他的脚下，使他为教会作万有之首；教会是他的身体，是那充满万有者所充满的。」

这是什么意思？就是说，虽然你现在还看不见耶稣基督已经在外在的层面上、在可见的世界里，完全得着冠冕，把一切对他王权的拒绝都压制住——因此你仍看得见破碎，看见身体的残缺，看见痛苦和患难无处不在——但此刻，历史已经在这位王的掌控之中。

你可以说，耶稣基督正坐在历史的驾驶座上，把整部历史的车，驾驶向那个终点——那个「欧米伽点」，其实也就是「阿尔法点」：在那里，他要「充满一切」。「充满万有」。

因此，现在所发生的一切——每一件事、每一个事件（稍后我们还会谈）——都在他的掌控之下，都是他这段经文所说的那个「计划」的一部分。他有一个蓝图；他现在正借着他对历史的主权，推进这份蓝图，好让将来他可以完全掌权，并完全医治整个宇宙。

有人会说：既然你说他掌管万有，那是不是连那场地震——那些屋顶塌下来、那些可怜的人在睡梦中死去——也是他事先安排的？如果上帝是王，如果耶稣是王，那为什么还有这么多苦难？

你看，这个问题忽略了这个答案的精细程度：耶稣的王权不是单一面向的，而是有两个面向。

他现在确实有一个计划，要把我们带到一个没有地震的世界；他有一个历史计划，要把我们带到一个没有杀戮、没有凶杀、没有死亡、什么邪恶都不存在的地方。但在带领我们到那里之前，许多事必须先发生。那么，是哪些事呢？

如果我们活在两千五百年前，我们根本不知道十字架是什么一回事。我们不会明白，也不会知道耶稣基督终有一天要来受死。如果他没有受死、没有为那些信他之人的罪付上代价，那么上帝就无法以合宜的方式来对待我们。那时候的人并不知道这一点，而我们现在知道了。

同样地，在「通往那一天」的道路上，还有许许多多我们现在看不清的站点。换句话说：上帝要带我们走向一个没有痛苦的地方，但通往那个没有痛苦的地方的道路，本身却会经过痛苦。通往冠冕的路，必然经过十字架。对耶稣是如此，对我们也是如此。

在某个层面上，我们其实是知道这一点的。很多人，尤其年纪越大，越会体会到：唯有最肤浅的人，才以为「一生没有挫折」会让人变得深刻——事实上刚好相反：没有困境的人，生命往往很浅薄；从没失败过的人，多半也很浮面。你在直觉上知道，如果没有困境，我们对自己几乎不会有什么真正的认识；如果没有患难，我们对上帝也不会有多少真实的认识。

这当中有很多我们还没办法完全理解的地方，但圣经向我们启示出一些线索：他的王权有两个面向。他正带领我们走向一个再也没有地震的地方，可在路上，他也会带我们穿过地震。他正带领我们走向一个只有冠冕、没有十字架的世界，可是在抵达之前，他自己先走上了十字架的道路，我们也要在路上背起自己的十字架。

我最近在读英国作家约翰·斯托得的一本书，他是这样说的：我之所以是个基督徒，其中一个主要原因就是——这个世界充满了苦难与痛楚，充满了邪恶与破碎，如果有一位神，却从未亲自受过苦，从未走过十字架，那我很难相信他。

他说：我无法相信一位从未受苦的上帝，一位没有走上十字架的上帝。而我之所以是基督徒，是因为在众多宗教之中，只有基督信仰向我们展现了一位亲自受苦、亲自担当苦难的上帝。

你看，圣经告诉我们：上帝憎恶那场地震，他憎恶那些灾难——可是，这些事却被编织进他的计划里。于是有人会问：「那你到底在讲什么？如果他真是王，为什么非得这么慢？为什么非得花这么久？为什么非得绕这么远？」

老实说，我也不能完全回答「为什么要这么久」。但我想，这种问题在上帝听来，大概就像我们做父亲时听到孩子的抱怨一样。

做父亲的大概都经历过类似的场景：你对三四岁的孩子说：「我们要去看外婆外公了，来，上车。」孩子高兴地喊：「太好了！」跳上车。开出去五分钟，他就问：「爸爸，我们到了吗？」你回答：「还没到。」——「为什么还没到？我累了，我现在就想到了。你不是说要带我去吗？为什么这么久？」

于是你说：「宝贝，从这里到外婆家的距离是三百五十英里，我们才开了五分钟，还要很久呢。」孩子接着说：「那你为什么不开快一点？你明明可以开更快啊。」在他的眼里，你是「全能的爸爸」，你当然可以开快一点。

于是你试着向一个四岁的孩子解释一点最基本的物理定律……他根本不想听。他的结论是：「你就是故意的，你就是坏！」到最后，你只好说：「宝贝，你才四岁，你还不懂物理。我唯一能告诉你的就是：把安全带系好，然后安静一点。」

你看，世上有许多极其博学、极其精巧的论述，试图凭着理性来否定上帝的存在，主要的根据就是：如果他真是王、真是要带我们进入一个不再有地震与苦难的世界，那我们为什么到现在还没到？

这些论证写得非常精致、非常深刻、细节很多，可归根结底，其实还是那句：「我们到了吗，爸爸？」「为什么还没到？你为什么不开快一点？」——然后，因为我自己想不通一个问题，而这个问题在上帝眼中，或许就像「小学物理」对我们一样简单，我就推论说：那可能根本没有上帝吧。

这是一种常见的反应。但你想想：如果耶稣基督真的是王，那有些事我们搞不懂，岂不是再合理不过？如果我们与他的关系，甚至就像我四岁的儿子与我之间的关系，那有些事情在我们眼里说不通，在他眼里却再简单不过，这不是理所当然吗？

换句话说：如果一切都合你理性中的逻辑，那反倒显得不合理了。正因为他是王、他是神，所以一定会有很多事在我们现在看来说不通——这个道理本身，其实是非常合理的。

因此，这个教义虽然说是「奥秘」，却是一个极其合理的奥秘：他在掌权，而我们不可能现在就懂一切。他说：「我要带你们去到那一天——在那一天，耶稣要充满万有，一切都在他里面合一。」同时，他也说：「在那之前所发生的一切，每一件事，都是我要把你带到那里的组成部分。」

一切所发生的，一切经历，都是为了把我们带到一个地方——在那里，耶稣基督要作万有之王。

那这在实际层面上意味着什么呢？我们刚刚说了：上帝掌管历史，因为他要带我们到那个「基督作王」的终点。那么他是怎么掌管历史的呢？

回到这节经文，我们现在读的是：「随己意行作万事」。我想和你稍微停留片刻，思想这句话，好帮助你看见，教会历史上把这个教义称为「上帝的护理」教义——即上帝的预备与安排。英文的 providence 这个词，来自 provide，也就是「预备、供应」的意思：凡事的发生，都是上帝的预备。

这个教义是独一无二的：它不同于人本主义，不同于世俗主义，也不同于伊斯兰教，不同于佛教或东方宗教；它是有自己独特样貌的。而这一切，都浓缩在一个词里面——「万事」（everything）。

如果你真的明白这个「万事」的含义，它会改变你的人生，改变你的心态，改变你明天面对生活的方式。只要你明白：他就是借着「万事」，在实际掌行他的王权。

「护理」（providence）——如果你明白这是什么意思：万事都按照他旨意中的筹算互相配合、运行——那会彻底改变你的生活方式。让我给你看几方面的含义。首先，「万事」这个词意味着什么？至少包含三层意思。

第一，「万事」意味着：上帝的计划包含「小事」。

上帝的计划里包括琐碎的小细节——必须如此。我们大多数人不会这样想「万事」。但《箴言》十六章说：「签放在怀里，定事由耶和华。」——你丢一枚硬币，它是正面还是反面，都是他计划的一部分。没有任何事被留在他计划之外。

你可能熟悉「浪子回头」的故事，但那不只是关于一个偏离正道的小儿子。事实上，耶稣讲这个故事，是要同时对那些远离上帝的人说话，也对那些想靠「乖、靠做好人」来赚取上帝喜爱的人说话。在《浪子神恩》（The Prodigal God）这本书中，提姆·凯勒借着这个广为人知的比喻，来呈现福音的核心：这是一则给「放浪小儿子」与「律法主义大儿子」的盼望信息，也是对所有人的邀请，要我们亲自经历上帝那种看似浪费、实则丰盛的恩典之爱。无论你已经是基督徒，还是还在探索信仰，《浪子神恩》都能帮你以全新的眼光，看见与基督的关系。

（以上是福音机构的广告内容，略。）

好，这是我要强调的第一点，但我想再把它推得更深一点。有人会说：「得了吧，你不会是说，连提姆·凯勒今天穿哪一条领带，都是上帝从亘古就定下来的吧？连我今天穿哪双鞋，也是他计划的一部分？」——这些看起来细枝末节的小事，真会被包括在里面吗？

答案是：那些事情之所以对你我来说是「小事」，只是因为我们太不智慧了。在上帝那里，没有真正的「小事」。

1912 年有人试图刺杀罗斯福总统，向他的胸口开枪。你知道他为什么活下来吗？因为那天刚好，他把眼镜盒放在这一边胸前口袋，而不是另一边。子弹先打在厚厚的眼镜盒上，致命程度大大降低。

你看，你的婚姻、你的职业、你读哪所学校，许多时候都取决于这些所谓的「小事」。

我可以给你举一个自己的例子。今天我之所以会成为一位长老会的牧师，很大程度上是因为在我神学院最后一个学期，有一位特别的老师来到学校，他在一些关键的神学问题上「推了我一把」，让我最终决定：是的，我应该加入长老会。可以说，我今天会站在这里，就是因为那位老师当年被请到我读书的那间神学院来任教。

那他为什么会来呢？他是英国人，原本要来我所在的麻省神学院任教，但签证、护照问题让他几乎要放弃。按当时的规定，他必须证明「没有任何美国公民能像他一样胜任这份工作」，整个流程极其复杂。他每天去美国大使馆排那种漫长的队，心里想：「我永远拿不到护照了，我根本来不了。」

直到有一天，突然有人从里面走出来，在人群中喊他的名字，把他叫进去说：「你一个礼拜之内就能成为美国人。」他说：「这是从很高层来的消息。」

你知道那是谁呢？那人叫麦克·福特（Mike Ford），是当时美国总统的儿子。他是我所在的戈登康威尔神学院的学生，想办法为这位老师「疏通关系」。

那你知道他父亲为什么会是总统吗？因为「水门事件」。正是由于水门事件，尼克松辞职，杰拉尔德·福特才会成为总统。也正是因为如此，他的儿子才有足够的影响力，帮助这位老师来到我们学校任教——于是我才成为长老会牧师，才会站在这里对你说这些话。

那尼克松为什么会垮台呢？因为某个愚蠢的「水门窃听者」某天晚上忘了把门关好，而有个警卫刚好发现门没关。如果那天警卫没走过那一段走廊呢？也许他之所以那天那么早巡逻，是因为那天早上没吃早餐，所以稍微提早出门上班……

你懂我的意思吗？如果那位警卫没有刚好发现那扇没关紧的门，我今天可能根本不会站在这里讲道。这就是你和我人生中许多事情的真实样貌：一件又一件看似微不足道的小事，却彼此紧扣、互相牵连。

雷·布拉德伯里早就洞察到这一点。他写过一个有关未来和时间旅行的短篇小说，故事里人们可以回到过去，但必须非常小心，只能走在悬空的磁力步道上，绝不能碰到任何东西，否则历史就会被改写。结果有个时间旅行者一不小心滑了一跤，踩死了一只蝴蝶，于是整个宇宙、整部历史都被改写了。

一切都是互相连结的。人若认真想一想，就很难再说：「你是说上帝把一切都计划好了？」因为仔细想想，你会发现：根本没有别的可能性。

想象一下：如果真的存在所谓的「完全偶然」，那一个清醒、认真思考的人每天早晨从床上爬起来该有多害怕？想到「任何事都可能发生」，想到哪怕最微小的事情，都可能完全改变你的人生轨迹、改变整个人类文明——那才是真正的恐怖。

上帝的计划包含一切——这一点，正是我们安全感的来源。

第二，「万事」也意味着：上帝的计划同样包含我们的选择。

这一点往往是人最难接受的。刚才我们说，上帝的计划包含小事，每一件小事都是他计划的一部分——「万事都在他的计划之中」。你的第一反应可能是：「那太可怕了，这不就表示我们都被命定要做某些事吗？我们根本没有自由？这不就是宿命论吗？」

但不是这样的。恰恰相反，这恰恰不是宿命——而我们之所以知道不是宿命，正是因为这里用了「万事」这个词。

我要讲的第二点就是：上帝的计划包含我们的抉择。古希腊有自己的宿命论，古罗马也有；伊斯兰也有某种形式的「天命」（kismet）；但所有这些宿命观都有一个共同特点：它们不真正把人的选择包括在那位掌权者的计划里面。

一种宿命论的思想体系。万事万物都被固定了，除了我们的选择。让我给你一个例子。在所有的希腊神话里，如果有预言说某个女人或某个男人注定要犯罪、

注定要成为罪犯，

如果那个可怜的人花上好多年努力行善，努力过一个好人的生活，努力避免犯罪的人生，其实都没有用。为什么呢？因为在希腊的世界观里，在宿命论的世界观里，如果你被注定要成为罪犯，那你做什么都没用。你是“被注定的”，与你的选择无关。无论你多么努力想做一个好人，你还是被注定、被命定成为一个罪犯。这就是宿命论运作的方式。

换句话说，一切都被固定了，除了你的选择。你可以随便做选择，但其实改变不了什么。

可是基督教不同。基督教说：万事万物都是神计划的一部分，
包括你的选择。
这个计划是借着你的选择被成就、也包含你的选择，而不是排除你的选择。 这意味着一件既简单又深奥、既神秘又合理的事：那就是，你的每一个选择，始终都是那计划的一部分。

来看雅各。雅各得罪了他的父亲，抢夺了他哥哥的祝福。结果，他不得不离家，去到异乡生活，过了一段非常痛苦的人生。然而，正是在那异乡，他遇见了他一生所爱的拉结。他们在那里生下的孩子当中，出了弥赛亚耶稣基督的祖先。

所以很明显，雅各必须犯罪、必须去到那片异乡，耶稣才会在那里“按着计划”出生。而耶稣显然是出于神的计划，对吗？是的。因此，那罪也在计划当中，对吗？是的，当然。

然而，那罪同时又是出于自由意志的选择。那罪是他自己负责的，没有人强迫他，却又是计划的一部分。那些临到他生命中的苦果，也既是出于那计划、也是出于他的选择——两者一起发生、一起运作。

雅各完全是自由的，他要为自己的行为完全负责，可与此同时，发生在他身上的每一件事情，又全部都在那计划当中。这两者同时成立。神在掌权，我们仍有自由。为什么？因为一切都是计划的一部分。

神从不会在“无视你选择”的前提下，先把你的命运钉死在那儿。

你知道司布真有个很棒的故事，常常拿来讲。他路过时，……

司布真相信这一切。他是一位浸信会的传道人。

有一次他去探望一位生病的朋友，就问他：“你现在怎样？”那位朋友说：“唉，我不知道自己该不该吃药。”

司布真就问：“为什么？”

那人说：“嗯……我不知道神是预定我要活还是要死。”

照理说，司布真可以给他上一大课：在希腊那种“命运”观里，如果你注定要死，那你做什么都没用；但在基督徒的观念里不是这样的。哦不，在基督教的看法里，你的每一个选择，都和神的计划紧紧相连。

于是他没有讲长篇神学课，而是这样回答：“我亲爱的朋友，我可以很准确地告诉你会发生什么：

如果你吃药，你就是被预定要活；
如果你不吃药，你就是被预定要死。”

因为一切，一切，都是他计划的一部分。

这听起来极其合理，尽管你没办法把其中所有逻辑都完全算清楚。在《使徒行传》中有一段很棒的记载，第27章，保罗在一艘船上。那艘船在可怕的风暴里。保罗站起来说：“神已经指示我，这船上的人一个也不丧命，但船要损坏。”——我们会遇上海难、船会毁掉，但不会有人死。神已经说话了，这是一个预言，对吧？

然而，就在几节经文之后，几个兵丁想要偷偷下到救生艇去。保罗就跑过去说：“如果你们上了救生艇，我们都要死。不要上救生艇。”

这话就出现在他刚刚说“一个也不丧命”之后没几节。那他们怎么办？他们说：“好，保罗说不要这样做，不然我们会丧命。”所以他们就不下去了。结果呢？当然，最后一个人也没死。

为什么？因为你看见了吗，神从来不是在撇开你选择的前提下，把你的命运固定死，而是透过你的选择来成就他的计划。和宿命论不同，在神那里，一切都在他的计划之中。

这意味着，朋友们，当你面前有一个选择的时候，要认真地去做那个选择。不要耸耸肩说：“反正没差。”因为如果你做了一个好的选择，你的处境就会比较好；如果你做了一个糟糕的选择，各种可怕的后果就会发生。

然而，知道这一点的同时，这个伟大教义的奇妙之处在于：你也必须明白，……

你其实没办法把自己的人生搞砸，搞到超出神为你所预备的界限之外。

而他说，他对你的旨意是，他爱你。你做不出那种事情来，让神突然一脸惊慌，好像被你打了个措手不及。神从不会在天上看着你说：“天哪，她怎么会做这种事？那我现在怎么办？我只好让她嫁给那个人好了，但我也不太确定……”——神不是这样运作的。

你做了一个坏选择，就是做了一个坏选择；你做了一个愚蠢的选择，就是做了一个愚蠢的选择；你冲动、鲁莽、作恶，必然会有后果。然而，即便如此，一切仍然在他的计划之中。

你不能把自己的人生完全搞砸。他正在其中工作。

但最后一点：他的计划既然包括一切，也就包括小事。他的计划既然包括一切，也就包括我们的选择。而神对历史的掌管、他作为君王的统治，既然包括一切，也就包括那些坏事。

我知道这是最难接受的一点。但让我讲一个故事来解释。神恨恶那些坏事，却仍然把那些坏事纳入他的大计划当中。他把它们编织进他的计划里。有人会问：为什么？

嗯，我刚才其实已经讲过一遍：在其中一部分，我们必须承认这仍然是奥秘。这是一个你必须说：“我是孩子，你是父亲”的地方。好吧？我不明白为什么我们不能那么快就当外婆（或实现某个我们期待的事），但是另一方面，我也明白你是父亲。好，我会把安全带系好，我会安静下来。”

然而，感谢主，圣经没有把我们当成只会哭闹的婴儿，它给了我们比这更多的东西。它给了我们一些极美的故事。让我举一个例子。

“万事都照着他旨意所预定的计划一起运作”；或者用罗马书8:28的话说：“万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处。”

这一真理最经典的故事之一，就是雅各和约瑟的故事。

雅各是一个族长，是一个有十二个儿子的男人，他做了一个父亲能做的最愚蠢的决定：他把心完全偏向十二个儿子中的一个——约瑟。他对这个孩子百依百顺，溺爱不已；他对这个年轻人倾注了所有的爱，使得他显然成了家中的“掌上明珠”。没有什么比这种偏爱更能把痛苦注射进一个家庭的了——而它确实带来了痛苦。

随着约瑟长大，因为他是……

被溺爱、被围着转，他正在变成一个骄傲的孩子，正在变成一个肤浅、空洞的人——那种从这种溺爱环境里长出来的典型的肤浅、空洞的人。与此同时，其他弟兄却在慢慢变成疏离而充满怨恨的孩子，变成疏离而怨恨的年轻人。终于，他们的怨恨增长到一个地步，使他们能够做出极其可怕的事情。

他们绑架了约瑟，把他丢进一个坑里，把他卖为奴隶，然后告诉父亲说他已经死了，被野兽撕碎。父亲因为把约瑟当作自己的“神”、当作自己的偶像，于是完全绝望，多年陷入严重的抑郁当中。而那些做了这件事的儿子——这些兄弟们——也带着罪责活下去，随着岁月流逝，那种内疚变得越来越难以承受，他们彼此之间也越来越疏离，与父亲疏离，整个家庭的生活变得痛苦不堪。

但约瑟没有死。他被卖到埃及作奴隶，在奴役的艰苦中、在埃及的重重挫折中，他得着了父亲雅各根本无法给他的东西——品格、韧性、老练、智慧，他学会了紧紧依靠神。这一切把他里面的潜质锤炼出来——这些潜质如果他一直待在家里，是永远不会被唤醒的。最终，他一路被高举，成为埃及的宰相。

凭着他从神而来的远见，他意识到将要有大饥荒临到，就推行了一个储粮计划——在丰年累积粮食，以致饥荒临到时，人们不会全部饿死。他负责把丰年积存的粮食分配给饥荒年的人们，使得那些年间人们不至于饿死。

这场饥荒一路蔓延，直到雅各和剩下的十一个儿子所在的那地。雅各就差派其中十个儿子下到埃及去买粮，好让他们不至饿死。

当他们到了埃及，看见约瑟的时候，约瑟认出了他们，但约瑟的身份对他们是隐藏的——他们认不出他。约瑟简直不敢相信自己所看见的，是他的兄弟们。他里面既想报仇，又想试验他们。

于是他问：“你们是谁？”他们就解释。

他们说：“我们是从远方来的弟兄，一共有十二个兄弟，其中一个已经死了，还有一个跟我们年老的父亲在一起。”

约瑟说：“你们是奸细，你们来窥探这地的虚实，好把情报送给外敌。”

他们忙说：“不，不是的，一点都不是这样。我们真的是兄弟。”

宰相就说：“好，我告诉你们我要怎么做。我会留下你们其中一个兄弟——我会留下西缅，把他关在这边的监牢里。我只给你们一点点粮食，让你们回去。但如果你们想要更多的粮食，不想饿死，就必须证明你们真的是一家人：

把那最小的弟弟——你们口中所说的便雅悯——带来这里给我看。那时我就知道你们说的是真的。若是你们不带便雅悯回来，就永远见不到我的面，也永远得不到这里的粮食，你们都会饿死。”

于是，他们难过地回到雅各那里，对父亲说：“我们带回了一点粮食，但如果要再去一次，就必须带便雅悯去。”

这时，雅各在《创世记》42章36节里发出一声呼喊——我认为那是一个人在没有把人生放在基督为王的视角之下时，最典型、最经典的呼喊。他说，大意是：“你们说一定得带便雅悯回去，我们必须回去。但不行！约瑟没有了，西缅也没有了，如今你们还要把便雅悯从我身边带走，一切都与我作对了！”

“约瑟没有了，西缅也没有了，如今你们还要带走便雅悯，一切都与我作对了。”

就在他发出这句感叹的时候，神正为雅各“移山填海”。如果雅各当初没有失去约瑟，约瑟与整个家族如今早就灭亡了。如果雅各没有失去约瑟，那整个地区的人现在都会在饥荒中死去。

正是通过“失去约瑟”这件事，神在医治约瑟；神在谦卑那些兄弟；神在拯救整个地区的经济；神也正在拆毁那些毁坏雅各生命、扭曲他人生的偶像。

神正在动用一切——动用天地万有——来为雅各做事。

但这是雅各当时的想法吗？不是。他说什么？“一切都与我作对了。约瑟没有了……”

可事实上，约瑟不过是向他隐藏了起来，约瑟……

其实正在被预备。西缅“没有了”？不，西缅其实也很好，他也正在被预备。

“一切都与我作对了。”——如果你拒绝相信神比你知道得更多，如果你拒绝相信他是王、他是良善的，那么，你看自己人生的方式，就永远会像雅各这样。

那你呢？

当你现在回头看自己的人生时，你的感觉是什么？你是不是也有这样的呼喊？

你心里说：“我这辈子再也不可能遇见真爱了。我再也不可能成功了。那些东西都没了，一切都在和我作对。”——你是不是这样感觉？

这当然可以理解。看看雅各，他就是这样感受、这样看事情的。他是个族长，可一点也不愚蠢；他不是傻子，你也不是傻子。你有这种感受，并不说明你很蠢。

但你还是错了。你错了。要小心。

照照那句呼喊的“镜子”。“约瑟没有了，西缅没有了，你们又要把便雅悯带走，一切都在和我作对。”——照照那面镜子，对自己说：“我不要变成那样。我不要这样说。”

朋友们，如果你明白：神的计划包括坏事；神的计划包括你的选择；神的计划包括那些小事；而所有这一切，都是在控制每一个事件，指向同一个终点——使耶稣基督在万有之上作王，成为万有的焦点，医治整个宇宙——那么你就明白了“护理”的教义。

如果你明白这一点，并开始在这样的频率上生活，不断提醒自己这些真理，这会对你有什么影响？

我最后只想说，它至少会产生三个果效。第一，它会让你变得“有股横劲”，有一种不轻易屈服的精神。

你看，如果你相信神恨恶邪恶，就像你恨恶它一样；而且你也知道，虽然在他的计划里，你仍会受伤、会被伤害，会看见各种坏事临到你和你周围的人，但你同时知道，你最多只是输掉一场战役，却不会输掉整场战争。

异教对邪恶的看法是：事情就是这样，认命吧。现代人对邪恶的看法则是：它是随机的，没意义，我们就拼命跟它对抗吧。

但基督徒知道，我们是在“满有盼望”中争战。那里面带着一种勇敢的劲头。你知道吗，最新一张 Twilight Paris 的专辑……

那张专辑里——我想是第一面第一首——有一首歌叫《God is in Control》（上帝在掌权）。哦，它也许称不上什么伟大的艺术作品，但歌词里面有一种“硬气”。副歌这样唱：

“God is in control（神在掌权）。
我们相信，他的儿女必不被撇弃。
God is in control。
我们选择相信，我们选择记念，并且永不动摇。
我们选择记念，并且永不动摇。
没有任何权势在他之上、与他并列。
我们知道，God is in control。”

那里面有一种“我就偏要仰望神”的劲头，对着邪恶、对着苦难说：“我们选择记念，并且永不动摇。”——那是一个选择。这里面是一种“有股横劲”的信心。

其次，它也会带来一种满足感，因为即便事情看起来不顺，你也知道神在你身上做什么。

有一本很棒的儿童书叫《绒布小兔》（The Velveteen Rabbit）。书里有一段，两只玩具在育婴室里彼此说话。其中一只问另一只：“什么叫变成真的（real）？”

“嗯，”皮马（Skin Horse，皮马玩具马）说，“那是一个会发生在你身上的事情：当一个孩子很长、很长、很长一段时间爱你——不是只是拿你来玩一玩，而是真的爱你——你就会变成‘真的’。这需要很长时间。这就是为什么，那些很容易破碎、棱角很锋利、需要被小心收藏的人，往往很难变成‘真的’。一般来说，等你成了真的，你身上的毛大多都被摸掉了，眼睛也掉了，你的关节松松垮垮，你看起来很破旧。但这些都一点也不重要，因为一旦你成了真的，你就不可能再丑；只有那些不懂的人才会觉得你丑。”

你看，如果你理解基督为王的教义，你就知道，发生在你身上的每一件事，都是神在让你“变成真的”，即便你觉得自己头发都被“摸秃”了、眼睛都快掉出来，整个人破破烂烂、填充物都从背后露出来了。可你仍然可以有一种心满意足，因为你知道，这一切都在那包含万事的计划里。

但最后，这里有一个带着警告意味的结论：神护理的教义会让我们谦卑。

因为应许是——“万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处。”那这意味着什么？

“万事……互相效力，使爱神的人得益处。”这是什么意思？

意思是这样——非常重要，也是我今天最后要说的一点：

如果所有发生的事，都是朝着同一个目标推进——让基督作王，对吗？所有发生的事情，都在朝那个终点前进。那就意味着，如果你已经让基督在你生命中作王，如果你已经让他作你的救主、你的王，如果这成了你人生最优先追求的事，如果那是你生命中至高的渴望，那么，世上发生的每一件事、每一粒沙子、每一个原子、每一分子、每一个事件，都是为你而运转的。

“万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处。”

但如果相反，你仍然活在“自我作王”的状态里，你拒绝基督的王权——你也许很有宗教外表，却仍然是自己的主人，由你自己做决定、你自己说了算；如果你是在抵挡他的王权，那就意味着：宇宙里发生的每一件事，都是与你作对的——而且中间没有灰色地带。

要么宇宙中每一个原子都向着你，要么宇宙中每一个原子都与你为敌。

你看得出来吗？你若让耶稣作王，那会怎样？无论临到你的是好事还是坏事，都是把你更往他那里推近。好事发生时，你因感恩而更贴近神；坏事发生时，你因看见自己的需要而更贴近神。

但现在我们再看看一个拒绝基督王权的人。好事和坏事临到他，好事只会让他更觉得“我不需要神”；坏事只会让他觉得“我不能信靠他”。所以，无论是好事、坏事还是普通的小事，临到一个不顺服基督王权的人时，每一件事都在使他的心更刚硬，把他推得更远、更远。

你可以活在一个宇宙里，其中每一个原子都向着你，也可以活在一个宇宙里，其中每一个原子都与你为敌——但绝对不存在折中的第三种情况。
