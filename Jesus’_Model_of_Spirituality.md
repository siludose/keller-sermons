today's teaching from the sermon on the Mount, Tim Keller shows how Christ offers  us practical guidance for living out a compelling vision of a new kind of community shaped  by grace. In your bulletin, we come to the part of the sermon on the Mount, very famous part,  part that you come to Redeemer, you actually recite part of this every week. Matthew chapter 5, pardon me, Matthew chapter 6, verses 5 through 13. And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, or they love to pray. Standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men, I tell you the  truth they have received their reward in full.

But when you go, when you pray, go into your room, close the door, and pray to your father  who was unseen, then your father who sees what is done in secret will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like the pagans, for they think they will be  heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your father knows what you need before you ask him. This then is how you should pray. Our father in heaven, how would be your name?

Your kingdom come, you will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread, forgive us our debts as we have also, as we have forgiven  our debtors, and lead us not in temptation, but deliver us from evil. This is God's Word. Now we are going through the sermon on the Mount, and we come to the subject of prayer,  and this actually, believe it or not, is a very hot topic in our society today. In the culture in general, the last few years there has been an explosion of interest  in prayer and spirituality, in meditation, and spiritual experience.

This year, on the first Monday of the month, we get our small group leaders together,  our ministry leadership together, and I went through and talked about meditation and prayer,  and one thing that was very striking to me is just how much hunger there was there,  and amongst our own leaders for this. But the importance, actually, for Jesus of prayer, is to some degree revealed in this little  unobtrusive word that you'd probably miss at the very, very top of the page, the very  beginning of the passage in verse 5, little word, and, and. This prayer is an standalone for Jesus. It's connected. See, there are places where we've already seen in the sermon on the Mount, where Jesus  almost seems to talk like a sort of social justice radical activist, you know, there's  a place in the luke in version of the sermon on the Mount, where Jesus says, and I quote,  sell your possessions and give them to the poor, unquote.

And right before this passage, in chapter 6, Matthew 6, one to four, Jesus is talking  about our engagement with the poor and our giving of the poor and our, our intense engagement  with the worlds and the needs of the world, and then he gets to verse 5, and he says, and  when you pray, and when you pray, now look, when you're talking and you're talking about  something is, and that means it's connected. He doesn't say, well, let's change the subject. Let's get on to prayer, I don't know. In Jesus' mind, in Jesus' understanding, it is the people, I'll say it's slowly, it  is the people who are characterized by the most radical interiority that have the most  courageous, visionary engagement with the world. It is the people who are most characterized by radical interiority, an incredible inner  life of prayer that are, their life is characterized by buoyant, promiscuous generosity and engagement  with the needs of the world.

Jesus does not put these things against each other, as a matter of fact, he says, they  really can't happen without each other. If you're really praying, it drives you out. And if you're really effective out there, it's coming from within. Real interiority, now I'm using that term because there's a book, and by the way, if you're  starting to read on prayer, this should not be one of your first fifteen books. It's a little hard to read, in many ways, don't make it your sixteenth, all right?

But there's a very famous book by St. Teresa of Avila called the Interior Castle. And it's a beautiful image, it's a fascinating image. She says, when you, in your soul, actually find the king. When you actually get into the, into ultimate spiritual reality, when you actually get in  connection with the cosmic throne room, your soul, your insides become a castle of light  and of love and of radiance.

There's a radical radiance, an interior radiance that happens, and that Jesus says is the thing  you've got to have, if you're going to have this incredible life in the world. You see, Jesus sees the importance of prayer, and however, Jesus gives us a model of prayer  and spirituality, and before he gives us the model, which is in versus, you know, the  famous Lord's Prayer in verse 9 and following, he tells us two other models that we should  avoid. This is very important, very important to see, you know, Jesus is very, he's willing to  be negative in order to be positive. He says, I'm going to give you a model of spirituality, and if you understand it, and if  you receive it, and if you use it, then it's going to have this tremendous effect on  your life. You know, I've just heard tons of people say to me over the years, I've tried prayer,  but it didn't work.

Now, by the way, I have something at home that looks like a coffee maker, but it's a  tea maker, and I like it very much. But if you ever stay in my house and you try to make coffee in it, you're going to say  this coffee maker doesn't work. No, it won't, because it's not built to brew coffee, it's built to brew tea. And when people say, I've tried prayer, it didn't work. What Jesus is saying is, well, you used prayer, not the way I designed it, but you used  a false model of spirituality.

And what he does here in this paragraph in verses 5-8, he gives us two false models  of spirituality. And then he turns around verses 9 to the end, and he gives his own model. Now, let's take a look at the false models and then his own models, and we'll conclude  with some practical stuff, because people have been pressing me. So when you get to the sermon on the mount, the whole idea on the sermon on the mount  is practical. Tell me how to do this.

Don't just make me say, don't just let me walk away feeling like I ought to pray more. How? So let's look at the false models, the true model, and a couple of practical ideas here on how  to go about it. The two models, and now look, if you look carefully, you'll see that Jesus says in verse  5, when you pray, do not be like, and on verse 7, he says, and when you pray, do not be  like. He has two groups of people, and he says, when you pray, don't use these models, or you'll  be brewing coffee in a tea maker, and it won't work.

First model is religious prayer. When you pray, don't be like the hypocrites for they love to pray, standing in the synagogue  and on the street corners to be seen by men. Now, when you first read this, the first impression is, these are, these are fanatic  texts. They like to pray in the synagogue, while people did stand and pray in the synagogue. This is formal worship, but it also says, on the street corners, and right away that evokes  a picture of some guy walking along, and not here, 69th, and Park, and suddenly praying  out loud and everybody saying, well, I mean, this is New York and so.

That's not what it's trying to evoke. The street corners meant a town square, a place where the streets came together. And the connotation is this, these are people who not only go to formal worship services,  but they lead in prayer in community, civil, religious events. And this is what Jesus is getting at with this kind of prayer. Is there anything wrong with that?

Is there anything wrong with coming and praying in church or synagogue? Is there anything wrong with leading in prayer at large public events? And the answer is no, but he says, this kind of person has no interior personal prayer  life. You see, he contrasts it with the people he says, but when you pray, go in your room. These are people who have a public prayer life, but not a private prayer life.

And the reason is, the reason they see for prayer is it makes them fit in with a social  order to be seen by men. This is like, religious prayer is where prayer and worship functions as helping you fit  into your family, fit into your town, fit into your social order, fit into your people,  fit into your culture, and it puts you in the right place. It's like when the politician ends his speech by saying, and may God bless us all, he has  no prayer life, and all the people love it. And they tell the focus group people, oh, I don't really like that, but they don't have  a prayer life either. But everybody feels better.

Everyone feels better because in a sense, it baptizes the social order, or it's like  this. The average person in the world, if you say, why are you Muslim? Why are you Catholic? Why are you Presbyterian? Why are you Baptist?

And the average person says, if they're honest, because that's where I'm from. You know, I'm Italian, so I'm Catholic. I'm Arabic, so I'm Muslim. I'm from Tennessee, so I'm Baptist. I'm...

Well, yeah. In other words, well, this is my people, this is who I am, and what this means is not  look at. We're not talking about people who come and they're all dead inside. When people who's basically prayer and worship is religious, it's cultural. If you were raised in a kind of church, you're raised in a kind of service, and this is  who your people are, see?

And this is who your town is, and this is who your tribe is, and this is your family  is. You're used to it. You had a kind of an inner peace when you go, and you do feel what? You feel good, or there's certainly some sense of stability, and there's some sense of  inner peace when it... But here's what Jesus is saying.

You are not relating to God, you're relating to an environment, a social environment. You feel... You're connected to your roots, that's why you feel good, or you feel maybe even some nostalgia  or familiarity, or just a sense of being part of my tradition, but it's a connection  to the tradition, or to your family, or to your roots, or to your social order, but it's  not a connection to God. And he says the sign of that is that when you go into your private closet to pray, you've  got nothing to say. There's no passion to know him.

There's no passion to meet with him. There's no passion to want to be with him. You don't sense that at all. You pray maybe when there's trouble, but when there's no trouble, when there's nothing  forcing you, when there's no social reason, when there's no family reason, when there's  no circumstantial reason. You don't have any internal pressure to actually know him, or meet him, or see him.

And Jesus says, this is the sign that you're basically... This is just religious prayer, you're not really connected to him, you're connected to  an environment. The environment makes you feel kind of good, but you're not actually connected to him at  all. The sign is, you don't have a continual, growing, personal, secret, private prayer life. You don't know what to say.

You're bored when you get to it, just by yourself. Now, let me take the gloves off for a second before we move on here. This is Jesus' words. How do you know if you're a hypocrite? How do you know if you're a hypocrite?

Now, do you know what a hypocrite is? A hypocrite is something that somebody who's one thing on the outside and another thing  on the inside. How do you know you're a hypocrite? Well, we don't go to the place he goes. We go to sex.

We say, he says he's so moral, but he's having an affair on the side. But Jesus doesn't use sex as your test for hypocrisy. I'm not saying that's right, but that's not the test. That's not the most telling test. Well someone says, let's take a look at money.

He says, she says they're very devoted to God, but you know, they're selfishly spending  money on themselves. They don't give it to the poor. They don't give it to the church. Of course, that's bad, too. However, Jesus says, that's not the acid test.

That's the acid test that you're a hypocrite. You don't have a prayer life. There's a sermon I read years ago when I was in seminary by Jonathan Edwards. Jonathan Edwards wrote this sermon years ago, and the name of it was hypocrite's deficient  in the duty of prayer. And I had nightmares for about a month after I read that sermon because this is simply  what he says.

He says there's only one thing that you don't do for show in the Christian life. There's only one thing. It's secret prayer because everything else is for show. Everything else somebody sees. Secret prayer is the only thing you do just for God, just for Him, not for anybody else,  not even for yourself, just for Him.

It's the only thing in your life you don't do, you Christian life you don't do for show. And therefore, if you do everything else but secret prayer, all of your Christian life  is just for show. Admit it. You don't have a secret prayer life. He says that's a sign of hypocrisy.

That's a sign that the reason you pray is because of your environment, not because of  God. You're trying to... Okay, you got that enough, that's enough. You feel bad enough. Let's move on.

Jesus actually, though, very interestingly, and it's a little weird, except it's actually  easier to see today. He turns to another group. And down to verse 70 says, and when you pray, don't keep on babbling like the pagans. Now, this is a little hard to translate. First of all, the word babble is a hotbox Lagomana in all of Greek literature.

This word is used not only only here in the whole Bible, but it's only used here in  all Greek literature we know, it's no other place. And it kind of means a torrent of words, sort of a intense torrent of words, not just  many words, but kind of frantic words. And the word pagans is Jesus' word, ethne, which is often also translated nations, but  in the New Testament, it usually means the unreligious. It means the licentious. It means the immoral.

It means the non-religious. Now, why is Jesus talking about non-religious prayer? Well, to one thing that would be interesting to go to in a tangent, but I won't. One thing Jesus is saying here is there really isn't such a thing as a prayerless heart. What he's really saying is something now, you know, snotty Christians over the years  have put it this way.

There are no atheists and foxholes. That's a pretty snotty way to put it. But what he's really, what Jesus is saying is that prayer is the involuntary reflex of  the heart. No matter what you say you believe, no matter what you think about the universe, the  fact is when you feel your humanity, when you feel your vulnerability, you can't stop  yourself from praying. No matter what you say you believe, there are times in which you can't not pray, which  means that your heart knows, in spite of what you're going to like telling you, there's  a God and you need him.

The torrent comes out, no matter who you are, but that's not all. Jesus says, they think they will be here, heard, for their torrent. Robert Wuth now, I quoted him in the fall, it's a really worthwhile book to read. Where Robert Wuth now wrote a book recently called After Heaven, he's probably the leading  sociologist of religion, he teaches at Princeton University, a very prominent man, and he's  the book After Heaven was a very, very thoroughgoing sociological reflection and study of spirituality  today. He says, and this is fascinating in light of this passage, he says that the older approach  to spirituality in this country was what he called, he called it an inhabiting, an inhabiting  model, an inhabitation.

He says, the inhabiting model was, you went to sacred places out of family tradition, sounds  like what we've just talked about, the religious approach. He says, in the past, people went to sacred places, churches, synagogues, cathedrals, out  of the tradition of your people and of your family, but he says, the newer version is  sprung up in the last two years, are by people who say, I hate religious institutions. I'm spiritual, I'm not religious, everybody has to decide what is true or right for him  or herself, everyone has to decide who God is for him or herself, everybody has to decide  that for yourself. I'm putting my own religion together, but basically they say, I'm not religious, I'm spiritual  and they're really into prayer, they don't go to church, they don't want to be part  of something like that, but they're into meditation, they're into all sorts of spiritual exercises,  they're into all sorts of spiritual emphasis on touching the spiritual, but Robert Wuth  now rightly so and it's very fair of him and he's very careful man, he's a leading scholar. He says, in the end, it's not much different than religious prayer, the older version.

He calls this the seeking model of spirituality and the older one, the inhabiting model. One says, I'm here, this is my place, these are my people, that's why I pray the way I do. And the seeking model is a kind of journey who says, well, we never really arrive, we never  really have any answers, we're just always seeking. He says, one of the big problems is, whereas the former was culture driven, this one is  technique driven, new spirituality is very technique driven, you have visualization techniques,  you have relaxation techniques, extremely technique driven, but in the end, it's not really  trying to reach God either, it's trying to use this divine to get the kind of inner  peace and spirituality you feel like you need to get to your goals. You see, the old religious approach basically baptizes the social order, that's the reason  why the older religious traditions to some degree have been rejected because very often  the oppression and the injustice and the bigotry of the old social orders were baptized  by the religious tradition.

But you know what's interesting is the newer spirituality in many ways also is essentially  just a way of sort of spiritually baptizing my goals in life. For example, if you use the more modern spiritual technique, let's say you're a baseball  player and you're trying to kind of use spiritual techniques to be a better baseball, but you  just visualize yourself hitting at home run over and over and over again. You know what you're saying is, this is the world I want, and I'm going to use the divine  to get there. And Robert Wuth now is smart enough to say, that's just as superficial as the old approach,  because instead of submitting to something, instead of really being changed, you're basically  using the divine to get what you want. And Jesus says, they think they'll be heard because of their parent.

They think because I've got, I can do something, I can change things, I can create the world  the way I want it, I can visualize the world the way I want it, I can put myself in a position  where I'm reaching my goals, Jesus says, no, no, no, no. No, he says, both of these are wrong and they're bad models. My model is this. And in the Lord's Prayer, and by the way, this summer, our preaching team is going to go  through the Lord's Prayer because spirituality is so hot, and we're going to have a number  of pastors go through it. But here's what I would say is a kind of summary, which by no means a hopeful steal the thunder  either from my own serpents on the Lord's Prayer this summer or anybody else's.

But he basically says this, my model of spirituality is this, the purpose of prayer, what is prayer  really about? Is it to get things, is to get inner peace, is it to, what is prayer about? He says it's to experience the friendship of God and experience the Lordship of God out  of a realization of our sonship with God. It's an experience of friendship and an experience of Lordship out of a realization of our sonship. Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer?

Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith? For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding  of what it means to follow Christ. A great resource to start using this summer is the new city catechism devotional, God's  truth for our hearts and minds. This devotional brings the historic catechisms of the Christian Church to life, offering  a question to consider for each week of the year. In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catechesis, the rich and communal  practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers that frame the foundational beliefs  of the Christian faith.

Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer, and a brief meditation that will challenge  and inspire you. The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller,  and Kevin D. Young, as well as historical figures such as Augustine, John Calvin, and  Martin Luther. This month, in addition to the new city catechism devotional, we are including a great companion  resource, the new city catechism for kids, as our thank you for your gift, to help gospel  and life share the hope of Christ's love with people all over the world. So request your copies today at gospelonlife.com slash give.

That's gospelonlife.com slash give. Now here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. Let me show you how that goes, all right? An experience of friendship and of lordship out of an experience of our sonship and a realization  of it. You see, the problem with the older religious tradition was no friendship, it's all externals.

That's the reason why there's no private life, that's the reason why there's no private  prayer closet, it was all externals. But the trouble with the newer spirituality is not that there's no friendship, but there's  no lordship, there's nobody to obey. I basically decide what's right and wrong for me, no friendship, no lordship, because  there's no sonship. Now, first of all, I'm going to do this kind of quickly. Number one, friendship, the purpose of prayer.

Look at the first part of the lord's prayer, what's that all about? This then is how you should pray. My father in heaven, how would be your name? Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. The first half has got nothing to do with my needs.

The first half's got nothing to do with daily bread, nothing to do with my guilt, nothing  to do with my anger toward people, nothing to do with the strength I need to face the  challenges, nothing at all. What's going on there? Well, what am I spending the first half of the prayer doing? I'm enjoying, I'm noticing, I'm rejoicing, I'm amazed by him. Well, before you get, now here's the point, before you ask for anything else, the primary  goal of prayer, or the first thing you should ask for is him.

See, when people say prayer didn't work, I always say, what do you mean prayer didn't  work? And they always tell me something they asked for that they didn't get, always. But see, the lord's prayer, basically, you know, what are you trying to do there? You're trying to make coffee in a tea maker. Jesus says, the way prayer is supposed to be built is, before you ask for anything else  first, ask for me.

See, if there's anybody here who says, prayer didn't work for me, I want to ask your question  to you persistently, day in and day out, time in and time out over and over and over and  over again. Did you say, I want you, I want you in my life, I want your reality, I want an experience  of you. Did you do that first? Was that the primary goal? No, because I'll tell you this, if you did that, prayer would not have disappointed you.

Prayer is primarily for that. You know the place in Luke where they sermon on the, pardon me, where the lord's prayer  is introduced. It's in Luke chapter 11 where Jesus tells them how to pray and use his lord's prayer. See before Luke 11, there's a story of Martha and Mary. And Martha's running all around, that's the sister who's has Jesus at the house, and  she's running all around with housework, and she's very upset and distracted and busy  and so on.

And Jesus, gently rebukes her, lovingly rebukes her, and says Martha, Martha, Mary has found  the one thing that's necessary. Now this is pretty interesting, here's Jesus Christ, Jesus the Christ, telling us. So we better open this up and look at it. There's only one thing you really need, everything else is negotiable, everything else is negotiable. Nothing else do you need.

If you have this, everything else is secondary. What is it? And when he says the one thing necessary, then he says Mary is sitting at my feet and listening  to my word, and commentators know. And they'll say Jesus Christ who was so completely steeped in the Psalms, so completely  saturated in the Psalms, could not have not, sorry, about a double negative, he could  not have not had in his mind the famous place in the Psalm, Psalm 27, verse 4, where the  Psalmist David says, one thing will I seek after, one thing only do I need to gaze on  the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple. And Jesus says, and David says, now David is a man who had a lot of problems, he was always  running for his life, he was always in crisis, he was a king, he was a general, he was in  all this stuff, and he says, there's only one thing I really need, David does not ask  for safety first, he does not ask for protection first, he does not ask for success first, with  all the stuff that was on him, he says, if my soul has a sense, a sense of the inner  sweetness and glory, if my soul sees the beauty, if I don't just know about God but I actually  taste and see his beauty, he says, well nothing else will bother me, nothing else will ever  well me, nothing else will shock me, nothing else will attract me, and I'll be able to  live a life at large.

And Jesus is saying that about Mary, and Jesus is saying that to you, and then comes the  Lord's prayer, because that's the point of it, that's the context, friendship, let's  move on, friendship is the first thing, you're not allowed because it's not built that way,  you're not allowed to go asking for anything else until you've asked for his friendship,  until you've sought like crazy for that, until you've asked for an experience of his  holiness and love, not just knowing about it but actually a sense on your heart, that's  the first point. Then secondly, Jesus says, no by the way, that's very different than the religious approach,  but secondly, unlike the new spirituality, Jesus says the second thing you get to is his  Lordship. The second purpose of prayer besides the intimacy of our Father is thy kingdom come, thy  will be done. Now here's the second thing, and this is pretty scary. Before you get to asking for the things you want, Jesus says you've got to go through this.

And that is what is the real source of your problem. So we run down to daily bread, we run down to all the other stuff, because this is what  we think. We say, I'm scared, I'm worried, I'm angry, and I know how the world needs to go. And therefore there's a torrent of words that very often comes out of our hearts toward  God when we pray. Oh Lord, you just got to do this, you've got to do this.

She's got to live, she's got to see, this has to happen, I've got to get in, this money  has to be here, I just don't see another way, and there's a torrent of words, it's babbling  by the way. That's a fair translation, we're babbling, we're just coming on. And you know what, if we just go right to daily bread, when we're done praying, we're  not going to feel less worried, we're going to feel worse. We just rehearse all the things that scare us to death. How wonderful.

And when we get down, and when we take a look at everybody who's doing bad things to us,  we're done, we're going to be more bitter, we're going to be more angry, we're going  to be more guilty. Oh Lord, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I don't know why I did this, torrent of words, babbling  and babbling and babbling. But Jesus says, here's the first, but you've missed the, you went too fast, the more primary  than asking for things, is to take yourself out of the place of God. Until you pray, the natural stance of your heart is to walk around, if you listen carefully,  you'll hear it. Your heart's always saying, my kingdom come, my will be done.

My kingdom come, my will be done. And actually, it's the source of your real trouble. It didn't come home to me till recently when I was studying Genesis 50. And in Genesis 50, Joseph, you know, remember he was betrayed by his brothers, if you  know the story, he was sold into slavery. His brothers basically tried to kill him, tried to ruin his life.

At the very end they find that he's risen up to power, he has the power to pay them  back. And when their father dies, they send a message and they said, please, don't hurt us. And Joseph gets them together and what does he say? I've forgiven you. It was a lot of work, but I've forgiven you.

No, what does he say? He says, am I in the place of God? The source of all of Joseph's forgiveness, the source of his peace, the source of his  lack of fear, when you're scared, you know why you're scared? You know why you're worried? You know why you're eating up with anxiety?

Some of you are right now. You know why? Because you're sure you know how things should go. How do you know that? How do you know how things should go?

You know you're in the place of God. You assume it. Some of you are resentful, really resentful because there are certain people who have done  certain things to you and they haven't gotten their come up in and all that. You know why you're so resentful? It's not the circumstance.

It's not them. It's because you think you know what they deserve. Do you think you know? And Joseph says, I got myself out of the place of God. That's the main reason I'm unhappy.

That's the main reason I'm scared. That's the main reason I'd be angry. I got it out. I'm out. How do I know?

You see the second part of the model is you have to experience this Lordship. You have to be willing to say, and this only happens in prayer. It will happen through the Holy Spirit if you're willing to go after it. If you see that this is really, before you get to anything else, you've got to do this. You've got to say, Lord, buy the Holy Spirit, show me the most important thing for me to know  that you're God and I'm not.

But I don't believe it. This is the reason why I can't overcome my guilt because I feel like I've got to live  up. I've got to be my own savior. This is the reason I can't overcome my anger because I know exactly what those people  deserve. This is the reason I can't overcome my worry and my anxiety, because I know how the world  has got to go.

I know. I know. Joseph says, get out. How awful. Martin Luther used to say to some of you heard me say this because Martin Luther, his friend  Philip Melanchthon, was horrible, he probably died of an ulcer, like some of you.

His name was Philip Melanchthon. Every so often, Martin Luther would come up and he would pat him on the back and would  say, let Philip cease to rule the world. In other words, Philip's problem, Martin says, is basically theological. It's not, all psychological problems are basically theological problems. And the only way to heal your heart theologically is through prayer.

Through taking a look at his heavenliness, looking at his kingship, looking at his hallowedness,  his holiness. Why is all that stuff in the beginning? Because you have to heal your heart, you have to heal your perspective and be willing  to say, you're Lord, and when that happens, then you begin that life, that big life, nothing  overwhelms you, nothing overcomes you, say. Now thirdly, how can this happen? Jesus says one reason, religious people don't have friendship in their prayer life.

Now what's interesting is the more non-religious people, they do have a private prayer life. They meditate and they're seeking and so forth, but they don't have any worship. That means they say, well, everybody has to do what you have to decide what is right and  wrong for you. You know what this means? You are not after a God who can contradict you.

You're not after a God who can say, I'm God and you're not. When you say, I don't believe in tradition, I don't believe in authority of any sort,  I have to decide what's right and wrong for me. What you've done is you have completely condemned yourself to being in the place of God for  the rest of your life. Good luck. You're underqualified for the job.

You know what it's like to be in a job that you're underqualified for? Nothing. You might have been in a job underqualified for, but nothing like this. And Jesus says now, friendship is the first lordship, you have to experience it, experience  lordship before you ask for anything, but you say, well, how can that be? How can I know him so intimately?

And how can I trust him so implicitly? Do you hear that? So the religious person says, how can I know him that intimately? You know, he tells people to say, our father. If you heard me say, even if you maybe you didn't know me at all, you didn't know anything  about me, but if you heard me or overheard me say, my Kathy, you would immediately figure  out whoever Kathy is must be wife or daughter, because you don't use words like that, unless  it's very intimate.

And if you overheard me, it would only be overheard me, because I would never say such a  thing out loud. You don't say such a thing out loud either. Why? You feel naked to talk like that. You don't use that kind of language in public for the people that matter to you like  that.

This is a language of intimacy. And Jesus says, you start out by saying, God, you're my God, father, you're my father. Well, the religious person says, how can I know that? How can I know that? I'm trying very hard to be good, and I'm hoping that God will favor me.

How can I know that? How can I treat him that intimately? And then on the other hand, the second person, the non-religious spiritual person says,  well, you say, just trust him, just say, well, you're God and hey, I'm just like,  wow, well, wait a minute here. How can you trust him like that? The answer is the doctrine of the gospel or the doctrine of adoption.

The first word is, not my king, not my lord, he's all that, my father, our father. The gospel is, the way you become a Christian is not by trying real hard through techniques,  trying real hard through good works. The doctrine of adoption is, I become a Christian when I say, father, accept me because of what  Jesus has done. And at that moment, the Bible says, we get the sonship. Now, occasionally, I've had women who say, why do you keep using the term sonship as a little  insensitive to the rest of us, and not actually not really?

Let me tell you why I hold on to it. Because in the New Testament, in those days, sonship was a legal status when you adopted somebody,  that person not only became intimate with you, but they became your heir, like that, but  only men were adopted, only men got the sonship, and yet Paul and John and all the New Testament  writers have the audacity to say that when you receive Christ as your Savior, God gives  you whoever you are, rich or poor, male or female, you get the sonship, you get the full rights. And when you know that, then you'll be able to pray. Well, somebody says, I don't know, I don't know if that's enough. How is it possible?

How is it possible that I could have this kind of confidence in God, this kind of intimacy  with God? Well, here's the answer. When Jesus Christ came to Simon Peter, before he was about to fall, he looked at Simon  and he said, Simon, Simon, Satan wanted to have you, he wanted to sift you like wheat,  but I have prayed for you. So when you turn back, when you repent, when you recover, strengthen the brothers. But Jesus said, I've prayed for you, so maybe you'll turn back, I don't know, I've prayed  for you.

Hebrews 7 says, Jesus Christ, when you become a Christian, Jesus Christ ever lives to  intercede for us. What is the word intercede? That means it just means prayer. Hebrews 7 says, Jesus Christ has reoriented his life, so there's one thing he lives for. He lives for.

We know what he's doing. He's always praying for us. He's standing before the Father, we're told, as it were. And he's constantly saying, I want this in their life, and I want that in their life,  I want good things in their life. And basically, when we pray, God says, I have all these incredible things I'm ready to  throw into your life, not because of your merits, but because of his prayer life.

Your prayer life, puny and tiniest as it is, is going to, all you got to do is just start  to pray, and you're finally going to be in a position we'd be ready to receive the  incredible things that are coming into your life because of his prayer life. Just prayer life for you. If you know his prayer life for you, if you see that prayer life for you, if you know  that you have that kind of assurance, then you'll be able to experience his friendship  and experience his worship. Somebody says, oh yeah, how? Can I just give you one little exercise?

Fifteen minutes a day, not counting Bible study, don't you dare study the Bible and  look up everything and sit down and all that, and then you pray for two minutes. That's not prayer. After you're done studying your Bible passage, take fifteen minutes, and the first thing  you need to do is listen before you speak. That's the whole point of the Lord's Prayer. Before you ask for anything, the first half is all what?

Noticing who he is, listening to who he is, hearing who he is, then you respond. That's the Lord's Prayer. The Lord's Prayer is look at this and look at this and look at this and listen to this and  listen to this. Now, here's some things I want to say to you. The whole point of the Lord's Prayer is that prayer is answering God.

It's responding to God's Word. It's not just talking. If you got an appointment with this incredibly powerful person, you wouldn't sit down and  say, I have a lot of things to tell you and just talking and talking to you and I said,  I hope you understood. I hope you heard that. My hour's up.

And that's how, no, no, no, here's what you do. Study your Bible passage and then the fifteen minutes begins. First thing you do for five, six, seven minutes at the most, ask the text, two questions. What Lord are you telling me about you and what Lord are you telling me about me? Then read the text through slowly, you've already studied it, right?

Read the text through slowly, asking those two questions and listen for his voice. And then after you've written a couple of the answers down, you see, then pray those  things. Adore him and thank him for what it's telling you about him. Confess and make petition for the things that it's telling you about you. When that fifteen minutes are up, then you can go to do other things.

You can do your prayer list. You know, bless mommy and daddy and do all that. And before that fifteen minutes, you can do your Bible study. But you know what? An awful lot of you are doing your Bible study and doing your prayer list and you're not  really praying.

You're not experiencing his friendship and you're not experiencing his worship out of  a realization of your sonship. Make sure you open up. For fifteen minutes, listen to his word in that text and then respond to it. Do it fifteen minutes a day. Do it thirty days in a row.

Go to Psalms or go to John, if you really say, well, where do I even turn? And then come back and tell me what happens. Prayer works if you go after his friendship and his worship first. He has never turned down those prayers. Let's pray.

Father, we ask that you would help us become people of prayer. There are some of us here who aren't even sure what we believe. Well, the only way you're going to find you is to pray. There are many of us here who really believe we're sure, but it's all head knowledge. There's everybody in this room needs to go back and pray.

In this room needs to find that radical interiority where there's no difference between whether  we're Christians or not Christians or we don't know what the heck we are. We pray, Father, for prayer. Your son, the greatest one who ever walked the face of the earth prayed all the time. Now we know why. He was praying for us.

Knowing he was praying for us and only if we know he was praying for us will we be able  to live a life of prayer ourselves. So help us to that end. We pray in Jesus' name, amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today's teaching from the sermon on the Mount, Tim Keller shows how Christ offers  us practical guidance for living out a compelling vision of a new kind of community shaped  by grace. In your bulletin, we come to the part of the sermon on the Mount, very famous part,  part that you come to Redeemer, you actually recite part of this every week. Matthew chapter 5, pardon me, Matthew chapter 6, verses 5 through 13. And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, or they love to pray. Standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men, I tell you the  truth they have received their reward in full.

But when you go, when you pray, go into your room, close the door, and pray to your father  who was unseen, then your father who sees what is done in secret will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like the pagans, for they think they will be  heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your father knows what you need before you ask him. This then is how you should pray. Our father in heaven, how would be your name?

Your kingdom come, you will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread, forgive us our debts as we have also, as we have forgiven  our debtors, and lead us not in temptation, but deliver us from evil. This is God's Word. Now we are going through the sermon on the Mount, and we come to the subject of prayer,  and this actually, believe it or not, is a very hot topic in our society today. In the culture in general, the last few years there has been an explosion of interest  in prayer and spirituality, in meditation, and spiritual experience.

This year, on the first Monday of the month, we get our small group leaders together,  our ministry leadership together, and I went through and talked about meditation and prayer,  and one thing that was very striking to me is just how much hunger there was there,  and amongst our own leaders for this. But the importance, actually, for Jesus of prayer, is to some degree revealed in this little  unobtrusive word that you'd probably miss at the very, very top of the page, the very  beginning of the passage in verse 5, little word, and, and. This prayer is an standalone for Jesus. It's connected. See, there are places where we've already seen in the sermon on the Mount, where Jesus  almost seems to talk like a sort of social justice radical activist, you know, there's  a place in the luke in version of the sermon on the Mount, where Jesus says, and I quote,  sell your possessions and give them to the poor, unquote.

And right before this passage, in chapter 6, Matthew 6, one to four, Jesus is talking  about our engagement with the poor and our giving of the poor and our, our intense engagement  with the worlds and the needs of the world, and then he gets to verse 5, and he says, and  when you pray, and when you pray, now look, when you're talking and you're talking about  something is, and that means it's connected. He doesn't say, well, let's change the subject. Let's get on to prayer, I don't know. In Jesus' mind, in Jesus' understanding, it is the people, I'll say it's slowly, it  is the people who are characterized by the most radical interiority that have the most  courageous, visionary engagement with the world. It is the people who are most characterized by radical interiority, an incredible inner  life of prayer that are, their life is characterized by buoyant, promiscuous generosity and engagement  with the needs of the world.

Jesus does not put these things against each other, as a matter of fact, he says, they  really can't happen without each other. If you're really praying, it drives you out. And if you're really effective out there, it's coming from within. Real interiority, now I'm using that term because there's a book, and by the way, if you're  starting to read on prayer, this should not be one of your first fifteen books. It's a little hard to read, in many ways, don't make it your sixteenth, all right?

But there's a very famous book by St. Teresa of Avila called the Interior Castle. And it's a beautiful image, it's a fascinating image. She says, when you, in your soul, actually find the king. When you actually get into the, into ultimate spiritual reality, when you actually get in  connection with the cosmic throne room, your soul, your insides become a castle of light  and of love and of radiance.

There's a radical radiance, an interior radiance that happens, and that Jesus says is the thing  you've got to have, if you're going to have this incredible life in the world. You see, Jesus sees the importance of prayer, and however, Jesus gives us a model of prayer  and spirituality, and before he gives us the model, which is in versus, you know, the  famous Lord's Prayer in verse 9 and following, he tells us two other models that we should  avoid. This is very important, very important to see, you know, Jesus is very, he's willing to  be negative in order to be positive. He says, I'm going to give you a model of spirituality, and if you understand it, and if  you receive it, and if you use it, then it's going to have this tremendous effect on  your life. You know, I've just heard tons of people say to me over the years, I've tried prayer,  but it didn't work.

Now, by the way, I have something at home that looks like a coffee maker, but it's a  tea maker, and I like it very much. But if you ever stay in my house and you try to make coffee in it, you're going to say  this coffee maker doesn't work. No, it won't, because it's not built to brew coffee, it's built to brew tea. And when people say, I've tried prayer, it didn't work. What Jesus is saying is, well, you used prayer, not the way I designed it, but you used  a false model of spirituality.

And what he does here in this paragraph in verses 5-8, he gives us two false models  of spirituality. And then he turns around verses 9 to the end, and he gives his own model. Now, let's take a look at the false models and then his own models, and we'll conclude  with some practical stuff, because people have been pressing me. So when you get to the sermon on the mount, the whole idea on the sermon on the mount  is practical. Tell me how to do this.

Don't just make me say, don't just let me walk away feeling like I ought to pray more. How? So let's look at the false models, the true model, and a couple of practical ideas here on how  to go about it. The two models, and now look, if you look carefully, you'll see that Jesus says in verse  5, when you pray, do not be like, and on verse 7, he says, and when you pray, do not be  like. He has two groups of people, and he says, when you pray, don't use these models, or you'll  be brewing coffee in a tea maker, and it won't work.

First model is religious prayer. When you pray, don't be like the hypocrites for they love to pray, standing in the synagogue  and on the street corners to be seen by men. Now, when you first read this, the first impression is, these are, these are fanatic  texts. They like to pray in the synagogue, while people did stand and pray in the synagogue. This is formal worship, but it also says, on the street corners, and right away that evokes  a picture of some guy walking along, and not here, 69th, and Park, and suddenly praying  out loud and everybody saying, well, I mean, this is New York and so.

That's not what it's trying to evoke. The street corners meant a town square, a place where the streets came together. And the connotation is this, these are people who not only go to formal worship services,  but they lead in prayer in community, civil, religious events. And this is what Jesus is getting at with this kind of prayer. Is there anything wrong with that?

Is there anything wrong with coming and praying in church or synagogue? Is there anything wrong with leading in prayer at large public events? And the answer is no, but he says, this kind of person has no interior personal prayer  life. You see, he contrasts it with the people he says, but when you pray, go in your room. These are people who have a public prayer life, but not a private prayer life.

And the reason is, the reason they see for prayer is it makes them fit in with a social  order to be seen by men. This is like, religious prayer is where prayer and worship functions as helping you fit  into your family, fit into your town, fit into your social order, fit into your people,  fit into your culture, and it puts you in the right place. It's like when the politician ends his speech by saying, and may God bless us all, he has  no prayer life, and all the people love it. And they tell the focus group people, oh, I don't really like that, but they don't have  a prayer life either. But everybody feels better.

Everyone feels better because in a sense, it baptizes the social order, or it's like  this. The average person in the world, if you say, why are you Muslim? Why are you Catholic? Why are you Presbyterian? Why are you Baptist?

And the average person says, if they're honest, because that's where I'm from. You know, I'm Italian, so I'm Catholic. I'm Arabic, so I'm Muslim. I'm from Tennessee, so I'm Baptist. I'm...

Well, yeah. In other words, well, this is my people, this is who I am, and what this means is not  look at. We're not talking about people who come and they're all dead inside. When people who's basically prayer and worship is religious, it's cultural. If you were raised in a kind of church, you're raised in a kind of service, and this is  who your people are, see?

And this is who your town is, and this is who your tribe is, and this is your family  is. You're used to it. You had a kind of an inner peace when you go, and you do feel what? You feel good, or there's certainly some sense of stability, and there's some sense of  inner peace when it... But here's what Jesus is saying.

You are not relating to God, you're relating to an environment, a social environment. You feel... You're connected to your roots, that's why you feel good, or you feel maybe even some nostalgia  or familiarity, or just a sense of being part of my tradition, but it's a connection  to the tradition, or to your family, or to your roots, or to your social order, but it's  not a connection to God. And he says the sign of that is that when you go into your private closet to pray, you've  got nothing to say. There's no passion to know him.

There's no passion to meet with him. There's no passion to want to be with him. You don't sense that at all. You pray maybe when there's trouble, but when there's no trouble, when there's nothing  forcing you, when there's no social reason, when there's no family reason, when there's  no circumstantial reason. You don't have any internal pressure to actually know him, or meet him, or see him.

And Jesus says, this is the sign that you're basically... This is just religious prayer, you're not really connected to him, you're connected to  an environment. The environment makes you feel kind of good, but you're not actually connected to him at  all. The sign is, you don't have a continual, growing, personal, secret, private prayer life. You don't know what to say.

You're bored when you get to it, just by yourself. Now, let me take the gloves off for a second before we move on here. This is Jesus' words. How do you know if you're a hypocrite? How do you know if you're a hypocrite?

Now, do you know what a hypocrite is? A hypocrite is something that somebody who's one thing on the outside and another thing  on the inside. How do you know you're a hypocrite? Well, we don't go to the place he goes. We go to sex.

We say, he says he's so moral, but he's having an affair on the side. But Jesus doesn't use sex as your test for hypocrisy. I'm not saying that's right, but that's not the test. That's not the most telling test. Well someone says, let's take a look at money.

He says, she says they're very devoted to God, but you know, they're selfishly spending  money on themselves. They don't give it to the poor. They don't give it to the church. Of course, that's bad, too. However, Jesus says, that's not the acid test.

That's the acid test that you're a hypocrite. You don't have a prayer life. There's a sermon I read years ago when I was in seminary by Jonathan Edwards. Jonathan Edwards wrote this sermon years ago, and the name of it was hypocrite's deficient  in the duty of prayer. And I had nightmares for about a month after I read that sermon because this is simply  what he says.

He says there's only one thing that you don't do for show in the Christian life. There's only one thing. It's secret prayer because everything else is for show. Everything else somebody sees. Secret prayer is the only thing you do just for God, just for Him, not for anybody else,  not even for yourself, just for Him.

It's the only thing in your life you don't do, you Christian life you don't do for show. And therefore, if you do everything else but secret prayer, all of your Christian life  is just for show. Admit it. You don't have a secret prayer life. He says that's a sign of hypocrisy.

That's a sign that the reason you pray is because of your environment, not because of  God. You're trying to... Okay, you got that enough, that's enough. You feel bad enough. Let's move on.

Jesus actually, though, very interestingly, and it's a little weird, except it's actually  easier to see today. He turns to another group. And down to verse 70 says, and when you pray, don't keep on babbling like the pagans. Now, this is a little hard to translate. First of all, the word babble is a hotbox Lagomana in all of Greek literature.

This word is used not only only here in the whole Bible, but it's only used here in  all Greek literature we know, it's no other place. And it kind of means a torrent of words, sort of a intense torrent of words, not just  many words, but kind of frantic words. And the word pagans is Jesus' word, ethne, which is often also translated nations, but  in the New Testament, it usually means the unreligious. It means the licentious. It means the immoral.

It means the non-religious. Now, why is Jesus talking about non-religious prayer? Well, to one thing that would be interesting to go to in a tangent, but I won't. One thing Jesus is saying here is there really isn't such a thing as a prayerless heart. What he's really saying is something now, you know, snotty Christians over the years  have put it this way.

There are no atheists and foxholes. That's a pretty snotty way to put it. But what he's really, what Jesus is saying is that prayer is the involuntary reflex of  the heart. No matter what you say you believe, no matter what you think about the universe, the  fact is when you feel your humanity, when you feel your vulnerability, you can't stop  yourself from praying. No matter what you say you believe, there are times in which you can't not pray, which  means that your heart knows, in spite of what you're going to like telling you, there's  a God and you need him.

The torrent comes out, no matter who you are, but that's not all. Jesus says, they think they will be here, heard, for their torrent. Robert Wuth now, I quoted him in the fall, it's a really worthwhile book to read. Where Robert Wuth now wrote a book recently called After Heaven, he's probably the leading  sociologist of religion, he teaches at Princeton University, a very prominent man, and he's  the book After Heaven was a very, very thoroughgoing sociological reflection and study of spirituality  today. He says, and this is fascinating in light of this passage, he says that the older approach  to spirituality in this country was what he called, he called it an inhabiting, an inhabiting  model, an inhabitation.

He says, the inhabiting model was, you went to sacred places out of family tradition, sounds  like what we've just talked about, the religious approach. He says, in the past, people went to sacred places, churches, synagogues, cathedrals, out  of the tradition of your people and of your family, but he says, the newer version is  sprung up in the last two years, are by people who say, I hate religious institutions. I'm spiritual, I'm not religious, everybody has to decide what is true or right for him  or herself, everyone has to decide who God is for him or herself, everybody has to decide  that for yourself. I'm putting my own religion together, but basically they say, I'm not religious, I'm spiritual  and they're really into prayer, they don't go to church, they don't want to be part  of something like that, but they're into meditation, they're into all sorts of spiritual exercises,  they're into all sorts of spiritual emphasis on touching the spiritual, but Robert Wuth  now rightly so and it's very fair of him and he's very careful man, he's a leading scholar. He says, in the end, it's not much different than religious prayer, the older version.

He calls this the seeking model of spirituality and the older one, the inhabiting model. One says, I'm here, this is my place, these are my people, that's why I pray the way I do. And the seeking model is a kind of journey who says, well, we never really arrive, we never  really have any answers, we're just always seeking. He says, one of the big problems is, whereas the former was culture driven, this one is  technique driven, new spirituality is very technique driven, you have visualization techniques,  you have relaxation techniques, extremely technique driven, but in the end, it's not really  trying to reach God either, it's trying to use this divine to get the kind of inner  peace and spirituality you feel like you need to get to your goals. You see, the old religious approach basically baptizes the social order, that's the reason  why the older religious traditions to some degree have been rejected because very often  the oppression and the injustice and the bigotry of the old social orders were baptized  by the religious tradition.

But you know what's interesting is the newer spirituality in many ways also is essentially  just a way of sort of spiritually baptizing my goals in life. For example, if you use the more modern spiritual technique, let's say you're a baseball  player and you're trying to kind of use spiritual techniques to be a better baseball, but you  just visualize yourself hitting at home run over and over and over again. You know what you're saying is, this is the world I want, and I'm going to use the divine  to get there. And Robert Wuth now is smart enough to say, that's just as superficial as the old approach,  because instead of submitting to something, instead of really being changed, you're basically  using the divine to get what you want. And Jesus says, they think they'll be heard because of their parent.

They think because I've got, I can do something, I can change things, I can create the world  the way I want it, I can visualize the world the way I want it, I can put myself in a position  where I'm reaching my goals, Jesus says, no, no, no, no. No, he says, both of these are wrong and they're bad models. My model is this. And in the Lord's Prayer, and by the way, this summer, our preaching team is going to go  through the Lord's Prayer because spirituality is so hot, and we're going to have a number  of pastors go through it. But here's what I would say is a kind of summary, which by no means a hopeful steal the thunder  either from my own serpents on the Lord's Prayer this summer or anybody else's.

But he basically says this, my model of spirituality is this, the purpose of prayer, what is prayer  really about? Is it to get things, is to get inner peace, is it to, what is prayer about? He says it's to experience the friendship of God and experience the Lordship of God out  of a realization of our sonship with God. It's an experience of friendship and an experience of Lordship out of a realization of our sonship. Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer?

Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith? For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding  of what it means to follow Christ. A great resource to start using this summer is the new city catechism devotional, God's  truth for our hearts and minds. This devotional brings the historic catechisms of the Christian Church to life, offering  a question to consider for each week of the year. In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catechesis, the rich and communal  practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers that frame the foundational beliefs  of the Christian faith.

Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer, and a brief meditation that will challenge  and inspire you. The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller,  and Kevin D. Young, as well as historical figures such as Augustine, John Calvin, and  Martin Luther. This month, in addition to the new city catechism devotional, we are including a great companion  resource, the new city catechism for kids, as our thank you for your gift, to help gospel  and life share the hope of Christ's love with people all over the world. So request your copies today at gospelonlife.com slash give.

That's gospelonlife.com slash give. Now here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. Let me show you how that goes, all right? An experience of friendship and of lordship out of an experience of our sonship and a realization  of it. You see, the problem with the older religious tradition was no friendship, it's all externals.

That's the reason why there's no private life, that's the reason why there's no private  prayer closet, it was all externals. But the trouble with the newer spirituality is not that there's no friendship, but there's  no lordship, there's nobody to obey. I basically decide what's right and wrong for me, no friendship, no lordship, because  there's no sonship. Now, first of all, I'm going to do this kind of quickly. Number one, friendship, the purpose of prayer.

Look at the first part of the lord's prayer, what's that all about? This then is how you should pray. My father in heaven, how would be your name? Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. The first half has got nothing to do with my needs.

The first half's got nothing to do with daily bread, nothing to do with my guilt, nothing  to do with my anger toward people, nothing to do with the strength I need to face the  challenges, nothing at all. What's going on there? Well, what am I spending the first half of the prayer doing? I'm enjoying, I'm noticing, I'm rejoicing, I'm amazed by him. Well, before you get, now here's the point, before you ask for anything else, the primary  goal of prayer, or the first thing you should ask for is him.

See, when people say prayer didn't work, I always say, what do you mean prayer didn't  work? And they always tell me something they asked for that they didn't get, always. But see, the lord's prayer, basically, you know, what are you trying to do there? You're trying to make coffee in a tea maker. Jesus says, the way prayer is supposed to be built is, before you ask for anything else  first, ask for me.

See, if there's anybody here who says, prayer didn't work for me, I want to ask your question  to you persistently, day in and day out, time in and time out over and over and over and  over again. Did you say, I want you, I want you in my life, I want your reality, I want an experience  of you. Did you do that first? Was that the primary goal? No, because I'll tell you this, if you did that, prayer would not have disappointed you.

Prayer is primarily for that. You know the place in Luke where they sermon on the, pardon me, where the lord's prayer  is introduced. It's in Luke chapter 11 where Jesus tells them how to pray and use his lord's prayer. See before Luke 11, there's a story of Martha and Mary. And Martha's running all around, that's the sister who's has Jesus at the house, and  she's running all around with housework, and she's very upset and distracted and busy  and so on.

And Jesus, gently rebukes her, lovingly rebukes her, and says Martha, Martha, Mary has found  the one thing that's necessary. Now this is pretty interesting, here's Jesus Christ, Jesus the Christ, telling us. So we better open this up and look at it. There's only one thing you really need, everything else is negotiable, everything else is negotiable. Nothing else do you need.

If you have this, everything else is secondary. What is it? And when he says the one thing necessary, then he says Mary is sitting at my feet and listening  to my word, and commentators know. And they'll say Jesus Christ who was so completely steeped in the Psalms, so completely  saturated in the Psalms, could not have not, sorry, about a double negative, he could  not have not had in his mind the famous place in the Psalm, Psalm 27, verse 4, where the  Psalmist David says, one thing will I seek after, one thing only do I need to gaze on  the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple. And Jesus says, and David says, now David is a man who had a lot of problems, he was always  running for his life, he was always in crisis, he was a king, he was a general, he was in  all this stuff, and he says, there's only one thing I really need, David does not ask  for safety first, he does not ask for protection first, he does not ask for success first, with  all the stuff that was on him, he says, if my soul has a sense, a sense of the inner  sweetness and glory, if my soul sees the beauty, if I don't just know about God but I actually  taste and see his beauty, he says, well nothing else will bother me, nothing else will ever  well me, nothing else will shock me, nothing else will attract me, and I'll be able to  live a life at large.

And Jesus is saying that about Mary, and Jesus is saying that to you, and then comes the  Lord's prayer, because that's the point of it, that's the context, friendship, let's  move on, friendship is the first thing, you're not allowed because it's not built that way,  you're not allowed to go asking for anything else until you've asked for his friendship,  until you've sought like crazy for that, until you've asked for an experience of his  holiness and love, not just knowing about it but actually a sense on your heart, that's  the first point. Then secondly, Jesus says, no by the way, that's very different than the religious approach,  but secondly, unlike the new spirituality, Jesus says the second thing you get to is his  Lordship. The second purpose of prayer besides the intimacy of our Father is thy kingdom come, thy  will be done. Now here's the second thing, and this is pretty scary. Before you get to asking for the things you want, Jesus says you've got to go through this.

And that is what is the real source of your problem. So we run down to daily bread, we run down to all the other stuff, because this is what  we think. We say, I'm scared, I'm worried, I'm angry, and I know how the world needs to go. And therefore there's a torrent of words that very often comes out of our hearts toward  God when we pray. Oh Lord, you just got to do this, you've got to do this.

She's got to live, she's got to see, this has to happen, I've got to get in, this money  has to be here, I just don't see another way, and there's a torrent of words, it's babbling  by the way. That's a fair translation, we're babbling, we're just coming on. And you know what, if we just go right to daily bread, when we're done praying, we're  not going to feel less worried, we're going to feel worse. We just rehearse all the things that scare us to death. How wonderful.

And when we get down, and when we take a look at everybody who's doing bad things to us,  we're done, we're going to be more bitter, we're going to be more angry, we're going  to be more guilty. Oh Lord, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I don't know why I did this, torrent of words, babbling  and babbling and babbling. But Jesus says, here's the first, but you've missed the, you went too fast, the more primary  than asking for things, is to take yourself out of the place of God. Until you pray, the natural stance of your heart is to walk around, if you listen carefully,  you'll hear it. Your heart's always saying, my kingdom come, my will be done.

My kingdom come, my will be done. And actually, it's the source of your real trouble. It didn't come home to me till recently when I was studying Genesis 50. And in Genesis 50, Joseph, you know, remember he was betrayed by his brothers, if you  know the story, he was sold into slavery. His brothers basically tried to kill him, tried to ruin his life.

At the very end they find that he's risen up to power, he has the power to pay them  back. And when their father dies, they send a message and they said, please, don't hurt us. And Joseph gets them together and what does he say? I've forgiven you. It was a lot of work, but I've forgiven you.

No, what does he say? He says, am I in the place of God? The source of all of Joseph's forgiveness, the source of his peace, the source of his  lack of fear, when you're scared, you know why you're scared? You know why you're worried? You know why you're eating up with anxiety?

Some of you are right now. You know why? Because you're sure you know how things should go. How do you know that? How do you know how things should go?

You know you're in the place of God. You assume it. Some of you are resentful, really resentful because there are certain people who have done  certain things to you and they haven't gotten their come up in and all that. You know why you're so resentful? It's not the circumstance.

It's not them. It's because you think you know what they deserve. Do you think you know? And Joseph says, I got myself out of the place of God. That's the main reason I'm unhappy.

That's the main reason I'm scared. That's the main reason I'd be angry. I got it out. I'm out. How do I know?

You see the second part of the model is you have to experience this Lordship. You have to be willing to say, and this only happens in prayer. It will happen through the Holy Spirit if you're willing to go after it. If you see that this is really, before you get to anything else, you've got to do this. You've got to say, Lord, buy the Holy Spirit, show me the most important thing for me to know  that you're God and I'm not.

But I don't believe it. This is the reason why I can't overcome my guilt because I feel like I've got to live  up. I've got to be my own savior. This is the reason I can't overcome my anger because I know exactly what those people  deserve. This is the reason I can't overcome my worry and my anxiety, because I know how the world  has got to go.

I know. I know. Joseph says, get out. How awful. Martin Luther used to say to some of you heard me say this because Martin Luther, his friend  Philip Melanchthon, was horrible, he probably died of an ulcer, like some of you.

His name was Philip Melanchthon. Every so often, Martin Luther would come up and he would pat him on the back and would  say, let Philip cease to rule the world. In other words, Philip's problem, Martin says, is basically theological. It's not, all psychological problems are basically theological problems. And the only way to heal your heart theologically is through prayer.

Through taking a look at his heavenliness, looking at his kingship, looking at his hallowedness,  his holiness. Why is all that stuff in the beginning? Because you have to heal your heart, you have to heal your perspective and be willing  to say, you're Lord, and when that happens, then you begin that life, that big life, nothing  overwhelms you, nothing overcomes you, say. Now thirdly, how can this happen? Jesus says one reason, religious people don't have friendship in their prayer life.

Now what's interesting is the more non-religious people, they do have a private prayer life. They meditate and they're seeking and so forth, but they don't have any worship. That means they say, well, everybody has to do what you have to decide what is right and  wrong for you. You know what this means? You are not after a God who can contradict you.

You're not after a God who can say, I'm God and you're not. When you say, I don't believe in tradition, I don't believe in authority of any sort,  I have to decide what's right and wrong for me. What you've done is you have completely condemned yourself to being in the place of God for  the rest of your life. Good luck. You're underqualified for the job.

You know what it's like to be in a job that you're underqualified for? Nothing. You might have been in a job underqualified for, but nothing like this. And Jesus says now, friendship is the first lordship, you have to experience it, experience  lordship before you ask for anything, but you say, well, how can that be? How can I know him so intimately?

And how can I trust him so implicitly? Do you hear that? So the religious person says, how can I know him that intimately? You know, he tells people to say, our father. If you heard me say, even if you maybe you didn't know me at all, you didn't know anything  about me, but if you heard me or overheard me say, my Kathy, you would immediately figure  out whoever Kathy is must be wife or daughter, because you don't use words like that, unless  it's very intimate.

And if you overheard me, it would only be overheard me, because I would never say such a  thing out loud. You don't say such a thing out loud either. Why? You feel naked to talk like that. You don't use that kind of language in public for the people that matter to you like  that.

This is a language of intimacy. And Jesus says, you start out by saying, God, you're my God, father, you're my father. Well, the religious person says, how can I know that? How can I know that? I'm trying very hard to be good, and I'm hoping that God will favor me.

How can I know that? How can I treat him that intimately? And then on the other hand, the second person, the non-religious spiritual person says,  well, you say, just trust him, just say, well, you're God and hey, I'm just like,  wow, well, wait a minute here. How can you trust him like that? The answer is the doctrine of the gospel or the doctrine of adoption.

The first word is, not my king, not my lord, he's all that, my father, our father. The gospel is, the way you become a Christian is not by trying real hard through techniques,  trying real hard through good works. The doctrine of adoption is, I become a Christian when I say, father, accept me because of what  Jesus has done. And at that moment, the Bible says, we get the sonship. Now, occasionally, I've had women who say, why do you keep using the term sonship as a little  insensitive to the rest of us, and not actually not really?

Let me tell you why I hold on to it. Because in the New Testament, in those days, sonship was a legal status when you adopted somebody,  that person not only became intimate with you, but they became your heir, like that, but  only men were adopted, only men got the sonship, and yet Paul and John and all the New Testament  writers have the audacity to say that when you receive Christ as your Savior, God gives  you whoever you are, rich or poor, male or female, you get the sonship, you get the full rights. And when you know that, then you'll be able to pray. Well, somebody says, I don't know, I don't know if that's enough. How is it possible?

How is it possible that I could have this kind of confidence in God, this kind of intimacy  with God? Well, here's the answer. When Jesus Christ came to Simon Peter, before he was about to fall, he looked at Simon  and he said, Simon, Simon, Satan wanted to have you, he wanted to sift you like wheat,  but I have prayed for you. So when you turn back, when you repent, when you recover, strengthen the brothers. But Jesus said, I've prayed for you, so maybe you'll turn back, I don't know, I've prayed  for you.

Hebrews 7 says, Jesus Christ, when you become a Christian, Jesus Christ ever lives to  intercede for us. What is the word intercede? That means it just means prayer. Hebrews 7 says, Jesus Christ has reoriented his life, so there's one thing he lives for. He lives for.

We know what he's doing. He's always praying for us. He's standing before the Father, we're told, as it were. And he's constantly saying, I want this in their life, and I want that in their life,  I want good things in their life. And basically, when we pray, God says, I have all these incredible things I'm ready to  throw into your life, not because of your merits, but because of his prayer life.

Your prayer life, puny and tiniest as it is, is going to, all you got to do is just start  to pray, and you're finally going to be in a position we'd be ready to receive the  incredible things that are coming into your life because of his prayer life. Just prayer life for you. If you know his prayer life for you, if you see that prayer life for you, if you know  that you have that kind of assurance, then you'll be able to experience his friendship  and experience his worship. Somebody says, oh yeah, how? Can I just give you one little exercise?

Fifteen minutes a day, not counting Bible study, don't you dare study the Bible and  look up everything and sit down and all that, and then you pray for two minutes. That's not prayer. After you're done studying your Bible passage, take fifteen minutes, and the first thing  you need to do is listen before you speak. That's the whole point of the Lord's Prayer. Before you ask for anything, the first half is all what?

Noticing who he is, listening to who he is, hearing who he is, then you respond. That's the Lord's Prayer. The Lord's Prayer is look at this and look at this and look at this and listen to this and  listen to this. Now, here's some things I want to say to you. The whole point of the Lord's Prayer is that prayer is answering God.

It's responding to God's Word. It's not just talking. If you got an appointment with this incredibly powerful person, you wouldn't sit down and  say, I have a lot of things to tell you and just talking and talking to you and I said,  I hope you understood. I hope you heard that. My hour's up.

And that's how, no, no, no, here's what you do. Study your Bible passage and then the fifteen minutes begins. First thing you do for five, six, seven minutes at the most, ask the text, two questions. What Lord are you telling me about you and what Lord are you telling me about me? Then read the text through slowly, you've already studied it, right?

Read the text through slowly, asking those two questions and listen for his voice. And then after you've written a couple of the answers down, you see, then pray those  things. Adore him and thank him for what it's telling you about him. Confess and make petition for the things that it's telling you about you. When that fifteen minutes are up, then you can go to do other things.

You can do your prayer list. You know, bless mommy and daddy and do all that. And before that fifteen minutes, you can do your Bible study. But you know what? An awful lot of you are doing your Bible study and doing your prayer list and you're not  really praying.

You're not experiencing his friendship and you're not experiencing his worship out of  a realization of your sonship. Make sure you open up. For fifteen minutes, listen to his word in that text and then respond to it. Do it fifteen minutes a day. Do it thirty days in a row.

Go to Psalms or go to John, if you really say, well, where do I even turn? And then come back and tell me what happens. Prayer works if you go after his friendship and his worship first. He has never turned down those prayers. Let's pray.

Father, we ask that you would help us become people of prayer. There are some of us here who aren't even sure what we believe. Well, the only way you're going to find you is to pray. There are many of us here who really believe we're sure, but it's all head knowledge. There's everybody in this room needs to go back and pray.

In this room needs to find that radical interiority where there's no difference between whether  we're Christians or not Christians or we don't know what the heck we are. We pray, Father, for prayer. Your son, the greatest one who ever walked the face of the earth prayed all the time. Now we know why. He was praying for us.

Knowing he was praying for us and only if we know he was praying for us will we be able  to live a life of prayer ourselves. So help us to that end. We pray in Jesus' name, amen.

今天我们要从《登山宝训》的讲道来看，提姆·凯勒将指出：基督如何为我们提供切实可行的指引，帮助我们活出一种令人向往的新型群体的异象——一个由恩典塑造的群体。在你们的周报里，我们来到《登山宝训》中非常著名的一段；如果你来救赎主教会（Redeemer），你实际上每周都会背诵其中一部分。马太福音第5章——抱歉，是马太福音第6章，第5节到第13节：“你们祷告的时候，不可像那假冒为善的人，因为他们爱站在会堂里和十字路口上祷告，为要叫人看见。我实在告诉你们，他们已经得了他们的赏赐。

“你祷告的时候，要进你的内屋，关上门，祷告你在暗中的父；你父在暗中察看，必然报答你。你们祷告，不可像外邦人那样唠唠叨叨，因为他们以为话多了必蒙垂听。你们不可效法他们，因为你们没有祈求以先，你们所需用的，你们的父早已知道了。所以你们要这样祷告：我们在天上的父，愿你的名被尊为圣。

愿你的国降临；愿你的旨意行在地上，如同行在天上。我们日用的饮食，今日赐给我们；免我们的债，如同我们也免了人的债；不叫我们遇见试探，救我们脱离凶恶。这是神的话语。

现在我们正在逐段查考《登山宝训》，今天我们来到祷告这个主题；而且，信不信由你，这在当今社会其实是一个非常热门的话题。

在整个文化层面，过去几年里，人们对祷告与属灵性的兴趣，对默想，以及对属灵经历的兴趣，都出现了爆炸性的增长。

今年，我们在每个月的第一个周一把小组长们召集在一起，也把各个事工的带领同工聚在一起。我带着大家一起梳理、讲解了默想和祷告。有一件事让我非常触动：大家对这件事的饥渴何等强烈——就连在我们自己的带领同工当中也是如此。

不过，耶稣对祷告之重要性的某种揭示，其实就藏在一个小小的、不起眼的词里——你很可能会在页面最顶端、经文一开始的第五节那里就把它忽略掉：一个小词，“并且……并且”（and, and）。对耶稣来说，这段关于祷告的教导并不是一个孤立的段落；它是连在一起的。你看，在《登山宝训》里，我们已经看到过一些地方，耶稣几乎像是在以一种社会公义的激进活动家的口吻说话。比如在路加版本的《登山宝训》里，耶稣说——我引用——“卖掉你们的财物，周济穷人。”

而在这一段之前，也就是《马太福音》第6章1到4节，耶稣正在谈我们如何与穷人相连、如何施舍给穷人，如何与这个世界以及世界的需要有一种强烈、深切的投入。然后他到了第5节，说：“并且，当你们祷告的时候……并且，当你们祷告的时候……”你看，当你在讲一件事、又说“并且”，那就表示它们是相连的。他并没有说：“好吧，我们换个话题。我们来谈祷告吧。”没有。在耶稣的心意里、在耶稣的理解中，是那些——我慢慢说——是那些以内在生命最为彻底、最为激进来定义的人，才会以最勇敢、最有异象的方式投入世界。

也就是说，最被“激进的内在性”所刻画的人——拥有一种惊人的祷告内在生活的人——他们的生活反而会呈现出一种轻盈的、慷慨到近乎“不设防”的施与，并且积极参与回应世界的需要。

耶稣并不把这两件事彼此对立起来；事实上，他说：没有彼此，另一件也无法真正发生。如果你真的在祷告，它会把你推向外面；如果你真的在外面结出果效，那一定是从里面涌出来的。

“真实的内在性”（interiority）——我之所以用这个词，是因为有一本书……顺便说一句，如果你刚开始读关于祷告的书，这本不该成为你前十五本读物之一。它在很多方面有点难读；别把它当作你的第十六本也行，好吗？

不过有一本非常著名的书，是阿维拉的圣德兰（St. Teresa of Avila）写的，叫《内心的城堡》（Interior Castle）。那是一个美丽的意象，也是一个令人着迷的意象。她说，当你在自己的灵魂深处真正找到了君王——当你真的进入终极的属灵真实，当你真的与那宇宙的宝座厅建立了联结——你的灵魂、你的内里，就会成为一座充满光、充满爱、充满辉煌的城堡。

会发生一种彻底的光辉，一种内在的光辉；而耶稣说，这正是你必须拥有的东西，如果你要在这世上活出那种非同寻常的生命。你看，耶稣看见祷告的重要；然而，耶稣在给我们祷告与属灵生活的范式之前——也就是在他给出那个范式（你知道的，就是第9节开始那段著名的主祷文）之前——他先告诉我们两种我们应该避免的范式。这非常重要，非常重要要看见这一点：你知道，耶稣非常……他为了能肯定地建造，也愿意先作否定的指出。他说：我要给你一个属灵生活的范式；如果你明白它，如果你领受它，如果你运用它，那么它将对你的生命产生极大的影响。你知道，这些年来我听过无数人对我说：“我试过祷告，但没有用。”

顺便说一句，我家里有一样东西，看起来像咖啡机，但其实是煮茶机，我很喜欢它。不过如果你在我家住，想用它来煮咖啡，你一定会说：“这咖啡机不管用。”不，它确实不会管用，因为它不是为煮咖啡而造的，它是为煮茶而造的。人们说：“我试过祷告，不管用。”耶稣所说的是：嗯，你使用祷告的方式，不是照着我设计它的方式；你使用的是一种错误的属灵范式。

所以在这里，在第5到第8节这一段里，他给了我们两种错误的属灵范式。然后他在第9节一直到末了，转过来给出他自己的范式。现在，让我们先来看看这些错误的范式，再来看他自己的范式；最后我们会用一些实际的内容作结，因为有人一直在催我。你看，当你读到登山宝训时，登山宝训的整个意思就是实践性的：告诉我该怎么做。

别只是让我说一句“是啊”，别只是让我带着“我应该多祷告”的感觉转身走开。那到底该怎么做呢？所以我们来看看错误的模式、正确的模式，以及几条关于如何开始操练的实际建议。两个模式——你若仔细看，会发现耶稣在第5节说：“你们祷告的时候，不可像……”；在第7节又说：“你们祷告的时候，不可像……”他提到两类人，并且说：你祷告时别照他们的模式来，否则就像用泡茶机去煮咖啡——怎么弄都不会对劲。

第一种模式是“宗教式祷告”。“你们祷告的时候，不可像那假冒为善的人，因为他们爱站在会堂里和十字路口上祷告，故意叫人看见。”你第一次读这段话，可能会觉得这些人简直是祷告狂热者。他们喜欢在会堂里祷告——而当时人在会堂里确实是站着祷告的；那是正式的敬拜。但经文也说“在十字路口上”，这一下就让人联想到这样一幅画面：某个人走在路上，到了什么“第69街和公园大道”之类的路口，突然当众大声祷告，然后大家心想：呃，这是纽约嘛……

但这里并不是要唤起这种画面。所谓“十字路口”指的是城镇的广场——街道汇聚之处。它所带出的含义是：这类人不仅参加正式的敬拜聚会，而且还会在社区的、民间的、宗教性的公共活动中带领大家祷告。耶稣针对的正是这种祷告方式。那这样做有什么不对吗？

在教会或会堂里祷告有什么不对吗？在大型公共活动中带领祷告有什么不对吗？答案是：没有错。但耶稣说，这类人没有内在的、个人的祷告生活。你看，他把他们与另一类人对比：“但你祷告的时候，要进你的内室……”这些人有公开的祷告生活，却没有私下的祷告生活。

原因就在这里：他们之所以觉得需要祷告，是因为祷告能让他们在某种社会秩序里“合群”，让人看见、得到人的认可。就好像那种宗教式的祷告：祷告和敬拜的功能，是帮助你融入你的家庭，融入你的城镇，融入你的社会结构，融入你的族群，融入你的文化，让你站在“正确的位置”上。就像政客在演讲结尾说“愿上帝赐福我们众人”——他根本没有祷告生活，但所有人都很喜欢。然后他们对焦点小组的人说：“哦，我其实不太喜欢那一段。”可他们自己也没有祷告生活。但不管怎样，大家都觉得舒服了。

大家觉得舒服，是因为在某种意义上，这等于给既有的社会秩序施了洗，或者说，是这么一回事：世界上绝大多数人，如果你问他：“你为什么是穆斯林？你为什么是天主教徒？你为什么是长老会的？你为什么是浸信会的？”

一般人如果诚实，会说：因为我就是从那里来的。你知道，我是意大利人，所以我就是天主教；我是阿拉伯人，所以我就是穆斯林；我来自田纳西，所以我就是浸信会；我……

嗯，对。换句话说，“这是我的人，这是我是谁。”而这意味着什么？注意：我们不是在谈那些来聚会却内里都死掉的人。那些祷告和敬拜基本上是“宗教式”的人，其实是“文化式”的。如果你在某一种教会环境里长大、在某一种礼拜形式里长大，这就是你的人是谁，明白吗？

这也是你的城镇是什么样，这也是你的部落是什么样，这也是你的家庭是什么样。你已经习惯了。你去到那里，会有一种内在的平安；而且你确实会感觉到什么？你会感觉良好，或者至少有一种稳定感；当它发生时，会有某种内在的平安……但耶稣在说的是：

你并不是在与上帝发生关系，你是在与一种环境——一种社会环境——发生关系。你觉得……你与自己的根相连，所以你觉得好；或者你甚至会感到某种怀旧、熟悉，或者只是觉得“我是我这个传统的一部分”。但那是与传统的连接，或与家庭的连接，或与根源的连接，或与社会秩序的连接，却不是与上帝的连接。他说，这一点的标志就是：当你进到自己的内室里私下祷告时，你无话可说。你没有想认识祂的热切渴望。

你没有那种渴望去见他的热情。你没有那种想要与他同在的热情。你完全感受不到这一点。你也许在遇到麻烦的时候才祷告；可是一旦没有麻烦、没有任何事逼着你、没有社交上的理由、没有家庭上的理由、没有环境上的理由时，你心里就没有任何内在的催促，去真正认识他、去见他、去看见他。

耶稣说：这就是一个记号，表明你基本上……这只是一种宗教性的祷告；你并没有真的与他相连，你只是与某种“环境”相连。那个环境会让你感觉还不错，但你其实根本没有与他相连。其标志就是：你没有一种持续的、不断成长的、个人的、隐秘的、私下的祷告生活。你甚至不知道该说什么。

当你真的开始祷告、只剩你一个人的时候，你会觉得无聊。现在，在我们继续往下之前，让我先把话说得更直白一点，把“手套摘下来”讲一讲。这是耶稣的话。你怎么知道自己是不是一个假冒为善的人？你怎么知道自己是不是一个假冒为善的人？

你知道“假冒为善”是什么意思吗？假冒为善，就是一个人在外面是一副样子，在里面却是另一个样子。你怎么知道你是假冒为善？通常我们不会去耶稣指的那个地方找答案，我们会去看性方面的问题。

我们会说：他不是一直说自己很有道德吗？可他私底下还在搞婚外情。但耶稣并没有用性来作为检验你是否假冒为善的标准。我不是说那样就对，但那并不是这个测试；那不是最能说明问题的测试。有人会说：那就看看钱吧。

他（她）不是说自己很敬虔、很委身于神吗？可是你看，他们却自私地把钱花在自己身上；他们不把钱给穷人，不奉献给教会。当然，那也很糟糕。然而耶稣说：那还不是“试金石”。

耶稣说：这才是检验你是否假冒为善的“试金石”。你没有祷告生活。我在神学院的时候读过一篇多年前的讲道，是乔纳森·爱德华兹写的。他在很多年前写了这篇讲道，题目叫《假冒为善的人在祷告责任上的缺失》（Hypocrites Deficient in the Duty of Prayer）。我读完那篇讲道之后，大概有一个月都在做噩梦，因为他基本上就是在说这件事。

他说，在基督徒的生活里，只有一件事不是做给人看的。只有这一件。那就是隐秘的祷告，因为其他一切都是做给人看的。其他一切总会有人看见。隐秘祷告是你唯一只为上帝而做的事，只为祂，不为任何别人，甚至也不是为你自己，只为祂。

这是你生命中唯一一件你不会为了展示而去做的事——你基督徒生活里唯一不为“作秀”而做的事。因此，如果你其他事都做了，却没有隐秘祷告，那么你的整个基督徒生活就都只是做给人看的。承认吧。你没有隐秘的祷告生活。他说，这就是虚伪的标志。

这表明你之所以祷告，是因为你的环境，而不是因为上帝。你是在想要……好了，你明白了，够了，够了。你已经够难受了。我们继续。

不过，耶稣接下来其实很有意思，而且有点怪——但在今天反而更容易看明白。他转向另一群人。往下到第7节说：“你们祷告的时候，不可像外邦人那样喋喋不休。”这句话其实有点难翻。

首先，“喋喋不休”这个词，在现存的希腊文学中是一个罕见词（hapax legomenon）。这个词不仅在整本圣经里只在这里出现一次，而且在我们所知道的全部希腊文学中也只在这里出现，没有别的地方。它大概的意思是“词语的洪流”，一种强烈的词语奔涌——不只是“很多话”，而是有点慌乱、急促的一串话。

而“外邦人”是耶稣用的词 ethne，这个词也常被译作“列国”，但在新约里通常指不敬虔的人，指放荡的人，指不道德的人。

就是指那些不宗教的人。那耶稣为什么要谈论“不宗教的人的祷告”呢？有一件事如果展开讲会很有意思，不过我不岔开。耶稣在这里说的一点是：其实并不存在所谓“没有祷告的心”。他真正要说的是一件事——你知道，许多年来，一些自以为是的基督徒是这样讲的。

战壕里没有无神论者。这话说得相当刻薄、带点傲慢。但他真正的意思——耶稣在这里所说的是：祷告是人心不由自主的反射动作。无论你口头上说自己信什么，无论你对宇宙怎么想，事实是：当你真实感到自己作为人的处境，当你感到自己的脆弱与无助时，你就无法阻止自己祷告。无论你声称自己相信什么，总有一些时刻你“不能不祷告”。这就意味着：你的心知道——尽管你可能喜欢对自己说相反的话——有一位上帝，而你需要他。

不管你是谁，那股洪流都会喷涌而出；但这还不是全部。耶稣说：他们以为自己会因着那股洪流而被垂听。罗伯特·伍斯诺（Robert Wuthnow）——我在秋天曾引用过他——他有一本非常值得一读的书。罗伯特·伍斯诺最近写了一本书，名叫《天国之后》（After Heaven）。他大概是当今宗教社会学领域的领军人物，在普林斯顿大学任教，是一位非常有影响力的人物。《天国之后》这本书对当代的属灵追求作了非常全面、深入的社会学反思与研究。他说——结合这段经文来看，尤其耐人寻味——他说，这个国家过去较为传统的属灵观，是他所称的“栖居式”模式（an inhabiting model），一种“栖居/居住式”的属灵。

他说，“栖居模式”（inhabiting model）是：你出于家族传统而去到神圣的场所——听起来就像我们刚才谈到的那种“宗教式”的途径。他说，以前人们去神圣的地方——教堂、会堂、大教堂——是出于你所属的民族传统和家庭传统；但他说，更新的一种版本在过去两年里兴起，是由一些人推动的，他们说：我讨厌宗教机构。我是属灵的，我不是宗教的；每个人都必须自己决定什么对他或她来说是真或对；每个人都必须自己决定上帝对他或她是谁；这些都得你自己来决定。我在把自己的宗教拼装起来。但基本上他们会说：我不是宗教的，我是属灵的——他们非常热衷于祷告；他们不去教会，也不想成为那种组织的一部分；但他们热衷于默想，热衷于各种属灵操练，强调“触摸属灵”的各样属灵重点。不过罗伯特·伍斯诺（Robert Wuthnow）说得很对——这评价很公平——而且他非常谨慎，他是顶尖学者。他说，到头来，这和宗教祷告、也就是旧版本，并没有太大区别。

他把这种称为“寻求模式”（seeking model）的属灵性，把旧的称为“栖居模式”。一种说：我就在这里，这是我的地方，这是我的人，所以我就这样祷告。寻求模式则像是一段旅程：我们从来没有真正到达，我们从来没有真正有答案，我们只是一直在寻找。他说，其中一个大问题是：前一种是由文化驱动的，而这一种是由技术驱动的——新的属灵性非常“技术驱动”：有观想（visualization）技巧，有放松技巧，极其技术化。但到最后，它也并不是真的在寻求与上帝相遇，而是想利用这种“神圣的力量”，去得到一种内在的平安和你觉得自己需要的那种属灵感，好让你达成自己的目标。

你看，旧的宗教途径基本上是在给社会秩序“施洗”，也就是为之赋予神圣的正当性；这也是为什么旧的宗教传统在某种程度上会被拒绝，因为很多时候，旧社会秩序里的压迫、不公与偏见，都被宗教传统“施洗”并加以认可。

但你知道有意思的是，许多方面看来，较新的那种“灵性”本质上也不过是一种方式：把我人生中的目标用属灵的语言“施洗”一下而已。比如说，如果你用更现代的属灵技巧——假设你是个棒球选手，你想借助一些属灵技巧让自己打球更好——你所做的就是一遍又一遍地想象自己打出全垒打。你明白你在说什么吗？你在说：这是我想要的世界，而我会利用神圣的力量把我带到那里。罗伯特·伍斯诺（Robert Wuthnow）够聪明，他会说：这和旧的那一套同样肤浅；因为你不是在顺服某个对象，也不是真正被改变，你基本上只是利用神圣来得到你想要的东西。而耶稣说，他们以为自己会蒙垂听，是因为他们的“父母”。

他们以为：因为我有——我能做点什么，我能改变事情，我能把世界塑造成我想要的样子，我能把我想要的世界在脑海里可视化，我能让自己处在一个不断达成目标的位置上。耶稣说：不，不，不，不。不。他说：这两种都是错的，都是坏的模型。我的模型是这样的。

在《主祷文》里——顺便说一句，这个夏天，我们的讲道团队会讲《主祷文》，因为“灵性”这个话题太热了，我们会安排好几位牧师来讲。但我在这里要说的，只能算是一个概要，绝不是要在这个夏天我自己关于《主祷文》的讲道、或任何其他人的讲道之前“抢先把梗讲完”。

但他基本上是这样说的：我的灵修模型是这样的——祷告的目的是什么？祷告到底是为了什么？是为了得着东西吗？是为了得着内心的平安吗？还是为了——祷告到底是为了什么？他说：是为了经历与神的友谊，并且经历神的主权，而这一切都出自我们意识到自己是神的儿子（儿女）。这是在我们认识到自己是儿子（儿女）的基础上，对友谊的经历、对主权的经历。这个夏天，你在寻找让信心成长的方法吗？

或者你希望帮助初信者或孩子抓住基督信仰的核心吗？对我们许多人来说，夏季的几个月往往会给我们更多时间去加深信心，并更深入地理解跟随基督意味着什么。这个夏天一个很好的入门资源，是《新城要理问答》灵修书——《上帝的真理，给我们的心与我们的思想》。这本灵修把基督教会历史上的要理问答“活”了起来，为一年中的每一周提供一个值得思考的问题。在序言中，提姆·凯勒（Tim Keller）阐明了开展要理教育（catechesis）的理由——这是一种丰盛且群体性的操练：学习并背诵问答，以此框定基督信仰的根基性信念。

每一周都包含一段经文、一篇祷告，以及一则简短默想，会向你发出挑战并激励你。书中所收录的释义文章出自当代牧者，例如约翰·派博（John Piper）、提姆·凯勒（Tim Keller）和凯文·D·杨（Kevin D. Young），也包括历史人物，例如奥古斯丁（Augustine）、约翰·加尔文（John Calvin）和马丁·路德（Martin Luther）。本月，除了《新城要理问答》灵修书之外，我们还将一份极好的配套资源——《儿童新城要理问答》——作为对你奉献礼物的感谢一并赠送，帮助“福音与生命”（Gospel in Life）把基督之爱的盼望分享给世界各地的人。所以今天就到 gospelonlife.com/give 申请你的那几本吧。

让我给你们看看这是怎么回事，好吗？从我们“儿子的身份”（sonship）的经历、以及对这一身份的领悟之中，生发出“朋友关系”（friendship）与“主权/主宰关系”（lordship）的经历。你看，旧的宗教传统的问题在于没有朋友关系——全都是外在形式。

这就是为什么没有私人生活，这就是为什么没有“私下祷告的密室”（private prayer closet）——一切都只是外在形式。但新的灵性追求的问题不在于没有朋友关系，而在于没有主权：没有一个需要顺服的对象。我基本上自己决定对我而言什么是对、什么是错——没有朋友关系，没有主权，因为没有儿子的身份。

现在，首先，我要比较快地讲。第一点，朋友关系——祷告的目的。

看看主祷文的前半部分，是在讲什么？“所以你们祷告要这样说：我们在天上的父，愿人都尊你的名为圣；愿你的国降临；愿你的旨意行在地上，如同行在天上。”前半段完全没有提到我的需要。

前半段跟日用的饮食毫无关系，跟我的罪疚毫无关系，跟我对别人的怒气毫无关系，跟我面对挑战所需要的力量毫无关系，完全没有。那到底怎么回事呢？嗯，我在祷告的前半段在做什么？我在享受祂，我在留意祂，我在因祂欢喜，我对祂感到惊奇。好，在你求任何别的东西之前——这就是重点——祷告的首要目标，或者说你首先该求的，是祂自己。

你看，当人们说“祷告对我没用”的时候，我总会说：你什么意思叫祷告没用？他们总会告诉我：他们求了某样东西却没有得到——永远都是这样。但你看，主祷文基本上是在说，你在那里到底想做什么？你想用泡茶机来煮咖啡。耶稣说，祷告应该这样建构：在你求任何别的事之前，先求我。

所以，如果这里有人说“祷告对我不管用”，我想每天、日复一日、一次又一次、反反复复地追问你这个问题：你有没有说过，“我想要你，我想要你进入我的生命，我想要你的真实，我想经历你”？你有没有先这样做？这是不是主要目标？不，因为我告诉你，如果你先这样做，祷告就不会让你失望。

祷告主要就是为这个。你知道在《路加福音》里，主祷文是在哪儿被引出来的吗？在路加福音第11章，耶稣在那里教他们怎样祷告，并使用祂的主祷文。你看，在路加福音11章之前，有一个关于马大和马利亚的故事。马大——就是那位把耶稣接到家里的姊妹——在屋里跑来跑去做家务，她又烦又乱、心里分散、忙得不可开交等等。

耶稣温柔地责备她、带着爱地责备她，说：“马大，马大，马利亚已经得着那一件不可少的。”这很有意思：耶稣基督——就是基督的耶稣——在告诉我们这件事。所以我们最好把这话打开好好看看。你真正需要的只有一件事，其余一切都可以商量，其余一切都可以商量；你不需要别的。

如果你有了这个，其它一切都成了次要的。那是什么呢？当他说“只有一件事是不可少的”时，他接着说：马利亚正坐在我脚前听我的道。注释家都知道，并且会说：如此深深浸透诗篇、如此完全被诗篇所浸润的耶稣基督，不可能没有——抱歉这个双重否定——不可能不在心里想到诗篇里那段著名的话：诗篇二十七篇第四节，诗人大卫说：“有一件事，我曾求耶和华，我仍要寻求；就是一生一世住在耶和华的殿中，瞻仰耶和华的荣美，在他的殿里求问。”耶稣说的，与大卫说的是同一件事。大卫是一个有很多麻烦的人，他总是在逃命，总是在危机中；他是君王，是将军，卷入这一切事务；但他说：我真正需要的只有一件。大卫并没有把安全放在第一，也没有先求保护，也没有先求成功；在那么多重担压在他身上的时候，他说：若我的灵魂有一种感觉——一种里面的甘甜与荣光的感觉；若我的灵魂看见那美；若我不只是“知道关于神”的知识，而是实际尝到、看见他的美——他说，那样别的事就都不会困扰我了；别的事再也不能压垮我；别的事不会让我震惊；别的事不会把我勾走；我就能活出一种宽阔自在的生命。

耶稣这样评价马利亚，耶稣也这样对你说；接着就是主祷文，因为这正是它的要点，是它的语境：朋友关系。让我们继续。朋友关系是第一件事；因为祷告不是按别的方式建造的，你“不能”先去求别的，除非你先求他的友谊；除非你像发了疯似的去寻求它；除非你求得一种对他圣洁与慈爱的经历——不只是知道这些，而是在你心里真实有一种感觉——这才是第一点。

然后第二点，耶稣说：顺便说一句，这跟宗教式的路子很不一样；但第二点，与“新时代灵修”不同，耶稣说你接下来面对的是他的主权。祷告的第二个目的，除了“我们在天上的父”这种亲密之外，就是“愿你的国降临，愿你的旨意行在地上，如同行在天上”。这就是第二件事，而且相当吓人。在你开始求你想要的那些东西之前，耶稣说你必须先经过这一关。

而这才是你问题真正的根源。所以我们就一路往下冲到“日用的饮食”，冲到所有其他那些事上，因为我们心里就是这么想的。我们说：我害怕，我担心，我生气，而且我知道这个世界应该怎样运转。于是当我们祷告的时候，心里往往会向上帝倾泻出一大股话语：主啊，你必须这样做，你必须那样做。

她必须活下去，她必须看得见，这件事必须发生，我必须被录取，这笔钱必须到位，我实在看不出还有别的路——于是就有一股话语的洪流。顺便说一句，那其实就是在“喋喋不休”。这是个很贴切的翻译：我们在喋喋不休，我们在滔滔不绝地说个不停。

你知道吗？如果我们一开始就直奔“日用的饮食”，等我们祷告完，我们不会更不担心，反而会更焦虑。我们只是把那些把我们吓得半死的事情又排练了一遍。真是“好极了”。

而当我们祷告到下面，开始把所有那些对我们做坏事的人一一拿出来看的时候，等我们结束，我们会更苦毒、更愤怒，也会更内疚。“主啊，我太抱歉了，我太抱歉了，我不知道我为什么会这样做……”——话语的洪流，喋喋不休，喋喋不休，喋喋不休。

但耶稣说：先是这个——你漏掉了关键；你太快了。比“求东西”更优先的，是把你自己从“上帝的位置”上挪下来。直到你开始祷告之前，你心里最自然的姿态，就是四处走着（你若仔细听，就会听见），你的心总是在说：“愿我的国降临，愿我的旨意成就。”

“愿我的国降临，愿我的旨意成就。”而且实际上，这就是你真正麻烦的来源。直到最近我在研究《创世记》50章时，这一点才真正打到我心里。

在《创世记》50章里，约瑟——你记得吧，如果你知道那个故事——他被兄弟们出卖，被卖作奴隶。他的兄弟们基本上想要杀了他，想要毁掉他的人生。

到故事的最后，他们发现他已经升到高位，手里有权柄可以报复他们。等他们的父亲死了，他们就捎话说：“求你不要伤害我们。”约瑟把他们召集起来，他说了什么呢？“我已经饶恕你们了。这花了很多功夫，但我饶恕了你们。”

不，他怎么说？他说：我岂能代替　神吗？约瑟一切饶恕的源头，他平安的源头，他不再惧怕的源头——你害怕的时候，你知道你为什么害怕吗？你知道你为什么忧虑吗？你知道你为什么会被焦虑吞噬吗？

你们当中有些人现在就是这样。你知道为什么吗？因为你确信自己知道事情“应该”怎样发展。你怎么知道的？你怎么会知道事情应该怎样发展？

你把自己放在了　神的位置上。你默认就是这样。有些人心里满是怨恨，真的很怨恨，因为有些人对你做了某些事，可他们并没有遭到应得的报应之类的。你知道你为什么这么怨恨吗？不是因为环境。

也不是因为他们。是因为你以为你知道他们“应得”的是什么。你真的以为你知道吗？而约瑟说：我把自己从　神的位置上挪开了。这才是我不快乐的主要原因。

这才是我害怕的主要原因。

这才是我会生气的主要原因。我把它挪开了。我不再坐那个位置了。我怎么知道呢？

你看，这个模式的第二部分是：你必须经历他的主权。你必须愿意这样说——而这只会在祷告中发生。只要你愿意去追求，圣灵就会让它发生。如果你看见这件事真的重要，那么在你进入其他任何事情之前，你得先做这一件事。你必须说：主啊，求你借着圣灵，让我明白对我来说最重要、最该知道的一件事——你是　神，我不是。

可我其实并不相信。这就是我无法胜过内疚的原因，因为我觉得我必须活出一个样子；我必须成为自己的救主。这就是我无法胜过怒气的原因，因为我清清楚楚知道那些人该得什么。这就是我无法胜过忧虑和焦虑的原因，因为我知道这世界必须怎样运转。

我知道。我知道。约瑟说：从那个位置下来。多么可怕。马丁·路德过去常常对一些人这样说——有些人听我讲过这句话——因为马丁·路德有个朋友腓力·梅兰希顿，糟糕透了，他大概是死于胃溃疡的，就像你们当中有些人一样。

他叫腓力·梅兰希顿。马丁·路德时不时会走过来，拍拍他的背，说：让腓力停止统治世界吧。换句话说，马丁的意思是：腓力的问题，本质上是神学问题。并不是——所有心理问题归根到底都是神学问题。而从神学层面医治你的心，唯一的途径就是祷告。

通过注视他的属天性、注视他的君王权柄、注视他名的被尊为圣——他的圣洁、他的分别为圣。为什么这些内容要放在开头？因为你必须医治你的心，你必须医治你的眼光，并且愿意说：你是主。而当这发生时，你就开始那种生命——那种宏大的生命——没有什么能压垮你，没有什么能胜过你。现在第三点，这怎么可能发生？耶稣说其中一个原因是：宗教性的人在祷告生活里没有“友谊”。

有意思的是，越是非宗教的人，他们倒是有私下的祷告生活。他们冥想、寻求，诸如此类，但他们没有任何敬拜。这意味着他们会说：嗯，每个人都必须做自己要做的事；你得为自己决定什么是对、什么是错。你知道这意味着什么吗？你所追求的并不是一位会反驳你的上帝。

你所追求的不是一位能对你说：“我是神，你不是”的上帝。当你说：“我不相信传统，我不相信任何形式的权威；我必须为自己决定什么是对、什么是错。”你所做的，就是把自己彻底判了一个刑：余生都要坐在上帝的位置上。祝你好运。你根本不够资格做这份工作。

你知道在一份你不够资格胜任的工作里是什么感觉吗？没什么。你也许曾经做过一份你不够资格的工作，但跟这个比起来，完全不是一个量级。耶稣说：不，友谊先于求问；在你求任何事之前，你必须经历主权——要先经历祂是主。但你会说：“那怎么可能？我怎么能与他亲密到这种程度？”

“我怎么能如此亲密地认识他？我怎么能如此毫无保留地信靠他？”你听见了吗？宗教性的人会说：“我怎么能那么亲密地认识他？”你知道，耶稣教人说：“我们在天上的父。”如果你听见我说——即便你可能根本不认识我，对我一无所知——但如果你听到或无意中听到我说：“我的凯西”，你会立刻明白：无论凯西是谁，一定是妻子或女儿，因为你不会用这样的词，除非关系非常亲密。

而如果你无意中听到我这么说，那也只能是“无意中听到”，因为我绝不会当众说这种话。你也不会当众说这种话。为什么？你会觉得那样说太赤裸了。对于那些对你真正重要的人，你不会在公众场合用这种语言去称呼他们。

这是一种亲密的语言。耶稣说，你开始祷告时要说：神啊，你是我的神；父啊，你是我的父。可宗教型的人会说：我怎么知道呢？我怎么知道呢？我正很努力做个好人，我盼望神会恩待我。

我怎么知道呢？我怎么能用那样亲密的方式对待祂？而另一方面，第二种人——不宗教、但自称属灵的人——会说：你就说，信靠祂就好了；就说，你是神，然后，嗨，我就是那种，哇。可等一下，你怎么能那样信靠祂？答案就是福音的教义，或者说“儿子的名分”（adoption）的教义。

第一个称呼是：不是“我的君王”，不是“我的主”（当然祂也是），而是“我的父”“我们的父”。福音是：你成为基督徒，不是靠着各种技巧拼命努力，也不是靠着善行拼命努力。“儿子的名分”的教义是：当我说“父啊，因着耶稣所做的接纳我”时，我就成为基督徒。就在那一刻，圣经说，我们得着了儿子的名分。有时候，有些女士会对我说：你为什么总用“儿子的名分”这个词？这对我们其他人是不是有点不敏感？其实并不是。

我告诉你我为什么坚持用这个词。因为在新约那个时代，“儿子的名分”是一种法律身份：当你收养一个人，那人不仅与你建立亲密关系，而且立刻成为你的继承人；但当时只有男人会被收养，只有男人会得到“儿子的名分”。然而保罗、约翰以及所有新约作者竟大胆地说：当你接受基督作你的救主时，神无论你是谁——富或贫、男或女——都赐给你儿子的名分，你得着完全的权利。当你明白这一点，你就能祷告。可有人说：我不知道，我不知道这是否够。怎么可能呢？

怎么可能我能对神有这样的把握、这样的信心，与神有这样的亲密？答案在这里：耶稣基督来到西门彼得面前，在他即将跌倒之前，祂看着西门说：“西门，西门，撒但想要得着你，要筛你像筛麦子一样；但我已经为你祈求。”所以当你回转的时候，当你悔改的时候，当你恢复的时候，要坚固弟兄。耶稣说：“我已经为你祈求。”也就是说，也许你会回转吧，我不确定；我已经为你祈求了。

《希伯来书》第7章说：当你成为基督徒的时候，耶稣基督“长远活着，替我们祈求”（intercede）。这里的 intercede 是什么意思？其实就是祷告。《希伯来书》第7章说，耶稣基督已经重新定向了他的生命，所以他只为一件事而活。他活着就是为了——

我们知道他在做什么。他一直在为我们祷告。经上告诉我们，他仿佛站在父面前，并且不断地说：我希望他们生命里有这个，我希望他们生命里有那个，我希望他们生命里有美好的事。基本上，当我们祷告时，神就说：我已经准备好把这些不可思议的事倾倒进你的生命里——不是因为你的功劳，而是因为他的祷告生活。

你的祷告生活，无论多么微小、多么软弱——你所要做的就是开始祷告——你终于就站在一个位置上，准备好领受那要进入你生命的不可思议的事，因为这些事来自他的祷告生活。就是他为你祷告的生活。如果你知道他为你的祷告生活，如果你看见他为你的祷告生活，如果你知道你有那样的确据，那么你就能经历他的友谊，也能经历对他的敬拜。有人说：“哦，是吗？怎么做？”我能不能给你一个小小的操练？

每天十五分钟，不算查经时间。你可别把查经当成祷告：把一切都查个遍，坐下来弄完，然后只祷告两分钟——那不是祷告。你把经文查考完之后，拿出十五分钟，第一件事就是：在你开口说之前先听。主祷文的重点就是这个。在你求任何东西之前，前半段全都是在做什么？

注意他是谁，聆听他是谁，听见他是谁，然后你再回应。这就是主祷文。主祷文是在说：看这个、看这个、看这个；听这个、听这个。然后——现在有一些话我要对你说。主祷文的全部重点在于：祷告是在回答神。

祷告是对神的话语作出回应，不只是说话。如果你约见的是一位极其有权势的人，你不会坐下来就说：“我有很多事要告诉你”，然后一直说一直说，最后说：“希望你明白了，希望你听到了。我的一小时到了。”

事情就是这样。不，不，不——你该怎么做呢？先把要读的那段经文研究清楚，然后这十五分钟才开始。第一件事——最多用五、六、七分钟——就问经文两个问题：主啊，你在这里告诉我你是谁？主啊，你在这里告诉我我是谁？然后慢慢把经文再读一遍——你已经研究过了，对吧？

慢慢读这段经文，一边问这两个问题，一边聆听他的声音。然后当你把其中几条答案写下来之后——你看——接着就把这些内容祷告出来。经文告诉你关于他的是什么，你就敬拜他、为此感谢他；经文告诉你关于你的是什么，你就认罪，并为这些事祈求。

十五分钟一到，你就可以去做别的事。

你可以接着做你的代祷清单。你知道的，求主祝福爸爸妈妈之类的，全都可以做。而在那十五分钟之前，你也可以做你的查经。但你知道吗？你们当中有很多人在做查经、在做祷告清单，却并没有真正祷告。

你没有经历他作为朋友的同在，也没有因自己儿女的身份而生发出真正的敬拜。一定要把心敞开。每天十五分钟，在那段经文里聆听他的话，然后对他作出回应。每天十五分钟，连续做三十天。

如果你真要说：那我到底该从哪里开始呢？就去读诗篇，或者去读约翰福音。然后回来告诉我发生了什么。祷告之所以有功效，是因为你首先追求的是他的友谊和他的敬拜。他从来没有拒绝过这样的祷告。我们来祷告。

父啊，我们求你帮助我们成为祷告的人。我们当中有人甚至不确定自己信什么；但你唯一能找到“你自己”的路，就是祷告。我们当中也有很多人自以为很确定，可那只是在头脑里的知识。这个房间里的每一个人都需要回去祷告。

这个房间里的每一个人都需要找到那种彻底的内在真实——在那里，不管我们是基督徒、不是基督徒，还是根本搞不清自己到底算什么——我们都来祷告。父啊，我们为“祷告”而祷告。你的儿子——那位曾行走在地上最伟大的一位——常常祷告。现在我们知道为什么了：他是在为我们祷告。

我们知道他为我们祷告；并且只有当我们知道他一直为我们祷告，我们才会有能力自己过一个祷告的生活。所以求你帮助我们达成这个目标。我们奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。
