### Introduction: The Struggle with Change

Many of us try to change through sheer willpower, conquering bad habits or forcing better behavior, only to find ourselves snapping back to old patterns. In today's message, Tim Keller is exploring the fruit of the Spirit, showing how real transformation isn't about moral restraint, but a heart that, through Christ, is changed from the inside out.

The Scripture reading comes from Romans chapter 12 verses 10 through 21.

> Be devoted to one another and brotherly love, honor one another above yourselves, never be lacking in zeal but keep your spiritual fervor serving the Lord. Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer. Share with God's people who are in need, practice hospitality. Bless those who persecute you, bless and do not curse. Rejoice with those who rejoice, mourn with those who mourn. Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud but be willing to associate with people of low position. Do not be conceded. Do not repay anyone evil for evil, but be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everybody. If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. Do not take revenge, my friends, but leave room for God's wrath for it is written. It is mine to avenge, I will repay, says the Lord. On the contrary, if your enemy is hungry, feed him, if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will keep burning coals on his head. Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

This is God's word.

### The Principle of Patience

In Galatians chapter 5, verse 22, the fruit of the Spirit are listed. These are the marks of a supernaturally changed heart, love, joy, peace, patience, and so forth. Each week we are looking at one of these traits so that we can experience more of a supernaturally changed heart ourselves. Tonight we are going to look at the theme of patience.

If you have ever read an old English translation like the King James version, you will know that when you get to in the list like Galatians 5, 22, it goes love, joy, peace, patience. But in the older English translations, it will say long suffering. The reason why the older translation said that was because the Greek word for patience literally means to suffer a long time, which doesn't sound very promising, but what it's saying is, and this is the biblical idea of patience.

**Patience is that trait by which you are able to bear up under difficulty without giving up or giving into bitterness.**

Hear that? Patience is bearing up under difficult circumstances without giving up or giving into bitterness. And therefore there are two kinds of patience. There is the patience under difficult circumstances which we looked at last week really when we talked about peace in suffering. But the other kind of patience is patience and grace before difficult people, difficult relationships, patience with people.

And that's what this text, this passage that you just heard read to you, is a remarkable passage in which it talks about how to be patient and gracious to people who are opposing you, who are opposing you. It's going to give us a principle, some ideas on how to practice it, patience and grace before difficult people, and then lastly it will tell something about the power, how to get the power to do it.

There's the principle, there's the practice, and then there's the power for showing patience and grace before people who are opposing you.

### The Practice of Patience

So let's take a look at the principle first and there's a spectrum of people that we're talking about here. At one end of the spectrum are people who just don't really like you, they don't wrong you, they just don't like you, they don't work with you, they kind of work against you, they might be people at work or in your organization or whatever. These are people who just don't really work with you or help you, and then in the middle of the spectrum you've got people who have wronged you, they've hurt you, they've done an injustice to you, they've lied to you, they've cheated you in some way, and at the other end of the spectrum, the far end of the spectrum are persecutors, and persecutors are people who haven't just wronged you, they have it in for you, they want to lower your quality of life. They want to see you harmed, and so all along the spectrum from people who just work against you and are irritating to you and don't like you, to people who persecute you, what's our response supposed to be?

I tell you what the response is, the default mode of the heart is involuntary, when people wrong you retaliate, when people hurt you, you just retaliate, you don't sit and say, I think I'll retaliate, it just happens, you know, I mean if you want to know what the human heart looks like, Sigmund Freud said, one must forgive one's enemies, preferably after they've been hanged, which is another way of saying, of course I will forgive them, once I've killed them, then I'll forgive them, and that is the way the human heart works, but that's not what the principle is, it's laid down here, what is the principle?

It's in verse 17 and 21, and it's startling, it's amazing. At this point, by the way, Christianity diverges from every other religion, every other ethical system, in fact Christianity, there's no culture or society that believes this, whenever Christianity shows up in a society or culture, everybody thinks they're crazy, and here's what the principle is, verse 17, do not repay any one evil for evil, and then verse 21, do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good, now you put those together, here's what that's saying, the word overcome is a military word, it means to overpower, it means to defeat, and this is what it's saying, if when someone harms you, hurts you, you just hurt them back, when someone insults you, reviles you, you revile them back, when they hurt you and you hurt them back, you have been defeated by the evil, you've lost, you've been overpowered by it, you've become part of the problem, you've become evil yourself.

### The Power for Patience

Maybe that person who wronged you and was trying to hurt you didn't, wasn't maybe aiming to hurt you in this way, but the point is you have just given the perpetrator exactly what he or she wanted, if you repay evil for evil, you have been overcome by the evil, the only way to defeat evil is to overcome evil with good, what's that mean, here's what it means, if someone wrongs you, if you do not respond with forgiveness, with kind and gracious answers, and by willing they're good, not willing they're harmed, but willing they're good, if you don't forgive them, do kind and gracious responses, and will they're good, you have been overcome by evil, you've been defeated, you're part of the problem, you've become evil yourself.

How? Now, by the way, for a minute, we're going to get to this in a second. What does it mean to will the other persons, see, to repay evil for evil means I want to see them hurt, I want them to suffer like I've suffered, I want to bring them down, and there's really two ways to repay evil for evil, one is to go out there and bring about the painful situation yourself, and the other is to sit and not do anything but root against them, hope for, wish for that bad situation and that condition, and whenever you see them unhappy, you go, yes, see, and now that's you're still repaying evil for evil, you're still willing to evil, you're still wishing for it, you're either doing the retaliation or you're wishing you could retaliate, and so that's repaying evil for evil, and if you do that, you've been overcome by the evil, you've been defeated.

How so? I'll give you a quick three. One is, if you stay angry, if you stay in a retaliation mode, or even don't retaliate, but you just stay angry, stay bitter towards someone, first of all, it distorts and poisons all of your relationships. You may think, generally what happens, people who stay angry at somebody feel like, they feel like they're accomplishing something. What actually all they're doing is they're rooting themselves. If you, for example, let's just say you're a man, and a woman has hurt you, and you stay angry at that woman that's going to distort and affect all of your other relationships with women, and vice versa, of course, or whether person of another race or another class or another nationality, or just people, people wrong you, you hate them, you stop trusting people, it poisons your relationships, it distorts you, don't, don't think it doesn't.

Secondly, it doesn't just harm your relationships, it harms you, because the worst thing that can happen to you is to be pushed away from what the gospel wants for you. See, the gospel understands that the worst thing, practically the problem of the world is self-centeredness and self-righteousness. Self-righteousness says, I'm better than other people, self-centeredness says, I'm more important than anybody else. Me first, me first, self-righteousness says, I'm better than these people, or these people. Where do you think war comes from? Where do you think all our problems come from? That's what it comes from. And the whole point of the gospel is to destroy yourself righteousness, to destroy this idea that you're better than other people. Tell, it tells you you're a sinner saved by grace, but if you stay angry at somebody, you are taking the self-righteousness of your heart and you're ramping it up because when you get angry at somebody, you nurse this idea that you have been so hurt, you're the noble person has been hurt. And what it's doing is it's turning you into a self-centered, self-pitying, self-absorbed person capable of more cruelty, don't you see? The evil's winning.

You know, I don't have a thyroid and the reason, you know, if you're a young person and you have your thyroid out, it leaves a scar. If you're an old man and you have your thyroid out, it's just another wrinkle. So I can wear this, see. But if you look carefully, you'll see I have no thyroid, which means I have to take pills that replace the thyroid hormone. I've got to take pills for it to replace that because I don't have a thyroid gland. But I learned years ago that if I took calcium, or if I even drank calcium-fortified orange juice or milk when I was taking the pills, the calcium actually destroyed the ability of my body to absorb the thyroid. If you've taken your gospel pill that's supposed to take away your self-centered and self-righteousness, but you maintain a grudge, you're getting nothing out of your gospel pill, do you hear that?

And not only does retaliation and bitterness hurt your relationships and hurt your heart, but of course it also destroys the person that hurts perpetrated. If a person wrongs you and you pay them back, all you're doing is reinforcing them in their wrongness, you're reinforcing their behavior. You're making them think, you're not making them say, you know, if someone harms you and then you just pound them, do they say, I've seen the air of my ways, no. I said, I was right to do it. And of course, not only do you just create this cycle of insult and insult back and harming and harming back, but you also alienate their friends and though evil is winning. If you don't forgive, if you don't respond with graciousness and kindness, if you don't respond by willing the good of that person, evil wins. The perpetrator actually wins, maybe not in the way he thought, you become part of the problem of the world.

So how can we do this? By the way, that principle that you can only overcome evil with good, let's not jump to, well what do you do with, you know, let's not talk about nations, all right? You know, what is China do, what is America do, what is Europe do if you're attacked? I can only preach one sermon at a time, all right? And this is about you. But I want you to know that this idea that you can only ever come evil with good is a profoundly biblical theme. And actually, if anyone's ever seen any of the Lord of the Rings movies or read the Lord of the Rings book, you know, the story Lord of the Rings, you know what it's mainly about? It's about the idea that there's this ring and whoever wears the ring can rule the world and it was made by an evil Lord, but if you use the ring against the evil Lord, you'll become an evil Lord yourself. And so the only way to kill the evil Lord and destroy the evil Lord is not with power but with weakness and sacrifice. It's a profoundly biblical theme, do you not see? And it's the reason why when Jesus Christ came, He didn't come to bring judgment. He come to bear judgment.

So that's the principle. Number one, number two, practice. There's actually a number of very, very practical ways to go about this. If you say, all right, so someone wrongs me. Now, what am I supposed to do? How do I, how do I overcome evil with good? Let me give you five practical ideas from the text.

1. **Bless**: Verse 14, bless those who persecute you. And the word bless probably means pray for, pray God's blessing down. But even if that's not what it means right here, we know that Jesus says in Matthew 5, pray for those who persecute you. And remember, this is this end of the spectrum, persecute. Think about that. Pray for those who persecute you. Remember we said there's the people who don't like you, the people who are wrong you, the persecutors? Now, this is so practical. You really can't hate somebody you're praying for. You just can't pray for them and hate them at the same time. In fact, even if you say, oh, Lord, open the eyes of those idiots, I just want you to know you just turned a corner. You're praying for them. You're willing they're good. Prayer makes you do it. It's a discipline.

2. **Forgive**: Besides praying, you should always forgive. It's what it says, what it says, do not repay anyone. Do not take revenge, my friends. Do not take revenge. That means don't take revenge outside in your life and don't take revenge inside in your heart. I've heard a lot of people who say, I've forgiven them but I won't forget. And usually what that means is I'm not trying to harm them out there. I'm not taking revenge out there but I'm taking revenge inside. I don't think most New Yorkers who have nurse grudges realize that they're actually practicing voodoo. It's a kind of psychological voodoo. In other words, you're putting little pins in a little doll in your heart, hoping that somehow it'll hurt them. You're sitting there and rooting against them. That will poison you. It'll do all the things we said you. So what do you do? How do you forgive? Forgiveness is granted before it's felt. I've had an awful lot of people over here saying, I can't forgive them. I'm angry at them. I said, no, you're angry at them because you won't forgive them. What does that mean? What it means is you just essentially refrain. You refrain from sticking pins in them. You refrain from replaying your tapes, thinking about all the stuff that they did. You refrain from trying to retell at them outside but also you refrain from trying to retaliate inside and just you refrain from your revenge fantasies. You refrain from what you'd like to see happen to them. When your mind starts going, then you turn it away. You grant it long before you feel it but you grant it.

3. **Don't Avoid Them**: I love verse 18. If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live with everyone. What that means is they may not want to see you. They may stay away from you. Fine. You can't control that. See how realistic this is. But it does say, as far as it depends on you, try to stay in a relationship with them. I've had people say to me, oh, I've forgiven them, and I'm praying for them, but I want nothing to do with them. And what you probably mean is I'm punishing them by withdrawing my friendship. That's still punishment. You say, I've forgiven them. I'm not retaliating. I just want anything to do with them. What do you think that is? That's retaliation. If they don't want to stay away from you, don't you stay away from them?

4. **Will Their Good**: What does that mean? It's here where it says, if your enemy is hungry, feed him. If he's thirsty, give him something to drink. Now, what would that mean? What it's got to mean is not necessarily that you have to literally feed them a meal. What it means is in every way that you possibly can, you seek to will their good. You do what you can for their good. I've had people say to me, all right, if someone's wronged me, do I have to trust them? And I said, well, it depends on why. Because I'm going to show you how subtle this is. What if you have a friend who's an alcoholic or an addict, and you're trying to be a friend, you're loving them, you're trying to help them, you know, stay sober. Should you trust them? No. If you, not if you know that, if you know anything about addiction, of course, you don't trust them. Of course, you know how easy it is for the person to begin to lie and lapse and so forth. And therefore, if you love your friend, you probably will not trust them all the way. But the lack of trust, the withholding of trust, is a way that you're helping them. But you know, it's also possible to withhold trust from somebody as a way of hurting them. They're just refusing to let them change, of just refusing to see that they might be growing. So when somebody says, do I have to trust them, the answer is, again, no, in fact, probably if someone's wrong, you shouldn't trust them. But here's the reason why, because you want to see them grow, and you don't want to make it easy for them to keep on sinning.

5. **Oppose Them Humbly**: Now, this is a curve ball, but this is Christianity, and it's just amazing. You see this whole place where it says, if your enemy is hungry, feed him, if he's thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will keep burning coals on his head. Well, that's a sweet little image, isn't it? What the heck does that mean? And, actually, there is, I have to tell you, there's a fair amount of debate about it, a fair amount. But it probably means this. If you were in a besieged city, and there was an army out there trying to take your city, and you're defending your city, one of the ways you can defend your city, is you go up to the city wall, and you pour some kind of hot liquid or flaming liquid down on the people who are attacking. And, you know, I guess, they tell me that if your hair is on fire, it's hard to use your sword. It's difficult to aim very well when your hair is on fire. So, when you pour burning coals on your head, what do you do? They don't attack. And so, look at the paradox here. If a person is wronging you, you do stop them. You do oppose them. You do stop the attack. In fact, you might even do it in a way that's pretty painful. And yet, look at the context. If your enemy's hungry, feed him, if your enemy's thirsty, there is a mixture of opposition and yet love. You're opposing them for their good. You're opposing them because it's their meat and drink. In fact, look up at verse 16. Live in harmony with one other. Don't be proud. Don't be conceded. In Proverbs 15, and in 25, there's two Proverbs that I love. It says, a soft answer turns away wrath. A harsh answer stirs up anger. Now, when you see that, the soft answer means a gentle being gentle and gracious. When you first see that, that means okay. You don't talk back. But then it says in Proverbs 25, 11, a gentle word can break a bone. And what it's saying is this, do you want to persuade people? Do you really want to change people? If a person is sinning, if a person is wronging you, you must oppose them. Why? The most unloving thing possible is to just let a person go on sinning. It's very unloving. So you're trying to oppose them. You're trying to stop them. But you do it softly. You do it graciously. You do it humbly. You do it clearly showing that you're trying to feed them and give them drink, which means here's how you know you're doing it right. If you go to a person who's wronged you, and you tell them what they've done wrong in such a way that the person sits there and says I don't like what this person's saying. I don't even think I agree with it. But it's very clear that this person cares for me. Then there's a 50, 50 chance the person might actually change. But I'll tell you something. If you go and you confront and you oppose them and you say, I'm seeking truth. I'm seeking justice. And it's very clear to that person that you're confronting, that you like the confrontation. You're enjoying it. You're putting them down. You're punishing them. You're not doing it for truth's sake. You're not doing it for God's sake. You're doing it for your sake. You're not doing it for his sake or her sake. And therefore if you oppose without first forgiving and blessing and praying and loving and being humble, if you oppose without all those other things, you're never going to see evil, you know, recede. You're never going to get that person to really see the error of his or her ways. I know an awful lot of people who are very proud that they do use harsh language. They are abrasive. They're always being very forthright. And as a result, because their words aren't soft and gentle, nobody's ever persuaded. And they feel that that's fine. I have been valiant for the truth, which means they don't care about the truth because they cared about the truth. They'd say it in a way that people could be persuaded, so that people were persuaded. Instead, they like the fact they offend people. They like the fact that people are upset with them. That makes them feel very noble. They pat themselves on the back. That is evil. That's the self-righteousness that repaying for evil for evil creates. No, no. You need to forgive the people before you even tell them what they're doing wrong. You need to pray for them. You need to not avoid them. You need to will their good. And when you go and talk to them about their fault, you need to do it humbly, but you also have to do it. You can't make it easy for people to sin against you. That's the worst thing for them. And don't you see how weird this is? Almost everybody I know, either resentfully confronts or excuses and just keeps their mouth shut. Oh, don't make waves. Say, loving, keeping your mouth shut, resenting, keeping your mouth open, but we're supposed to love and keep your mouth open. And nobody does that, which brings us to our last point.

### The Power for Patience

Where do you get the power for this? Well, now, at first sight, you might think you get the power from a strict excitation because in verse 19, God says, literally, do not take revenge, my friends, but leave room for God's wrath. It is mind revenge. I will repay, says the Lord. Do not take revenge. Now, what does God say? You know what he's saying? Get out of my chair. Only I have the right and the ability to sit in the judgment seat. In fact, look at that, look at that, where it says, leave room for God's wrath. Isn't that interesting? This is what we're saying. This is what God is saying to you. He's saying, you don't really know what this person deserves. You don't know. You're sitting up there and you're imagining things that should happen to that person. You don't know. Look, listen, you know, I often say this way, when somebody lies to you and you get mad at them, what do you say? Lire. But if you lie to somebody, do you ever lie? Yes. Well, why do you lie? Well, it's complicated. You see, the person who's wronged you is a one-dimensional cartoon character. He's just a liar. But when you lie, well, it's very complicated. There's these extenuating circumstances. There's this and there's that. And my mother didn't love me. And all kinds of things. But guess what? The reality is somewhere in the middle. See, when you're mad at somebody, God looks at you, I think, and says, you don't not know what that person has gone through. You don't know what their background is. You don't know what kind of day that person had. You don't know what their relationship with their mother was. You don't know these things. Only I know what that person deserves. So get out of my chair.

But we can't end this sermon that way, because that doesn't give us power. It kind of humbles us and says, yeah, I ought to get out of the chair. But here's where you get the power to overcome you with good. This is patience and grace in the face of opposition. It comes from the mercies of God. What's interesting? I couldn't do this. This is the problem with printing the text. Actually, chapter 12 starts up in the beginning where Paul says, I beseech you in view of the mercies of God, in view of the mercies of God. I beseech you and then he gives all these, the rest of the chapter, our various expectations on how to live. And therefore everything he says here can only be done in view of the mercies of God. Now, he could have said because of the mercies of God, and that would have worked, but he uses the word view. A view is a breathtaking experience. Panorama. And here's what Paul is saying. If you want to overcome you with good, you have to have a panoramic breathtaking view of God's mercy to you.

And it's interesting that the place where Jesus talks most about forgiveness, mercy is at the heart of how he helps us forgive. Let me close by telling you the parable that he gives in Matthew 18. It's a very up-to-date parable. There was a king, and he had a servant, and the servant owed the king 10,000 talents. And commentators always freak out over that number because it really meant billions and trillions of dollars. It was a ridiculous sum. And it could not have meant, therefore, alone. No king could have possibly given any servant 10,000 talents. It must mean that the servant was a high official in the kingdom, and that through mismanagement and malfeasance, he had lost an enormous amount of money, so the very economy and the very kingdom was in jeopardy. Sound familiar? Up-to-date. So the king comes to the servant and says, where's my money? Pay me. And the servant says, I can't forgive me and the king, though he had every right to sit in judgment, forgive him. It has mercy on him.

So then that servant walks along and sees a second servant. And that second servant owes the first servant, the forgiven servant, a few dollars. And the first servant says, pay me, and the second servant says, I don't have it. I don't have it. Forgive me. And this first servant says no, and throws them into prison. And when the king hears this, he grabs the first servant and he says, shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant as I had mercy on you? Didn't you see my mercy? Didn't you view my mercy, says the king? Didn't you have an experience of my mercy? How can anyone who's experienced my mercy have a grudge hold their fellow servant viable? And then, at the end of the parable, he throws the first servant into prison and then Jesus ends with his chilling line. So will my heavenly Father do to you if you do not forgive your brother from the heart? You know what that means? The only way you can be spiritually lost is if you refuse to believe you're a sinner who needs to be saved by grace. The only way you can be spiritually lost, according to the Bible, is through pride, is to say, I don't need charity. You can only be lost by not believing refusing to believe that you are a sinner who needs to be saved strictly by grace. Well, then wait a minute. What is Jesus saying? Here's what he's saying, if you hold a grudge, if you retaliate against somebody else, then even though you say you believe you're a sinner saved by grace, you don't. You don't believe it. You're denying it no matter what you say. That is a picture of us, though. The most, the incongruity is you have a servant acting like a king and a judge. A servant that, no, into prison, when a servant acts like a king or a judge, it's incongruous. But that's you and me. That's why we're angry with each other. That's why we're paying each other back. That's why we're sitting in judgment. We're servants acting like kings and judges. What will change our hearts? The only thing that will change a servant from acting like a king is by getting a view of the amazing love of the king who became a servant. We should be in the dock. We put ourselves on the judgment seat, but the Lord who was on the judgment seat came down and put himself on the dock and he went to the cross. The judge of all the earth was judged. He was punished for us so that he took the punishment we deserve for all the way, which we harm each other. That's what will give you what you need to forgive. The gospel, if you believe it, if you see it, and that's what the Lord suffers about, if you see the mercy, it humbles you. You can't stay angry at somebody unless you feel superior to them. So it humbles you out of your bitterness, but it also affirms you out of your bitterness because it says, you don't have to justify yourself. I've been justified in Jesus Christ. I don't have to justify myself. I don't have to justify myself to you. I don't have to worry about my reputation. I don't care what you've done. And then you can forgive.

You know, I know there's people out there who say, sometimes you've got to, you know, well, people will say, you've got to tell the truth. Of course you do. And you got to be hard. You got to be strong. Of course you do. But when Jesus Christ was dying on the cross because he was being executed unjustly in Luke 23, 34, he actually says, father forgive them. They don't know what they're doing. Would you think about that as we close? Father forgive them. They don't know what they're doing. You see the balance? First of all, he says, father, what they're doing is wrong. They need to be forgiven. They are guilty. And I'm dying for them, for their guilt. But look at it. His executioners, instead of yelling at them and screaming at them, you'll get yours. What does he say? Father, they really don't understand the magnitude of what they're doing. Jesus has something good to say about his executioners. Look at that balance. If he treats his executioners like that, how dare you and I be cold and withdrawing to people or sarcastic and insulting and slashing and burning people? How dare we talk like that? He wouldn't even talk like at the very end.

Oh Lord, give us the grace and patience that can grow only out of a great view of your dying saving mercy.

Let's pray. Father, the Lord's Supper is a time for us to get a view of your mercy. Give us a view of your mercy so that we can overcome evil with good. Lord, not everybody in this room is struggling with us right now, but a lot of people are. And everybody will need this. So give us the power that we need. In view of your mercy, it's to overcome evil with good. We pray in Jesus' name.

### Introduction: The Struggle with Change

Many of us try to change through sheer willpower, conquering bad habits or forcing better behavior, only to find ourselves snapping back to old patterns. In today's message, Tim Keller is exploring the fruit of the Spirit, showing how real transformation isn't about moral restraint, but a heart that, through Christ, is changed from the inside out.

The Scripture reading comes from Romans chapter 12 verses 10 through 21.

> Be devoted to one another and brotherly love, honor one another above yourselves, never be lacking in zeal but keep your spiritual fervor serving the Lord. Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer. Share with God's people who are in need, practice hospitality. Bless those who persecute you, bless and do not curse. Rejoice with those who rejoice, mourn with those who mourn. Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud but be willing to associate with people of low position. Do not be conceded. Do not repay anyone evil for evil, but be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everybody. If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. Do not take revenge, my friends, but leave room for God's wrath for it is written. It is mine to avenge, I will repay, says the Lord. On the contrary, if your enemy is hungry, feed him, if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will keep burning coals on his head. Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

This is God's word.

### The Principle of Patience

In Galatians chapter 5, verse 22, the fruit of the Spirit are listed. These are the marks of a supernaturally changed heart, love, joy, peace, patience, and so forth. Each week we are looking at one of these traits so that we can experience more of a supernaturally changed heart ourselves. Tonight we are going to look at the theme of patience.

If you have ever read an old English translation like the King James version, you will know that when you get to in the list like Galatians 5, 22, it goes love, joy, peace, patience. But in the older English translations, it will say long suffering. The reason why the older translation said that was because the Greek word for patience literally means to suffer a long time, which doesn't sound very promising, but what it's saying is, and this is the biblical idea of patience.

**Patience is that trait by which you are able to bear up under difficulty without giving up or giving into bitterness.**

Hear that? Patience is bearing up under difficult circumstances without giving up or giving into bitterness. And therefore there are two kinds of patience. There is the patience under difficult circumstances which we looked at last week really when we talked about peace in suffering. But the other kind of patience is patience and grace before difficult people, difficult relationships, patience with people.

And that's what this text, this passage that you just heard read to you, is a remarkable passage in which it talks about how to be patient and gracious to people who are opposing you, who are opposing you. It's going to give us a principle, some ideas on how to practice it, patience and grace before difficult people, and then lastly it will tell something about the power, how to get the power to do it.

There's the principle, there's the practice, and then there's the power for showing patience and grace before people who are opposing you.

### The Practice of Patience

So let's take a look at the principle first and there's a spectrum of people that we're talking about here. At one end of the spectrum are people who just don't really like you, they don't wrong you, they just don't like you, they don't work with you, they kind of work against you, they might be people at work or in your organization or whatever. These are people who just don't really work with you or help you, and then in the middle of the spectrum you've got people who have wronged you, they've hurt you, they've done an injustice to you, they've lied to you, they've cheated you in some way, and at the other end of the spectrum, the far end of the spectrum are persecutors, and persecutors are people who haven't just wronged you, they have it in for you, they want to lower your quality of life. They want to see you harmed, and so all along the spectrum from people who just work against you and are irritating to you and don't like you, to people who persecute you, what's our response supposed to be?

I tell you what the response is, the default mode of the heart is involuntary, when people wrong you retaliate, when people hurt you, you just retaliate, you don't sit and say, I think I'll retaliate, it just happens, you know, I mean if you want to know what the human heart looks like, Sigmund Freud said, one must forgive one's enemies, preferably after they've been hanged, which is another way of saying, of course I will forgive them, once I've killed them, then I'll forgive them, and that is the way the human heart works, but that's not what the principle is, it's laid down here, what is the principle?

It's in verse 17 and 21, and it's startling, it's amazing. At this point, by the way, Christianity diverges from every other religion, every other ethical system, in fact Christianity, there's no culture or society that believes this, whenever Christianity shows up in a society or culture, everybody thinks they're crazy, and here's what the principle is, verse 17, do not repay any one evil for evil, and then verse 21, do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good, now you put those together, here's what that's saying, the word overcome is a military word, it means to overpower, it means to defeat, and this is what it's saying, if when someone harms you, hurts you, you just hurt them back, when someone insults you, reviles you, you revile them back, when they hurt you and you hurt them back, you have been defeated by the evil, you've lost, you've been overpowered by it, you've become part of the problem, you've become evil yourself.

### The Power for Patience

Maybe that person who wronged you and was trying to hurt you didn't, wasn't maybe aiming to hurt you in this way, but the point is you have just given the perpetrator exactly what he or she wanted, if you repay evil for evil, you have been overcome by the evil, the only way to defeat evil is to overcome evil with good, what's that mean, here's what it means, if someone wrongs you, if you do not respond with forgiveness, with kind and gracious answers, and by willing they're good, not willing they're harmed, but willing they're good, if you don't forgive them, do kind and gracious responses, and will they're good, you have been overcome by evil, you've been defeated, you're part of the problem, you've become evil yourself.

How? Now, by the way, for a minute, we're going to get to this in a second. What does it mean to will the other persons, see, to repay evil for evil means I want to see them hurt, I want them to suffer like I've suffered, I want to bring them down, and there's really two ways to repay evil for evil, one is to go out there and bring about the painful situation yourself, and the other is to sit and not do anything but root against them, hope for, wish for that bad situation and that condition, and whenever you see them unhappy, you go, yes, see, and now that's you're still repaying evil for evil, you're still willing to evil, you're still wishing for it, you're either doing the retaliation or you're wishing you could retaliate, and so that's repaying evil for evil, and if you do that, you've been overcome by the evil, you've been defeated.

How so? I'll give you a quick three. One is, if you stay angry, if you stay in a retaliation mode, or even don't retaliate, but you just stay angry, stay bitter towards someone, first of all, it distorts and poisons all of your relationships. You may think, generally what happens, people who stay angry at somebody feel like, they feel like they're accomplishing something. What actually all they're doing is they're rooting themselves. If you, for example, let's just say you're a man, and a woman has hurt you, and you stay angry at that woman that's going to distort and affect all of your other relationships with women, and vice versa, of course, or whether person of another race or another class or another nationality, or just people, people wrong you, you hate them, you stop trusting people, it poisons your relationships, it distorts you, don't, don't think it doesn't.

Secondly, it doesn't just harm your relationships, it harms you, because the worst thing that can happen to you is to be pushed away from what the gospel wants for you. See, the gospel understands that the worst thing, practically the problem of the world is self-centeredness and self-righteousness. Self-righteousness says, I'm better than other people, self-centeredness says, I'm more important than anybody else. Me first, me first, self-righteousness says, I'm better than these people, or these people. Where do you think war comes from? Where do you think all our problems come from? That's what it comes from. And the whole point of the gospel is to destroy yourself righteousness, to destroy this idea that you're better than other people. Tell, it tells you you're a sinner saved by grace, but if you stay angry at somebody, you are taking the self-righteousness of your heart and you're ramping it up because when you get angry at somebody, you nurse this idea that you have been so hurt, you're the noble person has been hurt. And what it's doing is it's turning you into a self-centered, self-pitying, self-absorbed person capable of more cruelty, don't you see? The evil's winning.

You know, I don't have a thyroid and the reason, you know, if you're a young person and you have your thyroid out, it leaves a scar. If you're an old man and you have your thyroid out, it's just another wrinkle. So I can wear this, see. But if you look carefully, you'll see I have no thyroid, which means I have to take pills that replace the thyroid hormone. I've got to take pills for it to replace that because I don't have a thyroid gland. But I learned years ago that if I took calcium, or if I even drank calcium-fortified orange juice or milk when I was taking the pills, the calcium actually destroyed the ability of my body to absorb the thyroid. If you've taken your gospel pill that's supposed to take away your self-centered and self-righteousness, but you maintain a grudge, you're getting nothing out of your gospel pill, do you hear that?

And not only does retaliation and bitterness hurt your relationships and hurt your heart, but of course it also destroys the person that hurts perpetrated. If a person wrongs you and you pay them back, all you're doing is reinforcing them in their wrongness, you're reinforcing their behavior. You're making them think, you're not making them say, you know, if someone harms you and then you just pound them, do they say, I've seen the air of my ways, no. I said, I was right to do it. And of course, not only do you just create this cycle of insult and insult back and harming and harming back, but you also alienate their friends and though evil is winning. If you don't forgive, if you don't respond with graciousness and kindness, if you don't respond by willing the good of that person, evil wins. The perpetrator actually wins, maybe not in the way he thought, you become part of the problem of the world.

So how can we do this? By the way, that principle that you can only overcome evil with good, let's not jump to, well what do you do with, you know, let's not talk about nations, all right? You know, what is China do, what is America do, what is Europe do if you're attacked? I can only preach one sermon at a time, all right? And this is about you. But I want you to know that this idea that you can only ever come evil with good is a profoundly biblical theme. And actually, if anyone's ever seen any of the Lord of the Rings movies or read the Lord of the Rings book, you know, the story Lord of the Rings, you know what it's mainly about? It's about the idea that there's this ring and whoever wears the ring can rule the world and it was made by an evil Lord, but if you use the ring against the evil Lord, you'll become an evil Lord yourself. And so the only way to kill the evil Lord and destroy the evil Lord is not with power but with weakness and sacrifice. It's a profoundly biblical theme, do you not see? And it's the reason why when Jesus Christ came, He didn't come to bring judgment. He come to bear judgment.

So that's the principle. Number one, number two, practice. There's actually a number of very, very practical ways to go about this. If you say, all right, so someone wrongs me. Now, what am I supposed to do? How do I, how do I overcome evil with good? Let me give you five practical ideas from the text.

1. **Bless**: Verse 14, bless those who persecute you. And the word bless probably means pray for, pray God's blessing down. But even if that's not what it means right here, we know that Jesus says in Matthew 5, pray for those who persecute you. And remember, this is this end of the spectrum, persecute. Think about that. Pray for those who persecute you. Remember we said there's the people who don't like you, the people who are wrong you, the persecutors? Now, this is so practical. You really can't hate somebody you're praying for. You just can't pray for them and hate them at the same time. In fact, even if you say, oh, Lord, open the eyes of those idiots, I just want you to know you just turned a corner. You're praying for them. You're willing they're good. Prayer makes you do it. It's a discipline.

2. **Forgive**: Besides praying, you should always forgive. It's what it says, what it says, do not repay anyone. Do not take revenge, my friends. Do not take revenge. That means don't take revenge outside in your life and don't take revenge inside in your heart. I've heard a lot of people who say, I've forgiven them but I won't forget. And usually what that means is I'm not trying to harm them out there. I'm not taking revenge out there but I'm taking revenge inside. I don't think most New Yorkers who have nurse grudges realize that they're actually practicing voodoo. It's a kind of psychological voodoo. In other words, you're putting little pins in a little doll in your heart, hoping that somehow it'll hurt them. You're sitting there and rooting against them. That will poison you. It'll do all the things we said you. So what do you do? How do you forgive? Forgiveness is granted before it's felt. I've had an awful lot of people over here saying, I can't forgive them. I'm angry at them. I said, no, you're angry at them because you won't forgive them. What does that mean? What it means is you just essentially refrain. You refrain from sticking pins in them. You refrain from replaying your tapes, thinking about all the stuff that they did. You refrain from trying to retell at them outside but also you refrain from trying to retaliate inside and just you refrain from your revenge fantasies. You refrain from what you'd like to see happen to them. When your mind starts going, then you turn it away. You grant it long before you feel it but you grant it.

3. **Don't Avoid Them**: I love verse 18. If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live with everyone. What that means is they may not want to see you. They may stay away from you. Fine. You can't control that. See how realistic this is. But it does say, as far as it depends on you, try to stay in a relationship with them. I've had people say to me, oh, I've forgiven them, and I'm praying for them, but I want nothing to do with them. And what you probably mean is I'm punishing them by withdrawing my friendship. That's still punishment. You say, I've forgiven them. I'm not retaliating. I just want anything to do with them. What do you think that is? That's retaliation. If they don't want to stay away from you, don't you stay away from them?

4. **Will Their Good**: What does that mean? It's here where it says, if your enemy is hungry, feed him. If he's thirsty, give him something to drink. Now, what would that mean? What it's got to mean is not necessarily that you have to literally feed them a meal. What it means is in every way that you possibly can, you seek to will their good. You do what you can for their good. I've had people say to me, all right, if someone's wronged me, do I have to trust them? And I said, well, it depends on why. Because I'm going to show you how subtle this is. What if you have a friend who's an alcoholic or an addict, and you're trying to be a friend, you're loving them, you're trying to help them, you know, stay sober. Should you trust them? No. If you, not if you know that, if you know anything about addiction, of course, you don't trust them. Of course, you know how easy it is for the person to begin to lie and lapse and so forth. And therefore, if you love your friend, you probably will not trust them all the way. But the lack of trust, the withholding of trust, is a way that you're helping them. But you know, it's also possible to withhold trust from somebody as a way of hurting them. They're just refusing to let them change, of just refusing to see that they might be growing. So when somebody says, do I have to trust them, the answer is, again, no, in fact, probably if someone's wrong, you shouldn't trust them. But here's the reason why, because you want to see them grow, and you don't want to make it easy for them to keep on sinning.

5. **Oppose Them Humbly**: Now, this is a curve ball, but this is Christianity, and it's just amazing. You see this whole place where it says, if your enemy is hungry, feed him, if he's thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will keep burning coals on his head. Well, that's a sweet little image, isn't it? What the heck does that mean? And, actually, there is, I have to tell you, there's a fair amount of debate about it, a fair amount. But it probably means this. If you were in a besieged city, and there was an army out there trying to take your city, and you're defending your city, one of the ways you can defend your city, is you go up to the city wall, and you pour some kind of hot liquid or flaming liquid down on the people who are attacking. And, you know, I guess, they tell me that if your hair is on fire, it's hard to use your sword. It's difficult to aim very well when your hair is on fire. So, when you pour burning coals on your head, what do you do? They don't attack. And so, look at the paradox here. If a person is wronging you, you do stop them. You do oppose them. You do stop the attack. In fact, you might even do it in a way that's pretty painful. And yet, look at the context. If your enemy's hungry, feed him, if your enemy's thirsty, there is a mixture of opposition and yet love. You're opposing them for their good. You're opposing them because it's their meat and drink. In fact, look up at verse 16. Live in harmony with one other. Don't be proud. Don't be conceded. In Proverbs 15, and in 25, there's two Proverbs that I love. It says, a soft answer turns away wrath. A harsh answer stirs up anger. Now, when you see that, the soft answer means a gentle being gentle and gracious. When you first see that, that means okay. You don't talk back. But then it says in Proverbs 25, 11, a gentle word can break a bone. And what it's saying is this, do you want to persuade people? Do you really want to change people? If a person is sinning, if a person is wronging you, you must oppose them. Why? The most unloving thing possible is to just let a person go on sinning. It's very unloving. So you're trying to oppose them. You're trying to stop them. But you do it softly. You do it graciously. You do it humbly. You do it clearly showing that you're trying to feed them and give them drink, which means here's how you know you're doing it right. If you go to a person who's wronged you, and you tell them what they've done wrong in such a way that the person sits there and says I don't like what this person's saying. I don't even think I agree with it. But it's very clear that this person cares for me. Then there's a 50, 50 chance the person might actually change. But I'll tell you something. If you go and you confront and you oppose them and you say, I'm seeking truth. I'm seeking justice. And it's very clear to that person that you're confronting, that you like the confrontation. You're enjoying it. You're putting them down. You're punishing them. You're not doing it for truth's sake. You're not doing it for God's sake. You're doing it for your sake. You're not doing it for his sake or her sake. And therefore if you oppose without first forgiving and blessing and praying and loving and being humble, if you oppose without all those other things, you're never going to see evil, you know, recede. You're never going to get that person to really see the error of his or her ways. I know an awful lot of people who are very proud that they do use harsh language. They are abrasive. They're always being very forthright. And as a result, because their words aren't soft and gentle, nobody's ever persuaded. And they feel that that's fine. I have been valiant for the truth, which means they don't care about the truth because they cared about the truth. They'd say it in a way that people could be persuaded, so that people were persuaded. Instead, they like the fact they offend people. They like the fact that people are upset with them. That makes them feel very noble. They pat themselves on the back. That is evil. That's the self-righteousness that repaying for evil for evil creates. No, no. You need to forgive the people before you even tell them what they're doing wrong. You need to pray for them. You need to not avoid them. You need to will their good. And when you go and talk to them about their fault, you need to do it humbly, but you also have to do it. You can't make it easy for people to sin against you. That's the worst thing for them. And don't you see how weird this is? Almost everybody I know, either resentfully confronts or excuses and just keeps their mouth shut. Oh, don't make waves. Say, loving, keeping your mouth shut, resenting, keeping your mouth open, but we're supposed to love and keep your mouth open. And nobody does that, which brings us to our last point.

### The Power for Patience

Where do you get the power for this? Well, now, at first sight, you might think you get the power from a strict excitation because in verse 19, God says, literally, do not take revenge, my friends, but leave room for God's wrath. It is mind revenge. I will repay, says the Lord. Do not take revenge. Now, what does God say? You know what he's saying? Get out of my chair. Only I have the right and the ability to sit in the judgment seat. In fact, look at that, look at that, where it says, leave room for God's wrath. Isn't that interesting? This is what we're saying. This is what God is saying to you. He's saying, you don't really know what this person deserves. You don't know. You're sitting up there and you're imagining things that should happen to that person. You don't know. Look, listen, you know, I often say this way, when somebody lies to you and you get mad at them, what do you say? Lire. But if you lie to somebody, do you ever lie? Yes. Well, why do you lie? Well, it's complicated. You see, the person who's wronged you is a one-dimensional cartoon character. He's just a liar. But when you lie, well, it's very complicated. There's these extenuating circumstances. There's this and there's that. And my mother didn't love me. And all kinds of things. But guess what? The reality is somewhere in the middle. See, when you're mad at somebody, God looks at you, I think, and says, you don't not know what that person has gone through. You don't know what their background is. You don't know what kind of day that person had. You don't know what their relationship with their mother was. You don't know these things. Only I know what that person deserves. So get out of my chair.

But we can't end this sermon that way, because that doesn't give us power. It kind of humbles us and says, yeah, I ought to get out of the chair. But here's where you get the power to overcome you with good. This is patience and grace in the face of opposition. It comes from the mercies of God. What's interesting? I couldn't do this. This is the problem with printing the text. Actually, chapter 12 starts up in the beginning where Paul says, I beseech you in view of the mercies of God, in view of the mercies of God. I beseech you and then he gives all these, the rest of the chapter, our various expectations on how to live. And therefore everything he says here can only be done in view of the mercies of God. Now, he could have said because of the mercies of God, and that would have worked, but he uses the word view. A view is a breathtaking experience. Panorama. And here's what Paul is saying. If you want to overcome you with good, you have to have a panoramic breathtaking view of God's mercy to you.

And it's interesting that the place where Jesus talks most about forgiveness, mercy is at the heart of how he helps us forgive. Let me close by telling you the parable that he gives in Matthew 18. It's a very up-to-date parable. There was a king, and he had a servant, and the servant owed the king 10,000 talents. And commentators always freak out over that number because it really meant billions and trillions of dollars. It was a ridiculous sum. And it could not have meant, therefore, alone. No king could have possibly given any servant 10,000 talents. It must mean that the servant was a high official in the kingdom, and that through mismanagement and malfeasance, he had lost an enormous amount of money, so the very economy and the very kingdom was in jeopardy. Sound familiar? Up-to-date. So the king comes to the servant and says, where's my money? Pay me. And the servant says, I can't forgive me and the king, though he had every right to sit in judgment, forgive him. It has mercy on him.

So then that servant walks along and sees a second servant. And that second servant owes the first servant, the forgiven servant, a few dollars. And the first servant says, pay me, and the second servant says, I don't have it. I don't have it. Forgive me. And this first servant says no, and throws them into prison. And when the king hears this, he grabs the first servant and he says, shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant as I had mercy on you? Didn't you see my mercy? Didn't you view my mercy, says the king? Didn't you have an experience of my mercy? How can anyone who's experienced my mercy have a grudge hold their fellow servant viable? And then, at the end of the parable, he throws the first servant into prison and then Jesus ends with his chilling line. So will my heavenly Father do to you if you do not forgive your brother from the heart? You know what that means? The only way you can be spiritually lost is if you refuse to believe you're a sinner who needs to be saved by grace. The only way you can be spiritually lost, according to the Bible, is through pride, is to say, I don't need charity. You can only be lost by not believing refusing to believe that you are a sinner who needs to be saved strictly by grace. Well, then wait a minute. What is Jesus saying? Here's what he's saying, if you hold a grudge, if you retaliate against somebody else, then even though you say you believe you're a sinner saved by grace, you don't. You don't believe it. You're denying it no matter what you say. That is a picture of us, though. The most, the incongruity is you have a servant acting like a king and a judge. A servant that, no, into prison, when a servant acts like a king or a judge, it's incongruous. But that's you and me. That's why we're angry with each other. That's why we're paying each other back. That's why we're sitting in judgment. We're servants acting like kings and judges. What will change our hearts? The only thing that will change a servant from acting like a king is by getting a view of the amazing love of the king who became a servant. We should be in the dock. We put ourselves on the judgment seat, but the Lord who was on the judgment seat came down and put himself on the dock and he went to the cross. The judge of all the earth was judged. He was punished for us so that he took the punishment we deserve for all the way, which we harm each other. That's what will give you what you need to forgive. The gospel, if you believe it, if you see it, and that's what the Lord suffers about, if you see the mercy, it humbles you. You can't stay angry at somebody unless you feel superior to them. So it humbles you out of your bitterness, but it also affirms you out of your bitterness because it says, you don't have to justify yourself. I've been justified in Jesus Christ. I don't have to justify myself. I don't have to justify myself to you. I don't have to worry about my reputation. I don't care what you've done. And then you can forgive.

You know, I know there's people out there who say, sometimes you've got to, you know, well, people will say, you've got to tell the truth. Of course you do. And you got to be hard. You got to be strong. Of course you do. But when Jesus Christ was dying on the cross because he was being executed unjustly in Luke 23, 34, he actually says, father forgive them. They don't know what they're doing. Would you think about that as we close? Father forgive them. They don't know what they're doing. You see the balance? First of all, he says, father, what they're doing is wrong. They need to be forgiven. They are guilty. And I'm dying for them, for their guilt. But look at it. His executioners, instead of yelling at them and screaming at them, you'll get yours. What does he say? Father, they really don't understand the magnitude of what they're doing. Jesus has something good to say about his executioners. Look at that balance. If he treats his executioners like that, how dare you and I be cold and withdrawing to people or sarcastic and insulting and slashing and burning people? How dare we talk like that? He wouldn't even talk like at the very end.

Oh Lord, give us the grace and patience that can grow only out of a great view of your dying saving mercy.

Let's pray. Father, the Lord's Supper is a time for us to get a view of your mercy. Give us a view of your mercy so that we can overcome evil with good. Lord, not everybody in this room is struggling with us right now, but a lot of people are. And everybody will need this. So give us the power that we need. In view of your mercy, it's to overcome evil with good. We pray in Jesus' name.

我们中的许多人试图通过纯粹的意志力来改变，克服坏习惯或强迫更好的行为，结果却发现自己又回到了旧的模式。在今天的信息中，Tim Keller 探讨了圣灵的果实，展示了真正的转变不是关于道德约束，而是通过基督从内到外改变的心。

经文阅读来自罗马书第 12 章第 10 到 21 节。

> 要彼此亲爱，彼此尊重，超过自己。要常常热心，不可懒惰，常常服侍主。要在希望中喜乐，在患难中忍耐，常常祷告。要与有需要的神的子民分享，实践款待。要祝福那些迫害你的人，祝福而不是诅咒。与喜乐的人同乐，与哀哭的人同哭。要彼此和睦相处。不要骄傲，而要愿意与卑微的人交往。不要自以为聪明。不要以恶报恶，而要在众人眼中小心行善。若可能的话，尽量与所有人和睦相处。不要报仇，朋友们，而要给神的愤怒留有余地，因为经上记着：'报应在我，我必报应，'主说。相反，如果你的敌人饿了，给他吃；如果他渴了，给他喝。在这样做时，你会在他的头上堆炭火。不要被恶所胜，而要以善胜恶。

这是神的话。

### 耐心的原则

在加拉太书第 5 章第 22 节中，列出了圣灵的果实。这些是超自然改变的心的标志，爱、喜乐、和平、耐心等等。每周我们都在研究这些特质之一，以便我们自己能体验到更多的超自然改变的心。今晚我们将探讨耐心的主题。

如果你曾经读过像《钦定版》这样的旧英文翻译，你会知道，当你读到加拉太书 5:22 的列表时，它是爱、喜乐、和平、耐心。但在旧的英文翻译中，它会说长久忍耐。旧翻译之所以这么说，是因为希腊语中的耐心字面意思是长时间受苦，这听起来不太有希望，但它所说的是，这是圣经对耐心的理解。

**耐心是你能够在困难中承受而不放弃或陷入苦涩的特质。**

听到了吗？耐心是在困难情况下承受而不放弃或陷入苦涩。因此，有两种耐心。有一种是在困难情况下的耐心，我们上周在谈论苦难中的和平时实际上已经讨论过了。但另一种耐心是在困难的人际关系中表现出的耐心和恩典，对人有耐心。

这就是这段经文，这段你刚刚听到的经文，是一段非凡的经文，它谈到了如何对反对你的人表现出耐心和恩典。它将给我们一个原则，一些关于如何实践它的想法，在困难的人面前表现出耐心和恩典，最后它将告诉我们如何获得力量去做到这一点。

有原则，有实践，然后是对反对你的人表现出耐心和恩典的力量。

### 耐心的实践

让我们先看看原则，这里我们谈论的是一系列的人。在光谱的一端是那些不太喜欢你的人，他们没有伤害你，他们只是对你不太喜欢，他们不与你合作，他们有点反对你，他们可能是工作中的人或你的组织中的人。这些人只是没有真正与你合作或帮助你，然后在光谱的中间，你有那些伤害你的人，他们伤害了你，他们对你做了不公正的事情，他们以某种方式欺骗了你，而在光谱的另一端，最远的一端是迫害者，迫害者不仅仅是伤害了你，他们是针对你的，他们想降低你的生活质量。他们想看到你受到伤害，因此在从那些只是反对你并让你感到恼火的人到迫害你的人之间的整个光谱上，我们应该如何回应？

我告诉你，回应是什么，心的默认模式是非自愿的，当人们伤害你时，你会报复，当人们伤害你时，你会报复，你不会坐下来思考，我想我会报复，它只是发生了，你知道，如果你想知道人心是什么样的，西格蒙德·弗洛伊德说，人必须原谅自己的敌人，最好是在他们被绞死之后，这是另一种说法，当然我会原谅他们，一旦我杀了他们，然后我会原谅他们，这就是人心的运作方式，但这不是原则，这里提出的原则是什么？

它在第 17 和 21 节中，它令人震惊，令人惊讶。在这一点上，顺便说一下，基督教与其他所有宗教，所有其他伦理体系不同，事实上基督教，没有文化或社会相信这一点，每当基督教出现在一个社会或文化中，大家都认为他们疯了，这就是原则是什么，第 17 节，不要以恶报恶，然后第 21 节，不要被恶所胜，而要以善胜恶，现在你把这些放在一起，这就是它所说的，克服这个词是一个军事词，它意味着压倒，意味着击败，这就是它所说的，如果当有人伤害你，伤害你时，你只是伤害他们，当有人侮辱你，辱骂你时，你辱骂他们，当他们伤害你而你伤害他们时，你已经被恶所击败，你输了，你被它压倒了，你成为了问题的一部分，你自己也变得邪恶。

### 耐心的力量

也许那个伤害你的人并不是故意想以这种方式伤害你，但重点是你刚刚给了施害者他或她想要的东西，如果你以恶报恶，你已经被恶所击败，唯一击败恶的方法是以善胜恶，这是什么意思，这就是它的意思，如果有人伤害你，如果你不以宽恕、善良和恩典的回答来回应，并且愿意他们的好，而不是愿意他们的伤害，而是愿意他们的好，如果你不宽恕他们，做出善良和恩典的回应，并愿意他们的好，你已经被恶所击败，你已经被击败，你成为了问题的一部分，你自己也变得邪恶。

怎么会这样？顺便说一下，暂时，我们会在一秒钟内谈到这一点。愿意其他人的意思是什么，看到，以恶报恶意味着我想看到他们受伤，我想让他们像我一样受苦，我想把他们拉下来，实际上有两种方式以恶报恶，一种是出去自己制造痛苦的情况，另一种是坐着不做任何事情但反对他们，希望，期望那个糟糕的情况和那个条件，并且每当你看到他们不快乐时，你就会说，是的，看到，现在你仍然在以恶报恶，你仍然愿意恶，你仍然希望它，你要么在进行报复，要么希望你能报复，因此这就是以恶报恶，如果你这样做，你已经被恶所击败，你已经被击败。

怎么会这样？我给你一个快速的三个。首先是，如果你保持愤怒，如果你保持在报复模式中，甚至不报复，但你只是保持愤怒，保持对某人的苦涩，首先，它扭曲并毒害了你所有的关系。你可能认为，通常发生的事情是那些对某人保持愤怒的人觉得，他们觉得自己在完成某事。实际上他们所做的一切只是扎根。如果你，例如，假设你是一个男人，一个女人伤害了你，你对那个女人保持愤怒，这将扭曲并影响你与其他所有女性的关系，当然反之亦然，或者是其他种族、其他阶级或其他国籍的人，或者只是人，人伤害你，你恨他们，你不再信任人，它毒害了你的关系，它扭曲了你，不要，不要以为它没有。

其次，它不仅伤害你的关系，它还伤害你，因为对你来说最糟糕的事情是被推离福音为你想要的东西。看，福音理解世界上最糟糕的事情，实际上世界的问题是自我中心和自以为是。自以为是说，我比其他人好，自我中心说，我比任何人都重要。首先是我，首先是我，自以为是说，我比这些人好，或者这些人。你认为战争从哪里来？你认为我们所有的问题从哪里来？这就是它的来源。福音的全部意义是摧毁你的自以为是，摧毁这个想法，即你比其他人好。告诉你，你是一个被恩典拯救的罪人，但如果你对某人保持愤怒，你正在提升你心中的自以为是，因为当你对某人生气时，你滋养这个想法，你受到了如此大的伤害，你是那个高尚的人受到了伤害。它正在把你变成一个自我中心、自怜、自我吸收的人，能够更残忍，你看不到吗？邪恶正在获胜。

你知道，我没有甲状腺，原因是，你知道，如果你是一个年轻人，你的甲状腺被切除，它会留下一个伤疤。如果你是一个老年人，你的甲状腺被切除，它只是另一个皱纹。所以我可以穿这个，看。但如果你仔细看，你会看到我没有甲状腺，这意味着我必须服用替代甲状腺激素的药片。我必须服用药片来替代它，因为我没有甲状腺。但我多年前学到，如果我服用钙，或者即使我在服用药片时喝钙强化的橙汁或牛奶，钙实际上破坏了我身体吸收甲状腺的能力。如果你服用了你的福音药片，应该消除你的自我中心和自以为是，但你保持怨恨，你从你的福音药片中得不到任何东西，你听到了吗？

不仅报复和苦涩伤害你的关系和你的心，但当然它也摧毁了伤害者。如果一个人伤害你，你还击他们，你所做的一切只是加强他们的错误，加强他们的行为。你让他们认为，你没有让他们说，你知道，如果有人伤害你，然后你只是打击他们，他们会说，我看到了我的错误，没有。我说，我这样做是对的。当然，不仅你只是创造了这个侮辱和侮辱的循环，伤害和伤害的循环，但你也疏远了他们的朋友，虽然邪恶正在获胜。如果你不宽恕，如果你不以恩典和善良回应，如果你不以愿意那个人的好回应，邪恶就会获胜。施害者实际上获胜，也许不是他想的那样，你成为了世界问题的一部分。

那么我们如何做到这一点？顺便说一下，那个原则，你只能以善胜恶，让我们不要跳到，好吧，你知道，让我们不要谈论国家，好吗？你知道，中国做什么，美国做什么，欧洲做什么，如果你受到攻击？我一次只能讲一个道理，好吗？这是关于你的。但我想让你知道，这个想法，你只能以善胜恶，是一个深刻的圣经主题。实际上，如果有人看过任何《指环王》电影或读过《指环王》书，你知道，故事《指环王》，你知道它主要是关于什么？它是关于这个想法，有一个戒指，谁戴上戒指可以统治世界，它是由一个邪恶的领主制造的，但如果你用戒指对抗邪恶的领主，你自己会成为一个邪恶的领主。因此，唯一杀死邪恶领主和摧毁邪恶领主的方法不是用力量，而是用软弱和牺牲。这是一个深刻的圣经主题，你看不到吗？这就是为什么当耶稣基督来时，他不是来带来审判。他来承受审判。

所以这就是原则。第一，第二，实践。实际上有很多非常非常实用的方法来做到这一点。如果你说，好吧，所以有人伤害了我。现在，我该怎么办？我该如何以善胜恶？让我从文本中给你五个实用的想法。

1. **祝福**：第 14 节，祝福那些迫害你的人。这个词祝福可能意味着为他们祈祷，祈求神的祝福。但即使这不是它在这里的意思，我们知道耶稣在马太福音 5 中说，为那些迫害你的人祈祷。记住，这是光谱的这一端，迫害。想想看。为那些迫害你的人祈祷。记住我们说过，有那些不喜欢你的人，那些伤害你的人，迫害者？现在，这太实用了。你真的不能恨你正在为之祈祷的人。你只是不能为他们祈祷并同时恨他们。事实上，即使你说，哦，主，打开那些白痴的眼睛，我只是想让你知道你刚刚转了一个角。你在为他们祈祷。你愿意他们的好。祈祷让你做到。这是一种纪律。

2. **宽恕**：除了祈祷，你应该总是宽恕。这是它所说的，它所说的，不要以恶报恶。朋友们，不要报仇。不要报仇。这意味着不要在生活中报仇，也不要在心中报仇。我听过很多人说，我原谅了他们，但我不会忘记。通常这意味着我不试图在外面伤害他们。我不在外面报仇，但我在心里报仇。我不认为大多数纽约人意识到他们实际上在练习巫术。这是一种心理巫术。换句话说，你在心里放小针在一个小娃娃上，希望它能伤害他们。你坐在那里反对他们。这会毒害你。它会做我们说过的所有事情。那么你该怎么办？你如何宽恕？宽恕是在感觉之前给予的。我在这里听到很多人说，我不能原谅他们。我对他们生气。我说，不，你对他们生气是因为你不愿意原谅他们。这是什么意思？它的意思是你只是基本上克制。你克制不去刺他们。你克制不去重播你的录音，思考他们所做的一切。你克制不去在外面报复，但你也克制不去在心里报复，只是你克制你的复仇幻想。你克制你想看到他们发生的事情。当你的思想开始运转时，你就转过来。你在感觉之前给予它，但你给予它。

3. **不要避开他们**：我喜欢第 18 节。如果可能的话，尽量与所有人和睦相处。这意味着他们可能不想见你。他们可能会避开你。很好。你无法控制这一点。看看这有多现实。但它确实说，尽量与他们保持关系。我有些人对我说，哦，我原谅了他们，我在为他们祈祷，但我不想与他们有任何关系。你可能的意思是我通过撤回我的友谊来惩罚他们。这仍然是惩罚。你说，我原谅了他们。我不报复。我只是不想与他们有任何关系。你认为那是什么？那是报复。如果他们不想避开你，你不要避开他们。

4. **愿他们的好**：这是什么意思？这里说，如果你的敌人饿了，给他吃；如果他渴了，给他喝。现在，这意味着什么？它必须意味着不一定你必须真的给他们一顿饭。这意味着在你可能的每种方式中，你寻求愿他们的好。你尽可能地为他们的好做事。我有些人对我说，好吧，如果有人伤害了我，我必须信任他们吗？我说，好吧，这取决于为什么。因为我要向你展示这有多微妙。如果你有一个朋友是酒鬼或瘾君子，你试图成为一个朋友，你爱他们，你试图帮助他们，你知道，保持清醒。你应该信任他们吗？不。如果你，如果你知道，如果你知道任何关于成瘾的事情，当然，你不信任他们。当然，你知道这个人多么容易开始撒谎和复发。因此，如果你爱你的朋友，你可能不会完全信任他们。但缺乏信任，保留信任，是你帮助他们的一种方式。但你知道，也有可能以不信任某人的方式伤害他们。他们只是拒绝让他们改变，只是拒绝看到他们可能在成长。所以当有人说，我必须信任他们吗，答案是，再次，不，事实上，可能如果有人伤害了你，你不应该信任他们。但这是为什么，因为你想看到他们成长，你不想让他们继续犯罪变得容易。

5. **谦卑地反对他们**：现在，这是一个曲线球，但这是基督教，它只是惊人。你看到这个地方，它说，如果你的敌人饿了，给他吃，如果他渴了，给他喝。在这样做时，你会在他的头上堆炭火。好吧，这是一个甜美的小形象，不是吗？这到底是什么意思？实际上，我必须告诉你，有相当多的争论，相当多。但它可能意味着这个。如果你在一个被围困的城市中，有一支军队在那里试图攻占你的城市，而你在保卫你的城市，你可以保卫城市的方法之一是你走到城墙上，倒一些热液体或燃烧的液体在攻击的人身上。你知道，我想，他们告诉我，如果你的头发着火了，很难使用你的剑。当你的头发着火时，很难瞄准得很好。所以，当你在头上倒炭火时，你在做什么？他们不攻击。因此，看看这里的悖论。如果一个人正在伤害你，你确实阻止他们。你确实反对他们。你确实阻止攻击。事实上，你可能甚至以一种相当痛苦的方式做到这一点。然而，看看上下文。如果你的敌人饿了，给他吃，如果你的敌人渴了，这里有一种反对和爱的混合。你反对他们是为了他们的好。你反对他们是因为这是他们的食物和饮料。事实上，看看第 16 节。要彼此和睦相处。不要骄傲。不要自以为是。在箴言 15 和 25 中，有两个我喜欢的箴言。它说，温柔的回答能消除愤怒。严厉的回答激起愤怒。现在，当你看到这一点，温柔的回答意味着温柔和恩典。当你第一次看到这一点，这意味着好。你不回嘴。但然后它在箴言 25:11 中说，温柔的话可以折断骨头。它所说的是，你想说服人吗？你真的想改变人吗？如果一个人犯罪，如果一个人伤害你，你必须反对他们。为什么？最不爱的事情就是让一个人继续犯罪。这是非常不爱的。所以你试图反对他们。你试图阻止他们。但你温柔地做到这一点。你恩典地做到这一点。你谦卑地做到这一点。你清楚地表明你试图给他们食物和饮料，这意味着这是你知道你做对了的方法。如果你去找一个伤害你的人，并且你以一种方式告诉他们他们做错了什么，那个人坐在那里说，我不喜欢这个人说的话。我甚至不认为我同意。但很明显这个人关心我。那么有 50，50 的机会这个人可能真的会改变。但我告诉你一些事情。如果你去面对他们并反对他们，并且你说，我在寻求真理。我在寻求正义。并且很明显你面对的那个人，你喜欢对抗。你享受它。你在贬低他们。你在惩罚他们。你不是为了真理而做的。你不是为了上帝而做的。你是为了你自己而做的。你不是为了他或她而做的。因此，如果你反对而没有首先宽恕和祝福和祈祷和爱和谦卑，如果你反对而没有所有这些其他事情，你永远不会看到邪恶，你知道，退缩。你永远不会让那个人真正看到他或她的错误。我知道很多人非常自豪他们使用严厉的语言。他们是粗鲁的。他们总是非常直率。结果，因为他们的话不是温柔和温和的，没有人被说服。他们觉得这很好。我一直在为真理而勇敢，这意味着他们不关心真理，因为他们关心真理。他们会以一种人们可以被说服的方式说出来，以便人们被说服。相反，他们喜欢人们被冒犯的事实。他们喜欢人们对他们感到不满的事实。这让他们感到非常高尚。他们拍自己的背。这是邪恶。这是以恶报恶创造的自以为是。不，不。你需要在你告诉他们他们做错了什么之前宽恕他们。你需要为他们祈祷。你需要不避开他们。你需要愿他们的好。当你去和他们谈论他们的错误时，你需要谦卑地做到这一点，但你也必须做到。你不能让人们轻易地对你犯罪。这对他们来说是最糟糕的事情。你看不到这有多奇怪吗？几乎我认识的每个人，要么愤怒地面对，要么借口并保持沉默。哦，不要制造波浪。说，爱，保持沉默，愤怒，保持张开嘴，但我们应该爱并保持张开嘴。没有人这样做，这把我们带到了最后一点。

### 耐心的力量

你从哪里获得力量？好吧，现在，乍一看，你可能认为你从严格的激励中获得力量，因为在第 19 节中，上帝说，字面上说，不要报仇，朋友们，而要给神的愤怒留有余地。它是我的报复。我会报应，主说。不要报仇。现在，上帝说了什么？你知道他在说什么吗？从我的椅子上下来。只有我有权利和能力坐在审判席上。事实上，看看那，看看那，它说，给神的愤怒留有余地。这不是很有趣吗？这就是我们在说的。这就是上帝对你说的。他在说，你真的不知道这个人应得什么。你不知道。你坐在那里，你在想象应该发生在那个人身上的事情。你不知道。听，听，你知道，我经常这样说，当有人对你撒谎时，你对他们生气，你说什么？骗子。但如果你对某人撒谎，你会撒谎吗？是的。好吧，为什么你撒谎？好吧，这很复杂。你看，伤害你的人是一个一维的卡通人物。他只是一个骗子。但当你撒谎时，好吧，这很复杂。有这些情有可原的情况。有这个和那个。我的母亲不爱我。还有各种各样的事情。但猜猜看？现实在中间。看，当你对某人生气时，上帝看着你，我想说，你不知道那个人经历了什么。你不知道他们的背景是什么。你不知道那个人过了什么样的一天。你不知道他们与母亲的关系是什么。你不知道这些事情。只有我知道那个人应得什么。所以从我的椅子上下来。

但我们不能以这种方式结束这篇讲道，因为那不会给我们力量。它有点让我们谦卑，并说，是的，我应该从椅子上下来。但这就是你获得力量以善胜恶的地方。这是在反对面前的耐心和恩典。它来自上帝的怜悯。有趣的是？我不能这样做。这是打印文本的问题。实际上，第 12 章在开头开始，保罗说，我劝你们在上帝的怜悯面前，在上帝的怜悯面前。我劝你们，然后他给出了所有这些，剩下的章节，是关于如何生活的各种期望。因此，他在这里所说的一切只能在上帝的怜悯面前完成。现在，他本可以说因为上帝的怜悯，那会有效，但他使用了视图这个词。视图是一个令人惊叹的体验。全景。这就是保罗在说的。如果你想以善胜恶，你必须对上帝对你的怜悯有一个全景的惊人视图。

有趣的是，耶稣谈论宽恕最多的地方，怜悯是他帮助我们宽恕的核心。让我通过告诉你他在马太福音 18 中给出的比喻来结束。这是一个非常现代的比喻。有一个国王，他有一个仆人，仆人欠国王一万他连得。评论员总是对这个数字感到惊讶，因为它真的意味着数十亿和数万亿美元。这是一个荒谬的金额。因此，它不可能意味着，因此，贷款。没有国王可能给任何仆人一万他连得。这一定意味着仆人是王国中的高级官员，通过管理不善和渎职，他损失了大量的钱，因此整个经济和整个王国都处于危险之中。听起来熟悉吗？现代的。因此，国王来到仆人面前说，我的钱在哪里？还给我。仆人说，我不能原谅我和国王，虽然他有权坐在审判席上，原谅他。他对他有怜悯。

然后那个仆人走过来，看到第二个仆人。那个第二个仆人欠第一个仆人，被原谅的仆人，几美元。第一个仆人说，还给我，第二个仆人说，我没有。我没有。原谅我。这个第一个仆人说不，把他们扔进监狱。当国王听到这个，他抓住第一个仆人，他说，你不应该像我对你有怜悯一样对你的同伴仆人有怜悯吗？你没有看到我的怜悯吗？国王说，你没有看到我的怜悯吗？你没有体验到我的怜悯吗？怎么会有人体验到我的怜悯还对他们的同伴仆人怀有怨恨呢？然后，在比喻的结尾，他把第一个仆人扔进监狱，然后耶稣以他令人毛骨悚然的台词结束。所以如果你不从心里原谅你的弟兄，我的天父也会这样对你。你知道这意味着什么吗？你唯一可以在灵性上迷失的方式是如果你拒绝相信你是一个需要恩典拯救的罪人。根据圣经，你唯一可以在灵性上迷失的方式是通过骄傲，是说，我不需要施舍。你只能通过不相信拒绝相信你是一个需要严格通过恩典拯救的罪人而迷失。那么，等一下。耶稣在说什么？这就是他在说的，如果你怀有怨恨，如果你对某人报复，那么即使你说你相信你是一个被恩典拯救的罪人，你也不相信。无论你说什么，你都在否认。这是我们的写照。最，最不协调的是你有一个仆人像国王和法官一样行事。一个仆人，没有，进监狱，当一个仆人像国王或法官一样行事时，这是不协调的。但这就是你和我。这就是为什么我们对彼此生气。这就是为什么我们互相报复。这就是为什么我们坐在审判席上。我们是像国王和法官一样行事的仆人。什么会改变我们的心？唯一能改变一个仆人不再像国王一样行事的东西是通过看到国王成为仆人的惊人爱。我们应该在码头。我们把自己放在审判席上，但坐在审判席上的主下来，把自己放在码头上，他走上了十字架。全地的审判者被审判。他为我们受罚，以便他为我们彼此伤害的所有方式承担我们应得的惩罚。这就是会给你所需的宽恕。福音，如果你相信它，如果你看到它，这就是主的晚餐的意义，如果你看到怜悯，它让你谦卑。你不能对某人生气，除非你觉得自己比他们优越。所以它让你从苦涩中谦卑下来，但它也让你从苦涩中得到肯定，因为它说，你不必为自己辩护。我在耶稣基督里被称义。我不必为自己辩护。我不必为自己辩护。我不必担心我的声誉。我不在乎你做了什么。然后你可以宽恕。

你知道，我知道有些人会说，有时候你必须，你知道，人们会说，你必须说出真相。当然你必须。你必须坚强。你必须坚强。当然你必须。但当耶稣基督在十字架上死去，因为他在路加福音 23:34 中被不公正地执行时，他实际上说，父啊，原谅他们。他们不知道他们在做什么。你会在我们结束时考虑一下吗？父啊，原谅他们。他们不知道他们在做什么。你看到平衡了吗？首先，他说，父啊，他们所做的是错的。他们需要被原谅。他们有罪。我为他们的罪而死。但看看它。他的行刑者，而不是对他们大喊大叫和尖叫，你会得到你的。他说什么？父啊，他们真的不了解他们在做什么的严重性。耶稣对他的行刑者有好话要说。看看那种平衡。如果他这样对待他的行刑者，你和我怎么敢对人冷漠和退缩，或讽刺和侮辱和砍杀和烧毁人？我们怎么敢这样说话？他甚至在最后也不会这样说话。

哦主，赐给我们恩典和耐心，这只能从对你拯救怜悯的伟大视野中成长出来。

让我们祷告。父啊，主的晚餐是我们获得你怜悯视野的时刻。赐给我们你怜悯的视野，以便我们可以以善胜恶。主，不是每个人在这个房间里现在都在与我们斗争，但很多人是。每个人都会需要这个。所以赐给我们我们所需的力量。在你怜悯的视野中，以善胜恶。我们奉耶稣的名祷告。
