## English Transcript / 英文原文

today's teaching, Tim Keller unpacks how Jesus actively seeks us, reveals truth to  us, and calls us to Himself. Let me read from Luke, chapter 24, it's printed in your bulletin. It's very end of the Gospel of Luke, verses 44 to 53, okay, and he said to them,  this is what I told you while I was still with you. Everything must be fulfilled. That is written about me in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the Psalms.

Then he opened their minds so that they could understand the scriptures. He told them, this is what is written. The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day. And repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in His name to all nations, beginning  at Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things.

I am going to send you what my father has promised, but stay in the city until you have been  clothed with power from on high. And when he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethlehem, he lifted up his hands and blessed  them. And while he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven. And then they worshipped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy. And they stayed continually in the temple, praising God.

This is God's word. Now many people today think of Christianity as a set of beliefs that you take up, something  you decide upon. Here's a set of beliefs, here's a set of ethical guidelines, and you take them up. You pick them up. You've decided this is what I want to do.

This is what I want to be. The Bible, however, describes Christianity in very different terms, almost opposite terms. The Bible says that Christianity is not something that you choose so much. Oh, there's a choice involved. It's something that comes upon you.

It's not something that picks you up. It's not something that you pick up. It's something that picks you up. It's not something that you take up. It's something that takes you up.

It's not something that you just decide to do, but rather it's always something that comes  at you. It's a force, and you do make a choice. You do make a choice, but it's always in response to something that you feel is arguing  with you. Something you feel is coming after you. Something that you feel is seeking you out, always.

What is it? It sounds mysterious, doesn't it? I tell you that you don't know real Christianity, boy, it sounds so arrogant, but it is true. I tell you, you don't understand real Christianity unless you've had that same sense. The sense of something having come after you, something arguing with you, something grabbing  you by the neck, something making you think about things that you don't really want to  think, helping you see things that you've never really seen before, unless you sense that  something is coming upon you and picking you up and taking you up, and in response to  that, you have to make a decision and in response to that, unless that's happening, you  haven't really experienced real Christianity.

It sounds so exotic, doesn't it, thrilling, mysterious? What is it? What is it that comes after you? I'll tell you what it is. It's Jesus Christ the Revealer.

What we're looking at today, and what we see depicted here, is that Jesus Christ is not  a passive Savior. Jesus is not depicted by the Bible as somebody who has died on the cross to deal with guilt  and to deal with evil, and then he sort of sits back and he waits for you to figure it  out. It doesn't do that at all. Instead, he comes after us. He is not just a priest, he's a prophet, he's not just a Redeemer, he's a Revealer.

He's not just someone who makes a provision for us, but he comes and he tells us about it. He comes after us. It's him. This passage tells us that after the resurrection, he comes to his disciples and opens their  mind up. And the Bible tells us that that continues to happen today, that through the Holy Spirit  he comes after us.

What am I talking about? It's what Jesus says in the book of John when he says, you have not chosen me, I have  chosen you. Or it's what Jesus says in Matthew 11 where he says, no one knows the Father, but the Son. And the one to whom ever the Son chooses to reveal him. Let me say that again.

No one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. See Jesus says, I'm the Revealer, I come to you, I let you in, I show you the Father. It's very natural, and yet I'll try to show you here in the next 60 seconds, it's illogical,  but it's very natural to say in our modern day, that's not fair, that's so narrow-minded. Why would Jesus say he's the only way to the Father, he's the only one who can reveal? That's not fair, that's not just, that's too narrow, let me ask you a question.

What did people say when Jonas Salk, remember Jonas Salk who came up with a polio vaccine? And Jonas Salk came up and said, I have discovered the only cure for polio or the vaccine for polio. I have discovered it. What did everybody say? Did they say that couldn't be, how unfair, that one scientist would find the cure for polio  and nobody else would?

Is that what happened? Did everybody say, well, that can't be, I mean, why would one scientist know it? Not all scientists, no, everybody knew that if you wanted to get the vaccine for polio,  you had to go to Jonas Salk. If you wanted deliverance, you had to go to him because he alone knew it and he alone could reveal the way out. Why?

There was nobody upset about it, they're upset about Jesus saying, I show you the way to the Father,  they're not upset about Jonas Salk, why? The reason they weren't upset about the polio issue was they knew it wasn't a matter of if it's fair,  just if it's true. It doesn't matter if his claims are just, if they're true,  if he really knew what he said he knew, then he was the way. That's just the way it is. And Jesus says, that's the way it is.

And we're going to try to show you in a minute why he's able to say that. But just to start, introduction,  this is an aspect of the message of the Christian faith, which is very important to know. It's very practical, it's very mysterious. In fact, it's almost romantic, to be honest, there's a romance to it. Christianity is something that comes and gets you,  because Jesus is not simply a king and a redeemer.

He's also a revealer of the hidden. He comes after us, and he shows us the truth. Now, let's take a look at this. Traditionally, and theologically and historically, this is called the prophetic ministry of Christ. The Bible says, Jesus is prophet, priest, and king.

He's a prophet, he's a priest, and a king. And today we're looking at his prophetic ministry. And let me just talk to you about it by looking at this passage where we see him engaged in it. And let's just look at it under three headings. What he does, why he does it, and how he does it.

What, why, how? What, why, and how? I'm saying that, so I remember it. And not so, I don't think you hear it. What, why, and how?

What does he do? He gives us eyes. He gives us eyes. Historically, the church has understood that Jesus' prophetic ministry had two parts. An earthly and a heavenly, or an external and an internal.

Traditionally, the church understands that Jesus Christ came to earth to be a prophet, which means  he comes down to earth, and he becomes a human being, and he teaches us. And he gives us verbal revelation. He tells us things about the word and the will of God. But that's not all he does. The Bible says that's what he did as an earthly prophet in the past,  but now he has a heavenly prophetic ministry in the present when through the Holy  Spirit he comes and he opens our minds to the truth.

So there's a past ministry and a present prophetic ministry, an earthly ministry and a heavenly  ministry, or let me put it another way. The other way to put it is that there's an external, he gives us the external word and  the internal word. The external word. When he came to earth and he taught us, and we have his teaching. Where it is, it's verbal, it's propositional, it's in principles, it's on a piece of paper.

It's wonderful what you have in the Scripture. This great set of verses by George Herbert that is on the title page about the Scripture. What I like so much, he's talking about the Scripture, he says, this is such great poetry. This is the thankful glass that mends the looker's eye. This is the well that washes what it shows.

Who can endure this praise so much? But here's my favorite part, he's talking about the Scripture, he says, heaven lies flat  in thee, subject to every mountain's bended knee. Heaven lies flat. Jesus has put what you need for heaven, the glories of heaven, the glories of the heavenly  realms into propositions, into words. It's there, there it is, the truth.

You might say the external word, heaven lies flat in thee. That's what an interesting way to put it, but Jesus doesn't just do that. He also comes to a spiritually and he gives us the internal word. He alums us to help us understand what's in the external word. You see these two things right here in the passage we just read in verse 44 and 45, there  it is, there's another example of it.

In verse 44, this is after the resurrection, after he's been raised from the dead, he comes  to his disciples and he says, this is what I told you while I was still with you. Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in Moses, the prophets, and the  Psalms. Now when he was with them on earth, he had already taught them the things that he's mentioning  here. He says from the Psalms and from the law and from the prophets, he had taught them a number  of things. So he refers to it.

But then, verse 45, then he opened their mind so that they could understand. It wasn't enough for him just to come the first time, he had to come the second time. It wasn't enough for him to give us the external word. He'd already done that, but now in verse 45, he gives them the internal word. Just to complete the analogy here, there's two ways in which illumination fails to happen  physically.

Either my eye might work, but there'd be no light, or the light may be on, but my eye  doesn't work. Light but no eye, eye but no light. Light is necessary for me to see, even if my eye works, why? Because you see what I see out there and what you see up here. You don't really see me, obviously.

You see, the light reflected off of me, it's bouncing off of me, and it's hitting your  retina, actually. So without light, your eye may work fine, but you won't see what's up here. On the other hand, all the light in the world won't help if your eye is dark, as the Bible  says. If there's something wrong with your eye, if it's not sensitive to stimuli, now you have  to have both, or you don't have illumination. Now, secondly, let's put it another way.

At the non-physical level, you have to have both things in order to have illumination. Let me give you an example. Here's a man and his family life's a mess. In particular, let's say here's a father, and he can't control his daughter, his young  teenage daughter. She's indulged in self-destructive behavior.

She's always antagonistic to him. She's dependent on him and yet she hates him. She's petulant and yet self-destructive and so on. He goes to counseling, and the counselor talks to the daughter, he talks to the father,  he talks to the family, and so on. Finally, the counselor sits down with the father and he says, the main reason why your daughter  is in the condition she's in is you.

The main reason is the way in which you've treated her, the way in which you have let  her completely depend on her. You're always bailing her out. You're never making her, allowing her to experience the consequences of her behavior. A lot of you know what I'm talking about here. The counselor lays this out to the father and it's a new idea.

He's never really heard it before. A whole new concept never thought of it. It's light. It's a new concept because the counselor is standing in the shoes of the prophet and the counselor  is bringing the external word, but the counselor is a human being and human beings can only  bring the external word to another human being. Because if the counselor is going to be a success, illumination won't happen unless besides  the new concept, the father has the eyes in the heart to grasp the concept, and you know  that may not happen.

In fact, it probably won't happen for what I know about fathers and what I know about  situations like that. The father is either going to say, here comes the light, here comes the concept, enabling  behavior or whatever you want to call it, and the father says, nonsense. I only do what any father would do. I love my daughter or even, he might even say, oh yes, I agree, but just not get it. Just not sink in.

It doesn't change his behavior. He still is not able to draw the line. He's still not able to put his foot down. He's still not able to give her what she really needs. And it may not be till years later that with tears, illumination finally happens sometimes  when it's too late, sometimes after a terrible tragedy.

And the father says, you know, the counselor years ago told me this, and I agreed with him,  but now I really see, I didn't get it, I didn't see it. You see, there has to both be light and eyes, and this is the glory of Jesus. That counselor is a human counselor. And one human counselor, a human prophet can never do anything else, but give the external  word to another human being. But don't you see for us to get illumination, you've got to have the internal word too.

You have to not only have light, but eyes. And this is the one of the great glories. This is a promise. You know, let me tell you something. This may be true.

It may not be true. Now I think it's true. I would die for it. But I'm saying to you, you know, the listener, this may be true, this may not be true. But there's no other religion, no other faith that even offers this.

You want to know that. Don't you see, this Bible is full of human prophets. And they're great. Men and women who brought the Word of God, they're great. We're glad we have them.

And all the other religions have prophets too. Men and women who bring the Word of God and bring the truth, bring the truth, talk about  reality. That's great. But all they can possibly do, if they're human beings, if they're only prophets,  if they're only human, all they can do is bring the external Word. You know what we need?

We don't just need a counselor. We need a wonderful counselor. Mighty God, Prince of Peace. See the great thing about Jesus is that he's not only a human prophet. He's a divine prophet.

He's not only human, he's also God. He not only brings us the external Word, but he then brings us the internal Word. He not only gives us the light, but he gives us the eyes, and that's no other prophet  can do that. No other prophet can even offer it. He opened their minds so that they could understand the things that he had told them.

Isn't that great? The greatest thing that Paul could ask for his friends and Ephesians, he prays to the Lord  for what? He says, I'm praying to the Lord. He says in Ephesians 118, that the eyes of your heart would be enlightened so that you  can know the things that I've told you, so you can grasp them. Paul knew his limitations.

He was a human prophet only, and everybody in this room we desperately need not just  a human prophet. That's enough. Let me tell you something. Every other philosophy, anybody who sells you a philosophy or sells you a religion that  doesn't have both the external and the internal Word, both the light and the eyes is passing  you bad money. That's what's the glory of this faith here.

You see, you've got plenty of religions and philosophies that simply give you the rules. They say, there it is, the external Word. Now try your best. Do it. Do it.

And then you've got other kinds of faith and religions that are all internal Word. It's all mystical. You look into yourself. You look at your navel. We can't tell you what to do.

You have to look inside yourself and get in touch with your own self and your own feelings. You see, you've got religions that have the internal Word only, and they're just a  morass of subjective mysticism, and you've got religions that have the external Word only,  but not this. This is Christianity. This may be true. This may not be true.

I'm telling you. But nobody else offers this. A redeemer who's a prophet. A prophet who's a redeemer, you see, a man who's a God, a God who's a man. And therefore he comes and he opens our minds as well as teaches us both.

Now why does he do it? So that's what he does. He gives his eyes. And secondly, why does he do it? And the reason he does it is because we're spiritually blind.

Let's take a moment to define that. The reason we need this is because he's spiritually blind. In verse 45, it says, when he opened their minds, so they could understand the scriptures,  the Word opened is significant. As you know, this was originally written in Greek, and the Word opened is a translation  of a particular Greek word. There were two different Greek words that could be used here.

One is a noigo, one is dia noigo. A little word dia is the word for through. Now a noigo means to open something like a door, something that's already got a latch,  something that's already got a provision for opening. So you use the Greek word a noigo with a door, but the word dia noigo doesn't just simply  mean to open. It means to break open.

It means to bust open. It means to break in. It wouldn't use the word dia noigo with a door unless it was a locked door. You use the word dia noigo with something like a mountain. I open the mountain with my tunnel, you see.

It means to break through two different Greek words. Which one do you think Luke uses? You just take a guess. He will not talk about the human mind or the human soul, like a door. He talks about the human mind or the human soul, like a mountain, layers and layers of obstacles  to the truth, impenetrable.

What Luke is saying is that the natural human mind until Jesus gets to it is spiritually  blind. It's blind. Now what does that mean? You know, one illustration you can use is you think of the eye itself. Very often as a person gets older, something develops on the eye called a cataract.

And a cataract is a clouding up or a misting up an opaqueness that develops where there  should be transparency. That's a perfect analogy, a much better analogy than other kinds of analogies, to explain  the human soul. God made the human soul with a transparency. We are different than the animals. We are different than the plants.

We honor the animals and we honor the plants as part of God's creation. But they're not in the image of God. What does that mean? They don't have a spiritual faculty. They don't have a capacity for truth.

They don't have a capacity for reason, but they don't have a capacity for a real personal  connection with Jesus, with God. And yet the Bible says, naturally because of sin, there is an opaqueness over top of  our soul, so that it has to be broken through. Another way to put it is we have cataracts on our soul. And you know what? You can rub your eye all you want that will not get rid of cataracts.

You can rub it and rub it and rub it and rub it. You can wash it and wash it and wash it, that will not get rid of cataracts, there needs  to be an intervention. There needs to be a medical intervention. Somebody that has skills that you don't have, there needs to be a surgeon. That's exactly what Jesus is.

The reason He's a prophet, not just a human prophet. See the idea, if you think all you need is the truth. You say, well, I just need somebody to inform me, that's all I need. You don't realize the depth of your blindness. You don't just need the light, you need eyes, but you need someone to take the opaqueness  off.

That's what the surgeon does. That's what the medical intervention does. And that's what you need more than anything else. Now you say, what do you mean by opaqueness? What is it?

Very, very important, listen carefully. The spiritual blindness is not a lack of reason. It's very possible for a person who is totally spiritually blind to read the Bible and accept  it, to say, yes, I see that Jesus died for my sins. I think that's great. I like that.

That's important. I believe it. It's not, to be spiritually blind doesn't mean that you can't intellectually comprehend something  from the Bible. In fact, it's natural and normal for people when they become Christians to say, last year  I became a Christian, but there was never a time in my life where I didn't actually believe  in the basic propositions of the Christian faith. It's very typical for a person to say, I became a Christian last year, but there was never  a time in which I didn't believe in the resurrection.

I didn't believe in the crucifixion. I didn't believe in the basic propositions of the Christian faith. People wouldn't, what do they mean when they say they became a Christian? Here's what they mean. The opaqueness is not an inability to comprehend.

It's not an inability to reason. It's not a rational inability. It's not some kind of operation of the mind. Jean Piaget talks about the various operations that develop as a kid gets older. You have sensory motor development, you have six stages of it and you have concrete operations  and abstract operations.

He's talking about the various sorts of mental abilities and operations, logical operations  and transactions that you do mentally. When we talk about spiritual blindness, we're not saying, we're talking about any of that. Spiritual blindness is not the inability to see the truth, but it's the inability to  value it, to appreciate it. Now the problem with that word is in English, appreciate is a fairly wimpy word. We appreciate you and there's a song where it says, Lord, we appreciate you and it sounds  I've ever sung it.

It sounds so wimpy. We appreciate you, but it's not. It's a good word and here's why and I'm going to keep with it and this is the heart of  what this opaqueness is and what spiritual blindness is. The word deep appreciate means something loses its value, therefore it loses its economic  power, it loses its clout, it loses its how much it can influence. You get a diamond, it's valuable.

What does that mean? You can do things with that. You can get things done with it, there's value to it. You have a diamond and you can go places, you can do things. You can get things for it, that's valuable.

When something deep appreciates it loses value, when something appreciates it gains value,  but the word appreciate in the English language can also mean that what increases is your  realization of the value of something, your realization of the power of something, your  realization of the influence of something. When a person says, I became a Christian last year, though I always believed intellectually  in the Bible and intellectually in the Christian faith, but last year I saw. What does it mean? What does she mean when she talks like that? Here's what she means.

I always knew Jesus died for me, says a new Christian, but I never realized that I need  to know that Jesus loves me more than anything else in the world. I need to know that deep down underneath that I didn't believe that I'm loved, but when  I one day, last year, I realized that what Jesus did for me is the thing that I need most  of all. It revolutionized me when I realized that when I saw the value of what he's done for me,  I suddenly realized I don't have to be like this, I don't have to be like this. This is the root of all my problems. Now, that kind of language means that the cataracts have come off.

She saw, but she didn't see. You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger brother. In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who  try to earn his love by being good. In his book, The prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart  of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental  older brother and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal, extravagant grace. Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith, The prodigal God will help  you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way.

The prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel in life share  the hope and joy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the world.

If some of you stock analyst types, if suppose I could send you back in a time machine  but there's nothing that a stock analyst would rather have than a trip back about five  years. Isn't that right?

Just go back five years, ten years, whatever, send you back and you sit down. You're back in time now and you sit down with the Wall Street Journal and you start to  read the stock stuff and you're sitting alongside of your stock analyst friends and of course,  they're there from their own time and they don't know what you know. They don't know anything about the future and you're going down a list and all of a sudden  you come to Microsoft and you say, oh my gosh, it's selling for that. If I buy a thousand shares of that, I'll be a quadrillion zillionaire in seven years. I will do everything I can.

See, I'm going to borrow, I'm going to beg, I'm going to do anything I can to buy everything  I'll put. How do you know? You know what they don't know. They go down all these little lines and one of them jumps out at you says Microsoft, why? You can appreciate it.

You know the value of it. You know the influence of that information. There's information on that line. Nobody else can see what it means. Nobody else can see the significance of the information.

Nobody can see that knowing that will make all the difference. They can't appreciate it. They're blind. They don't have eyes, you see, but you do. What does it mean to become a Christian?

It means to look at stuff that you've looked at for years and suddenly it jumps out  of you and you say, what's the matter with me? How could I have never seen the power of this? How could I have never seen the meaning of this? How could I have never seen the value of this? That's what the spiritual blindness is.

I know there's people in this room who say, well, of course I'm a Christian, I've always  believed. And yet that's never happened to you. You have no idea what that experience is like. And you're blind. You're spiritually blind.

You need to have someone break through, say, break through, the anoint go, open some years  ago. There were two women that I was counseling back in my first church in a little town and  I didn't know much about counseling. They both came to me within a week of each other and they had the same problem. They were facing a very devastating loss in their lives. And they came to a pastor.

Actually, there was no counselors in town, so people came to pastors back then because  there was nobody else to talk to about their problems. And they came on in at various times. In both cases, I laid out a passage of Scripture and then I gave them a book, the same passage,  the same book, the same basic theme. And a couple of, maybe a month later, I saw both of them and the one woman came back and  said, you know what? She says, when I began to see what God has given me and what I have in Jesus, I began  to realize, if I have that, then I can bear the loss of this.

And I could see she was healing. And the other woman, same age, same situation, same Bible passage, same book. She came back and she says, yeah, well, that's very nice. And I guess I believe it. But what good is that if I have lost the thing that I've lost?

She was inconsolable and she was broken from what I can tell permanently. What was the difference between them? Illumination, the same truth, but the one woman was able to appreciate the truth. She was able to see the value of the truth. She was able to sense the power of the truth and the other woman did not.

Let me tell you what illumination means. You say, I want peace, friends, until the goodness of God is more real to you than all of the threats  around you. You will never have peace. You'll be worried sick. You say, I wish I could forgive the person who's hurt me until the forgiveness of God is  more real to you than all of the injustice that's been done to you.

You will never be able to overcome your bitterness. It's a matter of illumination. It's a matter of appreciation of the truth because we're blind. And only as we break through, you want to overcome guilt, the truth has got to break through  of what he's done for you. You want to overcome worry, the truth has got to break through of how good he is.

You want to deal with boredom, the truth has got to break through and so on and so on. You're blind. We're blind. Okay. That's what he's done.

He gives us eyes. Why he's done it? Because we're blind. Lastly, how he's done it, and I guess I have to be brief about this, though I've already  in a sense answered your question, that issue. How does he do it?

How does he deal with the opaqueness? How does he break through the blindness? And the answer is, it's pretty mysterious, but there's one word here that gives us a  bit of a clue. It says, then he opened their minds so they could understand the scriptures. And the word understand is a Greek word, Sunet-Me, which literally means to assemble a puzzle.

And that's the best clue I can give you, look, if I lay 20 pieces of a puzzle out at  random on a table, and you look at it, but then I assemble it, put it into places. And then you look at it. What's the difference? Well, you know, it's the same 20 pieces. You're actually not looking at one bit of different content.

It's the same content, the same 20 things. But once I put them together, you see the connection. And see, to me, I think that's probably the key principle as to what is to how Jesus  does this. This is all very mysterious. Very long, listen, if you were raised in a Muslim country and you've never heard anything  about Christianity and you come here and you start to listen and you learn about Christianity  and as you learn about it, you love it and you say, I want to become a Christian.

That's where you're getting light and sight at the same time. But for most of us, it's different. We have the pieces of the puzzle. We have had the light for a long time. But becoming a Christian means, though you've always had the light, you're finally getting  the sight.

Though you've always had the pieces you've never seen the connection of the pieces to  each other and especially to you. There's a connection. You know, when I put the 20 pieces of the puzzle together, it's hard to even think of  it as 20 pieces anymore, even though it is, because the connection makes you see it as  a whole, or if you're looking at one of these books of ink blotches, splotches, and somebody  says, do you see anything in there and you say, no, I don't see anything. Then somebody says, oh, there's an elephant there. Look, here's the trunk, here's the tail, here's the body, and you say, oh, and once you  see that, you can't not see it.

Once you see the connection, you can't see the pieces anymore. Same, no different content, no different content, the connections. Because the closest I can come, and that's what the text is telling us, what it means  to say, I understand something, you know, the word even the word understand means to stand  under something. These disciples had seen the truth, but they had never stood under it. They had seen the pieces, they had never seen the connections.

And that's what it means, I don't know if I can go any further than that. You see the connections, you see the pieces, you see how it all fits. So let me ask you this, let's use this as a test. If that's how he does it, if that's how he breaks through the blindness, he makes you  connected. He shows you the connections, Jack Miller puts it this way, he says, the gospel, real Christianity  consists mainly in personal pronouns.

And then he says, always says it this way, he says, you know, a formal nominal Christian  says, Jesus died for sins. The Christian says, Jesus died for my sins. Jesus died for me. He suffered for me. In other words, a Christian, see a formal nominal Christian looks up on the cross and  sees the blood of Jesus running down.

And a Christian sees the blood of Jesus running after you, coming after you, you know, a formal  nominal Christian sees Jesus up on the cross sort of moaning. And a Christian sees Jesus looking at you and saying, it's for you I'm doing this. You must sit down and taste my meat. You must let me serve you. You must let me die for you.

You must let me love you. You know, that's, you hear it, you sense it, connection, personal pronouns now. So I've already in a sense answered my questions. How do you know that he's doing this for you? What are the tests to see, whether or not the illuminating ministry of Jesus Christ is  operating in your life, the prophetic ministry of Jesus from heaven?

How do you know it's happening? Let me just give you three tests, number one, newness. There's always a newness about what you're learning. That's just figures. See, deonoigo means a breakthrough.

And that means if you say, and I talk very often to people like this, they say, I've always  been a Christian and I say, fine, that's possible in a sense of meaning you've been a Christian  from the very, very earliest years and so on. But what I want to, I have to say, let me ask you, has there ever been a time in which  you looked and said, hi, I've never seen that before. I've been totally surprised this truth revolutionizes me. Anybody, there's a real Christian knows what I'm talking about. There's a newness William Cooper puts in one of his hymns, he says, sometimes a light  surprises the Christian as he sings.

This morning, don't ask me why, but when I was singing the second hymn, I heard the voice  of Jesus say, it just started to surprise me. Do you know what that means? See, that's what the illuminating work of Jesus is. I've sung that hymn a lot. That's why I chose this stupid thing.

You know, I generally choose the hymns that I like. One of the few advantages to my job, I choose the hymns I like, I like that hymn. I like how it goes from minor to major, you know, it's kind of cute, maybe some people  would consider it sort of a cutesy hymn, it's a minor key, you know, and then we see the  resolution. Here's the problem, here's the resolution, but in the middle of the time, it started  dawn on me. You know, I started to hear Jesus sang these things to me.

What do you mean? You're a Presbyterian minister, you heard a voice? No. Presbyterian ministers don't hear voices. We start hearing voices, we join the assemblies of God, but you know, we don't hear voices,  we belong to this Presbyterian church.

But I did. Because what happened was, as William Cooper says, sometimes the light surprises the Christian  as he sings, it is the sun who rises with healing in his wings. There's a surprise, there's a noonist, sometimes you feel like it's being broken through. Does that happen to you? Has it happened to you?

If not, you're still spiritually blind. Okay, another mark, it's a connection. Another mark, of course, illumination always is characterized by an engagement of the whole  person, mind, will and emotions. You notice that as he opened their minds, the scriptures, you see what happens? He says, then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.

Why did they return to Jerusalem with great joy? Because he told them to. He says in verse 49, go back. Don't come out here, go back and wait there, and I'm going to do something for you. And so you see you have the mind, the will and the emotions.

You don't just have the mind, it's not just that they opened, they understood the scriptures  better in an intellectual way. They didn't grow simply in information, the way you kind of grow in knowledge of your computer  program every week. You read a little more in the book and you try another couple of operations, nothing like  that. We're talking about spiritual understanding and you're moved to the bottom of your  being. Some people cry.

When they're moved, some people don't cry when they're moved. It's not a matter of crying or not, it's a matter of being moved. They're told to do something and now they obey, return and they return but they return  with joy. There's the mind, there's the emotions, the joy and the will. Now I'm doing what I'm told.

They say, go, he says go, they go. He says, return, they return, but they return with joy. The whole being, it's one thing to get, have wonderful Bible study and to find that  you cannot amend your life according to his will. Then you haven't really had this illumination. The mind, the will and the emotions are together.

There's the engagement of the whole person, but newness, the engagement of the whole person  and then last mark of this illuminating work of Jesus in your life is it's always gradual. It's always unfolding. There's a place in second Peter where Peter says, we have the word of the prophets made  more certain and you will do well to pay attention to it as to a light shining in a  dark place until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. I have no idea exactly what that means, but what it means is it's gradual. The light that God gives you when you have your eyes first opened to the truth and you  appreciate it and you see the connection and all this stuff we've been talking about.

It's gradual. It doesn't start right away. I mean, it doesn't go right away into fullness, it more and more. You see, you pay attention to it as to a light shining in a dark place until the day you  see the morning rises and the star rises in your heart and so on. That's the reason why you see in verse 52, pardon me, in verse 45, he opens the mind to  understand the scripture, but in verse 49 he says, I'm going to do more things for you.

I'm going to visit power on you. I'm going to give you even more. So go back to Jerusalem and wait for it. It's always a gradualness to it. There's always an increase.

A person who's truly illuminated sees it as a gradual thing. You see you're getting more and more and you're breaking through more and more. Now that's what he does. He gives his eyes. That's why he does it because we're spiritually blind and that's how he does it by making  connections and some ways of telling whether it's happening to you now.

Now let me just conclude by applying this a little bit. Some of you, let me just take this. If this is true, let me apply it to some of you. First of all, and I'll be real brief on this, and afterwards we go downstairs and we have  questions and answers and some of you might want to, if you feel like I'm going to quickly  here at the end and you wish I would explain more, come on down to these lounge afterwards  and we'll have questions and answers and talk about it. Some of you don't realize the holistic nature of Christianity.

You say, I know what to do, but I don't have the power to do it. You say, I know I shouldn't blow up, but I can't control my temper. I can't control my sexual appetites. I can't control my obsessive attitude toward work. I can't control my emotions.

You say, I know what's right, I know what I really do, but I just don't see how the power  to do it. You're praying to God for power in the abstract. God doesn't work that way. Look at the beauty of it. You say you think you know, but you don't have the power.

If you don't have the power, you don't know. Let me show you the organic way that the Christian power works. I know something about my wife and insects, and now you will too. If I see my wife reading the paper and crawling down the side of her hair is a big spider. And I say to Kathy, I say, Kathy, there is a big spider crawling down the left side of  your head on your hair.

And she says, yes, I know, yes, honey. And she doesn't do anything. I say, well, dear, I don't know that you hear me. There is a spider crawling down the left side of your head. It's getting near your face, near your skin.

And she says, yes, honey, I hear you. There's a spider crawling down the side of my head. I know she hasn't heard me. Why? Because if she heard me, she'd be getting animated.

She'd be, oh, you know, pushing it away. She may have sort of heard me and sort of said it. So what do I do? I pull she away. You know, this is typical.

She's distracted. And by the way, when she's reading the paper, she gets very distracted. I push the paper down and I say, there's a spider on your head. And when it sinks in, she's illuminated because her entire being, mind, will and emotion,  is engaged. Now, that's the way God gives power.

Look, a lot of people will say to me, I need self-control when it comes to sex. I can't control my sexual appetites. Okay, how does the Bible help? The Bible never says, control your sexual appetites or God will get you. He doesn't do that.

Let me show you how the Bible does it. In 1 Corinthians 6, Paul says, you are not your own. You're bought with a price. You're not your own. You're bought with a price.

No ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, therefore, flee sexual immorality. Let me say that again. You're not your own. You're bought with a price. No ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, therefore flee sexual immorality.

Look at that. What's the secret? It's not coercion. It's not you better control yourself sexually or God will get you. That wouldn't give you any power.

People are always saying, I know what to do, and I don't have the power to do it. What does Paul say? He says, no ye not. There it is. He says, look at what Jesus has done for you.

You're not your own. You're bought with a price. Look at what Jesus has put in you. You're a temple of the Holy Spirit. He says, you know why you don't have any problem with controlling your sexual appetites?

You don't know. These things. No ye not. Power comes with the knowledge. You're a whole being.

God doesn't separate you out. You can't say, well, I know what to do. I just don't have enough willpower. That's an abstract, that's a stoic, that's a pagan, that's a Greek, that's a modern,  is a secular way of thinking. What you've got to know is that Jesus Christ has given me truth.

And if I let it affect me, if I look at it, if I say, teach me. Set my heart on fire with it. If you look at it, don't you know, don't you know, don't you know, and the more you know,  the more you will be able. The more you know, the more you'll be able. That's what's so beautiful about this.

You say, you don't have the power, I say, you need Jesus to teach your heart. And he can and he will and he wants to. Talk to people, study, pray over what you study, reflect on it, don't give up. Don't just look at this stuff and say, oh, I know it. Say, I don't know it.

Like I should and I'm going to know it better and I'm going to use every means possible. I'm going to worship in it, I'm going to pray it in, I'm going to sing it in. I'm going to talk to people and I'm going to, but in it all, I'm going to say,  Lord Jesus, open the scripture, open my mind to the scripture. Can you do that? Will you do that?

If you'll do that, there's the key. Okay, one more thing. Some of you are absolutely and totally blind today, spiritually blind. He says the ones who are sure that there's nothing wrong are the ones who are totally blind. The ones who have begun to have their blindness, their spiritual blindness healed  are the ones who know that they don't see you right.

Who are you? Which one are you? The same Jesus Christ who raised Lazarus from the dead, however, can also raise your soul from the dead. And somebody says, well, I'm spiritually blind. What am I supposed to do about it?

It's very simple. Jesus already told you, I'll just reiterate it. As soon as you say, I don't see, at that very second, you've begun to see. As soon as you know that you don't see,  Jesus Christ is helping you to actually say that and you're finally responding to what he's doing. So the moment you say I don't see, that moment you begin to see,  the moment you say I'm blind, that moment your blindness begins to be healed.

That's the beauty of the gospel. That's grace. Are you willing to admit that? Or is there anybody here who says this is primitive and obscene? I'm a good person.

I'm a moral person. I don't need all this hokey stuff. I don't need all this dramatic stuff. I'm as good a person as possible. I'm as decent a person as possible.

You're blind. I stick my life on it. I'm more sure about that than you could, and I'm sure about that as anything. But say I don't see and you do. And say I do see and you don't.

Gospel, Christianity. That's the way it works. Hey, one more thing. Christian friends. Oh, well, Christian friends, on a very cold day like today,  if you leave a pale of water out, you can't just break the ice on it once.

You have to keep breaking the ice. And even if Jesus gets rid of your cataracts when you first become a Christian,  it's still possible, you know, for your eye to cloud up. It's possible for it to come back and you have to go back to the doctor. And that's true spiritually as well. Can you remember when the Word of God seems so radiant to you  and when the truth of God seems silverwhelming to you?

Let me ask you. Is it feel that way this week? This last week? You see, unless you're continually breaking the ice  and continually going back to them,  illumination is growing. It's a growing thing.

The truth of God is like a great ocean. And we're all like little children paddling along,  paddling around on the outskirts of this incredible ocean. No further in than three inches in the surf. We haven't even begun. Have you?

Do you sense God continually giving you greater and greater  spiritual understanding? Do you feel that you're being led through a kind of mansion  and every room is greater and greater and more ornate  and more beautiful and grand and high vaulted? Do you sense that you're growing in your understanding of truth  and you're grasping your understanding of truth  and that you haven't hardly even begun? There is nothing more inappropriate  than a smug Christian who thinks he or she knows it. There is nothing more inappropriate  than a bored Christian who thinks he or she knows it.

Smugness or boredom simply means  that your eyes have started crowding up again. Jesus is the light, rejoice in his light. He is not just a counselor, he's the wonderful counselor. Let's pray. Father, we ask that you would help us, first of all,  to see that we don't.

We pray for that first. We pray for the humility and the candor  that leads us to say to your son,  I don't see a right, touch me again. I also pray that you would help us to be a church  and a community where we lay out your son's teaching,  where we study his external word,  but always with the understanding  that not our smarts and not our great teaching ability  but only the illumination of your son's spiritual work  will ever open our minds. So give us that desire for anointing,  that desire for the spiritual work  and yet also a kind of hard-nosed  and rock-ribbed desire to master the truth. We pray that we be a community like that  and we be a place where people are constantly having their minds open  and that there be constant breakthroughs of the truth.

We thank you that this is a place where that can happen. We ask that it would become a place that could happen  with your help. We ask it in Jesus' name. Amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today's teaching, Tim Keller unpacks how Jesus actively seeks us, reveals truth to  us, and calls us to Himself. Let me read from Luke, chapter 24, it's printed in your bulletin. It's very end of the Gospel of Luke, verses 44 to 53, okay, and he said to them,  this is what I told you while I was still with you. Everything must be fulfilled. That is written about me in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the Psalms.

Then he opened their minds so that they could understand the scriptures. He told them, this is what is written. The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day. And repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in His name to all nations, beginning  at Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things.

I am going to send you what my father has promised, but stay in the city until you have been  clothed with power from on high. And when he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethlehem, he lifted up his hands and blessed  them. And while he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven. And then they worshipped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy. And they stayed continually in the temple, praising God.

This is God's word. Now many people today think of Christianity as a set of beliefs that you take up, something  you decide upon. Here's a set of beliefs, here's a set of ethical guidelines, and you take them up. You pick them up. You've decided this is what I want to do.

This is what I want to be. The Bible, however, describes Christianity in very different terms, almost opposite terms. The Bible says that Christianity is not something that you choose so much. Oh, there's a choice involved. It's something that comes upon you.

It's not something that picks you up. It's not something that you pick up. It's something that picks you up. It's not something that you take up. It's something that takes you up.

It's not something that you just decide to do, but rather it's always something that comes  at you. It's a force, and you do make a choice. You do make a choice, but it's always in response to something that you feel is arguing  with you. Something you feel is coming after you. Something that you feel is seeking you out, always.

What is it? It sounds mysterious, doesn't it? I tell you that you don't know real Christianity, boy, it sounds so arrogant, but it is true. I tell you, you don't understand real Christianity unless you've had that same sense. The sense of something having come after you, something arguing with you, something grabbing  you by the neck, something making you think about things that you don't really want to  think, helping you see things that you've never really seen before, unless you sense that  something is coming upon you and picking you up and taking you up, and in response to  that, you have to make a decision and in response to that, unless that's happening, you  haven't really experienced real Christianity.

It sounds so exotic, doesn't it, thrilling, mysterious? What is it? What is it that comes after you? I'll tell you what it is. It's Jesus Christ the Revealer.

What we're looking at today, and what we see depicted here, is that Jesus Christ is not  a passive Savior. Jesus is not depicted by the Bible as somebody who has died on the cross to deal with guilt  and to deal with evil, and then he sort of sits back and he waits for you to figure it  out. It doesn't do that at all. Instead, he comes after us. He is not just a priest, he's a prophet, he's not just a Redeemer, he's a Revealer.

He's not just someone who makes a provision for us, but he comes and he tells us about it. He comes after us. It's him. This passage tells us that after the resurrection, he comes to his disciples and opens their  mind up. And the Bible tells us that that continues to happen today, that through the Holy Spirit  he comes after us.

What am I talking about? It's what Jesus says in the book of John when he says, you have not chosen me, I have  chosen you. Or it's what Jesus says in Matthew 11 where he says, no one knows the Father, but the Son. And the one to whom ever the Son chooses to reveal him. Let me say that again.

No one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. See Jesus says, I'm the Revealer, I come to you, I let you in, I show you the Father. It's very natural, and yet I'll try to show you here in the next 60 seconds, it's illogical,  but it's very natural to say in our modern day, that's not fair, that's so narrow-minded. Why would Jesus say he's the only way to the Father, he's the only one who can reveal? That's not fair, that's not just, that's too narrow, let me ask you a question.

What did people say when Jonas Salk, remember Jonas Salk who came up with a polio vaccine? And Jonas Salk came up and said, I have discovered the only cure for polio or the vaccine for polio. I have discovered it. What did everybody say? Did they say that couldn't be, how unfair, that one scientist would find the cure for polio  and nobody else would?

Is that what happened? Did everybody say, well, that can't be, I mean, why would one scientist know it? Not all scientists, no, everybody knew that if you wanted to get the vaccine for polio,  you had to go to Jonas Salk. If you wanted deliverance, you had to go to him because he alone knew it and he alone could reveal the way out. Why?

There was nobody upset about it, they're upset about Jesus saying, I show you the way to the Father,  they're not upset about Jonas Salk, why? The reason they weren't upset about the polio issue was they knew it wasn't a matter of if it's fair,  just if it's true. It doesn't matter if his claims are just, if they're true,  if he really knew what he said he knew, then he was the way. That's just the way it is. And Jesus says, that's the way it is.

And we're going to try to show you in a minute why he's able to say that. But just to start, introduction,  this is an aspect of the message of the Christian faith, which is very important to know. It's very practical, it's very mysterious. In fact, it's almost romantic, to be honest, there's a romance to it. Christianity is something that comes and gets you,  because Jesus is not simply a king and a redeemer.

He's also a revealer of the hidden. He comes after us, and he shows us the truth. Now, let's take a look at this. Traditionally, and theologically and historically, this is called the prophetic ministry of Christ. The Bible says, Jesus is prophet, priest, and king.

He's a prophet, he's a priest, and a king. And today we're looking at his prophetic ministry. And let me just talk to you about it by looking at this passage where we see him engaged in it. And let's just look at it under three headings. What he does, why he does it, and how he does it.

What, why, how? What, why, and how? I'm saying that, so I remember it. And not so, I don't think you hear it. What, why, and how?

What does he do? He gives us eyes. He gives us eyes. Historically, the church has understood that Jesus' prophetic ministry had two parts. An earthly and a heavenly, or an external and an internal.

Traditionally, the church understands that Jesus Christ came to earth to be a prophet, which means  he comes down to earth, and he becomes a human being, and he teaches us. And he gives us verbal revelation. He tells us things about the word and the will of God. But that's not all he does. The Bible says that's what he did as an earthly prophet in the past,  but now he has a heavenly prophetic ministry in the present when through the Holy  Spirit he comes and he opens our minds to the truth.

So there's a past ministry and a present prophetic ministry, an earthly ministry and a heavenly  ministry, or let me put it another way. The other way to put it is that there's an external, he gives us the external word and  the internal word. The external word. When he came to earth and he taught us, and we have his teaching. Where it is, it's verbal, it's propositional, it's in principles, it's on a piece of paper.

It's wonderful what you have in the Scripture. This great set of verses by George Herbert that is on the title page about the Scripture. What I like so much, he's talking about the Scripture, he says, this is such great poetry. This is the thankful glass that mends the looker's eye. This is the well that washes what it shows.

Who can endure this praise so much? But here's my favorite part, he's talking about the Scripture, he says, heaven lies flat  in thee, subject to every mountain's bended knee. Heaven lies flat. Jesus has put what you need for heaven, the glories of heaven, the glories of the heavenly  realms into propositions, into words. It's there, there it is, the truth.

You might say the external word, heaven lies flat in thee. That's what an interesting way to put it, but Jesus doesn't just do that. He also comes to a spiritually and he gives us the internal word. He alums us to help us understand what's in the external word. You see these two things right here in the passage we just read in verse 44 and 45, there  it is, there's another example of it.

In verse 44, this is after the resurrection, after he's been raised from the dead, he comes  to his disciples and he says, this is what I told you while I was still with you. Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in Moses, the prophets, and the  Psalms. Now when he was with them on earth, he had already taught them the things that he's mentioning  here. He says from the Psalms and from the law and from the prophets, he had taught them a number  of things. So he refers to it.

But then, verse 45, then he opened their mind so that they could understand. It wasn't enough for him just to come the first time, he had to come the second time. It wasn't enough for him to give us the external word. He'd already done that, but now in verse 45, he gives them the internal word. Just to complete the analogy here, there's two ways in which illumination fails to happen  physically.

Either my eye might work, but there'd be no light, or the light may be on, but my eye  doesn't work. Light but no eye, eye but no light. Light is necessary for me to see, even if my eye works, why? Because you see what I see out there and what you see up here. You don't really see me, obviously.

You see, the light reflected off of me, it's bouncing off of me, and it's hitting your  retina, actually. So without light, your eye may work fine, but you won't see what's up here. On the other hand, all the light in the world won't help if your eye is dark, as the Bible  says. If there's something wrong with your eye, if it's not sensitive to stimuli, now you have  to have both, or you don't have illumination. Now, secondly, let's put it another way.

At the non-physical level, you have to have both things in order to have illumination. Let me give you an example. Here's a man and his family life's a mess. In particular, let's say here's a father, and he can't control his daughter, his young  teenage daughter. She's indulged in self-destructive behavior.

She's always antagonistic to him. She's dependent on him and yet she hates him. She's petulant and yet self-destructive and so on. He goes to counseling, and the counselor talks to the daughter, he talks to the father,  he talks to the family, and so on. Finally, the counselor sits down with the father and he says, the main reason why your daughter  is in the condition she's in is you.

The main reason is the way in which you've treated her, the way in which you have let  her completely depend on her. You're always bailing her out. You're never making her, allowing her to experience the consequences of her behavior. A lot of you know what I'm talking about here. The counselor lays this out to the father and it's a new idea.

He's never really heard it before. A whole new concept never thought of it. It's light. It's a new concept because the counselor is standing in the shoes of the prophet and the counselor  is bringing the external word, but the counselor is a human being and human beings can only  bring the external word to another human being. Because if the counselor is going to be a success, illumination won't happen unless besides  the new concept, the father has the eyes in the heart to grasp the concept, and you know  that may not happen.

In fact, it probably won't happen for what I know about fathers and what I know about  situations like that. The father is either going to say, here comes the light, here comes the concept, enabling  behavior or whatever you want to call it, and the father says, nonsense. I only do what any father would do. I love my daughter or even, he might even say, oh yes, I agree, but just not get it. Just not sink in.

It doesn't change his behavior. He still is not able to draw the line. He's still not able to put his foot down. He's still not able to give her what she really needs. And it may not be till years later that with tears, illumination finally happens sometimes  when it's too late, sometimes after a terrible tragedy.

And the father says, you know, the counselor years ago told me this, and I agreed with him,  but now I really see, I didn't get it, I didn't see it. You see, there has to both be light and eyes, and this is the glory of Jesus. That counselor is a human counselor. And one human counselor, a human prophet can never do anything else, but give the external  word to another human being. But don't you see for us to get illumination, you've got to have the internal word too.

You have to not only have light, but eyes. And this is the one of the great glories. This is a promise. You know, let me tell you something. This may be true.

It may not be true. Now I think it's true. I would die for it. But I'm saying to you, you know, the listener, this may be true, this may not be true. But there's no other religion, no other faith that even offers this.

You want to know that. Don't you see, this Bible is full of human prophets. And they're great. Men and women who brought the Word of God, they're great. We're glad we have them.

And all the other religions have prophets too. Men and women who bring the Word of God and bring the truth, bring the truth, talk about  reality. That's great. But all they can possibly do, if they're human beings, if they're only prophets,  if they're only human, all they can do is bring the external Word. You know what we need?

We don't just need a counselor. We need a wonderful counselor. Mighty God, Prince of Peace. See the great thing about Jesus is that he's not only a human prophet. He's a divine prophet.

He's not only human, he's also God. He not only brings us the external Word, but he then brings us the internal Word. He not only gives us the light, but he gives us the eyes, and that's no other prophet  can do that. No other prophet can even offer it. He opened their minds so that they could understand the things that he had told them.

Isn't that great? The greatest thing that Paul could ask for his friends and Ephesians, he prays to the Lord  for what? He says, I'm praying to the Lord. He says in Ephesians 118, that the eyes of your heart would be enlightened so that you  can know the things that I've told you, so you can grasp them. Paul knew his limitations.

He was a human prophet only, and everybody in this room we desperately need not just  a human prophet. That's enough. Let me tell you something. Every other philosophy, anybody who sells you a philosophy or sells you a religion that  doesn't have both the external and the internal Word, both the light and the eyes is passing  you bad money. That's what's the glory of this faith here.

You see, you've got plenty of religions and philosophies that simply give you the rules. They say, there it is, the external Word. Now try your best. Do it. Do it.

And then you've got other kinds of faith and religions that are all internal Word. It's all mystical. You look into yourself. You look at your navel. We can't tell you what to do.

You have to look inside yourself and get in touch with your own self and your own feelings. You see, you've got religions that have the internal Word only, and they're just a  morass of subjective mysticism, and you've got religions that have the external Word only,  but not this. This is Christianity. This may be true. This may not be true.

I'm telling you. But nobody else offers this. A redeemer who's a prophet. A prophet who's a redeemer, you see, a man who's a God, a God who's a man. And therefore he comes and he opens our minds as well as teaches us both.

Now why does he do it? So that's what he does. He gives his eyes. And secondly, why does he do it? And the reason he does it is because we're spiritually blind.

Let's take a moment to define that. The reason we need this is because he's spiritually blind. In verse 45, it says, when he opened their minds, so they could understand the scriptures,  the Word opened is significant. As you know, this was originally written in Greek, and the Word opened is a translation  of a particular Greek word. There were two different Greek words that could be used here.

One is a noigo, one is dia noigo. A little word dia is the word for through. Now a noigo means to open something like a door, something that's already got a latch,  something that's already got a provision for opening. So you use the Greek word a noigo with a door, but the word dia noigo doesn't just simply  mean to open. It means to break open.

It means to bust open. It means to break in. It wouldn't use the word dia noigo with a door unless it was a locked door. You use the word dia noigo with something like a mountain. I open the mountain with my tunnel, you see.

It means to break through two different Greek words. Which one do you think Luke uses? You just take a guess. He will not talk about the human mind or the human soul, like a door. He talks about the human mind or the human soul, like a mountain, layers and layers of obstacles  to the truth, impenetrable.

What Luke is saying is that the natural human mind until Jesus gets to it is spiritually  blind. It's blind. Now what does that mean? You know, one illustration you can use is you think of the eye itself. Very often as a person gets older, something develops on the eye called a cataract.

And a cataract is a clouding up or a misting up an opaqueness that develops where there  should be transparency. That's a perfect analogy, a much better analogy than other kinds of analogies, to explain  the human soul. God made the human soul with a transparency. We are different than the animals. We are different than the plants.

We honor the animals and we honor the plants as part of God's creation. But they're not in the image of God. What does that mean? They don't have a spiritual faculty. They don't have a capacity for truth.

They don't have a capacity for reason, but they don't have a capacity for a real personal  connection with Jesus, with God. And yet the Bible says, naturally because of sin, there is an opaqueness over top of  our soul, so that it has to be broken through. Another way to put it is we have cataracts on our soul. And you know what? You can rub your eye all you want that will not get rid of cataracts.

You can rub it and rub it and rub it and rub it. You can wash it and wash it and wash it, that will not get rid of cataracts, there needs  to be an intervention. There needs to be a medical intervention. Somebody that has skills that you don't have, there needs to be a surgeon. That's exactly what Jesus is.

The reason He's a prophet, not just a human prophet. See the idea, if you think all you need is the truth. You say, well, I just need somebody to inform me, that's all I need. You don't realize the depth of your blindness. You don't just need the light, you need eyes, but you need someone to take the opaqueness  off.

That's what the surgeon does. That's what the medical intervention does. And that's what you need more than anything else. Now you say, what do you mean by opaqueness? What is it?

Very, very important, listen carefully. The spiritual blindness is not a lack of reason. It's very possible for a person who is totally spiritually blind to read the Bible and accept  it, to say, yes, I see that Jesus died for my sins. I think that's great. I like that.

That's important. I believe it. It's not, to be spiritually blind doesn't mean that you can't intellectually comprehend something  from the Bible. In fact, it's natural and normal for people when they become Christians to say, last year  I became a Christian, but there was never a time in my life where I didn't actually believe  in the basic propositions of the Christian faith. It's very typical for a person to say, I became a Christian last year, but there was never  a time in which I didn't believe in the resurrection.

I didn't believe in the crucifixion. I didn't believe in the basic propositions of the Christian faith. People wouldn't, what do they mean when they say they became a Christian? Here's what they mean. The opaqueness is not an inability to comprehend.

It's not an inability to reason. It's not a rational inability. It's not some kind of operation of the mind. Jean Piaget talks about the various operations that develop as a kid gets older. You have sensory motor development, you have six stages of it and you have concrete operations  and abstract operations.

He's talking about the various sorts of mental abilities and operations, logical operations  and transactions that you do mentally. When we talk about spiritual blindness, we're not saying, we're talking about any of that. Spiritual blindness is not the inability to see the truth, but it's the inability to  value it, to appreciate it. Now the problem with that word is in English, appreciate is a fairly wimpy word. We appreciate you and there's a song where it says, Lord, we appreciate you and it sounds  I've ever sung it.

It sounds so wimpy. We appreciate you, but it's not. It's a good word and here's why and I'm going to keep with it and this is the heart of  what this opaqueness is and what spiritual blindness is. The word deep appreciate means something loses its value, therefore it loses its economic  power, it loses its clout, it loses its how much it can influence. You get a diamond, it's valuable.

What does that mean? You can do things with that. You can get things done with it, there's value to it. You have a diamond and you can go places, you can do things. You can get things for it, that's valuable.

When something deep appreciates it loses value, when something appreciates it gains value,  but the word appreciate in the English language can also mean that what increases is your  realization of the value of something, your realization of the power of something, your  realization of the influence of something. When a person says, I became a Christian last year, though I always believed intellectually  in the Bible and intellectually in the Christian faith, but last year I saw. What does it mean? What does she mean when she talks like that? Here's what she means.

I always knew Jesus died for me, says a new Christian, but I never realized that I need  to know that Jesus loves me more than anything else in the world. I need to know that deep down underneath that I didn't believe that I'm loved, but when  I one day, last year, I realized that what Jesus did for me is the thing that I need most  of all. It revolutionized me when I realized that when I saw the value of what he's done for me,  I suddenly realized I don't have to be like this, I don't have to be like this. This is the root of all my problems. Now, that kind of language means that the cataracts have come off.

She saw, but she didn't see. You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger brother. In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who  try to earn his love by being good. In his book, The prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart  of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental  older brother and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal, extravagant grace. Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith, The prodigal God will help  you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way.

The prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel in life share  the hope and joy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the world.

If some of you stock analyst types, if suppose I could send you back in a time machine  but there's nothing that a stock analyst would rather have than a trip back about five  years. Isn't that right?

Just go back five years, ten years, whatever, send you back and you sit down. You're back in time now and you sit down with the Wall Street Journal and you start to  read the stock stuff and you're sitting alongside of your stock analyst friends and of course,  they're there from their own time and they don't know what you know. They don't know anything about the future and you're going down a list and all of a sudden  you come to Microsoft and you say, oh my gosh, it's selling for that. If I buy a thousand shares of that, I'll be a quadrillion zillionaire in seven years. I will do everything I can.

See, I'm going to borrow, I'm going to beg, I'm going to do anything I can to buy everything  I'll put. How do you know? You know what they don't know. They go down all these little lines and one of them jumps out at you says Microsoft, why? You can appreciate it.

You know the value of it. You know the influence of that information. There's information on that line. Nobody else can see what it means. Nobody else can see the significance of the information.

Nobody can see that knowing that will make all the difference. They can't appreciate it. They're blind. They don't have eyes, you see, but you do. What does it mean to become a Christian?

It means to look at stuff that you've looked at for years and suddenly it jumps out  of you and you say, what's the matter with me? How could I have never seen the power of this? How could I have never seen the meaning of this? How could I have never seen the value of this? That's what the spiritual blindness is.

I know there's people in this room who say, well, of course I'm a Christian, I've always  believed. And yet that's never happened to you. You have no idea what that experience is like. And you're blind. You're spiritually blind.

You need to have someone break through, say, break through, the anoint go, open some years  ago. There were two women that I was counseling back in my first church in a little town and  I didn't know much about counseling. They both came to me within a week of each other and they had the same problem. They were facing a very devastating loss in their lives. And they came to a pastor.

Actually, there was no counselors in town, so people came to pastors back then because  there was nobody else to talk to about their problems. And they came on in at various times. In both cases, I laid out a passage of Scripture and then I gave them a book, the same passage,  the same book, the same basic theme. And a couple of, maybe a month later, I saw both of them and the one woman came back and  said, you know what? She says, when I began to see what God has given me and what I have in Jesus, I began  to realize, if I have that, then I can bear the loss of this.

And I could see she was healing. And the other woman, same age, same situation, same Bible passage, same book. She came back and she says, yeah, well, that's very nice. And I guess I believe it. But what good is that if I have lost the thing that I've lost?

She was inconsolable and she was broken from what I can tell permanently. What was the difference between them? Illumination, the same truth, but the one woman was able to appreciate the truth. She was able to see the value of the truth. She was able to sense the power of the truth and the other woman did not.

Let me tell you what illumination means. You say, I want peace, friends, until the goodness of God is more real to you than all of the threats  around you. You will never have peace. You'll be worried sick. You say, I wish I could forgive the person who's hurt me until the forgiveness of God is  more real to you than all of the injustice that's been done to you.

You will never be able to overcome your bitterness. It's a matter of illumination. It's a matter of appreciation of the truth because we're blind. And only as we break through, you want to overcome guilt, the truth has got to break through  of what he's done for you. You want to overcome worry, the truth has got to break through of how good he is.

You want to deal with boredom, the truth has got to break through and so on and so on. You're blind. We're blind. Okay. That's what he's done.

He gives us eyes. Why he's done it? Because we're blind. Lastly, how he's done it, and I guess I have to be brief about this, though I've already  in a sense answered your question, that issue. How does he do it?

How does he deal with the opaqueness? How does he break through the blindness? And the answer is, it's pretty mysterious, but there's one word here that gives us a  bit of a clue. It says, then he opened their minds so they could understand the scriptures. And the word understand is a Greek word, Sunet-Me, which literally means to assemble a puzzle.

And that's the best clue I can give you, look, if I lay 20 pieces of a puzzle out at  random on a table, and you look at it, but then I assemble it, put it into places. And then you look at it. What's the difference? Well, you know, it's the same 20 pieces. You're actually not looking at one bit of different content.

It's the same content, the same 20 things. But once I put them together, you see the connection. And see, to me, I think that's probably the key principle as to what is to how Jesus  does this. This is all very mysterious. Very long, listen, if you were raised in a Muslim country and you've never heard anything  about Christianity and you come here and you start to listen and you learn about Christianity  and as you learn about it, you love it and you say, I want to become a Christian.

That's where you're getting light and sight at the same time. But for most of us, it's different. We have the pieces of the puzzle. We have had the light for a long time. But becoming a Christian means, though you've always had the light, you're finally getting  the sight.

Though you've always had the pieces you've never seen the connection of the pieces to  each other and especially to you. There's a connection. You know, when I put the 20 pieces of the puzzle together, it's hard to even think of  it as 20 pieces anymore, even though it is, because the connection makes you see it as  a whole, or if you're looking at one of these books of ink blotches, splotches, and somebody  says, do you see anything in there and you say, no, I don't see anything. Then somebody says, oh, there's an elephant there. Look, here's the trunk, here's the tail, here's the body, and you say, oh, and once you  see that, you can't not see it.

Once you see the connection, you can't see the pieces anymore. Same, no different content, no different content, the connections. Because the closest I can come, and that's what the text is telling us, what it means  to say, I understand something, you know, the word even the word understand means to stand  under something. These disciples had seen the truth, but they had never stood under it. They had seen the pieces, they had never seen the connections.

And that's what it means, I don't know if I can go any further than that. You see the connections, you see the pieces, you see how it all fits. So let me ask you this, let's use this as a test. If that's how he does it, if that's how he breaks through the blindness, he makes you  connected. He shows you the connections, Jack Miller puts it this way, he says, the gospel, real Christianity  consists mainly in personal pronouns.

And then he says, always says it this way, he says, you know, a formal nominal Christian  says, Jesus died for sins. The Christian says, Jesus died for my sins. Jesus died for me. He suffered for me. In other words, a Christian, see a formal nominal Christian looks up on the cross and  sees the blood of Jesus running down.

And a Christian sees the blood of Jesus running after you, coming after you, you know, a formal  nominal Christian sees Jesus up on the cross sort of moaning. And a Christian sees Jesus looking at you and saying, it's for you I'm doing this. You must sit down and taste my meat. You must let me serve you. You must let me die for you.

You must let me love you. You know, that's, you hear it, you sense it, connection, personal pronouns now. So I've already in a sense answered my questions. How do you know that he's doing this for you? What are the tests to see, whether or not the illuminating ministry of Jesus Christ is  operating in your life, the prophetic ministry of Jesus from heaven?

How do you know it's happening? Let me just give you three tests, number one, newness. There's always a newness about what you're learning. That's just figures. See, deonoigo means a breakthrough.

And that means if you say, and I talk very often to people like this, they say, I've always  been a Christian and I say, fine, that's possible in a sense of meaning you've been a Christian  from the very, very earliest years and so on. But what I want to, I have to say, let me ask you, has there ever been a time in which  you looked and said, hi, I've never seen that before. I've been totally surprised this truth revolutionizes me. Anybody, there's a real Christian knows what I'm talking about. There's a newness William Cooper puts in one of his hymns, he says, sometimes a light  surprises the Christian as he sings.

This morning, don't ask me why, but when I was singing the second hymn, I heard the voice  of Jesus say, it just started to surprise me. Do you know what that means? See, that's what the illuminating work of Jesus is. I've sung that hymn a lot. That's why I chose this stupid thing.

You know, I generally choose the hymns that I like. One of the few advantages to my job, I choose the hymns I like, I like that hymn. I like how it goes from minor to major, you know, it's kind of cute, maybe some people  would consider it sort of a cutesy hymn, it's a minor key, you know, and then we see the  resolution. Here's the problem, here's the resolution, but in the middle of the time, it started  dawn on me. You know, I started to hear Jesus sang these things to me.

What do you mean? You're a Presbyterian minister, you heard a voice? No. Presbyterian ministers don't hear voices. We start hearing voices, we join the assemblies of God, but you know, we don't hear voices,  we belong to this Presbyterian church.

But I did. Because what happened was, as William Cooper says, sometimes the light surprises the Christian  as he sings, it is the sun who rises with healing in his wings. There's a surprise, there's a noonist, sometimes you feel like it's being broken through. Does that happen to you? Has it happened to you?

If not, you're still spiritually blind. Okay, another mark, it's a connection. Another mark, of course, illumination always is characterized by an engagement of the whole  person, mind, will and emotions. You notice that as he opened their minds, the scriptures, you see what happens? He says, then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.

Why did they return to Jerusalem with great joy? Because he told them to. He says in verse 49, go back. Don't come out here, go back and wait there, and I'm going to do something for you. And so you see you have the mind, the will and the emotions.

You don't just have the mind, it's not just that they opened, they understood the scriptures  better in an intellectual way. They didn't grow simply in information, the way you kind of grow in knowledge of your computer  program every week. You read a little more in the book and you try another couple of operations, nothing like  that. We're talking about spiritual understanding and you're moved to the bottom of your  being. Some people cry.

When they're moved, some people don't cry when they're moved. It's not a matter of crying or not, it's a matter of being moved. They're told to do something and now they obey, return and they return but they return  with joy. There's the mind, there's the emotions, the joy and the will. Now I'm doing what I'm told.

They say, go, he says go, they go. He says, return, they return, but they return with joy. The whole being, it's one thing to get, have wonderful Bible study and to find that  you cannot amend your life according to his will. Then you haven't really had this illumination. The mind, the will and the emotions are together.

There's the engagement of the whole person, but newness, the engagement of the whole person  and then last mark of this illuminating work of Jesus in your life is it's always gradual. It's always unfolding. There's a place in second Peter where Peter says, we have the word of the prophets made  more certain and you will do well to pay attention to it as to a light shining in a  dark place until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. I have no idea exactly what that means, but what it means is it's gradual. The light that God gives you when you have your eyes first opened to the truth and you  appreciate it and you see the connection and all this stuff we've been talking about.

It's gradual. It doesn't start right away. I mean, it doesn't go right away into fullness, it more and more. You see, you pay attention to it as to a light shining in a dark place until the day you  see the morning rises and the star rises in your heart and so on. That's the reason why you see in verse 52, pardon me, in verse 45, he opens the mind to  understand the scripture, but in verse 49 he says, I'm going to do more things for you.

I'm going to visit power on you. I'm going to give you even more. So go back to Jerusalem and wait for it. It's always a gradualness to it. There's always an increase.

A person who's truly illuminated sees it as a gradual thing. You see you're getting more and more and you're breaking through more and more. Now that's what he does. He gives his eyes. That's why he does it because we're spiritually blind and that's how he does it by making  connections and some ways of telling whether it's happening to you now.

Now let me just conclude by applying this a little bit. Some of you, let me just take this. If this is true, let me apply it to some of you. First of all, and I'll be real brief on this, and afterwards we go downstairs and we have  questions and answers and some of you might want to, if you feel like I'm going to quickly  here at the end and you wish I would explain more, come on down to these lounge afterwards  and we'll have questions and answers and talk about it. Some of you don't realize the holistic nature of Christianity.

You say, I know what to do, but I don't have the power to do it. You say, I know I shouldn't blow up, but I can't control my temper. I can't control my sexual appetites. I can't control my obsessive attitude toward work. I can't control my emotions.

You say, I know what's right, I know what I really do, but I just don't see how the power  to do it. You're praying to God for power in the abstract. God doesn't work that way. Look at the beauty of it. You say you think you know, but you don't have the power.

If you don't have the power, you don't know. Let me show you the organic way that the Christian power works. I know something about my wife and insects, and now you will too. If I see my wife reading the paper and crawling down the side of her hair is a big spider. And I say to Kathy, I say, Kathy, there is a big spider crawling down the left side of  your head on your hair.

And she says, yes, I know, yes, honey. And she doesn't do anything. I say, well, dear, I don't know that you hear me. There is a spider crawling down the left side of your head. It's getting near your face, near your skin.

And she says, yes, honey, I hear you. There's a spider crawling down the side of my head. I know she hasn't heard me. Why? Because if she heard me, she'd be getting animated.

She'd be, oh, you know, pushing it away. She may have sort of heard me and sort of said it. So what do I do? I pull she away. You know, this is typical.

She's distracted. And by the way, when she's reading the paper, she gets very distracted. I push the paper down and I say, there's a spider on your head. And when it sinks in, she's illuminated because her entire being, mind, will and emotion,  is engaged. Now, that's the way God gives power.

Look, a lot of people will say to me, I need self-control when it comes to sex. I can't control my sexual appetites. Okay, how does the Bible help? The Bible never says, control your sexual appetites or God will get you. He doesn't do that.

Let me show you how the Bible does it. In 1 Corinthians 6, Paul says, you are not your own. You're bought with a price. You're not your own. You're bought with a price.

No ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, therefore, flee sexual immorality. Let me say that again. You're not your own. You're bought with a price. No ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, therefore flee sexual immorality.

Look at that. What's the secret? It's not coercion. It's not you better control yourself sexually or God will get you. That wouldn't give you any power.

People are always saying, I know what to do, and I don't have the power to do it. What does Paul say? He says, no ye not. There it is. He says, look at what Jesus has done for you.

You're not your own. You're bought with a price. Look at what Jesus has put in you. You're a temple of the Holy Spirit. He says, you know why you don't have any problem with controlling your sexual appetites?

You don't know. These things. No ye not. Power comes with the knowledge. You're a whole being.

God doesn't separate you out. You can't say, well, I know what to do. I just don't have enough willpower. That's an abstract, that's a stoic, that's a pagan, that's a Greek, that's a modern,  is a secular way of thinking. What you've got to know is that Jesus Christ has given me truth.

And if I let it affect me, if I look at it, if I say, teach me. Set my heart on fire with it. If you look at it, don't you know, don't you know, don't you know, and the more you know,  the more you will be able. The more you know, the more you'll be able. That's what's so beautiful about this.

You say, you don't have the power, I say, you need Jesus to teach your heart. And he can and he will and he wants to. Talk to people, study, pray over what you study, reflect on it, don't give up. Don't just look at this stuff and say, oh, I know it. Say, I don't know it.

Like I should and I'm going to know it better and I'm going to use every means possible. I'm going to worship in it, I'm going to pray it in, I'm going to sing it in. I'm going to talk to people and I'm going to, but in it all, I'm going to say,  Lord Jesus, open the scripture, open my mind to the scripture. Can you do that? Will you do that?

If you'll do that, there's the key. Okay, one more thing. Some of you are absolutely and totally blind today, spiritually blind. He says the ones who are sure that there's nothing wrong are the ones who are totally blind. The ones who have begun to have their blindness, their spiritual blindness healed  are the ones who know that they don't see you right.

Who are you? Which one are you? The same Jesus Christ who raised Lazarus from the dead, however, can also raise your soul from the dead. And somebody says, well, I'm spiritually blind. What am I supposed to do about it?

It's very simple. Jesus already told you, I'll just reiterate it. As soon as you say, I don't see, at that very second, you've begun to see. As soon as you know that you don't see,  Jesus Christ is helping you to actually say that and you're finally responding to what he's doing. So the moment you say I don't see, that moment you begin to see,  the moment you say I'm blind, that moment your blindness begins to be healed.

That's the beauty of the gospel. That's grace. Are you willing to admit that? Or is there anybody here who says this is primitive and obscene? I'm a good person.

I'm a moral person. I don't need all this hokey stuff. I don't need all this dramatic stuff. I'm as good a person as possible. I'm as decent a person as possible.

You're blind. I stick my life on it. I'm more sure about that than you could, and I'm sure about that as anything. But say I don't see and you do. And say I do see and you don't.

Gospel, Christianity. That's the way it works. Hey, one more thing. Christian friends. Oh, well, Christian friends, on a very cold day like today,  if you leave a pale of water out, you can't just break the ice on it once.

You have to keep breaking the ice. And even if Jesus gets rid of your cataracts when you first become a Christian,  it's still possible, you know, for your eye to cloud up. It's possible for it to come back and you have to go back to the doctor. And that's true spiritually as well. Can you remember when the Word of God seems so radiant to you  and when the truth of God seems silverwhelming to you?

Let me ask you. Is it feel that way this week? This last week? You see, unless you're continually breaking the ice  and continually going back to them,  illumination is growing. It's a growing thing.

The truth of God is like a great ocean. And we're all like little children paddling along,  paddling around on the outskirts of this incredible ocean. No further in than three inches in the surf. We haven't even begun. Have you?

Do you sense God continually giving you greater and greater  spiritual understanding? Do you feel that you're being led through a kind of mansion  and every room is greater and greater and more ornate  and more beautiful and grand and high vaulted? Do you sense that you're growing in your understanding of truth  and you're grasping your understanding of truth  and that you haven't hardly even begun? There is nothing more inappropriate  than a smug Christian who thinks he or she knows it. There is nothing more inappropriate  than a bored Christian who thinks he or she knows it.

Smugness or boredom simply means  that your eyes have started crowding up again. Jesus is the light, rejoice in his light. He is not just a counselor, he's the wonderful counselor. Let's pray. Father, we ask that you would help us, first of all,  to see that we don't.

We pray for that first. We pray for the humility and the candor  that leads us to say to your son,  I don't see a right, touch me again. I also pray that you would help us to be a church  and a community where we lay out your son's teaching,  where we study his external word,  but always with the understanding  that not our smarts and not our great teaching ability  but only the illumination of your son's spiritual work  will ever open our minds. So give us that desire for anointing,  that desire for the spiritual work  and yet also a kind of hard-nosed  and rock-ribbed desire to master the truth. We pray that we be a community like that  and we be a place where people are constantly having their minds open  and that there be constant breakthroughs of the truth.

We thank you that this is a place where that can happen. We ask that it would become a place that could happen  with your help. We ask it in Jesus' name. Amen.

今天的讲道中，提姆·凯勒要阐明：耶稣如何主动寻找我们，向我们显明真理，并呼召我们归向祂。让我读一段《路加福音》24章，经文已印在你们的周报上。这是《路加福音》的最后部分，44到53节，好吗？他对他们说：“这就是我从前与你们同在之时所告诉你们的话：摩西的律法、先知的书和诗篇上所记关于我的一切话，都必须应验。”

于是他开他们的心窍，使他们能明白圣经；又对他们说：“照经上所写的：基督必受害，第三日从死里复活；并且人要奉他的名传悔改、赦罪的道，从耶路撒冷起直传到万邦。你们就是这些事的见证。”

“我要将我父所应许的降在你们身上；你们要在城里等候，直到你们领受从上头来的能力。”耶稣领他们到伯大尼的对面，就举手给他们祝福。正祝福的时候，他就离开他们，被带到天上去了。他们就拜他，大大地欢喜回耶路撒冷去，常在殿里称颂　神。

这是上帝的话。如今许多人把基督教看成一套你采纳的信念，是你作出的某种决定：这里有一套信仰，这里有一套伦理准则，然后你把它们拿起来、接受下来。你决定了：这就是我想做的事。

这就是我想成为什么样的人。然而，圣经用非常不同、几乎相反的方式来描述基督教。圣经说：基督教与其说是你所选择的东西，不如说它不是那么“由你选择”。哦，当然也有选择在其中；但它更像是某种临到你身上的东西。

它不是你把它捡起来；而是它把你捡起来。它不是你把它拿起来；而是它把你拿起来。它不是你把它接过来；而是它把你接上去、带上去。

它不是你单纯决定去做的事；相反，它总是某种向你迎面而来的东西。它是一股力量；而你确实要作出选择，你确实要作出选择，但这选择总是在回应某个你觉得正在与你辩论、与你争执的东西：某个你觉得在追着你、冲着你来的东西；某个你觉得在寻找你、总是在寻找你的东西。

这到底是什么？听起来很神秘，对不对？我告诉你，你并不了解真正的基督教。哎，这话听起来很傲慢，可这是真的。我告诉你，除非你也有过同样的感受，否则你就不明白什么是真正的基督教——那种感觉：有某种东西追着你而来，跟你辩论，揪住你的脖子，逼你去思考那些你其实并不想思考的事，帮助你看见你从未真正看见过的东西。除非你感到有某种东西临到你，抓住你，把你提起来、带走；而你对此必须作出决定；如果这一切没有发生，你就还没有真正经历过基督教。

听起来很异域、很刺激、很神秘，是吗？那是什么？到底是什么在追着你？我告诉你那是什么：就是耶稣基督——那位启示者。

我们今天所要看的、并且在这里所描绘出来的，是耶稣基督并不是一位被动的救主。圣经并不是把耶稣描绘成这样的人：他在十字架上死了，处理了罪疚、处理了邪恶，然后就退到一旁，等着你自己想明白。圣经完全不是这么说的。相反，他会来找我们。他不只是祭司，他也是先知；他不只是救赎者，他也是启示者。

他不只是为我们预备了一条出路，他还来告诉我们这出路是什么。他来寻找我们。就是他。这段经文告诉我们，复活之后，他来到门徒那里，开启他们的心思。圣经也告诉我们，这样的事今天仍在发生——借着圣灵，他仍然来寻找我们。

我在说什么？就是耶稣在《约翰福音》里所说的：“不是你们拣选了我，是我拣选了你们。”又或者，是耶稣在《马太福音》11章里所说的：“除了子，没有人认识父；除了子和子所愿意启示的人，没有人认识父。”我再说一遍。

“除了子，没有人认识父；除了子和子所愿意启示的人，没有人认识父。”你看，耶稣说：“我是启示者；我来到你这里，让你进入其中，我把父显明给你。”在我们现代，很自然会说——接下来我尽量在60秒内给你说明——这虽然很自然，却不合逻辑：这不公平，这太狭隘了。耶稣为什么要说他是通往父的唯一道路，是唯一能启示父的那一位？这不公平，这不公义，这太狭窄了。让我问你一个问题。

当年乔纳斯·索尔克（Jonas Salk）——还记得吗？就是研制出小儿麻痹症（脊髓灰质炎）疫苗的那位——站出来说：“我已经发现了治疗小儿麻痹症的唯一方法，或者说，小儿麻痹症的疫苗。我发现了。”大家怎么说？他们会说“不可能”“太不公平了，怎么能让一个科学家找到小儿麻痹症的治愈方法，而别人都找不到”吗？

事情是这样发展的吗？大家会说：“这不可能啊。为什么只让一个科学家知道？应该让所有科学家都知道才对。”不，大家都知道：如果你想得到小儿麻痹症的疫苗，你就得去找乔纳斯·索尔克。如果你想得拯救、想脱离这种病，你就得去找他，因为只有他知道，而且只有他能把出路揭示出来。为什么？

没有人因此生气。可他们却会因为耶稣说“我把通往父的路指给你”而生气；但对乔纳斯·索尔克却不生气，为什么？人们在小儿麻痹症这件事上不生气，是因为他们知道关键不在于“公不公平”，而在于“是不是真的”。他的宣称是否公正并不重要；重要的是如果那是真的——如果他真的知道他所说自己知道的——那么他就是那条路。事情就是这样。而耶稣说：事情同样就是这样。

我们一会儿要试着向你说明，为什么他有资格这么说。不过先作为引言要说：这是基督信仰信息中的一个层面，非常重要，值得认识。它很实际，也很神秘。坦白说，它几乎带着一种浪漫色彩——里面有一种“浪漫”。基督教是一种会来“抓住你”的信仰，因为耶稣不只是君王和救赎主。

他还是那位揭示隐藏之事的人。他追寻我们，向我们显明真理。现在我们来看看这一点。传统上，从神学与历史的角度，这被称为“基督的先知职分”。圣经说，耶稣是先知、祭司、君王。

他是先知，是祭司，也是君王。今天我们要看的就是他的先知职分。我想借着这段经文来跟你谈一谈，因为我们看见他正在实行这一职分。我们用三个标题来观察：他做什么、他为什么这么做、他怎么做。

什么、为什么、怎么？什么、为什么、怎么？我这么重复，是为了让我自己记得住，并不是因为我觉得你们听不见。什么、为什么、怎么？

他做什么？他赐给我们眼睛。他赐给我们眼睛。历来教会理解耶稣的先知职分有两个部分：一个属地的、一个属天的；或者说，一个外在的、一个内在的。

传统上，教会理解耶稣基督来到地上是要作先知；这意味着他降世为人，教导我们，并把口头的启示赐给我们。他把上帝的话语和旨意告诉我们。但他所做的不止这些。圣经说，那是他过去在地上作先知时所做的；而如今，在现今，他还有一种属天的先知性事工：借着圣灵他临到，开启我们的心思，使我们明白真理。

所以有过去的事工，也有现在的先知性事工；有地上的事工，也有属天的事工。或者我换一种说法：他赐给我们外在的话语，也赐给我们内在的话语。

外在的话语：当他来到地上教导我们，我们就有他的教训。它在哪里？它是口头的，是命题式的，是以原则的形式呈现的，是写在纸上的。

你在圣经里所拥有的真是奇妙。乔治·赫伯特（George Herbert）那段写在扉页上的关于圣经的伟大诗句，实在精彩。我之所以特别喜欢，是因为他在谈论圣经时说——这真是极美的诗——“这是一面感恩的镜子，能修补观看者的眼睛；这是一口井，能洗净它所显明的。”

谁能承受这样丰盛的称赞呢？但我最喜欢的部分在这里：他在谈论圣经时说，“天在你里面平铺展开，万山都向它屈膝。”天在你里面平铺展开。耶稣把你所需要的、关于天国的事，天上的荣耀、属天境界的荣光，放进命题里，放进言语里。就在那里——你看，真理就在那儿。

你可以把这称为“外在的话语”——“天在你里面平铺展开”。这是多么有意思的说法；但耶稣不只是这样做。他也属灵地临到，把“内在的话语”赐给我们：他光照我们，帮助我们明白外在话语里所写的内容。你在我们刚读的经文第44、45节就能看见这两件事——这又是一个例子。

在第44节，这是复活之后、他从死里复起之后，他来到门徒面前说：“这就是我从前与你们同在之时所告诉你们的话：摩西的律法、先知书和诗篇上所记着的，凡指着我的话都必须应验。”当他在地上与他们同在时，他其实早已教导过他们这里所提到的那些事。他说，他从诗篇、从律法、从先知书里，已经教导过他们许多内容。所以他在这里提到那教导。

但是接着到第45节：于是他开他们的心窍，使他们能明白圣经。仅仅第一次来还不够，他必须第二次再来。仅仅把外在的话语赐给我们也不够——这他早已做了；但如今在第45节，他把内在的话语也赐给他们。

为了把这个类比讲完整：从身体层面来说，“光照”之所以会失败，大致有两种情况。

要么我的眼睛本身能用，但没有光；要么灯是亮的，但我的眼睛不工作。无光而有眼，有光而无眼。即便眼睛正常，光仍然是我能看见所必需的，为什么？因为你所看见的既有“外面”的，也有“这里面”的。你当然不会真的直接看见“我”。

你所看见的，是光从我身上反射出来，弹回来，实际上落到你的视网膜上。所以没有光的话，你的眼睛也许完全正常，却看不见“这里面”的东西。另一方面，世界上再多的光也无济于事——如果你的眼睛是黑暗的，正如圣经所说；如果你的眼睛出了问题、对刺激不敏感——那也没用。两样都得有，否则就没有光照。第二，我们也可以换一种说法。

在非物质的层面，要有“光照”，这两样也都必须具备。我给你举个例子。有一个男人，他的家庭生活一团糟。特别是，假设这是一位父亲，他管不住自己的女儿——一个刚进入青春期的少女。她沉溺在自我毁灭的行为里。

她总是跟他对着干。她依赖他，却又恨他。她任性，却又自我毁灭，诸如此类。

他去做心理辅导，辅导员跟女儿谈、跟父亲谈、跟全家谈，等等。

最后，辅导员坐下来对父亲说：你女儿之所以落到现在这种光景，主要原因就是你。

主要原因在于你对待她的方式，在于你让她完全依赖她（你）。

你总是在替她收拾烂摊子。你从不让她、也不允许她去经历自己行为带来的后果。很多人都明白我在说什么。

辅导员把这些向父亲一一说明，这对父亲来说是个全新的想法。

他以前从来没有真正听过这种说法。这是一个全新的概念，他从未想过。仿佛有光照进来。这之所以是个新概念，是因为这位辅导者站在先知的立场上，辅导者把外在的话语带进来；但辅导者仍然是一个人，而人所能做的，不过是把外在的话语带给另一个人。因为如果这位辅导者要真正奏效，除了这个新概念之外，还必须有一件事：这位父亲的心眼要能看见、能抓住这个概念；而你知道，这未必会发生。

事实上，就我对父亲们的了解、以及我对那类处境的了解，这多半不会发生。父亲要么会说：“好了，光来了，概念来了——所谓纵容行为（enabling behavior）也好，你想怎么叫都行。”然后父亲说：“胡说八道。我不过是做任何一个父亲都会做的事。我爱我的女儿。”或者，他甚至可能会说：“哦，是的，我同意。”但他就是没有真正明白，没有真正领会——就是没有沉进去。

这并不会改变他的行为。他仍然无法划清界限；仍然无法强硬起来、立下规矩；仍然无法给她真正需要的东西。也许要到多年以后，他才会流着泪，光照终于临到——有时是来得太迟，有时是在一场可怕的悲剧之后。

那位父亲说：“你知道，多年前那位辅导者就跟我说过这些，我也同意他；但现在我真的看见了——我当时没有明白，我没有看见。”你看，必须既有光，也有眼睛——这就是耶稣的荣耀。那位辅导者是个普通的人类辅导者。一个人类的辅导者、一个人类的先知，除了把外在的话语给另一个人之外，永远做不了别的。但你难道看不出来吗？我们若要得着光照，也必须同时有内在的话语。

你不仅需要光，也需要眼睛。而这就是其中一个极大的荣耀——这是一个应许。你知道，让我告诉你一件事：这可能是真的。

也可能不是真的。现在我认为这是真的；我愿意为此舍命。但我是在对你——听众——说：这可能是真的，也可能不是真的。可是没有任何别的宗教、没有任何别的信仰，甚至连这种东西都不提供。

你要知道这一点。你难道看不出来吗？这本圣经里充满了人类先知。他们很伟大。那些把上帝的话语带来的人——无论男女——他们都很伟大。我们很庆幸有他们。

其他所有宗教也都有先知——带来上帝的话语、带来真理，谈论现实的男男女女。这很好。但如果他们只是人，如果他们只不过是先知、只不过是人类，他们所能做的最多也就是带来外在的话语。你知道我们需要什么吗？

我们不只是需要一个辅导者；我们需要一位奇妙的策士——全能的神、和平的君。你看，耶稣最伟大的地方在于：他不只是一个人的先知；他是神性的先知。

他不只是人，他也是神。他不仅把外在的话语带给我们，随后还把内在的话语带进我们里面。他不仅赐下光，还赐下眼睛——而这是任何别的先知都做不到的。任何别的先知甚至连提出这种可能都做不到。他开启他们的心思，使他们能明白他告诉他们的事。

这不是很奇妙吗？保罗为他在以弗所的朋友所求的、他能求到的最重要的事是什么？他向主祷告什么？他在《以弗所书》1章18节说：我祈求你们心中的眼睛得以明亮，好叫你们能知道我告诉你们的那些事，能把它们真正抓住。保罗知道自己的局限。

他只是一个人的先知；而在座的每一位，我们迫切需要的不只是一个人的先知。那还不够。让我告诉你：任何一种哲学——任何一个向你兜售哲学或兜售宗教、却没有同时拥有外在话语与内在话语、同时拥有光与眼睛的——都是在给你假钱。这正是这信仰的荣耀所在。

你看，有许多宗教和哲学只是把规条给你。他们说：就在那儿——外在的话语。现在你尽力去做吧。做出来。去做。

也有另外一些信仰和宗教完全只有内在的话语：全是神秘体验。你往自己里面看，你盯着自己的肚脐。我们没法告诉你该做什么。

你必须往内心去寻，去接触你自己的“自我”和你自己的感受。你看，有些宗教只有内在的话语，于是就沦为一团主观神秘主义的泥沼；也有些宗教只有外在的话语——但不是这样。这里是基督教。它也许是真的；也许不是真的。

我在告诉你：没有别的地方会提供这个——一位救赎主，同时也是先知；一位先知，同时也是救赎主。你看，一个人就是神，一个神成为人。因此，他来不仅教导我们，也开启我们的心思，使我们两样都得着。

那么，他为什么要这样做呢？这就是他所做的：他把自己的眼睛给出去。第二，他为什么要这样做呢？原因是因为我们在属灵上是瞎眼的。

我们花一点时间来界定一下这个。我们之所以需要这一切，是因为我们属灵上是瞎眼的。第45节说，当他“开他们的心窍，使他们能明白圣经”的时候，这里的“开”这个词很关键。你们知道，这段原文是希腊文，而“开”是对某个特定希腊词的翻译。在这里本来有两个不同的希腊词可以用。

一个是 a noigo，一个是 dia noigo。小词 dia 的意思是“穿过”。a noigo 的意思是把某样东西打开，就像打开一扇门——那门本来就有门闩，本来就有可以打开的装置。所以你会用希腊词 a noigo 来描述门；但 dia noigo 不只是“打开”的意思，它的意思是“撬开”。

它的意思是把它“砸开”，是“破开”，是“闯入”。除非那是一扇上了锁的门，否则你不会用 dia noigo 来描述门。你会把 dia noigo 用在像一座山那样的东西上：比如说，“我用隧道把这座山打开”，明白吗？

它的意思是突破——这是两个不同的希腊词。你觉得路加会用哪一个？你猜一猜。他不会把人的心思或人的灵魂说成像一扇门；他把人的心思或人的灵魂说成像一座山——一层又一层阻挡真理的障碍，无法穿透。

路加所说的是：天然的人心在耶稣触及之前，在属灵上是瞎眼的——是瞎的。那么这是什么意思呢？你可以用一个比喻：想想眼睛本身。一个人上了年纪，眼睛里常常会长出一种东西，叫白内障。

白内障就是本该透明的地方出现了混浊、起雾、不透明。这是一个绝佳的类比——比其他各种类比都更好——用来解释人的灵魂。上帝造人的灵魂本来是透明的。我们与动物不同，与植物不同。

我们尊重动物，也尊重植物，因为它们都是上帝创造的一部分。但它们不是照着上帝的形象造的。这是什么意思？意思是它们没有属灵的官能；它们没有领受真理的能力。

他们也许有理性思考的能力，但他们没有能力与耶稣、与神建立一种真实的、个人性的连接。然而圣经说，很自然地，由于罪，我们的灵魂上方覆着一层不透明的遮蔽，必须把它打破、穿透。换句话说，我们的灵魂得了白内障。你知道吗？你再怎么揉眼睛，也不可能把白内障揉掉。

你可以揉啊揉啊揉啊揉啊；你可以洗啊洗啊洗啊；这些都不能去掉白内障。需要一次介入，需要一次医学上的介入。需要一个拥有你所没有的技能的人——需要一位外科医生。这正是耶稣所是的。

他之所以是先知，并且不只是一个人的先知，就在这里。你看，如果你以为你所需要的只是“真理”，你会说：我只需要有人告诉我、给我信息就行了。我只要这个。你没有意识到自己失明的深度。你不只是需要光，你需要眼睛；更准确地说，你需要有人把那层不透明的遮蔽除去。

外科医生做的就是这个；医学介入做的就是这个。而这正是你比任何别的更需要的。你可能会问：你说的“不透明的遮蔽”是什么意思？那到底是什么？

非常非常重要，请仔细听。属灵的瞎眼并不是缺乏理性。一个人在属灵上完全瞎眼，却仍然可能读圣经并且在理智上接受它——说：是的，我看见耶稣为我的罪死了。我觉得这很好，我喜欢这样。

这当然重要；我相信。属灵的瞎眼，并不意味着你不能在智性上理解圣经里的某些东西。事实上，人们成为基督徒时常常会说：去年我成了基督徒，但在我生命中从来没有一个时候，我不相信基督信仰最基本的命题。一个人很典型会说：我去年成了基督徒，但从来没有一个时候我不相信复活。

我不相信钉十字架；我不相信基督信仰的基本命题。人们会说：那他们说自己“成了基督徒”到底是什么意思？他们的意思是：那层不透明的遮蔽并不是一种无法理解的能力缺失。

这不是推理能力的问题。不是理性能力的缺失。也不是什么大脑运作出了问题。让·皮亚杰谈到，孩子长大时会逐步发展出各种“操作能力”。有感知—运动的发展，有六个阶段；还有具体运算、抽象运算。

他讲的是各种各样的心理能力和心理操作——逻辑上的运算，以及你在头脑里进行的各种处理与“交易”。当我们谈到“属灵的瞎眼”时，我们说的不是这些。属灵的瞎眼，不是不知道真理，而是无法去重视它、无法去珍视它、无法去欣赏它。

现在这个词在英语里有个问题：appreciate（欣赏/感激）在英语里听起来挺“软”的。有时候我们说“我们很感激你”，还有一首歌唱“主啊，我们感激你”，听起来就……我以前唱过。

听起来很软弱，好像轻飘飘的：“我们感激你。”但其实不是。这个词很好，原因在这里。我会继续用这个词，因为这正是这种“不透明”、这种属灵瞎眼的核心。

“appreciate”这个词在深层意义上，指的是某样东西的价值发生变化：因此它失去经济上的力量，失去分量，失去影响力——失去它能左右你、推动你到什么程度的能力。你拿到一颗钻石，它很有价值。

这是什么意思？意思是你能用它做事。它能帮你把事情办成，它有“价值”。你有一颗钻石，你就能去一些地方、做一些事情。你可以用它换来你想要的东西——这就叫“有价值”。

当某样东西“deep depreciates”（大幅贬值）时，它就失去价值；当某样东西“appreciates”（升值）时，它就增值。但在英语里，appreciate 这个词也可以指：增加的是你对某样东西价值的认识、你对它力量的认识、你对它影响力的认识。

当一个人说：“我去年成了基督徒。其实我一直在理智上相信圣经，也在理智上相信基督信仰，但去年我看见了。”这是什么意思？她这样说到底在表达什么？她的意思是这样的。

一位新的基督徒说：“我一直都知道耶稣为我死了，但我从来没有意识到，我需要知道耶稣爱我，胜过这世界上的一切。我需要知道，在内心深处、在最底下，其实我是不相信自己被爱着的；可当我有一天——去年——我意识到，耶稣为我做的事，是我最最需要的东西。那彻底改变了我：当我看见他为我所做之事的价值时，我忽然意识到，我不必再这样，我不必再这样。这就是我所有问题的根源。”现在，这样的语言就意味着白内障被揭掉了。

她看见了，但她又没看见。你也许知道浪子回头的故事，但它不只是讲一个迷途的弟弟。事实上，耶稣讲这个故事，是要同时对两种人说话：一种是逃离上帝的人，另一种是试图靠“做好”来赚取他爱的人。在他的书《浪子之神》(The Prodigal God) 里，提姆·凯勒展示了这个众所周知的故事如何揭示福音的核心——这信息给那叛逆的弟弟，也给那论断人的哥哥，带来盼望；并且邀请所有人来经历上帝那种浪费般、奢侈的恩典。无论你是基督徒，还是仍在探索信仰，《浪子之神》都会帮助你用全新的方式看待你与基督的关系。

就回到五年前、十年前，随便吧，把你送回去。你现在回到过去了，然后你坐下来。你拿着《华尔街日报》开始读那些股票栏目，你坐在你的股票分析师朋友旁边，当然，他们是从他们自己的时间来的，他们不知道你知道的事。他们对未来一无所知，而你一路往下看清单，忽然你看到微软，你就说：“天哪，它竟然才卖这个价。我要是买它一千股，七年后我就会成为什么什么‘千万亿亿亿万富翁’。我会竭尽所能。”

你看，我会去借钱，我会去求人，我会尽我所能，想办法把这一切都买下来——我会把我拥有的都押上。你怎么知道？因为你知道他们不知道的东西。他们沿着这些一行行的小字往下看，其中有一行突然在你眼前跳出来：微软。为什么？因为你能看懂它的价值。

你知道它值多少钱。你知道这条信息会带来怎样的影响。那一行里有信息，但别人看不出它意味着什么。别人看不出那信息的重要性。

别人看不出：知道了这一点，会让一切都不一样。他们欣赏不了；他们是瞎的。他们没有眼睛，你明白吗？但你有。

成为基督徒是什么意思？

就是：你看了多年的东西，忽然之间它从纸面上跳出来，你说：“我怎么回事？我怎么从来没有看见这东西的能力？我怎么从来没有看见这东西的意义？我怎么从来没有看见这东西的价值？”这就是属灵的瞎眼。

我知道这个房间里有人会说：“我当然是基督徒，我一直都相信。”可是这样的事从未发生在你身上。你根本不知道那种经历是什么样的。你是瞎的，你是属灵上瞎眼的。

你需要有人为你打通——我说“打通”——需要那恩膏临到，把你的眼睛打开。

几年前，在我第一间教会服事时，我在一个小镇里辅导过两位女士。我那时对辅导懂得并不多。她们俩在同一周里先后找到我，而且遇到的是同一个问题：她们正面对生命中一次极其沉重的失去。她们来找牧师。

事实上，那镇上没有辅导员，所以在那个年代，人们遇到问题就来找牧师，因为没有别人可以倾诉。她们在不同时间来见我。两次我都给她们讲解同一段经文，又给她们同一本书——同一段经文，同一本书，同一个基本主题。

大概过了一个月左右，我又见到了她们。第一位女士回来对我说：“你知道吗？当我开始看见神给了我什么、在耶稣里我拥有什么的时候，我开始意识到：如果我有那个，那么我就能承受这一次的失去。”

我看得出来，她正在被医治。

而另一位女士：同样的年龄，同样的处境，同样的经文，同样的书。她回来却说：“是啊，那些话很好。我想我也相信。但如果我失去了我失去的那样东西，这又有什么用呢？”

她悲痛欲绝，而且就我所能看出来的，是被彻底击垮了，可能一辈子都走不出来。她们之间的差别是什么？是光照——同样的真理，但其中一个女人能够欣赏这真理。她能看见真理的价值。她能感受到真理的力量，而另一个女人却感受不到。

我来告诉你，“光照”是什么意思。你说：“我想要平安。”朋友们，除非上帝的良善对你来说比你周围所有的威胁都更真实，否则你永远不会有平安。你会担心得要命。你说：“我真希望我能饶恕那个伤害我的人。”除非上帝对你的赦免对你来说比所有加在你身上的不公都更真实，

否则你永远无法胜过你的苦毒。这是光照的问题。这是对真理的欣赏的问题，因为我们是瞎眼的。只有当我们突破这层遮蔽——你想胜过内疚，那关于他为你做了什么的真理必须突破进来。你想胜过忧虑，那关于他有多么良善的真理必须突破进来。

你想处理无聊，那真理必须突破进来，如此等等。你是瞎的。我们是瞎的。好吧。这就是他所做的。

他赐给我们眼睛。为什么他要这么做？因为我们是瞎的。

最后，第三：他是怎么做的？我想我得简短一点，虽然在某种意义上我已经回答了你刚才那个问题——就是：他到底怎么做？

他如何对付那种“不透明”？他如何突破这种瞎眼？答案是：这相当神秘。但这里有一个词给了我们一点线索。经文说：“于是他开了他们的心窍，使他们能明白圣经。”这里“明白”这个词，在希腊文是 Sunet-Me，字面意思是“把拼图拼起来”。

这是我能给你的最好线索：你看，如果我把一副拼图的 20 块随意摊在桌上，你看着它；然后我把它们拼好，放到各自的位置上；你再看它。有什么不同？嗯，你知道，其实还是同样那 20 块。你并没有在看任何一丁点不同的内容。

内容还是同样的内容，还是那二十样东西。但一旦我把它们拼在一起，你就看见它们之间的联系。你看，对我来说，我想这大概就是耶稣如何做到这一点的关键原则。这一切都很神秘。听着，这要讲很久：假如你是在一个穆斯林国家长大，从来没听过任何关于基督教的事；你来到这里，开始听，开始了解基督教；你越了解越喜爱，你说：我想成为一名基督徒。

那就是你在同一时刻得着了光和视力。但对我们大多数人来说，情况不同。我们早就有拼图的碎片，我们也已经拥有这光很久了。可是成为基督徒的意思是：尽管你一直有光，你终于得着了看见的能力。

尽管你一直拥有那些碎片，你却从未看见这些碎片彼此之间的联系，尤其是它们与你之间的联系。它们之间是有联系的。你知道，当我把拼图的二十块都拼起来时，尽管它确实还是二十块，但我几乎很难再把它当作二十块来想，因为那种连接让你把它看成一个整体。又或者，你在看那些由墨迹斑点组成的图册，有人说：“你在里面看见什么了吗？”你说：“不，我什么也看不见。”然后那人说：“哦，里面有一头大象。看，这里是象鼻，这里是尾巴，这里是身体。”你说：“哦——”而一旦你看见了，你就不可能再看不见。

一旦你看见了联系，你就再也看不见那些零散的碎片了。内容并没有不同，内容还是一样；不同的是连接。因为我所能最接近表达的——而这段经文也正是在告诉我们——所谓“我明白了”是什么意思：你知道，甚至“明白”(understand) 这个词本身就有“站在……之下”(stand under) 的意思。这些门徒看见了真理，却从未站在真理之下；他们看见了碎片，却从未看见这些碎片之间的连接。

而这就是“明白”的意思。我不知道我还能不能再往前说得更清楚：你看见这些连接，你看见这些碎片，你看见它们如何彼此契合。所以我问你：让我们用这个来做个测试。如果他就是这样做的，如果他就是这样突破你的瞎眼——他使你看见连接，他把这些联系显明给你。杰克·米勒这样说，他说：福音、真正的基督教，主要由人称代词构成。

然后他又说——他总是用这种说法——他说，你知道，一个形式上、名义上的基督徒会说：“耶稣为罪而死。”而基督徒会说：“耶稣为我的罪而死。耶稣为我而死。他为我受苦。”换句话说，基督徒不一样：你看，一个形式上、名义上的基督徒仰望十字架，只看见耶稣的血往下流。

但基督徒看见的，是耶稣的血在追着你、奔向你、来找你。你知道，一个形式上、名义上的基督徒看见耶稣挂在十字架上，仿佛只是呻吟；而基督徒看见耶稣望着你，说：“我这样做，是为你。你必须坐下来，尝我的肉。你必须让我服事你。你必须让我为你而死。

你必须让我爱你。”你知道，就是这样——你听得见，你感觉得到，那种连结；现在出现了“你”“我”这些人称代词，是个人性的了。所以从某种意义上说，我已经回答了我自己的问题：你怎么知道他是在为你做这事？有哪些检验，好让你看出耶稣基督的光照事工是否正在你生命里运行——也就是耶稣从天上施行的先知性事工？

你怎么知道这正在发生？我给你三个检验。第一，新鲜感（newness）。你所学到的东西，总带着一种新的感觉。这只是文字上的提示。你看，deonoigo 的意思是“突破”。

这意味着，如果你说——我常常跟这样的人谈——他们说：“我一直都是基督徒。”我会说：“好，这在某种意义上是可能的；也就是说，你从非常非常小的时候起就是基督徒，等等。”但我必须接着问你一句：有没有某个时刻，你看见一件事会说：“嘿，我以前从没看见过这个。我完全被震撼了；这个真理把我翻转了。”任何一个真正的基督徒都知道我在说什么。那就是一种新鲜感。威廉·库珀（William Cooper）在他的一首赞美诗里这样写，他说：“有时，一道光会在基督徒歌唱时忽然使他惊喜。”

今天早上——别问我为什么——当我唱第二首诗歌的时候，唱到“我听见耶稣的声音说……”那一刻突然让我惊讶起来。你知道那是什么意思吗？你看，这就是耶稣光照的工作。我唱过那首诗很多次。这就是我为什么选了这个傻东西。

你知道，我一般会选我喜欢的赞美诗。这工作少数的好处之一就是——我可以选我喜欢的赞美诗。我喜欢那首诗。我喜欢它从小调转到大调的走向，你知道，挺有意思的。也许有些人会觉得它有点“可爱”、有点“甜”，是一首偏小调的诗歌，然后我们看到它的解决、收束：这是问题，这是答案。但就在唱到中间的时候，我开始有一种感觉慢慢浮现。你知道，我开始仿佛听见耶稣把这些话唱给我听。

什么意思？你是个长老会牧师，你听见声音了？不。长老会牧师不听见声音。我们要是开始听见声音，就会去加入神召会之类的；但你知道，我们不听见声音——我们是属于这间长老会教会的。

但我确实经历了。因为发生的是：正如威廉·库珀（William Cooper）所说，有时候，光会在基督徒歌唱时突然给他一个惊喜；那是太阳带着医治的翅膀升起。有一种惊喜，有一种正午般的光亮，有时候你会觉得好像有什么在破开、在穿透。你有过这种经历吗？它发生在你身上过吗？

如果没有，你在属灵上仍然是瞎眼的。好吧，又一个记号：它是一种“连结”。另一个记号当然是：光照总是以全人的投入为特征——理智、意志与情感。你注意到当他开他们的心窍、使他们明白圣经时，会发生什么吗？经文说：于是他们敬拜他，并且大大欢喜回耶路撒冷。

他们为什么大大欢喜回耶路撒冷？因为他吩咐他们这么做。他在第49节说：回去。不要待在这里，回去，在那里等候；我要为你们做一件事。所以你看，这里有理智、有意志，也有情感。

不只是理智而已——不只是他们“打开了”，在智力层面更懂圣经了。他们并不是只是信息量增加，像你每周对电脑软件的理解那样：读一点说明书，再试两三个操作，完全不是那种。我们讲的是属灵的明白；它会触动你存在的最深处。有些人会哭。

被触动时，有些人不会哭。这不是哭不哭的问题，而是你有没有被触动的问题。有人吩咐他们去做一件事，现在他们就顺服——回去，他们就回去；但他们回去的时候充满喜乐。这里有理智——明白了；有情感——喜乐；也有意志——我现在要照着吩咐去做。

他们说“去”，他就说“去”，他们就去。他说“回来”，他们就回来；但他们回来时满心喜乐。整个人都被牵动了：做一场很棒的查经是一回事，但如果你发现自己仍然不能按照他的旨意去修正你的生活，那你其实并没有真正得到这种光照。心思、意志和情感是一起被触动的。

这里有对整个人的参与；但还有“新”的东西——整个人的参与，然后，耶稣在你生命里这种光照工作的最后一个标记就是：它总是渐进的，总是在展开的。彼得后书有一处彼得说：“我们有先知更确实的预言，你们要留意，好像留意照在暗处的灯，等到天发亮，晨星在你们心里出现。”我并不完全知道那具体是什么意思，但它的意思是：这是渐进的。当神第一次开你的眼，让你看见真理，并且你开始欣赏它、看见其中的关联，以及我们一直在谈的这一切时，神给你的光是一步步来的。

它是渐进的。它不会一下子就达到完全的充满；而是越来越多、越来越多。你看，你要留意它，好像留意照在暗处的灯，直到有一天你看见清晨升起、晨星在你心里升起，等等。这就是为什么你在第52节——抱歉——在第45节看到：他开他们的心窍，使他们能明白圣经；但在第49节他又说：“我要为你们做更多的事。”

“我要把能力加给你们。我要给你们更多。”所以你们回耶路撒冷去等候。这事总带着一种渐进性，总会不断增加。一个真正被光照的人，会把它看作一个渐进的过程：你会发现自己得着的越来越多，突破也越来越多。现在，这就是他所做的——他赐下眼睛。这也是他为什么要这样做：因为我们在灵里是瞎眼的；而他做这事的方式，就是让我们看见彼此的关联。接下来还有一些办法可以判断：它现在是否正在发生在你身上。

现在让我用一点点应用来作结。各位当中有些人——我就抓住这一点说。如果这是真的，让我把它应用到你们当中的一些人身上。首先，我会很简短。之后我们会下楼，有问答时间；你们当中有些人如果觉得我最后这里讲得太快、你希望我多解释一点，那就之后到楼下的休息区来，我们可以提问、回答、一起聊一聊。有些人并没有意识到基督信仰的整体性（全人的、整全的）本质。

你会说：我知道该怎么做，但我没有力量去做。你会说：我知道我不该爆发，可我控制不了我的脾气；我控制不了我的性欲；我控制不了我对工作的强迫性态度；我控制不了我的情绪。

你会说：我知道什么是对的，我知道我真正该做什么，但我就是看不见、也不知道那股能让我去做的力量从哪里来。你是在向上帝祈求一种“抽象的力量”。上帝不是这样工作的。看看这其中的美妙之处。你说你以为自己知道，可你却没有力量。

如果你没有力量，你就并不真正“知道”。让我给你看一看，基督徒的力量是怎样以一种“有机的方式”运作的。我知道一件关于我妻子和昆虫的事——现在你也会知道。如果我看见我妻子在读报纸，而有一只大蜘蛛正沿着她头发的一侧往下爬。我对凯西说：凯西，有一只大蜘蛛正从你头的左侧沿着头发往下爬。

她说：是的，我知道，是的，亲爱的。然后她什么也不做。我说：亲爱的，我不确定你有没有听见我说。有一只蜘蛛正沿着你头的左侧往下爬，它快到你的脸上了，快靠近你的皮肤了。

她说：是的，亲爱的，我听见了。有一只蜘蛛沿着我头的一侧往下爬。我知道她其实没有听进去。为什么？因为如果她真听进去了，她早就会激动起来。

她会——“啊！”——你知道，会把它拍开、推开。她也许是“有点听见”，也“有点复述”了。所以我怎么办？我把她拉开。你知道，这很典型。

她分心了。而且顺便说一句，她读报纸的时候特别容易分心。我把报纸按下去，对她说：你头上有只蜘蛛。等这句话真的“沉进去”的时候，她就被光照了——因为她整个存在：理智、意志和情感，都被调动起来了。现在，这就是上帝赐下能力的方式。

你看，很多人会对我说：在性这件事上我需要自制力；我控制不了自己的性欲。好吧，《圣经》怎么帮助你？《圣经》从来不会说：你必须控制你的性欲，否则上帝就要来收拾你。它不是这么做的。

让我给你看看《圣经》是怎么做的。在《哥林多前书》第6章，保罗说：你们不是自己的人；你们是重价买来的。你们不是自己的人；你们是重价买来的。

“岂不知你们的身体就是圣灵的殿吗？所以要逃避淫行。”我再说一遍：你们不是自己的人；你们是重价买来的。“岂不知你们的身体就是圣灵的殿吗？所以要逃避淫行。”

你看这段。秘诀是什么？不是胁迫；不是“你最好在性方面控制住自己，否则上帝就要来收拾你”。那样一点力量都给不了你。

人们总是在说：我知道该做什么，可是我没有力量去做。保罗怎么说？他说：“岂不知……”就在这里。他是在说：看看耶稣为你做了什么。

你们不是自己的人；你们是重价买来的。看看耶稣把什么放在你里面：你是圣灵的殿。他说：你知道为什么你在控制自己的性欲这件事上会觉得有困难吗？

因为你不知道这些事。“岂不知……”力量来自这种认识。你是一个完整的人。

上帝不会把你拆开来对待。你不能说：嗯，我知道该做什么，只是我没有足够的意志力。那是一种抽象化的说法；那是斯多葛式的、异教的、希腊式的、现代的——一种世俗的思维方式。你必须知道的是：耶稣基督已经把真理赐给了我。

如果我让这真理影响我，如果我注视它，如果我说：“教导我，用它点燃我的心。”如果你去看它——“岂不知……岂不知……岂不知……”——你知道得越多，你就越能做到。你知道得越多，你就越能做到。这就是它美妙之处。

你说：你没有能力；我说：你需要耶稣来教导你的心。他能，他也会，他也愿意。去和人谈，去学习；把你所学的带到祷告里；去反思；不要放弃。不要只是看着这些内容就说：“哦，我知道。”要说：“我不知道。”

就像我本该做的那样，我也会更认识它，也会尽我所能、用尽一切办法。我会在其中敬拜，我会把它祷告进去，我会把它唱进去。我会去跟人谈，我也会……但在这一切当中，我要说：主耶稣啊，求你打开经文，求你打开我的心思来明白经文。你能这样做吗？你愿意这样做吗？

如果你愿意这样做，这就是关键。好，再说一件事。你们当中有些人今天是完全、彻底地瞎了——属灵的瞎。祂说，那些确信自己一点问题都没有的人，正是完全瞎眼的人。那些开始让自己的瞎眼、属灵的瞎眼被医治的人，正是那些知道自己看你看得不对的人。

你是谁？你是哪一种？那位叫拉撒路从死里复活的同一位耶稣基督，也同样能使你的灵魂从死里复活。可有人会说：那我属灵上是瞎的，我该怎么办？

这很简单。耶稣已经告诉你了，我只不过再重复一遍：当你一说“我看不见”的那一刻，你就已经开始看见了。当你知道自己看不见的那一刻，耶稣基督正在帮助你说出这句话，而你终于在回应祂正在做的事。所以，你一说“我看不见”，那一刻你就开始看见；你一说“我瞎了”，那一刻你的瞎眼就开始得医治。

这就是福音的美。那就是恩典。你愿意承认这一点吗？还是这里有人会说：这太原始、太粗鄙了？我是个好人。

我是个有道德的人。我不需要这些傻里傻气的东西。我不需要这些戏剧性的东西。我已经尽可能做个好人。我已经尽可能做个体面的人。

你是瞎的。我敢拿我的生命打赌。我对这一点的把握，比你对任何事情的把握都更大；我对这一点的确信，就像对任何事一样确信。但你只要说“我看不见”，你就看见了；你只要说“我看得见”，你就看不见了。

这就是福音，这就是基督教运作的方式。嘿，再说一件事。基督徒朋友们。哦，基督徒朋友们，在像今天这样寒冷的日子里，如果你把一桶水放在外面，你不能只把上面的冰敲碎一次。

你必须不断地把冰敲碎。即使你刚成为基督徒时，耶稣除掉了你的白内障，你知道，你的眼睛仍然可能再度蒙上雾气。它可能会回来，你就得回到医生那里去。从属灵的层面也是如此。你还记得吗？曾经神的话对你如此光彩夺目，曾经神的真理对你如此铺天盖地、震撼压倒？

我想问你：这周你有这种感觉吗？就这过去的一周？你看，除非你不断地凿开冰面、不断地回到祂那里去，光照就会越来越多。光照是会增长的。

上帝的真理像一片浩瀚的海洋。而我们都像小孩子一样，在这片不可思议的海洋边缘趟水、嬉水；在浪花里最多也就没过脚踝三英寸那么深。我们甚至还没有开始。你开始了吗？

你是否感觉到，上帝不断赐给你越来越深的属灵洞见？你是否觉得自己像被带领穿行在一座宅邸里，房间一间比一间更大、更精美、更华丽、更壮观，拱顶更高？你是否察觉自己在对真理的理解上不断增长、不断把握，并且意识到自己其实几乎还没开始？没有什么比一个自鸣得意、以为自己都懂了的基督徒更不合宜的了。也没有什么比一个无聊厌倦、以为自己都懂了的基督徒更不合宜的了。

自满或无聊只意味着：你的眼睛又开始糊起来了。耶稣就是光，要在祂的光中欢喜。祂不只是谋士，祂是奇妙策士。让我们祷告。

父啊，我们祈求你帮助我们，首先，让我们看见我们并没有看见。

我们先为此祷告。我们求那样的谦卑与坦诚，使我们对你的儿子说：我看不清楚；请再触摸我一次。我也祈求你帮助我们成为一间教会、一个群体：我们陈明你儿子的教导，我们研读祂外在的话语，却始终明白：不是我们的聪明，也不是我们高超的教导能力，惟有你儿子属灵工作的光照，才会打开我们的心思。求你赐给我们渴慕受膏、渴慕属灵工作的心；同时也赐给我们一种坚韧、硬朗、咬定不放的渴望——去掌握真理。我们祈求我们成为这样的群体，成为一个人们不断被开启心思的地方，使真理不断有突破性的显明。

我们感谢你，这是一个可以发生这些事的地方。我们求你帮助，使这里越来越成为一个能发生这些事的地方。我们奉耶稣的名祈求。阿们。
