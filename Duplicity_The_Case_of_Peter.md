## English Transcript / 英文原文

today's message, Tim Keller explores the human condition through stories in the Bible,  uncovering what Scripture says about sin and why it's the only explanation deep enough  to face the truth about ourselves. Recently, there was an inner church meeting of Christian men in the city called Promise  Keepers. I got a chance to speak at it. The most unflattering way to put it, the most  unflattering way to explain that movement is to try to make Christian men make and keep  more promises, make and keep more commitments. It was interesting that at that time, I was  already preparing a sermon on the issue of integrity and Peter, and this incident here  tells us, especially the case of Peter, tells us more about the power of commitments and  the power of promise keeping.

I think any other incident in the Scripture. Let me read  it to you. Peter was sitting out in the courtyard and a servant girl came to him. You also  were with Jesus of Galilee, she said, but he denied it before them all. I don't know what  you're talking about, he said.

Then he went out to the gateway where another girl saw  him and said to the people there, this fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth. He denied it again  with an oath. I don't know the man. After a little while, those standing there went  up to Peter and said, surely you are one of them. For your accent gives you a way.

Then  he began to call down curses on himself and he swore to them, I don't know the man. Immediately  a rooster crowed and then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken. Before the  rooster crowed, you will disown me three times and he went outside and wept bitterly. This  is God's word. You see, earlier in the chapter, at the last supper, Jesus had turned to Peter.

That's what the reference is there in verse 74. Jesus had turned to Peter and said, Peter,  before the nights out, you're going to betray me. You're going to deny me three times. Three  times, before the rooster crowed that dawn, you will deny that you even know me. And Peter said,  at that point, up in verse 35, Peter said, even if I have to die, I will never disown you.

That's a promise. That's a commitment. Peter says, even if it means my life, I will never  disown you. And yet, by verse 73, 74, 75, he's doing it. In verse 35, he made a promise  that 40 verses later he's breaking the promise.

And we're told in verse 75, and this is what I want  to look at in particular with you, he went out and wept bitterly. You went out and he wept bitterly. Not just he wept bitterly. Why? He was an absolutely broken man in the profoundest possible way.

And yet within weeks, within weeks, he was poised as the leader of a new movement, the Christian  movement that was about to change history, and he was about to become one of the most influential  leaders in the history of the world. What broke him like this and then what restored him so quickly  and the answer is the same. And that is promises. What broke him was he did not understand the power  of promises. What restored him was he learned the secret.

See, he didn't understand the power of  promise breaking, but then he after that he learned the secret of promise keeping. And promises  is the reason he was broken and promises is the reason he was restored. And I'm going to just  propose to you that the bitterness of our lives, see Peter went out and went bitterly that a lot of  the bitterness of our lives comes from our inability to make or keep promises, to make or keep commitments. Now, when I use the word promises during the rest of this talk, the rest of this sermon, I don't  want people to immediately think of formal contracts. There's a place in the sermon on the  mount where Jesus says, I say unto you, don't swear at all, but let your yes be s and let your no be  no.

Now, a lot of people have misinterpreted that as meaning Jesus saying never take a vow. That's  not what he means. He says, don't swear, but let your yes be s and your no be no. What he means is  a Christian should be someone that every yes and every no, everything you say you ought to treat  as a commitment. Whether or not you say I promise, whether or not you sign on a dotted line, whether  or not you make it formal, there are not there are not to be degrees of integrity in my people,  says Jesus.

There's not supposed to be levels of commitment. If you say to somebody, I'll pray  for you. If you say to somebody, I'll call you. If you say to somebody, I'll look you up. If you say to somebody, I'll look in on you.

Jesus says, that's a commitment. Christians, my people are supposed to be people of their word, people who are dependable, people of  integrity. See, so promise keeping to Jesus is not just mean the ones where you say, I promise,  where you put your hand up in the air. Let's take a look at what Peter learned  and we'll look at it under two heavens. The first heading is, how promises  make us and then the second heading is, how we can make promises.

How promises make us and then  how we can make promises. First, how promises make us, this is the power of promises. Why was it that  Peter went out and wept bitterly? Because promises make identity and they make community. Did you hear  that?

They make identity and they make community without promises, without commitment, without the  willingness to make a commitment to deny yourself, to limit your options and to hold yourself to  a course of action that you stick with no matter what. That's a commitment. That's a promise. Without promises, there's no identity and there's no community and Peter lost both of them at the  moment. This is what promises make us.

First of all promises make identity. Why was Peter wept  so bitterly? I'll tell you why he didn't know who he was. You know why he didn't know who he was? Am I the Peter?

He thought of verse 35 or am I the Peter of verse 74? Which Peter's the real Peter? I don't know. My life isn't fragments because I couldn't keep a promise. Promises give identity.

See, when you ask a modern person what, who are you really? What is your identity? Another way to  put it is who are you really? Modern people tend to say it's my desires and my feelings that tell  me who I really am. That's who I am.

My deepest desires. There's an awful lot of talk still,  though I hope eventually it will go, you know, it'll pass away. The last 20 years has been a lot of  talk about people saying I need to find myself. I need to find out who I am. And usually in modern  parlance it means I need to get out from under all responsibilities, all promises, all obligations,  all covenants.

I've got to get away from all obligations and find out what I really feel like so  I can find out who I am. Because most modern people say who I am is my deepest feelings. But boy, I hope, you know the reason I hope that this is going to pass away because I'm hoping that  baby boomers are getting older. Because as you get older you begin to realize that your desires,  your feelings are not only in conflict with each other but they're even in conflict with  themselves, they're in flux. My deepest desires, that who I am but my deepest desires are in conflict  with each other.

Not only that, they don't even line up with themselves over period of time,  they change. It doesn't work. I mean look, what are your deepest desires? We all want the security  of having somebody who's always there for us what we like to freedom to play the field. You want security and you want freedom in the area of love.

You want security and you want freedom in  the area of work. You like the security of having money, but you like the freedom of an unstructured  life without, you know, the disciplines of a career. If you're looking to see what you deep,  most deeply desire, you'll see that they're at odds with each other. Peter wanted to be the leader  of the Christian movement. He also wanted to live.

And, you know, in the past, you know, those are both  desires. I would like to survive. I would like to not be tortured. I would also like to be a great  leader and they came together. Who's Peter?

You say, well, it's your deepest desire. Who knows  what your deepest desire is? One desire has the ascension for a moment. Another desire has the  ascension for the next moment. Here's Peter.

He really wanted to live. That's a desire. And he really  wanted to be a leader. Who is Peter? You say, well, his deepest desire probably was to be a leader.

No, his deepest desire at the moment was to be a coward. Is that all he is? What I'm trying to  say is your feelings cannot possibly be the core of your identity because, by definition, your  identity has to be that unchangeable core to yourself. That's always the same. By definition,  an identity has to be something which a core of sameness about you that is always the same  no matter what the circumstances and no matter what the feelings and no matter what the year.

That's what an identity is. Therefore, you are not your feelings because your feelings  are always changed. It means whatever you're committed to, you are your commitments, you are your  promises. If you aren't, if instead in every situation, in every, you following your six  circumstances and you're following the impulses, you'll never know who you are and nobody else will  either because there's nothing that you always are. Your identity is what you always are.

If there's nothing that you that you can say, I always am that because I'm committed to that  and no matter how I feel, no matter what the situation is, no matter what the circumstances are,  no matter what people say, I'm committed to that. Unless you've got something like that,  you don't know who you are. There's no identity without promises. Now, this isn't just my idea. Hanna Arrent, not exactly, you know, you're born again minister.

Hanna Arrent, quite a theorist,  quite a political analyst, she says, in one of her writings, she says this,  without being bound to the fulfillment of our promises, we would never be able to keep an identity. We'd be condemned to wander helplessly without direction and a darkness of each person's heart caught  in its contradictions and equivocalities. You hear her? She says, in your heart,  it's filled with contradictions and equivocalities. You'd have no identity unless you are bound to  promises.

See, Peter could have kept his life together. How do you keep your life together? Peter could have said, I am he, who will be there with you, Lord Jesus, regardless of public  or private, regardless of hard times or easy times, and the promise would have been the thread  that bound him together, all of his pieces, all of his parts. That's what integrity is. The word integrity is the same as our English word integer, which in mathematics means a whole  number is opposed to fraction, right?

And in the same way, how can you be sure that you are  a person of integrity? That means that you are not living your life in fragments or in compartments. How can you be the same a whole person? How can you be the same in public as in private? How can you be the same with one crowd as with another crowd?

How can you be the same on Mondays  you are on Sunday? How can you be the same in what you say and what you do? How can you be the same  from one year to the next? How can you be the same? Only by a promise that pulls it all together.

Otherwise, it's my glands, it's my feelings, it's my circumstances, it's public opinion, it's all  these things. Remember, you know, did you see the movie with Bridget Fonda, Nicholas Cage? It could  happen to you. It's about a cop, a near cop that promises a waitress that if his this lottery ticket  wins, since she made a contribution to it, he'd come back and give her half the winnings. Then he  finds out he won four million dollars.

His wife, when he hears, she hears about the promise to the  to the waitress says, forget that. It's not in writing, it's not written down anywhere, four million  dollars. You'd be an idiot to go back and he says a promise is a promise and he goes back and he  gives the waitress two million dollars. And one thing that's interesting throughout the rest of the  film, his wife, you know, the cop's wife who wants nothing but the money and has no other  principles than that, goes through multiple transformations of personality and finally collapses. But even though he really pays a price for sticking with his promise, he has a sense of himself  and it lasts throughout.

And of course, the best place for this is ever said is in that wonderful  play, that wonderful line in man for all seasons where Sir Thomas Moore is being told he's going  to burn at the stake unless he recants. And his daughter says, oh please father, his daughter's name is  Meg can't you please just go back on your word so that we can have you. And he looks at her and he  says when a man makes an oath, Meg, he holds his own self in his hand like water. And if he opens his  fingers, he needn't hope to find himself again. You know why Peter's weeping bitterly?

He opened his  hand and he was gone. If you say, well, I got principles, but if it doesn't look like it'd be  advantageous to tell the truth. If it doesn't look like it'll be comfortable to do this thing. Well, I'm a pragmatist. You open your hand and there's nothing left.

How does Peter know who he is? He has no idea. He doesn't have a promise that binds together every part of his life. Is he a Christian or isn't he? Is he for Christ or isn't he?

He doesn't know nobody knows. He can't even trust himself now. He's got no identity. Promises make identity, but also one other  thing we have to be brief, but important promises make community. You notice where he goes to weep  out.

You see that? Doesn't say, look he says he went outside and wept bitterly. That is not  not. That is not just an accident. That is not an unimportant statement.

He went outside and wept. Well, you know why? You say, well, yeah, it's common sense. When you've broken a promise,  when you have broken faith, when you've made a commitment and then you give up on the commitment,  you don't say to everybody, hey, let's gather around. I want to weep.

No, you go away. You're alone  because promises create community. There is no community without commitment. For 10 years, I ministered in a small town in the south and there were two men that almost virtually  wandered the street. They weren't exactly homeless, but they almost were.

They were born and raised  there and they were related to half this town, but they never kept promises. They repeatedly kept  breaking their promises. As a result, nobody trusted them and they had no friends. They had a lot  of relics. They had nobody who would be there with them because they were never there for anybody  else.

I don't like that. They couldn't even trust themselves. The inevitable consequence, the  inevitable result of breaking commitments or even failing to make them is aloneness, isolation,  being on the outside. See, in New York, excuse me, I run into people all the time who say,  of course, I don't make promises. Ask me no questions.

I'll tell you no lies. I keep my options open. I'm not going to make commitments. I'm not going to get stuck. I'm going to do that, which will  maximize pleasure and profit.

So I just want you to know who I am upfront. I don't make commitments  to people. I don't make promises to people. In other words, watch your back when you're around me. Look,  when you have a city like that, you don't have a city, you have a jungle.

And that's increasing  in the case, is it not? Because if you say, I'm not going to be there for others. I'm not going  to make commitments. To make a commitment is to say, I narrow my options. You can't be a friend  unless you narrow your options.

Instead of doing what you want to do tonight, you need to go  over and see that friend because you know that friend's going through something. I don't want to go  through it. I'd rather go do something else, but he's my friend. She's my friend. You have no  friendship.

You have no community without narrowing your options. Without saying, I've got a program  and I'm going to stick with it, regardless of what Lewis Meads is a man who wrote a terrific article  on promising. And he has this great line in it. He says, my wife has been married to five different  men since her wedding day. And every one of them has been me.

Because he's an old man. He's  writing after they've been married for over 50 years. And in other words, he's talking about how  much he's changed over the years. He says, my wife's been married to five different men. Everyone  has been me.

But connecting the connecting link that bound each of those men into an integrated  hole was the promise I made on my wedding day. That promise gives me an identity. And that identity  is I am he who will be there with you. If I ever shed that name, if I ever broke that promise,  I'd never find myself again. And the bond that connects us would break as well.

How is the wife over 50 years going to be able to have a relationship with a man who's changing so  much and vice versa? Of course, he's writing from the mail point of view. He says the only way that  she's been able to know is because of my promise. If I break that promise, there's no community. Why should she ever trust me again?

Why should I trust myself again? If I leave her to go off  with another woman, why should that woman have any confidence that I won't do the same thing to  her? And why should I even think that I will have any confidence that I wouldn't do it again? I open my hand, nothing there, and I'm alone. Always, always, always, the result of promise  breaking outside, weeping bitterly, looking around, no one there, including me.

Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache. We feel it in the world  around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way and what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing this month, what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers  a clear and compassionate answer.

Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer,  Dr. Keller shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us  and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of  our world, struggling with your own mistakes or choices, or looking for hope and joy,  what is wrong with the world will help you see how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our  world and the pain within each of us. This newly released book, What Is Wrong with the World,  is our thanks for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the good news of Jesus.

That's gospelandlife.com slash give. Now that's how promises make us. There is no society without people who make commitments and stick  with them. There is no families without it. You know what a family is?

A family is when two people  get together and they dare to make this promise. We're going to raise little ones until they're big  enough to care for themselves. And if you dare to make that promise, we're going to do it no matter  how they act. We're going to do it no matter how they treat us. If you don't dare to make that  promise, you don't have a family.

And you only have a family as long as you're keeping that promise. There's no society. There's no family. There's no marriage. There's no community.

There's no  friendship without being willing to rein your own heart in and say, I'm making a point with myself  and appointment with myself five years from now, I'm still going to be there for you. Now question, how can we make promises then? If promises make us, how can we make promises? And  here's why a lot of you are asking this question. I know you're saying, I got problems here.

I've  got real problems with what you're saying. You seem to make it sound so simple, but it's not. On the one hand, when you make promises, people take advantage of you. I've made promises and I've been burned. People have taken advantage of me.

I'm afraid to make  promises now. New York is full of people, as far as I can see, that have been burned by old promises  and who have said, I'm going to be much more careful the next time I do it, if ever. And then on the other hand, you've got other people who say, the other problem I've got is when I  do make promises, I can't stick with them. I can't stick with them. I'm like Peter, I break down.

I  can't follow through. But here's the secret. And you have to look at the whole story of Peter to  understand. In John chapter 21, Jesus comes and restores Peter. And in that passage, he just does  this.

I can give you synopsis. He does something. First of all, he sits Peter down at a fire. And three times he says, Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me? Peter says, yes, I do.

And then he asks him again, do you love me? And he says, yes, I do. And a third time, three  denials, three questions. Do you love me? And he says, yes, I do.

And after each time, what does Jesus  say? I want you to be a leader of my sheep. I want you to feed and lead my flock just like before. Before you broke the promise, I still want you to lead. I'm going to make you a good leader.

But he says to Peter, by the way, you ought to know that if you keep this promise to me now,  this new promise you're making, you're going to be killed. You know, you probably would have been  killed if you kept it the first time. Well, now that you've made it again, you're going to be killed  anyway. He says, the way he puts it is he says, you'll stretch your hands out on a cross. You'll  be crucified too.

And Peter turns to John, the apostle who's right next to him and he says,  what about him, Lord? And Jesus looks at Peter and says, what if I decide that you're going to  be killed, but he's not? What business is that of yours? Don't you know who I am? Follow me.

Now, what Peter is told there, you might say, what happened there? Because from then on, Peter was  a promise keeper. From then on, Peter kept his word. From then on, Peter became a tremendous leader. He became a man of identity and community because he kept his commitments because he made the  bigger your commitments you make, that you're dare to make and the better you keep him, the more  of a sense of self you've got and the more incredible friends you've got.

Don't you see that? It's a scary thing to start a church, but the people who got together and said, we're going  to start this church even though it's going to cost us an awful lot. There's a community there. See, the more the promise, the greater the promise, and Peter went on and he experienced the identity  in the community. Well, why?

How could that possibly be? And here's the answer. He saw Jesus as a  promise keeper. Instead of looking at himself, instead of saying, I can do it. You know, will power.

I can make the promise. I can do it. I know I can. Instead of drawing strength from will power and  looking at himself, he saw Jesus as a promise keeper. He saw three promises that Jesus made.

And I say to you, unless you see the same three promises, you'll never be a promised keeper. You won't be able to be too scared to make commitments, like those of you who've been burned,  and you'll be too weak to keep commitments. You'll be too scared to make them. You'll be too  weak to keep them. And as a result, you'll find less identity and less community.

Unless you see  these three promises that Jesus made, Peter saw them and it changed him forever. He looked away from  himself to Jesus the promise keeper. What were those three? Well, let me just mention them. Jesus  promised a judge.

Jesus promised to die. And Jesus promised to forgive. We've got to have them all. I'm just going to tick them off. Number one, his promise to judge.

Jesus Christ says, Peter, I'm in  charge. You live, you die, you die, you live. Don't you understand? I'm in charge. I am the judge of all the  earth.

And even though some of you might suffer terribly from keeping a promise, you know, here,  let's just take a look at one promise that you're supposed to make as a Christian to always sell  the truth. Somebody, you know, here's a person who tells the truth and the boss says, I don't like it,  but you've got guts. You're promoted. So here's another Christian. And this other Christian says,  okay, I know I'm a Christian.

I'm going to tell the truth. I know one thing probably. I tell the  truth. And the boss says, I don't like it. You're fired.

Right? Wait a minute, Peter says, you know,  why is it that I keep a promise I killed and John's going to keep the promise and he's going to live? Why is it? Jesus says, don't you understand? I'm the judge.

In the end, everything's going to be  set straight. Nobody's going to get away with anything. Listen, friends, unless you have  an understanding, a hopeful view of history in the future, unless you understand that there is a  God who no matter what promise keeping costs you in the short run, in the end, truth and justice  and compassion and righteousness and goodness, the things that you hold to and the things that you  base your life on when you make a promise, when you make a promise to God, say, those things are  ultimate realities. In this world, sometimes those things mean you'll take it on the chin,  but we know that this world isn't the only world there is. We know there's a bigger world.

We know  that that's the reason why Peter's able to say, in second Peter 3, we wait according to promise  because we know that he is going to judge and the right and the true and the just and the  compassionate and the love and goodness, the things that we base our life on, those are ultimate  realities. They're going to triumph and therefore those of us who hold to them, we're going to triumph,  too. If you don't understand that, what use is there to keep a promise? They put it another way. Remember those baby boomers?

You remember this old enough to remember this commercial? There was  a beer commercial that used to say, you only go around once in life. So you got to grab for all the  gusto you can. You remember that? I can't even remember which one it was.

I mean, maybe it was only on  Philadelphia television. I don't know. You only go around once in life. You got to grab for all the  gusto you can. That is the most hopeless possible view of history.

It's hopeless. Why? You're saying  is the only happiness you'll ever get is right here because when life is over, you're dead. And of course, when the sun is over, everything's dead and everything will go up and flames. You cannot possibly expect to keep promises if you believe your life is an accident and eventually  everything is going to burn up in the death of the sun.

Why in the world would you keep a promise? The very nature of promise keeping is delayed gratification. Why in the world would you  delay your gratification if this life is all there is? Jesus says, don't you understand? You keep  take a make a promise and you lose your job.

You make a promise and you get promoted. But I've  been charged. Everything will be even doubt. It is only temporary that sometimes the promise  keeping brings you down. I am the judge way according to promise.

That's the first promise. Secondly,  and most importantly, his promise to die. His promise to die. You heard what I said. If you were here one week when the folks joined the church  all the way through the Bible again and again and again.

God says, if you are faithful to me,  I'll be faithful to you. If you are committed to me, I'll be committed to you again and again and again. Something happened on the cross that never happened before and will never happen again. Someone Jesus Christ went to the cross and against all of the powers of darkness and against all  of his own feelings. He shrank at the possibility of going to the cross.

You know why he had a human  nature? In the garden, he said, not my will, but thine be done. You know what he meant? Even though he  was a perfect human being, he still was a human being. His divine nature knew exactly where he should go,  but his human nature was scared to death.

He was afraid of dying. He knew what he was going to go  through. He knew the torment. How did he keep his human and divine nature together? With a promise,  he said, not my will, but thine be done.

I've bound myself to the program. I'm going to do it. He was a person of integrity because he stuck with a promise. Hebrews 10 says that when Jesus came into the world, he says,  low, it is written of me in the book. I come to do the I will.

I come to offer myself a sacrifice. He remembers the promise. That's how he gets to the cross, but on the cross,  he says, my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Now wait a minute. What's going on?

How could that possibly be? God always says, if you break promises, you'll be alone. But if you make promises, you'll find people around you. If you break a promise to me,  you're separated from me. But if you make a promise to me, if you keep a promise to me,  then I will be with you.

But now look what happens. Here's the first time in the history of the world, and the only time it'll ever happen,  that God said that Jesus Christ, if you keep my promise, if you keep this promise to me,  I will forsake you. And on the cross, Jesus was absolutely and utterly alone. Do you know why? We're told in Leviticus 16, on the day of Atonement, once a year,  that people of Israel would do something about the fact they've been breaking their promises  all year.

Every year you break promises to God. You say, I'm going to love my neighbor  with myself. Nobody does that. You say, I'm going to love you and obey you. Nobody does that.

So once a year, they have the day of Atonement, and you know what they did on the day of Atonement? Listen, once a year, the high priest would take a live goat. This is Leviticus 16,  and lay both hands on the head of a live goat and confess over all the wickedness and rebellion,  all the covenant breaking, all the promise breaking of the Israelites. And he would put them on the  goat's head, and he shall send the goat away into the desert. And the goat will carry on  itself all their sins into a solitary place.

You know why? The goat is being treated as the promise  breaker. Promise breakers go out. Promise breakers are on the outside. Promise breakers are in the  desert.

Promise breakers are utterly alone. And on the cross, Jesus became that scapegoat. And that's  why the writer of the Hebrews in chapter 13 actually says it wasn't an accident where Jesus was  crucified. He suffered outside the gate that he might redeem us with his blood. Jesus Christ  was such a promise breaker that he was willing, he was such a promise keeper.

He was willing to  go to the cross. But now here's what's so weird. He was such a promise keeper that he was willing  to be treated as the ultimate promise breaker so that you and I could become promise keepers. He was sent out. He says, my God, my God, you forsaken me.

I'm alone in the dark. There is nothing between me and the fire of your utter rejection. It's pouring out into the  core of my being. Why is it being treated like that? He's being treated as a promise breaker.

You know what's so weird? Here's Peter warming himself with the fire in the courtyard. Here's  Jesus tortured. Why? Jesus is the promise breaker.

Peter is the promise breaker. Peter is being substituted for. Jesus is taking the curse that belongs to Peter and you and  I are Peter. Do you see it? Now, find your friends unless you see, and this brings us to the end,  the third thing you have to see is Jesus then is able to come to Peter at that fire and he's able  to say, Peter, do you love me?

Three times. And Peter repents because he has to say, I love you three  times to kind of make up for the denial. And then what does he say? Jesus says, in that case,  you can still be a leader of mine. You can still be a leader.

I'm going to put you back in charge. What? How? You say, if promise breaking is so bad and promise keeping is so important,  how can he do that? Because Jesus says now, don't you say, Peter, what you did wrong the first time?

You think that your identity is really bound up in your promise keeping. I'll know a Christian's  identity comes from Jesus' promise keeping. If you think you can save yourself through promise  keeping, you'll be a promise breaker just like Peter. Peter felt he could save himself by being a  really committed person. And so he picked it up in fear and pride.

And because he picked it up in fear  and pride, when he saw his weakness, he was in despair. But a Christian, here's what's so ironic,  if you understand that you are not saved by your promise keeping, but by Jesus' promise keeping. When you pick up a promise, you will break it. You're a sinner, but when you break it,  you won't be able to deny it. You repent.

And a repentant promise breaker is a promise keeper. You won't be in despair. Your identity will not fall apart because you'll say, he forgives. He loves me not because I have been the promise keeper, but because he was the promise keeper. And because of that, here's the great irony, here's the paradox.

When you break a promise  and you know you're a sinner saved by grace, you can repent quickly and that brings you right back  into where you were before. You don't make excuses. You're not denying and you're back in promise keeping. The people who best keep their promises to God are the people who know they can't. The people who best keep their promises to God and grow  are the people who know that they are loved, not because they're promise keepers,  because Jesus is.

You know where that leaves you? Some of you are afraid to make promises. That's why you're in New York. That's why some of you won't even date. That's why some of you  don't have many friends.

That's why some of you don't lay yourself out into people's lives. That's  why some of you never join a church. You're afraid of commitment. Don't you see? He's the judge.

Don't be scared. And he died. He took your penalty. He was willing to keep a promise  like that. Why can't you keep promises for him?

On the other hand, some of you by the way are too  quick to make promises. That's just as bad. You know why? You can see now that if you're too quick  to make promises, and you make so many promises, you find they contradict each other. You promise  this personist and this personist, this personist, and then you can't actually come up with it  and you have to back out and you have to repent.

Don't you see? Promise keeping is so important  that those of you who are afraid to make them need to start making more committed. But promise  keeping is so important that some of you who over-promise and who over-commit you need to start  pulling back because promise keeping is a divine thing. You're just a little lower than God  when you make promises and you make covenants and you mustn't do them so quickly. Almost everybody  in this room goes one way or the other.

But most of all, if right now you're thinking about  doing something disobedient. You made a promise to God. I'm not going to lie. I'm going to be  faithful to my spouse. You know, I'm going to stay chased till marriage.

You know, whatever,  you make promises based on law of God right now if you're afraid  that you're about to pull out. Oh, gee, look at what it cost him to keep his promise for you  and when he did, he was blasted. Now, what's it going to cost you to keep your promise for him? Nothing like it. Nothing like it.

God says to Jesus, if you keep your promise for me,  I'll abandon you. But you know what he says to you? He says, if you keep that promise,  even though it'll be hard, if you tell that truth, if you do that right thing, if you keep that  promise, I'll be with you. I'll envelop you. I'll descend on you.

It's the exact opposite of  what he said to Jesus, but Jesus kept his promise for you. Can't you keep your promise for him? In Jesus Christ, all the promises of God are yay and amen. Let's be like him. Let's pray.

We father, we ask that you'd grant to us now the possibility. People, men and women of integrity,  men and women who are not too quick but not too slow to make commitments and to do so because  your son did. Make us people of our word, make us people of honesty, let the world look in  that this community and be amazed at the truth spoken in love here, at the promises made to  commitment. The way people give their money, the way people give their time, the way people  give their hearts, people who are not afraid to be committed to one another. Make us people like  that because we're seeing your son, the great promise keeper in Jesus' name will pray.

Amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today's message, Tim Keller explores the human condition through stories in the Bible,  uncovering what Scripture says about sin and why it's the only explanation deep enough  to face the truth about ourselves. Recently, there was an inner church meeting of Christian men in the city called Promise  Keepers. I got a chance to speak at it. The most unflattering way to put it, the most  unflattering way to explain that movement is to try to make Christian men make and keep  more promises, make and keep more commitments. It was interesting that at that time, I was  already preparing a sermon on the issue of integrity and Peter, and this incident here  tells us, especially the case of Peter, tells us more about the power of commitments and  the power of promise keeping.

I think any other incident in the Scripture. Let me read  it to you. Peter was sitting out in the courtyard and a servant girl came to him. You also  were with Jesus of Galilee, she said, but he denied it before them all. I don't know what  you're talking about, he said.

Then he went out to the gateway where another girl saw  him and said to the people there, this fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth. He denied it again  with an oath. I don't know the man. After a little while, those standing there went  up to Peter and said, surely you are one of them. For your accent gives you a way.

Then  he began to call down curses on himself and he swore to them, I don't know the man. Immediately  a rooster crowed and then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken. Before the  rooster crowed, you will disown me three times and he went outside and wept bitterly. This  is God's word. You see, earlier in the chapter, at the last supper, Jesus had turned to Peter.

That's what the reference is there in verse 74. Jesus had turned to Peter and said, Peter,  before the nights out, you're going to betray me. You're going to deny me three times. Three  times, before the rooster crowed that dawn, you will deny that you even know me. And Peter said,  at that point, up in verse 35, Peter said, even if I have to die, I will never disown you.

That's a promise. That's a commitment. Peter says, even if it means my life, I will never  disown you. And yet, by verse 73, 74, 75, he's doing it. In verse 35, he made a promise  that 40 verses later he's breaking the promise.

And we're told in verse 75, and this is what I want  to look at in particular with you, he went out and wept bitterly. You went out and he wept bitterly. Not just he wept bitterly. Why? He was an absolutely broken man in the profoundest possible way.

And yet within weeks, within weeks, he was poised as the leader of a new movement, the Christian  movement that was about to change history, and he was about to become one of the most influential  leaders in the history of the world. What broke him like this and then what restored him so quickly  and the answer is the same. And that is promises. What broke him was he did not understand the power  of promises. What restored him was he learned the secret.

See, he didn't understand the power of  promise breaking, but then he after that he learned the secret of promise keeping. And promises  is the reason he was broken and promises is the reason he was restored. And I'm going to just  propose to you that the bitterness of our lives, see Peter went out and went bitterly that a lot of  the bitterness of our lives comes from our inability to make or keep promises, to make or keep commitments. Now, when I use the word promises during the rest of this talk, the rest of this sermon, I don't  want people to immediately think of formal contracts. There's a place in the sermon on the  mount where Jesus says, I say unto you, don't swear at all, but let your yes be s and let your no be  no.

Now, a lot of people have misinterpreted that as meaning Jesus saying never take a vow. That's  not what he means. He says, don't swear, but let your yes be s and your no be no. What he means is  a Christian should be someone that every yes and every no, everything you say you ought to treat  as a commitment. Whether or not you say I promise, whether or not you sign on a dotted line, whether  or not you make it formal, there are not there are not to be degrees of integrity in my people,  says Jesus.

There's not supposed to be levels of commitment. If you say to somebody, I'll pray  for you. If you say to somebody, I'll call you. If you say to somebody, I'll look you up. If you say to somebody, I'll look in on you.

Jesus says, that's a commitment. Christians, my people are supposed to be people of their word, people who are dependable, people of  integrity. See, so promise keeping to Jesus is not just mean the ones where you say, I promise,  where you put your hand up in the air. Let's take a look at what Peter learned  and we'll look at it under two heavens. The first heading is, how promises  make us and then the second heading is, how we can make promises.

How promises make us and then  how we can make promises. First, how promises make us, this is the power of promises. Why was it that  Peter went out and wept bitterly? Because promises make identity and they make community. Did you hear  that?

They make identity and they make community without promises, without commitment, without the  willingness to make a commitment to deny yourself, to limit your options and to hold yourself to  a course of action that you stick with no matter what. That's a commitment. That's a promise. Without promises, there's no identity and there's no community and Peter lost both of them at the  moment. This is what promises make us.

First of all promises make identity. Why was Peter wept  so bitterly? I'll tell you why he didn't know who he was. You know why he didn't know who he was? Am I the Peter?

He thought of verse 35 or am I the Peter of verse 74? Which Peter's the real Peter? I don't know. My life isn't fragments because I couldn't keep a promise. Promises give identity.

See, when you ask a modern person what, who are you really? What is your identity? Another way to  put it is who are you really? Modern people tend to say it's my desires and my feelings that tell  me who I really am. That's who I am.

My deepest desires. There's an awful lot of talk still,  though I hope eventually it will go, you know, it'll pass away. The last 20 years has been a lot of  talk about people saying I need to find myself. I need to find out who I am. And usually in modern  parlance it means I need to get out from under all responsibilities, all promises, all obligations,  all covenants.

I've got to get away from all obligations and find out what I really feel like so  I can find out who I am. Because most modern people say who I am is my deepest feelings. But boy, I hope, you know the reason I hope that this is going to pass away because I'm hoping that  baby boomers are getting older. Because as you get older you begin to realize that your desires,  your feelings are not only in conflict with each other but they're even in conflict with  themselves, they're in flux. My deepest desires, that who I am but my deepest desires are in conflict  with each other.

Not only that, they don't even line up with themselves over period of time,  they change. It doesn't work. I mean look, what are your deepest desires? We all want the security  of having somebody who's always there for us what we like to freedom to play the field. You want security and you want freedom in the area of love.

You want security and you want freedom in  the area of work. You like the security of having money, but you like the freedom of an unstructured  life without, you know, the disciplines of a career. If you're looking to see what you deep,  most deeply desire, you'll see that they're at odds with each other. Peter wanted to be the leader  of the Christian movement. He also wanted to live.

And, you know, in the past, you know, those are both  desires. I would like to survive. I would like to not be tortured. I would also like to be a great  leader and they came together. Who's Peter?

You say, well, it's your deepest desire. Who knows  what your deepest desire is? One desire has the ascension for a moment. Another desire has the  ascension for the next moment. Here's Peter.

He really wanted to live. That's a desire. And he really  wanted to be a leader. Who is Peter? You say, well, his deepest desire probably was to be a leader.

No, his deepest desire at the moment was to be a coward. Is that all he is? What I'm trying to  say is your feelings cannot possibly be the core of your identity because, by definition, your  identity has to be that unchangeable core to yourself. That's always the same. By definition,  an identity has to be something which a core of sameness about you that is always the same  no matter what the circumstances and no matter what the feelings and no matter what the year.

That's what an identity is. Therefore, you are not your feelings because your feelings  are always changed. It means whatever you're committed to, you are your commitments, you are your  promises. If you aren't, if instead in every situation, in every, you following your six  circumstances and you're following the impulses, you'll never know who you are and nobody else will  either because there's nothing that you always are. Your identity is what you always are.

If there's nothing that you that you can say, I always am that because I'm committed to that  and no matter how I feel, no matter what the situation is, no matter what the circumstances are,  no matter what people say, I'm committed to that. Unless you've got something like that,  you don't know who you are. There's no identity without promises. Now, this isn't just my idea. Hanna Arrent, not exactly, you know, you're born again minister.

Hanna Arrent, quite a theorist,  quite a political analyst, she says, in one of her writings, she says this,  without being bound to the fulfillment of our promises, we would never be able to keep an identity. We'd be condemned to wander helplessly without direction and a darkness of each person's heart caught  in its contradictions and equivocalities. You hear her? She says, in your heart,  it's filled with contradictions and equivocalities. You'd have no identity unless you are bound to  promises.

See, Peter could have kept his life together. How do you keep your life together? Peter could have said, I am he, who will be there with you, Lord Jesus, regardless of public  or private, regardless of hard times or easy times, and the promise would have been the thread  that bound him together, all of his pieces, all of his parts. That's what integrity is. The word integrity is the same as our English word integer, which in mathematics means a whole  number is opposed to fraction, right?

And in the same way, how can you be sure that you are  a person of integrity? That means that you are not living your life in fragments or in compartments. How can you be the same a whole person? How can you be the same in public as in private? How can you be the same with one crowd as with another crowd?

How can you be the same on Mondays  you are on Sunday? How can you be the same in what you say and what you do? How can you be the same  from one year to the next? How can you be the same? Only by a promise that pulls it all together.

Otherwise, it's my glands, it's my feelings, it's my circumstances, it's public opinion, it's all  these things. Remember, you know, did you see the movie with Bridget Fonda, Nicholas Cage? It could  happen to you. It's about a cop, a near cop that promises a waitress that if his this lottery ticket  wins, since she made a contribution to it, he'd come back and give her half the winnings. Then he  finds out he won four million dollars.

His wife, when he hears, she hears about the promise to the  to the waitress says, forget that. It's not in writing, it's not written down anywhere, four million  dollars. You'd be an idiot to go back and he says a promise is a promise and he goes back and he  gives the waitress two million dollars. And one thing that's interesting throughout the rest of the  film, his wife, you know, the cop's wife who wants nothing but the money and has no other  principles than that, goes through multiple transformations of personality and finally collapses. But even though he really pays a price for sticking with his promise, he has a sense of himself  and it lasts throughout.

And of course, the best place for this is ever said is in that wonderful  play, that wonderful line in man for all seasons where Sir Thomas Moore is being told he's going  to burn at the stake unless he recants. And his daughter says, oh please father, his daughter's name is  Meg can't you please just go back on your word so that we can have you. And he looks at her and he  says when a man makes an oath, Meg, he holds his own self in his hand like water. And if he opens his  fingers, he needn't hope to find himself again. You know why Peter's weeping bitterly?

He opened his  hand and he was gone. If you say, well, I got principles, but if it doesn't look like it'd be  advantageous to tell the truth. If it doesn't look like it'll be comfortable to do this thing. Well, I'm a pragmatist. You open your hand and there's nothing left.

How does Peter know who he is? He has no idea. He doesn't have a promise that binds together every part of his life. Is he a Christian or isn't he? Is he for Christ or isn't he?

He doesn't know nobody knows. He can't even trust himself now. He's got no identity. Promises make identity, but also one other  thing we have to be brief, but important promises make community. You notice where he goes to weep  out.

You see that? Doesn't say, look he says he went outside and wept bitterly. That is not  not. That is not just an accident. That is not an unimportant statement.

He went outside and wept. Well, you know why? You say, well, yeah, it's common sense. When you've broken a promise,  when you have broken faith, when you've made a commitment and then you give up on the commitment,  you don't say to everybody, hey, let's gather around. I want to weep.

No, you go away. You're alone  because promises create community. There is no community without commitment. For 10 years, I ministered in a small town in the south and there were two men that almost virtually  wandered the street. They weren't exactly homeless, but they almost were.

They were born and raised  there and they were related to half this town, but they never kept promises. They repeatedly kept  breaking their promises. As a result, nobody trusted them and they had no friends. They had a lot  of relics. They had nobody who would be there with them because they were never there for anybody  else.

I don't like that. They couldn't even trust themselves. The inevitable consequence, the  inevitable result of breaking commitments or even failing to make them is aloneness, isolation,  being on the outside. See, in New York, excuse me, I run into people all the time who say,  of course, I don't make promises. Ask me no questions.

I'll tell you no lies. I keep my options open. I'm not going to make commitments. I'm not going to get stuck. I'm going to do that, which will  maximize pleasure and profit.

So I just want you to know who I am upfront. I don't make commitments  to people. I don't make promises to people. In other words, watch your back when you're around me. Look,  when you have a city like that, you don't have a city, you have a jungle.

And that's increasing  in the case, is it not? Because if you say, I'm not going to be there for others. I'm not going  to make commitments. To make a commitment is to say, I narrow my options. You can't be a friend  unless you narrow your options.

Instead of doing what you want to do tonight, you need to go  over and see that friend because you know that friend's going through something. I don't want to go  through it. I'd rather go do something else, but he's my friend. She's my friend. You have no  friendship.

You have no community without narrowing your options. Without saying, I've got a program  and I'm going to stick with it, regardless of what Lewis Meads is a man who wrote a terrific article  on promising. And he has this great line in it. He says, my wife has been married to five different  men since her wedding day. And every one of them has been me.

Because he's an old man. He's  writing after they've been married for over 50 years. And in other words, he's talking about how  much he's changed over the years. He says, my wife's been married to five different men. Everyone  has been me.

But connecting the connecting link that bound each of those men into an integrated  hole was the promise I made on my wedding day. That promise gives me an identity. And that identity  is I am he who will be there with you. If I ever shed that name, if I ever broke that promise,  I'd never find myself again. And the bond that connects us would break as well.

How is the wife over 50 years going to be able to have a relationship with a man who's changing so  much and vice versa? Of course, he's writing from the mail point of view. He says the only way that  she's been able to know is because of my promise. If I break that promise, there's no community. Why should she ever trust me again?

Why should I trust myself again? If I leave her to go off  with another woman, why should that woman have any confidence that I won't do the same thing to  her? And why should I even think that I will have any confidence that I wouldn't do it again? I open my hand, nothing there, and I'm alone. Always, always, always, the result of promise  breaking outside, weeping bitterly, looking around, no one there, including me.

Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache. We feel it in the world  around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way and what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing this month, what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers  a clear and compassionate answer.

Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer,  Dr. Keller shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us  and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of  our world, struggling with your own mistakes or choices, or looking for hope and joy,  what is wrong with the world will help you see how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our  world and the pain within each of us. This newly released book, What Is Wrong with the World,  is our thanks for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the good news of Jesus.

That's gospelandlife.com slash give. Now that's how promises make us. There is no society without people who make commitments and stick  with them. There is no families without it. You know what a family is?

A family is when two people  get together and they dare to make this promise. We're going to raise little ones until they're big  enough to care for themselves. And if you dare to make that promise, we're going to do it no matter  how they act. We're going to do it no matter how they treat us. If you don't dare to make that  promise, you don't have a family.

And you only have a family as long as you're keeping that promise. There's no society. There's no family. There's no marriage. There's no community.

There's no  friendship without being willing to rein your own heart in and say, I'm making a point with myself  and appointment with myself five years from now, I'm still going to be there for you. Now question, how can we make promises then? If promises make us, how can we make promises? And  here's why a lot of you are asking this question. I know you're saying, I got problems here.

I've  got real problems with what you're saying. You seem to make it sound so simple, but it's not. On the one hand, when you make promises, people take advantage of you. I've made promises and I've been burned. People have taken advantage of me.

I'm afraid to make  promises now. New York is full of people, as far as I can see, that have been burned by old promises  and who have said, I'm going to be much more careful the next time I do it, if ever. And then on the other hand, you've got other people who say, the other problem I've got is when I  do make promises, I can't stick with them. I can't stick with them. I'm like Peter, I break down.

I  can't follow through. But here's the secret. And you have to look at the whole story of Peter to  understand. In John chapter 21, Jesus comes and restores Peter. And in that passage, he just does  this.

I can give you synopsis. He does something. First of all, he sits Peter down at a fire. And three times he says, Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me? Peter says, yes, I do.

And then he asks him again, do you love me? And he says, yes, I do. And a third time, three  denials, three questions. Do you love me? And he says, yes, I do.

And after each time, what does Jesus  say? I want you to be a leader of my sheep. I want you to feed and lead my flock just like before. Before you broke the promise, I still want you to lead. I'm going to make you a good leader.

But he says to Peter, by the way, you ought to know that if you keep this promise to me now,  this new promise you're making, you're going to be killed. You know, you probably would have been  killed if you kept it the first time. Well, now that you've made it again, you're going to be killed  anyway. He says, the way he puts it is he says, you'll stretch your hands out on a cross. You'll  be crucified too.

And Peter turns to John, the apostle who's right next to him and he says,  what about him, Lord? And Jesus looks at Peter and says, what if I decide that you're going to  be killed, but he's not? What business is that of yours? Don't you know who I am? Follow me.

Now, what Peter is told there, you might say, what happened there? Because from then on, Peter was  a promise keeper. From then on, Peter kept his word. From then on, Peter became a tremendous leader. He became a man of identity and community because he kept his commitments because he made the  bigger your commitments you make, that you're dare to make and the better you keep him, the more  of a sense of self you've got and the more incredible friends you've got.

Don't you see that? It's a scary thing to start a church, but the people who got together and said, we're going  to start this church even though it's going to cost us an awful lot. There's a community there. See, the more the promise, the greater the promise, and Peter went on and he experienced the identity  in the community. Well, why?

How could that possibly be? And here's the answer. He saw Jesus as a  promise keeper. Instead of looking at himself, instead of saying, I can do it. You know, will power.

I can make the promise. I can do it. I know I can. Instead of drawing strength from will power and  looking at himself, he saw Jesus as a promise keeper. He saw three promises that Jesus made.

And I say to you, unless you see the same three promises, you'll never be a promised keeper. You won't be able to be too scared to make commitments, like those of you who've been burned,  and you'll be too weak to keep commitments. You'll be too scared to make them. You'll be too  weak to keep them. And as a result, you'll find less identity and less community.

Unless you see  these three promises that Jesus made, Peter saw them and it changed him forever. He looked away from  himself to Jesus the promise keeper. What were those three? Well, let me just mention them. Jesus  promised a judge.

Jesus promised to die. And Jesus promised to forgive. We've got to have them all. I'm just going to tick them off. Number one, his promise to judge.

Jesus Christ says, Peter, I'm in  charge. You live, you die, you die, you live. Don't you understand? I'm in charge. I am the judge of all the  earth.

And even though some of you might suffer terribly from keeping a promise, you know, here,  let's just take a look at one promise that you're supposed to make as a Christian to always sell  the truth. Somebody, you know, here's a person who tells the truth and the boss says, I don't like it,  but you've got guts. You're promoted. So here's another Christian. And this other Christian says,  okay, I know I'm a Christian.

I'm going to tell the truth. I know one thing probably. I tell the  truth. And the boss says, I don't like it. You're fired.

Right? Wait a minute, Peter says, you know,  why is it that I keep a promise I killed and John's going to keep the promise and he's going to live? Why is it? Jesus says, don't you understand? I'm the judge.

In the end, everything's going to be  set straight. Nobody's going to get away with anything. Listen, friends, unless you have  an understanding, a hopeful view of history in the future, unless you understand that there is a  God who no matter what promise keeping costs you in the short run, in the end, truth and justice  and compassion and righteousness and goodness, the things that you hold to and the things that you  base your life on when you make a promise, when you make a promise to God, say, those things are  ultimate realities. In this world, sometimes those things mean you'll take it on the chin,  but we know that this world isn't the only world there is. We know there's a bigger world.

We know  that that's the reason why Peter's able to say, in second Peter 3, we wait according to promise  because we know that he is going to judge and the right and the true and the just and the  compassionate and the love and goodness, the things that we base our life on, those are ultimate  realities. They're going to triumph and therefore those of us who hold to them, we're going to triumph,  too. If you don't understand that, what use is there to keep a promise? They put it another way. Remember those baby boomers?

You remember this old enough to remember this commercial? There was  a beer commercial that used to say, you only go around once in life. So you got to grab for all the  gusto you can. You remember that? I can't even remember which one it was.

I mean, maybe it was only on  Philadelphia television. I don't know. You only go around once in life. You got to grab for all the  gusto you can. That is the most hopeless possible view of history.

It's hopeless. Why? You're saying  is the only happiness you'll ever get is right here because when life is over, you're dead. And of course, when the sun is over, everything's dead and everything will go up and flames. You cannot possibly expect to keep promises if you believe your life is an accident and eventually  everything is going to burn up in the death of the sun.

Why in the world would you keep a promise? The very nature of promise keeping is delayed gratification. Why in the world would you  delay your gratification if this life is all there is? Jesus says, don't you understand? You keep  take a make a promise and you lose your job.

You make a promise and you get promoted. But I've  been charged. Everything will be even doubt. It is only temporary that sometimes the promise  keeping brings you down. I am the judge way according to promise.

That's the first promise. Secondly,  and most importantly, his promise to die. His promise to die. You heard what I said. If you were here one week when the folks joined the church  all the way through the Bible again and again and again.

God says, if you are faithful to me,  I'll be faithful to you. If you are committed to me, I'll be committed to you again and again and again. Something happened on the cross that never happened before and will never happen again. Someone Jesus Christ went to the cross and against all of the powers of darkness and against all  of his own feelings. He shrank at the possibility of going to the cross.

You know why he had a human  nature? In the garden, he said, not my will, but thine be done. You know what he meant? Even though he  was a perfect human being, he still was a human being. His divine nature knew exactly where he should go,  but his human nature was scared to death.

He was afraid of dying. He knew what he was going to go  through. He knew the torment. How did he keep his human and divine nature together? With a promise,  he said, not my will, but thine be done.

I've bound myself to the program. I'm going to do it. He was a person of integrity because he stuck with a promise. Hebrews 10 says that when Jesus came into the world, he says,  low, it is written of me in the book. I come to do the I will.

I come to offer myself a sacrifice. He remembers the promise. That's how he gets to the cross, but on the cross,  he says, my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Now wait a minute. What's going on?

How could that possibly be? God always says, if you break promises, you'll be alone. But if you make promises, you'll find people around you. If you break a promise to me,  you're separated from me. But if you make a promise to me, if you keep a promise to me,  then I will be with you.

But now look what happens. Here's the first time in the history of the world, and the only time it'll ever happen,  that God said that Jesus Christ, if you keep my promise, if you keep this promise to me,  I will forsake you. And on the cross, Jesus was absolutely and utterly alone. Do you know why? We're told in Leviticus 16, on the day of Atonement, once a year,  that people of Israel would do something about the fact they've been breaking their promises  all year.

Every year you break promises to God. You say, I'm going to love my neighbor  with myself. Nobody does that. You say, I'm going to love you and obey you. Nobody does that.

So once a year, they have the day of Atonement, and you know what they did on the day of Atonement? Listen, once a year, the high priest would take a live goat. This is Leviticus 16,  and lay both hands on the head of a live goat and confess over all the wickedness and rebellion,  all the covenant breaking, all the promise breaking of the Israelites. And he would put them on the  goat's head, and he shall send the goat away into the desert. And the goat will carry on  itself all their sins into a solitary place.

You know why? The goat is being treated as the promise  breaker. Promise breakers go out. Promise breakers are on the outside. Promise breakers are in the  desert.

Promise breakers are utterly alone. And on the cross, Jesus became that scapegoat. And that's  why the writer of the Hebrews in chapter 13 actually says it wasn't an accident where Jesus was  crucified. He suffered outside the gate that he might redeem us with his blood. Jesus Christ  was such a promise breaker that he was willing, he was such a promise keeper.

He was willing to  go to the cross. But now here's what's so weird. He was such a promise keeper that he was willing  to be treated as the ultimate promise breaker so that you and I could become promise keepers. He was sent out. He says, my God, my God, you forsaken me.

I'm alone in the dark. There is nothing between me and the fire of your utter rejection. It's pouring out into the  core of my being. Why is it being treated like that? He's being treated as a promise breaker.

You know what's so weird? Here's Peter warming himself with the fire in the courtyard. Here's  Jesus tortured. Why? Jesus is the promise breaker.

Peter is the promise breaker. Peter is being substituted for. Jesus is taking the curse that belongs to Peter and you and  I are Peter. Do you see it? Now, find your friends unless you see, and this brings us to the end,  the third thing you have to see is Jesus then is able to come to Peter at that fire and he's able  to say, Peter, do you love me?

Three times. And Peter repents because he has to say, I love you three  times to kind of make up for the denial. And then what does he say? Jesus says, in that case,  you can still be a leader of mine. You can still be a leader.

I'm going to put you back in charge. What? How? You say, if promise breaking is so bad and promise keeping is so important,  how can he do that? Because Jesus says now, don't you say, Peter, what you did wrong the first time?

You think that your identity is really bound up in your promise keeping. I'll know a Christian's  identity comes from Jesus' promise keeping. If you think you can save yourself through promise  keeping, you'll be a promise breaker just like Peter. Peter felt he could save himself by being a  really committed person. And so he picked it up in fear and pride.

And because he picked it up in fear  and pride, when he saw his weakness, he was in despair. But a Christian, here's what's so ironic,  if you understand that you are not saved by your promise keeping, but by Jesus' promise keeping. When you pick up a promise, you will break it. You're a sinner, but when you break it,  you won't be able to deny it. You repent.

And a repentant promise breaker is a promise keeper. You won't be in despair. Your identity will not fall apart because you'll say, he forgives. He loves me not because I have been the promise keeper, but because he was the promise keeper. And because of that, here's the great irony, here's the paradox.

When you break a promise  and you know you're a sinner saved by grace, you can repent quickly and that brings you right back  into where you were before. You don't make excuses. You're not denying and you're back in promise keeping. The people who best keep their promises to God are the people who know they can't. The people who best keep their promises to God and grow  are the people who know that they are loved, not because they're promise keepers,  because Jesus is.

You know where that leaves you? Some of you are afraid to make promises. That's why you're in New York. That's why some of you won't even date. That's why some of you  don't have many friends.

That's why some of you don't lay yourself out into people's lives. That's  why some of you never join a church. You're afraid of commitment. Don't you see? He's the judge.

Don't be scared. And he died. He took your penalty. He was willing to keep a promise  like that. Why can't you keep promises for him?

On the other hand, some of you by the way are too  quick to make promises. That's just as bad. You know why? You can see now that if you're too quick  to make promises, and you make so many promises, you find they contradict each other. You promise  this personist and this personist, this personist, and then you can't actually come up with it  and you have to back out and you have to repent.

Don't you see? Promise keeping is so important  that those of you who are afraid to make them need to start making more committed. But promise  keeping is so important that some of you who over-promise and who over-commit you need to start  pulling back because promise keeping is a divine thing. You're just a little lower than God  when you make promises and you make covenants and you mustn't do them so quickly. Almost everybody  in this room goes one way or the other.

But most of all, if right now you're thinking about  doing something disobedient. You made a promise to God. I'm not going to lie. I'm going to be  faithful to my spouse. You know, I'm going to stay chased till marriage.

You know, whatever,  you make promises based on law of God right now if you're afraid  that you're about to pull out. Oh, gee, look at what it cost him to keep his promise for you  and when he did, he was blasted. Now, what's it going to cost you to keep your promise for him? Nothing like it. Nothing like it.

God says to Jesus, if you keep your promise for me,  I'll abandon you. But you know what he says to you? He says, if you keep that promise,  even though it'll be hard, if you tell that truth, if you do that right thing, if you keep that  promise, I'll be with you. I'll envelop you. I'll descend on you.

It's the exact opposite of  what he said to Jesus, but Jesus kept his promise for you. Can't you keep your promise for him? In Jesus Christ, all the promises of God are yay and amen. Let's be like him. Let's pray.

We father, we ask that you'd grant to us now the possibility. People, men and women of integrity,  men and women who are not too quick but not too slow to make commitments and to do so because  your son did. Make us people of our word, make us people of honesty, let the world look in  that this community and be amazed at the truth spoken in love here, at the promises made to  commitment. The way people give their money, the way people give their time, the way people  give their hearts, people who are not afraid to be committed to one another. Make us people like  that because we're seeing your son, the great promise keeper in Jesus' name will pray.

Amen.

### 中文翻译

今天的信息中,提姆·凯勒通过圣经中的故事探讨人的本性,揭示圣经对罪的论述,以及为什么它是唯一足够深刻的解释,让我们能够面对关于自己的真相。最近,在这座城市举行了一场名为"守约者"的基督徒男性聚会。我有机会在会上讲话。用最不讨喜的方式来说,这场运动最不讨喜的解释就是试图让基督徒男性做出并遵守更多的承诺,做出并遵守更多的委身。有趣的是,那时我已经在准备一篇关于诚信和彼得的讲道,这里的这个事件,特别是彼得的案例,告诉我们更多关于承诺的力量和守约的力量。

我认为圣经中任何其他事件都无法与之相比。让我读给你们听。彼得坐在外面的院子里,有一个使女前来对他说:"你也与加利利人耶稣同伙的。"彼得在众人面前却不承认,说:"我不知道你说的是什么。"

后来他出去,到了门口,又有一个使女看见他,就对那里的人说:"这个人也是与拿撒勒人耶稣一伙的。"彼得又不承认,并且起誓说:"我不认识那个人!"过了不多的时候,旁边站着的人前来对彼得说:"你真是他们一党的,你的口音把你露出来了。"

彼得就开始发咒起誓地说:"我不认识那个人!"立时,鸡就叫了。彼得想起耶稣所说的话:"鸡叫以先,你要三次不认我。"他就出去痛哭。这是神的话语。你看,在这章的前面,在最后的晚餐上,耶稣转向彼得。这就是74节那里提到的。耶稣转向彼得说:"彼得,在今晚结束之前,你会背叛我。你会三次不认我。在黎明鸡叫之前,你会三次否认你认识我。"彼得当时说,在第35节,彼得说:"我就是必须和你同死,也总不能不认你。"

这是一个承诺。这是一个委身。彼得说,即使这意味着我的生命,我也绝不会不认你。然而,到了73、74、75节,他却这样做了。在第35节,他做了一个承诺,40节经文之后,他就违背了这个承诺。

我们在75节看到,这是我特别想和你们一起看的,他就出去痛哭。他出去痛哭。不只是痛哭。为什么?他是一个以最深刻的方式彻底破碎的人。

然而在几周之内,几周之内,他就被定位为一个新运动的领袖,这个即将改变历史的基督教运动,他即将成为世界历史上最有影响力的领袖之一。是什么让他如此破碎,又是什么如此迅速地恢复了他?答案是一样的。那就是承诺。打破他的是他不理解承诺的力量。恢复他的是他学会了秘诀。看,他不理解违背承诺的力量,但在那之后,他学会了守约的秘诀。承诺是他破碎的原因,承诺也是他得以恢复的原因。我只想向你们提出,我们生活中的痛苦,看彼得出去痛哭,我们生活中的许多痛苦来自于我们无法做出或遵守承诺,无法做出或遵守委身。现在,当我在这次讲道的其余部分使用"承诺"这个词时,我不希望人们立即想到正式的合同。在登山宝训中有一处,耶稣说:"我告诉你们,什么誓都不可起。你们的话,是就说是,不是就说不是。"

现在,很多人误解了这句话,以为耶稣是说永远不要立誓。那不是他的意思。他说,不要起誓,但你们的话,是就说是,不是就说不是。他的意思是,基督徒应该是这样的人:你说的每一个"是"和每一个"不是",你说的每一件事都应该被当作一个承诺。无论你是否说"我保证",无论你是否在虚线上签名,无论你是否正式化,在我的子民中不应该有不同程度的诚信,耶稣说。不应该有不同层次的委身。如果你对某人说:"我会为你祷告。"如果你对某人说:"我会给你打电话。"如果你对某人说:"我会去看你。"如果你对某人说:"我会去看望你。"

耶稣说,这就是一个承诺。基督徒,我的子民应该是说话算数的人,可靠的人,有诚信的人。看,所以在耶稣看来,守约不仅仅是指那些你说"我保证"的时候,你把手举在空中的时候。让我们来看看彼得学到了什么,我们将在两个标题下看它。第一个标题是,承诺如何塑造我们,第二个标题是,我们如何能够做出承诺。

承诺如何塑造我们,然后我们如何能够做出承诺。首先,承诺如何塑造我们,这就是承诺的力量。为什么彼得出去痛哭?因为承诺塑造身份,它们塑造群体。你听到了吗?

它们塑造身份,它们塑造群体。没有承诺,没有委身,没有愿意做出承诺来否定自己,限制你的选择,并坚持一条无论如何都要坚持的行动路线。这就是委身。这就是承诺。没有承诺,就没有身份,就没有群体,彼得在那一刻失去了这两者。这就是承诺塑造我们的方式。

首先,承诺塑造身份。为什么彼得哭得如此痛苦?我告诉你为什么,他不知道自己是谁。你知道他为什么不知道自己是谁吗?我是第35节的彼得吗?

还是我是第74节的彼得?哪个彼得是真正的彼得?我不知道。我的生活支离破碎,因为我无法遵守承诺。承诺给予身份。

看,当你问一个现代人,你是谁?你的身份是什么?换一种说法就是,你到底是谁?现代人倾向于说,是我的欲望和我的感受告诉我我真正是谁。那就是我是谁。我最深的欲望。过去20年有很多关于这方面的谈论,虽然我希望最终它会消失,你知道,它会过去。很多人说我需要找到自己。我需要找出我是谁。通常在现代用语中,这意味着我需要摆脱所有的责任、所有的承诺、所有的义务、所有的盟约。

我必须摆脱所有的义务,找出我真正的感受,这样我才能找出我是谁。因为大多数现代人说我是谁就是我最深的感受。但是,我希望,你知道我为什么希望这会消失,因为我希望婴儿潮一代正在变老。因为随着年龄的增长,你开始意识到你的欲望、你的感受不仅相互冲突,而且甚至与自身冲突,它们在不断变化。我最深的欲望,那就是我是谁,但我最深的欲望彼此冲突。不仅如此,它们甚至在一段时间内与自己不一致,它们会改变。这行不通。我的意思是,看,你最深的欲望是什么?我们都想要有人总是在那里陪伴我们的安全感,我们喜欢在爱情中自由地玩耍。你在爱情领域想要安全感,也想要自由。你在工作领域想要安全感,也想要自由。你喜欢有钱的安全感,但你也喜欢没有职业纪律的自由、不受束缚的生活。如果你想看看你最深的欲望是什么,你会发现它们彼此矛盾。彼得想成为基督教运动的领袖。他也想活下去。

而且,你知道,在过去,你知道,这两者都是欲望。我想活下去。我不想被折磨。我也想成为一个伟大的领袖,它们走到了一起。彼得是谁?你说,嗯,这是你最深的欲望。谁知道你最深的欲望是什么?一个欲望在某一刻占据上风。另一个欲望在下一刻占据上风。这是彼得。

他真的想活下去。那是一个欲望。他也真的想成为领袖。彼得是谁?你说,嗯,他最深的欲望可能是成为领袖。不,他当时最深的欲望是当懦夫。那就是他的全部吗?我想说的是,你的感受不可能成为你身份的核心,因为,根据定义,你的身份必须是你自己那个不变的核心。那永远是一样的。根据定义,身份必须是关于你的某种东西,它有一个不变的核心,无论环境如何,无论感受如何,无论年份如何,它总是一样的。

这就是身份。因此,你不是你的感受,因为你的感受总是在变化。这意味着无论你委身于什么,你就是你的委身,你就是你的承诺。如果你不是,如果相反,在每一种情况下,在每一种情况下,你跟随你的六种环境,你跟随冲动,你永远不会知道你是谁,别人也不会知道,因为没有什么是你永远都是的。你的身份就是你永远都是的东西。

如果没有什么你可以说,我永远都是那个,因为我委身于那个,无论我感觉如何,无论情况如何,无论环境如何,无论人们说什么,我都委身于那个。除非你有这样的东西,否则你不知道自己是谁。没有承诺就没有身份。现在,这不只是我的想法。汉娜·阿伦特,不完全是,你知道,你的重生牧师。

汉娜·阿伦特,相当出色的理论家,相当出色的政治分析家,她在她的一篇著作中说,她说:"如果不受履行承诺的约束,我们将永远无法保持身份。我们将被迫无助地徘徊,没有方向,陷入每个人内心的黑暗中,陷入其中的矛盾和模棱两可之中。"你听到她说的话了吗?她说,在你心里,充满了矛盾和模棱两可。除非你受承诺的约束,否则你就没有身份。看,彼得本可以保持他的生活完整。你如何保持你的生活完整?彼得本可以说,我就是那个无论公开还是私下,无论困难时期还是轻松时期,都会与你同在的人,主耶稣,这个承诺本会是将他所有的碎片、所有的部分联系在一起的线索。这就是诚信。诚信这个词与我们英语中的整数(integer)相同,在数学中指的是整数,而不是分数,对吧?

同样,你怎么能确定你是一个有诚信的人?这意味着你的生活不是支离破碎或分隔的。你怎么能成为一个完整的人?你怎么能在公开场合和私下场合都一样?你怎么能在一群人面前和在另一群人面前都一样?你怎么能在周一和周日都一样?你怎么能在言行上都一致?你怎么能年复一年都一样?你怎么能一样?只有通过一个将一切联系在一起的承诺。

否则,就是我的腺体、我的感受、我的环境、公众舆论,所有这些东西。记得吗,你知道,你看过布里奇特·方达和尼古拉斯·凯奇的电影吗?《这事发生在你身上》。这是关于一个警察,一个接近警察的人,他向一个女服务员承诺,如果他的这张彩票中奖了,由于她为此做出了贡献,他会回来给她一半的奖金。然后他发现他赢得了四百万美元。当他的妻子听到关于对女服务员的承诺时,她说,忘了那个。这不是书面的,没有写下来,四百万美元。

你回去就是个白痴。他说,承诺就是承诺,然后他回去给了女服务员两百万美元。电影中有一件有趣的事,他的妻子,你知道,这个警察的妻子,除了钱什么都不要,除此之外没有其他原则,经历了多次人格转变,最终崩溃了。但即使他为坚持承诺付出了真正的代价,他仍然有一种自我意识,并且贯穿始终。

当然,这方面说得最好的地方是在那部精彩的戏剧中,《日月风云》中那句精彩的台词,托马斯·莫尔爵士被告知,除非他收回自己的话,否则他将被烧死在火刑柱上。他的女儿说,哦,求你了,父亲,他女儿的名字叫梅格,你就不能收回你的话,这样我们就能留住你吗?他看着她说,梅格,当一个人起誓时,他把自己握在手中,就像水一样。如果他张开手指,他就不要指望再找到自己。你知道彼得为什么痛哭吗?

他张开了手,他就消失了。如果你说,嗯,我有原则,但如果说真话看起来不利。如果做这件事看起来不舒服。嗯,我是个实用主义者。你张开手,什么都没有了。

彼得怎么知道他是谁?他不知道。他没有一个能将他生活的每一部分联系在一起的承诺。他是基督徒还是不是?他支持基督还是不支持?他不知道,没人知道。他现在甚至不能相信自己。他没有身份。承诺塑造身份,但还有一件重要的事,我们必须简短说明,但很重要,承诺塑造群体。你注意到他去哪里哭泣了吗?出去。

你看到了吗?没有说,看,它说他出去痛哭。那不是,那不只是一个巧合。那不是一个不重要的陈述。

他出去痛哭。嗯,你知道为什么吗?你说,嗯,是的,这是常识。当你违背了承诺,当你违背了信任,当你做出了承诺然后放弃了承诺,你不会对所有人说,嘿,大家聚过来。我要哭了。

不,你离开。你孤独,因为承诺创造群体。没有委身就没有群体。十年来,我在南方的一个小镇服事,有两个人几乎在街上游荡。他们并不完全是无家可归,但几乎是。他们在那里出生和长大,他们与这个镇的一半人有亲属关系,但他们从不遵守承诺。他们一再违背承诺。结果,没有人信任他们,他们没有朋友。他们有很多遗物。他们没有人会与他们在一起,因为他们从不为别人在那里。

我不喜欢那样。他们甚至不能相信自己。违背承诺或甚至未能做出承诺的必然后果,必然结果就是孤独、孤立、在外面。看,在纽约,对不起,我经常遇到这样的人,他们说,当然,我不做承诺。不要问我问题。我不会对你说谎。我保持我的选择开放。我不会做出承诺。我不会被困住。我要做那些能最大化快乐和利益的事。

所以我只想让你提前知道我是谁。我不对人做出承诺。我不向人承诺。换句话说,当你在我身边时,要小心你的背后。看,当你有这样一座城市时,你没有一座城市,你有一片丛林。

而且这种情况越来越多,不是吗?因为如果你说,我不会为别人在那里。我不会做出承诺。做出承诺就是说,我缩小我的选择。除非你缩小你的选择,否则你不能成为朋友。

今晚不做你想做的事,你需要去看看那个朋友,因为你知道那个朋友正在经历一些事情。我不想经历它。我宁愿去做别的事,但他是我的朋友。她是我的朋友。你没有友谊。

没有缩小选择就没有群体。没有说,我有一个计划,我要坚持它,无论如何,路易斯·米德是一个写了一篇关于承诺的精彩文章的人。他在文章中有这样一句伟大的话。他说,自从她的婚礼那天起,我的妻子已经嫁给了五个不同的男人。每一个都是我。

因为他是一个老人。他在结婚超过50年后写的。换句话说,他在谈论他这些年来变化有多大。他说,我的妻子嫁给了五个不同的男人。每一个都是我。

但将这些男人联系成一个完整整体的纽带是我在婚礼那天做出的承诺。那个承诺给了我一个身份。那个身份就是,我是那个会与你在一起的人。如果我放弃了那个名字,如果我违背了那个承诺,我就再也找不到自己了。联系我们的纽带也会断裂。

超过50年,妻子如何能够与一个变化如此之大的男人建立关系,反之亦然?当然,他是从男性的角度写的。他说,她能够知道的唯一方式是因为我的承诺。如果我违背那个承诺,就没有群体。她为什么要再信任我?

我为什么要相信自己?如果我离开她去和另一个女人在一起,那个女人为什么要有任何信心我不会对她做同样的事?我为什么要认为我会有任何信心我不会再做一次?我张开手,那里什么都没有,我孤独。总是,总是,总是,违背承诺的结果就是在外面,痛哭,环顾四周,那里没有人,包括我。

我们到处看到破碎、战争、残酷和心痛。我们在周围的世界和我们自己的生活中感受到它。它是如何变成这样的,能做些什么?在他本月发行的全新书籍《世界到底出了什么问题?》中,提姆·凯勒提供了一个清晰而富有同情心的答案。

根据在救赎主教会的一系列教导,凯勒博士展示了罪的现实如何解释我们周围看到的痛苦,以及只有福音才能提供持久的自由和医治。无论你是被我们世界的状况压垮,还是在与自己的错误或选择斗争,或是在寻找希望和喜乐,《世界到底出了什么问题?》都将帮助你看到福音如何同时对我们世界的心痛和我们每个人内心的痛苦说话。这本新发行的书《世界到底出了什么问题?》是我们对你本月捐赠的感谢,帮助"福音与生活"分享耶稣的好消息。今天就在gospelandlife.com/give请求你的副本。这就是gospelandlife.com/give。现在,这就是承诺如何塑造我们。没有做出承诺并坚持承诺的人,就没有社会。没有它就没有家庭。你知道家庭是什么吗?

家庭是当两个人聚在一起,他们敢于做出这个承诺。我们要抚养小孩子,直到他们长大到能够照顾自己。如果你敢做出那个承诺,我们会做到,无论他们如何行事。我们会做到,无论他们如何对待我们。如果你不敢做出那个承诺,你就没有家庭。

你只有在遵守那个承诺的时候才有家庭。没有社会。没有家庭。没有婚姻。没有群体。

没有友谊,除非愿意约束自己的心,说,我在五年后与自己有一个约定,我仍然会为你在那里。现在的问题是,那么我们如何能够做出承诺?如果承诺塑造我们,我们如何能够做出承诺?这就是为什么你们很多人在问这个问题。我知道你们在说,我在这里有问题。

我对你说的话有真正的问题。你似乎让它听起来很简单,但事实并非如此。一方面,当你做出承诺时,人们会利用你。我做过承诺,我被伤害过。人们利用过我。

我现在害怕做出承诺。纽约充满了这样的人,据我所见,他们被旧承诺伤害过,他们说,下次我会更加小心,如果有的话。然后另一方面,你有其他人说,我遇到的另一个问题是,当我做出承诺时,我无法坚持它们。我无法坚持它们。我就像彼得,我崩溃了。

我无法坚持到底。但这里有秘诀。你必须看彼得的整个故事才能理解。在约翰福音第21章,耶稣来恢复彼得。在那段经文中,他只是这样做。

我可以给你概要。他做了一些事。首先,他让彼得坐在火边。三次他说,西门,约翰的儿子,你爱我吗?彼得说,是的,我爱。

然后他又问,你爱我吗?他说,是的,我爱。第三次,三次否认,三个问题。你爱我吗?他说,是的,我爱。

每次之后,耶稣说什么?我要你成为我羊群的领袖。我要你喂养和带领我的羊群,就像以前一样。在你违背承诺之前,我仍然要你领导。我要让你成为一个好领袖。

但他对彼得说,顺便说一下,你应该知道,如果你现在对我遵守这个承诺,这个你正在做的新承诺,你会被杀。你知道,如果你第一次遵守它,你可能会被杀。嗯,现在你又做出了承诺,无论如何你都会被杀。他说,他这样说,你会在十字架上伸出双手。你也会被钉十字架。

彼得转向约翰,就在他旁边的使徒,他说,主啊,那他呢?耶稣看着彼得说,如果我决定你会被杀,但他不会呢?那与你何干?你不知道我是谁吗?跟从我。

现在,彼得在那里被告知的,你可能会说,那里发生了什么?因为从那时起,彼得就是一个守约者。从那时起,彼得遵守他的话。从那时起,彼得成为了一位了不起的领袖。他成为了一个有身份和群体的人,因为他遵守了他的承诺,因为他做出了更大的承诺,你做出的承诺越大,你敢于做出并遵守得越好,你的自我意识就越强,你拥有的朋友就越不可思议。

你不明白吗?开始一个教会是一件可怕的事情,但那些聚在一起说,我们要开始这个教会,即使它会让我们付出很大代价的人。那里有一个群体。看,承诺越多,承诺越大,彼得继续前进,他经历了身份和群体。嗯,为什么?

这怎么可能?答案就在这里。他看到耶稣是一个守约者。他没有看自己,没有说,我能做到。你知道,意志力。我可以做出承诺。我能做到。我知道我能。他没有从意志力中汲取力量,没有看自己,而是看到耶稣是一个守约者。他看到耶稣做出的三个承诺。

我对你说,除非你看到同样的三个承诺,否则你永远不会成为守约者。你无法做到,因为你会太害怕做出承诺,就像你们那些被伤害过的人,你会太软弱而无法遵守承诺。你会太害怕做出它们。你会太软弱而无法遵守它们。结果,你会发现更少的身份和更少的群体。

除非你看到耶稣做出的这三个承诺,彼得看到了它们,它永远改变了他。他从自己身上移开目光,看向守约者耶稣。那三个是什么?嗯,让我提一下它们。耶稣承诺审判。耶稣承诺受死。

耶稣承诺赦免。我们必须全部拥有它们。我只是要逐一说明它们。第一,他审判的承诺。耶稣基督说,彼得,我掌权。你活,你死,你死,你活。你不明白吗?我掌权。我是全地的审判者。

即使你们中的一些人可能会因遵守承诺而遭受可怕的苦难,你知道,这里,让我们看看你作为基督徒应该做出的一个承诺,总是说真话。某人,你知道,这是一个说真话的人,老板说,我不喜欢,但你有勇气。你被提升了。所以这是另一个基督徒。这个基督徒说,好的,我知道我是基督徒。我要说真话。我知道一件事可能。我说真话。

老板说,我不喜欢。你被解雇了。

对吗?等等,彼得说,你知道,为什么我遵守承诺就被杀,而约翰要遵守承诺却要活下来?为什么?耶稣说,你不明白吗?我是审判者。最终,一切都会被纠正。没有人会逃脱任何事。听着,朋友们,除非你有一个理解,一个对历史和未来充满希望的观点,除非你明白有一位上帝,无论守约在短期内让你付出什么代价,最终,真理、公义、怜悯、正义和良善,当你做出承诺时你所坚持的事情,当你向上帝做出承诺时你所依据的事情,说,这些事情是终极现实。在这个世界上,有时这些事情意味着你会受到打击,但我们知道这个世界不是唯一的世界。我们知道有一个更大的世界。

我们知道这就是为什么彼得能够说,在彼得后书第3章,我们根据承诺等待,因为我们知道他将要审判,正确的、真实的、公正的、富有怜悯的、爱和良善,我们生活所依据的事情,这些是终极现实。它们将要胜利,因此我们这些坚持它们的人,我们也将要胜利。如果你不明白这一点,遵守承诺有什么用?换个方式说。记得那些婴儿潮一代吗?

你还记得这个广告吗,如果你足够大的话?有一个啤酒广告曾经说,人生只有一次。所以你要尽力抓住所有的精彩。你记得吗?我甚至不记得是哪一个了。我的意思是,也许它只在费城电视上播出。我不知道。人生只有一次。你要尽力抓住所有的精彩。这是对历史最绝望的看法。

这是绝望的。为什么?你说的是你唯一会得到的幸福就在这里,因为当生命结束时,你就死了。当然,当太阳结束时,一切都死了,一切都会在火焰中上升。如果你相信你的生命是一个意外,最终一切都会在太阳的死亡中燃烧殆尽,你就不可能期望遵守承诺。为什么你会遵守承诺?守约的本质就是延迟满足。如果这一生就是一切,你为什么要延迟你的满足?耶稣说,你不明白吗?你遵守承诺,你失去工作。你做出承诺,你得到提升。但我掌权。一切最终都会平衡。

只是暂时的,有时守约会让你失望。我是审判者,根据承诺等待。这是第一个承诺。其次,也是最重要的,他受死的承诺。他受死的承诺。你听到我说的了。如果你在一周前在这里,当人们加入教会时,贯穿整本圣经,一遍又一遍又一遍。上帝说,如果你对我忠诚,我就对你忠诚。如果你对我委身,我就对你委身,一遍又一遍又一遍。十字架上发生了一件以前从未发生过、以后也不会再发生的事。有人,耶稣基督,走向十字架,对抗所有黑暗的力量,对抗他自己所有的感受。他在走向十字架的可能性面前退缩了。

你知道他为什么有人性吗?在园子里,他说,不要成就我的意思,只要成就你的意思。你知道他是什么意思吗?即使他是一个完美的人,他仍然是一个人。他的神性确切地知道他应该去哪里,但他的人性害怕死亡。他害怕死亡。他知道他要经历什么。他知道折磨。他如何保持他的人性和神性在一起?通过一个承诺,他说,不要成就我的意思,只要成就你的意思。

我已经将自己绑定到这个计划。我要去做。他是一个有诚信的人,因为他坚持承诺。希伯来书第10章说,当耶稣来到世界时,他说,看哪,经上记着我的事,我来了为要照你的旨意行。我来献上自己为祭物。他记得承诺。这就是他如何到达十字架的,但在十字架上,他说,我的上帝,我的上帝,你为什么离弃我?现在等等。发生了什么事?

这怎么可能?上帝总是说,如果你违背承诺,你会孤独。但如果你做出承诺,你会发现人们在你身边。如果你对我违背承诺,你就与我分离。但如果你对我做出承诺,如果你对我遵守承诺,那么我就会与你同在。但现在看看发生了什么。这是世界历史上第一次,也是唯一一次,上帝对耶稣说,如果你为我遵守承诺,我会离弃你。在十字架上,耶稣绝对彻底地孤独。你知道为什么吗?利未记第16章告诉我们,在赎罪日,一年一次,以色列人会对他们一年来违背承诺的事实做些什么。

每年你都违背对上帝的承诺。你说,我要爱邻舍如同自己。没有人这样做。你说,我要爱你、顺服你。没有人这样做。所以一年一次,他们有赎罪日,你知道他们在赎罪日做什么吗?听着,一年一次,大祭司会取一只活山羊。这是利未记第16章,将双手按在活山羊的头上,承认所有的罪恶和悖逆,所有违背盟约、所有违背承诺的以色列人的罪。

他会将它们放在山羊的头上,他要把山羊送到旷野去。山羊将承担它们所有的罪到一个荒凉的地方。

你知道为什么吗?山羊被当作违背承诺的人对待。违背承诺的人出去。违背承诺的人在外面。违背承诺的人在旷野。违背承诺的人完全孤独。在十字架上,耶稣成为了那只替罪羊。这就是为什么希伯来书第13章的作者实际上说,耶稣被钉十字架的地方不是偶然的。他在城门外受苦,好用他的血救赎我们。耶稣基督是这样一个违背承诺的人,以至于他愿意,他是这样一个守约者。

他愿意去十字架。但现在这里有一些很奇怪的事。他是这样一个守约者,以至于他愿意被当作终极的违背承诺者对待,这样你和我就能成为守约者。他被送出去。他说,我的上帝,我的上帝,你离弃了我。我在黑暗中孤独。在我和你彻底拒绝的烈火之间什么都没有。它倾泻到我存在的核心。为什么他被这样对待?他被当作违背承诺的人对待。

你知道什么很奇怪吗?这是彼得在院子里的火边取暖。这是耶稣被折磨。为什么?耶稣是违背承诺的人。彼得是违背承诺的人。彼得被替代了。耶稣承受了属于彼得的咒诅,你和我就是彼得。你明白了吗?现在,找到你的朋友,除非你看到,这把我们带到结尾,你必须看到的第三件事是耶稣然后能够在那火边来到彼得面前,他能够说,彼得,你爱我吗?

三次。彼得悔改了,因为他必须说,我爱你三次,来弥补否认。然后他说什么?耶稣说,在这种情况下,你仍然可以成为我的领袖。你仍然可以成为领袖。

我要让你重新掌权。什么?怎么做?你说,如果违背承诺是如此糟糕,守约是如此重要,他怎么能这样做?因为耶稣说,现在,你不说吗,彼得,你第一次做错了什么?你认为你的身份真的与你的守约联系在一起。我知道基督徒的身份来自耶稣的守约。如果你认为你可以通过守约拯救自己,你就会成为一个违背承诺的人,就像彼得一样。彼得觉得他可以通过成为一个真正有承诺的人来拯救自己。所以他在恐惧和骄傲中接受了它。

因为他在恐惧和骄傲中接受了它,当他看到自己的软弱时,他就绝望了。但一个基督徒,这里有一些讽刺的是,如果你明白你不是通过你的守约得救,而是通过耶稣的守约。当你接受一个承诺时,你会违背它。你是一个罪人,但当你违背它时,你将无法否认它。你悔改。

一个悔改的违背承诺的人就是一个守约者。你不会绝望。你的身份不会崩溃,因为你会说,他赦免了。他爱我,不是因为我一直是守约者,而是因为他是守约者。正因为如此,这里有一个巨大的讽刺,这里有一个悖论。当你违背承诺,你知道你是一个蒙恩得救的罪人,你可以迅速悔改,这会让你回到你以前所在的地方。你不会找借口。你不会否认,你就回到了守约中。最能遵守对上帝的承诺的人是那些知道自己做不到的人。最能遵守对上帝的承诺并成长的人是那些知道他们被爱,不是因为他们是守约者,因为耶稣是守约者的人。

你知道这会让你在哪里吗?你们有些人害怕做出承诺。这就是为什么你在纽约。这就是为什么你们有些人甚至不会约会。这就是为什么你们有些人没有很多朋友。这就是为什么你们有些人不会将自己投入到人们的生活中。这就是为什么你们有些人从不加入教会。你害怕承诺。你不明白吗?他是审判者。

不要害怕。他死了。他承受了你的刑罚。他愿意遵守这样的承诺。为什么你不能为他遵守承诺?

另一方面,顺便说一下,你们有些人太快做出承诺。这同样糟糕。你知道为什么吗?你现在可以看到,如果你太快做出承诺,你做出了太多承诺,你会发现它们彼此矛盾。你向这个人承诺这个,向这个人承诺这个,向这个人承诺这个,然后你实际上无法兑现,你必须退出,你必须悔改。

你不明白吗?守约是如此重要,以至于你们那些害怕做出承诺的人需要开始做出更多的承诺。但守约是如此重要,以至于你们有些人过度承诺、过度委身,你们需要开始收回,因为守约是一件神圣的事。当你做出承诺、立下盟约时,你只是比上帝略低一点,你不能太快地做这些。这个房间里几乎每个人都会走一条路或另一条路。

但最重要的是,如果现在你正在考虑做一些不顺服的事。你向上帝做了承诺。我不会说谎。我会对我的配偶忠诚。你知道,我会保持贞洁直到婚姻。

你知道,无论什么,你基于上帝律法做出承诺,现在如果你害怕你即将退出。哦,天啊,看看他为你遵守承诺付出了什么代价,当他这样做时,他被摧毁了。现在,你为他遵守承诺要付出什么代价?一点也不像。一点也不像。

上帝对耶稣说,如果你为我遵守承诺,我会离弃你。但你知道他对你说什么吗?他说,如果你遵守那个承诺,即使会很艰难,如果你说那个真相,如果你做那件正确的事,如果你遵守那个承诺,我会与你同在。我会包围你。我会降临在你身上。这与他对耶稣说的完全相反,但耶稣为你遵守了他的承诺。你不能为他遵守你的承诺吗?在耶稣基督里,上帝的所有承诺都是肯定的,阿们。让我们像他一样。让我们祷告。

我们的父,我们祈求你现在赐予我们这种可能性。人们,有诚信的男人和女人,不太快但也不太慢做出承诺的男人和女人,这样做是因为你的儿子做了。让我们成为说话算数的人,让我们成为诚实的人,让世界看到这个群体,对这里在爱中说出的真理、对所做的承诺、对委身感到惊讶。人们给予金钱的方式,人们给予时间的方式,人们给予心的方式,不害怕彼此委身的人。让我们成为那样的人,因为我们看到了你的儿子,那伟大的守约者,奉耶稣的名祷告。

阿们。

在今天的信息中，提姆·凯勒通过圣经中的故事探讨人类的处境，揭示圣经对罪的论述，以及为什么唯有罪才能深刻地解释我们面对自己真相的原因。最近，城里举行了一场名为"守约者"的基督徒男性教会聚会。我有机会在那里讲话。用最不讨好的方式来说，解释那场运动最不讨好的方式就是试图让基督徒男性做出并遵守更多承诺，做出并遵守更多委身。有趣的是，那时我已经在准备一篇关于诚信和彼得的讲道，这里的这个事件，特别是彼得的案例，告诉我们更多关于承诺的力量和守约的力量。

我认为这是圣经中任何其他事件都无法相比的。让我读给你们听。彼得坐在外面的院子里，一个使女来到他面前。"你也曾和加利利人耶稣同在，"她说，但他在众人面前否认了。"我不知道你在说什么，"他说。

然后他走到门口，另一个女孩看见他，对那里的人说："这个人也曾和拿撒勒人耶稣同在。"他又一次否认了，并且起誓说："我不认识那个人。"过了一会儿，站在那里的人走到彼得面前说："你肯定是他们中的一个。因为你的口音把你暴露了。"

然后他开始咒诅自己并向他们起誓："我不认识那个人。"立刻，鸡叫了。然后彼得想起了耶稣所说的话。"鸡叫以前，你要三次不认我。"他就出去，痛哭起来。这是神的话语。你看，在本章早些时候，在最后的晚餐上，耶稣转向彼得。这就是第74节那里所引用的。耶稣转向彼得说："彼得，天亮之前，你要背叛我。你要三次不认我。在黎明鸡叫之前，你要三次否认你甚至认识我。"彼得当时说，在第35节，彼得说："即使我必须死，我也永远不会不认你。"

这是一个承诺。这是一个委身。彼得说，即使这意味着我的生命，

我绝不会否认你。然而,到了73、74、75节,他却正在这样做。在35节,他立下了一个誓言,而40节经文之后,他就打破了这个誓言。

我们在75节看到——这也是我特别想与你们一起探讨的——他就出去痛哭。他出去痛哭。不仅仅是他痛哭。为什么?他是一个在最深层意义上完全破碎的人。

然而几周之内,仅仅几周之内,他就成为了一个新运动——即将改变历史的基督教运动——的领袖,他即将成为世界历史上最具影响力的领袖之一。是什么使他如此破碎,又是什么如此迅速地恢复了他?答案是同一个。那就是承诺。使他破碎的是他不理解承诺的力量。使他恢复的是他学会了这个秘密。

你看,他不理解违背承诺的力量,但后来他学会了遵守承诺的秘密。承诺是他破碎的原因,承诺也是他恢复的原因。我要向你们提出的是,我们生命中的苦涩——看彼得出去痛哭——我们生命中的许多苦涩来自于我们无法做出或遵守承诺,无法做出或遵守委身。现在,当我在这次讲道的其余部分使用"承诺"这个词时,我不希望人们立刻想到正式合同。在登山宝训中有一处,耶稣说:"我告诉你们,什么誓都不可起,但你们的话,是就说是,不是就说不是。"

现在,很多人误解了这句话,以为耶稣是在说永远不要起誓。那不是他的意思。他说,不要起誓,但你们的话,是就说是,不是就说不是。他的意思是,一个基督徒应该是这样的人:每一个"是"和每一个"不是",你说的每一句话,你都应该将其视为一个承诺。无论你是否说"我承诺",无论你是否在虚线上签字,无论你是否使其正式化,在我的子民中不应该有不同程度的诚信,耶稣说。

不应该有不同层次的委身。如果你对某人说,我会为你祷告。

如果你对某人说,我会给你打电话。如果你对某人说,我会去看你。如果你对某人说,我会去拜访你。

耶稣说,那就是一个承诺。基督徒,我的子民应当是信守诺言的人,是可靠的人,是正直的人。所以,对耶稣来说,守诺不仅仅指那些你说"我保证"的承诺,不仅仅指那些你举手发誓的承诺。让我们来看看彼得学到了什么,我们将在两个标题下来看这个问题。第一个标题是,承诺如何塑造我们,第二个标题是,我们如何做出承诺。

承诺如何塑造我们,以及我们如何做出承诺。首先,承诺如何塑造我们——这就是承诺的力量。为什么彼得出去痛哭?因为承诺造就身份认同,承诺造就群体。你听到了吗?

承诺造就身份认同,承诺造就群体。没有承诺,没有委身,没有做出承诺的意愿——否定自己、限制自己的选择、让自己坚守某个行动方向,无论遇到什么都坚持下去。这就是委身。这就是承诺。没有承诺,就没有身份认同,也没有群体,而彼得在那一刻两者都失去了。这就是承诺对我们的塑造。

首先,承诺造就身份认同。为什么彼得哭得如此痛苦?我告诉你为什么——他不知道自己是谁。你知道他为什么不知道自己是谁吗?我到底是35节那个彼得,还是74节那个彼得?哪个彼得才是真正的彼得?我不知道。我的生命支离破碎,因为我无法守住一个承诺。承诺赋予身份。

你看,当你问一个现代人"你是谁?你的身份是什么?"换句话说就是"你真正是谁?"现代人往往会说,是我的欲望和我的感受告诉我我真正是谁。那就是我。我最深层的欲望。在过去二十年里,仍然有很多这样的说法——虽然我希望最终它会消逝——很多人说我需要找到自己。我需要找出我是谁。而在现代话语中,这通常意味着我需要摆脱所有的责任、所有的承诺、所有的义务,

所有的盟约。

我必须摆脱所有的义务和约束，去找出我真正的感受是什么，这样我才能找到真正的自我。因为大多数现代人说，我是谁取决于我最深层的感受。但是，你知道吗，我希望这种观念会过去，因为我盼望着婴儿潮一代正在变老。因为随着年龄的增长，你会开始意识到，你的欲望、你的感受不仅彼此冲突，甚至与它们自身也在冲突，它们处于不断变化之中。我最深层的欲望，那就是我是谁——但我最深层的欲望彼此之间是冲突的。

不仅如此，它们甚至无法在一段时间内保持一致，它们会改变。这行不通。我的意思是，看看你最深层的欲望是什么？我们都想要有一个人永远陪伴我们的安全感，但我们也想要自由地到处游玩。在爱情领域，你既想要安全感，又想要自由。

在工作领域，你也想要安全感和自由。你喜欢有钱带来的安全感，但你又喜欢不受约束的生活的自由，不想要职业生涯所需的那些纪律。如果你想看看自己最深层的欲望是什么，你会发现它们彼此矛盾。彼得想成为基督教运动的领袖。他也想活命。

而且，你知道，在过去，你知道，这些都是欲望。我想活下去。我不想被折磨。我也想成为一位伟大的领袖——这些欲望交织在一起。彼得是谁？

你说，嗯，是你最深层的欲望。谁知道你最深层的欲望是什么？某个欲望在此刻占据上风，另一个欲望在下一刻占据上风。看看彼得。

他真的想活命。那是一种欲望。而他也真的想成为一位领袖。彼得是谁？你说，嗯，他最深层的欲望可能是成为一位领袖。

不，他当时最深层的欲望是做个懦夫。难道他就只是这样吗？我想说的是，你的感受不可能成为你身份的核心，因为从定义上来说，你的身份必须是你自身那个不变的核心。它永远是一样的。从定义上来说，身份必须是某种核心

的相同性，无论环境如何、无论感受如何、无论年份如何，总有一些关于你的东西是始终如一的。

这就是身份认同。因此，你不是你的感受，因为你的感受总是在变化。这意味着无论你委身于什么，你就是你的委身，你就是你的承诺。如果不是这样，如果你在每种情况下，在每个时候，都只是跟随你的环境、跟随你的冲动，你将永远不知道自己是谁，别人也不会知道，因为没有什么是你始终如一的。你的身份认同就是你始终如一的那些东西。

如果没有什么东西可以让你说："我始终是这样的，因为我委身于此，无论我感觉如何、无论情况如何、无论环境如何、无论人们说什么，我都委身于此。" 除非你有这样的东西，否则你不知道自己是谁。没有承诺就没有身份认同。现在，这不仅仅是我的想法。汉娜·阿伦特，她可不是什么重生的牧师。

汉娜·阿伦特，一位非常有名的理论家、政治分析家，她在她的一篇著作中说，她说："如果不受履行承诺的约束，我们将永远无法保持身份认同。我们将注定在无助中漂泊，没有方向，陷入每个人内心的黑暗中，困在其中的矛盾和模棱两可之中。" 你听到她说什么了吗？她说，在你的心里，充满了矛盾和模棱两可。除非你受到承诺的约束，否则你就没有身份认同。

你看，彼得本可以保持他生命的完整。你如何保持生命的完整呢？彼得本可以说："我就是那个无论公开还是私下、无论艰难时刻还是安逸时刻都会与你同在的人，主耶稣。" 而这个承诺本可以成为把他捆绑在一起的线，把他所有的碎片、所有的部分都连在一起。这就是正直。正直(integrity)这个词与我们英语中的整数(integer)一词相同，在数学中，整数是指完整的数字，而不是分数，对吧?

同样地,你如何能确定你是一个有正直的人呢？这意味着你不是在碎片中生活,也不是在

的分裂状态。你怎样才能成为一个完整的人？你怎样才能在公开场合和私下里保持一致？你怎样才能在不同的人群面前保持一致？

你怎样才能在周一和周日保持一致？你怎样才能在言行上保持一致？你怎样才能年复一年地保持一致？你怎样才能保持一致？只有通过一个把一切整合在一起的承诺。

否则，就会被腺体、感觉、环境、舆论，以及所有这些东西左右。还记得吗，你看过那部布里奇特·方达和尼古拉斯·凯奇主演的电影吗？《真情赌注》（It Could Happen to You）。讲的是一个警察，因为一个女服务员为他的彩票出了一份力，他承诺如果中奖就回来给她一半奖金。然后他发现自己中了四百万美元。

当他的妻子听说他对女服务员的承诺时，她说，别管那个了。又没有白纸黑字写下来，这可是四百万美元。你要是回去给她就是个傻瓜。但他说，承诺就是承诺，然后他回去给了那个女服务员两百万美元。整部电影中有一个很有意思的地方，那个警察的妻子，她只想要钱，除此之外没有任何原则，她的性格经历了多次转变，最终崩溃了。而他虽然为坚守承诺付出了沉重的代价，却始终有一种自我认同，这种认同贯穿始终。

当然，这方面最经典的表达出现在那部精彩的戏剧《良相佐国》（A Man for All Seasons）中那句精彩的台词里。托马斯·莫尔爵士被告知，除非他收回自己的话，否则就要被烧死在火刑柱上。他的女儿说，哦，求求你了，父亲——他女儿的名字叫梅格——你就不能收回你说的话吗，这样我们就能留住你了。他看着她说："梅格，当一个人发誓时，他就像把自己握在手中，如同握着水。如果他张开手指，就别指望能再次找回自己。"你知道彼得为什么痛哭吗？

他张开了手，自己就消失了。如果你说，嗯，我有原则，但如果看起来不太

说真话有利可图的时候就说真话。如果做这件事看起来不会让人舒服,那么,我是个实用主义者。你摊开手掌,里面什么都没有了。

彼得怎么知道自己是谁?他完全不知道。他没有一个承诺可以把他生命的每个部分联结在一起。他到底是不是基督徒?他到底是支持基督还是不支持?

他不知道,没有人知道。他现在甚至无法信任自己了。他失去了身份认同。承诺塑造身份,但还有另一件事——我们必须简短,但很重要——承诺塑造群体。你注意到他去哪里哭泣了吗?

看到了吗?经文没有说,看,它说他到外面去痛哭。这不是——不是。这不只是偶然的细节。这不是一句不重要的话。

他到外面去哭泣。嗯,你知道为什么吗?你说,当然,这是常识。当你违背了承诺,当你背弃了信实,当你做出了委身然后又放弃了那个委身,你不会对所有人说:"嘿,大家围过来。我想哭一场。"

不,你会走开。你是孤独的,因为承诺创造群体。没有委身就没有群体。我在南方一个小镇服事了十年,那里有两个人几乎整天在街上游荡。他们不完全是无家可归,但几乎是这样。

他们在那里出生长大,和这个镇上一半的人都有亲戚关系,但他们从不遵守承诺。他们一次又一次地违背承诺。结果,没有人信任他们,他们没有朋友。他们有很多亲戚。但他们没有任何人会和他们在一起,因为他们从来不为别人在场。

我不喜欢这样。他们甚至无法信任自己。违背承诺或甚至不做出承诺的必然后果,必然结果就是孤独,隔绝,被排斥在外。看,在纽约,对不起,我一直遇到这样的人,他们说:"当然,我不做承诺。别问我问题,我就不会对你撒谎。我保持我的选择开放。我不会做出委身。我不会让自己被困住。我要做那些能够最大化快乐和利益的事。

所以我只是想让你预先知道我是谁。我

不对人做出承诺。我不对人做出许诺。换句话说,当你在我身边的时候要小心。你看,当你有一个这样的城市时,你拥有的不是一个城市,而是一片丛林。

而这种情况正在加剧,不是吗?因为如果你说,我不会为他人而在。我不会做出承诺。做出承诺就是说,我缩小了我的选择。除非你缩小选择范围,否则你无法成为朋友。

不去做你今晚想做的事,你需要过去看看那个朋友,因为你知道那个朋友正在经历一些事情。我不想经历这个。我宁愿去做别的事,但他是我的朋友。她是我的朋友。没有友谊。

没有缩小你的选择范围,就没有社区。没有说,我有一个计划,我会坚持下去,无论发生什么。刘易斯·米德(Lewis Meads)是一个写了一篇关于许诺的精彩文章的人。他在文章中有这样一句名言。他说,自从婚礼那天起,我的妻子已经嫁给了五个不同的男人。而他们每一个都是我。

因为他是个老人了。他是在他们结婚超过五十年后写的。换句话说,他在谈论这些年来他自己改变了多少。他说,我的妻子嫁给了五个不同的男人。每一个都是我。

但是将这些男人连接成一个完整整体的纽带,是我在婚礼那天所做的承诺。那个承诺赋予我一个身份。而那个身份就是:我是那个会与你同在的人。如果我曾经舍弃那个名字,如果我曾经打破那个承诺,我将永远找不到我自己。而连接我们的纽带也会断裂。

在五十多年里,这位妻子如何能够与一个变化如此之大的男人保持关系,反之亦然呢?当然,他是从男性的角度来写的。他说,她能够知道的唯一方式就是因为我的承诺。如果我打破那个承诺,就没有社区了。她为什么还要再信任我?

我为什么还要信任我自己?如果我离开她去与另一个女人在一起,那个女人凭什么有信心我不会对她做同样的事?而我为什么应该

甚至认为我有任何信心不会再犯？我摊开手，那里什么都没有，而我孤身一人。总是，总是，总是，违背承诺的结果就是在外面痛哭流涕，环顾四周，没有人在那里，包括我自己。

无论我们看向何处，我们都看到破碎、战争、残酷和心痛。我们在周围的世界和我们自己的生活中都能感受到。这一切是怎么变成这样的？又能做些什么呢？在他本月发行的全新书籍《世界到底出了什么问题？》中，提姆·凯勒提供了一个清晰而富有同情心的答案。

凯勒博士从在救赎主教会的一系列教导中汲取内容，展示了罪的现实如何解释我们周围看到的痛苦，以及唯有福音如何提供持久的自由和医治。无论你是被我们这个世界的状况所压倒，还是在与自己的错误或选择作斗争，或是在寻找希望和喜乐，《世界到底出了什么问题？》都将帮助你看到福音如何既回应我们世界的心痛，也回应我们每个人内心的痛苦。这本新发行的书《世界到底出了什么问题？》是我们对你本月捐赠帮助"福音与生命"分享耶稣好消息的感谢。今天就在 gospelandlife.com/give 索取你的副本。

网址是 gospelandlife.com/give。这就是承诺如何塑造我们。没有做出承诺并坚守承诺的人，就没有社会。没有它就没有家庭。你知道家庭是什么吗？

家庭就是当两个人走到一起，他们敢于做出这样的承诺：我们要抚养小孩子直到他们长大到能够照顾自己。如果你敢于做出这个承诺，我们就会坚持到底，无论他们如何行事。我们会坚持到底，无论他们如何对待我们。如果你不敢做出这个承诺，你就没有家庭。

只有当你遵守这个承诺时，你才有家庭。没有社会。没有家庭。没有婚姻。没有社群。没有友谊——如果不愿意约束自己的心并说，我现在就与自己立约，从现在起五年后，我仍然会在那里支持你。现在的问题是，那么我们如何才能做出承诺呢？如果

承诺塑造了我们，但我们如何才能做出承诺呢？这就是你们很多人问这个问题的原因。我知道你们在说，我这里有问题。

我对你所说的确实有问题。你似乎把它说得很简单，但事实并非如此。一方面，当你做出承诺时，人们会利用你。我做过承诺，也被伤害过。人们利用过我。

我现在害怕做出承诺。据我所见，纽约到处都是被过去的承诺伤害过的人，他们说，下次我要更加小心，如果还有下次的话。另一方面，还有另一些人说，我遇到的另一个问题是，当我真的做出承诺时，我无法坚持。我无法坚持。我就像彼得一样，我会崩溃。

我无法贯彻到底。但这里有一个秘密。你必须看彼得的整个故事才能理解。在约翰福音第21章，耶稣来恢复彼得。在那段经文中，他就是这样做的。

我可以给你一个概要。他做了一件事。首先，他让彼得坐在火边。然后三次问他说，西门，约拿的儿子，你爱我吗？彼得说，是的，我爱。

然后他再次问他，你爱我吗？他说，是的，我爱。第三次，三次否认，三次提问。你爱我吗？他说，是的，我爱。

每次之后，耶稣说了什么？我要你成为我羊群的领袖。我要你像以前一样喂养和带领我的羊群。在你违背承诺之前，我仍然要你带领。我要让你成为一个好领袖。

但他对彼得说，顺便说一句，你应该知道，如果你现在遵守对我的这个承诺，你正在做的这个新承诺，你将会被杀。你知道，如果你第一次遵守了承诺，你可能已经被杀了。好吧，现在你又做出了承诺，你无论如何都会被杀。他说，他的说法是，你会在十字架上伸展双手。你也会被钉十字架。

彼得转向约翰，就是坐在他旁边的那位使徒，他说，那他呢，主？耶稣看着彼得说，如果我决定你会被杀，但他不会呢？这关你什么事

你知道我是谁吗？跟随我。

那么，彼得被告知的话，你可能会说，那里发生了什么？因为从那时起，彼得就成为了一个守约的人。从那时起，彼得信守他的诺言。从那时起，彼得成为了一位了不起的领袖。他成为了一个有身份认同和群体归属的人，因为他信守承诺，因为你敢于做出的承诺越大，你越能更好地遵守它，你就越有自我意识，你就会拥有越多不可思议的朋友。

你没看到吗？创建一个教会是一件令人畏惧的事情，但那些聚在一起说"我们要建立这个教会，尽管它会花费我们很多"的人们，那里就有一个群体。看到了吗，承诺越大，彼得继续前进，他体验到了群体中的身份认同。那么，为什么呢？

这怎么可能呢？答案就在这里。他看到耶稣是一个守约者。他没有看着自己，没有说"我能做到。你知道，意志力。"

我能做出承诺。我能做到。我知道我能。他没有从意志力中汲取力量，没有看着自己，而是看到耶稣是一个守约者。他看到耶稣做出的三个承诺。

我告诉你，除非你看到同样的三个承诺，否则你永远不会成为一个守约者。你将无法做到，你会因为害怕而不敢做出承诺，就像那些曾经受过伤害的人一样，你也会因为太软弱而无法遵守承诺。你会因为害怕而不敢做出承诺。你会因为太软弱而无法遵守它们。结果，你会发现更少的身份认同和更少的群体归属。

除非你看到耶稣做出的这三个承诺，彼得看到了它们，这永远地改变了他。他从自己身上移开目光，转向守约者耶稣。那三个承诺是什么呢？好吧，让我简单提一下。耶稣承诺要审判。

耶稣承诺要死去。耶稣承诺要饶恕。我们必须拥有它们全部。我只是要逐一列举它们。第一，他的审判承诺。

耶稣基督说，彼得，我掌权。你活着，你死去，你死去，你活着。你不明白吗？我掌权。我是全地的审判者。

即使你们中的一些人可能会因为遵守承诺而遭受可怕的苦难

应许，你知道，在这里，让我们来看看你作为基督徒应该做出的一个应许，就是永远说真话。有人，你知道，这里有一个人说真话，老板说，我不喜欢这样，但你有胆量。你被提升了。所以这里有另一个基督徒。这个基督徒说，好的，我知道我是基督徒。

我要说真话。我可能知道一件事。我说真话。老板说，我不喜欢这样。你被解雇了。

对吧？等一下，彼得说，你知道，为什么我遵守应许我会被杀，而约翰遵守应许他会活着？为什么会这样？耶稣说，难道你不明白吗？我是审判者。

最终，一切都会被纠正。没有人能逃脱惩罚。听着，朋友们，除非你有一种理解，对历史和未来有一种充满希望的看法，除非你明白有一位上帝，无论在短期内遵守承诺让你付出什么代价，最终，真理、公义、怜悯、正直和良善，这些你坚持的事情，这些你在做出承诺时作为生命基础的事情，当你向上帝做出承诺时，说，这些东西是终极的现实。在这个世界上，有时候这些事情意味着你会遭受打击，但我们知道这个世界不是唯一的世界。我们知道还有一个更大的世界。

我们知道这就是为什么彼得能够在彼得后书第三章中说，我们根据应许等候，因为我们知道他将要审判，那正义、真理、公义、怜悯、爱和良善，这些我们作为生命基础的事情，它们是终极的现实。它们将会胜利，因此我们这些坚持它们的人，我们也会胜利。如果你不明白这一点，遵守承诺有什么用呢？换个方式说。还记得那些婴儿潮一代吗？

你记得这个，还记得这个广告吗？有一个啤酒广告曾经说，人生只有一次。所以你必须尽可能抓住所有的享受。你记得吗？我甚至都不记得是哪个品牌了。我是说，也许它只在

费城电视台。我不知道。你一生只活一次。你必须抓住所有能抓住的精彩。这是对历史最绝望的看法。

这是绝望的。为什么？你在说唯一能得到的幸福就在此时此地，因为当生命结束时，你就死了。当然，当太阳毁灭时，一切都会死去，一切都会在火焰中化为乌有。如果你相信你的生命是一个意外，最终一切都会在太阳的死亡中燃烧殆尽，你就不可能指望去遵守承诺。

你为什么要遵守承诺呢？遵守承诺的本质就是延迟满足。如果这一生就是全部，你为什么要延迟你的满足呢？耶稣说，你难道不明白吗？你做出承诺，然后失去工作。

你做出承诺，然后得到晋升。但我已经被指控了。一切最终都会扯平。只是暂时的，有时遵守承诺会让你失望。我是按照承诺审判的法官。

这是第一个承诺。其次，也是最重要的，是他要死的承诺。他要死的承诺。你听到我说的了。如果你一周前在这里，当人们加入教会时，再次从头到尾读圣经。

神说，如果你对我忠诚，我就对你忠诚。如果你向我委身，我就向你委身，一次又一次。十字架上发生了以前从未发生过、以后也永远不会再发生的事。有人——耶稣基督——走向十字架，对抗所有黑暗的力量，对抗他自己所有的感受。他在面对走向十字架的可能性时退缩了。

你知道他为什么有人性吗？在客西马尼园，他说，不要照我的意思，只要照你的意思。你知道他是什么意思吗？尽管他是一个完美的人，他仍然是一个人。他的神性完全知道他应该去哪里，但他的人性却害怕得要死。

他害怕死亡。他知道他将要经历什么。他知道那将是怎样的折磨。他是如何让他的人性和神性保持一致的？通过一个承诺，他说，不要照我的意思，只要照你的意思。

我已经把自己绑定在这个计划上。我要

去做这件事。他是一个有诚信的人，因为他遵守了承诺。希伯来书10章说，当耶稣来到世界时，他说，看哪，经上记着我的事，我来是要遵行你的旨意。

我来是要献上自己作为祭物。他记得那个应许。这就是他如何走向十字架的，但在十字架上，他说，我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？等一下。这是怎么回事？

这怎么可能呢？神总是说，如果你违背承诺，你就会孤单。但如果你遵守承诺，你会发现周围有人。如果你对我违背承诺，你就与我分离。但如果你对我守约，如果你对我遵守承诺，那么我就会与你同在。

但现在看看发生了什么。这是世界历史上第一次，也是唯一的一次，神对耶稣基督说，如果你遵守我的承诺，如果你对我守这个约，我就会离弃你。而在十字架上，耶稣绝对地、完全地孤独了。你知道为什么吗？利未记16章告诉我们，在赎罪日，一年一次，以色列民会为他们整年违背承诺的事做些什么。

每年你都会违背对神的承诺。你说，我要爱邻舍如同爱自己。没有人做到。你说，我要爱你、顺服你。没有人做到。

所以每年一次，他们有赎罪日，你知道他们在赎罪日做什么吗？听着，一年一次，大祭司会牵来一只活山羊。这是利未记16章，把双手按在活山羊的头上，承认以色列人一切的罪孽和悖逆，一切违背圣约、违背承诺的事。然后他要把这些罪归在山羊头上，把山羊送到旷野去。山羊要担当他们一切的罪孽，到无人之地。

你知道为什么吗？山羊被当作违背承诺的人。违背承诺的人要出去。违背承诺的人在外面。违背承诺的人在旷野。

违背承诺的人完全孤独。而在十字架上，耶稣成了那只替罪羊。这就是为什么希伯来书13章的作者实际上说这不是一个

耶稣被钉十字架的地方。他在城门外受苦，为的是用他的宝血救赎我们。耶稣基督是如此守约，以至于他愿意，他是如此守约。

他愿意走向十字架。但现在有件事很奇怪。他是如此守约，以至于他甘愿被当作终极违约者来对待，好让你我能成为守约的人。他被赶出去。他说，我的神，我的神，你为什么离弃我。

我独自在黑暗中。在我和你彻底弃绝的烈火之间没有任何阻隔。它正倾泻进我存在的核心。为什么他被这样对待？他被当作违约者来对待。

你知道有多奇怪吗？这边是彼得在院子里烤火取暖。那边是耶稣在受折磨。为什么？耶稣是违约者。

彼得才是违约者。彼得被替代了。耶稣承受了本该属于彼得的咒诅，而你我就是彼得。你看到了吗？现在，去找你的朋友，除非你看到了，这就把我们带到了结尾，第三件你必须看到的事是，耶稣能够在那火堆旁来到彼得面前，他能够说，彼得，你爱我吗？

三次。彼得悔改了，因为他必须说三次"我爱你"，好弥补他的否认。然后耶稣说了什么？耶稣说，既然如此，你仍然可以做我的领袖。你仍然可以做领袖。

我要把你重新放回领导的位置。什么？怎么可能？你说，如果违约是如此糟糕，守约是如此重要，他怎么能这样做？因为耶稣现在说，彼得，难道你不知道你第一次做错了什么吗？

你以为你的身份真的与你的守约紧紧相连。而基督徒的身份来自耶稣的守约。如果你认为你能通过守约来拯救自己，你就会像彼得一样成为违约者。彼得觉得他可以通过做一个非常委身的人来拯救自己。所以他在恐惧和骄傲中拿起了这个。

因为他在恐惧和骄傲中拿起了它，当他看到自己的软弱时，他陷入了绝望。但基督徒，这里有个讽刺的地方，如果你明白你不是靠自己的承诺得救

而是靠耶稣的守约。当你拿起一个承诺时，你会打破它。你是个罪人，但当你打破它时，你将无法否认它。你悔改。

而一个悔改的违约者就是一个守约者。你不会绝望。你的身份不会崩溃，因为你会说，他宽恕了。他爱我，不是因为我一直是守约者，而是因为他是守约者。正因为如此，这里有一个巨大的讽刺，一个悖论。

当你违背承诺，而你知道自己是一个因恩典而得救的罪人时，你可以迅速悔改，这会让你马上回到之前的状态。你不找借口。你不否认，你又回到守约的状态中。那些最能向神守约的人，正是那些知道自己做不到的人。那些最能向神守约并成长的人，正是那些知道自己被爱，不是因为他们是守约者，而是因为耶稣是守约者的人。

你知道这让你处于什么位置吗？你们中的一些人害怕做出承诺。这就是你们在纽约的原因。这就是为什么你们中的一些人甚至不约会。这就是为什么你们中的一些人没有很多朋友。

这就是为什么你们中的一些人不把自己投入到别人的生活中。这就是为什么你们中的一些人从不加入教会。你害怕承诺。你不明白吗？他是审判者。

不要害怕。而且他死了。他承担了你的惩罚。他愿意守这样的承诺。为什么你不能为他守承诺呢？

另一方面，顺便说一句，你们中的一些人太急于做出承诺了。这同样糟糕。你知道为什么吗？现在你可以看到，如果你太急于做出承诺，而且你做了那么多承诺，你会发现它们相互矛盾。你向这个人承诺这个，向那个人承诺那个，向另一个人承诺另一个，然后你实际上无法兑现，你不得不退出，你不得不悔改。

你不明白吗？守约是如此重要，以至于你们中那些害怕做出承诺的人需要开始做出更多承诺。但守约是如此重要，以至于你们中一些过度承诺和过度投入的人需要开始收敛，因为守约是一件神圣的事。当你做出承诺时，你只是比神低一点点

承诺，你立约，你不应该太快这样做。这个房间里几乎每个人都会走向一个极端或另一个极端。

但最重要的是，如果你现在正在考虑做一些不顺服的事。你曾向上帝许诺。我不会说谎。我要对我的配偶忠诚。你知道，我要在婚前保持贞洁。

你知道，不管怎样，你基于上帝的律法做出承诺，而现在如果你害怕自己要退缩了。哦，天哪，看看他为你守住承诺付出了什么代价，而当他这样做时，他被击碎了。现在，你为他守住承诺会付出什么代价呢？完全不能相比。完全不能相比。

上帝对耶稣说，如果你为我守住承诺，我就会离弃你。但你知道他对你说什么吗？他说，如果你守住那个承诺，尽管会很难，如果你说出真相，如果你做正确的事，如果你守住那个承诺，我会与你同在。我会环绕你。我会降临在你身上。

这与他对耶稣说的话完全相反，但耶稣为你守住了他的承诺。难道你不能为他守住你的承诺吗？在耶稣基督里，上帝的一切应许都是确实的、阿们的。让我们像他一样。让我们祷告。

天父，我们祈求你现在赐给我们这个可能性。成为正直的人，成为既不太快也不太慢做出承诺的男人和女人，并且这样做是因为你的儿子这样做了。使我们成为言出必行的人，使我们成为诚实的人，让世界看到这个群体，为这里在爱中所说的真话、为所做出的承诺、为委身而惊叹。人们给出金钱的方式，人们给出时间的方式，人们给出真心的方式，这些人不害怕彼此委身。使我们成为这样的人，因为我们看到了你的儿子，那伟大的守约者，我们奉耶稣的名祷告。

阿们。
