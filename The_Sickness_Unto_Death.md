### Introduction: Life's Deepest Questions

When someone you know is contemplating life's deepest questions, who am I? What's wrong with the world? What can truly make me whole? Jesus doesn't just give us answers. He gives us Himself. In this month's podcast, Tim Keller looks at how we can share the hope we have in Christ as the answer to a person's search for meaning and purpose.

As you may know, August is Goen's share month at Gospel and Life, and we've curated a wide range of free resources to help you take simple steps to share the Gospel with someone God has put in your life. You can access these resources at gospelandlife.com/share. We believe God uses small acts to do great things, and we're inviting you to do simple, small acts to go and share the Gospel this month, because the Gospel changes everything.

Today's Scripture reading is from the book of Ecclesiastes, chapter 2 verses 9 through 26.

> I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me. In all this, my wisdom stayed with me. I denied myself nothing my eyes desired. I refused my heart, no pleasure. My heart took delight in all my labor, and this was the reward for all my toil. And when I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toil to achieve, everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind. Nothing was gained under the sun.

**The word of the Lord. Thanks be to God.**

### The Main Thought Experiment: Life Under the Sun

Did you know that Herman Melville in Moby Dick, chapter 96, said that Ecclesiastes is the truest book in the world? You knew that, of course, and you knew a chapter, right? Ecclesiastes, which you just heard read, is really at least one of the most confusing books in the world. Certainly, the first time through, because it depicts a very, very, very disillusioned man.

In fact, the very beginning of Ecclesiastes in the very first verses, this is what the author says, meaningless, meaningless, utterly meaningless, everything is meaningless. And then, of course, that was wonderfully inspiring words there in verse 17 that we read. And so I hated life, because everything that was done under the sun was grievous to me and meaningless.

Now, the reason it's confusing as you're looking at this and you're saying is the Bible really saying that all human life is pointless. And to understand what's going on here, you need to keep two things in mind. The first is that the author is a person who, in verse 1 of chapter 1, in the very beginning of the book of Ecclesiastes. Verse 1, chapter 1, the author is named, is called the Cohelleth. It's a Hebrew word that's actually pretty hard to translate, but many people would say, it means the professor.

### The Pleasure Project

In verses 1 to 11, it comes down to 1 to 11, he imagines that he is living with all the sensual pleasure you want, sensual pleasure by that, I mean the pleasure of the senses. And so in verses 1 to 11, even though they're not printed here in chapter 2, he talks about he has a harem, there's sex, he's got food, he's got houses, he's got servants, he has every sensual pleasure, every pleasure of the senses, and he summarizes it in verse 10 here at the top where he says, I denied myself nothing, my eyes desired. I refused my heart, no pleasure, so he lived for pleasure, okay?

**What happened? He tells you, verse 11, but when I surveyed everything, everything was meaningless, chasing after the wind, nothing was gained under the sun.**

### Living for Wisdom

He turns away from the pleasure, and he tries wisdom. I turn my thoughts to wisdom and madness and folly. What more can the King's successor do that has been done? I saw that wisdom is better than folly, as light is better than darkness, the wise of eyes in their head while the fools walk in darkness.

**Now what is he talking about? What does it mean to live for wisdom?**

### Living for Achievement

The cohella says, well, what if I was living for achievement? What if I was living for not pleasure and not wisdom and brilliance and insight, but achievement? Just hard work. Well, of course, the same thing happens, and you can see it in verse 17. So I hated life because all the work that is done, under the sun, if this life is all there is, under the sun, all the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. It's all meaningless to chasing after the wind.

### The Lesson: Meaninglessness Without God

The way to get an understanding of ecclesiastes is to look at the repetition, the repetitious, the repeated phrases. And so the phrase under the sun is a key to the first thought experiment. And the phrase meaningless, meaningless, this is meaningless, that's meaningless. It's the lesson. It's saying that if this life is all we can know. And if you base your meaning in life on just things that are here, you have no meaning, no lasting meaning, and no sustainably enduring satisfying life.

### The Small Thought Experiment: Life with God

Suddenly, see, if you're reading the book of Ecclesiastes, the word God is nowhere to be seen except just one little place in the beginning of chapter 1. So all through chapter 1 and 2, the word God isn't here. Why? Because it's a thought experiment. We're looking at life under the sun. In verse 24 to 26, God comes up. In fact, all the way into chapter 3, the word God is used ten times.

**Now suddenly, everything has changed. God is back in the picture.**

### The Gift of Meaninglessness

The last thing he gives, the last gift he gives is he gives people the gift of futility and meaninglessness. Now, you say, how in the world is that a gift? Isn't that a punishment? Isn't that a curse? It depends on what you do with it. Because in Romans 18, it says, God subjected this world to futility, meaninglessness in hope.

### Conclusion: Finding Meaning in Christ

In Jesus Christ died on the cross, he cried out, my God, my God, why has thou forsaken me? Do you know what he was experiencing when he said that? He was experiencing life without God. He was praying to God and God wasn't there. He looked to the heavens and the heavens were brass. He was stuck here. He was experiencing life without God. He was stuck under the sun. And he was experiencing spiritual nausea, profound nausea, spiritual futility, meaninglessness because God wasn't there for him.

**Why was he doing that? He was getting what we deserved.**

Let us pray. Our Father, we thank You for helping us to see that Jesus Christ took the meaninglessness of our lives. He took life without God so we could have life with you. And when we see Him doing that, that makes us want to please Him. Now Lord, as we protect the Lord's Supper, as we see in a sense, you pouring yourself out for us, Lord Jesus Christ, move us so that we can delight in you more deeply and have the life of meaning that sees everything as a gift. We thank You for this. We pray You to apply it to our hearts by the Holy Spirit and Jesus name we pray, amen.

### 引言：生命的深刻问题

当你认识的人在思考生命中最深刻的问题时，我是谁？世界出了什么问题？什么能真正使我完整？耶稣不仅给我们答案，他把自己给了我们。在本月的播客中，Tim Keller 探讨了我们如何分享我们在基督里的希望，作为一个人寻找意义和目的的答案。

今天的经文阅读来自传道书第二章第9到26节。

> 我比以前在耶路撒冷的任何人都更伟大。在这一切中，我的智慧与我同在。我没有拒绝我眼睛所欲的任何东西。我没有拒绝我心中的任何快乐。我的心在我所有的劳作中得到了快乐，这是我所有辛劳的回报。当我审视我手所做的一切和我所努力达到的目标时，一切都是虚空，捕风捉影。在日光之下没有任何收获。

**主的话语。感谢上帝。**

### 主要思想实验：日光之下的生活

你知道吗，赫尔曼·梅尔维尔在《白鲸》第96章中说，传道书是世界上最真实的书。你当然知道这一点，你还知道是哪一章，对吧？传道书，你刚刚听到的，是世界上至少最令人困惑的书之一。肯定是第一次阅读时，因为它描绘了一个非常非常非常失望的人。

事实上，传道书的开头在第一节，这就是作者所说的，虚空，虚空，完全虚空，一切都是虚空。然后，当然，我们在第17节读到的那些话是非常鼓舞人心的。所以我恨恶生命，因为在日光之下所做的一切对我来说都是痛苦和虚空。

现在，令人困惑的原因是你在看这段经文时会说，圣经真的在说所有人类的生命都是无意义的吗？要理解这里发生的事情，你需要记住两件事。首先是作者是一个人，在传道书的第一章第一节，在书的开头。第一章第一节，作者被称为传道者。这是一个希伯来词，实际上很难翻译，但许多人会说，它的意思是教授。

### 享乐计划

在第1到11节，他想象自己生活在你想要的所有感官享乐中，感官享乐，我指的是感官的快乐。因此，在第1到11节，尽管它们没有印在这里的第二章中，他谈到他有一个后宫，有性，有食物，有房子，有仆人，他拥有每一种感官享乐，每一种感官的快乐，他在这里的第10节总结道，我没有拒绝我眼睛所欲的任何东西。我没有拒绝我心中的任何快乐，所以他为享乐而活，好吗？

**发生了什么？他告诉你，第11节，但当我审视一切时，一切都是虚空，捕风捉影，在日光之下没有任何收获。**

### 为智慧而活

他从享乐中转向智慧。我转向智慧、疯狂和愚昧。国王的继承者还能做什么呢？我看到智慧比愚昧更好，正如光明比黑暗更好，智慧的人头脑清醒，而愚昧的人在黑暗中行走。

**他在说什么？为智慧而活是什么意思？**

### 为成就而活

传道者说，好吧，如果我为成就而活呢？如果我不是为享乐而活，也不是为智慧、才华和洞察力而活，而是为成就而活呢？只是努力工作。当然，同样的事情发生了，你可以在第17节看到。所以我恨恶生命，因为在日光之下所做的一切工作对我来说都是痛苦的。如果这生命是我们所拥有的一切，在日光之下所做的一切工作对我来说都是痛苦的。这一切都是虚空，捕风捉影。

### 教训：没有神的虚无

理解传道书的方式是看重复的短语。因此，短语“日光之下”是第一个思想实验的关键。短语“虚空，虚空，这个是虚空，那个是虚空。”是教训。它在说，如果这生命是我们所能知道的一切。如果你把生命的意义建立在仅仅是这里的事物上，你就没有意义，没有持久的意义，也没有可持续的满足生活。

### 小思想实验：与神同在的生活

突然间，看，如果你在读传道书，除了在第一章的一个小地方，神这个词无处可见。因此，在第一章和第二章中，神这个词不在这里。为什么？因为这是一个思想实验。我们在看日光之下的生活。在第24到26节，神出现了。事实上，一直到第三章，神这个词被使用了十次。

**现在突然间，一切都改变了。神回到了画面中。**

### 虚无的礼物

他给的最后一件礼物是他给人们虚无和无意义的礼物。现在，你说，这怎么可能是礼物？这不是惩罚吗？这不是诅咒吗？这取决于你如何处理它。因为在罗马书18章中，它说，神使这个世界服从虚无，以希望。

### 结论：在基督中找到意义

在耶稣基督死在十字架上时，他喊道，我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？你知道他在说这话时经历了什么吗？他在经历没有神的生活。他在向神祷告，而神不在那里。他仰望天空，天空是铜墙铁壁。他被困在这里。他在经历没有神的生活。他被困在日光之下。他在经历精神上的恶心，深刻的恶心，精神上的虚无，无意义，因为神不在那里。

**他为什么这样做？他在承受我们应得的。**

让我们祷告。我们的父，我们感谢你帮助我们看到耶稣基督承受了我们生命的无意义。他承受了没有神的生活，以便我们可以拥有与你同在的生活。当我们看到他这样做时，这让我们想要取悦他。现在主，当我们保护主的晚餐时，当我们在某种意义上看到你为我们倾倒自己时，主耶稣基督，感动我们，以便我们可以更深地喜悦于你，并拥有看到一切都是礼物的有意义的生活。我们为此感谢你。我们祈求你通过圣灵将其应用于我们的心中，奉耶稣的名祷告，阿门。
