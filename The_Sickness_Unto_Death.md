## English Transcript / 英文原文

Today's Scripture reading is from the book of Ecclesiastes, chapter 2 verses 9 through 26. I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me. In all this, my wisdom stayed with me. I denied myself nothing my eyes desired. I refused my heart, no pleasure.

My heart took delight in all my labor, and this was the reward for all my toil. And when I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toil to achieve, everything  was meaningless, a chasing after the wind. Nothing was gained under the sun. Then I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom, and also madness and folly. What more can the King's successor do than what has already been done?

I saw that wisdom is better than folly, just as light is better than darkness. The wise have eyes in their heads while the fool walks in the darkness, but I came to  realize that the same fate overtakes them both. Then I said to myself, the fate of the fool will overtake me also. What then do I gain by being wise? I said to myself, this too is meaningless.

For the wise, like the fool, will not be long remembered, the days have already come when  both have been forgotten. Like the fool, the wise too must die. So I hated life because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind. I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun because I must leave them to the one  who comes after me.

And who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish. Yet they will have control over all the fruit of my toil into which I have poured my effort  and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless. So my heart began to despair over all my toil some labor under the sun. For a person may labor with wisdom, knowledge, and skill, and then they must leave all they  own to another who is not toiled for it.

This too is meaningless and a great misfortune. What do people get for all the toil and anxious striving with which they labor under the sun? All their days they work is grief and pain, even at night their minds do not rest. This too is meaningless. A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own  toil.

This too, I see, is from the hand of God, for without him who can eat or find enjoyment. To the person who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and happiness, but to the  sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who  pleases God. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind. The word of the Lord. Thanks be to God.

Did you know that Herman Melville in Moby Dick, chapter 96, said that Ecclesiastes is  the truest book in the world. You knew that, of course, and you knew a chapter, right? Ecclesiastes, which you just heard read, is really at least one of the most confusing books  in the world. Certainly, the first time through, because it depicts a very, very, very disillusioned man. In fact, the very beginning of Ecclesiastes in the very first verses, this is what the author  says, meaningless, meaningless, utterly meaningless, everything is meaningless.

And then, of course, that was wonderfully inspiring words there in verse 17 that we read. And so I hated life, because everything that was done under the sun was grievous to me  and meaningless. Now, the reason it's confusing as you're looking at this and you're saying is the Bible  really saying that all human life is pointless. And to understand what's going on here, you need to keep two things in mind. The first is that the author is a person who, in verse 1 of chapter 1, in the very beginning  of the book of Ecclesiastes.

Verse 1, chapter 1, the author is named, is called the Cohelleth. It's a Hebrew word that's actually pretty hard to translate, but many people would say,  it means the professor. And those of you who've been a good graduate seminars know that a professor in a graduate  seminar doesn't preach and doesn't even lecture usually, but goes you with questions, tries  to get you to think it out for yourself. The other thing that's important to recognize is this little term, in fact, you can see it  in the beginning of chapter in the very beginning of the reading here. It says, I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me and all this my wisdom  stayed with me.

Over and over again, the author says, so I live for pleasure, but my wisdom stayed with  me. And then I achieved more things in Jerusalem than anyone before me and all this my wisdom  stayed with me, which sounds a little strange, but it's actually in a side and here's what  he's doing. It's an ancient way of saying, this is a thought experiment. I am imagining I'm in this situation, you know, if I ask you to do a thought experiment,  I'm usually saying, imagine this and imagine this and this is the condition, and I put  yourself in this situation, what would you think? That's what he's doing.

And every so often he says, my wisdom stayed with me, which is a way of saying, now look,  I'm looking at this and I'm trying to figure out what it teaches us. It's a little bit like an actor who comes up on stage and begins to act a role, and then  every so often comes over on the side and says to the, speaks to the audience is, now  here's what we can learn about this and here's what we can learn about this. And actually, that's the secret to understanding the book of Ecclesiastes. It's a set of thought experiments in which the professor is saying, so let's imagine living  like this and let's imagine living like this, and what do we see, and what does that mean? And does that work?

And all the time my wisdom stays with me is a way of saying, well, yeah, I mean obviously  I'm doing this as a thought experiment, I'm still myself. So I started to live for this, but I was looking at myself, got it? And therefore, if you want to understand what Ecclesiastes is after, we need to look  at these thought experiments and let me show you a long thought experiment and the main  lesson. And then in here, the passage we've read, there's a short thought experiment and an arrow. Okay, a main thought, there's a major thought experiment with a lesson and there's a small  thought experiment at the very end and then an arrow or a pointer.

With me, let's go. First of all, the main one, the big one. The big thought experiment is how to look at life under the sun. Do you see, there's 30 times in the book of Ecclesiastes, it uses the term under the sun. And you'll notice that what he says is not that life is meaningless.

He says life is meaningless under the sun. So it says in verse, you know, it says in verse 11, nothing was gained under the sun. Everything was meaningless under the sun and you see that's the verse 11, it's also  verse 17, 20, 22 and it actually happens 30 times in the book. Now, what does that mean? Commentators and scholars will say that when he says, I looked at life under the sun,  what he meant is I considered life here on earth without regard to eternity or God.

Let's make believe, for a moment, that this life is all there is. That's what he's doing. Now, this is what's called a secular mindset and you have to be careful here. To be a secular person doesn't mean to be an atheist. Certainly, Ecclesiastes, the author here wouldn't have known any atheists, they didn't  exist back then.

And even today, even though we live in a largely, basically a secular culture, there's  not that many, there's not a very large percentage of people who are actually atheists. But Charles Taylor, Canadian philosopher who wrote a book recently, a big book that everyone  thinks is important on secularism, on a secular age, he says, to be secular is not that  you don't believe in God or in afterlife. It's to say, but nobody can know if there's a God, nobody can know if there's an afterlife. And therefore, this world, by the way, the word secular comes from the Latin word secule  which means the present. Basically what a secular mindset is says, well, there may be a God, maybe not.

There may be an afterlife, maybe not. But all we can know is this world and this life, time and space. And therefore, a secular person says, well, there may be a God or not, but we have to find  our comfort here, we have to find our happiness here, we have to find our meaning right here  in this life. This is life under the sun. So basically, this major thought experiment, which is a big part of what the book of Ecclesiastes  is about, is essentially saying this, the author is saying, okay, deal.

I am going to look at life as if this life is all that we can know. And then I'm going to base my life only on things that can be had here and now. And then I'm going to ask on its own terms is such a life meaningful. On its own terms, is it satisfying? And that's what he does.

And he does this experiment looking at life under the sun in three ways. What does it mean to live as if this life is all there is? Well, one way to do it is what we can call here, the pleasure project. In verses 1 to 11, it comes down to 1 to 11, he imagines that he is living with all the  sensual pleasure you want, sensual pleasure by that, I mean the pleasure of the senses. And so in verses 1 to 11, even though they're not printed here in chapter 2, he talks about  he has a harem, there's sex, he's got food, he's got houses, he's got servants, he has  every sensual pleasure, every pleasure of the senses, and he summarizes it in verse 10  here at the top where he says, I denied myself nothing, my eyes desired.

I refused my heart, no pleasure, so he lived for pleasure, okay? What happened? He tells you, verse 11, but when I surveyed everything, everything was meaningless, chasing  after the wind, nothing was gained under the sun. By the way, that term, chasing after the wind is so perfect to talk about what it means  to live a life of pleasure. When you live for pleasure, it's like chasing after the wind, how so?

Well the wind is something you can feel, can't you? You certainly can feel the wind, but try to grab it, actually try to get ahead of it or  try to get a hold of it, you can't. And so pleasure is like that, actually. All pleasure is like that, when you live for pleasure, you find that yes, it feels good  and yet it fades even as you're grasping hold of it. Years ago, I think I'll actually read you this, years ago there was a woman who lived in  New York and she wrote for the village voice, her name was Cynthia Heimel, H-E-I-M-E-L.

And later she moved out to L-A and she wrote not for the village voice, but for Playboy. She was a very ascetic writer and she wrote a column in the village voice in 1989, the  year I moved here. And in it, she talked about, I guess she was very ascetic, but she was right on. She had known at that point a number of people who had been working as bouncers in nightclubs  and, you know, hat check girls and things like that and had become famous. She actually named two or three people that she knew that had become big movie stars.

She named them and she knew her, this big movie star when she worked behind the cosmetic  counter at Macy's. And she knew him, there was another big movie star when he, you know, worked at a movie  theater just, you know, punching tickets and things like that. And now they were famous. And here's what she said, in every case she either still knew them or she knew people  who knew them. In every case, they were more unhappy than they'd been before they were successful.

They were more angry. They were more anxious. And actually, you know, kind of cynically, she wrote this, this is from the clipping. She says that giant thing that they were striving for, that fame thing that was going to make  everything okay, that was going to make their lives bearable, that was going to fill them  with happiness had happened, and they were still them. And disillusionment turned them howling and insufferable.

And so that's exactly the same thing that the co-hell of the saying. He says, you know, when you live for pleasure, it just doesn't work. It just simply doesn't. It's like a chasing after the wind. On its own terms, pleasure, a living for pleasure isn't pleasurable, and everybody who  lives for it says so.

Okay, what else could you do in order to live for, is if this world is all there is. The other thing you could do is live for, you see, he turns, notice, and he says, in verse  12, then I turn my thoughts to consider wisdom. So he turns away from the pleasure, and he tries wisdom. I turn my thoughts to wisdom and madness and folly. What more can the King's successor do that has been done?

I saw that wisdom is better than folly, as light is better than darkness, the wise of  eyes in their head while the fools walk in darkness. Now what is he talking about? What does it mean to live for wisdom? Well, probably, since as part of this thought experiment of life under the sun, by wisdom  here, he's really thinking of philosophy. Philosophy, by definition, ever since the Greeks and ascents invented philosophy, philosophy  is trying to use human reason to figure out the meaning of life and how you should live,  without recourse to religion.

Not that there aren't religious philosophers, but by and large, the whole idea of philosophy  is you use reason, and with reason you are seeking the meaning of life and how human beings  should live without recourse to religion and God and things like that. The Greeks, of course, were the first and maybe the best, and they had all sorts of ways  of trying to figure out the meaning of life and what was behind the universe and what were  the moral assets behind the universe so that if we conformed to them, then we would be  living along the grain of the universe and we would be living full lives and wise lives. The philosopher's whole job was to say, what is the right way to live and what is the  wise way to live and what is the way of living that fits in with the reality of things and  the grain of things? So he said he got into that. He started to live for learning and scholarship and wisdom, but look, what happened?

Oh, this is amazing, I think. This is part of one of the great things about this book. He says, but I came to realize this is verse 14, that the same fate overtakes them both  who, the wise and the fool. The person who's working like crazy to be wise, the philosopher who's trying to think it  out. What is the meaning of life?

How should people live? What is right and wrong? What is the meaning of justice? How do we define justice? You're thinking and thinking and thinking and trying to make this world a better place and  what does it say?

And then I said to myself, the fate of the fool will overtake me also. What then do I gain by being wise? This too is meaningless. For the wise, like the fool, have both been forgotten. Like the fool, the wise will die.

Now this is extremely interesting. And in the history of philosophy, actually, if you get down to Jean Paul Sartre and Kirchegard  and Albeir Camus and people like that, this is really what they said. And that is, if this life is all there is and when you die, you rot. And when the sun goes out, the whole civilization dies and there's no one even around to remember  anything that you've ever done. You know what that means?

That means it doesn't matter how you live, it doesn't matter whether you're a nice person  or a nasty person. It doesn't matter whether you're a philanthropist or a serial killer, the product's the same. Think about this. If this life is all there is, then human civilization, what if human civilization lasted a million  years? I don't think it will, or two million years, or a billion years, okay.

Nevertheless, in comparison to the oceans of dead time that happened before, the universe  kind of came together and the earth came together and life began to grow up on the planet. And the oceans of dead time after the sun burns out and all civilization goes away. Even a human civilization lasts a billion years. In comparison to the oceans of dead time before and afterwards, that's like a flick, it's  just like a second, it's just like a blip. And everything that's ever been done, nobody will be around to remember it, everybody will  be forgotten.

And what that means is nothing you do matters, nothing you do makes any difference, nothing  you do has any significance, final at all, you say, well, but it does because it makes the  world a better place for how long? See if this life is all there is, everything you do is insignificant, all philosophy is  insignificant. There's no difference between living a wise or a good life or a foolish or a bad life. And that's not all. Finally, he applies, he thinks about, okay, what about work?

The cohella says, well, what if I was living for achievement? What if I was living for not pleasure and not wisdom and brilliance and insight, but  achievement? Just hard work. Well, of course, the same thing happens, and you can see it in verse 17. So I hated life because all the work that is done, under the sun, if this life is all  there is, under the sun, all the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me.

It's all meaningless to chasing after the wind. Why? Well, he gives two reasons and there's something. He says, first of all, he says, I hated all things I had toiled for under the sun because  I must leave him to one who comes after me and who knows whether that person will be  wise or foolish. Now, by the way, I want you to take that seriously.

In fact, let me push you on this. He's absolutely right. You know all the people. This is an absolute fact. There's no doubt about this.

All the people that worked very hard to establish Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. Who gave their money to establish Harvard, Yale, and Princeton 200 years ago and back for  that. You know that if they were suddenly brought back to life and saw what was taught at Harvard , Yale, and Princeton today, they would be absolutely appalled, right? They'd be totally appalled. They'd say, I want my money back.

And you say, well, everybody says, yes, of course, but you see, they were back then and  we're enlightened now. You see, of course, we couldn't teach what they taught. We're enlightened now. But you realize, don't you, that 100 years from now, you're great-grandchildren if you  have great-grandchildren are going to think you're just as enlightened, just as stupid,  the belief you got right now that you think are so progressive and so right on. And they're so different than those poor, benign, unenlightened people from 100 years ago.

You know that people are going to look at you that way in 100 years. And everything you do, even if you do anything worth keeping and anything that's last  and will be used by people who you consider fools. And therefore, nothing you do will accomplish anything. You're not going to accomplish anything at all. It's meaningless if this life is all there is.

And here's what you get for it, verse 23. All their days, their work is grief and pain even at night their minds are not rest. You spend all of your life anxious. All of your life restless. All of your life working like crazy.

And in the end, it goes nowhere. That's the end of the thought experiment. What is the lesson? Well the lesson is actually clear. The way to get an understanding of ecclesiastes is to look at the repetition, the repetitious,  the repeated phrases.

And so the phrase under the sun is a key to the first thought experiment. And the phrase meaningless, meaningless, this is meaningless, that's meaningless. It's the lesson. It's saying that if this life is all we can know. And if you base your meaning in life on just things that are here, you have no meaning,  no lasting meaning, and no sustainably enduring satisfying life.

Now, you know that the new atheists, people who in the last few years have been writing  very aggressive atheist books, say that that's wrong. They don't like what I just said. See here I'm saying, and what the co-hello professor is saying, is if there is no life beyond  the sun, if this world is all we have, and we only have to live for what's here, well,  there is no meaning in life, no solid meaning in life. And of course, they're saying that's not true. Stephen J.

Gould, who used to, who's passed away, but he used to teach at NYU and at Harvard,  one time he was asked, why are we here? What's our purpose? And he says, well, we're here because one group of fish had a particular fin anatomy that  could transform into legs for terrestrial creatures. And then he said, we may yearn for a higher answer, but none exists. In other words, we're here by accident.

There's nobody put us here. He says, this explanation, superficially troubling, maybe even terrifying, is ultimately  liberating. Why? Because we can't get meaning in life by looking at nature, we must construct these answers  for ourselves. And Richard Dawkins is the same thing.

He says, the truly adult view is our life is as meaningful and as wonderful as we choose  to make it. Now here's what they mean. They said, yes, of course, you can't, when Stephen J. Gould says, you can't read meaning  out of the facts of nature. What he means is, you can't say, why were we put here?

What is our purpose? What is our meaning? Why were we put here? We weren't put here. We just came.

We're here by accident. And when we die, darkness. But they say, you can decide what you want your meaning in life to be. You can decide I'm going to live to deal with hunger and Africa. You can decide I'm going to live for this cause or I'm going to live for to be a good  artist.

You decide what you want to live for and you can have a perfectly meaningful life. You decide what you want to live for. That doesn't work. Not only has the Cohella, the professor has shown how that doesn't work, it only works  if you don't think. But it doesn't work even if you don't think.

Victor Frankel, the Jewish psychologist that was put into the death camps during World  War II, but he survived. And he wrote a lot of books and much of what he says, I've always found fascinating and  applicable to a variety of things, but I'll tell you what I think they are now. Let me apply it to this. Frankel noted that during, when in the death camp, some prisoners lost everything. Some prisoners became bad.

They started to steal from other prisoners. They started to collaborate with the enemy. Other prisoners just became like zombies, they just became lost. Some of them literally curled up and died. In other words, they lost themselves.

But there were other prisoners that stayed strong, stayed courageous, stayed brave, stayed  caring for people. Now, here's the question, why? Why was it that some people went into the death camps and just basically just went away. They lost themselves and other people remained themselves. What was the difference?

And here's what Frankel said, it depended on what they made their meaning in life. Because if you make your meaning in life something the death camp can take away, then you  got no self-left. Now, what sort of things can death camp take away, anything under the sun? If you live for family, you may think you're pretty noble. I live for my family.

Death camp takes it away. The death, it's gone. They're maybe dead. You don't know where they are. They're taken away from you.

Maybe they're all dead. What if you live for some political cause? What if you live for status? What if you live for career? What if you live for making money?

What if you live for sex and romance? Whatever you live for, the death camp takes away from you. If it's something here, something under the sun, something got it. And you don't have a self-left. The only people that stayed strong, stayed themselves were people who live for something  that death camps couldn't take away, something that wasn't under the sun, something like  God, something like faith, something like, say, and therefore here's the lesson.

You actually can't create meaning for yourself. You have to discover meaning in something, some reality higher than yourself. Let me say that again. You actually can't do what Dawkins says. You can't create meaning for yourself.

You have to discover meaning by discovering some reality more important than you. And if you say, well, I decide I'm going to have meaning in life by living for that. No, I think I'll do that. No, I think I'll do that. You don't really have any higher thing that gives you meaning.

You're just living for yourself. You're just serving yourself. You're doing that because it makes you feel good about yourself. You're doing that because it's satisfying. You do that.

You're just living for yourself. You don't really have meaning. There's nothing that is more higher than you. There's no higher meaning. And you don't have a meaning that will last.

It's just death camps, but all sorts of things can take it away from you. You know that. And you won't have a self-left. But if you live for God, if you live for Him, if you base your meaning on something beyond  the sun, above the sun, nothing can take that away. You understand.

And therefore, you see, Sartre was right, not Dawkins. And the existential is right when they said this. If your origin is meaningless, we hear by accident, and your destiny is meaningless, you're  going to nothing. See, Dawkins says, okay, we're here by accident. Nobody put us here.

When we die, we rot. But meanwhile, we can have a meaningful life. You can decide what to live for. Sartre basically said, if your origin is  meaningless, and your destiny is meaningless, have the guts to admit, your life is meaningless. Everything in the middle is meaningless.

And see, Kierkegaard, sorry, Kierkegaard, wrote a book in 1849, a little book called The  Sickness unto Death. And you know what it is? It's the spiritual nausea of trying to build your meaning in life on things here and  always being afraid, always being restless, always afraid. It's like a chasing after the one you never can quite do it. You're always anxious.

You never can seem to quite grab. It's a spiritual nausea, a sense of meaninglessness, a sense of futility underneath everything. I think that's probably where Sartre got his idea for his great work, nausea. If your origin is meaningless, and your destiny is meaningless, have the guts to admit,  your life is meaningless. Now, that's the big experiment, and that's the lesson.

What's the small experiment? There's a little thought experiment, which fortunately for you, if you're looking at your  clock, is not going to take as long to get through as the first thought of the experiment. And it's only here in verse 24, 25, and 26. Suddenly, see, if you're reading the book of Ecclesiastes, the word God is nowhere to be  seen except just one little place in the beginning of chapter 1. So all through chapter 1 and 2, the word God isn't here.

Why? Because it's a thought experiment. We're looking at life under the sun. In verse 24 to 26, God comes up. In fact, all the way into chapter 3, the word God is used ten times.

And he says, a person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction  in their own toil. This too, I see from the hand of God. For without him who can eat or find enjoyment to the person who pleases God, him, God gives  wisdom, knowledge, and happiness. Now suddenly, everything has changed. God is back in the picture.

And so we have a new thought experiment. Now let's look at life with God in the center. And suddenly, all the things that before were chasing after the wind, were never quite  in our grasp, were always burdens or emptiness. Suddenly, these things are gifts. Because see, if you look in 24, work now as a gift, satisfaction in our own toil.

God's hand gives us satisfaction in our work. That's verse 24. And God gives us pleasure in even our daily food. Verse 25. You don't need herms and feasts.

If God's in the picture, even your daily food is a gift, you can get satisfaction in your  toil. And it says to the person who pleases him, God gives wisdom. So all the things that before were burdens, wisdom, work, pleasure are now gifts. Why? Well, you say, I guess it's just saying that you have to base your life on God.

Yes, but how? What if you make it your meaning in life will change things such that now the things that  were burdens suddenly become gifts? One is what will give you meaning in life, that will last, they'll give you solid satisfaction  and a solid identity. What is it? It's not just obeying God, it's pleasing him.

Twice it says to the one who pleases God. Now, I want you to think about that for a second. What does it mean to live for somebody's pleasure? See, there's many people who say, oh, I've lived for God, and when I say, what do you mean? Well, I went to church and I obeyed the thing, Commandments, and I read my Bible every day.

Well, are you, but I'm not doing that anymore. I'm not religious anymore. Why not? Well, I prayed, and God never gave me anything that I asked for. I tried very hard.

I lived a good life, and yet he wasn't coming for it. You know, I didn't have good health. I didn't get into the school I wanted to get into. This and that bad happened. So you know what?

It's possible to obey God, not for God's sake, but for your sake. You're praying, you think you're very religious, but you're obeying God to get the things  here in this world, under the sun, and they're the real reason you're living. And then you have a meaning in life that is actually just as unstable. You've got an identity that's just as unstable as the so-called secular person. You may think of yourself very religious, but if you're living for God, you think,  in order to get things, to get blessings, to get health, to get success, you're just  as unstable as everybody else is, and you'll have that spiritual nausea, too.

Well, then what should you be? You should be someone who serves God, yes, and obeys God, yes, just to give him pleasure. Let me tell you what real love is. It's not just emotional. It's not just saying, I want a relationship with you because I desire you, and I'm attracted  to you, and being with you makes me happy.

That's part of it, but that's certainly not the heart of it. And also love is not mainly volitional. It's not just, well, I have to do my duty, and I have to serve you. Let me tell you what real love is. You know you love somebody when you put your happiness into their happiness, so that  your greatest happiness is just to see them happy.

You've inserted your happiness in their happiness, so that you don't make them happy to feel  good about yourself, and you don't just seek them just because it makes you... You put your happiness into their happiness, so when they're happy, you're happy. Their joy is your joy. Their delight is your delight. There's nothing beyond it.

Then you know you love somebody, then you know you love somebody. And the only way to get a meaningful life is not just to obey God in some dutiful way,  in which case you're still essentially building your life on things here, the death cams  can take away from you, and a lot of other things can do. You need to obey God because you just wanted to light him, because you adore him that much,  because you love him that much. Well, how does that happen, you say, arrow? This little thought experiment kind of ends, but there's a pointer in it to something  else.

There's commentators point out, point out, that God in these four verses, these three  verses are constantly giving gifts. God gives the gift of satisfaction, God gives the gift of finding enjoyment, God gives  the gift of wisdom and knowledge, and then guess what? He gives one more gift, you know, do you see what it is? He gives the center of the gift of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the  one who pleases God, this too is meaningless and chasing after the wind. The last thing he gives, the last gift he gives is he gives people the gift of futility and  meaninglessness.

Now, you say, how in the world is that a gift? Isn't that a punishment? Isn't that a curse? It depends on what you do with it. Because in Romans 18, it says, God subjected this world to futility, meaninglessness in hope.

If God gives you, right now, if God is giving you an enhanced feeling of meaninglessness  and futility in life, and this is New York, so I bet you that's true quite a number of  you. It could be a gift if you let it drive you to where you should go. It could be a gift if it points you, if it gets you somewhere, you say, well, where? What? Here's what you should be looking at.

In Jesus Christ died on the cross, he cried out, my God, my God, why has thou forsaken  me? Do you know what he was experiencing when he said that? He was experiencing life without God. He was praying to God and God wasn't there. He looked to the heavens and the heavens were brass.

He was stuck here. He was experiencing life without God. He was stuck under the sun. And he was experiencing spiritual nausea, profound nausea, spiritual futility, meaninglessness  because God wasn't there for him. Why was he doing that?

He was getting what we deserved. We've tried to get away from God and we deserve life without God. And the nausea and the meaninglessness, but Jesus Christ came, went to the cross to take  the punishment we deserve so that God can forgive us. And he can love us and we can connect to him. So Jesus Christ got life without God on the cross so that we can have life with God  or put it this way.

On the cross, Jesus was putting himself in our lives. He was inserting himself. He was putting himself in our misery. He was putting himself in our mortality. He was going to the depths for us.

That's love. He couldn't be happy unless we were happy. And so he put himself in our misery. And when you see him doing that, that will get you to want to just delight in him. When you see him sacrificing for you, when you see him putting his love into you, his  happiness into your happiness, that makes you want to put your happiness into his.

It makes you delight in him. And that is what you need. You can't just say, well, I need it the light and God. I need to be a God, please. I need to be someone who loves God and obeys God just in order to please Him.

You've got to see Him do this to attract you so that His pleasure is your pleasure,  that there's nothing that delights you more than the delight the one who did this for you. And then if you can do that, to the degree you can do that, you'll have a meaning in  life that is bomb proof, that is death can't prove. And everything in life will become a gift. Wow. That's quite a lesson, Professor.

Let us pray. Our Father, we thank You for helping us to see that Jesus Christ took the meaninglessness  of our lives. He took life without God so we could have life with you. And when we see Him doing that, that makes us want to please Him. Now Lord, as we protect the Lord's Supper, as we see in a sense, you pouring yourself out  for us, Lord Jesus Christ, move us so that we can delight in you more deeply and have  the life of meaning that sees everything as a gift.

We thank You for this. We pray You to apply it to our hearts by the Holy Spirit and Jesus name we pray, amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

Today's Scripture reading is from the book of Ecclesiastes, chapter 2 verses 9 through 26. I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me. In all this, my wisdom stayed with me. I denied myself nothing my eyes desired. I refused my heart, no pleasure.

My heart took delight in all my labor, and this was the reward for all my toil. And when I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toil to achieve, everything  was meaningless, a chasing after the wind. Nothing was gained under the sun. Then I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom, and also madness and folly. What more can the King's successor do than what has already been done?

I saw that wisdom is better than folly, just as light is better than darkness. The wise have eyes in their heads while the fool walks in the darkness, but I came to  realize that the same fate overtakes them both. Then I said to myself, the fate of the fool will overtake me also. What then do I gain by being wise? I said to myself, this too is meaningless.

For the wise, like the fool, will not be long remembered, the days have already come when  both have been forgotten. Like the fool, the wise too must die. So I hated life because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind. I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun because I must leave them to the one  who comes after me.

And who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish. Yet they will have control over all the fruit of my toil into which I have poured my effort  and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless. So my heart began to despair over all my toil some labor under the sun. For a person may labor with wisdom, knowledge, and skill, and then they must leave all they  own to another who is not toiled for it.

This too is meaningless and a great misfortune. What do people get for all the toil and anxious striving with which they labor under the sun? All their days they work is grief and pain, even at night their minds do not rest. This too is meaningless. A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own  toil.

This too, I see, is from the hand of God, for without him who can eat or find enjoyment. To the person who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and happiness, but to the  sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who  pleases God. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind. The word of the Lord. Thanks be to God.

Did you know that Herman Melville in Moby Dick, chapter 96, said that Ecclesiastes is  the truest book in the world. You knew that, of course, and you knew a chapter, right? Ecclesiastes, which you just heard read, is really at least one of the most confusing books  in the world. Certainly, the first time through, because it depicts a very, very, very disillusioned man. In fact, the very beginning of Ecclesiastes in the very first verses, this is what the author  says, meaningless, meaningless, utterly meaningless, everything is meaningless.

And then, of course, that was wonderfully inspiring words there in verse 17 that we read. And so I hated life, because everything that was done under the sun was grievous to me  and meaningless. Now, the reason it's confusing as you're looking at this and you're saying is the Bible  really saying that all human life is pointless. And to understand what's going on here, you need to keep two things in mind. The first is that the author is a person who, in verse 1 of chapter 1, in the very beginning  of the book of Ecclesiastes.

Verse 1, chapter 1, the author is named, is called the Cohelleth. It's a Hebrew word that's actually pretty hard to translate, but many people would say,  it means the professor. And those of you who've been a good graduate seminars know that a professor in a graduate  seminar doesn't preach and doesn't even lecture usually, but goes you with questions, tries  to get you to think it out for yourself. The other thing that's important to recognize is this little term, in fact, you can see it  in the beginning of chapter in the very beginning of the reading here. It says, I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me and all this my wisdom  stayed with me.

Over and over again, the author says, so I live for pleasure, but my wisdom stayed with  me. And then I achieved more things in Jerusalem than anyone before me and all this my wisdom  stayed with me, which sounds a little strange, but it's actually in a side and here's what  he's doing. It's an ancient way of saying, this is a thought experiment. I am imagining I'm in this situation, you know, if I ask you to do a thought experiment,  I'm usually saying, imagine this and imagine this and this is the condition, and I put  yourself in this situation, what would you think? That's what he's doing.

And every so often he says, my wisdom stayed with me, which is a way of saying, now look,  I'm looking at this and I'm trying to figure out what it teaches us. It's a little bit like an actor who comes up on stage and begins to act a role, and then  every so often comes over on the side and says to the, speaks to the audience is, now  here's what we can learn about this and here's what we can learn about this. And actually, that's the secret to understanding the book of Ecclesiastes. It's a set of thought experiments in which the professor is saying, so let's imagine living  like this and let's imagine living like this, and what do we see, and what does that mean? And does that work?

And all the time my wisdom stays with me is a way of saying, well, yeah, I mean obviously  I'm doing this as a thought experiment, I'm still myself. So I started to live for this, but I was looking at myself, got it? And therefore, if you want to understand what Ecclesiastes is after, we need to look  at these thought experiments and let me show you a long thought experiment and the main  lesson. And then in here, the passage we've read, there's a short thought experiment and an arrow. Okay, a main thought, there's a major thought experiment with a lesson and there's a small  thought experiment at the very end and then an arrow or a pointer.

With me, let's go. First of all, the main one, the big one. The big thought experiment is how to look at life under the sun. Do you see, there's 30 times in the book of Ecclesiastes, it uses the term under the sun. And you'll notice that what he says is not that life is meaningless.

He says life is meaningless under the sun. So it says in verse, you know, it says in verse 11, nothing was gained under the sun. Everything was meaningless under the sun and you see that's the verse 11, it's also  verse 17, 20, 22 and it actually happens 30 times in the book. Now, what does that mean? Commentators and scholars will say that when he says, I looked at life under the sun,  what he meant is I considered life here on earth without regard to eternity or God.

Let's make believe, for a moment, that this life is all there is. That's what he's doing. Now, this is what's called a secular mindset and you have to be careful here. To be a secular person doesn't mean to be an atheist. Certainly, Ecclesiastes, the author here wouldn't have known any atheists, they didn't  exist back then.

And even today, even though we live in a largely, basically a secular culture, there's  not that many, there's not a very large percentage of people who are actually atheists. But Charles Taylor, Canadian philosopher who wrote a book recently, a big book that everyone  thinks is important on secularism, on a secular age, he says, to be secular is not that  you don't believe in God or in afterlife. It's to say, but nobody can know if there's a God, nobody can know if there's an afterlife. And therefore, this world, by the way, the word secular comes from the Latin word secule  which means the present. Basically what a secular mindset is says, well, there may be a God, maybe not.

There may be an afterlife, maybe not. But all we can know is this world and this life, time and space. And therefore, a secular person says, well, there may be a God or not, but we have to find  our comfort here, we have to find our happiness here, we have to find our meaning right here  in this life. This is life under the sun. So basically, this major thought experiment, which is a big part of what the book of Ecclesiastes  is about, is essentially saying this, the author is saying, okay, deal.

I am going to look at life as if this life is all that we can know. And then I'm going to base my life only on things that can be had here and now. And then I'm going to ask on its own terms is such a life meaningful. On its own terms, is it satisfying? And that's what he does.

And he does this experiment looking at life under the sun in three ways. What does it mean to live as if this life is all there is? Well, one way to do it is what we can call here, the pleasure project. In verses 1 to 11, it comes down to 1 to 11, he imagines that he is living with all the  sensual pleasure you want, sensual pleasure by that, I mean the pleasure of the senses. And so in verses 1 to 11, even though they're not printed here in chapter 2, he talks about  he has a harem, there's sex, he's got food, he's got houses, he's got servants, he has  every sensual pleasure, every pleasure of the senses, and he summarizes it in verse 10  here at the top where he says, I denied myself nothing, my eyes desired.

I refused my heart, no pleasure, so he lived for pleasure, okay? What happened? He tells you, verse 11, but when I surveyed everything, everything was meaningless, chasing  after the wind, nothing was gained under the sun. By the way, that term, chasing after the wind is so perfect to talk about what it means  to live a life of pleasure. When you live for pleasure, it's like chasing after the wind, how so?

Well the wind is something you can feel, can't you? You certainly can feel the wind, but try to grab it, actually try to get ahead of it or  try to get a hold of it, you can't. And so pleasure is like that, actually. All pleasure is like that, when you live for pleasure, you find that yes, it feels good  and yet it fades even as you're grasping hold of it. Years ago, I think I'll actually read you this, years ago there was a woman who lived in  New York and she wrote for the village voice, her name was Cynthia Heimel, H-E-I-M-E-L.

And later she moved out to L-A and she wrote not for the village voice, but for Playboy. She was a very ascetic writer and she wrote a column in the village voice in 1989, the  year I moved here. And in it, she talked about, I guess she was very ascetic, but she was right on. She had known at that point a number of people who had been working as bouncers in nightclubs  and, you know, hat check girls and things like that and had become famous. She actually named two or three people that she knew that had become big movie stars.

She named them and she knew her, this big movie star when she worked behind the cosmetic  counter at Macy's. And she knew him, there was another big movie star when he, you know, worked at a movie  theater just, you know, punching tickets and things like that. And now they were famous. And here's what she said, in every case she either still knew them or she knew people  who knew them. In every case, they were more unhappy than they'd been before they were successful.

They were more angry. They were more anxious. And actually, you know, kind of cynically, she wrote this, this is from the clipping. She says that giant thing that they were striving for, that fame thing that was going to make  everything okay, that was going to make their lives bearable, that was going to fill them  with happiness had happened, and they were still them. And disillusionment turned them howling and insufferable.

And so that's exactly the same thing that the co-hell of the saying. He says, you know, when you live for pleasure, it just doesn't work. It just simply doesn't. It's like a chasing after the wind. On its own terms, pleasure, a living for pleasure isn't pleasurable, and everybody who  lives for it says so.

Okay, what else could you do in order to live for, is if this world is all there is. The other thing you could do is live for, you see, he turns, notice, and he says, in verse  12, then I turn my thoughts to consider wisdom. So he turns away from the pleasure, and he tries wisdom. I turn my thoughts to wisdom and madness and folly. What more can the King's successor do that has been done?

I saw that wisdom is better than folly, as light is better than darkness, the wise of  eyes in their head while the fools walk in darkness. Now what is he talking about? What does it mean to live for wisdom? Well, probably, since as part of this thought experiment of life under the sun, by wisdom  here, he's really thinking of philosophy. Philosophy, by definition, ever since the Greeks and ascents invented philosophy, philosophy  is trying to use human reason to figure out the meaning of life and how you should live,  without recourse to religion.

Not that there aren't religious philosophers, but by and large, the whole idea of philosophy  is you use reason, and with reason you are seeking the meaning of life and how human beings  should live without recourse to religion and God and things like that. The Greeks, of course, were the first and maybe the best, and they had all sorts of ways  of trying to figure out the meaning of life and what was behind the universe and what were  the moral assets behind the universe so that if we conformed to them, then we would be  living along the grain of the universe and we would be living full lives and wise lives. The philosopher's whole job was to say, what is the right way to live and what is the  wise way to live and what is the way of living that fits in with the reality of things and  the grain of things? So he said he got into that. He started to live for learning and scholarship and wisdom, but look, what happened?

Oh, this is amazing, I think. This is part of one of the great things about this book. He says, but I came to realize this is verse 14, that the same fate overtakes them both  who, the wise and the fool. The person who's working like crazy to be wise, the philosopher who's trying to think it  out. What is the meaning of life?

How should people live? What is right and wrong? What is the meaning of justice? How do we define justice? You're thinking and thinking and thinking and trying to make this world a better place and  what does it say?

And then I said to myself, the fate of the fool will overtake me also. What then do I gain by being wise? This too is meaningless. For the wise, like the fool, have both been forgotten. Like the fool, the wise will die.

Now this is extremely interesting. And in the history of philosophy, actually, if you get down to Jean Paul Sartre and Kirchegard  and Albeir Camus and people like that, this is really what they said. And that is, if this life is all there is and when you die, you rot. And when the sun goes out, the whole civilization dies and there's no one even around to remember  anything that you've ever done. You know what that means?

That means it doesn't matter how you live, it doesn't matter whether you're a nice person  or a nasty person. It doesn't matter whether you're a philanthropist or a serial killer, the product's the same. Think about this. If this life is all there is, then human civilization, what if human civilization lasted a million  years? I don't think it will, or two million years, or a billion years, okay.

Nevertheless, in comparison to the oceans of dead time that happened before, the universe  kind of came together and the earth came together and life began to grow up on the planet. And the oceans of dead time after the sun burns out and all civilization goes away. Even a human civilization lasts a billion years. In comparison to the oceans of dead time before and afterwards, that's like a flick, it's  just like a second, it's just like a blip. And everything that's ever been done, nobody will be around to remember it, everybody will  be forgotten.

And what that means is nothing you do matters, nothing you do makes any difference, nothing  you do has any significance, final at all, you say, well, but it does because it makes the  world a better place for how long? See if this life is all there is, everything you do is insignificant, all philosophy is  insignificant. There's no difference between living a wise or a good life or a foolish or a bad life. And that's not all. Finally, he applies, he thinks about, okay, what about work?

The cohella says, well, what if I was living for achievement? What if I was living for not pleasure and not wisdom and brilliance and insight, but  achievement? Just hard work. Well, of course, the same thing happens, and you can see it in verse 17. So I hated life because all the work that is done, under the sun, if this life is all  there is, under the sun, all the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me.

It's all meaningless to chasing after the wind. Why? Well, he gives two reasons and there's something. He says, first of all, he says, I hated all things I had toiled for under the sun because  I must leave him to one who comes after me and who knows whether that person will be  wise or foolish. Now, by the way, I want you to take that seriously.

In fact, let me push you on this. He's absolutely right. You know all the people. This is an absolute fact. There's no doubt about this.

All the people that worked very hard to establish Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. Who gave their money to establish Harvard, Yale, and Princeton 200 years ago and back for  that. You know that if they were suddenly brought back to life and saw what was taught at Harvard , Yale, and Princeton today, they would be absolutely appalled, right? They'd be totally appalled. They'd say, I want my money back.

And you say, well, everybody says, yes, of course, but you see, they were back then and  we're enlightened now. You see, of course, we couldn't teach what they taught. We're enlightened now. But you realize, don't you, that 100 years from now, you're great-grandchildren if you  have great-grandchildren are going to think you're just as enlightened, just as stupid,  the belief you got right now that you think are so progressive and so right on. And they're so different than those poor, benign, unenlightened people from 100 years ago.

You know that people are going to look at you that way in 100 years. And everything you do, even if you do anything worth keeping and anything that's last  and will be used by people who you consider fools. And therefore, nothing you do will accomplish anything. You're not going to accomplish anything at all. It's meaningless if this life is all there is.

And here's what you get for it, verse 23. All their days, their work is grief and pain even at night their minds are not rest. You spend all of your life anxious. All of your life restless. All of your life working like crazy.

And in the end, it goes nowhere. That's the end of the thought experiment. What is the lesson? Well the lesson is actually clear. The way to get an understanding of ecclesiastes is to look at the repetition, the repetitious,  the repeated phrases.

And so the phrase under the sun is a key to the first thought experiment. And the phrase meaningless, meaningless, this is meaningless, that's meaningless. It's the lesson. It's saying that if this life is all we can know. And if you base your meaning in life on just things that are here, you have no meaning,  no lasting meaning, and no sustainably enduring satisfying life.

Now, you know that the new atheists, people who in the last few years have been writing  very aggressive atheist books, say that that's wrong. They don't like what I just said. See here I'm saying, and what the co-hello professor is saying, is if there is no life beyond  the sun, if this world is all we have, and we only have to live for what's here, well,  there is no meaning in life, no solid meaning in life. And of course, they're saying that's not true. Stephen J.

Gould, who used to, who's passed away, but he used to teach at NYU and at Harvard,  one time he was asked, why are we here? What's our purpose? And he says, well, we're here because one group of fish had a particular fin anatomy that  could transform into legs for terrestrial creatures. And then he said, we may yearn for a higher answer, but none exists. In other words, we're here by accident.

There's nobody put us here. He says, this explanation, superficially troubling, maybe even terrifying, is ultimately  liberating. Why? Because we can't get meaning in life by looking at nature, we must construct these answers  for ourselves. And Richard Dawkins is the same thing.

He says, the truly adult view is our life is as meaningful and as wonderful as we choose  to make it. Now here's what they mean. They said, yes, of course, you can't, when Stephen J. Gould says, you can't read meaning  out of the facts of nature. What he means is, you can't say, why were we put here?

What is our purpose? What is our meaning? Why were we put here? We weren't put here. We just came.

We're here by accident. And when we die, darkness. But they say, you can decide what you want your meaning in life to be. You can decide I'm going to live to deal with hunger and Africa. You can decide I'm going to live for this cause or I'm going to live for to be a good  artist.

You decide what you want to live for and you can have a perfectly meaningful life. You decide what you want to live for. That doesn't work. Not only has the Cohella, the professor has shown how that doesn't work, it only works  if you don't think. But it doesn't work even if you don't think.

Victor Frankel, the Jewish psychologist that was put into the death camps during World  War II, but he survived. And he wrote a lot of books and much of what he says, I've always found fascinating and  applicable to a variety of things, but I'll tell you what I think they are now. Let me apply it to this. Frankel noted that during, when in the death camp, some prisoners lost everything. Some prisoners became bad.

They started to steal from other prisoners. They started to collaborate with the enemy. Other prisoners just became like zombies, they just became lost. Some of them literally curled up and died. In other words, they lost themselves.

But there were other prisoners that stayed strong, stayed courageous, stayed brave, stayed  caring for people. Now, here's the question, why? Why was it that some people went into the death camps and just basically just went away. They lost themselves and other people remained themselves. What was the difference?

And here's what Frankel said, it depended on what they made their meaning in life. Because if you make your meaning in life something the death camp can take away, then you  got no self-left. Now, what sort of things can death camp take away, anything under the sun? If you live for family, you may think you're pretty noble. I live for my family.

Death camp takes it away. The death, it's gone. They're maybe dead. You don't know where they are. They're taken away from you.

Maybe they're all dead. What if you live for some political cause? What if you live for status? What if you live for career? What if you live for making money?

What if you live for sex and romance? Whatever you live for, the death camp takes away from you. If it's something here, something under the sun, something got it. And you don't have a self-left. The only people that stayed strong, stayed themselves were people who live for something  that death camps couldn't take away, something that wasn't under the sun, something like  God, something like faith, something like, say, and therefore here's the lesson.

You actually can't create meaning for yourself. You have to discover meaning in something, some reality higher than yourself. Let me say that again. You actually can't do what Dawkins says. You can't create meaning for yourself.

You have to discover meaning by discovering some reality more important than you. And if you say, well, I decide I'm going to have meaning in life by living for that. No, I think I'll do that. No, I think I'll do that. You don't really have any higher thing that gives you meaning.

You're just living for yourself. You're just serving yourself. You're doing that because it makes you feel good about yourself. You're doing that because it's satisfying. You do that.

You're just living for yourself. You don't really have meaning. There's nothing that is more higher than you. There's no higher meaning. And you don't have a meaning that will last.

It's just death camps, but all sorts of things can take it away from you. You know that. And you won't have a self-left. But if you live for God, if you live for Him, if you base your meaning on something beyond  the sun, above the sun, nothing can take that away. You understand.

And therefore, you see, Sartre was right, not Dawkins. And the existential is right when they said this. If your origin is meaningless, we hear by accident, and your destiny is meaningless, you're  going to nothing. See, Dawkins says, okay, we're here by accident. Nobody put us here.

When we die, we rot. But meanwhile, we can have a meaningful life. You can decide what to live for. Sartre basically said, if your origin is  meaningless, and your destiny is meaningless, have the guts to admit, your life is meaningless. Everything in the middle is meaningless.

And see, Kierkegaard, sorry, Kierkegaard, wrote a book in 1849, a little book called The  Sickness unto Death. And you know what it is? It's the spiritual nausea of trying to build your meaning in life on things here and  always being afraid, always being restless, always afraid. It's like a chasing after the one you never can quite do it. You're always anxious.

You never can seem to quite grab. It's a spiritual nausea, a sense of meaninglessness, a sense of futility underneath everything. I think that's probably where Sartre got his idea for his great work, nausea. If your origin is meaningless, and your destiny is meaningless, have the guts to admit,  your life is meaningless. Now, that's the big experiment, and that's the lesson.

What's the small experiment? There's a little thought experiment, which fortunately for you, if you're looking at your  clock, is not going to take as long to get through as the first thought of the experiment. And it's only here in verse 24, 25, and 26. Suddenly, see, if you're reading the book of Ecclesiastes, the word God is nowhere to be  seen except just one little place in the beginning of chapter 1. So all through chapter 1 and 2, the word God isn't here.

Why? Because it's a thought experiment. We're looking at life under the sun. In verse 24 to 26, God comes up. In fact, all the way into chapter 3, the word God is used ten times.

And he says, a person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction  in their own toil. This too, I see from the hand of God. For without him who can eat or find enjoyment to the person who pleases God, him, God gives  wisdom, knowledge, and happiness. Now suddenly, everything has changed. God is back in the picture.

And so we have a new thought experiment. Now let's look at life with God in the center. And suddenly, all the things that before were chasing after the wind, were never quite  in our grasp, were always burdens or emptiness. Suddenly, these things are gifts. Because see, if you look in 24, work now as a gift, satisfaction in our own toil.

God's hand gives us satisfaction in our work. That's verse 24. And God gives us pleasure in even our daily food. Verse 25. You don't need herms and feasts.

If God's in the picture, even your daily food is a gift, you can get satisfaction in your  toil. And it says to the person who pleases him, God gives wisdom. So all the things that before were burdens, wisdom, work, pleasure are now gifts. Why? Well, you say, I guess it's just saying that you have to base your life on God.

Yes, but how? What if you make it your meaning in life will change things such that now the things that  were burdens suddenly become gifts? One is what will give you meaning in life, that will last, they'll give you solid satisfaction  and a solid identity. What is it? It's not just obeying God, it's pleasing him.

Twice it says to the one who pleases God. Now, I want you to think about that for a second. What does it mean to live for somebody's pleasure? See, there's many people who say, oh, I've lived for God, and when I say, what do you mean? Well, I went to church and I obeyed the thing, Commandments, and I read my Bible every day.

Well, are you, but I'm not doing that anymore. I'm not religious anymore. Why not? Well, I prayed, and God never gave me anything that I asked for. I tried very hard.

I lived a good life, and yet he wasn't coming for it. You know, I didn't have good health. I didn't get into the school I wanted to get into. This and that bad happened. So you know what?

It's possible to obey God, not for God's sake, but for your sake. You're praying, you think you're very religious, but you're obeying God to get the things  here in this world, under the sun, and they're the real reason you're living. And then you have a meaning in life that is actually just as unstable. You've got an identity that's just as unstable as the so-called secular person. You may think of yourself very religious, but if you're living for God, you think,  in order to get things, to get blessings, to get health, to get success, you're just  as unstable as everybody else is, and you'll have that spiritual nausea, too.

Well, then what should you be? You should be someone who serves God, yes, and obeys God, yes, just to give him pleasure. Let me tell you what real love is. It's not just emotional. It's not just saying, I want a relationship with you because I desire you, and I'm attracted  to you, and being with you makes me happy.

That's part of it, but that's certainly not the heart of it. And also love is not mainly volitional. It's not just, well, I have to do my duty, and I have to serve you. Let me tell you what real love is. You know you love somebody when you put your happiness into their happiness, so that  your greatest happiness is just to see them happy.

You've inserted your happiness in their happiness, so that you don't make them happy to feel  good about yourself, and you don't just seek them just because it makes you... You put your happiness into their happiness, so when they're happy, you're happy. Their joy is your joy. Their delight is your delight. There's nothing beyond it.

Then you know you love somebody, then you know you love somebody. And the only way to get a meaningful life is not just to obey God in some dutiful way,  in which case you're still essentially building your life on things here, the death cams  can take away from you, and a lot of other things can do. You need to obey God because you just wanted to light him, because you adore him that much,  because you love him that much. Well, how does that happen, you say, arrow? This little thought experiment kind of ends, but there's a pointer in it to something  else.

There's commentators point out, point out, that God in these four verses, these three  verses are constantly giving gifts. God gives the gift of satisfaction, God gives the gift of finding enjoyment, God gives  the gift of wisdom and knowledge, and then guess what? He gives one more gift, you know, do you see what it is? He gives the center of the gift of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the  one who pleases God, this too is meaningless and chasing after the wind. The last thing he gives, the last gift he gives is he gives people the gift of futility and  meaninglessness.

Now, you say, how in the world is that a gift? Isn't that a punishment? Isn't that a curse? It depends on what you do with it. Because in Romans 18, it says, God subjected this world to futility, meaninglessness in hope.

If God gives you, right now, if God is giving you an enhanced feeling of meaninglessness  and futility in life, and this is New York, so I bet you that's true quite a number of  you. It could be a gift if you let it drive you to where you should go. It could be a gift if it points you, if it gets you somewhere, you say, well, where? What? Here's what you should be looking at.

In Jesus Christ died on the cross, he cried out, my God, my God, why has thou forsaken  me? Do you know what he was experiencing when he said that? He was experiencing life without God. He was praying to God and God wasn't there. He looked to the heavens and the heavens were brass.

He was stuck here. He was experiencing life without God. He was stuck under the sun. And he was experiencing spiritual nausea, profound nausea, spiritual futility, meaninglessness  because God wasn't there for him. Why was he doing that?

He was getting what we deserved. We've tried to get away from God and we deserve life without God. And the nausea and the meaninglessness, but Jesus Christ came, went to the cross to take  the punishment we deserve so that God can forgive us. And he can love us and we can connect to him. So Jesus Christ got life without God on the cross so that we can have life with God  or put it this way.

On the cross, Jesus was putting himself in our lives. He was inserting himself. He was putting himself in our misery. He was putting himself in our mortality. He was going to the depths for us.

That's love. He couldn't be happy unless we were happy. And so he put himself in our misery. And when you see him doing that, that will get you to want to just delight in him. When you see him sacrificing for you, when you see him putting his love into you, his  happiness into your happiness, that makes you want to put your happiness into his.

It makes you delight in him. And that is what you need. You can't just say, well, I need it the light and God. I need to be a God, please. I need to be someone who loves God and obeys God just in order to please Him.

You've got to see Him do this to attract you so that His pleasure is your pleasure,  that there's nothing that delights you more than the delight the one who did this for you. And then if you can do that, to the degree you can do that, you'll have a meaning in  life that is bomb proof, that is death can't prove. And everything in life will become a gift. Wow. That's quite a lesson, Professor.

Let us pray. Our Father, we thank You for helping us to see that Jesus Christ took the meaninglessness  of our lives. He took life without God so we could have life with you. And when we see Him doing that, that makes us want to please Him. Now Lord, as we protect the Lord's Supper, as we see in a sense, you pouring yourself out  for us, Lord Jesus Christ, move us so that we can delight in you more deeply and have  the life of meaning that sees everything as a gift.

We thank You for this. We pray You to apply it to our hearts by the Holy Spirit and Jesus name we pray, amen.

今天的经文阅读来自传道书第二章第9到26节。

> 我比以前在耶路撒冷的任何人都更伟大。在这一切中，我的智慧与我同在。我没有拒绝我眼睛所欲的任何东西。我没有拒绝我心中的任何快乐。我的心在我所有的劳作中得到了快乐，这是我所有辛劳的回报。当我审视我手所做的一切和我所努力达到的目标时，一切都是虚空，捕风捉影。在日光之下没有任何收获。

**主的话语。感谢上帝。**

### 主要思想实验：日光之下的生活

你知道吗，赫尔曼·梅尔维尔在《白鲸》第96章中说，传道书是世界上最真实的书。你当然知道这一点，你还知道是哪一章，对吧？传道书，你刚刚听到的，是世界上至少最令人困惑的书之一。肯定是第一次阅读时，因为它描绘了一个非常非常非常失望的人。

事实上，传道书的开头在第一节，这就是作者所说的，虚空，虚空，完全虚空，一切都是虚空。然后，当然，我们在第17节读到的那些话是非常鼓舞人心的。所以我恨恶生命，因为在日光之下所做的一切对我来说都是痛苦和虚空。

现在，令人困惑的原因是你在看这段经文时会说，圣经真的在说所有人类的生命都是无意义的吗？要理解这里发生的事情，你需要记住两件事。首先是作者是一个人，在传道书的第一章第一节，在书的开头。第一章第一节，作者被称为传道者。这是一个希伯来词，实际上很难翻译，但许多人会说，它的意思是教授。

### 享乐计划

在第1到11节，他想象自己生活在你想要的所有感官享乐中，感官享乐，我指的是感官的快乐。因此，在第1到11节，尽管它们没有印在这里的第二章中，他谈到他有一个后宫，有性，有食物，有房子，有仆人，他拥有每一种感官享乐，每一种感官的快乐，他在这里的第10节总结道，我没有拒绝我眼睛所欲的任何东西。我没有拒绝我心中的任何快乐，所以他为享乐而活，好吗？

**发生了什么？他告诉你，第11节，但当我审视一切时，一切都是虚空，捕风捉影，在日光之下没有任何收获。**

### 为智慧而活

他从享乐中转向智慧。我转向智慧、疯狂和愚昧。国王的继承者还能做什么呢？我看到智慧比愚昧更好，正如光明比黑暗更好，智慧的人头脑清醒，而愚昧的人在黑暗中行走。

**他在说什么？为智慧而活是什么意思？**

### 为成就而活

传道者说，好吧，如果我为成就而活呢？如果我不是为享乐而活，也不是为智慧、才华和洞察力而活，而是为成就而活呢？只是努力工作。当然，同样的事情发生了，你可以在第17节看到。所以我恨恶生命，因为在日光之下所做的一切工作对我来说都是痛苦的。如果这生命是我们所拥有的一切，在日光之下所做的一切工作对我来说都是痛苦的。这一切都是虚空，捕风捉影。

### 教训：没有神的虚无

理解传道书的方式是看重复的短语。因此，短语“日光之下”是第一个思想实验的关键。短语“虚空，虚空，这个是虚空，那个是虚空。”是教训。它在说，如果这生命是我们所能知道的一切。如果你把生命的意义建立在仅仅是这里的事物上，你就没有意义，没有持久的意义，也没有可持续的满足生活。

### 小思想实验：与神同在的生活

突然间，看，如果你在读传道书，除了在第一章的一个小地方，神这个词无处可见。因此，在第一章和第二章中，神这个词不在这里。为什么？因为这是一个思想实验。我们在看日光之下的生活。在第24到26节，神出现了。事实上，一直到第三章，神这个词被使用了十次。

**现在突然间，一切都改变了。神回到了画面中。**

### 虚无的礼物

他给的最后一件礼物是他给人们虚无和无意义的礼物。现在，你说，这怎么可能是礼物？这不是惩罚吗？这不是诅咒吗？这取决于你如何处理它。因为在罗马书18章中，它说，神使这个世界服从虚无，以希望。

### 结论：在基督中找到意义

在耶稣基督死在十字架上时，他喊道，我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？你知道他在说这话时经历了什么吗？他在经历没有神的生活。他在向神祷告，而神不在那里。他仰望天空，天空是铜墙铁壁。他被困在这里。他在经历没有神的生活。他被困在日光之下。他在经历精神上的恶心，深刻的恶心，精神上的虚无，无意义，因为神不在那里。

**他为什么这样做？他在承受我们应得的。**

让我们祷告。我们的父，我们感谢你帮助我们看到耶稣基督承受了我们生命的无意义。他承受了没有神的生活，以便我们可以拥有与你同在的生活。当我们看到他这样做时，这让我们想要取悦他。现在主，当我们保护主的晚餐时，当我们在某种意义上看到你为我们倾倒自己时，主耶稣基督，感动我们，以便我们可以更深地喜悦于你，并拥有看到一切都是礼物的有意义的生活。我们为此感谢你。我们祈求你通过圣灵将其应用于我们的心中，奉耶稣的名祷告，阿门。

## Chinese Transcript / 中文

今天的经文选自《传道书》第二章9到26节。我在耶路撒冷比以前所有的人更为尊大。在这一切事上，我的智慧仍然存留着。我眼所求的，没有不给它的；我心所乐的，我没有禁止不享受。

我心在一切劳碌中所喜乐的，就成了我从一切劳碌中所得的分。我查验我手所作的一切工和我劳碌所成的事，谁知都是虚空，都是捕风，在日光之下毫无益处。随后，我转念观看智慧、狂妄和愚昧。在王以后而来的人，还能做什么呢？也不过行早先所行的罢了。

我看出智慧胜过愚昧，如同光明胜过黑暗。智慧人的眼目光明，在黑暗中行走；愚昧人却在黑暗里行走。但我却看明，无论这人那人，都有一样的结局。我心里说：“愚昧人所遇见的，我也必遇见。我为何更有智慧呢？”我心里说：“这也是虚空。”

因为智慧人和愚昧人一样，永不被记念；日后日子多么久远，早已被人忘记。智慧人怎样死，愚昧人也怎样死。因此我厌烦生命，因为在日光之下所做的工在我看来都令人愁烦，都是虚空，都是捕风。我又恨恶我在日光之下所劳碌的一切，因为我必须把它留给我以后的人。

谁知道那人是智慧的，是愚昧的呢？然而他必管理我在日光之下用智慧劳碌所得的一切果子。这也是虚空。因此，我心里转向绝望，论到我在日光之下所劳碌的一切工作。

因为有人用智慧、知识和技能劳碌得来，所拥有的一切，却要留给未曾劳碌的人为分。这也是虚空，是大患。人在日光之下一切的劳碌和心里所受的烦恼，究竟得着什么呢？他一生的劳苦都成为愁烦和忧虑，连夜间心也不安。这也是虚空。

人莫强如吃喝，且在劳碌中享福。我看这也是出于神的手；因为离了他，谁能吃用，谁能享受呢？

神喜悦谁，就给谁智慧、知识和喜乐；惟有罪人，神使他劳苦、积蓄、收敛，为要交给神所喜悦的人。这也是虚空，都是捕风。主的话语。感谢上帝。

你们知道吗？赫尔曼·梅尔维尔在《白鲸》第96章里说，《传道书》是世界上最真实的一本书。你们当然早就知道了，而且连章节都记得，对吧？你刚才听到的《传道书》，至少是世界上最让人困惑的书之一。尤其是第一次读的时候，因为它描绘的是一个极其、极其、极其失望的人。事实上，在《传道书》一章的起头，作者这样说：“虚空的虚空，虚空的虚空，凡事都是虚空。”

然后，在我们所读经文里的第17节，还有那句“极其鼓舞人心”的话：“我厌恶生命，因为在日光之下所做的工在我看来都令人愁烦，都是虚空。”这就让人困惑了。你看着这段经文，会问：圣经真的在说一切人生都是毫无意义的吗？要明白这里在发生什么，你需要记住两件事。第一，在第一章第一节、也就是《传道书》开头，作者被称为“传道者”（原文是“Qoheleth”）。

这是一个希伯来词，其实很难翻译，但很多人认为，它的意思接近“老师”或“授课者”。那些上过好研究生研讨课的人都知道，一个研究生课堂里的教授通常不会站在那里讲道，甚至不只是讲课，而是用问题激你思考，让你自己想清楚。第二件重要的事，是要注意一个小词语，你可以在我们刚读的这段开头看见。经文说：“我在耶路撒冷比以前所有的人更为尊大，在这一切事上，我的智慧仍然存留着。”

他一再这样说：我为享乐而活，但“我的智慧仍然存留”；我在耶路撒冷所成就的超过以往任何人，“在这一切事上，我的智慧仍然存留”。这听起来有点奇怪，但其实是个旁白，意思是：这是一个思想实验。我在想象自己处在这样那样的处境。你们知道，如果我让你做一个思想实验，我通常会说：想象一下，如果你在这样的情境里，这些是条件，把你放进这个场景里，你会怎么想？这正是他在做的事。

所以他不时会说：“我的智慧仍然存留着我。”这其实是在说：现在注意，我在观察这一切，并且在思考：这教导了我们什么。有点像一个演员走上台开始扮演一个角色，但时不时走到台边，对观众说：“现在，从这里我们能学到什么？”“从那里我们又能学到什么？”这其实就是理解《传道书》的秘诀。它是一组思想实验，传道者在其中说：那么，让我们想象这样生活；再想象那样生活；看看我们看到了什么，这意味着什么？这样活行得通吗？

而那句“我的智慧仍然存留着我”就是在说：是的，我在做这个思想实验，但我仍然是我自己。所以，我开始为某件事而活，但我同时在观察自己。明白了吗？因此，如果你想理解《传道书》到底在做什么，我们需要看看这些思想实验。我会先给你看一个大的思想实验和它的主要结论。然后，在我们所读的这段经文里，还有一个小一点的思想实验，以及一个“箭头”。好吧，一个大的思想实验加一个教训，再加一个小的思想实验和一个指向。

准备好了吗？我们开始。首先是大的那个，大的实验。这场大的思想实验，是要教我们如何看待“日光之下”的人生。你会看到，《传道书》全书用了大约三十次“日光之下”这个短语。你会注意到，他并不是说“人生是虚空”，而是说“在日光之下的人生是虚空”。

他在第11节说：“在日光之下毫无益处”；又说“都是虚空，都是捕风，在日光之下”；你在第11节看到，在第17、20、22节也看到，全书大概出现了三十次。那么，这是什么意思呢？注释家和学者们会说，当他讲“在日光之下”的人生时，他的意思是：我只考虑地上今生的生活，不把永恒和上帝算进去。我们先假装一下：假如此生就是一切会怎样？这就是他在做的事。

这就是所谓的“世俗心态”。这里你得小心：作一个“世俗的人”并不一定等于“无神论者”。当然，《传道书》的作者在他那个时代几乎不可能遇见无神论者，当时几乎没有这样的人。甚至在今天，尽管我们基本生活在一个世俗文化中，真正的无神论者比例其实也不算高。但加拿大哲学家查尔斯·泰勒在他那本很厚、大家都觉得很重要的《世俗时代》里说：世俗并不等于你不信上帝、不信来世，而是说：没有人能真的知道有没有上帝，也没有人能真的知道有没有来世。

因此，这个世界——顺便说一句，“secular”这个词来自拉丁文“saeculum”，意思是“今世”或“此时此刻”——一个世俗心态说：也许有上帝，也许没有；也许有来世，也许没有。但我们所能确知的只有这个世界、这段今生、眼前的时空。所以，一个世俗的人会说：也许有神也许没有，但我们必须在这里找到安慰、找到快乐、找到意义，只能在今生找到。这就是“日光之下”的人生。

所以，这个巨大的思想实验——《传道书》很大一部分就是在做这件事——基本上是在说：好，我们来做个实验。我将把人生看成：此生是我们唯一能知道的全部。我只把生命建基在今生能够拥有的事物上。然后我来问：就这个体系本身来看，这样的人生有没有意义？就它自己的标准来说，它令人满足吗？这就是他所做的。

他从三个方面来做这个“日光之下”的实验：如果你假设今生就是一切，意味着什么？首先的一种方式，可以叫“享乐计划”。在2章1到11节——其实是1到11节，虽然没有都印在讲义上——他想象自己尽情享受一切感官的快乐。所谓“感官的快乐”，就是五官所能感受到的愉悦。他在1到11节里说，他有后宫，有性；有美食，有房屋，有仆人；他享有一切感官享受、一切感官的快乐。他在第10节总结说：“凡我眼所求的，我没有不给它的；我心所乐的，我没有禁止不享受。”

换句话说，他为了享乐而活。那么结果如何呢？他告诉你：第11节，“我察看我所经营的一切事和我劳碌所成的功，谁知都是虚空，都是捕风，在日光之下毫无益处。”顺便说一句，“捕风”这个比喻用来形容“为享乐而活”的人生，实在太贴切了。

当你为享乐而活时，就好像在追赶风。为什么这么说呢？风是你能感觉到的，对吧？你当然能感觉到风。但你试着去抓住它，试着跑到它前面，或是用手把它捧住——你做不到。所有的快乐其实都像这样。当你为快乐而活时，你会发现：是的，它感觉很美好，但你越想抓住，它消散得越快。

多年前，有一位住在纽约的女作家，她为《村声》写专栏，名字叫辛西娅·海梅尔。后来她搬到洛杉矶，不再写《村声》，而是给《花花公子》写稿。她是个很讽刺锋利的作者。1989年——也就是我搬到纽约的那一年——她在《村声》写了一篇专栏，我到现在都记得很清楚。她说，她认识一些人，原本在夜店当保镖、在衣帽间看衣服之类的，后来成了大明星。她在文中点名说，她认识某位女星，当年只是在梅西百货化妆品柜台打工；又认识某位男星，当年只是在电影院撕票。如今他们都成了赫赫有名的电影明星。

她说，在每一个例子里，不管是她亲自认识、还是通过朋友打听到的，那些人后来都比成名之前更加不快乐、更愤怒、更焦虑。她用一种很讽刺的口吻写道——我照着剪报念给你听：“他们一直在追逐那个巨大的东西——那个‘成名’的东西——以为一旦有了，它就能让一切都好起来，让他们的人生变得可以忍受，能把他们填满幸福。那件事终于发生了，他们也真的成名了，但他们仍然还是他们自己。于是幻灭把他们变成了咆哮又难以相处的人。”

这正是《传道书》的传道者在说的。他说，当你为享乐而活时，根本行不通。它就是行不通。它像捕风一样——抓不住。就其本身而言，一个“为快乐而活”的人生，最终并不快乐；所有这样活过的人，最后都会这样说。

那么，如果你认定“今生就是全部”，除了享乐，还能怎样活呢？第二条路，就是他在第12节所说的“智慧”：于是我转念观看智慧、狂妄和愚昧。他离开了享乐，转而尝试“智慧”。“我转念观看智慧、狂妄和愚昧。王之后来的人还能做什么呢？不过行早先所行的罢了。我看出智慧胜过愚昧，如同光明胜过黑暗；智慧人的眼目光明，在黑暗中行走；愚昧人却在黑暗里行走。”

他在说什么？“为智慧而活”是什么意思？在这里，既然他是在做“日光之下”的思想实验，那么“智慧”在这里，很大程度上指的就是“哲学”。按定义，从古希腊开始——可以说哲学就是他们发明的——哲学就是试图只用人的理性、不借助宗教，来寻找人生的意义、来决定人应该如何活。并不是没有“宗教哲学家”，但大体来说，哲学的核心就是：用理性去追问人生的意义、人该怎么活，而不诉诸宗教、上帝之类的观念。

希腊人当然是最早也是可能最杰出的一批哲学家。他们提出了各种各样的理论，试图了解宇宙背后是什么、世界背后有什么样的“道理”和“道德秩序”，好让我们按照那套秩序去活，就能顺着宇宙的“纹理”而行，活出充实而有智慧的人生。哲学家的工作，就是要说：什么是正确的活法？什么是智慧的活法？什么是与真实世界、与宇宙的纹理相契合的活法？

传道者说，他也进去做这样的事。他开始为学习、为学术、为“智慧”而活。但你看，结果如何？我觉得这一段非常惊人，也是这卷书伟大之处的一部分。他说：“我就看明，无论这人那人，都有一件事必然临到他们，就是都要死。”换句话说，聪明人和傻子最后的下场是一样的。那个拼命要成为智慧人的人，那些哲学家，用尽心力思索：人生的意义是什么？人应该怎样活？什么是对，什么是错？什么是公义？怎样定义公义？他们苦思冥想，想要让世界变得更好。可结果如何呢？

然后我在耶路撒冷所成就的，比以前所有的人都多；在这一切事上，我的智慧仍然存留着。这听起来有点奇怪，但其实是个旁白，表明他在做什么——这是古人表达“思想实验”的一种方式。他在说：我在想象自己处在这样的处境。如果我让你做一个思想实验，我通常会说：想象一下这样、再想象一下那样，这是前提条件，把你自己放到这个场景里——你会怎么想？这就是他在做的事。

所以，他时不时会说：“我的智慧仍然存留着我。”意思是：你看，我在经历这些事的时候，同时在思考，这些事教导我们什么。这有点像一个演员走上舞台扮演一个角色，然后时不时走到台边，对观众说：“现在，我们可以从这一幕学到什么；再从那一幕学到什么。”其实，这就是理解《传道书》的关键。整卷书是一组思想实验：这位“老师”在说，我们来想象这样活、再想象那样活，然后看看我们看到了什么？这意味着什么？这样活行不行得通？

而那句“我的智慧仍然存留着我”，就是在说：是的，我在做这个思想实验，但我仍然是我自己。因此，我开始为这些东西而活，但同时在观察自己。懂了吗？所以，如果你想知道《传道书》到底要表达什么，我们就需要看清这些思想实验。让我先给你看一个大的思想实验和它的结论。然后，在这段经文里，还有一个小一点的思想实验，以及一个“箭头”——一个指向。

所以，大的那个先来。第一个，是主要的那个、大的那个。这个巨大的思想实验，是在教我们如何看待“日光之下”的人生。你会发现，《传道书》中大约有三十次用到“日光之下”这个词。你也会注意到，他说的并不是“人生是虚空”，而是“在日光之下的人生是虚空”。

经文说，在第11节：“在日光之下毫无益处。”他说：“都是虚空，都是捕风，在日光之下。”你在第11节看到这句话，在第17、20、22节也看到，整卷书大概用了三十次。那么，这是什么意思呢？

注释家和学者说，当他说“我观看日光之下的生命”时，他的意思是：我只考虑地上的生活，不把永恒、不把上帝放进视野。我们先假装一下：如果这一生就是全部呢？这就是他在做的事。

这就是所谓的“世俗心态”。这里要小心：“世俗的人”并不等于“无神论者”。当然，《传道书》的作者在他那个时代几乎不可能认识无神论者——那时候几乎没人否认神的存在。甚至在今天，虽然我们基本活在一个世俗文化里，真正的无神论者比例其实也不算太高。

但加拿大哲学家查尔斯·泰勒写了一本很厚、大家都觉得重要的书，谈“世俗时代”。他指出：“世俗”并不意味着你不信上帝或不信来世，而是说：没有人能真正知道有没有上帝，也没有人能真正知道有没有来世。因此，这个世界——顺便说，“secular”这个英文词来自拉丁文“saeculum”，意思是“今世”或“此时此刻”——世俗心态基本上在说：也许有神，也许没有；也许有来世，也许没有。但我们所能确知的，只有这个世界、这段今生、眼前的时空。

所以，一个世俗的人会说：不管有没有神，我们必须在此处找到安慰，在这里找到快乐，在这个今生里找到意义。那就是“日光之下”的人生。因此，这个巨大的思想实验——也是《传道书》很大一部分的核心——基本是在说：好，就这么定了。我要把人生当成：今生是我们唯一能知道的一切。然后，我只把生命建基在此时此地可以得到的事物上。接着，我要问：就这个体系本身来说，这样的人生有没有意义？就它自己的标准来说，这样的生活是否满足？

这就是他在做的。他从三个方面来做这个“日光之下”的实验：如果你假定今生就是全部，意味着什么？其中一种方式，就是我们可以称之为“享乐计划”的东西。

在第1到11节——其实是第1到11节，虽然这里没有全部印出来——他想象自己享有一切可能的感官快乐。“感官的快乐”指的是五官的愉悦。所以在2章1到11节，他谈到自己有后宫，有性；有美食，有房屋，有仆人；他享有所有的感官享受、所有感官所能提供的乐趣。他在第10节这样总结：“凡我眼所求的，我没有不给它的；我心所乐的，我没有禁止不享受。”换句话说，他为快乐而活。

那么结果如何呢？他告诉你：第11节，“我察看我手所经营的一切事和我劳碌所成的功，谁知都是虚空，都是捕风，在日光之下毫无益处。”顺带一提，“捕风”这个词用来形容“为享乐而活”的人生，实在再贴切不过了。

当你为享乐而活，就像在追赶风。为什么这么说呢？风是你能真实感觉到的，对吧？你当然能感觉到风。但你试着抓住它，试着跑在它前面，或试着把它握在手里——你做不到。所有的快乐其实都像这样：当你为快乐而活时，你会发现，是的，它的确让你感觉很好，可是就在你想抓紧它的同时，它已经在消散。

多年前，有一位住在纽约的女士，为《村声》写专栏，名字叫辛西娅·海梅尔（Cynthia Heimel）。后来她搬到洛杉矶，不再给《村声》写稿，而是为《花花公子》撰文。她是个非常讽刺、犀利的作者。我来念一段剪报给你听：

她那篇1989年的专栏——也就是我搬到纽约的那一年——里提到，她认识几个当年只是夜店保镖、衣帽间看衣服之类的人物，后来都成了大明星。她点名说，她认识某位女星，当年只是在梅西百货的化妆品柜台打工；又认识某位男星，当年只是在电影院门口撕票。如今他们都成了家喻户晓的电影明星。

她说，在每个例子里，不管是她仍然认识的人，还是她通过朋友打听到的，那些人后来都比成名之前更不快乐、更愤怒、更加焦虑。她用一种带着几分玩世不恭的口吻写道：“他们追逐的那个巨大的东西——那个名声的东西——本来以为一旦得着，它就会让一切都好起来，让他们的生活变得可以忍受，能把他们充满幸福。这件事终于发生了，他们真的得到了名声，但他们仍然还是他们自己。于是，幻灭把他们变成了咆哮又令人难以忍受的人。”

这跟《传道书》的传道者讲的一模一样。他说，当你为享乐而活时，它根本行不通。它就是行不通。它就像捕风——你抓不住。就其本身而言，“为快乐而活”的人生最终并不真正快乐；而这样活过的人，最后都会这么说。

她一个个点出他们的名字。她认识那位后来家喻户晓的女明星，当年只是在梅西百货化妆品柜台上班；她也认识那位后来大红大紫的男明星，当年只是在电影院门口撕票。如今，他们都成了大明星。她说，在每一个例子里，不管是她仍然熟识的人，还是她通过朋友打听到的，那些人后来都比成功之前更不快乐。他们更愤怒，也更焦虑。

于是，她带着几分冷嘲地写下这样一段话（我直接从剪报上念给你听）：“那个他们一直渴望的大东西——那个名望的东西——本来应该让一切都好起来，本来应该让他们的生活变得可以忍受，本来应该把他们填满幸福，它终于发生了。但他们还是他们自己。幻灭把他们变成了咆哮又叫人难以忍受的人。”

这正是《传道书》的传道者所说的。你看，当你为享乐而活，它就是行不通。就是行不通。那样的生活就像“捕风”。就其本身而言，为享乐而活的人生并不真正快乐；所有为此而活过的人，最后都会这么说。

那么，要是在这个前设下——“今生就是一切”——你还可以为什么而活呢？另一个选项，是他在第12节提到的：他转而追求“智慧”。“于是我转念观看智慧、狂妄和愚昧。”他离开享乐，开始尝试智慧。“我转念观看智慧、狂妄和愚昧。后来者还能做什么呢？不过行早先所行的罢了。我看出智慧胜过愚昧，如同光明胜过黑暗；智慧人的眼目光明，在黑暗中行走；愚昧人却在黑暗里行走。”

他在谈什么？所谓“为智慧而活”是什么意思？大概是这样的：在这个“日光之下”的思想实验中，“智慧”在这里其实主要指“哲学”。按定义，从希腊人发明哲学以来，哲学就是试图只用人的理性来弄清楚人生的意义、人该如何生活，而不诉诸宗教。

并不是说没有宗教哲学家，但总体而言，哲学的基本构想就是：你用理性、靠思考来追问人生的意义、人应该如何生活，而不求助于宗教、上帝之类的观念。希腊人当然是最早的一批哲学家，可能也是最好的一批。他们用各种方式去探索：人生的意义是什么？宇宙背后是什么？世界背后有什么样的道德秩序，使我们若顺着那条“纹理”去活，就能活出充实而有智慧的人生。

哲学家的工作，就是要说：什么才是正确的活法？什么是智慧的活法？什么样的活法是顺着现实世界的“纹理”在前行？传道者说，他也走进这条路。他开始为学习、为学问、为“智慧”而活。但你看，结果如何？这其实是这卷书最精彩的部分之一。

他在第14节说：“我就看明，无论这人那人，都有一件事必然临到他们。”谁？就是智慧人和愚昧人。那位拼命想要成为智慧人的人，那位哲学家，苦苦追问：人生的意义是什么？人应当怎样活？什么是对、什么是错？什么是公义？如何定义公义？他不断思考、不停地想，想要让世界变得更美好。但结果呢？

“我心里说：愚昧人所遇见的，我也必遇见。我又说：我所得的智慧又有什么益处呢？这也是虚空。因为智慧人和愚昧人一样，都必被人忘记……愚昧人怎样死，智慧人也怎样死。”

这非常耐人寻味。事实上，在整部哲学史上，如果你读到萨特、克尔凯郭尔、加缪这些人，你会发现，他们最后基本也是这么说的：如果此生就是全部，如果人死了就腐烂，如果太阳熄灭，整个人类文明就一起死去，不再有人记得我们做过什么，那意味着什么？那意味着你怎么活都无所谓；你是个善良的人还是恶劣的人无所谓；你是个慈善家还是连环杀手，在最终结果上是一样的。

想想看：如果此生真的是全部，那就算人类文明能存在一百万年——我倒不觉得能——或者两百万年，甚至十亿年，好了。即便如此，跟在宇宙成形之前那无边无际的“死寂的时间”相比——那段时间里什么都还没有；又或者跟太阳燃尽、文明彻底消失之后那无边无际的“死寂的时间”相比——就算人类文明能撑十亿年，那也不过像是一瞬、一秒、一点小小的火花而已。

到头来，所做的一切，都不会再有人记得；所有人都会被遗忘。这意味着什么？意味着你所做的一切，都毫无真正的分量；你所做的一切，不会造成最终的差异；你所做的一切，都没有终极意义。你可能会说：“可是它有意义啊，因为它让世界变得更好。”问题是：能变好多久？

如果此生就是全部，你所做的一切，在终极意义上都无足轻重；所有的“哲学”也都无足轻重。活得智慧与否、活得善良与否，和活得愚昧、活得邪恶，到最后没有区别。

还不止如此。他接着思考：“那工作呢？”传道者说，如果我为“成就”而活呢？假如我不是为享乐而活，也不是为智慧、为聪明、为洞见而活，而只是为“成就”、为“事业”而活呢？为努力工作本身而活呢？

你会看到，结果还是一样。第17节说：“我厌恶生命，因为在日光之下所做的工在我看来都令人愁烦。”如果此生就是全部，那么“在日光之下所做的一切工”在我看来都令人愁烦。“都是虚空，都是捕风。”为什么？他给了两个理由，而且非常有意思。

首先他说：“我恨恶我在日光之下所劳碌的一切，因为我必须把它留给我以后的人。谁知道那人是智慧的，是愚昧的呢？”这一点，我想让你认真想一想。事实上，让我在这里稍微推你一下：他讲的是铁一般的事实。

对吧，你们都知道这些人，这是毫无疑问的事实。

所有那些竭力推动哈佛、耶鲁和普林斯顿成立的人，那些在两百多年前倾其财力去建立哈佛、耶鲁和普林斯顿的人，如果他们今天突然复活，看到现在哈佛、耶鲁和普林斯顿在教些什么，他们一定会震惊得目瞪口呆，对吧？他们会完全被震惊到。他们会说：“把我的钱还给我。”

然后你会说——其实大家都会说——“是啊当然啦，可你看，那是很久以前的人，而我们现在已经开化、觉醒了。”你懂吧？“当然不可能再教他们当年教的那些东西了，我们现在开明多了。”但你要意识到一件事：一百年之后，你的曾孙、玄孙，如果你有的话，也会觉得他们一样是“觉醒的”，而你一样是愚蠢的。你现在自以为多么进步、多么正确的那些信念，只不过是与一百年前那些可怜、天真、不开化的人不一样而已。

你知道，一百年后，人们看你，也会像你今天看一百年前的人那样。而你所做的一切，即便其中有些事值得保留、值得流传下去，最终也可能只是被那些在你眼里是“愚人”的人拿去使用。

因此，你所做的一切，终究不会真正成就什么。你不会成就任何事——完全成不了什么大事。如果今生就是全部，那这一切都是毫无意义的。

而你从这一切中能得到什么呢？看第 23 节：“他一生的事业都是愁烦和苦恼，连夜间心也不安。”你一生都在焦虑，一生都在不安，一生都在拼命地忙碌工作。

到头来，一切都归于虚无。思想实验到这里就结束了。那结论是什么？其实结论非常清楚。

要理解《传道书》，你必须留意那些不断重复的词句、那些反复出现的短语。

在第一个思想实验里，“日光之下”这个短语就是关键；而“虚空的虚空”，“这是虚空，那也是虚空”，这些重复也在表达同一个结论：如果我们所能认识的只有今生，如果你把人生意义建立在“此世之物”上，你就没有真正的意义，没有持久的意义。

也不会有一种可以持续、长久、令人真正满足的生命。

现在你知道，近年来那些“新无神论者”，也就是这几年写了许多非常激进的无神论著作的人，并不认同这一点。他们不喜欢我刚才说的话。因为我在这里——其实也是“传道者”，那位老师——在说：如果“日光之上”并没有生命，如果这个世界就是我们所有的一切，如果我们只能为此世之物而活，那么生命就没有意义，没有真正坚固的意义。

而他们当然会说：“不对。”

斯蒂芬·杰伊·古尔德，曾经在纽约大学和哈佛任教（他已经去世了），有一次被问到：“我们为什么会在这里？我们存在的目的是什么？”他回答说：“嗯，我们之所以在这里，是因为有一群鱼，恰好长出了一种特殊的鱼鳍结构，可以演化成长在陆地上生物的腿。”然后他接着说：“我们也许渴望一个更高层次的答案，但并不存在这样的答案。”

换句话说，我们是在这里是因为偶然。没有谁特意把我们放在这里。他说：“这个解释从表面看也许令人困扰、甚至惊恐，但最终却是让人得自由的。”为什么？因为我们既然不能从自然中获得人生的意义，就必须自己构造这些答案。

理查德·道金斯也是类似的说法。他说：“真正成熟的观点是：我们的生命有多有意义、多美好，完全取决于我们自己愿意赋予它多少意义、多少美好。”

他们的意思是什么呢？他们是在说：是的，当然，当古尔德说“你无法从自然事实中读出意义”时，他的意思是，

你不能问：“我们是为了什么被放在这里？我们存在的目的是什么？我们的意义是什么？是谁把我们放在这里？”答案是：没人把我们放在这里，我们就是莫名其妙出现了。我们是偶然出现的，当我们死了，便是黑暗一片。

但他们说，你可以自己决定要赋予生命什么意义。你可以决定：“我要为解决非洲饥荒而活。”你可以决定：“我要为某个事业而活”，或者“我要为成为一个好艺术家而活。”你自己来决定你要为什么而活，就可以拥有一个完全有意义的人生。你决定你要为什么而活。

但这条路是行不通的。不仅“传道者”、这位老师已经论证了这条路为何不行，它只在一种情况下看似成立——那就是你不愿意认真思考的时候。只要你认真思考，它就站不住脚。

维克多·弗兰克，

那位在二战期间被关进集中营、但后来活下来的犹太心理学家，写过很多书。他的许多思想，我一直觉得非常有意思，也可以应用到很多领域上。现在，我想把其中的一些应用到这里。

弗兰克观察到，在集中营里，有些囚犯失去了一切。有些人开始变坏，他们开始偷其他囚犯的东西，开始与敌人合作。还有一些人像行尸走肉一样，整个人完全失落；有些甚至真的就缩在一角，慢慢等死。

换句话说，他们失去了自我。

但也有一些囚犯始终坚强，勇敢，内在挺立，仍然关心别人，仍然愿意付出。

问题是：为什么？为什么有些人一进集中营，就在某种意义上“消失了”，丧失了自己；而有些人却始终保持自己是谁？差别在哪里？

弗兰克的结论是：这取决于他们把人生的意义安放在什么上面。

因为，如果你把人生意义放在一个集中营可以夺走的事物上，你就再也没有“自我”可言了。

那么，集中营能够夺走哪些东西呢？任何“日光之下”的东西。

如果你说：“我为家庭而活”，你可能觉得自己很高尚——“我为家人活着。”但集中营可以一并夺走。你的家人可能被杀死，你不知道他们在哪里，他们被带走，可能全都死了。

如果你为某个政治事业而活呢？如果你为地位活、为事业活、为赚钱活、为性和浪漫活呢？你无论为什么而活，只要那是属于今世的、属于“日光之下”的东西，集中营都能把它夺走。

结果就是：你再也没有“自我”可言了。

唯一那些仍然坚强、仍然做回自己的人，是那些为集中营夺不走的东西而活的人——为超越“日光之下”的东西而活，比如上帝，比如信仰，比如某种超越性的真理。

因此，结论是：你其实不能靠自己“创造”意义；你必须在某个比你更高、更伟大的真实当中，去“发现”意义。

再说一遍：你不能靠自己创造意义，

你其实做不到道金斯说的那种事，你不能靠自己创造意义。

你必须通过发现一个比你更重要的真实，来“发现意义”。

如果你说：“嗯，我决定要为那个而活，我的人生意义就在那儿。不，我改主意，我要为另外那个而活。”——你看，你根本没有一个真正“高过你自己”的东西来赋予你意义。

你依然只是在为自己而活，只是在服侍自己。你之所以那样做，是因为那会让你对自己感觉良好；你之所以那样做，是因为那让你觉得满足、觉得舒服。换句话说，你还是在为自己而活。

你并没有真正的意义。没有什么比你更高、更大的终极意义在托住你。而且，你也没有一个可以长久维系的意义。

不仅集中营可以把它夺走，各式各样的事情都可以把它从你身上拿走。你是知道这一点的。当那一切被拿走时，你的“自我”也随之瓦解。

但如果你为上帝而活，如果你为他而活，把人生的意义建立在“日光之上”、在超越此世之物的那一位上，没有任何东西能够把那从你身上夺走。你明白吗？

因此，你看——是萨特说得对，不是道金斯说得对。存在主义者在这一点上是对的，他们这样说：

如果你的“来源”是没有意义的——我们是偶然存在的；你的“归宿”也是没有意义的——你将归于虚无；

而道金斯却说：“好吧，我们的确是偶然存在的，没有人把我们放在这里；我们死了就腐烂。但与此同时，我们还是可以过一种有意义的生活，你可以自己决定要为什么而活。”

萨特基本上则说：如果你的来处是无意义的，你的归宿是无意义的，那你就要有勇气承认——你整个生命都是没有意义的，中间所有发生的一切也都没有意义。

而克尔凯郭尔——对不起，我刚才提的是萨特——克尔凯郭尔在 1849 年写过一本小书，叫《致死的疾病》（The Sickness unto Death）。那本书写的是什么？写的是，当你试图把生命意义建在此世之物上时，心里产生的一种属灵的反胃——一种持续的恐惧与不安，一直惶惶不宁，像是在追赶一个永远也追不上的东西。你总是焦虑，总是好像抓不住什么。这是一种属灵的恶心感，一种深层的虚无感、徒劳感，潜伏在你做的每一件事下面。

我认为，萨特写他那本名著《恶心》（Nausea）的灵感，很可能就是从这里来的：如果你的来处是无意义的，你的归宿也是无意义的，

那你就要有勇气承认，你的一生都是没有意义的。

好了，这就是那个“大实验”，以及从中得出的结论。

那“小实验”是什么呢？这里还有一个更小的思想实验。幸好，对你们这些正在看表的人来说，这个小实验不会像刚才那个大实验那样花那么多时间。

它只出现在第 24、25、26 节里。

你会发现很突然——如果你在读《传道书》——此前“上帝”这个词几乎看不到，只在第一章开头出现过一小下。所以，从第一章到第二章，大部分段落里几乎都没有提到神。

为什么？因为那是在做思想实验，我们在看“日光之下”的人生图景。

可在 24 到 26 节，神突然出现了。事实上一直延伸到第三章，“上帝”这个词被用了十次。

作者说：“人莫强如吃喝，且在劳碌中享福。我看这也是出于神的手。论到吃用，享福，谁能胜过我呢？神喜悦谁，就给谁智慧、知识和喜乐。”

你看，神一入场，一切都变了。

于是，我们有了一个新的思想实验。这一次，我们来看看：如果把神放在生命中心，人生会变成什么样？

刚才那些被形容为“捕风”的东西，那些永远抓不牢、永远觉得是重担、是空虚的东西，现在突然成了礼物。

你看，第 24 节说：工作成了礼物，“在劳碌中享福”。“这也是出于神的手”——是神赐我们在工作中得满足。

第 25 节说，神甚至让我们在每日的饮食中得享快乐。你不需要丰盛的筵席和节期，如果神在图景里，即便是每天普通的饮食，也可以成为礼物；你可以在劳碌中得满足。

而且，

经文又说，“神喜悦谁，就给谁智慧”。所以，那些原先让人觉得是重担的东西——智慧、工作、享乐——如今都成了礼物。为什么？

你可能会说：“哦，我明白了，这段经文就是在说：你必须把生命建在神身上。”

是的，但问题是：怎么建？

到底是什么，会在你的生命中起到“赋予意义”的作用，强大到足以把那些原本是重担的东西，翻转成礼物？

什么才能给你一个足以持久的意义、一个稳固的满足和稳固的身份？

答案是什么呢？不只是“顺服神”，而是“讨他喜悦”。

经文两次提到“神所喜悦的人”。

现在我想请你认真想一想：为一个人的“喜悦”而活，到底意味着什么？

有很多人会说：“哦，我是为神而活的。”我如果追问：“你是什么意思？”他们会回答：“我去教会，我遵守十诫，我每天读圣经。”但接下来你会听到他们说：“不过我现在不再这么做了，我现在不再宗教了。”

“为什么？”

“因为我以前祷告，可神从来没有给我想要的东西。我非常努力，我过了好一阵子的好行为，可他却没有按我想要的方式出手。我没有得到健康，也没考上我想去的学校，这样那样的坏事发生。所以你知道吗，我不干了。”

你看，一个人是完全有可能“顺服神”，却不是为了神，而是为了自己。

你祷告，你觉得自己很敬虔，但你顺服神是为了要得到这世界上的东西——“日光之下”的东西——它们才是你真正活着的原因。

结果，你依然把人生意义压在同样不稳定的东西上。你的身份同样摇摆不定，跟那些所谓“世俗”的人其实没什么本质差别。

你也许自认很属灵、很宗教，但如果你为神而活只是为了从他那里拿东西，拿祝福、拿健康、拿成功，那你跟别人一样不稳定——你同样会有那种属灵的恶心感。

那我们应该成为什么样的人呢？

我们应该是这样的人：我们服侍神，是的；我们顺服神，是的；但我们这样做，仅仅是为了让他喜悦。

让我来告诉你什么才是真正的“爱”。爱不只是情绪，不只是说：“我要跟你建立关系，因为我渴望你，我被你吸引，跟你在一起让我很快乐。”这当然是爱的一部分，但绝对不是核心。

爱也不主要是意志层面的，不只是说：“好吧，我得尽我的责任，我得服侍你。”

真正的爱是什么？你知道你真正在爱一个人，是当你把“自己的快乐”放进“对方的快乐”里面——以至于，你最大的快乐，就是看见他快乐。

你已经把自己的幸福放进了他的幸福里。

于是，你不会是为了让自己感觉良好才去让他快乐；你也不会只是因为

让你……你把自己的快乐放进对方的快乐里，所以，当他快乐的时候，你也快乐；他的喜乐就是你的喜乐，他的满足就是你的满足，除此之外你别无所求。

当你这样的时候，你就知道，你是真的爱上了这个人——那才是真正的爱。

而获得一段“有意义的人生”的唯一方式，不是那种仅仅“尽本分式”的顺服——那种顺服其实仍然是把生命建在此世之物上，那些集中营可以从你身上夺走的东西，还有许许多多别的事也可以夺走。

你需要的是这样一种顺服：你顺服神，只是因为你想使他喜悦——因为你那么敬慕他，因为你那么爱他。

那么问题来了——这怎么可能发生呢？

这个小小的思想实验在这里好像嘎然而止，但其实它指向了别的东西。注释家们指出，在这三、四节经文里，神不断地在“赐礼物”：

神赐下“在劳碌中得满足”的礼物；
神赐下“能享受”的礼物；
神赐下“智慧和知识”的礼物。

然后，你看，他又赐了一样礼物——你注意到是什么了吗？

经文说，他使那罪人“劳碌、积蓄、收藏”，好把所积蓄的交给神所喜悦的人；作者说：“这也是虚空，也是捕风。”

也就是说，神最后赐下的那份礼物，是“让人经历虚空与徒劳”的礼物。

你会说：“这怎么会是礼物？这不是惩罚吗？这不是咒诅吗？”

要看你怎么回应它。

因为在《罗马书》八章里说：“神使受造之物服在虚空之下”，却是“指望”——带着盼望这样做的。

如果现在，神正在把一种格外强烈的虚无感、徒劳感放在你心里——而这里是纽约，我敢说在座很多人都是这样——如果这一切发生，是为了把你推向一个该去的地方，那它就成了礼物。如果它逼你往某个方向走、指向某个对象，那就成了礼物。

你会问：“那我要往哪里去？我要看什么？”

你应该去看的，是这样的场景：耶稣基督在十字架上死的时候，他呼喊说：“我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？”

你知道他在说这话时正在经历什么吗？他在经历一种“没有神的人生”。他在向神祷告，却得不到回应；

他仰望天，却发现天像铜一样紧闭。

他被困在这下面，被困在“日光之下”。

他在经历一种没有神同在的生命，经历一种属灵的恶心——极深的属灵虚空、徒劳，因为神不再向他显现。

那么，他为什么要这样做？

他在承受的是我们该得的结局。我们曾经一次次想要逃离神，我们应得的就是“没有神的人生”——连同那一切恶心、虚无与空洞。

可是耶稣基督来了，走上十字架，承担了原本该落在我们身上的刑罚，好让神可以赦免我们，可以爱我们，我们也可以重新与他连接。

所以，可以这样说：耶稣基督在十字架上经历了“没有神的生命”，好让我们可以拥有“与神同在的生命”。或者换一种说法：

在十字架上，耶稣把自己放进了我们的生命里。他介入到我们当中，把自己置身在我们的痛苦里，把自己放进我们的必死性里，他下到最深的地方，为我们而去。

这就是真爱。

他不能在我们不快乐的时候快乐，因此他把自己投进了我们的苦难里。

当你看见他这样做的时候，这会激发你只想以他为乐。

当你看见他为你牺牲，当你看见他把自己的爱和喜乐放进你的生命里，这会使你也想把自己的喜乐放进他的喜乐里——

这会让你以他为乐。

而这，正是你所需要的。

你不能只是对自己说：“哦，我得学会以神为乐，我得做一个讨神喜悦的人，我得做一个爱神、顺服神、只为讨他喜悦而活的人。”

你必须先看见他为你做了这一切——这一切会吸引你，使他的喜乐成为你的喜乐，使你最深的欢喜，就是让那位为你这样做的主得着欢喜。

一旦你能这样——或者说，在你能这样做的那一个程度上——你就会拥有一个“防爆”的生命意义：连死亡营都无法摧毁的意义。

而你生命中的万事，也都会开始变成礼物。

哇，这真是一堂了不起的课，教授。

我们一起祷告。

天父，我们感谢你，让我们看见耶稣基督担当了我们生命的虚空。他承担了“没有神的生命”，好让我们可以拥有“与你同在的生命”。

当我们看见他这样做，就会生发出想要讨他喜悦的心。

现在，主啊，当我们领受圣餐的时候，当我们在某个意义上看见你为我们倾倒自己的时候——主耶稣基督，求你感动我们，使我们

能够更深地以你为乐，并得着那真正有意义的生命——那种把一切都看作礼物的生命。

我们为此感谢你，求你借着圣灵把这一切应用在我们的心上。奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。
