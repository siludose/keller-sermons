## English Transcript / 英文原文

Today puts a front page article about it. What they do is they go through the Bible and they color code the Bible, biblical verses. What they'll do is they'll give red, if they say Jesus probably said this, it probably  really happened. They give pink if it might be true. They give gray if it's probably not true and they give black if it's not true at all.

And generally, the Jesus Seminar says no more than 15 to 20 percent of what the Bible actually  says happened, really happened, no more than 15 or 20 percent of what Jesus is purported  to have said, really was said. I don't think that's true. You have your handouts yet? You got something there? Let me give you a quick run through the argument.

Now after I'm done with this, I'm going to take 10 minutes at least. We will take questions up here. You might want to be questioning the left brain, which is me. I think it's the left brain, the rational, or you might be wanting to question the right  brain, which is Bruce over here, the imaginative, and I actually, I have some imagination and  Bruce is quite rational, but at least for tonight, we're representing. You need some more?

We have a few more, yeah. Here we go. If you look at this, let me give you a case. Tonight I am not making a case on this sheet for the authority of the Bible. I'm not trying to say, I'm not saying, here's the argument for why we have to believe  everything the Bible teaches.

I'm sure on here you have a case that the Bible is historically reliable, that the Jesus  that shows you really happened, he really existed. Here's the argument outline, three stages, and then I'll try to break it down. Number one, if you honestly look at what the gospels claim, you will see they're not written  as legends or fiction, they are either historical accounts or a deliberate hoax that's right  on the front versus argument outline. The gospels are not written as legends, they claim to be historical documents, so they  are either deliberate hoaxes or else they are historically reliable documents. Number one, number two, we now know, we did in 50 years ago, that all the gospels were  written within the lifetime, 30 to 60 years after Jesus died, within the lifetime of eyewitnesses.

And since they were written within the lifetime of eyewitnesses, within the lifetime of thousands  who heard in saw Jesus, it's very unlikely they were a hoax. Number three. As long as you don't come with a built in bias against miracles, we conclude that if  you refuse the evidence for the history of the gospels, we have to refuse to admit that  we can know anything about antiquity, for the same rules of historiography used on other  documents show the gospels to be trustworthy as well. That's the case. The Bible tells us that there was a man named Jesus who claimed to be God who did many,  many miracles that people saw.

When he died on the cross, after that he was raised from the dead, at least hundreds  of people saw him raised from the dead. Those are historical facts, and the Bible gives them to us. Now let me just quickly run through what I just mentioned as how do you judge any historical  document? How do you make decisions that any ancient, here's Caesar's Gallic Wars, here's Herodotus  theucidides, all these guys that had written histories. Why do we trust them?

As basically reliable. We're not saying that they're inherent, but it's basically reliable. Why do you trust them? There's several rules, and if you, several tests that you give to historical documents,  and if you give those tests to the Bible, it comes out as a reliable historical document  too. Here are the tests.

Number one, and this one I won't even read through, the bibliographic test. If somebody, pardon me, he's got one. You don't have one. How did you not get one? Did you save one?

The bibliographic test, you can always get more. When it comes to handouts, it's sort of like mana. It'll come down every day, it'll just appear. The bibliographic test, I won't mention unless somebody brings it up later. Some people say, well, we don't have the originals, so how do we know?

The fact is that we don't have the originals, but we have hundreds of documents within  a few decades, hundreds of copies within a few decades of the originals, and so nobody  really denies that we have essentially what originally was written by the gospel writers. If anybody's got a problem with that, I'll go into that. That's number one. Number two, this is important. The genre test.

If you want to know whether historical documents are historical, an ancient document that  is, you have to ask yourself, was it written to be a history? Was it written as a myth? Was it written as an epic? Was it written as a legend? That's very convenient to say the gospels are legends.

People on the street will tell you that all the time. You say, ah, well, the gospels, they're not history, they were myths, they were legends. But the problem is that the gospels in two ways rule that out as a possibility. Number one, the gospels claim to be historical accounts. Now, Bruce didn't do the very, very first part of Luke, but in the very, very beginning  of Luke, we read, Luke says, let's see if I can find it here, in the very beginning  of Luke, you would know it.

Many others, well, yeah, I'm just giving you this section. Actually, that's when I was going back to, ah, you're right, you did say that, I heard  it, but it's how I sat down, you had gone through it. Many others have drawn up accounts of Jesus' life, just as they were handed down to us  by the eyewitnesses. So I have made a careful investigation of everything from the beginning and written in orderly  accounts so that you may know the certainty of these things. You did say that?

But in King James English. Right. Now, Luke, therefore, is telling us that the gospels were written in four stages. Number one, and I have these in here, first of all, they were eyewitnesses who testified  to what they saw. Number two, the eyewitness accounts were handed down.  50 years ago, modern scholarship believed that the gospel accounts were circulated through  oral tradition for years and years and embellished, and therefore it was a kind of whisper  down the valley phenomenon.

You know how you do whisper down the valley? Somebody whispers one person's ear by the time it gets to the end of a string of 10 persons  that comes out different. People change it in the, they hear it wrong and they change it in the transmission. We now know that the way rabbis in Judaism did their teaching was they would give the disciples  an account and make them memorize it rigidly. It was absolutely never done that the disciples who were getting this from the rabbi would  make revisions.

And so we know that the way in which accounts were handed down was through rigid memorization. And so if Luke was getting accounts from eyewitnesses, they would have been handed down for a number  of years, but they certainly wouldn't have been monkeyed with. So he says they were handed down. The number three, he says other accounts had already been written before he wrote. There were earlier gospels, we don't have them, but they'd already been written down.

But then last of all, Luke says that he checked them out. And the way he checked them out would have been the way any kind of writer would have checked  them out. He would have made an early investigation. He probably would have checked written records out that he had to make sure what he wrote  down didn't contradict them. He would have interviewed eyewitnesses that were still around to check out his accounts.

So what Luke is saying is not I wrote a legend. Luke is saying I made every effort to make sure that what I wrote to you, what I am writing,  is an absolutely accurate and historical account. But not only that, the gospel forms do not fit other fictional genres of the time. Even if you didn't have these kinds of claims, the gospel writer of John claimed to be an eyewitness. Luke claimed to use eyewitnesses.

C.S. Lewis, who was a literature, a guy who wrote and was an expert on literature. He taught at Oxford and Cambridge, taught medieval and Renaissance literature. He points out something that boy made a big difference to me. He says, when people say the gospels were fiction, they were myths, they were legends.

He says, you have to remember that when the gospels were written, there was no such thing  as realistic prose fiction. Today we have something called a novel. In a novel, you have realistic fiction. It's written like a historical account. The person went to the door, turned the knob, sweat was dripping from his nose.

You read fiction like that, but not then. See, the fictional forms then, Lewis says, were apocalyptic writing, legend, tragedy,  and parable, and they were not realistic prose. And so Lewis points this out. He says something has to be said about the history of the gospels. I was a professional literary critic.

And I thought I did know the difference between legend and historical writing. That the gospels were certainly not legends, in one sense, they're not good enough. They aren't good enough. Now, Bruce did a pretty good job, but what Lewis is trying to say is if you're really writing  fiction, there's too many little details that are put in there that really have nothing  to do with the plot. He says, if they are not history, they are realistic prose fiction of a kind that actually  never existed before the 18th century.

Little episodes like Jesus writing in the dust when they brought him the woman taken  an adultery, which have no doctrinal significance at all are the mark of it. So what do you see the second point you've got here is either the gospels or total hoaxes  deliberate lies or else they're historical documents, but the one thing you can't say is  well, they're legends. You can't say that. The third historic test of historiography would be the corroboration test. If you have a historical document, the question that comes up is, is there any way to  know that other witnesses, other authorities corroborate the testimony?

And we have a lot of corroboration. We have some historical witnesses we still have, and then we have some witnesses we don't  have. Now, look, the witnesses we still have, here, Tacitus, who was a Roman historian, wrote  in 1815, writes that in 64 AD, Nero punished the Christians, and then he says, Christ  was executed when Tiberius was emperor by the order of the procurator, Pontius Pilate. I was a Samaritan historian named Stalas writing in AD 52, wrote a history of the world  and he included the fact that there was also an eclipse of the sun on the day that Jesus  was crucified, something that the Bible talks about, the darkness. Plenty of the younger, AD 112 mentions Christ and how his followers worshipped him as God.

Josephus was a historian, a Jewish historian, who wrote in AD AD, and recently, some people  question whether Josephus' history has been doctored up by Christians because he says  some strong things about Jesus. However recently we've discovered some very old documents, some copies, there's a 10th  century copy of Josephus written in Arabic that was dug up somewhere in the Near East,  and we're pretty sure that this would have been pretty much the original, and he says this. He says Jesus' disciples reported that he had appeared to them three days after his crucifixion,  and that he was alive. Accordingly he was perhaps the Messiah concerning whom the prophets have recounted wonders. So you put these guys together, and outside of the Gospels you have got corroboration  from other historical authorities that the basic outline of the Gospel account.

Jesus existed, claimed to be God, he did miracles, he was crucified, he was seen by his followers  as physically raised from the dead, that's the basics. But the stronger corroboration is what I may have already mentioned, exerted by European  scholarship, that the Gospels and Acts did not exist before the 3rd century, the 3rd  decade of the 2nd century. It was confidently asserted in the late 1800s and so on by many, many, especially German  European biblical scholars, that you can't trust the Bible historically, because it was  written at least 100 years, the Gospels written at least 100 years later, that the accounts  had been circulating for 100 years, then somebody wrote them down, so who knows whether  they're really accurate. However, in the middle to latter part of this century, both archaeology and other  scholars have proven that the Gospels were all written by 90 AD. Now if you, somebody wants to ask me more questions about that, we can go into it, but a quick  example was back, I think in the 30s or the 40s, they discovered a papyrus, a very small  fragment of the Gospel of John, like three verses, that's all that they found.

But they found it in Alexandria, Egypt, and they carbon dated it 125 AD at the latest. And so they were able to realize if John, which was the last of all the books of the Gospels  written, was in Alexandria by 120 AD, it must have been written by 90 to 100 and therefore  the other Gospels were written all within the lifetime of the eyewitnesses, within the  lifetime of people who saw Jesus and heard His preaching and were there when all the  events happened. Now that, what's interesting is a lot of modern scholars will not admit the implications  of this change, but here's what they are. The essential historical claims of the New Testament, the two in Jesus was empty, authorities  couldn't produce the body, many saw the risen Christ, Jesus claimed to be God, Jesus  did public miracles, such as feeding the 5,000, healings, raising people from the dead,  all that. All of those things were written in public documents.

They were circulating around the Mediterranean, the Gospels or the letters of Paul even,  and they were all written within the lifetime of hundreds of people who were still alive. So for example, when Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 15 that hundreds of people saw the risen  Christ after He was resurrected, and that most of them are alive, and He writes this in  a public document, and Christianity, which was very unpopular as you know, people desperately  wanted to wipe it out. And Christianity was completely based on these historical accounts. Hundreds of people were still around. There is no way in the world, therefore, that these accounts could have been circulating  within the lifetime of eyewitnesses of the Ministry of Jesus Christ unless they were corroborated  by those witnesses.

And you know, there's all sorts of examples you can say, you know, and one example I often  use is that even though it was 30 years ago, it would not be that hard. For example, in 1913, there was the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg. Because when was the Battle of Gettysburg, 1863, 50th anniversary. Do you know how many veterans were still alive, 50 years after that? There were like 20,000 still alive.

It was incredible. They all came together and they talked about things, and could somebody really have written  a book within those 50 years that talked about battles or talked about things that happened,  that hundreds and thousands of the people on the battlefield had seen within the lifetime  of those people. Unless they'd happened, you see? There must have been corroboration within that time frame. The gospel's written too soon after the events.

And so we know that there must have been eyewitnessed corroboration as well. Over the end, we are now at the end. The problem of miracles, now see where we are, bibliographically, we know we have the  originals basically. Number two, the genre, they are historical documents or hoaxes. Number three, it is extremely unlikely they could have been hoaxes.

It's extremely unlikely that they could have been. We see how the corroboration. So are we ready to admit that these documents are showing us what really happened? And if somebody says, it can't be, why? And the answer is, because people say, because there's miracles in there and therefore it  can't be.

Now, if you want to read this next section, and if you want to get into that, I will. But 50 years ago, Newtonian physics reigned in the Western world. And Newtonian physics says there are absolute laws of nature which cannot be violated. Today, it's quantum theory. And quantum theory says all we know are customary ways in which nature operates.

The real problem is this. If you say miracles can't happen, if the only evidence that a miracle would happen is  if somebody wrote an account and said, I saw it and here it is. And if you say miracles can't happen, and you obviate an account of the evidence of  a miracle before you even read it, you're arguing in a circle. You're saying miracles cannot happen. Therefore, miracles have not happened.

And that's arguing in a circle. As long as you're willing not to come with a kind of unscientific, anti-logical, dogmatic  assertion that if there's miracles in this account, it can't be historical. You are to this point. If you get rid of that bias, you have to say, this is telling us in a historically reliable  way that there was a man named Jesus who claimed the things he claimed and did the things he  did. Now, where that brings me is this.

C.S. Lewis years ago said, and he wasn't the first one. He says, there's only four possible ways to explain Jesus. He was either a legend, a liar, a lunatic, or Lord. Now if you hide behind the idea that he was a legend, if you say, we can't know really  what he taught and what he claimed and what he did, then you're able to make up any kind  of Jesus you want, right?

You can say, I think he was a flower child, I think he was a revolutionary. You know, I think he was a great teacher. But if he's not a legend, if the gospel of Luke tells you that they're real Jesus, then  you are stuck. Either he was an absolute charlatan, or he was a complete lunatic, or he is who he said  he was, but there's no other alternative. And the reason I'm a Christian, one of the main reasons is because as crazy as it is  that he actually might be the son of God, it actually makes less sense that either the  other two alternatives would be true.

And so that's where we are. Now I've also attached to your handout, a fairly nine point, I'm sorry, it was nine point  times Roman, it's pretty hard to read, but if somebody wants me to go into it, I will. The Jesus Seminar is a bunch of radical scholars who in spite of historiographical evidence  that the Bible is reliable. They insist that any verse of the Bible is guilty unless it is proven to be true. If you would go at any other ancient historical document, if you would go through Caesar's  Gallic Wars, if you go through any ancient document and say, everything in every page,  I consider untrue unless I find some corroborating witness that proves to me it's true.

If you would do that, we would know nothing about our past at all, but that's how the Jesus  Seminar operates. On that page, I try to show you that if you even take their criteria for deciding which  of Jesus' sayings and deeds are authentic, even with their criteria, you can really show  that the Bible is an accurate, reliable document. If somebody wants me to go into that, we will. Now you may not want to get into any of this stuff. You may not want to ask the left brain anything.

You may want to ask Bruce about something that he said tonight or some of the stories  that accounts that he made, but at this point, I will take questions. You need to say it loud enough so I can repeat it into the mic because I think we are being  taped, and then after that, we will try to answer. So let's get started, first hand. That's a good question. Yeah, but you may not be able to get to them.

Are you going to listen? Yeah, I'll tell you what, would you try asking your question at the mic to see if it works  since you're on the aisle? I don't think we can do that for everybody, though. See if it works. Oh, it does.

Okay, ask the question. Okay. Kind of short. I know. I know.

Pull it around. That way your question is on the tape. Simple question. If we're assuming the New Testament, what you're saying, historical fact, let's assume that  with the miracles, part of the basis of that would be that we have to rely also on the  Old Testament. Would that be correct, based on what you're saying?

Because if I'm assuming you could correct me if I'm wrong, the New Testament, in his  performance of Luke today, is to confirm what was in the Old Testament. Is that correct? Or am I wrong? I just want to know if I'm right or wrong. Well, simple question.

You mean, are you asking what Bruce's intention was or... No, no, you're saying the New Testament. When you say the Bible, do you mean the New Testament and the Old Testament? Or are you just talking about the Gospels? Because I think you've made a very persuasive type of point of showing the New Testament may  be very valid.

Right. But part of the basis of the New Testament is in the Old Testament and just to mention  one thing, if you read Psalm 15, it says, define the Lord, means to walk humble and  do the work of the Lord and it does not mention the Son of Man. So my question is, if we assume the New Testament is right, what you're saying, part of the  basis is the Old Testament, you know, does it fit in and that means Adam and Eve, that  means Noah, that means Abraham, that means Isaac, that means Jacob, are we to you? Do we follow that that also has to be provable like you're doing with this or is it just  a New Testament? No, it's a long question.

Great. Have a seat. Now, if you have a seat, I'll answer that. I don't think that my case for the New Testament documents being reliable proves that the Old  Testament documents are reliable. I don't think so.

Well, now I listen. I'll just be, just because I think I can show you that Luke, John, Matthew, Mark are giving  us reliable eyewitness accounts of what happened, doesn't mean that because they believe  Noah existed, that that means Noah existed, I think all I'm trying to do is give you  a case for the fact that Jesus did live the life and said the things he said. Now, I told you in the beginning though, and maybe you're trying to get at this, I was  not making a case for the authority of the whole Bible tonight, but if I were, here's  how I would do it. I would say, does the New Testament give us historically reliable picture of Jesus? If so, then we have to decide what to do with Jesus.

You have to decide, do I believe what he said he is? Do I submit to him as Lord? Do I receive him as the Son of God? If you do that, the New Testament shows you what any scholar will tell you, and that  is that Jesus believed the Old Testament to be true. So you've got, there's really three steps to the syllogism.

If the Bible is reliable, then Jesus is God, if the New, pardon me, I'm sorry, my syllogism  is all up. If the New Testament is historic or reliable, then I can see that Jesus is God. Now you may not be ready to do that. If you're not ready to do that, then I'm not going to be able to say anything about the  Old Testament. But if you believe that Jesus is who he said he is, then I believe in the authority, the  rest of the Bible, because Jesus treated it with authority.

But my case for the historical liability of the New Testament is really no case for  the historical liability, the Old Testament at all. Now you want to say anything to that, Bruce, you're trying to get at the Old Testament  tonight. He does, you do quote the Old Testament where... I don't know that he quotes it. Yeah.

Jesus doesn't occasionally, in parts that you didn't see tonight, he will quote passages  from Isaiah, and he will say to people, to fellow Jews, this passage has been fulfilled  in your ears, which is like, wait a minute. Are you saying the reason that was written was so that this happens to you? Who are you saying you are? I mean, he did that a lot, and he talked a lot about the old, the prophecies and that  kind of stuff. And some of them are...

Some of them don't work with 20th century reasoning. Some of them are like, you know, some of the things he refers to himself as fulfilling  certain prophecies. You go back and look those up and it's like, wait a minute, are we sure that's talking  about Jesus? It doesn't seem to fit. It doesn't seem to, with our sort of rational...

So we got to be careful about taking our culture and going, aha, this doesn't work this  way because it's, I mean, Old Testament Hebrew culture, very different from Western Greek  thinking even. Yeah. In other words, Jesus did believe that the Old Testament was supernaturally divine, but  you have to believe Jesus... You have to believe in Jesus before I think you can make a case for the divinity of  the Old Testament. I think with just using the facts, you can make a good case for the stark reliability of  the New Testament.

That gets you to Jesus. But you have to get through Jesus to get to the Old Testament, that's what Bruce is saying  there. Okay, Ann, you want to try the mic? Okay. In light of the discussion we're having and in light of the fact that it is said that  there are more Jews in New York City than in Israel.

At the end of the presentation, Bruce was talking about the scriptures where Jesus  himself was explaining that he was the Messiah. Can you recommend a book that would help the people at Redeemer who have Jewish friends  or co-workers to explain that Jesus is the Messiah? You got one, Bruce. I'm sorry, usually I like it when people sit down after they ask the question, but maybe  can you tell them, are you mean you're looking for a book that shows that Jesus fulfills Old  Testament prophecy? Or it's a list of prophecies like Isaiah 53, Isaiah 7, Isaiah 9, Psalm 22, Deuteronomy, especially  Deuteronomy because a Jewish person, especially an orthodox Jewish person, okay, I just wanted  to get the name of it so that people would be aware, especially at this time of year,  you run into these conversations in your office with people.

Well Jesus is the Messiah, but I don't quite know how to explain it to you in your own terms. Okay, I know that Josh McDowell's evidence of the man's a verdict does spend a lot of  time on how Jesus fulfilled Old Testament prophecies. There's a book by John Guest that I can, it's at the office. If you call the office and ask for a book by John Guest that has a, I can give you some  other things too. Anybody, this is dangerous to say this with so many people, but if you, I could give  you a Xerox of a short chapter on how Jesus fulfilled Old Testament prophecies, I know  that if you contacted Jews for Jesus, they would have to have all kinds of documents  about that.

But I think that's what you're looking for. My point is, can we put it on the book table downstairs so that when we, because I have  a lot of Orthodox Jews in my office and they're always talking to me about the Talmud and  how the Torah talks about the Talmud, but I don't quite know how to explain the Jesus fulfilled  all those prophecies. Okay. Good suggestion. That's fine.

Okay. Somebody else. I don't know whether you can get to a mic or not. You got a question? Yeah, I see you.

Why don't you, man, come on down, it would help us because this way it gets on the tape. Sorry to make you do that. Maybe I'm only making, I won't make everybody do that if you don't sitting where you can  get out. Go ahead. I don't know if you've heard of Chuck Colson came up with a conspiracy theory argument.

He tried to refute the conspiracy argument and he used his life in government and he  talked about the benefits of keeping the conspiracy going and the judgment of if the conspiracy  is revealed and also he related that to what he believed the apostles were, how they  were witnessing and what the benefits and judgments of keeping that so called, if there  was a conspiracy going, do you have any, have you read that? Don't leave that mic yet. I have to get this question a little better focused. Okay. Chuck Colson talks about a conspiracy theory about the resurrection, you mean?

No, he attempted to refute what you're talking about is when he said, when he was involved  in Watergate, the top people in the country, the minute self-interest was threatened, the  lie fell apart. Yes. That's the reason he became a Christian was because he looked at what happened and those  people's, the disciples' lies were threatened but they died for what? So this couldn't, this wasn't a normal lie if that's what, is that what, is that what  you're talking about? Yeah.

Yeah, he was, he was there a question about that that? Yes, I was wondering if Tim had had, had, had heard of this and what his thoughts were  on. No, but Bruce had. Okay. I have.

Yes. Thanks. Thank you. Thanks. Somebody else?

Go ahead. Just, just say it and I'll repeat it. Well, would you comment on the Apocrypha, why is the Apocrypha not in the Bible? Tim? Wait, now do you mean the Old Testament Apocrypha or the New Testament Apocrypha?

Yeah, okay. Well, yeah, you're, you know, you're bringing up the whole issue of the canon which is a real  thorny thing and I hadn't heard of the Chuck Holson conspiracy there. By the way, that is a great, that's a great point. Did you all hear that? I'm not sure.

Bruce understood it. He understood it. The point was Chuck Holson knows that when, if you're all working together on a hoax,  when it looks like people are actually, their heads are going to roll for it, it falls apart. People will not stay true to a lie if it means dying for it. And he said what, obviously what Holson was doing is when he read the Bible, it's very  clear that the whole, the resurrection was either an incredible hoax or reality.

And he says when people start dying for the hoax and nobody recants and it doesn't fall  apart, that means it wasn't a hoax, okay? So I wanted you to, so I thought that was, I had not heard that, but it was a wonderful  argument. Now, on the canon, the canon refers to the number of books in the Bible that are received  as divine inspired books of the Bible. The powerful books are books that were written and were never brought into the canon as part  of the Bible. And the way this worked, it wasn't that difficult actually, when the apostles died off and the  last of the apostles died, not long after that, the church decided it was very important  since you didn't have a living canon, that means when somebody would write something  or teach something, as long as you had some of the apostles alive, you always had a  way of checking whether or not the teaching was in line with what Jesus had taught.

But when the apostles died, they realized that they no longer had a living straight edge  for their lives. No, they needed, so they needed to pull together all the books of the Bible, the New Testament,  which were written by an apostle or by an associate of an apostle. So it embodied, either, was apostolic teaching directly or it was apostolic teaching that  was, they were part of the apostolic band, so you have Luke, you know, who wasn't an  apostle or an eyewitness, but he was Paul's associate. And so what you have in Luke, in this sense, was Pauline apostolic teaching. And you have Mark, who though he wasn't an apostle, was Peter's associate, and you have Matthew  and John and on and on and so on.

And what they did was they took the books of the Bible that they understood were written  by an apostle or part of the apostolic band, so they knew the apostolic teaching was there. Any book that purported to be of an apostle, but they decided it was pseudonymous or anonymous,  or as one teacher once said, the pseudonymous, while not necessarily synonymous with anonymous,  is equally post-alonymous. If they felt that a book was not written by an apostle or it didn't represent apostolic  teaching, then they removed it. They said it wasn't, they didn't admit it, I mean. And they were very careful, not only did they check out the pedigree of the books, but  they also checked out whether or not the books had been used by God in the lives of the church,  whether or not the Lord really worked through them.

And they came up with a cannon pretty soon after the death of the last of the eyewitnesses. And that's how they did it. Now, the Old Testament cannon was set before Jesus came along at the Council of Jamnia,  and it was set earlier. And the reason that we accept the Old Testament cannon is because Jesus did. Again, you know, everything we believe about the Old Testament is really based on Jesus.

Jesus quotes from every book of the Old Testament put Esther. He quotes from, and the apostles who were of course his disciples, quote from the canonical  Old Testament that we have today. So basically, Jesus is the reason why apocryl books, both New and Old Testament,  aren't part of the Bible. They had to be written by an apostle or an associate of Jesus,  or in the Old Testament, they had to be one that he subscribed to, and that's the reason. Okay, let's go, Seth.

Seth is saying that there were times in which he was talking with a friend,  a Jewish friend, and making a case that Jesus fulfilled Old Testament prophecies. He'd pull out an Old Testament prophecy from his Bible, and it didn't match the translation  that his friend had in his Bible. And listen, you're not going to overcome that. Here's why, unless you get, well, you can always go to school. I mean, you can always take a graduate course in Hebrew and Old Testament.

It's very normal. If you have, well, I gotta be careful here, it is only natural that the translators  try as they may to be objective, tend to be, you know, when they come out of text,  translation is always to some degree interpretation. Translation is never transliteration. You have to interpret. You try very hard to be objective, but the point is you have a point of view.

And interpreters who really don't believe that Jesus is fulfilling prophecies are very often  going to translate prophecies away, and they're going to use words that take you away. The Jewish movement, the non-Christian Jewish movement, of Christians, you know,  1990 census indicated that 10% of all Jewish people said they believed in Jesus as the Messiah. Did you know that? That's been a big hard thing to swallow for a lot of people. But the non-Christian Jewish movement has a vested interest in making sure that those  passages, which they've had thrown at them for centuries, are not translated anything like the way  the Christian Old Testament is translated.

Now I don't mean to say that it's an out and out, you know, twisting, but I'm just telling you  that's the issue. So what you'd have to do yourself is you'd actually have to get a hold of those  passages and do some checking out. And if he's an Orthodox Jew, he's going to know Hebrew better  than you are. And so when it comes to those passages, I wouldn't argue with him about those. I would find something else to talk to him about.

Okay. No, I would. I mean, in other words, you're not you're not ready for that. So find other ways to talk. That's all.

Yes, sir. Oh, I thought so. Translation here in the East James and New English and the Jerusalem Bible. But they're right in a row and you've been looked from passage to passage to passage. And to answer that question about the Translation.

Yeah. The question is if you compare translations, even though you don't know Hebrew or Greek,  doesn't that help you? And the answer is yes, but it still doesn't completely overcome the problem. I was going to ask Bruce a question. I love the fact that you use the King James.

It was that straight King James, or did you do some some rendering of it yourself? What translation did you use? Thanks, Tim. No, it was mostly King James. There were some passages from John,  from the new new revised standard.

And there are occasional, there are some words, some 15th century words like  yeah, yeah, like that one. And that I don't know the meaning of. And I thought, hmm, I think I'll use a new translation. But there's only like 20 or 30 words in the hour and a half that I've changed. It's mostly King James.

Why did you use, why did you use the King James version? I use the King James version because my boss told me I had to. Who's that? His name is John Jury. He's the artistic director of actor,  theater, Louisville.

This was a regular equity. Actor, theater, Louisville is a major regional theater,  completely non-Christian. Take my word for it. And this was done on Broadway. And like I said in the introduction,  it was his Easter offering.

But do you see the advantages of using the King James? Well, you know, King James was written to be spoken as a pulpit version because so many  people were illiterate. And it's the same thing as Shakespeare. You know, boy, I'm an actor and I've done a fair amount of Shakespeare. And it's difficult to read because it was written to be spoken and to be.

And these, actually, if you think about it, these were eyewitness accounts. So originally, Luke, the historian, got these as spoken testimony, probably. And he probably had other sources. But eyewitness accounts. So originally, people were telling these to people.

And you can imagine the guy who said, I came into a city called Maine. And Jesus was in a lot of his disciples. His dead body was being taken out. Jesus said a couple of words of the dead body. It sat up.

It started talking. He delivered him onto his mother and there came a fear upon. You can imagine the way Jesus, the way that original eyewitness told that to Luke, was not,  it came to pass in those days that he came off onto the city of Maine. You know, it's been badly read in church for 300 years. And people,  I did it.

There was a student doing a review of the show down in Florida. And he said, I want to I want to show you what I wrote, Bruce. And he said, Bruce Cune takes otherwise boring material. And it's like, wait a minute. This is not boring material.

I mean, withered hands become whole. This is dead bodies. This is, right. It's been made maybe a little too sacred. And it is that.

But yes, I'm going to take a couple more questions, but I want you know,  I loved him using the King James. First of all, it is gorgeous. But secondly,  the King James really probably makes more sense when it's early interpreted. Not just red, but I mean, early interpreted. It made so much more sense in the way I, the way it makes the way it looks when you actually  read it to yourself.

I just absolutely loved it. Now I can take a couple more questions. And it is the way Jesus himself spoke. Right. As somebody once said about the King James Bible, if it was good enough for St.

Paul,  it was good enough for me. That's right. Yeah, go ahead. I'm going to take a couple more. We have to be done by 8.15.

So if you can stay around for 10 more minutes, I'll, I'm sending everybody away by then. Yes, go ahead. For the tape, someone just complimented Bruce Cune. Said it was a fantastic performance just so just for the record now. And I'm going to make my questions with those three statements that I have to make.

And I'll give you the question up front. How truthful is Jesus existence? That's where I'll line up with the following statement. How truthful is Jesus existence? Okay.

Why are the books of the New Testament different in four men from the books of the Old Testament? And if we can both believe that God wrote the Old Testament through Moses,  then why would he have changed his four men in the Old Testament? Therefore, I can see that Jesus existence. Okay. The question is, the New Testament is written in very different form than the Old Testament.

If God wrote the Old and the New Testament, why would it be so different? Okay. And the answer is, Jesus, just as Jesus was fully human and fully divine,  He wasn't half human, half divine, He was 100 percent, 100 percent. The Bible is not only divine book, it's a human book. It's not only human book, it's a divine book.

To say it's really human, that the people who wrote it were writing it consciously. They were using their own personalities and their own cultural forms to write it. Does not compromise the fact that it was all, everything that was written was written by God,  and every word was the word that God wanted to be written. So you can put those two things together. To say that since God wrote the whole Bible, the same literary form or personality would be evident  throughout, isn't right.

The themes are there. The truth all coheres. But the fact is that, for example, Luke says to his, the person he's writing to, theophilus,  he says, I wrote this account because I thought it would be good. Luke did not, here's what I'm trying to say, Luke did not one day was sitting, you know,  just to have all of a sudden his hands started to move. He says, I'm, and he picked up a pen, and he says, my gosh, what's going on here?

And he all became an, you know, it was an automatic writing. His personality, his foibles even, his, his culture was all reflected. And that's the reason why you have such that you have, he brews the Greek of Hebrews is so lofty  and the Greek of John is almost like talking to a little kid. And because the, that's what's so wonderful about the Bible, it is an absolutely human book. And yet, it is absolutely thoroughly divine.

So it's not the, it's not the form, but the content and the coherence that shows it's divine, but not the form.

### English Transcript (for reference)

Today puts a front page article about it. What they do is they go through the Bible and they color code the Bible, biblical verses. What they'll do is they'll give red, if they say Jesus probably said this, it probably  really happened. They give pink if it might be true. They give gray if it's probably not true and they give black if it's not true at all.

And generally, the Jesus Seminar says no more than 15 to 20 percent of what the Bible actually  says happened, really happened, no more than 15 or 20 percent of what Jesus is purported  to have said, really was said. I don't think that's true. You have your handouts yet? You got something there? Let me give you a quick run through the argument.

Now after I'm done with this, I'm going to take 10 minutes at least. We will take questions up here. You might want to be questioning the left brain, which is me. I think it's the left brain, the rational, or you might be wanting to question the right  brain, which is Bruce over here, the imaginative, and I actually, I have some imagination and  Bruce is quite rational, but at least for tonight, we're representing. You need some more?

We have a few more, yeah. Here we go. If you look at this, let me give you a case. Tonight I am not making a case on this sheet for the authority of the Bible. I'm not trying to say, I'm not saying, here's the argument for why we have to believe  everything the Bible teaches.

I'm sure on here you have a case that the Bible is historically reliable, that the Jesus  that shows you really happened, he really existed. Here's the argument outline, three stages, and then I'll try to break it down. Number one, if you honestly look at what the gospels claim, you will see they're not written  as legends or fiction, they are either historical accounts or a deliberate hoax that's right  on the front versus argument outline. The gospels are not written as legends, they claim to be historical documents, so they  are either deliberate hoaxes or else they are historically reliable documents. Number one, number two, we now know, we did in 50 years ago, that all the gospels were  written within the lifetime, 30 to 60 years after Jesus died, within the lifetime of eyewitnesses.

And since they were written within the lifetime of eyewitnesses, within the lifetime of thousands  who heard in saw Jesus, it's very unlikely they were a hoax. Number three. As long as you don't come with a built in bias against miracles, we conclude that if  you refuse the evidence for the history of the gospels, we have to refuse to admit that  we can know anything about antiquity, for the same rules of historiography used on other  documents show the gospels to be trustworthy as well. That's the case. The Bible tells us that there was a man named Jesus who claimed to be God who did many,  many miracles that people saw.

When he died on the cross, after that he was raised from the dead, at least hundreds  of people saw him raised from the dead. Those are historical facts, and the Bible gives them to us. Now let me just quickly run through what I just mentioned as how do you judge any historical  document? How do you make decisions that any ancient, here's Caesar's Gallic Wars, here's Herodotus  theucidides, all these guys that had written histories. Why do we trust them?

As basically reliable. We're not saying that they're inherent, but it's basically reliable. Why do you trust them? There's several rules, and if you, several tests that you give to historical documents,  and if you give those tests to the Bible, it comes out as a reliable historical document  too. Here are the tests.

Number one, and this one I won't even read through, the bibliographic test. If somebody, pardon me, he's got one. You don't have one. How did you not get one? Did you save one?

The bibliographic test, you can always get more. When it comes to handouts, it's sort of like mana. It'll come down every day, it'll just appear. The bibliographic test, I won't mention unless somebody brings it up later. Some people say, well, we don't have the originals, so how do we know?

The fact is that we don't have the originals, but we have hundreds of documents within  a few decades, hundreds of copies within a few decades of the originals, and so nobody  really denies that we have essentially what originally was written by the gospel writers. If anybody's got a problem with that, I'll go into that. That's number one. Number two, this is important. The genre test.

If you want to know whether historical documents are historical, an ancient document that  is, you have to ask yourself, was it written to be a history? Was it written as a myth? Was it written as an epic? Was it written as a legend? That's very convenient to say the gospels are legends.

People on the street will tell you that all the time. You say, ah, well, the gospels, they're not history, they were myths, they were legends. But the problem is that the gospels in two ways rule that out as a possibility. Number one, the gospels claim to be historical accounts. Now, Bruce didn't do the very, very first part of Luke, but in the very, very beginning  of Luke, we read, Luke says, let's see if I can find it here, in the very beginning  of Luke, you would know it.

Many others, well, yeah, I'm just giving you this section. Actually, that's when I was going back to, ah, you're right, you did say that, I heard  it, but it's how I sat down, you had gone through it. Many others have drawn up accounts of Jesus' life, just as they were handed down to us  by the eyewitnesses. So I have made a careful investigation of everything from the beginning and written in orderly  accounts so that you may know the certainty of these things. You did say that?

But in King James English. Right. Now, Luke, therefore, is telling us that the gospels were written in four stages. Number one, and I have these in here, first of all, they were eyewitnesses who testified  to what they saw. Number two, the eyewitness accounts were handed down.  50 years ago, modern scholarship believed that the gospel accounts were circulated through  oral tradition for years and years and embellished, and therefore it was a kind of whisper  down the valley phenomenon.

You know how you do whisper down the valley? Somebody whispers one person's ear by the time it gets to the end of a string of 10 persons  that comes out different. People change it in the, they hear it wrong and they change it in the transmission. We now know that the way rabbis in Judaism did their teaching was they would give the disciples  an account and make them memorize it rigidly. It was absolutely never done that the disciples who were getting this from the rabbi would  make revisions.

And so we know that the way in which accounts were handed down was through rigid memorization. And so if Luke was getting accounts from eyewitnesses, they would have been handed down for a number  of years, but they certainly wouldn't have been monkeyed with. So he says they were handed down. The number three, he says other accounts had already been written before he wrote. There were earlier gospels, we don't have them, but they'd already been written down.

But then last of all, Luke says that he checked them out. And the way he checked them out would have been the way any kind of writer would have checked  them out. He would have made an early investigation. He probably would have checked written records out that he had to make sure what he wrote  down didn't contradict them. He would have interviewed eyewitnesses that were still around to check out his accounts.

So what Luke is saying is not I wrote a legend. Luke is saying I made every effort to make sure that what I wrote to you, what I am writing,  is an absolutely accurate and historical account. But not only that, the gospel forms do not fit other fictional genres of the time. Even if you didn't have these kinds of claims, the gospel writer of John claimed to be an eyewitness. Luke claimed to use eyewitnesses.

C.S. Lewis, who was a literature, a guy who wrote and was an expert on literature. He taught at Oxford and Cambridge, taught medieval and Renaissance literature. He points out something that boy made a big difference to me. He says, when people say the gospels were fiction, they were myths, they were legends.

He says, you have to remember that when the gospels were written, there was no such thing  as realistic prose fiction. Today we have something called a novel. In a novel, you have realistic fiction. It's written like a historical account. The person went to the door, turned the knob, sweat was dripping from his nose.

You read fiction like that, but not then. See, the fictional forms then, Lewis says, were apocalyptic writing, legend, tragedy,  and parable, and they were not realistic prose. And so Lewis points this out. He says something has to be said about the history of the gospels. I was a professional literary critic.

And I thought I did know the difference between legend and historical writing. That the gospels were certainly not legends, in one sense, they're not good enough. They aren't good enough. Now, Bruce did a pretty good job, but what Lewis is trying to say is if you're really writing  fiction, there's too many little details that are put in there that really have nothing  to do with the plot. He says, if they are not history, they are realistic prose fiction of a kind that actually  never existed before the 18th century.

Little episodes like Jesus writing in the dust when they brought him the woman taken  an adultery, which have no doctrinal significance at all are the mark of it. So what do you see the second point you've got here is either the gospels or total hoaxes  deliberate lies or else they're historical documents, but the one thing you can't say is  well, they're legends. You can't say that. The third historic test of historiography would be the corroboration test. If you have a historical document, the question that comes up is, is there any way to  know that other witnesses, other authorities corroborate the testimony?

And we have a lot of corroboration. We have some historical witnesses we still have, and then we have some witnesses we don't  have. Now, look, the witnesses we still have, here, Tacitus, who was a Roman historian, wrote  in 1815, writes that in 64 AD, Nero punished the Christians, and then he says, Christ  was executed when Tiberius was emperor by the order of the procurator, Pontius Pilate. I was a Samaritan historian named Stalas writing in AD 52, wrote a history of the world  and he included the fact that there was also an eclipse of the sun on the day that Jesus  was crucified, something that the Bible talks about, the darkness. Plenty of the younger, AD 112 mentions Christ and how his followers worshipped him as God.

Josephus was a historian, a Jewish historian, who wrote in AD AD, and recently, some people  question whether Josephus' history has been doctored up by Christians because he says  some strong things about Jesus. However recently we've discovered some very old documents, some copies, there's a 10th  century copy of Josephus written in Arabic that was dug up somewhere in the Near East,  and we're pretty sure that this would have been pretty much the original, and he says this. He says Jesus' disciples reported that he had appeared to them three days after his crucifixion,  and that he was alive. Accordingly he was perhaps the Messiah concerning whom the prophets have recounted wonders. So you put these guys together, and outside of the Gospels you have got corroboration  from other historical authorities that the basic outline of the Gospel account.

Jesus existed, claimed to be God, he did miracles, he was crucified, he was seen by his followers  as physically raised from the dead, that's the basics. But the stronger corroboration is what I may have already mentioned, exerted by European  scholarship, that the Gospels and Acts did not exist before the 3rd century, the 3rd  decade of the 2nd century. It was confidently asserted in the late 1800s and so on by many, many, especially German  European biblical scholars, that you can't trust the Bible historically, because it was  written at least 100 years, the Gospels written at least 100 years later, that the accounts  had been circulating for 100 years, then somebody wrote them down, so who knows whether  they're really accurate. However, in the middle to latter part of this century, both archaeology and other  scholars have proven that the Gospels were all written by 90 AD. Now if you, somebody wants to ask me more questions about that, we can go into it, but a quick  example was back, I think in the 30s or the 40s, they discovered a papyrus, a very small  fragment of the Gospel of John, like three verses, that's all that they found.

But they found it in Alexandria, Egypt, and they carbon dated it 125 AD at the latest. And so they were able to realize if John, which was the last of all the books of the Gospels  written, was in Alexandria by 120 AD, it must have been written by 90 to 100 and therefore  the other Gospels were written all within the lifetime of the eyewitnesses, within the  lifetime of people who saw Jesus and heard His preaching and were there when all the  events happened. Now that, what's interesting is a lot of modern scholars will not admit the implications  of this change, but here's what they are. The essential historical claims of the New Testament, the two in Jesus was empty, authorities  couldn't produce the body, many saw the risen Christ, Jesus claimed to be God, Jesus  did public miracles, such as feeding the 5,000, healings, raising people from the dead,  all that. All of those things were written in public documents.

They were circulating around the Mediterranean, the Gospels or the letters of Paul even,  and they were all written within the lifetime of hundreds of people who were still alive. So for example, when Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 15 that hundreds of people saw the risen  Christ after He was resurrected, and that most of them are alive, and He writes this in  a public document, and Christianity, which was very unpopular as you know, people desperately  wanted to wipe it out. And Christianity was completely based on these historical accounts. Hundreds of people were still around. There is no way in the world, therefore, that these accounts could have been circulating  within the lifetime of eyewitnesses of the Ministry of Jesus Christ unless they were corroborated  by those witnesses.

And you know, there's all sorts of examples you can say, you know, and one example I often  use is that even though it was 30 years ago, it would not be that hard. For example, in 1913, there was the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg. Because when was the Battle of Gettysburg, 1863, 50th anniversary. Do you know how many veterans were still alive, 50 years after that? There were like 20,000 still alive.

It was incredible. They all came together and they talked about things, and could somebody really have written  a book within those 50 years that talked about battles or talked about things that happened,  that hundreds and thousands of the people on the battlefield had seen within the lifetime  of those people. Unless they'd happened, you see? There must have been corroboration within that time frame. The gospel's written too soon after the events.

And so we know that there must have been eyewitnessed corroboration as well. Over the end, we are now at the end. The problem of miracles, now see where we are, bibliographically, we know we have the  originals basically. Number two, the genre, they are historical documents or hoaxes. Number three, it is extremely unlikely they could have been hoaxes.

It's extremely unlikely that they could have been. We see how the corroboration. So are we ready to admit that these documents are showing us what really happened? And if somebody says, it can't be, why? And the answer is, because people say, because there's miracles in there and therefore it  can't be.

Now, if you want to read this next section, and if you want to get into that, I will. But 50 years ago, Newtonian physics reigned in the Western world. And Newtonian physics says there are absolute laws of nature which cannot be violated. Today, it's quantum theory. And quantum theory says all we know are customary ways in which nature operates.

The real problem is this. If you say miracles can't happen, if the only evidence that a miracle would happen is  if somebody wrote an account and said, I saw it and here it is. And if you say miracles can't happen, and you obviate an account of the evidence of  a miracle before you even read it, you're arguing in a circle. You're saying miracles cannot happen. Therefore, miracles have not happened.

And that's arguing in a circle. As long as you're willing not to come with a kind of unscientific, anti-logical, dogmatic  assertion that if there's miracles in this account, it can't be historical. You are to this point. If you get rid of that bias, you have to say, this is telling us in a historically reliable  way that there was a man named Jesus who claimed the things he claimed and did the things he  did. Now, where that brings me is this.

C.S. Lewis years ago said, and he wasn't the first one. He says, there's only four possible ways to explain Jesus. He was either a legend, a liar, a lunatic, or Lord. Now if you hide behind the idea that he was a legend, if you say, we can't know really  what he taught and what he claimed and what he did, then you're able to make up any kind  of Jesus you want, right?

You can say, I think he was a flower child, I think he was a revolutionary. You know, I think he was a great teacher. But if he's not a legend, if the gospel of Luke tells you that they're real Jesus, then  you are stuck. Either he was an absolute charlatan, or he was a complete lunatic, or he is who he said  he was, but there's no other alternative. And the reason I'm a Christian, one of the main reasons is because as crazy as it is  that he actually might be the son of God, it actually makes less sense that either the  other two alternatives would be true.

And so that's where we are. Now I've also attached to your handout, a fairly nine point, I'm sorry, it was nine point  times Roman, it's pretty hard to read, but if somebody wants me to go into it, I will. The Jesus Seminar is a bunch of radical scholars who in spite of historiographical evidence  that the Bible is reliable. They insist that any verse of the Bible is guilty unless it is proven to be true. If you would go at any other ancient historical document, if you would go through Caesar's  Gallic Wars, if you go through any ancient document and say, everything in every page,  I consider untrue unless I find some corroborating witness that proves to me it's true.

If you would do that, we would know nothing about our past at all, but that's how the Jesus  Seminar operates. On that page, I try to show you that if you even take their criteria for deciding which  of Jesus' sayings and deeds are authentic, even with their criteria, you can really show  that the Bible is an accurate, reliable document. If somebody wants me to go into that, we will. Now you may not want to get into any of this stuff. You may not want to ask the left brain anything.

You may want to ask Bruce about something that he said tonight or some of the stories  that accounts that he made, but at this point, I will take questions. You need to say it loud enough so I can repeat it into the mic because I think we are being  taped, and then after that, we will try to answer. So let's get started, first hand. That's a good question. Yeah, but you may not be able to get to them.

Are you going to listen? Yeah, I'll tell you what, would you try asking your question at the mic to see if it works  since you're on the aisle? I don't think we can do that for everybody, though. See if it works. Oh, it does.

Okay, ask the question. Okay. Kind of short. I know. I know.

Pull it around. That way your question is on the tape. Simple question. If we're assuming the New Testament, what you're saying, historical fact, let's assume that  with the miracles, part of the basis of that would be that we have to rely also on the  Old Testament. Would that be correct, based on what you're saying?

Because if I'm assuming you could correct me if I'm wrong, the New Testament, in his  performance of Luke today, is to confirm what was in the Old Testament. Is that correct? Or am I wrong? I just want to know if I'm right or wrong. Well, simple question.

You mean, are you asking what Bruce's intention was or... No, no, you're saying the New Testament. When you say the Bible, do you mean the New Testament and the Old Testament? Or are you just talking about the Gospels? Because I think you've made a very persuasive type of point of showing the New Testament may  be very valid.

Right. But part of the basis of the New Testament is in the Old Testament and just to mention  one thing, if you read Psalm 15, it says, define the Lord, means to walk humble and  do the work of the Lord and it does not mention the Son of Man. So my question is, if we assume the New Testament is right, what you're saying, part of the  basis is the Old Testament, you know, does it fit in and that means Adam and Eve, that  means Noah, that means Abraham, that means Isaac, that means Jacob, are we to you? Do we follow that that also has to be provable like you're doing with this or is it just  a New Testament? No, it's a long question.

Great. Have a seat. Now, if you have a seat, I'll answer that. I don't think that my case for the New Testament documents being reliable proves that the Old  Testament documents are reliable. I don't think so.

Well, now I listen. I'll just be, just because I think I can show you that Luke, John, Matthew, Mark are giving  us reliable eyewitness accounts of what happened, doesn't mean that because they believe  Noah existed, that that means Noah existed, I think all I'm trying to do is give you  a case for the fact that Jesus did live the life and said the things he said. Now, I told you in the beginning though, and maybe you're trying to get at this, I was  not making a case for the authority of the whole Bible tonight, but if I were, here's  how I would do it. I would say, does the New Testament give us historically reliable picture of Jesus? If so, then we have to decide what to do with Jesus.

You have to decide, do I believe what he said he is? Do I submit to him as Lord? Do I receive him as the Son of God? If you do that, the New Testament shows you what any scholar will tell you, and that  is that Jesus believed the Old Testament to be true. So you've got, there's really three steps to the syllogism.

If the Bible is reliable, then Jesus is God, if the New, pardon me, I'm sorry, my syllogism  is all up. If the New Testament is historic or reliable, then I can see that Jesus is God. Now you may not be ready to do that. If you're not ready to do that, then I'm not going to be able to say anything about the  Old Testament. But if you believe that Jesus is who he said he is, then I believe in the authority, the  rest of the Bible, because Jesus treated it with authority.

But my case for the historical liability of the New Testament is really no case for  the historical liability, the Old Testament at all. Now you want to say anything to that, Bruce, you're trying to get at the Old Testament  tonight. He does, you do quote the Old Testament where... I don't know that he quotes it. Yeah.

Jesus doesn't occasionally, in parts that you didn't see tonight, he will quote passages  from Isaiah, and he will say to people, to fellow Jews, this passage has been fulfilled  in your ears, which is like, wait a minute. Are you saying the reason that was written was so that this happens to you? Who are you saying you are? I mean, he did that a lot, and he talked a lot about the old, the prophecies and that  kind of stuff. And some of them are...

Some of them don't work with 20th century reasoning. Some of them are like, you know, some of the things he refers to himself as fulfilling  certain prophecies. You go back and look those up and it's like, wait a minute, are we sure that's talking  about Jesus? It doesn't seem to fit. It doesn't seem to, with our sort of rational...

So we got to be careful about taking our culture and going, aha, this doesn't work this  way because it's, I mean, Old Testament Hebrew culture, very different from Western Greek  thinking even. Yeah. In other words, Jesus did believe that the Old Testament was supernaturally divine, but  you have to believe Jesus... You have to believe in Jesus before I think you can make a case for the divinity of  the Old Testament. I think with just using the facts, you can make a good case for the stark reliability of  the New Testament.

That gets you to Jesus. But you have to get through Jesus to get to the Old Testament, that's what Bruce is saying  there. Okay, Ann, you want to try the mic? Okay. In light of the discussion we're having and in light of the fact that it is said that  there are more Jews in New York City than in Israel.

At the end of the presentation, Bruce was talking about the scriptures where Jesus  himself was explaining that he was the Messiah. Can you recommend a book that would help the people at Redeemer who have Jewish friends  or co-workers to explain that Jesus is the Messiah? You got one, Bruce. I'm sorry, usually I like it when people sit down after they ask the question, but maybe  can you tell them, are you mean you're looking for a book that shows that Jesus fulfills Old  Testament prophecy? Or it's a list of prophecies like Isaiah 53, Isaiah 7, Isaiah 9, Psalm 22, Deuteronomy, especially  Deuteronomy because a Jewish person, especially an orthodox Jewish person, okay, I just wanted  to get the name of it so that people would be aware, especially at this time of year,  you run into these conversations in your office with people.

Well Jesus is the Messiah, but I don't quite know how to explain it to you in your own terms. Okay, I know that Josh McDowell's evidence of the man's a verdict does spend a lot of  time on how Jesus fulfilled Old Testament prophecies. There's a book by John Guest that I can, it's at the office. If you call the office and ask for a book by John Guest that has a, I can give you some  other things too. Anybody, this is dangerous to say this with so many people, but if you, I could give  you a Xerox of a short chapter on how Jesus fulfilled Old Testament prophecies, I know  that if you contacted Jews for Jesus, they would have to have all kinds of documents  about that.

But I think that's what you're looking for. My point is, can we put it on the book table downstairs so that when we, because I have  a lot of Orthodox Jews in my office and they're always talking to me about the Talmud and  how the Torah talks about the Talmud, but I don't quite know how to explain the Jesus fulfilled  all those prophecies. Okay. Good suggestion. That's fine.

Okay. Somebody else. I don't know whether you can get to a mic or not. You got a question? Yeah, I see you.

Why don't you, man, come on down, it would help us because this way it gets on the tape. Sorry to make you do that. Maybe I'm only making, I won't make everybody do that if you don't sitting where you can  get out. Go ahead. I don't know if you've heard of Chuck Colson came up with a conspiracy theory argument.

He tried to refute the conspiracy argument and he used his life in government and he  talked about the benefits of keeping the conspiracy going and the judgment of if the conspiracy  is revealed and also he related that to what he believed the apostles were, how they  were witnessing and what the benefits and judgments of keeping that so called, if there  was a conspiracy going, do you have any, have you read that? Don't leave that mic yet. I have to get this question a little better focused. Okay. Chuck Colson talks about a conspiracy theory about the resurrection, you mean?

No, he attempted to refute what you're talking about is when he said, when he was involved  in Watergate, the top people in the country, the minute self-interest was threatened, the  lie fell apart. Yes. That's the reason he became a Christian was because he looked at what happened and those  people's, the disciples' lies were threatened but they died for what? So this couldn't, this wasn't a normal lie if that's what, is that what, is that what  you're talking about? Yeah.

Yeah, he was, he was there a question about that that? Yes, I was wondering if Tim had had, had, had heard of this and what his thoughts were  on. No, but Bruce had. Okay. I have.

Yes. Thanks. Thank you. Thanks. Somebody else?

Go ahead. Just, just say it and I'll repeat it. Well, would you comment on the Apocrypha, why is the Apocrypha not in the Bible? Tim? Wait, now do you mean the Old Testament Apocrypha or the New Testament Apocrypha?

Yeah, okay. Well, yeah, you're, you know, you're bringing up the whole issue of the canon which is a real  thorny thing and I hadn't heard of the Chuck Holson conspiracy there. By the way, that is a great, that's a great point. Did you all hear that? I'm not sure.

Bruce understood it. He understood it. The point was Chuck Holson knows that when, if you're all working together on a hoax,  when it looks like people are actually, their heads are going to roll for it, it falls apart. People will not stay true to a lie if it means dying for it. And he said what, obviously what Holson was doing is when he read the Bible, it's very  clear that the whole, the resurrection was either an incredible hoax or reality.

And he says when people start dying for the hoax and nobody recants and it doesn't fall  apart, that means it wasn't a hoax, okay? So I wanted you to, so I thought that was, I had not heard that, but it was a wonderful  argument. Now, on the canon, the canon refers to the number of books in the Bible that are received  as divine inspired books of the Bible. The powerful books are books that were written and were never brought into the canon as part  of the Bible. And the way this worked, it wasn't that difficult actually, when the apostles died off and the  last of the apostles died, not long after that, the church decided it was very important  since you didn't have a living canon, that means when somebody would write something  or teach something, as long as you had some of the apostles alive, you always had a  way of checking whether or not the teaching was in line with what Jesus had taught.

But when the apostles died, they realized that they no longer had a living straight edge  for their lives. No, they needed, so they needed to pull together all the books of the Bible, the New Testament,  which were written by an apostle or by an associate of an apostle. So it embodied, either, was apostolic teaching directly or it was apostolic teaching that  was, they were part of the apostolic band, so you have Luke, you know, who wasn't an  apostle or an eyewitness, but he was Paul's associate. And so what you have in Luke, in this sense, was Pauline apostolic teaching. And you have Mark, who though he wasn't an apostle, was Peter's associate, and you have Matthew  and John and on and on and so on.

And what they did was they took the books of the Bible that they understood were written  by an apostle or part of the apostolic band, so they knew the apostolic teaching was there. Any book that purported to be of an apostle, but they decided it was pseudonymous or anonymous,  or as one teacher once said, the pseudonymous, while not necessarily synonymous with anonymous,  is equally post-alonymous. If they felt that a book was not written by an apostle or it didn't represent apostolic  teaching, then they removed it. They said it wasn't, they didn't admit it, I mean. And they were very careful, not only did they check out the pedigree of the books, but  they also checked out whether or not the books had been used by God in the lives of the church,  whether or not the Lord really worked through them.

And they came up with a cannon pretty soon after the death of the last of the eyewitnesses. And that's how they did it. Now, the Old Testament cannon was set before Jesus came along at the Council of Jamnia,  and it was set earlier. And the reason that we accept the Old Testament cannon is because Jesus did. Again, you know, everything we believe about the Old Testament is really based on Jesus.

Jesus quotes from every book of the Old Testament put Esther. He quotes from, and the apostles who were of course his disciples, quote from the canonical  Old Testament that we have today. So basically, Jesus is the reason why apocryl books, both New and Old Testament,  aren't part of the Bible. They had to be written by an apostle or an associate of Jesus,  or in the Old Testament, they had to be one that he subscribed to, and that's the reason. Okay, let's go, Seth.

Seth is saying that there were times in which he was talking with a friend,  a Jewish friend, and making a case that Jesus fulfilled Old Testament prophecies. He'd pull out an Old Testament prophecy from his Bible, and it didn't match the translation  that his friend had in his Bible. And listen, you're not going to overcome that. Here's why, unless you get, well, you can always go to school. I mean, you can always take a graduate course in Hebrew and Old Testament.

It's very normal. If you have, well, I gotta be careful here, it is only natural that the translators  try as they may to be objective, tend to be, you know, when they come out of text,  translation is always to some degree interpretation. Translation is never transliteration. You have to interpret. You try very hard to be objective, but the point is you have a point of view.

And interpreters who really don't believe that Jesus is fulfilling prophecies are very often  going to translate prophecies away, and they're going to use words that take you away. The Jewish movement, the non-Christian Jewish movement, of Christians, you know,  1990 census indicated that 10% of all Jewish people said they believed in Jesus as the Messiah. Did you know that? That's been a big hard thing to swallow for a lot of people. But the non-Christian Jewish movement has a vested interest in making sure that those  passages, which they've had thrown at them for centuries, are not translated anything like the way  the Christian Old Testament is translated.

Now I don't mean to say that it's an out and out, you know, twisting, but I'm just telling you  that's the issue. So what you'd have to do yourself is you'd actually have to get a hold of those  passages and do some checking out. And if he's an Orthodox Jew, he's going to know Hebrew better  than you are. And so when it comes to those passages, I wouldn't argue with him about those. I would find something else to talk to him about.

Okay. No, I would. I mean, in other words, you're not you're not ready for that. So find other ways to talk. That's all.

Yes, sir. Oh, I thought so. Translation here in the East James and New English and the Jerusalem Bible. But they're right in a row and you've been looked from passage to passage to passage. And to answer that question about the Translation.

Yeah. The question is if you compare translations, even though you don't know Hebrew or Greek,  doesn't that help you? And the answer is yes, but it still doesn't completely overcome the problem. I was going to ask Bruce a question. I love the fact that you use the King James.

It was that straight King James, or did you do some some rendering of it yourself? What translation did you use? Thanks, Tim. No, it was mostly King James. There were some passages from John,  from the new new revised standard.

And there are occasional, there are some words, some 15th century words like  yeah, yeah, like that one. And that I don't know the meaning of. And I thought, hmm, I think I'll use a new translation. But there's only like 20 or 30 words in the hour and a half that I've changed. It's mostly King James.

Why did you use, why did you use the King James version? I use the King James version because my boss told me I had to. Who's that? His name is John Jury. He's the artistic director of actor,  theater, Louisville.

This was a regular equity. Actor, theater, Louisville is a major regional theater,  completely non-Christian. Take my word for it. And this was done on Broadway. And like I said in the introduction,  it was his Easter offering.

But do you see the advantages of using the King James? Well, you know, King James was written to be spoken as a pulpit version because so many  people were illiterate. And it's the same thing as Shakespeare. You know, boy, I'm an actor and I've done a fair amount of Shakespeare. And it's difficult to read because it was written to be spoken and to be.

And these, actually, if you think about it, these were eyewitness accounts. So originally, Luke, the historian, got these as spoken testimony, probably. And he probably had other sources. But eyewitness accounts. So originally, people were telling these to people.

And you can imagine the guy who said, I came into a city called Maine. And Jesus was in a lot of his disciples. His dead body was being taken out. Jesus said a couple of words of the dead body. It sat up.

It started talking. He delivered him onto his mother and there came a fear upon. You can imagine the way Jesus, the way that original eyewitness told that to Luke, was not,  it came to pass in those days that he came off onto the city of Maine. You know, it's been badly read in church for 300 years. And people,  I did it.

There was a student doing a review of the show down in Florida. And he said, I want to I want to show you what I wrote, Bruce. And he said, Bruce Cune takes otherwise boring material. And it's like, wait a minute. This is not boring material.

I mean, withered hands become whole. This is dead bodies. This is, right. It's been made maybe a little too sacred. And it is that.

But yes, I'm going to take a couple more questions, but I want you know,  I loved him using the King James. First of all, it is gorgeous. But secondly,  the King James really probably makes more sense when it's early interpreted. Not just red, but I mean, early interpreted. It made so much more sense in the way I, the way it makes the way it looks when you actually  read it to yourself.

I just absolutely loved it. Now I can take a couple more questions. And it is the way Jesus himself spoke. Right. As somebody once said about the King James Bible, if it was good enough for St.

Paul,  it was good enough for me. That's right. Yeah, go ahead. I'm going to take a couple more. We have to be done by 8.15.

So if you can stay around for 10 more minutes, I'll, I'm sending everybody away by then. Yes, go ahead. For the tape, someone just complimented Bruce Cune. Said it was a fantastic performance just so just for the record now. And I'm going to make my questions with those three statements that I have to make.

And I'll give you the question up front. How truthful is Jesus existence? That's where I'll line up with the following statement. How truthful is Jesus existence? Okay.

Why are the books of the New Testament different in four men from the books of the Old Testament? And if we can both believe that God wrote the Old Testament through Moses,  then why would he have changed his four men in the Old Testament? Therefore, I can see that Jesus existence. Okay. The question is, the New Testament is written in very different form than the Old Testament.

If God wrote the Old and the New Testament, why would it be so different? Okay. And the answer is, Jesus, just as Jesus was fully human and fully divine,  He wasn't half human, half divine, He was 100 percent, 100 percent. The Bible is not only divine book, it's a human book. It's not only human book, it's a divine book.

To say it's really human, that the people who wrote it were writing it consciously. They were using their own personalities and their own cultural forms to write it. Does not compromise the fact that it was all, everything that was written was written by God,  and every word was the word that God wanted to be written. So you can put those two things together. To say that since God wrote the whole Bible, the same literary form or personality would be evident  throughout, isn't right.

The themes are there. The truth all coheres. But the fact is that, for example, Luke says to his, the person he's writing to, theophilus,  he says, I wrote this account because I thought it would be good. Luke did not, here's what I'm trying to say, Luke did not one day was sitting, you know,  just to have all of a sudden his hands started to move. He says, I'm, and he picked up a pen, and he says, my gosh, what's going on here?

And he all became an, you know, it was an automatic writing. His personality, his foibles even, his, his culture was all reflected. And that's the reason why you have such that you have, he brews the Greek of Hebrews is so lofty  and the Greek of John is almost like talking to a little kid. And because the, that's what's so wonderful about the Bible, it is an absolutely human book. And yet, it is absolutely thoroughly divine.

So it's not the, it's not the form, but the content and the coherence that shows it's divine, but not the form.

### 中文翻译

今天《纽约时报》把这事登在头版。他们做的事是把圣经逐节“上色”——给经文做颜色编码：红色表示“耶稣很可能真的说过/这事很可能真的发生过”；粉色表示“可能是真的”；灰色表示“多半不是真的”；黑色表示“完全不是真的”。

总体而言，“耶稣研讨会”（Jesus Seminar）认为：圣经里所记载的事情，真正发生过的不会超过15%到20%；耶稣据说讲过的话，真正讲过的也不超过15%到20%。我不认为这是真的。你们拿到讲义了吗？你那边有吗？我来很快带你们过一遍这个论证。

我讲完之后，我至少会留出10分钟在这里回答问题。你可能想挑战一下我的“左脑”——就是我，偏理性、偏逻辑的那一边；也可能想挑战一下“右脑”——坐在那边的Bruce，偏想象、偏艺术的那一边。当然其实我也有想象力，Bruce也很理性；但至少今晚我们就按这个分工来代表一下。还需要更多讲义吗？

我们还有一些。好，这里。

你看这张纸，我给你们举个例子。今晚我并不是要在这张纸上为“圣经的权威性”做论证。我不是在说：看，这是为什么我们必须相信圣经所教导的一切。

我想这张纸上你们会看到一个论证：圣经在历史上是可靠的，福音书向你展示的那位耶稣是真实发生过的、真实存在过的。论证大纲分三步，我来拆开讲。

第一，如果你诚实地去看福音书自己在宣称什么，你会发现它们不是以传奇或虚构小说的方式写成的；它们要么是历史记载，要么就是一个赤裸裸的骗局/蓄意的欺诈——这就是大纲上第一条。福音书不是传奇体，它宣称自己是历史文献；所以它们要么是蓄意的谎言，要么就是历史上可靠的文献。

第二，我们现在知道——五十年前还不那么清楚——所有福音书都写在耶稣死后30到60年之内，也就是在目击证人仍然在世的时期。

既然它们写成于目击证人仍然在世的年代——当时还有成千上万亲眼看见、亲耳听见耶稣的人活着——那么它们是骗局的可能性就很小。

第三，只要你不要先天带着一种“反对神迹”的偏见，我们就会得出结论：如果你拒绝福音书的历史证据，那你就必须同样拒绝我们对古代历史的一切认识；因为用来评估其他古代文献的史学规则，同样会把福音书判定为可信。

这就是整体论证。圣经告诉我们：有一个名叫耶稣的人，自称是神，并行了许多许多神迹，众人都看见了；他被钉十字架死了，之后他从死里复活，至少有数百人见过复活的他——这些都是历史事实，而圣经把这些事实呈现给我们。

我现在很快讲一下：你如何判断任何一份历史文献？你如何对任何古代文献做判断？比如《凯撒高卢战记》、希罗多德、修昔底德这些写历史的人——我们为什么信他们基本可靠？我们不是说他们绝对无误，但我们认为他们大体可信。为什么？有几个规则、几个测试。如果你把这些测试用在圣经上，它也同样会显示自己是一份可靠的历史文献。

第一条我甚至不读——书目/文献传抄测试（bibliographic test）。

不好意思，他那边有一份。你还没有？你怎么没拿到？你是留给别人了吗？

书目测试这部分我先不讲，除非等下有人提问。有些人说：我们没有原稿，那怎么知道？

事实是：我们确实没有原稿，但我们有成百上千份在原稿写成后几十年内出现的抄本——在原稿之后几十年内就有成百份拷贝——所以几乎没人否认：我们今天所拥有的文本，本质上就是福音书作者最初写下的内容。如果有人对此有疑问，我可以展开讲。这是第一。

第二点很重要：体裁测试（genre test）。

你要判断一份古代文献是不是历史记载，你得问：它写出来是为了当“历史”的吗？还是神话？史诗？传奇？

说“福音书是传奇”当然很方便。街上的人经常会这么说：福音书不是历史，是神话，是传奇。

但问题在于：福音书在两方面把这种可能性排除了。

第一，福音书自称是历史记载。Bruce今晚没有读路加福音最开头的一段，但在路加福音开篇，路加写道——我看看能不能找到——他在一开始说：

“有好些人提笔作书，述说在我们中间所成就的事，是照传道的人从起初亲眼看见又传给我们的。我既从起头都详细考察了，就定意要按着次序写给你，使你知道所学之道都是确实的。”

你刚才读了这段？

（“但你用的是钦定本的英语。”）

对。

路加因此告诉我们：福音书写成大致经历了四个阶段。

第一，有目击证人见证他们所看见的。

第二，目击证人的记载被“传递下来”。

五十年前，现代学术界认为：福音书的故事在口述传统中流传多年，过程中被添油加醋，所以就像“耳语传话”一样——你知道那种游戏：一个人对另一个人耳语，传到十个人之后，内容就变了。

人们听错、传错，在传递中改变。

但我们现在知道：犹太教拉比教学的方式，是把一段讲述交给门徒，要求他们严格背诵、死记硬背。门徒绝不会在传承过程中随意修订或改写。

所以我们知道：当时“传递下来”的方式，是通过严格的记忆背诵来传承。因此若路加从目击证人那里得着记述，这些记述可能口传了一段时间，但不太可能被“乱改”。

于是路加说：它们被传递下来。

第三，他说：在他写之前，已经有人写成了其他记述。也就是说在路加之前就有更早的福音书（我们今天没有留存），但当时已经写成。

第四，也是最后，路加说他“查考/核实”过。

他核实的方式，会和任何历史作者核实一样：他会做仔细调查；他可能会核对当时已有的书面记录，确保自己写下的内容不与之矛盾；他也会去访问仍然在世的目击证人，以核对自己的叙述。

所以路加不是在说“我写了个传奇故事”。路加是在说：我竭尽所能，确保我写给你的内容是准确、真实的历史记载。

不止如此：福音书的写作形式，也不符合当时其他虚构体裁。

即便你不看这些自我声明，约翰福音作者自称是目击证人，路加自称使用目击证人的材料。

C.S. Lewis（路易斯）是文学专家、作家，也是牛津与剑桥的文学教授，研究中世纪和文艺复兴文学。他指出一件对我影响很大的事：当人说福音书是虚构、神话或传奇时，要记得：福音书写成时，还没有“现实主义散文小说”这种体裁。

今天我们有“小说”，写的是逼真的虚构，写法像历史记载：他走到门口，拧动门把手，鼻尖滴着汗……你会读到这种“像历史一样写的虚构”。

但那时候没有。

路易斯说，当时的虚构形式主要是：启示文学、传奇、悲剧、寓言等等，并不是现实主义散文。

所以路易斯说：关于福音书的历史性，有些话必须说。我曾是专业文学批评家，我自认分得清“传奇”与“历史叙事”。福音书肯定不是传奇——从某种意义上说，它们甚至“不够好”才像传奇。

Bruce今晚演得很不错，但路易斯要表达的是：如果你真在写虚构，你不会放进那么多与情节推进无关的小细节。

他举例：有人把行淫时被捉的妇人带到耶稣面前，耶稣在地上写字——这细节几乎没有什么教义意义，却正像真实目击叙述会出现的那种“无关紧要但真实”的细节。

路易斯说：如果这不是历史，那它就是一种现实主义散文小说——而这种体裁直到18世纪才出现。

因此，你在讲义第二点看到的是：福音书要么是彻头彻尾的骗局、蓄意的谎言；要么就是历史文献。但你不能说“它们是传奇”。不能这么说。

第三个史学测试是印证/旁证测试（corroboration test）：如果你有一份历史文献，问题是：有没有其他见证人、其他权威能印证它的见证？

我们确实有不少印证。有些外部历史见证我们仍保留着，有些我们已经失传。

你看，我们仍保留的见证：罗马历史学家塔西佗（Tacitus）在约公元115年写道：公元64年尼禄迫害基督徒；他提到基督在提比略作皇帝时，被总督本丢·彼拉多下令处死。

还有一位撒马利亚历史学家（Thallus）在公元52年写世界史，提到耶稣被钉十字架那天日食/黑暗——圣经也提到那天有黑暗。

普林尼（Pliny the Younger）在公元112年提到基督以及他的追随者如何把他当作神敬拜。

约瑟夫斯（Josephus）是犹太历史学家，在公元一世纪写作。近代有人质疑约瑟夫斯的文本是否被基督徒“加工”，因为他对耶稣说了些强烈的话。

但近年我们发现了一些非常古老的文献抄本：有一份10世纪的约瑟夫斯阿拉伯文抄本在近东出土。我们相当确定这更接近原始内容。他在其中写道：耶稣的门徒报告说，他在被钉十字架后三日向他们显现，并且仍然活着。因此他或许就是弥赛亚——关于他，先知曾讲述奇事。

把这些外部证据放在一起：在福音书之外，我们也得到其他历史权威对福音书基本轮廓的印证——耶稣存在，自称是神，行神迹，被钉十字架，他的追随者看见他在身体上从死里复活——这就是基本事实。

但更强的印证，是近代欧洲学界在本世纪提出的结论：过去有人断言福音书和使徒行传直到公元二世纪第三个十年才出现。

19世纪末到20世纪初，许多（尤其是德国）欧洲圣经学者自信地说：你不能在历史上信任圣经，因为福音书至少在事情发生一百年后才写成；故事口传流通一百年后才被人写下来，所以谁知道是否准确。

然而本世纪中后期，考古发现与其他研究表明：福音书都在公元90年之前写成。

如果有人想进一步问，我可以展开；举个快例子：30、40年代左右，人们在埃及亚历山大里亚发现了一小片纸草——约翰福音的一个极小残片，大概就三节经文。

但它是在埃及被发现的，并被碳测定最晚为公元125年。于是学界意识到：若约翰福音（四福音中最晚写成的一卷）到120年就已经出现在亚历山大里亚，那么它必然写成于90到100年之间；因此其他福音书也都是在目击证人仍然在世之时写成的——当时还有许多人亲眼见过耶稣、亲耳听过他讲道、也经历过那些事件。

有趣的是，许多现代学者不愿承认这种时间线变化所带来的含义，但含义是这样的：

新约的核心历史宣称——坟墓是空的、当局无法拿出尸体、许多人见过复活的基督、耶稣自称为神、耶稣公开行神迹（如五饼二鱼、医治、叫死人复活等）——这些都写在公开流通的文献里。

这些文献在地中海世界传播——福音书、甚至保罗书信——而且都是在成百上千仍然活着的人眼前写成、流通的。

比如，保罗在《哥林多前书》15章写道：复活后的基督向数百人显现，其中大多数仍然活着。他把这写在公开文献中。

而你知道，基督教当时非常不受欢迎，许多人急切想把它抹除；基督教又完全建立在这些历史叙述之上。

当时仍有数百目击者在世。所以这些记述不可能在目击者还活着的年代四处流传，除非那些目击者在某种程度上印证/承认它们。

你可以举很多例子。我常用的一个例子是：虽然那是30年前的事，但并不难想象。

1913年是葛底斯堡战役（1863年）的50周年纪念。你知道50年后还有多少老兵活着吗？大约还有两万人。

不可思议。他们聚在一起谈论当年经历。

那么，在这50年内，有人能不能写一本书，描述那些战斗或事件，而当时战场上成千上万的人都还活着、都亲眼见过；除非那些事真的发生过，否则这种书根本无法立得住。

换句话说，在那样的时间框架里必然会有印证。

福音书写得离事件太近了。

因此我们知道：当时必然存在目击者的印证。

到这里我们快讲完了。接下来是神迹的问题。

你看我们走到哪里了：从书目角度，我们基本拥有原始文本；第二，从体裁角度，它们要么是历史文献要么是骗局；第三，它们几乎不可能是骗局；第四，我们看到外部印证。

那么我们是否准备承认：这些文献在告诉我们真实发生过的事？

有人会说：不可能，为什么？答案是：因为里面有神迹，所以不可能。

如果你愿意读讲义下一段，我们可以深入。但五十年前，西方世界主导的是牛顿物理学。牛顿物理学说：自然界有绝对规律，不可能被违反。

今天主导的是量子理论。量子理论说：我们所知道的是自然通常如何运行的方式（惯常模式）。

真正的问题在这里：如果你说“神迹不可能发生”，而一个神迹唯一的证据就是有人写下见证说“我看见了，这就是”，你又在读之前就因为“神迹不可能”而把见证判死刑——那你就是在循环论证。

你是在说：神迹不可能发生，所以神迹没有发生。

这就是循环论证。

只要你愿意不要带着一种不科学、反逻辑、教条式的断言——“只要有神迹就不可能是历史”——你就必须走到这一步：这些文献以历史上可靠的方式告诉我们，确有其人名叫耶稣，他宣称他所宣称的，做了他所做的。

这把我带到这里：C.S. Lewis多年前说——他不是第一个——解释耶稣只有四种可能：他要么是传奇，要么是骗子，要么是疯子，要么就是主（Lord）。

如果你躲在“他是传奇”这个说法后面，说“我们无法知道他到底教导了什么、宣称了什么、做了什么”，那你就可以随便捏造一个你喜欢的耶稣：你可以说他是嬉皮士、革命者、伟大的老师。

但如果他不是传奇，如果路加福音告诉你真实的耶稣，那么你就无法逃避：他要么是彻头彻尾的江湖骗子，要么是彻底的疯子，要么他就是他所说的那一位——没有第四种。

而我之所以成为基督徒，主要原因之一就是：虽然“他真是神的儿子”听起来很疯狂，但若说另外两种解释是真的，反而更不合理。

这就是我们到达的地方。

我还把一页很小字（大概九号Times Roman，挺难读）附在讲义后面。如果有人想让我展开，我可以。

“耶稣研讨会”是一群极端派学者，尽管史学证据显示圣经可靠，他们仍坚持：圣经每一句话都“有罪推定”，除非你能证明它是真的。

如果你用同样的方式对待任何古代历史文献——比如逐页翻《凯撒高卢战记》，说“每一页每一句我都先认为不是真的，除非我找到旁证证明它是真的”——那我们对过去将一无所知。但耶稣研讨会就是这样操作。

在那一页里，我尝试说明：即使按他们用来判断“哪些耶稣的话和事迹算真实”的标准，你也能证明圣经是一份准确、可靠的文献。

如果有人想深入，我们可以。但你可能并不想进入这些话题；你可能不想问“左脑”任何问题。

你也许想问Bruce今晚说的内容、他用到的一些故事或表演方式。不过到这里，我愿意开始回答问题。

请你声音大一点，好让我能对着麦克风重复——因为我想我们在录音——然后我们会尽量回答。好，开始吧，第一位举手的。

这是个好问题。不过你可能未必来得及。

你要听清楚吗？这样吧，你能不能到麦克风那里问，看看能不能收音？因为你坐在过道边。我们不一定能让每个人都这样，但你先试试。哦，行，收得到。

好，请问。

（“有点短。”）

我知道，我知道。把麦克风拉过来一点。这样你的问题就被录下来了。

简单问题：如果我们假设新约——也就是你所说的历史事实——那么其中一部分基础也意味着我们必须依赖旧约，对吗？

因为（如果我理解没错你可以纠正我）新约里，尤其是你今天表演的路加福音，是在确认旧约所说的内容，对吗？还是我错了？我只是想知道我对不对。

嗯，简单问题。

你的意思是：你在问Bruce今晚的意图是什么，还是……

不，不。你说“圣经”时，是指新约加旧约，还是只在讲四福音？因为你做了一个很有说服力的论证：新约可能非常可靠。

对。

但新约的一部分基础在旧约里。比如读《诗篇》15篇，它定义“寻求主的人”是谦卑行事、做主工，却没有提到“人子”。所以我的问题是：如果我们假设新约是对的，那么其中一部分基础也要求旧约要“契合”——这就涉及亚当夏娃、挪亚、亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各……你是不是在说：这些也都必须像你现在这样被证明？还是你只在谈新约？

嗯，这是个长问题。

好，坐下吧。你坐下我来回答。

我不认为：我对“新约文献可靠”的论证，就能证明“旧约文献可靠”。我不这么认为。

我听着呢。

我只是说：即使我能向你证明路加、约翰、马太、马可所写的是可靠的目击记载，并不意味着：因为他们相信挪亚存在，所以挪亚就一定存在。

我今晚只是想给你一个论证：耶稣确实活过他所活的生命、说过他所说的话。

不过我一开始也说了，也许你想问的正是这个：我今晚不是在为整本圣经的权威性做论证。

但如果我要做，我会这样做：首先，新约是否给了我们一幅历史上可靠的耶稣图像？如果是，那你就必须决定如何回应耶稣。

你必须决定：我是否相信他所宣称的？我是否顺服他为主？我是否领受他为神的儿子？

如果你这么做，新约也会让你看到——任何学者都会同意——耶稣相信旧约是真实的。

所以这里其实有三个步骤：

（我把三段推理说乱了，我重来。）

如果新约在历史上可靠，那么我就能看见耶稣确实如此行、如此说；进而我必须面对：他是否是神。

你也许还没准备好走到那一步；如果你还没准备好，那我就不能对旧约多说什么。

但如果你相信耶稣就是他所说的那一位，那么我就相信其余圣经的权威，因为耶稣以权威对待旧约。

因此，我关于新约历史可靠性的论证，并不是关于旧约历史可靠性的论证。

Bruce，你想补充吗？你今晚确实在把话题引向旧约……

他确实（在你今晚没读到的部分里）偶尔会引用以赛亚书，并对同胞犹太人说：“这段经文在你们耳中应验了。”这就像：等等，你在说那段经文写出来就是为了指向你现在发生的事？你在说你是谁？

他常常这样做，他常常谈到旧约的预言之类。

而且有些内容用20世纪理性推理的方式看确实“不好处理”。有些预言他宣称自己应验了，你回去看原文，会想：等等，这真的是在说耶稣吗？似乎不太贴。

但我们要小心，不要用我们自己的文化去要求：啊，这不按我的方式运作，所以就不对。

旧约的希伯来文化与西方希腊式思维非常不同。

对。换句话说，耶稣确实相信旧约是超自然、神所默示的；但你必须先信耶稣，我想，你才可能对旧约的神圣性做论证。

我认为，仅凭史实，你可以对新约的可靠性做出很强的论证。

它把你带到耶稣面前。但你必须借着耶稣，才能走向旧约——这就是Bruce在说的。

好。Ann，你愿意到麦克风吗？

（Ann问：鉴于今晚的讨论，也鉴于有人说纽约市的犹太人比以色列还多，Bruce在最后提到耶稣引用经文说明自己是弥赛亚；能否推荐一本书，帮助Redeemer的人向犹太朋友或同事解释耶稣是弥赛亚？）

Bruce，你有书推荐吗？

我通常希望人问完坐下，但你能不能先澄清：你要找的是一本书，说明耶稣如何应验旧约预言？还是一份预言清单（如以赛亚53、以赛亚7、以赛亚9、诗篇22、申命记——特别是申命记，因为正统犹太人……）？我只是想知道你要找的类型，好让大家知道。

你想找的是：在办公室里、尤其在这时候，人们常和同事谈这些；你想说“耶稣是弥赛亚”，但不知道如何用对方熟悉的语境解释。

我知道Josh McDowell的《铁证待判》（Evidence That Demands a Verdict）花了很多篇幅谈耶稣如何应验旧约预言。

还有John Guest的一本书，我可以在办公室找书名。如果你打电话到办公室问John Guest写的那本谈旧约预言应验的书，我可以给你。

我也可以给你其他资料。

我现在这样说有点危险（人太多），但如果你愿意，我可以给你复印一篇短章，讲耶稣如何应验旧约预言。

另外，“犹太人归主”（Jews for Jesus）那边肯定也有很多相关资料。

所以我想这正是你要的。

（Ann：能否放到楼下书摊上？因为我办公室里很多正统犹太人总在讲塔木德、妥拉，但我不太会解释耶稣如何应验那些预言。）

好建议。

接下来还有谁？如果你不方便到麦克风，就直接说，我复述。

（有人问：你是否听过Chuck Colson用“阴谋论”来反驳复活阴谋的论证？他用自己在政府/水门事件的经验说：当自利受到威胁，谎言很快瓦解；而使徒却为所宣称的事受死。）

我需要把问题更聚焦一点。

你是说Colson谈复活的阴谋论？

他想反驳阴谋论：在水门事件里，国家最高层人物一旦自利受威胁，谎言就散了。

对。他成为基督徒的原因之一是：他看见那些门徒若在撒谎，利益受威胁甚至要丧命时也会散，但他们却为见证受死，所以不可能是普通谎言。

是的。

你想问Tim对此怎么看？

我没听过这个具体论证，但Bruce听过。

我听过。

谢谢。

还有谁？

（有人问：你能评论“次经”（Apocrypha）吗？为什么次经不在圣经里？）

你是指旧约次经还是新约次经？

这就涉及“正典”（canon）的问题，很棘手。

另外，刚才那个Chuck Colson的论证确实很精彩。大家听清了吗？我不确定。

Bruce明白了。他明白。

重点是：Colson知道，如果你们合伙做一个骗局，一旦看起来真的要为此掉脑袋，这个骗局就会瓦解。人不会为了谎言而死。

Colson的意思是：当他读圣经时，很明显复活要么是惊天骗局，要么就是真的。

当人们开始为此受死却无人翻供、阴谋不瓦解，那就说明这不是骗局。

我以前没听过这种说法，但这是个很好的论证。

关于正典：所谓正典，是指圣经中被接纳为神所默示的书卷。

次经是指一些写成却未被纳入正典的书。

其形成过程其实不算特别复杂：当使徒相继去世、最后一位使徒也去世后不久，教会意识到：既然不再有“活的正典”（也就是还活着的使徒可以当作衡量标准），那么需要把那些出自使徒或使徒同工之手的书卷汇集起来。

因为只要还有使徒在世，就可以检验教导是否符合耶稣的教训；但使徒死后，就失去了这种“活的直尺”。

于是他们把新约中那些由使徒写的、或由使徒团体同工写的书卷收集起来：比如路加不是使徒也不是目击者，但他是保罗的同工，所以路加所写代表保罗式的使徒教导；马可不是使徒，但他是彼得的同工；还有马太、约翰等等。

凡是自称出自使徒之手、但被认为是假托/伪名或来历不明的书卷，就不被接纳。

（有人开玩笑说：伪名不一定等于匿名，但同样都是“事后才写”的。）

他们不仅查考书卷的“谱系/出处”，也查考这些书卷是否在教会中被神使用、主是否藉它们作工。

正典大致在最后的目击者去世后不久就成形。

旧约正典在耶稣降生前就已确立（雅姆尼亚会议等），甚至更早。

我们之所以接受旧约正典，是因为耶稣接受。

我们对旧约的一切信念，最终都以耶稣为依据。

耶稣引用旧约各卷（除了以斯帖）；使徒也引用我们今天所拥有的旧约正典。

所以，次经（无论新旧）之所以不在正典里，根本原因与耶稣及使徒传统有关：新约书卷必须出自使徒或耶稣的同工；旧约则是耶稣所承认的那一套。

好，我们继续。

（Seth提到：他与犹太朋友讨论耶稣应验旧约预言时，拿出自己圣经的旧约经文，却发现对方的译本与自己的译本不同。）

坦白说，你很难靠争这个赢。

除非你去读书——真的去学希伯来文、上研究生课程。

因为翻译再怎么努力客观，也总带有解释性；翻译永远不可能只是音译/逐字对应。

译者会尽力，但他们总有立场。

那些不相信耶稣应验预言的人，往往会把预言“翻译掉”，用一些词把你引向别处。

根据1990年人口普查，大约10%的犹太人说他们相信耶稣是弥赛亚，你知道吗？这对很多人很难接受。

非基督徒的犹太运动有很强的动机：确保那些几百年来一直被基督徒引用的经文，不要被翻得像基督徒旧约那样。

我不是说这就是赤裸裸地扭曲，但这是现实。

所以你若要继续，就得自己去查这些经文的原文。

而如果他是正统犹太人，他很可能比你更懂希伯来文。

所以在这些段落上我不会跟他硬争；我会换个话题去谈。

明白吗？你还没准备好在那上面打。

（有人问：比较不同译本是否有帮助？）

是的，有帮助，但仍不能完全解决。

我倒想问Bruce：我很喜欢你用钦定本。你读的是纯钦定本，还是自己做了些改写？你用的是什么译本？

谢谢Tim。基本上是钦定本。有些约翰福音的段落用的是NRSV（新修订标准译本）。偶尔有一些十五/十六世纪的词我不懂意思，就换成了较新的译法。但在一小时半里我改的也就二三十个词而已，绝大多数是钦定本。

你为什么用钦定本？

因为我老板要求我用。

你老板是谁？

John Jury，是路易斯维尔演员剧院（Actor Theater Louisville）的艺术总监。这是正规的职业剧院，完全不是基督徒机构，相信我。这演出上过百老汇。就像我开场说的，这是他献给复活节的作品。

你看到钦定本的好处吗？

钦定本写出来就是为了“被讲出来”，因为当时很多人不识字，所以它是一种讲台语言。

这有点像莎士比亚：读起来难，因为本来就不是写给你默读的，而是写给你说出来、演出来的。

而且，如果你想想，这些原本就是目击见证。最初路加很可能得到的是口述证词。

人们最初是在讲述给别人听。

你可以想象一个人告诉路加：我进到拿因城，耶稣和很多门徒在那里；一个死人的尸体正被抬出去；耶稣对尸体说了几句话，那尸体坐起来开始说话；耶稣把他交给他母亲，众人就惧怕……你能想象目击者讲述时的样子。

而不是那种“那时到了……于是他来到……”那种敬虔但生硬的读法。

三百年来人们在教会里读得很“平淡”，于是有人以为这是无聊材料。

我以前有个学生写演出评论，说：Bruce Cune把原本无聊的材料演得很精彩。

我想：等等，这怎么会无聊？枯干的手得痊愈；死人复活；这怎么会无聊？

可能我们把它弄得太“神圣”，反倒失去了它本来的震撼。

所以我也很喜欢他用钦定本：第一，它语言很美；第二，当它被“早期诠释”——不仅是读，而是像当初那样讲述出来——它更有意义。

我太喜欢了。

我再回答几个问题，但你们知道，我真的很喜欢他用钦定本。

有人说：这就是耶稣自己说话的方式。

有人还开玩笑说：如果钦定本对使徒保罗都够好，那对我也够好。

好，再来几个问题。我们必须在8:15结束。

如果你们可以再多留10分钟，我会把大家送走。

（有人称赞Bruce的表演非常出色，录音留档。）

然后他提问：耶稣的存在到底有多真实？

接着他提出：为什么新约四位作者的书卷形式与旧约不同？如果我们相信神借摩西写旧约，为何新约又换成四个人？因此我能看见耶稣的存在……

问题是：新约的写作形式与旧约很不同。如果神写了旧约和新约，为什么会这么不同？

回答是：正如耶稣完全是人、也完全是神——不是半人半神，而是100%人、100%神——圣经既是神的书，也是人的书；既是人的书，也是神的书。

说它很“人”，并不是否认它的神性：作者是有意识地写作的，运用自己的个性、文化形式来写。

这并不削弱“神藉他们写下他要写的一切、每一个词都是神所要写的”的事实。

因此，你不能因为神写了整本圣经，就认为全书会呈现同一种文学形式或人格风格。

主题与真理是一致、彼此连贯的；但形式会因作者而异。

比如路加对提阿非罗说：我写这卷书，因为我认为这样做是好的。

路加不是某天坐着，忽然手自己动起来，拿起笔说：天哪发生什么了？然后像“自动写作”一样。

他的个性、甚至他的弱点、他的文化都反映在文字里。

这就是为什么《希伯来书》的希腊文如此高雅，而约翰福音的希腊文几乎像在跟小孩说话。

这正是圣经的奇妙之处：它完全是人的书，同时也完全是神的书。

所以显示其神性的不是统一的“形式”，而是其内容与真理的连贯一致。

今天的报纸把这事登在了头版。他们做的就是把圣经从头到尾过一遍，然后给圣经经文做颜色标注。他们会用红色标出来：如果他们认为耶稣很可能说过这句话，或者这事很可能真的发生过。用粉色：如果它也许是真的。用灰色：如果它很可能不是真的。用黑色：如果它完全不是真的。

总体来说，“耶稣研讨会”认为：圣经里所记载的事情，真正发生过的不超过 15% 到 20%；耶稣被说成讲过的话，真正讲过的也不超过 15% 到 20%。我不认为这是真的。你们拿到讲义了吗？你那边有吗？我先很快带你们过一遍这个论证。

我讲完之后，至少会留出 10 分钟。我们会在这里回答问题。你可能想质疑的是左脑——也就是我。我想算左脑、理性那一边；或者你可能想质疑右脑——就是这边的 Bruce，比较有想象力的那一边。其实我也有些想象力，而 Bruce 也相当理性；但至少今晚，我们就各自代表一下。还需要多拿几份吗？

我们这儿还有一些，是的。给。你看这份，我给你们做个说明。今晚我并不是在这张纸上为“圣经的权威性”作论证。我不是要说——我不是在说：这是为什么我们必须相信圣经所教导一切的论证。

我想你们这上面写的是：圣经在历史上是可靠的，福音书向你展示的那位耶稣确实发生过、确实存在过。这里是论证的大纲，分三步，然后我再把它拆开讲。第一，如果你诚实地看福音书所宣称的内容，你会发现它们并不是以传奇或虚构的方式写成；它们要么是历史记述，要么就是一个蓄意的骗局——这就在大纲一开头。福音书不是以传说体裁写成的；它们宣称自己是历史文献，所以它们要么是蓄意的骗局，要么就是在历史上可靠的文献。第一点。第二点，我们现在知道——五十年前我们就知道——所有福音书都是在耶稣死后、仍在目击者有生之年的时间里写成的，也就是在耶稣去世后 30 到 60 年之内，在……

就在目击者仍在世的一生之内。

既然这些书写成的时间仍在目击者的有生之年——在成千上万曾亲耳听见、亲眼见过耶稣的人仍然在世的时候——那么它们是骗局的可能性就非常小。第三点：只要你不是带着一种先天、根深蒂固的“反对神迹”的偏见，我们就会得出这样的结论：如果你拒绝接受福音书在历史层面的证据，那么你就必须拒绝承认我们能知道任何关于古代的事情；因为用来检验其他古代文献的同一套史学规则（史料学方法），也同样表明福音书是可信的。情况就是这样。圣经告诉我们，有一个名叫耶稣的人，他宣称自己是神，并且行了许许多多的神迹，人们亲眼看见了。

他被钉在十字架上死了之后，又从死里复活，至少有几百人看见他复活了。这些都是历史事实，而圣经把这些事实呈现给我们。现在我很快把刚才提到的再梳理一遍：你如何评判任何一份历史文献？你如何对任何一部古代作品作判断——比如《凯撒的高卢战记》、希罗多德、修昔底德这些写历史的人——我们为什么信任他们？

我们之所以把他们当作基本可靠的史料，并不是说他们没有任何错误，而是说整体上是可信的。那你为什么信任他们？有几条规则——几项你用来检验历史文献的测试；如果你把这些测试用在圣经上，你也会发现它同样是一份可靠的历史文献。下面是这些测试。

第一点（这一点我甚至不打算展开念），书目学测试（bibliographic test）。如果有人——不好意思——他手里有一份，你却没有。你怎么没拿到？你是不是留了一份？

书目学测试——你们总能再拿到。说到讲义，它有点像吗哪：每天都会从天上掉下来，就这么出现。这个书目学测试我先不讲，除非待会儿有人再提。有些人会说：“我们没有原稿，那怎么知道内容可靠呢？”

事实是：我们确实没有原稿，但我们有数百份文献——在原稿写成后几十年内的数百份抄本——因此几乎没有人否认，我们今天所拥有的基本上就是福音书作者当初写下来的内容。要是有人手里有一…

关于这个问题，我会讲到。这是第一点。第二点很重要：体裁检验。

如果你想判断一份古代文献是否属于历史记载，你必须问自己：它写作的目的是什么？是要写历史吗？是写神话吗？是写史诗吗？是写传说吗？把福音书说成“传说”当然很省事。

路上的人常常会这么跟你讲。你说：啊，可是福音书……他们就说：那不是历史，是神话，是传说。但问题在于，福音书在两个方面都把这种可能性排除了。第一，福音书自己宣称是在写历史性的叙述。Bruce 没有讲到路加福音最最开头那一段，但在路加福音一开始我们就读到——路加说，让我看看能不能在这里找到——就在路加福音开头，你应该很熟。

“许多人……嗯，对，我就引用这一段。其实我刚才回头找的时候……啊，你说得对，你确实提到了，我听到了；只是当我坐下来时，你已经讲过去了。

‘有好些人提笔作书，述说在我们中间所成就的事，是照传道的人从起初亲眼看见、又传给我们的。’所以我‘从起头都详细考察了’，‘按着次序写给你’，使你‘知道这些事的确实’。你刚才说了这段，对吧？

但你用的是《钦定版》的英语。对。

因此，路加是在告诉我们：福音书的写成经历了四个阶段。第一，我在这里也列出来了：首先，有目击者为他们所看见的事作见证。第二，目击者的记载被传递下来。50 年前，现代学术界认为福音书的记述经过多年口头传统的流传并被不断添油加醋，因此就成了一种“悄悄话”效应。

你知道“悄悄话”怎么玩吗？一个人对另一个人耳语，等传到 10 个人队列的末尾时，内容就变了。人们听错了，也会在传递过程中把它改掉。我们现在知道，犹太教中拉比教导的方式是：他们会给门徒……

一个叙述，把它交给他们，让他们一字不差地死记硬背。门徒从拉比那里领受这些内容之后，是绝对不允许随意修改的；从来没有这种做法。

因此我们知道，叙述被传递下来的方式是严格背诵。所以如果路加是从目击者那里得到这些叙述，它们在被传递的这些年里当然会流传一段时间，但绝不可能被人随意篡改。他说这些内容是“传下来的”。第三点，他说在他写作之前，已经有人写过别的叙述了。有更早的福音书，我们现在没有保存下来，但当时已经有人把它们写成文字。

最后，路加说他核查过。核查的方式会和任何作者核查资料的方式一样：他会做早期的调查。他很可能会对照自己手头的书面记录，确保他写下来的内容不与之矛盾。他也会采访仍然在世的目击者，来核对他的叙述。

所以路加所说的不是“我写了一个传说”。路加说的是：我竭尽所能，确保我写给你的、我正在写的，是完全准确、具有历史性的记载。不仅如此，福音书的体裁也不符合当时其他虚构文类的特征。即便你没有这些自述，约翰福音的作者也宣称自己是目击者；路加则宣称他使用了目击者的见证。

C.S.路易斯是一位研究文学的人——他写作，并且是文学方面的专家。他在牛津和剑桥任教，讲授中世纪和文艺复兴文学。他指出了一件事，哎呀，对我影响很大。他说，当人们说福音书是虚构的，是神话，是传说时，

你必须记得，在福音书写成的那个年代，并不存在所谓“写实的散文虚构”。今天我们有一种东西叫小说。在小说里，你会看到写实的虚构作品；它写得像一份历史记载：那个人走到门口，转动门把手，汗从他的鼻子上滴下来。

你会读到这样的虚构作品，但在那个时代并不是这样。路易斯说，当时的虚构形式是启示文学、传说，

悲剧、还有寓言，它们都不是写实的散文。所以路易斯指出了这一点。他说，关于福音书的历史性，必须说点什么：我曾经是一名职业文学评论家。

我想我确实知道传奇和历史写作之间的区别。福音书当然不是传奇；从某种意义上说，它们“还不够好”，不够好。它们不够好。现在，布鲁斯已经讲得相当不错了，但路易斯想说的是：如果你真是在写虚构小说，里面就不会塞进这么多与情节毫无关系的小细节。他说，如果它们不是历史，那么它们就只能是某种写实散文式的虚构——而这种文体实际上直到18世纪以前根本不存在。

像他们把那位行淫时被捉的妇人带到耶稣面前时，耶稣在地上写字这样的短小片段——在教义上完全没有任何意义——正是这种写作的标志。所以你看到，你这里的第二点是：福音书要么是彻头彻尾的骗局、蓄意的谎言；要么就是历史文献。但你唯一不能说的是，“嗯，它们只是传奇。”你不能这么说。第三个历史学（史学写作）的检验，是“印证检验”。如果你有一份历史文献，接下来会出现的问题是：有没有办法知道其他见证人、其他权威来源能够印证它的证词？

而我们有大量的印证。我们有一些仍然保存下来的历史见证，也有一些我们已经不再拥有的见证。现在你看，我们仍然拥有的这些见证：这里有塔西佗，这位罗马历史学家，在1815年写道，在主后64年，尼禄惩罚基督徒，然后他说，基督是在提比略作皇帝时，奉总督本丢·彼拉多之命被处决的。有一位撒马利亚历史学家名叫斯塔拉斯，在主后52年写了一部世界史，其中提到耶稣被钉十字架那天也发生了日食——也就是圣经所说的黑暗。普林尼·小（主后112年）提到基督，以及他的追随者如何把他当作上帝来敬拜。

约瑟夫是一位历史学家，一位犹太历史学家，他在主后……主后写作。近来，有些人质疑约瑟夫的……

历史曾被基督徒“修饰”过，因为他说了一些关于耶稣的强烈言论。然而近来我们发现了一些非常古老的文献、一些抄本；在近东某地出土了一份用阿拉伯文写成的、约瑟夫斯著作的十世纪抄本，而我们相当确定这基本上就接近原貌。他在里面这样说：耶稣的门徒报告说，耶稣在被钉十字架后三天向他们显现，并且仍然活着。因此，他或许就是那位弥赛亚——先知们曾记述过他所行的奇事的那一位。所以把这些史料放在一起看，你会发现：在福音书之外，还有其他历史权威对福音记载的基本轮廓作了印证。

耶稣确实存在，宣称自己是神，行过神迹，被钉十字架；他的跟随者看见他在肉身上从死里复活——这就是最基本的框架。但更有力的印证，是我可能已经提到过的：欧洲学术界曾经强烈地主张（尤其在圣经研究领域），福音书和使徒行传并不是在公元二世纪第三个十年之前存在的（更不可能早于此）。在十九世纪末等时期，许许多多——尤其是德国的欧洲圣经学者——都十分自信地断言：你不能在历史层面信任圣经，因为它至少是在事件发生一百年之后才写成；福音书至少是一百年后才写成；那些叙述在口头流传了一百年，然后才有人把它写下来，所以谁知道它们到底准不准确。

然而，在本世纪中后期，考古发现以及其他学者的研究已经证明：所有福音书都在公元90年之前写成。若有人想就此再问更多问题，我们可以深入谈；这里只举一个快速的例子：大概在三十年代或四十年代，他们发现了一片纸草文书——非常小的一块《约翰福音》残片，大概就三节经文而已，就只找到这些。

但他们是在埃及的亚历山大城发现它的，并用碳十四测定其年代：最晚不超过公元125年。因此他们意识到：如果《约翰福音》——四卷福音书中最后写成的一卷——在公元120年左右已经出现在亚历山大，那么它必定是在公元90到100年间写成的，因此其他福音书则是

这些内容都是在目击者仍然在世的时候写成的——在那些亲眼见过耶稣、听过祂讲道、并且在所有事件发生时就在现场的人还活着的年代写成的。

有意思的是，许多现代学者并不愿意承认这种时间跨度变化所带来的含义，但含义其实很清楚：新约的核心历史主张——比如耶稣的坟墓是空的、当局无法拿出尸体、许多人看见复活的基督、耶稣宣称自己是神、耶稣行过公开的神迹（如喂饱五千人、医治、叫死人复活等）——这些全都写在公开的文献里。

这些文献在地中海沿岸流传——无论是福音书，还是保罗的书信——并且都是在仍有数百位相关见证人健在的时候写成的。举例说，保罗在《哥林多前书》15章里写到：基督复活之后，有数百人见过祂，而且其中大多数如今仍然活着；他把这话写在一份公开的文献里。而基督教在当时非常不受欢迎，你也知道，人们迫切想把它抹除。基督教又完全建立在这些历史记载之上。既然还有数百人仍在世上，那么这些记载若没有被那些见证人所证实，就绝不可能在目击者仍在世的时候四处流传。

你知道，这类例子还有很多。我常用的一个例子是：虽然那已经是三十年前的事了，但并不难想象。比如，1913年是葛底斯堡战役五十周年纪念——葛底斯堡战役是哪一年？1863年，正好五十周年。你知道在那之后五十年，还有多少老兵仍然活着吗？大概还有两万人。

这很不可思议。他们都聚在一起谈论那些事。那么，在那五十年之内，有人真的能写出一本书，描述那些战斗或当时发生的事——而战场上成百上千的人都亲眼见过——并且在这些人仍然活着的年代流传开来吗？除非那些事确实发生过，你明白吗？

在那段时间范围内一定存在彼此印证的佐证。福音书写成的时间离事件发生太近了。

因此我们也知道，必定有目击者的印证。好，现在我们来到结尾了。关于神迹的问题——你看我们现在所处的位置：从文献学的角度说，我们基本上掌握了原始文本。第二，体裁——它们要么是历史文献，要么是骗局。第三，它们极不可能是骗局。

它们极不可能是骗局。我们已经看到那些相互印证的证据。那么，我们准备好承认这些文献在向我们呈现真实发生的事情了吗？如果有人说：“不可能。”为什么？答案是：因为有人说，里面有神迹，所以不可能。

现在，如果你愿意读接下来的这一段、也愿意进入这个问题，我可以继续讲。但五十年前，牛顿物理学在西方世界占主导。牛顿物理学认为，自然界有绝对的定律，不可能被违背。今天主导的是量子理论。而量子理论说，我们所知道的只是自然通常如何运作的方式。

真正的问题在这里：如果你说神迹不可能发生；而一件神迹唯一的证据就是有人写下一份记述说：“我看见了，就是这样”；然后你又说神迹不可能发生，于是你在读之前就把一份关于神迹的证据记述先否定掉——那你就是在循环论证。你在说：神迹不可能发生，因此神迹没有发生。

这就是循环论证。只要你愿意不带着一种不科学、反逻辑、教条式的断言——“这份记述里若有神迹，它就不可能是历史”——你就已经走到这一步：如果你去掉那种偏见，你就必须说：这份记述以一种在历史上可靠的方式告诉我们，确有一个名叫耶稣的人，他宣称他所宣称的，并做了他所做的。然后这就把我带到这里。

C.S. 路易斯多年前说过——而且他并不是第一个这样说的人——解释耶稣只有四种可能：他要么是传说，要么是骗子，要么是疯子，要么就是主。现在，如果你躲在“他只是个传说”这个想法后面，如果你

也就是说，如果我们根本无法真正知道他教导了什么、宣称了什么、做过什么，那么你就可以随心所欲地捏造一个“耶稣”，对吧？

你可以说：我觉得他是个嬉皮士式的理想主义者；我觉得他是个革命家；你知道，我觉得他是一位伟大的教师。但如果他不是传说人物——如果《路加福音》告诉你的是一位真实的耶稣——那你就逃不掉了：要么他是个彻头彻尾的骗子，要么他是个完全的疯子，要么他就是他所宣称的那一位；除此之外没有别的选项。而我之所以是基督徒，其中一个主要原因是：尽管“他其实可能真是神的儿子”这听起来非常疯狂，但认为另外两个选项会是真的，反而更说不通。

所以我们就到这儿了。另外我也在你们的讲义里附上了一页，字体大概是九号字——抱歉，是九号 Times Roman——挺难读的；但如果有人希望我详细讲讲，我可以。所谓“耶稣研讨会”（Jesus Seminar）是一群激进的学者，尽管有史学方法上的证据表明《圣经》是可靠的，他们仍坚持：圣经里的任何一节经文都是“有罪的”，除非被证明是真的。要是你用同样的方法去对待任何其他古代历史文献——比如你去读凯撒的《高卢战记》，或任何古代文献——然后说：每一页上的每一句话，我都先当作不真实，除非我找到某个佐证的证人能向我证明它是真的。

如果你这样做，我们对过去就会一无所知；但这就是“耶稣研讨会”的运作方式。在那一页里，我试图向你说明：即便你采用他们用来判定耶稣哪些言行是真实的那些标准，就算按他们的标准，你也完全可以证明《圣经》是一份准确、可靠的文献。如果有人想让我展开讲，我们可以讲。现在你可能并不想钻进这些东西里，你可能也不想让左脑去问任何问题。

你也许更想问 Bruce（布鲁斯）今晚说过的某些话，或他讲的那些故事、那些叙述；不过到这个时候，我愿意开始回答问题了。你们需要说得大声一点，好让我能把问题重复到麦克风里，因为我想我们正在录音；然后我们会尽力回答。那么我们开始吧，

亲眼见过。这是个好问题。是的，不过你可能没法走到他们那儿去。

你愿意听吗？愿意。那这样吧——你坐在过道边，能不能到麦克风那儿把问题再问一遍，看看能不能收进去？当然我们不可能对每个人都这么做，不过你试试看。哦，可以，能收进去。

好，请提问。好的。尽量简短。我知道，我知道。

把它转过来。这样你的问题就会录到磁带里。简单问题：如果我们先假设新约——也就是你所说的历史事实——我们先假设连同其中的神迹都是真的，那么其中一部分依据也必须同时依赖旧约。按你刚才的说法，这对吗？

因为我假设——如果我错了你可以纠正我——新约，比如你今天讲路加福音的方式，是在确认旧约里已有的内容。是这样吗？还是我理解错了？我只是想知道我对不对。嗯，简单问题。

你的意思是，你在问布鲁斯的本意是什么，还是……？不，不，你在说新约。你说“圣经”的时候，是指新约和旧约都包括吗？还是你只是指福音书？因为我觉得你提出的论证很有说服力，说明新约可能非常可靠。

对。但新约的基础有一部分在旧约里。举一个例子：如果你读诗篇第15篇，它说，界定“主”的意思，是要谦卑行事、做主的工，却没有提到“人子”。所以我的问题是：如果我们假设新约是对的——就像你所说——其中一部分依据来自旧约，那么旧约是否也要契合？那就意味着亚当和夏娃、那就意味着挪亚、那就意味着亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各——对我们而言意味着什么？我们是否也要像你现在这样，要求那些也必须被证明？还是说只需要新约就行？不，我这问题有点长。

很好。请坐。你坐下我就回答。我并不认为，我关于新约文献可靠的论证，就能证明旧约文献也可靠。我不这么认为。

好，那我听着。我要说得直一点，因为我认为我可以表明……

认为路加、约翰、马太、马可给了我们关于所发生之事可靠的目击者见证，并不等于说：因为他们相信挪亚存在，所以挪亚就一定存在。我想我所做的，只是要给你一个理由，说明耶稣确实活过，并且确实过了那样的生活、说了那些话。

不过我一开始也告诉过你——也许你正想问到这一点——今晚我并不是在论证整本圣经的权威；但如果我要这样做，我会这么做：我会先问，新约是否给了我们一幅在历史上可靠的耶稣图像？如果是，那我们就必须决定要如何面对耶稣。

你必须决定：我是否相信他所说的他是谁？我是否愿意顺服他为主？我是否接受他为神的儿子？如果你这样做，新约就会向你显明——任何学者都会告诉你——耶稣相信旧约是真实的。所以，这个三段论其实有三个步骤。

如果圣经是可靠的，那么耶稣就是神；如果新……不好意思，对不起，我把三段论说乱了。应该是：如果新约在历史上是可靠的，那么我就能看见耶稣是神。你也许还没准备好这么做。如果你还没准备好，那么我就无法对旧约说什么。但如果你相信耶稣就是他所宣称的那一位，那么我就相信圣经其余部分的权威，因为耶稣对待它是带着权威的。

不过，我为新约在历史上的可靠性所做的论证，其实完全不是在为旧约的历史可靠性作论证。

你对此想说点什么吗，布鲁斯？你今晚其实是想把话题引到旧约上来。是的，你确实引用了旧约……我不知道他算不算引用。嗯，是。

耶稣确实会——在你今晚没看到的其他段落里——引用以赛亚书的经文，并对人、对同为犹太人的同胞说：这段经文已经在你们耳中应验了。那意思就像是在说：等一下，你是说那段话之所以被写下来，就是为了让这件事发生在你们身上？你到底在宣称自己是谁？我的意思是，他经常这样做；他也常常谈到旧约、预言之类的事情。

而其中有一些……

……

其中有些并不符合二十世纪的推理方式。有些就像——你知道，他提到自己是在应验某些预言。你回去把那些经文找出来一看，就会觉得：等一下，我们确定那是在讲耶稣吗？好像对不上。似乎不太符合我们这种理性……

所以我们得小心，别把自己的文化带进去就说：啊哈，这种方式行不通。因为——我的意思是——旧约的希伯来文化，甚至与西方的希腊式思维相比，都非常不同。对。换句话说，耶稣确实相信旧约是超自然、出于神的，但你必须相信耶稣……我认为，在你能为旧约的神圣性提出论证之前，你得先相信耶稣。我觉得只凭事实，你就能为新约极其可靠这一点提出很好的论证。

这会把你带到耶稣那里。但要到达旧约，你必须先经过耶稣——这就是布鲁斯刚才在说的。好吧，安，你想试试麦克风吗？好。鉴于我们正在进行的讨论，也鉴于有人说纽约市的犹太人比以色列的还多。

在讲座的最后，布鲁斯谈到那些经文——耶稣亲自解释他就是弥赛亚。你能推荐一本书，帮助救赎教会里那些有犹太朋友或同事的人，向他们解释耶稣就是弥赛亚吗？布鲁斯，你有推荐吗？抱歉，我通常喜欢大家问完问题就坐下，不过也许你能先说明一下：你是想找一本书，专门证明耶稣应验了旧约预言的吗？还是那种把预言列出来的清单，比如以赛亚书53章、以赛亚书7章、以赛亚书9章、诗篇22篇、申命记——尤其是申命记，因为对犹太人，尤其是正统派犹太人来说——好，我只是想知道书名，好让大家知道，特别是在每年的这个时候，你会在办公室里碰到这类谈话。

“嗯，耶稣是弥赛亚，可是我不太知道怎样用你自己的术语来解释。”好的，我知道乔什·麦克道威尔的《铁证待判》确实花了

在耶稣如何应验旧约预言这件事上，我没有花很多时间去讲。有一本约翰·盖斯特（John Guest）的书，我可以……那本在办公室里。你打电话到办公室，问有没有约翰·盖斯特写的一本书，里面有……我也可以再给你一些别的资料。呃——在这么多人面前这么说有点危险——但如果你愿意，我可以给你复印一小章，讲耶稣如何应验旧约预言。我知道如果你联系“犹太人为耶稣”（Jews for Jesus），他们肯定会有各种关于这方面的文件。

不过我想那正是你在找的。我的意思是，我们能不能把它放到楼下的书桌上，这样当我们……因为我办公室里有很多正统派犹太人，他们总在跟我谈《塔木德》，谈《妥拉》怎么谈到《塔木德》，但我不太知道该怎么解释耶稣如何应验了所有那些预言。好吧。好建议。可以。

好。还有别的人吗？我不知道你能不能到麦克风那里。你有问题吗？是的，我看到你了。

你为什么不——先生——下来一下吧，这样会帮我们，因为这样就会录在磁带里。不好意思让你这么做。也许我只是……如果你坐的位置不方便出来，我不会让每个人都这么做。你说吧。我不知道你有没有听说过查克·科尔森（Chuck Colson）提出过一个“阴谋论”的论证。

他试图反驳阴谋论，他用自己在政府里的经历，说到维持阴谋持续下去的好处，以及一旦阴谋被揭露所要面对的审判/后果；他也把这个联系到他所认为使徒们的处境——他们是怎样作见证的，以及维持那个所谓的（如果真的有）阴谋所带来的好处与审判。你有没有……你读过那个吗？先别离开那个麦克风。我得把这个问题聚焦得更清楚一点。好。你是说查克·科尔森讲的是关于复活的阴谋论，对吗？

不，他试图反驳的就是你刚才在说的那种。他说，当他卷入“水门事件”的时候，全国最顶层的那些人，一旦自身利益受到威胁，谎言立刻就散架了。对。那就是他成为基督徒的原因，因为他看见发生了什么，而那些人的……

门徒们的谎言受到了威胁，但他们却为着什么而死呢？所以这不可能——如果你说的是这个的话——这就不是一种普通的谎言，对吧？嗯。

嗯，是有人问那个问题吗？是的，我想知道 Tim 有没有……有没有听说过这个，他对此有什么看法。没有，但 Bruce 听过。好吧。我听过。

是的。谢谢。谢谢你。谢谢。还有别人吗？

你说吧，就说出来，我来重复。呃，你能评论一下《次经》吗？为什么《次经》不在《圣经》里？Tim？等一下，你指的是旧约次经，还是新约次经？

好。嗯，对，你提到了整套关于“正典”（canon）的问题，这确实很棘手。我之前也没听说过 Chuck Holson 那个“阴谋论”的说法。顺便说一句，那真是个很棒的点。你们都听到了吗？我不太确定。

Bruce 明白了。他明白了。那个点是：Chuck Holson 知道，如果你们是一伙人在合编一个骗局，那么一旦看起来人们真的要为此掉脑袋，这个骗局就会瓦解。人不会在一个谎言上坚持到底，如果代价是为它去死。他说，Holson 显然是在读《圣经》的时候看到：复活这件事要么是一个惊人的骗局，要么就是真实。

他说：当人们开始为了这个“骗局”而死，却没有人翻供，这事也没有散架，那就意味着它不是骗局，对吧？所以我想让你们——所以我觉得这真是……我以前没听过，但这是一个很精彩的论证。现在，说到正典，正典指的是《圣经》中哪些书被接纳为出于神、受默示的书卷的数量与范围。确实有一些很有力量的书，是写出来了，但从来没有被纳入正典、作为《圣经》的一部分。事情是这样运作的：其实也没那么复杂。当使徒们逐渐去世、最后一位使徒去世之后，不久教会就认为这非常重要——因为你不再有一个“活的正典”，也就是说，当有人写东西或教导什么的时候，只要还有几位使徒在世，你总还有一种办法去核对它到底是否……

他们的教导与耶稣所教导的是一致的。

但是当使徒们去世之后，人们意识到他们的生命不再有一把“活的直尺”来校正了。不，他们需要——所以他们需要把圣经里所有的书卷，也就是新约，汇集起来；这些书卷要么是由某位使徒写的，要么是由使徒的同工写的。这样它所体现的就要么是直接的使徒教导，要么是出自使徒团体之内、与使徒群体相关的教导。比如你有路加，你知道，他不是使徒，也不是亲眼见证者，但他是保罗的同工。所以从这个意义上说，路加所呈现的是保罗式的使徒教导。你还有马可，虽然他不是使徒，但他是彼得的同工；还有马太、约翰，等等等等。

他们所做的，就是把那些他们明白是由使徒写的、或属于使徒同工团体写的书卷收集起来，因为他们知道使徒的教导就在其中。凡是有书卷声称出自某位使徒之手，但他们判断那是冒名的（伪托名的）或不署名的——正如有位教师曾经打趣说，“伪托名”虽然不一定等同于“不署名”，但同样也可以说是“事后托名”（post-alonymous）。如果他们觉得某卷书不是使徒所写，或它并不代表使徒的教导，他们就把它剔除；也就是说，他们不接纳它。他们非常谨慎：他们不仅查验这些书卷的“谱系”（来源与真伪），也查验这些书卷是否在教会的生命中被上帝使用，主是否真的借着它们做工。

在最后一位目击者去世后不久，他们就形成了一份正典。这就是他们形成正典的方式。

至于旧约正典，在耶稣来之前就已经确立了，在雅姆尼亚会议（Council of Jamnia）时被定下来，而且更早就已固定。我们之所以接受旧约正典，是因为耶稣接受它。再说一次，你知道，我们对旧约的一切信念，其实都是建立在耶稣之上的。

耶稣引用了旧约的每一卷书——除了《以斯帖记》。他引用了……而使徒们当然是他的门徒，他们也引用了我们今天所拥有的那套旧约正典。因此基本上，耶稣就是原因

为什么次经（apocryphal）书卷——无论是新约还是旧约的——不被纳入圣经正典。它们必须是由使徒或耶稣的亲密同工所写；而旧约的话，必须是耶稣所认可、所引用并承认权威的那些书卷。原因就在这里。好，我们继续，Seth。

Seth 说，他有几次跟一位朋友——一位犹太朋友——谈话，试着证明耶稣应验了旧约预言。他会从自己手里的旧约圣经里拿出一段预言，可那段经文的译法，却跟他朋友圣经里的译法对不上。坦白讲，这一点你很难“赢过”对方。为什么？除非你自己具备那种能力——当然，你总可以去读书，比如去修一门希伯来文和旧约的研究生课程。

这其实非常常见。你看——我得小心措辞——翻译者再怎么努力保持客观，也很自然会……怎么说呢，当他们处理文本时，翻译总在某种程度上就是解释。翻译从来不只是把字母逐字搬过去（那叫音译/直译式转写）；你必须做解释。你会非常努力想要客观，但问题是：你一定带着某种立场。

而那些并不相信耶稣是在应验预言的诠释者，常常会把预言“翻译掉”——他们会选用一些词，让你离那个指向耶稣的意思越来越远。犹太人群体中那股非基督徒的犹太运动（也就是拒绝基督信仰的犹太阵营）对这一点有很强的利害关系。你知道吗？1990 年的人口普查显示，有 10% 的犹太人说他们相信耶稣是弥赛亚。这对很多人来说很难接受。但正因为如此，非基督徒的犹太阵营就有强烈动机，确保那些经文——几个世纪以来一直被人拿来“指着他们说”的那些经文——不要被翻译得像基督徒的旧约译本那样。

我不是说这就等于是赤裸裸地、彻底地“歪曲”，我只是告诉你：问题就在这里。所以你自己要做的，是把那些段落找出来，仔细核对、查证一下。而如果他是正统派犹太人，他的希伯来文很可能比你好。所以谈到那些段落时，我不会跟他在那上面争辩；我会换个话题来谈。

关于他。

好的。不，我会的。我的意思是，换句话说，你——你还没准备好面对那个。所以就找别的方式去谈。这就够了。

是的，先生。哦，我也是这么想的。这里在东边（我想是指《钦定版》/King James）和《新英语译本》（New English）以及《耶路撒冷圣经》（Jerusalem Bible）。它们就排在一起，你从一段经文看到另一段、再到另一段。来回答关于译本的问题。

是的。问题是：如果你把不同译本放在一起比较，即便你不懂希伯来文或希腊文，这样是不是也有帮助？答案是：有帮助，但仍然不能完全克服那个问题。

我正要问布鲁斯一个问题。我很喜欢你用《钦定版》。

你用的是原封不动的《钦定版》吗？还是你自己稍微润色过？你用的到底是什么译本？

谢谢你，提姆。不，基本上是《钦定版》。有几处约翰福音的经文，用的是《新修订标准版》（New Revised Standard）。

而且偶尔会有一些词——有些十五世纪的词，比如……对，对，就像那个。那些词我不知道意思。我就想，嗯，我还是用一个新的译本吧。不过在一个半小时里我改的只有二三十个词左右。大部分还是《钦定版》。

你为什么用《钦定版》？你为什么选《钦定版》？

我用《钦定版》，因为我老板告诉我必须用。

谁？

他叫约翰·朱里（John Jury）。他是路易斯维尔“演员剧院”（Actor Theater, Louisville）的艺术总监。

那是一个正规的“演员权益协会”（Equity）的剧院。路易斯维尔的演员剧院是一个主要的地区性剧院，而且完全不是基督教背景的——相信我。这部作品也在百老汇演出过。正如我在引言里说的，那是他为复活节准备的献礼。

不过你看得到使用《钦定版》的优势吗？

嗯，你知道，《钦定版》写出来就是为了被朗读——作为讲台上的版本——因为当时很多人不识字。这跟莎士比亚是一样的。你知道，我是演员，我也演过不少莎士比亚。读起来很难，因为它是为“说出来”、为“演出来”而写的。

而且其实你想想看，这些（福音书）本来就是目击者的记述。所以最初，历史学家路加很可能是把这些当作口述证词收集来的。他也可能还有其他来源。但这就是目击者的记述。

所以，最初人们就是这样把这些事讲给别人听的。

你可以想象那个见证的人说：“我进了一个城，叫拿因。耶稣和许多门徒同在。有一具尸体正被抬出来。耶稣对那死人说了几句话，他就坐起来了。

他开始说话。耶稣把他交给他母亲。众人都惧怕……”你可以想象，耶稣当初的目击者把这事告诉路加时，绝不会是那种腔调：

“那时，在那些日子里，他下到名叫拿因的城……”

你知道，这段经文在教会里被“很糟糕地”念了三百年。人们——我也干过。

有个学生在佛罗里达那边写了一篇对这场演出的评论。他说：“我想给你看看我写的，布鲁斯。”他说：“布鲁斯·库恩把原本枯燥的材料……”我心想，等一下，这根本不是枯燥的材料。

我是说，枯干的手变得完好；这是死人复活；这——对吧？只是它也许被弄得太“神圣化”了，以至于听起来不那么鲜活。而它本来就是那样。

不过是的，我还会再回答几个问题。但我想说，你知道，我很喜欢他用《钦定版》（King James）。第一，它真是美得惊人。第二，《钦定版》大概在“早期被诠释”的时候更容易让人明白——不只是朗读，而是指早期对它的解释与传讲。我是说，当你真的自己读的时候，它呈现出来的样子、它给人的感觉，就更说得通。

我真的太喜欢了。现在我还能再接两三个问题。并且，耶稣自己说话也是这样的方式，对吧？就像有人谈到《钦定版圣经》时说：

“如果它对圣保罗来说够好，
那对我来说也够好。”

没错。好，继续。我再接几个。我们必须在 8:15 结束。

所以如果你们还能再待十分钟，我会——到那时我就会请大家散场。好，是你，请。

为了录音，有人刚刚称赞了布鲁斯·库恩，说那是一次精彩的演出——我只是把它记在案上。

现在，我提问之前有三点陈述必须先说。

我先把问题抛出来：耶稣的存在到底有多可靠、真实吗？——我接下来要用这几个陈述来铺垫：耶稣的存在到底有多可靠、真实吗？

好。为什么新约的书卷

旧约的书卷不也是由不同的四个人写成的吗？如果我们都能相信上帝借着摩西写了旧约，那么他为什么在旧约里会“换掉”那四个人呢？因此，我也能理解耶稣的存在。好，问题在于：新约的写作形式与旧约非常不同。

如果上帝写了旧约和新约，为什么它们会如此不同？好。答案是：正如耶稣既完全是人、也完全是神一样——他不是一半人一半神，而是百分之百的人、百分之百的神——圣经不只是一本神圣的书，它也是一本人的书；它不只是一本人的书，它也是一本神圣的书。

说它确实是“人的”，意思是写作者是在有意识地写作。他们用自己的个性、用自己的文化形式来写。这并不削弱这样的事实：所写的一切都是上帝所写的，每一个字都是上帝要写下的字。你可以把这两件事放在一起。若说既然上帝写了整本圣经，那么从头到尾都应该显出同一种文学形式或同一种个性，这是不对的。

主题在那里；真理彼此连贯一致。但事实是，比如路加对他写作的对象——提阿非罗——说：我写这份记述，因为我觉得这样做是好的。我想说的是：路加并不是有一天坐着坐着，突然手就自己动起来了。他不是说：“我——”然后拿起笔，惊呼：“天哪，这里发生了什么？”

也不是那种“自动书写”。他的个性，甚至他的缺点，他的文化，都在其中有所反映。这就是为什么你会看到：希伯来书的希腊文如此高雅，而约翰福音的希腊文几乎像在跟小孩子说话。因为——这正是圣经奇妙之处：它是一部彻彻底底的人类之书；然而，它又是一部彻彻底底、完全神圣之书。

所以，显明其神性的不是“形式”，而是内容与整体的一致性；不是形式。
