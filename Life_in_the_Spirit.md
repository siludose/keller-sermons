## English Transcript / 英文原文

Today Tim Keller is exploring how the Spirit calls us to faith, unites us together, equips  us with gifts and shapes us to be more like Christ. Our scripture tonight comes from the Book of Ephesians, chapter 5 verses 15 through 21. Be very careful then how you live, not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity  because the days are evil. Therefore, do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is. Do not get drunk on wine which leads to debauchery.

Instead, be filled with the Spirit. Speak to one another with Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord, always giving thanks to God the Father for everything  in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Submit to one another out of reverence, poor Christ. This is the Word of the Lord.

It's good to be with you back with you in order to look at this famous command by Paul. He commands us to be filled with the Spirit. He doesn't say it would be a great thing to attain if you could. Try real hard, maybe you'll make it. He commands, be filled with the Spirit.

And I think the best way to go with this subject is to be as practical as we possibly can. So let's ask the text, this short little text, three questions. What is being filled with the Spirit? How do we know if we are filled with the Spirit and how can we become filled with the Spirit? That's about as granular as I could make it.

What is being filled with the Spirit? How do we know if we are filled with the Spirit and how can we become filled with the Spirit? So first, what is being filled with the Spirit? And let's look right at the center, right at the heart of the command, where Paul makes  a comparison and a contrast. He says, don't be drunk with wine, but be filled with the Spirit.

By the way, most commentators say that's rather surprising. Why in the world that he brings getting drunk up? Why would he say, don't be drunk with wine, but be filled with the Spirit? And the answer is, there must be some way in which being drunk is like being filled with  the Spirit and some way in which it's unlike. There would be no need for a warning if there wasn't some similarity, but there also  would be no warrant for the warning if there wasn't a dissimilarity.

So let's ask that question, how is being drunk and being filled with the Spirit both  like and unlike? And here's how it's like. For in Acts chapter 2, Dave Pentecost, the first day that the Holy Spirit fell on the disciples,  and they began to speak, began to speak. The word of God, they began to talk about God and his wonders about the gospel, and they  did it with a boldness and with a joy and with a fluency that so impressed the crowd,  the onlookers, that they said, what? And they became filled with the Spirit, what did the people who were watching them say?

These guys are drunk. Why? Because they were so brave and so happy, and the only time they ever see people as brave  and as happy as people who are filled with the Spirit is people who are drunk. That's the reason why they looked at people who are filled with the Spirit so these guys  must be drunk. Why?

Well, alcohol gets rid of your inhibitions. The things that you're afraid of sort of melt away, and therefore there's a braveness  and there's a happiness that very often isn't there if you're sober. When I was a pastor in my first church, was a small town in the south. There was a town drunk. He actually had been raised at the church and most of the family were members of the church,  and I think he was a member of the church.

But he essentially lived on the street and nobody could get him to go into rehab. Nobody could get him to do what he really should do. But I remember when I first met him, he showed up at the church because this is his church  and I was the pastor. I didn't know who he was. I remember he sat down, and boy, I was impressed with him.

He didn't stagger, by the way. He said, I have done a lot of wrong things and he explained people he'd wrong, people he'd  robbed from, women that he had wronged, and he says, I'm going to go to that person to  make it right. I'm going to make that person make it right. He would say, he's talking to a pastor. I'm going to do all these things.

I'm going to make things right, and I'm ever saying, that's right, that's good. That wasn't long after that that I found out from the rest of my congregation since I was  brand new in town, that Carl only ever talked like that when he was drunk. He didn't stagger, so you couldn't tell right away unless you got up close and smelled  him. But he was saying the right things. He was willing to face the truth.

He was willing to tell the truth. But as soon as he sobered up immediately, no way. He wasn't going to do any of that stuff. All his fears rushed back and flooded him and kept him a slave. So being brave and being happy, evidently, is something that being drunk brings and also  something that the spirit brings.

However, being filled with the spirit and being drunk are very unlike, of course, of course. And here's how. Paul seems to intuit what we know today empirically. And that is that alcohol makes you brave and happy because it's a depressant. Did you know that?

You can go look it up. It's a chemical that actually is in the category of depressants. We say, well, if it's a depressant, how does it make you brave and happy? It depresses parts of the brain. So it diminishes brain function.

It diminishes brain ability so that a drunk person sees less of reality than you did before. And the things that we were afraid of and the things that were inhibiting you, they sort  of melt away. And then you're brave and happy. In other words, alcohol makes you brave and happy by depressing your brain and showing  you less of reality. But the fullness of the spirit operates in exactly the opposite way.

Look at verse 15, 16 and 17. Looking up to Paul's command to be filled with the spirit, he is saying to the Ephesian Christians,  he's saying, look at three things. He says, I want you to be wise. Verse 15. Not foolish.

He also says, I want you to be very careful in verse 15. But that literally means I want you to be intensely aware. It's a word that means, literally it says, I want you to walk circumspecly. It means I want you to be utterly and intensely aware of things around you. And then of course, it says, I want you to understand, understanding wisdom, intense awareness  of what's going on, Paul is seeking a higher level of mental functioning.

And where are we going to get that? Verse 18, be filled with the spirit. Because the fullness of the spirit, unlike alcohol, doesn't make you brave and happy, doesn't  make you joyful and courageous and joyful by showing you less of reality but by showing  you more. And let me give you a perfect concrete illustration of that. Elisha, the great prophet, 2 Kings chapter 6.

He was in a city with his servant, he had a servant. And the city was surrounded by enemies, enemy troops that were, it was an overwhelming  force that we're going to come upon the city tomorrow the next day. What Elisha was feeling okay? Elisha had confidence, Elisha had courage, Elisha had joy, and the servant is just melting  down with fear. And he says, how can you act like this, Elisha?

Now Elisha could have done two things to help the servant face that night and the next  day. One is he could have given him a bottle of alcohol, and he could have said, hey, go get drunk. Because that would have shown him less of reality and it would have enabled him, perhaps,  to face the future with a little more courage and a little more joy, but that's not what  he did. Oh no, what did Elisha do? He prayed to God and he said, oh Lord, open his eyes.

Show him all of reality, not just the material but the spiritual, the supernatural, show him  all of reality. And God opened his eyes, and in a very famous phrase, he saw chariots of fire on the mountains  around the city. In other words, he saw the hosts of God, he saw the angels, he saw the supernatural world. And he began to realize God is real and God is there and God is working a plan and God  has his power, and that's the fullness of the Spirit. The fullness of the Spirit is not giving you joy and courage by showing you less of reality  but by showing you more of reality, showing what God and what he's doing and his plans  and all that.

And therefore we're back to what we said at the very beginning of this series on the Holy  Spirit. We were in the summer when we were looking at chapters in the book of John, 14, 15,  16, where Jesus says, when the Holy Spirit comes, he will glorify me. He will take what I'm telling you, what I've done. He will take of mine and show it to you. The Holy Spirit's job is to take all the things that God is doing, all the things that God  has done in Christ, all the things that Christ has done for you, all the things that you  are in Christ.

And it makes the Holy Spirit's job is to take all that and to communicate it to you,  to make it so true to your mind, to the reason of your mind. And so real to the deepest emotions of your heart, that who God is and what He has done  and especially what He's done in Christ becomes the controlling power in your life. It dominates you. So the things that used to deflate you, don't deflate you, the things that used to inflate  you, don't scare you anymore, because you see all of reality. Alcohol is a depressant.

It gets rid of negative thoughts. It gets rid of fears by depressing parts of your brain, showing you less of reality. But here's what the fullness of the Spirit is. The fullness of the Spirit is not a frothy joy that helps you forget your troubles. No, in a very famous spot, C.S.

Lewis said, I didn't go to Christianity to make me happy. I always knew a bottle of port would do that. If you want to make yourself happy and comfortable, I don't recommend Christianity. The fullness of the Spirit does not give you a frothy joy to make you forget your troubles,  it gives you a heightened intense understanding of the truth and who God is and what He's doing  in the world that enables you to triumph over your troubles. The fullness of the Spirit is a supernaturally charged cognition,  which brings about a heart condition of courage and joy.

It's a heightened, intensified, existential moment-by-moment awareness of God in  a salvation that dominates your life so that nothing else does. So that no fears do. No danger does. Nothing does because you see all of reality. That's the fullness of the Spirit.

Now, secondly, how do you know if you have the fullness of the Spirit? What are the marks of a person who has it? Now, usually when people teach or preach on the being filled with the Spirit,  they start with verse 18. I rather deliberately included verses 15, 16, 17, their run-up. And the reason I did is because there you have Paul talking about wisdom  and then saying, now, if you want wisdom, be filled with the Spirit.

What I see in verses 15 all the way to 21 is the results of the fullness of the Spirit  is a kind of almost what looks to us like a contradiction. There is a humble realism along with a surging joy,  a humble realism along with a surging joy. So for example, wisdom, what is that? Now, you know, that's a huge subject, but at least we know this from the Bible. To be wisdom means to be down to earth, to be wise means to be realistic, not idealistic,  not naive, not having rosy colored glasses.

A wise person is savvy, a wise person knows how things work. A wise person knows what life is really like, reality, words and all. And look at the very end of the passage where it says,  submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. Submission means humble yourself before other people. Why?

Out of reverence, out of this sense of awe and reverence,  you have this humility before Christ. See, being filled with the Spirit rightly is associated with joy,  but we're also seeing that spiritual joy is accompanied by a humble realism. Paul says, in 2 Corinthians 6,  we're sorrowful yet always rejoicing. We're sorrowful yet always rejoicing, we're poor yet we possess everything. In other words, we're often sad but we're never really unhappy.

What is he talking about? The fullness of the Spirit brings you a joy based on God. It's a heightened understanding of God. It's a supernaturally charged cognition about God and His salvation. Whereas most of our, I don't know how to put it, the alternatives to being filled with the  Spirit is getting high, getting high on a drug, getting high on alcohol, or even getting high on  your own success.

When people say, I'm on a roll. I'm not thinking negative thoughts. I'm not thinking about my flaws. I'm thinking about my strengths, positive thinking. Get rid of negative thoughts.

That's not the fullness of the Spirit because the fullness of the  Spirit enhances realism. It enhances humility. The reason why you still have joy is because it's not looking at you and hey,  you're on a roll. It's looking at God, which means that the joy of the Holy Spirit is like the stars  because the stars get brighter and brighter as the night gets darker. And the joy that comes from the fullness of the Spirit goes hand in hand with a wisdom and a  realism and humility.

And it can get actually stronger that joy can get stronger as the circumstances  in your life get darker. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God. Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365-day devotional, the songs of Jesus, you'll find daily readings  through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a regular devotional practice,  this book is a wonderful way to start.

And if you already spend time and study in prayer,  then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest emotions and questions  before God and discover a new level of intimacy with Him. We'll send you Tim and Kathy Keller's  devotional as our thanks for your gift to help Gospel and Life share the love of Jesus with more  people. Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash give. That's gospelandlife.com slash give. So first there's a humble realism but then on the other hand, yes, there is this surging joy.

It's all here in 19 and 20. And since this is actually all one sentence in the Greek,  what you see in verses 19, 20 and 21 flow out of the command to be filled with the spirit. That's not as clear in the English because these are all broken into separate sentences. But you see, we're supposed to, let me work backwards. All a person filled with the spirit always  gives thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Boy, now there we go. Now you begin to see how you could possibly have a joy that gets like  the stars that gets brighter and stronger as the circumstances in your life get darker. Because here it says we must, a person filled with the spirit can always give thanks to God the Father  for everything. Now how is that possible? How is it possible to always have a grateful joy no  matter how bad things are?

And the answer is right at the very end in the name of Jesus. See, in the name, the word in the Bible name means your character. And when the Holy Spirit is filling you, when the Holy Spirit is coming and glorifying Jesus  and showing you what Jesus does, it drives you, the Holy Spirit, he drives you into the name  of Jesus, who he is and what he's done. And here's one of the things you will see. God hates evil.

If God did not hate evil, he would not have sent his only son. There's no reason why he would  ever send his only son to the world. He hates the evil. He hates the disease. He hates the  suffering and the death that's here.

He didn't make a world filled with these things. And yet  how does God bring about our salvation? How does he give us life? How does he bring us glory? By horrible things happening to Jesus Christ.

God brings death out of life. Part of me, he brings life  out of death. He brings glory out of suffering. He brings salvation out of rejection. All these  awful things.

It grieves God to see evil. And it has particularly grieved God to see evil fall in his  only son. And yet when the Holy Spirit, as the years go by, shows you more and more and more of the  genius of the cross, of the genius of what God has done and the wisdom of what has God has done on  the cross. And when you see how God brings more glory and more joy into the world because of the  suffering of Jesus when suffering hits you, you're going to start to say, I don't know what you're  doing, but I thank you. I know you're working.

And see, if you have that, if the Spirit has glorified  Jesus to the place where you can thank God, always in everything, then you become a person who  sings and makes music in your heart to the Lord. Actually, I love that verse. If you read right by  that, and it looks a little bit fru-fru, doesn't it kind of sing and make melody in your heart,  but however, notice it's not saying this is a person who's thinking about God, but who is communicating  to God. And I think this verse means this. The sing and make music in your heart to the Lord means.

This is a person who so has a sense of God's presence and such a delight in God's actual presence. That that person would put it into a song if he could. It's to live in the presence of God with such  delight that you would sing about it if you could. You'd put it into a song if you possibly could. Being filled with a Spirit means God is near.

Being filled with a Spirit means you sense the  nearness of God and you delight in the nearness of God and you would sing about it if you could,  and sometimes we sing about even though we can't. It sounds horrible to everybody,  probably even to God, but it doesn't matter. And of course being filled with a Spirit means,  therefore, that since we can thank God in all circumstances, and since we delight in His presence  moment by moment, we become people who speak to one another with Psalms and hymns and spiritual  songs. I actually preached an entire sermon on that two years ago, and I can't recap it now,  but that verse means not only that people fill with a Spirit, love music, and need to express  their joy in God through music, but it also is talking about singing to one another, not just singing  to God. And what that means is, Spirit filled people edify each other.

Spirit filled people are constantly  talking about what God is doing in their lives to one another and helping us find God in new ways  ourselves, because our friends around us are speaking to us about it. And the Spirit filled people  create an incredible kind of Christian community. So here it is, humble realism, along with the  searching joy. Is your joy like that? Do you have a joy like that?

It's like the stars. I think  it's brighter as the circumstances of your life get darker. Now if that's the fullness of the Spirit,  I doubt that there's anybody here who doesn't fall into one of two categories. Either you're either  going to say, I don't know anything of this at all, or you're going to say, I don't know nearly as much  of it as I want. So point three, how can we become filled with the Spirit?

Oh my. Let me just  let me take you to one place in the Bible that about 10 years ago hit me with all the force of a hammer. We tend not to think about Jesus as being filled with the Spirit, perhaps. Yes, we always know about  the baptism and the Spirit came down to annoy him for his ministry as baptism. But Jesus Christ  spends most of his time weeping.

He's always a man of sorrows. He's weeping over Lazarus. He's weeping  over Jerusalem. He's a man of sorrows. But there is an amazing spot.

It's related in Luke chapter 10  and also Matthew 11, where we're told Jesus exalted, exploded with joy in the Holy Spirit. Jesus has an experience of the fullness of the Spirit. And this is what it says. This is Luke chapter 10. He says, at that time, Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Ghost, exalted and said, I praise you,  Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the  learned and revealed them to little children.

Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure. Listen to it again. Jesus full of joy through the Holy Spirit exalted and said, I praise you, Father,  Lord of heaven and earth, for you have hidden these things from the wise and learned and revealed them  to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure. Jesus has an explosion of joy.

Why? It's very interesting. He's full of the Holy Spirit and the joy of the Holy Spirit. That's  what Paul's talking about here. How did it happen?

Here's how it happened. He's noticing something. First of all, we learn here that if you find God, it's not because you reach him or you attain him,  or you rise up toward him. Oh no, the only way anybody finds God is if God reveals himself,  if God unveils himself to you. But, who does he reveal himself to?

He doesn't reveal himself to the learned. He doesn't reveal himself to the people who are  wise in their own eyes. He doesn't reveal himself to the accomplished, to the people who say,  look at my accomplishments, look at my morality, look at my talent. He reveals himself to little  children at a spiritual phrase, of course, in Jesus, the helpless, the weak, the people who know  they've got nothing, the people who know they're spiritually bankrupt. So you know what Jesus is saying?

He's saying, I praise you, Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth because you're a God of grace. And you don't divide the world into the good and the bad. You divide the world into the proud and  the helpless. I praise you, Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth because you're a God of grace and you say  by grace not by works. And Jesus looked at the gospel.

He looked at grace and it filled him with  the Holy Spirit. Now look, Jesus is perfect. Jesus is right with God. Why would Jesus need the  fullness of the Holy Spirit? All I know is that even Jesus needed the fullness of the Holy Spirit  to get through his life, to face the things he was facing.

He literally had the whole  way to the world put on him, but he was able to bear it because he had the fullness of the Spirit. Well, how did he get it? He looked at grace. He looked at the gospel. Okay, look at this.

Let's do it right now. Psalm 51, David says to God, desperately,  do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Oh, Lord, do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Take not the Holy Spirit from me. Why?

Why was he afraid? Because he'd sinned  and see Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God is holy. And the Spirit of God cannot dwell with sin. And David knew that. And David knew that he was about to be abandoned.

He deserved to be abandoned  by the Spirit of God, with all of his joy, with all of his power. And that would have finished  David as a king. He just, take not the Holy Spirit from me. I deserve to have the Holy Spirit  taken from me, but take not the Holy Spirit from me. And guess what?

God did not take the Holy Spirit  from him. Holy Spirit stayed with him, even though he was a sinner, even though he deserved  abandonment. So there's this sinful David, says, take not the Holy Spirit from me, and God didn't. Centuries later, the ultimate David, the greater David, the descendant of David, the sinless Jesus  Christ, the true king, says, my God, my God, why has thou forsaken me? You know what he's saying?

He's saying, take not thy Holy Spirit from me. Take not thy face from me. Take not thy presence from  me. Don't take it away from me, but God did. Why?

You know, the sinful David deserved to lose the Holy  Spirit. The sinless, ultimate greater David did not deserve to lose the Holy Spirit, but the  sinful David kept the fullness of the Spirit and the sinless David, Jesus Christ lost the fullness  of the Spirit. Why? Because Jesus Christ was standing in our place and he was abandoned. He got the  abandonment that David deserved, that you and I deserve.

Why? So he lost the fullness of the Spirit  so you and I could have it even though we're sinners. Look at that. Look at that and say, I praise you,  Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you've saved me by grace. Are you bored?

Is there a  deadness in your heart right now? It's because you're forgetting grace. It's not real to your heart. Are you having trouble loving anybody? Are you feeling really, are you looking down at people?

Are you angry at people? It's because you've forgotten grace. It hasn't melted and humbled your  heart. Are you anxious? Are you afraid God's going to let you down?

It's because you've forgotten  grace. You've forgotten the fact that God was not going to abandon you. Look at what he's done for  you on the cross. Look at grace, grace, grace until there's an explosion of joy  to joy of the Holy Spirit. Do you want to be filled with the Spirit?

First, you have to be filled  with Christ. You have to become a little child. You have to rely on him alone for salvation. You have to stop saying, oh, Lord, please receive me because what I've done or who I am. You've  got to say, oh, Lord, please receive me just by grace because of what Jesus has done.

So in order to be filled with the Spirit, first, you have to be filled with Christ. But then,  you've got to take time. You've got to take time morning and evening and maybe in the middle of  the day. You've got to set aside time for you to look at the truth of the Bible. The truth of God  in general and the truth of the gospel in particular.

And study it and know it and meditate on it and  ask the Spirit to ignite it in you. There's no, listen, it's not like, oh, you have your doctrine in all  your truth, but I'm interested in mystical experience. No, the Holy Spirit, the experience, the spirit  is the truth on fire in your life. It's theology on fire in your life. And that takes study and that  takes prayer and that takes the means of grace and that takes the spiritual disciplines of prayer  and of worship, of study and of group prayer and of individual prayer and of corporate prayer.

I can't just drop in on church a couple of times a month and hope for some inspiration and expect  the fullness of the Spirit. Look at what Jesus Christ has done systematically, thematically  in a disciplined way until you can say, I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth that you are  God of grace and you've been a God of grace to me. Let's pray, our Father, we are so grateful that  you're a God of grace and you don't divide the world into the good and the bad but you divide  the world into the proud and the helpless. The people who don't think they need grace and the people  who do know that they need grace. And we thank you that you have been willing to come into our lives,  but we also know that we don't experience this humble realism in searching joy, this heightened  supernaturally charged cognition.

We have not made ourselves available to it and we ask that  your Holy Spirit would fill us. Fill us. And that we go on being filled with your Spirit  so that we also can become a congregation of people who sing to one another and speak to one  another and build each other up in love. So, Father, help us to apply all these things through the  inspiration of your Holy Spirit in the name of Jesus we ask it. Amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

Today Tim Keller is exploring how the Spirit calls us to faith, unites us together, equips  us with gifts and shapes us to be more like Christ. Our scripture tonight comes from the Book of Ephesians, chapter 5 verses 15 through 21. Be very careful then how you live, not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity  because the days are evil. Therefore, do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is. Do not get drunk on wine which leads to debauchery.

Instead, be filled with the Spirit. Speak to one another with Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord, always giving thanks to God the Father for everything  in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Submit to one another out of reverence, poor Christ. This is the Word of the Lord.

It's good to be with you back with you in order to look at this famous command by Paul. He commands us to be filled with the Spirit. He doesn't say it would be a great thing to attain if you could. Try real hard, maybe you'll make it. He commands, be filled with the Spirit.

And I think the best way to go with this subject is to be as practical as we possibly can. So let's ask the text, this short little text, three questions. What is being filled with the Spirit? How do we know if we are filled with the Spirit and how can we become filled with the Spirit? That's about as granular as I could make it.

What is being filled with the Spirit? How do we know if we are filled with the Spirit and how can we become filled with the Spirit? So first, what is being filled with the Spirit? And let's look right at the center, right at the heart of the command, where Paul makes  a comparison and a contrast. He says, don't be drunk with wine, but be filled with the Spirit.

By the way, most commentators say that's rather surprising. Why in the world that he brings getting drunk up? Why would he say, don't be drunk with wine, but be filled with the Spirit? And the answer is, there must be some way in which being drunk is like being filled with  the Spirit and some way in which it's unlike. There would be no need for a warning if there wasn't some similarity, but there also  would be no warrant for the warning if there wasn't a dissimilarity.

So let's ask that question, how is being drunk and being filled with the Spirit both  like and unlike? And here's how it's like. For in Acts chapter 2, Dave Pentecost, the first day that the Holy Spirit fell on the disciples,  and they began to speak, began to speak. The word of God, they began to talk about God and his wonders about the gospel, and they  did it with a boldness and with a joy and with a fluency that so impressed the crowd,  the onlookers, that they said, what? And they became filled with the Spirit, what did the people who were watching them say?

These guys are drunk. Why? Because they were so brave and so happy, and the only time they ever see people as brave  and as happy as people who are filled with the Spirit is people who are drunk. That's the reason why they looked at people who are filled with the Spirit so these guys  must be drunk. Why?

Well, alcohol gets rid of your inhibitions. The things that you're afraid of sort of melt away, and therefore there's a braveness  and there's a happiness that very often isn't there if you're sober. When I was a pastor in my first church, was a small town in the south. There was a town drunk. He actually had been raised at the church and most of the family were members of the church,  and I think he was a member of the church.

But he essentially lived on the street and nobody could get him to go into rehab. Nobody could get him to do what he really should do. But I remember when I first met him, he showed up at the church because this is his church  and I was the pastor. I didn't know who he was. I remember he sat down, and boy, I was impressed with him.

He didn't stagger, by the way. He said, I have done a lot of wrong things and he explained people he'd wrong, people he'd  robbed from, women that he had wronged, and he says, I'm going to go to that person to  make it right. I'm going to make that person make it right. He would say, he's talking to a pastor. I'm going to do all these things.

I'm going to make things right, and I'm ever saying, that's right, that's good. That wasn't long after that that I found out from the rest of my congregation since I was  brand new in town, that Carl only ever talked like that when he was drunk. He didn't stagger, so you couldn't tell right away unless you got up close and smelled  him. But he was saying the right things. He was willing to face the truth.

He was willing to tell the truth. But as soon as he sobered up immediately, no way. He wasn't going to do any of that stuff. All his fears rushed back and flooded him and kept him a slave. So being brave and being happy, evidently, is something that being drunk brings and also  something that the spirit brings.

However, being filled with the spirit and being drunk are very unlike, of course, of course. And here's how. Paul seems to intuit what we know today empirically. And that is that alcohol makes you brave and happy because it's a depressant. Did you know that?

You can go look it up. It's a chemical that actually is in the category of depressants. We say, well, if it's a depressant, how does it make you brave and happy? It depresses parts of the brain. So it diminishes brain function.

It diminishes brain ability so that a drunk person sees less of reality than you did before. And the things that we were afraid of and the things that were inhibiting you, they sort  of melt away. And then you're brave and happy. In other words, alcohol makes you brave and happy by depressing your brain and showing  you less of reality. But the fullness of the spirit operates in exactly the opposite way.

Look at verse 15, 16 and 17. Looking up to Paul's command to be filled with the spirit, he is saying to the Ephesian Christians,  he's saying, look at three things. He says, I want you to be wise. Verse 15. Not foolish.

He also says, I want you to be very careful in verse 15. But that literally means I want you to be intensely aware. It's a word that means, literally it says, I want you to walk circumspecly. It means I want you to be utterly and intensely aware of things around you. And then of course, it says, I want you to understand, understanding wisdom, intense awareness  of what's going on, Paul is seeking a higher level of mental functioning.

And where are we going to get that? Verse 18, be filled with the spirit. Because the fullness of the spirit, unlike alcohol, doesn't make you brave and happy, doesn't  make you joyful and courageous and joyful by showing you less of reality but by showing  you more. And let me give you a perfect concrete illustration of that. Elisha, the great prophet, 2 Kings chapter 6.

He was in a city with his servant, he had a servant. And the city was surrounded by enemies, enemy troops that were, it was an overwhelming  force that we're going to come upon the city tomorrow the next day. What Elisha was feeling okay? Elisha had confidence, Elisha had courage, Elisha had joy, and the servant is just melting  down with fear. And he says, how can you act like this, Elisha?

Now Elisha could have done two things to help the servant face that night and the next  day. One is he could have given him a bottle of alcohol, and he could have said, hey, go get drunk. Because that would have shown him less of reality and it would have enabled him, perhaps,  to face the future with a little more courage and a little more joy, but that's not what  he did. Oh no, what did Elisha do? He prayed to God and he said, oh Lord, open his eyes.

Show him all of reality, not just the material but the spiritual, the supernatural, show him  all of reality. And God opened his eyes, and in a very famous phrase, he saw chariots of fire on the mountains  around the city. In other words, he saw the hosts of God, he saw the angels, he saw the supernatural world. And he began to realize God is real and God is there and God is working a plan and God  has his power, and that's the fullness of the Spirit. The fullness of the Spirit is not giving you joy and courage by showing you less of reality  but by showing you more of reality, showing what God and what he's doing and his plans  and all that.

And therefore we're back to what we said at the very beginning of this series on the Holy  Spirit. We were in the summer when we were looking at chapters in the book of John, 14, 15,  16, where Jesus says, when the Holy Spirit comes, he will glorify me. He will take what I'm telling you, what I've done. He will take of mine and show it to you. The Holy Spirit's job is to take all the things that God is doing, all the things that God  has done in Christ, all the things that Christ has done for you, all the things that you  are in Christ.

And it makes the Holy Spirit's job is to take all that and to communicate it to you,  to make it so true to your mind, to the reason of your mind. And so real to the deepest emotions of your heart, that who God is and what He has done  and especially what He's done in Christ becomes the controlling power in your life. It dominates you. So the things that used to deflate you, don't deflate you, the things that used to inflate  you, don't scare you anymore, because you see all of reality. Alcohol is a depressant.

It gets rid of negative thoughts. It gets rid of fears by depressing parts of your brain, showing you less of reality. But here's what the fullness of the Spirit is. The fullness of the Spirit is not a frothy joy that helps you forget your troubles. No, in a very famous spot, C.S.

Lewis said, I didn't go to Christianity to make me happy. I always knew a bottle of port would do that. If you want to make yourself happy and comfortable, I don't recommend Christianity. The fullness of the Spirit does not give you a frothy joy to make you forget your troubles,  it gives you a heightened intense understanding of the truth and who God is and what He's doing  in the world that enables you to triumph over your troubles. The fullness of the Spirit is a supernaturally charged cognition,  which brings about a heart condition of courage and joy.

It's a heightened, intensified, existential moment-by-moment awareness of God in  a salvation that dominates your life so that nothing else does. So that no fears do. No danger does. Nothing does because you see all of reality. That's the fullness of the Spirit.

Now, secondly, how do you know if you have the fullness of the Spirit? What are the marks of a person who has it? Now, usually when people teach or preach on the being filled with the Spirit,  they start with verse 18. I rather deliberately included verses 15, 16, 17, their run-up. And the reason I did is because there you have Paul talking about wisdom  and then saying, now, if you want wisdom, be filled with the Spirit.

What I see in verses 15 all the way to 21 is the results of the fullness of the Spirit  is a kind of almost what looks to us like a contradiction. There is a humble realism along with a surging joy,  a humble realism along with a surging joy. So for example, wisdom, what is that? Now, you know, that's a huge subject, but at least we know this from the Bible. To be wisdom means to be down to earth, to be wise means to be realistic, not idealistic,  not naive, not having rosy colored glasses.

A wise person is savvy, a wise person knows how things work. A wise person knows what life is really like, reality, words and all. And look at the very end of the passage where it says,  submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. Submission means humble yourself before other people. Why?

Out of reverence, out of this sense of awe and reverence,  you have this humility before Christ. See, being filled with the Spirit rightly is associated with joy,  but we're also seeing that spiritual joy is accompanied by a humble realism. Paul says, in 2 Corinthians 6,  we're sorrowful yet always rejoicing. We're sorrowful yet always rejoicing, we're poor yet we possess everything. In other words, we're often sad but we're never really unhappy.

What is he talking about? The fullness of the Spirit brings you a joy based on God. It's a heightened understanding of God. It's a supernaturally charged cognition about God and His salvation. Whereas most of our, I don't know how to put it, the alternatives to being filled with the  Spirit is getting high, getting high on a drug, getting high on alcohol, or even getting high on  your own success.

When people say, I'm on a roll. I'm not thinking negative thoughts. I'm not thinking about my flaws. I'm thinking about my strengths, positive thinking. Get rid of negative thoughts.

That's not the fullness of the Spirit because the fullness of the  Spirit enhances realism. It enhances humility. The reason why you still have joy is because it's not looking at you and hey,  you're on a roll. It's looking at God, which means that the joy of the Holy Spirit is like the stars  because the stars get brighter and brighter as the night gets darker. And the joy that comes from the fullness of the Spirit goes hand in hand with a wisdom and a  realism and humility.

And it can get actually stronger that joy can get stronger as the circumstances  in your life get darker. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God. Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365-day devotional, the songs of Jesus, you'll find daily readings  through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a regular devotional practice,  this book is a wonderful way to start.

And if you already spend time and study in prayer,  then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest emotions and questions  before God and discover a new level of intimacy with Him. We'll send you Tim and Kathy Keller's  devotional as our thanks for your gift to help Gospel and Life share the love of Jesus with more  people. Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash give. That's gospelandlife.com slash give. So first there's a humble realism but then on the other hand, yes, there is this surging joy.

It's all here in 19 and 20. And since this is actually all one sentence in the Greek,  what you see in verses 19, 20 and 21 flow out of the command to be filled with the spirit. That's not as clear in the English because these are all broken into separate sentences. But you see, we're supposed to, let me work backwards. All a person filled with the spirit always  gives thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Boy, now there we go. Now you begin to see how you could possibly have a joy that gets like  the stars that gets brighter and stronger as the circumstances in your life get darker. Because here it says we must, a person filled with the spirit can always give thanks to God the Father  for everything. Now how is that possible? How is it possible to always have a grateful joy no  matter how bad things are?

And the answer is right at the very end in the name of Jesus. See, in the name, the word in the Bible name means your character. And when the Holy Spirit is filling you, when the Holy Spirit is coming and glorifying Jesus  and showing you what Jesus does, it drives you, the Holy Spirit, he drives you into the name  of Jesus, who he is and what he's done. And here's one of the things you will see. God hates evil.

If God did not hate evil, he would not have sent his only son. There's no reason why he would  ever send his only son to the world. He hates the evil. He hates the disease. He hates the  suffering and the death that's here.

He didn't make a world filled with these things. And yet  how does God bring about our salvation? How does he give us life? How does he bring us glory? By horrible things happening to Jesus Christ.

God brings death out of life. Part of me, he brings life  out of death. He brings glory out of suffering. He brings salvation out of rejection. All these  awful things.

It grieves God to see evil. And it has particularly grieved God to see evil fall in his  only son. And yet when the Holy Spirit, as the years go by, shows you more and more and more of the  genius of the cross, of the genius of what God has done and the wisdom of what has God has done on  the cross. And when you see how God brings more glory and more joy into the world because of the  suffering of Jesus when suffering hits you, you're going to start to say, I don't know what you're  doing, but I thank you. I know you're working.

And see, if you have that, if the Spirit has glorified  Jesus to the place where you can thank God, always in everything, then you become a person who  sings and makes music in your heart to the Lord. Actually, I love that verse. If you read right by  that, and it looks a little bit fru-fru, doesn't it kind of sing and make melody in your heart,  but however, notice it's not saying this is a person who's thinking about God, but who is communicating  to God. And I think this verse means this. The sing and make music in your heart to the Lord means.

This is a person who so has a sense of God's presence and such a delight in God's actual presence. That that person would put it into a song if he could. It's to live in the presence of God with such  delight that you would sing about it if you could. You'd put it into a song if you possibly could. Being filled with a Spirit means God is near.

Being filled with a Spirit means you sense the  nearness of God and you delight in the nearness of God and you would sing about it if you could,  and sometimes we sing about even though we can't. It sounds horrible to everybody,  probably even to God, but it doesn't matter. And of course being filled with a Spirit means,  therefore, that since we can thank God in all circumstances, and since we delight in His presence  moment by moment, we become people who speak to one another with Psalms and hymns and spiritual  songs. I actually preached an entire sermon on that two years ago, and I can't recap it now,  but that verse means not only that people fill with a Spirit, love music, and need to express  their joy in God through music, but it also is talking about singing to one another, not just singing  to God. And what that means is, Spirit filled people edify each other.

Spirit filled people are constantly  talking about what God is doing in their lives to one another and helping us find God in new ways  ourselves, because our friends around us are speaking to us about it. And the Spirit filled people  create an incredible kind of Christian community. So here it is, humble realism, along with the  searching joy. Is your joy like that? Do you have a joy like that?

It's like the stars. I think  it's brighter as the circumstances of your life get darker. Now if that's the fullness of the Spirit,  I doubt that there's anybody here who doesn't fall into one of two categories. Either you're either  going to say, I don't know anything of this at all, or you're going to say, I don't know nearly as much  of it as I want. So point three, how can we become filled with the Spirit?

Oh my. Let me just  let me take you to one place in the Bible that about 10 years ago hit me with all the force of a hammer. We tend not to think about Jesus as being filled with the Spirit, perhaps. Yes, we always know about  the baptism and the Spirit came down to annoy him for his ministry as baptism. But Jesus Christ  spends most of his time weeping.

He's always a man of sorrows. He's weeping over Lazarus. He's weeping  over Jerusalem. He's a man of sorrows. But there is an amazing spot.

It's related in Luke chapter 10  and also Matthew 11, where we're told Jesus exalted, exploded with joy in the Holy Spirit. Jesus has an experience of the fullness of the Spirit. And this is what it says. This is Luke chapter 10. He says, at that time, Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Ghost, exalted and said, I praise you,  Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the  learned and revealed them to little children.

Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure. Listen to it again. Jesus full of joy through the Holy Spirit exalted and said, I praise you, Father,  Lord of heaven and earth, for you have hidden these things from the wise and learned and revealed them  to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure. Jesus has an explosion of joy.

Why? It's very interesting. He's full of the Holy Spirit and the joy of the Holy Spirit. That's  what Paul's talking about here. How did it happen?

Here's how it happened. He's noticing something. First of all, we learn here that if you find God, it's not because you reach him or you attain him,  or you rise up toward him. Oh no, the only way anybody finds God is if God reveals himself,  if God unveils himself to you. But, who does he reveal himself to?

He doesn't reveal himself to the learned. He doesn't reveal himself to the people who are  wise in their own eyes. He doesn't reveal himself to the accomplished, to the people who say,  look at my accomplishments, look at my morality, look at my talent. He reveals himself to little  children at a spiritual phrase, of course, in Jesus, the helpless, the weak, the people who know  they've got nothing, the people who know they're spiritually bankrupt. So you know what Jesus is saying?

He's saying, I praise you, Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth because you're a God of grace. And you don't divide the world into the good and the bad. You divide the world into the proud and  the helpless. I praise you, Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth because you're a God of grace and you say  by grace not by works. And Jesus looked at the gospel.

He looked at grace and it filled him with  the Holy Spirit. Now look, Jesus is perfect. Jesus is right with God. Why would Jesus need the  fullness of the Holy Spirit? All I know is that even Jesus needed the fullness of the Holy Spirit  to get through his life, to face the things he was facing.

He literally had the whole  way to the world put on him, but he was able to bear it because he had the fullness of the Spirit. Well, how did he get it? He looked at grace. He looked at the gospel. Okay, look at this.

Let's do it right now. Psalm 51, David says to God, desperately,  do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Oh, Lord, do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Take not the Holy Spirit from me. Why?

Why was he afraid? Because he'd sinned  and see Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God is holy. And the Spirit of God cannot dwell with sin. And David knew that. And David knew that he was about to be abandoned.

He deserved to be abandoned  by the Spirit of God, with all of his joy, with all of his power. And that would have finished  David as a king. He just, take not the Holy Spirit from me. I deserve to have the Holy Spirit  taken from me, but take not the Holy Spirit from me. And guess what?

God did not take the Holy Spirit  from him. Holy Spirit stayed with him, even though he was a sinner, even though he deserved  abandonment. So there's this sinful David, says, take not the Holy Spirit from me, and God didn't. Centuries later, the ultimate David, the greater David, the descendant of David, the sinless Jesus  Christ, the true king, says, my God, my God, why has thou forsaken me? You know what he's saying?

He's saying, take not thy Holy Spirit from me. Take not thy face from me. Take not thy presence from  me. Don't take it away from me, but God did. Why?

You know, the sinful David deserved to lose the Holy  Spirit. The sinless, ultimate greater David did not deserve to lose the Holy Spirit, but the  sinful David kept the fullness of the Spirit and the sinless David, Jesus Christ lost the fullness  of the Spirit. Why? Because Jesus Christ was standing in our place and he was abandoned. He got the  abandonment that David deserved, that you and I deserve.

Why? So he lost the fullness of the Spirit  so you and I could have it even though we're sinners. Look at that. Look at that and say, I praise you,  Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you've saved me by grace. Are you bored?

Is there a  deadness in your heart right now? It's because you're forgetting grace. It's not real to your heart. Are you having trouble loving anybody? Are you feeling really, are you looking down at people?

Are you angry at people? It's because you've forgotten grace. It hasn't melted and humbled your  heart. Are you anxious? Are you afraid God's going to let you down?

It's because you've forgotten  grace. You've forgotten the fact that God was not going to abandon you. Look at what he's done for  you on the cross. Look at grace, grace, grace until there's an explosion of joy  to joy of the Holy Spirit. Do you want to be filled with the Spirit?

First, you have to be filled  with Christ. You have to become a little child. You have to rely on him alone for salvation. You have to stop saying, oh, Lord, please receive me because what I've done or who I am. You've  got to say, oh, Lord, please receive me just by grace because of what Jesus has done.

So in order to be filled with the Spirit, first, you have to be filled with Christ. But then,  you've got to take time. You've got to take time morning and evening and maybe in the middle of  the day. You've got to set aside time for you to look at the truth of the Bible. The truth of God  in general and the truth of the gospel in particular.

And study it and know it and meditate on it and  ask the Spirit to ignite it in you. There's no, listen, it's not like, oh, you have your doctrine in all  your truth, but I'm interested in mystical experience. No, the Holy Spirit, the experience, the spirit  is the truth on fire in your life. It's theology on fire in your life. And that takes study and that  takes prayer and that takes the means of grace and that takes the spiritual disciplines of prayer  and of worship, of study and of group prayer and of individual prayer and of corporate prayer.

I can't just drop in on church a couple of times a month and hope for some inspiration and expect  the fullness of the Spirit. Look at what Jesus Christ has done systematically, thematically  in a disciplined way until you can say, I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth that you are  God of grace and you've been a God of grace to me. Let's pray, our Father, we are so grateful that  you're a God of grace and you don't divide the world into the good and the bad but you divide  the world into the proud and the helpless. The people who don't think they need grace and the people  who do know that they need grace. And we thank you that you have been willing to come into our lives,  but we also know that we don't experience this humble realism in searching joy, this heightened  supernaturally charged cognition.

We have not made ourselves available to it and we ask that  your Holy Spirit would fill us. Fill us. And that we go on being filled with your Spirit  so that we also can become a congregation of people who sing to one another and speak to one  another and build each other up in love. So, Father, help us to apply all these things through the  inspiration of your Holy Spirit in the name of Jesus we ask it. Amen.

### 中文翻译

今天，Tim Keller探讨圣灵如何呼召我们信仰、将我们联合在一起、用恩赐装备我们，并塑造我们更像基督。今晚的经文来自以弗所书第五章第15至21节：

> 你们要谨慎行事，不要像愚昧人，当像智慧人。要爱惜光阴，因为现今的世代邪恶。不要作糊涂人，要明白主的旨意如何。不要醉酒，酒能使人放荡，乃要被圣灵充满。当用诗章、颂词、灵歌彼此对说，口唱心和地赞美主。凡事要奉我们主耶稣基督的名常常感谢父神。又当存敬畏基督的心，彼此顺服。

这是主的话语。

很高兴能和你们一起来看保罗这个著名的命令。他命令我们要被圣灵充满。他没有说这是一件如果你能达到就很好的事，努力尝试，也许你能做到。他命令说：要被圣灵充满。

我认为处理这个主题最好的方式是尽可能地实际。让我们向这段简短的经文提出三个问题：什么是被圣灵充满？我们如何知道自己是否被圣灵充满？我们如何能被圣灵充满？这是我能做到的最细致的划分了。

什么是被圣灵充满？我们如何知道自己是否被圣灵充满？我们如何能被圣灵充满？

### 第一，什么是被圣灵充满？

让我们直接看这命令的核心，保罗在那里做了一个比较和对比。他说：不要醉酒，乃要被圣灵充满。顺便说一下，大多数注释家说这相当令人惊讶。他为什么要提到醉酒？为什么他说不要醉酒，乃要被圣灵充满？答案是，醉酒和被圣灵充满在某种程度上是相似的，在某种程度上又是不同的。如果没有某种相似性，就不需要这样的警告；但如果没有不同之处，这警告也没有根据。

那么让我们问这个问题：醉酒和被圣灵充满有什么相似和不同之处？

相似之处是这样的。在使徒行传第二章，五旬节那天，圣灵第一次降临在门徒身上，他们开始说话。他们开始讲说神的话语，谈论神和他的奇妙作为，谈论福音，而且他们是带着勇气、喜乐和流利说出来的，给旁观者留下了深刻印象。那些看着他们的人说什么？当他们被圣灵充满时，观看的人说什么？这些人醉了。为什么？因为他们如此勇敢、如此快乐，而人们唯一见过像被圣灵充满的人那样勇敢快乐的，就是喝醉的人。这就是为什么他们看着被圣灵充满的人说：这些人一定是醉了。为什么？

因为酒精消除了你的抑制。你害怕的事情似乎融化了，因此就有了一种勇气和快乐，这在清醒时往往是没有的。当我在第一间教会做牧师时，那是南方的一个小镇，有一个镇上的酒鬼。他实际上是在教会长大的，他的大部分家人都是教会成员，我想他也是教会成员。但他基本上住在街上，没有人能让他去戒酒。没有人能让他做他真正应该做的事。但我记得第一次见到他时，他来到教会，因为这是他的教会，而我是牧师。我不知道他是谁。我记得他坐下来，我对他印象深刻。顺便说一下，他没有踉跄。他说：我做了很多错事。他解释了他伤害过的人，他偷过的人，他伤害过的女人。他说：我要去找那个人把事情弄对。我要和那个人把事情弄对。他会说，他在和牧师说话：我要做所有这些事。我要把事情弄对。我一直说：没错，很好。

不久之后，我从我的会众那里得知——因为我是镇上的新人——卡尔只有在喝醉的时候才会这样说话。他没有踉跄，所以你不能马上看出来，除非你靠近闻到他身上的味道。但他说的是正确的话。他愿意面对真相。他愿意说出真相。但一旦他清醒过来，就完全不一样了。他不会做任何那些事。所有的恐惧都涌回来淹没了他，使他成为奴隶。

所以勇敢和快乐，显然，是醉酒带来的，也是圣灵带来的。

然而，被圣灵充满和醉酒当然非常不同。以下是不同之处。保罗似乎凭直觉知道我们今天通过经验知道的事情，那就是酒精让你勇敢快乐是因为它是一种抑制剂。你知道吗？你可以去查一下。它是一种实际上属于抑制剂类别的化学物质。我们说，既然是抑制剂，怎么会让你勇敢快乐呢？它抑制大脑的某些部分。所以它减少大脑功能。它减少大脑能力，以至于醉酒的人看到的现实比以前少。那些让我们害怕的事情和抑制我们的事情似乎融化了。然后你就勇敢快乐了。换句话说，酒精通过抑制你的大脑、让你看到更少的现实来使你勇敢快乐。

但圣灵的充满以完全相反的方式运作。看第15、16和17节。在保罗命令被圣灵充满之前，他对以弗所的基督徒说，他说：看这三件事。他说：我要你们有智慧。第15节。不要愚昧。他还说：我要你们非常谨慎。第15节。但那字面意思是我要你们极度警觉。这是一个词，字面意思是说：我要你们谨慎行事。意思是我要你们对周围的事物完全和强烈地意识到。然后当然，它说：我要你们明白。明白、智慧、对正在发生的事情的强烈意识——保罗在寻求更高水平的心智功能。

我们从哪里得到这些？第18节：要被圣灵充满。因为圣灵的充满，不像酒精，不是通过让你看到更少的现实来使你勇敢快乐和喜悦有勇气，而是通过让你看到更多的现实。

让我给你一个完美的具体例证。以利沙，伟大的先知，列王纪下第六章。他和他的仆人在一座城里。城被敌军包围，是一支压倒性的力量，第二天就要攻打这城。以利沙感觉还好？以利沙有信心，以利沙有勇气，以利沙有喜乐，而仆人因恐惧而崩溃。他说：以利沙，你怎么能这样？

以利沙可以做两件事来帮助仆人面对那个夜晚和第二天。一是他可以给他一瓶酒，说：嘿，去喝醉吧。因为那会让他看到更少的现实，可能让他以更多的勇气和喜乐面对未来，但那不是他做的。不，以利沙做了什么？他向神祷告说：主啊，求你开他的眼睛。让他看到所有的现实，不仅是物质的，还有属灵的、超自然的，让他看到所有的现实。神开了他的眼睛，在一个非常著名的短语中，他看到火焰的战车在城周围的山上。换句话说，他看到了神的天军，他看到了天使，他看到了超自然的世界。他开始意识到神是真实的，神在那里，神在实施一个计划，神有他的能力。这就是圣灵的充满。

圣灵的充满不是通过让你看到更少的现实来给你喜乐和勇气，而是通过让你看到更多的现实，看到神是谁，他在做什么，他的计划等等。

因此我们回到这个系列一开始所说的关于圣灵的话。夏天的时候我们在看约翰福音14、15、16章，耶稣在那里说：当圣灵来的时候，他要荣耀我。他要把我告诉你们的事，我所做的事取来。他要把属我的东西取来给你们看。圣灵的工作是把神正在做的一切事，神在基督里所做的一切事，基督为你所做的一切事，你在基督里所是的一切——圣灵的工作是把所有这些传达给你，使它对你的头脑、你的理性如此真实，对你心灵最深处的情感如此真实，以至于神是谁、他所做的事、特别是他在基督里所做的事成为你生命中的掌控力量。它支配着你。所以那些曾经让你沮丧的事情不再让你沮丧，那些曾经让你害怕的事情不再让你害怕，因为你看到了所有的现实。

酒精是一种抑制剂。它通过抑制大脑的某些部分、让你看到更少的现实来消除负面思想和恐惧。但圣灵的充满是什么呢？圣灵的充满不是让你忘记烦恼的肤浅喜乐。不，在一个非常著名的地方，C.S.路易斯说：我不是为了让自己快乐才信基督教的。我一直知道一瓶波特酒就能做到这一点。如果你想让自己快乐舒适，我不推荐基督教。圣灵的充满不是给你肤浅的喜乐让你忘记烦恼，而是给你对真理、对神是谁、对他在世界上所做之事的高度强烈的理解，使你能够战胜你的烦恼。

圣灵的充满是一种超自然充能的认知，它带来勇气和喜乐的心灵状态。它是对神和救恩的高度、强化、存在性的时时刻刻的意识，支配着你的生命，以至于没有其他东西能支配你。没有恐惧能支配你。没有危险能支配你。什么都不能，因为你看到了所有的现实。这就是圣灵的充满。

### 第二，你如何知道自己有圣灵的充满？拥有它的人的标志是什么？

通常当人们教导或讲道关于被圣灵充满时，他们从第18节开始。我特意包括了第15、16、17节的引言。我这样做的原因是因为在那里保罗谈到智慧，然后说：如果你想要智慧，就要被圣灵充满。

我在第15节到第21节中看到的是，圣灵充满的结果是一种看起来像矛盾的东西。有谦卑的现实主义和涌动的喜乐并存——谦卑的现实主义和涌动的喜乐。

例如，智慧是什么？这是一个巨大的主题，但至少我们从圣经知道这一点。智慧意味着脚踏实地，有智慧意味着现实主义，不是理想主义，不是天真，不是戴着玫瑰色眼镜。有智慧的人是精明的，有智慧的人知道事情是如何运作的。有智慧的人知道生活真正是什么样子的，现实，包括疣和一切。

再看这段经文的最后，它说：当存敬畏基督的心彼此顺服。顺服意味着在别人面前谦卑自己。为什么？出于敬畏，出于这种敬畏感，你对基督有这种谦卑。看，被圣灵充满正确地与喜乐联系在一起，但我们也看到属灵的喜乐伴随着谦卑的现实主义。

保罗在哥林多后书第六章说：似乎忧愁，却是常常快乐的；似乎贫穷，却是叫许多人富足的。换句话说，我们常常悲伤，但我们从不真正不快乐。他在说什么？圣灵的充满给你一种基于神的喜乐。它是对神的高度理解。它是关于神和他救恩的超自然充能的认知。而我们大多数的，我不知道怎么说，被圣灵充满的替代品是"嗨"起来——用毒品"嗨"起来，用酒精"嗨"起来，甚至用你自己的成功"嗨"起来。当人们说：我正在顺风顺水。我没有想负面的事情。我没有想我的缺点。我在想我的优点，积极思考。摆脱负面思想。那不是圣灵的充满，因为圣灵的充满增强现实主义。它增强谦卑。

你仍然有喜乐的原因是因为它不是看着你说：嘿，你正在顺风顺水。它是看着神，这意味着圣灵的喜乐就像星星，因为夜越暗星星越亮。来自圣灵充满的喜乐与智慧、现实主义和谦卑并行。当你生活中的环境变得更黑暗时，那喜乐实际上可以变得更强。

诗篇可以深刻地塑造你亲近神的方式。甚至耶稣也依靠诗篇来面对每一种情况，包括死亡。在Tim和Kathy Keller的365天灵修书《耶稣之歌》中，你会发现每天通过诗篇的阅读，带有新鲜的圣经洞见。如果你没有固定的灵修习惯，这本书是一个很好的开始方式。如果你已经花时间学习和祷告，那么阅读和祷告诗篇可以帮助你把最深的情感和问题带到神面前，发现与他更深层次的亲密关系。我们会寄给你Tim和Kathy Keller的灵修书，作为你帮助Gospel in Life与更多人分享耶稣之爱的礼物的感谢。今天就在gospelonlife.com/give申请你的副本。

所以首先有谦卑的现实主义，但另一方面，是的，有这涌动的喜乐。都在第19和20节。既然这在希腊文中实际上是一个句子，你在第19、20和21节中看到的是从被圣灵充满的命令中流出来的。这在英文中不那么清楚，因为这些都被分成单独的句子了。

但你看，我们应该这样——让我倒着讲。被圣灵充满的人总是奉我们主耶稣基督的名，凡事感谢父神。哇，现在你开始看到你怎么可能有一种像星星一样的喜乐，当你生活中的环境变得更黑暗时变得更亮更强。因为这里说我们必须，被圣灵充满的人可以凡事常常感谢父神。这怎么可能？无论事情多糟糕，怎么可能总是有感恩的喜乐？

答案就在最后：奉耶稣的名。看，在圣经中"名"这个词意味着你的品格。当圣灵充满你，当圣灵来荣耀耶稣并给你看耶稣所做的事时，圣灵驱使你进入耶稣的名——他是谁和他所做的事。以下是你会看到的一件事：神恨恶邪恶。如果神不恨恶邪恶，他就不会差遣他的独生子。他没有理由差遣他的独生子到世上来。他恨恶邪恶。他恨恶疾病。他恨恶这里的苦难和死亡。他没有创造一个充满这些东西的世界。

然而神如何带来我们的救恩？他如何给我们生命？他如何给我们荣耀？通过可怕的事情发生在耶稣基督身上。神从死亡中带出生命。对不起，他从死亡中带出生命。他从苦难中带出荣耀。他从拒绝中带出救恩。所有这些可怕的事情。

看到邪恶使神悲伤。看到邪恶落在他独生子身上特别使神悲伤。然而当圣灵随着岁月的流逝越来越多地向你显示十字架的奇妙，神在十字架上所做之事的奇妙和智慧，当你看到因着耶稣的受苦神如何把更多的荣耀和喜乐带入世界——当苦难临到你时，你会开始说：我不知道你在做什么，但我感谢你。我知道你在工作。

看，如果你有这个，如果圣灵已经荣耀耶稣到你可以凡事常常感谢神的地步，那么你就成为一个口唱心和地赞美主的人。实际上，我喜欢那节经文。如果你刚读过它，它看起来有点浮夸，不是吗？口唱心和地赞美。然而，注意它不是说这是一个想着神的人，而是一个与神交流的人。我认为这节经文的意思是：口唱心和地赞美主意味着这是一个如此有神同在的感觉、如此在神实际同在中喜悦的人，如果可以的话，那个人会把它谱成歌。这是活在神的同在中带着这样的喜悦，如果你可以你会为此歌唱。如果你可能的话，你会把它谱成歌。

被圣灵充满意味着神是近的。被圣灵充满意味着你感受到神的亲近，你在神的亲近中喜悦，如果你可以你会为此歌唱，有时我们歌唱即使我们唱不好。对每个人来说可能听起来很糟糕，可能对神来说也是，但这没关系。

当然，被圣灵充满意味着，因此，既然我们在任何环境中都可以感谢神，既然我们时时刻刻在他的同在中喜悦，我们就成为用诗章、颂词、灵歌彼此对说的人。实际上我两年前就这节经文讲过一整篇道，我现在不能概括，但那节经文意味着不仅被圣灵充满的人喜爱音乐，需要通过音乐表达他们对神的喜乐，而且它也在谈论彼此歌唱，不只是向神歌唱。这意味着被圣灵充满的人彼此造就。被圣灵充满的人不断地互相谈论神在他们生命中所做的事，帮助我们自己以新的方式找到神，因为我们周围的朋友在向我们谈论这些事。被圣灵充满的人创造一种不可思议的基督徒团契。

所以这里是：谦卑的现实主义和涌动的喜乐并存。你的喜乐是这样的吗？你有这样的喜乐吗？它像星星一样。我认为当你生活的环境变得更黑暗时它会更亮。

如果这就是圣灵的充满，我怀疑这里没有人不属于两类之一。要么你会说，我对此一无所知，要么你会说，我知道的远不如我想要的多。

### 第三，我们如何能被圣灵充满？

让我只带你到圣经中一个大约十年前像锤子一样击中我的地方。我们可能不太想到耶稣被圣灵充满。是的，我们总是知道受洗的事，圣灵降下来膏他开始事工。但耶稣基督大部分时间都在哭泣。他总是忧患之人。他为拉撒路哭泣。他为耶路撒冷哭泣。他是忧患之人。但有一个令人惊奇的地方。它记载在路加福音第十章和马太福音第十一章，我们被告知耶稣在圣灵里欢腾，喜乐迸发。耶稣有了圣灵充满的经历。

路加福音第十章这样说：那时候，耶稣被圣灵感动就欢乐，说：父啊，天地的主，我感谢你！因为你将这些事向聪明通达人就藏起来，向婴孩就显出来。父啊，是的，因为你的美意本是如此。

再听一遍。耶稣被圣灵感动就欢乐，说：父啊，天地的主，我感谢你！因为你将这些事向聪明通达人就藏起来，向婴孩就显出来。父啊，是的，因为你的美意本是如此。

耶稣喜乐迸发。为什么？很有趣。他被圣灵充满，有圣灵的喜乐。这就是保罗在这里说的。它是怎么发生的？是这样发生的。

他注意到一些事情。首先，我们在这里学到，如果你找到神，不是因为你触及他或达到他或向他上升。不，任何人找到神的唯一方式是如果神向他启示自己，如果神向你揭开自己。但他向谁启示自己？他不向有学问的人启示自己。他不向自以为有智慧的人启示自己。他不向有成就的人、那些说"看我的成就，看我的道德，看我的才能"的人启示自己。他向小孩子启示自己。当然这是耶稣说的一个属灵短语——无助的人，软弱的人，知道自己一无所有的人，知道自己在灵里破产的人。

你知道耶稣在说什么吗？他说：我感谢你，父，天地的主，因为你是恩典的神。你不把世界分为好人和坏人。你把世界分为骄傲的人和无助的人。我感谢你，父，天地的主，因为你是恩典的神，你说本乎恩，不在乎行为。

耶稣看着福音。他看着恩典，圣灵就充满了他。现在看，耶稣是完美的。耶稣与神是对的。为什么耶稣需要圣灵的充满？我所知道的是，即使是耶稣也需要圣灵的充满来度过他的生活，面对他所面对的事情。他真的把全世界的重担放在他身上，但他能承受，因为他有圣灵的充满。他怎么得到的？他看着恩典。他看着福音。

好，看这个。让我们现在就做。诗篇51篇，大卫绝望地对神说：不要从我收回你的圣灵。主啊，不要从我收回你的圣灵。不要收回圣灵。为什么？为什么他害怕？因为他犯了罪。看，圣灵，神的灵是圣洁的。神的灵不能与罪同住。大卫知道这一点。大卫知道他将要被抛弃。他应该被神的灵抛弃，连同所有的喜乐，所有的能力。那会毁了大卫作为王。他只是说：不要从我收回你的圣灵。我应该被圣灵离弃，但不要从我收回圣灵。

猜猜怎样？神没有从他收回圣灵。圣灵与他同在，即使他是罪人，即使他应该被抛弃。所以这个有罪的大卫说：不要从我收回你的圣灵，神没有。

几个世纪后，最终的大卫，更大的大卫，大卫的后裔，无罪的耶稣基督，真正的王，说：我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？你知道他在说什么吗？他在说：不要从我收回你的圣灵。不要收回你的面。不要从我收回你的同在。不要取走它。但神取走了。为什么？

你知道，有罪的大卫应该失去圣灵。无罪的、最终的、更大的大卫不应该失去圣灵，但有罪的大卫保留了圣灵的充满，而无罪的大卫耶稣基督失去了圣灵的充满。为什么？因为耶稣基督站在我们的位置上，他被抛弃了。他得到了大卫应得的、你我应得的抛弃。为什么？所以他失去圣灵的充满，好让你我即使是罪人也能拥有。

看着那个。看着那个并说：我感谢你，父，天地的主，你本乎恩典拯救了我。你无聊吗？你心里现在有死气吗？是因为你忘记了恩典。它对你的心不真实。你有爱人的困难吗？你觉得真的，你看不起人吗？你对人生气吗？是因为你忘记了恩典。它没有融化和谦卑你的心。你焦虑吗？你害怕神会让你失望吗？是因为你忘记了恩典。你忘记了神不会抛弃你的事实。看他在十字架上为你所做的。

看恩典，恩典，恩典，直到有喜乐的迸发——圣灵的喜乐。你想被圣灵充满吗？首先，你必须被基督充满。你必须成为小孩子。你必须单单依靠他得救。你必须停止说：主啊，请因为我所做的或我是谁而接纳我。你必须说：主啊，请单单因恩典，因耶稣所做的而接纳我。

所以为了被圣灵充满，首先你必须被基督充满。但然后，你必须花时间。你必须在早晨、晚上、可能在一天中间花时间。你必须留出时间让你看圣经的真理。关于神的一般真理和福音的特殊真理。学习它，认识它，默想它，求圣灵在你里面点燃它。

听着，这不像是：哦，你有你的教义和所有的真理，但我对神秘经历感兴趣。不，圣灵，圣灵的经历是真理在你生命中燃烧。是神学在你生命中燃烧。那需要学习，那需要祷告，那需要恩典的途径，那需要祷告和敬拜、学习、小组祷告、个人祷告和集体祷告的属灵操练。你不能只是每月来教会几次希望得到一些灵感，就期望圣灵的充满。

系统地、主题地、有纪律地看耶稣基督所做的，直到你能说：我感谢你，父，天地的主，你是恩典的神，你对我施恩。

让我们祷告。我们的父，我们非常感激你是恩典的神，你不把世界分为好人和坏人，而是分为骄傲的人和无助的人。那些不认为他们需要恩典的人和那些知道他们需要恩典的人。我们感谢你愿意进入我们的生活，但我们也知道我们没有经历这种谦卑的现实主义和涌动的喜乐，这种高度超自然充能的认知。我们没有让自己可用，我们求你的圣灵充满我们。充满我们。让我们继续被你的圣灵充满，以便我们也能成为一群彼此歌唱、彼此说话、在爱中彼此建立的会众。父啊，帮助我们通过你圣灵的启发应用所有这些事情。我们奉耶稣的名求。阿门。
