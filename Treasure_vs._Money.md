## English Transcript / 英文原文

the teachings based, we're going  through the Sermon on the Mount, and we come to what Jesus has to say about money and  possessions, and he has plenty to say, more than we can cover, but let's read it. Matthew 6, do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy,  where thieves break in and steal, but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where  moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal, for where your  treasure is, there your heart will be also. The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light, but if your eyes are bad,  your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness?

No one can serve two masters. He will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise  the other. You cannot serve both God and money. Therefore, I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink, or about  your body, what you will wear, is not life more important than food, and is not the body  more important than clothes. Look at the birds of the air, they do not sell or reap, or store away in barns, and  yet your heavenly Father feeds them, and are you?

Are you not much more valuable than they? Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life? And why do you worry about clothes? See how the lilies of the field grow? They don't labor or spin yet.

I tell you that not even Solomon and all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God closed the grass of the field, which is here today, and the mar was thrown  into the fire, will he not much more clothes you? Oh, you little faith. So do not worry saying, what should we eat, or what should we drink, or what should we  wear, for the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need  them. But seek first is kingdom, and is righteousness, and all these things will be given to you  as well.

Therefore, do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own, as God's word. Now the Sermon on the Mount talks about how, if we actually take the gospel, the essential  message of Jesus Christ, we actually take the gospel, and we live it out. What will it look like, and that's what the Sermon on the Mount is about. And now we get to the area of money and possessions, money and possessions.

And Jesus tells us three things that we can draw out here. He tells us how money controls us, you know, how it has a power over us, how it exercises  power. So first of all, how money exercises power over us, and then secondly, why money exercises  power over us, and then thirdly, how we can break the power, okay? How it exercises power, why it exercises power, and then how we break it. Now first of all, how money exercises the power over us, and one of the curious things  for interpreters, or anybody who's reading and trying to understand the passage, is this  illustration, this little saying about the eye.

It says the eye is the lamp of the body, and if your eyes are good, your whole body will  be full of light. If your eyes are bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. Now what that means is very simple. We're in this room and there's light in this room. And if your eye works, it means if it takes the light in, you will by the light be able  to move your body through the room.

You know, you'll see where the eye is, and you'll move that way, and you know, you won't  stumble, and you won't fall. And all this saying is basically pointing out is if your eye isn't working, even though  there's a lot of light all around the rest of your body, your whole body is in a sense  is in the darkness. If your eye's not working, there's a sense in which there's no other part of your body  that can see, or take the light in, and say, so if your eye's not working, your whole  body is in darkness. Whether or not the whole room is flooded with light, see. So you say, and you know, when you're reading this, you say, what's that got to do with  anything?

In fact, if you look, you say, okay, verses 19 to 21 is all about money. And then verses 24, and following is about money. What's the saying doing in here? It's a little easier to understand his point. If you go to Luke 11 and 12, and Luke 11 and 12, Jesus uses the same discussion as illustration,  the eye is the lamp of the body, if your eye is dark, your whole body is dark.

And he also talks about money, and again, it's connected, and when you get into Luke 12,  you see after he talks about the eye and the lamp, he says, so watch out for greed. That's in Luke 12. He says, watch out for greed, watch out for all kinds of greed. Now, what is he saying? Very interesting.

He's saying that greed and materialism, materialism is an inordinate desire or dependence on money  and material things, an inordinate desire or dependence on money and material things. The materialism has the peculiar effect of blinding you spiritually, of distorting the  way you see things. It has a power over the way you see everything. Now, what do I mean about it? All right.

Let me give you some examples. First of all, for example, materialism has the power to blind you to materialism. So what Jesus is saying is very interesting. Let me cast it in this light. Kathy, some years ago, my wife Kathy noticed that I was doing a series of monthly morning  breakfast.

I was speaking in a men's breakfast once a month on the seven deadly sins, and you know  the seven deadly sins have lust and they have pride and they have envy and they have anger  and so forth. And of course, one of the seven deadly sins is greed. And Kathy says, now, are they advertising these things? I mean, are they saying, here's the subject and then people are bringing their friends  and I said, yeah, right. They're advertising.

He says, so they'll know when greedy. The month that you're speaking on greed. I said, right. Watch the attendance is going to drop. It's just going to go down.

They're not going to come out to hear about greed. And she was right. She was right. It was the worst attendant of all of them. And I thought about that.

Why? Why? I'll tell you why. It's not that they were hostile. It's not that people said, oh, that's a terrible idea.

I don't want to talk about greed. I want to hear about greed. Oh no. Everybody was just so absolutely sure. It's not true of them.

In other words, see, this is different than the other sins. This is why Jesus says this is an eye sin. This puts this darkens your eye spiritually. You don't have to say to somebody. Jesus did not say to anybody, watch out.

You might be committing adultery. I mean, if you're committing adultery,  you know you're committing adultery. You don't say, oh, you're not my wife. I mean, it doesn't happen. But Jesus has to say, watch out.

You might be greedy. You see, because greed hides itself,  it blinds you in a way that adultery doesn't really. I mean, you know if you're committing adultery. Over the years, as a pastor, I've had people come in  to talk to me about sins. It's a confess sins that come in and say,  I want to talk to you about a real problem  having something wrong.

I haven't confessed as other people,  but you're a pastor priest, rabbi type,  and I'll tell you about it. And they do, they come and they'll talk about anger,  and they'll talk about bitterness, and they'll talk about lust,  and they'll talk about pride, and they'll talk about everything. But I don't think I remember anybody coming to me  ever to confess the sin of greed. I don't think anybody came in to say, pastor, I'm materialistic. Never done it, because it has a,  now I know what this means is, Jesus is saying,  you don't ask.

You don't consider the possibility that you're greedy. You just don't think you are. You just say, me, greedy? You think of rich, rich people. You think of people that spend tons of,  the trouble is you've all got friends.

In fact, most of you even have a relative  who's much more kind of extravagant with money than you are. And that's all it takes. All you've got to do is know somebody who's really greedy  and you don't even think that you're greedy. You don't even, you wouldn't even consider the possibility  that you're materialistic. You don't even, that's the reason why it didn't come.

Not, they were bored. They're bored. They figured, this isn't, this doesn't apply to me. And you see this, I, if you're there tonight  and you say, well, this is not a problem of mine. That's a very bad sign.

This is one of the sins that has the sign,  a symptom is that I'm sure it's just not true of me. And therefore, Jesus is saying, watch out. Is this sin of the eye? It darkens your eye. For example, let me give you some examples  of how I can darken your eye.

For example, sometimes you choose a job. Materialism has the power to get you to choose a job. Not one that you love, not one that you're good at,  not one that helps people,  but one that just makes you money. You do it because it'll get you to a certain status in life. And you choose the job on the basis of that.

You know, for five to 10 years,  the adrenaline can keep you going. And then after a while, you just find yourself empty inside. Why did you choose the job? Your eye was dark. I'm not saying everybody does this, but so many people do.

Or let me give you another example. In the conduct of your job, not only can materialism  blind you as you choose your job,  in the conduct of your job. For example, many, many, many, many companies,  many, many companies are making money,  but we all know this. They're hurting neighborhoods. They're hurting towns.

They're hurting people. We know this. Now, there's all sorts of people in the company. And what are they doing? Are they saying, ha ha, in order to make money,  I am ruining the environment of that little town?

Ha ha, no, you're not doing that. What are you doing? You're not asking. You don't want to go there. You don't ask questions.

You don't want to know. You don't want to think out. You don't want to ask hard questions about  is are the deals that my company is making? Are the things that my company is doing? Is this really helping people?

Is it hurting people? Is it helping the town or is it hurting the town? Is it helping the neighborhood? Is it hurting people? You don't want to know.

You don't want to go. That's the blindness. That's what Jesus is talking about. Greed doesn't go ha ha. I am, you know, gouging the poor.

No, but are you asking whether your company is? You need to ask that. If you're not even asking that,  that means the blind eye, the dark eye. Do you see that? Or do it one more.

Materialism keeps you from asking hard questions  about your lifestyle. Now you see, one of the problems with being professionals. If you are, you know, so many of you are professionals. Now, if you, you know, if you go to the bowling alley,  with the other kind of working class people,  by and large everybody there's making the same amount of money. By and large.

However, if you're a professional, one of the problems is  the kinds of people you come into contact with  many, many, many times, sometimes your friends  are making 10 times the money you are. Or people you go to parties with,  or circles that you get into. And there's always somebody. Once you've got that little ticket  into the professional world,  you're constantly rubbing the people you work with. You might have a pretty good job,  but here's a person who's three levels above  and that person's making 10 times,  50 times what you're making.

And therefore you're sure,  at this the reason why, don't forget,  the person who is making, that you think that's person's rich,  that person's making seven figures. They're hanging out with people  who make 10 times more than they do every year. And therefore nobody ever feels rich. You know, there's probably one or two people  that know they're rich, but everybody else makes them feel okay. They probably say I'm rich, you know?

But hardly anybody else does. And you don't ask these questions,  do I really need to spend this much money on this? Do I need to be putting this much money into my apartment? Do I need to be spending this much money for my apartment? Do I, you know, do I need to be spending this much money  on clothes?

And you say, because you, because you compare,  immediately you think of other people who do much more  and therefore you don't ask the question,  you don't go there, you don't ask. You don't say, wait a minute,  isn't there ways in which I could be giving more of my money  to the church, to the poor, to my friends, to the neighbors? Isn't there ways in which I could be much more radical  generous if I made this and that and that change? You don't want to ask, you don't want to think. In 1635, I got named Robert Cain, 1635 now.

I was a member of the first congregational church of Boston. And I think back then there probably only was  one congregational church in Boston, I don't know. I would think. And he was doing pretty well as a businessman,  but in 1635 his elders disciplined him  for the sin of greed. They, I don't think they excommunicated,  I think they suspended him from the Lord's sufferer,  they admonished him.

So his elders disciplined him for the sin of greed. Now, how do they do that? Is because he was selling his product at a 6% profit. And the church had decided three or four years before that  that they were only, Christians were only allowed  to sell their wares at a 4% profit. So when they found out he was doing 6%  they disciplined him for the sin of greed.

Now some of you are out there saying,  where is this illustration going? I'll tell you where it's going. They realized, now this is not as stupid as it sounds. My wife certainly thought it's not as stupid  when I first read it to her,  but I'll tell you why it's not. And I convinced her it wasn't.

You know, she said, where is it saying the Bible 4%? What are you talking about? Well, here, now listen, they knew something  and that is that when you're committing adultery  you know you're committing adultery  but when you're being greedy you never know. And so they sat down as Christians  and they said now look, according to the Bible  Jesus talks about money all the time. He's constantly saying watch out for greed.

He's always saying give your money away. He's always saying don't spend all your money on yourself. I mean, especially in the book of Luke  but all the way through the Gospels, it is frightening. I mean, I can't preach on money  as often as Jesus preached on money. I wouldn't have a church.

I mean, you know, everybody gets so quiet. I mean, nobody walks out singing, you know  and yet Jesus talked about money all the time. So this Congressional Church got together  and said we got a problem here. Some business practices must be greedy. Some lifestyles have to be greedy  but how are we gonna know?

There have to be some. We can't just say well, you know, there have to be some  and so they said all right, as a Christian community  let's sit down and let's just say at our time in our place  in this spot, we can't talk about everything else  but let us decide what is a greedy lifestyle,  what are greedy business practices  and so they got together and by consensus  they decided on summit and they said now  let us hold each other accountable. So it was mutual, it was consensual, you know,  very modern, consensual, everything is okay,  but it's consensual and they got together  and they made this decision and of course he knew about it  but he tried to move past it  and therefore he was right, they were right. Now, I am not saying by any means that today  in our economy you could possibly come up  when you consider how different every field is  you could never come up with a nice simple,  I mean that was a whole different world in so many ways. You couldn't come up with a nice simple rule of thumb  even if you all got together and said look,  we're just gonna do this for ourselves,  you couldn't do that.

But here's the point, who are you accountable to? What Christians have gotten together with you  and mutually you say let's talk about  how we're spending our money on each other on ourselves. How much we're giving away, how much we're keeping  what we're doing. Who has, who have you authorized? What Christians have you authorized to do that  and then you're of course authorized to do it with him.

You have to talk about with somebody,  you've gotta have some standards and you can't trust yourself. That's the principle, you cannot trust yourself  to decide this. And I know what your answer, I know what you're thinking  and I know what I'm thinking and that is,  I don't even think about that, I don't wanna, I don't want,  I don't even wanna think myself about it. When I make, when I spend on money,  I don't even wanna sit down myself and think,  gee, did I really have to do that? I mean not only don't wanna talk to other people  but I don't even talk to myself about it,  I just wanna do it.

And that's Jesus' whole point about greed. Money has the power to keep you from asking questions  about how you spend your money and how you make your money. Money has the power to keep you from asking questions  about how you spend it, how you make it,  the hard questions. Now, why? Why does money have that power?

If that's how it has, I mean that's the power of greed. The power of greed is to not ask. The power of greed is to not think. The power of greed is to say what's not true of me. We live in the most wealthiest society  in a history of the world,  especially the last five to 10 years.

There's never been, right now at least 70% of the wealth  in the whole world is essentially in the hands  of about 5% of the people, which is pretty much America. And we are professionals and if you're a professional in this room,  that means you're in the top 20% of that 5%. There's never been a group of people as wealthy as we are. And here, do we dare? Is there anybody in this room that dares to say,  I really am doing just fine when it comes to material things.

I couldn't give any more way. I couldn't live any more simply. I couldn't be any more generous with my money. I'm pretty generous. The rest of the world knows better.

The rest of the world looks at us and says to Americans,  there's so many things you could be doing in this world. If you just didn't think you had to have that gadget,  there are so many things, the rest of the world sees it. It's astounding that we live in the place we live,  in the time we live and we won't even think about  the possibility that we're greedy. That shows the power of greed. It shows the power of money.

Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer? Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp  the heart of the Christian faith? For many of us, the summer months can provide more time  to deepen our faith and our understanding  of what it means to follow Christ. A great resource to start using this summer  is the new city catacism devotional. God's truth for our hearts and minds.

This devotional brings the historic catacisms  of the Christian Church to life, offering a question  to consider for each week of the year. In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case  for catacases, the rich and communal practice  of learning and memorizing questions and answers  that frame the foundational beliefs of the Christian faith. Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer,  and a brief meditation that will challenge and inspire you. The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors  such as John Piper, Tim Keller, and Kevin D. Young,  as well as historical figures such as Augustine,  John Calvin, and Martin Luther.

This month, in addition to the new city catacism devotional,  we are including a great companion resource,  the new city catacism for kids,  as our thank you for your gift  to help gospel and life share the hope of Christ's love  with people all over the world. So request your copies today at gospelonlife.com slash give. That's gospelonlife.com slash give. Now, here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. Now, that's how.

Why? I'll be real brief about this. Why is it? That money has this power. Well, the answer is in the little verse,  very famous verse, which Jesus says,  where your treasure is, there is your heart also.

What he means by that is this. Money serves the way in which you actually,  the place where your heart really rests,  is revealed by money. So what it means is, money is a way  of getting significance for many of us. For so many people,  I'm not saying it's everybody in this room on this one,  because this changes. But Jesus says, for example,  one of the reasons why we need so much money,  one of the reasons why we spend it on ourselves,  one of the reasons we don't give it away like we should,  is because of money is our significance.

It shows us, for example,  the fact that we're able to live in a certain place,  the fact that we're able to eat certain places,  the fact that we're in certain social circles,  the fact that we can dress in a certain way,  makes us feel we're important. And you know, it's true. We have a tendency to do this. The higher up economically we get,  we don't just look at other people  who are below us economically and say,  oh, you're below me economically,  we say, you're below me. You don't see that happening to yourself?

I mean, you don't have to be very well off. Middle class people in general feel superior to the poor. We do. Oh, we give money and we're sorry for the poor,  we make pity the poor,  but we feel superior to them. And there's no good reason to.

You know, we started the same place that they did  with the same parents they had,  with the same situation they had. Do you really think it'd be that much better? I don't know. But we automatically feel,  when we feel like we're better economically than somebody else,  we feel like we're better. When we're higher caliber or socio-economically,  we feel like we're higher caliber.

It's so automatic, it's so fast. And because money is something that many of us take  and we say that's my significance. That's what makes me feel important. But on the other hand, for other people,  other people are different. And other people take money and make money their security.

See, some people use money for approval,  other people use money for control. Some people use money in order to say I feel important. But many other people say I need money, so I'm safe. Don't forget what I'm saying here. I'm asking this question.

If you're not giving your money away in eye-popping proportions,  if you find it very difficult,  if you're not so radically generous of the world's amazed  at the Christians and most of us are not. Why? One answer is, why has it had that power? One answer is, it's money is your significance,  the other possibilities, money is your security. In other words, you feel like if I got money,  then I have control in an uncontrollable world.

I have control over my life, I have control. You know, I've got, if things come along, I'm safe. And Jesus Christ says,  running after these things cannot add a minute, an hour. They can't add a minute to your life. It's God who's in control of these things.

Money is not going to turn you into God. God, money is not going to be able to get  one little bit of control. One of my professors, Addison Leach, who was the second husband,  he died of Elizabeth Elliot. Elizabeth Elliot, who came here last week. Some of you saw, met her, went to her conference.

And she had two husbands die on her  before she is now married to third time. Her second husband was a professor of mine  and I heard him once tell the story. And he said, he was thinking about this idea  that money can be your security. He had a couple of young women in his,  a couple of young women that where he was a teacher at college  became Christians in college,  and they came back to their parents. And they said, we've become Christians  and we want to be missionaries.

And the parents said, oh no, missionaries. And they said, look, each of them said, now dear,  you've had a religious experience. How wonderful. But you need some security. Before you go off to take your, have your missionary experience,  which is fine, if you want to go, that's fine.

But first we want you to have a master's degree. We want you to have taken a job or two,  so you've got some records,  so you've gotten your career off the ground. And we want you to have some money in the bank  for some security. And they came back to my professor, Dr. Leach,  and they said, what do we say about that?

And Dr. Leach said, oh, here's what I would say  to my dear parents. Tell them, we're on a little ball of rock  spinning through space. It's called Earth. And who knows if we're going to run into something,  but even if we don't someday,  under each one of us is going to open a trap door.

And everybody's going to fall off. I mean, at the end of your life, a trap door opens up  underneath you, and you fall off a little ball of rock,  and underneath will be the everlasting arms  or nothing at all. And you think a master's degree  is going to give you some security. Let's see. And that's what Jesus is saying right here.

He says, the power of money is,  it seems like it can give you significance,  but actually when you make money,  you're significant, you become an arrogant person  that nobody likes. And you think money can give you some security,  but the fact is that money can't possibly stop all the things. It can't stop death, it can't stop tragedy,  it can't stop broken relationships,  it can't stop anything. So how do we break the power of money in our lives? Well, the answer is this.

How do we get to the place where we're really radically generous? How do we get to the place where we're not worrying about money? How do we get to the place where we're not,  we don't feel, you know,  there's a lot of ways in which money controls us. Let's take a look. Verse 19.

Do not stir up for yourselves treasures on earth,  where moth and rust destroy,  where these break in and steal,  but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven,  where moth and rust do not destroy,  and where these do not break in and steal. Now, literally, he says,  don't treasure earthly treasures,  but treasure heavenly treasure. That's what he says. And that's important to know,  everybody at the center of their soul  has something they treasure. What does it mean to treasure something?

It means to look at something,  fill your heart with a beauty and the value of it,  and to treasure something is to say,  if I have this, everything's worth it. If I have this, it's all worth it. And if I have this,  I'm worth it. In other words,  everybody's got something. It might be money, it might be career,  it might be status, it might be romance,  it might be a family,  you're looking at it and it's your treasure.

And you say, if I could have this, it'll all be worth it. Everybody in this room's got something,  something on earth they're doing that about. Everybody, if I had this, it would all be worth it. And then I'd be worth it. My favorite fantasy book, Lord of the Rings,  which I've been rereading recently,  it's all about the special ring,  and it's beautiful,  and whoever owns it,  calls it the precious.

Any of you ever read Lord of the Rings? Everybody who gets this ring,  in a sense comes under its power,  because you look at it,  and everybody who gets it calls it my precious, the precious. And that's what Jesus is saying,  is at the center of everybody's soul,  there's the precious,  something that you've looked at,  and you said,  this is precious to me. This is the thing that if I have,  it's all worth it. This is the thing that if I have it,  then I'm worth it.

You've got something. But whatever that is,  you are enslaved to it. Anything that your soul treasures,  once your soul treasures something,  you will pay any price for it. You will do anything to get it,  because it's the only thing that's worth it. See?

Now, the Bible says,  every treasure but Jesus  will insist that you die to purchase it. But Jesus himself is the one treasure  who died to purchase you. Anything else you make your supreme value,  will say, die for me. But if you make Jesus Christ your supreme value,  he's the one who said,  I've died for you. How do you make Jesus Christ your treasure?

Only if you make him your treasure. Only if he is your heavenly treasure. Only if you treasure him. Well, you actually be in a sense free from money. Now, I'll explain what that means in a second.

But first, how can you treasure Jesus? Think about what he did with his treasure. He had the ultimate treasure. He was the Lord. He had the ultimate status.

And he also had the ultimate security. He was the Son. That was the Father. But when he came to earth,  what happened to him on the cross? He was utterly stripped.

When he was stripped naked  of all of his belongings and all of his possessions,  that was just an echo of the fact that he was spiritually stripped. He lost all of his treasure. Why? He died for something. Now, you only die for that, which is your precious.

And what this means is,  Jesus Christ must have looked at us. And must have said,  if I have them,  even going to hell,  will be worth it. And Isaiah chapter 53 tells us by prophecy  that when he saw the results of his suffering,  he was satisfied. Now, you know,  in 1 Peter 2.9,  it says,  you are a chosen race. He's talking to the Christians.

You are a holy nation. You are a royal priesthood. You are God's purchased possession. That means you are his treasure. Unless you know that he was willing to lose all his treasure  so that you could be his treasure.

Unless you realize that he looked at you  and he felt towards you like that. That he felt  if I have them,  anything's worth. Nothing would be worth losing them. Anything would be worth saving them. You know that he treasures you.

You know he cares about you like that. That and that alone will free you. Absolutely free you from money. It'll free you from everything. It won't just free you from money.

And here's what I mean by free you from money. Some of you,  here's a test. Here's one of the ways you know  that you have spiritual wealth. How do you react to rich people? I'll tell you how most of us do it.

Many of you resent rich people. You feel disdainful of them. You say look at their money. Look at their homes. Look at all this stuff.

And you feel superior to them. And that shows that money still has power over you. If you dislike rich people,  if you feel superior to rich people,  that shows money still got power over you. It shows a lack of spiritual wealth in you. It shows actually a lack of humility.

And the gospel is your center. So you haven't really received it. However, if you envy rich people,  if you can't believe that this person  has let me come into this room  and into this apartment. Look how neat this is. Isn't this incredible?

See, that also shows that money's got power over you. The gospel is you're more sinful than you ever dared believe. You're more loved than you ever dared hope. The more sinful keeps you from feeling superior to rich people. The more loved keeps you from feeling inferior to rich people.

And therefore, the gospel puts you in a place where you really don't care about money anymore. And the best way to see that money had no longer has any power over you  is that you can love rich people. Secondly, the way you can tell that money has no more power over you  is that you also respect for people. That you looked at them and you respect them  and you expect to learn from them  and you don't look down your nose at them. And boy, that's mighty, mighty, mighty hard.

But by and large, there's a tendency, you know,  money still has power over us because we very often we get around poor people. We just really look down our nose at them. You know, you rub, this is New York, fortunately. And in New York, you actually actually do ride subways with poor people. And you see poor people.

I mean, you know, the rest of the country, we just keep, we just get them away. We just get them away. We zone them away. In New York, you can't zone people away. Thank you.

That's great, New York. In some ways, New York is more like the new Jerusalem. A lot of people are going to hate the New Jerusalem because they hate New York. There's not going to be any zoning there. And one of the good things is you are around poor people.

How do you respond to them? One of the ways you can see that money has lost its power over you  because of the gospel of Jesus, because you know that he lost all of his treasure  to make you his treasure. That humbles you, that melts you, that lifts you up. And one of the ways you'll know is that you no longer,  you have no trouble loving rich people. Secondly, you have no trouble loving poor people.

But the third, the third sign that money no longer has power over your life is this. You get really generous. You know what's interesting? Verse 22, the eyes, the lamp of the body, if your eyes are good,  if your eyes are good, that word actually is a double meaning in Greek. The word good also means generous.

And a Christian who's really been freed from money by finding Jesus is their treasure  gets a generous eye. You're always looking and always looking for opportunities. You're looking at your friends, your neighbors, your looking at your church,  you're looking at the poor, you're looking at your city. And you're always looking for ways to give away. You want to say, well, how much?

This is the last thing I'll say. Well, you have to look at what Jesus did. When Jesus treasured you, he treasured you sacrificially. Now, if you want to respond to Jesus, that means that I have got to not just simply  live out the cross of Jesus Christ in my relationships,  I've also got to live out the cross of Jesus Christ economically. Now follow me here.

You know, most every Christian says, oh, I'm a Christian. And therefore, I need to, Jesus died for me and he lived a sacrificial life for me. And therefore, I have to love others as Christ loved me. Fine. That means you have got to give enough money away this year that it sacrifices your lifestyle.

If you give money, but it doesn't really cut into the way in which you live,  it doesn't sacrifice. There's no cross in your economic life. If you don't give enough away enough money so that it really makes a difference  in how you live your life, in your lifestyle, then there's no cross. And you're not really responding to Jesus as he's responded to you. Now, for most of us, I'll tell you this, not yet, for most people, I shouldn't say of us.

For most people, most places in most times in the world, the tithe is the goal. Why? Because most places, most times, most people, the Bible says, give away 10%,  that's a good, nice figure to think about in terms of your giving. That's a good way to tell whether or not the gospel is working in your heart. Because if the gospel is working in your heart and you see what Jesus Christ has done for you,  it doesn't seem like much.

I mean, after all, what if Jesus had tithes as blood, you still be lost. I mean, Jesus went way past the tithe. So the point is 10% doesn't seem like very much. However, for most people, it does mean a sacrifice. There'll be a cross in the 10% for most of us.

For most of us, 10% is really going to be hard. It's going to hurt. But increasingly in America, there are people for whom 10% does not make a dent. And you see, the 10% is not the point. The Bible tells you how much I be giving away.

The 10% is just a rule of thumb. It's just a helping, a good way to get started. The cross is the standard. The 10% is just sort of an example for most of us. But the cross is the standard.

Is there a cross in your life? In your economic life. If Jesus is your treasure, you'll love the rich. If Jesus is your treasure, you'll love the poor. If Jesus is the treasure, you'll be giving your money away joyfully, deliberately, happily.

That's the reason why the early church was so successful. We have an old letter from Diagnetus, who talked about the early Christians. Why they were so popular and why they stunned people. He says, we share our table with all, but we do not share our bed with all. He said, in other words, the pagans are promiscuous with their body, but very stingy with their money.

And Christians are very stingy with their body and incredibly promiscuous with their money. Which kind of person benefited their neighborhood? In other words, would you want to live in a neighborhood? I said this last week, I think. Would you want to live in a neighborhood with a group of people who are stingy with their money?

And very promiscuous with their body? What impact would that have on the neighborhood? If you're a child, where do you want to live? Do you want to live in a neighborhood of people like that? Or do you want to live in a neighborhood of people?

Who practice sexual integrity and financial promiscuity? A city filled with that kind of person is going to be a healthy city. A neighborhood filled with that kind of person is going to be a healthy neighborhood. There are tremendous public ramifications of the Sermon on the Mount. Let's live it.

Let's pray. Our Father, I thank You for giving us this time to consider  what it means to treasure up treasures in heaven. We thank You for what Your Son did for us. We thank You for all of that. And we pray that You would help it become such a reality in our lives that money no longer has power over us.

The intimidation we feel around people who have more money,  or the inferiority we feel, or even the anger we feel,  or the superiority we feel. Oh, Lord, change that so that we are very different kinds of people. We are unique people. You've done it in the past. The early church really understood this.

Let it be true of us, too. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

the teachings based, we're going  through the Sermon on the Mount, and we come to what Jesus has to say about money and  possessions, and he has plenty to say, more than we can cover, but let's read it. Matthew 6, do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy,  where thieves break in and steal, but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where  moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal, for where your  treasure is, there your heart will be also. The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light, but if your eyes are bad,  your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness?

No one can serve two masters. He will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise  the other. You cannot serve both God and money. Therefore, I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink, or about  your body, what you will wear, is not life more important than food, and is not the body  more important than clothes. Look at the birds of the air, they do not sell or reap, or store away in barns, and  yet your heavenly Father feeds them, and are you?

Are you not much more valuable than they? Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life? And why do you worry about clothes? See how the lilies of the field grow? They don't labor or spin yet.

I tell you that not even Solomon and all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God closed the grass of the field, which is here today, and the mar was thrown  into the fire, will he not much more clothes you? Oh, you little faith. So do not worry saying, what should we eat, or what should we drink, or what should we  wear, for the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need  them. But seek first is kingdom, and is righteousness, and all these things will be given to you  as well.

Therefore, do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own, as God's word. Now the Sermon on the Mount talks about how, if we actually take the gospel, the essential  message of Jesus Christ, we actually take the gospel, and we live it out. What will it look like, and that's what the Sermon on the Mount is about. And now we get to the area of money and possessions, money and possessions.

And Jesus tells us three things that we can draw out here. He tells us how money controls us, you know, how it has a power over us, how it exercises  power. So first of all, how money exercises power over us, and then secondly, why money exercises  power over us, and then thirdly, how we can break the power, okay? How it exercises power, why it exercises power, and then how we break it. Now first of all, how money exercises the power over us, and one of the curious things  for interpreters, or anybody who's reading and trying to understand the passage, is this  illustration, this little saying about the eye.

It says the eye is the lamp of the body, and if your eyes are good, your whole body will  be full of light. If your eyes are bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. Now what that means is very simple. We're in this room and there's light in this room. And if your eye works, it means if it takes the light in, you will by the light be able  to move your body through the room.

You know, you'll see where the eye is, and you'll move that way, and you know, you won't  stumble, and you won't fall. And all this saying is basically pointing out is if your eye isn't working, even though  there's a lot of light all around the rest of your body, your whole body is in a sense  is in the darkness. If your eye's not working, there's a sense in which there's no other part of your body  that can see, or take the light in, and say, so if your eye's not working, your whole  body is in darkness. Whether or not the whole room is flooded with light, see. So you say, and you know, when you're reading this, you say, what's that got to do with  anything?

In fact, if you look, you say, okay, verses 19 to 21 is all about money. And then verses 24, and following is about money. What's the saying doing in here? It's a little easier to understand his point. If you go to Luke 11 and 12, and Luke 11 and 12, Jesus uses the same discussion as illustration,  the eye is the lamp of the body, if your eye is dark, your whole body is dark.

And he also talks about money, and again, it's connected, and when you get into Luke 12,  you see after he talks about the eye and the lamp, he says, so watch out for greed. That's in Luke 12. He says, watch out for greed, watch out for all kinds of greed. Now, what is he saying? Very interesting.

He's saying that greed and materialism, materialism is an inordinate desire or dependence on money  and material things, an inordinate desire or dependence on money and material things. The materialism has the peculiar effect of blinding you spiritually, of distorting the  way you see things. It has a power over the way you see everything. Now, what do I mean about it? All right.

Let me give you some examples. First of all, for example, materialism has the power to blind you to materialism. So what Jesus is saying is very interesting. Let me cast it in this light. Kathy, some years ago, my wife Kathy noticed that I was doing a series of monthly morning  breakfast.

I was speaking in a men's breakfast once a month on the seven deadly sins, and you know  the seven deadly sins have lust and they have pride and they have envy and they have anger  and so forth. And of course, one of the seven deadly sins is greed. And Kathy says, now, are they advertising these things? I mean, are they saying, here's the subject and then people are bringing their friends  and I said, yeah, right. They're advertising.

He says, so they'll know when greedy. The month that you're speaking on greed. I said, right. Watch the attendance is going to drop. It's just going to go down.

They're not going to come out to hear about greed. And she was right. She was right. It was the worst attendant of all of them. And I thought about that.

Why? Why? I'll tell you why. It's not that they were hostile. It's not that people said, oh, that's a terrible idea.

I don't want to talk about greed. I want to hear about greed. Oh no. Everybody was just so absolutely sure. It's not true of them.

In other words, see, this is different than the other sins. This is why Jesus says this is an eye sin. This puts this darkens your eye spiritually. You don't have to say to somebody. Jesus did not say to anybody, watch out.

You might be committing adultery. I mean, if you're committing adultery,  you know you're committing adultery. You don't say, oh, you're not my wife. I mean, it doesn't happen. But Jesus has to say, watch out.

You might be greedy. You see, because greed hides itself,  it blinds you in a way that adultery doesn't really. I mean, you know if you're committing adultery. Over the years, as a pastor, I've had people come in  to talk to me about sins. It's a confess sins that come in and say,  I want to talk to you about a real problem  having something wrong.

I haven't confessed as other people,  but you're a pastor priest, rabbi type,  and I'll tell you about it. And they do, they come and they'll talk about anger,  and they'll talk about bitterness, and they'll talk about lust,  and they'll talk about pride, and they'll talk about everything. But I don't think I remember anybody coming to me  ever to confess the sin of greed. I don't think anybody came in to say, pastor, I'm materialistic. Never done it, because it has a,  now I know what this means is, Jesus is saying,  you don't ask.

You don't consider the possibility that you're greedy. You just don't think you are. You just say, me, greedy? You think of rich, rich people. You think of people that spend tons of,  the trouble is you've all got friends.

In fact, most of you even have a relative  who's much more kind of extravagant with money than you are. And that's all it takes. All you've got to do is know somebody who's really greedy  and you don't even think that you're greedy. You don't even, you wouldn't even consider the possibility  that you're materialistic. You don't even, that's the reason why it didn't come.

Not, they were bored. They're bored. They figured, this isn't, this doesn't apply to me. And you see this, I, if you're there tonight  and you say, well, this is not a problem of mine. That's a very bad sign.

This is one of the sins that has the sign,  a symptom is that I'm sure it's just not true of me. And therefore, Jesus is saying, watch out. Is this sin of the eye? It darkens your eye. For example, let me give you some examples  of how I can darken your eye.

For example, sometimes you choose a job. Materialism has the power to get you to choose a job. Not one that you love, not one that you're good at,  not one that helps people,  but one that just makes you money. You do it because it'll get you to a certain status in life. And you choose the job on the basis of that.

You know, for five to 10 years,  the adrenaline can keep you going. And then after a while, you just find yourself empty inside. Why did you choose the job? Your eye was dark. I'm not saying everybody does this, but so many people do.

Or let me give you another example. In the conduct of your job, not only can materialism  blind you as you choose your job,  in the conduct of your job. For example, many, many, many, many companies,  many, many companies are making money,  but we all know this. They're hurting neighborhoods. They're hurting towns.

They're hurting people. We know this. Now, there's all sorts of people in the company. And what are they doing? Are they saying, ha ha, in order to make money,  I am ruining the environment of that little town?

Ha ha, no, you're not doing that. What are you doing? You're not asking. You don't want to go there. You don't ask questions.

You don't want to know. You don't want to think out. You don't want to ask hard questions about  is are the deals that my company is making? Are the things that my company is doing? Is this really helping people?

Is it hurting people? Is it helping the town or is it hurting the town? Is it helping the neighborhood? Is it hurting people? You don't want to know.

You don't want to go. That's the blindness. That's what Jesus is talking about. Greed doesn't go ha ha. I am, you know, gouging the poor.

No, but are you asking whether your company is? You need to ask that. If you're not even asking that,  that means the blind eye, the dark eye. Do you see that? Or do it one more.

Materialism keeps you from asking hard questions  about your lifestyle. Now you see, one of the problems with being professionals. If you are, you know, so many of you are professionals. Now, if you, you know, if you go to the bowling alley,  with the other kind of working class people,  by and large everybody there's making the same amount of money. By and large.

However, if you're a professional, one of the problems is  the kinds of people you come into contact with  many, many, many times, sometimes your friends  are making 10 times the money you are. Or people you go to parties with,  or circles that you get into. And there's always somebody. Once you've got that little ticket  into the professional world,  you're constantly rubbing the people you work with. You might have a pretty good job,  but here's a person who's three levels above  and that person's making 10 times,  50 times what you're making.

And therefore you're sure,  at this the reason why, don't forget,  the person who is making, that you think that's person's rich,  that person's making seven figures. They're hanging out with people  who make 10 times more than they do every year. And therefore nobody ever feels rich. You know, there's probably one or two people  that know they're rich, but everybody else makes them feel okay. They probably say I'm rich, you know?

But hardly anybody else does. And you don't ask these questions,  do I really need to spend this much money on this? Do I need to be putting this much money into my apartment? Do I need to be spending this much money for my apartment? Do I, you know, do I need to be spending this much money  on clothes?

And you say, because you, because you compare,  immediately you think of other people who do much more  and therefore you don't ask the question,  you don't go there, you don't ask. You don't say, wait a minute,  isn't there ways in which I could be giving more of my money  to the church, to the poor, to my friends, to the neighbors? Isn't there ways in which I could be much more radical  generous if I made this and that and that change? You don't want to ask, you don't want to think. In 1635, I got named Robert Cain, 1635 now.

I was a member of the first congregational church of Boston. And I think back then there probably only was  one congregational church in Boston, I don't know. I would think. And he was doing pretty well as a businessman,  but in 1635 his elders disciplined him  for the sin of greed. They, I don't think they excommunicated,  I think they suspended him from the Lord's sufferer,  they admonished him.

So his elders disciplined him for the sin of greed. Now, how do they do that? Is because he was selling his product at a 6% profit. And the church had decided three or four years before that  that they were only, Christians were only allowed  to sell their wares at a 4% profit. So when they found out he was doing 6%  they disciplined him for the sin of greed.

Now some of you are out there saying,  where is this illustration going? I'll tell you where it's going. They realized, now this is not as stupid as it sounds. My wife certainly thought it's not as stupid  when I first read it to her,  but I'll tell you why it's not. And I convinced her it wasn't.

You know, she said, where is it saying the Bible 4%? What are you talking about? Well, here, now listen, they knew something  and that is that when you're committing adultery  you know you're committing adultery  but when you're being greedy you never know. And so they sat down as Christians  and they said now look, according to the Bible  Jesus talks about money all the time. He's constantly saying watch out for greed.

He's always saying give your money away. He's always saying don't spend all your money on yourself. I mean, especially in the book of Luke  but all the way through the Gospels, it is frightening. I mean, I can't preach on money  as often as Jesus preached on money. I wouldn't have a church.

I mean, you know, everybody gets so quiet. I mean, nobody walks out singing, you know  and yet Jesus talked about money all the time. So this Congressional Church got together  and said we got a problem here. Some business practices must be greedy. Some lifestyles have to be greedy  but how are we gonna know?

There have to be some. We can't just say well, you know, there have to be some  and so they said all right, as a Christian community  let's sit down and let's just say at our time in our place  in this spot, we can't talk about everything else  but let us decide what is a greedy lifestyle,  what are greedy business practices  and so they got together and by consensus  they decided on summit and they said now  let us hold each other accountable. So it was mutual, it was consensual, you know,  very modern, consensual, everything is okay,  but it's consensual and they got together  and they made this decision and of course he knew about it  but he tried to move past it  and therefore he was right, they were right. Now, I am not saying by any means that today  in our economy you could possibly come up  when you consider how different every field is  you could never come up with a nice simple,  I mean that was a whole different world in so many ways. You couldn't come up with a nice simple rule of thumb  even if you all got together and said look,  we're just gonna do this for ourselves,  you couldn't do that.

But here's the point, who are you accountable to? What Christians have gotten together with you  and mutually you say let's talk about  how we're spending our money on each other on ourselves. How much we're giving away, how much we're keeping  what we're doing. Who has, who have you authorized? What Christians have you authorized to do that  and then you're of course authorized to do it with him.

You have to talk about with somebody,  you've gotta have some standards and you can't trust yourself. That's the principle, you cannot trust yourself  to decide this. And I know what your answer, I know what you're thinking  and I know what I'm thinking and that is,  I don't even think about that, I don't wanna, I don't want,  I don't even wanna think myself about it. When I make, when I spend on money,  I don't even wanna sit down myself and think,  gee, did I really have to do that? I mean not only don't wanna talk to other people  but I don't even talk to myself about it,  I just wanna do it.

And that's Jesus' whole point about greed. Money has the power to keep you from asking questions  about how you spend your money and how you make your money. Money has the power to keep you from asking questions  about how you spend it, how you make it,  the hard questions. Now, why? Why does money have that power?

If that's how it has, I mean that's the power of greed. The power of greed is to not ask. The power of greed is to not think. The power of greed is to say what's not true of me. We live in the most wealthiest society  in a history of the world,  especially the last five to 10 years.

There's never been, right now at least 70% of the wealth  in the whole world is essentially in the hands  of about 5% of the people, which is pretty much America. And we are professionals and if you're a professional in this room,  that means you're in the top 20% of that 5%. There's never been a group of people as wealthy as we are. And here, do we dare? Is there anybody in this room that dares to say,  I really am doing just fine when it comes to material things.

I couldn't give any more way. I couldn't live any more simply. I couldn't be any more generous with my money. I'm pretty generous. The rest of the world knows better.

The rest of the world looks at us and says to Americans,  there's so many things you could be doing in this world. If you just didn't think you had to have that gadget,  there are so many things, the rest of the world sees it. It's astounding that we live in the place we live,  in the time we live and we won't even think about  the possibility that we're greedy. That shows the power of greed. It shows the power of money.

Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer? Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp  the heart of the Christian faith? For many of us, the summer months can provide more time  to deepen our faith and our understanding  of what it means to follow Christ. A great resource to start using this summer  is the new city catacism devotional. God's truth for our hearts and minds.

This devotional brings the historic catacisms  of the Christian Church to life, offering a question  to consider for each week of the year. In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case  for catacases, the rich and communal practice  of learning and memorizing questions and answers  that frame the foundational beliefs of the Christian faith. Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer,  and a brief meditation that will challenge and inspire you. The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors  such as John Piper, Tim Keller, and Kevin D. Young,  as well as historical figures such as Augustine,  John Calvin, and Martin Luther.

This month, in addition to the new city catacism devotional,  we are including a great companion resource,  the new city catacism for kids,  as our thank you for your gift  to help gospel and life share the hope of Christ's love  with people all over the world. So request your copies today at gospelonlife.com slash give. That's gospelonlife.com slash give. Now, here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. Now, that's how.

Why? I'll be real brief about this. Why is it? That money has this power. Well, the answer is in the little verse,  very famous verse, which Jesus says,  where your treasure is, there is your heart also.

What he means by that is this. Money serves the way in which you actually,  the place where your heart really rests,  is revealed by money. So what it means is, money is a way  of getting significance for many of us. For so many people,  I'm not saying it's everybody in this room on this one,  because this changes. But Jesus says, for example,  one of the reasons why we need so much money,  one of the reasons why we spend it on ourselves,  one of the reasons we don't give it away like we should,  is because of money is our significance.

It shows us, for example,  the fact that we're able to live in a certain place,  the fact that we're able to eat certain places,  the fact that we're in certain social circles,  the fact that we can dress in a certain way,  makes us feel we're important. And you know, it's true. We have a tendency to do this. The higher up economically we get,  we don't just look at other people  who are below us economically and say,  oh, you're below me economically,  we say, you're below me. You don't see that happening to yourself?

I mean, you don't have to be very well off. Middle class people in general feel superior to the poor. We do. Oh, we give money and we're sorry for the poor,  we make pity the poor,  but we feel superior to them. And there's no good reason to.

You know, we started the same place that they did  with the same parents they had,  with the same situation they had. Do you really think it'd be that much better? I don't know. But we automatically feel,  when we feel like we're better economically than somebody else,  we feel like we're better. When we're higher caliber or socio-economically,  we feel like we're higher caliber.

It's so automatic, it's so fast. And because money is something that many of us take  and we say that's my significance. That's what makes me feel important. But on the other hand, for other people,  other people are different. And other people take money and make money their security.

See, some people use money for approval,  other people use money for control. Some people use money in order to say I feel important. But many other people say I need money, so I'm safe. Don't forget what I'm saying here. I'm asking this question.

If you're not giving your money away in eye-popping proportions,  if you find it very difficult,  if you're not so radically generous of the world's amazed  at the Christians and most of us are not. Why? One answer is, why has it had that power? One answer is, it's money is your significance,  the other possibilities, money is your security. In other words, you feel like if I got money,  then I have control in an uncontrollable world.

I have control over my life, I have control. You know, I've got, if things come along, I'm safe. And Jesus Christ says,  running after these things cannot add a minute, an hour. They can't add a minute to your life. It's God who's in control of these things.

Money is not going to turn you into God. God, money is not going to be able to get  one little bit of control. One of my professors, Addison Leach, who was the second husband,  he died of Elizabeth Elliot. Elizabeth Elliot, who came here last week. Some of you saw, met her, went to her conference.

And she had two husbands die on her  before she is now married to third time. Her second husband was a professor of mine  and I heard him once tell the story. And he said, he was thinking about this idea  that money can be your security. He had a couple of young women in his,  a couple of young women that where he was a teacher at college  became Christians in college,  and they came back to their parents. And they said, we've become Christians  and we want to be missionaries.

And the parents said, oh no, missionaries. And they said, look, each of them said, now dear,  you've had a religious experience. How wonderful. But you need some security. Before you go off to take your, have your missionary experience,  which is fine, if you want to go, that's fine.

But first we want you to have a master's degree. We want you to have taken a job or two,  so you've got some records,  so you've gotten your career off the ground. And we want you to have some money in the bank  for some security. And they came back to my professor, Dr. Leach,  and they said, what do we say about that?

And Dr. Leach said, oh, here's what I would say  to my dear parents. Tell them, we're on a little ball of rock  spinning through space. It's called Earth. And who knows if we're going to run into something,  but even if we don't someday,  under each one of us is going to open a trap door.

And everybody's going to fall off. I mean, at the end of your life, a trap door opens up  underneath you, and you fall off a little ball of rock,  and underneath will be the everlasting arms  or nothing at all. And you think a master's degree  is going to give you some security. Let's see. And that's what Jesus is saying right here.

He says, the power of money is,  it seems like it can give you significance,  but actually when you make money,  you're significant, you become an arrogant person  that nobody likes. And you think money can give you some security,  but the fact is that money can't possibly stop all the things. It can't stop death, it can't stop tragedy,  it can't stop broken relationships,  it can't stop anything. So how do we break the power of money in our lives? Well, the answer is this.

How do we get to the place where we're really radically generous? How do we get to the place where we're not worrying about money? How do we get to the place where we're not,  we don't feel, you know,  there's a lot of ways in which money controls us. Let's take a look. Verse 19.

Do not stir up for yourselves treasures on earth,  where moth and rust destroy,  where these break in and steal,  but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven,  where moth and rust do not destroy,  and where these do not break in and steal. Now, literally, he says,  don't treasure earthly treasures,  but treasure heavenly treasure. That's what he says. And that's important to know,  everybody at the center of their soul  has something they treasure. What does it mean to treasure something?

It means to look at something,  fill your heart with a beauty and the value of it,  and to treasure something is to say,  if I have this, everything's worth it. If I have this, it's all worth it. And if I have this,  I'm worth it. In other words,  everybody's got something. It might be money, it might be career,  it might be status, it might be romance,  it might be a family,  you're looking at it and it's your treasure.

And you say, if I could have this, it'll all be worth it. Everybody in this room's got something,  something on earth they're doing that about. Everybody, if I had this, it would all be worth it. And then I'd be worth it. My favorite fantasy book, Lord of the Rings,  which I've been rereading recently,  it's all about the special ring,  and it's beautiful,  and whoever owns it,  calls it the precious.

Any of you ever read Lord of the Rings? Everybody who gets this ring,  in a sense comes under its power,  because you look at it,  and everybody who gets it calls it my precious, the precious. And that's what Jesus is saying,  is at the center of everybody's soul,  there's the precious,  something that you've looked at,  and you said,  this is precious to me. This is the thing that if I have,  it's all worth it. This is the thing that if I have it,  then I'm worth it.

You've got something. But whatever that is,  you are enslaved to it. Anything that your soul treasures,  once your soul treasures something,  you will pay any price for it. You will do anything to get it,  because it's the only thing that's worth it. See?

Now, the Bible says,  every treasure but Jesus  will insist that you die to purchase it. But Jesus himself is the one treasure  who died to purchase you. Anything else you make your supreme value,  will say, die for me. But if you make Jesus Christ your supreme value,  he's the one who said,  I've died for you. How do you make Jesus Christ your treasure?

Only if you make him your treasure. Only if he is your heavenly treasure. Only if you treasure him. Well, you actually be in a sense free from money. Now, I'll explain what that means in a second.

But first, how can you treasure Jesus? Think about what he did with his treasure. He had the ultimate treasure. He was the Lord. He had the ultimate status.

And he also had the ultimate security. He was the Son. That was the Father. But when he came to earth,  what happened to him on the cross? He was utterly stripped.

When he was stripped naked  of all of his belongings and all of his possessions,  that was just an echo of the fact that he was spiritually stripped. He lost all of his treasure. Why? He died for something. Now, you only die for that, which is your precious.

And what this means is,  Jesus Christ must have looked at us. And must have said,  if I have them,  even going to hell,  will be worth it. And Isaiah chapter 53 tells us by prophecy  that when he saw the results of his suffering,  he was satisfied. Now, you know,  in 1 Peter 2.9,  it says,  you are a chosen race. He's talking to the Christians.

You are a holy nation. You are a royal priesthood. You are God's purchased possession. That means you are his treasure. Unless you know that he was willing to lose all his treasure  so that you could be his treasure.

Unless you realize that he looked at you  and he felt towards you like that. That he felt  if I have them,  anything's worth. Nothing would be worth losing them. Anything would be worth saving them. You know that he treasures you.

You know he cares about you like that. That and that alone will free you. Absolutely free you from money. It'll free you from everything. It won't just free you from money.

And here's what I mean by free you from money. Some of you,  here's a test. Here's one of the ways you know  that you have spiritual wealth. How do you react to rich people? I'll tell you how most of us do it.

Many of you resent rich people. You feel disdainful of them. You say look at their money. Look at their homes. Look at all this stuff.

And you feel superior to them. And that shows that money still has power over you. If you dislike rich people,  if you feel superior to rich people,  that shows money still got power over you. It shows a lack of spiritual wealth in you. It shows actually a lack of humility.

And the gospel is your center. So you haven't really received it. However, if you envy rich people,  if you can't believe that this person  has let me come into this room  and into this apartment. Look how neat this is. Isn't this incredible?

See, that also shows that money's got power over you. The gospel is you're more sinful than you ever dared believe. You're more loved than you ever dared hope. The more sinful keeps you from feeling superior to rich people. The more loved keeps you from feeling inferior to rich people.

And therefore, the gospel puts you in a place where you really don't care about money anymore. And the best way to see that money had no longer has any power over you  is that you can love rich people. Secondly, the way you can tell that money has no more power over you  is that you also respect for people. That you looked at them and you respect them  and you expect to learn from them  and you don't look down your nose at them. And boy, that's mighty, mighty, mighty hard.

But by and large, there's a tendency, you know,  money still has power over us because we very often we get around poor people. We just really look down our nose at them. You know, you rub, this is New York, fortunately. And in New York, you actually actually do ride subways with poor people. And you see poor people.

I mean, you know, the rest of the country, we just keep, we just get them away. We just get them away. We zone them away. In New York, you can't zone people away. Thank you.

That's great, New York. In some ways, New York is more like the new Jerusalem. A lot of people are going to hate the New Jerusalem because they hate New York. There's not going to be any zoning there. And one of the good things is you are around poor people.

How do you respond to them? One of the ways you can see that money has lost its power over you  because of the gospel of Jesus, because you know that he lost all of his treasure  to make you his treasure. That humbles you, that melts you, that lifts you up. And one of the ways you'll know is that you no longer,  you have no trouble loving rich people. Secondly, you have no trouble loving poor people.

But the third, the third sign that money no longer has power over your life is this. You get really generous. You know what's interesting? Verse 22, the eyes, the lamp of the body, if your eyes are good,  if your eyes are good, that word actually is a double meaning in Greek. The word good also means generous.

And a Christian who's really been freed from money by finding Jesus is their treasure  gets a generous eye. You're always looking and always looking for opportunities. You're looking at your friends, your neighbors, your looking at your church,  you're looking at the poor, you're looking at your city. And you're always looking for ways to give away. You want to say, well, how much?

This is the last thing I'll say. Well, you have to look at what Jesus did. When Jesus treasured you, he treasured you sacrificially. Now, if you want to respond to Jesus, that means that I have got to not just simply  live out the cross of Jesus Christ in my relationships,  I've also got to live out the cross of Jesus Christ economically. Now follow me here.

You know, most every Christian says, oh, I'm a Christian. And therefore, I need to, Jesus died for me and he lived a sacrificial life for me. And therefore, I have to love others as Christ loved me. Fine. That means you have got to give enough money away this year that it sacrifices your lifestyle.

If you give money, but it doesn't really cut into the way in which you live,  it doesn't sacrifice. There's no cross in your economic life. If you don't give enough away enough money so that it really makes a difference  in how you live your life, in your lifestyle, then there's no cross. And you're not really responding to Jesus as he's responded to you. Now, for most of us, I'll tell you this, not yet, for most people, I shouldn't say of us.

For most people, most places in most times in the world, the tithe is the goal. Why? Because most places, most times, most people, the Bible says, give away 10%,  that's a good, nice figure to think about in terms of your giving. That's a good way to tell whether or not the gospel is working in your heart. Because if the gospel is working in your heart and you see what Jesus Christ has done for you,  it doesn't seem like much.

I mean, after all, what if Jesus had tithes as blood, you still be lost. I mean, Jesus went way past the tithe. So the point is 10% doesn't seem like very much. However, for most people, it does mean a sacrifice. There'll be a cross in the 10% for most of us.

For most of us, 10% is really going to be hard. It's going to hurt. But increasingly in America, there are people for whom 10% does not make a dent. And you see, the 10% is not the point. The Bible tells you how much I be giving away.

The 10% is just a rule of thumb. It's just a helping, a good way to get started. The cross is the standard. The 10% is just sort of an example for most of us. But the cross is the standard.

Is there a cross in your life? In your economic life. If Jesus is your treasure, you'll love the rich. If Jesus is your treasure, you'll love the poor. If Jesus is the treasure, you'll be giving your money away joyfully, deliberately, happily.

That's the reason why the early church was so successful. We have an old letter from Diagnetus, who talked about the early Christians. Why they were so popular and why they stunned people. He says, we share our table with all, but we do not share our bed with all. He said, in other words, the pagans are promiscuous with their body, but very stingy with their money.

And Christians are very stingy with their body and incredibly promiscuous with their money. Which kind of person benefited their neighborhood? In other words, would you want to live in a neighborhood? I said this last week, I think. Would you want to live in a neighborhood with a group of people who are stingy with their money?

And very promiscuous with their body? What impact would that have on the neighborhood? If you're a child, where do you want to live? Do you want to live in a neighborhood of people like that? Or do you want to live in a neighborhood of people?

Who practice sexual integrity and financial promiscuity? A city filled with that kind of person is going to be a healthy city. A neighborhood filled with that kind of person is going to be a healthy neighborhood. There are tremendous public ramifications of the Sermon on the Mount. Let's live it.

Let's pray. Our Father, I thank You for giving us this time to consider  what it means to treasure up treasures in heaven. We thank You for what Your Son did for us. We thank You for all of that. And we pray that You would help it become such a reality in our lives that money no longer has power over us.

The intimidation we feel around people who have more money,  or the inferiority we feel, or even the anger we feel,  or the superiority we feel. Oh, Lord, change that so that we are very different kinds of people. We are unique people. You've done it in the past. The early church really understood this.

Let it be true of us, too. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.

### 中文翻译

### 引言：登山宝训

本月的播客中，我们推出了一系列关于登山宝训的讲道，这是耶稣阐述真正基督徒生活意义的一系列教导。在这个系列中，Tim Keller 探讨了一个引人注目的观点，即基督教不仅与世界不同，而且与宗教也有根本的不同。

> "看看你的公告，我们有一段经文是这些教导的基础，我们正在研读登山宝训，现在我们来到耶稣关于金钱和财物的教导，他有很多话要说，超过我们能涵盖的，但让我们来读一下。"

**马太福音 6: 不要为自己积攒财宝在地上，地上有虫子咬，能锈坏，也有贼挖窟窿来偷。只要积攒财宝在天上，天上没有虫子咬，不能锈坏，也没有贼挖窟窿来偷。因为你的财宝在哪里，你的心也在哪里。**

### 金钱如何对我们施加影响

耶稣在这里告诉我们三件事。他告诉我们金钱如何控制我们，如何对我们施加影响。

#### 1. 眼睛是身体的灯

眼睛是身体的灯。你的眼睛若了亮，全身就光明；你的眼睛若昏花，全身就黑暗。你里头的光若黑暗了，那黑暗是何等大呢？

> "没有人能侍奉两个主。他不是恶这个爱那个，就是重这个轻那个。你们不能又侍奉神，又侍奉玛门。"

### 金钱为何对我们有影响

#### 1. 金钱作为意义

金钱是你心灵真正安息之处的体现。对许多人来说，金钱是一种获得意义的方式。

#### 2. 金钱作为安全感

有些人用金钱来获得认可，另一些人用金钱来获得控制。有些人用金钱来证明自己很重要，但许多人说我需要钱，所以我才安全。

### 如何打破金钱的影响力

#### 1. 珍视耶稣

圣经说，除了耶稣之外的每一个珍宝都会要求你为之付出生命。但耶稣自己是那个为你付出生命的珍宝。

> "你如何让耶稣基督成为你的珍宝？只有当你让他成为你的珍宝时，只有当他是你的天上珍宝时，只有当你珍视他时。"

#### 2. 慷慨作为标志

如果耶稣是你的珍宝，你会爱富人。如果耶稣是你的珍宝，你会爱穷人。如果耶稣是珍宝，你会愉快地、有计划地、快乐地把钱捐出去。

### 结论

我们的父神，我感谢你赐给我们这个时间来思考什么是积攒天上的财宝。我们感谢你儿子为我们所做的一切。我们祈求你帮助这些成为我们生活中的现实，使金钱不再对我们有影响力。

> "我们在有钱人面前感到的恐惧，或我们感到的自卑，甚至是我们感到的愤怒，或我们感到的优越感。哦，主啊，改变这一切，使我们成为非常不同的人。"

**我们是独特的人。你过去已经做到这一点。早期教会真正理解了这一点。愿这也成为我们的真实。我们奉耶稣的名祷告。阿门。**

## Chinese Transcript / 中文

我们现在的系列是关于耶稣的教导，我们在查考《登山宝训》。今天来到耶稣对金钱和财物的教导。他在这方面说了很多，比我们今天能讲的多得多。但我们还是先来读经文。《马太福音》第 6 章：

“不要为自己积攒财宝在地上，地上有虫子咬，能锈坏，也有贼挖窟窿来偷；只要积攒财宝在天上，天上没有虫子咬，不能锈坏，也没有贼挖窟窿来偷。因为你的财宝在哪里，你的心也在哪里。

眼睛就是身上的灯。你的眼睛若了亮，全身就光明；你的眼睛若昏花，全身就黑暗。你里头的光若黑暗了，那黑暗是何等大呢！”

“一个人不能侍奉两个主；不是恶这个爱那个，就是重这个轻那个。你们不能又侍奉神，又侍奉玛门。

所以我告诉你们，不要为生命忧虑吃什么、喝什么；为身体忧虑穿什么。生命不胜于饮食吗？身体不胜于衣裳吗？

你们看那天上的飞鸟，也不种，也不收，也不积蓄在仓里，你们的天父尚且养活它。你们不比飞鸟贵重得多吗？

你们哪一个能用思虑使寿数多加一刻呢？何必为衣裳忧虑呢？你想野地里的百合花怎么长起来，它也不劳苦，也不纺线。然而我告诉你们，就是所罗门极荣华的时候，他所穿戴的，还不如这花一朵呢！

你们这小信的人哪！野地里的草今天还在，明天就丢在炉里，神尚且这样给它穿戴，何况你们呢？所以不要忧虑说：吃什么？喝什么？穿什么？这都是外邦人所求的。你们需用的这一切东西，你们的天父是知道的。

你们要先求他的国和他的义，这些东西都要加给你们了。

所以，不要为明天忧虑，因为明天自有明天的忧虑，一天的难处一天当就够了。”——这是上帝的话。

《登山宝训》在讲：如果我们真的把福音——也就是耶稣基督的核心信息——活出来，生命会变成什么样？这就是《登山宝训》的主题。而现在我们来到金钱和财物这一块。

在这里耶稣告诉我们三件事，我们可以从经文中抽出来。他告诉我们金钱如何控制我们——也就是它如何对我们施加影响、行使权势。所以，第一，金钱是如何在我们身上施展权势的；第二，为什么金钱有这样的权势；第三，我们怎样可以打破这种权势。

所以是三点：金钱如何掌权，为什么能掌权，以及我们怎样打破它的权势。

先来看第一点：金钱如何在我们身上施展权势。有一件事一直让解经的人，或者任何读这段经文、想弄懂它的人感到困惑，就是这里关于“眼睛”的比喻、这句小小的说法。

他说：眼睛是身上的灯；你的眼睛若了亮，全身就光明；你的眼睛若昏花，全身就黑暗。这个意思其实很简单。我们现在在这个房间里，这里有光。如果你的眼睛是好的，也就是能把光线接进来，你就能借着光在房间里移动你的身体——你会看见门在哪里，就往那边走，你不会跌倒、不会绊倒。

这句比喻基本上要说明的是：如果你的眼睛失明了，尽管你身体的其他部分周围有许多光，你整个人却仍然处在黑暗中。如果你的眼睛不工作，从某种意义上说，你身体的任何别的部位都不能“看见”或把光线接进来。所以，如果你的眼睛失明了，你整个人就在黑暗里，不管这房间是不是被光照得再亮。

于是你会说——读到这里你会问——“这和前后文有什么关系呢？”如果你往下看就会发现，19 到 21 节完全在讲金钱；24 节以及后面也在讲金钱。那这句关于眼睛的话插在中间是做什么的呢？

如果你翻到《路加福音》11 章、12 章，就更容易理解他的意思了。在路加 11—12 章里，耶稣也用到同样的讨论和比喻：‘眼睛是身上的灯，你的眼睛若昏花，你全身就黑暗。’他同样在讲钱，而且两者再次被连在一起。当你读到路加 12 章，看到他讲完“眼睛和灯”的比喻，就说：‘你们要谨慎自守，免去一切的贪心。’那是在路加 12 章。他说：‘你们要谨慎自守，防备各样的贪心。’

这非常有意思。他在说什么呢？他在说，贪心和物质主义——所谓物质主义，就是对金钱和物质有超过应有的渴望或依赖，对金钱和物质有不相称的、过度的渴求或倚靠——这样的物质主义有一个特别的效应：它会在属灵上弄瞎你，扭曲你看一切事物的方式。它有一种力量，会影响你看待所有东西的眼光。

我意思是什么呢？让我给你一些例子。

首先，物质主义有能力让你对“物质主义”这件事本身视而不见。耶稣在这里所说的非常有意思。让我换个角度来说。有些年前，我的妻子凯西注意到，我每个月早上都会在一个男人早餐会里讲道，做一系列关于“七宗罪”的信息。你知道，“七宗罪”包括情欲、骄傲、嫉妒、暴怒等等。当然，其中一个就是“贪婪”。

凯西说：“他们有打广告吗？就是说，把主题提前告诉大家，让他们可以带朋友来？”我说：“对，有的，他们会提前宣传主题。”

她说：“所以大家会知道哪一个月是讲‘贪婪’的？”我说：“对，会知道。”

她说：“你注意看，那个月出席人数一定会掉下去，一定会往下掉。他们不会愿意出来听关于贪婪的讲道。”结果她说对了，完全正确。那一次是所有聚会里出席率最低的一次。

我后来想了想，为什么会这样？原因不是因为大家敌对、反感这个主题。不是说有人会说：“哦，这太糟糕了，我才不要听贪婪呢。”不是的。大家只是非常非常确信：这和我没关系，不发生在我身上。

换句话说，这个罪跟其他罪不一样。这就是为什么耶稣说这是“眼睛的罪”。它让你的属灵眼睛昏暗。耶稣从来不会对人说：“你们要当心，免得你们不知不觉犯了奸淫。”如果你在犯奸淫，你绝对知道自己在犯奸淫。你不会突然说：“噢，你不是我妻子？”事情不会那样发生。

但耶稣却必须说：“你们要谨慎自守，免去一切的贪心。”为什么？因为贪心会隐藏自己，它使你失明，是奸淫做不到的。奸淫这件事，你若在做，你是知道的。

作为一名牧师，多年来有许多人来找我谈他们的罪，向我承认他们所犯的罪。他们会说：“牧师，我有一个非常严重的问题，有些事不对劲。我从没跟别人承认过，但你是那种牧师／祭司／拉比式的人物，所以我想跟你说。”于是他们会向我谈愤怒、苦毒、情欲、骄傲，什么都谈——但我几乎不记得有谁走进来说：“牧师，我是个贪财的人，我物质主义严重。”几乎没有人这样来认这个罪。

他们不会说：“牧师，我太物质主义了。”从来没有。就是这样。

所以现在我知道这意味着什么。耶稣在说的是：你根本不会去问，你不会去想自己是不是贪婪。你从不认为自己是。你会说：“我？贪婪？”你想到的是那些“富人”，想到那些花钱大手大脚的人。

问题在于，你们每个人身边都有朋友，事实上，多数人甚至有亲戚，比你挥霍得多得多。只要你认识一个真正非常贪婪的人，你就不会再觉得自己贪婪了，甚至连考虑都不会考虑自己是不是物质主义者——你根本不会觉得这种可能性存在。这就是他们那次出席率低的原因——不是因为他们觉得无聊，而是他们觉得“这不适用于我”。

你看，这就是“眼睛的黑暗”。如果你今天在这里，心里在想：“这根本不是我的问题。”那反而是一个非常糟糕的征兆。这就是其中一种罪，其症状之一就是：你绝对确信这不是我的问题。

因此，耶稣说：“你们要谨慎。”这是“眼睛的罪”，它使你的眼睛昏暗。

比如，我再给一些例子。物质主义可以让你在选择工作时变得盲目。它可以让你选工作时，不是根据你是否热爱这份工作，不是根据你是否擅长、是否能够祝福别人，而是单单因为这份工作能让你挣更多的钱。你选择这份工作，是因为它可以把你带到某个社会地位上。

你就是这样选工作的。五到十年间，肾上腺素还能勉强推动你往前冲，但再过一段时间，你就会发现自己里面是空的。你会问：我为什么当初要选这份工作呢？那时你的眼睛就是昏暗的。我不是说每个人都这样，但太多人是这样。

再给一个例子，不只是你选工作时会被蒙蔽，在你实际工作的过程中，物质主义也会弄瞎你的眼睛。

举例说，许多许多公司都在赚钱——这点我们都知道。但同时，我们也知道，他们正在伤害某些社区、某些城镇、某些人群。我们都知道这一点。

现在，公司里面有各式各样的人，他们在做什么？他们会说：“哈哈，为了赚钱，我要毁掉那个小镇的环境。”吗？当然不会。你在做的是什么？你其实是不问。你不愿意问那些问题，你不愿意往那里想。你不愿意认真问：我所在的公司，现在做的这些交易、这些事情，真的在造福人吗？还是在伤害人？

这到底是在祝福一个城镇，还是在破坏一个城镇？是在祝福一个社区，还是在伤害一个社区？你不想知道，你不想往那边想。这就是“眼睛的昏暗”，这就是耶稣说的那种盲目。贪婪不会说：“哈哈，我正在欺压穷人。”不会。但问题是，你有没有问：我的公司是不是在这么做？你需要问这个问题。如果你连问都不问，那就说明你的眼睛是黑暗的。你看到了吗？

我再举一个例子。物质主义会使你不愿意对自己的生活方式提出尖锐的问题。

你看，作“专业人士”有一个问题。如果你经常去保龄球馆之类的地方，跟其他蓝领或工人阶层的人一起，大致而言，那里的每个人收入差不多，总体上大家都差不多。

然而，如果你是专业人士，就不一样了。你接触到的人、你周围的人，很多时候，你的朋友收入可能是你的十倍。你去参加的派对、进入的社交圈子里，总会有人。只要你拿到了“专业阶层”的门票，很多时候，你身边一起工作的人，也许你自己已经有一份不错的工作了，但你会看到某个人在你之上三四级，他的收入是你的十倍、五十倍。

因此，你就很确定——当你想到那个人的时候——你会觉得：“那才是有钱人。”

问题是，那位你觉得“很有钱”的人，年收入七位数的人，他身边也有朋友，比他收入高十倍的人。于是几乎没有人觉得自己是“富人”。也许只有一两个人知道自己真的很富有，但其他所有人都让他们感到“我还好，我还算普通”。他们可能会在内心说：“是，我是有钱。”但几乎没有别人会承认。

你因此就不会问这些问题：我真的需要在这件事情上花这么多钱吗？我真的需要在我的公寓上投放这么多的钱吗？我真的需要为了公寓花这么多？我真的需要在衣服上花这么多钱吗？你立刻就会拿别人来比较，你马上想到那些花更多的人，于是你不再问这些问题，你不去那儿，你不思考。

你不会问：“等一下，我有没有可能在教会、在穷人、在朋友、在邻舍身上多奉献一些？如果我在这件事、那件事、那件事上做一些调整，我能不能在金钱上更激进地慷慨？”你不想问，你不想思考。

1635 年，有一个叫罗伯特·凯恩（Robert Cain）的人，1635 年，他是波士顿第一公理会教堂的会友。我想那时候波士顿可能也就这一间公理会教堂吧。我猜是这样。

他做生意做得不错，是个生意人。但 1635 年，他的长老们因为“贪婪之罪”对他施行了教会管教。我想他们没有把他逐出教会，但暂停了他领圣餐的资格，并且严厉劝戒他。

那么，他们是怎么认定他犯了“贪婪”的？是因为他把自己的产品以 6% 的利润卖出去。而教会在三四年前曾经讨论决定，基督徒卖货时利润只能拿 4%。所以当他们发现他拿 6% 的利润时，就以“贪婪之罪”管教了他。

你们当中有些人现在心里在想：这个例子要讲到哪里去？我来告诉你。其实这件事一点都不像看上去那么愚蠢。我妻子第一次听我给她读这个故事时，当然觉得这太荒谬了。但后来我说服她：其实没那么蠢。

你看，他们明白一件事，那就是：当你犯奸淫的时候，你知道自己在犯奸淫；但当你贪婪的时候，你永远不知道自己贪婪。所以他们作为基督徒坐下来，讨论说：看，按照圣经，耶稣一直在谈钱，一直在说“要防备贪心”，一直在说“要把钱给出去”，一直在说“不要把所有钱都花在自己身上”。尤其是在《路加福音》里贯穿始终，甚至整个福音书都是这样。那些经文是令人害怕的。

老实说，我根本不能像耶稣那样频繁地讲钱这个话题。如果我像耶稣那样频率地讲奉献，恐怕我教会就没人了。你知道的，一讲到钱，大家就安静下来，没人会唱着歌离开礼拜堂。但耶稣却一直谈钱。

所以这间公理会教堂就坐下来，说：我们有个问题。一定有一些商业操守是贪婪的，一定有一些生活方式就是贪婪的——但我们怎么知道哪些算是呢？总不能说“随便怎样都行”吧？一定要有一些界线。

于是他们说，好，我们作为一个基督徒群体，坐下来，在我们的时代、我们的位置、在此时此地——我们没办法替所有地方做决定，但就为我们这里——来决定什么样的生活方式是贪婪的，什么样的商业行为是贪婪的。于是他们聚在一起，通过共识，拟定了某些原则。然后他们说：好，现在让我们彼此监督。

这是双方的，是大家同意的——你看，这其实很“现代”：强调共识。大家同意了这些原则，他当然也知道这原则的存在。但他后来试图绕过去，于是教会就管教了他，而教会这样做是对的。

我并不是说，在今天的经济环境之下，我们还能这么做。考虑到如今每个行业差别巨大，你根本不可能列出一条简单的、像当年那样的规则。那是完全不一样的世界。在今天，即便一群基督徒坐下来说：“我们只给自己订这样的原则。”你也很难得出那么明确的条文。

但重点在这里：那你向谁负责？有哪些基督徒与你坐下来，彼此约定说：我们一起来谈，看看我们怎样花钱在自己和彼此身上，我们奉献多少，自己留多少，我们在做什么？你授权了哪些基督徒可以这样问你，同时你也被授权去问他们？你必须和某些人谈这个，你必须要有一些标准，而且你不能信任自己一个人的判断——这就是原则。你不能信靠自己在这件事上的判断。

我很清楚你在想什么——其实我自己也会这样想——那就是：我甚至不想去想这些。我不想。我甚至不想自己坐下来想：“哎呀，我真的非得花这笔钱吗？”我不想跟别人谈，也不想跟自己谈。我只想花就花。

这正是耶稣所说的“贪婪的能力”。金钱的能力就在这里：它让你不去问问题，关于你如何赚钱、如何花钱的那些问题，它让你不去问；它让你不去思想；它让你说：“这根本不是我的问题。”

我们生活在历史上最富裕的社会里，尤其是过去五到十年，从未有过像这样富裕的群体。如今全世界大约 70% 的财富基本集中在 5% 的人手里，而这 5% 差不多就是美国。我们又是专业人士，如果你在座是专业人士，那么你大概处在这 5% 之中前 20% 的位置。

历史上从来没有一群人像我们现在这样富有。而我们就在这样的地方、这样的年代生活。有人敢说：“在金钱方面，我做得已经很好了。我实在不能再多给了，不能再简朴了，不能再慷慨了。我已经相当慷慨了。”吗？

全世界的其他地方都很清楚事实不是这样。全世界的人看着我们美国人，说：如果你们不觉得非要买那个新玩意儿，如果你们不觉得一定要拥有那些东西，你们其实可以在这个世界上做太多事情。外面的人都看得很清楚。

我们活在这样的地方、这样的时代，却连“我是不是贪婪？”这个可能性都不愿意思考——这就显出贪婪的权势有多大，显出金钱的权势有多大。

同样的讨论，他在《路加福音》中也用作比喻：眼睛是身上的灯，你的眼睛若黑暗，你全身就黑暗。

他同时也在讲钱，再一次，这两者是连在一起的。到了路加 12 章，你会看到，他在讲完“眼睛和灯”的比喻之后，说：“你们要谨慎自守，免去一切的贪心。”那段就在路加 12 章。他说：“要提防贪心，要留心各种形式的贪心。”

那么，他到底在说什么呢？这非常有意思。他在说，贪心和物质主义——所谓物质主义，就是对金钱和物质有不相称的渴望或依赖，对金钱和物质有一种“过度”的欲望或倚靠——这种物质主义有一个独特的效应，就是让你在属灵上瞎眼，扭曲你看待事物的方式。它有能力操控你看待一切东西的眼光。

那我是什么意思呢？好，让我给你一些例子。

首先，物质主义有能力使你对“物质主义”本身视而不见。耶稣在这里的说法非常有意思。让我换一种角度来说。多年前，我的妻子凯西注意到，我每个月早上都会在一个男人早餐会里讲道，做一个关于“七宗罪”的系列。你知道，“七宗罪”包括情欲、骄傲、嫉妒、愤怒等等。当然，其中之一就是“贪婪”。

凯西就问：“他们有打广告吗？就是说，会不会提前把主题写出来，让大家能带朋友来？”我说：“有啊，他们会宣传主题。”

她说：“所以，他们会知道哪一个月的主题是‘贪婪’？”我说：“对，会知道。”

她说：“那你看着吧，那个月出席人数会掉下来，一定会往下掉。他们不会愿意见证来听关于贪婪的讲道。”

结果她是对的，完全正确。那一场是所有聚会里出席率最低的一次。后来我想了想，为什么会这样？我告诉你，不是因为他们敌对这个题目，并不是有人说：“哦这真是个糟糕的主意，我才不愿意谈贪婪呢，我才不想听关于贪婪的讲道。”不是的。

每个人都非常非常确信：贪婪这事不关我的事，不在我身上。不发生在我身上。换句话说，这个罪不同于其他的罪。这就是为什么耶稣说，这是“眼睛的罪”。

它使你的眼睛在属灵上变得昏暗。

你从来不用对一个人说：“小心啊，你可能在犯奸淫呢。”耶稣从来没有这样提醒任何人。如果你在犯奸淫，你自己知道。你不会突然说：“咦，你不是我妻子？”事情不会那样发生。

但耶稣却必须说：“你们要谨慎自守，免去一切的贪心。”

你看，因为贪婪会隐藏自己，它让你失明，是奸淫做不到的。奸淫这件事，如果你在做，你是知道的。

这么多年来，作为一名牧师，我常常遇到人来找我谈他们的罪，来认罪。他们会说：“牧师，我有一个非常严重的问题，有些事情不对。我从没跟别人承认过，但你是那种牧师／祭司／拉比型的人物，我想跟你说。”于是他们来了，会谈愤怒，会谈苦毒，会谈情欲，会谈骄傲，什么都谈。

但我不记得曾有谁走进来说：“牧师，我是个贪婪的人。”我几乎不记得有人说：“牧师，我太物质主义了。”没有人这样做。为什么？因为贪婪有这样的特性。

现在我明白耶稣的意思：耶稣在说，你根本不会问，你从不会认真考虑“我是不是贪婪”。你压根不觉得自己是。你会说：“我？贪婪？”你想到的是那些“有钱人”，想到那些花钱极其奢侈的人。

问题在于，你们都有朋友，事实上，多数人甚至有亲戚，比你挥霍得多。这就足够了。只要你认识一个真正很贪婪的人，你就完全不会认为自己贪婪。你连自己可能是物质主义者都不会去想。你连这种可能性都不会考虑。

这就是为什么当时那场“贪婪”的讲座几乎没人来——不是因为他们觉得无聊，而是因为他们觉得：“这和我无关，这不适用于我。”

所以你看，这就是“眼睛”的问题。如果你今晚坐在这里，心里在想：“这根本不是我的问题。”那反而是一个很糟糕的征兆。

这是那种“一个症状就是：我非常确定这不关我的事”的罪之一。因此，耶稣说：“要警醒，要留意。”这是“眼睛的罪”，它使你的眼睛昏暗。

举个例子，让我再说几种它如何使你眼睛昏暗的情况。

比如，有时候你在选择工作时。物质主义有能力让你选一份工作，并不是因为你爱这份工作，不是因为你擅长，不是因为它可以帮助人，而只是因为它能让你赚更多的钱。你之所以做，是因为它能带你进入某种社会地位。你就是基于这个理由挑选工作的。

前五到十年，肾上腺素还能支撑你往前冲；但再过一些年，你心里会发现自己非常空虚。你会问：我当初为什么要选这份工作？那时候你的眼睛是黑暗的。我并不是说所有人都这样，但太多人是这样了。

再给一个例子。不仅在你选工作的时候，物质主义可以让你的眼睛失明，在你实际做工作的过程中也是如此。

比如，许许多多公司都在赚钱——这一点我们都知道。但我们同样知道，他们正在伤害社区、伤害城镇、伤害人。我们明明知道这一点。

公司里有各种不同的人，他们在做什么呢？他们会说：“哈哈，为了赚钱，我就是要毁掉那个小镇的环境。”吗？当然不会。那么他们在做什么？他们只是“不问”。他们不愿意走到那一步，不问问题。

他们不想知道，不想往下想，不想问这些尖锐的问题：我所在公司正在做的交易、正在推进的事情，真的是在造福人吗？还是在伤害人？是在帮助这个城镇，还是在破坏这个城镇？是在祝福这个社区，还是在伤害这里的人？

他们不愿意知道，不愿意走到那儿去。这就是“盲目”。这正是耶稣所说的。贪婪不会说：“哈哈，我正在盘剥穷人。”不会。但问题是：你有没有问，你的公司是不是在这么做？

你需要问这个问题。如果你连问都不问，那就说明你的眼睛是盲的，是黑暗的。你看明白吗？

我再举一个。物质主义会让你不愿意对自己的生活方式提出尖锐的问题。

你看，作“专业人士”有一个问题。你们当中许多人是专业人士。如果你经常去保龄球馆之类的地方，跟其他工人阶层一起，大体而言，那里的每个人收入差不多，总体上大家的工资水平都差不多。

然而，如果你是专业人士，就不一样了。你接触到的人、你所在的圈子，很多时候，你的朋友收入可能是你的十倍。你去参加的聚会、进入的社交圈子，总会有人——只要你拿到了“专业阶层”的门票——你天天跟你一起工作的人当中，有些人虽然你自己也有不错的工作，但有人在你之上好几级，他的收入是你的十倍、五十倍。

因此，每当你想到那个人时，就会觉得：“那才是有钱人。”

问题是，你心中认定的那个“有钱人”，那位年收入七位数的人，他身边也有朋友，收入是他的十倍。于是几乎没有人觉得自己是“富人”。也许只有一两个人知道自己真的非常富有，但其他所有人都让他们感到自己“还好”。他们也许会说：“是，我是有钱。”但几乎没有别人会认同。

于是你就不会问这些问题：我真的需要在这件事情上花这么多钱吗？我真的需要在我的公寓上投入这么多钱吗？我真的需要为了公寓花这么多？我真的需要在衣服上花这么多钱吗？

你立刻拿别人来比较，你马上想到那些花更多的人，于是你不再问这些问题，你不往那边想，不思考。你不会问：“等一下，我有没有可能在教会、在穷人、在朋友、在邻舍身上给得更多？如果我在这件事、那件事、那件事上做一些调整，我能不能在金钱上更加激进地慷慨？”你不愿意问，不愿意想。

于是，在 1635 年，有个叫罗伯特·凯恩（Robert Cain）的人——那是 1635 年——他是波士顿第一公理会教堂的会友。我想当时波士顿大概也就这一间公理会教堂吧，我猜是这样。

他作为一名商人，做得相当不错。但在 1635 年，他的长老们因为“贪婪之罪”对他实行了教会管教。我想他们没有把他逐出教会，而是暂停他领圣餐的资格，并严厉劝戒他。

所以，他的长老们因为“贪婪之罪”管教了他。那么，他们是怎么判定他“贪婪”的呢？原因是，他以 6% 的利润出售自己的产品。而教会在三四年前曾决定：基督徒卖货时，只能收 4% 的利润。因此，当他们发现他拿 6% 的利润时，就以“贪婪之罪”来管教他。

你们当中有些人现在一定在想：这个例子到底想说明什么？我来告诉你。

他们意识到一些事——这并不像听起来那么愚蠢。我妻子第一次听我给她读这个故事时，当然觉得“太傻了”，但我要告诉你它为什么不傻，后来我也说服了她。

你知道，她说：“圣经哪里写着要 4%？你在说什么？”

好，现在听。那些人知道一件事，那就是：当你犯奸淫时，你知道自己在犯奸淫；但当你贪婪时，你却从来不知道自己贪婪。因此，作为一群基督徒，他们坐下来，说：好，按照圣经，耶稣一直在谈钱。他不停在说：“要提防贪心。”他不停在说：“要把钱给出去。”他不停在说：“别把所有钱都花在自己身上。”

特别是在《路加福音》里，但其实整本福音书都是这样——这些经文是让人感到害怕的。老实讲，我根本不能像耶稣那样频率地讲钱这个主题。如果我像耶稣那样频繁地讲钱，恐怕教会里就没什么人愿意留下来。你知道，一讲到钱，大家就安静下来，没有人是唱着歌走出礼拜堂的。

然而，耶稣却不断谈钱。

于是这间公理会教堂的人坐下来，说：我们遇到问题了。一定有一些商业行为就是贪婪的，一定有一些生活方式就是贪婪的——那我们怎么知道哪些算是呢？总不能说“都可以”，总得有一些是“越界”的。

他们就说：好，作为一个基督徒团体，让我们坐下来，在我们这个时代、这个地点、此时此地——我们没办法替所有地方做决定——但就为我们这里，来决定什么样的生活方式算贪婪，什么样的商业行为算贪婪。

于是他们聚在一起，通过共识拟定了一些标准，然后说：好，现在让我们彼此监督。

这是双方的，是大家同意的——你看，这其实挺“现代”的：一切都讲究“共识”。他们聚在一起，做了这个决定。当然，他也知道有这条规则存在，但他试图绕过去，于是教会管教了他，而这么做是对的。

我并不是说，在今天的经济环境中，你还可能做出类似简单的规定。只要一想到如今各个行业差别如此巨大，你就会明白：你没法制定一条简单的、适用于所有人的“经验法则”。那是一个在许多方面完全不同的世界。即便现在你们一群基督徒坐下来，说：“我们只给自己订这样的原则。”你依然很难制定出那么简单明了的条例。

但重点在这里：那你现在向谁负责？有哪些基督徒与你坐在一起，彼此约定说：“来，我们一起谈谈，我们如何花钱在彼此和自己身上，我们奉献多少，我们留多少，我们在做些什么。”

是谁——你授权了哪些基督徒——可以来问你这些问题？当然，你也被授权去问他们这些问题。你必须和某些人谈论这件事。你必须要有一些标准，而且你不能信任自己单独的判断——这就是原则。你不能信靠自己来决定这件事。

我知道你的答案，我知道你在想什么——其实我自己也会这样想——那就是：我根本不想去想这些。我不想。我甚至不想自己坐下来想：“哎呀，我真的非得花这笔钱吗？”

我不想跟别人谈这件事，更不想连自己都跟自己谈。我只想想花就花。

而这正是耶稣讲到贪婪时要指出的重点。金钱有这样的权势：它让你不去问这些问题，不问你是如何花钱、不问你是如何赚钱。

金钱有能力使你避开这些问题——关于你如何花钱、如何赚钱的那些尖锐问题。它让你不去问，让你不去思考。

那么，为什么？为什么金钱有这样的力量？如果说这就是贪婪的能力——它的能力就是让你不去问，让你不去想，让你说：“这不关我的事。”那为什么金钱能有这样的能力呢？

为什么金钱有这种能力？

答案在那节非常有名的话里：耶稣说：“因为你的财宝在哪里，你的心也在哪里。”

他的意思是：金钱其实在揭示一个事实——你真正心所安息之处、你心真正所倚靠的东西，是借着金钱显露出来的。换句话说，金钱对许多人来说，是获得“重要感”的方式。

对很多人而言，我不是说对在座所有人，而是对很多很多人，情况是这样的：钱让他们觉得自己有价值。比如，能够住在某个地段，能够在某些地方吃饭，能够进入某些社交圈，能够以某种方式打扮自己——这一切让我们觉得自己“重要”。

你知道，我们有这种倾向：当我们在经济上高过别人时，我们不只是说：“哦，我在经济上比你高一点。”我们会说：“我比你高一等。”你没有在自己身上看到这种倾向吗？

其实你不需要非常有钱。一般中产阶级的人，通常都觉得自己优于穷人。我们会这样。哦，是的，我们会给穷人捐款，我们也会为他们感到难过，我们会怜悯穷人，但我们还是会觉得自己比他们高一等。而客观上并没有什么充分理由支撑这种优越感。

如果我们从跟他们相同的起点出发，拥有跟他们一样的父母、一样的成长环境，你真的相信自己会做得比他们好很多吗？我不确定。但我们很自然地——完全下意识地——当我们经济上比别人高一点时，我们就觉得整个人“高”过那个人。

这种反应太自动了，太快了。因为对许多人而言，金钱就是他们的“重要感”来源——这就是让他们觉得自己有价值的东西。

另一方面，有些人不同。对他们而言，钱不是“认可感”，而是“安全感”。有的人用金钱来获得别人的认可，有的人则用金钱来获得掌控感。

有的人会说：“只要我有钱，我就觉得自己重要。”而另一些人则说：“我需要钱，好让我有安全感。”

换句话说，他们觉得：只要我有钱，在这个不可控的世界里，我就有一点控制权。我可以掌控自己的生活，我可以掌控局势；如果有什么事情发生，我有钱在手，我就“安全”。

而耶稣基督却说，追逐这一切，根本不能为你的人生增加哪怕一刻钟。你们记得他在这里说的：“你们哪一个能用思虑使寿数多加一刻呢？”

掌管你生命长短的，是上帝。掌管你人生际遇的，是上帝。钱不会把你变成上帝。钱没有能力给你哪怕一点点真正的掌控力。

贪婪的能力，就是让你不去问。贪婪的能力，就是让你不去想。贪婪的能力，就是让你说：“这事跟我没关系，不是真的发生在我身上。”

我们生活在历史上最富有的社会里，尤其是过去五到十年，从未有过这样。现在，全世界至少 70% 的财富基本集中在大约 5% 的人手里，而这 5% 基本就是美国。而我们还是专业人士，如果你在座是一名专业人士，那就意味着你处在这 5% 当中的前 20%。历史上从未有过一群人像我们这样富有。

而在这样的环境下，有谁敢说：“在物质方面，我已经做得相当好了。我不可能再多给了，我不可能再过得更简朴了，我不可能再更慷慨了。我已经挺慷慨的了。”呢？

世界其他地方都很清楚事实不是这样。世界其他地方的人看着我们美国人，对我们说：“你们本可以在这个世界上做太多事情，只要你们不觉得非要拥有那个新玩意儿不可。”他们很清楚地看见这一切。我们所处的地方、所处的时代如此特别，而我们却连“我是不是贪婪？”这个可能性都不愿去想——这就显出贪婪的权势有多大，显出金钱的权势有多深。

你在寻找今年夏天信仰成长的路径吗？或者，你希望帮助一些初信者或孩子抓住基督教信仰的核心吗？对许多人来说，夏天往往提供了更多时间，让我们更深入地认识信仰、明白跟随基督意味着什么。

有一个很适合今年夏天开始使用的好资源，就是《新城要理问答灵修本》（The New City Catechism Devotional）——“神给我们心与意的真理”。

这本灵修书把教会历史上的要理问答重新“活”了起来，为一年中的每一周提供一个问题，让你反复思想。在引言中，提姆·凯勒阐述了“要理教导”（catechesis）的价值——那是教会一个丰富而群体性的传统：通过学习和背诵问与答，把基督教信仰最核心的真理安放在我们心里。

每一周都有一段经文、一段祷告，以及一段简短却富有挑战和激励意义的默想。这本书中收录的注释既有当代牧者的，如约翰·派博（John Piper）、提姆·凯勒（Tim Keller）、凯文·德扬（Kevin DeYoung），也有教会历史中重要人物的，如奥古斯丁（Augustine）、约翰·加尔文（John Calvin）、马丁·路德（Martin Luther）。

——刚才我们讲了金钱“如何”在我们身上施展权势。

那么，“为什么”呢？我在这里会讲得很简短。为什么金钱有这样的力量？

答案就在那节非常有名的经文里：耶稣说，“因为你的财宝在哪里，你的心也在哪里。”

他的意思是：金钱其实在揭示一个事实——你真正心所安息之处、你心真正所倚靠的东西，是借着金钱显露出来的。

换句话说，金钱对我们许多人来说，是获得“重要感”的方式。对如今世上的许多人而言（我不是说你们当中每一个人都这样，这也会因人而异），情况通常是这样的：耶稣说，我们之所以需要那么多钱，我们之所以把那么多钱花在自己身上，我们之所以没像应该那样慷慨地给出去，其中一个重要的原因是：我们把金钱当作我们的“重要感”来源。

例如，能够住在某个地段，能够在某些地方吃饭，能够进入某些社交圈，能够以某种方式打扮自己——这些让我们觉得自己“重要”。

你知道，这确实是事实。我们确实倾向于这样做：当我们在经济上比别人高时，我们不只是说：“哦，我在经济上比你高一点。”我们会说：“我比你高一档。”

你没有在自己身上看到这种倾向吗？你其实不需要特别富有，一般的中产阶级人群，通常就会觉得自己优于穷人。我们就是这样。哦，我们会奉献，会为穷人感到难过，会怜悯穷人，但我们仍然会觉得自己在他们之上。而实际上没有什么合理的理由支撑这种优越感。

你知道，如果我们从和他们一样的起点出发，拥有和他们一样的父母、一样的环境，你真的有把握一定会比他们好很多吗？我不确定。但我们自然而然——完全下意识地——当我们在经济上比别人高一些时，我们就觉得整个人“高”过别人。

这种反应太直接、太迅速了。因为我们许多人会把钱抓在手里，说：“这就是我的重要感来源，这让我觉得自己有价值。”

但另一方面，有些人却不一样。有些人把钱当作“安全感”。

你看，有的人用钱来获得别人的认可，有的人用钱来获得掌控感。有的人用钱来说：“我觉得自己重要。”而另一些人则说：“我需要钱，因为那样我才安全。”

别忘了我在这里问的问题：如果你并没有“让人瞠目结舌”般地慷慨地给出去，如果你发现金钱极难从你手里离开，如果你并没有慷慨到让这个世界看到基督徒就感到惊讶——而多数人并没有——为什么？为什么金钱会有这样的能力捆住我们？

其中一个答案是：因为钱是你的“重要感”；另一个可能性是：钱是你的“安全感”。

换句话说，你觉得：只要我有钱，在这个不可控的世界里，我就可以掌控。我可以掌控我的生活，我可以掌控局面。如果发生了什么，我有钱在手，我就“安全了”。

而耶稣基督却说，追逐这些东西，不能为你的生命多加一刻，连一分钟都加不了。他在这里说：“你们哪一个能用思虑使寿数多加一刻呢？”掌管这些事情的，是上帝。掌管你生命长短、命运际遇的，是上帝。钱不会把你变成上帝。钱根本不可能让你真正拥有哪怕一丁点的终极掌控力。

我的一位老师，阿迪森·里奇（Addison Leitch），是伊丽莎白·艾略特（Elizabeth Elliot）的第二任丈夫——她前两个丈夫都先后去世，她现在已经第三次结婚。她的第二任丈夫，就是我的老师。我曾听他讲过一个故事。

他说，有一次他在思想“金钱可以成为我们的安全感”这一点。他在大学任教的时期，有两个女学生在大学里信了主。

她们回家之后，对父母说：我们信了主，成了基督徒，我们想做宣教士。

父母则说：“哦，不要做宣教士。”她们说：“听着，我们确实有了一次宗教经历，这很好。”父母说：“很好很好，你们经历了宗教上的改变，真是太好了。但你们还需要一点‘安全感’。在你们出去做宣教体验之前——如果你们真想去，去是可以的——但在那之前，我们希望你们先拿个硕士学位，我们希望你们先找一两份工作，这样才有工作履历，才能算真正把事业起步。我们也希望你们在银行里存一点钱，以备不时之需，这样才有安全感。”

后来，这两个女孩子又去找我的老师里奇博士，问他说：“那我们该怎么回应父母呢？”

里奇博士说：“哦，我会这样对我的父母说：‘亲爱的爸爸妈妈，我们现在就生活在一块在太空中旋转的小石头上，这块小石头叫“地球”。谁知道我们会不会哪一天撞上什么东西？但就算我们一辈子都不撞到什么东西，总有一天，在我们每个人脚底下都会打开一扇地板门，每个人都会掉下去。

在你生命的最后，一扇地板门会在你脚下打开，你会从这块小石头上掉下去。那时候，在你下面，要么是永恒的双臂，要么什么都没有。而你觉得，一张硕士学位就能给你“安全感”？我们来看看吧。’”

这正是耶稣在这里要说的。他说，金钱的力量在于：它看起来好像能给你“重要感”；但当你真的把它当成你的“重要感”来源时，你就会变成一个骄傲的人，没人喜欢你。而你以为钱可以给你安全感，但事实上，钱根本不可能拦住那些真正重要的事情——它拦不住死亡，拦不住悲剧，拦不住关系破裂，拦不住任何事情。

那么我们怎么打破金钱在我们生命中的权势呢？答案是这样的：我们怎样才能来到一个地步，真的在金钱上“激进地慷慨”？我们怎样才能来到一个地步，不再为钱忧虑？我们怎样才能来到一个地步，使得金钱不再以各种方式挟制我们？

来看 19 节：

“不要为自己积攒财宝在地上，地上有虫子咬，能锈坏，也有贼挖窟窿来偷；只要积攒财宝在天上，天上没有虫子咬，不能锈坏，也没有贼挖窟窿来偷。”

从原文来看，耶稣是在说：“不要把你的心‘珍藏’在地上的财宝上，而要把你的心‘珍藏’在天上的财宝上。”他在说的是“珍宝”——不要把地上的东西当“珍宝”，要把天上的东西当“珍宝”。

这点很重要，因为在每个人灵魂的深处，都有一样他珍视的东西。

“珍视”某件东西是什么意思？意思就是你凝视它、思想它，将它的美与价值装进你的心里，并且对它说：“只要我有这个，一切都值得。”

如果我得到了这个，一切都值得；如果我有这个，我就值得。

换句话说，每个人都有某样东西。那可能是金钱，可能是事业，可能是地位，可能是爱情，可能是家庭——你紧紧盯着它，把它当作你的“珍宝”，你对自己说：“只要我能拥有这个，其他的一切就都值得。”

在座每一个人心里都有某样东西——在地上你正在对它这样说：“如果我有这个，一切都值得；如果我有这个，我就值得。”

我最喜欢的一本科幻／奇幻小说《魔戒》（The Lord of the Rings）里，就讲到一个特别的“戒指”。它极其美丽，谁拿到了这枚戒指，谁就受它的影响。你看着它，每一个拥有它的人都会称它为“我的宝贝”（my precious），称它为“宝贝”。

耶稣在这里说的是：在每一个人灵魂深处，都有这么一个“宝贝”。有一样东西，你曾经凝视它，对它说：“这对我来说太宝贵了。如果我有它，一切都值得；如果我有它，我就值得。”

你心里已经有某样这样的东西了。但无论那是什么，你都会被它奴役。只要你的灵魂把某样东西当作“珍宝”，你就会愿意为它付出任何代价，你什么都愿意做，好得到它，因为在你眼中，它是唯一“值得一切”的东西。

你看到了吗？

圣经说，除了耶稣以外，所有你当作“宝贝”的东西，都会要求你为它“舍命”——要你为它死。但耶稣自己是那位唯一的“宝贝”，他却为买赎你而死。你若把别的任何东西当作你的至高价值，它都会对你说：“为我而死。”

但如果你把耶稣基督当作你的至高价值，他却对你说：“我已经为你而死。”

那么你怎样才能让耶稣基督成为你的“珍宝”呢？答案只有一个：你必须真把他当作你的珍宝；你必须真把他当作“天上的财宝”；你必须真心珍视他。唯有如此，你才会在某种意义上从金钱里得释放。

我一会儿会解释那是什么意思。但首先，我们要问：你如何才能珍视耶稣？

想想他对自己“珍宝”所做的一切。他原本拥有终极的珍宝——他是主，他拥有至高无上的地位与身份；他也拥有终极的安全感——他是子，与父同在。

但当他来到世上，在十字架上发生了什么？他被剥夺得一无所有。他被赤身露体地钉在十字架上，所有属他的财物和拥有都被剥光；那只是一个外在的、可见的反映——实际上，他在属灵上也被剥夺一空。他失去了一切的“珍宝”。

为什么？因为他在为某样东西而死。你只会为你认为“最宝贵”的东西而死。

这意味着什么？意味着耶稣基督一定曾看着我们，对我们说：“只要我能得到他们，就算我下到地狱也值得。”

《以赛亚书》第 53 章的预言说：当他看见自己受苦的果效，就心满意足。你们知道，在《彼得前书》2 章 9 节说：“惟有你们是被拣选的族类，是有君尊的祭司，是圣洁的国度，是属神的子民。”原文也可以翻为“是神用重价买来的产业”，意思就是：你们是他的“珍宝”。

除非你知道，他甘愿失去自己一切的珍宝，好让你可以成为他的珍宝；除非你意识到，他看着你，心里是那样说：“如果我能拥有他们，再大的代价都值得。没有什么值得为了不救他们而保留；为了救他们，再大的代价都可以付。”

除非你明白他这样宝贝你、这样爱你，否则你不会真正被释放——只有这件事，才能把你从金钱中真正释放出来。它会彻底释放你，不仅仅是从金钱中释放，也会从一切其他假神中释放你。

那我说“从金钱中释放”是什么意思呢？这里有一个简单的测试：你如何看待“有钱人”？

我可以告诉你，我们大多数人的反应。你们当中很多人其实是 resent 有钱人的，你们心里轻视他们，会说：“看看他们的钱，看看他们的房子，看看他们那些东西。”然后你就觉得自己比他们高一等——这就说明金钱仍然在你身上有权势。这说明你在属灵上并不富足，也暴露出你内心的谦卑还不够，福音还没有真正成为你生命的中心。

如果你厌恶有钱人，如果你觉得自己在他们之上，那就说明钱仍然在你身上有权势。这表明你在属灵上并不富足，也暴露出你内心的谦卑还不足，福音还没有真正成为你生命的中心——你并没有真正用福音来定义自己。

然而，如果你羡慕有钱人，如果你一走进某个人的房子、某个公寓，就忍不住在心里说：“哇，他竟然让我进到这个地方来，太棒了，这也太好了吧！”——如果你是这样的反应，那同样说明钱在你身上有权势。

福音的信息是：你比自己所敢承认的更有罪，但也比自己所敢盼望的更被爱。前一部分——“更有罪”——会防止你在有钱人面前产生优越感；后一部分——“更被爱”——会防止你在有钱人面前产生自卑感。

因此，福音把你带到一个地方，使你真的“不再在乎钱”了。一个最明显的标记，就是你可以真心去爱有钱人。

第二个标记，说明钱已经不再有权势在你身上，是你也能真心尊重穷人。你看着他们，尊重他们，指望从他们身上学东西，不再用眼角瞟他们、从高处看他们。

而这点，老实说，非常非常难。通常来说，我们身上都有一个倾向，说明钱仍然有力量辖制我们：很多时候，一旦我们周围出现穷人，我们就开始用鼻孔看人。

你知道，这是纽约——还好是在纽约。在纽约，你真的会和穷人一起坐地铁，你真的会看到穷人。你知道，在其他很多地方，我们把穷人隔开、赶走、划区——让他们去别的地方。但在纽约，你不能把人“划走”，这是件好事，谢谢纽约。在某种意义上，纽约更像“新耶路撒冷”。很多人会讨厌“新耶路撒冷”，因为他们讨厌纽约——那里不会再有任何“分区隔离”。

而其中一个好处就是：你会常常与穷人同在。问题是：你怎么回应他们呢？

如果因着耶稣的福音，因着你知道他失去自己的一切珍宝，只为使你成为他的珍宝；如果这一切真的让你谦卑、融化你、提升你，那么你就会发现，你越来越容易去爱富人，同时也越来越容易去爱穷人。

第三个标志，说明钱不再在你生命中掌权，就是：你会变得非常慷慨。

有一处经文很有意思——22 节：“眼睛就是身上的灯。你的眼睛若了亮（good）……”原文这个词在希腊文里有双重含义，不仅可以指“好的”，也可以指“慷慨的”。

一个真正因着把耶稣当作“珍宝”而从金钱中得释放的基督徒，会有一只“慷慨的眼睛”。你总是在看、总是在留意机会。你看你的朋友、邻舍、你的教会、穷人、你的城市——你总是在寻找可以给出去的机会。

这时你会问：“那我应该给多少呢？”——这是我最后要谈的。

要回答这个问题，你必须看耶稣是怎么做的。当耶稣把你当作“珍宝”时，他是以牺牲的方式爱你的。如果你要回应耶稣，意味着什么？意味着你不仅要在关系上活出基督十字架的样式，也要在经济上活出十字架的样式。

听好这点。几乎每一个基督徒都会说：“哦，我是基督徒，因此耶稣为我而死，他过的是一条牺牲的生命。因此，我也要像基督爱我那样去爱别人。”——很好。

但这意味着什么？意味着你每年必须给出去足够多的钱，以至于它确实“牺牲”了你的生活方式。如果你在奉献，但并没有真实改变你的生活方式，那就说明没有“十字架”介入到你的经济生活中。如果你没有给出去足够多，以致于它在实际生活中产生影响、改变你的生活方式，那你就还没有在金钱层面上真正回应耶稣为你所做的。

对我们大多数人来说——我是在说“多数人、在多数地方、在多数时代”——十一奉献（10%）是一个目标。为什么？因为在大多数地方、大多数时代、对大多数人而言，圣经说“把十分之一给出去”，是一个不错的参考数字，是一个很好的起点，让我们思考我们的奉献。

这是一个判断“福音是否在你心里发挥作用”的好方式。因为如果福音真在你心里动工，你真的看见耶稣基督为你所做的，10% 根本算不得什么。毕竟，如果耶稣只是“把他的血十一奉献”——只流出 10% 的血，你仍然是灭亡的。耶稣远远超越了“十一奉献”。因此，10% 看起来真不算多。

然而，对大多数人来说，10% 确实意味着“牺牲”。对我们大多数人而言，在 10% 上，会有一个“十字架”——那会很难、会很疼。

但在当今的美国，越来越多的人，给出 10% 根本不会带来任何改变，连一点点痛都感受不到。你看，重点不在“10%”这个数字上，圣经并没有说你“恰好必须”给多少。10% 只是一个经验法则，是一个帮助你起步的好方式。

标准其实是“十字架”。10% 对多数人来说只是个例子；真正的标准，是十字架本身。

在你的生命中——在你的经济生活中——有没有“十字架”的记号？

如果耶稣是你的珍宝，你会爱富人；如果耶稣是你的珍宝，你会爱穷人；如果耶稣是你的珍宝，你会在金钱上欢喜地、刻意地、乐意地给出去。

这正是早期教会之所以有强大影响力的原因。我们有一封很古老的书信《致戴格尼图书信》（Letter to Diognetus），其中提到早期基督徒，说到他们为什么如此受欢迎、为什么让人震惊。信里说：“他们与所有人共享餐桌，却不与所有人共享床榻。”

换句话说，那时的外邦人对自己的身体非常放纵，却对钱极其吝啬；而基督徒对自己的身体极其谨慎，却在金钱上极其“放纵”——他们似乎“到处乱给钱”。

想一想，哪一种人更祝福自己的邻里社区？

换句话说，我想我上周也说过：你愿意住在怎样的社区里？你愿意住在一群人当中，这些人对钱极其吝啬，却对自己的身体极其放纵？那会给社区带来什么影响？如果你是一名孩子，你想住在那样的社区吗？

还是你想住在这样的社区——那里的人在性方面有操守，在金钱上却极其慷慨？

一个城市，若充满了这样的人，就会是一个健康的城市；一个社区若充满这样的人，就会是一个健康的社区。《登山宝训》在公共领域有着巨大的影响意义。让我们活出来吧。

我们一起来祷告——

天父，我们感谢你，赐给我们这段时间来思想“在天上积攒财宝”意味着什么。我们为你儿子为我们所做的一切感谢你，为你所成就的一切感谢你。

我们祈求你，让这些真理在我们生命中真实、具体地发生，使金钱不再在我们身上有权势——不再让我们因有钱人而感到害怕、不再让我们在有钱人面前自卑，或在有钱人面前愤怒，或在有钱人面前自高自大。主啊，求你改变我们，使我们成为一种截然不同的人，一种独特的群体。

你在历史上已经这样做过——早期教会真正明白这些。愿这也在我们身上成真。奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。

那些在性上有节制，却在金钱上极其慷慨的人？

一个充满这种人的城市，会是健康的城市；一个充满这种人的社区，会是健康的社区。《登山宝训》在公共生活层面有着极大的影响潜力——如果我们真的活出来。

让我们活出来吧。

我们一起来祷告——

天父，我们感谢你，赐给我们这段时间来思想“在天上积攒财宝”意味着什么。我们为你儿子为我们所做的一切感谢你，为你在他里头赐给我们的一切感谢你。

我们祈求你，让这些真理在我们生命中成为真实，使金钱不再在我们身上掌权——不再让我们在有钱人面前胆怯、不再让我们在他们面前自卑，或在他们面前发怒，或在他们面前自高自大。

主啊，求你改变我们，使我们成为一种截然不同的人，一群独特的子民。你过去已经这样做过——早期教会真正明白这一切。愿这也在我们身上成真。

奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。
