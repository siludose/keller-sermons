today's podcast, Tim Keller looks at how Ecclesiastes helps  us face our doubts, fears and uncertainties and points us to the lasting hope and significance  we have in Christ. Let's take a look at this passage. Now, we're about to read from Ecclesiastes and last  year, last fall, I did one sermon on Ecclesiastes and ever since then I wanted to come back. And in  the month of September, we're going to be looking at some of the basic themes of this book. And right away, as we read it, you're going to see it's different.

It's so different than  other books of the Bible, it'll strike you right away. Ecclesiastes chapter 9, we're  going to read verses 2 to 16. All share a common destiny, the righteous and the wicked,  the good and the bad, the clean and the unclean, those who offer sacrifices and those who  do not, as it is with a good man, so with a sinner, as it is with those who take oaths,  so with those who are afraid to take them. This is the evil and everything that happens  under the sun. The same destiny overtakes all.

The hearts of men more over a full of evil  and there is madness in their hearts while they live, and afterwards, they join the dead. Anyone who is among the living has hope. Even a live dog is better than a dead lion. For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing, they have no further  reward, and even the memory of them is forgotten. Their love, their hate and their jealousy  have long since vanished, never again will they have a part in anything that happens  under the sun.

Go, eat your food with gladness, drink your wine with the joyful heart for  it is now that God favors what you do. Always be clothed in white, always anoint your  head with oil, enjoy life with your wife, whom you love all the days of this meaningless  life that God has given you under the sun. All your meaningless days. For this is your  lot in life, and in your toil some labor under the sun. Whatever your hand finds to do,  do it with all your might.

For in the grave, where you are going, there is neither working,  nor planning, nor knowing, nor wisdom. I have seen something else under the sun. The  race is not to the swift, or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise,  or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned, but time and chance happens to them  all. Moreover, no one knows when this hour will come. As Fischer caught in the cruel  matter, birds are taken in a snare, so men are trapped by evil times that fall unexpectedly  upon them.

But I also saw, under the sun, an example of wisdom that greatly impressed  me. There was once a small city with only a few people in it, and a powerful king came  against it and surrounded it and built huge seed works against it. Now, they lived in  that city, a man poor, but wise, and he saved the city by his wisdom. But nobody remembered  that poor man. So I said, wisdom is better than strength, but the poor man's wisdom is despised  and his words are no longer heated.

This is God's word. This is God's word. There's never  been a time where in the last few decades, at least in America, maybe even the West, where  people have been searching more, doing more spiritual searching. And there's no better place  to go do spiritual searching than going to the book of Ecclesiastes. The word Ecclesiastes  is the Latin translation for the Hebrew word for the author.

And the Hebrew word, what the author  calls himself, is cohaleth, which actually means, it's very hard, a public teacher or a commentator. Some people have actually called him a pundit, a public teacher, a commentator, a person who's  commenting on the way things are. Now, there's no better place to go. If you or you know somebody,  no better place to go, if you're on a spiritual search, if you're trying to find faith or trying  to find God or trying to find what's out there, there's no better place than the book of Ecclesiastes  because in the entire Bible, this is the only book written from the viewpoint of esceptic. Written from the viewpoint of someone who doesn't believe, written from the viewpoint of someone  who's a practical secularist.

Let me take a second to explain that. For example, unless you  understand that, that this is the only book like that, it's going to be very confusing to read. Look at verse five, for example. It says, the dead, no, nothing. Is that what the Bible teaches?

Is that the overall whole, is that what the Bible teaches about  the afterlife? No, well, what's it doing here? Because the key phrase, which comes up several times  in this text, and it comes up dozens of times in the book of Ecclesiastes, it comes up nowhere else  in any book of the Bible. In fact, it comes over nowhere else in any part of literature. Is the term, under the sun.

And what this means is, he does not say,  this is true, this is true, this is true, this is a fact, this is a fact. He says, this is a fact  under the sun, this is true, under the sun, under the sun. This life is meaningless. What? Not just life is meaningless.

This life is meaningless under the sun. What does that mean? It means this life, understood without any reference to life above the sun,  or beyond the sun. In other words, this life without reference to there being an eternity  or heaven, this life, if this life is all there is, that's what life under the sun means. And what's so helpful about this guy, is the point of view he takes, is not a philosophical  atheism, but it's very much, frankly, it's very much the practical secularism of the average  New Yorker and increasingly the average Western person.

When I say practical secularism, notice he  uses the word God a couple times. He talks about the meaningless life that God has given us, but you  see, in the book of Ecclesiastes, God is not the biblical God. The judge of heaven and earth,  the lover of our souls. If you ask the average New Yorker, do you believe in God? There's  very few atheists.

There's very few rigorous philosophical doctrinaire atheists who say there  can't be a God. The average person says, yes, there's probably some kind of supreme being,  but we can't know what that God thinks, or we can't know that God, we can't know the will of God. And therefore, essentially, this life is all there is. We don't know why we're here. And after you're dead, that's it.

And therefore, you've got to kind of make the best of it. That's practical secularism. And the book of Ecclesiastes gets into that position  and says, okay, you're practical secularists. How does life really look? And then he goes after  in the book, and we're going to take these next three weeks on these three.

He says, let's take a  look at the three basic projects that all human beings have got to do. If you're going to live  the basic projects, so you can't avoid. And even if you don't think you're doing them, you have to  do them because you can't live without avoiding them. And the three basic projects are  justice, pleasure, and achievement. Achievement is, what is worth doing in my life?

What am I  going to spend my life doing? You know, what should I be doing? Pleasure is, where will I find  happiness? What will satisfy me really? And thirdly, how do I deal with the injustice and the  evil and suffering I see in the world?

You can't live without asking those questions or essentially  answering them, even if you don't think you're answering them, you are answering them. And he says,  all right, let's just say, here's the reason that the book of Ecclesiastes is so unusual and it's  so helpful. And why a book eventually brings you to God, because the book of Ecclesiastes is not  just doubt, belief. The great thing about the book, and it's so democratic when you think about it,  the Ecclesiastes are also doubts on belief. Now this is something that almost nobody does.

Now  as people know, yeah, well, yes, let's doubt belief, but let's not doubt it. You say, it wouldn't be  fair would it to only doubt belief, only doubt faith. Surely if you're going to doubt faith and ask  very hard questions about faith, wouldn't you doubt your doubts? Shouldn't you doubt your doubts? Shouldn't you ask hard questions about unbelief?

You say, you're standing someplace even when you doubt. You can't doubt without standing someplace. And a practical secularism secularism says,  this life is all there is. Okay, says the writer. Let's ask a few questions about that position.

And the first one is, how do you deal with justice, the injustice of life? Now, when he does this,  some of you today, this is the main spiritual issue you've got. This is the main problem. This is the main problem with God, with faith, with everything, because you have seen or you've  experienced this kind of suffering. For some of the rest of you, it's not maybe the main problem.

That's what we're going to do some other weeks, but it's still very important. How do you deal  with injustice? Now here's what this guy does, and I'm going to only be able to outline  three things he does. First of all, he refuses to let you avoid the question of injustice,  and then secondly, he gives us two answers, clues to two answers. First of all, he refuses to let  us avoid the question.

He puts the question in front of us. He refuses to let us tune it out,  and then secondly, and then he gives us the clues for two answers, two answers for how to deal with  injustice. First of all, let me show you, look how he makes sure you do not avoid the question. This is very easy to tune out. In verse 11 and 12, first of all, he's tear talking about the  random general injustice in life, and he says, what?

He says, the race is not to the swift,  nor the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise, nor wealth to the brilliant,  or favorite of the learned, but time and chance happens to all. And moreover, as Fischer caught in  a cruel net, birds would take it in a snare, men are trapped by evil times that fall unexpectedly  upon them. One writer I was reading for a pairing for this, one night just took down the first  couple sentences of every news story on this TV news, and here's what he got. There was trouble  in Middle East again tonight. Today, three terrorists come and dear to school bus and set off  explosives that killed both themselves and all the children.

A major storm hit Bangladesh,  thousands were drowned, tens of thousands are homeless. Four car pile up on 261 resulted in five deaths. In the Bronx, a five-year-old girl in her mother's lap was killed by a stray bullet. And here was one that's a little more of a research thing. Thousands of two-thirds world children  die daily from largely preventable diseases out of complacency and selfishness and  invincible ignorance that people with the power to treat them simply fail to do so.

Now, what is that saying? It's what the Ecclesiastes writer is trying to say. It doesn't matter who you are, where you are, it doesn't matter whether you're good or bad. Horrible things happen constantly, random without just, it's crazy. It can happen anybody.

Suddenly beautiful little children blown up. Suddenly this, suddenly that,  it's like, and as he says, it can happen anybody. It can happen anytime. You can't avoid it and  you never know when it's going to happen. The random misery and cruelty of the world,  the injustice of life, that's the first thing he brings up.

He says, look at that. The race is not  to the swift, you see. You may be swift, but you may lose. You may be brilliant, but you may  may not succeed because, frankly, life is a crap shoot. You think you're under control.

If you  think you're under control, you think if I just do this and do this and this, things are going to go  well for me. You're very, very young. I mean, I say interesting. I do that way. Every two months,  I say that somehow and everybody laughs because you are young, or maybe it's only the old people left.

I better watch careful next time. You are not in control. One of the ways that young people  tune out the injustice of life is they say, it's those people. It's not going to happen to me. I'm  going to watch my back.

I'm going to be very careful. I'm going to discipline myself. I'm not  going to ride on school buses in the Middle East. I'm going to have all sorts of things. But he won't stop there.

He goes on. Now, when he goes on, I want you to know right away,  some of you are going to start to defend yourself against what he says here,  because you're going to say he's just being gloomy. I'll get back to that. He says, oh yeah,  there's people like this. Here's what he does.

He goes on. He goes on past the random general  injustice that happens to so many people, and he moves to the absolute ultimate injustice that  happens to everybody. That, in verse 3 and 4, as it is with a good man, so with a sinner,  as it is with those who take oath, so with those who are afraid to take them. This is the evil in  everything that happens under the sun. I looked down at verse 5, for the living know that they will  die, but the dead know nothing.

They have no further reward, and even the memory of them is  forgotten. Their love and their hate, their jealousy, have long since vanished. Never will they  have a part in anything that happens under the sun. Here's what he's saying. He is not just saying  here.

They good people have it bad and bad people have it good. That's injustice, and that often  happens. That's sort of random thing. He's saying something else. Something deeper.

He says,  no matter what you do in life, whether you live a life of look, a life of love, verse 6, or hate,  whether you are the terrorist or the child. Everything you do will vanish, but worse than that,  even the memory of what you do, even the effect of what you do will be forgotten. At the end of the road for every human being, if this life is all there is, there is a nothingness  that if you're willing to think about it at all, and I'm making you, he says,  makes everything you do meaningless, everything you do. Kathy and I recently watched on video one of the latest John Sales movie called Men with Guns,  Powerful Movie. In the movie, it's about a doctor in a Latin American country who has trained  a bunch of young doctors, and they have gone up into the hinterland, they've gone up into the  parts of the country.

They're very remote and very poor, and those doctors were going to give  health care to people who desperately needed it. And when he came to understand that virtually every  single one of the people that he had trained and sat out there had been killed either by the army  or by the gorillas almost immediately, so that everything he'd done and all that they'd put their  lies into was gone. He goes, the whole movie is basically about him going into one incredibly  dangerous place after another to just find every one of those young people, and he never can find them,  and the very end he dies, his last words are, a man should have a legacy. And at one point in the movie, he says, I'm not a religious man,  I'm not a religious man, I'm a scientist, I'm a doctor, but I want to know that I've done  something to make this place better. I've got to know that, or my life is absolutely meaningless.

Well, the ecclesiastes writer says, wake up! What if they didn't die yet? Listen, if you build the pyramids, you'll be remembered for a while longer than the rest of us. But eventually, if when you die, you rot, and when the sun dies, everything rots,  cosmic forgottenness lies at the end of every person's life, it doesn't matter what you've  done, it doesn't matter who you are, the same destiny, and that makes everything you do pointless,  everything. Now somebody's saying, I know what you're saying, he's saying, oh, I've heard this  I had to take philosophy 101, I've heard this sort of thing, this person just being gloomy,  I want you to know, you say, that even if you think about that, if you're a practical secularist,  you say, of course, if you think about that, you're going to be depressed all the time, but hey,  there's Central Park, there's the theater, there's sex, there's incredible restaurants,  there's wonderful clothes, and you know what, he's heard this from you, and in verse 7, look, he goes  right on, he's heard this, he's heard it a hundred times, he heard people say, oh yeah, sure,  it's meaningless if you're going to think philosophically, but let's just, let's go out there and really  be normal people, and he goes on, he says, okay, sure, fine.

So, verse 7, go eat your food with  gladness, now I don't want to get into my next two sermons here, go eat your food with gladness,  drink your wine with a joyful heart, be clothed with white, good food, parties, look great,  feel marvelous, okay, see, enjoy life with your wife, have sex all the days of this meaningless life,  he says, listen, it's meaningless anyway, it's going to keep breaking through, it doesn't matter,  you see, he's really saying, don't you dare tune this out, all the great ones are like this,  Buddha, Sidhartha, before his became Buddha, before he became the old story that he was raised  in a palace and he hadn't really seen suffering, when he finally went out, the first day he saw an  old man, and the second day he saw a sick man, and the third day he saw a dead man,  and he realized this was coming to everybody, and the way the legend goes, at one point, he turns  to his charioteer, he turns to his servant, and he says, the hearts of men must be hard to be self  composed before such a situation, he starts to cry out, he says, old age, well the charioteer says,  well of course old age, I mean everybody knows, you lose all your beauty eventually, you lose all  your memory, you lose all your sensation, you lose even, everybody knows this, but see Buddha says,  you know this and you're not crying out, you're not wrestling with you, doesn't this make everything  meaningless, we have to do something, we have to come to grips with it, see the great ones always  say that, the great ones refuse to tune it out, what do you do with the evening news, I know what I  tend to do, another bomb, you know it's on, another bomb, a flood, okay kids, dinner's on the table, turn  off the news, you tune it out, please ask this writer says, don't you dare, you want to lose what  little humanity you have left, now he refuses to have you, let you out from under the question,  the question of injustices, injustice in this world, and especially the ultimate injustice of radical  and cosmic nothingness and forgottenness, makes every single thing meaningless, everything pointless,  everything vanity, but in this text we also have, and we're going to be looking at this more in the  next three weeks, in this text we also have the clues to two, the two biblical answers, to this question  of injustice, now what I mean by that is, the Bible says don't tune out injustice but don't go into  despair, there's a third way, don't tune out injustice but don't go into despair, there's a third way,  you may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger brother,  in fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who try to  earn his love by being good, in his book the prodigal god Tim Keller shows how this well-known story  reveals the heart of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother  and the judgmental older brother, and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal  extravagant grace, whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith, the prodigal god will  help you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way, the prodigal god is our thank you for  your gift this month to help gospel and life share the hope and joy of Christ's gracious and  relentless love with people all over the world.

Over the years it seems like increasingly I've found that the  Bible's answer boils down to two and I'm going to call them a cool answer and a hot answer. One is an answer for the mind, that's the cool one and one is an answer for the heart, that's the  hot one, all by themselves they don't work but together they're remarkable and the Ecclesiastes  writer because he's Ecclesiastes because he's different than any other book in the Bible does not  tell you but clue you.

He does not let see the Ecclesiastes is not a lecture, it's a seminar. It's almost a bull session. He does, he goes you, he role plays, he pushes you with questions, he  gives you clues and here the clues to both the cool and the hot answer. I will be brief but here's  what I want to tell you, even though I'm going to be brief, when we go through the cool answer right  now I want you to be patient. If you are not suffering the cool answer is very interesting but if  you're suffering the cool answer is very inadequate.

Okay but you have to have them both. What's the  cool answer? Alright, the cool or the answer, actually it's not called cool, let's call it the  answer for the mind. He gets at that in verses three and four, in verse four he says something  terrible about dogs and my wife is a dog lover and I promised her that I would not, I would put  this into context, but in verse four he says it's better to be a live dog than a dead lion. Now when  you think of dogs you think of beagles and collies but when the ancient people thought of dogs they  did not because the ancient people, dogs were the lowest form of animal, dogs were the scavengers,  dogs were wild, dogs lived on garbage and dogs ate cadavers, I mean when Jezebel the great queen,  the evil queen Jezebel is thrown into the street back in the Old Testament, what happens?

The dogs come into her, you see because well because of course she deserves the dogs they say because  she is so evil and the dogs deserve her you see because they're so they're so low but the lion  out of the ancients the lion was the greatest noble beast just as we see him now and now listen  what is he saying in verse four astounding. In fact if it wasn't linked with verse five we would have  to back away what he says in verse four is fairly simple he says there it's better to be a  liar a murderer a scavenger and save your skin than be a noble person who dies it's not worth it  to live for anything anymore what he's really saying you say what is he saying yes he's saying  something so shocking and so vicious he says it no longer matters it's better to save your skin be  a liar and a murderer and a thief then it is to be a noble person and die for it and if you say he  is he saying that it's in verse five the word four you see the word four this is the reason four  and go down in there and he says because love or hate in the end they vanish and what he's saying  is something very very very up to date and the philosophers are saying it now and what is it what  they are saying is this if this life is all there is if when you die you're rot if we're just we  just accidentally evolved as the out of the collocation of accidental forces then there is no such  thing as they're right and wrong there can't be all moral distinctions are pointless why well  Alistair McIntyre great philosopher has done this very very well in a couple of his books he says  here's the reason why he says the there's no such thing as abstract goodness goodness is always  relative to purpose what if you somebody gave you a watch and you'd never seen a watch before in  your life this is McIntyre's illustration but somebody gave you a watch and you'd never seen  this watch watch before and somebody says is it good you'd say I don't know what is it for  there's no such thing as abstract goodness is it is the watch for hammering a nail it's bad  is the watch for you know you know what is the watch for until you know what something is for you  don't know what is good or bad things are only good or bad in relation to the purpose what makes a  good human being McIntyre says if we're accidents if there's no purpose then it's  ridiculous to say it's bad to hurt people you're just here to survive the strong eat the  weak you're just here to survive better to be a live dog better to trample on people I mean  what how dare you say who who are you to say there's no warrant to say that anything is good or bad  if this life as all there is there is no good or bad but now here's the other part of this weird  argument in verse three in spite of the fact that he says vanity meaningless it's all meaningless  it's all meaningless up in verse three he says but men are evil and this is the problem  Derek Kiddner one of my favorite commentators on this verse Derek Kiddner says something  extremely interesting he says what we may not notice about verse three at first is that this  sense of outrage is just as much a fact about us as is our mortality the fascination of this  book of Ecclesiastes throughout its length arises largely from the collisions of observation and  equally obstinate and opposed intuitions so it pushes us toward a synthesis that is largely  beyond its own pages is what he means if you don't believe if you believe this life is all there is  then there's no such thing as injustice right and yet deep inside you know there is  on the one hand he says vanity meaningless pointless but then he also says and yet it's still as  evil and there is an incredible contradiction in the heart of being a secular person at the heart  of unbelief says this I don't believe really in a God because of the injustice but if there is no  God there's no basis for being outraged put it I'll go put it to you two ways it'll be on tape so  you can always listen to it again if there's a God evil is a problem it's a big problem he's got  reasons for why he's allowing it and we don't know what they are but that's not that really hurts  it still doesn't really make it better if there's a God evil is a problem but if even if evil is a  problem for you there must be a God you see that if evil is a problem if you are outraged and yet  your own worldview gives you no basis for the outrage what it means is your worldview is wrong  if you know there's an injustice even though if there is no God there shouldn't be an injustice then  you know there's a God put it another way it's a problem for belief evil is a problem for belief but  it's a bigger problem for unbelief it's what it's a problem if you believe in God but it's a  bigger problem if you don't believe in God because if you don't believe in God then the main  the original reason for disbelieving in God is gone you can't even define injustice there's no basis  for it that's the cool argument it's a very strong argument it's being made by Christian  philosophers all the time and that is evil is a problem for belief but it's a bigger problem for  unbelief and that's your only two alternatives so why not believe you have no basis for outrage no  basis for against injustice unless there is a just judge we don't know why he's not acting but if  you get rid of him out of your mental furniture you got a bigger problem than if you keep him now  didn't I warn you if you're not suffering if you're kind of intellectual type and there's lots of  you out there like that I know that's intriguing that's interesting you never thought of that that's  helpful maybe even but if you're suffering right now it's just cold it's cold comfort there's a  place in C. S. Lewis's book a grief observed where he says the thing I'm afraid of and when his  wife died Joy Davidman Gresham who went to Hunter College by the way when his wife died he says  the thing I'm not so much afraid of is that there is no God I'm afraid of who he might be  I'm afraid of meeting a God that I don't like Christianity doesn't just give you one  one answer the one answer is there we just gave it to you lots of religions have it there is a  God if there is no God you have a bigger problem with evil than if you don't have a God but Christianity  gives you another one it's the hot answer it's the personal answer it's the answer for the heart  and what is it well the clues for you're in this last little vignette what a weird story  when he says I saw one more thing and it impressed me in Hebrew that's that's a two-week  a word the word impress means it amazed me it confounded me it mystified me I don't know what it  means and here's why he saw a kind of wisdom in this little story this little thing he saw I saw  kind of wisdom beyond any wisdom he knew there was once a small city with only a few people in it  and a powerful king came against it surrounded it and built huge seed works against it  and now they lived in that city a man poor but wise he saved the city by his wisdom but nobody  remembered that poor man but the poor man's wisdom was despised there's three things about this  wisdom he'd never seen before first of all it was a saving wisdom look at a little city few people  versus a great king huge seed works it was absolutely overwhelming the city was absolutely doomed  there was no way out we don't know exactly how he did it but there was a wisdom that was so  incredibly powerful that it was able to save that city that's incredible but that's not all  more than that secondly it wasn't just a saving wisdom it was a serving wisdom one of the things  that is so weird and so unusual about this at least in the Old Testament is the wise man is poor  now you know the Ecclesiastes is a wise man and if you read the whole book you'll see he's a king  you'll see that he's rich because frankly if you're really wise if you're really smart  of course you're gonna get up in the world of course you're gonna make some money of course  you're gonna get ahead how could a wise man be poor but suddenly he's confronted with the fact  that this wisest of men this person with with with a most a supernatural saving wisdom  has not used his wisdom to dominate or get up but to be a servant he's used it in a humble way  and then lastly the most astounding thing of all anybody who has that kind of power and wisdom  and that kind of form of serving serving hood and wisdom he was not just forgotten look  he says nobody remembered him but he says he was despised it was a vicious it was a deliberate  forgetting the people turned on him they hated him now my friend Sinclair Ferguson wrote a book  on Ecclesiastes some years ago he called it pundits folly because he uses the term pundit  for the Ecclesiastes and this is what he says  he says God has pointed had placed testimonies to his presence throughout our lives there is no safe  haven there's no place we can escape his reality and the words of Ecclesiastes 9 13 to 16 read almost  like a prophecy whose name most naturally comes to mind when we hear of a poor man full of wisdom  who became a savior but whose life and teaching were rejected the man the pundit saw was just a  reflection of a wisdom beyond philosophical arguments wisdom himself the true poor wise man  who had become the savior as Paul describes him Christ crucified was a stumbling block to Jews  and foolishness to Greeks but to those whom Jesus who Christ is called both Jew and Greek  Christ the wisdom of God and the power of God now here's why this is the this is the hot answer  and this is a clue the Ecclesiastes writer sees a kind of wisdom and he's moved by it and we know why  because it's just an echo a pattern of the great wisdom and this is this we do not just have a  God who's simply up in heaven and he says I've got reasons why I'm not dealing with evil you're  just going to have to accept them they're and that and that's all you've got that's all you've got  you're in more shape if you reject me so there you are you're stuck with me tough  is that what God says not the Christian God the Christian God has done something unbelievable  here's the gospel we've forgotten God it is he who has made us but not and not we ourselves we've  forgotten him that means we go our own way we we doff our hats to him but in general every day  we don't remember him we forget him we act as if we're our own gods and because we have turned  away from the only permanent thing we have stopped because we've become temporary because we've  turned away from the only thing that lasts forever we are going to be forgotten and we know it  and deep in our hearts we know it that Ecclesiastes writer and Buddha and all the great ones are trying  to push you to say look at it you know the worst thing in the world is to be forgotten  to have people forget you to have people forget who you are that people forget that you were coming  I mean even in the micro that's horrible but in the macro it's even worse and here we're told  we deeply inside know that what's coming is cosmic forgottenness cosmic nothingness and we can't  handle it but God has done something about it he sent his son into the world and on the cross he  did not give us a philosophical argument when he was on the cross which is the why is the wisdom  of God when he was on the cross he did not say let me explain to you why if unbelief has more  of a problem with suffering than belief no what he said is my god my god why have you forgotten me  what was happening on the cross was God was pouring out the for the cosmic forgottenness he was  turning his back on his son he was giving to him what we deserve and what we know is coming in  what what is making our lives meaningless even though it's only half conscious even though it's  unconscious he got forsaken by his friends forsaken by his enemies but even forsaken by the father  he got the cosmic forgottenness that the ecclesiastist writer says is coming to everybody you know  it's coming to everybody and it's makes your life meaningless but it went into the heart of Jesus  that poor man was forgotten so that you will not be why do you think God can say and I say  49 can a woman forget the baby that nurses had her breasts yay she may forget but I will not  forget you behold you are engraved on the palm of my hands how can he say he'll never forget you  he'll never ever ever forget you that you will be remembered in love forever and ever  how can you walk out of the world knowing that that cosmic forgottenness is not yours anymore  and therefore you can walk out in the world and truly finally enjoy what's there because the  your forgottenness was put on Jesus and therefore the Christian can sing and though I am despised for  God yet God my God forgets me not and he is safe and must succeed for who Christ promises to plead  if you are not a believer today but you're a surcher I beg you you've got a hot and a cold answer  you not only have to think it out but you have to get to know this one this person a God who came  into suffering and received the suffering and injustice of this world in a more deep way than  anybody else has ever experienced it if you're a Christian let me tell you what your problem is  today you know what your problem is I'll tell you what it is you've forgotten the poor man  some of you are here today and you're upset you know what you've forgotten the one  who died for you though you forgot him bless the Lord of my soul says the Psalmist and all that is  within me bless his holy name bless the Lord of my soul and forget not his benefits the Psalmist  gets up every day and says my big problem is I've forgotten what he's done for me I've forgotten  the forgottenness that he took upon me if you're here today for example and you feel rejected by  somebody and you're in despair you've forgotten the fact that the only person whose opinion counts  the only one who's permanent the only one whose love will last forever loves you now because  your forgottenness was thrown on Jesus if you're a Christian today your whole problem is your  main problem is you've forgotten the poor man you've despised him you need to fill your heart  again with the knowledge of what he did for you don't you see this remember the poor man  and you'll live forever remember the poor man and you'll be loved forever let's pray we thank you  Lord God that because of who you made your son the son of God who loved you forever and knew  you forever and then what you did to him you poured out our forgottenness on him because of that  we can know that you will never forget us Lord when it comes down to it  philosophy can bring us to the brink can even give us some intellectual answers but it's only  a knowledge of your son that can help us to move out into the world and deal with the suffering  in a way that is neither tuning it out nor falling into despair oh we thank you that only at the cross  do we get to the place do we get the resources for dealing with the injustice of life  we pray Lord that those of us who are experiencing injustice now would know what your son  experienced for us that we can forgive and we can be strong and I pray for those here who don't  know who he is yet that through the despair that they might be feeling which is really a gift  of your Holy Spirit they may come to see who he is and what he's done for them I pray this in  Jesus name amen

### 引言：寻找意义

你是否曾问过自己，如果我所做的一切都不会长久，这就是全部吗？在今天的播客中，Tim Keller 探讨了传道书如何帮助我们面对疑惑、恐惧和不确定性，并指引我们在基督里找到持久的希望和意义。

让我们来看看这段经文。现在，我们即将阅读传道书，去年秋天，我讲了一次关于传道书的讲道，从那时起我就想回到这里。在九月份，我们将探讨这本书的一些基本主题。

一开始，当我们阅读它时，你会发现它与其他圣经书籍不同，这会立刻引起你的注意。我们将阅读传道书第九章，第二到十六节。

> “所有人都有共同的命运，义人和恶人，善良和邪恶，洁净和不洁净，献祭的人和不献祭的人，正如善良的人一样，罪人也是如此，正如那些发誓的人一样，那些害怕发誓的人也是如此。”

**这是在日光之下发生的一切邪恶。相同的命运降临到所有人身上。**

### 传道书及其独特视角

在过去的几十年里，至少在美国，甚至可能在整个西方，人们从未如此努力地寻找精神上的答案。而没有比传道书更好的地方去进行这种精神探索了。

传道书这个词是希伯来文作者的拉丁翻译。希伯来文中，作者称自己为“传道者”，这实际上意味着一个公共教师或评论员。有些人甚至称他为评论员，一个评论事物现状的人。

如果你或你认识的人正在进行精神探索，试图找到信仰或试图找到上帝或试图找到外面的东西，没有比传道书更好的地方了，因为在整本圣经中，这是唯一一本从怀疑者的角度写的书。

### 不公义的问题

你如何处理我在世界上看到的不公义、邪恶和痛苦？你不能生活而不问这些问题或基本上回答它们，即使你不认为你在回答它们，你也在回答它们。

**他拒绝让你回避不公义的问题，然后他给了我们两个答案的线索。**

首先，让我给你看，他如何确保你不回避这个问题。这很容易被忽视。在第十一和十二节中，首先，他在谈论生活中随机的一般不公。

> “比赛不一定是最快的赢，战斗不一定是最强的赢，食物不一定是聪明的人得到，财富不一定是聪明的人得到，恩惠不一定是有学问的人得到，但时间和机会降临到所有人身上。”

### 冷静与热情的答案

那第三种方式是什么？多年来，我发现圣经的答案似乎归结为两种，我将它们称为冷静的答案和热情的答案。一个是给头脑的答案，那是冷静的，一个是给心灵的答案，那是热情的。

**单独来看，它们不起作用，但结合在一起，它们是非凡的。**

传道书的作者因为他是传道书，因为他与圣经中的其他书不同，他不会直接告诉你，而是给你线索。他不会让你看到传道书不是一场讲座，而是一场研讨会。

### 结论：记住那位贫穷的人

传道书的作者看到了一种智慧，他被它感动，我们知道为什么，因为这只是伟大智慧的回声和模式，这就是我们不仅仅有一个简单在天堂的上帝，他说我有理由不处理邪恶，你只需要接受它们。

**基督教的上帝做了一件不可思议的事情。**

这是福音：我们忘记了上帝，是他创造了我们，而不是我们自己，我们忘记了他，这意味着我们走自己的路，我们向他致敬，但通常每天我们不记得他，我们忘记他，我们表现得好像我们是自己的神。

让我们祷告，我们感谢你，主上帝，因为你创造了你的儿子，永远爱你并认识你的上帝之子，然后你对他所做的，你把我们的遗忘倾倒在他身上，因为这样，我们可以知道你永远不会忘记我们。
