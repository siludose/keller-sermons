today's podcast, Tim Keller looks at how Ecclesiastes helps  us face our doubts, fears and uncertainties and points us to the lasting hope and significance  we have in Christ. Let's take a look at this passage. Now, we're about to read from Ecclesiastes and last  year, last fall, I did one sermon on Ecclesiastes and ever since then I wanted to come back. And in  the month of September, we're going to be looking at some of the basic themes of this book. And right away, as we read it, you're going to see it's different.

It's so different than  other books of the Bible, it'll strike you right away. Ecclesiastes chapter 9, we're  going to read verses 2 to 16. All share a common destiny, the righteous and the wicked,  the good and the bad, the clean and the unclean, those who offer sacrifices and those who  do not, as it is with a good man, so with a sinner, as it is with those who take oaths,  so with those who are afraid to take them. This is the evil and everything that happens  under the sun. The same destiny overtakes all.

The hearts of men more over a full of evil  and there is madness in their hearts while they live, and afterwards, they join the dead. Anyone who is among the living has hope. Even a live dog is better than a dead lion. For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing, they have no further  reward, and even the memory of them is forgotten. Their love, their hate and their jealousy  have long since vanished, never again will they have a part in anything that happens  under the sun.

Go, eat your food with gladness, drink your wine with the joyful heart for  it is now that God favors what you do. Always be clothed in white, always anoint your  head with oil, enjoy life with your wife, whom you love all the days of this meaningless  life that God has given you under the sun. All your meaningless days. For this is your  lot in life, and in your toil some labor under the sun. Whatever your hand finds to do,  do it with all your might.

For in the grave, where you are going, there is neither working,  nor planning, nor knowing, nor wisdom. I have seen something else under the sun. The  race is not to the swift, or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise,  or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned, but time and chance happens to them  all. Moreover, no one knows when this hour will come. As Fischer caught in the cruel  matter, birds are taken in a snare, so men are trapped by evil times that fall unexpectedly  upon them.

But I also saw, under the sun, an example of wisdom that greatly impressed  me. There was once a small city with only a few people in it, and a powerful king came  against it and surrounded it and built huge seed works against it. Now, they lived in  that city, a man poor, but wise, and he saved the city by his wisdom. But nobody remembered  that poor man. So I said, wisdom is better than strength, but the poor man's wisdom is despised  and his words are no longer heated.

This is God's word. This is God's word. There's never  been a time where in the last few decades, at least in America, maybe even the West, where  people have been searching more, doing more spiritual searching. And there's no better place  to go do spiritual searching than going to the book of Ecclesiastes. The word Ecclesiastes  is the Latin translation for the Hebrew word for the author.

And the Hebrew word, what the author  calls himself, is cohaleth, which actually means, it's very hard, a public teacher or a commentator. Some people have actually called him a pundit, a public teacher, a commentator, a person who's  commenting on the way things are. Now, there's no better place to go. If you or you know somebody,  no better place to go, if you're on a spiritual search, if you're trying to find faith or trying  to find God or trying to find what's out there, there's no better place than the book of Ecclesiastes  because in the entire Bible, this is the only book written from the viewpoint of esceptic. Written from the viewpoint of someone who doesn't believe, written from the viewpoint of someone  who's a practical secularist.

Let me take a second to explain that. For example, unless you  understand that, that this is the only book like that, it's going to be very confusing to read. Look at verse five, for example. It says, the dead, no, nothing. Is that what the Bible teaches?

Is that the overall whole, is that what the Bible teaches about  the afterlife? No, well, what's it doing here? Because the key phrase, which comes up several times  in this text, and it comes up dozens of times in the book of Ecclesiastes, it comes up nowhere else  in any book of the Bible. In fact, it comes over nowhere else in any part of literature. Is the term, under the sun.

And what this means is, he does not say,  this is true, this is true, this is true, this is a fact, this is a fact. He says, this is a fact  under the sun, this is true, under the sun, under the sun. This life is meaningless. What? Not just life is meaningless.

This life is meaningless under the sun. What does that mean? It means this life, understood without any reference to life above the sun,  or beyond the sun. In other words, this life without reference to there being an eternity  or heaven, this life, if this life is all there is, that's what life under the sun means. And what's so helpful about this guy, is the point of view he takes, is not a philosophical  atheism, but it's very much, frankly, it's very much the practical secularism of the average  New Yorker and increasingly the average Western person.

When I say practical secularism, notice he  uses the word God a couple times. He talks about the meaningless life that God has given us, but you  see, in the book of Ecclesiastes, God is not the biblical God. The judge of heaven and earth,  the lover of our souls. If you ask the average New Yorker, do you believe in God? There's  very few atheists.

There's very few rigorous philosophical doctrinaire atheists who say there  can't be a God. The average person says, yes, there's probably some kind of supreme being,  but we can't know what that God thinks, or we can't know that God, we can't know the will of God. And therefore, essentially, this life is all there is. We don't know why we're here. And after you're dead, that's it.

And therefore, you've got to kind of make the best of it. That's practical secularism. And the book of Ecclesiastes gets into that position  and says, okay, you're practical secularists. How does life really look? And then he goes after  in the book, and we're going to take these next three weeks on these three.

He says, let's take a  look at the three basic projects that all human beings have got to do. If you're going to live  the basic projects, so you can't avoid. And even if you don't think you're doing them, you have to  do them because you can't live without avoiding them. And the three basic projects are  justice, pleasure, and achievement. Achievement is, what is worth doing in my life?

What am I  going to spend my life doing? You know, what should I be doing? Pleasure is, where will I find  happiness? What will satisfy me really? And thirdly, how do I deal with the injustice and the  evil and suffering I see in the world?

You can't live without asking those questions or essentially  answering them, even if you don't think you're answering them, you are answering them. And he says,  all right, let's just say, here's the reason that the book of Ecclesiastes is so unusual and it's  so helpful. And why a book eventually brings you to God, because the book of Ecclesiastes is not  just doubt, belief. The great thing about the book, and it's so democratic when you think about it,  the Ecclesiastes are also doubts on belief. Now this is something that almost nobody does.

Now  as people know, yeah, well, yes, let's doubt belief, but let's not doubt it. You say, it wouldn't be  fair would it to only doubt belief, only doubt faith. Surely if you're going to doubt faith and ask  very hard questions about faith, wouldn't you doubt your doubts? Shouldn't you doubt your doubts? Shouldn't you ask hard questions about unbelief?

You say, you're standing someplace even when you doubt. You can't doubt without standing someplace. And a practical secularism secularism says,  this life is all there is. Okay, says the writer. Let's ask a few questions about that position.

And the first one is, how do you deal with justice, the injustice of life? Now, when he does this,  some of you today, this is the main spiritual issue you've got. This is the main problem. This is the main problem with God, with faith, with everything, because you have seen or you've  experienced this kind of suffering. For some of the rest of you, it's not maybe the main problem.

That's what we're going to do some other weeks, but it's still very important. How do you deal  with injustice? Now here's what this guy does, and I'm going to only be able to outline  three things he does. First of all, he refuses to let you avoid the question of injustice,  and then secondly, he gives us two answers, clues to two answers. First of all, he refuses to let  us avoid the question.

He puts the question in front of us. He refuses to let us tune it out,  and then secondly, and then he gives us the clues for two answers, two answers for how to deal with  injustice. First of all, let me show you, look how he makes sure you do not avoid the question. This is very easy to tune out. In verse 11 and 12, first of all, he's tear talking about the  random general injustice in life, and he says, what?

He says, the race is not to the swift,  nor the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise, nor wealth to the brilliant,  or favorite of the learned, but time and chance happens to all. And moreover, as Fischer caught in  a cruel net, birds would take it in a snare, men are trapped by evil times that fall unexpectedly  upon them. One writer I was reading for a pairing for this, one night just took down the first  couple sentences of every news story on this TV news, and here's what he got. There was trouble  in Middle East again tonight. Today, three terrorists come and dear to school bus and set off  explosives that killed both themselves and all the children.

A major storm hit Bangladesh,  thousands were drowned, tens of thousands are homeless. Four car pile up on 261 resulted in five deaths. In the Bronx, a five-year-old girl in her mother's lap was killed by a stray bullet. And here was one that's a little more of a research thing. Thousands of two-thirds world children  die daily from largely preventable diseases out of complacency and selfishness and  invincible ignorance that people with the power to treat them simply fail to do so.

Now, what is that saying? It's what the Ecclesiastes writer is trying to say. It doesn't matter who you are, where you are, it doesn't matter whether you're good or bad. Horrible things happen constantly, random without just, it's crazy. It can happen anybody.

Suddenly beautiful little children blown up. Suddenly this, suddenly that,  it's like, and as he says, it can happen anybody. It can happen anytime. You can't avoid it and  you never know when it's going to happen. The random misery and cruelty of the world,  the injustice of life, that's the first thing he brings up.

He says, look at that. The race is not  to the swift, you see. You may be swift, but you may lose. You may be brilliant, but you may  may not succeed because, frankly, life is a crap shoot. You think you're under control.

If you  think you're under control, you think if I just do this and do this and this, things are going to go  well for me. You're very, very young. I mean, I say interesting. I do that way. Every two months,  I say that somehow and everybody laughs because you are young, or maybe it's only the old people left.

I better watch careful next time. You are not in control. One of the ways that young people  tune out the injustice of life is they say, it's those people. It's not going to happen to me. I'm  going to watch my back.

I'm going to be very careful. I'm going to discipline myself. I'm not  going to ride on school buses in the Middle East. I'm going to have all sorts of things. But he won't stop there.

He goes on. Now, when he goes on, I want you to know right away,  some of you are going to start to defend yourself against what he says here,  because you're going to say he's just being gloomy. I'll get back to that. He says, oh yeah,  there's people like this. Here's what he does.

He goes on. He goes on past the random general  injustice that happens to so many people, and he moves to the absolute ultimate injustice that  happens to everybody. That, in verse 3 and 4, as it is with a good man, so with a sinner,  as it is with those who take oath, so with those who are afraid to take them. This is the evil in  everything that happens under the sun. I looked down at verse 5, for the living know that they will  die, but the dead know nothing.

They have no further reward, and even the memory of them is  forgotten. Their love and their hate, their jealousy, have long since vanished. Never will they  have a part in anything that happens under the sun. Here's what he's saying. He is not just saying  here.

They good people have it bad and bad people have it good. That's injustice, and that often  happens. That's sort of random thing. He's saying something else. Something deeper.

He says,  no matter what you do in life, whether you live a life of look, a life of love, verse 6, or hate,  whether you are the terrorist or the child. Everything you do will vanish, but worse than that,  even the memory of what you do, even the effect of what you do will be forgotten. At the end of the road for every human being, if this life is all there is, there is a nothingness  that if you're willing to think about it at all, and I'm making you, he says,  makes everything you do meaningless, everything you do. Kathy and I recently watched on video one of the latest John Sales movie called Men with Guns,  Powerful Movie. In the movie, it's about a doctor in a Latin American country who has trained  a bunch of young doctors, and they have gone up into the hinterland, they've gone up into the  parts of the country.

They're very remote and very poor, and those doctors were going to give  health care to people who desperately needed it. And when he came to understand that virtually every  single one of the people that he had trained and sat out there had been killed either by the army  or by the gorillas almost immediately, so that everything he'd done and all that they'd put their  lies into was gone. He goes, the whole movie is basically about him going into one incredibly  dangerous place after another to just find every one of those young people, and he never can find them,  and the very end he dies, his last words are, a man should have a legacy. And at one point in the movie, he says, I'm not a religious man,  I'm not a religious man, I'm a scientist, I'm a doctor, but I want to know that I've done  something to make this place better. I've got to know that, or my life is absolutely meaningless.

Well, the ecclesiastes writer says, wake up! What if they didn't die yet? Listen, if you build the pyramids, you'll be remembered for a while longer than the rest of us. But eventually, if when you die, you rot, and when the sun dies, everything rots,  cosmic forgottenness lies at the end of every person's life, it doesn't matter what you've  done, it doesn't matter who you are, the same destiny, and that makes everything you do pointless,  everything. Now somebody's saying, I know what you're saying, he's saying, oh, I've heard this  I had to take philosophy 101, I've heard this sort of thing, this person just being gloomy,  I want you to know, you say, that even if you think about that, if you're a practical secularist,  you say, of course, if you think about that, you're going to be depressed all the time, but hey,  there's Central Park, there's the theater, there's sex, there's incredible restaurants,  there's wonderful clothes, and you know what, he's heard this from you, and in verse 7, look, he goes  right on, he's heard this, he's heard it a hundred times, he heard people say, oh yeah, sure,  it's meaningless if you're going to think philosophically, but let's just, let's go out there and really  be normal people, and he goes on, he says, okay, sure, fine.

So, verse 7, go eat your food with  gladness, now I don't want to get into my next two sermons here, go eat your food with gladness,  drink your wine with a joyful heart, be clothed with white, good food, parties, look great,  feel marvelous, okay, see, enjoy life with your wife, have sex all the days of this meaningless life,  he says, listen, it's meaningless anyway, it's going to keep breaking through, it doesn't matter,  you see, he's really saying, don't you dare tune this out, all the great ones are like this,  Buddha, Sidhartha, before his became Buddha, before he became the old story that he was raised  in a palace and he hadn't really seen suffering, when he finally went out, the first day he saw an  old man, and the second day he saw a sick man, and the third day he saw a dead man,  and he realized this was coming to everybody, and the way the legend goes, at one point, he turns  to his charioteer, he turns to his servant, and he says, the hearts of men must be hard to be self  composed before such a situation, he starts to cry out, he says, old age, well the charioteer says,  well of course old age, I mean everybody knows, you lose all your beauty eventually, you lose all  your memory, you lose all your sensation, you lose even, everybody knows this, but see Buddha says,  you know this and you're not crying out, you're not wrestling with you, doesn't this make everything  meaningless, we have to do something, we have to come to grips with it, see the great ones always  say that, the great ones refuse to tune it out, what do you do with the evening news, I know what I  tend to do, another bomb, you know it's on, another bomb, a flood, okay kids, dinner's on the table, turn  off the news, you tune it out, please ask this writer says, don't you dare, you want to lose what  little humanity you have left, now he refuses to have you, let you out from under the question,  the question of injustices, injustice in this world, and especially the ultimate injustice of radical  and cosmic nothingness and forgottenness, makes every single thing meaningless, everything pointless,  everything vanity, but in this text we also have, and we're going to be looking at this more in the  next three weeks, in this text we also have the clues to two, the two biblical answers, to this question  of injustice, now what I mean by that is, the Bible says don't tune out injustice but don't go into  despair, there's a third way, don't tune out injustice but don't go into despair, there's a third way,  you may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger brother,  in fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who try to  earn his love by being good, in his book the prodigal god Tim Keller shows how this well-known story  reveals the heart of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother  and the judgmental older brother, and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal  extravagant grace, whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith, the prodigal god will  help you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way, the prodigal god is our thank you for  your gift this month to help gospel and life share the hope and joy of Christ's gracious and  relentless love with people all over the world.

Over the years it seems like increasingly I've found that the  Bible's answer boils down to two and I'm going to call them a cool answer and a hot answer. One is an answer for the mind, that's the cool one and one is an answer for the heart, that's the  hot one, all by themselves they don't work but together they're remarkable and the Ecclesiastes  writer because he's Ecclesiastes because he's different than any other book in the Bible does not  tell you but clue you.

He does not let see the Ecclesiastes is not a lecture, it's a seminar. It's almost a bull session. He does, he goes you, he role plays, he pushes you with questions, he  gives you clues and here the clues to both the cool and the hot answer. I will be brief but here's  what I want to tell you, even though I'm going to be brief, when we go through the cool answer right  now I want you to be patient. If you are not suffering the cool answer is very interesting but if  you're suffering the cool answer is very inadequate.

Okay but you have to have them both. What's the  cool answer? Alright, the cool or the answer, actually it's not called cool, let's call it the  answer for the mind. He gets at that in verses three and four, in verse four he says something  terrible about dogs and my wife is a dog lover and I promised her that I would not, I would put  this into context, but in verse four he says it's better to be a live dog than a dead lion. Now when  you think of dogs you think of beagles and collies but when the ancient people thought of dogs they  did not because the ancient people, dogs were the lowest form of animal, dogs were the scavengers,  dogs were wild, dogs lived on garbage and dogs ate cadavers, I mean when Jezebel the great queen,  the evil queen Jezebel is thrown into the street back in the Old Testament, what happens?

The dogs come into her, you see because well because of course she deserves the dogs they say because  she is so evil and the dogs deserve her you see because they're so they're so low but the lion  out of the ancients the lion was the greatest noble beast just as we see him now and now listen  what is he saying in verse four astounding. In fact if it wasn't linked with verse five we would have  to back away what he says in verse four is fairly simple he says there it's better to be a  liar a murderer a scavenger and save your skin than be a noble person who dies it's not worth it  to live for anything anymore what he's really saying you say what is he saying yes he's saying  something so shocking and so vicious he says it no longer matters it's better to save your skin be  a liar and a murderer and a thief then it is to be a noble person and die for it and if you say he  is he saying that it's in verse five the word four you see the word four this is the reason four  and go down in there and he says because love or hate in the end they vanish and what he's saying  is something very very very up to date and the philosophers are saying it now and what is it what  they are saying is this if this life is all there is if when you die you're rot if we're just we  just accidentally evolved as the out of the collocation of accidental forces then there is no such  thing as they're right and wrong there can't be all moral distinctions are pointless why well  Alistair McIntyre great philosopher has done this very very well in a couple of his books he says  here's the reason why he says the there's no such thing as abstract goodness goodness is always  relative to purpose what if you somebody gave you a watch and you'd never seen a watch before in  your life this is McIntyre's illustration but somebody gave you a watch and you'd never seen  this watch watch before and somebody says is it good you'd say I don't know what is it for  there's no such thing as abstract goodness is it is the watch for hammering a nail it's bad  is the watch for you know you know what is the watch for until you know what something is for you  don't know what is good or bad things are only good or bad in relation to the purpose what makes a  good human being McIntyre says if we're accidents if there's no purpose then it's  ridiculous to say it's bad to hurt people you're just here to survive the strong eat the  weak you're just here to survive better to be a live dog better to trample on people I mean  what how dare you say who who are you to say there's no warrant to say that anything is good or bad  if this life as all there is there is no good or bad but now here's the other part of this weird  argument in verse three in spite of the fact that he says vanity meaningless it's all meaningless  it's all meaningless up in verse three he says but men are evil and this is the problem  Derek Kiddner one of my favorite commentators on this verse Derek Kiddner says something  extremely interesting he says what we may not notice about verse three at first is that this  sense of outrage is just as much a fact about us as is our mortality the fascination of this  book of Ecclesiastes throughout its length arises largely from the collisions of observation and  equally obstinate and opposed intuitions so it pushes us toward a synthesis that is largely  beyond its own pages is what he means if you don't believe if you believe this life is all there is  then there's no such thing as injustice right and yet deep inside you know there is  on the one hand he says vanity meaningless pointless but then he also says and yet it's still as  evil and there is an incredible contradiction in the heart of being a secular person at the heart  of unbelief says this I don't believe really in a God because of the injustice but if there is no  God there's no basis for being outraged put it I'll go put it to you two ways it'll be on tape so  you can always listen to it again if there's a God evil is a problem it's a big problem he's got  reasons for why he's allowing it and we don't know what they are but that's not that really hurts  it still doesn't really make it better if there's a God evil is a problem but if even if evil is a  problem for you there must be a God you see that if evil is a problem if you are outraged and yet  your own worldview gives you no basis for the outrage what it means is your worldview is wrong  if you know there's an injustice even though if there is no God there shouldn't be an injustice then  you know there's a God put it another way it's a problem for belief evil is a problem for belief but  it's a bigger problem for unbelief it's what it's a problem if you believe in God but it's a  bigger problem if you don't believe in God because if you don't believe in God then the main  the original reason for disbelieving in God is gone you can't even define injustice there's no basis  for it that's the cool argument it's a very strong argument it's being made by Christian  philosophers all the time and that is evil is a problem for belief but it's a bigger problem for  unbelief and that's your only two alternatives so why not believe you have no basis for outrage no  basis for against injustice unless there is a just judge we don't know why he's not acting but if  you get rid of him out of your mental furniture you got a bigger problem than if you keep him now  didn't I warn you if you're not suffering if you're kind of intellectual type and there's lots of  you out there like that I know that's intriguing that's interesting you never thought of that that's  helpful maybe even but if you're suffering right now it's just cold it's cold comfort there's a  place in C. S. Lewis's book a grief observed where he says the thing I'm afraid of and when his  wife died Joy Davidman Gresham who went to Hunter College by the way when his wife died he says  the thing I'm not so much afraid of is that there is no God I'm afraid of who he might be  I'm afraid of meeting a God that I don't like Christianity doesn't just give you one  one answer the one answer is there we just gave it to you lots of religions have it there is a  God if there is no God you have a bigger problem with evil than if you don't have a God but Christianity  gives you another one it's the hot answer it's the personal answer it's the answer for the heart  and what is it well the clues for you're in this last little vignette what a weird story  when he says I saw one more thing and it impressed me in Hebrew that's that's a two-week  a word the word impress means it amazed me it confounded me it mystified me I don't know what it  means and here's why he saw a kind of wisdom in this little story this little thing he saw I saw  kind of wisdom beyond any wisdom he knew there was once a small city with only a few people in it  and a powerful king came against it surrounded it and built huge seed works against it  and now they lived in that city a man poor but wise he saved the city by his wisdom but nobody  remembered that poor man but the poor man's wisdom was despised there's three things about this  wisdom he'd never seen before first of all it was a saving wisdom look at a little city few people  versus a great king huge seed works it was absolutely overwhelming the city was absolutely doomed  there was no way out we don't know exactly how he did it but there was a wisdom that was so  incredibly powerful that it was able to save that city that's incredible but that's not all  more than that secondly it wasn't just a saving wisdom it was a serving wisdom one of the things  that is so weird and so unusual about this at least in the Old Testament is the wise man is poor  now you know the Ecclesiastes is a wise man and if you read the whole book you'll see he's a king  you'll see that he's rich because frankly if you're really wise if you're really smart  of course you're gonna get up in the world of course you're gonna make some money of course  you're gonna get ahead how could a wise man be poor but suddenly he's confronted with the fact  that this wisest of men this person with with with a most a supernatural saving wisdom  has not used his wisdom to dominate or get up but to be a servant he's used it in a humble way  and then lastly the most astounding thing of all anybody who has that kind of power and wisdom  and that kind of form of serving serving hood and wisdom he was not just forgotten look  he says nobody remembered him but he says he was despised it was a vicious it was a deliberate  forgetting the people turned on him they hated him now my friend Sinclair Ferguson wrote a book  on Ecclesiastes some years ago he called it pundits folly because he uses the term pundit  for the Ecclesiastes and this is what he says  he says God has pointed had placed testimonies to his presence throughout our lives there is no safe  haven there's no place we can escape his reality and the words of Ecclesiastes 9 13 to 16 read almost  like a prophecy whose name most naturally comes to mind when we hear of a poor man full of wisdom  who became a savior but whose life and teaching were rejected the man the pundit saw was just a  reflection of a wisdom beyond philosophical arguments wisdom himself the true poor wise man  who had become the savior as Paul describes him Christ crucified was a stumbling block to Jews  and foolishness to Greeks but to those whom Jesus who Christ is called both Jew and Greek  Christ the wisdom of God and the power of God now here's why this is the this is the hot answer  and this is a clue the Ecclesiastes writer sees a kind of wisdom and he's moved by it and we know why  because it's just an echo a pattern of the great wisdom and this is this we do not just have a  God who's simply up in heaven and he says I've got reasons why I'm not dealing with evil you're  just going to have to accept them they're and that and that's all you've got that's all you've got  you're in more shape if you reject me so there you are you're stuck with me tough  is that what God says not the Christian God the Christian God has done something unbelievable  here's the gospel we've forgotten God it is he who has made us but not and not we ourselves we've  forgotten him that means we go our own way we we doff our hats to him but in general every day  we don't remember him we forget him we act as if we're our own gods and because we have turned  away from the only permanent thing we have stopped because we've become temporary because we've  turned away from the only thing that lasts forever we are going to be forgotten and we know it  and deep in our hearts we know it that Ecclesiastes writer and Buddha and all the great ones are trying  to push you to say look at it you know the worst thing in the world is to be forgotten  to have people forget you to have people forget who you are that people forget that you were coming  I mean even in the micro that's horrible but in the macro it's even worse and here we're told  we deeply inside know that what's coming is cosmic forgottenness cosmic nothingness and we can't  handle it but God has done something about it he sent his son into the world and on the cross he  did not give us a philosophical argument when he was on the cross which is the why is the wisdom  of God when he was on the cross he did not say let me explain to you why if unbelief has more  of a problem with suffering than belief no what he said is my god my god why have you forgotten me  what was happening on the cross was God was pouring out the for the cosmic forgottenness he was  turning his back on his son he was giving to him what we deserve and what we know is coming in  what what is making our lives meaningless even though it's only half conscious even though it's  unconscious he got forsaken by his friends forsaken by his enemies but even forsaken by the father  he got the cosmic forgottenness that the ecclesiastist writer says is coming to everybody you know  it's coming to everybody and it's makes your life meaningless but it went into the heart of Jesus  that poor man was forgotten so that you will not be why do you think God can say and I say  49 can a woman forget the baby that nurses had her breasts yay she may forget but I will not  forget you behold you are engraved on the palm of my hands how can he say he'll never forget you  he'll never ever ever forget you that you will be remembered in love forever and ever  how can you walk out of the world knowing that that cosmic forgottenness is not yours anymore  and therefore you can walk out in the world and truly finally enjoy what's there because the  your forgottenness was put on Jesus and therefore the Christian can sing and though I am despised for  God yet God my God forgets me not and he is safe and must succeed for who Christ promises to plead  if you are not a believer today but you're a surcher I beg you you've got a hot and a cold answer  you not only have to think it out but you have to get to know this one this person a God who came  into suffering and received the suffering and injustice of this world in a more deep way than  anybody else has ever experienced it if you're a Christian let me tell you what your problem is  today you know what your problem is I'll tell you what it is you've forgotten the poor man  some of you are here today and you're upset you know what you've forgotten the one  who died for you though you forgot him bless the Lord of my soul says the Psalmist and all that is  within me bless his holy name bless the Lord of my soul and forget not his benefits the Psalmist  gets up every day and says my big problem is I've forgotten what he's done for me I've forgotten  the forgottenness that he took upon me if you're here today for example and you feel rejected by  somebody and you're in despair you've forgotten the fact that the only person whose opinion counts  the only one who's permanent the only one whose love will last forever loves you now because  your forgottenness was thrown on Jesus if you're a Christian today your whole problem is your  main problem is you've forgotten the poor man you've despised him you need to fill your heart  again with the knowledge of what he did for you don't you see this remember the poor man  and you'll live forever remember the poor man and you'll be loved forever let's pray we thank you  Lord God that because of who you made your son the son of God who loved you forever and knew  you forever and then what you did to him you poured out our forgottenness on him because of that  we can know that you will never forget us Lord when it comes down to it  philosophy can bring us to the brink can even give us some intellectual answers but it's only  a knowledge of your son that can help us to move out into the world and deal with the suffering  in a way that is neither tuning it out nor falling into despair oh we thank you that only at the cross  do we get to the place do we get the resources for dealing with the injustice of life  we pray Lord that those of us who are experiencing injustice now would know what your son  experienced for us that we can forgive and we can be strong and I pray for those here who don't  know who he is yet that through the despair that they might be feeling which is really a gift  of your Holy Spirit they may come to see who he is and what he's done for them I pray this in  Jesus name amen

### English Transcript (for reference)

today's podcast, Tim Keller looks at how Ecclesiastes helps  us face our doubts, fears and uncertainties and points us to the lasting hope and significance  we have in Christ. Let's take a look at this passage. Now, we're about to read from Ecclesiastes and last  year, last fall, I did one sermon on Ecclesiastes and ever since then I wanted to come back. And in  the month of September, we're going to be looking at some of the basic themes of this book. And right away, as we read it, you're going to see it's different.

It's so different than  other books of the Bible, it'll strike you right away. Ecclesiastes chapter 9, we're  going to read verses 2 to 16. All share a common destiny, the righteous and the wicked,  the good and the bad, the clean and the unclean, those who offer sacrifices and those who  do not, as it is with a good man, so with a sinner, as it is with those who take oaths,  so with those who are afraid to take them. This is the evil and everything that happens  under the sun. The same destiny overtakes all.

The hearts of men more over a full of evil  and there is madness in their hearts while they live, and afterwards, they join the dead. Anyone who is among the living has hope. Even a live dog is better than a dead lion. For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing, they have no further  reward, and even the memory of them is forgotten. Their love, their hate and their jealousy  have long since vanished, never again will they have a part in anything that happens  under the sun.

Go, eat your food with gladness, drink your wine with the joyful heart for  it is now that God favors what you do. Always be clothed in white, always anoint your  head with oil, enjoy life with your wife, whom you love all the days of this meaningless  life that God has given you under the sun. All your meaningless days. For this is your  lot in life, and in your toil some labor under the sun. Whatever your hand finds to do,  do it with all your might.

For in the grave, where you are going, there is neither working,  nor planning, nor knowing, nor wisdom. I have seen something else under the sun. The  race is not to the swift, or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise,  or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned, but time and chance happens to them  all. Moreover, no one knows when this hour will come. As Fischer caught in the cruel  matter, birds are taken in a snare, so men are trapped by evil times that fall unexpectedly  upon them.

But I also saw, under the sun, an example of wisdom that greatly impressed  me. There was once a small city with only a few people in it, and a powerful king came  against it and surrounded it and built huge seed works against it. Now, they lived in  that city, a man poor, but wise, and he saved the city by his wisdom. But nobody remembered  that poor man. So I said, wisdom is better than strength, but the poor man's wisdom is despised  and his words are no longer heated.

This is God's word. This is God's word. There's never  been a time where in the last few decades, at least in America, maybe even the West, where  people have been searching more, doing more spiritual searching. And there's no better place  to go do spiritual searching than going to the book of Ecclesiastes. The word Ecclesiastes  is the Latin translation for the Hebrew word for the author.

And the Hebrew word, what the author  calls himself, is cohaleth, which actually means, it's very hard, a public teacher or a commentator. Some people have actually called him a pundit, a public teacher, a commentator, a person who's  commenting on the way things are. Now, there's no better place to go. If you or you know somebody,  no better place to go, if you're on a spiritual search, if you're trying to find faith or trying  to find God or trying to find what's out there, there's no better place than the book of Ecclesiastes  because in the entire Bible, this is the only book written from the viewpoint of esceptic. Written from the viewpoint of someone who doesn't believe, written from the viewpoint of someone  who's a practical secularist.

Let me take a second to explain that. For example, unless you  understand that, that this is the only book like that, it's going to be very confusing to read. Look at verse five, for example. It says, the dead, no, nothing. Is that what the Bible teaches?

Is that the overall whole, is that what the Bible teaches about  the afterlife? No, well, what's it doing here? Because the key phrase, which comes up several times  in this text, and it comes up dozens of times in the book of Ecclesiastes, it comes up nowhere else  in any book of the Bible. In fact, it comes over nowhere else in any part of literature. Is the term, under the sun.

And what this means is, he does not say,  this is true, this is true, this is true, this is a fact, this is a fact. He says, this is a fact  under the sun, this is true, under the sun, under the sun. This life is meaningless. What? Not just life is meaningless.

This life is meaningless under the sun. What does that mean? It means this life, understood without any reference to life above the sun,  or beyond the sun. In other words, this life without reference to there being an eternity  or heaven, this life, if this life is all there is, that's what life under the sun means. And what's so helpful about this guy, is the point of view he takes, is not a philosophical  atheism, but it's very much, frankly, it's very much the practical secularism of the average  New Yorker and increasingly the average Western person.

When I say practical secularism, notice he  uses the word God a couple times. He talks about the meaningless life that God has given us, but you  see, in the book of Ecclesiastes, God is not the biblical God. The judge of heaven and earth,  the lover of our souls. If you ask the average New Yorker, do you believe in God? There's  very few atheists.

There's very few rigorous philosophical doctrinaire atheists who say there  can't be a God. The average person says, yes, there's probably some kind of supreme being,  but we can't know what that God thinks, or we can't know that God, we can't know the will of God. And therefore, essentially, this life is all there is. We don't know why we're here. And after you're dead, that's it.

And therefore, you've got to kind of make the best of it. That's practical secularism. And the book of Ecclesiastes gets into that position  and says, okay, you're practical secularists. How does life really look? And then he goes after  in the book, and we're going to take these next three weeks on these three.

He says, let's take a  look at the three basic projects that all human beings have got to do. If you're going to live  the basic projects, so you can't avoid. And even if you don't think you're doing them, you have to  do them because you can't live without avoiding them. And the three basic projects are  justice, pleasure, and achievement. Achievement is, what is worth doing in my life?

What am I  going to spend my life doing? You know, what should I be doing? Pleasure is, where will I find  happiness? What will satisfy me really? And thirdly, how do I deal with the injustice and the  evil and suffering I see in the world?

You can't live without asking those questions or essentially  answering them, even if you don't think you're answering them, you are answering them. And he says,  all right, let's just say, here's the reason that the book of Ecclesiastes is so unusual and it's  so helpful. And why a book eventually brings you to God, because the book of Ecclesiastes is not  just doubt, belief. The great thing about the book, and it's so democratic when you think about it,  the Ecclesiastes are also doubts on belief. Now this is something that almost nobody does.

Now  as people know, yeah, well, yes, let's doubt belief, but let's not doubt it. You say, it wouldn't be  fair would it to only doubt belief, only doubt faith. Surely if you're going to doubt faith and ask  very hard questions about faith, wouldn't you doubt your doubts? Shouldn't you doubt your doubts? Shouldn't you ask hard questions about unbelief?

You say, you're standing someplace even when you doubt. You can't doubt without standing someplace. And a practical secularism secularism says,  this life is all there is. Okay, says the writer. Let's ask a few questions about that position.

And the first one is, how do you deal with justice, the injustice of life? Now, when he does this,  some of you today, this is the main spiritual issue you've got. This is the main problem. This is the main problem with God, with faith, with everything, because you have seen or you've  experienced this kind of suffering. For some of the rest of you, it's not maybe the main problem.

That's what we're going to do some other weeks, but it's still very important. How do you deal  with injustice? Now here's what this guy does, and I'm going to only be able to outline  three things he does. First of all, he refuses to let you avoid the question of injustice,  and then secondly, he gives us two answers, clues to two answers. First of all, he refuses to let  us avoid the question.

He puts the question in front of us. He refuses to let us tune it out,  and then secondly, and then he gives us the clues for two answers, two answers for how to deal with  injustice. First of all, let me show you, look how he makes sure you do not avoid the question. This is very easy to tune out. In verse 11 and 12, first of all, he's tear talking about the  random general injustice in life, and he says, what?

He says, the race is not to the swift,  nor the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise, nor wealth to the brilliant,  or favorite of the learned, but time and chance happens to all. And moreover, as Fischer caught in  a cruel net, birds would take it in a snare, men are trapped by evil times that fall unexpectedly  upon them. One writer I was reading for a pairing for this, one night just took down the first  couple sentences of every news story on this TV news, and here's what he got. There was trouble  in Middle East again tonight. Today, three terrorists come and dear to school bus and set off  explosives that killed both themselves and all the children.

A major storm hit Bangladesh,  thousands were drowned, tens of thousands are homeless. Four car pile up on 261 resulted in five deaths. In the Bronx, a five-year-old girl in her mother's lap was killed by a stray bullet. And here was one that's a little more of a research thing. Thousands of two-thirds world children  die daily from largely preventable diseases out of complacency and selfishness and  invincible ignorance that people with the power to treat them simply fail to do so.

Now, what is that saying? It's what the Ecclesiastes writer is trying to say. It doesn't matter who you are, where you are, it doesn't matter whether you're good or bad. Horrible things happen constantly, random without just, it's crazy. It can happen anybody.

Suddenly beautiful little children blown up. Suddenly this, suddenly that,  it's like, and as he says, it can happen anybody. It can happen anytime. You can't avoid it and  you never know when it's going to happen. The random misery and cruelty of the world,  the injustice of life, that's the first thing he brings up.

He says, look at that. The race is not  to the swift, you see. You may be swift, but you may lose. You may be brilliant, but you may  may not succeed because, frankly, life is a crap shoot. You think you're under control.

If you  think you're under control, you think if I just do this and do this and this, things are going to go  well for me. You're very, very young. I mean, I say interesting. I do that way. Every two months,  I say that somehow and everybody laughs because you are young, or maybe it's only the old people left.

I better watch careful next time. You are not in control. One of the ways that young people  tune out the injustice of life is they say, it's those people. It's not going to happen to me. I'm  going to watch my back.

I'm going to be very careful. I'm going to discipline myself. I'm not  going to ride on school buses in the Middle East. I'm going to have all sorts of things. But he won't stop there.

He goes on. Now, when he goes on, I want you to know right away,  some of you are going to start to defend yourself against what he says here,  because you're going to say he's just being gloomy. I'll get back to that. He says, oh yeah,  there's people like this. Here's what he does.

He goes on. He goes on past the random general  injustice that happens to so many people, and he moves to the absolute ultimate injustice that  happens to everybody. That, in verse 3 and 4, as it is with a good man, so with a sinner,  as it is with those who take oath, so with those who are afraid to take them. This is the evil in  everything that happens under the sun. I looked down at verse 5, for the living know that they will  die, but the dead know nothing.

They have no further reward, and even the memory of them is  forgotten. Their love and their hate, their jealousy, have long since vanished. Never will they  have a part in anything that happens under the sun. Here's what he's saying. He is not just saying  here.

They good people have it bad and bad people have it good. That's injustice, and that often  happens. That's sort of random thing. He's saying something else. Something deeper.

He says,  no matter what you do in life, whether you live a life of look, a life of love, verse 6, or hate,  whether you are the terrorist or the child. Everything you do will vanish, but worse than that,  even the memory of what you do, even the effect of what you do will be forgotten. At the end of the road for every human being, if this life is all there is, there is a nothingness  that if you're willing to think about it at all, and I'm making you, he says,  makes everything you do meaningless, everything you do. Kathy and I recently watched on video one of the latest John Sales movie called Men with Guns,  Powerful Movie. In the movie, it's about a doctor in a Latin American country who has trained  a bunch of young doctors, and they have gone up into the hinterland, they've gone up into the  parts of the country.

They're very remote and very poor, and those doctors were going to give  health care to people who desperately needed it. And when he came to understand that virtually every  single one of the people that he had trained and sat out there had been killed either by the army  or by the gorillas almost immediately, so that everything he'd done and all that they'd put their  lies into was gone. He goes, the whole movie is basically about him going into one incredibly  dangerous place after another to just find every one of those young people, and he never can find them,  and the very end he dies, his last words are, a man should have a legacy. And at one point in the movie, he says, I'm not a religious man,  I'm not a religious man, I'm a scientist, I'm a doctor, but I want to know that I've done  something to make this place better. I've got to know that, or my life is absolutely meaningless.

Well, the ecclesiastes writer says, wake up! What if they didn't die yet? Listen, if you build the pyramids, you'll be remembered for a while longer than the rest of us. But eventually, if when you die, you rot, and when the sun dies, everything rots,  cosmic forgottenness lies at the end of every person's life, it doesn't matter what you've  done, it doesn't matter who you are, the same destiny, and that makes everything you do pointless,  everything. Now somebody's saying, I know what you're saying, he's saying, oh, I've heard this  I had to take philosophy 101, I've heard this sort of thing, this person just being gloomy,  I want you to know, you say, that even if you think about that, if you're a practical secularist,  you say, of course, if you think about that, you're going to be depressed all the time, but hey,  there's Central Park, there's the theater, there's sex, there's incredible restaurants,  there's wonderful clothes, and you know what, he's heard this from you, and in verse 7, look, he goes  right on, he's heard this, he's heard it a hundred times, he heard people say, oh yeah, sure,  it's meaningless if you're going to think philosophically, but let's just, let's go out there and really  be normal people, and he goes on, he says, okay, sure, fine.

So, verse 7, go eat your food with  gladness, now I don't want to get into my next two sermons here, go eat your food with gladness,  drink your wine with a joyful heart, be clothed with white, good food, parties, look great,  feel marvelous, okay, see, enjoy life with your wife, have sex all the days of this meaningless life,  he says, listen, it's meaningless anyway, it's going to keep breaking through, it doesn't matter,  you see, he's really saying, don't you dare tune this out, all the great ones are like this,  Buddha, Sidhartha, before his became Buddha, before he became the old story that he was raised  in a palace and he hadn't really seen suffering, when he finally went out, the first day he saw an  old man, and the second day he saw a sick man, and the third day he saw a dead man,  and he realized this was coming to everybody, and the way the legend goes, at one point, he turns  to his charioteer, he turns to his servant, and he says, the hearts of men must be hard to be self  composed before such a situation, he starts to cry out, he says, old age, well the charioteer says,  well of course old age, I mean everybody knows, you lose all your beauty eventually, you lose all  your memory, you lose all your sensation, you lose even, everybody knows this, but see Buddha says,  you know this and you're not crying out, you're not wrestling with you, doesn't this make everything  meaningless, we have to do something, we have to come to grips with it, see the great ones always  say that, the great ones refuse to tune it out, what do you do with the evening news, I know what I  tend to do, another bomb, you know it's on, another bomb, a flood, okay kids, dinner's on the table, turn  off the news, you tune it out, please ask this writer says, don't you dare, you want to lose what  little humanity you have left, now he refuses to have you, let you out from under the question,  the question of injustices, injustice in this world, and especially the ultimate injustice of radical  and cosmic nothingness and forgottenness, makes every single thing meaningless, everything pointless,  everything vanity, but in this text we also have, and we're going to be looking at this more in the  next three weeks, in this text we also have the clues to two, the two biblical answers, to this question  of injustice, now what I mean by that is, the Bible says don't tune out injustice but don't go into  despair, there's a third way, don't tune out injustice but don't go into despair, there's a third way,  you may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger brother,  in fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who try to  earn his love by being good, in his book the prodigal god Tim Keller shows how this well-known story  reveals the heart of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother  and the judgmental older brother, and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal  extravagant grace, whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith, the prodigal god will  help you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way, the prodigal god is our thank you for  your gift this month to help gospel and life share the hope and joy of Christ's gracious and  relentless love with people all over the world. Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash  give, that's gospelandlife.com slash give. What is that third way? Over the years it seems like increasingly I've found that the  Bible's answer boils down to two and I'm going to call them a cool answer and a hot answer. One is an answer for the mind, that's the cool one and one is an answer for the heart, that's the  hot one, all by themselves they don't work but together they're remarkable and the Ecclesiastes  writer because he's Ecclesiastes because he's different than any other book in the Bible does not  tell you but clue you.

He does not let see the Ecclesiastes is not a lecture, it's a seminar. It's almost a bull session. He does, he goes you, he role plays, he pushes you with questions, he  gives you clues and here the clues to both the cool and the hot answer. I will be brief but here's  what I want to tell you, even though I'm going to be brief, when we go through the cool answer right  now I want you to be patient. If you are not suffering the cool answer is very interesting but if  you're suffering the cool answer is very inadequate.

Okay but you have to have them both. What's the  cool answer? Alright, the cool or the answer, actually it's not called cool, let's call it the  answer for the mind. He gets at that in verses three and four, in verse four he says something  terrible about dogs and my wife is a dog lover and I promised her that I would not, I would put  this into context, but in verse four he says it's better to be a live dog than a dead lion. Now when  you think of dogs you think of beagles and collies but when the ancient people thought of dogs they  did not because the ancient people, dogs were the lowest form of animal, dogs were the scavengers,  dogs were wild, dogs lived on garbage and dogs ate cadavers, I mean when Jezebel the great queen,  the evil queen Jezebel is thrown into the street back in the Old Testament, what happens?

The dogs come into her, you see because well because of course she deserves the dogs they say because  she is so evil and the dogs deserve her you see because they're so they're so low but the lion  out of the ancients the lion was the greatest noble beast just as we see him now and now listen  what is he saying in verse four astounding. In fact if it wasn't linked with verse five we would have  to back away what he says in verse four is fairly simple he says there it's better to be a  liar a murderer a scavenger and save your skin than be a noble person who dies it's not worth it  to live for anything anymore what he's really saying you say what is he saying yes he's saying  something so shocking and so vicious he says it no longer matters it's better to save your skin be  a liar and a murderer and a thief then it is to be a noble person and die for it and if you say he  is he saying that it's in verse five the word four you see the word four this is the reason four  and go down in there and he says because love or hate in the end they vanish and what he's saying  is something very very very up to date and the philosophers are saying it now and what is it what  they are saying is this if this life is all there is if when you die you're rot if we're just we  just accidentally evolved as the out of the collocation of accidental forces then there is no such  thing as they're right and wrong there can't be all moral distinctions are pointless why well  Alistair McIntyre great philosopher has done this very very well in a couple of his books he says  here's the reason why he says the there's no such thing as abstract goodness goodness is always  relative to purpose what if you somebody gave you a watch and you'd never seen a watch before in  your life this is McIntyre's illustration but somebody gave you a watch and you'd never seen  this watch watch before and somebody says is it good you'd say I don't know what is it for  there's no such thing as abstract goodness is it is the watch for hammering a nail it's bad  is the watch for you know you know what is the watch for until you know what something is for you  don't know what is good or bad things are only good or bad in relation to the purpose what makes a  good human being McIntyre says if we're accidents if there's no purpose then it's  ridiculous to say it's bad to hurt people you're just here to survive the strong eat the  weak you're just here to survive better to be a live dog better to trample on people I mean  what how dare you say who who are you to say there's no warrant to say that anything is good or bad  if this life as all there is there is no good or bad but now here's the other part of this weird  argument in verse three in spite of the fact that he says vanity meaningless it's all meaningless  it's all meaningless up in verse three he says but men are evil and this is the problem  Derek Kiddner one of my favorite commentators on this verse Derek Kiddner says something  extremely interesting he says what we may not notice about verse three at first is that this  sense of outrage is just as much a fact about us as is our mortality the fascination of this  book of Ecclesiastes throughout its length arises largely from the collisions of observation and  equally obstinate and opposed intuitions so it pushes us toward a synthesis that is largely  beyond its own pages is what he means if you don't believe if you believe this life is all there is  then there's no such thing as injustice right and yet deep inside you know there is  on the one hand he says vanity meaningless pointless but then he also says and yet it's still as  evil and there is an incredible contradiction in the heart of being a secular person at the heart  of unbelief says this I don't believe really in a God because of the injustice but if there is no  God there's no basis for being outraged put it I'll go put it to you two ways it'll be on tape so  you can always listen to it again if there's a God evil is a problem it's a big problem he's got  reasons for why he's allowing it and we don't know what they are but that's not that really hurts  it still doesn't really make it better if there's a God evil is a problem but if even if evil is a  problem for you there must be a God you see that if evil is a problem if you are outraged and yet  your own worldview gives you no basis for the outrage what it means is your worldview is wrong  if you know there's an injustice even though if there is no God there shouldn't be an injustice then  you know there's a God put it another way it's a problem for belief evil is a problem for belief but  it's a bigger problem for unbelief it's what it's a problem if you believe in God but it's a  bigger problem if you don't believe in God because if you don't believe in God then the main  the original reason for disbelieving in God is gone you can't even define injustice there's no basis  for it that's the cool argument it's a very strong argument it's being made by Christian  philosophers all the time and that is evil is a problem for belief but it's a bigger problem for  unbelief and that's your only two alternatives so why not believe you have no basis for outrage no  basis for against injustice unless there is a just judge we don't know why he's not acting but if  you get rid of him out of your mental furniture you got a bigger problem than if you keep him now  didn't I warn you if you're not suffering if you're kind of intellectual type and there's lots of  you out there like that I know that's intriguing that's interesting you never thought of that that's  helpful maybe even but if you're suffering right now it's just cold it's cold comfort there's a  place in C. S. Lewis's book a grief observed where he says the thing I'm afraid of and when his  wife died Joy Davidman Gresham who went to Hunter College by the way when his wife died he says  the thing I'm not so much afraid of is that there is no God I'm afraid of who he might be  I'm afraid of meeting a God that I don't like Christianity doesn't just give you one  one answer the one answer is there we just gave it to you lots of religions have it there is a  God if there is no God you have a bigger problem with evil than if you don't have a God but Christianity  gives you another one it's the hot answer it's the personal answer it's the answer for the heart  and what is it well the clues for you're in this last little vignette what a weird story  when he says I saw one more thing and it impressed me in Hebrew that's that's a two-week  a word the word impress means it amazed me it confounded me it mystified me I don't know what it  means and here's why he saw a kind of wisdom in this little story this little thing he saw I saw  kind of wisdom beyond any wisdom he knew there was once a small city with only a few people in it  and a powerful king came against it surrounded it and built huge seed works against it  and now they lived in that city a man poor but wise he saved the city by his wisdom but nobody  remembered that poor man but the poor man's wisdom was despised there's three things about this  wisdom he'd never seen before first of all it was a saving wisdom look at a little city few people  versus a great king huge seed works it was absolutely overwhelming the city was absolutely doomed  there was no way out we don't know exactly how he did it but there was a wisdom that was so  incredibly powerful that it was able to save that city that's incredible but that's not all  more than that secondly it wasn't just a saving wisdom it was a serving wisdom one of the things  that is so weird and so unusual about this at least in the Old Testament is the wise man is poor  now you know the Ecclesiastes is a wise man and if you read the whole book you'll see he's a king  you'll see that he's rich because frankly if you're really wise if you're really smart  of course you're gonna get up in the world of course you're gonna make some money of course  you're gonna get ahead how could a wise man be poor but suddenly he's confronted with the fact  that this wisest of men this person with with with a most a supernatural saving wisdom  has not used his wisdom to dominate or get up but to be a servant he's used it in a humble way  and then lastly the most astounding thing of all anybody who has that kind of power and wisdom  and that kind of form of serving serving hood and wisdom he was not just forgotten look  he says nobody remembered him but he says he was despised it was a vicious it was a deliberate  forgetting the people turned on him they hated him now my friend Sinclair Ferguson wrote a book  on Ecclesiastes some years ago he called it pundits folly because he uses the term pundit  for the Ecclesiastes and this is what he says  he says God has pointed had placed testimonies to his presence throughout our lives there is no safe  haven there's no place we can escape his reality and the words of Ecclesiastes 9 13 to 16 read almost  like a prophecy whose name most naturally comes to mind when we hear of a poor man full of wisdom  who became a savior but whose life and teaching were rejected the man the pundit saw was just a  reflection of a wisdom beyond philosophical arguments wisdom himself the true poor wise man  who had become the savior as Paul describes him Christ crucified was a stumbling block to Jews  and foolishness to Greeks but to those whom Jesus who Christ is called both Jew and Greek  Christ the wisdom of God and the power of God now here's why this is the this is the hot answer  and this is a clue the Ecclesiastes writer sees a kind of wisdom and he's moved by it and we know why  because it's just an echo a pattern of the great wisdom and this is this we do not just have a  God who's simply up in heaven and he says I've got reasons why I'm not dealing with evil you're  just going to have to accept them they're and that and that's all you've got that's all you've got  you're in more shape if you reject me so there you are you're stuck with me tough  is that what God says not the Christian God the Christian God has done something unbelievable  here's the gospel we've forgotten God it is he who has made us but not and not we ourselves we've  forgotten him that means we go our own way we we doff our hats to him but in general every day  we don't remember him we forget him we act as if we're our own gods and because we have turned  away from the only permanent thing we have stopped because we've become temporary because we've  turned away from the only thing that lasts forever we are going to be forgotten and we know it  and deep in our hearts we know it that Ecclesiastes writer and Buddha and all the great ones are trying  to push you to say look at it you know the worst thing in the world is to be forgotten  to have people forget you to have people forget who you are that people forget that you were coming  I mean even in the micro that's horrible but in the macro it's even worse and here we're told  we deeply inside know that what's coming is cosmic forgottenness cosmic nothingness and we can't  handle it but God has done something about it he sent his son into the world and on the cross he  did not give us a philosophical argument when he was on the cross which is the why is the wisdom  of God when he was on the cross he did not say let me explain to you why if unbelief has more  of a problem with suffering than belief no what he said is my god my god why have you forgotten me  what was happening on the cross was God was pouring out the for the cosmic forgottenness he was  turning his back on his son he was giving to him what we deserve and what we know is coming in  what what is making our lives meaningless even though it's only half conscious even though it's  unconscious he got forsaken by his friends forsaken by his enemies but even forsaken by the father  he got the cosmic forgottenness that the ecclesiastist writer says is coming to everybody you know  it's coming to everybody and it's makes your life meaningless but it went into the heart of Jesus  that poor man was forgotten so that you will not be why do you think God can say and I say  49 can a woman forget the baby that nurses had her breasts yay she may forget but I will not  forget you behold you are engraved on the palm of my hands how can he say he'll never forget you  he'll never ever ever forget you that you will be remembered in love forever and ever  how can you walk out of the world knowing that that cosmic forgottenness is not yours anymore  and therefore you can walk out in the world and truly finally enjoy what's there because the  your forgottenness was put on Jesus and therefore the Christian can sing and though I am despised for  God yet God my God forgets me not and he is safe and must succeed for who Christ promises to plead  if you are not a believer today but you're a surcher I beg you you've got a hot and a cold answer  you not only have to think it out but you have to get to know this one this person a God who came  into suffering and received the suffering and injustice of this world in a more deep way than  anybody else has ever experienced it if you're a Christian let me tell you what your problem is  today you know what your problem is I'll tell you what it is you've forgotten the poor man  some of you are here today and you're upset you know what you've forgotten the one  who died for you though you forgot him bless the Lord of my soul says the Psalmist and all that is  within me bless his holy name bless the Lord of my soul and forget not his benefits the Psalmist  gets up every day and says my big problem is I've forgotten what he's done for me I've forgotten  the forgottenness that he took upon me if you're here today for example and you feel rejected by  somebody and you're in despair you've forgotten the fact that the only person whose opinion counts  the only one who's permanent the only one whose love will last forever loves you now because  your forgottenness was thrown on Jesus if you're a Christian today your whole problem is your  main problem is you've forgotten the poor man you've despised him you need to fill your heart  again with the knowledge of what he did for you don't you see this remember the poor man  and you'll live forever remember the poor man and you'll be loved forever let's pray we thank you  Lord God that because of who you made your son the son of God who loved you forever and knew  you forever and then what you did to him you poured out our forgottenness on him because of that  we can know that you will never forget us Lord when it comes down to it  philosophy can bring us to the brink can even give us some intellectual answers but it's only  a knowledge of your son that can help us to move out into the world and deal with the suffering  in a way that is neither tuning it out nor falling into despair oh we thank you that only at the cross  do we get to the place do we get the resources for dealing with the injustice of life  we pray Lord that those of us who are experiencing injustice now would know what your son  experienced for us that we can forgive and we can be strong and I pray for those here who don't  know who he is yet that through the despair that they might be feeling which is really a gift  of your Holy Spirit they may come to see who he is and what he's done for them I pray this in  Jesus name amen

### 中文翻译

### 引言：寻找意义

你是否曾问过自己，如果我所做的一切都不会长久，这就是全部吗？在今天的播客中，Tim Keller 探讨了传道书如何帮助我们面对疑惑、恐惧和不确定性，并指引我们在基督里找到持久的希望和意义。

让我们来看看这段经文。现在，我们即将阅读传道书，去年秋天，我讲了一次关于传道书的讲道，从那时起我就想回到这里。在九月份，我们将探讨这本书的一些基本主题。

一开始，当我们阅读它时，你会发现它与其他圣经书籍不同，这会立刻引起你的注意。我们将阅读传道书第九章，第二到十六节。

> “所有人都有共同的命运，义人和恶人，善良和邪恶，洁净和不洁净，献祭的人和不献祭的人，正如善良的人一样，罪人也是如此，正如那些发誓的人一样，那些害怕发誓的人也是如此。”

**这是在日光之下发生的一切邪恶。相同的命运降临到所有人身上。**

### 传道书及其独特视角

在过去的几十年里，至少在美国，甚至可能在整个西方，人们从未如此努力地寻找精神上的答案。而没有比传道书更好的地方去进行这种精神探索了。

传道书这个词是希伯来文作者的拉丁翻译。希伯来文中，作者称自己为“传道者”，这实际上意味着一个公共教师或评论员。有些人甚至称他为评论员，一个评论事物现状的人。

如果你或你认识的人正在进行精神探索，试图找到信仰或试图找到上帝或试图找到外面的东西，没有比传道书更好的地方了，因为在整本圣经中，这是唯一一本从怀疑者的角度写的书。

### 不公义的问题

你如何处理我在世界上看到的不公义、邪恶和痛苦？你不能生活而不问这些问题或基本上回答它们，即使你不认为你在回答它们，你也在回答它们。

**他拒绝让你回避不公义的问题，然后他给了我们两个答案的线索。**

首先，让我给你看，他如何确保你不回避这个问题。这很容易被忽视。在第十一和十二节中，首先，他在谈论生活中随机的一般不公。

> “比赛不一定是最快的赢，战斗不一定是最强的赢，食物不一定是聪明的人得到，财富不一定是聪明的人得到，恩惠不一定是有学问的人得到，但时间和机会降临到所有人身上。”

### 冷静与热情的答案

那第三种方式是什么？多年来，我发现圣经的答案似乎归结为两种，我将它们称为冷静的答案和热情的答案。一个是给头脑的答案，那是冷静的，一个是给心灵的答案，那是热情的。

**单独来看，它们不起作用，但结合在一起，它们是非凡的。**

传道书的作者因为他是传道书，因为他与圣经中的其他书不同，他不会直接告诉你，而是给你线索。他不会让你看到传道书不是一场讲座，而是一场研讨会。

### 结论：记住那位贫穷的人

传道书的作者看到了一种智慧，他被它感动，我们知道为什么，因为这只是伟大智慧的回声和模式，这就是我们不仅仅有一个简单在天堂的上帝，他说我有理由不处理邪恶，你只需要接受它们。

**基督教的上帝做了一件不可思议的事情。**

这是福音：我们忘记了上帝，是他创造了我们，而不是我们自己，我们忘记了他，这意味着我们走自己的路，我们向他致敬，但通常每天我们不记得他，我们忘记他，我们表现得好像我们是自己的神。

让我们祷告，我们感谢你，主上帝，因为你创造了你的儿子，永远爱你并认识你的上帝之子，然后你对他所做的，你把我们的遗忘倾倒在他身上，因为这样，我们可以知道你永远不会忘记我们。

## Chinese Transcript / 中文

在今天的播客中，提姆·凯勒要带我们来看《传道书》，看看这卷书如何帮助我们面对心中的怀疑、恐惧和不确定，并且把我们带向在基督里那永恒的盼望和真正的意义。我们先来读一段经文。

现在我们要读的是《传道书》。去年秋天，我讲过一篇关于《传道书》的讲道，从那以后我就一直想再回来讲这卷书。九月份，我们会一连几周来思想这本书的一些基本主题。你会马上发现，这卷书跟圣经里其它书非常不一样，这一点一读就能感觉出来。

《传道书》第九章，我们要读第 2–16 节：

“凡临到众人的事都是一样，就是义人和恶人，好人和坏人，洁净的和不洁净的，献祭的和不献祭的，好人如何，罪人也如何；起誓的怎样，怕起誓的也怎样。凡活着的人都知道必死；死了的人毫无所知，也不再得赏赐，他们的名无人记念。他们的爱，他们的恨，他们的嫉妒早都消灭了，在日光之下所行的一切事上，他们永不再有分。…凡你手所当做的事，要尽力去做，因为在你所必去的阴间，没有工作，没有谋算，没有知识，也没有智慧。…我又转念，见日光之下快跑的未必能赢，力战的未必得胜，智慧的未必得粮食，明哲的未必得资财，灵巧的未必得喜悦，所临到众人的，是在乎当时的机会。原来人也不知道自己的定期；鱼被恶网圈住，鸟被网罗捉住，祸患忽然临到的时候，世人陷在其中也是如此。…我见日光之下有一样智慧，据我看乃是广大，就是有一小城，其中的人数稀少，有大君王来攻击，修筑营垒，将城围困。城中有一个贫穷的智慧人，他用智慧救了那城，却没有人记念那穷人。于是我说：‘智慧胜过勇力，然而那贫穷人的智慧被人藐视，他的话也无人听从。’”

这是神的话。这是神的话。

在过去几十年里，至少在美国、甚至整个西方世界，从来没有像现在这样，多数人都在进行所谓“属灵探索”。而要进行属灵探索，没有比《传道书》更好的地方了。

“传道书”这个词，是希伯来原文作者称呼自己的一个词的拉丁文翻译。希伯来文叫“传道者”（coheleth），意思很难精确翻出来，大致是“公共教师”“评论者”。有人甚至直接把他叫做“时评员”“专栏作家”，一个对世界现状发表评论的人。

如果你自己，或者你认识的人，正在寻找信仰、寻找上帝、寻找“外面还有什么”，《传道书》是圣经中最合适的一卷。因为在整本圣经里，这大概是唯一一本从一个怀疑者的立场写出来的书——站在一个不信神、一个“实用世俗主义者”的角度来写的。

让我稍微解释一下。如果你不明白这一点，这卷书读起来会非常困惑。比如，你看第 5 节：“死人毫无所知。”这难道是圣经关于死后世界的一贯教导吗？显然不是。那这句话在这里做什么呢？

关键就在于一个短语——“在日光之下”。它在本段经文里反复出现，在整卷《传道书》中出现了几十次，却几乎不出现在圣经其它书卷，也几乎看不到有别的文学作品这样用。

“在日光之下”是什么意思？作者并不是在说：“事情就是如此如此，这是客观事实。”他是在说：“在日光之下看，好像是这样；在日光之下，这个是事实。”他说：“这生命是虚空的。”什么叫“虚空”？意思是：当你只从“日光之下”的角度看人生——也就是只从今生、完全不考虑“日光之上”的永恒、不考虑天上的现实——如果你假设“这一生就是全部”，那么在这样的前提下，人生就是虚空的，这就是“日光之下”的意思。

这位作者特别有帮助的地方在于，他所采取的立场，不是那种抽象的哲学无神论，而更像是当今纽约普通人、乃至整个西方社会普通人的“实用世俗主义”。

什么叫“实用世俗主义”？你会发现，他也会偶尔提到“神”这个词，他也会说“神赐给我们这虚空的人生”。但你在书里看到的“神”，并不是那位圣经的上帝——不是天地的审判者，不是灵魂的爱人。如果你问纽约街头的普通人：“你信上帝吗？”真正那种严格意义上的“哲学无神论者”其实非常少。大多数人会说：“也许有一种至高存在吧，但我们不可能真正知道祂是谁，也不可能知道祂的旨意。”

所以，实用世俗主义的想法就是：这辈子就是全部，我们不知道自己为什么在这儿，人死了也就算了。因此你只能尽量在这一生里“过得好一点”。《传道书》的作者就采用了这样的视角：好，我们就假设你是一个实用世俗主义者，我们来看看站在这一立场上，人生真正是什么样子。

然后他在书中就着人必须面对的三个“人生大工程”展开讨论——接下来这几周我们也会分别讲到这三件事。他说：每一个人都逃不开这三件事——不管你有没有意识到，你都在为此做出选择。哪三件？

第一是“公义”：我要如何面对世界上的不公、邪恶和苦难？
第二是“享乐”：我在哪里可以找到真正的快乐？什么会真正满足我？
第三是“成就”：我这一生要用来做什么？什么值得我用一生去投入？

你不可能完全绕开这几个问题——就算你以为自己没有回答，其实你已经在用自己的方式回答了。《传道书》说：好，我们就从这些问题下手。这也是为什么这本书如此独特、如此有帮助，为什么它最终会把你带到上帝面前。

这本书不只是简单地说：“有怀疑，也有信仰。”它更特别的地方在于——它不仅仅怀疑信仰，也怀疑“不信”。它不只是对“信的人”提问题，它也对“怀疑的人”的怀疑提出怀疑。

这点在今天非常罕见。我们这个时代好像只会质疑信仰，却从不质疑怀疑。本书却在说：如果你要对信仰提出尖锐问题，那你也应该对自己的怀疑同样提出尖锐问题。你每次怀疑的时候，其实也是站在某个立场上怀疑；你不可能凭空怀疑，而不用某个世界观作为立足点。实用世俗主义的立场就是：“这一生是全部。”作者说：好，我们就站在这个立场，来问几个问题。第一个问题就是：既然如此，你要怎么处理“公义与不公”的问题？

对你们当中的一些人而言，这就是你灵命上的核心难题——你信仰上最大的绊脚石，就是你亲眼见过、乃至亲身经历过的那些苦难与不公。对另一些人来说，也许这不是唯一的大问题（接下来几周我们会谈别的问题），但它仍然至关重要：你要如何面对世界的不公？

这位作者在这里做了三件事，我只能大致勾勒一下。首先，他拒绝让你逃避这个问题；其次，他给了我们两个答案的线索。

第一，他不让你逃避。你很容易把这个问题“调静音”。在第 11–12 节，他先谈的是世上那种“随机发生的一般性不公”。他说什么呢？他说：“快跑的未必能赢，力战的未必得胜；有智慧的不一定吃得饱，有聪明的未必致富，有技能的人也未必得人喜爱；时间和机遇临到众人。人也不知道自己的定期，好像鱼被恶网圈住，鸟被网罗捉住，祸患忽然临到的时候，人被陷在其中。”

我为这篇讲道做预备时，读到一位作者的例子：他某一晚观看电视新闻，就把每条新闻的头一句记下来，结果是这样的：

“今晚中东地区再度爆发冲突。三名恐怖分子劫持了一辆校车，引爆炸弹，炸死了自己，也炸死了车上的所有孩子。”

“一个强台风袭击孟加拉国，数千人溺亡，数万人无家可归。”

“高速公路上一起四车连环相撞，导致五人死亡。”

“在布朗克斯区，一名坐在母亲腿上的五岁女孩被流弹击中，当场身亡。”

“研究报告指出，第三世界数千名儿童每天死于本可预防的疾病，只因为那些拥有资源的人出于冷漠、自私与顽固的无知，没有采取行动。”

这说明了什么？这正是《传道书》作者要你看到的现实：不管你是谁，不管你在什么地方，不管你是好人还是坏人，可怕的事情都可能随时、随机地发生在你身上——没有明显的因果正义，完全显得荒谬。小孩子突然被炸死；某个人突然遭遇灾难。就像他所说的，那可能发生在任何人身上，随时都可能临到你。世界上到处都是随机的苦难与残酷，这就是人生的不公，这是他提到的第一点。

他说：“你看——赛跑的不一定得冠军；你也许很能跑，却依然会输。你也许很聪明，却未必成功。人生从根本上是一场‘掷骰子’。”如果你以为：“只要我做对 A、B、C 几件事，人生就一定会顺利。”那你还很年轻。年轻人常常用这种方式“屏蔽”人生的不公：那是“那些人”的事，不会发生在我身上；我要谨慎、要自律、要小心选择环境……作者却说：不，他不会就此打住。

接着，他继续往下走。他不只讲那些随机发生在许多人身上的一般性不公，他还讲到一个更深层、更彻底的不公——那就是每一个人最终都逃不掉的“终极不公”。

在第 3–4 节他说：“义人怎样，罪人也怎样；起誓的怎样，怕起誓的也怎样。这是在日光之下所行的一切事上所发生的恶。”往下看第 5 节：“活着的人知道必死；死了的人毫无所知，也不得再赏赐，他们的名无人记念。”

他不是只在说：“好人受苦、坏人享福，这是一种不公。”那当然也是不公，但还只是“随机事件”。他要说的是更深的：无论你这一生如何生活——哪怕是如第 6 节所说，你活在爱中，或是活在恨中；不论你是恐怖分子还是那个无辜的孩子——你所做的一切终将归于虚无。更糟的是，不但你做过的事最终会消失，就连你留下的影响、你被别人记住的那些东西，也会被彻底遗忘。

如果“这一生就是全部”，那么在每一个人的人生尽头，都有一个虚无在等着你。只要你愿意稍微认真想一想——作者说，他现在就是逼你去想——你就会发现，这样的结局让你这一生所做的一切都变得毫无意义。

不久前我和凯西一起看了一部约翰·塞尔斯的电影《持枪之人》（Men with Guns），是一部很有力量的作品。故事讲的是在某个拉丁美洲国家，有一位医生，训练了一群年轻医生，把他们派到偏远贫穷的山村去，为那些极度需要的人提供医疗。后来他发现，那些被他训练出来、派去服事的人几乎全部被军队或游击队杀害了，也就是说，他所做的一切、他们所献上的一切生命，都在很短时间内被彻底毁掉。

整部电影讲的，就是这位老人家不断冒险进入极其危险的地区，试图找到他曾经训练过的那些年轻人，但他始终找不到。到了最后，他自己也死了，他临终前最后一句话是：“人活着应该留下点什么。”在某个片段，他说：“我不是宗教人士，我是科学家、医生。但我需要知道，我曾经做过什么，使这个世界变得更好一点。我必须知道这一点，否则我的人生就完全没有意义。”

《传道书》的作者在旁边好像在喊：“醒一醒！”就算那些年轻人没有死，情况又怎么样呢？即便你盖了金字塔，你可能会被记得久一点，但最终，若是你死了就腐烂、太阳也死去、万物都腐朽，那么宇宙性遗忘就在每个人生命的终点在等着他。不管你做过什么，不管你是谁，结局都一样——这就让你所做的一切都变得毫无意义、完全虚空。

有人会说：“我知道你要说什么了。我上哲学导论课的时候听过类似的话。这个作者不过是太悲观、太消极罢了。”如果你是一个实用世俗主义者，你也许会说：“对，照这样想下去，你当然会一直忧郁。但算了吧，世上还有中央公园、还有剧院、还有性、还有美食、还有漂亮衣服……”

作者早就听过这种反应，一百遍都听过。在第 7 节你就看到，他顺着你的话说下去。他说：“好，好，我们就按你说的来。”

于是第 7 节说：“你只管去欢欢喜喜地吃你的饭，心中快乐地喝酒，因为神已经悦纳你的作为。你的衣服当时常洁白，你头上也不要缺少膏油。”换句话说，去尽情享受美食、派对、打扮得光鲜亮丽，感觉美妙极了；“在你虚空的人生中，享受你所爱的妻子”；换句话说，尽情享受婚姻中的性爱吧，“因为这是你在日光之下劳碌之事上所得的分。”他说：“反正人生终究是虚空，这种虚空感迟早会突破出来。但你还是可以先去吃喝快乐。”

他其实是在说：“你别想就这么把问题敷衍过去。”真正伟大的思想家都不会让你这样逃避问题。释迦牟尼在成佛之前还是悉达多太子的时候，传说他一直被养在王宫里，看不到任何痛苦。直到有一天，他第一次看到一个老人；第二天，他看到一个病人；第三天，他看到一具尸体。他意识到，这一切迟早都会发生在每一个人身上。传说他曾对车夫说：“在人生这样的光景面前，人要能保持镇定，心肠必须多么刚硬啊！”他开始痛哭，说：“衰老——”车夫说：“当然会衰老啊，人人都知道，迟早你会失去容貌、记忆、感觉……人人都明白。”但佛陀说：“既然你们知道这些，为什么你们没有痛哭？为什么你们不去挣扎？这难道不会让一切都变得毫无意义吗？我们必须做点什么，必须认真面对它。”

所有真正伟大的人都这样——他们拒绝让你把这些问题静音。《传道书》的作者也说：“你不要这样做。如果你想放弃仅有的人性，那就继续把这些问题关掉吧。”

所以，他拒绝让你从这个问题底下溜走——世界的不公，尤其是那种终极的不公：宇宙性的虚无与遗忘，使人所做的一切都变得虚空、毫无意义、尽是“捕风”。

但在这段经文里，我们也看到了两个圣经式答案的线索。圣经的立场既不是“逃避不公”，也不是“陷入绝望”，而是第三条道路：既不逃避不公，也不绝望。

你们大概都知道“浪子回头”的故事，但那不是只讲一个迷途小儿的故事。耶稣讲这个比喻，是为了同时对两种人说话：一类是逃离上帝的小儿子，一类是靠“做好人”来赚取上帝喜爱的长子。凯勒在他的书《浪子神》（The Prodigal God）里指出，这个故事揭示了福音的核心——既是对小儿子的盼望，也是对大儿子的提醒，更是邀请所有人来经历神“浪费式”的恩典。

无论你是基督徒，还是仍在探索信仰，《浪子神》都会帮助你以全新的方式来看你与基督的关系。这本书也是我们这个月为支持“福音与生活”事工而预备的回馈礼物，盼望借着你的奉献，让更多人听见基督慷慨、坚韧不拔的爱。

那第三条路到底是什么呢？这些年我越来越觉得，圣经的答案大致可以归纳成两方面：一个是“冷的答案”，一个是“热的答案”。一个是给头脑的，一个是给心的。单独拿任何一边都不够，两者合在一起却非常有力量。《传道书》的作者因为这本书的特殊风格，不是直接把答案讲透，而是给你线索、给你提示，逼你自己去想。

所谓“给头脑的冷答案”，就是一种理性的、哲学性的回答。他在第 3–4 节开始切入这个问题。他在第 4 节说了一句关于“狗”的话，听起来相当惊人——我妻子非常爱狗，我答应过她要把这句话放在适当的语境里来解释。他说：“活着的狗比死了的狮子更好。”

当你想到“狗”，你可能想到的是可爱的宠物、牧羊犬、柯利犬；但在古代世界，狗是一种最卑贱的动物，是吃垃圾的野狗，是啃尸体的。旧约中邪恶的王后耶洗别被丢在街上，结果怎么样？狗来把她吃掉。人们会说：“这再合适不过了，她那么邪恶，配得这样的下场；而且这些狗也低贱到配吃她。”

相对地，狮子在古人的眼中是最尊贵的猛兽，和我们今天的印象差不多。所以，作者在第 4 节说“活着的狗比死了的狮子更好”，这话有多震撼，可想而知。如果不和第 5 节连在一起，你几乎都不敢说出口。

他的意思其实相当激烈：与其做一个为正义而死的高贵之人，不如做一个活着的卑贱之徒——只要能保住性命，就算撒谎、杀人、欺骗都没关系。为任何“崇高价值”而死都不值得。换句话说，在一个只剩今生的世界里，“活着”就是唯一的价值。这话听起来是不是很刺耳？

你会说：“他真的在说这个吗？”是的，你往下看第 5 节，因为那里有一个“因为”（for），他说明原因：“因为爱也好，恨也好，嫉妒也好，到头来都消失了。”这正是许多现代哲学家在说的：如果只有这一生，如果人死了就什么都没有，如果我们只是物质偶然碰撞演化出来的产物，那么所谓“对错善恶”就没有客观意义，一切道德分辨都失去根基。

阿拉斯代尔·麦金太尔这位哲学家在书中用过一个比喻：如果有人第一次见到手表，从没见过这种东西，就拿到手里问：“这个东西好不好？”你怎么回答？你一定会先问：“它是用来做什么的？”如果它是用来钉钉子，那它是个糟糕的工具；如果它是用来看时间，那就要看它准不准确。也就是说，没有一种抽象的“好坏”，所有“好坏”都必须相对于“目的”来判断。

那什么叫“好的人生”呢？如果人只是偶然出现，没有被创造、没有目的，那你凭什么说“伤害别人是不好的”？在一个弱肉强食、适者生存的世界里，多活下来、多压倒别人，反而才是“合理”。于是，“活着的狗比死了的狮子更好”就变成了唯一的逻辑。你又凭什么说这样“不好”？你没有立足点来做这种道德判断。

可是，在第 3 节，他又说：“人的心充满恶。”也就是说，一方面他说“一切都是虚空”，价值和意义都被抽空了；另一方面，他又说“人的恶是一个问题”。

旧约学者德里克·基德纳在注释这节经文时说：我们也许一开始没有注意到，第 3 节里那种“愤慨感”本身，跟我们的必死性一样，都是“关于人类的事实”。我们深深知道有些事情“不对劲”，这种“道德愤怒感”本身就是我们人性的一部分。《传道书》整卷书的张力，就在于观察到的事实，与我们内心执拗地坚持的直觉之间不断碰撞，把我们推向一种超出本书字面范畴以外的综合结论。

如果你相信“这一生就是全部”，那么严格来讲就没有所谓“不公不义”；然而你内心深处却又知道，某些事情的确是恶的、是不公的。一方面你说“一切都是虚空”，另一方面你又忍不住说：“这太不公平了，这太错了。”这种矛盾正是世俗不信世界观内在的撕裂。

换一个方式说：如果有神，苦难与邪恶当然是个难题，是信仰必须面对的难关——你会问：神为什么不阻止？为什么允许这些事发生？我们也许不知道答案。但如果没有神，苦难反而成了更大的问题——因为你连“邪恶”和“不公”这两个词都失去客观意义，你没有基点来对世界说：“这不对。”

如果你说：“我之所以不相信有神，就是因为世界上有这么多恶。”那你要问问自己：你凭什么这么强烈地觉得这些事“就是不对”？你的世界观其实没有给你这种“道德愤慨”的基础。换句话说：邪恶固然是信仰的难题，但它更是“无神论”的致命难题。如果邪恶真的让你痛心，那你的心里已经在承认某种“超越”的标准，你其实已经在假定有一位公义的裁判者存在。

这就是所谓“给头脑的冷答案”。很多基督徒哲学家都在论证这一点：邪恶当然给信仰带来困难，但拒绝神并不能解决问题，只会让问题更大。你只有两个选项：要么你承认有一位神，同时老实面对“为什么祂允许这些事”的张力；要么你否认有神，却发现自己连“这不公平”都说不出口。

不过我刚才已经提醒过你了：如果你现在没有在受苦，这个“冷答案”会显得很有趣、很有启发性；但如果你正处在巨大痛苦中，这个答案听起来就很冰冷、几乎没有安慰。你需要的不只是逻辑，还有一位可以拥抱的神。

C.S.路易斯在《卑微的哀恸》（A Grief Observed）里，在妻子去世之后写道：他现在最害怕的，并不是“没有神”，而是“如果有一位神，我怕他是什么样的人”。换言之，他害怕遇见的是一个自己不喜欢的神。

基督信仰并不只有“冷答案”。那只是其中一半，很多宗教也有类似的思路。基督信仰还有另一半——一个“热答案”，一个给心的答案，一个关系性的答案。

这个“热答案”的线索，就藏在本章结尾那个看似奇怪的小故事里。作者说：“我又见日光之下有一种智慧，在我看来甚为重大。”原文“甚为重大”有“极其惊讶、困惑”的意思。他看见了一种前所未见的智慧，让他震撼、叫他摸不着头脑。

故事是这样：有一座小城，城里的人不多。有一位大君王率军前来攻城，筑起高大的围城工事，把这座小城团团围住。照理说，这城必败无疑，毫无希望。然而城里有一个贫穷但有智慧的人，用他的智慧拯救了这座城——圣经没有告诉我们他具体怎么做，但结果是整座城得救了。

这是第一点：这是一个“拯救的智慧”，它的能力大到足以救出一座注定要灭亡的城市。

第二点，更奇怪的是：这是一个“服事的智慧”。在旧约里，“智慧人”通常不会是穷人。如果你读整本《传道书》，会发现作者自己就是那位“传道者”，他是一位王，是富有的人。照常理说，一个真正有智慧、有能力的人，必然会在社会上往上爬，会挣到钱，会有地位。那一个真正“智慧的人”怎么会是穷人呢？

这里作者突然看见一个从未见过的景象：一个真正有超自然智慧、能拯救众人的人，却没有用他的智慧谋取权力和地位，而是选择卑微地服事别人。

第三点，更惊人的是：这样一位拯救者，最后却被人彻底遗忘，甚至遭人藐视。经文说：“却没有人记念那穷人……那贫穷人的智慧被人藐视，他的话也无人听从。”这不是一般的“时间久了大家淡忘”，而是一种带着敌意的遗忘——人们选择背弃这位拯救他们的人。

我有个朋友辛克莱·弗格森曾经写过一本关于《传道书》的书，书名就叫《评论员的愚昧》（Pundit’s Folly），因为他把《传道书》的作者叫做“评论员”。他在书里说，上帝在我们生命里到处摆下见证，让我们无处可逃。你无论往哪里跑，总会撞见一些“预表”，一些指向他的影子。他说，当你读到 9 章 13–16 节的时候，很难不想到有一位“贫穷却有智慧的人”，他成了救主，却被自己的百姓拒绝——你脑中最自然浮现的名字是谁？

那位“评论员”在异象里看到的人，只是那位更大智慧者的影子，是“智慧本身”的一个剪影。正如保罗所说，“基督钉十字架，在犹太人是绊脚石，在外邦人是愚拙；但在蒙召的人，却是神的能力、神的智慧。”

这就是“热答案”的线索：我们面对的不是一位远在天边、冷冷地说“我有充分理由允许这些事发生，你们只能接受”的神。他不是说：“如果你拒绝我，只会更糟，所以你最好安分点。”基督教的神做了一件不可思议的事。

福音是什么？福音是：我们忘记了神——“是他造了我们，我们本是属他的”，但我们却忘了他。我们每天过日子，好像自己才是神。于是，我们从那位唯一永恒者那里转身，投向一切暂时的东西，结果自己也成了迟早被遗忘的存在。

《传道书》的作者、佛陀以及许多伟大的思想家都在推你面对这一点：人生最可怕的事，就是被遗忘——被人忘记你是谁，被人忘记你曾经存在。哪怕在很小的层面，被人遗忘也是极大的痛；在宇宙尺度上，那就更恐怖了。我们内心深处隐约知道，前面等着我们的，是一种宇宙性的遗忘与虚无，而我们无法承受。

但神为此做了什么呢？祂差自己的儿子进入世界。十字架是神的智慧——但当耶稣挂在十字架上的时候，他没有给我们上一堂哲学课，没有说：“让我解释给你们听，为什么不信神的人面对苦难的问题比信神的人更难解。”他只说了一句：“我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？”

在十字架上，发生的事就是：父神把本该落在我们身上的“宇宙性遗忘”倾倒在祂身上，转过脸去不再看祂，把本该属于我们的结局加在祂身上。耶稣被朋友离弃，被敌人弃绝，甚至被父神撇下。他经历了作者所说的那种“终极的被遗忘”，好让我们不再被遗忘。

这就是为什么神能在《以赛亚书》 49 章说：“妇人焉能忘记她吃奶的婴孩，不怜恤她所生的儿子？即或有忘记的，我却不忘记你。看哪，我将你铭刻在我掌上。”神为什么能说，祂永不忘记你？因为你该受的那种“被忘记”，已经落在耶稣身上。

如果你是基督徒，你可以坦然地走进这个世界，知道宇宙性遗忘再也不属于你——你被永远记念、被永远爱着。你因此能真正享受世界上那些美好的事物，而不用害怕它们有一天全部失去，因为你最深的安全感已经安放在基督身上了。基督徒因此可以唱：“纵然世人轻看我，我的神却不忘记我；祂既为我代求，我就必得保守。”

如果你今天还不是基督徒，但你在寻找，你手上其实已经握有“冷答案”和“热答案”这两条线索。你不仅需要在理性上想清楚，也需要去认识这位神——一位亲自进入苦难、比任何人都更深地经历不公与痛苦的神。

如果你已经是基督徒，让我告诉你，你现在最大的属灵问题是什么。其实就是——你忘了那位“穷乏人”。你忘了那位为你死的救主。诗人说：“我的心哪，你要称颂耶和华，不可忘记他的一切恩惠。”诗人每天一醒来就提醒自己：我今天最大的危险，就是忘记神为我做的一切，忘记那位担当我“被遗忘”的主。

如果你今天正被人拒绝，以至于很痛苦、很绝望，那是因为你忘了：唯一真正重要的那一位——那位永恒的、他的爱永不止息的神——现在仍然爱你，因着耶稣，你在祂面前永远不会被遗忘。

如果你今天是基督徒，你所有的问题，从根本上说，都在于你忘记了那位“穷乏的智慧人”。你需要再次把心充满对他为你所做之事的记念。

记念这位“穷乏人”，你就必永远活着；记念这位“穷乏人”，你就必永远被爱。

让我们祷告：

主上帝，我们感谢你，因为你的儿子，从永恒里就爱你、认识你；而你却在十字架上，把我们该受的“被遗忘”都倾倒在他身上。因为这件事，我们可以知道，你永不会忘记我们。

主啊，哲学可以把我们带到某个边缘，甚至给我们某些理性上的答案，但唯有认识你的儿子，才能让我们走进这个世界，在苦难中不致麻木、也不致绝望。我们感谢你，因为唯有在十字架前，我们才得到面对人生不公的真正资源。

我为那些正在经历不公、受伤害的人祷告，求你让他们在基督所受的苦难中，找到赦免与刚强；也为那些还不认识你的人祷告，求你借着他们心中的绝望——那其实是你圣灵的礼物——引导他们看见耶稣是谁，以及他为他们所成就的一切。

奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。

在今天的播客中，提姆·凯勒要带我们来看《传道书》，看看这卷书如何帮助我们面对心中的怀疑、恐惧和不确定，并且把我们带向在基督里那永恒的盼望和真正的意义。我们先来读一段经文。

现在我们要读的是《传道书》。去年秋天，我讲过一篇关于《传道书》的讲道，从那以后我就一直想再回来讲这卷书。九月份，我们会一连几周来思想这本书的一些基本主题。你会马上发现，这卷书跟圣经里其它书非常不一样，这一点一读就能感觉出来。

《传道书》第九章，我们要读第 2–16 节：

“凡临到众人的事都是一样，就是义人和恶人，好人和坏人，洁净的和不洁净的，献祭的和不献祭的，好人如何，罪人也如何；起誓的怎样，怕起誓的也怎样。凡活着的人都知道必死；死了的人毫无所知，也不再得赏赐，他们的名无人记念。他们的爱，他们的恨，他们的嫉妒早都消灭了，在日光之下所行的一切事上，他们永不再有分。…凡你手所当做的事，要尽力去做，因为在你所必去的阴间，没有工作，没有谋算，没有知识，也没有智慧。…我又转念，见日光之下快跑的未必能赢，力战的未必得胜，智慧的未必得粮食，明哲的未必得资财，灵巧的未必得喜悦，所临到众人的，是在乎当时的机会。原来人也不知道自己的定期；鱼被恶网圈住，鸟被网罗捉住，祸患忽然临到的时候，世人陷在其中也是如此。…我见日光之下有一样智慧，据我看乃是广大，就是有一小城，其中的人数稀少，有大君王来攻击，修筑营垒，将城围困。城中有一个贫穷的智慧人，他用智慧救了那城，却没有人记念那穷人。于是我说：‘智慧胜过勇力，然而那贫穷人的智慧被人藐视，他的话也无人听从。’”

这是神的话。这是神的话。

在过去几十年里，至少在美国、甚至整个西方世界，从来没有像现在这样，多数人都在进行所谓“属灵探索”。而要进行属灵探索，没有比《传道书》更好的地方了。

“传道书”这个词，是希伯来原文作者称呼自己的一个词的拉丁文翻译。希伯来文叫“传道者”（coheleth），意思很难精确翻出来，大致是“公共教师”“评论者”。有人甚至直接把他叫做“时评员”“专栏作家”，一个对世界现状发表评论的人。

如果你自己，或者你认识的人，正在寻找信仰、寻找上帝、寻找“外面还有什么”，《传道书》是圣经中最合适的一卷。因为在整本圣经里，这大概是唯一一本从一个怀疑者的立场写出来的书——站在一个不信神、一个“实用世俗主义者”的角度来写的。

让我稍微解释一下。如果你不明白这一点，这卷书读起来会非常困惑。比如，你看第 5 节：“死人毫无所知。”这难道是圣经关于死后世界的一贯教导吗？显然不是。那这句话在这里做什么呢？

关键就在于一个短语——“在日光之下”。它在本段经文里反复出现，在整卷《传道书》中出现了几十次，却几乎不出现在圣经其它书卷，也几乎看不到有别的文学作品这样用。

“在日光之下”是什么意思？作者并不是在说：“事情就是如此如此，这是客观事实。”他是在说：“在日光之下看，好像是这样；在日光之下，这个是事实。”他说：“这生命是虚空的。”什么叫“虚空”？意思是：当你只从“日光之下”的角度看人生——也就是只从今生、完全不考虑“日光之上”的永恒、不考虑天上的现实——如果你假设“这一生就是全部”，那么在这样的前提下，人生就是虚空的，这就是“日光之下”的意思。

这位作者特别有帮助的地方在于，他所采取的立场，不是那种抽象的哲学无神论，而更像是当今纽约普通人、乃至整个西方社会普通人的“实用世俗主义”。

什么叫“实用世俗主义”？你会发现，他也会偶尔提到“神”这个词，他也会说“神赐给我们这虚空的人生”。但你在书里看到的“神”，并不是那位圣经的上帝——不是天地的审判者，不是灵魂的爱人。如果你问纽约街头的普通人：“你信上帝吗？”真正那种严格意义上的“哲学无神论者”其实非常少。大多数人会说：“也许有一种至高存在吧，但我们不可能真正知道祂是谁，也不可能知道祂的旨意。”

所以，实用世俗主义的想法就是：这辈子就是全部，我们不知道自己为什么在这儿，人死了也就算了。因此你只能尽量在这一生里“过得好一点”。《传道书》的作者就采用了这样的视角：好，我们就假设你是一个实用世俗主义者，我们来看看站在这一立场上，人生真正是什么样子。

然后他在书中就着人必须面对的三个“人生大工程”展开讨论——接下来这几周我们也会分别讲到这三件事。他说：每一个人都逃不开这三件事——不管你有没有意识到，你都在为此做出选择。哪三件？

第一是“公义”：我要如何面对世界上的不公、邪恶和苦难？
第二是“享乐”：我在哪里可以找到真正的快乐？什么会真正满足我？
第三是“成就”：我这一生要用来做什么？什么值得我用一生去投入？

你不可能完全绕开这几个问题——就算你以为自己没有回答，其实你已经在用自己的方式回答了。《传道书》说：好，我们就从这些问题下手。这也是为什么这本书如此独特、如此有帮助，为什么它最终会把你带到上帝面前。

这本书不只是简单地说：“有怀疑，也有信仰。”它更特别的地方在于——它不仅仅怀疑信仰，也怀疑“不信”。它不只是对“信的人”提问题，它也对“怀疑的人”的怀疑提出怀疑。

这点在今天非常罕见。我们这个时代好像只会质疑信仰，却从不质疑怀疑。本书却在说：如果你要对信仰提出尖锐问题，那你也应该对自己的怀疑同样提出尖锐问题。你每次怀疑的时候，其实也是站在某个立场上怀疑；你不可能凭空怀疑，而不用某个世界观作为立足点。实用世俗主义的立场就是：“这一生是全部。”作者说：好，我们就站在这个立场，来问几个问题。第一个问题就是：既然如此，你要怎么处理“公义与不公”的问题？

对你们当中的一些人而言，这就是你灵命上的核心难题——你信仰上最大的绊脚石，就是你亲眼见过、乃至亲身经历过的那些苦难与不公。对另一些人来说，也许这不是唯一的大问题（接下来几周我们会谈别的问题），但它仍然至关重要：你要如何面对世界的不公？

这位作者在这里做了三件事，我只能大致勾勒一下。首先，他拒绝让你逃避这个问题；其次，他给了我们两个答案的线索。

第一，他不让你逃避。你很容易把这个问题“调静音”。在第 11–12 节，他先谈的是世上那种“随机发生的一般性不公”。他说什么呢？他说：“快跑的未必能赢，力战的未必得胜；有智慧的不一定吃得饱，有聪明的未必致富，有技能的人也未必得人喜爱；时间和机遇临到众人。人也不知道自己的定期，好像鱼被恶网圈住，鸟被网罗捉住，祸患忽然临到的时候，人被陷在其中。”

我为这篇讲道做预备时，读到一位作者的例子：他某一晚观看电视新闻，就把每条新闻的头一句记下来，结果是这样的：

“今晚中东地区再度爆发冲突。三名恐怖分子劫持了一辆校车，引爆炸弹，炸死了自己，也炸死了车上的所有孩子。”

“一个强台风袭击孟加拉国，数千人溺亡，数万人无家可归。”

“高速公路上一起四车连环相撞，导致五人死亡。”

“在布朗克斯区，一名坐在母亲腿上的五岁女孩被流弹击中，当场身亡。”

“研究报告指出，第三世界数千名儿童每天死于本可预防的疾病，只因为那些拥有资源的人出于冷漠、自私与顽固的无知，没有采取行动。”

这说明了什么？这正是《传道书》作者要你看到的现实：不管你是谁，不管你在什么地方，不管你是好人还是坏人，可怕的事情都可能随时、随机地发生在你身上——没有明显的因果正义，完全显得荒谬。小孩子突然被炸死；某个人突然遭遇灾难。就像他所说的，那可能发生在任何人身上，随时都可能临到你。世界上到处都是随机的苦难与残酷，这就是人生的不公，这是他提到的第一点。

他说：“你看——赛跑的不一定得冠军；你也许很能跑，却依然会输。你也许很聪明，却未必成功。人生从根本上是一场‘掷骰子’。”如果你以为：“只要我做对 A、B、C 几件事，人生就一定会顺利。”那你还很年轻。年轻人常常用这种方式“屏蔽”人生的不公：那是“那些人”的事，不会发生在我身上；我要谨慎、要自律、要小心选择环境……作者却说：不，他不会就此打住。

接着，他继续往下走。他不只讲那些随机发生在许多人身上的一般性不公，他还讲到一个更深层、更彻底的不公——那就是每一个人最终都逃不掉的“终极不公”。

在第 3–4 节他说：“义人怎样，罪人也怎样；起誓的怎样，怕起誓的也怎样。这是在日光之下所行的一切事上所发生的恶。”往下看第 5 节：“活着的人知道必死；死了的人毫无所知，也不得再赏赐，他们的名无人记念。”

他不是只在说：“好人受苦、坏人享福，这是一种不公。”那当然也是不公，但还只是“随机事件”。他要说的是更深的：无论你这一生如何生活——哪怕是如第 6 节所说，你活在爱中，或是活在恨中；不论你是恐怖分子还是那个无辜的孩子——你所做的一切终将归于虚无。更糟的是，不但你做过的事最终会消失，就连你留下的影响、你被别人记住的那些东西，也会被彻底遗忘。

如果“这一生就是全部”，那么在每一个人的人生尽头，都有一个虚无在等着你。只要你愿意稍微认真想一想——作者说，他现在就是逼你去想——你就会发现，这样的结局让你这一生所做的一切都变得毫无意义。

不久前我和凯西一起看了一部约翰·塞尔斯的电影《持枪之人》（Men with Guns），是一部很有力量的作品。故事讲的是在某个拉丁美洲国家，有一位医生，训练了一群年轻医生，把他们派到偏远贫穷的山村去，为那些极度需要的人提供医疗。后来他发现，那些被他训练出来、派去服事的人几乎全部被军队或游击队杀害了，也就是说，他所做的一切、他们所献上的一切生命，都在很短时间内被彻底毁掉。

整部电影讲的，就是这位老人家不断冒险进入极其危险的地区，试图找到他曾经训练过的那些年轻人，但他始终找不到。到了最后，他自己也死了，他临终前最后一句话是：“人活着应该留下点什么。”在某个片段，他说：“我不是宗教人士，我是科学家、医生。但我需要知道，我曾经做过什么，使这个世界变得更好一点。我必须知道这一点，否则我的人生就完全没有意义。”

《传道书》的作者在旁边好像在喊：“醒一醒！”就算那些年轻人没有死，情况又怎么样呢？即便你盖了金字塔，你可能会被记得久一点，但最终，若是你死了就腐烂、太阳也死去、万物都腐朽，那么宇宙性遗忘就在每个人生命的终点在等着他。不管你做过什么，不管你是谁，结局都一样——这就让你所做的一切都变得毫无意义、完全虚空。

有人会说：“我知道你要说什么了。我上哲学导论课的时候听过类似的话。这个作者不过是太悲观、太消极罢了。”如果你是一个实用世俗主义者，你也许会说：“对，照这样想下去，你当然会一直忧郁。但算了吧，世上还有中央公园、还有剧院、还有性、还有美食、还有漂亮衣服……”

作者早就听过这种反应，一百遍都听过。在第 7 节你就看到，他顺着你的话说下去。他说：“好，好，我们就按你说的来。”

于是第 7 节说：“你只管去欢欢喜喜地吃你的饭，心中快乐地喝酒，因为神已经悦纳你的作为。你的衣服当时常洁白，你头上也不要缺少膏油。”换句话说，去尽情享受美食、派对、打扮得光鲜亮丽，感觉美妙极了；“在你虚空的人生中，享受你所爱的妻子”；换句话说，尽情享受婚姻中的性爱吧，“因为这是你在日光之下劳碌之事上所得的分。”他说：“反正人生终究是虚空，这种虚空感迟早会突破出来。但你还是可以先去吃喝快乐。”

他其实是在说：“你别想就这么把问题敷衍过去。”真正伟大的思想家都不会让你这样逃避问题。释迦牟尼在成佛之前还是悉达多太子的时候，传说他一直被养在王宫里，看不到任何痛苦。直到有一天，他第一次看到一个老人；第二天，他看到一个病人；第三天，他看到一具尸体。他意识到，这一切迟早都会发生在每一个人身上。传说他曾对车夫说：“在人生这样的光景面前，人要能保持镇定，心肠必须多么刚硬啊！”他开始痛哭，说：“衰老——”车夫说：“当然会衰老啊，人人都知道，迟早你会失去容貌、记忆、感觉……人人都明白。”但佛陀说：“既然你们知道这些，为什么你们没有痛哭？为什么你们不去挣扎？这难道不会让一切都变得毫无意义吗？我们必须做点什么，必须认真面对它。”

所有真正伟大的人都这样——他们拒绝让你把这些问题静音。《传道书》的作者也说：“你不要这样做。如果你想放弃仅有的人性，那就继续把这些问题关掉吧。”

所以，他拒绝让你从这个问题底下溜走——世界的不公，尤其是那种终极的不公：宇宙性的虚无与遗忘，使人所做的一切都变得虚空、毫无意义、尽是“捕风”。

但在这段经文里，我们也看到了两个圣经式答案的线索。圣经的立场既不是“逃避不公”，也不是“陷入绝望”，而是第三条道路：既不逃避不公，也不绝望。

你们大概都知道“浪子回头”的故事，但那不是只讲一个迷途小儿的故事。耶稣讲这个比喻，是为了同时对两种人说话：一类是逃离上帝的小儿子，一类是靠“做好人”来赚取上帝喜爱的长子。凯勒在他的书《浪子神》（The Prodigal God）里指出，这个故事揭示了福音的核心——既是对小儿子的盼望，也是对大儿子的提醒，更是邀请所有人来经历神“浪费式”的恩典。

无论你是基督徒，还是仍在探索信仰，《浪子神》都会帮助你以全新的方式来看你与基督的关系。这本书也是我们这个月为支持“福音与生活”事工而预备的回馈礼物，盼望借着你的奉献，让更多人听见基督慷慨、坚韧不拔的爱。

那第三条路到底是什么呢？这些年我越来越觉得，圣经的答案大致可以归纳成两方面：一个是“冷的答案”，一个是“热的答案”。一个是给头脑的，一个是给心的。单独拿任何一边都不够，两者合在一起却非常有力量。《传道书》的作者因为这本书的特殊风格，不是直接把答案讲透，而是给你线索、给你提示，逼你自己去想。

所谓“给头脑的冷答案”，就是一种理性的、哲学性的回答。他在第 3–4 节开始切入这个问题。他在第 4 节说了一句关于“狗”的话，听起来相当惊人——我妻子非常爱狗，我答应过她要把这句话放在适当的语境里来解释。他说：“活着的狗比死了的狮子更好。”

当你想到“狗”，你可能想到的是可爱的宠物、牧羊犬、柯利犬；但在古代世界，狗是一种最卑贱的动物，是吃垃圾的野狗，是啃尸体的。旧约中邪恶的王后耶洗别被丢在街上，结果怎么样？狗来把她吃掉。人们会说：“这再合适不过了，她那么邪恶，配得这样的下场；而且这些狗也低贱到配吃她。”

相对地，狮子在古人的眼中是最尊贵的猛兽，和我们今天的印象差不多。所以，作者在第 4 节说“活着的狗比死了的狮子更好”，这话有多震撼，可想而知。如果不和第 5 节连在一起，你几乎都不敢说出口。

他的意思其实相当激烈：与其做一个为正义而死的高贵之人，不如做一个活着的卑贱之徒——只要能保住性命，就算撒谎、杀人、欺骗都没关系。为任何“崇高价值”而死都不值得。换句话说，在一个只剩今生的世界里，“活着”就是唯一的价值。这话听起来是不是很刺耳？

你会说：“他真的在说这个吗？”是的，你往下看第 5 节，因为那里有一个“因为”（for），他说明原因：“因为爱也好，恨也好，嫉妒也好，到头来都消失了。”这正是许多现代哲学家在说的：如果只有这一生，如果人死了就什么都没有，如果我们只是物质偶然碰撞演化出来的产物，那么所谓“对错善恶”就没有客观意义，一切道德分辨都失去根基。

阿拉斯代尔·麦金太尔这位哲学家在书中用过一个比喻：如果有人第一次见到手表，从没见过这种东西，就拿到手里问：“这个东西好不好？”你怎么回答？你一定会先问：“它是用来做什么的？”如果它是用来钉钉子，那它是个糟糕的工具；如果它是用来看时间，那就要看它准不准确。也就是说，没有一种抽象的“好坏”，所有“好坏”都必须相对于“目的”来判断。

那什么叫“好的人生”呢？如果人只是偶然出现，没有被创造、没有目的，那你凭什么说“伤害别人是不好的”？在一个弱肉强食、适者生存的世界里，多活下来、多压倒别人，反而才是“合理”。于是，“活着的狗比死了的狮子更好”就变成了唯一的逻辑。你又凭什么说这样“不好”？你没有立足点来做这种道德判断。

可是，在第 3 节，他又说：“人的心充满恶。”也就是说，一方面他说“一切都是虚空”，价值和意义都被抽空了；另一方面，他又说“人的恶是一个问题”。

旧约学者德里克·基德纳在注释这节经文时说：我们也许一开始没有注意到，第 3 节里那种“愤慨感”本身，跟我们的必死性一样，都是“关于人类的事实”。我们深深知道有些事情“不对劲”，这种“道德愤怒感”本身就是我们人性的一部分。《传道书》整卷书的张力，就在于观察到的事实，与我们内心执拗地坚持的直觉之间不断碰撞，把我们推向一种超出本书字面范畴以外的综合结论。

如果你相信“这一生就是全部”，那么严格来讲就没有所谓“不公不义”；然而你内心深处却又知道，某些事情的确是恶的、是不公的。一方面你说“一切都是虚空”，另一方面你又忍不住说：“这太不公平了，这太错了。”这种矛盾正是世俗不信世界观内在的撕裂。

换一个方式说：如果有神，苦难与邪恶当然是个难题，是信仰必须面对的难关——你会问：神为什么不阻止？为什么允许这些事发生？我们也许不知道答案。但如果没有神，苦难反而成了更大的问题——因为你连“邪恶”和“不公”这两个词都失去客观意义，你没有基点来对世界说：“这不对。”

如果你说：“我之所以不相信有神，就是因为世界上有这么多恶。”那你要问问自己：你凭什么这么强烈地觉得这些事“就是不对”？你的世界观其实没有给你这种“道德愤慨”的基础。换句话说：邪恶固然是信仰的难题，但它更是“无神论”的致命难题。如果邪恶真的让你痛心，那你的心里已经在承认某种“超越”的标准，你其实已经在假定有一位公义的裁判者存在。

这就是所谓“给头脑的冷答案”。很多基督徒哲学家都在论证这一点：邪恶当然给信仰带来困难，但拒绝神并不能解决问题，只会让问题更大。你只有两个选项：要么你承认有一位神，同时老实面对“为什么祂允许这些事”的张力；要么你否认有神，却发现自己连“这不公平”都说不出口。

不过我刚才已经提醒过你了：如果你现在没有在受苦，这个“冷答案”会显得很有趣、很有启发性；但如果你正处在巨大痛苦中，这个答案听起来就很冰冷、几乎没有安慰。你需要的不只是逻辑，还有一位可以拥抱的神。

C.S.路易斯在《卑微的哀恸》（A Grief Observed）里，在妻子去世之后写道：他现在最害怕的，并不是“没有神”，而是“如果有一位神，我怕他是什么样的人”。换言之，他害怕遇见的是一个自己不喜欢的神。

基督信仰并不只有“冷答案”。那只是其中一半，很多宗教也有类似的思路。基督信仰还有另一半——一个“热答案”，一个给心的答案，一个关系性的答案。

这个“热答案”的线索，就藏在本章结尾那个看似奇怪的小故事里。作者说：“我又见日光之下有一种智慧，在我看来甚为重大。”原文“甚为重大”有“极其惊讶、困惑”的意思。他看见了一种前所未见的智慧，让他震撼、叫他摸不着头脑。

故事是这样：有一座小城，城里的人不多。有一位大君王率军前来攻城，筑起高大的围城工事，把这座小城团团围住。照理说，这城必败无疑，毫无希望。然而城里有一个贫穷但有智慧的人，用他的智慧拯救了这座城——圣经没有告诉我们他具体怎么做，但结果是整座城得救了。

这是第一点：这是一个“拯救的智慧”，它的能力大到足以救出一座注定要灭亡的城市。

第二点，更奇怪的是：这是一个“服事的智慧”。在旧约里，“智慧人”通常不会是穷人。如果你读整本《传道书》，会发现作者自己就是那位“传道者”，他是一位王，是富有的人。照常理说，一个真正有智慧、有能力的人，必然会在社会上往上爬，会挣到钱，会有地位。那一个真正“智慧的人”怎么会是穷人呢？

这里作者突然看见一个从未见过的景象：一个真正有超自然智慧、能拯救众人的人，却没有用他的智慧谋取权力和地位，而是选择卑微地服事别人。

第三点，更惊人的是：这样一位拯救者，最后却被人彻底遗忘，甚至遭人藐视。经文说：“却没有人记念那穷人……那贫穷人的智慧被人藐视，他的话也无人听从。”这不是一般的“时间久了大家淡忘”，而是一种带着敌意的遗忘——人们选择背弃这位拯救他们的人。

我有个朋友辛克莱·弗格森曾经写过一本关于《传道书》的书，书名就叫《评论员的愚昧》（Pundit’s Folly），因为他把《传道书》的作者叫做“评论员”。他在书里说，上帝在我们生命里到处摆下见证，让我们无处可逃。你无论往哪里跑，总会撞见一些“预表”，一些指向他的影子。他说，当你读到 9 章 13–16 节的时候，很难不想到有一位“贫穷却有智慧的人”，他成了救主，却被自己的百姓拒绝——你脑中最自然浮现的名字是谁？

那位“评论员”在异象里看到的人，只是那位更大智慧者的影子，是“智慧本身”的一个剪影。正如保罗所说，“基督钉十字架，在犹太人是绊脚石，在外邦人是愚拙；但在蒙召的人，却是神的能力、神的智慧。”

这就是“热答案”的线索：我们面对的不是一位远在天边、冷冷地说“我有充分理由允许这些事发生，你们只能接受”的神。他不是说：“如果你拒绝我，只会更糟，所以你最好安分点。”基督教的神做了一件不可思议的事。

福音是什么？福音是：我们忘记了神——“是他造了我们，我们本是属他的”，但我们却忘了他。我们每天过日子，好像自己才是神。于是，我们从那位唯一永恒者那里转身，投向一切暂时的东西，结果自己也成了迟早被遗忘的存在。

《传道书》的作者、佛陀以及许多伟大的思想家都在推你面对这一点：人生最可怕的事，就是被遗忘——被人忘记你是谁，被人忘记你曾经存在。哪怕在很小的层面，被人遗忘也是极大的痛；在宇宙尺度上，那就更恐怖了。我们内心深处隐约知道，前面等着我们的，是一种宇宙性的遗忘与虚无，而我们无法承受。

但神为此做了什么呢？祂差自己的儿子进入世界。十字架是神的智慧——但当耶稣挂在十字架上的时候，他没有给我们上一堂哲学课，没有说：“让我解释给你们听，为什么不信神的人面对苦难的问题比信神的人更难解。”他只说了一句：“我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？”

在十字架上，发生的事就是：父神把本该落在我们身上的“宇宙性遗忘”倾倒在祂身上，转过脸去不再看祂，把本该属于我们的结局加在祂身上。耶稣被朋友离弃，被敌人弃绝，甚至被父神撇下。他经历了作者所说的那种“终极的被遗忘”，好让我们不再被遗忘。

这就是为什么神能在《以赛亚书》 49 章说：“妇人焉能忘记她吃奶的婴孩，不怜恤她所生的儿子？即或有忘记的，我却不忘记你。看哪，我将你铭刻在我掌上。”神为什么能说，祂永不忘记你？因为你该受的那种“被忘记”，已经落在耶稣身上。

如果你是基督徒，你可以坦然地走进这个世界，知道宇宙性遗忘再也不属于你——你被永远记念、被永远爱着。你因此能真正享受世界上那些美好的事物，而不用害怕它们有一天全部失去，因为你最深的安全感已经安放在基督身上了。基督徒因此可以唱：“纵然世人轻看我，我的神却不忘记我；祂既为我代求，我就必得保守。”

如果你今天还不是基督徒，但你在寻找，你手上其实已经握有“冷答案”和“热答案”这两条线索。你不仅需要在理性上想清楚，也需要去认识这位神——一位亲自进入苦难、比任何人都更深地经历不公与痛苦的神。

如果你已经是基督徒，让我告诉你，你现在最大的属灵问题是什么。其实就是——你忘了那位“穷乏人”。你忘了那位为你死的救主。诗人说：“我的心哪，你要称颂耶和华，不可忘记他的一切恩惠。”诗人每天一醒来就提醒自己：我今天最大的危险，就是忘记神为我做的一切，忘记那位担当我“被遗忘”的主。

如果你今天正被人拒绝，以至于很痛苦、很绝望，那是因为你忘了：唯一真正重要的那一位——那位永恒的、他的爱永不止息的神——现在仍然爱你，因着耶稣，你在祂面前永远不会被遗忘。

如果你今天是基督徒，你所有的问题，从根本上说，都在于你忘记了那位“穷乏的智慧人”。你需要再次把心充满对他为你所做之事的记念。

记念这位“穷乏人”，你就必永远活着；记念这位“穷乏人”，你就必永远被爱。

让我们祷告：

主上帝，我们感谢你，因为你的儿子，从永恒里就爱你、认识你；而你却在十字架上，把我们该受的“被遗忘”都倾倒在他身上。因为这件事，我们可以知道，你永不会忘记我们。

主啊，哲学可以把我们带到某个边缘，甚至给我们某些理性上的答案，但唯有认识你的儿子，才能让我们走进这个世界，在苦难中不致麻木、也不致绝望。我们感谢你，因为唯有在十字架前，我们才得到面对人生不公的真正资源。

我为那些正在经历不公、受伤害的人祷告，求你让他们在基督所受的苦难中，找到赦免与刚强；也为那些还不认识你的人祷告，求你借着他们心中的绝望——那其实是你圣灵的礼物——引导他们看见耶稣是谁，以及他为他们所成就的一切。

奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。

在今天的播客中，提姆·凯勒要带我们来看《传道书》，看看这卷书如何帮助我们面对心中的怀疑、恐惧和不确定，并且把我们带向在基督里那永恒的盼望和真正的意义。我们先来读一段经文。

现在我们要读的是《传道书》。去年秋天，我讲过一篇关于《传道书》的讲道，从那以后我就一直想再回来讲这卷书。九月份，我们会一连几周来思想这本书的一些基本主题。你会马上发现，这卷书跟圣经里其它书非常不一样，这一点一读就能感觉出来。

《传道书》第九章，我们要读第 2–16 节：

“凡临到众人的事都是一样，就是义人和恶人，好人和坏人，洁净的和不洁净的，献祭的和不献祭的，好人如何，罪人也如何；起誓的怎样，怕起誓的也怎样。凡活着的人都知道必死；死了的人毫无所知，也不再得赏赐，他们的名无人记念。他们的爱，他们的恨，他们的嫉妒早都消灭了，在日光之下所行的一切事上，他们永不再有分。…凡你手所当做的事，要尽力去做，因为在你所必去的阴间，没有工作，没有谋算，没有知识，也没有智慧。…我又转念，见日光之下快跑的未必能赢，力战的未必得胜，智慧的未必得粮食，明哲的未必得资财，灵巧的未必得喜悦，所临到众人的，是在乎当时的机会。原来人也不知道自己的定期；鱼被恶网圈住，鸟被网罗捉住，祸患忽然临到的时候，世人陷在其中也是如此。…我见日光之下有一样智慧，据我看乃是广大，就是有一小城，其中的人数稀少，有大君王来攻击，修筑营垒，将城围困。城中有一个贫穷的智慧人，他用智慧救了那城，却没有人记念那穷人。于是我说：‘智慧胜过勇力，然而那贫穷人的智慧被人藐视，他的话也无人听从。’”

这是神的话。这是神的话。

在过去几十年里，至少在美国、甚至整个西方世界，从来没有像现在这样，多数人都在进行所谓“属灵探索”。而要进行属灵探索，没有比《传道书》更好的地方了。

“传道书”这个词，是希伯来原文作者称呼自己的一个词的拉丁文翻译。希伯来文叫“传道者”（coheleth），意思很难精确翻出来，大致是“公共教师”“评论者”。有人甚至直接把他叫做“时评员”“专栏作家”，一个对世界现状发表评论的人。

如果你自己，或者你认识的人，正在寻找信仰、寻找上帝、寻找“外面还有什么”，《传道书》是圣经中最合适的一卷。因为在整本圣经里，这大概是唯一一本从一个怀疑者的立场写出来的书——站在一个不信神、一个“实用世俗主义者”的角度来写的。

让我稍微解释一下。如果你不明白这一点，这卷书读起来会非常困惑。比如，你看第 5 节：“死人毫无所知。”这难道是圣经关于死后世界的一贯教导吗？显然不是。那这句话在这里做什么呢？

关键就在于一个短语——“在日光之下”。它在本段经文里反复出现，在整卷《传道书》中出现了几十次，却几乎不出现在圣经其它书卷，也几乎看不到有别的文学作品这样用。

“在日光之下”是什么意思？作者并不是在说：“事情就是如此如此，这是客观事实。”他是在说：“在日光之下看，好像是这样；在日光之下，这个是事实。”他说：“这生命是虚空的。”什么叫“虚空”？意思是：当你只从“日光之下”的角度看人生——也就是只从今生、完全不考虑“日光之上”的永恒、不考虑天上的现实——如果你假设“这一生就是全部”，那么在这样的前提下，人生就是虚空的，这就是“日光之下”的意思。

这位作者特别有帮助的地方在于，他所采取的立场，不是那种抽象的哲学无神论，而更像是当今纽约普通人、乃至整个西方社会普通人的“实用世俗主义”。

什么叫“实用世俗主义”？你会发现，他也会偶尔提到“神”这个词，他也会说“神赐给我们这虚空的人生”。但你在书里看到的“神”，并不是那位圣经的上帝——不是天地的审判者，不是灵魂的爱人。如果你问纽约街头的普通人：“你信上帝吗？”真正那种严格意义上的“哲学无神论者”其实非常少。大多数人会说：“也许有一种至高存在吧，但我们不可能真正知道祂是谁，也不可能知道祂的旨意。”

所以，实用世俗主义的想法就是：这辈子就是全部，我们不知道自己为什么在这儿，人死了也就算了。因此你只能尽量在这一生里“过得好一点”。《传道书》的作者就采用了这样的视角：好，我们就假设你是一个实用世俗主义者，我们来看看站在这一立场上，人生真正是什么样子。

然后他在书中就着人必须面对的三个“人生大工程”展开讨论——接下来这几周我们也会分别讲到这三件事。他说：每一个人都逃不开这三件事——不管你有没有意识到，你都在为此做出选择。哪三件？

第一是“公义”：我要如何面对世界上的不公、邪恶和苦难？
第二是“享乐”：我在哪里可以找到真正的快乐？什么会真正满足我？
第三是“成就”：我这一生要用来做什么？什么值得我用一生去投入？

你不可能完全绕开这几个问题——就算你以为自己没有回答，其实你已经在用自己的方式回答了。《传道书》说：好，我们就从这些问题下手。这也是为什么这本书如此独特、如此有帮助，为什么它最终会把你带到上帝面前。

这本书不只是简单地说：“有怀疑，也有信仰。”它更特别的地方在于——它不仅仅怀疑信仰，也怀疑“不信”。它不只是对“信的人”提问题，它也对“怀疑的人”的怀疑提出怀疑。

这点在今天非常罕见。我们这个时代好像只会质疑信仰，却从不质疑怀疑。本书却在说：如果你要对信仰提出尖锐问题，那你也应该对自己的怀疑同样提出尖锐问题。你每次怀疑的时候，其实也是站在某个立场上怀疑；你不可能凭空怀疑，而不用某个世界观作为立足点。实用世俗主义的立场就是：“这一生是全部。”作者说：好，我们就站在这个立场，来问几个问题。第一个问题就是：既然如此，你要怎么处理“公义与不公”的问题？

对你们当中的一些人而言，这就是你灵命上的核心难题——你信仰上最大的绊脚石，就是你亲眼见过、乃至亲身经历过的那些苦难与不公。对另一些人来说，也许这不是唯一的大问题（接下来几周我们会谈别的问题），但它仍然至关重要：你要如何面对世界的不公？

这位作者在这里做了三件事，我只能大致勾勒一下。首先，他拒绝让你逃避这个问题；其次，他给了我们两个答案的线索。

第一，他不让你逃避。你很容易把这个问题“调静音”。在第 11–12 节，他先谈的是世上那种“随机发生的一般性不公”。他说什么呢？他说：“快跑的未必能赢，力战的未必得胜；有智慧的不一定吃得饱，有聪明的未必致富，有技能的人也未必得人喜爱；时间和机遇临到众人。人也不知道自己的定期，好像鱼被恶网圈住，鸟被网罗捉住，祸患忽然临到的时候，人被陷在其中。”

我为这篇讲道做预备时，读到一位作者的例子：他某一晚观看电视新闻，就把每条新闻的头一句记下来，结果是这样的：

“今晚中东地区再度爆发冲突。三名恐怖分子劫持了一辆校车，引爆炸弹，炸死了自己，也炸死了车上的所有孩子。”

“一个强台风袭击孟加拉国，数千人溺亡，数万人无家可归。”

“高速公路上一起四车连环相撞，导致五人死亡。”

“在布朗克斯区，一名坐在母亲腿上的五岁女孩被流弹击中，当场身亡。”

“研究报告指出，第三世界数千名儿童每天死于本可预防的疾病，只因为那些拥有资源的人出于冷漠、自私与顽固的无知，没有采取行动。”

这说明了什么？这正是《传道书》作者要你看到的现实：不管你是谁，不管你在什么地方，不管你是好人还是坏人，可怕的事情都可能随时、随机地发生在你身上——没有明显的因果正义，完全显得荒谬。小孩子突然被炸死；某个人突然遭遇灾难。就像他所说的，那可能发生在任何人身上，随时都可能临到你。世界上到处都是随机的苦难与残酷，这就是人生的不公，这是他提到的第一点。

他说：“你看——赛跑的不一定得冠军；你也许很能跑，却依然会输。你也许很聪明，却未必成功。人生从根本上是一场‘掷骰子’。”如果你以为：“只要我做对 A、B、C 几件事，人生就一定会顺利。”那你还很年轻。年轻人常常用这种方式“屏蔽”人生的不公：那是“那些人”的事，不会发生在我身上；我要谨慎、要自律、要小心选择环境……作者却说：不，他不会就此打住。

接着，他继续往下走。他不只讲那些随机发生在许多人身上的一般性不公，他还讲到一个更深层、更彻底的不公——那就是每一个人最终都逃不掉的“终极不公”。

在第 3–4 节他说：“义人怎样，罪人也怎样；起誓的怎样，怕起誓的也怎样。这是在日光之下所行的一切事上所发生的恶。”往下看第 5 节：“活着的人知道必死；死了的人毫无所知，也不得再赏赐，他们的名无人记念。”

他不是只在说：“好人受苦、坏人享福，这是一种不公。”那当然也是不公，但还只是“随机事件”。他要说的是更深的：无论你这一生如何生活——哪怕是如第 6 节所说，你活在爱中，或是活在恨中；不论你是恐怖分子还是那个无辜的孩子——你所做的一切终将归于虚无。更糟的是，不但你做过的事最终会消失，就连你留下的影响、你被别人记住的那些东西，也会被彻底遗忘。

如果“这一生就是全部”，那么在每一个人的人生尽头，都有一个虚无在等着你。只要你愿意稍微认真想一想——作者说，他现在就是逼你去想——你就会发现，这样的结局让你这一生所做的一切都变得毫无意义。

不久前我和凯西一起看了一部约翰·塞尔斯的电影《持枪之人》（Men with Guns），是一部很有力量的作品。故事讲的是在某个拉丁美洲国家，有一位医生，训练了一群年轻医生，把他们派到偏远贫穷的山村去，为那些极度需要的人提供医疗。后来他发现，那些被他训练出来、派去服事的人几乎全部被军队或游击队杀害了，也就是说，他所做的一切、他们所献上的一切生命，都在很短时间内被彻底毁掉。

整部电影讲的，就是这位老人家不断冒险进入极其危险的地区，试图找到他曾经训练过的那些年轻人，但他始终找不到。到了最后，他自己也死了，他临终前最后一句话是：“人活着应该留下点什么。”在某个片段，他说：“我不是宗教人士，我是科学家、医生。但我需要知道，我曾经做过什么，使这个世界变得更好一点。我必须知道这一点，否则我的人生就完全没有意义。”

《传道书》的作者在旁边好像在喊：“醒一醒！”就算那些年轻人没有死，情况又怎么样呢？即便你盖了金字塔，你可能会被记得久一点，但最终，若是你死了就腐烂、太阳也死去、万物都腐朽，那么宇宙性遗忘就在每个人生命的终点在等着他。不管你做过什么，不管你是谁，结局都一样——这就让你所做的一切都变得毫无意义、完全虚空。

有人会说：“我知道你要说什么了。我上哲学导论课的时候听过类似的话。这个作者不过是太悲观、太消极罢了。”如果你是一个实用世俗主义者，你也许会说：“对，照这样想下去，你当然会一直忧郁。但算了吧，世上还有中央公园、还有剧院、还有性、还有美食、还有漂亮衣服……”

作者早就听过这种反应，一百遍都听过。在第 7 节你就看到，他顺着你的话说下去。他说：“好，好，我们就按你说的来。”

于是第 7 节说：“你只管去欢欢喜喜地吃你的饭，心中快乐地喝酒，因为神已经悦纳你的作为。你的衣服当时常洁白，你头上也不要缺少膏油。”换句话说，去尽情享受美食、派对、打扮得光鲜亮丽，感觉美妙极了；“在你虚空的人生中，享受你所爱的妻子”；换句话说，尽情享受婚姻中的性爱吧，“因为这是你在日光之下劳碌之事上所得的分。”他说：“反正人生终究是虚空，这种虚空感迟早会突破出来。但你还是可以先去吃喝快乐。”

他其实是在说：“你别想就这么把问题敷衍过去。”真正伟大的思想家都不会让你这样逃避问题。释迦牟尼在成佛之前还是悉达多太子的时候，传说他一直被养在王宫里，看不到任何痛苦。直到有一天，他第一次看到一个老人；第二天，他看到一个病人；第三天，他看到一具尸体。他意识到，这一切迟早都会发生在每一个人身上。传说他曾对车夫说：“在人生这样的光景面前，人要能保持镇定，心肠必须多么刚硬啊！”他开始痛哭，说：“衰老——”车夫说：“当然会衰老啊，人人都知道，迟早你会失去容貌、记忆、感觉……人人都明白。”但佛陀说：“既然你们知道这些，为什么你们没有痛哭？为什么你们不去挣扎？这难道不会让一切都变得毫无意义吗？我们必须做点什么，必须认真面对它。”

所有真正伟大的人都这样——他们拒绝让你把这些问题静音。《传道书》的作者也说：“你不要这样做。如果你想放弃仅有的人性，那就继续把这些问题关掉吧。”

所以，他拒绝让你从这个问题底下溜走——世界的不公，尤其是那种终极的不公：宇宙性的虚无与遗忘，使人所做的一切都变得虚空、毫无意义、尽是“捕风”。

但在这段经文里，我们也看到了两个圣经式答案的线索。圣经的立场既不是“逃避不公”，也不是“陷入绝望”，而是第三条道路：既不逃避不公，也不绝望。

你们大概都知道“浪子回头”的故事，但那不是只讲一个迷途小儿的故事。耶稣讲这个比喻，是为了同时对两种人说话：一类是逃离上帝的小儿子，一类是靠“做好人”来赚取上帝喜爱的长子。凯勒在他的书《浪子神》（The Prodigal God）里指出，这个故事揭示了福音的核心——既是对小儿子的盼望，也是对大儿子的提醒，更是邀请所有人来经历神“浪费式”的恩典。

无论你是基督徒，还是仍在探索信仰，《浪子神》都会帮助你以全新的方式来看你与基督的关系。这本书也是我们这个月为支持“福音与生活”事工而预备的回馈礼物，盼望借着你的奉献，让更多人听见基督慷慨、坚韧不拔的爱。

那第三条路到底是什么呢？这些年我越来越觉得，圣经的答案大致可以归纳成两方面：一个是“冷的答案”，一个是“热的答案”。一个是给头脑的，一个是给心的。单独拿任何一边都不够，两者合在一起却非常有力量。《传道书》的作者因为这本书的特殊风格，不是直接把答案讲透，而是给你线索、给你提示，逼你自己去想。

所谓“给头脑的冷答案”，就是一种理性的、哲学性的回答。他在第 3–4 节开始切入这个问题。他在第 4 节说了一句关于“狗”的话，听起来相当惊人——我妻子非常爱狗，我答应过她要把这句话放在适当的语境里来解释。他说：“活着的狗比死了的狮子更好。”

当你想到“狗”，你可能想到的是可爱的宠物、牧羊犬、柯利犬；但在古代世界，狗是一种最卑贱的动物，是吃垃圾的野狗，是啃尸体的。旧约中邪恶的王后耶洗别被丢在街上，结果怎么样？狗来把她吃掉。人们会说：“这再合适不过了，她那么邪恶，配得这样的下场；而且这些狗也低贱到配吃她。”

相对地，狮子在古人的眼中是最尊贵的猛兽，和我们今天的印象差不多。所以，作者在第 4 节说“活着的狗比死了的狮子更好”，这话有多震撼，可想而知。如果不和第 5 节连在一起，你几乎都不敢说出口。

他的意思其实相当激烈：与其做一个为正义而死的高贵之人，不如做一个活着的卑贱之徒——只要能保住性命，就算撒谎、杀人、欺骗都没关系。为任何“崇高价值”而死都不值得。换句话说，在一个只剩今生的世界里，“活着”就是唯一的价值。这话听起来是不是很刺耳？

你会说：“他真的在说这个吗？”是的，你往下看第 5 节，因为那里有一个“因为”（for），他说明原因：“因为爱也好，恨也好，嫉妒也好，到头来都消失了。”这正是许多现代哲学家在说的：如果只有这一生，如果人死了就什么都没有，如果我们只是物质偶然碰撞演化出来的产物，那么所谓“对错善恶”就没有客观意义，一切道德分辨都失去根基。

阿拉斯代尔·麦金太尔这位哲学家在书中用过一个比喻：如果有人第一次见到手表，从没见过这种东西，就拿到手里问：“这个东西好不好？”你怎么回答？你一定会先问：“它是用来做什么的？”如果它是用来钉钉子，那它是个糟糕的工具；如果它是用来看时间，那就要看它准不准确。也就是说，没有一种抽象的“好坏”，所有“好坏”都必须相对于“目的”来判断。

那什么叫“好的人生”呢？如果人只是偶然出现，没有被创造、没有目的，那你凭什么说“伤害别人是不好的”？在一个弱肉强食、适者生存的世界里，多活下来、多压倒别人，反而才是“合理”。于是，“活着的狗比死了的狮子更好”就变成了唯一的逻辑。你又凭什么说这样“不好”？你没有立足点来做这种道德判断。

可是，在第 3 节，他又说：“人的心充满恶。”也就是说，一方面他说“一切都是虚空”，价值和意义都被抽空了；另一方面，他又说“人的恶是一个问题”。

旧约学者德里克·基德纳在注释这节经文时说：我们也许一开始没有注意到，第 3 节里那种“愤慨感”本身，跟我们的必死性一样，都是“关于人类的事实”。我们深深知道有些事情“不对劲”，这种“道德愤怒感”本身就是我们人性的一部分。《传道书》整卷书的张力，就在于观察到的事实，与我们内心执拗地坚持的直觉之间不断碰撞，把我们推向一种超出本书字面范畴以外的综合结论。

如果你相信“这一生就是全部”，那么严格来讲就没有所谓“不公不义”；然而你内心深处却又知道，某些事情的确是恶的、是不公的。一方面你说“一切都是虚空”，另一方面你又忍不住说：“这太不公平了，这太错了。”这种矛盾正是世俗不信世界观内在的撕裂。

换一个方式说：如果有神，苦难与邪恶当然是个难题，是信仰必须面对的难关——你会问：神为什么不阻止？为什么允许这些事发生？我们也许不知道答案。但如果没有神，苦难反而成了更大的问题——因为你连“邪恶”和“不公”这两个词都失去客观意义，你没有基点来对世界说：“这不对。”

如果你说：“我之所以不相信有神，就是因为世界上有这么多恶。”那你要问问自己：你凭什么这么强烈地觉得这些事“就是不对”？你的世界观其实没有给你这种“道德愤慨”的基础。换句话说：邪恶固然是信仰的难题，但它更是“无神论”的致命难题。如果邪恶真的让你痛心，那你的心里已经在承认某种“超越”的标准，你其实已经在假定有一位公义的裁判者存在。

这就是所谓“给头脑的冷答案”。很多基督徒哲学家都在论证这一点：邪恶当然给信仰带来困难，但拒绝神并不能解决问题，只会让问题更大。你只有两个选项：要么你承认有一位神，同时老实面对“为什么祂允许这些事”的张力；要么你否认有神，却发现自己连“这不公平”都说不出口。

不过我刚才已经提醒过你了：如果你现在没有在受苦，这个“冷答案”会显得很有趣、很有启发性；但如果你正处在巨大痛苦中，这个答案听起来就很冰冷、几乎没有安慰。你需要的不只是逻辑，还有一位可以拥抱的神。

C.S.路易斯在《卑微的哀恸》（A Grief Observed）里，在妻子去世之后写道：他现在最害怕的，并不是“没有神”，而是“如果有一位神，我怕他是什么样的人”。换言之，他害怕遇见的是一个自己不喜欢的神。

基督信仰并不只有“冷答案”。那只是其中一半，很多宗教也有类似的思路。基督信仰还有另一半——一个“热答案”，一个给心的答案，一个关系性的答案。

这个“热答案”的线索，就藏在本章结尾那个看似奇怪的小故事里。作者说：“我又见日光之下有一种智慧，在我看来甚为重大。”原文“甚为重大”有“极其惊讶、困惑”的意思。他看见了一种前所未见的智慧，让他震撼、叫他摸不着头脑。

故事是这样：有一座小城，城里的人不多。有一位大君王率军前来攻城，筑起高大的围城工事，把这座小城团团围住。照理说，这城必败无疑，毫无希望。然而城里有一个贫穷但有智慧的人，用他的智慧拯救了这座城——圣经没有告诉我们他具体怎么做，但结果是整座城得救了。

这是第一点：这是一个“拯救的智慧”，它的能力大到足以救出一座注定要灭亡的城市。

第二点，更奇怪的是：这是一个“服事的智慧”。在旧约里，“智慧人”通常不会是穷人。如果你读整本《传道书》，会发现作者自己就是那位“传道者”，他是一位王，是富有的人。照常理说，一个真正有智慧、有能力的人，必然会在社会上往上爬，会挣到钱，会有地位。那一个真正“智慧的人”怎么会是穷人呢？

这里作者突然看见一个从未见过的景象：一个真正有超自然智慧、能拯救众人的人，却没有用他的智慧谋取权力和地位，而是选择卑微地服事别人。

第三点，更惊人的是：这样一位拯救者，最后却被人彻底遗忘，甚至遭人藐视。经文说：“却没有人记念那穷人……那贫穷人的智慧被人藐视，他的话也无人听从。”这不是一般的“时间久了大家淡忘”，而是一种带着敌意的遗忘——人们选择背弃这位拯救他们的人。

我有个朋友辛克莱·弗格森曾经写过一本关于《传道书》的书，书名就叫《评论员的愚昧》（Pundit’s Folly），因为他把《传道书》的作者叫做“评论员”。他在书里说，上帝在我们生命里到处摆下见证，让我们无处可逃。你无论往哪里跑，总会撞见一些“预表”，一些指向他的影子。他说，当你读到 9 章 13–16 节的时候，很难不想到有一位“贫穷却有智慧的人”，他成了救主，却被自己的百姓拒绝——你脑中最自然浮现的名字是谁？

那位“评论员”在异象里看到的人，只是那位更大智慧者的影子，是“智慧本身”的一个剪影。正如保罗所说，“基督钉十字架，在犹太人是绊脚石，在外邦人是愚拙；但在蒙召的人，却是神的能力、神的智慧。”

这就是“热答案”的线索：我们面对的不是一位远在天边、冷冷地说“我有充分理由允许这些事发生，你们只能接受”的神。他不是说：“如果你拒绝我，只会更糟，所以你最好安分点。”基督教的神做了一件不可思议的事。

福音是什么？福音是：我们忘记了神——“是他造了我们，我们本是属他的”，但我们却忘了他。我们每天过日子，好像自己才是神。于是，我们从那位唯一永恒者那里转身，投向一切暂时的东西，结果自己也成了迟早被遗忘的存在。

《传道书》的作者、佛陀以及许多伟大的思想家都在推你面对这一点：人生最可怕的事，就是被遗忘——被人忘记你是谁，被人忘记你曾经存在。哪怕在很小的层面，被人遗忘也是极大的痛；在宇宙尺度上，那就更恐怖了。我们内心深处隐约知道，前面等着我们的，是一种宇宙性的遗忘与虚无，而我们无法承受。

但神为此做了什么呢？祂差自己的儿子进入世界。十字架是神的智慧——但当耶稣挂在十字架上的时候，他没有给我们上一堂哲学课，没有说：“让我解释给你们听，为什么不信神的人面对苦难的问题比信神的人更难解。”他只说了一句：“我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？”

在十字架上，发生的事就是：父神把本该落在我们身上的“宇宙性遗忘”倾倒在祂身上，转过脸去不再看祂，把本该属于我们的结局加在祂身上。耶稣被朋友离弃，被敌人弃绝，甚至被父神撇下。他经历了作者所说的那种“终极的被遗忘”，好让我们不再被遗忘。

这就是为什么神能在《以赛亚书》 49 章说：“妇人焉能忘记她吃奶的婴孩，不怜恤她所生的儿子？即或有忘记的，我却不忘记你。看哪，我将你铭刻在我掌上。”神为什么能说，祂永不忘记你？因为你该受的那种“被忘记”，已经落在耶稣身上。

如果你是基督徒，你可以坦然地走进这个世界，知道宇宙性遗忘再也不属于你——你被永远记念、被永远爱着。你因此能真正享受世界上那些美好的事物，而不用害怕它们有一天全部失去，因为你最深的安全感已经安放在基督身上了。基督徒因此可以唱：“纵然世人轻看我，我的神却不忘记我；祂既为我代求，我就必得保守。”

如果你今天还不是基督徒，但你在寻找，你手上其实已经握有“冷答案”和“热答案”这两条线索。你不仅需要在理性上想清楚，也需要去认识这位神——一位亲自进入苦难、比任何人都更深地经历不公与痛苦的神。

如果你已经是基督徒，让我告诉你，你现在最大的属灵问题是什么。其实就是——你忘了那位“穷乏人”。你忘了那位为你死的救主。诗人说：“我的心哪，你要称颂耶和华，不可忘记他的一切恩惠。”诗人每天一醒来就提醒自己：我今天最大的危险，就是忘记神为我做的一切，忘记那位担当我“被遗忘”的主。

如果你今天正被人拒绝，以至于很痛苦、很绝望，那是因为你忘了：唯一真正重要的那一位——那位永恒的、他的爱永不止息的神——现在仍然爱你，因着耶稣，你在祂面前永远不会被遗忘。

如果你今天是基督徒，你所有的问题，从根本上说，都在于你忘记了那位“穷乏的智慧人”。你需要再次把心充满对他为你所做之事的记念。

记念这位“穷乏人”，你就必永远活着；记念这位“穷乏人”，你就必永远被爱。

让我们祷告：

主上帝，我们感谢你，因为你的儿子，从永恒里就爱你、认识你；而你却在十字架上，把我们该受的“被遗忘”都倾倒在他身上。因为这件事，我们可以知道，你永不会忘记我们。

主啊，哲学可以把我们带到某个边缘，甚至给我们某些理性上的答案，但唯有认识你的儿子，才能让我们走进这个世界，在苦难中不致麻木、也不致绝望。我们感谢你，因为唯有在十字架前，我们才得到面对人生不公的真正资源。

我为那些正在经历不公、受伤害的人祷告，求你让他们在基督所受的苦难中，找到赦免与刚强；也为那些还不认识你的人祷告，求你借着他们心中的绝望——那其实是你圣灵的礼物——引导他们看见耶稣是谁，以及他为他们所成就的一切。

奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。

在今天的播客中，提姆·凯勒要带我们来看《传道书》，看看这卷书如何帮助我们面对心中的怀疑、恐惧和不确定，并且把我们带向在基督里那永恒的盼望和真正的意义。我们先来读一段经文。

现在我们要读的是《传道书》。去年秋天，我讲过一篇关于《传道书》的讲道，从那以后我就一直想再回来讲这卷书。九月份，我们会一连几周来思想这本书的一些基本主题。你会马上发现，这卷书跟圣经里其它书非常不一样，这一点一读就能感觉出来。

《传道书》第九章，我们要读第 2–16 节：

“凡临到众人的事都是一样，就是义人和恶人，好人和坏人，洁净的和不洁净的，献祭的和不献祭的，好人如何，罪人也如何；起誓的怎样，怕起誓的也怎样。凡活着的人都知道必死；死了的人毫无所知，也不再得赏赐，他们的名无人记念。他们的爱，他们的恨，他们的嫉妒早都消灭了，在日光之下所行的一切事上，他们永不再有分。…凡你手所当做的事，要尽力去做，因为在你所必去的阴间，没有工作，没有谋算，没有知识，也没有智慧。…我又转念，见日光之下快跑的未必能赢，力战的未必得胜，智慧的未必得粮食，明哲的未必得资财，灵巧的未必得喜悦，所临到众人的，是在乎当时的机会。原来人也不知道自己的定期；鱼被恶网圈住，鸟被网罗捉住，祸患忽然临到的时候，世人陷在其中也是如此。…我见日光之下有一样智慧，据我看乃是广大，就是有一小城，其中的人数稀少，有大君王来攻击，修筑营垒，将城围困。城中有一个贫穷的智慧人，他用智慧救了那城，却没有人记念那穷人。于是我说：‘智慧胜过勇力，然而那贫穷人的智慧被人藐视，他的话也无人听从。’”

这是神的话。这是神的话。

在过去几十年里，至少在美国、甚至整个西方世界，从来没有像现在这样，多数人都在进行所谓“属灵探索”。而要进行属灵探索，没有比《传道书》更好的地方了。

“传道书”这个词，是希伯来原文作者称呼自己的一个词的拉丁文翻译。希伯来文叫“传道者”（coheleth），意思很难精确翻出来，大致是“公共教师”“评论者”。有人甚至直接把他叫做“时评员”“专栏作家”，一个对世界现状发表评论的人。

如果你自己，或者你认识的人，正在寻找信仰、寻找上帝、寻找“外面还有什么”，《传道书》是圣经中最合适的一卷。因为在整本圣经里，这大概是唯一一本从一个怀疑者的立场写出来的书——站在一个不信神、一个“实用世俗主义者”的角度来写的。

让我稍微解释一下。如果你不明白这一点，这卷书读起来会非常困惑。比如，你看第 5 节：“死人毫无所知。”这难道是圣经关于死后世界的一贯教导吗？显然不是。那这句话在这里做什么呢？

关键就在于一个短语——“在日光之下”。它在本段经文里反复出现，在整卷《传道书》中出现了几十次，却几乎不出现在圣经其它书卷，也几乎看不到有别的文学作品这样用。

“在日光之下”是什么意思？作者并不是在说：“事情就是如此如此，这是客观事实。”他是在说：“在日光之下看，好像是这样；在日光之下，这个是事实。”他说：“这生命是虚空的。”什么叫“虚空”？意思是：当你只从“日光之下”的角度看人生——也就是只从今生、完全不考虑“日光之上”的永恒、不考虑天上的现实——如果你假设“这一生就是全部”，那么在这样的前提下，人生就是虚空的，这就是“日光之下”的意思。

这位作者特别有帮助的地方在于，他所采取的立场，不是那种抽象的哲学无神论，而更像是当今纽约普通人、乃至整个西方社会普通人的“实用世俗主义”。

什么叫“实用世俗主义”？你会发现，他也会偶尔提到“神”这个词，他也会说“神赐给我们这虚空的人生”。但你在书里看到的“神”，并不是那位圣经的上帝——不是天地的审判者，不是灵魂的爱人。如果你问纽约街头的普通人：“你信上帝吗？”真正那种严格意义上的“哲学无神论者”其实非常少。大多数人会说：“也许有一种至高存在吧，但我们不可能真正知道祂是谁，也不可能知道祂的旨意。”

所以，实用世俗主义的想法就是：这辈子就是全部，我们不知道自己为什么在这儿，人死了也就算了。因此你只能尽量在这一生里“过得好一点”。《传道书》的作者就采用了这样的视角：好，我们就假设你是一个实用世俗主义者，我们来看看站在这一立场上，人生真正是什么样子。

然后他在书中就着人必须面对的三个“人生大工程”展开讨论——接下来这几周我们也会分别讲到这三件事。他说：每一个人都逃不开这三件事——不管你有没有意识到，你都在为此做出选择。哪三件？

第一是“公义”：我要如何面对世界上的不公、邪恶和苦难？
第二是“享乐”：我在哪里可以找到真正的快乐？什么会真正满足我？
第三是“成就”：我这一生要用来做什么？什么值得我用一生去投入？

你不可能完全绕开这几个问题——就算你以为自己没有回答，其实你已经在用自己的方式回答了。《传道书》说：好，我们就从这些问题下手。这也是为什么这本书如此独特、如此有帮助，为什么它最终会把你带到上帝面前。

这本书不只是简单地说：“有怀疑，也有信仰。”它更特别的地方在于——它不仅仅怀疑信仰，也怀疑“不信”。它不只是对“信的人”提问题，它也对“怀疑的人”的怀疑提出怀疑。

这点在今天非常罕见。我们这个时代好像只会质疑信仰，却从不质疑怀疑。本书却在说：如果你要对信仰提出尖锐问题，那你也应该对自己的怀疑同样提出尖锐问题。你每次怀疑的时候，其实也是站在某个立场上怀疑；你不可能凭空怀疑，而不用某个世界观作为立足点。实用世俗主义的立场就是：“这一生是全部。”作者说：好，我们就站在这个立场，来问几个问题。第一个问题就是：既然如此，你要怎么处理“公义与不公”的问题？

对你们当中的一些人而言，这就是你灵命上的核心难题——你信仰上最大的绊脚石，就是你亲眼见过、乃至亲身经历过的那些苦难与不公。对另一些人来说，也许这不是唯一的大问题（接下来几周我们会谈别的问题），但它仍然至关重要：你要如何面对世界的不公？

这位作者在这里做了三件事，我只能大致勾勒一下。首先，他拒绝让你逃避这个问题；其次，他给了我们两个答案的线索。

第一，他不让你逃避。你很容易把这个问题“调静音”。在第 11–12 节，他先谈的是世上那种“随机发生的一般性不公”。他说什么呢？他说：“快跑的未必能赢，力战的未必得胜；有智慧的不一定吃得饱，有聪明的未必致富，有技能的人也未必得人喜爱；时间和机遇临到众人。人也不知道自己的定期，好像鱼被恶网圈住，鸟被网罗捉住，祸患忽然临到的时候，人被陷在其中。”

我为这篇讲道做预备时，读到一位作者的例子：他某一晚观看电视新闻，就把每条新闻的头一句记下来，结果是这样的：

“今晚中东地区再度爆发冲突。三名恐怖分子劫持了一辆校车，引爆炸弹，炸死了自己，也炸死了车上的所有孩子。”

“一个强台风袭击孟加拉国，数千人溺亡，数万人无家可归。”

“高速公路上一起四车连环相撞，导致五人死亡。”

“在布朗克斯区，一名坐在母亲腿上的五岁女孩被流弹击中，当场身亡。”

“研究报告指出，第三世界数千名儿童每天死于本可预防的疾病，只因为那些拥有资源的人出于冷漠、自私与顽固的无知，没有采取行动。”

这说明了什么？这正是《传道书》作者要你看到的现实：不管你是谁，不管你在什么地方，不管你是好人还是坏人，可怕的事情都可能随时、随机地发生在你身上——没有明显的因果正义，完全显得荒谬。小孩子突然被炸死；某个人突然遭遇灾难。就像他所说的，那可能发生在任何人身上，随时都可能临到你。世界上到处都是随机的苦难与残酷，这就是人生的不公，这是他提到的第一点。

他说：“你看——赛跑的不一定得冠军；你也许很能跑，却依然会输。你也许很聪明，却未必成功。人生从根本上是一场‘掷骰子’。”如果你以为：“只要我做对 A、B、C 几件事，人生就一定会顺利。”那你还很年轻。年轻人常常用这种方式“屏蔽”人生的不公：那是“那些人”的事，不会发生在我身上；我要谨慎、要自律、要小心选择环境……作者却说：不，他不会就此打住。

接着，他继续往下走。他不只讲那些随机发生在许多人身上的一般性不公，他还讲到一个更深层、更彻底的不公——那就是每一个人最终都逃不掉的“终极不公”。

在第 3–4 节他说：“义人怎样，罪人也怎样；起誓的怎样，怕起誓的也怎样。这是在日光之下所行的一切事上所发生的恶。”往下看第 5 节：“活着的人知道必死；死了的人毫无所知，也不得再赏赐，他们的名无人记念。”

他不是只在说：“好人受苦、坏人享福，这是一种不公。”那当然也是不公，但还只是“随机事件”。他要说的是更深的：无论你这一生如何生活——哪怕是如第 6 节所说，你活在爱中，或是活在恨中；不论你是恐怖分子还是那个无辜的孩子——你所做的一切终将归于虚无。更糟的是，不但你做过的事最终会消失，就连你留下的影响、你被别人记住的那些东西，也会被彻底遗忘。

如果“这一生就是全部”，那么在每一个人的人生尽头，都有一个虚无在等着你。只要你愿意稍微认真想一想——作者说，他现在就是逼你去想——你就会发现，这样的结局让你这一生所做的一切都变得毫无意义。

不久前我和凯西一起看了一部约翰·塞尔斯的电影《持枪之人》（Men with Guns），是一部很有力量的作品。故事讲的是在某个拉丁美洲国家，有一位医生，训练了一群年轻医生，把他们派到偏远贫穷的山村去，为那些极度需要的人提供医疗。后来他发现，那些被他训练出来、派去服事的人几乎全部被军队或游击队杀害了，也就是说，他所做的一切、他们所献上的一切生命，都在很短时间内被彻底毁掉。

整部电影讲的，就是这位老人家不断冒险进入极其危险的地区，试图找到他曾经训练过的那些年轻人，但他始终找不到。到了最后，他自己也死了，他临终前最后一句话是：“人活着应该留下点什么。”在某个片段，他说：“我不是宗教人士，我是科学家、医生。但我需要知道，我曾经做过什么，使这个世界变得更好一点。我必须知道这一点，否则我的人生就完全没有意义。”

《传道书》的作者在旁边好像在喊：“醒一醒！”就算那些年轻人没有死，情况又怎么样呢？即便你盖了金字塔，你可能会被记得久一点，但最终，若是你死了就腐烂、太阳也死去、万物都腐朽，那么宇宙性遗忘就在每个人生命的终点在等着他。不管你做过什么，不管你是谁，结局都一样——这就让你所做的一切都变得毫无意义、完全虚空。

有人会说：“我知道你要说什么了。我上哲学导论课的时候听过类似的话。这个作者不过是太悲观、太消极罢了。”如果你是一个实用世俗主义者，你也许会说：“对，照这样想下去，你当然会一直忧郁。但算了吧，世上还有中央公园、还有剧院、还有性、还有美食、还有漂亮衣服……”

作者早就听过这种反应，一百遍都听过。在第 7 节你就看到，他顺着你的话说下去。他说：“好，好，我们就按你说的来。”

于是第 7 节说：“你只管去欢欢喜喜地吃你的饭，心中快乐地喝酒，因为神已经悦纳你的作为。你的衣服当时常洁白，你头上也不要缺少膏油。”换句话说，去尽情享受美食、派对、打扮得光鲜亮丽，感觉美妙极了；“在你虚空的人生中，享受你所爱的妻子”；换句话说，尽情享受婚姻中的性爱吧，“因为这是你在日光之下劳碌之事上所得的分。”他说：“反正人生终究是虚空，这种虚空感迟早会突破出来。但你还是可以先去吃喝快乐。”

他其实是在说：“你别想就这么把问题敷衍过去。”真正伟大的思想家都不会让你这样逃避问题。释迦牟尼在成佛之前还是悉达多太子的时候，传说他一直被养在王宫里，看不到任何痛苦。直到有一天，他第一次看到一个老人；第二天，他看到一个病人；第三天，他看到一具尸体。他意识到，这一切迟早都会发生在每一个人身上。传说他曾对车夫说：“在人生这样的光景面前，人要能保持镇定，心肠必须多么刚硬啊！”他开始痛哭，说：“衰老——”车夫说：“当然会衰老啊，人人都知道，迟早你会失去容貌、记忆、感觉……人人都明白。”但佛陀说：“既然你们知道这些，为什么你们没有痛哭？为什么你们不去挣扎？这难道不会让一切都变得毫无意义吗？我们必须做点什么，必须认真面对它。”

所有真正伟大的人都这样——他们拒绝让你把这些问题静音。《传道书》的作者也说：“你不要这样做。如果你想放弃仅有的人性，那就继续把这些问题关掉吧。”

所以，他拒绝让你从这个问题底下溜走——世界的不公，尤其是那种终极的不公：宇宙性的虚无与遗忘，使人所做的一切都变得虚空、毫无意义、尽是“捕风”。

但在这段经文里，我们也看到了两个圣经式答案的线索。圣经的立场既不是“逃避不公”，也不是“陷入绝望”，而是第三条道路：既不逃避不公，也不绝望。

你们大概都知道“浪子回头”的故事，但那不是只讲一个迷途小儿的故事。耶稣讲这个比喻，是为了同时对两种人说话：一类是逃离上帝的小儿子，一类是靠“做好人”来赚取上帝喜爱的长子。凯勒在他的书《浪子神》（The Prodigal God）里指出，这个故事揭示了福音的核心——既是对小儿子的盼望，也是对大儿子的提醒，更是邀请所有人来经历神“浪费式”的恩典。

无论你是基督徒，还是仍在探索信仰，《浪子神》都会帮助你以全新的方式来看你与基督的关系。这本书也是我们这个月为支持“福音与生活”事工而预备的回馈礼物，盼望借着你的奉献，让更多人听见基督慷慨、坚韧不拔的爱。

那第三条路到底是什么呢？这些年我越来越觉得，圣经的答案大致可以归纳成两方面：一个是“冷的答案”，一个是“热的答案”。一个是给头脑的，一个是给心的。单独拿任何一边都不够，两者合在一起却非常有力量。《传道书》的作者因为这本书的特殊风格，不是直接把答案讲透，而是给你线索、给你提示，逼你自己去想。

所谓“给头脑的冷答案”，就是一种理性的、哲学性的回答。他在第 3–4 节开始切入这个问题。他在第 4 节说了一句关于“狗”的话，听起来相当惊人——我妻子非常爱狗，我答应过她要把这句话放在适当的语境里来解释。他说：“活着的狗比死了的狮子更好。”

当你想到“狗”，你可能想到的是可爱的宠物、牧羊犬、柯利犬；但在古代世界，狗是一种最卑贱的动物，是吃垃圾的野狗，是啃尸体的。旧约中邪恶的王后耶洗别被丢在街上，结果怎么样？狗来把她吃掉。人们会说：“这再合适不过了，她那么邪恶，配得这样的下场；而且这些狗也低贱到配吃她。”

相对地，狮子在古人的眼中是最尊贵的猛兽，和我们今天的印象差不多。所以，作者在第 4 节说“活着的狗比死了的狮子更好”，这话有多震撼，可想而知。如果不和第 5 节连在一起，你几乎都不敢说出口。

他的意思其实相当激烈：与其做一个为正义而死的高贵之人，不如做一个活着的卑贱之徒——只要能保住性命，就算撒谎、杀人、欺骗都没关系。为任何“崇高价值”而死都不值得。换句话说，在一个只剩今生的世界里，“活着”就是唯一的价值。这话听起来是不是很刺耳？

你会说：“他真的在说这个吗？”是的，你往下看第 5 节，因为那里有一个“因为”（for），他说明原因：“因为爱也好，恨也好，嫉妒也好，到头来都消失了。”这正是许多现代哲学家在说的：如果只有这一生，如果人死了就什么都没有，如果我们只是物质偶然碰撞演化出来的产物，那么所谓“对错善恶”就没有客观意义，一切道德分辨都失去根基。

阿拉斯代尔·麦金太尔这位哲学家在书中用过一个比喻：如果有人第一次见到手表，从没见过这种东西，就拿到手里问：“这个东西好不好？”你怎么回答？你一定会先问：“它是用来做什么的？”如果它是用来钉钉子，那它是个糟糕的工具；如果它是用来看时间，那就要看它准不准确。也就是说，没有一种抽象的“好坏”，所有“好坏”都必须相对于“目的”来判断。

那什么叫“好的人生”呢？如果人只是偶然出现，没有被创造、没有目的，那你凭什么说“伤害别人是不好的”？在一个弱肉强食、适者生存的世界里，多活下来、多压倒别人，反而才是“合理”。于是，“活着的狗比死了的狮子更好”就变成了唯一的逻辑。你又凭什么说这样“不好”？你没有立足点来做这种道德判断。

可是，在第 3 节，他又说：“人的心充满恶。”也就是说，一方面他说“一切都是虚空”，价值和意义都被抽空了；另一方面，他又说“人的恶是一个问题”。

旧约学者德里克·基德纳在注释这节经文时说：我们也许一开始没有注意到，第 3 节里那种“愤慨感”本身，跟我们的必死性一样，都是“关于人类的事实”。我们深深知道有些事情“不对劲”，这种“道德愤怒感”本身就是我们人性的一部分。《传道书》整卷书的张力，就在于观察到的事实，与我们内心执拗地坚持的直觉之间不断碰撞，把我们推向一种超出本书字面范畴以外的综合结论。

如果你相信“这一生就是全部”，那么严格来讲就没有所谓“不公不义”；然而你内心深处却又知道，某些事情的确是恶的、是不公的。一方面你说“一切都是虚空”，另一方面你又忍不住说：“这太不公平了，这太错了。”这种矛盾正是世俗不信世界观内在的撕裂。

换一个方式说：如果有神，苦难与邪恶当然是个难题，是信仰必须面对的难关——你会问：神为什么不阻止？为什么允许这些事发生？我们也许不知道答案。但如果没有神，苦难反而成了更大的问题——因为你连“邪恶”和“不公”这两个词都失去客观意义，你没有基点来对世界说：“这不对。”

如果你说：“我之所以不相信有神，就是因为世界上有这么多恶。”那你要问问自己：你凭什么这么强烈地觉得这些事“就是不对”？你的世界观其实没有给你这种“道德愤慨”的基础。换句话说：邪恶固然是信仰的难题，但它更是“无神论”的致命难题。如果邪恶真的让你痛心，那你的心里已经在承认某种“超越”的标准，你其实已经在假定有一位公义的裁判者存在。

这就是所谓“给头脑的冷答案”。很多基督徒哲学家都在论证这一点：邪恶当然给信仰带来困难，但拒绝神并不能解决问题，只会让问题更大。你只有两个选项：要么你承认有一位神，同时老实面对“为什么祂允许这些事”的张力；要么你否认有神，却发现自己连“这不公平”都说不出口。

不过我刚才已经提醒过你了：如果你现在没有在受苦，这个“冷答案”会显得很有趣、很有启发性；但如果你正处在巨大痛苦中，这个答案听起来就很冰冷、几乎没有安慰。你需要的不只是逻辑，还有一位可以拥抱的神。

C.S.路易斯在《卑微的哀恸》（A Grief Observed）里，在妻子去世之后写道：他现在最害怕的，并不是“没有神”，而是“如果有一位神，我怕他是什么样的人”。换言之，他害怕遇见的是一个自己不喜欢的神。

基督信仰并不只有“冷答案”。那只是其中一半，很多宗教也有类似的思路。基督信仰还有另一半——一个“热答案”，一个给心的答案，一个关系性的答案。

这个“热答案”的线索，就藏在本章结尾那个看似奇怪的小故事里。作者说：“我又见日光之下有一种智慧，在我看来甚为重大。”原文“甚为重大”有“极其惊讶、困惑”的意思。他看见了一种前所未见的智慧，让他震撼、叫他摸不着头脑。

故事是这样：有一座小城，城里的人不多。有一位大君王率军前来攻城，筑起高大的围城工事，把这座小城团团围住。照理说，这城必败无疑，毫无希望。然而城里有一个贫穷但有智慧的人，用他的智慧拯救了这座城——圣经没有告诉我们他具体怎么做，但结果是整座城得救了。

这是第一点：这是一个“拯救的智慧”，它的能力大到足以救出一座注定要灭亡的城市。

第二点，更奇怪的是：这是一个“服事的智慧”。在旧约里，“智慧人”通常不会是穷人。如果你读整本《传道书》，会发现作者自己就是那位“传道者”，他是一位王，是富有的人。照常理说，一个真正有智慧、有能力的人，必然会在社会上往上爬，会挣到钱，会有地位。那一个真正“智慧的人”怎么会是穷人呢？

这里作者突然看见一个从未见过的景象：一个真正有超自然智慧、能拯救众人的人，却没有用他的智慧谋取权力和地位，而是选择卑微地服事别人。

第三点，更惊人的是：这样一位拯救者，最后却被人彻底遗忘，甚至遭人藐视。经文说：“却没有人记念那穷人……那贫穷人的智慧被人藐视，他的话也无人听从。”这不是一般的“时间久了大家淡忘”，而是一种带着敌意的遗忘——人们选择背弃这位拯救他们的人。

我有个朋友辛克莱·弗格森曾经写过一本关于《传道书》的书，书名就叫《评论员的愚昧》（Pundit’s Folly），因为他把《传道书》的作者叫做“评论员”。他在书里说，上帝在我们生命里到处摆下见证，让我们无处可逃。你无论往哪里跑，总会撞见一些“预表”，一些指向他的影子。他说，当你读到 9 章 13–16 节的时候，很难不想到有一位“贫穷却有智慧的人”，他成了救主，却被自己的百姓拒绝——你脑中最自然浮现的名字是谁？

那位“评论员”在异象里看到的人，只是那位更大智慧者的影子，是“智慧本身”的一个剪影。正如保罗所说，“基督钉十字架，在犹太人是绊脚石，在外邦人是愚拙；但在蒙召的人，却是神的能力、神的智慧。”

这就是“热答案”的线索：我们面对的不是一位远在天边、冷冷地说“我有充分理由允许这些事发生，你们只能接受”的神。他不是说：“如果你拒绝我，只会更糟，所以你最好安分点。”基督教的神做了一件不可思议的事。

福音是什么？福音是：我们忘记了神——“是他造了我们，我们本是属他的”，但我们却忘了他。我们每天过日子，好像自己才是神。于是，我们从那位唯一永恒者那里转身，投向一切暂时的东西，结果自己也成了迟早被遗忘的存在。

《传道书》的作者、佛陀以及许多伟大的思想家都在推你面对这一点：人生最可怕的事，就是被遗忘——被人忘记你是谁，被人忘记你曾经存在。哪怕在很小的层面，被人遗忘也是极大的痛；在宇宙尺度上，那就更恐怖了。我们内心深处隐约知道，前面等着我们的，是一种宇宙性的遗忘与虚无，而我们无法承受。

但神为此做了什么呢？祂差自己的儿子进入世界。十字架是神的智慧——但当耶稣挂在十字架上的时候，他没有给我们上一堂哲学课，没有说：“让我解释给你们听，为什么不信神的人面对苦难的问题比信神的人更难解。”他只说了一句：“我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？”

在十字架上，发生的事就是：父神把本该落在我们身上的“宇宙性遗忘”倾倒在祂身上，转过脸去不再看祂，把本该属于我们的结局加在祂身上。耶稣被朋友离弃，被敌人弃绝，甚至被父神撇下。他经历了作者所说的那种“终极的被遗忘”，好让我们不再被遗忘。

这就是为什么神能在《以赛亚书》 49 章说：“妇人焉能忘记她吃奶的婴孩，不怜恤她所生的儿子？即或有忘记的，我却不忘记你。看哪，我将你铭刻在我掌上。”神为什么能说，祂永不忘记你？因为你该受的那种“被忘记”，已经落在耶稣身上。

如果你是基督徒，你可以坦然地走进这个世界，知道宇宙性遗忘再也不属于你——你被永远记念、被永远爱着。你因此能真正享受世界上那些美好的事物，而不用害怕它们有一天全部失去，因为你最深的安全感已经安放在基督身上了。基督徒因此可以唱：“纵然世人轻看我，我的神却不忘记我；祂既为我代求，我就必得保守。”

如果你今天还不是基督徒，但你在寻找，你手上其实已经握有“冷答案”和“热答案”这两条线索。你不仅需要在理性上想清楚，也需要去认识这位神——一位亲自进入苦难、比任何人都更深地经历不公与痛苦的神。

如果你已经是基督徒，让我告诉你，你现在最大的属灵问题是什么。其实就是——你忘了那位“穷乏人”。你忘了那位为你死的救主。诗人说：“我的心哪，你要称颂耶和华，不可忘记他的一切恩惠。”诗人每天一醒来就提醒自己：我今天最大的危险，就是忘记神为我做的一切，忘记那位担当我“被遗忘”的主。

如果你今天正被人拒绝，以至于很痛苦、很绝望，那是因为你忘了：唯一真正重要的那一位——那位永恒的、他的爱永不止息的神——现在仍然爱你，因着耶稣，你在祂面前永远不会被遗忘。

如果你今天是基督徒，你所有的问题，从根本上说，都在于你忘记了那位“穷乏的智慧人”。你需要再次把心充满对他为你所做之事的记念。

记念这位“穷乏人”，你就必永远活着；记念这位“穷乏人”，你就必永远被爱。

让我们祷告：

主上帝，我们感谢你，因为你的儿子，从永恒里就爱你、认识你；而你却在十字架上，把我们该受的“被遗忘”都倾倒在他身上。因为这件事，我们可以知道，你永不会忘记我们。

主啊，哲学可以把我们带到某个边缘，甚至给我们某些理性上的答案，但唯有认识你的儿子，才能让我们走进这个世界，在苦难中不致麻木、也不致绝望。我们感谢你，因为唯有在十字架前，我们才得到面对人生不公的真正资源。

我为那些正在经历不公、受伤害的人祷告，求你让他们在基督所受的苦难中，找到赦免与刚强；也为那些还不认识你的人祷告，求你借着他们心中的绝望——那其实是你圣灵的礼物——引导他们看见耶稣是谁，以及他为他们所成就的一切。

奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。

在接下来的几周里，我们会继续看这本书里后面的内容，这三周就来看这三个问题。

他等于是在说：我们来看看所有人一生当中都绕不开的三个根本性项目。如果你要活着，就一定要面对这些“基本工程”，你无法回避它们。就算你主观上觉得自己没有在处理这些问题，实际上你也在处理，因为人生里根本离不开它们。而这三个基本工程就是：公义、享乐和成就。成就就是：这一生值得去做的是什么？

“我到底要把一生花在什么事情上？我这一辈子应该在做什么？”

享乐是：我到哪里去寻找快乐？什么才真正能让我满足？

第三个就是：我要怎么面对世界上的不公、不义、邪恶和苦难？

你不可能在人生当中不去问这些问题；即便你觉得自己没在问，你其实已经在用某种方式回答了。传道书作者说：好，我们来看看，为什么传道书这本书那么特别，又那么有帮助，甚至最后把你带到上帝面前。原因在于，传道书不是简单的“怀疑 vs. 信仰”的对立。

这本书很特别的一点，也是它非常“民主”的地方，是：它不仅质疑信仰，也质疑不信。这几乎是当代人很少做的事。

一般人只知道：“好啊，我们来怀疑信仰吧。”但很少有人说：“我们也来怀疑怀疑本身。”你会说：“如果只怀疑信仰，只怀疑信靠上帝，这公平吗？如果你要对信仰提出尖锐的问题，难道不应该也审视你的怀疑？难道不应该怀疑你的怀疑吗？难道不该对不信的立场也提出棘手的问题吗？”

你要知道，就算你在怀疑，你依然是站在某个立场上的。你不可能在“真空”里怀疑。所谓“务实的世俗主义”说：“今生就是全部，仅此而已。”好，传道书的作者就说：那我们来问问这个立场几个问题。

第一个问题就是：你要如何处理人生中的公义问题、以及种种不公？当他开始谈这个问题时，对你们当中的一些人来说，这正好就是你最核心的属灵难题，是你对上帝、对信仰、对一切的一大绊脚石，因为你亲眼见过、或者亲身经历过这样的苦难。对你来说，这是最大的卡点。

对另外一些人来说，也许这不是你最核心的问题（我们之后几周会谈别的），但它仍然非常重要：你要如何面对不公？

这位作者做了三件事，我只能大致勾勒出来。首先，他拒绝让你逃避不公的问题；其次，他给出两个答案的线索。

第一，他拒绝让我们避开这个问题。他把这个问题硬生生摆在我们面前，不让我们把它从脑中屏蔽掉。第二，他给出两条线索，指向关于如何面对不公的两个答案。

先给你看，他是怎样确保你不会避开这个问题的。其实，人很容易想办法把它“静音”。在第 11、12 节，一开始他谈的是世间那种普遍存在的、看似随机的各种不公。他说什么呢？

他说：“赛跑的不一定是跑得快的，打仗的不一定是强壮的，有智慧的不一定得粮食，有聪明的不一定得财富，有灵巧的不一定得喜爱，所临到众人的，是在乎当时的机会。”他又说，“鱼被恶网圈住，鸟被网罗捉住，世人陷在降临的时候，遭遇苦难，也是如此。”

我在预备这篇讲章的时候，看了一位作者提到，他有一晚只是把电视新闻里每一条新闻开头的两句话记下来，结果得到的是这样一串东西：

“今天中东地区再次爆发冲突。三名恐怖分子劫持了一辆校车，引爆炸弹，炸死了他们自己以及车上的所有孩子。”

“一场特大风暴袭击了孟加拉国，数千人溺亡，成千上万人无家可归。”

“高速 261 号公路上发生四车连环相撞事故，导致五人死亡。”

“在布朗克斯区，一名五岁的女孩坐在母亲腿上，被一颗流弹击中身亡。”

还有一条更像是研究报告的统计：“第三世界国家成千上万的儿童每天死于本可以预防的疾病，只因为那些有能力提供治疗的人，出于冷漠、自私和根深蒂固的无知，选择袖手旁观。”

这一长串在说什么？其实就是传道书作者想说的：不管你是谁，身在何处，也不管你是好人还是坏人，可怕的事情不断发生，毫无规律、毫无公义可言，简直疯狂。它可以发生在任何人身上。

突然间，可爱的孩子被炸死；突然间，又发生别的惨剧。正如作者所说：这可以临到任何人，任何时候。你逃不掉，你也不知道什么时候会轮到自己。这个世界充满了随机的苦难与残酷，充满了不公，这就是他首先摆在我们面前的现实。

他说：“你看，赛跑的不一定是跑得快的。”意思是：你也许跑得很快，却不一定赢；你也许非常聪明，却不一定成功，因为归根结底，人生就像掷骰子一样。你以为自己掌控了一切。

如果你以为：“只要我做这个，再做那个，再做那个，我的人生就会顺利。”那说明你非常非常年轻。我常常这样说——大概每两个月我都会讲一遍，然后大家都会笑——因为你们确实还年轻，或者说，笑的只剩下年长的人了，我下次得更留意一点。

你并不在掌控之中。年轻人逃避面对人生不公的一种方式，就是说：“那是发生在那些人身上的，不会发生在我身上。我会好好保护自己，我会非常小心，我会自律，我不会去中东坐校车，我会采取各种预防措施。”

但作者不会让你停在这里。他继续往下说。接下来你们当中有些人会立刻开始为自己辩护，心想：“他太悲观了吧。”等会儿我会回到这一点。他说：“哦，是啊，确实有这样的人。”

他继续往下谈，从那些发生在许多人身上的、随机的一般性不公，进一步谈到发生在所有人身上的、终极的不公。在第 3、4 节他说：“善人怎样，罪人也怎样；起誓的怎样，不起誓的也怎样。”然后在第 5 节说：“活着的人知道自己必死，死了的人毫无所知，也不得再得赏赐，他们的名无人记念。”

对有些人来说，这就是你现在最核心的属灵议题、最大的难题。对另外一些人来说，这也许不是最主要的问题（我们之后几周会讲别的），但仍然极其重要：你要怎么面对不公？

现在，看这位作者做了什么，我只能勾勒出他做的三件事。第一，他拒绝让你回避不公的问题；第二，他给出了两条答案的线索——关于如何面对不公的两个方向。

先来看看，他是怎么确保你不会回避不公的问题的。其实，人非常容易把这个议题“静音”掉。

在第 11、12 节，一开始他谈的是生活中那种普遍存在的、似乎随机的各种不公。他说什么呢？他说：“赛跑的不一定是跑得快的，打仗的不一定是刚强的；有智慧的未必得粮食，有聪明的未必得资财，有灵巧的未必得喜悦，所临到众人的是在乎当时的机会。”接着又说：“鱼被恶网圈住，鸟被网罗捉住，世人陷在降临的时候，遭遇祸患，也是如此。”

我在预备这篇讲章时，看见一位作者写到，有一晚他只是把电视晚间新闻里每条新闻前两句记下来，结果得到的内容大致是这样：

“今天中东地区再度发生冲突。三名恐怖分子劫持了一辆校车，引爆炸弹，炸死了他们和车上的所有孩子。”

“一场特大风暴袭击了孟加拉国，数千人溺亡，成千上万人无家可归。”

“261 号公路上发生四车连环相撞事故，造成五人死亡。”

“在布朗克斯区，一名五岁的女孩坐在母亲腿上，被一颗流弹击中身亡。”

还有一条比较像研究报告的统计：“第三世界国家成千上万的儿童每天死于本可预防的疾病，只因为那些有能力提供治疗的人，出于冷漠、自私以及根深蒂固的无知，选择袖手旁观。”

这一切在说什么？其实就是传道书作者想说的那个事实：不管你是谁，身在何处，不管你是好人还是坏人，可怕的事情不断发生，毫无规律、毫无公义可言，简直疯狂。它可以发生在任何人身上。

可爱的孩子突然被炸死；忽然又有别的灾难发生。正如作者所说：这可以临到任何人，任何时候。你避不开，也永远不知道什么时候会落到自己头上。这个世界充满了随机的痛苦与残酷，充满了不公，这就是他首先让我们面对的现实。

他说：“赛跑的不一定是跑得快的。”意思是：你也许跑得很快，却不一定赢；你也许很聪明，却不一定成功，因为归根结底，人生就像掷骰子一样。你以为自己掌控了一切。

如果你以为：“只要我做这个、再做那个、再做那个，我的人生就会顺利。”那说明你非常非常年轻。我差不多每两个月就会说一回这句话，每次讲大家都笑——因为你们确实还年轻，或者笑的只剩下年长的人了，我下次得观察得更清楚一点。

你其实并不掌控任何东西。年轻人逃避面对人生不公的一种方式，就是说：“那是发生在那些人身上的，不会发生在我身上。我会看好自己的后路，我会非常小心，我会自律，我不会去中东坐校车，我会采取各种防范措施。”

但作者不肯停在这里。他继续往下说。接下来你们当中有些人会立刻开始给自己辩解，觉得：“他太阴郁、太悲观了。”等会儿我会再回到这个问题。

他说：“哦，是啊，确实有这样的人。”接着他继续说下去，从那些发生在很多人身上的、普遍的随机不公，进一步谈到发生在所有人身上的、终极的不公。那就是第 3、4 节所说的：“善人怎样，罪人也怎样；起誓的怎样，不起誓的也怎样。”然后在第 5 节说：“活着的人知道必死，死了的人毫无所知，也不得再得赏赐，他们的名无人记念。”

不论你是谁，是好人还是恶人，是敢在上帝面前起誓的人，还是根本不敢碰宗教的人，最后结局都一样：死亡。死了之后，他们什么也不知道，再没有任何报偿，而且连他们的名字都会被人遗忘。

作者在说什么？他在谈一种终极的不公：死亡本身。它临到每一个人，毫无例外——好人也死，坏人也死，敬畏上帝的人死，不敬畏上帝的人也死。没有所谓“例外待遇”。

这在他看来，是所有“日光之下所行的一切事”中间最大的邪曲——所有东西最后都被死亡一刀切平了。你可以活得再认真、再有道德、再有爱心，你仍然会死；而有些残暴自私的人似乎也照样活得长寿、舒适，最后也一样死去。表面上看，好像没有任何“最终结算”的公义时刻。

这就是他所说的“终极的不公”，是他从一般性的、不规则的世间不公一路推进到的那一点：死亡使一切看起来都毫无意义、毫无区分。

“活着的人知道自己必死。”——这句话听上去简单，却极为锋利。你活着，就知道终有一天要死；你越清醒地承认这一点，你就越难再用各种方式欺骗自己，说“只要我够小心、够努力，这些灾难就不会找上我”。

但“死了的人毫无所知，也不得再得赏赐，他们的名无人记念。”——如果你只从“日光之下”的角度看世界，如果你只接受一个封闭的、没有上帝、没有永恒的宇宙，那么死亡就是这样：没有继续，没有奖赏，没有记念。所有的正义感、道德勇气、牺牲奉献，最后都像被抹掉一样，不再留下痕迹。

作者就是要你直面这件事。他不允许你只停留在那些“也许可以避免的不公”上，好像只要足够小心、足够掌控，就能绕开。相反，他把你逼到一个你绕不过去的现实：

如果世界上没有一位公义的上帝，如果没有超越“日光之下”的终极审判，那么死亡就意味着——所有公义的追求在终局上都得不到伸张，所有不义的人在终局上都不会被追讨。这才是最大的、终极的“不公”。

这就是他在这里要你正视的：不只要看那些随机发生的灾难、不幸，也要看着整个生命结局本身——死亡——然后问：

在这样的世界里，你要如何谈公义？你要如何面对、解释不公？如果你坚持一个完全世俗、封闭的世界观，你有没有足够的资源来应对这些问题？

他们的爱，他们的恨，他们的嫉妒，早已经消失无踪；他们永远不再参与“日光之下所做的一切事”。

他在这里要说什么？他不只是说：好人过得惨、坏人过得好——那当然是一种不公，也确实常常发生，是一种看似随机的人生不公。但他要说的是更深的东西。

他在说：无论你这一生做了什么，无论你是过着一生充满爱的生活（第 6 节说的“爱”），还是充满仇恨的生活，不管你是恐怖分子，还是被炸死的孩子，到最后你所做的一切都会消失；更严重的是，连你所做的一切在世界上留下的“影响”和“记忆”，最终都会被遗忘。

如果今生就是全部，如果你死了就什么都没有了，那在每一个人生命的尽头，都有一个“虚无”在那儿等着你——只要你肯认真想一想（而作者就是要逼你去想），这个虚无会把你做的一切都变得毫无意义。

最近，凯西和我在家看了一部约翰·塞尔斯的新电影《持枪之人》（Men with Guns），非常有力量。故事讲的是，在一个拉丁美洲国家，有一位医生，他训练了一批年轻医生，把他们派往偏远贫穷的山区，为那些最需要的人提供医疗服务。

后来他慢慢发现，那些他训练并派出去的年轻医生，几乎全部都被政府军或游击队杀害了，还没来得及做什么事就死了。于是，他一生投入的心血，和他们所有的付出，似乎统统化为乌有。

整部电影，基本上就是讲他一路深入一个又一个极度危险的地方，只希望能找到每一个年轻人，却始终找不到。到最后，他自己也死了，他临死前的最后一句话是：“一个人总该有一点遗产（legacy）留下。”

电影中有一段，他说：“我不是一个有宗教信仰的人，我是科学家，是医生。但我需要知道，我做过一些事，真的让这个世界变得比从前好一点。如果我不能知道这一点，我的一生就完全没有意义。”

传道书的作者在一旁对我们说：“醒一醒！”——就算那些人暂时还没被杀呢？你想想看：就算你真的建成了“金字塔”那样的伟大工程，你也许会比一般人多被记住一段时间。但如果你死了就朽坏，太阳终有一天也会熄灭，万物最终都要腐朽，那在每一个人生命的终点，都躺着一个“宇宙级的遗忘”。

到那个时候，你做过什么、你是谁，统统没差——“结局一样”，而这会把你现在做的一切都变得毫无意义，毫无指向感。

我知道，有人心里在说：“我明白他在讲什么了，这不就是哲学导论课上那套悲观论调嘛？这种人就是太丧了。”

如果你是一个务实的世俗主义者，你会说：“当然啦，如果你整天往哲学那边想，会一直很沮丧。但现实生活还有中央公园、还有剧院、还有性、还有各种好吃的餐厅、漂亮的衣服……”

你知道吗？作者早就听够你这样的回应了。他已经听过上百次。有人总是说：“是啊是啊，从哲学角度看，生命也许是虚空的，但我们还是好好享受现实生活吧，当个‘正常人’。”

所以，你看他在第 7 节立刻接着说什么。他等于是说：“好，好，那就来吧。”

“你只管欢欢喜喜吃你的饭，心中快乐喝你的酒。”——我暂时不想把后面两篇讲道提前讲完——“你的衣服当时常洁白。”——好好吃、好好玩，举办派对，穿得漂亮，感觉棒极了，对吧？

他接着说：“在你虚空的生命中，同你所爱的妻子享受人生。”——好好享受性、享受婚姻的一切。“因为这是你在日光之下劳碌之事上所得的分。”

他实际上是在说：“尽管去享受吧，反正到头来一切都是‘虚空’。就算你想用这些方式转移注意力，那种虚无感还是会一次次突破出来，把你抓回来。”

他在说：不要自欺。不要用吃喝玩乐和各种“好好生活”的口号，把这个问题调成静音。

你看，他基本上是在说：“好，那就去享受吧。”

“你只管欢欢喜喜吃你的饭，开心地喝你的酒。”——我先不把接下来两篇信息提前讲完——“你的衣服要时常洁白。”——好好吃、好好喝，开派对，打扮得漂亮，感觉棒极了，对吗？

“在你虚空的生命中，与你所爱的妻子享受人生。”——有美食、有聚会、有性爱、有婚姻中的亲密。“因为这是你在日光之下劳碌得来的分。”

他的意思就是：“去享受吧！反正这一切本来就虚空，这种虚空感终究会时不时冲破你设下的防线，直冲你的内心。”你再怎么用“normal life（正常生活）”的姿态掩盖，它还是会透出来。

所有真正伟大的人物，在这点上其实都很像。释迦牟尼在成佛之前，还是悉达多太子的时候，传说他一直被保护在王宫里，不曾真正看过世间的苦难。直到有一次，他离开宫殿出门，第一天看见的是一个老人，第二天看见一个病人，第三天看见一具尸体，他突然意识到：这一切终有一天都会临到每一个人。

按照传统的说法，有一次他转头对赶车的仆人说：“人的心一定得极其刚硬，才能在这样的景象面前仍然镇定自若。”

他开始哀号：“老年……”——仆人回答说：“当然会老啊，谁不知道？你会失去所有的容貌，记忆衰退，感官迟钝，最后连身体的机能也一个个失去。大家都知道会这样啊。”

可悉达多说：“你明明知道这些，却没在哭喊，没有挣扎，没有被逼问：既然如此，这一切岂不都变得毫无意义吗？我们必须做点什么，必须去正面面对这件事。”

所有真正伟大的人都这样——他们拒绝把这个问题调成静音。

那你怎么面对晚间新闻？我知道我自己的反应常常是什么：新闻里说“又有一起爆炸案”，我心里一声“唉，又来了”，然后紧接着：“好了，好了，先关掉吧，孩子们，晚饭好了，关掉电视。”

我们把它关掉，我们“静音”。但传道书的作者说：“你千万别这样做！如果你想把你仅有的那一点点人性也一起丢掉，那就尽管继续这样逃避。”

他拒绝放你从这个问题底下逃走——“这个世界的不公”，尤其是那种极端的、宇宙层面的“不公”：最终一切都归于虚无与被遗忘——这会让你现在所做的每一件事都显得毫无意义、毫无指向，统统成了“虚空”。

但在这段经文里，我们同时也看见——接下来三周我们会更深入看——有两条线索，指向圣经对这个“公义问题”的两个答案。

我的意思是：圣经一方面说，不要把“不公”调成静音，假装看不见；另一方面又说，不要因此陷入彻底的绝望。还有一条“第三条路”。

不要逃避不公，但也不要坠入黑暗的绝望中去——还有一条别的路。

你也许听过“浪子回头”的故事，但那不只是一个关于“小儿子离家胡来”的故事。事实上，耶稣讲这个比喻，是同时对两类人说话：一类是像小儿子那样逃离上帝、任意妄为的人；另一类是像大儿子那样努力守规矩、靠“乖”和“好表现”来换取父亲（上帝）喜爱的人。

在《浪子神》（The Prodigal God）一书里，提姆·凯勒借着这个故事，展示了福音的核心：这是对“小儿子”型的人和“大儿子”型的人同时发出的盼望之讯息——上帝倾倒出来、近乎“浪费”的恩典。它邀请所有人，不论你过去是叛逆远离，还是自以为义，都来经历这位上帝那种“挥霍般丰盛”的恩典。

无论你已经是基督徒，还是还在探索信仰，《浪子神》都会帮助你以全新的眼光看待自己与基督的关系。这本书也是我们在这里要送给你的一个“谢谢礼物”——提醒你：在一个看似充满不公、最终走向虚无的世界里，仍然有一位上帝，他既不让我们逃避不公，也不让我们陷入绝望，而是用他的恩典，开出了一条全然不同的路。

……感谢你在这个月的奉献，让“福音与生活”（Gospel in Life）的事工可以继续把基督那充满恩典、永不放弃的爱，带给全世界更多的人。如果你想索取这本书作为回应的礼物，可以到 gospelandlife.com/give……

那么，究竟那“第三条路”是什么？

这些年下来，我越来越觉得，圣经在这个问题上的答案，其实可以浓缩成两部分——我暂且称它们为“冷的答案”和“热的答案”。一个是给理性的，是比较“冷静”的；一个是给心灵的，是比较“炽热”的。单独分开来看，这两个答案都不够，但如果把它们放在一起，就非常有力量。

而传道书这位作者，因为他就是“传道者”，因为这本书不同于圣经当中任何一本书，他并不是把完整答案摆在你面前，而是给出“线索”。

传道书不是一场讲座，而更像一个研讨会、一个“头脑风暴”的聚会。他会和你角色扮演、会用问题逼你思考、会给你一些通往答案的线索。在这段经文里，他就给了我们那“冷答案”和“热答案”的线索。

我只能简单讲一下。但我要先提醒你：接下来讲理性的那一部分——“冷的答案”时，请你耐心一点。如果你现在并没有在经历什么痛苦、苦难，这个理性的答案听起来会很有意思；但如果你正处在苦难当中，这个理性的答案听起来一定远远不够，甚至难以安慰你。

然而，你必须两者都要有。

那“冷的答案”是什么呢？好，我们不要叫它“冷”，就叫它“给理性的答案”。他在第 3、4 节里触及这一点。第 4 节有一句话听起来对“狗”非常不客气——我妻子非常爱狗，所以我答应她，要给这句话一点背景。

第 4 节说：“活着的狗比死了的狮子更强。”

你想到狗的时候，脑海里可能浮现的是可爱的比格犬、柯利犬；但古代人对“狗”的想象完全不是这样。对古人来说，狗是最卑贱的动物，是街上的食腐者，是到处乱跑、在垃圾堆里翻找、啃尸体的野兽。

在旧约里，恶名昭著的王后耶洗别被人从楼上推下街道时，发生了什么？狗跑来啃食她的尸体。人们会说：“这是她应得的报应——她太邪恶了；而狗配吃这样的尸体——因为狗本身也很卑贱。”

相反，“狮子”在古人心中，就像在我们今天眼里一样，是最尊贵、最高贵的兽中之王。

现在，请看第 4 节在说什么——其实非常惊人。如果这节经文没有和第 5 节连在一起，你几乎会被它吓退。他在第 4 节所说的，其实挺简单，却很震撼：

他说：与其做一头死去的狮子，不如做一只活着的狗。换句话说——

“与其做一个高贵的人，为了正直、真理而丧命，不如做一个趁活着时拼命保命的卑劣之徒——就算你得撒谎、杀人、像狗一样活着，也比为了高贵情操而死更值得。”

你会问：“他真的是这个意思吗？”——看第 5 节一开头的那个“因为”（for），你就知道这确实是他的论证方向。他说：

“因为爱和恨，到最后都要消失。”

他的意思是：“如果今生就是全部，如果人死了就什么都没有了，那么你一生中所有的作为——无论是爱，还是恨——最后都会被抹去；如果你死了就朽坏，如果人类只是各种偶然力量碰撞之下的进化产物，那么根本就没有所谓‘对’和‘错’。一切道德区分都变得毫无根据。”

为什么这么说呢？

阿拉斯代尔·麦金太尔（Alasdair MacIntyre）这位哲学家，在好几本书里把这个问题讲得非常清楚。他说：世界上没有抽象、悬空的“好”；“好”一定是相对“目的”而言的。举个例子——如果有人递给你一只手表，而你这辈子从来没见过“手表”这种东西，然后他问你：“这个表好不好？”你会说：“我怎么知道？它是拿来干嘛的？”

这个例子很好：没有“抽象的好”。如果这块表是拿来钉钉子用的，那它当然是“糟糕透顶”的工具；如果这块表是用来报时的，那就要看它准不准。除非你先知道某样东西是“为了什么而存在的”，不然你根本无法判断它是好还是坏。

那什么样的人，才算“好人”？麦金太尔说，如果人只是偶然的产物，根本没有一个“被赋予的目的”，那你凭什么说“伤害别人是不好的”？

如果我们只是在一个无神、无目的的宇宙里为生存而挣扎，强者吃掉弱者本来就是天经地义，“活着的狗比死了的狮子更强”——你要靠踩别人生存，又有什么不可以？你凭什么说那是“坏”的？谁给你权柄来划定“好”和“坏”的界线？

如果今生就是全部，如果没有上帝，那么就没有真正的善与恶。

但接着，在第 3 节里，他又说了一件有趣的事。尽管他一再说“一切都是虚空、都是捕风”，但在第 3 节他却说：“世人的心充满了恶……”——他仍然用“恶”这个字眼！

也就是说，一方面他好像在说：“一切都是虚空、毫无意义”；另一方面，他却又说：“可是人心里仍然有真正的邪恶，这就是问题。”

我很喜欢的一位解经家德里克·基德纳（Derek Kidner）在注释这节经文时，说了非常有意思的一段话。他大意是这样说的：

“也许我们一开始没有注意到，第 3 节中那种‘愤慨感’本身，其实和‘人的必死’一样，都是关于我们人的一个事实。整卷传道书之所以如此引人入胜，很大程度上就是因为，作者一再把观察到的事实和他内心那些同样顽固、却相互冲突的直觉放在一起，让它们不断碰撞——结果，读者被逼着走向一个超出这本书本身范围的综合答案。”

换句话说，如果你相信“今生就是全部”，那逻辑上你就不能再讲什么“真正的公义或不公”——一切都是自然演化、偶然碰撞。但你内心深处却又清楚：世界上确实有“真正的不公”，确实有“邪恶”，不是吗？

一方面，他说“一切都是虚空、毫无意义”；另一方面，他又说“世人的心充满恶，这是极大的祸患”。这就暴露出一个深刻的张力：

做一个世俗的人，在你心里其实存在着一个巨大的矛盾。

一方面，你说：“我不相信有上帝，我拒绝信仰，因为这世界太不公了。”

另一方面，如果真的没有上帝，如果世界只是物质的组合，没有任何最终目的，那么你连“为什么可以对不公感到愤怒”的根据都没有。你仍然愤怒，这说明你的世界观给不了你这种愤怒的“合法性”。

可以换两种方式来说——也许你之后可以回放录音再听：

如果有上帝，“恶”确实是一个很严重的问题。我们必须面对一个困难的问题：上帝为什么允许邪恶存在？他有他的理由，而我们未必知道。但就算你勉强给出一些解释，这些解释仍然不能抹平受苦者心里的疼痛。

如果有上帝，邪恶是一个大问题。

但反过来，如果“邪恶真的是一个问题”，如果你真心地对这个世界的邪恶感到愤怒，对不公义感到不安，那本身就说明：必定有一位上帝。

因为，如果你的世界观里根本没有上帝，没有超越“日光之下”的任何目的或标准，那么你的愤怒本身就成了一个无法解释的“异物”。

如果你知道“有不公、有邪恶”，可你的世界观却不给你任何理由去说“这是错的”，那说明——你的世界观出问题了。

如果你心里非常清楚：
“这不对！世上确实有一种真正的‘不公’！”

但与此同时，你又抱持着一个完全世俗、封闭的世界观——一个不会允许你谈“绝对善恶”的世界观——那就说明，你心里对正义的直觉，其实在不断抗议你自己的世界观。

这就是所谓的“理性上的答案”所要指出的：

如果你说自己是一个不信上帝的人，因为这个世界太多不公、太多邪恶；

但同时，你对这不公的愤怒和抗议，反而在见证——世界上应该有一位终极的公义者，有一个超越自然的标准，才使得“邪恶”这个词有意义。

所以：

如果有上帝，邪恶确实是一个很难解的问题；

但如果你觉得“邪恶真的是一个问题”，这反而成了上帝存在的一个强有力线索。

这就是那条“冷的答案”、给理性听的答案——它并不拿走你的眼泪，也不能让你的痛立刻消失，但它撕开了一个口子，让你无法再轻易说：“因为世界有不公，所以我拒绝上帝。”

因为从逻辑上说，你之所以会痛恨不公，正是因为在你最深处，你已经在假定：

这个宇宙不应该是这样的。

如果你心里真的知道“这个世界不应该是这样”的话，那就已经在偷偷诉说：必定有一位公义者、一个真正的“尺度”，使你有资格对不公义感到愤怒。

这就是理性层面上的那条线索——“冷的答案”。

但圣经不会只停在这里。它还有另一条“热的答案”，是给心灵、给正在受苦的人的——它不是在哲学课堂上讨论出来的，而是写在一位被钉十架的上帝之子的身体上。

那是另外一个故事了。

（本段原文缺失或为广告/过场内容，此处保留空白，以保持段落编号一致。）

答案是什么呢？——我要告诉你，其实是：你忘了那位“穷人”。

你们当中有些人今天坐在这里，心里非常愤怒、非常受伤，其实你已经忘了那位为你而死的那一位——你忘记了他。

诗篇的作者说：“我的心哪，你要称颂耶和华，凡在我里面的，也要称颂他的圣名。我的心哪，你要称颂耶和华，不可忘记他的一切恩惠。”

诗人每天早晨对自己说：“我最大的问题，就是我又忘了他为我做了什么；我忘了他为我担当的那种‘被遗忘’。”

如果你今天在这里，因为被某个人拒绝、被某段关系抛弃而陷入绝望，那说明你忘记了一件事：那位唯一真正重要的、唯一永恒不变的、唯一他的爱永远长存的那一位——此刻正爱着你。因为你那本该落在自己身上的“被遗忘”，已经在十字架上全都倾倒在耶稣身上了。

如果你今天是基督徒，那么你整个人生中最核心的问题，就是你忘了那位“穷人”——你轻视了他、忽略了他。你需要再一次用他为你所成就的一切，重新充满你的心。

你看见了吗？

记住那位“穷人”，你就会永远活着；记住那位“穷人”，你就会被永远爱着。

让我们一起祷告——

主我们的神，我们感谢你，因为你让你的儿子——那位从永远就爱你、认识你的神子——成了那位“穷人”；然后，你在他身上承载了我们所有的“被遗忘”，把我们所有本该承受的离弃都倾倒在他身上。正因为这样，我们今天可以确定：你永不忘记我们。

主啊，说到底，哲学最多只能把我们带到悬崖边，给我们一些理性上的解释，但真正能托住我们、让我们走进这个充满苦难的世界，却既不逃避、也不绝望的，只有对你儿子的认识。

我们感谢你：唯有在十字架那里，我们才得着足够的资源，去面对人生中的各种不公——既不把它静音，也不被它吞没。

我求你，使那些此刻正经历不公和苦难的弟兄姊妹，能更深知道：你的儿子曾为我们承受了什么；好叫我们能饶恕，也能刚强站立。

我也为那些还不认识你儿子是谁的人祈求：愿他们心中那种深沉的绝望——其实正是你圣灵的礼物——能把他们引向十字架，使他们看见他是谁、他为他们做了什么。

奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。
