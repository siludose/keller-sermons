### Introduction: The Search for Meaning

Have you ever found yourself asking, what if nothing I do really lasts, is this all there is? In today's podcast, Tim Keller looks at how Ecclesiastes helps us face our doubts, fears, and uncertainties and points us to the lasting hope and significance we have in Christ.

Let's take a look at this passage. Now, we're about to read from Ecclesiastes and last year, last fall, I did one sermon on Ecclesiastes and ever since then I wanted to come back. And in the month of September, we're going to be looking at some of the basic themes of this book.

And right away, as we read it, you're going to see it's different. It's so different than other books of the Bible, it'll strike you right away. Ecclesiastes chapter 9, we're going to read verses 2 to 16.

> "All share a common destiny, the righteous and the wicked, the good and the bad, the clean and the unclean, those who offer sacrifices and those who do not, as it is with a good man, so with a sinner, as it is with those who take oaths, so with those who are afraid to take them."

**This is the evil and everything that happens under the sun. The same destiny overtakes all.**

### Ecclesiastes and Its Unique Perspective

There's never been a time where in the last few decades, at least in America, maybe even the West, where people have been searching more, doing more spiritual searching. And there's no better place to go do spiritual searching than going to the book of Ecclesiastes.

The word Ecclesiastes is the Latin translation for the Hebrew word for the author. And the Hebrew word, what the author calls himself, is cohaleth, which actually means, it's very hard, a public teacher or a commentator. Some people have actually called him a pundit, a public teacher, a commentator, a person who's commenting on the way things are.

Now, there's no better place to go. If you or you know somebody, no better place to go, if you're on a spiritual search, if you're trying to find faith or trying to find God or trying to find what's out there, there's no better place than the book of Ecclesiastes because in the entire Bible, this is the only book written from the viewpoint of a skeptic.

### The Problem of Injustice

How do you deal with the injustice and the evil and suffering I see in the world? You can't live without asking those questions or essentially answering them, even if you don't think you're answering them, you are answering them.

**He refuses to let you avoid the question of injustice, and then secondly, he gives us two answers, clues to two answers.**

First of all, let me show you, look how he makes sure you do not avoid the question. This is very easy to tune out. In verse 11 and 12, first of all, he's talking about the random general injustice in life.

> "The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise, nor wealth to the brilliant, or favor to the learned, but time and chance happens to all."

### The Cool and Hot Answers

What is that third way? Over the years it seems like increasingly I've found that the Bible's answer boils down to two and I'm going to call them a cool answer and a hot answer. One is an answer for the mind, that's the cool one and one is an answer for the heart, that's the hot one.

**All by themselves they don't work but together they're remarkable.**

The Ecclesiastes writer because he's Ecclesiastes because he's different than any other book in the Bible does not tell you but clue you. He does not let see the Ecclesiastes is not a lecture, it's a seminar.

### Conclusion: Remembering the Poor Man

The Ecclesiastes writer sees a kind of wisdom and he's moved by it and we know why because it's just an echo a pattern of the great wisdom and this is this we do not just have a God who's simply up in heaven and he says I've got reasons why I'm not dealing with evil you're just going to have to accept them.

**The Christian God has done something unbelievable.**

Here's the gospel: We've forgotten God, it is he who has made us but not and not we ourselves we've forgotten him that means we go our own way we doff our hats to him but in general every day we don't remember him we forget him we act as if we're our own gods.

Let's pray we thank you Lord God that because of who you made your son the son of God who loved you forever and knew you forever and then what you did to him you poured out our forgottenness on him because of that we can know that you will never forget us.

### 引言：寻找意义

你是否曾问过自己，如果我所做的一切都不会长久，这就是全部吗？在今天的播客中，Tim Keller 探讨了传道书如何帮助我们面对疑惑、恐惧和不确定性，并指引我们在基督里找到持久的希望和意义。

让我们来看看这段经文。现在，我们即将阅读传道书，去年秋天，我讲了一次关于传道书的讲道，从那时起我就想回到这里。在九月份，我们将探讨这本书的一些基本主题。

一开始，当我们阅读它时，你会发现它与其他圣经书籍不同，这会立刻引起你的注意。我们将阅读传道书第九章，第二到十六节。

> “所有人都有共同的命运，义人和恶人，善良和邪恶，洁净和不洁净，献祭的人和不献祭的人，正如善良的人一样，罪人也是如此，正如那些发誓的人一样，那些害怕发誓的人也是如此。”

**这是在日光之下发生的一切邪恶。相同的命运降临到所有人身上。**

### 传道书及其独特视角

在过去的几十年里，至少在美国，甚至可能在整个西方，人们从未如此努力地寻找精神上的答案。而没有比传道书更好的地方去进行这种精神探索了。

传道书这个词是希伯来文作者的拉丁翻译。希伯来文中，作者称自己为“传道者”，这实际上意味着一个公共教师或评论员。有些人甚至称他为评论员，一个评论事物现状的人。

如果你或你认识的人正在进行精神探索，试图找到信仰或试图找到上帝或试图找到外面的东西，没有比传道书更好的地方了，因为在整本圣经中，这是唯一一本从怀疑者的角度写的书。

### 不公义的问题

你如何处理我在世界上看到的不公义、邪恶和痛苦？你不能生活而不问这些问题或基本上回答它们，即使你不认为你在回答它们，你也在回答它们。

**他拒绝让你回避不公义的问题，然后他给了我们两个答案的线索。**

首先，让我给你看，他如何确保你不回避这个问题。这很容易被忽视。在第十一和十二节中，首先，他在谈论生活中随机的一般不公。

> “比赛不一定是最快的赢，战斗不一定是最强的赢，食物不一定是聪明的人得到，财富不一定是聪明的人得到，恩惠不一定是有学问的人得到，但时间和机会降临到所有人身上。”

### 冷静与热情的答案

那第三种方式是什么？多年来，我发现圣经的答案似乎归结为两种，我将它们称为冷静的答案和热情的答案。一个是给头脑的答案，那是冷静的，一个是给心灵的答案，那是热情的。

**单独来看，它们不起作用，但结合在一起，它们是非凡的。**

传道书的作者因为他是传道书，因为他与圣经中的其他书不同，他不会直接告诉你，而是给你线索。他不会让你看到传道书不是一场讲座，而是一场研讨会。

### 结论：记住那位贫穷的人

传道书的作者看到了一种智慧，他被它感动，我们知道为什么，因为这只是伟大智慧的回声和模式，这就是我们不仅仅有一个简单在天堂的上帝，他说我有理由不处理邪恶，你只需要接受它们。

**基督教的上帝做了一件不可思议的事情。**

这是福音：我们忘记了上帝，是他创造了我们，而不是我们自己，我们忘记了他，这意味着我们走自己的路，我们向他致敬，但通常每天我们不记得他，我们忘记他，我们表现得好像我们是自己的神。

让我们祷告，我们感谢你，主上帝，因为你创造了你的儿子，永远爱你并认识你的上帝之子，然后你对他所做的，你把我们的遗忘倾倒在他身上，因为这样，我们可以知道你永远不会忘记我们。
