## English Transcript / 英文原文

today. I remember when I was in college, one picture that I've never forgotten. He was in 1970 during, I really don't know the history of this,  but I know that during the Cambodian invasion and awful lot of the college campuses in the Northeast United States,  shut down, students boycotted them basically because they wanted to talk about life issues,  but where we were going. And as a result, at least to the campus I was at,  there was open mics on the college quadrangles every day. Anybody could get and speak, crowds of people showed up.

No matter where you were, you saw groups of people together talking about the meaning of life. And one set of students put up a sign. And on the sign, I remember it was black with white letters. And it said, the resurrection of Jesus Christ is intellectually credible and existentially satisfying. And I've come to see over the years that those are the two tests of any valid worldview,  of any valid philosophy, of any valid religion, the two tests.

It has to be both rational, coherent, it has to be true, and it also has to be relevant,  it has to meet my needs, it has to connect with my experience. Now modern people have a tendency when it comes to religion or to philosophy,  not to ask the first question anymore. I mean that really was 1970. Now all we ask is, oh religion, who knows whether it's true or not, does it work for me? Who knows whether it's intellectually credible, I mean after all, everybody's got their own views.

What I want to know is it's essentially satisfying to me. With all their respects, I think that's a dangerous approach. Because we do know something called a placebo effect, you know. A placebo effect is this. If I am sick and I take some medicine that I really believe will make me better.

But I have very serious symptoms, I'm dying of something. There will be a placebo effect if I believe it enough. Some of my symptoms will go away. I will feel better. But in the long run the placebo effect is very deadly.

Because objectively, it can't do anything about my disease. And it might lull me into thinking, I'm fine, I'm okay, I don't have to do anything else. If there is a spiritually objective universe. If I'm not saying that there is right now, I'm not trying to prove it to you. I'm just saying if there was a spiritually objective universe, every bit as objective as the physical universe.

Then to go into a religion or a faith or a worldview or a philosophy and everybody's got a working philosophy. Everybody's got a set of answers to what's wrong with us and where are we going and what is human nature and what is ultimate reality. Everybody's got a working philosophy. If you go at it by saying all it matters is that I believe it, it feels great, it works for me. What if there is a spiritual placebo effect?

What if it makes you feel okay? You know, every single religion, every philosophy, even the craziest and the wildest and the most incoherent can produce people who say,  I have joy in meaning in life now because of my adherence to this wonderful organization. Everybody, anybody can produce that. The mafia can produce that. It's nice to have an income.

It's nice to have brothers, brothers, sort of. What if there's a placebo effect? What if you feel good for a while, but objectively, you're dying of something that this has nothing to do with, that this can't deal with. Don't you see how destructive that would be? Christianity is characterized by a willingness, almost a dare, a challenge to people to say, yes, we're essentially satisfying.

There's millions of people around the world who can say Christianity has helped me. Nobody denies that. That's a fact. But Christianity challenges and says, but it's not just the works essentially satisfying. We're intellectually credible.

We're relevant because we're true. That's not the way the modern mindset goes. The modern mindset is, it's true if it works. Christianity says, oh, don't you see? That'll be a placebo effect.

We only ultimately work if we're true. Don't come to Christianity, says the Bible, because it's relevant, though it certainly is. Don't come to Christianity because it's exciting, though absolutely it is. Don't come to Christianity because it'll meet your needs, though it certainly will. Come because it's true.

And because it's true, it'll meet your needs. It's exciting in this role. And if it's not true, it's a placebo. Now, how do you know Christianity is true? That's quite a challenge.

That's quite a dare, especially to do in a kind of confined period of time tonight. And therefore, what I like to do is give you an overview of the main piece of evidence, which I think is overwhelming and inescapable evidence for the truth of the Christian message. And that is Jesus Christ as datum. Jesus Christ as fat. Who is He?

You see John 9 that you just heard depicted. Jesus deeds were always making people come up with theories. Did you hear the theories? This man is a sinner. Wait a minute, says somebody else.

You know, I've never seen sinners do this kind of thing before. This man is a prophet, but is that enough? And at the end, Jesus Christ says, I'm the one who healed you and the blind man gets down and worships Jesus. Worships. Did you hear that?

Worships. And what does Jesus do? He takes it. He stays put. Who is this guy?

What kind of person would take worship? Huston Smith wrote a great book called The World's Great Religions. It's an old book. It's been around a long time. You know, a staple of religion courses, a terrific book.

The world's great religions. And in that book he says,  there have only been in the history of the world two prominent and influential figures whose lives were so incredible and so tremendous. The data of their lives was so inexplicable that people around them did not just ask, who are they? Who are you? But what are you?

Huston Smith has only two people that really have had influence in the history of the world whose lives were marked with such beauty that people didn't just say, who are you? They asked, what are you? Those two people were Buddha and Jesus. And Smith points out that responses of those two people were completely opposed, completely opposite. In both cases, people wanted to worship them because they'd never seen compassion.

They'd never seen integrity. They'd never seen lives like that. They'd never seen beauty. They'd never seen wisdom. They'd never seen anything like it.

And Smith says, people, what are you? And they wanted to worship. And Buddha said, absolutely, don't worship me. I am not a God. Buddha always and continually said, don't look to me.

Look to my Dharma, my doctrine, my teaching. Don't look at me. Look at my Dharma, my doctrine. Jesus, unequivocally accepted worship. Jesus, not only unequivocally did not say, I'm not God, he unequivocally said, not even I am a God, he said, I'm the God.

And whenever anybody worshiped, when Thomas fell down and said, my Lord, my God, when the blind man worshipped, Jesus stood there and calmly took it. One of the things that is so inexplicable about Jesus is this. There's a lot of people, there's at least 20 people,  that we can say are the most influential people, figures in the history of the world. In fact, Jesus would also probably be in any group of the 10 most influential figures in the world. In fact, you could probably put Jesus in the three.

In fact, it might even be a consensus to say he's the single most influential, but he's in that fraternity. He's in that group. On the other hand, there have also been a number of people who have claimed to be divinity. They've claimed to be God. They've claimed to be divine personages, but there is no overlap between them except one guy.

Because the people who have made claims of divinity have always been unable to convince anyone but a group of marginalized, you know, off-balanced, frag-tag little group of disenfranchised people, that they are God. Oh, there's been dozens of them. I am God, worship me. There's been dozens of them. And they've never convinced anything but a small group of unbalanced people.

On the other hand over here, you've got a whole bunch of people who have been the most influential folks in the history of the world and in almost all cases when they talk about themselves, there's a humility. Don't look to me, says Buddha. Look to my Dharma. They always say, don't worship me. Don't do that.

That's what made them great. That's what made them influential. Except one guy. There's one guy in both categories. One man who not only made incredible claims, but also got people to believe.

And if one of the most influential figures in the history of the world claim to be God himself, claim therefore the absolute allegiance of every human being on the face of the earth. There is no thoughtful person. There's no thoughtful person who can possibly walk away from that without studying it. You can't say I've had a balance and I've a thoughtful approach to life. I'm not a Christian.

I don't believe all that stuff about Jesus being God. But you see, I haven't studied a whole lot. I was raised in it, but I pretty much, you know, I had religion 101. I had philosophy 101. I pretty much realized most of the smart people and most of the cool people around me didn't believe this either.

So I didn't either. Friends, the magnitude of Jesus claims and the magnitude of his impact shows that you better not just doubt that he is not God. God, you better know that he's not God. The magnitude of the claim. Look, what if you got on very official stationery from one of the major law firms in New York City, you got a letter saying please come see us.

You are a long lost heir of the British throne. What is your first reaction? Come on. I'm Chinese. Come on.

It can't be. And yet, you know, you know, you're not even going to make a phone call. I'll give you another one. Let's just say you get official stationery from the IRS and it says you owe us $400,000 in back taxes and you say,  I can't be. I haven't made $40,000.

How could this be? And yet, you see the magnitude of the claim. The magnitude of the claim means that you better not just doubt that it's true. You better know it's not true because if there's a chance, it's true and you miss it, your life is ruined. When Jesus Christ says, I'm the way the truth in the life.

No one comes to ultimate reality, but by me. You better know that that's not true. He was a crackpot. You see, I mean, I don't think everybody has to study the life of David Kuresh because what if he really is who he said he is. There's an awful lot of other people like him that I don't think that we've got that much evidence, you know, to back up his claims.

But here's one, one, one person who's made these kinds of claims and look at the impact of his life. The data, the data of Jesus Christ. Have you looked at it? Now, let me show you what the data is. And then let me show you there only five.

I'm just going to tick through them because this is basically the case. Maybe you've never seen an overall case. The case for Christianity. The case for Jesus being who he said he is. Look at the data and there's only five possible answers, five explanations.

Who is this? I've just shown you that no intelligent person can fail. To look at the data and decide which of these five options you believe. Because if you don't even try, if you just ignore it, if you say, well, I don't know, I haven't looked at it. What's a matter with you?

Your life could be ruined if you're wrong. The magnitude of the claim. Look at the data and there's only five ways to explain it. Here's the data. Number one, there was a man some 2000 years ago in Palestine who claimed to be God, who claimed to be the Messiah, the Son of God from heaven,  who claimed to be bringing the kingdom of heaven to earth.

Number one, number two, as he went about with this message, the people who heard him speak saw him do things that looked like miracles. They saw him apparently feed 5000 people from a little loaf of bread or two. They saw him walk on water. They saw him raise people from the dead. They saw him heal people who are sick.

That's number two. I'm not telling you that he did do miracles. I'm telling you that hundreds of people saw him do apparently what were miracles. It created an incredible sensation. John 9 that you just heard depicted for you is just one example.

Number three, he not only claimed to be God, but he convinced the people who are closest to him, the people who lived with him, the apostles, and so on that he was God. Keeping in mind that the last people on the face of the earth who could possibly believe that a human being could be God would be first century Jews. Because on the east, their understanding of God in the east is God is sort of a life force that's in everybody and everything, so it's not that unusual to say a person is kind of a manifestation of God. On the west, the Romans and the Greeks had this understanding of God's, and there were a lot of gods and they used to take on disguises and they used to appear as human beings to make whoopee for a while. I mean that you can see it in the myths, but the Jews, the Jews had a view of the transcendence of God unmatched in any place else in the world at the time.

The Jews had an understanding of a God who was not just imminent but transcendent, a God who was above the world, who had created the world, who was beginningless. And the Jews had been taught in the first two commandments of the Ten Commandments that have been taught for 2000 years, never, ever, ever worship anything created, never, never worship a calf, never worship the son of the moon, never. They had been instilled in them for years and years and years, they didn't even use the name of God. It was too holy, the last people in the world who would believe that somebody was God would be a group of first century Jews, but not only that, the last people in the world who believe your God are the people who you sleep with. Hey, there's all kinds of these great heroes right, everybody likes them, and then outcomes the people who live with them, somebody gives them a book contract, somebody writes an article.

And this is the reason why there are hundreds of people in this column who believed in God, they were God, who said they were God, but who never had any impact. Why? Because basically there's always somebody who sees the cruelty, somebody who sees the selfishness. Somebody who sees the duplicity, somebody who sees the hypocrisy, the last people who you'll ever get to believe that this person is God, are the people who you live with, who you sleep with, who you work with. Fact number three, the group of people surrounding Jesus Christ, not only heard his claims to be God, they believed it.

Number four, after he died, dozens and hundreds of people confessed and attested that they saw him risen. Not only did all the apostles, but we know that at least 500 people at one time, Paul tells us this in the book of 1 Corinthians, we'll get to that in a second. At one time, saw him risen. That's fact number four, dozens, dozens of people. Sometimes hundreds at a time said, I've seen him, he's not dead, he's risen.

Fact number five, the experience of that changed those men and women's lives so much that they went out into the world and they died to spread the news. Many of them sacrificed tremendously. Many of them suffered a martyr's death, but they were so completely transformed that they went everywhere and they spread the faith all around the Mediterranean five things. There was a man who claimed to be God, he did apparently miracles, he got the people close to him to believe that he was God. After he was dead, many people saw him risen and those people were so transformed by the experience of meeting that risen savior that they spread the word everywhere.

How do you account for the facts? How do you account? How do you account for the data who he is? You got to come up with something and there's only five possibilities and I'll just tick through them. I will tell you, the first two are impossible.

The first two options are impossible. I won't even say impossible because I'll call them options. There's five options, the first two are impossible, the second two are improbable, the last one's inescapable. They all start with I. The first two, the first two, the first one.

Most people in New York get out from under the data this way so I've got at least spent a couple minutes on this. Most people say he's a legend. We don't know that any of that happened. That's the average way that New York people get out from under it. Here's what I mean.

In other words, I come to you like I said and many of you here tonight, I'm hoping that afterwards we can talk and have a question answer time after the program is over and so on. You might come back with me at this but I would say most people I would say how do you account for that data and you say how do we know who Jesus was? How do we know he claimed to be God? How do we know he did parent miracles? How do we know all these things?

Don't you know that Jesus Christ like any charismatic individual? His followers were amazed with him and so after he died they began to weave tales about him and weave stories about him. And you know you played whisper down the alley having you you know you say it to one person next person and over the years these tales became embellished. And the early church began to put into these tales they began to make up stories and they began to put words in Jesus' mouth that met their needs. And so finally they were written down in the New Testament many years after but they were written by the people who were Christians, they weren't their biased people.

They wrote these things down many years later and so we have no idea what Jesus really said. We don't know which of these things are genuine, we don't know which of these accounts is genuine, you can't read the New Testament history. He was a legend that's how I get out from under the data. Let me just give you actually three reasons that can't be. And this would be a great talk on itself but I just have to give you three reasons why it can't be.

Number one, the Bible is not written as legend, the Bible's written as history. A lot of people like to say, well you know, I mean look at the legends around Buddha, look at the Buddhist writings, look at the Korean, look at these writings but here's a difference. When you go, for example, to the New Testament, you go to take a look at the gospel of Luke. And in the very beginning of the gospel of Luke, Luke says this. He says many others have drawn up accounts of Jesus' life just as they were handed down to us by the eyewitnesses.

So I have made a careful investigation of everything from the beginning and I've written an orderly account so that you may know the certainty of these things. How would he say? He is saying look, I wasn't an eyewitness, but I know a lot of the eyewitnesses. So I have carefully gone and interviewed the eyewitnesses. This is a guy writing like an investigative journalist.

He says I went and I interviewed the eyewitnesses. I've compared the various accounts. I have woven them together into an orderly account so you can be certain that these things happen. Another critic, a literary critic puts it this way. He says when you read the New Testament, you can see right away the gospels are not written as legends.

In one sense, he says they're not good enough. And that, listen, and he's trying to say they're not good enough. Here's what he means. He says if they are not history, then they would have to be realistic prose fiction of a kind which actually never existed before the 18th century. Little episodes like in John 8, Jesus writing in the dust when they brought him the woman taken into adultery.

Those little kinds of things that have no particular significance in the story at all are the mark. See what he's saying? He says today we have fiction that's like the novel. That's realistic prose fiction. It goes into detail.

It says she came to the door. She turned the knob. You know, it creeps. That's the way we write fiction now. This person said if the gospels with all of their detail, with little statements like when Jesus received the woman called adultery, he was writing in the sand.

Doesn't tell us what he was writing. It has nothing to do with the plot. Nothing to do with the story. Legends don't put those kinds of little details in. The critic is saying they didn't write fiction like that.

Luke says this is not a legend. Luke doesn't write it as a legend. And therefore, when you read the New Testament gospels, you have to assume that they are either absolutely deliberate intentional hoaxes. They're lies or their historical accounts. There is no in between.

Are you ready to say that? Now, that's the first step. And getting rid of this idea that Jesus was a legend because the second step is this. They're either history or their lies. If their lies try these two things on.

Up to about 1900, many scholars said, ah, you know the gospels, they weren't written until 100 years after the events. Research and archaeology over the last 80 years has pushed it back, pushed it back, pushed it back. So all scholars now will say that the gospels were written around 70 AD. And you know, you have the epistles of Paul were written within 20 years after the events. And this is what's in that mean.

It means something very important. If you're going to fabricate. If you're going to create stories and say this happened and this mountain and this happened and this happened in this year and this happened in this year,  the only way you're going to get that to fly is if you wait till all the eyewitnesses are dead. In 1970, on my college campus, when we shut down the place so that we could debate the Cambodian vision and the morality of it,  nobody was going around with a camcorder. I didn't think we had them.

We did have movies, but we didn't have camcorders. Nobody sat around and made an account. So there's really no historical accounts. But if I decided now, 23 years later, which is as long after the events of Jesus' life as Paul was when he was writing his epistles,  if I decided to write that there was a riot on my college campus during the strike and that seven or eight people were killed,  that would never get off the ground. There's just too many people around who are alive, some of them are dead, but most of them are alive.

And they would say, what are you talking about? I read the review of this book and the New York Times book review, forget it. They can't be. They'd be up in arms, out they'd come. If you want to fabricate something, you've got to wait until after all the eyewitnesses are dead,  so there's no possibility of corroboration or contradiction.

All of the New Testament documents, just about all that we know, were written within the lifetime of the eyewitnesses. How could they be absolute and total intentional lies? Paul says in Thessalonians 15, 500 people saw Jesus Christ raised from the dead at one time. They saw him alive. He wrote that 20 to 25 years, everybody agrees with this, all scholars agree, after the event.

Here's a public letter. This is public knowledge. How could a faith be based on these kinds of accounts when there would have been hundreds of people back there who could have said,  what do you mean the tomb is not empty? Look, there's the tomb. What do you mean those things never happen?

Where are these 500 people? I don't know if any of them. Could it, you see, it's Campy Legend, it's either a lie or it's historical document. And does it make sense that it is a lie? Not, you know, not because it was written too early, but lastly, do people die for hoax?

Think of the disciples. All of them would have been had to be in tremendous conspiracy. Do they die for hoax? Kenneth Scott Latteret, who was a tremendous historian, lived and he worked at Yale, he put it this way, at one point. He says, why among all the cults and philosophies competing in the Greco-Roman world, did Christianity succeed and outstrip all others?

Why did it succeed despite getting more severe opposition than any other? Why did it succeed though it had no influential backers and high places, but consisted mainly of the poor and slaves? How did it succeed so completely that it forced the most powerful state in history to come to terms with it and then outlive the very empire that sought to uproot it? It is clear, he concludes, that at the very beginning of Christianity there must have occurred a vast release of energy, perhaps unequal in our history,  without it the future course of the Christian religion is inexplicable. It is a possibility that all these people died for a lie, maybe possible, absolutely, but put that together with the idea of when it was written.

The Christian faith on the basis of these claims could never have gotten off the ground. They couldn't have said the tomb is empty unless the tomb wasn't empty because of when they were saying it. They couldn't have said, people saw Jesus raised from the dead unless they had seen Him raised from the dead because those people were still there. They couldn't have talked about the miracles. They couldn't have said, this Jesus claimed to be the Son of God unless He had claimed to be the Son of God.

I'm sorry, you can't say. He's a legend. You can't say. Well, somebody says, if I keep reading newspaper accounts, if it says scholars say we have no idea what Jesus Christ is actually, what Jesus Christ really taught and what He said. Yeah, I know.

By the way, they very often put themselves forward as mainstream historians and they're not. They're very, very skeptical and let me just put it this way. If you doubt on the basis of historical evidence that Jesus Christ didn't said all these things, you have to doubt and you have to say we can't know anything from the past. You have far more, far more evidence that Jesus Christ didn't said these things than you have evidence that Caesar invaded Gaul. Far more.

We only have one account of that. We have four accounts of this. The only account we have is a manuscript, the earliest copy, 900 years after the event. The gospels we have, we have manuscripts from just within a few years after they were written, but here's the difference. There's a bias.

When you study Caesar's Gallic Wars, you don't sit down and say, I wonder if this is true because if it is, it'll change the way in which I have to live. It doesn't matter whether Caesar's Gallic Wars are true or not. Not the way you have to live, but who in the world can come to the gospel and see the account and be objective. Don't you know what is wrong with saying, ah, yes, as a scholar, I can read the New Testament objectively. You can't.

Nobody can. Nobody can. Because if it's true, unlike Caesar's Gallic Wars, you will have to change the way you live tomorrow. You have lost control of your life if it's true. You've got to do what he says.

You've got to live your life for him. You can't live the way you feel is right or wrong. You have to find out what he says. You have to follow him. Who in the world could possibly be objective studying that?

Imagine a judge and she's about to hear a case about a particular company and the prosecution is trying to say this company is guilty of fraud. What if that judge was a major investor in that company? What if that judge, if the company was found to be fraudulent, would lose thousands of dollars? Common sense and the laws of this land would say she has a vested interest, she's conflict of interest, she cannot hear the case. But when you read the Bible and you sit down and say one of these things are true or not, you have even more conflict of interest than she does.

If this is found to be true, you stand to lose control of your whole life. And if you know that you've got that conflict of interest but you have to study it anyway and you have to make a decision, there's no other way around it. You better make sure that you double and triple check every one of your doubts because they could be prejudice. You have to double and triple check every one of your bits of skepticism because you know you have a tremendous motive to not believe it. And that's the reason why I would tell you, so many scholars will be skeptical of the historical account of Jesus and won't be skeptical of what Caesars got like wars, Herodotus, all those accounts, waitonious and so on.

He's not a legend. Now if he's not a legend and the second impossible option is he couldn't be a good man, he couldn't be. Do you know what he says? Have you read what he says? People like to say, oh, but he was just a fine teacher.

How could he be a fine teacher? He says, I'm the way the truth in the life. No one comes to the Father but by me. He says, if you want to follow me, if you want to be my disciple you have to hate your Father and Mother. He says, anyone who wants to lose his life, save his life will lose it, but anyone who will lose his life for my sake will find it.

He says, all power is given unto me and low I'm with you always the end of the earth. You know what he's saying? Let me just give it to you in modern language. He says, I'm the only way to ultimate reality. I am the ultimate reality.

He says, if you want to follow me, you have got to give me everything. Your love for me must be so high that your love for anything else, even parents and children and spouses has to look like hate in comparison. If there's anything keeping you from me, if it's an eye, throw it away, pluck it out. If it's a hand, cut it off. Get rid of it.

It's not worth losing me. All reality, all the universe will bow to me. All things will bow to me and all things will bow to you if you come to me. Who has ever said things like this before? I'll tell you one thing, no good person would say this.

This person is either God or he's on the level of a poached egg, a man who says he's a poached egg. He's either God or he's a terrible liar, but he can't be a good man. Reject him, hate him, assassinate him. But none of this nonsense that he's a good man. He's not a legend, he's not a good man.

Then we say, ah, well, maybe he was a liar or maybe he was a lunatic. But there's a couple of problems with both of those and I'll just treat them together to get to the end. Mainly because both the liar option and the lunatic option are both the same option. In other words, you're saying he fooled his followers. He was either a very bad person like the Pharisee said in John 9, or he was really a lunatic.

We've got a bit of a problem there. Here's why. For example, look at the quality of his teaching. It's not the ravings of a madman. GK Chester didn't put it this way.

If I found a key on the road and discovered it fit and opened a particular lock. If I found a key on the road and discovered it fit and opened a particular lock at my house,  I'd assume most likely that the key was made by the lock maker. And if I find a set of teachings set out in pre-modern Oriental society that has proven itself of such universal validity,  that it has fascinated and satisfied millions of people in every century, including the best minds in history and the simplest hearts. That it has made itself at home in virtually every culture, inspired masterpieces of beauty in every field of art,  continues to go rapidly and spread and assert itself in lands where a century ago the name of Jesus Christ was not even heard. If such teaching so obviously fits the locks of so many human souls in so many times and so many places,  are they likely to be the work of a deceiver or a fool?

In fact, it is more likely that they were designed by the heart maker. Well, then take a look at his life. Look at his life. We see the account. Is that life a life of a liar or a lunatic?

Someone's put it this way. No one has ever yet discovered the word Jesus ought to have said. The account. You try to come up with a better line. Do you realize what kind of person you have to be to even make this up?

If somebody made this up, we would have to be sitting here having the same kind of discussion over who is this incredible person who made it up? What kind of person would this be? No one has ever yet discovered the word Jesus ought to have said or the deed he ought to have done. Nothing he does falls short. In fact, he is always surprising you and taking your breath away because he's better than you could imagine.

Why? They are the surprises of perfection. He combined virtues never seen together, tenderness without weakness, strength without harshness, humility without the slightest lack of confidence,  holiness and unbending convictions without the slightest lack of approachability, power without insensitivity, passion without prejudice,  the harshest judgment on the self-satisfied, yet the most winsome kindness to the broken and the marginal, never inconsistent, never a false step, never a drawing note. P.T. Forsyth said,  If God be not thus, he is less than the God we crave and less than the God the world needs.

This is the holy love that deserves to be almighty. Listen, when we describe it, we're done. When we describe it, even describing it, can't you begin to feel a little bit of what they saw? The reason they got down and worshipped him? You can see it when you read the gospels.

You can see it as we just described it. They felt they knew that they were looking through the substance of a human flesh, the very being of God. The last people in the world who would believe this were 1st century Jews. What power could have gotten them to believe it? What's the alternative?

St. Thomas Aquinas put it this way. He says the only alternative is to believe even greater miracle. And that greater miracle would be, if Jesus Christ did not happen and even more unbelievable miracle happened,  the conversion of one half of the Roman world and their moral transformation into unsolficionist and new heights of holiness all by the biggest lie in history. What's the inescapable option?

Not a legend, can't be a good man, those are the impossible ones. The improbable ones, a deceiver or delusional. Where does it bring us? It brings us to this place. If you get rid of your bias against this possible supernatural,  if you get rid of your bias against the idea of a miracle,  if you get rid of that bias, it's hard to believe who he said he is, but it's harder not to.

It's difficult to believe who he said he is, but the theories that you have to adhere to in order to get out from it are even more species and have even more holes. And as a result, we come to the final and we say he must be who he said he is. If that's true, it means number one. It means that there is no way that you have really met the real Jesus unless your reaction to him has been extreme. If there's anybody in this room who doesn't hate him or on the other hand, fear him.

I think he's the most dangerous person that ever lived or on the other hand, there's three hands on this man here. Or on the other hand, love him, adore him and he's thrown over everything to follow him. Those are the only three alternative responses that are rational. Don't you see? Because of his claims.

You should either hate him and attack him or you should fear him and run from him or you should love him and bow down before him. But if you have said, well, I don't know what I think or I think I'm a Christian. I wish I was a better Christian. I don't know if I'm a Christian. You don't know who he is.

You have never seen the real Jesus. You're responding to a figment of your imagination. Get real. Lastly, if Jesus is who he said he is, it's great news. You know why?

Because he's saying morality and goodness is not the way. See, Buddha says, I am not God. Look to my teaching. If you just live a good life, that'll be enough. But if on the other hand, if on the other hand, if on the other hand, you see Jesus who says, don't look to my teaching.

Look to me. Buddha says, I'm not God. I show you the way to God. Jesus says, I'm God come to you. You will never be good enough.

You will never be moral enough to reach God. I have come to live the life you should have lived. I've come to die the death. You should have died to pay for your sins. I've come all the way.

Believe in me. See, Buddha says, this is the way. Jesus says, I am the way. Buddha says, I can show you the way to God. Jesus says, get real.

You'll never get there. You'll never be good enough. I'm God come to you. That's good news. If you understand what I just said, and you're not a Christian tonight, you better ask yourself, since I have lots and lots and lots of conflict of interest, I have lots and lots and lots of fears that make me prejudice against the truth of it, please agree tonight to explore.

Some of you think everything I said is silly. I hope you come back some other time anyway. I hope you'll think about it. Some of you are surprised. Some of you say, I need to study more.

Some of you are saying, I need to get more into this. My stereotypes have been shattered a little bit. I've gotten new ideas to think about. I'm convicted in some ways. I would like you, if you can, after the service is done, to stick around for a question and answer time, and or go to the welcome table afterwards, out front, get a little blue piece of paper that will give you a book called, Who Is This Jesus?

This is for people who want to know. People who aren't sure who he is. People who are guests tonight, go out, fill out one of those forms, take it downstairs these lounge, and you'll get a free book of the same title of the talk tonight. What we're going to do now, I'm going to pray, we're going to hear a piece of music, and right after that I'm going to take just two or three questions from people to get our question and answer time started. Then I'll dismiss all of you and the people who need to stay can stay up front here and we'll have a question and answer time right afterwards.

Let me pray with you. Our Father, we close this time with prayer because we know that like Jesus said to the Pharisees, because you don't think you're blind, you're very blind. And because you haven't admitted that you don't see, you don't see. But if you admit you don't see, you begin to see. And if you admit your prejudice, you're losing your prejudices, I pray that your spirit will help people to see that they don't see, so that they can begin to see.

And you will get people here, a Holy Spirit, to help people to see their prejudices so they can drop their prejudices so that we can see whether or not Jesus Christ is existentially satisfying and intellectually credible. I ask that your spirit would help everybody here to see that in Jesus name we pray. Amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today. I remember when I was in college, one picture that I've never forgotten. He was in 1970 during, I really don't know the history of this,  but I know that during the Cambodian invasion and awful lot of the college campuses in the Northeast United States,  shut down, students boycotted them basically because they wanted to talk about life issues,  but where we were going. And as a result, at least to the campus I was at,  there was open mics on the college quadrangles every day. Anybody could get and speak, crowds of people showed up.

No matter where you were, you saw groups of people together talking about the meaning of life. And one set of students put up a sign. And on the sign, I remember it was black with white letters. And it said, the resurrection of Jesus Christ is intellectually credible and existentially satisfying. And I've come to see over the years that those are the two tests of any valid worldview,  of any valid philosophy, of any valid religion, the two tests.

It has to be both rational, coherent, it has to be true, and it also has to be relevant,  it has to meet my needs, it has to connect with my experience. Now modern people have a tendency when it comes to religion or to philosophy,  not to ask the first question anymore. I mean that really was 1970. Now all we ask is, oh religion, who knows whether it's true or not, does it work for me? Who knows whether it's intellectually credible, I mean after all, everybody's got their own views.

What I want to know is it's essentially satisfying to me. With all their respects, I think that's a dangerous approach. Because we do know something called a placebo effect, you know. A placebo effect is this. If I am sick and I take some medicine that I really believe will make me better.

But I have very serious symptoms, I'm dying of something. There will be a placebo effect if I believe it enough. Some of my symptoms will go away. I will feel better. But in the long run the placebo effect is very deadly.

Because objectively, it can't do anything about my disease. And it might lull me into thinking, I'm fine, I'm okay, I don't have to do anything else. If there is a spiritually objective universe. If I'm not saying that there is right now, I'm not trying to prove it to you. I'm just saying if there was a spiritually objective universe, every bit as objective as the physical universe.

Then to go into a religion or a faith or a worldview or a philosophy and everybody's got a working philosophy. Everybody's got a set of answers to what's wrong with us and where are we going and what is human nature and what is ultimate reality. Everybody's got a working philosophy. If you go at it by saying all it matters is that I believe it, it feels great, it works for me. What if there is a spiritual placebo effect?

What if it makes you feel okay? You know, every single religion, every philosophy, even the craziest and the wildest and the most incoherent can produce people who say,  I have joy in meaning in life now because of my adherence to this wonderful organization. Everybody, anybody can produce that. The mafia can produce that. It's nice to have an income.

It's nice to have brothers, brothers, sort of. What if there's a placebo effect? What if you feel good for a while, but objectively, you're dying of something that this has nothing to do with, that this can't deal with. Don't you see how destructive that would be? Christianity is characterized by a willingness, almost a dare, a challenge to people to say, yes, we're essentially satisfying.

There's millions of people around the world who can say Christianity has helped me. Nobody denies that. That's a fact. But Christianity challenges and says, but it's not just the works essentially satisfying. We're intellectually credible.

We're relevant because we're true. That's not the way the modern mindset goes. The modern mindset is, it's true if it works. Christianity says, oh, don't you see? That'll be a placebo effect.

We only ultimately work if we're true. Don't come to Christianity, says the Bible, because it's relevant, though it certainly is. Don't come to Christianity because it's exciting, though absolutely it is. Don't come to Christianity because it'll meet your needs, though it certainly will. Come because it's true.

And because it's true, it'll meet your needs. It's exciting in this role. And if it's not true, it's a placebo. Now, how do you know Christianity is true? That's quite a challenge.

That's quite a dare, especially to do in a kind of confined period of time tonight. And therefore, what I like to do is give you an overview of the main piece of evidence, which I think is overwhelming and inescapable evidence for the truth of the Christian message. And that is Jesus Christ as datum. Jesus Christ as fat. Who is He?

You see John 9 that you just heard depicted. Jesus deeds were always making people come up with theories. Did you hear the theories? This man is a sinner. Wait a minute, says somebody else.

You know, I've never seen sinners do this kind of thing before. This man is a prophet, but is that enough? And at the end, Jesus Christ says, I'm the one who healed you and the blind man gets down and worships Jesus. Worships. Did you hear that?

Worships. And what does Jesus do? He takes it. He stays put. Who is this guy?

What kind of person would take worship? Huston Smith wrote a great book called The World's Great Religions. It's an old book. It's been around a long time. You know, a staple of religion courses, a terrific book.

The world's great religions. And in that book he says,  there have only been in the history of the world two prominent and influential figures whose lives were so incredible and so tremendous. The data of their lives was so inexplicable that people around them did not just ask, who are they? Who are you? But what are you?

Huston Smith has only two people that really have had influence in the history of the world whose lives were marked with such beauty that people didn't just say, who are you? They asked, what are you? Those two people were Buddha and Jesus. And Smith points out that responses of those two people were completely opposed, completely opposite. In both cases, people wanted to worship them because they'd never seen compassion.

They'd never seen integrity. They'd never seen lives like that. They'd never seen beauty. They'd never seen wisdom. They'd never seen anything like it.

And Smith says, people, what are you? And they wanted to worship. And Buddha said, absolutely, don't worship me. I am not a God. Buddha always and continually said, don't look to me.

Look to my Dharma, my doctrine, my teaching. Don't look at me. Look at my Dharma, my doctrine. Jesus, unequivocally accepted worship. Jesus, not only unequivocally did not say, I'm not God, he unequivocally said, not even I am a God, he said, I'm the God.

And whenever anybody worshiped, when Thomas fell down and said, my Lord, my God, when the blind man worshipped, Jesus stood there and calmly took it. One of the things that is so inexplicable about Jesus is this. There's a lot of people, there's at least 20 people,  that we can say are the most influential people, figures in the history of the world. In fact, Jesus would also probably be in any group of the 10 most influential figures in the world. In fact, you could probably put Jesus in the three.

In fact, it might even be a consensus to say he's the single most influential, but he's in that fraternity. He's in that group. On the other hand, there have also been a number of people who have claimed to be divinity. They've claimed to be God. They've claimed to be divine personages, but there is no overlap between them except one guy.

Because the people who have made claims of divinity have always been unable to convince anyone but a group of marginalized, you know, off-balanced, frag-tag little group of disenfranchised people, that they are God. Oh, there's been dozens of them. I am God, worship me. There's been dozens of them. And they've never convinced anything but a small group of unbalanced people.

On the other hand over here, you've got a whole bunch of people who have been the most influential folks in the history of the world and in almost all cases when they talk about themselves, there's a humility. Don't look to me, says Buddha. Look to my Dharma. They always say, don't worship me. Don't do that.

That's what made them great. That's what made them influential. Except one guy. There's one guy in both categories. One man who not only made incredible claims, but also got people to believe.

And if one of the most influential figures in the history of the world claim to be God himself, claim therefore the absolute allegiance of every human being on the face of the earth. There is no thoughtful person. There's no thoughtful person who can possibly walk away from that without studying it. You can't say I've had a balance and I've a thoughtful approach to life. I'm not a Christian.

I don't believe all that stuff about Jesus being God. But you see, I haven't studied a whole lot. I was raised in it, but I pretty much, you know, I had religion 101. I had philosophy 101. I pretty much realized most of the smart people and most of the cool people around me didn't believe this either.

So I didn't either. Friends, the magnitude of Jesus claims and the magnitude of his impact shows that you better not just doubt that he is not God. God, you better know that he's not God. The magnitude of the claim. Look, what if you got on very official stationery from one of the major law firms in New York City, you got a letter saying please come see us.

You are a long lost heir of the British throne. What is your first reaction? Come on. I'm Chinese. Come on.

It can't be. And yet, you know, you know, you're not even going to make a phone call. I'll give you another one. Let's just say you get official stationery from the IRS and it says you owe us $400,000 in back taxes and you say,  I can't be. I haven't made $40,000.

How could this be? And yet, you see the magnitude of the claim. The magnitude of the claim means that you better not just doubt that it's true. You better know it's not true because if there's a chance, it's true and you miss it, your life is ruined. When Jesus Christ says, I'm the way the truth in the life.

No one comes to ultimate reality, but by me. You better know that that's not true. He was a crackpot. You see, I mean, I don't think everybody has to study the life of David Kuresh because what if he really is who he said he is. There's an awful lot of other people like him that I don't think that we've got that much evidence, you know, to back up his claims.

But here's one, one, one person who's made these kinds of claims and look at the impact of his life. The data, the data of Jesus Christ. Have you looked at it? Now, let me show you what the data is. And then let me show you there only five.

I'm just going to tick through them because this is basically the case. Maybe you've never seen an overall case. The case for Christianity. The case for Jesus being who he said he is. Look at the data and there's only five possible answers, five explanations.

Who is this? I've just shown you that no intelligent person can fail. To look at the data and decide which of these five options you believe. Because if you don't even try, if you just ignore it, if you say, well, I don't know, I haven't looked at it. What's a matter with you?

Your life could be ruined if you're wrong. The magnitude of the claim. Look at the data and there's only five ways to explain it. Here's the data. Number one, there was a man some 2000 years ago in Palestine who claimed to be God, who claimed to be the Messiah, the Son of God from heaven,  who claimed to be bringing the kingdom of heaven to earth.

Number one, number two, as he went about with this message, the people who heard him speak saw him do things that looked like miracles. They saw him apparently feed 5000 people from a little loaf of bread or two. They saw him walk on water. They saw him raise people from the dead. They saw him heal people who are sick.

That's number two. I'm not telling you that he did do miracles. I'm telling you that hundreds of people saw him do apparently what were miracles. It created an incredible sensation. John 9 that you just heard depicted for you is just one example.

Number three, he not only claimed to be God, but he convinced the people who are closest to him, the people who lived with him, the apostles, and so on that he was God. Keeping in mind that the last people on the face of the earth who could possibly believe that a human being could be God would be first century Jews. Because on the east, their understanding of God in the east is God is sort of a life force that's in everybody and everything, so it's not that unusual to say a person is kind of a manifestation of God. On the west, the Romans and the Greeks had this understanding of God's, and there were a lot of gods and they used to take on disguises and they used to appear as human beings to make whoopee for a while. I mean that you can see it in the myths, but the Jews, the Jews had a view of the transcendence of God unmatched in any place else in the world at the time.

The Jews had an understanding of a God who was not just imminent but transcendent, a God who was above the world, who had created the world, who was beginningless. And the Jews had been taught in the first two commandments of the Ten Commandments that have been taught for 2000 years, never, ever, ever worship anything created, never, never worship a calf, never worship the son of the moon, never. They had been instilled in them for years and years and years, they didn't even use the name of God. It was too holy, the last people in the world who would believe that somebody was God would be a group of first century Jews, but not only that, the last people in the world who believe your God are the people who you sleep with. Hey, there's all kinds of these great heroes right, everybody likes them, and then outcomes the people who live with them, somebody gives them a book contract, somebody writes an article.

And this is the reason why there are hundreds of people in this column who believed in God, they were God, who said they were God, but who never had any impact. Why? Because basically there's always somebody who sees the cruelty, somebody who sees the selfishness. Somebody who sees the duplicity, somebody who sees the hypocrisy, the last people who you'll ever get to believe that this person is God, are the people who you live with, who you sleep with, who you work with. Fact number three, the group of people surrounding Jesus Christ, not only heard his claims to be God, they believed it.

Number four, after he died, dozens and hundreds of people confessed and attested that they saw him risen. Not only did all the apostles, but we know that at least 500 people at one time, Paul tells us this in the book of 1 Corinthians, we'll get to that in a second. At one time, saw him risen. That's fact number four, dozens, dozens of people. Sometimes hundreds at a time said, I've seen him, he's not dead, he's risen.

Fact number five, the experience of that changed those men and women's lives so much that they went out into the world and they died to spread the news. Many of them sacrificed tremendously. Many of them suffered a martyr's death, but they were so completely transformed that they went everywhere and they spread the faith all around the Mediterranean five things. There was a man who claimed to be God, he did apparently miracles, he got the people close to him to believe that he was God. After he was dead, many people saw him risen and those people were so transformed by the experience of meeting that risen savior that they spread the word everywhere.

How do you account for the facts? How do you account? How do you account for the data who he is? You got to come up with something and there's only five possibilities and I'll just tick through them. I will tell you, the first two are impossible.

The first two options are impossible. I won't even say impossible because I'll call them options. There's five options, the first two are impossible, the second two are improbable, the last one's inescapable. They all start with I. The first two, the first two, the first one.

Most people in New York get out from under the data this way so I've got at least spent a couple minutes on this. Most people say he's a legend. We don't know that any of that happened. That's the average way that New York people get out from under it. Here's what I mean.

In other words, I come to you like I said and many of you here tonight, I'm hoping that afterwards we can talk and have a question answer time after the program is over and so on. You might come back with me at this but I would say most people I would say how do you account for that data and you say how do we know who Jesus was? How do we know he claimed to be God? How do we know he did parent miracles? How do we know all these things?

Don't you know that Jesus Christ like any charismatic individual? His followers were amazed with him and so after he died they began to weave tales about him and weave stories about him. And you know you played whisper down the alley having you you know you say it to one person next person and over the years these tales became embellished. And the early church began to put into these tales they began to make up stories and they began to put words in Jesus' mouth that met their needs. And so finally they were written down in the New Testament many years after but they were written by the people who were Christians, they weren't their biased people.

They wrote these things down many years later and so we have no idea what Jesus really said. We don't know which of these things are genuine, we don't know which of these accounts is genuine, you can't read the New Testament history. He was a legend that's how I get out from under the data. Let me just give you actually three reasons that can't be. And this would be a great talk on itself but I just have to give you three reasons why it can't be.

Number one, the Bible is not written as legend, the Bible's written as history. A lot of people like to say, well you know, I mean look at the legends around Buddha, look at the Buddhist writings, look at the Korean, look at these writings but here's a difference. When you go, for example, to the New Testament, you go to take a look at the gospel of Luke. And in the very beginning of the gospel of Luke, Luke says this. He says many others have drawn up accounts of Jesus' life just as they were handed down to us by the eyewitnesses.

So I have made a careful investigation of everything from the beginning and I've written an orderly account so that you may know the certainty of these things. How would he say? He is saying look, I wasn't an eyewitness, but I know a lot of the eyewitnesses. So I have carefully gone and interviewed the eyewitnesses. This is a guy writing like an investigative journalist.

He says I went and I interviewed the eyewitnesses. I've compared the various accounts. I have woven them together into an orderly account so you can be certain that these things happen. Another critic, a literary critic puts it this way. He says when you read the New Testament, you can see right away the gospels are not written as legends.

In one sense, he says they're not good enough. And that, listen, and he's trying to say they're not good enough. Here's what he means. He says if they are not history, then they would have to be realistic prose fiction of a kind which actually never existed before the 18th century. Little episodes like in John 8, Jesus writing in the dust when they brought him the woman taken into adultery.

Those little kinds of things that have no particular significance in the story at all are the mark. See what he's saying? He says today we have fiction that's like the novel. That's realistic prose fiction. It goes into detail.

It says she came to the door. She turned the knob. You know, it creeps. That's the way we write fiction now. This person said if the gospels with all of their detail, with little statements like when Jesus received the woman called adultery, he was writing in the sand.

Doesn't tell us what he was writing. It has nothing to do with the plot. Nothing to do with the story. Legends don't put those kinds of little details in. The critic is saying they didn't write fiction like that.

Luke says this is not a legend. Luke doesn't write it as a legend. And therefore, when you read the New Testament gospels, you have to assume that they are either absolutely deliberate intentional hoaxes. They're lies or their historical accounts. There is no in between.

Are you ready to say that? Now, that's the first step. And getting rid of this idea that Jesus was a legend because the second step is this. They're either history or their lies. If their lies try these two things on.

Up to about 1900, many scholars said, ah, you know the gospels, they weren't written until 100 years after the events. Research and archaeology over the last 80 years has pushed it back, pushed it back, pushed it back. So all scholars now will say that the gospels were written around 70 AD. And you know, you have the epistles of Paul were written within 20 years after the events. And this is what's in that mean.

It means something very important. If you're going to fabricate. If you're going to create stories and say this happened and this mountain and this happened and this happened in this year and this happened in this year,  the only way you're going to get that to fly is if you wait till all the eyewitnesses are dead. In 1970, on my college campus, when we shut down the place so that we could debate the Cambodian vision and the morality of it,  nobody was going around with a camcorder. I didn't think we had them.

We did have movies, but we didn't have camcorders. Nobody sat around and made an account. So there's really no historical accounts. But if I decided now, 23 years later, which is as long after the events of Jesus' life as Paul was when he was writing his epistles,  if I decided to write that there was a riot on my college campus during the strike and that seven or eight people were killed,  that would never get off the ground. There's just too many people around who are alive, some of them are dead, but most of them are alive.

And they would say, what are you talking about? I read the review of this book and the New York Times book review, forget it. They can't be. They'd be up in arms, out they'd come. If you want to fabricate something, you've got to wait until after all the eyewitnesses are dead,  so there's no possibility of corroboration or contradiction.

All of the New Testament documents, just about all that we know, were written within the lifetime of the eyewitnesses. How could they be absolute and total intentional lies? Paul says in Thessalonians 15, 500 people saw Jesus Christ raised from the dead at one time. They saw him alive. He wrote that 20 to 25 years, everybody agrees with this, all scholars agree, after the event.

Here's a public letter. This is public knowledge. How could a faith be based on these kinds of accounts when there would have been hundreds of people back there who could have said,  what do you mean the tomb is not empty? Look, there's the tomb. What do you mean those things never happen?

Where are these 500 people? I don't know if any of them. Could it, you see, it's Campy Legend, it's either a lie or it's historical document. And does it make sense that it is a lie? Not, you know, not because it was written too early, but lastly, do people die for hoax?

Think of the disciples. All of them would have been had to be in tremendous conspiracy. Do they die for hoax? Kenneth Scott Latteret, who was a tremendous historian, lived and he worked at Yale, he put it this way, at one point. He says, why among all the cults and philosophies competing in the Greco-Roman world, did Christianity succeed and outstrip all others?

Why did it succeed despite getting more severe opposition than any other? Why did it succeed though it had no influential backers and high places, but consisted mainly of the poor and slaves? How did it succeed so completely that it forced the most powerful state in history to come to terms with it and then outlive the very empire that sought to uproot it? It is clear, he concludes, that at the very beginning of Christianity there must have occurred a vast release of energy, perhaps unequal in our history,  without it the future course of the Christian religion is inexplicable. It is a possibility that all these people died for a lie, maybe possible, absolutely, but put that together with the idea of when it was written.

The Christian faith on the basis of these claims could never have gotten off the ground. They couldn't have said the tomb is empty unless the tomb wasn't empty because of when they were saying it. They couldn't have said, people saw Jesus raised from the dead unless they had seen Him raised from the dead because those people were still there. They couldn't have talked about the miracles. They couldn't have said, this Jesus claimed to be the Son of God unless He had claimed to be the Son of God.

I'm sorry, you can't say. He's a legend. You can't say. Well, somebody says, if I keep reading newspaper accounts, if it says scholars say we have no idea what Jesus Christ is actually, what Jesus Christ really taught and what He said. Yeah, I know.

By the way, they very often put themselves forward as mainstream historians and they're not. They're very, very skeptical and let me just put it this way. If you doubt on the basis of historical evidence that Jesus Christ didn't said all these things, you have to doubt and you have to say we can't know anything from the past. You have far more, far more evidence that Jesus Christ didn't said these things than you have evidence that Caesar invaded Gaul. Far more.

We only have one account of that. We have four accounts of this. The only account we have is a manuscript, the earliest copy, 900 years after the event. The gospels we have, we have manuscripts from just within a few years after they were written, but here's the difference. There's a bias.

When you study Caesar's Gallic Wars, you don't sit down and say, I wonder if this is true because if it is, it'll change the way in which I have to live. It doesn't matter whether Caesar's Gallic Wars are true or not. Not the way you have to live, but who in the world can come to the gospel and see the account and be objective. Don't you know what is wrong with saying, ah, yes, as a scholar, I can read the New Testament objectively. You can't.

Nobody can. Nobody can. Because if it's true, unlike Caesar's Gallic Wars, you will have to change the way you live tomorrow. You have lost control of your life if it's true. You've got to do what he says.

You've got to live your life for him. You can't live the way you feel is right or wrong. You have to find out what he says. You have to follow him. Who in the world could possibly be objective studying that?

Imagine a judge and she's about to hear a case about a particular company and the prosecution is trying to say this company is guilty of fraud. What if that judge was a major investor in that company? What if that judge, if the company was found to be fraudulent, would lose thousands of dollars? Common sense and the laws of this land would say she has a vested interest, she's conflict of interest, she cannot hear the case. But when you read the Bible and you sit down and say one of these things are true or not, you have even more conflict of interest than she does.

If this is found to be true, you stand to lose control of your whole life. And if you know that you've got that conflict of interest but you have to study it anyway and you have to make a decision, there's no other way around it. You better make sure that you double and triple check every one of your doubts because they could be prejudice. You have to double and triple check every one of your bits of skepticism because you know you have a tremendous motive to not believe it. And that's the reason why I would tell you, so many scholars will be skeptical of the historical account of Jesus and won't be skeptical of what Caesars got like wars, Herodotus, all those accounts, waitonious and so on.

He's not a legend. Now if he's not a legend and the second impossible option is he couldn't be a good man, he couldn't be. Do you know what he says? Have you read what he says? People like to say, oh, but he was just a fine teacher.

How could he be a fine teacher? He says, I'm the way the truth in the life. No one comes to the Father but by me. He says, if you want to follow me, if you want to be my disciple you have to hate your Father and Mother. He says, anyone who wants to lose his life, save his life will lose it, but anyone who will lose his life for my sake will find it.

He says, all power is given unto me and low I'm with you always the end of the earth. You know what he's saying? Let me just give it to you in modern language. He says, I'm the only way to ultimate reality. I am the ultimate reality.

He says, if you want to follow me, you have got to give me everything. Your love for me must be so high that your love for anything else, even parents and children and spouses has to look like hate in comparison. If there's anything keeping you from me, if it's an eye, throw it away, pluck it out. If it's a hand, cut it off. Get rid of it.

It's not worth losing me. All reality, all the universe will bow to me. All things will bow to me and all things will bow to you if you come to me. Who has ever said things like this before? I'll tell you one thing, no good person would say this.

This person is either God or he's on the level of a poached egg, a man who says he's a poached egg. He's either God or he's a terrible liar, but he can't be a good man. Reject him, hate him, assassinate him. But none of this nonsense that he's a good man. He's not a legend, he's not a good man.

Then we say, ah, well, maybe he was a liar or maybe he was a lunatic. But there's a couple of problems with both of those and I'll just treat them together to get to the end. Mainly because both the liar option and the lunatic option are both the same option. In other words, you're saying he fooled his followers. He was either a very bad person like the Pharisee said in John 9, or he was really a lunatic.

We've got a bit of a problem there. Here's why. For example, look at the quality of his teaching. It's not the ravings of a madman. GK Chester didn't put it this way.

If I found a key on the road and discovered it fit and opened a particular lock. If I found a key on the road and discovered it fit and opened a particular lock at my house,  I'd assume most likely that the key was made by the lock maker. And if I find a set of teachings set out in pre-modern Oriental society that has proven itself of such universal validity,  that it has fascinated and satisfied millions of people in every century, including the best minds in history and the simplest hearts. That it has made itself at home in virtually every culture, inspired masterpieces of beauty in every field of art,  continues to go rapidly and spread and assert itself in lands where a century ago the name of Jesus Christ was not even heard. If such teaching so obviously fits the locks of so many human souls in so many times and so many places,  are they likely to be the work of a deceiver or a fool?

In fact, it is more likely that they were designed by the heart maker. Well, then take a look at his life. Look at his life. We see the account. Is that life a life of a liar or a lunatic?

Someone's put it this way. No one has ever yet discovered the word Jesus ought to have said. The account. You try to come up with a better line. Do you realize what kind of person you have to be to even make this up?

If somebody made this up, we would have to be sitting here having the same kind of discussion over who is this incredible person who made it up? What kind of person would this be? No one has ever yet discovered the word Jesus ought to have said or the deed he ought to have done. Nothing he does falls short. In fact, he is always surprising you and taking your breath away because he's better than you could imagine.

Why? They are the surprises of perfection. He combined virtues never seen together, tenderness without weakness, strength without harshness, humility without the slightest lack of confidence,  holiness and unbending convictions without the slightest lack of approachability, power without insensitivity, passion without prejudice,  the harshest judgment on the self-satisfied, yet the most winsome kindness to the broken and the marginal, never inconsistent, never a false step, never a drawing note. P.T. Forsyth said,  If God be not thus, he is less than the God we crave and less than the God the world needs.

This is the holy love that deserves to be almighty. Listen, when we describe it, we're done. When we describe it, even describing it, can't you begin to feel a little bit of what they saw? The reason they got down and worshipped him? You can see it when you read the gospels.

You can see it as we just described it. They felt they knew that they were looking through the substance of a human flesh, the very being of God. The last people in the world who would believe this were 1st century Jews. What power could have gotten them to believe it? What's the alternative?

St. Thomas Aquinas put it this way. He says the only alternative is to believe even greater miracle. And that greater miracle would be, if Jesus Christ did not happen and even more unbelievable miracle happened,  the conversion of one half of the Roman world and their moral transformation into unsolficionist and new heights of holiness all by the biggest lie in history. What's the inescapable option?

Not a legend, can't be a good man, those are the impossible ones. The improbable ones, a deceiver or delusional. Where does it bring us? It brings us to this place. If you get rid of your bias against this possible supernatural,  if you get rid of your bias against the idea of a miracle,  if you get rid of that bias, it's hard to believe who he said he is, but it's harder not to.

It's difficult to believe who he said he is, but the theories that you have to adhere to in order to get out from it are even more species and have even more holes. And as a result, we come to the final and we say he must be who he said he is. If that's true, it means number one. It means that there is no way that you have really met the real Jesus unless your reaction to him has been extreme. If there's anybody in this room who doesn't hate him or on the other hand, fear him.

I think he's the most dangerous person that ever lived or on the other hand, there's three hands on this man here. Or on the other hand, love him, adore him and he's thrown over everything to follow him. Those are the only three alternative responses that are rational. Don't you see? Because of his claims.

You should either hate him and attack him or you should fear him and run from him or you should love him and bow down before him. But if you have said, well, I don't know what I think or I think I'm a Christian. I wish I was a better Christian. I don't know if I'm a Christian. You don't know who he is.

You have never seen the real Jesus. You're responding to a figment of your imagination. Get real. Lastly, if Jesus is who he said he is, it's great news. You know why?

Because he's saying morality and goodness is not the way. See, Buddha says, I am not God. Look to my teaching. If you just live a good life, that'll be enough. But if on the other hand, if on the other hand, if on the other hand, you see Jesus who says, don't look to my teaching.

Look to me. Buddha says, I'm not God. I show you the way to God. Jesus says, I'm God come to you. You will never be good enough.

You will never be moral enough to reach God. I have come to live the life you should have lived. I've come to die the death. You should have died to pay for your sins. I've come all the way.

Believe in me. See, Buddha says, this is the way. Jesus says, I am the way. Buddha says, I can show you the way to God. Jesus says, get real.

You'll never get there. You'll never be good enough. I'm God come to you. That's good news. If you understand what I just said, and you're not a Christian tonight, you better ask yourself, since I have lots and lots and lots of conflict of interest, I have lots and lots and lots of fears that make me prejudice against the truth of it, please agree tonight to explore.

Some of you think everything I said is silly. I hope you come back some other time anyway. I hope you'll think about it. Some of you are surprised. Some of you say, I need to study more.

Some of you are saying, I need to get more into this. My stereotypes have been shattered a little bit. I've gotten new ideas to think about. I'm convicted in some ways. I would like you, if you can, after the service is done, to stick around for a question and answer time, and or go to the welcome table afterwards, out front, get a little blue piece of paper that will give you a book called, Who Is This Jesus?

This is for people who want to know. People who aren't sure who he is. People who are guests tonight, go out, fill out one of those forms, take it downstairs these lounge, and you'll get a free book of the same title of the talk tonight. What we're going to do now, I'm going to pray, we're going to hear a piece of music, and right after that I'm going to take just two or three questions from people to get our question and answer time started. Then I'll dismiss all of you and the people who need to stay can stay up front here and we'll have a question and answer time right afterwards.

Let me pray with you. Our Father, we close this time with prayer because we know that like Jesus said to the Pharisees, because you don't think you're blind, you're very blind. And because you haven't admitted that you don't see, you don't see. But if you admit you don't see, you begin to see. And if you admit your prejudice, you're losing your prejudices, I pray that your spirit will help people to see that they don't see, so that they can begin to see.

And you will get people here, a Holy Spirit, to help people to see their prejudices so they can drop their prejudices so that we can see whether or not Jesus Christ is existentially satisfying and intellectually credible. I ask that your spirit would help everybody here to see that in Jesus name we pray. Amen.

今天。我记得当我在大学的时候，有一个画面我永远不会忘记。那是在1970年，在柬埔寨入侵期间，我真的不太了解这段历史，但我知道在美国东北部的很多大学校园都关闭了，学生们基本上抵制上课，因为他们想谈论生活的问题，谈论我们要往哪里去。结果，至少在我所在的校园里，每天在大学广场上都有开放麦克风。任何人都可以上去发言，成群的人会出现。

无论你走到哪里，你都会看到一群群的人聚在一起谈论生命的意义。有一群学生竖起了一个标语牌。我记得那个标语牌是黑底白字。上面写着：耶稣基督的复活在理智上是可信的，在存在意义上是令人满足的。多年来我逐渐明白，这是检验任何有效世界观、任何有效哲学、任何有效宗教的两个标准。

它必须既是理性的、连贯的，它必须是真实的，同时它也必须是相关的，它必须满足我的需要，它必须与我的经验相连。现在现代人在涉及宗教或哲学时，往往不再问第一个问题了。我的意思是那真的是1970年的事了。现在我们只问，哦宗教，谁知道它是不是真的，它对我有用吗？谁知道它在理智上是否可信，我的意思是毕竟，每个人都有自己的观点。

我想知道的是它对我来说在存在意义上是否令人满足。恕我直言，我认为这是一种危险的方法。因为我们确实知道一种叫做安慰剂效应的东西，你知道。安慰剂效应是这样的。如果我生病了，我服用了一些我真的相信会让我好转的药。

但我有非常严重的症状，我正在死于某种疾病。如果我足够相信它，就会有安慰剂效应。我的一些症状会消失。我会感觉好一些。但从长远来看，安慰剂效应是非常致命的。

因为客观上，它对我的疾病无能为力。它可能会让我误以为，我很好，我没事，我不需要做其他任何事情。如果存在一个客观的属灵宇宙。我现在不是说存在，我不是要向你证明这一点。我只是说如果存在一个客观的属灵宇宙，就像物理宇宙一样客观。

那么进入一种宗教或信仰或世界观或哲学——每个人都有一套运作的哲学。每个人都有一套关于我们出了什么问题、我们要往哪里去、人性是什么以及终极实在是什么的答案。每个人都有一套运作的哲学。如果你的方法是说只要我相信它，它感觉很好，它对我有用就行了。如果存在属灵的安慰剂效应呢？

如果它让你感觉还好呢？你知道，每一个宗教，每一种哲学，即使是最疯狂、最荒诞、最不连贯的，都能产生一些人说，我现在因为坚持这个美妙的组织而拥有了生命的喜悦和意义。每个人，任何人都能做到这一点。黑手党也能做到这一点。有收入是件好事。

有兄弟是件好事，某种意义上的兄弟。如果存在安慰剂效应呢？如果你暂时感觉良好，但客观上，你正在死于某种疾病，而这个信仰与此无关，它无法处理这个问题。你难道看不出这会有多具破坏性吗？基督教的特点是一种意愿，几乎是一种挑战，向人们说，是的，我们在存在意义上令人满足。

世界上有数百万人可以说基督教帮助了我。没有人否认这一点。这是事实。但基督教挑战并说，但这不仅仅是在存在意义上令人满足。我们在理智上是可信的。

我们是相关的，因为我们是真实的。这不是现代思维方式所持的态度。现代思维方式是，如果它有用，它就是真的。基督教说，哦，你难道看不出吗？那会是安慰剂效应。

我们只有在真实的情况下才能最终起作用。不要因为基督教相关就来信基督教，尽管它确实相关。不要因为基督教令人兴奋就来信基督教，尽管它绝对令人兴奋。不要因为基督教会满足你的需要就来信基督教，尽管它确实会满足你的需要。来信是因为它是真实的。

正因为它是真实的，它才会满足你的需要。它在这个角色中令人兴奋。如果它不是真实的，它就是安慰剂。现在，你怎么知道基督教是真实的？这是一个相当大的挑战。

这是一个相当大的挑战，尤其是在今晚这样一段有限的时间内完成。因此，我想做的是给你一个主要证据的概述，我认为这是支持基督教信息真实性的压倒性且不可回避的证据。那就是耶稣基督作为事实数据。耶稣基督作为事实。他是谁？

你看你刚刚听到描述的约翰福音第9章。耶稣的行为总是让人们提出理论。你听到那些理论了吗？这人是个罪人。等等，另一个人说。

你知道，我从未见过罪人做这种事情。这人是先知，但这够了吗？最后，耶稣基督说，我就是医治你的那位，盲人跪下敬拜耶稣。敬拜。你听到了吗？

敬拜。耶稣做了什么？他接受了。他站着不动。这家伙是谁？

什么样的人会接受敬拜？休斯顿·史密斯写了一本很棒的书，叫做《世界伟大宗教》。这是一本老书。已经出版很长时间了。你知道，是宗教课程的必读书，一本很棒的书。

《世界伟大宗教》。在那本书中他说，在世界历史上只有两位杰出且有影响力的人物，他们的生命是如此不可思议，如此巨大。他们生命的数据是如此无法解释，以至于他们周围的人不仅仅是问，他们是谁？你是谁？而是问，你是什么？

休斯顿·史密斯说只有两个人在世界历史上真正产生了影响，他们的生命标志着如此的美丽，以至于人们不仅仅说，你是谁？他们问，你是什么？这两个人是佛陀和耶稣。史密斯指出，这两个人的回应是完全相反的，完全对立的。在两种情况下，人们都想敬拜他们，因为他们从未见过慈悲。

他们从未见过正直。他们从未见过这样的生命。他们从未见过美丽。他们从未见过智慧。他们从未见过任何像这样的东西。

史密斯说，人们问，你是什么？他们想要敬拜。佛陀说，绝对不要，不要敬拜我。我不是神。佛陀总是不断地说，不要看我。

看我的法，我的教义，我的教导。不要看我。看我的法，我的教义。耶稣，毫不含糊地接受敬拜。耶稣，不仅毫不含糊地没有说，我不是神，他毫不含糊地说，甚至不是我是一位神，他说，我就是那位神。

每当有人敬拜时，当多马跪下说，我的主，我的神，当盲人敬拜时，耶稣站在那里平静地接受了。关于耶稣如此无法解释的一件事是这样的。有很多人，至少有20个人，我们可以说是世界历史上最有影响力的人物。事实上，耶稣也可能在任何一组世界上最有影响力的10个人物中。事实上，你可能会把耶稣放在前三名。

事实上，甚至可能达成共识说他是最有影响力的单一人物，但他在那个群体中。他在那个团体中。另一方面，也有许多人声称自己是神。他们声称自己是神。他们声称自己是神圣的人物，但他们之间除了一个人之外没有重叠。

因为那些声称神性的人总是无法说服除了一小群边缘化的、你知道的、失衡的、乌合之众的被剥夺权利的人之外的任何人，相信他们是神。哦，这样的人有几十个。我是神，敬拜我。这样的人有几十个。他们从未说服过除了一小群失衡的人之外的任何人。

另一方面，在这边，你有一大群人，他们是世界历史上最有影响力的人，在几乎所有情况下，当他们谈论自己时，都有一种谦卑。不要看我，佛陀说。看我的法。他们总是说，不要敬拜我。不要那样做。

这就是使他们伟大的原因。这就是使他们有影响力的原因。除了一个人。有一个人同时属于两个类别。一个人不仅提出了令人难以置信的声明，而且还让人们相信。

如果世界历史上最有影响力的人物之一声称自己是神，因此声称地球上每个人都应该绝对效忠他。没有一个有思想的人。没有一个有思想的人可以在不研究它的情况下走开。你不能说我有平衡和深思熟虑的人生态度。我不是基督徒。

我不相信关于耶稣是神的所有那些东西。但是你看，我没有研究过很多。我是在其中长大的，但我基本上，你知道，我上过宗教101。我上过哲学101。我基本上意识到我周围大多数聪明的人和大多数酷的人也不相信这个。

所以我也不相信。朋友们，耶稣声称的重要性和他影响的重要性表明，你最好不要只是怀疑他不是神。神啊，你最好知道他不是神。这个声称的重要性。看，如果你从纽约市一家主要律师事务所收到非常正式的信笺纸上的一封信，说请来见我们。

你是英国王位的失散已久的继承人。你的第一反应是什么？拜托。我是中国人。拜托。

不可能。然而，你知道，你甚至不会打个电话。我再给你举一个例子。假设你从国税局收到正式信笺，上面说你欠我们40万美元的欠税，你说，不可能。我甚至没赚过4万美元。

怎么可能？然而，你看到了声称的重要性。声称的重要性意味着你最好不要只是怀疑它是真的。你最好知道它不是真的，因为如果有可能它是真的而你错过了，你的生命就毁了。当耶稣基督说，我就是道路、真理和生命。

除了通过我，没有人能到达终极实在。你最好知道那不是真的。他是个疯子。你看，我的意思是，我不认为每个人都必须研究大卫·科雷什的生平，因为如果他真的是他所说的那样怎么办。有很多其他像他一样的人，我不认为我们有那么多证据，你知道，来支持他的声称。

但这里有一个，一个，一个提出这类声称的人，看看他生命的影响。数据，耶稣基督的数据。你看过吗？现在，让我向你展示数据是什么。然后让我展示只有五种可能。

我只是要快速浏览一遍，因为这基本上就是论证。也许你从未见过一个整体的论证。支持基督教的论证。支持耶稣是他所说的那位的论证。看数据，只有五种可能的答案，五种解释。

他是谁？我刚刚向你展示了，没有一个智慧的人可以不去看数据并决定你相信这五个选项中的哪一个。因为如果你甚至不尝试，如果你只是忽视它，如果你说，嗯，我不知道，我没有看过它。你怎么了？

如果你错了，你的生命可能会毁掉。这个声称的重要性。看数据，只有五种方式来解释它。这是数据。第一，大约2000年前在巴勒斯坦有一个人，他声称自己是神，他声称自己是弥赛亚，从天上来的神的儿子，他声称要把天国带到地上。

第一，第二，当他带着这个信息到处走时，听到他说话的人看到他做了看起来像奇迹的事情。他们看到他显然用一小块面包或两块喂饱了5000人。他们看到他在水面上行走。他们看到他使死人复活。他们看到他医治病人。

这是第二点。我不是告诉你他确实行了奇迹。我是告诉你数百人看到他显然行了奇迹。这引起了令人难以置信的轰动。你刚刚听到描绘的约翰福音第9章就是一个例子。

第三，他不仅声称自己是神，而且他说服了最接近他的人，与他生活在一起的人，使徒们等等，相信他是神。要记住，地球上最不可能相信一个人可以是神的人就是第一世纪的犹太人。因为在东方，他们对神的理解是神是一种存在于每个人和每件事物中的生命力，所以说一个人是神的某种显现并不是那么不寻常。在西方，罗马人和希腊人对神有这样的理解，有很多神，他们过去常常伪装，他们过去常常以人的形象出现，暂时寻欢作乐。我的意思是你可以在神话中看到这一点，但犹太人，犹太人对神的超越性有着当时世界上任何其他地方都无与伦比的理解。

犹太人对神的理解不仅是内在的，而且是超越的，一位超越世界的神，创造了世界，无始的神。犹太人在十诫的前两条诫命中被教导了2000年，永远，永远，永远不要敬拜任何被造物，永远不要，永远不要敬拜牛犊，永远不要敬拜日月，永远不要。多年来他们被灌输这一点，他们甚至不使用神的名字。那太神圣了，世界上最不可能相信某人是神的人就是一群第一世纪的犹太人，但不仅如此，世界上最不可能相信你是神的人是与你一起睡觉的人。嘿，有各种各样的伟大英雄，对吧，每个人都喜欢他们，然后出现了与他们一起生活的人，有人给他们一份书约，有人写了一篇文章。

这就是为什么在这一栏中有数百人相信自己是神，说自己是神，但从未产生过任何影响的原因。为什么？因为基本上总有人看到残忍，有人看到自私。有人看到欺骗，有人看到虚伪，你能让相信这个人是神的最后一群人，就是与你一起生活、与你一起睡觉、与你一起工作的人。事实第三，围绕耶稣基督的那群人，不仅听到了他声称自己是神的话，他们还相信了。

第四，他死后，数十名和数百人承认并证实他们看到他复活了。不仅所有的使徒，而且我们知道至少有500人同时，保罗在哥林多前书中告诉我们这一点，我们稍后会讲到这个。同时，看到他复活了。这是事实第四，数十名，数十名人。有时数百人同时说，我见过他，他没有死，他复活了。

事实第五，那次经历改变了这些男男女女的生命，以至于他们走向世界，他们为传播这个消息而死。他们中的许多人做出了巨大的牺牲。他们中的许多人遭受了殉道者的死亡，但他们被完全改变了，以至于他们到处去，在整个地中海地区传播信仰，五件事。有一个人声称自己是神，他显然行了奇迹，他让接近他的人相信他是神。在他死后,许多人看到他复活了,那些人被与复活救主相遇的经历如此改变,以至于他们到处传播这个消息。

你如何解释这些事实？你如何解释？你如何解释数据，他是谁？你必须想出点什么，只有五种可能性，我只是快速浏览一遍。我会告诉你，前两个是不可能的。

前两个选项是不可能的。我甚至不会说不可能，因为我会称它们为选项。有五个选项，前两个是不可能的，接下来两个是不太可能的，最后一个是不可避免的。它们都以I开头。前两个，前两个，第一个。

纽约的大多数人用这种方式摆脱数据的困扰，所以我至少要在这上面花几分钟。大多数人说他是一个传说。我们不知道这些事情是否发生过。这是纽约人摆脱困扰的常见方式。我的意思是这样的。

换句话说，我像我说的那样来找你，我希望今晚这里的许多人之后我们可以交谈，在节目结束后有一个问答时间等等。你可能会在这一点上反驳我，但我会说大多数人，我会说你如何解释那些数据，你说我们怎么知道耶稣是谁？我们怎么知道他声称自己是神？我们怎么知道他行了明显的奇迹？我们怎么知道所有这些事情？

你难道不知道耶稣基督像任何有魅力的人一样吗？他的追随者对他感到惊奇，所以在他死后，他们开始编织关于他的故事和传说。你知道你玩过传话游戏，你对一个人说，然后下一个人，经过多年，这些故事被夸大了。早期教会开始把这些故事编入其中，他们开始编造故事，他们开始把话放进耶稣的嘴里以满足他们的需要。所以最后它们在许多年后被写在新约中，但它们是由基督徒写的，他们不是公正的人。

他们在多年后写下这些东西，所以我们不知道耶稣真正说了什么。我们不知道这些事情中哪些是真实的，我们不知道这些记述中哪些是真实的，你不能把新约当作历史来读。他是一个传说，这就是我如何摆脱数据困扰的。让我只给你三个实际上不可能的理由。这本身就是一个很好的话题，但我只能给你三个理由说明为什么不可能。

第一，圣经不是作为传说写的，圣经是作为历史写的。很多人喜欢说，嗯，你知道，我的意思是看看围绕佛陀的传说，看看佛教著作，看看《古兰经》，看看这些著作，但这里有一个区别。例如，当你去看新约，你去看路加福音。在路加福音的开头，路加说了这样的话。他说许多其他人已经根据目击者传给我们的内容编写了关于耶稣生平的记述。

所以我从一开始就对一切都进行了仔细调查，我写了一个有序的记述，这样你就可以确信这些事情。他怎么说的？他在说，看，我不是目击者，但我认识许多目击者。所以我仔细地去采访了目击者。这是一个像调查记者一样写作的人。

他说我去采访了目击者。我比较了各种记述。我把它们编织成一个有序的记述，这样你就可以确信这些事情发生了。另一位批评家，一位文学批评家这样说。他说当你读新约时，你马上就能看出福音书不是作为传说写的。

从某种意义上说，他说它们不够好。而且，听着，他试图说它们不够好。这是他的意思。他说如果它们不是历史，那么它们必须是现实主义散文小说，这种小说实际上在18世纪之前从未存在过。像约翰福音第8章中的小插曲，当他们把行淫时被抓的妇人带到耶稣面前时，耶稣在尘土中写字。

那些在故事中根本没有特殊意义的小细节是标志。看到他在说什么了吗？他说今天我们有像小说那样的虚构作品。那是现实主义散文小说。它进入细节。

它说她来到门前。她转动门把手。你知道，它慢慢展开。那是我们现在写虚构作品的方式。这个人说，如果福音书有所有这些细节，有像当耶稣接待被称为行淫妇人时他在沙地上写字这样的小陈述。

没有告诉我们他在写什么。这与情节无关。与故事无关。传说不会放入那种小细节。这位批评家说他们不是那样写虚构作品的。

路加说这不是传说。路加不是把它当作传说来写的。因此，当你读新约福音书时，你必须假设它们要么是绝对故意的有意骗局。它们是谎言，要么是历史记载。没有中间地带。

你准备好这样说了吗？现在，这是第一步。摆脱耶稣是传说这个想法，因为第二步是这样的。它们要么是历史，要么是谎言。如果是谎言，试试这两件事。

直到大约1900年，许多学者说，啊，你知道福音书，它们直到事件发生后100年才被写下来。过去80年的研究和考古学已经把它往前推，往前推，往前推。所以现在所有学者都会说福音书是在公元70年左右写的。你知道，保罗的书信是在事件发生后20年内写的。这意味着什么。

它意味着非常重要的事情。如果你要捏造。如果你要创造故事并说这发生在这座山上，这发生在这一年，这发生在那一年，你能让它成功的唯一方法是等到所有目击者都死了。1970年，在我的大学校园里，当我们关闭校园以便我们可以辩论柬埔寨入侵及其道德性时，没有人拿着摄像机到处走。我不认为我们有摄像机。

我们确实有电影，但我们没有摄像机。没有人坐下来做记录。所以真的没有历史记载。但如果我现在决定，23年后，这与保罗在写他的书信时距离耶稣生平事件的时间一样长，如果我决定写在罢课期间我的大学校园发生了骚乱，有七八个人被杀，那永远不会成功。有太多人还活着，他们中的一些人已经死了，但大多数人还活着。

他们会说，你在说什么？我在《纽约时报书评》上读到了这本书的评论，算了吧。不可能。他们会非常愤怒，他们会出来。如果你想捏造某事，你必须等到所有目击者都死了，这样就没有证实或矛盾的可能性。

我们所知道的几乎所有新约文件都是在目击者的有生之年写的。它们怎么可能是绝对的、完全有意的谎言？保罗在《帖撒罗尼迦前书》15章说，500人同时看到耶稣基督从死里复活。他们看到他活着。他在事件发生后20到25年写的，每个人都同意这一点，所有学者都同意，在事件发生后。

这是一封公开信。这是公共知识。当有数百人在那里本可以说的时候，一个信仰怎么可能基于这类记述，你说坟墓不是空的是什么意思？看，那里就是坟墓。你说那些事情从未发生过是什么意思？

这500人在哪里？我一个都不认识。你看，它能是传说吗，它要么是谎言，要么是历史文件。它是谎言有意义吗？不，你知道，不是因为它写得太早，而是最后，人们会为骗局而死吗？

想想门徒们。他们所有人都必须参与巨大的阴谋。他们会为骗局而死吗？肯尼思·斯科特·拉托雷特，他是一位了不起的历史学家，他在耶鲁大学生活和工作，他曾经这样说。他说，为什么在希腊罗马世界竞争的所有教派和哲学中，基督教成功了并超越了所有其他的？

为什么它成功了，尽管遭受了比任何其他宗教更严重的反对？为什么它成功了，尽管它在高位没有有影响力的支持者，而主要由穷人和奴隶组成？它如何成功到如此彻底，以至于它迫使历史上最强大的国家与之妥协，然后比试图根除它的那个帝国活得更久？很明显，他总结道，在基督教的最开始，一定发生了一次巨大的能量释放，也许在我们的历史上是无与伦比的，没有它，基督教未来的发展是无法解释的。所有这些人都有可能为谎言而死，也许可能，绝对可能，但把这与它被写下来的时间放在一起。

基于这些声称的基督教信仰永远不可能起步。他们不可能说坟墓是空的，除非坟墓不是空的，因为他们说这话的时候。他们不可能说，人们看到耶稣从死里复活，除非他们真的看到他从死里复活，因为那些人还在那里。他们不可能谈论奇迹。他们不可能说，这位耶稣声称自己是神的儿子，除非他确实声称自己是神的儿子。

对不起，你不能说。他是传说。你不能说。嗯，有人说，如果我一直读报纸报道，如果它说学者们说我们不知道耶稣基督实际上是什么，耶稣基督真正教导和说了什么。是的，我知道。

顺便说一下，他们经常把自己说成是主流历史学家，但他们不是。他们非常、非常怀疑，让我这样说。如果你基于历史证据怀疑耶稣基督没有说所有这些话，你就必须怀疑，你就必须说我们无法从过去知道任何事情。你有更多，更多的证据表明耶稣基督确实说了这些话，而不是凯撒入侵高卢的证据。多得多。

我们只有一个关于那件事的记述。我们有四个关于这个的记述。我们拥有的唯一记述是一份手稿，最早的副本是在事件发生后900年。我们拥有的福音书，我们有在它们被写下来后仅几年内的手稿，但这里有区别。有偏见。

当你研究《凯撒高卢战记》时，你不会坐下来说，我想知道这是不是真的，因为如果是真的，它会改变我必须生活的方式。《凯撒高卢战记》是否真实无关紧要。不是你必须生活的方式，但谁能来到福音书面前看到记述并保持客观。你难道不知道说，啊，是的，作为一个学者，我可以客观地阅读新约是错误的吗。你不能。

没有人能。没有人能。因为如果它是真的，不像《凯撒高卢战记》，你将不得不改变你明天的生活方式。如果它是真的，你就失去了对生命的控制。你必须做他说的。

你必须为他而活。你不能按照你觉得对或错的方式生活。你必须找出他说什么。你必须跟随他。谁能在研究这个时可能保持客观？

想象一位法官，她即将审理一起关于某家公司的案件，起诉方试图说这家公司犯有欺诈罪。如果那位法官是那家公司的主要投资者呢？如果那位法官，如果公司被发现有欺诈行为，会损失数千美元呢？常识和这片土地的法律会说她有既得利益，她有利益冲突，她不能审理这个案子。但当你读圣经，当你坐下来说这些事情是真的还是假的，你有比她更大的利益冲突。

如果这被发现是真的，你将失去对整个生命的控制。如果你知道你有那种利益冲突，但你无论如何都必须研究它，你必须做出决定，没有其他办法。你最好确保你对每一个怀疑都进行双重和三重检查，因为它们可能是偏见。你必须对每一个怀疑主义的想法进行双重和三重检查，因为你知道你有巨大的动机不相信它。这就是为什么我要告诉你，这么多学者会对耶稣的历史记述持怀疑态度，而不会对《凯撒高卢战记》、希罗多德、所有那些记述、韦顿尼乌斯等等持怀疑态度。

他不是传说。现在，如果他不是传说，第二个不可能的选项是他不可能是一个好人，他不可能是。你知道他说了什么吗？你读过他说的话吗？人们喜欢说，哦，但他只是一位优秀的教师。他怎么可能是一位优秀的教师？

他说，我就是道路、真理和生命。除了通过我，没有人能到父那里去。他说，如果你想跟随我，如果你想成为我的门徒，你必须恨你的父母。他说，任何想要保全生命的人会失去它，但任何为我的缘故失去生命的人会得到它。

他说，一切权柄都赐给我了，看哪，我永远与你们同在，直到地极。你知道他在说什么吗？让我用现代语言给你说。他说，我是通向终极实在的唯一道路。我就是终极实在。

他说，如果你想跟随我，你必须把一切都给我。你对我的爱必须如此之高，以至于你对任何其他东西的爱，甚至是父母、孩子和配偶，在比较之下都必须看起来像恨。如果有任何东西阻止你来到我这里，如果是一只眼睛，扔掉它，挖出来。如果是一只手，砍掉它。摆脱它。

失去我是不值得的。所有的实在，所有的宇宙都将向我屈膝。万物都将向我屈膝，如果你来到我这里，万物也将向你屈膝。以前有谁说过这样的话？我告诉你一件事，没有一个好人会说这个。

这个人要么是神，要么他就像一个煮熟的鸡蛋，一个说自己是煮熟鸡蛋的人。他要么是神，要么是一个可怕的骗子，但他不可能是一个好人。拒绝他，恨他，暗杀他。但不要说他是一个好人这种胡说八道。他不是传说，他不是好人。

那么我们说，啊，好吧，也许他是个骗子或者也许他是个疯子。但这两者都有几个问题，我只是把它们一起处理以结束。主要是因为骗子选项和疯子选项都是同一个选项。换句话说，你是说他欺骗了他的追随者。他要么是一个非常坏的人，就像法利赛人在约翰福音第9章中说的那样，要么他真的是个疯子。

我们有点问题。原因如下。例如，看看他教导的质量。这不是一个疯子的胡言乱语。切斯特顿没有这样说。

如果我在路上找到一把钥匙并发现它适合并打开一把特定的锁。如果我在路上找到一把钥匙并发现它适合并打开我家的一把特定的锁，我会假设这把钥匙很可能是锁匠制造的。如果我发现一套在前现代东方社会提出的教导被证明具有如此普遍的有效性，以至于它在每个世纪都吸引并满足了数百万人，包括历史上最优秀的头脑和最单纯的心灵。它在几乎每一种文化中都安家落户，在艺术的每一个领域都激发了美的杰作，继续迅速传播并在一个世纪前甚至没有听说过耶稣基督名字的土地上主张自己。如果这样的教导如此明显地适合这么多时代、这么多地方的这么多人类灵魂的锁，它们有可能是欺骗者或傻瓜的作品吗？

事实上，更有可能的是它们是由造心者设计的。那么，看看他的生命。看看他的生命。我们看到记述。那生命是骗子或疯子的生命吗？

有人这样说。还没有人发现耶稣本应该说的话。那个记述。你试着想出更好的台词。你意识到你必须是什么样的人才能编造这个吗？

如果有人编造了这个，我们就必须坐在这里对编造这个的这个令人难以置信的人进行同样的讨论？这会是什么样的人？还没有人发现耶稣本应该说的话或本应该做的事。他所做的没有一件事达不到标准。事实上，他总是让你惊讶，让你屏息，因为他比你想象的更好。

为什么？它们是完美的惊喜。他结合了从未一起出现过的美德，温柔而不软弱，力量而不苛刻，谦卑而丝毫不缺乏自信，圣洁和坚定的信念而丝毫不缺乏亲和力，力量而不迟钝，热情而不偏见，对自满者最严厉的审判，但对破碎和边缘化的人最有吸引力的仁慈，从不前后矛盾，从不迈出错误的一步，从不有一个虚假的音符。P.T.福赛斯说，如果神不是这样，他就不如我们渴望的神，不如世界需要的神。

这是应该全能的圣爱。听着,当我们描述它时,我们就完成了。当我们描述它时,即使描述它,你难道不能开始感受到一点他们所看到的吗？他们跪下敬拜他的原因？你读福音书时可以看到。

你在我们刚才描述它时可以看到。他们感到他们知道他们正在透过人类肉体的实质,看到神的本体。世界上最不可能相信这一点的人是第一世纪的犹太人。什么力量能让他们相信呢？另一种选择是什么？

圣托马斯·阿奎那这样说。他说唯一的替代方案是相信一个更大的奇迹。那个更大的奇迹将是,如果耶稣基督没有发生,一个更难以置信的奇迹发生了,罗马世界一半的人改变信仰,他们的道德转变为非自我中心和达到新的圣洁高度,这一切都是由历史上最大的谎言完成的。什么是不可避免的选项？

不是传说,不可能是好人,这些是不可能的。不太可能的,是欺骗者或妄想者。它把我们带到哪里？它把我们带到这个地方。如果你摆脱你对这种可能的超自然的偏见,如果你摆脱你对奇迹的想法的偏见,如果你摆脱那种偏见,相信他所说的他是谁是困难的,但更难不相信。

相信他所说的他是谁是困难的,但为了摆脱它你必须坚持的理论有更多漏洞,更加牵强附会。因此,我们得出最终结论并说他必定是他所说的那位。如果这是真的,这意味着第一点。这意味着没有办法你真正遇见了真实的耶稣,除非你对他的反应是极端的。如果这个房间里有任何人既不恨他,或者另一方面,怕他。

我认为他是有史以来最危险的人,或者另一方面,这个人有三只手。或者另一方面,爱他,崇拜他,他已经抛弃了一切来跟随他。这些是唯一三种理性的替代反应。你难道看不出吗？因为他的声称。

你应该要么恨他并攻击他,要么应该怕他并逃离他,要么应该爱他并在他面前屈膝。但如果你说过,嗯,我不知道我怎么想,或者我想我是基督徒。我希望我是一个更好的基督徒。我不知道我是不是基督徒。你不知道他是谁。

你从未见过真正的耶稣。你正在回应你想象中的虚构形象。现实一点。最后,如果耶稣是他所说的那位,这是好消息。你知道为什么吗？

因为他说道德和善良不是道路。你看,佛陀说,我不是神。看我的教导。如果你只是过一个好的生活,那就足够了。但如果另一方面,如果另一方面,如果另一方面,你看到耶稣说,不要看我的教导。

看我。佛陀说,我不是神。我向你展示通向神的道路。耶稣说,我是神来到你这里。你永远不会足够好。

你永远不会足够道德去到达神那里。我已经来活出你本应该活的生命。我已经来死你本应该死的死亡来为你的罪付代价。我已经一路走来。

相信我。你看,佛陀说,这是道路。耶稣说,我就是道路。佛陀说,我可以向你展示通向神的道路。耶稣说,现实一点。

你永远到不了那里。你永远不会足够好。我是神来到你这里。这是好消息。如果你理解我刚才说的,而你今晚不是基督徒,你最好问问自己,既然我有很多很多很多利益冲突,我有很多很多很多恐惧使我对它的真实性有偏见,请在今晚同意探索。

你们中的一些人认为我说的一切都很愚蠢。我希望你无论如何下次再来。我希望你会思考它。你们中的一些人很惊讶。你们中的一些人说,我需要更多地研究。

你们中的一些人说,我需要更深入地了解这个。我的刻板印象被稍微打破了。我有了新的想法要思考。我在某些方面被说服了。我希望你,如果可以的话,在聚会结束后,留下来参加问答时间,和/或之后去前面的欢迎桌,拿一张小蓝纸,上面会给你一本叫《这位耶稣是谁？》的书。

这是给想知道的人的。给那些不确定他是谁的人。给今晚的客人,出去,填写其中一份表格,把它带到楼下的休息室,你会得到一本与今晚讲座同名的免费书。我们现在要做的是,我要祷告,我们要听一段音乐,紧接着之后我会从人们那里接受两三个问题来开始我们的问答时间。然后我会让你们所有人离开,需要留下的人可以留在前面这里,我们会在之后立即进行问答时间。

让我为你们祷告。我们的天父,我们以祷告结束这个时间,因为我们知道就像耶稣对法利赛人说的,因为你认为你不瞎,你就非常瞎。因为你没有承认你看不见,你就看不见。但如果你承认你看不见,你就开始看见。如果你承认你的偏见,你就在失去你的偏见,我祈求你的灵会帮助人们看到他们看不见,这样他们就可以开始看见。

求你让这里的人们,圣灵啊,帮助人们看到他们的偏见,这样他们就可以放下他们的偏见,这样我们就可以看到耶稣基督在存在意义上是否令人满足,在理智上是否可信。我祈求你的灵会帮助这里的每个人看到这一点,奉耶稣的名祷告。阿们。

今天。我记得当我在大学的时候，有一幅我从未忘记的画面。那是在1970年，我真的不知道这段历史的细节，但我知道在柬埔寨入侵期间，美国东北部的许多大学校园都停课了，学生们基本上抵制了它们，因为他们想谈论生命的意义问题，谈论我们要去向何方。结果，至少在我所在的校园里，每天大学广场上都有开放式麦克风。任何人都可以上去发言，成群的人聚集在那里。

无论你走到哪里，你都会看到一群群的人在一起讨论生命的意义。有一群学生立了一个标语牌。在那个标语牌上，我记得它是黑色底白色字母。上面写着：耶稣基督的复活在理智上是可信的，在存在意义上是令人满足的。多年来我逐渐认识到，这是任何有效世界观、任何有效哲学、任何有效宗教的两个检验标准。

它必须既是理性的、连贯的，它必须是真实的，而且它还必须是相关的，它必须满足我的需求，它必须与我的经验相连接。现在的现代人在谈到宗教或哲学时，有一种倾向不再问第一个问题了。我是说那真的是1970年的事了。现在我们所问的只是，哦宗教，谁知道它是真是假，它对我有用吗？谁知道它在理智上是否可信，我是说毕竟，每个人都有自己的观点。

我想知道的是它在存在意义上对我是否令人满足。恕我直言，我认为这是一种危险的做法。因为我们确实知道一种叫做安慰剂效应的东西，你知道。安慰剂效应是这样的。如果我生病了，我服用了一些我真的相信会让我好转的药物。

但我有非常严重的症状，我正在死于某种疾病。如果我足够相信它，就会产生安慰剂效应。我的一些症状会消失。我会感觉好一些。但从长远来看，安慰剂效应是非常致命的。

因为客观上，它对我的疾病无能为力。而且它可能会让我陷入一种想法，觉得我很好，我没事，我不需要做其他任何事情。如果存在一个灵性客观的宇宙。

如果我现在不是在说有这样一个客观的灵性世界，我也不是在试图向你证明它。我只是说，如果存在一个客观的灵性宇宙，就像物理宇宙一样客观。

那么当你进入某个宗教、某个信仰、某个世界观或哲学体系时——每个人都有一套运作的哲学。每个人都有一套答案来回答我们出了什么问题，我们要往哪里去，人性是什么，终极实在是什么。每个人都有一套运作的哲学。如果你带着这样的态度去面对：唯一重要的就是我相信它，它感觉很棒，它对我有效。那如果存在一种灵性的安慰剂效应呢？

如果它只是让你感觉还不错呢？你知道，每一个宗教，每一种哲学，即使是最疯狂、最离谱、最不连贯的，都能产生一些人说："我现在有了喜乐和生命的意义，因为我加入了这个美好的组织。"每个人，任何人都能产生这种效果。黑手党也能产生这种效果。有收入是好事。

有兄弟也是好事，某种程度上的兄弟。如果存在安慰剂效应呢？如果你暂时感觉良好，但客观上，你正在死于某种东西，而这个信仰与之毫无关系，这个信仰无法处理它。你难道看不出这会有多么破坏性吗？基督教的特点是一种意愿，几乎是一种挑战，向人们说，是的，我们本质上是令人满足的。

世界上有数百万人可以说基督教帮助了我。没有人否认这一点。这是事实。但基督教挑战并说，但不仅仅是本质上令人满足。我们在智识上是可信的。

我们是相关的，因为我们是真实的。这不是现代思维方式的走向。现代思维方式是，如果有效就是真的。基督教说，哦，你难道看不出来吗？那会是一种安慰剂效应。

我们只有在真实的情况下才能最终起作用。不要来到基督教，圣经说，因为它相关，尽管它确实如此。不要来到基督教因为它令人兴奋，尽管它绝对如此。不要来到基督教因为它会满足你的需要，尽管它确实会。来是因为它是真实的。

正因为它是真实的，它才会满足你的需要。它在这个角色中令人兴奋。而如果它是

不是真的，这只是安慰剂效应。那么，你怎么知道基督教是真的呢？这是一个相当大的挑战。

这是一个相当大的挑战，尤其是在今晚这样有限的时间内完成。因此，我想做的是给你一个主要证据的概述，我认为这是压倒性的、无可回避的证据，证明基督教信息的真实性。那就是作为事实的耶稣基督。作为事实的耶稣基督。他是谁？

你看你刚才听到的约翰福音第9章所描述的。耶稣的行为总是让人们提出各种理论。你听到那些理论了吗？这个人是个罪人。等一下，另一个人说。

你知道，我从来没见过罪人能做这种事。这个人是个先知，但这就够了吗？最后，耶稣基督说，我就是医治你的那一位，那个瞎子就跪下来敬拜耶稣。敬拜。你听到了吗？

敬拜。耶稣做了什么？他接受了。他就站在那里。这个人是谁？

什么样的人会接受敬拜？休斯顿·史密斯写了一本伟大的书，叫做《世界伟大宗教》。这是一本老书了。已经存在很长时间了。你知道，这是宗教课程的必读书，一本了不起的书。

《世界伟大宗教》。在那本书中他说，在世界历史上只有两位杰出而有影响力的人物，他们的生命如此令人难以置信、如此巨大。他们生命的事实如此无法解释，以至于他们周围的人不仅仅问，他们是谁？你是谁？而是问，你是什么？

休斯顿·史密斯说，在世界历史上真正有影响力的人中，只有两个人的生命具有如此的美，以至于人们不仅仅说，你是谁？他们问的是，你是什么？这两个人是佛陀和耶稣。史密斯指出，这两个人的回应完全相反，完全对立。在这两种情况下，人们都想敬拜他们，因为他们从未见过这样的慈悲。

他们从未见过这样的正直。他们从未见过这样的生命。他们从未见过这样的美。他们从未见过这样的智慧。他们从未见过任何类似的东西。

史密斯说，人们问，你是什么？他们想要敬拜。而佛陀说，绝对不要，不要敬拜我。我不是神。

佛陀总是不断地说，不要看我。

看我的法，我的教义，我的教导。不要看我。看我的法，我的教义。耶稣，毫不含糊地接受敬拜。耶稣不仅毫不含糊地没有说"我不是神"，他毫不含糊地说的，甚至不是"我是一位神"，他说的是，我就是那位神。

每当有人敬拜时，当多马俯伏说"我的主，我的神"时，当瞎子敬拜时，耶稣站在那里平静地接受了。关于耶稣，有一件事是如此难以解释。世界上有很多人，至少有20个人，我们可以说是世界历史上最有影响力的人物。事实上，耶稣也可能在任何一个由10位最有影响力人物组成的群体中。事实上，你可能可以把耶稣放在前三名。

事实上，甚至可能有共识说他是最有影响力的单一人物，但他是在那个圈子里。他在那个群体中。另一方面，也有许多人声称自己是神。他们声称自己是神。他们声称自己是神圣的人物，但除了一个人之外，他们之间没有重叠。

因为那些声称神性的人总是无法说服任何人，只能说服一群边缘化的、你知道的、失衡的、乌合之众的一小群被剥夺权利的人，相信他们是神。哦，这样的人有几十个。我是神，敬拜我。这样的人有几十个。而他们从未说服过任何人，除了一小群失衡的人。

另一方面，这边有一大群人，他们是世界历史上最有影响力的人物，在几乎所有情况下，当他们谈论自己时，都带着谦卑。不要看我，佛陀说。看我的法。他们总是说，不要敬拜我。不要那样做。

这使他们伟大。这使他们有影响力。除了一个人。有一个人同时在两个类别中。一个人不仅做出了令人难以置信的宣称，而且还让人们相信。

如果世界历史上最有影响力的人物之一声称自己就是神，因此声称每一个人都应当绝对效忠于他

地球上。没有一个有思想的人。没有一个有思想的人能够不去研究它就离开。你不能说我有一个平衡的态度，我对生活有一个深思熟虑的方法。我不是基督徒。

我不相信所有那些关于耶稣是神的东西。但你看，我没有学习很多。我是在这种环境中长大的，但我基本上，你知道，我上过宗教101。我上过哲学101。我基本上意识到我周围大多数聪明人和大多数酷的人都不相信这个。

所以我也不相信。朋友们，耶稣宣称的重大性以及他影响的重大性表明，你最好不要只是怀疑他不是神。神，你最好确知他不是神。这宣称的重大性。听着，如果你收到一封用纽约市一家主要律师事务所的非常正式的信纸写的信，信上说请来见我们。

你是英国王位一位失散已久的继承人。你的第一反应是什么？拜托。我是中国人。拜托。

不可能。然而，你知道，你知道，你甚至不会打个电话。我再给你一个例子。假设你收到国税局的正式信纸，上面说你欠我们40万美元的欠税，你说，不可能。我连4万美元都没挣过。

这怎么可能？然而，你看这宣称的重大性。这宣称的重大性意味着你最好不要只是怀疑它是真的。你最好确知它不是真的，因为如果有可能它是真的而你错过了，你的人生就毁了。当耶稣基督说，我是道路、真理和生命。

除了通过我，没有人能到达终极实相。你最好确知那不是真的。他是个疯子。你看，我的意思是，我不认为每个人都必须研究大卫·科雷什的生平，因为如果他真的是他所说的那个人呢。有很多很多其他像他一样的人，我不认为我们有那么多证据，你知道，来支持他的宣称。

但这是一个，一个，一个人做出了这些宣称，看看他生命的影响。数据，耶稣基督的数据。你看过吗？现在，让我告诉你数据是什么。然后让我告诉你只有五个。

我

只是要快速浏览一遍，因为这基本上就是论证。也许你从未见过一个整体的论证。关于基督教的论证。关于耶稣就是他所说的那位的论证。看看这些数据，只有五种可能的答案，五种解释。

这是谁？我刚刚向你展示了，没有一个理智的人能够不去看这些数据，并决定你相信这五个选项中的哪一个。因为如果你甚至不尝试，如果你只是忽略它，如果你说，好吧，我不知道，我没有看过。你怎么了？

如果你错了，你的生命可能会被毁掉。这个主张的重要性。看看这些数据，只有五种方式可以解释它。这是数据。第一，大约2000年前在巴勒斯坦有一个人，他声称自己是神，他声称自己是弥赛亚，是从天上来的神的儿子，他声称自己正在把天国带到地上。

第一条，第二条，当他带着这个信息四处传讲时，听他说话的人看见他做了看起来像神迹的事情。他们看见他显然用一两个小面包喂饱了5000人。他们看见他在水面上行走。他们看见他使死人复活。他们看见他医治病人。

这是第二条。我不是告诉你他确实行了神迹。我是告诉你数百人看见他显然行了神迹。这引起了难以置信的轰动。你刚才听到描述的约翰福音第9章只是一个例子。

第三，他不仅声称自己是神，而且他说服了与他最亲近的人，与他一起生活的人，使徒们等等，相信他是神。要记住，地球上最不可能相信一个人能够是神的，就是第一世纪的犹太人。因为在东方，他们对神的理解是，神是某种存在于每个人和每件事物中的生命力，所以说一个人是神的某种显现并不是那么不寻常。在西方，罗马人和希腊人有这样的神的理解，有很多神，他们常常伪装，他们常常以人的样子出现，暂时寻欢作乐。我的意思是

可以在神话中看到它，但犹太人，犹太人对上帝超越性的理解，在当时世界的任何地方都是无可匹敌的。

犹太人理解一位不仅内在而且超越的上帝，一位在世界之上的上帝，一位创造了世界的上帝，一位无始的上帝。犹太人在十诫的前两条诫命中被教导了2000年，永远、永远、永远不要敬拜任何被造之物，永远不要敬拜牛犊，永远不要敬拜月亮之子，永远不要。他们被灌输了多年多年多年，他们甚至不使用上帝的名字。那个名字太神圣了，世界上最不可能相信某人是上帝的人群，会是一群第一世纪的犹太人，但不仅如此，世界上最不可能相信你是上帝的人，是那些和你一起睡觉的人。嘿，有各种各样的伟大英雄对吧，每个人都喜欢他们，然后那些和他们一起生活的人出现了，有人给他们一份出书合同，有人写了一篇文章。

这就是为什么在这一栏中有数百个相信上帝的人，他们自己是上帝，他们说他们是上帝，但从未产生任何影响。为什么？因为基本上总有人看到残酷，有人看到自私。有人看到虚伪，有人看到伪善，最不可能让你相信这个人是上帝的人，就是那些和你一起生活的人，和你一起睡觉的人，和你一起工作的人。事实三，围绕耶稣基督的这群人，不仅听到了他宣称自己是上帝，他们还相信了。

事实四，在他死后，数十人和数百人承认并证明他们看到了他复活。不仅所有的使徒，而且我们知道至少有500人同时，保罗在哥林多前书中告诉我们这一点，我们稍后会讲到。同时，看到了他复活。这就是事实四，数十、数十人。有时一次有数百人说，我见过他，他没有死，他复活了。

事实五，那次经历如此深刻地改变了那些男人和女人的生命，以至于他们走出去

世界各地，他们为了传播这个消息而死。他们中的许多人做出了巨大的牺牲。他们中的许多人殉道而死，但他们被彻底改变了，以至于他们到处去，在整个地中海地区传播信仰。五件事。有一个人声称自己是神，他显然行了神迹，他让靠近他的人相信他是神。在他死后，许多人看见他复活了，这些人因为遇见那位复活的救主的经历而被如此彻底地改变，以至于他们到处传播这个消息。

你如何解释这些事实？你如何解释？你如何解释这些数据，解释他是谁？你必须想出一些东西，而只有五种可能性，我会一一列举它们。我要告诉你，前两种是不可能的。

前两个选项是不可能的。我甚至不会说不可能，因为我会称它们为选项。有五个选项，前两个是不可能的，接下来的两个是不太可能的，最后一个是不可避免的。它们都以I开头。前两个，前两个，第一个。

纽约的大多数人都用这种方式来摆脱这些数据，所以我至少要在这上面花几分钟。大多数人说他是一个传说。我们不知道那些事情是否真的发生过。这是纽约人摆脱它的普通方式。我的意思是这样的。

换句话说，就像我说的，我来找你，今晚在座的许多人，我希望在节目结束后我们可以交谈并有一个问答时间等等。你可能会对此反驳我，但我会说大多数人——我会说你如何解释那些数据，你会说我们怎么知道耶稣是谁？我们怎么知道他声称自己是神？我们怎么知道他显然行了神迹？我们怎么知道所有这些事情？

你不知道耶稣基督就像任何有魅力的人一样吗？他的追随者对他感到惊讶，所以在他死后，他们开始编织关于他的故事和传说。你知道你玩过传话游戏吧，你对一个人说，下一个人再说，多年来这些故事变得夸大其词。早期教会开始在这些故事中加入内容，他们开始编造

编造故事，他们开始把满足自己需要的话语塞进耶稣的口中。所以最后这些话在多年之后被写进了新约，但它们是由基督徒写的，他们不是那些有偏见的人。

他们在多年之后写下了这些东西，所以我们不知道耶稣真正说过什么。我们不知道这些东西哪些是真实的，我们不知道这些记载哪些是真实的，你无法读懂新约的历史。他是一个传说，这就是我如何摆脱这些数据的方法。让我给你三个理由说明为什么这不可能。这本身就可以是一个很好的讲座，但我只能给你三个理由说明为什么这不可能。

第一，圣经不是作为传说写成的，圣经是作为历史写成的。很多人喜欢说，好吧你知道，我的意思是看看围绕佛陀的传说，看看佛教著作，看看古兰经，看看这些著作，但这里有一个不同。当你去看新约，比如你去看路加福音。在路加福音的开头，路加这样说。他说许多其他人已经编写了关于耶稣生平的记载，正如那些目击者传给我们的一样。

所以我从一开始就对所有事情进行了仔细的调查，我写了一份有序的记载，这样你们就可以知道这些事情的确定性。他会怎么说？他是在说，看，我不是一个目击者，但我认识很多目击者。所以我仔细地去采访了这些目击者。这是一个像调查记者一样写作的人。

他说我去采访了目击者。我比较了各种记载。我把它们编织成一份有序的记载，这样你们就可以确信这些事情确实发生过。另一位批评家，一位文学批评家这样说。他说当你读新约时，你马上就能看出福音书不是作为传说写成的。

从某种意义上说，他说它们不够好。而且，听着，他是在试图说它们不够好。这就是他的意思。他说如果它们不是历史，那么它们就必须是一种现实主义散文小说，而这种小说实际上

在18世纪之前从未存在过。像约翰福音第8章那样的小插曲，当他们把行淫时被抓的妇人带到耶稣面前时，耶稣在尘土中写字。

这些在故事中没有特别意义的小细节就是标志。明白他在说什么吗？他说今天我们有像小说那样的虚构作品。那是现实主义的散文小说。它会深入细节。

它会说她来到门前。她转动门把手。你知道的，细致入微。这就是我们现在写小说的方式。这个人说，福音书有着所有这些细节，有着像耶稣接待那位被称为行淫的妇人时，他在沙土中写字这样的小陈述。

没有告诉我们他写了什么。这与情节无关。与故事无关。传说不会加入这类小细节。这位批评家说他们当时不是那样写虚构作品的。

路加说这不是传说。路加不是把它当作传说来写的。因此，当你阅读新约福音书时，你必须假定它们要么是绝对刻意的蓄意骗局。它们是谎言，要么是历史记载。没有中间地带。

你准备好说出这一点了吗？现在，这是第一步。摆脱耶稣是传说这种想法，因为第二步是这样的。它们要么是历史，要么是谎言。如果它们是谎言，试试这两件事。

大约到1900年，许多学者说，啊，你知道福音书，它们是在事件发生100年后才写成的。过去80年的研究和考古学已经把时间往前推，往前推，再往前推。所以现在所有学者都会说福音书大约写于公元70年。而且你知道，保罗书信是在事件发生后20年内写成的。这意味着什么。

这意味着非常重要的事情。如果你要编造。如果你要创造故事并说这发生在这座山上，这发生在这一年，那发生在那一年，你让这些说法站得住脚的唯一方法就是等到所有目击证人都死了。1970年，在我的大学校园里，当我们关闭那个地方以便我们可以辩论柬埔寨入侵和

关于其中的道德问题，没有人带着摄像机到处走。我当时认为我们没有摄像机。

我们确实有电影，但我们没有摄像机。没有人坐下来做记录。所以真的没有历史记载。但如果我现在决定，在23年后——这和保罗写他的书信时距离耶稣生平事件的时间一样长——如果我决定写在罢工期间我的大学校园里发生了一场骚乱，有七八个人被杀，那根本不会成立。因为有太多还活着的人在场，他们中有些人已经去世了，但大多数还活着。

他们会说，你在说什么？我读了这本书的书评和《纽约时报书评》，算了吧。不可能的。他们会群起反对，站出来反驳。如果你想捏造什么，你必须等到所有目击证人都死了，这样就没有证实或反驳的可能性了。

所有的新约文献，几乎所有我们所知道的，都是在目击证人有生之年写成的。它们怎么可能是绝对的、完全故意的谎言？保罗在《帖撒罗尼迦前书》15章说，有500人同时看见耶稣基督从死里复活。他们看见他活着。他写这话是在事件发生后20到25年，所有人都同意这一点，所有学者都同意，是在事件之后。

这是一封公开信。这是公开的知识。当有数百人在那里可以说出来的时候，一个信仰怎么可能建立在这样的记载上呢？什么叫坟墓不是空的？看，那就是坟墓。什么叫那些事从来没有发生过？

这500人在哪里？我一个都不认识。你看，它是荒诞的传说，要么是谎言，要么是历史文献。而它是谎言说得通吗？不是，你知道，不是因为它写得太早，而是最后，人们会为骗局而死吗？

想想门徒们。他们所有人都必须参与一个巨大的阴谋。他们会为骗局而死吗？肯尼斯·斯科特·拉图雷特，一位杰出的历史学家，曾在耶鲁大学工作，他曾这样说。他说，为什么在所有的邪教和哲学中

在希腊罗马世界的竞争中，基督教为何能成功并超越所有其他宗教？

为什么它能在遭受比任何其他宗教都更严重的反对的情况下成功？为什么它能在没有权势支持者和高位人士，主要由穷人和奴隶组成的情况下成功？它如何能如此彻底地成功，以至于迫使历史上最强大的国家与之妥协，然后又在试图铲除它的帝国灭亡后依然存续？他总结道，显而易见的是，在基督教的起源处，必定发生了一次巨大的能量释放，这在我们的历史中或许是无与伦比的，没有它，基督教未来的发展轨迹就无法解释。所有这些人都为一个谎言而死，这是有可能的，也许是可能的，绝对有可能，但把这个想法与它被记载的时间放在一起看。

基督教信仰基于这些声称，根本不可能起步。他们不可能说坟墓是空的，除非坟墓确实是空的，因为他们说这话的时间。他们不可能说人们看到耶稣从死里复活，除非他们真的看到祂从死里复活，因为那些人还活着。他们不可能谈论那些神迹。他们不可能说，这位耶稣宣称自己是神的儿子，除非祂确实宣称自己是神的儿子。

抱歉，你不能说。祂是一个传说。你不能说。好吧，有人说，如果我继续读报纸报道，如果它说学者们说我们不知道耶稣基督实际上是什么，耶稣基督真正教导了什么，祂说了什么。是的，我知道。

顺便说一句，他们常常把自己标榜为主流历史学家，但他们不是。他们非常、非常怀疑论，让我这样说吧。如果你基于历史证据怀疑耶稣基督没有说这些话，那么你必须怀疑，你必须说我们无法从过去了解任何事情。你有远比证明凯撒入侵高卢更多、更多的证据来证明耶稣基督说了这些话。远远更多。

我们只有一份关于那件事的记载。我们有四份关于这件事的记载。我们仅有的记载是一份手稿，最早的抄本是事件发生900年后的。

福音书我们有的手稿，距离它们被写成只有几年时间，但区别在这里。存在偏见。

当你研究凯撒的《高卢战记》时，你不会坐下来说，我想知道这是否是真的，因为如果是真的，它将改变我的生活方式。凯撒的《高卢战记》是否真实并不重要。不会影响你的生活方式，但世界上有谁能来到福音书前，看到这些记载并保持客观呢？你难道不知道说"啊，是的，作为一名学者，我可以客观地阅读新约圣经"这话有什么问题吗？你不能。

没有人能。没有人能。因为如果这是真的，不像凯撒的《高卢战记》，你将不得不改变你明天的生活方式。如果这是真的，你就失去了对自己生活的控制。你必须做他所说的。

你必须为他而活。你不能按照你感觉对或错的方式生活。你必须找出他说了什么。你必须跟随他。世界上有谁能在研究这个时保持客观呢？

想象一位法官，她即将审理一个关于某家公司的案件，而控方正试图说这家公司犯有欺诈罪。如果那位法官是该公司的主要投资者呢？如果那位法官在公司被认定欺诈时会损失数千美元呢？常识和这片土地的法律都会说她有既得利益，她有利益冲突，她不能审理此案。但当你阅读圣经并坐下来说这些事情是真是假时，你甚至比她有更多的利益冲突。

如果这被发现是真的，你将失去对整个生活的控制。如果你知道你有这种利益冲突，但无论如何你必须研究它，你必须做出决定，没有其他办法。你最好确保对你的每一个疑虑都反复检查，因为它们可能是偏见。你必须对你的每一点怀疑态度进行反复检查，因为你知道你有巨大的动机不去相信它。这就是为什么我要告诉你们，如此多的学者会对耶稣的历史记载持怀疑态度，却不会对什么

凯撒大帝有战争记载，希罗多德，所有这些记载，苏埃托尼乌斯等等。

他不是一个传说。现在，如果他不是传说，第二个不可能的选项是他不可能是一个好人，他不可能是。你知道他说了什么吗？你读过他的话吗？人们喜欢说，哦，但他只是一位优秀的教师。

他怎么可能是一位优秀的教师？他说，我就是道路、真理、生命，若不藉着我，没有人能到父那里去。他说，如果你想跟随我，如果你想成为我的门徒，你必须恨你的父母。他说，凡想要保全生命的，将要丧失生命，但凡为我的缘故丧失生命的，将要得着生命。

他说，天上地下所有的权柄都赐给我了，我就常与你们同在，直到世界的末了。你知道他在说什么吗？让我用现代语言告诉你。他说，我是通向终极真实的唯一道路。我就是终极真实。

他说，如果你想跟随我，你必须把一切都给我。你对我的爱必须如此之高，以至于你对其他任何事物的爱，甚至是父母、儿女和配偶，相比之下都要像恨一样。如果有任何东西阻止你来到我这里，如果是一只眼睛，就把它扔掉，剜出来。如果是一只手，就把它砍掉。除掉它。

失去我是不值得的。所有的实存，整个宇宙都将向我屈膝。万物都将向我屈膝，如果你来到我这里，万物也将向你屈膝。以前谁说过这样的话？我告诉你一件事，没有好人会说这样的话。

这个人要么是神，要么就像一个自称是荷包蛋的人一样疯狂。一个说自己是荷包蛋的人。他要么是神，要么是一个可怕的骗子，但他不可能是一个好人。拒绝他，憎恨他，刺杀他。但别再说这种荒谬的话，说他是个好人。他不是传说，他不是好人。

然后我们说，啊，好吧，也许他是个骗子，或者也许他是个疯子。但这两个选项都有几个问题，我会把它们放在一起处理，以便结束。主要是因为骗子选项和疯子选项其实是同一个选项。换句话说，你是在说他欺骗了他的追随者。他要么像法利赛人在约翰福音第9章所说的那样是一个非常坏的人，要么他真的是个疯子。

我们在这里遇到了一个问题。原因如下。例如，看看他教导的品质。这不是疯子的胡言乱语。GK·切斯特顿不是这样表述的。

如果我在路上发现一把钥匙，并发现它能打开一把特定的锁。如果我在路上发现一把钥匙，并发现它能打开我家的一把特定的锁，我很可能会认为这把钥匙是由制锁者制作的。如果我发现一套在前现代东方社会中阐述的教导，已证明具有如此普遍的有效性，以至于它在每个世纪都吸引并满足了数百万人，包括历史上最优秀的头脑和最单纯的心灵。它几乎在每一种文化中都找到了归属，在每一个艺术领域都激发了美的杰作，并继续在一个世纪前甚至还没有听说过耶稣基督之名的土地上迅速传播和确立自己。如果这样的教导如此明显地契合这么多时代、这么多地方的这么多人类灵魂的锁，那么它们有可能是骗子或傻瓜的作品吗？

事实上，它们更有可能是由心灵的制造者设计的。那么，看看他的生命。看看他的生命。我们看到这些记载。这是一个骗子或疯子的生命吗？

有人这样说。还没有人发现耶稣应该说而没有说的话。这些记载。你试着想出一句更好的话。你知道要编造这些需要成为什么样的人吗？

如果有人编造了这些，我们就不得不坐在这里对那个编造它的不可思议的人进行同样的讨论了。这会是什么样的人？还没有人发现耶稣应该说而没有说的话，或者他应该做而没有做的事。他所做的没有一件是不够的。事实上，他总是让你惊讶，让你屏息，因为他比你能想象的更好。

为什么？这些是完美的惊喜。他将从未在一起出现过的美德结合在一起，温柔而不软弱，刚强而不严厉，谦卑而丝毫不缺乏自信，圣洁和坚定的信念而丝毫不缺乏亲和力，大能而不

没有麻木不仁，热情却不带偏见，对自满的人施以最严厉的审判，对破碎和边缘的人却展现最迷人的善意，从不自相矛盾，从不走错一步，从不出现任何刺耳的音符。P.T. 福赛思说，如果上帝不是这样，他就不如我们所渴望的上帝，不如这个世界所需要的上帝。

这就是配得全能的圣洁之爱。听着，当我们描述它时，我们就明白了。当我们描述它，甚至仅仅是描述它，你难道不能开始感受到一点点他们所看见的吗？他们跪下敬拜他的原因？当你读福音书时，你就能看到这一点。

你可以看到，正如我们刚才所描述的那样。他们感觉到，他们知道，他们正透过人类肉身的实质，看见上帝的本体。世界上最不可能相信这一点的人就是一世纪的犹太人。是什么力量能让他们相信这一点？还有什么其他选择呢？

圣托马斯·阿奎那是这样说的。他说，唯一的替代方案是相信一个更大的神迹。而那个更大的神迹将是：如果耶稣基督没有发生，那么一个更难以置信的神迹发生了——罗马世界的一半人归信，他们在道德上被转化，达到无私主义和圣洁的新高度，而这一切都是靠历史上最大的谎言。什么才是无可逃避的选择？

不是传说，不可能是好人，这些都是不可能的。不太可能的是，骗子或妄想者。这把我们带到什么地方？它把我们带到这个地方。如果你摆脱对可能的超自然现象的偏见，如果你摆脱对神迹观念的偏见，如果你摆脱那种偏见，相信他所说的自己是谁就很难，但不相信就更难。

相信他所说的自己是谁是困难的，但为了摆脱这一点而必须坚持的理论更加荒谬，有更多的漏洞。因此，我们来到最终的结论，说他一定是他所说的那位。如果这是真的，这意味着第一点。这意味着，除非你对他的反应是极端的，否则你就没有真正遇见真正的耶稣。如果这个房间里有任何人既不恨他，也不畏惧他。

我认为他是最

是有史以来最危险的人，或者另一方面，这个人这里有三只手。或者另一方面，爱他，崇拜他，他为了跟随他而放弃了一切。这是唯一理性的三种回应。你明白吗？因为他的宣称。

你要么应该恨他、攻击他，要么应该害怕他、逃离他，要么应该爱他、在他面前俯伏敬拜。但如果你说，嗯，我不知道我怎么想，或者我觉得我是个基督徒。我希望我能成为更好的基督徒。我不知道我是不是基督徒。你不知道他是谁。

你从未见过真正的耶稣。你所回应的只是你想象中的虚构形象。要面对现实。最后，如果耶稣就是他所说的那位，这是个大好消息。你知道为什么吗？

因为他在说，道德和良善不是道路。你看，佛陀说，我不是神。看我的教导。如果你只是过良善的生活，那就足够了。但另一方面，如果另一方面，如果另一方面，你看到耶稣说，不要看我的教导。

看我。佛陀说，我不是神。我向你指明通往神的道路。耶稣说，我是神来到你这里。你永远不会足够好。

你永远不会有足够的道德来到神那里。我来是要活出你本该活出的生命。我来是要死你本该死的死亡，为你的罪付代价。我已经走完了全程。

相信我。你看，佛陀说，这是道路。耶稣说，我就是道路。佛陀说，我可以向你指明通往神的道路。耶稣说，面对现实吧。

你永远到不了那里。你永远不会足够好。我是神来到你这里。这是好消息。如果你明白我刚才说的，而你今晚还不是基督徒，你最好问问自己，既然我有很多很多很多的利益冲突，我有很多很多很多的恐惧使我对它的真理有偏见，请今晚同意去探索。

你们有些人认为我说的一切都很愚蠢。我希望你无论如何还会再来。我希望你会思考这些。你们有些人感到惊讶。你们有些人说，我需要更多地学习。

你们有些人在说，我需要更深入地了解这些。我的刻板印象被打破了一点。我得到了一些新的想法

思考的。在某些方面我深受触动。如果可以的话，我希望你们在聚会结束后能留下来参加问答时间，或者在聚会后到前面的接待台，拿一张蓝色的小纸条，上面会告诉你一本叫做《这位耶稣是谁？》的书。

这是为那些想要了解的人准备的。那些不确定他是谁的人。今晚作为客人来的人，出去填写其中一份表格，把它带到楼下的休息室，你就会得到一本与今晚讲道同名的免费书籍。现在我们要做的是，我要祷告，我们要听一段音乐，紧接着我会从人们那里接受两三个问题来开始我们的问答时间。然后我会让你们所有人离开，需要留下的人可以留在前面这里，我们会在之后马上进行问答时间。

让我与你们一起祷告。我们的天父，我们以祷告来结束这段时间，因为我们知道，就像耶稣对法利赛人说的，因为你们不认为自己是瞎的，所以你们非常瞎。因为你们没有承认自己看不见，所以你们就看不见。但如果你承认自己看不见，你就开始看见了。如果你承认自己的偏见，你就在失去你的偏见，我祈求你的灵会帮助人们看到他们看不见，好让他们能够开始看见。

你会让圣灵来到这里，帮助人们看到他们的偏见，这样他们就能放下偏见，这样我们就能看清耶稣基督在存在意义上是否令人满足，在理智上是否可信。我祈求你的灵帮助这里的每个人看到这一点，我们奉耶稣的名祷告。阿们。
