### Introduction: The Challenge of Public Faith

How comfortable are you when it comes to being open about your faith? This month on the podcast, Tim Keller looks at what the Bible says about having a public faith. He shows us what it looks like to be open about our faith in a pluralistic society in a way that creates civility and peace and meaningful dialogue with our neighbors.

### The Debate on Jesus' Identity

What we're going to do tonight is look at who is Jesus Christ. What you just heard depicted early dramatically was how the actions and the behavior of Jesus Christ has continually ignited debate about his identity. And all thoughtful people will be part of that debate.

> "The resurrection of Jesus Christ is intellectually credible and existentially satisfying."

**I've come to see over the years that those are the two tests of any valid worldview, of any valid philosophy, of any valid religion, the two tests.** It has to be both rational, coherent, it has to be true, and it also has to be relevant, it has to meet my needs, it has to connect with my experience.

### The Credibility of Christianity

Now modern people have a tendency when it comes to religion or to philosophy, not to ask the first question anymore. I mean that really was 1970. Now all we ask is, oh religion, who knows whether it's true or not, does it work for me?

> "Christianity is characterized by a willingness, almost a dare, a challenge to people to say, yes, we're essentially satisfying."

**Christianity challenges and says, but it's not just the works essentially satisfying. We're intellectually credible. We're relevant because we're true.**

### The Evidence of Jesus Christ

And therefore, what I like to do is give you an overview of the main piece of evidence, which I think is overwhelming and inescapable evidence for the truth of the Christian message. And that is Jesus Christ as datum. Jesus Christ as fact. Who is He?

> "Jesus deeds were always making people come up with theories."

### The Five Possible Explanations

There are only five possible answers, five explanations. Who is this? I've just shown you that no intelligent person can fail to look at the data and decide which of these five options you believe.

1. Legend
2. Good Man
3. Liar
4. Lunatic
5. Lord

**The first two are impossible. The first two options are impossible.**

### Conclusion: The Implications of Jesus' Claims

If Jesus is who he said he is, it's great news. You know why? Because he's saying morality and goodness is not the way. See, Buddha says, I am not God. Look to my teaching. If you just live a good life, that'll be enough.

> "Buddha says, this is the way. Jesus says, I am the way."

**If you understand what I just said, and you're not a Christian tonight, you better ask yourself, since I have lots and lots and lots of conflict of interest, I have lots and lots and lots of fears that make me prejudice against the truth of it, please agree tonight to explore.**

### 引言：公开信仰的挑战

当谈到公开你的信仰时，你有多自在？本月的播客中，Tim Keller 探讨了圣经对公开信仰的看法。他向我们展示了在多元化社会中如何以一种创造文明、和平和有意义的对话的方式公开我们的信仰。

### 关于耶稣身份的争论

今晚我们要做的是看看耶稣基督是谁。你刚才听到的戏剧性描述是耶稣基督的行为和举止如何不断引发关于他身份的争论。所有有思想的人都会参与到这场争论中。

> “耶稣基督的复活在智力上是可信的，在存在上是令人满意的。”

**多年来我逐渐认识到，这些是任何有效世界观、任何有效哲学、任何有效宗教的两个测试。**它必须既理性、连贯，必须是真实的，同时也必须是相关的，必须满足我的需求，必须与我的经验相连接。

### 基督教的可信性

现在现代人在涉及宗教或哲学时往往不再问第一个问题。我是说，那真的是1970年。现在我们只问，哦，宗教，谁知道它是否真实，它对我有用吗？

> “基督教的特点是愿意，几乎是一种挑战，向人们说，是的，我们本质上是令人满意的。”

**基督教挑战并说，但不仅仅是本质上令人满意。我们在智力上是可信的。我们是相关的，因为我们是真实的。**

### 耶稣基督的证据

因此，我想给你一个主要证据的概述，我认为这是基督教信息真实性的压倒性和不可避免的证据。那就是耶稣基督作为数据。耶稣基督作为事实。他是谁？

> “耶稣的行为总是让人们提出理论。”

### 五种可能的解释

只有五种可能的答案，五种解释。这是谁？我刚刚向你展示了没有一个聪明人可以不看数据就决定你相信这五种选择中的哪一种。

1. 传奇
2. 好人
3. 撒谎者
4. 疯子
5. 主

**前两个是不可能的。前两个选项是不可能的。**

### 结论：耶稣宣称的意义

如果耶稣是他说的那样，那是个好消息。你知道为什么吗？因为他说道德和善良不是道路。看，佛陀说，我不是神。看我的教导。如果你只是过上好生活，那就足够了。

> “佛陀说，这是道路。耶稣说，我就是道路。”

**如果你理解我刚才说的，并且今晚你不是基督徒，你最好问问自己，因为我有很多很多的利益冲突，我有很多很多的恐惧让我对真相有偏见，请今晚同意去探索。**
