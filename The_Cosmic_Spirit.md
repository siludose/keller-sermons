Welcome to Gospel and Life! Who is the Holy Spirit? And why is the Spirit's work so vital to the Christian life? The Bible tells us the Holy Spirit is not just a vague force, but a person who works in  the lives of Christians in profound ways. Today Tim Keller is exploring how the Spirit calls us to faith, unites us together, equips  us with gifts and shapes us to be more like Christ.

Tonight's scripture is from the Book of Romans, chapter 8, verses 15 through 27. For you did not receive a Spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received  the Spirit of sonship, and by him we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirits that we are God's children. Now if we are children, then we are heirs, heirs of God and coheirs with Christ, if indeed  we share in his sufferings an order that we may also share in his glory. I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will  be revealed in us.

The creation waits an eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of  the one who subjected it. And hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into  the glorious freedom of the children of God. We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right  up to the present time. Not only so, but we ourselves who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as  we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.

We are in this hope we were saved, but hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he already has? But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently. In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with  groans that words cannot express.

And He who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit because the Spirit intercedes  for the saints and accordance with God's will. This is the Word of the Lord. We've been doing a series on the Holy Spirit and tonight we come to the end of the series. And we've looked at a number of pretty well known things that the Holy Spirit does in  us and for us. He calls us and enables us to believe.

He regenerates us and creates Christ-like character in us. He unites us one to another inside the church. He empowers us with his gifts so that we can serve people around us in life-changing  ways. Those are all pretty well known, but tonight we look at a passage that tells us about  the ultimate thing, the final thing, if the Holy Spirit does for us. And it's maybe the most astonishing of all, and not nearly as well known.

Let's notice from the text what we learn here is what the Spirit will do for us in the  future, what the Spirit therefore can do for us in the present, and how we can let the  Spirit do that in our lives. What He will do for us in the future, what He therefore can do for us now in the present,  and how we can let the Spirit do that in our lives. What are we talking about? Well, first, what the Spirit will do in the future. And in a nutshell, chapter 8 of Romans is an amazing chapter, and a little further  down on chapter 8 and verse 30, we read where it says, he, the Lord, those he called, he  also justified, but those he justified, he also glorified.

He doesn't just stop at justification, he justified as he also glorifies. We are going to be glorified. One of the most confusing things about the reading Paul is he constantly changes the  tenses on salvation on us. So sometimes he says, you have been saved, we have been saved, we have been redeemed,  we are redeemed, past tense, then suddenly all of a sudden he turns around and says,  it's sometimes in the same sentence, but we will be redeemed, we will be saved. So which is it?

In fact, he does it here, did you see it? Because in verses 14, 15, and 16, he says, as believers in Christ, we are his children. We have been adopted. We have received the Spirit of Sonship. We have been adopted.

We are his children. And yet, look at verse 23, it says, we wait eagerly for our adoption. There he did it again. What's the matter with this man? And the answer is the richness of the concept.

See, the word redemption, especially that is the word that's operative in here, means  to be purchased, ransomed out of bondage, to be bought out of slavery, to be ransomed  out of bondage or slavery. Now, the being bondage means to literally be in chains, not to be free, to be who you  are supposed to be, not to be free, to do the things you're supposed to do. And what we know from the Bible throughout, even at the very beginning in Genesis chapter 3,  is that when we sinned and lost our relationship with God, we lost all other relationships. When we lost our relationship with God, everything else broke. Nothing else is the way God designed it to be, and therefore, we are in bondage in every  area of our life, where we are not free to be all the things that God meant us to be.

In other words, we are in bondage psychologically and sociologically and relationally and physically. What do I mean? Even the best Christians, even the most mature Christians, still experience an enormous  amount of bondage to fear, anxiety, hardness of heart. They certainly experience a certain amount of freedom, but they still experience that. Even the best churches still experience a great deal of conflict and egos and fights and prejudice.

And even the very best people still get sick, get old, and die. And none of those things are the way God originally designed them to be. None of them, all that suffering, all that brokenness is not what God meant us to be. And therefore, the minute you become a Christian, all your sins are forgiven. There's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.

God sees you in Christ, which means He treats you as if you've done everything Christ has done. You are absolutely as justified in His sight, the first moment you believe and as loved  as you will be a billion years from now. And in all, in that sense, and in that's a profound sense, you are saved, past ends. And yet, though you have been redeemed, in that sense, you still need redemption. They're still bondage.

We have been redeemed, but we need to be redeemed, and we will be. Because we're told in verse 17, though we're in suffering, though we're in bondage,  we will be glorified, which means all the effects of sin, all the bonds will be over,  and in particular, it's verse 23, we will have our bodies redeemed. We await eagerly the redemption, the final adoption, the final salvation, the redemption  of our bodies. Now, the Greeks, the old Greek philosophers, believe the body was bad, and the ultimate  salvation was for the soul to be freed from the body. The body is bad, the body is broken, the body is weak, and the ultimate salvation is to  be freed from the body.

And I must tell you, the older I get, the more I sympathize with that idea, the more you  see me. Because if you're chronically ill or if you're just getting older and you're just, and you  just sense more and more the weakness of your body, you can start to say, this is, this  isn't, the body is my enemy. It's a prison house. Salvation would be to be free of it, but that's not how the Bible sees it. Do you see what this is saying?

Your final redemption is not even going to heaven. Your final redemption is at the end of time when you're resurrected and you have a new  and glorious body. That's the final joy, the final blessing. That's the fullness of what God wants you to have. That's the fullness of the joy and the flourishing that God wants you to know as a human being.

And this is the work of the Spirit. It's the Spirit doing this. Romans 8 verse 11. It's a little higher up than what we began where we began to read says this. And if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, He who raised  Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit.

Who lives in you? The Spirit that comes into you when you first believe some day is going to transform  your body. Philippians 3.21, then the body of our humiliation. This frail form will be conformed to the image of Christ's glory. You say, what will that be like?

Well, we actually know a little bit about it. Not only do we have Jesus Christ and what He was like after His resurrection, and He's  the first fruit from the dead, which means He's the one person that we have some idea about  what it means to have a glorious resurrected body, free from the imperfection, free from  all bondage to decay, free from anything wrong. But we also have 1 Corinthians 15 where Paul says some of these great things. This mortal body will put on immortality. It is sown in dishonor, it will be raised in splendor.

It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power, it is sown in natural body, it is raised  in spiritual body, right there. See what that's saying? Here's your resurrected glory future. Do you want to know what it looks like? Do you know what it's going to be like?

You probably can think too much about this because you can get into speculation what  we would be able to do this or that. But our problem is that we actually think too little about it. Here's three things we know about your future resurrected body. It'll be our body, it'll be a beautiful body, it'll be a powerful body. It'll be our body, remember what Paul said.

This mortal body will put on immortality. When Jesus rose from the dead and he appeared as he was disciples, he still had his nail  prints, remember that? How could that be? It's because it was his body, his mortal body putting on immortality. He was still him, that's the reason why when people looked at Jesus after his resurrection.

At first they didn't recognize Him and then they did. You know one of the most irritating things for those of you who are like maybe in your  20s, you're constantly running into older people in their 40s and 50s who knew you when  you were a kid but hadn't seen you since you grew up. It's a little icky because you come up to them and you say, hi, do you know me? No. Well, I'm so and so and then they look at you, they haven't seen you since your 8th,  now you're 25 or something like that.

And they go, you're little Jimmy or little Sally and it's really awful, it's really  awful. But the point is it is still you, it is your 8 year old self transformed by a process  of growth. They can see it, your body, your face, your eyes, oh yeah, how about look at you? That's what it's going to be like. We're going to be ourselves, we're really going to be us.

I mean that's an amazing, there is no other religion in the world that has that kind of  self. We're going to be us, it's going to be our body putting on immortality. You know in this world we have that idea but in that world it'll be like when we see  each other we're going to say, it is you, I always know you could be like this. I saw glimpses of it but now look at you, it'll be you, it'll be us. So it'll be our body, secondly it'll be a beautiful body, it's sewn in dishonor, Paul says  and it's raised in splendor.

In this world there are people with ugly souls that have beautiful bodies and there's people  with beautiful souls that have ugly bodies but not then. C.S. Lewis says, if we let him he will make the feeblest and filthiest of us into a dazzling,  radiant immortal creature, pulsating all through with such energy and joy and wisdom and  love as we cannot now imagine. He can make us into bright, stainless mirrors which reflect back to God perfectly though  of course on a smaller scale his own boundless power and delight and goodness. That is what we are in for, nothing less, a mirror reflecting back but there's another  way to do it.

His friend, Lewis's friend J.R. Tolkien in one place and one of his fictional pieces,  one of his characters dies and when he dies he lies in state and this is what it says  about. Tolkien and Lewis were Christians struggling to come to grips with what the future glory  looked like and we're told this man dies and he's lying in state and this is what it's  how he describes him. A great beauty was revealed in him and all who came there looked on him in wonder, for  they saw that the grace of his youth, the valor of his manhood, the wisdom and majesty  of his age were all blended together and long there he lay an image of the kings of  men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world. So what Tolkien is trying to get across is for example see there is a beauty that children  have that they lose but then there's another beauty that young men and women have you know  in their prime, physical prime that the children didn't have and that older people don't  have but then there's a majesty and a wisdom and a nobility about older people that the  younger people don't have but in all these beauties and these glories of course are just  sort of spread out but then they'll all be united.

They'll all be united. Paul says we will be different, we'll be ourselves and yet he says star differs from  star and glory. Every star is different, they're all, every single one of them is different. They'll all be different but will be stars and not only that will not only be our bodies  and not only will be beautiful bodies but they will be powerful. Paul says it is sewn in weakness.

The body is sewn in weakness but it's raised in power and then he goes a little further  and says it's sewn in natural body, it's raised a spiritual body. What is that? In fact think about that, isn't that a category mistake? It's raised a spiritual body, that doesn't make any sense. See in our categories you either a spirit or your body, you're either a spirit or your  body.

Well come on Paul, will we be spirits or will we be bodies and Paul says yeah. In fact Jesus comes through the doors, he comes through locked doors and they say oh  it's a ghost remember this, Luke 24, the resurrected Christ comes through locked doors  and they say oh as a ghost he says give me a fish and he eats the fish, he says I have a spirit  have not flesh and bones, touch me, watch me, a spiritual body, run it not be weary, walk  and not faint, right now you've got five senses, what if there is a thousand senses  will have? Who knows? Let us know, let us now draw the veil over this because I don't know that we can, we  know much more in the way of details. But do you think about your future, resurrected, perfect bodies and glory cells?

I'm sure it's possible to think too much about it but I don't think that's most of, I  don't think that's the problem that most of us have. The reason why you're so angry because you haven't lost the weight and it looks like  you're never going to be as good looking or as fit or as glorious as you want to be is  because you're not thinking. We need to be good stewards of our body, be as good a steward as you possibly can but  don't put your hopes there. The power you want, the glory you want, you know, there's a you in there that will never  come out till this moment, till the spirit gives life to your mortal body, to the redemption  we wait and eat your longing for the redemption of our bodies. But that's not all by the way, that is not all.

The world in which we're going to live when the spirit does its work is a renewed natural  world. Verse 19, just for a minute, just to point out that along with the resurrection of our  bodies comes verses 19, 20 and 21, which is absolutely astonishing. Tomorrow is giving Tuesday and we want you to know about a special opportunity we have  this year. As you may know, gospel and life supports Redeemer City to City, a ministry dedicated  to growing gospel movements in cities around the world through church planting. City to City was co-founded by Tim Keller and he cared deeply about this mission.

And this coming year at a 2026 training event in Kenya, City to City will help train, coach  and support two cohorts of 20 pastors planting churches all over Africa. This giving Tuesday, we have a goal to raise $150,000 to help sponsor the church planters  attending this training intensive in Nairobi, Kenya, so that City to City can help and support  these church planters to start churches across Africa. This work is vital to the spread of the gospel in African cities from Kampala to Lagos to  Johannesburg. So, as you think about how you may give on giving Tuesday, please consider making a gift  to gospel in life. Every dollar we receive on giving Tuesday will go directly to the work City to City is  doing to help start new churches in Africa in 2026.

To make a gift tomorrow, visit gospelonlife.com slash Tuesday. Again, as gospelonlife.com slash Tuesday. And thank you for your generous and faithful support of this ministry. Now, here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's message.  1921, what's it say?

It says the creation, and that's by the way, the natural world. That's the mountains and the animals, you know, and the trees. It says the creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to frustration not by its own choice, but by the will of  the one who subjected it in hope, that the creation itself will be liberated from bondage  to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God. What?

What? It says three things. And actually, we don't know much about those three things, but we do know these three  things. It says that nature, the natural world, is not what it should be because of us. Somehow, our sin has brought about a fallenness in nature, so even nature is not what it should  be.

It's frustrated. It's not all that God meant it to be. It's in bondage to decay. That's the first thing. Secondly, it knows it.

It knows it's not what it should be, and it's longing to be liberated. And what in the world does Paul mean by that? How could the trees in the animal? What is he saying? And of course, on the one hand, I hope you know, he's not doing fairy tale stuff.

He's not saying, well, you know, the trees in the animals could talk, but when you're around  they don't. He's not saying that, but I'll tell you what he is saying. He is saying that the creation has a life of its own. It's made also by God to glorify him, just like you are. From 19 says the heavens, this natural world glorifies God, and as such, they are fellow  creatures, the trees in the animals, and they have a life of their own, and they deserve  an enormous amount of respect.

But here's one of the reasons why. Somehow the creation, in its own way, knows it's creator better than you and I. Some years ago, that's what it's saying. Some years ago, remember, Elizabeth Elley had a teacher of mine at Gordon Conwell Seminary  years ago. Someone said, if you understood these things, she said, you would be humble before a very  clam.

You know why? Because the clams are doing a better job of being the clams, God meant them to be, than  you are, being the man or the woman God meant you to be. You fall far shorter from what we're supposed to be. You fall short. Are you the man God wants you to be?

But no, clams are much closer. They're glorifying God far more than you are. They, in a sense, know the creation knows there's something wrong, and it's long for the  resurrection in a way the human race is not. But when did you see the last line there, the last part? The creation will be liberated from its bondage decay, decay how?

It'll be brought into our freedom, and what that means is. And the Holy Spirit descends upon us to give us the redemption, the final redemption,  the final glorification of ourselves and our bodies. It's going to be an explosion of such love and power and glory that will bring all of  nature with it. Nature will come into what it should be on our co-tales. Isn't this something?

And let me just do a little reasoning with you for a second. He's saying, God says, for example, in Exodus 19 to his people, you are my treasured possession  though the whole earth is mine, Exodus 19. You are my treasured possession to the whole earth is mine. What he's saying is, as much as I love the earth, as much as I love the stars and the  moons, as much as I love the mountains and the trees and the animals, as much as I love  the earth, I love you the most. You are the most treasured possession, and you know what this means?

It's nature that actually comes in on our co-tales, what that means is this. It's astounding to me when you go out and look at the beauty of nature, when you look  at the beauty of the mountains and the beauty of the ocean to think that it's just a shadow  of what it's going to be. Current nature is just a shadow of its future, glorious self, right? And yet we are going to be more glorious than the future, renewed nature. And that's what the Holy Spirit will do.

Because the Holy Spirit's job is to get rid of the suffering, get rid of the bondage,  get rid of the brokenness, get rid of the groaning. That's what it's going to do in the future, so you say, ah, does that mean that's it? We just have to wait for that. We're groaning now, we're suffering now. Notice that?

We in really groan, nature is groaning. And the word groaning, by the way, that comes up three or four times in here is a word  that means to be in pain. People groan when they're dying, people groan when they're in labor, people groan when  they're in terrible, searing pain. Now we live in a time of groaning now, we groan, nature groans. So we say, okay, eventually all the groaning will be over, all the suffering will be over,  that's the job of the Spirit wonderful, but right now we're on our own, no.

Here we are in point two, by the way, those of you who care. The Holy Spirit's job is to deal with suffering and groaning. It's to deal with the brokenness of our lives. That's what we're being told, and eventually he's going to deal with it completely, but  he doesn't leave us on our own now, oh no. He's already in our lives to help us with the groaning.

We groan inwardly and we're in trouble. You know, remember the line from the great poet, it's, you know, things fall apart. The center cannot hold. Mayor Anarchy is loose upon the world. That's true.

Everything's falling apart. Your body's falling apart. Your relationships are falling apart. Your families are falling apart. Your communities are falling apart.

Everything's falling apart. Institutions, movements, they all fall apart. He said, what do you mean? They die. People move.

People fight. There's an entropy about everything in this world. We groan. Things are always falling apart, but the Holy Spirit has come into our lives as the first  fruits of that future glory. See, verse 23, not only so, but we ourselves who have the first fruits of the Spirit.

That word first fruit is so crucial. What that first fruit means, the first day's gathering from the harvest, even though they're  going to spend two more weeks and they're going to bring in all the wheat or they're  going to bring in all the corn. But the first day, you gather the corn or the wheat that's coming, you gather some now  and you eat it. It's a foretaste of the future feast. It's a down payment on the future fortune.

It's a real piece of the future. And what we're told is, with the Holy Spirit, this wonderful person and power who in the  future is going to deal with our groanings and suffering completely is in our lives now. We get a foretaste of that glory that enables us to handle the groanings and suffering  of life now. That's what this text is telling us. And in two ways, I'll use the image of sailing and rowing.

You know, sailing, you move through because the wind is to your back. In rowing, you've got no wind or maybe the wind in your face, but with exertion, you  can still get home. So when you're in the midst of groaning and suffering, there's two ways that the Holy  Spirit helps you, but He does. The first one is at the top versus 15, 16, 17. It says, the Spirit bears witness with our spirits that we're children of God.

It shores us that we're His children. In fact, it says, the Spirit testifies with our spirit that we, by Him, by the Spirit,  we cry Abba. The word Abba is the Aramaic term for daddy or papa. And what that means is, the Spirit gives us such confidence that God loves us, that we're  able to rely on Him and reach out to Him the way a little child reaches out to the Father. And see, that's what I mean by sailing.

Sometimes, in spite of all the troubles around us, God gives us this joy, this sense of His  reality, by the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Sonship, crying Abba, assurance that we're His,  but not always. Sometimes the Holy Spirit helps us in more difficult times than that. Sometimes the only way to get home is not through sailing because nothing's working. Somebody of the things that the Holy Spirit does, He changes you through the fruit of the  Spirit. He illuminates you by helping you understand God.

He empowers you to use your gifts, but sometimes nothing's going right at all. You're not seeing anybody change your life. God doesn't seem real to you, prayer is dry. You're not getting any prayers answered. And yet the Spirit doesn't abandon you.

Look at verse 26 and 27, in the same way, there's just 26, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with  groans that words cannot express. Sometimes we don't even know what to pray for. See, that's where we're in the depths. We don't even know what to pray for.

We're so overwhelmed with our troubles. We're groaning, you might say, so deeply and so loudly. And yet the Spirit is with us in those times, and I think over the years as I've thought  about that, I, in other words, sometimes the Spirit doesn't give us the joy that knows  no bounds. Sometimes the Spirit just gives us the peace that passes understanding so we can keep  rowing, so we can just keep doing the next thing, so we can just know God's with us even  now we don't feel them. You know how many of those Psalms, there's 150 Psalms, but I tell you, an awful lot of,  like half of them, or the Psalmist starts off by wrestling unhappy, angry, what's going  on?

I don't understand. Things are terrible. Oh, Lord, why are you letting all this happen? But the very end, he says, he wrestles through the end and says, but I know I believe I will  see the goodness of the Lord and the land of the living. And I think what he's, what happens is he just knows in his soul in spite of the fact  that everything else seems to be saying there is no God or God doesn't care or who cares  about God in his soul, he says, no, no, no, no, no, I know, I know, I know he's there,  I know he's not going to leave me like this, I'm going to do the next thing, I'm going  to pray, I'm going to read my Bible even though I'm not getting anything out of it.

You're rowing, and it's because of the Spirit's there helping you. The Spirit cares about your groaning and your suffering, that's his job. Some day to end it all, but even now to help you. Now let's not, we're not done, and here's the reason why. If you're a New Yorker is your practical, and New Yorkers say, this is all very inspiring,  but how do I really, how do I actually do this?

How do I do this? You talk about this wonderful future and this wonderful future, but it's supposed to  be somehow helping me now. I don't see how. How can I know? Well, here's the way.

The thing that activates the future so that it affects you now is assured hope. Verse 24, 25, in this hope we are saved, but if we hope for what we do not yet have, we  wait for it patiently. There's your, that's what you need, patience, poise, stick tillidiveness, how? It's through hope. Do you know how important hope is?

Hope is an assured future. Imagine two women, and both of them have a purse, and in that purse is all the assets and  money they have in the world. Everything they have in the world is in that purse, $1,000 in cash, that's it, they both  have $1,000 in cash, that's all they have. The difference is that woman knows that tomorrow, for some reasons, a $10 million will  be wired into her bank account. And the other woman knows that there's nothing coming from anybody for the indefinite future.

And imagine those two women go out in New York City and they both have the very same experience  somebody snatches their purse, their purses are lost, they're taken, they're stolen. How are they going to respond to that? I can tell you this, the woman who knows that tomorrow, $10 million is coming to her  bank account, says, what an inconvenience, oh well. And the other woman is in total despair. Do you know why?

Same circumstances, why is the response so different? Because what you know about the future completely determines how you process the present. What you know about the future, your understanding of your own future completely determines how  you process the present. How can you know that the redemption of your body is coming? How can you know that that's your future?

If you knew it, if you were sure of it, you could face anything because a whole lot better  than $10 million is coming into your bank account. How can you be sure? Here's how you can be sure. Many people, commentators have been wondering, so over the years, how could the Spirit  groan? You notice in verse 26, it says that when the Spirit is with us and all of our trouble,  it says, the Spirit intercedes for us with groans, which means the Spirit is suffering.

And many commentators are saying, how could the divine and mortal Spirit of God suffer? Jesus, in Mark chapter 7, takes a little deaf mute, a man who's been really suffered  his whole life aside. He wants to heal him. And as he's about to heal him, he looks to heaven, and he groans, the same word. That means he's in pain.

Why? Why doesn't he just say, ha ha, way to you see what I'm going to do? Why? Why is he groaning in pain? Well, the first answer is, because here's a man who's so loving and so vulnerable in  his love, that he can emotionally identify with a suffering man that he's just met.

And he feels the man's suffering himself. But the ultimate reason is he knows that in order to deliver him and us from his groaning  and suffering, Jesus is himself going to have to be plunged into suffering and groaning  to deficit. No one else has ever been, you know, sent. Because when Jesus on the cross says, my God, my God, why has the offer shaken me? He's quoting Psalm 22, right?

But Psalm 22, verse 1, which would have been in Jesus head as he's dying, here's the  full verse. My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me? So far from the words of my groaning, Jesus groaned in pain and got abandoned him. I'm groaning and got abandoned him.

Why? Because he got the abandonment that our sins deserve so that you can know, know, that whenever  you groan, God will not abandon you, that he's with you. So you can't face the groaning and suffering of this life without certainty about your  future. And you can't be certain about your future unless you know that because Jesus Christ  died for you and went through that for you, that even though you fail and even though  you don't live the life you ought to live and even though your faith is imperfect and  even though your repentance needs to be repented of, God is there with you, the Holy Spirit  is there with you. He will not abandon you.

The implications of this are astounding, are they not? If God loves the world, this material world like this, should we care for creation and  environment? Yes. If God only, of all the religions of the world, only the Bible says that this world is permanent  and this material world is a permanent and that's a terrific incentive to fight against  disease and hunger, is it not? And if you're facing death, what better?

You can laugh in the face of death with this. And if any of you are chronically sick or even just getting old and almost come to the place  where you feel like my body is my enemy, it's not. I want you to hear that. It's not. It's sin and evil in your body that's the enemy but you're sin and evil's in your soul  and it's in the world and we are without hope unless he gives us the victory, oh God,  he must give us the victory and he will.

Let us pray. Our Father, help us take the theology of this passage. It should make us zealous for caring for material needs. It should make us powerful in the face of our own sickness and even impending death. It should fill us with such hope that we are able to face the worst groaning and suffering  because we know that someday your spirit will end it all.

Father, we like the rest of creation long for the final redemption of our bodies and  until then, holy spirit, help us, help us to have the joy and the peace of past understanding  and the midst of what we have to face. Thank you for all these assurances. Make us people with zeal and joy but who also know how to weep with those who weep because  we know these great truths, we pray this in Jesus' name, Amen.

Welcome to Gospel and Life! Who is the Holy Spirit? And why is the Spirit's work so vital to the Christian life? The Bible tells us the Holy Spirit is not just a vague force, but a person who works in  the lives of Christians in profound ways. Today Tim Keller is exploring how the Spirit calls us to faith, unites us together, equips  us with gifts and shapes us to be more like Christ.

Tonight's scripture is from the Book of Romans, chapter 8, verses 15 through 27. For you did not receive a Spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received  the Spirit of sonship, and by him we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirits that we are God's children. Now if we are children, then we are heirs, heirs of God and coheirs with Christ, if indeed  we share in his sufferings an order that we may also share in his glory. I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will  be revealed in us.

The creation waits an eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of  the one who subjected it. And hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into  the glorious freedom of the children of God. We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right  up to the present time. Not only so, but we ourselves who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as  we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.

We are in this hope we were saved, but hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he already has? But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently. In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with  groans that words cannot express.

And He who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit because the Spirit intercedes  for the saints and accordance with God's will. This is the Word of the Lord. We've been doing a series on the Holy Spirit and tonight we come to the end of the series. And we've looked at a number of pretty well known things that the Holy Spirit does in  us and for us. He calls us and enables us to believe.

He regenerates us and creates Christ-like character in us. He unites us one to another inside the church. He empowers us with his gifts so that we can serve people around us in life-changing  ways. Those are all pretty well known, but tonight we look at a passage that tells us about  the ultimate thing, the final thing, if the Holy Spirit does for us. And it's maybe the most astonishing of all, and not nearly as well known.

Let's notice from the text what we learn here is what the Spirit will do for us in the  future, what the Spirit therefore can do for us in the present, and how we can let the  Spirit do that in our lives. What He will do for us in the future, what He therefore can do for us now in the present,  and how we can let the Spirit do that in our lives. What are we talking about? Well, first, what the Spirit will do in the future. And in a nutshell, chapter 8 of Romans is an amazing chapter, and a little further  down on chapter 8 and verse 30, we read where it says, he, the Lord, those he called, he  also justified, but those he justified, he also glorified.

He doesn't just stop at justification, he justified as he also glorifies. We are going to be glorified. One of the most confusing things about the reading Paul is he constantly changes the  tenses on salvation on us. So sometimes he says, you have been saved, we have been saved, we have been redeemed,  we are redeemed, past tense, then suddenly all of a sudden he turns around and says,  it's sometimes in the same sentence, but we will be redeemed, we will be saved. So which is it?

In fact, he does it here, did you see it? Because in verses 14, 15, and 16, he says, as believers in Christ, we are his children. We have been adopted. We have received the Spirit of Sonship. We have been adopted.

We are his children. And yet, look at verse 23, it says, we wait eagerly for our adoption. There he did it again. What's the matter with this man? And the answer is the richness of the concept.

See, the word redemption, especially that is the word that's operative in here, means  to be purchased, ransomed out of bondage, to be bought out of slavery, to be ransomed  out of bondage or slavery. Now, the being bondage means to literally be in chains, not to be free, to be who you  are supposed to be, not to be free, to do the things you're supposed to do. And what we know from the Bible throughout, even at the very beginning in Genesis chapter 3,  is that when we sinned and lost our relationship with God, we lost all other relationships. When we lost our relationship with God, everything else broke. Nothing else is the way God designed it to be, and therefore, we are in bondage in every  area of our life, where we are not free to be all the things that God meant us to be.

In other words, we are in bondage psychologically and sociologically and relationally and physically. What do I mean? Even the best Christians, even the most mature Christians, still experience an enormous  amount of bondage to fear, anxiety, hardness of heart. They certainly experience a certain amount of freedom, but they still experience that. Even the best churches still experience a great deal of conflict and egos and fights and prejudice.

And even the very best people still get sick, get old, and die. And none of those things are the way God originally designed them to be. None of them, all that suffering, all that brokenness is not what God meant us to be. And therefore, the minute you become a Christian, all your sins are forgiven. There's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.

God sees you in Christ, which means He treats you as if you've done everything Christ has done. You are absolutely as justified in His sight, the first moment you believe and as loved  as you will be a billion years from now. And in all, in that sense, and in that's a profound sense, you are saved, past ends. And yet, though you have been redeemed, in that sense, you still need redemption. They're still bondage.

We have been redeemed, but we need to be redeemed, and we will be. Because we're told in verse 17, though we're in suffering, though we're in bondage,  we will be glorified, which means all the effects of sin, all the bonds will be over,  and in particular, it's verse 23, we will have our bodies redeemed. We await eagerly the redemption, the final adoption, the final salvation, the redemption  of our bodies. Now, the Greeks, the old Greek philosophers, believe the body was bad, and the ultimate  salvation was for the soul to be freed from the body. The body is bad, the body is broken, the body is weak, and the ultimate salvation is to  be freed from the body.

And I must tell you, the older I get, the more I sympathize with that idea, the more you  see me. Because if you're chronically ill or if you're just getting older and you're just, and you  just sense more and more the weakness of your body, you can start to say, this is, this  isn't, the body is my enemy. It's a prison house. Salvation would be to be free of it, but that's not how the Bible sees it. Do you see what this is saying?

Your final redemption is not even going to heaven. Your final redemption is at the end of time when you're resurrected and you have a new  and glorious body. That's the final joy, the final blessing. That's the fullness of what God wants you to have. That's the fullness of the joy and the flourishing that God wants you to know as a human being.

And this is the work of the Spirit. It's the Spirit doing this. Romans 8 verse 11. It's a little higher up than what we began where we began to read says this. And if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, He who raised  Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit.

Who lives in you? The Spirit that comes into you when you first believe some day is going to transform  your body. Philippians 3.21, then the body of our humiliation. This frail form will be conformed to the image of Christ's glory. You say, what will that be like?

Well, we actually know a little bit about it. Not only do we have Jesus Christ and what He was like after His resurrection, and He's  the first fruit from the dead, which means He's the one person that we have some idea about  what it means to have a glorious resurrected body, free from the imperfection, free from  all bondage to decay, free from anything wrong. But we also have 1 Corinthians 15 where Paul says some of these great things. This mortal body will put on immortality. It is sown in dishonor, it will be raised in splendor.

It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power, it is sown in natural body, it is raised  in spiritual body, right there. See what that's saying? Here's your resurrected glory future. Do you want to know what it looks like? Do you know what it's going to be like?

You probably can think too much about this because you can get into speculation what  we would be able to do this or that. But our problem is that we actually think too little about it. Here's three things we know about your future resurrected body. It'll be our body, it'll be a beautiful body, it'll be a powerful body. It'll be our body, remember what Paul said.

This mortal body will put on immortality. When Jesus rose from the dead and he appeared as he was disciples, he still had his nail  prints, remember that? How could that be? It's because it was his body, his mortal body putting on immortality. He was still him, that's the reason why when people looked at Jesus after his resurrection.

At first they didn't recognize Him and then they did. You know one of the most irritating things for those of you who are like maybe in your  20s, you're constantly running into older people in their 40s and 50s who knew you when  you were a kid but hadn't seen you since you grew up. It's a little icky because you come up to them and you say, hi, do you know me? No. Well, I'm so and so and then they look at you, they haven't seen you since your 8th,  now you're 25 or something like that.

And they go, you're little Jimmy or little Sally and it's really awful, it's really  awful. But the point is it is still you, it is your 8 year old self transformed by a process  of growth. They can see it, your body, your face, your eyes, oh yeah, how about look at you? That's what it's going to be like. We're going to be ourselves, we're really going to be us.

I mean that's an amazing, there is no other religion in the world that has that kind of  self. We're going to be us, it's going to be our body putting on immortality. You know in this world we have that idea but in that world it'll be like when we see  each other we're going to say, it is you, I always know you could be like this. I saw glimpses of it but now look at you, it'll be you, it'll be us. So it'll be our body, secondly it'll be a beautiful body, it's sewn in dishonor, Paul says  and it's raised in splendor.

In this world there are people with ugly souls that have beautiful bodies and there's people  with beautiful souls that have ugly bodies but not then. C.S. Lewis says, if we let him he will make the feeblest and filthiest of us into a dazzling,  radiant immortal creature, pulsating all through with such energy and joy and wisdom and  love as we cannot now imagine. He can make us into bright, stainless mirrors which reflect back to God perfectly though  of course on a smaller scale his own boundless power and delight and goodness. That is what we are in for, nothing less, a mirror reflecting back but there's another  way to do it.

His friend, Lewis's friend J.R. Tolkien in one place and one of his fictional pieces,  one of his characters dies and when he dies he lies in state and this is what it says  about. Tolkien and Lewis were Christians struggling to come to grips with what the future glory  looked like and we're told this man dies and he's lying in state and this is what it's  how he describes him. A great beauty was revealed in him and all who came there looked on him in wonder, for  they saw that the grace of his youth, the valor of his manhood, the wisdom and majesty  of his age were all blended together and long there he lay an image of the kings of  men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world. So what Tolkien is trying to get across is for example see there is a beauty that children  have that they lose but then there's another beauty that young men and women have you know  in their prime, physical prime that the children didn't have and that older people don't  have but then there's a majesty and a wisdom and a nobility about older people that the  younger people don't have but in all these beauties and these glories of course are just  sort of spread out but then they'll all be united.

They'll all be united. Paul says we will be different, we'll be ourselves and yet he says star differs from  star and glory. Every star is different, they're all, every single one of them is different. They'll all be different but will be stars and not only that will not only be our bodies  and not only will be beautiful bodies but they will be powerful. Paul says it is sewn in weakness.

The body is sewn in weakness but it's raised in power and then he goes a little further  and says it's sewn in natural body, it's raised a spiritual body. What is that? In fact think about that, isn't that a category mistake? It's raised a spiritual body, that doesn't make any sense. See in our categories you either a spirit or your body, you're either a spirit or your  body.

Well come on Paul, will we be spirits or will we be bodies and Paul says yeah. In fact Jesus comes through the doors, he comes through locked doors and they say oh  it's a ghost remember this, Luke 24, the resurrected Christ comes through locked doors  and they say oh as a ghost he says give me a fish and he eats the fish, he says I have a spirit  have not flesh and bones, touch me, watch me, a spiritual body, run it not be weary, walk  and not faint, right now you've got five senses, what if there is a thousand senses  will have? Who knows? Let us know, let us now draw the veil over this because I don't know that we can, we  know much more in the way of details. But do you think about your future, resurrected, perfect bodies and glory cells?

I'm sure it's possible to think too much about it but I don't think that's most of, I  don't think that's the problem that most of us have. The reason why you're so angry because you haven't lost the weight and it looks like  you're never going to be as good looking or as fit or as glorious as you want to be is  because you're not thinking. We need to be good stewards of our body, be as good a steward as you possibly can but  don't put your hopes there. The power you want, the glory you want, you know, there's a you in there that will never  come out till this moment, till the spirit gives life to your mortal body, to the redemption  we wait and eat your longing for the redemption of our bodies. But that's not all by the way, that is not all.

The world in which we're going to live when the spirit does its work is a renewed natural  world. Verse 19, just for a minute, just to point out that along with the resurrection of our  bodies comes verses 19, 20 and 21, which is absolutely astonishing. Tomorrow is giving Tuesday and we want you to know about a special opportunity we have  this year. As you may know, gospel and life supports Redeemer City to City, a ministry dedicated  to growing gospel movements in cities around the world through church planting. City to City was co-founded by Tim Keller and he cared deeply about this mission.

And this coming year at a 2026 training event in Kenya, City to City will help train, coach  and support two cohorts of 20 pastors planting churches all over Africa. This giving Tuesday, we have a goal to raise $150,000 to help sponsor the church planters  attending this training intensive in Nairobi, Kenya, so that City to City can help and support  these church planters to start churches across Africa. This work is vital to the spread of the gospel in African cities from Kampala to Lagos to  Johannesburg. So, as you think about how you may give on giving Tuesday, please consider making a gift  to gospel in life. Every dollar we receive on giving Tuesday will go directly to the work City to City is  doing to help start new churches in Africa in 2026.

To make a gift tomorrow, visit gospelonlife.com slash Tuesday. Again, as gospelonlife.com slash Tuesday. And thank you for your generous and faithful support of this ministry. Now, here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's message.  1921, what's it say?

It says the creation, and that's by the way, the natural world. That's the mountains and the animals, you know, and the trees. It says the creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to frustration not by its own choice, but by the will of  the one who subjected it in hope, that the creation itself will be liberated from bondage  to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God. What?

What? It says three things. And actually, we don't know much about those three things, but we do know these three  things. It says that nature, the natural world, is not what it should be because of us. Somehow, our sin has brought about a fallenness in nature, so even nature is not what it should  be.

It's frustrated. It's not all that God meant it to be. It's in bondage to decay. That's the first thing. Secondly, it knows it.

It knows it's not what it should be, and it's longing to be liberated. And what in the world does Paul mean by that? How could the trees in the animal? What is he saying? And of course, on the one hand, I hope you know, he's not doing fairy tale stuff.

He's not saying, well, you know, the trees in the animals could talk, but when you're around  they don't. He's not saying that, but I'll tell you what he is saying. He is saying that the creation has a life of its own. It's made also by God to glorify him, just like you are. From 19 says the heavens, this natural world glorifies God, and as such, they are fellow  creatures, the trees in the animals, and they have a life of their own, and they deserve  an enormous amount of respect.

But here's one of the reasons why. Somehow the creation, in its own way, knows it's creator better than you and I. Some years ago, that's what it's saying. Some years ago, remember, Elizabeth Elley had a teacher of mine at Gordon Conwell Seminary  years ago. Someone said, if you understood these things, she said, you would be humble before a very  clam.

You know why? Because the clams are doing a better job of being the clams, God meant them to be, than  you are, being the man or the woman God meant you to be. You fall far shorter from what we're supposed to be. You fall short. Are you the man God wants you to be?

But no, clams are much closer. They're glorifying God far more than you are. They, in a sense, know the creation knows there's something wrong, and it's long for the  resurrection in a way the human race is not. But when did you see the last line there, the last part? The creation will be liberated from its bondage decay, decay how?

It'll be brought into our freedom, and what that means is. And the Holy Spirit descends upon us to give us the redemption, the final redemption,  the final glorification of ourselves and our bodies. It's going to be an explosion of such love and power and glory that will bring all of  nature with it. Nature will come into what it should be on our co-tales. Isn't this something?

And let me just do a little reasoning with you for a second. He's saying, God says, for example, in Exodus 19 to his people, you are my treasured possession  though the whole earth is mine, Exodus 19. You are my treasured possession to the whole earth is mine. What he's saying is, as much as I love the earth, as much as I love the stars and the  moons, as much as I love the mountains and the trees and the animals, as much as I love  the earth, I love you the most. You are the most treasured possession, and you know what this means?

It's nature that actually comes in on our co-tales, what that means is this. It's astounding to me when you go out and look at the beauty of nature, when you look  at the beauty of the mountains and the beauty of the ocean to think that it's just a shadow  of what it's going to be. Current nature is just a shadow of its future, glorious self, right? And yet we are going to be more glorious than the future, renewed nature. And that's what the Holy Spirit will do.

Because the Holy Spirit's job is to get rid of the suffering, get rid of the bondage,  get rid of the brokenness, get rid of the groaning. That's what it's going to do in the future, so you say, ah, does that mean that's it? We just have to wait for that. We're groaning now, we're suffering now. Notice that?

We in really groan, nature is groaning. And the word groaning, by the way, that comes up three or four times in here is a word  that means to be in pain. People groan when they're dying, people groan when they're in labor, people groan when  they're in terrible, searing pain. Now we live in a time of groaning now, we groan, nature groans. So we say, okay, eventually all the groaning will be over, all the suffering will be over,  that's the job of the Spirit wonderful, but right now we're on our own, no.

Here we are in point two, by the way, those of you who care. The Holy Spirit's job is to deal with suffering and groaning. It's to deal with the brokenness of our lives. That's what we're being told, and eventually he's going to deal with it completely, but  he doesn't leave us on our own now, oh no. He's already in our lives to help us with the groaning.

We groan inwardly and we're in trouble. You know, remember the line from the great poet, it's, you know, things fall apart. The center cannot hold. Mayor Anarchy is loose upon the world. That's true.

Everything's falling apart. Your body's falling apart. Your relationships are falling apart. Your families are falling apart. Your communities are falling apart.

Everything's falling apart. Institutions, movements, they all fall apart. He said, what do you mean? They die. People move.

People fight. There's an entropy about everything in this world. We groan. Things are always falling apart, but the Holy Spirit has come into our lives as the first  fruits of that future glory. See, verse 23, not only so, but we ourselves who have the first fruits of the Spirit.

That word first fruit is so crucial. What that first fruit means, the first day's gathering from the harvest, even though they're  going to spend two more weeks and they're going to bring in all the wheat or they're  going to bring in all the corn. But the first day, you gather the corn or the wheat that's coming, you gather some now  and you eat it. It's a foretaste of the future feast. It's a down payment on the future fortune.

It's a real piece of the future. And what we're told is, with the Holy Spirit, this wonderful person and power who in the  future is going to deal with our groanings and suffering completely is in our lives now. We get a foretaste of that glory that enables us to handle the groanings and suffering  of life now. That's what this text is telling us. And in two ways, I'll use the image of sailing and rowing.

You know, sailing, you move through because the wind is to your back. In rowing, you've got no wind or maybe the wind in your face, but with exertion, you  can still get home. So when you're in the midst of groaning and suffering, there's two ways that the Holy  Spirit helps you, but He does. The first one is at the top versus 15, 16, 17. It says, the Spirit bears witness with our spirits that we're children of God.

It shores us that we're His children. In fact, it says, the Spirit testifies with our spirit that we, by Him, by the Spirit,  we cry Abba. The word Abba is the Aramaic term for daddy or papa. And what that means is, the Spirit gives us such confidence that God loves us, that we're  able to rely on Him and reach out to Him the way a little child reaches out to the Father. And see, that's what I mean by sailing.

Sometimes, in spite of all the troubles around us, God gives us this joy, this sense of His  reality, by the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Sonship, crying Abba, assurance that we're His,  but not always. Sometimes the Holy Spirit helps us in more difficult times than that. Sometimes the only way to get home is not through sailing because nothing's working. Somebody of the things that the Holy Spirit does, He changes you through the fruit of the  Spirit. He illuminates you by helping you understand God.

He empowers you to use your gifts, but sometimes nothing's going right at all. You're not seeing anybody change your life. God doesn't seem real to you, prayer is dry. You're not getting any prayers answered. And yet the Spirit doesn't abandon you.

Look at verse 26 and 27, in the same way, there's just 26, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with  groans that words cannot express. Sometimes we don't even know what to pray for. See, that's where we're in the depths. We don't even know what to pray for.

We're so overwhelmed with our troubles. We're groaning, you might say, so deeply and so loudly. And yet the Spirit is with us in those times, and I think over the years as I've thought  about that, I, in other words, sometimes the Spirit doesn't give us the joy that knows  no bounds. Sometimes the Spirit just gives us the peace that passes understanding so we can keep  rowing, so we can just keep doing the next thing, so we can just know God's with us even  now we don't feel them. You know how many of those Psalms, there's 150 Psalms, but I tell you, an awful lot of,  like half of them, or the Psalmist starts off by wrestling unhappy, angry, what's going  on?

I don't understand. Things are terrible. Oh, Lord, why are you letting all this happen? But the very end, he says, he wrestles through the end and says, but I know I believe I will  see the goodness of the Lord and the land of the living. And I think what he's, what happens is he just knows in his soul in spite of the fact  that everything else seems to be saying there is no God or God doesn't care or who cares  about God in his soul, he says, no, no, no, no, no, I know, I know, I know he's there,  I know he's not going to leave me like this, I'm going to do the next thing, I'm going  to pray, I'm going to read my Bible even though I'm not getting anything out of it.

You're rowing, and it's because of the Spirit's there helping you. The Spirit cares about your groaning and your suffering, that's his job. Some day to end it all, but even now to help you. Now let's not, we're not done, and here's the reason why. If you're a New Yorker is your practical, and New Yorkers say, this is all very inspiring,  but how do I really, how do I actually do this?

How do I do this? You talk about this wonderful future and this wonderful future, but it's supposed to  be somehow helping me now. I don't see how. How can I know? Well, here's the way.

The thing that activates the future so that it affects you now is assured hope. Verse 24, 25, in this hope we are saved, but if we hope for what we do not yet have, we  wait for it patiently. There's your, that's what you need, patience, poise, stick tillidiveness, how? It's through hope. Do you know how important hope is?

Hope is an assured future. Imagine two women, and both of them have a purse, and in that purse is all the assets and  money they have in the world. Everything they have in the world is in that purse, $1,000 in cash, that's it, they both  have $1,000 in cash, that's all they have. The difference is that woman knows that tomorrow, for some reasons, a $10 million will  be wired into her bank account. And the other woman knows that there's nothing coming from anybody for the indefinite future.

And imagine those two women go out in New York City and they both have the very same experience  somebody snatches their purse, their purses are lost, they're taken, they're stolen. How are they going to respond to that? I can tell you this, the woman who knows that tomorrow, $10 million is coming to her  bank account, says, what an inconvenience, oh well. And the other woman is in total despair. Do you know why?

Same circumstances, why is the response so different? Because what you know about the future completely determines how you process the present. What you know about the future, your understanding of your own future completely determines how  you process the present. How can you know that the redemption of your body is coming? How can you know that that's your future?

If you knew it, if you were sure of it, you could face anything because a whole lot better  than $10 million is coming into your bank account. How can you be sure? Here's how you can be sure. Many people, commentators have been wondering, so over the years, how could the Spirit  groan? You notice in verse 26, it says that when the Spirit is with us and all of our trouble,  it says, the Spirit intercedes for us with groans, which means the Spirit is suffering.

And many commentators are saying, how could the divine and mortal Spirit of God suffer? Jesus, in Mark chapter 7, takes a little deaf mute, a man who's been really suffered  his whole life aside. He wants to heal him. And as he's about to heal him, he looks to heaven, and he groans, the same word. That means he's in pain.

Why? Why doesn't he just say, ha ha, way to you see what I'm going to do? Why? Why is he groaning in pain? Well, the first answer is, because here's a man who's so loving and so vulnerable in  his love, that he can emotionally identify with a suffering man that he's just met.

And he feels the man's suffering himself. But the ultimate reason is he knows that in order to deliver him and us from his groaning  and suffering, Jesus is himself going to have to be plunged into suffering and groaning  to deficit. No one else has ever been, you know, sent. Because when Jesus on the cross says, my God, my God, why has the offer shaken me? He's quoting Psalm 22, right?

But Psalm 22, verse 1, which would have been in Jesus head as he's dying, here's the  full verse. My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me? So far from the words of my groaning, Jesus groaned in pain and got abandoned him. I'm groaning and got abandoned him.

Why? Because he got the abandonment that our sins deserve so that you can know, know, that whenever  you groan, God will not abandon you, that he's with you. So you can't face the groaning and suffering of this life without certainty about your  future. And you can't be certain about your future unless you know that because Jesus Christ  died for you and went through that for you, that even though you fail and even though  you don't live the life you ought to live and even though your faith is imperfect and  even though your repentance needs to be repented of, God is there with you, the Holy Spirit  is there with you. He will not abandon you.

The implications of this are astounding, are they not? If God loves the world, this material world like this, should we care for creation and  environment? Yes. If God only, of all the religions of the world, only the Bible says that this world is permanent  and this material world is a permanent and that's a terrific incentive to fight against  disease and hunger, is it not? And if you're facing death, what better?

You can laugh in the face of death with this. And if any of you are chronically sick or even just getting old and almost come to the place  where you feel like my body is my enemy, it's not. I want you to hear that. It's not. It's sin and evil in your body that's the enemy but you're sin and evil's in your soul  and it's in the world and we are without hope unless he gives us the victory, oh God,  he must give us the victory and he will.

Let us pray. Our Father, help us take the theology of this passage. It should make us zealous for caring for material needs. It should make us powerful in the face of our own sickness and even impending death. It should fill us with such hope that we are able to face the worst groaning and suffering  because we know that someday your spirit will end it all.

Father, we like the rest of creation long for the final redemption of our bodies and  until then, holy spirit, help us, help us to have the joy and the peace of past understanding  and the midst of what we have to face. Thank you for all these assurances. Make us people with zeal and joy but who also know how to weep with those who weep because  we know these great truths, we pray this in Jesus' name, Amen.

欢迎来到福音与生活！圣灵是谁？为什么圣灵的工作对基督徒的生活如此重要？圣经告诉我们，圣灵不仅仅是一个模糊的力量，而是一个在基督徒生活中以深刻方式工作的位格。今天，Tim Keller探讨圣灵如何呼召我们信仰，将我们联合在一起，用恩赐装备我们，并塑造我们更像基督。

今晚的经文来自罗马书第八章，第15到27节。

> 因为你们所受的不是奴仆的灵，仍旧害怕；所受的乃是儿子的灵，因此我们呼叫：阿爸，父！圣灵与我们的心同证我们是神的儿女。既是儿女，便是后嗣，就是神的后嗣，和基督同作后嗣。如果我们和他一同受苦，也必和他一同得荣耀。我想，现在的苦楚若比起将来要显于我们的荣耀，就不足介意了。
>
> 受造之物切望等候神的众子显出来。因为受造之物服在虚空之下，不是自己愿意，乃是因那叫他如此的。但受造之物仍然指望脱离败坏的辖制，得享神儿女自由的荣耀。我们知道一切受造之物一同叹息、劳苦，直到如今。不但如此，就是我们这有圣灵初结果子的，也是自己心里叹息，等候得着儿子的名分，乃是我们的身体得赎。
>
> 我们得救是在乎盼望；只是所见的盼望不是盼望，谁还盼望他所见的呢？但我们若盼望那所不见的，就必忍耐等候。况且，我们的软弱有圣灵帮助；我们本不晓得当怎样祷告，只是圣灵亲自用说不出来的叹息替我们祷告。
>
> 鉴察人心的，晓得圣灵的意思，因为圣灵照着神的旨意替圣徒祈求。

这是主的话语。

我们一直在做关于圣灵的系列讲道，今晚我们来到这个系列的结尾。我们已经看了圣灵在我们里面和为我们所做的一些相当著名的事情。他呼召我们并使我们能够相信。他重生我们，在我们里面创造基督般的品格。他使我们在教会里彼此联合。他用恩赐赋予我们能力，使我们能够以改变生命的方式服务周围的人。这些都是相当著名的，但今晚我们要看一段经文，告诉我们圣灵为我们所做的终极事情、最后的事情。这可能是最令人惊叹的，却不那么为人所知。

让我们从经文中注意到，我们在这里学到的是圣灵将来要为我们做什么，因此圣灵现在能为我们做什么，以及我们如何让圣灵在我们生命中做这些事。他将来要为我们做什么，因此他现在能为我们做什么，以及我们如何让圣灵在我们生命中做这些事。我们在说什么呢？

首先，圣灵将来要做什么。简而言之，罗马书第八章是一个惊人的章节，在第八章第30节往下一点，我们读到："他所召的人，又称他们为义；所称为义的人，又叫他们得荣耀。"他不只是停在称义，他称义的同时也叫人得荣耀。我们将要得荣耀。

读保罗书信最令人困惑的事情之一是，他不断在救恩的时态上变换。所以有时他说，你们已经得救了，我们已经得救了，我们已经被赎回了，我们被赎回了，过去式；然后突然他转过来说，有时甚至在同一句话里，但我们将要被赎回，我们将要得救。那么到底是哪个？

事实上，他在这里就这样做了，你看到了吗？因为在14、15、16节，他说，作为基督的信徒，我们是他的儿女。我们已经被收养了。我们已经领受了儿子的灵。我们已经被收养了。我们是他的儿女。但是，看第23节，它说，我们等候得着儿子的名分。他又这样做了。这个人怎么了？答案是这个概念的丰富性。

你看，赎回这个词，特别是这里使用的这个词，意思是被购买、从捆绑中赎出、从奴役中买出来、从捆绑或奴役中赎出来。捆绑的意思是字面上被锁链束缚，不能自由地成为你应该成为的人，不能自由地做你应该做的事。

我们从圣经全书知道，甚至从创世记第三章的开头就知道，当我们犯罪失去与神的关系时，我们也失去了所有其他的关系。当我们失去与神的关系时，其他一切都破碎了。没有什么是神原本设计的样子，因此，我们在生活的每个领域都处于捆绑中，我们不能自由地成为神要我们成为的一切。换句话说，我们在心理上、社会上、关系上和身体上都处于捆绑中。

我是什么意思？即使是最好的基督徒，即使是最成熟的基督徒，仍然经历大量对恐惧、焦虑、心硬的捆绑。他们当然经历某种程度的自由，但他们仍然经历这些。即使是最好的教会仍然经历大量的冲突、自我、争斗和偏见。即使是最好的人仍然会生病、变老和死亡。这些都不是神原本设计的样子。所有这些苦难，所有这些破碎都不是神要我们成为的。

因此，你成为基督徒的那一刻，你所有的罪都被赦免了。如今，那些在基督耶稣里的就不定罪了。神在基督里看你，这意味着他对待你就好像你做了基督所做的一切。你在他眼中完全被称为义，从你相信的第一刻起就被爱，就像你在十亿年后一样被爱。在这个意义上，在这个深刻的意义上，你得救了，过去式。

然而，虽然你已经被赎回，在那个意义上，你仍然需要救赎。仍然有捆绑。我们已经被赎回，但我们需要被赎回，而且我们将会被赎回。因为我们在第17节被告知，虽然我们在苦难中，虽然我们在捆绑中，我们将要得荣耀，这意味着罪的所有影响、所有的捆绑都将结束，特别是第23节，我们的身体将被赎回。我们切切等候得着儿子的名分，乃是我们的身体得赎。

希腊人，古希腊哲学家相信身体是坏的，终极的救恩是灵魂从身体中解脱出来。身体是坏的，身体是破碎的，身体是软弱的，终极的救恩是从身体中解脱出来。我必须告诉你，我越老越同情这个想法，你越看我就越明白。因为如果你有慢性病，或者你只是变老了，你只是越来越感觉到身体的软弱，你会开始说，这不是……身体是我的敌人。它是一个监狱。救恩是从它那里解脱出来，但这不是圣经的看法。你看到这里说的是什么吗？

你最终的救赎甚至不是去天堂。你最终的救赎是在末日，当你复活，拥有一个新的荣耀的身体时。那是最终的喜乐，最终的祝福。那是神要你拥有的丰盛。那是神要你作为人类所知道的喜乐和兴盛的丰盛。这是圣灵的工作。是圣灵在做这事。罗马书八章11节，在我们开始读的地方往上一点，说："然而，叫耶稣从死里复活者的灵若住在你们心里，那叫基督从死里复活的，也必借着住在你们心里的圣灵，使你们必死的身体又活过来。"

当你第一次相信时进入你里面的圣灵，有一天要改变你的身体。腓立比书三章21节说，这卑贱的身体将要改变形状，和基督荣耀的身体相似。你说，那会是什么样子？

我们实际上知道一点点。我们不仅有耶稣基督和他复活后的样子，他是从死里首先复活的，这意味着他是我们对拥有一个荣耀复活身体意味着什么有些概念的唯一一个人，脱离了不完美，脱离了所有对朽坏的捆绑，脱离了任何错误。我们还有哥林多前书十五章，保罗在那里说了一些伟大的事情。这必朽坏的要穿上不朽坏的。所种的是羞辱的，复活的是荣耀的。所种的是软弱的，复活的是强壮的。所种的是血气的身体，复活的是灵性的身体，就在那里。看到那说的是什么吗？

这是你复活荣耀的未来。你想知道它是什么样子吗？你想知道它会是什么样吗？你可能想太多这个，因为你会陷入猜测我们能做这个或那个。但我们的问题是我们实际上想得太少了。关于你将来复活的身体，我们知道三件事。它将是我们的身体，它将是一个美丽的身体，它将是一个有能力的身体。它将是我们的身体，记住保罗说的。

这必朽坏的要穿上不朽坏的。当耶稣从死里复活，向门徒显现时，他仍然有钉痕，记得吗？这怎么可能？因为那是他的身体，他必朽坏的身体穿上了不朽坏的。他仍然是他自己，这就是为什么当人们在复活后看到耶稣时，起初他们认不出他，然后他们认出来了。

你知道对那些二十多岁的人来说最烦人的事情之一是什么吗？你不断遇到四五十岁的老人，他们认识你小时候，但自从你长大后就没见过你了。有点不舒服，因为你走向他们说，嗨，你认识我吗？不认识。好吧，我是某某，然后他们看着你，他们从你八岁起就没见过你，现在你二十五岁左右了。他们说，你是小吉米或小莎莉，真的很糟糕，真的很糟糕。但重点是那仍然是你，是你八岁的自己通过成长过程改变了。他们能看到，你的身体，你的脸，你的眼睛，哦是的，你看看你！

这就是将来会是什么样子。我们将是我们自己，我们真的将是我们。我的意思是那是惊人的，世界上没有其他宗教有那种自我。我们将是我们自己，将是我们的身体穿上不朽坏的。你知道在这个世界上我们有这个想法，但在那个世界里，当我们见到彼此时，我们会说，就是你，我一直知道你可以是这样的。我看到了一些端倪，但现在看看你，那将是你，将是我们。所以那将是我们的身体。

第二，那将是一个美丽的身体，保罗说所种的是羞辱的，复活的是荣耀的。在这个世界上有些人有丑陋的灵魂却有美丽的身体，有些人有美丽的灵魂却有丑陋的身体，但那时不会。C.S.路易斯说："如果我们让他，他会使我们中最软弱最污秽的人成为一个耀眼、光芒四射的不朽之物，浑身洋溢着我们现在无法想象的能量、喜乐、智慧和爱。他能使我们成为明亮、无瑕的镜子，完美地（当然规模较小）反射出他自己无限的能力、喜悦和良善。这就是等待我们的，不会更少，一面反射的镜子，但还有另一种方式来表达。"

他的朋友，路易斯的朋友托尔金在某处，在他的一部虚构作品中，有一个角色死了，当他死后躺在那里，关于这个人是这样描述的。托尔金和路易斯都是基督徒，努力理解将来的荣耀是什么样子，我们被告知这个人死了，他躺在那里，这就是他描述他的方式："他身上显出极大的美，所有来到那里的人都惊奇地看着他，因为他们看到他年轻时的优雅、壮年时的英勇、老年时的智慧和威严都融合在一起，他长久躺在那里，是世界破碎之前人类君王荣耀不褪的形象。"

所以托尔金试图传达的是，例如，看，孩子有一种美，他们会失去，但年轻男女在他们的全盛时期，身体巅峰时期有另一种美，是孩子没有的，老人也没有的，但老人有一种威严、智慧和高贵，是年轻人没有的，但所有这些美和荣耀当然只是分散的，但那时它们都将合一。它们都将合一。

保罗说我们会不同，我们会是我们自己，但他说星与星的荣光也有分别。每颗星都不同，它们都是，每一颗都不同。它们都会不同，但我们将是星星。不仅是我们的身体，不仅是美丽的身体，而且它们将是有能力的。保罗说所种的是软弱的身体，但复活的是强壮的，然后他进一步说所种的是血气的身体，复活的是灵性的身体。

那是什么？事实上想想，那不是一个范畴错误吗？复活的是灵性的身体，那没有意义。看在我们的范畴里，你要么是灵，要么是身体，你要么是灵，要么是身体。好吧，拜托，保罗，我们会是灵还是身体？保罗说是的。

事实上耶稣穿过门，他穿过锁着的门，他们说哦是个鬼，记得吗，路加福音二十四章，复活的基督穿过锁着的门，他们说哦是个鬼，他说给我一条鱼，他吃了鱼，他说灵没有骨没有肉，摸摸我，看看我，一个灵性的身体，奔跑却不困倦，行走却不疲乏，现在你有五种感官，如果有一千种感官我们会有呢？谁知道？让我们现在把帷幕拉上，因为我不知道我们是否能够，我们在细节方面知道得更多。

但你有没有想过你将来复活的、完美的身体在荣耀细胞中？我确信想太多是可能的，但我不认为这是我们大多数人的问题。你为什么如此愤怒，因为你没有减掉体重，看起来你永远不会像你想要的那样好看、健康或荣耀，是因为你没有在想。我们需要做身体的好管家，尽你所能做最好的管家，但不要把你的希望放在那里。你想要的能力，你想要的荣耀，你知道，有一个你在里面，直到这一刻才会出来，直到圣灵使你必死的身体活过来，我们等候得着儿子的名分，乃是我们的身体得赎。

但这还不是全部，这还不是全部。当圣灵做他的工作时，我们将要生活的世界是一个更新的自然世界。第19节，只是一分钟，只是指出与我们身体的复活一起，19、20、21节是绝对惊人的。

明天是"捐赠星期二"，我们想让你知道今年我们有一个特别的机会。你可能知道，福音与生活支持救赎者城市到城市，这是一个致力于通过植堂在世界各地城市发展福音运动的事工。城市到城市是Tim Keller共同创立的，他深深关心这个使命。在即将到来的2026年肯尼亚培训活动中，城市到城市将帮助培训、指导和支持两组20位牧师在非洲各地植堂。在这个捐赠星期二，我们的目标是筹集15万美元，帮助赞助参加肯尼亚内罗毕培训密集课程的植堂者，以便城市到城市可以帮助和支持这些植堂者在非洲各地开始教会。这项工作对福音在非洲城市的传播至关重要，从坎帕拉到拉各斯到约翰内斯堡。所以，当你考虑如何在捐赠星期二捐款时，请考虑向福音与生活捐款。我们在捐赠星期二收到的每一美元都将直接用于城市到城市在2026年帮助在非洲开始新教会的工作。要在明天捐款，请访问gospelonlife.com/Tuesday。再次，是gospelonlife.com/Tuesday。感谢你对这个事工的慷慨和忠实支持。

现在，这是Keller博士今天信息的其余部分。19到21节，它说什么？它说受造之物，顺便说一句，就是自然界。那是山和动物，你知道，还有树。它说受造之物切望等候神的众子显出来。因为受造之物服在虚空之下，不是自己愿意，乃是因那叫他如此的。但受造之物仍然指望脱离败坏的辖制，得享神儿女自由的荣耀。什么？什么？

它说了三件事。实际上，我们对这三件事知道得不多，但我们确实知道这三件事。它说自然，自然界，不是它应该是的样子，因为我们。不知何故，我们的罪带来了自然的堕落，所以即使自然也不是它应该是的样子。它被挫败了。它不是神要它成为的一切。它服在败坏的辖制之下。这是第一件事。

第二，它知道。它知道它不是它应该是的样子，它渴望被解放。保罗说的什么意思？树和动物怎么可能？他在说什么？当然，一方面，我希望你知道，他不是在做童话故事。他不是在说，嗯，你知道，树和动物可以说话，但当你在周围时它们不说。他不是在说那个，但我告诉你他在说什么。他在说受造之物有它自己的生命。它也是神造的，为要荣耀他，就像你一样。诗篇十九篇说诸天，这个自然界荣耀神，作为这样，它们是受造之物，树和动物，它们有自己的生命，它们应该得到极大的尊重。

但这是原因之一。不知何故，受造之物以它自己的方式比你我更认识它的造物主。多年前，那就是它在说的。多年前，记得，伊丽莎白·艾略特曾是我在戈登康威尔神学院的老师。有人说，如果你理解这些事，她说，你会在一只蛤蜊面前谦卑。你知道为什么吗？因为蛤蜊在做神要它们做的蛤蜊方面做得比你做神要你做的男人或女人好。你离你应该成为的差得远。你是神要你成为的人吗？不是，蛤蜊更接近。它们比你更荣耀神。它们，在某种意义上，知道受造之物知道有什么不对劲，它渴望复活，而人类却没有。

但你看到最后那行了吗，最后那部分？受造之物将脱离败坏的辖制，怎么脱离？它将进入我们的自由，那意味着什么。当圣灵降临在我们身上，给我们最终的救赎，我们自己和我们身体的最终荣耀，那将是一个爱、能力和荣耀的爆发，将带着所有的自然一起。自然将凭着我们的衣角进入它应该成为的样子。这不是很了不起吗？

让我和你做一点推理。他在说，神在出埃及记十九章对他的百姓说，你是我的宝贝，虽然全地都是我的，出埃及记十九章。你是我的宝贝，虽然全地都是我的。他在说的是，尽管我爱地球，尽管我爱星星和月亮，尽管我爱山、树和动物，尽管我爱地球，我最爱你。你是最宝贵的财产，你知道这意味着什么吗？实际上是自然凭着我们的衣角进来，那意味着这个。

当你出去看自然的美丽，当你看山的美丽和海洋的美丽，想到这只是它将要成为的影子，对我来说是惊人的。现在的自然只是它将来荣耀自我的影子，对吗？然而我们将比将来更新的自然更荣耀。这就是圣灵要做的。

因为圣灵的工作是除去苦难，除去捆绑，除去破碎，除去叹息。这就是它将来要做的，所以你说，啊，这意味着就是这样？我们只需要等待那个。我们现在在叹息，现在在受苦。注意到了吗？我们里面叹息，自然在叹息。叹息这个词在这里出现了三四次，是一个意味着痛苦的词。人们在死的时候叹息，人们在生产的时候叹息，人们在可怕的、灼热的痛苦中叹息。

现在我们生活在叹息的时代，我们叹息，自然叹息。所以我们说，好吧，最终所有的叹息都会结束，所有的苦难都会结束，这是圣灵的工作，太好了，但现在我们只能靠自己，不是的。这是第二点，顺便说一句，对那些关心的人来说。圣灵的工作是处理苦难和叹息。是处理我们生活的破碎。这就是我们被告知的，最终他会完全处理它，但他不会让我们现在独自面对，哦不。他已经在我们生命中帮助我们的叹息。

我们里面叹息，我们有麻烦。你知道，记得那位伟大诗人的那句话，你知道，万物崩溃。中心无法维持。纯粹的混乱在世界上肆虐。这是真的。一切都在崩溃。你的身体在崩溃。你的关系在崩溃。你的家庭在崩溃。你的社区在崩溃。一切都在崩溃。机构，运动，它们都崩溃。他说，你什么意思？它们死了。人们搬走。人们争吵。这个世界上的一切都有一种熵。我们叹息。事情总是在崩溃，但圣灵已经进入我们的生命，作为将来荣耀的初熟果子。

看，第23节，不但如此，就是我们这有圣灵初结果子的。初熟果子这个词非常关键。初熟果子意味着什么，从收获的第一天采集的，即使他们还要再花两周把所有的麦子或所有的玉米收进来。但第一天，你采集正在来的玉米或麦子，你现在采集一些并吃它。这是将来盛宴的预尝。这是将来财富的首付款。这是将来的真实一部分。

我们被告知的是，有了圣灵，这个奇妙的位格和能力，将来会完全处理我们的叹息和苦难，现在就在我们生命中。我们得到那荣耀的预尝，使我们能够处理现在生活的叹息和苦难。这就是这段经文告诉我们的。以两种方式，我将使用航行和划船的形象。你知道，航行，你移动是因为风在你背后。划船，你没有风或者风可能在你脸上，但通过努力，你仍然可以回家。

所以当你在叹息和苦难中时，圣灵以两种方式帮助你，但他确实帮助。第一种是在顶部的15、16、17节。它说，圣灵与我们的心同证我们是神的儿女。它确保我们是他的孩子。事实上，它说，圣灵与我们的心同证我们，借着圣灵，我们呼叫阿爸。阿爸这个词是亚兰语，意思是爸爸或父亲。那意味着什么是，圣灵给我们如此的信心，知道神爱我们，我们能够依靠他，向他伸出手，就像小孩子向父亲伸出手一样。

你看，那就是我说的航行的意思。有时，尽管我们周围有各种麻烦，神给我们这种喜乐，这种对他实在的感觉，借着圣灵，儿子的灵，呼叫阿爸，确保我们是他的，但不总是这样。有时圣灵在比那更困难的时候帮助我们。有时回家的唯一方法不是通过航行，因为什么都不起作用。圣灵做的一些事情，他通过圣灵的果子改变你。他通过帮助你理解神来光照你。他赋予你能力使用你的恩赐，但有时一切都不顺利。你看不到任何人改变你的生活。神对你来说不真实，祷告是枯燥的。你没有得到任何祷告的回应。然而圣灵没有抛弃你。

看第26、27节，同样，只是26节，圣灵帮助我们的软弱。我们本不晓得当怎样祷告，只是圣灵亲自用说不出来的叹息替我们祷告。有时我们甚至不知道该为什么祷告。看，那是我们在深渊里。我们甚至不知道该为什么祷告。我们被麻烦淹没了。你可以说我们叹息得如此深，如此大声。然而圣灵在那些时候与我们同在，我认为多年来当我思考这个，我，换句话说，有时圣灵没有给我们那无边的喜乐。有时圣灵只是给我们那超越理解的平安，所以我们可以继续划船，所以我们只是继续做下一件事，所以我们只是知道神与我们同在，即使现在我们感觉不到他。

你知道有多少诗篇，有150篇诗篇，但我告诉你，大约一半的诗篇，诗人开始时是在挣扎，不高兴，愤怒，发生什么事了？我不明白。事情太糟糕了。哦，主啊，你为什么让这一切发生？但在最后，他挣扎到最后说，但我知道，我相信我会在活人之地看到主的恩惠。我认为发生的是他只是在灵魂深处知道，尽管其他一切似乎都在说没有神，或神不在乎，或谁在乎神，在他灵魂深处，他说，不，不，不，不，不，我知道，我知道，我知道他在那里，我知道他不会让我这样，我要做下一件事，我要祷告，我要读圣经，即使我什么都没得到。

你在划船，这是因为圣灵在那里帮助你。圣灵关心你的叹息和苦难，这是他的工作。有一天要结束这一切，但即使现在也帮助你。

现在我们还没完，这就是原因。如果你是纽约人，你很实际，纽约人说，这一切都很鼓舞人心，但我到底怎么做呢？我怎么真正做这个？你谈论这个美好的将来和这个美好的将来，但它应该以某种方式现在帮助我。我不知道怎么做。我怎么能知道？

好吧，这就是方法。激活将来使它现在影响你的是确定的盼望。24、25节，我们得救是在乎盼望，但我们若盼望那所不见的，就必忍耐等候。这就是你需要的，忍耐，沉着，坚持不懈，怎么做？通过盼望。你知道盼望有多重要吗？盼望是一个确定的将来。

想象两个女人，她们都有一个钱包，钱包里是她们在世界上拥有的所有资产和钱。她们在世界上拥有的一切都在那个钱包里，一千美元现金，就这些，她们都有一千美元现金，就这些。不同的是那个女人知道明天，由于某些原因，一千万美元将转入她的银行账户。另一个女人知道在可预见的将来没有任何东西从任何人那里来。想象这两个女人在纽约市出去，她们都有完全相同的经历，有人抢走了她们的钱包，她们的钱包丢了，被拿走了，被偷了。她们会怎么反应？

我可以告诉你这个，那个知道明天一千万美元要进入她银行账户的女人会说，多么不方便，哦好吧。另一个女人会完全绝望。你知道为什么吗？相同的环境，为什么反应如此不同？因为你对将来的了解完全决定了你如何处理现在。你对将来的了解，你对自己将来的理解完全决定了你如何处理现在。

你怎么能知道你身体的救赎要来？你怎么能知道那是你的将来？如果你知道，如果你确定，你可以面对任何事情，因为比一千万美元好得多的东西要进入你的银行账户。你怎么能确定？这是你怎么能确定的。许多人，评论家多年来一直在想，圣灵怎么能叹息？你注意到在第26节，它说当圣灵与我们在一起在我们所有的麻烦中时，它说，圣灵用叹息替我们祷告，这意味着圣灵在受苦。

许多评论家说，神圣的、不朽的神的灵怎么能受苦？耶稣在马可福音第七章，带着一个小聋哑人，一个一生都真正受苦的人到一边。他想医治他。当他即将医治他时，他仰望天，叹息，同一个词。那意味着他在痛苦中。为什么？为什么他不只是说，哈哈，等你看我要做什么？为什么？为什么他在痛苦中叹息？

第一个答案是，因为这是一个如此有爱心、在爱中如此脆弱的人，他能够情感上认同一个他刚认识的受苦的人。他感受到那人的苦难。但终极的原因是他知道，为了把他和我们从他的叹息和苦难中拯救出来，耶稣自己将要被投入比其他任何人都更深的苦难和叹息中，你知道吗，送来的。

因为当耶稣在十字架上说，我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？他是在引用诗篇二十二篇，对吗？但诗篇二十二篇第一节，会在耶稣临死时在他脑海中，这是完整的经文。我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？为什么你远离拯救我？远离我叹息的话语，耶稣在痛苦中叹息，神离弃了他。我在叹息，神离弃了他。为什么？因为他得到了我们的罪应得的离弃，这样你可以知道，知道，无论何时你叹息，神都不会离弃你，他与你同在。

所以你不能面对这生的叹息和苦难，如果没有对你将来的确定。你不能确定你的将来，除非你知道，因为耶稣基督为你死，为你经历了那些，即使你失败了，即使你没有过你应该过的生活，即使你的信心不完美，即使你的悔改需要被悔改，神与你同在，圣灵与你同在。他不会离弃你。

这的意义是惊人的，不是吗？如果神像这样爱世界，这个物质世界，我们应该关心创造和环境吗？是的。如果神只有，在世界所有的宗教中，只有圣经说这个世界是永久的，这个物质世界是永久的，那是与疾病和饥饿斗争的巨大激励，不是吗？如果你正面对死亡，还有什么更好的？你可以笑对死亡。如果你们中有人慢性病或甚至只是变老，几乎到了你觉得我的身体是我的敌人的地步，它不是。我要你听到那个。它不是。是你身体里的罪和邪恶是敌人，但你的罪和邪恶在你的灵魂里，在世界里，除非他给我们胜利，我们就没有希望，哦神，他必须给我们胜利，他会的。

让我们祷告。我们的父，帮助我们理解这段经文的神学。它应该使我们热心关心物质需求。它应该使我们在面对自己的疾病甚至即将到来的死亡时充满力量。它应该充满我们如此的盼望，使我们能够面对最严重的叹息和苦难，因为我们知道有一天你的灵会结束这一切。父啊，我们像其他受造物一样，渴望我们身体的最终救赎，直到那时，圣灵，帮助我们，帮助我们拥有超越理解的喜乐与平安，在我们必须面对的事情中。感谢你给予我们的所有保证。使我们成为充满热情和喜乐的人，但也知道如何与那些哭泣的人同哭，因为我们知道这些伟大的真理，我们奉耶稣的名祷告，阿门。
