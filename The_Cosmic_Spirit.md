Welcome to Gospel and Life! Who is the Holy Spirit? And why is the Spirit's work so vital to the Christian life? The Bible tells us the Holy Spirit is not just a vague force, but a person who works in  the lives of Christians in profound ways. Today Tim Keller is exploring how the Spirit calls us to faith, unites us together, equips  us with gifts and shapes us to be more like Christ.

Tonight's scripture is from the Book of Romans, chapter 8, verses 15 through 27. For you did not receive a Spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received  the Spirit of sonship, and by him we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirits that we are God's children. Now if we are children, then we are heirs, heirs of God and coheirs with Christ, if indeed  we share in his sufferings an order that we may also share in his glory. I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will  be revealed in us.

The creation waits an eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of  the one who subjected it. And hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into  the glorious freedom of the children of God. We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right  up to the present time. Not only so, but we ourselves who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as  we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.

We are in this hope we were saved, but hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he already has? But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently. In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with  groans that words cannot express.

And He who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit because the Spirit intercedes  for the saints and accordance with God's will. This is the Word of the Lord. We've been doing a series on the Holy Spirit and tonight we come to the end of the series. And we've looked at a number of pretty well known things that the Holy Spirit does in  us and for us. He calls us and enables us to believe.

He regenerates us and creates Christ-like character in us. He unites us one to another inside the church. He empowers us with his gifts so that we can serve people around us in life-changing  ways. Those are all pretty well known, but tonight we look at a passage that tells us about  the ultimate thing, the final thing, if the Holy Spirit does for us. And it's maybe the most astonishing of all, and not nearly as well known.

Let's notice from the text what we learn here is what the Spirit will do for us in the  future, what the Spirit therefore can do for us in the present, and how we can let the  Spirit do that in our lives. What He will do for us in the future, what He therefore can do for us now in the present,  and how we can let the Spirit do that in our lives. What are we talking about? Well, first, what the Spirit will do in the future. And in a nutshell, chapter 8 of Romans is an amazing chapter, and a little further  down on chapter 8 and verse 30, we read where it says, he, the Lord, those he called, he  also justified, but those he justified, he also glorified.

He doesn't just stop at justification, he justified as he also glorifies. We are going to be glorified. One of the most confusing things about the reading Paul is he constantly changes the  tenses on salvation on us. So sometimes he says, you have been saved, we have been saved, we have been redeemed,  we are redeemed, past tense, then suddenly all of a sudden he turns around and says,  it's sometimes in the same sentence, but we will be redeemed, we will be saved. So which is it?

In fact, he does it here, did you see it? Because in verses 14, 15, and 16, he says, as believers in Christ, we are his children. We have been adopted. We have received the Spirit of Sonship. We have been adopted.

We are his children. And yet, look at verse 23, it says, we wait eagerly for our adoption. There he did it again. What's the matter with this man? And the answer is the richness of the concept.

See, the word redemption, especially that is the word that's operative in here, means  to be purchased, ransomed out of bondage, to be bought out of slavery, to be ransomed  out of bondage or slavery. Now, the being bondage means to literally be in chains, not to be free, to be who you  are supposed to be, not to be free, to do the things you're supposed to do. And what we know from the Bible throughout, even at the very beginning in Genesis chapter 3,  is that when we sinned and lost our relationship with God, we lost all other relationships. When we lost our relationship with God, everything else broke. Nothing else is the way God designed it to be, and therefore, we are in bondage in every  area of our life, where we are not free to be all the things that God meant us to be.

In other words, we are in bondage psychologically and sociologically and relationally and physically. What do I mean? Even the best Christians, even the most mature Christians, still experience an enormous  amount of bondage to fear, anxiety, hardness of heart. They certainly experience a certain amount of freedom, but they still experience that. Even the best churches still experience a great deal of conflict and egos and fights and prejudice.

And even the very best people still get sick, get old, and die. And none of those things are the way God originally designed them to be. None of them, all that suffering, all that brokenness is not what God meant us to be. And therefore, the minute you become a Christian, all your sins are forgiven. There's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.

God sees you in Christ, which means He treats you as if you've done everything Christ has done. You are absolutely as justified in His sight, the first moment you believe and as loved  as you will be a billion years from now. And in all, in that sense, and in that's a profound sense, you are saved, past ends. And yet, though you have been redeemed, in that sense, you still need redemption. They're still bondage.

We have been redeemed, but we need to be redeemed, and we will be. Because we're told in verse 17, though we're in suffering, though we're in bondage,  we will be glorified, which means all the effects of sin, all the bonds will be over,  and in particular, it's verse 23, we will have our bodies redeemed. We await eagerly the redemption, the final adoption, the final salvation, the redemption  of our bodies. Now, the Greeks, the old Greek philosophers, believe the body was bad, and the ultimate  salvation was for the soul to be freed from the body. The body is bad, the body is broken, the body is weak, and the ultimate salvation is to  be freed from the body.

And I must tell you, the older I get, the more I sympathize with that idea, the more you  see me. Because if you're chronically ill or if you're just getting older and you're just, and you  just sense more and more the weakness of your body, you can start to say, this is, this  isn't, the body is my enemy. It's a prison house. Salvation would be to be free of it, but that's not how the Bible sees it. Do you see what this is saying?

Your final redemption is not even going to heaven. Your final redemption is at the end of time when you're resurrected and you have a new  and glorious body. That's the final joy, the final blessing. That's the fullness of what God wants you to have. That's the fullness of the joy and the flourishing that God wants you to know as a human being.

And this is the work of the Spirit. It's the Spirit doing this. Romans 8 verse 11. It's a little higher up than what we began where we began to read says this. And if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, He who raised  Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit.

Who lives in you? The Spirit that comes into you when you first believe some day is going to transform  your body. Philippians 3.21, then the body of our humiliation. This frail form will be conformed to the image of Christ's glory. You say, what will that be like?

Well, we actually know a little bit about it. Not only do we have Jesus Christ and what He was like after His resurrection, and He's  the first fruit from the dead, which means He's the one person that we have some idea about  what it means to have a glorious resurrected body, free from the imperfection, free from  all bondage to decay, free from anything wrong. But we also have 1 Corinthians 15 where Paul says some of these great things. This mortal body will put on immortality. It is sown in dishonor, it will be raised in splendor.

It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power, it is sown in natural body, it is raised  in spiritual body, right there. See what that's saying? Here's your resurrected glory future. Do you want to know what it looks like? Do you know what it's going to be like?

You probably can think too much about this because you can get into speculation what  we would be able to do this or that. But our problem is that we actually think too little about it. Here's three things we know about your future resurrected body. It'll be our body, it'll be a beautiful body, it'll be a powerful body. It'll be our body, remember what Paul said.

This mortal body will put on immortality. When Jesus rose from the dead and he appeared as he was disciples, he still had his nail  prints, remember that? How could that be? It's because it was his body, his mortal body putting on immortality. He was still him, that's the reason why when people looked at Jesus after his resurrection.

At first they didn't recognize Him and then they did. You know one of the most irritating things for those of you who are like maybe in your  20s, you're constantly running into older people in their 40s and 50s who knew you when  you were a kid but hadn't seen you since you grew up. It's a little icky because you come up to them and you say, hi, do you know me? No. Well, I'm so and so and then they look at you, they haven't seen you since your 8th,  now you're 25 or something like that.

And they go, you're little Jimmy or little Sally and it's really awful, it's really  awful. But the point is it is still you, it is your 8 year old self transformed by a process  of growth. They can see it, your body, your face, your eyes, oh yeah, how about look at you? That's what it's going to be like. We're going to be ourselves, we're really going to be us.

I mean that's an amazing, there is no other religion in the world that has that kind of  self. We're going to be us, it's going to be our body putting on immortality. You know in this world we have that idea but in that world it'll be like when we see  each other we're going to say, it is you, I always know you could be like this. I saw glimpses of it but now look at you, it'll be you, it'll be us. So it'll be our body, secondly it'll be a beautiful body, it's sewn in dishonor, Paul says  and it's raised in splendor.

In this world there are people with ugly souls that have beautiful bodies and there's people  with beautiful souls that have ugly bodies but not then. C.S. Lewis says, if we let him he will make the feeblest and filthiest of us into a dazzling,  radiant immortal creature, pulsating all through with such energy and joy and wisdom and  love as we cannot now imagine. He can make us into bright, stainless mirrors which reflect back to God perfectly though  of course on a smaller scale his own boundless power and delight and goodness. That is what we are in for, nothing less, a mirror reflecting back but there's another  way to do it.

His friend, Lewis's friend J.R. Tolkien in one place and one of his fictional pieces,  one of his characters dies and when he dies he lies in state and this is what it says  about. Tolkien and Lewis were Christians struggling to come to grips with what the future glory  looked like and we're told this man dies and he's lying in state and this is what it's  how he describes him. A great beauty was revealed in him and all who came there looked on him in wonder, for  they saw that the grace of his youth, the valor of his manhood, the wisdom and majesty  of his age were all blended together and long there he lay an image of the kings of  men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world. So what Tolkien is trying to get across is for example see there is a beauty that children  have that they lose but then there's another beauty that young men and women have you know  in their prime, physical prime that the children didn't have and that older people don't  have but then there's a majesty and a wisdom and a nobility about older people that the  younger people don't have but in all these beauties and these glories of course are just  sort of spread out but then they'll all be united.

They'll all be united. Paul says we will be different, we'll be ourselves and yet he says star differs from  star and glory. Every star is different, they're all, every single one of them is different. They'll all be different but will be stars and not only that will not only be our bodies  and not only will be beautiful bodies but they will be powerful. Paul says it is sewn in weakness.

The body is sewn in weakness but it's raised in power and then he goes a little further  and says it's sewn in natural body, it's raised a spiritual body. What is that? In fact think about that, isn't that a category mistake? It's raised a spiritual body, that doesn't make any sense. See in our categories you either a spirit or your body, you're either a spirit or your  body.

Well come on Paul, will we be spirits or will we be bodies and Paul says yeah. In fact Jesus comes through the doors, he comes through locked doors and they say oh  it's a ghost remember this, Luke 24, the resurrected Christ comes through locked doors  and they say oh as a ghost he says give me a fish and he eats the fish, he says I have a spirit  have not flesh and bones, touch me, watch me, a spiritual body, run it not be weary, walk  and not faint, right now you've got five senses, what if there is a thousand senses  will have? Who knows? Let us know, let us now draw the veil over this because I don't know that we can, we  know much more in the way of details. But do you think about your future, resurrected, perfect bodies and glory cells?

I'm sure it's possible to think too much about it but I don't think that's most of, I  don't think that's the problem that most of us have. The reason why you're so angry because you haven't lost the weight and it looks like  you're never going to be as good looking or as fit or as glorious as you want to be is  because you're not thinking. We need to be good stewards of our body, be as good a steward as you possibly can but  don't put your hopes there. The power you want, the glory you want, you know, there's a you in there that will never  come out till this moment, till the spirit gives life to your mortal body, to the redemption  we wait and eat your longing for the redemption of our bodies. But that's not all by the way, that is not all.

The world in which we're going to live when the spirit does its work is a renewed natural  world. Verse 19, just for a minute, just to point out that along with the resurrection of our  bodies comes verses 19, 20 and 21, which is absolutely astonishing. Tomorrow is giving Tuesday and we want you to know about a special opportunity we have  this year. As you may know, gospel and life supports Redeemer City to City, a ministry dedicated  to growing gospel movements in cities around the world through church planting. City to City was co-founded by Tim Keller and he cared deeply about this mission.

And this coming year at a 2026 training event in Kenya, City to City will help train, coach  and support two cohorts of 20 pastors planting churches all over Africa. This giving Tuesday, we have a goal to raise $150,000 to help sponsor the church planters  attending this training intensive in Nairobi, Kenya, so that City to City can help and support  these church planters to start churches across Africa. This work is vital to the spread of the gospel in African cities from Kampala to Lagos to  Johannesburg. So, as you think about how you may give on giving Tuesday, please consider making a gift  to gospel in life. Every dollar we receive on giving Tuesday will go directly to the work City to City is  doing to help start new churches in Africa in 2026.

To make a gift tomorrow, visit gospelonlife.com slash Tuesday. Again, as gospelonlife.com slash Tuesday. And thank you for your generous and faithful support of this ministry. Now, here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's message.  1921, what's it say?

It says the creation, and that's by the way, the natural world. That's the mountains and the animals, you know, and the trees. It says the creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to frustration not by its own choice, but by the will of  the one who subjected it in hope, that the creation itself will be liberated from bondage  to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God. What?

What? It says three things. And actually, we don't know much about those three things, but we do know these three  things. It says that nature, the natural world, is not what it should be because of us. Somehow, our sin has brought about a fallenness in nature, so even nature is not what it should  be.

It's frustrated. It's not all that God meant it to be. It's in bondage to decay. That's the first thing. Secondly, it knows it.

It knows it's not what it should be, and it's longing to be liberated. And what in the world does Paul mean by that? How could the trees in the animal? What is he saying? And of course, on the one hand, I hope you know, he's not doing fairy tale stuff.

He's not saying, well, you know, the trees in the animals could talk, but when you're around  they don't. He's not saying that, but I'll tell you what he is saying. He is saying that the creation has a life of its own. It's made also by God to glorify him, just like you are. From 19 says the heavens, this natural world glorifies God, and as such, they are fellow  creatures, the trees in the animals, and they have a life of their own, and they deserve  an enormous amount of respect.

But here's one of the reasons why. Somehow the creation, in its own way, knows it's creator better than you and I. Some years ago, that's what it's saying. Some years ago, remember, Elizabeth Elley had a teacher of mine at Gordon Conwell Seminary  years ago. Someone said, if you understood these things, she said, you would be humble before a very  clam.

You know why? Because the clams are doing a better job of being the clams, God meant them to be, than  you are, being the man or the woman God meant you to be. You fall far shorter from what we're supposed to be. You fall short. Are you the man God wants you to be?

But no, clams are much closer. They're glorifying God far more than you are. They, in a sense, know the creation knows there's something wrong, and it's long for the  resurrection in a way the human race is not. But when did you see the last line there, the last part? The creation will be liberated from its bondage decay, decay how?

It'll be brought into our freedom, and what that means is. And the Holy Spirit descends upon us to give us the redemption, the final redemption,  the final glorification of ourselves and our bodies. It's going to be an explosion of such love and power and glory that will bring all of  nature with it. Nature will come into what it should be on our co-tales. Isn't this something?

And let me just do a little reasoning with you for a second. He's saying, God says, for example, in Exodus 19 to his people, you are my treasured possession  though the whole earth is mine, Exodus 19. You are my treasured possession to the whole earth is mine. What he's saying is, as much as I love the earth, as much as I love the stars and the  moons, as much as I love the mountains and the trees and the animals, as much as I love  the earth, I love you the most. You are the most treasured possession, and you know what this means?

It's nature that actually comes in on our co-tales, what that means is this. It's astounding to me when you go out and look at the beauty of nature, when you look  at the beauty of the mountains and the beauty of the ocean to think that it's just a shadow  of what it's going to be. Current nature is just a shadow of its future, glorious self, right? And yet we are going to be more glorious than the future, renewed nature. And that's what the Holy Spirit will do.

Because the Holy Spirit's job is to get rid of the suffering, get rid of the bondage,  get rid of the brokenness, get rid of the groaning. That's what it's going to do in the future, so you say, ah, does that mean that's it? We just have to wait for that. We're groaning now, we're suffering now. Notice that?

We in really groan, nature is groaning. And the word groaning, by the way, that comes up three or four times in here is a word  that means to be in pain. People groan when they're dying, people groan when they're in labor, people groan when  they're in terrible, searing pain. Now we live in a time of groaning now, we groan, nature groans. So we say, okay, eventually all the groaning will be over, all the suffering will be over,  that's the job of the Spirit wonderful, but right now we're on our own, no.

Here we are in point two, by the way, those of you who care. The Holy Spirit's job is to deal with suffering and groaning. It's to deal with the brokenness of our lives. That's what we're being told, and eventually he's going to deal with it completely, but  he doesn't leave us on our own now, oh no. He's already in our lives to help us with the groaning.

We groan inwardly and we're in trouble. You know, remember the line from the great poet, it's, you know, things fall apart. The center cannot hold. Mayor Anarchy is loose upon the world. That's true.

Everything's falling apart. Your body's falling apart. Your relationships are falling apart. Your families are falling apart. Your communities are falling apart.

Everything's falling apart. Institutions, movements, they all fall apart. He said, what do you mean? They die. People move.

People fight. There's an entropy about everything in this world. We groan. Things are always falling apart, but the Holy Spirit has come into our lives as the first  fruits of that future glory. See, verse 23, not only so, but we ourselves who have the first fruits of the Spirit.

That word first fruit is so crucial. What that first fruit means, the first day's gathering from the harvest, even though they're  going to spend two more weeks and they're going to bring in all the wheat or they're  going to bring in all the corn. But the first day, you gather the corn or the wheat that's coming, you gather some now  and you eat it. It's a foretaste of the future feast. It's a down payment on the future fortune.

It's a real piece of the future. And what we're told is, with the Holy Spirit, this wonderful person and power who in the  future is going to deal with our groanings and suffering completely is in our lives now. We get a foretaste of that glory that enables us to handle the groanings and suffering  of life now. That's what this text is telling us. And in two ways, I'll use the image of sailing and rowing.

You know, sailing, you move through because the wind is to your back. In rowing, you've got no wind or maybe the wind in your face, but with exertion, you  can still get home. So when you're in the midst of groaning and suffering, there's two ways that the Holy  Spirit helps you, but He does. The first one is at the top versus 15, 16, 17. It says, the Spirit bears witness with our spirits that we're children of God.

It shores us that we're His children. In fact, it says, the Spirit testifies with our spirit that we, by Him, by the Spirit,  we cry Abba. The word Abba is the Aramaic term for daddy or papa. And what that means is, the Spirit gives us such confidence that God loves us, that we're  able to rely on Him and reach out to Him the way a little child reaches out to the Father. And see, that's what I mean by sailing.

Sometimes, in spite of all the troubles around us, God gives us this joy, this sense of His  reality, by the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Sonship, crying Abba, assurance that we're His,  but not always. Sometimes the Holy Spirit helps us in more difficult times than that. Sometimes the only way to get home is not through sailing because nothing's working. Somebody of the things that the Holy Spirit does, He changes you through the fruit of the  Spirit. He illuminates you by helping you understand God.

He empowers you to use your gifts, but sometimes nothing's going right at all. You're not seeing anybody change your life. God doesn't seem real to you, prayer is dry. You're not getting any prayers answered. And yet the Spirit doesn't abandon you.

Look at verse 26 and 27, in the same way, there's just 26, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with  groans that words cannot express. Sometimes we don't even know what to pray for. See, that's where we're in the depths. We don't even know what to pray for.

We're so overwhelmed with our troubles. We're groaning, you might say, so deeply and so loudly. And yet the Spirit is with us in those times, and I think over the years as I've thought  about that, I, in other words, sometimes the Spirit doesn't give us the joy that knows  no bounds. Sometimes the Spirit just gives us the peace that passes understanding so we can keep  rowing, so we can just keep doing the next thing, so we can just know God's with us even  now we don't feel them. You know how many of those Psalms, there's 150 Psalms, but I tell you, an awful lot of,  like half of them, or the Psalmist starts off by wrestling unhappy, angry, what's going  on?

I don't understand. Things are terrible. Oh, Lord, why are you letting all this happen? But the very end, he says, he wrestles through the end and says, but I know I believe I will  see the goodness of the Lord and the land of the living. And I think what he's, what happens is he just knows in his soul in spite of the fact  that everything else seems to be saying there is no God or God doesn't care or who cares  about God in his soul, he says, no, no, no, no, no, I know, I know, I know he's there,  I know he's not going to leave me like this, I'm going to do the next thing, I'm going  to pray, I'm going to read my Bible even though I'm not getting anything out of it.

You're rowing, and it's because of the Spirit's there helping you. The Spirit cares about your groaning and your suffering, that's his job. Some day to end it all, but even now to help you. Now let's not, we're not done, and here's the reason why. If you're a New Yorker is your practical, and New Yorkers say, this is all very inspiring,  but how do I really, how do I actually do this?

How do I do this? You talk about this wonderful future and this wonderful future, but it's supposed to  be somehow helping me now. I don't see how. How can I know? Well, here's the way.

The thing that activates the future so that it affects you now is assured hope. Verse 24, 25, in this hope we are saved, but if we hope for what we do not yet have, we  wait for it patiently. There's your, that's what you need, patience, poise, stick tillidiveness, how? It's through hope. Do you know how important hope is?

Hope is an assured future. Imagine two women, and both of them have a purse, and in that purse is all the assets and  money they have in the world. Everything they have in the world is in that purse, $1,000 in cash, that's it, they both  have $1,000 in cash, that's all they have. The difference is that woman knows that tomorrow, for some reasons, a $10 million will  be wired into her bank account. And the other woman knows that there's nothing coming from anybody for the indefinite future.

And imagine those two women go out in New York City and they both have the very same experience  somebody snatches their purse, their purses are lost, they're taken, they're stolen. How are they going to respond to that? I can tell you this, the woman who knows that tomorrow, $10 million is coming to her  bank account, says, what an inconvenience, oh well. And the other woman is in total despair. Do you know why?

Same circumstances, why is the response so different? Because what you know about the future completely determines how you process the present. What you know about the future, your understanding of your own future completely determines how  you process the present. How can you know that the redemption of your body is coming? How can you know that that's your future?

If you knew it, if you were sure of it, you could face anything because a whole lot better  than $10 million is coming into your bank account. How can you be sure? Here's how you can be sure. Many people, commentators have been wondering, so over the years, how could the Spirit  groan? You notice in verse 26, it says that when the Spirit is with us and all of our trouble,  it says, the Spirit intercedes for us with groans, which means the Spirit is suffering.

And many commentators are saying, how could the divine and mortal Spirit of God suffer? Jesus, in Mark chapter 7, takes a little deaf mute, a man who's been really suffered  his whole life aside. He wants to heal him. And as he's about to heal him, he looks to heaven, and he groans, the same word. That means he's in pain.

Why? Why doesn't he just say, ha ha, way to you see what I'm going to do? Why? Why is he groaning in pain? Well, the first answer is, because here's a man who's so loving and so vulnerable in  his love, that he can emotionally identify with a suffering man that he's just met.

And he feels the man's suffering himself. But the ultimate reason is he knows that in order to deliver him and us from his groaning  and suffering, Jesus is himself going to have to be plunged into suffering and groaning  to deficit. No one else has ever been, you know, sent. Because when Jesus on the cross says, my God, my God, why has the offer shaken me? He's quoting Psalm 22, right?

But Psalm 22, verse 1, which would have been in Jesus head as he's dying, here's the  full verse. My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me? So far from the words of my groaning, Jesus groaned in pain and got abandoned him. I'm groaning and got abandoned him.

Why? Because he got the abandonment that our sins deserve so that you can know, know, that whenever  you groan, God will not abandon you, that he's with you. So you can't face the groaning and suffering of this life without certainty about your  future. And you can't be certain about your future unless you know that because Jesus Christ  died for you and went through that for you, that even though you fail and even though  you don't live the life you ought to live and even though your faith is imperfect and  even though your repentance needs to be repented of, God is there with you, the Holy Spirit  is there with you. He will not abandon you.

The implications of this are astounding, are they not? If God loves the world, this material world like this, should we care for creation and  environment? Yes. If God only, of all the religions of the world, only the Bible says that this world is permanent  and this material world is a permanent and that's a terrific incentive to fight against  disease and hunger, is it not? And if you're facing death, what better?

You can laugh in the face of death with this. And if any of you are chronically sick or even just getting old and almost come to the place  where you feel like my body is my enemy, it's not. I want you to hear that. It's not. It's sin and evil in your body that's the enemy but you're sin and evil's in your soul  and it's in the world and we are without hope unless he gives us the victory, oh God,  he must give us the victory and he will.

Let us pray. Our Father, help us take the theology of this passage. It should make us zealous for caring for material needs. It should make us powerful in the face of our own sickness and even impending death. It should fill us with such hope that we are able to face the worst groaning and suffering  because we know that someday your spirit will end it all.

Father, we like the rest of creation long for the final redemption of our bodies and  until then, holy spirit, help us, help us to have the joy and the peace of past understanding  and the midst of what we have to face. Thank you for all these assurances. Make us people with zeal and joy but who also know how to weep with those who weep because  we know these great truths, we pray this in Jesus' name, Amen.

### 引言：圣灵的角色

欢迎来到福音与生活！圣灵是谁？为什么圣灵的工作对基督徒的生活如此重要？圣经告诉我们，圣灵不仅仅是一个模糊的力量，而是一个在基督徒生活中以深刻方式工作的位格。今天，Tim Keller 探讨圣灵如何呼召我们信仰，将我们联合在一起，装备我们以恩赐，并塑造我们更像基督。

今晚的经文来自罗马书第八章，第15到27节。

> 因为你们所受的，不是奴仆的灵，仍旧害怕；所受的乃是儿子的灵，因此我们呼叫：阿爸，父！圣灵与我们的心同证我们是神的儿女。

**圣灵呼召我们并使我们能够相信。**

### 圣灵未来的工作

#### 1. 荣耀化

罗马书第八章是一个惊人的章节，在第八章和第30节，我们读到：“他所召的那些人，又称他们为义；所称为义的人，又叫他们得荣耀。”他不仅仅停在称义，他称义的同时也使我们得荣耀。我们将要得荣耀。

- **我们已经得救，但我们将要得救。**
- 救赎意味着被购买，从束缚中赎出。

#### 2. 我们身体的救赎

希腊人认为身体是坏的，但圣经有不同的看法。**你最终的救赎甚至不是去天堂。**你最终的救赎是在时间的尽头，当你复活并拥有一个新的荣耀的身体时。

### 圣灵现在的帮助

#### 1. 确信

圣灵与我们的心同证我们是神的儿女。它确保我们是他的孩子。**圣灵给我们如此的信心，知道神爱我们。**

#### 2. 代求

有时我们甚至不知道该祷告什么。**圣灵亲自用说不出来的叹息替我们祷告。**

### 盼望的确据

**盼望是一个确定的未来。**你对未来的了解完全决定了你如何处理现在。

- **圣灵与我们一同叹息。**
- 耶稣在痛苦中叹息，神离弃了他，以便你可以知道，无论何时你叹息，神都不会离弃你。

让我们祷告。

我们的父，帮助我们理解这段经文的神学。它应该使我们热心关心物质需求。它应该使我们在面对自己的疾病甚至即将到来的死亡时充满力量。它应该充满我们如此的盼望，使我们能够面对最严重的叹息和痛苦，因为我们知道有一天你的灵会结束这一切。父啊，我们像其他受造物一样，渴望我们身体的最终救赎，直到那时，圣灵，帮助我们，帮助我们在我们必须面对的事情中拥有超越理解的喜乐与平安。感谢你给予我们的所有保证。使我们成为充满热情和喜乐的人，但也知道如何与那些哭泣的人同哭，因为我们知道这些伟大的真理，我们奉耶稣的名祷告，阿门。
