Welcome to Gospel in Life. How comfortable are you when it comes to being open about your faith? This month on the podcast, Tim Keller looks at what the Bible says about having a public  faith. He shows us what it looks like to be open about our faith in a pluralistic society in a way  that creates civility and peace and meaningful dialogue with our neighbors. Tonight's scripture reading comes from Exodus, chapter 3, verses 1 through 14.

Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and  he led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horib, the mountain of God. There an angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that the bush was on fire and it did not burn up. So Moses thought, I will go over and see the strange sight why the bush does not burn  up. When the Lord saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush.

Moses, Moses, and Moses said, here I am. Do not come any closer, God said. Take off your sandals for the place where you are standing as holy ground. Then he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the  God of Jacob. At this Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at God.

The Lord said, I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers and I am concerned about their  suffering. So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and bring them up  out of that land into a good and spacious land. A land flowing with milk and honey, the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Parasites,  Hivites, and Jebysites. And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me and I have seen the way the Egyptians are  oppressing them.

So now go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt. But Moses said to God, who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out  of Egypt? And God said, I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you.

When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain. Moses said to God, suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, the God of your fathers has  sent me to you and they ask me, what is his name? Then what shall I tell them? God said to Moses, I am who I am. This is what you are to say to the Israelites.

I am has sent me to you. The word of the Lord, thanks be to God. Now, each week we are looking at the subject of how we can talk about our deepest faith  beliefs in public, how can we share who we are, our deep faith beliefs, but in such a  way that is respectful, promotes peace, and I have observed over the years that one  of the best ways of having a discussion about faith publicly is to not simply talk about  what you believe, but also how you came to believe it. Not just do the content, but the process or the journey that you went on, you know, it's  not just, here's what I believe, but how did you come to believe what you believe? How did you come to have faith in the God you have faith in?

It's a journey account, or some people would call it a personal testimony, and I think  it lowers the temperature, because when you're not just saying, here's what I believe,  no, here's what I believe, you're talking about the process and the experience by which  you came to your faith, I think it commands a certain respect, you know, you listen to  what person's account of their experience, I think it also very often is helpful because  everybody's on a process, and to hear how you went through your process is helpful. And so in order to help us think about how we can think about this, is we're looking  at this passage, which is very famous, Moses in the Burning Bush, there's an awful, Leo  and I were up here just talking about maybe some of you were on the generation, but it's  hard for me not to think of Charlton Heston, and Cecil B. DeMille's voice or whoever's  voice coming from the Burning Bush, I mean, it's a very famous, that was the movie Ten  Commandments, some of you movies you used to go and watch them on big screens and things  like that, I know it's sorry, it's kind of ancient history, but it's actually, this account  is here, and we're looking at it tonight because it's Moses' conversion experience. This is Moses' conversion experience. This is how he didn't just come to believe in God, he already believed in God.

In fact, when God speaks to him, he says, look, I'm the God of your father, the God of Abraham,  Isaac and Jacob, when he says that, he's saying, I'm the God you believe in, actually, I'm  the God of your father, the God of your father, he knows that Moses believes in this God,  he's never encountered him, he's never had a face-to-face experience with him, he hasn't  met him, and therefore it can be said that this is Moses' conversion experience, and so  if we see how he didn't come just to believe in God, but actually meet God, we're going  to see four things that brought him to that, and I think there's the same four things  that the Bible says you have to have usually happen in your life if you're going to meet  him as well. So, if Moses met him this way, we need these four things, usually, in order to actually  experience and meet God, what are those four things? They are a disrupting sight, an expanding concept, a personal problem, and a surprising  grace. Okay, so first, a disrupting sight. The first thing that brings Moses to actually meet God is the bush itself, verse two and  three.

Moses saw that though the bush was on fire, it did not burn up, so Moses thought, I will  go over and see this strange sight, why the bush is not consumed, does not burn up. Now, Moses probably originally saw a brush fire over here, some distance, but that wasn't  all that unusual, there's a lot of reasons why you can have brush fires in the desert,  but what caught his attention was this fire didn't go out, and as you can imagine, brush fires  are fast, why? Because there's no fuel out there, a bush, or some brush isn't much in the way of fuel,  so fires that do happen out there because of lightning or for other whatever reason, or  maybe some other shepherd who went by and left a campfire going. If you are going to have a brush fire, it goes out quickly, but evidently this bush kept  burning and burning and burning and burning, and we're told that Moses decided, I better  go see what this is, why? Because that doesn't make sense, it doesn't fit, that's impossible, a bush has to burn  out, I mean the fire consumes the bush and then it goes out, why is the bush continued  to burn, why is the fire continued to burn, and we're told he went over, see twice it  uses this word, I will go over and see this strange sight, verse 4, it says, the Lord  saw that he had gone over, that is a Hebrew word that means the detour, he let himself  be interrupted, his normal path was interrupted, okay, what's the first principle, here's the  first principle, ordinarily you don't meet God unless something comes into your life that  you can't account for and disrupts your life or disrupts your thinking, very often seriously  disrupts and interrupts you, what Moses saw the burning bush didn't fit his understanding  of what could happen, because it didn't fit, he went over to see it and figure it out  and consider it and so forth, and we usually do not come to faith in God, just simply by thinking  about it, we usually have to have something that comes into our life that disrupts us,  that we can't account for, and that makes us think in ways we didn't before.

Thomas Kuhn wrote a book in the mid 20th century called The Structure of Scientific Revolutions  which explains this, it's an academic book that you probably have not heard of and yet you  have probably because it was very famous, at least maybe not by name, Kuhn was writing  about how science works, the Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn tried, he was a philosopher  of science, historian of science, and he said, actually science does not move forward  the way you tend to say, scientists like to say, I'm objective and when I get a new bit  of data, I look at it, and if I follow the evidence wherever it leads and so I'm gradually  making small changes, I'm getting more evidence, I'm getting clear of you and I'm changing  my views in the court with the evidence, and Kuhn says now, that's not how it works. Kuhn says, we are very close minded, all of us, we are not open to new evidence and he says  all of us tend to have interpretive grids by which we interpret reality. Now a grid is what he called a paradigm, so yes, actually he, I think, popularized the term  paradigm, a paradigm is a way of looking at reality. And Kuhn says, we really have those views, these interpretive grids, these ways of looking  at reality, and when new evidence comes along we do everything we can to use that evidence  to confirm what we already believe. We do everything we can to work it in, now I'll tell you, one of the perfect, to me examples  of that was 9-11.

Here we all are all looking at the same horrible thing that happened, we're looking right  at it, there it is. But there were some people who had an interpretive grid that said, America is the bad guys  in the world. We're a force for materialism and abuse of power, whatever, we're the bad guys in the  world. And there was another people who said, America is the good guy, we're the force of good  on the side of good against evil. So once as America is a good guy, once as America is a bad guy, it's amazing, I read the essays  of people after 9-11, we were looking at the very same thing and everybody used it to  say, see, this is what I always said, this is what I always believed.

See 9-11, that proves that we're the bad guy, the world hates us. See 9-11, other people said, that proves that we're the good people and we have evil  on against us. We had two different groups of people with two different paradigms, they were totally  opposite to each other, they were looking at the same bit of data and using it to support  the paradigm. Thomas Koon says, we're not open-minded people, we have our set of beliefs and when a piece  of data comes, we use it to confirm what we already believe, except Koon says, sometimes  stuff comes into our lives that this rubs. Sometimes stuff comes into our lives that we can't really account for in the grid, it  doesn't really fit, it's difficult to work it in.

Koon's example, of course, the classic example was our Western understanding of the solar  system. Koon said, for years, people believed that the earth was fixed and the earth was in the  center and there were all these other bodies orbiting around it and of course that seemed  to explain. You looked up in the sky and you could see other bodies moving and we said, of course, they're  all orbiting around us and so every time you got a new bit of data, we found a new planet,  we found another, you know, the astronomers found another heavenly body, they said of course  that fits into the grid and then Koon says, what began to happen was some of the bodies  that we saw in space didn't seem to fit. Their movements didn't seem to work into this idea that everything was orbiting around  earth. Some of them kind of moved infinitely like zigzags in the sky and that didn't seem to  really work.

Koon says, what happens eventually is enough data comes in, you can't account for or something  comes in, you can't account for and it leads you to question the grid itself and you sit  there and say, oh, maybe I got it wrong and you try on, it's like trying on a dress,  you try on a new paradigm, you try something else on and you say, well, maybe the earth  is orbiting too. And when you try that paradigm on, suddenly it makes sense of all the data and you have  what he calls a paradigm shift, it's like a conversion, suddenly you realize if I change  the grid then suddenly I can explain everything else and you have this enormous shift so  he says basically because we're so close-minded, we do not move, we don't change our bodies  little by little, instead we try to work everything into confirm our existing paradigms  until something comes in a burning bush, something that doesn't fit, something you can't  account for, you try on a new way of thinking and it creates a shift, basically a kind  of conversion. Now, that's how it is with God, usually, usually something comes into your life, it's  a burning bush and you can't account for it. You've got to set a belief, either you don't believe in God or you believe whether  probably is a God but nobody knows, you either have an inconsequential God or you have  no God or something like that, a God that you don't need to know in order to live life  and then something comes into your life and you can't account for it. It could be a train of thought, we've talked about this in the last couple of weeks, you  know, WHO, who lived here in the Upper East Side in World War II, Great British Poet, didn't  believe in God, but World War II came, we talked about this at length in the last couple  of weeks.

World War II comes along, WHO sees the Nazis what they're doing and he says, wait a minute,  there's no God, what right do I have to say that my values are right and there's a wrong? If there's no God, what warrant do I have for saying I'm right and they're wrong? And so he's thought like this, if there's no God, all morality is relative but no, morality  is not relative, what they're doing is wrong and therefore there must be a God. The train of thought came along that didn't fit in to his grid and he had a paradigm shift. He had a change in it, he questioned the grid itself so it can be kind of an intellectual  burning bush, a train of thought, but very often it's something else.

Years ago when Redeemer got started and we had a few hundred people, you know, actually  in the early days, I mean the first couple of years, this body was about the size of  Redeemer, the whole of Redeemer. And we were, this is the late 80s, early 90s and we were just normal New Yorkers, we were  people who worked in Wall Street, worked in the arts, you know, worked in fashion, just  normal New Yorkers, but I used to find that if you brought a person in, the average man  had 99.9% of the average man had nights didn't believe in historic Christianity or anything  like that. But if they came in and they just sat down and they realized we all believed in historic  Christianity, they were here for about 10 or 15 minutes, they started having paradigm shifts. Redeemer itself was a burning bush, you know why? Because in their grid, people like them, people who'd gone to the same schools, people  who did the same jobs, people like them didn't believe in Christianity, see, it was just  not done, nobody did it except here's a few hundred people that were doing it.

So what are we going to do about that? And suddenly Redeemer itself sometimes was a burning bush, you could just see little  paradigm meltdowns, you know, it was coming out of their ears, you know, the paradigm,  the old paradigm, there was a shift going on, they couldn't quite account for people  that were, you know, we weren't brilliant, we're just normal, and normal people don't have  these beliefs, how could you believe that? Or sometimes a Christian comes into your life and maybe you're not a believer, and  the Christian is just so much more wise or so much more poised or so much more intelligent  and we're so much more thoughtful than you thought Christians could be and the Christian  itself is like a burning bush. We're very often, one more thing before going on, very often disillusioning and difficult  experiences, very often they're the burning bush. They come into your life and you're saying, look, I don't know if there's a God, there  might be, there might not, I don't need to know God, that's your grid, which means your  assumption is I can handle life, I can handle life, you know, I'm smart, I'm savvy,  you know, I've got, I've got a therapist, you know, I've got friends, you know, I'm  not stupid, you know, I know life isn't easy but I can handle life.

David Martin Lloyd-Jones was a physician, a young physician in Britain in the 1920s. He became a Christian, he got converted and went into the ministry after that, but he  tells about his conversion and a big part of it was this. He believed, well, a big part of it was this, a man that he admired, an older man who  was a physician and everything he wanted to be, you see, in that day and time, the best  physicians in Britain, they were heroes, they were emulated, they were, you know, they  were saving lives, they were respected, they were brilliant, they were, they were well paid,  they had enormous status and it was one of those men that Lloyd-Jones looked up to and  wanted to be like, he was dating a woman and she died, great tragedy. He came by to see Lloyd-Jones and he says, hey, it'd be okay if I stayed here for a little  bit and Lloyd-Jones says, oh, it's up to the fire and the man, Lloyd-Jones says, the man  pulled up a chair to the fire and sat down and stared at the fire for two hours, didn't  say a word. He also didn't act as if Lloyd-Jones was there.

Now, Lloyd-Jones did not have his feelings hurt and he didn't feel, in any way, that  was inappropriate. It was perfectly appropriate but when he saw one of the men, that he, a world-beater,  a person that he thought, that he wanted to be like and he realized this man was absolutely  out of resources. He had nothing left. He had nothing with which to actually face the normal realities of life. And Lloyd-Jones says, he looked at him staring at the fire and this is what he said.

He says, I suddenly saw the vanity of all human greatness. I suddenly saw the vanity of all human greatness. What was going on there? In that young man's mind, it was a burning bush. It was something that didn't fit.

He says, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, if a guy like this can't handle  life, how in the world do I think I can handle life without God? So, but here's the point. When these things come into your life and they start to challenge you and they start  to make you question the grid, are you willing to go over? Like Moses. You know, if Moses hadn't gone over, if he actually said, I don't want to be bothered,  he would have never heard of Moses.

See, once you get bothered, you have to be willing to think it out. You have to have the guts to think it out and be willing to think it out. We always say the gospel changes everything and we believe it really does. That's why here at Gospel and Life, August is Go and Share Month. Throughout August, we're inviting thousands of our listeners to take a small step in  sharing the gospel with someone God has placed in your life.

For those of you who make a gift to Gospel and Life this month, we'll send you two copies  of making sense of God by Tim Keller. It's a powerful resource that explores how Christianity makes emotional, cultural, and  rational sense in today's world. It's our thanks for your gift and provides a way you can do a small act to share the gospel  by reading the book with a friend, giving one to a coworker or passing on both copies  to people who are exploring the Christian faith. It's a simple way to start a gospel conversation or continue it. To request your two copies of making sense of God, simply go to gospelandlife.com-slash-give.

Again, that's gospelandlife.com-slash-give. Now, here's Dr. Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. Barbara Brown Taylor, in her famous sermon on the burning bush, says, imagine if Moses  had just hunched down over his shoulders and kept his head down and just stayed busy. What if Moses had said, burning bush?

I didn't really see it. I don't know what that is. Burning bush? Well, probably there's some rational explanation anyway. Burning bush.

I've been paid to watch sheep, not turn aside and look at bushes. Burning bush, would somebody please put that out? If he had done that, you never would have heard of him. He would never met God. God would never have spoken to him and the same thing would happen to you.

He got to turn aside, okay? So I disrupting sight. Second and third, they kind of go together. Second and third, if you're really going to meet God, secondly, you have to have an expanding  concept of God. Now, what do I mean by expanding concept?

Well, let's look at this idea of God revealing himself as fire. Why does God reveal himself as fire? One of the reasons is he's getting across one of the most mind-numbing, amazing things  that the Bible says about God. See, the reason Moses went to see the bush was bushes are usually dependent on the,  I mean, pardon me, fire is usually dependent on the bush. It's dependent on the bush for fuel.

And therefore, fires don't stay going forever because they have to have fuel. And after they consume the fuel, they're gone. Why? They're dependent on the fuel. But this fire wasn't dependent on the bush.

It wasn't dependent on anything. It had its own power of being within it, which of course was a miracle. But what is that symbolized? And symbolizes what God says about himself at the very end. When Moses says, well, who should I say has sent me to Israel?

What's your name in other words? And you know what God says? I'll tell you what my name is. He says, I am who I am. Tell them, I am has sent you.

Now it's actually really hard to translate this. What God really gives Moses, actually, as his name, is just the Hebrew verb to be. It's like he's almost saying, tell them being itself sent you. I am what I am, I am who I am, but basically being itself. And here's what he's saying.

I depend on nothing. Everything depends on me. I am self-sufficient. I have the power of all being in myself. I am the ground of all being.

You know, when the Bible says God has no ending, we can kind of imagine that, I guess. But when the Bible says God has no beginning, that's where my brain starts to melt. But it has to be, why? Because if something has a beginning, it's because something begins it. And if God had a beginning and something would have begun God, and whatever that something  was, God would have been dependent on, but God is saying, I am dependent on nothing.

All existence has its existence only in me. I'm at the heart of every molecule. I'm holding everything together. Hebrew is one one talks about that. In him, all things consist.

And so what God is trying to say here is that I am existence itself. I am being itself. I'm the ground of all being. I'm not just a being, I am being. I'm not just a being, I am being.

I am that I am. Jesus put it slightly more personal terms without him you can do nothing. Now here's what I'm trying to say at this point. We could talk a lot about this, and this is the name that God reveals here. But what I'm trying to show you is this, Moses is having an expanding understanding of  God.

He had a view of God, but what is this? In general, when people talk to me about not being able to believe in God. In general, I can ask them, well tell me what you don't believe in, and tell me why  it's hard to believe in God. And they always describe why I can't believe in a God who does this, I can't, and it's  I'd say four times out of five, after they tell me what they don't like about God and  why they can't believe in God. Four times out of five, I can say, oh, this is great.

I don't believe in that God either. The God you're talking about is not the God I believe in, they say what? That's always the God that people disbelieve in is a flat God, a reductionist to God, a reduced  God. Nothing like the multi-dimensional rich, rich God of the Bible. The Bible's talking about God is this, but he's also this, he's this, but he's also this,  and paradoxically he's this, and he's also this, and the simpler your understanding of God  is, the more rejectable it is.

And I'll go so far as to say, the richer and more nuanced your understanding of God,  the harder it is to reject him and the easier it is to believe in him. Certainly, the harder it is to just reject him out of hand. And what Moses was getting is an expanding understanding of God, and you will, if you're  expanding and you're understanding of God, and getting a richer understanding of God,  you're moving in the right direction. So he had a disrupting side, he had an expanding concept. Thirdly, there was a personal problem.

Now what do I mean by personal problem? Let's go back to the fire. There are a number of things that God was getting across with fire, and here's one of them. Fire is so beautiful and so scary at once. It is so brilliant and so attractive and so dangerous and so frightening at once.

Look. Moses said, here I am, verse 5, do not come any closer, God said, take off your sandals  for the place where you were standing is holy ground. At this Moses hit his face because he was afraid to look at God. Now Alec Matier, great Old Testament Bible scholar, says about this verse, that the holiness  of God is that part of God's nature that is dangerous for sinners like you and me. The holiness of God is that part of God's nature that is dangerous to sinners like  you and me.

And only we hear that, we New Yorkers say, I want a loving God, what do you mean? Dangerous? Dangerous? He's like fire. He's beautiful, but he's dangerous.

I don't think I like that, but actually, please think with me a little bit. Why is God dangerous? Why is the holiness of God his terrifying danger? Well, first two reasons. The holiness of God, first of all, means he exposes us through his perfection.

Come on, you know what this word, how this works. Whenever you're in the presence of absolute, incredible talent or beauty or brilliance,  when you're in the presence of a human being with excellence, it's just like fire. Why? It's wonderful and it's horrible. Look, you may think of yourself as not too bad looking person, then there's some people  you don't want to stand near them because you don't want people looking from you to him  or to her.

You don't want that. You know, you feel like I'm not so bad looking and then you get near somebody who makes  you ten times better looking and then you feel homely ugly. You may think of yourself as talented, you know, this is one of the true story, of course,  is that it happens very often. You may be the best violinist in hot coffee, Texas, little town, you know, and you get  off the train in New York City and there's somebody begging, you know, and grand social  station, you know, with a violin case open and people throw money in, they're playing  and they're way better than you. And you go, oh no, what's happening?

It's beautiful. I mean, violinist is beautiful. You say, well, that's beautiful, the technique, but you're scared to death. Whenever you get into the presence of something way better than you, it's horrible and wonderful. Well, how would that be true of God?

Of course it is. And this is one of the ways you know you're drawing near to the real God. When Isaiah went in to see the Holy One, high and lifted up, holy, holy, holy, he heard  the angel saying, he went into the temple and he saw the holiness of God and you've got  a figure. Isaiah, he's a prophet. Isaiah, compared to the most of the population, he would have to be more virtuous, more spiritual,  more moral, a better person than most, but what does he say about himself?

Unclean, he calls himself. Everything that Isaiah was proud of looked like trash. Because in the presence of power, you feel your weakness in the presence of beauty, you feel  your ugliness in the presence of light, you feel your darkness. And therefore God's dangerous because he is so holy and so perfect and so beautiful  that he's horrible. Because when you get near him, you have a self-quake, your self-image falls apart.

All the things you tell yourself, I'm not that bad a person, it's not true. It's just not true and you realize it's not true. All your self-justifications, all your little self-deceptions, the blindness we all have. Everybody knows that. We always sort of, that person is awful, that person is awful, but me, you have to understand.

You're always making excuses for yourself, but in the presence of God, it's incredibly traumatic. It's like a logically absolutely devastating. It's incredibly dangerous because God is so beautiful, He is dangerous. He shows you who you are. So His perfection exposes you, but also He is a God of active goodness.

The difference between active and passive goodness, there's been a lot of studies  that during the Holocaust in Germany, most Germans felt bad about the fact that the Jews  were disappearing. They justified it. They told themselves, well, they're just going to detention camps, I mean, they always,  they lied to themselves so they didn't want to admit, but basically, most Germans saw  the Jews just disappearing. They saw the Jewish neighbors just disappearing and they felt bad about it. Why?

People, but they're passively good. They didn't say anything. They didn't make waves. They were afraid to. As we all know, passive goodness isn't as good as active goodness and God is actively  good.

God is not just good in general. He doesn't tolerate evil, He doesn't tolerate evil in sin in you. And as a result, there's a danger. Now here's the third point, very important. If you're going to have an experience of God and counter God, it really ought to be a real God.

We are so affected by consumer capitalism and in consumer capitalism, we choose everything. We get what we want. Everything's customized to us. And so you don't you see what we tend to do? I do it.

Can't you do it? You get the God you want. You say, I don't like to believe in God like this. I like to believe in God like this. I hear people say this.

I like to think of God like this. I like to think of God like this. If you're creating your own God, it's just an extension of you. How's that guy going to be of any help to you? How's that guy going to give you any power?

It's just you. How's that guy going to be any resource? It's just you. If you're actually just creating God you like. So how are you going to be sure that you're drawing near to a real God, a real spiritual reality,  a true God, a living God?

How are you going to know that? And Jonathan Edwards, the great 18th century theologian philosopher says that most of the  attributes of God are attributes that we would choose if we were creating a God. You know, it'd be nice to have a powerful God because then if he's your God, then he  can help you. It'd be nice to have a merciful God, then if you're guilty he can forgive you. Almost all the attributes are attributes that we would choose, but there's one attribute  we would never choose, Edwards says, it's the holiness of God because it's just a problem.

The holiness is nothing but a problem, a big problem for us and if you are starting to  sense that this God that you're trying to come to grips with is holy and that you're  not just a good person who needs a spiritual boost from him and you're not just even a  needy person who needs fulfillment but that you're a sinner and you need forgiveness  and pardon. And you begin to actually sense that there's a problem and you've got a problem coming  into his presence. Now you have some confidence that you're not making this God up. Now you've got some confidence that you're on your way toward the real God because you  sense that you've got a personal problem, he's not just an abstraction, he's just trying  to believe in him but you've got a problem in relating to him and that brings us naturally  then the last thing you need would be you need some kind of grace, you need something  that will enable you to stand in God's presence. Moses is wondering about that.

Down here in verse 11 and 12, Moses says, but who am I that you would send me to Pharaoh  and then God says, I will be with you but if you go on in the text, you'll see Moses  is not modified here. Moses says, wait a minute, you're holy. He's starting to see who he is, what he's like and he begins to say, how in the world  am I? Well put it like this, the bush is not consumed but why isn't Moses? In Exodus 33, Moses actually asked God, can I see you face to face and God says no, you  can't, it will kill you.

Well then why is it not consumed right here? The bush isn't consumed, okay, it was a miracle but why isn't Moses consumed and the secret  and the answer, it's in the text but you probably went right by it, I do. Look all through here, it says God spoke to Moses out of the bush. God spoke to Moses out of the bush, God spoke to Moses out of the bush but who's actually  in the bush? It tells you in verse 2, the angel of the Lord.

Wait a minute you say that's weird, it says the angel was in the bush but then all the  way through the rest of the text it talks as if God's in the bush, yes, that's the way  it works in the Old Testament. There's this figure, this enigmatic figure named the angel of the Lord, not an angel of  the Lord, like Gabriel or somebody like that, the angel of the Lord and when the angel of  the Lord shows up, it's weird because on the one hand this angel of the Lord seems to be  a distinct person from God, on the other hand the angel of the Lord seems to be God. Like it'll say the angel of the Lord spoke to Abraham or the angel of the Lord spoke  to Moses but then the very next verse it'll say and God said to Moses and God said  Abraham, it's almost as if this person is both God and not God. But here's what's all so interesting, Alec Matier says, if you look carefully, the angel  of the Lord shows up when God wants to draw near to someone without destroying them. One of the most interesting spots is later on in the book of Exodus, Matier says there's  this argument going back and forth between Moses and God and Moses says, Lord, you must  your presence must go with us as the children of Israel leave Egypt and go toward the promised  line.

Your presence must go with us and God says no. My presence cannot go with you because you are rebellious people and my presence will  destroy you. And then Moses pushes back and says no, no, I'm not going to go unless you go with us and  then finally God says, Matier points this out in his commentary on Exodus. He finally says, wait, okay, I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'll send my angel with you.

And here's what Matier says about that. Moses says, I want your presence. God says no, it'll destroy you. Most I want your presence. Okay, I'll send you my angel.

And here's what Matier says in his commentary. He says the angel of the Lord is revealed as the merciful accommodation of God whereby  the Lord can be present among a sinful people when were he to go with them himself. God's presence would consume them. So the angel is that mode of deity whereby the holy God can keep company with sinners  without destroying them. And then Matier goes on and says, who would that be?

He says there is only one other in the Bible who is both identical with and yet distinct  from the Lord. One who while affirming the wrath of God is yet a supreme display of his mercy. The angel of the Lord can only be understood as a pre-incarnate appearance of Jesus Christ. And do you remember in John chapter 8, Jesus says to his listeners, before Abraham was  I am. He doesn't say before Abraham was I was.

That would have been weird enough. But he says before Abraham was I am. And what is he saying? He's saying, I'm the one who spoke to Moses from the bush. And now here's the secret.

Here's the answer to all the riddles. You say, well, how is Jesus Christ the angel of the Lord? How is Jesus Christ the way that we can be in the presence of God without being consumed? Oh my goodness, here it is. Here's how you can finally see the fire of God.

Fire is terrible and beautiful. And on the cross you see how terribly holy God is. He is so terribly holy that Jesus Christ had to die. God is actively good. God has to meet out punishment on sin.

Just can't be shrugged at. He is so terribly holy, Jesus had to die, but he is so beautifully loving, so beautifully  loving that in Jesus Christ he was willing to come and glad to die, willing to die, make  his own atonement. And there it is. We have hymns about this. One hymn goes, before the throne absolved we stand, thy love has met, thy laws demand.

Terrible, horrible, beautiful, gorgeous, and if you want to know the ravishing beauty of  this fiery God, a God who wants so holy that you got a problem with him and yet so loving  that he solved the problem at his own expense. If you say, I want to know that God, you will come to know that God, why? Because that's the God who reveals himself to Moses in the bush and that's the God who  reveals himself to people. And guess what will happen if you do that? If you believe in Jesus Christ, you will become a burning bush.

Moses did. Moses went out and changed the world. Why? Because the glory and the beauty of God came into his life. In fact, at one point he had to put a veil over his face and it didn't consume him.

Why? Well, he wasn't really sure. He just knew that somehow atonement had been made, but you and I know. Peter 1, verse 3 says, the Christians have been made partakers of the divine nature. Ephesians 2 says, we're temples of the Holy Spirit, the light and the uncommon light and  the beauty and the glory of God can come into your life and yet you not be consumed because  of the merits and mediation of Jesus Christ and then you become a little burning bush.

And you become someone who can, who people go over to see, to figure out because you're  inexplicable. When you become someone who can touch others or have God touch others through you and  you can change the world, do you believe in the God who revealed Himself to Moses and  the burning bush with us pray? Father, we thank you for giving us this pathway to experience of you and we ask that you  would help us now even as we participate in the Lord's Supper to know you. That is an abstract God but is a fiery loving God. We pray that you would help every Christian here experience your reality and everyone  here who is not yet know you also come to experience that reality we ask it in Jesus'  name.

### English Transcript (for reference)

Welcome to Gospel in Life. How comfortable are you when it comes to being open about your faith? This month on the podcast, Tim Keller looks at what the Bible says about having a public  faith. He shows us what it looks like to be open about our faith in a pluralistic society in a way  that creates civility and peace and meaningful dialogue with our neighbors. Tonight's scripture reading comes from Exodus, chapter 3, verses 1 through 14.

Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and  he led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horib, the mountain of God. There an angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that the bush was on fire and it did not burn up. So Moses thought, I will go over and see the strange sight why the bush does not burn  up. When the Lord saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush.

Moses, Moses, and Moses said, here I am. Do not come any closer, God said. Take off your sandals for the place where you are standing as holy ground. Then he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the  God of Jacob. At this Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at God.

The Lord said, I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers and I am concerned about their  suffering. So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and bring them up  out of that land into a good and spacious land. A land flowing with milk and honey, the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Parasites,  Hivites, and Jebysites. And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me and I have seen the way the Egyptians are  oppressing them.

So now go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt. But Moses said to God, who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out  of Egypt? And God said, I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you.

When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain. Moses said to God, suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, the God of your fathers has  sent me to you and they ask me, what is his name? Then what shall I tell them? God said to Moses, I am who I am. This is what you are to say to the Israelites.

I am has sent me to you. The word of the Lord, thanks be to God. Now, each week we are looking at the subject of how we can talk about our deepest faith  beliefs in public, how can we share who we are, our deep faith beliefs, but in such a  way that is respectful, promotes peace, and I have observed over the years that one  of the best ways of having a discussion about faith publicly is to not simply talk about  what you believe, but also how you came to believe it. Not just do the content, but the process or the journey that you went on, you know, it's  not just, here's what I believe, but how did you come to believe what you believe? How did you come to have faith in the God you have faith in?

It's a journey account, or some people would call it a personal testimony, and I think  it lowers the temperature, because when you're not just saying, here's what I believe,  no, here's what I believe, you're talking about the process and the experience by which  you came to your faith, I think it commands a certain respect, you know, you listen to  what person's account of their experience, I think it also very often is helpful because  everybody's on a process, and to hear how you went through your process is helpful. And so in order to help us think about how we can think about this, is we're looking  at this passage, which is very famous, Moses in the Burning Bush, there's an awful, Leo  and I were up here just talking about maybe some of you were on the generation, but it's  hard for me not to think of Charlton Heston, and Cecil B. DeMille's voice or whoever's  voice coming from the Burning Bush, I mean, it's a very famous, that was the movie Ten  Commandments, some of you movies you used to go and watch them on big screens and things  like that, I know it's sorry, it's kind of ancient history, but it's actually, this account  is here, and we're looking at it tonight because it's Moses' conversion experience. This is Moses' conversion experience. This is how he didn't just come to believe in God, he already believed in God.

In fact, when God speaks to him, he says, look, I'm the God of your father, the God of Abraham,  Isaac and Jacob, when he says that, he's saying, I'm the God you believe in, actually, I'm  the God of your father, the God of your father, he knows that Moses believes in this God,  he's never encountered him, he's never had a face-to-face experience with him, he hasn't  met him, and therefore it can be said that this is Moses' conversion experience, and so  if we see how he didn't come just to believe in God, but actually meet God, we're going  to see four things that brought him to that, and I think there's the same four things  that the Bible says you have to have usually happen in your life if you're going to meet  him as well. So, if Moses met him this way, we need these four things, usually, in order to actually  experience and meet God, what are those four things? They are a disrupting sight, an expanding concept, a personal problem, and a surprising  grace. Okay, so first, a disrupting sight. The first thing that brings Moses to actually meet God is the bush itself, verse two and  three.

Moses saw that though the bush was on fire, it did not burn up, so Moses thought, I will  go over and see this strange sight, why the bush is not consumed, does not burn up. Now, Moses probably originally saw a brush fire over here, some distance, but that wasn't  all that unusual, there's a lot of reasons why you can have brush fires in the desert,  but what caught his attention was this fire didn't go out, and as you can imagine, brush fires  are fast, why? Because there's no fuel out there, a bush, or some brush isn't much in the way of fuel,  so fires that do happen out there because of lightning or for other whatever reason, or  maybe some other shepherd who went by and left a campfire going. If you are going to have a brush fire, it goes out quickly, but evidently this bush kept  burning and burning and burning and burning, and we're told that Moses decided, I better  go see what this is, why? Because that doesn't make sense, it doesn't fit, that's impossible, a bush has to burn  out, I mean the fire consumes the bush and then it goes out, why is the bush continued  to burn, why is the fire continued to burn, and we're told he went over, see twice it  uses this word, I will go over and see this strange sight, verse 4, it says, the Lord  saw that he had gone over, that is a Hebrew word that means the detour, he let himself  be interrupted, his normal path was interrupted, okay, what's the first principle, here's the  first principle, ordinarily you don't meet God unless something comes into your life that  you can't account for and disrupts your life or disrupts your thinking, very often seriously  disrupts and interrupts you, what Moses saw the burning bush didn't fit his understanding  of what could happen, because it didn't fit, he went over to see it and figure it out  and consider it and so forth, and we usually do not come to faith in God, just simply by thinking  about it, we usually have to have something that comes into our life that disrupts us,  that we can't account for, and that makes us think in ways we didn't before.

Thomas Kuhn wrote a book in the mid 20th century called The Structure of Scientific Revolutions  which explains this, it's an academic book that you probably have not heard of and yet you  have probably because it was very famous, at least maybe not by name, Kuhn was writing  about how science works, the Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn tried, he was a philosopher  of science, historian of science, and he said, actually science does not move forward  the way you tend to say, scientists like to say, I'm objective and when I get a new bit  of data, I look at it, and if I follow the evidence wherever it leads and so I'm gradually  making small changes, I'm getting more evidence, I'm getting clear of you and I'm changing  my views in the court with the evidence, and Kuhn says now, that's not how it works. Kuhn says, we are very close minded, all of us, we are not open to new evidence and he says  all of us tend to have interpretive grids by which we interpret reality. Now a grid is what he called a paradigm, so yes, actually he, I think, popularized the term  paradigm, a paradigm is a way of looking at reality. And Kuhn says, we really have those views, these interpretive grids, these ways of looking  at reality, and when new evidence comes along we do everything we can to use that evidence  to confirm what we already believe. We do everything we can to work it in, now I'll tell you, one of the perfect, to me examples  of that was 9-11.

Here we all are all looking at the same horrible thing that happened, we're looking right  at it, there it is. But there were some people who had an interpretive grid that said, America is the bad guys  in the world. We're a force for materialism and abuse of power, whatever, we're the bad guys in the  world. And there was another people who said, America is the good guy, we're the force of good  on the side of good against evil. So once as America is a good guy, once as America is a bad guy, it's amazing, I read the essays  of people after 9-11, we were looking at the very same thing and everybody used it to  say, see, this is what I always said, this is what I always believed.

See 9-11, that proves that we're the bad guy, the world hates us. See 9-11, other people said, that proves that we're the good people and we have evil  on against us. We had two different groups of people with two different paradigms, they were totally  opposite to each other, they were looking at the same bit of data and using it to support  the paradigm. Thomas Koon says, we're not open-minded people, we have our set of beliefs and when a piece  of data comes, we use it to confirm what we already believe, except Koon says, sometimes  stuff comes into our lives that this rubs. Sometimes stuff comes into our lives that we can't really account for in the grid, it  doesn't really fit, it's difficult to work it in.

Koon's example, of course, the classic example was our Western understanding of the solar  system. Koon said, for years, people believed that the earth was fixed and the earth was in the  center and there were all these other bodies orbiting around it and of course that seemed  to explain. You looked up in the sky and you could see other bodies moving and we said, of course, they're  all orbiting around us and so every time you got a new bit of data, we found a new planet,  we found another, you know, the astronomers found another heavenly body, they said of course  that fits into the grid and then Koon says, what began to happen was some of the bodies  that we saw in space didn't seem to fit. Their movements didn't seem to work into this idea that everything was orbiting around  earth. Some of them kind of moved infinitely like zigzags in the sky and that didn't seem to  really work.

Koon says, what happens eventually is enough data comes in, you can't account for or something  comes in, you can't account for and it leads you to question the grid itself and you sit  there and say, oh, maybe I got it wrong and you try on, it's like trying on a dress,  you try on a new paradigm, you try something else on and you say, well, maybe the earth  is orbiting too. And when you try that paradigm on, suddenly it makes sense of all the data and you have  what he calls a paradigm shift, it's like a conversion, suddenly you realize if I change  the grid then suddenly I can explain everything else and you have this enormous shift so  he says basically because we're so close-minded, we do not move, we don't change our bodies  little by little, instead we try to work everything into confirm our existing paradigms  until something comes in a burning bush, something that doesn't fit, something you can't  account for, you try on a new way of thinking and it creates a shift, basically a kind  of conversion. Now, that's how it is with God, usually, usually something comes into your life, it's  a burning bush and you can't account for it. You've got to set a belief, either you don't believe in God or you believe whether  probably is a God but nobody knows, you either have an inconsequential God or you have  no God or something like that, a God that you don't need to know in order to live life  and then something comes into your life and you can't account for it. It could be a train of thought, we've talked about this in the last couple of weeks, you  know, WHO, who lived here in the Upper East Side in World War II, Great British Poet, didn't  believe in God, but World War II came, we talked about this at length in the last couple  of weeks.

World War II comes along, WHO sees the Nazis what they're doing and he says, wait a minute,  there's no God, what right do I have to say that my values are right and there's a wrong? If there's no God, what warrant do I have for saying I'm right and they're wrong? And so he's thought like this, if there's no God, all morality is relative but no, morality  is not relative, what they're doing is wrong and therefore there must be a God. The train of thought came along that didn't fit in to his grid and he had a paradigm shift. He had a change in it, he questioned the grid itself so it can be kind of an intellectual  burning bush, a train of thought, but very often it's something else.

Years ago when Redeemer got started and we had a few hundred people, you know, actually  in the early days, I mean the first couple of years, this body was about the size of  Redeemer, the whole of Redeemer. And we were, this is the late 80s, early 90s and we were just normal New Yorkers, we were  people who worked in Wall Street, worked in the arts, you know, worked in fashion, just  normal New Yorkers, but I used to find that if you brought a person in, the average man  had 99.9% of the average man had nights didn't believe in historic Christianity or anything  like that. But if they came in and they just sat down and they realized we all believed in historic  Christianity, they were here for about 10 or 15 minutes, they started having paradigm shifts. Redeemer itself was a burning bush, you know why? Because in their grid, people like them, people who'd gone to the same schools, people  who did the same jobs, people like them didn't believe in Christianity, see, it was just  not done, nobody did it except here's a few hundred people that were doing it.

So what are we going to do about that? And suddenly Redeemer itself sometimes was a burning bush, you could just see little  paradigm meltdowns, you know, it was coming out of their ears, you know, the paradigm,  the old paradigm, there was a shift going on, they couldn't quite account for people  that were, you know, we weren't brilliant, we're just normal, and normal people don't have  these beliefs, how could you believe that? Or sometimes a Christian comes into your life and maybe you're not a believer, and  the Christian is just so much more wise or so much more poised or so much more intelligent  and we're so much more thoughtful than you thought Christians could be and the Christian  itself is like a burning bush. We're very often, one more thing before going on, very often disillusioning and difficult  experiences, very often they're the burning bush. They come into your life and you're saying, look, I don't know if there's a God, there  might be, there might not, I don't need to know God, that's your grid, which means your  assumption is I can handle life, I can handle life, you know, I'm smart, I'm savvy,  you know, I've got, I've got a therapist, you know, I've got friends, you know, I'm  not stupid, you know, I know life isn't easy but I can handle life.

David Martin Lloyd-Jones was a physician, a young physician in Britain in the 1920s. He became a Christian, he got converted and went into the ministry after that, but he  tells about his conversion and a big part of it was this. He believed, well, a big part of it was this, a man that he admired, an older man who  was a physician and everything he wanted to be, you see, in that day and time, the best  physicians in Britain, they were heroes, they were emulated, they were, you know, they  were saving lives, they were respected, they were brilliant, they were, they were well paid,  they had enormous status and it was one of those men that Lloyd-Jones looked up to and  wanted to be like, he was dating a woman and she died, great tragedy. He came by to see Lloyd-Jones and he says, hey, it'd be okay if I stayed here for a little  bit and Lloyd-Jones says, oh, it's up to the fire and the man, Lloyd-Jones says, the man  pulled up a chair to the fire and sat down and stared at the fire for two hours, didn't  say a word. He also didn't act as if Lloyd-Jones was there.

Now, Lloyd-Jones did not have his feelings hurt and he didn't feel, in any way, that  was inappropriate. It was perfectly appropriate but when he saw one of the men, that he, a world-beater,  a person that he thought, that he wanted to be like and he realized this man was absolutely  out of resources. He had nothing left. He had nothing with which to actually face the normal realities of life. And Lloyd-Jones says, he looked at him staring at the fire and this is what he said.

He says, I suddenly saw the vanity of all human greatness. I suddenly saw the vanity of all human greatness. What was going on there? In that young man's mind, it was a burning bush. It was something that didn't fit.

He says, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, if a guy like this can't handle  life, how in the world do I think I can handle life without God? So, but here's the point. When these things come into your life and they start to challenge you and they start  to make you question the grid, are you willing to go over? Like Moses. You know, if Moses hadn't gone over, if he actually said, I don't want to be bothered,  he would have never heard of Moses.

See, once you get bothered, you have to be willing to think it out. You have to have the guts to think it out and be willing to think it out. We always say the gospel changes everything and we believe it really does. That's why here at Gospel and Life, August is Go and Share Month. Throughout August, we're inviting thousands of our listeners to take a small step in  sharing the gospel with someone God has placed in your life.

For those of you who make a gift to Gospel and Life this month, we'll send you two copies  of making sense of God by Tim Keller. It's a powerful resource that explores how Christianity makes emotional, cultural, and  rational sense in today's world. It's our thanks for your gift and provides a way you can do a small act to share the gospel  by reading the book with a friend, giving one to a coworker or passing on both copies  to people who are exploring the Christian faith. It's a simple way to start a gospel conversation or continue it. To request your two copies of making sense of God, simply go to gospelandlife.com-slash-give.

Again, that's gospelandlife.com-slash-give. Now, here's Dr. Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. Barbara Brown Taylor, in her famous sermon on the burning bush, says, imagine if Moses  had just hunched down over his shoulders and kept his head down and just stayed busy. What if Moses had said, burning bush?

I didn't really see it. I don't know what that is. Burning bush? Well, probably there's some rational explanation anyway. Burning bush.

I've been paid to watch sheep, not turn aside and look at bushes. Burning bush, would somebody please put that out? If he had done that, you never would have heard of him. He would never met God. God would never have spoken to him and the same thing would happen to you.

He got to turn aside, okay? So I disrupting sight. Second and third, they kind of go together. Second and third, if you're really going to meet God, secondly, you have to have an expanding  concept of God. Now, what do I mean by expanding concept?

Well, let's look at this idea of God revealing himself as fire. Why does God reveal himself as fire? One of the reasons is he's getting across one of the most mind-numbing, amazing things  that the Bible says about God. See, the reason Moses went to see the bush was bushes are usually dependent on the,  I mean, pardon me, fire is usually dependent on the bush. It's dependent on the bush for fuel.

And therefore, fires don't stay going forever because they have to have fuel. And after they consume the fuel, they're gone. Why? They're dependent on the fuel. But this fire wasn't dependent on the bush.

It wasn't dependent on anything. It had its own power of being within it, which of course was a miracle. But what is that symbolized? And symbolizes what God says about himself at the very end. When Moses says, well, who should I say has sent me to Israel?

What's your name in other words? And you know what God says? I'll tell you what my name is. He says, I am who I am. Tell them, I am has sent you.

Now it's actually really hard to translate this. What God really gives Moses, actually, as his name, is just the Hebrew verb to be. It's like he's almost saying, tell them being itself sent you. I am what I am, I am who I am, but basically being itself. And here's what he's saying.

I depend on nothing. Everything depends on me. I am self-sufficient. I have the power of all being in myself. I am the ground of all being.

You know, when the Bible says God has no ending, we can kind of imagine that, I guess. But when the Bible says God has no beginning, that's where my brain starts to melt. But it has to be, why? Because if something has a beginning, it's because something begins it. And if God had a beginning and something would have begun God, and whatever that something  was, God would have been dependent on, but God is saying, I am dependent on nothing.

All existence has its existence only in me. I'm at the heart of every molecule. I'm holding everything together. Hebrew is one one talks about that. In him, all things consist.

And so what God is trying to say here is that I am existence itself. I am being itself. I'm the ground of all being. I'm not just a being, I am being. I'm not just a being, I am being.

I am that I am. Jesus put it slightly more personal terms without him you can do nothing. Now here's what I'm trying to say at this point. We could talk a lot about this, and this is the name that God reveals here. But what I'm trying to show you is this, Moses is having an expanding understanding of  God.

He had a view of God, but what is this? In general, when people talk to me about not being able to believe in God. In general, I can ask them, well tell me what you don't believe in, and tell me why  it's hard to believe in God. And they always describe why I can't believe in a God who does this, I can't, and it's  I'd say four times out of five, after they tell me what they don't like about God and  why they can't believe in God. Four times out of five, I can say, oh, this is great.

I don't believe in that God either. The God you're talking about is not the God I believe in, they say what? That's always the God that people disbelieve in is a flat God, a reductionist to God, a reduced  God. Nothing like the multi-dimensional rich, rich God of the Bible. The Bible's talking about God is this, but he's also this, he's this, but he's also this,  and paradoxically he's this, and he's also this, and the simpler your understanding of God  is, the more rejectable it is.

And I'll go so far as to say, the richer and more nuanced your understanding of God,  the harder it is to reject him and the easier it is to believe in him. Certainly, the harder it is to just reject him out of hand. And what Moses was getting is an expanding understanding of God, and you will, if you're  expanding and you're understanding of God, and getting a richer understanding of God,  you're moving in the right direction. So he had a disrupting side, he had an expanding concept. Thirdly, there was a personal problem.

Now what do I mean by personal problem? Let's go back to the fire. There are a number of things that God was getting across with fire, and here's one of them. Fire is so beautiful and so scary at once. It is so brilliant and so attractive and so dangerous and so frightening at once.

Look. Moses said, here I am, verse 5, do not come any closer, God said, take off your sandals  for the place where you were standing is holy ground. At this Moses hit his face because he was afraid to look at God. Now Alec Matier, great Old Testament Bible scholar, says about this verse, that the holiness  of God is that part of God's nature that is dangerous for sinners like you and me. The holiness of God is that part of God's nature that is dangerous to sinners like  you and me.

And only we hear that, we New Yorkers say, I want a loving God, what do you mean? Dangerous? Dangerous? He's like fire. He's beautiful, but he's dangerous.

I don't think I like that, but actually, please think with me a little bit. Why is God dangerous? Why is the holiness of God his terrifying danger? Well, first two reasons. The holiness of God, first of all, means he exposes us through his perfection.

Come on, you know what this word, how this works. Whenever you're in the presence of absolute, incredible talent or beauty or brilliance,  when you're in the presence of a human being with excellence, it's just like fire. Why? It's wonderful and it's horrible. Look, you may think of yourself as not too bad looking person, then there's some people  you don't want to stand near them because you don't want people looking from you to him  or to her.

You don't want that. You know, you feel like I'm not so bad looking and then you get near somebody who makes  you ten times better looking and then you feel homely ugly. You may think of yourself as talented, you know, this is one of the true story, of course,  is that it happens very often. You may be the best violinist in hot coffee, Texas, little town, you know, and you get  off the train in New York City and there's somebody begging, you know, and grand social  station, you know, with a violin case open and people throw money in, they're playing  and they're way better than you. And you go, oh no, what's happening?

It's beautiful. I mean, violinist is beautiful. You say, well, that's beautiful, the technique, but you're scared to death. Whenever you get into the presence of something way better than you, it's horrible and wonderful. Well, how would that be true of God?

Of course it is. And this is one of the ways you know you're drawing near to the real God. When Isaiah went in to see the Holy One, high and lifted up, holy, holy, holy, he heard  the angel saying, he went into the temple and he saw the holiness of God and you've got  a figure. Isaiah, he's a prophet. Isaiah, compared to the most of the population, he would have to be more virtuous, more spiritual,  more moral, a better person than most, but what does he say about himself?

Unclean, he calls himself. Everything that Isaiah was proud of looked like trash. Because in the presence of power, you feel your weakness in the presence of beauty, you feel  your ugliness in the presence of light, you feel your darkness. And therefore God's dangerous because he is so holy and so perfect and so beautiful  that he's horrible. Because when you get near him, you have a self-quake, your self-image falls apart.

All the things you tell yourself, I'm not that bad a person, it's not true. It's just not true and you realize it's not true. All your self-justifications, all your little self-deceptions, the blindness we all have. Everybody knows that. We always sort of, that person is awful, that person is awful, but me, you have to understand.

You're always making excuses for yourself, but in the presence of God, it's incredibly traumatic. It's like a logically absolutely devastating. It's incredibly dangerous because God is so beautiful, He is dangerous. He shows you who you are. So His perfection exposes you, but also He is a God of active goodness.

The difference between active and passive goodness, there's been a lot of studies  that during the Holocaust in Germany, most Germans felt bad about the fact that the Jews  were disappearing. They justified it. They told themselves, well, they're just going to detention camps, I mean, they always,  they lied to themselves so they didn't want to admit, but basically, most Germans saw  the Jews just disappearing. They saw the Jewish neighbors just disappearing and they felt bad about it. Why?

People, but they're passively good. They didn't say anything. They didn't make waves. They were afraid to. As we all know, passive goodness isn't as good as active goodness and God is actively  good.

God is not just good in general. He doesn't tolerate evil, He doesn't tolerate evil in sin in you. And as a result, there's a danger. Now here's the third point, very important. If you're going to have an experience of God and counter God, it really ought to be a real God.

We are so affected by consumer capitalism and in consumer capitalism, we choose everything. We get what we want. Everything's customized to us. And so you don't you see what we tend to do? I do it.

Can't you do it? You get the God you want. You say, I don't like to believe in God like this. I like to believe in God like this. I hear people say this.

I like to think of God like this. I like to think of God like this. If you're creating your own God, it's just an extension of you. How's that guy going to be of any help to you? How's that guy going to give you any power?

It's just you. How's that guy going to be any resource? It's just you. If you're actually just creating God you like. So how are you going to be sure that you're drawing near to a real God, a real spiritual reality,  a true God, a living God?

How are you going to know that? And Jonathan Edwards, the great 18th century theologian philosopher says that most of the  attributes of God are attributes that we would choose if we were creating a God. You know, it'd be nice to have a powerful God because then if he's your God, then he  can help you. It'd be nice to have a merciful God, then if you're guilty he can forgive you. Almost all the attributes are attributes that we would choose, but there's one attribute  we would never choose, Edwards says, it's the holiness of God because it's just a problem.

The holiness is nothing but a problem, a big problem for us and if you are starting to  sense that this God that you're trying to come to grips with is holy and that you're  not just a good person who needs a spiritual boost from him and you're not just even a  needy person who needs fulfillment but that you're a sinner and you need forgiveness  and pardon. And you begin to actually sense that there's a problem and you've got a problem coming  into his presence. Now you have some confidence that you're not making this God up. Now you've got some confidence that you're on your way toward the real God because you  sense that you've got a personal problem, he's not just an abstraction, he's just trying  to believe in him but you've got a problem in relating to him and that brings us naturally  then the last thing you need would be you need some kind of grace, you need something  that will enable you to stand in God's presence. Moses is wondering about that.

Down here in verse 11 and 12, Moses says, but who am I that you would send me to Pharaoh  and then God says, I will be with you but if you go on in the text, you'll see Moses  is not modified here. Moses says, wait a minute, you're holy. He's starting to see who he is, what he's like and he begins to say, how in the world  am I? Well put it like this, the bush is not consumed but why isn't Moses? In Exodus 33, Moses actually asked God, can I see you face to face and God says no, you  can't, it will kill you.

Well then why is it not consumed right here? The bush isn't consumed, okay, it was a miracle but why isn't Moses consumed and the secret  and the answer, it's in the text but you probably went right by it, I do. Look all through here, it says God spoke to Moses out of the bush. God spoke to Moses out of the bush, God spoke to Moses out of the bush but who's actually  in the bush? It tells you in verse 2, the angel of the Lord.

Wait a minute you say that's weird, it says the angel was in the bush but then all the  way through the rest of the text it talks as if God's in the bush, yes, that's the way  it works in the Old Testament. There's this figure, this enigmatic figure named the angel of the Lord, not an angel of  the Lord, like Gabriel or somebody like that, the angel of the Lord and when the angel of  the Lord shows up, it's weird because on the one hand this angel of the Lord seems to be  a distinct person from God, on the other hand the angel of the Lord seems to be God. Like it'll say the angel of the Lord spoke to Abraham or the angel of the Lord spoke  to Moses but then the very next verse it'll say and God said to Moses and God said  Abraham, it's almost as if this person is both God and not God. But here's what's all so interesting, Alec Matier says, if you look carefully, the angel  of the Lord shows up when God wants to draw near to someone without destroying them. One of the most interesting spots is later on in the book of Exodus, Matier says there's  this argument going back and forth between Moses and God and Moses says, Lord, you must  your presence must go with us as the children of Israel leave Egypt and go toward the promised  line.

Your presence must go with us and God says no. My presence cannot go with you because you are rebellious people and my presence will  destroy you. And then Moses pushes back and says no, no, I'm not going to go unless you go with us and  then finally God says, Matier points this out in his commentary on Exodus. He finally says, wait, okay, I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'll send my angel with you.

And here's what Matier says about that. Moses says, I want your presence. God says no, it'll destroy you. Most I want your presence. Okay, I'll send you my angel.

And here's what Matier says in his commentary. He says the angel of the Lord is revealed as the merciful accommodation of God whereby  the Lord can be present among a sinful people when were he to go with them himself. God's presence would consume them. So the angel is that mode of deity whereby the holy God can keep company with sinners  without destroying them. And then Matier goes on and says, who would that be?

He says there is only one other in the Bible who is both identical with and yet distinct  from the Lord. One who while affirming the wrath of God is yet a supreme display of his mercy. The angel of the Lord can only be understood as a pre-incarnate appearance of Jesus Christ. And do you remember in John chapter 8, Jesus says to his listeners, before Abraham was  I am. He doesn't say before Abraham was I was.

That would have been weird enough. But he says before Abraham was I am. And what is he saying? He's saying, I'm the one who spoke to Moses from the bush. And now here's the secret.

Here's the answer to all the riddles. You say, well, how is Jesus Christ the angel of the Lord? How is Jesus Christ the way that we can be in the presence of God without being consumed? Oh my goodness, here it is. Here's how you can finally see the fire of God.

Fire is terrible and beautiful. And on the cross you see how terribly holy God is. He is so terribly holy that Jesus Christ had to die. God is actively good. God has to meet out punishment on sin.

Just can't be shrugged at. He is so terribly holy, Jesus had to die, but he is so beautifully loving, so beautifully  loving that in Jesus Christ he was willing to come and glad to die, willing to die, make  his own atonement. And there it is. We have hymns about this. One hymn goes, before the throne absolved we stand, thy love has met, thy laws demand.

Terrible, horrible, beautiful, gorgeous, and if you want to know the ravishing beauty of  this fiery God, a God who wants so holy that you got a problem with him and yet so loving  that he solved the problem at his own expense. If you say, I want to know that God, you will come to know that God, why? Because that's the God who reveals himself to Moses in the bush and that's the God who  reveals himself to people. And guess what will happen if you do that? If you believe in Jesus Christ, you will become a burning bush.

Moses did. Moses went out and changed the world. Why? Because the glory and the beauty of God came into his life. In fact, at one point he had to put a veil over his face and it didn't consume him.

Why? Well, he wasn't really sure. He just knew that somehow atonement had been made, but you and I know. Peter 1, verse 3 says, the Christians have been made partakers of the divine nature. Ephesians 2 says, we're temples of the Holy Spirit, the light and the uncommon light and  the beauty and the glory of God can come into your life and yet you not be consumed because  of the merits and mediation of Jesus Christ and then you become a little burning bush.

And you become someone who can, who people go over to see, to figure out because you're  inexplicable. When you become someone who can touch others or have God touch others through you and  you can change the world, do you believe in the God who revealed Himself to Moses and  the burning bush with us pray? Father, we thank you for giving us this pathway to experience of you and we ask that you  would help us now even as we participate in the Lord's Supper to know you. That is an abstract God but is a fiery loving God. We pray that you would help every Christian here experience your reality and everyone  here who is not yet know you also come to experience that reality we ask it in Jesus'  name.

欢迎来到《生命中的福音》。当谈到公开表达你的信仰时，你感到有多自在？本月在播客中，提姆·凯勒探讨圣经关于公开信仰的教导。他向我们展示了在多元社会中公开表达我们的信仰是什么样子，以一种创造文明、和平以及与邻居之间有意义对话的方式。今晚的经文来自《出埃及记》第3章第1至14节。

摩西牧养他岳父米甸祭司叶忒罗的羊群，一日领羊群往野外去，到了神的山，就是何烈山。耶和华的使者从荆棘里火焰中向摩西显现。摩西观看，不料，荆棘被火烧着，却没有烧毁。摩西说，我要过去看这大异象，这荆棘为何没有烧坏呢？耶和华神见他过去要看，就从荆棘里呼叫说：

摩西，摩西。他说，我在这里。神说，不要近前来。当把你脚上的鞋脱下来，因为你所站之地是圣地。又说，我是你父亲的神，是亚伯拉罕的神，以撒的神，雅各的神。摩西蒙上脸，因为怕看神。

耶和华说，我的百姓在埃及所受的困苦，我实在看见了；他们因受督工的辖制所发的哀声，我也听见了。我原知道他们的痛苦。我下来是要救他们脱离埃及人的手，领他们出了那地，到美好宽阔、流奶与蜜之地，就是到迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人之地。现在以色列人的哀声达到我耳中，我也看见埃及人怎样欺压他们。

故此我要打发你去见法老，使你可以将我的百姓以色列人从埃及领出来。摩西对神说，我是什么人，竟能去见法老，将以色列人从埃及领出来呢？神说，我必与你同在。你将百姓从埃及领出来之后，你们必在这山上事奉神，这就是我打发你去的证据。

摩西对神说，我到以色列人那里，对他们说，你们祖宗的神打发我到你们这里来。他们若问我说，他叫什么名字？我要对他们说什么呢？神对摩西说，我是自有永有的。又说，你要对以色列人这样说，那自有的打发我到你们这里来。这是耶和华的话，感谢神。

现在，我们每周都在探讨一个主题，就是我们如何能在公开场合谈论我们最深层的信仰信念，我们如何能分享我们是谁，我们深层的信仰信念，但以一种尊重的方式，促进和平。我多年来观察到，在公开场合讨论信仰的最好方式之一，不仅仅是谈论你相信什么，还要谈论你是如何相信的。不仅仅是内容，还有过程或你所经历的旅程。你知道，这不仅仅是，这是我所相信的，而是你是如何相信你所相信的？你是如何对你所信仰的神产生信心的？

这是一个旅程叙述，或者有些人会称之为个人见证，我认为这会降低温度，因为当你不仅仅是在说，这是我所相信的，不，这是我所相信的，你是在谈论你形成信仰的过程和经历，我认为这会赢得某种尊重，你知道，你倾听一个人对他们经历的叙述，我认为这通常也很有帮助，因为每个人都在一个过程中，听你如何经历你的过程是有帮助的。为了帮助我们思考如何思考这个问题，我们正在看这段经文，这是非常著名的，摩西与燃烧的荆棘。利昂和我刚才在这里谈论，也许你们中的一些人是那一代，但我很难不想到查尔顿·赫斯顿，以及西塞尔·B·德米尔的声音或是谁的声音从燃烧的荆棘中发出。我的意思是，这是非常著名的，那是电影《十诫》，你们中的一些人过去常常去大银幕上看电影之类的，我知道这有点像古代历史了，抱歉。但实际上，这段记载在这里，我们今晚看它是因为这是摩西的归信经历。这是摩西的归信经历。这就是他不仅相信神，他已经相信神了。

事实上，当神对他说话时，他说，看，我是你父亲的神，亚伯拉罕、以撒和雅各的神。当他说这话时，他是在说，我是你所相信的神。实际上，我是你父亲的神，你父亲的神，他知道摩西相信这位神，他从未遇见过他，他从未面对面地与他接触过，他没有遇见他，因此可以说这是摩西的归信经历。所以如果我们看到他不仅仅是相信神，而是真正遇见神，我们将看到四件事带他到达那里，我认为圣经说如果你要遇见他，你的生命中通常也必须发生同样的四件事。所以，如果摩西以这种方式遇见他，我们需要这四件事，通常，才能真正经历并遇见神。那是哪四件事呢？它们是一个打断的景象、一个扩展的概念、一个个人问题和一个令人惊讶的恩典。好的，首先，一个打断的景象。第一件带摩西真正遇见神的事是荆棘本身，第2和第3节。

摩西看见荆棘被火烧着，却没有烧毁，摩西说，我要过去看这大异象，为何荆棘没有被烧毁。现在，摩西最初可能在这边看到了一场灌木丛火灾，有一定距离，但那并不是很不寻常，沙漠中有很多原因可能导致灌木丛火灾。但引起他注意的是这火没有熄灭，正如你可以想象的，灌木丛火灾很快，为什么？因为那里没有燃料，一丛灌木，或一些灌木丛在燃料方面并不多，所以那里发生的火灾，因为闪电或其他什么原因，或者也许是其他路过的牧羊人留下了篝火在燃烧。如果你要有一场灌木丛火灾，它很快就会熄灭，但显然这丛荆棘不断地燃烧，燃烧，燃烧，燃烧，我们被告知摩西决定，我最好去看看这是什么，为什么？因为那没有道理，不合理，那是不可能的，一丛荆棘必须烧完，我的意思是火消耗了荆棘，然后它就熄灭了，为什么荆棘继续燃烧，为什么火继续燃烧，我们被告知他过去了。看，它两次使用这个词，我要过去看这大异象，第4节说，耶和华见他过去要看。那是一个希伯来词，意思是绕道，他让自己被打断了，他的正常路径被打断了。好的，第一个原则是什么？这是第一个原则：通常你不会遇见神，除非有什么事情进入你的生活，是你无法解释的，并且打断了你的生活或打断了你的思考，非常经常是严重地打断和中断你。摩西所看到的燃烧的荆棘不符合他对可能发生的事情的理解，因为它不符合，他过去去看它，弄清楚它，考虑它等等。我们通常不会仅仅通过思考就对神产生信心，我们通常必须有某些事情进入我们的生活，打断我们，我们无法解释，并使我们以以前没有的方式思考。

托马斯·库恩在20世纪中叶写了一本书叫《科学革命的结构》，解释了这一点。这是一本学术书籍，你可能没有听说过，但你可能听说过，因为它非常有名，至少也许不是名字。库恩在写关于科学如何运作的，《科学革命的结构》。库恩试图，他是科学哲学家，科学史学家，他说，实际上科学不像你倾向于说的那样向前发展。科学家喜欢说，我是客观的，当我得到新的数据时，我看着它，如果我追随证据走向何方，所以我逐渐做出小的改变，我得到更多的证据，我对你越来越清楚，我根据证据改变我的观点。库恩说不，那不是它的运作方式。库恩说，我们都非常封闭，我们所有人，我们不对新证据开放。他说我们所有人都倾向于有解释性网格，通过它我们解释现实。现在网格就是他所说的范式，所以是的，实际上他，我想，普及了"范式"这个词。范式是一种看待现实的方式。库恩说，我们真的有这些观点，这些解释性网格，这些看待现实的方式，当新证据出现时，我们尽一切可能使用那些证据来确认我们已经相信的。我们尽一切可能把它纳入进来。现在我告诉你，对我来说，一个完美的例子是9-11。

我们所有人都在看同样的可怕事情发生，我们正看着它，就在那里。但有些人有一个解释性网格，说美国是世界上的坏人。我们是物质主义和滥用权力的力量，无论如何，我们是世界上的坏人。还有另一些人说，美国是好人，我们是善的力量，站在善的一边对抗邪恶。所以一旦美国是好人，一旦美国是坏人，令人惊讶的是，我读了人们在9-11之后的文章，我们看着完全相同的事情，每个人都用它来说，看，这就是我一直说的，这就是我一直相信的。

看9-11，那证明了我们是坏人，世界恨我们。看9-11，其他人说，那证明了我们是好人，我们有邪恶与我们对抗。我们有两组不同的人，有两种不同的范式，它们彼此完全相反，他们看着同样的数据，用它来支持范式。托马斯·库恩说，我们不是思想开放的人，我们有我们的一套信念，当一段数据出现时，我们用它来确认我们已经相信的，除了库恩说，有时候东西进入我们的生活，这擦。有时候东西进入我们的生活，我们真的无法在网格中解释，它真的不合适，很难把它纳入进来。

库恩的例子，当然，经典例子是我们西方对太阳系的理解。库恩说，多年来，人们相信地球是固定的，地球在中心，所有这些其他天体围绕它运行，当然那似乎解释了。你抬头看天空，你可以看到其他天体在移动，我们说，当然，它们都在围绕我们运行，所以每次你得到新的数据，我们发现了一颗新的行星，我们发现了另一个，你知道，天文学家发现了另一个天体，他们说当然那符合网格。然后库恩说，开始发生的是我们在太空中看到的一些天体似乎不合适。它们的运动似乎不符合这个想法，即一切都在围绕地球运行。它们中的一些在天空中像之字形移动，这似乎真的不起作用。

库恩说，最终发生的是足够的数据进来，你无法解释，或者有什么东西进来，你无法解释，它导致你质疑网格本身，你坐在那里说，哦，也许我错了。你试穿，就像试穿一件衣服，你试穿一个新范式，你试穿别的东西，你说，好吧，也许地球也在运行。当你试穿那个范式时，突然它解释了所有的数据，你有了他所说的范式转换。这就像一次归信，突然你意识到如果我改变网格，那么突然我可以解释其他一切，你有这个巨大的转变。所以他说基本上因为我们如此封闭，我们不移动，我们不一点一点地改变我们的身体，相反，我们试图把一切都纳入以确认我们现有的范式，直到有东西进来，一丛燃烧的荆棘，某些不合适的东西，你无法解释的东西，你试穿一种新的思考方式，它创造了一个转变，基本上是一种归信。现在，这就是神的情况，通常，通常有什么东西进入你的生活，它是一丛燃烧的荆棘，你无法解释它。你有一套信念，要么你不相信神，要么你相信可能有一位神，但没有人知道，你要么有一位无关紧要的神，要么你没有神，或者类似的东西，一位你不需要认识就能生活的神。然后有什么东西进入你的生活，你无法解释它。这可能是一连串的思考，我们在过去几周谈论过这个，你知道，W.H.奥登，在二战期间住在上东区，伟大的英国诗人，不相信神，但二战来了，我们在过去几周详细谈论了这个。

二战来了，奥登看到纳粹人所做的事，他说，等一下，没有神，我有什么权利说我的价值观是对的，有错的？如果没有神，我有什么根据说我是对的，他们是错的？所以他这样想，如果没有神，所有道德都是相对的，但不，道德不是相对的，他们所做的是错的，因此必定有一位神。这一连串的思考出现了，不符合他的网格，他有了一次范式转换。他有了一个改变，他质疑了网格本身，所以这可能是一种智力上的燃烧荆棘，一连串的思考，但通常是其他东西。

多年前，当救赎主教会开始时，我们有几百人，你知道，实际上在早期，我是说最初几年，这个群体大约是救赎主教会的规模，整个救赎主教会。这是80年代末、90年代初，我们只是普通的纽约人，我们是在华尔街工作的人，在艺术界工作，你知道，在时尚界工作，只是普通的纽约人。但我过去常常发现，如果你带一个人进来，普通男人99.9%的普通男人晚上不相信历史性基督教或类似的东西。但如果他们进来，他们只是坐下来，他们意识到我们都相信历史性基督教，他们在那里大约10或15分钟，他们开始有范式转换。救赎主教会本身就是一丛燃烧的荆棘，你知道为什么吗？因为在他们的网格中，像他们这样的人，去过同样学校的人，做同样工作的人，像他们这样的人不相信基督教，看，这只是不做，没有人做，除了这里有几百人在做。

那么我们要怎么办呢？突然救赎主教会本身有时就是一丛燃烧的荆棘，你可以看到小的范式崩溃，你知道，从他们的耳朵里冒出来，你知道，范式，旧范式，正在发生转变，他们无法完全解释那些人，你知道，我们并不聪明，我们只是普通人，普通人没有这些信念，你怎么能相信那个？或者有时一个基督徒进入你的生活，也许你不是信徒，那个基督徒比你想象的基督徒可以是的要聪明得多，或者要沉着得多，或者要有智慧得多，或者要有思想得多，那个基督徒本身就像一丛燃烧的荆棘。我们非常经常，再说一件事再继续，非常经常令人失望和困难的经历，非常经常它们是燃烧的荆棘。它们进入你的生活，你在说，看，我不知道有没有神，可能有，可能没有，我不需要认识神，那是你的网格，这意味着你的假设是我能处理生活，我能处理生活，你知道，我很聪明，我很精明，你知道，我有，我有一个治疗师，你知道，我有朋友，你知道，我不笨，你知道，我知道生活不容易，但我能处理生活。

戴维·马丁·劳埃德-琼斯是一位医生，1920年代在英国的年轻医生。他成为了基督徒，他归信了，之后进入了事工，但他讲述了他的归信，其中很大一部分是这样的。他相信，好吧，其中很大一部分是这样的，一个他钦佩的男人，一个年长的男人，他是医生，是他想成为的一切，你看，在那个时代，英国最好的医生，他们是英雄，他们受到仿效，他们受到，你知道，他们拯救生命，他们受到尊重,他们很聪明,他们受到,他们薪水很高,他们有巨大的地位,就是这些人之一,劳埃德-琼斯仰慕并想成为像他那样的人,他在约会一个女人,她死了,巨大的悲剧。他来看劳埃德-琼斯,他说,嘿,如果我在这里待一会儿可以吗？劳埃德-琼斯说,哦,到火炉边去。那个男人,劳埃德-琼斯说,那个男人把椅子拉到火炉边坐下,盯着火看了两个小时,一句话也没说。他也没有表现得好像劳埃德-琼斯在那里。

现在,劳埃德-琼斯没有感到他的感情受到伤害,他也不觉得,以任何方式,那是不恰当的。那是完全恰当的,但当他看到他钦佩的人之一,一个世界级人物,一个他想成为像他那样的人,他意识到这个人完全没有资源了。他什么都没有剩下。他没有什么可以真正面对生活的正常现实。劳埃德-琼斯说,他看着他盯着火,这是他说的。

他说,我突然看到了所有人类伟大的虚荣。我突然看到了所有人类伟大的虚荣。那里发生了什么？在那个年轻人的心中,这是一丛燃烧的荆棘。这是某些不符合的东西。

他说,等一下,等一下,等一下,如果一个像这样的人都不能处理生活,我怎么能认为我能在没有神的情况下处理生活？所以,但这是重点。当这些事情进入你的生活,它们开始挑战你,它们开始让你质疑网格,你愿意过去吗？像摩西一样。你知道,如果摩西没有过去,如果他实际上说,我不想被打扰,你就永远不会听说摩西了。

看,一旦你被打扰了,你必须愿意想清楚。你必须有勇气想清楚,愿意想清楚。我们总是说福音改变一切,我们真的相信它确实如此。这就是为什么在这里的《生命中的福音》,八月是"去分享月"。在整个八月,我们邀请我们数千名听众在与神放在你生活中的某人分享福音方面迈出一小步。

对于那些在本月向《生命中的福音》捐赠的人,我们将寄给你两本提姆·凯勒的《神合乎情理》。这是一个强大的资源,探讨基督教如何在当今世界中在情感上、文化上和理性上合乎情理。这是对你捐赠的感谢,并提供了一种你可以做一个小行动来分享福音的方式,通过与朋友一起阅读这本书,送给同事一本,或者把两本都传递给正在探索基督教信仰的人。这是一种简单的方式来开始或继续福音对话。要索取你的两本《神合乎情理》,只需访问gospelandlife.com斜杠give。

再次强调,那是gospelandlife.com斜杠give。现在,这是凯勒博士今天教导的剩余部分。芭芭拉·布朗·泰勒在她关于燃烧荆棘的著名讲道中说,想象一下如果摩西只是耸耸肩,低着头,继续忙碌。如果摩西说,燃烧的荆棘？

我没真的看到它。我不知道那是什么。燃烧的荆棘？好吧,可能有某种理性的解释。燃烧的荆棘。

我被雇来看羊,不是转过身去看荆棘。燃烧的荆棘,有人能把它扑灭吗？如果他那样做了,你就永远不会听说他了。他就永远不会遇见神。神就永远不会对他说话,同样的事情也会发生在你身上。

他必须转过身去,好吗？所以我打断的景象。第二和第三,它们有点一起。第二和第三,如果你真的要遇见神,第二,你必须有一个扩展的神的概念。现在,我所说的扩展概念是什么意思？

好吧,让我们看看神以火显现自己的这个想法。为什么神以火显现自己？原因之一是他正在传达圣经关于神所说的最令人震惊、惊人的事情之一。看,摩西去看荆棘的原因是荆棘通常依赖于，我的意思是,抱歉,火通常依赖于荆棘。它依赖于荆棘作为燃料。

因此,火不会永远持续,因为它们必须有燃料。在它们消耗燃料之后,它们就消失了。为什么？它们依赖于燃料。但这火不依赖于荆棘。

它不依赖于任何东西。它在自己里面有自己的存在能力,这当然是一个奇迹。但那象征什么？象征神在最后对自己所说的。当摩西说,好吧,我应该对以色列说谁派我来？

换句话说,你的名字是什么？你知道神说什么吗？我告诉你我的名字是什么。他说,我是自有永有的。告诉他们,自有的派你来了。

现在实际上很难翻译这个。神真正给摩西的,实际上,作为他的名字,只是希伯来语的动词"是"。就好像他几乎在说,告诉他们存在本身派你来了。我是我所是的,我是自有永有的,但基本上是存在本身。这是他在说的。

我不依赖于任何东西。一切都依赖于我。我是自给自足的。我拥有所有存在的能力在我自己里面。我是所有存在的根基。

你知道,当圣经说神没有结束时,我想我们可以想象那个。但当圣经说神没有开始时,那就是我的大脑开始融化的地方。但它必须是,为什么？因为如果某物有开始,那是因为某物开始了它。如果神有开始,某物就会开始了神,无论那某物是什么,神就会依赖于它,但神在说,我不依赖于任何东西。

所有存在只在我里面有其存在。我在每个分子的核心。我把一切都维系在一起。希伯来书一章谈到这个。万有都是靠他而立的。

所以神在这里试图说的是,我是存在本身。我是存在本身。我是所有存在的根基。我不仅仅是一个存在者,我是存在。我不仅仅是一个存在者,我是存在。

我是自有永有的。耶稣用稍微更个人化的术语表达,离了他你不能做什么。现在这是我在这一点上试图说的。我们可以谈很多关于这个,这是神在这里启示的名字。但我试图向你展示的是,摩西正在拥有一个扩展的对神的理解。

他对神有一个看法,但这是什么？一般来说,当人们跟我谈论不能相信神时。一般来说,我可以问他们,好吧,告诉我你不相信什么,告诉我为什么很难相信神。他们总是描述为什么我不能相信一个做这个的神,我不能,而且五次中有四次,在他们告诉我他们不喜欢神什么以及为什么他们不能相信神之后。五次中有四次,我可以说,哦,这太好了。

我也不相信那个神。你所说的神不是我所相信的神,他们说什么？人们总是不相信的神是一个平面的神,一个简化论的神,一个简化的神。完全不像圣经中多维度丰富、丰富的神。圣经谈论神是这样的,但他也是这样的,他是这样的,但他也是这样的,矛盾的是他是这样的,他也是这样的,你对神的理解越简单,它就越可拒绝。

我会说得更进一步,你对神的理解越丰富和细腻,就越难拒绝他,越容易相信他。当然,越难只是完全拒绝他。摩西得到的是一个对神扩展的理解,你会,如果你正在扩展和理解神,并得到一个对神更丰富的理解,你正在朝正确的方向前进。所以他有一个打断的景象,他有一个扩展的概念。第三,有一个个人问题。

现在我所说的个人问题是什么意思？让我们回到火。神通过火传达了许多事情,这是其中之一。火既美丽又可怕。它既如此辉煌、如此吸引人,又如此危险、如此令人恐惧。

看。摩西说,我在这里,第5节,不要近前来,神说,当把你脚上的鞋脱下来,因为你所站之地是圣地。摩西蒙上脸,因为他怕看神。现在亚历克·莫提尔,伟大的旧约圣经学者,关于这节经文说,神的圣洁是神本性中对像你我这样的罪人来说危险的那部分。神的圣洁是神本性中对像你我这样的罪人来说危险的那部分。

只有我们听到这个,我们纽约人说,我想要一个慈爱的神,你是什么意思？危险？危险？他就像火。他美丽,但他危险。

我不认为我喜欢那个,但实际上,请跟我想一想。为什么神是危险的？为什么神的圣洁是他可怕的危险？嗯,首先两个原因。神的圣洁,首先,意味着他通过他的完美暴露我们。

来吧,你知道这个词,这是如何运作的。每当你在绝对的、令人难以置信的才华、美丽或智慧的面前,当你在拥有卓越的人面前,就像火一样。为什么？既美妙又可怕。看,你可能认为自己是个外表不错的人,然后有些人你不想站在他们附近,因为你不想让人们从你看到他或她。

你不想那样。你知道,你觉得我长得不算难看,然后你靠近某个让你看起来丑十倍的人,然后你感到丑陋。你可能认为自己有才华,你知道,这当然是真实的故事,这经常发生。你可能是德克萨斯州Hot Coffee小镇上最好的小提琴手,你知道,然后你在纽约市下火车,有人在乞讨,你知道,在中央车站,你知道,小提琴盒打开,人们往里面扔钱,他们在演奏,他们比你好得多。你说,哦不,发生了什么？

这很美。我的意思是,小提琴手很美。你说,好吧,这很美,技术,但你吓坏了。每当你进入比你好得多的东西的面前,既可怕又美妙。那么这对神来说怎么会是真的呢？

当然是这样的。这是你知道你正在接近真神的方式之一。当以赛亚进去看至圣者,高高在上,圣哉,圣哉,圣哉,他听到天使在说,他进入圣殿,他看到神的圣洁,你必须弄清楚。以赛亚,他是先知。以赛亚,与大多数人相比,他必须更有道德、更属灵、更有道德、比大多数人更好,但他对自己说什么？

不洁,他称自己。以赛亚引以为豪的一切看起来都像垃圾。因为在能力的面前,你感到你的软弱,在美的面前,你感到你的丑陋,在光的面前,你感到你的黑暗。因此神是危险的,因为他如此圣洁、如此完美、如此美丽,以至于他是可怕的。因为当你靠近他时,你有一场自我地震,你的自我形象崩溃了。

所有你告诉自己的事情,我不是一个那么坏的人,那不是真的。这不是真的,你意识到那不是真的。你所有的自我辩护,你所有的小自我欺骗,我们都有的盲目性。每个人都知道那个。我们总是有点,那个人很糟糕,那个人很糟糕,但我,你必须理解。

你总是为自己找借口,但在神的面前,这是令人难以置信的创伤。就像逻辑上绝对毁灭性的。这是令人难以置信的危险,因为神如此美丽,他是危险的。他向你展示你是谁。所以他的完美暴露你,但他也是一位积极良善的神。

积极和消极良善之间的区别,有很多研究表明,在德国大屠杀期间,大多数德国人对犹太人正在消失的事实感到难过。他们为此辩护。他们告诉自己,好吧,他们只是去拘留营,我的意思是,他们总是,他们对自己撒谎,所以他们不想承认,但基本上,大多数德国人看到犹太人只是在消失。他们看到犹太邻居只是在消失,他们对此感到难过。为什么？

人们,但他们是消极地良善。他们什么也没说。他们没有兴风作浪。他们害怕。正如我们都知道的,消极的良善不如积极的良善,而神是积极地良善。

神不仅仅是一般性地良善。他不容忍邪恶,他不容忍你里面的邪恶和罪。结果,有一种危险。现在这是第三点,非常重要。如果你要有一次神的经历,遇见神,它真的应该是一位真神。

我们如此受消费资本主义的影响,在消费资本主义中,我们选择一切。我们得到我们想要的。一切都为我们定制。所以你没看到我们倾向于做什么吗？我做这个。

你不能做吗？你得到你想要的神。你说,我不喜欢相信这样的神。我喜欢相信这样的神。我听到人们这样说。

我喜欢这样想神。我喜欢这样想神。如果你正在创造你自己的神,它只是你的延伸。那个人怎么能帮助你呢？那个人怎么能给你任何力量？

这只是你。那个人怎么能成为任何资源？这只是你。如果你实际上只是在创造你喜欢的神。那么你怎么能确定你正在接近一位真神,一个真实的属灵实在,一位真神,一位活神？

你怎么知道那个？乔纳森·爱德华兹,18世纪伟大的神学家哲学家说,神的大多数属性都是我们如果在创造一位神时会选择的属性。你知道,有一位强大的神会很好,因为如果他是你的神,那么他可以帮助你。有一位仁慈的神会很好,那么如果你有罪他可以原谅你。几乎所有的属性都是我们会选择的属性,但有一个属性我们永远不会选择,爱德华兹说,那就是神的圣洁,因为它只是一个问题。

圣洁只不过是一个问题,对我们来说是一个大问题,如果你开始感觉到你正试图理解的这位神是圣洁的,你不仅仅是一个需要他属灵提升的好人,你甚至不仅仅是一个需要满足的有需要的人,而是你是一个罪人,你需要宽恕和赦免。你开始真正感觉到有一个问题,你在进入他的面前有问题。现在你有一些信心,你没有编造这位神。现在你有一些信心,你正在通往真神的路上,因为你感觉到你有一个个人问题,他不仅仅是一个抽象概念,他只是在试图相信他,但你在与他建立关系方面有问题。这自然地把我们带到最后一件事,你需要的是某种恩典,你需要某种能让你站在神面前的东西。摩西在想这个。

在下面第11和12节,摩西说,但我是什么人,你会派我去见法老？然后神说,我必与你同在。但如果你继续阅读经文,你会看到摩西在这里并没有被改变。摩西说,等一下,你是圣洁的。他开始看到他是谁,他是什么样子,他开始说,我到底怎么？好吧这样说,荆棘没有被烧毁,但为什么摩西没有？在《出埃及记》33章,摩西实际上问神,我能面对面地看到你吗？神说不,你不能,那会杀了你。

那么为什么它在这里没有被烧毁？荆棘没有被烧毁,好的,那是个奇迹,但为什么摩西没有被烧毁？秘密和答案,就在经文中,但你可能直接跳过了它,我也是。看这里到处都是,它说神从荆棘中对摩西说话。神从荆棘中对摩西说话,神从荆棘中对摩西说话,但实际上谁在荆棘中？它在第2节告诉你,耶和华的使者。

等一下,你说那很奇怪,它说使者在荆棘中,但然后在经文的其余部分,它谈论好像神在荆棘中,是的,在旧约中就是这样运作的。有这个人物,这个谜一样的人物名叫耶和华的使者,不是耶和华的一个使者,像加百列或类似的人,是耶和华的使者,当耶和华的使者出现时,这很奇怪,因为一方面这位耶和华的使者似乎是一个与神不同的人,另一方面耶和华的使者似乎是神。就像它会说耶和华的使者对亚伯拉罕说话,或者耶和华的使者对摩西说话,但然后下一节经文会说,神对摩西说,神对亚伯拉罕说,就好像这个人既是神又不是神。但这里所有这些有趣的是,亚历克·莫提尔说,如果你仔细看,耶和华的使者出现在神想要接近某人而不毁灭他们时。最有趣的地方之一是后来在《出埃及记》中,莫提尔说在摩西和神之间有这个来回的争论,摩西说,主啊,当以色列人离开埃及前往应许之地时,你的同在必须与我们同在。你的同在必须与我们同在,神说不。

我的同在不能与你们同在,因为你们是叛逆的民,我的同在会毁灭你们。然后摩西反驳说不,不,除非你与我们同去,否则我不会去。然后最后神说,莫提尔在他的《出埃及记》注释中指出这一点。他最后说,等等,好的,我告诉你我要做什么。我会派我的使者与你们同去。

这是莫提尔对此的评论。他说耶和华的使者被启示为神的仁慈调节,借此当主自己与他们同去时,主可以在有罪的民中同在。神的同在会烧毁他们。所以使者是神的那种模式,借此圣洁的神可以与罪人保持同在而不毁灭他们。然后莫提尔继续说,那会是谁？

他说在圣经中只有一位既与主相同又与主不同。一位在肯定神的愤怒的同时又是他仁慈的至高显现。耶和华的使者只能被理解为耶稣基督道成肉身之前的显现。你还记得在《约翰福音》第8章,耶稣对他的听众说,还没有亚伯拉罕,就有了我。他没有说还没有亚伯拉罕,我就存在了。

那已经够奇怪的了。但他说还没有亚伯拉罕,就有了我。他在说什么？他在说,我就是从荆棘中对摩西说话的那一位。现在这是秘密。

这是所有谜题的答案。你说,好吧,耶稣基督怎么是耶和华的使者？耶稣基督怎么是我们能在神面前而不被烧毁的方式？哦我的天哪,就是这样。这就是你最终能看到神之火的方式。

火既可怕又美丽。在十字架上你看到神是多么可怕地圣洁。他是如此可怕地圣洁,以至于耶稣基督必须死。神是积极地良善。神必须对罪施行惩罚。

不能被轻描淡写。他是如此可怕地圣洁,耶稣必须死,但他是如此美丽地慈爱,如此美丽地慈爱,以至于在耶稣基督里他愿意来,并乐意死,愿意死,做他自己的赎罪。就是这样。我们有关于这个的赞美诗。一首赞美诗说,在宝座前我们被赦免而站立,你的爱已经满足了你的律法的要求。

可怕,恐怖,美丽,华丽,如果你想知道这位火焰般神的迷人美丽,一位如此圣洁以至于你与他有问题的神,然而又如此慈爱以至于他以自己的代价解决了问题。如果你说,我想认识那位神,你就会认识那位神,为什么？因为那就是在荆棘中向摩西显现的神,那就是向人们显现的神。你知道如果你那样做会发生什么吗？如果你相信耶稣基督,你将成为一丛燃烧的荆棘。

摩西做到了。摩西出去改变了世界。为什么？因为神的荣耀和美丽进入了他的生活。事实上,有一次他不得不在脸上蒙上面纱,它没有烧毁他。

为什么？好吧,他并不真正确定。他只是知道以某种方式赎罪已经做成了,但你和我知道。彼得前书一章第3节说,基督徒已经成为神性的分享者。以弗所书2章说,我们是圣灵的殿,不寻常的光和美丽以及神的荣耀可以进入你的生活,然而你不会被烧毁,因为耶稣基督的功德和中保,然后你成为一丛小小的燃烧荆棘。

你成为一个人们会过去看的人,去弄清楚,因为你是无法解释的。当你成为一个能够,能够触摸他人或让神通过你触摸他人的人,你可以改变世界,你相信在荆棘中向摩西显现的神吗？让我们祷告。父神,我们感谢你给我们这条通往你的经历的道路,我们祈求你现在帮助我们,甚至当我们参与圣餐时认识你。不是一位抽象的神,而是一位火焰般慈爱的神。我们祈求你帮助这里的每一位基督徒经历你的真实,以及这里每一位还不认识你的人也来经历那真实,我们奉耶稣的名祈求。

阿们。感谢你在《生命中的福音》播客中加入我们。我们希望今天的教导能鼓励你与你认识的某人分享福音。今年八月是《生命中的福音》的"去分享月",我们策划了广泛的免费资源来帮助你采取简单的步骤分享福音。你可以在gospelandlife.com斜杠share访问它们。

我们相信神使用小行动来做大事,我们邀请你在本月做简单的小行动来去分享福音,因为福音改变一切。今天的讲道录制于2013年。你在《生命中的福音》播客上听到的讲道和讲座录制于1989年至2017年间,当时凯勒博士是救赎主长老会的主任牧师。

欢迎来到生命中的福音。当谈到公开表达你的信仰时，你感到有多自在？本月在播客中，提姆·凯勒探讨圣经对于拥有公开信仰的教导。他向我们展示在多元化社会中公开我们的信仰是什么样子，以一种能够创造文明、和平以及与邻舍有意义对话的方式。今晚的经文选读来自出埃及记第三章第1至14节。

摩西牧养他岳父米甸祭司叶忒罗的羊群，他把羊群领到旷野的尽头，来到何烈，就是神的山。耶和华的使者从荆棘中的火焰里向他显现。摩西看见荆棘被火烧着，却没有烧毁。于是摩西想，我要过去看这奇异的景象，为什么荆棘没有烧毁。耶和华见他过去要看，神就从荆棘中呼叫他。

摩西，摩西，摩西说，我在这里。神说，不要靠近这里。把你脚上的鞋脱下来，因为你所站的地方是圣地。然后他说，我是你父亲的神，是亚伯拉罕的神，以撒的神，雅各的神。摩西因为怕看神，就蒙上脸。

耶和华说，我确实看见了我百姓在埃及所受的苦难。我听见他们因受督工的压迫而发出的哀声，我关心他们的痛苦。所以我下来要救他们脱离埃及人的手，领他们从那地出来，到美好宽阔的地方。那是流奶与蜜之地，就是迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人的家。现在以色列人的哀声已经达到我这里，我也看见埃及人怎样压迫他们。

所以现在去吧。我要差遣你到法老那里，把我的百姓以色列人从埃及领出来。但摩西对神说，我是什么人，竟能到法老那里去，把以色列人从埃及领出来呢？神说，我必与你同在。这就是我差遣你的凭据。

当你把百姓从埃及领出来之后，你们要在这座山上敬拜神。摩西对神说，假如

我去到以色列人那里对他们说，你们祖先的神差遣我到你们这里来，他们若问我，他的名叫什么？我要对他们说什么呢？神对摩西说，我是自有永有的。你要对以色列人这样说。

自有永有的差我到你们这里来。这是主的话语，感谢神。现在，我们每周都在探讨这样一个主题：我们如何在公共场合谈论我们最深层的信仰，我们如何分享我们的身份、我们深层的信仰，但要以一种尊重他人、促进和平的方式来分享。我这些年观察到，在公共场合讨论信仰的最佳方式之一，不是简单地谈论你相信什么，而是也要谈论你是如何相信的。不只是内容本身，还有你所经历的过程或旅程，你知道，不只是说"这就是我所相信的"，而是你如何开始相信你所相信的？你如何开始对你所信的神产生信心？

这是一个旅程的叙述，或者有些人会称之为个人见证，我认为这会降低紧张气氛，因为当你不只是说"这就是我所相信的"，不，这就是我所相信的，而是在谈论你如何通过这个过程和经历来到你的信仰时，我认为这会赢得某种尊重，你知道，你倾听别人对自己经历的叙述，我认为这通常也很有帮助，因为每个人都在一个过程中，听到你如何经历你的过程是有帮助的。因此，为了帮助我们思考如何去思考这个问题，我们正在看这段非常著名的经文，摩西与燃烧的荆棘，这真是太糟糕了，Leo和我刚才还在这里谈论，也许你们中的一些人属于那一代人，但我很难不想到查尔顿·赫斯顿，以及塞西尔·B·德米尔的声音或者不管是谁的声音从燃烧的荆棘中传出来，我是说，这非常著名，那是电影《十诫》，你们中的一些人以前常去大银幕上看这些电影，我知道，抱歉，这有点像古老的历史了，但实际上，这段叙述就在这里，我们今晚看它是因为这是摩西的归信经历。这是摩西的归信

经历。这就是为什么他不仅仅是开始相信神，他已经相信神了。

事实上，当神对他说话时，他说，看，我是你父亲的神，亚伯拉罕、以撒和雅各的神，当他说这话时，他是在说，我就是你所相信的那位神，实际上，我是你父亲的神，你父亲的神，他知道摩西相信这位神，他从未遇见过他，他从未有过面对面的经历，他没有见过他，因此可以说这是摩西的归信经历，所以如果我们看到他是如何不仅仅开始相信神，而是真正遇见神的，我们就会看到使他达到那一步的四件事，我认为圣经说，如果你也要遇见他，通常在你的生命中也必须发生同样的四件事。所以，如果摩西是这样遇见他的，我们也需要这四件事，通常，才能真正经历和遇见神，那么这四件事是什么呢？它们是：一个打断的异象，一个扩展的概念，一个个人的问题，和一个令人惊讶的恩典。好的，首先，一个打断的异象。使摩西真正遇见神的第一件事是荆棘本身，第二和第三节。

摩西看见荆棘虽然着火，却没有烧毁，所以摩西想，我要过去看看这个奇怪的异象，为什么荆棘没有被烧毁，没有烧尽。现在，摩西最初可能在这边某个距离看到了一场灌木火灾，但那并不是那么不寻常，在沙漠中有很多原因可以发生灌木火灾，但引起他注意的是这火没有熄灭，正如你可以想象的，灌木火灾很快，为什么？因为那里没有多少燃料，一丛灌木，或一些灌木并不是什么好燃料，所以那里确实因为闪电或其他任何原因发生的火灾，或者可能是其他一些路过的牧羊人留下了营火还在燃烧。如果你要有一场灌木火灾，它会很快熄灭，但显然这丛荆棘一直在燃烧，燃烧，燃烧，燃烧，我们被告知摩西决定，我最好去看看这是什么，为什么？因为那说不通，它不合理，那是不可能的，一丛荆棘必须

烧尽，我的意思是火焰吞噬了荆棘丛然后熄灭，为什么荆棘丛还在继续燃烧，为什么火焰还在继续燃烧，我们被告知他走过去，看，这个词用了两次，我要过去看看这奇异的景象，第4节说，主看见他已经过去了，这是一个希伯来词，意思是绕道，他让自己被打断，他的正常路径被打断了，好的，第一个原则是什么，这是第一个原则，通常情况下，除非有些事情进入你的生活，是你无法解释的并且扰乱了你的生活或扰乱了你的思维，往往是严重地扰乱和打断你，否则你不会遇见神，摩西看到的燃烧的荆棘丛不符合他对可能发生的事情的理解，因为它不符合，他就过去看它，弄清楚它，思考它等等，而我们通常不会仅仅通过思考就对神产生信仰，我们通常必须有一些事情进入我们的生活，打断我们，是我们无法解释的，使我们以前所未有的方式思考。

托马斯·库恩在20世纪中叶写了一本书，叫做《科学革命的结构》，解释了这一点，这是一本学术书籍，你可能没有听说过，然而你可能听说过，因为它非常有名，至少可能不是通过名字，库恩在写关于科学如何运作的，《科学革命的结构》，库恩试图，他是一位科学哲学家，科学史学家，他说，实际上科学并不是按照你倾向于说的方式前进的，科学家喜欢说，我是客观的，当我得到新的数据时，我看着它，如果我追随证据的指引，所以我在逐渐做出小的改变，我在获得更多证据，我在变得更清晰，我在根据证据改变我的观点，库恩说不，事情不是这样运作的。库恩说，我们都非常封闭，我们所有人，我们不对新证据开放，他说我们所有人都倾向于有解释性网格，通过它我们解释现实。现在网格就是他所说的范式，所以是的，实际上他，我认为，使范式这个术语流行起来，范式是一种

看待现实的方式。库恩说，我们确实有这些观点，这些解释框架，这些看待现实的方式，当新证据出现时，我们会尽一切努力使用这些证据来证实我们已经相信的东西。我们会尽一切努力把它纳入其中，现在我告诉你，对我来说，一个完美的例子就是9-11事件。

我们所有人都在看着同样可怕的事情发生，我们直接看着它，就在那里。但有些人的解释框架认为，美国是世界上的坏人。我们是物质主义和滥用权力的力量，无论如何，我们是世界上的坏人。而另一些人则说，美国是好人，我们是正义的力量，站在正义一边对抗邪恶。所以一旦认为美国是好人，一旦认为美国是坏人，令人惊讶的是，我读了人们在9-11后写的文章，我们看着完全相同的事情，每个人都用它来说，看，这就是我一直说的，这就是我一直相信的。

看9-11事件，这证明了我们是坏人，世界憎恨我们。看9-11事件，其他人说，这证明了我们是好人，我们有邪恶在与我们对抗。我们有两组不同的人，有两种不同的范式，它们彼此完全相反，他们看着同样的数据，并用它来支持这个范式。托马斯·库恩说，我们不是思想开放的人，我们有我们的一套信念，当一条数据出现时，我们用它来证实我们已经相信的东西，但库恩说，有时候一些东西进入我们的生活，这会产生摩擦。有时候一些东西进入我们的生活，我们无法真正在这个框架中解释它，它并不真正契合，很难把它纳入其中。

当然，库恩的例子，经典的例子是我们西方对太阳系的理解。库恩说，多年来，人们相信地球是固定的，地球在中心，还有所有这些其他天体围绕着它运行，当然这似乎可以解释。你抬头看天空，你可以看到其他天体在移动，我们说，当然，它们都在围绕我们运行，所以每次你

我们得到了一点新数据，我们发现了一颗新行星，我们发现了另一个，你知道的，天文学家发现了另一个天体，他们当然说这符合我们的框架，然后库恩说，开始发生的事情是我们在太空中看到的一些天体似乎不太符合。它们的运动似乎不太符合一切都围绕地球运行的这个想法。其中一些在天空中无限地像之字形移动，这似乎真的不太行得通。

库恩说，最终会发生的是足够多的数据进来，你无法解释，或者有些东西进来，你无法解释，这导致你质疑框架本身，你坐在那里说，哦，也许我搞错了，然后你尝试，就像试穿一件衣服，你试穿一个新的范式，你尝试别的东西，然后你说，好吧，也许地球也在运行。当你试穿那个范式时，突然间它解释了所有的数据，你经历了他所说的范式转换，这就像一种皈依，突然间你意识到如果我改变框架，那么突然间我就能解释其他一切，你经历了这种巨大的转变，所以他说基本上因为我们是如此封闭的思想，我们不会一点一点地移动，我们不会改变我们的观点，相反，我们试图把一切都纳入来确认我们现有的范式，直到有些东西进来，一个燃烧的荆棘，一些不符合的东西，一些你无法解释的东西，你尝试一种新的思维方式，它创造了一个转变，基本上是一种皈依。

现在，对于上帝来说通常就是这样，通常有些东西进入你的生活，它是一个燃烧的荆棘，你无法解释它。你有一套信念，要么你不相信上帝，要么你相信可能有一个上帝但没人知道，你要么有一个无关紧要的上帝，要么你没有上帝，或者类似的东西，一个你不需要认识就能生活的上帝，然后有些东西进入你的生活，你无法解释它。这可能是一连串的思考，我们在过去几周讨论过这个，你知道，奥登，二战期间住在上东区的人，伟大的英国诗人，不相信上帝，但二战来了，我们讨论过这个

在过去几周的时间里。

第二次世界大战来临时，WHO看到纳粹所做的事情，他说，等一下，如果没有上帝，我有什么权利说我的价值观是对的，而有错误的一方？如果没有上帝，我有什么依据说我是对的而他们是错的？于是他这样思考，如果没有上帝，所有道德都是相对的，但不，道德不是相对的，他们所做的是错的，因此必定有上帝。这个思路不符合他的认知框架，于是他经历了范式转变。他改变了认知，他质疑了框架本身，所以这可能是一种智识上的燃烧荆棘，一条思路，但很多时候是其他东西。

多年前当Redeemer刚开始的时候，我们只有几百人，你知道，实际上在早期，我是指头几年，这个团体大约就是Redeemer的规模，整个Redeemer。那是80年代末、90年代初，我们就是普通的纽约人，我们是在华尔街工作的人，在艺术界工作的人，你知道，在时尚界工作的人，就是普通的纽约人，但我常常发现如果你带一个人进来，普通人中有99.9%的人晚上不相信历史性的基督教或类似的东西。但如果他们进来，他们只是坐下来，然后意识到我们都相信历史性的基督教，他们在这里待了大约10到15分钟，就开始经历范式转变。Redeemer本身就是一个燃烧的荆棘，你知道为什么吗？因为在他们的认知框架中，像他们这样的人，上过同样学校的人，做同样工作的人，像他们这样的人不相信基督教，你看，这是不合常理的，没有人这样做，除了这里有几百人在这样做。

那我们该怎么办呢？突然间Redeemer本身有时就是一个燃烧的荆棘，你可以看到小小的范式崩溃，你知道，从他们耳朵里冒出来，你知道，范式，旧的范式，正在发生转变，他们无法完全解释那些人，你知道，我们并不杰出，我们只是普通人，而普通人没有这些

信念，你怎么能相信那个呢？或者有时候一个基督徒进入你的生活，也许你不是信徒，而这个基督徒比你想象中的基督徒更有智慧、更沉着、更聪明、更有思想，这个基督徒本身就像一丛燃烧的荆棘。在继续之前，还有一件事，那些令人幻灭和艰难的经历，它们往往就是燃烧的荆棘。它们进入你的生活，你会说，听着，我不知道有没有上帝，也许有，也许没有，我不需要认识上帝，这就是你的框架，这意味着你的假设是我能应付生活，我能应付生活，你知道，我很聪明，我很精明，你知道，我有，我有治疗师，你知道，我有朋友，你知道，我不笨，你知道，我知道生活不容易，但我能应付生活。

大卫·马丁·劳埃德-琼斯是一位医生，1920年代英国的一位年轻医生。他成为了基督徒，他归信了，之后进入了传道事工，但他讲述他的归信经历，其中很大一部分是这样的。他相信，嗯，其中很大一部分是这样的，一个他敬佩的人，一位年长的医生，是他想成为的那种人，你看，在那个年代，英国最优秀的医生，他们是英雄，他们被效仿，他们，你知道，他们拯救生命，他们受人尊敬，他们才华横溢，他们，他们收入丰厚，他们有巨大的地位，劳埃德-琼斯仰慕的就是这样一个人，想成为像他那样的人，他正在和一个女人约会，她死了，巨大的悲剧。他顺道来看劳埃德-琼斯，他说，嘿，我在这里待一会儿可以吗，劳埃德-琼斯说，哦，靠着火炉吧，那个人，劳埃德-琼斯说，那个人拉了一把椅子到火炉边坐下，盯着火看了两个小时，一句话也没说。他也表现得好像劳埃德-琼斯不在那里一样。

现在，劳埃德-琼斯并没有感到被伤害，他也不觉得那有任何不妥。那完全是恰当的，但当他看到他所仰慕的一个人，一个征服世界的人，一个他认为的那种人

想要成为的样子，他意识到这个人已经完全耗尽了资源。他一无所有。他没有任何东西可以真正面对生活中的正常现实。劳埃德-琼斯说，他看着他凝视着火焰，这就是他所说的话。

他说，我突然看到了一切人类伟大的虚空。我突然看到了一切人类伟大的虚空。那里发生了什么？在那个年轻人的脑海中，那是一个燃烧的荆棘。那是一些不合常理的东西。

他说，等一下，等一下，等一下，如果像这样的人都无法应对生活，我怎么会认为我可以在没有神的情况下应对生活呢？所以，但重点在这里。当这些事情进入你的生活，开始挑战你，开始让你质疑自己的认知框架时，你愿意走过去吗？就像摩西一样。你知道，如果摩西没有走过去，如果他真的说，我不想被打扰，我们就永远不会听说过摩西了。

你看，一旦你感到困扰，你就必须愿意把它想明白。你必须有勇气去思考它，并愿意把它想明白。我们总是说福音改变一切，我们真的相信它确实如此。这就是为什么在"福音与生命"，八月是"去分享月"。整个八月，我们邀请成千上万的听众迈出一小步，与神放在你生活中的某个人分享福音。

再说一遍，那是 gospelandlife.com/give。现在，这里是凯勒博士今天教导的其余部分。芭芭拉·布朗·泰勒在她关于燃烧荆棘的著名讲道中说，想象一下如果摩西

只是耸起肩膀，低着头，一直忙着自己的事。如果摩西说，燃烧的荆棘？

我没真的看到。我不知道那是什么。燃烧的荆棘？嗯，可能有什么合理的解释吧。燃烧的荆棘。

我是被雇来看羊的，不是转过身去看荆棘的。燃烧的荆棘，有人能把它扑灭吗？如果他那样做了，你永远不会听说过他。他永远不会遇见神。神永远不会对他说话，同样的事也会发生在你身上。

他必须转过身去，明白吗？所以我打断了视线。第二和第三，它们有点联系在一起。第二和第三，如果你真的要遇见神，其次，你必须有一个不断扩展的神的概念。那么，我说的扩展概念是什么意思呢？

好吧，让我们看看神以火的形式显现自己这个概念。为什么神以火的形式显现自己？原因之一是他要传达圣经中关于神最令人震惊、最不可思议的事情之一。你看，摩西去看荆棘的原因是荆棘通常依赖于，我是说，对不起，火通常依赖于荆棘。它依赖于荆棘作为燃料。

因此，火不会永远燃烧，因为它们必须有燃料。在它们消耗完燃料后，它们就熄灭了。为什么？它们依赖于燃料。但这火不依赖于荆棘。

它不依赖于任何东西。它有自己内在的存在力量，这当然是一个神迹。但这象征着什么呢？它象征着神在最后对自己所说的话。当摩西说，那么我应该说是谁差我到以色列去呢？

换句话说，你的名字是什么？你知道神说什么吗？我告诉你我的名字是什么。他说，我是自有永有的。告诉他们，自有永有者差你去。

现在这实际上很难翻译。神真正给摩西的，作为他的名字，实际上只是希伯来语的动词"是"。这就像他几乎在说，告诉他们存在本身差你去。我是我所是的，我是我所是的，但基本上就是存在本身。这就是他在说的。

我不依赖于任何东西。一切都依赖于我。我是自足的。我拥有一切存在的力量在我自己里面。我是

万有的根基。

你知道，当圣经说上帝没有终结时，我想我们多少能够想象。但当圣经说上帝没有开始时，我的大脑就开始崩溃了。但必须如此，为什么？因为如果某样东西有开始，那是因为有什么使它开始。如果上帝有开始，就会有什么使上帝开始，而那个使上帝开始的东西，上帝就会依赖于它，但上帝说，我不依赖于任何东西。

所有的存在只在我里面才有其存在。我在每一个分子的核心。我维系着万有。希伯来书谈到这一点。万有都在他里面得以维系。

所以上帝在这里想说的是，我就是存在本身。我就是存有本身。我是万有的根基。我不只是一个存在者，我就是存在。我不只是一个存有，我就是存有。

我是自有永有的。耶稣用稍微更有位格性的话说，离了他你们什么都不能做。现在我在这里想说的是什么呢。我们可以对此谈论很多，这就是上帝在这里启示的名字。但我想向你展示的是，摩西对上帝的理解在不断扩展。

他对上帝有一个看法，但这是什么呢？一般来说，当人们跟我说他们无法相信上帝时。一般来说，我可以问他们，告诉我你不相信什么，告诉我为什么很难相信上帝。他们总是描述为什么我不能相信一个做这些事的上帝，我不能，而且五次中有四次，在他们告诉我他们不喜欢上帝什么以及为什么他们不能相信上帝之后。五次中有四次，我可以说，哦，这太好了。

我也不相信那个上帝。你说的那个上帝不是我所信的上帝，他们说什么？人们不相信的总是那个扁平的上帝，一个简化论的上帝，一个被缩减的上帝。完全不像圣经中那位多维度的、丰富的、丰富的上帝。圣经谈论上帝是这样的，但他也是这样，他是这样，但他也是这样，矛盾地说他是这样，他也是这样，你对上帝的理解越简单，就越容易被拒绝。

我甚至要说，你对上帝的理解越丰富、越细腻，

上帝，你越了解祂，就越难拒绝祂，也越容易相信祂。当然，也越难轻易地拒绝祂。摩西所得到的是对上帝不断扩展的理解，如果你也在扩展你对上帝的理解，并获得对上帝更丰富的认识，你就在朝着正确的方向前进。所以他有了一个颠覆性的一面，他有了一个扩展的概念。第三，有一个个人的问题。

现在我所说的个人问题是什么意思呢？让我们回到火的场景。上帝通过火要传达许多信息，这里是其中之一。火既美丽又可怕。它既辉煌又吸引人，同时又危险又令人恐惧。

看。摩西说，我在这里，第5节，不要再靠近了，上帝说，脱下你的鞋，因为你所站的地方是圣地。此时摩西遮住了他的脸，因为他害怕看上帝。现在，伟大的旧约圣经学者亚历克·莫蒂尔说，关于这节经文，上帝的圣洁是上帝本性中对像你我这样的罪人来说是危险的那部分。上帝的圣洁是上帝本性中对像你我这样的罪人来说是危险的那部分。

只有当我们听到这一点时，我们纽约人会说，我想要一个有爱的上帝，你说什么意思？危险？危险？祂就像火一样。祂是美丽的，但祂是危险的。

我不认为我喜欢这样，但实际上，请和我一起思考一下。为什么上帝是危险的？为什么上帝的圣洁是祂可怕的危险？好吧，首先有两个原因。上帝的圣洁，首先意味着祂通过祂的完美来暴露我们。

来吧，你知道这个词，这是如何运作的。每当你在绝对的、令人难以置信的才华、美丽或智慧面前，当你在一个拥有卓越品质的人面前时，这就像火一样。为什么？它既美妙又可怕。看，你可能认为自己长相还不错，但有些人你不想站在他们旁边，因为你不想让人们从你看向他或她。

你不想那样。你知道，你觉得我长相还不错，然后你靠近某个让你

比你好看十倍，然后你就感到自己又土又丑。你可能认为自己很有才华，你知道，这是一个真实的故事，当然，这种事经常发生。你可能是德克萨斯州热咖啡小镇上最好的小提琴手，你知道，小镇很小，你知道，然后你在纽约市下了火车，看到有人在乞讨，你知道，在中央车站，你知道，琴盒打开，人们往里扔钱，他们在演奏，而且比你强得多。你会想，哦不，发生什么了？

这很美妙。我是说，小提琴手很美妙。你说，嗯，那很美，技巧很好，但你被吓坏了。每当你置身于比你强得多的事物面前时，这既可怕又美妙。那么，对于神来说会是怎样呢？

当然是这样。这是你知道自己正在接近真神的方式之一。当以赛亚进去见至高者，被高举的圣者，圣哉，圣哉，圣哉，他听到天使在说，他进入圣殿，看到了神的圣洁，你就明白了。以赛亚，他是先知。以赛亚，与大多数人相比，他必定更有美德，更属灵，更有道德，是比大多数人更好的人，但他怎么说自己呢？

不洁净，他这样称呼自己。以赛亚所引以为傲的一切看起来都像垃圾。因为在能力面前，你感到自己的软弱；在美丽面前，你感到自己的丑陋；在光明面前，你感到自己的黑暗。因此神是危险的，因为他如此圣洁，如此完美，如此美丽，以至于令人恐惧。因为当你靠近他时，你会经历自我震荡，你的自我形象会崩塌。

所有你告诉自己的那些话——我不是那么坏的人——都不是真的。那就是不真实的，你意识到那不真实。你所有的自我辩护，你所有的小小自欺，我们都有的盲目。每个人都知道这一点。我们总是有点，那个人很可怕，那个人很可怕，但我呢，你得理解。

你总是在为自己找借口，但在神的面前，这是极其创伤性的。这在逻辑上是绝对毁灭性的。这是极其危险的，因为神

是如此美丽，祂是危险的。祂向你展示你是谁。所以祂的完美暴露了你，但祂也是一位主动行善的上帝。

主动善良和被动善良之间的区别，有很多研究表明，在德国大屠杀期间，大多数德国人对犹太人的消失感到难过。他们为此辩护。他们告诉自己，好吧，他们只是去了拘留营，我的意思是，他们总是，他们对自己撒谎，所以他们不想承认，但基本上，大多数德国人看到犹太人就这样消失了。他们看到犹太邻居就这样消失了，他们对此感到难过。为什么？

人们，但他们是被动的善良。他们什么也没说。他们没有制造波澜。他们害怕这样做。我们都知道，被动的善良不如主动的善良，而上帝是主动行善的。

上帝不仅仅是一般意义上的善良。祂不容忍邪恶，祂不容忍你身上的邪恶和罪恶。因此，这是有危险的。现在这是第三点，非常重要。如果你要有一个上帝的经历并遇见上帝，那真的应该是一位真正的上帝。

我们深受消费资本主义的影响，在消费资本主义中，我们选择一切。我们得到我们想要的。一切都为我们定制。所以你难道看不出我们倾向于做什么吗？我就这样做。

你难道不能这样做吗？你得到你想要的上帝。你说，我不喜欢像这样相信上帝。我喜欢像这样相信上帝。我听到人们这样说。

我喜欢这样想象上帝。我喜欢这样想象上帝。如果你在创造你自己的上帝，那只是你的延伸。那家伙怎么能对你有任何帮助呢？那家伙怎么能给你任何力量呢？

那只是你自己。那家伙怎么能成为任何资源呢？那只是你自己。如果你实际上只是在创造你喜欢的上帝。那么你怎么能确定你正在接近一位真正的上帝，一个真正的灵性实在，一位真实的上帝，一位活着的上帝？

你怎么知道呢？18世纪伟大的神学家哲学家乔纳森·爱德华兹说，上帝的大多数属性都是我们在创造上帝时会选择的属性。你知道，拥有一位强大的上帝会很好，因为如果祂

你的神，那么他就能帮助你。有一位仁慈的神会很好，那么如果你有罪，他可以赦免你。几乎所有的属性都是我们会选择的属性，但爱德华兹说，有一个属性是我们永远不会选择的，那就是神的圣洁，因为它就是一个问题。

这个圣洁对我们来说只是一个问题，一个大问题，如果你开始感觉到你正在努力理解的这位神是圣洁的，而你不只是一个需要从他那里得到属灵提升的好人，你甚至不只是一个需要满足的有需要的人，而是你是一个罪人，你需要赦免和饶恕。你开始真正感觉到有一个问题，当你来到他面前时你有一个问题。现在你有了一些信心，相信你不是在编造这位神。现在你有了一些信心，相信你正在走向真神的路上，因为你感觉到你有一个个人的问题，他不只是一个抽象概念，你不只是试图相信他，而是你在与他建立关系时遇到了问题，这自然就把我们带到最后一件你需要的事情上，你需要某种恩典，你需要某种东西能使你站在神的面前。摩西正在思考这个问题。

在这里的11节和12节，摩西说，但我是谁，你竟差遣我到法老那里去，然后神说，我必与你同在，但如果你继续读这段经文，你会看到摩西在这里并没有被修改。摩西说，等一下，你是圣洁的。他开始看到他是谁，他是什么样的，他开始说，我到底怎么能？这样说吧，荆棘没有被烧毁，但为什么摩西没有被烧毁？在出埃及记33章，摩西实际上问神，我能面对面见你吗？神说不，你不能，这会杀死你。

那么为什么这里没有被烧毁呢？荆棘没有被烧毁，好的，这是一个神迹，但为什么摩西没有被烧毁？这个秘密和答案就在经文中，但你可能直接略过了，我也是。看看这里的所有地方，它说神从荆棘中对摩西说话。神从荆棘中对摩西说话，神从荆棘中对摩西说话，但实际上谁在荆棘中呢？第2节告诉了你，是耶和华的使者

耶和华。

等一下,你说这很奇怪,经文说天使在荆棘丛中,但接下来的整段经文都说得好像神在荆棘丛中,是的,旧约就是这样运作的。有这样一个人物,这个神秘的人物叫做耶和华的使者,不是耶和华的一个使者,像加百列或类似的那种,而是"那位"耶和华的使者,当耶和华的使者出现时,很奇怪,因为一方面这位耶和华的使者似乎是与神不同的一个位格,另一方面耶和华的使者又似乎就是神。比如经文会说耶和华的使者对亚伯拉罕说话,或者耶和华的使者对摩西说话,但紧接着下一节经文又会说,神对摩西说,神对亚伯拉罕说,就好像这个人既是神又不是神。但这里非常有趣的是,亚历克·莫蒂尔说,如果你仔细观察,耶和华的使者出现是在神想要亲近某人而又不毁灭他们的时候。其中一个最有趣的地方是在出埃及记的后面,莫蒂尔说摩西和神之间有这样一段来回的争论,摩西说,主啊,你的同在必须与我们同去,当以色列人离开埃及前往应许之地时。

你的同在必须与我们同去,神说不行。我的同在不能与你们同去,因为你们是悖逆的百姓,我的同在会毁灭你们。然后摩西反驳说,不,不,除非你与我们同去,否则我不走,最后神说,莫蒂尔在他的出埃及记注释中指出了这一点。神最后说,等等,好吧,我告诉你我要做什么。我会差遣我的使者与你们同去。

莫蒂尔对此这样说。摩西说,我要你的同在。神说不行,那会毁灭你们。摩西说我要你的同在。好吧,我会差遣我的使者给你。

莫蒂尔在他的注释中这样说。他说耶和华的使者被启示为神的怜悯性调适,藉此耶和华可以住在有罪的百姓中间,而如果他亲自与他们同去的话。神的同在会吞灭他们。所以这位使者是神性的那种模式,藉此圣洁的神可以与罪人同行而不毁灭他们。

他们。然后马蒂尔接着说,那会是谁呢?

他说,在圣经中只有一位既与主相同又与主有别。一位在申明神的愤怒的同时却又是神怜悯的至高彰显。耶和华的使者只能被理解为耶稣基督道成肉身之前的显现。你还记得在约翰福音第8章,耶稣对他的听众说,还没有亚伯拉罕就有了我。他没有说在亚伯拉罕之前我曾经存在。

那样说已经够奇怪了。但他说的是还没有亚伯拉罕就有了我。他在说什么呢?他是说,我就是那位从荆棘丛中对摩西说话的那一位。现在这就是秘密所在。

这就是所有谜题的答案。你说,那么,耶稣基督如何成为耶和华的使者呢?耶稣基督如何成为我们能够来到神面前而不被烧灭的途径呢?哦,我的天哪,答案就在这里。这就是你最终能看见神之火的方式。

火既可怕又美丽。在十字架上,你看到神是何等可怕地圣洁。他是如此可怕地圣洁,以至于耶稣基督必须要死。神是主动良善的。神必须对罪施以惩罚。

这不能被轻易忽略。他是如此可怕地圣洁,耶稣必须要死,但他又是如此美好地慈爱,如此美好地慈爱,以至于在耶稣基督里,他愿意来并乐意死,愿意死,作成他自己的赎罪祭。就是这样。我们有赞美诗歌唱这个。一首赞美诗这样唱到,在宝座前我们得赦免站立,你的爱已满足,你律法的要求。

可怕的,恐怖的,美丽的,华美的,如果你想认识这位如火焰般的神令人陶醉的美,一位如此圣洁以至于你与他之间有问题、但又如此慈爱以至于他自己付出代价解决了这个问题的神。如果你说,我想认识那位神,你就会认识那位神,为什么?因为那就是在荆棘丛中向摩西启示自己的神,那就是向人启示自己的神。你猜如果你这样做会发生什么?如果你相信耶稣基督,你就会成为一个燃烧的荆棘丛。

摩西就是这样。摩西出去改变了世界。为什么?因为神的荣耀和美丽进入了他的生命。事实上,有一次他不得不在脸上蒙上帕子,而神的荣耀并没有烧灭他。

为什么呢？其实，他并不太确定。他只知道某种方式的赎罪已经完成了，但你我都知道。彼得前书1章3节说，基督徒已经与神的性情有份。以弗所书2章说，我们是圣灵的殿，神的光芒、非凡的光辉、美丽和荣耀能进入你的生命，而你却不会被吞灭，因为耶稣基督的功德和中保之工，然后你就成为了一个小小的燃烧的荆棘。

你就成为一个让人们过来观看的人，想要弄明白，因为你是无法解释的。当你成为一个能够触摸他人的人，或者让神通过你触摸他人，你就能改变世界，你相信那位向摩西显现在燃烧荆棘中的神与我们同在吗？让我们祷告吧。父啊，我们感谢你赐给我们这条经历你的道路，我们祈求你现在帮助我们，甚至当我们领受圣餐时能认识你。那不是一位抽象的神，而是一位火热慈爱的神。我们祷告求你帮助这里的每一位基督徒经历你的真实，也帮助这里每一位还不认识你的人也能来经历这一真实，我们奉耶稣的名祈求。

欢迎来到《生命中的福音》。当谈到公开表达你的信仰时，你感到有多自在？本月在播客中，提姆·凯勒探讨圣经关于公开信仰的教导。他向我们展示了在多元社会中公开表达我们的信仰是什么样子，以一种创造文明、和平以及与邻居之间有意义对话的方式。今晚的经文来自《出埃及记》第3章第1至14节。

> **出埃及记 3:1-14**
> 
> 1 摩西牧养他岳父米甸祭司叶忒罗的羊群；一日领羊群往野外去，到了　神的山，就是何烈山。2 耶和华的使者从荆棘里火焰中向摩西显现。摩西观看，不料，荆棘被火烧着，却没有烧毁。3 摩西说：「我要过去看这大异象，这荆棘为何没有烧坏呢？」4 耶和华　神见他过去要看，就从荆棘里呼叫说：「摩西！摩西！」他说：「我在这里。」5 神说：「不要近前来。当把你脚上的鞋脱下来，因为你所站之地是圣地」；6 又说：「我是你父亲的　神，是亚伯拉罕的　神，以撒的　神，雅各的　神。」摩西蒙上脸，因为怕看　神。
> 
> 7 耶和华说：「我的百姓在埃及所受的困苦，我实在看见了；他们因受督工的辖制所发的哀声，我也听见了。我原知道他们的痛苦，8 我下来是要救他们脱离埃及人的手，领他们出了那地，到美好、宽阔、流奶与蜜之地，就是到迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人之地。9 现在以色列人的哀声达到我耳中，我也看见埃及人怎样欺压他们。10 故此，我要打发你去见法老，使你可以将我的百姓以色列人从埃及领出来。」
> 
> 11 摩西对　神说：「我是甚么人，竟能去见法老，将以色列人从埃及领出来呢？」12 神说：「我必与你同在。你将百姓从埃及领出来之后，你们必在这山上事奉我；这就是我打发你去的证据。」13 摩西对　神说：「我到以色列人那里，对他们说：『你们祖宗的　神打发我到你们这里来。』他们若问我说：『他叫甚么名字？』我要对他们说甚么呢？」14 神对摩西说：「我是自有永有的」；又说：「你要对以色列人这样说：『那自有的打发我到你们这里来。』」

这是耶和华的话，感谢神。

现在，我们每周都在探讨一个主题，就是我们如何能在公开场合谈论我们最深层的信仰信念，我们如何能分享我们是谁，我们深层的信仰信念，但以一种尊重的方式，促进和平。我多年来观察到，在公开场合讨论信仰的最好方式之一，不仅仅是谈论你相信什么，还要谈论你是如何相信的。不仅仅是内容，还有过程或你所经历的旅程。你知道，这不仅仅是，这是我所相信的，而是你是如何相信你所相信的？你是如何对你所信仰的神产生信心的？

这是一个旅程叙述，或者有些人会称之为个人见证，我认为这会降低温度，因为当你不仅仅是在说，这是我所相信的，不，这是我所相信的，你是在谈论你形成信仰的过程和经历，我认为这会赢得某种尊重，你知道，你倾听一个人对他们经历的叙述，我认为这通常也很有帮助，因为每个人都在一个过程中，听你如何经历你的过程是有帮助的。为了帮助我们思考如何思考这个问题，我们正在看这段经文，这是非常著名的，摩西与燃烧的荆棘。利昂和我刚才在这里谈论，也许你们中的一些人是那一代，但我很难不想到查尔顿·赫斯顿，以及西塞尔·B·德米尔的声音或是谁的声音从燃烧的荆棘中发出。我的意思是，这是非常著名的，那是电影《十诫》，你们中的一些人过去常常去大银幕上看电影之类的，我知道这有点像古代历史了，抱歉。但实际上，这段记载在这里，我们今晚看它是因为这是摩西的归信经历。这是摩西的归信经历。这就是他不仅相信神，他已经相信神了。

事实上，当神对他说话时，他说，看，我是你父亲的神，亚伯拉罕、以撒和雅各的神。当他说这话时，他是在说，我是你所相信的神。实际上，我是你父亲的神，你父亲的神，他知道摩西相信这位神，他从未遇见过他，他从未面对面地与他接触过，他没有遇见他，因此可以说这是摩西的归信经历。所以如果我们看到他不仅仅是相信神，而是真正遇见神，我们将看到四件事带他到达那里，我认为圣经说如果你要遇见他，你的生命中通常也必须发生同样的四件事。所以，如果摩西以这种方式遇见他，我们需要这四件事，通常，才能真正经历并遇见神。那是哪四件事呢？它们是一个打断的景象、一个扩展的概念、一个个人问题和一个令人惊讶的恩典。好的，首先，一个打断的景象。第一件带摩西真正遇见神的事是荆棘本身，第2和第3节。

摩西看见荆棘被火烧着，却没有烧毁，摩西说，我要过去看这大异象，为何荆棘没有被烧毁。现在，摩西最初可能在这边看到了一场灌木丛火灾，有一定距离，但那并不是很不寻常，沙漠中有很多原因可能导致灌木丛火灾。但引起他注意的是这火没有熄灭，正如你可以想象的，灌木丛火灾很快，为什么？因为那里没有燃料，一丛灌木，或一些灌木丛在燃料方面并不多，所以那里发生的火灾，因为闪电或其他什么原因，或者也许是其他路过的牧羊人留下了篝火在燃烧。如果你要有一场灌木丛火灾，它很快就会熄灭，但显然这丛荆棘不断地燃烧，燃烧，燃烧，燃烧，我们被告知摩西决定，我最好去看看这是什么，为什么？因为那没有道理，不合理，那是不可能的，一丛荆棘必须烧完，我的意思是火消耗了荆棘，然后它就熄灭了，为什么荆棘继续燃烧，为什么火继续燃烧，我们被告知他过去了。看，它两次使用这个词，我要过去看这大异象，第4节说，耶和华见他过去要看。那是一个希伯来词，意思是绕道，他让自己被打断了，他的正常路径被打断了。好的，第一个原则是什么？这是第一个原则：通常你不会遇见神，除非有什么事情进入你的生活，是你无法解释的，并且打断了你的生活或打断了你的思考，非常经常是严重地打断和中断你。摩西所看到的燃烧的荆棘不符合他对可能发生的事情的理解，因为它不符合，他过去去看它，弄清楚它，考虑它等等。我们通常不会仅仅通过思考就对神产生信心，我们通常必须有某些事情进入我们的生活，打断我们，我们无法解释，并使我们以以前没有的方式思考。

托马斯·库恩在20世纪中叶写了一本书叫《科学革命的结构》，解释了这一点。这是一本学术书籍，你可能没有听说过，但你可能听说过，因为它非常有名，至少也许不是名字。库恩在写关于科学如何运作的，《科学革命的结构》。库恩试图，他是科学哲学家，科学史学家，他说，实际上科学不像你倾向于说的那样向前发展。科学家喜欢说，我是客观的，当我得到新的数据时，我看着它，如果我追随证据走向何方，所以我逐渐做出小的改变，我得到更多的证据，我对你越来越清楚，我根据证据改变我的观点。库恩说不，那不是它的运作方式。库恩说，我们都非常封闭，我们所有人，我们不对新证据开放。他说我们所有人都倾向于有解释性网格，通过它我们解释现实。现在网格就是他所说的范式，所以是的，实际上他，我想，普及了"范式"这个词。范式是一种看待现实的方式。库恩说，我们真的有这些观点，这些解释性网格，这些看待现实的方式，当新证据出现时，我们尽一切可能使用那些证据来确认我们已经相信的。我们尽一切可能把它纳入进来。现在我告诉你，对我来说，一个完美的例子是9-11。

我们所有人都在看同样的可怕事情发生，我们正看着它，就在那里。但有些人有一个解释性网格，说美国是世界上的坏人。我们是物质主义和滥用权力的力量，无论如何，我们是世界上的坏人。还有另一些人说，美国是好人，我们是善的力量，站在善的一边对抗邪恶。所以一旦美国是好人，一旦美国是坏人，令人惊讶的是，我读了人们在9-11之后的文章，我们看着完全相同的事情，每个人都用它来说，看，这就是我一直说的，这就是我一直相信的。

看9-11，那证明了我们是坏人，世界恨我们。看9-11，其他人说，那证明了我们是好人，我们有邪恶与我们对抗。我们有两组不同的人，有两种不同的范式，它们彼此完全相反，他们看着同样的数据，用它来支持范式。托马斯·库恩说，我们不是思想开放的人，我们有我们的一套信念，当一段数据出现时，我们用它来确认我们已经相信的，除了库恩说，有时候东西进入我们的生活，这擦。有时候东西进入我们的生活，我们真的无法在网格中解释，它真的不合适，很难把它纳入进来。

库恩的例子，当然，经典例子是我们西方对太阳系的理解。库恩说，多年来，人们相信地球是固定的，地球在中心，所有这些其他天体围绕它运行，当然那似乎解释了。你抬头看天空，你可以看到其他天体在移动，我们说，当然，它们都在围绕我们运行，所以每次你得到新的数据，我们发现了一颗新的行星，我们发现了另一个，你知道，天文学家发现了另一个天体，他们说当然那符合网格。然后库恩说，开始发生的是我们在太空中看到的一些天体似乎不合适。它们的运动似乎不符合这个想法，即一切都在围绕地球运行。它们中的一些在天空中像之字形移动，这似乎真的不起作用。

库恩说，最终发生的是足够的数据进来，你无法解释，或者有什么东西进来，你无法解释，它导致你质疑网格本身，你坐在那里说，哦，也许我错了。你试穿，就像试穿一件衣服，你试穿一个新范式，你试穿别的东西，你说，好吧，也许地球也在运行。当你试穿那个范式时，突然它解释了所有的数据，你有了他所说的范式转换。这就像一次归信，突然你意识到如果我改变网格，那么突然我可以解释其他一切，你有这个巨大的转变。所以他说基本上因为我们如此封闭，我们不移动，我们不一点一点地改变我们的身体，相反，我们试图把一切都纳入以确认我们现有的范式，直到有东西进来，一丛燃烧的荆棘，某些不合适的东西，你无法解释的东西，你试穿一种新的思考方式，它创造了一个转变，基本上是一种归信。现在，这就是神的情况，通常，通常有什么东西进入你的生活，它是一丛燃烧的荆棘，你无法解释它。你有一套信念，要么你不相信神，要么你相信可能有一位神，但没有人知道，你要么有一位无关紧要的神，要么你没有神，或者类似的东西，一位你不需要认识就能生活的神。然后有什么东西进入你的生活，你无法解释它。这可能是一连串的思考，我们在过去几周谈论过这个，你知道，W.H.奥登，在二战期间住在上东区，伟大的英国诗人，不相信神，但二战来了，我们在过去几周详细谈论了这个。

二战来了，奥登看到纳粹人所做的事，他说，等一下，没有神，我有什么权利说我的价值观是对的，有错的？如果没有神，我有什么根据说我是对的，他们是错的？所以他这样想，如果没有神，所有道德都是相对的，但不，道德不是相对的，他们所做的是错的，因此必定有一位神。这一连串的思考出现了，不符合他的网格，他有了一次范式转换。他有了一个改变，他质疑了网格本身，所以这可能是一种智力上的燃烧荆棘，一连串的思考，但通常是其他东西。

多年前，当救赎主教会开始时，我们有几百人，你知道，实际上在早期，我是说最初几年，这个群体大约是救赎主教会的规模，整个救赎主教会。这是80年代末、90年代初，我们只是普通的纽约人，我们是在华尔街工作的人，在艺术界工作，你知道，在时尚界工作，只是普通的纽约人。但我过去常常发现，如果你带一个人进来，普通男人99.9%的普通男人晚上不相信历史性基督教或类似的东西。但如果他们进来，他们只是坐下来，他们意识到我们都相信历史性基督教，他们在那里大约10或15分钟，他们开始有范式转换。救赎主教会本身就是一丛燃烧的荆棘，你知道为什么吗？因为在他们的网格中，像他们这样的人，去过同样学校的人，做同样工作的人，像他们这样的人不相信基督教，看，这只是不做，没有人做，除了这里有几百人在做。

那么我们要怎么办呢？突然救赎主教会本身有时就是一丛燃烧的荆棘，你可以看到小的范式崩溃，你知道，从他们的耳朵里冒出来，你知道，范式，旧范式，正在发生转变，他们无法完全解释那些人，你知道，我们并不聪明，我们只是普通人，普通人没有这些信念，你怎么能相信那个？或者有时一个基督徒进入你的生活，也许你不是信徒，那个基督徒比你想象的基督徒可以是的要聪明得多，或者要沉着得多，或者要有智慧得多，或者要有思想得多，那个基督徒本身就像一丛燃烧的荆棘。我们非常经常，再说一件事再继续，非常经常令人失望和困难的经历，非常经常它们是燃烧的荆棘。它们进入你的生活，你在说，看，我不知道有没有神，可能有，可能没有，我不需要认识神，那是你的网格，这意味着你的假设是我能处理生活，我能处理生活，你知道，我很聪明，我很精明，你知道，我有，我有一个治疗师，你知道，我有朋友，你知道，我不笨，你知道，我知道生活不容易，但我能处理生活。

戴维·马丁·劳埃德-琼斯是一位医生，1920年代在英国的年轻医生。他成为了基督徒，他归信了，之后进入了事工，但他讲述了他的归信，其中很大一部分是这样的。他相信，好吧，其中很大一部分是这样的，一个他钦佩的男人，一个年长的男人，他是医生，是他想成为的一切，你看，在那个时代，英国最好的医生，他们是英雄，他们受到仿效，他们受到，你知道，他们拯救生命，他们受到尊重,他们很聪明,他们受到,他们薪水很高,他们有巨大的地位,就是这些人之一,劳埃德-琼斯仰慕并想成为像他那样的人,他在约会一个女人,她死了,巨大的悲剧。他来看劳埃德-琼斯,他说,嘿,如果我在这里待一会儿可以吗？劳埃德-琼斯说,哦,到火炉边去。那个男人,劳埃德-琼斯说,那个男人把椅子拉到火炉边坐下,盯着火看了两个小时,一句话也没说。他也没有表现得好像劳埃德-琼斯在那里。

现在,劳埃德-琼斯没有感到他的感情受到伤害,他也不觉得,以任何方式,那是不恰当的。那是完全恰当的,但当他看到他钦佩的人之一,一个世界级人物,一个他想成为像他那样的人,他意识到这个人完全没有资源了。他什么都没有剩下。他没有什么可以真正面对生活的正常现实。劳埃德-琼斯说,他看着他盯着火,这是他说的。

他说,我突然看到了所有人类伟大的虚荣。我突然看到了所有人类伟大的虚荣。那里发生了什么？在那个年轻人的心中,这是一丛燃烧的荆棘。这是某些不符合的东西。

他说,等一下,等一下,等一下,如果一个像这样的人都不能处理生活,我怎么能认为我能在没有神的情况下处理生活？所以,但这是重点。当这些事情进入你的生活,它们开始挑战你,它们开始让你质疑网格,你愿意过去吗？像摩西一样。你知道,如果摩西没有过去,如果他实际上说,我不想被打扰,你就永远不会听说摩西了。

看,一旦你被打扰了,你必须愿意想清楚。你必须有勇气想清楚,愿意想清楚。我们总是说福音改变一切,我们真的相信它确实如此。这就是为什么在这里的《生命中的福音》,八月是"去分享月"。在整个八月,我们邀请我们数千名听众在与神放在你生活中的某人分享福音方面迈出一小步。

对于那些在本月向《生命中的福音》捐赠的人,我们将寄给你两本提姆·凯勒的《神合乎情理》。这是一个强大的资源,探讨基督教如何在当今世界中在情感上、文化上和理性上合乎情理。这是对你捐赠的感谢,并提供了一种你可以做一个小行动来分享福音的方式,通过与朋友一起阅读这本书,送给同事一本,或者把两本都传递给正在探索基督教信仰的人。这是一种简单的方式来开始或继续福音对话。要索取你的两本《神合乎情理》,只需访问gospelandlife.com斜杠give。

再次强调,那是gospelandlife.com斜杠give。现在,这是凯勒博士今天教导的剩余部分。芭芭拉·布朗·泰勒在她关于燃烧荆棘的著名讲道中说,想象一下如果摩西只是耸耸肩,低着头,继续忙碌。如果摩西说,燃烧的荆棘？

我没真的看到它。我不知道那是什么。燃烧的荆棘？好吧,可能有某种理性的解释。燃烧的荆棘。

我被雇来看羊,不是转过身去看荆棘。燃烧的荆棘,有人能把它扑灭吗？如果他那样做了,你就永远不会听说他了。他就永远不会遇见神。神就永远不会对他说话,同样的事情也会发生在你身上。

他必须转过身去,好吗？所以我打断的景象。第二和第三,它们有点一起。第二和第三,如果你真的要遇见神,第二,你必须有一个扩展的神的概念。现在,我所说的扩展概念是什么意思？

好吧,让我们看看神以火显现自己的这个想法。为什么神以火显现自己？原因之一是他正在传达圣经关于神所说的最令人震惊、惊人的事情之一。看,摩西去看荆棘的原因是荆棘通常依赖于，我的意思是,抱歉,火通常依赖于荆棘。它依赖于荆棘作为燃料。

因此,火不会永远持续,因为它们必须有燃料。在它们消耗燃料之后,它们就消失了。为什么？它们依赖于燃料。但这火不依赖于荆棘。

它不依赖于任何东西。它在自己里面有自己的存在能力,这当然是一个奇迹。但那象征什么？象征神在最后对自己所说的。当摩西说,好吧,我应该对以色列说谁派我来？

换句话说,你的名字是什么？你知道神说什么吗？我告诉你我的名字是什么。他说,我是自有永有的。告诉他们,自有的派你来了。

现在实际上很难翻译这个。神真正给摩西的,实际上,作为他的名字,只是希伯来语的动词"是"。就好像他几乎在说,告诉他们存在本身派你来了。我是我所是的,我是自有永有的,但基本上是存在本身。这是他在说的。

我不依赖于任何东西。一切都依赖于我。我是自给自足的。我拥有所有存在的能力在我自己里面。我是所有存在的根基。

你知道,当圣经说神没有结束时,我想我们可以想象那个。但当圣经说神没有开始时,那就是我的大脑开始融化的地方。但它必须是,为什么？因为如果某物有开始,那是因为某物开始了它。如果神有开始,某物就会开始了神,无论那某物是什么,神就会依赖于它,但神在说,我不依赖于任何东西。

所有存在只在我里面有其存在。我在每个分子的核心。我把一切都维系在一起。希伯来书一章谈到这个。万有都是靠他而立的。

所以神在这里试图说的是,我是存在本身。我是存在本身。我是所有存在的根基。我不仅仅是一个存在者,我是存在。我不仅仅是一个存在者,我是存在。

我是自有永有的。耶稣用稍微更个人化的术语表达,离了他你不能做什么。现在这是我在这一点上试图说的。我们可以谈很多关于这个,这是神在这里启示的名字。但我试图向你展示的是,摩西正在拥有一个扩展的对神的理解。

他对神有一个看法,但这是什么？一般来说,当人们跟我谈论不能相信神时。一般来说,我可以问他们,好吧,告诉我你不相信什么,告诉我为什么很难相信神。他们总是描述为什么我不能相信一个做这个的神,我不能,而且五次中有四次,在他们告诉我他们不喜欢神什么以及为什么他们不能相信神之后。五次中有四次,我可以说,哦,这太好了。

我也不相信那个神。你所说的神不是我所相信的神,他们说什么？人们总是不相信的神是一个平面的神,一个简化论的神,一个简化的神。完全不像圣经中多维度丰富、丰富的神。圣经谈论神是这样的,但他也是这样的,他是这样的,但他也是这样的,矛盾的是他是这样的,他也是这样的,你对神的理解越简单,它就越可拒绝。

我会说得更进一步,你对神的理解越丰富和细腻,就越难拒绝他,越容易相信他。当然,越难只是完全拒绝他。摩西得到的是一个对神扩展的理解,你会,如果你正在扩展和理解神,并得到一个对神更丰富的理解,你正在朝正确的方向前进。所以他有一个打断的景象,他有一个扩展的概念。第三,有一个个人问题。

现在我所说的个人问题是什么意思？让我们回到火。神通过火传达了许多事情,这是其中之一。火既美丽又可怕。它既如此辉煌、如此吸引人,又如此危险、如此令人恐惧。

看。摩西说,我在这里,第5节,不要近前来,神说,当把你脚上的鞋脱下来,因为你所站之地是圣地。摩西蒙上脸,因为他怕看神。现在亚历克·莫提尔,伟大的旧约圣经学者,关于这节经文说,神的圣洁是神本性中对像你我这样的罪人来说危险的那部分。神的圣洁是神本性中对像你我这样的罪人来说危险的那部分。

只有我们听到这个,我们纽约人说,我想要一个慈爱的神,你是什么意思？危险？危险？他就像火。他美丽,但他危险。

我不认为我喜欢那个,但实际上,请跟我想一想。为什么神是危险的？为什么神的圣洁是他可怕的危险？嗯,首先两个原因。神的圣洁,首先,意味着他通过他的完美暴露我们。

来吧,你知道这个词,这是如何运作的。每当你在绝对的、令人难以置信的才华、美丽或智慧的面前,当你在拥有卓越的人面前,就像火一样。为什么？既美妙又可怕。看,你可能认为自己是个外表不错的人,然后有些人你不想站在他们附近,因为你不想让人们从你看到他或她。

你不想那样。你知道,你觉得我长得不算难看,然后你靠近某个让你看起来丑十倍的人,然后你感到丑陋。你可能认为自己有才华,你知道,这当然是真实的故事,这经常发生。你可能是德克萨斯州Hot Coffee小镇上最好的小提琴手,你知道,然后你在纽约市下火车,有人在乞讨,你知道,在中央车站,你知道,小提琴盒打开,人们往里面扔钱,他们在演奏,他们比你好得多。你说,哦不,发生了什么？

这很美。我的意思是,小提琴手很美。你说,好吧,这很美,技术,但你吓坏了。每当你进入比你好得多的东西的面前,既可怕又美妙。那么这对神来说怎么会是真的呢？

当然是这样的。这是你知道你正在接近真神的方式之一。当以赛亚进去看至圣者,高高在上,圣哉,圣哉,圣哉,他听到天使在说,他进入圣殿,他看到神的圣洁,你必须弄清楚。以赛亚,他是先知。以赛亚,与大多数人相比,他必须更有道德、更属灵、更有道德、比大多数人更好,但他对自己说什么？

不洁,他称自己。以赛亚引以为豪的一切看起来都像垃圾。因为在能力的面前,你感到你的软弱,在美的面前,你感到你的丑陋,在光的面前,你感到你的黑暗。因此神是危险的,因为他如此圣洁、如此完美、如此美丽,以至于他是可怕的。因为当你靠近他时,你有一场自我地震,你的自我形象崩溃了。

所有你告诉自己的事情,我不是一个那么坏的人,那不是真的。这不是真的,你意识到那不是真的。你所有的自我辩护,你所有的小自我欺骗,我们都有的盲目性。每个人都知道那个。我们总是有点,那个人很糟糕,那个人很糟糕,但我,你必须理解。

你总是为自己找借口,但在神的面前,这是令人难以置信的创伤。就像逻辑上绝对毁灭性的。这是令人难以置信的危险,因为神如此美丽,他是危险的。他向你展示你是谁。所以他的完美暴露你,但他也是一位积极良善的神。

积极和消极良善之间的区别,有很多研究表明,在德国大屠杀期间,大多数德国人对犹太人正在消失的事实感到难过。他们为此辩护。他们告诉自己,好吧,他们只是去拘留营,我的意思是,他们总是,他们对自己撒谎,所以他们不想承认,但基本上,大多数德国人看到犹太人只是在消失。他们看到犹太邻居只是在消失,他们对此感到难过。为什么？

人们,但他们是消极地良善。他们什么也没说。他们没有兴风作浪。他们害怕。正如我们都知道的,消极的良善不如积极的良善,而神是积极地良善。

神不仅仅是一般性地良善。他不容忍邪恶,他不容忍你里面的邪恶和罪。结果,有一种危险。现在这是第三点,非常重要。如果你要有一次神的经历,遇见神,它真的应该是一位真神。

我们如此受消费资本主义的影响,在消费资本主义中,我们选择一切。我们得到我们想要的。一切都为我们定制。所以你没看到我们倾向于做什么吗？我做这个。

你不能做吗？你得到你想要的神。你说,我不喜欢相信这样的神。我喜欢相信这样的神。我听到人们这样说。

我喜欢这样想神。我喜欢这样想神。如果你正在创造你自己的神,它只是你的延伸。那个人怎么能帮助你呢？那个人怎么能给你任何力量？

这只是你。那个人怎么能成为任何资源？这只是你。如果你实际上只是在创造你喜欢的神。那么你怎么能确定你正在接近一位真神,一个真实的属灵实在,一位真神,一位活神？

你怎么知道那个？乔纳森·爱德华兹,18世纪伟大的神学家哲学家说,神的大多数属性都是我们如果在创造一位神时会选择的属性。你知道,有一位强大的神会很好,因为如果他是你的神,那么他可以帮助你。有一位仁慈的神会很好,那么如果你有罪他可以原谅你。几乎所有的属性都是我们会选择的属性,但有一个属性我们永远不会选择,爱德华兹说,那就是神的圣洁,因为它只是一个问题。

圣洁只不过是一个问题,对我们来说是一个大问题,如果你开始感觉到你正试图理解的这位神是圣洁的,你不仅仅是一个需要他属灵提升的好人,你甚至不仅仅是一个需要满足的有需要的人,而是你是一个罪人,你需要宽恕和赦免。你开始真正感觉到有一个问题,你在进入他的面前有问题。现在你有一些信心,你没有编造这位神。现在你有一些信心,你正在通往真神的路上,因为你感觉到你有一个个人问题,他不仅仅是一个抽象概念,他只是在试图相信他,但你在与他建立关系方面有问题。这自然地把我们带到最后一件事,你需要的是某种恩典,你需要某种能让你站在神面前的东西。摩西在想这个。

在下面第11和12节,摩西说,但我是什么人,你会派我去见法老？然后神说,我必与你同在。但如果你继续阅读经文,你会看到摩西在这里并没有被改变。摩西说,等一下,你是圣洁的。他开始看到他是谁,他是什么样子,他开始说,我到底怎么？好吧这样说,荆棘没有被烧毁,但为什么摩西没有？在《出埃及记》33章,摩西实际上问神,我能面对面地看到你吗？神说不,你不能,那会杀了你。

那么为什么它在这里没有被烧毁？荆棘没有被烧毁,好的,那是个奇迹,但为什么摩西没有被烧毁？秘密和答案,就在经文中,但你可能直接跳过了它,我也是。看这里到处都是,它说神从荆棘中对摩西说话。神从荆棘中对摩西说话,神从荆棘中对摩西说话,但实际上谁在荆棘中？它在第2节告诉你,耶和华的使者。

等一下,你说那很奇怪,它说使者在荆棘中,但然后在经文的其余部分,它谈论好像神在荆棘中,是的,在旧约中就是这样运作的。有这个人物,这个谜一样的人物名叫耶和华的使者,不是耶和华的一个使者,像加百列或类似的人,是耶和华的使者,当耶和华的使者出现时,这很奇怪,因为一方面这位耶和华的使者似乎是一个与神不同的人,另一方面耶和华的使者似乎是神。就像它会说耶和华的使者对亚伯拉罕说话,或者耶和华的使者对摩西说话,但然后下一节经文会说,神对摩西说,神对亚伯拉罕说,就好像这个人既是神又不是神。但这里所有这些有趣的是,亚历克·莫提尔说,如果你仔细看,耶和华的使者出现在神想要接近某人而不毁灭他们时。最有趣的地方之一是后来在《出埃及记》中,莫提尔说在摩西和神之间有这个来回的争论,摩西说,主啊,当以色列人离开埃及前往应许之地时,你的同在必须与我们同在。你的同在必须与我们同在,神说不。

我的同在不能与你们同在,因为你们是叛逆的民,我的同在会毁灭你们。然后摩西反驳说不,不,除非你与我们同去,否则我不会去。然后最后神说,莫提尔在他的《出埃及记》注释中指出这一点。他最后说,等等,好的,我告诉你我要做什么。我会派我的使者与你们同去。

这是莫提尔对此的评论。他说耶和华的使者被启示为神的仁慈调节,借此当主自己与他们同去时,主可以在有罪的民中同在。神的同在会烧毁他们。所以使者是神的那种模式,借此圣洁的神可以与罪人保持同在而不毁灭他们。然后莫提尔继续说,那会是谁？

他说在圣经中只有一位既与主相同又与主不同。一位在肯定神的愤怒的同时又是他仁慈的至高显现。耶和华的使者只能被理解为耶稣基督道成肉身之前的显现。你还记得在《约翰福音》第8章,耶稣对他的听众说,还没有亚伯拉罕,就有了我。他没有说还没有亚伯拉罕,我就存在了。

那已经够奇怪的了。但他说还没有亚伯拉罕,就有了我。他在说什么？他在说,我就是从荆棘中对摩西说话的那一位。现在这是秘密。

这是所有谜题的答案。你说,好吧,耶稣基督怎么是耶和华的使者？耶稣基督怎么是我们能在神面前而不被烧毁的方式？哦我的天哪,就是这样。这就是你最终能看到神之火的方式。

火既可怕又美丽。在十字架上你看到神是多么可怕地圣洁。他是如此可怕地圣洁,以至于耶稣基督必须死。神是积极地良善。神必须对罪施行惩罚。

不能被轻描淡写。他是如此可怕地圣洁,耶稣必须死,但他是如此美丽地慈爱,如此美丽地慈爱,以至于在耶稣基督里他愿意来,并乐意死,愿意死,做他自己的赎罪。就是这样。我们有关于这个的赞美诗。一首赞美诗说,在宝座前我们被赦免而站立,你的爱已经满足了你的律法的要求。

可怕,恐怖,美丽,华丽,如果你想知道这位火焰般神的迷人美丽,一位如此圣洁以至于你与他有问题的神,然而又如此慈爱以至于他以自己的代价解决了问题。如果你说,我想认识那位神,你就会认识那位神,为什么？因为那就是在荆棘中向摩西显现的神,那就是向人们显现的神。你知道如果你那样做会发生什么吗？如果你相信耶稣基督,你将成为一丛燃烧的荆棘。

摩西做到了。摩西出去改变了世界。为什么？因为神的荣耀和美丽进入了他的生活。事实上,有一次他不得不在脸上蒙上面纱,它没有烧毁他。

为什么？好吧,他并不真正确定。他只是知道以某种方式赎罪已经做成了,但你和我知道。彼得前书一章第3节说,基督徒已经成为神性的分享者。以弗所书2章说,我们是圣灵的殿,不寻常的光和美丽以及神的荣耀可以进入你的生活,然而你不会被烧毁,因为耶稣基督的功德和中保,然后你成为一丛小小的燃烧荆棘。

你成为一个人们会过去看的人,去弄清楚,因为你是无法解释的。当你成为一个能够,能够触摸他人或让神通过你触摸他人的人,你可以改变世界,你相信在荆棘中向摩西显现的神吗？让我们祷告。父神,我们感谢你给我们这条通往你的经历的道路,我们祈求你现在帮助我们,甚至当我们参与圣餐时认识你。不是一位抽象的神,而是一位火焰般慈爱的神。我们祈求你帮助这里的每一位基督徒经历你的真实,以及这里每一位还不认识你的人也来经历那真实,我们奉耶稣的名祈求。

阿们。感谢你在《生命中的福音》播客中加入我们。我们希望今天的教导能鼓励你与你认识的某人分享福音。今年八月是《生命中的福音》的"去分享月",我们策划了广泛的免费资源来帮助你采取简单的步骤分享福音。你可以在gospelandlife.com斜杠share访问它们。

我们相信神使用小行动来做大事,我们邀请你在本月做简单的小行动来去分享福音,因为福音改变一切。今天的讲道录制于2013年。你在《生命中的福音》播客上听到的讲道和讲座录制于1989年至2017年间,当时凯勒博士是救赎主长老会的主任牧师。

欢迎来到生命中的福音。当谈到公开表达你的信仰时，你感到有多自在？本月在播客中，提姆·凯勒探讨圣经对于拥有公开信仰的教导。他向我们展示在多元化社会中公开我们的信仰是什么样子，以一种能够创造文明、和平以及与邻舍有意义对话的方式。今晚的经文选读来自出埃及记第三章第1至14节。

摩西牧养他岳父米甸祭司叶忒罗的羊群，他把羊群领到旷野的尽头，来到何烈，就是神的山。耶和华的使者从荆棘中的火焰里向他显现。摩西看见荆棘被火烧着，却没有烧毁。于是摩西想，我要过去看这奇异的景象，为什么荆棘没有烧毁。耶和华见他过去要看，神就从荆棘中呼叫他。

摩西，摩西，摩西说，我在这里。神说，不要靠近这里。把你脚上的鞋脱下来，因为你所站的地方是圣地。然后他说，我是你父亲的神，是亚伯拉罕的神，以撒的神，雅各的神。摩西因为怕看神，就蒙上脸。

耶和华说，我确实看见了我百姓在埃及所受的苦难。我听见他们因受督工的压迫而发出的哀声，我关心他们的痛苦。所以我下来要救他们脱离埃及人的手，领他们从那地出来，到美好宽阔的地方。那是流奶与蜜之地，就是迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人的家。现在以色列人的哀声已经达到我这里，我也看见埃及人怎样压迫他们。

所以现在去吧。我要差遣你到法老那里，把我的百姓以色列人从埃及领出来。但摩西对神说，我是什么人，竟能到法老那里去，把以色列人从埃及领出来呢？神说，我必与你同在。这就是我差遣你的凭据。

当你把百姓从埃及领出来之后，你们要在这座山上敬拜神。摩西对神说，假如

我去到以色列人那里对他们说，你们祖先的神差遣我到你们这里来，他们若问我，他的名叫什么？我要对他们说什么呢？神对摩西说，我是自有永有的。你要对以色列人这样说。

自有永有的差我到你们这里来。这是主的话语，感谢神。现在，我们每周都在探讨这样一个主题：我们如何在公共场合谈论我们最深层的信仰，我们如何分享我们的身份、我们深层的信仰，但要以一种尊重他人、促进和平的方式来分享。我这些年观察到，在公共场合讨论信仰的最佳方式之一，不是简单地谈论你相信什么，而是也要谈论你是如何相信的。不只是内容本身，还有你所经历的过程或旅程，你知道，不只是说"这就是我所相信的"，而是你如何开始相信你所相信的？你如何开始对你所信的神产生信心？

这是一个旅程的叙述，或者有些人会称之为个人见证，我认为这会降低紧张气氛，因为当你不只是说"这就是我所相信的"，不，这就是我所相信的，而是在谈论你如何通过这个过程和经历来到你的信仰时，我认为这会赢得某种尊重，你知道，你倾听别人对自己经历的叙述，我认为这通常也很有帮助，因为每个人都在一个过程中，听到你如何经历你的过程是有帮助的。因此，为了帮助我们思考如何去思考这个问题，我们正在看这段非常著名的经文，摩西与燃烧的荆棘，这真是太糟糕了，Leo和我刚才还在这里谈论，也许你们中的一些人属于那一代人，但我很难不想到查尔顿·赫斯顿，以及塞西尔·B·德米尔的声音或者不管是谁的声音从燃烧的荆棘中传出来，我是说，这非常著名，那是电影《十诫》，你们中的一些人以前常去大银幕上看这些电影，我知道，抱歉，这有点像古老的历史了，但实际上，这段叙述就在这里，我们今晚看它是因为这是摩西的归信经历。这是摩西的归信

经历。这就是为什么他不仅仅是开始相信神，他已经相信神了。

事实上，当神对他说话时，他说，看，我是你父亲的神，亚伯拉罕、以撒和雅各的神，当他说这话时，他是在说，我就是你所相信的那位神，实际上，我是你父亲的神，你父亲的神，他知道摩西相信这位神，他从未遇见过他，他从未有过面对面的经历，他没有见过他，因此可以说这是摩西的归信经历，所以如果我们看到他是如何不仅仅开始相信神，而是真正遇见神的，我们就会看到使他达到那一步的四件事，我认为圣经说，如果你也要遇见他，通常在你的生命中也必须发生同样的四件事。所以，如果摩西是这样遇见他的，我们也需要这四件事，通常，才能真正经历和遇见神，那么这四件事是什么呢？它们是：一个打断的异象，一个扩展的概念，一个个人的问题，和一个令人惊讶的恩典。好的，首先，一个打断的异象。使摩西真正遇见神的第一件事是荆棘本身，第二和第三节。

摩西看见荆棘虽然着火，却没有烧毁，所以摩西想，我要过去看看这个奇怪的异象，为什么荆棘没有被烧毁，没有烧尽。现在，摩西最初可能在这边某个距离看到了一场灌木火灾，但那并不是那么不寻常，在沙漠中有很多原因可以发生灌木火灾，但引起他注意的是这火没有熄灭，正如你可以想象的，灌木火灾很快，为什么？因为那里没有多少燃料，一丛灌木，或一些灌木并不是什么好燃料，所以那里确实因为闪电或其他任何原因发生的火灾，或者可能是其他一些路过的牧羊人留下了营火还在燃烧。如果你要有一场灌木火灾，它会很快熄灭，但显然这丛荆棘一直在燃烧，燃烧，燃烧，燃烧，我们被告知摩西决定，我最好去看看这是什么，为什么？因为那说不通，它不合理，那是不可能的，一丛荆棘必须

烧尽，我的意思是火焰吞噬了荆棘丛然后熄灭，为什么荆棘丛还在继续燃烧，为什么火焰还在继续燃烧，我们被告知他走过去，看，这个词用了两次，我要过去看看这奇异的景象，第4节说，主看见他已经过去了，这是一个希伯来词，意思是绕道，他让自己被打断，他的正常路径被打断了，好的，第一个原则是什么，这是第一个原则，通常情况下，除非有些事情进入你的生活，是你无法解释的并且扰乱了你的生活或扰乱了你的思维，往往是严重地扰乱和打断你，否则你不会遇见神，摩西看到的燃烧的荆棘丛不符合他对可能发生的事情的理解，因为它不符合，他就过去看它，弄清楚它，思考它等等，而我们通常不会仅仅通过思考就对神产生信仰，我们通常必须有一些事情进入我们的生活，打断我们，是我们无法解释的，使我们以前所未有的方式思考。

托马斯·库恩在20世纪中叶写了一本书，叫做《科学革命的结构》，解释了这一点，这是一本学术书籍，你可能没有听说过，然而你可能听说过，因为它非常有名，至少可能不是通过名字，库恩在写关于科学如何运作的，《科学革命的结构》，库恩试图，他是一位科学哲学家，科学史学家，他说，实际上科学并不是按照你倾向于说的方式前进的，科学家喜欢说，我是客观的，当我得到新的数据时，我看着它，如果我追随证据的指引，所以我在逐渐做出小的改变，我在获得更多证据，我在变得更清晰，我在根据证据改变我的观点，库恩说不，事情不是这样运作的。库恩说，我们都非常封闭，我们所有人，我们不对新证据开放，他说我们所有人都倾向于有解释性网格，通过它我们解释现实。现在网格就是他所说的范式，所以是的，实际上他，我认为，使范式这个术语流行起来，范式是一种

看待现实的方式。库恩说，我们确实有这些观点，这些解释框架，这些看待现实的方式，当新证据出现时，我们会尽一切努力使用这些证据来证实我们已经相信的东西。我们会尽一切努力把它纳入其中，现在我告诉你，对我来说，一个完美的例子就是9-11事件。

我们所有人都在看着同样可怕的事情发生，我们直接看着它，就在那里。但有些人的解释框架认为，美国是世界上的坏人。我们是物质主义和滥用权力的力量，无论如何，我们是世界上的坏人。而另一些人则说，美国是好人，我们是正义的力量，站在正义一边对抗邪恶。所以一旦认为美国是好人，一旦认为美国是坏人，令人惊讶的是，我读了人们在9-11后写的文章，我们看着完全相同的事情，每个人都用它来说，看，这就是我一直说的，这就是我一直相信的。

看9-11事件，这证明了我们是坏人，世界憎恨我们。看9-11事件，其他人说，这证明了我们是好人，我们有邪恶在与我们对抗。我们有两组不同的人，有两种不同的范式，它们彼此完全相反，他们看着同样的数据，并用它来支持这个范式。托马斯·库恩说，我们不是思想开放的人，我们有我们的一套信念，当一条数据出现时，我们用它来证实我们已经相信的东西，但库恩说，有时候一些东西进入我们的生活，这会产生摩擦。有时候一些东西进入我们的生活，我们无法真正在这个框架中解释它，它并不真正契合，很难把它纳入其中。

当然，库恩的例子，经典的例子是我们西方对太阳系的理解。库恩说，多年来，人们相信地球是固定的，地球在中心，还有所有这些其他天体围绕着它运行，当然这似乎可以解释。你抬头看天空，你可以看到其他天体在移动，我们说，当然，它们都在围绕我们运行，所以每次你

我们得到了一点新数据，我们发现了一颗新行星，我们发现了另一个，你知道的，天文学家发现了另一个天体，他们当然说这符合我们的框架，然后库恩说，开始发生的事情是我们在太空中看到的一些天体似乎不太符合。它们的运动似乎不太符合一切都围绕地球运行的这个想法。其中一些在天空中无限地像之字形移动，这似乎真的不太行得通。

库恩说，最终会发生的是足够多的数据进来，你无法解释，或者有些东西进来，你无法解释，这导致你质疑框架本身，你坐在那里说，哦，也许我搞错了，然后你尝试，就像试穿一件衣服，你试穿一个新的范式，你尝试别的东西，然后你说，好吧，也许地球也在运行。当你试穿那个范式时，突然间它解释了所有的数据，你经历了他所说的范式转换，这就像一种皈依，突然间你意识到如果我改变框架，那么突然间我就能解释其他一切，你经历了这种巨大的转变，所以他说基本上因为我们是如此封闭的思想，我们不会一点一点地移动，我们不会改变我们的观点，相反，我们试图把一切都纳入来确认我们现有的范式，直到有些东西进来，一个燃烧的荆棘，一些不符合的东西，一些你无法解释的东西，你尝试一种新的思维方式，它创造了一个转变，基本上是一种皈依。

现在，对于上帝来说通常就是这样，通常有些东西进入你的生活，它是一个燃烧的荆棘，你无法解释它。你有一套信念，要么你不相信上帝，要么你相信可能有一个上帝但没人知道，你要么有一个无关紧要的上帝，要么你没有上帝，或者类似的东西，一个你不需要认识就能生活的上帝，然后有些东西进入你的生活，你无法解释它。这可能是一连串的思考，我们在过去几周讨论过这个，你知道，奥登，二战期间住在上东区的人，伟大的英国诗人，不相信上帝，但二战来了，我们讨论过这个

在过去几周的时间里。

第二次世界大战来临时，WHO看到纳粹所做的事情，他说，等一下，如果没有上帝，我有什么权利说我的价值观是对的，而有错误的一方？如果没有上帝，我有什么依据说我是对的而他们是错的？于是他这样思考，如果没有上帝，所有道德都是相对的，但不，道德不是相对的，他们所做的是错的，因此必定有上帝。这个思路不符合他的认知框架，于是他经历了范式转变。他改变了认知，他质疑了框架本身，所以这可能是一种智识上的燃烧荆棘，一条思路，但很多时候是其他东西。

多年前当Redeemer刚开始的时候，我们只有几百人，你知道，实际上在早期，我是指头几年，这个团体大约就是Redeemer的规模，整个Redeemer。那是80年代末、90年代初，我们就是普通的纽约人，我们是在华尔街工作的人，在艺术界工作的人，你知道，在时尚界工作的人，就是普通的纽约人，但我常常发现如果你带一个人进来，普通人中有99.9%的人晚上不相信历史性的基督教或类似的东西。但如果他们进来，他们只是坐下来，然后意识到我们都相信历史性的基督教，他们在这里待了大约10到15分钟，就开始经历范式转变。Redeemer本身就是一个燃烧的荆棘，你知道为什么吗？因为在他们的认知框架中，像他们这样的人，上过同样学校的人，做同样工作的人，像他们这样的人不相信基督教，你看，这是不合常理的，没有人这样做，除了这里有几百人在这样做。

那我们该怎么办呢？突然间Redeemer本身有时就是一个燃烧的荆棘，你可以看到小小的范式崩溃，你知道，从他们耳朵里冒出来，你知道，范式，旧的范式，正在发生转变，他们无法完全解释那些人，你知道，我们并不杰出，我们只是普通人，而普通人没有这些

信念，你怎么能相信那个呢？或者有时候一个基督徒进入你的生活，也许你不是信徒，而这个基督徒比你想象中的基督徒更有智慧、更沉着、更聪明、更有思想，这个基督徒本身就像一丛燃烧的荆棘。在继续之前，还有一件事，那些令人幻灭和艰难的经历，它们往往就是燃烧的荆棘。它们进入你的生活，你会说，听着，我不知道有没有上帝，也许有，也许没有，我不需要认识上帝，这就是你的框架，这意味着你的假设是我能应付生活，我能应付生活，你知道，我很聪明，我很精明，你知道，我有，我有治疗师，你知道，我有朋友，你知道，我不笨，你知道，我知道生活不容易，但我能应付生活。

大卫·马丁·劳埃德-琼斯是一位医生，1920年代英国的一位年轻医生。他成为了基督徒，他归信了，之后进入了传道事工，但他讲述他的归信经历，其中很大一部分是这样的。他相信，嗯，其中很大一部分是这样的，一个他敬佩的人，一位年长的医生，是他想成为的那种人，你看，在那个年代，英国最优秀的医生，他们是英雄，他们被效仿，他们，你知道，他们拯救生命，他们受人尊敬，他们才华横溢，他们，他们收入丰厚，他们有巨大的地位，劳埃德-琼斯仰慕的就是这样一个人，想成为像他那样的人，他正在和一个女人约会，她死了，巨大的悲剧。他顺道来看劳埃德-琼斯，他说，嘿，我在这里待一会儿可以吗，劳埃德-琼斯说，哦，靠着火炉吧，那个人，劳埃德-琼斯说，那个人拉了一把椅子到火炉边坐下，盯着火看了两个小时，一句话也没说。他也表现得好像劳埃德-琼斯不在那里一样。

现在，劳埃德-琼斯并没有感到被伤害，他也不觉得那有任何不妥。那完全是恰当的，但当他看到他所仰慕的一个人，一个征服世界的人，一个他认为的那种人

想要成为的样子，他意识到这个人已经完全耗尽了资源。他一无所有。他没有任何东西可以真正面对生活中的正常现实。劳埃德-琼斯说，他看着他凝视着火焰，这就是他所说的话。

他说，我突然看到了一切人类伟大的虚空。我突然看到了一切人类伟大的虚空。那里发生了什么？在那个年轻人的脑海中，那是一个燃烧的荆棘。那是一些不合常理的东西。

他说，等一下，等一下，等一下，如果像这样的人都无法应对生活，我怎么会认为我可以在没有神的情况下应对生活呢？所以，但重点在这里。当这些事情进入你的生活，开始挑战你，开始让你质疑自己的认知框架时，你愿意走过去吗？就像摩西一样。你知道，如果摩西没有走过去，如果他真的说，我不想被打扰，我们就永远不会听说过摩西了。

你看，一旦你感到困扰，你就必须愿意把它想明白。你必须有勇气去思考它，并愿意把它想明白。我们总是说福音改变一切，我们真的相信它确实如此。这就是为什么在"福音与生命"，八月是"去分享月"。整个八月，我们邀请成千上万的听众迈出一小步，与神放在你生活中的某个人分享福音。

对于那些在本月向"福音与生命"捐赠的人，我们将送给你两本蒂姆·凯勒的《理解神》。这是一个强有力的资源，探讨了基督教如何在当今世界中在情感上、文化上和理性上都有意义。这是我们对您捐赠的感谢，并为您提供了一种通过与朋友一起阅读这本书、送给同事一本或将两本都传递给正在探索基督教信仰的人来分享福音的小行动方式。这是开始或继续福音对话的简单方式。要索取您的两本《理解神》，只需访问 gospelandlife.com/give。

再说一遍，那是 gospelandlife.com/give。现在，这里是凯勒博士今天教导的其余部分。芭芭拉·布朗·泰勒在她关于燃烧荆棘的著名讲道中说，想象一下如果摩西

只是耸起肩膀，低着头，一直忙着自己的事。如果摩西说，燃烧的荆棘？

我没真的看到。我不知道那是什么。燃烧的荆棘？嗯，可能有什么合理的解释吧。燃烧的荆棘。

我是被雇来看羊的，不是转过身去看荆棘的。燃烧的荆棘，有人能把它扑灭吗？如果他那样做了，你永远不会听说过他。他永远不会遇见神。神永远不会对他说话，同样的事也会发生在你身上。

他必须转过身去，明白吗？所以我打断了视线。第二和第三，它们有点联系在一起。第二和第三，如果你真的要遇见神，其次，你必须有一个不断扩展的神的概念。那么，我说的扩展概念是什么意思呢？

好吧，让我们看看神以火的形式显现自己这个概念。为什么神以火的形式显现自己？原因之一是他要传达圣经中关于神最令人震惊、最不可思议的事情之一。你看，摩西去看荆棘的原因是荆棘通常依赖于，我是说，对不起，火通常依赖于荆棘。它依赖于荆棘作为燃料。

因此，火不会永远燃烧，因为它们必须有燃料。在它们消耗完燃料后，它们就熄灭了。为什么？它们依赖于燃料。但这火不依赖于荆棘。

它不依赖于任何东西。它有自己内在的存在力量，这当然是一个神迹。但这象征着什么呢？它象征着神在最后对自己所说的话。当摩西说，那么我应该说是谁差我到以色列去呢？

换句话说，你的名字是什么？你知道神说什么吗？我告诉你我的名字是什么。他说，我是自有永有的。告诉他们，自有永有者差你去。

现在这实际上很难翻译。神真正给摩西的，作为他的名字，实际上只是希伯来语的动词"是"。这就像他几乎在说，告诉他们存在本身差你去。我是我所是的，我是我所是的，但基本上就是存在本身。这就是他在说的。

我不依赖于任何东西。一切都依赖于我。我是自足的。我拥有一切存在的力量在我自己里面。我是

万有的根基。

你知道，当圣经说上帝没有终结时，我想我们多少能够想象。但当圣经说上帝没有开始时，我的大脑就开始崩溃了。但必须如此，为什么？因为如果某样东西有开始，那是因为有什么使它开始。如果上帝有开始，就会有什么使上帝开始，而那个使上帝开始的东西，上帝就会依赖于它，但上帝说，我不依赖于任何东西。

所有的存在只在我里面才有其存在。我在每一个分子的核心。我维系着万有。希伯来书谈到这一点。万有都在他里面得以维系。

所以上帝在这里想说的是，我就是存在本身。我就是存有本身。我是万有的根基。我不只是一个存在者，我就是存在。我不只是一个存有，我就是存有。

我是自有永有的。耶稣用稍微更有位格性的话说，离了他你们什么都不能做。现在我在这里想说的是什么呢。我们可以对此谈论很多，这就是上帝在这里启示的名字。但我想向你展示的是，摩西对上帝的理解在不断扩展。

他对上帝有一个看法，但这是什么呢？一般来说，当人们跟我说他们无法相信上帝时。一般来说，我可以问他们，告诉我你不相信什么，告诉我为什么很难相信上帝。他们总是描述为什么我不能相信一个做这些事的上帝，我不能，而且五次中有四次，在他们告诉我他们不喜欢上帝什么以及为什么他们不能相信上帝之后。五次中有四次，我可以说，哦，这太好了。

我也不相信那个上帝。你说的那个上帝不是我所信的上帝，他们说什么？人们不相信的总是那个扁平的上帝，一个简化论的上帝，一个被缩减的上帝。完全不像圣经中那位多维度的、丰富的、丰富的上帝。圣经谈论上帝是这样的，但他也是这样，他是这样，但他也是这样，矛盾地说他是这样，他也是这样，你对上帝的理解越简单，就越容易被拒绝。

我甚至要说，你对上帝的理解越丰富、越细腻，

上帝，你越了解祂，就越难拒绝祂，也越容易相信祂。当然，也越难轻易地拒绝祂。摩西所得到的是对上帝不断扩展的理解，如果你也在扩展你对上帝的理解，并获得对上帝更丰富的认识，你就在朝着正确的方向前进。所以他有了一个颠覆性的一面，他有了一个扩展的概念。第三，有一个个人的问题。

现在我所说的个人问题是什么意思呢？让我们回到火的场景。上帝通过火要传达许多信息，这里是其中之一。火既美丽又可怕。它既辉煌又吸引人，同时又危险又令人恐惧。

看。摩西说，我在这里，第5节，不要再靠近了，上帝说，脱下你的鞋，因为你所站的地方是圣地。此时摩西遮住了他的脸，因为他害怕看上帝。现在，伟大的旧约圣经学者亚历克·莫蒂尔说，关于这节经文，上帝的圣洁是上帝本性中对像你我这样的罪人来说是危险的那部分。上帝的圣洁是上帝本性中对像你我这样的罪人来说是危险的那部分。

只有当我们听到这一点时，我们纽约人会说，我想要一个有爱的上帝，你说什么意思？危险？危险？祂就像火一样。祂是美丽的，但祂是危险的。

我不认为我喜欢这样，但实际上，请和我一起思考一下。为什么上帝是危险的？为什么上帝的圣洁是祂可怕的危险？好吧，首先有两个原因。上帝的圣洁，首先意味着祂通过祂的完美来暴露我们。

来吧，你知道这个词，这是如何运作的。每当你在绝对的、令人难以置信的才华、美丽或智慧面前，当你在一个拥有卓越品质的人面前时，这就像火一样。为什么？它既美妙又可怕。看，你可能认为自己长相还不错，但有些人你不想站在他们旁边，因为你不想让人们从你看向他或她。

你不想那样。你知道，你觉得我长相还不错，然后你靠近某个让你

比你好看十倍，然后你就感到自己又土又丑。你可能认为自己很有才华，你知道，这是一个真实的故事，当然，这种事经常发生。你可能是德克萨斯州热咖啡小镇上最好的小提琴手，你知道，小镇很小，你知道，然后你在纽约市下了火车，看到有人在乞讨，你知道，在中央车站，你知道，琴盒打开，人们往里扔钱，他们在演奏，而且比你强得多。你会想，哦不，发生什么了？

这很美妙。我是说，小提琴手很美妙。你说，嗯，那很美，技巧很好，但你被吓坏了。每当你置身于比你强得多的事物面前时，这既可怕又美妙。那么，对于神来说会是怎样呢？

当然是这样。这是你知道自己正在接近真神的方式之一。当以赛亚进去见至高者，被高举的圣者，圣哉，圣哉，圣哉，他听到天使在说，他进入圣殿，看到了神的圣洁，你就明白了。以赛亚，他是先知。以赛亚，与大多数人相比，他必定更有美德，更属灵，更有道德，是比大多数人更好的人，但他怎么说自己呢？

不洁净，他这样称呼自己。以赛亚所引以为傲的一切看起来都像垃圾。因为在能力面前，你感到自己的软弱；在美丽面前，你感到自己的丑陋；在光明面前，你感到自己的黑暗。因此神是危险的，因为他如此圣洁，如此完美，如此美丽，以至于令人恐惧。因为当你靠近他时，你会经历自我震荡，你的自我形象会崩塌。

所有你告诉自己的那些话——我不是那么坏的人——都不是真的。那就是不真实的，你意识到那不真实。你所有的自我辩护，你所有的小小自欺，我们都有的盲目。每个人都知道这一点。我们总是有点，那个人很可怕，那个人很可怕，但我呢，你得理解。

你总是在为自己找借口，但在神的面前，这是极其创伤性的。这在逻辑上是绝对毁灭性的。这是极其危险的，因为神

是如此美丽，祂是危险的。祂向你展示你是谁。所以祂的完美暴露了你，但祂也是一位主动行善的上帝。

主动善良和被动善良之间的区别，有很多研究表明，在德国大屠杀期间，大多数德国人对犹太人的消失感到难过。他们为此辩护。他们告诉自己，好吧，他们只是去了拘留营，我的意思是，他们总是，他们对自己撒谎，所以他们不想承认，但基本上，大多数德国人看到犹太人就这样消失了。他们看到犹太邻居就这样消失了，他们对此感到难过。为什么？

人们，但他们是被动的善良。他们什么也没说。他们没有制造波澜。他们害怕这样做。我们都知道，被动的善良不如主动的善良，而上帝是主动行善的。

上帝不仅仅是一般意义上的善良。祂不容忍邪恶，祂不容忍你身上的邪恶和罪恶。因此，这是有危险的。现在这是第三点，非常重要。如果你要有一个上帝的经历并遇见上帝，那真的应该是一位真正的上帝。

我们深受消费资本主义的影响，在消费资本主义中，我们选择一切。我们得到我们想要的。一切都为我们定制。所以你难道看不出我们倾向于做什么吗？我就这样做。

你难道不能这样做吗？你得到你想要的上帝。你说，我不喜欢像这样相信上帝。我喜欢像这样相信上帝。我听到人们这样说。

我喜欢这样想象上帝。我喜欢这样想象上帝。如果你在创造你自己的上帝，那只是你的延伸。那家伙怎么能对你有任何帮助呢？那家伙怎么能给你任何力量呢？

那只是你自己。那家伙怎么能成为任何资源呢？那只是你自己。如果你实际上只是在创造你喜欢的上帝。那么你怎么能确定你正在接近一位真正的上帝，一个真正的灵性实在，一位真实的上帝，一位活着的上帝？

你怎么知道呢？18世纪伟大的神学家哲学家乔纳森·爱德华兹说，上帝的大多数属性都是我们在创造上帝时会选择的属性。你知道，拥有一位强大的上帝会很好，因为如果祂

你的神，那么他就能帮助你。有一位仁慈的神会很好，那么如果你有罪，他可以赦免你。几乎所有的属性都是我们会选择的属性，但爱德华兹说，有一个属性是我们永远不会选择的，那就是神的圣洁，因为它就是一个问题。

这个圣洁对我们来说只是一个问题，一个大问题，如果你开始感觉到你正在努力理解的这位神是圣洁的，而你不只是一个需要从他那里得到属灵提升的好人，你甚至不只是一个需要满足的有需要的人，而是你是一个罪人，你需要赦免和饶恕。你开始真正感觉到有一个问题，当你来到他面前时你有一个问题。现在你有了一些信心，相信你不是在编造这位神。现在你有了一些信心，相信你正在走向真神的路上，因为你感觉到你有一个个人的问题，他不只是一个抽象概念，你不只是试图相信他，而是你在与他建立关系时遇到了问题，这自然就把我们带到最后一件你需要的事情上，你需要某种恩典，你需要某种东西能使你站在神的面前。摩西正在思考这个问题。

在这里的11节和12节，摩西说，但我是谁，你竟差遣我到法老那里去，然后神说，我必与你同在，但如果你继续读这段经文，你会看到摩西在这里并没有被修改。摩西说，等一下，你是圣洁的。他开始看到他是谁，他是什么样的，他开始说，我到底怎么能？这样说吧，荆棘没有被烧毁，但为什么摩西没有被烧毁？在出埃及记33章，摩西实际上问神，我能面对面见你吗？神说不，你不能，这会杀死你。

那么为什么这里没有被烧毁呢？荆棘没有被烧毁，好的，这是一个神迹，但为什么摩西没有被烧毁？这个秘密和答案就在经文中，但你可能直接略过了，我也是。看看这里的所有地方，它说神从荆棘中对摩西说话。神从荆棘中对摩西说话，神从荆棘中对摩西说话，但实际上谁在荆棘中呢？第2节告诉了你，是耶和华的使者

耶和华。

等一下,你说这很奇怪,经文说天使在荆棘丛中,但接下来的整段经文都说得好像神在荆棘丛中,是的,旧约就是这样运作的。有这样一个人物,这个神秘的人物叫做耶和华的使者,不是耶和华的一个使者,像加百列或类似的那种,而是"那位"耶和华的使者,当耶和华的使者出现时,很奇怪,因为一方面这位耶和华的使者似乎是与神不同的一个位格,另一方面耶和华的使者又似乎就是神。比如经文会说耶和华的使者对亚伯拉罕说话,或者耶和华的使者对摩西说话,但紧接着下一节经文又会说,神对摩西说,神对亚伯拉罕说,就好像这个人既是神又不是神。但这里非常有趣的是,亚历克·莫蒂尔说,如果你仔细观察,耶和华的使者出现是在神想要亲近某人而又不毁灭他们的时候。其中一个最有趣的地方是在出埃及记的后面,莫蒂尔说摩西和神之间有这样一段来回的争论,摩西说,主啊,你的同在必须与我们同去,当以色列人离开埃及前往应许之地时。

你的同在必须与我们同去,神说不行。我的同在不能与你们同去,因为你们是悖逆的百姓,我的同在会毁灭你们。然后摩西反驳说,不,不,除非你与我们同去,否则我不走,最后神说,莫蒂尔在他的出埃及记注释中指出了这一点。神最后说,等等,好吧,我告诉你我要做什么。我会差遣我的使者与你们同去。

莫蒂尔对此这样说。摩西说,我要你的同在。神说不行,那会毁灭你们。摩西说我要你的同在。好吧,我会差遣我的使者给你。

莫蒂尔在他的注释中这样说。他说耶和华的使者被启示为神的怜悯性调适,藉此耶和华可以住在有罪的百姓中间,而如果他亲自与他们同去的话。神的同在会吞灭他们。所以这位使者是神性的那种模式,藉此圣洁的神可以与罪人同行而不毁灭他们。

他们。然后马蒂尔接着说,那会是谁呢?

他说,在圣经中只有一位既与主相同又与主有别。一位在申明神的愤怒的同时却又是神怜悯的至高彰显。耶和华的使者只能被理解为耶稣基督道成肉身之前的显现。你还记得在约翰福音第8章,耶稣对他的听众说,还没有亚伯拉罕就有了我。他没有说在亚伯拉罕之前我曾经存在。

那样说已经够奇怪了。但他说的是还没有亚伯拉罕就有了我。他在说什么呢?他是说,我就是那位从荆棘丛中对摩西说话的那一位。现在这就是秘密所在。

这就是所有谜题的答案。你说,那么,耶稣基督如何成为耶和华的使者呢?耶稣基督如何成为我们能够来到神面前而不被烧灭的途径呢?哦,我的天哪,答案就在这里。这就是你最终能看见神之火的方式。

火既可怕又美丽。在十字架上,你看到神是何等可怕地圣洁。他是如此可怕地圣洁,以至于耶稣基督必须要死。神是主动良善的。神必须对罪施以惩罚。

这不能被轻易忽略。他是如此可怕地圣洁,耶稣必须要死,但他又是如此美好地慈爱,如此美好地慈爱,以至于在耶稣基督里,他愿意来并乐意死,愿意死,作成他自己的赎罪祭。就是这样。我们有赞美诗歌唱这个。一首赞美诗这样唱到,在宝座前我们得赦免站立,你的爱已满足,你律法的要求。

可怕的,恐怖的,美丽的,华美的,如果你想认识这位如火焰般的神令人陶醉的美,一位如此圣洁以至于你与他之间有问题、但又如此慈爱以至于他自己付出代价解决了这个问题的神。如果你说,我想认识那位神,你就会认识那位神,为什么?因为那就是在荆棘丛中向摩西启示自己的神,那就是向人启示自己的神。你猜如果你这样做会发生什么?如果你相信耶稣基督,你就会成为一个燃烧的荆棘丛。

摩西就是这样。摩西出去改变了世界。为什么?因为神的荣耀和美丽进入了他的生命。事实上,有一次他不得不在脸上蒙上帕子,而神的荣耀并没有烧灭他。

为什么呢？其实，他并不太确定。他只知道某种方式的赎罪已经完成了，但你我都知道。彼得前书1章3节说，基督徒已经与神的性情有份。以弗所书2章说，我们是圣灵的殿，神的光芒、非凡的光辉、美丽和荣耀能进入你的生命，而你却不会被吞灭，因为耶稣基督的功德和中保之工，然后你就成为了一个小小的燃烧的荆棘。

你就成为一个让人们过来观看的人，想要弄明白，因为你是无法解释的。当你成为一个能够触摸他人的人，或者让神通过你触摸他人，你就能改变世界，你相信那位向摩西显现在燃烧荆棘中的神与我们同在吗？让我们祷告吧。父啊，我们感谢你赐给我们这条经历你的道路，我们祈求你现在帮助我们，甚至当我们领受圣餐时能认识你。那不是一位抽象的神，而是一位火热慈爱的神。我们祷告求你帮助这里的每一位基督徒经历你的真实，也帮助这里每一位还不认识你的人也能来经历这一真实，我们奉耶稣的名祈求。
