Welcome to Gospel in Life. How comfortable are you when it comes to being open about your faith? This month on the podcast, Tim Keller looks at what the Bible says about having a public  faith. He shows us what it looks like to be open about our faith in a pluralistic society in a way  that creates civility and peace and meaningful dialogue with our neighbors. Tonight's scripture reading comes from Exodus, chapter 3, verses 1 through 14.

Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and  he led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horib, the mountain of God. There an angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that the bush was on fire and it did not burn up. So Moses thought, I will go over and see the strange sight why the bush does not burn  up. When the Lord saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush.

Moses, Moses, and Moses said, here I am. Do not come any closer, God said. Take off your sandals for the place where you are standing as holy ground. Then he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the  God of Jacob. At this Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at God.

The Lord said, I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers and I am concerned about their  suffering. So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and bring them up  out of that land into a good and spacious land. A land flowing with milk and honey, the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Parasites,  Hivites, and Jebysites. And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me and I have seen the way the Egyptians are  oppressing them.

So now go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt. But Moses said to God, who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out  of Egypt? And God said, I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you.

When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain. Moses said to God, suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, the God of your fathers has  sent me to you and they ask me, what is his name? Then what shall I tell them? God said to Moses, I am who I am. This is what you are to say to the Israelites.

I am has sent me to you. The word of the Lord, thanks be to God. Now, each week we are looking at the subject of how we can talk about our deepest faith  beliefs in public, how can we share who we are, our deep faith beliefs, but in such a  way that is respectful, promotes peace, and I have observed over the years that one  of the best ways of having a discussion about faith publicly is to not simply talk about  what you believe, but also how you came to believe it. Not just do the content, but the process or the journey that you went on, you know, it's  not just, here's what I believe, but how did you come to believe what you believe? How did you come to have faith in the God you have faith in?

It's a journey account, or some people would call it a personal testimony, and I think  it lowers the temperature, because when you're not just saying, here's what I believe,  no, here's what I believe, you're talking about the process and the experience by which  you came to your faith, I think it commands a certain respect, you know, you listen to  what person's account of their experience, I think it also very often is helpful because  everybody's on a process, and to hear how you went through your process is helpful. And so in order to help us think about how we can think about this, is we're looking  at this passage, which is very famous, Moses in the Burning Bush, there's an awful, Leo  and I were up here just talking about maybe some of you were on the generation, but it's  hard for me not to think of Charlton Heston, and Cecil B. DeMille's voice or whoever's  voice coming from the Burning Bush, I mean, it's a very famous, that was the movie Ten  Commandments, some of you movies you used to go and watch them on big screens and things  like that, I know it's sorry, it's kind of ancient history, but it's actually, this account  is here, and we're looking at it tonight because it's Moses' conversion experience. This is Moses' conversion experience. This is how he didn't just come to believe in God, he already believed in God.

In fact, when God speaks to him, he says, look, I'm the God of your father, the God of Abraham,  Isaac and Jacob, when he says that, he's saying, I'm the God you believe in, actually, I'm  the God of your father, the God of your father, he knows that Moses believes in this God,  he's never encountered him, he's never had a face-to-face experience with him, he hasn't  met him, and therefore it can be said that this is Moses' conversion experience, and so  if we see how he didn't come just to believe in God, but actually meet God, we're going  to see four things that brought him to that, and I think there's the same four things  that the Bible says you have to have usually happen in your life if you're going to meet  him as well. So, if Moses met him this way, we need these four things, usually, in order to actually  experience and meet God, what are those four things? They are a disrupting sight, an expanding concept, a personal problem, and a surprising  grace. Okay, so first, a disrupting sight. The first thing that brings Moses to actually meet God is the bush itself, verse two and  three.

Moses saw that though the bush was on fire, it did not burn up, so Moses thought, I will  go over and see this strange sight, why the bush is not consumed, does not burn up. Now, Moses probably originally saw a brush fire over here, some distance, but that wasn't  all that unusual, there's a lot of reasons why you can have brush fires in the desert,  but what caught his attention was this fire didn't go out, and as you can imagine, brush fires  are fast, why? Because there's no fuel out there, a bush, or some brush isn't much in the way of fuel,  so fires that do happen out there because of lightning or for other whatever reason, or  maybe some other shepherd who went by and left a campfire going. If you are going to have a brush fire, it goes out quickly, but evidently this bush kept  burning and burning and burning and burning, and we're told that Moses decided, I better  go see what this is, why? Because that doesn't make sense, it doesn't fit, that's impossible, a bush has to burn  out, I mean the fire consumes the bush and then it goes out, why is the bush continued  to burn, why is the fire continued to burn, and we're told he went over, see twice it  uses this word, I will go over and see this strange sight, verse 4, it says, the Lord  saw that he had gone over, that is a Hebrew word that means the detour, he let himself  be interrupted, his normal path was interrupted, okay, what's the first principle, here's the  first principle, ordinarily you don't meet God unless something comes into your life that  you can't account for and disrupts your life or disrupts your thinking, very often seriously  disrupts and interrupts you, what Moses saw the burning bush didn't fit his understanding  of what could happen, because it didn't fit, he went over to see it and figure it out  and consider it and so forth, and we usually do not come to faith in God, just simply by thinking  about it, we usually have to have something that comes into our life that disrupts us,  that we can't account for, and that makes us think in ways we didn't before.

Thomas Kuhn wrote a book in the mid 20th century called The Structure of Scientific Revolutions  which explains this, it's an academic book that you probably have not heard of and yet you  have probably because it was very famous, at least maybe not by name, Kuhn was writing  about how science works, the Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn tried, he was a philosopher  of science, historian of science, and he said, actually science does not move forward  the way you tend to say, scientists like to say, I'm objective and when I get a new bit  of data, I look at it, and if I follow the evidence wherever it leads and so I'm gradually  making small changes, I'm getting more evidence, I'm getting clear of you and I'm changing  my views in the court with the evidence, and Kuhn says now, that's not how it works. Kuhn says, we are very close minded, all of us, we are not open to new evidence and he says  all of us tend to have interpretive grids by which we interpret reality. Now a grid is what he called a paradigm, so yes, actually he, I think, popularized the term  paradigm, a paradigm is a way of looking at reality. And Kuhn says, we really have those views, these interpretive grids, these ways of looking  at reality, and when new evidence comes along we do everything we can to use that evidence  to confirm what we already believe. We do everything we can to work it in, now I'll tell you, one of the perfect, to me examples  of that was 9-11.

Here we all are all looking at the same horrible thing that happened, we're looking right  at it, there it is. But there were some people who had an interpretive grid that said, America is the bad guys  in the world. We're a force for materialism and abuse of power, whatever, we're the bad guys in the  world. And there was another people who said, America is the good guy, we're the force of good  on the side of good against evil. So once as America is a good guy, once as America is a bad guy, it's amazing, I read the essays  of people after 9-11, we were looking at the very same thing and everybody used it to  say, see, this is what I always said, this is what I always believed.

See 9-11, that proves that we're the bad guy, the world hates us. See 9-11, other people said, that proves that we're the good people and we have evil  on against us. We had two different groups of people with two different paradigms, they were totally  opposite to each other, they were looking at the same bit of data and using it to support  the paradigm. Thomas Koon says, we're not open-minded people, we have our set of beliefs and when a piece  of data comes, we use it to confirm what we already believe, except Koon says, sometimes  stuff comes into our lives that this rubs. Sometimes stuff comes into our lives that we can't really account for in the grid, it  doesn't really fit, it's difficult to work it in.

Koon's example, of course, the classic example was our Western understanding of the solar  system. Koon said, for years, people believed that the earth was fixed and the earth was in the  center and there were all these other bodies orbiting around it and of course that seemed  to explain. You looked up in the sky and you could see other bodies moving and we said, of course, they're  all orbiting around us and so every time you got a new bit of data, we found a new planet,  we found another, you know, the astronomers found another heavenly body, they said of course  that fits into the grid and then Koon says, what began to happen was some of the bodies  that we saw in space didn't seem to fit. Their movements didn't seem to work into this idea that everything was orbiting around  earth. Some of them kind of moved infinitely like zigzags in the sky and that didn't seem to  really work.

Koon says, what happens eventually is enough data comes in, you can't account for or something  comes in, you can't account for and it leads you to question the grid itself and you sit  there and say, oh, maybe I got it wrong and you try on, it's like trying on a dress,  you try on a new paradigm, you try something else on and you say, well, maybe the earth  is orbiting too. And when you try that paradigm on, suddenly it makes sense of all the data and you have  what he calls a paradigm shift, it's like a conversion, suddenly you realize if I change  the grid then suddenly I can explain everything else and you have this enormous shift so  he says basically because we're so close-minded, we do not move, we don't change our bodies  little by little, instead we try to work everything into confirm our existing paradigms  until something comes in a burning bush, something that doesn't fit, something you can't  account for, you try on a new way of thinking and it creates a shift, basically a kind  of conversion. Now, that's how it is with God, usually, usually something comes into your life, it's  a burning bush and you can't account for it. You've got to set a belief, either you don't believe in God or you believe whether  probably is a God but nobody knows, you either have an inconsequential God or you have  no God or something like that, a God that you don't need to know in order to live life  and then something comes into your life and you can't account for it. It could be a train of thought, we've talked about this in the last couple of weeks, you  know, WHO, who lived here in the Upper East Side in World War II, Great British Poet, didn't  believe in God, but World War II came, we talked about this at length in the last couple  of weeks.

World War II comes along, WHO sees the Nazis what they're doing and he says, wait a minute,  there's no God, what right do I have to say that my values are right and there's a wrong? If there's no God, what warrant do I have for saying I'm right and they're wrong? And so he's thought like this, if there's no God, all morality is relative but no, morality  is not relative, what they're doing is wrong and therefore there must be a God. The train of thought came along that didn't fit in to his grid and he had a paradigm shift. He had a change in it, he questioned the grid itself so it can be kind of an intellectual  burning bush, a train of thought, but very often it's something else.

Years ago when Redeemer got started and we had a few hundred people, you know, actually  in the early days, I mean the first couple of years, this body was about the size of  Redeemer, the whole of Redeemer. And we were, this is the late 80s, early 90s and we were just normal New Yorkers, we were  people who worked in Wall Street, worked in the arts, you know, worked in fashion, just  normal New Yorkers, but I used to find that if you brought a person in, the average man  had 99.9% of the average man had nights didn't believe in historic Christianity or anything  like that. But if they came in and they just sat down and they realized we all believed in historic  Christianity, they were here for about 10 or 15 minutes, they started having paradigm shifts. Redeemer itself was a burning bush, you know why? Because in their grid, people like them, people who'd gone to the same schools, people  who did the same jobs, people like them didn't believe in Christianity, see, it was just  not done, nobody did it except here's a few hundred people that were doing it.

So what are we going to do about that? And suddenly Redeemer itself sometimes was a burning bush, you could just see little  paradigm meltdowns, you know, it was coming out of their ears, you know, the paradigm,  the old paradigm, there was a shift going on, they couldn't quite account for people  that were, you know, we weren't brilliant, we're just normal, and normal people don't have  these beliefs, how could you believe that? Or sometimes a Christian comes into your life and maybe you're not a believer, and  the Christian is just so much more wise or so much more poised or so much more intelligent  and we're so much more thoughtful than you thought Christians could be and the Christian  itself is like a burning bush. We're very often, one more thing before going on, very often disillusioning and difficult  experiences, very often they're the burning bush. They come into your life and you're saying, look, I don't know if there's a God, there  might be, there might not, I don't need to know God, that's your grid, which means your  assumption is I can handle life, I can handle life, you know, I'm smart, I'm savvy,  you know, I've got, I've got a therapist, you know, I've got friends, you know, I'm  not stupid, you know, I know life isn't easy but I can handle life.

David Martin Lloyd-Jones was a physician, a young physician in Britain in the 1920s. He became a Christian, he got converted and went into the ministry after that, but he  tells about his conversion and a big part of it was this. He believed, well, a big part of it was this, a man that he admired, an older man who  was a physician and everything he wanted to be, you see, in that day and time, the best  physicians in Britain, they were heroes, they were emulated, they were, you know, they  were saving lives, they were respected, they were brilliant, they were, they were well paid,  they had enormous status and it was one of those men that Lloyd-Jones looked up to and  wanted to be like, he was dating a woman and she died, great tragedy. He came by to see Lloyd-Jones and he says, hey, it'd be okay if I stayed here for a little  bit and Lloyd-Jones says, oh, it's up to the fire and the man, Lloyd-Jones says, the man  pulled up a chair to the fire and sat down and stared at the fire for two hours, didn't  say a word. He also didn't act as if Lloyd-Jones was there.

Now, Lloyd-Jones did not have his feelings hurt and he didn't feel, in any way, that  was inappropriate. It was perfectly appropriate but when he saw one of the men, that he, a world-beater,  a person that he thought, that he wanted to be like and he realized this man was absolutely  out of resources. He had nothing left. He had nothing with which to actually face the normal realities of life. And Lloyd-Jones says, he looked at him staring at the fire and this is what he said.

He says, I suddenly saw the vanity of all human greatness. I suddenly saw the vanity of all human greatness. What was going on there? In that young man's mind, it was a burning bush. It was something that didn't fit.

He says, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, if a guy like this can't handle  life, how in the world do I think I can handle life without God? So, but here's the point. When these things come into your life and they start to challenge you and they start  to make you question the grid, are you willing to go over? Like Moses. You know, if Moses hadn't gone over, if he actually said, I don't want to be bothered,  he would have never heard of Moses.

See, once you get bothered, you have to be willing to think it out. You have to have the guts to think it out and be willing to think it out. We always say the gospel changes everything and we believe it really does. That's why here at Gospel and Life, August is Go and Share Month. Throughout August, we're inviting thousands of our listeners to take a small step in  sharing the gospel with someone God has placed in your life.

For those of you who make a gift to Gospel and Life this month, we'll send you two copies  of making sense of God by Tim Keller. It's a powerful resource that explores how Christianity makes emotional, cultural, and  rational sense in today's world. It's our thanks for your gift and provides a way you can do a small act to share the gospel  by reading the book with a friend, giving one to a coworker or passing on both copies  to people who are exploring the Christian faith. It's a simple way to start a gospel conversation or continue it. To request your two copies of making sense of God, simply go to gospelandlife.com-slash-give.

Again, that's gospelandlife.com-slash-give. Now, here's Dr. Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. Barbara Brown Taylor, in her famous sermon on the burning bush, says, imagine if Moses  had just hunched down over his shoulders and kept his head down and just stayed busy. What if Moses had said, burning bush?

I didn't really see it. I don't know what that is. Burning bush? Well, probably there's some rational explanation anyway. Burning bush.

I've been paid to watch sheep, not turn aside and look at bushes. Burning bush, would somebody please put that out? If he had done that, you never would have heard of him. He would never met God. God would never have spoken to him and the same thing would happen to you.

He got to turn aside, okay? So I disrupting sight. Second and third, they kind of go together. Second and third, if you're really going to meet God, secondly, you have to have an expanding  concept of God. Now, what do I mean by expanding concept?

Well, let's look at this idea of God revealing himself as fire. Why does God reveal himself as fire? One of the reasons is he's getting across one of the most mind-numbing, amazing things  that the Bible says about God. See, the reason Moses went to see the bush was bushes are usually dependent on the,  I mean, pardon me, fire is usually dependent on the bush. It's dependent on the bush for fuel.

And therefore, fires don't stay going forever because they have to have fuel. And after they consume the fuel, they're gone. Why? They're dependent on the fuel. But this fire wasn't dependent on the bush.

It wasn't dependent on anything. It had its own power of being within it, which of course was a miracle. But what is that symbolized? And symbolizes what God says about himself at the very end. When Moses says, well, who should I say has sent me to Israel?

What's your name in other words? And you know what God says? I'll tell you what my name is. He says, I am who I am. Tell them, I am has sent you.

Now it's actually really hard to translate this. What God really gives Moses, actually, as his name, is just the Hebrew verb to be. It's like he's almost saying, tell them being itself sent you. I am what I am, I am who I am, but basically being itself. And here's what he's saying.

I depend on nothing. Everything depends on me. I am self-sufficient. I have the power of all being in myself. I am the ground of all being.

You know, when the Bible says God has no ending, we can kind of imagine that, I guess. But when the Bible says God has no beginning, that's where my brain starts to melt. But it has to be, why? Because if something has a beginning, it's because something begins it. And if God had a beginning and something would have begun God, and whatever that something  was, God would have been dependent on, but God is saying, I am dependent on nothing.

All existence has its existence only in me. I'm at the heart of every molecule. I'm holding everything together. Hebrew is one one talks about that. In him, all things consist.

And so what God is trying to say here is that I am existence itself. I am being itself. I'm the ground of all being. I'm not just a being, I am being. I'm not just a being, I am being.

I am that I am. Jesus put it slightly more personal terms without him you can do nothing. Now here's what I'm trying to say at this point. We could talk a lot about this, and this is the name that God reveals here. But what I'm trying to show you is this, Moses is having an expanding understanding of  God.

He had a view of God, but what is this? In general, when people talk to me about not being able to believe in God. In general, I can ask them, well tell me what you don't believe in, and tell me why  it's hard to believe in God. And they always describe why I can't believe in a God who does this, I can't, and it's  I'd say four times out of five, after they tell me what they don't like about God and  why they can't believe in God. Four times out of five, I can say, oh, this is great.

I don't believe in that God either. The God you're talking about is not the God I believe in, they say what? That's always the God that people disbelieve in is a flat God, a reductionist to God, a reduced  God. Nothing like the multi-dimensional rich, rich God of the Bible. The Bible's talking about God is this, but he's also this, he's this, but he's also this,  and paradoxically he's this, and he's also this, and the simpler your understanding of God  is, the more rejectable it is.

And I'll go so far as to say, the richer and more nuanced your understanding of God,  the harder it is to reject him and the easier it is to believe in him. Certainly, the harder it is to just reject him out of hand. And what Moses was getting is an expanding understanding of God, and you will, if you're  expanding and you're understanding of God, and getting a richer understanding of God,  you're moving in the right direction. So he had a disrupting side, he had an expanding concept. Thirdly, there was a personal problem.

Now what do I mean by personal problem? Let's go back to the fire. There are a number of things that God was getting across with fire, and here's one of them. Fire is so beautiful and so scary at once. It is so brilliant and so attractive and so dangerous and so frightening at once.

Look. Moses said, here I am, verse 5, do not come any closer, God said, take off your sandals  for the place where you were standing is holy ground. At this Moses hit his face because he was afraid to look at God. Now Alec Matier, great Old Testament Bible scholar, says about this verse, that the holiness  of God is that part of God's nature that is dangerous for sinners like you and me. The holiness of God is that part of God's nature that is dangerous to sinners like  you and me.

And only we hear that, we New Yorkers say, I want a loving God, what do you mean? Dangerous? Dangerous? He's like fire. He's beautiful, but he's dangerous.

I don't think I like that, but actually, please think with me a little bit. Why is God dangerous? Why is the holiness of God his terrifying danger? Well, first two reasons. The holiness of God, first of all, means he exposes us through his perfection.

Come on, you know what this word, how this works. Whenever you're in the presence of absolute, incredible talent or beauty or brilliance,  when you're in the presence of a human being with excellence, it's just like fire. Why? It's wonderful and it's horrible. Look, you may think of yourself as not too bad looking person, then there's some people  you don't want to stand near them because you don't want people looking from you to him  or to her.

You don't want that. You know, you feel like I'm not so bad looking and then you get near somebody who makes  you ten times better looking and then you feel homely ugly. You may think of yourself as talented, you know, this is one of the true story, of course,  is that it happens very often. You may be the best violinist in hot coffee, Texas, little town, you know, and you get  off the train in New York City and there's somebody begging, you know, and grand social  station, you know, with a violin case open and people throw money in, they're playing  and they're way better than you. And you go, oh no, what's happening?

It's beautiful. I mean, violinist is beautiful. You say, well, that's beautiful, the technique, but you're scared to death. Whenever you get into the presence of something way better than you, it's horrible and wonderful. Well, how would that be true of God?

Of course it is. And this is one of the ways you know you're drawing near to the real God. When Isaiah went in to see the Holy One, high and lifted up, holy, holy, holy, he heard  the angel saying, he went into the temple and he saw the holiness of God and you've got  a figure. Isaiah, he's a prophet. Isaiah, compared to the most of the population, he would have to be more virtuous, more spiritual,  more moral, a better person than most, but what does he say about himself?

Unclean, he calls himself. Everything that Isaiah was proud of looked like trash. Because in the presence of power, you feel your weakness in the presence of beauty, you feel  your ugliness in the presence of light, you feel your darkness. And therefore God's dangerous because he is so holy and so perfect and so beautiful  that he's horrible. Because when you get near him, you have a self-quake, your self-image falls apart.

All the things you tell yourself, I'm not that bad a person, it's not true. It's just not true and you realize it's not true. All your self-justifications, all your little self-deceptions, the blindness we all have. Everybody knows that. We always sort of, that person is awful, that person is awful, but me, you have to understand.

You're always making excuses for yourself, but in the presence of God, it's incredibly traumatic. It's like a logically absolutely devastating. It's incredibly dangerous because God is so beautiful, He is dangerous. He shows you who you are. So His perfection exposes you, but also He is a God of active goodness.

The difference between active and passive goodness, there's been a lot of studies  that during the Holocaust in Germany, most Germans felt bad about the fact that the Jews  were disappearing. They justified it. They told themselves, well, they're just going to detention camps, I mean, they always,  they lied to themselves so they didn't want to admit, but basically, most Germans saw  the Jews just disappearing. They saw the Jewish neighbors just disappearing and they felt bad about it. Why?

People, but they're passively good. They didn't say anything. They didn't make waves. They were afraid to. As we all know, passive goodness isn't as good as active goodness and God is actively  good.

God is not just good in general. He doesn't tolerate evil, He doesn't tolerate evil in sin in you. And as a result, there's a danger. Now here's the third point, very important. If you're going to have an experience of God and counter God, it really ought to be a real God.

We are so affected by consumer capitalism and in consumer capitalism, we choose everything. We get what we want. Everything's customized to us. And so you don't you see what we tend to do? I do it.

Can't you do it? You get the God you want. You say, I don't like to believe in God like this. I like to believe in God like this. I hear people say this.

I like to think of God like this. I like to think of God like this. If you're creating your own God, it's just an extension of you. How's that guy going to be of any help to you? How's that guy going to give you any power?

It's just you. How's that guy going to be any resource? It's just you. If you're actually just creating God you like. So how are you going to be sure that you're drawing near to a real God, a real spiritual reality,  a true God, a living God?

How are you going to know that? And Jonathan Edwards, the great 18th century theologian philosopher says that most of the  attributes of God are attributes that we would choose if we were creating a God. You know, it'd be nice to have a powerful God because then if he's your God, then he  can help you. It'd be nice to have a merciful God, then if you're guilty he can forgive you. Almost all the attributes are attributes that we would choose, but there's one attribute  we would never choose, Edwards says, it's the holiness of God because it's just a problem.

The holiness is nothing but a problem, a big problem for us and if you are starting to  sense that this God that you're trying to come to grips with is holy and that you're  not just a good person who needs a spiritual boost from him and you're not just even a  needy person who needs fulfillment but that you're a sinner and you need forgiveness  and pardon. And you begin to actually sense that there's a problem and you've got a problem coming  into his presence. Now you have some confidence that you're not making this God up. Now you've got some confidence that you're on your way toward the real God because you  sense that you've got a personal problem, he's not just an abstraction, he's just trying  to believe in him but you've got a problem in relating to him and that brings us naturally  then the last thing you need would be you need some kind of grace, you need something  that will enable you to stand in God's presence. Moses is wondering about that.

Down here in verse 11 and 12, Moses says, but who am I that you would send me to Pharaoh  and then God says, I will be with you but if you go on in the text, you'll see Moses  is not modified here. Moses says, wait a minute, you're holy. He's starting to see who he is, what he's like and he begins to say, how in the world  am I? Well put it like this, the bush is not consumed but why isn't Moses? In Exodus 33, Moses actually asked God, can I see you face to face and God says no, you  can't, it will kill you.

Well then why is it not consumed right here? The bush isn't consumed, okay, it was a miracle but why isn't Moses consumed and the secret  and the answer, it's in the text but you probably went right by it, I do. Look all through here, it says God spoke to Moses out of the bush. God spoke to Moses out of the bush, God spoke to Moses out of the bush but who's actually  in the bush? It tells you in verse 2, the angel of the Lord.

Wait a minute you say that's weird, it says the angel was in the bush but then all the  way through the rest of the text it talks as if God's in the bush, yes, that's the way  it works in the Old Testament. There's this figure, this enigmatic figure named the angel of the Lord, not an angel of  the Lord, like Gabriel or somebody like that, the angel of the Lord and when the angel of  the Lord shows up, it's weird because on the one hand this angel of the Lord seems to be  a distinct person from God, on the other hand the angel of the Lord seems to be God. Like it'll say the angel of the Lord spoke to Abraham or the angel of the Lord spoke  to Moses but then the very next verse it'll say and God said to Moses and God said  Abraham, it's almost as if this person is both God and not God. But here's what's all so interesting, Alec Matier says, if you look carefully, the angel  of the Lord shows up when God wants to draw near to someone without destroying them. One of the most interesting spots is later on in the book of Exodus, Matier says there's  this argument going back and forth between Moses and God and Moses says, Lord, you must  your presence must go with us as the children of Israel leave Egypt and go toward the promised  line.

Your presence must go with us and God says no. My presence cannot go with you because you are rebellious people and my presence will  destroy you. And then Moses pushes back and says no, no, I'm not going to go unless you go with us and  then finally God says, Matier points this out in his commentary on Exodus. He finally says, wait, okay, I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'll send my angel with you.

And here's what Matier says about that. Moses says, I want your presence. God says no, it'll destroy you. Most I want your presence. Okay, I'll send you my angel.

And here's what Matier says in his commentary. He says the angel of the Lord is revealed as the merciful accommodation of God whereby  the Lord can be present among a sinful people when were he to go with them himself. God's presence would consume them. So the angel is that mode of deity whereby the holy God can keep company with sinners  without destroying them. And then Matier goes on and says, who would that be?

He says there is only one other in the Bible who is both identical with and yet distinct  from the Lord. One who while affirming the wrath of God is yet a supreme display of his mercy. The angel of the Lord can only be understood as a pre-incarnate appearance of Jesus Christ. And do you remember in John chapter 8, Jesus says to his listeners, before Abraham was  I am. He doesn't say before Abraham was I was.

That would have been weird enough. But he says before Abraham was I am. And what is he saying? He's saying, I'm the one who spoke to Moses from the bush. And now here's the secret.

Here's the answer to all the riddles. You say, well, how is Jesus Christ the angel of the Lord? How is Jesus Christ the way that we can be in the presence of God without being consumed? Oh my goodness, here it is. Here's how you can finally see the fire of God.

Fire is terrible and beautiful. And on the cross you see how terribly holy God is. He is so terribly holy that Jesus Christ had to die. God is actively good. God has to meet out punishment on sin.

Just can't be shrugged at. He is so terribly holy, Jesus had to die, but he is so beautifully loving, so beautifully  loving that in Jesus Christ he was willing to come and glad to die, willing to die, make  his own atonement. And there it is. We have hymns about this. One hymn goes, before the throne absolved we stand, thy love has met, thy laws demand.

Terrible, horrible, beautiful, gorgeous, and if you want to know the ravishing beauty of  this fiery God, a God who wants so holy that you got a problem with him and yet so loving  that he solved the problem at his own expense. If you say, I want to know that God, you will come to know that God, why? Because that's the God who reveals himself to Moses in the bush and that's the God who  reveals himself to people. And guess what will happen if you do that? If you believe in Jesus Christ, you will become a burning bush.

Moses did. Moses went out and changed the world. Why? Because the glory and the beauty of God came into his life. In fact, at one point he had to put a veil over his face and it didn't consume him.

Why? Well, he wasn't really sure. He just knew that somehow atonement had been made, but you and I know. Peter 1, verse 3 says, the Christians have been made partakers of the divine nature. Ephesians 2 says, we're temples of the Holy Spirit, the light and the uncommon light and  the beauty and the glory of God can come into your life and yet you not be consumed because  of the merits and mediation of Jesus Christ and then you become a little burning bush.

And you become someone who can, who people go over to see, to figure out because you're  inexplicable. When you become someone who can touch others or have God touch others through you and  you can change the world, do you believe in the God who revealed Himself to Moses and  the burning bush with us pray? Father, we thank you for giving us this pathway to experience of you and we ask that you  would help us now even as we participate in the Lord's Supper to know you. That is an abstract God but is a fiery loving God. We pray that you would help every Christian here experience your reality and everyone  here who is not yet know you also come to experience that reality we ask it in Jesus'  name.

### English Transcript (for reference)

Welcome to Gospel in Life. How comfortable are you when it comes to being open about your faith? This month on the podcast, Tim Keller looks at what the Bible says about having a public  faith. He shows us what it looks like to be open about our faith in a pluralistic society in a way  that creates civility and peace and meaningful dialogue with our neighbors. Tonight's scripture reading comes from Exodus, chapter 3, verses 1 through 14.

Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and  he led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horib, the mountain of God. There an angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that the bush was on fire and it did not burn up. So Moses thought, I will go over and see the strange sight why the bush does not burn  up. When the Lord saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush.

Moses, Moses, and Moses said, here I am. Do not come any closer, God said. Take off your sandals for the place where you are standing as holy ground. Then he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the  God of Jacob. At this Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at God.

The Lord said, I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers and I am concerned about their  suffering. So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and bring them up  out of that land into a good and spacious land. A land flowing with milk and honey, the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Parasites,  Hivites, and Jebysites. And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me and I have seen the way the Egyptians are  oppressing them.

So now go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt. But Moses said to God, who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out  of Egypt? And God said, I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you.

When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain. Moses said to God, suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, the God of your fathers has  sent me to you and they ask me, what is his name? Then what shall I tell them? God said to Moses, I am who I am. This is what you are to say to the Israelites.

I am has sent me to you. The word of the Lord, thanks be to God. Now, each week we are looking at the subject of how we can talk about our deepest faith  beliefs in public, how can we share who we are, our deep faith beliefs, but in such a  way that is respectful, promotes peace, and I have observed over the years that one  of the best ways of having a discussion about faith publicly is to not simply talk about  what you believe, but also how you came to believe it. Not just do the content, but the process or the journey that you went on, you know, it's  not just, here's what I believe, but how did you come to believe what you believe? How did you come to have faith in the God you have faith in?

It's a journey account, or some people would call it a personal testimony, and I think  it lowers the temperature, because when you're not just saying, here's what I believe,  no, here's what I believe, you're talking about the process and the experience by which  you came to your faith, I think it commands a certain respect, you know, you listen to  what person's account of their experience, I think it also very often is helpful because  everybody's on a process, and to hear how you went through your process is helpful. And so in order to help us think about how we can think about this, is we're looking  at this passage, which is very famous, Moses in the Burning Bush, there's an awful, Leo  and I were up here just talking about maybe some of you were on the generation, but it's  hard for me not to think of Charlton Heston, and Cecil B. DeMille's voice or whoever's  voice coming from the Burning Bush, I mean, it's a very famous, that was the movie Ten  Commandments, some of you movies you used to go and watch them on big screens and things  like that, I know it's sorry, it's kind of ancient history, but it's actually, this account  is here, and we're looking at it tonight because it's Moses' conversion experience. This is Moses' conversion experience. This is how he didn't just come to believe in God, he already believed in God.

In fact, when God speaks to him, he says, look, I'm the God of your father, the God of Abraham,  Isaac and Jacob, when he says that, he's saying, I'm the God you believe in, actually, I'm  the God of your father, the God of your father, he knows that Moses believes in this God,  he's never encountered him, he's never had a face-to-face experience with him, he hasn't  met him, and therefore it can be said that this is Moses' conversion experience, and so  if we see how he didn't come just to believe in God, but actually meet God, we're going  to see four things that brought him to that, and I think there's the same four things  that the Bible says you have to have usually happen in your life if you're going to meet  him as well. So, if Moses met him this way, we need these four things, usually, in order to actually  experience and meet God, what are those four things? They are a disrupting sight, an expanding concept, a personal problem, and a surprising  grace. Okay, so first, a disrupting sight. The first thing that brings Moses to actually meet God is the bush itself, verse two and  three.

Moses saw that though the bush was on fire, it did not burn up, so Moses thought, I will  go over and see this strange sight, why the bush is not consumed, does not burn up. Now, Moses probably originally saw a brush fire over here, some distance, but that wasn't  all that unusual, there's a lot of reasons why you can have brush fires in the desert,  but what caught his attention was this fire didn't go out, and as you can imagine, brush fires  are fast, why? Because there's no fuel out there, a bush, or some brush isn't much in the way of fuel,  so fires that do happen out there because of lightning or for other whatever reason, or  maybe some other shepherd who went by and left a campfire going. If you are going to have a brush fire, it goes out quickly, but evidently this bush kept  burning and burning and burning and burning, and we're told that Moses decided, I better  go see what this is, why? Because that doesn't make sense, it doesn't fit, that's impossible, a bush has to burn  out, I mean the fire consumes the bush and then it goes out, why is the bush continued  to burn, why is the fire continued to burn, and we're told he went over, see twice it  uses this word, I will go over and see this strange sight, verse 4, it says, the Lord  saw that he had gone over, that is a Hebrew word that means the detour, he let himself  be interrupted, his normal path was interrupted, okay, what's the first principle, here's the  first principle, ordinarily you don't meet God unless something comes into your life that  you can't account for and disrupts your life or disrupts your thinking, very often seriously  disrupts and interrupts you, what Moses saw the burning bush didn't fit his understanding  of what could happen, because it didn't fit, he went over to see it and figure it out  and consider it and so forth, and we usually do not come to faith in God, just simply by thinking  about it, we usually have to have something that comes into our life that disrupts us,  that we can't account for, and that makes us think in ways we didn't before.

Thomas Kuhn wrote a book in the mid 20th century called The Structure of Scientific Revolutions  which explains this, it's an academic book that you probably have not heard of and yet you  have probably because it was very famous, at least maybe not by name, Kuhn was writing  about how science works, the Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn tried, he was a philosopher  of science, historian of science, and he said, actually science does not move forward  the way you tend to say, scientists like to say, I'm objective and when I get a new bit  of data, I look at it, and if I follow the evidence wherever it leads and so I'm gradually  making small changes, I'm getting more evidence, I'm getting clear of you and I'm changing  my views in the court with the evidence, and Kuhn says now, that's not how it works. Kuhn says, we are very close minded, all of us, we are not open to new evidence and he says  all of us tend to have interpretive grids by which we interpret reality. Now a grid is what he called a paradigm, so yes, actually he, I think, popularized the term  paradigm, a paradigm is a way of looking at reality. And Kuhn says, we really have those views, these interpretive grids, these ways of looking  at reality, and when new evidence comes along we do everything we can to use that evidence  to confirm what we already believe. We do everything we can to work it in, now I'll tell you, one of the perfect, to me examples  of that was 9-11.

Here we all are all looking at the same horrible thing that happened, we're looking right  at it, there it is. But there were some people who had an interpretive grid that said, America is the bad guys  in the world. We're a force for materialism and abuse of power, whatever, we're the bad guys in the  world. And there was another people who said, America is the good guy, we're the force of good  on the side of good against evil. So once as America is a good guy, once as America is a bad guy, it's amazing, I read the essays  of people after 9-11, we were looking at the very same thing and everybody used it to  say, see, this is what I always said, this is what I always believed.

See 9-11, that proves that we're the bad guy, the world hates us. See 9-11, other people said, that proves that we're the good people and we have evil  on against us. We had two different groups of people with two different paradigms, they were totally  opposite to each other, they were looking at the same bit of data and using it to support  the paradigm. Thomas Koon says, we're not open-minded people, we have our set of beliefs and when a piece  of data comes, we use it to confirm what we already believe, except Koon says, sometimes  stuff comes into our lives that this rubs. Sometimes stuff comes into our lives that we can't really account for in the grid, it  doesn't really fit, it's difficult to work it in.

Koon's example, of course, the classic example was our Western understanding of the solar  system. Koon said, for years, people believed that the earth was fixed and the earth was in the  center and there were all these other bodies orbiting around it and of course that seemed  to explain. You looked up in the sky and you could see other bodies moving and we said, of course, they're  all orbiting around us and so every time you got a new bit of data, we found a new planet,  we found another, you know, the astronomers found another heavenly body, they said of course  that fits into the grid and then Koon says, what began to happen was some of the bodies  that we saw in space didn't seem to fit. Their movements didn't seem to work into this idea that everything was orbiting around  earth. Some of them kind of moved infinitely like zigzags in the sky and that didn't seem to  really work.

Koon says, what happens eventually is enough data comes in, you can't account for or something  comes in, you can't account for and it leads you to question the grid itself and you sit  there and say, oh, maybe I got it wrong and you try on, it's like trying on a dress,  you try on a new paradigm, you try something else on and you say, well, maybe the earth  is orbiting too. And when you try that paradigm on, suddenly it makes sense of all the data and you have  what he calls a paradigm shift, it's like a conversion, suddenly you realize if I change  the grid then suddenly I can explain everything else and you have this enormous shift so  he says basically because we're so close-minded, we do not move, we don't change our bodies  little by little, instead we try to work everything into confirm our existing paradigms  until something comes in a burning bush, something that doesn't fit, something you can't  account for, you try on a new way of thinking and it creates a shift, basically a kind  of conversion. Now, that's how it is with God, usually, usually something comes into your life, it's  a burning bush and you can't account for it. You've got to set a belief, either you don't believe in God or you believe whether  probably is a God but nobody knows, you either have an inconsequential God or you have  no God or something like that, a God that you don't need to know in order to live life  and then something comes into your life and you can't account for it. It could be a train of thought, we've talked about this in the last couple of weeks, you  know, WHO, who lived here in the Upper East Side in World War II, Great British Poet, didn't  believe in God, but World War II came, we talked about this at length in the last couple  of weeks.

World War II comes along, WHO sees the Nazis what they're doing and he says, wait a minute,  there's no God, what right do I have to say that my values are right and there's a wrong? If there's no God, what warrant do I have for saying I'm right and they're wrong? And so he's thought like this, if there's no God, all morality is relative but no, morality  is not relative, what they're doing is wrong and therefore there must be a God. The train of thought came along that didn't fit in to his grid and he had a paradigm shift. He had a change in it, he questioned the grid itself so it can be kind of an intellectual  burning bush, a train of thought, but very often it's something else.

Years ago when Redeemer got started and we had a few hundred people, you know, actually  in the early days, I mean the first couple of years, this body was about the size of  Redeemer, the whole of Redeemer. And we were, this is the late 80s, early 90s and we were just normal New Yorkers, we were  people who worked in Wall Street, worked in the arts, you know, worked in fashion, just  normal New Yorkers, but I used to find that if you brought a person in, the average man  had 99.9% of the average man had nights didn't believe in historic Christianity or anything  like that. But if they came in and they just sat down and they realized we all believed in historic  Christianity, they were here for about 10 or 15 minutes, they started having paradigm shifts. Redeemer itself was a burning bush, you know why? Because in their grid, people like them, people who'd gone to the same schools, people  who did the same jobs, people like them didn't believe in Christianity, see, it was just  not done, nobody did it except here's a few hundred people that were doing it.

So what are we going to do about that? And suddenly Redeemer itself sometimes was a burning bush, you could just see little  paradigm meltdowns, you know, it was coming out of their ears, you know, the paradigm,  the old paradigm, there was a shift going on, they couldn't quite account for people  that were, you know, we weren't brilliant, we're just normal, and normal people don't have  these beliefs, how could you believe that? Or sometimes a Christian comes into your life and maybe you're not a believer, and  the Christian is just so much more wise or so much more poised or so much more intelligent  and we're so much more thoughtful than you thought Christians could be and the Christian  itself is like a burning bush. We're very often, one more thing before going on, very often disillusioning and difficult  experiences, very often they're the burning bush. They come into your life and you're saying, look, I don't know if there's a God, there  might be, there might not, I don't need to know God, that's your grid, which means your  assumption is I can handle life, I can handle life, you know, I'm smart, I'm savvy,  you know, I've got, I've got a therapist, you know, I've got friends, you know, I'm  not stupid, you know, I know life isn't easy but I can handle life.

David Martin Lloyd-Jones was a physician, a young physician in Britain in the 1920s. He became a Christian, he got converted and went into the ministry after that, but he  tells about his conversion and a big part of it was this. He believed, well, a big part of it was this, a man that he admired, an older man who  was a physician and everything he wanted to be, you see, in that day and time, the best  physicians in Britain, they were heroes, they were emulated, they were, you know, they  were saving lives, they were respected, they were brilliant, they were, they were well paid,  they had enormous status and it was one of those men that Lloyd-Jones looked up to and  wanted to be like, he was dating a woman and she died, great tragedy. He came by to see Lloyd-Jones and he says, hey, it'd be okay if I stayed here for a little  bit and Lloyd-Jones says, oh, it's up to the fire and the man, Lloyd-Jones says, the man  pulled up a chair to the fire and sat down and stared at the fire for two hours, didn't  say a word. He also didn't act as if Lloyd-Jones was there.

Now, Lloyd-Jones did not have his feelings hurt and he didn't feel, in any way, that  was inappropriate. It was perfectly appropriate but when he saw one of the men, that he, a world-beater,  a person that he thought, that he wanted to be like and he realized this man was absolutely  out of resources. He had nothing left. He had nothing with which to actually face the normal realities of life. And Lloyd-Jones says, he looked at him staring at the fire and this is what he said.

He says, I suddenly saw the vanity of all human greatness. I suddenly saw the vanity of all human greatness. What was going on there? In that young man's mind, it was a burning bush. It was something that didn't fit.

He says, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, if a guy like this can't handle  life, how in the world do I think I can handle life without God? So, but here's the point. When these things come into your life and they start to challenge you and they start  to make you question the grid, are you willing to go over? Like Moses. You know, if Moses hadn't gone over, if he actually said, I don't want to be bothered,  he would have never heard of Moses.

See, once you get bothered, you have to be willing to think it out. You have to have the guts to think it out and be willing to think it out. We always say the gospel changes everything and we believe it really does. That's why here at Gospel and Life, August is Go and Share Month. Throughout August, we're inviting thousands of our listeners to take a small step in  sharing the gospel with someone God has placed in your life.

For those of you who make a gift to Gospel and Life this month, we'll send you two copies  of making sense of God by Tim Keller. It's a powerful resource that explores how Christianity makes emotional, cultural, and  rational sense in today's world. It's our thanks for your gift and provides a way you can do a small act to share the gospel  by reading the book with a friend, giving one to a coworker or passing on both copies  to people who are exploring the Christian faith. It's a simple way to start a gospel conversation or continue it. To request your two copies of making sense of God, simply go to gospelandlife.com-slash-give.

Again, that's gospelandlife.com-slash-give. Now, here's Dr. Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. Barbara Brown Taylor, in her famous sermon on the burning bush, says, imagine if Moses  had just hunched down over his shoulders and kept his head down and just stayed busy. What if Moses had said, burning bush?

I didn't really see it. I don't know what that is. Burning bush? Well, probably there's some rational explanation anyway. Burning bush.

I've been paid to watch sheep, not turn aside and look at bushes. Burning bush, would somebody please put that out? If he had done that, you never would have heard of him. He would never met God. God would never have spoken to him and the same thing would happen to you.

He got to turn aside, okay? So I disrupting sight. Second and third, they kind of go together. Second and third, if you're really going to meet God, secondly, you have to have an expanding  concept of God. Now, what do I mean by expanding concept?

Well, let's look at this idea of God revealing himself as fire. Why does God reveal himself as fire? One of the reasons is he's getting across one of the most mind-numbing, amazing things  that the Bible says about God. See, the reason Moses went to see the bush was bushes are usually dependent on the,  I mean, pardon me, fire is usually dependent on the bush. It's dependent on the bush for fuel.

And therefore, fires don't stay going forever because they have to have fuel. And after they consume the fuel, they're gone. Why? They're dependent on the fuel. But this fire wasn't dependent on the bush.

It wasn't dependent on anything. It had its own power of being within it, which of course was a miracle. But what is that symbolized? And symbolizes what God says about himself at the very end. When Moses says, well, who should I say has sent me to Israel?

What's your name in other words? And you know what God says? I'll tell you what my name is. He says, I am who I am. Tell them, I am has sent you.

Now it's actually really hard to translate this. What God really gives Moses, actually, as his name, is just the Hebrew verb to be. It's like he's almost saying, tell them being itself sent you. I am what I am, I am who I am, but basically being itself. And here's what he's saying.

I depend on nothing. Everything depends on me. I am self-sufficient. I have the power of all being in myself. I am the ground of all being.

You know, when the Bible says God has no ending, we can kind of imagine that, I guess. But when the Bible says God has no beginning, that's where my brain starts to melt. But it has to be, why? Because if something has a beginning, it's because something begins it. And if God had a beginning and something would have begun God, and whatever that something  was, God would have been dependent on, but God is saying, I am dependent on nothing.

All existence has its existence only in me. I'm at the heart of every molecule. I'm holding everything together. Hebrew is one one talks about that. In him, all things consist.

And so what God is trying to say here is that I am existence itself. I am being itself. I'm the ground of all being. I'm not just a being, I am being. I'm not just a being, I am being.

I am that I am. Jesus put it slightly more personal terms without him you can do nothing. Now here's what I'm trying to say at this point. We could talk a lot about this, and this is the name that God reveals here. But what I'm trying to show you is this, Moses is having an expanding understanding of  God.

He had a view of God, but what is this? In general, when people talk to me about not being able to believe in God. In general, I can ask them, well tell me what you don't believe in, and tell me why  it's hard to believe in God. And they always describe why I can't believe in a God who does this, I can't, and it's  I'd say four times out of five, after they tell me what they don't like about God and  why they can't believe in God. Four times out of five, I can say, oh, this is great.

I don't believe in that God either. The God you're talking about is not the God I believe in, they say what? That's always the God that people disbelieve in is a flat God, a reductionist to God, a reduced  God. Nothing like the multi-dimensional rich, rich God of the Bible. The Bible's talking about God is this, but he's also this, he's this, but he's also this,  and paradoxically he's this, and he's also this, and the simpler your understanding of God  is, the more rejectable it is.

And I'll go so far as to say, the richer and more nuanced your understanding of God,  the harder it is to reject him and the easier it is to believe in him. Certainly, the harder it is to just reject him out of hand. And what Moses was getting is an expanding understanding of God, and you will, if you're  expanding and you're understanding of God, and getting a richer understanding of God,  you're moving in the right direction. So he had a disrupting side, he had an expanding concept. Thirdly, there was a personal problem.

Now what do I mean by personal problem? Let's go back to the fire. There are a number of things that God was getting across with fire, and here's one of them. Fire is so beautiful and so scary at once. It is so brilliant and so attractive and so dangerous and so frightening at once.

Look. Moses said, here I am, verse 5, do not come any closer, God said, take off your sandals  for the place where you were standing is holy ground. At this Moses hit his face because he was afraid to look at God. Now Alec Matier, great Old Testament Bible scholar, says about this verse, that the holiness  of God is that part of God's nature that is dangerous for sinners like you and me. The holiness of God is that part of God's nature that is dangerous to sinners like  you and me.

And only we hear that, we New Yorkers say, I want a loving God, what do you mean? Dangerous? Dangerous? He's like fire. He's beautiful, but he's dangerous.

I don't think I like that, but actually, please think with me a little bit. Why is God dangerous? Why is the holiness of God his terrifying danger? Well, first two reasons. The holiness of God, first of all, means he exposes us through his perfection.

Come on, you know what this word, how this works. Whenever you're in the presence of absolute, incredible talent or beauty or brilliance,  when you're in the presence of a human being with excellence, it's just like fire. Why? It's wonderful and it's horrible. Look, you may think of yourself as not too bad looking person, then there's some people  you don't want to stand near them because you don't want people looking from you to him  or to her.

You don't want that. You know, you feel like I'm not so bad looking and then you get near somebody who makes  you ten times better looking and then you feel homely ugly. You may think of yourself as talented, you know, this is one of the true story, of course,  is that it happens very often. You may be the best violinist in hot coffee, Texas, little town, you know, and you get  off the train in New York City and there's somebody begging, you know, and grand social  station, you know, with a violin case open and people throw money in, they're playing  and they're way better than you. And you go, oh no, what's happening?

It's beautiful. I mean, violinist is beautiful. You say, well, that's beautiful, the technique, but you're scared to death. Whenever you get into the presence of something way better than you, it's horrible and wonderful. Well, how would that be true of God?

Of course it is. And this is one of the ways you know you're drawing near to the real God. When Isaiah went in to see the Holy One, high and lifted up, holy, holy, holy, he heard  the angel saying, he went into the temple and he saw the holiness of God and you've got  a figure. Isaiah, he's a prophet. Isaiah, compared to the most of the population, he would have to be more virtuous, more spiritual,  more moral, a better person than most, but what does he say about himself?

Unclean, he calls himself. Everything that Isaiah was proud of looked like trash. Because in the presence of power, you feel your weakness in the presence of beauty, you feel  your ugliness in the presence of light, you feel your darkness. And therefore God's dangerous because he is so holy and so perfect and so beautiful  that he's horrible. Because when you get near him, you have a self-quake, your self-image falls apart.

All the things you tell yourself, I'm not that bad a person, it's not true. It's just not true and you realize it's not true. All your self-justifications, all your little self-deceptions, the blindness we all have. Everybody knows that. We always sort of, that person is awful, that person is awful, but me, you have to understand.

You're always making excuses for yourself, but in the presence of God, it's incredibly traumatic. It's like a logically absolutely devastating. It's incredibly dangerous because God is so beautiful, He is dangerous. He shows you who you are. So His perfection exposes you, but also He is a God of active goodness.

The difference between active and passive goodness, there's been a lot of studies  that during the Holocaust in Germany, most Germans felt bad about the fact that the Jews  were disappearing. They justified it. They told themselves, well, they're just going to detention camps, I mean, they always,  they lied to themselves so they didn't want to admit, but basically, most Germans saw  the Jews just disappearing. They saw the Jewish neighbors just disappearing and they felt bad about it. Why?

People, but they're passively good. They didn't say anything. They didn't make waves. They were afraid to. As we all know, passive goodness isn't as good as active goodness and God is actively  good.

God is not just good in general. He doesn't tolerate evil, He doesn't tolerate evil in sin in you. And as a result, there's a danger. Now here's the third point, very important. If you're going to have an experience of God and counter God, it really ought to be a real God.

We are so affected by consumer capitalism and in consumer capitalism, we choose everything. We get what we want. Everything's customized to us. And so you don't you see what we tend to do? I do it.

Can't you do it? You get the God you want. You say, I don't like to believe in God like this. I like to believe in God like this. I hear people say this.

I like to think of God like this. I like to think of God like this. If you're creating your own God, it's just an extension of you. How's that guy going to be of any help to you? How's that guy going to give you any power?

It's just you. How's that guy going to be any resource? It's just you. If you're actually just creating God you like. So how are you going to be sure that you're drawing near to a real God, a real spiritual reality,  a true God, a living God?

How are you going to know that? And Jonathan Edwards, the great 18th century theologian philosopher says that most of the  attributes of God are attributes that we would choose if we were creating a God. You know, it'd be nice to have a powerful God because then if he's your God, then he  can help you. It'd be nice to have a merciful God, then if you're guilty he can forgive you. Almost all the attributes are attributes that we would choose, but there's one attribute  we would never choose, Edwards says, it's the holiness of God because it's just a problem.

The holiness is nothing but a problem, a big problem for us and if you are starting to  sense that this God that you're trying to come to grips with is holy and that you're  not just a good person who needs a spiritual boost from him and you're not just even a  needy person who needs fulfillment but that you're a sinner and you need forgiveness  and pardon. And you begin to actually sense that there's a problem and you've got a problem coming  into his presence. Now you have some confidence that you're not making this God up. Now you've got some confidence that you're on your way toward the real God because you  sense that you've got a personal problem, he's not just an abstraction, he's just trying  to believe in him but you've got a problem in relating to him and that brings us naturally  then the last thing you need would be you need some kind of grace, you need something  that will enable you to stand in God's presence. Moses is wondering about that.

Down here in verse 11 and 12, Moses says, but who am I that you would send me to Pharaoh  and then God says, I will be with you but if you go on in the text, you'll see Moses  is not modified here. Moses says, wait a minute, you're holy. He's starting to see who he is, what he's like and he begins to say, how in the world  am I? Well put it like this, the bush is not consumed but why isn't Moses? In Exodus 33, Moses actually asked God, can I see you face to face and God says no, you  can't, it will kill you.

Well then why is it not consumed right here? The bush isn't consumed, okay, it was a miracle but why isn't Moses consumed and the secret  and the answer, it's in the text but you probably went right by it, I do. Look all through here, it says God spoke to Moses out of the bush. God spoke to Moses out of the bush, God spoke to Moses out of the bush but who's actually  in the bush? It tells you in verse 2, the angel of the Lord.

Wait a minute you say that's weird, it says the angel was in the bush but then all the  way through the rest of the text it talks as if God's in the bush, yes, that's the way  it works in the Old Testament. There's this figure, this enigmatic figure named the angel of the Lord, not an angel of  the Lord, like Gabriel or somebody like that, the angel of the Lord and when the angel of  the Lord shows up, it's weird because on the one hand this angel of the Lord seems to be  a distinct person from God, on the other hand the angel of the Lord seems to be God. Like it'll say the angel of the Lord spoke to Abraham or the angel of the Lord spoke  to Moses but then the very next verse it'll say and God said to Moses and God said  Abraham, it's almost as if this person is both God and not God. But here's what's all so interesting, Alec Matier says, if you look carefully, the angel  of the Lord shows up when God wants to draw near to someone without destroying them. One of the most interesting spots is later on in the book of Exodus, Matier says there's  this argument going back and forth between Moses and God and Moses says, Lord, you must  your presence must go with us as the children of Israel leave Egypt and go toward the promised  line.

Your presence must go with us and God says no. My presence cannot go with you because you are rebellious people and my presence will  destroy you. And then Moses pushes back and says no, no, I'm not going to go unless you go with us and  then finally God says, Matier points this out in his commentary on Exodus. He finally says, wait, okay, I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'll send my angel with you.

And here's what Matier says about that. Moses says, I want your presence. God says no, it'll destroy you. Most I want your presence. Okay, I'll send you my angel.

And here's what Matier says in his commentary. He says the angel of the Lord is revealed as the merciful accommodation of God whereby  the Lord can be present among a sinful people when were he to go with them himself. God's presence would consume them. So the angel is that mode of deity whereby the holy God can keep company with sinners  without destroying them. And then Matier goes on and says, who would that be?

He says there is only one other in the Bible who is both identical with and yet distinct  from the Lord. One who while affirming the wrath of God is yet a supreme display of his mercy. The angel of the Lord can only be understood as a pre-incarnate appearance of Jesus Christ. And do you remember in John chapter 8, Jesus says to his listeners, before Abraham was  I am. He doesn't say before Abraham was I was.

That would have been weird enough. But he says before Abraham was I am. And what is he saying? He's saying, I'm the one who spoke to Moses from the bush. And now here's the secret.

Here's the answer to all the riddles. You say, well, how is Jesus Christ the angel of the Lord? How is Jesus Christ the way that we can be in the presence of God without being consumed? Oh my goodness, here it is. Here's how you can finally see the fire of God.

Fire is terrible and beautiful. And on the cross you see how terribly holy God is. He is so terribly holy that Jesus Christ had to die. God is actively good. God has to meet out punishment on sin.

Just can't be shrugged at. He is so terribly holy, Jesus had to die, but he is so beautifully loving, so beautifully  loving that in Jesus Christ he was willing to come and glad to die, willing to die, make  his own atonement. And there it is. We have hymns about this. One hymn goes, before the throne absolved we stand, thy love has met, thy laws demand.

Terrible, horrible, beautiful, gorgeous, and if you want to know the ravishing beauty of  this fiery God, a God who wants so holy that you got a problem with him and yet so loving  that he solved the problem at his own expense. If you say, I want to know that God, you will come to know that God, why? Because that's the God who reveals himself to Moses in the bush and that's the God who  reveals himself to people. And guess what will happen if you do that? If you believe in Jesus Christ, you will become a burning bush.

Moses did. Moses went out and changed the world. Why? Because the glory and the beauty of God came into his life. In fact, at one point he had to put a veil over his face and it didn't consume him.

Why? Well, he wasn't really sure. He just knew that somehow atonement had been made, but you and I know. Peter 1, verse 3 says, the Christians have been made partakers of the divine nature. Ephesians 2 says, we're temples of the Holy Spirit, the light and the uncommon light and  the beauty and the glory of God can come into your life and yet you not be consumed because  of the merits and mediation of Jesus Christ and then you become a little burning bush.

And you become someone who can, who people go over to see, to figure out because you're  inexplicable. When you become someone who can touch others or have God touch others through you and  you can change the world, do you believe in the God who revealed Himself to Moses and  the burning bush with us pray? Father, we thank you for giving us this pathway to experience of you and we ask that you  would help us now even as we participate in the Lord's Supper to know you. That is an abstract God but is a fiery loving God. We pray that you would help every Christian here experience your reality and everyone  here who is not yet know you also come to experience that reality we ask it in Jesus'  name.

### 中文翻译

### 引言：公开的信仰

当谈到公开你的信仰时，你有多自在？在本月的播客中，Tim Keller 探讨了圣经对公开信仰的看法。他向我们展示了在多元化社会中如何以一种创造文明、和平和有意义的对话的方式公开我们的信仰。

今晚的经文来自出埃及记第三章，第一至十四节。

> “摩西牧养他岳父米甸祭司叶忒罗的羊群，领羊群到旷野的尽头，来到神的山，就是何烈山。耶和华的使者从荆棘中火焰里向摩西显现。摩西看见荆棘被火烧着，却没有烧毁。摩西说，我要过去看这大异象，这荆棘为何没有烧毁。”

**当耶和华见他过去要看，神从荆棘中呼叫他说，摩西，摩西。他说，我在这里。神说，不要近前来，当把你脚上的鞋脱下来，因为你所站之地是圣地。**

### 摩西与燃烧的荆棘

然后他说，我是你父亲的神，是亚伯拉罕的神，以撒的神，雅各的神。摩西蒙上脸，因为怕看神。耶和华说，我实在看见了我百姓在埃及所受的困苦，我也听见他们因受督工的辖制所发的哀声，我原知道他们的痛苦。我下来是要救他们脱离埃及人的手，领他们出了那地，到美好宽阔流奶与蜜之地，就是迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人之地。

> “现在以色列人的哀声达到我耳中，我也看见埃及人怎样欺压他们。所以现在我要打发你去见法老，使你可以将我的百姓以色列人从埃及领出来。”

摩西对神说，我是谁，竟能去见法老，将以色列人从埃及领出来呢？神说，我必与你同在。这就是我打发你去的证据，你将百姓从埃及领出来之后，你们必在这山上事奉我。

### 遇见上帝的四个要素

摩西对神说，我到以色列人那里，对他们说，你们祖宗的神打发我到你们这里来，他们若问我说，他叫什么名字，我要对他们说什么呢？神对摩西说，我是自有永有的。又说，你要对以色列人这样说，那自有的打发我到你们这里来。耶和华的话，感谢上帝。

现在，每周我们都在探讨如何在公共场合谈论我们最深的信仰信念，如何分享我们是谁，我们的深信信念，但以一种尊重的方式，促进和平，我多年来观察到，公开讨论信仰的最佳方式之一不是简单地谈论你相信什么，而是你是如何相信的。

### 扰乱的景象

摩西真正遇见上帝的第一件事就是荆棘本身，第二和第三节。摩西看见荆棘被火烧着，却没有烧毁，所以摩西说，我要过去看这大异象，这荆棘为何没有烧毁。

**现在，摩西可能最初看到的是远处的火，但这并不罕见，在沙漠中有很多原因可以引起火灾，但吸引他注意的是这火没有熄灭。**

### 扩展的概念

为什么神以火显现？其中一个原因是他在传达圣经关于神的最令人震惊、惊人的事情之一。看，摩西去看荆棘是因为荆棘通常依赖于，抱歉，火通常依赖于荆棘。它依赖于荆棘作为燃料。

**因此，火不会永远燃烧，因为它们需要燃料。燃料被消耗后，它们就消失了。为什么？因为它们依赖于燃料。但这火不依赖于荆棘。它不依赖于任何东西。它有自己的存在力量，这当然是一个奇迹。**

### 个人问题

神通过火传达了许多事情，这就是其中之一。火既美丽又可怕。它既辉煌又吸引人，同时又危险又令人恐惧。

> “摩西说，我在这里，第五节，神说，不要近前来，当把你脚上的鞋脱下来，因为你所站之地是圣地。摩西蒙上脸，因为怕看神。”

### 惊人的恩典

摩西对此感到疑惑。在第十一和十二节，摩西说，我是谁，你竟打发我去见法老，然后神说，我必与你同在，但如果你继续看经文，你会看到摩西并没有因此而改变。摩西说，等等，你是圣洁的。他开始看到自己是谁，他是什么样的人，他开始说，我怎么可能呢？

**这样说吧，荆棘没有被烧毁，但为什么摩西没有被烧毁呢？在出埃及记33章，摩西实际上问神，我可以面对面见你吗？神说不，你不能，这会杀了你。那么为什么这里没有被烧毁呢？荆棘没有被烧毁，好吧，这是一个奇迹，但为什么摩西没有被烧毁，答案就在经文中，但你可能忽略了，我也是。**

通篇都说神从荆棘中对摩西说话。神从荆棘中对摩西说话，神从荆棘中对摩西说话，但实际上谁在荆棘中？第二节告诉你，是耶和华的使者。

> “等等，你说这很奇怪，它说使者在荆棘中，但在其余的经文中却好像是神在荆棘中，是的，这就是旧约中的运作方式。”

### 结论

父啊，我们感谢你给我们这条通往你体验的道路，我们请求你帮助我们现在，即使我们参与圣餐，也能认识你。不是一个抽象的神，而是一个火热的爱神。我们祈求你帮助这里的每一个基督徒体验你的真实，每一个尚未认识你的人也能体验到这种真实，我们奉耶稣的名祈求。阿门。
