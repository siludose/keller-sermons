## English Transcript / 英文原文

the Scriptures,  that He was buried,  that He was raised on the third day  according to the Scriptures,  and that He appeared to seephus,  and then to the 12. After that, He appeared to more than 500  of the brothers and sisters at the same time,  most of whom are still living,  though some have fallen asleep. Then He appeared to James,  then to all the apostles,  and last of all, He appeared to me also  as to one abnormally born. For I am the least of the apostles  and do not even deserve to be called an apostle,  because I persecuted the Church of God. But by the grace of God,  I am what I am,  and His grace to me was not without effect.

No, I worked harder than all of them,  yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me. Whether then it is I or they,  this is what we preach,  and this is what you believed. Here ends the reading. So we're looking at,  for a number of weeks,  we're looking at the subject of public faith. What does it mean to talk about  your deepest beliefs,  who you are,  with others in public,  who may not share your beliefs,  and how do you do that in a way  that's transparent, that's honest.

The same time is respectful. It promotes peace. This is something that everyone in the plural  is excited and needs to learn how to do. And we've been looking at this each week. And today you come to maybe perhaps  one of the more obvious things that you have to talk about.

We need to talk about  if we're going to discuss this subject. And that is what actually  are the core beliefs of Christianity. You can't talk in public about Christianity,  unless at some point you get down to say,  well, what is it? What are the core things that Christians believe? What do you believe in order to be a Christian?

And if you're going to do that,  there's no better spot in the whole Bible than here. Sure, there's other places in the Bible,  but this has a special place  because look,  at the passage it was just read to you. Paul says,  now brothers and sisters,  I want to remind you of the gospel. I preach to you that you received  by this you were saved,  and I had received it,  and I passed it on to you,  and it's a first importance of the very end,  he says,  so whether it's higher they,  meaning the others that are apostles,  this is what we preach,  and this is what you believed. What he is giving you is not only a gospel presentation.

He says,  here's the gospel I preached to you. I received it. You believed it. It saved you. But he's also speaking in the book of 1 Corinthians,  and there's an amazing amount of consensus  that 1 Corinthians was written just 20 years after  the death of Jesus Christ,  that it was perhaps the oldest  of all the peeps of literature we have in the New Testament.

And if that's the case,  then when Paul talks about this is what I did before,  he says,  remember when I came before,  I'm giving you a summary of the gospel  that I received,  that I gave you,  that you believed,  that saved you,  he's talking about something that happened just a handful of years  after Jesus' death. So if you want to get down to the foundations,  what is Christianity all about? What is Christianity believed? What is the irreducible core  that you must believe to be a Christian  and to have spiritual life? Here it is, right here.

And the reason why it's so important to keep in mind  if you're doing public talking about this in public  is if you're a Christian,  it is so important to major in the majors. There's lots and lots of things that Christians believe  and there's lots of things that different branches of Christian  Christianity believe,  and some of them may be very true,  very dear to your heart,  but you really should not press and push and talk  about beliefs that a lot of other Christians don't even share. You ought to major in the majors and hear the majors. And if you're skeptical of Christianity,  it's also crucial to get straight what Christianity really is. Over the years when people talk to me about how they're skeptical,  they really don't believe,  and I ask them,  well, what do you think Christianity teaches?

They tell me,  and as gently as possible,  I have to point out that that's not what Christianity teaches. I usually say something like,  I don't know a single church in the whole world that believes that. And of course,  I try to say it a nice tone,  but since I use this illustration in the beginning  and I realize,  that's not very gentle is it? No, maybe I shouldn't put it that way,  but the deal is,  do you really understand the Christianity you think you're rejecting? David Martin Lloyd-Jones,  great British preacher,  had a question that he used to ask people,  that he considered a diagnostic question.

It's a simple question,  and he would say,  do you consider yourself a Christian? And the person would say,  yes or no, he said,  well, why? And if a person says,  why do you think I'm a Christian? I think I'm trying hard to live according to the teachings of the Bible. I'm trying very hard to live like Christ.

I'm trying very hard to surrender and be like him. And Dr. Lloyd-Jones says,  if somebody gives an answer like that,  he knows that even though that's very, very typical,  very typical,  that that person doesn't really understand the gospel,  doesn't understand the core teachings. This is the gospel. What is it?

Well, let's just move right through it. There's actually four parts to this. The gospel is about Jesus. It's about sin and substitution. It's about history and resurrection.

And it's about astonishing, transforming grace. Just right through it. Okay, so first of all,  it's about Jesus,  because see, for what I received,  I passed on to you as a first importance,  and as soon as he begins,  his summary of the gospel, he says,  that Christ,  and actually, everything else,  in the whole paragraph,  is just a set of clauses or phrases that explain Christ. They all point back to Christ. The gospel is Christ, actually.

The gospel is Jesus Christ. Now, how would that be? Well, the word gospel,  though many people understand the word gospel means joyful news. That's what the Greek word technically means. It was actually used to announce a history-changing event.

It was the word that meant,  it was usually used to announce something like  the carnation of a new king,  the defeat of an invading army,  something like that,  some major news event. And if that's the core,  if the core of Christian teaching is a gospel,  then right away we're confronted with  what makes Christianity different from all of the religions. See, all of the religions contain  narratives about their founders, of course. All of the religions tell stories and have narratives  about the lives of their founders. But their founders, all the other religions,  their founders are teachers not saviors.

And because their teachers not saviors,  their life story is not the core of the core of those religions. The core of the core of those religions,  like the five pillars of Islam  or the eightfold path to enlightenment of Buddhism,  the core of the core of those religions  is always a set of directions about what you must do. Since the founders are teachers,  the core of the core of those religions  is a set of directions about what you must do. But the core of the core of Christianity is a gospel. That's not a set of directions about what you must do.

It's an account of what has been done. It's not actually advice. Christianity is not advice about what you must do. It's news. It's news about what he has done.

And in fact, one of the most striking things about this whole passage  is from verse three all the way to the end,  this description of the gospel,  there's nothing in here about what you must do. In fact, the gospel in here doesn't even contain  that you must repent and believe. Now, of course, you must repent and believe the gospel. If it's to be operative in your life,  and he says so up in verse two,  he says which you received,  and you took your stand on it. But see, technically,  that's a response to the gospel.

It's not actually part of the gospel. Why? Because the gospel is that nothing you can do,  nothing you will do,  nothing you have ever done can be the basis  for your acceptance with God. It all happens to what Jesus Christ has done. There's nothing you have done,  nothing you can do, nothing you will do,  nothing you do can be the basis for your acceptance with God.

It all comes to what Jesus Christ has done. So even repenting and believing is an actually part  of the gospel, technically,  it's a response to the gospel. And of course, the gospel brings massive changes to your life. It makes you an agent of reconciliation,  injustice, and love in the world. It profoundly changes your character.

It changes the very structure of your identity. It changes the very pathways of your heart. It changes the way your heart works. And yet, those are results of the gospel. You never find the authors of the scripture.

You never find the apostles or Paul ever loading that  into the gospel as if that's part of it. No. In a sense, the gospel is Jesus Christ. It is Jesus. So first of all, it's about Christ.

Secondly, though, it's about sin and substitution. Okay, so what's the first thing Jesus... Oh, we're told about Jesus. It says that Christ died for our sins. Die for our sins.

The very first thing, sin and substitution. First of all, sin. The first thing that we're told about what Jesus came to do  is deal with sin. We are uninformed and we need wisdom. Yes.

We are sufferers and we need help. We need support. We need relief. Yes. But, what we're learning here is,  first of all, we're sinners needing salvation.

That is to say, sin is our most fundamental human problem. And I got that takes a little bit of explanation. He said, why is that? Well, first of all, sin means that if God created you,  and if there is a God who created you  and who sustains you every single second,  and keeps you actually together from... You may say it's gravity.

Well, okay, where's that from? Or it's the way... It's the way, you know, the electrons stay in orbit  around the nucleus. What's keeping that together? You are being held together every second by God.

If there is a God who created you and sustains you  and who does all that,  then you owe him everything. Or, you owe it not to him just to pray  when you're in trouble or something like that. You owe it to live for him, to live for him totally. But sin is the teaching of the Bible. That, of course, you know this.

We don't live for him. We don't live for God. We don't live for our neighbor. We live for ourselves. We tend to live selfishly.

We've ruined the world. That's sin. But, well, see, to say he died for sin  means that that's our fundamental problem. Everything else comes from that because we're alienated from our maker. And we need...

The word alienation doesn't... You know, it's not used very much. But I want you to see how important it is. And I think I can do that by just giving you a simple illustration. Sin means we're personally and legally alienated from our maker.

There's a barrier there. And Jesus came to do something about it. And before he can do anything else,  he has to do that. So imagine you have a friend. You've been friends for a good long time.

Something changes. First, you notice your friend uses things that you give your friend  without acknowledgement, without gratitude. Then it gets worse. You find your friend lying to you, breaking promises,  and then lying to you. And finally, it gets terrible.

Your friend embezzles money from you because you're maybe in business together. We're just steals from you and robs from you. And after all this comes out, your friend sits down and says,  oh, can we stay friends because I really... I'll try to do better. I'll try to live better.

And I'm very sorry. And what are you going to say? Now, you'll use your own words. And you'll use your own words. But essentially, you're going to say,  hmm, we are in a state of alienation.

It's both legal and personal. Because what you're going to say is,  look, I know you're sorry. I guess you're sorry. And of course, if we're ever going to be friends again,  if this state of alienation is going to go away,  you will have to be sorry. But it won't be enough just to do better.

What are we going to do about what you did to me? You've robbed. There's a debt. There's a crime. Bad things have happened.

There's an injustice that has to be dealt with  if we are ever going to be friends again. See? Personal and legal. And of course, with God,  it would be writ infinitely larger  because you have an infinite God. Then you have an infinite debt.

You have an infinite crime. And there's a barrier. And that's the reason why Jesus could not come as a teacher. Because teachers come and say,  here's how you can be sorry and do a little better. That doesn't deal with the problem.

Doesn't deal with the alienation. Does it? Doesn't deal with the barrier. And Jesus came to deal with the barrier. How?

Substitution. This little word four is not very revealing to us  because our English word four, F-O-R,  covers such an enormous range of meanings. You have to have to sit and think and reflect before you know  in what way something is for something else. There's all sorts of categories. Fortunately, Greek had more prepositions that serviced.

And the preposition used here is who pair which means  on behalf of in the place of. As a substitute. This is saying that Jesus Christ died on behalf of us. He was a substitute. He died instead of us.

He took what we deserve. In other words, Jesus Christ took our place. The place we deserve to be cast out on the cross. And if we believe in Him,  then we get the place that He deserved at the table in the family. Love, child of God.

Second Corinthians 5, 21, God made Him sin, who knew no sin,  that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. Now, there's a lot of different metaphors  that the Bible uses to try to describe what happened on the cross. There's the language of the marketplace. Sometimes it talks about that Jesus Christ on the cross paid a price. Why?

Because sin is a debt. We just talked about that. And in the olden days, if you had a debt, you couldn't pay. You went into slavery until you could pay it. And Jesus Christ, we're told in the Bible, is our ransom.

He redeems us out of slavery. He pays the price. And so we're liberated. So you have the language of the marketplace and sin is a debt. Another kind of language is used to deal with the cross.

It's the language of the battlefield. You know why? Because sin is not just a debt. It's not just a legal debt. It's a powerful evil force.

It's in you and me. It makes us do things we hate. That's the reason why Paul, you know, in Romans 7 says,  very often I find I'm doing the very thing I hate. It absorbs us with ourselves and fills us with fears  and fills us with all sorts of things. And we do things we don't like to do.

It's a force inside. Of course, it's a force outside. People can wrong us. And Jesus Christ comes. And the Bible, some places talks about Jesus going to the cross  to defeat the powers of evil and sin and death.

And it's a terrible struggle. And he suffers horribly. But in the end, he fights and he wins for us. So there's the language of the marketplace, the language of the battlefield. There's also the language of the law court.

The language of the law court says that sin is also a violation of a standard. And if there is a God, you want him to be against evil and injustice, don't you? You don't want God to be passive. You don't want your God just to look on. You want him to do something about it.

You want him to be judicially wrathful against evil and injustice. But then to see if we have any evil in sin in us,  then that wrath, that judicial wrath, that condemnation lies on us,  but Jesus Christ comes and takes the punishment that we deserve. Now, as different as that is, there's others, there's others. But all those metaphors are wonderful because they show different aspects of the human problem  and they show different wonderful aspects of the rich salvation we have. But do you notice there's a thread running through all of them?

Every single one of them. Substitution. Jesus fights. Jesus pays. Jesus bears what we couldn't bear.

And that's the reason why John's thought in one of the best passages in all of his writings. He was an Anglican minister, British Anglican minister. He says that the concept of substitution is crucial to understand both sin and salvation. If you want to understand the gospel, you've got to understand substitution. Because on the one hand, what is sin?

It's you substituting yourself for God, putting yourself for only God deserves to be. In charge of your own life, you didn't make yourself. But see, when you say, I'm going to call the shots of my own life, what are you saying? I'm my own maker. I'm my own creator.

When you act as if you're your own maker and your creator and your own creator,  and you're not, it's kind of cosmic plagiarism, you know? And when you put yourself in that place and you're woefully under, by the way,  you're woefully under qualified for the job of being Lord of your life. Woefully under. See, sin is you substituting yourself for God. Well, salvation is God substituting himself for you, putting himself where you deserve to be.

God going to the cross and taking his own punishment. Now, sin is substitution. Very first thing out of Paul's mouth, when he's summarizing the thing that changed people's lives  at the beginning of the beginning of the Christian movement, at the core of the core of all Christian beliefs. And yeah, even though I love to run on and I want to go on,  I need to stop for a little bit because this, as important as this is,  as core as this is to Christianity, it flies right in the face of our culture. The idea that all people are sinners, that Jesus Christ had to go to the cross,  take our punishment, a swage, propitiate is the old word, the wrath of God,  satisfy the wrath of God, that just wrinkles at a hundred levels in our culture.

But I would like to just briefly, therefore, deal with a couple of issues, kind of loose ends. One is I would like to respond to the objection that this is a primitive bloodthirsty idea,  this idea of Jesus Christ going to the cross, substituting himself. And I'd also like to show you that this is the most democratic egalitarian, possible doctrine. So first of all, one of the charges is this whole idea that Jesus Christ goes  and He has to shed His blood in order to satisfy the punishment and wrath of God. Many people say, that's just incredible.

It's just like the ancient primitive pagan terrible religions. They're all bloody with all that sacrifice stuff. J.I. Packer in his great book, Knowing God, has a chapter in which he deals with this subject. And he brings out a perfect example of what people mean when they think about primitive pagan bloodthirsty religion.

He talks about the Iliad, Homer's Iliad. And in the Iliad, some of you know, probably from sixth grade, you know. The Greek army has taken ship to go to Troy. Remember because Prince Paris has taken Helen away. And the general of the Greek army, which was Agamemnon,  finds that they can't say, oh, why?

Because of contrary wins. Because the gods for some reason are angry at them. So Agamemnon sends for his daughter and ceremonially slaughters her as a sacrifice,  malifies the hostile gods. The old word was propitiation. He propities the wrath of the gods and then they can sail to Troy.

That was the, by the way, if you learn this in sixth grade, they probably left that part out. They left it out for me when I actually started reading. I said, why didn't they tell me the best stuff, you know. Well, people say, there we go. Oh, my word.

Here's a father who sacrifices his daughter, his child,  to malify the gods, to propitiate their wrath. This is terrible. And Christianity is just like that. It's primitive and bloodthirsty just like that. And J.R.

Packer says, no, no. Not only is it not like that, it's utterly different. Why? And here's what he says. He says, in paganism, man propituates his gods.

And religion becomes a form of commercialism and indeed of bribery. In Christianity, however, God propities his own wrath  through his own sacrificial action of love. See, as God comes in Jesus Christ and goes  and he takes his own punishment, it's utterly different. It's the reverse of ancient primitive bloodthirsty religion. Don't say that.

Now, secondly, I'd like to say something on the contrary about this doctrine of substitutionism. It's radically egalitarian and democratic. And if you think, you say, boy, that's kind of weird. I want you to look at the little word in here right in the beginning of the gospel presentation,  where Paul says Christ died for our sins. You know what's so interesting about that?

There's a world of meaning in that. Paul did not say for your sins. Paul was a Hebrew of the Hebrews. Paul tells us about what an incredibly fastidious, godly religious person he was. He poured over the Bible and he tried to find anything the Bible says that we should do.

And he did everything he possibly could in order to comply with every single aspect of God's law. And did everything he could. And yet here he is saying what? That Jesus Christ substituted himself and died for our sins, meaning I deserve to die too. My record deserves death.

Now, if that seems absolutely inexplicable to you, you need to read the book of Romans chapters one, two, and three,  where he, in a very top level summary of that. He spends one chapter talking about the pagans. Yes, the Gentiles, the people who didn't believe the Bible,  and they don't follow the biblical rules of chastity and purity and integrity and so on. But then he turns to people who believe the Bible. And he shows that though externally, they're obeying the Bible inside their motivation is not for love of God, but for love of self.

Inside their self-righteousness, there's pride. And he gets to chapter three, and he says, therefore, all have sinned and falls short of the glory of God. And he says, no one is righteous, no not one. No one is really even seeking for God. It's an amazing statement.

Because here's what Paul is saying. Paul is saying, the people that all of my life I was taught to despise, the Gentiles, the people that I wouldn't even want to eat with,  because they're unclean. They don't follow the Bible. The people that I've always despised, now I'm spending my whole life with. I'm spending my whole life with them.

Why? Because we're not really any different. He says, I'm really no better than a criminal that slits people's throats and takes their money. In the end, though, of course, we're lost in different ways. In the end, though, we violate the law of God in different ways.

In the end, we all fail to love God without our hard soul strength and our neighbors ourselves in different ways. And therefore, we're all equally sinners. We're all equally lost and we're all equally in need of God's grace. That is the most radically egalitarian humanizing doctrine there is. Look at Paul.

What turned him from a self-righteous racist into a person who embraces all people as his equals ought to say what? It was the gospel. It humanized him. Because every other religion and philosophy says this is what you must do to get saved. This is what you must do to find God.

This is what you must do to save the world. This is what you must do in order to be a good person or a moral person. In which case, there's always a bunch of people over here not doing what you think should be done. And therefore, you have to say, oh, look, they're not doing this. But see, Paul says it doesn't matter.

Liberal conservative, moral immoral, you know, avant-garde, respectable. This race, that race, it doesn't matter. We're all sinners. We're all in need of grace. How radically humanizing that is.

How radically egalitarian that is. You know why? Because we're all the problem with this world. You can't look in every, I think every other philosophy I know. Every other political platform I know.

Every other religion I know basically says we know what we should be doing. And these people over here are the problem with the world. And of course, Paul says, no, no, no, no. We're all the problem. You know, Agatha Christie's novel, Murder on the Orient Express.

It's her detective, Paul Rowe. It's stuck on a train, stuck in a snow drift. And a man is murdered. And he's trying to figure out who was the murderer. And he's on the train with 12 other passengers.

So which of the 12 has done the murder? So he's trying to figure it out. And this is the hardest one he's ever seen. Because all the clues are pointing in different ways. And he realizes he's missing something.

He's missing something. What is the key insight that will make sense of everything? What is the key insight that will make sense of everything? Well, the surprise answer, and I'm going to tell you. And if anybody complains about spoilers, I want you to know that this book has been out for 80 years.

And if you haven't read it or seen it, I don't want to hear it. You know what the key insight is? Everybody done it. All 12 people murdered the man together. And suddenly everything makes sense.

They're all the villains. They're all the murders. They're all in it. Okay. This is the clue the Gospel gives you,  without which your life won't make sense.

Society won't make sense. And history won't make sense. We're all in it. We're all in it. No one is right.

Just no not one. Most democratic, egalitarian doctrine. Okay, now thirdly. The third part of this Gospel presentation is the longest,  but it doesn't mean it necessarily is more important than the others. In some ways it's probably long.

It's about the resurrection of Jesus. It's probably longer because it's setting up the fact that the rest of the chapter  is going to be a lengthy, wonderful, remarkable treatment of the doctor of the resurrection  because it was an issue in the Corinthian church. But the point is he is now saying the third part is of the Gospel is history and the resurrection. He says that Christ died for sins according to the Scriptures. He was buried.

He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures. He appeared to seephus, that's Peter, then the twelve apostles after that he appeared  in more than 500 of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living,  then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, and last of all he appeared to me  and he's saying almost as if he had to come back and make a special trip  like I was born at the wrong time. But he even appeared to me. Now what's he talking about? The resurrection.

Why does the resurrection of Jesus Christ play an important role in the Gospel? It plays an important role because it's crucial to both, it's crucial in that the resurrection of Jesus  usures and secures are past and are future salvation. First of all, it usures and secures are past salvation. How do you know that Jesus dies on the cross actually paid for sins? How do you know it actually defeated sin?

How do you know that the punishment was taken? How do you know it's all paid? So that if you believe in him, there's no more condemnation for there. How do you know? Well see, if somebody was in debt in those days, they were either in slavery or maybe they'd be in prison.

And the only way you knew that the debt had been paid. And the way you could be sure you knew that debt had been paid was when they were released, when they were sprung. Then you knew that the debt had been paid. And of course, the wages of sin is death. And when Jesus Christ was sprung from death and he burst the bands of death, that's proof that it was paid.

That's proof that it was paid. If you're shopping in a store and you have a bag with some things you've already purchased,  there's nothing more unfortunate and kind of unpleasant than to have some plain clothesmen come up and say,  have you really bought those things? Let me look inside your bag. And you're irritated and you're feeling very bad, but what do you do? What you do is you reach in and you pull out what?

The receipt and you say, trouble me not. You say, be gone. Why? This is proof that your accusation has no merit. Do you know how to do that with a resurrection if you're a Christian?

Have you learned to do that yet? When your conscience goes after you, you've failed, you've done something really, really bad and it's killing you. Are you a Christian? Have you believed in Jesus Christ? Your conscience is killing.

Do you know how to get out the resurrection and say,  to your conscience, trouble me not? Be gone. This is my receipt. This proves that it was paid in full. This proves this stamps paid in full across history in such a way that nobody is ever going to miss it.

Do you know how to do that? So on the one hand, the resurrection assures and secures you, your past salvation,  but then secondly, it assures and secures the future salvation because our future salvation is not just  being forgiven and going and living in heaven as a soul. Our future is a resurrected body and a new heavens and a new earth and a place without suffering and death. Do you know what that's going to be like? What are our Tolkien in an essay called on fairy stories?

Try us to help us understand why we so love fairy tales or science fiction or what we call fantasy tales. We read them all the time. We watch them. We turn them into blockbuster pictures year after year after year. And then there you have magic and you have fantasy.

And he's trying to understand why in the world, especially in our modern age when we're very secular,  we're very scientific, and we know these stories are fiction. Why we still pour into the movie theater, we read the books, and we find ourselves moved. And he says, here's why, because these stories show us some things. They depict things that we long for, that we can't stop longing for. And here's what some of them are.

He says, we long for the ability to step outside of time. The idea of being able to step outside of time fascinates us. Secondly, we long for escape from death. Thirdly, we long for love without parting. Love that doesn't end.

It doesn't end with love without parting. Fourthly, we long. We're fascinated by the idea of having communication with non-human beings. And then lastly, he says, we actually, of course, long for a final defeat of evil. And so whenever we see these kinds of stories, they just fasten us.

We can never get enough of them because it scratches where we itch. We have this incredible longing for these things. But do you know that if the resurrection of Jesus Christ really happened  and if you believe in Him, all those things are actually literally going to come true? They're literally going to come true. And look, if you are skeptical of Christianity, okay, you're skeptical of Christianity,  but why wouldn't you want that to be true?

If you don't want that to be true, you're not being honest with yourself. And Christianity promises it. More than promises it. Essentially, it demonstrates it. It essentially proves it with a resurrection.

And that's the reason why he does all this. Why is he going on? He was seen by Seefus. He was seen by the 12th. He was seen by 500 people who are still, most of whom are still alive.

Richard Bauchem in his great book, Jesus and the eyewitnesses, points out that these are footnotes. See, if you're writing a serious academic work today, especially historical work,  you have to have footnotes. Why? Because your footnote basically says,  here's how you can find out that what I'm saying is right. So, for example, if you say, in such and such and such and such, this happened.

Well, what you do is you footnote the historical register in this particular library  where the original letter is or something like that. He says, footnotes are ways for you to say to the reader what I'm saying is true  and the footnote is a source from which you can find out that what I'm telling you is true. But see, in those days, if you're writing not legend, but history, how did you do a footnote? You said, here are the witnesses who are alive who saw it, you can go check. These are footnotes.

These are sources. And Paul was saying, there's hundreds of people who saw Jesus with their own eyes. Go talk to them. Most of them are still alive. There's only 20 years later at this point.

Do you see what that means? Paul is saying, the resurrection was not a symbol. It's not a nice story. It's not a legend. It's come down to us through the ages.

People saw him. There is evidence. And if that's the case and the stuff that you most long for in life,  the kind of world you most long for is available. It's there. Believe the gospel.

Look, at the very, very end. This ending is technically a testimony and is wonderful. Because see, the gospel ultimately is personal. It's not just a set up bullet points. And he says, for I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle,  because I persecuted the Church of God.

But by the grace of God, I am what I am. And his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than them all. Yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me. Look at three things, as we just said.

First of all, this is the gospels about grace. Notice three times he uses the word. The gospel is about grace, grace, grace. The reason my Lloyd Jones could use that diagnostic question and say to people,  are you a Christian? And if they said, well, I'm trying, trying very hard,  the reason he knew that they didn't understand the core of Christianity was because they didn't understand grace.

They're basically saying, well, if I work hard enough, then maybe God will bless me. Oh, my word. Do you, John Bunion, who wrote Pilgrim's progress in his autobiography,  Grace Abounding to the Truth, to the chief of sinners,  tells a story of how he probably got converted. He had been reading the Bible, and it just made him feel more guilty. But he said, one day, he just thought of something.

And he says in here, he says, one day, as I was passing through a field,  suddenly I thought of a sentence, a sentence. Your righteousness is in heaven. And he explains how then, with the eyes of faith, putting together things he'd read in the Bible,  he says, with the eyes of faith, I saw Christ sitting at God's right hand, and suddenly I realized,  there's my righteousness. God could not say, where is your righteousness today, for it was always right in front of him. My good frame of heart could not make my righteousness better, nor a bad frame of heart,  make my righteousness worse.

My righteousness was Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. And now my chains fell off indeed. I felt delivered from slavery to guilt and fears, and I saw that all those weak character qualities in my heart  were like the pennies that a rich man carries in his pocket when his goal is safe in a trunk at home. Grace, get grace until the grace penny drops you haven't got the gospel. Secondly, however, grace does not mean, okay, well, you're just accepted.

That's all there is to it, doesn't change you, of course it changes you, because he says, what? His grace to me was not without effect. Boy, and that is the understatement of the year. Because what he says is, I hated Christianity, and what he doesn't say is, I'm a brilliant man. See, Paul is one of the most influential people in the history of the world.

He was brilliant, and he hated Christianity, and yet Grace changed him. Well, how can Grace change you? Well, because Grace is undeserved, once you realize that God's grace is undeserved, it humbles you. But then when you also realize that Grace is unconditional, because it's undeserved, it takes you down. I'm no different than anybody else, but because it's unconditional, it brings you back up.

I'm always accepted, I'm always loved, peace, boldness, but because it was costly, it's absolutely free to you, God's grace. But it's infinitely costly to him, because of what he had to go through on the cross. It turns you into a sacrificial lover of other people. It was not without effect, it was not without effect. And lastly, it just fills you with wonder.

You see, he's almost, I just kind of amazed at himself. He's just looking at me saying, but by the grace of God, I am what I am. When you say something, when you, you know, Kathy pointed out to me that this week in the Tuesday of Science Times of the New York Times,  it talks about the fact that we're probably on the verge of finding a cure for hep C, which is a disease, by the way,  that kills more people than AIDS. It just gives you a miserable life while it's killing you. And it looks like possibly, they went to pains to say it's not for certain, but it looks like there's not just a vaccine, but a pill, just a pill, not even a vaccine,  that you take, and it can take it out of your body in a couple of months.

And of course, everybody who's hearing about it, they're just excited, they're astounded, they're amazed, they're telling each other, they're rushing. Of course, you're going to be like that. Of course, you're going to be like, think of the joy of knowing that the death sentence that was over you is taken away. Or are you going to tell everybody about it? Aren't you going to be amazed?

Well, listen, the gospel would be way more than that. We're talking about not just extending your life a few years. We're talking about love without parting, escape from death, communication with non-human beings. We're talking about everything you've ever wanted. How could you not be filled with joy?

How could you not want to tell people that it's praying? Our Father, we thank you for the gospel. We thank you for the glad, joyful tidings of the gospel. And we ask that the undeservedness, the unconditional nature of it, the costliness of it,  would change us the way it changed Paul, humbling us, empowering us, melting us, tenderizing us,  humanizing us. Oh, Father, forgive us for not walking in a manner worthy of the gospel, which means we're just not thinking,  just not thinking until the power of it just begins to change us.

And we ask that you would also teach us how to wincently tell people that we found the cure. We pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

the Scriptures,  that He was buried,  that He was raised on the third day  according to the Scriptures,  and that He appeared to seephus,  and then to the 12. After that, He appeared to more than 500  of the brothers and sisters at the same time,  most of whom are still living,  though some have fallen asleep. Then He appeared to James,  then to all the apostles,  and last of all, He appeared to me also  as to one abnormally born. For I am the least of the apostles  and do not even deserve to be called an apostle,  because I persecuted the Church of God. But by the grace of God,  I am what I am,  and His grace to me was not without effect.

No, I worked harder than all of them,  yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me. Whether then it is I or they,  this is what we preach,  and this is what you believed. Here ends the reading. So we're looking at,  for a number of weeks,  we're looking at the subject of public faith. What does it mean to talk about  your deepest beliefs,  who you are,  with others in public,  who may not share your beliefs,  and how do you do that in a way  that's transparent, that's honest.

The same time is respectful. It promotes peace. This is something that everyone in the plural  is excited and needs to learn how to do. And we've been looking at this each week. And today you come to maybe perhaps  one of the more obvious things that you have to talk about.

We need to talk about  if we're going to discuss this subject. And that is what actually  are the core beliefs of Christianity. You can't talk in public about Christianity,  unless at some point you get down to say,  well, what is it? What are the core things that Christians believe? What do you believe in order to be a Christian?

And if you're going to do that,  there's no better spot in the whole Bible than here. Sure, there's other places in the Bible,  but this has a special place  because look,  at the passage it was just read to you. Paul says,  now brothers and sisters,  I want to remind you of the gospel. I preach to you that you received  by this you were saved,  and I had received it,  and I passed it on to you,  and it's a first importance of the very end,  he says,  so whether it's higher they,  meaning the others that are apostles,  this is what we preach,  and this is what you believed. What he is giving you is not only a gospel presentation.

He says,  here's the gospel I preached to you. I received it. You believed it. It saved you. But he's also speaking in the book of 1 Corinthians,  and there's an amazing amount of consensus  that 1 Corinthians was written just 20 years after  the death of Jesus Christ,  that it was perhaps the oldest  of all the peeps of literature we have in the New Testament.

And if that's the case,  then when Paul talks about this is what I did before,  he says,  remember when I came before,  I'm giving you a summary of the gospel  that I received,  that I gave you,  that you believed,  that saved you,  he's talking about something that happened just a handful of years  after Jesus' death. So if you want to get down to the foundations,  what is Christianity all about? What is Christianity believed? What is the irreducible core  that you must believe to be a Christian  and to have spiritual life? Here it is, right here.

And the reason why it's so important to keep in mind  if you're doing public talking about this in public  is if you're a Christian,  it is so important to major in the majors. There's lots and lots of things that Christians believe  and there's lots of things that different branches of Christian  Christianity believe,  and some of them may be very true,  very dear to your heart,  but you really should not press and push and talk  about beliefs that a lot of other Christians don't even share. You ought to major in the majors and hear the majors. And if you're skeptical of Christianity,  it's also crucial to get straight what Christianity really is. Over the years when people talk to me about how they're skeptical,  they really don't believe,  and I ask them,  well, what do you think Christianity teaches?

They tell me,  and as gently as possible,  I have to point out that that's not what Christianity teaches. I usually say something like,  I don't know a single church in the whole world that believes that. And of course,  I try to say it a nice tone,  but since I use this illustration in the beginning  and I realize,  that's not very gentle is it? No, maybe I shouldn't put it that way,  but the deal is,  do you really understand the Christianity you think you're rejecting? David Martin Lloyd-Jones,  great British preacher,  had a question that he used to ask people,  that he considered a diagnostic question.

It's a simple question,  and he would say,  do you consider yourself a Christian? And the person would say,  yes or no, he said,  well, why? And if a person says,  why do you think I'm a Christian? I think I'm trying hard to live according to the teachings of the Bible. I'm trying very hard to live like Christ.

I'm trying very hard to surrender and be like him. And Dr. Lloyd-Jones says,  if somebody gives an answer like that,  he knows that even though that's very, very typical,  very typical,  that that person doesn't really understand the gospel,  doesn't understand the core teachings. This is the gospel. What is it?

Well, let's just move right through it. There's actually four parts to this. The gospel is about Jesus. It's about sin and substitution. It's about history and resurrection.

And it's about astonishing, transforming grace. Just right through it. Okay, so first of all,  it's about Jesus,  because see, for what I received,  I passed on to you as a first importance,  and as soon as he begins,  his summary of the gospel, he says,  that Christ,  and actually, everything else,  in the whole paragraph,  is just a set of clauses or phrases that explain Christ. They all point back to Christ. The gospel is Christ, actually.

The gospel is Jesus Christ. Now, how would that be? Well, the word gospel,  though many people understand the word gospel means joyful news. That's what the Greek word technically means. It was actually used to announce a history-changing event.

It was the word that meant,  it was usually used to announce something like  the carnation of a new king,  the defeat of an invading army,  something like that,  some major news event. And if that's the core,  if the core of Christian teaching is a gospel,  then right away we're confronted with  what makes Christianity different from all of the religions. See, all of the religions contain  narratives about their founders, of course. All of the religions tell stories and have narratives  about the lives of their founders. But their founders, all the other religions,  their founders are teachers not saviors.

And because their teachers not saviors,  their life story is not the core of the core of those religions. The core of the core of those religions,  like the five pillars of Islam  or the eightfold path to enlightenment of Buddhism,  the core of the core of those religions  is always a set of directions about what you must do. Since the founders are teachers,  the core of the core of those religions  is a set of directions about what you must do. But the core of the core of Christianity is a gospel. That's not a set of directions about what you must do.

It's an account of what has been done. It's not actually advice. Christianity is not advice about what you must do. It's news. It's news about what he has done.

And in fact, one of the most striking things about this whole passage  is from verse three all the way to the end,  this description of the gospel,  there's nothing in here about what you must do. In fact, the gospel in here doesn't even contain  that you must repent and believe. Now, of course, you must repent and believe the gospel. If it's to be operative in your life,  and he says so up in verse two,  he says which you received,  and you took your stand on it. But see, technically,  that's a response to the gospel.

It's not actually part of the gospel. Why? Because the gospel is that nothing you can do,  nothing you will do,  nothing you have ever done can be the basis  for your acceptance with God. It all happens to what Jesus Christ has done. There's nothing you have done,  nothing you can do, nothing you will do,  nothing you do can be the basis for your acceptance with God.

It all comes to what Jesus Christ has done. So even repenting and believing is an actually part  of the gospel, technically,  it's a response to the gospel. And of course, the gospel brings massive changes to your life. It makes you an agent of reconciliation,  injustice, and love in the world. It profoundly changes your character.

It changes the very structure of your identity. It changes the very pathways of your heart. It changes the way your heart works. And yet, those are results of the gospel. You never find the authors of the scripture.

You never find the apostles or Paul ever loading that  into the gospel as if that's part of it. No. In a sense, the gospel is Jesus Christ. It is Jesus. So first of all, it's about Christ.

Secondly, though, it's about sin and substitution. Okay, so what's the first thing Jesus... Oh, we're told about Jesus. It says that Christ died for our sins. Die for our sins.

The very first thing, sin and substitution. First of all, sin. The first thing that we're told about what Jesus came to do  is deal with sin. We are uninformed and we need wisdom. Yes.

We are sufferers and we need help. We need support. We need relief. Yes. But, what we're learning here is,  first of all, we're sinners needing salvation.

That is to say, sin is our most fundamental human problem. And I got that takes a little bit of explanation. He said, why is that? Well, first of all, sin means that if God created you,  and if there is a God who created you  and who sustains you every single second,  and keeps you actually together from... You may say it's gravity.

Well, okay, where's that from? Or it's the way... It's the way, you know, the electrons stay in orbit  around the nucleus. What's keeping that together? You are being held together every second by God.

If there is a God who created you and sustains you  and who does all that,  then you owe him everything. Or, you owe it not to him just to pray  when you're in trouble or something like that. You owe it to live for him, to live for him totally. But sin is the teaching of the Bible. That, of course, you know this.

We don't live for him. We don't live for God. We don't live for our neighbor. We live for ourselves. We tend to live selfishly.

We've ruined the world. That's sin. But, well, see, to say he died for sin  means that that's our fundamental problem. Everything else comes from that because we're alienated from our maker. And we need...

The word alienation doesn't... You know, it's not used very much. But I want you to see how important it is. And I think I can do that by just giving you a simple illustration. Sin means we're personally and legally alienated from our maker.

There's a barrier there. And Jesus came to do something about it. And before he can do anything else,  he has to do that. So imagine you have a friend. You've been friends for a good long time.

Something changes. First, you notice your friend uses things that you give your friend  without acknowledgement, without gratitude. Then it gets worse. You find your friend lying to you, breaking promises,  and then lying to you. And finally, it gets terrible.

Your friend embezzles money from you because you're maybe in business together. We're just steals from you and robs from you. And after all this comes out, your friend sits down and says,  oh, can we stay friends because I really... I'll try to do better. I'll try to live better.

And I'm very sorry. And what are you going to say? Now, you'll use your own words. And you'll use your own words. But essentially, you're going to say,  hmm, we are in a state of alienation.

It's both legal and personal. Because what you're going to say is,  look, I know you're sorry. I guess you're sorry. And of course, if we're ever going to be friends again,  if this state of alienation is going to go away,  you will have to be sorry. But it won't be enough just to do better.

What are we going to do about what you did to me? You've robbed. There's a debt. There's a crime. Bad things have happened.

There's an injustice that has to be dealt with  if we are ever going to be friends again. See? Personal and legal. And of course, with God,  it would be writ infinitely larger  because you have an infinite God. Then you have an infinite debt.

You have an infinite crime. And there's a barrier. And that's the reason why Jesus could not come as a teacher. Because teachers come and say,  here's how you can be sorry and do a little better. That doesn't deal with the problem.

Doesn't deal with the alienation. Does it? Doesn't deal with the barrier. And Jesus came to deal with the barrier. How?

Substitution. This little word four is not very revealing to us  because our English word four, F-O-R,  covers such an enormous range of meanings. You have to have to sit and think and reflect before you know  in what way something is for something else. There's all sorts of categories. Fortunately, Greek had more prepositions that serviced.

And the preposition used here is who pair which means  on behalf of in the place of. As a substitute. This is saying that Jesus Christ died on behalf of us. He was a substitute. He died instead of us.

He took what we deserve. In other words, Jesus Christ took our place. The place we deserve to be cast out on the cross. And if we believe in Him,  then we get the place that He deserved at the table in the family. Love, child of God.

Second Corinthians 5, 21, God made Him sin, who knew no sin,  that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. Now, there's a lot of different metaphors  that the Bible uses to try to describe what happened on the cross. There's the language of the marketplace. Sometimes it talks about that Jesus Christ on the cross paid a price. Why?

Because sin is a debt. We just talked about that. And in the olden days, if you had a debt, you couldn't pay. You went into slavery until you could pay it. And Jesus Christ, we're told in the Bible, is our ransom.

He redeems us out of slavery. He pays the price. And so we're liberated. So you have the language of the marketplace and sin is a debt. Another kind of language is used to deal with the cross.

It's the language of the battlefield. You know why? Because sin is not just a debt. It's not just a legal debt. It's a powerful evil force.

It's in you and me. It makes us do things we hate. That's the reason why Paul, you know, in Romans 7 says,  very often I find I'm doing the very thing I hate. It absorbs us with ourselves and fills us with fears  and fills us with all sorts of things. And we do things we don't like to do.

It's a force inside. Of course, it's a force outside. People can wrong us. And Jesus Christ comes. And the Bible, some places talks about Jesus going to the cross  to defeat the powers of evil and sin and death.

And it's a terrible struggle. And he suffers horribly. But in the end, he fights and he wins for us. So there's the language of the marketplace, the language of the battlefield. There's also the language of the law court.

The language of the law court says that sin is also a violation of a standard. And if there is a God, you want him to be against evil and injustice, don't you? You don't want God to be passive. You don't want your God just to look on. You want him to do something about it.

You want him to be judicially wrathful against evil and injustice. But then to see if we have any evil in sin in us,  then that wrath, that judicial wrath, that condemnation lies on us,  but Jesus Christ comes and takes the punishment that we deserve. Now, as different as that is, there's others, there's others. But all those metaphors are wonderful because they show different aspects of the human problem  and they show different wonderful aspects of the rich salvation we have. But do you notice there's a thread running through all of them?

Every single one of them. Substitution. Jesus fights. Jesus pays. Jesus bears what we couldn't bear.

And that's the reason why John's thought in one of the best passages in all of his writings. He was an Anglican minister, British Anglican minister. He says that the concept of substitution is crucial to understand both sin and salvation. If you want to understand the gospel, you've got to understand substitution. Because on the one hand, what is sin?

It's you substituting yourself for God, putting yourself for only God deserves to be. In charge of your own life, you didn't make yourself. But see, when you say, I'm going to call the shots of my own life, what are you saying? I'm my own maker. I'm my own creator.

When you act as if you're your own maker and your creator and your own creator,  and you're not, it's kind of cosmic plagiarism, you know? And when you put yourself in that place and you're woefully under, by the way,  you're woefully under qualified for the job of being Lord of your life. Woefully under. See, sin is you substituting yourself for God. Well, salvation is God substituting himself for you, putting himself where you deserve to be.

God going to the cross and taking his own punishment. Now, sin is substitution. Very first thing out of Paul's mouth, when he's summarizing the thing that changed people's lives  at the beginning of the beginning of the Christian movement, at the core of the core of all Christian beliefs. And yeah, even though I love to run on and I want to go on,  I need to stop for a little bit because this, as important as this is,  as core as this is to Christianity, it flies right in the face of our culture. The idea that all people are sinners, that Jesus Christ had to go to the cross,  take our punishment, a swage, propitiate is the old word, the wrath of God,  satisfy the wrath of God, that just wrinkles at a hundred levels in our culture.

But I would like to just briefly, therefore, deal with a couple of issues, kind of loose ends. One is I would like to respond to the objection that this is a primitive bloodthirsty idea,  this idea of Jesus Christ going to the cross, substituting himself. And I'd also like to show you that this is the most democratic egalitarian, possible doctrine. So first of all, one of the charges is this whole idea that Jesus Christ goes  and He has to shed His blood in order to satisfy the punishment and wrath of God. Many people say, that's just incredible.

It's just like the ancient primitive pagan terrible religions. They're all bloody with all that sacrifice stuff. J.I. Packer in his great book, Knowing God, has a chapter in which he deals with this subject. And he brings out a perfect example of what people mean when they think about primitive pagan bloodthirsty religion.

He talks about the Iliad, Homer's Iliad. And in the Iliad, some of you know, probably from sixth grade, you know. The Greek army has taken ship to go to Troy. Remember because Prince Paris has taken Helen away. And the general of the Greek army, which was Agamemnon,  finds that they can't say, oh, why?

Because of contrary wins. Because the gods for some reason are angry at them. So Agamemnon sends for his daughter and ceremonially slaughters her as a sacrifice,  malifies the hostile gods. The old word was propitiation. He propities the wrath of the gods and then they can sail to Troy.

That was the, by the way, if you learn this in sixth grade, they probably left that part out. They left it out for me when I actually started reading. I said, why didn't they tell me the best stuff, you know. Well, people say, there we go. Oh, my word.

Here's a father who sacrifices his daughter, his child,  to malify the gods, to propitiate their wrath. This is terrible. And Christianity is just like that. It's primitive and bloodthirsty just like that. And J.R.

Packer says, no, no. Not only is it not like that, it's utterly different. Why? And here's what he says. He says, in paganism, man propituates his gods.

And religion becomes a form of commercialism and indeed of bribery. In Christianity, however, God propities his own wrath  through his own sacrificial action of love. See, as God comes in Jesus Christ and goes  and he takes his own punishment, it's utterly different. It's the reverse of ancient primitive bloodthirsty religion. Don't say that.

Now, secondly, I'd like to say something on the contrary about this doctrine of substitutionism. It's radically egalitarian and democratic. And if you think, you say, boy, that's kind of weird. I want you to look at the little word in here right in the beginning of the gospel presentation,  where Paul says Christ died for our sins. You know what's so interesting about that?

There's a world of meaning in that. Paul did not say for your sins. Paul was a Hebrew of the Hebrews. Paul tells us about what an incredibly fastidious, godly religious person he was. He poured over the Bible and he tried to find anything the Bible says that we should do.

And he did everything he possibly could in order to comply with every single aspect of God's law. And did everything he could. And yet here he is saying what? That Jesus Christ substituted himself and died for our sins, meaning I deserve to die too. My record deserves death.

Now, if that seems absolutely inexplicable to you, you need to read the book of Romans chapters one, two, and three,  where he, in a very top level summary of that. He spends one chapter talking about the pagans. Yes, the Gentiles, the people who didn't believe the Bible,  and they don't follow the biblical rules of chastity and purity and integrity and so on. But then he turns to people who believe the Bible. And he shows that though externally, they're obeying the Bible inside their motivation is not for love of God, but for love of self.

Inside their self-righteousness, there's pride. And he gets to chapter three, and he says, therefore, all have sinned and falls short of the glory of God. And he says, no one is righteous, no not one. No one is really even seeking for God. It's an amazing statement.

Because here's what Paul is saying. Paul is saying, the people that all of my life I was taught to despise, the Gentiles, the people that I wouldn't even want to eat with,  because they're unclean. They don't follow the Bible. The people that I've always despised, now I'm spending my whole life with. I'm spending my whole life with them.

Why? Because we're not really any different. He says, I'm really no better than a criminal that slits people's throats and takes their money. In the end, though, of course, we're lost in different ways. In the end, though, we violate the law of God in different ways.

In the end, we all fail to love God without our hard soul strength and our neighbors ourselves in different ways. And therefore, we're all equally sinners. We're all equally lost and we're all equally in need of God's grace. That is the most radically egalitarian humanizing doctrine there is. Look at Paul.

What turned him from a self-righteous racist into a person who embraces all people as his equals ought to say what? It was the gospel. It humanized him. Because every other religion and philosophy says this is what you must do to get saved. This is what you must do to find God.

This is what you must do to save the world. This is what you must do in order to be a good person or a moral person. In which case, there's always a bunch of people over here not doing what you think should be done. And therefore, you have to say, oh, look, they're not doing this. But see, Paul says it doesn't matter.

Liberal conservative, moral immoral, you know, avant-garde, respectable. This race, that race, it doesn't matter. We're all sinners. We're all in need of grace. How radically humanizing that is.

How radically egalitarian that is. You know why? Because we're all the problem with this world. You can't look in every, I think every other philosophy I know. Every other political platform I know.

Every other religion I know basically says we know what we should be doing. And these people over here are the problem with the world. And of course, Paul says, no, no, no, no. We're all the problem. You know, Agatha Christie's novel, Murder on the Orient Express.

It's her detective, Paul Rowe. It's stuck on a train, stuck in a snow drift. And a man is murdered. And he's trying to figure out who was the murderer. And he's on the train with 12 other passengers.

So which of the 12 has done the murder? So he's trying to figure it out. And this is the hardest one he's ever seen. Because all the clues are pointing in different ways. And he realizes he's missing something.

He's missing something. What is the key insight that will make sense of everything? What is the key insight that will make sense of everything? Well, the surprise answer, and I'm going to tell you. And if anybody complains about spoilers, I want you to know that this book has been out for 80 years.

And if you haven't read it or seen it, I don't want to hear it. You know what the key insight is? Everybody done it. All 12 people murdered the man together. And suddenly everything makes sense.

They're all the villains. They're all the murders. They're all in it. Okay. This is the clue the Gospel gives you,  without which your life won't make sense.

Society won't make sense. And history won't make sense. We're all in it. We're all in it. No one is right.

Just no not one. Most democratic, egalitarian doctrine. Okay, now thirdly. The third part of this Gospel presentation is the longest,  but it doesn't mean it necessarily is more important than the others. In some ways it's probably long.

It's about the resurrection of Jesus. It's probably longer because it's setting up the fact that the rest of the chapter  is going to be a lengthy, wonderful, remarkable treatment of the doctor of the resurrection  because it was an issue in the Corinthian church. But the point is he is now saying the third part is of the Gospel is history and the resurrection. He says that Christ died for sins according to the Scriptures. He was buried.

He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures. He appeared to seephus, that's Peter, then the twelve apostles after that he appeared  in more than 500 of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living,  then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, and last of all he appeared to me  and he's saying almost as if he had to come back and make a special trip  like I was born at the wrong time. But he even appeared to me. Now what's he talking about? The resurrection.

Why does the resurrection of Jesus Christ play an important role in the Gospel? It plays an important role because it's crucial to both, it's crucial in that the resurrection of Jesus  usures and secures are past and are future salvation. First of all, it usures and secures are past salvation. How do you know that Jesus dies on the cross actually paid for sins? How do you know it actually defeated sin?

How do you know that the punishment was taken? How do you know it's all paid? So that if you believe in him, there's no more condemnation for there. How do you know? Well see, if somebody was in debt in those days, they were either in slavery or maybe they'd be in prison.

And the only way you knew that the debt had been paid. And the way you could be sure you knew that debt had been paid was when they were released, when they were sprung. Then you knew that the debt had been paid. And of course, the wages of sin is death. And when Jesus Christ was sprung from death and he burst the bands of death, that's proof that it was paid.

That's proof that it was paid. If you're shopping in a store and you have a bag with some things you've already purchased,  there's nothing more unfortunate and kind of unpleasant than to have some plain clothesmen come up and say,  have you really bought those things? Let me look inside your bag. And you're irritated and you're feeling very bad, but what do you do? What you do is you reach in and you pull out what?

The receipt and you say, trouble me not. You say, be gone. Why? This is proof that your accusation has no merit. Do you know how to do that with a resurrection if you're a Christian?

Have you learned to do that yet? When your conscience goes after you, you've failed, you've done something really, really bad and it's killing you. Are you a Christian? Have you believed in Jesus Christ? Your conscience is killing.

Do you know how to get out the resurrection and say,  to your conscience, trouble me not? Be gone. This is my receipt. This proves that it was paid in full. This proves this stamps paid in full across history in such a way that nobody is ever going to miss it.

Do you know how to do that? So on the one hand, the resurrection assures and secures you, your past salvation,  but then secondly, it assures and secures the future salvation because our future salvation is not just  being forgiven and going and living in heaven as a soul. Our future is a resurrected body and a new heavens and a new earth and a place without suffering and death. Do you know what that's going to be like? What are our Tolkien in an essay called on fairy stories?

Try us to help us understand why we so love fairy tales or science fiction or what we call fantasy tales. We read them all the time. We watch them. We turn them into blockbuster pictures year after year after year. And then there you have magic and you have fantasy.

And he's trying to understand why in the world, especially in our modern age when we're very secular,  we're very scientific, and we know these stories are fiction. Why we still pour into the movie theater, we read the books, and we find ourselves moved. And he says, here's why, because these stories show us some things. They depict things that we long for, that we can't stop longing for. And here's what some of them are.

He says, we long for the ability to step outside of time. The idea of being able to step outside of time fascinates us. Secondly, we long for escape from death. Thirdly, we long for love without parting. Love that doesn't end.

It doesn't end with love without parting. Fourthly, we long. We're fascinated by the idea of having communication with non-human beings. And then lastly, he says, we actually, of course, long for a final defeat of evil. And so whenever we see these kinds of stories, they just fasten us.

We can never get enough of them because it scratches where we itch. We have this incredible longing for these things. But do you know that if the resurrection of Jesus Christ really happened  and if you believe in Him, all those things are actually literally going to come true? They're literally going to come true. And look, if you are skeptical of Christianity, okay, you're skeptical of Christianity,  but why wouldn't you want that to be true?

If you don't want that to be true, you're not being honest with yourself. And Christianity promises it. More than promises it. Essentially, it demonstrates it. It essentially proves it with a resurrection.

And that's the reason why he does all this. Why is he going on? He was seen by Seefus. He was seen by the 12th. He was seen by 500 people who are still, most of whom are still alive.

Richard Bauchem in his great book, Jesus and the eyewitnesses, points out that these are footnotes. See, if you're writing a serious academic work today, especially historical work,  you have to have footnotes. Why? Because your footnote basically says,  here's how you can find out that what I'm saying is right. So, for example, if you say, in such and such and such and such, this happened.

Well, what you do is you footnote the historical register in this particular library  where the original letter is or something like that. He says, footnotes are ways for you to say to the reader what I'm saying is true  and the footnote is a source from which you can find out that what I'm telling you is true. But see, in those days, if you're writing not legend, but history, how did you do a footnote? You said, here are the witnesses who are alive who saw it, you can go check. These are footnotes.

These are sources. And Paul was saying, there's hundreds of people who saw Jesus with their own eyes. Go talk to them. Most of them are still alive. There's only 20 years later at this point.

Do you see what that means? Paul is saying, the resurrection was not a symbol. It's not a nice story. It's not a legend. It's come down to us through the ages.

People saw him. There is evidence. And if that's the case and the stuff that you most long for in life,  the kind of world you most long for is available. It's there. Believe the gospel.

Look, at the very, very end. This ending is technically a testimony and is wonderful. Because see, the gospel ultimately is personal. It's not just a set up bullet points. And he says, for I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle,  because I persecuted the Church of God.

But by the grace of God, I am what I am. And his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than them all. Yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me. Look at three things, as we just said.

First of all, this is the gospels about grace. Notice three times he uses the word. The gospel is about grace, grace, grace. The reason my Lloyd Jones could use that diagnostic question and say to people,  are you a Christian? And if they said, well, I'm trying, trying very hard,  the reason he knew that they didn't understand the core of Christianity was because they didn't understand grace.

They're basically saying, well, if I work hard enough, then maybe God will bless me. Oh, my word. Do you, John Bunion, who wrote Pilgrim's progress in his autobiography,  Grace Abounding to the Truth, to the chief of sinners,  tells a story of how he probably got converted. He had been reading the Bible, and it just made him feel more guilty. But he said, one day, he just thought of something.

And he says in here, he says, one day, as I was passing through a field,  suddenly I thought of a sentence, a sentence. Your righteousness is in heaven. And he explains how then, with the eyes of faith, putting together things he'd read in the Bible,  he says, with the eyes of faith, I saw Christ sitting at God's right hand, and suddenly I realized,  there's my righteousness. God could not say, where is your righteousness today, for it was always right in front of him. My good frame of heart could not make my righteousness better, nor a bad frame of heart,  make my righteousness worse.

My righteousness was Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. And now my chains fell off indeed. I felt delivered from slavery to guilt and fears, and I saw that all those weak character qualities in my heart  were like the pennies that a rich man carries in his pocket when his goal is safe in a trunk at home. Grace, get grace until the grace penny drops you haven't got the gospel. Secondly, however, grace does not mean, okay, well, you're just accepted.

That's all there is to it, doesn't change you, of course it changes you, because he says, what? His grace to me was not without effect. Boy, and that is the understatement of the year. Because what he says is, I hated Christianity, and what he doesn't say is, I'm a brilliant man. See, Paul is one of the most influential people in the history of the world.

He was brilliant, and he hated Christianity, and yet Grace changed him. Well, how can Grace change you? Well, because Grace is undeserved, once you realize that God's grace is undeserved, it humbles you. But then when you also realize that Grace is unconditional, because it's undeserved, it takes you down. I'm no different than anybody else, but because it's unconditional, it brings you back up.

I'm always accepted, I'm always loved, peace, boldness, but because it was costly, it's absolutely free to you, God's grace. But it's infinitely costly to him, because of what he had to go through on the cross. It turns you into a sacrificial lover of other people. It was not without effect, it was not without effect. And lastly, it just fills you with wonder.

You see, he's almost, I just kind of amazed at himself. He's just looking at me saying, but by the grace of God, I am what I am. When you say something, when you, you know, Kathy pointed out to me that this week in the Tuesday of Science Times of the New York Times,  it talks about the fact that we're probably on the verge of finding a cure for hep C, which is a disease, by the way,  that kills more people than AIDS. It just gives you a miserable life while it's killing you. And it looks like possibly, they went to pains to say it's not for certain, but it looks like there's not just a vaccine, but a pill, just a pill, not even a vaccine,  that you take, and it can take it out of your body in a couple of months.

And of course, everybody who's hearing about it, they're just excited, they're astounded, they're amazed, they're telling each other, they're rushing. Of course, you're going to be like that. Of course, you're going to be like, think of the joy of knowing that the death sentence that was over you is taken away. Or are you going to tell everybody about it? Aren't you going to be amazed?

Well, listen, the gospel would be way more than that. We're talking about not just extending your life a few years. We're talking about love without parting, escape from death, communication with non-human beings. We're talking about everything you've ever wanted. How could you not be filled with joy?

How could you not want to tell people that it's praying? Our Father, we thank you for the gospel. We thank you for the glad, joyful tidings of the gospel. And we ask that the undeservedness, the unconditional nature of it, the costliness of it,  would change us the way it changed Paul, humbling us, empowering us, melting us, tenderizing us,  humanizing us. Oh, Father, forgive us for not walking in a manner worthy of the gospel, which means we're just not thinking,  just not thinking until the power of it just begins to change us.

And we ask that you would also teach us how to wincently tell people that we found the cure. We pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.

### 中文翻译

照着圣经说的，他被埋葬了；又照着圣经说的，第三天他复活了；并且他向矶法显现，然后向十二使徒显现。此后，他又同时向五百多位弟兄姊妹显现，其中大多数如今还在，虽然也有些已经睡了。随后他向雅各显现，再向众使徒显现；末了也向我显现，好像向一个未到产期而生的人。我原是使徒中最小的，不配称为使徒，因为我从前逼迫神的教会。然而我今日成了何等人，是蒙神的恩才成的；并且他所赐给我的恩不是徒然的。

不，我比众使徒格外劳苦；然而不是我，乃是神的恩与我同在。无论是我，是他们，我们如此传，你们也如此信。读经到此结束。

我们连续好几个星期在看一个主题：公共信仰。把你最深的信念、你是谁，拿到公共场合与别人谈论——那些人可能并不认同你的信念——这到底意味着什么？你又如何以一种透明、诚实的方式去做？

同时又要尊重人，促进和平。这是一个多元社会里每个人都在意、也都需要学习怎么做的事。我们每周都在讨论这个。今天我们来到一个也许是你必须谈到的、最显而易见的方面。

如果我们要讨论这个主题，就必须谈一件事：基督信仰的核心信念到底是什么。你不可能在公共场合谈基督教，除非在某个时刻你真的落到这一点上：它到底是什么？基督徒相信的核心是什么？要成为基督徒，你必须相信什么？

若要这样做，整本圣经里没有比这里更好的地方。当然，圣经里还有别处，但这一段有一种特殊地位。你看，刚读给你们听的经文里，保罗说：“弟兄姊妹，我要提醒你们我所传给你们的福音；你们领受了它，靠着它得救；我自己也领受了，又传给你们；这是最重要的。”到最后他又说：“无论是我，是他们（指其他使徒），我们如此传，你们也如此信。”他给你的不只是一个“福音呈现”。

他是在说：“这就是我传给你们的福音。我领受了它。你们信了它。它救了你们。”而且他是在《哥林多前书》里说这些。学界有一个惊人的共识：哥林多前书写作时间大约在耶稣基督死后仅二十年，可能是我们在新约里所拥有的最早的一批文字作品。

如果真是这样，那么当保罗说“我从前所做的事”时——“记得我先前来过”——他是在给你一个他所领受、传给你们、你们信了并因此得救的福音摘要；他说的是耶稣死后不过短短几年内发生的事情。所以，如果你想追溯根基：基督信仰到底在讲什么？基督教信什么？那不可再简化的核心是什么——你必须相信它，才能成为基督徒、拥有属灵生命？就在这里。

而这件事之所以在你进行公共对话时格外重要，是因为：如果你是基督徒，务必要抓住“主要的事”。基督徒相信的事情很多，不同的基督教传统也有很多不同的信念；其中一些也许非常真实、非常珍贵，深深贴近你的心，但你不该把那些许多其他基督徒都不一定认同的观点拿来强压、推销、反复谈论。你要抓住最主要的，讲清楚最主要的。

如果你对基督信仰持怀疑态度，同样也必须先弄清楚：基督教到底是什么。多年来，有人跟我谈他们为什么怀疑、为什么不信；我就问：“你认为基督教教导什么？”他们告诉我之后，我不得不尽可能温和地指出：那并不是基督教的教导。我通常会说类似这样的话：“我不知道世界上有哪一间教会会相信那个。”当然，我尽量语气和善；不过我开头用的这个例子，现在想想，这也不算很温柔，是不是？也许我不该那样说。但关键是：你真的明白你以为自己在拒绝的那个基督教吗？

大卫·马丁·劳埃德-琼斯（David Martyn Lloyd-Jones），一位伟大的英国传道人，有一个他常用来问人的问题，他把它当作诊断性问题。

这是个很简单的问题。他会说：“你认为自己是基督徒吗？”对方回答“是”或“不是”。他接着问：“为什么？”如果一个人说：“你为什么觉得我是基督徒？因为我很努力照着圣经的教导生活；我很努力像基督；我很努力降服、活得像他。”劳埃德-琼斯博士说：若有人这样回答，他就知道——尽管这非常典型、非常非常典型——这个人并不真正明白福音，不明白核心教义。这就是福音。它是什么？

我们就顺着经文往下走。这里其实有四个部分：福音关乎耶稣；关乎罪与代替；关乎历史与复活；也关乎令人震撼、带来转变的恩典。我们就一项一项看。

第一，福音关乎耶稣。因为保罗说：“我所领受的又传给你们，最重要的就是：基督……”你注意到他一开始总结福音就说“基督”，而整段其余部分其实都是一连串从句或短语来说明“基督”。它们都指回基督。福音其实就是基督。

福音就是耶稣基督。怎么会这样？“福音”这个词，很多人知道它的意思是“好消息”。这确实是这个希腊词在技术上的含义。但它原本是用来宣告一个足以改变历史的事件。

这个词通常用于宣布诸如新王加冕、入侵军被击败之类的大事——某种重大的新闻事件。如果基督教教导的核心是“福音”，那么我们马上就被迫面对：是什么使基督教不同于所有宗教。

你看，所有宗教当然都有关于其创立者的叙事。所有宗教都会讲故事、会叙述他们创立者的生平。但在其他宗教里，他们的创立者是老师，不是救主。

正因为他们是老师不是救主，他们的人生故事就不是那些宗教“核心中的核心”。那些宗教的核心——比如伊斯兰的五功、佛教通向觉悟的八正道——永远是一套指示：你必须做什么。

既然创立者是老师，那些宗教的核心就是一套你必须去做的指引。但基督教的核心之核心是“福音”。那不是一套你必须做什么的指引。

它是对“已经成就之事”的叙述。它不是建议。基督教不是关于你必须做什么的忠告；它是新闻，是关于他已经做成了什么的新闻。

事实上，这段经文最醒目的地方之一是：从第3节一直到末尾，这个对福音的描述里，没有任何关于“你必须做什么”。甚至连“你必须悔改并相信”都没有包含在其中。当然，你必须悔改、相信福音，福音才会在你生命里发生功效；保罗在第2节上面也说了：“你们领受了它，并且靠它站立得住。”

但你看，严格来说，那是对福音的回应，并不是福音本身的一部分。为什么？因为福音就是：你所能做的、将要做的、曾经做过的任何事，都不能成为你被神接纳的基础。基础完全在于耶稣基督所做成的事。

你做过什么、你能做什么、你将要做什么，都不能成为你被神接纳的根基。全都归结为耶稣基督所成就的。

所以，连悔改和相信，从严格意义上说也不是福音的一部分，而是对福音的回应。当然，福音会带来生命巨大的改变：它使你成为世上和好的使者、正义与爱的实践者；它深刻地改变你的品格，改变你身份认同的结构，改变你内心的路径，改变你心如何运作。

然而，这些都是福音的结果。你从不会看到圣经作者——你从不会看到使徒或保罗——把这些“装进”福音里，好像它们属于福音本体。不是的。

在某种意义上，福音就是耶稣基督，就是耶稣。所以第一，福音关乎基督。

第二，福音关乎罪与代替。我们被告知耶稣做的第一件事是什么？经文说：“基督为我们的罪死了。”为我们的罪而死。

开头第一件事：罪与代替。先说罪。关于耶稣来做什么，我们首先被告知的是：他来处理罪。

我们无知，需要智慧。是的。我们受苦，需要帮助、支持、缓解。是的。但我们在这里学到的是：首先，我们是需要拯救的罪人。

也就是说，罪是人类最根本的问题。我知道这需要一点解释。你会说：为什么？

首先，罪意味着：如果神创造了你，如果确实有一位神创造你，并且每一秒钟都托住你、维系你——让你不至于散架。你也许说是重力。

好吧，那重力从哪里来？或者你说是某种机制——电子绕着原子核运行；是什么使它保持在一起？你每一秒都在被神托住。

如果有一位神创造你、托住你、做这一切，那么你就欠他一切。你欠他的不只是你遇到麻烦时才祷告一下；你欠他的，是完全为他而活、彻底为他而活。

但圣经教导说——你当然知道——我们并不为他活。我们不为神活，也不为邻舍活，我们为自己活。我们倾向于自私地活。

我们毁坏了这个世界。这就是罪。

可是你看，说“他为罪而死”，就意味着罪是我们最根本的问题。其他一切都从这里而来，因为我们与造物主隔绝了。

“隔绝”这个词不常用，但我希望你看见它的重要性。我用一个简单例子来说明。罪意味着我们在位格上、在法律上都与造物主隔绝。

中间有一道屏障，而耶稣来就是要处理这件事。在他做其他任何事之前，他必须先处理这一点。

想象你有一个朋友，你们做朋友很久了。后来发生了变化。起初你注意到：你送给朋友的东西，他在使用却不致谢、不感恩。然后更糟：你发现朋友对你撒谎、违背承诺，然后又对你撒谎。

最后变得很严重：如果你们一起做生意，你的朋友侵吞你的钱——就是偷你、抢你。事情曝光后，你的朋友坐下来对你说：“我们还能做朋友吗？我真的……我会努力变好，我会努力过得更好。我很抱歉。”你会怎么说？

你会用自己的话来说。但实质上你会说：“嗯，我们处在一种隔绝状态里。”这既是法律上的，也是关系上的。

因为你会说：“我知道你说你抱歉，我想你确实抱歉。若我们要再做朋友，这种隔绝状态必须消除，你当然得抱歉。但光是‘以后做得更好’还不够。”

“我们要怎么处理你对我做过的事？你抢了我，有债务，有犯罪，有坏事发生；若我们要再做朋友，必须先处理这份不公。”

看到没有？个人与法律层面。

而在神那里，这一切被无限放大，因为你面对的是无限的神，于是你就有无限的债、无限的罪、无限的屏障。

这就是为什么耶稣不能只作为一位老师来。老师来会说：“你该怎样懊悔，怎样做得好一点。”但那并没有解决问题。

它并没有解决隔绝，不是吗？并没有拆除屏障。而耶稣来就是要处理屏障。怎么处理？

代替。

这里的“为”这个小词，在英文里并不显眼，因为英文的 for（F-O-R）涵盖的意义范围太大；你得坐下来想一想，才能知道某件事“为”另一件事究竟是哪一种“为”。有许多类别。幸好希腊语有更多介词来服务这种差别。

这里用的介词是 huper，意思是“为……的缘故”“代替……”“代表……”“站在……的位置上”。作为替代。

这句话是在说：耶稣基督为我们死了，他是代替者；他替我们而死。

他承担了我们该受的。在别的说法里：耶稣基督替我们站了位。

我们该被弃绝、该被钉十字架的位置，他站了；而若我们信他，我们就得着他配得的那个位置——在家中、在桌前——蒙爱、作神的儿女。

哥林多后书5章21节说：“神使那无罪的，替我们成为罪，好叫我们在他里面成为神的义。”

圣经用许多隐喻来描述十字架上发生了什么：有市场的语言，有时说耶稣基督在十字架上付了代价。为什么？因为罪是一笔债，我们刚刚谈过。

在古代，你若有债还不起，就会成为奴隶，直到还清。圣经说耶稣基督是我们的赎价：他把我们从奴役中赎出来，他付清代价，于是我们得自由。

所以有市场的语言：罪是债。

还有一种用于十字架的语言，是战场的语言。为什么？因为罪不只是债，不只是法律层面的债；它还是一种强大的邪恶力量。

它在你我里面，使我们做我们恨恶的事。这就是保罗在罗马书7章说的：“我常常发现自己正在做我所恨恶的事。”它把我们吸进自我，充满惧怕，充满各样东西，使我们去做我们不愿做的事。

它是内在的力量；当然也有外在的力量——人会伤害我们。耶稣基督来到，有些地方圣经说他上十字架是为了打败邪恶、罪与死亡的权势。

那是一场可怕的争战，他受极深的苦；但最终他为我们争战并得胜。

所以有市场的语言，有战场的语言；还有法庭的语言。

法庭的语言说：罪也是对标准的违犯。若有一位神，你会希望他反对邪恶与不公义，对吗？你不希望神是被动的，不希望你的神只是旁观。

你希望他对邪恶与不公义有司法性的愤怒，并采取行动。但若我们里面也有罪与恶，那么那愤怒——那司法性的愤怒、那定罪——就落在我们身上。

而耶稣基督来到，承担我们该受的刑罚。

当然还有别的隐喻。但这些隐喻都很美，因为它们展现人类问题的不同面向，也展现我们丰富救恩中不同而美妙的面向。

但你注意到贯穿其中的一条线吗？每一个隐喻、每一个都一样：代替。

耶稣争战；耶稣付代价；耶稣承担我们承担不了的。

这就是为什么约翰·斯托得（John Stott）在他著作中一段最精彩的文字里说：代替这一概念对于理解罪与救恩都至关重要。若你要明白福音，就必须明白代替。

因为一方面，什么是罪？就是你用自己替代神，把自己放在只有神配得的位置上。

你掌控自己的人生，但你并不是造自己的人。当你说“我要决定我自己的人生”，你在说什么？你在说“我是自己的造物主”。

当你把自己当作自己的造物主，而你并不是，那就像一种宇宙级的剽窃。

而当你把自己放在那个位置上时，顺便说一句，你严重不够资格担任“你生命的主”这份工作——严重不够。

所以罪就是你以自己替代神；而救恩就是神以自己替代你，把自己放在你该在的位置上。

神在耶稣基督里上十字架，承担他自己的刑罚。

罪是代替。保罗总结那改变人生命的事——基督教运动最初之初发生的事、所有基督信仰的核心之核心——他一开口讲的第一件事，就是这个。

我本来很想继续讲下去，但我需要停一下。因为这虽是基督信仰最核心、最重要的内容，却在我们的文化里会在许多层面引发强烈反感：所有人都是罪人、耶稣基督必须上十字架替我们受罚、平息（旧译常用“挽回”）神的忿怒、满足神的忿怒——这些在我们的文化里会让人从很多层面皱眉。

因此我想简短处理两个反对意见、两个“尾巴”。第一，我想回应一种批评：说这是原始、嗜血的观念——耶稣基督上十字架流血、替代人、满足神的忿怒。第二，我也想告诉你：这其实是最民主、最平等的教义之一。

先说第一点：有人指责说，耶稣基督必须流血来满足神的刑罚与忿怒，这听起来太不可思议了。

“这就像古代那些原始、可怕的异教宗教：全是血腥的献祭。”

J. I. 巴刻（J.I. Packer）在他的名著《认识神》（Knowing God）里有一章专门讨论这个。他举了一个完美例子来说明人们所谓原始、嗜血的宗教是什么样。

他谈到《伊利亚特》（Homer’s Iliad）。你们中有些人也许在六年级学过。希腊军队乘船要去特洛伊，因为帕里斯王子把海伦带走了。希腊军队的统帅阿伽门农发现他们无法启航。为什么？因为逆风。因为诸神不知为何对他们发怒。

于是阿伽门农把女儿叫来，举行仪式把她宰杀，作为祭物，以安抚那些敌对的神。旧词叫“propitiation”（挽回/平息）。他挽回诸神的忿怒，然后他们就能驶向特洛伊。

顺便说一句，如果你六年级学过这个，他们大概把这一段略去了。我当年开始自己读时就想：为什么不告诉我最精彩的部分呢？

人们说：“看吧！这里有一个父亲牺牲自己的女儿、自己的孩子，来安抚诸神、挽回他们的忿怒。太可怕了。基督教也是这样：原始、嗜血。”

而巴刻说：“不，不。它不仅不像那样，它完全相反。为什么？”他这样说：

“在异教中，人去挽回他的诸神；宗教就成了一种商业行为，甚至是一种贿赂。在基督教里，然而，是神借着他自己出于爱的献祭行动，挽回他自己的忿怒。”

也就是说，神在耶稣基督里来到，承担他自己的刑罚。这完全不同；它正好与古代原始嗜血宗教相反。不要这样说。

第二，我想就“代替”这个教义说一句相反的话：它是彻底的平等主义、民主性的。

你也许会说：“这很奇怪。”我希望你注意福音呈现开头那个小词：保罗说“基督为我们的罪死了”。

你知道这句话里有多大的含义吗？保罗没有说“为你们的罪”，他说“为我们的罪”。

保罗是“希伯来人中的希伯来人”。保罗自己说过他是多么严谨、敬虔、宗教上极其讲究的人。他细读圣经，努力找出圣经要我们做的每一件事，并竭尽所能遵行神律法的每一项。

然而他在这里说什么？他说耶稣基督替我们死在十字架上，为我们的罪死，意思是：我也该死。我的记录也该死。

如果这对你来说完全不可思议，你就该去读罗马书第1、2、3章。那里他在更高层次的概括里做了说明。

他用一章谈外邦人——不信圣经的人——他们不遵循圣经关于贞洁、纯洁、正直等的规范。

但接着他转向那些信圣经的人，并指出：虽然他们外在遵行圣经，但内在动机不是爱神，而是爱自己。

他们的自义里有骄傲。

到了第三章，他说：“因为世人都犯了罪，亏缺了神的荣耀。”又说：“没有义人，连一个也没有；没有人真正寻求神。”这是极其惊人的陈述。

因为保罗在说：我一生被教导要鄙视的人——外邦人，那些我甚至不愿与之同席吃饭的人，因为他们不洁，不遵循圣经——那些我一直鄙视的人，如今我把一生都与他们在一起。

为什么？因为我们并没有本质不同。

他说：我并不比一个割人喉咙抢钱的罪犯更好。最终我们只是以不同方式迷失、以不同方式违反神的律法；最终我们都以不同方式没有尽心、尽性、尽意、尽力爱神，也没有爱邻舍如同自己。

因此我们都同样是罪人，同样失丧，同样需要神的恩典。这是最激进、最平等、最能使人得人性尊严的教义。

看保罗：是什么把他从一个自义的种族主义者变成一个拥抱万民、把众人当作平等的人？是什么？是福音。

它使他成为真正的人。

因为所有其他宗教与哲学都说：“你必须做这些，才能得救；你必须做这些，才能找到神；你必须做这些，才能拯救世界；你必须做这些，才能成为好人或有道德的人。”那样一来，总会有一群人没有在做你认为该做的事，因此你就会说：“看，他们没有做这个。”

但保罗说：无所谓。

自由派、保守派，道德的、不道德的，前卫的、体面的；这个种族、那个种族——都无所谓。我们都是罪人，我们都需要恩典。

这多么深刻地使人得人性尊严，多么平等。

你知道为什么吗？因为我们每一个人都是这个世界的问题。

我想几乎我所知道的所有其他哲学、所有其他政治纲领、所有其他宗教基本都说：“我们知道该做什么；世界的问题是那边那些人。”

但保罗说：“不，不，不，我们都是问题。”

阿加莎·克里斯蒂的小说《东方快车谋杀案》。她的侦探波洛被困在一列火车上，火车被大雪困住。一个人被谋杀了，他要找出凶手。

车上还有十二位乘客。那么，是这十二个人中的哪一个干的？他努力推理。

这是他见过最难的一案，因为所有线索指向不同方向。他意识到自己漏掉了关键。他漏掉了什么？有什么洞见能让一切变得清楚？

结局的惊人答案——我要告诉你——如果有人抱怨剧透，我要说这本书已经出版八十年了，你若还没读也没看，我不想听抱怨。

关键洞见是什么？每个人都干了。十二个人一起杀了那个人。突然一切都说得通了。

他们全都是坏人，全都是凶手，全都参与其中。

这就是福音给你的线索；没有它，你的人生不会说得通，社会不会说得通，历史也不会说得通：我们都在其中。我们都在其中。

没有义人，连一个也没有。

最民主、最平等的教义。

好，第三点。

这段福音呈现的第三部分是最长的，但并不表示它比其他部分更重要。某种意义上它之所以长，可能是因为它在为整章做铺垫：后面整章将会对“复活的教义”做长篇、精彩、非凡的论述，因为这是哥林多教会的一个争议。

重点是：他现在说福音第三部分关乎历史与复活。

他说：基督照着圣经为罪死了；他被埋葬了；照着圣经第三天复活了；他向矶法（就是彼得）显现，然后向十二使徒显现；之后又向五百多位弟兄姊妹显现，多数还活着；又向雅各显现；再向众使徒显现；最后向我显现。

他几乎是在说：好像他得特别回来一趟，因为我像是生不逢时、未到产期而生的人，但他也向我显现了。

他在说什么？复活。

为什么耶稣基督的复活在福音里扮演重要角色？因为复活对于确保我们过去的救恩与未来的救恩都至关重要。

首先，它确保我们过去的救恩。你怎么知道耶稣死在十字架上真的为罪付了代价？你怎么知道它真的胜过了罪？你怎么知道刑罚真的被承担了？你怎么知道都付清了？以至于你若信他，就不再被定罪。

你怎么知道？

你看，在古代，如果一个人欠债，他要么成了奴隶，要么进了监狱。

你唯一能确定债已还清的方式，就是当他被释放、被放出来。

你就知道债付清了。

而罪的工价乃是死。当耶稣基督从死亡中被释放、冲破死亡的捆绑，那就是证明：已经付清。

那就是证明：已经付清。

你在商店买东西，袋子里装着你已经付过钱的物品。最糟、最不舒服的一种情况，就是有便衣上来对你说：“你真的买了吗？让我看看你的袋子。”

你很恼火、很难受，但你会怎么做？你会伸手拿出什么？收据。

你会说：“别再烦我。走开。”

为什么？因为那张收据证明：你的指控毫无根据。

基督徒，你知道怎么用复活来做这件事吗？你学会了吗？

当你的良心追着你不放，你失败了，你做了非常非常糟的事，你被压得喘不过气。

你是基督徒吗？你信靠耶稣基督吗？你的良心在控告你。

你知道怎么把复活拿出来，对你的良心说：“别再烦我。走开。这就是我的收据。这证明已经付清。这在历史上用一种任何人都无法忽视的方式盖上了‘全额付清’的印章。”

你知道怎么做吗？

所以一方面，复活保证并确证你过去的救恩；但另一方面，它也保证并确证未来的救恩，因为我们的未来救恩不只是“被赦免然后在天堂作一个灵魂活着”。我们的未来是复活的身体，是新天新地，是一个没有痛苦与死亡的地方。

你知道那会是什么样吗？

托尔金在一篇文章《论童话故事》（On Fairy-Stories）里试着帮助我们理解：为什么我们如此喜爱童话、科幻或我们称为奇幻的故事。我们不断阅读、不断观看，每年一次又一次把它们拍成卖座大片。

故事里有魔法、有幻想。

他想弄明白：为什么在现代这个很世俗、很科学的时代，我们明知这些是虚构，仍旧涌进电影院、读这些书，并且被深深触动。

他说：原因在于这些故事向我们呈现了一些东西——它们描绘了我们渴望却无法停止渴望的事。

比如，他说：我们渴望能够走出时间。能够走出时间的想法令我们着迷。

第二，我们渴望逃离死亡。

第三，我们渴望没有离别的爱——不结束的爱。

第四，我们渴望、也被“与非人类存在交流沟通”的想法吸引。

最后，他说，我们当然渴望邪恶最终被彻底击败。

因此每当我们看到这类故事，就会被紧紧抓住。我们永远看不够，因为它挠到了我们的痒处——我们对这些事有难以置信的渴望。

但你知道吗？如果耶稣基督的复活真的发生，而你信靠他，那么这些事情将会字面意义上成真。它们将会真实地发生。

而且你看，如果你对基督信仰感到怀疑——你怀疑基督教——但你为什么不希望这是真的？如果你不希望这是真的，你对自己并不诚实。

基督教不只是承诺它，某种意义上它还展示它、用复活来证明它。

这就是为什么保罗要讲这么多：他被矶法看见，被十二看见，被五百人看见，其中多数仍活着。

理查德·鲍克姆（Richard Bauckham）在他的名著《耶稣与目击者》（Jesus and the Eyewitnesses）里指出：这些其实就是脚注。

你看，今天你写严肃的学术作品，尤其历史研究，你必须有脚注。为什么？因为脚注基本上是在说：“你可以用这些来源核实我所说的是真的。”

例如你说：在某年某月某地发生了某事。你会脚注一个历史档案、某个图书馆里保存的原始信件之类。他说：脚注就是给读者的路线图，告诉他你所说的是真实的，以及到哪里去核实。

但在那个时代，如果你写的不是传说而是历史，你怎么做脚注？你就说：这些见证人还活着，你可以去问他们、去核实。

这些就是脚注，这些就是来源。

保罗是在说：有数百人亲眼看见耶稣。你去找他们谈。多数还活着。现在离那事发生不过二十年。

你明白这意味着什么吗？保罗是在说：复活不是象征，不是一个温馨的故事，不是一个随岁月流传下来的传说。

有人见过他。有证据。

如果是这样，那么你生命里最深的渴望、你最渴望的那种世界，是可得的，是存在的。信福音吧。

看最后这一段。严格来说，这结尾是见证，非常美。

因为福音最终是个人性的，不只是几条要点。

他说：“我原是使徒中最小的，不配称为使徒，因为我从前逼迫神的教会。然而我今日成了何等人，是蒙神的恩才成的；并且他所赐给我的恩不是徒然的。不，我比众使徒格外劳苦；然而不是我，乃是神的恩与我同在。”

留意三件事。

第一，福音关乎恩典。

注意他三次使用这个词。福音是关于恩典、恩典、恩典。

这就是为什么劳埃德-琼斯能用那个诊断问题：你是基督徒吗？如果他们说：“我很努力、很努力。”他就知道他们不明白基督教的核心，因为他们不明白恩典。

他们基本是在说：“只要我够努力，也许神就会赐福我。”天哪。

你知道约翰·班扬（John Bunyan）吗？他写了《天路历程》（Pilgrim’s Progress）。他在自传《恩典丰沛》（Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners）里讲了一个故事：他大概是怎样悔改归主的。

他一直读圣经，却只感到更深的罪疚。

但有一天，他忽然想到一句话——一句话。

“你的义在天上。”

他解释说：凭着信心的眼睛，把他在圣经里读到的东西串起来，他仿佛看见基督坐在神的右边，他突然明白：那就是我的义。

神不可能问我：“你今日的义在哪里？”因为我的义总是在他面前。

我好的心境不能让我的义更好；我坏的心境也不能让我的义更坏。

我的义就是耶稣基督，昨日今日直到永远一样。

于是我的锁链真的脱落了。我觉得自己从对罪疚与恐惧的奴役中被释放；我看见我心里那些软弱的性情，像是富人随身口袋里的几个便士，而他的财宝安全地存放在家里的箱子里。

恩典——直到“恩典的那一分钱”掉下来，你就还没有福音。

第二，恩典并不意味着：“好吧，你只是被接纳了，事情就这样了，也不改变你。”当然它会改变你。

因为保罗说：“他赐给我的恩不是徒然的。”这简直是年度最轻描淡写的一句话。

因为他的意思是：我曾恨基督教。而他没有说的是：我也是个极其聪明的人。

保罗是世界历史上最有影响力的人物之一。

他才智卓越，却恨基督教；然而恩典改变了他。

恩典怎么会改变你？因为恩典是不配得的，当你意识到神的恩典是不配得的，它使你谦卑。

但当你也意识到恩典是无条件的——正因为不配得——它先把你压下去：“我并不比任何人更好”；又把你托起来：“我永远被接纳、永远被爱。”

于是你有平安，有胆量。

并且因为它是有代价的——对你完全白白赐下——却对他代价无限，因为他在十字架上所经历的一切——它会把你变成一个愿意为别人舍己的爱人。

“不是徒然的”，绝不是徒然的。

第三，它使你充满惊奇。

你看，他几乎在对自己感到惊讶。他仿佛看着自己说：“然而我今日成了何等人，是蒙神的恩才成的。”

当你听到某件事——本周《纽约时报》科学版星期二的那一期，凯西提醒我，上面谈到我们可能正处在找到丙型肝炎（hep C）治愈方法的门槛上。顺便说，这种病致死人数比艾滋病还多；它在杀死你之前会让你过得很痛苦。

看起来可能——他们也很谨慎地说尚不确定——但看起来不仅有疫苗，甚至有一种药片：只是一颗药片，不是疫苗，你吃了，在几个月内就能把病毒从体内清除。

当然，每一个听到的人都会兴奋、震惊、惊叹，会彼此转告，会奔走相告。

你当然会这样。想想看：原本悬在你头上的死刑被取消了，那喜乐何等大。你难道不会告诉所有人吗？你难道不会惊叹吗？

可是请听：福音远远超过这个。

我们讲的不只是把你的生命延长几年。

我们讲的是没有离别的爱、逃离死亡、与非人类存在的交流。

我们讲的是你所渴望的一切。

你怎么可能不充满喜乐？你怎么可能不想告诉别人：这是真的？

我们祷告说：我们在天上的父，我们感谢你赐下福音。

我们感谢你赐下福音这喜乐的好消息。

我们求你：让它那不配得、无条件、且极其昂贵的性质，像改变保罗一样改变我们——使我们谦卑，使我们得能力，使我们融化，使我们柔软，使我们更有人性。

父啊，求你赦免我们没有按福音相称的方式行事；其实是因为我们没有思考——没有思考，直到它的能力开始改变我们。

也求你教导我们如何以有说服力的方式告诉人：我们找到了医治之道。

我们奉耶稣的名祷告。阿们。

---

照着圣经所说，祂为我们的罪死了；祂被埋葬了；又照着圣经所说，第三天复活了；并且向矶法显现，然后向十二使徒显现。此后，祂又同时向五百多位弟兄姊妹显现，其中大多数如今还活着，不过也有些已经睡了。然后祂向雅各显现，再向众使徒显现；最后，也向我显现，像向一个未到产期而生的人一样。因为我在使徒中原是最小的，不配称为使徒，因为我从前逼迫神的教会。然而我今日成了何等人，是蒙神的恩才成的；并且祂所赐给我的恩不是徒然的。

不，我比众使徒格外劳苦；其实不是我，乃是神的恩与我同在。无论是我，是他们，我们就是这样传，你们也就是这样信的。读经到此结束。所以我们要用几个星期来查考一个主题：公共信仰。把你最深的信念、你是谁，在公共场合与别人谈论，这意味着什么？那些人可能并不认同你的信仰；而你又该如何以一种透明、诚实的方式去做？

同时也要尊重别人；要促进和平。这是多元社会中的每一个人都关心、也需要学习怎样去做的事。我们每个星期都在看这个。今天，你来到也许是你必须谈论的、比较显而易见的一件事。

如果我们要讨论这个主题，就必须谈到这一点：基督教的核心信念到底是什么。你不能在公共场合谈论基督教，除非在某个时候你深入到说：那么，它到底是什么？基督徒所相信的核心内容是什么？你要成为基督徒，需要相信什么？

如果你要这样做，整本圣经里没有比这里更好的地方了。当然，圣经里还有别的地方，但这一段有其特殊地位。你看，刚才读给你们听的这段经文里，保罗说：弟兄姊妹们，我要提醒你们我传给你们的福音；你们也领受了；你们也靠着这福音得救；我自己也是领受了，并且传给了你们；这是最重要的；在最末尾，他

他说，所以无论是“更高的他们”，也就是其他使徒，都是这样——这就是我们所传的，也是你们所信的。他给你的不只是一次福音陈述。

他在说：这就是我传给你们的福音。我领受了它。你们相信了它。它拯救了你们。但他也在《哥林多前书》里说话，而学者之间有一种惊人的共识：哥林多前书写成于耶稣基督死后仅仅二十年左右，它或许是我们在新约中所拥有的所有文献里最早的一批。

如果是这样，那么当保罗谈到“这就是我以前所做的”时，他说：还记得我先前来的时候吗？我现在给你们的是我所领受、也传给你们、你们所信并使你们得救的福音摘要——他所说的是在耶稣去世后没过几年就发生的事。所以，如果你想追溯到根基：基督教到底是什么？基督教相信什么？作为基督徒、并拥有属灵生命，你必须相信的、不可再削减的核心是什么？就在这里，就在这一段。

而之所以在公开场合谈论这些时要牢记这一点，是因为如果你是基督徒，就非常重要的是抓住要紧的要紧事。基督徒相信的东西有很多，不同基督教传统所相信的东西也有很多；其中有些可能非常真实、也非常贴近你的心，但你真的不该一味强调、推动并谈论那些许多其他基督徒甚至都不认同的信念。你应该抓住要紧的要紧事，并把要紧事讲清楚。如果你对基督教持怀疑态度，同样也至关重要的是先弄明白基督教究竟是什么。多年来，人们跟我谈他们为何怀疑、他们真的不信；我就问他们：那么，你认为基督教教导什么？

他们告诉我之后，我就尽可能温和地指出：那并不是基督教所教导的。我通常会说类似这样的话：我不知道全世界有任何一间教会会相信那个。当然，我会尽量用友善的语气来说，但因为我会用这个

我一开始用了一个比喻，我意识到，那样说不太温柔，是不是？不，也许我不该那样表达，但问题是：你真的理解你自以为在拒绝的那个基督教吗？大卫·马丁·劳埃德-琼斯，伟大的英国传道人，有一个他常常问人的问题，他认为这是一个诊断性的问题。

这是个很简单的问题。他会说：你认为自己是基督徒吗？对方会说，是或不是。他就说：那么，为什么？如果一个人说：你为什么觉得我是基督徒？我觉得我在努力按照圣经的教导生活。我非常努力地活得像基督。

我非常努力地降服，像他一样。劳埃德-琼斯博士说，如果有人给出这样的回答，他就知道，尽管这非常非常典型，非常典型，但那个人其实并不真正明白福音，不明白核心教导。这就是福音。它是什么？

好，我们就直接往下说。其实这里面有四个部分。福音是关于耶稣的；关于罪与代替的；关于历史与复活的。

也关于那令人惊讶、带来改变的恩典。我们就逐一来看。好，首先，它是关于耶稣的，因为你看，“我当日所领受又传给你们的，乃是最重要的”，他一开始概括福音，就说：“基督……”其实，整段话里其他所有内容，都只是一些从句或短语，用来解释“基督”。它们都指向基督。福音其实就是基督。

福音就是耶稣基督。怎么会这样呢？“福音”这个词，很多人知道它的意思是喜乐的消息。这在希腊文里技术上确实如此。它其实是用来宣告一件会改变历史的事件的。

这个词的意思通常是用来宣布诸如新王的加冕、击败入侵的军队之类的事，像那样的重大消息事件。若这就是核心——若基督教教导的核心是“福音”——那么我们立刻就会面对：是什么使基督教与其他一切……不同。

宗教。你看，所有宗教当然都包含关于其创始人的叙事。所有宗教都会讲故事，会有关于其创始人生平的叙述。但他们的创始人——所有其他宗教的创始人——是老师，不是救主。

正因为他们是老师而不是救主，他们的生平故事就不是那些宗教“核心中的核心”。那些宗教“核心中的核心”，比如伊斯兰教的五功，或佛教通向觉悟的八正道，那些宗教“核心中的核心”总是一套关于你必须做什么的指引。既然创始人是老师，那些宗教“核心中的核心”就是一套关于你必须做什么的指引。但基督教“核心中的核心”是福音。那不是一套关于你必须做什么的指引。

它是对已经成就之事的记述。它其实不是劝告。基督教不是关于你必须做什么的建议。它是消息。是关于他已经做了什么的消息。

事实上，这整段经文里最引人注目的一点之一是：从第三节一直到末尾，这段对福音的描述里，没有任何关于你必须做什么的内容。其实，这里的福音甚至不包含“你必须悔改并信”。当然，你必须悔改并相信福音；若要在你的生命里发挥功效，他在第二节上面也这么说：他说你们领受了，并且靠它站立得住。但你看，从严格意义上说，那是对福音的回应。

它并不是福音本身的一部分。为什么？因为福音是：你能做的、你将要做的、你曾经做过的任何事，都不能成为你在神面前被接纳的基础。一切都归结为耶稣基督所做的。你所做的、你能做的、你将要做的、你做的任何事，都不能成为你在神面前被接纳的基础。

一切都归结为耶稣基督所做的。因此，甚至悔改和相信，从技术意义上说也不是福音的一部分；那是对福音的回应。当然，福音会给你的生命带来巨大的改变。它使你成为世界上促成和好、公义与爱的行动者。它深刻地

改变你的品格。

它改变你身份的根本结构。它改变你内心的路径。它改变你心的运作方式。然而，这些都是福音所带来的结果。你从来找不到圣经的作者。

你也从来找不到使徒或保罗把这些塞进福音里，好像这是福音的一部分。不。从某种意义上说，福音就是耶稣基督，就是耶稣。所以首先，它是关于基督的。

其次，它也关乎罪与代替。好，那么耶稣所做的第一件事是什么……哦，我们被告知关于耶稣的事。这里说，基督为我们的罪死了。为我们的罪而死。

最先提到的是：罪与代替。首先，是罪。我们被告知耶稣来要做什么的第一件事，就是处理罪。我们无知，需要智慧。是的。

我们是受苦的人，我们需要帮助。我们需要扶持。我们需要解脱。是的。但是，我们在这里学到的是，首先，我们是需要拯救的罪人。

也就是说，罪是我们最根本的人类问题。我知道这需要一点解释。你会说，为什么是这样？嗯，首先，罪意味着：如果神创造了你，并且确实有一位创造你的神，并且他每一秒都托住你，使你得以维系在一起——你可能会说是重力。

好吧，那么重力从哪里来？或者说，是那种……是那种你知道的，电子能围绕原子核运行的方式。是什么让这一切维持在一起？你每一秒都被神托住。

如果确实有一位创造你并且托住你的神，他做了这一切，那么你就欠他一切。或者说，你欠他的并不是只在遇到麻烦之类的时候才祷告。你欠的是要为他而活，彻底地为他而活。但罪是圣经的教导。当然，你知道这一点。

我们不为他而活。我们不为神而活。我们不为邻舍而活。我们为自己而活。我们倾向于自私地生活。

我们把世界弄坏了。这就是罪。但是，你看，说他为罪而死，就意味着那是我们最根本的问题。其他一切都由此而来，因为我们与我们的造物主隔绝了。而我们需要……

“隔绝”这个词并不……你知道，它并不常用

非常非常。但我希望你明白这有多么重要。我想我可以用一个简单的例子让你看见。罪意味着我们在个人关系上、在法律意义上，都与造我们的主隔绝。

中间有一道障碍。耶稣来就是要处理这件事。在他能做任何别的事之前，他必须先把这件事解决。所以想象一下：你有一个朋友，你们做朋友已经很久了。

后来发生了变化。起初，你注意到你的朋友使用你送给他的东西，却不表示承认，也没有感恩。接着更糟。你发现你的朋友对你撒谎，违背承诺，然后又对你撒谎。最后，事情变得非常可怕。

你的朋友从你那里侵吞钱款，因为你们可能一起做生意。或者干脆就是偷你的、抢你的。所有这一切曝光之后，你的朋友坐下来对你说：哦，我们还能做朋友吗？因为我真的……我会努力做得更好。我会努力活得更好。

我很抱歉。你会怎么说呢？当然，你会用你自己的话来讲，你会用你自己的措辞。但本质上，你会说：嗯，我们处在一种疏离、隔绝的状态里。

这既是法律层面的，也是个人层面的。因为你会说：听着，我知道你道歉了，我想你是道歉了。当然，如果我们还要重新做朋友，如果这种隔绝的状态要消失，你必须为此懊悔。但仅仅“以后做得更好”是不够的。

我们要怎么处理你对我做过的事？你抢夺了，有一笔债，有一宗罪行，坏事已经发生了。

若我们还要重新做朋友，就必须处理这不公。看到了吗？个人与法律。并且当然，在神那里，这一切会被无限放大，因为你得罪的是一位无限的神。于是你就有了无限的债。

你有了无限的罪行。中间有一道障碍。这就是为什么耶稣不能只是作为一位教师而来。因为教师来会说：这是你如何道歉、如何稍微做得更好。但那并没有解决问题。

它没有解决隔绝的问题，对吗？也没有解决那道障碍。耶稣来就是要处理这道障碍。怎么处理？

代替。这个小小的词“为”对我们来说并不怎么显明

因为我们英语里的“for”（F-O-R）这个词，涵盖的含义范围极其广。你必须坐下来思考、反复琢磨，才能明白某件事是在“以什么方式”为另一件事。这里面有各种各样的类别。幸好，希腊语有更多的介词可供使用。

这里用的介词是“huper”，意思是“代表……、为……的缘故、在……的位置上”。也就是“替代”。这句话是在说，耶稣基督是为我们而死；他是替代者；他是代替我们死的。

他承担了我们应得的。换句话说，耶稣基督取代了我们的位置——我们本该在十字架上被弃绝的位置。而如果我们信他，那么我们就得着他本该在父家筵席上所得的位置：蒙爱、作神的儿女。

哥林多后书5章21节：神使那无罪的，替我们成为罪，好叫我们在他里面成为神的义。现在，圣经用许多不同的隐喻，试图描述十字架上发生了什么。有一种是市场的语言。有时它说，耶稣基督在十字架上付了代价。为什么？

因为罪是一种债。我们刚刚谈过。在古时候，如果你欠了债却还不起，你就会沦为奴隶，直到你能偿还为止。而圣经告诉我们，耶稣基督是我们的赎价。

他把我们从奴役中赎出来。他付了代价，于是我们得以自由。所以你有市场的语言，而罪是一种债。还有另一种语言用来讲十字架。

那是战场的语言。你知道为什么吗？因为罪不只是债，不只是法律意义上的欠债，它还是一股强大的邪恶力量。

它在你我里面。它使我们去做我们厌恶的事。这就是保罗在罗马书第7章里说的：我常常发现自己正在做那件我恨恶的事。它把我们吸进自我中心里，用惧怕和各种东西充满我们，使我们去做我们不愿意做的事。

它是一股里面的力量。当然，它也是外面的力量：人可以伤害我们。而耶稣基督来了。圣经在一些地方说，耶稣上十字架，是为要战胜邪恶、罪与死亡的权势。

这是一场可怕的争战。他受尽痛苦。但到最后，他争战并

他为我们赢得胜利。所以这里有市场的语言，有战场的语言。还有法庭的语言。

法庭的语言说，罪也是对某种标准的违背。而如果确实有一位上帝，你希望他反对邪恶和不公，不是吗？你不希望上帝是被动的。你不希望你的上帝只是袖手旁观。你希望他对这件事有所作为。

你希望他在司法上对邪恶和不公发出忿怒。但如果看看我们里面是否也有任何邪恶、任何罪，那么那忿怒、那司法性的忿怒、那定罪就落在我们身上；可是耶稣基督来了，承担了我们本该受的刑罚。现在，尽管这些比喻彼此差异很大，还有别的，还有别的。但所有这些隐喻都很美妙，因为它们展示了人类问题的不同侧面，也展示了我们所拥有的丰盛救恩的不同而奇妙的方面。但你有没有注意到，有一条线贯穿其中？

每一个。替代。

耶稣争战。耶稣付代价。耶稣承担了我们无法承担的。

这就是为什么约翰·斯托得在他所有著作中最精彩的一段里说到这点。他是一位英国圣公会的牧师。他说，“替代”的概念对于理解罪与救恩都至关重要。你若想明白福音，就必须明白替代。因为一方面，什么是罪？

那就是你用自己来替代上帝，把自己放在只有上帝才配在的位置上。你掌管自己的人生，但你并不是自造的。你看，当你说“我要决定我自己人生的一切”，你在说什么？你在说“我是我自己的制造者。我是我自己的创造者。”

当你行事仿佛你是自己的制造者、自己的创造者，而你其实不是，这有点像宇宙级的剽窃，你知道吗？当你把自己放在那个位置上，而且顺便说一句，你严重不够资格去做你生命的主。严重不够资格。你看，罪就是你用自己来替代上帝。那救恩呢？救恩就是上帝用自己来替代你，把自己放在你本该在的位置上。

上帝走上十字架，承担他自己的刑罚。现在，罪是

代替。保罗一开口说的第一件事，就是在概括那件在基督教运动之初、在开端之开端就改变了人生命运的事；在一切基督教信念之核的核心。而是的，尽管我很喜欢滔滔不绝、还想继续讲下去，我还是得先停一下。因为这件事再重要不过，这对基督教来说再核心不过，但它却正面冲撞我们的文化。所有人都是罪人；耶稣基督必须上十字架，替我们承担刑罚，平息——“挽回”是旧译——上帝的忿怒，使上帝的忿怒得到满足；这种观念在我们的文化里会在无数层面让人皱眉。

因此我想简短地处理几个问题，算是把一些零散的尾巴收一收。第一，我想回应一种反对意见：认为这是个原始、嗜血的观念——耶稣基督上十字架、以自己代替我们。第二，我也想向你说明：这其实是最民主、最平等的一种教义。先说第一点，有人指控说：这种说法认为耶稣基督必须流血，才能满足上帝对罪的刑罚与忿怒。许多人说，这实在难以置信。

这就像古代那些原始、异教而可怕的宗教一样——充斥着鲜血和献祭。J.I.巴刻在他那本伟大的书《认识神》（Knowing God）里，有一章专门讨论这个主题。他举了一个绝佳的例子，说明当人们想到原始、异教、嗜血的宗教时，心里指的是什么。

他谈到《伊利亚特》，荷马的《伊利亚特》。在《伊利亚特》中，有些人可能知道，大概从六年级就学过。希腊军队乘船要去特洛伊——记得因为王子帕里斯把海伦带走了。希腊军的统帅，也就是阿伽门农，发现他们无法启航。哦，为什么呢？

因为逆风。因为诸神不知为何对他们发怒了。于是阿伽门农派人把自己的女儿叫来，举行仪式把她宰杀，作为祭物，来安抚那些敌对的神明。旧词叫“挽回”（propitiation）。他挽回了诸神的忿怒，然后他们就能驶向特洛伊。

顺便说一句，如果你在

六年级的时候，他们大概把那一段给省略了。我真正开始读的时候，他们也把那部分对我省略了。我说，你们为什么不告诉我最精彩的内容呢？你知道的。嗯，人们会说，好了，看吧。哎呀。

这里有一个父亲为了讨好诸神、平息他们的愤怒，竟把自己的女儿、自己的孩子献祭了。这太可怕了。然后人们说，基督教也就是这样。它跟那一样原始、嗜血。还有，J.R.

帕克说，不，不。不但不是那样，而且完全不同。为什么？他是这么说的。他说，在异教里，人去安抚他的神。

于是宗教就变成了一种商业行为，甚至是一种贿赂。然而在基督教里，上帝借着他自己出于爱的献祭行动，平息他自己的忿怒。你看，上帝在耶稣基督里来到世上，他去承担、承受他自己的惩罚，这完全不同。它恰恰是古代那种原始、嗜血宗教的反面。别那么说。

其次，我想反过来再谈谈这种“代替性”教义。它在根本上是平等的、民主的。你可能会想，哇，这有点奇怪。我希望你看看这里，在福音陈述一开始保罗说的那个小词：基督为我们的罪死了。你知道这有多有意思吗？

这里面有一个世界的含义。保罗并没有说“为你们的罪”。保罗是“希伯来人中的希伯来人”。保罗告诉我们，他是一个多么谨慎、敬虔的宗教人士。他仔细研读圣经，想找出圣经说我们该做的每一件事。

他竭尽所能遵守上帝律法的每一个细节，凡他能做到的都去做。然而他在这里却说什么？耶稣基督代替了我们，为我们的罪而死——意思是我也该死。我的记录也配得死亡。

如果这在你看来完全无法理解，你就需要去读《罗马书》一、二、三章；在那里，他给出了一个非常高层次的总结。他用一章来谈论异教徒。是的，外邦人，那些不相信圣经的人，他们也不遵守圣经关于贞洁与纯洁的规则，并且……

正直、以及诸如此类。但随后他转向那些相信圣经的人。他指出，尽管从外表看他们在遵守圣经，内里他们的动机却不是出于对上帝的爱，而是出于对自我的爱。

在他们的自义里面，有骄傲。他来到第三章，说：所以，众人都犯了罪，亏缺了上帝的荣耀。他又说：没有义人，连一个也没有。没有人真正寻求上帝。这是多么惊人的宣告。

因为保罗在这里所说的是：那些我一生被教导要鄙视的人——外邦人——那些我甚至不愿与之同席吃饭的人，因为他们是不洁的；他们不遵守圣经。那些我一直鄙视的人，如今我却把我的一生都花在他们当中。我把我的一生都花在他们身上。

为什么？因为我们其实并没有什么不同。他说：我并不比一个割人喉咙、抢人钱财的罪犯更好。归根结底，当然，我们迷失的方式不同；归根结底，我们以不同的方式违背上帝的律法。

归根结底，我们都以不同的方式，未能尽心、尽性、尽力爱上帝，并且爱邻舍如同自己。因此，我们都是同样的罪人。我们同样迷失，同样需要上帝的恩典。这是最彻底平等、最使人得人性的教义。看看保罗。

是什么把他从一个自义的种族主义者变成一个拥抱所有人、把他们当作平等之人的人呢？该说是什么？是福音。福音使他恢复人性。因为其他所有宗教和哲学都说：这是你必须做的，才能得救；这是你必须做的，才能找到上帝。

这是你必须做的，才能拯救世界；这是你必须做的，才能成为一个好人或一个有道德的人。在那种情况下，总会有一群人站在这边，没有去做你认为应该做的事。因此你就不得不说：哦，你看，他们没有做这个。但保罗说：这不重要。

自由派、保守派；道德的、不道德的；你知道，前卫的、体面的；这个种族、那个种族，都无所谓。我们都是罪人。我们都需要恩典。这是多么深刻地使人得人性。

多么

也就是一种彻底的平等主义。你知道为什么吗？因为我们所有人都是这个世界问题的一部分。你没法在——我想我所知道的每一种其他哲学里、每一个我所知道的其他政治纲领里——找到这一点。

我所知道的每一种其他宗教，基本上都在说：我们知道我们应该做什么；而那边那些人才是世界的问题所在。当然，保罗说，不，不，不，不。我们所有人都是问题。你知道，阿加莎·克里斯蒂的小说《东方快车谋杀案》。

里面的侦探波洛被困在一列火车上，火车卡在雪堆里。然后有一个人被谋杀了。他试图弄清楚凶手是谁。而他在火车上同车的还有另外12位乘客。

那么这12个人里，到底是谁杀了人？所以他在设法找出来。而这是他见过最棘手的一案。因为所有线索都指向不同的方向。他意识到自己漏掉了什么。

他漏掉了什么。到底是什么关键洞见能把一切串起来？是什么关键洞见能让一切都说得通？嗯，令人意外的答案——我就告诉你了。要是有人抱怨我剧透，我想让你知道：这本书已经出版80年了。

如果你还没读过、也没看过改编作品，那我可不想听你抱怨。你知道那个关键洞见是什么吗？是所有人都干了。12个人一起把那个人杀了。于是突然之间，一切都说得通了。

他们全都是反派。他们全都是凶手。他们全都有份。好吧，这就是福音给你的线索；没有这个线索，你的人生就不会有意义。

社会不会有意义，历史也不会有意义。我们都在其中。我们都在其中。没有人是义的。

一个也没有。最民主、最平等主义的教义。好，现在第三点。这个福音陈述的第三部分是最长的，但这并不表示它一定比其他部分更重要。从某种意义上说，它之所以长，大概是因为它在铺垫：本章后面的内容将会对复活的教义作一段冗长而美妙、非凡的论述；因为这在哥林多教会是个争议。但重点是，他现在说第三部分是关于

福音是历史，是复活。他说，基督照着圣经所说，为我们的罪死了；也埋葬了。

又照着圣经所说，第三天复活了；并且显给矶法看（就是彼得），然后显给十二使徒看；此后又同时显给五百多位弟兄姊妹看，其中大多数到如今还在；以后显给雅各看，再显给众使徒看；末了也显给我看——他几乎是在说，好像主还得特地回来跑这一趟，因为我仿佛生不逢时似的。但他也向我显现了。现在他在讲什么？复活。

为什么耶稣基督的复活在福音中如此重要？因为复活至关重要——它既关乎我们过去的救恩，也关乎我们将来的救恩。首先，它确据并保证了我们过去的救恩。你怎么知道耶稣在十字架上死，真的付清了罪债？你怎么知道它确实战胜了罪？

你怎么知道刑罚已经被担当？你怎么知道一切都已经付清？以致你若信他，就不再被定罪。你怎么知道？你看，在那些年代，如果一个人欠债，他要么沦为奴隶，要么可能被关进监牢。

你能知道债已经还清的唯一方式——你能确信债已还清的方式——就是当那个人被释放、被放出来的时候。那时你就知道债已经还清了。罪的工价乃是死。而当耶稣基督从死亡中被释放，挣断死亡的捆绑时，这就是债已付清的证据。

这就是债已付清的证据。你在商店里购物，手里提着一个袋子，里面装着你已经买好的东西；没有什么比几个便衣走过来对你说“你真的买了这些吗？让我看看你的袋子里面”更倒霉、更令人不快的了。你很恼火，感觉很糟，但你会怎么做？你会伸手进去拿出什么？

收据。你就说：“别再烦我了。”你说：“走开。”为什么？因为这是证明你的

那项指控毫无根据。你若是基督徒，知道怎样用“复活”来做到这一点吗？

你学会这样做了吗？当你的良心来追讨你——你失败了，你做了一件非常、非常糟糕的事——这事折磨得你快要崩溃。你是基督徒吗？你信了耶稣基督吗？你的良心在控告你、折磨你。

你知道怎样凭着复活脱困，并对你的良心说：“不要再搅扰我。走开。这就是我的收据。这证明那债已经完全付清。这证明在历史上盖上了‘已付清’的印章，以至于没有人会错过它、忽视它。”

你知道怎样这样做吗？所以，一方面，复活使你确信并稳固——你过去的救恩；但另一方面，它也使你确信并稳固未来的救恩，因为我们的未来救恩不只是被赦免，然后作为灵魂去天堂生活。我们的未来是：复活的身体、新天新地、一个没有痛苦与死亡的地方。你知道那将会是什么样子吗？

托尔金在一篇题为《论童话故事》（On Fairy-Stories）的文章里，试图帮助我们理解：为什么我们如此喜爱童话、科幻，或者我们所说的奇幻故事。我们不断阅读它们，观看它们，年复一年把它们拍成卖座大片。那里有魔法，有幻想。

他在试图理解：为什么在这个世界上——尤其是在我们这个现代时代，当我们非常世俗、非常科学，也明知这些故事是虚构的——我们仍然涌进电影院，仍然读那些书，而且还会被深深触动。他说：原因在这里，因为这些故事向我们展示了一些东西；它们描绘出我们所渴望、而且无法停止渴望的事物。以下是其中一些。

他说，我们渴望有能力走出时间之外。能够走出时间之外的想法令我们着迷。第二，我们渴望逃脱死亡。第三，我们渴望不必分离的爱——不会终止的爱。

这还不止于“不必分离的爱”。第四，我们渴望……我们对与非人类存在沟通的想法着迷。最后，他说，我们实际上，当然，渴望有一个

邪恶最终被打败。所以每当我们看到这类故事，它们就会把我们牢牢抓住。

我们永远看不够，因为它正好挠到我们痒处。我们对这些东西有一种不可思议的渴望。但你知道吗？如果耶稣基督的复活真的发生过，并且你信靠祂，那么所有那些事情其实都会在字面意义上成真——真的会成真。你看，如果你对基督教持怀疑态度，好吧，你可以怀疑，但你为什么会不希望这是真的呢？

如果你不希望这是真的，你就是对自己不诚实。而基督教应许这一点——不只是应许；它在本质上把这一点展示出来；它借着复活在本质上证明了这一点。

这就是他为什么要讲这些。为什么他还要继续往下说？他被矶法（Cephas）看见；他被十二使徒看见；他被五百人看见，其中大多数人现在仍然活着。

理查德·鲍克汉（Richard Bauckham）在他那本很棒的书《耶稣与目击者》（Jesus and the Eyewitnesses）里指出：这些其实就是脚注。你看，如果你今天在写一部严肃的学术著作，尤其是历史著作，你必须有脚注。为什么？因为你的脚注基本上是在说：你可以用这些方式来核实我所说的是真的。比如说，如果你写：在某年某月某地，这件事发生了。

那么你就会在脚注里标明：在某个图书馆的某个历史档案登记处里，有原始信件之类的东西。他说，脚注就是一种方式，让你对读者说：我所说的是真的；而脚注所指向的来源，使你可以查证我告诉你的是真实的。但你看，在那个年代，如果你写的不是传说，而是历史，你怎么做“脚注”呢？你会说：这里有仍然活着的见证人，他们亲眼看见了这件事，你可以去核查——这就是脚注。

这些就是来源。保罗是在说：有成百上千的人亲眼看见了耶稣。你去跟他们谈。大多数人仍然活着。到这个时候不过才二十年。

你明白这意味着什么吗？保罗是在说：复活不是一个象征。它不是一个温馨的故事。它不是一个传说。它不是在漫长岁月中一路流传到我们这里的虚构。

人们看见了

他。有证据在那儿。如果真是这样，那么你在生命中最渴望的东西、你最渴望的那种世界，是可以得到的。它就在那里。相信福音。

你看，在最最末尾。这个结尾严格来说是一段见证，非常精彩。因为你知道，福音归根到底是个人性的。它不只是几条要点式的子弹清单。他说：“我原是使徒中最小的，不配称为使徒，因为我从前逼迫　神的教会。

然而，我今日成了何等人，是蒙　神的恩才成的；并且他所赐我的恩不是徒然的。不，我比众使徒格外劳苦；这原不是我，乃是　神的恩与我同在。”你看这三件事，正如我们刚才所说。

首先，这是关于恩典的福音。注意，他三次使用这个词。福音是关于恩典、恩典、恩典。之所以马丁·劳埃德-琼斯（Lloyd-Jones）可以用那个诊断性问题去问人：“你是基督徒吗？”如果他们回答：“嗯，我在努力、很努力地尝试。”他之所以立刻知道他们没有明白基督信仰的核心，是因为他们不明白“恩典”。

他们基本上是在说：“嗯，如果我足够努力，那么也许　神就会赐福我。”天哪。你知道吗？约翰·班扬（John Bunyan）——写了《天路历程》的人——在他的自传《恩典丰溢：致罪魁》（Grace Abounding to the Truth, to the chief of sinners）里，讲了一个他大概是如何归信的故事。他一直在读圣经，可那只让他更有罪疚感。但他说，有一天，他突然想到一件事。

他在书里说，有一天，当我穿过一片田地时，忽然我想到一句话，一句话：“你的义在天上。”他解释说，后来他就凭着信心的眼睛，把他在圣经里读到的东西串联起来。他说：“凭着信心的眼睛，我看见基督坐在　神的右边；我忽然明白——那就是我的义。　神不可能问：‘你今天的义在哪里？’因为它一直就在他面前。我的良好心境不能使我的义变得更好；我的糟糕心境也不能使我的义变得更坏。

我的义就是耶稣基督——昨日、今日、直到永远都是一样。于是，我的锁链真的就脱落了。我

我感到自己从罪疚和恐惧的奴役中被拯救出来。我看见，我心里那些软弱的性格特质，就像一个富人揣在口袋里的几枚便士，而他的财富目标却安稳地锁在家里的箱子里。要恩典，得恩典，直到“恩典的便士”在你心里啪地一声落下、你真正恍然大悟；否则你还没有抓住福音。其次，然而，恩典并不意味着：好吧，你就是被接纳了。

事情并非只有这样，它并不会改变你——当然会改变你，因为他怎么说？“他赐给我的恩典不是徒然的。”哎呀，这简直是年度最轻描淡写的一句话。因为他的意思是：我曾经恨基督教；他没说出来的是：而且我是个极其出色的人。要知道，保罗是世界历史上最有影响力的人物之一。

他才华横溢，却憎恨基督教，然而恩典改变了他。那么恩典怎样改变你呢？因为恩典是不配得的——一旦你意识到神的恩典是你不配得的，它就使你谦卑。但当你也意识到恩典是无条件的：正因为它是不配得的，它把你压低——我并不比任何人更好；但也正因为它是无条件的，它又把你扶起来。

我总是被接纳，我总是被爱——平安、胆量；并且因为它是有代价的，所以对你而言它完全是免费的：神的恩典。但对他而言却是无限昂贵的，因为他在十字架上必须经历那些。它把你变成一个愿意为他人舍己的爱人。“不是徒然的”，不是徒然的。最后，它让你满心惊奇。

你看，他几乎是在……我觉得他对自己都感到惊讶。他就看着自己说：“然而我今日成了何等人，是蒙神的恩才成的。”当你说这句话、当你——你知道，凯西这周提醒我，《纽约时报》周二的科学版谈到一个事实：我们大概正处在找到丙型肝炎（hep C）治愈方法的边缘。这种病顺便说一句，夺走的人比艾滋病还多。它在杀死你的同时，还让你过着极其痛苦的生活。而现在看起来也许——他们特意强调并不确定——但看起来不仅可能有疫苗，甚至可能有一种药片，就是一片药，不是疫苗，
你服下去，就能在几天之内把它从你体内清除掉。

几个月。

当然，所有听到这消息的人都会兴奋不已；他们震惊、惊叹、赞美，彼此转告，奔走相告。你当然也会这样。你当然会这样想：想想那份喜乐——原本悬在你头上的死刑判决被撤销了。你难道不会把这事告诉所有人吗？你难道不会惊叹吗？

但你听着，福音远不止如此。我们说的不只是把你的寿命延长几年。我们说的是爱而不别离，是从死亡中得逃脱，是与非人类的存在相通。我们说的是你曾经渴望的一切。你怎么可能不满心喜乐？

你怎么可能不想告诉人：这是借着祷告？

我们在天上的父，我们感谢你赐下福音。我们感谢你福音那喜乐的好消息。我们求你使它那“不配得”的性质、那无条件的性质、那付上代价的性质，像它改变保罗一样改变我们——使我们谦卑，使我们得能力，融化我们，使我们柔软，使我们更有人性。

哦，父啊，赦免我们没有行事为人配得过福音；这意味着我们只是没有在想——没有在想，直到它的能力开始改变我们。

也求你教导我们，如何以恳切、吸引人的方式告诉人：我们找到了医治的良方。我们奉耶稣的名祷告。阿们。
