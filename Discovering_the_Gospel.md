## English Transcript / 英文原文

the Scriptures,  that He was buried,  that He was raised on the third day  according to the Scriptures,  and that He appeared to seephus,  and then to the 12. After that, He appeared to more than 500  of the brothers and sisters at the same time,  most of whom are still living,  though some have fallen asleep. Then He appeared to James,  then to all the apostles,  and last of all, He appeared to me also  as to one abnormally born. For I am the least of the apostles  and do not even deserve to be called an apostle,  because I persecuted the Church of God. But by the grace of God,  I am what I am,  and His grace to me was not without effect.

No, I worked harder than all of them,  yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me. Whether then it is I or they,  this is what we preach,  and this is what you believed. Here ends the reading. So we're looking at,  for a number of weeks,  we're looking at the subject of public faith. What does it mean to talk about  your deepest beliefs,  who you are,  with others in public,  who may not share your beliefs,  and how do you do that in a way  that's transparent, that's honest.

The same time is respectful. It promotes peace. This is something that everyone in the plural  is excited and needs to learn how to do. And we've been looking at this each week. And today you come to maybe perhaps  one of the more obvious things that you have to talk about.

We need to talk about  if we're going to discuss this subject. And that is what actually  are the core beliefs of Christianity. You can't talk in public about Christianity,  unless at some point you get down to say,  well, what is it? What are the core things that Christians believe? What do you believe in order to be a Christian?

And if you're going to do that,  there's no better spot in the whole Bible than here. Sure, there's other places in the Bible,  but this has a special place  because look,  at the passage it was just read to you. Paul says,  now brothers and sisters,  I want to remind you of the gospel. I preach to you that you received  by this you were saved,  and I had received it,  and I passed it on to you,  and it's a first importance of the very end,  he says,  so whether it's higher they,  meaning the others that are apostles,  this is what we preach,  and this is what you believed. What he is giving you is not only a gospel presentation.

He says,  here's the gospel I preached to you. I received it. You believed it. It saved you. But he's also speaking in the book of 1 Corinthians,  and there's an amazing amount of consensus  that 1 Corinthians was written just 20 years after  the death of Jesus Christ,  that it was perhaps the oldest  of all the peeps of literature we have in the New Testament.

And if that's the case,  then when Paul talks about this is what I did before,  he says,  remember when I came before,  I'm giving you a summary of the gospel  that I received,  that I gave you,  that you believed,  that saved you,  he's talking about something that happened just a handful of years  after Jesus' death. So if you want to get down to the foundations,  what is Christianity all about? What is Christianity believed? What is the irreducible core  that you must believe to be a Christian  and to have spiritual life? Here it is, right here.

And the reason why it's so important to keep in mind  if you're doing public talking about this in public  is if you're a Christian,  it is so important to major in the majors. There's lots and lots of things that Christians believe  and there's lots of things that different branches of Christian  Christianity believe,  and some of them may be very true,  very dear to your heart,  but you really should not press and push and talk  about beliefs that a lot of other Christians don't even share. You ought to major in the majors and hear the majors. And if you're skeptical of Christianity,  it's also crucial to get straight what Christianity really is. Over the years when people talk to me about how they're skeptical,  they really don't believe,  and I ask them,  well, what do you think Christianity teaches?

They tell me,  and as gently as possible,  I have to point out that that's not what Christianity teaches. I usually say something like,  I don't know a single church in the whole world that believes that. And of course,  I try to say it a nice tone,  but since I use this illustration in the beginning  and I realize,  that's not very gentle is it? No, maybe I shouldn't put it that way,  but the deal is,  do you really understand the Christianity you think you're rejecting? David Martin Lloyd-Jones,  great British preacher,  had a question that he used to ask people,  that he considered a diagnostic question.

It's a simple question,  and he would say,  do you consider yourself a Christian? And the person would say,  yes or no, he said,  well, why? And if a person says,  why do you think I'm a Christian? I think I'm trying hard to live according to the teachings of the Bible. I'm trying very hard to live like Christ.

I'm trying very hard to surrender and be like him. And Dr. Lloyd-Jones says,  if somebody gives an answer like that,  he knows that even though that's very, very typical,  very typical,  that that person doesn't really understand the gospel,  doesn't understand the core teachings. This is the gospel. What is it?

Well, let's just move right through it. There's actually four parts to this. The gospel is about Jesus. It's about sin and substitution. It's about history and resurrection.

And it's about astonishing, transforming grace. Just right through it. Okay, so first of all,  it's about Jesus,  because see, for what I received,  I passed on to you as a first importance,  and as soon as he begins,  his summary of the gospel, he says,  that Christ,  and actually, everything else,  in the whole paragraph,  is just a set of clauses or phrases that explain Christ. They all point back to Christ. The gospel is Christ, actually.

The gospel is Jesus Christ. Now, how would that be? Well, the word gospel,  though many people understand the word gospel means joyful news. That's what the Greek word technically means. It was actually used to announce a history-changing event.

It was the word that meant,  it was usually used to announce something like  the carnation of a new king,  the defeat of an invading army,  something like that,  some major news event. And if that's the core,  if the core of Christian teaching is a gospel,  then right away we're confronted with  what makes Christianity different from all of the religions. See, all of the religions contain  narratives about their founders, of course. All of the religions tell stories and have narratives  about the lives of their founders. But their founders, all the other religions,  their founders are teachers not saviors.

And because their teachers not saviors,  their life story is not the core of the core of those religions. The core of the core of those religions,  like the five pillars of Islam  or the eightfold path to enlightenment of Buddhism,  the core of the core of those religions  is always a set of directions about what you must do. Since the founders are teachers,  the core of the core of those religions  is a set of directions about what you must do. But the core of the core of Christianity is a gospel. That's not a set of directions about what you must do.

It's an account of what has been done. It's not actually advice. Christianity is not advice about what you must do. It's news. It's news about what he has done.

And in fact, one of the most striking things about this whole passage  is from verse three all the way to the end,  this description of the gospel,  there's nothing in here about what you must do. In fact, the gospel in here doesn't even contain  that you must repent and believe. Now, of course, you must repent and believe the gospel. If it's to be operative in your life,  and he says so up in verse two,  he says which you received,  and you took your stand on it. But see, technically,  that's a response to the gospel.

It's not actually part of the gospel. Why? Because the gospel is that nothing you can do,  nothing you will do,  nothing you have ever done can be the basis  for your acceptance with God. It all happens to what Jesus Christ has done. There's nothing you have done,  nothing you can do, nothing you will do,  nothing you do can be the basis for your acceptance with God.

It all comes to what Jesus Christ has done. So even repenting and believing is an actually part  of the gospel, technically,  it's a response to the gospel. And of course, the gospel brings massive changes to your life. It makes you an agent of reconciliation,  injustice, and love in the world. It profoundly changes your character.

It changes the very structure of your identity. It changes the very pathways of your heart. It changes the way your heart works. And yet, those are results of the gospel. You never find the authors of the scripture.

You never find the apostles or Paul ever loading that  into the gospel as if that's part of it. No. In a sense, the gospel is Jesus Christ. It is Jesus. So first of all, it's about Christ.

Secondly, though, it's about sin and substitution. Okay, so what's the first thing Jesus... Oh, we're told about Jesus. It says that Christ died for our sins. Die for our sins.

The very first thing, sin and substitution. First of all, sin. The first thing that we're told about what Jesus came to do  is deal with sin. We are uninformed and we need wisdom. Yes.

We are sufferers and we need help. We need support. We need relief. Yes. But, what we're learning here is,  first of all, we're sinners needing salvation.

That is to say, sin is our most fundamental human problem. And I got that takes a little bit of explanation. He said, why is that? Well, first of all, sin means that if God created you,  and if there is a God who created you  and who sustains you every single second,  and keeps you actually together from... You may say it's gravity.

Well, okay, where's that from? Or it's the way... It's the way, you know, the electrons stay in orbit  around the nucleus. What's keeping that together? You are being held together every second by God.

If there is a God who created you and sustains you  and who does all that,  then you owe him everything. Or, you owe it not to him just to pray  when you're in trouble or something like that. You owe it to live for him, to live for him totally. But sin is the teaching of the Bible. That, of course, you know this.

We don't live for him. We don't live for God. We don't live for our neighbor. We live for ourselves. We tend to live selfishly.

We've ruined the world. That's sin. But, well, see, to say he died for sin  means that that's our fundamental problem. Everything else comes from that because we're alienated from our maker. And we need...

The word alienation doesn't... You know, it's not used very much. But I want you to see how important it is. And I think I can do that by just giving you a simple illustration. Sin means we're personally and legally alienated from our maker.

There's a barrier there. And Jesus came to do something about it. And before he can do anything else,  he has to do that. So imagine you have a friend. You've been friends for a good long time.

Something changes. First, you notice your friend uses things that you give your friend  without acknowledgement, without gratitude. Then it gets worse. You find your friend lying to you, breaking promises,  and then lying to you. And finally, it gets terrible.

Your friend embezzles money from you because you're maybe in business together. We're just steals from you and robs from you. And after all this comes out, your friend sits down and says,  oh, can we stay friends because I really... I'll try to do better. I'll try to live better.

And I'm very sorry. And what are you going to say? Now, you'll use your own words. And you'll use your own words. But essentially, you're going to say,  hmm, we are in a state of alienation.

It's both legal and personal. Because what you're going to say is,  look, I know you're sorry. I guess you're sorry. And of course, if we're ever going to be friends again,  if this state of alienation is going to go away,  you will have to be sorry. But it won't be enough just to do better.

What are we going to do about what you did to me? You've robbed. There's a debt. There's a crime. Bad things have happened.

There's an injustice that has to be dealt with  if we are ever going to be friends again. See? Personal and legal. And of course, with God,  it would be writ infinitely larger  because you have an infinite God. Then you have an infinite debt.

You have an infinite crime. And there's a barrier. And that's the reason why Jesus could not come as a teacher. Because teachers come and say,  here's how you can be sorry and do a little better. That doesn't deal with the problem.

Doesn't deal with the alienation. Does it? Doesn't deal with the barrier. And Jesus came to deal with the barrier. How?

Substitution. This little word four is not very revealing to us  because our English word four, F-O-R,  covers such an enormous range of meanings. You have to have to sit and think and reflect before you know  in what way something is for something else. There's all sorts of categories. Fortunately, Greek had more prepositions that serviced.

And the preposition used here is who pair which means  on behalf of in the place of. As a substitute. This is saying that Jesus Christ died on behalf of us. He was a substitute. He died instead of us.

He took what we deserve. In other words, Jesus Christ took our place. The place we deserve to be cast out on the cross. And if we believe in Him,  then we get the place that He deserved at the table in the family. Love, child of God.

Second Corinthians 5, 21, God made Him sin, who knew no sin,  that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. Now, there's a lot of different metaphors  that the Bible uses to try to describe what happened on the cross. There's the language of the marketplace. Sometimes it talks about that Jesus Christ on the cross paid a price. Why?

Because sin is a debt. We just talked about that. And in the olden days, if you had a debt, you couldn't pay. You went into slavery until you could pay it. And Jesus Christ, we're told in the Bible, is our ransom.

He redeems us out of slavery. He pays the price. And so we're liberated. So you have the language of the marketplace and sin is a debt. Another kind of language is used to deal with the cross.

It's the language of the battlefield. You know why? Because sin is not just a debt. It's not just a legal debt. It's a powerful evil force.

It's in you and me. It makes us do things we hate. That's the reason why Paul, you know, in Romans 7 says,  very often I find I'm doing the very thing I hate. It absorbs us with ourselves and fills us with fears  and fills us with all sorts of things. And we do things we don't like to do.

It's a force inside. Of course, it's a force outside. People can wrong us. And Jesus Christ comes. And the Bible, some places talks about Jesus going to the cross  to defeat the powers of evil and sin and death.

And it's a terrible struggle. And he suffers horribly. But in the end, he fights and he wins for us. So there's the language of the marketplace, the language of the battlefield. There's also the language of the law court.

The language of the law court says that sin is also a violation of a standard. And if there is a God, you want him to be against evil and injustice, don't you? You don't want God to be passive. You don't want your God just to look on. You want him to do something about it.

You want him to be judicially wrathful against evil and injustice. But then to see if we have any evil in sin in us,  then that wrath, that judicial wrath, that condemnation lies on us,  but Jesus Christ comes and takes the punishment that we deserve. Now, as different as that is, there's others, there's others. But all those metaphors are wonderful because they show different aspects of the human problem  and they show different wonderful aspects of the rich salvation we have. But do you notice there's a thread running through all of them?

Every single one of them. Substitution. Jesus fights. Jesus pays. Jesus bears what we couldn't bear.

And that's the reason why John's thought in one of the best passages in all of his writings. He was an Anglican minister, British Anglican minister. He says that the concept of substitution is crucial to understand both sin and salvation. If you want to understand the gospel, you've got to understand substitution. Because on the one hand, what is sin?

It's you substituting yourself for God, putting yourself for only God deserves to be. In charge of your own life, you didn't make yourself. But see, when you say, I'm going to call the shots of my own life, what are you saying? I'm my own maker. I'm my own creator.

When you act as if you're your own maker and your creator and your own creator,  and you're not, it's kind of cosmic plagiarism, you know? And when you put yourself in that place and you're woefully under, by the way,  you're woefully under qualified for the job of being Lord of your life. Woefully under. See, sin is you substituting yourself for God. Well, salvation is God substituting himself for you, putting himself where you deserve to be.

God going to the cross and taking his own punishment. Now, sin is substitution. Very first thing out of Paul's mouth, when he's summarizing the thing that changed people's lives  at the beginning of the beginning of the Christian movement, at the core of the core of all Christian beliefs. And yeah, even though I love to run on and I want to go on,  I need to stop for a little bit because this, as important as this is,  as core as this is to Christianity, it flies right in the face of our culture. The idea that all people are sinners, that Jesus Christ had to go to the cross,  take our punishment, a swage, propitiate is the old word, the wrath of God,  satisfy the wrath of God, that just wrinkles at a hundred levels in our culture.

But I would like to just briefly, therefore, deal with a couple of issues, kind of loose ends. One is I would like to respond to the objection that this is a primitive bloodthirsty idea,  this idea of Jesus Christ going to the cross, substituting himself. And I'd also like to show you that this is the most democratic egalitarian, possible doctrine. So first of all, one of the charges is this whole idea that Jesus Christ goes  and He has to shed His blood in order to satisfy the punishment and wrath of God. Many people say, that's just incredible.

It's just like the ancient primitive pagan terrible religions. They're all bloody with all that sacrifice stuff. J.I. Packer in his great book, Knowing God, has a chapter in which he deals with this subject. And he brings out a perfect example of what people mean when they think about primitive pagan bloodthirsty religion.

He talks about the Iliad, Homer's Iliad. And in the Iliad, some of you know, probably from sixth grade, you know. The Greek army has taken ship to go to Troy. Remember because Prince Paris has taken Helen away. And the general of the Greek army, which was Agamemnon,  finds that they can't say, oh, why?

Because of contrary wins. Because the gods for some reason are angry at them. So Agamemnon sends for his daughter and ceremonially slaughters her as a sacrifice,  malifies the hostile gods. The old word was propitiation. He propities the wrath of the gods and then they can sail to Troy.

That was the, by the way, if you learn this in sixth grade, they probably left that part out. They left it out for me when I actually started reading. I said, why didn't they tell me the best stuff, you know. Well, people say, there we go. Oh, my word.

Here's a father who sacrifices his daughter, his child,  to malify the gods, to propitiate their wrath. This is terrible. And Christianity is just like that. It's primitive and bloodthirsty just like that. And J.R.

Packer says, no, no. Not only is it not like that, it's utterly different. Why? And here's what he says. He says, in paganism, man propituates his gods.

And religion becomes a form of commercialism and indeed of bribery. In Christianity, however, God propities his own wrath  through his own sacrificial action of love. See, as God comes in Jesus Christ and goes  and he takes his own punishment, it's utterly different. It's the reverse of ancient primitive bloodthirsty religion. Don't say that.

Now, secondly, I'd like to say something on the contrary about this doctrine of substitutionism. It's radically egalitarian and democratic. And if you think, you say, boy, that's kind of weird. I want you to look at the little word in here right in the beginning of the gospel presentation,  where Paul says Christ died for our sins. You know what's so interesting about that?

There's a world of meaning in that. Paul did not say for your sins. Paul was a Hebrew of the Hebrews. Paul tells us about what an incredibly fastidious, godly religious person he was. He poured over the Bible and he tried to find anything the Bible says that we should do.

And he did everything he possibly could in order to comply with every single aspect of God's law. And did everything he could. And yet here he is saying what? That Jesus Christ substituted himself and died for our sins, meaning I deserve to die too. My record deserves death.

Now, if that seems absolutely inexplicable to you, you need to read the book of Romans chapters one, two, and three,  where he, in a very top level summary of that. He spends one chapter talking about the pagans. Yes, the Gentiles, the people who didn't believe the Bible,  and they don't follow the biblical rules of chastity and purity and integrity and so on. But then he turns to people who believe the Bible. And he shows that though externally, they're obeying the Bible inside their motivation is not for love of God, but for love of self.

Inside their self-righteousness, there's pride. And he gets to chapter three, and he says, therefore, all have sinned and falls short of the glory of God. And he says, no one is righteous, no not one. No one is really even seeking for God. It's an amazing statement.

Because here's what Paul is saying. Paul is saying, the people that all of my life I was taught to despise, the Gentiles, the people that I wouldn't even want to eat with,  because they're unclean. They don't follow the Bible. The people that I've always despised, now I'm spending my whole life with. I'm spending my whole life with them.

Why? Because we're not really any different. He says, I'm really no better than a criminal that slits people's throats and takes their money. In the end, though, of course, we're lost in different ways. In the end, though, we violate the law of God in different ways.

In the end, we all fail to love God without our hard soul strength and our neighbors ourselves in different ways. And therefore, we're all equally sinners. We're all equally lost and we're all equally in need of God's grace. That is the most radically egalitarian humanizing doctrine there is. Look at Paul.

What turned him from a self-righteous racist into a person who embraces all people as his equals ought to say what? It was the gospel. It humanized him. Because every other religion and philosophy says this is what you must do to get saved. This is what you must do to find God.

This is what you must do to save the world. This is what you must do in order to be a good person or a moral person. In which case, there's always a bunch of people over here not doing what you think should be done. And therefore, you have to say, oh, look, they're not doing this. But see, Paul says it doesn't matter.

Liberal conservative, moral immoral, you know, avant-garde, respectable. This race, that race, it doesn't matter. We're all sinners. We're all in need of grace. How radically humanizing that is.

How radically egalitarian that is. You know why? Because we're all the problem with this world. You can't look in every, I think every other philosophy I know. Every other political platform I know.

Every other religion I know basically says we know what we should be doing. And these people over here are the problem with the world. And of course, Paul says, no, no, no, no. We're all the problem. You know, Agatha Christie's novel, Murder on the Orient Express.

It's her detective, Paul Rowe. It's stuck on a train, stuck in a snow drift. And a man is murdered. And he's trying to figure out who was the murderer. And he's on the train with 12 other passengers.

So which of the 12 has done the murder? So he's trying to figure it out. And this is the hardest one he's ever seen. Because all the clues are pointing in different ways. And he realizes he's missing something.

He's missing something. What is the key insight that will make sense of everything? What is the key insight that will make sense of everything? Well, the surprise answer, and I'm going to tell you. And if anybody complains about spoilers, I want you to know that this book has been out for 80 years.

And if you haven't read it or seen it, I don't want to hear it. You know what the key insight is? Everybody done it. All 12 people murdered the man together. And suddenly everything makes sense.

They're all the villains. They're all the murders. They're all in it. Okay. This is the clue the Gospel gives you,  without which your life won't make sense.

Society won't make sense. And history won't make sense. We're all in it. We're all in it. No one is right.

Just no not one. Most democratic, egalitarian doctrine. Okay, now thirdly. The third part of this Gospel presentation is the longest,  but it doesn't mean it necessarily is more important than the others. In some ways it's probably long.

It's about the resurrection of Jesus. It's probably longer because it's setting up the fact that the rest of the chapter  is going to be a lengthy, wonderful, remarkable treatment of the doctor of the resurrection  because it was an issue in the Corinthian church. But the point is he is now saying the third part is of the Gospel is history and the resurrection. He says that Christ died for sins according to the Scriptures. He was buried.

He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures. He appeared to seephus, that's Peter, then the twelve apostles after that he appeared  in more than 500 of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living,  then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, and last of all he appeared to me  and he's saying almost as if he had to come back and make a special trip  like I was born at the wrong time. But he even appeared to me. Now what's he talking about? The resurrection.

Why does the resurrection of Jesus Christ play an important role in the Gospel? It plays an important role because it's crucial to both, it's crucial in that the resurrection of Jesus  usures and secures are past and are future salvation. First of all, it usures and secures are past salvation. How do you know that Jesus dies on the cross actually paid for sins? How do you know it actually defeated sin?

How do you know that the punishment was taken? How do you know it's all paid? So that if you believe in him, there's no more condemnation for there. How do you know? Well see, if somebody was in debt in those days, they were either in slavery or maybe they'd be in prison.

And the only way you knew that the debt had been paid. And the way you could be sure you knew that debt had been paid was when they were released, when they were sprung. Then you knew that the debt had been paid. And of course, the wages of sin is death. And when Jesus Christ was sprung from death and he burst the bands of death, that's proof that it was paid.

That's proof that it was paid. If you're shopping in a store and you have a bag with some things you've already purchased,  there's nothing more unfortunate and kind of unpleasant than to have some plain clothesmen come up and say,  have you really bought those things? Let me look inside your bag. And you're irritated and you're feeling very bad, but what do you do? What you do is you reach in and you pull out what?

The receipt and you say, trouble me not. You say, be gone. Why? This is proof that your accusation has no merit. Do you know how to do that with a resurrection if you're a Christian?

Have you learned to do that yet? When your conscience goes after you, you've failed, you've done something really, really bad and it's killing you. Are you a Christian? Have you believed in Jesus Christ? Your conscience is killing.

Do you know how to get out the resurrection and say,  to your conscience, trouble me not? Be gone. This is my receipt. This proves that it was paid in full. This proves this stamps paid in full across history in such a way that nobody is ever going to miss it.

Do you know how to do that? So on the one hand, the resurrection assures and secures you, your past salvation,  but then secondly, it assures and secures the future salvation because our future salvation is not just  being forgiven and going and living in heaven as a soul. Our future is a resurrected body and a new heavens and a new earth and a place without suffering and death. Do you know what that's going to be like? What are our Tolkien in an essay called on fairy stories?

Try us to help us understand why we so love fairy tales or science fiction or what we call fantasy tales. We read them all the time. We watch them. We turn them into blockbuster pictures year after year after year. And then there you have magic and you have fantasy.

And he's trying to understand why in the world, especially in our modern age when we're very secular,  we're very scientific, and we know these stories are fiction. Why we still pour into the movie theater, we read the books, and we find ourselves moved. And he says, here's why, because these stories show us some things. They depict things that we long for, that we can't stop longing for. And here's what some of them are.

He says, we long for the ability to step outside of time. The idea of being able to step outside of time fascinates us. Secondly, we long for escape from death. Thirdly, we long for love without parting. Love that doesn't end.

It doesn't end with love without parting. Fourthly, we long. We're fascinated by the idea of having communication with non-human beings. And then lastly, he says, we actually, of course, long for a final defeat of evil. And so whenever we see these kinds of stories, they just fasten us.

We can never get enough of them because it scratches where we itch. We have this incredible longing for these things. But do you know that if the resurrection of Jesus Christ really happened  and if you believe in Him, all those things are actually literally going to come true? They're literally going to come true. And look, if you are skeptical of Christianity, okay, you're skeptical of Christianity,  but why wouldn't you want that to be true?

If you don't want that to be true, you're not being honest with yourself. And Christianity promises it. More than promises it. Essentially, it demonstrates it. It essentially proves it with a resurrection.

And that's the reason why he does all this. Why is he going on? He was seen by Seefus. He was seen by the 12th. He was seen by 500 people who are still, most of whom are still alive.

Richard Bauchem in his great book, Jesus and the eyewitnesses, points out that these are footnotes. See, if you're writing a serious academic work today, especially historical work,  you have to have footnotes. Why? Because your footnote basically says,  here's how you can find out that what I'm saying is right. So, for example, if you say, in such and such and such and such, this happened.

Well, what you do is you footnote the historical register in this particular library  where the original letter is or something like that. He says, footnotes are ways for you to say to the reader what I'm saying is true  and the footnote is a source from which you can find out that what I'm telling you is true. But see, in those days, if you're writing not legend, but history, how did you do a footnote? You said, here are the witnesses who are alive who saw it, you can go check. These are footnotes.

These are sources. And Paul was saying, there's hundreds of people who saw Jesus with their own eyes. Go talk to them. Most of them are still alive. There's only 20 years later at this point.

Do you see what that means? Paul is saying, the resurrection was not a symbol. It's not a nice story. It's not a legend. It's come down to us through the ages.

People saw him. There is evidence. And if that's the case and the stuff that you most long for in life,  the kind of world you most long for is available. It's there. Believe the gospel.

Look, at the very, very end. This ending is technically a testimony and is wonderful. Because see, the gospel ultimately is personal. It's not just a set up bullet points. And he says, for I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle,  because I persecuted the Church of God.

But by the grace of God, I am what I am. And his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than them all. Yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me. Look at three things, as we just said.

First of all, this is the gospels about grace. Notice three times he uses the word. The gospel is about grace, grace, grace. The reason my Lloyd Jones could use that diagnostic question and say to people,  are you a Christian? And if they said, well, I'm trying, trying very hard,  the reason he knew that they didn't understand the core of Christianity was because they didn't understand grace.

They're basically saying, well, if I work hard enough, then maybe God will bless me. Oh, my word. Do you, John Bunion, who wrote Pilgrim's progress in his autobiography,  Grace Abounding to the Truth, to the chief of sinners,  tells a story of how he probably got converted. He had been reading the Bible, and it just made him feel more guilty. But he said, one day, he just thought of something.

And he says in here, he says, one day, as I was passing through a field,  suddenly I thought of a sentence, a sentence. Your righteousness is in heaven. And he explains how then, with the eyes of faith, putting together things he'd read in the Bible,  he says, with the eyes of faith, I saw Christ sitting at God's right hand, and suddenly I realized,  there's my righteousness. God could not say, where is your righteousness today, for it was always right in front of him. My good frame of heart could not make my righteousness better, nor a bad frame of heart,  make my righteousness worse.

My righteousness was Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. And now my chains fell off indeed. I felt delivered from slavery to guilt and fears, and I saw that all those weak character qualities in my heart  were like the pennies that a rich man carries in his pocket when his goal is safe in a trunk at home. Grace, get grace until the grace penny drops you haven't got the gospel. Secondly, however, grace does not mean, okay, well, you're just accepted.

That's all there is to it, doesn't change you, of course it changes you, because he says, what? His grace to me was not without effect. Boy, and that is the understatement of the year. Because what he says is, I hated Christianity, and what he doesn't say is, I'm a brilliant man. See, Paul is one of the most influential people in the history of the world.

He was brilliant, and he hated Christianity, and yet Grace changed him. Well, how can Grace change you? Well, because Grace is undeserved, once you realize that God's grace is undeserved, it humbles you. But then when you also realize that Grace is unconditional, because it's undeserved, it takes you down. I'm no different than anybody else, but because it's unconditional, it brings you back up.

I'm always accepted, I'm always loved, peace, boldness, but because it was costly, it's absolutely free to you, God's grace. But it's infinitely costly to him, because of what he had to go through on the cross. It turns you into a sacrificial lover of other people. It was not without effect, it was not without effect. And lastly, it just fills you with wonder.

You see, he's almost, I just kind of amazed at himself. He's just looking at me saying, but by the grace of God, I am what I am. When you say something, when you, you know, Kathy pointed out to me that this week in the Tuesday of Science Times of the New York Times,  it talks about the fact that we're probably on the verge of finding a cure for hep C, which is a disease, by the way,  that kills more people than AIDS. It just gives you a miserable life while it's killing you. And it looks like possibly, they went to pains to say it's not for certain, but it looks like there's not just a vaccine, but a pill, just a pill, not even a vaccine,  that you take, and it can take it out of your body in a couple of months.

And of course, everybody who's hearing about it, they're just excited, they're astounded, they're amazed, they're telling each other, they're rushing. Of course, you're going to be like that. Of course, you're going to be like, think of the joy of knowing that the death sentence that was over you is taken away. Or are you going to tell everybody about it? Aren't you going to be amazed?

Well, listen, the gospel would be way more than that. We're talking about not just extending your life a few years. We're talking about love without parting, escape from death, communication with non-human beings. We're talking about everything you've ever wanted. How could you not be filled with joy?

How could you not want to tell people that it's praying? Our Father, we thank you for the gospel. We thank you for the glad, joyful tidings of the gospel. And we ask that the undeservedness, the unconditional nature of it, the costliness of it,  would change us the way it changed Paul, humbling us, empowering us, melting us, tenderizing us,  humanizing us. Oh, Father, forgive us for not walking in a manner worthy of the gospel, which means we're just not thinking,  just not thinking until the power of it just begins to change us.

And we ask that you would also teach us how to wincently tell people that we found the cure. We pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

the Scriptures,  that He was buried,  that He was raised on the third day  according to the Scriptures,  and that He appeared to seephus,  and then to the 12. After that, He appeared to more than 500  of the brothers and sisters at the same time,  most of whom are still living,  though some have fallen asleep. Then He appeared to James,  then to all the apostles,  and last of all, He appeared to me also  as to one abnormally born. For I am the least of the apostles  and do not even deserve to be called an apostle,  because I persecuted the Church of God. But by the grace of God,  I am what I am,  and His grace to me was not without effect.

No, I worked harder than all of them,  yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me. Whether then it is I or they,  this is what we preach,  and this is what you believed. Here ends the reading. So we're looking at,  for a number of weeks,  we're looking at the subject of public faith. What does it mean to talk about  your deepest beliefs,  who you are,  with others in public,  who may not share your beliefs,  and how do you do that in a way  that's transparent, that's honest.

The same time is respectful. It promotes peace. This is something that everyone in the plural  is excited and needs to learn how to do. And we've been looking at this each week. And today you come to maybe perhaps  one of the more obvious things that you have to talk about.

We need to talk about  if we're going to discuss this subject. And that is what actually  are the core beliefs of Christianity. You can't talk in public about Christianity,  unless at some point you get down to say,  well, what is it? What are the core things that Christians believe? What do you believe in order to be a Christian?

And if you're going to do that,  there's no better spot in the whole Bible than here. Sure, there's other places in the Bible,  but this has a special place  because look,  at the passage it was just read to you. Paul says,  now brothers and sisters,  I want to remind you of the gospel. I preach to you that you received  by this you were saved,  and I had received it,  and I passed it on to you,  and it's a first importance of the very end,  he says,  so whether it's higher they,  meaning the others that are apostles,  this is what we preach,  and this is what you believed. What he is giving you is not only a gospel presentation.

He says,  here's the gospel I preached to you. I received it. You believed it. It saved you. But he's also speaking in the book of 1 Corinthians,  and there's an amazing amount of consensus  that 1 Corinthians was written just 20 years after  the death of Jesus Christ,  that it was perhaps the oldest  of all the peeps of literature we have in the New Testament.

And if that's the case,  then when Paul talks about this is what I did before,  he says,  remember when I came before,  I'm giving you a summary of the gospel  that I received,  that I gave you,  that you believed,  that saved you,  he's talking about something that happened just a handful of years  after Jesus' death. So if you want to get down to the foundations,  what is Christianity all about? What is Christianity believed? What is the irreducible core  that you must believe to be a Christian  and to have spiritual life? Here it is, right here.

And the reason why it's so important to keep in mind  if you're doing public talking about this in public  is if you're a Christian,  it is so important to major in the majors. There's lots and lots of things that Christians believe  and there's lots of things that different branches of Christian  Christianity believe,  and some of them may be very true,  very dear to your heart,  but you really should not press and push and talk  about beliefs that a lot of other Christians don't even share. You ought to major in the majors and hear the majors. And if you're skeptical of Christianity,  it's also crucial to get straight what Christianity really is. Over the years when people talk to me about how they're skeptical,  they really don't believe,  and I ask them,  well, what do you think Christianity teaches?

They tell me,  and as gently as possible,  I have to point out that that's not what Christianity teaches. I usually say something like,  I don't know a single church in the whole world that believes that. And of course,  I try to say it a nice tone,  but since I use this illustration in the beginning  and I realize,  that's not very gentle is it? No, maybe I shouldn't put it that way,  but the deal is,  do you really understand the Christianity you think you're rejecting? David Martin Lloyd-Jones,  great British preacher,  had a question that he used to ask people,  that he considered a diagnostic question.

It's a simple question,  and he would say,  do you consider yourself a Christian? And the person would say,  yes or no, he said,  well, why? And if a person says,  why do you think I'm a Christian? I think I'm trying hard to live according to the teachings of the Bible. I'm trying very hard to live like Christ.

I'm trying very hard to surrender and be like him. And Dr. Lloyd-Jones says,  if somebody gives an answer like that,  he knows that even though that's very, very typical,  very typical,  that that person doesn't really understand the gospel,  doesn't understand the core teachings. This is the gospel. What is it?

Well, let's just move right through it. There's actually four parts to this. The gospel is about Jesus. It's about sin and substitution. It's about history and resurrection.

And it's about astonishing, transforming grace. Just right through it. Okay, so first of all,  it's about Jesus,  because see, for what I received,  I passed on to you as a first importance,  and as soon as he begins,  his summary of the gospel, he says,  that Christ,  and actually, everything else,  in the whole paragraph,  is just a set of clauses or phrases that explain Christ. They all point back to Christ. The gospel is Christ, actually.

The gospel is Jesus Christ. Now, how would that be? Well, the word gospel,  though many people understand the word gospel means joyful news. That's what the Greek word technically means. It was actually used to announce a history-changing event.

It was the word that meant,  it was usually used to announce something like  the carnation of a new king,  the defeat of an invading army,  something like that,  some major news event. And if that's the core,  if the core of Christian teaching is a gospel,  then right away we're confronted with  what makes Christianity different from all of the religions. See, all of the religions contain  narratives about their founders, of course. All of the religions tell stories and have narratives  about the lives of their founders. But their founders, all the other religions,  their founders are teachers not saviors.

And because their teachers not saviors,  their life story is not the core of the core of those religions. The core of the core of those religions,  like the five pillars of Islam  or the eightfold path to enlightenment of Buddhism,  the core of the core of those religions  is always a set of directions about what you must do. Since the founders are teachers,  the core of the core of those religions  is a set of directions about what you must do. But the core of the core of Christianity is a gospel. That's not a set of directions about what you must do.

It's an account of what has been done. It's not actually advice. Christianity is not advice about what you must do. It's news. It's news about what he has done.

And in fact, one of the most striking things about this whole passage  is from verse three all the way to the end,  this description of the gospel,  there's nothing in here about what you must do. In fact, the gospel in here doesn't even contain  that you must repent and believe. Now, of course, you must repent and believe the gospel. If it's to be operative in your life,  and he says so up in verse two,  he says which you received,  and you took your stand on it. But see, technically,  that's a response to the gospel.

It's not actually part of the gospel. Why? Because the gospel is that nothing you can do,  nothing you will do,  nothing you have ever done can be the basis  for your acceptance with God. It all happens to what Jesus Christ has done. There's nothing you have done,  nothing you can do, nothing you will do,  nothing you do can be the basis for your acceptance with God.

It all comes to what Jesus Christ has done. So even repenting and believing is an actually part  of the gospel, technically,  it's a response to the gospel. And of course, the gospel brings massive changes to your life. It makes you an agent of reconciliation,  injustice, and love in the world. It profoundly changes your character.

It changes the very structure of your identity. It changes the very pathways of your heart. It changes the way your heart works. And yet, those are results of the gospel. You never find the authors of the scripture.

You never find the apostles or Paul ever loading that  into the gospel as if that's part of it. No. In a sense, the gospel is Jesus Christ. It is Jesus. So first of all, it's about Christ.

Secondly, though, it's about sin and substitution. Okay, so what's the first thing Jesus... Oh, we're told about Jesus. It says that Christ died for our sins. Die for our sins.

The very first thing, sin and substitution. First of all, sin. The first thing that we're told about what Jesus came to do  is deal with sin. We are uninformed and we need wisdom. Yes.

We are sufferers and we need help. We need support. We need relief. Yes. But, what we're learning here is,  first of all, we're sinners needing salvation.

That is to say, sin is our most fundamental human problem. And I got that takes a little bit of explanation. He said, why is that? Well, first of all, sin means that if God created you,  and if there is a God who created you  and who sustains you every single second,  and keeps you actually together from... You may say it's gravity.

Well, okay, where's that from? Or it's the way... It's the way, you know, the electrons stay in orbit  around the nucleus. What's keeping that together? You are being held together every second by God.

If there is a God who created you and sustains you  and who does all that,  then you owe him everything. Or, you owe it not to him just to pray  when you're in trouble or something like that. You owe it to live for him, to live for him totally. But sin is the teaching of the Bible. That, of course, you know this.

We don't live for him. We don't live for God. We don't live for our neighbor. We live for ourselves. We tend to live selfishly.

We've ruined the world. That's sin. But, well, see, to say he died for sin  means that that's our fundamental problem. Everything else comes from that because we're alienated from our maker. And we need...

The word alienation doesn't... You know, it's not used very much. But I want you to see how important it is. And I think I can do that by just giving you a simple illustration. Sin means we're personally and legally alienated from our maker.

There's a barrier there. And Jesus came to do something about it. And before he can do anything else,  he has to do that. So imagine you have a friend. You've been friends for a good long time.

Something changes. First, you notice your friend uses things that you give your friend  without acknowledgement, without gratitude. Then it gets worse. You find your friend lying to you, breaking promises,  and then lying to you. And finally, it gets terrible.

Your friend embezzles money from you because you're maybe in business together. We're just steals from you and robs from you. And after all this comes out, your friend sits down and says,  oh, can we stay friends because I really... I'll try to do better. I'll try to live better.

And I'm very sorry. And what are you going to say? Now, you'll use your own words. And you'll use your own words. But essentially, you're going to say,  hmm, we are in a state of alienation.

It's both legal and personal. Because what you're going to say is,  look, I know you're sorry. I guess you're sorry. And of course, if we're ever going to be friends again,  if this state of alienation is going to go away,  you will have to be sorry. But it won't be enough just to do better.

What are we going to do about what you did to me? You've robbed. There's a debt. There's a crime. Bad things have happened.

There's an injustice that has to be dealt with  if we are ever going to be friends again. See? Personal and legal. And of course, with God,  it would be writ infinitely larger  because you have an infinite God. Then you have an infinite debt.

You have an infinite crime. And there's a barrier. And that's the reason why Jesus could not come as a teacher. Because teachers come and say,  here's how you can be sorry and do a little better. That doesn't deal with the problem.

Doesn't deal with the alienation. Does it? Doesn't deal with the barrier. And Jesus came to deal with the barrier. How?

Substitution. This little word four is not very revealing to us  because our English word four, F-O-R,  covers such an enormous range of meanings. You have to have to sit and think and reflect before you know  in what way something is for something else. There's all sorts of categories. Fortunately, Greek had more prepositions that serviced.

And the preposition used here is who pair which means  on behalf of in the place of. As a substitute. This is saying that Jesus Christ died on behalf of us. He was a substitute. He died instead of us.

He took what we deserve. In other words, Jesus Christ took our place. The place we deserve to be cast out on the cross. And if we believe in Him,  then we get the place that He deserved at the table in the family. Love, child of God.

Second Corinthians 5, 21, God made Him sin, who knew no sin,  that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. Now, there's a lot of different metaphors  that the Bible uses to try to describe what happened on the cross. There's the language of the marketplace. Sometimes it talks about that Jesus Christ on the cross paid a price. Why?

Because sin is a debt. We just talked about that. And in the olden days, if you had a debt, you couldn't pay. You went into slavery until you could pay it. And Jesus Christ, we're told in the Bible, is our ransom.

He redeems us out of slavery. He pays the price. And so we're liberated. So you have the language of the marketplace and sin is a debt. Another kind of language is used to deal with the cross.

It's the language of the battlefield. You know why? Because sin is not just a debt. It's not just a legal debt. It's a powerful evil force.

It's in you and me. It makes us do things we hate. That's the reason why Paul, you know, in Romans 7 says,  very often I find I'm doing the very thing I hate. It absorbs us with ourselves and fills us with fears  and fills us with all sorts of things. And we do things we don't like to do.

It's a force inside. Of course, it's a force outside. People can wrong us. And Jesus Christ comes. And the Bible, some places talks about Jesus going to the cross  to defeat the powers of evil and sin and death.

And it's a terrible struggle. And he suffers horribly. But in the end, he fights and he wins for us. So there's the language of the marketplace, the language of the battlefield. There's also the language of the law court.

The language of the law court says that sin is also a violation of a standard. And if there is a God, you want him to be against evil and injustice, don't you? You don't want God to be passive. You don't want your God just to look on. You want him to do something about it.

You want him to be judicially wrathful against evil and injustice. But then to see if we have any evil in sin in us,  then that wrath, that judicial wrath, that condemnation lies on us,  but Jesus Christ comes and takes the punishment that we deserve. Now, as different as that is, there's others, there's others. But all those metaphors are wonderful because they show different aspects of the human problem  and they show different wonderful aspects of the rich salvation we have. But do you notice there's a thread running through all of them?

Every single one of them. Substitution. Jesus fights. Jesus pays. Jesus bears what we couldn't bear.

And that's the reason why John's thought in one of the best passages in all of his writings. He was an Anglican minister, British Anglican minister. He says that the concept of substitution is crucial to understand both sin and salvation. If you want to understand the gospel, you've got to understand substitution. Because on the one hand, what is sin?

It's you substituting yourself for God, putting yourself for only God deserves to be. In charge of your own life, you didn't make yourself. But see, when you say, I'm going to call the shots of my own life, what are you saying? I'm my own maker. I'm my own creator.

When you act as if you're your own maker and your creator and your own creator,  and you're not, it's kind of cosmic plagiarism, you know? And when you put yourself in that place and you're woefully under, by the way,  you're woefully under qualified for the job of being Lord of your life. Woefully under. See, sin is you substituting yourself for God. Well, salvation is God substituting himself for you, putting himself where you deserve to be.

God going to the cross and taking his own punishment. Now, sin is substitution. Very first thing out of Paul's mouth, when he's summarizing the thing that changed people's lives  at the beginning of the beginning of the Christian movement, at the core of the core of all Christian beliefs. And yeah, even though I love to run on and I want to go on,  I need to stop for a little bit because this, as important as this is,  as core as this is to Christianity, it flies right in the face of our culture. The idea that all people are sinners, that Jesus Christ had to go to the cross,  take our punishment, a swage, propitiate is the old word, the wrath of God,  satisfy the wrath of God, that just wrinkles at a hundred levels in our culture.

But I would like to just briefly, therefore, deal with a couple of issues, kind of loose ends. One is I would like to respond to the objection that this is a primitive bloodthirsty idea,  this idea of Jesus Christ going to the cross, substituting himself. And I'd also like to show you that this is the most democratic egalitarian, possible doctrine. So first of all, one of the charges is this whole idea that Jesus Christ goes  and He has to shed His blood in order to satisfy the punishment and wrath of God. Many people say, that's just incredible.

It's just like the ancient primitive pagan terrible religions. They're all bloody with all that sacrifice stuff. J.I. Packer in his great book, Knowing God, has a chapter in which he deals with this subject. And he brings out a perfect example of what people mean when they think about primitive pagan bloodthirsty religion.

He talks about the Iliad, Homer's Iliad. And in the Iliad, some of you know, probably from sixth grade, you know. The Greek army has taken ship to go to Troy. Remember because Prince Paris has taken Helen away. And the general of the Greek army, which was Agamemnon,  finds that they can't say, oh, why?

Because of contrary wins. Because the gods for some reason are angry at them. So Agamemnon sends for his daughter and ceremonially slaughters her as a sacrifice,  malifies the hostile gods. The old word was propitiation. He propities the wrath of the gods and then they can sail to Troy.

That was the, by the way, if you learn this in sixth grade, they probably left that part out. They left it out for me when I actually started reading. I said, why didn't they tell me the best stuff, you know. Well, people say, there we go. Oh, my word.

Here's a father who sacrifices his daughter, his child,  to malify the gods, to propitiate their wrath. This is terrible. And Christianity is just like that. It's primitive and bloodthirsty just like that. And J.R.

Packer says, no, no. Not only is it not like that, it's utterly different. Why? And here's what he says. He says, in paganism, man propituates his gods.

And religion becomes a form of commercialism and indeed of bribery. In Christianity, however, God propities his own wrath  through his own sacrificial action of love. See, as God comes in Jesus Christ and goes  and he takes his own punishment, it's utterly different. It's the reverse of ancient primitive bloodthirsty religion. Don't say that.

Now, secondly, I'd like to say something on the contrary about this doctrine of substitutionism. It's radically egalitarian and democratic. And if you think, you say, boy, that's kind of weird. I want you to look at the little word in here right in the beginning of the gospel presentation,  where Paul says Christ died for our sins. You know what's so interesting about that?

There's a world of meaning in that. Paul did not say for your sins. Paul was a Hebrew of the Hebrews. Paul tells us about what an incredibly fastidious, godly religious person he was. He poured over the Bible and he tried to find anything the Bible says that we should do.

And he did everything he possibly could in order to comply with every single aspect of God's law. And did everything he could. And yet here he is saying what? That Jesus Christ substituted himself and died for our sins, meaning I deserve to die too. My record deserves death.

Now, if that seems absolutely inexplicable to you, you need to read the book of Romans chapters one, two, and three,  where he, in a very top level summary of that. He spends one chapter talking about the pagans. Yes, the Gentiles, the people who didn't believe the Bible,  and they don't follow the biblical rules of chastity and purity and integrity and so on. But then he turns to people who believe the Bible. And he shows that though externally, they're obeying the Bible inside their motivation is not for love of God, but for love of self.

Inside their self-righteousness, there's pride. And he gets to chapter three, and he says, therefore, all have sinned and falls short of the glory of God. And he says, no one is righteous, no not one. No one is really even seeking for God. It's an amazing statement.

Because here's what Paul is saying. Paul is saying, the people that all of my life I was taught to despise, the Gentiles, the people that I wouldn't even want to eat with,  because they're unclean. They don't follow the Bible. The people that I've always despised, now I'm spending my whole life with. I'm spending my whole life with them.

Why? Because we're not really any different. He says, I'm really no better than a criminal that slits people's throats and takes their money. In the end, though, of course, we're lost in different ways. In the end, though, we violate the law of God in different ways.

In the end, we all fail to love God without our hard soul strength and our neighbors ourselves in different ways. And therefore, we're all equally sinners. We're all equally lost and we're all equally in need of God's grace. That is the most radically egalitarian humanizing doctrine there is. Look at Paul.

What turned him from a self-righteous racist into a person who embraces all people as his equals ought to say what? It was the gospel. It humanized him. Because every other religion and philosophy says this is what you must do to get saved. This is what you must do to find God.

This is what you must do to save the world. This is what you must do in order to be a good person or a moral person. In which case, there's always a bunch of people over here not doing what you think should be done. And therefore, you have to say, oh, look, they're not doing this. But see, Paul says it doesn't matter.

Liberal conservative, moral immoral, you know, avant-garde, respectable. This race, that race, it doesn't matter. We're all sinners. We're all in need of grace. How radically humanizing that is.

How radically egalitarian that is. You know why? Because we're all the problem with this world. You can't look in every, I think every other philosophy I know. Every other political platform I know.

Every other religion I know basically says we know what we should be doing. And these people over here are the problem with the world. And of course, Paul says, no, no, no, no. We're all the problem. You know, Agatha Christie's novel, Murder on the Orient Express.

It's her detective, Paul Rowe. It's stuck on a train, stuck in a snow drift. And a man is murdered. And he's trying to figure out who was the murderer. And he's on the train with 12 other passengers.

So which of the 12 has done the murder? So he's trying to figure it out. And this is the hardest one he's ever seen. Because all the clues are pointing in different ways. And he realizes he's missing something.

He's missing something. What is the key insight that will make sense of everything? What is the key insight that will make sense of everything? Well, the surprise answer, and I'm going to tell you. And if anybody complains about spoilers, I want you to know that this book has been out for 80 years.

And if you haven't read it or seen it, I don't want to hear it. You know what the key insight is? Everybody done it. All 12 people murdered the man together. And suddenly everything makes sense.

They're all the villains. They're all the murders. They're all in it. Okay. This is the clue the Gospel gives you,  without which your life won't make sense.

Society won't make sense. And history won't make sense. We're all in it. We're all in it. No one is right.

Just no not one. Most democratic, egalitarian doctrine. Okay, now thirdly. The third part of this Gospel presentation is the longest,  but it doesn't mean it necessarily is more important than the others. In some ways it's probably long.

It's about the resurrection of Jesus. It's probably longer because it's setting up the fact that the rest of the chapter  is going to be a lengthy, wonderful, remarkable treatment of the doctor of the resurrection  because it was an issue in the Corinthian church. But the point is he is now saying the third part is of the Gospel is history and the resurrection. He says that Christ died for sins according to the Scriptures. He was buried.

He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures. He appeared to seephus, that's Peter, then the twelve apostles after that he appeared  in more than 500 of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living,  then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, and last of all he appeared to me  and he's saying almost as if he had to come back and make a special trip  like I was born at the wrong time. But he even appeared to me. Now what's he talking about? The resurrection.

Why does the resurrection of Jesus Christ play an important role in the Gospel? It plays an important role because it's crucial to both, it's crucial in that the resurrection of Jesus  usures and secures are past and are future salvation. First of all, it usures and secures are past salvation. How do you know that Jesus dies on the cross actually paid for sins? How do you know it actually defeated sin?

How do you know that the punishment was taken? How do you know it's all paid? So that if you believe in him, there's no more condemnation for there. How do you know? Well see, if somebody was in debt in those days, they were either in slavery or maybe they'd be in prison.

And the only way you knew that the debt had been paid. And the way you could be sure you knew that debt had been paid was when they were released, when they were sprung. Then you knew that the debt had been paid. And of course, the wages of sin is death. And when Jesus Christ was sprung from death and he burst the bands of death, that's proof that it was paid.

That's proof that it was paid. If you're shopping in a store and you have a bag with some things you've already purchased,  there's nothing more unfortunate and kind of unpleasant than to have some plain clothesmen come up and say,  have you really bought those things? Let me look inside your bag. And you're irritated and you're feeling very bad, but what do you do? What you do is you reach in and you pull out what?

The receipt and you say, trouble me not. You say, be gone. Why? This is proof that your accusation has no merit. Do you know how to do that with a resurrection if you're a Christian?

Have you learned to do that yet? When your conscience goes after you, you've failed, you've done something really, really bad and it's killing you. Are you a Christian? Have you believed in Jesus Christ? Your conscience is killing.

Do you know how to get out the resurrection and say,  to your conscience, trouble me not? Be gone. This is my receipt. This proves that it was paid in full. This proves this stamps paid in full across history in such a way that nobody is ever going to miss it.

Do you know how to do that? So on the one hand, the resurrection assures and secures you, your past salvation,  but then secondly, it assures and secures the future salvation because our future salvation is not just  being forgiven and going and living in heaven as a soul. Our future is a resurrected body and a new heavens and a new earth and a place without suffering and death. Do you know what that's going to be like? What are our Tolkien in an essay called on fairy stories?

Try us to help us understand why we so love fairy tales or science fiction or what we call fantasy tales. We read them all the time. We watch them. We turn them into blockbuster pictures year after year after year. And then there you have magic and you have fantasy.

And he's trying to understand why in the world, especially in our modern age when we're very secular,  we're very scientific, and we know these stories are fiction. Why we still pour into the movie theater, we read the books, and we find ourselves moved. And he says, here's why, because these stories show us some things. They depict things that we long for, that we can't stop longing for. And here's what some of them are.

He says, we long for the ability to step outside of time. The idea of being able to step outside of time fascinates us. Secondly, we long for escape from death. Thirdly, we long for love without parting. Love that doesn't end.

It doesn't end with love without parting. Fourthly, we long. We're fascinated by the idea of having communication with non-human beings. And then lastly, he says, we actually, of course, long for a final defeat of evil. And so whenever we see these kinds of stories, they just fasten us.

We can never get enough of them because it scratches where we itch. We have this incredible longing for these things. But do you know that if the resurrection of Jesus Christ really happened  and if you believe in Him, all those things are actually literally going to come true? They're literally going to come true. And look, if you are skeptical of Christianity, okay, you're skeptical of Christianity,  but why wouldn't you want that to be true?

If you don't want that to be true, you're not being honest with yourself. And Christianity promises it. More than promises it. Essentially, it demonstrates it. It essentially proves it with a resurrection.

And that's the reason why he does all this. Why is he going on? He was seen by Seefus. He was seen by the 12th. He was seen by 500 people who are still, most of whom are still alive.

Richard Bauchem in his great book, Jesus and the eyewitnesses, points out that these are footnotes. See, if you're writing a serious academic work today, especially historical work,  you have to have footnotes. Why? Because your footnote basically says,  here's how you can find out that what I'm saying is right. So, for example, if you say, in such and such and such and such, this happened.

Well, what you do is you footnote the historical register in this particular library  where the original letter is or something like that. He says, footnotes are ways for you to say to the reader what I'm saying is true  and the footnote is a source from which you can find out that what I'm telling you is true. But see, in those days, if you're writing not legend, but history, how did you do a footnote? You said, here are the witnesses who are alive who saw it, you can go check. These are footnotes.

These are sources. And Paul was saying, there's hundreds of people who saw Jesus with their own eyes. Go talk to them. Most of them are still alive. There's only 20 years later at this point.

Do you see what that means? Paul is saying, the resurrection was not a symbol. It's not a nice story. It's not a legend. It's come down to us through the ages.

People saw him. There is evidence. And if that's the case and the stuff that you most long for in life,  the kind of world you most long for is available. It's there. Believe the gospel.

Look, at the very, very end. This ending is technically a testimony and is wonderful. Because see, the gospel ultimately is personal. It's not just a set up bullet points. And he says, for I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle,  because I persecuted the Church of God.

But by the grace of God, I am what I am. And his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than them all. Yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me. Look at three things, as we just said.

First of all, this is the gospels about grace. Notice three times he uses the word. The gospel is about grace, grace, grace. The reason my Lloyd Jones could use that diagnostic question and say to people,  are you a Christian? And if they said, well, I'm trying, trying very hard,  the reason he knew that they didn't understand the core of Christianity was because they didn't understand grace.

They're basically saying, well, if I work hard enough, then maybe God will bless me. Oh, my word. Do you, John Bunion, who wrote Pilgrim's progress in his autobiography,  Grace Abounding to the Truth, to the chief of sinners,  tells a story of how he probably got converted. He had been reading the Bible, and it just made him feel more guilty. But he said, one day, he just thought of something.

And he says in here, he says, one day, as I was passing through a field,  suddenly I thought of a sentence, a sentence. Your righteousness is in heaven. And he explains how then, with the eyes of faith, putting together things he'd read in the Bible,  he says, with the eyes of faith, I saw Christ sitting at God's right hand, and suddenly I realized,  there's my righteousness. God could not say, where is your righteousness today, for it was always right in front of him. My good frame of heart could not make my righteousness better, nor a bad frame of heart,  make my righteousness worse.

My righteousness was Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. And now my chains fell off indeed. I felt delivered from slavery to guilt and fears, and I saw that all those weak character qualities in my heart  were like the pennies that a rich man carries in his pocket when his goal is safe in a trunk at home. Grace, get grace until the grace penny drops you haven't got the gospel. Secondly, however, grace does not mean, okay, well, you're just accepted.

That's all there is to it, doesn't change you, of course it changes you, because he says, what? His grace to me was not without effect. Boy, and that is the understatement of the year. Because what he says is, I hated Christianity, and what he doesn't say is, I'm a brilliant man. See, Paul is one of the most influential people in the history of the world.

He was brilliant, and he hated Christianity, and yet Grace changed him. Well, how can Grace change you? Well, because Grace is undeserved, once you realize that God's grace is undeserved, it humbles you. But then when you also realize that Grace is unconditional, because it's undeserved, it takes you down. I'm no different than anybody else, but because it's unconditional, it brings you back up.

I'm always accepted, I'm always loved, peace, boldness, but because it was costly, it's absolutely free to you, God's grace. But it's infinitely costly to him, because of what he had to go through on the cross. It turns you into a sacrificial lover of other people. It was not without effect, it was not without effect. And lastly, it just fills you with wonder.

You see, he's almost, I just kind of amazed at himself. He's just looking at me saying, but by the grace of God, I am what I am. When you say something, when you, you know, Kathy pointed out to me that this week in the Tuesday of Science Times of the New York Times,  it talks about the fact that we're probably on the verge of finding a cure for hep C, which is a disease, by the way,  that kills more people than AIDS. It just gives you a miserable life while it's killing you. And it looks like possibly, they went to pains to say it's not for certain, but it looks like there's not just a vaccine, but a pill, just a pill, not even a vaccine,  that you take, and it can take it out of your body in a couple of months.

And of course, everybody who's hearing about it, they're just excited, they're astounded, they're amazed, they're telling each other, they're rushing. Of course, you're going to be like that. Of course, you're going to be like, think of the joy of knowing that the death sentence that was over you is taken away. Or are you going to tell everybody about it? Aren't you going to be amazed?

Well, listen, the gospel would be way more than that. We're talking about not just extending your life a few years. We're talking about love without parting, escape from death, communication with non-human beings. We're talking about everything you've ever wanted. How could you not be filled with joy?

How could you not want to tell people that it's praying? Our Father, we thank you for the gospel. We thank you for the glad, joyful tidings of the gospel. And we ask that the undeservedness, the unconditional nature of it, the costliness of it,  would change us the way it changed Paul, humbling us, empowering us, melting us, tenderizing us,  humanizing us. Oh, Father, forgive us for not walking in a manner worthy of the gospel, which means we're just not thinking,  just not thinking until the power of it just begins to change us.

And we ask that you would also teach us how to wincently tell people that we found the cure. We pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.

### 中文翻译

照着圣经所说，祂为我们的罪死了，祂被埋葬了，又照着圣经所说，第三天从死里复活了，并且显给矶法看，然后显给十二使徒看。此后，祂曾一时显给五百多位弟兄姊妹看，其中大多数到如今还在，然而也有已经睡了的。后来显给雅各看，再显给众使徒看，末了也显给我看；我好像未到产期而生的人一般。因为我原是使徒中最小的，不配称为使徒，因为我从前逼迫　神的教会。然而我今日成了何等人，是蒙　神的恩才成的；并且祂所赐我的恩不是徒然的。

不，我比众人更劳苦；其实不是我，乃是　神的恩与我同在。无论是我，是他们，我们如此传，你们也如此信。读经到此为止。我们在好几个星期里一直在看一个主题：公开的信仰。所谓公开的信仰，就是在公共场合与他人谈论你最深的信念、你是谁——而这些人可能并不认同你的信念——并且你要怎样以一种透明、诚实的方式去做。

同时也要尊重他人，促进和平。这是一个多元社会里每个人都会兴奋、也都需要学习去做的事。我们每周都在看这个主题。今天我们来到了一个也许更显而易见、你必须要谈到的内容。

如果我们要讨论这个主题，就必须谈到一件事：基督教的核心信仰到底是什么。你不可能在公共场合谈论基督教，却从不落到这一点：它究竟是什么？基督徒相信的核心是什么？要成为一个基督徒，你必须相信什么？

若要这样做，整本圣经里没有比这里更好的地方。当然，圣经里还有别的地方，但这里有一种特别的地位。你看刚才读给你听的这段经文，保罗说：“弟兄姊妹，我要提醒你们我传给你们的福音。你们领受了这福音，靠着它得救。我自己也领受了，又传给你们；这乃是最重要的。”到最后他又说：“无论是我，是他们——指其他使徒——我们这样传，你们也这样信。”他给你的不仅仅是一段福音的讲解。

他说：“这是我传给你们的福音；我领受了，你们信了，这福音救了你们。”而且他是在《哥林多前书》里说这些话；学界有一个非常惊人的共识：这卷书写成时距离耶稣基督的死大约只有二十年，它也许是新约里我们所拥有的最早的基督教文献之一。

如果是这样，当保罗说“这是我以前做过的事”——他在说“记得我先前来的时候”——他给你的是他所领受、所传递、你们所信并使你们得救的福音摘要；他讲的事情，发生在耶稣死后不过短短几年。因此，如果你想追溯到根基：基督教到底是什么？基督教相信什么？那不可再削减的核心是什么——你必须相信它才能成为基督徒并得着属灵生命？就在这里，就在这一段。

而在公共场合谈论信仰时，这一点格外重要：如果你是基督徒，你必须在“重要的事”上用力。基督徒相信的事情很多，不同的基督教传统也有很多各自强调的内容，其中一些也许非常真实、非常触动你，但你不该把那些许多其他基督徒甚至并不共同持守的信念拿来强推、猛讲。你应该抓住“要紧的事”，把要紧的事讲清楚。

如果你对基督教持怀疑态度，同样也必须先弄清楚基督教到底是什么。多年下来，人们跟我说他们为何怀疑、为何不信；我问他们：“那你觉得基督教在教什么？”他们告诉我之后，我往往只能尽可能温和地指出：那并不是基督教的教导。我通常会说类似这样的话：“我不知道全世界有哪一间教会会那样相信。”当然我会尽量用友善的语气，但我开头用了这个例子，现在意识到——那其实也不算很温柔，是吧？也许我不该那样说。但问题在于：你真的明白你所要拒绝的那个基督教吗？

大卫·马丁·劳埃德-琼斯，这位伟大的英国传道人，过去常问人一个问题，他认为这是一个诊断性的问题。问题很简单，他会说：“你认为自己是基督徒吗？”对方回答“是”或“不是”，他就问：“为什么？”如果一个人说：“你为什么觉得我是基督徒？因为我努力按着圣经的教导生活。我很努力像基督那样活。我很努力降服，像祂一样。”劳埃德-琼斯博士说，若有人这样回答，他就知道——尽管这非常典型、极其典型——那人其实并不真正明白福音，不明白核心教导。福音是什么？到底是什么？

我们就按着经文往下走。这里实际上有四个部分：福音关乎耶稣；关乎罪与代替；关乎历史与复活；并且关乎令人震惊、带来生命改变的恩典。我们逐一来看。

第一，它关乎耶稣。因为保罗说：“我当日所领受又传给你们的，乃是最重要的：基督……”他一开始总结福音，就说“基督”。实际上，整段后面的内容都只是一些从句或短语，用来解释“基督”；它们都指向基督。福音其实就是基督。

福音就是耶稣基督。怎么会这样呢？“福音”这个词，很多人知道它的意思是“喜讯”，这确实是希腊词的技术性含义。它原本是用来宣布一个会改变历史的事件：比如一位新王登基，或一支入侵军队被击败之类的重大新闻。

如果基督教核心教导是一则“福音”，那我们立刻就会碰到一个问题：基督教与所有宗教的不同在哪里？当然，所有宗教都包含关于其创始人的叙事；都讲故事，都有关于创始人生平的叙述。但其他宗教的创始人是教师，不是救主。

因为他们是教师，不是救主，所以他们的生平故事并不是那些宗教“核心中的核心”。那些宗教的核心中的核心——比如伊斯兰的五功，或佛教通往觉悟的八正道——永远是一套指示：你必须做什么。

既然创始人是教师，那些宗教的核心中的核心就总是一套指示：你必须做什么。但基督教的核心中的核心是一则福音——那不是一套关于你必须做什么的指示，而是关于已经发生了什么、已经做成了什么的记述。它不是建议。基督教不是给你“你必须做什么”的忠告；它是新闻，是关于祂已经做了什么的消息。

事实上，这段经文最引人注目的事情之一就是：从第3节一直到末尾，这段对福音的描述里，没有任何关于“你必须做什么”的内容。甚至这里的福音都不包含“你必须悔改并相信”。当然，你必须悔改并相信福音，它才会在你生命中发生作用；保罗在第2节也说到了：你们领受了，并且站立得住。但从严格意义上说，那是对福音的回应，不是福音本身。

为什么？因为福音是：你能做的、你将要做的、你曾经做过的任何事，都不能成为你被　神接纳的基础。一切都在于耶稣基督所做成的。你所做的、你能做的、你将做的、你正在做的，没有任何一样能成为你被　神接纳的基础；一切都归结于耶稣基督所做成的。

所以即便“悔改并相信”也从技术意义上说不是福音的一部分，而是对福音的回应。当然，福音会给你的生命带来巨大改变：它使你成为世界中促成和解、公义与爱的媒介；它深刻改变你的品格；它改变你身份认同的结构；它改变你内心的路径；它改变你的心如何运作。然而这些都是福音的结果。

你从来不会发现圣经作者、使徒或保罗把这些“装进”福音里，好像它们属于福音本身。不。某种意义上，福音就是耶稣基督，就是耶稣。所以第一，它关乎基督。

第二，它关乎罪与代替。那关于耶稣的第一件事是什么？经文说：“基督为我们的罪死了。”为我们的罪死。

开宗明义：罪与代替。先说罪。关于耶稣来要做的第一件事，是处理罪。我们无知，需要智慧；我们受苦，需要帮助、支持、缓解——是的。但这里告诉我们：首先，我们是罪人，需要拯救。也就是说，罪是我们最根本的人类问题。

这需要一点解释。你说，为什么？首先，罪意味着：如果　神创造了你——如果确实有一位创造你、并且每一秒都托住你、让你不至于散架的　神——你也许说是重力，好吧，那又从哪来？或是电子围绕原子核运行的方式——是什么在维系这一切？你每一秒都被　神托住。

如果有一位创造你并持续托住你的　神，那么你就欠祂一切。你不只是欠祂在遇到麻烦时祷告一下而已；你欠祂完全为祂而活、彻底为祂而活。但圣经的教导是——你也知道——我们并不为祂而活。我们不为　神而活，也不为邻舍而活；我们为自己而活。我们倾向于自私地活。

我们毁坏了世界，这就是罪。但“祂为罪而死”意味着：那是我们最根本的问题，其他一切都由此而来，因为我们与创造我们的主隔绝了。

“隔绝”这个词用得不多，但我想让你看到它有多重要。我用一个简单的比喻来说明：罪意味着我们在个人层面与法律层面都与造物主隔绝；中间有一道障碍。耶稣来就是为此做点什么。在祂能做其他任何事之前，祂必须先处理这个。

想象你有一个朋友，你们做朋友很久。后来事情变了。起初你注意到，你的朋友使用你给的东西，却不表示感谢、不承认。接着更糟：你发现他对你撒谎，违背承诺，然后还继续撒谎。最后到了可怕的地步：他从你这里侵吞钱财——也许你们一起做生意——或者干脆偷你、抢你。

当这一切曝光后，他坐下来对你说：“我们还能做朋友吗？因为我真的……我会努力变好，我会努力活得更好。我很抱歉。”你会怎么说？你会用你自己的话说，但本质上你会说：“嗯，我们现在处在一种隔绝的状态。”这既是法律上的，也是个人上的。

因为你会说：“我知道你抱歉，至少我想你是抱歉的。若我们有一天要再成为朋友，你当然必须抱歉。但光说以后做得更好并不够。我们要怎么处理你对我做过的事？你抢了我；这里有债；这里有罪行；这里发生了坏事；这里有不公义——如果我们要再成为朋友，就必须把它处理掉。”

看见了吗？个人与法律。对　神而言，这就要无限放大，因为祂是无限的　神，于是债是无限的，罪行是无限的，障碍也在那里。也正因如此，耶稣不能只作为一位教师来。教师来会说：“你该怎样抱歉、怎样稍微变好一点。”这并不能解决问题。

它不能解决隔绝，不能解决障碍。耶稣来就是为了解决这道障碍。怎么解决？代替。

这里的小词“为”（for）在英文里并不太显明，因为 F-O-R 覆盖的意义范围太大了。你得坐下来想一想，才知道某件事“为”另一件事究竟是哪一种“为”。有很多类别。好在希腊语有更多介词。

这里用的介词是 huper，意思是“代表……、代替……，在……的位置上”。作为替代。就是说耶稣基督是代表我们而死；祂是替代；祂替我们死。

祂承担了我们该受的。换言之，耶稣基督替代了我们：我们本该被弃绝、被挂在十字架上；而若我们信祂，我们就得着祂本该得的座位——在家中桌前，在家里，蒙爱，成为　神的儿女。

《哥林多后书》5章21节：“　神使那无罪的替我们成为罪，好叫我们在祂里面成为　神的义。”圣经用许多不同的比喻来描述十字架上发生了什么：有“市场”的语言——有时说耶稣基督在十字架上付了代价。为什么？因为罪是一笔债。我们刚说过。

古时候如果你欠债还不起，你就会沦为奴隶，直到还清。圣经告诉我们，耶稣基督是我们的赎价；祂把我们从奴役中救赎出来，付清代价，于是我们得释放。这是市场语言，罪是债。

还有另一类语言用于十字架：战场语言。为什么？因为罪不只是债，不只是法律上的债；它是一股强大的邪恶力量，在你我里面。

它使我们去做我们自己都恨的事。保罗在《罗马书》7章说：“我常常发现自己在做我所恨的事。”罪把我们吸进自我之中，充满惧怕和各种东西，使我们做不想做的事。

它是一股里面的力量；当然也是外面的力量——人会伤害我们。耶稣基督来，有些地方圣经说祂上十字架是为了击败邪恶、罪与死亡的权势；这是一场可怕的争战，祂受尽痛苦，但最后祂为我们争战并得胜。

还有法庭语言：罪也是对标准的违犯。若有　神，你难道不希望祂反对邪恶与不公义吗？你不希望　神无动于衷；你不希望你的　神只是旁观。你希望祂对邪恶与不公义有审判性的忿怒。

但若我们里面也有邪恶与罪，那么那忿怒、那审判性的忿怒、那定罪就落在我们身上；于是耶稣基督来，承担我们该受的刑罚。

还有别的比喻。所有这些比喻都美妙，因为它们从不同角度呈现人类问题，也呈现我们所拥有之丰富救恩的不同荣耀面向。但你注意到贯穿其中的一条线吗？每一个比喻都是：代替。

耶稣争战；耶稣偿付；耶稣承担我们不能承担的。这也是约翰·斯托得在他所有写作中最好的段落之一里所说的：代替这一概念对理解罪与救恩都至关重要。要理解福音，你必须理解代替。

因为一方面，罪是什么？是你用自己取代　神，把自己放在只有　神配得的位置上——掌控自己的人生。你并没有创造自己，但当你说“我要自己做主”，你在说什么？你在说“我是自己的创造者”。

当你把自己当作造物主、当作创造者，而你却不是——这就像宇宙级的抄袭。并且当你把自己放到那个位置上时，顺便说一句，你对“作你生命的主”这个工作严重不合格——严重不合格。

所以，罪是你用自己取代　神；救恩则是　神用自己取代你，把自己放在你该在的位置上：　神上十字架，承担本该落在你身上的刑罚。

罪是代替。保罗在总结那改变人生命、在基督教运动最早起点就爆发出来的事情时，第一句话就说到这个——这就是一切基督教信仰“核心中的核心”。

我本可以继续讲下去，但需要在这里稍作停顿：正因为这对基督教如此核心、如此重要，它也正面冲撞我们文化的许多层面。所有人都是罪人；耶稣基督必须上十字架，承担我们的刑罚，平息（旧词叫“挽回”“赎罪”中的“平息”含义）　神的忿怒，满足　神的忿怒——这些在我们的文化里会在一百个层面引发反感。

因此我想简短处理几个问题，算是收尾。第一，我想回应一种反对意见：认为这是原始、嗜血的观念——耶稣基督上十字架代替我们。第二，我也想向你说明：这其实是最民主、最平等主义的教义。

先说第一点。有人指控：耶稣基督必须流血才能满足　神的刑罚与忿怒，这太不可思议了。这就像古代原始、异教、可怕的宗教——满是鲜血、满是献祭。J.I. 帕克在他那本伟大的《认识　神》中有一章处理这个主题，并举了一个完美例子，说明人们想到“原始异教嗜血宗教”时在想什么。

他谈到荷马的《伊利亚特》。你们中有些人可能六年级时学过。希腊军队乘船去特洛伊——因为帕里斯王子把海伦带走了。希腊联军的统帅阿伽门农发现他们无法启航。为什么？因为逆风。因为诸神不知为何对他们发怒。

于是阿伽门农把他的女儿叫来，举行仪式把她宰杀为祭，安抚敌对的诸神。旧词叫“propitiation”（平息/挽回）。他平息诸神的忿怒，然后他们才能驶向特洛伊。

顺便说一句，如果你六年级学这个，他们可能把这一段删掉了。我当年读原著时发现这段，就想：他们为什么不把最好看的部分讲给我听？

于是人们说：“看吧！这里有一个父亲，为了安抚诸神、平息他们的忿怒，牺牲了自己的女儿、自己的孩子。这太可怕了。基督教也是一样：原始、嗜血。”

帕克说：“不，不但不是那样，而且完全相反。”为什么？他说：在异教中，是人去平息他的神明；宗教就成了一种买卖，甚至是一种贿赂。但在基督教里，是　神借着祂自己出于爱的献祭行动来平息祂自己的忿怒。

你看，　神在耶稣基督里来，承担祂自己的刑罚，这与古代原始嗜血宗教完全不同——恰恰相反。别这么说。

第二，我要说这“代替”的教义其实极其平等、极其民主。你可能会说这很奇怪。我想让你看福音陈述一开始的那个小词：保罗说“基督为我们的罪死了”。

那里有一个世界的意义。保罗没有说“为你们的罪”。保罗是“希伯来人中的希伯来人”。他告诉我们他曾是多么严谨、敬虔、宗教性极强的人：他细读圣经，想找出圣经说我们该做的一切，然后竭尽所能遵行　神律法的每个方面。

然而他在这里说什么？他说耶稣基督代替我们，为“我们的罪”死——意思是我也该死；我的记录也该死。

若你觉得这难以理解，你需要读《罗马书》1、2、3章。保罗在那三章里做了一个高层次总结：他用一章谈论外邦人——那些不信圣经的人，他们不遵守圣经关于贞洁、纯洁、正直等规则。

但随后他转向相信圣经的人，指出：尽管他们外在顺服圣经，内心动机却不是爱　神，而是爱自己。里面的自义其实是骄傲。

到了第三章他总结说：“因为世人都犯了罪，亏缺了　神的荣耀。”又说：“没有义人，连一个也没有；没有人真正寻求　神。”这是惊人的陈述。

保罗在说：那些我一生被教导要鄙视的人——外邦人，那些我甚至不愿与之同席的人，因为他们不洁、不遵守圣经——那些我一直轻看的人，如今我却与他们共度余生，我的一生都在他们中间。

为什么？因为我们其实没有本质差别。他说：“我并不比那些割人喉咙抢钱的罪犯更好。”当然，我们迷失的方式不同；我们违背　神律法的方式不同；我们没有尽心、尽性、尽力爱　神、爱邻舍如同自己，各有各的方式。

因此我们同样是罪人，同样失丧，同样需要　神的恩典。这是最激进的平等、最能使人恢复人性的人类教义。

看看保罗：是什么把他从一个自义的种族主义者，变成一个拥抱万民、视众人为同等的人？是福音使他人性化。

因为其他宗教和哲学都说：“你必须做这些才能得救；你必须做这些才能找到　神；你必须做这些才能拯救世界；你必须做这些才能成为好人、道德的人。”于是总会有一群人没有做你认为该做的事，你就会说：“看，他们没有做。”

但保罗说：这不重要。自由派或保守派，道德或不道德，前卫或体面，这个种族或那个种族——都不重要。我们都是罪人，都需要恩典。多么使人恢复人性的教义，多么平等的教义。

为什么？因为我们每个人都是这个世界问题的一部分。你无法把问题都推到“别人”身上。在我所知道的几乎所有哲学、政治纲领、宗教里，基本论调都是：“我们知道该做什么，而那边那些人才是世界的问题。”

但保罗说：“不，不，不。我们都是问题。”

阿加莎·克里斯蒂的小说《东方快车谋杀案》里，她的侦探波洛被困在一列因大雪而停摆的火车上，有人被谋杀。他要找出凶手是谁。车上还有十二位乘客：到底是谁杀的？

这是他遇到过最难的一案，因为所有线索都指向不同方向。他意识到自己漏掉了关键：是什么洞见能把一切串起来？

答案出人意料——我就告诉你。如果有人抱怨剧透，我只想说：这本书已经出版八十年了；你若还没读或没看，我不想听抱怨。

关键洞见是：每个人都参与了。十二个人一起杀了那人。突然一切都说得通了：他们全都是恶人，全都是凶手，全都牵涉其中。

这就是福音给你的线索；没有这线索，你的人生无法解释，社会无法解释，历史也无法解释。我们全都牵涉其中。没有义人，连一个也没有。

这是最民主、最平等的教义。

好，现在第三点。福音陈述的第三部分最长，但不一定表示它比其他更重要。在某种意义上它之所以长，可能因为它在铺垫：本章余下部分将对“复活”的教义作一段漫长、精彩、非凡的论述，因为这正是哥林多教会的问题。

重点是：福音的第三部分关乎历史与复活。他说：“基督照着圣经所说为罪死了；祂被埋葬了；又照着圣经所说第三天复活了；并且显给矶法看（就是彼得），再显给十二使徒看；之后显给五百多人看，多数仍然在世；又显给雅各看；再显给众使徒看；末了显给我看。”他几乎是在说：好像主得特地回来走一趟，因为我像生错了时代的人；但祂也向我显现。

他在谈什么？复活。

为什么耶稣基督的复活在福音中如此重要？因为复活对我们的过去与未来的救恩都至关重要：它确据并保证我们的过去救恩；也确据并保证我们的未来救恩。

先说过去救恩：你怎么知道耶稣在十字架上确实为罪付清了代价？你怎么知道祂确实胜过了罪？你怎么知道刑罚已经被担当？你怎么知道都付清了——以至于若你信祂，就不再有定罪？

在古代，如果一个人欠债，他要么为奴，要么被关在监里。你能确定债已付清的唯一方式，就是看他被释放、被放出来。那时你才知道债已经付了。

罪的工价乃是死。耶稣基督从死里被释放，冲破死亡的捆绑，这就是付清的证据。

如果你在商店里购物，袋子里装着你已经买过的东西，没有什么比穿便衣的人走过来说“你真的买了吗？让我看看袋子里是什么”更令人不舒服、也更令人恼火的。你会很烦、很难堪，但你会怎么做？你会伸手拿出什么？收据，然后说：“别再烦我了。”你会说：“走开。”为什么？因为这证明指控毫无根据。

作为基督徒，你知道怎样用复活来做这件事吗？你学会了吗？当你的良心追着你不放——你失败了，你做了很糟的事，压得你喘不过气——你是基督徒吗？你信了耶稣基督吗？你的良心在控告你。

你知道怎样把复活拿出来，对你的良心说：“别再烦我了。走开。这是我的收据。这证明已经付清。这在历史上印下‘全额付清’的印章，没有人会看不见。”你会这样做吗？

所以一方面，复活确据并保障你的过去救恩；另一方面，它也确据并保障未来救恩，因为我们的未来救恩不只是被赦免、上天堂做灵魂；我们的未来是复活的身体、新天新地、一个没有痛苦和死亡的地方。

那会是什么样？托尔金在一篇文章《论童话故事》中试着解释：为什么我们如此喜爱童话、科幻或所谓的奇幻故事。我们一再阅读、观看；年复一年把它们拍成大片。那里有魔法，有幻想。

他想明白：尤其在现代——我们很世俗，很科学，我们知道这些故事是虚构——为什么我们仍然涌进电影院、读这些书，并且被深深打动。

他说：因为这些故事向我们展示我们无法停止渴望的东西。它们描绘我们所向往、无法不向往的事。

他列出几样：第一，我们渴望能走出时间。能够站在时间之外的概念令我们着迷。第二，我们渴望逃离死亡。第三，我们渴望没有离别的爱——不会终止的爱。第四，我们向往与非人类的存在交流。最后，我们渴望邪恶被最终击败。

因此当我们看到这样的故事，它们就抓住我们；我们永远看不够，因为它挠到了我们发痒的地方——我们对这些事有不可思议的渴望。

但你知道吗？如果耶稣基督的复活真的发生了，并且你信祂，这些事将会字面意义上成为现实——字面意义上。

而且如果你对基督教持怀疑，你可以怀疑，但你为什么不希望这是真的？如果你不希望这是真的，你其实对自己不诚实。

基督教不只是应许它，基本上是展示它——用复活来证明它。

所以保罗才会这样细数：祂向矶法显现，向十二使徒显现，向五百人显现，大多数仍在世。

理查德·鲍克汉姆在他那本很棒的《耶稣与目击者》中指出：这些其实是“脚注”。如果你今天写严肃的学术著作，尤其是历史著作，你必须有脚注。为什么？因为脚注基本上在说：“你如何能查证我说的是真的。”

比如你说“在某年某月某地发生了某事”，你会在脚注里注明某个档案、某个图书馆里原始信件所在之处等等。

脚注就是告诉读者：我说的是真的，而这脚注是你可以查证的来源。

但在当时，如果你写的不是传说而是历史，你怎么做脚注？你会说：“这里有仍然活着的见证人，他们亲眼看见了；你可以去问。”这些就是脚注，这些就是来源。

保罗在说：有几百人用自己的眼睛看见了耶稣。你可以去找他们谈。大多数还活着。现在离事情发生只有二十年。

这意味着什么？保罗在说：复活不是象征，不是好听的故事，不是后来一代代传下来的传奇。人真的看见了祂；有证据。

若真是这样，那么你生命里最深的渴望、你最向往的那种世界，是可得的，是存在的。信福音吧。

最后结尾这一段，从技术上说是见证，十分美丽。因为福音最终是个人性的，不只是几个要点。他说：“我原是使徒中最小的，不配称为使徒，因为我从前逼迫　神的教会。然而我今日成了何等人，是蒙　神的恩才成的；并且祂所赐我的恩不是徒然的。不，我比众人更劳苦；其实不是我，乃是　神的恩与我同在。”

注意三件事。

第一，福音关乎恩典。你看他三次使用这个词：恩典、恩典、恩典。这也是劳埃德-琼斯可以用那个诊断性问题的原因：若人说“我努力、我很努力”，他就知道那人不明白基督教核心，因为他不明白恩典。

他们基本上在说：“如果我够努力，也许　神就会祝福我。”唉。你知道约翰·班扬——写《天路历程》的那位——在自传《恩典丰盛》里讲了一个故事，关于他大概如何信主。

他读圣经却越读越内疚。但他说有一天，他突然想到一句话——一句话：“你的义在天上。”他解释说，当他用信心的眼睛把圣经里读到的东西连在一起时，他“看见”基督坐在　神右边，突然他明白了：那里就是我的义。

　神不可能问：“你今天的义在哪里？”因为我的义一直就在祂面前。我的好心情不能让我的义更好；我的坏心情也不能让我的义更糟。

我的义就是耶稣基督——昨日、今日、直到永远都是一样。于是我的锁链真的脱落了。我觉得自己从罪疚和惧怕的奴役中得了释放；我也看见，我心里那些软弱的品格问题，就像一个富人兜里装着的几枚便士——因为他的产业安全地放在家里的箱子里。

恩典——直到“恩典那枚便士”落下去，你就还没有福音。

第二，然而恩典并不意味着“好吧，你被接纳了，就这样，不改变你”。当然它改变你。因为他说：“祂的恩在我身上不是徒然的。”这真是年度最轻描淡写的一句话。

他其实在说：我曾恨基督教；他没说的是：我也很聪明。保罗是世界历史上最有影响力的人之一。他聪明，并且恨基督教，然而恩典改变了他。

恩典怎么改变你？因为恩典是“不配得”的：你一旦知道这是不配得的，就会被谦卑；但你也知道恩典是“无条件的”，因为它不配得，因此它把你压下去——“我并不比任何人更好”；但因为它无条件，它又把你扶起来——“我永远被接纳，永远被爱”。于是有平安，有胆量。

并且因为它是“昂贵的”：对你来说完全免费，但对祂来说无限昂贵，因为十字架上祂所经历的一切，于是它使你成为一个愿意为他人牺牲的爱者。

“不是徒然的。”

第三，它使你充满惊奇。你看他几乎在对自己感到惊讶：他看着自己说：“然而我今日成了何等人，是蒙　神的恩才成的。”

凯西这周跟我说，《纽约时报》周二的科学版提到：我们可能正处在找到丙型肝炎治疗方法的边缘。顺便说一句，这种病夺走的人比艾滋病还多；它在夺走你生命的同时也让你活得很痛苦。

报道谨慎地说并非确定，但看起来不仅可能有疫苗，甚至可能有药片——只是一粒药片，甚至不是疫苗——你吃了它，几个月内就能把病毒从身体里清除。

当然，听到这消息的人会怎样？他们会兴奋、会惊叹、会彼此转告、会奔走相告。你当然会这样。

想想看：知道那原本悬在你头上的死刑被撤销了，那喜乐何等大。你难道不会告诉每个人吗？你难道不会惊奇吗？

但听着，福音远超过这个。这里不是把你的寿命延长几年而已。这里是“没有离别的爱”、逃离死亡、与非人类存在交流、你曾渴望的一切。

你怎么可能不充满喜乐？你怎么可能不想告诉人？

我们祷告：我们在天上的父，我们感谢你赐下福音，感谢你赐下这喜乐的好消息。我们祈求：福音的“不配得”、它的“无条件”、它的“昂贵”，能像改变保罗那样改变我们——谦卑我们、坚固我们、融化我们、使我们柔软、使我们恢复人性。

父啊，赦免我们没有按福音配得的方式行事——这意味着我们没有去思想，没有去思想，直到福音的能力开始改变我们。

也求你教导我们，怎样温柔地告诉人：我们找到了治愈之方。奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。

---

照着圣经所说，祂为我们的罪死了；祂被埋葬了；又照着圣经所说，第三天复活了；并且向矶法显现，然后向十二使徒显现。此后，祂又同时向五百多位弟兄姊妹显现，其中大多数如今还活着，不过也有些已经睡了。然后祂向雅各显现，再向众使徒显现；最后，也向我显现，像向一个未到产期而生的人一样。因为我在使徒中原是最小的，不配称为使徒，因为我从前逼迫神的教会。然而我今日成了何等人，是蒙神的恩才成的；并且祂所赐给我的恩不是徒然的。

不，我比众使徒格外劳苦；其实不是我，乃是神的恩与我同在。无论是我，是他们，我们就是这样传，你们也就是这样信的。读经到此结束。所以我们要用几个星期来查考一个主题：公共信仰。把你最深的信念、你是谁，在公共场合与别人谈论，这意味着什么？那些人可能并不认同你的信仰；而你又该如何以一种透明、诚实的方式去做？

同时也要尊重别人；要促进和平。这是多元社会中的每一个人都关心、也需要学习怎样去做的事。我们每个星期都在看这个。今天，你来到也许是你必须谈论的、比较显而易见的一件事。

如果我们要讨论这个主题，就必须谈到这一点：基督教的核心信念到底是什么。你不能在公共场合谈论基督教，除非在某个时候你深入到说：那么，它到底是什么？基督徒所相信的核心内容是什么？你要成为基督徒，需要相信什么？

如果你要这样做，整本圣经里没有比这里更好的地方了。当然，圣经里还有别的地方，但这一段有其特殊地位。你看，刚才读给你们听的这段经文里，保罗说：弟兄姊妹们，我要提醒你们我传给你们的福音；你们也领受了；你们也靠着这福音得救；我自己也是领受了，并且传给了你们；这是最重要的；在最末尾，他

他说，所以无论是“更高的他们”，也就是其他使徒，都是这样——这就是我们所传的，也是你们所信的。他给你的不只是一次福音陈述。

他在说：这就是我传给你们的福音。我领受了它。你们相信了它。它拯救了你们。但他也在《哥林多前书》里说话，而学者之间有一种惊人的共识：哥林多前书写成于耶稣基督死后仅仅二十年左右，它或许是我们在新约中所拥有的所有文献里最早的一批。

如果是这样，那么当保罗谈到“这就是我以前所做的”时，他说：还记得我先前来的时候吗？我现在给你们的是我所领受、也传给你们、你们所信并使你们得救的福音摘要——他所说的是在耶稣去世后没过几年就发生的事。所以，如果你想追溯到根基：基督教到底是什么？基督教相信什么？作为基督徒、并拥有属灵生命，你必须相信的、不可再削减的核心是什么？就在这里，就在这一段。

而之所以在公开场合谈论这些时要牢记这一点，是因为如果你是基督徒，就非常重要的是抓住要紧的要紧事。基督徒相信的东西有很多，不同基督教传统所相信的东西也有很多；其中有些可能非常真实、也非常贴近你的心，但你真的不该一味强调、推动并谈论那些许多其他基督徒甚至都不认同的信念。你应该抓住要紧的要紧事，并把要紧事讲清楚。如果你对基督教持怀疑态度，同样也至关重要的是先弄明白基督教究竟是什么。多年来，人们跟我谈他们为何怀疑、他们真的不信；我就问他们：那么，你认为基督教教导什么？

他们告诉我之后，我就尽可能温和地指出：那并不是基督教所教导的。我通常会说类似这样的话：我不知道全世界有任何一间教会会相信那个。当然，我会尽量用友善的语气来说，但因为我会用这个

我一开始用了一个比喻，我意识到，那样说不太温柔，是不是？不，也许我不该那样表达，但问题是：你真的理解你自以为在拒绝的那个基督教吗？大卫·马丁·劳埃德-琼斯，伟大的英国传道人，有一个他常常问人的问题，他认为这是一个诊断性的问题。

这是个很简单的问题。他会说：你认为自己是基督徒吗？对方会说，是或不是。他就说：那么，为什么？如果一个人说：你为什么觉得我是基督徒？我觉得我在努力按照圣经的教导生活。我非常努力地活得像基督。

我非常努力地降服，像他一样。劳埃德-琼斯博士说，如果有人给出这样的回答，他就知道，尽管这非常非常典型，非常典型，但那个人其实并不真正明白福音，不明白核心教导。这就是福音。它是什么？

好，我们就直接往下说。其实这里面有四个部分。福音是关于耶稣的；关于罪与代替的；关于历史与复活的。

也关于那令人惊讶、带来改变的恩典。我们就逐一来看。好，首先，它是关于耶稣的，因为你看，“我当日所领受又传给你们的，乃是最重要的”，他一开始概括福音，就说：“基督……”其实，整段话里其他所有内容，都只是一些从句或短语，用来解释“基督”。它们都指向基督。福音其实就是基督。

福音就是耶稣基督。怎么会这样呢？“福音”这个词，很多人知道它的意思是喜乐的消息。这在希腊文里技术上确实如此。它其实是用来宣告一件会改变历史的事件的。

这个词的意思通常是用来宣布诸如新王的加冕、击败入侵的军队之类的事，像那样的重大消息事件。若这就是核心——若基督教教导的核心是“福音”——那么我们立刻就会面对：是什么使基督教与其他一切……不同。

宗教。你看，所有宗教当然都包含关于其创始人的叙事。所有宗教都会讲故事，会有关于其创始人生平的叙述。但他们的创始人——所有其他宗教的创始人——是老师，不是救主。

正因为他们是老师而不是救主，他们的生平故事就不是那些宗教“核心中的核心”。那些宗教“核心中的核心”，比如伊斯兰教的五功，或佛教通向觉悟的八正道，那些宗教“核心中的核心”总是一套关于你必须做什么的指引。既然创始人是老师，那些宗教“核心中的核心”就是一套关于你必须做什么的指引。但基督教“核心中的核心”是福音。那不是一套关于你必须做什么的指引。

它是对已经成就之事的记述。它其实不是劝告。基督教不是关于你必须做什么的建议。它是消息。是关于他已经做了什么的消息。

事实上，这整段经文里最引人注目的一点之一是：从第三节一直到末尾，这段对福音的描述里，没有任何关于你必须做什么的内容。其实，这里的福音甚至不包含“你必须悔改并信”。当然，你必须悔改并相信福音；若要在你的生命里发挥功效，他在第二节上面也这么说：他说你们领受了，并且靠它站立得住。但你看，从严格意义上说，那是对福音的回应。

它并不是福音本身的一部分。为什么？因为福音是：你能做的、你将要做的、你曾经做过的任何事，都不能成为你在神面前被接纳的基础。一切都归结为耶稣基督所做的。你所做的、你能做的、你将要做的、你做的任何事，都不能成为你在神面前被接纳的基础。

一切都归结为耶稣基督所做的。因此，甚至悔改和相信，从技术意义上说也不是福音的一部分；那是对福音的回应。当然，福音会给你的生命带来巨大的改变。它使你成为世界上促成和好、公义与爱的行动者。它深刻地

改变你的品格。

它改变你身份的根本结构。它改变你内心的路径。它改变你心的运作方式。然而，这些都是福音所带来的结果。你从来找不到圣经的作者。

你也从来找不到使徒或保罗把这些塞进福音里，好像这是福音的一部分。不。从某种意义上说，福音就是耶稣基督，就是耶稣。所以首先，它是关于基督的。

其次，它也关乎罪与代替。好，那么耶稣所做的第一件事是什么……哦，我们被告知关于耶稣的事。这里说，基督为我们的罪死了。为我们的罪而死。

最先提到的是：罪与代替。首先，是罪。我们被告知耶稣来要做什么的第一件事，就是处理罪。我们无知，需要智慧。是的。

我们是受苦的人，我们需要帮助。我们需要扶持。我们需要解脱。是的。但是，我们在这里学到的是，首先，我们是需要拯救的罪人。

也就是说，罪是我们最根本的人类问题。我知道这需要一点解释。你会说，为什么是这样？嗯，首先，罪意味着：如果神创造了你，并且确实有一位创造你的神，并且他每一秒都托住你，使你得以维系在一起——你可能会说是重力。

好吧，那么重力从哪里来？或者说，是那种……是那种你知道的，电子能围绕原子核运行的方式。是什么让这一切维持在一起？你每一秒都被神托住。

如果确实有一位创造你并且托住你的神，他做了这一切，那么你就欠他一切。或者说，你欠他的并不是只在遇到麻烦之类的时候才祷告。你欠的是要为他而活，彻底地为他而活。但罪是圣经的教导。当然，你知道这一点。

我们不为他而活。我们不为神而活。我们不为邻舍而活。我们为自己而活。我们倾向于自私地生活。

我们把世界弄坏了。这就是罪。但是，你看，说他为罪而死，就意味着那是我们最根本的问题。其他一切都由此而来，因为我们与我们的造物主隔绝了。而我们需要……

“隔绝”这个词并不……你知道，它并不常用

非常非常。但我希望你明白这有多么重要。我想我可以用一个简单的例子让你看见。罪意味着我们在个人关系上、在法律意义上，都与造我们的主隔绝。

中间有一道障碍。耶稣来就是要处理这件事。在他能做任何别的事之前，他必须先把这件事解决。所以想象一下：你有一个朋友，你们做朋友已经很久了。

后来发生了变化。起初，你注意到你的朋友使用你送给他的东西，却不表示承认，也没有感恩。接着更糟。你发现你的朋友对你撒谎，违背承诺，然后又对你撒谎。最后，事情变得非常可怕。

你的朋友从你那里侵吞钱款，因为你们可能一起做生意。或者干脆就是偷你的、抢你的。所有这一切曝光之后，你的朋友坐下来对你说：哦，我们还能做朋友吗？因为我真的……我会努力做得更好。我会努力活得更好。

我很抱歉。你会怎么说呢？当然，你会用你自己的话来讲，你会用你自己的措辞。但本质上，你会说：嗯，我们处在一种疏离、隔绝的状态里。

这既是法律层面的，也是个人层面的。因为你会说：听着，我知道你道歉了，我想你是道歉了。当然，如果我们还要重新做朋友，如果这种隔绝的状态要消失，你必须为此懊悔。但仅仅“以后做得更好”是不够的。

我们要怎么处理你对我做过的事？你抢夺了，有一笔债，有一宗罪行，坏事已经发生了。

若我们还要重新做朋友，就必须处理这不公。看到了吗？个人与法律。并且当然，在神那里，这一切会被无限放大，因为你得罪的是一位无限的神。于是你就有了无限的债。

你有了无限的罪行。中间有一道障碍。这就是为什么耶稣不能只是作为一位教师而来。因为教师来会说：这是你如何道歉、如何稍微做得更好。但那并没有解决问题。

它没有解决隔绝的问题，对吗？也没有解决那道障碍。耶稣来就是要处理这道障碍。怎么处理？

代替。这个小小的词“为”对我们来说并不怎么显明

因为我们英语里的“for”（F-O-R）这个词，涵盖的含义范围极其广。你必须坐下来思考、反复琢磨，才能明白某件事是在“以什么方式”为另一件事。这里面有各种各样的类别。幸好，希腊语有更多的介词可供使用。

这里用的介词是“huper”，意思是“代表……、为……的缘故、在……的位置上”。也就是“替代”。这句话是在说，耶稣基督是为我们而死；他是替代者；他是代替我们死的。

他承担了我们应得的。换句话说，耶稣基督取代了我们的位置——我们本该在十字架上被弃绝的位置。而如果我们信他，那么我们就得着他本该在父家筵席上所得的位置：蒙爱、作神的儿女。

哥林多后书5章21节：神使那无罪的，替我们成为罪，好叫我们在他里面成为神的义。现在，圣经用许多不同的隐喻，试图描述十字架上发生了什么。有一种是市场的语言。有时它说，耶稣基督在十字架上付了代价。为什么？

因为罪是一种债。我们刚刚谈过。在古时候，如果你欠了债却还不起，你就会沦为奴隶，直到你能偿还为止。而圣经告诉我们，耶稣基督是我们的赎价。

他把我们从奴役中赎出来。他付了代价，于是我们得以自由。所以你有市场的语言，而罪是一种债。还有另一种语言用来讲十字架。

那是战场的语言。你知道为什么吗？因为罪不只是债，不只是法律意义上的欠债，它还是一股强大的邪恶力量。

它在你我里面。它使我们去做我们厌恶的事。这就是保罗在罗马书第7章里说的：我常常发现自己正在做那件我恨恶的事。它把我们吸进自我中心里，用惧怕和各种东西充满我们，使我们去做我们不愿意做的事。

它是一股里面的力量。当然，它也是外面的力量：人可以伤害我们。而耶稣基督来了。圣经在一些地方说，耶稣上十字架，是为要战胜邪恶、罪与死亡的权势。

这是一场可怕的争战。他受尽痛苦。但到最后，他争战并

他为我们赢得胜利。所以这里有市场的语言，有战场的语言。还有法庭的语言。

法庭的语言说，罪也是对某种标准的违背。而如果确实有一位上帝，你希望他反对邪恶和不公，不是吗？你不希望上帝是被动的。你不希望你的上帝只是袖手旁观。你希望他对这件事有所作为。

你希望他在司法上对邪恶和不公发出忿怒。但如果看看我们里面是否也有任何邪恶、任何罪，那么那忿怒、那司法性的忿怒、那定罪就落在我们身上；可是耶稣基督来了，承担了我们本该受的刑罚。现在，尽管这些比喻彼此差异很大，还有别的，还有别的。但所有这些隐喻都很美妙，因为它们展示了人类问题的不同侧面，也展示了我们所拥有的丰盛救恩的不同而奇妙的方面。但你有没有注意到，有一条线贯穿其中？

每一个。替代。

耶稣争战。耶稣付代价。耶稣承担了我们无法承担的。

这就是为什么约翰·斯托得在他所有著作中最精彩的一段里说到这点。他是一位英国圣公会的牧师。他说，“替代”的概念对于理解罪与救恩都至关重要。你若想明白福音，就必须明白替代。因为一方面，什么是罪？

那就是你用自己来替代上帝，把自己放在只有上帝才配在的位置上。你掌管自己的人生，但你并不是自造的。你看，当你说“我要决定我自己人生的一切”，你在说什么？你在说“我是我自己的制造者。我是我自己的创造者。”

当你行事仿佛你是自己的制造者、自己的创造者，而你其实不是，这有点像宇宙级的剽窃，你知道吗？当你把自己放在那个位置上，而且顺便说一句，你严重不够资格去做你生命的主。严重不够资格。你看，罪就是你用自己来替代上帝。那救恩呢？救恩就是上帝用自己来替代你，把自己放在你本该在的位置上。

上帝走上十字架，承担他自己的刑罚。现在，罪是

代替。保罗一开口说的第一件事，就是在概括那件在基督教运动之初、在开端之开端就改变了人生命运的事；在一切基督教信念之核的核心。而是的，尽管我很喜欢滔滔不绝、还想继续讲下去，我还是得先停一下。因为这件事再重要不过，这对基督教来说再核心不过，但它却正面冲撞我们的文化。所有人都是罪人；耶稣基督必须上十字架，替我们承担刑罚，平息——“挽回”是旧译——上帝的忿怒，使上帝的忿怒得到满足；这种观念在我们的文化里会在无数层面让人皱眉。

因此我想简短地处理几个问题，算是把一些零散的尾巴收一收。第一，我想回应一种反对意见：认为这是个原始、嗜血的观念——耶稣基督上十字架、以自己代替我们。第二，我也想向你说明：这其实是最民主、最平等的一种教义。先说第一点，有人指控说：这种说法认为耶稣基督必须流血，才能满足上帝对罪的刑罚与忿怒。许多人说，这实在难以置信。

这就像古代那些原始、异教而可怕的宗教一样——充斥着鲜血和献祭。J.I.巴刻在他那本伟大的书《认识神》（Knowing God）里，有一章专门讨论这个主题。他举了一个绝佳的例子，说明当人们想到原始、异教、嗜血的宗教时，心里指的是什么。

他谈到《伊利亚特》，荷马的《伊利亚特》。在《伊利亚特》中，有些人可能知道，大概从六年级就学过。希腊军队乘船要去特洛伊——记得因为王子帕里斯把海伦带走了。希腊军的统帅，也就是阿伽门农，发现他们无法启航。哦，为什么呢？

因为逆风。因为诸神不知为何对他们发怒了。于是阿伽门农派人把自己的女儿叫来，举行仪式把她宰杀，作为祭物，来安抚那些敌对的神明。旧词叫“挽回”（propitiation）。他挽回了诸神的忿怒，然后他们就能驶向特洛伊。

顺便说一句，如果你在

六年级的时候，他们大概把那一段给省略了。我真正开始读的时候，他们也把那部分对我省略了。我说，你们为什么不告诉我最精彩的内容呢？你知道的。嗯，人们会说，好了，看吧。哎呀。

这里有一个父亲为了讨好诸神、平息他们的愤怒，竟把自己的女儿、自己的孩子献祭了。这太可怕了。然后人们说，基督教也就是这样。它跟那一样原始、嗜血。还有，J.R.

帕克说，不，不。不但不是那样，而且完全不同。为什么？他是这么说的。他说，在异教里，人去安抚他的神。

于是宗教就变成了一种商业行为，甚至是一种贿赂。然而在基督教里，上帝借着他自己出于爱的献祭行动，平息他自己的忿怒。你看，上帝在耶稣基督里来到世上，他去承担、承受他自己的惩罚，这完全不同。它恰恰是古代那种原始、嗜血宗教的反面。别那么说。

其次，我想反过来再谈谈这种“代替性”教义。它在根本上是平等的、民主的。你可能会想，哇，这有点奇怪。我希望你看看这里，在福音陈述一开始保罗说的那个小词：基督为我们的罪死了。你知道这有多有意思吗？

这里面有一个世界的含义。保罗并没有说“为你们的罪”。保罗是“希伯来人中的希伯来人”。保罗告诉我们，他是一个多么谨慎、敬虔的宗教人士。他仔细研读圣经，想找出圣经说我们该做的每一件事。

他竭尽所能遵守上帝律法的每一个细节，凡他能做到的都去做。然而他在这里却说什么？耶稣基督代替了我们，为我们的罪而死——意思是我也该死。我的记录也配得死亡。

如果这在你看来完全无法理解，你就需要去读《罗马书》一、二、三章；在那里，他给出了一个非常高层次的总结。他用一章来谈论异教徒。是的，外邦人，那些不相信圣经的人，他们也不遵守圣经关于贞洁与纯洁的规则，并且……

正直、以及诸如此类。但随后他转向那些相信圣经的人。他指出，尽管从外表看他们在遵守圣经，内里他们的动机却不是出于对上帝的爱，而是出于对自我的爱。

在他们的自义里面，有骄傲。他来到第三章，说：所以，众人都犯了罪，亏缺了上帝的荣耀。他又说：没有义人，连一个也没有。没有人真正寻求上帝。这是多么惊人的宣告。

因为保罗在这里所说的是：那些我一生被教导要鄙视的人——外邦人——那些我甚至不愿与之同席吃饭的人，因为他们是不洁的；他们不遵守圣经。那些我一直鄙视的人，如今我却把我的一生都花在他们当中。我把我的一生都花在他们身上。

为什么？因为我们其实并没有什么不同。他说：我并不比一个割人喉咙、抢人钱财的罪犯更好。归根结底，当然，我们迷失的方式不同；归根结底，我们以不同的方式违背上帝的律法。

归根结底，我们都以不同的方式，未能尽心、尽性、尽力爱上帝，并且爱邻舍如同自己。因此，我们都是同样的罪人。我们同样迷失，同样需要上帝的恩典。这是最彻底平等、最使人得人性的教义。看看保罗。

是什么把他从一个自义的种族主义者变成一个拥抱所有人、把他们当作平等之人的人呢？该说是什么？是福音。福音使他恢复人性。因为其他所有宗教和哲学都说：这是你必须做的，才能得救；这是你必须做的，才能找到上帝。

这是你必须做的，才能拯救世界；这是你必须做的，才能成为一个好人或一个有道德的人。在那种情况下，总会有一群人站在这边，没有去做你认为应该做的事。因此你就不得不说：哦，你看，他们没有做这个。但保罗说：这不重要。

自由派、保守派；道德的、不道德的；你知道，前卫的、体面的；这个种族、那个种族，都无所谓。我们都是罪人。我们都需要恩典。这是多么深刻地使人得人性。

多么

也就是一种彻底的平等主义。你知道为什么吗？因为我们所有人都是这个世界问题的一部分。你没法在——我想我所知道的每一种其他哲学里、每一个我所知道的其他政治纲领里——找到这一点。

我所知道的每一种其他宗教，基本上都在说：我们知道我们应该做什么；而那边那些人才是世界的问题所在。当然，保罗说，不，不，不，不。我们所有人都是问题。你知道，阿加莎·克里斯蒂的小说《东方快车谋杀案》。

里面的侦探波洛被困在一列火车上，火车卡在雪堆里。然后有一个人被谋杀了。他试图弄清楚凶手是谁。而他在火车上同车的还有另外12位乘客。

那么这12个人里，到底是谁杀了人？所以他在设法找出来。而这是他见过最棘手的一案。因为所有线索都指向不同的方向。他意识到自己漏掉了什么。

他漏掉了什么。到底是什么关键洞见能把一切串起来？是什么关键洞见能让一切都说得通？嗯，令人意外的答案——我就告诉你了。要是有人抱怨我剧透，我想让你知道：这本书已经出版80年了。

如果你还没读过、也没看过改编作品，那我可不想听你抱怨。你知道那个关键洞见是什么吗？是所有人都干了。12个人一起把那个人杀了。于是突然之间，一切都说得通了。

他们全都是反派。他们全都是凶手。他们全都有份。好吧，这就是福音给你的线索；没有这个线索，你的人生就不会有意义。

社会不会有意义，历史也不会有意义。我们都在其中。我们都在其中。没有人是义的。

一个也没有。最民主、最平等主义的教义。好，现在第三点。这个福音陈述的第三部分是最长的，但这并不表示它一定比其他部分更重要。从某种意义上说，它之所以长，大概是因为它在铺垫：本章后面的内容将会对复活的教义作一段冗长而美妙、非凡的论述；因为这在哥林多教会是个争议。但重点是，他现在说第三部分是关于

福音是历史，是复活。他说，基督照着圣经所说，为我们的罪死了；也埋葬了。

又照着圣经所说，第三天复活了；并且显给矶法看（就是彼得），然后显给十二使徒看；此后又同时显给五百多位弟兄姊妹看，其中大多数到如今还在；以后显给雅各看，再显给众使徒看；末了也显给我看——他几乎是在说，好像主还得特地回来跑这一趟，因为我仿佛生不逢时似的。但他也向我显现了。现在他在讲什么？复活。

为什么耶稣基督的复活在福音中如此重要？因为复活至关重要——它既关乎我们过去的救恩，也关乎我们将来的救恩。首先，它确据并保证了我们过去的救恩。你怎么知道耶稣在十字架上死，真的付清了罪债？你怎么知道它确实战胜了罪？

你怎么知道刑罚已经被担当？你怎么知道一切都已经付清？以致你若信他，就不再被定罪。你怎么知道？你看，在那些年代，如果一个人欠债，他要么沦为奴隶，要么可能被关进监牢。

你能知道债已经还清的唯一方式——你能确信债已还清的方式——就是当那个人被释放、被放出来的时候。那时你就知道债已经还清了。罪的工价乃是死。而当耶稣基督从死亡中被释放，挣断死亡的捆绑时，这就是债已付清的证据。

这就是债已付清的证据。你在商店里购物，手里提着一个袋子，里面装着你已经买好的东西；没有什么比几个便衣走过来对你说“你真的买了这些吗？让我看看你的袋子里面”更倒霉、更令人不快的了。你很恼火，感觉很糟，但你会怎么做？你会伸手进去拿出什么？

收据。你就说：“别再烦我了。”你说：“走开。”为什么？因为这是证明你的

那项指控毫无根据。你若是基督徒，知道怎样用“复活”来做到这一点吗？

你学会这样做了吗？当你的良心来追讨你——你失败了，你做了一件非常、非常糟糕的事——这事折磨得你快要崩溃。你是基督徒吗？你信了耶稣基督吗？你的良心在控告你、折磨你。

你知道怎样凭着复活脱困，并对你的良心说：“不要再搅扰我。走开。这就是我的收据。这证明那债已经完全付清。这证明在历史上盖上了‘已付清’的印章，以至于没有人会错过它、忽视它。”

你知道怎样这样做吗？所以，一方面，复活使你确信并稳固——你过去的救恩；但另一方面，它也使你确信并稳固未来的救恩，因为我们的未来救恩不只是被赦免，然后作为灵魂去天堂生活。我们的未来是：复活的身体、新天新地、一个没有痛苦与死亡的地方。你知道那将会是什么样子吗？

托尔金在一篇题为《论童话故事》（On Fairy-Stories）的文章里，试图帮助我们理解：为什么我们如此喜爱童话、科幻，或者我们所说的奇幻故事。我们不断阅读它们，观看它们，年复一年把它们拍成卖座大片。那里有魔法，有幻想。

他在试图理解：为什么在这个世界上——尤其是在我们这个现代时代，当我们非常世俗、非常科学，也明知这些故事是虚构的——我们仍然涌进电影院，仍然读那些书，而且还会被深深触动。他说：原因在这里，因为这些故事向我们展示了一些东西；它们描绘出我们所渴望、而且无法停止渴望的事物。以下是其中一些。

他说，我们渴望有能力走出时间之外。能够走出时间之外的想法令我们着迷。第二，我们渴望逃脱死亡。第三，我们渴望不必分离的爱——不会终止的爱。

这还不止于“不必分离的爱”。第四，我们渴望……我们对与非人类存在沟通的想法着迷。最后，他说，我们实际上，当然，渴望有一个

邪恶最终被打败。所以每当我们看到这类故事，它们就会把我们牢牢抓住。

我们永远看不够，因为它正好挠到我们痒处。我们对这些东西有一种不可思议的渴望。但你知道吗？如果耶稣基督的复活真的发生过，并且你信靠祂，那么所有那些事情其实都会在字面意义上成真——真的会成真。你看，如果你对基督教持怀疑态度，好吧，你可以怀疑，但你为什么会不希望这是真的呢？

如果你不希望这是真的，你就是对自己不诚实。而基督教应许这一点——不只是应许；它在本质上把这一点展示出来；它借着复活在本质上证明了这一点。

这就是他为什么要讲这些。为什么他还要继续往下说？他被矶法（Cephas）看见；他被十二使徒看见；他被五百人看见，其中大多数人现在仍然活着。

理查德·鲍克汉（Richard Bauckham）在他那本很棒的书《耶稣与目击者》（Jesus and the Eyewitnesses）里指出：这些其实就是脚注。你看，如果你今天在写一部严肃的学术著作，尤其是历史著作，你必须有脚注。为什么？因为你的脚注基本上是在说：你可以用这些方式来核实我所说的是真的。比如说，如果你写：在某年某月某地，这件事发生了。

那么你就会在脚注里标明：在某个图书馆的某个历史档案登记处里，有原始信件之类的东西。他说，脚注就是一种方式，让你对读者说：我所说的是真的；而脚注所指向的来源，使你可以查证我告诉你的是真实的。但你看，在那个年代，如果你写的不是传说，而是历史，你怎么做“脚注”呢？你会说：这里有仍然活着的见证人，他们亲眼看见了这件事，你可以去核查——这就是脚注。

这些就是来源。保罗是在说：有成百上千的人亲眼看见了耶稣。你去跟他们谈。大多数人仍然活着。到这个时候不过才二十年。

你明白这意味着什么吗？保罗是在说：复活不是一个象征。它不是一个温馨的故事。它不是一个传说。它不是在漫长岁月中一路流传到我们这里的虚构。

人们看见了

他。有证据在那儿。如果真是这样，那么你在生命中最渴望的东西、你最渴望的那种世界，是可以得到的。它就在那里。相信福音。

你看，在最最末尾。这个结尾严格来说是一段见证，非常精彩。因为你知道，福音归根到底是个人性的。它不只是几条要点式的子弹清单。他说：“我原是使徒中最小的，不配称为使徒，因为我从前逼迫　神的教会。

然而，我今日成了何等人，是蒙　神的恩才成的；并且他所赐我的恩不是徒然的。不，我比众使徒格外劳苦；这原不是我，乃是　神的恩与我同在。”你看这三件事，正如我们刚才所说。

首先，这是关于恩典的福音。注意，他三次使用这个词。福音是关于恩典、恩典、恩典。之所以马丁·劳埃德-琼斯（Lloyd-Jones）可以用那个诊断性问题去问人：“你是基督徒吗？”如果他们回答：“嗯，我在努力、很努力地尝试。”他之所以立刻知道他们没有明白基督信仰的核心，是因为他们不明白“恩典”。

他们基本上是在说：“嗯，如果我足够努力，那么也许　神就会赐福我。”天哪。你知道吗？约翰·班扬（John Bunyan）——写了《天路历程》的人——在他的自传《恩典丰溢：致罪魁》（Grace Abounding to the Truth, to the chief of sinners）里，讲了一个他大概是如何归信的故事。他一直在读圣经，可那只让他更有罪疚感。但他说，有一天，他突然想到一件事。

他在书里说，有一天，当我穿过一片田地时，忽然我想到一句话，一句话：“你的义在天上。”他解释说，后来他就凭着信心的眼睛，把他在圣经里读到的东西串联起来。他说：“凭着信心的眼睛，我看见基督坐在　神的右边；我忽然明白——那就是我的义。　神不可能问：‘你今天的义在哪里？’因为它一直就在他面前。我的良好心境不能使我的义变得更好；我的糟糕心境也不能使我的义变得更坏。

我的义就是耶稣基督——昨日、今日、直到永远都是一样。于是，我的锁链真的就脱落了。我

我感到自己从罪疚和恐惧的奴役中被拯救出来。我看见，我心里那些软弱的性格特质，就像一个富人揣在口袋里的几枚便士，而他的财富目标却安稳地锁在家里的箱子里。要恩典，得恩典，直到“恩典的便士”在你心里啪地一声落下、你真正恍然大悟；否则你还没有抓住福音。其次，然而，恩典并不意味着：好吧，你就是被接纳了。

事情并非只有这样，它并不会改变你——当然会改变你，因为他怎么说？“他赐给我的恩典不是徒然的。”哎呀，这简直是年度最轻描淡写的一句话。因为他的意思是：我曾经恨基督教；他没说出来的是：而且我是个极其出色的人。要知道，保罗是世界历史上最有影响力的人物之一。

他才华横溢，却憎恨基督教，然而恩典改变了他。那么恩典怎样改变你呢？因为恩典是不配得的——一旦你意识到神的恩典是你不配得的，它就使你谦卑。但当你也意识到恩典是无条件的：正因为它是不配得的，它把你压低——我并不比任何人更好；但也正因为它是无条件的，它又把你扶起来。

我总是被接纳，我总是被爱——平安、胆量；并且因为它是有代价的，所以对你而言它完全是免费的：神的恩典。但对他而言却是无限昂贵的，因为他在十字架上必须经历那些。它把你变成一个愿意为他人舍己的爱人。“不是徒然的”，不是徒然的。最后，它让你满心惊奇。

你看，他几乎是在……我觉得他对自己都感到惊讶。他就看着自己说：“然而我今日成了何等人，是蒙神的恩才成的。”当你说这句话、当你——你知道，凯西这周提醒我，《纽约时报》周二的科学版谈到一个事实：我们大概正处在找到丙型肝炎（hep C）治愈方法的边缘。这种病顺便说一句，夺走的人比艾滋病还多。它在杀死你的同时，还让你过着极其痛苦的生活。而现在看起来也许——他们特意强调并不确定——但看起来不仅可能有疫苗，甚至可能有一种药片，就是一片药，不是疫苗，
你服下去，就能在几天之内把它从你体内清除掉。

几个月。

当然，所有听到这消息的人都会兴奋不已；他们震惊、惊叹、赞美，彼此转告，奔走相告。你当然也会这样。你当然会这样想：想想那份喜乐——原本悬在你头上的死刑判决被撤销了。你难道不会把这事告诉所有人吗？你难道不会惊叹吗？

但你听着，福音远不止如此。我们说的不只是把你的寿命延长几年。我们说的是爱而不别离，是从死亡中得逃脱，是与非人类的存在相通。我们说的是你曾经渴望的一切。你怎么可能不满心喜乐？

你怎么可能不想告诉人：这是借着祷告？

我们在天上的父，我们感谢你赐下福音。我们感谢你福音那喜乐的好消息。我们求你使它那“不配得”的性质、那无条件的性质、那付上代价的性质，像它改变保罗一样改变我们——使我们谦卑，使我们得能力，融化我们，使我们柔软，使我们更有人性。

哦，父啊，赦免我们没有行事为人配得过福音；这意味着我们只是没有在想——没有在想，直到它的能力开始改变我们。

也求你教导我们，如何以恳切、吸引人的方式告诉人：我们找到了医治的良方。我们奉耶稣的名祷告。阿们。
