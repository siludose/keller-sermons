Welcome to gospel in life.  Who is Jesus?  The Bible says He's fully God, the creator of the universe, and at the same time, fully  human.  Lose one of those and you lose Christianity.  Join us for today's podcast where Tim Keller explores the person and promises of Jesus  Christ.  Every January and June, the pastors get together and we do a short series together on some  theme or subject.  And what we're doing here in the month of January, and actually, if you want to see  how the subject's divided and how all the assignments have been divvied out, you can  find that on the very back page of the bullet and tells you what we're doing in January.  After speaking about, we're talking about how to understand Jesus.  Now that means that somebody might say, but aren't you always talking about how to understand  Jesus?  And the answer is every so often, it's a good idea to give people a helicopter ride in  a comprehensive way a look at the biblical doctrine of Christ.  The biblical doctrine of Christ means a look at all the various facets of what the Bible  teaches about Jesus.  The Bible teaches us about Jesus person.  He is human and he's divine.  And in the Scott last week, in the morning evening service dealt with that.  And it's very, very important, as certain points, to take a look at the two sides of what  the Bible teaches about Christ's percentage.  Because if you only see him as human and not divine or only see him as divine and not human,  you get into some tremendous trouble and you have a distortion of what it's not Christianity,  whatever you come up with, it's not Christianity unless you keep that together.  And the Bible, besides teaching those two great things about his person, the Bible teaches  three great things about his work.  All of the things the Bible tells us that he has done, fit into three basic categories.  He's a prophet, he's a priest, and he's a king.  And it behooves us to spend a month in which we basically take a survey of those three  aspects of his work.  Now let me just put the whole thing in context for you for a moment.  When I say that there's three things, everything that Jesus does, everything that he says  or does anywhere in the Bible can fall into one of those three categories.  And those categories are used because they are so crucial.  If you leave out any one of those three things, if you see him as two of those and not the  third, if you see him as one of those and not the third, it gives you a distortion.  It distorts your view of reality.  It certainly gives you a concoction that's not Christianity and it's spiritually poisonous  if you take it into your system.  Let me just give you a couple of examples.  There's plenty of people, when we say prophet, priest, and king, by prophet, we mean he's  a revealer.  He communicates truth.  He's the revealer of God.  Who God is and what his will is, is a prophet.  And secondly, he's a priest.  That means he's a redeemer.  He's a representative that is he comes to stand in our place.  You see, as a prophet, he comes actually representing God, but as a priest, he represents us.  As a prophet, he comes and speaks to you and me for God.  But as a priest, he comes and speaks to God the Father for us.  He's our stand in.  He died in our place.  You see, he brings us to God.  He's our advocate.  He's our representative.  He's our redeemer.  So first, he's a prophet, revealer.  Secondly, he's a priest, redeemer.  And thirdly, he's a king, a ruler.  He commands us.  We owe him our utmost allegiance.  He's the supreme authority in our lives.  So there he is, prophet, priest, and king, revealer, redeemer, and ruler.  Now, let me just show you what happens if you leave any of them out.  There are plenty of people that I have run into in New York.  And I've been thinking a lot about this because I've been reading a book.  I'll refer to it again.  It's called New York in the 50s by Dan Wakefield, who was a Columbia University student in the  early 50s and stayed in Grant Village, and became part of the beat generation in the Bohemian  scene.  You know, it was a writer, and anyway, one of the things that I have noticed, I was reading  the book, and I realized that I've met so many people who've come to New York City from  Middle America.  And out in Middle America, they had, in many cases, fairly orthodox kind of Christian upbringing.  But they come to New York, and they completely leave it behind.  They disdain the religion of their childhood along with the values of Middle-class  American, the values of the great homogeneous American, they dive into the intellectual  and cultural and ethnic diversity of New York, and they think of themselves as kind of  a superior race now to where they've come from.  And very often I'll talk to these folks, and you know who you are.  And what they'll say is, you know, I don't go to church, and I pretty much have lived  the way I feel like I should be living, and I don't know what I believe anymore, really.  But I know this, that when I was a little girl, when I was a little boy, I made a decision  for Christ, and I still somehow believe that he's really for me.  I really somehow believe he's still with me.  In other words, I've come here, and my feelings and my experience and my emotions are now  my king, and they also are my prophet.  In other words, I bring my own truth, I decide what truth was true for me, and I decide  how to live.  But I still want the idea somehow of a Jesus who's a redeemer.  I don't want him as a king, and I don't want him as a prophet.  I don't want him to tell me what's true, and I don't want him to give me any commands.  But somehow, I just like the idea that he loves me, and he forgives me, and he's always  with me.  All right?  That's not Christianity.  That's something, but it's not Christianity.  You can't have Jesus with only as priest and not prophet or king.  Only as a redeemer and not a revealer and ruler.  I'm Timothy James Keller, and if somebody says to me, come in, James, stay out, Timothy,  and Keller.  I'll be in a pickle.  I won't say, well, you know, I'm sort of a whole thing.  I don't know what part of me is the James part, and maybe it's my left arm.  Maybe you can have that.  It doesn't work that way.  I'm all Timothy.  I'm all James.  I'm all Keller.  And he's all prophet and all priest and all king.  He just can't have one piece of him.  All right, let me, another example, but I'll be more brief, is there are plenty of groups.  And I guess I'd say churches, but there's plenty of groups that love the idea of Jesus.  They've really got a very developed view of Jesus as the king and the commander.  But their understanding of him as being a redeemer, their understanding of him as being an advocate  is very underdeveloped.  And in those legalistic groups, you know, you're hit over the head with Jesus says, and  Jesus says, and Jesus says, it's very vivid.  It's put across in a very imaginative and vivid way, but any discussion about his redemption  and about his grace and about his love is all an abstraction.  Jesus is king.  Without Jesus as prophet and priest is a terrible, terrible place to be.  However, it's not really Jesus.  Or now, one more example, just as the legalistic groups like him as king and not as a priest  and just as like licentious people like him as priest, but they don't like the idea of him as king or revealer.  So there's an awful lot of folks today.  They didn't actually like the idea of Jesus as a prophet, but not as a priest in a king.  In other words, they say, I believe Jesus was a great teacher.  I believe he revealed to us a great deal about God.  But I just can't buy in this whole idea of him being a divine savior, a divine king, and so on.  Now, one of the most famous, I'll just refer to it here, one of the most famous passages in all of modern Christian literature  has got to be that chapter in Mayor Christianity where C.S. Lewis points out that that's the one thing you can't believe  that he's only a prophet.  He says the problem with this prophet was that Jesus Christ, the prophet, came and he said,  I'm God.  You have to worship me.  I alone can forgive your sins.  What you think of me will determine where you spend eternity.  So this man comes along with all these unbelievable claims.  The saying that he's God and saying that he's got to be the final authority in your life and so on,  and you are the stone on which he's the stone on which you will either rise or fall and so forth.  So Lewis says something very obvious.  He says, if this is true that he claimed all these things, then he's either much more than a prophet or much less than a prophet,  but he can't just be a prophet.  Either he's far more than a prophet because he claimed to be or else, he's crazy or he's a liar and he's a fool  and he's much less than a prophet, either he's more than a prophet or else we can't believe anything that he says.  But the one thing he will not allow you to believe is that he's only a prophet and not a priest in a king.  Don't you see, if you try to hold on to one, if you either have one or two and reject the others,  or if you even just have a grasp on one and a kind of vague understanding of the others,  it will introduce distortions into your life.  In fact, in fact, I think that it would be possible, though I don't think I can go into it right now.  It would be possible for me to create a grid, for myself as a pastor to help people understand what's wrong with their Christian lives.  I'm talking about Christians here.  I think in most cases, if we look at our Christian lives and we say, what's wrong, where do we need to grow?  Where do we have stress fractures in our Christian life?  Where is there crumbling, where is there deterioration, where is there weakness?  Ordinarily, you'll be able to do it by looking at this grid.  Very often, we're really good. We have a good grasp on Jesus as one of these things and on Jesus as one of the others.  Some of you are really great into the Bible study.  The idea of Jesus' prophets great.  You love to study his teachings, and you know very, very well,  and yet you're not being obedient to him as king.  Some of you are being very, very obedient to him as king, and yet you're just full of guilt and anxiety  and burdened and you're burdened down with a horrible view of yourselves,  because you just really don't have a good grasp of Jesus as redeemer and priest.  Don't just say, you know, these three things,  that's why we're spending a couple of weeks on each, a couple of sermons on each.  He's the prophet, he's the priest, he's the king.  Now, having said that, and I just sort of set the context for the entire month,  tonight, I would like to say, even though he's far more than a prophet, he is a prophet,  and what does that mean?  Let me read, believe it or not, have a scripture text, yes.  Let me read from Acts chapter three, verse 17 to 26.  Now, I just gave you the introduction to the month.  Now, Acts chapter three, verse 17 to 26,  read it, and there's two basic things that we want to draw out of this,  that tells you something about Jesus as the great and ultimate prophet and revealer of God to us.  In Acts three, it reads, start in verse 17, this is Peter preaching.  He says, now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance as did your leaders,  but this is how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets,  saying that his Christ would suffer, repent then, and turn to God,  so that your sins may be wiped out, and that times of refreshing may come from the Lord,  and that he may send the Christ, who has been appointed for you, even Jesus.  He must remain in heaven until the time comes for God to restore everything,  as he promised long ago through his holy prophets.  For G-Moses said, the Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me  from among your own people. You must listen to everything he tells you.  Anyone who does not listen to him will be completely cut off from among his people.  Indeed, all the prophets from Samuel on, as many as have spoken, have foretold these days,  and you are heirs of the prophets and of the covenant God made with your fathers.  He said to Abraham, though your offspring through your offspring,  all peoples on earth will be blessed, and when God raised up his servant,  he sent him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways.  Now, what do we see here? First of all, we see the obvious, and that is that Jesus Christ is a  prophet. It says, Peter says, Moses had prophesied, the Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet  like unto me, said Moses. From among your own people, you must listen to everything he tells you.  Anyone who does not listen to him will be completely cut off.  Now, what Moses is saying is, you think I was a good prophet, there is a prophet to come  to beat all prophets. He will be like me, and yet he will be so supreme in his authority,  so seminal in his authority and his truth, that your relation to him  will completely determine whether or not you're accepted or cut off.  So, and Peter says, this is Jesus. Jesus is the one who's coming.  And, you know, what does it teach us? All right, first of all, the fact that Jesus is a prophet,  not just a priest in a king, but a prophet, shows us that we have a God who speaks to us.  Now, I want you to know that ever, ever since, the beginning of time, it seems like  human beings have wanted desperately to have a universe to talk to them, to have a universe to  talk back to them. If you read our literature and you look at our songs from the very beginning,  we have been always imagining talking trees and talking animals. And even in our science fiction,  we imagine other races, you know, from other planets, we're desperately afraid of the idea that  maybe we're the only speakers in the world. But maybe it's an impersonal and silent universe.  Maybe at bottom there's nobody to talk to. There's no rational, there's no rational other.  And the Bible says that's not true. The reason you believe that there is, the reason you want  so desperately to have someone else to talk to is because there is. One of the things I loved  about Leonard Bernstein was he said, you know, I don't believe the Bible, I don't believe that  sort of thing. And yet, remember, he says, when I listen to Beethoven, remember the great quote,  I don't, that's why I'm reading it. He says, when I listen to Beethoven, he says, Beethoven  leaves us with a feeling that something is right in the world, that something checks  throughout, that something follows its own laws consistently, something we can trust,  something that will never let us down. In other words, he says, you know, I don't believe in  absolute truth. I don't believe an internal body of truth that's internally coherent,  that's absolutely consistent to its own inner laws, that's something that we can trust that will  never let us down, that checks throughout. And yet, when I hear Beethoven, I feel like it must  exist. And the Bible says, the reason that you want to believe in talking trees, the reason you  want to believe there's a universe out there to talk to you, there's a rational center that can  talk back to us is because there is. The reason that you, even when you intellectually, say,  I reject the whole idea of absolute truth, I reject the idea of a guy who speaks to us,  when I talk, when I listen to Beethoven, I know how that there's something else,  that we're not all alone, rational in an irrational universe, personal in an impersonal  universe, speakers in a silent universe. I can't believe that. Well, the Bible says the reason  you can't believe it, the reason that you want to believe it, where did you get the idea? It's  because it's true, because you know it, because there is a God who speaks, and he speaks to Jesus,  when Jesus was transfigured, remember the transfiguration on the mount of transfiguration,  the apostles who were there saw Jesus, and they saw Moses on the one side, and Elijah on the  other, prophets, and Jesus standing in the middle. And a voice came down from heaven, remember what it  said? This is my son, says God, hear ye him. Hear ye him. You cannot relate to Jesus Christ as  some kind of mystical figure. He is a teacher, he is a prophet, he brings truth, and you have to  your relationship with the Father is through a prophet, and that means that your relationship with  God is not just a mystical kind of oneness, it is a relationship based on communication and an  acceptance of that communication. It's rational, it's orderly, there's a body of truth that this  prophet brings, and that's the basis of your relationship. You can't just commune with God by going  out into beautiful spots, you know, of nature, and just kind of feeling his presence. That's not  the way you relate to God as a Father. This is my beloved son, hear ye him. He's a prophet. Now,  the two things I just like to talk about, just the two aspects, is what it means, what a prophet is,  anyway, what does the Bible mean when it talks about prophets? So first of all, what are prophets,  and then secondly, why is Jesus the ultimate prophet? Why is he the final? I'll show you, the  Bible teaches, he's the final prophet. That's a big difference between Christianity and other religions.  Islam will tell you Jesus was a prophet, but they will not grant that he was the final prophet.  And there's a lot of other religions that will say Jesus was a prophet, but they will not grant  that he was the final prophet. That's the place where Christianity diverges from others.  They say that Jesus Christ reveals God in an unsurpassable way and brings a disclosure of God  that can't be topped. And here's the reasons why. But anyway, let's take a look, these two things.  What are prophets? What does the Bible teach us about prophets and why is Jesus the ultimate prophet?  Number one, what are prophets? You see, it says in the word is mentioned a number of times in the  passage. Jesus is the prophet that Moses was talking about, but it also tells us a great deal about  what prophets did. Look, in verse 18, if you have something to look at, it says, this is how God  fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets. Now you see, if you want to know what a  prophet is, a prophet is a mouthpiece for God. God foretold these things through the prophets,  doesn't say the prophets foretold. Sometimes it does, but it tells us that whatever the prophet says is  what God says. Now if you want the best definition, biblical definition of prophecy and what a  prophet is, you can go back to an interesting place where Moses is being told by God to go and speak  to Pharaoh. And Moses says, you don't understand. I'm very inarticulate. I don't like crowds. I get scared  when I get up on a platform. I can't take it. So what does God say? He says, fine. Aaron's better than  it, you know, it's speaking to you. So he says, quote, this is an Exodus 7, I will make you like God  to Pharaoh and Aaron, like a prophet to you. So whatever you say, Aaron will say.  See, now modern people don't believe what the Bible says about prophecy. Modern people will say,  okay, here are the prophets and they have written what the Bible says, the prophets have written,  there's Isaiah and here's Hosea and here's Obadaya and here's all these prophets. Well, how do we  regard them? We say those are men who have interpreted, they have interpreted, they're giving us  their interpretation of who God is. And that's great. We might learn from them, but of course,  we all have the right to make our own interpretations about what God has said too. And so the idea is  sort of like this. Let's just say Shostakovich has written a new symphony, but I don't think he can,  isn't he dead? But anyway, but let's just say he has, he's dead, or if he's not dead, he's certainly  probably not writing any symphonies anymore. So you are a critic for the paper and you go  to hear this symphony and you listen and you're all done, you sit down, you write your column and  you say, well, you know, I think that the first, I think that the first movement is a man in bondage,  yes, a man in slavery. And I think the second movement is a man in liberation, a man liberating  himself from bondage. And so you write this down and so on. And that's how many people say we  should understand prophets. Prophets are people who wrote in the Bible like Isaiah and Hosea and  people like that. And they wrote down their interpretation. They say, well, I think God is like this  and I think God is like that. Well, everybody has a right to their own interpretation, right?  However, what if you ask Shostakovich to write the review of his symphony for the paper?  And you said, Mr. Shostakovich, tell us, what were you trying to say in the first movement?  What were you trying to say in the second movement? And he writes it down. And you see,  that's a very different thing than when the critic interprets it. Here you have the author saying  something and it kind of gets rid of the whole idea. You know, if you're, how can you debate  what Shostakovich had in his mind when he wrote the first movement of that symphony? You can't debate  it over. We have it right from his mouth now. Do we understand when the prophets  write something in the Bible? Should we understand it as a critic interpreting what the composer  meant? Or do we interpret really as nothing more than the very ideas and words of the composer  simply through the mouthpiece of the prophet? And the Bible says very clearly, it says, especially  in 2 Peter, chapter 1, verse 13, no prophecy of Scripture is by the prophet's own interpretation,  but prophets spoke from God not of their own will as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. Period.  You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger brother.  In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who try to  earn his love by being good. In his book The prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known  story reveals the heart of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother  and the judgmental older brother, and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal,  extravagant grace. Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith,  The prodigal God will help you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way.  The prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the  hope and joy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the world.

Now I know, one reason I'm putting this out, we have to bring this up every so often.  This idea of truth is utterly repugnant to the modern mind, and we're modern people and we live  in a modern community, maybe the most modern city anywhere. And yet that's what it means when  the Bible says Jesus was a prophet, and that's what it means when it says the Bible is a word of  prophecy. Prophets are simply bringing you the very words of God. That's why it says there in verse  he foretold through the prophets. What the prophets say? God says. And therefore the idea of truth  is in Christianity is this is objective truth. This is not an interpretation of what God thinks.  This is what God thinks. It's possible to know what God thinks. Well, I tell you, it's so easy for  for people to say the idea that you can know what God thinks. Who do you think you are?  Christians are often told this. You think you know what God thinks. Who do you think you are?  And the only thing you can say at some point is yes, I do believe that our God is knowable.  I do believe that our God speaks. I do believe that our God is not a hidden God.  I do believe that our God is not hiding from us. You do. That's the difference.  It's not a matter of pride. I think you can know what God thinks about certain things.  Because I believe there's a God who speaks. Not just the God who's out there, not just the God who's  out there, but a God who speaks. Now, Christians will always find when they come to understand this view  of prophetic truth that that God has spoken, that God gives us objective truth.  You're going to find that there's two very different alternate worldviews really competing  with Christianity in a city like New York. Every so often, you know, I mention these two  basic competing worldviews and unfortunately, every time I give them different names, so a lot of you  probably think there's seven or eight. But the two of them are, you know, let me give you all  the different names. The one is sometimes people, sometimes we call it naturalism because it's the  view that nature is all there is. Sometimes we call it secularism that says, you know, there's nothing,  there's no spirit, there's no supernatural. All we have is what is matter. All that's all.  And on the other hand, besides naturalism or secular scientism, you've got pantheism.  Pantheism, which means God is in everything. I also sometimes call it new ageism.  Confuses everybody. And they seem very different. The one view says there is no God.  Nothing is God. The other view says everything is God. God is a force in all of us.  And therefore, the first view says there's really no truth, only facts. We know scientific facts,  but there's no truth. There's no reality. You see, there's no ultimate reality. Bertrand Russell  says, when the universe dies, all the civilization will go. So there's no right and wrong. There is  no spirit. There is no purpose or meaning in life. And he says, only if you build your life  on the knowledge of that. Only if you build your life on, he says, the foundations of unhealing  despair will you be safe. Don't believe any humbug about there being meaning. Don't believe  any humbug that there's right and wrong. We're just made of molecules, period. That's the one view.  The other view says, oh, no, God is in everything. In fact, you are God. And what it says is,  we have to alter our consciousness, move into a new state of consciousness, and look inside of  ourselves to get in touch with our own greatness, our own potential, our own creativity.  Now, they sound very different and very often they hate each other and they have fights on  cable television. They fight with each other. You see, the one group, you know, one group it believes,  it's funny. The one group believes nothing and the other group believes everything.  The one group believes in nothing and the other group says, what, to row cards, you know, crystal balls,  channeling, you know, and you know, worshiping nature, yeah, yeah, you know, everything.  One group believes in nothing, one group believes in everything. One group says there is no God,  one group says everything is God. And they seem very different. But here's where they  in practice, in practice, it comes out of the same thing. They both come down to this. You are  your own truth finder. You are your own truth bringer.  On the one hand, you see a Bertrand Russell will say, you decide how you want to live. There's no  right and wrong. On the other side, they say, well, you have to look into yourself and find out  what you really are and who you really are. But when it comes right down to it, in both cases,  there's no truth outside that we have to submit to. You're your own truth finder, you're your own  truth bringer. And I, listen, the one view sounds so noble. You know, they say to us, they say to  Christians, yes, if you need a belief in God to face the meaninglessness and despair of life, well,  okay, you know, you, they seem, it seems so noble. It seems so, you know, they seem so strong  and courageous. On the other hand, the pantheistic, the new ageistic people, they seem so exotic.  So positive, so profound, you see. But I would suggest that there are some very crass motives  that people have to reject the Christian idea of truth because at the very bottom, there is a  childish side of us that doesn't want anybody to tell us what to do. And as intellectual and as  noble and as positive as profound as it sounds, it plays right into those crass motives, right into  the hands of those crass motives. The book I was reading by Dan Wakefield called New York in the  50s. Dan Wakefield was a guy from the Midwest and he came to Columbia University and he started  reading the existentialist and he began to realize that the universe was a cosmos was meaningless  and that existence was absurd and everybody had to find their own truth, you know. And so he went  down into the village and he began to live any old way he wanted. And he said, you know, he would  get his friends would come from Indiana. One time he had a woman come from Indiana and they spent  a couple weeks with him and said, she says, Danny, New York is so intellectual. New York is so  sophisticated, so anonymous, I don't know what's in to commit first. And he said, you know, really  what New York gave us was an intellectual construct to justify doing all the things our parents  back in Indiana would never let us do. And so people, a lot of people say, oh, you know,  Christians, you've got motives for wanting to believe in Christ. You've got motives for wanting  to believe that the Bible is really the word of God. You want authority in your life. You want  certainty in your life. Yeah, sure. That's true. So there's motives there. What about your motives  for rejecting the concept of truth? You see, you've got tremendous motives. People come,  especially college kids, they just love either to buy into naturalism or pantheism. Why? Because now  I can do all the things my parents would never let me do. Finally, I can do whatever I want.  There's nothing more crash in that and there's nothing more childish than that.  Put it this way, your eight year old comes home having played baseball. And he says to you, boy,  I got into kind of a fight. Why, honey? Well, I was rounding third and this boy tripped me.  Well, what did you do? I got up, I grabbed a big rock and I threw it as hard as I could  write it as head and it just missed him. He got very upset and we had a fight. So you say,  son, that was absolutely and totally wrong. What he did was wrong, but what you did, you could have  killed him. It was disproportionate. It was all out of proportion. It was wrong, always wrong.  It's how you're going to ruin your life if you have a contemporary like that. You're going to  ruin your life if you think you can respond like that. So what does your son say? You weren't there.  You don't know. Who do you think you are to tell me what to do? I mean, that's the way the heart works,  you see. That's the essence of the heart. So what do you say to the kid? You say, I'm 40, you're eight.  I am from above. You are from below. I can see things that you can't see. Absolutely serious.  I know it's funny. It is funny. You can laugh, but it's totally serious. You say to the kid,  I can see life from a vantage point that you can't even imagine. And therefore, unless you hear  my word, if you reject my word, your life will be a wreck. In John chapter 8, Jesus says, I am  the light of the world and everything that I say is true. And if you reject my truth, you will  die in your sins. And it says here, what does it say? It says, the Lord your God will raise up for  you a prophet, but this prophet will be different than all other prophets. This prophet will not be from  below. This prophet will be from above. And because he's from above, if you don't listen to him,  you will be completely cut off. So what are we saying? The first point, and there's only two points.  Don't worry. The first point, the Bible says that there is objective truth, that Jesus Christ  brings it, but all the prophets brought it. Now we're going to see in a minute why Jesus Christ is  the ultimate bringer of truth, but the prophets bring a truth which trumps all other sources of  information. See, the other worldviews hate that idea. They say, well, we're all on competition.  Oh, Isaiah, they have an interpretation of God, but so does Shakespeare, so does my English teacher,  so do I. Everybody has their own interpretation. The Bible says, no, there are some people who have  spoken that are prophets, and they bring a truth which is from above. And therefore that truth  trumps all other truth, all other source of information. You've got your heart motions, right?  You've got expert opinion, you've got your traditions that you were raised in, and you've got public  opinion. Jesus' truth, God's truth trumps all other kinds of truth. If it differs with public  opinion, you have to follow it. If it differs with your feelings, you have to follow it. That's the  nature of truth. That's the nature of, that's what it means when the Bible says that there are  prophets, that God has sent prophets, though you've murdered the prophets, when I sent them to you,  he says, I will keep sending them to you because they bring the truth. You don't like the idea of  a truth that trumps you, but it does. Now, one more thing about this. I know that what I said  sounds very harsh. The doctrine of God's truth, the idea of God's truth, the Bible gives us,  it's hard, it's unyielding, it's got sharp edges to it, it's like chewing on a diamond,  I know that. And yet, what about Beethoven? We hate the idea that there is truth that no matter  how much we want to do this, we're not allowed. That no matter how much we don't want to do this,  we have to. That idea, we just hate it. That's why we love to jump into the existentialists. We  love to jump into the New Age, we love to jump into complete skepticism about any truth at all,  you see. We just love that idea. We hate the idea of it being a prophet. I know it sounds very  harsh, but what are you going to do about Beethoven? Because you see, Pascal puts it this way,  just as we have an incapacity for proving anything which no amount of dogmatism can overcome.  Hear that? He says, on the one hand, we really can't prove anything. Nobody can prove anything.  He says, on the one hand, we have an incapacity for proving anything which no amount of dogmatism  can overcome yet. He says, we have a concept of the truth which no amount of skepticism can overcome.  What I'm trying to say is, you look at the people, and maybe I know some of you are these people.  Look at the people who say, ah, there is no truth, like Bertrand Russell. And look at the people  who say, well, truth is found within. Look at the people who say there's no such thing as objective  truth. And yet, every human being, every human being has a concept of truth that no amount of  skepticism can overcome. We all know that some things are right or wrong regardless of what people  believed. Isn't that right? Some things are just wrong, we say. But if you don't believe in a God  who speaks through the prophets, you've got no basis for that. You've got no basis for believing it.  And you can't help but believe it. You know there's a truth. You know there's a God who speaks.  Okay. So first, we learn that God speaks through the prophets. But lastly, we also learn in this  passage that Jesus is the ultimate prophet. He's the final revealer of the truth. Why? You see,  notice, even though he's a prophet, it tells us that he is what all the prophets were speaking of.  It says, this is how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, saying his  Christ would suffer. Repent then and turn to God so that your sins may be wiped out. In other words,  Jesus Christ is not only the subject of prophecy. He's the object of prophecy. He not only brings  the truth, but he is the truth to which all the prophets have always been pointing. And that means  what makes him different and all your prophets is simple. He is not just the one who brings the truth.  He is the truth. Buddha, Mohammed, and Moses, and Abraham, all of them come and here's what they  say. They say, don't look at me. I am pointing to God. I'm pointing to the way to God. Don't look at me.  So I am nothing in myself. I am pointing to him. Jesus is the first prophet who comes along saying,  I am pointing to me. You can only find God through me. I am the way, the truth, the life. No one  comes to the Father, but by me. And it says in Hebrews chapter 1, verse 1, it's astonishing thing.  It says, in the past, God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets in many times and in many ways.  But now he has spoken to us by his son, who is the radiance of God's glory and the exact  representation of his being. That's just, you know, there is no parallel for such a statement.  It says, why all other prophets, what they told us was piecemeal, every other prophet who has  ever lived. In fact, I could even go so far and say, every other prophet of any other religion  comes and tells us true things. You know, they would never have gotten off the ground. I'm not  saying, Muhammad says plenty of true things. Buddhist is plenty of true things. They have to,  you know, you do not get a religion off the ground unless there's a lot of truth in it, an awful lot.  But Jesus is the only one who comes not saying pointing over his shoulder but pointing to his own  heart. He's the one that comes and says, they can tell you a lot about God, but I can show you God.  So I am the ultimate revealer. Why? Because all other prophets give us pieces of the truth in many  ways and many places we heard, but now God has spoken in this final way. Why is it unsurpassed?  Because he is the very radiance of his glory and the exact representation of his being.  And that's the reason why we have to say, how could anyone come after Jesus and add anything?  How could he? Unless there's a fourth person to the Trinity and then it wouldn't be a Trinity,  you see? No, there are been prophets, you know, Muhammad came along afterwards that Jesus is a  prophet, but I trump him. I'm the ultimate. I bring a higher view. I bring a better view.  Baha'u'la said the same thing. People have been doing it all the 20th century.  The only way you could really get away with that rationally is to say, I am God. In fact,  I'm a better, I'm a bigger, I'm a better manifestation of the radiance of God's glory,  and I'm a more exact representation of his being than Jesus. Nobody has ever dared make such a claim  except people who are lunatics. Why? You can't get away with it unless you are a heck of a moral,  glorious character. You better be unbelievably great person. Your wisdom and your beauty and  your attractiveness and your compassion and your absolute consistency. Only Jesus has ever been  able to claim that and get away with it because only Jesus had the life to match his claim. And  therefore, he is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being.  And let me conclude by saying, he is not just a prophet because as God, he shows us who God is  because he's so compassionate and loving in the way in which he talks and acts and moves.  No, ultimately, Jesus is the ultimate revealer. Well, this is what's so great about why you can't  move Prophet Priest and King away from each other. He is the ultimate prophet because he's the priest  and the king. On the cross, listen. Other prophets have told us, haven't they? That God is holy.  Other prophets have told us, haven't they? That God is love.  Prophets, in all religions, have come and said, God is holy. He is just. He hates evil. He hates sin,  right? And all the prophets have come and said, God is loving. God is compassionate. And Jesus  was no different. He came and he said, God hates sin. He also came and said, God loves you.  And he told the parable, the prodigal son. And he showed how when we come back to God, the father  is so eager to have us back that he comes rushing to us before we can even get half of our repentance  out of our mouth. He leaps on us and he kisses our neck. Now, Jesus, like a prophet, told us those  things. But Jesus, because he's a priest, is the ultimate prophet, because on the cross, he shows  in a way that no prophet ever has or ever could. He reveals in a way that no prophet ever has or  ever could. The absolute glory of God, because he reconciles the holiness and love of God on the cross.  The one place in history, the one place in the universe, where the holiness and the love of God  shine out with equal brightness is on the cross. Because when you understand the logic of the cross,  Jesus died for you. So the more God poured out his wrath on sin, the more he saved us.  On the cross and only on the cross, God is both just and justifier of those who believe.  Only there is God's heart, his essence revealed. Only the true glory of God. There is no other  religion. There is no other prophet. There's no other place anywhere that shows us that like that.  Why? Because you say Jesus is more than a prophet. And that's why he's the ultimate prophet.  And I tell you that if you follow any other prophet and make any other prophet supreme, any other  source of truth supreme over Jesus, you will either see the holiness of God or the love of God,  but you'll never see them together. Never. You'll either be either a legalistic person or lie  sensuous person. You will be an unbalanced person, but you'll never hold it all together.  You'll never see how they, the righteousness and the love of God, kiss and embrace and weep and  fall on each other's neck, so that God can weep and fall on your neck. Only this prophet says to  the woman caught in adultery, I don't condemn thee, but yet he says go and send no more. How can he  do both? The cross. Only he do here do we have God, God who is just and justifier. It's  unsurpassed. It's unbelievable. Look into the face of this prophet. Look into the face of this  God, of this of this prophet, Jesus Christ, and you will see the face of the Father.  Is he? Listen, Jesus says, this is my beloved son, here ye him. Let me ask you to conclude.  Do you? Do you just hope that Jesus will kind of love you, but you don't want to study his teaching,  master his teaching? You really don't like the idea that he has the right to tell you what to do?  I tell you something. Do you want him to redeem you? Do you want him to love you?  Do you want him to open away to the Father? You have to hear him. You have to listen to him.  You've got to let his hard, unyielding objective truth into your life. Are you willing to do that?  Because he's all of these things or he's none of these things, but because he's all of these things,  he shows us the Father. He's the absolute representation, exact representation of his being  and the radiance of his glory. Let's pray. Father, we thank you that all this is for us,  we thank you that because Jesus Christ came and died, you can look at our sin and yet fall on our  neck and say, put on my robe, put on my ring, let's kill the fatted calf, let's dance and sing  for your mind, your home. Father, when we see Jesus Christ and only when we see Jesus Christ,  are we able to really see you, only he reveals you, only he does. Thank you for the uniqueness,  thank you for the supremacy of his revelation of your being and of your radiance and of your glory.  We pray that tonight, the two things we might learn is that we need to study the Bible,  we need to study, here's the scripture, we need to know it inside out.  But on the other hand, that your son, Jesus Christ, is the supreme and ultimate prophet  and his truth trumps all of the truths and the picture that he gives us of you is the supreme  picture that's possible. We thank you for this great disclosure and we ask that you would help  us to take it in to our own lives and be changed by it. No one knows the Father except the Son  and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him. In Jesus name we pray, amen.  Thanks for listening to Tim Keller and the Gospel and Life podcast.
