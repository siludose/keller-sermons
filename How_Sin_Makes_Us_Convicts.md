## English Transcript / 英文原文

today, more and more, we believe in a loving and good God who's more accepting of  people. And that's the gist of it. I don't know. I was there. I mean, I had that in eighth  grade, ninth grade.

But here's what I'm going to say, the biblical and three God, the angry  God that's presented to us by the Bible. Yeah, we have lost, but yet we have lost connection  with it in our society and our culture. And I'm here to tell you, it's a bad thing. In fact,  I'll go this far. You need an angry God.

You need in your mind and in your heart a God  that gets angry at sin. You need an angry God to live with hope. You need an angry God  to live with humility and you need an angry God to know how loved you are. And if you don't  believe in an angry God, a really angry God who hates sin and is going to punish it,  you're impoverishing yourself. You're taking away all sorts of hope and humility and love.

That's what I'm here to tell you. And you know, you say, how does that work out? Well, okay,  let's go. First of all, and basically you just work right through the text on this. First of all,  verses one to three tell us that you need an angry God, the biblical angry God, to live in hope.

To be able to live in hope in a broken world. One of the things that's easy to miss when you  studies these books like Aziz, in fact, big parts of the Old Testament, is that they have a historical  situation. They were not just written as essays. They weren't lectures. They were written  into a historical situation.

And everybody agrees that Isaiah chapter 40 and following after chapter  40 was written to a nation to Israel that was facing exile, that was facing tremendous injustice,  that was going to face or did face or had faced when they read this. Their capital city drew  some torn down. Their own children slaughtered. Go read about it in Psalm 137. Their infants,  their little heads of their infant stashed against the rock by the victors.

Captivity,  chains, terrible injustice. And so what are they doing? Well, we see in verses one to three,  they're asking God to come down and judge the injustice. They're saying, oh, well,  you would run the heavens and come down. The mountains would tremble before you.

As when fire sets, twigs of blaze come down to make your name known to your enemies and cause  the nations to quake. And what they're really saying is, if you came down with all your justice and  you went after the oppressors and you went after the perpetrators of injustice, they would be like  dust before you. They would crumble. They would be like burning twigs that the wind drives away. And so they're saying, of course, this is what verses one to three sang.

How in the world could  you possibly live in a world filled with injustice with any hope at all, unless you believed in a  and angry God? God gets angry in injustice. And so here's the first point. First point is the  God's anger in the Bible is not like our anger usually is. It's not crankiness.

It's not ill  temper. It's not ego. It's not it's not explosion. It's not out of control. It's a settled, fixed,  implacable, irrevocable, incorruptible, opposition to injustice and evil.

So that,  no debt will go unpaid. Every account will be squared and nobody will get away with anything. And that's what the Bible means when it says there's an angry God. That's the kind of God  that we have. That's what the Bible presents.

Now right away, objection. I know. Right away,  people immediately put up their hands and say, wait a minute. One of the problems with that,  one of the reasons why many people, most people in New York City certainly believe that that's a  primitive idea is they say, you know what? This idea of a God of vengeance.

Oh my, it's primitive. We've got to get beyond that because we need to work for a peaceful world. This idea of a vengeful  God who bears the sword. Oh my work. That leads to intolerance and eventually the violence.

What you really need is you need to believe in an accepting God if you're going to believe in a God. You have to believe that sin is in the eye of the beholder. You have to believe that sin is sort of  a matter of perspective. This idea of a God of vengeance. That's going to lead to nothing but  violence.

Nothing but intolerance and violence. Well recently I read a book that is one of the most  powerful refutations of that extremely common belief that we have to get beyond a God of vengeance  if we're going to have a world of peace. Incredible book actually. In many ways, it's a book by  written by Miroslav Wolf, whose Croatian and the name of the book is exclusion and embrace. And let me read you his thesis.

He says in this book, because his Croatian, he was raised in  the former Yugoslavia, he has seen all the stuff the people who this passage was written to,  who are crying out for vengeance and crying out because of the injustice. He's seen all that. He's been through that. And this is what he says. The practice of nonviolence requires a belief  in divine vengeance.

I'll say that again because it just, I mean, if nobody's eyebrows are raised,  you're not listening. The practice of, there we go, that's better. The practice of nonviolence  requires a belief in divine vengeance. He says, the only way to nonviolence is to believe in a God  who gets angry at injustice. Without an angry God, you'll never get out.

You'll never get into  nonviolence. You'll be stuck in the cycle of violence. Now, how does he make that point? Well,  here it is. Here's the quote.

And he says, my thesis that the practice of nonviolence requires a  belief in divine vengeance will be unpopular with many Christians, especially in the West. But to the person inclined to dismiss it, please imagine something. Imagine you're delivering  a lecture in a war zone where I delivered this chapter as a paper. And among your listeners are  people whose cities and villages have first been plundered, then burned, and then leveled to the ground,  whose daughters and sisters have been raped, and whose fathers and brothers have had their  throat slit. Now, the topic of your lecture is a Christian attitude toward violence,  and the thesis is we should not retaliate and be sucked into the cycle of continued violence.

We should not pay back. Why not? And here's what he says, violence thrives today, secretly nourished  by the belief that God refuses to take the sword. And then he says, if you do this, if you lecture  like this, soon you will discover that it takes the quiet of a suburb for the birth of the thesis. The human nonviolence is the result of a God who refuses to judge.

And a scorch man soaked in  the blood of innocent, of the innocent, the idea will invariably die like other pleasant  captivity of a liberal mind. In a world of violence, it would not be worthy of God not to wield the  sword. If God were not angry at injustice and deception, did not take a final end of violence,  that guy would not be worthy of our worship. Now, can I put it in a nutshell? Here's what he's saying.

Anybody who says that a God of vengeance will lead to violence has not actually been a victim  of violence themselves. You live in a nice suburban little bubble, or a very, very nice area where  you haven't yourself been the victim of injustice. He says, when you're the victim of injustice,  you will have to pay back unless you're assured that there is a God of vengeance, that there is a  God who hates injustice, that there's a God who's angry with injustice. And a God who's going to settle  every account so that nobody gets away with anything, unless you believe in a God of divine vengeance,  you will not be able to resist picking up the sword and being, you know, being the avenger yourself,  or else you'll just die at a spare. That's the reason why he's able to come back and say it's  the practice of non-violence that absolutely requires a belief in divine vengeance.

And so here's  our first point. You know, people say, why do I need an angry God? He says non-violence is impossible  without belief in a judge. In fact, let me, let me, let me go, let me press a little further. If  you are, what he calls the victim of one of these liberal piety's, you've always heard of,  I believe in a God of justice, that would not lead to peace in the world.

That would lead to more  violence. He says, you will be absolutely, if anybody ever comes and actually does something bad to  you, you will be sucked right into pay back. Actually, you've been already. He just haven't had,  maybe in many cases, you haven't had actually, somebody actually attack you and draw blood or kill  you or kill, or kill people in that your family. And anybody tried to do that.

He says, because  unless you believe in a God of vengeance, you will not be a peacemaker. You will not be able to  live a life of peace in the world. You will not be able to live a life of hope in the world. In fact, one thing that worries about me, if I look out at it, many of you, many of you do live in  that bubble because most of us live in a world far more safe and far more happy and far more secure  than most other people who have lived anywhere else in the world or anywhere in any other time in  history. And if that bubble should break and you have a nambi-pambi God who does not wreak  vengeance on injustice, you will either get sucked into the violence you will have to pay back yourself  or else.

You'll die in despair. That's the first thing. You need a God. You need an angry God  where you won't be able to live in peace in an unjust world. Secondly, you need an angry God  if you're going to live in humility.

Now, here's what's so intriguing. Let's move right on to the  next three verses. All the commentators say it is extremely interesting to see the ironic  relationship between the first and second stanza, the first stanza is verses one to three. We just  read it. What they're saying is, we are the victims of injustice.

And so we call down into the world  the God of judgment. If you would only come down and make the mountains shake, what would happen? Well, the enemies, the wicked people, the enemies, the bad nations, what they would do is they  would just, they would be consumed. They would become dust. They'd become consumed.

And they would,  the wind would blow them away. But get this. See, before you, verse two, the nations would quake  before you. But now look, verses four, five, and six, here's the great irony. Who's tripling up now?

Who is wasting away? See, who is tripling up like a leaf, verse six? And like the wind, our sins sweep us away. They are. The very thing they call God down  to do is happening to them.

And this is what we were saying. And this is, at this point, by the way,  this is an extremely important little test to know whether or not you're understanding the difference  between the angry God that maybe you were taught about, or you taught other people, maybe  somebody taught you about this as you were growing up, or maybe you were taught other people  believed in an angry God. And the angry God of the Bible, when you meet the angry God of the  Bible, you will find out and you will come to see what they see. You'll get out of verses one to  three. When you're in one to three, what you're thinking is if God would come down, the bad people  would be judged.

But in verses four to six, they find out that we deserve as much judgment as  anybody else, that we too are under judgment, that we too absolutely deserve punishment as much  as those people that we thought were the wicked perpetrators. That's absolutely critical,  and this is one of the great tests to know whether or not you're getting in touch with the  biblical God. Let me show you what I mean. There's two kinds of people in the world that seem to  be opposites. There's two kinds of people in the world, those who divide everybody in the world,  in the two kinds of people, and those who don't.

Did you know that? Well, I meant there's two  groups of people that are very prominent. I wouldn't say there's only two kinds of people here. On the one hand, you've got people we would call religious people, traditionally religious. And they certainly believe that there are absolute standards, and that there are absolute moral values,  and that we're going to be judged by them.

And therefore they believe that if God were to come down,  He would judge the bad people. And people who are religious, they say, well, I don't cheat on my  spouse, and I go to my family, and I obey the Ten Commandments, and I go to church, or synagogue,  and I give to the poor, and so on. I'm a good person. And so you're in versus one to three. You say,  if God were to come down, you see, the bad people would be judged, and they feel pretty good about  themselves.

On the other hand, you've got their nemesis. I mean, in our society, the nemesis,  so that people believe in traditional moral values, are, you might call this secular people,  progressive liberal people, and what they say is, you know what? Everybody,  sin is in the eye of the beholder. Everybody's got their own way of defining sin. What sinful for  you wouldn't be sinful for me, and what we have to do is we have to embrace them.

We have to embrace  everybody. We have to tolerate everybody. We have to accept everybody. And they look very, very  tolerant, except they're just as much in versus one and three. Because what they are saying is,  yes, you know, what the trouble with this world is, is all those people over there who are in tolerant.

I'm not like them. You see, they're religious people, and they're religious people,  are all walking around saying, if only everybody in the world was like me, we wouldn't be in trouble. If only those people over there that are causing the trouble, if somebody would just knock them down. And so you see, it really doesn't matter whether you're religious or religious, whether you're  conservative or liberal, if you live in versus one, two, and three. But what happens to Christians?

When they finally get close and to see what God really is like, inevitably, what they say is,  verse six, all of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are filthy  rags. Now that is a stunning statement. In fact, you know, when you first read through it, you say,  wait, what? He didn't say all our sins are his filthy rags. Of course, they're filthy rags.

All our righteous, and he's not just saying righteousness is just a sort of a general thing,  our righteous deeds are filthy rags. What happens is a Christian has begun to look past the  externals into his or her own heart. Start looking at motivations. That's the only way you can possibly  say that my righteous deed stinks. I mean, how could a righteous deed stink?

How could doing the  right thing stink? How could be a stench in God's nostrils? Well, the answer is the gospel  turns you into a kind of Nietzschean person when you look at your own heart. You begin Nietzsche,  of course, was always looking at motives. Nietzsche is almost invented what's called the Hermann  Unix's suspicion.

Looking inside and saying, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're real good. You  go to church, you do this, you do that. But why? Why do you, you say to everybody, we should love  everybody, but why do you say everybody? What aren't you really trying to do is you're trying to keep  people down?

Are you trying to be superior? You say, oh, we should obey and should be very moral,  but why aren't you really trying to stay in power? You see, a Christian looks at my your own heart,  and here's what the Christian is saying. Christian is somebody who says, I become, I come to realize that  the reason for my sins and the reason for my good deeds is the same and it's wrong. I don't, even when I do a bad deed, I'm trying to be my own Lord, but when I do a good deed,  I am too.

When I do a bad deed, I'm trying to be my own Savior, but when I do a good deed,  I'm trying to be my own Savior. When I do good deeds, I'm really trying to get God to do right  by me, and I'm trying to control him. I'm trying to put him in my debt. I'm trying to, you see, one of the ways you can tell your righteousness is a filthy rag. A lot of you  are very righteous.

I'm going to thank you to do many good things, but you're always angry because  God's not letting your life go right. Why is that? You know why? He said, I've lived this very good  life and my sister-in-law is not living a very good life for my brother, and I know why is my  life going so bad? Whoa, whoa, wait a minute, Nietzsche says, wait a minute.

Why were you being good? Trying to get God to do your will. That's the essence of sin. Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache. We feel it in the world  around us and in our own lives.

How did it get this way? And what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing this month, What Is Wrong with the World? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer, drawing from a series of teachings given  at Redeemer. Dr.

Keller shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us,  and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes or choices,  or looking for hope and joy, What Is Wrong with the World will help you see how the gospel  speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us. This newly released book,  What Is Wrong with the World is our thanks for your gift this month to help gospel in life share  the good news of Jesus.

It's very essence of sin. Everybody does my will. See, you know, you're a life for mine,  not my life for yours. Our wills cross, I get my way, you know? Your righteousness is a filthy  rag.

Now here's what goes on, unless you believe in a God of judgment and justice and you come into  the presence of that God, you're never going to be humbled. I'll tell you, and it's Christians who  understand this who are the most civil people. What do I mean by that? Unless you believe in an  angry God, you won't be civil. How are you going to live in a place like New York City with all these  people that are so different?

Different beliefs, different races, different cultures, different  philosophies, different religions. How are you going to be? Now, people with traditional religious  values have a tremendous, a trouble living in a city. Because they say, I've got the truth. I got the truth.

And therefore, I feel so superior to so many of these other people. You're not  going to be good citizens. You're not going to serve them. You're not going to sit down and treat them  as equals. You're just not.

But if you say, oh, I passed that, you see, I believe everything is  relative. But what are you going to do? You're going to be so upset with people who believe in absolute  values. You're going to, right, you're going to say, I'm so much better than they are. I hate those  kinds of people.

But wait a minute. Do you know how many people believe in absolute values in  New York City? Look at all the Muslims. Look at all the Orthodox Jews. See, look at all the,  you know, look at all the people of your Protestant who are Catholic, or your Catholic who are Protestant  and so forth.

I want you to know that unless you believe that you deserve judgment, you're going  to be a lousy neighbor. You're not going to look out next door and say, hey, I deserve as much  judgment as any perpetrator in this world. And therefore, I don't look at myself as superior to you. Unless you have that, you can be a lousy neighbor. You're not going to live civilly.

You're also not  going to be able to forgive because you're going to put yourself in judgment. One of the reasons why  you have to believe in an angry God who's going to square all accounts is because there's a  tremendous burden that some of you are carrying right now. When you look at what other people have  done to you, in fact, when you look and see what life is done to you, or even what God has done  for you to you, and you get upset because you don't understand why did that happen to me? What  you've done is you don't have an angry God. You're putting yourself in the shoes of a judge.

You don't believe in a God who really is going to judge. And that's the reason why you can't  forgive. If you're having trouble forgiving somebody right now, it's because you're stuck in  verses one, two or three, one, two, three. You haven't gotten a verses four to six yet. If you're having trouble, in fact, if you're having trouble even understanding why God  let this or that happen.

If you're just so upset because God didn't let this happen, God didn't let  that happen. This week, I was reminded of something that happened me a long time ago. I had a big  impact on my life. Why am I here tonight? Why is this church here?

Because my Presbyterian  denomination sent me to New York. Well, why was I Presbyterian? Well, because I fell in the  influence of a particular teacher my last semester and seminary. My last semester in graduate school. And he just got there barely because, you know, at the very end, but because I fell under his  influence, I became a Presbyterian therefore I was sent here and therefore we're here.

Hi, so why did that person come to that school? Well, you know, he almost didn't make it,  but he was, because he was British and he was having visa problems. But somebody in the state  department knew somebody at the seminary and a person in the seminary pulled some strings and he  got there just in time. So that person hadn't pulled those strings. He wouldn't have gotten there.

I wouldn't have come to his influence. I wouldn't have been Presbyterian. I wouldn't be here. Well, somebody says that's interesting. Why did somebody at the seminary have power the state  department?

Well, there was a student at the seminary then named Mike Ford whose father was Gerald  Ford who was the president of the United States at the time. Well, why was his father? That's why he had  cool. Well, why was his father president of the United States? Well, because Nixon resigned.

Well, why did Nixon resign? Because of the Watergate scandal. Well, why was there a Watergate  scandal? Because two burglars at the Watergate building kind of botched the job because one of them  forgot to close the door and latch it. And a night watchman noticed that the door was open, came in,  discovered that there was a burglary and et cetera, et cetera.

Now, here's the point. What if that door  hadn't been left open? We wouldn't be here. You wouldn't be here. Do you dare think you ever know  enough about what's going on in your life to be mad at God for it?

Do you know why this and that  happens? How could you ever be in a position to be the judge? Why are you worried because you don't  have an angry God who's working everything out justly? Why are you worried? Why can't you forgive?

Why can't you live in this city, civilly looking at everybody else as an equal because you don't have  an angry God? So first of all, you need an angry God if you're going to live in hope. Secondly,  you've got to have an angry God if you're going to live in humility, civility, thirdly. And lastly,  you need an angry God if you're really going to understand how loved you are. Now, I know this sounds the most contradictory.

What? The angrier you understand God to be against  sin and evil, the greater His wrath, the greater His justice, the greater His judgment, the more you  believe in hell, to the degree that you grasp those truths, to that degree you'll know how much  He loves you. Let's move right on down through the text. First of all, look, verses 8 and 9,  something very interesting happens here, especially the Stegelic here, verse 8. Yet, O Father,  you are our Father, we are the clay, you are the potter, we are all the work of your hand.

Do not  be angry beyond measure, O Lord, do not remember our sins forever. Now, you know, this is very interesting. First of all, God is characterized here as a Father and as an artist, a Father and an artist. See, because first of all, he says, you are our Father, that means us your children,  us his children, and you are the potter, which means he's the artist and we are the clay, we're the  aren't work. Now, first, there's two things that actually are derived from this verse.

First of  all, look, the first thing we're told is that God's love is the cause of his anger. Because notice, he doesn't say, yet, O Lord, you are our Father and you are our artist,  so you shouldn't be angry. That's not what he says. He said, you shouldn't be angry forever. You shouldn't be angry beyond measure.

Beyond measure, actually, it literally means unto  muchness, which is the same as ultimately forever. Go back. The first thing that teaches us is  because he's a Father and because he's an artist, his anger is justified. Very important to see,  he doesn't say, because you're our Father, you shouldn't be angry. Oh, no, not at all.

Fathers and artists get angry. Oh, my, do they get angry? It's so interesting that this verse,  in light of this famous quote by C.S. Lewis, in the problem of pain, chapter 3, Lewis says this,  you ask for a loving God? Well, you have one.

The great Lord of terrible aspect loves you. Not a senile benevolence that drowsily wishes you to be happy in your own way. Not the cold philanthropy of a conscientious magistrate, nor the care of a host who feels somehow  responsible for the comfort of his guests, but the consuming fire himself. The love that made  the world's persistent as the artist's love for her work, a Father's love for a child,  inexorable and exacting as a man's love for his wife. Now, what is he saying?

I'll say what he's  saying. The opposite of love is not anger. Oh, no, the opposite of love is hate, and the ultimate  hate is indifference. But see, when you're passionately hating somebody, you're really giving them  quite a lot of attention. I mean, you're treating them as important.

I mean, if that's not so bad,  the passionately, the ultimate hate is to be not care. And therefore, if God looks down at this  world and sees how we're treating each other and sees how we're living and sees how we're treating him,  if God looks out this world and is not furious, he is not a Father and he is not an artist,  and we are not his artwork and we are not his kids. If God is a, because, as Louis says, some other  place, anger is what love bleeds when you cut it. If someone really loves you and you're screwing  up and you're doing something wrong, then you're blowing it and you're doing a lot of bad things,  that person is furious at you. And if they're not furious at you, it doesn't matter what they say,  that's just sentimentality, they don't love you.

And therefore, what we see, first of all,  it's very important, is God's love is furious love and is furious loving fury. They come together,  you've got to believe in both. That's what we're trying to do. We're trying to show you that they're  really two sides the same coin. So God's love is the cause of his anger.

But the second thing we're  told here, and this is the tension almost, God's love also is not just the cause of his anger. God's love is also the satisfaction of his anger. It's not just here we're being taught that  this is love that causes his anger. It's also being hinted at, but it's very strong. Yet because  your father, you should be angry, but do something about your anger.

Don't be angry forever. Don't be  angry unto muchness. Don't be angry ultimately. Do something. There's a fascinating place where Louis,  C.S.

Lewis is writing a guy named Malcolm, and Malcolm says, oh, I don't like this idea of an  angry God. I just can't buy this idea of an angry God. And Louis says something fascinating. He says,  my dear Malcolm, think of the fullest reconciliation between people. Is peace restored through a moral  lecture?

Or is peace restored if the offense is not said to matter? Now that's pretty interesting  because on the one hand, there's moralism and there's relativism. There's two ways to deal. Let's just say somebody's done something wrong. You're un-reconciled with somebody.

You're un-reconciled. What do you do? A moral lecture? Or else, oh, I guess who's to say whether what you did was wrong? A moralism relative?

No, listen, what he says. What should you do? If not moralism and not relativism,  anger. He says, think of the fullest reconciliation between people. Is peace restored through moral  lecture?

Or the offense is not to matter? You know better. Anger, not pivish, fits of temper,  but just generous, scalding indignation. It is anger that passes, not necessarily all at once,  but anger that passes into embracing, exultant, rewelcoming love. That's how friends and lovers  are truly reconciled.

Hot wrath and then hot love. Such anger is the fluid that love bleeds when  you cut it. I know what he's talking about. So it's probably you, but you know how rare that is. Because usually, usually when somebody sins against you, you're not angry because you don't love them.

Other times, you are angry because you do love them. But when you get that anger expressed,  you blow up at them. You don't know how to do a surgical strike with your anger. What Lewis is saying  is he says, a moral lecture where you hold the anger in or you try to blow it off or you shrug it off  or you pass it over. That doesn't work.

Here's what works. When you come in, you express your anger and  you say, I love you. That's why I'm angry. And I hate what you're doing to yourself and I hate what  you're doing to my relationship with you. And I won't put up with it anymore.

And I'm mad. And when you do a surgical strike, when you actually put the anger on the sin, when you put the anger  on the evil, when you pour out your wrath on the sin itself, it's keeping you from the other person. Very often, that kind of anger is what really wakes the person up. That kind of anger is what really  embraces makes you eventually fall in each other's arms. Oh yeah.

Hot. Hot anger. Hot love. God did do it. We know he did it because remember our sins no more.

Do something. Your love is the  cause of your anger, but let your love be the satisfaction of your anger. And of course verse 17 says,  yeah, of course, he says, I will recreate you. I will change you. I will remember your sins no more.

How did he do it? Well, it's pretty simple, but it's critical on the cross. We read about it last  week on the cross. Is God going to be a God of justice, but not a God of fury, but not love? Is he  going to punish us, but then he loses us, or is he going to love us and then not be just?

Only if  the cross happened, only if the cross happened. Can he be a God of furious love and loving fury? All at once. Because all he hears what the Bible teaches. Jesus Christ is the judge who was judged.

Jesus Christ took all of the anger for all the wrath, for all of the injustice. And it went into  his heart, so that when you believe in him, there's nothing left for you. Now, he don't ask you this  question. Now, let's go back. This is the point.

Do you believe in a God of wrath? Ah, somebody says,  no, I don't. I don't, I believe God is a God of love. I don't believe he punishes people. What did it  cost your God to love you?

Well, you say, I don't know, nothing. I guess. Well, then how do you  know how much you love? He loves you. This is the reason why you're not thrilled by the idea.

This  reason why you haven't had your life changed by the idea. It's just sentimentality. To the degree  you believe in justice and you believe in anger and you believe in hell to that degree, you know  how much you're worth to him because he paid it. If you don't believe in hell, if you don't believe  in punishment, if you don't believe in justice and if you don't believe in judgment, you have no  idea what God did for you. You have no idea what Jesus did for you.

You have no idea how valuable you  are. You don't walk around filling love to the sky. You don't, you don't. And it's your fault  because you don't have an angry God because you're just going along with what everybody said. Don't do it.

If you know what he did for you, if you know there's no judgment left for you,  then when you're walking on the street like this happens to everybody and something comes along and  hits you and you say, you call yourself a good person. That voice, the part you wretch,  retreat and shame. And Jesus says, come hear my love, I bore the blame. You must sit down and taste  my meat. So I did sit and eat at George Herbert.

But look, here's what, how do you know he loves you? How do you know how much he loves you? How do you walk around filling love? Angry God who paid  the penalty himself. Now look, let's just, let's conclude with this just a couple of thoughts.

Remember I said in the beginning, unless you have a God of both fury and love, loving fury and  furious love, there'll be distortions in your life. Just think about this with me for a second. Okay, let's apply this. Do you have a God of love only? Love without anger.

You know, love,  do you have a God who never says no to you? There's anything in the Bible you don't like you say,  why can't believe in that anymore? Therefore you don't have a God who can contradict you. You don't  have a God who can say no to you. You don't have a God who actually does anything, but always accept  you.

That means you don't have a God. You have it, but yourself. And here's what you're like. Try to raise a kid like that. Try to raise a kid where you never contradict them.

You never  cross their will. You never chaste in them. You never discipline them. You never say no to them. Raise a child like that.

Listen, abusive parents are pretty bad. Permissive parents are every bit  as bad. Kids that grow up like that feel like orphans and they are. And people who grow up with  an idea of a God who just loves them and accepts them in every way, they grow up feeling like orphan  spiritually and they are. You know, you say, you know, you have a God of love without fury.

You don't really have a God. But then on the other hand, do you have an angry God who's not a God  of love, a God of standards, a God of righteousness? It won't work. Your life won't work. You know,  it's interesting at the end of Luke 16, a very famous parable of Lazarus in the rich man.

There's a  place where Abraham's calls him in pardon me. The rich man is down in hell and he calls up to  Abraham and he says, Father Abraham, if I knew about hell, you know, I wouldn't have lived the way  I lived. So my brothers are still alive. Would you please send somebody back from the dead to go and  tell them about this place? So they'll judge them in their lives.

And what does Abraham say? It won't be enough. You said, what? Somebody coming back from the dead saying, stop, you know,  it's Marley's ghost. Oh, stop, please, obey the thinking amendments.

Or you'll be like me. That won't  be enough. It was enough for Scrooge. That's fiction. That's fiction.

I'm a pastor. I've seen an  awful lot of people make promises to an angry God. Promises when they felt like they were stock promises  when they felt like, oh, I better do something or God's going to get me. They never work because  fear cannot awaken love in you. Only love can awaken love in you.

And if you have nothing but an  angry guy, see if you have a loving God without fury, you've got nothing. But if you have a  furious God without love, you've got something and it'll crush you. You will be a driven person. You'll never be able to live up. You'll always be fling with no one pursuing.

You'll be like  two little butters stretched over too much bread. When Paul said, the love of Christ constrains me,  he was thinking of Jesus Christ another wrath of God, and that turned him into a man of courage. It melted his heart. It can do the same thing for you. If you have never surrendered your life to  this God, do you know what that means?

His anger is at work in your life. What? Yes, to drive  you into the arms of his love, because that's what his anger is always after. So, go along. Let's  pray.

Our Father, I pray if there's anybody here tonight who's certainly upset with the idea  of an angry God, I pray that they would think and not just react. Father, for many of us, we have  the intellectual belief that you're a God of justice and judgment, but we haven't thought out what  the implications of that are. We pray that you would give us more peace. You would give us more  civility, more humility and a greater sense of our love, our loveness. And we ask that you would  help us do that tonight by the power of your Holy Spirit.

We thank you, Lord, that you're a God  like this. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today, more and more, we believe in a loving and good God who's more accepting of  people. And that's the gist of it. I don't know. I was there. I mean, I had that in eighth  grade, ninth grade.

But here's what I'm going to say, the biblical and three God, the angry  God that's presented to us by the Bible. Yeah, we have lost, but yet we have lost connection  with it in our society and our culture. And I'm here to tell you, it's a bad thing. In fact,  I'll go this far. You need an angry God.

You need in your mind and in your heart a God  that gets angry at sin. You need an angry God to live with hope. You need an angry God  to live with humility and you need an angry God to know how loved you are. And if you don't  believe in an angry God, a really angry God who hates sin and is going to punish it,  you're impoverishing yourself. You're taking away all sorts of hope and humility and love.

That's what I'm here to tell you. And you know, you say, how does that work out? Well, okay,  let's go. First of all, and basically you just work right through the text on this. First of all,  verses one to three tell us that you need an angry God, the biblical angry God, to live in hope.

To be able to live in hope in a broken world. One of the things that's easy to miss when you  studies these books like Aziz, in fact, big parts of the Old Testament, is that they have a historical  situation. They were not just written as essays. They weren't lectures. They were written  into a historical situation.

And everybody agrees that Isaiah chapter 40 and following after chapter  40 was written to a nation to Israel that was facing exile, that was facing tremendous injustice,  that was going to face or did face or had faced when they read this. Their capital city drew  some torn down. Their own children slaughtered. Go read about it in Psalm 137. Their infants,  their little heads of their infant stashed against the rock by the victors.

Captivity,  chains, terrible injustice. And so what are they doing? Well, we see in verses one to three,  they're asking God to come down and judge the injustice. They're saying, oh, well,  you would run the heavens and come down. The mountains would tremble before you.

As when fire sets, twigs of blaze come down to make your name known to your enemies and cause  the nations to quake. And what they're really saying is, if you came down with all your justice and  you went after the oppressors and you went after the perpetrators of injustice, they would be like  dust before you. They would crumble. They would be like burning twigs that the wind drives away. And so they're saying, of course, this is what verses one to three sang.

How in the world could  you possibly live in a world filled with injustice with any hope at all, unless you believed in a  and angry God? God gets angry in injustice. And so here's the first point. First point is the  God's anger in the Bible is not like our anger usually is. It's not crankiness.

It's not ill  temper. It's not ego. It's not it's not explosion. It's not out of control. It's a settled, fixed,  implacable, irrevocable, incorruptible, opposition to injustice and evil.

So that,  no debt will go unpaid. Every account will be squared and nobody will get away with anything. And that's what the Bible means when it says there's an angry God. That's the kind of God  that we have. That's what the Bible presents.

Now right away, objection. I know. Right away,  people immediately put up their hands and say, wait a minute. One of the problems with that,  one of the reasons why many people, most people in New York City certainly believe that that's a  primitive idea is they say, you know what? This idea of a God of vengeance.

Oh my, it's primitive. We've got to get beyond that because we need to work for a peaceful world. This idea of a vengeful  God who bears the sword. Oh my work. That leads to intolerance and eventually the violence.

What you really need is you need to believe in an accepting God if you're going to believe in a God. You have to believe that sin is in the eye of the beholder. You have to believe that sin is sort of  a matter of perspective. This idea of a God of vengeance. That's going to lead to nothing but  violence.

Nothing but intolerance and violence. Well recently I read a book that is one of the most  powerful refutations of that extremely common belief that we have to get beyond a God of vengeance  if we're going to have a world of peace. Incredible book actually. In many ways, it's a book by  written by Miroslav Wolf, whose Croatian and the name of the book is exclusion and embrace. And let me read you his thesis.

He says in this book, because his Croatian, he was raised in  the former Yugoslavia, he has seen all the stuff the people who this passage was written to,  who are crying out for vengeance and crying out because of the injustice. He's seen all that. He's been through that. And this is what he says. The practice of nonviolence requires a belief  in divine vengeance.

I'll say that again because it just, I mean, if nobody's eyebrows are raised,  you're not listening. The practice of, there we go, that's better. The practice of nonviolence  requires a belief in divine vengeance. He says, the only way to nonviolence is to believe in a God  who gets angry at injustice. Without an angry God, you'll never get out.

You'll never get into  nonviolence. You'll be stuck in the cycle of violence. Now, how does he make that point? Well,  here it is. Here's the quote.

And he says, my thesis that the practice of nonviolence requires a  belief in divine vengeance will be unpopular with many Christians, especially in the West. But to the person inclined to dismiss it, please imagine something. Imagine you're delivering  a lecture in a war zone where I delivered this chapter as a paper. And among your listeners are  people whose cities and villages have first been plundered, then burned, and then leveled to the ground,  whose daughters and sisters have been raped, and whose fathers and brothers have had their  throat slit. Now, the topic of your lecture is a Christian attitude toward violence,  and the thesis is we should not retaliate and be sucked into the cycle of continued violence.

We should not pay back. Why not? And here's what he says, violence thrives today, secretly nourished  by the belief that God refuses to take the sword. And then he says, if you do this, if you lecture  like this, soon you will discover that it takes the quiet of a suburb for the birth of the thesis. The human nonviolence is the result of a God who refuses to judge.

And a scorch man soaked in  the blood of innocent, of the innocent, the idea will invariably die like other pleasant  captivity of a liberal mind. In a world of violence, it would not be worthy of God not to wield the  sword. If God were not angry at injustice and deception, did not take a final end of violence,  that guy would not be worthy of our worship. Now, can I put it in a nutshell? Here's what he's saying.

Anybody who says that a God of vengeance will lead to violence has not actually been a victim  of violence themselves. You live in a nice suburban little bubble, or a very, very nice area where  you haven't yourself been the victim of injustice. He says, when you're the victim of injustice,  you will have to pay back unless you're assured that there is a God of vengeance, that there is a  God who hates injustice, that there's a God who's angry with injustice. And a God who's going to settle  every account so that nobody gets away with anything, unless you believe in a God of divine vengeance,  you will not be able to resist picking up the sword and being, you know, being the avenger yourself,  or else you'll just die at a spare. That's the reason why he's able to come back and say it's  the practice of non-violence that absolutely requires a belief in divine vengeance.

And so here's  our first point. You know, people say, why do I need an angry God? He says non-violence is impossible  without belief in a judge. In fact, let me, let me, let me go, let me press a little further. If  you are, what he calls the victim of one of these liberal piety's, you've always heard of,  I believe in a God of justice, that would not lead to peace in the world.

That would lead to more  violence. He says, you will be absolutely, if anybody ever comes and actually does something bad to  you, you will be sucked right into pay back. Actually, you've been already. He just haven't had,  maybe in many cases, you haven't had actually, somebody actually attack you and draw blood or kill  you or kill, or kill people in that your family. And anybody tried to do that.

He says, because  unless you believe in a God of vengeance, you will not be a peacemaker. You will not be able to  live a life of peace in the world. You will not be able to live a life of hope in the world. In fact, one thing that worries about me, if I look out at it, many of you, many of you do live in  that bubble because most of us live in a world far more safe and far more happy and far more secure  than most other people who have lived anywhere else in the world or anywhere in any other time in  history. And if that bubble should break and you have a nambi-pambi God who does not wreak  vengeance on injustice, you will either get sucked into the violence you will have to pay back yourself  or else.

You'll die in despair. That's the first thing. You need a God. You need an angry God  where you won't be able to live in peace in an unjust world. Secondly, you need an angry God  if you're going to live in humility.

Now, here's what's so intriguing. Let's move right on to the  next three verses. All the commentators say it is extremely interesting to see the ironic  relationship between the first and second stanza, the first stanza is verses one to three. We just  read it. What they're saying is, we are the victims of injustice.

And so we call down into the world  the God of judgment. If you would only come down and make the mountains shake, what would happen? Well, the enemies, the wicked people, the enemies, the bad nations, what they would do is they  would just, they would be consumed. They would become dust. They'd become consumed.

And they would,  the wind would blow them away. But get this. See, before you, verse two, the nations would quake  before you. But now look, verses four, five, and six, here's the great irony. Who's tripling up now?

Who is wasting away? See, who is tripling up like a leaf, verse six? And like the wind, our sins sweep us away. They are. The very thing they call God down  to do is happening to them.

And this is what we were saying. And this is, at this point, by the way,  this is an extremely important little test to know whether or not you're understanding the difference  between the angry God that maybe you were taught about, or you taught other people, maybe  somebody taught you about this as you were growing up, or maybe you were taught other people  believed in an angry God. And the angry God of the Bible, when you meet the angry God of the  Bible, you will find out and you will come to see what they see. You'll get out of verses one to  three. When you're in one to three, what you're thinking is if God would come down, the bad people  would be judged.

But in verses four to six, they find out that we deserve as much judgment as  anybody else, that we too are under judgment, that we too absolutely deserve punishment as much  as those people that we thought were the wicked perpetrators. That's absolutely critical,  and this is one of the great tests to know whether or not you're getting in touch with the  biblical God. Let me show you what I mean. There's two kinds of people in the world that seem to  be opposites. There's two kinds of people in the world, those who divide everybody in the world,  in the two kinds of people, and those who don't.

Did you know that? Well, I meant there's two  groups of people that are very prominent. I wouldn't say there's only two kinds of people here. On the one hand, you've got people we would call religious people, traditionally religious. And they certainly believe that there are absolute standards, and that there are absolute moral values,  and that we're going to be judged by them.

And therefore they believe that if God were to come down,  He would judge the bad people. And people who are religious, they say, well, I don't cheat on my  spouse, and I go to my family, and I obey the Ten Commandments, and I go to church, or synagogue,  and I give to the poor, and so on. I'm a good person. And so you're in versus one to three. You say,  if God were to come down, you see, the bad people would be judged, and they feel pretty good about  themselves.

On the other hand, you've got their nemesis. I mean, in our society, the nemesis,  so that people believe in traditional moral values, are, you might call this secular people,  progressive liberal people, and what they say is, you know what? Everybody,  sin is in the eye of the beholder. Everybody's got their own way of defining sin. What sinful for  you wouldn't be sinful for me, and what we have to do is we have to embrace them.

We have to embrace  everybody. We have to tolerate everybody. We have to accept everybody. And they look very, very  tolerant, except they're just as much in versus one and three. Because what they are saying is,  yes, you know, what the trouble with this world is, is all those people over there who are in tolerant.

I'm not like them. You see, they're religious people, and they're religious people,  are all walking around saying, if only everybody in the world was like me, we wouldn't be in trouble. If only those people over there that are causing the trouble, if somebody would just knock them down. And so you see, it really doesn't matter whether you're religious or religious, whether you're  conservative or liberal, if you live in versus one, two, and three. But what happens to Christians?

When they finally get close and to see what God really is like, inevitably, what they say is,  verse six, all of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are filthy  rags. Now that is a stunning statement. In fact, you know, when you first read through it, you say,  wait, what? He didn't say all our sins are his filthy rags. Of course, they're filthy rags.

All our righteous, and he's not just saying righteousness is just a sort of a general thing,  our righteous deeds are filthy rags. What happens is a Christian has begun to look past the  externals into his or her own heart. Start looking at motivations. That's the only way you can possibly  say that my righteous deed stinks. I mean, how could a righteous deed stink?

How could doing the  right thing stink? How could be a stench in God's nostrils? Well, the answer is the gospel  turns you into a kind of Nietzschean person when you look at your own heart. You begin Nietzsche,  of course, was always looking at motives. Nietzsche is almost invented what's called the Hermann  Unix's suspicion.

Looking inside and saying, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're real good. You  go to church, you do this, you do that. But why? Why do you, you say to everybody, we should love  everybody, but why do you say everybody? What aren't you really trying to do is you're trying to keep  people down?

Are you trying to be superior? You say, oh, we should obey and should be very moral,  but why aren't you really trying to stay in power? You see, a Christian looks at my your own heart,  and here's what the Christian is saying. Christian is somebody who says, I become, I come to realize that  the reason for my sins and the reason for my good deeds is the same and it's wrong. I don't, even when I do a bad deed, I'm trying to be my own Lord, but when I do a good deed,  I am too.

When I do a bad deed, I'm trying to be my own Savior, but when I do a good deed,  I'm trying to be my own Savior. When I do good deeds, I'm really trying to get God to do right  by me, and I'm trying to control him. I'm trying to put him in my debt. I'm trying to, you see, one of the ways you can tell your righteousness is a filthy rag. A lot of you  are very righteous.

I'm going to thank you to do many good things, but you're always angry because  God's not letting your life go right. Why is that? You know why? He said, I've lived this very good  life and my sister-in-law is not living a very good life for my brother, and I know why is my  life going so bad? Whoa, whoa, wait a minute, Nietzsche says, wait a minute.

Why were you being good? Trying to get God to do your will. That's the essence of sin. Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache. We feel it in the world  around us and in our own lives.

How did it get this way? And what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing this month, What Is Wrong with the World? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer, drawing from a series of teachings given  at Redeemer. Dr.

Keller shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us,  and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes or choices,  or looking for hope and joy, What Is Wrong with the World will help you see how the gospel  speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us. This newly released book,  What Is Wrong with the World is our thanks for your gift this month to help gospel in life share  the good news of Jesus. Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com-slashgive. That's gospelandlife.com-slash-give.

It's very essence of sin. Everybody does my will. See, you know, you're a life for mine,  not my life for yours. Our wills cross, I get my way, you know? Your righteousness is a filthy  rag.

Now here's what goes on, unless you believe in a God of judgment and justice and you come into  the presence of that God, you're never going to be humbled. I'll tell you, and it's Christians who  understand this who are the most civil people. What do I mean by that? Unless you believe in an  angry God, you won't be civil. How are you going to live in a place like New York City with all these  people that are so different?

Different beliefs, different races, different cultures, different  philosophies, different religions. How are you going to be? Now, people with traditional religious  values have a tremendous, a trouble living in a city. Because they say, I've got the truth. I got the truth.

And therefore, I feel so superior to so many of these other people. You're not  going to be good citizens. You're not going to serve them. You're not going to sit down and treat them  as equals. You're just not.

But if you say, oh, I passed that, you see, I believe everything is  relative. But what are you going to do? You're going to be so upset with people who believe in absolute  values. You're going to, right, you're going to say, I'm so much better than they are. I hate those  kinds of people.

But wait a minute. Do you know how many people believe in absolute values in  New York City? Look at all the Muslims. Look at all the Orthodox Jews. See, look at all the,  you know, look at all the people of your Protestant who are Catholic, or your Catholic who are Protestant  and so forth.

I want you to know that unless you believe that you deserve judgment, you're going  to be a lousy neighbor. You're not going to look out next door and say, hey, I deserve as much  judgment as any perpetrator in this world. And therefore, I don't look at myself as superior to you. Unless you have that, you can be a lousy neighbor. You're not going to live civilly.

You're also not  going to be able to forgive because you're going to put yourself in judgment. One of the reasons why  you have to believe in an angry God who's going to square all accounts is because there's a  tremendous burden that some of you are carrying right now. When you look at what other people have  done to you, in fact, when you look and see what life is done to you, or even what God has done  for you to you, and you get upset because you don't understand why did that happen to me? What  you've done is you don't have an angry God. You're putting yourself in the shoes of a judge.

You don't believe in a God who really is going to judge. And that's the reason why you can't  forgive. If you're having trouble forgiving somebody right now, it's because you're stuck in  verses one, two or three, one, two, three. You haven't gotten a verses four to six yet. If you're having trouble, in fact, if you're having trouble even understanding why God  let this or that happen.

If you're just so upset because God didn't let this happen, God didn't let  that happen. This week, I was reminded of something that happened me a long time ago. I had a big  impact on my life. Why am I here tonight? Why is this church here?

Because my Presbyterian  denomination sent me to New York. Well, why was I Presbyterian? Well, because I fell in the  influence of a particular teacher my last semester and seminary. My last semester in graduate school. And he just got there barely because, you know, at the very end, but because I fell under his  influence, I became a Presbyterian therefore I was sent here and therefore we're here.

Hi, so why did that person come to that school? Well, you know, he almost didn't make it,  but he was, because he was British and he was having visa problems. But somebody in the state  department knew somebody at the seminary and a person in the seminary pulled some strings and he  got there just in time. So that person hadn't pulled those strings. He wouldn't have gotten there.

I wouldn't have come to his influence. I wouldn't have been Presbyterian. I wouldn't be here. Well, somebody says that's interesting. Why did somebody at the seminary have power the state  department?

Well, there was a student at the seminary then named Mike Ford whose father was Gerald  Ford who was the president of the United States at the time. Well, why was his father? That's why he had  cool. Well, why was his father president of the United States? Well, because Nixon resigned.

Well, why did Nixon resign? Because of the Watergate scandal. Well, why was there a Watergate  scandal? Because two burglars at the Watergate building kind of botched the job because one of them  forgot to close the door and latch it. And a night watchman noticed that the door was open, came in,  discovered that there was a burglary and et cetera, et cetera.

Now, here's the point. What if that door  hadn't been left open? We wouldn't be here. You wouldn't be here. Do you dare think you ever know  enough about what's going on in your life to be mad at God for it?

Do you know why this and that  happens? How could you ever be in a position to be the judge? Why are you worried because you don't  have an angry God who's working everything out justly? Why are you worried? Why can't you forgive?

Why can't you live in this city, civilly looking at everybody else as an equal because you don't have  an angry God? So first of all, you need an angry God if you're going to live in hope. Secondly,  you've got to have an angry God if you're going to live in humility, civility, thirdly. And lastly,  you need an angry God if you're really going to understand how loved you are. Now, I know this sounds the most contradictory.

What? The angrier you understand God to be against  sin and evil, the greater His wrath, the greater His justice, the greater His judgment, the more you  believe in hell, to the degree that you grasp those truths, to that degree you'll know how much  He loves you. Let's move right on down through the text. First of all, look, verses 8 and 9,  something very interesting happens here, especially the Stegelic here, verse 8. Yet, O Father,  you are our Father, we are the clay, you are the potter, we are all the work of your hand.

Do not  be angry beyond measure, O Lord, do not remember our sins forever. Now, you know, this is very interesting. First of all, God is characterized here as a Father and as an artist, a Father and an artist. See, because first of all, he says, you are our Father, that means us your children,  us his children, and you are the potter, which means he's the artist and we are the clay, we're the  aren't work. Now, first, there's two things that actually are derived from this verse.

First of  all, look, the first thing we're told is that God's love is the cause of his anger. Because notice, he doesn't say, yet, O Lord, you are our Father and you are our artist,  so you shouldn't be angry. That's not what he says. He said, you shouldn't be angry forever. You shouldn't be angry beyond measure.

Beyond measure, actually, it literally means unto  muchness, which is the same as ultimately forever. Go back. The first thing that teaches us is  because he's a Father and because he's an artist, his anger is justified. Very important to see,  he doesn't say, because you're our Father, you shouldn't be angry. Oh, no, not at all.

Fathers and artists get angry. Oh, my, do they get angry? It's so interesting that this verse,  in light of this famous quote by C.S. Lewis, in the problem of pain, chapter 3, Lewis says this,  you ask for a loving God? Well, you have one.

The great Lord of terrible aspect loves you. Not a senile benevolence that drowsily wishes you to be happy in your own way. Not the cold philanthropy of a conscientious magistrate, nor the care of a host who feels somehow  responsible for the comfort of his guests, but the consuming fire himself. The love that made  the world's persistent as the artist's love for her work, a Father's love for a child,  inexorable and exacting as a man's love for his wife. Now, what is he saying?

I'll say what he's  saying. The opposite of love is not anger. Oh, no, the opposite of love is hate, and the ultimate  hate is indifference. But see, when you're passionately hating somebody, you're really giving them  quite a lot of attention. I mean, you're treating them as important.

I mean, if that's not so bad,  the passionately, the ultimate hate is to be not care. And therefore, if God looks down at this  world and sees how we're treating each other and sees how we're living and sees how we're treating him,  if God looks out this world and is not furious, he is not a Father and he is not an artist,  and we are not his artwork and we are not his kids. If God is a, because, as Louis says, some other  place, anger is what love bleeds when you cut it. If someone really loves you and you're screwing  up and you're doing something wrong, then you're blowing it and you're doing a lot of bad things,  that person is furious at you. And if they're not furious at you, it doesn't matter what they say,  that's just sentimentality, they don't love you.

And therefore, what we see, first of all,  it's very important, is God's love is furious love and is furious loving fury. They come together,  you've got to believe in both. That's what we're trying to do. We're trying to show you that they're  really two sides the same coin. So God's love is the cause of his anger.

But the second thing we're  told here, and this is the tension almost, God's love also is not just the cause of his anger. God's love is also the satisfaction of his anger. It's not just here we're being taught that  this is love that causes his anger. It's also being hinted at, but it's very strong. Yet because  your father, you should be angry, but do something about your anger.

Don't be angry forever. Don't be  angry unto muchness. Don't be angry ultimately. Do something. There's a fascinating place where Louis,  C.S.

Lewis is writing a guy named Malcolm, and Malcolm says, oh, I don't like this idea of an  angry God. I just can't buy this idea of an angry God. And Louis says something fascinating. He says,  my dear Malcolm, think of the fullest reconciliation between people. Is peace restored through a moral  lecture?

Or is peace restored if the offense is not said to matter? Now that's pretty interesting  because on the one hand, there's moralism and there's relativism. There's two ways to deal. Let's just say somebody's done something wrong. You're un-reconciled with somebody.

You're un-reconciled. What do you do? A moral lecture? Or else, oh, I guess who's to say whether what you did was wrong? A moralism relative?

No, listen, what he says. What should you do? If not moralism and not relativism,  anger. He says, think of the fullest reconciliation between people. Is peace restored through moral  lecture?

Or the offense is not to matter? You know better. Anger, not pivish, fits of temper,  but just generous, scalding indignation. It is anger that passes, not necessarily all at once,  but anger that passes into embracing, exultant, rewelcoming love. That's how friends and lovers  are truly reconciled.

Hot wrath and then hot love. Such anger is the fluid that love bleeds when  you cut it. I know what he's talking about. So it's probably you, but you know how rare that is. Because usually, usually when somebody sins against you, you're not angry because you don't love them.

Other times, you are angry because you do love them. But when you get that anger expressed,  you blow up at them. You don't know how to do a surgical strike with your anger. What Lewis is saying  is he says, a moral lecture where you hold the anger in or you try to blow it off or you shrug it off  or you pass it over. That doesn't work.

Here's what works. When you come in, you express your anger and  you say, I love you. That's why I'm angry. And I hate what you're doing to yourself and I hate what  you're doing to my relationship with you. And I won't put up with it anymore.

And I'm mad. And when you do a surgical strike, when you actually put the anger on the sin, when you put the anger  on the evil, when you pour out your wrath on the sin itself, it's keeping you from the other person. Very often, that kind of anger is what really wakes the person up. That kind of anger is what really  embraces makes you eventually fall in each other's arms. Oh yeah.

Hot. Hot anger. Hot love. God did do it. We know he did it because remember our sins no more.

Do something. Your love is the  cause of your anger, but let your love be the satisfaction of your anger. And of course verse 17 says,  yeah, of course, he says, I will recreate you. I will change you. I will remember your sins no more.

How did he do it? Well, it's pretty simple, but it's critical on the cross. We read about it last  week on the cross. Is God going to be a God of justice, but not a God of fury, but not love? Is he  going to punish us, but then he loses us, or is he going to love us and then not be just?

Only if  the cross happened, only if the cross happened. Can he be a God of furious love and loving fury? All at once. Because all he hears what the Bible teaches. Jesus Christ is the judge who was judged.

Jesus Christ took all of the anger for all the wrath, for all of the injustice. And it went into  his heart, so that when you believe in him, there's nothing left for you. Now, he don't ask you this  question. Now, let's go back. This is the point.

Do you believe in a God of wrath? Ah, somebody says,  no, I don't. I don't, I believe God is a God of love. I don't believe he punishes people. What did it  cost your God to love you?

Well, you say, I don't know, nothing. I guess. Well, then how do you  know how much you love? He loves you. This is the reason why you're not thrilled by the idea.

This  reason why you haven't had your life changed by the idea. It's just sentimentality. To the degree  you believe in justice and you believe in anger and you believe in hell to that degree, you know  how much you're worth to him because he paid it. If you don't believe in hell, if you don't believe  in punishment, if you don't believe in justice and if you don't believe in judgment, you have no  idea what God did for you. You have no idea what Jesus did for you.

You have no idea how valuable you  are. You don't walk around filling love to the sky. You don't, you don't. And it's your fault  because you don't have an angry God because you're just going along with what everybody said. Don't do it.

If you know what he did for you, if you know there's no judgment left for you,  then when you're walking on the street like this happens to everybody and something comes along and  hits you and you say, you call yourself a good person. That voice, the part you wretch,  retreat and shame. And Jesus says, come hear my love, I bore the blame. You must sit down and taste  my meat. So I did sit and eat at George Herbert.

But look, here's what, how do you know he loves you? How do you know how much he loves you? How do you walk around filling love? Angry God who paid  the penalty himself. Now look, let's just, let's conclude with this just a couple of thoughts.

Remember I said in the beginning, unless you have a God of both fury and love, loving fury and  furious love, there'll be distortions in your life. Just think about this with me for a second. Okay, let's apply this. Do you have a God of love only? Love without anger.

You know, love,  do you have a God who never says no to you? There's anything in the Bible you don't like you say,  why can't believe in that anymore? Therefore you don't have a God who can contradict you. You don't  have a God who can say no to you. You don't have a God who actually does anything, but always accept  you.

That means you don't have a God. You have it, but yourself. And here's what you're like. Try to raise a kid like that. Try to raise a kid where you never contradict them.

You never  cross their will. You never chaste in them. You never discipline them. You never say no to them. Raise a child like that.

Listen, abusive parents are pretty bad. Permissive parents are every bit  as bad. Kids that grow up like that feel like orphans and they are. And people who grow up with  an idea of a God who just loves them and accepts them in every way, they grow up feeling like orphan  spiritually and they are. You know, you say, you know, you have a God of love without fury.

You don't really have a God. But then on the other hand, do you have an angry God who's not a God  of love, a God of standards, a God of righteousness? It won't work. Your life won't work. You know,  it's interesting at the end of Luke 16, a very famous parable of Lazarus in the rich man.

There's a  place where Abraham's calls him in pardon me. The rich man is down in hell and he calls up to  Abraham and he says, Father Abraham, if I knew about hell, you know, I wouldn't have lived the way  I lived. So my brothers are still alive. Would you please send somebody back from the dead to go and  tell them about this place? So they'll judge them in their lives.

And what does Abraham say? It won't be enough. You said, what? Somebody coming back from the dead saying, stop, you know,  it's Marley's ghost. Oh, stop, please, obey the thinking amendments.

Or you'll be like me. That won't  be enough. It was enough for Scrooge. That's fiction. That's fiction.

I'm a pastor. I've seen an  awful lot of people make promises to an angry God. Promises when they felt like they were stock promises  when they felt like, oh, I better do something or God's going to get me. They never work because  fear cannot awaken love in you. Only love can awaken love in you.

And if you have nothing but an  angry guy, see if you have a loving God without fury, you've got nothing. But if you have a  furious God without love, you've got something and it'll crush you. You will be a driven person. You'll never be able to live up. You'll always be fling with no one pursuing.

You'll be like  two little butters stretched over too much bread. When Paul said, the love of Christ constrains me,  he was thinking of Jesus Christ another wrath of God, and that turned him into a man of courage. It melted his heart. It can do the same thing for you. If you have never surrendered your life to  this God, do you know what that means?

His anger is at work in your life. What? Yes, to drive  you into the arms of his love, because that's what his anger is always after. So, go along. Let's  pray.

Our Father, I pray if there's anybody here tonight who's certainly upset with the idea  of an angry God, I pray that they would think and not just react. Father, for many of us, we have  the intellectual belief that you're a God of justice and judgment, but we haven't thought out what  the implications of that are. We pray that you would give us more peace. You would give us more  civility, more humility and a greater sense of our love, our loveness. And we ask that you would  help us do that tonight by the power of your Holy Spirit.

We thank you, Lord, that you're a God  like this. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.

### 中文翻译

今天,我们越来越多地相信一位慈爱良善、更能接纳人的上帝。这就是它的要点。我不知道。我在那里,我的意思是,我在八年级、九年级就有这样的想法。

但我要说的是,圣经向我们呈现的这位愤怒的上帝,这位三一上帝。是的,我们已经失去了,但我们在社会和文化中已经失去了与之的联系。我要告诉你,这是一件坏事。事实上,我要说得更进一步。你需要一位愤怒的上帝。

你需要在你的心思意念中有一位对罪恶发怒的上帝。你需要一位愤怒的上帝才能活在盼望中。你需要一位愤怒的上帝才能活在谦卑中,你需要一位愤怒的上帝才能知道自己被爱有多深。如果你不相信一位愤怒的上帝,一位真正对罪恶发怒、要惩罚罪恶的上帝,你就是在使自己贫乏。你正在夺走各种盼望、谦卑和爱。

这就是我要告诉你的。你知道,你说,这怎么行得通呢?好的,让我们开始。首先,基本上你只需要按照经文来理解这一点。首先,第一到三节告诉我们,你需要一位愤怒的上帝,圣经中的愤怒上帝,才能活在盼望中。

才能在一个破碎的世界中活在盼望中。当你研究以赛亚书这样的书时,实际上旧约的大部分内容,有一件容易忽略的事情,就是它们都有历史背景。它们不只是作为文章写的。它们不是讲座。它们是写给一个历史处境的。

大家都同意,以赛亚书第40章及其后的内容是写给一个面临流亡的民族,写给正面临巨大不公义的以色列,他们将要面对或曾经面对或已经面对,当他们读到这些的时候。他们的首都被拆毁。他们自己的孩子被屠杀。去读诗篇137篇。他们婴孩的头颅被得胜者摔在磐石上。

被掳、锁链、可怕的不公义。那么他们在做什么呢?嗯,我们在第一到三节看到,他们在求上帝降临,审判不公义。他们在说,哦,愿你裂天而降。山岭在你面前震动。

如同火烧干柴,火将水烧开,使你的名为你的敌人所知,使列国在你面前战兢。他们真正在说的是,如果你带着你所有的公义降临,你去对付那些压迫者,去对付那些行不义的人,他们就会像尘土一样在你面前。他们会崩溃。他们会像被风吹散的燃烧树枝。所以他们在说,当然,这就是第一到三节所说的。

在一个充满不公义的世界中,你怎么可能带着任何盼望生活,除非你相信一位愤怒的上帝?上帝对不公义发怒。所以这是第一点。第一点是,圣经中上帝的愤怒不像我们的愤怒通常那样。这不是暴躁。

这不是坏脾气。这不是自我。这不是爆发。这不是失控。这是一种稳定的、确定的、不可改变的、不可撤销的、不可腐蚀的对不公义和邪恶的反对。

以至于,没有债务会未付清。每笔账都会清算,没有人能逃脱任何事。这就是圣经所说的愤怒的上帝的意思。这就是我们所拥有的那种上帝。这就是圣经所呈现的。

现在马上就有反对意见。我知道。人们立即举手说,等一下。这其中的一个问题,为什么许多人,当然纽约市的大多数人认为这是一个原始的想法,是他们说,你知道吗?这种复仇的上帝的想法。

哦天哪,这很原始。我们必须超越这个,因为我们需要为一个和平的世界而努力。这种挥舞着剑的复仇上帝的想法。哦我的天。这会导致不宽容,最终导致暴力。

你真正需要的是,如果你要相信一位上帝,你必须相信一位接纳的上帝。你必须相信罪恶是旁观者眼中的事。你必须相信罪恶在某种程度上是一个视角问题。这种复仇上帝的想法。这只会导致暴力。

只会导致不宽容和暴力。最近我读了一本书,这是对那种极其普遍的信念——我们必须超越复仇的上帝才能拥有一个和平的世界——最有力的反驳之一。实际上这本书非常出色。在很多方面,这是一本由米罗斯拉夫·沃尔夫(Miroslav Volf)写的书,他是克罗地亚人,这本书的名字是《排斥与拥抱》(Exclusion and Embrace)。让我读给你听他的论点。

他在这本书中说,因为他是克罗地亚人,他在前南斯拉夫长大,他见过这段经文所写给的那些人——那些呼求复仇、因不公义而呼求的人——所见过的所有事情。他经历过这一切。这是他说的。非暴力的实践需要对神圣复仇的信仰。

我再说一遍,因为这,我的意思是,如果没有人扬起眉毛,你就没在听。非暴力的实践,好了,这样好些了。非暴力的实践需要对神圣复仇的信仰。他说,通往非暴力的唯一途径是相信一位对不公义发怒的上帝。如果没有愤怒的上帝,你永远走不出来。

你永远进入不了非暴力。你会被困在暴力的循环中。那么,他是如何提出这个观点的呢?嗯,就是这样。这是引文。

他说,我关于非暴力实践需要对神圣复仇的信仰的论点,会不受许多基督徒的欢迎,特别是在西方。但对于倾向于否定它的人,请想象一下。想象你在一个战区发表演讲,我就是在那里提交这一章作为论文的。在你的听众中是这样一些人,他们的城市和村庄首先被洗劫,然后被烧毁,然后被夷为平地,他们的女儿和姐妹被强奸,他们的父亲和兄弟被割喉。现在,你演讲的主题是基督徒对暴力的态度,论点是我们不应该报复,不应该被卷入持续暴力的循环。

我们不应该以牙还牙。为什么不呢?他说的是,暴力今天之所以盛行,是暗暗地被这样的信念滋养的:上帝拒绝拿起剑。然后他说,如果你这样做,如果你这样演讲,你很快就会发现,这个论点需要郊区的宁静才能诞生。人类的非暴力是一位拒绝审判的上帝的结果。

而一个浸透在无辜者鲜血中的被烤焦的人,这个想法必然会像自由主义思想的其他愉快囚禁一样死去。在一个暴力的世界里,如果上帝不挥舞宝剑,那就不配称为上帝。如果上帝不对不公义和欺骗发怒,不对暴力做最终了结,那位上帝就不配我们敬拜。现在,我能简单说明吗?这就是他的意思。

任何说复仇的上帝会导致暴力的人,自己实际上都不曾是暴力的受害者。你生活在一个美好的郊区小泡泡里,或者一个非常非常好的地区,你自己没有成为不公义的受害者。他说,当你是不公义的受害者时,你将不得不报复,除非你确信有一位复仇的上帝,有一位憎恨不公义的上帝,有一位对不公义发怒的上帝。有一位会清算每一笔账,使没有人能逃脱任何事的上帝,除非你相信神圣复仇的上帝,你将无法抗拒拿起剑,成为复仇者自己,否则你只会在绝望中死去。这就是为什么他能够回过头来说,正是非暴力的实践绝对需要对神圣复仇的信仰。

所以这是我们的第一点。你知道,人们说,我为什么需要一位愤怒的上帝?他说,如果没有对审判者的信仰,非暴力是不可能的。事实上,让我,让我再进一步说。如果你是,他所说的这些自由主义虔诚的受害者之一,你总是听说,我相信一位公义的上帝,那不会给世界带来和平。

那会导致更多暴力。他说,如果有人真的来对你做了什么坏事,你绝对会被卷入报复。实际上,你已经被卷入了。只是在许多情况下,你还没有真正有人攻击你,让你流血,杀死你,或者杀死你家人中的人。有人试图这样做。

他说,因为除非你相信一位复仇的上帝,否则你不会成为和平缔造者。你将无法在这个世界上过和平的生活。你将无法在这个世界上带着盼望生活。事实上,有一件事让我担心,如果我看着它,你们很多人,你们很多人确实生活在那个泡泡里,因为我们大多数人生活在一个比世界上其他任何地方、任何其他时代的大多数其他人都更安全、更快乐、更有保障的世界里。如果那个泡泡破裂,而你有一个不会对不公义施行复仇的软弱上帝,你要么会被卷入暴力,你将不得不自己报复,要么。

你会在绝望中死去。这是第一件事。你需要一位上帝。你需要一位愤怒的上帝,否则你将无法在一个不公义的世界中和平生活。其次,如果你要活在谦卑中,你需要一位愤怒的上帝。

现在,这是如此有趣的地方。让我们继续看接下来的三节。所有的注释家都说,看到第一段和第二段之间的讽刺关系是极其有趣的,第一段是第一到三节。我们刚刚读过。他们说的是,我们是不公义的受害者。

所以我们呼唤审判的上帝降临到这个世界。如果你只降临,让山岭震动,会发生什么?嗯,敌人,恶人,敌人,坏国家,他们会做什么?他们会被消灭。他们会变成尘土。他们会被消灭。

风会把他们吹走。但看这个。看,第二节说,在你面前,列国会战兢。但现在看,第四、五、六节,这是巨大的讽刺。现在是谁在战兢?

谁在衰残?看,第六节说,是谁像叶子一样战兢?像风一样,我们的罪把我们吹走。是他们。他们呼唤上帝降临所要做的事正发生在他们自己身上。

这就是我们所说的。顺便说一句,在这一点上,这是一个极其重要的小测试,可以知道你是否理解了你被教导的那个愤怒的上帝,或者你教导其他人的那个愤怒的上帝,也许有人在你成长过程中教导你关于这个的,或者也许你被教导其他人相信一位愤怒的上帝。和圣经中的愤怒上帝之间的区别,当你遇见圣经中的愤怒上帝时,你会发现,你会看到他们所看到的。你会从第一到三节中走出来。当你在第一到三节时,你在想的是,如果上帝降临,坏人会被审判。

但在第四到六节中,他们发现我们和其他任何人一样应该受审判,我们也在审判之下,我们完全应该受到和我们认为是邪恶作恶者的那些人一样多的惩罚。这绝对关键,这是知道你是否正在接触圣经中的上帝的重要测试之一。让我向你展示我的意思。世界上有两种人,他们似乎是对立的。世界上有两种人,那些把世界上每个人分成两种人的人,和那些不这样做的人。

你知道吗?嗯,我的意思是有两组非常突出的人。我不会说这里只有两种人。一方面,你有我们称之为宗教人士的人,传统宗教人士。他们当然相信有绝对的标准,有绝对的道德价值观,我们将被它们审判。

因此他们相信,如果上帝降临,祂会审判坏人。而那些有宗教信仰的人,他们说,嗯,我不背叛配偶,我关心家人,我遵守十诫,我去教会或犹太教堂,我施舍穷人,等等。我是个好人。所以你在第一到三节。你说,如果上帝降临,你看,坏人会被审判,他们对自己感觉很好。

另一方面,你有他们的死敌。我的意思是,在我们的社会中,死敌,所以那些相信传统道德价值观的人,是,你可能称之为世俗的人,进步的自由主义人士,他们说的是,你知道吗?每个人,罪恶是旁观者眼中的事。每个人都有自己定义罪恶的方式。对你来说是罪恶的,对我来说可能不是罪恶,我们必须做的是我们必须拥抱他们。

我们必须拥抱每个人。我们必须宽容每个人。我们必须接纳每个人。他们看起来非常非常宽容,除了他们同样在第一和第三节。因为他们说的是,是的,你知道,这个世界的问题是,那边所有不宽容的人。

我不像他们。你看,他们是宗教人士,他们是宗教人士,到处走来走去说,如果世界上每个人都像我一样,我们就不会有麻烦了。如果只是那边那些制造麻烦的人,如果有人能把他们击倒就好了。所以你看,你是宗教的还是非宗教的,你是保守的还是自由的,如果你活在第一、二、三节中,这真的没有关系。但基督徒会发生什么?

当他们最终接近并看到上帝真正是什么样子时,不可避免地,他们说的是,第六节,我们都像不洁净的人,我们所有的义行都像污秽的衣服。现在这是一个惊人的陈述。事实上,你知道,当你第一次读到它时,你会说,等等,什么?他没有说我们所有的罪都是污秽的衣服。当然,它们是污秽的衣服。

我们所有的义行,他不只是说义是一种笼统的东西,我们的义行是污秽的衣服。发生的事情是,一个基督徒已经开始透过外在看他或她自己的内心。开始看动机。这是你唯一可能说我的义行发臭的方式。我的意思是,一个义行怎么会发臭?

做正确的事怎么会发臭?怎么会在上帝的鼻孔里成为恶臭?嗯,答案是福音使你在看自己的内心时成为一种尼采式的人。你开始像尼采一样,当然,尼采总是看动机。尼采几乎发明了所谓的怀疑解释学。

向内看,说,是啊,是啊,是啊,是啊,是啊,你真的很好。你去教会,你做这个,你做那个。但为什么?为什么你,你对每个人说,我们应该爱每个人,但为什么你说每个人?你真正想做的不是你在试图压制人吗?

你在试图表现优越吗?你说,哦,我们应该顺服,应该非常有道德,但为什么?你真正想做的不是你在试图保持权力吗?你看,一个基督徒看自己的内心,这是基督徒所说的。基督徒是这样的人,他说,我意识到我犯罪的理由和我做好事的理由是一样的,而且都是错的。我不,即使当我做坏事时,我在试图做自己的主,但当我做好事时,我也是。

当我做坏事时,我在试图成为自己的救主,但当我做好事时,我在试图成为自己的救主。当我做好事时,我真的在试图让上帝按我的意思行事,我在试图控制祂。我在试图让祂欠我的。我在试图,你看,你能判断你的义是污秽衣服的方法之一。你们很多人都很有义。

我要感谢你们做了许多好事,但你们总是生气,因为上帝没有让你们的生活顺利。为什么会这样?你知道为什么吗?祂说,我过着非常好的生活,而我的嫂子或我的兄弟没有过着非常好的生活,我知道为什么我的生活这么糟糕?哇,哇,等一下,尼采说,等一下。

你为什么行善?试图让上帝按你的意愿行事。这就是罪的本质。我们到处看到破碎、战争、残酷和心痛。我们在周围的世界和自己的生活中感受到它。

事情怎么会变成这样?能做什么呢?在他本月发行的全新书中,《世界到底出了什么问题?》(What Is Wrong with the World?),提姆·凯勒提供了一个清晰而富有同情心的答案,该书取材于在救赎主教会的一系列教导。凯勒博士展示了罪的现实如何解释我们周围看到的痛苦,以及只有福音才能提供持久的自由和医治。无论你是被世界的状况所压倒,还是在与自己的错误或选择作斗争,或者在寻找盼望和喜乐,《世界到底出了什么问题?》都会帮助你看到福音如何既对我们世界的心痛说话,也对我们每个人内心的痛苦说话。这本新发行的书《世界到底出了什么问题?》是我们对你本月捐赠的感谢,以帮助"福音与生活"分享耶稣的好消息。今天就在 gospelandlife.com/give 索取你的副本。就是 gospelandlife.com/give。

这是罪的本质。每个人都按我的意愿行事。看,你知道,我的生命为了我的,不是我的生命为了你的。我们的意志交叉,我得偿所愿,你知道吗?你的义是污秽的衣服。

现在发生的是,除非你相信一位公义和审判的上帝,你来到那位上帝的面前,你永远不会谦卑。我告诉你,正是理解这一点的基督徒是最文明的人。我这是什么意思?除非你相信一位愤怒的上帝,否则你不会文明。你如何在纽约市这样的地方与所有这些如此不同的人生活在一起?

不同的信仰、不同的种族、不同的文化、不同的哲学、不同的宗教。你将如何?现在,有传统宗教价值观的人在城市生活中有巨大的困难。因为他们说,我有真理。我有真理。

因此,我对许多其他人感到如此优越。你不会成为好公民。你不会服侍他们。你不会坐下来把他们当作平等的人对待。你就是不会。

但如果你说,哦,我已经超越了那个,你看,我相信一切都是相对的。但你要做什么?你会对那些相信绝对价值观的人如此不安。你会,对吧,你会说,我比他们好得多。我讨厌那种人。

但等一下。你知道纽约市有多少人相信绝对价值观吗?看看所有的穆斯林。看看所有的正统犹太人。看,看所有的,你知道,看所有你是新教徒但他们是天主教徒的人,或者你是天主教徒但他们是新教徒的人,等等。

我想让你知道,除非你相信你应该受审判,否则你会是一个糟糕的邻居。你不会看着隔壁说,嘿,我和这个世界上任何作恶者一样应该受审判。因此,我不把自己看得比你优越。除非你有这个,你会是个糟糕的邻居。你不会文明地生活。

你也无法宽恕,因为你会把自己放在审判的位置上。你必须相信一位会清算所有账目的愤怒上帝的原因之一,是因为你们有些人现在正背负着巨大的负担。当你看到别人对你做了什么,事实上,当你看到生活对你做了什么,甚至上帝对你做了什么,你感到不安,因为你不明白为什么这会发生在我身上?你所做的是你没有一位愤怒的上帝。你把自己放在了法官的位置上。

你不相信一位真正会审判的上帝。这就是你无法宽恕的原因。如果你现在正在努力宽恕某人,那是因为你被困在第一、二或三节,第一、二、三节。你还没有到达第四到六节。如果你有困难,事实上,如果你甚至在努力理解为什么上帝让这个或那个发生。

如果你只是非常不安,因为上帝没有让这个发生,上帝没有让那个发生。这周,我想起了很久以前发生在我身上的一件事。对我的生活产生了很大的影响。我为什么今晚在这里?这个教会为什么在这里?

因为我的长老会教派派我来纽约。嗯,我为什么是长老会的?嗯,因为我在神学院的最后一个学期受到了一位特定老师的影响。我在研究生院的最后一个学期。他几乎是在最后才到那里的,你知道,在最后,但因为我受到他的影响,我成了长老会信徒,因此我被派到这里,因此我们在这里。

嗨,那么那个人为什么来到那所学校?嗯,你知道,他几乎没能成功,但他是,因为他是英国人,他遇到了签证问题。但国务院有人认识神学院的某个人,神学院的一个人走了些关系,他及时到达了。所以如果那个人没有走那些关系。他就不会到那里。

我就不会受他的影响。我就不会是长老会信徒。我就不会在这里。嗯,有人说这很有趣。为什么神学院的某人在国务院有权力?

嗯,神学院当时有一个叫迈克·福特(Mike Ford)的学生,他的父亲是当时的美国总统杰拉尔德·福特(Gerald Ford)。嗯,他父亲为什么?这就是他有影响力的原因。嗯,他父亲为什么是美国总统?嗯,因为尼克松辞职了。

嗯,尼克松为什么辞职?因为水门事件丑闻。嗯,为什么会有水门事件丑闻?因为水门大厦的两个窃贼有点搞砸了工作,因为其中一个忘了关门和锁上。一个夜班警卫注意到门是开着的,进来了,发现有入室行窃,等等,等等。

现在,重点是。如果那扇门没有被留开呢?我们就不会在这里。你就不会在这里。你敢认为你对自己生活中发生的事情了解得足够多以至于对上帝生气吗?

你知道这个和那个为什么会发生吗?你怎么可能处于审判者的位置?你为什么担心,因为你没有一位正在公正地安排一切的愤怒上帝?你为什么担心?你为什么不能宽恕?

你为什么不能在这个城市文明地生活,把其他人都看作平等的人,因为你没有一位愤怒的上帝?所以首先,如果你要活在盼望中,你需要一位愤怒的上帝。其次,如果你要活在谦卑中,你必须有一位愤怒的上帝,文明地,第三。最后,如果你真的要理解自己被爱有多深,你需要一位愤怒的上帝。现在,我知道这听起来最矛盾。

什么?你对上帝反对罪恶和邪恶的理解越愤怒,祂的忿怒越大,祂的公义越大,祂的审判越大,你越相信地狱,你理解这些真理的程度,你就会知道祂有多爱你。让我们继续往下看经文。首先,看,第8和9节,这里发生了一些非常有趣的事情,特别是这里的风格,第8节。然而,哦天父,你是我们的父,我们是泥,你是窑匠,我们都是你手的工作。

主啊,不要过度发怒,不要永远记念我们的罪。现在,你知道,这非常有趣。首先,上帝在这里被描述为父亲和艺术家,父亲和艺术家。看,因为首先,祂说,你是我们的父,那意味着我们是你的孩子,我们是祂的孩子,你是窑匠,这意味着祂是艺术家,我们是泥土,我们是艺术品。现在,首先,实际上从这节经文中得出了两件事。

首先,看,我们被告知的第一件事是,上帝的爱是祂愤怒的原因。因为注意,祂没有说,然而,主啊,你是我们的父,你是我们的艺术家,所以你不应该生气。那不是祂所说的。祂说,你不应该永远生气。你不应该过度生气。

过度,实际上,字面意思是到多得很,这和最终永远是一样的。回去。这教导我们的第一件事是,因为祂是父亲,因为祂是艺术家,祂的愤怒是有正当理由的。非常重要的是要看到,祂没有说,因为你是我们的父,你不应该生气。哦,不,一点也不。

父亲和艺术家会生气。哦天哪,他们会生气吗?有趣的是,这节经文,结合C.S.路易斯(C.S. Lewis)在《痛苦的奥秘》(The Problem of Pain)第3章中的这句名言,路易斯说,你要求一位慈爱的上帝?嗯,你有一位。

那位可怕外貌的伟大主爱你。不是一个昏昏欲睡地希望你以自己的方式快乐的衰老仁慈。不是一个有良知的法官的冷酷博爱,也不是一个以某种方式对客人的舒适感到负责的主人的关怀,而是那消耗的火焰本身。那爱,创造世界的爱,像艺术家对她作品的爱一样持久,像父亲对孩子的爱,像男人对妻子的爱一样不可改变和严格。现在,祂说的是什么?

我会说祂说的是什么。爱的对立面不是愤怒。哦,不,爱的对立面是恨,而终极的恨是冷漠。但看,当你热烈地恨某人时,你实际上给了他们相当多的关注。我的意思是,你把他们当作重要的人对待。

我的意思是,如果那还不算太糟,热烈地,终极的恨是不在乎。因此,如果上帝俯瞰这个世界,看到我们如何对待彼此,看到我们如何生活,看到我们如何对待祂,如果上帝看着这个世界而不发怒,祂就不是一位父亲,祂也不是一位艺术家,我们也不是祂的艺术品,我们也不是祂的孩子。如果上帝是一位,因为,正如路易斯在其他地方说的,愤怒是当你切开爱时它流出的血。如果有人真的爱你,而你搞砸了,你做了错事,那么你在搞砸,你在做很多坏事,那个人对你很生气。如果他们对你不生气,不管他们说什么,那只是感伤主义,他们不爱你。

因此,我们看到的,首先,非常重要的是,上帝的爱是愤怒的爱,是愤怒的爱怒。它们在一起,你必须相信两者。这就是我们正在努力做的。我们正在努力向你展示,它们实际上是同一枚硬币的两面。所以上帝的爱是祂愤怒的原因。

但我们在这里被告知的第二件事,这几乎是张力,上帝的爱不仅仅是祂愤怒的原因。上帝的爱也是祂愤怒的满足。这不仅仅是在这里我们被教导这是导致祂愤怒的爱。这也被暗示了,但它非常强烈。然而,因为你是父亲,你应该生气,但对你的愤怒做点什么。

不要永远生气。不要生气到多得很。不要最终生气。做点什么。有一个很有趣的地方,路易斯,C.S.路易斯正在给一个叫马尔科姆(Malcolm)的人写信,马尔科姆说,哦,我不喜欢这个愤怒的上帝的想法。我就是接受不了这个愤怒的上帝的想法。路易斯说了一些很有趣的话。他说,我亲爱的马尔科姆,想一想人与人之间最完全的和解。和平是通过道德说教恢复的吗?

或者如果说冒犯不重要,和平就能恢复吗?现在这很有趣,因为一方面,有道德主义和相对主义。有两种处理方式。假设有人做错了什么。你与某人不和解。

你不和解。你该怎么办?道德说教?或者,我猜谁能说你做的事是错的?道德主义还是相对主义?

不,听,他说的是什么。你应该做什么?如果不是道德主义和不是相对主义,愤怒。他说,想一想人与人之间最完全的和解。和平是通过道德说教恢复的吗?

或者冒犯不重要?你知道得更清楚。愤怒,不是小脾气,不是发脾气,而是公正的、慷慨的、烫人的义愤。这是会过去的愤怒,不一定一下子过去,但会过去转化为拥抱、欢欣、重新欢迎的爱的愤怒。这就是朋友和恋人真正和解的方式。

热烈的愤怒,然后热烈的爱。这样的愤怒是当你切开爱时它流出的液体。我知道他在说什么。所以可能是你,但你知道那有多罕见。因为通常,通常当有人得罪你时,你不生气,因为你不爱他们。

其他时候,你生气是因为你确实爱他们。但当你表达那种愤怒时,你对他们发火。你不知道如何用你的愤怒进行外科手术式的打击。路易斯所说的是,他说,一个道德说教,你把愤怒憋在心里,或者你试图把它吹掉,或者你耸耸肩,或者你放过它。那不管用。

这是管用的。当你进来,你表达你的愤怒,你说,我爱你。这就是我生气的原因。我讨厌你对自己所做的事,我讨厌你对我与你的关系所做的事。我再也不会忍受了。

我很生气。当你进行外科手术式的打击时,当你实际上把愤怒倾倒在罪上,当你把愤怒倾倒在邪恶上,当你把你的忿怒倾倒在罪本身上,让它使你与另一个人分离时。很多时候,那种愤怒就是真正唤醒这个人的东西。那种愤怒是最终让你们落入彼此怀抱的东西。哦是的。

热烈的。热烈的愤怒。热烈的爱。上帝确实做到了。我们知道祂做到了,因为记住我们的罪不再有了。

做点什么。你的爱是你愤怒的原因,但让你的爱成为你愤怒的满足。当然第17节说,是的,当然,祂说,我会重新创造你。我会改变你。我会不再记念你的罪。

祂是怎么做到的?嗯,这很简单,但在十字架上这很关键。我们上周读到过,在十字架上。上帝会成为一位公义的上帝,但不是一位愤怒的上帝,但不是爱吗?祂会惩罚我们,但然后祂失去我们,还是祂会爱我们然后不公义?

只有十字架发生了,只有十字架发生了。祂能同时是一位愤怒的爱和爱的愤怒的上帝吗?因为圣经所教导的就在这里。耶稣基督是那位被审判的审判者。

耶稣基督承受了所有的愤怒,所有的忿怒,承受了所有的不公义。它进入了祂的心,以至于当你相信祂时,对你来说什么都没有了。现在,祂不是在问你这个问题。现在,让我们回去。这就是重点。

你相信一位忿怒的上帝吗?啊,有人说,不,我不相信。我不,我相信上帝是爱的上帝。我不相信祂惩罚人。你的上帝爱你花了什么代价?

嗯,你说,我不知道,我猜什么都没花。嗯,那你怎么知道祂有多爱你?祂爱你。这就是为什么你对这个想法不感到兴奋的原因。这就是为什么你没有因为这个想法而改变生命的原因。这只是感伤主义。你相信公义的程度,你相信愤怒的程度,你相信地狱的程度,你就知道你对祂有多宝贵,因为祂付了代价。

如果你不相信地狱,如果你不相信惩罚,如果你不相信公义,如果你不相信审判,你不知道上帝为你做了什么。你不知道耶稣为你做了什么。你不知道你有多宝贵。

你不会走来走去充满对天的爱。你不会,你不会。这是你的错,因为你没有一位愤怒的上帝,因为你只是顺着每个人说的去做。不要这样做。

如果你知道祂为你做了什么,如果你知道对你来说没有审判了,那么当你像这样走在街上,这是每个人都会发生的,有什么东西来袭击你,你说,你称自己为好人。那个声音,那部分你这个可怜虫,在羞耻中退缩。耶稣说,来听我的爱,我承受了责备。你必须坐下来尝我的肉。所以我确实坐下来吃了,乔治·赫伯特(George Herbert)说。

但看,这是,你怎么知道祂爱你?你怎么知道祂有多爱你?你怎么走来走去充满爱?愤怒的上帝自己付了代价。现在看,让我们,让我们用这个来结束,就几个想法。

记得我在开头说的,除非你有一位既愤怒又充满爱的上帝,爱的愤怒和愤怒的爱,你的生活中会有扭曲。想一想这个和我一起。好的,让我们应用这个。你有一位只有爱的上帝吗?没有愤怒的爱。

你知道,爱,你有一位从不对你说不的上帝吗?圣经中有什么你不喜欢的,你说,我不能再相信那个了?因此你没有一位能反驳你的上帝。你没有一位能对你说不的上帝。你没有一位实际上做任何事情,但总是接纳你的上帝。

那意味着你没有上帝。你有的,只是你自己。你就是这样的人。试着这样养育一个孩子。试着养育一个你从不反驳的孩子。

你从不违背他们的意愿。你从不管教他们。你从不训诫他们。你从不对他们说不。这样养育一个孩子。

听着,虐待的父母很糟糕。放任的父母同样糟糕。这样长大的孩子感觉像孤儿,他们确实是。而那些成长于一个只是爱他们并在各方面接纳他们的上帝观念的人,他们在属灵上长大感觉像孤儿,他们确实是。你知道,你说,你知道,你有一位没有愤怒的爱的上帝。

你真的没有上帝。但另一方面,你有一位愤怒的上帝,但不是爱的上帝,一位标准的上帝,一位公义的上帝?这行不通。你的生活不会奏效。你知道,在路加福音16章末尾有一个很有趣的地方,一个关于拉撒路和财主的著名比喻。有一个地方,亚伯拉罕称呼他,原谅我。

财主在地狱里,他向亚伯拉罕呼求说,父亚伯拉罕,如果我知道地狱,你知道,我就不会那样生活了。所以我的兄弟们还活着。你能不能请派人从死里复活去告诉他们这个地方?这样他们就会审判他们的生活。亚伯拉罕说什么?

这还不够。你说,什么?有人从死里回来说,停下,你知道,就像马利的鬼魂(Marley's ghost)。哦,停下,请遵守十诫。

否则你就会像我一样。那还不够。对史克鲁奇(Scrooge)来说够了。那是虚构的。那是虚构的。

我是一名牧师。我见过很多人向一位愤怒的上帝许诺。他们感觉像被困住时的承诺,他们感觉像,哦,我最好做点什么,否则上帝会惩罚我。它们从不奏效,因为恐惧不能唤醒你内心的爱。只有爱才能唤醒你内心的爱。

如果你只有一位愤怒的上帝,看,如果你有一位没有愤怒的爱的上帝,你什么都没有。但如果你有一位没有爱的愤怒的上帝,你有一些东西,它会压垮你。你会是一个被驱使的人。你永远无法达到。你会一直像逃命一样,却没有人追赶。

你会像涂在太多面包上的一点黄油一样薄。当保罗说,基督的爱激励我,他在想耶稣基督和上帝的忿怒,那使他成为一个有勇气的人。它融化了他的心。它也能为你做同样的事。如果你从未把你的生命交给这位上帝,你知道这意味着什么吗?

祂的愤怒正在你的生命中作工。什么?是的,把你驱赶进祂的爱的怀抱,因为这就是祂的愤怒一直在追求的。所以,继续前进。让我们祷告。

我们的父,我祈祷,如果今晚这里有任何人对愤怒的上帝的想法感到不安,我祈祷他们会思考而不只是反应。父啊,对我们许多人来说,我们在理智上相信你是一位公义和审判的上帝,但我们还没有想清楚这意味着什么。我们祈祷你会给我们更多的平安。你会给我们更多的文明、更多的谦卑和更大的被爱的感受,我们的被爱性。我们祈求你今晚帮助我们通过你圣灵的大能做到这一点。

我们感谢你,主,你是这样的一位上帝。我们奉耶稣的名祷告。阿们。

---

今天，我们越来越相信一个有爱和良善的上帝，祂更加接纳人。这就是其中的要点。我不知道。我当时就在那里。我的意思是，我在八年级、九年级时就有这样的想法。

但我要说的是，圣经中的三位一体的神，圣经向我们呈现的那位愤怒的上帝。是的，我们已经失去了，但我们在社会和文化中已经失去了与祂的联系。我在这里告诉你们，这是一件坏事。事实上，我要说得更进一步。你需要一位愤怒的上帝。

你需要在你的头脑和内心中有一位对罪恶感到愤怒的上帝。你需要一位愤怒的上帝才能活在希望中。你需要一位愤怒的上帝才能活在谦卑中，你需要一位愤怒的上帝才能知道你被多么深地爱着。如果你不相信一位愤怒的上帝，一位真正憎恨罪恶并将要惩罚它的愤怒的上帝，你就是在使自己贫乏。你正在夺走各种希望、谦卑和爱。

这就是我要告诉你们的。你知道，你说，这是如何运作的呢？好吧，让我们开始。首先，基本上你只需要按照经文逐步理解。首先，第一到第三节告诉我们，你需要一位愤怒的上帝，圣经中的愤怒的上帝，才能活在希望中。

才能在一个破碎的世界中活在希望中。当你研究这些书卷，比如以赛亚书时，容易忽略的一件事是，实际上，旧约的大部分内容都有一个历史背景。它们不仅仅是作为论文而写的。它们不是讲座。它们是在一个历史情境中写成的。

每个人都同意，以赛亚书第四十章及其后续章节是写给一个面临流亡的国家，写给以色列的，他们面临着巨大的不公正，他们将要面临，或者确实面临过，或者当他们读到这些时已经面临过。他们的首都耶路撒冷被摧毁。他们自己的孩子被屠杀。去读读诗篇137篇。他们的婴儿，他们婴儿的小脑袋被胜利者摔在石头上。

被掳、被锁链捆绑、可怕的不公正。那么他们在做什么呢？好的，我们在第一到第三节中看到，他们在请求上帝降临并审判这不公正。他们在说，哦，愿你裂天而降。群山

会在你面前战栗。

正如火点燃树枝，烈焰降下，要使你的名为你的仇敌所知，并使列国震颤。他们真正在说的是，如果你带着你所有的公义降临，你追讨那些压迫者，你追讨那些制造不公的人，他们在你面前就像尘土一样。他们会崩溃瓦解。他们会像被风吹散的燃烧树枝。所以他们在说，当然，这就是第一到第三节所颂扬的。

在一个充满不公的世界里，你怎么可能怀有任何希望，除非你相信一位会愤怒的上帝？上帝对不公义感到愤怒。所以这是第一点。第一点是，圣经中上帝的愤怒通常不像我们的愤怒。它不是暴躁。

它不是坏脾气。它不是自我。它不是爆发。它不是失控。它是一种坚定的、固定的、不可平息的、不可撤销的、不可腐化的对不公义和邪恶的对立。

这样，没有任何债务会不被偿还。每一笔账都会算清，没有人能逃脱什么。这就是圣经所说的有一位愤怒的上帝的意思。这就是我们所拥有的那种上帝。这就是圣经所呈现的。

现在马上就有反对意见。我知道。马上，人们立即举起手说，等一下。这其中的一个问题，许多人，当然纽约市的大多数人认为这是一个原始的想法的原因之一，是他们说，你知道吗？这个复仇之神的想法。

哦，天哪，这太原始了。我们必须超越这一点，因为我们需要为一个和平的世界而努力。这个挥舞刀剑的复仇之神的想法。哦，天哪。这会导致不宽容，最终导致暴力。

你真正需要的是，如果你要相信一个上帝，你需要相信一个接纳的上帝。你必须相信罪是见仁见智的。你必须相信罪在某种程度上是一个视角问题。这个复仇之神的想法。这只会导致暴力。

只会导致不宽容和暴力。嗯，最近我读了一本书，它是对这种极端观点最有力的反驳之一

我们必须超越一个复仇之神的观念，才能拥有一个和平的世界，这是一个普遍的信念。实际上，这是一本令人难以置信的书。在许多方面，这是一本由米罗斯拉夫·沃尔夫撰写的书，他是克罗地亚人，这本书的名字叫《排斥与拥抱》。让我读给你听他的论点。

他在这本书中说，因为他是克罗地亚人，在前南斯拉夫长大，他见证了所有那些这段经文所写给的人们所经历的事情，那些为复仇呐喊、为不公呐喊的人们。他见证了这一切。他经历过这些。这是他所说的话。非暴力的实践需要对神圣复仇的信念。

我再说一遍，因为这真的，我是说，如果没有人扬起眉毛，说明你没有在听。非暴力的实践需要，对了，这样好些。非暴力的实践需要对神圣复仇的信念。他说，通向非暴力的唯一途径是相信一位对不公义感到愤怒的神。没有一位愤怒的神，你永远走不出来。

你永远无法进入非暴力。你会被困在暴力的循环中。那么，他是如何论证这一点的呢？嗯，就是这样。这是引文。

他说，我的论点——非暴力的实践需要对神圣复仇的信念——将不受许多基督徒的欢迎，尤其是在西方。但对于倾向于驳斥它的人，请想象一下。想象你在一个战区发表演讲，我就是在那里将这一章作为论文发表的。在你的听众中，有些人的城市和村庄首先被掠夺，然后被烧毁，然后被夷为平地，他们的女儿和姐妹被强奸，他们的父亲和兄弟被割喉。现在，你的演讲主题是基督徒对暴力的态度，论点是我们不应该报复，不应该被卷入持续暴力的循环中。

我们不应该以牙还牙。为什么不呢？这是他所说的，暴力在今天蔓延，暗中被神拒绝拿起刀剑的信念所滋养。然后他说，如果你这样做，如果你这样演讲，你很快就会发现，这个论点的诞生需要郊区的宁静。人类

非暴力是拒绝审判的上帝的结果。

对于一个被无辜者鲜血浸透的愤怒之人来说，这个观念必然会像自由主义思想的其他美好俘虏一样消亡。在一个充满暴力的世界里，如果上帝不挥动宝剑，祂就不配称为上帝。如果上帝不对不公和欺骗感到愤怒，不最终终结暴力，那样的上帝就不配得我们的敬拜。现在，让我简单概括一下吗？这就是他所说的。

任何说复仇之神会导致暴力的人，实际上自己并没有成为暴力的受害者。你生活在一个美好的郊区小泡泡里，或者一个非常、非常好的地区，在那里你自己并没有成为不公正的受害者。他说，当你成为不公正的受害者时，除非你确信有一位复仇的上帝，有一位憎恨不公的上帝，有一位对不公义感到愤怒的上帝，有一位将清算每一笔账、让没有人能逃脱的上帝，否则你将不得不自己报复，除非你相信神圣复仇的上帝，你将无法抵抗拿起剑成为复仇者的冲动，否则你就只能绝望而死。这就是为什么他能够回过头来说，正是非暴力的实践绝对需要相信神圣的复仇。

所以这是我们的第一点。你知道，人们说，我为什么需要一个愤怒的上帝？他说，没有对审判者的信仰，非暴力是不可能的。事实上，让我，让我，让我更进一步。如果你是他所说的这些自由主义虔诚观念的受害者，你总是听说，我相信一个公义的上帝，那不会给世界带来和平。

那会导致更多的暴力。他说，你绝对会，如果有人真的来对你做了坏事，你会立刻陷入报复之中。实际上，你已经陷入了。只是在很多情况下，你还没有真正遇到有人实际攻击你、让你流血、杀死你或杀死你家人的情况。有人试图这样做吗？

他说，因为除非你相信一位

复仇，你就不会成为一个和平缔造者。你将无法在世界上过一种和平的生活。你将无法在世界上过一种充满希望的生活。事实上，如果我观察一下，有一件事让我担忧，你们中的许多人，你们中的许多人确实生活在那个泡泡中，因为我们大多数人生活在一个比世界上其他任何地方或历史上任何其他时期的大多数人都要安全、快乐和有保障得多的世界里。如果那个泡泡破裂了，而你有一个对不公义不施报应的软弱无力的上帝，你要么会被卷入暴力之中，不得不自己去报复，要么。

你会在绝望中死去。这是第一件事。你需要一位上帝。你需要一位愤怒的上帝，否则你将无法在一个不公正的世界中平安地生活。其次，如果你要活在谦卑中，你需要一位愤怒的上帝。

现在，这就是如此引人入胜的地方。让我们直接进入接下来的三节经文。所有注释家都说，看到第一段和第二段之间的讽刺性关系是极其有趣的，第一段是第一到第三节。我们刚刚读过它。他们所说的是，我们是不公义的受害者。

因此我们向世界呼求审判的上帝。如果你愿意降临并使山岭震动，会发生什么？嗯，敌人，那些邪恶的人，敌人，那些坏国家，他们会做什么呢，他们会被消灭。他们会变成尘土。他们会被吞噬。

风会把他们吹走。但请看这一点。看，第二节，万国都要在你面前战兢。但现在看，第四、五、六节，这就是极大的讽刺。现在是谁在颤抖？

是谁在衰残？看，第六节，是谁像叶子一样颤抖？我们的罪孽如风将我们吹去。是他们。他们呼求上帝降下来做的正是发生在他们身上的事。

这就是我们所说的。顺便说一下，此时，这是一个极其重要的小测验，用来检验你是否理解了也许你被教导的、或者你教导别人的那种愤怒的上帝，也许某人

在你成长过程中教导你这些，或者也许你被教导其他人相信一个愤怒的上帝。而当你遇见圣经中愤怒的上帝时，你会发现并且会明白他们所看到的。你会从第一到三节中得出这个结论。当你在第一到三节时，你所想的是如果上帝降临，坏人会受到审判。

但在第四到六节中，他们发现我们和其他任何人一样应当受到审判，我们也同样在审判之下，我们也绝对和那些我们认为是邪恶作恶者的人一样应受惩罚。这一点至关重要，这是检验你是否正在接触圣经中的上帝的一个重要标准。让我向你展示我的意思。世界上有两种人，他们看起来是对立的。世界上有两种人，一种是把世界上所有人分为两种人的人，另一种是不这样做的人。

你知道吗？好吧，我的意思是有两类非常突出的人群。我不会说这里只有两种人。一方面，有我们称之为宗教人士的人，传统的宗教人士。他们当然相信有绝对的标准，有绝对的道德价值观，我们将被这些标准审判。

因此他们相信如果上帝降临，祂会审判坏人。那些有宗教信仰的人说，好吧，我不欺骗我的配偶，我关心我的家庭，我遵守十诫，我去教堂或犹太教堂，我施舍穷人，等等。我是个好人。所以你在第一到三节中。你说，如果上帝降临，你看，坏人会受到审判，他们对自己感觉相当良好。

另一方面，你会遇到他们的对立面。我是说，在我们的社会中，这个对立面，所以那些相信传统道德价值观的人，你可以称之为世俗人士，进步的自由派人士，他们说的是，你知道吗？每个人，罪是旁观者眼中的罪。每个人都有自己定义罪的方式。什么

对你来说是罪的，对我来说可能不是罪，我们要做的就是必须拥抱他们。

我们必须拥抱每个人。我们必须容忍每个人。我们必须接纳每个人。他们看起来非常非常宽容，但他们也同样陷于第一节和第三节中。因为他们所说的是，是的，你知道，这个世界的问题就在于那些不宽容的人。

我不像他们。你看，他们是宗教人士，而宗教人士都四处走动说，如果世界上每个人都像我一样，我们就不会有麻烦了。如果那些制造麻烦的人，如果有人能把他们打倒就好了。所以你看，无论你是宗教的还是非宗教的，无论你是保守派还是自由派，如果你活在第一、二、三节中，其实都没什么区别。但基督徒会发生什么呢？

当他们最终接近并看到神真正的样子时，不可避免地，他们会说第六节的话：我们都像不洁净的人，我们所有的义行都像污秽的衣服。这是一个令人震惊的陈述。事实上，你知道，当你第一次读到这段话时，你会说，等等，什么？他并没有说我们所有的罪都是污秽的衣服。当然，它们是污秽的衣服。

他说的是我们所有的义行，而且他不只是说义是一种笼统的东西，我们的义行是污秽的衣服。发生的情况是，一个基督徒已经开始透过外在看进自己的内心深处。开始审视动机。这是你能说出"我的义行很臭"的唯一方式。我的意思是，一个义行怎么可能是臭的呢？

做正确的事怎么可能是臭的呢？怎么可能在神的鼻孔中是一种恶臭呢？嗯，答案是当你审视自己的内心时，福音把你变成了一种尼采式的人。尼采当然总是在审视动机。尼采几乎发明了所谓的诠释学怀疑。

向内审视并说，是啊，是啊，是啊，是啊，是啊，你真的很好。你去教会，你做这个，你做那个。但为什么？为什么？你对每个人说，我们应该爱每个人，但你为什么要这样说呢？

所有人？你真正试图做的不是你试图压制人们吗？

你是在试图显示优越吗？你说，哦，我们应该顺服，应该非常有道德，但你为什么不是真的试图保持权力呢？你看，一个基督徒审视我你自己的心，而基督徒在说的是这样的。基督徒是这样一个人，他说，我，我意识到我犯罪的原因和我行善的原因是一样的，而且都是错的。我不，即使当我做坏事时，我试图成为我自己的主，但当我做好事时，我也是如此。

当我做坏事时，我试图成为我自己的救主，但当我做好事时，我也试图成为我自己的救主。当我做好事时，我实际上是试图让神按我的意思行事，我试图控制他。我试图让他欠我的。我试图，你看，你能判断你的义是污秽的衣服的方法之一。你们很多人都很公义。

我要感谢你做了许多好事，但你总是愤怒，因为神没有让你的生活顺利进行。那是为什么呢？你知道为什么吗？他说，我过着非常好的生活，而我的嫂子没有过着非常好的生活，我不知道为什么我的生活会如此糟糕？哇，哇，等一下，尼采说，等一下。

你为什么要行善？试图让神按你的意愿行事。那就是罪的本质。我们无论看向何处，都看到破碎、战争、残酷和心痛。我们在周围的世界和自己的生活中都感受到它。

它是如何变成这样的？对此能做些什么？在他本月发行的全新著作《这个世界出了什么问题？》中，提姆·凯勒提供了一个清晰而富有同情心的答案，这本书源自他在救赎主教会的一系列教导。凯勒博士展示了罪的现实如何解释我们周围看到的痛苦，以及为什么只有福音才能提供持久的自由和医治。无论你是被我们世界的状况所压倒，还是在与自己的错误或选择挣扎，或是在寻找希望和喜乐，《这个世界出了什么问题？》都将帮助你看到福音如何既回应我们世界的心痛，也回应我们每个人内心的痛苦。这本新发行的书，《什么是

错误的世界，感谢你们本月的奉献，帮助福音生命分享耶稣的好消息。今天就在 gospelandlife.com-slash-give 申请你的副本。那是 gospelandlife.com-slash-give。

这就是罪的本质。每个人都按我的意愿行事。看，你知道的，是你的生命为我的生命服务，而不是我的生命为你的服务。我们的意愿相冲突，我得到我想要的，你知道吗？你的义就像污秽的破布。

现在是这样的，除非你相信一位施行审判和公义的上帝，并且来到那位上帝面前，否则你永远不会谦卑。我告诉你，正是那些理解这一点的基督徒才是最有礼貌的人。我这话是什么意思呢？除非你相信一位愤怒的上帝，否则你不会有礼貌。你将如何在像纽约市这样的地方生活，与所有这些如此不同的人相处？

不同的信仰、不同的种族、不同的文化、不同的哲学、不同的宗教。你将如何做？现在，拥有传统宗教价值观的人在城市生活中会遇到巨大的困难。因为他们说，我拥有真理。我得到了真理。

因此，我对其他许多人感到如此优越。你不会成为好公民。你不会服务他们。你不会坐下来平等地对待他们。你就是做不到。

但如果你说，哦，我超越了那个，你看，我相信一切都是相对的。但你会怎么做？你会对那些相信绝对价值观的人感到如此不安。你会，对吧，你会说，我比他们好多了。我讨厌那种人。

但等一下。你知道在纽约市有多少人相信绝对价值观吗？看看所有的穆斯林。看看所有的正统犹太人。看，看看所有的，你知道，看看所有你们这些新教徒眼中的天主教徒，或者你们天主教徒眼中的新教徒等等。

我想让你知道，除非你相信你应得审判，否则你会成为一个糟糕的邻居。你不会看向隔壁然后说，嘿，我和这个世界上任何作恶者一样应得审判。因此，我不会把自己看得比你优越。除非你

拥有那个,你可能会成为一个糟糕的邻居。你不会文明地生活。

你也无法宽恕,因为你会把自己置于审判的位置。你必须相信一位愤怒的上帝会清算所有账目的原因之一,是因为你们中的一些人现在正承受着巨大的负担。当你看到别人对你做了什么,事实上,当你看到生活对你做了什么,甚至上帝为你对你做了什么,你感到不安,因为你不明白为什么那会发生在我身上?你所做的就是你没有一个愤怒的上帝。你把自己置于法官的位置。

你不相信一个真正会审判的上帝。这就是你无法宽恕的原因。如果你现在难以宽恕某人,那是因为你被困在第一、二或三节,一、二、三节。你还没有到达第四到六节。如果你有困难,事实上,如果你甚至难以理解为什么上帝让这个或那个发生。

如果你只是非常不安,因为上帝没有让这个发生,上帝没有让那个发生。这周,我想起了很久以前发生在我身上的一件事。我的生活产生了重大影响。为什么我今晚在这里?为什么这个教会在这里?

因为我的长老会教派派我去纽约。那么,我为什么是长老会的?嗯,因为我在神学院最后一个学期受到了一位特定老师的影响。我研究生院的最后一个学期。他刚到那里不久,因为,你知道,就在最后,但因为我受到了他的影响,我成为了长老会成员,因此我被派到这里,因此我们在这里。

嗨,那么为什么那个人来到那所学校?嗯,你知道,他差点就没来成,但他来了,因为他是英国人,他遇到了签证问题。但国务院有人认识神学院的某个人,神学院的一个人动用了一些关系,他及时到达了。所以如果那个人没有动用那些关系,他就不会到那里。

我就不会受到他的影响。我就不会成为长老会成员。我就不会在这里。那么,

有人说这很有趣。为什么神学院的某个人在国务院有影响力？

嗯，当时神学院有一个学生叫迈克·福特，他的父亲是杰拉尔德·福特，那时是美国总统。那么，为什么他的父亲？这就是为什么他有这种关系。那么，为什么他的父亲是美国总统呢？嗯，因为尼克松辞职了。

那么，尼克松为什么辞职？因为水门事件丑闻。那么，为什么会有水门事件丑闻？因为水门大厦的两个窃贼搞砸了工作，因为其中一个忘记关门并锁上门闩。一个夜班保安注意到门是开着的，走进来，发现有人入室盗窃，等等，等等。

现在，重点来了。如果那扇门没有被敞开呢？我们就不会在这里。你就不会在这里。你敢认为自己对生活中发生的事情了解得足够多，可以因此对上帝生气吗？

你知道为什么会发生这样那样的事情吗？你怎么可能有资格成为审判者？为什么你会担心，因为你没有一位愤怒的上帝在公正地安排一切？你为什么担心？你为什么不能宽恕？

你为什么不能文明地生活在这个城市里，把其他每个人都看作平等的人，因为你没有一位愤怒的上帝？所以首先，如果你要活在希望中，你需要一位愤怒的上帝。其次，如果你要活在谦卑中，你必须有一位愤怒的上帝；再次，要文明地生活。最后，如果你真的要理解自己被爱的程度，你需要一位愤怒的上帝。现在，我知道这听起来最矛盾。

什么？你越理解上帝对罪恶和邪恶的愤怒，祂的愤怒越大，祂的公义越大，祂的审判越大，你越相信地狱，当你掌握这些真理的程度，你就会知道祂有多爱你。让我们继续看经文。首先，看第8和第9节，这里发生了一些非常有趣的事情，特别是第8节的斯特格利。然而，啊父啊，你是我们的父，我们是泥土，你是窑匠，我们都是你手的工作。

不要过度愤怒，啊主啊，不要

不会永远记住我们的罪。你知道,这是非常有趣的。首先,上帝在这里被描述为一位父亲和一位艺术家,一位父亲和一位艺术家。看,因为首先,他说,你是我们的父亲,这意味着我们是你的孩子,我们是他的孩子,而你是窑匠,这意味着他是艺术家,我们是泥土,我们是艺术品。现在,首先,实际上从这节经文中得出了两件事。

首先,你看,我们被告知的第一件事是,上帝的爱是他愤怒的原因。因为注意,他没有说,然而,主啊,你是我们的父亲,你是我们的艺术家,所以你不应该愤怒。他不是这么说的。他说的是,你不应该永远愤怒。你不应该过度愤怒。

过度,实际上,字面意思是到达极多,这与最终的永远是一样的。回头看。这教导我们的第一件事是,因为他是父亲,因为他是艺术家,他的愤怒是正当的。非常重要的是要看到,他没有说,因为你是我们的父亲,你不应该愤怒。哦,不,完全不是这样。

父亲和艺术家会愤怒。哦,天哪,他们确实会愤怒吗?非常有趣的是,这节经文,结合鲁益师在《痛苦的奥秘》第三章中的这句名言,鲁益师说:你要求一位慈爱的上帝?好吧,你已经有一位了。

这位有着可怕面貌的伟大主爱你。不是一种昏昏欲睡地希望你以自己的方式快乐的衰老仁慈。不是一位有良知的法官的冷漠慈善,也不是一位以某种方式对客人的舒适感到负责的主人的关怀,而是那焚烧的火本身。那创造世界的爱,如同艺术家对其作品的爱那样持久,如同父亲对孩子的爱,如同男人对妻子的爱那样不可改变和苛求。现在,他在说什么?

我来说他在说什么。爱的反面不是愤怒。哦,不,爱的反面是恨,而最极端的恨是冷漠。但你看,当你激情地恨某人时,你实际上给了他们相当多的关注。我的意思是,你把他们当作重要的人。

我的意思是,如果这还不算太糟的话,那激情地,最极端的恨是不在乎。而

因此，如果上帝俯瞰这个世界，看到我们如何彼此相待，看到我们如何生活，看到我们如何对待他，如果上帝俯瞰这个世界却不感到愤怒，那么他就不是一位父亲，也不是一位艺术家，而我们也不是他的作品，也不是他的孩子。如果上帝是一位，因为，正如路易斯在其他地方所说，愤怒是爱被割伤时所流出的血。如果有人真正爱你，而你却在搞砸一切，做错事情，你在搞砸，做很多坏事，那个人会对你感到愤怒。如果他们对你不感到愤怒，无论他们说什么都不重要，那只是感伤主义，他们并不爱你。

因此，我们首先看到的，这非常重要，就是上帝的爱是充满愤怒的爱，是愤怒的挚爱之怒。它们是结合在一起的，你必须同时相信两者。这就是我们试图要做的。我们试图向你展示它们实际上是同一枚硬币的两面。所以上帝的爱是他愤怒的原因。

但我们在这里被告知的第二件事，这几乎是一种张力，上帝的爱不仅是他愤怒的原因。上帝的爱也是他愤怒的满足。这里不仅在教导我们这是导致他愤怒的爱。它也在暗示，而且非常强烈。然而因为你的父亲，你应该愤怒，但要对你的愤怒做点什么。

不要永远愤怒。不要过度愤怒。不要最终还在愤怒。做点什么。有一个很有趣的地方，路易斯，C.S.

路易斯在给一个叫马尔科姆的人写信，马尔科姆说，哦，我不喜欢愤怒的上帝这个概念。我就是无法接受愤怒的上帝这个想法。路易斯说了一些很有趣的话。他说，我亲爱的马尔科姆，想想人与人之间最完全的和解。和平是通过道德说教恢复的吗？

或者和平是在说冒犯不重要的情况下恢复的吗？这相当有趣，因为一方面，有道德主义，有相对主义。有两种处理方式。假设有人做错了事。你和某人没有和解。

你们没有和解。你该怎么做？道德说教？或者，哦，我想谁说得清呢

你所做的是否错了？道德主义是相对的吗？

不，听着，他说了什么。你应该做什么？如果不是道德主义也不是相对主义，而是愤怒。他说，想想人与人之间最完全的和解。和平是通过道德说教来恢复的吗？

还是说冒犯无关紧要？你更清楚。愤怒，不是暴躁，不是发脾气，而是慷慨的、灼热的义愤。这种愤怒会消退，不一定是立刻消退，但愤怒会转化为拥抱、欢欣和重新欢迎的爱。这就是朋友和爱人真正和解的方式。

炽热的愤怒，然后是炽热的爱。这样的愤怒是爱在被割伤时流出的液体。我知道他在说什么。你可能也知道，但你知道这有多罕见。因为通常，通常当有人得罪你时，你不生气是因为你不爱他们。

其他时候，你生气是因为你确实爱他们。但当你表达那种愤怒时，你对他们大发雷霆。你不知道如何用你的愤怒进行精准打击。刘易斯说的是，他说，一个道德说教，你把愤怒压抑下来，或者试图把它发泄掉，或者你耸耸肩把它抛开，或者你把它忽略过去。那是行不通的。

以下是有效的方法。当你走进来时，你表达你的愤怒，然后说，我爱你。这就是我生气的原因。我恨你对自己所做的，我恨你对我与你关系所做的。我不会再忍受这种情况了。

我很生气。当你进行精准打击时，当你真正把愤怒放在罪上时，当你把愤怒放在邪恶上时，当你把你的愤怒倾倒在罪本身上时，它使你远离那个人。很多时候，那种愤怒才是真正唤醒人的东西。那种愤怒最终会让你们拥抱在一起。哦，是的。

炽热的。炽热的愤怒。炽热的爱。上帝确实这样做了。我们知道他做到了，因为他不再记念我们的罪。

做点什么吧。你的爱是你愤怒的原因，但让你的爱成为你愤怒的满足。当然，第17节说，是的，当然，他说，我会重新创造你。我会改变你。我会不再记念你的罪。

他是怎么做到的？嗯，这很简单，但这很关键，在

十字架。我们上周读到了关于十字架的内容。上帝会是一位公义的上帝，却不是一位充满愤怒的上帝吗？他会不爱我们吗？他会惩罚我们，然后失去我们吗？还是他会爱我们，然后不公义呢？

只有当十字架发生，只有当十字架发生时。他才能既是一位带着愤怒之爱的上帝，又是一位带着慈爱之怒的上帝吗？同时兼具这一切。因为圣经教导的就是这些。耶稣基督是那位被审判的审判者。

耶稣基督承受了所有的愤怒，所有的烈怒，为了所有的不义。这一切都进入了他的心中，以至于当你相信他时，就没有什么留给你了。现在，他不会问你这个问题。现在，让我们回去。这就是重点。

你相信一位充满愤怒的上帝吗？啊，有人说，不，我不相信。我不相信，我相信上帝是一位慈爱的上帝。我不相信他会惩罚人。那么你的上帝爱你付出了什么代价呢？

嗯，你说，我不知道，我猜什么都没有。那么，你怎么知道他有多爱你呢？他爱你。这就是为什么你对这个想法不感到激动的原因。

这就是为什么这个想法没有改变你的生命的原因。这只是感伤主义。在你相信公义、相信愤怒、相信地狱的程度上，你才知道你对他来说有多么宝贵，因为他付出了这个代价。如果你不相信地狱，如果你不相信惩罚，如果你不相信公义，如果你不相信审判，你就不知道上帝为你做了什么。你不知道耶稣为你做了什么。

你不知道你有多么宝贵。你不会充满爱意地走在街上。你不会，你不会。这是你的错，因为你没有一位愤怒的上帝，因为你只是随波逐流，听从每个人的说法。不要这样做。

如果你知道他为你做了什么，如果你知道没有审判留给你了，那么当你走在街上时，就像每个人都会遇到的那样，有些东西来袭击你，你说，你还称自己是个好人。那个声音，那个可怜的你，退却在羞耻中。耶稣说，来听我的爱，我承担了责备。你必须坐下来品尝我的肉。所以我坐下来吃了，乔治·赫伯特这样写道。

但是看，这里是什么，你怎么知道他

爱你呢?你怎么知道他有多爱你?你如何带着满满的爱四处行走?一位愤怒的上帝,却亲自付上了代价。现在看,让我们,让我们用这个来总结,就几点思考。

记得我在开头说的,除非你有一位既有烈怒又有慈爱的上帝,充满爱的烈怒和充满怒气的爱,否则你的生命中会有扭曲。让我们一起思考一下这个问题。好的,让我们应用一下这个。你有一位只有爱的上帝吗?没有愤怒的爱。

你知道,爱,你有一位从不对你说"不"的上帝吗?圣经里有任何你不喜欢的东西你就说,为什么我不能再相信那个了?因此你没有一位能反驳你的上帝。你没有一位能对你说"不"的上帝。你没有一位真正做任何事的上帝,只是总是接纳你。

这意味着你没有上帝。你有的,只是你自己。而你是这样的。试着那样养育一个孩子。试着养育一个你从不反驳他们的孩子。

你从不违背他们的意愿。你从不责备他们。你从不管教他们。你从不对他们说不。那样养育一个孩子。

听着,虐待孩子的父母很糟糕。放任的父母同样糟糕。那样长大的孩子感觉像孤儿,而他们确实是。那些在一个只是爱他们、以各种方式接纳他们的上帝观念中长大的人,他们在属灵上感觉像孤儿,而他们确实是。你知道,你说,你知道,你有一位只有爱而没有烈怒的上帝。你并没有真正拥有上帝。但另一方面,你有一位愤怒的上帝却不是慈爱的上帝,一位标准的上帝,一位公义的上帝吗?这行不通。你的生命行不通。你知道,在路加福音16章结尾处,那个非常著名的拉撒路和财主的比喻,这很有意思。

有一个地方,亚伯拉罕叫他,哦不对。财主在地狱里,他向亚伯拉罕呼喊说,父亚伯拉罕,如果我知道地狱的事,你知道,我就不会那样生活了。所以我的弟兄们还活着。你能不能派人从死里复活去告诉他们这个地方?这样他们就会审视自己的生命。

亚伯拉罕说什么呢?这还不够。你说,什么?

有人从死里复活说，停下来，你知道的，这就像马利的鬼魂。哦，停下来，请遵守思考的修正案。

否则你就会像我一样。那还不够。对斯克鲁奇来说那已经足够了。那是虚构的。那是虚构的。

我是一位牧师。我见过太多人向一位愤怒的上帝做出承诺。当他们感到被困住时做出的承诺，当他们觉得，哦，我最好做点什么，否则上帝会惩罚我时做出的承诺。这些承诺从来都不管用，因为恐惧无法唤醒你心中的爱。只有爱才能唤醒你心中的爱。

如果你只有一位愤怒的家伙，看，如果你有一位没有烈怒的慈爱上帝，你什么都没有。但如果你有一位没有爱的烈怒上帝，你有了些东西，但它会压垮你。你会成为一个被驱使的人。你永远无法达标。你总是在奔逃，却没有人追赶。

你会像一点点黄油涂抹在太多面包上。当保罗说，基督的爱激励我时，他想到的是耶稣基督承受了上帝的愤怒，这使他成为一个有勇气的人。这融化了他的心。它也能为你做同样的事。如果你从未将生命交托给这位上帝，你知道那意味着什么吗？

祂的愤怒正在你的生命中运行。什么？是的，是为了驱使你进入祂爱的怀抱，因为这就是祂的愤怒一直追求的目标。所以，继续吧。让我们祷告。

我们的父，我祷告如果今晚这里有任何人对一位愤怒的上帝感到不安，我祈求他们能思考而不只是反应。父啊，对我们许多人来说，我们在理智上相信你是一位公义和审判的上帝，但我们还没有思考这意味着什么。我们祈求你赐给我们更多的平安。你会赐给我们更多的文明、更多的谦卑和对我们的爱、我们可爱之处更深的认识。我们祈求你今晚借着圣灵的能力帮助我们做到这一点。

我们感谢你，主，你是这样一位上帝。我们奉耶稣的名祷告。阿们。
