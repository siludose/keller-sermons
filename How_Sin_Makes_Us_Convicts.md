### Introduction: The Problem of Sin

Why is the world so broken? And why are we capable of inflicting such harm even toward those we love? People point to politics, poverty, or psychology, but none of these fully explain what we see in ourselves and in history. This month on the podcast, Tim Keller is teaching from a series exploring the question, what's wrong with us? Knowing us how the Bible's teaching on sin offers the only explanation deep enough to face the truth in all its complexity, and the only hope powerfully enough to transform us.

> Isaiah 64, verses 1 to 9, and then it skips on down near the latter part of this long passage, Isaiah 65, 17 to 18.

So read 1 to 9, and 17 to 18. Oh, that you would rent the heavens and come down, that the mountains would tremble before you, as when the fire sets twigs ablaze and causes water to boil, come down to make your name known to your enemies, and cause the nations to quake before you. For when you did awesome things that we did not expect, you came down and the mountains trembled before you, since ancient times no one has heard, no eye has perceived, no one has heard, no ear has perceived, no eye has seen any God besides you, who acts on behalf of those who wait for him. You come to the help of those who gladly do right, who remember your ways, but when we continue to sin against them, you were angry. How then can we be saved? All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags. We all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away, no one calls on your name, or strives to lay hold of you, for you have hidden your face from us, and made us waste away because of our sins. Yet, O Lord, you are our Father, we are the clay, you are the potter, we are all the work of your hand, do not be angry beyond measure, O Lord, do not remember our sins forever, oh, look upon us, we pray, for we are all your people. Behold, I will create new heavens, and a new earth. The former things will not be remembered, nor will they come to mind, but be glad and rejoice forever in what I will create, for God will create Jerusalem to be a delight, and it is people to be a joy, this is God's word.

### Part 1: The Necessity of an Angry God

Now, what we are doing is we are looking in a series on what the Bible says about sin, and we have been digging into the Hebrew Bible in particular, and actually into Isaiah in particular, and tonight, we come to the most unpopular part of what the Bible teaches about sin, and what I am about to tell you, what I am about to tell you, and I have asked the ushers to borrow the doors, so that you stay for at least the first point, after hearing the very, very galling and unpalatable introduction to the sermon. What this is teaching is that God is an angry God. God gets angry, look, verse 5, you are angry at us, verse 9, don't be angry at us. The Bible is presenting to us a God who gets angry at sin.

**You need an angry God to live with hope.** You need an angry God to live with humility and you need an angry God to know how loved you are. And if you don't believe in an angry God, a really angry God who hates sin and is going to punish it, you're impoverishing yourself. You're taking away all sorts of hope and humility and love. That's what I'm here to tell you.

#### 1. Living in Hope

First of all, verses one to three tell us that you need an angry God, the biblical angry God, to live in hope. To be able to live in hope in a broken world. One of the things that's easy to miss when you study these books like Isaiah, in fact, big parts of the Old Testament, is that they have a historical situation. They were not just written as essays. They weren't lectures. They were written into a historical situation. And everybody agrees that Isaiah chapter 40 and following after chapter 40 was written to a nation to Israel that was facing exile, that was facing tremendous injustice, that was going to face or did face or had faced when they read this. Their capital city Jerusalem torn down. Their own children slaughtered. Go read about it in Psalm 137. Their infants, their little heads of their infant dashed against the rock by the victors. Captivity, chains, terrible injustice.

> "Oh, that you would rent the heavens and come down, that the mountains would tremble before you."

### Part 2: Living with Humility

#### 1. Recognizing Our Own Sin

Now, here's what's so intriguing. Let's move right on to the next three verses. All the commentators say it is extremely interesting to see the ironic relationship between the first and second stanza, the first stanza is verses one to three. We just read it. What they're saying is, we are the victims of injustice. And so we call down into the world the God of judgment. If you would only come down and make the mountains shake, what would happen? Well, the enemies, the wicked people, the enemies, the bad nations, what they would do is they would just, they would be consumed. They would become dust. They'd become consumed. And they would, the wind would blow them away. But get this. See, before you, verse two, the nations would quake before you. But now look, verses four, five, and six, here's the great irony. Who's tripling up now? Who is wasting away? See, who is tripling up like a leaf, verse six? And like the wind, our sins sweep us away. They are. The very thing they call God down to do is happening to them.

**All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are filthy rags.**

### Part 3: Understanding God's Love

#### 1. God's Love and Anger

Now, I know this sounds the most contradictory. What? The angrier you understand God to be against sin and evil, the greater His wrath, the greater His justice, the greater His judgment, the more you believe in hell, to the degree that you grasp those truths, to that degree you'll know how much He loves you.

> "Yet, O Father, you are our Father, we are the clay, you are the potter, we are all the work of your hand."

First of all, God is characterized here as a Father and as an artist, a Father and an artist. See, because first of all, he says, you are our Father, that means us your children, us his children, and you are the potter, which means he's the artist and we are the clay, we're the aren't work.

**God's love is the cause of his anger.** Because notice, he doesn't say, yet, O Lord, you are our Father and you are our artist, so you shouldn't be angry. That's not what he says. He said, you shouldn't be angry forever. You shouldn't be angry beyond measure. Beyond measure, actually, it literally means unto muchness, which is the same as ultimately forever.

> "The opposite of love is not anger. Oh, no, the opposite of love is hate, and the ultimate hate is indifference."

### Conclusion

If you know what he did for you, if you know there's no judgment left for you, then when you're walking on the street like this happens to everybody and something comes along and hits you and you say, you call yourself a good person. That voice, the part you wretch, retreat and shame. And Jesus says, come hear my love, I bore the blame. You must sit down and taste my meat. So I did sit and eat at George Herbert. But look, here's what, how do you know he loves you? How do you know how much he loves you? How do you walk around filling love? Angry God who paid the penalty himself.

Let's pray. Our Father, I pray if there's anybody here tonight who's certainly upset with the idea of an angry God, I pray that they would think and not just react. Father, for many of us, we have the intellectual belief that you're a God of justice and judgment, but we haven't thought out what the implications of that are. We pray that you would give us more peace. You would give us more civility, more humility and a greater sense of our love, our loveness. And we ask that you would help us do that tonight by the power of your Holy Spirit. We thank you, Lord, that you're a God like this. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.

### 引言：罪的问题

为什么世界如此破碎？为什么我们甚至能够对我们所爱的人造成如此大的伤害？人们指向政治、贫困或心理学，但这些都无法完全解释我们在自己和历史中所看到的。这个月的播客中，Tim Keller 正在从一个系列中讲解这个问题：我们出了什么问题？圣经关于罪的教导提供了唯一足够深刻的解释来面对真相的复杂性，并提供了唯一足够强大的希望来改变我们。

> 以赛亚书 64:1-9，然后跳到这段长经文的后半部分，以赛亚书 65:17-18。

所以读 1 到 9 节，以及 17 到 18 节。哦，愿你裂天而降，山岭在你面前震动，正如火焰点燃树枝并使水沸腾，降临使你的名被敌人知晓，使列国在你面前战栗。因为当你做我们意想不到的奇妙事情时，你降临，山岭在你面前震动，自古以来没有人听见，没有耳朵听见，没有眼睛看见，除了你之外，没有神为那些等候他的人行事。你来帮助那些乐意行义、记念你道的人，但当我们继续犯罪时，你就发怒。我们怎么能得救呢？我们都像不洁净的人，我们所有的义行都像污秽的衣服。我们都像叶子一样枯萎，像风一样我们的罪把我们吹走，没有人呼求你的名，或努力抓住你，因为你掩面不顾我们，使我们因罪孽消耗殆尽。然而，主啊，你是我们的父亲，我们是泥土，你是陶匠，我们都是你手中的工作。主啊，不要过度发怒，不要永远记住我们的罪，哦，求你看顾我们，因为我们都是你的子民。看哪，我要创造新天新地。先前的事不再被记念，也不再进入心中，但要因我所创造的永远欢喜快乐，因为神要创造耶路撒冷成为喜乐，它的子民成为欢乐，这是神的话。

### 第一部分：愤怒的神的必要性

现在，我们正在研究圣经关于罪的教导，我们特别深入研究了希伯来圣经，实际上特别是以赛亚书，今晚，我们来到圣经关于罪的教导中最不受欢迎的部分，我将告诉你们，我已经请了招待员锁上门，以便你们至少听到第一个要点，听完这个非常令人不快的讲道介绍。这个教导是说神是一个愤怒的神。神会生气，看，第5节，你对我们生气，第9节，不要对我们生气。圣经向我们展示了一个对罪愤怒的神。

**你需要一个愤怒的神来活在希望中。** 你需要一个愤怒的神来活在谦卑中，你需要一个愤怒的神来知道你有多被爱。如果你不相信一个愤怒的神，一个真正愤怒的神，恨罪并将惩罚它，你是在贫穷自己。你正在剥夺各种希望、谦卑和爱。这就是我要告诉你的。

#### 1. 活在希望中

首先，第一到三节告诉我们，你需要一个愤怒的神，圣经中的愤怒的神，来活在希望中。在一个破碎的世界中能够活在希望中。当你研究这些书籍时，比如以赛亚书，实际上是旧约的大部分内容，它们有一个历史背景。它们不仅仅是作为文章写的。它们不是讲座。它们是写在一个历史背景中的。所有人都同意，以赛亚书第40章及其后的内容是写给一个面临流亡的国家以色列的，他们面临着巨大的不公正，他们将要面对或已经面对或曾经面对过，当他们读到这段经文时。他们的首都耶路撒冷被摧毁。他们自己的孩子被屠杀。去读诗篇137篇。他们的婴儿，他们的小婴儿的头被胜利者砸在岩石上。被俘，锁链，极大的不公正。

> "哦，愿你裂天而降，山岭在你面前震动。"

### 第二部分：谦卑地生活

#### 1. 认识到我们自己的罪

现在，这里有什么令人着迷的。让我们直接进入接下来的三节。所有的评论家都说，看到第一和第二节之间的讽刺关系是极其有趣的，第一节是第一到三节。我们刚刚读过。他们在说，我们是不公正的受害者。因此，我们呼求世界中的审判之神。如果你能下来并使山岭震动，会发生什么？好吧，敌人，邪恶的人，敌人，坏的国家，他们会被消灭。他们会变成尘土。他们会被消灭。风会把他们吹走。但看看这个。看，第2节，列国会在你面前战栗。但现在看，第4、5、6节，这里是伟大的讽刺。现在是谁在枯萎？谁在消耗殆尽？看，第6节，谁像叶子一样枯萎？像风一样，我们的罪把我们吹走。他们是。正是他们呼求神来做的事情正在发生在他们身上。

**我们都像不洁净的人，我们所有的义行都像污秽的衣服。**

### 第三部分：理解神的爱

#### 1. 神的爱与愤怒

现在，我知道这听起来最矛盾。什么？你越理解神对罪和邪恶的愤怒，他的愤怒越大，他的公义越大，他的审判越大，你越相信地狱，越能理解这些真理，你就越能知道他有多爱你。

> "然而，父啊，你是我们的父亲，我们是泥土，你是陶匠，我们都是你手中的工作。"

首先，神在这里被描绘为父亲和艺术家，父亲和艺术家。因为首先，他说，你是我们的父亲，这意味着我们是他的孩子，我们是他的孩子，而你是陶匠，这意味着他是艺术家，我们是泥土，我们是他的作品。

**神的爱是他愤怒的原因。** 因为注意，他没有说，因为你是我们的父亲，你不应该生气。这不是他说的。他说，你不应该永远生气。你不应该过度生气。过度生气，实际上，它字面意思是过度的意思，与最终永远相同。

> "爱的对立面不是愤怒。哦，不，爱的对立面是恨，而最终的恨是冷漠。"

### 结论

如果你知道他为你做了什么，如果你知道没有审判留给你，那么当你像这样走在街上，这种情况发生在每个人身上，有些东西过来打击你，你说，你称自己为好人。那个声音，你这个可怜的家伙，退缩并感到羞耻。耶稣说，来听我的爱，我承担了责任。你必须坐下来品尝我的肉。所以我坐下来吃了乔治·赫伯特的东西。但看，这是什么，怎么知道他爱你？你怎么知道他有多爱你？你怎么走在街上感到被爱？愤怒的神亲自承担了惩罚。

让我们祷告。我们的父亲，我祈祷如果今晚这里有任何人对愤怒的神的想法感到不安，我祈祷他们会思考而不仅仅是反应。父亲，对于我们中的许多人，我们有智力上的信仰，你是一个公正和审判的神，但我们没有思考出这意味着什么。我们祈祷你会给我们更多的平安。你会给我们更多的文明，更多的谦卑和更大的爱，我们请求你今晚通过圣灵的力量帮助我们做到这一点。我们感谢你，主，你是这样的神。我们奉耶稣的名祷告。阿门。
