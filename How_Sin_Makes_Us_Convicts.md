## English Transcript / 英文原文

today, more and more, we believe in a loving and good God who's more accepting of  people. And that's the gist of it. I don't know. I was there. I mean, I had that in eighth  grade, ninth grade.

But here's what I'm going to say, the biblical and three God, the angry  God that's presented to us by the Bible. Yeah, we have lost, but yet we have lost connection  with it in our society and our culture. And I'm here to tell you, it's a bad thing. In fact,  I'll go this far. You need an angry God.

You need in your mind and in your heart a God  that gets angry at sin. You need an angry God to live with hope. You need an angry God  to live with humility and you need an angry God to know how loved you are. And if you don't  believe in an angry God, a really angry God who hates sin and is going to punish it,  you're impoverishing yourself. You're taking away all sorts of hope and humility and love.

That's what I'm here to tell you. And you know, you say, how does that work out? Well, okay,  let's go. First of all, and basically you just work right through the text on this. First of all,  verses one to three tell us that you need an angry God, the biblical angry God, to live in hope.

To be able to live in hope in a broken world. One of the things that's easy to miss when you  studies these books like Aziz, in fact, big parts of the Old Testament, is that they have a historical  situation. They were not just written as essays. They weren't lectures. They were written  into a historical situation.

And everybody agrees that Isaiah chapter 40 and following after chapter  40 was written to a nation to Israel that was facing exile, that was facing tremendous injustice,  that was going to face or did face or had faced when they read this. Their capital city drew  some torn down. Their own children slaughtered. Go read about it in Psalm 137. Their infants,  their little heads of their infant stashed against the rock by the victors.

Captivity,  chains, terrible injustice. And so what are they doing? Well, we see in verses one to three,  they're asking God to come down and judge the injustice. They're saying, oh, well,  you would run the heavens and come down. The mountains would tremble before you.

As when fire sets, twigs of blaze come down to make your name known to your enemies and cause  the nations to quake. And what they're really saying is, if you came down with all your justice and  you went after the oppressors and you went after the perpetrators of injustice, they would be like  dust before you. They would crumble. They would be like burning twigs that the wind drives away. And so they're saying, of course, this is what verses one to three sang.

How in the world could  you possibly live in a world filled with injustice with any hope at all, unless you believed in a  and angry God? God gets angry in injustice. And so here's the first point. First point is the  God's anger in the Bible is not like our anger usually is. It's not crankiness.

It's not ill  temper. It's not ego. It's not it's not explosion. It's not out of control. It's a settled, fixed,  implacable, irrevocable, incorruptible, opposition to injustice and evil.

So that,  no debt will go unpaid. Every account will be squared and nobody will get away with anything. And that's what the Bible means when it says there's an angry God. That's the kind of God  that we have. That's what the Bible presents.

Now right away, objection. I know. Right away,  people immediately put up their hands and say, wait a minute. One of the problems with that,  one of the reasons why many people, most people in New York City certainly believe that that's a  primitive idea is they say, you know what? This idea of a God of vengeance.

Oh my, it's primitive. We've got to get beyond that because we need to work for a peaceful world. This idea of a vengeful  God who bears the sword. Oh my work. That leads to intolerance and eventually the violence.

What you really need is you need to believe in an accepting God if you're going to believe in a God. You have to believe that sin is in the eye of the beholder. You have to believe that sin is sort of  a matter of perspective. This idea of a God of vengeance. That's going to lead to nothing but  violence.

Nothing but intolerance and violence. Well recently I read a book that is one of the most  powerful refutations of that extremely common belief that we have to get beyond a God of vengeance  if we're going to have a world of peace. Incredible book actually. In many ways, it's a book by  written by Miroslav Wolf, whose Croatian and the name of the book is exclusion and embrace. And let me read you his thesis.

He says in this book, because his Croatian, he was raised in  the former Yugoslavia, he has seen all the stuff the people who this passage was written to,  who are crying out for vengeance and crying out because of the injustice. He's seen all that. He's been through that. And this is what he says. The practice of nonviolence requires a belief  in divine vengeance.

I'll say that again because it just, I mean, if nobody's eyebrows are raised,  you're not listening. The practice of, there we go, that's better. The practice of nonviolence  requires a belief in divine vengeance. He says, the only way to nonviolence is to believe in a God  who gets angry at injustice. Without an angry God, you'll never get out.

You'll never get into  nonviolence. You'll be stuck in the cycle of violence. Now, how does he make that point? Well,  here it is. Here's the quote.

And he says, my thesis that the practice of nonviolence requires a  belief in divine vengeance will be unpopular with many Christians, especially in the West. But to the person inclined to dismiss it, please imagine something. Imagine you're delivering  a lecture in a war zone where I delivered this chapter as a paper. And among your listeners are  people whose cities and villages have first been plundered, then burned, and then leveled to the ground,  whose daughters and sisters have been raped, and whose fathers and brothers have had their  throat slit. Now, the topic of your lecture is a Christian attitude toward violence,  and the thesis is we should not retaliate and be sucked into the cycle of continued violence.

We should not pay back. Why not? And here's what he says, violence thrives today, secretly nourished  by the belief that God refuses to take the sword. And then he says, if you do this, if you lecture  like this, soon you will discover that it takes the quiet of a suburb for the birth of the thesis. The human nonviolence is the result of a God who refuses to judge.

And a scorch man soaked in  the blood of innocent, of the innocent, the idea will invariably die like other pleasant  captivity of a liberal mind. In a world of violence, it would not be worthy of God not to wield the  sword. If God were not angry at injustice and deception, did not take a final end of violence,  that guy would not be worthy of our worship. Now, can I put it in a nutshell? Here's what he's saying.

Anybody who says that a God of vengeance will lead to violence has not actually been a victim  of violence themselves. You live in a nice suburban little bubble, or a very, very nice area where  you haven't yourself been the victim of injustice. He says, when you're the victim of injustice,  you will have to pay back unless you're assured that there is a God of vengeance, that there is a  God who hates injustice, that there's a God who's angry with injustice. And a God who's going to settle  every account so that nobody gets away with anything, unless you believe in a God of divine vengeance,  you will not be able to resist picking up the sword and being, you know, being the avenger yourself,  or else you'll just die at a spare. That's the reason why he's able to come back and say it's  the practice of non-violence that absolutely requires a belief in divine vengeance.

And so here's  our first point. You know, people say, why do I need an angry God? He says non-violence is impossible  without belief in a judge. In fact, let me, let me, let me go, let me press a little further. If  you are, what he calls the victim of one of these liberal piety's, you've always heard of,  I believe in a God of justice, that would not lead to peace in the world.

That would lead to more  violence. He says, you will be absolutely, if anybody ever comes and actually does something bad to  you, you will be sucked right into pay back. Actually, you've been already. He just haven't had,  maybe in many cases, you haven't had actually, somebody actually attack you and draw blood or kill  you or kill, or kill people in that your family. And anybody tried to do that.

He says, because  unless you believe in a God of vengeance, you will not be a peacemaker. You will not be able to  live a life of peace in the world. You will not be able to live a life of hope in the world. In fact, one thing that worries about me, if I look out at it, many of you, many of you do live in  that bubble because most of us live in a world far more safe and far more happy and far more secure  than most other people who have lived anywhere else in the world or anywhere in any other time in  history. And if that bubble should break and you have a nambi-pambi God who does not wreak  vengeance on injustice, you will either get sucked into the violence you will have to pay back yourself  or else.

You'll die in despair. That's the first thing. You need a God. You need an angry God  where you won't be able to live in peace in an unjust world. Secondly, you need an angry God  if you're going to live in humility.

Now, here's what's so intriguing. Let's move right on to the  next three verses. All the commentators say it is extremely interesting to see the ironic  relationship between the first and second stanza, the first stanza is verses one to three. We just  read it. What they're saying is, we are the victims of injustice.

And so we call down into the world  the God of judgment. If you would only come down and make the mountains shake, what would happen? Well, the enemies, the wicked people, the enemies, the bad nations, what they would do is they  would just, they would be consumed. They would become dust. They'd become consumed.

And they would,  the wind would blow them away. But get this. See, before you, verse two, the nations would quake  before you. But now look, verses four, five, and six, here's the great irony. Who's tripling up now?

Who is wasting away? See, who is tripling up like a leaf, verse six? And like the wind, our sins sweep us away. They are. The very thing they call God down  to do is happening to them.

And this is what we were saying. And this is, at this point, by the way,  this is an extremely important little test to know whether or not you're understanding the difference  between the angry God that maybe you were taught about, or you taught other people, maybe  somebody taught you about this as you were growing up, or maybe you were taught other people  believed in an angry God. And the angry God of the Bible, when you meet the angry God of the  Bible, you will find out and you will come to see what they see. You'll get out of verses one to  three. When you're in one to three, what you're thinking is if God would come down, the bad people  would be judged.

But in verses four to six, they find out that we deserve as much judgment as  anybody else, that we too are under judgment, that we too absolutely deserve punishment as much  as those people that we thought were the wicked perpetrators. That's absolutely critical,  and this is one of the great tests to know whether or not you're getting in touch with the  biblical God. Let me show you what I mean. There's two kinds of people in the world that seem to  be opposites. There's two kinds of people in the world, those who divide everybody in the world,  in the two kinds of people, and those who don't.

Did you know that? Well, I meant there's two  groups of people that are very prominent. I wouldn't say there's only two kinds of people here. On the one hand, you've got people we would call religious people, traditionally religious. And they certainly believe that there are absolute standards, and that there are absolute moral values,  and that we're going to be judged by them.

And therefore they believe that if God were to come down,  He would judge the bad people. And people who are religious, they say, well, I don't cheat on my  spouse, and I go to my family, and I obey the Ten Commandments, and I go to church, or synagogue,  and I give to the poor, and so on. I'm a good person. And so you're in versus one to three. You say,  if God were to come down, you see, the bad people would be judged, and they feel pretty good about  themselves.

On the other hand, you've got their nemesis. I mean, in our society, the nemesis,  so that people believe in traditional moral values, are, you might call this secular people,  progressive liberal people, and what they say is, you know what? Everybody,  sin is in the eye of the beholder. Everybody's got their own way of defining sin. What sinful for  you wouldn't be sinful for me, and what we have to do is we have to embrace them.

We have to embrace  everybody. We have to tolerate everybody. We have to accept everybody. And they look very, very  tolerant, except they're just as much in versus one and three. Because what they are saying is,  yes, you know, what the trouble with this world is, is all those people over there who are in tolerant.

I'm not like them. You see, they're religious people, and they're religious people,  are all walking around saying, if only everybody in the world was like me, we wouldn't be in trouble. If only those people over there that are causing the trouble, if somebody would just knock them down. And so you see, it really doesn't matter whether you're religious or religious, whether you're  conservative or liberal, if you live in versus one, two, and three. But what happens to Christians?

When they finally get close and to see what God really is like, inevitably, what they say is,  verse six, all of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are filthy  rags. Now that is a stunning statement. In fact, you know, when you first read through it, you say,  wait, what? He didn't say all our sins are his filthy rags. Of course, they're filthy rags.

All our righteous, and he's not just saying righteousness is just a sort of a general thing,  our righteous deeds are filthy rags. What happens is a Christian has begun to look past the  externals into his or her own heart. Start looking at motivations. That's the only way you can possibly  say that my righteous deed stinks. I mean, how could a righteous deed stink?

How could doing the  right thing stink? How could be a stench in God's nostrils? Well, the answer is the gospel  turns you into a kind of Nietzschean person when you look at your own heart. You begin Nietzsche,  of course, was always looking at motives. Nietzsche is almost invented what's called the Hermann  Unix's suspicion.

Looking inside and saying, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're real good. You  go to church, you do this, you do that. But why? Why do you, you say to everybody, we should love  everybody, but why do you say everybody? What aren't you really trying to do is you're trying to keep  people down?

Are you trying to be superior? You say, oh, we should obey and should be very moral,  but why aren't you really trying to stay in power? You see, a Christian looks at my your own heart,  and here's what the Christian is saying. Christian is somebody who says, I become, I come to realize that  the reason for my sins and the reason for my good deeds is the same and it's wrong. I don't, even when I do a bad deed, I'm trying to be my own Lord, but when I do a good deed,  I am too.

When I do a bad deed, I'm trying to be my own Savior, but when I do a good deed,  I'm trying to be my own Savior. When I do good deeds, I'm really trying to get God to do right  by me, and I'm trying to control him. I'm trying to put him in my debt. I'm trying to, you see, one of the ways you can tell your righteousness is a filthy rag. A lot of you  are very righteous.

I'm going to thank you to do many good things, but you're always angry because  God's not letting your life go right. Why is that? You know why? He said, I've lived this very good  life and my sister-in-law is not living a very good life for my brother, and I know why is my  life going so bad? Whoa, whoa, wait a minute, Nietzsche says, wait a minute.

Why were you being good? Trying to get God to do your will. That's the essence of sin. Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache. We feel it in the world  around us and in our own lives.

How did it get this way? And what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing this month, What Is Wrong with the World? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer, drawing from a series of teachings given  at Redeemer. Dr.

Keller shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us,  and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes or choices,  or looking for hope and joy, What Is Wrong with the World will help you see how the gospel  speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us. This newly released book,  What Is Wrong with the World is our thanks for your gift this month to help gospel in life share  the good news of Jesus.

It's very essence of sin. Everybody does my will. See, you know, you're a life for mine,  not my life for yours. Our wills cross, I get my way, you know? Your righteousness is a filthy  rag.

Now here's what goes on, unless you believe in a God of judgment and justice and you come into  the presence of that God, you're never going to be humbled. I'll tell you, and it's Christians who  understand this who are the most civil people. What do I mean by that? Unless you believe in an  angry God, you won't be civil. How are you going to live in a place like New York City with all these  people that are so different?

Different beliefs, different races, different cultures, different  philosophies, different religions. How are you going to be? Now, people with traditional religious  values have a tremendous, a trouble living in a city. Because they say, I've got the truth. I got the truth.

And therefore, I feel so superior to so many of these other people. You're not  going to be good citizens. You're not going to serve them. You're not going to sit down and treat them  as equals. You're just not.

But if you say, oh, I passed that, you see, I believe everything is  relative. But what are you going to do? You're going to be so upset with people who believe in absolute  values. You're going to, right, you're going to say, I'm so much better than they are. I hate those  kinds of people.

But wait a minute. Do you know how many people believe in absolute values in  New York City? Look at all the Muslims. Look at all the Orthodox Jews. See, look at all the,  you know, look at all the people of your Protestant who are Catholic, or your Catholic who are Protestant  and so forth.

I want you to know that unless you believe that you deserve judgment, you're going  to be a lousy neighbor. You're not going to look out next door and say, hey, I deserve as much  judgment as any perpetrator in this world. And therefore, I don't look at myself as superior to you. Unless you have that, you can be a lousy neighbor. You're not going to live civilly.

You're also not  going to be able to forgive because you're going to put yourself in judgment. One of the reasons why  you have to believe in an angry God who's going to square all accounts is because there's a  tremendous burden that some of you are carrying right now. When you look at what other people have  done to you, in fact, when you look and see what life is done to you, or even what God has done  for you to you, and you get upset because you don't understand why did that happen to me? What  you've done is you don't have an angry God. You're putting yourself in the shoes of a judge.

You don't believe in a God who really is going to judge. And that's the reason why you can't  forgive. If you're having trouble forgiving somebody right now, it's because you're stuck in  verses one, two or three, one, two, three. You haven't gotten a verses four to six yet. If you're having trouble, in fact, if you're having trouble even understanding why God  let this or that happen.

If you're just so upset because God didn't let this happen, God didn't let  that happen. This week, I was reminded of something that happened me a long time ago. I had a big  impact on my life. Why am I here tonight? Why is this church here?

Because my Presbyterian  denomination sent me to New York. Well, why was I Presbyterian? Well, because I fell in the  influence of a particular teacher my last semester and seminary. My last semester in graduate school. And he just got there barely because, you know, at the very end, but because I fell under his  influence, I became a Presbyterian therefore I was sent here and therefore we're here.

Hi, so why did that person come to that school? Well, you know, he almost didn't make it,  but he was, because he was British and he was having visa problems. But somebody in the state  department knew somebody at the seminary and a person in the seminary pulled some strings and he  got there just in time. So that person hadn't pulled those strings. He wouldn't have gotten there.

I wouldn't have come to his influence. I wouldn't have been Presbyterian. I wouldn't be here. Well, somebody says that's interesting. Why did somebody at the seminary have power the state  department?

Well, there was a student at the seminary then named Mike Ford whose father was Gerald  Ford who was the president of the United States at the time. Well, why was his father? That's why he had  cool. Well, why was his father president of the United States? Well, because Nixon resigned.

Well, why did Nixon resign? Because of the Watergate scandal. Well, why was there a Watergate  scandal? Because two burglars at the Watergate building kind of botched the job because one of them  forgot to close the door and latch it. And a night watchman noticed that the door was open, came in,  discovered that there was a burglary and et cetera, et cetera.

Now, here's the point. What if that door  hadn't been left open? We wouldn't be here. You wouldn't be here. Do you dare think you ever know  enough about what's going on in your life to be mad at God for it?

Do you know why this and that  happens? How could you ever be in a position to be the judge? Why are you worried because you don't  have an angry God who's working everything out justly? Why are you worried? Why can't you forgive?

Why can't you live in this city, civilly looking at everybody else as an equal because you don't have  an angry God? So first of all, you need an angry God if you're going to live in hope. Secondly,  you've got to have an angry God if you're going to live in humility, civility, thirdly. And lastly,  you need an angry God if you're really going to understand how loved you are. Now, I know this sounds the most contradictory.

What? The angrier you understand God to be against  sin and evil, the greater His wrath, the greater His justice, the greater His judgment, the more you  believe in hell, to the degree that you grasp those truths, to that degree you'll know how much  He loves you. Let's move right on down through the text. First of all, look, verses 8 and 9,  something very interesting happens here, especially the Stegelic here, verse 8. Yet, O Father,  you are our Father, we are the clay, you are the potter, we are all the work of your hand.

Do not  be angry beyond measure, O Lord, do not remember our sins forever. Now, you know, this is very interesting. First of all, God is characterized here as a Father and as an artist, a Father and an artist. See, because first of all, he says, you are our Father, that means us your children,  us his children, and you are the potter, which means he's the artist and we are the clay, we're the  aren't work. Now, first, there's two things that actually are derived from this verse.

First of  all, look, the first thing we're told is that God's love is the cause of his anger. Because notice, he doesn't say, yet, O Lord, you are our Father and you are our artist,  so you shouldn't be angry. That's not what he says. He said, you shouldn't be angry forever. You shouldn't be angry beyond measure.

Beyond measure, actually, it literally means unto  muchness, which is the same as ultimately forever. Go back. The first thing that teaches us is  because he's a Father and because he's an artist, his anger is justified. Very important to see,  he doesn't say, because you're our Father, you shouldn't be angry. Oh, no, not at all.

Fathers and artists get angry. Oh, my, do they get angry? It's so interesting that this verse,  in light of this famous quote by C.S. Lewis, in the problem of pain, chapter 3, Lewis says this,  you ask for a loving God? Well, you have one.

The great Lord of terrible aspect loves you. Not a senile benevolence that drowsily wishes you to be happy in your own way. Not the cold philanthropy of a conscientious magistrate, nor the care of a host who feels somehow  responsible for the comfort of his guests, but the consuming fire himself. The love that made  the world's persistent as the artist's love for her work, a Father's love for a child,  inexorable and exacting as a man's love for his wife. Now, what is he saying?

I'll say what he's  saying. The opposite of love is not anger. Oh, no, the opposite of love is hate, and the ultimate  hate is indifference. But see, when you're passionately hating somebody, you're really giving them  quite a lot of attention. I mean, you're treating them as important.

I mean, if that's not so bad,  the passionately, the ultimate hate is to be not care. And therefore, if God looks down at this  world and sees how we're treating each other and sees how we're living and sees how we're treating him,  if God looks out this world and is not furious, he is not a Father and he is not an artist,  and we are not his artwork and we are not his kids. If God is a, because, as Louis says, some other  place, anger is what love bleeds when you cut it. If someone really loves you and you're screwing  up and you're doing something wrong, then you're blowing it and you're doing a lot of bad things,  that person is furious at you. And if they're not furious at you, it doesn't matter what they say,  that's just sentimentality, they don't love you.

And therefore, what we see, first of all,  it's very important, is God's love is furious love and is furious loving fury. They come together,  you've got to believe in both. That's what we're trying to do. We're trying to show you that they're  really two sides the same coin. So God's love is the cause of his anger.

But the second thing we're  told here, and this is the tension almost, God's love also is not just the cause of his anger. God's love is also the satisfaction of his anger. It's not just here we're being taught that  this is love that causes his anger. It's also being hinted at, but it's very strong. Yet because  your father, you should be angry, but do something about your anger.

Don't be angry forever. Don't be  angry unto muchness. Don't be angry ultimately. Do something. There's a fascinating place where Louis,  C.S.

Lewis is writing a guy named Malcolm, and Malcolm says, oh, I don't like this idea of an  angry God. I just can't buy this idea of an angry God. And Louis says something fascinating. He says,  my dear Malcolm, think of the fullest reconciliation between people. Is peace restored through a moral  lecture?

Or is peace restored if the offense is not said to matter? Now that's pretty interesting  because on the one hand, there's moralism and there's relativism. There's two ways to deal. Let's just say somebody's done something wrong. You're un-reconciled with somebody.

You're un-reconciled. What do you do? A moral lecture? Or else, oh, I guess who's to say whether what you did was wrong? A moralism relative?

No, listen, what he says. What should you do? If not moralism and not relativism,  anger. He says, think of the fullest reconciliation between people. Is peace restored through moral  lecture?

Or the offense is not to matter? You know better. Anger, not pivish, fits of temper,  but just generous, scalding indignation. It is anger that passes, not necessarily all at once,  but anger that passes into embracing, exultant, rewelcoming love. That's how friends and lovers  are truly reconciled.

Hot wrath and then hot love. Such anger is the fluid that love bleeds when  you cut it. I know what he's talking about. So it's probably you, but you know how rare that is. Because usually, usually when somebody sins against you, you're not angry because you don't love them.

Other times, you are angry because you do love them. But when you get that anger expressed,  you blow up at them. You don't know how to do a surgical strike with your anger. What Lewis is saying  is he says, a moral lecture where you hold the anger in or you try to blow it off or you shrug it off  or you pass it over. That doesn't work.

Here's what works. When you come in, you express your anger and  you say, I love you. That's why I'm angry. And I hate what you're doing to yourself and I hate what  you're doing to my relationship with you. And I won't put up with it anymore.

And I'm mad. And when you do a surgical strike, when you actually put the anger on the sin, when you put the anger  on the evil, when you pour out your wrath on the sin itself, it's keeping you from the other person. Very often, that kind of anger is what really wakes the person up. That kind of anger is what really  embraces makes you eventually fall in each other's arms. Oh yeah.

Hot. Hot anger. Hot love. God did do it. We know he did it because remember our sins no more.

Do something. Your love is the  cause of your anger, but let your love be the satisfaction of your anger. And of course verse 17 says,  yeah, of course, he says, I will recreate you. I will change you. I will remember your sins no more.

How did he do it? Well, it's pretty simple, but it's critical on the cross. We read about it last  week on the cross. Is God going to be a God of justice, but not a God of fury, but not love? Is he  going to punish us, but then he loses us, or is he going to love us and then not be just?

Only if  the cross happened, only if the cross happened. Can he be a God of furious love and loving fury? All at once. Because all he hears what the Bible teaches. Jesus Christ is the judge who was judged.

Jesus Christ took all of the anger for all the wrath, for all of the injustice. And it went into  his heart, so that when you believe in him, there's nothing left for you. Now, he don't ask you this  question. Now, let's go back. This is the point.

Do you believe in a God of wrath? Ah, somebody says,  no, I don't. I don't, I believe God is a God of love. I don't believe he punishes people. What did it  cost your God to love you?

Well, you say, I don't know, nothing. I guess. Well, then how do you  know how much you love? He loves you. This is the reason why you're not thrilled by the idea.

This  reason why you haven't had your life changed by the idea. It's just sentimentality. To the degree  you believe in justice and you believe in anger and you believe in hell to that degree, you know  how much you're worth to him because he paid it. If you don't believe in hell, if you don't believe  in punishment, if you don't believe in justice and if you don't believe in judgment, you have no  idea what God did for you. You have no idea what Jesus did for you.

You have no idea how valuable you  are. You don't walk around filling love to the sky. You don't, you don't. And it's your fault  because you don't have an angry God because you're just going along with what everybody said. Don't do it.

If you know what he did for you, if you know there's no judgment left for you,  then when you're walking on the street like this happens to everybody and something comes along and  hits you and you say, you call yourself a good person. That voice, the part you wretch,  retreat and shame. And Jesus says, come hear my love, I bore the blame. You must sit down and taste  my meat. So I did sit and eat at George Herbert.

But look, here's what, how do you know he loves you? How do you know how much he loves you? How do you walk around filling love? Angry God who paid  the penalty himself. Now look, let's just, let's conclude with this just a couple of thoughts.

Remember I said in the beginning, unless you have a God of both fury and love, loving fury and  furious love, there'll be distortions in your life. Just think about this with me for a second. Okay, let's apply this. Do you have a God of love only? Love without anger.

You know, love,  do you have a God who never says no to you? There's anything in the Bible you don't like you say,  why can't believe in that anymore? Therefore you don't have a God who can contradict you. You don't  have a God who can say no to you. You don't have a God who actually does anything, but always accept  you.

That means you don't have a God. You have it, but yourself. And here's what you're like. Try to raise a kid like that. Try to raise a kid where you never contradict them.

You never  cross their will. You never chaste in them. You never discipline them. You never say no to them. Raise a child like that.

Listen, abusive parents are pretty bad. Permissive parents are every bit  as bad. Kids that grow up like that feel like orphans and they are. And people who grow up with  an idea of a God who just loves them and accepts them in every way, they grow up feeling like orphan  spiritually and they are. You know, you say, you know, you have a God of love without fury.

You don't really have a God. But then on the other hand, do you have an angry God who's not a God  of love, a God of standards, a God of righteousness? It won't work. Your life won't work. You know,  it's interesting at the end of Luke 16, a very famous parable of Lazarus in the rich man.

There's a  place where Abraham's calls him in pardon me. The rich man is down in hell and he calls up to  Abraham and he says, Father Abraham, if I knew about hell, you know, I wouldn't have lived the way  I lived. So my brothers are still alive. Would you please send somebody back from the dead to go and  tell them about this place? So they'll judge them in their lives.

And what does Abraham say? It won't be enough. You said, what? Somebody coming back from the dead saying, stop, you know,  it's Marley's ghost. Oh, stop, please, obey the thinking amendments.

Or you'll be like me. That won't  be enough. It was enough for Scrooge. That's fiction. That's fiction.

I'm a pastor. I've seen an  awful lot of people make promises to an angry God. Promises when they felt like they were stock promises  when they felt like, oh, I better do something or God's going to get me. They never work because  fear cannot awaken love in you. Only love can awaken love in you.

And if you have nothing but an  angry guy, see if you have a loving God without fury, you've got nothing. But if you have a  furious God without love, you've got something and it'll crush you. You will be a driven person. You'll never be able to live up. You'll always be fling with no one pursuing.

You'll be like  two little butters stretched over too much bread. When Paul said, the love of Christ constrains me,  he was thinking of Jesus Christ another wrath of God, and that turned him into a man of courage. It melted his heart. It can do the same thing for you. If you have never surrendered your life to  this God, do you know what that means?

His anger is at work in your life. What? Yes, to drive  you into the arms of his love, because that's what his anger is always after. So, go along. Let's  pray.

Our Father, I pray if there's anybody here tonight who's certainly upset with the idea  of an angry God, I pray that they would think and not just react. Father, for many of us, we have  the intellectual belief that you're a God of justice and judgment, but we haven't thought out what  the implications of that are. We pray that you would give us more peace. You would give us more  civility, more humility and a greater sense of our love, our loveness. And we ask that you would  help us do that tonight by the power of your Holy Spirit.

We thank you, Lord, that you're a God  like this. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today, more and more, we believe in a loving and good God who's more accepting of  people. And that's the gist of it. I don't know. I was there. I mean, I had that in eighth  grade, ninth grade.

But here's what I'm going to say, the biblical and three God, the angry  God that's presented to us by the Bible. Yeah, we have lost, but yet we have lost connection  with it in our society and our culture. And I'm here to tell you, it's a bad thing. In fact,  I'll go this far. You need an angry God.

You need in your mind and in your heart a God  that gets angry at sin. You need an angry God to live with hope. You need an angry God  to live with humility and you need an angry God to know how loved you are. And if you don't  believe in an angry God, a really angry God who hates sin and is going to punish it,  you're impoverishing yourself. You're taking away all sorts of hope and humility and love.

That's what I'm here to tell you. And you know, you say, how does that work out? Well, okay,  let's go. First of all, and basically you just work right through the text on this. First of all,  verses one to three tell us that you need an angry God, the biblical angry God, to live in hope.

To be able to live in hope in a broken world. One of the things that's easy to miss when you  studies these books like Aziz, in fact, big parts of the Old Testament, is that they have a historical  situation. They were not just written as essays. They weren't lectures. They were written  into a historical situation.

And everybody agrees that Isaiah chapter 40 and following after chapter  40 was written to a nation to Israel that was facing exile, that was facing tremendous injustice,  that was going to face or did face or had faced when they read this. Their capital city drew  some torn down. Their own children slaughtered. Go read about it in Psalm 137. Their infants,  their little heads of their infant stashed against the rock by the victors.

Captivity,  chains, terrible injustice. And so what are they doing? Well, we see in verses one to three,  they're asking God to come down and judge the injustice. They're saying, oh, well,  you would run the heavens and come down. The mountains would tremble before you.

As when fire sets, twigs of blaze come down to make your name known to your enemies and cause  the nations to quake. And what they're really saying is, if you came down with all your justice and  you went after the oppressors and you went after the perpetrators of injustice, they would be like  dust before you. They would crumble. They would be like burning twigs that the wind drives away. And so they're saying, of course, this is what verses one to three sang.

How in the world could  you possibly live in a world filled with injustice with any hope at all, unless you believed in a  and angry God? God gets angry in injustice. And so here's the first point. First point is the  God's anger in the Bible is not like our anger usually is. It's not crankiness.

It's not ill  temper. It's not ego. It's not it's not explosion. It's not out of control. It's a settled, fixed,  implacable, irrevocable, incorruptible, opposition to injustice and evil.

So that,  no debt will go unpaid. Every account will be squared and nobody will get away with anything. And that's what the Bible means when it says there's an angry God. That's the kind of God  that we have. That's what the Bible presents.

Now right away, objection. I know. Right away,  people immediately put up their hands and say, wait a minute. One of the problems with that,  one of the reasons why many people, most people in New York City certainly believe that that's a  primitive idea is they say, you know what? This idea of a God of vengeance.

Oh my, it's primitive. We've got to get beyond that because we need to work for a peaceful world. This idea of a vengeful  God who bears the sword. Oh my work. That leads to intolerance and eventually the violence.

What you really need is you need to believe in an accepting God if you're going to believe in a God. You have to believe that sin is in the eye of the beholder. You have to believe that sin is sort of  a matter of perspective. This idea of a God of vengeance. That's going to lead to nothing but  violence.

Nothing but intolerance and violence. Well recently I read a book that is one of the most  powerful refutations of that extremely common belief that we have to get beyond a God of vengeance  if we're going to have a world of peace. Incredible book actually. In many ways, it's a book by  written by Miroslav Wolf, whose Croatian and the name of the book is exclusion and embrace. And let me read you his thesis.

He says in this book, because his Croatian, he was raised in  the former Yugoslavia, he has seen all the stuff the people who this passage was written to,  who are crying out for vengeance and crying out because of the injustice. He's seen all that. He's been through that. And this is what he says. The practice of nonviolence requires a belief  in divine vengeance.

I'll say that again because it just, I mean, if nobody's eyebrows are raised,  you're not listening. The practice of, there we go, that's better. The practice of nonviolence  requires a belief in divine vengeance. He says, the only way to nonviolence is to believe in a God  who gets angry at injustice. Without an angry God, you'll never get out.

You'll never get into  nonviolence. You'll be stuck in the cycle of violence. Now, how does he make that point? Well,  here it is. Here's the quote.

And he says, my thesis that the practice of nonviolence requires a  belief in divine vengeance will be unpopular with many Christians, especially in the West. But to the person inclined to dismiss it, please imagine something. Imagine you're delivering  a lecture in a war zone where I delivered this chapter as a paper. And among your listeners are  people whose cities and villages have first been plundered, then burned, and then leveled to the ground,  whose daughters and sisters have been raped, and whose fathers and brothers have had their  throat slit. Now, the topic of your lecture is a Christian attitude toward violence,  and the thesis is we should not retaliate and be sucked into the cycle of continued violence.

We should not pay back. Why not? And here's what he says, violence thrives today, secretly nourished  by the belief that God refuses to take the sword. And then he says, if you do this, if you lecture  like this, soon you will discover that it takes the quiet of a suburb for the birth of the thesis. The human nonviolence is the result of a God who refuses to judge.

And a scorch man soaked in  the blood of innocent, of the innocent, the idea will invariably die like other pleasant  captivity of a liberal mind. In a world of violence, it would not be worthy of God not to wield the  sword. If God were not angry at injustice and deception, did not take a final end of violence,  that guy would not be worthy of our worship. Now, can I put it in a nutshell? Here's what he's saying.

Anybody who says that a God of vengeance will lead to violence has not actually been a victim  of violence themselves. You live in a nice suburban little bubble, or a very, very nice area where  you haven't yourself been the victim of injustice. He says, when you're the victim of injustice,  you will have to pay back unless you're assured that there is a God of vengeance, that there is a  God who hates injustice, that there's a God who's angry with injustice. And a God who's going to settle  every account so that nobody gets away with anything, unless you believe in a God of divine vengeance,  you will not be able to resist picking up the sword and being, you know, being the avenger yourself,  or else you'll just die at a spare. That's the reason why he's able to come back and say it's  the practice of non-violence that absolutely requires a belief in divine vengeance.

And so here's  our first point. You know, people say, why do I need an angry God? He says non-violence is impossible  without belief in a judge. In fact, let me, let me, let me go, let me press a little further. If  you are, what he calls the victim of one of these liberal piety's, you've always heard of,  I believe in a God of justice, that would not lead to peace in the world.

That would lead to more  violence. He says, you will be absolutely, if anybody ever comes and actually does something bad to  you, you will be sucked right into pay back. Actually, you've been already. He just haven't had,  maybe in many cases, you haven't had actually, somebody actually attack you and draw blood or kill  you or kill, or kill people in that your family. And anybody tried to do that.

He says, because  unless you believe in a God of vengeance, you will not be a peacemaker. You will not be able to  live a life of peace in the world. You will not be able to live a life of hope in the world. In fact, one thing that worries about me, if I look out at it, many of you, many of you do live in  that bubble because most of us live in a world far more safe and far more happy and far more secure  than most other people who have lived anywhere else in the world or anywhere in any other time in  history. And if that bubble should break and you have a nambi-pambi God who does not wreak  vengeance on injustice, you will either get sucked into the violence you will have to pay back yourself  or else.

You'll die in despair. That's the first thing. You need a God. You need an angry God  where you won't be able to live in peace in an unjust world. Secondly, you need an angry God  if you're going to live in humility.

Now, here's what's so intriguing. Let's move right on to the  next three verses. All the commentators say it is extremely interesting to see the ironic  relationship between the first and second stanza, the first stanza is verses one to three. We just  read it. What they're saying is, we are the victims of injustice.

And so we call down into the world  the God of judgment. If you would only come down and make the mountains shake, what would happen? Well, the enemies, the wicked people, the enemies, the bad nations, what they would do is they  would just, they would be consumed. They would become dust. They'd become consumed.

And they would,  the wind would blow them away. But get this. See, before you, verse two, the nations would quake  before you. But now look, verses four, five, and six, here's the great irony. Who's tripling up now?

Who is wasting away? See, who is tripling up like a leaf, verse six? And like the wind, our sins sweep us away. They are. The very thing they call God down  to do is happening to them.

And this is what we were saying. And this is, at this point, by the way,  this is an extremely important little test to know whether or not you're understanding the difference  between the angry God that maybe you were taught about, or you taught other people, maybe  somebody taught you about this as you were growing up, or maybe you were taught other people  believed in an angry God. And the angry God of the Bible, when you meet the angry God of the  Bible, you will find out and you will come to see what they see. You'll get out of verses one to  three. When you're in one to three, what you're thinking is if God would come down, the bad people  would be judged.

But in verses four to six, they find out that we deserve as much judgment as  anybody else, that we too are under judgment, that we too absolutely deserve punishment as much  as those people that we thought were the wicked perpetrators. That's absolutely critical,  and this is one of the great tests to know whether or not you're getting in touch with the  biblical God. Let me show you what I mean. There's two kinds of people in the world that seem to  be opposites. There's two kinds of people in the world, those who divide everybody in the world,  in the two kinds of people, and those who don't.

Did you know that? Well, I meant there's two  groups of people that are very prominent. I wouldn't say there's only two kinds of people here. On the one hand, you've got people we would call religious people, traditionally religious. And they certainly believe that there are absolute standards, and that there are absolute moral values,  and that we're going to be judged by them.

And therefore they believe that if God were to come down,  He would judge the bad people. And people who are religious, they say, well, I don't cheat on my  spouse, and I go to my family, and I obey the Ten Commandments, and I go to church, or synagogue,  and I give to the poor, and so on. I'm a good person. And so you're in versus one to three. You say,  if God were to come down, you see, the bad people would be judged, and they feel pretty good about  themselves.

On the other hand, you've got their nemesis. I mean, in our society, the nemesis,  so that people believe in traditional moral values, are, you might call this secular people,  progressive liberal people, and what they say is, you know what? Everybody,  sin is in the eye of the beholder. Everybody's got their own way of defining sin. What sinful for  you wouldn't be sinful for me, and what we have to do is we have to embrace them.

We have to embrace  everybody. We have to tolerate everybody. We have to accept everybody. And they look very, very  tolerant, except they're just as much in versus one and three. Because what they are saying is,  yes, you know, what the trouble with this world is, is all those people over there who are in tolerant.

I'm not like them. You see, they're religious people, and they're religious people,  are all walking around saying, if only everybody in the world was like me, we wouldn't be in trouble. If only those people over there that are causing the trouble, if somebody would just knock them down. And so you see, it really doesn't matter whether you're religious or religious, whether you're  conservative or liberal, if you live in versus one, two, and three. But what happens to Christians?

When they finally get close and to see what God really is like, inevitably, what they say is,  verse six, all of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are filthy  rags. Now that is a stunning statement. In fact, you know, when you first read through it, you say,  wait, what? He didn't say all our sins are his filthy rags. Of course, they're filthy rags.

All our righteous, and he's not just saying righteousness is just a sort of a general thing,  our righteous deeds are filthy rags. What happens is a Christian has begun to look past the  externals into his or her own heart. Start looking at motivations. That's the only way you can possibly  say that my righteous deed stinks. I mean, how could a righteous deed stink?

How could doing the  right thing stink? How could be a stench in God's nostrils? Well, the answer is the gospel  turns you into a kind of Nietzschean person when you look at your own heart. You begin Nietzsche,  of course, was always looking at motives. Nietzsche is almost invented what's called the Hermann  Unix's suspicion.

Looking inside and saying, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're real good. You  go to church, you do this, you do that. But why? Why do you, you say to everybody, we should love  everybody, but why do you say everybody? What aren't you really trying to do is you're trying to keep  people down?

Are you trying to be superior? You say, oh, we should obey and should be very moral,  but why aren't you really trying to stay in power? You see, a Christian looks at my your own heart,  and here's what the Christian is saying. Christian is somebody who says, I become, I come to realize that  the reason for my sins and the reason for my good deeds is the same and it's wrong. I don't, even when I do a bad deed, I'm trying to be my own Lord, but when I do a good deed,  I am too.

When I do a bad deed, I'm trying to be my own Savior, but when I do a good deed,  I'm trying to be my own Savior. When I do good deeds, I'm really trying to get God to do right  by me, and I'm trying to control him. I'm trying to put him in my debt. I'm trying to, you see, one of the ways you can tell your righteousness is a filthy rag. A lot of you  are very righteous.

I'm going to thank you to do many good things, but you're always angry because  God's not letting your life go right. Why is that? You know why? He said, I've lived this very good  life and my sister-in-law is not living a very good life for my brother, and I know why is my  life going so bad? Whoa, whoa, wait a minute, Nietzsche says, wait a minute.

Why were you being good? Trying to get God to do your will. That's the essence of sin. Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache. We feel it in the world  around us and in our own lives.

How did it get this way? And what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing this month, What Is Wrong with the World? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer, drawing from a series of teachings given  at Redeemer. Dr.

Keller shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us,  and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes or choices,  or looking for hope and joy, What Is Wrong with the World will help you see how the gospel  speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us. This newly released book,  What Is Wrong with the World is our thanks for your gift this month to help gospel in life share  the good news of Jesus. Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com-slashgive. That's gospelandlife.com-slash-give.

It's very essence of sin. Everybody does my will. See, you know, you're a life for mine,  not my life for yours. Our wills cross, I get my way, you know? Your righteousness is a filthy  rag.

Now here's what goes on, unless you believe in a God of judgment and justice and you come into  the presence of that God, you're never going to be humbled. I'll tell you, and it's Christians who  understand this who are the most civil people. What do I mean by that? Unless you believe in an  angry God, you won't be civil. How are you going to live in a place like New York City with all these  people that are so different?

Different beliefs, different races, different cultures, different  philosophies, different religions. How are you going to be? Now, people with traditional religious  values have a tremendous, a trouble living in a city. Because they say, I've got the truth. I got the truth.

And therefore, I feel so superior to so many of these other people. You're not  going to be good citizens. You're not going to serve them. You're not going to sit down and treat them  as equals. You're just not.

But if you say, oh, I passed that, you see, I believe everything is  relative. But what are you going to do? You're going to be so upset with people who believe in absolute  values. You're going to, right, you're going to say, I'm so much better than they are. I hate those  kinds of people.

But wait a minute. Do you know how many people believe in absolute values in  New York City? Look at all the Muslims. Look at all the Orthodox Jews. See, look at all the,  you know, look at all the people of your Protestant who are Catholic, or your Catholic who are Protestant  and so forth.

I want you to know that unless you believe that you deserve judgment, you're going  to be a lousy neighbor. You're not going to look out next door and say, hey, I deserve as much  judgment as any perpetrator in this world. And therefore, I don't look at myself as superior to you. Unless you have that, you can be a lousy neighbor. You're not going to live civilly.

You're also not  going to be able to forgive because you're going to put yourself in judgment. One of the reasons why  you have to believe in an angry God who's going to square all accounts is because there's a  tremendous burden that some of you are carrying right now. When you look at what other people have  done to you, in fact, when you look and see what life is done to you, or even what God has done  for you to you, and you get upset because you don't understand why did that happen to me? What  you've done is you don't have an angry God. You're putting yourself in the shoes of a judge.

You don't believe in a God who really is going to judge. And that's the reason why you can't  forgive. If you're having trouble forgiving somebody right now, it's because you're stuck in  verses one, two or three, one, two, three. You haven't gotten a verses four to six yet. If you're having trouble, in fact, if you're having trouble even understanding why God  let this or that happen.

If you're just so upset because God didn't let this happen, God didn't let  that happen. This week, I was reminded of something that happened me a long time ago. I had a big  impact on my life. Why am I here tonight? Why is this church here?

Because my Presbyterian  denomination sent me to New York. Well, why was I Presbyterian? Well, because I fell in the  influence of a particular teacher my last semester and seminary. My last semester in graduate school. And he just got there barely because, you know, at the very end, but because I fell under his  influence, I became a Presbyterian therefore I was sent here and therefore we're here.

Hi, so why did that person come to that school? Well, you know, he almost didn't make it,  but he was, because he was British and he was having visa problems. But somebody in the state  department knew somebody at the seminary and a person in the seminary pulled some strings and he  got there just in time. So that person hadn't pulled those strings. He wouldn't have gotten there.

I wouldn't have come to his influence. I wouldn't have been Presbyterian. I wouldn't be here. Well, somebody says that's interesting. Why did somebody at the seminary have power the state  department?

Well, there was a student at the seminary then named Mike Ford whose father was Gerald  Ford who was the president of the United States at the time. Well, why was his father? That's why he had  cool. Well, why was his father president of the United States? Well, because Nixon resigned.

Well, why did Nixon resign? Because of the Watergate scandal. Well, why was there a Watergate  scandal? Because two burglars at the Watergate building kind of botched the job because one of them  forgot to close the door and latch it. And a night watchman noticed that the door was open, came in,  discovered that there was a burglary and et cetera, et cetera.

Now, here's the point. What if that door  hadn't been left open? We wouldn't be here. You wouldn't be here. Do you dare think you ever know  enough about what's going on in your life to be mad at God for it?

Do you know why this and that  happens? How could you ever be in a position to be the judge? Why are you worried because you don't  have an angry God who's working everything out justly? Why are you worried? Why can't you forgive?

Why can't you live in this city, civilly looking at everybody else as an equal because you don't have  an angry God? So first of all, you need an angry God if you're going to live in hope. Secondly,  you've got to have an angry God if you're going to live in humility, civility, thirdly. And lastly,  you need an angry God if you're really going to understand how loved you are. Now, I know this sounds the most contradictory.

What? The angrier you understand God to be against  sin and evil, the greater His wrath, the greater His justice, the greater His judgment, the more you  believe in hell, to the degree that you grasp those truths, to that degree you'll know how much  He loves you. Let's move right on down through the text. First of all, look, verses 8 and 9,  something very interesting happens here, especially the Stegelic here, verse 8. Yet, O Father,  you are our Father, we are the clay, you are the potter, we are all the work of your hand.

Do not  be angry beyond measure, O Lord, do not remember our sins forever. Now, you know, this is very interesting. First of all, God is characterized here as a Father and as an artist, a Father and an artist. See, because first of all, he says, you are our Father, that means us your children,  us his children, and you are the potter, which means he's the artist and we are the clay, we're the  aren't work. Now, first, there's two things that actually are derived from this verse.

First of  all, look, the first thing we're told is that God's love is the cause of his anger. Because notice, he doesn't say, yet, O Lord, you are our Father and you are our artist,  so you shouldn't be angry. That's not what he says. He said, you shouldn't be angry forever. You shouldn't be angry beyond measure.

Beyond measure, actually, it literally means unto  muchness, which is the same as ultimately forever. Go back. The first thing that teaches us is  because he's a Father and because he's an artist, his anger is justified. Very important to see,  he doesn't say, because you're our Father, you shouldn't be angry. Oh, no, not at all.

Fathers and artists get angry. Oh, my, do they get angry? It's so interesting that this verse,  in light of this famous quote by C.S. Lewis, in the problem of pain, chapter 3, Lewis says this,  you ask for a loving God? Well, you have one.

The great Lord of terrible aspect loves you. Not a senile benevolence that drowsily wishes you to be happy in your own way. Not the cold philanthropy of a conscientious magistrate, nor the care of a host who feels somehow  responsible for the comfort of his guests, but the consuming fire himself. The love that made  the world's persistent as the artist's love for her work, a Father's love for a child,  inexorable and exacting as a man's love for his wife. Now, what is he saying?

I'll say what he's  saying. The opposite of love is not anger. Oh, no, the opposite of love is hate, and the ultimate  hate is indifference. But see, when you're passionately hating somebody, you're really giving them  quite a lot of attention. I mean, you're treating them as important.

I mean, if that's not so bad,  the passionately, the ultimate hate is to be not care. And therefore, if God looks down at this  world and sees how we're treating each other and sees how we're living and sees how we're treating him,  if God looks out this world and is not furious, he is not a Father and he is not an artist,  and we are not his artwork and we are not his kids. If God is a, because, as Louis says, some other  place, anger is what love bleeds when you cut it. If someone really loves you and you're screwing  up and you're doing something wrong, then you're blowing it and you're doing a lot of bad things,  that person is furious at you. And if they're not furious at you, it doesn't matter what they say,  that's just sentimentality, they don't love you.

And therefore, what we see, first of all,  it's very important, is God's love is furious love and is furious loving fury. They come together,  you've got to believe in both. That's what we're trying to do. We're trying to show you that they're  really two sides the same coin. So God's love is the cause of his anger.

But the second thing we're  told here, and this is the tension almost, God's love also is not just the cause of his anger. God's love is also the satisfaction of his anger. It's not just here we're being taught that  this is love that causes his anger. It's also being hinted at, but it's very strong. Yet because  your father, you should be angry, but do something about your anger.

Don't be angry forever. Don't be  angry unto muchness. Don't be angry ultimately. Do something. There's a fascinating place where Louis,  C.S.

Lewis is writing a guy named Malcolm, and Malcolm says, oh, I don't like this idea of an  angry God. I just can't buy this idea of an angry God. And Louis says something fascinating. He says,  my dear Malcolm, think of the fullest reconciliation between people. Is peace restored through a moral  lecture?

Or is peace restored if the offense is not said to matter? Now that's pretty interesting  because on the one hand, there's moralism and there's relativism. There's two ways to deal. Let's just say somebody's done something wrong. You're un-reconciled with somebody.

You're un-reconciled. What do you do? A moral lecture? Or else, oh, I guess who's to say whether what you did was wrong? A moralism relative?

No, listen, what he says. What should you do? If not moralism and not relativism,  anger. He says, think of the fullest reconciliation between people. Is peace restored through moral  lecture?

Or the offense is not to matter? You know better. Anger, not pivish, fits of temper,  but just generous, scalding indignation. It is anger that passes, not necessarily all at once,  but anger that passes into embracing, exultant, rewelcoming love. That's how friends and lovers  are truly reconciled.

Hot wrath and then hot love. Such anger is the fluid that love bleeds when  you cut it. I know what he's talking about. So it's probably you, but you know how rare that is. Because usually, usually when somebody sins against you, you're not angry because you don't love them.

Other times, you are angry because you do love them. But when you get that anger expressed,  you blow up at them. You don't know how to do a surgical strike with your anger. What Lewis is saying  is he says, a moral lecture where you hold the anger in or you try to blow it off or you shrug it off  or you pass it over. That doesn't work.

Here's what works. When you come in, you express your anger and  you say, I love you. That's why I'm angry. And I hate what you're doing to yourself and I hate what  you're doing to my relationship with you. And I won't put up with it anymore.

And I'm mad. And when you do a surgical strike, when you actually put the anger on the sin, when you put the anger  on the evil, when you pour out your wrath on the sin itself, it's keeping you from the other person. Very often, that kind of anger is what really wakes the person up. That kind of anger is what really  embraces makes you eventually fall in each other's arms. Oh yeah.

Hot. Hot anger. Hot love. God did do it. We know he did it because remember our sins no more.

Do something. Your love is the  cause of your anger, but let your love be the satisfaction of your anger. And of course verse 17 says,  yeah, of course, he says, I will recreate you. I will change you. I will remember your sins no more.

How did he do it? Well, it's pretty simple, but it's critical on the cross. We read about it last  week on the cross. Is God going to be a God of justice, but not a God of fury, but not love? Is he  going to punish us, but then he loses us, or is he going to love us and then not be just?

Only if  the cross happened, only if the cross happened. Can he be a God of furious love and loving fury? All at once. Because all he hears what the Bible teaches. Jesus Christ is the judge who was judged.

Jesus Christ took all of the anger for all the wrath, for all of the injustice. And it went into  his heart, so that when you believe in him, there's nothing left for you. Now, he don't ask you this  question. Now, let's go back. This is the point.

Do you believe in a God of wrath? Ah, somebody says,  no, I don't. I don't, I believe God is a God of love. I don't believe he punishes people. What did it  cost your God to love you?

Well, you say, I don't know, nothing. I guess. Well, then how do you  know how much you love? He loves you. This is the reason why you're not thrilled by the idea.

This  reason why you haven't had your life changed by the idea. It's just sentimentality. To the degree  you believe in justice and you believe in anger and you believe in hell to that degree, you know  how much you're worth to him because he paid it. If you don't believe in hell, if you don't believe  in punishment, if you don't believe in justice and if you don't believe in judgment, you have no  idea what God did for you. You have no idea what Jesus did for you.

You have no idea how valuable you  are. You don't walk around filling love to the sky. You don't, you don't. And it's your fault  because you don't have an angry God because you're just going along with what everybody said. Don't do it.

If you know what he did for you, if you know there's no judgment left for you,  then when you're walking on the street like this happens to everybody and something comes along and  hits you and you say, you call yourself a good person. That voice, the part you wretch,  retreat and shame. And Jesus says, come hear my love, I bore the blame. You must sit down and taste  my meat. So I did sit and eat at George Herbert.

But look, here's what, how do you know he loves you? How do you know how much he loves you? How do you walk around filling love? Angry God who paid  the penalty himself. Now look, let's just, let's conclude with this just a couple of thoughts.

Remember I said in the beginning, unless you have a God of both fury and love, loving fury and  furious love, there'll be distortions in your life. Just think about this with me for a second. Okay, let's apply this. Do you have a God of love only? Love without anger.

You know, love,  do you have a God who never says no to you? There's anything in the Bible you don't like you say,  why can't believe in that anymore? Therefore you don't have a God who can contradict you. You don't  have a God who can say no to you. You don't have a God who actually does anything, but always accept  you.

That means you don't have a God. You have it, but yourself. And here's what you're like. Try to raise a kid like that. Try to raise a kid where you never contradict them.

You never  cross their will. You never chaste in them. You never discipline them. You never say no to them. Raise a child like that.

Listen, abusive parents are pretty bad. Permissive parents are every bit  as bad. Kids that grow up like that feel like orphans and they are. And people who grow up with  an idea of a God who just loves them and accepts them in every way, they grow up feeling like orphan  spiritually and they are. You know, you say, you know, you have a God of love without fury.

You don't really have a God. But then on the other hand, do you have an angry God who's not a God  of love, a God of standards, a God of righteousness? It won't work. Your life won't work. You know,  it's interesting at the end of Luke 16, a very famous parable of Lazarus in the rich man.

There's a  place where Abraham's calls him in pardon me. The rich man is down in hell and he calls up to  Abraham and he says, Father Abraham, if I knew about hell, you know, I wouldn't have lived the way  I lived. So my brothers are still alive. Would you please send somebody back from the dead to go and  tell them about this place? So they'll judge them in their lives.

And what does Abraham say? It won't be enough. You said, what? Somebody coming back from the dead saying, stop, you know,  it's Marley's ghost. Oh, stop, please, obey the thinking amendments.

Or you'll be like me. That won't  be enough. It was enough for Scrooge. That's fiction. That's fiction.

I'm a pastor. I've seen an  awful lot of people make promises to an angry God. Promises when they felt like they were stock promises  when they felt like, oh, I better do something or God's going to get me. They never work because  fear cannot awaken love in you. Only love can awaken love in you.

And if you have nothing but an  angry guy, see if you have a loving God without fury, you've got nothing. But if you have a  furious God without love, you've got something and it'll crush you. You will be a driven person. You'll never be able to live up. You'll always be fling with no one pursuing.

You'll be like  two little butters stretched over too much bread. When Paul said, the love of Christ constrains me,  he was thinking of Jesus Christ another wrath of God, and that turned him into a man of courage. It melted his heart. It can do the same thing for you. If you have never surrendered your life to  this God, do you know what that means?

His anger is at work in your life. What? Yes, to drive  you into the arms of his love, because that's what his anger is always after. So, go along. Let's  pray.

Our Father, I pray if there's anybody here tonight who's certainly upset with the idea  of an angry God, I pray that they would think and not just react. Father, for many of us, we have  the intellectual belief that you're a God of justice and judgment, but we haven't thought out what  the implications of that are. We pray that you would give us more peace. You would give us more  civility, more humility and a greater sense of our love, our loveness. And we ask that you would  help us do that tonight by the power of your Holy Spirit.

We thank you, Lord, that you're a God  like this. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.

### 引言：罪的问题

为什么世界如此破碎？为什么我们甚至能够对我们所爱的人造成如此大的伤害？人们指向政治、贫困或心理学，但这些都无法完全解释我们在自己和历史中所看到的。这个月的播客中，Tim Keller 正在从一个系列中讲解这个问题：我们出了什么问题？圣经关于罪的教导提供了唯一足够深刻的解释来面对真相的复杂性，并提供了唯一足够强大的希望来改变我们。

> 以赛亚书 64:1-9，然后跳到这段长经文的后半部分，以赛亚书 65:17-18。

所以读 1 到 9 节，以及 17 到 18 节。哦，愿你裂天而降，山岭在你面前震动，正如火焰点燃树枝并使水沸腾，降临使你的名被敌人知晓，使列国在你面前战栗。因为当你做我们意想不到的奇妙事情时，你降临，山岭在你面前震动，自古以来没有人听见，没有耳朵听见，没有眼睛看见，除了你之外，没有神为那些等候他的人行事。你来帮助那些乐意行义、记念你道的人，但当我们继续犯罪时，你就发怒。我们怎么能得救呢？我们都像不洁净的人，我们所有的义行都像污秽的衣服。我们都像叶子一样枯萎，像风一样我们的罪把我们吹走，没有人呼求你的名，或努力抓住你，因为你掩面不顾我们，使我们因罪孽消耗殆尽。然而，主啊，你是我们的父亲，我们是泥土，你是陶匠，我们都是你手中的工作。主啊，不要过度发怒，不要永远记住我们的罪，哦，求你看顾我们，因为我们都是你的子民。看哪，我要创造新天新地。先前的事不再被记念，也不再进入心中，但要因我所创造的永远欢喜快乐，因为神要创造耶路撒冷成为喜乐，它的子民成为欢乐，这是神的话。

### 第一部分：愤怒的神的必要性

现在，我们正在研究圣经关于罪的教导，我们特别深入研究了希伯来圣经，实际上特别是以赛亚书，今晚，我们来到圣经关于罪的教导中最不受欢迎的部分，我将告诉你们，我已经请了招待员锁上门，以便你们至少听到第一个要点，听完这个非常令人不快的讲道介绍。这个教导是说神是一个愤怒的神。神会生气，看，第5节，你对我们生气，第9节，不要对我们生气。圣经向我们展示了一个对罪愤怒的神。

**你需要一个愤怒的神来活在希望中。** 你需要一个愤怒的神来活在谦卑中，你需要一个愤怒的神来知道你有多被爱。如果你不相信一个愤怒的神，一个真正愤怒的神，恨罪并将惩罚它，你是在贫穷自己。你正在剥夺各种希望、谦卑和爱。这就是我要告诉你的。

#### 1. 活在希望中

首先，第一到三节告诉我们，你需要一个愤怒的神，圣经中的愤怒的神，来活在希望中。在一个破碎的世界中能够活在希望中。当你研究这些书籍时，比如以赛亚书，实际上是旧约的大部分内容，它们有一个历史背景。它们不仅仅是作为文章写的。它们不是讲座。它们是写在一个历史背景中的。所有人都同意，以赛亚书第40章及其后的内容是写给一个面临流亡的国家以色列的，他们面临着巨大的不公正，他们将要面对或已经面对或曾经面对过，当他们读到这段经文时。他们的首都耶路撒冷被摧毁。他们自己的孩子被屠杀。去读诗篇137篇。他们的婴儿，他们的小婴儿的头被胜利者砸在岩石上。被俘，锁链，极大的不公正。

> "哦，愿你裂天而降，山岭在你面前震动。"

### 第二部分：谦卑地生活

#### 1. 认识到我们自己的罪

现在，这里有什么令人着迷的。让我们直接进入接下来的三节。所有的评论家都说，看到第一和第二节之间的讽刺关系是极其有趣的，第一节是第一到三节。我们刚刚读过。他们在说，我们是不公正的受害者。因此，我们呼求世界中的审判之神。如果你能下来并使山岭震动，会发生什么？好吧，敌人，邪恶的人，敌人，坏的国家，他们会被消灭。他们会变成尘土。他们会被消灭。风会把他们吹走。但看看这个。看，第2节，列国会在你面前战栗。但现在看，第4、5、6节，这里是伟大的讽刺。现在是谁在枯萎？谁在消耗殆尽？看，第6节，谁像叶子一样枯萎？像风一样，我们的罪把我们吹走。他们是。正是他们呼求神来做的事情正在发生在他们身上。

**我们都像不洁净的人，我们所有的义行都像污秽的衣服。**

### 第三部分：理解神的爱

#### 1. 神的爱与愤怒

现在，我知道这听起来最矛盾。什么？你越理解神对罪和邪恶的愤怒，他的愤怒越大，他的公义越大，他的审判越大，你越相信地狱，越能理解这些真理，你就越能知道他有多爱你。

> "然而，父啊，你是我们的父亲，我们是泥土，你是陶匠，我们都是你手中的工作。"

首先，神在这里被描绘为父亲和艺术家，父亲和艺术家。因为首先，他说，你是我们的父亲，这意味着我们是他的孩子，我们是他的孩子，而你是陶匠，这意味着他是艺术家，我们是泥土，我们是他的作品。

**神的爱是他愤怒的原因。** 因为注意，他没有说，因为你是我们的父亲，你不应该生气。这不是他说的。他说，你不应该永远生气。你不应该过度生气。过度生气，实际上，它字面意思是过度的意思，与最终永远相同。

> "爱的对立面不是愤怒。哦，不，爱的对立面是恨，而最终的恨是冷漠。"

### 结论

如果你知道他为你做了什么，如果你知道没有审判留给你，那么当你像这样走在街上，这种情况发生在每个人身上，有些东西过来打击你，你说，你称自己为好人。那个声音，你这个可怜的家伙，退缩并感到羞耻。耶稣说，来听我的爱，我承担了责任。你必须坐下来品尝我的肉。所以我坐下来吃了乔治·赫伯特的东西。但看，这是什么，怎么知道他爱你？你怎么知道他有多爱你？你怎么走在街上感到被爱？愤怒的神亲自承担了惩罚。

让我们祷告。我们的父亲，我祈祷如果今晚这里有任何人对愤怒的神的想法感到不安，我祈祷他们会思考而不仅仅是反应。父亲，对于我们中的许多人，我们有智力上的信仰，你是一个公正和审判的神，但我们没有思考出这意味着什么。我们祈祷你会给我们更多的平安。你会给我们更多的文明，更多的谦卑和更大的爱，我们请求你今晚通过圣灵的力量帮助我们做到这一点。我们感谢你，主，你是这样的神。我们奉耶稣的名祷告。阿门。
