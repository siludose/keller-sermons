### Introduction: The Problem of Sin

Why is the world so broken? And why are we capable of inflicting such harm, even toward those we love? People point to politics, poverty, or psychology, but none of these fully explain what we see in ourselves and in history. This month on the podcast, Tim Keller is teaching from a series exploring the question, what's wrong with us? Knowing us how the Bible's teaching on sin offers the only explanation deep enough to face the truth in all its complexity, and the only hope powerfully enough to transform us.

The passage on which our teaching is based is print out in your bullet and it's Hebrews 12, and I'm only going to read from verses 7, pardon me, from 14 to 17. From chapter 12 verses 14 to 17.

> Therefore, strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees, make level paths for your feet, so that the Lamb may not be disabled but rather healed, make every effort to live in peace with all men and to be holy. Without holiness, no one will see the Lord. See to it that no one misses the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and to file many. See that no one is sexually immoral or godless like Esau, who for a single meal sold as inheritance rights as the oldest son. Afterwards, as you know, when he wanted inherit the blessing, he was rejected. He could bring about no change of mind, though he sought the blessing with tears.

This is God's word.

### The Story of Esau

And what we're doing is we're looking at all through the, through the lent, we've been looking at sin, what it is, and we've been looking at seven case studies, seven deadly sins. And the last one we look at here today has to do with anger.

Let me tell you two stories about anger. Two stories about anger and in how it works itself out in a family situation. The first story is a story referred to here by the Hebrews writer. When he refers to Esau is a great example of bitterness. And if you go back into Genesis 25, 26, 27, you see a story about twins, twin boys who were born to Isaac and Rebecca. And they were twins Esau and Jacob and Esau came out first, technically, therefore he was the oldest. And that was pretty significant. Because the oldest got the birthright, the oldest got the headship of the family. The oldest got the headship, meaning that that one would be the one who set the family's priorities and values, who led the family, who got the bulk of the wealth, who kept on the line, kept the line going.

But the Lord sent a prophecy to Rebecca and therefore to Isaac just before they were born. And in that prophecy, the Lord said, I want the elder to serve the younger. And this was God's way of saying, yeah, Esau came out first. But I want Jacob to be the head. I want Jacob to be the one who sets the course for the family. I want Jacob to be the one who carries on the family line out of Jacob while I bring the Messiah while I'd be blessing the earth.

Isaac and Rebecca both knew about what God's will was for their children. But Isaac turned his heart away because Isaac liked Esau best, Isaac favored Esau. And as a result, whenever you do this, whenever you say I can really run my life better than God says, he made quite a mess of this family by showing favoritism in the way he did. He takes Esau and Jacob and he puts a wedge between, Isaac puts a wedge between himself and his wife, Rebecca, a wedge between Esau and Jacob. And by indulging him and by doting on him and probably a lot of other things, Esau grows up to be a wild man. He grows up to be an impulsive man, unstable man, a hot tempered man, a man of anger, a man who's impulsive.

Great example of it is one day he comes in from being out hunting and Jacob is cooking some stew. And Isaac says, I've got Esau says I've got to have this stew where I'll die. And Jacob says, you know, the birthright thing that we've been talking about for years, sell it to me. I'll give you the stew. If you let me be the head of the family, and Esau says, sure, I, what good is it to be the head of the family if I'm going to starve to death? Then he eats the stew and he forgets about what doesn't forget. He just forget, he laughs at the promise, he ignores the promise.

And a day comes, finally, Isaac is very old, Isaac is now blind. And Isaac says today I'm going to bless Esau. I'm going to in a sense officially make him the head of the family. So he says, Esau, go out, hunt me something up, fix me the meal, come back in, I will make you the head, I'll officially bless you. As Esau leaves, Rebecca hears it, Rebecca sends Jacob in in disguise, Isaac ends up blessing Jacob and saying, your brother will serve you. And actually without knowing it, confirming the Lord's will, Esau comes in a little bit later and says, here I am, and Isaac begins to shake. And Isaac says, wait a minute, if you're Esau, Jacob was here and I made him the head. I gave him the blessing, I gave him the birthright.

Now, what's interesting, the Bible tells us at that point, if you remember, yeah, Genesis 27 verse 34, it says when Esau heard his father's words, he burst out with a loud and bitter cry. I knew something, and Isaac knew it too, and that is this blessing thing wasn't magical. It wasn't magical. It was fraudulent, obviously, Jacob had full Isaac, and it didn't mean that if Isaac wanted to, Isaac could turn around at that point and say, well, wait a minute, wait a minute, it was a fraudulent thing. I was blind, I didn't realize it. You're the head. He could have done that. I wouldn't do it, why? Because I think at that point, something came home to Isaac that didn't come home to Esau and his wrath. Isaac realized he'd been fighting God all his life. Isaac realized that God was going to have his will done. And Isaac says to Esau, no, I can't change it. Isaac realized that Esau had been an idol in his life. Isaac realized that Esau had been more important than God and Isaac got a hold of his anger and Esau couldn't. And we're told that Esau had a grudge against Jacob. Rebecca comes to Esau, and Jacob, and he says, Esau is going to kill you when your father dies. Esau is consoling himself with the thoughts of killing you. That's a perfect example of a grudge, great definition too. He's comforting himself. He feels better when he thinks about how he's going to decapitate you. He holds the grudge. Jacob has to leave, and there's no need to go any further, other than to know that when Isaac does actually, in a sense, pronounce a blessing on Esau, he predicts that Esau is going to live by the sword, that Esau is going to stay a man driven by anger all of his life.

### A Modern Example

Let me tell you about another family. A lady named Amy Federiki lives in the New York area, and she and her family was the subject of a major article in the New York Times back in January. She had a pretty hard life, because when she was 26, she got married, and a few weeks after she got married, she found her husband had pancreatic cancer, and a few, three months after that, he died, and only one, she's a widow at 26. One year later, she was commuting home from her Manhattan job to her home in Queens on Long Island, and she was in the car, and a man got up in the car, turned around and started shooting everybody, and she was one of the six people who were killed in the Long Island railroad massacre.

She was part of a very close family, and the article goes on to show how remarkable that family was in its response to the whole tragedy. One of the first things that the family did was they donated Amy's organs to three people and saved their lives. One of the experts in organ donation points out this family is so odd, because generally, when a family is able to give to donate organs at a moment of crisis, a tragedy, grief, accident, they can't bear usually to see the person who got the organ. They don't want a relationship with them, they don't even want to see them, yet this family reached out to those people, brought them into their lives, are now very good friends, and you know, this is typical of the New York Times.

The real story is this, where did these people get this self-control? This is what it says in the Times, get this. It says, instead of turning bitter, as many of the others involved in this tragedy did, the family is forgiven. Born again Christians, the family speaks gently of Mr. Ferguson. We have been much in prayer for that man, they say. Their attitude is totally amazing to others, and one of the organ recipients has said, I could never have been that forgiving.

Here's what's interesting. This family looked behind the death dealer to death, looked behind the evil doer to evil, and released and spent their anger on the death and on the evil instead of on the evil doer. And as a result, instead of their anger spending them and controlling them and keeping them imprisoned in their past, they spent their anger to do some tremendous good.

### Understanding Anger

Two different families. One in the Bible, one right here in New York. What's the secret? How can you make sure that your anger does not imprison you and control you? How can you make sure that you control it? The writer of the Hebrews gives us some principles, and I'm just going to briefly mention them.

First of all, it tells you what anger is, and then secondly, it tells you three ways to handle it. Let's just look at them. Can't spend the time that we like to, but let's at least lay them out.

First of all, what anger is, you know what it tells us about anger? Esau was sexually immoral and godless, it says, and he had a root of bitterness. Now the sexually immoral is probably a bad translation and probably would be better translated apostate, but the interesting word is he was godless, and that's not a very good translation either. The word that literally means secular, a person focused on the immediate.

Now, let me put it in a very stark way, I mean, we could lay it out in a kind of abstract principle. We could say, anger is always tied to that which is your focus, but let me put it in a much more stark way, it'll get your attention. **Anger is always an outgrowth of love.** Anger is that which rouses you and rallies all of your faculties to defend that which you ultimately love. You get angry to the degree you love something. Anger is that which defends the thing which is threatened which you love. Your hierarchy of loves is your hierarchy of anger. Things that you don't love at all don't get you angry when they're threatened. Things that you love a little get you a little angry when they're threatened. Things that you love a lot make you very angry when you're threatened. You are as angry as you are loving and you are angry when that which you love is threatened. That's what anger is.

And the reason that's very important to see, it's very embarrassing. When we see great injustice being done, we get this a little bit angry and when our plans for our day off are completely thwarted, we're furious. When God gets angry and he's angry at sin all the time, why? Because he loves the right, the good and he loves his creation which is what sin is destroying. When he saw gets angry, it's because he loves his belly, he loves power, he loves the now.

See, we put it to you that way suddenly it gets pretty embarrassing and it gets very telling and it shows two quick things, two quick little things. When we realize that anger is a function of defending what you love and to the degree you love something, you see the way you find out what you're really love is follow your anger, follow your anger down. What you most get angry at, what you most get furious at and what you little bit get furious at and what you don't get furious about it all, that'll tell you what you love a little what you love, not at all, what you love the most.

The reason I say it's very telling is it tells us two things. First of all, it shows us why anger in the Bible is not a sin in itself. Oh no, it's not. God gets angry, Jesus gets angry, they're perfect. In fact, in Psalm 4 and in Ephesians 4, we are told this, Christians are told, be angry, but sin not, be angry. Do you know that there is a place in the Bible, at least two places, Ephesians 4 and so where Christians are commanded to be angry, you know why? If you never get angry at anything, it means you love nothing. In fact, the Bible says there are many situations in which a failure to be angry is a sin because of the failure to love.

There's a lot of people around who say, oh I'm a Christian, I don't get angry. That is an Eastern or a pagan stoicism, it's not Christianity, you'll never see the Bible talk about anger like that. The Stoics, you know, Marcus Aurelius, even a lot of Eastern religions say, the important thing, if you want to have power and control, if you want to be a strong person, don't let anything get to you, never let them see you sweat, never let them see you. You know what that is? Yeah, that gives you power, it kills your humanity. The Bible says, if you never get angry, it means that you have made yourself indifferent to everything except what? Your self-control, suddenly the important thing is that I'm never affected and that's the only thing you love is your equilibrium and that's why you never get angry. That's a terribly wrong thing to say, the Christians never get angry. If you don't ever get angry, it shows that things you ought to love, you don't.

### Handling Anger

Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty and heartache. We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way and what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing this month, what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer. Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer, Dr. Keller shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes or choices or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world will help you see how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us. This newly released book What Is Wrong with the World is our thanks for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the good news of Jesus.

Be angry. It's a sin if you're never angry, but it also tells us how anger goes wrong. Here's how it goes wrong. When the things that are most important in your life also happen to be most important in reality, then when you get angry, because the right is being trampled on, because the image of God and people is being trampled on. When you see people being cruelly used and you know about their dignity as people in the image of God, when you see human dignity being trampled on, when you see injustice being done, justice being trampled on, when you see truth being trampled on, when you see the name of God being trampled on, those things are the most important things in the universe and when the most important things in the universe, also the most important things in your heart, when you get angry at them, you'll find that your anger does not control you. You control it. It's useful. It works. It helps. It pushes you toward doing things that you want to do. It helps you focus.

But if the things that you love ultimately are not ultimately important, you'll find that your anger is a way of getting you to serve those false, ultimate loves. Anger is always a way that the things you love most, chain you into their service. And let me, let me, this takes us back to the theme that we saw in the beginning. You know, we've been doing this theme on, on, on, on sin, all during, lent, all during actually the winter. And we laid this principle down before and we lay it down one more time. Don't you see how it works? We said, sin is something that leads us to make things more important than God. Sin is what leads your heart to say, if I was married, things would really be happy. If I had children or if I was successful or if these people accepted me or if I had money or if I had a professional acclaim, all of us have things that we elevate up ahead of God. And we say, if I have that, I'll be happy. And we've talked about that. But now you see, that's what makes anger, what it is. When any of those things are threatened, your anger rises up and you're chained to that thing. You can't stop. You're out of control. It's imprisoned you. When something gets between you and this thing that you say, I've got to have to be happy, that's when the anger comes up and that kind of anger will work evil. That kind of anger will imprison. That kind of anger will control you instead of you controlling it. That anger will use you instead of you using it. That anger will do you instead of you doing it. That anger will spend you instead of you spending it. Okay. So how do you handle anger? So that you spend it instead of it spending you. How do you handle anger? Well, there's three things that are laid down here in this passage of Hebrews. Three things you got to do. Three principles. All right.

The first one is fairly simple, but important. You need to be aware of the anger in your life. That may seem pretty obvious, but what the metaphor is here, it calls bitterness a root. Now why does it call it a root? It calls it a root because roots are invisible. This is what ordinarily happens to us. We don't want to believe we're angry people. You know, when somebody makes us extremely angry, we hate to admit how important that thing is to us. Anger is a way, you know, your slip is showing when anger comes up. You know, when you know that somebody's hurt your reputation and you get furious, you don't want people to know how important your reputation is to you. When something goes wrong at work and you get furious, you don't want people to know how important that project was to you don't want people to know. In fact, you don't want to believe it yourself. And so what we do is we just get rid of it. We just stuff it. We say, I'm not angry. There's a part of our heart that says, I want to get that person, but we say, no, no. I've forgiven them. It's a way for you to feel in control of your life. But what happens is the roots there. And you will find that that root will defile you, it says, it will grow up eventually. It'll distort your life unless you're willing to see that you really do have anger. People walk around all the time saying, I'm not an angry person. I'm not an angry person. I'm not angry person. Suddenly, the right opportunity, a root may be down there and the whole tree is in there. The whole tree, but it's little cold or there's not, there's not enough rain. But the right opportunity comes along the right conditions and suddenly up comes the tree. You say to yourself, I'm not angry. I'm not angry. I'm not angry. Suddenly, a trapdoor opens and as far as it comes out. I'm not angry. I'm not angry. Suddenly, you see it's distorting your life. Some of you are cynical people. Don't you know what that is? That's bitterness. You've been hurt by somebody, and you're going to pay the world back by not trusting anyone again. That's bitterness. Some people say to me, I'm never going to be a Christian because I've seen such hypocrites. In other words, your bitterness toward people who have wronged you and disillusioned you, that's now distorting. It's defiling you. I've had people say, I met a guy once who hated Japanese. He was in a prisoner of war camp years ago during World War II, and he hates the Japanese now. You know what? He's more in prison now than he was then. The only way that a person who is wronged you can really keep controlling you is if you stay mad at them. If you stay mad at somebody, that bitterness is defiling you. It's controlling you. It's controlling your behavior right now. They've won. Evil has won. You're defiled. What are you going to do about it? First of all, be aware of it. Be aware. I have people who say to me, well now I don't want that person harmed. You sure? Usually what people mean is, I've forgiven that means I'm not going to try to hurt them, but would you like to hear somebody else doing it? Would you love to hear that somebody else did it? Would you love to hear that they've been hurt? That they've been brought down? You say, well of course I would. That's a root.

The second principle is this. The first principle is you've got to be aware. You've got to be willing to admit that it's there. You've got to be willing to admit it. You've got to be willing to see it. Second principle is very important. Second principle is you've got to be willing, I guess, to instead of being godless, be godful. What does that mean? Ask yourself. Ask yourself. When you find yourself really getting angry, say, what am I defending? Under the Holy Spirit, your anger will probably not be able to hold up to that question if you're willing to go underneath. What am I defending? You know, I love to be productive. And if my days of preparation, appearing sermons and things like that are interrupted, I can get pretty angry. And I have to ask myself, what am I defending? Well, I say, I just want to be productive. But look at what's going on there. I have to say to myself, if you get your goals today, if you get everything done that you want to get done in some deep recess of the heart, you're going to say, I'm an able person. I deserve to be senior pastor of a church. And if I don't get it done, I'll say, I am nothing. I am inadequate. I am unable. And if somebody comes between me and my goal, I get furious. I have to say, what am I defending? God came to Baruch back in Jeremiah 45. And he says to Baruch, Baruch was pretty upset. He wanted his wonderful career as a scholar and a scribe. But because he got linked up with Jeremiah, who completely crossed the establishment and everybody was against Jeremiah. So everybody was against Baruch and Baruch's career was going down the toilet. And he was discouraged in angry. And God comes to Baruch and he says, seek a style, great things for thyself. Seek them not. He says, Baruch, if you make your career more important than me, you're always going to be angry. And that's the reason you're an angry person. Make me your success. And you'll be free. Make me your success. Don't you see? Seek a style, great things for thyself. Seek them not. When you get angry, ask yourself, what am I defending? What is it? How am I being secular? How am I focusing on the immediate? How are penultimate things become ultimate to me? I will not be controlled by these things. I will not seek these things. These things will imprison me with through anger. I will not. I will not. I will not.

Well, last of all. So the first principle is you have to be aware of the roots in your life. Secondly, you've got to be willing to be God full. That means you've got to not just say, I shouldn't be mad. I shouldn't be mad. I shouldn't be mad. Instead, you got to go underneath and say, why has productivity? Oh, Tim Keller, why has your productivity become so important to you? Oh, Baruch, why has your career become so important to you? You say it's not enough just to say, why am I so angry? I shouldn't be angry. Christians don't get angry. You've got to go underneath. How are you being godless? Anger that's out of control, anger that has got you under its control, anger that's distorting your life over the years is a form of godlessness or a form of you might say false godfulness, put the right god back very belongs.

Last of all, look, it says, let no one miss the grace of God. Let know what? Let no root of bitterness spring up. See the last principle? Grace and bitterness prevent each other. They are absolute antithesis to each other. They're like fire and water. When you bring fire and water together, either the fire is greater than the water and it vaporizes the water or the water is greater than the fire and it extinguishes the fire, but they cannot be together. Either your understanding of grace will put out your bitterness or the bitterness will keep you from understanding grace. They cannot coexist together. Do you know why? When Jesus Christ was up on the cross, after he had paid the price for our sins, he said to tell us, I mean, he says, it's translated, it is finished. It is finished, but it can also be translated, it is paid because it's an economic term, but what he's really saying is, I finished the payment. Do you know what he did? I don't understand much about hell, but I know this. I don't understand a lot about hell, but I know this. Hell is endless. What does that mean? It means that our debt to God, what we owe God is so great that we never finish its payment. Let's not think about anything else for a minute. That's not think of all your other questions you might have about hell, but just realize hell is eternal. What that is saying is your payment is never finished and yet when Jesus Christ died on the cross for us, he finished the payment. That must mean that whatever he experienced in the cross was far worse than what you and I could experience in hell forever.

The only way and the perfect way and the absolute way for you to deal with what people owe you, how do you forgive people? How do you say they owe me? I forgive. They owe me, but I let it go. They owe me, but I will not demand payment. You have to let what you owe God absolutely beggar, absolutely overwhelmed what they owe you in your mind. You've got to say, look what he paid. He did not demand for me what I owed. It is finished. Here's the weird thing. If you demand payment from people, if you stick pins in their heart, or if you just stick pins in them in your mind, in your heart, if you avoid them, or if you can try to control them saying, you owe me. If you give little digs to them, if you give little digs to other people, if you say, I've forgiven you, but it's really your way of rubbing their nose in it by your righteous mercy showing you how much of a better person you are. There's hundreds of ways of making them pay. Jesus did not make you pay. If you try to make other people pay, it will never be finished. They will get more and more poor, and you will get more and more poor. But if you see Jesus saying it's finished, it's paid, then you can turn to other people and say, it's finished. I will not make you pay. He did not make me pay. You have to see Jesus dying like that. And if you do, it'll be over. It'll be finished. You'll be able to say, as he forgave me, I forgive them. Can you do that? You know, the great irony of the whole thing is being a better person is to say to people, you owe me. My parents, they owe me. My children, they owe me. This institution owes me. These people owe me. They owe me. Here's what's so ironic. If you hold onto their accounts, if you, instead of tearing them up, if you hold onto those accounts, what's so ironic about it, the Bible says you will get poor and poor and poor. Look at Jesus Christ. When he paid your accounts, instead of demanding payment, does he look poor to you? He's rich. He came down, right? He emptied himself. He paid the price. Therefore, God has highly exalted him. The great irony. If you demand payment, you'll get poor and poor. If you make the payment, you'll finally get rich. You'll finally be free. You'll finally find the same freedom that that family found that even the New York Times couldn't help but notice. And other people will notice it in use as well. Seek us that great things for thyself. Seek them not. Let's pray.

When you do, you will also receive free articles, sermons, devotionals, and other great gospel-centered resources. Again, it's all at gospelunlife.com.

### Introduction: The Problem of Sin

Why is the world so broken? And why are we capable of inflicting such harm, even toward those we love? People point to politics, poverty, or psychology, but none of these fully explain what we see in ourselves and in history. This month on the podcast, Tim Keller is teaching from a series exploring the question, what's wrong with us? Knowing us how the Bible's teaching on sin offers the only explanation deep enough to face the truth in all its complexity, and the only hope powerfully enough to transform us.

The passage on which our teaching is based is print out in your bullet and it's Hebrews 12, and I'm only going to read from verses 7, pardon me, from 14 to 17. From chapter 12 verses 14 to 17.

> Therefore, strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees, make level paths for your feet, so that the Lamb may not be disabled but rather healed, make every effort to live in peace with all men and to be holy. Without holiness, no one will see the Lord. See to it that no one misses the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and to file many. See that no one is sexually immoral or godless like Esau, who for a single meal sold as inheritance rights as the oldest son. Afterwards, as you know, when he wanted inherit the blessing, he was rejected. He could bring about no change of mind, though he sought the blessing with tears.

This is God's word.

### The Story of Esau

And what we're doing is we're looking at all through the, through the lent, we've been looking at sin, what it is, and we've been looking at seven case studies, seven deadly sins. And the last one we look at here today has to do with anger.

Let me tell you two stories about anger. Two stories about anger and in how it works itself out in a family situation. The first story is a story referred to here by the Hebrews writer. When he refers to Esau is a great example of bitterness. And if you go back into Genesis 25, 26, 27, you see a story about twins, twin boys who were born to Isaac and Rebecca. And they were twins Esau and Jacob and Esau came out first, technically, therefore he was the oldest. And that was pretty significant. Because the oldest got the birthright, the oldest got the headship of the family. The oldest got the headship, meaning that that one would be the one who set the family's priorities and values, who led the family, who got the bulk of the wealth, who kept on the line, kept the line going.

But the Lord sent a prophecy to Rebecca and therefore to Isaac just before they were born. And in that prophecy, the Lord said, I want the elder to serve the younger. And this was God's way of saying, yeah, Esau came out first. But I want Jacob to be the head. I want Jacob to be the one who sets the course for the family. I want Jacob to be the one who carries on the family line out of Jacob while I bring the Messiah while I'd be blessing the earth.

Isaac and Rebecca both knew about what God's will was for their children. But Isaac turned his heart away because Isaac liked Esau best, Isaac favored Esau. And as a result, whenever you do this, whenever you say I can really run my life better than God says, he made quite a mess of this family by showing favoritism in the way he did. He takes Esau and Jacob and he puts a wedge between, Isaac puts a wedge between himself and his wife, Rebecca, a wedge between Esau and Jacob. And by indulging him and by doting on him and probably a lot of other things, Esau grows up to be a wild man. He grows up to be an impulsive man, unstable man, a hot tempered man, a man of anger, a man who's impulsive.

Great example of it is one day he comes in from being out hunting and Jacob is cooking some stew. And Isaac says, I've got Esau says I've got to have this stew where I'll die. And Jacob says, you know, the birthright thing that we've been talking about for years, sell it to me. I'll give you the stew. If you let me be the head of the family, and Esau says, sure, I, what good is it to be the head of the family if I'm going to starve to death? Then he eats the stew and he forgets about what doesn't forget. He just forget, he laughs at the promise, he ignores the promise.

And a day comes, finally, Isaac is very old, Isaac is now blind. And Isaac says today I'm going to bless Esau. I'm going to in a sense officially make him the head of the family. So he says, Esau, go out, hunt me something up, fix me the meal, come back in, I will make you the head, I'll officially bless you. As Esau leaves, Rebecca hears it, Rebecca sends Jacob in in disguise, Isaac ends up blessing Jacob and saying, your brother will serve you. And actually without knowing it, confirming the Lord's will, Esau comes in a little bit later and says, here I am, and Isaac begins to shake. And Isaac says, wait a minute, if you're Esau, Jacob was here and I made him the head. I gave him the blessing, I gave him the birthright.

Now, what's interesting, the Bible tells us at that point, if you remember, yeah, Genesis 27 verse 34, it says when Esau heard his father's words, he burst out with a loud and bitter cry. I knew something, and Isaac knew it too, and that is this blessing thing wasn't magical. It wasn't magical. It was fraudulent, obviously, Jacob had full Isaac, and it didn't mean that if Isaac wanted to, Isaac could turn around at that point and say, well, wait a minute, wait a minute, it was a fraudulent thing. I was blind, I didn't realize it. You're the head. He could have done that. I wouldn't do it, why? Because I think at that point, something came home to Isaac that didn't come home to Esau and his wrath. Isaac realized he'd been fighting God all his life. Isaac realized that God was going to have his will done. And Isaac says to Esau, no, I can't change it. Isaac realized that Esau had been an idol in his life. Isaac realized that Esau had been more important than God and Isaac got a hold of his anger and Esau couldn't. And we're told that Esau had a grudge against Jacob. Rebecca comes to Esau, and Jacob, and he says, Esau is going to kill you when your father dies. Esau is consoling himself with the thoughts of killing you. That's a perfect example of a grudge, great definition too. He's comforting himself. He feels better when he thinks about how he's going to decapitate you. He holds the grudge. Jacob has to leave, and there's no need to go any further, other than to know that when Isaac does actually, in a sense, pronounce a blessing on Esau, he predicts that Esau is going to live by the sword, that Esau is going to stay a man driven by anger all of his life.

### A Modern Example

Let me tell you about another family. A lady named Amy Federiki lives in the New York area, and she and her family was the subject of a major article in the New York Times back in January. She had a pretty hard life, because when she was 26, she got married, and a few weeks after she got married, she found her husband had pancreatic cancer, and a few, three months after that, he died, and only one, she's a widow at 26. One year later, she was commuting home from her Manhattan job to her home in Queens on Long Island, and she was in the car, and a man got up in the car, turned around and started shooting everybody, and she was one of the six people who were killed in the Long Island railroad massacre.

She was part of a very close family, and the article goes on to show how remarkable that family was in its response to the whole tragedy. One of the first things that the family did was they donated Amy's organs to three people and saved their lives. One of the experts in organ donation points out this family is so odd, because generally, when a family is able to give to donate organs at a moment of crisis, a tragedy, grief, accident, they can't bear usually to see the person who got the organ. They don't want a relationship with them, they don't even want to see them, yet this family reached out to those people, brought them into their lives, are now very good friends, and you know, this is typical of the New York Times.

The real story is this, where did these people get this self-control? This is what it says in the Times, get this. It says, instead of turning bitter, as many of the others involved in this tragedy did, the family is forgiven. Born again Christians, the family speaks gently of Mr. Ferguson. We have been much in prayer for that man, they say. Their attitude is totally amazing to others, and one of the organ recipients has said, I could never have been that forgiving.

Here's what's interesting. This family looked behind the death dealer to death, looked behind the evil doer to evil, and released and spent their anger on the death and on the evil instead of on the evil doer. And as a result, instead of their anger spending them and controlling them and keeping them imprisoned in their past, they spent their anger to do some tremendous good.

### Understanding Anger

Two different families. One in the Bible, one right here in New York. What's the secret? How can you make sure that your anger does not imprison you and control you? How can you make sure that you control it? The writer of the Hebrews gives us some principles, and I'm just going to briefly mention them.

First of all, it tells you what anger is, and then secondly, it tells you three ways to handle it. Let's just look at them. Can't spend the time that we like to, but let's at least lay them out.

First of all, what anger is, you know what it tells us about anger? Esau was sexually immoral and godless, it says, and he had a root of bitterness. Now the sexually immoral is probably a bad translation and probably would be better translated apostate, but the interesting word is he was godless, and that's not a very good translation either. The word that literally means secular, a person focused on the immediate.

Now, let me put it in a very stark way, I mean, we could lay it out in a kind of abstract principle. We could say, anger is always tied to that which is your focus, but let me put it in a much more stark way, it'll get your attention. **Anger is always an outgrowth of love.** Anger is that which rouses you and rallies all of your faculties to defend that which you ultimately love. You get angry to the degree you love something. Anger is that which defends the thing which is threatened which you love. Your hierarchy of loves is your hierarchy of anger. Things that you don't love at all don't get you angry when they're threatened. Things that you love a little get you a little angry when they're threatened. Things that you love a lot make you very angry when you're threatened. You are as angry as you are loving and you are angry when that which you love is threatened. That's what anger is.

And the reason that's very important to see, it's very embarrassing. When we see great injustice being done, we get this a little bit angry and when our plans for our day off are completely thwarted, we're furious. When God gets angry and he's angry at sin all the time, why? Because he loves the right, the good and he loves his creation which is what sin is destroying. When he saw gets angry, it's because he loves his belly, he loves power, he loves the now.

See, we put it to you that way suddenly it gets pretty embarrassing and it gets very telling and it shows two quick things, two quick little things. When we realize that anger is a function of defending what you love and to the degree you love something, you see the way you find out what you're really love is follow your anger, follow your anger down. What you most get angry at, what you most get furious at and what you little bit get furious at and what you don't get furious about it all, that'll tell you what you love a little what you love, not at all, what you love the most.

The reason I say it's very telling is it tells us two things. First of all, it shows us why anger in the Bible is not a sin in itself. Oh no, it's not. God gets angry, Jesus gets angry, they're perfect. In fact, in Psalm 4 and in Ephesians 4, we are told this, Christians are told, be angry, but sin not, be angry. Do you know that there is a place in the Bible, at least two places, Ephesians 4 and so where Christians are commanded to be angry, you know why? If you never get angry at anything, it means you love nothing. In fact, the Bible says there are many situations in which a failure to be angry is a sin because of the failure to love.

There's a lot of people around who say, oh I'm a Christian, I don't get angry. That is an Eastern or a pagan stoicism, it's not Christianity, you'll never see the Bible talk about anger like that. The Stoics, you know, Marcus Aurelius, even a lot of Eastern religions say, the important thing, if you want to have power and control, if you want to be a strong person, don't let anything get to you, never let them see you sweat, never let them see you. You know what that is? Yeah, that gives you power, it kills your humanity. The Bible says, if you never get angry, it means that you have made yourself indifferent to everything except what? Your self-control, suddenly the important thing is that I'm never affected and that's the only thing you love is your equilibrium and that's why you never get angry. That's a terribly wrong thing to say, the Christians never get angry. If you don't ever get angry, it shows that things you ought to love, you don't.

### Handling Anger

Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty and heartache. We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way and what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing this month, what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer. Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer, Dr. Keller shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes or choices or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world will help you see how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us. This newly released book What Is Wrong with the World is our thanks for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the good news of Jesus.

Be angry. It's a sin if you're never angry, but it also tells us how anger goes wrong. Here's how it goes wrong. When the things that are most important in your life also happen to be most important in reality, then when you get angry, because the right is being trampled on, because the image of God and people is being trampled on. When you see people being cruelly used and you know about their dignity as people in the image of God, when you see human dignity being trampled on, when you see injustice being done, justice being trampled on, when you see truth being trampled on, when you see the name of God being trampled on, those things are the most important things in the universe and when the most important things in the universe, also the most important things in your heart, when you get angry at them, you'll find that your anger does not control you. You control it. It's useful. It works. It helps. It pushes you toward doing things that you want to do. It helps you focus.

But if the things that you love ultimately are not ultimately important, you'll find that your anger is a way of getting you to serve those false, ultimate loves. Anger is always a way that the things you love most, chain you into their service. And let me, let me, this takes us back to the theme that we saw in the beginning. You know, we've been doing this theme on, on, on, on sin, all during, lent, all during actually the winter. And we laid this principle down before and we lay it down one more time. Don't you see how it works? We said, sin is something that leads us to make things more important than God. Sin is what leads your heart to say, if I was married, things would really be happy. If I had children or if I was successful or if these people accepted me or if I had money or if I had a professional acclaim, all of us have things that we elevate up ahead of God. And we say, if I have that, I'll be happy. And we've talked about that. But now you see, that's what makes anger, what it is. When any of those things are threatened, your anger rises up and you're chained to that thing. You can't stop. You're out of control. It's imprisoned you. When something gets between you and this thing that you say, I've got to have to be happy, that's when the anger comes up and that kind of anger will work evil. That kind of anger will imprison. That kind of anger will control you instead of you controlling it. That anger will use you instead of you using it. That anger will do you instead of you doing it. That anger will spend you instead of you spending it. Okay. So how do you handle anger? So that you spend it instead of it spending you. How do you handle anger? Well, there's three things that are laid down here in this passage of Hebrews. Three things you got to do. Three principles. All right.

The first one is fairly simple, but important. You need to be aware of the anger in your life. That may seem pretty obvious, but what the metaphor is here, it calls bitterness a root. Now why does it call it a root? It calls it a root because roots are invisible. This is what ordinarily happens to us. We don't want to believe we're angry people. You know, when somebody makes us extremely angry, we hate to admit how important that thing is to us. Anger is a way, you know, your slip is showing when anger comes up. You know, when you know that somebody's hurt your reputation and you get furious, you don't want people to know how important your reputation is to you. When something goes wrong at work and you get furious, you don't want people to know how important that project was to you don't want people to know. In fact, you don't want to believe it yourself. And so what we do is we just get rid of it. We just stuff it. We say, I'm not angry. There's a part of our heart that says, I want to get that person, but we say, no, no. I've forgiven them. It's a way for you to feel in control of your life. But what happens is the roots there. And you will find that that root will defile you, it says, it will grow up eventually. It'll distort your life unless you're willing to see that you really do have anger. People walk around all the time saying, I'm not an angry person. I'm not an angry person. I'm not angry person. Suddenly, the right opportunity, a root may be down there and the whole tree is in there. The whole tree, but it's little cold or there's not, there's not enough rain. But the right opportunity comes along the right conditions and suddenly up comes the tree. You say to yourself, I'm not angry. I'm not angry. I'm not angry. Suddenly, a trapdoor opens and as far as it comes out. I'm not angry. I'm not angry. Suddenly, you see it's distorting your life. Some of you are cynical people. Don't you know what that is? That's bitterness. You've been hurt by somebody, and you're going to pay the world back by not trusting anyone again. That's bitterness. Some people say to me, I'm never going to be a Christian because I've seen such hypocrites. In other words, your bitterness toward people who have wronged you and disillusioned you, that's now distorting. It's defiling you. I've had people say, I met a guy once who hated Japanese. He was in a prisoner of war camp years ago during World War II, and he hates the Japanese now. You know what? He's more in prison now than he was then. The only way that a person who is wronged you can really keep controlling you is if you stay mad at them. If you stay mad at somebody, that bitterness is defiling you. It's controlling you. It's controlling your behavior right now. They've won. Evil has won. You're defiled. What are you going to do about it? First of all, be aware of it. Be aware. I have people who say to me, well now I don't want that person harmed. You sure? Usually what people mean is, I've forgiven that means I'm not going to try to hurt them, but would you like to hear somebody else doing it? Would you love to hear that somebody else did it? Would you love to hear that they've been hurt? That they've been brought down? You say, well of course I would. That's a root.

The second principle is this. The first principle is you've got to be aware. You've got to be willing to admit that it's there. You've got to be willing to admit it. You've got to be willing to see it. Second principle is very important. Second principle is you've got to be willing, I guess, to instead of being godless, be godful. What does that mean? Ask yourself. Ask yourself. When you find yourself really getting angry, say, what am I defending? Under the Holy Spirit, your anger will probably not be able to hold up to that question if you're willing to go underneath. What am I defending? You know, I love to be productive. And if my days of preparation, appearing sermons and things like that are interrupted, I can get pretty angry. And I have to ask myself, what am I defending? Well, I say, I just want to be productive. But look at what's going on there. I have to say to myself, if you get your goals today, if you get everything done that you want to get done in some deep recess of the heart, you're going to say, I'm an able person. I deserve to be senior pastor of a church. And if I don't get it done, I'll say, I am nothing. I am inadequate. I am unable. And if somebody comes between me and my goal, I get furious. I have to say, what am I defending? God came to Baruch back in Jeremiah 45. And he says to Baruch, Baruch was pretty upset. He wanted his wonderful career as a scholar and a scribe. But because he got linked up with Jeremiah, who completely crossed the establishment and everybody was against Jeremiah. So everybody was against Baruch and Baruch's career was going down the toilet. And he was discouraged in angry. And God comes to Baruch and he says, seek a style, great things for thyself. Seek them not. He says, Baruch, if you make your career more important than me, you're always going to be angry. And that's the reason you're an angry person. Make me your success. And you'll be free. Make me your success. Don't you see? Seek a style, great things for thyself. Seek them not. When you get angry, ask yourself, what am I defending? What is it? How am I being secular? How am I focusing on the immediate? How are penultimate things become ultimate to me? I will not be controlled by these things. I will not seek these things. These things will imprison me with through anger. I will not. I will not. I will not.

Well, last of all. So the first principle is you have to be aware of the roots in your life. Secondly, you've got to be willing to be God full. That means you've got to not just say, I shouldn't be mad. I shouldn't be mad. I shouldn't be mad. Instead, you got to go underneath and say, why has productivity? Oh, Tim Keller, why has your productivity become so important to you? Oh, Baruch, why has your career become so important to you? You say it's not enough just to say, why am I so angry? I shouldn't be angry. Christians don't get angry. You've got to go underneath. How are you being godless? Anger that's out of control, anger that has got you under its control, anger that's distorting your life over the years is a form of godlessness or a form of you might say false godfulness, put the right god back very belongs.

Last of all, look, it says, let no one miss the grace of God. Let know what? Let no root of bitterness spring up. See the last principle? Grace and bitterness prevent each other. They are absolute antithesis to each other. They're like fire and water. When you bring fire and water together, either the fire is greater than the water and it vaporizes the water or the water is greater than the fire and it extinguishes the fire, but they cannot be together. Either your understanding of grace will put out your bitterness or the bitterness will keep you from understanding grace. They cannot coexist together. Do you know why? When Jesus Christ was up on the cross, after he had paid the price for our sins, he said to tell us, I mean, he says, it's translated, it is finished. It is finished, but it can also be translated, it is paid because it's an economic term, but what he's really saying is, I finished the payment. Do you know what he did? I don't understand much about hell, but I know this. I don't understand a lot about hell, but I know this. Hell is endless. What does that mean? It means that our debt to God, what we owe God is so great that we never finish its payment. Let's not think about anything else for a minute. That's not think of all your other questions you might have about hell, but just realize hell is eternal. What that is saying is your payment is never finished and yet when Jesus Christ died on the cross for us, he finished the payment. That must mean that whatever he experienced in the cross was far worse than what you and I could experience in hell forever.

The only way and the perfect way and the absolute way for you to deal with what people owe you, how do you forgive people? How do you say they owe me? I forgive. They owe me, but I let it go. They owe me, but I will not demand payment. You have to let what you owe God absolutely beggar, absolutely overwhelmed what they owe you in your mind. You've got to say, look what he paid. He did not demand for me what I owed. It is finished. Here's the weird thing. If you demand payment from people, if you stick pins in their heart, or if you just stick pins in them in your mind, in your heart, if you avoid them, or if you can try to control them saying, you owe me. If you give little digs to them, if you give little digs to other people, if you say, I've forgiven you, but it's really your way of rubbing their nose in it by your righteous mercy showing you how much of a better person you are. There's hundreds of ways of making them pay. Jesus did not make you pay. If you try to make other people pay, it will never be finished. They will get more and more poor, and you will get more and more poor. But if you see Jesus saying it's finished, it's paid, then you can turn to other people and say, it's finished. I will not make you pay. He did not make me pay. You have to see Jesus dying like that. And if you do, it'll be over. It'll be finished. You'll be able to say, as he forgave me, I forgive them. Can you do that? You know, the great irony of the whole thing is being a better person is to say to people, you owe me. My parents, they owe me. My children, they owe me. This institution owes me. These people owe me. They owe me. Here's what's so ironic. If you hold onto their accounts, if you, instead of tearing them up, if you hold onto those accounts, what's so ironic about it, the Bible says you will get poor and poor and poor. Look at Jesus Christ. When he paid your accounts, instead of demanding payment, does he look poor to you? He's rich. He came down, right? He emptied himself. He paid the price. Therefore, God has highly exalted him. The great irony. If you demand payment, you'll get poor and poor. If you make the payment, you'll finally get rich. You'll finally be free. You'll finally find the same freedom that that family found that even the New York Times couldn't help but notice. And other people will notice it in use as well. Seek us that great things for thyself. Seek them not. Let's pray.

When you do, you will also receive free articles, sermons, devotionals, and other great gospel-centered resources. Again, it's all at gospelunlife.com.

### 中文翻译

### 引言：罪的问题

为什么世界如此破碎？为什么我们能够对我们所爱的人造成如此大的伤害？人们指责政治、贫困或心理学，但这些都不能完全解释我们在自己和历史中看到的现象。本月的播客中，Tim Keller 从一个系列中讲解这个问题：我们哪里出了问题？了解圣经关于罪的教导如何提供唯一足够深刻的解释来面对所有复杂性的真相，以及唯一足够强大的希望来改变我们。

我们的教导基于的经文是希伯来书 12 章，我只会从第 7 节，抱歉，从第 14 节到第 17 节读。希伯来书 12 章 14 到 17 节。

> 所以，你们要挺起疲乏的手，坚固无力的膝， 也要为自己的脚把道路修直，使瘸子不至于歪脚，反得痊愈。你们要追求与众人和睦，并要追求圣洁，非圣洁没有人能见主。又要谨慎，免得有人失了神的恩，免得有毒根生出扰乱你们，因此叫众人沾染污秽。又要谨慎，免得有人淫乱，或如以扫是贪爱世俗的，他因一点食物把自己长子的名分卖了。后来想要承受父所祝的福，竟被弃绝，虽然号哭切求，却得不着门路。

这是神的话。

### 以扫的故事

我们正在做的是，我们在整个四旬期中一直在研究罪是什么，并且我们一直在研究七个案例研究，七宗致命的罪。今天我们要看的最后一个与愤怒有关。

让我告诉你两个关于愤怒的故事。两个关于愤怒的故事，以及它如何在家庭环境中表现出来。第一个故事是希伯来书的作者提到的故事。当他提到以扫是苦毒的一个伟大例子时。如果你回到创世记 25、26、27 章，你会看到一个关于双胞胎的故事，双胞胎男孩是以撒和利百加的孩子。他们是双胞胎以扫和雅各，以扫先出来，因此他是长子。这非常重要。因为长子得到了长子的名分，长子得到了家族的领导权。长子得到了领导权，这意味着那个人将是设定家庭优先事项和价值观的人，领导家庭，获得大部分财富，保持家族延续的人。

但主在他们出生前给利百加和因此给以撒发了一个预言。在那个预言中，主说，我要让长子服侍幼子。这是神的方式说，是的，以扫先出来。但我想让雅各成为头。我想让雅各成为设定家庭方向的人。我想让雅各成为继续家族血脉的人，从雅各那里我将带来弥赛亚，我将祝福大地。

以撒和利百加都知道神对他们孩子的旨意。但以撒转移了他的心，因为以撒最喜欢以扫，以撒偏爱以扫。结果，每当你这样做，每当你说我可以比神说的更好地管理我的生活时，他通过偏袒的方式把这个家庭弄得一团糟。他把以扫和雅各分开，以撒在他自己和他的妻子利百加之间放了一个楔子，在以扫和雅各之间放了一个楔子。通过溺爱他和宠爱他以及可能的许多其他事情，以扫长大成为一个野蛮的人。他长大成为一个冲动的人，不稳定的人，一个暴躁的人，一个愤怒的人，一个冲动的人。

一个很好的例子是有一天他从外面打猎回来，雅各正在煮一些炖菜。以撒说，我有以扫说我必须吃这个炖菜，否则我会死。雅各说，你知道我们谈了多年的长子名分的事情，把它卖给我。我会给你炖菜。如果你让我成为家族的头，以扫说，当然，我，如果我饿死了，成为家族的头有什么好处？然后他吃了炖菜，他忘记了什么，不是忘记，他只是忘记，他嘲笑承诺，他忽视了承诺。

终于有一天，以撒非常老了，以撒现在失明了。以撒说，今天我要祝福以扫。我将以某种意义上正式让他成为家族的头。所以他说，以扫，出去，给我打猎，给我做饭，回来，我会让你成为头，我会正式祝福你。当以扫离开时，利百加听到了，利百加让雅各乔装打扮，以撒最终祝福了雅各，并说，你的兄弟将服侍你。实际上在不知情的情况下，确认了主的旨意，以扫稍后进来并说，我在这里，以撒开始颤抖。以撒说，等一下，如果你是以扫，雅各在这里，我让他成为头。我给了他祝福，我给了他长子的名分。

现在，有趣的是，圣经告诉我们在那一点上，如果你记得，是的，创世记 27 章 34 节，它说当以扫听到他父亲的话时，他大声哭泣。我知道一些事情，以撒也知道，那就是这个祝福的事情不是魔法。它不是魔法。显然是欺诈的，雅各欺骗了以撒，这并不意味着如果以撒愿意，以撒可以在那时转过身来说，好吧，等一下，等一下，那是一个欺诈的事情。我是盲目的，我没有意识到。你是头。他本可以那样做。我不会那样做，为什么？因为我认为在那时，以撒意识到了一些事情，而以扫在他的愤怒中没有意识到。以撒意识到他一生都在与神作斗争。以撒意识到神将会实现他的旨意。以撒对以扫说，不，我不能改变它。以撒意识到以扫在他的生活中是一个偶像。以撒意识到以扫比神更重要，以撒控制住了他的愤怒，而以扫却不能。我们被告知以扫对雅各怀有怨恨。利百加来到以扫和雅各那里，他说，以扫会在你父亲死后杀了你。以扫在用杀死你的想法安慰自己。这是怨恨的完美例子，也是一个很好的定义。他在安慰自己。当他想到如何斩首你时，他感觉更好。他怀有怨恨。雅各必须离开，除此之外没有必要再进一步，只需知道当以撒实际上在某种意义上对以扫宣布祝福时，他预测以扫将靠刀剑生活，以扫将继续成为一个被愤怒驱动的人。

### 现代例子

让我告诉你另一个家庭。一个名叫艾米·费德里基的女士住在纽约地区，她和她的家人是纽约时报一月份一篇重要文章的主题。她的生活相当艰难，因为当她 26 岁时，她结婚了，几周后她发现她的丈夫得了胰腺癌，几个月后他去世了，她在 26 岁时成为寡妇。一年后，她从曼哈顿的工作通勤回到她在长岛皇后区的家，她在车里，一个男人站起来，转身开始射击每个人，她是长岛铁路大屠杀中被杀的六个人之一。

她是一个非常亲密家庭的一部分，文章继续展示了这个家庭在整个悲剧中的反应是多么非凡。家庭做的第一件事就是捐赠艾米的器官给三个人并拯救了他们的生命。器官捐赠的专家指出，这个家庭是如此奇怪，因为通常，当一个家庭能够在危机、悲剧、悲痛、事故的时刻捐赠器官时，他们通常无法忍受看到获得器官的人。他们不想与他们建立关系，他们甚至不想见到他们，但这个家庭接触了那些人，把他们带入他们的生活，现在是非常好的朋友，你知道，这在纽约时报中是典型的。

真正的故事是这样的，这些人从哪里得到这种自制力？这是时报中所说的，听这个。它说，许多参与这场悲剧的人变得苦涩，而这个家庭却选择了宽恕。重生的基督徒，这个家庭温和地谈论弗格森先生。我们为那个人祈祷了很多，他们说。他们的态度对其他人来说完全令人惊讶，其中一个器官接受者说，我永远无法如此宽恕。

有趣的是，这个家庭看到了死亡背后的死亡，看到了作恶者背后的邪恶，并释放并将他们的愤怒发泄在死亡和邪恶上，而不是在作恶者身上。结果，他们的愤怒没有消耗他们，控制他们，让他们被困在过去，而是他们利用愤怒做了一些巨大的好事。

### 理解愤怒

两个不同的家庭。一个在圣经中，一个就在纽约。秘诀是什么？你如何确保你的愤怒不会囚禁你和控制你？你如何确保你能控制它？希伯来书的作者给了我们一些原则，我只是简单提一下。

首先，它告诉你愤怒是什么，然后其次，它告诉你三种处理愤怒的方法。让我们看看它们。我们不能花我们想要的时间，但至少让我们列出它们。

首先，愤怒是什么，你知道它告诉我们关于愤怒的什么吗？它说以扫是淫乱和不敬虔的，他有苦毒的根。现在，淫乱可能是一个不好的翻译，可能更好地翻译为叛教，但有趣的词是他是不敬虔的，这也不是一个很好的翻译。这个词字面意思是世俗，一个专注于当下的人。

现在，让我用一种非常鲜明的方式来表达，我的意思是，我们可以用一种抽象的原则来表达。我们可以说，愤怒总是与您的关注点有关，但让我用一种更鲜明的方式来表达，它会引起你的注意。**愤怒总是爱的结果。** 愤怒是激发你并召集你所有的能力来捍卫你最终所爱的东西。你对某件事的爱程度决定了你的愤怒程度。愤怒是捍卫你所爱的东西受到威胁的东西。你的爱的层次就是你的愤怒的层次。你一点也不爱的东西在受到威胁时不会让你生气。你稍微爱一点的东西在受到威胁时会让你有点生气。你非常爱的东西在受到威胁时会让你非常生气。你有多爱就有多生气，当你所爱的东西受到威胁时你就会生气。这就是愤怒是什么。

这就是为什么看到这一点非常重要的原因，这非常尴尬。当我们看到巨大的不公正在发生时，我们会有点生气，而当我们一天的计划完全被打乱时，我们会感到愤怒。当神生气时，他一直对罪感到愤怒，为什么？因为他爱正义，爱美好，他爱他的创造，而罪正在摧毁它。当以扫生气时，是因为他爱他的肚子，他爱权力，他爱现在。

看，我们这样说，突然间变得非常尴尬，并且非常具有启发性，它显示了两个快速的事情，两个快速的小事情。当我们意识到愤怒是捍卫你所爱的东西的功能，并且你爱某件事的程度时，你会看到你真正爱的东西的方式是跟随你的愤怒，跟随你的愤怒。你最生气的是什么，你最愤怒的是什么，你有点愤怒的是什么，以及你根本不愤怒的是什么，这将告诉你你稍微爱什么，你不爱什么，你最爱什么。

我之所以说它非常具有启发性，是因为它告诉我们两件事。首先，它向我们展示了为什么圣经中的愤怒本身不是罪。哦，不，不是。神生气，耶稣生气，他们是完美的。事实上，在诗篇 4 和以弗所书 4 中，我们被告知这一点，基督徒被告知，要生气，但不要犯罪，要生气。你知道圣经中至少有两个地方，以弗所书 4 和其他地方，基督徒被命令要生气，你知道为什么吗？如果你从不对任何事情生气，这意味着你什么都不爱。事实上，圣经说，在许多情况下，未能生气是一种罪，因为未能去爱。

周围有很多人说，哦，我是基督徒，我不生气。这是一种东方或异教的斯多葛主义，不是基督教，你永远不会看到圣经这样谈论愤怒。斯多葛派，你知道，马可·奥勒留，甚至许多东方宗教说，重要的是，如果你想拥有力量和控制，如果你想成为一个强大的人，不要让任何事情影响你，永远不要让他们看到你出汗，永远不要让他们看到你。你知道那是什么吗？是的，那给了你力量，但它杀死了你的人性。圣经说，如果你从不生气，这意味着你已经让自己对除什么之外的一切都无动于衷？你的自我控制，突然间重要的是我从未受到影响，那是你唯一爱的东西是你的平衡，这就是为什么你从不生气。这是一个非常错误的说法，基督徒从不生气。如果你从不生气，这表明你应该爱的东西，你不爱。

生气。如果你从不生气，那是一种罪，但它也告诉我们愤怒是如何出错的。愤怒是如何出错的。当你生活中最重要的事情也恰好是现实中最重要的事情时，当你生气时，因为正义被践踏，因为神的形象和人被践踏。当你看到人们被残酷地使用时，你知道他们作为神形象中的人的尊严，当你看到人类尊严被践踏时，当你看到不公正被践踏时，当你看到真理被践踏时，当你看到神的名字被践踏时，这些事情是宇宙中最重要的事情，当宇宙中最重要的事情也是你心中最重要的事情时，当你对它们生气时，你会发现你的愤怒不会控制你。你控制它。它是有用的。它有效。它帮助你专注于你想做的事情。它帮助你专注。

但如果你最终爱的东西不是最终重要的，你会发现你的愤怒是一种让你为那些虚假的终极爱服务的方式。愤怒总是你最爱的东西把你锁链在它们的服务中。让我，这让我们回到我们在开始时看到的主题。你知道，我们一直在做这个主题，关于罪，在整个四旬期，实际上整个冬天。我们之前已经提出了这个原则，我们再一次提出。你不明白它是如何工作的吗？我们说，罪是让我们把事情看得比神更重要的东西。罪是让你的心说，如果我结婚了，事情会真的很快乐。如果我有孩子，或者如果我成功了，或者如果这些人接受我，或者如果我有钱，或者如果我有专业声望，我们所有人都有一些我们提升到神之上的东西。我们说，如果我有那个，我会快乐。我们谈到了这一点。但现在你看，这就是愤怒是什么。当这些事情中的任何一个受到威胁时，你的愤怒就会上升，你被锁链在那件事上。你无法停止。你失控了。它囚禁了你。当某些东西介于你和这件事之间时，你说，我必须拥有才能快乐，那就是愤怒出现的时候，那种愤怒会作恶。那种愤怒会囚禁。那种愤怒会控制你，而不是你控制它。那种愤怒会利用你，而不是你利用它。那种愤怒会做你，而不是你做它。那种愤怒会消耗你，而不是你消耗它。好吧。那么你如何处理愤怒呢？这样你就可以消耗它而不是它消耗你。你如何处理愤怒？好吧，这里有三件事在希伯来书中被列出。你必须做的三件事。三个原则。好的。

第一个相当简单，但很重要。你需要意识到你生活中的愤怒。这似乎很明显，但这里的比喻是，它称苦毒为根。现在为什么称它为根？它称它为根，因为根是看不见的。这是我们通常发生的事情。我们不想相信我们是愤怒的人。你知道，当某人让我们极度愤怒时，我们讨厌承认那件事对我们有多重要。愤怒是一种方式，你知道，当愤怒出现时，你的失误就显露出来了。你知道，当你知道有人伤害了你的名声时，你会感到愤怒，你不想让人们知道你的名声对你有多重要。当工作中出了问题时，你感到愤怒，你不想让人们知道那个项目对你有多重要，你不想让人们知道。事实上，你自己也不想相信。所以我们所做的是我们只是摆脱它。我们只是把它塞住。我们说，我不生气。我们心里有一部分说，我想得到那个人，但我们说，不，不。我原谅了他们。这是一种让你感到控制自己生活的方式。但发生的事情是根在那里。你会发现那个根会玷污你，它说，它最终会成长。它会扭曲你的生活，除非你愿意看到你真的有愤怒。人们一直在说，我不是一个愤怒的人。我不是一个愤怒的人。我不是一个愤怒的人。突然，合适的机会，可能有一个根在那里，整个树都在那里。整个树，但它有点冷，或者没有足够的雨。但合适的机会来了，合适的条件，突然树就长出来了。你对自己说，我不生气。我不生气。我不生气。突然，一个陷阱门打开了，愤怒就出来了。我不生气。我不生气。突然，你看到它扭曲了你的生活。你们中的一些人是愤世嫉俗的人。你不知道那是什么吗？那是苦毒。你被某人伤害了，你要通过不再信任任何人来回报世界。这是苦毒。有些人对我说，我永远不会成为基督徒，因为我见过这样的伪君子。换句话说，你对那些伤害你和让你失望的人的苦毒，现在正在扭曲。它正在玷污你。我曾经见过一个人，他讨厌日本人。他在二战期间的一个战俘营里，他现在讨厌日本人。你知道吗？他现在比那时更被囚禁。唯一一个伤害你的人能够真正继续控制你的方式是如果你继续对他们生气。如果你继续对某人生气，那种苦毒正在玷污你。它正在控制你。它正在控制你现在的行为。他们赢了。邪恶赢了。你被玷污了。你打算怎么做？首先，要意识到它。意识到。我有些人对我说，好吧，现在我不想伤害那个人。你确定吗？通常人们的意思是，我原谅了，这意味着我不会试图伤害他们，但你想听到别人这样做吗？你想听到有人这样做吗？你想听到他们受伤了吗？他们被打倒了吗？你说，当然我会。这是一个根。

第二个原则是这样的。第一个原则是你必须意识到。你必须愿意承认它在那里。你必须愿意承认它。你必须愿意看到它。第二个原则非常重要。第二个原则是你必须愿意，我想，去做一个有神的人，而不是无神的人。这是什么意思？问问自己。问问自己。当你发现自己真的很生气时，问，"我在捍卫什么？"在圣灵的帮助下，你的愤怒可能无法承受这个问题，如果你愿意深入。"我在捍卫什么？"你知道，我喜欢高效。如果我准备的日子，准备讲道和类似的事情被打断，我会很生气。我必须问自己，我在捍卫什么？好吧，我说，我只是想高效。但看看那里发生了什么。我必须对自己说，如果你今天达到了你的目标，如果你完成了你想要完成的一切，在心灵的某个深处，你会说，我是一个有能力的人。我应该成为教会的高级牧师。如果我没有做到，我会说，我什么都不是。我是不足的。我是无能的。如果有人介于我和我的目标之间，我会感到愤怒。我必须说，我在捍卫什么？神在耶利米书 45 章中来到巴鲁克。他对巴鲁克说，巴鲁克很沮丧。他想要一个作为学者和抄写员的美好职业。但因为他与耶利米联系在一起，耶利米完全与体制对立，每个人都反对耶利米。所以每个人都反对巴鲁克，巴鲁克的职业生涯正在走下坡路。他感到沮丧和愤怒。神来到巴鲁克，对他说，不要为自己寻求伟大的事情。他说，巴鲁克，如果你让你的职业比我更重要，你总是会生气。这就是你是一个愤怒的人的原因。让我成为你的成功。你会自由的。让我成为你的成功。你不明白吗？不要为自己寻求伟大的事情。当你生气时，问自己，我在捍卫什么？是什么？我怎么会变得世俗？我怎么会专注于当下？次要的事情怎么会变得对我来说是终极的？我不会被这些事情控制。我不会寻求这些事情。这些事情会通过愤怒囚禁我。我不会。我不会。我不会。

最后。所以第一个原则是你必须意识到你生活中的根。其次，你必须愿意成为有神的人。这意味着你不能只是说，我不应该生气。我不应该生气。我不应该生气。相反，你必须深入，问，为什么生产力？哦，Tim Keller，为什么你的生产力对你来说如此重要？哦，巴鲁克，为什么你的职业对你来说如此重要？你说，仅仅说，为什么我这么生气是不够的？我不应该生气。基督徒不生气。你必须深入。你怎么会变得无神？失控的愤怒，控制你的愤怒，多年来扭曲你生活的愤怒是一种无神的形式，或者你可能会说是一种虚假的有神形式，把正确的神放回它应该在的地方。

最后，看，它说，不要让任何人错过神的恩典。不要让任何苦毒的根生长。看到最后的原则了吗？恩典和苦毒相互排斥。它们是绝对的对立面。它们就像火和水。当你把火和水放在一起时，要么火比水大，它蒸发了水，要么水比火大，它熄灭了火，但它们不能在一起。要么你对恩典的理解会熄灭你的苦毒，要么苦毒会阻止你理解恩典。它们不能共存。你知道为什么吗？当耶稣基督在十字架上时，在他为我们的罪付出代价之后，他说，"成了"，意思是，它被翻译为，"完成了"。它完成了，但它也可以翻译为，"已支付"，因为这是一个经济术语，但他真正说的是，我完成了支付。你知道他做了什么吗？我对地狱了解不多，但我知道这一点。我对地狱了解不多，但我知道这一点。地狱是无尽的。这意味着什么？这意味着我们对神的债务，我们欠神的债务是如此之大，以至于我们永远无法完成支付。让我们暂时不考虑其他任何事情。暂时不考虑你可能对地狱有的所有其他问题，但只需意识到地狱是永恒的。这就是说你的支付永远不会完成，然而当耶稣基督为我们死在十字架上时，他完成了支付。这一定意味着他在十字架上经历的东西远比你我在地狱中永远经历的要糟糕得多。

唯一的方式和完美的方式和绝对的方式来处理人们欠你的东西，你如何原谅人们？你如何说他们欠我？我原谅。他们欠我，但我放手。他们欠我，但我不会要求支付。你必须让你欠神的东西绝对地压倒他们欠你的东西在你的心中。你必须说，看他支付了什么。他没有要求我支付我所欠的。成了。这是奇怪的事情。如果你要求人们支付，如果你在他们的心上插针，或者如果你只是在他们的心中插针，如果你避免他们，或者如果你试图控制他们说，你欠我。如果你给他们小小的挖苦，如果你给其他人小小的挖苦，如果你说，我原谅了你，但这实际上是你通过你的正义怜悯来显示你是多么好的人，有数百种方式让他们支付。耶稣没有让你支付。如果你试图让其他人支付，它永远不会完成。他们会变得越来越穷，而你会变得越来越穷。但如果你看到耶稣说成了，已支付，那么你可以转向其他人说，成了。我不会让你支付。他没有让我支付。你必须看到耶稣那样死去。如果你这样做，它就会结束。它将完成。你将能够说，正如他原谅了我，我原谅他们。你能做到吗？你知道，整个事情的伟大讽刺是成为一个更好的人是对人们说，你欠我。我的父母，他们欠我。我的孩子，他们欠我。这个机构欠我。这些人欠我。他们欠我。这是多么讽刺。圣经说，如果你坚持他们的账目，如果你不撕毁它们，如果你坚持那些账目，讽刺的是，圣经说你会变得越来越穷。看看耶稣基督。当他支付你的账目时，而不是要求支付，他看起来穷吗？他是富有的。他下来，对吗？他倒空了自己。他支付了代价。因此，神高度尊崇他。伟大的讽刺。如果你要求支付，你会变得越来越穷。如果你支付，你最终会变得富有。你最终会自由。你最终会找到那个家庭找到的同样的自由，甚至纽约时报也无法不注意到。其他人也会注意到你。不要为自己寻求伟大的事情。让我们祷告。
