### Introduction: The Difference Between a Morally Restrained Heart and a Supernaturally Changed Heart

The Bible says there's a world of difference between a will-power-driven heart and a supernaturally-changed one. Today, Tim Keller is unpacking one of the fruit of the Spirit, helping us see what it means to move from trying to be good to truly changing from the inside out.

The Scripture reading comes from Romans 5 verses 1 through 11. Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God, not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings because we know that suffering produces perseverance, perseverance, character, and character hope. And hope does not disappoint us because God has poured out His love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit whom He has given us. You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly. Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though, for a good man, someone might possibly dare to die. But God demonstrates His own love for us in this. All we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since we have now been justified by His blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through Him? Or if, when we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to Him through the death of His Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through His life? Not only is this so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation. This is God's Word.

The premise of the Bible, well, there's a lot of premises, but the premise we're thinking about today, tonight, one of the premises of the Bible is that there's a difference between a morally restrained heart and a supernaturally changed heart. There's a difference between using your willpower to suppress your self-centeredness and your fearfulness as another thing, to have the Holy Spirit permanently change your heart, not through the power of willpower, but through the power of the Spirit itself. And Himself.

### Part One: The Importance of Joy

#### 1. Joy as a Mark of Justified Believers

What we're going to be looking at over the next few weeks is a series of characteristics of a supernaturally changed heart. How do you know whether you're just trying to be good or whether the Holy Spirit's really brought transformation into your life? The way to do that is to look at what's called the fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 5. Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness. There's a whole set of traits or characteristics of a supernaturally changed heart, and each week we're looking at one of them. And tonight, we're looking at joy. And this passage, in Galatians 5, 1 to 11, tells us three things about joy. It tells us that joy is important. It tells us that joy is, secondly, Christian joy is unique, and then thirdly, it tells us where Christian joy comes from. It's important, Christian joy is unique, and where it comes from.

**Number one, that joy is important.** Verse 1 talks about justification by faith. Therefore, since we've been justified by faith, we have peace with God. And what Paul's doing there is he's referring to everything he's been talking about in chapters 1 to 4. And what does this justification by faith mean? Every other religion says, live as you ought, and then God will bless and accept you. But only Christianity says, you receive as acceptance and blessings of free gift through faith, because of Jesus' record, not your record. And then you can and will live as you want. Total reversal, very revolutionary.

> "The main mark of justified believers is joy."

John Stott, who's written a commentary on the book of Romans, says, it seems clear from this paragraph that the main mark of justified believers is joy. The major main mark, which means this text is saying that to live a Christian life, in fact, to live life, you need a center of joy, an enormous joy at your very center.

### Part Two: The Uniqueness of Christian Joy

#### 1. Joy Not Based on Circumstances

Christian joy is unique, and Christian joy gets you out of the dilemma. How so? There's two ways the Christian joy is unique. And the first one is that Christian joy is not based in circumstances at all. Look, what does it say in verse three? It says, we rejoice in our sufferings. What? Now what are sufferings? Sufferings, suffering is favorable circumstances going away.

**Christian joy can grow when things are bad.**

#### 2. Already But Not Yet

Christian joy is unique because it's already but not yet. Look, on the one hand, verse 2b says, we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God. Now what's that mean? It means when you become a Christian because your salvation is not based in your good works and your efforts. There's a certainty you've got about your future.

### Part Three: How to Obtain Christian Joy

#### 1. Understanding the Gospel

How do you really get this joy? Because I've been all long saying Christian joy is like this and Christian joy is like that. Well, how do you get Christian joy? You say, well, I guess become a Christian. Well, let's be a little more specific because I know an awful lot of Christians that don't have much of the joy.

**The gospel shows you the magnitude of your danger.**

#### 2. Meditating on Jesus' Sacrifice

You look and say, Lord Jesus, you lost all joy that I could have eternal joy. You experience enormous anguish so I could have new life. And that's how the love comes.

Let's pray. Thank you, Father, for giving us joy and giving us the capacity for far greater joy than we have. Lord, I pray that anyone here who has not really come on to the inside of belief in the gospel has not really received it, has not really accepted it, has not really come to know you by faith. It's not really experienced justification. I pray that they would and that they would therefore begin to understand this joy. Joy in the face of the future, joy in the face of suffering, joy before you. But I also pray, Lord, for all the rest of us who already believe, but to great degree are relying on worldly circumstances for our happiness. Give us this joy, root us and ground us in joy. Give us an experience of your love so that we can have the joy that Jesus had for the joy that was set before him. He endured the cross. And for the joy that you have given us we can do or anything because he endured that for us. It's in his name that we pray. Amen.

### 引言：道德约束的心与超自然改变的心的区别

圣经说，意志力驱动的心与超自然改变的心之间有天壤之别。今天，Tim Keller 正在解读圣灵的果子之一，帮助我们看到从努力做好事到真正从内心改变的意义。

经文来自罗马书 5 章 1 到 11 节。因此，我们既因信称义，就借着我们的主耶稣基督与神相和。我们又借着他，因信得进入现在所站的这恩典中，并且欢欢喜喜盼望神的荣耀。不但如此，就是在患难中也是欢欢喜喜的。因为知道患难生忍耐，忍耐生老练，老练生盼望。盼望不至于羞耻，因为所赐给我们的圣灵将神的爱浇灌在我们心里。因我们还软弱的时候，基督就按所定的日期为罪人死。为义人死，是少有的，为仁人死，或者有敢作的。惟有基督在我们还作罪人的时候为我们死，神的爱就在此向我们显明了。现在我们既靠着他的血称义，就更要借着他免去神的忿怒。因为我们作仇敌的时候，且借着神儿子的死得与神和好，既已和好，就更要因他的生得救了。不但如此，我们既借着我主耶稣基督得与神和好，也就借着他以神为乐。这是神的话。

圣经的前提，嗯，有很多前提，但我们今天晚上要思考的前提之一是，道德约束的心与超自然改变的心之间的区别。使用意志力来压抑自我中心和恐惧是一回事，而让圣灵永久改变你的心，不是通过意志力的力量，而是通过圣灵本身的力量，是另一回事。

### 第一部分：喜乐的重要性

#### 1. 称义信徒的标志

在接下来的几周里，我们将研究超自然改变的心的一系列特征。你如何知道你只是努力做好事，还是圣灵真的在你的生命中带来了转变？方法是查看加拉太书 5 章中所谓的圣灵的果子。爱、喜乐、和平、忍耐、恩慈。有一整套超自然改变的心的特征或特性，每周我们都会研究其中之一。今晚，我们要看的是喜乐。加拉太书 5 章 1 到 11 节告诉我们关于喜乐的三件事。它告诉我们喜乐很重要。其次，它告诉我们基督徒的喜乐是独特的，然后第三，它告诉我们基督徒的喜乐来自哪里。它很重要，基督徒的喜乐是独特的，以及它来自哪里。

**第一，喜乐很重要。** 第 1 节谈到因信称义。因此，既因信称义，就与神相和。保罗在这里所做的是指他在第 1 到 4 章中所谈论的一切。因信称义是什么意思？其他所有宗教都说，按你应当的方式生活，然后神会祝福和接纳你。但只有基督教说，你通过信心接受作为免费礼物的接纳和祝福，因为耶稣的记录，而不是你的记录。然后你可以并且将按你想要的方式生活。完全的颠覆，非常革命性。

> "称义信徒的主要标志是喜乐。"

约翰·斯托特在他所写的罗马书注释中说，很明显，从这一段中可以看出，称义信徒的主要标志是喜乐。主要的标志，这意味着这段经文在说，要过基督徒的生活，实际上，要过生活，你需要一个喜乐的中心，一个在你内心深处的巨大喜乐。

### 第二部分：基督徒喜乐的独特性

#### 1. 喜乐不基于环境

基督徒的喜乐是独特的，基督徒的喜乐让你摆脱困境。怎么会这样？基督徒的喜乐有两个独特之处。第一个是基督徒的喜乐根本不基于环境。看，第 3 节说什么？它说，我们在患难中也是欢欢喜喜的。什么？那么什么是患难？患难是不利环境的消失。

**基督徒的喜乐可以在逆境中增长。**

#### 2. 已经但尚未

基督徒的喜乐是独特的，因为它是已经但尚未。看，一方面，第 2 节 b 说，我们欢欢喜喜盼望神的荣耀。这是什么意思？这意味着当你成为基督徒时，因为你的救恩不是基于你的善行和努力。你对未来有一种确定性。

### 第三部分：如何获得基督徒的喜乐

#### 1. 理解福音

你如何真正获得这种喜乐？因为我一直在说基督徒的喜乐是这样的，基督徒的喜乐是那样的。那么，你如何获得基督徒的喜乐？你说，好吧，我想成为基督徒。好吧，让我们更具体一点，因为我知道很多基督徒并没有太多的喜乐。

**福音显示了你危险的严重性。**

#### 2. 默想耶稣的牺牲

你看着说，主耶稣，你失去了一切喜乐，以便我可以拥有永恒的喜乐。你经历了巨大的痛苦，以便我可以拥有新的生命。这就是爱的来临。

让我们祷告。感谢天父赐给我们喜乐，并赐给我们远超我们所拥有的更大的喜乐的能力。主，我祈求这里的任何人，如果他们还没有真正进入福音的信仰内部，还没有真正接受它，还没有真正接受它，还没有通过信心真正认识你，还没有真正经历称义。我祈求他们会这样做，因此开始理解这种喜乐。面对未来的喜乐，面对苦难的喜乐，在你面前的喜乐。但我也祈求，主，为我们所有已经相信的人，但在很大程度上依赖于世俗环境来获得快乐的人。赐给我们这种喜乐，使我们在喜乐中扎根并立足。赐给我们你的爱的体验，以便我们可以拥有耶稣所拥有的喜乐，因为他为了摆在面前的喜乐忍受了十字架。因为你赐给我们的喜乐，我们可以忍受任何事情，因为他为我们忍受了这一切。我们奉他的名祷告。阿门。
