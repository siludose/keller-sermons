## English Transcript / 英文原文

Today, Tim Keller is unpacking one of the fruit  of the Spirit, helping us see what it means to move from trying to be good to truly  changing from the inside out. The Scripture reading comes from Romans 5 verses 1 through 11. Therefore, since we have  been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through  whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we rejoice  in the hope of the glory of God, not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings because  we know that suffering produces perseverance, perseverance, character, and character hope. And hope does not disappoint us because God has poured out His love into our hearts by  the Holy Spirit whom He has given us.

You see, at just the right time, when we were still  powerless, Christ died for the ungodly. Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man,  though, for a good man, someone might possibly dare to die. But God demonstrates His own  love for us in this. All we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since we have now been  justified by His blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through Him?

Or if, when we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to Him through the death of His Son,  how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through His life? Not only is this  so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now  received reconciliation. This is God's Word. The premise of the Bible, well, there's a lot of premises, but the premise we're thinking  about today, tonight, one of the premises of the Bible is that there's a difference  between a morally restrained heart and a supernaturally changed heart. There's a difference  between using your willpower to suppress your self-centeredness and your fearfulness as  another thing, to have the Holy Spirit permanently change your heart, not through the power of  willpower, but through the power of the Spirit itself.

And Himself. However, what we're going  to be looking at over the next few weeks is a series of characteristics of a supernaturally  changed heart. How do you know whether you're just trying to be good or whether the Holy  Spirit's really brought transformation into your life? The way to do that is to look  at what's called the fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 5. Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness.

There's a whole set of traits or characteristics of a supernaturally changed heart, and each  week we're looking at one of them. And tonight, we're looking at joy. And this passage,  in Galatians 5, 1 to 11, tells us three things about joy. It tells us that joy is important. It tells us that joy is, secondly, Christian joy is unique, and then thirdly, it tells us  where Christian joy comes from.

It's important, Christian joy is unique, and where it comes  from. Number one, that joy is important. Verse 1 talks about justification by faith. Therefore, since we've been justified by faith, we have peace with God. And what Paul's  doing there is he's referring to everything he's been talking about in chapters 1 to 4.

And what does this justification by faith mean? Every other religion says, live as you  ought, and then God will bless and accept you. But only Christianity says, you receive  as acceptance and blessings of free gift through faith, because of Jesus' record, not your  record. And then you can and will live as you want. Total reversal, very revolutionary.

And to be a Christian is to someone who's now justified by faith. You have peace with  God. You're accepted by him because of what Jesus has done. And now what is the main  mark of a real Christian life? What's the main characteristic?

And according to chapter  5, 1 to 11, look, it says in verse 2b, it says, now we rejoice, joy in the hope of the  glory of God. And then in verse 3, not only this, we rejoice in our suffering. And then  down to verse 11, it says, and we rejoice in God. So John Stott, who's written a commentary  on the book of Romans, says, it seems clear from this paragraph that the main mark of  justified believers is joy. The major main mark, which means this text is saying that  to live a Christian life, in fact, to live life, you need a center of joy, an enormous  joy at your very center.

Now a lot of people don't believe that. A lot of people don't  believe that. A lot of people are afraid the pursuing joy is a dead end. For example, Amy  Bloom, over the last few years, by the way, there's been a lot of happiness studies, happiness  psychology. Have you seen those?

Lots of books trying to explore what makes us happy and  how we can be happy. And there's tons and tons of books on positive thinking and how  you can get control of your life so you can be happy. And by and large, the intelligentsia,  you know, the intellectuals and the writers and the pundits and the artists and the philosophers  hate all of that talk. Amy Bloom just a couple of months ago wrote this in the New York Times  essay. The name of the essay was The Wrap on Happiness.

And here's what she says. She says  the fashion, she says this, excuse me, quote, smart people talk trash about happiness and  worse than trash about books on happiness. And we have done so for centuries because happiness  studies and positive psychology, we don't see as being the work of the devil, but the work  of morons. And then she goes on to explain some of the reasons why. But here's the main one.

She says the real problem with happiness is not as pursuers or their books. It's happiness  itself. It's transience. It's deep but often brief. The world passes away from us.

The  petals fall and the beloved dies. And no amount of fashionable scowling will keep us from  savoring the pleasure of the sun on our faces or save us from our adult understanding that  it cannot last. Now what she's saying is this, if you really want serenity in life, don't  pursue happiness because anything you get joy from will not last. When no matter what  it is, it's going to disappoint you. So the only way to get serenity is not to try  to be happy.

Not to try to pursue joy. Now look, I understand this. When I was a 13-year-old  boy in the summer of 1964, okay, do the math. My team was the Philadelphia Phillies. And with  12 games to go, they were six games ahead of the second place St.

Louis Cardinals in the  National League. 12 games to go. Six games ahead. They're going to go to the World Series. And then they proceeded, some of you historians know, to lose 10 in a row. 10 games in a row. And they lost and they never went to the World Series.

Now when you're a 13-year-old boy  and that's your team, those 10 games, I lived through every pitch, every at bat, every out. I was dying a thousand deaths. I was experiencing an agony that no 13-year-old boy believed was possible. And when it was done, and my heart was literally broken, and you know what, okay, we're laughing,  but you know, it was awful. What I said was, never again.

I am never giving my heart to,  okay, fill in the blank because you see, all of us have something like that. Now,  you know, there are people who to this day are not past the emotional level of a 13-year-old boy  and it's still sports teams that are breaking their hearts. But for most of the rest of it,  it's what? I'm never going to, you know, it's a man or a woman or it's love or it's career,  it's success or something like that. And what happens is because our hearts want joy and our  hearts are like a big vacuum pump that has this enormous amount of sucking and it fixes itself  on something that this is going to make me happy.

And when it disappoints, then it will disappoint. See, it will not last. Then you say, okay, the only way I'm ever going to get serenity is to stop  pursuing joy and get what the philosopher is called detachment. In fact, that's what Buddhism is about. Buddhism is all about that.

And the old philosophers, the Greek philosophers, we're always about  detachment. Don't give your heart to anything. And that's the only way you'll be serene. Don't pursue  joy. Don't pursue happiness.

But there's a problem with that. Joseph Epstein, who's a brilliant scholar,  has taught English at Northwestern University for years, he was the editor of the American scholar  and he's just retired. But recently, he wrote an article in the Notre Dame magazine. And in it,  he recounts one of the great Greek philosophers, ancient Greek philosophers named Epicurus. And at one point, Epicurus got his disciples together in his garden and said, I can give you a  four step remedy for anxiety.

I can eliminate anxiety from your life. You can just be completely  serene if you just do these four things. He says, I can eliminate anxiety in the world if everybody  will do these four things. Would you like to know what they are? All right, well, okay.

Well, here's, and this is what Epstein says. He says, this is his summary of Epicurus' four steps. Step one, do not believe in God or in the gods. Okay, why? Okay, step two.

Therefore, now you don't  have to worry about death. Death, be assured, is oblivion. Nothing more than eternal dreamless sleep. See, there's no God or God. There's no heaven or hell.

You know, therefore, don't believe in God  or gods. Therefore, death is not nothing to be afraid of. Go and you die. It's like before you  were born, just an eternal dreamless sleep. Step three, don't be afraid of pain.

Why? Because pain  will either soon diminish and go away, or it will intensify in which case death is not far away  and as we've already seen, that's no problem. And now step four, do not attempt to acquire things  or money or fame or power. Why? Don't try, don't set your heart on anything.

Because if you,  because if you try for them, you may not attain them, which of course will mean you're very unhappy. But even if you do, he says, they never give you the value that is as great as what you spent trying  to obtain them. The game is not worth the candle. So there's the summary and Epstein summarizes  Epicurus' four steps for an anxiety-free life. He says, forget about God, forget about death,  forget about pain and forget about acquisition.

And then he says, the only way to find serenity,  according to the philosophers, is to stop seeking joy. Detach yourself from everything. Don't  attach your heart to anything. And here is what Epstein says. Conclusion, my guess is that this  program would work.

But even if it did work, would such utter detachment from life constitute a life  rich and complex enough to be worth living for? Many would say, yes, I am not among them. Now, actually, C. S. Lewis has said a little bit more eloquently.

He says, if you don't want your  heart to be broken, if you always want serenity, don't give your heart to anything. Don't give it to  the Philadelphia Phillies. Don't give it to anything. Don't give it to a man or woman, anything. Oh, he does mean you can't get married, but don't completely give your heart to anyone or anything.

Put it in a little casket. You see, to make sure that it never breaks, but in that casket,  it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, and irredeemable. And see, what Epstein is saying,  what C. S. Lewis is saying is, yes, on the one hand, if you give your heart to things, you're  going to be disappointed.

So if you seek joy, you're going to be disappointed. But on the other hand,  if you detach yourself and say, I'm not giving my heart to anything, that dehumanizes you. It hardens you. Well, is there any way forward now? The answer is yes.

Why? Because it's a sermon,  and that's only point one. Now there's point two. And point two is Christian joy is unique,  and Christian joy gets you out of the dilemma. How so?

There's two ways the Christian joy is unique. And the first one is that Christian joy is not based in circumstances at all. Look, what does it  say in verse three? It says, we rejoice in our sufferings. What?

Now what are sufferings? Sufferings,  suffering is favorable circumstances going away. Now here's the place where I think I'm going to  part ways with the word happiness, if you don't mind, because I actually don't believe that Christian  joy is what the world calls happiness. What the world calls happiness is, getting control of your  life so that you keep your circumstances favorable. Did you know that there is a happiness.com?

And at happiness.com, there is this, the surefire top five components for happiness. All right? Five things, if you get put these in place, you're happy. Number one, it says be in possession of  the basics. Food, shelter, good health, and in safety.

Number two, get enough sleep. All right. Sure, fine. Three, have relationships that matter to you, four, take compassionate care  of others and yourself, and five, have work that really interested engages you. Okay?

So get the  basics, food, shelter, good health. Do you realize how ridiculous that is? You say, what do you mean  ridiculous? Sure, you need all that to be happy. Sure, you need that to be happy.

Most people,  most places, most centuries have never had that. What are we going to do about all the people who  could never get enough food, shelter, good health, and safety today? They'll never will have it. You talk about engaging and interesting work. In other words, what this is saying, and this is  what the world believes, happiness is getting my circumstances in the right place.

I'm happy if  things are going well. Circumstances are favorable. But what about most of the people and most of  the times and most of the places that never have favorable circumstances like that? Are they doomed  to no happiness? Yes, they're doomed to no happiness as you and I define happiness in this culture  today.

A joy is available to them. And that Christian joy is not based on circumstances at all. In fact, look, when it says we rejoice in suffering, it doesn't mean, by the way, it's not saying  you rejoice for your suffering. You don't say, we, I'm suffering. Hey, that's great.

That's  masochism. Forget that way. It says we rejoice in our suffering. Well, how can you rejoice in  your suffering? Of all your circumstances are going bad.

Verse 11, you rejoice in God. And he's not susceptible. He's not subject to circumstances. But here's what's really  interesting about verse 3 and 4. It says, you rejoice in suffering with why?

Because suffering  produces stronger endurance. Perseverance means character and perseverance and encourage. And that leads to more hope. And that hope is in the future glory of God, which makes us rejoice  the verse 2 B says we rejoice in the future glory of God. We'll get there in a minute.

Verse 3 says  suffering can actually give you more of that hope and therefore more of that joy. And what this is  saying is, Christian joy, unlike worldly happiness, not only can be maintained when all circumstances  go unfavorable, but it can also grow. In fact, it does usually grow. You say, how can that be? Christian joy can grow when things are bad.

The worldly happiness goes away when things are bad. Why? Because it's based in good circumstances. But Christian joy can actually get stronger. How?

Well, don't you remember how your mother used to always say? Don't eat that candy before meals. You know, if she would ever want it anytime within about 30 minutes before you're about to eat,  you know, a meal, your mother would be all over if you're eating potato chips or candy or anything  sweet or anything like that. Why? She says, it'll ruin your appetite.

And mothers aren't always  right. Mothers are never in, you know, often wrong, but never in doubt. However, they are right about  this. And that is the trouble with eating candy is it gives you a sugar buzz and you don't feel hungry,  but it masks the fact that your body needs proteins and it needs all kinds of stuff that you don't have. Candy gives you a sugar buzz that masks the fact that your body needs nutrients that you're  not giving it and sex and money and power and success.

Favorable circumstances are spiritual sugar. And what happens to Christians is you say, oh, I believe in God and I know I'm going to heaven  whatever, but you actually base your day-to-day joy and happiness on circumstances and when the  circumstances go away, it drives you into God because when the sugar goes away, when the candy  goes away, you're forced to go after the feast that your soul really needs to get the nutrients  your soul really needs. What happens when things go bad is it drives you into God and you develop  a poise, you develop a power, you develop a strong kind of joy that never goes away regardless  of circumstances. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God. Even Jesus relied on the  Psalms to face every situation, including death.

In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365-day devotional,  the songs of Jesus, you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start and if you  already spend time and study in prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you  bring your deepest emotions and questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with him. We'll send you Tim and Kathy Keller's devotional as our thanks for your gift to help Gospel  and Life share the love of Jesus with more people.

It's not grounded in circumstances, but secondly, Christian joy is unique  because it's already but not yet. It's already but not yet. Look, on the one hand,  verse 2b says, we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God. Now what's that mean? It means when  you become a Christian because your salvation is not based in your good works and your efforts.

There's a certainty you've got about your future. See, remember what we said about all the religions,  all of the religions say, if you live as you want, then God will bless you, which means in every  if you believe the reason God blesses me, the reason I believe I have a relationship with God is  because I've lived a good life and I'm living a good life and I'm praying and I'm doing all these  things. That means you have no certainty about your future, spiritually speaking because what if  you give up or what if you don't keep it up? You can't be sure because you haven't gotten  into your life yet and you might fail or you might do something. So religion in which your salvation  essentially is earned by you creates an uncertainty about your future.

But Christianity says there's  now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus and it's absolutely certain that someday  you will share in the hope of the glory of God that you'll live in the world before him and this  world is going to be completely renewed and when you get there, the moment you get there, you're  going to stamp your foot and you're going to say, I've come home at last. This is my real country. I belong here. This is the land I've been looking for all my life and I never knew it till now. And the knowledge of that, the knowledge of that, it's not yet but it's there, it's coming.

The word  hope in the Bible does not mean hope so, it's not an uncertainty. Hope in the Bible is life-shaping  certainty of something that you're going to have but you don't have it yet. But even the  stories about it and the thoughts about it and the biblical texts about it and our understanding  of that future is grounding. See, it's poised creating. When other circumstances are going away,  becoming unfavorable, we know about the hope of the glory of God.

That's not yet but is that all we have? We just know what's going to happen. We just think about it. So when we're suffering,  we just say, I know in the future it's going to be better. Is that it?

No, that's not all we have  because look carefully. Verse 4 and 5. It says, suffering produces perseverance and perseverance  character and character hope and our hope does not disappoint us why because God has poured out his  love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit who he has given us. What does that word pour out mean? Does that mean the Holy Spirit just tells us that God loves us?

Does that mean that we know that God  loves us? We already know God loves us. What is this talking about? The poor out metaphor  is a way of expressing experience. And this is saying that sometimes that feast that we know we're  going to have in the future, we get an order of now.

Sometimes that glory that we're going to have  in the future, sometimes you experience it now. And this is at the very heart of the Christian joy  that's available to you through Christ, through the faith of Christ, through the Holy Spirit. It's a foretaste of that glory. Some of the old people, I mean some of the old British  pastors like Richard Sibs and William Guthrie write about it like this. Listen, this is 17th  century English but so work with it.

Here he says, Richard Sibs says, sometimes our spirits cannot  stand in trials. So the immediate testimony of the Spirit comes to us saying, I am thy salvation  and our hearts are stirred up and comforted with joy inexpressible. This joy has degrees. Sometimes it's so clear and strong that we question nothing and other times doubts come in soon. William Guthrie says, it's not an audible voice.

We don't hear an audible voice. Rather, what we're talking about here is a ray of glory filling the soul. It's like the word of Jesus to Mary. The Lord only said her name in the garden, Mary. And it filled her soul so she no longer doubted she was his.

How glorious is this manifestation of the  Spirit. You will not have the Christian joy that roots and grounds you no matter what the circumstances. You will tend to simply rely on worldly happiness which is based on favorable circumstances which  of course is so fragile. You will not have the Christian joy unless sometimes you have experiences  of the love of God direct to your heart through prayer. It's the foretaste of that.

It's the  already foretaste of the not yet. And you heard what Richard said. It doesn't happen a lot. It doesn't happen constantly. Sometimes it's very high.

Sometimes it's kind of low and it goes  away fast. But you know it. When you have those experiences, I know it's weird to have a  Presbyterian minister saying this. When you have those experiences that goes along with your knowledge  because I know I'm saved by grace, I know that the glory of God is my destiny. And yet at the same  time I've got a subject that is well as an objective nature.

It might not only have my mind. I've got  my heart. And the Bible says Christian joy gives you what you need both head and heart. And do you not see now? How this in a sense answers the dilemma we talked about in the first point.

Because the first point dilemma is this. Things in this world are great. And yet if we give our heart  to them, then we get disappointed. So then we detach. And then we don't rejoice in things.

C.S. Lewis's autobiography is called Surprise by Joy. And it's all about the fact that before he  was a Christian, he was always trying to find joy in other things. And whenever he found something  he thought would give him joy, he binged on it. So for example, the first time he read an Icelandic  saga.

He loved it. And he started to say, oh I want to get that feeling back. I have when I read it. It  was so exciting. So what he did to do, he reads every Icelandic saga.

And then he goes and learns  old Norse so he can read it in the original. And yet as he works through it, he comes to realize  well somehow the joy I thought was going to give me never comes through. And then suddenly he gets  a friend. And you know sometimes there's nothing more wonderful than a great evening talking with  a friend. And you come back feeling so good.

And when he first made it, he would get a friend and  he would binge on the friend. Every night, let's get together. Let's talk. After a while the friend  saying, whoa, maybe not tonight. Or maybe not for a while.

He would binge. And at one point,  he becomes, he starts to realize that there's a god behind the joy. And as he was getting converted  as he was sort of moving toward becoming a Christian, he says this at one point. He says the book,  I came to realize that the books are the music in which I thought the beauty and the joy was located  betrayed me if I trusted in them. The joy was not in them.

It only came through them. These things, these things, the joy, the beauty, if they're mistaken for the thing itself,  the things that give it through which it comes. If they're mistaken for the thing itself,  they turn into dumb idols breaking the hearts of their worshipers. For they are not the joy itself,  these things that bring it. They are only the scent of a flower we haven't found yet.

The echo of a tune we have not heard yet. The news from a country we haven't visited yet. And at the very end, the last chapter, the last page of his autobiographies,  become a Christian. And here's what he says. It's very, very interesting.

He says, for many years,  he thought the joy is here, the joy is here. And he would go to that landscape or that set of  friends or that book or that writing or whatever. And then he came to realize it was from God. And the joy was coming through the things. And then he ends with this fascinating illustration.

I want to tell what I would give you because I think it actually answers the problem. He says, if you are lost in the woods, and you first come upon a signpost, it's a big deal. The one who first sees the signpost in the woods says, look, and the whole party gathers  around and stares and says, ah, finally, that's the direction. But if you found the road,  and if you're passing signposts every few miles, you don't stop and stare at the signposts. They encourage you.

And you will be grateful to the authority that set them up. But we will not stop and stare at the signposts or at least not too much,  though their pillars are of silver and their lettering is of gold. Why? Because we would rather be in  Jerusalem. See his point.

He says, if you really are lost when you find a signpost, you get  pretty excited about it. But when you know your way, when you know the thing to which the signpost  point, that's where you're on your way. And you don't stop and look at the signposts. And what  do you realize is food, friends, success, acclaim, popularity, money, all the things that we think,  if I have that, that's going to give me the joy, our signposts. So enjoy them.

Some of them are great. There are some of them are made of silver with letters of gold. But don't mistake the signposts  for what they're signing, the thing they're pointing to, which is the city of God, which is God  himself. And that gets you out of either being afraid of enjoying things in this life or at the  same time resting your heart too much in them. And let's final question.

How do you really get  this joy? Because I've been all long saying Christian joy is like this and Christian joy is  like that. Well, how do you get Christian joy? You say, well, I guess become a Christian. Well,  let's be a little more specific because I know an awful lot of Christians that don't have much of  the joy.

And here's what I'd like you to see. The last part of the passage, the last part,  is, you know, worth five or six sermons. And by the way, there's plenty of people who preach five  or six sermons on these, you know, verses. However, the essence of them is the gospel. And in  verses eight and nine, there's a beautiful little summary of what the gospel is while we were still  sinners Christ died for us.

That we might be saved from God's wrath. Now God's wrath  is it's not just crankiness. God's wrath is his judicial opposition to evil. His settled judicial  opposition to injustice and evil. And the human race deserves punishment because we have  participated in evil and injustice.

But Jesus Christ, while we were still sinners, that's grace. Not because we cleaned up our life. While we're still sinners, Jesus Christ took the wrath. He took  the condemnation. He took the punishment.

And that's the gospel. How does that bring joy? Two ways. And these are very important in their practical number one, the gospel shows you the magnitude of your  danger. Now this is counterintuitive because from the outside, the gospel, the first part of the  gospel, which is you're a sinner, you're lost, you deserve punishment, you deserve wrath.

That sounds  negative. Gee, why would you consider that negative? Well, of course it sounds negative. But you  know what that means on the inside. On the inside, we realize the size of the debt and the magnitude of  the danger we were in, which we weren't aware of before.

One preacher put it like this. He says,  imagine that you went away and a friend of yours was staying in your home. And when you came back,  your friend said, you know what? A bill came for you. And I opened it.

I hope you don't mind. And I saw what the bill was. And I paid it for you. I paid it out of my own money. And the  preacher says, okay, now, how should you respond?

And the answer is, you have no idea how to respond. You know why you don't know why you're out of respond? Because you don't know the size of the debt. You don't know how big the bill was. Was it postage due on this package?

Then you would have said,  oh, thank you. That was very kind of you. But what if the IRS finally found where you lived? And that was the bill for back taxes that you know you have no resources of your own  to fulfill that bill. And that was paid for.

In other words, the preacher says,  until you know the size of the bill and the size of the debt, you don't know whether you to say,  hi, thank you very much, were to fall at his feet as dead saying, you saved me. You don't know how  grateful to be. You don't know how joyful to be until you know how bad you bad off it was, right? And JC Ryle, the old Bishop of Liverpool says, one of the reasons why you get so upset  over the debts, your financial debts, your financial problems is you don't realize that the great  debt, the only debt that debt of sin, the only debt that could really sink you has been paid. And when you see that, then all other debts, no matter how great they seem to be, you are little.

You follow that. See, from the outside, the idea that you're more wicked than you ever did believe  and you deserve wrath, you deserve to be punished. That sounds like bad news from the inside. Once you believe in the gospel and you see that all those years, the sort of damnacles was over  your head and you never knew was about to fall. When you see the magnitude of the debt, the magnitude of  your danger and you realize what you were delivered from, it inflicts a joy on you that never goes away.

That is, if that sounds odd to you, it's because you're not deeply on the inside. You really  haven't come on the inside. You haven't really accepted that. If you accept the bad news of the  gospel that you're a sinner needing salvation from the inside, it creates a joy that says,  you know what? Okay, I've got debts.

I've got diseases, but the only debt that can really  sink me has been paid and the only disease that can really kill me eternally has been healed. And even cancer can't do that. It can't really sink me because if I belong to him, I've got the  hope of the glory of God. The real disease has been healed. The real debt has been cancelled.

And so the first thing that the gospel does is it shows you the magnitude  of your danger, but the second thing it shows you is the magnitude of Jesus' pain. There's a weird place, and I do consider it weird, in John chapter 16, where Jesus is trying to comfort  his disciples the night before he's about to die. And he's trying to say, look, look, you know,  this is going to be hard on you. But then he says, a woman giving birth to a child has pain because  her time has come. But when the baby is born, joy for a child is born into the world.

And so it is  with you. What is he saying? And I looked it up because every time I look at that passage,  I always look at the commentators to make sure I'm not imagining all the commentators agree. Jesus Christ is identifying with a woman. And here's what you have to remember.

Nowadays, most  women have babies have some pain, but there are these things called epidurals and things like that. But in those days, not only did women never give birth except through excruciating pain,  but women constantly died in childbirth all the time. And what that meant was the only way for a woman  to give birth to a new baby and the joy of a new life was for her to go into a tunnel of  anguish and pain and danger. And Jesus Christ says, that's what's happening to me as I'm going to  the cross. I'm like the woman who's giving birth to joy and a new life by going through all this  anguish.

And here's how you develop joy. You look and say, Lord Jesus, you lost all joy that I could  have eternal joy. You experience enormous anguish so I could have new life. And that's how the love  comes. Here's verse 5.

It says, this is the key to joy that sometimes the Holy Spirit pours the  love of God out on your heart. And you know how that happens? Here's how it happens. Don't say,  oh, okay, Lord, make me feel loved. I'm waiting.

That's abstract. That's not what happens. How does it  happen? You look at what Jesus has done. You look at him saying, I'm like the woman who lost her life  to bring new life.

I like the woman who lost all joy to bring you joy. You look at what he has  done for you. And that's what sometimes by the power of the Holy Spirit inflicts a joy on you  in a sense of how loved you are. That makes you able to handle anything in life no matter what the  circumstances are. That's it.

To the two things, the two ways the gospel gives you joy is it shows you  the magnitude of your danger was so great that all your other problems seem small by comparison to  the one problem which has been solved already. And number two, you see what Jesus has done for you. You see what he's given up. You see how he lost all joy to give you joy. And as you meditate on  that and as you pray over that day in and day out, sometimes the Holy Spirit gives you a sense of  God's love on your heart that it gives you the power to handle anything.

And that's how it works. Go get it. It's available. Let's pray. Thank you, Father, for giving us joy and giving us the  capacity for far greater joy than we have.

Lord, I pray that anyone here who has not really come on  to the inside of belief in the gospel has not really received it, has not really accepted it,  has not really come to know you by faith. It's not really experienced justification. I pray that  they would and that they would therefore begin to understand this joy. Joy in the face of the future,  joy in the face of suffering, joy before you. But I also pray, Lord, for all the rest of us who  already believe, but to great degree are relying on worldly circumstances for our happiness.

Give  us this joy, root us and ground us in joy. Give us an experience of your love so that we can  have the joy that Jesus had for the joy that was set before him. He endured the cross. And for the joy that you have given us we can do or anything because he endured that for us. It's in his name that we pray.

Amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

Today, Tim Keller is unpacking one of the fruit  of the Spirit, helping us see what it means to move from trying to be good to truly  changing from the inside out. The Scripture reading comes from Romans 5 verses 1 through 11. Therefore, since we have  been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through  whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we rejoice  in the hope of the glory of God, not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings because  we know that suffering produces perseverance, perseverance, character, and character hope. And hope does not disappoint us because God has poured out His love into our hearts by  the Holy Spirit whom He has given us.

You see, at just the right time, when we were still  powerless, Christ died for the ungodly. Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man,  though, for a good man, someone might possibly dare to die. But God demonstrates His own  love for us in this. All we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since we have now been  justified by His blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through Him?

Or if, when we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to Him through the death of His Son,  how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through His life? Not only is this  so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now  received reconciliation. This is God's Word. The premise of the Bible, well, there's a lot of premises, but the premise we're thinking  about today, tonight, one of the premises of the Bible is that there's a difference  between a morally restrained heart and a supernaturally changed heart. There's a difference  between using your willpower to suppress your self-centeredness and your fearfulness as  another thing, to have the Holy Spirit permanently change your heart, not through the power of  willpower, but through the power of the Spirit itself.

And Himself. However, what we're going  to be looking at over the next few weeks is a series of characteristics of a supernaturally  changed heart. How do you know whether you're just trying to be good or whether the Holy  Spirit's really brought transformation into your life? The way to do that is to look  at what's called the fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 5. Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness.

There's a whole set of traits or characteristics of a supernaturally changed heart, and each  week we're looking at one of them. And tonight, we're looking at joy. And this passage,  in Galatians 5, 1 to 11, tells us three things about joy. It tells us that joy is important. It tells us that joy is, secondly, Christian joy is unique, and then thirdly, it tells us  where Christian joy comes from.

It's important, Christian joy is unique, and where it comes  from. Number one, that joy is important. Verse 1 talks about justification by faith. Therefore, since we've been justified by faith, we have peace with God. And what Paul's  doing there is he's referring to everything he's been talking about in chapters 1 to 4.

And what does this justification by faith mean? Every other religion says, live as you  ought, and then God will bless and accept you. But only Christianity says, you receive  as acceptance and blessings of free gift through faith, because of Jesus' record, not your  record. And then you can and will live as you want. Total reversal, very revolutionary.

And to be a Christian is to someone who's now justified by faith. You have peace with  God. You're accepted by him because of what Jesus has done. And now what is the main  mark of a real Christian life? What's the main characteristic?

And according to chapter  5, 1 to 11, look, it says in verse 2b, it says, now we rejoice, joy in the hope of the  glory of God. And then in verse 3, not only this, we rejoice in our suffering. And then  down to verse 11, it says, and we rejoice in God. So John Stott, who's written a commentary  on the book of Romans, says, it seems clear from this paragraph that the main mark of  justified believers is joy. The major main mark, which means this text is saying that  to live a Christian life, in fact, to live life, you need a center of joy, an enormous  joy at your very center.

Now a lot of people don't believe that. A lot of people don't  believe that. A lot of people are afraid the pursuing joy is a dead end. For example, Amy  Bloom, over the last few years, by the way, there's been a lot of happiness studies, happiness  psychology. Have you seen those?

Lots of books trying to explore what makes us happy and  how we can be happy. And there's tons and tons of books on positive thinking and how  you can get control of your life so you can be happy. And by and large, the intelligentsia,  you know, the intellectuals and the writers and the pundits and the artists and the philosophers  hate all of that talk. Amy Bloom just a couple of months ago wrote this in the New York Times  essay. The name of the essay was The Wrap on Happiness.

And here's what she says. She says  the fashion, she says this, excuse me, quote, smart people talk trash about happiness and  worse than trash about books on happiness. And we have done so for centuries because happiness  studies and positive psychology, we don't see as being the work of the devil, but the work  of morons. And then she goes on to explain some of the reasons why. But here's the main one.

She says the real problem with happiness is not as pursuers or their books. It's happiness  itself. It's transience. It's deep but often brief. The world passes away from us.

The  petals fall and the beloved dies. And no amount of fashionable scowling will keep us from  savoring the pleasure of the sun on our faces or save us from our adult understanding that  it cannot last. Now what she's saying is this, if you really want serenity in life, don't  pursue happiness because anything you get joy from will not last. When no matter what  it is, it's going to disappoint you. So the only way to get serenity is not to try  to be happy.

Not to try to pursue joy. Now look, I understand this. When I was a 13-year-old  boy in the summer of 1964, okay, do the math. My team was the Philadelphia Phillies. And with  12 games to go, they were six games ahead of the second place St.

Louis Cardinals in the  National League. 12 games to go. Six games ahead. They're going to go to the World Series. And then they proceeded, some of you historians know, to lose 10 in a row. 10 games in a row. And they lost and they never went to the World Series.

Now when you're a 13-year-old boy  and that's your team, those 10 games, I lived through every pitch, every at bat, every out. I was dying a thousand deaths. I was experiencing an agony that no 13-year-old boy believed was possible. And when it was done, and my heart was literally broken, and you know what, okay, we're laughing,  but you know, it was awful. What I said was, never again.

I am never giving my heart to,  okay, fill in the blank because you see, all of us have something like that. Now,  you know, there are people who to this day are not past the emotional level of a 13-year-old boy  and it's still sports teams that are breaking their hearts. But for most of the rest of it,  it's what? I'm never going to, you know, it's a man or a woman or it's love or it's career,  it's success or something like that. And what happens is because our hearts want joy and our  hearts are like a big vacuum pump that has this enormous amount of sucking and it fixes itself  on something that this is going to make me happy.

And when it disappoints, then it will disappoint. See, it will not last. Then you say, okay, the only way I'm ever going to get serenity is to stop  pursuing joy and get what the philosopher is called detachment. In fact, that's what Buddhism is about. Buddhism is all about that.

And the old philosophers, the Greek philosophers, we're always about  detachment. Don't give your heart to anything. And that's the only way you'll be serene. Don't pursue  joy. Don't pursue happiness.

But there's a problem with that. Joseph Epstein, who's a brilliant scholar,  has taught English at Northwestern University for years, he was the editor of the American scholar  and he's just retired. But recently, he wrote an article in the Notre Dame magazine. And in it,  he recounts one of the great Greek philosophers, ancient Greek philosophers named Epicurus. And at one point, Epicurus got his disciples together in his garden and said, I can give you a  four step remedy for anxiety.

I can eliminate anxiety from your life. You can just be completely  serene if you just do these four things. He says, I can eliminate anxiety in the world if everybody  will do these four things. Would you like to know what they are? All right, well, okay.

Well, here's, and this is what Epstein says. He says, this is his summary of Epicurus' four steps. Step one, do not believe in God or in the gods. Okay, why? Okay, step two.

Therefore, now you don't  have to worry about death. Death, be assured, is oblivion. Nothing more than eternal dreamless sleep. See, there's no God or God. There's no heaven or hell.

You know, therefore, don't believe in God  or gods. Therefore, death is not nothing to be afraid of. Go and you die. It's like before you  were born, just an eternal dreamless sleep. Step three, don't be afraid of pain.

Why? Because pain  will either soon diminish and go away, or it will intensify in which case death is not far away  and as we've already seen, that's no problem. And now step four, do not attempt to acquire things  or money or fame or power. Why? Don't try, don't set your heart on anything.

Because if you,  because if you try for them, you may not attain them, which of course will mean you're very unhappy. But even if you do, he says, they never give you the value that is as great as what you spent trying  to obtain them. The game is not worth the candle. So there's the summary and Epstein summarizes  Epicurus' four steps for an anxiety-free life. He says, forget about God, forget about death,  forget about pain and forget about acquisition.

And then he says, the only way to find serenity,  according to the philosophers, is to stop seeking joy. Detach yourself from everything. Don't  attach your heart to anything. And here is what Epstein says. Conclusion, my guess is that this  program would work.

But even if it did work, would such utter detachment from life constitute a life  rich and complex enough to be worth living for? Many would say, yes, I am not among them. Now, actually, C. S. Lewis has said a little bit more eloquently.

He says, if you don't want your  heart to be broken, if you always want serenity, don't give your heart to anything. Don't give it to  the Philadelphia Phillies. Don't give it to anything. Don't give it to a man or woman, anything. Oh, he does mean you can't get married, but don't completely give your heart to anyone or anything.

Put it in a little casket. You see, to make sure that it never breaks, but in that casket,  it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, and irredeemable. And see, what Epstein is saying,  what C. S. Lewis is saying is, yes, on the one hand, if you give your heart to things, you're  going to be disappointed.

So if you seek joy, you're going to be disappointed. But on the other hand,  if you detach yourself and say, I'm not giving my heart to anything, that dehumanizes you. It hardens you. Well, is there any way forward now? The answer is yes.

Why? Because it's a sermon,  and that's only point one. Now there's point two. And point two is Christian joy is unique,  and Christian joy gets you out of the dilemma. How so?

There's two ways the Christian joy is unique. And the first one is that Christian joy is not based in circumstances at all. Look, what does it  say in verse three? It says, we rejoice in our sufferings. What?

Now what are sufferings? Sufferings,  suffering is favorable circumstances going away. Now here's the place where I think I'm going to  part ways with the word happiness, if you don't mind, because I actually don't believe that Christian  joy is what the world calls happiness. What the world calls happiness is, getting control of your  life so that you keep your circumstances favorable. Did you know that there is a happiness.com?

And at happiness.com, there is this, the surefire top five components for happiness. All right? Five things, if you get put these in place, you're happy. Number one, it says be in possession of  the basics. Food, shelter, good health, and in safety.

Number two, get enough sleep. All right. Sure, fine. Three, have relationships that matter to you, four, take compassionate care  of others and yourself, and five, have work that really interested engages you. Okay?

So get the  basics, food, shelter, good health. Do you realize how ridiculous that is? You say, what do you mean  ridiculous? Sure, you need all that to be happy. Sure, you need that to be happy.

Most people,  most places, most centuries have never had that. What are we going to do about all the people who  could never get enough food, shelter, good health, and safety today? They'll never will have it. You talk about engaging and interesting work. In other words, what this is saying, and this is  what the world believes, happiness is getting my circumstances in the right place.

I'm happy if  things are going well. Circumstances are favorable. But what about most of the people and most of  the times and most of the places that never have favorable circumstances like that? Are they doomed  to no happiness? Yes, they're doomed to no happiness as you and I define happiness in this culture  today.

A joy is available to them. And that Christian joy is not based on circumstances at all. In fact, look, when it says we rejoice in suffering, it doesn't mean, by the way, it's not saying  you rejoice for your suffering. You don't say, we, I'm suffering. Hey, that's great.

That's  masochism. Forget that way. It says we rejoice in our suffering. Well, how can you rejoice in  your suffering? Of all your circumstances are going bad.

Verse 11, you rejoice in God. And he's not susceptible. He's not subject to circumstances. But here's what's really  interesting about verse 3 and 4. It says, you rejoice in suffering with why?

Because suffering  produces stronger endurance. Perseverance means character and perseverance and encourage. And that leads to more hope. And that hope is in the future glory of God, which makes us rejoice  the verse 2 B says we rejoice in the future glory of God. We'll get there in a minute.

Verse 3 says  suffering can actually give you more of that hope and therefore more of that joy. And what this is  saying is, Christian joy, unlike worldly happiness, not only can be maintained when all circumstances  go unfavorable, but it can also grow. In fact, it does usually grow. You say, how can that be? Christian joy can grow when things are bad.

The worldly happiness goes away when things are bad. Why? Because it's based in good circumstances. But Christian joy can actually get stronger. How?

Well, don't you remember how your mother used to always say? Don't eat that candy before meals. You know, if she would ever want it anytime within about 30 minutes before you're about to eat,  you know, a meal, your mother would be all over if you're eating potato chips or candy or anything  sweet or anything like that. Why? She says, it'll ruin your appetite.

And mothers aren't always  right. Mothers are never in, you know, often wrong, but never in doubt. However, they are right about  this. And that is the trouble with eating candy is it gives you a sugar buzz and you don't feel hungry,  but it masks the fact that your body needs proteins and it needs all kinds of stuff that you don't have. Candy gives you a sugar buzz that masks the fact that your body needs nutrients that you're  not giving it and sex and money and power and success.

Favorable circumstances are spiritual sugar. And what happens to Christians is you say, oh, I believe in God and I know I'm going to heaven  whatever, but you actually base your day-to-day joy and happiness on circumstances and when the  circumstances go away, it drives you into God because when the sugar goes away, when the candy  goes away, you're forced to go after the feast that your soul really needs to get the nutrients  your soul really needs. What happens when things go bad is it drives you into God and you develop  a poise, you develop a power, you develop a strong kind of joy that never goes away regardless  of circumstances. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God. Even Jesus relied on the  Psalms to face every situation, including death.

In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365-day devotional,  the songs of Jesus, you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start and if you  already spend time and study in prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you  bring your deepest emotions and questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with him. We'll send you Tim and Kathy Keller's devotional as our thanks for your gift to help Gospel  and Life share the love of Jesus with more people. Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com-slash-give  that's gospelandlife.com-slash-give. So first of all, Christian joy is unique because it's not based on circumstances.

It's not grounded in circumstances, but secondly, Christian joy is unique  because it's already but not yet. It's already but not yet. Look, on the one hand,  verse 2b says, we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God. Now what's that mean? It means when  you become a Christian because your salvation is not based in your good works and your efforts.

There's a certainty you've got about your future. See, remember what we said about all the religions,  all of the religions say, if you live as you want, then God will bless you, which means in every  if you believe the reason God blesses me, the reason I believe I have a relationship with God is  because I've lived a good life and I'm living a good life and I'm praying and I'm doing all these  things. That means you have no certainty about your future, spiritually speaking because what if  you give up or what if you don't keep it up? You can't be sure because you haven't gotten  into your life yet and you might fail or you might do something. So religion in which your salvation  essentially is earned by you creates an uncertainty about your future.

But Christianity says there's  now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus and it's absolutely certain that someday  you will share in the hope of the glory of God that you'll live in the world before him and this  world is going to be completely renewed and when you get there, the moment you get there, you're  going to stamp your foot and you're going to say, I've come home at last. This is my real country. I belong here. This is the land I've been looking for all my life and I never knew it till now. And the knowledge of that, the knowledge of that, it's not yet but it's there, it's coming.

The word  hope in the Bible does not mean hope so, it's not an uncertainty. Hope in the Bible is life-shaping  certainty of something that you're going to have but you don't have it yet. But even the  stories about it and the thoughts about it and the biblical texts about it and our understanding  of that future is grounding. See, it's poised creating. When other circumstances are going away,  becoming unfavorable, we know about the hope of the glory of God.

That's not yet but is that all we have? We just know what's going to happen. We just think about it. So when we're suffering,  we just say, I know in the future it's going to be better. Is that it?

No, that's not all we have  because look carefully. Verse 4 and 5. It says, suffering produces perseverance and perseverance  character and character hope and our hope does not disappoint us why because God has poured out his  love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit who he has given us. What does that word pour out mean? Does that mean the Holy Spirit just tells us that God loves us?

Does that mean that we know that God  loves us? We already know God loves us. What is this talking about? The poor out metaphor  is a way of expressing experience. And this is saying that sometimes that feast that we know we're  going to have in the future, we get an order of now.

Sometimes that glory that we're going to have  in the future, sometimes you experience it now. And this is at the very heart of the Christian joy  that's available to you through Christ, through the faith of Christ, through the Holy Spirit. It's a foretaste of that glory. Some of the old people, I mean some of the old British  pastors like Richard Sibs and William Guthrie write about it like this. Listen, this is 17th  century English but so work with it.

Here he says, Richard Sibs says, sometimes our spirits cannot  stand in trials. So the immediate testimony of the Spirit comes to us saying, I am thy salvation  and our hearts are stirred up and comforted with joy inexpressible. This joy has degrees. Sometimes it's so clear and strong that we question nothing and other times doubts come in soon. William Guthrie says, it's not an audible voice.

We don't hear an audible voice. Rather, what we're talking about here is a ray of glory filling the soul. It's like the word of Jesus to Mary. The Lord only said her name in the garden, Mary. And it filled her soul so she no longer doubted she was his.

How glorious is this manifestation of the  Spirit. You will not have the Christian joy that roots and grounds you no matter what the circumstances. You will tend to simply rely on worldly happiness which is based on favorable circumstances which  of course is so fragile. You will not have the Christian joy unless sometimes you have experiences  of the love of God direct to your heart through prayer. It's the foretaste of that.

It's the  already foretaste of the not yet. And you heard what Richard said. It doesn't happen a lot. It doesn't happen constantly. Sometimes it's very high.

Sometimes it's kind of low and it goes  away fast. But you know it. When you have those experiences, I know it's weird to have a  Presbyterian minister saying this. When you have those experiences that goes along with your knowledge  because I know I'm saved by grace, I know that the glory of God is my destiny. And yet at the same  time I've got a subject that is well as an objective nature.

It might not only have my mind. I've got  my heart. And the Bible says Christian joy gives you what you need both head and heart. And do you not see now? How this in a sense answers the dilemma we talked about in the first point.

Because the first point dilemma is this. Things in this world are great. And yet if we give our heart  to them, then we get disappointed. So then we detach. And then we don't rejoice in things.

C.S. Lewis's autobiography is called Surprise by Joy. And it's all about the fact that before he  was a Christian, he was always trying to find joy in other things. And whenever he found something  he thought would give him joy, he binged on it. So for example, the first time he read an Icelandic  saga.

He loved it. And he started to say, oh I want to get that feeling back. I have when I read it. It  was so exciting. So what he did to do, he reads every Icelandic saga.

And then he goes and learns  old Norse so he can read it in the original. And yet as he works through it, he comes to realize  well somehow the joy I thought was going to give me never comes through. And then suddenly he gets  a friend. And you know sometimes there's nothing more wonderful than a great evening talking with  a friend. And you come back feeling so good.

And when he first made it, he would get a friend and  he would binge on the friend. Every night, let's get together. Let's talk. After a while the friend  saying, whoa, maybe not tonight. Or maybe not for a while.

He would binge. And at one point,  he becomes, he starts to realize that there's a god behind the joy. And as he was getting converted  as he was sort of moving toward becoming a Christian, he says this at one point. He says the book,  I came to realize that the books are the music in which I thought the beauty and the joy was located  betrayed me if I trusted in them. The joy was not in them.

It only came through them. These things, these things, the joy, the beauty, if they're mistaken for the thing itself,  the things that give it through which it comes. If they're mistaken for the thing itself,  they turn into dumb idols breaking the hearts of their worshipers. For they are not the joy itself,  these things that bring it. They are only the scent of a flower we haven't found yet.

The echo of a tune we have not heard yet. The news from a country we haven't visited yet. And at the very end, the last chapter, the last page of his autobiographies,  become a Christian. And here's what he says. It's very, very interesting.

He says, for many years,  he thought the joy is here, the joy is here. And he would go to that landscape or that set of  friends or that book or that writing or whatever. And then he came to realize it was from God. And the joy was coming through the things. And then he ends with this fascinating illustration.

I want to tell what I would give you because I think it actually answers the problem. He says, if you are lost in the woods, and you first come upon a signpost, it's a big deal. The one who first sees the signpost in the woods says, look, and the whole party gathers  around and stares and says, ah, finally, that's the direction. But if you found the road,  and if you're passing signposts every few miles, you don't stop and stare at the signposts. They encourage you.

And you will be grateful to the authority that set them up. But we will not stop and stare at the signposts or at least not too much,  though their pillars are of silver and their lettering is of gold. Why? Because we would rather be in  Jerusalem. See his point.

He says, if you really are lost when you find a signpost, you get  pretty excited about it. But when you know your way, when you know the thing to which the signpost  point, that's where you're on your way. And you don't stop and look at the signposts. And what  do you realize is food, friends, success, acclaim, popularity, money, all the things that we think,  if I have that, that's going to give me the joy, our signposts. So enjoy them.

Some of them are great. There are some of them are made of silver with letters of gold. But don't mistake the signposts  for what they're signing, the thing they're pointing to, which is the city of God, which is God  himself. And that gets you out of either being afraid of enjoying things in this life or at the  same time resting your heart too much in them. And let's final question.

How do you really get  this joy? Because I've been all long saying Christian joy is like this and Christian joy is  like that. Well, how do you get Christian joy? You say, well, I guess become a Christian. Well,  let's be a little more specific because I know an awful lot of Christians that don't have much of  the joy.

And here's what I'd like you to see. The last part of the passage, the last part,  is, you know, worth five or six sermons. And by the way, there's plenty of people who preach five  or six sermons on these, you know, verses. However, the essence of them is the gospel. And in  verses eight and nine, there's a beautiful little summary of what the gospel is while we were still  sinners Christ died for us.

That we might be saved from God's wrath. Now God's wrath  is it's not just crankiness. God's wrath is his judicial opposition to evil. His settled judicial  opposition to injustice and evil. And the human race deserves punishment because we have  participated in evil and injustice.

But Jesus Christ, while we were still sinners, that's grace. Not because we cleaned up our life. While we're still sinners, Jesus Christ took the wrath. He took  the condemnation. He took the punishment.

And that's the gospel. How does that bring joy? Two ways. And these are very important in their practical number one, the gospel shows you the magnitude of your  danger. Now this is counterintuitive because from the outside, the gospel, the first part of the  gospel, which is you're a sinner, you're lost, you deserve punishment, you deserve wrath.

That sounds  negative. Gee, why would you consider that negative? Well, of course it sounds negative. But you  know what that means on the inside. On the inside, we realize the size of the debt and the magnitude of  the danger we were in, which we weren't aware of before.

One preacher put it like this. He says,  imagine that you went away and a friend of yours was staying in your home. And when you came back,  your friend said, you know what? A bill came for you. And I opened it.

I hope you don't mind. And I saw what the bill was. And I paid it for you. I paid it out of my own money. And the  preacher says, okay, now, how should you respond?

And the answer is, you have no idea how to respond. You know why you don't know why you're out of respond? Because you don't know the size of the debt. You don't know how big the bill was. Was it postage due on this package?

Then you would have said,  oh, thank you. That was very kind of you. But what if the IRS finally found where you lived? And that was the bill for back taxes that you know you have no resources of your own  to fulfill that bill. And that was paid for.

In other words, the preacher says,  until you know the size of the bill and the size of the debt, you don't know whether you to say,  hi, thank you very much, were to fall at his feet as dead saying, you saved me. You don't know how  grateful to be. You don't know how joyful to be until you know how bad you bad off it was, right? And JC Ryle, the old Bishop of Liverpool says, one of the reasons why you get so upset  over the debts, your financial debts, your financial problems is you don't realize that the great  debt, the only debt that debt of sin, the only debt that could really sink you has been paid. And when you see that, then all other debts, no matter how great they seem to be, you are little.

You follow that. See, from the outside, the idea that you're more wicked than you ever did believe  and you deserve wrath, you deserve to be punished. That sounds like bad news from the inside. Once you believe in the gospel and you see that all those years, the sort of damnacles was over  your head and you never knew was about to fall. When you see the magnitude of the debt, the magnitude of  your danger and you realize what you were delivered from, it inflicts a joy on you that never goes away.

That is, if that sounds odd to you, it's because you're not deeply on the inside. You really  haven't come on the inside. You haven't really accepted that. If you accept the bad news of the  gospel that you're a sinner needing salvation from the inside, it creates a joy that says,  you know what? Okay, I've got debts.

I've got diseases, but the only debt that can really  sink me has been paid and the only disease that can really kill me eternally has been healed. And even cancer can't do that. It can't really sink me because if I belong to him, I've got the  hope of the glory of God. The real disease has been healed. The real debt has been cancelled.

And so the first thing that the gospel does is it shows you the magnitude  of your danger, but the second thing it shows you is the magnitude of Jesus' pain. There's a weird place, and I do consider it weird, in John chapter 16, where Jesus is trying to comfort  his disciples the night before he's about to die. And he's trying to say, look, look, you know,  this is going to be hard on you. But then he says, a woman giving birth to a child has pain because  her time has come. But when the baby is born, joy for a child is born into the world.

And so it is  with you. What is he saying? And I looked it up because every time I look at that passage,  I always look at the commentators to make sure I'm not imagining all the commentators agree. Jesus Christ is identifying with a woman. And here's what you have to remember.

Nowadays, most  women have babies have some pain, but there are these things called epidurals and things like that. But in those days, not only did women never give birth except through excruciating pain,  but women constantly died in childbirth all the time. And what that meant was the only way for a woman  to give birth to a new baby and the joy of a new life was for her to go into a tunnel of  anguish and pain and danger. And Jesus Christ says, that's what's happening to me as I'm going to  the cross. I'm like the woman who's giving birth to joy and a new life by going through all this  anguish.

And here's how you develop joy. You look and say, Lord Jesus, you lost all joy that I could  have eternal joy. You experience enormous anguish so I could have new life. And that's how the love  comes. Here's verse 5.

It says, this is the key to joy that sometimes the Holy Spirit pours the  love of God out on your heart. And you know how that happens? Here's how it happens. Don't say,  oh, okay, Lord, make me feel loved. I'm waiting.

That's abstract. That's not what happens. How does it  happen? You look at what Jesus has done. You look at him saying, I'm like the woman who lost her life  to bring new life.

I like the woman who lost all joy to bring you joy. You look at what he has  done for you. And that's what sometimes by the power of the Holy Spirit inflicts a joy on you  in a sense of how loved you are. That makes you able to handle anything in life no matter what the  circumstances are. That's it.

To the two things, the two ways the gospel gives you joy is it shows you  the magnitude of your danger was so great that all your other problems seem small by comparison to  the one problem which has been solved already. And number two, you see what Jesus has done for you. You see what he's given up. You see how he lost all joy to give you joy. And as you meditate on  that and as you pray over that day in and day out, sometimes the Holy Spirit gives you a sense of  God's love on your heart that it gives you the power to handle anything.

And that's how it works. Go get it. It's available. Let's pray. Thank you, Father, for giving us joy and giving us the  capacity for far greater joy than we have.

Lord, I pray that anyone here who has not really come on  to the inside of belief in the gospel has not really received it, has not really accepted it,  has not really come to know you by faith. It's not really experienced justification. I pray that  they would and that they would therefore begin to understand this joy. Joy in the face of the future,  joy in the face of suffering, joy before you. But I also pray, Lord, for all the rest of us who  already believe, but to great degree are relying on worldly circumstances for our happiness.

Give  us this joy, root us and ground us in joy. Give us an experience of your love so that we can  have the joy that Jesus had for the joy that was set before him. He endured the cross. And for the joy that you have given us we can do or anything because he endured that for us. It's in his name that we pray.

Amen.

### 引言：道德约束的心与超自然改变的心的区别

圣经说，意志力驱动的心与超自然改变的心之间有天壤之别。今天，Tim Keller 正在解读圣灵的果子之一，帮助我们看到从努力做好事到真正从内心改变的意义。

经文来自罗马书 5 章 1 到 11 节。因此，我们既因信称义，就借着我们的主耶稣基督与神相和。我们又借着他，因信得进入现在所站的这恩典中，并且欢欢喜喜盼望神的荣耀。不但如此，就是在患难中也是欢欢喜喜的。因为知道患难生忍耐，忍耐生老练，老练生盼望。盼望不至于羞耻，因为所赐给我们的圣灵将神的爱浇灌在我们心里。因我们还软弱的时候，基督就按所定的日期为罪人死。为义人死，是少有的，为仁人死，或者有敢作的。惟有基督在我们还作罪人的时候为我们死，神的爱就在此向我们显明了。现在我们既靠着他的血称义，就更要借着他免去神的忿怒。因为我们作仇敌的时候，且借着神儿子的死得与神和好，既已和好，就更要因他的生得救了。不但如此，我们既借着我主耶稣基督得与神和好，也就借着他以神为乐。这是神的话。

圣经的前提，嗯，有很多前提，但我们今天晚上要思考的前提之一是，道德约束的心与超自然改变的心之间的区别。使用意志力来压抑自我中心和恐惧是一回事，而让圣灵永久改变你的心，不是通过意志力的力量，而是通过圣灵本身的力量，是另一回事。

### 第一部分：喜乐的重要性

#### 1. 称义信徒的标志

在接下来的几周里，我们将研究超自然改变的心的一系列特征。你如何知道你只是努力做好事，还是圣灵真的在你的生命中带来了转变？方法是查看加拉太书 5 章中所谓的圣灵的果子。爱、喜乐、和平、忍耐、恩慈。有一整套超自然改变的心的特征或特性，每周我们都会研究其中之一。今晚，我们要看的是喜乐。加拉太书 5 章 1 到 11 节告诉我们关于喜乐的三件事。它告诉我们喜乐很重要。其次，它告诉我们基督徒的喜乐是独特的，然后第三，它告诉我们基督徒的喜乐来自哪里。它很重要，基督徒的喜乐是独特的，以及它来自哪里。

**第一，喜乐很重要。** 第 1 节谈到因信称义。因此，既因信称义，就与神相和。保罗在这里所做的是指他在第 1 到 4 章中所谈论的一切。因信称义是什么意思？其他所有宗教都说，按你应当的方式生活，然后神会祝福和接纳你。但只有基督教说，你通过信心接受作为免费礼物的接纳和祝福，因为耶稣的记录，而不是你的记录。然后你可以并且将按你想要的方式生活。完全的颠覆，非常革命性。

> "称义信徒的主要标志是喜乐。"

约翰·斯托特在他所写的罗马书注释中说，很明显，从这一段中可以看出，称义信徒的主要标志是喜乐。主要的标志，这意味着这段经文在说，要过基督徒的生活，实际上，要过生活，你需要一个喜乐的中心，一个在你内心深处的巨大喜乐。

### 第二部分：基督徒喜乐的独特性

#### 1. 喜乐不基于环境

基督徒的喜乐是独特的，基督徒的喜乐让你摆脱困境。怎么会这样？基督徒的喜乐有两个独特之处。第一个是基督徒的喜乐根本不基于环境。看，第 3 节说什么？它说，我们在患难中也是欢欢喜喜的。什么？那么什么是患难？患难是不利环境的消失。

**基督徒的喜乐可以在逆境中增长。**

#### 2. 已经但尚未

基督徒的喜乐是独特的，因为它是已经但尚未。看，一方面，第 2 节 b 说，我们欢欢喜喜盼望神的荣耀。这是什么意思？这意味着当你成为基督徒时，因为你的救恩不是基于你的善行和努力。你对未来有一种确定性。

### 第三部分：如何获得基督徒的喜乐

#### 1. 理解福音

你如何真正获得这种喜乐？因为我一直在说基督徒的喜乐是这样的，基督徒的喜乐是那样的。那么，你如何获得基督徒的喜乐？你说，好吧，我想成为基督徒。好吧，让我们更具体一点，因为我知道很多基督徒并没有太多的喜乐。

**福音显示了你危险的严重性。**

#### 2. 默想耶稣的牺牲

你看着说，主耶稣，你失去了一切喜乐，以便我可以拥有永恒的喜乐。你经历了巨大的痛苦，以便我可以拥有新的生命。这就是爱的来临。

让我们祷告。感谢天父赐给我们喜乐，并赐给我们远超我们所拥有的更大的喜乐的能力。主，我祈求这里的任何人，如果他们还没有真正进入福音的信仰内部，还没有真正接受它，还没有真正接受它，还没有通过信心真正认识你，还没有真正经历称义。我祈求他们会这样做，因此开始理解这种喜乐。面对未来的喜乐，面对苦难的喜乐，在你面前的喜乐。但我也祈求，主，为我们所有已经相信的人，但在很大程度上依赖于世俗环境来获得快乐的人。赐给我们这种喜乐，使我们在喜乐中扎根并立足。赐给我们你的爱的体验，以便我们可以拥有耶稣所拥有的喜乐，因为他为了摆在面前的喜乐忍受了十字架。因为你赐给我们的喜乐，我们可以忍受任何事情，因为他为我们忍受了这一切。我们奉他的名祷告。阿门。

## Chinese Transcript / 中文

今天，提姆·凯勒正在讲解圣灵的一个果子，帮助我们看见，从“努力做好人”到“里面真实被改变”到底意味着什么。经文来自罗马书 5:1-11：

“所以，我们既因信称义，就借着我们的主耶稣基督得与神相和。我们又借着他，因信得进现在所站的这恩典中，并且欢欢喜喜盼望神的荣耀。不但如此，就是在患难中也是欢欢喜喜的。因为知道患难生忍耐，忍耐生老练，老练生盼望；盼望不至于羞耻，因为所赐给我们的圣灵，将神的爱浇灌在我们心里。

因我们还软弱的时候，基督就按锁定的日期为罪人死。为义人死，是少有的；为仁人死，或者有敢作的。惟有基督在我们还作罪人的时候为我们死，神的爱就在此向我们显明了。现在我们既靠着他的血称义，就更要借着他免去神的忿怒。

因为我们作仇敌的时候，且借着神儿子的死得与神和好；既已和好，就更要因他的生得救了。不但如此，我们既借着我们主耶稣基督得与神和好，也就借着他以神为乐。”

这是神的话。

圣经有很多根本性的前提，但今天、今晚我们要思想的其中一个是：在“道德上被约束的心”与“被超自然改变的心”之间，是有区别的。用意志力压制自己的自我中心、恐惧等等，和让圣灵永久性地改变你的心，这两者完全不同；前者靠的是人的意志力，后者靠的是圣灵本身的大能。

接下来几周，我们会看一系列“被超自然改变的心”的特征。怎么知道你只是“在努力当个好人”，还是圣灵真的把改变带进了你的生命？方法就是看加拉太书 5 章里所谓的“圣灵的果子”：仁爱、喜乐、和平、忍耐、恩慈……这是一整组“被超自然改变的心”的特质，每一周我们看其中一个。今晚，我们看的是“喜乐”。

这段罗马书 5:1-11 告诉我们关于喜乐的三件事：第一，喜乐是重要的；第二，基督徒的喜乐是独特的；第三，基督徒的喜乐从哪里来。

重要性、独特性，以及来源。

第一，喜乐的重要性。第 1 节谈到因信称义：“所以，我们既因信称义，就借着我们的主耶稣基督得与神相和。”保罗在这里是把前面 1–4 章所讲的统统收束起来。那“因信称义”是什么意思？

所有其他宗教都说：你先按着应当的方式去活，然后神才会赐福、接纳你。但只有基督教说：你是先白白领受接纳和祝福，这完全是恩典、借着信心临到你，依据的是耶稣的记录，而不是你的记录；然后你才可以、也一定会按你“应当成为的样子”去活。这是一个完全反转、极具革命性的观念。

所以，一个基督徒，就是那位“因信称义”的人：你与神和好，你被神接纳是因为耶稣所做的。而现在，一个真正的基督徒生命的主要记号是什么？最核心的特征是什么？

根据罗马书 5:1-11，请看：在第 2 节后半他说：“并且欢欢喜喜盼望神的荣耀”；第 3 节说：“不但如此，就是在患难中也是欢欢喜喜的”；到了第 11 节：“不但如此，我们既借着我们主耶稣基督得与神和好，也就借着他以神为乐。”

约翰·斯托得在他对《罗马书》的注释中说：从这一段经文看来，“被称义之人的主要记号就是喜乐”。“主要记号”，意思是这段经文在说：要活出一个基督徒的生命——实际上，要活出一个生命——你需要在生命最中心有一个巨大的喜乐，一个强而有力的喜乐核心。

但很多人不相信这一点。很多人并不认为追求喜乐是正路。比如艾米·布鲁姆（Amy Bloom），过去几年你可能注意到，关于“幸福”的研究、关于快乐心理学的书多得不得了。你看到过吗？一大堆书在探讨：是什么让我们快乐，我们如何可以快乐。有大量关于“积极思考”的书，教你怎样掌控人生，好让你快乐。

然而，整体而言，知识分子——也就是所谓的“精英”：知识界、作家、评论员、艺术家和哲学家——都非常厌恶这一整套关于幸福的谈论。艾米·布鲁姆几个月前在《纽约时报》写了一篇文章，题目叫《幸福的坏名声》（The Wrap on Happiness）。她在里面说：

“聪明人会轻蔑地谈论幸福，也更轻蔑地谈那些有关幸福的书。我们这样做已经好几个世纪了，因为我们并不认为幸福研究和积极心理学是出于魔鬼的工作，而是出于笨蛋的工作。”

然后她继续解释原因，核心理由是：真正的问题不在于那些追求幸福的人或他们的书，而在于“幸福”本身——因为它是短暂的。她说：

“幸福是短暂的，是深刻却常常短促。世界从我们身边流逝，花瓣凋落，所爱的人终究死去。无论我们摆出多少时髦的冷笑，都不能阻止我们享受阳光照在脸上的片刻愉悦，也不能救我们脱离那成熟的理解：这些都不会长久。”

她在说什么？她在说：如果你真正想要生命中有“安稳”，那就不要追求幸福，因为凡是让你得喜乐的东西，都不会长久——不论是什么，最终都会让你失望。所以唯一能得到“安稳”的方式，是不去追求喜乐、不去追求幸福。

我能理解这一点。1964 年夏天，当我 13 岁的时候（你可以算一算），我的球队是费城费城人队（Philadelphia Phillies）。常规赛还剩 12 场比赛的时候，他们领先第二名圣路易红雀队（St. Louis Cardinals）整整 6 场。12 场球，领先 6 场——他们几乎稳进世界大赛了。

结果接下来发生什么？有些历史迷知道：他们连输 10 场，10 场全败，然后被反超，无缘世界大赛。对一个 13 岁的男孩来说，在那 10 场球中，我几乎经历了每一球、每一打席、每一个出局，我仿佛死了一千次。我经历了一个 13 岁少年从未想到过的痛苦。当一切结束的时候，我的心是真的“碎了”。

我们现在可以笑，但当时真的很糟。我当时心里说的是：再也不要这样了。我再也不会把我的心交给——你可以自己填空。我们每个人生命中都有类似的东西。有些人到现在，在情感层面上还停留在一个 13 岁男孩的阶段，他们的心仍然被某个体育队伍一次次摔碎。但对大多数人来说，那个“再也不要”的对象已经变成了别的——男或女、爱情、事业、成功……

发生了什么？我们的心渴望喜乐，我们的心就像一个巨大的真空泵，里面有强大的“吸力”，它会吸附在某些东西上，说：“这就是让我快乐的东西。”而当那东西让你失望——它总会让你失望，因为它不会长久——你就会说：“好，我一生能够得到安稳的唯一方式，就是停止追求喜乐，获得哲学家所说的‘冷漠’（detachment）。”

事实上，这正是佛教强调的道路；古希腊的哲学家也是这样说的：不要把你的心交给任何东西，这样你才能平静，不要追求喜乐，不要追求幸福。

但这里有一个问题。约瑟夫·爱普斯坦（Joseph Epstein）是一个很优秀的学者，在西北大学教英文多年，也做过《American Scholar》杂志的主编。最近他在《圣母大学杂志》上写了一篇文章，其中提到古希腊哲学家伊壁鸠鲁（Epicurus）。

有一次，伊壁鸠鲁把门徒聚集在花园里，对他们说：“我可以给你们一个四步处方，让你们得着完全没有焦虑的生命。如果所有人都实践这四件事，我可以除去世界上的焦虑。你们想知道是哪四件事吗？”

爱普斯坦这样总结伊壁鸠鲁的“四步走”：第一，不要相信神或众神。为什么？（先听完。）第二，因此，你也不必再害怕死亡。死亡，只不过是永恒、无梦的睡眠——就像你出生以前那样；既然没有神，也没有天堂和地狱，你死了就结束了。第三，不要害怕痛苦。为什么？因为痛苦要么很快减轻并离开，要么会加剧，以至于死亡就近了，而我们已经说过，死亡没什么可怕的。第四，不要追求财物、金钱、名声或权势。为什么？因为你若追求，可能得不到，就会非常痛苦；即便得到，所付出的代价往往大于所得的价值。

爱普斯坦说：这就是伊壁鸠鲁除去人生焦虑的四步：忘掉神，忘掉死亡，忘掉痛苦，忘掉获得。哲学家的结论是：不要再追求喜乐，要把自己从一切东西上抽离出来，不要把心附着在任何东西上。

然后他下了一个结论：

“我猜想，这套方案也许确实有效。但即便有效，一个人彻底从生命中抽离，不再紧密地参与，这样的生命，会丰富、复杂到值得去过吗？很多人会说‘会’，我不在其列。”

其实，C.S. 路易斯讲得更优雅。他说：如果你不想自己的心被打碎，如果你一生都想保持安稳，那就不要把心交给任何东西——不要把心交给费城人队，也不要把心交给任何事物；不要把心完全交给任何男人或女人。把你的心放在一个小匣子里，好让它永远不会破碎。但在那匣子里，它会变得不能破、不能透、不能救赎。

爱普斯坦和路易斯在说的是：如果你把心给了某个东西，你就会被它失望；所以如果你追求喜乐，你就会被伤。但如果你把自己抽离，说“我不会再把心交给任何东西”，你就会被去人性化，你的心会硬掉。

那还有路吗？答案是：有。为什么？因为这是篇讲道，现在才讲完第一点，接下来还有第二点。第二点是：基督徒的喜乐是独特的，它能带你走出这个两难。

基督徒的喜乐之所以独特，至少有两个方面。第一，基督徒的喜乐不是建立在环境之上的。看第 3 节：“不但如此，就是在患难中也是欢欢喜喜的。”你会说，什么？“患难”是什么？患难就是那些有利的环境被拿走的状态。

在这里，我要和“幸福”这个词稍微保持一点距离。因为我不认为，基督徒的喜乐等同于世界所说的“幸福”。世界的“幸福”基本是：设法掌控你的生命，使环境一直保持有利。

你知道有个网站叫 happiness.com 吗？上面列了“幸福的五个万无一失组成要素”：第一，要拥有基本需要：食物、住所、健康和安全；第二，要有足够的睡眠；第三，要有对你重要的人际关系；第四，要以怜悯的方式照顾他人和自己；第五，要有令你真正感兴趣且投入的工作。

换句话说，把这些基本“条件”都安排到位，你就幸福。听上去挺合理：当然，你需要这些东西才会幸福。但你注意到这其实很荒谬吗？绝大部分人在绝大部分地方、绝大部分世纪里，从来没有拥有过这种条件——充足的食物、住房、良好的健康和安全，更不要说“有趣的工作”了。

如果我们把“幸福”定义成这些条件的总和，那绝大多数人就注定永远得不到“幸福”。是的，如果你按我们当代文化的定义来看，他们就被判定永远不会幸福。

但有一种喜乐却是他们可以得着的，这就是基督徒的喜乐，它不是建立在环境之上的。事实上，当保罗说“在患难中也欢欢喜喜”的时候，他不是叫你为患难本身欢喜——不是说：“哇，我在受苦，太棒了！”那是受虐狂。这里说的是“在患难中”仍能喜乐。

那怎么可能？如果所有环境都糟糕透顶，你还能喜乐？第 11 节说：我们以神为乐。神自己并不受环境起落的影响。

更有意思的是第 3–4 节：“患难生忍耐，忍耐生老练，老练生盼望。”这盼望就是前面 2 节所说“神荣耀的盼望”。也就是说，患难反而可以给你更多这样的盼望，因此带来更多的喜乐。

也就是说，基督徒的喜乐，不但可以在环境极其糟糕的时候被保守，反而会在这样的环境里增长——事实上，通常是在困苦中被炼成。那你会问：怎么可能？基督徒的喜乐在恶劣环境里会长，而世人的幸福在恶劣环境里就消失。原因就在于：世人的幸福立足在“顺利环境”上，而基督徒的喜乐却不是。

你还记得你母亲小时候说的话吗？“吃饭前不要吃糖。”任何时候，只要你离吃饭还有半小时，你要吃糖、吃薯片，母亲就会立刻制止你。为什么？她说：“会影响你吃饭。”

母亲不见得总是对的，她可能常常错、却从不怀疑自己。但在这一点上，她是对的。糖带来的问题是，它给你一个“糖分冲击”，让你感觉不饿，却掩盖了身体对真正营养——蛋白质等——的需要。糖让你有一种“满足感”的错觉，却没给你身体所需的养分。

性、金钱、权力、成功这些“有利的环境”，在属灵层面上就是糖。对很多基督徒来说，他会说：“哦，我当然相信神，也相信我会去天堂。”但在日常生活中，他仍然把自己的快乐、满足系在这些环境上。当环境被拿走时，他被迫要向神奔去。

当“糖”被拿走，你才被迫去吃那真正的盛宴——让你的灵魂得着它真正需要的养分。当事情变糟时，它把你推向神，使你获得一种定力、一种能力、一种坚韧的喜乐，这喜乐不再取决于环境。诗篇就可以深刻地塑造你亲近神的方式。

甚至连耶稣也依靠诗篇来面对各种境况，包括死亡。在提姆和凯西·凯勒的 365 天灵修书《耶稣的诗歌》（The Songs of Jesus）里，你会看到每天通过诗篇的读经与默想。如果你还没有固定的灵修习惯，这本书是一个非常好的起点；如果你已经有固定的读经祷告，那么透过诗篇，你可以把心中最深的情感和问题带到神面前，经历与他的更新亲密。

我们会把这本灵修书送给所有愿意支持“福音与生命”（Gospel in Life）事工的人，作为感谢。你可以在 gospelandlife.com/slash-give 上索取。

所以，首先，基督徒的喜乐是独特的，因为它不扎根在环境上；其次，基督徒的喜乐是“已经却尚未”的。

一方面，第 2 节后半说：“并且欢欢喜喜盼望神的荣耀。”这意味着，当你成为基督徒，因为你的救恩不是建立在你的善行和努力上，你对自己的未来就有了一种确定性。记住我们刚才说的：其他宗教都说，“如果你照着该有的样子去活，神就会祝福你、接纳你”；换句话说，如果你相信自己之所以蒙福、之所以与神有关系，是因为你过得够好、做得够多，那你对自己的未来就永远无法确定，因为你还没走到生命终点，你可能会失败、会放弃。

但基督教却说：“如今，那些在基督耶稣里的就不被定罪了。”这意味着你如今就可以确定：有一天你会分享神的荣耀——你会在一个被完全更新的世界里与神一同居住。你一踏进那个世界，你会跺跺脚说：“我终于到家了！这才是我的真正故乡。我本来就属于这里，这是我一生在寻找、却从未真正认识的那块土地。”

对这未来荣耀的认识——还没实现、却必然实现——是扎根性的，是在其他一切环境都崩塌时给你带来定力的东西。

圣经里“盼望”这个词，绝不是“希望如此、但不确定”；而是一种对将来必得之物的“生命塑造性的确定”。你还没拿到，却知道一定会拿到。而关于那个未来世界的故事、经文、想象和理解，都会给你如今的生命带来稳定与平衡。

但我们拥有的只是“知道未来会更好”吗？在患难中，我们只是对自己说：“好吧，将来会更好”？就这样吗？不止于此。请留意第 4–5 节：“患难生忍耐，忍耐生老练，老练生盼望；盼望不至于羞耻，因为……神的爱藉着所赐给我们的圣灵浇灌在我们心里。”

“浇灌”是什么意思？是不是说圣灵只是在我们心里“告诉我们”神爱我们？我们早就知道神爱我们了，这里说的是别的。“浇灌”这个比喻是在说一种“经验”。也就是说，有时候，我们未来必得的那份荣耀盛宴，如今就先尝到一点；有时候，那份将来的荣耀，会在现在以经验的方式临到你。

这就是基督徒喜乐的核心——借着基督、借着信心、借着圣灵所得到的喜乐——它是将来的荣耀的“预尝”。一些老一代的英国牧师，比如理查德·西布斯（Richard Sibbes）和威廉·格思里（William Guthrie），是这样写的（这是 17 世纪的英文）：

西布斯说：“有时候，我们的灵魂在试炼中实在站立不住，于是圣灵就立刻作见证，对我们说：‘我是你的救恩。’我们的心因此被激动、安慰，以至得着说不出来、满有荣光的大喜乐。这样的喜乐是有程度的，有时清楚而强烈，以至我们毫不疑惑；有时疑惑又很快进来。”

格思里说：这不是可听见的声音，我们不会听见什么声音；更像是一道荣耀的光线照满心灵；就像主耶稣在园子里只叫了一声“马利亚”的时候，她的心满被光照、再也不怀疑自己是属他的了。

圣经说：如果你想要那种在任何环境下都扎根、稳固的喜乐，你就不能只停留在头脑中的知识层面——知道自己因恩典得救、知道自己有将来的荣耀——你还需要在心里多次经历神爱的主观浇灌。这“已经”的经验，是对“尚未”荣耀的预尝。

而这样的喜乐，是既顾及“头脑”也顾及“心”的喜乐。

你如果明白这一点，就会发现，这样的喜乐其实正好回应了我们一开始提到的两难处境。一方面：世上的事物很好，但如果你把心全给它们，它们就会让你失望，于是你受伤；另一方面：你若因害怕被伤，就把心抽离，不再给任何东西，你又会变得僵硬、不再真正活着。

C.S. 路易斯的自传叫《被喜乐奇袭》（Surprised by Joy），整本书都在讲：在他信主之前，他总在别的事物里寻找喜乐；每当他找到一个以为能带来喜乐的东西，他就“狂吃猛喝”——第一次读到冰岛传奇故事时，他兴奋极了，后来为了重获那种感觉，他把能找到的冰岛传奇全读了一遍，还学了古挪威语，只为能读原文。结果到头来，他发现并没有得到他以为会得到的那份喜乐。

后来他结交一个朋友，常常一起畅谈，享受那种美好的夜晚。起初，他就对这位朋友“上瘾”：天天要见面，天天想聊天；直到朋友快受不了，说：“我们也许不要每天见面吧。”他在每一个他以为能带给他喜乐的东西上都“狂吃猛喝”。

慢慢地，他开始意识到：真正的喜乐是在神那里，而其他东西只是通道。那些书、那些音乐、那些风景、那些人际关系本身都是有限的，它们无法承载他在其中寻找的那份终极喜乐。

他说：“那些书籍和音乐，如果我把‘美’或‘喜乐’当成在它们里面本身，就会背叛我；它们不过是那喜乐透过它们流出，它们只是渠道。如果我把它们当成那喜乐本身，它们就会变成哑巴的偶像，摧毁那些崇拜它们的人，因为它们不是那喜乐本身，只是‘我们尚未找到的花香’、‘我们尚未听见的乐曲的回音’、‘我们尚未到访的国度传来的消息’。”

当他真正信主之后，他用一个比喻作结：如果你在森林里迷路，第一次看见路牌，那是件大事，你会围着牌子，兴奋地说：“看！这就是路！”可是当你已经在大路上，沿着方向前行，一路上不断遇见路牌时，你就不会每块都停下来久久凝视；你会感激设立路牌的权柄，却不会停在路牌那里，因为你知道：真正的目标是“耶路撒冷”。

他的意思是：食物、朋友、成功、名声、金钱……这些东西都是“路牌”，你可以享受它们，其中有些就像银柱金字，美丽动人；但不要把路牌当成目的地——它们指向的是神自己，是神的城。

这就把我们从那两难中解救出来：既不用害怕享受世上的美好，也不用把心栓死在这些美好上。

最后一个问题：那怎样真正得到这种喜乐？到现在为止，我一直在说“基督徒的喜乐怎样怎样”，那要怎么得着呢？你或许会说：“那就成为基督徒吧。”但需要更具体一点，因为我知道，有很多基督徒并没有多少这样的喜乐。

看这段经文最后的部分——严格来说，足够讲五六篇讲道了——核心就是福音。8–9 节给了一个很美的总结：“惟有基督在我们还作罪人的时候为我们死，神的爱就在此向我们显明了。现在我们既靠着他的血称义，就更要借着他免去神的忿怒。”

“神的忿怒”不是神的坏脾气，而是他对邪恶、公不义的“公义的、稳定的审判性抵挡”。人类参与并制造了罪恶和不义，因此配得刑罚。但耶稣基督在我们还是罪人的时候——注意，是“还是”的时候，不是我们洗心革面之后——就为我们死、担当了这忿怒、这定罪、这刑罚。这就是福音。

福音如何带来喜乐？两方面。第一，福音让你看见自己“危险的巨大程度”。这听上去似乎是负面：你是罪人，你迷失了，你配得刑罚、配得忿怒——这听上去是坏消息。但从福音的内部看，这恰恰是引向喜乐的路径。

有一位讲道者做过这样的比喻：想象你出门旅行时，留朋友在家帮你看家。你回来后，朋友对你说：“有一张账单寄给你，我打开看了——希望你不要介意——然后我替你付掉了，用的是我自己的钱。”那你该怎么回应？答案是：你不知道应该怎么回应。因为你不知道那张账单有多大。若只是一个包裹的邮资补缴，你会说：“哦，谢谢，真好。”若是国税局追讨你多年欠税的巨额账单，而你根本无力偿还，那你就会扑倒在他脚前，说：“你救了我！”

直到你知道那笔债有多大，你才知道自己该有多感恩、多喜乐。J.C. 莱尔（J.C. Ryle）说：你之所以会被世上的债务、财务压力压得喘不过气，是因为你还没真正意识到，那笔真正能沉没你的债——罪债——已经被完全还清。

当你从心里接纳福音的“坏消息”——你比自己以为的更败坏、更有罪、更危险——你就会同时被“好消息”所击中：那笔唯一真正能沉没你的债，已经被耶稣完全支付；那唯一真正能永远杀死你的疾病，已经在他身上得着医治。癌症都不能真正毁灭你，因为你若属基督，你就有“神荣耀的盼望”。

第二，福音让你看见耶稣的痛苦是多么巨大。在约翰福音 16 章，有一段看上去有点奇怪的话：耶稣在被钉十字架前一晚要安慰门徒，他说：“妇人生产的时候就忧愁，因为她的时候到了，既生了孩子，就不再记念那苦楚，因欢喜世上生了一个人。”然后他说：“你们现在也是忧愁，但我要再见你们，你们的心就喜乐，这喜乐也没有人能夺去。”

在那个时代，女人生孩子几乎一定要经过极大的痛苦，而且很多人会死在产床上。也就是说，一个妇人若要生出新生命、享受新生命的喜悦，就必须进入一个充满痛苦、危险、甚至死亡的“隧道”。耶稣说：“这就是我现在要做的事，我要像那妇人一样，通过巨大的痛苦，为你们生出新的生命、带出你们的喜乐。”

你怎样得着喜乐？你看着耶稣说：“主啊，你失去了所有喜乐，好叫我得着永恒的喜乐；你进入极深的痛苦，好叫我得着新的生命。”你看见他为你所做的，这正是圣灵把神的爱浇灌在你心里的途径。

第 5 节说，这才是喜乐的关键：有时候圣灵把神的爱浇灌在我们心里。那怎么发生？不是抽象地说：“主啊，让我感觉被爱，我等着呢。”而是回到十字架，看见他所承担的债、所忍受的忿怒、所放弃的荣耀；看见他如何像生产的妇人一样，忍受十字架的痛苦，为的是摆在前面的那喜乐——那喜乐就是你，就是你的得救和荣耀。

当你这样思想、这样祷告、这样默想福音，圣灵就在这些具体的真理上工作，把神的爱真实地浇灌到你心里，使你拥有一种根本不再依赖环境的喜乐。

这就是它的运作方式。去得着它吧——它已经预备好，向你敞开。

今天，提姆·凯勒要展开讲解圣灵的一个果子，带我们看见：从「努力做一个好人」到「从内到外真正改变」到底意味着什么。

今天的经文来自罗马书 5:1–11：

「所以，我们既因信称义，就借着我们的主耶稣基督得与神相和。我们又借着他，因信得进入现在所站的这恩典中，并且欢欢喜喜盼望神的荣耀。不但如此，就是在患难中也是欢欢喜喜的；因为知道患难生忍耐，忍耐生老练，老练生盼望；盼望不至于羞耻，因为所赐给我们的圣灵，将神的爱浇灌在我们心里。

因为基督在我们还软弱的时候，就按所定的日期为罪人死。为义人死，是少有的；为仁人死，或者有敢做的；惟有基督在我们还作罪人的时候为我们死，神的爱就在此向我们显明了。

现在我们既靠着他的血称义，就更要借着他免去神的忿怒。因为我们作仇敌的时候，且借着神儿子的死得与神和好，既已和好，就更要因他的生得救了。不但如此，我们既借着我主耶稣基督得与神和好，也就借着他以神为乐。」

这就是神的话。

圣经有个前提——当然圣经有很多前提——但今天我们要思想的这个前提是：在「道德上被约束的心」和「被超自然改变的心」之间，有着天壤之别。

一种是靠意志力压制你的自我中心、惧怕和各种问题；另一种则是圣灵亲自、永久地改变你的心——不是靠意志力的力量，而是靠圣灵自己的能力。接下来几周，我们要一系列看看「被超自然改变的心」有哪些特征。

你怎么知道，自己只是在「努力当一个好人」，还是圣灵真的在你生命里带来了改变？

答案就是去看加拉太书第 5 章里所说、圣灵所结的「果子」——仁爱、喜乐、和平、忍耐、恩慈……这一整组的品格，都是「被超自然改变的心」所结出的特征。我们会一周看一个。今晚我们要看的，是「喜乐」。

罗马书 5:1–11 这段经文告诉我们关于喜乐的三件事：

第一，喜乐非常重要；
第二，基督徒的喜乐是独特的；
第三，这种基督徒的喜乐从哪里来。

所以，是三个重点：喜乐的重要性；基督徒的喜乐有什么独特；它从哪里来。

第一，喜乐的重要性。

第 1 节谈到「因信称义」：「所以，我们既因信称义，就借着我们的主耶稣基督得与神相和。」保罗在这里，其实是在总结他在 1–4 章中已经讲过的一切。那么，「因信称义」是什么意思？

所有其它宗教都在说：你如果照着该做的去活，上帝就会赐福你、接纳你。但只有基督教在说：你先白白领受接纳和祝福——借着信心，因着耶稣的功劳，而不是你的功劳——然后你才开始、而且也必然会照着你「该」活的方式去活。

这是一个彻底的颠倒，非常革命性。成为基督徒，就是一个「因信称义的人」：你与神和好，因耶稣所做的一切被接纳。

那什么才是真正基督徒生命的主要印记？最主要的特征是什么？

按罗马书 5:1–11，这个答案很清楚。第 2 节后半说：「并且欢欢喜喜盼望神的荣耀。」第 3 节接着说：「不但如此，就是在患难中也是欢欢喜喜的。」到了第 11 节：「不但如此，我们……也就借着他以神为乐。」

约翰·斯托得在他写的《罗马书》注释里说，从这段经文可以很清楚地看出：因信称义之人的主要标志，就是喜乐。主要的、首要的标志就是喜乐。也就是说，这段经文在告诉我们，要活出一个基督徒的生命，甚至要活出一个真正的人生，你在内心深处，需要一个「喜乐的中心」，需要在你最深处有一个巨大的喜乐。

但很多人并不这样认为。很多人反而害怕追求喜乐，以为那条路最后只会让人失望。

举个例子：艾米·布卢姆（Amy Bloom）。过去这些年，你可能注意到，关于「幸福研究、快乐心理学」的书越来越多——你看到了吗？一大堆书在研究是什么让我们快乐、怎样才能更快乐，也有一大堆关于「积极思考」的书，教你如何掌控人生，好让自己可以快乐。

然而，大体而言，「知识界」——也就是那些知识分子、作家、评论人、艺术家、哲学家——是非常反感这一整套「快乐」的说法的。艾米·布卢姆几个月前在《纽约时报》上写了一篇专栏，题目就叫《对幸福的抱怨》（The Rap on Happiness）。她在里面这样说：

「聪明人会‘吐槽’幸福，甚至对关于幸福的书不只是吐槽，而是嗤之以鼻，我们这样做已经好几个世纪了。因为在我们看来，那些幸福研究和积极心理学的东西，并不是魔鬼的作品，而是……蠢人的作品。」

接着她解释了其中几个原因，而最主要的一个是：

「问题其实不在那些追求快乐的人，也不在他们写的书，而就在快乐本身。快乐是短暂的，它可以很深，却常常转瞬即逝。世界会从我们身边溜走，花瓣会凋落，所爱的人会死去。再多时髦的冷笑，也不能阻止我们享受阳光洒在脸上的那份惬意，更不能拯救我们——作为一个成年人——不去意识到：这一切都不会长久。」

她在说的是：如果你真的想要人生里的平静，就不要追求快乐；因为任何你从中得到喜乐的东西，都不会长久。无论是什么，最后都会让你失望。所以，得到内心宁静的唯一办法，就是根本不要去追求喜乐，不要去追求幸福。

我完全明白这种感受。当我还是一个 13 岁男孩时，那是 1964 年的夏天——你可以自己算算我多大——我支持的球队是费城费城人队。联赛还剩 12 场的时候，他们领先第二名圣路易斯红雀队 6 场。12 场球，领先 6 场——肯定要进世界大赛了！结果，接下来发生了什么事呢？有些棒球历史迷可能知道：他们连输 10 场。整整 10 连败。然后他们就……

结果他们根本没进世界大赛。

当你是一个 13 岁的男孩，而那支球队就是「你的队」，那 10 场比赛里，我每一个投球、每一次打击、每一个出局都跟着一起熬。那段时间，我仿佛经历了一千次死亡——那种煎熬，在一个 13 岁男孩的世界里，是无法想象的痛苦。最后一切尘埃落定，我的心真的是碎掉了。现在我们可以笑着说，但当时真的很糟。我心里说的是：再也不要这样了。

我再也不会把我的心交给——好，你可以在这里填上任何东西。因为我们每个人的生命里，几乎都有类似的经历。

有些人直到今天，情绪上还停留在 13 岁男孩的阶段，让他们心碎的仍然只是某支球队的输赢。但对大多数人来说呢，换成了别的东西：男人或女人、爱情、事业、成功，诸如此类。

我们的心渴望喜乐，像一个巨大的真空泵，有着强烈的「吸力」，会牢牢吸附在某样东西上，以为：「这个一定会让我幸福。」

而当它让你失望的时候——它确实会让你失望，因为它不会永远长存——你就会说：「好吧，我这辈子要得到内心安宁，唯一的办法就是不再追求喜乐。」你开始追求的是哲学家所说的「抽离」。

事实上，这也是佛教所讲的核心之一：抽离、放下。很多古代哲学家，尤其是希腊哲学家，讲的也是同一条路：抽离自己，不要把你的心真正交给任何东西，这样你才能保持平静。不要追求喜乐，不要追求幸福。

但这里有个问题。约瑟夫·爱普斯坦（Joseph Epstein）是一位非常出色的学者，在西北大学教英文很多年，也做过《American Scholar》期刊的主编，后来退休。他最近在《圣母大学》的一份杂志上写了一篇文章，其中提到古代希腊哲学家伊壁鸠鲁（Epicurus）的一个故事。某一次，伊壁鸠鲁把他的学生们召集到花园里，对他们说：「我可以给你一个四步处方，把你生命里的焦虑完全除掉。只要做这四件事，你就能完全平静。」他说，如果所有人都愿意照做，我甚至可以让整个世界都没有焦虑。

你们想知道是哪四步吗？

好，我们来看爱普斯坦对这「四步」的总结：

第一步：不要相信上帝或诸神。
为什么？接着看。

第二步：既然你不再相信神，那么你就不必再害怕死亡。死亡，其实不过是「虚无」——不过是一场永恒而无梦的睡眠而已。没有神，没有天堂地狱，所以死亡没什么好怕的。你死后就像你出生以前那样——一片空白，一个永恒而无梦的睡眠。

第三步：不要害怕痛苦。
为什么？因为痛苦要么很快会减弱并消失；要么会变得越来越强烈，而一旦如此，死亡就离你不远了——而我们刚刚说过，死亡也没什么可怕的。

第四步：不要试图去获得任何东西——不要追求金钱、名声或权势。
为什么？因为若你去追求这些，又没有得到，你当然会很痛苦；但即便你得到了，它们也永远不可能给你与你为之付出的代价相称的价值——「这场游戏不值得你点燃那支蜡烛」。

以上就是爱普斯坦对伊壁鸠鲁「四步走，告别焦虑」的总结：

忘掉上帝；
忘掉死亡；
忘掉痛苦；
忘掉获取（任何东西）。

然后他评论说：按哲学家的看法，要得到内心平静，唯一的路就是不再追求喜乐——把自己从一切事物中抽离出来，不再把心系在任何东西上。

爱普斯坦的结论是：
「我猜，这套方案大概是有效的。但即使它真能奏效，这种对人生彻底抽离的方式，能算是一种足够丰富、足够有层次、值得去过的人生吗？很多人会说‘是’，我不在其列。」

其实，C.S. 路易斯说得更优雅。他说，如果你不想让自己的心被伤害，如果你想永远保持平静，那就不要把你的心交给任何东西。不要把心交给费城人队，也不要真正把心交给任何人，任何东西。是的，他并不是说你不能结婚，但他的意思是：不要把「整个心」都交给任何人或任何事。把你的心放进一个小小的匣子里，小心收藏，以确保它永远不会破碎。

但在那个匣子里，你的心会慢慢变成「不可破碎、不可触及、也不可救赎」的东西。

爱普斯坦和路易斯在说的是：一方面，如果你把心交给某些事物，它们终究会让你失望；如果你去追求喜乐，必然会经历失望。可另一方面，如果你为了避免失望而选择抽离，说「我谁也不爱，我对什么都不投入」，这同样会把你去人性化，让你的心变得又硬又冷。

那还有没有出路呢？

有的。为什么？因为这是一篇讲道，而我们刚刚讲的只是第一点。现在要进入第二点。

第二点：基督徒的喜乐是独特的，这种喜乐能带你走出这个两难。

怎么说呢？有两个方面让基督徒的喜乐显得不同寻常。第一，基督徒的喜乐不是建立在环境之上的。

你看第 3 节怎么说：「不但如此，就是在患难中也是欢欢喜喜的。」

什么是「患难」？

「患难」就是那些你所喜爱的、有利的环境被拿走了——也就是「有利的处境」正在离你而去。

这也是为什么我想把「喜乐」这个词和世人所说的「快乐」区分开。如果你不介意，我认为基督徒的「喜乐」并不是世界所说的那种「happiness」。世界所说的「快乐」，其实就是：努力掌控你的人生，让自己的处境一直维持在有利状态。

你知道现在还有一个网站叫 happiness.com 吗？他们在首页上列出「确保快乐的五个关键要素」：

第一，要拥有基本生活条件：食物、住房、健康，以及安全感；
第二，要有充足的睡眠；
第三，要有对你来说真正重要的亲密关系；
第四，要有一个关爱别人、也关爱自己的生活方式；
第五，要有一份让你感到真正有兴趣、能投入其中的工作。

他们说：只要你具备这五条，你就会快乐。

你看上去可能会说：「是啊，这听起来挺合理的。要快乐当然需要这些。」

但你有没有意识到，这样说其实有多荒谬？大部分人类，在大部分地方、在大部分历史时期，从来没有同时拥有过这些条件。那么，对他们来说又该怎么办？

那所有那些一辈子都没有足够的食物、住房、健康和安全感的人呢？那些今天仍然如此、而且未来也不大可能拥有这些条件的人呢？还有那些永远没有「有趣又能投入的工作」的人呢？

换句话说，这个世界所相信的其实就是：快乐等于「把我的处境调到刚刚好的状态」。当事情进展顺利、环境对我有利时，我就快乐——这就是他们的定义。

但对地球上大多数时代、大多数地方的大多数人来说，他们从未拥有过这样的有利环境。按这种定义，他们岂不是注定永远无法「快乐」？

是的，如果你用现代文化对「快乐」的定义，他们确实是得不到的。但有一种「喜乐」是向他们也敞开的——基督徒的喜乐根本不是建基在环境之上的。

这里说「我们在患难中也是欢欢喜喜」，并不是在说「为」患难而喜乐。你不会说：「哇，我受苦了，太棒了！」那是受虐狂，不是圣经的教导。这里说的是「在」患难之中仍旧喜乐。

那怎么可能呢？当你所有的处境都在走下坡路，你怎么还能喜乐？

第 11 节给出答案：「我们……以神为乐。」

神自己并不受环境摆布，也不会被处境推来推去。所以，基督徒的喜乐扎根的对象，是那位超越环境的神。

更有意思的是，第 3–4 节说：「我们在患难中也是欢欢喜喜的；因为知道患难生忍耐，忍耐生老练，老练生盼望。」这种盼望指的，是前面第 2 节所说「盼望神的荣耀」的盼望——将来的荣耀，叫我们现在就能欢喜。

第 3 节在说的是：患难反而能把这种盼望炼得更深，而盼望越深，喜乐就越大。换句话说，基督徒的喜乐跟世上的快乐完全不同——不是说在环境变糟的时候勉强「维持一下」，而是说在环境最不利时，喜乐反而可以被加深，甚至通常就是在这种时候被加深。

你可能会问：这怎么可能？

这就好比你小时候，你妈妈会一直对你说：「吃饭前别吃糖！」如果那时她想

大概在吃饭前半个小时，如果你在那时候吃薯片、糖果或各种甜食，你妈妈准会冲过来说：「不要吃那个！」

为什么？她会说：「会把你的胃口搞坏的。」

妈妈们当然并非总是对的——她们常常会错，但从不缺乏自信。不过在这一点上，她们确实是对的。

问题在于：糖果会给你一种「糖分带来的兴奋」感，让你不觉得饿，却掩盖了身体真正的需要——你的身体需要蛋白质，需要各种营养，而这些糖根本提供不了。糖会给你一阵短暂的兴奋，却掩饰了你其实缺乏营养的事实。

同样地，性、金钱、权力、成功——这些有利的环境，对属灵生命来说，其实就是「糖」。

很多基督徒会说：「哦，我当然相信有神，也知道自己要上天堂。」但在日常里，你真正把「喜乐、满足感」建基在的，还是那些环境、条件、成就身上。一旦这些「糖」被拿走，你就被迫转向那一桌真正的「盛宴」——也就是神自己，去寻求你的灵魂真正需要的营养。

环境变糟的时候，会把你逼向神，使你慢慢长出一种「沉着」、「力量」，以及一种无论环境如何都不会消失的坚韧喜乐。

诗篇可以深深塑造你亲近神的方式。连耶稣自己，都倚靠诗篇去面对人生各种处境，甚至面对死亡。在提姆和凯西·凯勒所写的 365 天灵修书《耶稣的诗歌》（The Songs of Jesus）中，你会每天读到一段诗篇和相应的默想，带来新鲜的圣经洞见。如果你还没有固定的灵修节奏，这本书是一个很好的起点；如果你已经有稳定的读经祷告习惯，那么借着诗篇祷告，可以帮助你把最深的情感和问题带到神面前，经历与他更深的亲密。

当你奉献支持 Gospel in Life 的事工，他们会把这本灵修书作为感谢礼物寄给你，帮助更多人听见耶稣的福音。你可以访问 gospelandlife.com/give 进行奉献和索取。

所以第一，基督徒的喜乐是独特的，因为它不是建立在环境上。

第二，基督徒的喜乐也独特，因为它同时「已经」又「尚未」实现。

怎么理解呢？一方面，第 2 节后半说：「并且欢欢喜喜盼望神的荣耀。」这是什么意思？

意思是，当你成为基督徒时，因为你的得救不是建基在你自己的好行为和努力上，而是建基在基督的工作上，所以你对自己的未来有一个「确定性」。

还记得我们刚刚说的：所有其他宗教都是「你先照着该做的去做，然后神才会祝福你、接纳你」。这就意味着，如果你相信自己之所以蒙福、之所以与神有关系，是因为你活得够好——因为你在祷告、在行善、在遵守律法——那么，你对自己的终局就永远没有真正的确定感。因为你永远可以问：「那如果有一天我撑不下去呢？如果我松懈、失败、跌倒怎么办？」你还没走到人生终点，你不知道自己将来会不会失手、会不会做出极其糟糕的事。所以那种「靠自己赚来救恩」的宗教，会在你心里制造一种对未来的深深不确定。

但基督教说：「如今，那些在基督耶稣里的就不定罪了。」（罗 8:1）

你可以绝对肯定，有一天你会真正分享「神荣耀的盼望」——你要在更新之后的世界里、在神面前生活。当那一天来到，当你一脚踏进那样的世界，你会忍不住跺一跺脚说：「我终于到家了！这才是我的祖国。我本来就属于这里。这就是我一生都在寻找的地方，只是直到现在才真正看见。」

这种确定性的认识，就是「盼望神的荣耀」。它还没完全来到，是「尚未」，但它真实存在、一定会来，是「已经」被应许的。

在圣经里，「盼望」这个词，不是我们今天口语里那种「希望如此、但不确定」的意思。圣经中的「盼望」，指的是：对将要发生、但尚未完全实现之事的「生命塑造性的确定」。你虽然现在还没完全得着，但单单是知道、思想、默想圣经里关于那未来的应许，就已经能在现在为你带来稳固，给你一种在环境摇晃中仍能站立的「定力」。

但问题来了：难道我们现在只有这样的「将来盼望」吗？就是在苦难中对自己说：「我知道将来会好起来的。」就只有这样吗？

不是的，还有更多。

请看第 4–5 节：「忍耐生老练，老练生盼望。盼望不至于羞耻，因为所赐给我们的圣灵，将神的爱浇灌在我们心里。」

这里说「浇灌」，是什么意思？是不是只是说，圣灵告诉我们：「神爱你哦。」好像只是一条信息？不对，我们本来就知道神爱我们——福音已经告诉我们了。那这里的「浇灌」指的是什么？

「浇灌」这个比喻，说的是一种经历，一种被充满的体验：好像把水从天上倾倒下来，让你浸泡其中。

这段经文在说的是：有时候，那将来在荣耀里要享受的「盛宴」，会先让你在现在尝到几口；有时候，那将要显现的荣耀，会在现在短暂地让你预尝。你会尝到一小块那将来的喜乐，成为现在的「预尝」。

这正是基督徒喜乐的核心：借着基督、借着信心、借着圣灵，你可以预先尝到将来的荣耀。几个早期的英国牧师，如 17 世纪的理查德·西布斯（Richard Sibbes）、威廉·格思里（William Guthrie），这样描述这种经历：

西布斯说：有时候，在试炼中我们的灵里承受不住；这时圣灵就亲自给我们一个直接的见证，对我们说：「我是你的拯救。」于是我们的心就被激动，得着「说不出来、满有荣光的大喜乐」。这种喜乐也有程度的差别：有时那种体验极其清晰、有力，让我们毫不怀疑；有时疑惑又很快回来。

格思里则说：这并不是一段可听见的声音，而更像是一道荣耀的光线充满人的心，如同主在园中只叫了一声「马利亚」——那一声就充满了她的心，使她再也不怀疑自己是属他的。

这样圣灵的显现是何等荣耀。

如果你没有这种「被神浇灌的爱」作根基的喜乐，如果你只是靠环境好不好来支撑自己的心，你是站不住的。

世界上的快乐，是建立在「顺利的环境」上，非常脆弱；而基督徒的喜乐却不一样。如果你从来没有在祷告中直接「经历」到神的爱浇灌在你心里，只停留在头脑上的知道，你就很难真正拥有那种在任何环境里都站得住的喜乐。

这种经历，就像是那将来的盛宴，先在现今给了你一小口「预尝」。它不会天天发生，也不会持续不断。正如西布斯说的，有时候很强烈、有时候很微弱、有时候很快又过去了。但当你经历过，你会知道那是真的——即便我作为一个长老会牧师这么说，听起来有点怪，但事实就是：这样的经历和你头脑中的知识是相辅相成的。

一方面，你知道自己因着恩典得救，你知道「神的荣耀」是你的命定；另一方面，这不只是一个客观的道理写在书上，而是一个主观的、临到你心里的体验。头脑知道，心也真切地感觉到。圣经说，基督徒的喜乐同时满足了头与心的需要。

你看，现在这个「喜乐」怎样解答我们在第一点提出的两难？

第一点的两难是：这个世界的美好事物本身很好，但如果你把心完全交给它们，它们最终一定会让你失望，于是你被迫抽离，不再敢欢喜。

C.S. 路易斯的自传名叫《意外的喜乐》（Surprised by Joy）。他说，在信主以前，他总是想从各种事物中找到那种「喜乐」——每当他觉得某件事可能带来那样的喜乐，他就会在那件事上「狂吃猛喝」。

比如，第一次读到冰岛传奇（Icelandic saga）的时候，他非常着迷，就想再一次找回那种感觉。他怎么办？他把所有冰岛传奇都翻出来读一遍，甚至去学古诺斯语，好能够读原文。可是在这个过程中，他发现，那种「以为会带来喜乐」的体验始终没有真正出现。

然后，他交到一个好朋友。你大概也体验过：有时候跟好朋友聊到深夜，那种晚上回家的感觉非常美好。路易斯也是这样，一开始他就拼命「刷」这位朋友——几乎每天晚上都要见面聊天。到后来，朋友只好说：「呃，今晚先别了吧，或者最近先停一停。」他在不停地「狂刷」各种东西。

在慢慢接近信主、开始意识到「喜乐背后有一位神」的过程中，他这样写道：

「我渐渐意识到，那些书、那些音乐——我原以为里面藏着‘美’和‘喜乐’——一旦我把‘盼望’放在它们身上，它们就会背叛我。真正的喜乐并不在它们里面，它只是透过它们临到我。这些东西，这些让喜乐临到的事物，如果被误认为就是那‘喜乐本身’，它们就会变成哑巴的偶像，最后把敬拜它们之人的心弄得粉碎。因为它们不是喜乐本身，只不过是我们尚未找到的一朵花所散发的香气，是我们尚未听见的一支曲子的回音，是我们尚未去过的一个国度所传来的消息。」

在自传最后一章、最后一页，他回顾自己已经成为基督徒的那一刻，这样写：

「多年来，我一直以为‘喜乐在这里、喜乐在那里’，于是我追着风景、追着朋友、追着书和各种作品跑；后来我终于明白，那喜乐是从神而来，只是透过那些事物临到我。」

最后，他用了一个很有意思的比喻——我觉得可以很准确地回应我们一开始的那种困惑：

「如果你在树林里迷了路，然后第一次看见一块路牌，那对你来说就是一件大事。第一个看见路牌的人会喊：‘看！’然后大家就围上来，盯着那块路牌看，说：‘太好了，终于知道方向了。’

但如果你已经找到了大路，并且每隔几英里就能看见路牌，你就不会每次都停下来盯着路牌看。那些路牌当然会鼓励你，你也会感激那个竖立路牌的权威。但你不会再把注意力都停留在路牌上——就算它的柱子是银子、字母是黄金——因为你宁可身在耶路撒冷。」

他的意思是：如果你真的迷路了，第一次看到路牌自然会非常兴奋。但如果你已经知道自己正往哪里去，知道路牌所指向的那座城，你就不会一直停在那儿看路牌。

他发现，食物、朋友、成就、掌声、名誉、金钱——所有这些我们以为「如果有了，就能得到喜乐」的东西，其实都只是一块块「路牌」。

要好好享受它们——有些确实非常美好，有些就像「银柱金字」那样漂亮。但千万不要把「路牌」当成「目的地」本身。它们真正指向的，是「神的城」——是神自己。

这就让我们从两种极端中被释放出来：既不需要害怕享受今生的美好，也不会再把心过度系在它们上面。

最后一个问题：那我们怎样真正得着这种喜乐呢？

到目前为止，我们一直在描述基督徒的喜乐「是什么样」的——但要怎样「得到」呢？

你可能会说：「那大概就是成为基督徒吧。」

是，但我们还可以说得更具体一点，因为我认识太多已经是基督徒，却几乎没有什么喜乐的人。

看看这段经文的最后部分。坦白说，后半段足够讲五六篇道——的确也有不少人这么讲过。但核心其实现就是福音。

第 8–9 节给出了一个非常精炼的福音总结：「惟有基督在我们还作罪人的时候为我们死，神的爱就在此向我们显明了。现在我们既靠着他的血称义，就更要借着他免去神的忿怒。」

「神的忿怒」不是神心情不好、发脾气；而是他对邪恶和不义那种公义的、审判性的反对——一种稳固的、司法性的敌对。人类因为参与了邪恶和不义，本来应当承受刑罚。但基督在我们还作罪人的时候——注意，不是我们先把自己整理干净之后——就在十字架上替我们承担了那忿怒、那定罪、那刑罚。

这就是福音。

那福音如何带来喜乐？有两个非常实际、非常关键的层面。

第一，福音让你看见自己罪的严重程度有多大……（下文略）

但福音的第一层作用，是让你看见自己究竟多么有危险。

这听起来有点反直觉。因为从外面看，福音的第一部分——「你是罪人，你迷失了，你理当受刑罚，理当承受神的忿怒」——似乎非常负面。你可能会问：「这有什么好？」

当然，这话听起来不舒服。但你如果从里面真正明白，会发现这其实在向你揭示：你以前完全不知道的「债务有多大、危险有多深」。

有位讲道者打了个比方：

想象你出门旅行，把房子交给一个朋友暂住。你回来的时候，朋友对你说：「有一张账单寄给你，我擅自帮你拆了，希望你不要介意。我看了金额，然后帮你付掉了，用的是我自己的钱。」

现在问题来了：你该如何回应他？

答案是：你根本不知道该怎么回应。为什么？因为你不知道那张账单的金额有多大。你不知道那「债」有多重。

如果那只是一件包裹的「补交邮资」？你大概会说：「哦，谢谢你，真是太贴心了。」

但如果那是一张税局寄来的「多年欠税总账单」，而你自己根本无力偿还——而他帮你一口气还清了？那你就不只是说一句「谢谢」，而是会几乎跪倒在他脚前，说：「你救了我。」

换句话说，在你真正知道「账单有多大」之前，你根本不知道该有多感恩、多喜乐。

利物浦的主教赖尔（J.C. Ryle）说：

「你之所以会为今世的财务压力烦躁不安，是因为你还没意识到：那个真正致命的债——罪的债——已经被偿清了。那是唯一能真正毁掉你的债，而它已经被付清了。」

当你看到这一点，即便你现在还有其他债务、还有各种经济压力，那些都成了「大海里的小水花」。因为那唯一真正「能拖垮你」的债已经被取消了。

从外面看，「你比自己以为的更败坏，理当受刑罚」听起来像是坏消息；但从内里真正接受福音的那一刻起，这反而成了喜乐泉源——你开始说：「好，我还有债、还有疾病，但那个真正能毁灭我的债已经还清了；那个真正能永远杀死我的疾病已经被医治了。连癌症都不能真的毁掉我，因为我属于他，也有神荣耀的盼望。」

第一，福音让你看见自己原本的危险有多大；
第二，福音让你看见耶稣为你所承受的痛苦有多深。

在约翰福音 16 章有一段很「奇怪」的经文（我确实觉得挺奇怪）。耶稣在上十字架前的那一夜，要安慰他的门徒，说：「接下来对你们会很难。」然后他用了一个比喻：

「妇人生产的时候就忧愁，因为她的时候到了；既生了孩子，就不再记念那苦楚，因欢喜世上生了一个人。」（约 16:21）

接着他说：「你们现在也是忧愁……」意思是：你们也会经历这样的过程。

我每次看到这段经文，都要去翻注释书，确认自己是不是想多了。结果每一个注释家几乎都同意：耶稣在这里把自己比作一位产妇。

你要记得，在古代，女人生孩子不只是很疼，而是在「极度疼痛、并且随时可能死亡」的环境中生产。也就是说，要有一个新生命带来的喜乐，女人必须进入一条「极其痛苦、危险的隧道」。

耶稣说：「我现在要做的，就是这样一件事。」

他说：「我就像那位妇人，为了把喜乐、新生命带给你们，要自己走进这条痛苦与死亡的隧道。」

那我们怎样在这之中长出喜乐呢？

我们凝视他说：「主耶稣，你失去了一切喜乐，好叫我可以得着永恒的喜乐。你经历了极大的煎熬，好叫我得以进入新生命。」

这就是第 5 节所说的关键：「所赐给我们的圣灵，将神的爱浇灌在我们心里。」——这爱是怎样浇灌的？

不是抽象地说：「主啊，让我感觉被爱。我在等。」

不是这样。那太抽象了。

真正发生的是：你开始反复默想耶稣所做的一切——他如何像那位产妇，为你进入痛苦和死亡；他如何失去自己的一切喜乐，为要把喜乐给你。当你这样看着他的时候，圣灵就借着这些真理，在某些时刻把神的爱浇灌在你心里，让你实实在在「尝到」自己被爱得多深。

这种被爱所充满的喜乐，会给你能力去承受任何处境。

所以，福音带来喜乐的两个关键：

一，它让你看见自己原本所处的危险有多大——以至于你现在所有的问题，都显得渺小，因为真正致命的问题已经被解决了；
二，它让你看见耶稣为你付出的代价有多大——以至于当你细细思想、日复一日地在祷告中默想这些事时，圣灵会在有些时刻，把神的爱浇灌在你心里，使你知道自己何等被爱，从而得着一种在任何环境下都能站立得住的喜乐。

这就是它的运作方式。

去抓住它吧——这喜乐是向你敞开的。

我们一起祷告：

父啊，谢谢你赐下喜乐，也赐给我们一个远比现在所经历的更深、更大的喜乐容量。求你让那些还没有真正「进入」福音的人——还没有真正接受、还没有借着信心与你建立关系、还没有经历因信称义的人——今天就向你敞开，好叫他们也能开始明白这喜乐：在你的荣耀盼望中，在患难之中，在你自己里面的喜乐。阿们。

……在面对未来的时候，在面对患难的时候，在你自己面前，都有这样的喜乐。

我也为已经信主的我们祷告，因为我们在很大程度上，仍旧把幸福感系在今世的环境上。求你把这样的喜乐赐给我们，把我们扎根、建立在喜乐之中。求你让我们经历你的爱，好叫我们得着与你儿子相似的喜乐——正是因为那摆在前面的喜乐，他才忍受了十字架；照样，因着你赐给我们的喜乐，我们也能为他忍受一切。

奉他宝贵的名祷告，阿们。
