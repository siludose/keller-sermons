## English Transcript / 英文原文

Today, on Gospel and Life, Tim Keller shows us that the Bible has incredibly helpful  and practical wisdom we can apply to the work we do. Wisdom you may find surprising, even life-changing. I want to talk about two quotes, two things that John Coltrane said about the relationship  between God and His music. And I think each of them tells us something very significant. The first one tells us something about the relationship of music and art to God.

And the second one talks about our relationship of our work in general to God. Another way to put it is this. Coltrane's first quote points to music as evangelism. The second quote points to music as service. Now, when I use the word evangelism, I hope for a moment you can sort of shake free your  mind from any association that word with politics, fundamentalism, and remember that evangelism  means good news of hope.

Here's the first quote. John Coltrane says overall, I think the main thing a musician would like to do is give  a picture to the listener of the many wonderful things that he knows and senses in the universe. That's what I would like to do. I think that's one of the greatest things you can do in life, and we all try to do it in  some way. The musician is through his music.

Now, what Coltrane is saying is that music, not just the words to a song, but the music  itself is a form of evangelism. Music can tell the most hopeless heart that there's hope, the most meaningless heart that  there's meaning. No matter what you believe with your head, music tells you that your life is not a tale  told by an idiot, full of sounded fury, signifying nothing. Music has a way of coming to you and saying in spite of how you feel, there is hope, there  is meaning. Stephen J.

Gould, the late Harvard paleontologist, wrote this, he says, we are here simply because  one odd group of fish had a peculiar anatomy that just happened to be able to transform into  legs for terrestrial creatures. We are here simply because common struck the earth at a particular time and wiped out  dinosaurs giving mammals a chance. We yearn for a higher answer, but none exists. We are not here for any purpose at all. We have to construct any meaning to our lives ourselves.

Now, what he's simply saying is this, we yearn to believe that we're here for purpose  that there is meaning in life, that there is hope. But if there is no God, there's none. There isn't any. You can tell yourself that there is, but there really isn't. You can yearn for a higher answer, but there isn't.

But Ashley Kahn, a person with Stephen J. Gould's exact same beliefs about the universe,  wrote a book called A Love Supreme, the story of John Coltrane's signature album. And in it, he says this, as I listened to the album again and again, I felt impelled  to address Coltrane's impassioned spirituality, though I consider myself a dedicated  agnostic and diehard rationalist. I am ready to admit that there is much that can seem to be the handiwork of some eternal  force under spiritual direction. Very begrudgingly, and by the way, John told me he knows this guy, knows Ashley Kahn, very  begrudgingly, here's what Kahn says.

I have the same view of the universe that Stephen J. Gould has. As far as I know, I'm a hard-nosed rationalist, we're not here for any purpose, we're not here. We weren't created. We're just here by accident.

There is no meaning in life. There is no such thing as significance. But when he hears the music, his heart tells him something different. When he hears the music, he can't not know. He can't not know that there is a love that lasts forever, that there's truth, that there's  meaning.

The music evangelizes him. His head tells him these things don't exist. God doesn't exist. But his heart knows better, and the music reminds his heart of that, and the music confirms  it. And actually, those of you who are artists in any form, art has the power to do that.

And if you are an artist, whether you know it or not, you are using that power, but how  much more fulfilling your life would be if you knew what you're doing. So first of all, I think the first thing that Coltrane shows us is that connection, spiritual  connection between art and great music, especially, and how great music evangelized, secondly, though,  Coltrane actually points to music as service, and this actually applies, not just to musicians  and artists, but to us all. He says, in the liner notes of a love supreme, he says, during the year 1957, I experienced  by the grace of God a spiritual awakening which was to lead me to a richer, fuller, more  productive life. At that time, in gratitude, I humbly asked to be given the means and privilege to make  others happy through music, to inspire them to realize more and more of their capacities  for living meaningful lives. Because there certainly is meaning to life, and I feel this has been granted to me through  his grace, all praise to God.

Now, actually, you have both of the themes in that quote, but I want to point out what  he says about his now-his-work in service. Stephen J. Gold was right when he said, if you think life is meaningless, what am I who  you are? You've got to create a meaning for yourself. And one of the ways most of us, especially in a place like New York, one of the ways  most of us find a way to make sure where you know we're significant is through our work.

It's through our work by doing it well, and by moving ourselves ahead, through our work,  we say, now I know I have significance. In other words, we take our work and we make that as we make it all about us. You see, if the way in which you know you've got meaning in life and the way in which  you know you've got significance in worth is your music. Then the music, ironically, is about you. And the paradox is, when the music's about you, it's not usually very good music.

You know, there's a place where CS Lewis, who was an artist, said, the artist who's trying  desperately to be original will never be original. The artist who's trying desperately to make a good impression is not going to make a  very good impression. If you use your work as a desperate search, a desperate effort to give yourself meaning  in life, ironically you won't do a very good job with your work, but culture and something  happened to change culture and changed all that for him, that one night he played his  piece of love supreme, you know, 32-minute piece outpouring of praise and thanks. And he did an incredible night, and he stepped down, and he was heard to say when he was  done, none could admit us. Now those are the first two words in the Latin, first two Latin words of something that  Simeon said in Luke chapter 2 when he'd seen the baby Jesus, and he realized he'd seen  the Messiah.

Simeon says, now let thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word from my eyes  have seen my salvation. And what culture he was actually saying is, I've done it. I've done everything I was put here on the earth to do. I'm ready to go if I have to. Now where does it get that contentment?

If you have experienced a supreme love so that you know he loves you, regardless of how  well you do out there on the stage, regardless of how well it claimed you are in your work,  if you know he loves you in an unmerited free way, then the work is no longer about you. It's about the work, the music's about the music, it's about the listeners, it's about  God, it's just the way of serving people, and ironically it becomes so much better. And this is true not just for musicians, but for all of us. And what culture he is saying is, if you experience a love supreme, then instead of using  the claim of others to fill up your own emptiness, you can minister to others out of your fullness. Nunk demitus, what an amazing approach to work.

You know, Ephesians chapter 2 verse 10, here's my translation, we are God's artwork created  by God to do good works, which God has prepared in advance for us to do. And when you know that you or his artwork, your art becomes a way of evangelism and service. So there's some perspectives by John Coltrane on the relationship between God and spirituality  and his music. And now, but I'm just a minister, I'm not a musician, but now we get to hear from Professor  at City College, but also a musician himself, John Patatucci. Wow.

Okay. Well, I guess I'd like to start first about having encountered Coltrane's music at a relatively early age. Actually even before I began my real spiritual journey, I was about 17 when I became very committed to Christianity. I heard Trane's music and I fell in love with it immediately. The urgency of it even before Love Supreme was always interesting in that the power and the beauty that he played with was overwhelming.

The great jazz drummer Billy Hart said it very well when he said when Coltrane played, even if he was playing at his fever pitch, most intense he could be. It sounded like he was playing a ballad. There was an outpouring of love from his horn. All the people that I know that were close to him say that he was a very kind and deep man. He's one of the few jazz musicians I've ever heard, especially in the company that he kept, he played with miles and monk, great visionaries, very intense men.

But a different thing happens when you hear Trane. Sometimes when you hear the others, they're kings of the craft, they're amazing artists. But there's a little bit of a dig me in there, if you know what I mean. When you hear Miles play, he's definitely laying out, this is me, I'm Miles, check this out. When Coltrane plays, it's amazing.

There's just this outpouring of emotion and purity that I never really experienced before. And I believe me, I'm a complete jazz fanatic. I have a lot of records. I spent my life absorbed in this music. I started very early in the music.

I started here in the music around eight years old. I'm 46. I spent a lot of years on the road playing and I've talked to a lot of people about it. The people that knew him said that going to the Vanguard was like going to church. When you walked in, there was something different.

This just wasn't a gig at a club with a quartet. No, this was Coltrane's band, and I'm getting kind of emotional. I wish I had been there. The other thing about it was that the way he was with the people that he was with, I've spent some time with Wayne Shorter  and many people that were around him. And he was very generous.

In fact, it was him who recommended Wayne Shorter to Miles Davis. He said, there's a guy out there. He's better than me. You should hire him. Of course, Wayne was, as anybody would be, would be incredibly humbled and devastated by that comment.

How would you like to have to follow Coltrane in a band with Miles? But that was the type of person he won. He actually lived the life of someone who was trying to be a holy person. He was a great example of it. And you can hear it whenever he plays.

His music is gripping. It's always deep. There's never extraneous things to it, whether he's playing a million notes or just one note. He grabs you and shakes you at your core of your soul. And that, to me, because of the way I believe, is the hand of God.

When I hear him play, it's not just the person playing. It's the voice of God screaming out that horn. I have to say that in listening to music, I've never heard the awesome power of the creators so manifest in an individual ever. I think you'd be hard-pressed to find that kind of depth. Many places else.

I don't know if it exists. Certainly in jazz, I don't know about that. I just know that listening to him, the impact he had on me. And also, he was tireless in pursuing the development of his gift. He didn't squander his gift.

He was given an amazing gift, but he worked harder than anybody. He was not an early prodigy that came out at age 18 and took the world by storm. He worked and worked and practiced and banged his head against the wall and kept going in a way that it wasn't like he was 18 years old and could do everything. No. I know guys that grew up with him in Philly asked Jimmy Heath.

He remembers him when he was developing. If you ask, I've talked to saxophone players like Benny Goulson who grew up with Train. He told me the funny story of when he and Coltrane used to play his mom. Benny Goulson's mom used to have him over the house when they played jazz sessions. You'd say, John, there was a Johnny Hodges ballad that Duke Ellington played and he would always make John.

She would make John play that every time he came over. And the story goes that they were in a big band and they were told that the gig got canceled. And then they walked around the community and saw posters up for the gig that they were fired from but was still happening. And they went home to Benny Goulson's mom and they had their heads low. And she said, what's wrong, boys?

She said, well, that job that we thought we were planning is happening and we're not on it. She said, I don't worry. One day people are going to pay a lot of money to hear you play. They fast forward about 20 years later at the Monterey Jazz Festival or the Newport Festival. And of course, Benny Goulson was playing with Art Blakey.

His tunes were all over the place. Train had his quartet and they were backstage and Train started laughing. And then he said, what's so funny? He said, remember what your mom said when we got fired? So he was a beautiful person.

I've had the good fortune to play with his son, Ravi. But even Ravi, unfortunately, was born at a time when he didn't really get to know his dad very well before John passed. So I could probably ramble all night. Maybe I should stop. But I just want to thank you for coming.

This is a very emotional experience for all of us. Brian and I on the road with Wayne a lot. We talk about Train a lot because Wayne used to practice with him. Train used to call him up and say, you're coming over today and they would sit at the piano. And one guy, Train would go to the piano and take his elbows and press down as many notes as he could grab and say, how many can you get?

And Wayne would try to run all the sounds. And then Wayne would do it for Train and Train would do it. And then they had Alice's harp books out. And they'd be practicing harp music and trying to just get more harmony. They were tireless in their pursuit of excellence.

There's a big lesson in that for all of us, spiritually, musically, artistically, life. So that's part of the reason why we're here today. Talk about those things. Now, you know, you got a musician, you got a minister. I have no idea what in the world kind of questions you're going to ask.

But we always do it and we think some of you will ask questions. But we would suggest nothing about auto repair or life on other planets. One of my open forums here, I remember some years ago, somebody asked me what I thought about life on other planets. And what I'm afraid is that John might really know about it. So I don't want you to ask anything about that.

If you got a question, you know, it's a big place here. You ought to go to one of those mics. Let's see. And we may not take a long time. We might take time.

It depends on you. Uh-huh. Go ahead. Great performance tonight. The question I have is concerning portraying the later music.

I guess 66, 67. It's a noisy, free, free style. Why don't you play any of that music tonight? But actually, I appreciate the music, but it's just a bit difficult to listen to. I wanted to get you to grab your thoughts on that period of his music.

You want my thoughts on the late period with like interstellar space and stuff like that. Okay. He's asking about late cult-trained music. Yeah. Late cult-trained music that was pretty intense and sometimes not palatable for people that aren't used to listening to jazz, perhaps.

You know, I think some of the music is very challenging to listen to because it's very dense. But there's a lot of beauty in it. Actually, I would recommend interstellar space. Because that's him and Rashid Ali, just saxophone and percussion. And there's some arrestingly beautiful music on that.

And it's also a saxophonic testament, if you will. The stuff he's doing on that record is just unbelievable. And so it's appealing in a very visceral way. It's gorgeous music. It's very beautiful, but it's also extremely powerful.

The stuff with Dolphi was, you know, that's a different kind of thing. The stuff with Pharaoh Sanders and the stuff that's very dense with a lot of people doing a lot of things. I maintain that through all that stuff, you hear his vision. Whether the other guys were always as strong as he was at it as questionable sometimes. But you know, when it comes to obviously his playing, and I believe Rashid Ali played beautifully on a lot of that stuff too.

You know, so I think with him it was all, he was a seeker. You know, he was trying to find new things. So I think all of it has value. Some of the people that tried to imitate him that I didn't always have patience for because a lot of times they just didn't have the depth of musicianship or soul that he had. They were just sort of jumping on the bandwagon, thinking that if they played free in avant-garde, they'd be like train.

Sure. But yeah, I think there's a lot in there to check out. But I would recommend interstellar space. Keep those kinds of questions coming. I mean, the questions they go to him.

Go ahead. I don't know either which of you will want to answer this question. But you talked about him being a seeker, and I was curious because I've been reading a little bit more about him in the last week and trying to understand more about his spirituality. And I was wondering what you make of his continued searching beyond Christianity after that period in 1957, particularly toward the latter period of his life. I mean, it seems like that was even connected to some of the music perhaps that he was just talking about.

You know, he kept looking into a lot of different things. I know he spent a lot of time with Eastern philosophies. I really don't, I don't know because I never had a chance to talk to him about it. And boy, I would have loved to just spend five minutes with him. But I didn't get to.

You know, you'd probably have to ask his family really about the depth of that. And even that, even his children probably couldn't answer you more, more Alice, if you could ask her. But yeah, he did continue to study a lot of different things. And it's. Let me, I could just add something.

The insights that I think we can, I believe, and I try to bring out for you tonight had to do with his insights about the importance of God for spirituality, for music in general. I don't know, I don't think anybody could know where he would have ended up because he was continuing to look at other religions. You know, my, my hero, my, my ministry hero, CS Lewis, who also though was a very ardent Christian also believed probably there was more grace and insight in other religions than some Christians would like to believe. And the basic insights of John Coltrane though of the relationship between God and music and spirituality remain intact regardless of that. But yeah, absolutely.

He was on an exploration. Unfortunately, I think he died before he figured out some of those things. Let's, we got to go back and forth over here. Thanks for the performance was fantastic. Another question I actually for both of you.

And what I know of John Coltrane's music in life, he was an incredibly intense man. That in between sets, he would go and practice with other musicians but just hang out in some ways his music changed so much because he was constantly practicing and dedicated to music. And I guess I have a question regarding music and art as a form and how Christians relate to that. Particularly, when you dedicate so much of your life and so much intensity to music, to what degree does that can the music become something you worship in itself. And, and it sounds like from what I've heard you say, Coltrane moved past that to actually using the music as a form of worship being God or expression of his worship to God.

And I'm not sure exactly where that balance is if you spend every waking hour of your whole life practicing to be able to produce something and this could go for any art form, then is that an idol in your life or is that a remarkable dedication that shows your worship to God? That's a great question. He's saying, when does your dedication to your art, whether it's music, any kind of art, your practice of it, when does it kind of, when does the line blur and it become idols? An idol to you that you worship. This is a thing that we all struggle with.

I believe if you're honest with yourself and you're passionate about music and your life, you have to deal with this issue. I can't speak for Trane how he dealt with it, I don't know. I know that he was known to be a serious practitioner. He did, he would play his solo, leave the mic, walk in the kitchen at the van garden, keep practicing while McCoy played his solo. He was constantly practicing.

Whenever he came to the front door at the house, I know people that visited him. He would always have the strap around his, the next strap of the saxophone around his neck. So I don't know, I also know that he did, he was around his family a lot as well too. It's difficult to say I wasn't there. I know for me it's a big challenge, I have a wife and I have two daughters.

It's a big thing, you have to make time for your family, you have to make time. In my case, because I'm a believer, I have to make time to spend with the Lord. I need to have quiet time, I need time for study. I'm a theology student, I love to study and read, I read a lot of books. I wish I could say that I knew the perfect balance and that I never went over that line.

But I honestly can't say that, I'd say that I struggle with it too. Luckily I have an amazing wife who is able to gracefully tug my co-tail to it when I need somebody to do that. And sort of help me to keep a broader view of my life and not get swallowed up by that fiddle over there or the electric pay so the piano or composing or whatever else. I can say this though, you got to be careful with that too. Some people say, well you know, when you're doing music, it can be an idol and it's going to get in the way of the Lord.

Well, actually some of the times I felt closest to the Lord when I was holding that thing in my hands and playing, feeling his presence, feeling that I was finally getting out of the way in my life for an hour or two. Or I have to say sometimes when I don't have it in my hands, I grasp for the wheel sometimes. So sometimes the converse can be true. Also it can be a time when God uses music to say, you know what? Step aside, let me work.

So it's both. I think you struggle with it and then sometimes he extends his mercy and he helps you to grow even while you're pursuing your music. No, that's a beautiful, that's perfectly balanced remarks from John. Actually the only thing I could say is that this isn't just a problem with music. I have a great marriage and I've been very, very intrigued by letters of John Newton, the guy who wrote amazing grace.

He had a great marriage and he said he always struggled with making his wife into an idol. Do you have a lousy marriage? That's an affliction. That's a problem. That's a great spiritual challenge.

If you have a great marriage, that's an affliction. That's a huge spiritual challenge because you're always going over into making what your wife says and in your wife's love more important than God's love. So actually this isn't a problem just with music. I just want you all to know. And Saren Kerkegard said that the essence of sin is building our identity on anything but God.

So the essence of sin is not so much doing bad things but it's making good things into ultimate things. And anybody who's really good at music or preaching or marriage is always just sort of falling off always sort of getting your feet wet into idolatry and having to come back. I think that's the way it is with just virtually everybody but that's the place where you have to live your life. That's the tension place that you have to live. It's estimated that most of us spend half of our waking hours at work.

How does the wisdom of the Bible apply to our careers? In other words, how can our work connect with God's work and how can our vocations be more  emotional? In his book, Every Good and Devar Tim Keller draws from decades of teaching on vocation and calling to show you how to find true joy in your work as you serve God and others. The book offers surprising insights into how a Christian perspective on work can serve as the foundation for a thriving career and a balanced personal life. Every Good and Devar is our thank you for your gift to help gospel and life share Christ's love with more people around the world.

Just visit gospel and life dot com slash give. That's gospel and life dot com slash give. Okay, let's go back over here at the right. You talked about how John Coltrane how a lot of his music was like an overflow of his spirituality. And I was curious like as a Christian and as an artist, how do you deal with times when you're not feeling the presence of God or when you don't?

Yeah, you're just not feeling it. And I guess with that, I guess as a Christian and as an artist, you need discipline. So how do you keep discipline from becoming like legalism or just like drudgery? I'm sorry, that last part, I like how do you keep like legalism? I'm discipline from like becoming like a sort of legalism or a drudgery about about like with music and with practicing.

Okay, there's something that I always tell my students and I think it's a real big truism. And first of all, you know, I spend a lot of my life traveling around with Wayne Shorters group. And Brian, the drummer you heard tonight, who's like a right arm left. I mean, he's really close. I can tell you what happens when I feel like I'm entering like if I'm, you know, we show up at a concert, we took two flights, we took a car, we're fried.

We get to the place. The only way to combat that thing of where it becomes drudgery or you're tired and you have your dry, whether you're dry spiritually or whether your spiritual dryness becomes musical dryness or whether you just feel uninspired. The way out of it is to get outside yourself quit looking all the way inner and just open your eyes and look around you. There are other people right there with you and somebody is going to do something inspiring. Somebody's going to play something that makes you think differently if you're just open to it.

And all of a sudden, you're often running and where you were fried and you couldn't think of anything to play 30 seconds ago, somebody plays something and boom, you're off. If you're open to it, see when we get all like, oh, no, I got to do this or what about that shift or what about this chords? If we get wrapped up in that, it's just like a lead weight and just we go sinking down. But if we, if we look outside of ourselves, it's amazing what can happen. And that's a metaphor for your life too.

Your spiritual life too. God is always that metaphor of looking up and receiving from Him instead of trying to have your hands on the wheel and do it all yourself. And generate it all yourself and your works and this and that. If you just do this and this, it's going to be great. So that's getting outside of that kind of tunnel vision, that insular thing which makes you just sort of cave in on yourself.

Over here. On the directions and music tour about five years ago, I saw you play with, I wanted to ask Brian this too, but I saw you play with Brecker and Hargrove and Herbie Hancock and stuff. And right before Michael Brecker played Naima, he gave like a two or three minute talk on his, when he got his first Coltrane album, his first Coltrane record. And he described like, he always, I forget who was listening to it at the time, he was like 13 or something, but he went into a lot of depth about how when he listened to it, it didn't make sense. But then it ended up sounded like, I know the words he's were like emotional and intelligent.

And I was, I was hoping you were going to explain this earlier, you started to go into a little bit how when you were a nine or ten, but what was your first experience with hearing Coltrane and did it, did it stick right away or was it like, what's this dude doing all these scales or like, how did it, how did it make sense to you? Because to a lot of people, Coltrane doesn't make sense when the first team, I'm a jazz pianist. But the first time I heard Coltrane, I was like, okay, this is a lot of notes, I'll listen to Witten Kelley or whatever. But, you know, but it grows on you, you know, I'm just wondering like, what was your first experience with him? Like, were you exposed to him through another musician?

Did you accidentally buy it, thinking it was something else? Trying to remember what the first record was, and it might have been, let's see, it might have been giant steps, which had Equinox on it also was an Atlantic record. I have to say that the emotion of it always grabbed me, even before I understood harmonically and rhythmically what he was doing. He went right through me immediately. Same with Wayne, when I heard Wayne's first music, I was about eight, I heard children of the night on the mosaic, our Blakey record.

I didn't understand what they were doing, but there was this searing quality, the saxophone, there was just this soulful cry that went boom right inside. Train was like that with me, the record with giant steps, even though that's a highly, that was again one of his manifestos harmonically. He laid this thing out that he'd been working on. Just, it's like Billy Hart said, whether he was playing one note or 30 million notes, it always sounds like he's playing a ballad. There's all this beauty and spiritual force coming through.

So even before I could understand it, and giant steps is a good example, Equinox is on that record which is slower also and very blues. I could always hear the, you know, his grandfather was a preacher, and that cadence is always in his playing too. That kind of vocal speech-like thing, and the tenor saxophone's very close to the human voice. So that always grabbed me, even though I didn't know what they were doing. So that was, it kind of grabbed me young.

Over here. This question sort of touches on everything that's a few questions I'd been asked before about a cult trains, a phenomenal commitment to practicing anecdotes about him playing a seed major scale for 11 hours straight. Just one of the curious as to how you think that informs his attitude on work versus faith, on the sheer aesthetic discipline of his practice regimen versus his commitment to spirituality later on in life. Wow. Did everybody hear that?

The question about how he pursued his art with practicing, practicing how that affected his art, whether his aesthetic, you know, musical aestheticism. What affected that have, was it a works mentality by practicing like this, this is you'll get good? You know, I have to say that when you redefine your instrument and you become a great virtuoso like trained did, I think he needed that to express the depth of his spiritual feelings that he had. I joke with my students, I hate when students say, I play what I feel, you know, I don't need to learn all this stuff. So yeah, when you have all those feelings and you're so frustrated because you can't get it out your hands.

Classical example, some people try to elevate naivete in music and sometimes even incompetence to like they worship that. Like if you know too much, well, then you can't be good. You can't play with feeling if you know too much. Coltrane shatters that to bits. There's no one more soulful on the planet that ever walked the planet and there's no one who knew that much on his instrument.

So it kind of blows away the works thing. In other words, he had to have all those that flexibility to say what it needed to say. And it never, to me, it never got out of proportion. It was misused. It was never technique for technique sake.

It was technique in the service of a masterful soulful expression of music that, you know, still saxophone players are trying to figure out what he did. It's been gone a long time. 40 years. Ask Mike Brecker and all these guys who are the pagan emis of today and they'll tell you that train is still their hero. The only thing I could add, it's amazing how many residences there are with everything else besides music. But in the beginning, I think almost anybody in a career in the very beginning, you are, it is a kind of works righteousness.

You're working hard because you want to be accepted. But you often see with people who get the acceptance they want. They get successful and they still go on. And I think it's because they realize at a certain point now I've got a vision. I want to get it out.

And obviously, my concern is more rhetoric and narrative. And I'm always frustrated now because I know what I want to say but I never feel like I quite get there to say it. In the earlier days of being a preacher, I worked by crazy because I wanted people to accept me. Now I'm accepted. I really want to say certain things that I can't do unless I work by crazy to do it.

I think John's absolutely right. There are some people that need to prove yourself, never goes away. And you can hear it in some musicians. It's always about me. Our little talks tonight said that somewhere, Coltrane because of his spiritual awakening, blew past that.

And it wasn't about him anymore. It wasn't works righteousness. Now he had a vision and he had a mission. And he just wanted to do it as well as he could. And that's what we all should be after.

And in fact, Miles used to say, why are you playing so long? Don't you ever take the horn out of your mouth? And Trane was so beautiful. He wasn't salty back or anything. I'm just trying to get to this thing and I got to get there.

And he was very humble. He felt like I can't quite get it. It's taken me that long. When I play one of my soul, it takes me a while. I'm trying to find this thing.

Meanwhile, the rest of us would love to be trying to find something like Trane. I wish I could try to find something like that too. Because his supposed searching and scuffling was 80 million times better than the rest of us could even imagine or dream. Good. Let's keep going back forth over here.

I know that there's a lot of deep emotional and spiritual music today. But I feel if you could reflect on the change in our mainstream attitude toward music,  I always feel like I'm looking back and capturing something greater than today. But I know it's there. We heard it tonight. It was amazing.

I just personally wish it was more of it. And maybe you have thoughts on your growth up position. Wow. So basically you're saying sometimes it just feels like there was a lot of deeper connection in the music back. When we listen to old records and we hear this purity that attracts us because it has nothing to do with marketing and Wall Street and lawyers negotiating contracts, frankly.

Yeah, I live in this world. We all do. And that's something that Brian and I talk a lot about. That's what Wayne Shorter. We all talk about this a lot.

We feel like we have a mission. We feel like we're swimming up stream a lot of times. But nonetheless, we feel compelled to continue. Sometimes it takes courage because the record companies, even with Wayne's group, frankly, they sometimes seem to value, but not much value on what we're doing. They're trying to chase the newest flavor of the month.

If they can get a pop singer and sell millions of records. Hey, that's where their priority is. So you can't let it get you bitter. You have to continue on your mission. You have to be disciplined.

Because if you let it, it'll stop you. And for me, there's an added thing about I feel like God has given me something important that I need to keep pursuing. Whether it's popular with the business folks or not. I really can't think about that. Yeah, I have to provide for my family, which I work hard to do.

But when it comes to my art and the music that I write and I play and the records that I make for myself, I feel of responsibility. To God to people, I must do the utmost thing I can do. The most I can use, whatever I have, to make the most honest music that I can, to reach out to people in an honest way, instead of trying to be something that's the flavor of the month this year, which changes every month. That's why somebody like Wayne shorter is so important. He never gave in.

He never stopped. And that's why train loved him also around. Thanks. Hi, and you earlier talk, you mentioned that one of the things that defines us is our work. And certainly I feel like it's taken a lot of my time.

Maybe it's because I'm not really a musician. I feel that sometimes my work takes me away from my spiritual side. So maybe you could give a guidance of sharing experience. How when times it's a you feel not disconnected with yourself. How you come back to present.

How do you come back to your spiritual side? Yes, I'll be brief. There's a sense in which there's a micro meaning and a macro meaning. The micro meaning, I think, your micro identity. That is, who are you?

Micro identity is, you look at your gifts, you look at what you're good at, and you do it. And there's that great place in the chair. It's a fire where Eric Little says, God made me fast. And when I run, I feel this pleasure. So if you're fast, you run.

If you're an artist, you do art and so forth. If you make great business deals, make great business deals. When you use your gifts that you've been given, you feel like you fit in the universe. That's what that line in the movie means. And from a Christian point of view, we think your gifts and talents aren't accidents.

They didn't happen just accidentally. It's what God wants you to be. That's your micro meaning. If you don't have the macro meaning, and the macro meaning is that you're a child of God, and that you have a relationship with him, and when I use the word child, this is a Christian understanding of this, a child of God. I have children.

And if one of my children does well, I'm very proud of them, and my heart goes out toward them. If one of my children does horribly and does everything wrong, I'm more engaged with them. In other words, being a father means I love my kids. And whether they're doing well or not doing well, whatever they do draws my heart out toward them. To be a child of God means I know that I'm in His grace, I've experienced His grace.

He loves me unconditionally. Knowing that is your macro meaning. If you don't have the macro meaning, then your micro meaning becomes the macro meaning. And that's really what the sickness on the death by Curegard is. When your work and your gifts become your whole meaning, then somehow you'll find, just like Tolkien felt, because he could never really write the book he wants, just like Tim Keller feels he could never really preach the ceremony once.

John Patatucci never can quite get out what he wants to get out. If that's the whole of your life, then you're always unhappy. You always feel like I'm falling short, I'm not doing what I want to do. So you've got to put your gift and your mission and your art and your work in a diamond in a bigger setting, and it's got to be a setting of knowing I'm a child of God. Without that, then the work becomes the idol and it drives you to the ground.

So I think there has to be a balance between the two things. And that's what makes people bitter too, I think. People are struggling and they can only see right in front of them. And they keep reaching for that thing and they can't quite get it. If that's all there is, then it's pretty rough existence being an artist.

Unless you have that hope. Now, even though I'm going back and forth, I think these folks have been waiting longer, so go ahead. Hi, I'm a mother of two jazz musicians, one who plays and the other promotes, and I also minister and I'm often going home on the train about three or four in the morning. And I see the passion in both of you, and I also find it in the musicians, including my sons, with whom I minister. And they're great spirits, but what I'm asking both of you is, I heard one of them say to me, we don't come to you and you don't come to us in terms of reaching out as Christians, as believers.

And I'm asking for ways because what I'd love to do is bring Brian to you and say, Brian, I want you to know a musician who believes in Jesus Christ. Is that your son's name, Brian? Oh, okay. And Andrew too. Yeah.

Well, bring him. And bring him on. Okay. I will. Yeah.

I've got tears in my eyes and I thank you all so much. Yeah. It just means so much. And there are so many people out there who need hope and future. And God has blessed me to do what I love doing and to reach out and this just inspires me so.

Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Go ahead.

Thanks. I have a question, but it doesn't have anything to do with music. Oh, no. Wait a minute. I don't know everything about everything else, but music.

Say I want to, I want to measure in science, and I want to be a teacher, but, and I believe in God. But part of that has to do with evolution. What if I don't believe in evolution, but I teach it. Have you deal with that? Fortunately, I can be real, real brief about this.

Your belief of evolution does not matter to your acceptance of the, you know, Orthodox teaches a Christianity. People who believe in the most orthodox faith have different views on evolution. So you cannot, it's a red herring to think that a particular view of evolution fits in with, say, Orthodox Christianity. If I don't have it, I can't be an Orthodox Christian. It's not true.

Now, I'm not going to go any further than that, but the point is that people have got all sorts of views on evolution across the spectrum, and, therefore, I always say to people,  figure out what you, you know, if Jesus is the son of God, resurrected from the dead, figure that out. That makes every difference. If that's the case, then you have to live like this. If it doesn't, then you don't have to live like this. You can live like this.

That's what matters. Don't even worry about the evolution thing. Get to that later. And I have very strong Christian friends that have virtually every view possible about evolution. So don't let it distract you.

Okay. Over here. Yes. I was just curious to hear some thoughts of yours about maybe some of John Coltrane's later work as a soloist versus some of his earlier works. Like, for instance, everything after interstellar space versus everything before.

Like I was thinking that when I listen to giant steps or interstellar space or anything from around that period, I hear, you know, his new concepts and his advanced new styles of playing more fully developed than when I listen to his some of his later work. And I always kind of wondered if that was maybe running parallel to what was going on in his spiritual life at the same time this surgeon. I don't know how to describe that because that's a very personal thing that he was doing. You know, I remember sometimes feeling like, well, you know, I have my favorites. I have many favorite periods of train and sometimes the absolute latest.

You know, I just, just when I thought that maybe, you know, I had heard some of the later stuff and I didn't like it as much as the earliest. Then I heard a track one time of him playing alto. It was very late Coltrane that destroyed me. It was unbelievable. It was with Alice Coltrane and him.

I don't know who maybe Rashid. I don't even know what record it was. I just think you have to dig around and you have to listen to it. You can't just listen to it once or twice and go, well, you know, I like giant steps better because there's a lot of stuff. You have to be patient.

But yeah, I can't speak for him because he was really on this amazing path and search that I can't say what he was thinking. And I really sometimes I have to go back. You know, I have a lot of Coltrane records a ton. But, you know, I go through periods where I listen a lot and then I move away from it for a while and then I come back. And the really late stuff is not what I often go to first when I come back to listen to him.

Do you mind if I follow? I was just wondering though, do you hear like the same levels of organization and where he was going technically or? I think whenever he played his horn throughout his entire life, there's always a genius level of organizational stuff happening. There's never a record you can point to where it's not. It's just overwhelming.

We've gone 30 minutes and some of you are voting that this time should be about up. I think because you've been waiting, I'll take one more question and I'm afraid this is going to be it everybody. Sorry, go ahead. Over here. Okay, this is an interesting question you might not expect.

Actually, when you guys were talking about music, I didn't get it. So, my question is, is there hope for someone that don't actually understand jazz? Like how about a three minute version of jazz for dummies? Here it is. I've got one for you.

People say I don't understand jazz. Okay, I always come back with, do you understand Beethoven or Mozart? Can you comprehend their genius yet? You can listen to the music and go, wow, you don't feel the need to try to understand it, do you? You just listen to it and go, wow, that's what jazz is like.

If you listen to culture and you don't have to understand what he's doing,  but you can just listen to the emotional part of it and you can either receive it and you don't have to receive it. I don't have emotions from it. You don't. Oh, okay. People cry when they hear some things and I don't get it.

Some people don't get computers, I don't get jazz. That's okay. That's really okay. I can't sit here and tell you that jazz is for every soul. So you actually could listen to the music that he wrote and say,  wow, he was really inspired by God.

He was really excited at this point and that point, really? Totally. Totally. Awesome. It's nice.

Well, but. Good for you. You know what it is? Yeah, and it's okay if you don't. I mean, for me, it was something that gripped me and it makes me cry when I hear him play.

That's great. Yeah, it's the same, by the way. My hero, CS Lewis says that there's a thread. There's a secret thread that every individual has a kind of unique thread of things  that move you. Music, literature, a landscape, a particular person, a spot on the earth.

That, and I was talking before about how Coltrane says,  there's also a great Leonard Bernstein quote that I was used. Bernstein said, when he hears Beethoven's fifth, even though he's an atheist,  he's basically, I have to believe in God. Now, everybody's got a little thread of what those things are. And some people's thread don't go through jazz, okay? But the point is that it doesn't determine isolation, so that's good.

Otherwise, I won't be in heaven with you, you know? Everybody's got a thread. Everybody's got a thread. And by the way, in my case, for example, I was a trumpet player. As tries, I couldn't do jazz.

I just couldn't do it. As a result, I just couldn't, even though at one point I was pretty good. I just couldn't do it. And in my case, it's sort of like, I look at these guys who can do it  with a certain kind of awe because I tried. I appreciate jazz quite a bit, but probably appreciate it a little differently  because I'm a failed jazz musician.

And therefore, I actually have a certain awe that you don't have. The real point is everybody's got that thread. For some people, it goes right to the down the center of jazz. For some people, it's mainly jazz. For some people, it's hardly at all.

With my wife, it's pretty much hardly at all. But on the other hand, her thread goes right to downtown Ballet. And I say, hmm. All right. Yeah.

So anyway, but everybody's got a thread. And that's the thing we've been talking about tonight. Listen, this guy is so well spoken. And a lot of you hear me a lot. But boy, this has been terrific to have John here tonight.

So let's give my hand for being here. Thank you. Thanks for coming.

### English Transcript (for reference)

Today, on Gospel and Life, Tim Keller shows us that the Bible has incredibly helpful  and practical wisdom we can apply to the work we do. Wisdom you may find surprising, even life-changing. I want to talk about two quotes, two things that John Coltrane said about the relationship  between God and His music. And I think each of them tells us something very significant. The first one tells us something about the relationship of music and art to God.

And the second one talks about our relationship of our work in general to God. Another way to put it is this. Coltrane's first quote points to music as evangelism. The second quote points to music as service. Now, when I use the word evangelism, I hope for a moment you can sort of shake free your  mind from any association that word with politics, fundamentalism, and remember that evangelism  means good news of hope.

Here's the first quote. John Coltrane says overall, I think the main thing a musician would like to do is give  a picture to the listener of the many wonderful things that he knows and senses in the universe. That's what I would like to do. I think that's one of the greatest things you can do in life, and we all try to do it in  some way. The musician is through his music.

Now, what Coltrane is saying is that music, not just the words to a song, but the music  itself is a form of evangelism. Music can tell the most hopeless heart that there's hope, the most meaningless heart that  there's meaning. No matter what you believe with your head, music tells you that your life is not a tale  told by an idiot, full of sounded fury, signifying nothing. Music has a way of coming to you and saying in spite of how you feel, there is hope, there  is meaning. Stephen J.

Gould, the late Harvard paleontologist, wrote this, he says, we are here simply because  one odd group of fish had a peculiar anatomy that just happened to be able to transform into  legs for terrestrial creatures. We are here simply because common struck the earth at a particular time and wiped out  dinosaurs giving mammals a chance. We yearn for a higher answer, but none exists. We are not here for any purpose at all. We have to construct any meaning to our lives ourselves.

Now, what he's simply saying is this, we yearn to believe that we're here for purpose  that there is meaning in life, that there is hope. But if there is no God, there's none. There isn't any. You can tell yourself that there is, but there really isn't. You can yearn for a higher answer, but there isn't.

But Ashley Kahn, a person with Stephen J. Gould's exact same beliefs about the universe,  wrote a book called A Love Supreme, the story of John Coltrane's signature album. And in it, he says this, as I listened to the album again and again, I felt impelled  to address Coltrane's impassioned spirituality, though I consider myself a dedicated  agnostic and diehard rationalist. I am ready to admit that there is much that can seem to be the handiwork of some eternal  force under spiritual direction. Very begrudgingly, and by the way, John told me he knows this guy, knows Ashley Kahn, very  begrudgingly, here's what Kahn says.

I have the same view of the universe that Stephen J. Gould has. As far as I know, I'm a hard-nosed rationalist, we're not here for any purpose, we're not here. We weren't created. We're just here by accident.

There is no meaning in life. There is no such thing as significance. But when he hears the music, his heart tells him something different. When he hears the music, he can't not know. He can't not know that there is a love that lasts forever, that there's truth, that there's  meaning.

The music evangelizes him. His head tells him these things don't exist. God doesn't exist. But his heart knows better, and the music reminds his heart of that, and the music confirms  it. And actually, those of you who are artists in any form, art has the power to do that.

And if you are an artist, whether you know it or not, you are using that power, but how  much more fulfilling your life would be if you knew what you're doing. So first of all, I think the first thing that Coltrane shows us is that connection, spiritual  connection between art and great music, especially, and how great music evangelized, secondly, though,  Coltrane actually points to music as service, and this actually applies, not just to musicians  and artists, but to us all. He says, in the liner notes of a love supreme, he says, during the year 1957, I experienced  by the grace of God a spiritual awakening which was to lead me to a richer, fuller, more  productive life. At that time, in gratitude, I humbly asked to be given the means and privilege to make  others happy through music, to inspire them to realize more and more of their capacities  for living meaningful lives. Because there certainly is meaning to life, and I feel this has been granted to me through  his grace, all praise to God.

Now, actually, you have both of the themes in that quote, but I want to point out what  he says about his now-his-work in service. Stephen J. Gold was right when he said, if you think life is meaningless, what am I who  you are? You've got to create a meaning for yourself. And one of the ways most of us, especially in a place like New York, one of the ways  most of us find a way to make sure where you know we're significant is through our work.

It's through our work by doing it well, and by moving ourselves ahead, through our work,  we say, now I know I have significance. In other words, we take our work and we make that as we make it all about us. You see, if the way in which you know you've got meaning in life and the way in which  you know you've got significance in worth is your music. Then the music, ironically, is about you. And the paradox is, when the music's about you, it's not usually very good music.

You know, there's a place where CS Lewis, who was an artist, said, the artist who's trying  desperately to be original will never be original. The artist who's trying desperately to make a good impression is not going to make a  very good impression. If you use your work as a desperate search, a desperate effort to give yourself meaning  in life, ironically you won't do a very good job with your work, but culture and something  happened to change culture and changed all that for him, that one night he played his  piece of love supreme, you know, 32-minute piece outpouring of praise and thanks. And he did an incredible night, and he stepped down, and he was heard to say when he was  done, none could admit us. Now those are the first two words in the Latin, first two Latin words of something that  Simeon said in Luke chapter 2 when he'd seen the baby Jesus, and he realized he'd seen  the Messiah.

Simeon says, now let thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word from my eyes  have seen my salvation. And what culture he was actually saying is, I've done it. I've done everything I was put here on the earth to do. I'm ready to go if I have to. Now where does it get that contentment?

If you have experienced a supreme love so that you know he loves you, regardless of how  well you do out there on the stage, regardless of how well it claimed you are in your work,  if you know he loves you in an unmerited free way, then the work is no longer about you. It's about the work, the music's about the music, it's about the listeners, it's about  God, it's just the way of serving people, and ironically it becomes so much better. And this is true not just for musicians, but for all of us. And what culture he is saying is, if you experience a love supreme, then instead of using  the claim of others to fill up your own emptiness, you can minister to others out of your fullness. Nunk demitus, what an amazing approach to work.

You know, Ephesians chapter 2 verse 10, here's my translation, we are God's artwork created  by God to do good works, which God has prepared in advance for us to do. And when you know that you or his artwork, your art becomes a way of evangelism and service. So there's some perspectives by John Coltrane on the relationship between God and spirituality  and his music. And now, but I'm just a minister, I'm not a musician, but now we get to hear from Professor  at City College, but also a musician himself, John Patatucci. Wow.

Okay. Well, I guess I'd like to start first about having encountered Coltrane's music at a relatively early age. Actually even before I began my real spiritual journey, I was about 17 when I became very committed to Christianity. I heard Trane's music and I fell in love with it immediately. The urgency of it even before Love Supreme was always interesting in that the power and the beauty that he played with was overwhelming.

The great jazz drummer Billy Hart said it very well when he said when Coltrane played, even if he was playing at his fever pitch, most intense he could be. It sounded like he was playing a ballad. There was an outpouring of love from his horn. All the people that I know that were close to him say that he was a very kind and deep man. He's one of the few jazz musicians I've ever heard, especially in the company that he kept, he played with miles and monk, great visionaries, very intense men.

But a different thing happens when you hear Trane. Sometimes when you hear the others, they're kings of the craft, they're amazing artists. But there's a little bit of a dig me in there, if you know what I mean. When you hear Miles play, he's definitely laying out, this is me, I'm Miles, check this out. When Coltrane plays, it's amazing.

There's just this outpouring of emotion and purity that I never really experienced before. And I believe me, I'm a complete jazz fanatic. I have a lot of records. I spent my life absorbed in this music. I started very early in the music.

I started here in the music around eight years old. I'm 46. I spent a lot of years on the road playing and I've talked to a lot of people about it. The people that knew him said that going to the Vanguard was like going to church. When you walked in, there was something different.

This just wasn't a gig at a club with a quartet. No, this was Coltrane's band, and I'm getting kind of emotional. I wish I had been there. The other thing about it was that the way he was with the people that he was with, I've spent some time with Wayne Shorter  and many people that were around him. And he was very generous.

In fact, it was him who recommended Wayne Shorter to Miles Davis. He said, there's a guy out there. He's better than me. You should hire him. Of course, Wayne was, as anybody would be, would be incredibly humbled and devastated by that comment.

How would you like to have to follow Coltrane in a band with Miles? But that was the type of person he won. He actually lived the life of someone who was trying to be a holy person. He was a great example of it. And you can hear it whenever he plays.

His music is gripping. It's always deep. There's never extraneous things to it, whether he's playing a million notes or just one note. He grabs you and shakes you at your core of your soul. And that, to me, because of the way I believe, is the hand of God.

When I hear him play, it's not just the person playing. It's the voice of God screaming out that horn. I have to say that in listening to music, I've never heard the awesome power of the creators so manifest in an individual ever. I think you'd be hard-pressed to find that kind of depth. Many places else.

I don't know if it exists. Certainly in jazz, I don't know about that. I just know that listening to him, the impact he had on me. And also, he was tireless in pursuing the development of his gift. He didn't squander his gift.

He was given an amazing gift, but he worked harder than anybody. He was not an early prodigy that came out at age 18 and took the world by storm. He worked and worked and practiced and banged his head against the wall and kept going in a way that it wasn't like he was 18 years old and could do everything. No. I know guys that grew up with him in Philly asked Jimmy Heath.

He remembers him when he was developing. If you ask, I've talked to saxophone players like Benny Goulson who grew up with Train. He told me the funny story of when he and Coltrane used to play his mom. Benny Goulson's mom used to have him over the house when they played jazz sessions. You'd say, John, there was a Johnny Hodges ballad that Duke Ellington played and he would always make John.

She would make John play that every time he came over. And the story goes that they were in a big band and they were told that the gig got canceled. And then they walked around the community and saw posters up for the gig that they were fired from but was still happening. And they went home to Benny Goulson's mom and they had their heads low. And she said, what's wrong, boys?

She said, well, that job that we thought we were planning is happening and we're not on it. She said, I don't worry. One day people are going to pay a lot of money to hear you play. They fast forward about 20 years later at the Monterey Jazz Festival or the Newport Festival. And of course, Benny Goulson was playing with Art Blakey.

His tunes were all over the place. Train had his quartet and they were backstage and Train started laughing. And then he said, what's so funny? He said, remember what your mom said when we got fired? So he was a beautiful person.

I've had the good fortune to play with his son, Ravi. But even Ravi, unfortunately, was born at a time when he didn't really get to know his dad very well before John passed. So I could probably ramble all night. Maybe I should stop. But I just want to thank you for coming.

This is a very emotional experience for all of us. Brian and I on the road with Wayne a lot. We talk about Train a lot because Wayne used to practice with him. Train used to call him up and say, you're coming over today and they would sit at the piano. And one guy, Train would go to the piano and take his elbows and press down as many notes as he could grab and say, how many can you get?

And Wayne would try to run all the sounds. And then Wayne would do it for Train and Train would do it. And then they had Alice's harp books out. And they'd be practicing harp music and trying to just get more harmony. They were tireless in their pursuit of excellence.

There's a big lesson in that for all of us, spiritually, musically, artistically, life. So that's part of the reason why we're here today. Talk about those things. Now, you know, you got a musician, you got a minister. I have no idea what in the world kind of questions you're going to ask.

But we always do it and we think some of you will ask questions. But we would suggest nothing about auto repair or life on other planets. One of my open forums here, I remember some years ago, somebody asked me what I thought about life on other planets. And what I'm afraid is that John might really know about it. So I don't want you to ask anything about that.

If you got a question, you know, it's a big place here. You ought to go to one of those mics. Let's see. And we may not take a long time. We might take time.

It depends on you. Uh-huh. Go ahead. Great performance tonight. The question I have is concerning portraying the later music.

I guess 66, 67. It's a noisy, free, free style. Why don't you play any of that music tonight? But actually, I appreciate the music, but it's just a bit difficult to listen to. I wanted to get you to grab your thoughts on that period of his music.

You want my thoughts on the late period with like interstellar space and stuff like that. Okay. He's asking about late cult-trained music. Yeah. Late cult-trained music that was pretty intense and sometimes not palatable for people that aren't used to listening to jazz, perhaps.

You know, I think some of the music is very challenging to listen to because it's very dense. But there's a lot of beauty in it. Actually, I would recommend interstellar space. Because that's him and Rashid Ali, just saxophone and percussion. And there's some arrestingly beautiful music on that.

And it's also a saxophonic testament, if you will. The stuff he's doing on that record is just unbelievable. And so it's appealing in a very visceral way. It's gorgeous music. It's very beautiful, but it's also extremely powerful.

The stuff with Dolphi was, you know, that's a different kind of thing. The stuff with Pharaoh Sanders and the stuff that's very dense with a lot of people doing a lot of things. I maintain that through all that stuff, you hear his vision. Whether the other guys were always as strong as he was at it as questionable sometimes. But you know, when it comes to obviously his playing, and I believe Rashid Ali played beautifully on a lot of that stuff too.

You know, so I think with him it was all, he was a seeker. You know, he was trying to find new things. So I think all of it has value. Some of the people that tried to imitate him that I didn't always have patience for because a lot of times they just didn't have the depth of musicianship or soul that he had. They were just sort of jumping on the bandwagon, thinking that if they played free in avant-garde, they'd be like train.

Sure. But yeah, I think there's a lot in there to check out. But I would recommend interstellar space. Keep those kinds of questions coming. I mean, the questions they go to him.

Go ahead. I don't know either which of you will want to answer this question. But you talked about him being a seeker, and I was curious because I've been reading a little bit more about him in the last week and trying to understand more about his spirituality. And I was wondering what you make of his continued searching beyond Christianity after that period in 1957, particularly toward the latter period of his life. I mean, it seems like that was even connected to some of the music perhaps that he was just talking about.

You know, he kept looking into a lot of different things. I know he spent a lot of time with Eastern philosophies. I really don't, I don't know because I never had a chance to talk to him about it. And boy, I would have loved to just spend five minutes with him. But I didn't get to.

You know, you'd probably have to ask his family really about the depth of that. And even that, even his children probably couldn't answer you more, more Alice, if you could ask her. But yeah, he did continue to study a lot of different things. And it's. Let me, I could just add something.

The insights that I think we can, I believe, and I try to bring out for you tonight had to do with his insights about the importance of God for spirituality, for music in general. I don't know, I don't think anybody could know where he would have ended up because he was continuing to look at other religions. You know, my, my hero, my, my ministry hero, CS Lewis, who also though was a very ardent Christian also believed probably there was more grace and insight in other religions than some Christians would like to believe. And the basic insights of John Coltrane though of the relationship between God and music and spirituality remain intact regardless of that. But yeah, absolutely.

He was on an exploration. Unfortunately, I think he died before he figured out some of those things. Let's, we got to go back and forth over here. Thanks for the performance was fantastic. Another question I actually for both of you.

And what I know of John Coltrane's music in life, he was an incredibly intense man. That in between sets, he would go and practice with other musicians but just hang out in some ways his music changed so much because he was constantly practicing and dedicated to music. And I guess I have a question regarding music and art as a form and how Christians relate to that. Particularly, when you dedicate so much of your life and so much intensity to music, to what degree does that can the music become something you worship in itself. And, and it sounds like from what I've heard you say, Coltrane moved past that to actually using the music as a form of worship being God or expression of his worship to God.

And I'm not sure exactly where that balance is if you spend every waking hour of your whole life practicing to be able to produce something and this could go for any art form, then is that an idol in your life or is that a remarkable dedication that shows your worship to God? That's a great question. He's saying, when does your dedication to your art, whether it's music, any kind of art, your practice of it, when does it kind of, when does the line blur and it become idols? An idol to you that you worship. This is a thing that we all struggle with.

I believe if you're honest with yourself and you're passionate about music and your life, you have to deal with this issue. I can't speak for Trane how he dealt with it, I don't know. I know that he was known to be a serious practitioner. He did, he would play his solo, leave the mic, walk in the kitchen at the van garden, keep practicing while McCoy played his solo. He was constantly practicing.

Whenever he came to the front door at the house, I know people that visited him. He would always have the strap around his, the next strap of the saxophone around his neck. So I don't know, I also know that he did, he was around his family a lot as well too. It's difficult to say I wasn't there. I know for me it's a big challenge, I have a wife and I have two daughters.

It's a big thing, you have to make time for your family, you have to make time. In my case, because I'm a believer, I have to make time to spend with the Lord. I need to have quiet time, I need time for study. I'm a theology student, I love to study and read, I read a lot of books. I wish I could say that I knew the perfect balance and that I never went over that line.

But I honestly can't say that, I'd say that I struggle with it too. Luckily I have an amazing wife who is able to gracefully tug my co-tail to it when I need somebody to do that. And sort of help me to keep a broader view of my life and not get swallowed up by that fiddle over there or the electric pay so the piano or composing or whatever else. I can say this though, you got to be careful with that too. Some people say, well you know, when you're doing music, it can be an idol and it's going to get in the way of the Lord.

Well, actually some of the times I felt closest to the Lord when I was holding that thing in my hands and playing, feeling his presence, feeling that I was finally getting out of the way in my life for an hour or two. Or I have to say sometimes when I don't have it in my hands, I grasp for the wheel sometimes. So sometimes the converse can be true. Also it can be a time when God uses music to say, you know what? Step aside, let me work.

So it's both. I think you struggle with it and then sometimes he extends his mercy and he helps you to grow even while you're pursuing your music. No, that's a beautiful, that's perfectly balanced remarks from John. Actually the only thing I could say is that this isn't just a problem with music. I have a great marriage and I've been very, very intrigued by letters of John Newton, the guy who wrote amazing grace.

He had a great marriage and he said he always struggled with making his wife into an idol. Do you have a lousy marriage? That's an affliction. That's a problem. That's a great spiritual challenge.

If you have a great marriage, that's an affliction. That's a huge spiritual challenge because you're always going over into making what your wife says and in your wife's love more important than God's love. So actually this isn't a problem just with music. I just want you all to know. And Saren Kerkegard said that the essence of sin is building our identity on anything but God.

So the essence of sin is not so much doing bad things but it's making good things into ultimate things. And anybody who's really good at music or preaching or marriage is always just sort of falling off always sort of getting your feet wet into idolatry and having to come back. I think that's the way it is with just virtually everybody but that's the place where you have to live your life. That's the tension place that you have to live. It's estimated that most of us spend half of our waking hours at work.

How does the wisdom of the Bible apply to our careers? In other words, how can our work connect with God's work and how can our vocations be more  emotional? In his book, Every Good and Devar Tim Keller draws from decades of teaching on vocation and calling to show you how to find true joy in your work as you serve God and others. The book offers surprising insights into how a Christian perspective on work can serve as the foundation for a thriving career and a balanced personal life. Every Good and Devar is our thank you for your gift to help gospel and life share Christ's love with more people around the world.

Just visit gospel and life dot com slash give. That's gospel and life dot com slash give. Okay, let's go back over here at the right. You talked about how John Coltrane how a lot of his music was like an overflow of his spirituality. And I was curious like as a Christian and as an artist, how do you deal with times when you're not feeling the presence of God or when you don't?

Yeah, you're just not feeling it. And I guess with that, I guess as a Christian and as an artist, you need discipline. So how do you keep discipline from becoming like legalism or just like drudgery? I'm sorry, that last part, I like how do you keep like legalism? I'm discipline from like becoming like a sort of legalism or a drudgery about about like with music and with practicing.

Okay, there's something that I always tell my students and I think it's a real big truism. And first of all, you know, I spend a lot of my life traveling around with Wayne Shorters group. And Brian, the drummer you heard tonight, who's like a right arm left. I mean, he's really close. I can tell you what happens when I feel like I'm entering like if I'm, you know, we show up at a concert, we took two flights, we took a car, we're fried.

We get to the place. The only way to combat that thing of where it becomes drudgery or you're tired and you have your dry, whether you're dry spiritually or whether your spiritual dryness becomes musical dryness or whether you just feel uninspired. The way out of it is to get outside yourself quit looking all the way inner and just open your eyes and look around you. There are other people right there with you and somebody is going to do something inspiring. Somebody's going to play something that makes you think differently if you're just open to it.

And all of a sudden, you're often running and where you were fried and you couldn't think of anything to play 30 seconds ago, somebody plays something and boom, you're off. If you're open to it, see when we get all like, oh, no, I got to do this or what about that shift or what about this chords? If we get wrapped up in that, it's just like a lead weight and just we go sinking down. But if we, if we look outside of ourselves, it's amazing what can happen. And that's a metaphor for your life too.

Your spiritual life too. God is always that metaphor of looking up and receiving from Him instead of trying to have your hands on the wheel and do it all yourself. And generate it all yourself and your works and this and that. If you just do this and this, it's going to be great. So that's getting outside of that kind of tunnel vision, that insular thing which makes you just sort of cave in on yourself.

Over here. On the directions and music tour about five years ago, I saw you play with, I wanted to ask Brian this too, but I saw you play with Brecker and Hargrove and Herbie Hancock and stuff. And right before Michael Brecker played Naima, he gave like a two or three minute talk on his, when he got his first Coltrane album, his first Coltrane record. And he described like, he always, I forget who was listening to it at the time, he was like 13 or something, but he went into a lot of depth about how when he listened to it, it didn't make sense. But then it ended up sounded like, I know the words he's were like emotional and intelligent.

And I was, I was hoping you were going to explain this earlier, you started to go into a little bit how when you were a nine or ten, but what was your first experience with hearing Coltrane and did it, did it stick right away or was it like, what's this dude doing all these scales or like, how did it, how did it make sense to you? Because to a lot of people, Coltrane doesn't make sense when the first team, I'm a jazz pianist. But the first time I heard Coltrane, I was like, okay, this is a lot of notes, I'll listen to Witten Kelley or whatever. But, you know, but it grows on you, you know, I'm just wondering like, what was your first experience with him? Like, were you exposed to him through another musician?

Did you accidentally buy it, thinking it was something else? Trying to remember what the first record was, and it might have been, let's see, it might have been giant steps, which had Equinox on it also was an Atlantic record. I have to say that the emotion of it always grabbed me, even before I understood harmonically and rhythmically what he was doing. He went right through me immediately. Same with Wayne, when I heard Wayne's first music, I was about eight, I heard children of the night on the mosaic, our Blakey record.

I didn't understand what they were doing, but there was this searing quality, the saxophone, there was just this soulful cry that went boom right inside. Train was like that with me, the record with giant steps, even though that's a highly, that was again one of his manifestos harmonically. He laid this thing out that he'd been working on. Just, it's like Billy Hart said, whether he was playing one note or 30 million notes, it always sounds like he's playing a ballad. There's all this beauty and spiritual force coming through.

So even before I could understand it, and giant steps is a good example, Equinox is on that record which is slower also and very blues. I could always hear the, you know, his grandfather was a preacher, and that cadence is always in his playing too. That kind of vocal speech-like thing, and the tenor saxophone's very close to the human voice. So that always grabbed me, even though I didn't know what they were doing. So that was, it kind of grabbed me young.

Over here. This question sort of touches on everything that's a few questions I'd been asked before about a cult trains, a phenomenal commitment to practicing anecdotes about him playing a seed major scale for 11 hours straight. Just one of the curious as to how you think that informs his attitude on work versus faith, on the sheer aesthetic discipline of his practice regimen versus his commitment to spirituality later on in life. Wow. Did everybody hear that?

The question about how he pursued his art with practicing, practicing how that affected his art, whether his aesthetic, you know, musical aestheticism. What affected that have, was it a works mentality by practicing like this, this is you'll get good? You know, I have to say that when you redefine your instrument and you become a great virtuoso like trained did, I think he needed that to express the depth of his spiritual feelings that he had. I joke with my students, I hate when students say, I play what I feel, you know, I don't need to learn all this stuff. So yeah, when you have all those feelings and you're so frustrated because you can't get it out your hands.

Classical example, some people try to elevate naivete in music and sometimes even incompetence to like they worship that. Like if you know too much, well, then you can't be good. You can't play with feeling if you know too much. Coltrane shatters that to bits. There's no one more soulful on the planet that ever walked the planet and there's no one who knew that much on his instrument.

So it kind of blows away the works thing. In other words, he had to have all those that flexibility to say what it needed to say. And it never, to me, it never got out of proportion. It was misused. It was never technique for technique sake.

It was technique in the service of a masterful soulful expression of music that, you know, still saxophone players are trying to figure out what he did. It's been gone a long time. 40 years. Ask Mike Brecker and all these guys who are the pagan emis of today and they'll tell you that train is still their hero. The only thing I could add, it's amazing how many residences there are with everything else besides music. But in the beginning, I think almost anybody in a career in the very beginning, you are, it is a kind of works righteousness.

You're working hard because you want to be accepted. But you often see with people who get the acceptance they want. They get successful and they still go on. And I think it's because they realize at a certain point now I've got a vision. I want to get it out.

And obviously, my concern is more rhetoric and narrative. And I'm always frustrated now because I know what I want to say but I never feel like I quite get there to say it. In the earlier days of being a preacher, I worked by crazy because I wanted people to accept me. Now I'm accepted. I really want to say certain things that I can't do unless I work by crazy to do it.

I think John's absolutely right. There are some people that need to prove yourself, never goes away. And you can hear it in some musicians. It's always about me. Our little talks tonight said that somewhere, Coltrane because of his spiritual awakening, blew past that.

And it wasn't about him anymore. It wasn't works righteousness. Now he had a vision and he had a mission. And he just wanted to do it as well as he could. And that's what we all should be after.

And in fact, Miles used to say, why are you playing so long? Don't you ever take the horn out of your mouth? And Trane was so beautiful. He wasn't salty back or anything. I'm just trying to get to this thing and I got to get there.

And he was very humble. He felt like I can't quite get it. It's taken me that long. When I play one of my soul, it takes me a while. I'm trying to find this thing.

Meanwhile, the rest of us would love to be trying to find something like Trane. I wish I could try to find something like that too. Because his supposed searching and scuffling was 80 million times better than the rest of us could even imagine or dream. Good. Let's keep going back forth over here.

I know that there's a lot of deep emotional and spiritual music today. But I feel if you could reflect on the change in our mainstream attitude toward music,  I always feel like I'm looking back and capturing something greater than today. But I know it's there. We heard it tonight. It was amazing.

I just personally wish it was more of it. And maybe you have thoughts on your growth up position. Wow. So basically you're saying sometimes it just feels like there was a lot of deeper connection in the music back. When we listen to old records and we hear this purity that attracts us because it has nothing to do with marketing and Wall Street and lawyers negotiating contracts, frankly.

Yeah, I live in this world. We all do. And that's something that Brian and I talk a lot about. That's what Wayne Shorter. We all talk about this a lot.

We feel like we have a mission. We feel like we're swimming up stream a lot of times. But nonetheless, we feel compelled to continue. Sometimes it takes courage because the record companies, even with Wayne's group, frankly, they sometimes seem to value, but not much value on what we're doing. They're trying to chase the newest flavor of the month.

If they can get a pop singer and sell millions of records. Hey, that's where their priority is. So you can't let it get you bitter. You have to continue on your mission. You have to be disciplined.

Because if you let it, it'll stop you. And for me, there's an added thing about I feel like God has given me something important that I need to keep pursuing. Whether it's popular with the business folks or not. I really can't think about that. Yeah, I have to provide for my family, which I work hard to do.

But when it comes to my art and the music that I write and I play and the records that I make for myself, I feel of responsibility. To God to people, I must do the utmost thing I can do. The most I can use, whatever I have, to make the most honest music that I can, to reach out to people in an honest way, instead of trying to be something that's the flavor of the month this year, which changes every month. That's why somebody like Wayne shorter is so important. He never gave in.

He never stopped. And that's why train loved him also around. Thanks. Hi, and you earlier talk, you mentioned that one of the things that defines us is our work. And certainly I feel like it's taken a lot of my time.

Maybe it's because I'm not really a musician. I feel that sometimes my work takes me away from my spiritual side. So maybe you could give a guidance of sharing experience. How when times it's a you feel not disconnected with yourself. How you come back to present.

How do you come back to your spiritual side? Yes, I'll be brief. There's a sense in which there's a micro meaning and a macro meaning. The micro meaning, I think, your micro identity. That is, who are you?

Micro identity is, you look at your gifts, you look at what you're good at, and you do it. And there's that great place in the chair. It's a fire where Eric Little says, God made me fast. And when I run, I feel this pleasure. So if you're fast, you run.

If you're an artist, you do art and so forth. If you make great business deals, make great business deals. When you use your gifts that you've been given, you feel like you fit in the universe. That's what that line in the movie means. And from a Christian point of view, we think your gifts and talents aren't accidents.

They didn't happen just accidentally. It's what God wants you to be. That's your micro meaning. If you don't have the macro meaning, and the macro meaning is that you're a child of God, and that you have a relationship with him, and when I use the word child, this is a Christian understanding of this, a child of God. I have children.

And if one of my children does well, I'm very proud of them, and my heart goes out toward them. If one of my children does horribly and does everything wrong, I'm more engaged with them. In other words, being a father means I love my kids. And whether they're doing well or not doing well, whatever they do draws my heart out toward them. To be a child of God means I know that I'm in His grace, I've experienced His grace.

He loves me unconditionally. Knowing that is your macro meaning. If you don't have the macro meaning, then your micro meaning becomes the macro meaning. And that's really what the sickness on the death by Curegard is. When your work and your gifts become your whole meaning, then somehow you'll find, just like Tolkien felt, because he could never really write the book he wants, just like Tim Keller feels he could never really preach the ceremony once.

John Patatucci never can quite get out what he wants to get out. If that's the whole of your life, then you're always unhappy. You always feel like I'm falling short, I'm not doing what I want to do. So you've got to put your gift and your mission and your art and your work in a diamond in a bigger setting, and it's got to be a setting of knowing I'm a child of God. Without that, then the work becomes the idol and it drives you to the ground.

So I think there has to be a balance between the two things. And that's what makes people bitter too, I think. People are struggling and they can only see right in front of them. And they keep reaching for that thing and they can't quite get it. If that's all there is, then it's pretty rough existence being an artist.

Unless you have that hope. Now, even though I'm going back and forth, I think these folks have been waiting longer, so go ahead. Hi, I'm a mother of two jazz musicians, one who plays and the other promotes, and I also minister and I'm often going home on the train about three or four in the morning. And I see the passion in both of you, and I also find it in the musicians, including my sons, with whom I minister. And they're great spirits, but what I'm asking both of you is, I heard one of them say to me, we don't come to you and you don't come to us in terms of reaching out as Christians, as believers.

And I'm asking for ways because what I'd love to do is bring Brian to you and say, Brian, I want you to know a musician who believes in Jesus Christ. Is that your son's name, Brian? Oh, okay. And Andrew too. Yeah.

Well, bring him. And bring him on. Okay. I will. Yeah.

I've got tears in my eyes and I thank you all so much. Yeah. It just means so much. And there are so many people out there who need hope and future. And God has blessed me to do what I love doing and to reach out and this just inspires me so.

Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Go ahead.

Thanks. I have a question, but it doesn't have anything to do with music. Oh, no. Wait a minute. I don't know everything about everything else, but music.

Say I want to, I want to measure in science, and I want to be a teacher, but, and I believe in God. But part of that has to do with evolution. What if I don't believe in evolution, but I teach it. Have you deal with that? Fortunately, I can be real, real brief about this.

Your belief of evolution does not matter to your acceptance of the, you know, Orthodox teaches a Christianity. People who believe in the most orthodox faith have different views on evolution. So you cannot, it's a red herring to think that a particular view of evolution fits in with, say, Orthodox Christianity. If I don't have it, I can't be an Orthodox Christian. It's not true.

Now, I'm not going to go any further than that, but the point is that people have got all sorts of views on evolution across the spectrum, and, therefore, I always say to people,  figure out what you, you know, if Jesus is the son of God, resurrected from the dead, figure that out. That makes every difference. If that's the case, then you have to live like this. If it doesn't, then you don't have to live like this. You can live like this.

That's what matters. Don't even worry about the evolution thing. Get to that later. And I have very strong Christian friends that have virtually every view possible about evolution. So don't let it distract you.

Okay. Over here. Yes. I was just curious to hear some thoughts of yours about maybe some of John Coltrane's later work as a soloist versus some of his earlier works. Like, for instance, everything after interstellar space versus everything before.

Like I was thinking that when I listen to giant steps or interstellar space or anything from around that period, I hear, you know, his new concepts and his advanced new styles of playing more fully developed than when I listen to his some of his later work. And I always kind of wondered if that was maybe running parallel to what was going on in his spiritual life at the same time this surgeon. I don't know how to describe that because that's a very personal thing that he was doing. You know, I remember sometimes feeling like, well, you know, I have my favorites. I have many favorite periods of train and sometimes the absolute latest.

You know, I just, just when I thought that maybe, you know, I had heard some of the later stuff and I didn't like it as much as the earliest. Then I heard a track one time of him playing alto. It was very late Coltrane that destroyed me. It was unbelievable. It was with Alice Coltrane and him.

I don't know who maybe Rashid. I don't even know what record it was. I just think you have to dig around and you have to listen to it. You can't just listen to it once or twice and go, well, you know, I like giant steps better because there's a lot of stuff. You have to be patient.

But yeah, I can't speak for him because he was really on this amazing path and search that I can't say what he was thinking. And I really sometimes I have to go back. You know, I have a lot of Coltrane records a ton. But, you know, I go through periods where I listen a lot and then I move away from it for a while and then I come back. And the really late stuff is not what I often go to first when I come back to listen to him.

Do you mind if I follow? I was just wondering though, do you hear like the same levels of organization and where he was going technically or? I think whenever he played his horn throughout his entire life, there's always a genius level of organizational stuff happening. There's never a record you can point to where it's not. It's just overwhelming.

We've gone 30 minutes and some of you are voting that this time should be about up. I think because you've been waiting, I'll take one more question and I'm afraid this is going to be it everybody. Sorry, go ahead. Over here. Okay, this is an interesting question you might not expect.

Actually, when you guys were talking about music, I didn't get it. So, my question is, is there hope for someone that don't actually understand jazz? Like how about a three minute version of jazz for dummies? Here it is. I've got one for you.

People say I don't understand jazz. Okay, I always come back with, do you understand Beethoven or Mozart? Can you comprehend their genius yet? You can listen to the music and go, wow, you don't feel the need to try to understand it, do you? You just listen to it and go, wow, that's what jazz is like.

If you listen to culture and you don't have to understand what he's doing,  but you can just listen to the emotional part of it and you can either receive it and you don't have to receive it. I don't have emotions from it. You don't. Oh, okay. People cry when they hear some things and I don't get it.

Some people don't get computers, I don't get jazz. That's okay. That's really okay. I can't sit here and tell you that jazz is for every soul. So you actually could listen to the music that he wrote and say,  wow, he was really inspired by God.

He was really excited at this point and that point, really? Totally. Totally. Awesome. It's nice.

Well, but. Good for you. You know what it is? Yeah, and it's okay if you don't. I mean, for me, it was something that gripped me and it makes me cry when I hear him play.

That's great. Yeah, it's the same, by the way. My hero, CS Lewis says that there's a thread. There's a secret thread that every individual has a kind of unique thread of things  that move you. Music, literature, a landscape, a particular person, a spot on the earth.

That, and I was talking before about how Coltrane says,  there's also a great Leonard Bernstein quote that I was used. Bernstein said, when he hears Beethoven's fifth, even though he's an atheist,  he's basically, I have to believe in God. Now, everybody's got a little thread of what those things are. And some people's thread don't go through jazz, okay? But the point is that it doesn't determine isolation, so that's good.

Otherwise, I won't be in heaven with you, you know? Everybody's got a thread. Everybody's got a thread. And by the way, in my case, for example, I was a trumpet player. As tries, I couldn't do jazz.

I just couldn't do it. As a result, I just couldn't, even though at one point I was pretty good. I just couldn't do it. And in my case, it's sort of like, I look at these guys who can do it  with a certain kind of awe because I tried. I appreciate jazz quite a bit, but probably appreciate it a little differently  because I'm a failed jazz musician.

And therefore, I actually have a certain awe that you don't have. The real point is everybody's got that thread. For some people, it goes right to the down the center of jazz. For some people, it's mainly jazz. For some people, it's hardly at all.

With my wife, it's pretty much hardly at all. But on the other hand, her thread goes right to downtown Ballet. And I say, hmm. All right. Yeah.

So anyway, but everybody's got a thread. And that's the thing we've been talking about tonight. Listen, this guy is so well spoken. And a lot of you hear me a lot. But boy, this has been terrific to have John here tonight.

So let's give my hand for being here. Thank you. Thanks for coming.

### 引言：工作与圣经智慧

如果你有一份工作，你可能会经常想到它。但你有多少次思考过圣经对工作的看法呢？今天，在《福音与生活》中，提姆·凯勒向我们展示了圣经中一些非常有帮助且实用的智慧，我们可以将其应用于我们的工作中。这些智慧可能会让你感到惊讶，甚至改变生活。

### 柯川关于音乐与上帝的引言

我想谈谈约翰·柯川关于上帝与他的音乐关系的两句话。我认为每一句都告诉我们一些非常重要的事情。第一句告诉我们音乐和艺术与上帝的关系。第二句则谈到我们工作与上帝的关系。

### 音乐作为福音传播

换句话说，柯川的第一句话指出音乐作为福音传播。第二句话指出音乐作为服务。当我使用“福音传播”这个词时，我希望你能暂时摆脱这个词与政治、原教旨主义的任何关联，记住福音传播意味着希望的好消息。

这是第一句。约翰·柯川说，总的来说，我认为音乐家最想做的事情是向听众展示他在宇宙中知道和感受到的许多美好事物的画面。这就是我想做的事情。我认为这是你在生活中能做的最伟大的事情之一，我们都在以某种方式尝试做到这一点。音乐家通过他的音乐。

> “音乐可以告诉最绝望的心灵有希望，告诉最无意义的心灵有意义。”

**音乐有一种方式来到你面前，告诉你尽管你感觉如何，仍然有希望，有意义。**

### 音乐作为服务

柯川实际上指出音乐作为服务，这不仅适用于音乐家和艺术家，也适用于我们所有人。他在《至高无上的爱》的唱片封套中说，1957年，我经历了上帝的恩典，一次灵性觉醒，这将引导我过上更丰富、更充实、更有成效的生活。

> “那时，出于感激，我谦卑地请求被赋予通过音乐使他人快乐的手段和特权，激励他们更多地实现他们生活的意义。”

### 柯川的灵性旅程

斯蒂芬·J·戈尔德说得对，如果你认为生活是无意义的，那我是谁？你必须为自己创造意义。在像纽约这样的地方，我们大多数人找到确保我们有意义的方法之一就是通过我们的工作。

### 平衡艺术与崇拜

如果你将工作用作绝望的搜索，绝望的努力来给自己生活中的意义，讽刺的是你不会在工作中做得很好，但文化和一些事情发生了变化，改变了柯川的一切。

### 纪律的作用

现在，你知道，你有一个音乐家，你有一个牧师。我不知道你会问什么样的问题。但我们总是这样做，我们认为你们中的一些人会问问题。

### 在工作中寻找意义

据估计，我们大多数人将一半的清醒时间花在工作上。圣经的智慧如何应用于我们的职业？换句话说，我们的工作如何与上帝的工作相连，我们的职业如何变得更加情感化？

### 观众问答

嗨，你在早些时候的谈话中提到，我们的工作是定义我们的一件事。当然，我觉得它占用了我很多时间。也许是因为我不是真正的音乐家。我觉得有时我的工作让我远离我的灵性一面。所以也许你可以分享一些经验，当你感到与自己脱节时，你如何回到现在。你如何回到你的灵性一面？

---

### 结论

听着，这个人说得很好。你们很多人经常听到我说话。但天哪，今晚有约翰在这里真是太棒了。所以让我们为他的到来鼓掌。谢谢。谢谢你们的到来。

## Chinese Transcript / 中文

今天，在「福音与生活」节目中，Tim Keller 向我们展示，圣经对我们所做的工作有着极其有用而且实际的智慧。这些智慧也许会让你惊讶，甚至改变人生。

我想谈谈约翰·柯川关于上帝与他的音乐之间关系的两句名言。我认为，每一句都在告诉我们一件非常重要的事情。第一句告诉我们音乐和艺术与上帝之间的关系；

第二句则谈到，我们一般性的工作与上帝之间的关系。换句话说，柯川的第一句名言，把音乐看作是「福音传播」；第二句名言把音乐看作是「服事」。

当我使用「福音传播」（evangelism）这个词时，我希望你能暂时从脑海中把所有与政治、原教旨主义相关的联想都先抖掉，记得「evangelism」这个词本来就是「好消息」、「盼望的好消息」。

这是第一句名言。约翰·柯川说：总体来说，我认为一个音乐家最想做的事情，就是向听众呈现出他在宇宙中所知道、所感受到的种种美好事物的图景。这就是我想做的事。我认为，这是人生中你能做的最伟大的事情之一，而我们每个人都在以某种方式尝试着这样做。对音乐家来说，是通过他的音乐来做这件事。

柯川在说的是，音乐——不仅是歌曲的歌词，连音乐本身——都是一种福音传播的方式。音乐能对最绝望的心说：仍有盼望；能对最觉得人生毫无意义的心说：其实有意义。无论你头脑里相信什么，音乐都在对你说：你的人生不是「一段白痴讲的故事，充满喧哗与骚动，却毫无意义」。音乐会以一种方式临到你，对你说：不管你现在的感觉如何，仍然有盼望，仍然有意义。

哈佛已故古生物学家史蒂芬·杰伊·古尔德曾这样写道：我们之所以在这里，仅仅是因为某一支奇特的鱼群有着一种特殊的身体构造，刚好可以演化出陆地动物的四肢；我们之所以在这里，仅仅是因为某颗彗星在某个时间点撞上地球，消灭了恐龙，让哺乳动物获得了机会。我们渴望一个更高的答案，但并不存在这样的答案。我们来到这个世界并没有任何目的。我们必须自己构造人生的意义。

他要说的很简单：我们渴望相信我们存在有目的；渴望相信人生有意义，有盼望。但如果没有上帝，这一切都不存在。你可以告诉自己说这些是存在的，但实际上并不存在。你可以渴望一个更高的答案，但并没有这样的答案。

然而，阿什利·卡恩——一个在世界观上与古尔德完全相同的人——写了一本书，叫《至上之爱：约翰·柯川代表作的故事》。书中他说：当我一遍又一遍地听这张专辑时，我感到自己被迫要回应柯川那种热切的属灵性；虽然我自认为是一个忠诚的不可知论者、铁杆理性主义者，但我也准备承认，有许多事情似乎是某种永恒力量在属灵引导下的手笔。

（顺带一提，John 告诉我，他认识阿什利·卡恩。）你看，卡恩极不情愿地说：我对宇宙的看法和史蒂芬·古尔德完全一样。就我所知，我是一个铁面无私的理性主义者——我们存在并无任何目的；我们不是被创造的，我们只是偶然存在。生命没有意义，没有所谓的「重要性」。

可是，当他听到音乐的时候，他的心却告诉他另一回事。当他听那音乐时，他无法「不知道」——他无法不知那里有一种永不止息的爱，有真理，有意义。音乐在向他传福音。他的理性告诉他：这些东西不存在，上帝不存在；但他的心比他的头脑更清楚，而音乐正提醒他的心这一点，并且在印证这一点。对在座一切从事艺术的人来说，不论你是哪种艺术形式，艺术都拥有这样的力量。

如果你是一个艺术家，不管你是否意识到，你都在使用这种力量；但若你意识到自己在做什么，你的人生就会充满更多的成就感和满足感。

所以，第一点，我认为柯川首先向我们展示的，是艺术与属灵之间的连接，尤其是伟大音乐与上帝之间的属灵连接，以及伟大音乐如何传福音。其次，柯川也把音乐看作「服事」，这点不仅适用于音乐家与艺术家，也适用于我们所有人。

他在《至上之爱》的内页中写道：1957 年，在上帝恩典之下，我经历了一次属灵的觉醒，这使我进入一个更丰富、更充实、更有果效的人生。在那时，出于感恩，我谦卑地请求上帝赐给我途径与特权，能借着音乐使别人喜乐，激励他们越来越多地活出有意义的人生的潜能。因为生命确实有意义，我也觉得这是上帝藉着他的恩典赐给我的，一切荣耀归给上帝。

实际上，在这段话中，这两个主题都包含在内。但我要特别指出他如何谈论自己现在的工作是「服事」。古尔德说得没错：如果你觉得人生毫无意义，无论你是谁，你就得自己为自己建构一个意义。在像纽约这样的地方，特别是我们这些人最常用的方式之一，就是通过工作来这样做。透过工作，把工作做好，并不断往前爬，通过工作我们对自己说：现在我知道自己是有价值、有意义的。

换句话说，我们会把工作变成一切，以自我为中心。你看，如果你认识意义、价值、尊严的方式，是藉着你的音乐，那音乐，讽刺地说，最后就变成在表达「你自己」。矛盾的是，当音乐变成「关于你」的时候，它往往不再是好音乐。

C.S. 路易斯身为一位作家，也谈过类似的事。他说：那个拼命想要「原创」的艺术家，永远不会真正原创；那个拼命想给人留下好印象的艺术家，也不会留下真正好的印象。如果你把工作当作一场拼命的追寻，一场拼命的努力，想要为自己的人生添上意义，讽刺的是，你通常反而做不好那份工作。

但文化发生了变化，有些事情在他心里发生了变化。那天晚上，他演奏了那首《至上之爱》，一段 32 分钟的乐章，像倾盆倾泻的赞美与感恩。他那晚演奏得极其惊人，下台时有人听见他喃喃自语：「Nunc dimittis。」这是路加福音第 2 章中，西面看见婴孩耶稣、意识到自己见到弥赛亚时说的拉丁文开头两个字。

西面说：「如今，照你的话，释放仆人安然去世吧，因为我的眼睛已经看见你的救恩。」柯川在说的其实是：「我做成了。我完成了上帝把我放在世上的使命。如果现在要离开，我也可以了。」

他那种满足感从何而来？如果你经历过那种至上的爱——以至于你知道他爱你，不取决于你在台上表现得如何，不取决于你在工作中是否被称赞——如果你知道他以一种白白的、不配得的、自由的方式爱你，那工作就不再是「关于你」。工作是关于工作本身；音乐是关于音乐本身；是关于听众；是关于上帝；只是一个服事人的方式。讽刺地是，这样反而使作品变得好得多。

这不仅对音乐家适用，对我们所有人都是如此。柯川的意思是：如果你经历了「至上的爱」，那么你就不再用别人的掌声与认可来填满自己内心的空虚，反而能从你被填满的心里去服事别人。「Nunc dimittis」——多么令人惊叹的工作观。

以弗所书 2 章 10 节这样说——这里是我的翻译——「我们是上帝的艺术品，在基督耶稣里造成，为要叫我们行他早已预备叫我们行的善事。」当你知道自己是他手中的艺术品，你的艺术就成为一种福音传播和服事的方式。

以上是约翰·柯川关于上帝、属灵与音乐之间关系的一些观点。接下来，我只是一个牧师，并不是音乐家。下面我们要听的是来自纽约市立学院的一位教授、也是一位音乐家——约翰·帕塔图西的分享。

哇。

好，那么我想先从我在相当年轻的时候接触到柯川的音乐开始讲起。事实上，那时我真正的属灵旅程还没有开始。我大概 17 岁的时候才非常委身于基督信仰。但在那之前，我就已经听到柯川的音乐，也立刻爱上了它。他音乐里那种迫切感，即便是在《至上之爱》之前的作品里就已经存在，那种力量与美感强烈到让人难以招架。

伟大的爵士鼓手比利·哈特曾这么形容：当柯川在演奏时，即便他吹到最炽烈、最极致的高峰，你还是会觉得他像是在吹一首抒情曲。从他的萨克斯管里涌出的是爱的倾盆大雨。我认识的那些曾与他亲近相处的人都说，他是个非常温和而深邃的人。他所结交的音乐家阵容非同小可——他和迈尔斯、蒙克一起演奏，那些都是有远见又极其强烈的人物。

但你会发现，当你听到柯川时，会发生一种不同的事情。有时候，当你听其他人时，你知道他们是技艺的王者，是了不起的大艺术家，但难免会有一点「看我多厉害」的意味——你知道我的意思。当你听迈尔斯演奏时，他很清楚地在传递：「这就是我，我是迈尔斯，你看好了。」

而当柯川演奏时，就非常不一样。那是一种情感和纯粹的倾倒，是我以前从未在任何人身上经历过的。相信我，我是一个彻头彻尾的爵士迷，我有非常多唱片，我一生都浸泡在这音乐里。我很小就开始接触这音乐，大概八岁开始听，现在 46 岁，我在路上演出好多年，也和很多人谈论过这些。那些认识他的人说，去村庄先锋俱乐部听他演出，就像去教堂一样。你走进去就会感觉到，那不是一般的夜店演出，不是随便一个四重奏在那里演奏而已——那是柯川的乐队。我一想到没能亲眼见证，就会有点激动。

另外，他对身边人的态度也很特别。我曾与韦恩·萧特等许多在他身边的人相处过，他们说，柯川非常慷慨。是他向迈尔斯推荐韦恩·萧特的——他说：「外面有个家伙，他比我还厉害，你应该请他来。」当然，韦恩听到这话，自然又谦卑又震惊。你想想看，要在一个有迈尔斯、有柯川的乐队里接替柯川，是多大的压力。但这就是他这个人。他真的过着一个努力成为圣洁之人的生命，是一个极好的榜样，你每次听他演奏都会听得出来。

他的音乐让人抓心挠肺，总是深刻，从来没有多余的东西。无论他是在一秒里吹出一大堆音符，还是只吹出一个音，他都会抓住你，把你整个灵魂都摇醒。对我来说，因为我的信仰，我相信那是上帝亲手在做工。当我听他演奏时，那不只是一个人在吹奏乐器，而是上帝的声音在那号角里吼叫。

老实说，在我听过的所有音乐里，我从未在任何一个人身上这么强烈地感受到造物主威严的同在。我怀疑你很难在别处再找到那样的深度——也许根本不存在。至少在爵士乐里，我真不知道还有没有类似的。我只知道，听他的音乐，对我的冲击就是如此之大。另外，他在发展自己的恩赐这件事上从不懈怠。他没有浪费上帝给他的恩赐。他被赐予了一个惊人的天赋，却仍比任何人都更加努力。他不是那种 18 岁就一鸣惊人、震撼世界的早熟天才。

他是那种不断练习、不断撞墙、不断再继续的人。并不是那种「18 岁就什么都会」的天才。不。认识他在费城成长经历的人这么说。你去问吉米·希斯，他记得柯川在发展阶段的样子。再比如我曾和班尼·高尔森等从小和他一起长大的萨克斯手聊天。高尔森给我讲过一个有趣的故事：他和柯川以前会在高尔森妈妈家里 jam，她妈妈常招待他们去家里一起玩爵士。她总会说：「约翰，来，吹那首约翰尼·霍奇斯在杜克·艾灵顿乐队里吹的抒情曲。」每次他来，她都会叫他吹那首歌。

还有一个故事说，有一次他们在一个大乐队里，后来被告知演出取消了。结果他们在社区里晃的时候，却看到那场演出的海报贴得到处都是，演出照常进行，只是他们被炒了鱿鱼。于是他们垂头丧气地回到高尔森妈妈那里，她问：「孩子们，怎么了？」他们说：「我们本来以为要演那场演出的，可是演出还在，只是我们不在乐队里了。」她说：「没关系，总有一天，人们会花很多钱来听你们演奏。」

大约二十年后，在蒙特雷或纽波特爵士音乐节上，这话就应验了。那时班尼·高尔森在和阿特·布莱基演出，他写的曲子到处都在被演奏；柯川带着他的四重奏，他们在后台相遇，柯川忽然笑起来。高尔森问：「你笑什么？」他说：「你还记得你妈妈当年说的话吗？」这就是他这个人。我有幸曾与他的儿子拉维·柯川一起演奏过。但很可惜的是，拉维出生得比较晚，在父亲去世之前并没有太多机会真正认识他。

所以，我可以一直这样聊下去，可能会说个没完。也许我该停一下。但我真的很感谢大家的到来，这对我们来说都是一次非常情绪饱满的经历。布莱恩和我常与韦恩在路上，一路上我们也常常谈起柯川，因为韦恩过去常和他一起练琴。柯川会打电话给他说：「今天要过来吗？」然后他们就坐在钢琴前，一个人用手肘在键盘上尽可能多地按下一堆音说：「你能抓到多少？」另一个人就试着把那些声音都跑一遍。然后换另一个人来做同样的事。他们还会把爱丽丝的竖琴谱摊开来，一起练习，尝试更多和声。他们在追求卓越这件事上从不疲倦。

这对我们所有人——无论是在属灵上、音乐上、艺术上，还是整个人生——都是个巨大的功课。这就是我们今天来这里谈论这些事情的部分原因。现在你知道了，一个是音乐家，一个是牧师。我完全不知道你们会问出什么样的问题。但无论如何，我们总是这样做——留时间给你们提问。只是我们会说：尽量不要问关于汽车维修或外星生命的问题。几年前，有人曾在一次开放论坛里问我对外星生命的看法。我担心的是，约翰可能真的会知道这方面的事，所以我不太希望你们在这上面发问。

如果你有问题，这里这么大，你最好上前走到麦克风前面。我们不一定会花很长时间，也可能会，完全看你们。

好，请那边那位先来。今晚演出非常精彩。我的问题是关于柯川后期的作品，大概 1966、67 年那一段。那是一种非常嘈杂自由的风格。为什么你今晚没有演奏那一时期的作品呢？其实我很欣赏那些音乐，但对不熟悉爵士的人来说，听起来确实有点困难。我想听听你对他那个时期音乐的看法。

你要我谈谈他晚期的那些作品，比如《星际空间》（Interstellar Space）之类的吗？好，他的问题是关于柯川的晚期音乐——那些非常激烈、对不习惯听爵士的人来说可能难以入口的作品。

我想，有些作品确实非常具有挑战性，因为相当密集。但那里面也有很多美。我其实会推荐《星际空间》那张专辑——就是他和拉希德·阿里，只用萨克斯和打击乐。那里面有一些极其动人的音乐，同时也堪称萨克斯风的「遗嘱」式作品。那张唱片上他所做的事情简直不可思议，因此在情感层面上很有吸引力。那是极为优美的音乐，同时也极具力量。

他和多尔菲的合作又是另一种风格；他和法老·桑德斯在那些非常密集、很多人同时演奏的作品里又是另一回事。我一直认为，即便在那些作品里，你都能听到他清晰的异象。至于其他演奏者，有时候是不是都能跟得上他，那就存疑了。

对他而言，其实一直都是这样：他是一个追寻者——他不断要寻找新的东西。所以我觉得，他所有时期的尝试都有价值。有些模仿他的人，我倒不总是能耐心听完，因为很多时候，他们既没有他的音乐深度，也没有他的灵魂深度，只是跳上潮流，以为只要演奏自由即兴和前卫，就能像柯川一样。

好的，请继续问这样的题目——这类问题主要是给他的。那边请。

我不太确定接下来这个问题要问哪一位。你们提到他是一个「寻道者」，我最近这一周也读了不少关于他的属灵之路，想更多了解他的灵性。我很好奇，你们怎么看他在 1957 年之后，又继续在基督教以外探索的那段路，特别是与他后期音乐的关系？感觉那段探索似乎也和刚才你提到的那些较难听的音乐有关。

我知道，他确实持续在很多不同的方向探索。我知道他花了不少时间研究东方哲学。老实说，我并不知道，也没机会真的跟他谈过这些。天知道我多希望能有五分钟和他单独聊聊。但没有机会。你大概得去问他的家人才知道更多——也许是问爱丽丝，远比问孩子们合适——因为连他的孩子可能也没办法说得那么深入。

是的，他确实持续在研究很多不同的东西。让我简单补充一下。我今天尝试与你们分享的，是我相信我们可以从他身上看见的洞见——关于上帝对属灵、音乐和人生的重要性。我认为，没有人能确切知道如果他活得更久，会最终走到哪里，因为他当时还在探索各种宗教。

我的事奉楷模 C.S. 路易斯，同样是一位热切的基督徒，他却也相信：其他宗教里所蕴含的恩典与洞见，可能比许多基督徒乐意承认的还要多。所以，从我角度看，柯川关于上帝、音乐与属灵之间关系的那些基本洞见，无论如何都成立。但没错，他确实在旅程中，他在探索。可惜的是，我想他在找到一些问题的答案之前，就已经离世了。

我们得在两边之间来回一下，就让右边这位先问吧。谢谢今晚精彩的演出。我的问题也算是给两位的。就我所知，柯川在音乐与生活中都是一个极其强烈的人。据说在中场休息时，他会跑去练琴，或者和其他音乐家待在一起。他的音乐之所以变化那么大，就是因为他不停地练习、极度专注于音乐。

我想问的是，关于音乐和艺术本身，以及基督徒如何与之相处。当你把人生中如此多的时间、如此大的强度都奉献给音乐时，到什么程度，音乐会变成你所敬拜的对象？从你们刚才所说的来看，柯川似乎已经超越了这一点，把音乐变成敬拜上帝的方式，而不是音乐本身成为被敬拜的对象。我不太清楚这条界线在哪里——当你把每一个醒着的小时都花在练习、在任何艺术形式上追求极致时，那是一个偶像，还是一种惊人的献身，成为你敬拜上帝的方式？

这是个好问题。他在问，当你对自己的艺术非常投入——无论是音乐或其他艺术形式——当你为之不断练习，这条界线在哪儿？什么时候，这份投入会越界，变成你敬拜的偶像？

这是我们所有人都要面对的问题。我相信，只要你对音乐和生命诚实、充满热情，你就必须处理这个议题。我不能替柯川回答，他自己是怎么处理的，我不知道。我只知道，他确实被认识他的人视为认真地操练自己的人。他会吹完自己的独奏，离开麦克风，走进村庄先锋俱乐部的厨房，在麦考伊弹 solo 的时候接着练。他几乎一直在练。去他家的人说，每次见他进门，他脖子上都挂着萨克斯的背带。

但另一方面，我也知道，他其实很常待在家人身边。所以我很难说，我又不在场。我只知道，对我来说，这就是个巨大的挑战。我有妻子和两个女儿。我必须为家人留时间；对我而言，作为一个信徒，我还必须为神留时间。我需要安静时间，也需要研读时间。我在念神学，也爱看书，读了很多书。我真希望自己可以说，我找到了完美的平衡，从来不会越界；但老实说，我做不到。我只能说，我也在挣扎。

还好我有一位极棒的妻子，她可以很有恩典地拉住我，在我需要的时候提醒我，帮我拉回更广阔的视野，不要被那把木贝斯、电贝斯、钢琴或写作完全吞没。

不过我可以说一件事：你也得小心另外一种说法。有些人会说：「你知道吗？当你做音乐时，它可能成为偶像，把你和神隔开。」但事实上，有时候我觉得自己离神最近的时刻，正是我把那件乐器拿在手里、演奏的时候，在那一两个小时里，感受到他的同在，感觉到自己终于在生命中「让路」，不再紧抓方向盘。有时候，当我手上没有乐器时，我反而会迫不及待地把手又伸回方向盘上。

所以，情况是两方面的。有时候音乐会成为神对你说话的媒介：「你知道吗？先放一边，让我来做工。」所以既是挣扎，又是恩典。有时候，在你追求音乐的过程中，他还是会伸出怜悯，帮助你在这其中成长。

约翰说得非常美，也非常平衡。我唯一要补充的是，这个问题绝不仅仅是音乐的问题。如果你有一段糟糕的婚姻，那是一种试炼，是一个大难题，会带来巨大的属灵挑战。如果你有一段非常美好的婚姻，那同样也是一种试炼，是一个巨大的属灵挑战，因为你会不停地把配偶的爱、配偶的话，摆在上帝的爱之前。

所以，这不只是音乐的问题，我希望你们知道这一点。克尔凯郭尔说，罪的本质，就是把「任何东西」当作你身份的根基，只要不是上帝，就是罪。罪的本质不在于你做了多少坏事，而是把「好东西」变成「终极的东西」。任何在音乐、讲道、婚姻上做得很好的人，都一直活在这个 tension 里：一不小心就跨到偶像那边，又得不断被拉回来。我想，每个人都只能在这紧绷的边缘上生活，这就是你必须活着的地方。

研究估计，我们在醒着的时间里，大约有一半是在工作。那么，圣经的智慧如何应用在我们的职业中？换句话说，我们的工作如何与上帝的工作相连？我们的职业如何成为更具情感、也更有使命的事奉？

在他的书《凡事皆恩》中，Tim Keller 汇聚了多年关于「呼召与职业」的教导，向你展示如何在服事上帝和别人的过程中，在工作里找到真正的喜乐。这本书提供了许多令人意外的洞见，说明一个基督徒的工作观如何成为兴旺事业和平衡生活的根基。《凡事皆恩》是我们为感谢你向「福音与生活」奉献支持而准备的礼物，只要你愿意帮助我们把基督的爱传递给更多世界各地的人。欢迎访问 gospelandlife.com/give，gospelandlife.com/give。

好，我们回到右边这位。你刚才谈到，约翰·柯川的许多音乐是他属灵生命溢出来的表达。我想问的是，作为一名基督徒、又是一位艺术家，如果有时候你感觉不到神的同在，或者你根本没有那种感觉，你该怎么办？再加上，作为一名基督徒和艺术家，你需要操练（discipline）。那你要如何防止这种操练变成律法主义，或者变成一种苦差事？

抱歉，最后那部分我没太听清——你是说，如何防止操练变成律法主义，或者变成一种苦差事，对吗？

是的。我常对学生说一句话，我觉得非常真实。首先，我花了很多时间和韦恩·萧特的乐团在各地巡演。你今晚听到的鼓手布莱恩，就像我的另一只手臂一样，我们非常亲近。我可以告诉你，当我感觉自己陷入那种「枯干」状态的时候，会发生什么——比如，我们赶到演出现场，前面刚坐了两班飞机，又搭了车，人已经精疲力竭。你到了那地方，如果你想要对抗那种「工作变成苦差事」的感觉，或者属灵干旱、音乐干旱，觉得自己一点灵感都没有，唯一的出路就是跳出你自己。别再一直向内看，而是睁开眼睛看看周围——你身边还有其他人在一起，总会有人演奏出一些令人振奋的东西，只要你敞开，就会被点燃。

于是，三十秒前你还觉得自己累得什么都吹不出来，下一刻有人演奏了什么，你一下就被带动起来。如果你对这些保持开放，就会发生这样的事。相反，如果你一直想着：「哎呀，我这地方要怎么把那个音弹对？这个和弦怎么那么难？」如果你被这些东西缠住，那就像绑上铅块往水底沉。但如果你把注意力放到别人身上，会发生很奇妙的事情。

这其实也是你整个人生的隐喻，是你属灵生命的隐喻。上帝总是在呼召我们抬头仰望、从他那里领受，而不是紧抓方向盘、什么都要靠自己来操控——靠自己的行为、自己的努力来生成一切。如果你只是在想「只要我做到这件、那件，情况就会变好」，你就会进入那种隧道视野，封闭在自己里头，结果整个人蜷缩回自己里面。

那边。

五年前在「Directions in Music」巡演时，我看过你和布莱克、哈格罗夫、赫比·汉考克一起演出。在迈克尔·布莱克演奏《奈玛》之前，他花了两三分钟讲他收到第一张柯川专辑的故事。他描述自己当时大概十三岁，和别人一起听那张唱片的情景。他说，一开始听的时候完全听不懂，可后来却觉得那音乐有一种「情绪上和理智上的说服力」。我原本希望你刚才在分享自己九、十岁时听柯川的经历时能多讲一点，你刚刚只提到了开头。我想问的是，你第一次听到柯川的音乐时是什么感受？是立刻被吸引，还是像「这家伙在吹什么音阶」那样的困惑？对很多人来说，第一次听柯川是完全听不懂的。我自己是爵士钢琴手，第一次听他时，只觉得「好吧，这音符真多，我还是去听温顿·凯利吧」。但后来慢慢就爱上了。你第一次听到他的时候，是别人介绍你听的吗？还是你自己误打误撞买到的？

我现在要努力回想自己第一次听的是哪张唱片，可能是《巨人之步》（Giant Steps）——那张里还有《Equinox》，是大西洋唱片出的。我得说，即便在我还不懂他在和声和节奏上做什么之前，他的情感已经牢牢抓住我了。就像比利·哈特说的，无论他是在吹一堆音符，还是慢歌，你都能感受到那种炽热，而当中却有一种抒情的气质。他吹出的每个音里都有那种灵魂的呐喊，直接穿透我心。

当我第一次听韦恩·萧特时也是这样——我大概八岁，在阿特·布莱基的「Mosaic」那张专辑里听到《Children of the Night》。我根本听不懂他们在做什么，但那萨克斯里有一种灼热的声音，有一种灵魂的呼喊，直接击中我。柯川对我来说，就是那样。像《巨人之步》那样的唱片，虽然在和声上极其复杂，是他对自己长期探索的一个宣言，但里面那种情绪的浓度强烈到，让我即便在完全听不懂技术细节的时候，也能被打动。

那张专辑里还有《Equinox》这样的慢速、非常布鲁斯的曲子。我总能听到他身上那种「讲道式」的腔调——他祖父是牧师，那种讲道的节奏感一直存在他演奏里。萨克斯和人声极其接近，所以你会觉得那好像是一个人在讲话，而那讲话的节奏、起伏、抑扬顿挫，都像在传讲一篇道。这一切都紧紧抓住了我，远在我懂音乐结构之前。

好，那边请。

这个问题有点综合了前面几位的问题。关于柯川惊人的练习投入——比如那种他可以把一条 C 大调音阶练 11 小时的传说——我好奇的是，你认为这种极端的操练，对他在「工作」与「信仰」之间的看法有什么影响？他那种在美学上几乎苦修式的操练，与他后期属灵上的委身之间有怎样的关系？

哇。大家都听清楚了吗？他问的是，柯川在追求艺术上那种近乎苦修的练习，以及那种美学上的自我要求，是否是一种「行为称义」的心态：好像只要你这样练，就会变得很厉害？

我得说，当你重新定义了你的乐器，成为像柯川那样的绝对大师时，我认为，他需要那些练习的强度来表达他内心属灵感受的深度。他必须有那样的自由度，才能把自己所感受的表达出来。我常跟学生打趣说，我不喜欢有人跟我说：「我照着感觉演奏，我不需要学那些东西。」那种美化无知的浪漫很危险。

当你有那么多感受，却被困在手上、心里，却没法表达出来的时候，是一种极大的挫折。有些人甚至把音乐上的天真、甚至不熟练，抬到一种几乎被敬拜的高度，好像你知道得越少，反而越能「真情流露」。好像一旦你懂太多，就失去了感觉。

柯川把这种说法彻底粉碎。他是地表最有灵魂的演奏者之一，也是最懂自己乐器的人之一。所以，他打破了那种「技术与灵性互相排斥」的迷思。他所拥有的技巧，是为了承载那种庞大而深邃的属灵表达。如果他没有那样的技术，他无法把那些东西说出来。而在他身上，技巧从来没有失控，从来不是为了炫技，而是一直在服事那种丰富、饱满、极具灵魂的音乐。他所做的一切，如今萨克斯手们还在试图搞清楚。

他已经离世四十年了，你去问今天那些顶尖萨克斯手，比如迈克·布莱克等，那些站在巅峰的人都会告诉你——柯川仍是他们的英雄。

我唯一能补充的是，这和音乐以外的许多领域都有惊人的共鸣。在刚入行的时候，我想几乎任何人，在职业生涯初期，都是带着某种「行为称义」心态工作：你拼命努力，因为你想要被接纳。但你常看到有些人，即使后来已经得到所有掌声和成功，还是不停往前，因为他们发现，自己已经有了一个必须完成的「异象」。

我现在的关注点更多是修辞和叙事。我一直处在这样的挫折里：我知道自己想说什么，却总觉得自己没能说得那么好。在我刚开始做传道人时，我拼命工作，是为了让人接纳我；现在我知道自己已经被接纳了，但我真的很想把某些东西说出来，而要做到这一点，我还是得拼命工作。

我认为约翰说得对极了。有些人「证明自己」的欲望从来不会消失，从他们演奏里你也听得出来——永远是关于「我」。但从今晚我们多次提到的，柯川在属灵上的觉醒看，他似乎已经跨越了那一点。对于他来说，音乐不再是「行为称义」，而是他有了一个从神而来的异象和使命，他只是尽自己所能，把这使命完成得好一点。这也是我们所有人应该追求的。

事实上，迈尔斯曾经说：「你为什么吹那么久？你就不能把萨克斯从嘴边拿开一会儿吗？」柯川的回应非常美，他一点也不反驳，只是说：「我在努力想要抵达某个东西，而这需要这么长的时间。」他非常谦卑，他觉得：「我还没找到，吹一段独奏需要这么久，是因为我要找的东西就在里面。」与此同时，其他人都在想：「要是我也能那样『找东西』就好了。」

我们都希望自己也能像他那样「找东西」。因为他所谓的「寻找与挣扎」，已经远远比我们所能想象或梦想的境界高上八千万倍。

不错，我们继续左右交替，那边请。

我知道今天仍有许多情感深厚、属灵丰富的音乐，但我总觉得，当我回头去听那些旧唱片时，好像那里面有一种比今天更伟大的东西。当然我知道，今天仍然有这样的音乐，我们刚刚就听到了，十分动人。我只是私下希望，这样的音乐能更多一些。不知道你身为「成长在那个时代」的一代音乐家，对今天主流音乐的态度有什么看法？

哇，你的意思是，有时候我们听那些老唱片，会感觉音乐里有更深的连结——那种纯净的东西吸引我们，因为里面没有市场营销、没有华尔街、没有律师在谈合约，对吗？

是的，我们都活在这个世界。我也是，大家都是。布莱恩和我常常谈论这些，韦恩·萧特也时常谈。我们觉得自己有一种使命感，同时也常觉得好像在逆流而上。但即便如此，我们仍然觉得有股力量在催促我们继续往前。有时候，这确实需要勇气，因为即便是韦恩·萧特的乐团，唱片公司对我们做的事的重视程度有时候也非常有限。他们更乐意追逐当年最热门的那种歌曲——如果能签一个流行歌手卖出几百万张，那才是他们真正的优先。

所以你不能让这些把你变成一个苦毒的人，你必须继续走自己的路，必须有操练。如果你让这些东西把你绊住，就会停下来。对我而言，还有一个额外的负担：我觉得上帝给了我一些重要的东西，要我继续追求。不管这是不是当下市场的主流，我都不能太在意。是的，我必须养家糊口，为妻子孩子负责，所以我很努力工作。但当说到我的艺术、我的创作、我自己发行的唱片时，我觉得自己对上帝、对人都有责任，必须用我所有的一切去创作最诚实的音乐，用最诚实的方式向人伸出手，而不是去追逐每年一换的「当红口味」。这也是为什么像韦恩·萧特那样的人如此重要——他从来没有妥协，也从未停止。

谢谢。那边这位。

你刚才提到，我们被定义的其中一个重要部分是我们的工作。我确实觉得工作占据了我非常多时间。也许因为我不是音乐家，我常常觉得工作把我从自己的属灵面切割开来。你们是否能分享一些经验：在那种觉得自己与真正的自我、与属灵生命脱节的时候，你是如何回到「当下」、回到属灵中心的？

是的，我简短一点回答。从某种意义上说，我们每个人都有一个「小我身份」和一个「大我身份」。所谓的小我，就是你看着自己的恩赐、看自己擅长什么，然后就去做那件事。那部电影《烈火战车》里那句很棒的台词：艾瑞克·里德尔说：「上帝造我很快，当我奔跑时，我能感到他的喜悦。」如果你跑得快，你就去跑；如果你是艺术家，你就去做艺术；如果你擅长做商业，你就去做好的商业。当你使用上帝给你的恩赐，往往会有一种「我在宇宙的某个位置刚好合适」的感觉。这就是那句台词在讲的东西。

从基督信仰的角度看，我们认为你的恩赐和才能不是巧合，不是随机发生的。那是上帝想要你成为的人。这就是你「小我」的意义。但如果你没有「大我」的意义——那个宏观的身份——那就是，你是上帝的儿女，你跟他有关系。当我用「儿女」这个词时，这里指的是基督信仰中的理解：上帝的儿女。

我有孩子。如果我的孩子做得很好，我会以他们为荣，我整颗心都会被吸引向他们。如果我的孩子一团糟、做了很多行径不当的事，我反而会更投入他们的生命。换句话说，作为父亲，意味着我爱他们，无论他们表现好或不好。孩子做的任何事都会激发我向他们伸出心。所以，成为上帝的儿女，意味着：我知道自己在他的恩典里，经历过他的恩典，他无条件地爱我。

知道这一点，就是你的「大我」意义。如果你没有这样的「大我」，那么你的「小我」就会变成「大我」——你的工作、你的才能就会变成全部。这也正是克尔凯郭尔在《致死之病》里所描述的：当你把工作和恩赐当作整个生命的意义时，你最终会发现，如同托尔金、如同我自己一样——你永远觉得自己没有写出、说出、做出自己真正想做的那件事。如果那就是你生命的一切，你就会永远不快乐，永远觉得自己达不到、总是在失败。

如果你没有那更大的框架，那工作最终就会变成你的偶像，把你压垮。因此，你必须把你的恩赐、使命、艺术、工作镶嵌在一个更大的底座里，而那块底座必须是「我知道自己是上帝的儿女」。没有这块底座，工作就变成偶像，把你磨到精疲力尽。

所以，我想这两者必须平衡。这也是为什么这么多人会变得苦毒——人们在挣扎，只能看到眼前的一点点，却一再伸手想抓住那个他们以为能拯救自己的东西，却始终抓不到。如果那就是全部，那作为艺术家就会是一种相当艰难的生命，除非你有那样的盼望。

既然我一直在两边来回，看起来这边的朋友等得更久，就让你来问最后一个问题吧。

你好，我是两个爵士音乐人的母亲，一个演奏，一个做推广。我也在服事，当我和孩子们一起服事时，我们家常常是凌晨三四点才坐地铁回家。我在他们以及其他音乐人身上都看到了那种热情，但我也发现，我和他们一起服事的那些音乐人当中，有许多有很好的灵性，其中也包括我自己的两个儿子。有一次，其中一个跟我说：「我们不会主动去找你们，你们也不会主动来找我们。」他的意思是说，作为基督徒、作为信徒，我们似乎很少主动去接近他们。我想问两位的是，有没有什么方式，能让像我这样的人可以更具体地把基督信仰带给音乐人？因为我多么希望可以带着我的儿子布莱恩来见你，对他说：「布莱恩，我想让你认识一位相信耶稣基督的音乐家。」

你儿子也叫布莱恩吗？哦，好。还有安德鲁，对吧？好。那就带他们来吧。带他们来见面就好。

我已经感动到眼眶含泪，非常感谢你们。对我们来说，这意义重大。外面有太多人需要盼望和未来。上帝赐给我恩典，让我做自己热爱的事，也能向人伸出手，而你们今晚的分享更是给了我巨大的鼓励。

谢谢你。谢谢。

那边请。

谢谢。我有个问题，但跟音乐关系不大。哦不，好吧。音乐以外的事我可不是什么都知道啊。假设我想主修科学，未来当一名教师，我相信上帝，但在这其中有「进化论」的问题。如果我不相信进化论，但在课堂上却要教进化论，该怎么办？

这问题我可以很简短地回答。你对进化论的看法，并不是你能否持守「正统」基督信仰的决定性因素。相信最传统、最核心教义的基督徒，对进化论也有各种不同看法。因此，不能说某一种关于进化论的观点，才算是「正统基督徒」必须持守的观点——事实并非如此。

我不会在这里展开细节，只要记得一点：关于进化论，基督徒在整个光谱上都有各种看法。因此，我总是鼓励人：先搞清楚另一件更重要的事——耶稣是不是上帝的儿子，是否从死里复活？如果是，那就改变了一切。如果这是真的，你就必须以某种方式活；如果不是真的，你就可以用另一种方式活。这才是关键。不要先被进化论的问题带偏，那个可以放到后面再说。我有一些非常虔诚的基督徒朋友，在进化论上几乎覆盖了整个立场光谱。所以，不要让这个问题分散你对更根本问题的专注。

好，那边。

我想听听你们对柯川早期与后期作为独奏者之间差异的看法。比如说，从《星际空间》往后的作品，与之前的作品相比。我自己的感觉是，当我听《巨人之步》或《星际空间》或那个时期的东西时，他那些新的观念、全新的演奏方式在那时好像更成熟、也更充分；反而在他一些更晚期的作品里，好像没有那么完整。我总是在想，这会不会和他属灵生命的状态并行？

我很难用一句话描述，因为那真的是他很个人的一段旅程。我记得有一阵子，我也常觉得：「好吧，我有自己最爱的柯川时期。」我有许多喜欢的不同阶段，有时候，最晚期的作品并不是我最常听的。就在我以为自己不那么喜欢某些后期作品时，我却突然听到他演奏中音萨克斯的一首晚期录音，完全把我击溃，简直惊人，是他和爱丽丝·柯川一起演的，鼓手可能是拉希德，但我已经不太记得是哪张专辑了。

所以我想说的是，你必须亲自挖掘、反复去听，不能只听一两次就说：「好吧，我还是更爱《巨人之步》吧。」里面有太多东西需要时间。至于属灵状态，我真的无法替他说话，因为他正走在那条极其奇特的路上，我没法说他当时在想什么。有时我也得停下来，过一段时间再回到那些作品。我有很多柯川的唱片，但是我会经历一种周期：一阵子里我会频繁听他，然后又暂时离开，再回去听。而在回来的时候，我通常不是先从最晚期的作品开始听。

你介意我追问一句吗？我想问的是，从你的角度看，你是否在后期作品里听到和早期一样的结构性与技术深度？

我认为，只要他拿起乐器，不论是人生的哪个阶段，他在结构上的处理始终是天才级别的。没有任何一张唱片可以说「这里没有结构」，每一张都令人震惊。

我们已经回答问题 30 分钟了，有些人可能觉得时间差不多了。我想，因为这位朋友已经等了很久，就再回答最后一个问题，然后我们就要结束，抱歉不能一一回答所有人。

你刚才提到，当你们谈论音乐时，我没有听懂。所以我的问题是：对一个完全听不懂爵士的人来说，还有希望吗？能不能给我一个三分钟的「爵士白痴入门」？

好，我有一个说法。人们常跟我说：「我听不懂爵士。」我通常会反问：「那你听得懂贝多芬或莫扎特吗？你能掌握他们天才的全部吗？」但你仍然可以听那些音乐，觉得「哇，真美」，也不觉得自己必须「听懂」才行，对吧？你只是听，然后说：「哇。」

爵士其实也是这样。如果你听柯川，不需要知道他在做什么，只要去听那情感的部分，你可以选择接受那份感动，也可以不接受。我听音乐的时候不会有那种情绪上的反应。

没关系。有些人听某些音乐会感动到落泪，我也不一定能理解。有些人搞不懂电脑，你搞不懂爵士，也是一样的事。这没关系。爵士并不一定适合每一个灵魂。

所以你听他的作品时？

是的，我听的时候会觉得很惊人，非常受感动。

很好。很好。你知道吗？没关系，如果你感受不到同样的东西。对我来说，那音乐会让我落泪。但这没有谁对谁错。

很好。你知道吗？真正重要的是——这不会决定你的永恒归宿，否则我就不能和你一起在天堂了（笑）。爵士只不过是那条「线」中的一段而已。

路易斯说过，每个人内心都有一条「秘密的线索」。每个人被打动的东西——音乐、文学、一片风景、一个人、世界上的某个角落——都不一样。我刚才提到，柯川说过那句话，其实我也常引用另一个莱纳德·伯恩斯坦的名言。伯恩斯坦说，每次听到贝多芬第五交响曲，即便他是个无神论者，也会觉得自己不得不相信上帝。

每个人心里都有这样的一条线索，沿着这条线，一些事物能使你对上帝的真实与美产生一种无法否认的感受。有些人的线索刚好穿过爵士，有些人则主要不是爵士；对有些人来说，爵士几乎不在那条线上。对我妻子来说，爵士几乎完全不在那条线索上，她的线索则是芭蕾——她听到、看到芭蕾时会被深深打动，而我则更多是「嗯，好。」

但这没关系。每个人都有那条线，我们今晚讨论的正是这些。对某些人来说，这条线正好经过爵士，对另一些人来说则不是，但这不会改变我们在上帝面前的地位。

你看，这个人真是口才极佳。你们常听我讲道，但今晚能有约翰在这里，真是太好了。我们再给他一点掌声，谢谢他今晚来到这里。

谢谢。也谢谢各位的到来。

今天，在「福音与生活」节目中，Tim Keller 向我们展示，圣经对我们所做的工作有着极其有用而且实际的智慧。这些智慧也许会让你惊讶，甚至改变人生。

我想谈谈约翰·柯川关于上帝与他的音乐之间关系的两句名言。我认为，每一句都在谈一件非常重要的事情。第一句告诉我们音乐和艺术与上帝之间的关系；

第二句则谈到，我们一般性的工作与上帝之间的关系。换句话说，柯川的第一句名言，把音乐看作「福音传播」；第二句名言把音乐看作「服事」。

当我使用「福音传播」（evangelism）这个词时，我希望你能暂时从脑海中把所有与政治、原教旨主义相关的联想先抖掉，记得「evangelism」这个词本来就是「好消息」、「盼望的好消息」。

这是第一句名言。约翰·柯川说：总体来说，我认为，一个音乐家最想做的事情，就是向听众呈现他在宇宙中所知道、所感受到的许多美好事物的图景。这就是我想做的事。我认为，这是人生中你能做的最伟大的事情之一，而我们每个人都在以某种方式尝试着这样做。对音乐家来说，是通过他的音乐来做这件事。

柯川在说的是，音乐——不仅是歌词，连音乐本身——都是一种福音传播的方式。音乐能对最绝望的心说：仍有盼望；能对最觉得人生毫无意义的心说：其实有意义。无论你头脑里相信什么，音乐都在对你说：你的人生不是「一段白痴讲的故事，充满喧哗与骚动，却毫无意义」。音乐会以一种方式临到你，对你说：不管你现在的感觉如何，仍然有盼望，仍然有意义。

哈佛已故古生物学家史蒂芬·杰伊·古尔德曾这样写道：我们之所以在这里，仅仅是因为某一支奇特的鱼群有着一种特殊的身体构造，刚好可以演化出陆地动物的四肢；我们之所以在这里，仅仅是因为某颗彗星在某个时间点撞上地球，消灭了恐龙，让哺乳动物获得了机会。我们渴望一个更高的答案，但并不存在这样的答案。我们来到这个世界并没有任何目的。我们必须自己为自己构造人生的意义。

他说的其实很简单：我们渴望相信，我们在这里是有目的的；渴望相信人生有意义、有盼望。但如果没有上帝，这一切都不存在。你可以告诉自己说这些是存在的，但实际上并不存在。你可以渴望一个更高的答案，但并没有这样的答案。

然而，阿什利·卡恩——一个在宇宙观上与古尔德完全相同的人——写了一本书，叫《至上之爱：约翰·柯川代表作的故事》。书中他说：当我一遍又一遍地听这张专辑时，我感到自己被迫去回应柯川那种热切的属灵性；虽然我自认为是一个忠诚的不可知论者、铁杆理性主义者，但我也准备承认，有许多事情似乎是某种永恒力量在属灵引导下的手笔。（顺带一提，John 告诉我，他认识阿什利·卡恩。）

你看，卡恩极不情愿地说：我对宇宙的看法和史蒂芬·古尔德完全一样。就我所知，我是一个铁面无私的理性主义者——我们存在并无任何目的；我们不是被创造的，我们只是偶然存在。生命没有意义，没有所谓的「重要性」。

可是，当他听到音乐的时候，他的心却告诉他另一回事。当他听那音乐时，他无法「不知道」——他无法不知那里有一种永不止息的爱，有真理，有意义。音乐在向他传福音。他的理性告诉他：这些东西不存在，上帝不存在；但他的心比他的头脑更清楚，而音乐正提醒他的心这一点，并且在印证这一点。

实际上，在座凡是从事任何艺术形式的人，你们都知道，艺术有这样的力量。如果你是一个艺术家，不管你是否意识到，你都在使用这种力量；但若你意识到自己在做什么，你的人生就会更充实，也会更满足。

所以，第一点，我认为柯川首先向我们展示的，是艺术与属灵之间的连接，尤其是伟大音乐与上帝之间的属灵连接，以及伟大音乐如何传福音。其次，柯川也把音乐看作「服事」，这点不仅适用于音乐家与艺术家，也适用于我们所有人。

他在《至上之爱》的内页中写道：1957 年，在上帝恩典之下，我经历了一次属灵的觉醒，这使我进入一个更丰富、更充实、更有果效的人生。在那时，出于感恩，我谦卑地请求上帝赐给我途径与特权，能借着音乐使别人喜乐，激励他们越来越多地活出有意义的人生的潜能。因为生命确实有意义，我也觉得这是上帝藉着他的恩典赐给我的，一切荣耀归给上帝。

实际上，在这段话中，这两个主题都包含在内。但我要特别指出他如何谈论自己现在的工作是「服事」。古尔德说得没错：如果你觉得人生毫无意义，无论你是谁，你就得自己为自己建构一个意义。在像纽约这样的地方，特别是我们这些人最常用的方式之一，就是通过工作来这样做。透过工作，把工作做好，并不断往前爬，通过工作我们对自己说：现在我知道自己是有价值、有意义的。

换句话说，我们会把工作变成一切，以自我为中心。你看，如果你认识意义、价值、尊严的方式，是藉着你的音乐，那音乐，讽刺地说，最后就变成在表达「你自己」。矛盾的是，当音乐变成「关于你」的时候，它往往不再是好音乐。

C.S. 路易斯身为一位作家，也谈过类似的事。他说：那个拼命想要「原创」的艺术家，永远不会真正原创；那个拼命想给人留下好印象的艺术家，也不会留下真正好的印象。如果你把工作当作一场拼命的追寻，一场拼命的努力，想要为自己的人生添上意义，讽刺的是，你通常反而做不好那份工作。

但文化发生了变化，有些事情在他心里发生了变化。那天晚上，他演奏了那首《至上之爱》，一段 32 分钟的乐章，像倾盆倾泻的赞美与感恩。他那晚演奏得极其惊人，下台时有人听见他喃喃自语：「Nunc dimittis。」

「Nunc dimittis」这两个拉丁词，是路加福音第 2 章中，西面在看见婴孩耶稣、意识到自己见到弥赛亚时所说的话的开头。他说：「主啊，如今可以照你的话，释放仆人安然去世了；因为我的眼睛已经看见你的救恩。」

柯川当时实际上在说：「我做成了。我已经完成了上帝把我放在世上要我做的一切。如果现在非要离开，我也准备好了。」

他那种满足感从何而来？如果你经历过那种至上的爱，以至于你知道他爱你，不取决于你在台上表现得如何，不取决于你在工作中是否被称赞——如果你知道，他以一种不配得、白白的方式爱你，那么工作就不再是「关于你」。工作是关于工作本身；音乐是关于音乐本身；是关于听众，是关于上帝。它只是一条服事人的道路，而讽刺的是，这样反而使作品变得好得多。

这不仅对音乐家适用，对我们所有人都是如此。柯川的意思是：如果你经历了「至上的爱」，那么你就不再用别人的掌声与认可来填满自己内心的空虚，反而能从你被填满的心里去服事别人。「Nunc dimittis」，这是多么令人惊叹的工作观。

以弗所书 2 章 10 节这样说——这里是我的翻译：「我们是上帝的艺术品，在基督耶稣里造成，为要叫我们行他早已预备叫我们行的善事。」当你知道自己是他手中的艺术品，你的艺术就成为一种福音传播和服事的方式。

以上是约翰·柯川关于上帝、属灵与音乐之间关系的一些观点。接下来，我只是一个牧师，并不是音乐家。下面我们要听的是来自纽约市立学院的一位教授、也是一位音乐家——约翰·帕塔图西的分享。

哇。

好，那么我想先从我在相当年轻的时候接触到柯川的音乐开始讲起。事实上，那时我真正的属灵旅程还没有开始。我大概 17 岁的时候才非常委身于基督信仰。但在那之前，我就已经听到柯川的音乐，也立刻爱上了它。他音乐里那种迫切感，即便是在《至上之爱》之前的作品里就已经存在，那种力量与美感强烈到让人难以招架。

伟大的爵士鼓手比利·哈特曾这样形容：当柯川在演奏时，即便他吹到最炽烈、最极致的高峰，你还是会觉得他像是在吹一首抒情曲。从他的萨克斯管里涌出的是爱的倾盆大雨。我认识的那些曾与他亲近相处的人都说，他是个非常温和而深邃的人。

他所结交的音乐家阵容极不简单——他和迈尔斯、蒙克一起演奏，那些都是有远见又极其强烈的人物。但你会发现，当你听到柯川时，会发生一种不同的事情。有时候，当你听其他人时，你知道他们是技艺的王者，是了不起的大艺术家，但难免会有一点「看我多厉害」的意味——你知道我的意思。当你听迈尔斯演奏时，他很清楚地在传递：「这就是我，我是迈尔斯，你看好了。」

而当柯川演奏时，就非常不一样。那是一种情感和纯粹的倾倒，是我以前从未在任何人身上经历过的。相信我，我是一个彻头彻尾的爵士迷，我有非常多唱片，我一生都浸泡在这音乐里。我从很小就开始接触这音乐，大概八岁开始，目前 46 岁，在路上演出多年，也和很多人谈论过这些。那些认识他的人说，去村庄先锋俱乐部听他演出，就像去教堂一样。你走进去就会感觉到，那不是一般的夜店演出，不是随便一个四重奏在那里演奏而已——那是柯川的乐队。我一想到没能亲眼见证，就会有点激动。

另外，他对身边人的态度也很特别。我曾与韦恩·萧特等许多在他身边的人相处过，他们说，柯川非常慷慨。是他向迈尔斯推荐韦恩·萧特的——他说：「外面有个家伙，他比我还厉害，你应该请他来。」当然，韦恩听到这话，自然又谦卑又震惊。你想想看，要在一个有迈尔斯、有柯川的乐队里接替柯川，是多大的压力。但这就是他这个人。他真的过着一个努力成为圣洁之人的生命，是一个极好的榜样，你每次听他演奏都会听得出来。

他的音乐让人抓心挠肺，总是深刻，从来没有多余的东西。无论他是在一秒里吹出一大堆音符，还是只吹出一个音，他都会抓住你，把你整个灵魂都摇醒。对我来说，因为我的信仰，我相信那是上帝亲手在做工。当我听他演奏时，那不只是一个人在吹奏乐器，而是上帝的声音在那号角里吼叫。

老实说，在我听过的所有音乐里，我从未在任何一个人身上这么强烈地感受到造物主威严的同在。我怀疑你很难在别处再找到那样的深度——也许根本不存在。至少在爵士乐里，我真不知道还有没有类似的。我只知道，听他的音乐，对我的冲击就是如此之大。

另外，他在发展自己的恩赐这件事上从不懈怠。他没有浪费上帝给他的恩赐。他被赐予了一个惊人的天赋，却仍比任何人都更加努力。他不是那种 18 岁就一鸣惊人、震撼世界的早熟天才。

他是那种不断练习、不断撞墙、不断再继续的人。并不是那种「18 岁就什么都会」的天才。不。认识他在费城成长经历的人这么说。你去问吉米·希斯，他记得柯川在发展阶段的样子。再比如我曾和班尼·高尔森等从小和他一起长大的萨克斯手聊天。高尔森给我讲过一个有趣的故事：他和柯川以前会在高尔森妈妈家里 jam，她妈妈常招待他们去家里一起玩爵士。

她总会说：「约翰，来，吹那首约翰尼·霍奇斯在杜克·艾灵顿乐队里吹的抒情曲。」每次他来，她都会叫他吹那首歌。还有一个故事说，有一次他们在一个大乐队里，后来被告知演出取消了。结果他们在社区里晃的时候，却看到那场演出的海报贴得到处都是，演出照常进行，只是他们被炒了鱿鱼。于是他们垂头丧气地回到高尔森妈妈那里，她问：「孩子们，怎么了？」他们说：「我们本来以为要演那场演出的，可是演出还在，只是我们不在乐队里了。」

她说：「别担心，总有一天，人们会花很多钱来听你们演奏。」

音乐节。当然，Benny Golson 那时正跟 Art Blakey 一起演出。

他的曲子到处都在被演奏。Train（Coltrane）带着他的四重奏，他们在后台，Train 突然开始大笑。有人就问他：你笑什么？他说：还记得我们被炒掉那次，你妈妈说的话吗？所以他真的是一个很美好的人。

我很幸运能和他的儿子 Ravi 一起演出过。但连 Ravi 都很不幸，他出生得比较晚，在约翰去世之前其实没机会真正认识自己的父亲。所以我大概可以一直絮絮叨叨讲下去，也许我该停下来。但我只是想谢谢你们来看演出。

对我们所有人来说，这都是一次非常情绪饱满的经历。我和 Brian 以前常常在路上跟 Wayne 一起跑场。我们经常聊 Train，因为 Wayne 以前会跟他一起练习。Train 会给他打电话说，“你今天要过来”，然后他们就会一起坐在钢琴旁。然后有一个人——Train 会走到钢琴前，用两个胳膊尽可能多地按下能按到的键，然后问：“你能搞定多少这些声音？”

接着 Wayne 就会试着把这些音都跑一遍。然后换 Wayne 来按一堆音，Train 再来跑一遍。然后他们还会把 Alice 的竖琴教材拿出来，练竖琴的曲子，试着得到更多的和声。他们在追求卓越这件事上一点也不知疲倦。

在这件事上，对我们所有人来说都有一个巨大的功课——在灵性上、在音乐上、在艺术上、在生命里。所以这也是我们今天在这里的部分原因，要谈这些事。现在你们看，一个是音乐家，一个是牧师，我完全不知道你们到底会问出什么样的问题。

但我们每次都会做这种开放问答，我们觉得你们中有些人一定会提问题。不过我们建议，不要问什么关于汽车修理啊，或者外星生命的问题。有一次我在这里办开放论坛，我还记得好多年前，有人问我对外星生命的看法。我其实有点担心的是，John 也许真的已经知道那方面的事了，所以我一点也不想你们问这类问题。

如果你有问题——这里地方挺大——你最好走到其中一个麦克风那儿去。我们来看看。而且我们不一定会花太久时间，也可能会多花一点时间。

这就看你们了。呃哈，来吧。今晚的演出太棒了。我的问题是关于他后期音乐的呈现。

我想大概是 66、67 年那段。

那是种很吵的、自由即兴的风格。你们为什么今晚没有演奏那段时期的作品呢？其实，我是欣赏那些音乐的，但听起来确实有点难。我想听听你对他那段时期音乐的看法。

你是想听我对他晚期作品的想法，比如《Interstellar Space》之类的？好。——他在问的是 Coltrane 的晚期音乐。

对，Coltrane 晚期的音乐，非常强烈，有时候对不太习惯听爵士的人来说，可能并不那么好入口。

我觉得有些作品确实听起来很有挑战，因为它们非常“密集”。但里面也有很多美感。其实我会推荐《Interstellar Space》那张专辑。因为那是他和 Rashied Ali 的二重奏，只有萨克斯加打击乐。里面有一些让人惊叹的优美段落。

而且从萨克斯风演奏的角度讲，那几乎是他的“遗嘱式见证”。他在那张专辑上做的那些事简直难以置信，所以它在一种非常“本能”的层面上很有吸引力。那是极其美丽的音乐，同时也极其有力量。

他和 Dolphy 合作的那些东西又是另一种感觉。他和 Pharoah Sanders 的合作，以及那些非常“密”的作品，里面有很多人、每个人都在做很多事情。我坚持认为，在所有那些作品当中，你仍然能听见他的“异象”。至于其他人是否总能像他那样强有力地驾驭这种风格，有时候就值得商榷了。但说到他自己的演奏——而我也相信 Rashied Ali 在很多录音里也演得非常出色——

在他那里，一切都跟“追寻”有关。他一直在找新的东西。所以我认为所有那些作品都有价值。有些模仿他的人，我就不总是那么有耐心了，因为很多时候他们并没有他那样深厚的乐手功底或灵魂。他们只是跳上这趟“列车”，以为只要演自由爵士、前卫爵士，就能像 Train 一样。

当然，但我觉得那里面有很多值得去挖掘的东西。不过我还是会推荐《Interstellar Space》。继续问这种类型的问题吧。就是，那些问题最好都问他。

来，请继续。我也不确定你们想让哪位来回答这个问题。

你刚才说到他是一个“寻道者”，我很好奇，因为过去一周我多读了一些关于他的资料，试着更多了解他的灵性世界。我想知道你们怎么看待他在 1957 年那次经历之后，仍然继续在基督教以外寻索、尤其是他晚年那段时间的事情。好像那也跟你刚才讲到的那些音乐有关联。

他确实一直在探索很多不同的东西。我知道他花了很多时间在东方哲学上。老实说，我并不知道，因为我从来没有机会亲自跟他聊过这个话题——天啊，我真是太想能有五分钟跟他单独谈谈了，可惜没有机会。

你大概得去问他的家人，才能知道这方面有多深。就算是他的孩子们也未必能回答你得很全面，可能更多还是得问 Alice，如果你能问到她的话。是的，他确实一直在研究许多不同的东西，而且——

让我补充一点吧。今晚我试着为你们提出的那些洞见，主要是关于他对于“上帝之于灵性、之于音乐、之于整个生命”的重要性的看见。我不知道，也不觉得有人能够知道，他如果活得更久，最终会走到哪里去，因为他当时确实还在接触其他宗教。

我在事奉上的榜样——我在牧会上的英雄 CS 路易斯——虽然他是一位非常虔诚的基督徒，但他也认为，其他宗教里可能存在比有些基督徒愿意承认的更多恩典与光照。而 John Coltrane 对“上帝、音乐与灵性之间关系”的那些基本洞见，无论如何都是成立的，不会因为他继续探索其他宗教就被推翻。

但没错，他当时的确是在一条探索的路上。不幸的是，我相信他在真正理清许多问题之前就去世了。我们问题得左右轮流一下。谢谢你们今晚精彩的演出。我有一个问题，其实是想同时问你们两位的。

据我对 Coltrane 音乐与生命的了解，他是一个极其强烈、极其专注的人。演出间隙，他会出去继续练习，和其他音乐家一起，或者只是跟他们待在一起；某种意义上，他的音乐之所以变化那么大，正是因为他不断地练习，而且——

完全把自己奉献给音乐。所以我想问的是，作为一种形式，音乐和艺术本身，以及基督徒该如何与之相处。特别是，当你把生命中如此多的时间和强度都献给音乐时，音乐本身在多大程度上会变成你所敬拜的对象？而据我刚刚从你们的话里听到的，好像 Coltrane 后来是跨越了那条线，开始把音乐当作一种敬拜、当作向上帝敬拜的表达方式。

可我并不完全确定那条“平衡线”到底在哪儿——如果你把清醒的每一小时都花在练习上，好让自己能创作出某种东西——任何艺术形式都是如此——那这到底是你生命中的偶像，还是一种了不起的奉献，正好彰显了你对上帝的敬拜？

这是个非常好的问题。他在问：当你对自己的艺术——不论是音乐还是其他任何艺术——那样投入、那样操练的时候，这种投入在什么时候会变得模糊，什么时候会越界，变成你所敬拜的偶像？

我相信，只要你对自己诚实、对音乐与生命怀着热情，你就不得不面对这个课题。我没法替 Trane 回答，他是怎么处理的，我不知道。我知道的是，他一向以认真操练著称。比如，他会吹完自己的独奏，离开话筒，走到 Village Vanguard 的厨房里，在 McCoy 弹独奏的时候，他还在里面练琴。他几乎是在不停地练习。

每次他回到家门口——我认识那些去看过他的人——他脖子上总是挂着萨克斯风的背带。所以，我也知道，他同时也花了很多时间跟家人在一起。这些都很难说，因为我不在现场。

对我来说，这就是一个很大的挑战——我有妻子，我有两个女儿。你必须为家人留出时间。就我而言，因为我是个信徒，我必须为与主相交留出时间。我需要安静的时刻，需要用来研读的时间。我是个神学学生，我喜欢学习、喜欢阅读，我读很多书。

我真希望我可以说自己找到了完美的平衡，从来没有越界。但老实说，我做不到那样讲。

我只能说，我自己也在挣扎。好在我有一个很了不起的妻子，当我需要有人来“拽一下我的后襟”的时候，她总能优雅地做到这一点，帮我把眼光重新拉回到更宽广的人生图景上，而不是被那把小提琴、那把电贝司、那台钢琴或者作曲工作整个吞没。

不过我也想说，你在这方面也得小心。有些人会说：你知道的，当你在做音乐的时候，它可能会成为偶像，会挡住你与主之间的关系。可事实上，我感觉自己最靠近主的某些时刻，恰恰就是我拿着那件乐器在演奏的时候——在那里我能感受到祂的同在，感受到在那一两个小时里，我终于从自己生命的“驾驶座”上退到一边。

老实讲，有时候当我手里没有乐器的时候，我反而会拼命想把方向盘抢回来。所以反过来也可能成立：有时候，音乐正是神用来对你说：“你先让一让，让我来做工”的那个时刻。所以这是两面的。一方面你会在这事上挣扎，另一方面祂又在其中施怜悯，甚至在你追求音乐的过程中也帮助你成长。

John 刚才说的特别好，几乎是一个完美平衡的回答。其实我唯一能补充的是：这不只是音乐的问题。我有一段非常好的婚姻，而我一直对《奇异恩典》的作者约翰·牛顿的书信非常着迷。他也有一段极美的婚姻，他在信里写过，他一直在挣扎的一件事，就是不把自己的妻子变成偶像。

如果你的婚姻糟糕，那是一种苦难，是一个难处，是极大的属灵挑战；如果你有一段极美的婚姻，那也是一种“苦难”，那同样是巨大的属灵挑战——因为你总会倾向于把妻子说的话、妻子的爱，看得比上帝的爱更重要。

所以，这绝不只是音乐才会有的问题，我只是想让大家知道这一点。克尔凯郭尔说过，罪的本质，就是把我们的身份建构在上帝以外的任何事物上。

因此，罪的本质不是“做坏事”本身，而是把本来是好东西的事物，变成你生命中的“终极之物”。任何一个在音乐、在讲道、在婚姻上做得很出色的人，其实都是不断在这种偶像崇拜的边缘打滑，不停地“脚伸进水里”，然后又不得不回来。

我想，对几乎所有人来说，人生就是这样——你必须在那个张力之处活出你的生命。

据估计，我们大多数人会把将近一半的清醒时间花在工作上。那圣经的智慧如何应用到我们的职业上？换句话说，我们的工作怎样才能与上帝的工作连接？我们的“呼召”如何能变得更有意义？

在《万事都互相效力》（Every Good Endeavor）这本书里，Tim Keller 总结了他数十年来关于“职业与呼召”的教导，向你展示如何在服事上帝与他人的过程中，在你的工作里找到真正的喜乐。这本书提出了许多出人意料的洞见，说明从基督教的视角来看待工作，如何能成为一份兴旺事业和均衡个人生活的根基。

《万事都互相效力》是我们送给你的感谢礼物，感谢你为“福音与生活”事工奉献，使我们能够与世界各地更多的人分享基督的爱。只需访问 gospelandlife.com/give，也就是 gospelandlife.com/give。

好，我们回到右边这一边。你刚才讲到 John Coltrane 的音乐在很大程度上是他灵性生命的“溢出”。我想问的是，作为一个基督徒、又是一个艺术家，当你不太感觉到上帝的同在，或者根本没有什么感觉的时候，你会怎么做？

是啊，就是，你根本没有那种“感觉”。然后与此相关的是，我想，作为基督徒、作为艺术家，你需要“操练”。那你要怎么做，才能不让这种操练变成律法主义，或者只是枯燥的例行公事呢？

不好意思，最后那部分——你是说，怎么避免让“操练”变成一种律法主义，或者变成一种枯燥乏味的义务，尤其是跟音乐和练习有关的时候，对吗？

好，有一句话是我总会对学生们说的，我觉得那几乎是一个极大的真理。首先，你知道，我有很多时间是在和 Wayne Shorter 的乐队一起巡演中度过的。还有今晚你们听到的鼓手 Brian，他就像我的左右手，我们关系非常紧密。我可以告诉你，当我觉得自己正要陷入一种状态——比方说，我们到达一个演出场地，刚刚坐了两趟飞机、转了一次车，人都累瘫了——在那种时候，你唯一能对抗“这变成苦差事、变成例行公事”的方式，就是——

无论是你灵性上的枯干、这种枯干在音乐上也变成了一种干涸，还是你只是觉得毫无灵感，要走出这种状态，办法就是走出自己，不要一直往内看，而是睁开眼睛环顾四周。就在你身边还有别的人，总会有人做出一些让你受启发的事情。总会有人演奏出某些东西，让你开始用不一样的方式思考——只要你愿意向它敞开。

然后，突然之间，你就跑起来了——30 秒前你还累得不行、脑子一片空白，不知道该演什么，可某个人一演，你就“砰”地被点燃了。如果你愿意向外敞开的话。可一旦我们整个人都缩回到“啊不行，我得这样那样”“等会儿这个转调怎么办”“这个和弦怎么办”这样的状态里，我们就会像背上了个铅块一样，直直往下沉。

但若是我们愿意往自己之外看，发生的事就会很惊人。而这其实也是你人生的一个隐喻，你属灵生命的隐喻。上帝总是在邀请我们“向上看”，从祂那里领受，而不是自己死抓着方向盘，什么都要自己来，靠自己的行为，靠这个那个。如果我只要这样、那样，就会很棒——我们常常是这么想的。

所以你得走出那种“隧道视角”，那种封闭的、自我内卷的状态——那只会让你整个人塌进去。

这边。大概五年前“Directions in Music”巡演的时候，我看过你和一群人一起演出——我也想把这个问题问问 Brian——那次你和 Brecker、Hargrove、Herbie Hancock 等人同台。在 Michael Brecker 吹《Naima》之前，他讲了两三分钟，讲他拿到第一张 Coltrane 唱片时的故事。他说——我忘了当时是跟谁一起听的——他当时大概十三岁左右。他说，那张唱片一开始对他完全没意义，但后来又觉得里面听上去既充满情感、又高度聪明。

我原本还以为你刚才会多讲一点类似的事——你刚才提到你在九岁、十岁左右的经历——所以我也想问问，你第一次听到 Coltrane 是什么经历？

那一下子就打动你了吗？还是你当时的感觉是：“这人到底在搞什么，一堆音阶”？这些东西一开始是怎么在你心里变得“有意义”的？因为对很多人来说，第一次听到 Coltrane 是完全听不懂的。我自己是个爵士钢琴手，我第一次听到 Coltrane 的时候，心想：好吧，这音也太多了，我还是去听 Wynton Kelly 之类的吧。但后来你会慢慢越听越有味道。我只是很好奇，你第一次听他是什么感觉？你是被其他音乐家带着去听的吗？还是你自己误打误撞买到的？

我在努力回想我第一次听的是哪张唱片，可能是《Giant Steps》，那张里也有《Equinox》，是 Atlantic 公司出的。我得说，他音乐里的那种“情感”总是会先抓住我——在我还完全不懂他在和声与节奏上做什么之前，那情感就已经先打穿我了。

听 Wayne 的音乐也是这样。我第一次听到 Wayne 的音乐，大概是八岁的时候，听的是 Art Blakey 的那张《Mosaic》里《Children of the Night》那首。我根本不懂他们在干什么，但那个萨克斯的声音有一种撕裂般的特质，一种充满灵魂的呼喊，直接“砰”地打进我的里面。对我来说，Train 就是这样的。

《Giant Steps》那张唱片，对他来说在和声上其实是一份“宣言”，那又是一次他把自己这些年研究出来的东西摊开在世人面前的作品。就像 Billy Hart 说的，不论他吹的是一个音还是三千万个音，听起来总像是在吹一首抒情曲。里面总是有一种极其美丽、极其有灵性的力量在倾泻。

所以，在我真正听懂之前——《Giant Steps》就是一个很好例子——那张唱片里还有一首《Equinox》，节奏慢很多、很布鲁斯。我总是能听到一点东西——别忘了，他的外公是个牧师——那种讲道式的节奏一直在他的吹奏里。那种很接近“说话”的、像人声一样的表达，而次中音萨克斯本来就非常接近人的嗓音。所以在我还完全不懂的时候，那些东西早就抓住我了。可以说，它在我很小的时候就紧紧抓住了我。

这边。这问题其实把前面好几个问题都串起来了——关于 Coltrane 惊人投入地练习，比如有传闻说他曾经连着吹 C 大调音阶 11 个小时。我想知道，你觉得这对他在“工作与信仰”的态度上意味着什么？也就是说，他在严格到极致的练习操练，与他后来对灵性的委身之间，你怎么看这两者的关系？

哇。大家都听清楚这个问题了吗？

问题是：他怎样追求自己的艺术——通过练习、再练习——这对他的艺术本身带来了什么影响？他的这种审美追求与极致的练习，是不是一种“靠行为”的心态，好像只要这样练你就会变得很厉害？

我得说，当你重新定义了自己的乐器、成为像 Train 那样的大师级演奏家时，我认为他需要那样的操练，才能表达出他内心深处那些灵性情感的深度。我常拿这事跟学生们打趣——我最不爱听学生说“我就照着感觉演，我不用学这些东西”。

问题是，当你有那么多感受，却又因为手上做不出来而感到沮丧时，那才是真正的痛苦。

一个经典的例子是，有些人会把在音乐上的“天真”，甚至某种程度上的“不熟练”，抬举到一种被崇拜的位置，好像你懂得越多，就越不可能是真诚的；你只要知道太多，就不能“有感觉”地演奏。Coltrane 把这种误解彻底打得粉碎。这个世界上没有谁比他更有“灵魂”，也没有谁像他那样对自己的乐器有那么深的认识。

所以这在某种意义上把“靠行为”的想法推翻了。换句话说，他必须拥有那样的技术自由度，才能说出他要说的东西。而在我看来，这种技术从来没有失衡、没有被滥用；它从来不是为了“炫技而炫技”，而是整个人、整套技术都在服事一种大师级、充满灵魂的音乐表达。

以至于到今天，萨克斯演奏家们还在绞尽脑汁弄明白他到底做了些什么——他离世已经很久了，四十年了。你可以去问 Michael Brecker 这些当代萨克斯的“教父级人物”，他们都会告诉你，Train 仍然是他们的英雄。

我唯一能补充的是——很奇妙，这跟音乐以外的一切也高度相似。在职业生涯的起步阶段，我想几乎任何人都多少带着一种“靠行为称义”的味道，你拼命工作，因为——

你想要被接纳。但你常常会看到，有些人得到了自己想要的那份接纳、变得成功之后，还是在往前冲。我觉得那是因为，他们在某个时刻忽然意识到：现在我有了一个“异象”，我想把它表达出来。

对我来说，我当然更多是关心修辞和叙事。我现在常常感到挫败，因为我很清楚自己想说什么，却总觉得自己从未真正说到位。在我刚做传道人那会儿，我拼命工作，是因为我想让人喜欢我、接纳我。现在我知道自己被接纳了，我却真心想要讲出某些话，而除非我仍然拼命工作，否则我办不到。

我觉得 John 说得非常对。对于有些人来说，那种“我要证明给你看”的东西是永远不会消失的，你在某些音乐家身上总是听得出来——那永远围绕着“我”。

我们今晚的谈话其实不断在说，Coltrane 正是因为那次灵性觉醒，一举冲破了这一点。那之后，他做的事情不再围绕着他自己，不再是“靠行为称义”。而是他看见了一个异象、有了一个使命，他只是想要尽自己所能，把那件事做到最好。这恰恰是我们所有人都该追求的。

事实上，Miles 以前常对他说：“你为什么吹那么久？你就不能把萨克斯从嘴里拿出来吗？”而 Trane 的回答非常美，他一点也没有回怼，而是说：“我只是想要到达一个东西，我必须要到达那里。”他很谦卑，他觉得自己还没能真正触及那一点，所以才会吹那么长。

而我每次自己吹独奏也往往需要挺长时间，因为我也在试着找到那个东西。与此同时，我们其他人却巴不得自己也能像 Trane 那样“找东西”。我真希望我也能那样“寻找”一点点。因为，对他来说，那种所谓“还在摸索、还在挣扎”的演奏，已经比我们这些人能想象或梦到的一切高出八千万倍了。

好，我们继续，左右交替。

我知道今天仍然有很多在情感和灵性上都极其深刻的音乐。但如果你能谈一谈，我们在“主流文化对音乐的态度”上的转变……我常常有一种感觉，好像自己在回头抓取一些过去更伟大的东西。虽然我知道那份深度在今天依然存在——我们刚刚就听见了，今晚太美了——我只是很个人地希望，这种音乐可以更多一点。也许你可以从你成长的角度谈谈看法？

哇。所以你大致是在说，有时候我们会觉得过去的音乐里，那种更深层的连结更多；当我们听那些老唱片时，会听见一种纯粹，那种纯粹之所以吸引我们，是因为它跟市场营销、华尔街、律师谈合约等等完全无关，对吧？

是啊，我就生活在这样的世界里，我们所有人都是。Brian 和我经常谈这件事，Wayne Shorter 也常跟我们一起聊。我们很常觉得自己有一个使命，常常觉得自己是在“逆流而上”。但不管怎样，我们仍然觉得被迫、被催促着要继续走下去。

有时候这也需要勇气，因为唱片公司——就连在 Wayne 的乐队上——老实说，他们有时并不太看重我们做的事情。他们只想追逐最新一个“当红口味”。如果他们可以签一个流行歌手、多卖几百万张，那就是他们的优先次序。

你不能让这些东西把你变得苦毒，你要继续走在自己的使命上，要有纪律。因为如果你任由这些东西影响你，它会使你停下来。

对我来说，还有一层是：我觉得上帝给了我一些重要的东西，我必须继续去追寻。不管这些东西在唱片公司眼里流不流行、好不好卖，我真的不能去想那个。是的，我必须养家糊口——我也为此很努力——但一旦说到我的艺术、我的创作、我为自己录制的那些作品，我觉得自己在神和人面前都有一份责任，一定要尽最大的可能去做最诚实的音乐，用我所有的一切，以最真实的方式去触及人心，而不是去迎合今年的流行口味——因为那些口味每个月都在变。

这也是为什么像 Wayne Shorter 这样的音乐家如此重要——他从来没有妥协，从未停下脚步。这也是为什么当时的 Train 那么爱他，也一直与他同路。

谢谢。你好，刚才你提到，我们被自己的工作定义。我确实也觉得工作占据了我很多时间。可能是因为我并不真的是个音乐家吧，有时候我觉得工作反而把我从自己“属灵的那一面”拉开了。你能不能从你们的经验出发，给点指引：当你觉得好像跟自己都脱节了的时候，你们是如何回到当下、回到属灵这边来的？

也就是说，当你觉得自己跟属灵那一面断了线的时候，你是怎么回来的？

好，我简单一点说。我们可以说，人生里有“微观意义”和“宏观意义”之分。所谓“微观意义”，也可以说是你的“微观身份”——也就是，你是谁？在微观层面上，你会去看自己有哪些恩赐、你擅长什么，然后就去做那些事情。

那部电影《烈火战车》里有一句非常重要的台词——Eric Liddell 说：“神造我很会跑，而当我奔跑的时候，我感到祂的喜悦。”如果你跑得快，你就去跑；如果你是艺术家，你就去创作；如果你擅长做生意、促成交易，那你就去做最好的生意。当你在使用这些被赋予的恩赐时，你会有一种“我与这世界相契合”的感受——那就是那句台词的意思。

从基督徒的角度看，我们相信你的恩赐与才能并不是偶然的。它们不是随机发生的，而是上帝要你成为的样子——这就是你的“微观意义”。

但如果你没有“宏观意义”，问题就来了。所谓“宏观意义”，就是你是上帝的儿女，并且与你有一份关系。当我说“上帝的儿女”的时候，这是比较基督教式的理解。我自己有孩子，如果我的孩子中有人做得很好，我会为他感到非常骄傲，我的心会向他大大发出；如果孩子做得一团糟，把什么都搞砸了，我的心反而会更加、更加被他牵动。

换句话说，做一个父亲就是：不管我的孩子表现好不好，我始终爱他们，他们做的任何事都会牵动我的心。成为“上帝的儿女”就是：我知道自己在祂的恩典中，我经历过祂的恩典；祂以无条件的爱爱着我。知道这一点，就是你的“宏观意义”。

如果你没有这层“宏观意义”，那你的“微观意义”就会膨胀成你的“宏观意义”。这其实就是克尔凯郭尔在《致死的疾病》里讲的内容——当你的工作和恩赐变成你生命的全部意义时，你最终就会发现，正如托尔金那样，总觉得自己写不出心中那本真正想写的书；也如 Tim Keller 这样的传道人，总觉得自己从来没有讲出心里真正渴望的那篇讲道；John Patitucci 也总觉得自己从未把内心要表达的完全弹出来。

如果这些“工作与恩赐”就是你人生的全部，那你注定会一直不快乐。你总是——

你会一直觉得自己差一点，总是没有做到心里想做的。因此，你必须把自己的恩赐、使命、艺术和工作放进一颗更大的“钻戒底座”里——那个“底座”就是：你知道自己是上帝的儿女。没有这个前提，你的工作就会变成偶像，最后把你压垮。

所以，这两方面之间必须有一个平衡。我也认为，这是让许多人变得苦毒的原因：他们在挣扎，却只能看到眼前那一点点，不断伸手去抓某个东西，却怎么都抓不住。如果人生就只有这些，那作为艺术家的存在，确实挺难熬的——除非你有那份盼望。

好，虽然我们在左右来回切换，但我想这边这些朋友等得更久一点，就先请你。你好，我是两个爵士乐手的母亲，一个负责演奏，一个负责推广。我自己也在服事，常常凌晨三四点才坐地铁回家。我在你们身上看见那种热情，也在很多音乐家身上——包括我自己的儿子们——看到同样的东西，他们也都很有灵。

不过我想问你们俩的是：我曾听其中一个儿子对我说过，“我们不会主动走向你们，你们也不会主动走向我们”，意思是说，作为基督徒、作为信徒，在向这些人伸出手这件事上，我们彼此都做得不够。我很想知道，有没有什么方式——因为我真正渴望的，是能把 Brian 带到你面前，对你说：“Brian，我想让你认识一位相信耶稣基督的音乐家。”

你儿子也叫 Brian 吗？哦，好。还有 Andrew，对吗？好，把他们带来吧，带来见我们。

好，我会的。嗯，我现在眼睛里都含着泪，非常感谢你们俩。这对我意义重大。外面有太多人需要盼望、需要未来。而上帝恩待我，让我可以做自己热爱的事，并且去触及这些人——你们今晚分享的一切对我实在是巨大的激励。

谢谢你，谢谢你。谢谢，谢谢。请。

谢谢。我有个问题，不过跟音乐没什么关系。

哦，等等。我可不是对所有别的事情都懂行啊，我只懂音乐。

是这样的，我想主修理科，做一名老师，而且我也相信上帝。但其中一部分内容涉及“进化论”。如果我自己不相信进化论，却又在课堂上教它，那该怎么办？

好在，这个问题我可以用非常简短的方式来回应。

你在“进化论”上的具体看法，并不影响你是否持守“正统”的基督信仰。在进化论这个问题上，完全相信《使徒信经》、持守最传统教义的人，也可能有非常不同的观点。

所以，把某一种特定的进化论看法，当作“与正统基督教必须相配”的东西，是一种“红鲱鱼”式的干扰——就好像说：“如果我在进化论上的看法不对，那我就不能做一个正统基督徒。”——这根本不是事实。

我不打算在这里展开更多，只想强调一点：在进化论这个问题上，基督徒的观点横跨非常宽广的光谱。所以我总是跟人说：先搞清楚你在这件事上的看法——也就是：耶稣是不是上帝的儿子、是不是从死里复活？先把这个问题想清楚，因为它会改变一切。如果这件事是真的，那你就必须这样活；如果不是真的，你就不用这样活，你可以那样活。

这才是关键。别让“进化论”这个话题把你弄得分心。那个问题可以以后再说。我有许多非常扎实的基督徒朋友，他们在进化论上几乎持有整个光谱里各式各样的立场。所以，别让它成为绊脚石。

好，这边。

是，我只是好奇，想听听你对 Coltrane 早期与晚期独奏作品的一些看法。比如说，《Interstellar Space》之后的所有作品，和之前的所有作品做一个比较。我在听《Giant Steps》或《Interstellar Space》、以及那段时期的录音时，会觉得他那些新的观念、新的演奏风格，在那里显得更“成熟成形”；相比之下，他有些晚期的作品，好像在这方面就没那么明显。我一直在想，这会不会和他当时灵性生命里的某种“起伏”是平行的？

我很难形容，因为那是他极为个人化的一段旅程。我记得自己有时候会有这样的感觉：你知道，我有自己最喜欢的很多时期——我对 Train 有很多最爱的阶段，有时候那些“最晚期”的作品并不在我的“最爱”之列。常常是这样：我刚刚还觉得，自己听过一些最晚期的作品，没那么喜欢；结果某天听到一轨他吹中音萨克斯的录音，那是他极晚期的作品，一下子就把我击垮了，太不可思议了。那是和 Alice Coltrane 一起录的，鼓手也许是 Rashied，我甚至不记得那是张什么专辑。

我只觉得，你得去挖、去听。你不能只听一两遍就说：“嗯，我还是更喜欢《Giant Steps》。”因为那里面有太多东西，你得有耐心。

但对他的内心我没法代言，因为他当时真的在一条非常奇异、非常深的寻觅之路上，我没法说他当时是怎么想的。老实讲，我有一大堆 Coltrane 的唱片，一大堆。有时候我会有一阵子反复听他，然后又暂时离开一阵子，再回头的时候，他那些“最晚期”的作品并不是我首先会拿出来听的。

我可以追问一句吗？我只是想问，你在那些晚期作品里，仍然能听到他在“组织性”以及“技术上前进的方向”上，和早期一样的水平吗？

我认为，只要是他拿起萨克斯吹出来的东西——在他的一生当中——你总能听到那种“天才级别的组织结构”在运作。没有任何一张唱片会让你说：“这张没有。”那实在是太惊人了。

我们已经又聊了三十分钟，有些人可能开始觉得时间差不多该结束了。我想，因为你们在这边等得比较久，我们就再收一个问题，然后恐怕就要在这里告一段落了，大家抱歉。好，请发问——这边这位。

好，我的问题可能有点意外。当你们刚才讨论音乐的时候，我其实有种“听不太懂”的感觉。所以我想问的是：像我这样根本听不懂爵士的人，还有希望吗？能不能来一个三分钟的“给傻瓜的爵士入门”？

好，我有一个回答给你。人们常说：“我听不懂爵士。”我总是反问：“那你听得懂贝多芬或莫扎特吗？你能真正理解他们的天才吗？”可是即便你不能真正“理解”，你还是可以听那音乐、发出“哇”的感叹，对吧？你并不会觉得自己非要先弄懂什么，才可以听。你只是听，然后说：“哇。”

爵士也是一样。当你听 Coltrane 的音乐时，你不必完全听懂他在做什么——你可以只去听那里面的“情感层面”。你可以敞开去接受，也可以不接受——都行。

从里面得到情感上的触动。你不明白。

哦，明白了。别人听到某些曲子会听到哭出来，而我就是不懂。有些人不懂电脑，而我就是不懂爵士。

没关系，这真的没关系。我不能坐在这里跟你说，爵士音乐适合每一个灵魂。所以，你完全可以一边听他写的音乐，一边说：“哇，他在这里真的被上帝激发，在那一段也非常兴奋。”——对吗？

完全可以，完全没问题。太棒了，真好。

嗯，不过——

那对你来说是真实的，那就太好了。你知道是怎么回事，对吧？是的。也就是说，就算你听不懂也没关系。对我来说，那是一个紧紧抓住我的东西，我听他演奏会掉眼泪。

太好了。

对，他对我也是一样。我的偶像 CS 路易斯曾说，每个人心里都有一根“线”——一条隐秘的线——那是每个人独一无二的那根线：某些特定的东西会深深打动你，比如某种音乐、某部作品、某一片风景、某一个人、世界上某一个地方。

而我之前提到 Coltrane 的时候，还特别喜欢引用 Leonard Bernstein 的一句话。Bernstein 说，每当他听到《贝多芬第五交响曲》，即使他自认是个无神论者，他仍然会心想：“我不得不相信上帝。”

现在，每个人都有属于自己的那根线，只不过有些人的线并不经过爵士乐，这完全没问题。重要的是，那条线不是孤零零存在的——这就太好了。否则的话，我就没法在天堂里跟你作伴了，对吧？

每个人都有一根线，每个人都有。

再比如我自己，其实以前是吹小号的。可不管我怎么努力，就是没法真正演爵士。我就是做不到。哪怕曾经一度我的技术已经算不错了，但我就是做不到。

在我这里，情况有点像这样：我看着这些真的能演爵士的人，会有一种“敬畏感”，因为我曾经试过。我很欣赏爵士，欣赏得不浅，但我的欣赏可能跟你有点不一样，因为我是一个“失败的爵士乐手”。

也因此，我或许怀着一种你没有的敬畏。关键是：每个人都有那根线。对有些人来说，那根线一路穿过爵士的核心；对有些人来说，爵士占了很大一块；对另一些人来说，爵士几乎不是那条线的一部分。

像我妻子，她那根线几乎就跟爵士不怎么沾边。但另一方面，她那根线却是一路通往芭蕾的中心，对此我也只能“嗯——好吧”。

总之，每个人都有一根线，而这其实就是我们今晚一直在谈的东西。

听着，这位弟兄实在是口才极佳。而你们很多人也常常听我讲道。但今晚能有 John 在这里，实在是太美好了。

所以，让我们为 John 今晚来到这里，热烈鼓掌，表示感谢。谢谢你。谢谢大家今晚的到来。
