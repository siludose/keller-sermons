## English Transcript / 英文原文

today's podcast where Tim Keller explores the person and promises of Jesus  Christ. One verse and a place in the scripture that you usually don't read from on Christmas,  but it's a great Christmas verse. It's Romans 8.32. I'm just going to read one verse and I'll read it twice. It's not printed in the bulletin.

Everything else in the Bible is printed in the bulletin, but not Romans 8.32. And that's where Paul writes, he who did not spare his own son but gave him up for us all. How will he not also along with him graciously give us all things? He who did not spare his own son but gave him up for us all. How will he not also along with him graciously give us all things?

That's God's word. It's a Christmas time that we give gifts. In fact, it's the only holiday in which we do all this gift giving. It's the reason why retailers are so happy with Christmas in a way they're not happy  with 4th of July, for example, or Easter. You see, at the other holidays, we don't give gifts.

In fact, even at birthdays and weddings and anniversaries, we all give gifts to one, but  at Christmas, we all give gifts to all. Why do we do that? It's a great custom because what it does is it takes and you might say incarnates, it  acts out the central event of Christmas. The central event of Christmas is that Jesus Christ was not just born. Jesus is the one great person who wasn't simply born.

The teaching of the Scripture, the teaching of the Bible, of course, is that he had  an existence before he was born. Therefore, Jesus was not just born, he was given to us. He's the gift that Christmas is about. And you see what Paul says, he who did not spare his own son but gave him up for us all. How will he not also along with him graciously give us all things?

This is the one gift. If you have it, you have all the other gifts. That's what Paul's saying. This is the one gift. If you reject it, you lose all other gifts.

That's what Paul's saying. This is a theme of the Bible, you know, there are some other Christmas passages to talk about  this. For example, Isaiah, chapter 9, which of course the Messiah, it's one of the texts in which  the Messiah is based, four unto us, a child is born, unto us the Son is what? You heard it? Given.

The gift, John 3.16, God sort of the world that he gave, his only begotten Son. Here we have Paul saying, God did not spare his own son but gave him up for us all. And therefore, as Paul says elsewhere, Jesus Christ is the inexpressible gift. Inexpressible he says, thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift. Now, all I'd like to do tonight is I'd like to, in a sense, meditate on what that means.

Jesus has got many names, there's many metaphors used in the Bible to explain who he is. Because Jesus Christ is really like a diamond, you pick the diamond up a great diamond  and you turn it in the light and facet after facet hits your eyes and flashes at you. And you can go on and on forever and not see everything through every facet of a diamond,  you can see the whole. Every facet shows you every other facet through the one. Then you can turn it and then you can see that facet through another one.

Everyone shows you the whole only in a different way from another perspective. And to really see the glory of a great stone, you need to keep turning it and turning it. Now tonight, we'll just take a look at this. I would like to look at Jesus through this idea of him being a gift. What are the qualities of a gift?

What is a gift? What should a gift be? Now I'd like to just point out three things, just point out three things that gifts are,  and therefore Jesus is. And by thinking about Jesus as a gift, I think we'll come to understand better who he is  and how we should relate to him. Now first of all, now I'm not saying all gifts have these three qualities, but the best  gifts do.

And therefore what's essential to being a gift has a great deal to do with these three facets,  so these three qualities are traits. Number one, gifts are surprises, a good gift, the best gifts are unexpected. They're a surprise. Now it doesn't mean that all gifts have to be a surprise, and some great gifts sometimes  are not a surprise, but the power and the delight. The giftness of the gift is greatly enhanced when it's not, when something that surprises  you.

And of course, a surprise by definition is something you don't expect. And so the quintessential language of a person who's just had a great gift, has just experienced  a great gift. The quintessential language is, I didn't expect it. I wasn't even looking for it, but it's exactly what I need. That's it.

I didn't expect it. I wasn't looking for it. It wasn't on my end of my list, but now that I see it, of course, why didn't I want it? Why didn't I ask somebody for it? It's perfect.

Thank you so much. I mean, not only is it great to experience a gift like that, but it's great to give a gift  and have that experience, have the person who you've given the gift to have that experience. I didn't want it. I didn't expect it. I mean, I didn't look for it.

I didn't write it down, but now that I see it, it's exactly what I need and exactly what  I want. I submit to you that the way you can tell the difference between a Christian, a person  who's had a true, transforming experience of Christ, how you can tell that kind of person  from someone who's just a kind of, who just has formal religion, a person who's just characterized  by moral niceness and not by a transforming experience of Christ, is this very thing. Real Christians, people who've really experienced Christ in a vital way, always feel the same  way. There's been a watershed in their life. There's been a place in their experience they can look back to, it could be last week,  it could be last month, last year, last decade, but you know there was a time in which  you thought you knew all about Jesus, you really thought, but when you met Him, there's  a revolution in your understanding.

You might have been raised in church, you might have gone to sunny school all of your  life and so on. You thought you knew all about it. A Christian is always somebody who's had his or her understanding of Jesus revolutionized  because when Jesus actually shows up, when you actually meet Him, you say, this is not  at all what I expected. This is not at all what I wanted, and yet now that I have it, it's exactly what I  needed. Yes, Jesus is a gift, so He always is a surprise.

And the way you can tell you've met Him is you've been shocked, surprised. You know, your expectations shattered by Him. Has that happened to you? If it has not happened to you, if it's never happened to you, you have not even met Him. You haven't even rejected Him because you haven't rejected the real Jesus.

Let me just show you why the Bible says, in fact, it was read today and  one of the lessons at one of our services, He came to His own, but His own received Him  not. Many people accepted Him, but not many. When He was here on earth, remember not many. When He called all of His apostles and disciples and followers together to get together after  He was gone, they all got together in the upper room, there was only 120 of them. So by and large He was rejected, only a few really received Him.

Why? The answer is He did not meet the expectations of people who expected a Messiah, they expected  a certain kind of person. He came and He said, I'm the Messiah. Well, they had their expectations and He didn't meet those expectations. And the reason they missed Him was they refused to be surprised.

They refused. They refused to see Jesus as a gift. Messiah's a gift and the gift will always surprise you, will shatter your expectations. See, what did they expect? They expected a Messiah, but the Messiah had to be a political leader.

The Messiah had to be a person of power, a person with clout, a person who could really  get things done. Because you see, the people, His own, those people said, we're under the thumb, we're  under the boot of the Roman oppressor. We need someone who can get something done, who can get the boot off of us. And so, along comes Jesus. They expect the Messiah to say, those people are the problem, those people are the problem.

We're going to do something about it. Instead, the Messiah comes along and says, repent. Jesus comes out and says, repent. He refuses to become political. He refuses actually to, I mean, He's born as a helpless baby to a poor family in a backwater  part of the country.

He never gets any kind of the right connections. He never becomes an influential person, he just wanders around. And what does he say? If you read the Gospel, you'll see the summarization of everything that he taught while he was on  Earth was, repent. And everybody said, this is the Messiah, forget it.

This couldn't be the Messiah. This is supposed to be the one who's going to save us. The one who's going to deal with our problems couldn't be. And so, the only people that received Him were the people, those few, who are willing  to let their expectations be shattered. Who are willing to listen to Him and say, oh my, this isn't at all what I expected, but  He's exactly what I need.

Now, let me get real personal at this point. The average person, and plenty of you who are Christians know that you started out this  way too. Why did you start coming back to church? I mean, most people I meet in New York who are Christians or people who either never went  to church or else spent a lot of time away from it. Why did you ever start coming?

Why did you ever start seeking again? Why did you ever start reading and thinking? Because you were looking for the other kind of Messiah. You know, you say, my career is stalled, and I need someone with power who can break up  the log jam. Or here I am kind of lonely and I need a relationship, or I've got problems and I need  someone who will come in and do something for me.

There's problems in my life. There's people who have abused me, people who have oppressed me, people who have kept  me down. I haven't gotten promoted. I've got needs. I've got some.

I need a God who will come into my life and deal with those things. You're just like the people in that day that rejected him. They were looking for Messiah with power with clout. But here's what's so unexpected about the Messiah. Here's what's so unexpected about him.

Here's what shatters us. We all think our problems are due to the people out there. They're the ones. The have say, the have nots are the problem. They're unproductive and they're lawless and they're dragging us down.

And the have nots say the problem are the haves. They open doors for each other and get each other into the right clubs and the right  boardrooms and they won't share the power. They won't share the wealth. We're going to get it from them anyway. So everybody thinks there's somebody else.

Our problems is someone would deal with that group or those outside forces. Then things would be okay. But the Marilla Messiah always comes and says, repent. Which means the problems are not out there, they're in here. Your primary problem says the real Messiah is you, not them, you.

That the reason they rejected him the first time was they expected the Messiah, they expected  the Messiah to say, they're the problem. But the real Messiah came along and said, repent, you're the problem. Some years ago G.K. Chesterton, the great man of letters couldn't resist writing  into a particular prominent newspaper in Britain, the early part of the century that was  actually running a kind of series of essays and editorials asking various prominent people  to answer the question, what's wrong with the world today? The problem with the world is, and then they would write an essay, and each week some prominent  person would say, the problem of the world is this, the problem with the world is this,  the problem with the world is this.

It's a great idea for a series by the way. Bill Mewers will come up with it eventually, I think. You get a bunch of very, very important people and say the problem with the world is this. G.K. Chesterton couldn't resist, he wrote in, he was a Christian, he wrote in, a very  short letter, and he says, dear, you know, times.

The problem with the world is me, science and serily, G.K. Chesterton. And anyone who's met the real Messiah feels the same way. Anyone who's met the real Messiah knows that's the case. The real problem with your life and the real problem with the world is the selfishness  in your own heart.

It's the self-centeredness of your own heart, it's the flaws of your own heart. It's the self-deception of your own heart. It's your sin. Now, if there's anybody here who says, I want anything to do with that kind of talk that's  primitive and obscene, you know, that's old-fashioned, fine. You haven't met Jesus, that's all.

This is not my, what I'm saying. The real Messiah always comes through and shocks you and the difference between moral  nice people and real Christians. Christians are people who have met the real Jesus and he has revolutionized their understanding. He is not what they expected. If you today don't think that repentance is the thing you most need in your life, repentance.

If you don't know that, you haven't received the gift because a Christian is someone  who says, repent. Now years later, we say, I never thought of it, I never asked for it. It wasn't the gift I wanted, but now I see it's exactly what I need. Is that ever happened to you? Has there ever been this kind of change in your consciousness about the Messiah?

Have you seen that? See, if not, you haven't met him. That's all I'm trying to say. And by the way, it may mean that you haven't even reject the real one. Because the real Jesus Christ, no one is, if you have a kind of casual ho-hum relationship  to Jesus, if you say, well, I like a lot of the things he says, but it's hard to know all  about what he said.

If you have a casual relationship to him, if you read the Bible, you'll see that no one  ever did. And no one who ever met the real Jesus had a casual reaction. They either loved him and threw down their lives and did anything for him and followed him  or else they hated him and tried to kill him or they were scared of death and they wanted  to run away from him. And if you are not afraid of him or hate him or love him from your heart, you have never  met the real one anyway. You've never really seen what he claims.

You've never really seen what he does. He's a surprise because he's a gift. He's the inexpressible gift because he's surprised you. Secondly, and I'll be a little more brief on this, but I think it's fair to say, not  all gifts are like this, but I think we need at least touch on it. Secondly, in certain contexts, gifts can be insulting.

We said gifts are always surprising. Sometimes gifts are insulting. Well, it depends on the gift, you know. I'll tell you, let me give you a great example of where it might happen. You're going to get your paycheck and your employer has your paycheck, let's say.

He says, yes, here it is. Here's what we usually, you know, we always pay you every month or every two weeks. But I want you to know that this particular pay period, this is a gift. Here, Merry Christmas. And you know, that would be an insult.

Be an absolute insult because here you thought you were working. And if your employer says, Merry Christmas, this is a gift. What is she saying? What is he saying? I'll tell you what they're saying.

Your employer is trying to say, you didn't deserve this. Therefore, it's a gift. Now gifts can be insulting. Let me say, and let me suggest to you, that the gift of Jesus Christ is not only a surprise,  but it's always an insult, always. Because you see most people feel like they're trying their very best.

If you're a religious type, there's plenty of different folks that say, you know, if  I ask them, do you believe in heaven, yes, they say, well, why do you think you're going  to get there? You say, well, I'm trying. Well, how are you trying? I'm trying to be good. I'm trying to live a good life.

I'm trying to get there. I think I'm doing as well as many, many people. In fact, maybe doing better than most. Even if you're not religious, you have the same basic attitude. You say, I know that there's some kind of spiritual reality and I'm doing my best to honor  it.

I'm doing my best to reach it. I'm trying to be a loving person. I'm trying to be a good and kind and decent person. I'm trying my very best. The heart of the gospel is that you are mistaken, that you are self deceived, that the only  way anyone can reach God, the only way anyone can ever reach eternal life, the only way  anyone can ever connect with God is if it's a complete and sheer and utter gift.

You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger  brother. In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who  try to earn his love by being good. In his book, The prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart  of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental  older brother, and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal, extravagant grace. Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith, The prodigal God will help  you see a relationship with Christ in a whole new way. The prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel and life share  the hope and joy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the  world.

I tell you, I don't know why because I'm not much of a confrontor, really, but I used  to spend a lot of time in my first church back in Virginia. We had a lot of elderly people in the town, like a lot of small towns, a lot of elderly  people in our church, and I went to see a lot of people in their deathbeds, and what amazed  me, how often they would say they would be willing to say they were scared, and I would  say, what are you anxious about, and so often, so often, those folks would say, I don't  know, I don't know, I've tried my best, I've tried my best to be a good mother, I've tried  my best to be a good father, I've tried my best, you know, what they're saying is, I don't  know if I'm ready to die, I'm anxious about it, I think I've tried my best, I think I've  tried my best to be good, and I don't like to confront people, but I used to say back  then, I said, well, no one do your anxious, no one's ever done their best in neither of you. And that usually opened up into this whole theme, the Christian message, the heart of  the Christian message is salvation, whatever you want to call it, eternal life, whatever  you want to call it, spiritual reality, connection with God, connection with the divine, must  be a gift from God to you, it cannot be an attainment from you toward him, impossible.

That's the essence, and that is where Christianity diverges from every other religion,  every other religion. It says, you've never done your best, no wonder you're anxious, and you'll always be  anxious until you see the giftness of Jesus Christ, He's a gift. We talked about it this morning, you know, under a different heading, but it's good to mention  it again. People, so many people, are irritated with the only wayness of Christianity, irritated  by the fact that Jesus says, I am the way, the truth, and the life, no one comes to the  father but by me. And so people feel like, oh, that sounds too exclusive, and so people usually respond  by saying something like this, well, they said, yeah, that's how you Christians believe  I know, but I believe that anyone who is good, and anyone who is moral, and anyone who  is diligent, and anyone who is loving can reach God.

That sounds very open-minded, but not at all, it's very exclusive anyway. It's tremendously exclusive. What about those of us who are not good? What about those of us who are not able? What about those of us who are not disciplined?

What about those of us who are not wonderful in loving? And that's an awful lot of us. What about those of us who are a mess? You know, it sounds so wonderful to say, yes, you Christians say all you have to do is  you have to receive Christ, and then you connect with God. I believe that all good people can connect with God, fine.

What about those of us who are not? Look on it, that's exclusive to say that. What about us failures? You successes, you know? You people who know how to pull yourselves together emotionally.

You people who have got wonderful records of being kind and good fathers and good mothers  and good citizens, fine. What about the rest of us? You've cut us off because you don't believe that God and eternal life is a gift. Every religion and every philosophy says, here's how to reach God go do it. And Christianity stands completely apart and says no, it must be a gift.

So you have these verses like this, just to give you some examples. You have first Corinthians 1.30, but of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made  unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption. Boy, all those big words, you know what he's saying? That's Paul talking. It says, but of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who is made of God unto us to be wisdom and  righteousness.

Are you wise? See, what it means to be a Christian? Are you redeemed? Are you righteous? What does it mean to be a Christian?

It means when you unite to Christ, you're righteous in him. He is your righteousness. He is your performance. He is your record. Thank God we've finally got a religion that's not so exclusive that it's only for the good  people.

Thank God we've got a religion that's based on gift. And because it's based on gift, it's for anybody and anyone. Do you see? Jesus is a gift, but don't you understand? You've got to let yourself be insulted properly or you can't receive the gift.

What if your employer was standing there and saying, yes, here's your money, but let  me just tell you, considering the way you've been working the last month, this is nothing  but a gift. Mary Christmas, what could you do? I know what a lot of you would do. You would say, if that's how you feel about it, I don't want your bleeding charity. And that is how people walk away from Christianity all the time.

That's how people walk away from Christ all the time. You can't receive Jesus Christ unless you're willing to admit that you need Him. You can't receive unless you're willing to admit that you're not going to be able to  reach it, that you're not going to be able to be loving enough, that morality and goodness  is not enough that you're never going to be able to find God on your own. Don't you see? You've got to let yourself be insulted before you can receive it.

Has to be done. It's got to be done. You know, if you say, that's too easy, that's just too easy. You're telling me, years ago, years ago again, I remember in virtually a shack, a very,  very poor, small rundown shack and one of the worst parts of the little town where I was  a pastor and I sat down with a woman and tried to, I was a brand new minister too and I  tried to explain to her the giftedness of the gospel and she listened to me and she  said, let me get this straight. She says, if I lead a very good life, try my best, all my life to be good and to be nice  and to do my best, and I tried to explain to her, I said, give me a break.

Nobody does it. Well, she said, let me give you, if I do my best and I never feel that I really need Jesus  Christ as my Savior, I'll be cut off, but you're trying to tell me that some serial killer. You know, before he goes into the gas chamber, if from his heart, really from his heart,  he admits that there's no way he can reach God and he reaches out and takes hold by faith  of Jesus Christ, he will receive, you know, he will be ushered in. He will come into the family, he'll connect with God. I said, that's right.

She says, that's the most ridiculous religion I've ever heard. Jesus, what do you think I am? Uh-huh. See? Walking away from you.

God is there saying, you see your salary, this is a gift. The Bible says, the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life. If you refuse to take the check because your employer, in this case, God says, this is  a gift. If you say, keep your bleeding charity, you'll be cut off forever. Yeah, why?

Because you see, what if your employer's right? What makes you think that in your pride, she's wrong. In fact, what if you find that that's just the way you are and that every employer is  going to feel the same way about you? Eventually, don't you see? What if she's right?

What if God is right? What if even the best of us are not trying our best? What if the best of us are selfish? What if the best of us even when we do good deeds are doing them for ourselves? What if all of us really are trying to live our own lives, trying to be our own bosses,  trying to be masters of our own fates and captains of our own soul, and therefore all deserve  to be cut off unless we receive the free gift?

Jesus Christ died on the cross. Jesus Christ lived a perfect life in our place so that the just requirements of God, the  righteousness is fulfilled. And therefore, we can receive it as a gift. If somebody says, you know, this is all very, very, very doctrinal, I don't believe  any of this stuff. I don't need it.

But you do. You do. You yourself are trying to earn your way into something. You've all got your own righteousness, everyone in this room. Some of us get our righteousness, we get our sense of self-worth, our self-image out  of our accomplishments, our career, some out of relationships, some out of our control  over our bodies, some over how we look, there's all kinds of ways, but nobody can live without  finding something that is your righteousness.

And yet Paul says, before God, your righteousness is a filthy rag, only in Christ are you made  unto God, righteousness and wisdom and sanctification and redemption? Do you understand that Jesus is a gift? He's an insulting gift. Now, lastly, we said, Jesus is a gift, that means he's a surprise, as he surprised you. Jesus is a gift, and that means actually he's insulting, because you've got to see that  what he offers is a gift, it's not something you can earn.

But thirdly, lastly, Jesus Christ is immensely valuable, all gifts, really great gifts. You look at them, you know, the best gifts are the gifts that you look at and you say,  I never, ever would have bought this for myself. In fact, the best gifts are the ones in which you realize I never, ever could have bought  this for myself. I couldn't have afforded this. This is wonderful, you say.

Those are the best gifts. They're surprising, but they're also tremendously valuable and you look at them and the joy  just wells up the more you're able to appreciate, the more you're able to see the value of  it. What have you got in Jesus? You've got God with us. You have Emmanuel as you were singing.

You know, I wonder, think of it this way, the first person to ever ask for God to be with  him, to really be with him, was Moses. The first person to ask for Emmanuel, which is the Hebrew word that means God with us. Jesus Christ is God come to be with us, come near. Now the first person to ever ask for that was Moses, Moses. And he said, I don't want to lead the people into the promised land unless you come with  us, unless you be with us.

Now what did God do? I want your presence, said Moses. Now you know, modern people have no idea how valuable the presence of God is because we've  trivialized it. So you can't understand this, what a valuable gift it is because Moses said, I want your  presence. I want your face.

I want to be with you. Now what did God say to Moses? He said, of course, sure. Why? I'm always close to anyone.

You know, was God a sort of warm fuzzy? Did God like ET? Did he come around Moses and hug him and then say, put his finger on his forehead and  say, I'll be right here, I'll always be with you. You know, no. What did God say to Moses?

He says, I can't come with you, it'll kill you. I can't be with you, it will kill you. See, Moses understood the value of what we got at Christmas. Moses asked for the presence of God. Now modern people can't understand why God would say such a thing, they can't understand  it because they have no concept of the majesty of God, no concept of all.

People who have really gotten close to God have begun to move in, they begin to realize  how traumatic the presence of God is. His hugeness makes us feel little. His purity makes us feel dirty, his permanence makes us feel temporary, his depth makes us  feel shallow, and the closer we get to him, the more we see what a towering tower of purity  and power he is, the more traumatized we are. You know, some weeks ago, we talked about this, when human beings even get near moral human  moral excellence, relative, imperfect human moral excellence, we're threatened. I told you about a couple of weeks ago, a Christian cop who stopped taking bribes, but a Christian  businessman had started to actually report his income on his taxes.

About a Christian woman who was in a government agency and she started to really work very,  very hard in her department and around her and around the businessman and around the cop,  people got unbelievably threatened. Do you know how bad you're going to make us look? When we even get close to human moral excellence, imperfect human moral excellence, we're traumatized. What do you think it's like to actually dwell in the presence of the perfectly thrice holy God,  holy, holy, holy. See, Moses understood what he was asking for and Moses understood why God says,  it would kill you.

You can't. Do you understand this? And now let's shift forward to Christmas and suddenly you know what's given to us at Christmas? A baby. You know up until, if you go through the Bible, up until Christmas, the first Christmas,  what you have, whenever God appears visibly, they're called theophonies,  whenever God appears visibly, it's an incredibly intimidating form.

You have, he appears as a smoking furnace to Abraham. He appears as a burning tree, you know, blazing tree to Moses. He appears as a tornado to Job. He appears as a pillar of fire to the children of Israel. He appears as chicana brightness, glory coming down to the temple so nobody could even stand up,  intimidating, you see.

But suddenly he appears as an infant. An infant, you know, there is nothing more accessible than an infant. One of the great things about having an infant of your own is they're totally open to you. Absolutely open, you can always hug, you can always kiss. As soon as they get to be two, three, four, barriers start to go up.

They become their own persons, you know, and that's all very right. But for the purposes of the illustration, an infant is absolutely the most accessible thing possible. So accessible, so intimate, so completely open to you. God, this is what Christmas is about, the gift, God, this God,  the holy God, this God, with all of his boundless glory,  beauty beyond bearing, with unassailable majesty, this God has become an infant. How is that possible?

He became vulnerable so he could die on the cross, so the barriers between us could come down  so that we could actually have access to God, we could have him come into our life,  we could come into his presence, we could have God with us. You sang Emmanuel tonight. You talk about God with us, you sing about it, you know, in the Christmas carols. Do you know the value of this gift? If Moses was here, and he heard us singing about Emmanuel,  and then if he heard, or if he read in 2 Corinthians 3 where Paul says,  we are not like Moses, we are not like Moses.

Before Moses had to put a veil over his face, but in Christ the veil was taken away. For God made his light to shine into our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the  glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. And Moses would be jumping up and saying,  do you people understand the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, God with us,  the presence of God? Do you understand the value of the gift? Are you filling your mind with the value of the gift?

If you're bored tonight and you're a Christian, if you're having trouble with self-control tonight  and you're a Christian, if you're discouraged tonight and you're a Christian,  you have lost the sense of the value of the glorious thing that lives inside of you. Because Jesus Christ broke the barrier, when you receive Christ, you receive Christ,  He comes in, His nature, His power, His life comes in, His very presence comes in,  and slurs to slowly transform you. Have you lost sight of that? Jesus Christ is the most valuable gift of all, something you never could have afforded yourself. Do you know Jesus as the gift?

Thanks be to God for His inexpressible gift. Let's pray. Thank you, Father, that you are a God who enables us and allows us  to come into your presence as a gift. We pray that you would help us see that we can trust you. For if you did not spare your own son, how should we fail to trust you for everything else?

You're going to give us anything we need. So we pray, Lord, that you will help us to see  that in Jesus Christ we have all the gifts we need. And I pray that the words that we looked at  tonight and the teaching and the truths that we looked at tonight would be applied by your spirit  to every person here individually, that no one would leave without having a deeper understanding  and a desire to drink deep, to look even more deeply into the wonders of this inexpressible gift  Jesus Christ and whose name we pray. Amen. Again, it's all at gospelandlife.com.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today's podcast where Tim Keller explores the person and promises of Jesus  Christ. One verse and a place in the scripture that you usually don't read from on Christmas,  but it's a great Christmas verse. It's Romans 8.32. I'm just going to read one verse and I'll read it twice. It's not printed in the bulletin.

Everything else in the Bible is printed in the bulletin, but not Romans 8.32. And that's where Paul writes, he who did not spare his own son but gave him up for us all. How will he not also along with him graciously give us all things? He who did not spare his own son but gave him up for us all. How will he not also along with him graciously give us all things?

That's God's word. It's a Christmas time that we give gifts. In fact, it's the only holiday in which we do all this gift giving. It's the reason why retailers are so happy with Christmas in a way they're not happy  with 4th of July, for example, or Easter. You see, at the other holidays, we don't give gifts.

In fact, even at birthdays and weddings and anniversaries, we all give gifts to one, but  at Christmas, we all give gifts to all. Why do we do that? It's a great custom because what it does is it takes and you might say incarnates, it  acts out the central event of Christmas. The central event of Christmas is that Jesus Christ was not just born. Jesus is the one great person who wasn't simply born.

The teaching of the Scripture, the teaching of the Bible, of course, is that he had  an existence before he was born. Therefore, Jesus was not just born, he was given to us. He's the gift that Christmas is about. And you see what Paul says, he who did not spare his own son but gave him up for us all. How will he not also along with him graciously give us all things?

This is the one gift. If you have it, you have all the other gifts. That's what Paul's saying. This is the one gift. If you reject it, you lose all other gifts.

That's what Paul's saying. This is a theme of the Bible, you know, there are some other Christmas passages to talk about  this. For example, Isaiah, chapter 9, which of course the Messiah, it's one of the texts in which  the Messiah is based, four unto us, a child is born, unto us the Son is what? You heard it? Given.

The gift, John 3.16, God sort of the world that he gave, his only begotten Son. Here we have Paul saying, God did not spare his own son but gave him up for us all. And therefore, as Paul says elsewhere, Jesus Christ is the inexpressible gift. Inexpressible he says, thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift. Now, all I'd like to do tonight is I'd like to, in a sense, meditate on what that means.

Jesus has got many names, there's many metaphors used in the Bible to explain who he is. Because Jesus Christ is really like a diamond, you pick the diamond up a great diamond  and you turn it in the light and facet after facet hits your eyes and flashes at you. And you can go on and on forever and not see everything through every facet of a diamond,  you can see the whole. Every facet shows you every other facet through the one. Then you can turn it and then you can see that facet through another one.

Everyone shows you the whole only in a different way from another perspective. And to really see the glory of a great stone, you need to keep turning it and turning it. Now tonight, we'll just take a look at this. I would like to look at Jesus through this idea of him being a gift. What are the qualities of a gift?

What is a gift? What should a gift be? Now I'd like to just point out three things, just point out three things that gifts are,  and therefore Jesus is. And by thinking about Jesus as a gift, I think we'll come to understand better who he is  and how we should relate to him. Now first of all, now I'm not saying all gifts have these three qualities, but the best  gifts do.

And therefore what's essential to being a gift has a great deal to do with these three facets,  so these three qualities are traits. Number one, gifts are surprises, a good gift, the best gifts are unexpected. They're a surprise. Now it doesn't mean that all gifts have to be a surprise, and some great gifts sometimes  are not a surprise, but the power and the delight. The giftness of the gift is greatly enhanced when it's not, when something that surprises  you.

And of course, a surprise by definition is something you don't expect. And so the quintessential language of a person who's just had a great gift, has just experienced  a great gift. The quintessential language is, I didn't expect it. I wasn't even looking for it, but it's exactly what I need. That's it.

I didn't expect it. I wasn't looking for it. It wasn't on my end of my list, but now that I see it, of course, why didn't I want it? Why didn't I ask somebody for it? It's perfect.

Thank you so much. I mean, not only is it great to experience a gift like that, but it's great to give a gift  and have that experience, have the person who you've given the gift to have that experience. I didn't want it. I didn't expect it. I mean, I didn't look for it.

I didn't write it down, but now that I see it, it's exactly what I need and exactly what  I want. I submit to you that the way you can tell the difference between a Christian, a person  who's had a true, transforming experience of Christ, how you can tell that kind of person  from someone who's just a kind of, who just has formal religion, a person who's just characterized  by moral niceness and not by a transforming experience of Christ, is this very thing. Real Christians, people who've really experienced Christ in a vital way, always feel the same  way. There's been a watershed in their life. There's been a place in their experience they can look back to, it could be last week,  it could be last month, last year, last decade, but you know there was a time in which  you thought you knew all about Jesus, you really thought, but when you met Him, there's  a revolution in your understanding.

You might have been raised in church, you might have gone to sunny school all of your  life and so on. You thought you knew all about it. A Christian is always somebody who's had his or her understanding of Jesus revolutionized  because when Jesus actually shows up, when you actually meet Him, you say, this is not  at all what I expected. This is not at all what I wanted, and yet now that I have it, it's exactly what I  needed. Yes, Jesus is a gift, so He always is a surprise.

And the way you can tell you've met Him is you've been shocked, surprised. You know, your expectations shattered by Him. Has that happened to you? If it has not happened to you, if it's never happened to you, you have not even met Him. You haven't even rejected Him because you haven't rejected the real Jesus.

Let me just show you why the Bible says, in fact, it was read today and  one of the lessons at one of our services, He came to His own, but His own received Him  not. Many people accepted Him, but not many. When He was here on earth, remember not many. When He called all of His apostles and disciples and followers together to get together after  He was gone, they all got together in the upper room, there was only 120 of them. So by and large He was rejected, only a few really received Him.

Why? The answer is He did not meet the expectations of people who expected a Messiah, they expected  a certain kind of person. He came and He said, I'm the Messiah. Well, they had their expectations and He didn't meet those expectations. And the reason they missed Him was they refused to be surprised.

They refused. They refused to see Jesus as a gift. Messiah's a gift and the gift will always surprise you, will shatter your expectations. See, what did they expect? They expected a Messiah, but the Messiah had to be a political leader.

The Messiah had to be a person of power, a person with clout, a person who could really  get things done. Because you see, the people, His own, those people said, we're under the thumb, we're  under the boot of the Roman oppressor. We need someone who can get something done, who can get the boot off of us. And so, along comes Jesus. They expect the Messiah to say, those people are the problem, those people are the problem.

We're going to do something about it. Instead, the Messiah comes along and says, repent. Jesus comes out and says, repent. He refuses to become political. He refuses actually to, I mean, He's born as a helpless baby to a poor family in a backwater  part of the country.

He never gets any kind of the right connections. He never becomes an influential person, he just wanders around. And what does he say? If you read the Gospel, you'll see the summarization of everything that he taught while he was on  Earth was, repent. And everybody said, this is the Messiah, forget it.

This couldn't be the Messiah. This is supposed to be the one who's going to save us. The one who's going to deal with our problems couldn't be. And so, the only people that received Him were the people, those few, who are willing  to let their expectations be shattered. Who are willing to listen to Him and say, oh my, this isn't at all what I expected, but  He's exactly what I need.

Now, let me get real personal at this point. The average person, and plenty of you who are Christians know that you started out this  way too. Why did you start coming back to church? I mean, most people I meet in New York who are Christians or people who either never went  to church or else spent a lot of time away from it. Why did you ever start coming?

Why did you ever start seeking again? Why did you ever start reading and thinking? Because you were looking for the other kind of Messiah. You know, you say, my career is stalled, and I need someone with power who can break up  the log jam. Or here I am kind of lonely and I need a relationship, or I've got problems and I need  someone who will come in and do something for me.

There's problems in my life. There's people who have abused me, people who have oppressed me, people who have kept  me down. I haven't gotten promoted. I've got needs. I've got some.

I need a God who will come into my life and deal with those things. You're just like the people in that day that rejected him. They were looking for Messiah with power with clout. But here's what's so unexpected about the Messiah. Here's what's so unexpected about him.

Here's what shatters us. We all think our problems are due to the people out there. They're the ones. The have say, the have nots are the problem. They're unproductive and they're lawless and they're dragging us down.

And the have nots say the problem are the haves. They open doors for each other and get each other into the right clubs and the right  boardrooms and they won't share the power. They won't share the wealth. We're going to get it from them anyway. So everybody thinks there's somebody else.

Our problems is someone would deal with that group or those outside forces. Then things would be okay. But the Marilla Messiah always comes and says, repent. Which means the problems are not out there, they're in here. Your primary problem says the real Messiah is you, not them, you.

That the reason they rejected him the first time was they expected the Messiah, they expected  the Messiah to say, they're the problem. But the real Messiah came along and said, repent, you're the problem. Some years ago G.K. Chesterton, the great man of letters couldn't resist writing  into a particular prominent newspaper in Britain, the early part of the century that was  actually running a kind of series of essays and editorials asking various prominent people  to answer the question, what's wrong with the world today? The problem with the world is, and then they would write an essay, and each week some prominent  person would say, the problem of the world is this, the problem with the world is this,  the problem with the world is this.

It's a great idea for a series by the way. Bill Mewers will come up with it eventually, I think. You get a bunch of very, very important people and say the problem with the world is this. G.K. Chesterton couldn't resist, he wrote in, he was a Christian, he wrote in, a very  short letter, and he says, dear, you know, times.

The problem with the world is me, science and serily, G.K. Chesterton. And anyone who's met the real Messiah feels the same way. Anyone who's met the real Messiah knows that's the case. The real problem with your life and the real problem with the world is the selfishness  in your own heart.

It's the self-centeredness of your own heart, it's the flaws of your own heart. It's the self-deception of your own heart. It's your sin. Now, if there's anybody here who says, I want anything to do with that kind of talk that's  primitive and obscene, you know, that's old-fashioned, fine. You haven't met Jesus, that's all.

This is not my, what I'm saying. The real Messiah always comes through and shocks you and the difference between moral  nice people and real Christians. Christians are people who have met the real Jesus and he has revolutionized their understanding. He is not what they expected. If you today don't think that repentance is the thing you most need in your life, repentance.

If you don't know that, you haven't received the gift because a Christian is someone  who says, repent. Now years later, we say, I never thought of it, I never asked for it. It wasn't the gift I wanted, but now I see it's exactly what I need. Is that ever happened to you? Has there ever been this kind of change in your consciousness about the Messiah?

Have you seen that? See, if not, you haven't met him. That's all I'm trying to say. And by the way, it may mean that you haven't even reject the real one. Because the real Jesus Christ, no one is, if you have a kind of casual ho-hum relationship  to Jesus, if you say, well, I like a lot of the things he says, but it's hard to know all  about what he said.

If you have a casual relationship to him, if you read the Bible, you'll see that no one  ever did. And no one who ever met the real Jesus had a casual reaction. They either loved him and threw down their lives and did anything for him and followed him  or else they hated him and tried to kill him or they were scared of death and they wanted  to run away from him. And if you are not afraid of him or hate him or love him from your heart, you have never  met the real one anyway. You've never really seen what he claims.

You've never really seen what he does. He's a surprise because he's a gift. He's the inexpressible gift because he's surprised you. Secondly, and I'll be a little more brief on this, but I think it's fair to say, not  all gifts are like this, but I think we need at least touch on it. Secondly, in certain contexts, gifts can be insulting.

We said gifts are always surprising. Sometimes gifts are insulting. Well, it depends on the gift, you know. I'll tell you, let me give you a great example of where it might happen. You're going to get your paycheck and your employer has your paycheck, let's say.

He says, yes, here it is. Here's what we usually, you know, we always pay you every month or every two weeks. But I want you to know that this particular pay period, this is a gift. Here, Merry Christmas. And you know, that would be an insult.

Be an absolute insult because here you thought you were working. And if your employer says, Merry Christmas, this is a gift. What is she saying? What is he saying? I'll tell you what they're saying.

Your employer is trying to say, you didn't deserve this. Therefore, it's a gift. Now gifts can be insulting. Let me say, and let me suggest to you, that the gift of Jesus Christ is not only a surprise,  but it's always an insult, always. Because you see most people feel like they're trying their very best.

If you're a religious type, there's plenty of different folks that say, you know, if  I ask them, do you believe in heaven, yes, they say, well, why do you think you're going  to get there? You say, well, I'm trying. Well, how are you trying? I'm trying to be good. I'm trying to live a good life.

I'm trying to get there. I think I'm doing as well as many, many people. In fact, maybe doing better than most. Even if you're not religious, you have the same basic attitude. You say, I know that there's some kind of spiritual reality and I'm doing my best to honor  it.

I'm doing my best to reach it. I'm trying to be a loving person. I'm trying to be a good and kind and decent person. I'm trying my very best. The heart of the gospel is that you are mistaken, that you are self deceived, that the only  way anyone can reach God, the only way anyone can ever reach eternal life, the only way  anyone can ever connect with God is if it's a complete and sheer and utter gift.

You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger  brother. In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who  try to earn his love by being good. In his book, The prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart  of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental  older brother, and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal, extravagant grace. Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith, The prodigal God will help  you see a relationship with Christ in a whole new way. The prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel and life share  the hope and joy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the  world.

I tell you, I don't know why because I'm not much of a confrontor, really, but I used  to spend a lot of time in my first church back in Virginia. We had a lot of elderly people in the town, like a lot of small towns, a lot of elderly  people in our church, and I went to see a lot of people in their deathbeds, and what amazed  me, how often they would say they would be willing to say they were scared, and I would  say, what are you anxious about, and so often, so often, those folks would say, I don't  know, I don't know, I've tried my best, I've tried my best to be a good mother, I've tried  my best to be a good father, I've tried my best, you know, what they're saying is, I don't  know if I'm ready to die, I'm anxious about it, I think I've tried my best, I think I've  tried my best to be good, and I don't like to confront people, but I used to say back  then, I said, well, no one do your anxious, no one's ever done their best in neither of you. And that usually opened up into this whole theme, the Christian message, the heart of  the Christian message is salvation, whatever you want to call it, eternal life, whatever  you want to call it, spiritual reality, connection with God, connection with the divine, must  be a gift from God to you, it cannot be an attainment from you toward him, impossible.

That's the essence, and that is where Christianity diverges from every other religion,  every other religion. It says, you've never done your best, no wonder you're anxious, and you'll always be  anxious until you see the giftness of Jesus Christ, He's a gift. We talked about it this morning, you know, under a different heading, but it's good to mention  it again. People, so many people, are irritated with the only wayness of Christianity, irritated  by the fact that Jesus says, I am the way, the truth, and the life, no one comes to the  father but by me. And so people feel like, oh, that sounds too exclusive, and so people usually respond  by saying something like this, well, they said, yeah, that's how you Christians believe  I know, but I believe that anyone who is good, and anyone who is moral, and anyone who  is diligent, and anyone who is loving can reach God.

That sounds very open-minded, but not at all, it's very exclusive anyway. It's tremendously exclusive. What about those of us who are not good? What about those of us who are not able? What about those of us who are not disciplined?

What about those of us who are not wonderful in loving? And that's an awful lot of us. What about those of us who are a mess? You know, it sounds so wonderful to say, yes, you Christians say all you have to do is  you have to receive Christ, and then you connect with God. I believe that all good people can connect with God, fine.

What about those of us who are not? Look on it, that's exclusive to say that. What about us failures? You successes, you know? You people who know how to pull yourselves together emotionally.

You people who have got wonderful records of being kind and good fathers and good mothers  and good citizens, fine. What about the rest of us? You've cut us off because you don't believe that God and eternal life is a gift. Every religion and every philosophy says, here's how to reach God go do it. And Christianity stands completely apart and says no, it must be a gift.

So you have these verses like this, just to give you some examples. You have first Corinthians 1.30, but of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made  unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption. Boy, all those big words, you know what he's saying? That's Paul talking. It says, but of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who is made of God unto us to be wisdom and  righteousness.

Are you wise? See, what it means to be a Christian? Are you redeemed? Are you righteous? What does it mean to be a Christian?

It means when you unite to Christ, you're righteous in him. He is your righteousness. He is your performance. He is your record. Thank God we've finally got a religion that's not so exclusive that it's only for the good  people.

Thank God we've got a religion that's based on gift. And because it's based on gift, it's for anybody and anyone. Do you see? Jesus is a gift, but don't you understand? You've got to let yourself be insulted properly or you can't receive the gift.

What if your employer was standing there and saying, yes, here's your money, but let  me just tell you, considering the way you've been working the last month, this is nothing  but a gift. Mary Christmas, what could you do? I know what a lot of you would do. You would say, if that's how you feel about it, I don't want your bleeding charity. And that is how people walk away from Christianity all the time.

That's how people walk away from Christ all the time. You can't receive Jesus Christ unless you're willing to admit that you need Him. You can't receive unless you're willing to admit that you're not going to be able to  reach it, that you're not going to be able to be loving enough, that morality and goodness  is not enough that you're never going to be able to find God on your own. Don't you see? You've got to let yourself be insulted before you can receive it.

Has to be done. It's got to be done. You know, if you say, that's too easy, that's just too easy. You're telling me, years ago, years ago again, I remember in virtually a shack, a very,  very poor, small rundown shack and one of the worst parts of the little town where I was  a pastor and I sat down with a woman and tried to, I was a brand new minister too and I  tried to explain to her the giftedness of the gospel and she listened to me and she  said, let me get this straight. She says, if I lead a very good life, try my best, all my life to be good and to be nice  and to do my best, and I tried to explain to her, I said, give me a break.

Nobody does it. Well, she said, let me give you, if I do my best and I never feel that I really need Jesus  Christ as my Savior, I'll be cut off, but you're trying to tell me that some serial killer. You know, before he goes into the gas chamber, if from his heart, really from his heart,  he admits that there's no way he can reach God and he reaches out and takes hold by faith  of Jesus Christ, he will receive, you know, he will be ushered in. He will come into the family, he'll connect with God. I said, that's right.

She says, that's the most ridiculous religion I've ever heard. Jesus, what do you think I am? Uh-huh. See? Walking away from you.

God is there saying, you see your salary, this is a gift. The Bible says, the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life. If you refuse to take the check because your employer, in this case, God says, this is  a gift. If you say, keep your bleeding charity, you'll be cut off forever. Yeah, why?

Because you see, what if your employer's right? What makes you think that in your pride, she's wrong. In fact, what if you find that that's just the way you are and that every employer is  going to feel the same way about you? Eventually, don't you see? What if she's right?

What if God is right? What if even the best of us are not trying our best? What if the best of us are selfish? What if the best of us even when we do good deeds are doing them for ourselves? What if all of us really are trying to live our own lives, trying to be our own bosses,  trying to be masters of our own fates and captains of our own soul, and therefore all deserve  to be cut off unless we receive the free gift?

Jesus Christ died on the cross. Jesus Christ lived a perfect life in our place so that the just requirements of God, the  righteousness is fulfilled. And therefore, we can receive it as a gift. If somebody says, you know, this is all very, very, very doctrinal, I don't believe  any of this stuff. I don't need it.

But you do. You do. You yourself are trying to earn your way into something. You've all got your own righteousness, everyone in this room. Some of us get our righteousness, we get our sense of self-worth, our self-image out  of our accomplishments, our career, some out of relationships, some out of our control  over our bodies, some over how we look, there's all kinds of ways, but nobody can live without  finding something that is your righteousness.

And yet Paul says, before God, your righteousness is a filthy rag, only in Christ are you made  unto God, righteousness and wisdom and sanctification and redemption? Do you understand that Jesus is a gift? He's an insulting gift. Now, lastly, we said, Jesus is a gift, that means he's a surprise, as he surprised you. Jesus is a gift, and that means actually he's insulting, because you've got to see that  what he offers is a gift, it's not something you can earn.

But thirdly, lastly, Jesus Christ is immensely valuable, all gifts, really great gifts. You look at them, you know, the best gifts are the gifts that you look at and you say,  I never, ever would have bought this for myself. In fact, the best gifts are the ones in which you realize I never, ever could have bought  this for myself. I couldn't have afforded this. This is wonderful, you say.

Those are the best gifts. They're surprising, but they're also tremendously valuable and you look at them and the joy  just wells up the more you're able to appreciate, the more you're able to see the value of  it. What have you got in Jesus? You've got God with us. You have Emmanuel as you were singing.

You know, I wonder, think of it this way, the first person to ever ask for God to be with  him, to really be with him, was Moses. The first person to ask for Emmanuel, which is the Hebrew word that means God with us. Jesus Christ is God come to be with us, come near. Now the first person to ever ask for that was Moses, Moses. And he said, I don't want to lead the people into the promised land unless you come with  us, unless you be with us.

Now what did God do? I want your presence, said Moses. Now you know, modern people have no idea how valuable the presence of God is because we've  trivialized it. So you can't understand this, what a valuable gift it is because Moses said, I want your  presence. I want your face.

I want to be with you. Now what did God say to Moses? He said, of course, sure. Why? I'm always close to anyone.

You know, was God a sort of warm fuzzy? Did God like ET? Did he come around Moses and hug him and then say, put his finger on his forehead and  say, I'll be right here, I'll always be with you. You know, no. What did God say to Moses?

He says, I can't come with you, it'll kill you. I can't be with you, it will kill you. See, Moses understood the value of what we got at Christmas. Moses asked for the presence of God. Now modern people can't understand why God would say such a thing, they can't understand  it because they have no concept of the majesty of God, no concept of all.

People who have really gotten close to God have begun to move in, they begin to realize  how traumatic the presence of God is. His hugeness makes us feel little. His purity makes us feel dirty, his permanence makes us feel temporary, his depth makes us  feel shallow, and the closer we get to him, the more we see what a towering tower of purity  and power he is, the more traumatized we are. You know, some weeks ago, we talked about this, when human beings even get near moral human  moral excellence, relative, imperfect human moral excellence, we're threatened. I told you about a couple of weeks ago, a Christian cop who stopped taking bribes, but a Christian  businessman had started to actually report his income on his taxes.

About a Christian woman who was in a government agency and she started to really work very,  very hard in her department and around her and around the businessman and around the cop,  people got unbelievably threatened. Do you know how bad you're going to make us look? When we even get close to human moral excellence, imperfect human moral excellence, we're traumatized. What do you think it's like to actually dwell in the presence of the perfectly thrice holy God,  holy, holy, holy. See, Moses understood what he was asking for and Moses understood why God says,  it would kill you.

You can't. Do you understand this? And now let's shift forward to Christmas and suddenly you know what's given to us at Christmas? A baby. You know up until, if you go through the Bible, up until Christmas, the first Christmas,  what you have, whenever God appears visibly, they're called theophonies,  whenever God appears visibly, it's an incredibly intimidating form.

You have, he appears as a smoking furnace to Abraham. He appears as a burning tree, you know, blazing tree to Moses. He appears as a tornado to Job. He appears as a pillar of fire to the children of Israel. He appears as chicana brightness, glory coming down to the temple so nobody could even stand up,  intimidating, you see.

But suddenly he appears as an infant. An infant, you know, there is nothing more accessible than an infant. One of the great things about having an infant of your own is they're totally open to you. Absolutely open, you can always hug, you can always kiss. As soon as they get to be two, three, four, barriers start to go up.

They become their own persons, you know, and that's all very right. But for the purposes of the illustration, an infant is absolutely the most accessible thing possible. So accessible, so intimate, so completely open to you. God, this is what Christmas is about, the gift, God, this God,  the holy God, this God, with all of his boundless glory,  beauty beyond bearing, with unassailable majesty, this God has become an infant. How is that possible?

He became vulnerable so he could die on the cross, so the barriers between us could come down  so that we could actually have access to God, we could have him come into our life,  we could come into his presence, we could have God with us. You sang Emmanuel tonight. You talk about God with us, you sing about it, you know, in the Christmas carols. Do you know the value of this gift? If Moses was here, and he heard us singing about Emmanuel,  and then if he heard, or if he read in 2 Corinthians 3 where Paul says,  we are not like Moses, we are not like Moses.

Before Moses had to put a veil over his face, but in Christ the veil was taken away. For God made his light to shine into our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the  glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. And Moses would be jumping up and saying,  do you people understand the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, God with us,  the presence of God? Do you understand the value of the gift? Are you filling your mind with the value of the gift?

If you're bored tonight and you're a Christian, if you're having trouble with self-control tonight  and you're a Christian, if you're discouraged tonight and you're a Christian,  you have lost the sense of the value of the glorious thing that lives inside of you. Because Jesus Christ broke the barrier, when you receive Christ, you receive Christ,  He comes in, His nature, His power, His life comes in, His very presence comes in,  and slurs to slowly transform you. Have you lost sight of that? Jesus Christ is the most valuable gift of all, something you never could have afforded yourself. Do you know Jesus as the gift?

Thanks be to God for His inexpressible gift. Let's pray. Thank you, Father, that you are a God who enables us and allows us  to come into your presence as a gift. We pray that you would help us see that we can trust you. For if you did not spare your own son, how should we fail to trust you for everything else?

You're going to give us anything we need. So we pray, Lord, that you will help us to see  that in Jesus Christ we have all the gifts we need. And I pray that the words that we looked at  tonight and the teaching and the truths that we looked at tonight would be applied by your spirit  to every person here individually, that no one would leave without having a deeper understanding  and a desire to drink deep, to look even more deeply into the wonders of this inexpressible gift  Jesus Christ and whose name we pray. Amen. Again, it's all at gospelandlife.com.

### 中文翻译

### 引言：耶稣是谁？

耶稣是谁？圣经说他是完全的神，宇宙的创造者，同时又是完全的人。失去其中一个，你就失去了基督教。加入我们今天的播客，蒂姆·凯勒将探讨耶稣基督的人物和应许。

有一节经文和一个你通常不会在圣诞节读的经文出处，但它是一个很好的圣诞节经文。那是罗马书8:32。我只会读一节经文，我会读两次。它没有印在公告上。圣经中的其他一切都印在公告上，但不是罗马书8:32。保罗写道，**他既不爱惜自己的儿子为我们众人舍了，岂不也把万物和他一同白白地赐给我们吗？**

> "他既不爱惜自己的儿子为我们众人舍了，岂不也把万物和他一同白白地赐给我们吗？"

这是上帝的话。

### 耶稣的礼物

这是一个我们送礼物的圣诞节。事实上，这是我们进行所有这些送礼活动的唯一节日。这也是为什么零售商对圣诞节如此高兴的原因，而不是对例如7月4日或复活节感到高兴。你看，在其他节日，我们不送礼物。事实上，即使在生日、婚礼和周年纪念日，我们都只送礼物给一个人，但在圣诞节，我们都送礼物给所有人。我们为什么这样做？

这是一个伟大的习俗，因为它使圣诞节的核心事件具体化。圣诞节的核心事件是耶稣基督不仅仅是出生。耶稣是唯一一个不仅仅是出生的伟大人物。圣经的教导，当然是他在出生之前就有存在。因此，耶稣不仅仅是出生，他是被赐给我们的。他是圣诞节的礼物。

你看保罗怎么说，**他既不爱惜自己的儿子为我们众人舍了，岂不也把万物和他一同白白地赐给我们吗？** 这是唯一的礼物。如果你拥有它，你就拥有所有其他的礼物。这就是保罗所说的。这是唯一的礼物。如果你拒绝它，你就失去了所有其他的礼物。这就是保罗所说的。

### 礼物的特质

#### 惊喜

现在我想指出三件事，只是指出三件事，礼物是什么，因此耶稣是什么。通过把耶稣看作礼物，我想我们会更好地理解他是谁以及我们应该如何与他相处。

首先，我不是说所有的礼物都有这三个特质，但最好的礼物确实有。因此，作为礼物的本质与这三个方面有很大关系，所以这三个特质是特征。

1. **礼物是惊喜，一个好的礼物，最好的礼物是意想不到的。** 它们是一个惊喜。现在这并不意味着所有的礼物都必须是一个惊喜，有时一些伟大的礼物并不是一个惊喜，但礼物的力量和快乐在于它不是，当它是一个惊喜的时候。并且当然，惊喜的定义是你不期望的东西。

2. **一个刚刚经历过伟大礼物的人，刚刚体验过伟大礼物的人的典型语言是，我没有期望它。我甚至没有寻找它，但它正是我需要的。**

#### 侮辱

其次，在某些情况下，礼物可能是侮辱。我们说礼物总是令人惊讶的。有时礼物是侮辱。嗯，这取决于礼物，你知道。我告诉你，让我给你一个可能发生的好例子。你要去领工资，你的雇主有你的工资单，比如说。他说，是的，这里是。这是我们通常，你知道，我们每个月或每两周总是支付给你的。但我想让你知道，这个特定的支付期，这是一个礼物。这里，圣诞快乐。你知道，那将是一个侮辱。

#### 极其珍贵

最后，耶稣基督是极其珍贵的，所有的礼物，真正伟大的礼物。你看着它们，你知道，最好的礼物是你看着它们，你说，我从来没有想过会为自己买这个。事实上，最好的礼物是你意识到我从来没有想过会为自己买这个。我买不起这个。这太棒了，你说。那些是最好的礼物。它们是惊喜，但它们也非常有价值，你看着它们，快乐就涌上心头，越能欣赏它，越能看到它的价值。

你在耶稣身上得到了什么？你得到了与我们同在的上帝。你有以马内利，正如你在唱歌时所唱的。

> "感谢上帝赐下他那无法形容的礼物。"

让我们祷告。

感谢你，父亲，你是一个允许我们进入你面前的上帝。我们祈求你帮助我们看到我们可以信任你。因为如果你不爱惜自己的儿子，我们怎么能不信任你给我们其他一切呢？你会给我们任何我们需要的东西。所以我们祈求，主，你会帮助我们看到在耶稣基督里我们拥有所有我们需要的礼物。我祈求今晚我们所看的话语和教导以及我们所看的真理会被你的灵应用于这里的每一个人，没有人会离开而没有更深的理解和渴望深入，甚至更深入地了解这个无法形容的礼物耶稣基督，我们以他的名祷告。阿门。

## Chinese Transcript / 中文

今天的播客中，Tim Keller 将带领我们一同思想耶稣基督这位怎样的人，以及他向我们所发出的应许。

我要读一节经文，这节经文出自一段你平常圣诞节并不会翻开的经文处，但它却是极好的圣诞经文。这就是罗马书 8:32。我只读这一节，而且要读两遍。它并没有印在周报上。

圣经中其他经文都印在周报上，唯独没有罗马书 8:32。保罗在这里写道：

“神既不爱惜自己的儿子，为我们众人舍了，岂不也把万物和他一同白白地赐给我们吗？”

“神既不爱惜自己的儿子，为我们众人舍了，岂不也把万物和他一同白白地赐给我们吗？”

这就是神的话。

圣诞节是我们彼此送礼物的时节。事实上，这是唯一一个我们会大规模互赠礼物的节日。也正因如此，零售商在圣诞节会特别开心，而不会像对待独立日（7 月 4 日）或复活节那样。你看，在其他那些节日，我们并不会互相送礼。

其实，即便在生日、婚礼、纪念日，我们也只是众人给一人送礼；但在圣诞节，我们是人人给人人送礼。

为什么要这样做呢？这个传统很棒，因为它相当于把圣诞最核心的事件“具象化”——你也可以说是“道成肉身”地演出来。

圣诞节的中心事件是什么？就是：耶稣基督不只是“出生”而已。耶稣是历史上唯一一位并非只是“被生下来”的伟大人物。

按圣经的教导，按整本圣经的见证，他在降生之前就已经存在。因此，耶稣并非只是“出生”，而是“赐给”我们。祂就是圣诞节所围绕的那份礼物。

你看保罗怎么说：“神既不爱惜自己的儿子，为我们众人舍了，岂不也把万物和他一同白白地赐给我们吗？”

这是那唯一的礼物——如果你有了这份礼物，你就拥有了一切其他礼物；保罗就是在说这个。如果你拒绝这份礼物，你就失去了一切其他礼物；保罗也在说这个。

这是整本圣经的主题之一。还有其他一些关于圣诞的经文也在讲这同样的事。比如以赛亚书第 9 章——这是关于弥赛亚的关键经文之一，其中说到：“因有一婴孩为我们而生，有一子赐给我们。”你听见了吗？“赐给”。

那是礼物。约翰福音 3:16 也是如此：“神爱世人，甚至将他的独生子赐给他们。”在这里，保罗说：“神既不爱惜自己的儿子，为我们众人舍了。”所以，正如保罗在别处所说，耶稣基督是那“说不尽的恩赐”。他这样称呼耶稣——“说不尽的恩赐”，并说：“感谢神，因他无可言喻的恩赐。”

今晚我想做的，就是在某个意义上默想这句话到底意味着什么。

耶稣有许多名字，圣经里也用了很多比喻来解释他是谁。因为耶稣基督就好像一颗钻石，你把一颗上好的钻石拿在手里，在光线下缓缓转动，钻石一个又一个切面会折射出耀眼的光芒。

你可以不断转动，永远也看不尽每一个切面上的一切细节，但每一个切面都让你“看见整个钻石”；每一个切面都透过自己把整个钻石呈现给你。你可以再转一个角度，用另一个切面去透视前一个切面。每一个切面都展现同一颗钻石，只是角度不同。

要真正看见一颗大宝石的荣美，你需要不断地转动，不停地转动。

今晚，我们只做其中一次这样的转动。我想透过“礼物”这个角度来观看耶稣。礼物有什么特质？什么是礼物？一份理想的礼物应当是什么样子？

我想简单指出三点——三件关于“礼物”的事，也就是三件关于耶稣的事。通过按“礼物”的角度思想耶稣是谁，我相信我们会更明白他是谁，也更明白我们该如何与他相处。

首先，我并不是说所有礼物都一定具备这三点，但最好的礼物都有。而且，“成为礼物”的本质，很大程度上就与这三方面息息相关；这三点可以说是礼物的三个“切面”或特征。

第一，礼物是出人意料的。一个好礼物、最好的礼物，往往都是意想不到的，是一种“惊喜”。

当然，这并不意味着所有礼物都必须是惊喜；有时候很棒的礼物并非出其不意。但一份礼物之所以让人感到力量与喜悦，其“礼物感”会在惊喜的时候大大增强——当它是你没有预料到的东西时，这种感觉最明显。

而惊喜，按定义来说，就是你原本不曾预期的东西。

所以，一个刚刚收到一份极好礼物、真切经历到“礼物之美”的人，他最典型的话语会是：

“我完全没想到会收到这个。我根本没去找它，但它正是我需要的。”

就是这样：“我没想到。我没去找它。它根本不在我心愿清单的末尾，但现在我一看——当然啦，我怎么会没想到要它？我怎么没叫人送我这个？它太合适了。太感谢你了！”

不只是收到这种礼物的体验很美，送出这种礼物、看到对方有这样的反应，也是一件极为美好的事。

“我原本没想要它，我也没预料到它，我没有刻意去找、也没写在清单上，但现在我看见，它正是我需要、也是我想要的。”

我想向你提出：分辨一个人是不是真正的基督徒——是不是那个经历过基督真实改变的人——和一个只是有“形式宗教”、只是“道德上还算不错”、却没有被基督翻转的人，有一个非常关键的标志就在这里。

真正的基督徒，那些在生命深处真实经历过基督的人，总是有这样的感觉：

他们的人生中有一道“分水岭”；在他们的经历里，总能指向某个时刻——也许是上周，也许是上个月、去年，甚至十年前——但他们都知道，有那么一个时候，曾经自以为对耶稣了如指掌，自以为知道这一切；可是当他们真正遇见他的时候，他们的理解被彻底翻转。

你可能是从小在教会长大，主日学上了好多年，自以为全都懂。可是真正的基督徒，必定是那种对耶稣的认识被“革命性”更新过的人——因为当耶稣真正临到你，当你真正遇见他，你会说：

“这完全不是我所期待的。这完全不是我当初想要的，可是现在，当我得到了他，我才发现，这正是我真正需要的。”

是的，耶稣是礼物，所以他必然带来惊喜。

你怎么知道自己真的遇见了他？就是你的生命被他震撼、被他惊到，你的期待被他打碎。

这在你身上发生过吗？如果从未发生，如果你从来没有这样的“震惊”，那你其实还没有遇见他。你甚至连“拒绝他”都谈不上，因为你根本还没遇到那位真实的耶稣。

让我给你看一段圣经是怎么说的。事实上，今天在我们某一堂聚会的经文中也读到了——“他到自己的地方来，自己的人倒不接待他。”当然，也有一些人接待了他，但不多。

他在世上的时候，被多数人拒绝。当他在复活升天后，曾经召聚所有使徒、门徒、跟随者聚在一起；那时候大家都聚在一间楼房里，总共才 120 个人。所以总体上，他是被拒绝的，只有极少数人真正接待了他。

为什么？

答案是：他没有符合那些人对“弥赛亚”的期待。人们对弥赛亚有一套想象，他来了，却没有按着他们的想象行事。他说：“我是弥赛亚。”但人们已经有了自己的一套期望，而他并没有满足这些期望。

他们之所以错过他，是因为他们拒绝被“惊喜”所打破；他们拒绝把耶稣当作礼物。弥赛亚本该是礼物，而礼物总会出人意料，总会打破你的成见。

他们期待什么呢？他们期待的弥赛亚，必须是一个政治领袖，是有权力、有影响力的人，是一个“说到做到、能把事情做成”的人。

因为当时那些“自己的人”——就是他的同胞——都说：“我们被罗马人压在脚底下，我们需要一个能做事的人，一个能把那只靴子从我们身上挪开的领袖。”

所以当耶稣出现时，他们期待弥赛亚说：“问题在那群人，在那群人，我们要对付他们。”

然而真正的弥赛亚来了，却说：“你们要悔改。”

耶稣出来传道，说的却是：“你们要悔改。”

他拒绝把自己变成政治人物；事实上，他出生在一个贫寒家庭，是在乡下偏僻之地长大的婴孩。他从未攀上“正确的关系网”；他从未成为那种权势人物，他只是四处行走、传道。

他讲什么呢？如果你读福音书，会看到对他全部教导的总结就是一句话：“你们要悔改。”

于是人们说：“这也配叫弥赛亚？算了吧！这不可能是弥赛亚！这个人怎么会是要拯救我们的那位？怎么会是那位要解决我们问题的人？”

因此，唯一接待他的，只有那些愿意让自己的期望被打破的人，愿意听他说下去，并最终承认：“哦，我的天，这完全不是我原本期待的样子，但他却正是我所需要的。”

现在，让我更直接一点。

一般人——你们当中许多基督徒也清楚自己一开始就是这样——你一开始为什么会又回到教会？我在纽约遇到的大多数基督徒，要么就是从未去过教会，要么就是有很长一段时间完全离开教会。

那你为什么后来又开始来？为什么又开始“寻求”？为什么又开始读圣经、思考信仰？

因为你在寻找另一种弥赛亚。

你会说：“我的事业卡住了，我需要一个有能力的人来帮我打破僵局。”

或者你说：“我很孤单，我需要一段关系。”

又或者：“我有很多问题，我需要有人进到我的生命里，替我把这些问题处理掉。”

“我的生命里有很多问题，有人伤害过我，有人压迫过我，有人一直踩在我头上，我始终得不到升迁。我有好多需要。我需要一位神进入我的生命，替我处理这些事情。”

你就像当年那些拒绝他的群众一样——他们在寻找一位有权势、有资源的弥赛亚。

但真正的弥赛亚令人意想不到的地方在于哪里呢？他令人震撼的地方又在哪里？

就在于：我们都以为问题在“外面的人”。总是“他们”——有钱的人说：“问题在那些穷人，他们没生产力，没有法治观念，把社会拖下水。”穷人则说：“问题在那些有钱人，他们彼此打开门路，把彼此送进正确的俱乐部、董事会，却不肯分享权力，不肯分享财富，我们迟早要从他们身上拿回来。”

所以所有人都觉得问题是“别人”，如果有人能处理那一群人、那些外在力量，事情就会好起来。

但真正的弥赛亚总是会说：“你们要悔改。”

这意味着什么？意味着问题不在外面，而在里面。真正的弥赛亚说：“你的问题主要不在他们，而在你自己。”

他们第一次拒绝他，就是因为他们期待弥赛亚来时，会说：“问题在那群人。”

但真正的弥赛亚来了，却说：“你们要悔改，问题在你身上。”

多年前，有位大文豪 G.K. 切斯特顿忍不住给英国一家颇有影响力的报纸写了一封信。那大概是上世纪初的事，那家报纸当时正在刊登一系列专栏和社论，请各界名人回答一个问题：“今天的世界到底出了什么问题？”主题大概就是“世界的问题在于……”，然后每周就有一位名人写一篇文章，论证“世界的问题在于这个”、“世界的问题在于那个”。

这其实是个很棒的系列——也许哪天 Bill Moyers 也会想到做这样的节目。

你找一大堆非常重要的人，让他们说：“世界的问题在于……”。

切斯特顿是一位基督徒，他忍不住写了一封很短的信，说：

“亲爱的《时报》编辑：

今天世界的问题在于：我自己。

此致敬礼，

G.K. 切斯特顿。”

凡是遇见过真正弥赛亚的人，都会有同样的感受。凡是遇见过真正弥赛亚的人都知道，问题的根源在于你自己的心中的自私，在于你内心的自我中心，在于你心灵的缺陷，在于你内心的自欺——在于你的罪。

如果在座有人说：“我才不要听这种谈论罪的说法，太原始，太粗俗，太老土了。”那也可以——这只说明，你还没有遇见耶稣，仅此而已。这不是我个人的意见，而是圣经所启示的真实弥赛亚的光景。

真正的弥赛亚总是这样临到人，震撼人。道德上“还不错”的人，与真正的基督徒之间的差别，就在这里：真正的基督徒是那些遇见过真实的耶稣的人，而这位耶稣已经彻底翻转了他们对他、对自己的理解。他完全不是他们原本以为的那样。

如果今天你仍不认为“悔改”是你生命中最迫切需要的那件事；如果你不明白这一点，你就还没有真正接受这份礼物。因为基督徒，就是那种说：“我要悔改”的人。

多年以后，我们会回头说：“我从来没想到、从未要求过这样的礼物。这并不是我当初想要的礼物，但现在我明白，这恰恰正是我需要的。”

这样的意识转变，在你身上发生过吗？你对弥赛亚的认识曾经发生过这样的改变吗？你看到了吗？如果没有，那你还没有遇见他——我所说的仅此而已。

而且，这也可能意味着：你甚至还没有真正“拒绝”那位真实的耶稣。

因为如果你与耶稣之间只是那种“随随便便”的关系——你说：“嗯，我喜欢他讲的一些东西，但要完全搞懂他讲的所有东西确实很难。”——如果你只是这样一种若即若离的态度，那么只要你认真读福音书，你会发现，从来没有人这样对待真实的耶稣。

凡是遇见真实耶稣的人，没有一个是“无所谓”的。他们要么爱他、甘愿为他倾倒一生、跟随他到底；要么恨他、想要杀他；要么被他吓坏，想赶紧逃离他。

如果你既不怕他、也不恨他，也没有从心里爱他，那就说明你还从未真正遇见那位真实的耶稣。你还没有真正看见他到底宣称了什么、到底做了什么。

他是一份礼物，所以他是惊喜；他是一份“说不尽的恩赐”，因为他不断惊艳你。

今天的播客中，Tim Keller 将带领我们一同思想耶稣基督这位怎样的人，以及他向我们所发出的应许。

我要读一节经文，这节经文出自一段你平常圣诞节并不会翻开的经文处，但它却是极好的圣诞经文。这就是罗马书 8:32。我只读这一节，而且要读两遍。它并没有印在周报上。

圣经中其他经文都印在周报上，唯独没有罗马书 8:32。保罗在这里写道：

“神既不爱惜自己的儿子，为我们众人舍了，岂不也把万物和他一同白白地赐给我们吗？”

“神既不爱惜自己的儿子，为我们众人舍了，岂不也把万物和他一同白白地赐给我们吗？”

这就是神的话。

圣诞节是我们彼此送礼物的时节。事实上，这是唯一一个我们会大规模互赠礼物的节日。也正因如此，零售商在圣诞节会特别开心，而不会像对待独立日（7 月 4 日）或复活节那样。你看，在其他那些节日，我们并不会互相送礼。

赐给我们一子是什么？你听见了吗？赐给我们的。

这礼物，约翰福音3:16：“神爱世人，甚至将他的独生子赐给他们，叫一切信他的，不至灭亡，反得永生。”这里保罗说：“神既不爱惜自己的儿子为我们众人舍了……”因此，正如保罗在别处所说，耶稣基督是说不尽的恩赐；他说：“感谢神，因他有说不尽的恩赐！”今晚我只想做的，就是在某种意义上默想这是什么意思。

耶稣有许多名字，圣经里有许多比喻用来说明他是谁。因为耶稣基督就像一颗钻石，你拿起一颗大钻石在光中转动，它的一个又一个切面映入你眼中，向你闪耀。你可以一直转下去，却无法看尽钻石每一个切面所显出的全部；每一个切面都通过那一个向你呈现其他一切切面。然后你再一转，就能通过另一个切面看到那个切面。

每一个都以不同的方式，从不同的角度向你展示整体。要真正看见一块大宝石的荣耀，你需要不断地转动它、再转动它。今晚，我们就来看这一点。我想通过他是礼物这一观念来看耶稣。礼物有哪些特质？

什么是礼物？礼物应当是什么？我只想指出三件事，只指出礼物的三件事，因此耶稣也是如此。藉着把耶稣当作礼物来思想，我想我们会更明白他是谁，以及我们该如何与他相处。首先，我不是说所有礼物都有这三种特质，但最好的礼物有。

因此，作为礼物的本质与这三种切面有很大关系，这三种特质是这样的。第一，礼物是惊喜，好的礼物、最好的礼物是出乎意料的，是惊喜。现在这并不意味着所有礼物都必须是惊喜，有些很棒的礼物有时并不是惊喜，但礼物的力量与喜悦、礼物作为礼物的特性，会在它不是、在它是令你惊讶之物时大大增强。

当然，惊喜按定义就是你没有预期的东西。所以

一个刚收到大礼、刚经历一份大礼的人，他最典型的话就是：我没想到。我甚至没在找它，可它正是我需要的。就是这样。

我没想到。我没在找。它不在我的清单上，但现在我看见了，当然，为什么我不想要它呢？为什么我没跟人要它呢？它太完美了。

非常感谢。我是说，不仅自己经历这样的礼物很棒，去送一份礼物，让你送礼的人也有这样的经历，也很棒。我不想要它。我没想到它。我是说，我没在找它。

我没写下来，但现在我看见它，它正是我需要的，也是我想要的。我提出一个观点：你可以用这个来分辨一个基督徒——一个真正经历基督、被改变的人——与一个只是形式宗教的人，一个仅仅以道德良善为特征、而没有经历基督改变的人，就是在这一点上。真实的基督徒，真正以生命的方式经历过基督的人，总是有同样的感受。他们生命中有一个分水岭。有一个他们可以回望的经历点，可能是上周，可能是上个月、去年、上个十年，但你知道有一个时刻，你以为自己对耶稣都了解了，你真的以为，可当你遇见他时，你对他的理解发生了革命性的变化。

你可能在教会长大，你可能一生都在主日学里等等。你以为你都知道。基督徒总是一个对耶稣的理解被彻底翻转的人，因为当耶稣真的出现，当你真的遇见他时，你会说：这完全不是我所期待的。这完全不是我想要的，然而现在我有了他，他正是我所需要的。是的，耶稣是礼物，所以他总是惊喜。

而你能知道你遇见了他的方法，就是你被震惊了，被惊讶了。你知道，你的期待被他打碎了。有没有

那发生在你身上了吗？如果没有发生在你身上，如果从来没有发生过，你甚至还没有遇见他。你甚至没有拒绝他，因为你还没有拒绝真正的耶稣。

让我告诉你圣经为何说——事实上今天读过，我们一次聚会的经文之一——“他到自己的地方来，自己的人倒不接待他。”许多人接受了他，但并不多。他在地上时，记得吗，并不多。当他召集所有使徒、门徒、跟随者在他离开后聚在一起时，他们聚在楼上，只有一百二十人。所以总的来说他被拒绝了，只有少数人真正接待他。

为什么？答案是：他没有符合人们对弥赛亚的期待；他们期待某一种人。他来了，说我是弥赛亚。可是他们有他们的期待，他没有满足那些期待。他们错过他的原因是他们拒绝被惊喜。

他们拒绝。他们拒绝把耶稣当作礼物。弥赛亚是礼物，而礼物总会让你惊喜，会打碎你的期待。看，他们期待什么？他们期待一个弥赛亚，但弥赛亚必须是政治领袖。

弥赛亚必须是一个有权势的人，有影响力的人，一个能真正把事情做成的人。因为你看，那些人——他自己的人——说，我们在罗马压迫者的拇指下，在他们的靴子下。我们需要一个能把事情办成的人，能把靴子从我们身上拿开的。于是耶稣来了。他们期待弥赛亚会说，那些人是问题，那些人是问题。

我们要做点什么。相反，弥赛亚来了却说：悔改。耶稣出来说：悔改。他拒绝成为政治人物。他甚至拒绝……我是说，他作为一个无助的婴孩出生在一个贫穷的家庭，在一个偏僻的乡村。

他从未结识任何合适的关系，从未成为有影响力的人，只是四处游走。他说什么？如果你读福音书，你会看到他在地上所教导的一切的总纲是：悔改。于是人人都说，

这就是弥赛亚？算了吧。

这不可能是弥赛亚。这应该是要救我们的那一位。要解决我们问题的那位不可能是他。所以，唯一接待他的人，是那少数愿意让自己的期待被打碎的人，愿意听他并说：哦，我的天，这完全不是我所期待的，但他正是我所需要的。

现在让我在这里说得更个人一些。一般人——而且你们中许多基督徒也知道你们起初也是这样——你为什么开始回到教会？我是说，我在纽约遇到的大多数基督徒，要么从不去教会，要么离开教会很久。你为什么又开始来？

你为什么又开始寻求？你为什么开始阅读和思考？因为你在寻找另一种弥赛亚。你知道，你会说，我的事业停滞了，我需要一个有能力的人能打破僵局。或者我有点孤单，我需要一段关系；或者我有问题，我需要有人进来为我做点什么。

我生命里有问题。有一些人虐待我，有些人压迫我，有些人压住我。我没有升职。我有需要。我有一些。

我需要一位神进入我的生命，处理那些事。你就像当时那些拒绝他的人。他们在寻找一个有权势有影响力的弥赛亚。但弥赛亚最出人意料的是什么？他最出人意料的是什么？

这就是让我们震撼的地方。我们都以为我们的问题是外面那些人造成的。他们才是。既得者说，没得到的人是问题。他们不生产、无法无天，把我们拖垮。

而没得到的人说，有得到的人才是问题。他们互相开门，彼此引进正确的圈子、正确的董事会，他们不分享权力，不分享财富。我们无论如何也要从他们那里拿过来。所以每个人都觉得问题在别人。

我们的困难在于谁会去处理那个群体或那些外在的力量。

那样的话一切就会好。但真正的弥赛亚总是来并说：悔改。意思是，问题不在外面，而在里面。真正的弥赛亚说，你的首要问题是你，不是他们，是你。

他们第一次拒绝他，是因为他们期待弥赛亚，他们期待弥赛亚说：他们是问题。但真正的弥赛亚来了却说：悔改，你是问题。多年以前，文学巨匠G.K.切斯特顿忍不住写信给英国一家颇有名望的报纸。那时他们正在做一个系列文章和社论，邀请各界名人回答一个问题：今天世界出了什么问题？问题在于——然后他们写一篇文章，每周有一位名人说，世界的问题是这个，世界的问题是这个，世界的问题是这个。

顺便说，这是个很棒的系列点子。我想比尔·缪尔斯终会想出来的。你找一群非常重要的人，让他们说世界的问题是这个。G.K.切斯特顿忍不住写了一封信，他是基督徒，他写道，很短的一封信，他说，亲爱的先生们，

世界的问题是我。此致敬礼，G.K.切斯特顿。凡是遇见真正弥赛亚的人，都有同样的感受。凡是遇见真正弥赛亚的人都知道事实如此。你生命中真正的问题，以及世界真正的问题，是你心里的自私。

是你心里的自我中心，是你心里的缺陷，是你心里的自我欺骗，是你的罪。现在，如果这里有人说，我不想听这种话，那是原始而下流的，你知道，那是过时的，好吧。你还没有遇见耶稣，仅此而已。

这不是我说的。真正的弥赛亚总是来并使你震惊，道德上体面的人与真正基督徒之间的区别在于此。基督徒是遇见了真正的耶稣的人，他彻底翻转了他们的理解。他不是他们所期待的。如果你

今天如果你不认为悔改是你生命中最需要的事——悔改。

如果你不知道这一点，你就没有领受这个礼物，因为基督徒是一个说：悔改的人。多年以后，我们会说，我从未想到，我也从未求过。它不是我想要的礼物，但现在我看见它正是我所需要的。这曾发生在你身上吗？在你对弥赛亚的认识上，有没有发生过这样的改变？

你看见了吗？如果没有，你就没有遇见他。这就是我想说的。顺便说一句，这可能意味着你甚至还没有拒绝真正的那一位。因为真正的耶稣基督，如果你对他只是随意、平淡的关系，如果你说，我喜欢他讲的许多事，但很难知道他到底都说了什么。

如果你与他只是随意的关系，如果你读圣经，你会看到从来没有人这样。凡是遇见真正耶稣的人，都没有随意的反应。他们要么爱他、舍命、为他做任何事并跟随他，要么恨他、试图杀他，要么害怕得想逃离他。若你不怕他、不恨他，也不从心里爱他，你就从未遇见真正的他。你从未真正看见他所宣称的。

你从未真正看见他所做的。他是惊喜，因为他是礼物。他是说不尽的恩赐，因为他让你惊讶。第二点，我会稍微简短一些，但我认为可以这样说，不是所有礼物都如此，但我想至少要提一提。第二，在某些情境下，礼物可能是羞辱。

我们说礼物总是令人惊喜。有时礼物是羞辱。嗯，要看是哪种礼物。让我给你一个很好的例子说明会发生什么。你去领工资，你的雇主拿着你的工资，假设。

他说，是的，在这里。这是我们通常……你知道，我们每月或每两周都会付给你。但我要你知道，这个工资期，这是一份礼物。给你，圣诞快乐。你知道，那会是一种侮辱。

绝对是侮辱

因为你本以为自己是在工作。如果你的雇主说：圣诞快乐，这是礼物。他或她在说什么？我告诉你他们在说什么。

你的雇主是在说：你不配得这个。所以这是礼物。礼物会是羞辱。让我说，并让我向你建议，耶稣基督的礼物不仅是惊喜，而且总是羞辱，总是如此。因为你看，大多数人觉得自己已经尽了最大努力。

如果你是宗教型的，有很多人会说，你知道，如果我问他们你相信天堂吗，是的，他们说，那你为什么觉得你能去那里？你说，嗯，我在努力。那你怎么努力？我在努力做个好人。我在努力过一个好生活。

我在努力到达那里。我想我做得和很多很多人一样好。事实上，也许比大多数人做得更好。即便你不宗教，你也有同样的基本态度。你会说，我知道有某种属灵现实，我在尽力尊敬它。

我在尽力达到它。我在努力做个有爱的人。我在努力做个良善、善意、正派的人。我在尽我最大的努力。福音的核心是你错了，你在自我欺骗，任何人能到达神、任何人能得到永生、任何人能与神连接，唯一的方式就是完全、彻底、纯粹的礼物。

你可能知道浪子回头的故事，但它不只是关于一个迷途的弟弟。事实上，耶稣讲这个故事，是要对那些逃离神的人说，也是对那些试图靠好行为赚取他爱的人说。

在他的书《浪子的神》中，提姆·凯勒指出，这个广为人知的故事揭示了福音的核心：对叛逆的弟弟和论断的哥哥都是盼望的信息，也是邀请所有人去经历神那慷慨、奢侈的恩典。无论你是基督徒，还是仍在探索信仰，《浪子的神》都会帮助你以全新的方式看待与基督的关系。《浪子的神》是我们对你本月奉献、帮助“福音与生命”分享这

基督那恩典而不懈的爱所带来的盼望与喜乐，传给世界各地的人。

今天就到 gospelandlife.com/give 申请你的副本，就是 gospelandlife.com/give。没有人赚得它，没有人配得它。我告诉你，我不知道为什么，因为我其实不是个爱对质的人，但我在维吉尼亚的第一间教会里花了很多时间。我们镇上有许多老人，像很多小镇一样，我们教会里也有许多老人。我去看望很多临终的人，令我惊讶的是，他们常常会说他们很害怕，而我会问，你在焦虑什么？他们那么多次会说，我不知道，我不知道，我已经尽力了，我已经尽力当个好母亲，我已经尽力当个好父亲，我已经尽力了。你知道，他们在说的是，我不知道我是否准备好死，我对此很焦虑，我想我已经尽了最大努力，我想我已经尽力做个好人。我不喜欢对质，但那时我常说，我说，哦，不用担心，没有人尽过自己的最大努力，你们也一样。那通常会把话题带到这个主题：基督信息的中心——无论你称之为救恩、永生、属灵现实、与神连接、与神性连接——必须是从神赐给你的礼物，不能是你向他达成的成就，不可能。

这就是本质，也是基督教与其他一切宗教、所有宗教分道扬镳的地方。它说，你从未尽过你的最大努力，难怪你焦虑，直到你看见耶稣基督的礼物性，你才会不再焦虑。他是礼物。我们今天早上在另一个标题下谈过这个，但值得再提一次。人们，许多人，对基督教唯一性的说法很恼火，对耶稣说“我就是道路、真理、生命；若不借着我，没有人能到父那里去”这一事实很恼火。因此人们觉得，哦，这听起来太排他了，于是人们通常会回答说，

类似这样的话，他们会说，嗯，他们说，是啊，你们基督徒是这么信的我知道，但我相信任何良善的人、任何有道德的人、任何勤奋的人、任何有爱的人都能到达神。

听起来很开明，但一点也不，它还是非常排他，极其排他。那我们这些不良善的人怎么办？我们这些没有能力的人怎么办？我们这些不自律的人怎么办？

我们这些不那么美好、不那么有爱的人怎么办？那可是我们中的大多数。我们这些一团糟的人怎么办？你知道，说，好的，你们基督徒说你只要接受基督，就能与神连接。我相信所有好人都能与神连接，行。

那我们这些不是好人的怎么办？你想想，这样说是排他的。我们这些失败者怎么办？你们这些成功者，知道吗？你们这些懂得把情绪收拾好的人。

你们这些有很棒记录、是好父亲好母亲、好公民的人，行。那我们其余的人呢？你把我们切断了，因为你不相信神与永生是礼物。每一种宗教和每一种哲学都说，这是通往神的路，去做吧。而基督教完全不同，说不，它必须是礼物。

所以你有这样的经文，举几个例子。你有哥林多前书1:30：“但你们得在基督耶稣里是本乎神，神又使他成为我们的智慧、公义、圣洁、救赎。”哇，都是些大词，你知道他在说什么吗？那是保罗在说。他说：“但你们得在基督耶稣里……他成了我们的智慧和公义。”

你有智慧吗？你看，做基督徒是什么意思？你被救赎了吗？你有公义吗？做基督徒是什么意思？

意思是当你与基督联合，你在他里面就有公义。他就是你的公义。他就是你的表现。他就是你的记录。感谢神我们终于有一种不那么排他的宗教，不是只给好人预备的。

感谢神我们有一种基于礼物的宗教。因为它是基于礼物，

它是给任何人的。你明白吗？耶稣是礼物，但你不明白吗？你必须愿意被适当地羞辱，否则你无法领受这礼物。

如果你的雇主站在那里说，是的，这是你的钱，但让我告诉你，考虑到你上个月工作的方式，这不过是一份礼物。圣诞快乐，你能怎样？我知道你们很多人会怎样。你会说，如果你是这么看待的，我不要你那可恶的施舍。这就是人们一直离开基督教的方式。

这就是人们总是离开基督的方式。你不能领受耶稣基督，除非你愿意承认你需要他。你不能领受，除非你愿意承认你无法达到，你不可能足够有爱，道德和良善不够，你永远不能靠自己找到神。你明白吗？你必须先让自己被羞辱，才能领受它。

必须如此。必须这样。你知道，如果你说，那太容易了，那实在太容易了。你对我说，多年前，多年前我记得，在一个几乎像棚屋一样的地方，一个非常非常贫穷、破败的小棚屋，在我担任牧师的小镇最糟糕的地区之一，我坐下来和一位女士谈，试着——我还是个全新的传道人——试着向她解释福音的礼物性，她听了我，说，让我弄清楚。她说，如果我过一个非常好的生活，一生尽我所能做个好人、好人、尽我所能，我试着对她解释，我说，饶了我吧。

没人做得到。她又说，让我给你，如果我尽了最大努力，却从不觉得我真的需要耶稣基督作我的救主，我会被切断，可你却要告诉我，有个连环杀手。你知道，在他进毒气室之前，如果他从心里，真的从心里，承认他没有任何办法能到达神，并凭信心伸手抓住耶稣基督，他就会领受，你知道，他会被接纳。他会进入家中，他会与神连接。我

我说，对。

她说，这是我听过最荒唐的宗教。耶稣，你觉得我是谁？嗯哼。看见了吗？她就这样走开了。

神在那里说，你看到你的薪水了，这是礼物。圣经说：“因为罪的工价乃是死；惟有神的恩赐，在我们的主基督耶稣里，乃是永生。”如果你拒绝收下支票，因为你的雇主——在这个例子中是神——说，这是礼物。如果你说，留着你那可恶的施舍，你就会永远被切断。为什么？

因为你看，如果你的雇主是对的呢？你凭什么认为在你的骄傲里她是错的。事实上，如果你发现那正是你的样子，而且每个雇主都会对你有同样的看法呢？最终，你明白吗？如果她是对的呢？

如果神是对的呢？如果连我们中最好的人都没有尽到最好？如果连我们中最好的人也是自私的？如果连我们中最好的人即便做善事也是为自己而做？如果我们所有人其实都在试图过自己的生活，试图做自己生命的老板，试图作自己命运的主人、自己灵魂的船长，因此除非我们领受这免费的礼物，否则都该被切断？

耶稣基督死在十字架上。耶稣基督在我们的位置上过了完美的生活，使神公义的要求得以成全。因此，我们可以把它当作礼物领受。如果有人说，这一切都太、太、太教义了，我不信这些。我不需要它。

但你需要。你需要。你自己正在努力赚取某种东西。你们每个人都有自己的义，在这房间里的每一个人。我们中有些人的义、我们的自我价值感、我们的自我形象来自成就、来自事业，有些来自关系，有些来自对身体的控制，有些来自外貌，有各种各样的方法，但没有人可以不去寻找某样东西作为你的义而活。

然而保罗说，在神面前，你的义像污秽的衣服，只有在基督里你才成为神的义、智慧、圣洁和救赎。你明白耶稣是礼物吗？他是令人受辱的礼物。最后，我们说，耶稣是一个

礼物，这意味着他是惊喜，因为他让你惊讶。耶稣是礼物，这也意味着他令人受辱，因为你必须看见他所提供的是礼物，不是你能赚取的。

但第三，最后，耶稣基督极其宝贵，一切礼物，真正好的礼物。你看着它们，你知道，最好的礼物是你看着说：我绝不会为自己买这个。事实上，最好的礼物是你意识到：我绝不可能为自己买这个。我买不起。这太美了，你会说。

那些才是最好的礼物。它们是惊喜，但也极其宝贵，你看着它们，喜乐就涌出来；你越能欣赏，越能看见它的价值，喜乐就越涌出来。在耶稣里你得着什么？你得着“神与我们同在”。你拥有“以马内利”，就像你刚才唱的。

你知道，我在想，可以这样想，第一个请求神与他同在、真正与他同在的人，是摩西。第一个请求“以马内利”的人——“以马内利”是希伯来语，意思是“神与我们同在”。耶稣基督是神来与我们同在，来到我们身边。最早求这个的人就是摩西，摩西。他说，除非你与我们同在，否则我不愿带领百姓进入应许之地。

那么神怎么做？摩西说，我要你的同在。如今你知道，现代人不知道神的同在有多宝贵，因为我们把它淡化了。所以你无法理解这是多么宝贵的礼物，因为摩西说：我要你的同在，我要你的面。

我要与你同在。那么神对摩西说了什么？他说，当然，当然可以。为什么？我对任何人都很亲近。

你知道，神是那种温暖模糊的存在吗？神像ET吗？他围着摩西拥抱他，然后把手指放在他额头上说，我就在这里，我会一直与你同在。你知道，不是的。神对摩西说了什么？

他说，我不能与你同在，那会杀了你。我不能与你同在，会杀了你。你看，摩西理解我们在圣诞节得到的价值。摩西请求神的同在。如今的现代人不能

理解为什么神会这样说，他们无法理解，因为他们对神的威严没有概念，完全没有概念。

真正靠近过神的人开始进深，他们开始意识到神的同在有多么震撼。祂的浩大使我们觉得渺小；祂的纯洁使我们觉得污秽；祂的永恒使我们觉得短暂；祂的深邃使我们觉得浅薄；我们越靠近他，就越看见他是何等高耸的纯洁与大能之塔，我们就越被震撼。你知道，几周前我们谈过这个，当人类甚至接近道德上的人类卓越——相对的、不完全的人类道德卓越——我们就会感到威胁。我告诉你们几周前，一个基督徒警察停止收受贿赂，一个基督徒商人开始在税表上如实申报收入。

还有一位在政府机构里的基督徒妇女，她开始在她的部门里、周围非常非常努力地工作，而在那个商人、那个警察周围的人都觉得不可思议地受威胁。你知道你会让我们看起来多糟吗？当我们只是接近人类道德卓越——不完全的人类道德卓越——我们就被震撼。那你想想，真正住在那位完全、三重圣洁的神面前会怎样——圣哉，圣哉，圣哉。你看，摩西明白他在请求什么，摩西也明白为什么神说，这会杀了你。

你不能。你明白吗？现在让我们转到圣诞节，突然你知道圣诞节赐给我们的是什么？一个婴孩。你知道直到……如果你读圣经，直到圣诞节、第一個圣诞节之前，你所看到的，每当神可见地显现——称为神显——每当神可见地显现时，都是极其令人畏惧的形态。

他向亚伯拉罕显现为冒烟的火炉；他向摩西显现为燃烧的树，你知道，炽燃的树；他向约伯显现为龙卷风；他向以色列人显现为火柱；他显现为示迦拿的光辉，荣耀降临到圣殿，以致没人能站立，令人畏惧，你看。

但突然他显现为一个

婴孩。婴孩，你知道，没有什么比婴孩更容易亲近了。拥有一个婴孩最大的好处之一就是他们对你完全敞开。绝对敞开，你随时可以拥抱，随时可以亲吻。可是一到两三四岁，屏障就开始竖起来。

他们开始成为自己的个体，你知道，这都很正常。但就这个比喻而言，婴孩是最容易接近的事物。如此可亲，如此亲密，如此完全对你敞开。神，这就是圣诞节的意义，这礼物，神，这位圣洁的神，这位神，带着他无边的荣耀，超过人所能承受的美，带着不可撼动的尊严，这位神成了一个婴孩。这怎么可能？

他变得脆弱，好让他能死在十字架上，使我们之间的屏障能够拆毁，使我们真正能够接近神，使他进入我们的生命，使我们进入他的同在，使我们拥有“神与我们同在”。你今晚唱了以马内利。你谈论神与我们同在，你在圣诞颂歌里唱它。你知道这礼物的价值吗？如果摩西在这里，他听见我们唱以马内利，接着如果他听见——或者如果他读到哥林多后书三章，保罗说，我们不像摩西，我们不像摩西。

从前摩西必须用帕子蒙脸，但在基督里那帕子被挪去了。“那吩咐光从黑暗里照出来的神，已经照在我们心里，叫我们得知神荣耀的光，显在耶稣基督的面上。”摩西会跳起来说，你们这些人明白吗，神荣耀的光的知识，神与我们同在，神的同在？你们明白这礼物的价值吗？你们的心思是否被这礼物的价值充满？

如果你今晚感到无聊而你是基督徒，如果你今晚在自制上有困难而你是基督徒，如果你今晚灰心而你是基督徒，你已经失去了对那住在你里面的荣耀之事的价值感。因为耶稣基督打破了屏障，当你领受基督，你就领受基督，他进入你里面，他的性情、他的能力、他的生命进入你里面，他自己

的同在进来，并开始慢慢改变你。你是否已经看不见这一点了？耶稣基督是最有价值的礼物，是你永远无法自己负担的。你认识耶稣是礼物吗？

“感谢神，因他有说不尽的恩赐！”让我们祷告。父啊，感谢你，你是那位使我们、也允许我们以礼物的方式进入你同在的神。我们祈求你帮助我们看见我们可以信靠你。因为“神既不爱惜自己的儿子为我们众人舍了，岂不也把万物和他一同白白地赐给我们吗？”

你会赐给我们所需的一切。所以我们祷告，主啊，求你帮助我们看见，在耶稣基督里我们拥有一切所需的恩赐。我也祷告，今晚我们所看的话语、教导和真理，能被你的灵应用在这里每一个人身上，使没有人离开时不被更深地认识、也有更深的渴慕，去更深地饮取、去更深地凝视这说不尽恩赐的奇妙——耶稣基督；奉他的名祷告。阿们。再一次，一切都在 gospelandlife.com。
