## English Transcript / 英文原文

The scripture this morning is taken from the Book of Deuteronomy, chapter 30, verses 11-20. Now, what's I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach. It is not up in heaven so that you have to ask who will ascend to heaven to get it  and proclaim it to us so we may obey it. Nor is it beyond the sea so that you have to ask who will cross the sea to get it and  proclaim it to us so we may obey it. No.

The Word is very near you. It is in your mouth and in your heart. No. You may obey it. See I have set before you today life in prosperity, death and destruction.

For I command you today to love the Lord, your God, to walk in His ways and to keep His  commands, decrees, and laws, then you will live and increase. And the Lord, your God, will bless you in the land you are entering to possess. But if your heart turns away and you are not obedient, and if you are drawn away to bow  down to other gods and worship them, then I declare to you this day that you will certainly  be destroyed. You will not live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess. This day I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you, that I have set before you life  and death blessings and curses, now choose life so that you and your children may live and  that you may love the Lord, your God, listen to His voice and hold fast to Him.

So the Lord is your life, and He will give you many years. In the land He swore to give to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. This is the Word of the Lord. We've been looking at the book of Deuteronomy and we've said that this is a series of sermons  that Moses preached to his people right at the very end of his life, and now we really  truly are at the end of the series, and we're at the end of the last of his sermons. And in verse 16, we see that at the very, very end, he says, he's commanding, that word  command means he's calling or charging his people to enter into a covenant relationship  with God.

So the Lord, you are God and walk in His ways, and for the last couple of weeks been looking  at this, a covenant relationship with God is very personal yet binding and whole life  transforming. And here at the very end, Moses is simply saying, enter that covenant relationship with God. Now one of the most interesting things about this passage is its simplicity and its basicness. It's so basic, so straightforward. Choose.

Here's the one thing you can do. Do this. Don't do this. This will bring this. This will bring this.

So simple. In fact, it's so simple. I actually struggled a little bit with this. I still struggle with this passage, you know why? A preacher loves to take a hard passage and make it simple.

And everybody say, oh, it's simpler than I thought. He's wonderful. He says a wonderful teacher, okay. I actually believe that my job is to take an extremely simple passage today and actually  show you its difficulty. And I believe that's what Moses is trying to show us.

Moses starts saying, look, I'm offering you this personal relationship with God. And he's actually saying, it's not too difficult. It's near you. You don't have to go up to heaven. You don't have to go over the sea.

He's actually trying to say the simplicity of what I'm telling you is its difficulty. People miss this covenant relationship with God because it's so simple. The simplicity is its difficulty. And if you're ever going to get it, you need to come to grips with the difficult simplicity  of having a personal relationship with God. Now, let's look at this difficult simplicity under three headings.

We're going to see here, when it comes to this personal covenant relationship with God,  its deceptive ordinariness, its threatening graciousness, and its unimaginable promise. Its deceptiveness, its deceptive pardon me, ordinariness. Its threatening graciousness, and yet its unimaginable promise. So first, let's look at its ordinariness, which I said is deceptive. Verse 14 says, this word, this charge to enter into a personal relationship with God is near  you.

And then he says, what does that mean? Well, one of the ways to understand that is verse 12. He says, it is not up in heaven so that you have to say, who will ascend into heaven  and get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it. Now ancient cultures, all ancient peoples believe that divine wisdom, divine knowledge, secrets  of the universe, secrets of the meaning of life, secrets for how to live, secrets of  what happens after death. The secrets of the universe are hard to find things, because God or the gods are remote  and they hold their cards to their chests.

The ancient legends are filled with particularly gifted pure people who in body or spirit ascend  to the heavens, and they have visions, or they have visitors from other dimensions, and  they get cryptic oracular utterances and they piece together the truth that only they have. And Moses will have none of it. When he says, you don't have to go up to heaven to get this, what is he saying? He says because the God, with the whole book of Deuteronomy, says the God whom heaven and  highest heaven cannot even contain, has come down. He's come on down into Mount Sinai.

Over and over again, Moses says, God himself came down and told you these things and spoke  to you out of the fire, remember that? So what is Moses saying? If you want the secrets of the universe, you don't have to be an expert elite scientist. Nor do you have to be incredibly sophisticated, artiste poet. You don't only get it at an exclusive retreat in Aspen.

You don't have to climb a mountain to get it, you know why? It's in virtually every hotel room drawer. It's revealed in the Bible and the Bible is everywhere. It's the most accessible book, it's the most easy to get a hold of text, written thing  and print in the whole world. It's all over the place and not only, not only don't you have to climb up to heaven, not  only has it just come right down here and it's available everywhere and it's literally  right under your nose is the secret of the universe, it's under your noses.

You take a motel room, you take a hotel room, the secrets of the universe are in that hotel  room and you didn't even know it. It's so ordinary. But not only I think as Moses when he says it's near you means it's physically accessible. Here it is and my words, here it is and the book, here it is, but it's also intellectually  accessible because of course there's many things in the Bible that are difficult to understand  and we love to sit and figure out what they are but the things in the Bible says over  and over and over again, the court teachings of the Bible are unbelievably accessible. In fact let me give you a summary of the book of Deuteronomy which is all about how God wants  you to live and relate to him.

Here's a summary. Number one, love God and put his will ahead of your own. Two, love your neighbors unsilfcially and put their needs ahead of your own. In other words don't look out for number one but put God in your neighbor's first and  number three, you will find as a result. You will have so much of a richer life and a heart so much more full than it would  have been if you had held onto your heart and held onto your life and tried to fill it  yourself.

It's so simple, it's accessible, it's right there. Moses says you don't have to go up to heaven, it's right there, it's ordinary, everybody  knows it's all around you. It's in your hotel room, the secrets of the universe, now what's the problem? It's deceptive and it's deceptive in two ways. There are two ways, in fact, well for the only two kinds of people in the world it's deceptive.

First of all, there's people who don't believe or have trouble believing biblical faith,  they don't like it or they have trouble with it, they've got difficulties. One of the reasons is the deceptive simplicity. People who don't believe it very often are deceived by the simplicity, why? Well, guess what? Modern people have every bit the same problem that the ancients had.

We think if something's really, really important, some insights really important, it's got  to be brilliant and sophisticated and cutting edge, and new and sexy. Let me tell you, the Bible is not any of those things, but there's always something, but  boy I'll tell you, cautionary tale for me has been in September 9th, New York Times  city section just two weeks ago. There was an article about the last institute in Manhattan that trains psychiatrists in  psychoanalysis, Freudian psychoanalysis. The last institute, the trains, therapists in Freudian psychoanalysis, they were talking  about it, and they've mentioned that even just say 30 years ago, 40 years ago there  were dozens and dozens in Manhattan. One of the reasons I was so intrigued by that was because I know, when I got here like  20 years ago, and I would talk to New Yorkers who at the time were saying their 50s or 60s,  what they told me was that in the middle of the century, every New Yorker who was anybody,  anyone who was savvy, anyone who was with at all went to analysis two or three times a  week for years and years and years, and everybody knew this is it, this is how we're going  to get into our hearts, this is the whole issue, this is it, and if you don't understand  this, you're just out of it, and now it's dead, it's an eclipse, it is, you know, it  is so unsexy, and yet guess what, the gospel's on every street corner, but there's something  else coming, right?

Beware the deceptive simplicity of biblical faith. It really throws people who are having trouble believing it, but guess what, the simplicity  of our faith throws just as much those of us who do believe it. You look at it, well what is the heart of it? Well, you know, the heart of it is, you know, Carl Bart actually said it this way, Jesus  loves me this I know, for the Bible tells me so, there it is, or put it another way is  you're saved by God's grace, and the New Testament adds through the sacrifice of Christ, and  you look at that and you say, okay, I've heard that, I've heard that, I know it, I got it,  I got it, and it's so simple, almost nobody grasped the radical implications of it. Walter Brogiman wrote a commentary on Deuteronomy that I use, I've been using during this series  of sermons, and in what, on this passage where he sees the place where Moses says, this  word is not beyond you, it's near you, you know, it's simple, it's accessible, and  Brogiman, and that place in his commentary tells this fascinating story, true story, and  here's what he says, another illustration of how plain and simple God's word is, is  the account of the evangelical Christian community of Le Chambon in France during World War  2, that hid Jews during Nazi efforts at extermination.

The people of the mountain village, under the direction of evangelical church and pastor,  saved the lives of an estimated three to 5,000 Jews under circumstances extremely dangerous. The state of Israel 1990 recognized the entire village as righteous among the nations for  their remarkable compassion and bravery. So they must have been unusually courageous and noble and insightful, no? After the war, a Jewish adult who was kept alive there as a child returned and interviewed  his protectors about their reasons for taking such risky actions on his behalf, he was  trying to figure out, you know, what was the secret? To his surprise, one after the other all merely shrugged their shoulders, literally, and  said it seemed to be an obvious implication of their faith in Jesus.

They had no dramatic explanations, their actions stem from the very center of their embrace  of the gospel of the sacrificial love of Jesus, and it was enough. Now what Bergman's saying, and it's a powerful point, this account begs a question. The center of the core of the Christian faith, Jesus Christ gave his life, sacrifice his  life, to save, love, and forgive people who didn't believe in him, who were rejecting  him, right? So this little group of French evangelicals in this little mountain village said, well,  if Jesus did that for us, surely we should at least risk our lives to save these people  whether they believe like we do or not. Just a logical implication of what, of the basic Christian faith, the basic Christian  message, right?

Didn't everybody in Europe know the basic Christian message? Hasn't everybody in Europe seen crucifix? Hasn't everybody in Europe, you know, known the basic story? And why didn't they all do that? And the answer is, it's too simple for us.

So you think it's so simple, and it is so simple, but the implications are so vast,  and because we look and so, it's simple, we don't think out the implications, right? Dear friends, do not be deceived by the ordinaryness of what the Bible says about this subject,  not have a personal relationship with God. If you're exploring Christianity, please don't be offended by simplicity and its ordinaryness. And if you're a Christian and you say, oh, I understand the gospel, I get the gospel,  that just proves you don't. It's difficulty, it's simplicity, it's simplicity, it's difficulty.

And you really don't understand it until you really grasp that. Secondly, though, that's not all, that's part of this difficult simplicity. Secondly, there's a threatening graciousness to this. Now, you see, we said, when Moses says, this is near you, in the sense of you don't have  to go to heaven to get it, because it's revealed in the Bible. But now here's another thought.

He says, what I am commanding you today, verse 11, is not too difficult for you,  or beyond your reach, why? It is not beyond the sea so that you have to ask, who shall cross the sea to get it? Now, the sea is a little different metaphor in the ancient world. The sea was the symbol of chaos and destruction. In fact, Paul, we're going to get back to this, Paul quotes this whole passage in Romans 10.

But when he quotes the passage in Romans 10, he calls the sea the abyss. And of course, there's a couple of good movies, by the way. There's a good movie about the sea called the abyss. Because in ancient times, the sea was represented death, destruction. Sea fairers were far more vulnerable than people who were on land.

And so the sea represented the abyss and death. Now, what is Moses talking about here? He says, because ancient people and the ancient legends are filled with heroic noble figures  on a quest. And they go out on the sea. And the quest can be a number of things.

One of the great ones is Jason and the Argonauts. It's made in many bad, great movies. Just a great story about Jason goes off of the Argonauts and he's looking for a golden  fleece that is guarded by a dragon and he gets the golden fleece. But there's many perils. There's many riddles that he has to solve.

And many perils and he comes back and he gains the kingdom. And there are just an enormous number of these. It's almost all the cultures, all the ancient cultures, no matter where they have these strong  figures who go on these quests over the sea to gain a kingdom or eternal life. My favorite Hollywoodized version of all those ancient legends, and it's a really good  Hollywoodized version, is the third of the Indiana Jones movies. You remember where Indiana Jones and his archeologist father are after the holy grail.

And they believe that if they get the holy grail and you drink from it, you'll get eternal  life. And they have perils and there are clues just like all the other ancient, the movie makers  just understood all the other ancient pre-mythic histories. You remember what the clues were? First, the breath of God, only the penitent man will pass. See, every one of these reminds you of another special effect.

The word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth. And that's what all these stories are about. You want salvation? See, you want eternal life?

You want the kingdom? Clues, greatness, quest, over the sea. The leap, prove your worth, and Moses will have none of it. Instead he says, and this is what's so interesting, he says, it's not over the sea. You don't go over the sea to get it, what?

Then what is it? He says, it's in your mouth and in your heart. So your heart is where you believe, your mouth is what you confess, and what is he saying? He says, this relationship with God is not something you achieve, it's something you receive. It's not something that you prove your worth, you just get it.

And therefore he's talking, he's saying, that this relationship with God is not something  that you go to heaven to get, you go over the sea to get, you don't go on some kind of  quest, you don't have to be some heroic warrior, you receive it by grace. Now this is threatening, and this is our second problem we have with it. If you want a perfect example of this, and it's a great example, is the biblical story  of Naaman in 2 Kings chapter 5. In 2 Kings chapter 5 we're told about Naaman who was a Syrian general, and he was stricken  with leprosy, and he knew he was going to die if he wasn't healed, and he heard about  the God of Israel and his power. So he decided to go to Israel and find the prophet Elisha and seek his healing and salvation.

And the text tells us the way he's salad forth to do so, and what he brought with him  showed that he understood himself being on a quest. He went with gold and treasure to buy whatever and purchase whatever he had to. He went with a sword, ready to do a great deed because he was a man of prowess and valor. He went with letters of recommendation from his king, and so on, and he gets to the  prophet's house, and Elisha doesn't even come out. Instead he's told by the valet of Elisha, go wash in the Jordan River.

And a Naaman is furious, and he runs away in fury, and his servants go after them, and  they say, master, master, if you were told by the prophet to do some great deed, wouldn't  you have done it? And that's the point. He's like all people, all ancient people, all modern people. If there's salvation, we're going to achieve it, we have to prove our worth, we have to  leap from the lion's head, we have to bring out our sword, we have to do some great deed. He was expecting Elisha to come out and say, bring me the broomstick of the wicked witch  of the west.

And he would have been, he says, you see, here's what he's saying. He says, I'm a man of valor, I'm a man of wealth and means hard one. And it wouldn't be insulting to say, go get the broomstick of the wicked witch of the  west, get the golden fleece from the dragon, it wouldn't be wrong if you asked me to purchase  with my great wealth, my healing and my salvation, or to win it by slaying a dragon. But any idiot can wash in the Jordan River, any child can wash in the Jordan River. That kind of God has a bar of salvation so low.

You know, Kathy and I remember, the one was the first person I ever shared the gospel  faith with in our little town in Hope, Well, Virginia, where I first went as a 24-year-old  pastor. And it was a young, really hurting young mother on welfare, single mother. And I shared the gospel and she said, it can't be that easy. You know, same thing. That kind of God would have the bar of salvation so low.

But the answer is, on the one hand, we have a God so incredibly inclusive that you've  got grace, and that's a bar that anyone can step over, any murderer, any broken person,  anyone can step over the bar because it's a bar of grace, but it's actually not low. Demands and it requires that you lose your pride. Come on, Naaman, you say this is too low for me. No, you're not stepping over it, are you? Why not?

It's too high for you because there's two things that they offer a free grace, the graciousness  of this offer. There's two things that it demands you to give up. One is, you're right to look down on anybody else the rest of your life. You have to give up your pride. You have to give up forever.

You're right to look at anyone else and say, you don't understand, you rabble, you want  clean, you fools. You're the reason that things are the way they are in this country. He takes away forever the idea, the pride because you have to say, I'm just a sinner, I need  to be saved by grace. The other thing you have to give up is control of your life because you see if you had  salad forth, and if you had won your salvation with the kingdom or eternal life on a great  quest, then God couldn't just ask anything of you, you have your rights. You've done what you should be doing.

But if you out everything, everything, everything to His mercy, you owe Him everything. You can't call the shots in your life anymore, don't you see? The incredible inclusiveness at the same time, the threatening costliness of the free grace  of God, it is so simple, it is so easy that we can't take it, we're threatened by it. You see how this, see here's another aspect of this incredibly difficult simplicity. This threatening graciousness, our pride, because of our pride, the absolute graciousness  of the gospel throws us, don't let it throw you, but we're not done.

First aspect of this difficult simplicity is the deceptive ordinariness. The second aspect is the threatening graciousness, but the third aspect is the unimaginable  promise. What do I mean by that? You're smart people, this is New York, so if you're reading that passage, you realize  that I've been concentrating on the first part of the passage, which seems to be all about  grace. You don't have to go to heaven, you don't have to go over the sea, it's right there in  your mouth in your heart, you have to believe in your heart and confess with your mouth,  and it's there, it's right there, but then you get to the last part, and it seems like  the second part totally contradicts what was just said, because it says, you see, if your  heart turns away and you're not obedient, and if you're drawn away to bow down to other  gods and worship them, I declare to you this day you will certainly be destroyed.

You will not live long in the land. This day I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you that I have set before you life  and death, blessings and curses, choose life, or else all these curses will come upon  you. And wait a minute, we say, wait a minute, that seems like we're back to the quest thing,  we're back to going over the sea again. Because we've been through this, all the book of Deuteronomy, we see what we're supposed  to do, we see how we're supposed to live, we see how we're supposed to cheat God, we see  how we're supposed to treat everyone else, and we'll never live up to that all the time. We'll never live up to that all the time.

So it almost seems like the second part of this text poses a huge problem, it seems to  contradict the first part, but it doesn't. Because of the note, there is hope. You know what the hope is, it's in the very final verse, it's in the very, almost the final  word of Moses, where he says, for the Lord is your life. Let me tell you what's going on there, let me tell you what an incredible promise that  is, the first time in the Bible that that statement is made, and I think it's the last  time in the whole Old Testament. See up to now, life, and we're not talking about biological life, right?

Choose life. It's not biological life, so what are they saying? It's spiritual life, it's eternal life, it's the new heart and all that. Talked about that last week. So choose life.

Up until this point, life is connected with obedience, and death is connected with disobedience. If you obey, you'll get life, in other words, your obedience is your life. And if you disobey, you'll get death, in other words, your disobedience is your death. So choose life, so obey. And all the way through the book up to now, that's what it's been telling you, your obedience  is your life.

Every time this word life, the spiritual life thing comes up, it says, if you obey, you'll  get life, your obedience is your life, your obedience is your life. But verse 20, suddenly, suddenly, Moses basically says here, your obedience would be your life,  and it could be your life, but because it can't be your life, because you're not going  to keep it up, the Lord will be your life. What does that mean? Not that the Lord will give you life if you obey. That's not what it's saying.

It says the Lord will be your life, the Lord himself will be your life. What does that mean? Paul explains it in Romans 10. In Romans chapter 10, Paul comes to this very passage when he's proclaiming the gospel  of Jesus Christ to the readers of the book of Romans, to the Romans. He goes to this very passage and he interprets the passage in the most unbelievable way.

Here's what he says. This is Romans 10. Christ is the end of the law, says Paul, as a means of righteousness for everyone who believes. Now about this righteousness that comes through faith, Moses has said, quote, do not say in  your heart who will ascend into heaven, for that would bring Christ down. And he says, do not say who will descend into the deep, for that would bring Christ, that  would be to bring Christ up from the abyss, but what does it say?

What does Moses say? He says, the word is near you, it is in your mouth and in your heart, that is the word  of faith we are proclaiming, that if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe  in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Did you hear that? Look, first of all, he says, Christ is the end of the law, not period. He says, Christ is the end of the law for righteousness.

It's still there to please God, to change your life, but it's no longer a means to stand  before God, righteousness and accept it, don't I know? Why not? Jesus went into the abyss. Jesus went on the quest for eternal life. Moses says, Paul says, Moses says you don't have to go to heaven, no because Jesus has come  down from heaven.

Paul says, Moses says you don't have to go over to see because Jesus went into the depths  of the sea and he took the destructive forces and he received a destruction that we deserve. He took the curses in himself, he was destroyed. He went on a great quest, he went on the quest. He won eternal life and now he gives it to us as a gift, but I want you to know one thing. The quest of Jesus Christ was different than any other quest that's ever happened.

I read a scholarly article some years ago that really blew my socks off. It was amazing. First of all, it was a scholarly article. It was by a scholar who was actually trying to look and speak broadly about almost all  the ancient mythic prehistories of all the different cultures, whether Northern European  or Mediterranean, Greek and Roman or Asian, and they were looking at all these stories  and all these legends and they all had, there was a certain pattern to all of them. That was, you had these strong heroic figures who went on quests to win something.

They were all about that. All the legends were like that. Strong heroic figures who went on quests to win something and then the article amazingly  said this, the scholar of the last generation who knew the most in the entire world about  these ancient myths and legends, knew them in the originals and all that. The scholar of the last generation who knew most more about them than anybody else alive  was J.R. R.

Tolkien, who was an Oxford professor. This article said, secondly, he loved them so much that he wanted to write his own. He wanted to write his own mythic story about a quest and he did, but 0.3, he was so saturated  with Christianity and so saturated with the Christian gospel that his story is almost the  antithesis of every other mythic prehistory that ever happened. Because every single other ancient legend has a strong figure going off to save the world  by winning something. But in Tolkien and in the gospel, the world is saved by a weak figure who triumphs through  losing and goes off quest not to gain something but to lose something.

You see at the heart of history and at the heart of ours is a suffering servant who  triumphed through losing, who fell into the dark so we could live in the light. And that's the reason why Jesus quest is different than all these other self-saving, self-justifying  quests in all the other cultures. And that's the reason why there's one Christian poet Edward Chilato who addressing Jesus  spoke to him this way. The other gods were strong but thou was weak. They rode but thou just stumbled to your throne.

But to our wounds only God's wounds can speak and not a God has wounds but thou alone. The other gods were strong but thou was weak. They rode but you did stumble to your throne. You are wounds only God's wounds can speak and there's no God in any of the religion  that has wounds but thou alone. The simplicity is the difficulties, let me close like this.

If you are exploring Christianity or if you have maybe come to, you know, you may be  erased in a church and now you're trying to think, well, what's my relationship to Christianity? Tell my word, please realize that in some ways understand the difficulty of the simplicity  and grasping the simplicity in all of its difficulty is how you become a Christian. You want to know how to become a Christian? You want to know how to get a covenant relationship with God? That's it.

You say, well, that's paradoxical. What do you mean? Give me a perfect case study. In 1740s, there were a group of young men who were actually all part of the church. In fact, I think some of them were ordained ministers.

They were in the Church of England and they were in London but they knew there was something  missing. They knew they didn't have a personal relationship with God. They didn't have a covenant relationship with God. They didn't have a new heart. They began a set of evening meetings in which they read to each other Luther's preface to  the Galatians, Martin Luther's preface to the book of the Galatians.

On successive nights over a period of a week or so, John Wesley, founder of the Methodist  Church, Charles Wesley, great hymn writer and his brother and a whole lot of their friends  got converted. When the penny dropped of the simplicity of the grace of God, here's one of the men  named William Holland that you wouldn't have heard of, but it's a perfect example of  what happened. This is his diary. Mr. Charles Wesley read aloud and at the place where Luther said, what have we then  nothing to do?

No, nothing. But only to accept him who of God is made unto us who becomes for us, our wisdom, our  righteousness, our sanctification, our redemption. And adhering those words, there came such a power over me as I cannot well imagine my  end described. My heart was so filled with peace and love that I burst into tears and went afterwards  I went into the street. I could scarcely feel the ground I trot upon.

Now what happened was the simplicity of grace hit him. And the moment that happened, and the moment he was willing to pay those to cost, to get  rid of your pride, to say from now on, I'll never be able to look down at anybody, and  to get rid of any control of your life, because now you know you owe him everything, everything  to his mercy. If you're willing to pay those prices and the simplicity of grace happens at that moment  you are becoming a Christian, at that moment you are entering into that personal relationship  with God. And you say, well, if, what if I already believe? You have a final word for me, sure.

The life, the life that's in you. God is your life. Because of Jesus, he's your life now. It's guaranteed. It's in you.

That's why Colossians 3, Paul says, and 1 John 3, they talks about our life is hid with  God. Our life is in God. And we really don't even know what we're going to be. And when Jesus Christ is revealed on the last day, we know we'll be like Him. I mean, it's over the top.

The life that started in you is just a sea. You're just a shadow of what you're going to be. See us Lewis describes though what you are going to be. Live in hope of this. He will make the feeblest and filthiest of us into dazzling radiant immortal creatures, pulsating  through with an energy, joy, wisdom and love as we cannot now imagine.

He can make us all bright, stainless mirrors which reflect back to God perfectly though on  a smaller scale, his own boundless power, delight and goodness. That is what we are in for. Nothing less. Let's pray. Thank you, Father.

Thank you, Father. That through Jesus Christ, you can be our life. We thank you for the life that you've planted in so many of us. We thank you for the hope that that gives us as we think about our future. And we thank you for the difficult simplicity of the gospel.

And we pray that you would keep us from letting our pride throw us, letting our snobbishness  overlook it, letting our self-satisfaction keep us from working out the radical implications  of the gospel for every area of our life. So we ask that you would help us now to really receive your life through Jesus Christ. We choose it. We ask in Jesus' name, amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

The scripture this morning is taken from the Book of Deuteronomy, chapter 30, verses 11-20. Now, what's I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach. It is not up in heaven so that you have to ask who will ascend to heaven to get it  and proclaim it to us so we may obey it. Nor is it beyond the sea so that you have to ask who will cross the sea to get it and  proclaim it to us so we may obey it. No.

The Word is very near you. It is in your mouth and in your heart. No. You may obey it. See I have set before you today life in prosperity, death and destruction.

For I command you today to love the Lord, your God, to walk in His ways and to keep His  commands, decrees, and laws, then you will live and increase. And the Lord, your God, will bless you in the land you are entering to possess. But if your heart turns away and you are not obedient, and if you are drawn away to bow  down to other gods and worship them, then I declare to you this day that you will certainly  be destroyed. You will not live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess. This day I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you, that I have set before you life  and death blessings and curses, now choose life so that you and your children may live and  that you may love the Lord, your God, listen to His voice and hold fast to Him.

So the Lord is your life, and He will give you many years. In the land He swore to give to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. This is the Word of the Lord. We've been looking at the book of Deuteronomy and we've said that this is a series of sermons  that Moses preached to his people right at the very end of his life, and now we really  truly are at the end of the series, and we're at the end of the last of his sermons. And in verse 16, we see that at the very, very end, he says, he's commanding, that word  command means he's calling or charging his people to enter into a covenant relationship  with God.

So the Lord, you are God and walk in His ways, and for the last couple of weeks been looking  at this, a covenant relationship with God is very personal yet binding and whole life  transforming. And here at the very end, Moses is simply saying, enter that covenant relationship with God. Now one of the most interesting things about this passage is its simplicity and its basicness. It's so basic, so straightforward. Choose.

Here's the one thing you can do. Do this. Don't do this. This will bring this. This will bring this.

So simple. In fact, it's so simple. I actually struggled a little bit with this. I still struggle with this passage, you know why? A preacher loves to take a hard passage and make it simple.

And everybody say, oh, it's simpler than I thought. He's wonderful. He says a wonderful teacher, okay. I actually believe that my job is to take an extremely simple passage today and actually  show you its difficulty. And I believe that's what Moses is trying to show us.

Moses starts saying, look, I'm offering you this personal relationship with God. And he's actually saying, it's not too difficult. It's near you. You don't have to go up to heaven. You don't have to go over the sea.

He's actually trying to say the simplicity of what I'm telling you is its difficulty. People miss this covenant relationship with God because it's so simple. The simplicity is its difficulty. And if you're ever going to get it, you need to come to grips with the difficult simplicity  of having a personal relationship with God. Now, let's look at this difficult simplicity under three headings.

We're going to see here, when it comes to this personal covenant relationship with God,  its deceptive ordinariness, its threatening graciousness, and its unimaginable promise. Its deceptiveness, its deceptive pardon me, ordinariness. Its threatening graciousness, and yet its unimaginable promise. So first, let's look at its ordinariness, which I said is deceptive. Verse 14 says, this word, this charge to enter into a personal relationship with God is near  you.

And then he says, what does that mean? Well, one of the ways to understand that is verse 12. He says, it is not up in heaven so that you have to say, who will ascend into heaven  and get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it. Now ancient cultures, all ancient peoples believe that divine wisdom, divine knowledge, secrets  of the universe, secrets of the meaning of life, secrets for how to live, secrets of  what happens after death. The secrets of the universe are hard to find things, because God or the gods are remote  and they hold their cards to their chests.

The ancient legends are filled with particularly gifted pure people who in body or spirit ascend  to the heavens, and they have visions, or they have visitors from other dimensions, and  they get cryptic oracular utterances and they piece together the truth that only they have. And Moses will have none of it. When he says, you don't have to go up to heaven to get this, what is he saying? He says because the God, with the whole book of Deuteronomy, says the God whom heaven and  highest heaven cannot even contain, has come down. He's come on down into Mount Sinai.

Over and over again, Moses says, God himself came down and told you these things and spoke  to you out of the fire, remember that? So what is Moses saying? If you want the secrets of the universe, you don't have to be an expert elite scientist. Nor do you have to be incredibly sophisticated, artiste poet. You don't only get it at an exclusive retreat in Aspen.

You don't have to climb a mountain to get it, you know why? It's in virtually every hotel room drawer. It's revealed in the Bible and the Bible is everywhere. It's the most accessible book, it's the most easy to get a hold of text, written thing  and print in the whole world. It's all over the place and not only, not only don't you have to climb up to heaven, not  only has it just come right down here and it's available everywhere and it's literally  right under your nose is the secret of the universe, it's under your noses.

You take a motel room, you take a hotel room, the secrets of the universe are in that hotel  room and you didn't even know it. It's so ordinary. But not only I think as Moses when he says it's near you means it's physically accessible. Here it is and my words, here it is and the book, here it is, but it's also intellectually  accessible because of course there's many things in the Bible that are difficult to understand  and we love to sit and figure out what they are but the things in the Bible says over  and over and over again, the court teachings of the Bible are unbelievably accessible. In fact let me give you a summary of the book of Deuteronomy which is all about how God wants  you to live and relate to him.

Here's a summary. Number one, love God and put his will ahead of your own. Two, love your neighbors unsilfcially and put their needs ahead of your own. In other words don't look out for number one but put God in your neighbor's first and  number three, you will find as a result. You will have so much of a richer life and a heart so much more full than it would  have been if you had held onto your heart and held onto your life and tried to fill it  yourself.

It's so simple, it's accessible, it's right there. Moses says you don't have to go up to heaven, it's right there, it's ordinary, everybody  knows it's all around you. It's in your hotel room, the secrets of the universe, now what's the problem? It's deceptive and it's deceptive in two ways. There are two ways, in fact, well for the only two kinds of people in the world it's deceptive.

First of all, there's people who don't believe or have trouble believing biblical faith,  they don't like it or they have trouble with it, they've got difficulties. One of the reasons is the deceptive simplicity. People who don't believe it very often are deceived by the simplicity, why? Well, guess what? Modern people have every bit the same problem that the ancients had.

We think if something's really, really important, some insights really important, it's got  to be brilliant and sophisticated and cutting edge, and new and sexy. Let me tell you, the Bible is not any of those things, but there's always something, but  boy I'll tell you, cautionary tale for me has been in September 9th, New York Times  city section just two weeks ago. There was an article about the last institute in Manhattan that trains psychiatrists in  psychoanalysis, Freudian psychoanalysis. The last institute, the trains, therapists in Freudian psychoanalysis, they were talking  about it, and they've mentioned that even just say 30 years ago, 40 years ago there  were dozens and dozens in Manhattan. One of the reasons I was so intrigued by that was because I know, when I got here like  20 years ago, and I would talk to New Yorkers who at the time were saying their 50s or 60s,  what they told me was that in the middle of the century, every New Yorker who was anybody,  anyone who was savvy, anyone who was with at all went to analysis two or three times a  week for years and years and years, and everybody knew this is it, this is how we're going  to get into our hearts, this is the whole issue, this is it, and if you don't understand  this, you're just out of it, and now it's dead, it's an eclipse, it is, you know, it  is so unsexy, and yet guess what, the gospel's on every street corner, but there's something  else coming, right?

Beware the deceptive simplicity of biblical faith. It really throws people who are having trouble believing it, but guess what, the simplicity  of our faith throws just as much those of us who do believe it. You look at it, well what is the heart of it? Well, you know, the heart of it is, you know, Carl Bart actually said it this way, Jesus  loves me this I know, for the Bible tells me so, there it is, or put it another way is  you're saved by God's grace, and the New Testament adds through the sacrifice of Christ, and  you look at that and you say, okay, I've heard that, I've heard that, I know it, I got it,  I got it, and it's so simple, almost nobody grasped the radical implications of it. Walter Brogiman wrote a commentary on Deuteronomy that I use, I've been using during this series  of sermons, and in what, on this passage where he sees the place where Moses says, this  word is not beyond you, it's near you, you know, it's simple, it's accessible, and  Brogiman, and that place in his commentary tells this fascinating story, true story, and  here's what he says, another illustration of how plain and simple God's word is, is  the account of the evangelical Christian community of Le Chambon in France during World War  2, that hid Jews during Nazi efforts at extermination.

The people of the mountain village, under the direction of evangelical church and pastor,  saved the lives of an estimated three to 5,000 Jews under circumstances extremely dangerous. The state of Israel 1990 recognized the entire village as righteous among the nations for  their remarkable compassion and bravery. So they must have been unusually courageous and noble and insightful, no? After the war, a Jewish adult who was kept alive there as a child returned and interviewed  his protectors about their reasons for taking such risky actions on his behalf, he was  trying to figure out, you know, what was the secret? To his surprise, one after the other all merely shrugged their shoulders, literally, and  said it seemed to be an obvious implication of their faith in Jesus.

They had no dramatic explanations, their actions stem from the very center of their embrace  of the gospel of the sacrificial love of Jesus, and it was enough. Now what Bergman's saying, and it's a powerful point, this account begs a question. The center of the core of the Christian faith, Jesus Christ gave his life, sacrifice his  life, to save, love, and forgive people who didn't believe in him, who were rejecting  him, right? So this little group of French evangelicals in this little mountain village said, well,  if Jesus did that for us, surely we should at least risk our lives to save these people  whether they believe like we do or not. Just a logical implication of what, of the basic Christian faith, the basic Christian  message, right?

Didn't everybody in Europe know the basic Christian message? Hasn't everybody in Europe seen crucifix? Hasn't everybody in Europe, you know, known the basic story? And why didn't they all do that? And the answer is, it's too simple for us.

So you think it's so simple, and it is so simple, but the implications are so vast,  and because we look and so, it's simple, we don't think out the implications, right? Dear friends, do not be deceived by the ordinaryness of what the Bible says about this subject,  not have a personal relationship with God. If you're exploring Christianity, please don't be offended by simplicity and its ordinaryness. And if you're a Christian and you say, oh, I understand the gospel, I get the gospel,  that just proves you don't. It's difficulty, it's simplicity, it's simplicity, it's difficulty.

And you really don't understand it until you really grasp that. Secondly, though, that's not all, that's part of this difficult simplicity. Secondly, there's a threatening graciousness to this. Now, you see, we said, when Moses says, this is near you, in the sense of you don't have  to go to heaven to get it, because it's revealed in the Bible. But now here's another thought.

He says, what I am commanding you today, verse 11, is not too difficult for you,  or beyond your reach, why? It is not beyond the sea so that you have to ask, who shall cross the sea to get it? Now, the sea is a little different metaphor in the ancient world. The sea was the symbol of chaos and destruction. In fact, Paul, we're going to get back to this, Paul quotes this whole passage in Romans 10.

But when he quotes the passage in Romans 10, he calls the sea the abyss. And of course, there's a couple of good movies, by the way. There's a good movie about the sea called the abyss. Because in ancient times, the sea was represented death, destruction. Sea fairers were far more vulnerable than people who were on land.

And so the sea represented the abyss and death. Now, what is Moses talking about here? He says, because ancient people and the ancient legends are filled with heroic noble figures  on a quest. And they go out on the sea. And the quest can be a number of things.

One of the great ones is Jason and the Argonauts. It's made in many bad, great movies. Just a great story about Jason goes off of the Argonauts and he's looking for a golden  fleece that is guarded by a dragon and he gets the golden fleece. But there's many perils. There's many riddles that he has to solve.

And many perils and he comes back and he gains the kingdom. And there are just an enormous number of these. It's almost all the cultures, all the ancient cultures, no matter where they have these strong  figures who go on these quests over the sea to gain a kingdom or eternal life. My favorite Hollywoodized version of all those ancient legends, and it's a really good  Hollywoodized version, is the third of the Indiana Jones movies. You remember where Indiana Jones and his archeologist father are after the holy grail.

And they believe that if they get the holy grail and you drink from it, you'll get eternal  life. And they have perils and there are clues just like all the other ancient, the movie makers  just understood all the other ancient pre-mythic histories. You remember what the clues were? First, the breath of God, only the penitent man will pass. See, every one of these reminds you of another special effect.

The word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth. And that's what all these stories are about. You want salvation? See, you want eternal life?

You want the kingdom? Clues, greatness, quest, over the sea. The leap, prove your worth, and Moses will have none of it. Instead he says, and this is what's so interesting, he says, it's not over the sea. You don't go over the sea to get it, what?

Then what is it? He says, it's in your mouth and in your heart. So your heart is where you believe, your mouth is what you confess, and what is he saying? He says, this relationship with God is not something you achieve, it's something you receive. It's not something that you prove your worth, you just get it.

And therefore he's talking, he's saying, that this relationship with God is not something  that you go to heaven to get, you go over the sea to get, you don't go on some kind of  quest, you don't have to be some heroic warrior, you receive it by grace. Now this is threatening, and this is our second problem we have with it. If you want a perfect example of this, and it's a great example, is the biblical story  of Naaman in 2 Kings chapter 5. In 2 Kings chapter 5 we're told about Naaman who was a Syrian general, and he was stricken  with leprosy, and he knew he was going to die if he wasn't healed, and he heard about  the God of Israel and his power. So he decided to go to Israel and find the prophet Elisha and seek his healing and salvation.

And the text tells us the way he's salad forth to do so, and what he brought with him  showed that he understood himself being on a quest. He went with gold and treasure to buy whatever and purchase whatever he had to. He went with a sword, ready to do a great deed because he was a man of prowess and valor. He went with letters of recommendation from his king, and so on, and he gets to the  prophet's house, and Elisha doesn't even come out. Instead he's told by the valet of Elisha, go wash in the Jordan River.

And a Naaman is furious, and he runs away in fury, and his servants go after them, and  they say, master, master, if you were told by the prophet to do some great deed, wouldn't  you have done it? And that's the point. He's like all people, all ancient people, all modern people. If there's salvation, we're going to achieve it, we have to prove our worth, we have to  leap from the lion's head, we have to bring out our sword, we have to do some great deed. He was expecting Elisha to come out and say, bring me the broomstick of the wicked witch  of the west.

And he would have been, he says, you see, here's what he's saying. He says, I'm a man of valor, I'm a man of wealth and means hard one. And it wouldn't be insulting to say, go get the broomstick of the wicked witch of the  west, get the golden fleece from the dragon, it wouldn't be wrong if you asked me to purchase  with my great wealth, my healing and my salvation, or to win it by slaying a dragon. But any idiot can wash in the Jordan River, any child can wash in the Jordan River. That kind of God has a bar of salvation so low.

You know, Kathy and I remember, the one was the first person I ever shared the gospel  faith with in our little town in Hope, Well, Virginia, where I first went as a 24-year-old  pastor. And it was a young, really hurting young mother on welfare, single mother. And I shared the gospel and she said, it can't be that easy. You know, same thing. That kind of God would have the bar of salvation so low.

But the answer is, on the one hand, we have a God so incredibly inclusive that you've  got grace, and that's a bar that anyone can step over, any murderer, any broken person,  anyone can step over the bar because it's a bar of grace, but it's actually not low. Demands and it requires that you lose your pride. Come on, Naaman, you say this is too low for me. No, you're not stepping over it, are you? Why not?

It's too high for you because there's two things that they offer a free grace, the graciousness  of this offer. There's two things that it demands you to give up. One is, you're right to look down on anybody else the rest of your life. You have to give up your pride. You have to give up forever.

You're right to look at anyone else and say, you don't understand, you rabble, you want  clean, you fools. You're the reason that things are the way they are in this country. He takes away forever the idea, the pride because you have to say, I'm just a sinner, I need  to be saved by grace. The other thing you have to give up is control of your life because you see if you had  salad forth, and if you had won your salvation with the kingdom or eternal life on a great  quest, then God couldn't just ask anything of you, you have your rights. You've done what you should be doing.

But if you out everything, everything, everything to His mercy, you owe Him everything. You can't call the shots in your life anymore, don't you see? The incredible inclusiveness at the same time, the threatening costliness of the free grace  of God, it is so simple, it is so easy that we can't take it, we're threatened by it. You see how this, see here's another aspect of this incredibly difficult simplicity. This threatening graciousness, our pride, because of our pride, the absolute graciousness  of the gospel throws us, don't let it throw you, but we're not done.

First aspect of this difficult simplicity is the deceptive ordinariness. The second aspect is the threatening graciousness, but the third aspect is the unimaginable  promise. What do I mean by that? You're smart people, this is New York, so if you're reading that passage, you realize  that I've been concentrating on the first part of the passage, which seems to be all about  grace. You don't have to go to heaven, you don't have to go over the sea, it's right there in  your mouth in your heart, you have to believe in your heart and confess with your mouth,  and it's there, it's right there, but then you get to the last part, and it seems like  the second part totally contradicts what was just said, because it says, you see, if your  heart turns away and you're not obedient, and if you're drawn away to bow down to other  gods and worship them, I declare to you this day you will certainly be destroyed.

You will not live long in the land. This day I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you that I have set before you life  and death, blessings and curses, choose life, or else all these curses will come upon  you. And wait a minute, we say, wait a minute, that seems like we're back to the quest thing,  we're back to going over the sea again. Because we've been through this, all the book of Deuteronomy, we see what we're supposed  to do, we see how we're supposed to live, we see how we're supposed to cheat God, we see  how we're supposed to treat everyone else, and we'll never live up to that all the time. We'll never live up to that all the time.

So it almost seems like the second part of this text poses a huge problem, it seems to  contradict the first part, but it doesn't. Because of the note, there is hope. You know what the hope is, it's in the very final verse, it's in the very, almost the final  word of Moses, where he says, for the Lord is your life. Let me tell you what's going on there, let me tell you what an incredible promise that  is, the first time in the Bible that that statement is made, and I think it's the last  time in the whole Old Testament. See up to now, life, and we're not talking about biological life, right?

Choose life. It's not biological life, so what are they saying? It's spiritual life, it's eternal life, it's the new heart and all that. Talked about that last week. So choose life.

Up until this point, life is connected with obedience, and death is connected with disobedience. If you obey, you'll get life, in other words, your obedience is your life. And if you disobey, you'll get death, in other words, your disobedience is your death. So choose life, so obey. And all the way through the book up to now, that's what it's been telling you, your obedience  is your life.

Every time this word life, the spiritual life thing comes up, it says, if you obey, you'll  get life, your obedience is your life, your obedience is your life. But verse 20, suddenly, suddenly, Moses basically says here, your obedience would be your life,  and it could be your life, but because it can't be your life, because you're not going  to keep it up, the Lord will be your life. What does that mean? Not that the Lord will give you life if you obey. That's not what it's saying.

It says the Lord will be your life, the Lord himself will be your life. What does that mean? Paul explains it in Romans 10. In Romans chapter 10, Paul comes to this very passage when he's proclaiming the gospel  of Jesus Christ to the readers of the book of Romans, to the Romans. He goes to this very passage and he interprets the passage in the most unbelievable way.

Here's what he says. This is Romans 10. Christ is the end of the law, says Paul, as a means of righteousness for everyone who believes. Now about this righteousness that comes through faith, Moses has said, quote, do not say in  your heart who will ascend into heaven, for that would bring Christ down. And he says, do not say who will descend into the deep, for that would bring Christ, that  would be to bring Christ up from the abyss, but what does it say?

What does Moses say? He says, the word is near you, it is in your mouth and in your heart, that is the word  of faith we are proclaiming, that if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe  in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Did you hear that? Look, first of all, he says, Christ is the end of the law, not period. He says, Christ is the end of the law for righteousness.

It's still there to please God, to change your life, but it's no longer a means to stand  before God, righteousness and accept it, don't I know? Why not? Jesus went into the abyss. Jesus went on the quest for eternal life. Moses says, Paul says, Moses says you don't have to go to heaven, no because Jesus has come  down from heaven.

Paul says, Moses says you don't have to go over to see because Jesus went into the depths  of the sea and he took the destructive forces and he received a destruction that we deserve. He took the curses in himself, he was destroyed. He went on a great quest, he went on the quest. He won eternal life and now he gives it to us as a gift, but I want you to know one thing. The quest of Jesus Christ was different than any other quest that's ever happened.

I read a scholarly article some years ago that really blew my socks off. It was amazing. First of all, it was a scholarly article. It was by a scholar who was actually trying to look and speak broadly about almost all  the ancient mythic prehistories of all the different cultures, whether Northern European  or Mediterranean, Greek and Roman or Asian, and they were looking at all these stories  and all these legends and they all had, there was a certain pattern to all of them. That was, you had these strong heroic figures who went on quests to win something.

They were all about that. All the legends were like that. Strong heroic figures who went on quests to win something and then the article amazingly  said this, the scholar of the last generation who knew the most in the entire world about  these ancient myths and legends, knew them in the originals and all that. The scholar of the last generation who knew most more about them than anybody else alive  was J.R. R.

Tolkien, who was an Oxford professor. This article said, secondly, he loved them so much that he wanted to write his own. He wanted to write his own mythic story about a quest and he did, but 0.3, he was so saturated  with Christianity and so saturated with the Christian gospel that his story is almost the  antithesis of every other mythic prehistory that ever happened. Because every single other ancient legend has a strong figure going off to save the world  by winning something. But in Tolkien and in the gospel, the world is saved by a weak figure who triumphs through  losing and goes off quest not to gain something but to lose something.

You see at the heart of history and at the heart of ours is a suffering servant who  triumphed through losing, who fell into the dark so we could live in the light. And that's the reason why Jesus quest is different than all these other self-saving, self-justifying  quests in all the other cultures. And that's the reason why there's one Christian poet Edward Chilato who addressing Jesus  spoke to him this way. The other gods were strong but thou was weak. They rode but thou just stumbled to your throne.

But to our wounds only God's wounds can speak and not a God has wounds but thou alone. The other gods were strong but thou was weak. They rode but you did stumble to your throne. You are wounds only God's wounds can speak and there's no God in any of the religion  that has wounds but thou alone. The simplicity is the difficulties, let me close like this.

If you are exploring Christianity or if you have maybe come to, you know, you may be  erased in a church and now you're trying to think, well, what's my relationship to Christianity? Tell my word, please realize that in some ways understand the difficulty of the simplicity  and grasping the simplicity in all of its difficulty is how you become a Christian. You want to know how to become a Christian? You want to know how to get a covenant relationship with God? That's it.

You say, well, that's paradoxical. What do you mean? Give me a perfect case study. In 1740s, there were a group of young men who were actually all part of the church. In fact, I think some of them were ordained ministers.

They were in the Church of England and they were in London but they knew there was something  missing. They knew they didn't have a personal relationship with God. They didn't have a covenant relationship with God. They didn't have a new heart. They began a set of evening meetings in which they read to each other Luther's preface to  the Galatians, Martin Luther's preface to the book of the Galatians.

On successive nights over a period of a week or so, John Wesley, founder of the Methodist  Church, Charles Wesley, great hymn writer and his brother and a whole lot of their friends  got converted. When the penny dropped of the simplicity of the grace of God, here's one of the men  named William Holland that you wouldn't have heard of, but it's a perfect example of  what happened. This is his diary. Mr. Charles Wesley read aloud and at the place where Luther said, what have we then  nothing to do?

No, nothing. But only to accept him who of God is made unto us who becomes for us, our wisdom, our  righteousness, our sanctification, our redemption. And adhering those words, there came such a power over me as I cannot well imagine my  end described. My heart was so filled with peace and love that I burst into tears and went afterwards  I went into the street. I could scarcely feel the ground I trot upon.

Now what happened was the simplicity of grace hit him. And the moment that happened, and the moment he was willing to pay those to cost, to get  rid of your pride, to say from now on, I'll never be able to look down at anybody, and  to get rid of any control of your life, because now you know you owe him everything, everything  to his mercy. If you're willing to pay those prices and the simplicity of grace happens at that moment  you are becoming a Christian, at that moment you are entering into that personal relationship  with God. And you say, well, if, what if I already believe? You have a final word for me, sure.

The life, the life that's in you. God is your life. Because of Jesus, he's your life now. It's guaranteed. It's in you.

That's why Colossians 3, Paul says, and 1 John 3, they talks about our life is hid with  God. Our life is in God. And we really don't even know what we're going to be. And when Jesus Christ is revealed on the last day, we know we'll be like Him. I mean, it's over the top.

The life that started in you is just a sea. You're just a shadow of what you're going to be. See us Lewis describes though what you are going to be. Live in hope of this. He will make the feeblest and filthiest of us into dazzling radiant immortal creatures, pulsating  through with an energy, joy, wisdom and love as we cannot now imagine.

He can make us all bright, stainless mirrors which reflect back to God perfectly though on  a smaller scale, his own boundless power, delight and goodness. That is what we are in for. Nothing less. Let's pray. Thank you, Father.

Thank you, Father. That through Jesus Christ, you can be our life. We thank you for the life that you've planted in so many of us. We thank you for the hope that that gives us as we think about our future. And we thank you for the difficult simplicity of the gospel.

And we pray that you would keep us from letting our pride throw us, letting our snobbishness  overlook it, letting our self-satisfaction keep us from working out the radical implications  of the gospel for every area of our life. So we ask that you would help us now to really receive your life through Jesus Christ. We choose it. We ask in Jesus' name, amen.

### 中文翻译

今天早晨的经文取自《申命记》三十章11—20节。如今，我今日所吩咐你的，并不是你觉得太难、也不是你力不能及的。它不在天上，使你不得不说：谁替我们上到天上取下来，传给我们，使我们可以听见而遵行呢？它也不在海那边，使你不得不说：谁替我们渡过海去取来，传给我们，使我们可以听见而遵行呢？不。

这话离你甚近，就在你口中，在你心里。不。你可以遵行。看哪，我今日将生与福乐、死与祸患陈明在你面前。

我今日吩咐你，要爱耶和华你的神，行祂的道，谨守祂的诫命、律例、典章，你就必存活，人数增多；耶和华你的神也必在你进去要得为业的地上赐福与你。倘若你心里偏离，不肯听从，却被勾引去敬拜别神、事奉它们，我今日明明告诉你们，你们必要灭亡；你们过约旦河进去要得为业的地上，你们的日子必不长久。今日我呼天唤地向你作见证：我将生与死、福与祸摆在你面前；所以你要拣选生命，使你和你的后裔都得存活，并且你要爱耶和华你的神，听从祂的声音，专靠祂。

因为耶和华是你的生命；祂必使你在祂起誓要赐给你列祖亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各之地上年日长久。这是耶和华的话。我们一直在看《申命记》，并且我们说过，这是摩西在他生命将尽之时，向他的百姓所讲的一系列讲道；如今我们确实已经到了这系列的末尾，也到了他最后一篇讲道的末尾

而在第16节，我们看到在最后最后，他说的是一种命令；“命令”这个词的意思是，他在呼召或嘱托他的百姓，进入与神立约的关系。

所以，“耶和华是你的神，你要行在他的道中”。过去几周我们一直在看这一点：与神的立约关系非常个人，却又具有约束力，并且会改变人的整个人生。而在这里的末了，摩西只是说：进入那与神立约的关系。现在，这段经文最有意思的一点，就是它的简单和基础。它太基础了，太直接了。选择。

这就是你能做的一件事：做这个；不要做那个。这样会带来这个；那样会带来那个。

太简单了。事实上，它简单到让我有点挣扎。我到现在仍然在这段经文上挣扎，你知道为什么吗？传道人喜欢把一段很难的经文讲得简单。

然后大家就说：“哦，比我想的更简单。”他真了不起。他真是个好老师，懂吗？我其实相信，我今天的工作，是把一段极其简单的经文，反而把它的困难显明出来。我相信这正是摩西想向我们指出的。

摩西开始说：“看，我在把这与神的个人关系摆在你们面前。”而他其实是在说：这并不太难；它就在你近旁。你不必上到天上，也不必渡过海洋。

他是在说：我告诉你们的这件事之所以简单，正是它的困难所在。人之所以错过与神的立约关系，是因为它太简单了；简单本身就是它的困难。而你若要真正得着它，就必须正视：与神建立个人关系这件事那“困难的简单”。现在，让我们从三个方面来看这“困难的简单”。

我们将看到：当谈到这与神的个人立约关系时，它有迷惑性的平常、带着威胁的恩典，以及不可想象的应许。它的迷惑性——抱歉，是它迷惑性的平常；它带着威胁的恩典；以及它不可想象的应许。所以首先，让我们来看它的平常性，我说这是带着迷惑性的。第14节说：“这句话，这个 ch”

……使你进入与上帝建立个人关系的道路就在你身边。

然后他说，这是什么意思呢？理解它的一个方式是看第12节。他说：“这命令不在天上，使你说：‘谁替我们上到天上取下来，传给我们，使我们遵行呢？’”在古代文化里，几乎所有古人都相信：神圣的智慧、神圣的知识——宇宙的奥秘、生命意义的奥秘、如何生活的奥秘、死后将会发生什么的奥秘——都是很难找到的，因为上帝或诸神遥不可及，他们把牌紧紧捂在胸前。

古代传说里充满了这样的人：一些格外有天赋、特别纯洁的人，在身体或灵里升到天上，看见异象；或者有来自其他维度的访客；他们得到隐晦、神谕式的话语，然后把只有他们才拥有的真理拼凑出来。摩西完全不接受这种说法。当他说“你不必上到天上去把这话取下来”时，他在说什么？他是在说：那位连天和天上的天都容不下的上帝——整卷《申命记》都在强调这一点——已经降下来了。他降到了西奈山。

摩西一再说，是上帝亲自降下来，把这些事告诉你，并在火中对你说话——你还记得吗？那么摩西在说什么？如果你想知道宇宙的奥秘，你不必成为专家、精英科学家；也不必是极其老练的艺术家、诗人；你也不是只能在阿斯彭那种封闭的高端静修营里才得到它。

你不必爬上一座山去获得它，你知道为什么吗？因为它几乎就在每一间酒店房间抽屉里。它已经在《圣经》中启示出来，而《圣经》到处都是。它是最容易接触到的书，是全世界最容易拿到手的文本、文字与印刷品。它无处不在。不但你不必上到天上去——不但它已经降到这里、随处可得——而且宇宙的奥秘简直就在你鼻子底下，就在你眼前。

你住进一家汽车旅馆，你住进一家酒店，宇宙的奥秘就在那间酒店的抽屉里。

你每天都在与它擦肩而过，却甚至没有意识到。它太普通了。

但我想，摩西说“它离你很近”不仅是指它在物理上触手可及。你看，这里就是——我的话在这里，书在这里，就在你眼前；它也在智性上触手可及，因为当然，《圣经》里有许多东西难以理解，我们也喜欢坐下来琢磨它们到底是什么意思。但《圣经》一再一再强调的那些核心教导，却出奇地容易理解、出奇地清晰。

事实上，让我给你一个《申命记》的概要。《申命记》整卷书都在讲上帝希望你如何生活、如何与祂建立关系。

下面是摘要：第一，爱上帝，把祂的旨意置于你自己的意愿之上。第二，无私地爱你的邻舍，把他们的需要置于你自己的需要之上。换句话说，不要只顾自己，把上帝放在第一位，把邻舍放在第一位。第三，你会因此发现：你的生命会丰富得多，你的心会充实得多——远超过你死死抓住自己的心、抓住自己的生活、试图靠自己把它填满时所能得到的。

这太简单了，这很容易获得，就在那里。摩西说，你不必上到天上去，它就在眼前；它很普通，人人都知道，它无处不在。就在你的旅馆房间里——宇宙的奥秘。那问题出在哪里呢？它具有迷惑性，而且它在两方面迷惑人。事实上，对于世界上仅有的两类人来说，它都是迷惑性的。

首先，有一些人不相信——或者很难相信——《圣经》的信仰；他们不喜欢它，或者对它感到为难，心里有许多疑问。其中一个原因就是这种“迷惑性的简单”。不信的人常常被它的简单所迷惑，为什么呢？你猜怎么着？现代人的问题，和古人一模一样。

我们总觉得：如果某件事真的、真的很重要；如果某个洞见真的很重要，那它一定得聪明绝顶、复杂精妙、走在最前沿、新颖又性感。我告诉你，《圣经》并不是这些东西中的任何一种——不过它总有别的东西。但我跟你说，对我来说一个极具警醒意味的故事，是9月9日《纽约时报》ci

就在两周前。《纽约时报》有一篇文章讲到曼哈顿最后一家训练精神科医生从事精神分析——弗洛伊德式精神分析——的机构。最后一家训练治疗师做弗洛伊德式精神分析的机构。他们在谈这件事时提到，就在三十年前、四十年前，曼哈顿还有一打又一打这样的机构。我之所以对那篇文章特别感兴趣，其中一个原因是：我知道我大概二十年前来到这里时，跟一些当时五十多岁或六十多岁的纽约人交谈，他们告诉我，在本世纪中叶，凡是有头有脸的纽约人、凡是精明的人、凡是稍微跟得上潮流的人，都会去做分析——一周两三次——持续好多好多年。人人都知道：就是这个，这就是我们要进入内心的方法，这才是关键，这就是一切；如果你不懂这个，你就落伍了。而现在它死了，像日食一样消失了；你知道，它变得一点也不性感了。可你猜怎么着？福音却在每一个街角都在出现；但是又有别的东西正在到来，对吧？

要当心圣经信仰那种迷惑人的“简单”。这会让那些难以相信的人很受冲击；但你猜怎么着，这信仰的简单同样也会冲击我们这些已经相信的人。你看它，会问：它的核心是什么？嗯，你知道，它的核心就是——卡尔·巴特其实是这么说的——“耶稣爱我，我知道，因为圣经告诉我”，就这么简单。或者换一种说法：你是靠着上帝的恩典得救，而新约又补充说，是借着基督的牺牲。你看着这一切会说：好吧，我听过，我听过，我知道了，我懂了，我懂了。它是如此简单，以至于几乎没有人真正把它那颠覆性的含义抓住。沃尔特·布鲁格曼写过一部《申命记》注释，我在这一系列讲道中一直在用。在他注释这段经文时，他看到摩西说“这话离你不远，就在你近旁”——你知道，很简单，很容易接近——布鲁格曼在他注释的那个地方讲了一个引人入胜的故事，一个真实的故事。以下是他所说的：

上帝的话语何等直白、何等简单，还有一个例证：二战期间，法国勒尚邦（Le Chambon）的福音派基督徒群体在纳粹试图灭绝犹太人的行动中藏匿犹太人。

这个山村的居民在福音派教会和牧师的带领下，在极其危险的处境中，救了估计三千到五千名犹太人的性命。1990年，以色列国认可整个村庄为“列国义人”，表彰他们非凡的怜悯与勇敢。所以，他们一定是格外勇敢、高尚、而且富有洞见的人，是吗？战后，一位当年在那儿得以存活、如今已成年的犹太人回到村里，采访那些保护过他的人，询问他们为何愿意为他冒如此大的风险；他想弄明白，你知道，那秘诀是什么？令他惊讶的是，一个接一个的人都只是耸耸肩——真的就是耸耸肩——说这不过是他们对耶稣的信仰所显而易见的含义。

他们没有任何戏剧性的解释；他们的行动源自他们拥抱福音的最核心——耶稣舍己之爱的福音——这就够了。现在，伯格曼所说的——而且这是一个极有力的观点——这个故事引出了一个问题。基督信仰的核心中心是什么？耶稣基督为拯救、爱与饶恕那些不信他、拒绝他的人，献上了自己的生命，牺牲了自己的生命，对吗？所以，这群法国福音派基督徒在这个小小的山村里说：既然耶稣为我们都这样做了，我们至少也应该冒着生命危险去救这些人——不管他们是否像我们一样相信。只是对基督信仰、基督信息最基本内容的一个合乎逻辑的推论，对吧？

难道欧洲每个人都不知道最基本的基督信息吗？难道欧洲每个人都见过十字架吗？难道欧洲每个人，你知道，都听过那个最基本的故事吗？那为什么他们都没有这样做？答案是：这对我们来说太简单了。

所以你觉得这太简单了，而它确实太简单；但其中的含义却极其广阔。正因为我们看它这么简单，我们就不去把它的含义想透，对吧？亲爱的朋友们，不要被 t 所迷惑

《圣经》在这个主题上所说的那种平常、普通——并不是与上帝建立一种个人关系。如果你正在探索基督信仰，请不要因为它的简单与平常而感到被冒犯。如果你是基督徒，却说：哦，我明白福音了，我懂福音了——那恰恰证明你并不懂。它的难处在于它的简单；它的简单也正是它的难处。

你直到真正抓住这一点，才算真正明白。其次，不过，这还不是全部，这只是这种“困难的简单”其中一部分。第二，这里面有一种带着威胁的恩慈。你看，我们说过，当摩西说“这离你不远”时，意思是你不必上到天上去把它取下来，因为它已经在《圣经》中启示出来了。但现在还有另一个想法。

他说：“我今日所吩咐你的”（第11节）并不太难，也不在你能力所及之外，为什么？“这也不在海那边，使你说：谁替我们过海取了来？”然而，在古代世界，“海”是一个略有不同的隐喻。海象征混乱与毁灭。事实上，保罗——我们还会回到这一点——在《罗马书》10章引用了这整段经文。

但他在《罗马书》10章引用这段话时，把“海”称为“深渊”。顺便说一句，当然也有几部不错的电影。有一部关于海的好电影就叫《深渊》。因为在古代，海代表死亡、毁灭。航海者比陆地上的人脆弱得多。

因此，海代表深渊与死亡。那么摩西在这里说的是什么呢？他说，因为古人以及古代传说里充满了那些踏上征途的英雄豪杰。他们出海远行。而这场征途的目标可以有很多种。

其中一个很经典的例子是《杰森与阿尔戈英雄》。它被拍成过许多很烂但也很精彩的电影。那是个很棒的故事：杰森与阿尔戈英雄们出发，寻找一件被巨龙看守的金羊毛，他最终得到了金羊毛。但途中有许多险境，有许多谜题要解。

他经历许多危险，归来并赢得王国。而类似的故事数量极其庞大，几乎遍布所有文化中，

所有古代文化，无论在哪里，都有这些强有力的人物，他们踏上海上远征，去赢得一个国度或得到永生。我最喜欢的、好莱坞式改编的这些古老传奇版本——而且确实是个很不错的好莱坞版本——就是《夺宝奇兵》系列的第三部。你还记得印第安纳·琼斯和他身为考古学家的父亲去寻找圣杯的那段吗？

他们相信，如果找到了圣杯并从中饮用，就能获得永生。一路上有危险，也有线索，就像所有其他古代故事一样；电影创作者其实很懂那些古老的、前神话式的历史叙事。你还记得那些线索是什么吗？第一，“上帝的气息”，只有悔改的人才能通过。看，每一个都让你想起另一种特效。

第二，“上帝的话语”，只有踏着上帝的脚步他才能前行。第三，“上帝的道路”，只有从狮子头上纵身一跃，他才能证明自己的价值。而这些故事讲的就是这个：你想要拯救吗？看，你想要永生吗？

你想要那个国度吗？线索、伟大、远征、跨越大海。纵身一跃，证明你的价值——但摩西一点也不吃这一套。相反，他说——这就很有意思——他说：不在海那边。你不必渡海去得着它，什么？

那它到底是什么呢？他说：就在你的口里，也在你的心里。你的心是你相信的地方，你的口是你承认的内容；他在说什么？他说：与上帝的这种关系不是你去成就的，而是你去领受的。不是你去证明自己配得，你只是得着它。

因此他在谈论的是：与上帝的这种关系，不是你上到天上去得着，也不是你渡海去得着；你不必踏上一场什么远征，不必成为某种英勇的战士；你是凭恩典领受它的。现在这很具威胁性，这也是我们对它的第二个问题。若你想要一个完美的例子——而这确实是个很好的例子——就是《列王纪下》第5章里乃缦的故事。《列王纪下》第5章告诉我们，乃缦是亚兰（叙利亚）的将军，他患了麻风；他知道如果不被医治，他就会死

他得了麻风，也听说了以色列的神以及祂的大能。于是他决定前往以色列，去找先知以利沙，寻求医治与拯救。

经文告诉我们，他是怎样出发去做这件事的；他所带着的一切也显明他明白自己是在进行一场“求取”的远征。他带着金子和财宝，预备不惜代价买到、换到他必须得到的东西。他带着刀剑，准备立下大功，因为他是个有本领、有勇武的人。他还带着国王写的推荐信等等。等他到了先知的家，以利沙甚至不出来见他；他只是从以利沙的仆人那里得到一句话：你去约旦河里洗。

于是乃缦大怒，怒气冲冲地转身离开。他的仆人追上去，对他说：主人，主人！若先知吩咐你做一件大事，难道你不会去做吗？这正是关键。他和所有人一样——古代人如此，现代人也如此——如果有拯救，我们就要靠自己去赢得它；我们得证明自己的价值；我们得从狮子的头上跳过去；我们得拔出刀剑；我们得做一件大事。他原以为以利沙会出来说：“把西方恶女巫的扫帚柄拿来给我。”

而他本来会——他在说的就是这个意思——他说：“你看，我是个有勇武的人，我是个富有、能办事的人。若你说：去取西方恶女巫的扫帚柄，去从龙那里夺来金羊毛；若你要我用巨大的财富买来医治与拯救，或要我靠杀死一条龙来赢得它，这都不会冒犯我。但任何傻子都能在约旦河里洗，任何孩子都能在约旦河里洗。这样的神把拯救的门槛设得太低了。”

你知道，凯西和我记得，我第一次在弗吉尼亚州霍普韦尔那个小镇分享福音信仰的对象，是一位非常受伤的年轻母亲——领救济的单身妈妈。我把福音讲给她听，她说：“不可能这么容易。”你看，一样的反应。这样的神会把拯救的门槛设得太低了。

但答案是，一方面

朋友们，我们有一位上帝，他的包容性大得不可思议：你得着的是恩典——那是一道任何人都能跨过去的门槛；任何杀人犯、任何破碎的人，都能跨过去，因为那是恩典的门槛。但它其实并不低；它有要求，它要求并且需要你放下你的骄傲。来吧，乃缦，你说这对我来说太低了。不，其实你并没有跨过去，是吗？为什么不？

它对你来说太高了，因为这白白的恩典、这份邀请的恩慈，有两样东西要求你放弃。有一样是：你一生都不再有资格去轻看任何人。你必须放下你的骄傲，你必须永远把它放下。

你不再有资格看着任何人说：“你不懂，你们这些乌合之众；你们还想要清白，你们这些蠢人。这个国家变成这样都是你们的错。”它永远夺走这种想法——那种骄傲，因为你必须说：“我不过是个罪人，我需要靠恩典得救。”你还必须放弃的另一件事，是对你人生的掌控。因为你看，如果你曾经出征，如果你曾靠着一场伟大的征途赢得了救恩、赢得了国度或永生，那么上帝就不能随意向你要求什么；你有你的权利，你已经做了你该做的。

但如果你把一切、一切、一切都交在他的怜悯之下，你就欠他一切。你再也不能在自己的人生里发号施令了，你明白吗？这恩典何等包容，同时又何等具有威胁性的代价——上帝白白的恩典，就是如此：它如此简单，如此容易，以至于我们反而接受不了；我们被它威胁。你看到了吗？你看，这是这“极其艰难的简单”另一个层面。这令人不安的恩慈，会触动我们的骄傲；因着我们的骄傲，福音那绝对的白白恩典使我们不知所措——别让它把你弄得失去分寸——但我们还没讲完。

这“艰难的简单”的第一方面，是那具有欺骗性的平凡。第二方面，是那带着威胁的恩慈；第三方面，是那难以想象的应许。

我是什么意思？你们都是聪明人，这里是纽约，所以当你读那段经文时，你会意识到：我一直在专注于经文的前半部分，而那部分似乎

这一切都在讲恩典。你不必上到天上，你不必渡过海洋，它就在你口里、在你心里；你要心里相信、口里承认，它就在那里，就在你眼前。可是当你读到最后一段时，似乎第二部分完全与刚才所说的相矛盾，因为它说：你看，如果你的心偏离，你不顺服；如果你被引诱去向别神跪拜、敬奉它们，我今日宣告你们：你们必定灭亡。

你们必不得在那地上长久居住。今日我呼天唤地向你们作见证：我将生与死、福与祸陈明在你们面前；你们要选择生命，不然这一切咒诅都要临到你们。等一下，我们会说，等一下，这不就又回到“去寻求”的那一套了吗？又回到要渡海那一套了吗？因为我们已经一路读过申命记全书，我们看见我们该做什么，我们看见我们该怎样生活，我们看见我们该怎样欺哄上帝，我们看见我们该怎样对待每一个人——而我们永远不可能时时刻刻都做到。我们永远不可能时时刻刻都做到。

所以，这段经文的第二部分似乎提出了一个巨大的难题，似乎与第一部分相矛盾，但其实并不矛盾。因为有一句提示：仍有盼望。你知道盼望是什么吗？在最后一节，就在摩西几乎最后的那句话里，他说：“因为耶和华是你的生命。”让我告诉你那里发生了什么，让我告诉你那是多么不可思议的应许——这是圣经里第一次出现这样的陈述，我想也是整个旧约里最后一次。

你看，到目前为止，“生命”——我们说的不是生物学意义上的生命，对吧？

选择生命。这不是生物学的生命，那他们在说什么？是属灵的生命，是永恒的生命，是新心等等。上周我们讲过。所以，要选择生命。

在此之前，生命与顺服相连，死亡与悖逆相连。你若顺服，就得生命；换句话说，你的顺服就是你的生命。你若不顺服，就会得

死亡，换句话说，你的悖逆就是你的死亡。所以要选择生命，就要顺服。直到如今，整本书一路下来都是这样告诉你：你的顺服就是你的生命。

每一次“生命”这个词、属灵生命这件事被提起时，它都说：如果你顺服，你就会得着生命；你的顺服就是你的生命；你的顺服就是你的生命。但到了第20节，忽然，忽然之间，摩西在这里基本上说：你的顺服本可以成为你的生命，也可能成为你的生命；但因为它不可能成为你的生命——因为你不会坚持到底——主将成为你的生命。这是什么意思？不是说你若顺服，主就会赐你生命。它说的不是这个。

它说“主将成为你的生命”，主自己要成为你的生命。这是什么意思？保罗在《罗马书》10章里解释了这一点。在《罗马书》第10章，当保罗向罗马书的读者、向罗马人宣讲耶稣基督的福音时，他就来到这段经文，并且以一种最令人难以置信的方式来解读它。

他是这样说的。这是《罗马书》10章。保罗说：“基督是律法的终结”，不是句号。他说：“基督是律法的终结，为要使凡信的人都得着义。”至于这因信而来的义，摩西曾说——引文如下——“你心里不要说：谁要升到天上去？那就是要领下基督来。”他又说：“也不要说：谁要下到深渊去？那就是要把基督从无底坑里领上来。”那么，经上到底怎么说呢？

摩西怎么说？他说：“这道离你不远，就在你口里，也在你心里。”也就是说，我们所传信心的道：你若口里认耶稣为主，心里信神叫他从死里复活，就必得救。你听见了吗？你看，首先他说：“基督是律法的终结”，并不是句号。他说：“基督是律法的终结，为的是称义。”律法仍然在那里，为要讨神喜悦，为要改变你的生命，但它不再是你站在神面前、得着义与蒙悦纳的途径，我知道吗？为什么不再是？因为耶稣下到深渊里。耶稣踏上了寻求永生的征途。摩西说，保罗说，摩西说你不

不必上到天上去，不，因为耶稣已经从天降下。

保罗说，摩西说，你不必渡海去看，因为耶稣下到海的深处，担当了那些毁灭性的力量，承受了我们应得的毁灭。他把咒诅都归在自己身上，他被毁坏了。他踏上了一场伟大的远征，他走上了那条征途。他赢得了永生，如今把它当作礼物赐给我们。但我想让你知道一件事：耶稣基督的征途不同于世上曾经发生过的任何其他征途。

几年前我读过一篇学术文章，真是让我大开眼界，太惊人了。首先，那是一篇学术文章。作者是一位学者，他试图以更宏观的方式来研究并论述几乎所有不同文化中那些古老的神话性远古传说：无论是北欧的，还是地中海的，希腊罗马的，或是亚洲的。他们把这些故事、这些传奇都拿来比较，发现其中有一种共同的模式：有一些强壮的英雄人物，为了赢得某样东西而踏上征途。

这些传说全都是这样。所有的传奇都是这样：强健的英雄人物踏上征途去赢得某样东西。而那篇文章令人惊讶地说了这一点：上一代在全世界范围内最了解这些古代神话与传说、能读原文等等的那位学者——比当时任何活着的人都更懂它们——就是牛津教授 J.R.R. 托尔金。那篇文章又说，第二，他太喜欢这些故事了，以至于想写一个属于他自己的。他想写一个关于征途的神话故事，他也确实写了；但第三，他深受基督信仰、深受基督福音的浸润，以至于他的故事几乎成了所有其他神话性远古传说的反题。因为每一个其他古老的传说，都是一个强者出去拯救世界——靠赢得某样东西。但在托尔金的故事里，也在福音里，拯救世界的是一个软弱的人：他借着失去而得胜；他踏上征途不是为了得到什么，而是为了失去什么。

你看，在历史的核心，在 h

我们心里的核心，是一位受苦的仆人——他借着失去而得胜，坠入黑暗，使我们得以活在光明中。也正因如此，耶稣的“追寻”不同于其他文化里那些自救、自我称义的追寻。也正因如此，有一位基督徒诗人爱德华·希利托（Edward Shillito）在对耶稣说话时这样对他说：别的神都强壮，你却软弱；他们乘骑而来，你却踉跄着走向你的宝座。

但唯有神的伤口，才能对我们的伤口说话；没有哪一位神有伤口，惟有你。别的神都强壮，你却软弱；他们乘骑而来，你却踉跄着走向你的宝座。唯有神的伤口，才能对我们的伤口说话；在任何宗教里都没有一位神有伤口，惟有你。简单之处正是难处；让我这样结束。

如果你正在探索基督信仰，或者你可能已经——你知道，你也许是在教会里长大，如今正试着思考：我与基督信仰的关系到底是什么？请听我一句：你要明白，从某种意义上说，理解“简单的难处”，并在其难处中把握这份简单，就是你成为基督徒的方式。你想知道怎样成为基督徒吗？你想知道怎样与神进入立约的关系吗？就是这个。

你会说，这很矛盾。你什么意思？我给你一个最典型的案例研究。1740年代，有一群年轻人，其实都属于教会。事实上，我想其中有些人还是按立的牧师。

他们在英国国教会，在伦敦，但他们知道自己缺了些什么。他们知道自己没有与神的个人关系；没有与神的立约关系；没有一颗新心。他们开始在晚上聚会，彼此为对方朗读路德《加拉太书》序言——马丁·路德为《加拉太书》所写的序言。

在连续几天、约一周左右的夜晚里，循道宗（卫理公会）的创始人约翰·卫斯理（John Wesley）、伟大的圣诗作者查尔斯·卫斯理（Charles Wesley）——他的弟弟——以及许多朋友都信主归正了。当他们忽然明白了神恩典那份简单之时，事情就豁然开朗；这里有一个

……有一位你可能没听过的名叫威廉·霍兰德（William Holland）的人，但他的经历正好是一个绝佳的例子。这是他日记里的记载。查尔斯·卫斯理（Charles Wesley）先生朗读到路德说的那句话时：“那么，我们就什么都不用做了吗？”

不，什么都不用做。只要接受那位从神而来、为我们成为智慧、公义、圣洁、救赎的主。紧紧抓住这些话的时候，有一种能力临到我，我几乎无法想象末了会如何描述。我心里充满了平安与爱，以至于我放声痛哭；后来我走到街上，几乎感觉不到脚下所踏的地。

发生的事是：恩典的单纯击中了他。而就在那一刻——就在你愿意付代价的时候：除掉你的骄傲，从此再也不能看不起任何人；也除掉你对自己人生的控制，因为你如今知道你欠祂一切，一切都出于祂的怜悯。若你愿意付这些代价，而恩典的单纯在那一刻临到——就在那一刻你正在成为基督徒，就在那一刻你进入与神的个人关系。你会说：“那如果我已经信了呢？你对我还有最后一句话吗？”当然有。

你里面的生命——那生命。神就是你的生命。因着耶稣，祂如今是你的生命。这是有保证的；这生命在你里面。

所以在歌罗西书第3章，保罗说；在约翰一书第3章，也谈到我们的生命与神一同藏着。我们的生命在神里面。我们其实甚至不知道自己将来会成为什么样；等到末日耶稣基督显现时，我们知道自己要像祂。我的意思是，这简直不可思议。

在你里面开始的那生命，就像一片海洋；你现在不过是将来的影子。C.S.刘易斯描述了你将来要成为什么样的人：要带着这样的盼望活着。祂要把我们当中最软弱、最污秽的人，塑造成光彩夺目、荣耀灿烂、不朽的受造物，里面涌动着一种我们如今无法想象的能力、喜乐、智慧与爱。

祂能使我们都成为明亮、无瑕的镜子，虽在较小的尺度上，却完美地把祂那无边的能力、喜悦与良善反照给神。这就是我们将要进入的。没有什么

让我们祷告。谢谢你，天父。

谢谢你，天父。借着耶稣基督，你可以成为我们的生命。我们感谢你把这生命栽种在我们许多人里面。我们感谢这生命在我们思想未来时所带给我们的盼望。我们也感谢福音那艰难却朴素的简单。

我们祈求你保守我们，不让骄傲使我们偏离，不让自命不凡让我们对它视而不见，不让自满使我们不去认真推演福音对我们生命每一个领域所带来的激进含义。所以我们求你现在帮助我们，真的借着耶稣基督领受你的生命。我们选择它。奉耶稣的名求，阿们。

今天早上的经文取自《申命记》30章11-20节。“我今日所吩咐你的诫命，并不是你难行的，也不是离你远的；不是在天上，使你说：‘谁替我们上天取下来，使我们听见可以遵行呢？’也不是在海那边，使你说：‘谁替我们过海取了来，使我们听见可以遵行呢？’不。

这话却离你甚近，就在你口中，在你心里，使你可以遵行。看哪，我今日将生与福乐、死与祸患，陈明在你面前。

我今日吩咐你要爱耶和华——你的神，遵行他的道，谨守他的诫命、律例、典章，你就必存活，人数增多；耶和华——你的神，必在你所要进去得为业的地上赐福与你。倘若你心里偏离，不肯听从，却被勾引去敬拜别神，事奉它们，我今日明明告诉你们，你们必要灭亡；在你过约旦河进去得为业的地上，你的日子必不长久。我今日呼天唤地向你作证：我将生死、祸福、咒诅与祝福都摆在你面前；所以你要选择生命，使你和你的儿女都得以存活；且要爱耶和华——你的神，听从他的话，专靠他。

因为耶和华是你的生命；他也必使你在那地上年日长久，就是他向你列祖起誓要赐给他们的地

，亚伯拉罕、以撒和雅各。这是主的话。

我们一直在看《申命记》，我们说过，这是一系列讲道，是摩西在他生命的最后时刻对他的百姓所讲的。如今我们真的来到了这一系列的末尾，也来到了他最后一篇讲道的结尾。在第16节我们看到，就在最后的最后，他说他是在“吩咐”。“吩咐”这个词的意思是，他在呼召、在郑重嘱托他的百姓进入与上帝立约的关系。

所以要爱耶和华你们的上帝，行祂的道；过去几周我们一直在看这一点：与上帝立约的关系非常个人，却又具有约束力，并且会使整个人生被更新改变。而在这里的最后，摩西只是说：进入与上帝立约的关系。

这段经文最有意思的一点，就是它的简单、它的基础。太基础了，太直截了当了。选择。

这就是你能做的一件事：做这个，不做那个；这样会带来这个，那样会带来那个。

如此简单。事实上，简单到一个地步，我还为此挣扎过一点。我到现在仍然在这段经文上挣扎，你知道为什么吗？传道人喜欢把一段难的经文讲得简单。

然后大家就会说：“哦，比我想的简单多了。他真棒。他真是个很好的老师。”对吧？我其实相信，我今天的工作是：面对一段极其简单的经文，反而要让你看见它的难处。而我相信，这正是摩西想要让我们看见的。

摩西开始说：看，我把这种与上帝的个人关系摆在你面前。他其实在说：这并不太难。它离你很近。你不必上到天上去，你不必渡海到那边去。

他其实是在说：我告诉你的这种简单，本身就是它的难处。人之所以错过与上帝立约的关系，正是因为它太简单了。简单就是难处。若你要真正得到它，你就必须正视：与上帝建立个人关系这件事，那种“艰难的简单”。

现在，让我们从三个方面来看这“艰难的简单”。

在这里我们会看到，当谈到这种个人的立约关系时

与神同在，它那种具有欺骗性的平凡，它那带着威胁的恩慈，以及那难以想象的应许。它的欺骗性——抱歉——它的平凡。它那带着威胁的恩慈，而同时又有那难以想象的应许。所以首先，我们来看看它的平凡，我说这平凡是带着欺骗性的。第14节说，这话——这进入与神建立个人关系的吩咐——离你很近。

然后他说，这是什么意思呢？理解它的一种方式是看第12节。他说，它不在天上，以至于你需要说：谁替我们上到天上把它取下来，传给我们，使我们可以遵行它呢？古代文化里，所有古人都相信，神圣的智慧、神圣的知识、宇宙的奥秘、生命意义的奥秘、如何生活的奥秘、死后会发生什么的奥秘——宇宙的奥秘都是很难找到的东西，因为神或众神很遥远，他们把牌紧紧攥在胸前，不轻易示人。

古代传说里充满了这样的人：特别有天赋、格外纯洁的人，在肉身或灵里升到天上，他们得着异象，或有来自其他维度的访客，他们领受晦涩的神谕般言语，然后把只有他们才拥有的真理拼凑出来。而摩西对此一点也不买账。他说“你不必上到天上去得着这话”，他在说什么？结合整卷《申命记》，他的意思是：那位“诸天与天上的天尚且容不下”的神，已经降下来了。他已经下到西奈山。

摩西一再说，神亲自降下来，把这些事告诉你，并从火中对你说话，你记得吗？那么摩西在说什么？如果你想要宇宙的奥秘，你不必成为专家式的精英科学家；你也不必极其老练、成为艺术家或诗人；你不必只在阿斯彭某个排他性的静修营里才能得到。

你不必攀登高山去得着它，你知道为什么吗？它几乎就在每一家旅馆房间的抽屉里。它已经在《圣经》中启示出来，而《圣经》无处不在。它是最容易接触的书，是全世界最容易拿到手的文本、文字、印刷品。到处都是，

而且不仅如此，不仅你不必攀上天堂，不仅它已经直接降到这里，随处可得，而且宇宙的奥秘 literally 就在你鼻子底下——就在你眼皮底下。

你住一间汽车旅馆的房间也好，住一间酒店的房间也好，宇宙的奥秘就在那间房里，而你甚至不知道。它如此平常。但我想，摩西说“离你不远”，不仅是指在物理上触手可及——就在这里：我的话在这里，书在这里，就在这里——同时也是在理解上、理智上可及的。因为圣经里当然有许多难懂的地方，我们也很喜欢坐下来琢磨它们是什么；但圣经一再、一再地强调，它的核心教导却是极其容易明白的。事实上，让我给你一个《申命记》的摘要——它讲的就是神希望你如何生活，并且如何与祂建立关系。

摘要如下：第一，爱神，把祂的旨意放在你自己的意愿之前。第二，无私地爱邻舍，把他们的需要放在你自己的需要之前。换句话说，不要只顾自己第一位，而要把神和邻舍放在你之前。第三，你会发现因此你将得着更丰盛的生命，你的心也会更充实；若你紧抓着自己的心、紧抓着自己的生命，想靠自己把它填满，它本不会如此。

这太简单了，太容易明白了，就在那里。摩西说，你不必上天去找，就在那里；它很普通，人人都知道，它就在你周围。就在你酒店的房间里——宇宙的奥秘。那问题出在哪里？它具有迷惑性，而且它在两方面都具有迷惑性。事实上有两种方式——嗯，对世界上仅有的两种人来说，它都是迷惑人的。

首先，有些人不相信，或很难相信圣经的信仰；他们不喜欢，或者很难接受；他们心里有各种疑难。其中一个原因就是这种“具有迷惑性的简单”。不信的人常常会被它的简单所迷惑，为什么？因为你猜怎么着？现代人有着与古人完全一样的问题。

我们以为如果有某

如果有什么东西真的、真的很重要，有一些洞见真的很重要，那它就得是才华横溢、精致成熟、走在前沿、又新又潮、性感吸睛。让我告诉你，《圣经》一点也不是这些东西，但它总有些什么。不过我要说，对我来说，一个警示性的例子是两周前《纽约时报》9月9日的纽约市版上登的一篇文章。文章讲的是曼哈顿最后一家培训精神科医生做精神分析（弗洛伊德式精神分析）的机构。最后一家——培训治疗师做弗洛伊德式精神分析的机构——他们在讨论这件事，并提到就在30年前、40年前，曼哈顿还有几十家、几十家这样的机构。我之所以对此如此着迷，其中一个原因是我知道：我大约20年前来到这里时，跟当时五六十岁的纽约人聊天，他们告诉我，在世纪中叶，凡是在纽约算得上人物的、精明懂行的、跟得上时代的人，都会每周两三次去做分析，而且一做就是好多年、好多年、好多年。人人都知道：就是这个，这就是我们进入内心的方法，这就是关键，这就是一切；如果你不懂这个，你就落伍了。而现在它死了，它黯然失色；你知道，它一点也不性感。可你猜怎么着，福音却在每一个街角都在；但总会有别的东西要来了，对吧？

要当心圣经信仰那种具有欺骗性的简单。它确实会让那些在信不下去的人感到困惑；但你猜怎么着，我们这些相信的人也同样会被这信仰的简单所冲击。你看看它，那它的核心是什么呢？嗯，你知道，它的核心是——卡尔·巴特（Karl Barth）其实是这样说的：“耶稣爱我，我知道；因为圣经这样告诉我。”就是这样。或者换句话说：你得救是本乎上帝的恩典；而新约补充说，是借着基督的牺牲。你看着这些就说：好吧，我听过了，我听过了，我知道，我明白，我懂了，我懂了。它太简单了，以至于几乎没有人真正抓住它那彻底颠覆性的含义。沃尔特·布鲁格曼（Walter Brueggemann）写了一本关于《申命记》的注释，我

在这一系列讲道中，我一直在用一个例子：在这段经文里，他看到摩西所说的那句话——“这话离你并不远，反在你近旁”，你知道，它很简单，很容易明白，也触手可及。而布鲁格曼在他的注释书那一处讲了一个引人入胜的真实故事。他是这样说的：另一个说明上帝的话语何等朴素明白的例子，就是二战期间法国勒尚邦（Le Chambon）的福音派基督徒群体，在纳粹灭绝行动中把犹太人藏起来。

这个山村的居民，在福音派教会和牧师的带领下，在极其危险的处境中，拯救了估计三千到五千名犹太人的生命。以色列在1990年将整个村庄认定为“列国义人”，表彰他们非凡的怜悯与勇气。所以他们一定是特别勇敢、高尚又有洞见的人，对吗？战后，一位当年在那儿得以存活、已长大的犹太人回来，采访了曾保护他的人，想知道他们为何要为他冒如此大的风险；他试图弄明白，你知道，秘诀是什么。令他惊讶的是，一个又一个人都只是耸耸肩——真的就是耸耸肩——说这似乎是他们对耶稣的信仰所带来的一个显而易见的含义。

他们没有什么戏剧性的解释；他们的行动出自他们拥抱福音的最核心——耶稣舍己之爱的福音——这就够了。现在布鲁格曼在说的是——而这点很有力量——这个记载提出了一个问题。基督信仰的核心中心是什么？耶稣基督舍命、牺牲自己的生命，为要拯救、爱、并饶恕那些不信他、甚至拒绝他的人，对吗？所以，这个小山村里的一小群法国福音派信徒就说：既然耶稣为我们做了那样的事，我们当然至少也该冒着生命危险去救这些人，不管他们是否像我们一样相信。只是从基督信仰、基督信息的基础出发，一个合乎逻辑的推论，不是吗？

难道欧洲每个人都不知道基督教的基本信息吗？难道欧洲每个人没见过十字架吗？难道欧洲每个人都没见过……

欧洲，你知道，大家都知道这个基本的故事吗？那他们为什么不都那样做呢？答案是：对我们来说太简单了。

所以你觉得这太简单了，而它确实太简单；但它的含义又极其浩大。正因为我们一看就觉得“这很简单”，我们就不会把它的深远含义想透，对吧？亲爱的朋友们，不要被圣经在这个主题上所说之事的平常性所迷惑——没有与神建立个人的关系。如果你正在探索基督信仰，请不要因为它的简单与平常而觉得被冒犯。如果你是基督徒，却说：“哦，我明白福音了，我懂福音了”，那恰恰证明你并不懂。它的难，在于它的简单；它的简单，也在于它的难。

你只有真正抓住这一点，才算真的明白。其次，不过，这还不止这些，这只是这种“艰难的简单”中的一部分。第二点：这里有一种带着威胁的恩典。你看，我们说过，当摩西说“这离你不远”时，意思是你不必上天去把它取来，因为它已经在圣经里启示出来了。但现在还有另一个想法。

他说：“我今日所吩咐你的”（第11节）并不太难，也不超出你的能力，为什么？“也不在海那边，使你要说：谁替我们过海取来，使我们听见可以遵行呢？”现在，在古代世界，“海”的比喻有点不同。“海”是混乱与毁灭的象征。事实上，保罗——我们稍后会再回到这里——在《罗马书》10章引用了整段经文。

但他在《罗马书》10章引用这段话时，把“海”称为“深渊”。顺便说一句，关于海有几部不错的电影。有一部讲海的好电影就叫《深渊》。因为在古代，人们把海代表为死亡、毁灭。航海的人比在陆地上的人脆弱得多。

所以海象征着深渊和死亡。那摩西在这里说的是什么呢？他说，因为古人和古代传说里充满了那些英勇高贵、踏上征途的英雄人物；他们出海远行。那“征途”可能是为了很多事情。

其中一个著名的就是《杰森与阿尔戈英雄》。它被拍成了很多部既糟糕又精彩的电影。这是个很棒的故事：讲的是杰森出海去……

阿尔戈英雄的故事：杰森出航去寻找金羊毛，那金羊毛由一条龙看守，他最终得到了金羊毛。但一路上危机重重，有许多谜题需要他解开。

一路历经重重险阻，他回来后得着了王国。类似的故事多得惊人，几乎所有文化、所有古代文明，不管在哪里，都有这种强大的人物形象：他们踏上跨海的征途，为要赢得一个王国或永生。我最喜欢的一部把这些古老传说“好莱坞化”的版本——而且真的改得很好——就是《夺宝奇兵》第三部。你还记得吗？印第安纳·琼斯和他做考古学家的父亲在寻找圣杯。

他们相信如果找到圣杯并从中饮用，就能得到永生。他们遭遇各种危险，也有线索，就像所有其他古老的故事一样——电影制作人其实很懂这些古老、前神话式的历史。你还记得那些线索是什么吗？第一，“神的气息”，只有悔罪的人才能通过。看吧，每一个都让你想起某个特效场面。

第二，“神的道”，只有踏着神的脚步他才能前行。第三，“神的道路”，只有从狮子头上纵身一跃，他才算证明自己的价值。这些故事讲的都是同一件事：你想得救吗？你想得永生吗？

你想要那个国度吗？线索、伟业、远征、跨海；纵身一跃，证明你的价值——而摩西完全不吃这一套。相反，他说——有意思就在这里——他说，不在海那边。你不用渡海去把它拿回来，什么？

那它到底在哪里呢？他说，它在你的口里，也在你的心里。心是你信的地方，口是你承认的地方；他在说什么？他是在说：与上帝的这种关系不是你去成就的，而是你去领受的。不是你要证明自己配得，你只是得着它。

因此他在说：与上帝的这种关系，不是你要上天去拿的，也不是你要渡海去取的；你不必去进行某种远征，不必成为某个英勇的战士；你是借着恩典领受它。现在，这就带着威胁性，

这就是我们对它的第二个问题。如果你想要一个完美的例子，而且这是个很好的例子，那就是《列王纪下》第5章里关于乃缦的圣经故事。《列王纪下》第5章告诉我们，乃缦是亚兰（叙利亚）的将军，患了大麻风；他知道若不得医治就必死无疑。他听说以色列的上帝以及祂的大能，于是决定去以色列，寻找先知以利沙，求得医治与拯救。

经文告诉我们他是怎样动身去做这事的，而他随身带去的东西表明他明白自己是在踏上一场寻求之旅。他带着金子和珍宝，准备买下、购得一切所需；他带着刀剑，预备行一件大事，因为他是个有本事、有勇武的人；他还带着他王的推荐信等等。等他到了先知的家，以利沙甚至不出来；相反，以利沙的仆人告诉他：去约旦河里洗一洗。

乃缦就怒不可遏，气冲冲地跑开了；他的仆人追上去，对他说：主人，主人，若先知吩咐你去做一件大事，你难道不就去做了吗？这正是重点。他和所有人一样——所有古代人、所有现代人都一样——如果有救恩，我们就要靠自己去成就；我们得证明自己的价值；我们得从狮子头上跳过去；我们得拔出宝剑；我们得做一件大功。他原本期待以利沙出来说：把西方坏女巫的扫帚柄带来。

他本会觉得那样可以接受。他说，你看，他在表达的意思是：我是个勇武的人，我是个富有、资源充足的人。若你说：去把西方坏女巫的扫帚柄取来，去从龙那里夺回金羊毛；或者要我用我的巨额财富买来医治和拯救；又或者要我靠屠龙赢得它——那都不算侮辱。但任何傻子都能在约旦河里洗，任何孩子都能在约旦河里洗。那样的上帝把得救的门槛放得这么低。

你知道，凯西和我还记得，第一个我曾与之分享福音信仰的人，是在我们的人生

……在弗吉尼亚州霍普韦尔那个小镇里，我第一次去那里做牧师，那时我才 24 岁。那是一位很年轻、真的很受伤的年轻母亲，领着救济金的单亲妈妈。我把福音分享给她，她说：不可能这么简单。你知道，就是同一件事。那样的上帝，怎么会把得救的门槛定得这么低。

但答案是：一方面，我们有一位极其包容的上帝，你有恩典；那是一道任何人都能跨过去的门槛——任何凶手、任何破碎的人、任何人都能跨过去，因为那是恩典的门槛。但它其实并不低。它有要求；它要求你失去你的骄傲。来吧，乃缦，你说这对我来说太低了。不，你根本没有跨过去，不是吗？为什么不呢？

因为它对你来说太高了：因为这里有两样——这免费恩典、这份邀请的恩慈——它要求你放下两样东西。第一，你要放下你一生中都自以为有权看不起别人的那种心态。你必须放下你的骄傲。你必须永远放下。

你不再有权去看着别人说：你们不懂，你们这些乌合之众，你们这些想要干净的，你们这些蠢人。这个国家之所以变成这样，都是你们的错。祂永远拿走了那种想法、那种骄傲，因为你必须说：我不过是个罪人，我需要靠恩典得救。你还必须放下的第二样，是对自己人生的掌控。因为你看，如果你曾经披挂上阵、如果你是在一场伟大的征途中赢得了你的救恩——赢得了天国或永生——那么上帝就不能随便向你要任何东西；你有你的权利。你做了你该做的。

但如果你把一切、一切、一切都交给祂的怜悯，那么你就欠祂一切。你再也不能在自己的生命里发号施令了，你明白吗？这令人难以置信的包容性，同时又有这免费恩典那令人畏惧的代价性。它如此简单，如此容易，以至于我们反而接受不了，我们被它威胁到了。你看见了吗？你看，这又是这种极其艰难的简单的另一个方面。这种令人不安的恩慈，我们的骄傲——因为我们的骄傲，福音那完全的恩慈会把我们击倒——别让它把你击倒，但我们还没讲完。

这困难的简单的第一方面

……城里那种具有欺骗性的平常感。第二个方面是那种带着威胁的恩典，但第三个方面是那难以想象的应许。我是什么意思？你们都是聪明人，这是纽约，所以你读这段经文的时候会意识到：我一直在强调这段经文的第一部分，看起来全都是在讲恩典。你不必上到天上，你不必渡过大海，它就在你口里、在你心里；你要心里相信、口里承认，它就在那儿，就在那儿。但你读到最后一部分时，却好像第二部分完全推翻了刚才所说的话，因为它说：你看，如果你的心转离、不听从；如果你被引诱去向别神跪拜、去敬拜它们——我今日向你们宣告，你们必定灭亡。

你们在那地上必不得长久存活。我今日呼天唤地向你们作见证：我将生与死、福与祸陈明在你们面前；要拣选生命，不然这一切咒诅都要临到你们。等一下，我们会说，等一下，这听起来好像我们又回到了“追求”的那一套，我们又得再“渡海”了。

因为我们已经一路看过来，整卷《申命记》里，我们看见我们该做什么，看见我们该怎样生活，看见我们该怎样对待上帝，看见我们该怎样对待其他所有人——而我们永远不可能时时刻刻都活得出来。我们永远不可能时时刻刻都活得出来。

所以，这段经文的第二部分似乎提出了一个巨大的难题，似乎与第一部分相矛盾，但其实并不矛盾。因为有一个注脚：还有盼望。

你知道这盼望是什么吗？就在最后一节——几乎是摩西最后的一个词——他在那里说：“因为耶和华是你的生命。”让我告诉你那里发生了什么，让我告诉你那是多么惊人的应许：这是圣经里第一次出现这样的说法，我想在整个旧约里也是最后一次。

你看，到目前为止，“生命”——我们说的不是生物学意义上的生命，对吧？

“拣选生命。”不是生物学意义上的生命，那他们在说什么呢？

？那是属灵的生命，是永恒的生命，是新心等等。上周我们已经讲过这些。所以，要选择生命。

到目前为止，生命总是与顺服连在一起，死亡与悖逆连在一起。你若顺服，就得生命；换句话说，你的顺服就是你的生命。你若不顺服，就得死亡；换句话说，你的悖逆就是你的死亡。所以，选择生命，就是要顺服。到现在为止，整卷书一直在对你说的就是这个：你的顺服就是你的生命。

每次提到“生命”这个词，提到属灵生命这件事，都是说：你若顺服，就得生命；你的顺服就是你的生命；你的顺服就是你的生命。可是在第20节，突然，突然，摩西在这里基本上是在说：你的顺服本可以成为你的生命，也可以成为你的生命；但因为它不能成为你的生命——因为你不会一直守得住——所以，耶和华要成为你的生命。这是什么意思？不是说你若顺服，主就赐你生命。这里不是这个意思。

这里说：主将成为你的生命，主自己就是你的生命。这是什么意思？保罗在《罗马书》第10章里解释了。在《罗马书》第10章，保罗向《罗马书》的读者——罗马人——宣讲耶稣基督的福音时，正是来到这段经文。他引用的就是这段经文，并且以一种最不可思议的方式来解读它。

他是这么说的。这是《罗马书》第10章。保罗说：“基督是律法的总结”，使凡信的人都得着义。至于这从信而来的义，摩西曾说（引文）：“你不要心里说：谁要升到天上去呢？那就是要领下基督来。”他又说：“谁要下到阴间去呢？那就是要领基督从无底坑里上来。”那么，经上到底怎么说呢？

摩西怎么说？他说：“这道离你不远，就在你口里，也在你心里。”这就是我们所传信主的道：你若口里认耶稣为主，心里信神叫他从死里复活，就必得救。你听见了吗？你看，首先他说：基督是律法的终结——但不是句号。

他说，基督是律法为义的终结。

律法仍然在那里，为的是讨神喜悦、改变你的生命；但它不再是你站在神面前、被算为义并蒙接纳的途径。我不知道吗？为什么不？耶稣下到了深渊。耶稣踏上了寻求永生的征途。摩西说——保罗说——摩西说，你不必上到天上去，因为耶稣已经从天降下。

保罗说——摩西说，你也不必渡海去，因为耶稣进到了海的深处；他担当了那些毁灭性的力量，承受了我们该受的毁灭。他把咒诅都揽在自己身上，他被毁灭了。他踏上了一场伟大的征途，他去完成那场寻求。他赢得了永生，如今把它当作礼物赐给我们。但我希望你知道一件事：耶稣基督的征途与历史上任何一场征途都不同。

几年前我读到一篇学术文章，真是让我大开眼界，令人惊叹。首先，它是一篇学术文章。作者是一位学者，试图从很宏观的角度考察并论述几乎所有不同文化中那些古老的神话式史前传说——无论是北欧的，还是地中海的、希腊罗马的，或是亚洲的。他们把这些故事、这些传说都拿来比较，发现其中都有一种共同的模式。也就是：你会看到一些强大的英雄人物，踏上征途去赢得某样东西。

它们几乎全是这个主题。所有传说都是这样：强大的英雄人物踏上征途去赢得某样东西。然后这篇文章令人惊讶地说了这样一件事：上一代里，对这些古代神话与传说了解得最多、在全世界最权威的那位学者，熟知原文等等——上一代里比任何仍在世的人都更了解这些神话与传说的人——竟然是 J.R.R.

托尔金，一位牛津教授。文章又说，第二，他如此热爱这些神话，以至于想写一部属于自己的。他想写一个关于“征途”的神话故事，他也确实写了；但第三，他被基督信仰深深浸润，也被基督教福音深深浸润，以至于他的故事几乎成了所有其他神话式史前传说的反题——这些传说曾经发生过的一切的反面。

d. 因为几乎所有其他古代传说里，都是一个强者出征去拯救世界——靠赢得某样东西来完成拯救。但在托尔金那里、也在福音里，世界却是被一个软弱的人物所拯救：他借着“失去”而得胜；他踏上征途不是为了获得什么，而是为了失去什么。

你看，在历史的核心、也在我们自己生命的核心，是一位受苦的仆人：他藉着失去而得胜；他坠入黑暗，好叫我们能活在光中。这就是耶稣的征途之所以不同于各文化里那些自救、为自己称义的征途的原因。也正因如此，有一位基督徒诗人爱德华·奇拉托（Edward Chilato）在向耶稣说话时这样对他说：

“别的神都强壮，惟你却软弱。
他们骑乘而来，你却踉跄着走向你的宝座。

惟有神的伤，才能对我们的伤说话；
没有一位神有伤，唯独你。”

“别的神都强壮，惟你却软弱。
他们骑乘而来，你却踉跄着走向你的宝座。
你……我们的伤，惟有神的伤才能说话；
在任何宗教里都没有一位神有伤，唯独你。”

简单之处就是难处。让我这样结束。

如果你正在探索基督信仰；或者你也许已经——你知道，你可能是在教会里长大的——如今你在思考：我与基督信仰到底是什么关系？我告诉你一件事：请你明白，从某个意义上说，要理解“简单的难处”；并在一切难处中抓住这份简单——这就是你成为基督徒的方式。你想知道怎样成为基督徒吗？你想知道怎样与神进入盟约关系吗？就是这个。

你会说：“这不是自相矛盾吗？你什么意思？”让我给你一个非常典型的案例。1740年代，有一群年轻人，他们其实都属于教会。事实上，我想其中有些人还是按立的牧师。

他们在英格兰教会里，也在伦敦，但他们知道缺了点什么。他们知道自己没有与神的个人关系；没有与神的盟约关系；没有一颗新心。于是他们开始了一系列晚间聚会，彼此朗读路德《加拉太书》序言，M

马丁·路德为《加拉太书》写的序言。

在大约一周左右的时间里，连续好几个夜晚，卫斯理弟兄——卫理公会的创始人约翰·卫斯理、伟大的圣诗作者查尔斯·卫斯理（他的弟弟），以及他们一大群朋友——都信主归正了。当他们突然明白了上帝恩典何等简单的时候，下面这位你大概从未听过的人——威廉·霍兰（William Holland）——的经历，就是所发生之事的一个绝佳例子。这是他日记里的记录。

查尔斯·卫斯理先生大声朗读；读到路德说“那么，我们就什么都不用做了吗？”那一段时——

“不，不用做什么。只要接受那一位：他是上帝使之成为我们的——并且在我们里面、为我们成为——智慧、公义、圣洁、救赎。”

当我紧紧抓住这些话时，有一种能力临到我，强烈到我几乎无法想象自己结局会如何被描述。我心里充满了平安与爱，以至于我放声痛哭；后来我走到街上去。我几乎感觉不到自己脚下所踏的地。

发生了什么？就是：恩典的简单直击了他。而那一刻——当这件事发生、当你也愿意付上代价：放下你的骄傲，从此以后再也不能看不起任何人；放下你对人生的掌控，因为你现在知道你欠祂一切——一切都因祂的怜悯。你若愿意付上这些代价，而恩典的简单就在那一刻临到你——那一刻你就正在成为基督徒，那一刻你就进入了与上帝的个人关系。

你会说：“那如果我已经相信了呢？你对我还有最后一句话吗？”当然有。

这生命——在你里面的生命。上帝就是你的生命。因着耶稣，祂如今是你的生命。这是保证的。祂在你里面。

所以《歌罗西书》第3章，保罗说；《约翰一书》第3章也说：我们的生命与基督一同藏在上帝里面。我们的生命在上帝里面。我们甚至并不知道自己将来会成为什么样子；但当耶稣基督在末日显现时，我们知道我们要像祂。我的意思是，这简直超乎想象。

你里面开始的那生命，不过像是一粒种子；你现在不过是将来自己的影子。C.S.路易斯也描绘了你将来会成为什么样子。要活在这样的盼望里：祂要使那最软弱、最污秽的……

他能把我们每一个人都变成令人目眩、光辉灿烂、永不朽坏的受造物，里面涌动着一种我们如今无法想象的能力、喜乐、智慧与爱。

他能使我们都成为明亮、无瑕的镜子，虽在较小的尺度上，却能完美地把他自己那无边的能力、喜悦与良善反照归给神。这就是我们将要进入的结局。绝不止于此。我们祷告。

谢谢你，父。

谢谢你，父。借着耶稣基督，你可以成为我们的生命。我们为你在我们许多人里面所栽种的生命向你感谢。我们为这生命在我们思想未来时所带来的盼望向你感谢。我们也为福音那艰难的简单向你感谢。

我们祈求你保守我们，不让我们的骄傲使我们偏离，不让我们的势利轻看它，不让我们的自满拦阻我们在生命的每一个领域活出福音那彻底的含义。因此，我们求你现在帮助我们，真的借着耶稣基督领受你的生命。我们选择它。奉耶稣的名求，阿们。

### 引言：信仰的开放性

当谈到公开你的信仰时，你有多自在？本月的播客中，Tim Keller 探讨了圣经对公开信仰的看法。他向我们展示了在多元化社会中，以一种创造文明、和平和与邻居有意义对话的方式公开我们的信仰是什么样的。

早上好。今天早上的经文取自《申命记》第30章第11-20节。

> “我今日所吩咐你的诫命不是你难以遵守的，也不是离你很远的。不是在天上，使你说，谁为我们上天取下来，使我们听见可以遵行呢？也不是在海外，使你说，谁为我们过海取来，使我们听见可以遵行呢？这话却离你甚近，就在你口中，在你心里，使你可以遵行。看哪，我今日将生与福，死与祸，陈明在你面前。吩咐你爱耶和华你的神，遵行他的道，谨守他的诫命、律例、典章，使你可以存活，人数增多，耶和华你神就必在你所要进去得为业的地上赐福与你。倘若你心里偏离不肯听从，却被勾引去敬拜事奉别神，我今日明明告诉你们，你们必要灭亡，在你过约旦河进去得为业的地上，日子必不长久。我今日呼天唤地向你作见证，我将生死、祸福陈明在你面前，所以你要拣选生命，使你和你的后裔都得存活，并且爱耶和华你的神，听从他的话，专靠他，因为他是你的生命，你的日子长久也在乎他。这样，你就可以在耶和华向你列祖亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各起誓应许赐给他们的地上居住。”

这是主的话。

### 约的简单性

我们一直在研究《申命记》，我们说这是摩西在他生命的最后对他的百姓所讲的一系列讲道，现在我们真的到了系列的结尾，也到了他最后一篇讲道的结尾。在第16节，我们看到在最后，他说，他命令，这个词命令意味着他在呼召或委托他的百姓与神建立约的关系。

**所以，主，你是神，行在他的道中，过去几周我们一直在看这个，与神的约关系是非常个人化的，但又是约束性的，并且是全生命转变的。** 在最后，摩西只是说，与神建立那种约的关系。

现在，这段经文最有趣的事情之一就是它的简单性和基本性。它是如此基本，如此直接。选择。这是你可以做的一件事。做这个。不要做这个。这会带来这个。那会带来那个。如此简单。

### 迷惑的平凡性

#### 1. 简单性作为挑战

事实上，它是如此简单。我实际上有点挣扎。我仍然在这段经文上挣扎，你知道为什么吗？传道人喜欢把一段难懂的经文变得简单。然后每个人都说，哦，比我想象的简单。他真棒。他是个很棒的老师，好吧。我实际上相信我的工作是今天把一段极其简单的经文展示出它的难度。我相信这就是摩西想要告诉我们的。

摩西开始说，看，我在向你提供这种与神的个人关系。他实际上在说，这并不难。它就在你身边。你不必上天。你不必越过海洋。他实际上在说，我告诉你的简单性就是它的难度。人们错过了与神的约关系，因为它太简单了。**简单性就是它的难度。**

#### 2. 神话语的可及性

第14节说，这个词，这个进入与神个人关系的命令就在你身边。然后他说，这是什么意思？

好吧，理解这一点的方法之一是第12节。他说，这不是在天上，以至于你必须说，谁会上天去取下来并向我们宣告，以便我们可以遵行。

现在，古代文化，所有古代人民都相信神圣的智慧，神圣的知识，宇宙的秘密，生命意义的秘密，如何生活的秘密，死后会发生什么的秘密。宇宙的秘密是难以找到的东西，因为神或众神是遥远的，他们把牌藏在胸前。

古代传说充满了特别有天赋的纯洁的人，他们在身体或精神上升到天堂，他们有异象，或者他们有来自其他维度的访客，他们得到隐晦的神谕言辞，他们拼凑出只有他们拥有的真理。而摩西对此毫不接受。

当他说，你不必上天去得到这个时，他在说什么？他说，因为神，整本《申命记》都在说，天和最高的天都无法容纳的神，已经降临。他降临在西奈山。摩西一再说，神亲自降临并告诉你这些事情，并从火中对你说话，记得吗？

那么摩西在说什么？如果你想要宇宙的秘密，你不必是一个专家精英科学家。你也不必是一个非常复杂的艺术家诗人。你不只是在阿斯彭的一个独家静修会上得到它。你不必爬山去得到它，你知道为什么吗？它几乎在每个酒店房间的抽屉里。它在圣经中揭示，圣经无处不在。它是最容易获得的书籍，是世界上最容易获得的文本，书面东西和印刷品。

### 威胁的恩典

#### 1. 恩典的简单性

现在，你看，我们说，当摩西说，这在你身边，意思是你不必上天去得到它，因为它在圣经中揭示。但现在这里有另一个想法。他说，我今天所吩咐你的，11节，并不难以遵守，也不超出你的能力，为什么？它不在海洋之外，以至于你必须问，谁将越过海洋去得到它？

现在，海洋在古代世界中是一个有点不同的隐喻。海洋是混乱和毁灭的象征。事实上，保罗，我们会回到这一点，保罗在《罗马书》第10章中引用了这整段经文。但当他在《罗马书》第10章中引用这段经文时，他称海洋为深渊。当然，还有几部好电影，顺便说一下。有一部关于海洋的好电影叫《深渊》。因为在古代，海洋代表死亡，毁灭。航海者比陆地上的人更脆弱。因此，海洋代表深渊和死亡。

#### 2. 拿阿曼的故事

如果你想要一个完美的例子，这是一个很好的例子，是《列王纪下》第5章中拿阿曼的圣经故事。在《列王纪下》第5章中，我们被告知拿阿曼是一个叙利亚将军，他患了麻风病，他知道如果不治愈他就会死，他听说了以色列的神和他的力量。所以他决定去以色列，找到先知以利沙，寻求他的医治和拯救。

文本告诉我们他如何出发，以及他带来的东西显示他理解自己在进行一场探险。他带着金子和宝藏去购买他必须购买的任何东西。他带着剑，准备做一件伟大的事，因为他是一个有勇气和英勇的人。他带着国王的推荐信，等等，他到达先知的房子，以利沙甚至没有出来。相反，他被以利沙的仆人告知，去约旦河洗澡。

拿阿曼愤怒地跑开了，他的仆人追上他，他们说，主人，主人，如果先知告诉你做一件伟大的事，你难道不会去做吗？这就是重点。他就像所有人，所有古代人，所有现代人。如果有拯救，我们将实现它，我们必须证明我们的价值，我们必须从狮子的头上跳跃，我们必须拔出剑，我们必须做一些伟大的事。

### 不可思议的应许

#### 1. 生命的应许

我的意思是什么？你们是聪明人，这是纽约，所以如果你在读那段经文，你会意识到我一直在集中在经文的第一部分，这似乎全是关于恩典的。你不必上天，你不必越过海洋，它就在你的口中和心里，你必须在心里相信并用口承认，它在那里，它就在那儿，但然后你到达最后一部分，似乎第二部分完全与刚才所说的相矛盾，因为它说，你看，如果你的心偏离而你不顺服，如果你被引诱去敬拜其他神，我今日明明告诉你，你必定被毁灭。

#### 2. 耶稣的角色

保罗在《罗马书》第10章中解释了这一点。在《罗马书》第10章中，保罗在向《罗马书》的读者宣讲耶稣基督的福音时，来到这段经文。他来到这段经文，并以最不可思议的方式解释了这段经文。这是他说的。这是《罗马书》第10章。基督是律法的终结，保罗说，作为每个相信者的义的手段。

> “现在关于通过信仰而来的义，摩西说，引用，不要在心里说，谁将升到天上，因为那将把基督带下来。他说，不要说谁将降到深渊，因为那将把基督带上来，但它说什么？摩西说，话语就在你身边，在你的口中和心里，那就是我们所宣讲的信心的话语，如果你用口承认耶稣是主，并在心里相信神使他从死里复活，你就必得救。”

你听到了吗？看，首先，他说，基督是律法的终结，不是句号。他说，基督是义的律法的终结。它仍然存在以取悦神，改变你的生活，但不再是站在神面前的手段，义和接受，不是吗？为什么不呢？耶稣进入了深渊。耶稣为了永生而进行了探险。

### 结论

如果你正在探索基督教，或者如果你可能已经来到，你知道，你可能是在教会中长大的，现在你正在思考，好吧，我与基督教的关系是什么？告诉我的话，请意识到，在某些方面，理解简单性的难度，并在其所有难度中掌握简单性是你成为基督徒的方式。你想知道如何成为基督徒吗？你想知道如何与神建立约的关系吗？就是这样。

**你说，那是矛盾的。你是什么意思？给我一个完美的案例研究。**

在1740年代，有一群年轻人，他们实际上都是教会的一部分。事实上，我认为他们中的一些人是被任命的牧师。他们在伦敦的英格兰教会，但他们知道有些东西缺失了。他们知道他们没有与神的个人关系。他们没有与神的约关系。他们没有

新的心。他们开始举行一系列晚间聚会，在聚会上彼此朗读马丁·路德《加拉太书》序言。大约一周之内，约翰·卫斯理——循道宗（卫理公会）运动的创始人——查尔斯·卫斯理（伟大的圣诗作者、他的兄弟），以及他们的许多朋友都归信了。

当“恩典的简单”真正落在一个人身上时，会发生什么？这里有一个你可能没听过的人——威廉·霍兰德——这是个完美的例子。以下摘自他的日记：

> “查尔斯·卫斯理先生大声朗读，读到路德说：我们需要做什么吗？不，什么也不需要。只要接受祂——神为我们所成就的一切：祂成了我们的智慧、公义、圣洁和救赎。听见这些话时，有一种能力临到我身上，我几乎无法想象，更难以描述。我的心充满了平安与爱，以至于我流下眼泪；后来我走到街上，几乎感觉不到自己脚下所踏的地面。”

当时发生的，就是“恩典的简单”击中了他。那一刻之所以发生，是因为他愿意付代价：放下骄傲，说“从今以后，我再也不能轻看任何人”；也放弃对自己人生的控制，因为你如今知道你欠祂一切，一切都完全系于祂的怜悯。若你愿意付这样的代价，“恩典的简单”就在那一刻发生——你就在那一刻成为基督徒，就在那一刻进入与神的个人关系。

你说：“好吧，如果我已经信了呢？你还有最后的话要对我说吗？”当然有。生命——生命在你里面。神就是你的生命。因着耶稣，如今祂就是你的生命。这是确定无疑的：祂在你里面。这也是保罗在《歌罗西书》第三章以及《约翰一书》第三章所说的——我们的生命与基督一同藏在神里面。我们的生命在神里面。我们真不知道将来会成为什么；但当耶稣基督在末日显现时，我们知道自己将要像祂。我是说，这超出人的想象。如今在你里面开始的生命，只是一粒种子；你现在不过是你将来所成为之人的影子。

**看看路易斯如何描述你将要成为的样子。要活在这样的盼望里：祂将把我们中最软弱、最污秽的人，变成耀眼的不朽生命，充满我们如今无法想象的能量、喜乐、智慧与爱。祂能使我们所有人成为明亮、无瑕的镜子——虽在较小的尺度上，却能完美地把神那无边的能力、喜乐与良善反射出来。这就是我们所期待的；没有别的。**

我们一起祷告。

父啊，谢谢你。父啊，谢谢你。藉着耶稣基督，你可以成为我们的生命。我们感谢你在我们许多人里面种下生命；我们感谢你赐给我们的盼望，使我们思想自己的将来；我们感谢你福音那“艰难的简单”。我们求你：不要让我们因骄傲而被拒绝在恩典之外，不要让我们因自负而忽视它，也不要让我们因自满而拦阻福音在我们生命每个领域里产生那激进、彻底的影响。

因此我们求你，现在就帮助我们，藉着耶稣基督真实地领受你的生命。我们选择它。奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。

## Chinese Transcript / 中文

今天早晨的经文取自《申命记》三十章11—20节。如今，我今日所吩咐你的，并不是你觉得太难、也不是你力不能及的。它不在天上，使你不得不说：谁替我们上到天上取下来，传给我们，使我们可以听见而遵行呢？它也不在海那边，使你不得不说：谁替我们渡过海去取来，传给我们，使我们可以听见而遵行呢？不。

这话离你甚近，就在你口中，在你心里。不。你可以遵行。看哪，我今日将生与福乐、死与祸患陈明在你面前。

我今日吩咐你，要爱耶和华你的神，行祂的道，谨守祂的诫命、律例、典章，你就必存活，人数增多；耶和华你的神也必在你进去要得为业的地上赐福与你。倘若你心里偏离，不肯听从，却被勾引去敬拜别神、事奉它们，我今日明明告诉你们，你们必要灭亡；你们过约旦河进去要得为业的地上，你们的日子必不长久。今日我呼天唤地向你作见证：我将生与死、福与祸摆在你面前；所以你要拣选生命，使你和你的后裔都得存活，并且你要爱耶和华你的神，听从祂的声音，专靠祂。

因为耶和华是你的生命；祂必使你在祂起誓要赐给你列祖亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各之地上年日长久。这是耶和华的话。我们一直在看《申命记》，并且我们说过，这是摩西在他生命将尽之时，向他的百姓所讲的一系列讲道；如今我们确实已经到了这系列的末尾，也到了他最后一篇讲道的末尾

而在第16节，我们看到在最后最后，他说的是一种命令；“命令”这个词的意思是，他在呼召或嘱托他的百姓，进入与神立约的关系。

所以，“耶和华是你的神，你要行在他的道中”。过去几周我们一直在看这一点：与神的立约关系非常个人，却又具有约束力，并且会改变人的整个人生。而在这里的末了，摩西只是说：进入那与神立约的关系。现在，这段经文最有意思的一点，就是它的简单和基础。它太基础了，太直接了。选择。

这就是你能做的一件事：做这个；不要做那个。这样会带来这个；那样会带来那个。

太简单了。事实上，它简单到让我有点挣扎。我到现在仍然在这段经文上挣扎，你知道为什么吗？传道人喜欢把一段很难的经文讲得简单。

然后大家就说：“哦，比我想的更简单。”他真了不起。他真是个好老师，懂吗？我其实相信，我今天的工作，是把一段极其简单的经文，反而把它的困难显明出来。我相信这正是摩西想向我们指出的。

摩西开始说：“看，我在把这与神的个人关系摆在你们面前。”而他其实是在说：这并不太难；它就在你近旁。你不必上到天上，也不必渡过海洋。

他是在说：我告诉你们的这件事之所以简单，正是它的困难所在。人之所以错过与神的立约关系，是因为它太简单了；简单本身就是它的困难。而你若要真正得着它，就必须正视：与神建立个人关系这件事那“困难的简单”。现在，让我们从三个方面来看这“困难的简单”。

我们将看到：当谈到这与神的个人立约关系时，它有迷惑性的平常、带着威胁的恩典，以及不可想象的应许。它的迷惑性——抱歉，是它迷惑性的平常；它带着威胁的恩典；以及它不可想象的应许。所以首先，让我们来看它的平常性，我说这是带着迷惑性的。第14节说：“这句话，这个 ch”

……使你进入与上帝建立个人关系的道路就在你身边。

然后他说，这是什么意思呢？理解它的一个方式是看第12节。他说：“这命令不在天上，使你说：‘谁替我们上到天上取下来，传给我们，使我们遵行呢？’”在古代文化里，几乎所有古人都相信：神圣的智慧、神圣的知识——宇宙的奥秘、生命意义的奥秘、如何生活的奥秘、死后将会发生什么的奥秘——都是很难找到的，因为上帝或诸神遥不可及，他们把牌紧紧捂在胸前。

古代传说里充满了这样的人：一些格外有天赋、特别纯洁的人，在身体或灵里升到天上，看见异象；或者有来自其他维度的访客；他们得到隐晦、神谕式的话语，然后把只有他们才拥有的真理拼凑出来。摩西完全不接受这种说法。当他说“你不必上到天上去把这话取下来”时，他在说什么？他是在说：那位连天和天上的天都容不下的上帝——整卷《申命记》都在强调这一点——已经降下来了。他降到了西奈山。

摩西一再说，是上帝亲自降下来，把这些事告诉你，并在火中对你说话——你还记得吗？那么摩西在说什么？如果你想知道宇宙的奥秘，你不必成为专家、精英科学家；也不必是极其老练的艺术家、诗人；你也不是只能在阿斯彭那种封闭的高端静修营里才得到它。

你不必爬上一座山去获得它，你知道为什么吗？因为它几乎就在每一间酒店房间抽屉里。它已经在《圣经》中启示出来，而《圣经》到处都是。它是最容易接触到的书，是全世界最容易拿到手的文本、文字与印刷品。它无处不在。不但你不必上到天上去——不但它已经降到这里、随处可得——而且宇宙的奥秘简直就在你鼻子底下，就在你眼前。

你住进一家汽车旅馆，你住进一家酒店，宇宙的奥秘就在那间酒店的抽屉里。

你每天都在与它擦肩而过，却甚至没有意识到。它太普通了。

但我想，摩西说“它离你很近”不仅是指它在物理上触手可及。你看，这里就是——我的话在这里，书在这里，就在你眼前；它也在智性上触手可及，因为当然，《圣经》里有许多东西难以理解，我们也喜欢坐下来琢磨它们到底是什么意思。但《圣经》一再一再强调的那些核心教导，却出奇地容易理解、出奇地清晰。

事实上，让我给你一个《申命记》的概要。《申命记》整卷书都在讲上帝希望你如何生活、如何与祂建立关系。

下面是摘要：第一，爱上帝，把祂的旨意置于你自己的意愿之上。第二，无私地爱你的邻舍，把他们的需要置于你自己的需要之上。换句话说，不要只顾自己，把上帝放在第一位，把邻舍放在第一位。第三，你会因此发现：你的生命会丰富得多，你的心会充实得多——远超过你死死抓住自己的心、抓住自己的生活、试图靠自己把它填满时所能得到的。

这太简单了，这很容易获得，就在那里。摩西说，你不必上到天上去，它就在眼前；它很普通，人人都知道，它无处不在。就在你的旅馆房间里——宇宙的奥秘。那问题出在哪里呢？它具有迷惑性，而且它在两方面迷惑人。事实上，对于世界上仅有的两类人来说，它都是迷惑性的。

首先，有一些人不相信——或者很难相信——《圣经》的信仰；他们不喜欢它，或者对它感到为难，心里有许多疑问。其中一个原因就是这种“迷惑性的简单”。不信的人常常被它的简单所迷惑，为什么呢？你猜怎么着？现代人的问题，和古人一模一样。

我们总觉得：如果某件事真的、真的很重要；如果某个洞见真的很重要，那它一定得聪明绝顶、复杂精妙、走在最前沿、新颖又性感。我告诉你，《圣经》并不是这些东西中的任何一种——不过它总有别的东西。但我跟你说，对我来说一个极具警醒意味的故事，是9月9日《纽约时报》ci

就在两周前。《纽约时报》有一篇文章讲到曼哈顿最后一家训练精神科医生从事精神分析——弗洛伊德式精神分析——的机构。最后一家训练治疗师做弗洛伊德式精神分析的机构。他们在谈这件事时提到，就在三十年前、四十年前，曼哈顿还有一打又一打这样的机构。我之所以对那篇文章特别感兴趣，其中一个原因是：我知道我大概二十年前来到这里时，跟一些当时五十多岁或六十多岁的纽约人交谈，他们告诉我，在本世纪中叶，凡是有头有脸的纽约人、凡是精明的人、凡是稍微跟得上潮流的人，都会去做分析——一周两三次——持续好多好多年。人人都知道：就是这个，这就是我们要进入内心的方法，这才是关键，这就是一切；如果你不懂这个，你就落伍了。而现在它死了，像日食一样消失了；你知道，它变得一点也不性感了。可你猜怎么着？福音却在每一个街角都在出现；但是又有别的东西正在到来，对吧？

要当心圣经信仰那种迷惑人的“简单”。这会让那些难以相信的人很受冲击；但你猜怎么着，这信仰的简单同样也会冲击我们这些已经相信的人。你看它，会问：它的核心是什么？嗯，你知道，它的核心就是——卡尔·巴特其实是这么说的——“耶稣爱我，我知道，因为圣经告诉我”，就这么简单。或者换一种说法：你是靠着上帝的恩典得救，而新约又补充说，是借着基督的牺牲。你看着这一切会说：好吧，我听过，我听过，我知道了，我懂了，我懂了。它是如此简单，以至于几乎没有人真正把它那颠覆性的含义抓住。沃尔特·布鲁格曼写过一部《申命记》注释，我在这一系列讲道中一直在用。在他注释这段经文时，他看到摩西说“这话离你不远，就在你近旁”——你知道，很简单，很容易接近——布鲁格曼在他注释的那个地方讲了一个引人入胜的故事，一个真实的故事。以下是他所说的：

上帝的话语何等直白、何等简单，还有一个例证：二战期间，法国勒尚邦（Le Chambon）的福音派基督徒群体在纳粹试图灭绝犹太人的行动中藏匿犹太人。

这个山村的居民在福音派教会和牧师的带领下，在极其危险的处境中，救了估计三千到五千名犹太人的性命。1990年，以色列国认可整个村庄为“列国义人”，表彰他们非凡的怜悯与勇敢。所以，他们一定是格外勇敢、高尚、而且富有洞见的人，是吗？战后，一位当年在那儿得以存活、如今已成年的犹太人回到村里，采访那些保护过他的人，询问他们为何愿意为他冒如此大的风险；他想弄明白，你知道，那秘诀是什么？令他惊讶的是，一个接一个的人都只是耸耸肩——真的就是耸耸肩——说这不过是他们对耶稣的信仰所显而易见的含义。

他们没有任何戏剧性的解释；他们的行动源自他们拥抱福音的最核心——耶稣舍己之爱的福音——这就够了。现在，伯格曼所说的——而且这是一个极有力的观点——这个故事引出了一个问题。基督信仰的核心中心是什么？耶稣基督为拯救、爱与饶恕那些不信他、拒绝他的人，献上了自己的生命，牺牲了自己的生命，对吗？所以，这群法国福音派基督徒在这个小小的山村里说：既然耶稣为我们都这样做了，我们至少也应该冒着生命危险去救这些人——不管他们是否像我们一样相信。只是对基督信仰、基督信息最基本内容的一个合乎逻辑的推论，对吧？

难道欧洲每个人都不知道最基本的基督信息吗？难道欧洲每个人都见过十字架吗？难道欧洲每个人，你知道，都听过那个最基本的故事吗？那为什么他们都没有这样做？答案是：这对我们来说太简单了。

所以你觉得这太简单了，而它确实太简单；但其中的含义却极其广阔。正因为我们看它这么简单，我们就不去把它的含义想透，对吧？亲爱的朋友们，不要被 t 所迷惑

《圣经》在这个主题上所说的那种平常、普通——并不是与上帝建立一种个人关系。如果你正在探索基督信仰，请不要因为它的简单与平常而感到被冒犯。如果你是基督徒，却说：哦，我明白福音了，我懂福音了——那恰恰证明你并不懂。它的难处在于它的简单；它的简单也正是它的难处。

你直到真正抓住这一点，才算真正明白。其次，不过，这还不是全部，这只是这种“困难的简单”其中一部分。第二，这里面有一种带着威胁的恩慈。你看，我们说过，当摩西说“这离你不远”时，意思是你不必上到天上去把它取下来，因为它已经在《圣经》中启示出来了。但现在还有另一个想法。

他说：“我今日所吩咐你的”（第11节）并不太难，也不在你能力所及之外，为什么？“这也不在海那边，使你说：谁替我们过海取了来？”然而，在古代世界，“海”是一个略有不同的隐喻。海象征混乱与毁灭。事实上，保罗——我们还会回到这一点——在《罗马书》10章引用了这整段经文。

但他在《罗马书》10章引用这段话时，把“海”称为“深渊”。顺便说一句，当然也有几部不错的电影。有一部关于海的好电影就叫《深渊》。因为在古代，海代表死亡、毁灭。航海者比陆地上的人脆弱得多。

因此，海代表深渊与死亡。那么摩西在这里说的是什么呢？他说，因为古人以及古代传说里充满了那些踏上征途的英雄豪杰。他们出海远行。而这场征途的目标可以有很多种。

其中一个很经典的例子是《杰森与阿尔戈英雄》。它被拍成过许多很烂但也很精彩的电影。那是个很棒的故事：杰森与阿尔戈英雄们出发，寻找一件被巨龙看守的金羊毛，他最终得到了金羊毛。但途中有许多险境，有许多谜题要解。

他经历许多危险，归来并赢得王国。而类似的故事数量极其庞大，几乎遍布所有文化中，

所有古代文化，无论在哪里，都有这些强有力的人物，他们踏上海上远征，去赢得一个国度或得到永生。我最喜欢的、好莱坞式改编的这些古老传奇版本——而且确实是个很不错的好莱坞版本——就是《夺宝奇兵》系列的第三部。你还记得印第安纳·琼斯和他身为考古学家的父亲去寻找圣杯的那段吗？

他们相信，如果找到了圣杯并从中饮用，就能获得永生。一路上有危险，也有线索，就像所有其他古代故事一样；电影创作者其实很懂那些古老的、前神话式的历史叙事。你还记得那些线索是什么吗？第一，“上帝的气息”，只有悔改的人才能通过。看，每一个都让你想起另一种特效。

第二，“上帝的话语”，只有踏着上帝的脚步他才能前行。第三，“上帝的道路”，只有从狮子头上纵身一跃，他才能证明自己的价值。而这些故事讲的就是这个：你想要拯救吗？看，你想要永生吗？

你想要那个国度吗？线索、伟大、远征、跨越大海。纵身一跃，证明你的价值——但摩西一点也不吃这一套。相反，他说——这就很有意思——他说：不在海那边。你不必渡海去得着它，什么？

那它到底是什么呢？他说：就在你的口里，也在你的心里。你的心是你相信的地方，你的口是你承认的内容；他在说什么？他说：与上帝的这种关系不是你去成就的，而是你去领受的。不是你去证明自己配得，你只是得着它。

因此他在谈论的是：与上帝的这种关系，不是你上到天上去得着，也不是你渡海去得着；你不必踏上一场什么远征，不必成为某种英勇的战士；你是凭恩典领受它的。现在这很具威胁性，这也是我们对它的第二个问题。若你想要一个完美的例子——而这确实是个很好的例子——就是《列王纪下》第5章里乃缦的故事。《列王纪下》第5章告诉我们，乃缦是亚兰（叙利亚）的将军，他患了麻风；他知道如果不被医治，他就会死

他得了麻风，也听说了以色列的神以及祂的大能。于是他决定前往以色列，去找先知以利沙，寻求医治与拯救。

经文告诉我们，他是怎样出发去做这件事的；他所带着的一切也显明他明白自己是在进行一场“求取”的远征。他带着金子和财宝，预备不惜代价买到、换到他必须得到的东西。他带着刀剑，准备立下大功，因为他是个有本领、有勇武的人。他还带着国王写的推荐信等等。等他到了先知的家，以利沙甚至不出来见他；他只是从以利沙的仆人那里得到一句话：你去约旦河里洗。

于是乃缦大怒，怒气冲冲地转身离开。他的仆人追上去，对他说：主人，主人！若先知吩咐你做一件大事，难道你不会去做吗？这正是关键。他和所有人一样——古代人如此，现代人也如此——如果有拯救，我们就要靠自己去赢得它；我们得证明自己的价值；我们得从狮子的头上跳过去；我们得拔出刀剑；我们得做一件大事。他原以为以利沙会出来说：“把西方恶女巫的扫帚柄拿来给我。”

而他本来会——他在说的就是这个意思——他说：“你看，我是个有勇武的人，我是个富有、能办事的人。若你说：去取西方恶女巫的扫帚柄，去从龙那里夺来金羊毛；若你要我用巨大的财富买来医治与拯救，或要我靠杀死一条龙来赢得它，这都不会冒犯我。但任何傻子都能在约旦河里洗，任何孩子都能在约旦河里洗。这样的神把拯救的门槛设得太低了。”

你知道，凯西和我记得，我第一次在弗吉尼亚州霍普韦尔那个小镇分享福音信仰的对象，是一位非常受伤的年轻母亲——领救济的单身妈妈。我把福音讲给她听，她说：“不可能这么容易。”你看，一样的反应。这样的神会把拯救的门槛设得太低了。

但答案是，一方面

朋友们，我们有一位上帝，他的包容性大得不可思议：你得着的是恩典——那是一道任何人都能跨过去的门槛；任何杀人犯、任何破碎的人，都能跨过去，因为那是恩典的门槛。但它其实并不低；它有要求，它要求并且需要你放下你的骄傲。来吧，乃缦，你说这对我来说太低了。不，其实你并没有跨过去，是吗？为什么不？

它对你来说太高了，因为这白白的恩典、这份邀请的恩慈，有两样东西要求你放弃。有一样是：你一生都不再有资格去轻看任何人。你必须放下你的骄傲，你必须永远把它放下。

你不再有资格看着任何人说：“你不懂，你们这些乌合之众；你们还想要清白，你们这些蠢人。这个国家变成这样都是你们的错。”它永远夺走这种想法——那种骄傲，因为你必须说：“我不过是个罪人，我需要靠恩典得救。”你还必须放弃的另一件事，是对你人生的掌控。因为你看，如果你曾经出征，如果你曾靠着一场伟大的征途赢得了救恩、赢得了国度或永生，那么上帝就不能随意向你要求什么；你有你的权利，你已经做了你该做的。

但如果你把一切、一切、一切都交在他的怜悯之下，你就欠他一切。你再也不能在自己的人生里发号施令了，你明白吗？这恩典何等包容，同时又何等具有威胁性的代价——上帝白白的恩典，就是如此：它如此简单，如此容易，以至于我们反而接受不了；我们被它威胁。你看到了吗？你看，这是这“极其艰难的简单”另一个层面。这令人不安的恩慈，会触动我们的骄傲；因着我们的骄傲，福音那绝对的白白恩典使我们不知所措——别让它把你弄得失去分寸——但我们还没讲完。

这“艰难的简单”的第一方面，是那具有欺骗性的平凡。第二方面，是那带着威胁的恩慈；第三方面，是那难以想象的应许。

我是什么意思？你们都是聪明人，这里是纽约，所以当你读那段经文时，你会意识到：我一直在专注于经文的前半部分，而那部分似乎

这一切都在讲恩典。你不必上到天上，你不必渡过海洋，它就在你口里、在你心里；你要心里相信、口里承认，它就在那里，就在你眼前。可是当你读到最后一段时，似乎第二部分完全与刚才所说的相矛盾，因为它说：你看，如果你的心偏离，你不顺服；如果你被引诱去向别神跪拜、敬奉它们，我今日宣告你们：你们必定灭亡。

你们必不得在那地上长久居住。今日我呼天唤地向你们作见证：我将生与死、福与祸陈明在你们面前；你们要选择生命，不然这一切咒诅都要临到你们。等一下，我们会说，等一下，这不就又回到“去寻求”的那一套了吗？又回到要渡海那一套了吗？因为我们已经一路读过申命记全书，我们看见我们该做什么，我们看见我们该怎样生活，我们看见我们该怎样欺哄上帝，我们看见我们该怎样对待每一个人——而我们永远不可能时时刻刻都做到。我们永远不可能时时刻刻都做到。

所以，这段经文的第二部分似乎提出了一个巨大的难题，似乎与第一部分相矛盾，但其实并不矛盾。因为有一句提示：仍有盼望。你知道盼望是什么吗？在最后一节，就在摩西几乎最后的那句话里，他说：“因为耶和华是你的生命。”让我告诉你那里发生了什么，让我告诉你那是多么不可思议的应许——这是圣经里第一次出现这样的陈述，我想也是整个旧约里最后一次。

你看，到目前为止，“生命”——我们说的不是生物学意义上的生命，对吧？

选择生命。这不是生物学的生命，那他们在说什么？是属灵的生命，是永恒的生命，是新心等等。上周我们讲过。所以，要选择生命。

在此之前，生命与顺服相连，死亡与悖逆相连。你若顺服，就得生命；换句话说，你的顺服就是你的生命。你若不顺服，就会得

死亡，换句话说，你的悖逆就是你的死亡。所以要选择生命，就要顺服。直到如今，整本书一路下来都是这样告诉你：你的顺服就是你的生命。

每一次“生命”这个词、属灵生命这件事被提起时，它都说：如果你顺服，你就会得着生命；你的顺服就是你的生命；你的顺服就是你的生命。但到了第20节，忽然，忽然之间，摩西在这里基本上说：你的顺服本可以成为你的生命，也可能成为你的生命；但因为它不可能成为你的生命——因为你不会坚持到底——主将成为你的生命。这是什么意思？不是说你若顺服，主就会赐你生命。它说的不是这个。

它说“主将成为你的生命”，主自己要成为你的生命。这是什么意思？保罗在《罗马书》10章里解释了这一点。在《罗马书》第10章，当保罗向罗马书的读者、向罗马人宣讲耶稣基督的福音时，他就来到这段经文，并且以一种最令人难以置信的方式来解读它。

他是这样说的。这是《罗马书》10章。保罗说：“基督是律法的终结”，不是句号。他说：“基督是律法的终结，为要使凡信的人都得着义。”至于这因信而来的义，摩西曾说——引文如下——“你心里不要说：谁要升到天上去？那就是要领下基督来。”他又说：“也不要说：谁要下到深渊去？那就是要把基督从无底坑里领上来。”那么，经上到底怎么说呢？

摩西怎么说？他说：“这道离你不远，就在你口里，也在你心里。”也就是说，我们所传信心的道：你若口里认耶稣为主，心里信神叫他从死里复活，就必得救。你听见了吗？你看，首先他说：“基督是律法的终结”，并不是句号。他说：“基督是律法的终结，为的是称义。”律法仍然在那里，为要讨神喜悦，为要改变你的生命，但它不再是你站在神面前、得着义与蒙悦纳的途径，我知道吗？为什么不再是？因为耶稣下到深渊里。耶稣踏上了寻求永生的征途。摩西说，保罗说，摩西说你不

不必上到天上去，不，因为耶稣已经从天降下。

保罗说，摩西说，你不必渡海去看，因为耶稣下到海的深处，担当了那些毁灭性的力量，承受了我们应得的毁灭。他把咒诅都归在自己身上，他被毁坏了。他踏上了一场伟大的远征，他走上了那条征途。他赢得了永生，如今把它当作礼物赐给我们。但我想让你知道一件事：耶稣基督的征途不同于世上曾经发生过的任何其他征途。

几年前我读过一篇学术文章，真是让我大开眼界，太惊人了。首先，那是一篇学术文章。作者是一位学者，他试图以更宏观的方式来研究并论述几乎所有不同文化中那些古老的神话性远古传说：无论是北欧的，还是地中海的，希腊罗马的，或是亚洲的。他们把这些故事、这些传奇都拿来比较，发现其中有一种共同的模式：有一些强壮的英雄人物，为了赢得某样东西而踏上征途。

这些传说全都是这样。所有的传奇都是这样：强健的英雄人物踏上征途去赢得某样东西。而那篇文章令人惊讶地说了这一点：上一代在全世界范围内最了解这些古代神话与传说、能读原文等等的那位学者——比当时任何活着的人都更懂它们——就是牛津教授 J.R.R. 托尔金。那篇文章又说，第二，他太喜欢这些故事了，以至于想写一个属于他自己的。他想写一个关于征途的神话故事，他也确实写了；但第三，他深受基督信仰、深受基督福音的浸润，以至于他的故事几乎成了所有其他神话性远古传说的反题。因为每一个其他古老的传说，都是一个强者出去拯救世界——靠赢得某样东西。但在托尔金的故事里，也在福音里，拯救世界的是一个软弱的人：他借着失去而得胜；他踏上征途不是为了得到什么，而是为了失去什么。

你看，在历史的核心，在 h

我们心里的核心，是一位受苦的仆人——他借着失去而得胜，坠入黑暗，使我们得以活在光明中。也正因如此，耶稣的“追寻”不同于其他文化里那些自救、自我称义的追寻。也正因如此，有一位基督徒诗人爱德华·希利托（Edward Shillito）在对耶稣说话时这样对他说：别的神都强壮，你却软弱；他们乘骑而来，你却踉跄着走向你的宝座。

但唯有神的伤口，才能对我们的伤口说话；没有哪一位神有伤口，惟有你。别的神都强壮，你却软弱；他们乘骑而来，你却踉跄着走向你的宝座。唯有神的伤口，才能对我们的伤口说话；在任何宗教里都没有一位神有伤口，惟有你。简单之处正是难处；让我这样结束。

如果你正在探索基督信仰，或者你可能已经——你知道，你也许是在教会里长大，如今正试着思考：我与基督信仰的关系到底是什么？请听我一句：你要明白，从某种意义上说，理解“简单的难处”，并在其难处中把握这份简单，就是你成为基督徒的方式。你想知道怎样成为基督徒吗？你想知道怎样与神进入立约的关系吗？就是这个。

你会说，这很矛盾。你什么意思？我给你一个最典型的案例研究。1740年代，有一群年轻人，其实都属于教会。事实上，我想其中有些人还是按立的牧师。

他们在英国国教会，在伦敦，但他们知道自己缺了些什么。他们知道自己没有与神的个人关系；没有与神的立约关系；没有一颗新心。他们开始在晚上聚会，彼此为对方朗读路德《加拉太书》序言——马丁·路德为《加拉太书》所写的序言。

在连续几天、约一周左右的夜晚里，循道宗（卫理公会）的创始人约翰·卫斯理（John Wesley）、伟大的圣诗作者查尔斯·卫斯理（Charles Wesley）——他的弟弟——以及许多朋友都信主归正了。当他们忽然明白了神恩典那份简单之时，事情就豁然开朗；这里有一个

……有一位你可能没听过的名叫威廉·霍兰德（William Holland）的人，但他的经历正好是一个绝佳的例子。这是他日记里的记载。查尔斯·卫斯理（Charles Wesley）先生朗读到路德说的那句话时：“那么，我们就什么都不用做了吗？”

不，什么都不用做。只要接受那位从神而来、为我们成为智慧、公义、圣洁、救赎的主。紧紧抓住这些话的时候，有一种能力临到我，我几乎无法想象末了会如何描述。我心里充满了平安与爱，以至于我放声痛哭；后来我走到街上，几乎感觉不到脚下所踏的地。

发生的事是：恩典的单纯击中了他。而就在那一刻——就在你愿意付代价的时候：除掉你的骄傲，从此再也不能看不起任何人；也除掉你对自己人生的控制，因为你如今知道你欠祂一切，一切都出于祂的怜悯。若你愿意付这些代价，而恩典的单纯在那一刻临到——就在那一刻你正在成为基督徒，就在那一刻你进入与神的个人关系。你会说：“那如果我已经信了呢？你对我还有最后一句话吗？”当然有。

你里面的生命——那生命。神就是你的生命。因着耶稣，祂如今是你的生命。这是有保证的；这生命在你里面。

所以在歌罗西书第3章，保罗说；在约翰一书第3章，也谈到我们的生命与神一同藏着。我们的生命在神里面。我们其实甚至不知道自己将来会成为什么样；等到末日耶稣基督显现时，我们知道自己要像祂。我的意思是，这简直不可思议。

在你里面开始的那生命，就像一片海洋；你现在不过是将来的影子。C.S.刘易斯描述了你将来要成为什么样的人：要带着这样的盼望活着。祂要把我们当中最软弱、最污秽的人，塑造成光彩夺目、荣耀灿烂、不朽的受造物，里面涌动着一种我们如今无法想象的能力、喜乐、智慧与爱。

祂能使我们都成为明亮、无瑕的镜子，虽在较小的尺度上，却完美地把祂那无边的能力、喜悦与良善反照给神。这就是我们将要进入的。没有什么

让我们祷告。谢谢你，天父。

谢谢你，天父。借着耶稣基督，你可以成为我们的生命。我们感谢你把这生命栽种在我们许多人里面。我们感谢这生命在我们思想未来时所带给我们的盼望。我们也感谢福音那艰难却朴素的简单。

我们祈求你保守我们，不让骄傲使我们偏离，不让自命不凡让我们对它视而不见，不让自满使我们不去认真推演福音对我们生命每一个领域所带来的激进含义。所以我们求你现在帮助我们，真的借着耶稣基督领受你的生命。我们选择它。奉耶稣的名求，阿们。

今天早上的经文取自《申命记》30章11-20节。“我今日所吩咐你的诫命，并不是你难行的，也不是离你远的；不是在天上，使你说：‘谁替我们上天取下来，使我们听见可以遵行呢？’也不是在海那边，使你说：‘谁替我们过海取了来，使我们听见可以遵行呢？’不。

这话却离你甚近，就在你口中，在你心里，使你可以遵行。看哪，我今日将生与福乐、死与祸患，陈明在你面前。

我今日吩咐你要爱耶和华——你的神，遵行他的道，谨守他的诫命、律例、典章，你就必存活，人数增多；耶和华——你的神，必在你所要进去得为业的地上赐福与你。倘若你心里偏离，不肯听从，却被勾引去敬拜别神，事奉它们，我今日明明告诉你们，你们必要灭亡；在你过约旦河进去得为业的地上，你的日子必不长久。我今日呼天唤地向你作证：我将生死、祸福、咒诅与祝福都摆在你面前；所以你要选择生命，使你和你的儿女都得以存活；且要爱耶和华——你的神，听从他的话，专靠他。

因为耶和华是你的生命；他也必使你在那地上年日长久，就是他向你列祖起誓要赐给他们的地

，亚伯拉罕、以撒和雅各。这是主的话。

我们一直在看《申命记》，我们说过，这是一系列讲道，是摩西在他生命的最后时刻对他的百姓所讲的。如今我们真的来到了这一系列的末尾，也来到了他最后一篇讲道的结尾。在第16节我们看到，就在最后的最后，他说他是在“吩咐”。“吩咐”这个词的意思是，他在呼召、在郑重嘱托他的百姓进入与上帝立约的关系。

所以要爱耶和华你们的上帝，行祂的道；过去几周我们一直在看这一点：与上帝立约的关系非常个人，却又具有约束力，并且会使整个人生被更新改变。而在这里的最后，摩西只是说：进入与上帝立约的关系。

这段经文最有意思的一点，就是它的简单、它的基础。太基础了，太直截了当了。选择。

这就是你能做的一件事：做这个，不做那个；这样会带来这个，那样会带来那个。

如此简单。事实上，简单到一个地步，我还为此挣扎过一点。我到现在仍然在这段经文上挣扎，你知道为什么吗？传道人喜欢把一段难的经文讲得简单。

然后大家就会说：“哦，比我想的简单多了。他真棒。他真是个很好的老师。”对吧？我其实相信，我今天的工作是：面对一段极其简单的经文，反而要让你看见它的难处。而我相信，这正是摩西想要让我们看见的。

摩西开始说：看，我把这种与上帝的个人关系摆在你面前。他其实在说：这并不太难。它离你很近。你不必上到天上去，你不必渡海到那边去。

他其实是在说：我告诉你的这种简单，本身就是它的难处。人之所以错过与上帝立约的关系，正是因为它太简单了。简单就是难处。若你要真正得到它，你就必须正视：与上帝建立个人关系这件事，那种“艰难的简单”。

现在，让我们从三个方面来看这“艰难的简单”。

在这里我们会看到，当谈到这种个人的立约关系时

与神同在，它那种具有欺骗性的平凡，它那带着威胁的恩慈，以及那难以想象的应许。它的欺骗性——抱歉——它的平凡。它那带着威胁的恩慈，而同时又有那难以想象的应许。所以首先，我们来看看它的平凡，我说这平凡是带着欺骗性的。第14节说，这话——这进入与神建立个人关系的吩咐——离你很近。

然后他说，这是什么意思呢？理解它的一种方式是看第12节。他说，它不在天上，以至于你需要说：谁替我们上到天上把它取下来，传给我们，使我们可以遵行它呢？古代文化里，所有古人都相信，神圣的智慧、神圣的知识、宇宙的奥秘、生命意义的奥秘、如何生活的奥秘、死后会发生什么的奥秘——宇宙的奥秘都是很难找到的东西，因为神或众神很遥远，他们把牌紧紧攥在胸前，不轻易示人。

古代传说里充满了这样的人：特别有天赋、格外纯洁的人，在肉身或灵里升到天上，他们得着异象，或有来自其他维度的访客，他们领受晦涩的神谕般言语，然后把只有他们才拥有的真理拼凑出来。而摩西对此一点也不买账。他说“你不必上到天上去得着这话”，他在说什么？结合整卷《申命记》，他的意思是：那位“诸天与天上的天尚且容不下”的神，已经降下来了。他已经下到西奈山。

摩西一再说，神亲自降下来，把这些事告诉你，并从火中对你说话，你记得吗？那么摩西在说什么？如果你想要宇宙的奥秘，你不必成为专家式的精英科学家；你也不必极其老练、成为艺术家或诗人；你不必只在阿斯彭某个排他性的静修营里才能得到。

你不必攀登高山去得着它，你知道为什么吗？它几乎就在每一家旅馆房间的抽屉里。它已经在《圣经》中启示出来，而《圣经》无处不在。它是最容易接触的书，是全世界最容易拿到手的文本、文字、印刷品。到处都是，

而且不仅如此，不仅你不必攀上天堂，不仅它已经直接降到这里，随处可得，而且宇宙的奥秘 literally 就在你鼻子底下——就在你眼皮底下。

你住一间汽车旅馆的房间也好，住一间酒店的房间也好，宇宙的奥秘就在那间房里，而你甚至不知道。它如此平常。但我想，摩西说“离你不远”，不仅是指在物理上触手可及——就在这里：我的话在这里，书在这里，就在这里——同时也是在理解上、理智上可及的。因为圣经里当然有许多难懂的地方，我们也很喜欢坐下来琢磨它们是什么；但圣经一再、一再地强调，它的核心教导却是极其容易明白的。事实上，让我给你一个《申命记》的摘要——它讲的就是神希望你如何生活，并且如何与祂建立关系。

摘要如下：第一，爱神，把祂的旨意放在你自己的意愿之前。第二，无私地爱邻舍，把他们的需要放在你自己的需要之前。换句话说，不要只顾自己第一位，而要把神和邻舍放在你之前。第三，你会发现因此你将得着更丰盛的生命，你的心也会更充实；若你紧抓着自己的心、紧抓着自己的生命，想靠自己把它填满，它本不会如此。

这太简单了，太容易明白了，就在那里。摩西说，你不必上天去找，就在那里；它很普通，人人都知道，它就在你周围。就在你酒店的房间里——宇宙的奥秘。那问题出在哪里？它具有迷惑性，而且它在两方面都具有迷惑性。事实上有两种方式——嗯，对世界上仅有的两种人来说，它都是迷惑人的。

首先，有些人不相信，或很难相信圣经的信仰；他们不喜欢，或者很难接受；他们心里有各种疑难。其中一个原因就是这种“具有迷惑性的简单”。不信的人常常会被它的简单所迷惑，为什么？因为你猜怎么着？现代人有着与古人完全一样的问题。

我们以为如果有某

如果有什么东西真的、真的很重要，有一些洞见真的很重要，那它就得是才华横溢、精致成熟、走在前沿、又新又潮、性感吸睛。让我告诉你，《圣经》一点也不是这些东西，但它总有些什么。不过我要说，对我来说，一个警示性的例子是两周前《纽约时报》9月9日的纽约市版上登的一篇文章。文章讲的是曼哈顿最后一家培训精神科医生做精神分析（弗洛伊德式精神分析）的机构。最后一家——培训治疗师做弗洛伊德式精神分析的机构——他们在讨论这件事，并提到就在30年前、40年前，曼哈顿还有几十家、几十家这样的机构。我之所以对此如此着迷，其中一个原因是我知道：我大约20年前来到这里时，跟当时五六十岁的纽约人聊天，他们告诉我，在世纪中叶，凡是在纽约算得上人物的、精明懂行的、跟得上时代的人，都会每周两三次去做分析，而且一做就是好多年、好多年、好多年。人人都知道：就是这个，这就是我们进入内心的方法，这就是关键，这就是一切；如果你不懂这个，你就落伍了。而现在它死了，它黯然失色；你知道，它一点也不性感。可你猜怎么着，福音却在每一个街角都在；但总会有别的东西要来了，对吧？

要当心圣经信仰那种具有欺骗性的简单。它确实会让那些在信不下去的人感到困惑；但你猜怎么着，我们这些相信的人也同样会被这信仰的简单所冲击。你看看它，那它的核心是什么呢？嗯，你知道，它的核心是——卡尔·巴特（Karl Barth）其实是这样说的：“耶稣爱我，我知道；因为圣经这样告诉我。”就是这样。或者换句话说：你得救是本乎上帝的恩典；而新约补充说，是借着基督的牺牲。你看着这些就说：好吧，我听过了，我听过了，我知道，我明白，我懂了，我懂了。它太简单了，以至于几乎没有人真正抓住它那彻底颠覆性的含义。沃尔特·布鲁格曼（Walter Brueggemann）写了一本关于《申命记》的注释，我

在这一系列讲道中，我一直在用一个例子：在这段经文里，他看到摩西所说的那句话——“这话离你并不远，反在你近旁”，你知道，它很简单，很容易明白，也触手可及。而布鲁格曼在他的注释书那一处讲了一个引人入胜的真实故事。他是这样说的：另一个说明上帝的话语何等朴素明白的例子，就是二战期间法国勒尚邦（Le Chambon）的福音派基督徒群体，在纳粹灭绝行动中把犹太人藏起来。

这个山村的居民，在福音派教会和牧师的带领下，在极其危险的处境中，拯救了估计三千到五千名犹太人的生命。以色列在1990年将整个村庄认定为“列国义人”，表彰他们非凡的怜悯与勇气。所以他们一定是特别勇敢、高尚又有洞见的人，对吗？战后，一位当年在那儿得以存活、已长大的犹太人回来，采访了曾保护他的人，想知道他们为何要为他冒如此大的风险；他试图弄明白，你知道，秘诀是什么。令他惊讶的是，一个又一个人都只是耸耸肩——真的就是耸耸肩——说这似乎是他们对耶稣的信仰所带来的一个显而易见的含义。

他们没有什么戏剧性的解释；他们的行动出自他们拥抱福音的最核心——耶稣舍己之爱的福音——这就够了。现在布鲁格曼在说的是——而这点很有力量——这个记载提出了一个问题。基督信仰的核心中心是什么？耶稣基督舍命、牺牲自己的生命，为要拯救、爱、并饶恕那些不信他、甚至拒绝他的人，对吗？所以，这个小山村里的一小群法国福音派信徒就说：既然耶稣为我们做了那样的事，我们当然至少也该冒着生命危险去救这些人，不管他们是否像我们一样相信。只是从基督信仰、基督信息的基础出发，一个合乎逻辑的推论，不是吗？

难道欧洲每个人都不知道基督教的基本信息吗？难道欧洲每个人没见过十字架吗？难道欧洲每个人都没见过……

欧洲，你知道，大家都知道这个基本的故事吗？那他们为什么不都那样做呢？答案是：对我们来说太简单了。

所以你觉得这太简单了，而它确实太简单；但它的含义又极其浩大。正因为我们一看就觉得“这很简单”，我们就不会把它的深远含义想透，对吧？亲爱的朋友们，不要被圣经在这个主题上所说之事的平常性所迷惑——没有与神建立个人的关系。如果你正在探索基督信仰，请不要因为它的简单与平常而觉得被冒犯。如果你是基督徒，却说：“哦，我明白福音了，我懂福音了”，那恰恰证明你并不懂。它的难，在于它的简单；它的简单，也在于它的难。

你只有真正抓住这一点，才算真的明白。其次，不过，这还不止这些，这只是这种“艰难的简单”中的一部分。第二点：这里有一种带着威胁的恩典。你看，我们说过，当摩西说“这离你不远”时，意思是你不必上天去把它取来，因为它已经在圣经里启示出来了。但现在还有另一个想法。

他说：“我今日所吩咐你的”（第11节）并不太难，也不超出你的能力，为什么？“也不在海那边，使你要说：谁替我们过海取来，使我们听见可以遵行呢？”现在，在古代世界，“海”的比喻有点不同。“海”是混乱与毁灭的象征。事实上，保罗——我们稍后会再回到这里——在《罗马书》10章引用了整段经文。

但他在《罗马书》10章引用这段话时，把“海”称为“深渊”。顺便说一句，关于海有几部不错的电影。有一部讲海的好电影就叫《深渊》。因为在古代，人们把海代表为死亡、毁灭。航海的人比在陆地上的人脆弱得多。

所以海象征着深渊和死亡。那摩西在这里说的是什么呢？他说，因为古人和古代传说里充满了那些英勇高贵、踏上征途的英雄人物；他们出海远行。那“征途”可能是为了很多事情。

其中一个著名的就是《杰森与阿尔戈英雄》。它被拍成了很多部既糟糕又精彩的电影。这是个很棒的故事：讲的是杰森出海去……

阿尔戈英雄的故事：杰森出航去寻找金羊毛，那金羊毛由一条龙看守，他最终得到了金羊毛。但一路上危机重重，有许多谜题需要他解开。

一路历经重重险阻，他回来后得着了王国。类似的故事多得惊人，几乎所有文化、所有古代文明，不管在哪里，都有这种强大的人物形象：他们踏上跨海的征途，为要赢得一个王国或永生。我最喜欢的一部把这些古老传说“好莱坞化”的版本——而且真的改得很好——就是《夺宝奇兵》第三部。你还记得吗？印第安纳·琼斯和他做考古学家的父亲在寻找圣杯。

他们相信如果找到圣杯并从中饮用，就能得到永生。他们遭遇各种危险，也有线索，就像所有其他古老的故事一样——电影制作人其实很懂这些古老、前神话式的历史。你还记得那些线索是什么吗？第一，“神的气息”，只有悔罪的人才能通过。看吧，每一个都让你想起某个特效场面。

第二，“神的道”，只有踏着神的脚步他才能前行。第三，“神的道路”，只有从狮子头上纵身一跃，他才算证明自己的价值。这些故事讲的都是同一件事：你想得救吗？你想得永生吗？

你想要那个国度吗？线索、伟业、远征、跨海；纵身一跃，证明你的价值——而摩西完全不吃这一套。相反，他说——有意思就在这里——他说，不在海那边。你不用渡海去把它拿回来，什么？

那它到底在哪里呢？他说，它在你的口里，也在你的心里。心是你信的地方，口是你承认的地方；他在说什么？他是在说：与上帝的这种关系不是你去成就的，而是你去领受的。不是你要证明自己配得，你只是得着它。

因此他在说：与上帝的这种关系，不是你要上天去拿的，也不是你要渡海去取的；你不必去进行某种远征，不必成为某个英勇的战士；你是借着恩典领受它。现在，这就带着威胁性，

这就是我们对它的第二个问题。如果你想要一个完美的例子，而且这是个很好的例子，那就是《列王纪下》第5章里关于乃缦的圣经故事。《列王纪下》第5章告诉我们，乃缦是亚兰（叙利亚）的将军，患了大麻风；他知道若不得医治就必死无疑。他听说以色列的上帝以及祂的大能，于是决定去以色列，寻找先知以利沙，求得医治与拯救。

经文告诉我们他是怎样动身去做这事的，而他随身带去的东西表明他明白自己是在踏上一场寻求之旅。他带着金子和珍宝，准备买下、购得一切所需；他带着刀剑，预备行一件大事，因为他是个有本事、有勇武的人；他还带着他王的推荐信等等。等他到了先知的家，以利沙甚至不出来；相反，以利沙的仆人告诉他：去约旦河里洗一洗。

乃缦就怒不可遏，气冲冲地跑开了；他的仆人追上去，对他说：主人，主人，若先知吩咐你去做一件大事，你难道不就去做了吗？这正是重点。他和所有人一样——所有古代人、所有现代人都一样——如果有救恩，我们就要靠自己去成就；我们得证明自己的价值；我们得从狮子头上跳过去；我们得拔出宝剑；我们得做一件大功。他原本期待以利沙出来说：把西方坏女巫的扫帚柄带来。

他本会觉得那样可以接受。他说，你看，他在表达的意思是：我是个勇武的人，我是个富有、资源充足的人。若你说：去把西方坏女巫的扫帚柄取来，去从龙那里夺回金羊毛；或者要我用我的巨额财富买来医治和拯救；又或者要我靠屠龙赢得它——那都不算侮辱。但任何傻子都能在约旦河里洗，任何孩子都能在约旦河里洗。那样的上帝把得救的门槛放得这么低。

你知道，凯西和我还记得，第一个我曾与之分享福音信仰的人，是在我们的人生

……在弗吉尼亚州霍普韦尔那个小镇里，我第一次去那里做牧师，那时我才 24 岁。那是一位很年轻、真的很受伤的年轻母亲，领着救济金的单亲妈妈。我把福音分享给她，她说：不可能这么简单。你知道，就是同一件事。那样的上帝，怎么会把得救的门槛定得这么低。

但答案是：一方面，我们有一位极其包容的上帝，你有恩典；那是一道任何人都能跨过去的门槛——任何凶手、任何破碎的人、任何人都能跨过去，因为那是恩典的门槛。但它其实并不低。它有要求；它要求你失去你的骄傲。来吧，乃缦，你说这对我来说太低了。不，你根本没有跨过去，不是吗？为什么不呢？

因为它对你来说太高了：因为这里有两样——这免费恩典、这份邀请的恩慈——它要求你放下两样东西。第一，你要放下你一生中都自以为有权看不起别人的那种心态。你必须放下你的骄傲。你必须永远放下。

你不再有权去看着别人说：你们不懂，你们这些乌合之众，你们这些想要干净的，你们这些蠢人。这个国家之所以变成这样，都是你们的错。祂永远拿走了那种想法、那种骄傲，因为你必须说：我不过是个罪人，我需要靠恩典得救。你还必须放下的第二样，是对自己人生的掌控。因为你看，如果你曾经披挂上阵、如果你是在一场伟大的征途中赢得了你的救恩——赢得了天国或永生——那么上帝就不能随便向你要任何东西；你有你的权利。你做了你该做的。

但如果你把一切、一切、一切都交给祂的怜悯，那么你就欠祂一切。你再也不能在自己的生命里发号施令了，你明白吗？这令人难以置信的包容性，同时又有这免费恩典那令人畏惧的代价性。它如此简单，如此容易，以至于我们反而接受不了，我们被它威胁到了。你看见了吗？你看，这又是这种极其艰难的简单的另一个方面。这种令人不安的恩慈，我们的骄傲——因为我们的骄傲，福音那完全的恩慈会把我们击倒——别让它把你击倒，但我们还没讲完。

这困难的简单的第一方面

……城里那种具有欺骗性的平常感。第二个方面是那种带着威胁的恩典，但第三个方面是那难以想象的应许。我是什么意思？你们都是聪明人，这是纽约，所以你读这段经文的时候会意识到：我一直在强调这段经文的第一部分，看起来全都是在讲恩典。你不必上到天上，你不必渡过大海，它就在你口里、在你心里；你要心里相信、口里承认，它就在那儿，就在那儿。但你读到最后一部分时，却好像第二部分完全推翻了刚才所说的话，因为它说：你看，如果你的心转离、不听从；如果你被引诱去向别神跪拜、去敬拜它们——我今日向你们宣告，你们必定灭亡。

你们在那地上必不得长久存活。我今日呼天唤地向你们作见证：我将生与死、福与祸陈明在你们面前；要拣选生命，不然这一切咒诅都要临到你们。等一下，我们会说，等一下，这听起来好像我们又回到了“追求”的那一套，我们又得再“渡海”了。

因为我们已经一路看过来，整卷《申命记》里，我们看见我们该做什么，看见我们该怎样生活，看见我们该怎样对待上帝，看见我们该怎样对待其他所有人——而我们永远不可能时时刻刻都活得出来。我们永远不可能时时刻刻都活得出来。

所以，这段经文的第二部分似乎提出了一个巨大的难题，似乎与第一部分相矛盾，但其实并不矛盾。因为有一个注脚：还有盼望。

你知道这盼望是什么吗？就在最后一节——几乎是摩西最后的一个词——他在那里说：“因为耶和华是你的生命。”让我告诉你那里发生了什么，让我告诉你那是多么惊人的应许：这是圣经里第一次出现这样的说法，我想在整个旧约里也是最后一次。

你看，到目前为止，“生命”——我们说的不是生物学意义上的生命，对吧？

“拣选生命。”不是生物学意义上的生命，那他们在说什么呢？

？那是属灵的生命，是永恒的生命，是新心等等。上周我们已经讲过这些。所以，要选择生命。

到目前为止，生命总是与顺服连在一起，死亡与悖逆连在一起。你若顺服，就得生命；换句话说，你的顺服就是你的生命。你若不顺服，就得死亡；换句话说，你的悖逆就是你的死亡。所以，选择生命，就是要顺服。到现在为止，整卷书一直在对你说的就是这个：你的顺服就是你的生命。

每次提到“生命”这个词，提到属灵生命这件事，都是说：你若顺服，就得生命；你的顺服就是你的生命；你的顺服就是你的生命。可是在第20节，突然，突然，摩西在这里基本上是在说：你的顺服本可以成为你的生命，也可以成为你的生命；但因为它不能成为你的生命——因为你不会一直守得住——所以，耶和华要成为你的生命。这是什么意思？不是说你若顺服，主就赐你生命。这里不是这个意思。

这里说：主将成为你的生命，主自己就是你的生命。这是什么意思？保罗在《罗马书》第10章里解释了。在《罗马书》第10章，保罗向《罗马书》的读者——罗马人——宣讲耶稣基督的福音时，正是来到这段经文。他引用的就是这段经文，并且以一种最不可思议的方式来解读它。

他是这么说的。这是《罗马书》第10章。保罗说：“基督是律法的总结”，使凡信的人都得着义。至于这从信而来的义，摩西曾说（引文）：“你不要心里说：谁要升到天上去呢？那就是要领下基督来。”他又说：“谁要下到阴间去呢？那就是要领基督从无底坑里上来。”那么，经上到底怎么说呢？

摩西怎么说？他说：“这道离你不远，就在你口里，也在你心里。”这就是我们所传信主的道：你若口里认耶稣为主，心里信神叫他从死里复活，就必得救。你听见了吗？你看，首先他说：基督是律法的终结——但不是句号。

他说，基督是律法为义的终结。

律法仍然在那里，为的是讨神喜悦、改变你的生命；但它不再是你站在神面前、被算为义并蒙接纳的途径。我不知道吗？为什么不？耶稣下到了深渊。耶稣踏上了寻求永生的征途。摩西说——保罗说——摩西说，你不必上到天上去，因为耶稣已经从天降下。

保罗说——摩西说，你也不必渡海去，因为耶稣进到了海的深处；他担当了那些毁灭性的力量，承受了我们该受的毁灭。他把咒诅都揽在自己身上，他被毁灭了。他踏上了一场伟大的征途，他去完成那场寻求。他赢得了永生，如今把它当作礼物赐给我们。但我希望你知道一件事：耶稣基督的征途与历史上任何一场征途都不同。

几年前我读到一篇学术文章，真是让我大开眼界，令人惊叹。首先，它是一篇学术文章。作者是一位学者，试图从很宏观的角度考察并论述几乎所有不同文化中那些古老的神话式史前传说——无论是北欧的，还是地中海的、希腊罗马的，或是亚洲的。他们把这些故事、这些传说都拿来比较，发现其中都有一种共同的模式。也就是：你会看到一些强大的英雄人物，踏上征途去赢得某样东西。

它们几乎全是这个主题。所有传说都是这样：强大的英雄人物踏上征途去赢得某样东西。然后这篇文章令人惊讶地说了这样一件事：上一代里，对这些古代神话与传说了解得最多、在全世界最权威的那位学者，熟知原文等等——上一代里比任何仍在世的人都更了解这些神话与传说的人——竟然是 J.R.R.

托尔金，一位牛津教授。文章又说，第二，他如此热爱这些神话，以至于想写一部属于自己的。他想写一个关于“征途”的神话故事，他也确实写了；但第三，他被基督信仰深深浸润，也被基督教福音深深浸润，以至于他的故事几乎成了所有其他神话式史前传说的反题——这些传说曾经发生过的一切的反面。

d. 因为几乎所有其他古代传说里，都是一个强者出征去拯救世界——靠赢得某样东西来完成拯救。但在托尔金那里、也在福音里，世界却是被一个软弱的人物所拯救：他借着“失去”而得胜；他踏上征途不是为了获得什么，而是为了失去什么。

你看，在历史的核心、也在我们自己生命的核心，是一位受苦的仆人：他藉着失去而得胜；他坠入黑暗，好叫我们能活在光中。这就是耶稣的征途之所以不同于各文化里那些自救、为自己称义的征途的原因。也正因如此，有一位基督徒诗人爱德华·奇拉托（Edward Chilato）在向耶稣说话时这样对他说：

“别的神都强壮，惟你却软弱。
他们骑乘而来，你却踉跄着走向你的宝座。

惟有神的伤，才能对我们的伤说话；
没有一位神有伤，唯独你。”

“别的神都强壮，惟你却软弱。
他们骑乘而来，你却踉跄着走向你的宝座。
你……我们的伤，惟有神的伤才能说话；
在任何宗教里都没有一位神有伤，唯独你。”

简单之处就是难处。让我这样结束。

如果你正在探索基督信仰；或者你也许已经——你知道，你可能是在教会里长大的——如今你在思考：我与基督信仰到底是什么关系？我告诉你一件事：请你明白，从某个意义上说，要理解“简单的难处”；并在一切难处中抓住这份简单——这就是你成为基督徒的方式。你想知道怎样成为基督徒吗？你想知道怎样与神进入盟约关系吗？就是这个。

你会说：“这不是自相矛盾吗？你什么意思？”让我给你一个非常典型的案例。1740年代，有一群年轻人，他们其实都属于教会。事实上，我想其中有些人还是按立的牧师。

他们在英格兰教会里，也在伦敦，但他们知道缺了点什么。他们知道自己没有与神的个人关系；没有与神的盟约关系；没有一颗新心。于是他们开始了一系列晚间聚会，彼此朗读路德《加拉太书》序言，M

马丁·路德为《加拉太书》写的序言。

在大约一周左右的时间里，连续好几个夜晚，卫斯理弟兄——卫理公会的创始人约翰·卫斯理、伟大的圣诗作者查尔斯·卫斯理（他的弟弟），以及他们一大群朋友——都信主归正了。当他们突然明白了上帝恩典何等简单的时候，下面这位你大概从未听过的人——威廉·霍兰（William Holland）——的经历，就是所发生之事的一个绝佳例子。这是他日记里的记录。

查尔斯·卫斯理先生大声朗读；读到路德说“那么，我们就什么都不用做了吗？”那一段时——

“不，不用做什么。只要接受那一位：他是上帝使之成为我们的——并且在我们里面、为我们成为——智慧、公义、圣洁、救赎。”

当我紧紧抓住这些话时，有一种能力临到我，强烈到我几乎无法想象自己结局会如何被描述。我心里充满了平安与爱，以至于我放声痛哭；后来我走到街上去。我几乎感觉不到自己脚下所踏的地。

发生了什么？就是：恩典的简单直击了他。而那一刻——当这件事发生、当你也愿意付上代价：放下你的骄傲，从此以后再也不能看不起任何人；放下你对人生的掌控，因为你现在知道你欠祂一切——一切都因祂的怜悯。你若愿意付上这些代价，而恩典的简单就在那一刻临到你——那一刻你就正在成为基督徒，那一刻你就进入了与上帝的个人关系。

你会说：“那如果我已经相信了呢？你对我还有最后一句话吗？”当然有。

这生命——在你里面的生命。上帝就是你的生命。因着耶稣，祂如今是你的生命。这是保证的。祂在你里面。

所以《歌罗西书》第3章，保罗说；《约翰一书》第3章也说：我们的生命与基督一同藏在上帝里面。我们的生命在上帝里面。我们甚至并不知道自己将来会成为什么样子；但当耶稣基督在末日显现时，我们知道我们要像祂。我的意思是，这简直超乎想象。

你里面开始的那生命，不过像是一粒种子；你现在不过是将来自己的影子。C.S.路易斯也描绘了你将来会成为什么样子。要活在这样的盼望里：祂要使那最软弱、最污秽的……

他能把我们每一个人都变成令人目眩、光辉灿烂、永不朽坏的受造物，里面涌动着一种我们如今无法想象的能力、喜乐、智慧与爱。

他能使我们都成为明亮、无瑕的镜子，虽在较小的尺度上，却能完美地把他自己那无边的能力、喜悦与良善反照归给神。这就是我们将要进入的结局。绝不止于此。我们祷告。

谢谢你，父。

谢谢你，父。借着耶稣基督，你可以成为我们的生命。我们为你在我们许多人里面所栽种的生命向你感谢。我们为这生命在我们思想未来时所带来的盼望向你感谢。我们也为福音那艰难的简单向你感谢。

我们祈求你保守我们，不让我们的骄傲使我们偏离，不让我们的势利轻看它，不让我们的自满拦阻我们在生命的每一个领域活出福音那彻底的含义。因此，我们求你现在帮助我们，真的借着耶稣基督领受你的生命。我们选择它。奉耶稣的名求，阿们。

### 引言：信仰的开放性

当谈到公开你的信仰时，你有多自在？本月的播客中，Tim Keller 探讨了圣经对公开信仰的看法。他向我们展示了在多元化社会中，以一种创造文明、和平和与邻居有意义对话的方式公开我们的信仰是什么样的。

早上好。今天早上的经文取自《申命记》第30章第11-20节。

> “我今日所吩咐你的诫命不是你难以遵守的，也不是离你很远的。不是在天上，使你说，谁为我们上天取下来，使我们听见可以遵行呢？也不是在海外，使你说，谁为我们过海取来，使我们听见可以遵行呢？这话却离你甚近，就在你口中，在你心里，使你可以遵行。看哪，我今日将生与福，死与祸，陈明在你面前。吩咐你爱耶和华你的神，遵行他的道，谨守他的诫命、律例、典章，使你可以存活，人数增多，耶和华你神就必在你所要进去得为业的地上赐福与你。倘若你心里偏离不肯听从，却被勾引去敬拜事奉别神，我今日明明告诉你们，你们必要灭亡，在你过约旦河进去得为业的地上，日子必不长久。我今日呼天唤地向你作见证，我将生死、祸福陈明在你面前，所以你要拣选生命，使你和你的后裔都得存活，并且爱耶和华你的神，听从他的话，专靠他，因为他是你的生命，你的日子长久也在乎他。这样，你就可以在耶和华向你列祖亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各起誓应许赐给他们的地上居住。”

这是主的话。

### 约的简单性

我们一直在研究《申命记》，我们说这是摩西在他生命的最后对他的百姓所讲的一系列讲道，现在我们真的到了系列的结尾，也到了他最后一篇讲道的结尾。在第16节，我们看到在最后，他说，他命令，这个词命令意味着他在呼召或委托他的百姓与神建立约的关系。

**所以，主，你是神，行在他的道中，过去几周我们一直在看这个，与神的约关系是非常个人化的，但又是约束性的，并且是全生命转变的。** 在最后，摩西只是说，与神建立那种约的关系。

现在，这段经文最有趣的事情之一就是它的简单性和基本性。它是如此基本，如此直接。选择。这是你可以做的一件事。做这个。不要做这个。这会带来这个。那会带来那个。如此简单。

### 迷惑的平凡性

#### 1. 简单性作为挑战

事实上，它是如此简单。我实际上有点挣扎。我仍然在这段经文上挣扎，你知道为什么吗？传道人喜欢把一段难懂的经文变得简单。然后每个人都说，哦，比我想象的简单。他真棒。他是个很棒的老师，好吧。我实际上相信我的工作是今天把一段极其简单的经文展示出它的难度。我相信这就是摩西想要告诉我们的。

摩西开始说，看，我在向你提供这种与神的个人关系。他实际上在说，这并不难。它就在你身边。你不必上天。你不必越过海洋。他实际上在说，我告诉你的简单性就是它的难度。人们错过了与神的约关系，因为它太简单了。**简单性就是它的难度。**

#### 2. 神话语的可及性

第14节说，这个词，这个进入与神个人关系的命令就在你身边。然后他说，这是什么意思？

好吧，理解这一点的方法之一是第12节。他说，这不是在天上，以至于你必须说，谁会上天去取下来并向我们宣告，以便我们可以遵行。

现在，古代文化，所有古代人民都相信神圣的智慧，神圣的知识，宇宙的秘密，生命意义的秘密，如何生活的秘密，死后会发生什么的秘密。宇宙的秘密是难以找到的东西，因为神或众神是遥远的，他们把牌藏在胸前。

古代传说充满了特别有天赋的纯洁的人，他们在身体或精神上升到天堂，他们有异象，或者他们有来自其他维度的访客，他们得到隐晦的神谕言辞，他们拼凑出只有他们拥有的真理。而摩西对此毫不接受。

当他说，你不必上天去得到这个时，他在说什么？他说，因为神，整本《申命记》都在说，天和最高的天都无法容纳的神，已经降临。他降临在西奈山。摩西一再说，神亲自降临并告诉你这些事情，并从火中对你说话，记得吗？

那么摩西在说什么？如果你想要宇宙的秘密，你不必是一个专家精英科学家。你也不必是一个非常复杂的艺术家诗人。你不只是在阿斯彭的一个独家静修会上得到它。你不必爬山去得到它，你知道为什么吗？它几乎在每个酒店房间的抽屉里。它在圣经中揭示，圣经无处不在。它是最容易获得的书籍，是世界上最容易获得的文本，书面东西和印刷品。

### 威胁的恩典

#### 1. 恩典的简单性

现在，你看，我们说，当摩西说，这在你身边，意思是你不必上天去得到它，因为它在圣经中揭示。但现在这里有另一个想法。他说，我今天所吩咐你的，11节，并不难以遵守，也不超出你的能力，为什么？它不在海洋之外，以至于你必须问，谁将越过海洋去得到它？

现在，海洋在古代世界中是一个有点不同的隐喻。海洋是混乱和毁灭的象征。事实上，保罗，我们会回到这一点，保罗在《罗马书》第10章中引用了这整段经文。但当他在《罗马书》第10章中引用这段经文时，他称海洋为深渊。当然，还有几部好电影，顺便说一下。有一部关于海洋的好电影叫《深渊》。因为在古代，海洋代表死亡，毁灭。航海者比陆地上的人更脆弱。因此，海洋代表深渊和死亡。

#### 2. 拿阿曼的故事

如果你想要一个完美的例子，这是一个很好的例子，是《列王纪下》第5章中拿阿曼的圣经故事。在《列王纪下》第5章中，我们被告知拿阿曼是一个叙利亚将军，他患了麻风病，他知道如果不治愈他就会死，他听说了以色列的神和他的力量。所以他决定去以色列，找到先知以利沙，寻求他的医治和拯救。

文本告诉我们他如何出发，以及他带来的东西显示他理解自己在进行一场探险。他带着金子和宝藏去购买他必须购买的任何东西。他带着剑，准备做一件伟大的事，因为他是一个有勇气和英勇的人。他带着国王的推荐信，等等，他到达先知的房子，以利沙甚至没有出来。相反，他被以利沙的仆人告知，去约旦河洗澡。

拿阿曼愤怒地跑开了，他的仆人追上他，他们说，主人，主人，如果先知告诉你做一件伟大的事，你难道不会去做吗？这就是重点。他就像所有人，所有古代人，所有现代人。如果有拯救，我们将实现它，我们必须证明我们的价值，我们必须从狮子的头上跳跃，我们必须拔出剑，我们必须做一些伟大的事。

### 不可思议的应许

#### 1. 生命的应许

我的意思是什么？你们是聪明人，这是纽约，所以如果你在读那段经文，你会意识到我一直在集中在经文的第一部分，这似乎全是关于恩典的。你不必上天，你不必越过海洋，它就在你的口中和心里，你必须在心里相信并用口承认，它在那里，它就在那儿，但然后你到达最后一部分，似乎第二部分完全与刚才所说的相矛盾，因为它说，你看，如果你的心偏离而你不顺服，如果你被引诱去敬拜其他神，我今日明明告诉你，你必定被毁灭。

#### 2. 耶稣的角色

保罗在《罗马书》第10章中解释了这一点。在《罗马书》第10章中，保罗在向《罗马书》的读者宣讲耶稣基督的福音时，来到这段经文。他来到这段经文，并以最不可思议的方式解释了这段经文。这是他说的。这是《罗马书》第10章。基督是律法的终结，保罗说，作为每个相信者的义的手段。

> “现在关于通过信仰而来的义，摩西说，引用，不要在心里说，谁将升到天上，因为那将把基督带下来。他说，不要说谁将降到深渊，因为那将把基督带上来，但它说什么？摩西说，话语就在你身边，在你的口中和心里，那就是我们所宣讲的信心的话语，如果你用口承认耶稣是主，并在心里相信神使他从死里复活，你就必得救。”

你听到了吗？看，首先，他说，基督是律法的终结，不是句号。他说，基督是义的律法的终结。它仍然存在以取悦神，改变你的生活，但不再是站在神面前的手段，义和接受，不是吗？为什么不呢？耶稣进入了深渊。耶稣为了永生而进行了探险。

### 结论

如果你正在探索基督教，或者如果你可能已经来到，你知道，你可能是在教会中长大的，现在你正在思考，好吧，我与基督教的关系是什么？告诉我的话，请意识到，在某些方面，理解简单性的难度，并在其所有难度中掌握简单性是你成为基督徒的方式。你想知道如何成为基督徒吗？你想知道如何与神建立约的关系吗？就是这样。

**你说，那是矛盾的。你是什么意思？给我一个完美的案例研究。**

在1740年代，有一群年轻人，他们实际上都是教会的一部分。事实上，我认为他们中的一些人是被任命的牧师。他们在伦敦的英格兰教会，但他们知道有些东西缺失了。他们知道他们没有与神的个人关系。他们没有与神的约关系。他们没有

新的心。他们开始举行一系列晚间聚会，在聚会上彼此朗读马丁·路德《加拉太书》序言。大约一周之内，约翰·卫斯理——循道宗（卫理公会）运动的创始人——查尔斯·卫斯理（伟大的圣诗作者、他的兄弟），以及他们的许多朋友都归信了。

当“恩典的简单”真正落在一个人身上时，会发生什么？这里有一个你可能没听过的人——威廉·霍兰德——这是个完美的例子。以下摘自他的日记：

> “查尔斯·卫斯理先生大声朗读，读到路德说：我们需要做什么吗？不，什么也不需要。只要接受祂——神为我们所成就的一切：祂成了我们的智慧、公义、圣洁和救赎。听见这些话时，有一种能力临到我身上，我几乎无法想象，更难以描述。我的心充满了平安与爱，以至于我流下眼泪；后来我走到街上，几乎感觉不到自己脚下所踏的地面。”

当时发生的，就是“恩典的简单”击中了他。那一刻之所以发生，是因为他愿意付代价：放下骄傲，说“从今以后，我再也不能轻看任何人”；也放弃对自己人生的控制，因为你如今知道你欠祂一切，一切都完全系于祂的怜悯。若你愿意付这样的代价，“恩典的简单”就在那一刻发生——你就在那一刻成为基督徒，就在那一刻进入与神的个人关系。

你说：“好吧，如果我已经信了呢？你还有最后的话要对我说吗？”当然有。生命——生命在你里面。神就是你的生命。因着耶稣，如今祂就是你的生命。这是确定无疑的：祂在你里面。这也是保罗在《歌罗西书》第三章以及《约翰一书》第三章所说的——我们的生命与基督一同藏在神里面。我们的生命在神里面。我们真不知道将来会成为什么；但当耶稣基督在末日显现时，我们知道自己将要像祂。我是说，这超出人的想象。如今在你里面开始的生命，只是一粒种子；你现在不过是你将来所成为之人的影子。

**看看路易斯如何描述你将要成为的样子。要活在这样的盼望里：祂将把我们中最软弱、最污秽的人，变成耀眼的不朽生命，充满我们如今无法想象的能量、喜乐、智慧与爱。祂能使我们所有人成为明亮、无瑕的镜子——虽在较小的尺度上，却能完美地把神那无边的能力、喜乐与良善反射出来。这就是我们所期待的；没有别的。**

我们一起祷告。

父啊，谢谢你。父啊，谢谢你。藉着耶稣基督，你可以成为我们的生命。我们感谢你在我们许多人里面种下生命；我们感谢你赐给我们的盼望，使我们思想自己的将来；我们感谢你福音那“艰难的简单”。我们求你：不要让我们因骄傲而被拒绝在恩典之外，不要让我们因自负而忽视它，也不要让我们因自满而拦阻福音在我们生命每个领域里产生那激进、彻底的影响。

因此我们求你，现在就帮助我们，藉着耶稣基督真实地领受你的生命。我们选择它。奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。
