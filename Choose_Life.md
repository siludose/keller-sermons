## English Transcript / 英文原文

The scripture this morning is taken from the Book of Deuteronomy, chapter 30, verses 11-20. Now, what's I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach. It is not up in heaven so that you have to ask who will ascend to heaven to get it  and proclaim it to us so we may obey it. Nor is it beyond the sea so that you have to ask who will cross the sea to get it and  proclaim it to us so we may obey it. No.

The Word is very near you. It is in your mouth and in your heart. No. You may obey it. See I have set before you today life in prosperity, death and destruction.

For I command you today to love the Lord, your God, to walk in His ways and to keep His  commands, decrees, and laws, then you will live and increase. And the Lord, your God, will bless you in the land you are entering to possess. But if your heart turns away and you are not obedient, and if you are drawn away to bow  down to other gods and worship them, then I declare to you this day that you will certainly  be destroyed. You will not live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess. This day I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you, that I have set before you life  and death blessings and curses, now choose life so that you and your children may live and  that you may love the Lord, your God, listen to His voice and hold fast to Him.

So the Lord is your life, and He will give you many years. In the land He swore to give to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. This is the Word of the Lord. We've been looking at the book of Deuteronomy and we've said that this is a series of sermons  that Moses preached to his people right at the very end of his life, and now we really  truly are at the end of the series, and we're at the end of the last of his sermons. And in verse 16, we see that at the very, very end, he says, he's commanding, that word  command means he's calling or charging his people to enter into a covenant relationship  with God.

So the Lord, you are God and walk in His ways, and for the last couple of weeks been looking  at this, a covenant relationship with God is very personal yet binding and whole life  transforming. And here at the very end, Moses is simply saying, enter that covenant relationship with God. Now one of the most interesting things about this passage is its simplicity and its basicness. It's so basic, so straightforward. Choose.

Here's the one thing you can do. Do this. Don't do this. This will bring this. This will bring this.

So simple. In fact, it's so simple. I actually struggled a little bit with this. I still struggle with this passage, you know why? A preacher loves to take a hard passage and make it simple.

And everybody say, oh, it's simpler than I thought. He's wonderful. He says a wonderful teacher, okay. I actually believe that my job is to take an extremely simple passage today and actually  show you its difficulty. And I believe that's what Moses is trying to show us.

Moses starts saying, look, I'm offering you this personal relationship with God. And he's actually saying, it's not too difficult. It's near you. You don't have to go up to heaven. You don't have to go over the sea.

He's actually trying to say the simplicity of what I'm telling you is its difficulty. People miss this covenant relationship with God because it's so simple. The simplicity is its difficulty. And if you're ever going to get it, you need to come to grips with the difficult simplicity  of having a personal relationship with God. Now, let's look at this difficult simplicity under three headings.

We're going to see here, when it comes to this personal covenant relationship with God,  its deceptive ordinariness, its threatening graciousness, and its unimaginable promise. Its deceptiveness, its deceptive pardon me, ordinariness. Its threatening graciousness, and yet its unimaginable promise. So first, let's look at its ordinariness, which I said is deceptive. Verse 14 says, this word, this charge to enter into a personal relationship with God is near  you.

And then he says, what does that mean? Well, one of the ways to understand that is verse 12. He says, it is not up in heaven so that you have to say, who will ascend into heaven  and get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it. Now ancient cultures, all ancient peoples believe that divine wisdom, divine knowledge, secrets  of the universe, secrets of the meaning of life, secrets for how to live, secrets of  what happens after death. The secrets of the universe are hard to find things, because God or the gods are remote  and they hold their cards to their chests.

The ancient legends are filled with particularly gifted pure people who in body or spirit ascend  to the heavens, and they have visions, or they have visitors from other dimensions, and  they get cryptic oracular utterances and they piece together the truth that only they have. And Moses will have none of it. When he says, you don't have to go up to heaven to get this, what is he saying? He says because the God, with the whole book of Deuteronomy, says the God whom heaven and  highest heaven cannot even contain, has come down. He's come on down into Mount Sinai.

Over and over again, Moses says, God himself came down and told you these things and spoke  to you out of the fire, remember that? So what is Moses saying? If you want the secrets of the universe, you don't have to be an expert elite scientist. Nor do you have to be incredibly sophisticated, artiste poet. You don't only get it at an exclusive retreat in Aspen.

You don't have to climb a mountain to get it, you know why? It's in virtually every hotel room drawer. It's revealed in the Bible and the Bible is everywhere. It's the most accessible book, it's the most easy to get a hold of text, written thing  and print in the whole world. It's all over the place and not only, not only don't you have to climb up to heaven, not  only has it just come right down here and it's available everywhere and it's literally  right under your nose is the secret of the universe, it's under your noses.

You take a motel room, you take a hotel room, the secrets of the universe are in that hotel  room and you didn't even know it. It's so ordinary. But not only I think as Moses when he says it's near you means it's physically accessible. Here it is and my words, here it is and the book, here it is, but it's also intellectually  accessible because of course there's many things in the Bible that are difficult to understand  and we love to sit and figure out what they are but the things in the Bible says over  and over and over again, the court teachings of the Bible are unbelievably accessible. In fact let me give you a summary of the book of Deuteronomy which is all about how God wants  you to live and relate to him.

Here's a summary. Number one, love God and put his will ahead of your own. Two, love your neighbors unsilfcially and put their needs ahead of your own. In other words don't look out for number one but put God in your neighbor's first and  number three, you will find as a result. You will have so much of a richer life and a heart so much more full than it would  have been if you had held onto your heart and held onto your life and tried to fill it  yourself.

It's so simple, it's accessible, it's right there. Moses says you don't have to go up to heaven, it's right there, it's ordinary, everybody  knows it's all around you. It's in your hotel room, the secrets of the universe, now what's the problem? It's deceptive and it's deceptive in two ways. There are two ways, in fact, well for the only two kinds of people in the world it's deceptive.

First of all, there's people who don't believe or have trouble believing biblical faith,  they don't like it or they have trouble with it, they've got difficulties. One of the reasons is the deceptive simplicity. People who don't believe it very often are deceived by the simplicity, why? Well, guess what? Modern people have every bit the same problem that the ancients had.

We think if something's really, really important, some insights really important, it's got  to be brilliant and sophisticated and cutting edge, and new and sexy. Let me tell you, the Bible is not any of those things, but there's always something, but  boy I'll tell you, cautionary tale for me has been in September 9th, New York Times  city section just two weeks ago. There was an article about the last institute in Manhattan that trains psychiatrists in  psychoanalysis, Freudian psychoanalysis. The last institute, the trains, therapists in Freudian psychoanalysis, they were talking  about it, and they've mentioned that even just say 30 years ago, 40 years ago there  were dozens and dozens in Manhattan. One of the reasons I was so intrigued by that was because I know, when I got here like  20 years ago, and I would talk to New Yorkers who at the time were saying their 50s or 60s,  what they told me was that in the middle of the century, every New Yorker who was anybody,  anyone who was savvy, anyone who was with at all went to analysis two or three times a  week for years and years and years, and everybody knew this is it, this is how we're going  to get into our hearts, this is the whole issue, this is it, and if you don't understand  this, you're just out of it, and now it's dead, it's an eclipse, it is, you know, it  is so unsexy, and yet guess what, the gospel's on every street corner, but there's something  else coming, right?

Beware the deceptive simplicity of biblical faith. It really throws people who are having trouble believing it, but guess what, the simplicity  of our faith throws just as much those of us who do believe it. You look at it, well what is the heart of it? Well, you know, the heart of it is, you know, Carl Bart actually said it this way, Jesus  loves me this I know, for the Bible tells me so, there it is, or put it another way is  you're saved by God's grace, and the New Testament adds through the sacrifice of Christ, and  you look at that and you say, okay, I've heard that, I've heard that, I know it, I got it,  I got it, and it's so simple, almost nobody grasped the radical implications of it. Walter Brogiman wrote a commentary on Deuteronomy that I use, I've been using during this series  of sermons, and in what, on this passage where he sees the place where Moses says, this  word is not beyond you, it's near you, you know, it's simple, it's accessible, and  Brogiman, and that place in his commentary tells this fascinating story, true story, and  here's what he says, another illustration of how plain and simple God's word is, is  the account of the evangelical Christian community of Le Chambon in France during World War  2, that hid Jews during Nazi efforts at extermination.

The people of the mountain village, under the direction of evangelical church and pastor,  saved the lives of an estimated three to 5,000 Jews under circumstances extremely dangerous. The state of Israel 1990 recognized the entire village as righteous among the nations for  their remarkable compassion and bravery. So they must have been unusually courageous and noble and insightful, no? After the war, a Jewish adult who was kept alive there as a child returned and interviewed  his protectors about their reasons for taking such risky actions on his behalf, he was  trying to figure out, you know, what was the secret? To his surprise, one after the other all merely shrugged their shoulders, literally, and  said it seemed to be an obvious implication of their faith in Jesus.

They had no dramatic explanations, their actions stem from the very center of their embrace  of the gospel of the sacrificial love of Jesus, and it was enough. Now what Bergman's saying, and it's a powerful point, this account begs a question. The center of the core of the Christian faith, Jesus Christ gave his life, sacrifice his  life, to save, love, and forgive people who didn't believe in him, who were rejecting  him, right? So this little group of French evangelicals in this little mountain village said, well,  if Jesus did that for us, surely we should at least risk our lives to save these people  whether they believe like we do or not. Just a logical implication of what, of the basic Christian faith, the basic Christian  message, right?

Didn't everybody in Europe know the basic Christian message? Hasn't everybody in Europe seen crucifix? Hasn't everybody in Europe, you know, known the basic story? And why didn't they all do that? And the answer is, it's too simple for us.

So you think it's so simple, and it is so simple, but the implications are so vast,  and because we look and so, it's simple, we don't think out the implications, right? Dear friends, do not be deceived by the ordinaryness of what the Bible says about this subject,  not have a personal relationship with God. If you're exploring Christianity, please don't be offended by simplicity and its ordinaryness. And if you're a Christian and you say, oh, I understand the gospel, I get the gospel,  that just proves you don't. It's difficulty, it's simplicity, it's simplicity, it's difficulty.

And you really don't understand it until you really grasp that. Secondly, though, that's not all, that's part of this difficult simplicity. Secondly, there's a threatening graciousness to this. Now, you see, we said, when Moses says, this is near you, in the sense of you don't have  to go to heaven to get it, because it's revealed in the Bible. But now here's another thought.

He says, what I am commanding you today, verse 11, is not too difficult for you,  or beyond your reach, why? It is not beyond the sea so that you have to ask, who shall cross the sea to get it? Now, the sea is a little different metaphor in the ancient world. The sea was the symbol of chaos and destruction. In fact, Paul, we're going to get back to this, Paul quotes this whole passage in Romans 10.

But when he quotes the passage in Romans 10, he calls the sea the abyss. And of course, there's a couple of good movies, by the way. There's a good movie about the sea called the abyss. Because in ancient times, the sea was represented death, destruction. Sea fairers were far more vulnerable than people who were on land.

And so the sea represented the abyss and death. Now, what is Moses talking about here? He says, because ancient people and the ancient legends are filled with heroic noble figures  on a quest. And they go out on the sea. And the quest can be a number of things.

One of the great ones is Jason and the Argonauts. It's made in many bad, great movies. Just a great story about Jason goes off of the Argonauts and he's looking for a golden  fleece that is guarded by a dragon and he gets the golden fleece. But there's many perils. There's many riddles that he has to solve.

And many perils and he comes back and he gains the kingdom. And there are just an enormous number of these. It's almost all the cultures, all the ancient cultures, no matter where they have these strong  figures who go on these quests over the sea to gain a kingdom or eternal life. My favorite Hollywoodized version of all those ancient legends, and it's a really good  Hollywoodized version, is the third of the Indiana Jones movies. You remember where Indiana Jones and his archeologist father are after the holy grail.

And they believe that if they get the holy grail and you drink from it, you'll get eternal  life. And they have perils and there are clues just like all the other ancient, the movie makers  just understood all the other ancient pre-mythic histories. You remember what the clues were? First, the breath of God, only the penitent man will pass. See, every one of these reminds you of another special effect.

The word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth. And that's what all these stories are about. You want salvation? See, you want eternal life?

You want the kingdom? Clues, greatness, quest, over the sea. The leap, prove your worth, and Moses will have none of it. Instead he says, and this is what's so interesting, he says, it's not over the sea. You don't go over the sea to get it, what?

Then what is it? He says, it's in your mouth and in your heart. So your heart is where you believe, your mouth is what you confess, and what is he saying? He says, this relationship with God is not something you achieve, it's something you receive. It's not something that you prove your worth, you just get it.

And therefore he's talking, he's saying, that this relationship with God is not something  that you go to heaven to get, you go over the sea to get, you don't go on some kind of  quest, you don't have to be some heroic warrior, you receive it by grace. Now this is threatening, and this is our second problem we have with it. If you want a perfect example of this, and it's a great example, is the biblical story  of Naaman in 2 Kings chapter 5. In 2 Kings chapter 5 we're told about Naaman who was a Syrian general, and he was stricken  with leprosy, and he knew he was going to die if he wasn't healed, and he heard about  the God of Israel and his power. So he decided to go to Israel and find the prophet Elisha and seek his healing and salvation.

And the text tells us the way he's salad forth to do so, and what he brought with him  showed that he understood himself being on a quest. He went with gold and treasure to buy whatever and purchase whatever he had to. He went with a sword, ready to do a great deed because he was a man of prowess and valor. He went with letters of recommendation from his king, and so on, and he gets to the  prophet's house, and Elisha doesn't even come out. Instead he's told by the valet of Elisha, go wash in the Jordan River.

And a Naaman is furious, and he runs away in fury, and his servants go after them, and  they say, master, master, if you were told by the prophet to do some great deed, wouldn't  you have done it? And that's the point. He's like all people, all ancient people, all modern people. If there's salvation, we're going to achieve it, we have to prove our worth, we have to  leap from the lion's head, we have to bring out our sword, we have to do some great deed. He was expecting Elisha to come out and say, bring me the broomstick of the wicked witch  of the west.

And he would have been, he says, you see, here's what he's saying. He says, I'm a man of valor, I'm a man of wealth and means hard one. And it wouldn't be insulting to say, go get the broomstick of the wicked witch of the  west, get the golden fleece from the dragon, it wouldn't be wrong if you asked me to purchase  with my great wealth, my healing and my salvation, or to win it by slaying a dragon. But any idiot can wash in the Jordan River, any child can wash in the Jordan River. That kind of God has a bar of salvation so low.

You know, Kathy and I remember, the one was the first person I ever shared the gospel  faith with in our little town in Hope, Well, Virginia, where I first went as a 24-year-old  pastor. And it was a young, really hurting young mother on welfare, single mother. And I shared the gospel and she said, it can't be that easy. You know, same thing. That kind of God would have the bar of salvation so low.

But the answer is, on the one hand, we have a God so incredibly inclusive that you've  got grace, and that's a bar that anyone can step over, any murderer, any broken person,  anyone can step over the bar because it's a bar of grace, but it's actually not low. Demands and it requires that you lose your pride. Come on, Naaman, you say this is too low for me. No, you're not stepping over it, are you? Why not?

It's too high for you because there's two things that they offer a free grace, the graciousness  of this offer. There's two things that it demands you to give up. One is, you're right to look down on anybody else the rest of your life. You have to give up your pride. You have to give up forever.

You're right to look at anyone else and say, you don't understand, you rabble, you want  clean, you fools. You're the reason that things are the way they are in this country. He takes away forever the idea, the pride because you have to say, I'm just a sinner, I need  to be saved by grace. The other thing you have to give up is control of your life because you see if you had  salad forth, and if you had won your salvation with the kingdom or eternal life on a great  quest, then God couldn't just ask anything of you, you have your rights. You've done what you should be doing.

But if you out everything, everything, everything to His mercy, you owe Him everything. You can't call the shots in your life anymore, don't you see? The incredible inclusiveness at the same time, the threatening costliness of the free grace  of God, it is so simple, it is so easy that we can't take it, we're threatened by it. You see how this, see here's another aspect of this incredibly difficult simplicity. This threatening graciousness, our pride, because of our pride, the absolute graciousness  of the gospel throws us, don't let it throw you, but we're not done.

First aspect of this difficult simplicity is the deceptive ordinariness. The second aspect is the threatening graciousness, but the third aspect is the unimaginable  promise. What do I mean by that? You're smart people, this is New York, so if you're reading that passage, you realize  that I've been concentrating on the first part of the passage, which seems to be all about  grace. You don't have to go to heaven, you don't have to go over the sea, it's right there in  your mouth in your heart, you have to believe in your heart and confess with your mouth,  and it's there, it's right there, but then you get to the last part, and it seems like  the second part totally contradicts what was just said, because it says, you see, if your  heart turns away and you're not obedient, and if you're drawn away to bow down to other  gods and worship them, I declare to you this day you will certainly be destroyed.

You will not live long in the land. This day I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you that I have set before you life  and death, blessings and curses, choose life, or else all these curses will come upon  you. And wait a minute, we say, wait a minute, that seems like we're back to the quest thing,  we're back to going over the sea again. Because we've been through this, all the book of Deuteronomy, we see what we're supposed  to do, we see how we're supposed to live, we see how we're supposed to cheat God, we see  how we're supposed to treat everyone else, and we'll never live up to that all the time. We'll never live up to that all the time.

So it almost seems like the second part of this text poses a huge problem, it seems to  contradict the first part, but it doesn't. Because of the note, there is hope. You know what the hope is, it's in the very final verse, it's in the very, almost the final  word of Moses, where he says, for the Lord is your life. Let me tell you what's going on there, let me tell you what an incredible promise that  is, the first time in the Bible that that statement is made, and I think it's the last  time in the whole Old Testament. See up to now, life, and we're not talking about biological life, right?

Choose life. It's not biological life, so what are they saying? It's spiritual life, it's eternal life, it's the new heart and all that. Talked about that last week. So choose life.

Up until this point, life is connected with obedience, and death is connected with disobedience. If you obey, you'll get life, in other words, your obedience is your life. And if you disobey, you'll get death, in other words, your disobedience is your death. So choose life, so obey. And all the way through the book up to now, that's what it's been telling you, your obedience  is your life.

Every time this word life, the spiritual life thing comes up, it says, if you obey, you'll  get life, your obedience is your life, your obedience is your life. But verse 20, suddenly, suddenly, Moses basically says here, your obedience would be your life,  and it could be your life, but because it can't be your life, because you're not going  to keep it up, the Lord will be your life. What does that mean? Not that the Lord will give you life if you obey. That's not what it's saying.

It says the Lord will be your life, the Lord himself will be your life. What does that mean? Paul explains it in Romans 10. In Romans chapter 10, Paul comes to this very passage when he's proclaiming the gospel  of Jesus Christ to the readers of the book of Romans, to the Romans. He goes to this very passage and he interprets the passage in the most unbelievable way.

Here's what he says. This is Romans 10. Christ is the end of the law, says Paul, as a means of righteousness for everyone who believes. Now about this righteousness that comes through faith, Moses has said, quote, do not say in  your heart who will ascend into heaven, for that would bring Christ down. And he says, do not say who will descend into the deep, for that would bring Christ, that  would be to bring Christ up from the abyss, but what does it say?

What does Moses say? He says, the word is near you, it is in your mouth and in your heart, that is the word  of faith we are proclaiming, that if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe  in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Did you hear that? Look, first of all, he says, Christ is the end of the law, not period. He says, Christ is the end of the law for righteousness.

It's still there to please God, to change your life, but it's no longer a means to stand  before God, righteousness and accept it, don't I know? Why not? Jesus went into the abyss. Jesus went on the quest for eternal life. Moses says, Paul says, Moses says you don't have to go to heaven, no because Jesus has come  down from heaven.

Paul says, Moses says you don't have to go over to see because Jesus went into the depths  of the sea and he took the destructive forces and he received a destruction that we deserve. He took the curses in himself, he was destroyed. He went on a great quest, he went on the quest. He won eternal life and now he gives it to us as a gift, but I want you to know one thing. The quest of Jesus Christ was different than any other quest that's ever happened.

I read a scholarly article some years ago that really blew my socks off. It was amazing. First of all, it was a scholarly article. It was by a scholar who was actually trying to look and speak broadly about almost all  the ancient mythic prehistories of all the different cultures, whether Northern European  or Mediterranean, Greek and Roman or Asian, and they were looking at all these stories  and all these legends and they all had, there was a certain pattern to all of them. That was, you had these strong heroic figures who went on quests to win something.

They were all about that. All the legends were like that. Strong heroic figures who went on quests to win something and then the article amazingly  said this, the scholar of the last generation who knew the most in the entire world about  these ancient myths and legends, knew them in the originals and all that. The scholar of the last generation who knew most more about them than anybody else alive  was J.R. R.

Tolkien, who was an Oxford professor. This article said, secondly, he loved them so much that he wanted to write his own. He wanted to write his own mythic story about a quest and he did, but 0.3, he was so saturated  with Christianity and so saturated with the Christian gospel that his story is almost the  antithesis of every other mythic prehistory that ever happened. Because every single other ancient legend has a strong figure going off to save the world  by winning something. But in Tolkien and in the gospel, the world is saved by a weak figure who triumphs through  losing and goes off quest not to gain something but to lose something.

You see at the heart of history and at the heart of ours is a suffering servant who  triumphed through losing, who fell into the dark so we could live in the light. And that's the reason why Jesus quest is different than all these other self-saving, self-justifying  quests in all the other cultures. And that's the reason why there's one Christian poet Edward Chilato who addressing Jesus  spoke to him this way. The other gods were strong but thou was weak. They rode but thou just stumbled to your throne.

But to our wounds only God's wounds can speak and not a God has wounds but thou alone. The other gods were strong but thou was weak. They rode but you did stumble to your throne. You are wounds only God's wounds can speak and there's no God in any of the religion  that has wounds but thou alone. The simplicity is the difficulties, let me close like this.

If you are exploring Christianity or if you have maybe come to, you know, you may be  erased in a church and now you're trying to think, well, what's my relationship to Christianity? Tell my word, please realize that in some ways understand the difficulty of the simplicity  and grasping the simplicity in all of its difficulty is how you become a Christian. You want to know how to become a Christian? You want to know how to get a covenant relationship with God? That's it.

You say, well, that's paradoxical. What do you mean? Give me a perfect case study. In 1740s, there were a group of young men who were actually all part of the church. In fact, I think some of them were ordained ministers.

They were in the Church of England and they were in London but they knew there was something  missing. They knew they didn't have a personal relationship with God. They didn't have a covenant relationship with God. They didn't have a new heart. They began a set of evening meetings in which they read to each other Luther's preface to  the Galatians, Martin Luther's preface to the book of the Galatians.

On successive nights over a period of a week or so, John Wesley, founder of the Methodist  Church, Charles Wesley, great hymn writer and his brother and a whole lot of their friends  got converted. When the penny dropped of the simplicity of the grace of God, here's one of the men  named William Holland that you wouldn't have heard of, but it's a perfect example of  what happened. This is his diary. Mr. Charles Wesley read aloud and at the place where Luther said, what have we then  nothing to do?

No, nothing. But only to accept him who of God is made unto us who becomes for us, our wisdom, our  righteousness, our sanctification, our redemption. And adhering those words, there came such a power over me as I cannot well imagine my  end described. My heart was so filled with peace and love that I burst into tears and went afterwards  I went into the street. I could scarcely feel the ground I trot upon.

Now what happened was the simplicity of grace hit him. And the moment that happened, and the moment he was willing to pay those to cost, to get  rid of your pride, to say from now on, I'll never be able to look down at anybody, and  to get rid of any control of your life, because now you know you owe him everything, everything  to his mercy. If you're willing to pay those prices and the simplicity of grace happens at that moment  you are becoming a Christian, at that moment you are entering into that personal relationship  with God. And you say, well, if, what if I already believe? You have a final word for me, sure.

The life, the life that's in you. God is your life. Because of Jesus, he's your life now. It's guaranteed. It's in you.

That's why Colossians 3, Paul says, and 1 John 3, they talks about our life is hid with  God. Our life is in God. And we really don't even know what we're going to be. And when Jesus Christ is revealed on the last day, we know we'll be like Him. I mean, it's over the top.

The life that started in you is just a sea. You're just a shadow of what you're going to be. See us Lewis describes though what you are going to be. Live in hope of this. He will make the feeblest and filthiest of us into dazzling radiant immortal creatures, pulsating  through with an energy, joy, wisdom and love as we cannot now imagine.

He can make us all bright, stainless mirrors which reflect back to God perfectly though on  a smaller scale, his own boundless power, delight and goodness. That is what we are in for. Nothing less. Let's pray. Thank you, Father.

Thank you, Father. That through Jesus Christ, you can be our life. We thank you for the life that you've planted in so many of us. We thank you for the hope that that gives us as we think about our future. And we thank you for the difficult simplicity of the gospel.

And we pray that you would keep us from letting our pride throw us, letting our snobbishness  overlook it, letting our self-satisfaction keep us from working out the radical implications  of the gospel for every area of our life. So we ask that you would help us now to really receive your life through Jesus Christ. We choose it. We ask in Jesus' name, amen.

### 引言：信仰的开放性

当谈到公开你的信仰时，你有多自在？本月的播客中，Tim Keller 探讨了圣经对公开信仰的看法。他向我们展示了在多元化社会中，以一种创造文明、和平和与邻居有意义对话的方式公开我们的信仰是什么样的。

早上好。今天早上的经文取自《申命记》第30章第11-20节。

> “我今日所吩咐你的诫命不是你难以遵守的，也不是离你很远的。不是在天上，使你说，谁为我们上天取下来，使我们听见可以遵行呢？也不是在海外，使你说，谁为我们过海取来，使我们听见可以遵行呢？这话却离你甚近，就在你口中，在你心里，使你可以遵行。看哪，我今日将生与福，死与祸，陈明在你面前。吩咐你爱耶和华你的神，遵行他的道，谨守他的诫命、律例、典章，使你可以存活，人数增多，耶和华你神就必在你所要进去得为业的地上赐福与你。倘若你心里偏离不肯听从，却被勾引去敬拜事奉别神，我今日明明告诉你们，你们必要灭亡，在你过约旦河进去得为业的地上，日子必不长久。我今日呼天唤地向你作见证，我将生死、祸福陈明在你面前，所以你要拣选生命，使你和你的后裔都得存活，并且爱耶和华你的神，听从他的话，专靠他，因为他是你的生命，你的日子长久也在乎他。这样，你就可以在耶和华向你列祖亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各起誓应许赐给他们的地上居住。”

这是主的话。

### 约的简单性

我们一直在研究《申命记》，我们说这是摩西在他生命的最后对他的百姓所讲的一系列讲道，现在我们真的到了系列的结尾，也到了他最后一篇讲道的结尾。在第16节，我们看到在最后，他说，他命令，这个词命令意味着他在呼召或委托他的百姓与神建立约的关系。

**所以，主，你是神，行在他的道中，过去几周我们一直在看这个，与神的约关系是非常个人化的，但又是约束性的，并且是全生命转变的。** 在最后，摩西只是说，与神建立那种约的关系。

现在，这段经文最有趣的事情之一就是它的简单性和基本性。它是如此基本，如此直接。选择。这是你可以做的一件事。做这个。不要做这个。这会带来这个。那会带来那个。如此简单。

### 迷惑的平凡性

#### 1. 简单性作为挑战

事实上，它是如此简单。我实际上有点挣扎。我仍然在这段经文上挣扎，你知道为什么吗？传道人喜欢把一段难懂的经文变得简单。然后每个人都说，哦，比我想象的简单。他真棒。他是个很棒的老师，好吧。我实际上相信我的工作是今天把一段极其简单的经文展示出它的难度。我相信这就是摩西想要告诉我们的。

摩西开始说，看，我在向你提供这种与神的个人关系。他实际上在说，这并不难。它就在你身边。你不必上天。你不必越过海洋。他实际上在说，我告诉你的简单性就是它的难度。人们错过了与神的约关系，因为它太简单了。**简单性就是它的难度。**

#### 2. 神话语的可及性

第14节说，这个词，这个进入与神个人关系的命令就在你身边。然后他说，这是什么意思？好吧，理解这一点的方法之一是第12节。他说，这不是在天上，以至于你必须说，谁会上天去取下来并向我们宣告，以便我们可以遵行。

现在，古代文化，所有古代人民都相信神圣的智慧，神圣的知识，宇宙的秘密，生命意义的秘密，如何生活的秘密，死后会发生什么的秘密。宇宙的秘密是难以找到的东西，因为神或众神是遥远的，他们把牌藏在胸前。

古代传说充满了特别有天赋的纯洁的人，他们在身体或精神上升到天堂，他们有异象，或者他们有来自其他维度的访客，他们得到隐晦的神谕言辞，他们拼凑出只有他们拥有的真理。而摩西对此毫不接受。

当他说，你不必上天去得到这个时，他在说什么？他说，因为神，整本《申命记》都在说，天和最高的天都无法容纳的神，已经降临。他降临在西奈山。摩西一再说，神亲自降临并告诉你这些事情，并从火中对你说话，记得吗？

那么摩西在说什么？如果你想要宇宙的秘密，你不必是一个专家精英科学家。你也不必是一个非常复杂的艺术家诗人。你不只是在阿斯彭的一个独家静修会上得到它。你不必爬山去得到它，你知道为什么吗？它几乎在每个酒店房间的抽屉里。它在圣经中揭示，圣经无处不在。它是最容易获得的书籍，是世界上最容易获得的文本，书面东西和印刷品。

### 威胁的恩典

#### 1. 恩典的简单性

现在，你看，我们说，当摩西说，这在你身边，意思是你不必上天去得到它，因为它在圣经中揭示。但现在这里有另一个想法。他说，我今天所吩咐你的，11节，并不难以遵守，也不超出你的能力，为什么？它不在海洋之外，以至于你必须问，谁将越过海洋去得到它？

现在，海洋在古代世界中是一个有点不同的隐喻。海洋是混乱和毁灭的象征。事实上，保罗，我们会回到这一点，保罗在《罗马书》第10章中引用了这整段经文。但当他在《罗马书》第10章中引用这段经文时，他称海洋为深渊。当然，还有几部好电影，顺便说一下。有一部关于海洋的好电影叫《深渊》。因为在古代，海洋代表死亡，毁灭。航海者比陆地上的人更脆弱。因此，海洋代表深渊和死亡。

#### 2. 拿阿曼的故事

如果你想要一个完美的例子，这是一个很好的例子，是《列王纪下》第5章中拿阿曼的圣经故事。在《列王纪下》第5章中，我们被告知拿阿曼是一个叙利亚将军，他患了麻风病，他知道如果不治愈他就会死，他听说了以色列的神和他的力量。所以他决定去以色列，找到先知以利沙，寻求他的医治和拯救。

文本告诉我们他如何出发，以及他带来的东西显示他理解自己在进行一场探险。他带着金子和宝藏去购买他必须购买的任何东西。他带着剑，准备做一件伟大的事，因为他是一个有勇气和英勇的人。他带着国王的推荐信，等等，他到达先知的房子，以利沙甚至没有出来。相反，他被以利沙的仆人告知，去约旦河洗澡。

拿阿曼愤怒地跑开了，他的仆人追上他，他们说，主人，主人，如果先知告诉你做一件伟大的事，你难道不会去做吗？这就是重点。他就像所有人，所有古代人，所有现代人。如果有拯救，我们将实现它，我们必须证明我们的价值，我们必须从狮子的头上跳跃，我们必须拔出剑，我们必须做一些伟大的事。

### 不可思议的应许

#### 1. 生命的应许

我的意思是什么？你们是聪明人，这是纽约，所以如果你在读那段经文，你会意识到我一直在集中在经文的第一部分，这似乎全是关于恩典的。你不必上天，你不必越过海洋，它就在你的口中和心里，你必须在心里相信并用口承认，它在那里，它就在那儿，但然后你到达最后一部分，似乎第二部分完全与刚才所说的相矛盾，因为它说，你看，如果你的心偏离而你不顺服，如果你被引诱去敬拜其他神，我今日明明告诉你，你必定被毁灭。

#### 2. 耶稣的角色

保罗在《罗马书》第10章中解释了这一点。在《罗马书》第10章中，保罗在向《罗马书》的读者宣讲耶稣基督的福音时，来到这段经文。他来到这段经文，并以最不可思议的方式解释了这段经文。这是他说的。这是《罗马书》第10章。基督是律法的终结，保罗说，作为每个相信者的义的手段。

> “现在关于通过信仰而来的义，摩西说，引用，不要在心里说，谁将升到天上，因为那将把基督带下来。他说，不要说谁将降到深渊，因为那将把基督带上来，但它说什么？摩西说，话语就在你身边，在你的口中和心里，那就是我们所宣讲的信心的话语，如果你用口承认耶稣是主，并在心里相信神使他从死里复活，你就必得救。”

你听到了吗？看，首先，他说，基督是律法的终结，不是句号。他说，基督是义的律法的终结。它仍然存在以取悦神，改变你的生活，但不再是站在神面前的手段，义和接受，不是吗？为什么不呢？耶稣进入了深渊。耶稣为了永生而进行了探险。

### 结论

如果你正在探索基督教，或者如果你可能已经来到，你知道，你可能是在教会中长大的，现在你正在思考，好吧，我与基督教的关系是什么？告诉我的话，请意识到，在某些方面，理解简单性的难度，并在其所有难度中掌握简单性是你成为基督徒的方式。你想知道如何成为基督徒吗？你想知道如何与神建立约的关系吗？就是这样。

**你说，那是矛盾的。你是什么意思？给我一个完美的案例研究。**

在1740年代，有一群年轻人，他们实际上都是教会的一部分。事实上，我认为他们中的一些人是被任命的牧师。他们在伦敦的英格兰教会，但他们知道有些东西缺失了。他们知道他们没有与神的个人关系。他们没有与神的约关系。他们没有新的心。他们开始了一系列晚间会议，在这些会议上，他们互相朗读路德对《加拉太书》的序言，马丁·路德对《加拉太书》的序言。在一周左右的时间里，约翰·卫斯理，卫理公会教会的创始人，查尔斯·卫斯理，伟大的赞美诗作家和他的兄弟，以及他们的许多朋友都皈依了。

当恩典的简单性落地时，这里有一个名叫威廉·霍兰德的人，你可能没有听说过，但这是一个完美的例子。这是他的日记。

> “查尔斯·卫斯理先生大声朗读，在路德说的地方，我们有什么要做的吗？没有，什么都没有。只是接受他，神为我们成就的，他成为我们的智慧，我们的义，我们的成圣，我们的救赎。在听到这些话时，有一种力量降临在我身上，我无法很好地想象和描述。我的心充满了平安和爱，以至于我流下了眼泪，之后我走到街上。我几乎感觉不到我所走的地面。”

现在发生的是恩典的简单性击中了他。那一刻发生了，当他愿意支付那些代价，放下你的骄傲，说从现在开始，我将永远无法看不起任何人，并放弃对你生活的任何控制，因为现在你知道你欠他一切，一切都归于他的怜悯。如果你愿意支付那些代价，恩典的简单性发生在那一刻，你正在成为基督徒，在那一刻你正在进入与神的个人关系。

你说，好吧，如果，我已经相信了呢？你有最后的话要对我说吗？当然。生命，生命在你里面。神是你的生命。因为耶稣，他现在是你的生命。这是有保证的。它在你里面。这就是为什么保罗在《歌罗西书》第3章中说，和《约翰一书》第3章中，他们谈到我们的生命隐藏在神里面。我们的生命在神里面。我们真的不知道我们将成为什么。当耶稣基督在最后一天显现时，我们知道我们将像他一样。我是说，这超出了想象。开始在你里面的生命只是一个种子。你只是你将成为的影子。

**看我们路易斯描述了你将成为的样子。活在这种希望中。他将使我们中最虚弱和最污秽的人变成耀眼的、不朽的生物，充满着我们现在无法想象的能量、喜悦、智慧和爱。他可以使我们所有人变成明亮、无瑕的镜子，完美地反射给神，尽管在较小的规模上，他自己无边的力量、喜悦和善良。这就是我们所期待的。没有其他。**

让我们祷告。

谢谢你，父亲。谢谢你，父亲。通过耶稣基督，你可以成为我们的生命。我们感谢你在我们许多人中种下的生命。我们感谢你给我们的希望，因为我们思考我们的未来。我们感谢你福音的困难简单性。我们祈求你让我们不因骄傲而被抛弃，不因自负而忽视它，不因自满而阻止我们在生活的每个领域中实现福音的激进影响。所以我们请求你现在帮助我们真正通过耶稣基督接受你的生命。我们选择它。我们奉耶稣的名祈求，阿们。
