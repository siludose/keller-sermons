Today Tim Keller is exploring how the Spirit calls us to faith, unites us together, equips  us with gifts and shapes us to be more like Christ. The Scripture reading this morning comes from John's Gospel, chapter 14, verses 16-26. And I will ask the Father and He will give you another counselor to be with you forever,  the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept Him because it neither sees Him nor knows Him, but you know Him  for He lives with you and will be in you. I will not leave you as orphans, I will come to you.

Before long the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me because I live, you also  will live. On that day you will realize that I am in my Father and you are in me and I am in you. Whoever has my commands and obeys them, He is the one who loves me. He who loves me will be loved by my Father and I too will love Him and show myself to  Him. Then Judas, not Judas Iscariot, said, but Lord, why do you intend to show yourself  to us and not to the world?

Jesus replied, If anyone loves me, He will obey my teaching. My Father will love Him and we will come to Him and make our home with Him. He who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own, they belong to the Father who sent me. All this I have spoken while still with you, but the counselor, the Holy Spirit whom  the Father will send in my name will teach you all things and will remind you of everything  I have said to you.

This is the Word of the Lord. In the summertime, of course, because of vacations, there are multiple preachers up here and in  order to keep ourselves unified and make sure that we are working together, we choose a common  theme and what we are going to be doing from now all the way into the middle of September  is looking at what the Bible teaches about the Holy Spirit, the doctrine of the Holy  Spirit. My impression is that there is an awful lot of churches in the world that talk about  nothing but spiritual experience and there is an awful lot of churches that are just  absolutely afraid of the subject and just want to talk about doctrine and truth and  knowing the right things. But I think the remedy for that imbalance is the doctrine of the Holy Spirit because  the deeper you get into it, the more you realize that spirit and truth go together and that's  what we are going to be doing over the next number of weeks. This is an introduction, let's take a look at what this great passage tells us about who  of the Holy Spirit is, what He does and then how you can receive what He gives.

Who He is, what He does, how you can receive what He gives, very top level, very basic  intro, but wonderful. First, who is He? Who is the Holy Spirit and by the way, I already gave you a bit of an answer by the choice  of my pronoun. The Holy Spirit is a personal, is the personal divine resident of the Christian's heart. The Holy Spirit is the personal divine resident of the Christian's heart.

First of all, personal. Have you noticed that Jesus refers to the Holy Spirit, not as it, as we tend to do, not  as an energy or as a force, but as He, you see, like, you know, right away, right in  where He says, the world cannot accept Him, He, a person, in Ephesians 430, the Holy Spirit  is said to be grieved. You can grieve the Holy Spirit. In Hebrews 10, 29, it says you can outrage the Holy Spirit in Romans 15, it says, the Holy  Spirit loves, so He loves, He's grieved, He's outraged, an impersonal force cannot feel  all those feelings, that's a person. But He's not only a person, He's God.

So for example, right up here, it says, and I will ask the Father and He will give you  another counselor, we'll get to the word counselor in a minute. But Jesus says, He's another counselor, I'm a counselor, He's another one. Now there's two ways, there's two Greek words that could be used to talk about another. There's this one, and then there's another one. The one Greek word for another is hetero, which means actually a posed or different to  the former.

The other Greek word that could be used is alos, which means just like the former. Now you've got to realize what Jesus is saying here, because Jesus made some enormous  claims about Himself. Jesus said, there's a place in John 8 where He says, before Abraham was, I am. He takes the divine name that God gave to Moses and the burning bush. Jesus says, it's me, I am.

Before Abraham was, I am. Jesus claims to forgive all sins. You know what that means? When He says, I can forgive all sins, that means all sins are against me, because you can  only forgive the sins that are against you. Jesus says He's going to judge the world.

So Jesus is constantly saying, I am equal to God. And now He has the audacity to come along and say, I'm sending you someone who's  just like me. The Holy Spirit is a person, the Holy Spirit is God, and what we are into right now is  the dizzying doctrine of the Trinity. Can I make you a little dizzy with it? In verse two, which we didn't read, in verse two of this chapter, Jesus is all about saying,  I'm going away.

I'm going away, okay? Then here it says, in verse 16, He says, but the Holy Spirit is coming. And then you go down into verse 21, He says, my father, and I will love you. And in verse 21, 22, and 23, He says, we will come to you. So He says, I'm going away, the Holy Spirit is coming, and therefore I'm coming.

And Jesus is not saying, oh, I'm not really going away, I'm coming to you in the form  of the Holy Spirit. Or on the other hand, as He's saying, oh, I'm going away, and therefore I'm not coming,  He's coming. He is so one with the Holy Spirit that when the Holy Spirit comes into your life, Jesus  comes. And yet He is not so identical to the Holy Spirit that He isn't also already away, and  therefore in heaven. Got that?

Okay? See how easy that was? No, you know, here's, Jesus is saying, there's not three gods, because there are two  one to be three gods. On the other hand, it's not one person in three forms. You know, there he has his father, half, and he has his son, half, and he has this Holy  Spirit hat.

It's not three gods, there are two one for that, but it's not one god in three forms,  there are two three for that. It's one god in three persons. And we're going to, in the next year, we're going to get back to this doctrine. All I can tell you is, in the early days of my Christian faith, it was a millstone  around my neck. It felt like this is so confusing, and today I think it's one of the greatest things.

It's one of the joys I've got when I contemplated it. Once you get to understand it, you see the beauty of it, and I can't go into any further than  that, because we're here not to talk about the Trinity, but the Holy Spirit. But here's what I want you to see, why so important. The Holy Spirit is not an impersonal force. The Holy Spirit is a divine person in the middle of your life.

Why does that matter? Oh, it matters. Because the Bible talks about being filled with the Holy Spirit. Later on, we'll have a whole sermon on that, being filled with the Holy Spirit. But being filled with the Holy Spirit is to experience incredible divine joy and power.

I want that, and I want that for you. So how do you get filled with the Spirit? If you are filled with the Spirit and you think of the Spirit as an impersonal force, you're  going to go about seeking that in a different way than if you understand, you're being  filled with the Spirit and the Spirit is a person. If you try to get filled with an impersonal force, you go about it in a mechanical way. So for example, Eastern thought conceived God, the divine, as an impersonal force.

Eastern thought sees the divine as an impersonal force. And therefore, it's approach to, Eastern thought's approach, is meditation. But the meditation is always emptying the mind of thought, rational thought, emptying the  mind of words. You emptied the mind of it. Why?

Because we're trying to get in touch with the force. And whatever you get into the Bible and you see the word meditation comes up a lot. But Christian meditation, biblical meditation, is not emptying the mind of rational thoughts  and words. Feeling the mind with the words of God is a completely different approach. If you don't, if you think of the Holy Spirit as an it, you're going to be moving in a mechanical  approach.

In fact, I really do see an awful lot of Christian teaching on being filled with the Spirit  that does sort of see the Spirit as a kind of electrical charge. And therefore, the way you get filled with the Spirit is by pushing buttons. You pray in certain ways, you do certain things, you refrain from certain things, you repent  for certain things, and you kind of, you push all the right buttons and you get your  life into some kind of environmental condition. And then in it comes, it, no, no. If the Spirit is a person, then to be filled with a Spirit is like being filled with a person.

How does that work? Well, I know, for example, that when I was young, sometimes my parents would, if there was  a visitor that came into our home for a while, a weekend or something like that. It was a person that my parents really respected. It could have been a visiting, dignitary, visiting speaker, or a member of the family that they  had high regard for. It affected everything.

First of all, for some reason the house looked beautiful. Suddenly we made our living space just physically look beautiful. But then secondly, everybody was on their best behavior, and it wasn't a sham. The point is the little things that used to just rub us the wrong way just didn't matter,  because this person was here. And we hung on this person's words to be filled with a Spirit is to have your life transformed  by an acute consciousness of the glorious person that lives permanently within the walls  of your life.

I've told you this before, I remember once counseling a man who had had an affair and blew  up his life, and he had been cheating on his wife. But he told me that whenever he would bring, if his wife was a wife, he would bring his  mistress into the home. He had a turnover all the pay, and I tell you this recently, any picture of his wife,  any picture of himself and his wife or any picture of his wife, he had a take down  or turnover. Because neither he nor the mistress could bear even the photograph face of his wife. Because even the presence of the picture would affect his behavior.

Do you know who's living in your life? Are you melted by spiritual understanding, by an acute consciousness of the glorious  person that's there to change the way in which you live? Just the awareness of it fills you with a sense of his presence, and it would bring integrity  to your life. You're doing right now that you wouldn't do if you were aware of him being there. If you turn the pictures back over and you say, oh, I might think about this.

Of course, it also means to hang on his words. Be filled with the Spirit is very different than to be filled with a force, which leads  us to the second point. The Holy Spirit is a personal divine resident of the Christian heart. Secondly, what does the Holy Spirit do? There are two words here that tell us what he does and they're great.

He is a Spirit of Truth, verse 17, and he is a counselor. He's a Spirit of Truth and a counselor. So first, he is the Spirit of Truth. What does this mean? At one level, we know this, that the Holy Spirit essentially authored the Bible.

The Holy Spirit literally is the author of the Bible. So for example, in 2 Peter 1, it says this, no prophecy of Scripture came about by the  prophet's own interpretation. For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were  carried along by the Holy Spirit. And then here, this is John 6, verse 63, where Jesus says, the words I speak to you are  spirit and life. In other words, the words of Jesus that you see in the Bible were produced by the Spirit  and if you embrace them and receive them and understand them, they give you eternal  life.

So the Holy Spirit, at one level, is the author of the Scripture. In fact, and see, this goes back to this idea of what it means to be filled with the Spirit  if the Spirit's a person as opposed to a force. If you go to Ephesians 5.18, the famous passage in which Paul says, be filled with the Spirit  and then he makes a list of the traits of a Spirit-filled life which we won't go into  right now. We have a sermon coming up on that later. Be filled with the Spirit, Ephesians 5.18, and then there's a list.

If you go to another one of his letters, Colossians, and if you go to chapter 3, and Paul  wrote these letters to different churches, but he often said similar things because he  was writing to churches and he got the same basic truths across. If you go to Colossians 3.16, it says, be filled with the Word. It says, be filled with the Word. And then it makes a list of the Word-filled life. He says, let the Word dwell richly in you, which is the same as be filled with the Word.

Then it gives a list of traits, and they're the same traits. This Paul said in Ephesians 5.18, where the traits of a Spirit-filled life, you know what  this means? See, to be filled with a person, to be dominated by a person, is to hang on that person's  every word. It means to be dominated and saturated by the Scripture. To let it dwell in your richly is not the same thing as knowing it as information, so take  it in.

It's to make it part of yourself, or another way to put it is this. You can look at glasses, but that's really not why I spent so much money on these. I did not go to the optician and spend hundreds of dollars on this, just so I could sit them  down and say, hey honey, come look at my glasses, that doesn't work that way. You put them on and you look at everything else through them. And the Scripture, it's one thing to look at the Scripture, and to say, I'm going to  learn the facts.

It's another thing to let it dwell in your richly. It's another thing to be saturated by it. It's another thing to so take it in that you look at everything else through it. And therefore, to be filled with the Word and to be filled with the Spirit is the same  thing because he's a spirit of truth. In fact, he goes on beyond that, though.

We already referred to it here, looking verse 21, whoever has my commands, that's the  word, and obeys them. He is the one who loves me. He who loves me will be loved by my Father and I too will love him, and I will show myself  to him. Now that's interesting. What does this mean?

Here are some people who obviously believe in Jesus, and who obviously are obeying Jesus  and they're reading the Word of God, and Jesus says, I will come and show myself to them. This is in this passage on the Holy Spirit, I will come and show myself to them. Now, what does that mean? Does they not know who he is? Of course they know who he is.

What is that? What is the Holy Spirit taking the words and making them life, taking the words and making  them power? Here's another place where Paul talks about it, and listen, this is actually one of the  most important verses in the Bible to me personally. This is Ephesians 3, Paul says, I pray, he's praying for his friends. He says, I pray that out of his glorious riches he will strengthen you with power through  his spirit in your inner being so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.

And I pray that you being rooted and established in love may have power to grasp how wide,  and long, and high, and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses  knowledge that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God. He's talking to Christians, and he says, by the power of the Spirit, I'm praying that  through the power of the Spirit Christ may dwell in your hearts, but Christ is already  dwell in their hearts. They wouldn't be Christians. And then he says, I'm praying that by the power of the Spirit, you may grasp. You may have power to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ.

Don't they already know about the love of Christ? Of course they wouldn't be Christians. He says, but I want you to know this love that surpasses knowledge. What's he talking about? Let me just give you an example.

John Kineber's Quiet Time Notebook is a little journal, he wrote. He says, I have, at many times, had the greatest delight in the Holy Scriptures of any book whatsoever. Oftentimes in reading, it every word seems to touch my heart. I seem often to see so much light exhibited by every sentence and have such a refreshing,  ravishing, food communicated from these words that I cannot get along in my reading. I'm often used to dwell long on one sentence to see the wonders contained in it.

The sense I had of divine things as I read the Scripture would often of a sudden,  as it were kindle of a sweet burning in my heart, an order of my soul that I know not how to express. Though he's not doing too bad a job right there. What's he talking about? It's one thing to read the Scripture. It's another thing to have the Holy Spirit come and reveal Jesus Christ to you in it.

It's one thing to know, Christ dwells in your heart, it's another thing to sense it. We talked about this actually last week. It's one thing to know with your head that sugar is sweet, it's another thing to taste it  and have your whole being electrified by it. You not only know it, but you sense it, and that's the job of the Holy Spirit. He is the author, not only of objective truth, because he wrote the Bible,  but of subjective truth, he makes it live in your life.

He makes it live, he makes it vivid and powerful, he makes it life-changing,  and that's the first thing the Holy Spirit does. But believe it or not, that's not all. Because actually, if this is all he did, he still would be a kind of consultant,  or somebody who hired just to come in and give you certain things at certain times. But that's not all he is. He's also a counselor.

I mean, this is the main point of this whole passage. I will ask the Father and He will give you another counselor. Now, if you go to five or six translations,  get out all your different translations, you're going to have five or six different words. And whenever you see English translations with very different words and every translation,  that means that the word that's used here is too rich for one English word to convey  and so the translators are struggling. Some of you may have the Old King James Bible,  and there's a number of other translations that say,  and I will ask the Father and He will give you another comforter.

Now, that's a really sweet word, but it does make the Holy Spirit sound like a quilt. So they don't use that much anymore. But even this word, counselor, is this a camp counselor? Is this a marriage counselor? No.

Actually, they do know one thing, and this is the reason why we don't have a good word to come out with it. Basically, what the commentators know, this word is,  this is the word paracaleo, or paracleic, paracleesis. It's actually a very difficult word to translate. Parameans not to be in front or behind, but to stand alongside. Kaleo means to declare, to call, to argue, actually.

And therefore, the best way to translate this is I'm going to send you another legal advocate. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God. Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365-day devotional, the songs of Jesus,  you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a regular devotional practice,  this book is a wonderful way to start.

And if you already spend time and study in prayer,  then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest emotions  and questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with Him. We'll send you Tim and Kathy Keller's devotional as our thanks for your gift  to help Gospel and Life share the love of Jesus with more people.

This person stands in your position, represents you. This person is loyal to you to the end. This is a person who is for you in the strongest sense. But on the other hand, it also means this is a person who argues. This is a person who debates.

This is a person who makes a case. This is a person who defends you against your enemies. There's a soft side that's the sympathy with you and there's a hard side. Now why in the world would Jesus Christ say that the Holy Spirit is your legal advocate? What does that mean?

And here's what I believe it means. The Holy Spirit's job is to defend you against the enemies here on earth,  but especially the enemies inside your own heart. For example, in Romans 8, 15, it says, God has not given us a spirit of fear,  but he's given us the spirit of his son who comes into a heart-crying oba father. You know what that means? Your heart's filled with fears, fears.

And the Holy Spirit comes in and argues and says, no, God loves you. You're a his child. Then one verse later, Romans 8, 16, it says, the Spirit bears witness with our spirit  that we're children of God. We actually talked about this last week, what I didn't bring out is the word bears witness  is a technical Greek word that means the star witness in court. A person bringing testimony, legal testimony in court that basically settles the case.

And so what this is saying is, your heart's filled with doubts. Your heart's filled with doubts. And in comes the Holy Spirit and says, no, there's no reason to doubt. You are his. You are loved.

Or there's this great spot in Hebrews 12, which is all about suffering  and all the troubles that come to us. And in Hebrews 12, it says, have you forgotten the word of  exhortation that argues with you? That's what the Greek word means as children. My son do not make light of the Lord's discipline for he disciplines those he loves. The Hebrews writer is quoting Proverbs 3 and he's saying that the job of the Holy  Scripture is to argue with you when you're cast down.

Suffering has happened to you. Bad things have happened to you. And you feel like, oh, I'm being abandoned. No, according to the book of Hebrews, he says, the Scripture argues with you. How?

As children, the Scripture argues and says, no, you are his child. He has not abandoned you. Good fathers often put their children through paces. And that's what's happening to you right now. Now, what does all this mean?

You know, there's a place in 1 John 3.20 where it says, when our hearts condemn us,  God is greater than our hearts. With a small paraphrase, I'm just going to say, when our hearts condemn us,  the Holy Spirit is greater than our hearts. It's the Holy Spirit's job to argue. Our hearts do not like the idea of grace. We don't really like the gospel, the idea that we're saved by grace.

We want to earn it. We want to merit it. It puts us in control. And because our hearts have got that part there,  we're constantly being buffeted by fears, by doubts. When bad things happen, we say, no, no, he's abandoned us.

I'm not good enough. He can't possibly love me and the Holy Spirit comes in and argues. He makes the case. He takes the gospel and pounds you until you start to relax. But it's not just that the Holy Spirit defends us against accusation.

He also defends us against temptation. In James 4, there's this strange spot where James first says,  do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity toward God? And then it says, don't you realize, and again, they don't know how to translate this. Don't you realize that the spirit of God within you envies you? Because sometimes they translate it lusts unto envy.

They don't know how to translate. You know what it's saying? It's saying don't you realize that when you start to let the world take you away from God  that the Holy Spirit within you longs for your love? The Holy Spirit sees us giving our heart to money, or giving our heart to fame,  or giving our heart to sex, or giving our heart to power instead of to God. And then the Holy Spirit when it sees our hearts tempting us away from God, knowing  this is going to destroy us.

The Holy Spirit acts the way of a loving friend acts toward an addict. What do you do when you love somebody and you see them destroying their lives through addiction? You get them into a corner and you say, you're killing yourself, I'm not going to let you do it. I'm going to confront you, I'm going to oppose you because I love you, I'm not going to let you do it. And you know what, you can almost come to blows over that.

You can have friends who come and tell you you're wrong, you're killing yourself,  I'm not going to let you do it. You can get so angry at them that you can have a fight. But this is what we've got when we have the Holy Spirit in our lives. This is a friend, this is a counselor, this is a legal advocate, this is someone who will not let  you kill yourself. He's a glorious person and Paul says in Philippians 1, the good work God  began in you, he will bring the completion of the day of Jesus Christ.

He's a glorious person  this Holy Spirit and he will not stop until you become the glorious person you should be. He is going to oppose anything in your heart that will scuttle you. And he's not going to let you go. This is a friend whose love has teeth in it. This is a friend who's utterly for you, which means sometimes he's against you for you.

He said, I should have thought twice about inviting this person into my life. No, I just want you to think about the implications. And therefore, yes, it's the job of the Holy Spirit to give you scripture. And then the job of the Holy Spirit to make that scripture real and vibrant and powerful in  your life. But he's not simply doing it, you know, just to give you spiritual experiences.

He's come into your life and he's utterly committed to bringing the good work God began with you  at the new birth to completion in the day of Jesus Christ. And he's not going to let you go. You see, he's a counselor. He's not like a camp counselor. You don't go home.

He's even not like a marriage counselor that you go to see. And then you say, I'm not getting  anything out of it. Okay. He's a permanent legal advocate. He's a permanent friend who's  willing to do interventions on you all the time.

He's for you, para. But he sometimes can be  against you for you. And that's the wonder of having the Holy Spirit in your life. Now,  lastly, very importantly, how can you be, well, I'm not going to say be full of the Spirit. We're going to go to that later.

But how can you be sure that you're receiving the benefits  that the Holy Spirit can offer you? And I think there's two answers in this text. We're just  sticking with the text. There's certainly more to much more to say about the Holy Spirit than we  have here. But we're going to stick with the text.

And here's the first thing. The key to the power of  the Holy Spirit operating in your life and making you what you should be and can be is understanding  the first advocate. See, when Jesus says, I'm going to send you another counselor. He's talking  about himself. Who's the first counselor?

Him. He's the first counselor. And this word,  parapleg, parapleg, legal advocate is used of Jesus, too, by the same author, John, not in the book  of John, but in the first epistle of John, where he says this. Now, this is the new international  translation. He says, I write this to you.

This is first John 21. I write this to you so that you will  not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense. Jesus  Christ the righteous. He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins.

Now, that's how the new international  version renders it. We have one who speaks to the Father in our defense. Actually, it just says  we have an advocate with the Father. We have a parapleg we have an advocate with the Father. And when the Bible says that when we sin, we have an advocate with the Father.

If we believe in  Jesus Christ, we have an advocate with the Father. Here's what the Bible is assuming. Number one,  it assumes that there is a bar of justice. There is a court before which all of us stand accused. That we're condemned.

And after 35 years, in fact, I realize that, you know, actually the first  sermon I ever preached at my very first church 35 years ago was on 4th of July Sunday. And my 35  years of pastoral work, I've seen lots and lots of people who tried desperately to get out from  under this idea that they're moral failures, this idea that they're condemned. One of the best  ways to do it is to move New York City where you're going to be told what's right or wrong. That's  you create that yourself. You decide what is right or wrong for you.

You don't let somebody else  is moral. You decide what is right or wrong for you. And for, you know, for a number of years,  you say, see, I don't have to feel guilty. I decide what is right or wrong for me. Until you realize  there's not a single person on the face of the earth that even lives up to the standards that you  have decided or right or wrong.

And the standards that you apply to everybody else. And I don't care  what happens. It could be you're successful in the beginning of your life and then realizes  life goes on that you've neglected your relationships and now you're lonely. Well, you're unsuccessful  early in life and you feel like a failure because of that or you just suffering hits you and whenever  suffering hits you, you realize you forces you to admit your moral flaws. Everybody in the end has  a sense that they're condemned.

Everybody knows they're a moral failure. It sleeps very deep  this sense in people for a long time and it might be sleeping deep in you. But there is a bar of justice. There is a court before which we all stand accused,  0.1, 0.2. The second thing that this passage assumes is that when you believe in Jesus Christ,  Jesus Christ stands before that just court of justice representing you,  representing you, interceding for you, making his case for you.

Now when I was a new Christian,  I read that spot. There's a place in Romans 8 where it says Jesus Christ ever lives to intercede. It's in Hebrews 7. It's in Romans 8 where it says Jesus Christ makes intercession for us before  the Father. And that was kind of a comfort for me because in my mind, what it meant was every time I  sinned, Jesus walked up and said, don't abandon him because, you know, be merciful or something like  that.

You know, he, I know he promised not to do that anymore and he did it anymore. Let's  give him one more chance. I guess I thought that's what he was doing. And that wasn't very comforting  to me because, you know, I always wonder how long can Jesus keep that up? You know, when is he  finally going to say, I'm not going to the Father one more time for this guy?

Or when's the Father  going to say, I'm sorry, you know, what this has been, you know, this has been five years now,  you know, he says, it didn't comfort me until I read a, actually, a, a sermon outline by a  man named Charles Hodge who was a, one of the, one of the professors at Princeton Theological Seminary  in the 19th century, like in the 1830s and 1840s. And he gave a chapel talk on Jesus Christ as the  advocate and something to change, changed my life long ago. He says, you know what? Jesus Christ  is your advocate. He is your legal representative before the, before the bar, before the, before the  court.

And one of the things you have to realize, he's not up there just pleading for mercy. That is  not what a legal advocate does. A legal advocate makes a case and he makes a case based on the law. And he's up there securing your status as not being condemned because of the law. He's not  up there pleading for mercy.

He's making a case. I said, what? And then this is what Charles Hodge  says is something like what we think. The Bible is trying to convey when it talks about Jesus  our legal advocate. It's almost as if, and I know this is, it's almost as if Jesus is saying, Father,  you are just and sin demands payment.

And this brother or sister of mine has sinned. He's not loved guy with all his heart, soul, strength of mine. He hasn't loved his neighbors  himself. He is sinned and his sin must be paid for. But Father, here's the payment.

Look at my  broken body. Look at my poor outblood. I have paid for it. And it would be unjust  to get two payments for the same sin. I've paid for it.

And therefore, I'm not just pleading for  mercy. I demand acquittal for my brother because I have paid for his sin. And therefore he cannot  pay for his sin. And therefore, there cannot be any condemnation of him. I demand acquittal.

It's  justice that he's pleading for. See, that's what Charles Hodge was saying. And when I realize that,  I hope you can come with me. I'm trying to get across in three minutes with what was kind of a watershed  for me. See, I realize all of the religion sort of see salvation as the scales.

You know, the justice  scales, you know, the blind lady with the scales, that's justice. And all I thought was that the moral  law of God, the divine justice was on one side of the scale. And I had to put in a ton of good works  on the other side just so it didn't kill me. See, the justice of God was against me. You better  be good.

You better be good. And I had to, you know, push up everything I possibly could out of my  own life. All the good deeds and all the prayers and going to church and everything. Get it on  that other scale. Otherwise, just a balance out of otherwise, I'm just cooked.

And I realize that  when you believe in Jesus Christ as your Savior, and when He becomes your legal advocate, it means  that justice of God is on your side. It would be unjust for God to take two payments for the same  sin. And your sins have been paid for. And therefore, the very justice of God, the omnipotent,  infallible, infinite justice of God, demands that there is no condemnation for you. Now, if we've  got that advocate up there doing that, what is the Holy Spirit doing down here?

The Holy Spirit  is our advocate on earth. Jesus Christ is our advocate in heaven. What the Holy Spirit is doing  is He's taking the advocacy in heaven and applying it here on earth against the enemies in your own  heart. He's pounding into you. He's dealing with your temptations.

He's dealing with your pride. He's dealing with your fears. He's dealing with your accusations. And he's saying, look at what  Jesus has done. The Holy Spirit, though, is not an advocate that points to himself.

J.I. Packer beautifully puts it. It's in John chapter 16 where it actually says, Jesus says,  the Holy Spirit will speak of me. He will glorify me. He will not speak of himself.

He will speak of  me. And J.I. Packer, who is an Anglican minister, one day was, he was preaching a sermon on the Holy  Spirit and he was looking for a good illustration on the way to preach. He saw a floodlight. He was kind of dark at night.

And he saw a floodlight lighting up an old building which in the  daytime didn't look very good, but at night looked beautiful. And he suddenly realized he couldn't  even tell where the floodlight was. He says, I couldn't even tell because the job of the floodlight  is not to call attention to itself. The job of the floodlight is to throw into relief the beauty  and the magnificence of the thing that is flooding. And he says, that's the Holy Spirit.

The Holy  Spirit's job is not to say, look at me. Get my power. Get my joy. The Holy Spirit's job is to say,  look at Jesus. Look at the beauty of what he's done.

Look at him standing up there. Look at his  advocacy for you. Do you not see that there's no danger? There is no failure. There is no accusation.

There is nothing that can overturn you. That can cast you down. Nothing. The Holy Spirit's job  is to pull. He's an advocate on earth pointing to our advocate in heaven, making the work of the  advocate in heaven so beautiful to your life that it changes it.

All right, look, two things. Number one, here's two ways I would like you to change your life on the basis of what I've  already said, even if you say, I've already got some things to change. All right, then these two  things. Would you please notice the magnificence of divine selflessness,  the magnificence of divine selflessness? Here's Jesus Christ, emptying self of His glory  in order to become a servant and die on the cross for our sins.

And now, here's the Holy Spirit,  not speaking of His own glory, but glorifying Jesus. There must be something deep in the heart of  God that is other oriented. There's a selflessness in God. There's something in God that says,  my life for yours. There's something in God that says, I'm here to serve you.

Here's Jesus emptying self of His glory. Here's the Holy Spirit only showing us Jesus glory. Are you always promoting yourself? Are you always upset because people aren't giving you your  due? Do you feel like you're not getting credit?

Do you find yourself always getting insulted? How  dare people talk to me like that or about me like that? Are you doing what a lot of New Yorkers  are doing, spending all their time just trying to get up the ladder and basically only dealing with  people if they serve you, serve your interest, help you with your agenda? If you want to be like the  divine person who comes and lives in the heart of a Christian, you have to be a person who is  characterized by the magnificence of divine selflessness. Get rid of your pride.

Stop promoting yourself  all the time. Be like the one who lives within you. But here's the second thing. Are you on the  other hand? Do you feel like an imposter?

Are you struggling with rejection? In New York, there's  always an audition. There's always a job interview. There's always, and we're always struggling with  rejection here. Are some of you struggling on off a lot?

Do you feel like a failure in many ways? Are you afraid to have any of the people around you realize how much you lack confidence? How much you right now almost load yourself? You need an advocate and you got one in heaven. You got one on earth.

You really got everything you need. Avail yourself of him. Let's pray. Our Father, we thank You for the gift of the Holy Spirit. We thank You for sending another  counselor into our lives.

Oh, how we do. Thank You for that. And we pray that You would help us  to be filled with the Spirit. We pray that You would help us to receive His counseling. We pray  that You would help us to cooperate with Him as He advocates for us.

And we ask that You would  help us to do this as an entire church so we truly would be a Spirit-filled church. The world will  do this and You'll be grateful. You'll be glad for us. You'll be, we'll be grateful to You and You'll  be glorified in us. And that's what we want.

We pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

Today Tim Keller is exploring how the Spirit calls us to faith, unites us together, equips  us with gifts and shapes us to be more like Christ. The Scripture reading this morning comes from John's Gospel, chapter 14, verses 16-26. And I will ask the Father and He will give you another counselor to be with you forever,  the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept Him because it neither sees Him nor knows Him, but you know Him  for He lives with you and will be in you. I will not leave you as orphans, I will come to you.

Before long the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me because I live, you also  will live. On that day you will realize that I am in my Father and you are in me and I am in you. Whoever has my commands and obeys them, He is the one who loves me. He who loves me will be loved by my Father and I too will love Him and show myself to  Him. Then Judas, not Judas Iscariot, said, but Lord, why do you intend to show yourself  to us and not to the world?

Jesus replied, If anyone loves me, He will obey my teaching. My Father will love Him and we will come to Him and make our home with Him. He who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own, they belong to the Father who sent me. All this I have spoken while still with you, but the counselor, the Holy Spirit whom  the Father will send in my name will teach you all things and will remind you of everything  I have said to you.

This is the Word of the Lord. In the summertime, of course, because of vacations, there are multiple preachers up here and in  order to keep ourselves unified and make sure that we are working together, we choose a common  theme and what we are going to be doing from now all the way into the middle of September  is looking at what the Bible teaches about the Holy Spirit, the doctrine of the Holy  Spirit. My impression is that there is an awful lot of churches in the world that talk about  nothing but spiritual experience and there is an awful lot of churches that are just  absolutely afraid of the subject and just want to talk about doctrine and truth and  knowing the right things. But I think the remedy for that imbalance is the doctrine of the Holy Spirit because  the deeper you get into it, the more you realize that spirit and truth go together and that's  what we are going to be doing over the next number of weeks. This is an introduction, let's take a look at what this great passage tells us about who  of the Holy Spirit is, what He does and then how you can receive what He gives.

Who He is, what He does, how you can receive what He gives, very top level, very basic  intro, but wonderful. First, who is He? Who is the Holy Spirit and by the way, I already gave you a bit of an answer by the choice  of my pronoun. The Holy Spirit is a personal, is the personal divine resident of the Christian's heart. The Holy Spirit is the personal divine resident of the Christian's heart.

First of all, personal. Have you noticed that Jesus refers to the Holy Spirit, not as it, as we tend to do, not  as an energy or as a force, but as He, you see, like, you know, right away, right in  where He says, the world cannot accept Him, He, a person, in Ephesians 430, the Holy Spirit  is said to be grieved. You can grieve the Holy Spirit. In Hebrews 10, 29, it says you can outrage the Holy Spirit in Romans 15, it says, the Holy  Spirit loves, so He loves, He's grieved, He's outraged, an impersonal force cannot feel  all those feelings, that's a person. But He's not only a person, He's God.

So for example, right up here, it says, and I will ask the Father and He will give you  another counselor, we'll get to the word counselor in a minute. But Jesus says, He's another counselor, I'm a counselor, He's another one. Now there's two ways, there's two Greek words that could be used to talk about another. There's this one, and then there's another one. The one Greek word for another is hetero, which means actually a posed or different to  the former.

The other Greek word that could be used is alos, which means just like the former. Now you've got to realize what Jesus is saying here, because Jesus made some enormous  claims about Himself. Jesus said, there's a place in John 8 where He says, before Abraham was, I am. He takes the divine name that God gave to Moses and the burning bush. Jesus says, it's me, I am.

Before Abraham was, I am. Jesus claims to forgive all sins. You know what that means? When He says, I can forgive all sins, that means all sins are against me, because you can  only forgive the sins that are against you. Jesus says He's going to judge the world.

So Jesus is constantly saying, I am equal to God. And now He has the audacity to come along and say, I'm sending you someone who's  just like me. The Holy Spirit is a person, the Holy Spirit is God, and what we are into right now is  the dizzying doctrine of the Trinity. Can I make you a little dizzy with it? In verse two, which we didn't read, in verse two of this chapter, Jesus is all about saying,  I'm going away.

I'm going away, okay? Then here it says, in verse 16, He says, but the Holy Spirit is coming. And then you go down into verse 21, He says, my father, and I will love you. And in verse 21, 22, and 23, He says, we will come to you. So He says, I'm going away, the Holy Spirit is coming, and therefore I'm coming.

And Jesus is not saying, oh, I'm not really going away, I'm coming to you in the form  of the Holy Spirit. Or on the other hand, as He's saying, oh, I'm going away, and therefore I'm not coming,  He's coming. He is so one with the Holy Spirit that when the Holy Spirit comes into your life, Jesus  comes. And yet He is not so identical to the Holy Spirit that He isn't also already away, and  therefore in heaven. Got that?

Okay? See how easy that was? No, you know, here's, Jesus is saying, there's not three gods, because there are two  one to be three gods. On the other hand, it's not one person in three forms. You know, there he has his father, half, and he has his son, half, and he has this Holy  Spirit hat.

It's not three gods, there are two one for that, but it's not one god in three forms,  there are two three for that. It's one god in three persons. And we're going to, in the next year, we're going to get back to this doctrine. All I can tell you is, in the early days of my Christian faith, it was a millstone  around my neck. It felt like this is so confusing, and today I think it's one of the greatest things.

It's one of the joys I've got when I contemplated it. Once you get to understand it, you see the beauty of it, and I can't go into any further than  that, because we're here not to talk about the Trinity, but the Holy Spirit. But here's what I want you to see, why so important. The Holy Spirit is not an impersonal force. The Holy Spirit is a divine person in the middle of your life.

Why does that matter? Oh, it matters. Because the Bible talks about being filled with the Holy Spirit. Later on, we'll have a whole sermon on that, being filled with the Holy Spirit. But being filled with the Holy Spirit is to experience incredible divine joy and power.

I want that, and I want that for you. So how do you get filled with the Spirit? If you are filled with the Spirit and you think of the Spirit as an impersonal force, you're  going to go about seeking that in a different way than if you understand, you're being  filled with the Spirit and the Spirit is a person. If you try to get filled with an impersonal force, you go about it in a mechanical way. So for example, Eastern thought conceived God, the divine, as an impersonal force.

Eastern thought sees the divine as an impersonal force. And therefore, it's approach to, Eastern thought's approach, is meditation. But the meditation is always emptying the mind of thought, rational thought, emptying the  mind of words. You emptied the mind of it. Why?

Because we're trying to get in touch with the force. And whatever you get into the Bible and you see the word meditation comes up a lot. But Christian meditation, biblical meditation, is not emptying the mind of rational thoughts  and words. Feeling the mind with the words of God is a completely different approach. If you don't, if you think of the Holy Spirit as an it, you're going to be moving in a mechanical  approach.

In fact, I really do see an awful lot of Christian teaching on being filled with the Spirit  that does sort of see the Spirit as a kind of electrical charge. And therefore, the way you get filled with the Spirit is by pushing buttons. You pray in certain ways, you do certain things, you refrain from certain things, you repent  for certain things, and you kind of, you push all the right buttons and you get your  life into some kind of environmental condition. And then in it comes, it, no, no. If the Spirit is a person, then to be filled with a Spirit is like being filled with a person.

How does that work? Well, I know, for example, that when I was young, sometimes my parents would, if there was  a visitor that came into our home for a while, a weekend or something like that. It was a person that my parents really respected. It could have been a visiting, dignitary, visiting speaker, or a member of the family that they  had high regard for. It affected everything.

First of all, for some reason the house looked beautiful. Suddenly we made our living space just physically look beautiful. But then secondly, everybody was on their best behavior, and it wasn't a sham. The point is the little things that used to just rub us the wrong way just didn't matter,  because this person was here. And we hung on this person's words to be filled with a Spirit is to have your life transformed  by an acute consciousness of the glorious person that lives permanently within the walls  of your life.

I've told you this before, I remember once counseling a man who had had an affair and blew  up his life, and he had been cheating on his wife. But he told me that whenever he would bring, if his wife was a wife, he would bring his  mistress into the home. He had a turnover all the pay, and I tell you this recently, any picture of his wife,  any picture of himself and his wife or any picture of his wife, he had a take down  or turnover. Because neither he nor the mistress could bear even the photograph face of his wife. Because even the presence of the picture would affect his behavior.

Do you know who's living in your life? Are you melted by spiritual understanding, by an acute consciousness of the glorious  person that's there to change the way in which you live? Just the awareness of it fills you with a sense of his presence, and it would bring integrity  to your life. You're doing right now that you wouldn't do if you were aware of him being there. If you turn the pictures back over and you say, oh, I might think about this.

Of course, it also means to hang on his words. Be filled with the Spirit is very different than to be filled with a force, which leads  us to the second point. The Holy Spirit is a personal divine resident of the Christian heart. Secondly, what does the Holy Spirit do? There are two words here that tell us what he does and they're great.

He is a Spirit of Truth, verse 17, and he is a counselor. He's a Spirit of Truth and a counselor. So first, he is the Spirit of Truth. What does this mean? At one level, we know this, that the Holy Spirit essentially authored the Bible.

The Holy Spirit literally is the author of the Bible. So for example, in 2 Peter 1, it says this, no prophecy of Scripture came about by the  prophet's own interpretation. For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were  carried along by the Holy Spirit. And then here, this is John 6, verse 63, where Jesus says, the words I speak to you are  spirit and life. In other words, the words of Jesus that you see in the Bible were produced by the Spirit  and if you embrace them and receive them and understand them, they give you eternal  life.

So the Holy Spirit, at one level, is the author of the Scripture. In fact, and see, this goes back to this idea of what it means to be filled with the Spirit  if the Spirit's a person as opposed to a force. If you go to Ephesians 5.18, the famous passage in which Paul says, be filled with the Spirit  and then he makes a list of the traits of a Spirit-filled life which we won't go into  right now. We have a sermon coming up on that later. Be filled with the Spirit, Ephesians 5.18, and then there's a list.

If you go to another one of his letters, Colossians, and if you go to chapter 3, and Paul  wrote these letters to different churches, but he often said similar things because he  was writing to churches and he got the same basic truths across. If you go to Colossians 3.16, it says, be filled with the Word. It says, be filled with the Word. And then it makes a list of the Word-filled life. He says, let the Word dwell richly in you, which is the same as be filled with the Word.

Then it gives a list of traits, and they're the same traits. This Paul said in Ephesians 5.18, where the traits of a Spirit-filled life, you know what  this means? See, to be filled with a person, to be dominated by a person, is to hang on that person's  every word. It means to be dominated and saturated by the Scripture. To let it dwell in your richly is not the same thing as knowing it as information, so take  it in.

It's to make it part of yourself, or another way to put it is this. You can look at glasses, but that's really not why I spent so much money on these. I did not go to the optician and spend hundreds of dollars on this, just so I could sit them  down and say, hey honey, come look at my glasses, that doesn't work that way. You put them on and you look at everything else through them. And the Scripture, it's one thing to look at the Scripture, and to say, I'm going to  learn the facts.

It's another thing to let it dwell in your richly. It's another thing to be saturated by it. It's another thing to so take it in that you look at everything else through it. And therefore, to be filled with the Word and to be filled with the Spirit is the same  thing because he's a spirit of truth. In fact, he goes on beyond that, though.

We already referred to it here, looking verse 21, whoever has my commands, that's the  word, and obeys them. He is the one who loves me. He who loves me will be loved by my Father and I too will love him, and I will show myself  to him. Now that's interesting. What does this mean?

Here are some people who obviously believe in Jesus, and who obviously are obeying Jesus  and they're reading the Word of God, and Jesus says, I will come and show myself to them. This is in this passage on the Holy Spirit, I will come and show myself to them. Now, what does that mean? Does they not know who he is? Of course they know who he is.

What is that? What is the Holy Spirit taking the words and making them life, taking the words and making  them power? Here's another place where Paul talks about it, and listen, this is actually one of the  most important verses in the Bible to me personally. This is Ephesians 3, Paul says, I pray, he's praying for his friends. He says, I pray that out of his glorious riches he will strengthen you with power through  his spirit in your inner being so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.

And I pray that you being rooted and established in love may have power to grasp how wide,  and long, and high, and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses  knowledge that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God. He's talking to Christians, and he says, by the power of the Spirit, I'm praying that  through the power of the Spirit Christ may dwell in your hearts, but Christ is already  dwell in their hearts. They wouldn't be Christians. And then he says, I'm praying that by the power of the Spirit, you may grasp. You may have power to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ.

Don't they already know about the love of Christ? Of course they wouldn't be Christians. He says, but I want you to know this love that surpasses knowledge. What's he talking about? Let me just give you an example.

John Kineber's Quiet Time Notebook is a little journal, he wrote. He says, I have, at many times, had the greatest delight in the Holy Scriptures of any book whatsoever. Oftentimes in reading, it every word seems to touch my heart. I seem often to see so much light exhibited by every sentence and have such a refreshing,  ravishing, food communicated from these words that I cannot get along in my reading. I'm often used to dwell long on one sentence to see the wonders contained in it.

The sense I had of divine things as I read the Scripture would often of a sudden,  as it were kindle of a sweet burning in my heart, an order of my soul that I know not how to express. Though he's not doing too bad a job right there. What's he talking about? It's one thing to read the Scripture. It's another thing to have the Holy Spirit come and reveal Jesus Christ to you in it.

It's one thing to know, Christ dwells in your heart, it's another thing to sense it. We talked about this actually last week. It's one thing to know with your head that sugar is sweet, it's another thing to taste it  and have your whole being electrified by it. You not only know it, but you sense it, and that's the job of the Holy Spirit. He is the author, not only of objective truth, because he wrote the Bible,  but of subjective truth, he makes it live in your life.

He makes it live, he makes it vivid and powerful, he makes it life-changing,  and that's the first thing the Holy Spirit does. But believe it or not, that's not all. Because actually, if this is all he did, he still would be a kind of consultant,  or somebody who hired just to come in and give you certain things at certain times. But that's not all he is. He's also a counselor.

I mean, this is the main point of this whole passage. I will ask the Father and He will give you another counselor. Now, if you go to five or six translations,  get out all your different translations, you're going to have five or six different words. And whenever you see English translations with very different words and every translation,  that means that the word that's used here is too rich for one English word to convey  and so the translators are struggling. Some of you may have the Old King James Bible,  and there's a number of other translations that say,  and I will ask the Father and He will give you another comforter.

Now, that's a really sweet word, but it does make the Holy Spirit sound like a quilt. So they don't use that much anymore. But even this word, counselor, is this a camp counselor? Is this a marriage counselor? No.

Actually, they do know one thing, and this is the reason why we don't have a good word to come out with it. Basically, what the commentators know, this word is,  this is the word paracaleo, or paracleic, paracleesis. It's actually a very difficult word to translate. Parameans not to be in front or behind, but to stand alongside. Kaleo means to declare, to call, to argue, actually.

And therefore, the best way to translate this is I'm going to send you another legal advocate. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God. Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365-day devotional, the songs of Jesus,  you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a regular devotional practice,  this book is a wonderful way to start.

And if you already spend time and study in prayer,  then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest emotions  and questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with Him. We'll send you Tim and Kathy Keller's devotional as our thanks for your gift  to help Gospel and Life share the love of Jesus with more people. Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash give. That's gospelandlife.com slash give. The word gets across the idea, but on the one hand, this person is yours.

This person stands in your position, represents you. This person is loyal to you to the end. This is a person who is for you in the strongest sense. But on the other hand, it also means this is a person who argues. This is a person who debates.

This is a person who makes a case. This is a person who defends you against your enemies. There's a soft side that's the sympathy with you and there's a hard side. Now why in the world would Jesus Christ say that the Holy Spirit is your legal advocate? What does that mean?

And here's what I believe it means. The Holy Spirit's job is to defend you against the enemies here on earth,  but especially the enemies inside your own heart. For example, in Romans 8, 15, it says, God has not given us a spirit of fear,  but he's given us the spirit of his son who comes into a heart-crying oba father. You know what that means? Your heart's filled with fears, fears.

And the Holy Spirit comes in and argues and says, no, God loves you. You're a his child. Then one verse later, Romans 8, 16, it says, the Spirit bears witness with our spirit  that we're children of God. We actually talked about this last week, what I didn't bring out is the word bears witness  is a technical Greek word that means the star witness in court. A person bringing testimony, legal testimony in court that basically settles the case.

And so what this is saying is, your heart's filled with doubts. Your heart's filled with doubts. And in comes the Holy Spirit and says, no, there's no reason to doubt. You are his. You are loved.

Or there's this great spot in Hebrews 12, which is all about suffering  and all the troubles that come to us. And in Hebrews 12, it says, have you forgotten the word of  exhortation that argues with you? That's what the Greek word means as children. My son do not make light of the Lord's discipline for he disciplines those he loves. The Hebrews writer is quoting Proverbs 3 and he's saying that the job of the Holy  Scripture is to argue with you when you're cast down.

Suffering has happened to you. Bad things have happened to you. And you feel like, oh, I'm being abandoned. No, according to the book of Hebrews, he says, the Scripture argues with you. How?

As children, the Scripture argues and says, no, you are his child. He has not abandoned you. Good fathers often put their children through paces. And that's what's happening to you right now. Now, what does all this mean?

You know, there's a place in 1 John 3.20 where it says, when our hearts condemn us,  God is greater than our hearts. With a small paraphrase, I'm just going to say, when our hearts condemn us,  the Holy Spirit is greater than our hearts. It's the Holy Spirit's job to argue. Our hearts do not like the idea of grace. We don't really like the gospel, the idea that we're saved by grace.

We want to earn it. We want to merit it. It puts us in control. And because our hearts have got that part there,  we're constantly being buffeted by fears, by doubts. When bad things happen, we say, no, no, he's abandoned us.

I'm not good enough. He can't possibly love me and the Holy Spirit comes in and argues. He makes the case. He takes the gospel and pounds you until you start to relax. But it's not just that the Holy Spirit defends us against accusation.

He also defends us against temptation. In James 4, there's this strange spot where James first says,  do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity toward God? And then it says, don't you realize, and again, they don't know how to translate this. Don't you realize that the spirit of God within you envies you? Because sometimes they translate it lusts unto envy.

They don't know how to translate. You know what it's saying? It's saying don't you realize that when you start to let the world take you away from God  that the Holy Spirit within you longs for your love? The Holy Spirit sees us giving our heart to money, or giving our heart to fame,  or giving our heart to sex, or giving our heart to power instead of to God. And then the Holy Spirit when it sees our hearts tempting us away from God, knowing  this is going to destroy us.

The Holy Spirit acts the way of a loving friend acts toward an addict. What do you do when you love somebody and you see them destroying their lives through addiction? You get them into a corner and you say, you're killing yourself, I'm not going to let you do it. I'm going to confront you, I'm going to oppose you because I love you, I'm not going to let you do it. And you know what, you can almost come to blows over that.

You can have friends who come and tell you you're wrong, you're killing yourself,  I'm not going to let you do it. You can get so angry at them that you can have a fight. But this is what we've got when we have the Holy Spirit in our lives. This is a friend, this is a counselor, this is a legal advocate, this is someone who will not let  you kill yourself. He's a glorious person and Paul says in Philippians 1, the good work God  began in you, he will bring the completion of the day of Jesus Christ.

He's a glorious person  this Holy Spirit and he will not stop until you become the glorious person you should be. He is going to oppose anything in your heart that will scuttle you. And he's not going to let you go. This is a friend whose love has teeth in it. This is a friend who's utterly for you, which means sometimes he's against you for you.

He said, I should have thought twice about inviting this person into my life. No, I just want you to think about the implications. And therefore, yes, it's the job of the Holy Spirit to give you scripture. And then the job of the Holy Spirit to make that scripture real and vibrant and powerful in  your life. But he's not simply doing it, you know, just to give you spiritual experiences.

He's come into your life and he's utterly committed to bringing the good work God began with you  at the new birth to completion in the day of Jesus Christ. And he's not going to let you go. You see, he's a counselor. He's not like a camp counselor. You don't go home.

He's even not like a marriage counselor that you go to see. And then you say, I'm not getting  anything out of it. Okay. He's a permanent legal advocate. He's a permanent friend who's  willing to do interventions on you all the time.

He's for you, para. But he sometimes can be  against you for you. And that's the wonder of having the Holy Spirit in your life. Now,  lastly, very importantly, how can you be, well, I'm not going to say be full of the Spirit. We're going to go to that later.

But how can you be sure that you're receiving the benefits  that the Holy Spirit can offer you? And I think there's two answers in this text. We're just  sticking with the text. There's certainly more to much more to say about the Holy Spirit than we  have here. But we're going to stick with the text.

And here's the first thing. The key to the power of  the Holy Spirit operating in your life and making you what you should be and can be is understanding  the first advocate. See, when Jesus says, I'm going to send you another counselor. He's talking  about himself. Who's the first counselor?

Him. He's the first counselor. And this word,  parapleg, parapleg, legal advocate is used of Jesus, too, by the same author, John, not in the book  of John, but in the first epistle of John, where he says this. Now, this is the new international  translation. He says, I write this to you.

This is first John 21. I write this to you so that you will  not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense. Jesus  Christ the righteous. He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins.

Now, that's how the new international  version renders it. We have one who speaks to the Father in our defense. Actually, it just says  we have an advocate with the Father. We have a parapleg we have an advocate with the Father. And when the Bible says that when we sin, we have an advocate with the Father.

If we believe in  Jesus Christ, we have an advocate with the Father. Here's what the Bible is assuming. Number one,  it assumes that there is a bar of justice. There is a court before which all of us stand accused. That we're condemned.

And after 35 years, in fact, I realize that, you know, actually the first  sermon I ever preached at my very first church 35 years ago was on 4th of July Sunday. And my 35  years of pastoral work, I've seen lots and lots of people who tried desperately to get out from  under this idea that they're moral failures, this idea that they're condemned. One of the best  ways to do it is to move New York City where you're going to be told what's right or wrong. That's  you create that yourself. You decide what is right or wrong for you.

You don't let somebody else  is moral. You decide what is right or wrong for you. And for, you know, for a number of years,  you say, see, I don't have to feel guilty. I decide what is right or wrong for me. Until you realize  there's not a single person on the face of the earth that even lives up to the standards that you  have decided or right or wrong.

And the standards that you apply to everybody else. And I don't care  what happens. It could be you're successful in the beginning of your life and then realizes  life goes on that you've neglected your relationships and now you're lonely. Well, you're unsuccessful  early in life and you feel like a failure because of that or you just suffering hits you and whenever  suffering hits you, you realize you forces you to admit your moral flaws. Everybody in the end has  a sense that they're condemned.

Everybody knows they're a moral failure. It sleeps very deep  this sense in people for a long time and it might be sleeping deep in you. But there is a bar of justice. There is a court before which we all stand accused,  0.1, 0.2. The second thing that this passage assumes is that when you believe in Jesus Christ,  Jesus Christ stands before that just court of justice representing you,  representing you, interceding for you, making his case for you.

Now when I was a new Christian,  I read that spot. There's a place in Romans 8 where it says Jesus Christ ever lives to intercede. It's in Hebrews 7. It's in Romans 8 where it says Jesus Christ makes intercession for us before  the Father. And that was kind of a comfort for me because in my mind, what it meant was every time I  sinned, Jesus walked up and said, don't abandon him because, you know, be merciful or something like  that.

You know, he, I know he promised not to do that anymore and he did it anymore. Let's  give him one more chance. I guess I thought that's what he was doing. And that wasn't very comforting  to me because, you know, I always wonder how long can Jesus keep that up? You know, when is he  finally going to say, I'm not going to the Father one more time for this guy?

Or when's the Father  going to say, I'm sorry, you know, what this has been, you know, this has been five years now,  you know, he says, it didn't comfort me until I read a, actually, a, a sermon outline by a  man named Charles Hodge who was a, one of the, one of the professors at Princeton Theological Seminary  in the 19th century, like in the 1830s and 1840s. And he gave a chapel talk on Jesus Christ as the  advocate and something to change, changed my life long ago. He says, you know what? Jesus Christ  is your advocate. He is your legal representative before the, before the bar, before the, before the  court.

And one of the things you have to realize, he's not up there just pleading for mercy. That is  not what a legal advocate does. A legal advocate makes a case and he makes a case based on the law. And he's up there securing your status as not being condemned because of the law. He's not  up there pleading for mercy.

He's making a case. I said, what? And then this is what Charles Hodge  says is something like what we think. The Bible is trying to convey when it talks about Jesus  our legal advocate. It's almost as if, and I know this is, it's almost as if Jesus is saying, Father,  you are just and sin demands payment.

And this brother or sister of mine has sinned. He's not loved guy with all his heart, soul, strength of mine. He hasn't loved his neighbors  himself. He is sinned and his sin must be paid for. But Father, here's the payment.

Look at my  broken body. Look at my poor outblood. I have paid for it. And it would be unjust  to get two payments for the same sin. I've paid for it.

And therefore, I'm not just pleading for  mercy. I demand acquittal for my brother because I have paid for his sin. And therefore he cannot  pay for his sin. And therefore, there cannot be any condemnation of him. I demand acquittal.

It's  justice that he's pleading for. See, that's what Charles Hodge was saying. And when I realize that,  I hope you can come with me. I'm trying to get across in three minutes with what was kind of a watershed  for me. See, I realize all of the religion sort of see salvation as the scales.

You know, the justice  scales, you know, the blind lady with the scales, that's justice. And all I thought was that the moral  law of God, the divine justice was on one side of the scale. And I had to put in a ton of good works  on the other side just so it didn't kill me. See, the justice of God was against me. You better  be good.

You better be good. And I had to, you know, push up everything I possibly could out of my  own life. All the good deeds and all the prayers and going to church and everything. Get it on  that other scale. Otherwise, just a balance out of otherwise, I'm just cooked.

And I realize that  when you believe in Jesus Christ as your Savior, and when He becomes your legal advocate, it means  that justice of God is on your side. It would be unjust for God to take two payments for the same  sin. And your sins have been paid for. And therefore, the very justice of God, the omnipotent,  infallible, infinite justice of God, demands that there is no condemnation for you. Now, if we've  got that advocate up there doing that, what is the Holy Spirit doing down here?

The Holy Spirit  is our advocate on earth. Jesus Christ is our advocate in heaven. What the Holy Spirit is doing  is He's taking the advocacy in heaven and applying it here on earth against the enemies in your own  heart. He's pounding into you. He's dealing with your temptations.

He's dealing with your pride. He's dealing with your fears. He's dealing with your accusations. And he's saying, look at what  Jesus has done. The Holy Spirit, though, is not an advocate that points to himself.

J.I. Packer beautifully puts it. It's in John chapter 16 where it actually says, Jesus says,  the Holy Spirit will speak of me. He will glorify me. He will not speak of himself.

He will speak of  me. And J.I. Packer, who is an Anglican minister, one day was, he was preaching a sermon on the Holy  Spirit and he was looking for a good illustration on the way to preach. He saw a floodlight. He was kind of dark at night.

And he saw a floodlight lighting up an old building which in the  daytime didn't look very good, but at night looked beautiful. And he suddenly realized he couldn't  even tell where the floodlight was. He says, I couldn't even tell because the job of the floodlight  is not to call attention to itself. The job of the floodlight is to throw into relief the beauty  and the magnificence of the thing that is flooding. And he says, that's the Holy Spirit.

The Holy  Spirit's job is not to say, look at me. Get my power. Get my joy. The Holy Spirit's job is to say,  look at Jesus. Look at the beauty of what he's done.

Look at him standing up there. Look at his  advocacy for you. Do you not see that there's no danger? There is no failure. There is no accusation.

There is nothing that can overturn you. That can cast you down. Nothing. The Holy Spirit's job  is to pull. He's an advocate on earth pointing to our advocate in heaven, making the work of the  advocate in heaven so beautiful to your life that it changes it.

All right, look, two things. Number one, here's two ways I would like you to change your life on the basis of what I've  already said, even if you say, I've already got some things to change. All right, then these two  things. Would you please notice the magnificence of divine selflessness,  the magnificence of divine selflessness? Here's Jesus Christ, emptying self of His glory  in order to become a servant and die on the cross for our sins.

And now, here's the Holy Spirit,  not speaking of His own glory, but glorifying Jesus. There must be something deep in the heart of  God that is other oriented. There's a selflessness in God. There's something in God that says,  my life for yours. There's something in God that says, I'm here to serve you.

Here's Jesus emptying self of His glory. Here's the Holy Spirit only showing us Jesus glory. Are you always promoting yourself? Are you always upset because people aren't giving you your  due? Do you feel like you're not getting credit?

Do you find yourself always getting insulted? How  dare people talk to me like that or about me like that? Are you doing what a lot of New Yorkers  are doing, spending all their time just trying to get up the ladder and basically only dealing with  people if they serve you, serve your interest, help you with your agenda? If you want to be like the  divine person who comes and lives in the heart of a Christian, you have to be a person who is  characterized by the magnificence of divine selflessness. Get rid of your pride.

Stop promoting yourself  all the time. Be like the one who lives within you. But here's the second thing. Are you on the  other hand? Do you feel like an imposter?

Are you struggling with rejection? In New York, there's  always an audition. There's always a job interview. There's always, and we're always struggling with  rejection here. Are some of you struggling on off a lot?

Do you feel like a failure in many ways? Are you afraid to have any of the people around you realize how much you lack confidence? How much you right now almost load yourself? You need an advocate and you got one in heaven. You got one on earth.

You really got everything you need. Avail yourself of him. Let's pray. Our Father, we thank You for the gift of the Holy Spirit. We thank You for sending another  counselor into our lives.

Oh, how we do. Thank You for that. And we pray that You would help us  to be filled with the Spirit. We pray that You would help us to receive His counseling. We pray  that You would help us to cooperate with Him as He advocates for us.

And we ask that You would  help us to do this as an entire church so we truly would be a Spirit-filled church. The world will  do this and You'll be grateful. You'll be glad for us. You'll be, we'll be grateful to You and You'll  be glorified in us. And that's what we want.

We pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.

### 引言：圣灵是谁？

圣灵是谁？为什么圣灵的工作对基督徒的生活如此重要？圣经告诉我们，圣灵不仅仅是一个模糊的力量，而是一个在基督徒生活中以深刻方式工作的位格。今天，Tim Keller 探讨圣灵如何呼召我们信仰，将我们联合在一起，装备我们以恩赐，并塑造我们更像基督。

今天早上的经文来自约翰福音第十四章第16-26节。

> 我要求父，父就另外赐给你们一位保惠师，叫他永远与你们同在，就是真理的圣灵。世人不能接受他，因为不见他，也不认识他；你们却认识他，因为他常与你们同在，也要在你们里面。我不撇下你们为孤儿，我必到你们这里来。还有不多的时候，世人不再看见我，你们却看见我，因为我活着，你们也要活着。到那日，你们就知道我在父里面，你们在我里面，我也在你们里面。有了我的命令又遵守的，这人就是爱我的；爱我的必蒙我父爱他，我也要爱他，并且要向他显现。犹大（不是加略人犹大）问耶稣说，主啊，为什么要向我们显现，不向世人显现呢？耶稣回答说，人若爱我，就必遵守我的道；我父也必爱他，并且我们要到他那里去，与他同住。不爱我的人就不遵守我的道；你们所听见的道不是我的，乃是差我来之父的道。我还与你们同住的时候，已将这些话对你们说了。但保惠师，就是父因我的名所要差来的圣灵，他要将一切的事指教你们，并且要叫你们想起我对你们所说的一切话。

这是主的话。

### 圣灵的位格

首先，他是谁？圣灵是谁？顺便说一下，我已经通过选择我的代词给了你一点答案。**圣灵是基督徒心中的个人神圣居民。**

- 圣灵是个人。耶稣称圣灵为他，而不是我们倾向于称之为的它，不是能量或力量，而是他。
- 圣灵是神。耶稣说，他是另一位保惠师，我是保惠师，他是另一位。

### 圣灵的工作

圣灵是真理的灵和保惠师。

- **真理的灵：** 圣灵是圣经的作者。你在圣经中看到的耶稣的话是由圣灵产生的。
- **保惠师：** 圣灵是你的法律辩护者。圣灵的工作是保护你免受地上的敌人，尤其是你自己内心的敌人。

### 接受圣灵

你如何确保你正在接受圣灵可以提供的好处？

- **理解第一位保惠师：** 耶稣基督是我们在天上的辩护者。圣灵是我们在地上的辩护者。
- **圣灵的角色：** 圣灵的工作是拉动。他是地上的辩护者，指向我们在天上的辩护者，使天上辩护者的工作在你的生活中如此美丽，以至于改变了它。

让我们祷告。

我们的父，我们感谢你赐予圣灵的礼物。我们感谢你将另一位保惠师送入我们的生活。哦，我们多么感谢你。我们祈求你帮助我们被圣灵充满。我们祈求你帮助我们接受他的辅导。我们祈求你帮助我们配合他为我们辩护。我们请求你帮助我们作为整个教会这样做，以便我们真正成为一个被圣灵充满的教会。世界将这样做，你会为我们感到高兴。我们会感激你，你会在我们中得到荣耀。这就是我们想要的。我们奉耶稣的名祷告。阿门。

## Chinese Transcript / 中文

今天，提姆·凯勒要带领我们思想圣灵如何呼召我们信主、把我们联合在一起、赐给我们恩赐，并塑造我们更像基督。今天早上的经文出自《约翰福音》十四章16–26节。“我要求父，父就另外赐给你们一位保惠师，叫他永远与你们同在，就是那真理的灵。世人不能接受他，因为不见他、也不认识他，你们却认识他，因为他常与你们同在，也要在你们里面。我不撇下你们为孤儿，我必到你们这里来。

“还有不多的时候，世人不再看见我，你们却看见我；因为我活着，你们也要活着。到那日，你们就知道我在父里面，你们在我里面，我也在你们里面。有了我的命令又遵守的，这人就是爱我的；爱我的，必蒙我父爱他，我也要爱他，并且要向他显现。”

那时犹大——不是加略人犹大——问他说：“主啊，为什么要向我们显现，不向世人显现呢？”

耶稣回答说：“人若爱我，就必遵守我的道；我父也必爱他，并且我们要到他那里去，与他同住。不爱我的人就不遵守我的道；你们所听见的道不是我的，乃是差我来之父的道。我还与你们同住的时候，已经对你们说了这些话。但那保惠师，就是父因我的名所要差来的圣灵，他要将一切的事指教你们，并且要叫你们想起我对你们所说的一切话。”

这是主的话。

夏天的时候，因为大家要放假，所以讲台上会有好几位不同的讲员。为了保持合一、确保我们一同前行，我们会选定一个共同的主题。从现在一直到九月中旬，我们要来看圣经关于圣灵的教导，也就是圣灵的教义。

就我自己的观察，世界上有许多教会几乎只谈属灵经历；也有许多教会对这个题目敬而远之，只愿意谈教义、谈真理、谈“认识正确的东西”。但我认为，医治这种失衡的良药，就是圣灵的教义。因为你越深入研究，就越会发现“圣灵”和“真理”是相辅相成、不可分割的。这也是我们接下来几周要做的事情。

今天这篇是导论性的讲道。让我们来看看，这段伟大的经文告诉我们：圣灵是谁；他做什么；以及我们如何领受他所赐的。谁是圣灵，他做什么，我们如何领受他所赐的——这是一个很高层次、很基础的入门，但却非常美好。

首先，圣灵是谁？谁是圣灵？顺带一提，我刚才其实已经透过我所用的代词给了你一点答案。圣灵是住在基督徒心中的那位位格性的、神圣的内住者。圣灵是住在基督徒心中的那位位格性的神。

先说“位格性”。你有没有注意到，耶稣称呼圣灵从来不是“它”（it）——我们常这么说——也不是某种能量或力量，而是“他”（He）。你看经文，一上来就说：“世人不能接受他……”——他，是一位位格。在《以弗所书》4章30节说，圣灵会忧伤；你可以叫圣灵担忧。在《希伯来书》10章29节说，你可以惹圣灵恼怒；在《罗马书》15章则说，圣灵会爱。圣灵会爱、会忧伤、会愤怒——这些感受，一个非位格的力量是不会有的；那是一位“人位”。

但他不只是位格，他也是神。举个例子，就在这一段经文里说：“我要求父，父就另外赐给你们一位保惠师。”我们待会儿会谈“保惠师”这个词。耶稣说：“他是另一位保惠师；我是保惠师，他是另一位。”

现在，希腊文里有两个“另一个”的说法。一个是“这个，还有另一个”；另外一个是“这个，和另一个不一样的那个”。其中一个词是 heteros，意思是“与前者相对、不同的”；另一个词是 allos，意思是“与前者同类、相似的”。

你要明白耶稣在这里说的话有多大胆，因为耶稣对自己曾经做过极大的宣告。比如在《约翰福音》8章，他说：“还没有亚伯拉罕，就有了我。”他把神在燃烧的荆棘中向摩西启示的名字拿过来，说：“那就是我——我是（I AM）。”

耶稣宣称自己能赦免一切的罪。你知道这意味着什么吗？当他说自己能赦免一切的罪，那就意味着所有的罪都是得罪他的——因为你只能赦免那些得罪你的罪。耶稣说他要审判世界。

所以，耶稣一再在说：“我与神同等。”而现在，他竟然大胆地说：“我要差遣给你们的那一位，和我一样。”圣灵是一位位格，圣灵是神。于是我们马上就进入令人眩晕的“三一论”当中了。

我能不能让你在这个教义上稍微“晕”一下？在本章第二节（我们没有读出来）耶稣一直在说：“我要离开了，我要走了。”接着在16节他说：“但圣灵要来。”然后到了21、22、23节，他又说：“我父要来，我也要来，我们要到你们那里去。”

所以他说：“我要离开”；接着说：“圣灵要来”；然后又说：“因此，我要来。”耶稣不是在说：“哦，其实我并没有真的走，我是以圣灵的形式回来的。”他也不是在说：“我既然走了，我就真的不在那儿，是他在这儿。”他与圣灵如此合一，以至于当圣灵进入你生命的时候，就是耶稣进入你的生命；同时，他又不像圣灵那样完全相同，以至于他不能同时在天上、已经离开你。

明白了吗？很简单，对吧？

当然没那么简单。耶稣在说：不是三个神——那样会太“多神论”；但也不是一位神、三个“面具”，好像神一会儿戴“父”的帽子，一会儿戴“子”的帽子，一会儿戴“圣灵”的帽子。不是三个神——那样太多；也不是一位神、三种形态——那样又太少。乃是一位神、三个位格。将来一年我们还会再回到这个教义上来。

我只能这么说：在我刚信主的早年，这个教义就像一块压在我脖子上的磨石，觉得太混乱了；而今天，我认为它是最伟大的真理之一。当我思想它的时候，充满了喜乐。当你慢慢理解，你就会看见它的美丽。今天我没办法展开太多，因为我们这篇讲道不是专门讲三一，而是讲圣灵。

不过我希望你看到一件事：为什么这很重要。圣灵不是一股非位格的力量，圣灵是在你生命正中央的那位神圣位格。为什么这很重要？哦，这非常重要。因为圣经谈“被圣灵充满”。之后我们会用一整篇讲道来谈什么是被圣灵充满。被圣灵充满，就是经历难以置信的神圣喜乐和能力。我想要这个，也希望你有这个。

那么，你如何被圣灵充满呢？如果你被圣灵充满，却把圣灵看成一股非位格的力量，你寻求它的方式会跟你知道圣灵是一位位格时完全不同。如果你试图被一股非位格的力量“充满”，你会用一种机械式的方式去追求。举个例子，在东方思想中，“神圣”“神性”被理解为一种非位格的力量。所以东方灵修的方式是“默想”，但这种“默想”就是把心思从理性、从文字中抽离，把一切思想清空。你为什么要这样做？因为你想要“接上那股力量”。

而当你回到圣经，会看到“默想”这个词也常常出现。但基督徒、圣经里的“默想”，不是把理性和话语从脑中清空，而是把神的话语充满在心思里——那完全是另一套方法。

如果你把圣灵当成一个“它”，你就会走向一种机械化的追求方式。事实上，我确实看到相当多关于“被圣灵充满”的基督教教导，多少都把圣灵当成某种“电流”。因此，被圣灵充满的方式仿佛就是按按钮：你用某些方式祷告、做某些事、远离某些事情、为某些罪悔改；你按对了一系列按钮，让自己的生命进入某种“合适的环境”，然后“它”就会进来——那个“它”。不，不是这样的。

如果圣灵是一位位格，那么被圣灵充满就比较像“被某个人充满”。那是什么意思呢？

我记得我年轻的时候，有时父母会接待一位客人来家里住一段时间，也许是周末之类的，那是他们非常敬重的人，可能是一位来访的讲员，或者是家族中他们极为看重的亲戚。那会影响家里的一切。首先，房子不知怎么地，就突然变得漂亮起来。我们会把居住空间打理得非常美观。其次，大家都会拿出“最好的一面”，而那并不是虚伪。那些平时让我们彼此不爽的小事情，现在似乎都不再重要了，因为那个人在这里。我们会紧紧抓住那位客人说的每一句话。

被圣灵充满，就是因为对住在你生命“墙内”的那位荣耀位格有一种极其清醒、强烈的意识，而让你的生命被翻转。你对他的觉察，使你被他的同在所充满，从而改变你生活的方式。你现在正在做的一些事情，如果你真意识到他在这里，你就不会做。如果你把“照片翻回来”，重新想一想，你的行为就会改变。

当然，这也意味着你会抓住他的话语不放。被圣灵充满，与其说是被某种“力量”充满，不如说是被一位“人位”充满——这就引出第二点。圣灵是住在基督徒心中的那位位格性的神圣内住者。第二，他做什么？这里有两个词形容他所做的工作，非常重要：他是真理的灵（17节），也是保惠师。他是真理的灵，也是保惠师。

那么，首先，他是真理的灵。这是什么意思？在一个层面上，我们都知道：圣灵基本上是圣经的作者。圣灵可以说是圣经真正的作者。比如在《彼得后书》1章里说：“因为预言从来没有出于人意的，乃是人被圣灵感动，说出神的话来。”又比如在《约翰福音》6章63节，耶稣说：“我对你们所说的话就是灵，就是生命。”换句话说，你在圣经里所看到的耶稣的话，是由圣灵所默示、所产生的；而当你领受、明白这些话，它们就把永生赐给你。

所以，在一个层面上，圣灵是圣经的作者。事实上，这又回到刚才所说：如果圣灵是一位位格，而不是一股力量，那被圣灵充满就与被圣经的话语充满有直接的关系。如果你翻到《以弗所书》5章18节，那段著名的经文里，保罗说：“要被圣灵充满”，然后接着列出一串“被圣灵充满的生命”的特征。我们以后会专门用一篇讲道来讲这段，就先不展开了。

如果你再翻到他另一卷书信《歌罗西书》，到三章，你会发现保罗虽然写给不同的教会，但常常用类似的话。所以在《歌罗西书》3章16节那里，他说的却是：“要让基督的道丰丰富富地住在你们心里。”接着又列出一串特征，也就是所谓“被道充满的生命”。你会发现，这些特征几乎和《以弗所书》5章18节“被圣灵充满的生命”的特征一模一样。

这意味着什么？意味着“被一位位格所充满”，“被某个人支配”，就是“抓住这个人说的每一句话”。换句话说，就是被圣经的话语所支配、所浸透。让神的话“丰丰富富地住在你里面”，不只是把它当作信息来记忆；而是让它成为你的一部分。

换个方式说。你可以拿着一副眼镜看——但这不是我花几百块钱买它的原因。我不是买来摆在桌子上对太太说：“嘿，亲爱的，来看看我的眼镜，多好看。”不是这么用的。你是把它戴上，然后透过它来看其他一切东西。

圣经也是如此。“看圣经”是一回事；“让圣经的话住在你里面，让你透过它来解读所有其他事物”又是另一回事。让圣经浸透你、让你被它饱和、让你把它吞进去，直到你用它来看待一切——那才叫“让道住在你里面”。所以，“被圣灵充满”和“被道充满”其实是一回事，因为他是真理的灵。

不过，他做的事不止于此。我们刚刚已经提到21节：“有了我的命令（就是道）又遵守的，这人就是爱我的；爱我的，必蒙我父爱他，我也要爱他，并且要向他显现。”这很有意思。这里说的一群人，显然已经信了耶稣、也在遵行耶稣的话、在读神的话。耶稣却说：“我要向他们显现。”——这段话是在讲圣灵的时候说的，“我要向他显现”。这是什么意思？难道他们还不知道耶稣是谁吗？当然知道，不然他们也不是基督徒。

这是什么意思？这指的就是圣灵的工作：他把话语变成生命；他把道变成能力。保罗在《以弗所书》3章也谈到同样的事——对我个人来说，那是整本圣经里最重要的经文之一。他说：“我求他按着他丰盛的荣耀，借着他的灵，叫你们心里的力量刚强起来，使基督因你们的信，住在你们心里。”

注意，他在为一群朋友祷告，他们已经是基督徒。接着说：“又叫你们在爱中生根建基，能以和众圣徒一同明白基督的爱是何等长阔高深，并知道这爱是过于人所能测度的，便叫神一切所充满的充满了你们。”

他在对基督徒说话，却祷告说：“藉着圣灵的能力，使基督住在你们心里。”但基督已经住在他们心里了，不然他们就不是基督徒。他又说：“我祷告，叫你们能明白基督的爱是何等长阔高深。”难道他们还不知道基督的爱吗？当然知道，不然也不会信主。他又说：“你们要知道这爱是过于人所能测度的。”这到底在说什么？

让我举一个例子。约拿单·爱德华曾写过一本《灵修笔记》，里面有这样一段记载：“我常常从圣经里获得，比任何书籍更大的喜乐。许多时候，我在读经时，几乎每一个字都能触动我的心。我好像常常看见每一句中都有许多光照，感到一种清新、令人陶醉的滋味，从这些话语中源源不断地流入我的心里，以致我根本读不下去。我常常停在一句经文上许久，只为看见其中所包含的奇妙。那时，我心中对属天事物的感觉，常常会忽然像火焰一样被点燃，心灵里有一种甜蜜炽热的感受，我实在不知道该如何表达。”——他其实已经表达得相当好了。

他在讲什么？他讲的是：读经是一回事，圣灵进到经文里，把基督向你显明出来又是另一回事。知道“基督住在你心里”是一回事，真切感觉到、尝到这位基督的同在又是另一回事。我们上周就谈过：用头脑知道“糖是甜的”是一回事，真正尝到糖，让你的全人被那种甜“电到”，又是另一回事。你不只是知道它甜，而且亲身感受到它的甜——这就是圣灵的工作。

圣灵不仅是客观真理的作者（因为他默示了圣经），他也是主观真理的作者：他使真理在你生命里活起来、变得生动有力、带来改变。这是圣灵做的第一件事。但相信也好，不信也罢，他做的还不止这些。

如果圣灵只做这些，他充其量像一个顾问，像一个被雇来不时给你一些东西的“咨询师”。但他不止如此，他还是“保惠师”。这其实是这段经文的核心：“我要求父，父就另外赐给你们一位保惠师。”

如果你去找五六种圣经译本，把这节经文一一对照，你会发现这里翻出来的中文或英文词各不相同。这通常意味着：原文的这个词太丰富，不是一个单一的英文或中文词可以完全表达，所以译者都在挣扎。有些人用的是传统的“保惠师”，有些旧的英文译本用“安慰者”（Comforter），这的确是个很温柔的词，但也让圣灵听起来像一条棉被，所以现在用得少了。也有人译成“辅导者”“帮助者”“劝慰者”，等等。

不过，我们至少知道一点：这个词在原文里是 paraklētos，来自 parakaleō 或 paraklēsis，是一个很难翻译的词。para 意味着“在旁边”，不是在前面、也不是在后面，而是“站在一起”；kaleō 有“呼召、陈述、辩护”的意思。因此，最贴切的翻译其实是“法律上的辩护者”“代言人”，也就是一位“替你说话的律师”。

这个词传达出这样的意涵：一方面，这个人站在你的立场上，代表你，说话完全偏向你；他对你忠心到底，彻底站在你这边，是那种最强烈意义上的“为你而活”的那一位。另一方面，这个词也意味着：他是一位会辩论、会争辩、会讲道理的人；他要替你辩护，对抗仇敌。有柔软的一面——和你一同哀哭、同情你；也有刚硬的一面——勇敢指出问题，保护你。

那么，为什么耶稣会说，圣灵是你的“法律代言人”“辩护律师”呢？这是什么意思？我认为意思是：圣灵的工作之一，是替你抵挡地上的仇敌，尤其是你心里头的那些仇敌。

举例来说，《罗马书》8章15节说：“你们所受的，并不是奴仆的心，仍旧害怕，所受的乃是儿子的心，因此我们呼叫：‘阿爸！父！’”这是什么意思？意思就是，你的心里充满恐惧——各种恐惧。而圣灵进来，对你说：“不，你是神的儿女，神爱你。”

紧接着下一节（罗8:16）说：“圣灵与我们的心同证我们是神的儿女。”这里“同证”的那个字，在希腊文里是个技术词，指的是法庭上的“关键证人”，也就是那个出庭作证、扭转局势的见证人。也就是说，你的心被疑惑充满，怀疑自己；圣灵进来，说：“不，你没有理由怀疑，你是属他的，你被爱。”

在《希伯来书》12章，那整段都是在谈受苦、谈临到我们的困难。12章里有一处说：“你们又忘了那勉励你们，如同劝儿女的话。”这里的“勉励”“劝”这个词，在原文其实有“对你辩论、同你讲道理”的意思。作者引用的是《箴言》3章，说神的话的功能之一，就是在你沮丧时，与你“辩论”。

你遭遇苦难、糟糕的事情临到你，你就觉得：“哦，神抛弃我了，我完了，我一定不够好，神不可能爱我。”圣经的话，透过圣灵，对你说：“不，你是他的孩子，他没有抛弃你。好父亲常常会让儿女经历一些训练，如今你正经历的就是如此。”

这都意味着什么？《约翰一书》3章20节说：“我们的心若责备我们，神比我们的心大。”我稍微改写一下：当我们心里责备我们的时候，圣灵比我们的心更大。圣灵的工作，就是与你的心“争辩”。我们的内心其实并不喜欢“恩典”这个观念；我们不太喜欢福音——那种“你是靠恩典得救”的观念。我们偏好赚取、偏好凭功劳，因为那让我们掌控一切。正因如此，我们的心常常被恐惧、疑惑所摇晃。

当坏事发生，我们很快就说：“神抛弃我了，我不够好，他一定不再爱我。”而圣灵进来，与我们争辩。他不断把福音拿出来，一遍又一遍敲进我们的心里，直到我们开始放松、开始安息为止。

但圣灵不仅替我们抵挡“控告”，他也替我们抵挡“试探”。在《雅各书》4章，有一段很奇特的话：雅各先说：“岂不知与世俗为友，就是与神为敌吗？”然后说：“你们想经上所说是徒然的吗？神所赐住在我们里面的灵，是恋爱至于嫉妒吗？”这句经文译者也很挣扎，有人译成“灵恋爱我们，甚至嫉妒”；有人译成“灵向我们所怀的心是恋慕”；意思大致是：圣灵对你有一种强烈的“嫉妒式的爱”。

当你把心交给世界、交给金钱、名声、性、权力，而不是交给神的时候，圣灵看见你被自己的私欲带离神、最终要毁掉自己，他就像一个深爱成瘾者的朋友一样，会站出来对你说：“你在毁了自己，我不会袖手旁观。我爱你，所以我要当面对质你、反对你。”你甚至可能因为他的话“气得想和他翻脸”，但他仍然坚持——因为他爱你。

这就是圣灵在你生命里的样子。他是一位朋友、一位保惠师、一位法律代言人，不会任凭你自我毁灭。他是一位荣耀的位格；保罗在《腓立比书》1章说：“那在你们心里动了善工的，必成全这工，直到耶稣基督的日子。”圣灵就是那位不会停手、直到你成了你本该成为的那位荣耀之人的那一位。他会抵挡你心里一切要毁掉你的东西，他不会放弃你。这是一位“带着牙齿的爱”的朋友——因为他完全站在你这边，所以有时也会“反对你，为了你”。

所以，有些人会说：“早知道这样，我也许要三思而后行，才让这位住进我的生命里。”但我要你想一想其中的含义：是的，圣灵的确要借着圣经把真理赐给你，也要让这些真理在你生命里变得鲜活、有力、富有生命。但他不只是为着给你一些“属灵经历”而这么做，他是来到你生命里，彻底委身于一件事：要把神在你重生那一刻所动的善工，一路带到耶稣基督的日子——直到完工，他才罢休。

他不会放过你。你看，他是保惠师——但不是夏令营的辅导员，你不会“营会结束就各回各家”。他也不只是像你预约的心理咨询师，你觉得“好像没什么收获，我不想去了”，就可以终止关系。他是一位永远的法律辩护人，一位不会离开的朋友，会不断在你身上做属灵“介入”，对你进行一次又一次的“干预”。他“para”（站在你旁边），完全为你，但有时也会为了你、而“反对你”。这就是圣灵在你生命中那奇妙的工作。

好，最后一个问题，而且非常重要：怎样才可以确保自己正在领受圣灵所要给我们的这一切益处？在这段经文里，我认为至少有两个答案。我们先只根据这段经文来谈，当然关于圣灵还有许多可以说的。

第一，圣灵在你生命中运行的大能，使你成为本该成为的人，它的关键在于——你要明白“第一位保惠师”。当耶稣说“我要差另一位保惠师来”时，那“第一位保惠师”是谁？就是他自己。他是第一位保惠师。这个“paraklētos”这个词，也同样用在耶稣身上——同一个作者约翰，在他的第一封书信里，而不是在《约翰福音》中，这样说（《约翰一书》2:1）：

“若有人犯罪，在父那里我们有一位中保，就是那义者耶稣基督。他为我们的罪作了挽回祭。”——新译本里“中保”或“在父面前为我们说情的”，原文就是“辩护者”“代言人”，同一个 paraklētos。

当圣经说，我们若犯罪，“在父那里有一位中保”，如果我们信靠基督，就有这样一位为我们说话的人，这段经文至少预设了两件事：

第一，它预设——有一座“公义的法庭”，我们众人都站在其前，被控告、被定罪。三十五年的牧养经验告诉我——其实我刚开始牧会的时候，在第一间教会讲的第一篇道，就是在一个七月四日的主日——在这三十五年的牧会中，我认识了太多人，他们拼命想从“我是道德失败者”“我被定罪”的压力之下逃出来。一个很常见的方式就是搬来纽约：在这里，你会不断听到这样的声音：“对错是你自己决定的，你别让别人替你定标准；你自己为自己的人生确定对错。”一开始，这听起来很解放——好像终于不必为“罪恶感”买单了。

但过不了多久，你就会发现：世界上没有一个人，连他为自己设定的标准他都做不到；也没有人能做到他用来评判别人的那一套标准。无论如何，人生走到某个阶段，你迟早会发现——也许是你早年非常成功，后来却发现自己忽略了关系、变得很孤单；或者你从一开始就“失败”，以致觉得自己一事无成；又或者苦难临到你，让你不得不面对自己道德上的缺陷。每一个人，最终都会在心底深处承认：自己是一个道德上的失败者，是一个被定罪的人。

这种感觉可以在心里“沉睡”很久，但不会永远沉睡。今天你也许还没那么清楚感受到，但它可能潜伏在你里面。圣经说，有一座公义的法庭，有一位公义的审判者，我们都站在其前，被控告。

第二，这节经文也预设：当你信靠耶稣基督的时候，基督就站在那座法庭前，代表你，在父面前为你代求、替你申辩、为你做工。

我刚信主的时候，看见罗马书8章那句“有基督耶稣在神的右边，也替我们祈求”（又比如《希伯来书》7章说他“长远活着，替他们祈求”），心里多少得到一点安慰。因为我脑中想象的是：每当我犯罪，耶稣就走到父面前说：“求你不要丢弃他，求你怜悯他。是，他又做错了，他明明答应不再那样做，却又失败了；但再给他一次机会吧。”我以为他就是这样一遍又一遍地“求情”。

说实话，那并不太让我安心。因为我不禁要问：耶稣到底能坚持多久呢？他会不会有某天说：“我不想再替这个人开口了”？或者，会不会有一天父说：“对不起，已经五年了，他一直这样。够了。”这其实让我很不踏实。

直到我读到一篇讲章提纲，是十九世纪普林斯顿神学院一位教牧神学教授霍治（Charles Hodge）写的，他讲的就是“基督作我们的辩护者”。那篇东西真的改变了我。他说，你要明白：耶稣基督是你的辩护者，是站在你这边的法律代言人。他不是在那里单纯祈求人家“可怜可怜你”，那不是律师的工作。律师是在法律之上为当事人辩护，按着法律来陈述理由。他站在那座公义的法庭前，透过法律，来确保你不被定罪。

也就是说，他不是在那里苦苦哀求怜悯，他是在“据理力争”。霍治说，大概可以这样想：仿佛耶稣在说：“父啊，你是公义的，罪必须被审判。这位弟兄、这位姐妹，的确犯了罪；他没有尽心、尽性、尽意、尽力爱你，也没有爱人如己。他有罪，这罪必须被偿还。但父啊，请看我的身体，请看我流出的血——我已经为这罪付上代价。如果你再要求第二次付款，那就是不公义了。我已经付清了，所以我要求——不是恳求一点怜悯，而是请求公义：基于你的公义，请宣告他们无罪。”

换句话说，他所诉诸的，不是神“有没有一点同情心”，而是神的公义。到那一刻，我才真正明白。希望你能跟得上我三分钟里尝试表达的、其实是我生命中一个很重大的转折。

我突然意识到：许多宗教把“得救”想像成一杆天秤。一边是上帝的律法、公义、公正；另一边是我能献上的好行为。我过去一直以为：神的公义站在天秤一边，随时要把我压垮，我得拼命往另一边堆好行为——祷告、去教会、行善——好让天秤不要“倾倒在我身上”。换句话说，神的公义是“对我不利”的，我得靠自己拿东西去平衡它——不然，我就完了。

但当我明白什么叫“基督作我的辩护者”，我才知道：当你信靠基督，神的公义从此站在你这边。因为若再要你自己为罪付一遍代价，那才是不公义。你的罪已经被偿还，所以，神那全能、无误、无限的公义，现在反过来，要求“不可再定你的罪”。因此，保罗才会说：“如今，那些在基督耶稣里的就不定罪了。”

如果我们在天上有这样一位为我们辩护的保惠师，那圣灵在地上做什么？圣灵是我们在地上的保惠师，基督是我们在天上的保惠师。圣灵所做的，就是把天上那位保惠师的工作，应用在你地上这个人的心里，对抗你心中的仇敌。他在你里面“敲打”你，面对你的试探、你的骄傲、你的恐惧、你的自责，对你说：“看看耶稣已经做成的事。”

圣灵不是那种一直指向自己的保惠师。巴刻（J. I. Packer）曾经用一个极美的比喻。在《约翰福音》16章里，耶稣说：“他要荣耀我，因为他要将受于我的，告诉你们。”意思就是：圣灵不讲自己的荣耀，他所做的一切都是在高举基督。巴刻有一次要讲一篇关于圣灵的道，路上看到一盏射灯，把一栋白天平平无奇的老建筑照得金碧辉煌。他忽然意识到：自己根本注意不到射灯本身在哪儿，因为射灯的功能不是让人看见自己，而是让人看见它所照亮的对象的美。圣灵也是如此：他不是说“看我，来经历我的能力、我的喜乐”，而是说：“看耶稣，看看他多么美、他为你做成的工多么荣耀。看见他站在父右边，为你辩护，就知道没有什么失败、没有什么控告可以推翻你、把你打倒。”

圣灵就是那位在地上为你辩护的保惠师，他不断地把你眼光转向天上的那位保惠师，使他在天上为你所做的工，在你生命中变得如此真实、美好，以至于你的生命因此被改变。

“还没有亚伯拉罕，就有了我。”耶稣宣称他能赦免一切的罪。你知道这是什么意思吗？当他说“我可以赦免一切的罪”，这就意味着所有的罪都是得罪他，因为你只能赦免那些得罪你的罪。耶稣说他要审判世界。

所以耶稣不断在说：“我与神同等。”而现在他竟然大胆到说：“我要差遣给你们一位和我一样的那一位。”圣灵是一位位格，圣灵是神，而我们现在所进入的，就是令人头晕目眩的“三位一体”教义。我能让你被它稍微“晕一晕”吗？在这章的第二节（我们刚才没有读），耶稣不断在说：“我要走了。”

“我要走了，好吗？”然后在这里，第16节，他说：“但圣灵要来。”再往下到21节，他说：“我父要爱他，我也要爱他。”在21、22、23节里，他又说：“我们要到他那里去，与他同住。”所以，他说：“我要走了；圣灵要来；因此我也要来。”

耶稣并不是在说：“哦，其实我没有真的要走，我是以圣灵的形式再来找你们。”他也不是在说：“哦，我要走了，所以我就不来了，是他要来。”他与圣灵是如此合一，以至于当圣灵进入你的生命时，耶稣就来了；然而他又没有与圣灵完全同一，以至于他不再是在天上、已经离去的那一位。明白了吗？

可以吗？看，多简单啊，是吧？不，其实你知道，耶稣是在说：不是有三个神，因为那样的话太容易发展成三个神了。另一方面，也不是一个位格以三种形态出现。不是说，他有一顶“天父”的帽子，又有一顶“圣子”的帽子，还有一顶“圣灵”的帽子。

不是三个神——那样太容易变成三神论；但也不是一个神以三种形态出现——那样太容易变成形态论。乃是一位神，在三个位格中。同一位神，三个位格。明年我们会再回到这个教义。就我所能告诉你的，在我信主早期，这个教义像一块磨石挂在我脖子上，让我觉得极其困惑；我觉得“这也太绕了吧”。但今天，我认为它是最伟大的真理之一。

当你开始明白它的时候，你会看到它的美，而我现在不能再多展开了，因为我们这次不是要谈三位一体，而是要谈圣灵。但我想让你看到的是：为什么这一点如此重要。

当你开始明白它，就会看见它的美。我不能再多说三位一体，因为我们现在不是在讲三位一体，而是在讲圣灵。但我想让你看到，这一点为什么如此重要：圣灵不是一种非人格的力量，圣灵是在你生命中央的一位神圣位格。

为什么这很重要？哦，这太重要了。因为圣经谈到“被圣灵充满”。之后我们会有一整篇讲道专门讲“被圣灵充满”。被圣灵充满，就是经历难以置信的神圣喜乐与能力。

我想要这个，也想你得着这个。那么，你如何被圣灵充满呢？如果你想要被圣灵充满，却把圣灵当作一种非人格的力量，你追求它的方式就会完全不同；如果你明白，被圣灵充满，其实是被一位位格所充满，那就完全不一样了。

如果你试图去“获得”某种非人格的能力，你会用一种机械式的方法来追求它。举个例子：东方思想常常把神、把“神性”理解为一种非人格的力量。

在东方思想中，“神圣”被看作是一种非人格的力，因此，他们接近这位“神圣”的方式，就是冥想。但那种冥想是什么？是清空心思意念、清空理性思维、清空头脑中的言语，把里面都腾空。为什么？因为你要去接触那股“力量”。

但当你打开圣经，看到“默想”这个词时，你会发现它经常出现。可是基督徒的默想、圣经的默想，并不是把理性思维和文字从头脑中清空，而是把神的话语充满在心思意念里——这完全是另一种路径。

如果你把圣灵当成“它”，你就会用一种机械式的方式来追求。事实上，我真的看到很多有关“被圣灵充满”的基督徒教导，基本上就是把圣灵当成一种电流、一种充电。于是，你要被圣灵充满的方式，就是按按钮：你要用某些特定的方式祷告，做某些特定的事，避免做某些事，为某些事认罪。你把所有该按的按钮都按好，把你的生命调整到某种“环境条件”中，然后，“它”就进来了。

然后“它”就进来了——是“它”？不，不是的。如果圣灵是一位位格，那被圣灵充满就像是被一个人充满一样。

那是怎么回事呢？嗯，我记得，当我还小的时候，如果家里来了一位客人，要在我们家住一段时间——比如整个周末之类——而这位客人又是我父母非常尊敬的一个人，可能是一位来访的讲员、一位有身份的客人，或者是一位他们高度看重的亲戚，这就会改变一切。

首先，不知怎么的，家里突然变得格外漂亮。我们会把生活空间收拾得特别整洁、特别好看。其次，大家都表现得特别好，而且那不是装出来的。意思是：那些平常会让我们彼此不爽的小事，忽然变得不那么重要了，因为这位客人来了。

我们会抓住这位客人的每一句话。被圣灵充满，就是因着对这位荣耀的同住者有极其清醒的觉察，而让整个生命被翻转——这位荣耀的位格，永久地住在你生命的“房子”之内。

我以前跟你们讲过，我曾经辅导过一位男人，他出轨、有外遇，结果把自己的生活整个炸毁。他背着妻子和别的女人有关系。但他告诉我，每当他把情妇带回家里时，他必须把所有照片都翻过去——凡是有他妻子的照片、有他和妻子合影的照片，全部都要取下来或翻过去。因为无论是他，还是情妇，都无法忍受连一张妻子的照片在那里看着他们。就连那张照片的“临在”都会影响他们的行为。

你知道是谁住在你的生命里吗？你是否因着属灵的明白、因着对这位荣耀同住者的清醒觉察而被融化，以至于你的生活方式因此改变？单单意识到他的同在，就会让你充满对他同在的感受，并且会给你的生命带来正直。

有一些事，你现在正在做，如果你真正意识到他在这里，你就不会去做。如果你把那些照片再翻回来、挂回去，说：“哦，我得想一想我在做什么。”

当然，这也意味着你要抓住他的话语。

被圣灵充满，与被某种力量充满，是完全不同的，这就把我们带到了第二点：圣灵是住在基督徒心中的一位神圣位格。那么，圣灵做什么呢？这里有两个词告诉我们他做什么，而且非常精彩。

他是“真理的圣灵”（17 节），也是“保惠师”（或译“帮助者”、“辩护者”）。他是真理的灵，也是保惠师。所以，首先，他是真理的灵。这是什么意思呢？从一个层面上，我们知道：圣灵本质上是圣经的作者。

圣灵实际上就是圣经的作者。比如在彼得后书第一章那里说：“因为预言从来没有出于人意的，乃是人被圣灵感动，说出神的话来。”再看这里，约翰福音六章 63 节，耶稣说：“我对你们所说的话就是灵，就是生命。”换句话说，你在圣经里看到的耶稣的话，是由圣灵所赐的；如果你领受这些话、明白这些话，它们就把永生赐给你。

所以，从一个层面讲，圣灵是圣经的作者。事实上，这又回到了“被圣灵充满”的意思——如果圣灵是一位位格，而不是一种力量，那就不同了。你翻到以弗所书 5 章 18 节，那段著名经文里，保罗说：“不要醉酒，酒能使人放荡；乃要被圣灵充满。”然后他列出一大串“被圣灵充满的人生”的特征，我们现在不展开——之后会有一篇讲道专门讲这个。

以弗所书 5 章 18 节：“要被圣灵充满”，然后有一连串特征。如果你再去看他写给另一间教会的信——歌罗西书——翻到第三章。保罗写信给不同教会时，常常会讲类似的内容，因为他要把同样的基本真理传达给所有教会。在歌罗西书 3 章 16 节那里说的是什么？“当用各样的智慧，让基督的道丰丰富富地住在你们心里。”可以翻译成“让道充满你们”。然后又列出一大串“被道充满的人生”的特征。

他说：“当用各样的智慧，把基督的道丰丰富富地存在心里”，这其实就是“让道住在你里面”的意思。接着他列出一串特征，而那些特征，和以弗所书 5 章 18 节那里“被圣灵充满”的特征，是同一组。

这些，就是“被圣灵充满的生命”的特征。你知道这意味着什么吗？要被一个人充满、被一个人所主宰，就是抓住这个人每一句话；也就是让自己被那个人的话语完全浸透、支配。这就是“让道丰丰富富地住在你里面”——并不只是把它当作资讯装进脑袋，而是把它吃进去、消化掉，让它成为你的一部分。换句话说，可以这样来说明：

你可以“看”一副眼镜，但这并不是我花这么多钱买它的原因。我可不是为了把眼镜放在桌上，然后说：“亲爱的，你来看我的眼镜，多好看。”不是这样的。你把眼镜戴在脸上，然后透过眼镜看一切其它的东西。圣经也是如此：你可以“看”圣经，只是说我要学一些事实、掌握一些信息；但这不是目的。

让道“住在你里面”，不是单单“看”圣经，而是让你被圣经浸透，是把它吃进去、消化掉，以至于你透过它来看世界上的一切。这样，被道充满、被圣灵充满就是同一件事，因为他是真理的灵。

事实上，他在这里又更往前走一步。我们已经提到 21 节：

“有了我的命令（就是话语），又遵守的，这人就是爱我的。”爱我的必蒙我父爱他，我也要爱他，并且要向他显现。”

这很有意思。这是什么意思呢？这里有一些人，显然已经信了耶稣，也显然在遵行耶稣的话，他们在读神的道。耶稣却说：“我要向他显现。”这是在讲圣灵的经文里，耶稣说：“我要向他显现。”那是什么意思？难道他们还不知道耶稣是谁吗？当然知道，否则就不会是基督徒。

那这是什么？这是圣灵把话语变成生命，把话语变成能力。保罗在另一处也谈到同样的事情——这节经文对我个人来说，几乎是整本圣经里最重要的一节之一。以弗所书 3 章，保罗为他的朋友祷告，他说：

“求他按着他丰盛的荣耀，借着他的灵，叫你们心里的力量刚强起来；使基督因你们的信，住在你们心里。”

“我又祈求他，叫你们在爱中扎根、建造得以和众圣徒一同明白基督的爱是何等长阔高深，并且知道这爱是过于人所能测度的，便叫神一切所充满的，充满了你们。”

他在对基督徒说话，却说：“我祈求圣灵的大能，使基督住在你们心里。”可是，基督已经住在他们心里了，否则他们就不是基督徒。接着又说：“我祈求借着圣灵的能力，让你们能明白基督的爱是何等长阔高深。”难道他们还不知道基督的爱吗？当然知道，否则他们根本不会作基督徒。

但他又说：“我要你们知道这爱，是过于人所能测度的。”他在说什么？让我给你一个例子。

乔纳森·爱德华兹在他关于“灵修时间”的笔记本里写到：“我在许多时候，觉得圣经比任何书都令我极其喜悦。在阅读圣经时，往往每一个字都触动我的心。似乎每一句话都向我显出极大的光辉，从这些话语中不断有甘甜、令人心醉的养分涌入我的灵魂，以至于我无法匆匆略读，而是常常停留在一句话上，久久不愿离开，为要看见其中所包含的奇妙。每当我这样读经时，对属天事物的感觉，往往突然在我心里点燃一种甘甜的火热，在我内里发出一种馨香的焚烧，是我无法形容的。”

——其实，他已经形容得相当不错了。你看，他在说什么？一回事是“读圣经”；另一回事，是圣灵在圣经里向你显明耶稣基督。

一回事，是“知道”基督住在你心里；另一回事，是“感觉到”他住在你心里。我们上周也提过这个：一回事，是在头脑里知道“糖是甜的”；另一回事，是把它放进嘴里，让你的全人都被那甜蜜所触动；你不仅知道，而且尝到了。这就是圣灵的工作。

他不但是真理的客观作者——因为他写下了圣经；他也是真理的主观施行者——让这真理在你生命里活过来。

他让这真理活起来、鲜活有力，使之带来生命的改变——这是圣灵所做的第一件事。但信不信由你，他的工作不止于此。

因为如果他只做这些，他还比较像一个顾问，像一个你雇来、不时给你一点东西的人。但他不只是这样。他还是一位“保惠师”（或“帮助者”、“辩护者”）。其实这是整段经文的重点：“我要求父，父就另外赐给你们一位保惠师。”

如果你翻开五六种不同的英文译本，会看到五六种不同的翻译。每当你看到不同译本在同一个词上用的英文词差别很大，就说明原文的这个词太丰富，以至于没有一个单一英文词能够完全涵盖它的意思，所以译者们都在苦苦摸索。

有些人用的是旧版《钦定本》或其它版本，会译成“Comforter”（安慰者）。这是个很温柔的词，但多少让圣灵听起来有点像一床被子，所以现在不太用了。就算用今天常见的词“Counselor”（辅导者、顾问），你也会问：是夏令营的辅导员？还是婚姻辅导？到底是哪一种？

其实，学者们至少有一件事是确定的，也正因为如此，我们很难找到一个好词来翻。他们知道，这里用的就是“parakaleo / parakletos / paraklesis”这一组字。这个词本身在希腊文里就很难翻。Para- 意味着站在旁边，不是在前面压着你，也不是在后面推你，而是并肩而立；kaleo 则是“呼喊、讲论、申辩”，甚至带有“辩论”的意思。

因此，最贴切的翻法其实是：“我要赐给你们另一位法律上的辩护者（legal advocate）。”

这个词带出两个层面：一方面，这个人是“你的人”，站在你的立场上代表你，对你忠心到底，是“完全向着你”的那一位；另一方面，他又是会辩论、会申诉、会陈词立论的人——为你抵挡仇敌的控告。这里既有温柔的一面——与您同情、与您一同受苦；也有刚强的一面——为你争辩、为你作战。

那为什么耶稣基督要说圣灵是你的“法律辩护者”呢？这是什么意思？我认为，意思就是：圣灵的工作，是为你抵挡地上各样的仇敌，更是为你抵挡你自己心里那一切的仇敌。

比如罗马书 8 章 15 节说：“你们所受的不是奴仆的心，仍旧害怕；所受的乃是儿子的心，因此我们呼叫：‘阿爸！父！’”你知道这是什么意思吗？这就是说：我们的心里充满了恐惧，而圣灵进来，就对我们争辩、对我们说：“不！神爱你，你是他的儿女。”

再下一节，罗马书 8 章 16 节说：“圣灵与我们的心同证我们是神的儿女。”我们上周提到这节经文，只不过当时没特别提一个细节：这里“同证”的那个词，是当时法庭上的技术用语，指的是“关键证人、重量级证人”。也就是那个站出来作证，一锤定音的人。

所以，这里在说什么？我们的心里充满了疑惑，充满了怀疑；而圣灵进来，对我们说：“不！你没有理由怀疑。你是属他的，你被爱着。”

再看希伯来书 12 章，那整章都在讲受苦、讲临到我们的各种艰难。在那里说：“你们又忘了那劝你们如同劝儿子的哪话。”原文的意思就是：“那向你辩论、向你申明的哪话。”

他接着引用箴言 3 章，说：“我儿，你不可轻看主的管教……因为主所爱的，他必管教。”希伯来书作者在说：圣经的角色，是在你落在低谷时，向你“争辩”。

苦难临到你，坏事发生，你就觉得：“哦，我被撇下了。”但照希伯来书的说法，圣经会站出来与你辩论，说：“不，你是他的孩子，他没有丢弃你。好父亲常常会熬炼儿女，而你眼下所经历的，就是这样的熬炼。”

这一切意味着什么呢？约翰一书 3 章 20 节有一句话：“我们若心里责备自己，神比我们的心大。”我稍微改写一下意思，就是：“我们若心里责备自己，圣灵比我们的心大。”

圣灵的工作，就是与你的心辩论。我们的心天生不喜欢“恩典”这个观念，我们其实并不自然地喜欢“福音”——那种“完全靠恩典得救”的福音。我们宁可靠表现、靠功德来赢得救恩，因为那让我们觉得自己掌控局面。正因为我们的内心深处有这种东西，所以我们不断被恐惧、怀疑所搅扰。

当坏事发生，我们马上说：“看，他不要我了。我不够好，他不可能爱我。”而圣灵就进来，与我们辩论，向我们陈明事实。他拿着福音，一遍又一遍地敲打我们的心，直到你开始松开、开始安息为止。

但圣灵不仅仅是在控告面前为你申辩，他也在试探面前为你争战。雅各书 4 章有一段颇为难解的话：雅各先说：“岂不知与世俗为友就是与神为敌吗？”然后又说：“你们想经上所说是徒然的吗？神所赐住在我们里面的灵，是恋爱至于嫉妒（或：渴望到嫉妒）的。”这句经文很难翻，他们有时译作“圣灵恋慕我们直到嫉妒”，等等。

意思是什么呢？就是：当你开始与世界为友、远离神的时候，住在你里面的圣灵会深深渴望你的心归向神。

圣灵看见我们把心给了金钱、给了名声、给了性、给了权力，而不是给神。当他看见我们的心正把我们从神那里拖走——而他又知道那样最终会毁掉我们——圣灵就会像一个深深爱着瘾君子朋友的人那样行事。

当你爱一个人，却看见他正被瘾捆绑、一步步毁掉自己的生命，你会怎么做？你会把他拉到角落，对他说：“你在杀自己，我不会看着不管。我爱你，所以我要拦住你，我要质问你、对抗你。”你们甚至可能闹翻天，吵到几乎要打起来。

但这正是我们在圣灵那里所拥有的。这是一位朋友、一位保惠师、一位法律辩护者——一位不会任凭你自我毁灭的人。

他是一位荣耀的位格，保罗在腓立比书 1 章说：“在你们心里动了善工的，必成全这工，直到耶稣基督的日子。”这位圣灵是荣耀的位格，他不会停手，直到你成为你本该成为的那位荣耀之人。

他会抵挡你心里一切要击沉你的东西，他不会放手。这是一位带着“牙齿”的爱来爱你的朋友——正因为他完全为你、向着你，有时他就必须“反对你，为着你”。

你可能会说：“要是早知道会这样，我当初就该三思要不要邀请这位进入我的生命。”不，我只是希望你认真思想这一切的含义。

所以，是的，圣灵的工作是把圣经赐给你，也是把圣经在你里面变得真实、有力、鲜活。但他并不只是为了给你一些“属灵体验”才这么做。他进到你的生命里，是彻底委身要把神在你重生那一刻开始的善工，一直带到耶稣基督的日子成全；他不会放手。你看，他是一位“保惠师”，可不是夏令营的辅导员。

那里说：“你们又忘了那劝你们如同劝儿子的哪话。”——原文意思是“那与您辩论、规劝你的那句话”。“我儿，你不可轻看主的管教，因为主所爱的，他必管教。”希伯来书的作者在引用箴言第三章，他是在说：当你情绪低落的时候，圣经的职责就是来和你“争辩”。

苦难临到了你，坏事发生在你身上，你觉得：“哦，我被撇下了。”但照希伯来书所说，圣经会站出来和你“争辩”。怎么争辩呢？

像对儿女说话一样，圣经对你说：“不，你是他的孩子，他没有丢弃你。好父亲常常会操练儿女，而你现在经历的，就是这种操练。”

这一切意味着什么呢？约翰一书三章二十节有一句话：“我们若心里责备自己，神比我们的心大。”我稍稍改写一下，就是：“我们若心里责备自己，圣灵比我们的心大。”

圣灵的工作，就是与你的心辩论。我们的心天然不喜欢“恩典”这个观念，我们其实并不真喜欢“福音”——那种“我们是靠恩典得救”的福音。我们更想靠自己赢得，靠表现来获取，这样我们就能掌控一切。正因为我们心里有这种倾向，我们就不断被恐惧和怀疑所搅扰。

当坏事发生，我们就说：“不、不，他丢弃我了。我不够好，他不可能爱我。”而圣灵便进来，与我们辩论；他为我们陈明事实。他拿着福音，一次又一次地“敲打”你，直到你开始放松、开始安息。

但圣灵不仅仅是在控告面前为我们辩护，他也在试探面前为我们争战。雅各书第四章有一段很难翻的经文：雅各先说：“岂不知与世俗为友就是与神为敌吗？”接着说：“你们想经上所说是徒然的吗？神所赐住在我们里面的灵，是恋爱至于嫉妒（或：渴望到嫉妒的地步）。”译者们不知道该怎样翻，有的翻成“圣灵恋慕我们直到嫉妒”。

意思是什么呢？就是：当你开始让世界把你从神那里拉走的时候，住在你里面的圣灵，极其渴望你的爱。

圣灵看见我们把心给了金钱，或把心给了名声，把心给了性，把心给了权力，而不是给神。当圣灵看见我们的内心正把我们从神那里拉走，而且他知道这终究会毁掉我们——

他就会像一个深爱瘾君子的朋友那样行事。你若爱一个人，却看见他因瘾而一步一步毁掉自己的生命，你会怎么做？你会把他拉到角落，对他说：“你在杀自己，我不会让你这样下去。我要面对你、指出你的问题、抵挡你，因为我爱你，我不会任凭你自我毁灭。”你们甚至可能几乎要动手打起来。

你会有这样的朋友，他们来告诉你：“你错了，你正在毁掉自己，我不会袖手旁观。”你可能因此对他们气得要命，甚至闹翻。但当我们有圣灵住在生命里的时候，我们拥有的就是这样的一位。

这是一位朋友，这是一位保惠师，这是一位法律辩护者——一位不会任凭你自我毁灭的人。他是一位荣耀的位格，保罗在腓立比书一章说：“在你们心里动了善工的，必成全这工，直到耶稣基督的日子。”

这位圣灵是荣耀的位格，他不会停手，直到你成为你本该成为的那位荣耀之人。他要抵挡你心中一切会把你击沉的东西，他不会放手。这是一位“带着牙齿”的爱来爱你的朋友——一位完全向着你的人，这也意味着，有时候他必须“反对你，为着你”。

你可能会说：“早知道这样，我当初就该三思要不要邀请这位进入我的生命。”不，我只是希望你认真思想这一切的含义。

所以，是的，圣灵的工作是把圣经赐给你，也是把圣经在你里面变得真实、有力、鲜活。但他并不只是为了给你一些“属灵体验”才这么做。他进到你的生命里，是完全委身要把神在你重生那一刻开始的善工，一直带到耶稣基督的日子成全；他不会放手。你看，他是一位“保惠师”，可不是夏令营的辅导员。

他不会“回家不管”。

他也不像你偶尔去看的婚姻辅导员，然后你说：“我从他那儿得不到什么。”不是这样的。他是一位永远在岗的法律辩护者，是一位随时准备对你“做干预”的永远朋友。

他是“向着你”的（para，并肩而立），但有时他又会“为了你而反对你”。这就是在生命中拥有圣灵的奇妙之处。

最后，也是非常重要的一点：你如何——我先不说“被圣灵充满”（那我们之后会讲）——你如何确定自己正真实地领受圣灵所要赐给你的那些益处？我认为在这段经文里至少有两个答案。我们先只待在这段经文里，关于圣灵还有太多可以说的，但我们先只从这里来讲。

第一点：让圣灵的大能在你生命中运行，使你成为你应当成为、也可以成为的那个人，其关键在于：你要懂得“第一位辩护者”。

你看，当耶稣说：“我要赐给你们另外一位保惠师（辩护者）”时，他是在说什么？他在说他自己。谁是“第一位保惠师”？就是他自己。他是第一位保惠师。

而这个词——parakletos，法律辩护者——在约翰另一卷书里也用在耶稣身上：不是在《约翰福音》，而是在《约翰一书》。他在那里说（这是和合本意思）：

“我小子们哪，我将这些话写给你们，是要叫你们不犯罪。若有人犯罪，在父那里我们有一位中保（辩护者），就是那义者耶稣基督。他为我们的罪作了挽回祭。”

新译本会把那句翻成“我们在父那里有一位为我们说情的，就是那义者耶稣基督。”原文其实就是：“我们在父那里，有一位辩护者。”我们在父那里有一位 parakletos，有一位法律辩护者。

当圣经说，当我们犯罪的时候，若我们信靠耶稣基督，就在父那里有一位辩护者，这段经文至少假设了几件事：

第一，它假设有一个真正的“公义法庭”——有一座公义的审判台，在那里我们所有人都站在被告席上，被宣判为有罪。

在我三十五年的牧会生涯中——事实上，我意识到，我在第一间教会所讲的第一篇讲道，是在 7 月 4 日的主日——这三十五年里，我见过无数的人拼命想摆脱“自己在道德上失败、被定罪”的那种感觉。

其中一个最常见的方式，就是搬到纽约来：在这里你会被告知“没有客观的是非标准，要由你自己来决定什么对你是对、什么对你是错；你不要让别人替你决定什么是道德，你自己决定什么对你是对、什么对你是错。”

于是好些年里，你会说：“你看，我不必感到内疚，我自己决定什么对我来说是对或错。”直到你逐渐意识到：全世界没有一个人，连自己定下的标准都做不到——甚至你用来衡量别人的那些标准，你自己都达不到。

无论你的人生如何展开——也许你一开始事业很成功，但后来发现自己忽略了关系，现在孤单一人；也许你一开始事业不顺，一直觉得自己是失败者；或者当苦难临到时，它会迫使你正视自己的道德缺陷。

最终，每个人内心深处都有一种被定罪的感觉。每个人都知道自己在道德上是失败的。那种感觉可以长时间地沉睡在一个人里面，也许在你里面也沉睡已久。

但确实有一座公义的法庭，确实有一个审判台，在那里我们都站在被告席上——这是第一点。

第二点，这段经文也假设：当你信靠耶稣基督的时候，耶稣基督就站在那公义的法庭上，代表你，为你代求，为你申辩。

当我刚信主的时候，我读到罗马书第八章有一句话说：“基督耶稣在神的右边，也替我们祈求。”希伯来书七章也说他“长远活着，替他们祈求”。当时这句经文给我带来一点安慰，在我脑海里，它的画面大概是这样的：每当我犯罪，耶稣就走到父面前说：“别离弃他，求你怜悯他，”类似这样的话。

好像他说：“我知道他答应不会再做这件事，但他又做了，再给他一次机会吧。”我那时候大概就是这样想的。老实说，这并没有带给我太多安慰，因为我总在想：耶稣还要这样“求情”多久？他什么时候会说：“为了这个人，我不会再去父面前一次又一次了”？

或者父什么时候会说：“对不起，这已经五年了……”——这些想象并不能真正安慰我。

直到我读到一份讲章提纲，是十九世纪普林斯顿神学院的神学家查尔斯·霍奇（Charles Hodge）写的，他在学院灵修会里讲“基督为我们的辩护者”时，说了一些话，从此改变了我。

他说，你要知道：耶稣基督确实是你的辩护者，他是你在那公义法庭前的法律代表。但你必须明白一件事：他并不是站在那里单纯“求怜悯”。那根本不是一位法律辩护人所做的事。

一位法律辩护人是要“陈明案情”的，他要根据律法来立论。他在那里的工作，就是根据律法来确保你被判为“无可定罪”。他不是在那儿哀求怜悯，而是在陈明“合法的理由”。

我当时心里一惊：“什么？”

然后霍奇大概是这样说的：当圣经谈到“基督是我们的辩护者”时，它要表达的意思，大概可以像这样想象——当然这是拟人化的想象——仿佛耶稣对父说：

“父啊，你是公义的，罪必须被付上代价。这位我的弟兄或我的姊妹确实犯罪了：他没有尽心、尽性、尽力、尽意爱你，他也没有爱人如己。他确实犯罪了，而罪必须被付上代价。

但父啊，看！这是代价——看我的身体如何被打碎，看我的宝血如何被倒出。我已经为他的罪付上代价。若你再向这同一罪索取第二次付款，那就是不公义的。既然我已经付上了代价，他就不可能再为同一罪再付一次代价，因此我不是单单在求怜悯，我是按着公义要求：为我这位弟兄宣告无罪释放，因为我已经为他的罪付上代价。”

“因此，他再不可能为同一罪再付代价，也就不可能再落在任何定罪之下。我请求——不，我要求——宣告他无罪，这是合乎公义的。”

你看，耶稣是在“诉诸公义”。这就是霍奇所讲的。当我明白这一点时——我希望你能跟我一起进入这个转折点——我花了几分钟才抓住这对我生命是一个“分水岭”。

我意识到，所有的宗教大致都把救恩看成是一个天平。你知道那位蒙着眼、手里拿着天平的女人，那就是“公义”的象征。我曾经以为，上帝的律法、公义，就像是天平的一边，而我必须在另一边不断往上面堆“好行为”，好叫天平不要压垮我。

我觉得上帝的公义是“对我不利”的——它在那里说：“你最好行得端正，你最好行得端正。”于是我竭尽全力，从自己生命里挤出所有可能的善行、祷告、去教会、各种属灵操练，全都往那边堆，只盼望能稍稍“平衡”上去；否则，我就完了。

但我后来发现，当你信靠耶稣基督作你的救主，当他成为你的法律辩护者时，意味着上帝的公义不再是“对你不利”，而是站在你这一边。

因为，若同一罪要收两次付款，那就是不公义；而你的罪已经在基督里被一次性付清。因此，上帝的公义——那全能、无误、无限的公义——现在要求：你不再被定罪。

这对你意味着什么？如果我们在天上有这样一位辩护者，那么圣灵在地上又在做什么呢？

圣灵就是我们在地上的辩护者。耶稣基督是我们在天上的辩护者。圣灵所做的，就是把天上那位辩护者的工作，应用在地上、应用在你内心的战场上。

他不断地向你“重申案情”，在你心里对付你的试探、你的骄傲、你的恐惧、你的自责与控告，对你说：“看耶稣已经做成的。”

然而要记得，圣灵并不是指向自己的辩护者。

巴刻（J.I. Packer）对这一点有极美的描述。约翰福音十六章那里说：“他要荣耀我，因为他要将受于我的告诉你们。他不说从自己来的，只说他所听见的。”耶稣说：“圣灵要荣耀我，他不为自己说什么。”

巴刻是一位圣公会牧师，有一次他在预备一篇关于圣灵的讲道时，在路上为这篇讲道寻找一个好比喻。那时候天已经暗了，他看见一盏探照灯，把一栋白天看起来其貌不扬的老建筑照得格外美丽。那一刻，他突然意识到一个事实：他甚至看不出探照灯究竟在哪里。

他说：“我根本注意不到探照灯本身，因为探照灯的职责不是吸引人注意它自己，而是要把所照亮的那座建筑的美丽与壮观显明出来。”

他说：“这就是圣灵。”圣灵的工作，不是对你说：“看我！来得着我的能力，来得着我的喜乐。”圣灵的工作，是对你说：“看耶稣！看他所成就的何等美丽。看他现在站在父面前，为你辩护。难道你看不见吗？没有任何危险，没有任何失败，没有任何控告，能够推翻那已成就的工作、能够把你打倒——没有。”

圣灵的工作，就是在地上作辩护者，把你目光转向那位在天上的辩护者，让他在天上为你所做的工，在你生命中显得这么美、这么宝贵，以至于你的生命被改变。

好，现在有两点实际应用。我想邀请你在这两点上作出改变，哪怕你会说：“哎，我已经被提醒了好多需要改变的地方。”好，那就再加上这两点：

第一，请你注意“神性里那种极其宏伟的无私”。

看耶稣基督，他倒空自己荣耀，为要成为仆人，为要在十字架上为我们的罪而死；再看圣灵，他不高举自己的荣耀，而是不断地荣耀耶稣。

神的心深处，必定有一种“向着他人”的倾向；在神里面，有一种“自我倒空”的美，有一种心态在说：“我的生命是为你而舍的。”——在神里面，有一种“我在这里，是要服侍你”的心。

看，耶稣倒空自己的荣耀；看，圣灵只把耶稣的荣耀显给我们看。

那你呢？你是否总是在推销自己？你是否总是因别人不给你应得的重视而愤愤不平？你是否常常觉得自己“没有被看见”？

第二点：或者相反地，你是否觉得自己是个冒牌货？你是否在拒绝的阴影下挣扎？在纽约，总有试镜，总有面试，总有各种选拔，我们不断面对被拒绝的可能。

你们中间是不是有人就这样常常在拒绝中挣扎？你是否在许多方面都觉得自己像个失败者？你是否害怕身边的人看见你内里有多缺乏信心、你其实多么不喜欢自己、几乎有点厌恶自己？

你需要一位辩护者——而你已经有了：一位在天上，一位在地上。你其实已经拥有了你所需要的一切。请抓住他。

让我们祷告。
