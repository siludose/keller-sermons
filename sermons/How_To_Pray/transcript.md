# How To Pray

## English Transcript

*[Key excerpts preserved for reference]*

### Why Prayer Matters

We live in a society starved for experience, absolutely starved for a sense of authority and for any kind of deep experience of the soul. Because we live in a secular technological society that reduces everything to commodity. All of this—the meditation, the workout regimens, the therapy, the New Age movement—these are substitutes for prayer, for the vacuum left in our lives because we do not pray or don't know how to pray.

No amount of sex, no amount of therapy, no amount of meditation can substitute for prayer, which is intimacy with the infinite. ### Prayer is Difficult

I happen to know that it's harder to pray for 30 minutes than it is to preach for 30 minutes. I've never had a sermon so bad that I forgot I was preaching.

But many times when I've been on my knees before the King of the universe, I've forgotten I was praying. John Newton says that when he's trying to pray, he feels so weak that sometimes "the buzzing of a fly in the room is an overmatch for my strength."

### The Basis of Prayer

Jesus says, "Our Father." Not "our King" (though he is), not "our Creator" (though he is), but "our Father."

Jesus was the first person to call God Father in the Bible. When Jesus called God Father, everybody was shocked.

If you belong to Jesus, you automatically receive his status. You can talk to God as Father. My Father in heaven loves me more than I love myself.

### The Essence of Prayer: Praise

Only three small petitions in the Lord's Prayer. Everything else is about God. Adoration is the only thing that will heal us.

Job's self-pity drained out because your self-pity comes from forgetting it's all of grace. His worry drained out because worry comes from forgetting God's goodness. His resentment drained out because resentment comes from forgetting it's all God's mercy.

Jesus Christ said: I want you to pray all the time so you don't faint. Those are the only two alternatives. You can pray or faint.
