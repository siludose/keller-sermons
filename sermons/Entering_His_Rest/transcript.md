# Entering His Rest

## English Transcript

Welcome to Gospel in Life. Do you ever wish life came with an owner's manual, a guide to follow when you're facing difficult decisions or just trying to live with integrity in the small everyday moments? Today on Gospel in Life, Tim Keller shows us how the Ten Commandments help us align our lives with God's will, not by restricting us with outdated rules, but by laying the foundation from which we can live a life of true freedom and flourishing.

**Hebrews 4:1-12:**

Therefore since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it, for we also have had the gospel preached to us, just as they did. But the message they heard was of no value to them, because those who heard did not combine it with faith. Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said, so I declared on oath in my anger, they shall never enter my rest.

And yet his work has been finished since the creation of the world. For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words, and on the seventh day God rested from all his work. We're in a series of sermons on the Ten Commandments, and today we're talking about the commandment that says, honor the Sabbath day, the day of rest.

One of the most important themes in the Bible is the theme of rest. Psalm chapter 3 is one of my favorite chapters. In the psalm it says, "O Lord, how many are my foes, how many there are that rise up against me, but thou, O Lord, art a shield for me.

My glory and the lifter of my head. Therefore I lie down and I sleep, and I awake for you sustain me. I will not fear, though tens of thousands would encamp against me."

That's an amazing passage.

Here is a man who goes to sleep the night before a battle knowing full well that he's greatly outnumbered, and he sleeps. And he rests. The great question in life is, do you know how to lie down and sleep?

Because anybody can lie down, but can you sleep? Can you rest? I would propose to you that this is the real way for you to tell the validity of your faith.

What is the Sabbath rest? It's the REM of the soul. You know what REM is?

Rapid eye movement. Scientists will tell you that the thing that restores the body is not the length of your sleep, it's the depth. It's not how long you're sleeping, but whether you get into those periods of deep sleep.

**The Trial - Kafka's Message:**

Franz Kafka wrote a novel called The Trial. It's about a man named Joseph K. who wakes up one morning on his 30th birthday and discovers that he has been arrested.

He's under house arrest and waiting trial. And they will not tell him what he's arrested for. Joseph K.

falls back on two clichés that many of us use: The world is a rational place, and I am basically a decent person. But these don't work. He begins to look his life over and remembers dishonesties, betrayals, ways that he cut corners.

Eventually, he feels more and more anxiety, guilt, and condemnation. The great minds of the 20th century drive home the same thing: the world is not a rational place, people are not all that decent, and if you look carefully, you'll see that you're not all that decent either. **Romans 2 - The Invisible Tape Recorder:**

Romans chapter 2 says: "You have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else.

For whatsoever point you judge another, you are judging yourself because you do the same thing."

Imagine God put an invisible tape recorder around your neck the day of your birth. It only clicks on whenever you tell somebody else how they ought to be. On judgment day, God will say, "I'm going to be very fair.

I'm not going to judge you by the Word of God. All I'm going to do is judge you by your own standards."

Nobody will pass that test. **How to Enter the Rest:**

To enter the rest of God means you have to hear the gospel.

Two parts:

1. **Rest from hiding your sin.** There is no peace and rest for the soul unless first there's conviction of sin. The only way for the trial to be over is for you to say, "I'm guilty," instead of going around saying, "I know there's an explanation somewhere."

2.

**Rest from your works.** Jesus Christ came to live in your place. He came to do everything necessary that you should do. The principle is this: Only Jesus Christ can be a Christian.

Only God could really be human. The moment you receive him by faith, you have received the righteousness of Christ instead of working at your own righteousness. **The Test of Rest:**

When somebody accuses you of something and you're a Christian with rest, you can sit there and listen.

If they're right, you say, "You're right." Because deep down you say, "Yes, there's a lot of bad things like that in my life. But God knows it and He accepts me completely, so I don't have to defend myself." That's rest. "Lay your deadly doing down, down at Jesus' feet.
