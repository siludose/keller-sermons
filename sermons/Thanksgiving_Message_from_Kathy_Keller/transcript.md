# Thanksgiving Message from Kathy Keller

## English Transcript

### Thanksgiving and God's Gracious Provision

#### Introduction: Thanksgiving and God's Provision

Hi, I'm Kathy Keller. Each year when we get to Thanksgiving, we pause to recognize all the ways God has been so gracious in His provision, both for our basic physical needs and for the ways that He provides for us spiritually to give us joy, hope, and renewal through His Son Jesus Christ. #### The Importance of Focusing on God

Thanksgiving has the potential to become broke or generic if we don't put our focus on God and His goodness.

I want to encourage you to use the day as an opportunity to meditate on His word and the direction it gives us to see God and all He is. **Our strength and shield, our helper, our refuge, our Savior and friend.**

And I know I'm going to be just as much as you are up to my ears and stuffing and mashed potatoes and guests and everything, but just go lock yourself in the bathroom for five minutes for heaven's sakes and be thankful or something.

### Strength, Shield, and Song of Thanks

#### Psalm 28:6-7 Reflection

Listen to these words from Psalm 28 verses 6 and 7.

**Psalm 28:6-7 (ESV):**

> Blessed be the Lord for He has heard the voice of my pleas for mercy. The Lord is my strength and my shield in Him my heart trusts and I am helped and my heart exalts and with my song I give thanks to Him. These verses are a powerful reminder of all we have because Jesus loved us so much that He gave His life for us.

### Gratitude for Ministry Impact in 2025

#### Gratitude for Gospel and Life's Impact

I encourage you to think of all the ways God provides for you and I trust that God's spirit will generate joy, praise, and thanksgiving that comes from focusing on His amazing love. Please join us as we give thanks for all God is doing and for all He's done through gospel and life this past year. We're so grateful for the encouragement we get from the messages we receive telling us how God is bringing people to trust God through you and through this ministry.

So it's not merely a throwaway kind of statement when I say we have so much to be thankful for this year. We really do. And I want to note just a few things our team here at gospel and life gives thanks for in 2025:

- For the more than 214,000 people who receive our quarterly journal and emails
- For the millions of people who've listened to our podcast around the world
- For the thousands of people who shared one of our resources with someone
- For the 284,000 downloads of the questioning Christianity podcast by people exploring or sharing the gospel

### Closing: Thanks Be to God
