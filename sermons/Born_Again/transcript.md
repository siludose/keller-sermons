# Born Again

## English Transcript

### The Text

> **John 1:12-13:**
> "Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God—children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God."

### Born Again is Essential

Jesus was the first one to say "you must be born again" and he said it to Nicodemus—about as admirable a figure as possible. He knows the Bible, he's incredibly moral, but he's not self-righteous. He's pulled together, he's successful.

And what does Jesus say to him? "You must be born again to even understand the first thing about the kingdom of God."

It can't be a call to get more religious. It can't be a call to get more moral structure in your life.

It's a challenge to traditional religion. ### Born Again is Radical

**New Life**: Being born again means organic growth—growing in love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, humility. Not growing your resume, but growing personally.

**New Identity**: You are adopted as a child of God. That means intimacy—the Father loves you with all the love he loves his only begotten Son. And inheritance—we will inherit the new heavens and new earth.

### Born Again is Simple but Hard

To believe in his name means to repent and rest. Repentance means coming with nothing—recognizing that everything you've ever done, good and bad, was trying to create your own identity instead of resting in what Christ has done. "All you need is nothing, but most people don't have it."

Jesus said in John 16: "A woman giving birth has pain because her hour has come, but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy." Jesus is saying: You are born through my pain, my suffering, my work, at the cost of my life.

But like a woman in labor, when I see you, my joy overwhelms my pain.
