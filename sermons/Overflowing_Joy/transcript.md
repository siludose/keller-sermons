# Overflowing Joy

### Introduction and Scripture Reading

Welcome to Gospel in Life. During January, we're inviting our listeners to consider becoming a Gospel in Life monthly partner. If you'd like to learn more, keep listening at the end of today's podcast for details.

Do you ever wish life came with an owner's manual, a guide to follow when you're facing difficult decisions or just trying to live with integrity in the small everyday moments? Today on Gospel in Life, Tim Keller shows us how the Ten Commandments help us align our lives with God's will, not by restricting us with outdated rules, but by laying the foundation from which we can live a life of true freedom and flourishing. And now, brothers, we want you to know about the grace that God has given to the Macedonian churches.

Out of the most severe trial, their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity, for I testify that they gave as much as they were able, and even beyond their ability, entirely on their own, they urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the saints. And they did not do as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us in keeping with God's will. So we urge Titus, since he had earlier made a beginning, to bring also to completion this act of grace on your part.

But just as you excel in everything, in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in your love for us, see that you excel in this grace of giving. I am not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others. For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that through his poverty you might become rich.

We're returning to a series that we gave up about a month ago for Christmassy themes, and that's a series on the Ten Commandments. The Ten Commandments, we're saying, are like high steel. You know, the high girders that have to be thrust up into the sky so that a skyscraper can be built on it?

In the same way, the Ten Commandments are high steel. The Ten Commandments are not confining chains, chains that confine our human potentiality, nor are the Ten Commandments busy work from some cosmic algebra teacher who's trying to keep us off the streets. Rather, the Ten Commandments are high steel, a framework on which to build a life of greatness.

### Money: From Dignity to Destructive Definition

Money, this shouldn't come to a surprise in this city, money is really just a measure of your power. Money is power. The more money you have, the more choices you have.

The more of the world you control, the more choices you have, the more power you have. That's all money is. It's a measure of how much of the world you control.

Money was designed to be our dignity. There's no human dignity without money. Money answers to something God put down deep in us, and that is we all need to have part of the world to care for.

And without any part of the world to care for, we have no dignity. So money is supposed to be our dignity, but what has happened in most of our lives because of sin and the effects of sin on us, money has not, instead of being our dignity, money has become our definition. And that's different.

And what that does then is that turns money into a destructive power in your life.

### Three Principles of Gospel Generosity

The three principles that Paul talks about are these. Number one, God owns everything that you've got.

Number two, Jesus impoverished himself for you. And number three, you can take it with you. God owns everything you've got, so you've got to act like a trustee.

Jesus gave everything for you, so you're free for radical generosity. And you can take it with you if you invest it in eternal things. There's two kinds of thievery.

### Two Kinds of Thievery

The first kind of thievery is when we refuse to honor the caretaker rights of other human beings. The second kind of stealing is you've got to honor the owner's rights over your own wealth or you're stealing. In Malachi chapter 3, God says, will you rob me?

How can you rob God? You rob me in tithes and offerings.

### Like Christ in Giving: It's Your Happiness I Want

Robert Murray McShane was a Scottish minister who preached in Scotland over 150 years ago, and he said: "Oh, my dear friends, if you would be like Christ, and you pray that you will be, become like him in giving.

Though he was rich, yet for our sakes he became poor. Objection, someone says. My money is my own.

Answer. Well, Christ might have said, my blood is my own, my life is my own, and then where would you be? My dear Christians, if you want to be like Christ, give much, give often, give freely, even to the vile, even to the undeserving.

Christ is glorious and happy, and so shall you be. It's not your money I want. It's your happiness.

Remember his own word. It's more blessed.
