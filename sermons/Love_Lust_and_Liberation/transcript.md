Turn in your bulletins to the passage in which the teaching is based. We're going through the sermon on the Mount. And today we come to Jesus' teaching about sex and sexuality, Matthew 5.

You've heard that it was said, did not commit adultery. I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right hand causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away, it's better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.

And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It's better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell. It's God's Word.

Now if you're a first-time visitor, what a wonderful text that you've chosen to come and learn about redeemer on him. And actually, this is seriously, if you read this text and that's all you know about what the Bible says about sex, what Jesus says, if you don't look at it in the context and we will. And think about its meaning in the light of everything else.

You might look at that and you say, this confirms everything I always thought. The church is uptight about sex. Look at this.

You're going to hell if you lust. Lust. In this day and age, lust.

What a negative view of sex. That is a very reasonable response. If you read it on the surface, but here's what I want you to see.

Here's what I want to see today. On the surface, one of the most unattractive things about Christianity is its view of sex today. But if you look underneath the surface and get a better grasp on what is really taught, actually, Christian view of sex is one of the most attractive things about it.

In other words, on the surface, a lot of people see the Christian understanding of sex is really being one of the things that undermines its credibility to them. But when you look down deeper, I think you're actually going to see, I believe, that the Christian view of sex is one of the evidences for its truth. Because Christianity accounts for how we find sex, how sex operates in our life, operates in our relationships, how it operates in our society.

It accounts for it. Now, let's see. Let's draw four things out of here.

There's four things that Jesus is alluding to or saying that we can draw out of here. First of all, these four things were taught, there is such a thing as lust. We got to establish that.

There's such a thing as lust. And then we'll learn what it's not, what it is, and how it can be healed, okay? It's such a thing as lust, what it's not, what it is, how it's healed.

Now, first of all, there's such a thing, that seems obvious, but let's see what he's saying. You know, poor Jimmy Carter, our president Jimmy Carter, back in during his term in office at one point, he said, you know, perfectly sincerely, and honestly, sometimes he struggled with lust. And for the next three months, every Saturday night live sketch was about Jimmy Carter and his problem with lust.

Everybody laughed at it. He was, you know, mercilessly ridiculed, and it was largely, you know, the more sophisticated people who said, oh my goodness, struggling with lust, grow up, we have grown up, we're in control. You see, sex isn't something that we're struggling with.

We're in control. What he, Jesus is saying in this text is, oh, are you? How are you?

In the New York Times magazine back in a couple years ago, there was an article which was entitled, why nobody cheats anymore. Now, when you actually read the article, you'll see it's not really what it's saying, obviously, that nobody cheats anymore. However, it was a fascinating article, and here's what it was saying, he was saying there's an enormous, our culture is enormously conflicted about sex more than it was a 10 years ago, or 20 years ago even, and this is what it said.

On the one hand, the article said, there's still a very strong cultural message coming through the media throughout the strong, strong message, and that is this. The affirmation of sex between any two consenting adults is necessary for emotional and intellectual health. Anybody who doesn't affirm that, that any two consenting adults want to have sex, unless you affirm that, you're not enlightened, you're not emotionally, you're not grown up.

That's the one message. On the other hand, the article said, there is a growing movement of people who are actually saying, you know what? We have tried almost an entire generation of that approach, and it's creating all kinds of brokenness, and the whole article was about the fact that the New York Times article said there was a growing movement of counselors, a growing movement of books, actually the opinion polls on the part of the youngest people, people in their teens and in their 20s is moving, and this is basically, here's what the article said, we've tried a generation of this, and more and more people are recognizing that the result has been an enormous amount of disillusionment, bitterness, disease, broken families, ruined careers, and fatal obsessions, and there's more and more talk about, hey, monogamy was a great idea.

And here's what the article's saying, nobody, everybody stuck in the culture, because on the one hand there is a considerably more sobriety about the fact that we are not in control, that sex is really taking us. In fact, the bottom line of the article was this, it seems like no matter how hard you run after sex, you never seem to be able to actually catch it, it never delivers, it never gives you what you're after. On the other hand, no matter how fast you try to run away from sex, you never seem to be able to avoid it.

Now, what accounts for this? What accounts for the brokenness? What accounts for all the problems?

Jesus is actually saying what accounts for it is not that you have two, but the world has two high of you of sex, but two low of you of sex, he's saying you do not recognize its power, you're not respecting its power. This stuff about hell, which a lot of people say, oh my goodness, going to hell for less well, Jesus actually chooses, and it is a number of words he could use, but he chooses the word, one of the words for hell he chooses here is the word Gehenna. Now, well, Gehenna was a word for hell, but it was named after.

It comes from, Gehenna was the garbage dump outside of Jerusalem, and it was the place where you put your refuse, it's the place you put your garbage, it's the place where things that were rotting in decaying were put out there and they were burned. And that is an aspect of what hell is, that's the reason why it's there, so here's what Jesus is saying, Jesus is saying, unless you learn to deal with sex, it is so mysterious, it is so awesome, it is so unique, it is so untamable, he says, unless you do, and actually he's implying, because we have two low of you of sex because we don't respect its mystery and its awesomeness and its uncontrollability and its power, unless you get a handle on it, it's going to spread all sorts of decay and destruction in your life, your whole life is going to break apart. I'm going to set you on fire, things are going to fall apart, he says, this is serious, and the reason we have the problem is that we don't respect sex because we don't really see what it is, we have an improper view of it, now somebody is, all right, well, what is sex?

Well, here's what the world is going to tell you, especially today. The world is going to tell you, first of all, sex is just another appetite, that's not make a big deal about it, but that's just not true, it's not true, it was another article in New York Times magazine, which I saved, called Safe Sex Lies, and it was really interesting, it was about baby boomers who were in charge of MTV and charge of advertising agencies and charge of government agencies, and for the last three or four years you know that they have been sending safe sex messages, and the messages go like this, they say, oh, you young people coming out of college are in college right now, listen, the day of casual sex is over, the day of spontaneous sex is over, the day of frequent sex is over, it's too dangerous now, we can't do that anymore, it's got to be over. And the article was about the fact that a lot of the younger people who are in college, coming out of college, really resent this, and there were a number of letters that came in response to the article, which just proved the article was true, and I caught a couple of letters out, but the letters basically went like this, the letter said the younger people saying to baby boomer older people who are saying, you know, casual sex is out, frequent sex is out, spontaneous sex was out, and they said, wait a minute, you had yours, and now you're going to try to keep it from us, and this is what a couple of the letters said, real Frank, look, they said this is our right, if we want it dangerous or not, we'll take our chances, now that is not just another appetite, these folks are saying, you know, I've got to have this, okay, maybe it'll kill me, let me give you an appetite sugar, let's say you're diabetic, the doctors come to you and say to the diabetics, you know what, sugar is wonderful, you can't have any more, it'll kill you, now what do diabetics do, do they rise up and they say, you've had yours, and you're keeping me from having mine, and let's say sugar is my right, and if I die, it doesn't matter, I've got to have sure, I don't care, I don't want to live another 30 years, I don't care about that, now the reason they don't do that is because if it's really an appetite, no appetite is worth dying for, you just say, okay, I won't have sugar, that's not how people treat sex, sex is far more important, sex is far more powerful, people have got to have it, it gives them a whole lot of other things, this is much more than an appetite, and if you treat it like an appetite, you're going to be ambushed by it, or if people say, well, it's just another part of life, no it's not, no it's not, look at popular music, look at the songs and let's divide them into topics, okay?

How many songs are about your job? Listen, and people have never been more into their careers than they are now, but they're not singing about it, why are so many songs filled with bad lyrics, bad poetry, I'll just pick on my own generation, there's Batulla Clark, okay? Famous song, you know, my love is higher than the highest, brighter than the brightest stars that shine every night above, and there's nothing in this world that can ever change my love, remember?

Or Dan Fogelberg, longer than there have been fishes in the ocean, set a little newer, higher than any bird ever flew, longer than there have been stars in the heaven, I've been in love with you, why such bad lyrics? Here's the reason, you have to break into poetry, you have to talk about eternity when you're under the power of sexual love, it's not that way with a job, you're not singing songs about the job, but you have to break into this kind of language, if you're an atheist you have to talk about eternity, you've got to say my love will never change, you've got to say longer than there have been stars in the heaven, I've been in love with you, that's how you feel, why, you don't feel that way on the job, you don't sing about the job, this is not the same as any other part of life, this is not at all the same, we are driven, we are pulled, this is far more powerful than anything else, and it's going to spread out into all of your life unless you're going to deal with it, look at beauty, this culture, hey Jimmy Carter, we're in control, Jesus says, oh are we, look at beauty, look at importance of sexual attractiveness, those of you who are women know, especially you, that you're constantly being barraged by that and think of all the misery in your life over your looks, why, oh we're in control aren't we, no we're not, we're not in control, and man listen, this hasn't been talked about, I haven't even seen an article about it from what I can tell, because of the internet there's got to be 10 times more men that take to the pornography than there were 10 years ago, there's got to be, why, because of sexual attractiveness, because it's pressed on us, because it's so critical to us, because we're singing about it, because this is not just an appetite, this is not just another part of life, we are not in control, this has taken us apart, Jesus says unless you get control of it, unless you learn how to deal with it, it's going to spread out, spread disintegration into all parts of your life, your life's going to burn out, and therefore there is such a thing as lust, second point, okay then what is it, now first of all I think what we learn here is what it's not, and what it's not is actually, you know I say well where does it say what it's not, well it's, what it doesn't say, it tells us what it's not, Jesus when he uses this word, very important word, we're going to look at it positively first negatively, and he says anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already, what does it mean to look lustfully, now there's some perfectly decent words he could have used, that mean sexual desire, but he didn't say that, and here's my, here's that, this point, the point is, Jesus and the Bible does not define sex as sex apart me lust, the Bible does not define lust as sexual desire, doesn't define sexual lust as sexual desire, it's not the same thing, Jesus is not saying sexual desire, or even strong sexual desire, or just a rejoicing in, sexuality is wrong, he wouldn't say that, he doesn't say that, because the Bible doesn't say that, in fact the Bible's attitude towards sex is one of such bare face, exuberant, direct, rejoicing in the glory of sexual pleasure that it even makes New Yorkers blush, I've seen it happen and maybe I'll try, I'll try to prove it to you right now, for example, go back to the old, look, go back to the beginning, first chapter, Genesis 1, what are we told, God made male and female, he made the male, what's that mean, God invented sex, first chapter, and he does a benediction, he says, and it was good, first chapter, God invented sex and does a benediction on it, but that's not all, second chapter, what do we see, God brings Eve to Adam, and what does he say, he says, at last, bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh, but now get this, when Adam sees Eve, he breaks into poetry, it's the first poetic couplet, and the Bible's really saying exactly what we already said, is the reason why we have such so much bad poetry, 99% of people are bad poets, but we have to do poetry when it comes to sex, and what we have in the second chapter is this, naked Adam singing rapturous songs of love to negative in the presence of God, and that's chapter 2, you know Martin Luther, it made an interesting point about this, the Christian understanding of the body is so dog on positive, he says, Jesus Christ who was utterly perfect had a body, and the devil who was utterly imperfect doesn't have one, and this whole idea that sin is bodily, or the body is sinful, and drags us down, and the spiritual is good, and the body is bad, but how do you explain that? The only perfect man who ever lived most perfect being in history had a body, and the most imperfect being in history doesn't have one, but here take a look at a place called the Song of Solomon, Song of Solomon is a extended love song, really a celebration of sexual love between a husband and a wife, and it's attitude, sort of sexuality, well just let's look at it.

In chapter 5, pardon me in chapter 7, we see the husband looking at his wife who's coming to him for sex, is coming to him for love making, and as she comes to him, he looks at her naked and he says, your stature is like that of a palm tree, and your breasts are like clusters of fruit, I will climb the palm tree, and it will take hold of the fruit. So right there in the Bible, you've got a very vivid statement, a man singing for joy about taking hold of his wife's breasts, there it is in the Bible, no problem, but on the other hand in chapter 7, pardon me in chapter 5, we see the other side, we see a wife looking at her husband as he comes to her at ready for love making, he's naked, and this is what she says, she says, my lover, his hair is wavy and black as a raven, his lips are like lilies dripping with myrrh, his bodies like a polished ivory tusk decorated with jewels, his mouth of sweetness itself, this is my lover, and this is my friend. He said, well that's not all that vivid, oh yes, of course it is, a noted Old Testament professor who knows Hebrew, and I know him too, and he also wrote a book on this, and let me quote him from the book, he says, when she describes her husband's body as polished ivory tusk, most biblical translators of Hebrew cannot bring themselves to bring forth the obvious meaning in the translation, but the tusk of ivory that she is looking at is a loving description of her husband's erect penis, after all this is a prelude to lovemaking, there is here no shy shamed mechanical movement under the sheets, rather the two stand before each other aroused feeling no shame, but only joy in each other's sexuality, this is bare face rejoicing and sexual joy, I'm not doing this for shock value besides that, I didn't say it, I was just quoting this Old Testament scholar, but what I am trying to say is this, let's put this all together, let's put this all together, what we just said in that point in this point so we can move on, the Bible on the one hand says, if you say follow your passions wherever they point, you are not respecting the power of sex, you have too low of you, but on the other hand, if you're prudish, say if you're prudish and you say oh sex is defiling and kind of dirty and so on, you're not respecting the goodness of sex, see, and therefore you still have too low of you of sex, either the prudish view, which is sex is bad, squelch your passions, or the pagan view which is sex is just an appetite, you know just follow your passions, both are too low of you of sex, once these doesn't respect the power of sex, one doesn't respect the goodness of sex, but instead Christianity and Jesus doesn't say squelch your passions, my goodness, he couldn't be saying, he doesn't say that, he has every opportunity right here to say sexual desire, do not look with a woman with any sexual desire, that's not what she's that's not what he's saying, he doesn't say don't look at a woman and admire her sexual beauty, doesn't say that, he could have, there's ways he could have said that, because the Bible does not equate lust with sexual desire, it likes sexual desire, God invented sexual desire, but the Bible does not say squelch your passions, nor does it say follow your passions, it says channel them, and that leads us to the third point, okay sexual desire, if lust is not sexual desire, what is it, and the text tells us two things, two very important things to know, what is lust, it's impersonal desire and it's inordinate desire, now that is definitely here because first of all, let's talk about what I mean by impersonal desire, he says you have heard it was said, do not commit adultery, but I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully, now let's stop, one of the things that is, it's easy to miss when you're just reading this little piece, easy to miss this, back in the top of the chapter, Jesus says your righteousness must exceed the righteousness of religious people, remember that I'm talking about that several weeks ago, Jesus says your righteousness, that means your way of living as Christians has to exceed that of the teachers of the law, has to exceed that of the religious leaders of religion, then immediately as soon as he says that it immediately goes into six sections in which he says you've heard it said but I say, you've heard it said don't not don't murder but I say don't even resent, you've heard it said an eye for an eye and I say love your enemies, you've heard it said and he goes actually even in the chapter six or he's contrasting a narrow moralistic religious view of something with his view, now therefore in the beginning he says when you've heard it said do not commit adultery he's thinking of religious people and he's saying you've heard it said as long as if you're married you don't cheat on your wife that's then you obey the sex ethic and Jesus says but he says I am going to I'm I'm I'm going to give you a more comprehensive understanding I'm going to open this up are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian

give that's gospel on life.com slash give now here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching and what he says is but i tell you anyone who looks at a woman by the way this is works both ways any woman who looks at a man any man who looks at a woman here's the point though he doesn't say anyone who looks at another woman so he's not talking just to married people not saying to married men you look at another woman nor is he saying another wife or a wife a lot of people think well if long as you don't cheat on your spouse and as long as you don't cheat with somebody who's married to someone else okay she says no he says if you want sex with someone to whom you're not married one more time if you want to be physically one with someone with whom you're not personally one if you want to be physically naked and vulnerable with somebody who you are not willing to be personally and legally and economically and totally vulnerable naked it says what you're doing is you are bringing into your soul something that will lead to disintegration fire will fall apart now put it this way the bible says sex is an integrative act and that means simply this tells why prudishness and paganism is wrong can I tell you why a prudish person is someone who says let's have a platonic relationship let's not get sex involved you see because the spiritual is good and the body is bad they are splitting a soul from body they're separating the soul from the body you see but the pagan view is this the pagan view is look I would like to have sex with you but I want to get married to you and here's what you mean I want to be physically one with you I want you to be vulnerable to me I want you to completely trust me physically but I want to hold on my own life what I want you to do you see at this point is think of what Jesus is saying if you don't marry somebody if you say I would like to have sex with you but I don't want to marry you what you're saying is I want to keep I want to be independent I want I want to keep my options open I want to in other words I want to keep control of my life I don't want to give you myself to you personally I want to give myself to you only physically I want you to give yourself to me physically but I don't want to trust my whole self to you which is also a splitting of body and soul I want to give the body oneness but not the soul oneness not the whole person oneness not the whole life oneness and so what's really weird is prudishness and paganism in their attitude towards sex they look so different they hate each other they to announce each other they write articles against each other they're utterly the same they will not see sex as an integrative act they will not see the importance of keeping those things together and totally together that's the reason why let's see if we can put it this way it is so critical for us to understand this if you actually what I probably should do is backtrack no better yet here I'll tell you what I can do let me read you this quote from John white John white's a Christian psychiatrist and actually when you read when you listen to this I can tell you this actually explains my sex life he says immediate erotic thrill is the most superficial benefit of the sex act the bodily exposure that arouses and accompanies sex can be profoundly symbolic and powerfully healing it is healing if it's the concrete sign of what is happening in the whole relationship the uncovering of my inner self the uncover of my of my deepest fears and yearnings if I do that and as I tenderly look on the body of another and as I experience what is it is to feel the tenderness of another's caress then the one who accepts and touches my most intimate body and caresses it with tenderness caresses awesomite in most being or so it seems when all is right so it only makes sense that sexual relations be confined to marriage from mutual disclosure and tender acceptance is not the activity of a moment but the delicate fabric of a lifetimes weaving each time sex brings from casual encounter physical disclosure and touching without personal disclosing and touching some of its life giving and healing nature is destroyed see now what he's saying is if when someone caresses and accepts my most intimate part of my body if at the very same time in the relationship that same person is being utterly vulnerable to me and I'm being overly vulnerable to that person and we are doing this in our relationship he says then there's an enormous powerful healing that goes on in other words the vulnerable the physical vulnerability is a result of the relational vulnerability but on the other hand the physical vulnerability is also a stimulus to relational vulnerability and when the reason I said it explains my sex life is this if you really believe this biblical understanding of sex sex gets better and better and better even when your body is getting uglier and uglier as time goes on because you see as he says sex really becomes there is almost a sacrament it's a sign of an invisible reality God invented sex as one way as a way for one person to say another person I belong completely and exclusively to you then it's a then it is a sign of an invisible reality but if you use it in any other way it actually undoes its power to cement and to and to renew your commitment and therefore now therefore lust is impersonal now why do I say that it's very simple see as Lewis says unless you're willing to make a complete personal commitment to somebody from whom you're asking a complete bodily commitment then you're really not after that person you really don't want that person you want an experience and that person's unnecessary commodity and you're dehumanizing that person no matter all the hearts all the flowers doesn't matter what you say you're dehumanizing that person you're using that person they're using you but it's impersonal so first of all he's saying anyone who looks on a woman you know okay therefore it's impersonal but the second lust is not just impersonal desire it's inordinate desire and some of you if you come to redeem her for while you know something about this the word that Jesus uses for lust here is the word that's almost never used with sex in fact I went through the 62 times in the New Testament that it's used only twice can I tell that it's used for sex it's not usually used for sex it's the word epitomea it's the word that means literally an inordinate desire and over desire and a dollar-trust desire this is a word that means that takes something good and to try to get from it what you can only get from God and if that's his definition of lust that explains a lot that explains why we that's the reason why we're willing to die for this that's the reason why we feel like we can't live with this we don't want to get married because but we've got to have it it explains the reason why we're so driven by it because he says we're trying to get something out of it that only God can give now here's what's scary about this it's very very scary in many ways first of all it's scary because it's it's something that a conservative people traditional value people can do of course we have plenty of examples of people who don't believe in God using sex in a sense as a kind of religion a Malcolm Mugridge said that sex is the mysterious of the naturalist and there's all sorts of examples I can give you of people who really don't believe in God at all but admit admit that it's sex is the thing that makes them feel like there really is meaning in life sex is the thing that really gives them a sense of the cosmic sex is the thing that really feels apocalyptic but if what Jesus Christ is saying is right and here's the thing you can be in a major traditional value you can be externally like the Pharisees completely ethical sexually and yet in your heart you say if somebody would love me if I have this perfect little Christian family and if I have the you know the perfect spouse and a perfect marriage and a perfect children if all that happens then finally I'll know I'm somebody then I'll be happy and Jesus says there is nobody who's going if you are married and that's your view there's problems in your marriage because of it and if you're not married it could be one of the reasons why because you see what you're saying is if I just get this if I get a beautiful person who thinks I'm beautiful and you're going to be looking for the most beautiful person and you may looking for someone who can find you perfectly you know attractive and loves you completely and there isn't anybody like that except the one who is the real lover of your soul.

Jesus is actually saying until God is the lover of your soul you're not going to be fit to be a lover of anybody else you're either you're going to be trying to get out of romantic love that which only God can give you you're going to be trying to get the self acceptance out of it you're going to be because see Jesus is pointing here and saying here's the problem what we do with sex is we think this will heal us finally we'll be somebody finally we'll have the security it's a really beautiful person thinks I'm beautiful then I'll know I'm somebody and Jesus is saying there's only one person beautiful enough there's only one person who can find you and love you unconditionally enough to satisfy what your heart needs and if you look at anybody else and you try to get that out of them your life is going to be distorted by lust lust inordinate desire in a sense sex is a signpost pointing to God and you're not supposed to sit under a signpost my cat by the way whenever you point to him and he say you know I say look at my cat I said go over there or look at that what she always does I go like this and she comes up and she sniffs the finger just like that and just stares at it said no no no this means we're all like that God says sex is a signpost it's pointing beyond itself unless you see what it's pointing to you're going to it's you're going to make a mess of your life unless you get the kind of that kind of satisfaction all right well then lastly how then if that's what lust is if lust is impersonal desire if love is idolatrous in ordinate desire then how can it be healed well as a principle and a practice here's the principle first of all the principle is this Jesus Christ says the number places I'm the bridegroom put an amazing statement he says he he of course he says I'm the king but if he's just the king if he only the king you know what goes on here if he's only the king then what that means is I'm trying to obey him and as long as you're just trying to obey him and as long as you're in a sense trying to hoping that if I live a good enough life you'll accept me he can't you can't ever be confident that he's looking at you and finding you beautiful only the gospel only the gospel it says it's not me giving God a righteousness and then he owes me but God through Jesus Christ who lived the life I should have lived died to death I should have died Jesus Christ gives me a righteousness that I received by faith and the moment I become a Christian I'm beautiful in his sight unless you believe in the gospel Jesus might be your king he might be your your forgiver he might be your example he might be all kinds of things but he won't be your lover because you see the bridegroom sits at the bottom of the aisle and down comes the bride to see him and the bridegroom looks at the bride and finds her absolutely radiant and beautiful do you believe God believes that about you to the degree you experience that to that degree you'll understand and deal with sex it won't run your life it won't scare to death if you put on some weight it will make you embarrassed if you're married it won't make you crush your spouse under his or under your expectations for him or her when you do get married and until he's the lover of your soul there's going to be fire in your life and it'll be it'll be sex there's going to be disintegration there's going to be falling apart you've got to get that straight only he has really become vulnerable for us he was stripped naked on the cross only he is completely committed to you and love you perfectly only he is infinitely beautiful only the way in which he beholds you is going to really satisfy your life he's the only one who literally can say longer than they've been stars up in the heaven I've been in love with you everybody else who says that to no matter how great it feels is lying he's the only one can say my love is deeper than the ocean I invented the ocean he's the only one can say my love is is is bigger than the sky he's the only one can say and nothing in this world will ever change my love everybody else who says that to you is a liar they mean well they can't help it they're under the power of the signpost they're under the power of sex sex is a signpost it makes you feel in the presence of the infant it makes you feel that there really is truth and beauty and you know it makes you believe all that of course that's why they're saying that they're lying he's the only one that can do that you get that straight then the practical somebody's going to say please don't leave here without telling me something practical about lust okay I'll tell you do you think do you think it's an accident that he says pluck out your eye and cut off your hand is that just being poetic no the eye and the hand are two different things first of all the eyes how you view things and the eye has much to do if you want to deal with lust you have got to learn you can't just simply work on the will you can't just say I won't I won't I won't I won't you know you know you can't do the elicit thing a chain yourself to the mast you know tell people just a row and row and row don't listen to me now yet that's not that's not enough you've got to change your way of viewing things when potifers wife came after Joseph back in Genesis chapter 39 she says come lie with me what does he say he says think of what your husband has done for me think of what God has done for me I cannot do this wicked thing now here's what he did he looked at it in its true colors and if you want to ever get over lust one of the things you're going to have to do is you're going to when it begins to happen you have to think about you have to say this is worship I am seeking God I am seeking closure I'm seeking acceptance I'm seeking beauty this will never give it to me never what am I doing this is like I'm like a man I'm using the man here because I think a lot of you who need to hear this are men I'm like a man who's thirsty and I'm eating pretzels to deal with it so and you and you in a sense change the way you look at it but on the other hand there's the hand and the hand means you do have to be concerned about your behavior you do have to be concerned about where you are that means avoid place of temptation you do have to worry about your behavior you do have to not put yourself in the way of temptation if you only think behaviorally and if you don't work on your thinking cognitively you're not you're going to fail on the other hand if you only work on cognitive and you don't take yourself out of the way of temptation you're going to fail too talk out the eye cut off the hand or the fire will spread to everything now final application three number one don't forget we say every week the sermon on the mount is not written to individuals so much it's written to a community the sermon on the mount is basically trying to say as a community we should live like this and I would like you to think for a second of this intern of this sermon and next week's sermon which is on money the early church was a counter culture it was strikingly different from the pagan society around it in this way the pagan society was stingy with its money and promiscuous with its body see a pagan gave nobody their money practically but gave everybody their body and the Christians came along and they gave practically nobody their body because they had believed in integrity insects and they gave very almost everybody their money they were promiscuous with their money and self-control with their body where the pagans were promiscuous with their body and and way too self-control with their money and as a result they look utterly different historians will tell you of course that one of the reasons that Christianity spread like crazy is think about this for a second which approach to money and sex is going to create good neighborhoods which approach to money and sex is going to help the social fabric which approach to money is listen which society would a kid want to grow up in think about your own life one of the reasons that women just flock by the way into Christianity away from paganism was because they understood it as very pro women of course so listen we're not talking just about individuals here are we the kind of community in a place like New York which is very pagan in its attitude toward money and sex do we look different are we just like they are are we holding on to our money are we spreading around our body number one number two if you're single keep this in mind if Jesus is the lover of your soul some of you won't be as scared to move out and get married one of the reasons why some of you've been scared to get married is because you're looking for an ideal a perfectly beautiful person that's why you're just ruling out people that aren't perfectly beautiful and somebody who loves you perfectly you're never going to get married that way and one of the reasons why is because what you it's lust you're looking to other people do what only Jesus can do Jesus is the only perfectly beautiful lover of your soul so here's what I suggest find somebody else who has Jesus really clearly as a lover of his or her soul get to know them and start that lifetime work that the John white was talking about of weaving your life together and there's others of you who love to get married so I'm not afraid of I'm afraid of I'm just unhappy why am I still unmarried and the best the best thing to remember is if Jesus is the lover of your soul as difficult as it's going to be it'll probably be bearable because it really only his arms I mean this is a dirty little secret most people are either unmarried or unhappily married I think so from somebody who's happily married let me just tell you it's never enough other happily married people will tell you even when your marriage is great it's not will satisfy your soul all the way to the bottom there's only one kiss that will there's only one set of arms that will there's only one marriage supper that will then lastly if you're married here's this quick suggestion Jesus is the bridegroom men keep this in mind you will never be a good groom to your wife unless you're first a good bride to Jesus when Jesus is on the bridegroom he's trying to get men under control you know one of the reasons why women don't trust us guys because they have got very good reasons we tend to be tyrannical we tend to be insensitive and you know why you know why we're very very bad husbands in many cases because we've never been wise and Jesus says I want you to be my wife he's I want you I want you to come under my power I want you to submit to me I want you to learn from me and until you're a good groom to him a good wife to him you'll never be a good husband to any woman let him be the bridegroom until he's the lover of your soul you're not going to be ready to love anybody else's and then secondly wives women feminists are basically right about this there's a strong tendency in this culture for you to think I'm only somebody if I've got a man you know feminists and men are not your salvation now what do they say what do they say you should do well they say career or something else and Jesus says you're go from one addiction to another he says I got something better he says I'm your bridegroom not your husband and you'll be a lousy bride to him unless you're a great bride for me who would have ever thought Christianity up nobody thought it up has to be true let's pray we pray Father that you would make us a community and what sexuality is back where it should be sex is like fire in the fireplace unbelievable warmth power food but help us to keep it in the fireplace when spreads out on the rug everything goes up the only way that will be true is if we become a community in which of people who are have you as a lover of our souls Jesus Christ because of what you've done for us only those of us who have understood the gospel believe and pray that that after sexes be mystified how we can really enjoy our own sexuality and we pray Lord that you would lead many single people here want to be married into marriage we pray that you would lead many married people into better marriages we pray that you would keep us from the idolatry of romance and of beauty and we pray that the world would look inside and say I cannot believe what a amazing place where people are not prudes but sex is no longer running their lives for our Lord make us a community like that we pray in Jesus name amen thanks for listening to today's teaching it's our prayer that you were encouraged by it and that it helps you apply the gospel to your life for more helpful
