Today on the podcast, Tim Keller helps us  understand how the Gospel frees us to have hope and joy in our vocations. Now the scripture this morning is from Luke's Gospel chapter 6 verses 1 through 11. One Sabbath, Jesus was going through the grain fields and his disciples began to pick some heads  of grain, rub them in their hands and ate the kernels. Some of the Pharisees asked,  why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath? Jesus answered them,  have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?

He entered the house of God and taking the consecrated bread, he ate what is lawful only for  priests to eat, and he also gave some to his companions. Then Jesus said to them,  the son of man is Lord of the Sabbath. On another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching  and a man was there whose right hand was shriveled. The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were  looking for a reason to accuse Jesus so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath. But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled hand,  get up and stand in front of everyone.

So he got up and stood there. Then Jesus said to them,  I ask you which is lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil to save life or to destroy it. He looked around at them all and then said to the man, stretch out your hand. He did so and his  hand was completely restored, but they were furious and began to discuss with one another what they  might do to Jesus. This is God's word.

We're looking at the book of Luke and the life of Jesus  in the book of Luke. For a number of weeks we've been looking at Jesus' teaching about what it  means to follow him, what it means to be is disciple and of course Jesus is essentially taking  the gospel, who he is, what he did. And he's saying his disciples are people who apply the gospel  to absolutely every single area of life. And today we come to an area that is referred to. It's  covered in the fourth commandment of the Ten Commandments.

It's in Exodus 20. Six days you shall  labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord, your God. On it you  shall not do any work for on the seventh day the Lord rested. Sabbath rests. Now I know that  that we all have somewhat different relationships to work.

There are people here for example who are out of  work and would love to have more work. There are people here who in general have said to me that they  have a problem with work with discipline, but by and large in New York City, in the middle of New York  City, the biggest problem we have, one of the biggest problems we have is Sabbath rest, the discipline of  the getting of Sabbath rest. Why do we need it? Where do we get it? How do we do it?

Why do we need it? Where do we get it? How do we do it? It's all here. First of all, why do we need it?

Look at verse 1-2. Jesus and His disciples were going through a field on a Sabbath day,  and they picked some heads of grain, rubbed them in their hands to eat the kernels,  and they were condemned. They were accused of breaking the Sabbath by the Pharisees, and that's  because reaping grain was one of the 39 forms of work that was forbidden on the Sabbath day by the  halaka at the time, which is the religious regulations. As soon as you hear that, this was breaking  the Sabbath to just take the heads off of grain and rub them in your hands and get the kernels out  and eat them. Right away we say, oh, we say how legalistic, how moralistic, all those rules, how  awful.

We turn up our nose at it, but notice Jesus' response is not the Son of Man has come to do  away with the Sabbath, or to get us beyond all this. That's not what he says. He says the Son of  Man is Lord of the Sabbath, and we'll get to that in a second, but it means at least this, that I'm  all about the Sabbath. The Sabbath is what I'm all about, which means here's what we learn to start with. The most workaholic culture in the history of the world, it's us, dare not, turn up its nose at any  effort, even misguided efforts, to give to people one of the things most crucial to making life even  human, which is rest.

Judas Schulovitz, who is a writer for the New York Times magazine, probably in  New York Times book review, she wrote an article in New York Times magazine just this last month in  the first week of March called Bring Back the Sabbath, and she says this. First of all, she gives  a little bit of background on herself. She says she was raised probably in New York, I'm not sure,  but she was raised in a religious community at a synagogue, but like the average professional  secular New Yorker, she resisted and basically moved away from her religious upbringing, and then she  began to experience a phenomenon. Here's how she describes it. She says my mood would darken  every weekend.

Until by Saturday afternoon, I'd be unresponsive and morose. My normal routine, which  involved brunch with friends, made me feel impossibly restless. Then I began to do something that,  as a teenager, profoundly put off by her religious education, I could never have imagined ever  wanting to do. I began dropping in on a nearby synagogue. Finally, I developed a theory for my  condition.

If formerly people suffered from the Sabbath, which means all the regulations,  I now was suffering from the lack thereof. There is ample evidence that our relationship to work  is out of whack. Let me argue on behalf of an institution that has kept work of holism and  reasonable check for thousands of years. Most people mistakenly believe that all you have to do to  stop working is to not work. But the inventors of the Sabbath understood that it was a much more  complicated undertaking.

You cannot downshift casually and easily. This is why the Puritan and Jewish  Sabbaths were so exactly intentional. The rules did not exist to torture the faithful. Interrupting the ceaseless round of striving requires a surprisingly strenuous act of the will. One that has to be bolstered by habit, as well as by social sanction.

And what she's saying is  simply this. In spite of the fact she knows about, she recognizes the potential for abuse. Our relationship to work as a society is so seriously out of whack. That anyone who thinks that you're going to be able to get rested by simply knocking off  whenever you feel tired is hopelessly naive. The ability to rest, deeply rest, is a life or death  thing.

No one can do without it. But it is not natural. It is not simple. It is absolutely  difficult. And it takes an enormous amount of discipline and practice.

That's what she's saying. Now why would that be? Why would it be so hard? Well, first of all, we have to look at our modern  situation. I'll do that briefly.

The modern situation means that the eternal human need for rest  is enormously aggravated. Let me give you four trends. A, B, C, D, trends. Trend 1, A, excuse me,  an A trend, is the fact that more and more, at least in Western culture, jobs are insecure. The idea of jobs, hold departments.

If they don't perform, if they don't turn profit, they're  eliminated. Job security has never been a culture. Never been a place where job security was so bad. I don't think. Number two, these are the same big things and kind of in nut shells here.

There's been a lot of research done on the fact that where it used to be, the people making  the money at the top of a company, you used to make maybe 10 or 20 times with people at the  bottom of the company made. Now it's more like 100 to 200 times. And partly as a result of this,  to some degree, increasingly, people who make large amounts of money are expected  to put in enormous numbers of hours. It's just expected. And if you don't want to do it,  there's a line behind you.

Whereas people on the bottom are having to take multiple jobs. So  everybody's overworked as a matter where you are on the scale. In order to make ends meet,  they have to take multiple jobs. That's B, C, technology, A technology. You can work anywhere.

Which means, now, we work everywhere. It means that you can't stop work from spilling out  into every nook and crane of your life. And that's C and D. The fourth trend, and this is a little  more complex. Cultural analysts have said, and there's pretty much universal agreement on this,  that whereas traditional societies said, you got your meaning in life through your family.

You got your meaning in life through family. And through basically fulfilling a fairly prescribed  social role, either as a mother or father or brother or sister, husband or wife or son or daughter. And work wasn't as important in a situation like that. You just need to find a way to make a living  because family was what everything was about. But we are the first culture in history that says,  you define yourself by deciding what you want to be and attaining it.

And then you have significance,  which means that work, there's never been more psychological and social and emotional  pressure on work to be either fulfilling or at least lucrative. There's never been a culture  like that, which means A, B, C, D, A, B and C, you know, mean that we are more desperately in  need of rest than we ever have less time for rest than ever. And D means we emotionally on the  inside have less ability to rest and relax than we anyone ever has had, any cultures ever had. But as bad as that is, as aggravating as the modern situation is, the Sabbath is an ancient practice  because there is an abiding human problem that has always been there. The Sabbath is obviously not  a response to modern hecticness.

There's something that's already been there and what is that  thing that's already been down there? There's something else that needs to be addressed by Sabbath. And Judith Schulovitz, and this is just a terrific article. She understands what that deeper thing is  when she says, quote, when the Sabbath was still sacred, not only did drudgery give way to festivity  and family gatherings and occasional worship, but the machinery of self-censorship shut down too,  stilling the eternal inner murmur of self-reproach. The eternal inner murmur of self-reproach.

The inner machinery, now what is she talking about there? Sleep experts know that in order to be restored,  you don't just need amount of sleep, but depth of sleep, what they call  REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. And of course, they say, I think that only happens after certain  period of time. In other words, if you would take eight, one hour naps or something like that,  and you say, I slept for eight hours, the next day, you would be absolutely just fatigued  because you have to, I think sleep a certain period of time before, you go into deep sleep,  rapid eye movement sleep. And so it's not just so much amount of sleep, it's the depth of sleep  that you need, and hear what she's saying, and what I'm saying is, there is, on the one hand,  your external work, and you do need rest from physical exertion, but there is a deeper problem.

There is a work underneath the work. There is an eternal inner murmur. There is an inner machinery of self-censorship. What does she mean by that? It's not guilt.

It's the need to prove yourself to yourself, to others, and that work  makes the other kinds of work incredibly weary. That's what brings the wearyness. And that work, which is very, very difficult, you're always trying to prove yourself, you're trying  to make sure that you, you know, that work, it's never enough. You're never, it's never enough. And because of that, you see, that's rapid eye movement, deep rest of the soul  that you've got to have, or else all the vacations, number one, help.

If you take your vacations, you knock off, but you're not able to deal with that,  you're not able to get that deeper rest, able to get that spiritual rest,  you're going to be in fatigue all the time. So under the big rest, under the physical rest,  as a need for deep spiritual rest. For example, you know, the only good rocky movie, the first one,  the question comes to rocky, you know, why are you driven? Why are you doing all this performance? You know, why are you, you know, why are those trumpets blazing as you run through the streets  of Little Italy and Philadelphia and go up the art museum steps?

Why are you working so hard? And his answer was, I want to go the distance, then I'll know I'm not a bum. So our hero is being driven by the eternal inner murmur of self-reproach. The inner machinery. That's why he's working so hard.

That's why he makes it to the top, et cetera. That's why he's going to burn out. That's why the other movies are going to be terrible. There is a deep need for a deep soul rest, without which physical rest is not going to help you. So we need Sabbath rest.

We've never needed it more than we do now, but we need it. So that's why  we need it. Number one, number two, where do we get it? Now let's look at what Jesus says. They say he's violating the Sabbath and how does he respond?

Well, he says,  have you ever read that what David did when he and his companions were hungry? He entered the house of God and taken the consecrated bread. He ate what is lawful for only  priest to eat, and then he gave some to his companions. Now what's interesting here is Jesus takes  an incident from 1 Samuel 21, where we're told that David, when he was on run for his life, he was  running for his life. He went through the tabernacle, and in the tabernacle, there is the place where  the show bread, which was the bread of the presence.

It was in the holy place. In the tabernacle was  part of the Sabbath worship, and you are not allowed to eat it. It was part of the worship,  and David ate it. Of course, as Jesus implies, he was never condemned for it. God never said  it was anything wrong with what he did.

He was never condemned for it at all. Now Jesus is inviting  us to think out the implications of that. If the Sabbath and worship regulations can be set aside  in a pinch, but on the other hand, if there's absolutely no place anywhere in the Bible, where the  moral law can be set aside in a pinch. There's no place where God says, well, you were in a hurry,  so committing adultery is all right, worshiping an idol is all right, stealing, robbing, armed  robbery. That was all right.

You know you were in trouble. You were in, no, if there's no place  ever where the moral law is set aside in a pinch, but the Sabbath and the ceremonial and the  worship regulations are set aside in a pinch. What does this mean? Think of the reasoning. It means that they are provisional, meaning that means they are temporary,  meaning that they will end when something comes along that makes them obsolete to which they point.

And what would that be? He says, it's very, very next verse. Then Jesus says to them, assuming that  they are thinking along these lines, I am Lord of the Sabbath, which is astounding. Let's think  about what he's saying. He's saying actually, more things than I'm going to be able to open up  in this sermon, but he's saying this.

I am the one that the Sabbath regulations all pointed to. I can give you the deep rest of the soul that you most need. I am the Lord of rest. Jesus, I am  the Lord of rest. And you know what this means, two ways.

If you want rest, you have to go to him. And if you think you've gone to him, but you don't have any rest, you still don't know what you have. You still haven't taken hold of what you have. You still haven't understood what you have. Now, how and why?

How is he the Lord of rest and why? All right. Let me take you to three  couple passages, a couple of other verses that are important. What does this mean that he's Lord  of rest? What does it mean to give you rest?

First of all, let's go to the original verse in the  Bible about this. You go all the way back to Genesis 1, the end of Genesis 1, the beginning of Genesis 2,  and God has just finished creating the world. And this is what we read. And God saw that all he had  created, pardon me, and God saw that all he had made, it was good. And God finished the work he had  been doing so that on the seventh day, he rested from his work.

God rested seventh day, right? But what do you mean God rested? Was he tired? God can't be tired. And if God can't be tired,  what in the world does it mean he's rested?

You and I can define rest as getting over being tired. What does it mean that God rested if he wasn't tired? And here's the answer. One of the things that's so neat about the creation account is every time God makes something  before he moves on to something else, he says something over and over and over again. You know what  it is?

He makes something and he looks at it and he says, that's good. That was good. Then he  makes something else and he says, that's good. And then when he gets to the very end, it's the  which I just read. He looks at all of it and he says, very good.

And that's what it means to rest. To be utterly satisfied with what's been done. To be utterly satisfied. That's the only way you can  walk away. It's the only way you can stop.

The only way you can put your doing down is if you're  absolutely satisfied with the doing. That's good. That is good. Now you can rest. Now you can relax.

So you see, the definition of resting is to be utterly satisfied with what was done. Secondly,  second verse. Scroll forward, Hebrews chapter 4 is talking about the gospel. The Hebrews writer  is talking to Christians about what it means to believe in Jesus. And as he's talking about the  gospel and believing in Jesus, suddenly he says this, there remains then a rest for the people of  God.

For anyone who through the gospel enters God's rest, rest from his own work just as God  rested from his. Now this is an amazing statement. What does it mean to become a Christian? I mean,  there's a whole lot of ways of putting it. And the reason you need every different way is because  you need them all to understand the richness of it.

To become a Christian is someone who's  able to look at your work the way God looked at his, able to look at your life the way God looked  at his. You're being told here that through Jesus Christ, you can look at your life. You can  look at yourself and say, it's absolutely satisfying. It's absolutely good. There's nothing else  that needs to be done.

It is good. All the work that I need to do is finished. It's estimated that most of us spend half of our waking hours at work. How does the wisdom of the  Bible apply to our careers? In other words, how can our work connect with God's work and how can  our vocations be more emotional?

In his book, Every Good and Devere, Tim Keller draws from decades of  teaching on vocation and calling to show you how to find true joy in your work as you serve God and  others. The book offers surprising insights into how a Christian perspective on work can serve as  the foundation for a thriving career and a balanced personal life. Every good endeavor is our thank you  for your gift to help gospel and life share Christ's love with more people around the world. Just visit  gospelandlife.com slash give.

How could that be? How is that possible? But you see, look,  Judas Schulovitz, one more time. I'm going to go back to her one more time because it's such a great  article. She gives us insight and she puts it like this.

And this is great. She says, not even our  most pardon me, not even our group leisure activities can do for us what the Sabbath rituals could  once be counted on to do. Hear that? She says, not enough for you to just knock off and go on out  there and do all your leisure activity. That's not going to give you the rest from the eternal inner  murmur and inner machinery.

Oh no. She says, she says, not even our group, group leisure activities  can do for us what Sabbath rituals could once be counted to do because religious rituals do not  exist simply to promote togetherness. They are designed to convey to us a story about who  we are. The story told by the Sabbath is of creation. God rested and we rest in order to  honor the image of the divine in us to remind us that there's more to us than our work.

Now she  to a great degree has discerned exactly what the Hebrews writers trying to say. Remember we said there's a work underneath as well as the work up here. There's a physical work  but the thing that makes things really worry, really weary is not the physical work because  listen, you go back into the book of Genesis, you go back to Paradise, go to the Garden of Eden and  there was work there. In other words, what really is there are problems is not the presence of work,  it's the absence of deep rest. So there's the external work but then there's the work down here.

What is that? And she knows what it is. She already talked about it. She called the eternal  inner murmur a self approach but here's what it is. It's trying to know who you are.

It's trying to show to other people and to yourself, I know I'm somebody important or something  to me, something important. And you do it through the doing. Every human being does it. Religious  people say if I'm really good and if I do many, many good works, God will bless me. Secular people though, their hearts operate on the very same basis, the very same basis.

They don't believe in God or believe in law or the Bible or anything but they have set their  standards and their entire self-image rests on meeting those standards and living up to those goals. That's the work, under the work. Always having to prove yourself, always having to assure  yourself that you're somebody important. But that work is never finished. Never finished.

It's never over. It's never enough. You never can look under those circumstances that you're doing  and say, it's good. Maybe one day occasionally, but what about tomorrow? There's always tomorrow.

You can never say what God said and see what is rest. To be able to look and say, I am satisfied. It is good. It is finished. But the Hebrews writer says,  through Jesus and only through Jesus, can you get this rest.

Jesus is the one who said,  come unto me, O ye who labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon me for I am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls. From my burden is easy. My yoke is easy and my burden is light. What he's saying is,  everybody's serving something.

Everybody's trying to get an identity out of something. But only if you make me the meaning of your life will you get absolute rest. Only through me will  you be able to look at yourself, look at your work, look at everything and say it's finished. Everything is necessary that to be done has been done. It is good.

How is that possible? Here's how it's possible. How's that possible through Jesus? Here's how it's possible. Look at  the last verse.

There's a great irony in this verse. You have to put verse 11 together with verse 5. When they were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus. Now why were they so furious? Do you know what it means when he says, I'm Lord of the Sabbath?

I'm the one who invented the Sabbath. I'm the one who fulfills the Sabbath. He's climbing to be  God. There was nothing they could do about that other than to say, we've got to do something  about that. What did they decide they were going to do?

They were furious at them. What did they decide they were going to have to do to them eventually? You know what they had to do? They had to haven't killed, but get this. That made him Lord of the Sabbath.

All they did was make him Lord of the Sabbath. Why? Because on the cross you see him  rising. Do you see him crying? Do you see him calling out?

Why is he so restless? Two verses. Isaiah 57-20. The wicked are like the tossing sea, which cannot rest, whose ways cast  up my or in mud. There is no peace for the wicked.

The wicked are like to see, which cannot rest,  and 2 Corinthians 5-21. On the cross God made him to be sin, who knew no sin,  that we might become the righteousness of God in him. What's going on with Jesus up there? Why is he doing all that? Why is he crying out?

Why is he writhing? He is experiencing. God is  making him experience because God is turning away from him. Infinite restlessness. There is no  rest for those who turn away from God.

He was experiencing it. Infinite restlessness. Cosmic  restlessness. Why? So that when he died, he was able to say what he did.

It is finished. What is finished? Everything necessary for salvation for the most exacting conscience,  for the most incredibly perfectionistic, eternal, inner murmur. Do you see that? In other words, Jesus Christ came to live a life you should have lived, perfectly, and  died that death you should have died, the penalty, perfectly, so that when God looks at you,  because you have received Christ as your Savior, and what does it mean to receive Christ as Savior?

What does it mean to be a Christian? It doesn't mean to say, I'm going to try to be like Jesus,  help me. To be a Christian is to say, I rest not on my works, but his. I rest on his finished work. Accept me because of not my record, his record.

Accept me not because of my work, because of his  works. And the minute you say that, God imputes your sin to him. That's what Second Corinthians 5,  21 means, and imputes his righteousness to you, which means that when God looks at you in Christ,  he says, it is good. And everything necessary that you've got to do is finished. And the only set of eyes in the world that you should have to prove yourself to has already said,  this is my beloved child in whom I'm well-pleased.

Remember, Jerry, it's a fire. Two guys. And so about the Sabbath, it's the only movie I know in the last 50 years about the  Sabbath that I know. And one guy can't stop working. He's a runner, he's a sprinter, and somebody  asks him, like they ask Rocky, why are you working so hard to go to the Olympics and win a medal?

And the answer is, I have 10 seconds, he's talking about the dash, you know, 9, 10 seconds the  dash. I have 10 seconds to justify my existence. I'm trying to prove myself. I'm trying to make sure  I know who I am, as Judith Schull of it says. That's the work under all the work.

And so he's driven,  but there's another guy who finds out that the gold medal, I mean, the medal race is going to be  held on a Sunday. And he's a Christian, and he's committed to the practice of Sabbath. But see,  the important thing, it's not a legalistic thing at all. He is so secure in who he is in Christ  that he is willing to say, I'm not going to run, even if it means costing a gold medal. The irony is, the first guy gets the gold medal, but it's not enough.

It's never enough, because  it's never, never enough, because the work underneath the work, the work that really makes you weary,  is never finished except in Jesus. In Jesus, God says, it is good. In Jesus, God looks at you and  says it is good. In Jesus, you hear it is finished. You get that, then you can move to the third point.

The third point is, if and only if you get the deep rest that Jesus Christ offers you, can you now  turn and ask the question, how do we do this? Now anything you try to do to practice Sabbath,  to take time off from work, to stay away from the, anything you do before you understand what I've  just gone through is never going to work. Focations don't deal with the deep thing, the deep rest,  the REM of the soul. But once you understand that, let me quickly at least make a list of a few things. What do we learn about how to do it?

How to actually practice Sabbath? And here are a few things,  and I got to be fast. Obviously, I can't go into too many details, but the last thing we see with  Jesus is, He heals a man on the Sabbath. Now, according to the Halak at the time, you could do  medical treatment if the man was dying. If the person was about to die, it was in dire situation.

But you ordinarily couldn't do medical treatment on it like this. You couldn't do this. So he broke the Sabbath, but notice he does not say, again, he does not say,  the reason I'm doing this is because the Sabbath is abrogated. We don't do Sabbath anymore. We don't need to practice the Sabbath.

That's not what he says. He talks as if the Sabbath is still there. He says, I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil? What he's saying is,  I'm doing what I should be doing on the Sabbath, which is restorative. I'm restoring the shriveled.

So here's what Jesus is telling us, unfortunately. We believe, most Christians believe that because  of Jesus coming, He fulfills the Sabbath in such a way that we do not have to go through all the  regulations of the Old Testament. We don't have to have 3,000 different things we can do and can't do. We can't walk this far. We can walk this far.

So we believe that, but that's a problem because Jesus  is saying the practice of Sabbath is still absolutely necessary. And because you don't have the rules,  you've got to have anything more danger as Christians who want to practice Sabbath because we don't  have the rules. There are certain disciplines I would suggest very, very strongly that you do. There's  three inner disciplines and several outer disciplines so that you can take what you have in Jesus  and practice Sabbath so that your relationship to work, and if you're in New York, it probably is  would not be any longer seriously out of whack. Interdisciplines.

First of all,  if you don't do these three inner disciplines, the outer ones won't work. Number one, interdiscipline. According to the Bible, Sabbath is an act of liberation. In Deuteronomy Chapter  15, God says, because I read it to you. In Deuteronomy Chapter 15, it says, remember that you were slaves  in Egypt and that I brought you out with a mighty hand.

Therefore, observe the Sabbath day. Isn't that interesting? While a God say, you were slaves, but you're free, therefore observe  the Sabbath day. And I'll tell you why because obviously, first of all, slaves didn't have a day off. If you don't rest, you're a slave.

Well, think about what this means. If you can't rest, if you can't... A lot of what I'm talking about here is not just work for income friends. A lot of you can't say no. A lot of you are incredibly over committed.

You're way too busy. You're always too busy. And if you are always too busy and you can't just say no to people and you can't set some time  aside, you're a slave. You're a slave. It's maybe self-imposed.

You're a slave to your own needs. You're a slave to your own insecurities. You're a slave to your own need of self-salvation. You're a slave to your family's hopes. You're a slave to your culture's expectations.

You're a slave to your company. But you're a slave. You have to say, inside your heart, deep into your  own soul, this is an act of liberation. My work does not define me. Christ defines me.

I am not defined by how many customers I get, how much money I make, how well I'm doing this. How expert I become. I am not. I'm taking time off today. I'm taking time off tonight.

I'm taking time off this week. I'm not going to think about it because I am not a slave. So it's an act of liberation, number one, number two. It's an act of trust. The Sabbath, our rest points to God's work and rest, which means you're not God.

He is. And one of the problems a lot of us have, and unless you tell yourself this is an interdiscipline,  you're not going to be able to take the time off you need to. You need to say it to yourself,  I am not the one who keeps the world running. I'm not the one who's bringing money to my family. I'm not the one who's meeting my needs.

I'm not the one. God is the one. I am not God. Sabbath is not only a discipline of liberation. It's a discipline of trust.

I'm not God. Better stop. I got to move on to the external disciplines, all right? There's five external disciplines. If you do the internal disciplines, and only if you do them,  you'll be able to relax at the external disciplines.

If you don't do the internal ones,  you're just going to spend the whole day somehow still weary when it's over. But here's the external disciplines. Number one, take more Sabbath time. Well, somebody says, how do you know how much to take? I'll get to that in a second, but probably more than you're taking, okay?

Take more Sabbath time. Number one, that's easy. Number two, balance your Sabbath time, which means do some  avocational, some contemplative, and some inactive stuff. Avocational means do some things that you  ordinarily don't do, okay? Fishing is an avocation if it's not how you make your living, right?

You know, a guy who makes his living fishing doesn't want to shouldn't fish on his day off, okay? But maybe you can. Avocation, and you need some of that, because in avocation,  you're enjoying God's finished work, his creation. Number two, contemplative. Judicial of it was absolutely right when she says, you're not doing the deep work of rest by  just doing leisure things.

You've got to tell yourself the story of who you are. The reason we  can't rest is we're not sure we're okay. She said that. And therefore, you've got to do worship  on your day off. In fact, this is not my day off.

Does everybody know that? This is a 16-hour day  for me. When I take my day off on Tuesday or Wednesday, what do I have to start with? I have to start  with worship. I've got to start with worship.

If I don't start with worship, I'm not really going  to be relaxed the rest of the time. I've got to tell myself who I am. I've got to tell myself  the story of who I am. Avocational, contemplative, and inactive. Now, what I mean by that is,  do you know in the Old Testament, not only people, but the land got a Sabbath year every so often,  did you know that?

And whenever the land got a Sabbath year, what do they do to it? Do they put  different grain in? No, they'll just let anything come up that would come up. And if you're not  rested, unless you have some unstructured time, some unplanned time, some time without family  gathering, sometimes without avocation, sometimes where you just can think about whatever thought comes,  feel whatever feeling comes. You've got to have some of that.

That's a biblical principle. So  balance your use of Sabbath time. So first, take more Sabbath times. Secondly, balance more  Sabbath time. Number three, be accountable for Sabbath time.

It is not possible in this world,  not to have seasons in which you tend to overwork. I don't know how you're going to be a doctor  ever unless you become a resident, which means you overwork for three years. I don't know how you  start a business without sometimes overworking at first, but you need to have accountability. You need to look at somebody in the eye and say, when the two years is up, when the one  year is up, when the three years is up, stop me because I do not want to spend the rest of my life  in under Sabbath mode. How many of you know the plates illustration?

You're kidding. When I came  here, I said to my wife and my children, I'm going to overwork for about three years because  we're going to start a church, but then it would be great. Three and a half years, four years,  no change in my schedule. One day, I was coming back into my apartment, and it was a warm day,  so the balcony was open, and there was my wife. She had plates, our wedding plates, plates  that were given to us when we first got married, and she was out there and she had a hammer.

And as I came in, I heard a smash, and then I looked out there, and there she was, and she put  another one down, and she took a hammer and she was smashing the plates. And I went up and I said,  what is going on? And she said, she says, you haven't heard me. You promised that you would  at a certain point power down. You're not taking enough time off.

You're not taking enough  Sabbath. You're not practicing Sabbath. And you're not hearing me. You're not hearing how incredibly  serious this is. You are not listening to me.

And I freaked out, and I was very upset, and I  you know, and I wept, and I can't believe you're this upset. And she said, I'm not that upset. And  she said, well, of course you must be that upset. And I was very upset. And it really sunk in,  and I really made a change.

But not long afterwards, I said to her, I said, you know, what do you mean you  weren't upset? She said, I really wasn't upset. I said, well, you must have been upset. She says, no. She says, you know, the plates that we've, you know, the saucers that I was breaking, they were all  saucers that we didn't have cups for anymore.

Be accountable. Number four,  inject Sabbath time into your work. Now, how does that? In other words, in the Old Testament,  there was a rule. There was a law called gleaning, and gleaning meant you could not  reap all the way out to the corners of your field.

It was a designed limit on productivity so you  wouldn't overwork. It will not be enough for you to work like a demon and then take time off. It means fewer goals. It means, at some point in your life, to really practice what this is saying,  to really get the right relationship to work. You probably are going to have to risk falling behind  in your career, or you will not be a disciple.

In other words, at some point you're going to say,  I'm going to do the things I need to do. Avocationally, contemplatively, I'm going to do my Sabbath. I'm going to do, I'm not going to let this work completely overwhelm me. And if you do this,  you're going to risk falling behind in your career. Maybe God will let you.

Maybe He won't. That's  up to Him. Either way, you'll be sane. And even if you fall behind the people who get ahead of you  because they're overworking won't be. So take more Sabbath time, balance your Sabbath time,  be accountable for Sabbath time, inject Sabbath time actually into your work and last of all  community.

Community. I've already hinted at this. The only way you're going to think these  things out is get some other people who are in the same job as you and brainstorm, how can we keep  ourselves from being overwhelmed by work? How can we put work in its place? How can you do  leisure?

How can you do rest? How can you do it? The only person whose eyes you should have to  prove yourself to looks at you now and says it is good. It is finished. Let that sink deeply  into your life.

It's going to change your attitude toward work. Let us pray. Thank you, Father,  for giving us what we need to know that we're able to have deep peace, deep poise. There's a calm in  our lives that can be here because we know that Jesus Christ has done everything necessary. He's finished  the work.

We pray therefore that we could take a look at all the other work that we do and never  get rid of our perfectionism, get rid of our overwork, get rid of our underwork because I know  Lord many of us underwork because we're afraid of failure, afraid of failure. Many people underwork  because they're afraid of failure. The gospel takes that out too because in Jesus Christ it is  finished. We thank you, Father, for this possibility, but we also know we don't realize that  by your Holy Spirit help us too. We ask in Jesus' name, amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

Today on the podcast, Tim Keller helps us  understand how the Gospel frees us to have hope and joy in our vocations. Now the scripture this morning is from Luke's Gospel chapter 6 verses 1 through 11. One Sabbath, Jesus was going through the grain fields and his disciples began to pick some heads  of grain, rub them in their hands and ate the kernels. Some of the Pharisees asked,  why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath? Jesus answered them,  have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?

He entered the house of God and taking the consecrated bread, he ate what is lawful only for  priests to eat, and he also gave some to his companions. Then Jesus said to them,  the son of man is Lord of the Sabbath. On another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching  and a man was there whose right hand was shriveled. The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were  looking for a reason to accuse Jesus so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath. But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled hand,  get up and stand in front of everyone.

So he got up and stood there. Then Jesus said to them,  I ask you which is lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil to save life or to destroy it. He looked around at them all and then said to the man, stretch out your hand. He did so and his  hand was completely restored, but they were furious and began to discuss with one another what they  might do to Jesus. This is God's word.

We're looking at the book of Luke and the life of Jesus  in the book of Luke. For a number of weeks we've been looking at Jesus' teaching about what it  means to follow him, what it means to be is disciple and of course Jesus is essentially taking  the gospel, who he is, what he did. And he's saying his disciples are people who apply the gospel  to absolutely every single area of life. And today we come to an area that is referred to. It's  covered in the fourth commandment of the Ten Commandments.

It's in Exodus 20. Six days you shall  labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord, your God. On it you  shall not do any work for on the seventh day the Lord rested. Sabbath rests. Now I know that  that we all have somewhat different relationships to work.

There are people here for example who are out of  work and would love to have more work. There are people here who in general have said to me that they  have a problem with work with discipline, but by and large in New York City, in the middle of New York  City, the biggest problem we have, one of the biggest problems we have is Sabbath rest, the discipline of  the getting of Sabbath rest. Why do we need it? Where do we get it? How do we do it?

Why do we need it? Where do we get it? How do we do it? It's all here. First of all, why do we need it?

Look at verse 1-2. Jesus and His disciples were going through a field on a Sabbath day,  and they picked some heads of grain, rubbed them in their hands to eat the kernels,  and they were condemned. They were accused of breaking the Sabbath by the Pharisees, and that's  because reaping grain was one of the 39 forms of work that was forbidden on the Sabbath day by the  halaka at the time, which is the religious regulations. As soon as you hear that, this was breaking  the Sabbath to just take the heads off of grain and rub them in your hands and get the kernels out  and eat them. Right away we say, oh, we say how legalistic, how moralistic, all those rules, how  awful.

We turn up our nose at it, but notice Jesus' response is not the Son of Man has come to do  away with the Sabbath, or to get us beyond all this. That's not what he says. He says the Son of  Man is Lord of the Sabbath, and we'll get to that in a second, but it means at least this, that I'm  all about the Sabbath. The Sabbath is what I'm all about, which means here's what we learn to start with. The most workaholic culture in the history of the world, it's us, dare not, turn up its nose at any  effort, even misguided efforts, to give to people one of the things most crucial to making life even  human, which is rest.

Judas Schulovitz, who is a writer for the New York Times magazine, probably in  New York Times book review, she wrote an article in New York Times magazine just this last month in  the first week of March called Bring Back the Sabbath, and she says this. First of all, she gives  a little bit of background on herself. She says she was raised probably in New York, I'm not sure,  but she was raised in a religious community at a synagogue, but like the average professional  secular New Yorker, she resisted and basically moved away from her religious upbringing, and then she  began to experience a phenomenon. Here's how she describes it. She says my mood would darken  every weekend.

Until by Saturday afternoon, I'd be unresponsive and morose. My normal routine, which  involved brunch with friends, made me feel impossibly restless. Then I began to do something that,  as a teenager, profoundly put off by her religious education, I could never have imagined ever  wanting to do. I began dropping in on a nearby synagogue. Finally, I developed a theory for my  condition.

If formerly people suffered from the Sabbath, which means all the regulations,  I now was suffering from the lack thereof. There is ample evidence that our relationship to work  is out of whack. Let me argue on behalf of an institution that has kept work of holism and  reasonable check for thousands of years. Most people mistakenly believe that all you have to do to  stop working is to not work. But the inventors of the Sabbath understood that it was a much more  complicated undertaking.

You cannot downshift casually and easily. This is why the Puritan and Jewish  Sabbaths were so exactly intentional. The rules did not exist to torture the faithful. Interrupting the ceaseless round of striving requires a surprisingly strenuous act of the will. One that has to be bolstered by habit, as well as by social sanction.

And what she's saying is  simply this. In spite of the fact she knows about, she recognizes the potential for abuse. Our relationship to work as a society is so seriously out of whack. That anyone who thinks that you're going to be able to get rested by simply knocking off  whenever you feel tired is hopelessly naive. The ability to rest, deeply rest, is a life or death  thing.

No one can do without it. But it is not natural. It is not simple. It is absolutely  difficult. And it takes an enormous amount of discipline and practice.

That's what she's saying. Now why would that be? Why would it be so hard? Well, first of all, we have to look at our modern  situation. I'll do that briefly.

The modern situation means that the eternal human need for rest  is enormously aggravated. Let me give you four trends. A, B, C, D, trends. Trend 1, A, excuse me,  an A trend, is the fact that more and more, at least in Western culture, jobs are insecure. The idea of jobs, hold departments.

If they don't perform, if they don't turn profit, they're  eliminated. Job security has never been a culture. Never been a place where job security was so bad. I don't think. Number two, these are the same big things and kind of in nut shells here.

There's been a lot of research done on the fact that where it used to be, the people making  the money at the top of a company, you used to make maybe 10 or 20 times with people at the  bottom of the company made. Now it's more like 100 to 200 times. And partly as a result of this,  to some degree, increasingly, people who make large amounts of money are expected  to put in enormous numbers of hours. It's just expected. And if you don't want to do it,  there's a line behind you.

Whereas people on the bottom are having to take multiple jobs. So  everybody's overworked as a matter where you are on the scale. In order to make ends meet,  they have to take multiple jobs. That's B, C, technology, A technology. You can work anywhere.

Which means, now, we work everywhere. It means that you can't stop work from spilling out  into every nook and crane of your life. And that's C and D. The fourth trend, and this is a little  more complex. Cultural analysts have said, and there's pretty much universal agreement on this,  that whereas traditional societies said, you got your meaning in life through your family.

You got your meaning in life through family. And through basically fulfilling a fairly prescribed  social role, either as a mother or father or brother or sister, husband or wife or son or daughter. And work wasn't as important in a situation like that. You just need to find a way to make a living  because family was what everything was about. But we are the first culture in history that says,  you define yourself by deciding what you want to be and attaining it.

And then you have significance,  which means that work, there's never been more psychological and social and emotional  pressure on work to be either fulfilling or at least lucrative. There's never been a culture  like that, which means A, B, C, D, A, B and C, you know, mean that we are more desperately in  need of rest than we ever have less time for rest than ever. And D means we emotionally on the  inside have less ability to rest and relax than we anyone ever has had, any cultures ever had. But as bad as that is, as aggravating as the modern situation is, the Sabbath is an ancient practice  because there is an abiding human problem that has always been there. The Sabbath is obviously not  a response to modern hecticness.

There's something that's already been there and what is that  thing that's already been down there? There's something else that needs to be addressed by Sabbath. And Judith Schulovitz, and this is just a terrific article. She understands what that deeper thing is  when she says, quote, when the Sabbath was still sacred, not only did drudgery give way to festivity  and family gatherings and occasional worship, but the machinery of self-censorship shut down too,  stilling the eternal inner murmur of self-reproach. The eternal inner murmur of self-reproach.

The inner machinery, now what is she talking about there? Sleep experts know that in order to be restored,  you don't just need amount of sleep, but depth of sleep, what they call  REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. And of course, they say, I think that only happens after certain  period of time. In other words, if you would take eight, one hour naps or something like that,  and you say, I slept for eight hours, the next day, you would be absolutely just fatigued  because you have to, I think sleep a certain period of time before, you go into deep sleep,  rapid eye movement sleep. And so it's not just so much amount of sleep, it's the depth of sleep  that you need, and hear what she's saying, and what I'm saying is, there is, on the one hand,  your external work, and you do need rest from physical exertion, but there is a deeper problem.

There is a work underneath the work. There is an eternal inner murmur. There is an inner machinery of self-censorship. What does she mean by that? It's not guilt.

It's the need to prove yourself to yourself, to others, and that work  makes the other kinds of work incredibly weary. That's what brings the wearyness. And that work, which is very, very difficult, you're always trying to prove yourself, you're trying  to make sure that you, you know, that work, it's never enough. You're never, it's never enough. And because of that, you see, that's rapid eye movement, deep rest of the soul  that you've got to have, or else all the vacations, number one, help.

If you take your vacations, you knock off, but you're not able to deal with that,  you're not able to get that deeper rest, able to get that spiritual rest,  you're going to be in fatigue all the time. So under the big rest, under the physical rest,  as a need for deep spiritual rest. For example, you know, the only good rocky movie, the first one,  the question comes to rocky, you know, why are you driven? Why are you doing all this performance? You know, why are you, you know, why are those trumpets blazing as you run through the streets  of Little Italy and Philadelphia and go up the art museum steps?

Why are you working so hard? And his answer was, I want to go the distance, then I'll know I'm not a bum. So our hero is being driven by the eternal inner murmur of self-reproach. The inner machinery. That's why he's working so hard.

That's why he makes it to the top, et cetera. That's why he's going to burn out. That's why the other movies are going to be terrible. There is a deep need for a deep soul rest, without which physical rest is not going to help you. So we need Sabbath rest.

We've never needed it more than we do now, but we need it. So that's why  we need it. Number one, number two, where do we get it? Now let's look at what Jesus says. They say he's violating the Sabbath and how does he respond?

Well, he says,  have you ever read that what David did when he and his companions were hungry? He entered the house of God and taken the consecrated bread. He ate what is lawful for only  priest to eat, and then he gave some to his companions. Now what's interesting here is Jesus takes  an incident from 1 Samuel 21, where we're told that David, when he was on run for his life, he was  running for his life. He went through the tabernacle, and in the tabernacle, there is the place where  the show bread, which was the bread of the presence.

It was in the holy place. In the tabernacle was  part of the Sabbath worship, and you are not allowed to eat it. It was part of the worship,  and David ate it. Of course, as Jesus implies, he was never condemned for it. God never said  it was anything wrong with what he did.

He was never condemned for it at all. Now Jesus is inviting  us to think out the implications of that. If the Sabbath and worship regulations can be set aside  in a pinch, but on the other hand, if there's absolutely no place anywhere in the Bible, where the  moral law can be set aside in a pinch. There's no place where God says, well, you were in a hurry,  so committing adultery is all right, worshiping an idol is all right, stealing, robbing, armed  robbery. That was all right.

You know you were in trouble. You were in, no, if there's no place  ever where the moral law is set aside in a pinch, but the Sabbath and the ceremonial and the  worship regulations are set aside in a pinch. What does this mean? Think of the reasoning. It means that they are provisional, meaning that means they are temporary,  meaning that they will end when something comes along that makes them obsolete to which they point.

And what would that be? He says, it's very, very next verse. Then Jesus says to them, assuming that  they are thinking along these lines, I am Lord of the Sabbath, which is astounding. Let's think  about what he's saying. He's saying actually, more things than I'm going to be able to open up  in this sermon, but he's saying this.

I am the one that the Sabbath regulations all pointed to. I can give you the deep rest of the soul that you most need. I am the Lord of rest. Jesus, I am  the Lord of rest. And you know what this means, two ways.

If you want rest, you have to go to him. And if you think you've gone to him, but you don't have any rest, you still don't know what you have. You still haven't taken hold of what you have. You still haven't understood what you have. Now, how and why?

How is he the Lord of rest and why? All right. Let me take you to three  couple passages, a couple of other verses that are important. What does this mean that he's Lord  of rest? What does it mean to give you rest?

First of all, let's go to the original verse in the  Bible about this. You go all the way back to Genesis 1, the end of Genesis 1, the beginning of Genesis 2,  and God has just finished creating the world. And this is what we read. And God saw that all he had  created, pardon me, and God saw that all he had made, it was good. And God finished the work he had  been doing so that on the seventh day, he rested from his work.

God rested seventh day, right? But what do you mean God rested? Was he tired? God can't be tired. And if God can't be tired,  what in the world does it mean he's rested?

You and I can define rest as getting over being tired. What does it mean that God rested if he wasn't tired? And here's the answer. One of the things that's so neat about the creation account is every time God makes something  before he moves on to something else, he says something over and over and over again. You know what  it is?

He makes something and he looks at it and he says, that's good. That was good. Then he  makes something else and he says, that's good. And then when he gets to the very end, it's the  which I just read. He looks at all of it and he says, very good.

And that's what it means to rest. To be utterly satisfied with what's been done. To be utterly satisfied. That's the only way you can  walk away. It's the only way you can stop.

The only way you can put your doing down is if you're  absolutely satisfied with the doing. That's good. That is good. Now you can rest. Now you can relax.

So you see, the definition of resting is to be utterly satisfied with what was done. Secondly,  second verse. Scroll forward, Hebrews chapter 4 is talking about the gospel. The Hebrews writer  is talking to Christians about what it means to believe in Jesus. And as he's talking about the  gospel and believing in Jesus, suddenly he says this, there remains then a rest for the people of  God.

For anyone who through the gospel enters God's rest, rest from his own work just as God  rested from his. Now this is an amazing statement. What does it mean to become a Christian? I mean,  there's a whole lot of ways of putting it. And the reason you need every different way is because  you need them all to understand the richness of it.

To become a Christian is someone who's  able to look at your work the way God looked at his, able to look at your life the way God looked  at his. You're being told here that through Jesus Christ, you can look at your life. You can  look at yourself and say, it's absolutely satisfying. It's absolutely good. There's nothing else  that needs to be done.

It is good. All the work that I need to do is finished. It's estimated that most of us spend half of our waking hours at work. How does the wisdom of the  Bible apply to our careers? In other words, how can our work connect with God's work and how can  our vocations be more emotional?

In his book, Every Good and Devere, Tim Keller draws from decades of  teaching on vocation and calling to show you how to find true joy in your work as you serve God and  others. The book offers surprising insights into how a Christian perspective on work can serve as  the foundation for a thriving career and a balanced personal life. Every good endeavor is our thank you  for your gift to help gospel and life share Christ's love with more people around the world. Just visit  gospelandlife.com slash give. That's gospelandlife.com slash give.

How could that be? How is that possible? But you see, look,  Judas Schulovitz, one more time. I'm going to go back to her one more time because it's such a great  article. She gives us insight and she puts it like this.

And this is great. She says, not even our  most pardon me, not even our group leisure activities can do for us what the Sabbath rituals could  once be counted on to do. Hear that? She says, not enough for you to just knock off and go on out  there and do all your leisure activity. That's not going to give you the rest from the eternal inner  murmur and inner machinery.

Oh no. She says, she says, not even our group, group leisure activities  can do for us what Sabbath rituals could once be counted to do because religious rituals do not  exist simply to promote togetherness. They are designed to convey to us a story about who  we are. The story told by the Sabbath is of creation. God rested and we rest in order to  honor the image of the divine in us to remind us that there's more to us than our work.

Now she  to a great degree has discerned exactly what the Hebrews writers trying to say. Remember we said there's a work underneath as well as the work up here. There's a physical work  but the thing that makes things really worry, really weary is not the physical work because  listen, you go back into the book of Genesis, you go back to Paradise, go to the Garden of Eden and  there was work there. In other words, what really is there are problems is not the presence of work,  it's the absence of deep rest. So there's the external work but then there's the work down here.

What is that? And she knows what it is. She already talked about it. She called the eternal  inner murmur a self approach but here's what it is. It's trying to know who you are.

It's trying to show to other people and to yourself, I know I'm somebody important or something  to me, something important. And you do it through the doing. Every human being does it. Religious  people say if I'm really good and if I do many, many good works, God will bless me. Secular people though, their hearts operate on the very same basis, the very same basis.

They don't believe in God or believe in law or the Bible or anything but they have set their  standards and their entire self-image rests on meeting those standards and living up to those goals. That's the work, under the work. Always having to prove yourself, always having to assure  yourself that you're somebody important. But that work is never finished. Never finished.

It's never over. It's never enough. You never can look under those circumstances that you're doing  and say, it's good. Maybe one day occasionally, but what about tomorrow? There's always tomorrow.

You can never say what God said and see what is rest. To be able to look and say, I am satisfied. It is good. It is finished. But the Hebrews writer says,  through Jesus and only through Jesus, can you get this rest.

Jesus is the one who said,  come unto me, O ye who labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon me for I am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls. From my burden is easy. My yoke is easy and my burden is light. What he's saying is,  everybody's serving something.

Everybody's trying to get an identity out of something. But only if you make me the meaning of your life will you get absolute rest. Only through me will  you be able to look at yourself, look at your work, look at everything and say it's finished. Everything is necessary that to be done has been done. It is good.

How is that possible? Here's how it's possible. How's that possible through Jesus? Here's how it's possible. Look at  the last verse.

There's a great irony in this verse. You have to put verse 11 together with verse 5. When they were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus. Now why were they so furious? Do you know what it means when he says, I'm Lord of the Sabbath?

I'm the one who invented the Sabbath. I'm the one who fulfills the Sabbath. He's climbing to be  God. There was nothing they could do about that other than to say, we've got to do something  about that. What did they decide they were going to do?

They were furious at them. What did they decide they were going to have to do to them eventually? You know what they had to do? They had to haven't killed, but get this. That made him Lord of the Sabbath.

All they did was make him Lord of the Sabbath. Why? Because on the cross you see him  rising. Do you see him crying? Do you see him calling out?

Why is he so restless? Two verses. Isaiah 57-20. The wicked are like the tossing sea, which cannot rest, whose ways cast  up my or in mud. There is no peace for the wicked.

The wicked are like to see, which cannot rest,  and 2 Corinthians 5-21. On the cross God made him to be sin, who knew no sin,  that we might become the righteousness of God in him. What's going on with Jesus up there? Why is he doing all that? Why is he crying out?

Why is he writhing? He is experiencing. God is  making him experience because God is turning away from him. Infinite restlessness. There is no  rest for those who turn away from God.

He was experiencing it. Infinite restlessness. Cosmic  restlessness. Why? So that when he died, he was able to say what he did.

It is finished. What is finished? Everything necessary for salvation for the most exacting conscience,  for the most incredibly perfectionistic, eternal, inner murmur. Do you see that? In other words, Jesus Christ came to live a life you should have lived, perfectly, and  died that death you should have died, the penalty, perfectly, so that when God looks at you,  because you have received Christ as your Savior, and what does it mean to receive Christ as Savior?

What does it mean to be a Christian? It doesn't mean to say, I'm going to try to be like Jesus,  help me. To be a Christian is to say, I rest not on my works, but his. I rest on his finished work. Accept me because of not my record, his record.

Accept me not because of my work, because of his  works. And the minute you say that, God imputes your sin to him. That's what Second Corinthians 5,  21 means, and imputes his righteousness to you, which means that when God looks at you in Christ,  he says, it is good. And everything necessary that you've got to do is finished. And the only set of eyes in the world that you should have to prove yourself to has already said,  this is my beloved child in whom I'm well-pleased.

Remember, Jerry, it's a fire. Two guys. And so about the Sabbath, it's the only movie I know in the last 50 years about the  Sabbath that I know. And one guy can't stop working. He's a runner, he's a sprinter, and somebody  asks him, like they ask Rocky, why are you working so hard to go to the Olympics and win a medal?

And the answer is, I have 10 seconds, he's talking about the dash, you know, 9, 10 seconds the  dash. I have 10 seconds to justify my existence. I'm trying to prove myself. I'm trying to make sure  I know who I am, as Judith Schull of it says. That's the work under all the work.

And so he's driven,  but there's another guy who finds out that the gold medal, I mean, the medal race is going to be  held on a Sunday. And he's a Christian, and he's committed to the practice of Sabbath. But see,  the important thing, it's not a legalistic thing at all. He is so secure in who he is in Christ  that he is willing to say, I'm not going to run, even if it means costing a gold medal. The irony is, the first guy gets the gold medal, but it's not enough.

It's never enough, because  it's never, never enough, because the work underneath the work, the work that really makes you weary,  is never finished except in Jesus. In Jesus, God says, it is good. In Jesus, God looks at you and  says it is good. In Jesus, you hear it is finished. You get that, then you can move to the third point.

The third point is, if and only if you get the deep rest that Jesus Christ offers you, can you now  turn and ask the question, how do we do this? Now anything you try to do to practice Sabbath,  to take time off from work, to stay away from the, anything you do before you understand what I've  just gone through is never going to work. Focations don't deal with the deep thing, the deep rest,  the REM of the soul. But once you understand that, let me quickly at least make a list of a few things. What do we learn about how to do it?

How to actually practice Sabbath? And here are a few things,  and I got to be fast. Obviously, I can't go into too many details, but the last thing we see with  Jesus is, He heals a man on the Sabbath. Now, according to the Halak at the time, you could do  medical treatment if the man was dying. If the person was about to die, it was in dire situation.

But you ordinarily couldn't do medical treatment on it like this. You couldn't do this. So he broke the Sabbath, but notice he does not say, again, he does not say,  the reason I'm doing this is because the Sabbath is abrogated. We don't do Sabbath anymore. We don't need to practice the Sabbath.

That's not what he says. He talks as if the Sabbath is still there. He says, I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil? What he's saying is,  I'm doing what I should be doing on the Sabbath, which is restorative. I'm restoring the shriveled.

So here's what Jesus is telling us, unfortunately. We believe, most Christians believe that because  of Jesus coming, He fulfills the Sabbath in such a way that we do not have to go through all the  regulations of the Old Testament. We don't have to have 3,000 different things we can do and can't do. We can't walk this far. We can walk this far.

So we believe that, but that's a problem because Jesus  is saying the practice of Sabbath is still absolutely necessary. And because you don't have the rules,  you've got to have anything more danger as Christians who want to practice Sabbath because we don't  have the rules. There are certain disciplines I would suggest very, very strongly that you do. There's  three inner disciplines and several outer disciplines so that you can take what you have in Jesus  and practice Sabbath so that your relationship to work, and if you're in New York, it probably is  would not be any longer seriously out of whack. Interdisciplines.

First of all,  if you don't do these three inner disciplines, the outer ones won't work. Number one, interdiscipline. According to the Bible, Sabbath is an act of liberation. In Deuteronomy Chapter  15, God says, because I read it to you. In Deuteronomy Chapter 15, it says, remember that you were slaves  in Egypt and that I brought you out with a mighty hand.

Therefore, observe the Sabbath day. Isn't that interesting? While a God say, you were slaves, but you're free, therefore observe  the Sabbath day. And I'll tell you why because obviously, first of all, slaves didn't have a day off. If you don't rest, you're a slave.

Well, think about what this means. If you can't rest, if you can't... A lot of what I'm talking about here is not just work for income friends. A lot of you can't say no. A lot of you are incredibly over committed.

You're way too busy. You're always too busy. And if you are always too busy and you can't just say no to people and you can't set some time  aside, you're a slave. You're a slave. It's maybe self-imposed.

You're a slave to your own needs. You're a slave to your own insecurities. You're a slave to your own need of self-salvation. You're a slave to your family's hopes. You're a slave to your culture's expectations.

You're a slave to your company. But you're a slave. You have to say, inside your heart, deep into your  own soul, this is an act of liberation. My work does not define me. Christ defines me.

I am not defined by how many customers I get, how much money I make, how well I'm doing this. How expert I become. I am not. I'm taking time off today. I'm taking time off tonight.

I'm taking time off this week. I'm not going to think about it because I am not a slave. So it's an act of liberation, number one, number two. It's an act of trust. The Sabbath, our rest points to God's work and rest, which means you're not God.

He is. And one of the problems a lot of us have, and unless you tell yourself this is an interdiscipline,  you're not going to be able to take the time off you need to. You need to say it to yourself,  I am not the one who keeps the world running. I'm not the one who's bringing money to my family. I'm not the one who's meeting my needs.

I'm not the one. God is the one. I am not God. Sabbath is not only a discipline of liberation. It's a discipline of trust.

I'm not God. Better stop. I got to move on to the external disciplines, all right? There's five external disciplines. If you do the internal disciplines, and only if you do them,  you'll be able to relax at the external disciplines.

If you don't do the internal ones,  you're just going to spend the whole day somehow still weary when it's over. But here's the external disciplines. Number one, take more Sabbath time. Well, somebody says, how do you know how much to take? I'll get to that in a second, but probably more than you're taking, okay?

Take more Sabbath time. Number one, that's easy. Number two, balance your Sabbath time, which means do some  avocational, some contemplative, and some inactive stuff. Avocational means do some things that you  ordinarily don't do, okay? Fishing is an avocation if it's not how you make your living, right?

You know, a guy who makes his living fishing doesn't want to shouldn't fish on his day off, okay? But maybe you can. Avocation, and you need some of that, because in avocation,  you're enjoying God's finished work, his creation. Number two, contemplative. Judicial of it was absolutely right when she says, you're not doing the deep work of rest by  just doing leisure things.

You've got to tell yourself the story of who you are. The reason we  can't rest is we're not sure we're okay. She said that. And therefore, you've got to do worship  on your day off. In fact, this is not my day off.

Does everybody know that? This is a 16-hour day  for me. When I take my day off on Tuesday or Wednesday, what do I have to start with? I have to start  with worship. I've got to start with worship.

If I don't start with worship, I'm not really going  to be relaxed the rest of the time. I've got to tell myself who I am. I've got to tell myself  the story of who I am. Avocational, contemplative, and inactive. Now, what I mean by that is,  do you know in the Old Testament, not only people, but the land got a Sabbath year every so often,  did you know that?

And whenever the land got a Sabbath year, what do they do to it? Do they put  different grain in? No, they'll just let anything come up that would come up. And if you're not  rested, unless you have some unstructured time, some unplanned time, some time without family  gathering, sometimes without avocation, sometimes where you just can think about whatever thought comes,  feel whatever feeling comes. You've got to have some of that.

That's a biblical principle. So  balance your use of Sabbath time. So first, take more Sabbath times. Secondly, balance more  Sabbath time. Number three, be accountable for Sabbath time.

It is not possible in this world,  not to have seasons in which you tend to overwork. I don't know how you're going to be a doctor  ever unless you become a resident, which means you overwork for three years. I don't know how you  start a business without sometimes overworking at first, but you need to have accountability. You need to look at somebody in the eye and say, when the two years is up, when the one  year is up, when the three years is up, stop me because I do not want to spend the rest of my life  in under Sabbath mode. How many of you know the plates illustration?

You're kidding. When I came  here, I said to my wife and my children, I'm going to overwork for about three years because  we're going to start a church, but then it would be great. Three and a half years, four years,  no change in my schedule. One day, I was coming back into my apartment, and it was a warm day,  so the balcony was open, and there was my wife. She had plates, our wedding plates, plates  that were given to us when we first got married, and she was out there and she had a hammer.

And as I came in, I heard a smash, and then I looked out there, and there she was, and she put  another one down, and she took a hammer and she was smashing the plates. And I went up and I said,  what is going on? And she said, she says, you haven't heard me. You promised that you would  at a certain point power down. You're not taking enough time off.

You're not taking enough  Sabbath. You're not practicing Sabbath. And you're not hearing me. You're not hearing how incredibly  serious this is. You are not listening to me.

And I freaked out, and I was very upset, and I  you know, and I wept, and I can't believe you're this upset. And she said, I'm not that upset. And  she said, well, of course you must be that upset. And I was very upset. And it really sunk in,  and I really made a change.

But not long afterwards, I said to her, I said, you know, what do you mean you  weren't upset? She said, I really wasn't upset. I said, well, you must have been upset. She says, no. She says, you know, the plates that we've, you know, the saucers that I was breaking, they were all  saucers that we didn't have cups for anymore.

Be accountable. Number four,  inject Sabbath time into your work. Now, how does that? In other words, in the Old Testament,  there was a rule. There was a law called gleaning, and gleaning meant you could not  reap all the way out to the corners of your field.

It was a designed limit on productivity so you  wouldn't overwork. It will not be enough for you to work like a demon and then take time off. It means fewer goals. It means, at some point in your life, to really practice what this is saying,  to really get the right relationship to work. You probably are going to have to risk falling behind  in your career, or you will not be a disciple.

In other words, at some point you're going to say,  I'm going to do the things I need to do. Avocationally, contemplatively, I'm going to do my Sabbath. I'm going to do, I'm not going to let this work completely overwhelm me. And if you do this,  you're going to risk falling behind in your career. Maybe God will let you.

Maybe He won't. That's  up to Him. Either way, you'll be sane. And even if you fall behind the people who get ahead of you  because they're overworking won't be. So take more Sabbath time, balance your Sabbath time,  be accountable for Sabbath time, inject Sabbath time actually into your work and last of all  community.

Community. I've already hinted at this. The only way you're going to think these  things out is get some other people who are in the same job as you and brainstorm, how can we keep  ourselves from being overwhelmed by work? How can we put work in its place? How can you do  leisure?

How can you do rest? How can you do it? The only person whose eyes you should have to  prove yourself to looks at you now and says it is good. It is finished. Let that sink deeply  into your life.

It's going to change your attitude toward work. Let us pray. Thank you, Father,  for giving us what we need to know that we're able to have deep peace, deep poise. There's a calm in  our lives that can be here because we know that Jesus Christ has done everything necessary. He's finished  the work.

We pray therefore that we could take a look at all the other work that we do and never  get rid of our perfectionism, get rid of our overwork, get rid of our underwork because I know  Lord many of us underwork because we're afraid of failure, afraid of failure. Many people underwork  because they're afraid of failure. The gospel takes that out too because in Jesus Christ it is  finished. We thank you, Father, for this possibility, but we also know we don't realize that  by your Holy Spirit help us too. We ask in Jesus' name, amen.

### 引言：工作的挣扎

你是否在努力寻找工作中的意义和目标？我们大部分的生活都在工作中度过，但工作往往是我们感到最沮丧和徒劳的领域。今天在播客中，Tim Keller 帮助我们理解福音如何使我们在职业中获得希望和喜悦。

今天早上的经文来自路加福音第六章第一至十一节。

> 安息日，耶稣经过麦田，门徒掐了些麦穗，用手搓着吃了。有些法利赛人问，为什么你们在安息日做不合法的事？耶稣回答他们，难道你们没有读过大卫和跟随他的人饥饿时所做的事吗？他进了神的殿，拿了陈设饼吃了，这饼只有祭司才可以吃，他也给了跟随他的人。于是耶稣对他们说，人子是安息日的主。

**在另一个安息日，他进了会堂教导，有一个右手枯干的人在那里。法利赛人和律法教师寻找控告耶稣的理由，所以他们密切观察他是否会在安息日治病。但耶稣知道他们的心思，对那枯干手的人说，起来，站在众人面前。他就起来站着。耶稣对他们说，我问你们，在安息日行善还是作恶，救命还是害命，哪样是合法的？他环顾四周，对那人说，伸出你的手。他照做了，手就完全复原了，但他们非常愤怒，开始彼此商议如何对付耶稣。**

这是上帝的话。

### 安息日休息的必要性

我们正在看路加福音和耶稣在路加福音中的生活。几周以来，我们一直在研究耶稣关于跟随他的教导，成为他的门徒意味着什么，当然，耶稣本质上是在传递福音，他是谁，他做了什么。他说他的门徒是那些将福音应用于生活每个领域的人。

今天我们来到一个被提到的领域。它在十诫的第四条诫命中被涵盖。它在出埃及记二十章。

> 六日要劳碌做你一切的工，但第七日是向耶和华你神当守的安息日。这一天你不可做任何工，因为在第七日耶和华休息了。

安息日的休息。现在我知道我们每个人对工作的关系都有些不同。这里有些人失业，渴望有更多的工作。这里有些人一般对我说他们在工作纪律上有问题，但大体上在纽约市，在纽约市的中心，我们最大的问题之一是安息日的休息，获取安息日休息的纪律。

**为什么我们需要它？我们从哪里得到它？我们怎么做？为什么我们需要它？我们从哪里得到它？我们怎么做？这一切都在这里。**

### 在哪里找到真正的安息

首先，为什么我们需要它？看看第一到第二节。耶稣和他的门徒在安息日经过一块田地，他们掐了些麦穗，用手搓着吃了麦粒，他们被指责。法利赛人指责他们违反了安息日，因为在当时的哈拉卡中，收割麦穗是安息日禁止的三十九种工作之一，这是宗教法规。

一听到这个，我们就会说，哦，我们说多么律法主义，多么道德主义，所有这些规则，多么可怕。我们对此嗤之以鼻，但注意耶稣的回应不是人子来是要废掉安息日，或超越这一切。他没有这么说。他说人子是安息日的主，我们稍后会谈到这点，但至少意味着我是关于安息日的。安息日是我的全部，这意味着我们从一开始就学到的。

**历史上最工作狂的文化，就是我们，不敢对任何努力，即使是误导的努力，嗤之以鼻，因为这些努力是为了给人们提供使生活甚至是人性化的最关键的东西，即休息。**

### 如何实践安息日休息

Judith Schulovitz 是《纽约时报》杂志的作家，可能在《纽约时报》书评中，她在三月的第一个星期在《纽约时报》杂志上写了一篇文章，题为《带回安息日》，她这样说。

首先，她给出了一些关于她自己的背景。她说她可能是在纽约长大的，我不确定，但她是在一个宗教社区的犹太教堂长大的，但像大多数专业的世俗纽约人一样，她抵制并基本上远离了她的宗教背景，然后她开始经历一种现象。她这样描述它。

> 我的情绪每个周末都会变得阴郁。直到周六下午，我会变得无反应和忧郁。我的正常日常活动，包括与朋友共进早午餐，使我感到无法安宁。然后我开始做一些作为青少年时被宗教教育深深打击的事情，我从未想过会想做。我开始偶尔去附近的犹太教堂。最后，我为我的状况发展出一个理论。如果以前的人因安息日而受苦，这意味着所有的规定，我现在因缺乏而受苦。

有充分的证据表明我们与工作的关系失衡。让我为一个已经保持工作狂合理检查数千年的机构辩护。大多数人错误地认为停止工作只需不工作即可。但安息日的发明者明白这是一项更复杂的任务。你不能随意轻松地减速。这就是为什么清教徒和犹太人的安息日如此精确的原因。规则不是为了折磨信徒。中断无休止的努力循环需要一种出乎意料的意志力。这需要习惯和社会制裁的支持。

她所说的很简单。尽管她知道并承认潜在的滥用。我们作为一个社会与工作的关系严重失衡。任何认为你可以通过简单地在感到疲倦时停止工作来获得休息的人都是无可救药的天真。

**深度休息的能力是生死攸关的事情。没有人能没有它。但这不是自然的。这不是简单的。这是绝对困难的。它需要大量的纪律和实践。**

## Chinese Transcript / 中文

今天的播客里，提姆·凯勒要帮助我们明白，福音如何使我们在自己的职业中，仍然能有盼望和喜乐。

今天读的经文来自路加福音第 6 章 1–11 节：

一个安息日，耶稣从麦地经过；他的门徒掐了麦穗，用手搓着吃。有几个法利赛人说：“你们做什么，是在安息日不可做的呢？”耶稣对他们说：“经上记着大卫和跟随他的人饥饿之时所做的，你们没有念过吗？

他怎么进了　神的殿，拿陈设饼吃，又给跟随他的人吃；这饼除了祭司以外，别人都不可吃。”又对他们说：“人子是安息日的主。”

又有一个安息日，耶稣进了会堂教训人。在那里有一个人右手枯干了。文士和法利赛人窥探耶稣，在安息日医病不医，好得把柄去控告他。耶稣却知道他们的意念，就对那枯干一只手的人说：“起来，站在当中！”那人就起来站着。

耶稣对他们说：“我问你们：在安息日行善行恶、救命害命，哪样是可以的呢？”他就周围看着他们众人，对那人说：“伸出手来！”他把手一伸，手就复了原。他们就满心大怒，彼此商议怎样处治耶稣。

这是上帝的话。


我们一直在查考路加福音，看耶稣的一生。好几个星期以来，我们都在看耶稣关于“跟随他”意味着什么、做门徒意味着什么的教导。其实，耶稣在做的一件事情，就是把福音——他是谁，他成就了什么——应用到人生每一个层面上。耶稣在说，门徒就是那些把福音应用到生命中每一个领域的人。

今天我们来到的是一个在十诫中被提到的领域——第四诫：出埃及记 20 章说：“六日要劳碌做你一切的工，但第七日是向耶和华你上帝当守的安息日；这一天，你和你的儿女、仆婢、牲畜，并你城里寄居的客旅，无论何工都不可做。因为六日之内，耶和华造天、地、海和其中的万物，第七日便安息。”这就是安息日的安息。


我知道，我们每个人和“工作”的关系都不太一样。

有些人现在失业，巴不得有更多的工作；也有人会对我说，他们的问题是缺乏工作上的自律。但总的来说，在纽约这样的城市中心，我们面临的最大问题之一，其实是“安息日的安息”——操练安息日、得着安息日安息的这个操练。

为什么我们需要它？我们从哪里得着它？我们要怎样实际去做？

为什么需要？从哪里得？要怎么做？这些问题，这段经文里都有答案。

首先，为什么我们需要安息？


看第 1–2 节：在一个安息日，耶稣和他的门徒从麦地经过，掐了麦穗，用手搓着吃，就被指控违背安息日。为什么呢？因为在当时的“哈拉卡”（宗教规条）里，收割谷物是安息日被禁止的三十九种劳作之一。

一听到这里，我们马上会说：太律法主义、太道德主义了，规条这么多，真可怕。我们会嗤之以鼻。但是注意耶稣的回应：

他不是说：“人子来是要废掉安息日，或者带你们超越这一切。”

他反而说：“人子是安息日的主。”

这句话，等一下我们会展开，但至少说明了一件事：耶稣在说，“我整个人，就是围绕安息日的。我来，就是要成就安息。”

这让我们一开始就学到一点：在整个人类历史上也许最“工作狂”的文化里，就是我们这个文化，绝对没有资格对那些想要给人真正安息的努力——即便有些方式很偏差、充满误用——嗤之以鼻。因为“安息”是让人活得像“人”的最关键要素之一。

朱迪思·舒洛维茨（Judith Shulevitz）是《纽约时报杂志》和书评版的作者。就在上个月三月的第一周，她在《纽约时报杂志》写了一篇文章，标题叫《把安息日带回来》（Bring Back the Sabbath）。

她先简短地交代了自己的背景：她在一个宗教社区里长大，常去会堂礼拜——大概也是在纽约，我不太确定。但像很多受过高等教育的世俗纽约职业人士一样，她后来基本上离开了自己宗教的成长背景。接着，她开始经历一个现象。她这样描述：

“每到周末，我的心情就会变得低落，到了周六下午，我几乎变得毫无反应、闷闷不乐。原本习惯和朋友一起吃早午餐，这些事突然都让我感到格外坐立难安。后来，我开始做一件 teenage 时代的我、那个被宗教教育深深劝退的我，从来想象不到会去做的事——我开始时不时走进附近的一间犹太会堂。”

“最终，我为自己的状况发展出了一个理论：如果说从前的人是被安息日折磨的（指各种规条），那现在的我，是被‘没有安息日’这件事折磨。”

“我们和工作的关系已经严重失衡，这一点证据太多了。请允许我为一个制度辩护——数千年来，这个制度帮助人类把工作狂的倾向限制在一个较为合理的范围之内。大多数人以为，停止工作只要‘不再工作’就好了。但发明安息日的那些人，比我们了解得多得多：他们看得清楚，这其实是一件复杂得多的事情。”

“你不可能随随便便就把自己降档慢下来。这就是为什么清教徒和犹太人的安息日传统如此强调‘刻意性’。那些规条存在，并不是为了折磨信徒，而是为了帮助他们中断那永无止境的忙碌循环，从而静止那台‘自我苛责的内在机器’。”

她在说什么？她在说：尽管她非常知道这些规条会被滥用、会变得压迫人，但我们这一代人与工作的关系已经严重失衡到一个地步，如果有人还以为“我累的时候就停一下”就真的能得安息，那实在是太天真了。

真正“安息”的能力——深度的安息——这是一个关乎生死的大事，没有人可以缺少它。但它既不自然，也不简单，绝对不容易，需要极大的操练和长期的习惯。


那为什么会这样？为什么“安息”会这么难？

首先，我们得看看现代处境（我只会很简略地讲）。现代世界把人类对安息的永恒需要，严重地放大和加剧了。让我用 A、B、C、D 四个趋势来说明：

A，工作越来越不稳定。至少在西方社会是这样。部门、岗位，如果不能持续创造利润，就会被砍掉。我不认为历史上有哪一个文化像今天这样，工作安全感这么低。

B，还有很多研究发现，以前公司里最高收入的人，大概拿的是基层员工的十倍、二十倍工资；现在却常常是一百、两百倍。部分地也是因为这个原因，收入高的人被期待投入巨量的工作时数——这是“理所当然”的；如果你不愿意做，后面有一整排人排队等位置。而收入低的人，则需要打好几份工，才能维持生计。也就是说，不管你在社会阶层的哪一端，每个人都在过劳。

C，科技。科技让你“可以在任何地方工作”，结果就是——你“会在每一个地方工作”。你很难阻止工作渗透进生命中的每一个角落。

D，最后一个趋势稍微复杂一点。文化分析家普遍同意：在传统社会里，人从家庭、从扮演特定的社会角色中获得意义——做父母、做子女、做兄弟姐妹，这些角色才是生命的中心。工作重要，但它只是谋生的手段；家庭才是一切的重心。

而我们是历史上第一个主流说法是：“你要透过‘决定自己想成为谁’，并且‘达成它’，来定义自己”的文化。你的人生意义，来自你自己选择、并且达成的东西。

这意味着什么？这意味着，工作从来没有像现在这样，背负着这么大的心理、社会与情感压力——必须要么极度有意义，要么至少非常赚钱。历史上从来没有一个文化像我们这样，把这么大的重量压在“工作”这个东西上。

A、B、C 让我们比任何时代都更需要安息，却也比任何时代都更没有安息的时间；D 则让我们在内心深处，比任何时代的人都更缺乏“安息和放松”的能力。


但就算现代情境如此糟糕、如此加剧问题，圣经里的“安息日”却是非常古老的实践。这就说明：人类里面还有一个更深层、一直都存在的问题——是安息日要对付的根本问题。

舒洛维茨在文章里就敏锐地看到了这一点。她说：

“当安息日还是神圣的时候，不只是琐碎的劳作被节日、家庭聚会、集体敬拜取代，更重要的是，那台‘自我审查的机器’也会关机，让人内心那永不停息的‘自责低语’得以安静下来。”

那“永不停息的自责低语”是什么？那台“内在自我审查的机器”是什么？

睡眠专家告诉我们：真正被恢复，不只是要“睡够时间”，还要有“足够深度”的睡眠，也就是我们熟悉的 REM（快速眼动）睡眠。

他们说，你需要连续睡一段时间，身体才会进入深度睡眠。如果你把八小时拆成八个一小时的小睡，你可以说“我睡满八小时了”，但第二天，你仍会精疲力竭。因为你从来没有进入过深层睡眠。

同样的，安息也不只是“外在的停工时间”，还需要“内在的深度安息”。

一方面，我们确实需要从外在的体力劳动中得着休息；但另一方面，在更深的里面，还有一种“更深层的工作”——那是“在一切工作之下的那份工作”。那就是舒洛维茨所说的“永不停息的自责低语”、“内在自我苛责的机器”。

那不是单纯的“罪疚感”，而是一种不间断的需要：不断地向自己、向别人证明“我是谁”“我有价值”。正是这一层“内在的工作”，让所有外在的工作都变得格外使人疲惫——真正的疲惫来自这里。

这种内在的工作，从来不会让你觉得“够了”。你永远不会觉得“证明完成了”，永远不会觉得“已经可以停下来”。

因此，如果你没有这种“深度的、灵魂层面的安息”，就算你一直放假、一直停工，你仍然会长期处在一种疲惫状态里。

所以，在所有大层面的休息、身体层面的休息之下，我们还有一个更深的需要：灵里的深度安息。


举个例子：还记得唯一好看的那一部《洛奇》吗？第一部。片中有人问洛奇：“你为什么这么拼命？你为什么要为了比赛付出这么多？”为什么他要在小意大利的街头拼命跑步、顶着号角声冲上费城美术馆的台阶？

洛奇的回答是：“我只想在拳击台上撑完全程。那样我就知道——我不是个废物（bum）。”

也就是说，我们的英雄是被那“永不停息的自责低语”、那“内在的审判机器”驱赶着。他必须证明自己不是废物，所以他才这样拼命训练、冲到顶点。也因此，他终究会筋疲力尽——也因此后面几部电影会变得那么糟糕。

他心里深处有一个深邃的“灵魂安息的缺口”，如果这个缺口不被填满，就算再多度假、再多休息，都救不了他。

所以，我们需要安息日的安息；我们从来没有像现在这样需要它。

这就是第一点：为什么我们需要安息。


第二点：我们从哪里得着这种安息？

看耶稣怎么回答那些控告他违背安息日的人。

他们说他犯了安息日，耶稣怎么回应？

他回答说：“经上记着大卫和跟随他的人饥饿之时所做的，你们没有念过吗？他怎么进了　神的殿，拿陈设饼吃，又给跟随他的人吃；这饼除了祭司以外，别人都不可吃。”

耶稣这里引用的是撒母耳记上 21 章的一件事——大卫逃命时，经过会幕。会幕里有“陈设饼”，放在圣所里，是安息日礼拜的一部分，按律法只有祭司可以吃。大卫却吃了，也给跟随他的人吃。

很有意思的是：上帝从来没有因为这件事责备大卫，圣经中也从没说大卫因此犯罪。

耶稣在这里邀请我们去推演这个例子背后的含义：

如果安息日和礼仪性的敬拜规条，在某些极端情况下可以被暂时搁置；但另一方面，我们从来没在圣经任何地方看到“道德律”在紧急情况下可以被搁置——上帝从来不会说：“因为你很急，所以犯奸淫没关系、拜偶像没关系、抢劫没关系。”

如果从来没有任何经文允许“道德律”在紧急时刻被暂时放下，但安息日和礼仪条例却曾在特别情形下被搁置，这说明什么？

这说明：安息日和礼仪条例是“预表性的”（provisional）。它们是暂时的，直到有一天，有一位“真正的实体”来了，使它们完成使命，可以“退场”。

那是谁？

耶稣立刻接着说：“人子是安息日的主。”

这是一个惊人的宣告。

他的意思至少包括：

“所有关于安息日的律法、规条，其实都在指向我。我才是那位真正能给你灵魂深处安息的主。我才是那位安息的主。”

耶稣在说：“我就是安息的主。”


这意味着两件事：

第一，如果你要得着真正的安息，你必须到他这里来。

第二，如果你觉得自己已经“到耶稣这里来”了，却仍毫无安息，那说明你还不真正明白，你在他里面到底拥有什么——你还没有真正“抓住”你在他里面已经拥有的东西。


那他怎么成为我们的安息之主？为什么他能？

让我带你去看另外几处关键经文。

今天的播客里，提姆·凯勒要帮助我们明白，福音如何使我们在自己的职业中，仍然能有盼望和喜乐。

今天读的经文来自路加福音第 6 章 1–11 节：

一个安息日，耶稣从麦地经过；他的门徒掐了麦穗，用手搓着吃。有几个法利赛人说：“你们做什么，是在安息日不可做的呢？”耶稣对他们说：“经上记着大卫和跟随他的人饥饿之时所做的，你们没有念过吗？

他怎么进了　神的殿，拿陈设饼吃，又给跟随他的人吃；这饼除了祭司以外，别人都不可吃。”又对他们说：“人子是安息日的主。”

又有一个安息日，耶稣进了会堂教训人。在那里有一个人右手枯干了。文士和法利赛人窥探耶稣，在安息日医病不医，好得把柄去控告他。耶稣却知道他们的意念，就对那枯干一只手的人说：“起来，站在当中！”那人就起来站着。

耶稣对他们说：“我问你们：在安息日行善行恶、救命害命，哪样是可以的呢？”他就周围看着他们众人，对那人说：“伸出手来！”他把手一伸，手就复了原。他们就满心大怒，彼此商议怎样处治耶稣。

这是上帝的话。


我们一直在查考路加福音，看耶稣的一生。好几个星期以来，我们都在看耶稣关于“跟随他”意味着什么、做门徒意味着什么的教导。其实，耶稣在做的一件事情，就是把福音——他是谁，他成就了什么——应用到人生每一个层面上。耶稣在说，门徒就是那些把福音应用到生命中每一个领域的人。

今天我们来到的是一个在十诫中被提到的领域——第四诫：出埃及记 20 章说：“六日要劳碌做你一切的工，但第七日是向耶和华你上帝当守的安息日；这一天，你和你的儿女、仆婢、牲畜，并你城里寄居的客旅，无论何工都不可做。因为六日之内，耶和华造天、地、海和其中的万物，第七日便安息。”这就是安息日的安息。


我知道，我们每个人和“工作”的关系都不太一样。

有些人现在失业，巴不得有更多的工作；也有人会对我说，他们的问题是缺乏工作上的自律。但总的来说，在纽约这样的城市中心，我们面临的最大问题之一，其实是“安息日的安息”——操练安息日、得着安息日安息的这个操练。

为什么我们需要它？我们从哪里得着它？我们要怎样实际去做？

为什么需要？从哪里得？要怎么做？这些问题，这段经文里都有答案。

首先，为什么我们需要安息？


看第 1–2 节：在一个安息日，耶稣和他的门徒从麦地经过，掐了麦穗，用手搓着吃，就被指控违背安息日。为什么呢？因为在当时的“哈拉卡”（宗教规条）里，收割谷物是安息日被禁止的三十九种劳作之一。

一听到这里，我们马上会说：太律法主义、太道德主义了，规条这么多，真可怕。我们会嗤之以鼻。但是注意耶稣的回应：

他不是说：“人子来是要废掉安息日，或者带你们超越这一切。”

他反而说：“人子是安息日的主。”

这句话，等一下我们会展开，但至少说明了一件事：耶稣在说，“我整个人，就是围绕安息日的。我来，就是要成就安息。”

这让我们一开始就学到一点：在整个人类历史上也许最“工作狂”的文化里，就是我们这个文化，绝对没有资格对那些想要给人真正安息的努力——即便有些方式很偏差、充满误用——嗤之以鼻。因为“安息”是让人活得像“人”的最关键要素之一。

朱迪思·舒洛维茨（Judith Shulevitz）是《纽约时报杂志》和书评版的作者。就在上个月三月的第一周，她在《纽约时报杂志》写了一篇文章，标题叫《把安息日带回来》（Bring Back the Sabbath）。

她先简短地交代了自己的背景：她在一个宗教社区里长大，常去会堂礼拜——大概也是在纽约，我不太确定。但像很多受过高等教育的世俗纽约职业人士一样，她后来基本上离开了自己宗教的成长背景。接着，她开始经历一个现象。她这样描述：

“每到周末，我的心情就会变得低落，到了周六下午，我几乎变得毫无反应、闷闷不乐。原本习惯和朋友一起吃早午餐，这些事突然都让我感到格外坐立难安。后来，我开始做一件 teenage 时代的我、那个被宗教教育深深劝退的我，从来想象不到会去做的事——我开始时不时走进附近的一间犹太会堂。”

“最终，我为自己的状况发展出了一个理论：如果说从前的人是被安息日折磨的（指各种规条），那现在的我，是被‘没有安息日’这件事折磨。”

“我们和工作的关系已经严重失衡，这一点证据太多了。请允许我为一个制度辩护——数千年来，这个制度帮助人类把工作狂的倾向限制在一个较为合理的范围之内。大多数人以为，停止工作只要‘不再工作’就好了。但发明安息日的那些人，比我们了解得多得多：他们看得清楚，这其实是一件复杂得多的事情。”

“你不可能随随便便就把自己降档慢下来。这就是为什么清教徒和犹太人的安息日传统如此强调‘刻意性’。那些规条存在，并不是为了折磨信徒，而是为了帮助他们中断那永无止境的忙碌循环，从而静止那台‘自我苛责的内在机器’。”

她在说什么？她在说：尽管她非常知道这些规条会被滥用、会变得压迫人，但我们这一代人与工作的关系已经严重失衡到一个地步，如果有人还以为“我累的时候就停一下”就真的能得安息，那实在是太天真了。

真正“安息”的能力——深度的安息——这是一个关乎生死的大事，没有人可以缺少它。但它既不自然，也不简单，绝对不容易，需要极大的操练和长期的习惯。

那为什么会这样？为什么“安息”会这么难？

首先，我们得看看现代处境（我只会很简略地讲）。现代世界把人类对安息的永恒需要，严重地放大和加剧了。让我用 A、B、C、D 四个趋势来说明：

A，工作越来越不稳定。至少在西方社会是这样。部门、岗位，如果不能持续创造利润，就会被砍掉。我不认为历史上有哪一个文化像今天这样，工作安全感这么低。

B，还有很多研究发现，以前公司里最高收入的人，大概拿的是基层员工的十倍、二十倍工资；现在却常常是一百、两百倍。部分地也是因为这个原因，收入高的人被期待投入巨量的工作时数——这是“理所当然”的；如果你不愿意做，后面有一整排人排队等位置。而收入低的人，则需要打好几份工，才能维持生计。也就是说，不管你在社会阶层的哪一端，每个人都在过劳。

C，科技。科技让你“可以在任何地方工作”，结果就是——你“会在每一个地方工作”。你很难阻止工作渗透进生命中的每一个角落。

D，最后一个趋势稍微复杂一点。文化分析家普遍同意：在传统社会里，人从家庭、从扮演特定的社会角色中获得意义——做父母、做子女、做兄弟姐妹，这些角色才是生命的中心。工作重要，但它只是谋生的手段；家庭才是一切的重心。

而我们是历史上第一个主流说法是：“你要透过‘决定自己想成为谁’，并且‘达成它’，来定义自己”的文化。你的人生意义，来自你自己选择、并且达成的东西。

这意味着什么？这意味着，工作从来没有像现在这样，背负着这么大的心理、社会与情感压力——必须要么极度有意义，要么至少非常赚钱。历史上从来没有一个文化像我们这样，把这么大的重量压在“工作”这个东西上。

A、B、C 让我们比任何时代都更需要安息，却也比任何时代都更没有安息的时间；D 则让我们在内心深处，比任何时代的人都更缺乏“安息和放松”的能力。

睡眠专家告诉我们：真正被恢复，不只是要“睡够时间”，还要有“足够深度”的睡眠，也就是我们熟悉的 REM（快速眼动）睡眠。

他们说，你需要连续睡一段时间，身体才会进入深度睡眠。如果你把八小时拆成八个一小时的小睡，你可以说“我睡满八小时了”，但第二天，你仍会精疲力竭。因为你从来没有进入过深层睡眠。

同样的，安息也不只是“外在的停工时间”，还需要“内在的深度安息”。

一方面，我们确实需要从外在的体力劳动中得着休息；但另一方面，在更深的里面，还有一种“更深层的工作”——那是“在一切工作之下的那份工作”。那就是舒洛维茨所说的“永不停息的自责低语”、“内在自我苛责的机器”。

那不是单纯的“罪疚感”，而是一种不间断的需要：不断地向自己、向别人证明“我是谁”“我有价值”。正是这一层“内在的工作”，让所有外在的工作都变得格外使人疲惫——真正的疲惫来自这里。

这种内在的工作，从来不会让你觉得“够了”。你永远不会觉得“证明完成了”，永远不会觉得“已经可以停下来”。

因此，如果你没有这种“深度的、灵魂层面的安息”，就算你一直放假、一直停工，你仍然会长期处在一种疲惫状态里。

所以，在所有大层面的休息、身体层面的休息之下，我们还有一个更深的需要：灵里的深度安息。


举个例子：还记得唯一好看的那一部《洛奇》吗？第一部。片中有人问洛奇：“你为什么这么拼命？你为什么要为了比赛付出这么多？”为什么他要在小意大利的街头拼命跑步、顶着号角声冲上费城美术馆的台阶？

洛奇的回答是：“我只想在拳击台上撑完全程。那样我就知道——我不是个废物（bum）。”

也就是说，我们的英雄是被那“永不停息的自责低语”、那“内在的审判机器”驱赶着。他必须证明自己不是废物，所以他才这样拼命训练、冲到顶点。也因此，他终究会筋疲力尽——也因此后面几部电影会变得那么糟糕。

他心里深处有一个深邃的“灵魂安息的缺口”，如果这个缺口不被填满，就算再多度假、再多休息，都救不了他。

所以，我们需要安息日的安息；我们从来没有像现在这样需要它。

这就是第一点：为什么我们需要安息。

第二点：我们从哪里得着这种安息？

看耶稣怎么回答那些控告他违背安息日的人。

他们说他犯了安息日，耶稣怎么回应？

他回答说：“经上记着大卫和跟随他的人饥饿之时所做的，你们没有念过吗？他怎么进了　神的殿，拿陈设饼吃，又给跟随他的人吃；这饼除了祭司以外，别人都不可吃。”

耶稣这里引用的是撒母耳记上 21 章的一件事——大卫逃命时，经过会幕。会幕里有“陈设饼”，放在圣所里，是安息日礼拜的一部分，按律法只有祭司可以吃。大卫却吃了，也给跟随他的人吃。

很有意思的是：上帝从来没有因为这件事责备大卫，圣经中也从没说大卫因此犯罪。

耶稣在这里邀请我们去推演这个例子背后的含义：

如果安息日和礼仪性的敬拜规条，在某些极端情况下可以被暂时搁置；但另一方面，我们从来没在圣经任何地方看到“道德律”在紧急情况下可以被搁置——上帝从来不会说：“因为你很急，所以犯奸淫没关系、拜偶像没关系、抢劫没关系。”

如果从来没有任何经文允许“道德律”在紧急时刻被暂时放下，但安息日和礼仪条例却曾在特别情形下被搁置，这说明什么？

这说明：安息日和礼仪条例是“预表性的”（provisional）。它们是暂时的，直到有一天，有一位“真正的实体”来了，使它们完成使命，可以“退场”。

那是谁？

耶稣立刻接着说：“人子是安息日的主。”

这是一个惊人的宣告。

他的意思至少包括：

“所有关于安息日的律法、规条，其实都在指向我。我才是那位真正能给你灵魂深处安息的主。我才是那位安息的主。”

耶稣在说：“我就是安息的主。”


这意味着两件事：

第一，如果你要得着真正的安息，你必须到他这里来。

第二，如果你觉得自己已经“到耶稣这里来”了，却仍毫无安息，那说明你还不真正明白，你在他里面到底拥有什么——你还没有真正“抓住”你在他里面已经拥有的东西。

那他怎么成为我们的安息之主？为什么他能？

让我带你去看另外几处关键经文。

先回到圣经中第一次“安息”的经文：创世记第一章末尾、第二章开头。当上帝创造完世界之后，经文这样说：

“神看着一切所造的都甚好……到第七日，神造物的工已经完毕，就在第七日歇了他一切的工。”

上帝在第七日“安息”——那是什么意思呢？难道上帝累了吗？上帝不会疲惫。如果上帝不会疲惫，“安息”在这里就不可能只是“从疲乏中恢复”。

那它是什么意思？

创世记的叙述里有一个很美的特点：上帝每创造完一样，就停下来、看一看，然后说：“这是好的。”接着再创造下一样，又说：“这是好的。”等到一切都完成了，他看着所有的一切，说：“甚好。”

这才是“安息”的意思：对已成就之工有完全的满足、完全的喜悦。

也就是说，只有当你对所做的一切完全满意、完全满足时，你才放得下工作，才肯真正停下来。这才叫“安息”。如果你心里总觉得“不够好”“还要再多一点”，你是停不下来的。

所以，从圣经的角度，“安息”的定义，就是“对已经完成之工的完全满意”。


接着我们往前翻到希伯来书第 4 章。那里在讲福音、讲信耶稣的意义时，突然这样说：

“既有必进安息的人，那先前听见福音的，因为不信从，不得进去……这样看来，必另有一安息日的安息，为神的子民存留……那进入神安息的人，乃是歇了自己的工，正如神歇了他的工一样。”

这是一段非常惊人的经文。

它在说：作基督徒的其中一个重要含义，就是你可以像上帝看他自己的工作那样，看你自己的人生和工作——你可以对自己的人生说：“这已经够了，已经完成了。”

通过耶稣，你可以在某种意义上“歇了自己的工”，像上帝在第七日“歇了他的工”一样。

那怎么可能？

这怎么可能？我们怎么可能像上帝那样，对自己所做的一切说：已经够了？已经完成了？

舒洛维茨在那篇精彩的文章里，再一次给出了非常深刻的洞见。她写道：

“就连我们那些集体的娱乐活动，也无法做到安息日礼仪曾经能做到的事情。光是‘停下工作去玩一玩’，远远不能给人从那‘永不停息的自责低语和自我审查机器’中得着真正的安息。”

“宗教的礼仪并不只是为了让大家在一起热闹热闹，它们被设计出来，是为了不断向我们重述一个故事——关于我们是谁的故事。安息日所讲述的故事，是关于创造：神安息，而我们也安息，为的是尊重我们里面那按上帝形象被造的尊严，并提醒自己：我们不只是我们的工作。”

她在某种程度上，几乎完全抓住了希伯来书作者想说的要点。

还记得我们前面说过的那份“在所有工作之下的工作”吗？

一方面有外在的工作；但真正让我们筋疲力尽的，其实不是外在工作的存在，而是“内在那份深层的劳作”——那就是：“我要证明我是谁。”

我要向别人、向自己证明：

“我不是废物。”
“我是有价值的。”
“我是重要的。”

而我们总是试图透过“做成某些事”来完成这种证明——正因为这样，工作才变得如此沉重。

宗教人士会说：“如果我活得很好、做了很多善事，上帝就会接纳我、赐福我。”

世俗人士表面上不讲上帝、不讲律法、不讲圣经，但他们的心其实在同一套运作机制之下：他们照样订立一套标准、目标，把整个自我形象建立在“能不能活出这些标准、达成这些目标”之上。

这就是“在所有工作之下的那份工作”。

你不断要证明自己，不断要向自己保证：“我是一个重要的人。”

但这份工作永远不会完成，永远不会结束。你从来不能在这样的处境下，对自己说：“这已经够好了。”也许偶尔有那么一天你觉得还不错，但明天呢？后天呢？你永远无法真正说：“已经完成了。”

你永远无法像上帝创造之后那样，看着自己的“工作”说：“甚好。”


而这正是希伯来书要告诉我们的：

“唯独在耶稣基督里，你才能得到这份安息。”

耶稣说：“凡劳苦担重担的人，可以到我这里来，我就使你们得安息。我心里柔和谦卑，你们当负我的轭，学我的样式；这样，你们心里就必得享安息。因为我的轭是容易的，我的担子是轻省的。”

他在说：每个人都在服侍某样东西；每个人都在试图从某样东西中获得身份认同。但只有当你让“我”成为你生命的中心、成为你意义的根基时，你才会得着真正的安息。只有通过我，你才会听见那句：“已经完成了。”


那怎么可能？耶稣怎么做到的？

答案在十字架上。

回到路加福音这段经文的最后一节，要把它和第 5 节放在一起看：

“他们就满心大怒，彼此商议怎样处治耶稣。”

为什么他们如此愤怒？因为当耶稣说“人子是安息日的主”的时候，他实际上在宣称：“我就是那位设立安息日的神、也是那位亲自来成就真正安息的主。”

这是在宣告自己与上帝同等。

对这些宗教领袖来说，这简直是大逆不道，他们的反应只能是：“我们必须对付他。”最后他们决定要把他除掉——要他死。

然而，讽刺的是：当他们把耶稣钉上十字架、以为自己成了“审判者”的时候，他们反而成就了耶稣“安息之主”的身份。

为什么？

以赛亚书 57:20 说：“恶人好像翻腾的海，不得平静；其中的水常涌出污秽和淤泥。耶和华说：‘恶人必不得平安。’”

哥林多后书 5:21 又说：“神使那无罪的，替我们成为罪，好叫我们在他里面成为神的义。”

在十字架上，你看到的是怎样的一位耶稣？

你看见他在呼喊，在挣扎，在极度不安之中。他为什么如此不得安息？

因为在那一刻，上帝把我们的罪全部归在他身上——那位“完全无罪”的，被当作罪来对待。天父转脸不顾，他就经历了那句经文所说：“恶人不得平安。”

他在十字架上承受的是“无限度的焦躁和不安”、宇宙级的“灵魂失眠”。

为什么？

为的是，当一切结束的时候，他可以说出那句惊人的话：“成了。”

“已经完成了。”

完成的是什么？

是所有为着拯救你、拯救我所必须完成的一切工——即便是对那种要求极端严格、永远觉得自己不够好、内心充满完美主义自责的良心来说，也已经“够了”。

耶稣一生过着你我应该活却活不出来的完全顺服的生命；又在十字架上承担了你我应该承担却承担不起的刑罚。这样，当你凭信心把自己交托给他的时候，发生了什么？

哥林多后书 5:21 说：

“神使那无罪的，替我们成为罪，好叫我们在他里面成为神的义。”

也就是说：

我们的罪算在耶稣身上；

耶稣的义算在我们身上。

从此，当父神看你——这位在基督里的人——他看见的，不再是你那永远不够好的表现，而是他儿子那完全完成的工作。

于是，他可以像创造完世界时那样，看着你说：“这是好的。”

你也因此可以从那台“永不停息的自我审查机器”前退后一步，对自己的生命说：“在基督里，已经完成了。”

你不再需要靠自己的工作、成就、人际评价、社会地位，来证明“我是谁”——因为那位唯一真正重要的旁观者、唯一真正有资格审判你的那一双眼睛，已经在基督里对你说：“这是我所爱的孩子，我所喜悦的。”

我们也因此可以从那台“永不停息的自我审查机器”前退后一步，对自己的生命说：“在基督里，已经完成了。”

你不再需要靠自己的工作、成就、人际评价、社会地位，来证明“我是谁”——因为那位唯一真正重要的旁观者、唯一真正有资格审判你的那一双眼睛，已经在基督里对你说：“这是我所爱的孩子，我所喜悦的。”

还记得电影《火战车》吗？那是少有的一部真正以“安息日”为主题的电影。

片中有两个主角。一个人完全停不下来，他是短跑选手。有人问他：“你为什么这么拼？为什么一定要去奥运拿金牌？”他的回答是：“我只有 10 秒钟——（指 100 米短跑）——10 秒钟来证明我存在的价值。”

他在说什么？他在说：“我必须靠这 10 秒钟来证明我是谁。”

这就是舒洛维茨所说的那份“在一切工作之下的工作”。

所以他被驱使着，拼命训练、拼命要赢。但就算最后拿到了金牌，也仍然不会够——因为明天还有比赛，后天还有人比他更快。那份真正让人疲惫的“内在工作”，从来不会完成。

另一方面，另一个主角发现决赛安排在主日，而他是一个认真守安息日的基督徒。

关键不在于一种律法主义的外在规条，而在于：他在基督里对“自己是谁”有足够的安全感，因此他愿意说：“我不跑。”即便这意味着可能失去一块金牌，他仍愿意这样做。

有趣的是，结果反而是：第一个人拿到了金牌，却仍不满足；第二个人失去金牌，却有深度的安息，因为他知道自己的价值不在金牌，而在基督里。

真正让你筋疲力竭的那份“底层工作”，只在耶稣基督里才会停下来。只有在他里面，天父对你说：“这是好的，是完成了的。”


只有当你先在福音里得着这样的“深度安息”，你才有可能真正实践“安息日”这件事——这就带我们进入第三点：我们到底要怎样实际活出安息日？

第三，我们要如何实际操练安息日？

如果你还没有在福音里得着那“深度的灵魂安息”，任何形式上的放假、休闲、旅游，都只会停留在表面；假期结束，你会发现自己比之前更累。只有当福音先在你里面动工，安息日的操练才真正有意义。

那在实践层面，我们可以学些什么？

回到这段经文：耶稣在安息日医治了那位枯干的手的人。

按当时的哈拉卡（宗教规条），如果病人快要死了，你可以在安息日施行医疗；但像这种“不至于马上死”的情况，是不能在安息日医治的。因此，从他们的角度看，耶稣是破坏了安息日。

注意，耶稣并没有说：“我之所以这样做，是因为安息日已经被废掉，我们不再需要安息日。”

他反而问：“在安息日行善行恶、救命害命，哪样是可以的呢？”

换句话说，他把在安息日做“恢复性”的工作（restorative work）——让那枯干的手得以复原——看成是安息日该做的事，而不是违背安息日。

这告诉我们：

一方面，耶稣成全了旧约关于安息日的预表，使我们不再被那些细枝末节的规条（走几步算超标、能不能提东西之类）所捆绑；

另一方面，他却非常清楚地肯定：安息日的原则本身仍然是必须被实践的。

对基督徒来说，麻烦反而更大：因为我们不再被上千条细则“外在地”约束着，我们更需要靠着圣灵，在福音里有意识、有操练地安排自己的时间，来实践“安息日的生活方式”。


凯勒在这里提出了几个“内在的操练”和“外在的操练”。

先说三个内在操练：

1）把安息日看成一个“解放的行动”。

申命记 5 章谈到安息日时，上帝说：“你要记念你在埃及地作过奴仆，耶和华你神用大能的手、伸出来的膀臂，将你从那里领出来，因此，耶和华你的神吩咐你守安息日。”

很有意思：上帝说，“你曾经是奴隶，但现在你不再是了——所以，要守安息日。”

换句话说：如果你不能停下来，如果你永远说不出“够了，我今天先到这里”，那你就是奴隶——也许是自我加给自己的奴役，也许是家庭期待、文化压力、公司文化的奴役。

所以，每一次你实际地停下来、拒绝继续工作，其实是在对自己宣告：“我不是奴隶。我的工作、客户、上司、同事、家人，甚至我自己的野心，都不是我的主人。基督才是我的主。”

守安息日，是一个属灵的“解放行动”。

2）把安息日看成一个“信靠的行动”。

安息日不只是解放你脱离“我是奴隶”的谎言，它也提醒你：“我不是上帝。”

你必须在心里对自己说：“世界不会因为我停工一天就崩塌；家庭的供养者不是我，是神；掌管我前途的也不是我，是神。”

换句话说，安息日是一种很实际的信心操练：

“我可以把手上的事放下，因为最终掌权的不是我，是神。”

如果你不习惯停下来，很可能是因为你在心底深处，相信“所有事情都要靠我扛”。

3）把安息日看成一个“福音的行动”。

每一次你停下工作，每一次你拒绝被那台“自我审查机器”继续驱赶，你都在向自己重申福音：

“我不是靠工作成绩、学历、薪水、侍奉成果来称义，我是靠基督已经完成的工作被称义。”

在这一层意义上，安息日本身就是一个“活出来的福音见证”。

凯勒在这里提出了几个“内在的操练”和“外在的操练”。

先说三个内在操练：

1）把安息日看成一个“解放的行动”。

申命记 5 章谈到安息日时，上帝说：“你要记念你在埃及地作过奴仆，耶和华你神用大能的手、伸出来的膀臂，将你从那里领出来，因此，耶和华你的神吩咐你守安息日。”

很有意思：上帝说，“你曾经是奴隶，但现在你不再是了——所以，要守安息日。”

换句话说：如果你不能停下来，如果你永远说不出“够了，我今天先到这里”，那你就是奴隶——也许是自我加给自己的奴役，也许是家庭期待、文化压力、公司文化的奴役。

所以，每一次你实际地停下来、拒绝继续工作，其实是在对自己宣告：“我不是奴隶。我的工作、客户、上司、同事、家人，甚至我自己的野心，都不是我的主人。基督才是我的主。”

守安息日，是一个属灵的“解放行动”。

2）把安息日看成一个“信靠的行动”。

安息日不只是解放你脱离“我是奴隶”的谎言，它也提醒你：“我不是上帝。”

你必须在心里对自己说：“世界不会因为我停工一天就崩塌；家庭的供养者不是我，是神；掌管我前途的也不是我，是神。”

换句话说，安息日是一种很实际的信心操练：

“我可以把手上的事放下，因为最终掌权的不是我，是神。”

如果你不习惯停下来，很可能是因为你在心底深处，相信“所有事情都要靠我扛”。

3）把安息日看成一个“福音的行动”。

每一次你停下工作，每一次你拒绝被那台“自我审查机器”继续驱赶，你都在向自己重申福音：

“我不是靠工作成绩、学历、薪水、侍奉成果来称义，我是靠基督已经完成的工作被称义。”

在这一层意义上，安息日本身就是一个“活出来的福音见证”。

接下来是外在的操练。凯勒大致提了五个方向：

1）刻意“增加”安息的时间。

具体需要多少时间，每个人情况不同，但可以确定的是：大多数现代城市人现在留给安息的时间，都太少了。

2）平衡地使用安息时间。

也就是说，在安息时间里，你要有：

- 一些“副业式”的活动（avocational）——做一些平常工作中不会做、但你享受的事；
- 一些“沉思式”的活动（contemplative）——包括敬拜、祷告、默想福音；
- 还有一些“什么都不计划”的时间（inactive）——允许自己发呆、随意想、随意感受。

如果你平常的工作是动脑为主，那“副业式”活动可能是动手的、动身体的；如果你平常是体力劳动者，安息时也许可以多一点阅读、音乐、艺术之类的滋养。

“沉思式”活动非常关键——就像舒洛维茨说的：你若只是从工作撤退，却没有一个“更大的故事”来告诉你“你是谁”，你的灵魂不会真正休息。因此，聚会、敬拜、听道、读经、祷告，都是安息日的核心部分。

而“什么都不计划”的那部分，其实对应着旧约里“地要享受安息年”的观念——地在那一年里不被耕种，不特别播种什么，只让它自己长出本来就会长出来的东西。你也需要这种“让心田自己长东西”的时间。没有安排、没有目标、没有绩效。

3）为自己的安息设立“外在的问责”。

现实里，有些阶段你不得不长期过劳——例如住院医生训练、创业初期等。但如果没有别人帮你守住界线，这种“临时的过劳阶段”非常容易变成“常态”。

凯勒就提到，他刚到纽约植堂时，曾答应妻子和孩子：“我会过劳一段时间，但三年后一定会调回正常节奏。”结果三年多过去了，仍然毫无改变。直到有一天，他回家时听见阳台传来“盘子被敲碎”的声音，才发现妻子在用一种非常“戏剧化”、却又极其聪明的方式提醒他——你已经超线太久了。

我们的重点不是效法她敲盘子，而是学习：

你需要找人一起商量、一起监督，彼此提醒：“这个季节结束之后，我们真的要调节了。”

4）在工作里“刻意压低生产力上限”。

旧约有“不可收割田角”的律法，也就是所谓的“拾穗制度”：农夫收割庄稼时不能割到田地的最边缘，要故意留下角落给穷人拾取。这是一种对“效率最大化”的刻意限制。

对我们而言，这意味着：我们不能一味追求“能接多少就接多少、能做多少就做多少”。我们要刻意设定一个“不过度挤压”的上限——即便这可能意味着在职场上“落后”于那些什么都不管、只顾拼命往上爬的人。

上帝可能仍然赐你成功，也可能让你在某些世俗指标上“落后一些”。但无论如何，你会更健康、更有人味，也更能在工作中见证福音。

5）在群体中一起思考“怎样安息”。

你很难一个人把这些都想透，也很难一个人长期坚持。你需要和同领域、同处境的基督徒一起讨论：在我们这个行业里，要怎样实际地“守安息日”？在我们这个公司文化下，怎样设界线才现实？

这些讨论，本身就是在“共同抵抗”那股要把我们全部变成机器、变成奴隶的文化力量。

接下来是外在的操练。凯勒大致提了五个方向：

1）刻意“增加”安息的时间。

具体需要多少时间，每个人情况不同，但可以确定的是：大多数现代城市人现在留给安息的时间，都太少了。

2）平衡地使用安息时间。

也就是说，在安息时间里，你要有：

- 一些“副业式”的活动（avocational）——做一些平常工作中不会做、但你享受的事；
- 一些“沉思式”的活动（contemplative）——包括敬拜、祷告、默想福音；
- 还有一些“什么都不计划”的时间（inactive）——允许自己发呆、随意想、随意感受。

如果你平常的工作是动脑为主，那“副业式”活动可能是动手的、动身体的；如果你平常是体力劳动者，安息时也许可以多一点阅读、音乐、艺术之类的滋养。

最后，凯勒把一切拉回到福音本身：

“那位你唯一真正需要讨好、唯一真正有资格审判你的上帝，如今在基督里看着你说：‘这是好的。已经完成了。’”

当这句话在你心里扎根，你对工作的态度就会慢慢改变。你既不用躲避工作，也不用被工作吞噬；你可以用自由的心去工作，也可以勇敢地停下来休息。

让这句“已经成了”深入你的生命，安息日就不再只是一条外在的规条，而会变成你整个人生的一种节奏、一种从福音而来的自由。

最后，凯勒以祷告结束：

“天父，我们感谢你，因你赐给我们所需要的一切，使我们可以有深度的平安和稳定。因为我们知道，耶稣基督已经完成了所有必须完成的工作。求你帮助我们，看见福音如何医治我们的完美主义、我们的过劳，也医治那些因为害怕失败而逃避工作的心。

愿我们在基督已经完成的工作里得着真正的安息，好叫我们在一切的工作与休息中，都活在你的面前。奉耶稣的名，阿们。”

——

在基督里“已经成了”的事实，是安息日的根基；
在这样的根基上，工作与安息才都能回到应有的位置。
