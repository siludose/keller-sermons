### Introduction: The Struggle with Work

Are you struggling to find meaning and purpose in your work? We spend much of our lives at our jobs, but our work can often be the area where we feel the most frustration and futility in our lives. Today on the podcast, Tim Keller helps us understand how the Gospel frees us to have hope and joy in our vocations.

Now the scripture this morning is from Luke's Gospel chapter 6 verses 1 through 11.

> One Sabbath, Jesus was going through the grain fields and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain, rub them in their hands and ate the kernels. Some of the Pharisees asked, why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath? Jesus answered them, have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? He entered the house of God and taking the consecrated bread, he ate what is lawful only for priests to eat, and he also gave some to his companions. Then Jesus said to them, the son of man is Lord of the Sabbath.

**On another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching and a man was there whose right hand was shriveled. The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath. But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled hand, get up and stand in front of everyone. So he got up and stood there. Then Jesus said to them, I ask you which is lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil to save life or to destroy it. He looked around at them all and then said to the man, stretch out your hand. He did so and his hand was completely restored, but they were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus.**

This is God's word.

### The Need for Sabbath Rest

We're looking at the book of Luke and the life of Jesus in the book of Luke. For a number of weeks we've been looking at Jesus' teaching about what it means to follow him, what it means to be his disciple and of course Jesus is essentially taking the gospel, who he is, what he did. And he's saying his disciples are people who apply the gospel to absolutely every single area of life.

And today we come to an area that is referred to. It's covered in the fourth commandment of the Ten Commandments. It's in Exodus 20.

> Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord, your God. On it you shall not do any work for on the seventh day the Lord rested.

Sabbath rests. Now I know that we all have somewhat different relationships to work. There are people here for example who are out of work and would love to have more work. There are people here who in general have said to me that they have a problem with work with discipline, but by and large in New York City, in the middle of New York City, the biggest problem we have, one of the biggest problems we have is Sabbath rest, the discipline of the getting of Sabbath rest.

**Why do we need it? Where do we get it? How do we do it? Why do we need it? Where do we get it? How do we do it? It's all here.**

### Where to Find True Rest

First of all, why do we need it? Look at verse 1-2. Jesus and His disciples were going through a field on a Sabbath day, and they picked some heads of grain, rubbed them in their hands to eat the kernels, and they were condemned. They were accused of breaking the Sabbath by the Pharisees, and that's because reaping grain was one of the 39 forms of work that was forbidden on the Sabbath day by the halaka at the time, which is the religious regulations.

As soon as you hear that, this was breaking the Sabbath to just take the heads off of grain and rub them in your hands and get the kernels out and eat them. Right away we say, oh, we say how legalistic, how moralistic, all those rules, how awful. We turn up our nose at it, but notice Jesus' response is not the Son of Man has come to do away with the Sabbath, or to get us beyond all this. That's not what he says. He says the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath, and we'll get to that in a second, but it means at least this, that I'm all about the Sabbath. The Sabbath is what I'm all about, which means here's what we learn to start with.

**The most workaholic culture in the history of the world, it's us, dare not, turn up its nose at any effort, even misguided efforts, to give to people one of the things most crucial to making life even human, which is rest.**

### How to Practice Sabbath Rest

Judith Schulovitz, who is a writer for the New York Times magazine, probably in New York Times book review, she wrote an article in New York Times magazine just this last month in the first week of March called Bring Back the Sabbath, and she says this.

First of all, she gives a little bit of background on herself. She says she was raised probably in New York, I'm not sure, but she was raised in a religious community at a synagogue, but like the average professional secular New Yorker, she resisted and basically moved away from her religious upbringing, and then she began to experience a phenomenon. Here's how she describes it.

> My mood would darken every weekend. Until by Saturday afternoon, I'd be unresponsive and morose. My normal routine, which involved brunch with friends, made me feel impossibly restless. Then I began to do something that, as a teenager, profoundly put off by her religious education, I could never have imagined ever wanting to do. I began dropping in on a nearby synagogue. Finally, I developed a theory for my condition. If formerly people suffered from the Sabbath, which means all the regulations, I now was suffering from the lack thereof.

There is ample evidence that our relationship to work is out of whack. Let me argue on behalf of an institution that has kept work of holism and reasonable check for thousands of years. Most people mistakenly believe that all you have to do to stop working is to not work. But the inventors of the Sabbath understood that it was a much more complicated undertaking. You cannot downshift casually and easily. This is why the Puritan and Jewish Sabbaths were so exactly intentional. The rules did not exist to torture the faithful. Interrupting the ceaseless round of striving requires a surprisingly strenuous act of the will. One that has to be bolstered by habit, as well as by social sanction.

And what she's saying is simply this. In spite of the fact she knows about, she recognizes the potential for abuse. Our relationship to work as a society is so seriously out of whack. That anyone who thinks that you're going to be able to get rested by simply knocking off whenever you feel tired is hopelessly naive.

**The ability to rest, deeply rest, is a life or death thing. No one can do without it. But it is not natural. It is not simple. It is absolutely difficult. And it takes an enormous amount of discipline and practice.**

### 引言：工作的挣扎

你是否在努力寻找工作中的意义和目标？我们大部分的生活都在工作中度过，但工作往往是我们感到最沮丧和徒劳的领域。今天在播客中，Tim Keller 帮助我们理解福音如何使我们在职业中获得希望和喜悦。

今天早上的经文来自路加福音第六章第一至十一节。

> 安息日，耶稣经过麦田，门徒掐了些麦穗，用手搓着吃了。有些法利赛人问，为什么你们在安息日做不合法的事？耶稣回答他们，难道你们没有读过大卫和跟随他的人饥饿时所做的事吗？他进了神的殿，拿了陈设饼吃了，这饼只有祭司才可以吃，他也给了跟随他的人。于是耶稣对他们说，人子是安息日的主。

**在另一个安息日，他进了会堂教导，有一个右手枯干的人在那里。法利赛人和律法教师寻找控告耶稣的理由，所以他们密切观察他是否会在安息日治病。但耶稣知道他们的心思，对那枯干手的人说，起来，站在众人面前。他就起来站着。耶稣对他们说，我问你们，在安息日行善还是作恶，救命还是害命，哪样是合法的？他环顾四周，对那人说，伸出你的手。他照做了，手就完全复原了，但他们非常愤怒，开始彼此商议如何对付耶稣。**

这是上帝的话。

### 安息日休息的必要性

我们正在看路加福音和耶稣在路加福音中的生活。几周以来，我们一直在研究耶稣关于跟随他的教导，成为他的门徒意味着什么，当然，耶稣本质上是在传递福音，他是谁，他做了什么。他说他的门徒是那些将福音应用于生活每个领域的人。

今天我们来到一个被提到的领域。它在十诫的第四条诫命中被涵盖。它在出埃及记二十章。

> 六日要劳碌做你一切的工，但第七日是向耶和华你神当守的安息日。这一天你不可做任何工，因为在第七日耶和华休息了。

安息日的休息。现在我知道我们每个人对工作的关系都有些不同。这里有些人失业，渴望有更多的工作。这里有些人一般对我说他们在工作纪律上有问题，但大体上在纽约市，在纽约市的中心，我们最大的问题之一是安息日的休息，获取安息日休息的纪律。

**为什么我们需要它？我们从哪里得到它？我们怎么做？为什么我们需要它？我们从哪里得到它？我们怎么做？这一切都在这里。**

### 在哪里找到真正的安息

首先，为什么我们需要它？看看第一到第二节。耶稣和他的门徒在安息日经过一块田地，他们掐了些麦穗，用手搓着吃了麦粒，他们被指责。法利赛人指责他们违反了安息日，因为在当时的哈拉卡中，收割麦穗是安息日禁止的三十九种工作之一，这是宗教法规。

一听到这个，我们就会说，哦，我们说多么律法主义，多么道德主义，所有这些规则，多么可怕。我们对此嗤之以鼻，但注意耶稣的回应不是人子来是要废掉安息日，或超越这一切。他没有这么说。他说人子是安息日的主，我们稍后会谈到这点，但至少意味着我是关于安息日的。安息日是我的全部，这意味着我们从一开始就学到的。

**历史上最工作狂的文化，就是我们，不敢对任何努力，即使是误导的努力，嗤之以鼻，因为这些努力是为了给人们提供使生活甚至是人性化的最关键的东西，即休息。**

### 如何实践安息日休息

Judith Schulovitz 是《纽约时报》杂志的作家，可能在《纽约时报》书评中，她在三月的第一个星期在《纽约时报》杂志上写了一篇文章，题为《带回安息日》，她这样说。

首先，她给出了一些关于她自己的背景。她说她可能是在纽约长大的，我不确定，但她是在一个宗教社区的犹太教堂长大的，但像大多数专业的世俗纽约人一样，她抵制并基本上远离了她的宗教背景，然后她开始经历一种现象。她这样描述它。

> 我的情绪每个周末都会变得阴郁。直到周六下午，我会变得无反应和忧郁。我的正常日常活动，包括与朋友共进早午餐，使我感到无法安宁。然后我开始做一些作为青少年时被宗教教育深深打击的事情，我从未想过会想做。我开始偶尔去附近的犹太教堂。最后，我为我的状况发展出一个理论。如果以前的人因安息日而受苦，这意味着所有的规定，我现在因缺乏而受苦。

有充分的证据表明我们与工作的关系失衡。让我为一个已经保持工作狂合理检查数千年的机构辩护。大多数人错误地认为停止工作只需不工作即可。但安息日的发明者明白这是一项更复杂的任务。你不能随意轻松地减速。这就是为什么清教徒和犹太人的安息日如此精确的原因。规则不是为了折磨信徒。中断无休止的努力循环需要一种出乎意料的意志力。这需要习惯和社会制裁的支持。

她所说的很简单。尽管她知道并承认潜在的滥用。我们作为一个社会与工作的关系严重失衡。任何认为你可以通过简单地在感到疲倦时停止工作来获得休息的人都是无可救药的天真。

**深度休息的能力是生死攸关的事情。没有人能没有它。但这不是自然的。这不是简单的。这是绝对困难的。它需要大量的纪律和实践。**
