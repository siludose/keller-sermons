### Introduction: Emmanuel

Christianity isn't just a spiritual practice or set of moral teachings. At its heart, it's the person of Jesus actively pursuing us. In today's teaching, Tim Keller impacts how Jesus actively seeks us, reveals truth to us, and calls us to Himself. Gospel of Matthew, chapter 1, verses 20 to 23.

> But after Joseph had considered this, the people of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son and you are to give him the name Jesus, because He will save his people from their sins. All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet. The Virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son and they will call him Emanuel, which means God with us. This is God's Word.

If there's one word that sums up Christmas, it comes up all the time in Scripture readings and in the carols at all the services, it's the word **Emanuel, Emanuel**. It means God with us. And it's only got in English eight letters. And yet I tell you it is heavier than the heavens and the earth.

### The Offensiveness and Attractiveness of Emmanuel

I would like to open it up for a moment this morning and I would propose to you that in that one word, Emanuel, you have the most offensive and the most comforting, the most repulsive and the most attractive message that the world has ever heard. It's the most repulsive and the most attractive. It's the most repulsive because it says Jesus Christ is God and it's the most attractive because it says Jesus Christ is God with us.

Look. First of all, it tells us that Jesus Christ is God. It's ironic that of all the Christian holidays, this is the one that's most broadly accepted and so popular. It's ironic because of all the Christian holidays, this particular holiday celebrates the one Christian doctrine which is the most offensive, the most in your face. And seemingly, I said seemingly, the most exclusive.

### The Only Wayness of Christianity

You see, Easter says our founder Jesus Christ was raised from the dead. What's offensive about that? It's great. Great. He rose into the dead, he triumphed over death. Even Lent in Good Friday says that our founder Jesus Christ died for our sins and even that. What's offensive about that? Sacrifice is great to die for your friends, it's noble.

But Christmas, at Christmas we say, our founder Jesus Christ is not just a human teacher, the way the Western scientific skeptics would say, and not just a manifestation of divine principle, a manifestation of divine consciousness, like the Eastern philosophers and mystics would say, Christmas tells us that Jesus Christ is the creator God Himself, the transcendent God Himself, who uniquely once and for all became a human being.

This sets Christianity utterly apart from everyone else. This sets Christianity on a collision course with what every other philosophy or religion says about the nature of God. Because over here in the West you have both Jews and Muslims that say God could never become human. But then over in the East you've got the Hindus and the Buddhists that are saying God continually becomes human. And Christianity won't have anything to do with either.

### Radical Inclusivity of Christianity

Because Christianity says that what happened at Christmas was that the transcendent creator God once and for all took upon Himself human nature. See Eastern religion believes that God is constantly manifesting, is constantly manifest in human beings. It's constantly being reborn. But the doctrine of reincarnation is not at all the doctrine of incarnation, which is what Christmas is about, in which Christians believe and the Bible proclaims that Jesus Christ became once and for all human who was the transcendent creator God.

Now that's very offensive to people. And that brings about what Christians, I guess you could call, only wayness. You know, Jesus says, I am the way of the truth in the life. No one comes to the Father but by me, he says in John 14, that's, there it is, only wayness let's call it. And many people are so offended and so irritated by it. And they say, I could accept classic Christianity. I love everything about classic Christianity except for that only wayness. But I can't stand. It's too exclusive, they say.

Now let's say a couple things about that quickly. First of all, the only wayness of Jesus Christ, the only wayness of Christianity is not an intolerant attitude. Ah, people say that's the problem. If it was only, if only Christians could get rid of that intolerance, if they could only get rid of that exclusive attitude, then I could handle it a lot better. But don't you see? The only wayness of Christianity is not an attitude, it's not a psychological thing. It's intrinsic to, it's part and parcel of what Christmas actually proclaims.

### Conclusion: Emmanuel as the Medicine

Put it this way, it has nothing to do with attitude. If you want to get rid of the only wayness of Christianity, you can't ask Christians just to sort of loosen up their attitude. You have to destroy Christmas, you have to take it away forever.

Then there's a man who's very rich, and before he dies, he buries an incredible treasure, and he says it's somewhere in Wyoming, Montana, or Ohio, and then he dies. And of course, a lot of people want to find it, but it's hopeless. Who in the world could ever find a treasure buried somewhere in such a vast track?

Then all of a sudden, a small group of people come up and they publicly proclaim that they have found, from the hand of the man who had buried the treasure, the treasure map. The map that tells right where it is. And they say, we have the map.

Now, how would the discussion go? On the one hand, there'd be some people who say, they have the map, and therefore they know the way to the treasure. And on the other hand, there'd be people who say, they don't have the map. And therefore, they don't have the way to the treasure. But there would be nobody who would rationally say, what gives you the right to think you have the map? Because you see, it's not a matter of tolerance. It's a matter of whether that's the map or not.

Nobody would say, what gives you the right? How dare anyone think that they know the way to the treasure? That's silly. And in the same way, when Jesus says, I'm the way, the truth, and the life, no one comes to the Father but through me. You can't say, why don't you just loosen up, Jesus? Why don't you just loosen up Christians? Why don't you just have a more tolerant attitude? It's not an issue of tolerance. Is he the map?

We have the only religion. The only founder of any religion who claims to be God. Is he the map or not? Either he is, and he's the way, because no other founder of any other religion claimed to be such a personage, or he's not the map and he's not a way, but how dare anybody say, how dare you even think that you had to have the right to have the map? Don't you see?

And therefore, the only way to get rid of the only wayness of Christianity is to destroy Christmas because that's the premise on which it's based.

You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward, younger brother. In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who try to earn his love by being good. In his book, The prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental older brother, and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal, extravagant grace.

Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith, The prodigal God will help you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way. The prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the hope and joy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the world. Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash give that's gospelandlife.com slash give.

But before you try to destroy Christmas, that is, and get all the retailers on Fifth Avenue very mad at you whether or not they believe. I would suggest to you for a moment that you are wrong if you think the Christianity is an exclusive religion and that Christmas makes it an exclusive religion. All my friends, Christmas is telling us that Christianity is a radically inclusive religion and here's what I mean.

When you hear someone say, ah yes, Christians believe they have to believe in Jesus to get to God. Well, I believe that all good people, all worthy people, all decent and moral and loving people, no matter what they believe, can find God. Does that sound more inclusive to you? I tell you that is actually a form of very, very narrow exclusivity.

And here's why a person who says that may look more inclusive than a Christian, but actually their premise is that morality and goodness is enough to find God. That's their premise. Their premise is that that's enough to be loving, to be compassionate. That's enough to find the divine, that's enough to find the good. Anyone they say who is really wonderful and loving and disciplined and diligent and able can find God, what about the rest of us?

You exclusive types who say anybody, no matter what they believe, any good person can find God. What about those of us who are not disciplined? What about those of us who are not unselfish? What about those of us who have lived lives in our record when we look at it, we're not proud of it at all? What about those of us who are nervous wrecks?

Don't you see, you're so called exclusivity and basically all religions and all philosophies outside of Christianity say the same thing. They say here's how you should live a good and decent and moral life and anyone who lives a good and decent moral life can find the divine. That's radically exclusive because that means that your religion is only for the able, only for the discipline, only for the good. What about us failures?

See Christianity is radically inclusive. It's the one religion that says no matter who you are, no matter what you've done, no matter what your record is. You can unite with God. You can be welcomed into his family because all other religions say we've got, here's what to do. Let's go to God. Christianity says God's come to us and he's come in the form of a person and all you have to do is believe in him, grab hold of him.

When John the Baptist says to Jesus, how do we know you're the one to come? And Jesus says, Matthew 11, he says this, he says look it, the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the poor have good news for each of them, the lepers, the poor, the outcast, the failures, the marginal people, the people that every other religion so-called inclusive religions to say all good and able when cultured people are able to find God. I have a religion says Jesus that's radically inclusive, that brings them all in because I'm not a prophet telling you how to get to God, I'm God who's come to you, I'm in man you well, I am God with you.

It says in 1 Corinthians 1, the same kind of thing. Paul says consider your calling my friends, he says to the Christian church there. Not many of you were wise, not many of you were influential, not many of you were of noble birth, but God chose the foolish things to shame the wise, God chose the weak things to shame the strong, God chose the despised things and even the things that are not to bring to nothing, the things that are that no one will boast in its presence.

Don't you see Christianity is radically inclusive, it doesn't just include the strong, but the weak, not just the wise, but the foolish. Everything else about Christianity makes no sense without Christmas. Jesus is God and that's why his death is so valuable, otherwise his death is of limited significance. Jesus says God and that's why his claims make sense. Jesus says God and that's why it does make all other religions obsolete. Oh, you hate to hear that because it's so much more radically inclusive than they are.

Jesus says no matter who you are, no matter what you've done, take hold of me, rest of me, all you need is need, all you need is nothing. See, repulsive and attractive at once, he is not only God but God with us.

Listen friends, as I conclude, let me just point this out to you. This is a medicine chest, Christmas is a medicine chest in which you've got the medicine to heal whatever ails you. And I wish you saw that and I every year I try to break through the sentimental feelings and the nostalgic feelings that you get whenever you come to a Christmas service. I want you to see what's really there.

Let me give you just a couple real quick examples. Some of you have guilty consciences today. Like Lady Macbeth, you're walking around and you can't get out that damn spot. And somebody's told you, well, this is low self esteem, but if you're more candid, it's guilt. You failed, you've come up short and you are trying to pay for it and you'll never understand your life until you begin to understand it in terms of moral economics.

You're trying to pay for your failures with your tears or you're trying to pay with your good deeds or you're trying to pay with your accomplishments or with your achievements or you're trying to pay through self destructive behavior or you're trying to pay through rescuing people with them, you're trying to pay.

Look at Jesus through Emmanuel. Who was it that died on the cross for you? God. Not just anybody, not just a nice guy, God. It says in Acts 20 verse 28, God redeemed us with his own blood, the blood of God. What is that worth? Anything. So stop trying to pay. Stop trying to get that damn spot out, as the lady Macbeth would say, with your tears and with your efforts, come to him, he's a man you will. He died for you. God died for you. One drop of his blood will pay for anything. You can put it behind you. You've got to stop there.

Don't you see, Emmanuel is a medicine that will handle anything. But most of all, let me say now what I said at the beginning of the service, Emmanuel is all about God coming to be with us. And if God, the great God of the universe, would become a wriggling little baby for us, what should you be willing to do to get near him? It cost him tremendously to get near us. It's going to cost you something to get near him, but nothing like what it cost him.

You're going to have to give up your sins. You're going to have to give up your life. You may have to give up a lot more of your time. But if you have a God who's willing to come this far to get near you, don't you think that when you make the effort to get near him, he'll respond, claw, clutch, crawl, do anything to get near this God. Or there's anything in your life keeping you away from him now, get rid of it. He's God with us, Emmanuel. Come to him, let's pray.

Father, we ask now that you would grant to us to see the repulsive attractiveness of this great truth. We pray that you would help us to use it on our lives and use it on our hearts so that we would see the radical grace that's therein. And we would also see that this is something that will cure us of anything, no matter what we've done, no matter where we are, no matter how far away we are, we can come near because your son came to us. We pray that you'd help us by your Holy Spirit to apply these great truths to our hearts and our lives now. We ask it in Jesus' name, amen.

### 引言：以马内利

基督教不仅仅是一种灵修实践或一套道德教义。其核心是耶稣这个人主动追求我们。在今天的教导中，Tim Keller 讲述了耶稣如何积极地寻找我们，向我们揭示真理，并呼召我们归向他。马太福音第 1 章第 20 至 23 节。

> 约瑟正思念这事的时候，主的使者在梦中向他显现，说：“大卫的子孙约瑟，不要怕，只管娶过你的妻子马利亚来，因为她所怀的孕是从圣灵来的。她将要生一个儿子，你要给他起名叫耶稣，因为他要将自己的百姓从罪恶里救出来。”这一切的事成就是要应验主借先知所说的话，说：“必有童女怀孕生子，人要称他的名为以马内利。”（以马内利翻出来就是“神与我们同在”。）这是神的话。

如果有一个词可以总结圣诞节，那就是在经文阅读和所有礼拜中的圣诗中经常出现的词，那就是 **以马内利，以马内利**。它的意思是神与我们同在。而在英文中只有八个字母。然而，我告诉你，它比天地还要重。

### 以马内利的冒犯性与吸引力

我想在今天早上打开这个词片刻，我向你们提出，在这个词“以马内利”中，你有世界上听过的最具冒犯性和最安慰的，最令人反感和最吸引人的信息。它是最令人反感和最吸引人的。它最令人反感，因为它说耶稣基督是神，而它最吸引人，因为它说耶稣基督是与我们同在的神。

看。首先，它告诉我们耶稣基督是神。讽刺的是，在所有的基督教节日中，这是最广泛接受和最受欢迎的一个。讽刺的是，在所有的基督教节日中，这个特定的节日庆祝的是最具冒犯性、最直截了当的基督教教义。表面上看，我说表面上看，最排他的。

### 基督教的唯一性

你看，复活节说我们的创始人耶稣基督从死里复活。这有什么冒犯的？太好了。太好了。他从死里复活，他战胜了死亡。即使是大斋期和受难日也说我们的创始人耶稣基督为我们的罪而死，即使是这样。这有什么冒犯的？为朋友牺牲是伟大的，是高尚的。

但圣诞节，在圣诞节我们说，我们的创始人耶稣基督不仅仅是一个人类教师，就像西方科学怀疑论者所说的那样，也不仅仅是神圣原则的体现，神圣意识的体现，就像东方哲学家和神秘主义者所说的那样，圣诞节告诉我们耶稣基督是创造者神自己，是超越的神自己，独特地一次性地成为了一个人类。

这使得基督教完全不同于其他所有宗教。这使得基督教与其他所有哲学或宗教关于神的本质的说法发生冲突。因为在西方，你有犹太人和穆斯林，他们说神永远不能成为人类。但在东方，你有印度教徒和佛教徒，他们说神不断地成为人类。而基督教不接受任何一种。

### 基督教的彻底包容性

因为基督教说圣诞节发生的事情是超越的创造者神一次性地取了人性。看，东方宗教相信神不断地显现，不断地在人类中显现。它不断地重生。但轮回的教义根本不是道成肉身的教义，这就是圣诞节的意义所在，基督徒相信并且圣经宣称耶稣基督一次性地成为了人类，他是超越的创造者神。

这对人们来说是非常冒犯的。这带来了基督徒所说的唯一性。你知道，耶稣说，我是道路、真理和生命。没有人能到父那里去，若不借着我，他在约翰福音 14 章中说，这就是唯一性，让我们称之为唯一性。许多人对此感到非常冒犯和恼火。他们说，我可以接受经典基督教。我喜欢经典基督教的一切，除了那个唯一性。但我无法忍受。他们说，这太排他了。

现在让我们快速地说几件事。首先，耶稣基督的唯一性，基督教的唯一性不是一种不容忍的态度。啊，人们说这是问题所在。如果只是，如果基督徒能摆脱那种不容忍，如果他们能摆脱那种排他的态度，那么我会更好地处理它。但你不明白吗？基督教的唯一性不是一种态度，不是心理上的东西。它是内在的，是圣诞节实际宣告的一部分。

### 结论：以马内利是良药

这样说，它与态度无关。如果你想摆脱基督教的唯一性，你不能只是要求基督徒放松他们的态度。你必须摧毁圣诞节，你必须永远把它拿走。

然后有一个非常富有的人，在他死之前，他埋藏了一笔难以置信的宝藏，他说它在怀俄明州、蒙大拿州或俄亥俄州的某个地方，然后他死了。当然，很多人想找到它，但这是绝望的。谁能在如此广阔的地方找到埋藏的宝藏？

然后突然，一小群人站出来，他们公开宣称他们找到了埋藏宝藏的人手中的藏宝图。地图告诉了它的确切位置。他们说，我们有地图。

现在，讨论会如何进行？一方面，有些人会说，他们有地图，因此他们知道通往宝藏的道路。另一方面，有人会说，他们没有地图。因此，他们没有通往宝藏的道路。但没有人会理性地说，你凭什么认为你有地图？因为你看，这不是一个容忍的问题。这是一个是否是地图的问题。

没有人会说，你凭什么？怎么敢有人认为他们知道通往宝藏的道路？这很荒谬。同样地，当耶稣说，我是道路、真理和生命，没有人能到父那里去，若不借着我。你不能说，耶稣，你为什么不放松一下？基督徒，你为什么不放松一下？你为什么不采取更宽容的态度？这不是一个容忍的问题。他是地图吗？

我们有唯一的宗教。任何宗教的创始人中唯一声称自己是神的人。他是地图吗？要么他是，他是道路，因为没有其他宗教的创始人声称是这样的人物，要么他不是地图，他不是道路，但怎么敢有人说，怎么敢你甚至认为你有权拥有地图？你不明白吗？

因此，唯一摆脱基督教唯一性的方法是摧毁圣诞节，因为这是它的基础。

你可能知道浪子回头的故事，但它不仅仅是关于一个迷途的弟弟。事实上，耶稣讲这个故事是为了对那些逃避神的人和那些试图通过做好事来赢得他的爱的人说话。在他的书《浪子神》中，Tim Keller 展示了这个著名的故事如何揭示福音的核心，一个为叛逆的弟弟和评判的哥哥带来希望的信息，并邀请所有人体验神的浪子般的、奢侈的恩典。

但在你试图摧毁圣诞节之前，也就是让第五大道上的所有零售商无论他们是否相信都对你感到非常生气。我建议你片刻，你错了，如果你认为基督教是一个排他性的宗教，并且圣诞节使它成为一个排他性的宗教。我的朋友们，圣诞节告诉我们基督教是一个彻底包容的宗教，这就是我的意思。

当你听到有人说，啊，是的，基督徒相信他们必须相信耶稣才能到达神那里。好吧，我相信所有好人，所有有价值的人，所有体面和道德和有爱心的人，无论他们信仰什么，都可以找到神。这听起来对你更包容吗？我告诉你，这实际上是一种非常非常狭隘的排他性。

这就是为什么一个说这话的人看起来比基督徒更包容，但实际上他们的前提是道德和善良足以找到神。这是他们的前提。他们的前提是，足够有爱心，足够有同情心。这足以找到神圣，这足以找到善良。他们说，任何真正美好和有爱心和有纪律和勤奋和有能力的人都可以找到神，那我们其他人呢？

你们这些排他类型的人说，任何人，无论他们信仰什么，任何好人都可以找到神。那我们这些没有纪律的人呢？那我们这些不无私的人呢？那我们这些生活在我们的记录中，当我们看它时，我们一点也不为之自豪的人呢？那我们这些神经质的人呢？

你不明白吗，你所谓的排他性，基本上所有宗教和所有哲学都在基督教之外说同样的话。他们说，这就是你应该如何过上一个美好和体面和道德的生活，任何过上美好和体面和道德生活的人都可以找到神圣。这是彻底的排他性，因为这意味着你的宗教只适合有能力的人，只适合有纪律的人，只适合好人。那我们这些失败者呢？

看，基督教是彻底包容的。这是唯一一个说无论你是谁，无论你做了什么，无论你的记录是什么。你可以与神联合。你可以被欢迎进入他的家庭，因为所有其他宗教都说我们有，这是要做的。让我们去找神。基督教说神来找我们，他以人的形式来到我们这里，你所要做的就是相信他，抓住他。

当施洗约翰对耶稣说，我们怎么知道你是要来的那一位？耶稣说，马太福音 11 章，他说，看，瞎子看见，瘸子行走，麻风病人得洁净，穷人有好消息给他们，麻风病人，穷人，被排斥的人，失败者，边缘人，那些其他宗教所谓的包容性宗教说所有好和有能力和有文化的人能够找到神。我有一个宗教，耶稣说，这是彻底包容的，把他们都带进来，因为我不是一个告诉你如何到达神的先知，我是神来到你这里，我是以马内利，我是神与你同在。

哥林多前书 1 章中也说了同样的事情。保罗对基督教会说，考虑你们的呼召，我的朋友们。他说，不多有智慧的，不多有权势的，不多有尊贵出身的，但神拣选了愚拙的事来羞辱智慧的，神拣选了软弱的事来羞辱强壮的，神拣选了卑贱的事，甚至那些不存在的事来废掉那些存在的事，以便没有人在他的面前夸口。

你不明白吗，基督教是彻底包容的，它不仅包括强者，还包括弱者，不仅包括智慧的，还包括愚拙的。没有圣诞节，基督教的其他一切都没有意义。耶稣是神，这就是为什么他的死如此有价值，否则他的死就没有那么重要。耶稣说神，这就是为什么他的主张有意义。耶稣说神，这就是为什么它确实使其他所有宗教过时。哦，你讨厌听到这个，因为它比他们更彻底包容。

耶稣说，无论你是谁，无论你做了什么，抓住我，安息在我身上，你所需要的只是需要，你所需要的只是没有。看，既令人反感又吸引人，他不仅是神，而且是与我们同在的神。

听着朋友们，当我结束时，让我指出这一点。这是一个药箱，圣诞节是一个药箱，其中有治愈你任何疾病的药。我希望你能看到这一点，我每年都试图突破你在参加圣诞礼拜时得到的感伤和怀旧的感觉。我想让你看到真正的东西。

让我给你几个快速的例子。今天你们中有些人有负罪感。像麦克白夫人一样，你走来走去，无法去掉那个该死的污点。有人告诉你，这只是自卑感，但如果你更坦诚，那就是内疚。你失败了，你没有达到标准，你正在努力偿还它，你永远不会理解你的生活，直到你开始从道德经济学的角度理解它。

你正在用你的眼泪偿还你的失败，或者你正在用你的善行偿还，或者你正在用你的成就或你的成就偿还，或者你正在通过自我毁灭的行为偿还，或者你正在通过拯救他人偿还，你正在偿还。

看看耶稣通过以马内利。是谁为你死在十字架上？神。不仅仅是任何人，不仅仅是一个好人，神。使徒行传 20 章 28 节说，神用自己的血赎了我们，神的血。这值多少钱？任何东西。所以停止偿还。停止像麦克白夫人所说的那样，用你的眼泪和努力去掉那个该死的污点，来找他，他是以马内利。他为你而死。神为你而死。他的一滴血可以偿还任何东西。你可以把它抛在脑后。你必须停在那里。

你不明白吗，以马内利是一种可以处理任何事情的药。但最重要的是，让我现在说我在礼拜开始时所说的，以马内利是关于神来与我们同在的。如果宇宙伟大的神会为了我们成为一个扭动的小婴儿，你应该愿意做什么来接近他？他为了接近我们付出了巨大的代价。接近他会让你付出一些代价，但绝不像他付出的那么多。

你将不得不放弃你的罪。你将不得不放弃你的生命。你可能不得不放弃更多的时间。但如果你有一个愿意走这么远来接近你的神，你不认为当你努力接近他时，他会回应吗？抓住，抓紧，爬行，做任何事情来接近这个神。或者现在有什么东西在你的生活中阻碍你接近他，摆脱它。他是与我们同在的神，以马内利。来找他，让我们祷告。

父啊，我们现在请求你赐给我们看到这个伟大真理的令人反感的吸引力。我们祈求你帮助我们在我们的生活中使用它，并在我们的心中使用它，以便我们看到其中的激进恩典。我们也祈求你帮助我们看到这是可以治愈我们任何事情的东西，无论我们做了什么，无论我们在哪里，无论我们多么远，我们都可以接近，因为你的儿子来到我们这里。我们祈求你通过你的圣灵帮助我们现在将这些伟大的真理应用到我们的心和生活中。我们奉耶稣的名祈求，阿门。
