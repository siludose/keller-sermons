## English Transcript / 英文原文

today as Tim Keller explores one of the fruit of the Spirit. The Scripture this morning is from Paul's letter to the Philippians chapter 4 verses 4 through 12. Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again. Rejoice.

Let the gentleness of your be evident to all. The Lord is near, do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petition with  thanksgiving present your requests to God. And the peace of God which transcends all understanding will  guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Finally, brothers, whatever is true  whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable. If anything is excellent or praiseworthy, think about such things.

Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me or seen in me, put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you. I rejoice greatly in the Lord that at last you have  renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you have been concerned but you had no opportunity to show it. I am not saying this because I am in need.

For I have learned to be content, whatever the  circumstances. I know what it is to be in need and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation whether well fed or hungry,  whether living in plenty or in want. This is the word of the Lord. The premise of the Bible is that there is a difference between a morally restrained heart  and a supernaturally changed heart.

There is a difference between controlling, suppressing  the natural self-centeredness and insecurity of the heart through willpower  and seeing it permanently changed through the power of the Holy Spirit. In the book of Galatians, chapter 5, there is a list of the traits,  characteristics of a supernaturally changed heart. They are called the fruit of the Spirit. Love, joy, peace, patience. It is a classic list.

And each week we are taking one of those  traits and taking a passage, the scripture that describes it and trying to come to understand  how we can have more of that supernaturally changed heart in our own lives. Today,  we look at peace. Peace. And we are going to learn three things from this classic passage. The character of peace, the disciplines, the three disciplines of getting peace, and the secret.

Paul uses that word, the secret of peace. The character of peace, the disciplines of peace,  and the secret of peace. Now, the opposite of joy is sadness or despair, grief. But the opposite of peace is anxiety, fear, and debilitating worry. So you see here in verse 6,  it says, don't be anxious about anything, and the antidote is the peace of God.

By the way,  this word anxious is not the normal, it's not normal care and concern. If you love somebody,  if you love something, if you love anything, you have the burden of love and concern that comes  with that automatically. But this is a word that actually means to be torn up, to be torn into pieces  by debilitating worry and fear. So what is this piece of God? Two things, just to start.

Two things that Paul tells us about it. First, it's an inner calm and equilibrium. Because here down at the bottom, in verse 11 and 12, he says, I've learned how to be content  in whatever circumstance. I've learned the secret of being content in every situation,  which is to say, I'm the same in one situation as the other. That's poise, equilibrium,  an inner calm.

And for a second, let's think about his circumstances. See you and I, here in New York, we spend money in order to get poise. He's spent money on pills,  he's spent money on therapy, he's spent money on, and these things, you know, are things that  might maybe we need. But we're trying to get up the poise, the equipoise to face what,  you know, our bills, competition, the boss, our date, our lack of dates. One of the, what you're  doing is, these are the things that we're, that we're nervous about and we're anxious about  and we're really working at it.

And Paul is facing torture and death. He's in prison. And he's  saying, I've learned the secret of being able to smile at that. And look carefully, does Paul say,  you know why I can smile on the face of torture and death because I'm just that kind of guy. I'm a tough cookie.

No. See that's, that's talent. See talent is something that you were born with. There you've got it. I'm just one of those guys.

He doesn't say that. I've learned this. He said,  I've learned it. What does that mean? It's not natural to me, in fact.

It's not natural to you either. I've learned it. This calm so that I've got this equilibrium in any situation. But that's not  the only thing. The second thing Paul tells us about the character of this piece.

It's not just  an absence of fear. It's the presence of something. In particular, it's a sense of being protected. Because that doesn't come out as well in English as it should. It says in verse seven,  the peace of God will guard your hearts and your minds.

The word guard is a military word. It's a very  vivid word. It means to take a bunch of soldiers to take an army and surround a city with the army  to protect it from invasion. So if you have an army out there, you sleep really well. You know,  there's a whole army out there.

I don't have to worry about marauders or anybody. You know,  I go to sleep at night. And this is getting at something very important. And we'll see this in a  minute. Both in the ancient times and in modern times.

When people try to give advice on how to  become. They almost always talk about removing certain thoughts. Don't think about that. Don't think  that. Don't think those negative thoughts.

Stop thinking about that. Stop thinking about that. Control your thoughts. You know, expel the negative thoughts. That's how you get calm.

But here we see the peace of God is not the absence of some thoughts. It's the presence  of God himself. The God of peace will be with you. Christian peace is not  expelling negative thoughts. The problem with expelling negative thoughts is what you're really  doing there is you're just refusing to face how bad things are.

You know, you're not being  realistic. Okay, I'm going to get calm by not facing the facts. Essentially, Christian peace  is not that you stop facing the facts, but you get something in your life, a living power that  comes into your life that enables you to triumph over those facts, lifts you up over and through them. And it's a sense of being protected. And, you know, I, you, lots of us have experienced, I think,  lots of believers have experienced this peace of God.

But in the situations that I have been present  as a pastor usually, where I've seen people experience this peace of God that passes, that transcends  understanding, that goes beyond anything we can really account for. I've seen some people in  horrible situations, tragic situations, in some cases, having faced some violent death of a loved  one. Unlooked for. That's just the worst kind of situation to be in. And ordinarily, when you're  cruising along in life and suddenly somebody who you love is just ripped out of your life, violent.

At that time, you feel unprotected. You feel vulnerable. You feel like exposed. You feel like  you feel ravaged. And yet, sometimes I've seen Christians experience exactly the opposite.

They feel, during times like that, protected, like everything. Somehow, they have a sense that  God is with them and everything is going to be okay. They feel protected. They know exactly how bad  things are, but they've got something that enables them to triumph over it. If you've ever been on a  coast and seen in a storm and seen the waves come in and hit the rocks, sometimes the waves are  so huge that it covers some rock you might be watching.

And you say, that's the end of that rock. No way that rock's going to be there. And when the waves receive, it's received there it is. Hasn't budged an inch. And Paul is like that.

If you read his life, wave after wave,  he's beaten, he's stoned, he's flawed, he's shipwrecked. They're after him. They're trying to kill  him. He's betrayed. Wave after wave after wave.

And it's a plain historical fact. He's right. When he  said, I have found a way to be completely poised under any circumstances. He's the rock. All the waves  of life could not break him.

And he says, this isn't a natural talent. You can learn this. So that's the character of Christian peace. It's an inner calm and an equal living that comes from  that, but also a sense of God's presence and almost a reason transcending sense of his protection. Number one, number two, what then are the disciplines by which you can develop this piece?

Because actually, Paul's giving lots of advice in here, lots of advice on how you can develop this  piece and have this piece of God too. And there's three disciplines. And I'll name them  thinking, thanking and loving. I know the third one should be a TH, but I couldn't figure it out. Thinking, thanking and loving.

Thinking. Notice verse eight. He says,  brethren, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure. Think on these  things and the God of peace will be with you. So the first thing is thinking.

And this is really  important. Really important. Let's take a look at the first three of this long list. Think about  whatever is true, noble, right. Now that sounds pretty general, generic, doesn't it?

Whatever is  true, noble, right? But when Paul, this is Paul. And when Paul uses these words, these particular  Greek words in the Pauline corpus and his writings, he's talking about doctrine. He's talking about  the teaching of the Bible about God, about sin, and about Christ, and about salvation, and about  the world and human nature and God's plans for the world and the plan of salvation. That's what he's  talking about.

And this is amazing. He's saying, if you want peace, think about doctrine. Think  about what you know, about life and about God and about, and this is so completely different  than what you're going to find if you walk into a Barnes and Noble Reborder's bookstore and you go  to the place on anxiety, worry, stress, dealing with stress, how to relax. And you get out of book,  and here's what the woman never do. Never.

None of these books will ever say, so you're stressed,  your own hat, anxious. Let's start by asking the big questions. What is the meaning of life? What are you really here for? What's your life all about?

Where have you come from and where are  you going? I mean, what should human beings spend their time doing? Never. You think that's  going to relieve stress to a modern New Yorker? Of course not.

Why? Here's why they go right to  technique. They never ask you to think. They never say, let's think about the big questions,  you know, what's they fall about? Let's put things in perspective.

Never. They go to techniques. They go to relaxation techniques. They go to work, rest balance. For example, they'll say,  look, a couple times, every quarter, go somewhere, sit on a beach, look at the surf, and just  bracket out and stop worrying about thinking about everything else.

Just, or they'll give you  thought control techniques about dealing with negative thoughts, the negative emotions,  guilt thoughts, and so forth. They will never tell you to think. They'll tell you to actually  they go right to technique. Here's why. Let me read you two.

You don't want to worry, I'm going  for a second, but let me read you two interesting quotes. Here's Charles Darwin. And Charles Darwin  said quote, a person who has no assured belief in the existence of a personal God  and no belief in a future existence with retribution or reward. Such a person can have for his  rule of life as far as I see, only to follow whatever impulses and instincts are the strongest  or whatever seems to him to be the best ones. Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.

You know, great Supreme Court justice. Quite a formidable intellectual in the early 20th century. And one of his personal correspondents, he once wrote this to a friend. He says, there is no reason  for attributing to a man a significance different in kind from that which belongs to a baboon  or a grain of sand. The world has produced me and the reddle snake, but I will kill it if I get  the chance.

And the only reason is because it is incongruous to the world I want. The world  everyone is trying to make according to one's own power. Now, by the way, Oliver Wendell Holmes  got a lot of heat for this. He's a Supreme Court justice. And he says, you know, there is no rational  reason to say that human being is really more valuable, more significant than an animal or a rock.

Oh my gosh, people have gone, but you know what, his biographers have said, you know, he's just  working out the implications. If you don't believe in God, this is what Darwin is saying. I think you don't believe in God. And you believe you're here by accident. And when you die, you rot,  that's it.

And when the sun dies, everything goes away. And therefore, nothing that human beings have  ever tried to accomplish will mount anything. Okay, what are the implications of that? One of them  is there is no right and wrong. You may feel there's right and wrong.

Darwin says, you may have a  feeling, but your feeling shouldn't trump anybody else's. You can feel it, but there is no right and wrong. There's really no way to tell people how they ought to live. Holmes is right. Ultimately, what a  human being is is just we've we're the product of these forces and we're going to go away someday  and what's to say that, you know, it may feel more significant than an animal or a rock, but you're  not.

And what the biographers said was Holmes was simply thinking out the implications of not  believing there's a God or there's a purpose in life. Well, I know plenty of New Yorkers that have  the same beliefs. Lots of the same people have the same beliefs. That is, they have the same beliefs. They don't think there's a God.

They think things are here by accident. But they would say to think  about it like that to work out the implications is morbid. Okay, look, fine. That's fine to say,  let's not think out the implications is morbid, but I want you to see what you're doing. You're getting your peace by not thinking out the implications of your beliefs,  whereas Paul is saying Christian peace is exactly the opposite.

Christian peace comes from  thinking out the implications, thinking. See, what are the true and the right? What's the Christian  doctrine? God, there's a God and He made us for fellowship with Him and He created a perfect world,  you know, a perfect world in which there's no sorrow or disease or death originally. And He wanted  to live with us in it and of course it's gone all wrong and we've turned from Him and the world  is broken but He's sent His Son into the world to rescue us and He's preparing a new heavens and  new earth.

We're going to live with Him forever. Look at your value, look at the fact that the future  is secure now. What does that mean? If you're a Christian today and you believe all that doctrine  and you're not at peace, you're not thinking. Isn't that something?

You're not thinking. See, there's a stupid piece and then there's a smart piece. Let me tell you the stupid piece. Stupid pieces. Ho, ho, ho, to the bottle I go, to heal my heart and drown my woe.

Now what's that? A couple, I'm going to pop a cork. I'm going to sit under a tree. I'm going to look at the  surface. I'm not going to think I'm going to bracket out.

See, if I think about all the things that  are going wrong in life and in the world, I'm just going to bracket it. I'm not going to think  as much. But the Paul is saying, if you're a Christian, you don't bracket out. You bracket in. You think big, big picture.

Everything's going to be okay. You know, if you really believe just the  basic Christian truth and you think it and think it and think about it, you're going to get peace. And if you don't have peace, you're not thinking. There's stupid piece and there's smart piece  and Christian's piece is not by making yourself stupid. It's by making yourself as aware of your  beliefs as thoughtful as possible.

That's only number one. Because if you first learn the  discipline of thinking, then secondly, there's the discipline of thinking. Because see how very  important that is in verse six. Paul says, don't be anxious. Okay, don't be anxious.

Fine. Well,  then what should we be doing? But make requests to God with thanksgiving. So thanksgiving is put  against anxiety. But look carefully here.

It's a little counterintuitive, isn't it? See, what we  would say is you make your request to God and then you get your request and if you get your requests,  you think. I don't know what it says. It says you thank him as you make the request. Well, why should I thank him?

As I'm making the request, John, I want to wait until I see what he's  going to do. No. Paul says you're never going to be content unless you make your request. That  means you acknowledge that life is in his hands and you thank him for whatever he's going to do. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God.

Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to  face every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365 day devotional, the songs of Jesus,  you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a  regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start. And if you already spend time  in study and prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest  emotions and questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with him. We'll send you  Tim and Kathy Keller's devotional is our thanks for your gift to help Gospel and Life share the  love of Jesus with more people.

That's why I put it thinking, then thanking. But now listen,  we already talked about this. God did not make the world to be a world filled with sorrow and death  and violence and suffering. But he's got a plan. He's got a plan to renew it.

He's got a plan to  get it back. And the plan is put in the abstract in Romans 8, 28, where it says,  if you love God, God is working everything together for good in your life. Absolutely,  everything, even the bad things, even the things that he hates, the things that he didn't put  into this world. He is going to weave into a plan, a tapestry. He's going to put everything  together and he's going to weave it all together for your good and his glory.

That's an abstraction. Here's the concrete. On the day that Jesus Christ was crucified, all of his friends  would have looked up and said, I can't believe this. The good he was doing, the people he was healing,  the people's lies he was changing. I can't believe this happened.

I can't believe  that these charges were trumped up. I can't believe they're doing this. And you would have said,  I can't believe the God could bring anything good out of this. You would have gone home,  senders. Absolutely no way.

God could bring anything good out of this. And you were looking  straight at the greatest thing God has ever done toward the redemption of the world. But you  couldn't get it into your little brain at the moment as to how that could possibly be. And God  is saying that is just the prime example of what I'm doing in everybody's life. Even the terrible  things that are happening to you, I'm working out for good.

I'm only saying this because I'm like  a little rat and when I push down a bar and I get food, I push it again. So I'll tell you this story  again because you always like it. The most vivid example of this for me was when in my early 20s  I prayed for a year, oh, there's a girl that I wanted to date and she was breaking up with me. I was a girl. I was thinking of marrying and she wanted to break up with me.

I was all week,  all year. I said, Lord, don't let her break up with me. Of course, it was the wrong girl. Wasn't the one sitting out here looking at me with a grin on her face right now. But I actually helped God.

I mean, I actually did what I could to help God with the prayer  because she was that one summer near the very end of the relationship. She was working at a  a poke, you know, a resort for the summer in a poke, and I got a job as a short order cook at  the same resort. I was saying, Lord, I'm making this as easy as possible for you. You know,  I've asked for this prayer and I'm just, you know, I'm taking the distance down everything. But I look back at it.

God was saying, my son, when a child of mine makes a request. I always give that person what he or she would have asked for if they knew everything I know. Do you believe that? To the degree you believe that, you're going to have peace. And if you don't believe it, you don't have peace.

And whose fault is that? Is it God's? See, make your request known with Thanksgiving. So there's thinking,  that's the first discipline. And if you do that, then thinking is the second discipline,  but loving, loving is the last one.

And where do we get that? Well,  notice Paul doesn't just say, think on what is true, what is noble, what is right. And by the way,  you know what it says, think about such things? That is, the Greek word there means to drill down. It means to ponder.

It means to not over chew, over meditate. It doesn't just mean think about. It just means, it just means, you know, just continually pound these things into your head. But see, the first three have more to do with the mind. Whatever is true, whatever is noble,  whatever is right.

But then look, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable, whatever is excellent. This is attraction. This is love. He says, not enough just to think on the right things. It's also  important to love the right thing.

And here we have to go to St. Augustine. St. Augustine,  great Christian thinker, lived in the third and fourth century. He was completely aware,  profoundly aware of the problem in Greek philosophy.

And it had been for years. In fact,  Paul's referring to it. The great problem is, how can you live a life of contentment? And the Greek word for that was adorakia. And that's the very word Paul uses twice in 11 and 12.

He says, I've learned. I've got the adorakia. It means to be independent of circumstances. It means to have this poise. It means to have this power.

And not to be upset, devastated,  you know, melted down, freaking out over anything. Always poised. And of course, as you might guess,  the philosophers that really worked that out were the Stoics. And what the Stoics taught was,  the reason why most people are not able to live, contented, you know, lies of equilibrium,  is that they love the wrong things. You should never love success.

If you set your heart on success,  even if you get successful, you'll always be anxious. You'll never have peace because you'll be  afraid of losing it. And of course, if you don't get it, you'll even be worse. And you shouldn't  set your heart primarily on family. Because even if you get a good family, you'll always be worried  about it.

You'll always be anxious, you see, for something to go wrong with the family. And if  the something goes wrong with the family, you know, you'll be devastated. So the philosophers were  saying, here's the problem. You're loving things that you're not in control of. And therefore,  they said, don't you dare give your heart to anything but your own virtue.

That's what the  philosopher said. That's what's certain with the Stoics said. Most of them. Because the virtue is  something you can control. You can't control success.

It has so much to do with circumstances. You can't control your family. Things can go wrong with your family. You can't control this,  you can't control that. So don't set your heart on anything you can't control.

That's what they  said. And then you will know tranquility. Set your heart only on your own virtue. You can be courageous,  you can be have integrity, you can be honest. Set your heart only on the only thing that should  really truly make you content is to know that you are being the person you want to be.

That's  under your control. Nothing else is. And Saint Augustine said, you guys have completely missed the  boat. If you think that your virtue is under your control, it is not. Listen, if you say,  the thing I'm going to live for is success.

And you've set off, yeah, it's not certain you're going  to have success. But if you say the thing that matters to me is that I be the person I want to be,  to live according to my principles, you know, living according to my virtues. He says,  that's every bit is uncertain. You don't have control over that. You're human being.

You're frail. And if you fail, then you've got nothing. Augustine says, you got it wrong. You shouldn't be loving  things out there and you shouldn't be loving anything in here. And then he said, only love of the  immutable can bring tranquility.

Only love of the immutable. What's the immutable? That which cannot  change. Your virtue can change. Don't give me this stuff about control.

He says, your problem is  that our problem, the reason we don't have pieces, we're loving mutable things, things that  circumstances, including our virtue can take away from us. But there's one thing that's immutable  that not only can circumstances not take it away from you, but even the worst circumstances in  this life only give you more of it. Have you thought about that? What's the worst circumstances? Violent death.

And there's one thing that if you love it supremely, even violent death gives you  more of it. What is it? The presence of God, the beauty of God, the face of God. And that's the  reason why Augustine could say this and it was just amazing. In his confessions, he lays it out.

First of all, he says this. In confessions, this is book four. He says, God alone is the place  of peace that cannot be disturbed. And God will not withhold Himself from your love unless you  withhold your love from Him. See, there it is.

If you love the immutable, you'll have tranquility. So how can you not love the immutable only if you withhold your love from Him? But if you don't withhold your love from Him, you will not withhold His love from you. And you might say, and at some point, Augustine being a great writer was hearing an objection. And the objection goes like this.

The objection says, well, no, wait a minute. You're saying I have to love God, but I love a lot of things. I love material comforts. I love  people. I love romance.

I love, you know, there's lots of things. I have to love God not these things. And he says, no, no, no. But you have to say that if you love God supremely, you not only get God  the immutable, but you will find that all that what you have been loving in these things  was actually in God. He puts it like this.

He's praying. Augustine writes, quote, what do I love  when I love thee? Not the beauty of bodies, nor the fair harmony of time, nor the brightness of the  light, so glads into our eyes, nor sweet melodies of varied songs, nor the fragrance, smell of flowers. Not limbs acceptable to the embracements of the flesh. None of these things I love when I love my God.

But and yet I love a kind of light melody, fragrance, meet an embracement when I love my God. But they are those which space cannot contain, which time cannot bear away. They are smells that  breathing cannot disperse. They are taste that eating cannot diminish. This is what I love when I  love my God.

And that's the final way to get the calm, to get the tranquility, to get the peace. It's to love him supremely. Now, finally, I told you character of peace, the three disciplines of  peace, but the secret, Paul talks about the secret. And this is why we're not done yet. And here's why  we're not done yet.

Try to go home and love the immutable. Just go ahead. And then tell me,  you know, write a paper and tell me how it went. I mean, just go home and sit down, find a nice quiet  place, sit down, and then try. Go.

Just try to love the immutable. And then I'm not feeling  anything yet. See, God is just a term. God is just, he's an abstraction, frankly. The word God is  just an abstraction.

But notice what it says, the secret of the peace of heart of God, or maybe I should  say the peace of God keeps your hearts and your minds, not just in God, but in Christ Jesus. And by the way, hearts and minds have separated there grammatically because Paul's trying to say,  it's one thing to keep your thoughts in Christ Jesus. We already talked about this. It's another  thing to put your heart in him, to have your heart in Christ Jesus. How does it work?

To find  him attractive, to find him lovely, to find him unbelievably lovely. See, it's not enough. It  says, Paul says, I want you to find Jesus Christ lovely. That's the only way you're ever going to  love the immutable and find that trend of quality. Well, how do you do that?

Think like this. There's  a place, actually, we read this. It was in a passage we looked at earlier this year, but we didn't  look at the verse. It's in Isaiah 57. Remember, when we're going through Isaiah?

Isaiah 57,  near the, at the end of the chapter says this, the wicked are like the tossing sea,  which cannot rest whose waves cast up myron mud. There is no peace, says my God, for the wicked. The wicked are like the tossing sea, which cannot rest whose waves cast up myron mud. There is no peace, says my God, for the wicked. Now, at first sight, this just looks like another one  of these Old Testament statements, God will smite the evil doers, but no, look, this is talking about  natural consequences.

And the stomachs had it right, and Augustin had it right. If you love anything  more than God, I don't just mean it's important to believe in God, of course, you have to believe in  God, but if you love anything more than God, if you live for anything more than God, your life  is going to be like a tossing sea, restless, constantly casting up myron mud,  because your life is like a house built on sand instead of on the rock, and you're always  going to be having cave-ins. We've been through it. If you love anything, you're going to  always be an anxiety about it. Anything more than God.

And so God is saying the natural consequence  of turning away from me, the natural consequence of not building your whole life,  centering your whole life on me, is restlessness, deep restlessness. Who took those consequences? You know, in 2 Corinthians 521, we always, that I always  quote, God made Jesus sin, who knew no sin, that we might become the righteous of God and him,  and how I always try to point out that doesn't mean that God made Jesus sinful. It means on the  cross he treated him as the sinners deserve. And what does this mean?

On the cross, he got all the  consequences of what we have done. And this is one of them. And can't you see it? Do you see Jesus Christ just walking through the crucifixion saying, I'm just keeping my mind  centered on God? I'm okay.

I'm content in whatever circumstance I'm in. Jesus didn't say that. No,  because he wasn't. Why? Because he lost all of his peace.

He cries, my God, my God,  why hast thou forsaken me? In fact, we're told that he died with a cry. He died screaming. Bill Lane, the commentator on the book of Mark, says, he says, the cry of dereliction. That  screaming says crucified criminals ordinarily suffered complete exhaustion.

And for long periods were  unconscious before they died. The stark realism of Mark's account describes a sudden violent death. The cry of dereliction expresses unfathomable pain. Jesus lost all of his peace. All of his peace.

So you could have eternal peace. And looking at that is what we'll get you  through. That's what we'll make him lovely. And let me prove it to you. We've got a case right  in front of you.

Horatio Spafford was an American lawyer who lost everything he had in the Chicago  Fire of 1871. Only two years later, he sent his wife Anna and their four daughters on a ship  across the Atlantic Ocean to England for a trip. The ship hit another ship on the way and began to  sink. As was sinking, Anna got the four little girls together and they prayed. And then the ship  went under the water and they all were scattered into the waves.

And all four good little girls  drowned. Anna was found unconscious by a rescue ship floating. They rescued her. They took her to England  and she cabled Horatio Spafford just two words, saved alone. And when Horatio Spafford was on the ship  over to England to bring his wife home, he began to write a hymn that we're going to sing at the end.

Is well with my soul, peace like a river. He wrote that. And here's what I want you to think. Why would a  man dealing with his grief, seeking the peace of God, the peace like a river, spent the entire  thing on Jesus? My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought, my sin, not in part, but the whole,  is nailed to the cross.

And I bear it no more. Praise the Lord, praise the Lord on my soul. What is  that got to do with his four little girls that are dead? Everything. You know why?

Look, when things  go wrong, one of the ways you lose your peace as you say, maybe I'm being punished, but no,  look at the cross. All the punishment fell on him. Another thing you say is, well, maybe God  doesn't care, maybe doesn't care. And no, look what he did for us. Look what he bore for us.

The Bible gives you a God that says, I've lost the child too, but not involuntarily, voluntarily for  your sake. You sing that hymn and you watch a man thinking, thanking and loving himself into  the peace of God. It worked for him under those circumstances. It worked for Paul under his  circumstances. It worked for you.

Let's pray. Thank you, Father, for giving us this offer, peace,  like a river, peace and fallible. We see, Lord, that peace is not something that really does just come  it's not a talent and it's really not even just a simple gift. It's a discipline. We have a number  of beliefs that we're not thinking into.

We have a wonderful God that we're not loving  and therefore we don't have the peace we ought to have. Give us this peace because we know the secret  how we can be thankful for even the bad things in our lives. It's the cross. How we can know that  God is with us no matter what it's the cross and we pray that you would help us knowing the gospel  of Jesus Christ. Think and thank and love you into the peace of God.

It's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today as Tim Keller explores one of the fruit of the Spirit. The Scripture this morning is from Paul's letter to the Philippians chapter 4 verses 4 through 12. Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again. Rejoice.

Let the gentleness of your be evident to all. The Lord is near, do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petition with  thanksgiving present your requests to God. And the peace of God which transcends all understanding will  guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Finally, brothers, whatever is true  whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable. If anything is excellent or praiseworthy, think about such things.

Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me or seen in me, put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you. I rejoice greatly in the Lord that at last you have  renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you have been concerned but you had no opportunity to show it. I am not saying this because I am in need.

For I have learned to be content, whatever the  circumstances. I know what it is to be in need and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation whether well fed or hungry,  whether living in plenty or in want. This is the word of the Lord. The premise of the Bible is that there is a difference between a morally restrained heart  and a supernaturally changed heart.

There is a difference between controlling, suppressing  the natural self-centeredness and insecurity of the heart through willpower  and seeing it permanently changed through the power of the Holy Spirit. In the book of Galatians, chapter 5, there is a list of the traits,  characteristics of a supernaturally changed heart. They are called the fruit of the Spirit. Love, joy, peace, patience. It is a classic list.

And each week we are taking one of those  traits and taking a passage, the scripture that describes it and trying to come to understand  how we can have more of that supernaturally changed heart in our own lives. Today,  we look at peace. Peace. And we are going to learn three things from this classic passage. The character of peace, the disciplines, the three disciplines of getting peace, and the secret.

Paul uses that word, the secret of peace. The character of peace, the disciplines of peace,  and the secret of peace. Now, the opposite of joy is sadness or despair, grief. But the opposite of peace is anxiety, fear, and debilitating worry. So you see here in verse 6,  it says, don't be anxious about anything, and the antidote is the peace of God.

By the way,  this word anxious is not the normal, it's not normal care and concern. If you love somebody,  if you love something, if you love anything, you have the burden of love and concern that comes  with that automatically. But this is a word that actually means to be torn up, to be torn into pieces  by debilitating worry and fear. So what is this piece of God? Two things, just to start.

Two things that Paul tells us about it. First, it's an inner calm and equilibrium. Because here down at the bottom, in verse 11 and 12, he says, I've learned how to be content  in whatever circumstance. I've learned the secret of being content in every situation,  which is to say, I'm the same in one situation as the other. That's poise, equilibrium,  an inner calm.

And for a second, let's think about his circumstances. See you and I, here in New York, we spend money in order to get poise. He's spent money on pills,  he's spent money on therapy, he's spent money on, and these things, you know, are things that  might maybe we need. But we're trying to get up the poise, the equipoise to face what,  you know, our bills, competition, the boss, our date, our lack of dates. One of the, what you're  doing is, these are the things that we're, that we're nervous about and we're anxious about  and we're really working at it.

And Paul is facing torture and death. He's in prison. And he's  saying, I've learned the secret of being able to smile at that. And look carefully, does Paul say,  you know why I can smile on the face of torture and death because I'm just that kind of guy. I'm a tough cookie.

No. See that's, that's talent. See talent is something that you were born with. There you've got it. I'm just one of those guys.

He doesn't say that. I've learned this. He said,  I've learned it. What does that mean? It's not natural to me, in fact.

It's not natural to you either. I've learned it. This calm so that I've got this equilibrium in any situation. But that's not  the only thing. The second thing Paul tells us about the character of this piece.

It's not just  an absence of fear. It's the presence of something. In particular, it's a sense of being protected. Because that doesn't come out as well in English as it should. It says in verse seven,  the peace of God will guard your hearts and your minds.

The word guard is a military word. It's a very  vivid word. It means to take a bunch of soldiers to take an army and surround a city with the army  to protect it from invasion. So if you have an army out there, you sleep really well. You know,  there's a whole army out there.

I don't have to worry about marauders or anybody. You know,  I go to sleep at night. And this is getting at something very important. And we'll see this in a  minute. Both in the ancient times and in modern times.

When people try to give advice on how to  become. They almost always talk about removing certain thoughts. Don't think about that. Don't think  that. Don't think those negative thoughts.

Stop thinking about that. Stop thinking about that. Control your thoughts. You know, expel the negative thoughts. That's how you get calm.

But here we see the peace of God is not the absence of some thoughts. It's the presence  of God himself. The God of peace will be with you. Christian peace is not  expelling negative thoughts. The problem with expelling negative thoughts is what you're really  doing there is you're just refusing to face how bad things are.

You know, you're not being  realistic. Okay, I'm going to get calm by not facing the facts. Essentially, Christian peace  is not that you stop facing the facts, but you get something in your life, a living power that  comes into your life that enables you to triumph over those facts, lifts you up over and through them. And it's a sense of being protected. And, you know, I, you, lots of us have experienced, I think,  lots of believers have experienced this peace of God.

But in the situations that I have been present  as a pastor usually, where I've seen people experience this peace of God that passes, that transcends  understanding, that goes beyond anything we can really account for. I've seen some people in  horrible situations, tragic situations, in some cases, having faced some violent death of a loved  one. Unlooked for. That's just the worst kind of situation to be in. And ordinarily, when you're  cruising along in life and suddenly somebody who you love is just ripped out of your life, violent.

At that time, you feel unprotected. You feel vulnerable. You feel like exposed. You feel like  you feel ravaged. And yet, sometimes I've seen Christians experience exactly the opposite.

They feel, during times like that, protected, like everything. Somehow, they have a sense that  God is with them and everything is going to be okay. They feel protected. They know exactly how bad  things are, but they've got something that enables them to triumph over it. If you've ever been on a  coast and seen in a storm and seen the waves come in and hit the rocks, sometimes the waves are  so huge that it covers some rock you might be watching.

And you say, that's the end of that rock. No way that rock's going to be there. And when the waves receive, it's received there it is. Hasn't budged an inch. And Paul is like that.

If you read his life, wave after wave,  he's beaten, he's stoned, he's flawed, he's shipwrecked. They're after him. They're trying to kill  him. He's betrayed. Wave after wave after wave.

And it's a plain historical fact. He's right. When he  said, I have found a way to be completely poised under any circumstances. He's the rock. All the waves  of life could not break him.

And he says, this isn't a natural talent. You can learn this. So that's the character of Christian peace. It's an inner calm and an equal living that comes from  that, but also a sense of God's presence and almost a reason transcending sense of his protection. Number one, number two, what then are the disciplines by which you can develop this piece?

Because actually, Paul's giving lots of advice in here, lots of advice on how you can develop this  piece and have this piece of God too. And there's three disciplines. And I'll name them  thinking, thanking and loving. I know the third one should be a TH, but I couldn't figure it out. Thinking, thanking and loving.

Thinking. Notice verse eight. He says,  brethren, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure. Think on these  things and the God of peace will be with you. So the first thing is thinking.

And this is really  important. Really important. Let's take a look at the first three of this long list. Think about  whatever is true, noble, right. Now that sounds pretty general, generic, doesn't it?

Whatever is  true, noble, right? But when Paul, this is Paul. And when Paul uses these words, these particular  Greek words in the Pauline corpus and his writings, he's talking about doctrine. He's talking about  the teaching of the Bible about God, about sin, and about Christ, and about salvation, and about  the world and human nature and God's plans for the world and the plan of salvation. That's what he's  talking about.

And this is amazing. He's saying, if you want peace, think about doctrine. Think  about what you know, about life and about God and about, and this is so completely different  than what you're going to find if you walk into a Barnes and Noble Reborder's bookstore and you go  to the place on anxiety, worry, stress, dealing with stress, how to relax. And you get out of book,  and here's what the woman never do. Never.

None of these books will ever say, so you're stressed,  your own hat, anxious. Let's start by asking the big questions. What is the meaning of life? What are you really here for? What's your life all about?

Where have you come from and where are  you going? I mean, what should human beings spend their time doing? Never. You think that's  going to relieve stress to a modern New Yorker? Of course not.

Why? Here's why they go right to  technique. They never ask you to think. They never say, let's think about the big questions,  you know, what's they fall about? Let's put things in perspective.

Never. They go to techniques. They go to relaxation techniques. They go to work, rest balance. For example, they'll say,  look, a couple times, every quarter, go somewhere, sit on a beach, look at the surf, and just  bracket out and stop worrying about thinking about everything else.

Just, or they'll give you  thought control techniques about dealing with negative thoughts, the negative emotions,  guilt thoughts, and so forth. They will never tell you to think. They'll tell you to actually  they go right to technique. Here's why. Let me read you two.

You don't want to worry, I'm going  for a second, but let me read you two interesting quotes. Here's Charles Darwin. And Charles Darwin  said quote, a person who has no assured belief in the existence of a personal God  and no belief in a future existence with retribution or reward. Such a person can have for his  rule of life as far as I see, only to follow whatever impulses and instincts are the strongest  or whatever seems to him to be the best ones. Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.

You know, great Supreme Court justice. Quite a formidable intellectual in the early 20th century. And one of his personal correspondents, he once wrote this to a friend. He says, there is no reason  for attributing to a man a significance different in kind from that which belongs to a baboon  or a grain of sand. The world has produced me and the reddle snake, but I will kill it if I get  the chance.

And the only reason is because it is incongruous to the world I want. The world  everyone is trying to make according to one's own power. Now, by the way, Oliver Wendell Holmes  got a lot of heat for this. He's a Supreme Court justice. And he says, you know, there is no rational  reason to say that human being is really more valuable, more significant than an animal or a rock.

Oh my gosh, people have gone, but you know what, his biographers have said, you know, he's just  working out the implications. If you don't believe in God, this is what Darwin is saying. I think you don't believe in God. And you believe you're here by accident. And when you die, you rot,  that's it.

And when the sun dies, everything goes away. And therefore, nothing that human beings have  ever tried to accomplish will mount anything. Okay, what are the implications of that? One of them  is there is no right and wrong. You may feel there's right and wrong.

Darwin says, you may have a  feeling, but your feeling shouldn't trump anybody else's. You can feel it, but there is no right and wrong. There's really no way to tell people how they ought to live. Holmes is right. Ultimately, what a  human being is is just we've we're the product of these forces and we're going to go away someday  and what's to say that, you know, it may feel more significant than an animal or a rock, but you're  not.

And what the biographers said was Holmes was simply thinking out the implications of not  believing there's a God or there's a purpose in life. Well, I know plenty of New Yorkers that have  the same beliefs. Lots of the same people have the same beliefs. That is, they have the same beliefs. They don't think there's a God.

They think things are here by accident. But they would say to think  about it like that to work out the implications is morbid. Okay, look, fine. That's fine to say,  let's not think out the implications is morbid, but I want you to see what you're doing. You're getting your peace by not thinking out the implications of your beliefs,  whereas Paul is saying Christian peace is exactly the opposite.

Christian peace comes from  thinking out the implications, thinking. See, what are the true and the right? What's the Christian  doctrine? God, there's a God and He made us for fellowship with Him and He created a perfect world,  you know, a perfect world in which there's no sorrow or disease or death originally. And He wanted  to live with us in it and of course it's gone all wrong and we've turned from Him and the world  is broken but He's sent His Son into the world to rescue us and He's preparing a new heavens and  new earth.

We're going to live with Him forever. Look at your value, look at the fact that the future  is secure now. What does that mean? If you're a Christian today and you believe all that doctrine  and you're not at peace, you're not thinking. Isn't that something?

You're not thinking. See, there's a stupid piece and then there's a smart piece. Let me tell you the stupid piece. Stupid pieces. Ho, ho, ho, to the bottle I go, to heal my heart and drown my woe.

Now what's that? A couple, I'm going to pop a cork. I'm going to sit under a tree. I'm going to look at the  surface. I'm not going to think I'm going to bracket out.

See, if I think about all the things that  are going wrong in life and in the world, I'm just going to bracket it. I'm not going to think  as much. But the Paul is saying, if you're a Christian, you don't bracket out. You bracket in. You think big, big picture.

Everything's going to be okay. You know, if you really believe just the  basic Christian truth and you think it and think it and think about it, you're going to get peace. And if you don't have peace, you're not thinking. There's stupid piece and there's smart piece  and Christian's piece is not by making yourself stupid. It's by making yourself as aware of your  beliefs as thoughtful as possible.

That's only number one. Because if you first learn the  discipline of thinking, then secondly, there's the discipline of thinking. Because see how very  important that is in verse six. Paul says, don't be anxious. Okay, don't be anxious.

Fine. Well,  then what should we be doing? But make requests to God with thanksgiving. So thanksgiving is put  against anxiety. But look carefully here.

It's a little counterintuitive, isn't it? See, what we  would say is you make your request to God and then you get your request and if you get your requests,  you think. I don't know what it says. It says you thank him as you make the request. Well, why should I thank him?

As I'm making the request, John, I want to wait until I see what he's  going to do. No. Paul says you're never going to be content unless you make your request. That  means you acknowledge that life is in his hands and you thank him for whatever he's going to do. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God.

Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to  face every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365 day devotional, the songs of Jesus,  you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a  regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start. And if you already spend time  in study and prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest  emotions and questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with him. We'll send you  Tim and Kathy Keller's devotional is our thanks for your gift to help Gospel and Life share the  love of Jesus with more people.

Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash give. That's  gospelandlife.com slash give. You're never going to get contentment unless you see this. Now this is a heading. You might say  subheading, underthinking.

That's why I put it thinking, then thanking. But now listen,  we already talked about this. God did not make the world to be a world filled with sorrow and death  and violence and suffering. But he's got a plan. He's got a plan to renew it.

He's got a plan to  get it back. And the plan is put in the abstract in Romans 8, 28, where it says,  if you love God, God is working everything together for good in your life. Absolutely,  everything, even the bad things, even the things that he hates, the things that he didn't put  into this world. He is going to weave into a plan, a tapestry. He's going to put everything  together and he's going to weave it all together for your good and his glory.

That's an abstraction. Here's the concrete. On the day that Jesus Christ was crucified, all of his friends  would have looked up and said, I can't believe this. The good he was doing, the people he was healing,  the people's lies he was changing. I can't believe this happened.

I can't believe  that these charges were trumped up. I can't believe they're doing this. And you would have said,  I can't believe the God could bring anything good out of this. You would have gone home,  senders. Absolutely no way.

God could bring anything good out of this. And you were looking  straight at the greatest thing God has ever done toward the redemption of the world. But you  couldn't get it into your little brain at the moment as to how that could possibly be. And God  is saying that is just the prime example of what I'm doing in everybody's life. Even the terrible  things that are happening to you, I'm working out for good.

I'm only saying this because I'm like  a little rat and when I push down a bar and I get food, I push it again. So I'll tell you this story  again because you always like it. The most vivid example of this for me was when in my early 20s  I prayed for a year, oh, there's a girl that I wanted to date and she was breaking up with me. I was a girl. I was thinking of marrying and she wanted to break up with me.

I was all week,  all year. I said, Lord, don't let her break up with me. Of course, it was the wrong girl. Wasn't the one sitting out here looking at me with a grin on her face right now. But I actually helped God.

I mean, I actually did what I could to help God with the prayer  because she was that one summer near the very end of the relationship. She was working at a  a poke, you know, a resort for the summer in a poke, and I got a job as a short order cook at  the same resort. I was saying, Lord, I'm making this as easy as possible for you. You know,  I've asked for this prayer and I'm just, you know, I'm taking the distance down everything. But I look back at it.

God was saying, my son, when a child of mine makes a request. I always give that person what he or she would have asked for if they knew everything I know. Do you believe that? To the degree you believe that, you're going to have peace. And if you don't believe it, you don't have peace.

And whose fault is that? Is it God's? See, make your request known with Thanksgiving. So there's thinking,  that's the first discipline. And if you do that, then thinking is the second discipline,  but loving, loving is the last one.

And where do we get that? Well,  notice Paul doesn't just say, think on what is true, what is noble, what is right. And by the way,  you know what it says, think about such things? That is, the Greek word there means to drill down. It means to ponder.

It means to not over chew, over meditate. It doesn't just mean think about. It just means, it just means, you know, just continually pound these things into your head. But see, the first three have more to do with the mind. Whatever is true, whatever is noble,  whatever is right.

But then look, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable, whatever is excellent. This is attraction. This is love. He says, not enough just to think on the right things. It's also  important to love the right thing.

And here we have to go to St. Augustine. St. Augustine,  great Christian thinker, lived in the third and fourth century. He was completely aware,  profoundly aware of the problem in Greek philosophy.

And it had been for years. In fact,  Paul's referring to it. The great problem is, how can you live a life of contentment? And the Greek word for that was adorakia. And that's the very word Paul uses twice in 11 and 12.

He says, I've learned. I've got the adorakia. It means to be independent of circumstances. It means to have this poise. It means to have this power.

And not to be upset, devastated,  you know, melted down, freaking out over anything. Always poised. And of course, as you might guess,  the philosophers that really worked that out were the Stoics. And what the Stoics taught was,  the reason why most people are not able to live, contented, you know, lies of equilibrium,  is that they love the wrong things. You should never love success.

If you set your heart on success,  even if you get successful, you'll always be anxious. You'll never have peace because you'll be  afraid of losing it. And of course, if you don't get it, you'll even be worse. And you shouldn't  set your heart primarily on family. Because even if you get a good family, you'll always be worried  about it.

You'll always be anxious, you see, for something to go wrong with the family. And if  the something goes wrong with the family, you know, you'll be devastated. So the philosophers were  saying, here's the problem. You're loving things that you're not in control of. And therefore,  they said, don't you dare give your heart to anything but your own virtue.

That's what the  philosopher said. That's what's certain with the Stoics said. Most of them. Because the virtue is  something you can control. You can't control success.

It has so much to do with circumstances. You can't control your family. Things can go wrong with your family. You can't control this,  you can't control that. So don't set your heart on anything you can't control.

That's what they  said. And then you will know tranquility. Set your heart only on your own virtue. You can be courageous,  you can be have integrity, you can be honest. Set your heart only on the only thing that should  really truly make you content is to know that you are being the person you want to be.

That's  under your control. Nothing else is. And Saint Augustine said, you guys have completely missed the  boat. If you think that your virtue is under your control, it is not. Listen, if you say,  the thing I'm going to live for is success.

And you've set off, yeah, it's not certain you're going  to have success. But if you say the thing that matters to me is that I be the person I want to be,  to live according to my principles, you know, living according to my virtues. He says,  that's every bit is uncertain. You don't have control over that. You're human being.

You're frail. And if you fail, then you've got nothing. Augustine says, you got it wrong. You shouldn't be loving  things out there and you shouldn't be loving anything in here. And then he said, only love of the  immutable can bring tranquility.

Only love of the immutable. What's the immutable? That which cannot  change. Your virtue can change. Don't give me this stuff about control.

He says, your problem is  that our problem, the reason we don't have pieces, we're loving mutable things, things that  circumstances, including our virtue can take away from us. But there's one thing that's immutable  that not only can circumstances not take it away from you, but even the worst circumstances in  this life only give you more of it. Have you thought about that? What's the worst circumstances? Violent death.

And there's one thing that if you love it supremely, even violent death gives you  more of it. What is it? The presence of God, the beauty of God, the face of God. And that's the  reason why Augustine could say this and it was just amazing. In his confessions, he lays it out.

First of all, he says this. In confessions, this is book four. He says, God alone is the place  of peace that cannot be disturbed. And God will not withhold Himself from your love unless you  withhold your love from Him. See, there it is.

If you love the immutable, you'll have tranquility. So how can you not love the immutable only if you withhold your love from Him? But if you don't withhold your love from Him, you will not withhold His love from you. And you might say, and at some point, Augustine being a great writer was hearing an objection. And the objection goes like this.

The objection says, well, no, wait a minute. You're saying I have to love God, but I love a lot of things. I love material comforts. I love  people. I love romance.

I love, you know, there's lots of things. I have to love God not these things. And he says, no, no, no. But you have to say that if you love God supremely, you not only get God  the immutable, but you will find that all that what you have been loving in these things  was actually in God. He puts it like this.

He's praying. Augustine writes, quote, what do I love  when I love thee? Not the beauty of bodies, nor the fair harmony of time, nor the brightness of the  light, so glads into our eyes, nor sweet melodies of varied songs, nor the fragrance, smell of flowers. Not limbs acceptable to the embracements of the flesh. None of these things I love when I love my God.

But and yet I love a kind of light melody, fragrance, meet an embracement when I love my God. But they are those which space cannot contain, which time cannot bear away. They are smells that  breathing cannot disperse. They are taste that eating cannot diminish. This is what I love when I  love my God.

And that's the final way to get the calm, to get the tranquility, to get the peace. It's to love him supremely. Now, finally, I told you character of peace, the three disciplines of  peace, but the secret, Paul talks about the secret. And this is why we're not done yet. And here's why  we're not done yet.

Try to go home and love the immutable. Just go ahead. And then tell me,  you know, write a paper and tell me how it went. I mean, just go home and sit down, find a nice quiet  place, sit down, and then try. Go.

Just try to love the immutable. And then I'm not feeling  anything yet. See, God is just a term. God is just, he's an abstraction, frankly. The word God is  just an abstraction.

But notice what it says, the secret of the peace of heart of God, or maybe I should  say the peace of God keeps your hearts and your minds, not just in God, but in Christ Jesus. And by the way, hearts and minds have separated there grammatically because Paul's trying to say,  it's one thing to keep your thoughts in Christ Jesus. We already talked about this. It's another  thing to put your heart in him, to have your heart in Christ Jesus. How does it work?

To find  him attractive, to find him lovely, to find him unbelievably lovely. See, it's not enough. It  says, Paul says, I want you to find Jesus Christ lovely. That's the only way you're ever going to  love the immutable and find that trend of quality. Well, how do you do that?

Think like this. There's  a place, actually, we read this. It was in a passage we looked at earlier this year, but we didn't  look at the verse. It's in Isaiah 57. Remember, when we're going through Isaiah?

Isaiah 57,  near the, at the end of the chapter says this, the wicked are like the tossing sea,  which cannot rest whose waves cast up myron mud. There is no peace, says my God, for the wicked. The wicked are like the tossing sea, which cannot rest whose waves cast up myron mud. There is no peace, says my God, for the wicked. Now, at first sight, this just looks like another one  of these Old Testament statements, God will smite the evil doers, but no, look, this is talking about  natural consequences.

And the stomachs had it right, and Augustin had it right. If you love anything  more than God, I don't just mean it's important to believe in God, of course, you have to believe in  God, but if you love anything more than God, if you live for anything more than God, your life  is going to be like a tossing sea, restless, constantly casting up myron mud,  because your life is like a house built on sand instead of on the rock, and you're always  going to be having cave-ins. We've been through it. If you love anything, you're going to  always be an anxiety about it. Anything more than God.

And so God is saying the natural consequence  of turning away from me, the natural consequence of not building your whole life,  centering your whole life on me, is restlessness, deep restlessness. Who took those consequences? You know, in 2 Corinthians 521, we always, that I always  quote, God made Jesus sin, who knew no sin, that we might become the righteous of God and him,  and how I always try to point out that doesn't mean that God made Jesus sinful. It means on the  cross he treated him as the sinners deserve. And what does this mean?

On the cross, he got all the  consequences of what we have done. And this is one of them. And can't you see it? Do you see Jesus Christ just walking through the crucifixion saying, I'm just keeping my mind  centered on God? I'm okay.

I'm content in whatever circumstance I'm in. Jesus didn't say that. No,  because he wasn't. Why? Because he lost all of his peace.

He cries, my God, my God,  why hast thou forsaken me? In fact, we're told that he died with a cry. He died screaming. Bill Lane, the commentator on the book of Mark, says, he says, the cry of dereliction. That  screaming says crucified criminals ordinarily suffered complete exhaustion.

And for long periods were  unconscious before they died. The stark realism of Mark's account describes a sudden violent death. The cry of dereliction expresses unfathomable pain. Jesus lost all of his peace. All of his peace.

So you could have eternal peace. And looking at that is what we'll get you  through. That's what we'll make him lovely. And let me prove it to you. We've got a case right  in front of you.

Horatio Spafford was an American lawyer who lost everything he had in the Chicago  Fire of 1871. Only two years later, he sent his wife Anna and their four daughters on a ship  across the Atlantic Ocean to England for a trip. The ship hit another ship on the way and began to  sink. As was sinking, Anna got the four little girls together and they prayed. And then the ship  went under the water and they all were scattered into the waves.

And all four good little girls  drowned. Anna was found unconscious by a rescue ship floating. They rescued her. They took her to England  and she cabled Horatio Spafford just two words, saved alone. And when Horatio Spafford was on the ship  over to England to bring his wife home, he began to write a hymn that we're going to sing at the end.

Is well with my soul, peace like a river. He wrote that. And here's what I want you to think. Why would a  man dealing with his grief, seeking the peace of God, the peace like a river, spent the entire  thing on Jesus? My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought, my sin, not in part, but the whole,  is nailed to the cross.

And I bear it no more. Praise the Lord, praise the Lord on my soul. What is  that got to do with his four little girls that are dead? Everything. You know why?

Look, when things  go wrong, one of the ways you lose your peace as you say, maybe I'm being punished, but no,  look at the cross. All the punishment fell on him. Another thing you say is, well, maybe God  doesn't care, maybe doesn't care. And no, look what he did for us. Look what he bore for us.

The Bible gives you a God that says, I've lost the child too, but not involuntarily, voluntarily for  your sake. You sing that hymn and you watch a man thinking, thanking and loving himself into  the peace of God. It worked for him under those circumstances. It worked for Paul under his  circumstances. It worked for you.

Let's pray. Thank you, Father, for giving us this offer, peace,  like a river, peace and fallible. We see, Lord, that peace is not something that really does just come  it's not a talent and it's really not even just a simple gift. It's a discipline. We have a number  of beliefs that we're not thinking into.

We have a wonderful God that we're not loving  and therefore we don't have the peace we ought to have. Give us this peace because we know the secret  how we can be thankful for even the bad things in our lives. It's the cross. How we can know that  God is with us no matter what it's the cross and we pray that you would help us knowing the gospel  of Jesus Christ. Think and thank and love you into the peace of God.

It's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

今天，提摩太·凯勒将探讨圣灵所结果子中的一个。今天早上的经文来自保罗写给腓立比人的书信第四章第4到12节。你们要靠主常常喜乐。我再说，你们要喜乐。

当叫众人知道你们谦让的心。主已经近了，应当一无挂虑，只要凡事藉着祷告、祈求，和感谢，将你们所要的告诉神。神所赐出人意外的平安，必在基督耶稣里，保守你们的心怀意念。弟兄们，我还有未尽的话，凡是真实的，凡是可敬的，凡是公义的，凡是清洁的，凡是可爱的，凡是有美名的，若有什么德行，若有什么称赞，这些事你们都要思念。

你们在我身上所学习的，所领受的，所听见的，所看见的，这些事你们都要去行，赐平安的神就必与你们同在。我靠主大大地喜乐，因为你们思念我的心如今又发生，你们向来就思念我，只是没有机会。我并不是因缺乏说这话，我无论在什么景况，都可以知足，这是我已经学会了。

我知道怎样处卑贱，也知道怎样处丰富，或饱足、或饥饿、或有余、或缺乏，随事随在，我都得了秘诀。这是主的道。圣经的前提是，道德上受约束的心和超自然改变的心之间是有区别的。

通过意志力来控制、压制内心天然的自我中心和不安全感，与通过圣灵的大能看到它被永久改变，这两者之间是有区别的。在加拉太书第五章中，有一个超自然改变的心的特质和特征的清单。它们被称为圣灵的果子。仁爱、喜乐、和平、忍耐。这是一个经典的清单。

每周我们都会选取其中一个特质，并选取一段描述它的经文，试图明白如何在我们自己的生命中拥有更多这种超自然改变的心。今天，我们来看平安。平安。我们将从这段经典经文中学习三件事。平安的特征，获得平安的纪律，三个纪律，以及秘密。

保罗用了"秘密"这个词，平安的秘密。平安的特征，平安的纪律，和平安的秘密。现在，喜乐的反面是悲伤或绝望、哀愁。但平安的反面是焦虑、恐惧和使人衰弱的忧虑。所以你看在第6节，它说，应当一无挂虑，而解药就是神所赐的平安。

顺便说一下，这个"挂虑"这个词不是正常的，它不是正常的关心和关切。如果你爱某人，如果你爱某事，如果你爱任何东西，你就会自动承担随之而来的爱的负担和关切。但这个词实际上意味着被撕裂，被使人衰弱的忧虑和恐惧撕成碎片。那么这神所赐的平安是什么？有两件事，从一开始说起。

保罗告诉我们关于它的两件事。首先，它是一种内在的平静和平衡。因为在下面，在第11和12节中，他说，我已经学会了无论在什么景况都可以知足。我已经学会了在各种处境中都知足的秘诀，也就是说，我在这种情况下和在另一种情况下是一样的。那就是镇定、平衡、内在的平静。

第二，让我们想想他的处境。你看你和我，在纽约这里，我们花钱是为了获得镇定。他把钱花在药丸上，把钱花在治疗上，把钱花在，这些东西，你知道，是我们可能需要的。但我们试图获得镇定，获得平衡来面对什么，你知道，我们的账单，竞争，老板，我们的约会，我们缺乏约会。这些是我们感到紧张的事情，我们对此感到焦虑，我们真的在努力应对。

而保罗正在面对酷刑和死亡。他在监狱里。他说，我已经学会了能够对此微笑的秘密。仔细看，保罗有说吗，你知道为什么我能对酷刑和死亡微笑，因为我就是那种人。我是个硬汉。

不。看，那是天赋。看，天赋是你生来就有的。你就是有。我就是那种家伙。

他没有那么说。我学会了这个。他说，我学会了它。这是什么意思？事实上，这对我来说并不自然。

对你也不自然。我学会了它。这种平静让我在任何情况下都能保持这种平衡。但这不是唯一的事情。保罗告诉我们关于这平安特征的第二件事。

它不仅仅是没有恐惧。它是某种东西的存在。特别是，它是一种被保护的感觉。因为在英语中这并没有表达得很好。第7节说，神所赐的平安必保守你们的心怀意念。

"保守"这个词是一个军事用词。它是一个非常生动的词。它意味着带一群士兵，带一支军队，用这支军队包围一座城市来保护它免受入侵。所以如果你有一支军队在外面，你就会睡得很香。你知道，有整支军队在那里。我不必担心掠夺者或任何人。你知道，我晚上可以安心睡觉。这涉及到一些非常重要的东西。我们马上就会看到这一点。在古代和现代。

当人们试图给出如何变得平静的建议时。他们几乎总是谈论移除某些想法。不要想那个。不要那样想。不要想那些负面的想法。停止想那个。停止想那个。控制你的思想。你知道，驱逐负面思想。这就是你获得平静的方式。

但是在这里我们看到神所赐的平安不是某些想法的缺失。而是神自己的同在。赐平安的神必与你们同在。基督徒的平安不是驱逐负面思想。驱逐负面思想的问题是，你真正在做的只是拒绝面对事情有多糟。你知道，你不是在现实面前。好的，我要通过不面对事实来获得平静。本质上，基督徒的平安不是你停止面对事实，而是你生命中得到了某样东西，一种活的能力进入你的生命，使你能够战胜那些事实，把你提升到它们之上并穿过它们。这是一种被保护的感觉。你知道，我，你，我们许多人都经历过，我想，许多信徒都经历过这种神所赐的平安。

但在我作为牧师参与的一些情况中，我看到人们经历过这种超越、超出我们所能真正理解的神所赐的平安。我看到一些人在可怕的情况下，悲惨的情况下，在某些情况下，面对所爱之人的暴力死亡。出乎意料。这只是最糟糕的处境。通常，当你在生活中顺利前行时，突然你所爱的人被暴力地从你的生命中夺走。在那个时候，你感到不受保护。你感到脆弱。你感到暴露。你感到被蹂躏。然而，有时我看到基督徒经历完全相反的情况。

他们在这样的时候感到被保护，好像一切。不知何故，他们有一种感觉，神与他们同在，一切都会好起来。他们感到被保护。他们确切地知道事情有多糟，但他们有某种东西使他们能够战胜它。如果你曾经在海岸边，在暴风雨中看到海浪冲击岩石，有时海浪如此巨大，以至于淹没了你可能正在观看的某块岩石。你会说，那块岩石完了。那块岩石不可能还在那里。当海浪退去时，它就在那里。一动不动。保罗就是这样的。

如果你读他的生平，一波接一波，他被打，他被石头砸，他被犁，他遭遇船难。他们追杀他。他们试图杀死他。他被背叛。一波接一波接一波。这是明显的历史事实。他说得对。当他说，我已经找到了一种在任何情况下都完全镇定的方法。他是那块岩石。所有生命的波浪都无法击倒他。

他说，这不是一种天生的才能。你可以学会这个。所以这就是基督徒平安的特征。它是一种内在的平静和由此而来的平等生活，但也是一种神同在的感觉和几乎是超越理性的他的保护感。第一，第二，那么你可以通过什么纪律来培养这种平安？因为实际上，保罗在这里给出了很多建议，很多关于如何培养这种平安并拥有这神所赐的平安的建议。有三个纪律。我将它们命名为思考、感恩和爱。我知道第三个应该也是TH开头的，但我想不出来。思考、感恩和爱。

思考。注意第8节。他说，弟兄们，凡是真实的，凡是可敬的，凡是公义的，凡是清洁的。这些事你们都要思念。赐平安的神必与你们同在。所以第一件事是思考。这真的很重要。非常重要。让我们看看这个长清单的前三个。思念凡是真实的、可敬的、公义的。现在这听起来相当笼统、一般，不是吗？

凡是真实的、可敬的、公义的？但是当保罗，这是保罗。当保罗在保罗书信和他的著作中使用这些词，这些特定的希腊词时，他谈论的是教义。他谈论的是圣经关于神、关于罪、关于基督、关于救恩、关于世界和人性以及神对世界的计划和救赎计划的教导。这就是他所说的。这太令人惊讶了。他说，如果你想要平安，就要思考教义。思考你所知道的关于生命、关于神的事情，这与你走进一家巴诺书店或博德斯书店，去焦虑、忧虑、压力、应对压力、如何放松的区域时会发现的完全不同。你拿出一本书，这些书永远不会这样做。永远不会。

这些书永远不会说，所以你有压力，你焦虑。让我们从问大问题开始。生命的意义是什么？你真正在这里是为了什么？你的生命是关于什么的？你从哪里来，要到哪里去？我的意思是，人类应该把时间花在做什么？永远不会。你认为这会让一个现代纽约人缓解压力吗？当然不会。

为什么？原因是他们直接跳到技巧。他们从不要求你思考。他们从不说，让我们思考大问题，你知道，它们是关于什么的？让我们从全局来看。从不。他们跳到技巧。他们跳到放松技巧。他们跳到工作和休息的平衡。例如，他们会说，看，每个季度几次，去某个地方，坐在海滩上，看着海浪，把其他所有事情都放在一边，停止担心思考其他一切。

或者他们会给你思想控制技巧，处理负面思想、负面情绪、内疚感等等。他们永远不会告诉你去思考。他们会告诉你实际上他们直接跳到技巧。原因如下。让我给你读两段话。你不想担心，我稍等一下，但让我给你读两段有趣的引文。这是查尔斯·达尔文的。查尔斯·达尔文说，引用：一个对人格神的存在没有确信信仰、对来世的存在没有报应或奖赏信仰的人。据我所见，这样的人只能以跟随最强烈的冲动和本能，或者任何他认为最好的东西作为他的生活准则。小奥利弗·温德尔·霍姆斯。

你知道，伟大的最高法院大法官。20世纪早期相当了不起的知识分子。在他的一次私人通信中，他曾这样写给一位朋友。他说，没有理由认为人具有不同于狒狒或一粒沙子的重要性。这个世界产生了我和响尾蛇，但如果我有机会，我会杀死它。唯一的原因是它与我想要的世界不协调。每个人都在根据自己的力量试图创造世界。现在，顺便说一下，小奥利弗·温德尔·霍姆斯因此受到了很多批评。他是最高法院大法官。他说，你知道，没有理性的理由说人类真的比动物或石头更有价值、更重要。

天哪，人们都说，但你知道吗，他的传记作者说，你知道，他只是在推导出其中的含义。如果你不相信神，这就是达尔文所说的。我认为你不相信神。你相信你在这里是偶然的。当你死了，你就腐烂了，就是这样。当太阳死了，一切都消失了。因此，人类试图完成的任何事情都不会积累成任何东西。好吧，这意味着什么？其中之一是没有对错。你可能感觉有对错。

达尔文说，你可能有感觉，但你的感觉不应该压倒其他人的。你可以感觉到它，但没有对错。真的没有办法告诉人们他们应该如何生活。霍姆斯是对的。归根结底，一个人是什么，我们是这些力量的产物，我们有一天会消失，凭什么说，你知道，它可能感觉比动物或石头更重要，但你不是。传记作者说的是，霍姆斯只是在思考不相信有神或生命有目的的含义。好吧，我认识很多纽约人有同样的信仰。很多同样的人有同样的信仰。也就是说，他们有同样的信仰。他们不认为有神。

他们认为事物是偶然存在的。但他们会说那样思考，推导出其中的含义是病态的。好的，看，很好。说的很好，让我们不要推导出含义是病态的，但我想让你看看你在做什么。你通过不思考你信仰的含义来获得平安，而保罗说基督徒的平安恰恰相反。基督徒的平安来自思考其中的含义，思考。看，什么是真实的和正确的？什么是基督教教义？神，有一位神，他创造我们是为了与他相交，他创造了一个完美的世界，你知道，一个原本没有悲伤、疾病或死亡的完美世界。他想和我们一起生活在其中，当然一切都出了问题，我们背离了他，世界破碎了，但他差遣他的儿子来到世界拯救我们，他正在预备一个新天新地。

我们将永远与他同住。看看你的价值，看看未来现在是安全的这一事实。这意味着什么？如果你今天是基督徒，你相信所有那些教义，你却不平安，你就是没有在思考。这不是很神奇吗？你没有在思考。看，有一种愚蠢的平安，也有一种聪明的平安。让我告诉你什么是愚蠢的平安。愚蠢的平安是。嗬嗬嗬，我去拿瓶酒，来医治我的心，淹没我的悲伤。

现在那是什么？几个，我要开瓶酒。我要坐在树下。我要看海浪。我不去思考，我要把它放在一边。看，如果我想生活中和世界上所有出错的事情，我就会把它放在一边。我不会想那么多。但保罗说，如果你是基督徒，你不要放在一边。你要放进来。你要想大局，大图景。一切都会好起来。你知道，如果你真的相信基本的基督教真理，你思考它，思考它，思考它，你就会得到平安。如果你没有平安，你就是没有在思考。有愚蠢的平安，也有聪明的平安，基督徒的平安不是通过使自己愚蠢。而是通过使自己尽可能地意识到你的信仰，尽可能地深思熟虑。

这只是第一点。因为如果你首先学会思考的纪律，那么第二，就有感恩的纪律。因为看这在第6节中有多重要。保罗说，应当一无挂虑。好的，应当一无挂虑。很好。那么，我们应该做什么？但要带着感恩将你们所要的告诉神。所以感恩与焦虑对立。但仔细看这里。这有点违反直觉，不是吗？看，我们会说的是，你向神祈求，然后你得到你的请求，如果你得到你的请求，你就感恩。我不知道它说什么。它说你在提出请求时就要感恩。嗯，为什么我应该感恩？

当我提出请求时，约翰，我想等到看看他会怎么做。不。保罗说，你永远不会知足，除非你提出你的请求。那意味着你承认生命在他手中，你为他将要做的任何事感恩。诗篇可以深刻地塑造你接近神的方式。即使耶稣也依靠诗篇来面对每一种情况，包括死亡。在提姆和凯西·凯勒的365天灵修《耶稣的诗篇》中，你会找到每日阅读诗篇的内容，带有全新的圣经洞察。如果你没有定期的灵修习惯，这本书是开始的绝佳方式。如果你已经花时间学习和祷告，那么阅读和祷告诗篇可以帮助你把你最深的情感和问题带到神面前，发现与他的新层次的亲密关系。我们将把提姆和凯西·凯勒的灵修书送给你，作为对你帮助"福音与生活"与更多人分享耶稣的爱的礼物的感谢。今天就在gospelandlife.com/give索取你的副本。那是gospelandlife.com/give。你永远不会得到满足，除非你看到这一点。现在这是一个标题。你可以说是小标题，在思考之下。

这就是为什么我说思考，然后感恩。但现在听着，我们已经谈过这个。神没有把世界造成一个充满悲伤、死亡、暴力和苦难的世界。但他有一个计划。他有一个更新它的计划。他有一个计划要把它找回来。这个计划在罗马书8章28节中抽象地说出来，那里说，如果你爱神，神正在使你生命中的万事互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处。绝对地，一切，甚至是坏事，甚至是他憎恨的事，他没有放进这个世界的事。他要把它编织进一个计划，一幅挂毯。他要把一切都放在一起，他要把它们全部编织在一起，为了你的益处和他的荣耀。

那是一个抽象概念。这是具体的。在耶稣基督被钉十字架的那一天，他所有的朋友都会抬头说，我不敢相信。他所做的善事，他所医治的人，他所改变生命的人。我不敢相信这发生了。我不敢相信这些指控是捏造的。我不敢相信他们这样做。你会说，我不敢相信神能从中带来任何好事。你会回家，寄出。绝对不可能。神能从中带来任何好事。你正直视神为救赎世界所做的最伟大的事。但你当时无法把它放进你的小脑袋里，不知道那怎么可能。神说这只是我在每个人生命中所做之事的主要例子。即使是发生在你身上的可怕事情,我也在使之互相效力,叫你得益处。

我说这个只是因为我像一只小老鼠,当我按下杠杆就得到食物时,我会再按一次。所以我会再给你讲这个故事,因为你们总是喜欢它。对我来说最生动的例子是,在我20岁出头时,我祷告了一年,哦,有一个女孩我想约会,她要和我分手。我是个女孩。我在想娶她,但她想和我分手。我一整年都很虚弱。我说,主啊,不要让她和我分手。当然,她是错误的女孩。不是现在坐在那里看着我笑的那个人。但我实际上帮助了神。我的意思是,我实际上尽我所能帮助神实现这个祷告,因为那年夏天快结束时,她在波科克,你知道,一个度假村工作整个夏天,我在同一个度假村找了一份短期厨师的工作。我说,主啊,我让这对你来说尽可能容易。你知道,我已经祈求了这个祷告,我只是,你知道,我把距离缩短了一切。但我回头看。

神在说,我的孩子,当我的一个孩子提出请求时。我总是给那个人他或她会要求的东西,如果他们知道我所知道的一切。你相信吗？你相信的程度,就是你将拥有平安的程度。如果你不相信,你就没有平安。那是谁的错？是神的错吗？看,带着感恩将你们所要的告诉神。所以有思考,那是第一个纪律。如果你做到了,那么感恩是第二个纪律,但爱,爱是最后一个。

我们从哪里得到这个？嗯,注意保罗不只是说,思念凡是真实的、可敬的、公义的。顺便说一下,你知道它说的吗,思念这些事？也就是说,那里的希腊词意味着深入钻研。它意味着思考。它意味着不是过度咀嚼,过度冥想。它不只是意味着思考。它只是意味着,你知道,不断地把这些东西灌进你的头脑。但看,前三个更多地与头脑有关。凡是真实的、可敬的、公义的。

但然后看,凡是可爱的、有美名的、优秀的。这是吸引力。这是爱。他说,仅仅思念正确的事情是不够的。爱正确的事情也很重要。在这里我们必须回到圣奥古斯丁。圣奥古斯丁,伟大的基督教思想家,生活在第三和第四世纪。他完全意识到,深刻意识到希腊哲学中的问题。

多年来一直如此。事实上,保罗提到了这个。最大的问题是,你如何能过一种满足的生活？这方面的希腊词是adorakia。这正是保罗在第11和12节中用了两次的词。他说,我已经学会了。我有了adorakia。它意味着独立于环境。它意味着拥有这种镇定。它意味着拥有这种力量。

不因任何事而心烦意乱、崩溃、瓦解、惊慌失措。总是镇定。当然,正如你可能猜到的,真正推导出这一点的哲学家是斯多葛派。斯多葛派教导的是,大多数人不能过满足的、你知道的、平衡的生活的原因是,他们爱错了东西。你永远不应该爱成功。如果你把心放在成功上,即使你成功了,你也总是会焦虑。你永远不会有平安,因为你会害怕失去它。当然,如果你没有得到它,你会更糟。你不应该主要把心放在家庭上。因为即使你有一个好家庭,你也会总是担心它。

你会总是焦虑,你看,怕家庭会出什么问题。如果家庭出了什么问题,你知道,你会崩溃。所以哲学家们说,问题在这里。你爱的是你无法控制的东西。因此,他们说,除了你自己的美德,你千万不要把你的心给任何东西。这就是哲学家说的。这就是斯多葛派确定说的。他们中的大多数。因为美德是你可以控制的东西。你无法控制成功。

它与环境有很大关系。你无法控制你的家庭。你的家庭可能会出问题。你无法控制这个,你无法控制那个。所以不要把心放在任何你无法控制的东西上。这就是他们说的。然后你就会知道平静。把心只放在你自己的美德上。你可以勇敢,你可以有正直,你可以诚实。把心只放在唯一应该真正让你满足的东西上,就是知道你正在成为你想成为的人。

那是在你的控制之下。其他都不是。圣奥古斯丁说,你们完全错了。如果你认为你的美德在你的控制之下,它不是。听着,如果你说,我要为之而活的是成功。你出发了,是的,你不一定会成功。但如果你说对我来说重要的是我成为我想成为的人,按照我的原则生活,你知道,按照我的美德生活。他说,那同样不确定。你无法控制那个。你是人。你很脆弱。如果你失败了,那你什么都没有了。

奥古斯丁说,你错了。你不应该爱那里的东西,你也不应该爱这里的任何东西。然后他说,只有对不变者的爱才能带来平静。只有对不变者的爱。什么是不变者？那不能改变的。你的美德可以改变。别给我讲控制的事。他说,你的问题是,我们的问题,我们没有平安的原因是,我们爱的是可变的东西,环境可以从我们这里夺走的东西,包括我们的美德。但有一件事是不变的,不仅环境无法从你那里夺走它,甚至今生最糟糕的环境只会给你更多的它。你想过这个吗？什么是最糟糕的环境？暴力死亡。

有一件事,如果你至高地爱它,即使暴力死亡也会给你更多的它。那是什么？神的同在,神的美,神的面。这就是为什么奥古斯丁能说这个,这真是令人惊讶。在他的《忏悔录》中,他阐明了这一点。首先,他说了这个。在《忏悔录》中,这是第四卷。他说,唯有神是不能被扰乱的平安之所。神不会向你隐藏他自己,除非你向他隐藏你的爱。看,就是这样。如果你爱不变者,你就会有平静。

那么你怎么能不爱不变者,只有当你向他隐藏你的爱？但如果你不向他隐藏你的爱,他就不会向你隐藏他的爱。你可能会说,在某个时候,奥古斯丁作为一个伟大的作家正在听到一个反对意见。反对意见是这样的。反对意见说,嗯,不,等一下。你说我必须爱神,但我爱很多东西。我爱物质上的舒适。我爱人。我爱浪漫。

我爱,你知道,有很多东西。我必须爱神,而不是这些东西。他说,不,不,不。但你必须说,如果你至高地爱神,你不仅得到了不变的神,而且你会发现你在这些东西中所爱的一切实际上都在神里面。他这样说。他在祷告。奥古斯丁写道,引用,当我爱你时,我爱的是什么？不是身体的美,也不是时间的公平和谐,也不是光的明亮,因此光进入我们的眼睛感到高兴,也不是各种歌曲的甜美旋律,也不是花的香气、气味。也不是可接受肉体拥抱的四肢。当我爱我的神时,我不爱这些东西。

但然而我爱一种光、旋律、香气、食物和拥抱。但它们是空间无法容纳的,时间无法带走的。它们是呼吸无法驱散的气味。它们是进食无法减少的味道。这就是当我爱我的神时我所爱的。这就是获得平静、平静、平安的最后方法。就是至高地爱他。现在,最后,我告诉过你平安的特征,平安的三个纪律,但秘密,保罗谈到了秘密。这就是为什么我们还没有完成。这就是为什么我们还没有完成。

试着回家去爱不变者。就去吧。然后告诉我,你知道,写一篇论文告诉我进展如何。我的意思是,就回家坐下,找一个安静的地方,坐下来,然后试试。开始。就试着去爱不变者。然后我还没有感觉到任何东西。看,神只是一个术语。神只是,坦白说,他是一个抽象概念。"神"这个词只是一个抽象概念。

但注意它说的,心的平安的秘密,或者也许我应该说神所赐的平安,保守你们的心怀意念,不只是在神里面,而是在基督耶稣里。顺便说一下,心怀意念在这里在语法上是分开的,因为保罗试图说,把你的思想保守在基督耶稣里是一回事。我们已经谈过这个。把你的心放在他里面,把你的心放在基督耶稣里,又是另一回事。它是如何运作的？发现他有吸引力,发现他可爱,发现他令人难以置信地可爱。看,这还不够。它说,保罗说,我想让你发现耶稣基督是可爱的。这是你爱不变者并找到那种平静的唯一方法。

嗯,你怎么做到这一点？这样想。有一个地方,实际上,我们读过这个。这是我们今年早些时候看过的一段经文,但我们没有看那一节。它在以赛亚书57章。记得,当我们在学习以赛亚书时？以赛亚书57章,在这一章的结尾附近说了这个,恶人好像翻腾的海,不得平静,其中的水常涌出污秽和淤泥来。我的神说,恶人必不得平安。恶人好像翻腾的海,不得平静,其中的水常涌出污秽和淤泥来。我的神说,恶人必不得平安。现在,乍一看,这看起来只是另一个旧约的陈述,神将击打作恶的人,但不,看,这是在谈论自然后果。

斯多葛派是对的,奥古斯丁是对的。如果你爱任何东西超过神,我不只是说相信神很重要,当然,你必须相信神,但如果你爱任何东西超过神,如果你为任何东西活而不是为神活,你的生命将像翻腾的海,不安宁,不断涌出污秽和淤泥,因为你的生命就像建在沙土上而不是磐石上的房子,你总是会有塌陷。我们经历过这个。如果你爱任何东西,你总是会对它焦虑。任何超过神的东西。所以神在说,背离我的自然后果,不把你的整个生命建立在我身上、以我为中心的自然后果,就是不安宁,深深的不安宁。谁承受了这些后果？你知道,在哥林多后书5章21节,我总是,我总是引用,神使那无罪的,替我们成为罪,好叫我们在他里面成为神的义,我总是试图指出,这不意味着神使耶稣成为有罪的。这意味着在十字架上他像对待罪人应得的那样对待他。这意味着什么？

在十字架上,他得到了我们所做之事的所有后果。这就是其中之一。你难道看不到吗？你看到耶稣基督走过钉十字架时说,我只是保持我的头脑集中在神身上吗？我很好。我在任何环境中都知足。耶稣没有那么说。不,因为他不是。为什么？因为他失去了所有的平安。

他呼喊,我的神,我的神,为什么离弃我？事实上,我们被告知他带着呼喊死去。他尖叫着死去。比尔·莱恩,马可福音的注释者,说,他说,被遗弃的呐喊。那尖叫说,被钉十字架的罪犯通常遭受完全的衰竭。在他们死之前的很长时间里都是无意识的。马可记载的赤裸现实主义描述了一种突然的暴力死亡。被遗弃的呐喊表达了深不可测的痛苦。耶稣失去了他所有的平安。他所有的平安。

这样你就可以拥有永恒的平安。看着这一点将帮助你度过难关。这将使他变得可爱。让我向你证明。我们面前就有一个案例。霍雷肖·斯帕福德是一位美国律师,在1871年的芝加哥大火中失去了他所拥有的一切。仅仅两年后,他把妻子安娜和他们的四个女儿送上一艘船,穿越大西洋去英国旅行。这艘船在途中撞上了另一艘船,开始下沉。当它下沉时,安娜把四个小女孩聚在一起,她们祷告。然后船沉入水中,她们都被分散到海浪中。

所有四个好孩子都淹死了。安娜被救援船发现时已经失去知觉,漂浮着。他们救了她。他们把她带到英国,她给霍雷肖·斯帕福德发电报,只有两个字,独自获救。当霍雷肖·斯帕福德在去英国接妻子回家的船上时,他开始写一首我们将在结束时唱的赞美诗。

我心灵安好,平安如江河。他写了那个。这就是我想让你思考的。为什么一个处理他的悲伤、寻求神所赐平安、平安如江河的人,把整个东西都花在耶稣身上？我的罪,哦,这荣耀思想的福分,我的罪,不是部分,而是全部,被钉在十字架上。我不再承担它。赞美主,赞美主,哦我的灵魂。这与他四个死去的小女儿有什么关系？一切。

你知道为什么吗？看,当事情出错时,你失去平安的一种方式是你说,也许我正在被惩罚,但不,看十字架。所有的惩罚都落在他身上。另一件你说的事是,好吧,也许神不在乎,也许不在乎。不,看他为我们做了什么。看他为我们承受了什么。圣经给你一位神说,我也失去过孩子,但不是非自愿的,而是为了你的缘故自愿的。你唱那首赞美诗,你看着一个人思考、感恩和爱自己进入神所赐的平安。

它在那种环境下对他有效。它在保罗的环境下对他有效。它对你有效。让我们祷告。父啊,感谢你给我们这个应许,平安,如江河,坚不可摧的平安。主啊,我们看到,平安不是真正只是来的东西,它不是一种才能,它甚至真的不只是一个简单的礼物。它是一个纪律。我们有许多信念,我们没有思考进去。我们有一位奇妙的神,我们没有爱,因此我们没有我们应该有的平安。给我们这平安,因为我们知道秘密,我们如何能对我们生命中的坏事都感恩。是十字架。

我们如何能知道无论如何神都与我们同在,是十字架,我们祷告你帮助我们知道耶稣基督的福音。思考、感恩并爱你进入神所赐的平安。奉耶稣的名祷告。阿们。

今天提姆·凯勒将探讨圣灵的果子之一。今晨的经文来自保罗写给腓立比人的信，第4章第4至12节。要常常在主里喜乐。我再说一遍，要喜乐。

让众人都知道你们的温柔。主已经近了，应当一无挂虑，只要凡事藉着祷告、祈求和感谢，将你们所要的告诉神。神所赐出人意外的平安，必在基督耶稣里保守你们的心怀意念。末了，弟兄们，凡是真实的、凡是可敬的、凡是公义的、凡是清洁的、凡是可爱的、凡是有美名的，若有什么德行，若有什么称赞，这些事你们都要思念。

你们在我身上所学习的、所领受的、所听见的、所看见的，这些事你们都要去行。赐平安的神就必与你们同在。我靠主大大地喜乐，因为你们思念我的心如今又发生了。你们向来就思念我，只是没有机会显明。我并不是因缺乏说这话。

因为我已经学会了，无论在什么境况都可以知足。我知道怎样处卑贱，也知道怎样处丰富。我已经得了秘诀，无论在任何情况之下，或饱足、或饥饿，或有余、或缺乏，都可以知足。这是主的话语。圣经的前提是，道德上受约束的心与超自然改变的心之间是有区别的。

通过意志力来控制、压制内心天生的自我中心和不安全感，与通过圣灵的能力看到它被永久改变，这两者之间是有区别的。在加拉太书第5章，有一份关于超自然改变之心的特征和品质的清单。它们被称为圣灵的果子。仁爱、喜乐、和平、忍耐。这是一份经典的清单。

每周我们都会选取其中一种品质，并选取一段描述它的经文，试图理解我们如何能在自己的生活中拥有更多这种超自然改变的心。今天，我们来看平安。平安。我们将从这段经典中学到三件事

经文。平安的特质、纪律、获得平安的三个纪律，以及秘密。

保罗使用了这个词，平安的秘密。平安的特质、平安的纪律，以及平安的秘密。现在，喜乐的反面是悲伤或绝望、忧伤。但平安的反面是焦虑、恐惧和使人衰弱的忧虑。所以你在第6节这里看到，它说，不要为任何事情焦虑，而解药就是神的平安。

顺便说一下，这个"焦虑"这个词不是正常的，它不是正常的关心和担忧。如果你爱某个人，如果你爱某件事，如果你爱任何东西，你就会自动地承担随之而来的爱与关切的负担。但这个词实际上意味着被撕裂，被使人衰弱的忧虑和恐惧撕成碎片。那么这个神的平安是什么呢？首先要说两件事。

保罗告诉我们关于它的两件事。首先，它是一种内在的平静和平衡。因为在底部这里，在第11节和第12节，他说，我已经学会了在任何环境中如何知足。我已经学会了在每种情况下都知足的秘密，也就是说，我在一种情况下和在另一种情况下是一样的。那就是沉着、平衡、内在的平静。

第二，让我们想想他的处境。看，你和我，在纽约这里，我们花钱是为了获得沉着。他在药片上花钱，他在治疗上花钱，他在这些东西上花钱，你知道，这些可能是我们需要的东西。但我们试图获得沉着，镇定的平衡来面对什么，你知道，我们的账单、竞争、老板、我们的约会、我们缺少约会。这些事情，这些是我们感到紧张和焦虑的事情，我们真的在努力应对它。

而保罗正面临着酷刑和死亡。他在监狱里。他说，我已经学会了能够对此微笑的秘密。仔细看，保罗有说，你知道我为什么能在酷刑和死亡面前微笑，因为我就是那种人吗？我是个硬汉。

不。看，那是才能。看，才能是你与生俱来的东西。你就是有这个。我就是那种人。他

并没有那样说。我学会了这一点。他说，我已经学会了。这是什么意思呢？事实上，这对我来说并不自然。

对你来说也不自然。我学会了它。这种平静使我在任何情况下都能保持这种平衡。但这还不是全部。保罗告诉我们关于这种平安特质的第二件事。

它不仅仅是没有恐惧。它还是某种东西的存在。特别是，它是一种被保护的感觉。因为这在英语中表达得不够充分。经文第七节说，神的平安必在基督耶稣里保守你们的心怀意念。

"保守"这个词是一个军事用语。这是一个非常生动的词。它的意思是派遣一群士兵，调动一支军队，用这支军队包围一座城市，保护它免受入侵。所以如果外面有一支军队，你就会睡得很安稳。你知道，外面有整支军队。

我不必担心掠夺者或任何人。你知道，我晚上安然入睡。这触及了一个非常重要的问题。我们马上就会看到这一点。无论在古代还是在现代。

当人们试图就如何获得平静给出建议时。他们几乎总是谈论移除某些想法。不要想那个。不要那样想。不要想那些负面的想法。

停止想那个。停止想那个。控制你的思想。你知道，驱除负面想法。这就是你如何获得平静的方法。

但在这里我们看到，神的平安不是没有某些想法。而是神自己的同在。赐平安的神必与你们同在。基督徒的平安不是驱除负面想法。驱除负面想法的问题在于，你实际上只是拒绝面对事情有多糟糕。

你知道，你不够现实。好的，我要通过不面对事实来获得平静。本质上，基督徒的平安不是你停止面对事实，而是你的生命中得到了某种东西，一种活的力量进入你的生命，使你能够战胜那些事实，把你从中提升起来并带领你度过它们。这是一种被保护的感觉。你知道，我，你，我们许多人都经历过，我想，许多信徒都经历过这种

神的平安。

但在我作为牧师所见证的情况中，我看到有些人经历了这种超越、超过理解的神的平安，超越了我们所能解释的任何东西。我看到一些人在可怕的处境中，悲剧的处境中，在某些情况下，他们面对所爱之人的暴力死亡。毫无预料。这是最糟糕的处境。通常，当你在生活中一帆风顺时，突然你所爱的人就这样从你的生命中被夺走，暴力地。

在那个时候，你会感到毫无保护。你感到脆弱。你感到暴露在外。你感到被蹂躏。然而，有时我看到基督徒经历了完全相反的情况。

他们在这样的时刻感到被保护，就像一切一样。不知何故，他们有一种感觉，神与他们同在，一切都会好起来的。他们感到被保护。他们完全知道事情有多糟糕，但他们有某种东西使他们能够战胜它。如果你曾经在海岸边，在暴风雨中看到海浪冲击岩石，有时海浪如此巨大，以至于淹没了你可能正在观察的某块岩石。

你会说，那块岩石完了。那块岩石不可能还在那里。当海浪退去时，它就在那里。一寸都没有移动。保罗就是这样。

如果你读他的生平，一波接一波，他被殴打，被石头打，被鞭打，遭遇船难。他们追杀他。他们试图杀死他。他被背叛。一波接一波接一波。

这是明显的历史事实。他说得对。当他说，我已经找到了一种方法，在任何情况下都能完全保持镇定。他就是那块岩石。生活的所有波浪都无法击垮他。

他说，这不是天生的才能。你可以学会这个。这就是基督徒平安的特征。它是一种内在的平静和由此而来的均衡生活，也是一种神同在的感觉，以及一种几乎超越理性的对他保护的感知。第一点，第二点，那么你可以通过什么操练来培养这种平安呢？

因为实际上，保罗在这里给出了很多建议，很多关于你如何能够

发展这一部分，也拥有神的这一部分。这里有三个操练。我把它们命名为思考、感恩和爱。我知道第三个应该也是TH开头，但我想不出来。思考、感恩和爱。

思考。注意第八节。他说，弟兄们，凡是真实的、凡是可敬的、凡是公义的、凡是清洁的。要思念这些事，赐平安的神就必与你们同在。所以第一件事是思考。

这真的很重要。非常重要。让我们看看这个长列表的前三项。思想凡是真实的、可敬的、公义的。现在这听起来很笼统、很一般，不是吗？

凡是真实的、可敬的、公义的？但当保罗，这是保罗。当保罗使用这些词，这些特定的希腊词汇在保罗书信集和他的著作中，他是在谈论教义。他在谈论圣经关于神、关于罪、关于基督、关于救恩、关于世界和人性以及神对世界的计划和救恩计划的教导。这就是他在谈论的。

这很令人惊讶。他是在说，如果你想要平安，就思考教义。思考你所知道的，关于生命、关于神、关于这些事。这与你走进Barnes and Noble书店或Borders书店，去到焦虑、担忧、压力、处理压力、如何放松的书架那里，拿出一本书所发现的完全不同。这些书永远不会这样做。永远不会。

这些书永远不会说，所以你压力很大，你自己很焦虑。让我们从问大问题开始。生命的意义是什么？你真正在这里是为了什么？你的生命到底是关于什么的？

你从哪里来，要往哪里去？我是说，人类应该把时间花在做什么？永远不会。你认为这对一个现代纽约人来说能缓解压力吗？当然不能。

为什么？这就是为什么他们直接讲技巧。他们永远不会让你思考。他们永远不会说，让我们思考大问题，你知道，关于什么的？让我们把事情放在正确的视角中。

永远不会。他们直接讲技巧。他们讲放松技巧。他们讲工作、休息

平衡。例如，他们会说，看，每个季度几次，去某个地方，坐在海滩上，看着海浪，然后把其他一切都括起来，停止担心思考其他事情。

或者他们会给你思想控制技巧，处理负面想法、负面情绪、内疚想法等等。他们永远不会告诉你去思考。他们会告诉你实际上，他们直接进入技巧。原因如下。让我给你读两段。

你不想担心，我要暂停一下，但让我给你读两段有趣的引文。这是查尔斯·达尔文。查尔斯·达尔文说，引用："一个对人格神的存在没有确定信仰，对有报应或奖赏的来世没有信仰的人。据我所见，这样的人只能以最强烈的冲动和本能，或者在他看来最好的冲动和本能，作为他的生活准则。"小奥利弗·温德尔·霍姆斯。

你知道，伟大的最高法院大法官。20世纪初一位相当杰出的知识分子。在他的一次私人通信中，他曾给一位朋友写道："没有理由赋予人类与狒狒或一粒沙子所属的意义在本质上不同的意义。这个世界产生了我和响尾蛇，但如果我有机会，我会杀死它。

唯一的理由是因为它与我想要的世界不协调。每个人都在试图根据自己的力量创造世界。"顺便说一句，小奥利弗·温德尔·霍姆斯因此受到了很多抨击。他是最高法院大法官。他说，你知道，没有理性的理由说人类真的比动物或石头更有价值、更重要。

哦，天哪，人们都震惊了，但你知道吗，他的传记作者说，你知道，他只是在推演其含义。如果你不相信上帝，这就是达尔文所说的。我认为你不相信上帝。你相信你是偶然来到这里的。当你死了，你就腐烂了，就这样。

当太阳死了，一切都消失了。因此，人类曾经试图完成的任何事情都不会有任何意义。好吧，那么

这意味着什么呢？其中一个含义就是没有对错之分。你可能觉得有对错之分。

达尔文说，你可能有一种感觉，但你的感觉不应该凌驾于别人的感觉之上。你可以感受到它，但没有对错之分。实际上没有办法告诉人们应该如何生活。霍姆斯是对的。归根结底，人类不过是这些力量的产物，我们总有一天会消失，你可能觉得比动物或石头更重要，但事实并非如此。

传记作者说，霍姆斯只是在思考不相信有上帝或生命有目的的含义。好吧，我认识很多有同样信念的纽约人。很多人有同样的信念。也就是说，他们有同样的信念。他们不认为有上帝。

他们认为万物的存在只是偶然。但他们会说，那样思考、推演其含义是病态的。好吧，好的。说这样的话很好，不要去推演那些含义，认为那是病态的，但我想让你看看你在做什么。你通过不去思考你信念的含义来获得平安，而保罗说的是，基督徒的平安恰恰相反。

基督徒的平安来自于思考其含义，思考。看，什么是真实和正确的？什么是基督教教义？上帝，有一位上帝，祂创造我们是为了与祂相交，祂创造了一个完美的世界，你知道，一个最初没有悲伤、疾病或死亡的完美世界。祂想与我们一起生活在其中，当然一切都出了问题，我们背离了祂，世界破碎了，但祂差遣祂的儿子来到世上拯救我们，祂正在预备新天新地。

我们将永远与祂同住。看看你的价值，看看未来现在是安全的这一事实。这意味着什么？如果你今天是一个基督徒，你相信所有这些教义，但你却没有平安，那你就是没有思考。这不是很有意思吗？

你没有思考。看，有愚蠢的平安，也有聪明的平安。让我告诉你什么是愚蠢的平安。愚蠢

碎片。嗬，嗬，嗬，我要去拿瓶子，来治愈我的心，淹没我的悲伤。

这是什么？一对情侣，我要开瓶塞。我要坐在树下。我要看着表面。我不打算思考，我要把它排除在外。

你看，如果我思考生活和世界上所有出错的事情，我只会把它排除掉。我不会想太多。但保罗说，如果你是基督徒，你不要排除在外。你要包含进来。你要想大局。

一切都会好起来的。你知道，如果你真的相信最基本的基督教真理，你思考它、思考它、思考它，你就会得到平安。如果你没有平安，那是因为你没有在思考。有愚蠢的平安，也有聪明的平安，基督徒的平安不是通过让自己变愚蠢来获得的，而是通过让自己尽可能地意识到你的信仰、尽可能地深思熟虑来获得的。

这只是第一点。因为如果你首先学会思考的纪律，那么其次，就是思考的纪律。因为看看第六节中这有多么重要。保罗说，不要焦虑。好的，不要焦虑。

好吧，那我们应该做什么？而是带着感恩向神祈求。所以感恩与焦虑相对。但仔细看这里。

这有点反直觉，不是吗？你看，我们会说的是你向神提出请求，然后你得到你的请求，如果你得到你的请求，你会想。我不知道它说什么。它说你在提出请求时就感谢他。好吧，为什么我要感谢他？

当我提出请求时，约翰，我想等到我看到他要做什么。不。保罗说，除非你提出你的请求，否则你永远不会满足。这意味着你承认生命在他手中，你为他将要做的任何事感谢他。诗篇可以深刻地塑造你接近神的方式。

甚至耶稣也依靠诗篇来面对每一种情况，包括死亡。在提姆和凯西·凯勒的365天灵修书《耶稣的诗歌》中，你会找到每日阅读诗篇的内容，以及新鲜的圣经洞见。如果你还没有定期的灵修习惯，这本书是一个很好的开始方式

开始。如果你已经花时间学习和祷告，那么通过《诗篇》来阅读和祷告可以帮助你将最深层的情感和问题带到神面前，并发现与他的新层次的亲密关系。我们将寄给你蒂姆和凯西·凯勒的灵修材料，作为对你帮助"福音与生命"与更多人分享耶稣之爱的礼物的感谢。

今天就在gospelandlife.com/give索取你的副本。网址是gospelandlife.com/give。除非你看到这一点，否则你永远无法得到满足。现在这是一个标题。你可能会说是副标题，属于思考之下。

这就是为什么我把它放在思考之后，然后是感恩。但现在听着，我们已经讨论过这个。神创造这个世界不是为了让它充满悲伤、死亡、暴力和苦难。但他有一个计划。他有一个更新它的计划。

他有一个计划要把它夺回来。这个计划在罗马书8章28节中以抽象的方式呈现，经文说，如果你爱神，神就会在你的生命中让万事互相效力，使你得益处。绝对是万事，即使是坏事，即使是他所憎恨的事，他没有放入这个世界的事。他要把它们编织成一个计划，一幅挂毯。他要把一切放在一起，他要把它们全部编织在一起，为了你的益处和他的荣耀。

这是一个抽象的说法。这里是具体的。在耶稣基督被钉十字架的那一天，他所有的朋友都会抬头说，我不敢相信这一切。他所做的善事，他所医治的人，他所改变的人的生命。我不敢相信发生了这种事。

我不敢相信这些指控是捏造的。我不敢相信他们在做这件事。你会说，我不敢相信神能从这件事中带出任何好事。你会回家，伤心欲绝。绝对不可能。

神能从这件事中带出任何好事。而你正在直视神为救赎世界所做的最伟大的事。但你当时无法让你那小小的大脑理解这怎么可能是好事。神说这只是我在每个人生命中所做之事的主要例子。即使是发生在你身上的可怕事情，我也在成就

永远如此。

我之所以说这个,是因为我就像一只小老鼠,当我按下杠杆得到食物时,我会再次按下。所以我会再次告诉你们这个故事,因为你们总是喜欢它。对我来说最生动的例子是,在我二十出头的时候,我祈祷了一年,哦,有一个我想约会的女孩,她要和我分手。我是个男孩。我在考虑娶她,但她想和我分手。

整整一周,整整一年。我说,主啊,不要让她和我分手。当然,她是错误的女孩。不是现在坐在这里看着我、脸上带着笑容的那位。但我实际上帮了上帝的忙。

我的意思是,我实际上尽我所能来帮助上帝实现这个祷告,因为那年夏天快到关系结束的时候,她在一个波克,你知道的,一个度假胜地工作了一个夏天,在一个波克,我在同一个度假胜地找到了一份快餐厨师的工作。我说,主啊,我让这对你来说尽可能容易。你知道,我已经祈求了这个祷告,我只是,你知道,我在缩短距离和一切。但我回顾这件事。

上帝在说,我的儿子,当我的一个孩子提出请求时,我总是给那个人他或她本来会要求的东西,如果他们知道我知道的一切的话。你相信这个吗?你相信的程度,决定了你会有平安的程度。如果你不相信,你就没有平安。

那这是谁的错?是上帝的错吗?看,带着感恩让你的请求被知晓。所以有思考,这是第一个操练。如果你这样做,那么思考是第二个操练,但爱,爱是最后一个。

我们从哪里得到这个?嗯,注意保罗不只是说,思想那些真实的、高尚的、正确的事。顺便说一下,你知道它说什么吗,思想这些事?也就是说,那里的希腊词意味着深入钻研。它意味着沉思。

它意味着不是过度咀嚼,过度默想。它不只是意味着思考。它只是意味着,你知道,不断地把这些东西敲进你的脑袋里。但看,前三个更多与头脑有关。凡是真实的,凡是高尚的,凡是正确的。

但接着看,凡是可爱的,

无论什么是令人钦佩的，无论什么是卓越的。这就是吸引力。这就是爱。他说，仅仅思想正确的事情是不够的。爱正确的事情也很重要。

在这里我们必须谈到圣奥古斯丁。圣奥古斯丁，伟大的基督教思想家，生活在三、四世纪。他完全意识到，深刻地意识到希腊哲学中的问题。

实际上已经存在多年了。事实上，保罗指的就是这个问题。最大的问题是，你如何能过一种知足的生活？希腊语中的这个词是adorakia。这正是保罗在第11节和第12节中两次使用的词。

他说，我已经学会了。我拥有了adorakia。这意味着不受环境影响。这意味着拥有这种镇定。这意味着拥有这种力量。

不会因为任何事情而沮丧、崩溃，你知道的，瓦解，惊慌失措。始终保持镇定。当然，正如你可能猜到的，真正阐述这一点的哲学家是斯多葛派。斯多葛派教导说，大多数人无法过着知足、平衡的生活的原因，是因为他们爱错了东西。你永远不应该爱成功。

如果你把心放在成功上，即使你成功了，你也会总是焦虑。你永远不会有平安，因为你会害怕失去它。当然，如果你没有得到它，你会更糟。你也不应该把心主要放在家庭上。因为即使你有一个好的家庭，你也会总是为它担心。你总会焦虑，你看，担心家庭会出什么问题。如果家庭出了什么问题，你知道的，你会崩溃。所以哲学家们说，问题就在这里。你在爱那些你无法控制的东西。因此，他们说，除了你自己的美德之外，你绝对不要把心交给任何东西。

这就是哲学家们所说的。这就是斯多葛派的说法。他们中的大多数。因为美德是你可以控制的东西。你无法控制成功。

它与环境有很大关系。你无法控制你的家庭。你的家庭可能会出问题。你无法控制这个，你无法控制那个。所以不要把心

任何你无法控制的事情上。

他们是这样说的。然后你就会知道什么是宁静。只把你的心放在你自己的美德上。你可以勇敢，你可以拥有正直，你可以诚实。只把你的心放在唯一真正应该让你满足的事情上，就是知道你正在成为你想成为的那个人。

这是在你的控制之下的。其他都不是。而圣奥古斯丁说，你们完全搞错了。如果你认为你的美德在你的控制之下，事实并非如此。听着，如果你说，我要为之而活的是成功。

你已经出发了，是的，但你不一定能获得成功。但如果你说对我重要的是我成为我想成为的人，按照我的原则生活，你知道的，按照我的美德生活。他说，这同样是不确定的。你对此没有控制权。你是人类。

你是脆弱的。如果你失败了，那你就一无所有。奥古斯丁说，你错了。你不应该爱外面的东西，你也不应该爱这里面的任何东西。然后他说，只有对不变之物的爱才能带来宁静。

只有对不变之物的爱。什么是不变的？那就是不能改变的。你的美德会改变。别跟我说什么控制。

他说，你的问题是我们的问题，我们没有平安的原因，是我们在爱那些可变的东西，环境可以从我们这里夺走的东西，包括我们的美德。但有一样东西是不变的，不仅环境无法从你这里夺走它，即使是今生最糟糕的境况也只会给你更多。你想过这个吗？什么是最糟糕的境况？暴力死亡。

有一样东西，如果你至高地爱它，即使是暴力死亡也会给你更多。那是什么？神的同在，神的美，神的面。这就是为什么奥古斯丁能够说出这样的话，这真是令人惊叹。在他的《忏悔录》中，他阐明了这一点。

首先，他这样说。在《忏悔录》第四卷中。他说，唯有神是不能被扰乱的平安之所。神不会拒绝把自己赐给你的爱，除非

你从祂那里收回你的爱。看，就是这样。

如果你爱那不变的，你就会有宁静。那么你怎么会不爱那不变的呢？除非你从祂那里收回你的爱。但如果你不从祂那里收回你的爱，你就不会从你那里收回祂的爱。你可能会说，在某个时刻，作为一位伟大作家的奥古斯丁听到了一个反对意见。这个反对意见是这样的。

反对意见说，不，等等。你说我必须爱上帝，但我爱很多东西。我爱物质享受。我爱人。我爱浪漫。

我爱，你知道，有很多东西。我必须爱上帝而不是这些东西。而他说，不，不，不。但你必须明白，如果你至高无上地爱上帝，你不仅得到上帝这个不变者，而且你会发现你一直在这些事物中所爱的一切实际上都在上帝里面。他是这样说的。

他在祷告。奥古斯丁写道，引用：当我爱祢时，我爱的是什么？不是身体的美丽，不是时间的美好和谐，不是那喜悦我们眼睛的光的明亮，不是各种歌曲的甜美旋律，不是花朵的芳香气味。不是肉体拥抱所接受的肢体。当我爱我的上帝时，我不爱这些东西中的任何一样。

但是，然而，当我爱我的上帝时，我爱一种光、旋律、芳香、食物和拥抱。但它们是那些空间无法容纳的，时间无法带走的。它们是呼吸无法驱散的气味。它们是进食无法减少的味道。这就是当我爱我的上帝时我所爱的。

这就是获得平静、获得宁静、获得平安的最终方式。就是至高无上地爱祂。现在，最后，我告诉了你平安的特征、平安的三个操练，但这个秘密，保罗谈到了这个秘密。这就是为什么我们还没有完成。这就是为什么我们还没有完成。

试着回家去爱那不变的。就去做吧。然后告诉我，你知道，写一篇文章告诉我进展如何。我的意思是，就回家坐下，找一个安静的地方，坐下来，然后尝试。去吧。

就试着去爱那不变的。然后我还没有感觉到任何东西。看，上帝只是一个词。上帝只是，祂是一个抽象概念，

坦率地说，神这个词只是一个抽象概念。

但请注意它所说的，神的内心平安的秘密，或者也许我应该说神的平安保守你们的心和你们的意念，不只是在神里面，而是在基督耶稣里。顺便说一句，心和意念在这里被语法上分开，因为保罗试图说，把你的思想保守在基督耶稣里是一回事。我们已经谈过这个了。把你的心放在他里面，让你的心在基督耶稣里，又是另一回事。这是如何运作的呢？

要发现他有吸引力，要发现他可爱，要发现他难以置信地可爱。看，这还不够。保罗说，我要你发现耶稣基督是可爱的。这是你能够爱那不变者并找到那种品质的唯一方式。那么，你如何做到这一点呢？

这样想。有一个地方，实际上，我们读过这段经文。这是在我们今年早些时候查考过的一段经文中，但我们没有看那节经文。它在以赛亚书57章。记得吗，当我们在学习以赛亚书的时候？

以赛亚书57章，在这章的末尾附近这样说，恶人好像翻腾的海，不得平静，其中的水常涌出污秽和淤泥来。我的神说，恶人必不得平安。恶人好像翻腾的海，不得平静，其中的水常涌出污秽和淤泥来。我的神说，恶人必不得平安。现在，乍一看，这只是另一个旧约的陈述，神要击打作恶的人，但不是的，看，这是在谈论自然后果。

斯多葛学派说对了，奥古斯丁也说对了。如果你爱任何事物胜过爱神，我不只是说相信神很重要，当然，你必须相信神，但如果你爱任何事物胜过爱神，如果你为任何事物而活胜过为神而活，你的生命将会像翻腾的海，不得安息，不断涌出污秽和淤泥，因为你的生命就像建在沙土上而不是建在磐石上的房子，你将总是会遇到坍塌。我们已经经历过了。如果你爱任何事物，你将总是为它焦虑。任何胜过神的事物。

所以神在说，离开我的自然后果，转离我的自然后果

不将你的整个生命、你生命的中心建立在我身上的后果，就是不安，深深的不安。谁承受了这些后果？你知道，在哥林多后书5章21节，我总是引用的那节经文，神使那无罪的替我们成为罪，好叫我们在他里面成为神的义，我总是试图指出，这并不意味着神使耶稣变得有罪。这意味着在十字架上，他按罪人应得的待遇对待他。这意味着什么呢？

在十字架上，他承受了我们所做之事的一切后果。这就是其中之一。难道你看不出来吗？你看到耶稣基督只是走过钉十字架的过程，说着，我只是将我的心意集中在神身上吗？我没事。

无论在什么环境中我都知足。耶稣没有这样说。没有，因为他并非如此。为什么？因为他失去了所有的平安。

他呼喊，我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？事实上，我们被告知他带着呼喊死去。他死时在尖叫。比尔·莱恩，马可福音的注释者，说，他说，那绝望的呼喊。那尖叫说明被钉十字架的罪犯通常会遭受完全的精疲力竭。

而且在死前会长时间失去意识。马可记载的赤裸现实描述了一个突然的暴力死亡。那绝望的呼喊表达了深不可测的痛苦。耶稣失去了他所有的平安。所有的平安。

为了让你能拥有永恒的平安。而仰望那一幕将使你渡过难关。那将使他显得可爱。让我向你证明这一点。我们眼前就有一个例子。

霍雷肖·斯帕福德是一位美国律师，在1871年的芝加哥大火中失去了他所拥有的一切。仅仅两年后，他把妻子安娜和他们的四个女儿送上一艘横渡大西洋前往英格兰旅行的船。这艘船在途中撞上了另一艘船，开始下沉。在下沉的时候，安娜把四个小女孩聚集在一起，她们祷告了。然后船沉入水中，她们都被冲散到波浪中。

四个乖巧的小女孩都溺水身亡了。安娜被一艘救援船发现时已经失去意识，漂浮在水面上。他们救起了她。他们把她带到英格兰，她给霍雷肖·斯帕福德发了电报，只有两个字，独自获救。当霍雷肖·斯帕福德正在

船到英格兰接他的妻子回家时，他开始写一首赞美诗，我们将在结束时唱这首诗。

我心灵得安宁，平安如江河。他写下了这首诗。我想让你们思考的是，为什么一个正在处理悲痛、寻求神的平安、如江河般的平安的人，会把整首诗都放在耶稣身上？我的罪，哦，这荣耀思想的喜乐，我的罪，不是部分，而是全部，都钉在了十字架上。

我不再承担它。赞美主，赞美主，我的灵魂。这和他四个死去的小女儿有什么关系？一切关系。你知道为什么吗？

看，当事情出错时，你失去平安的方式之一是你说，也许我正在受惩罚，但不是的，看十字架。所有的惩罚都落在了他身上。你说的另一件事是，嗯，也许神不在乎，也许不在乎。不，看他为我们做了什么。看他为我们承受了什么。

圣经给你一位神，他说，我也失去了孩子，但不是非自愿的，而是为了你的缘故自愿的。你唱那首赞美诗，你看着一个人思考、感恩、爱自己进入神的平安。这在那种情况下对他有用。这在保罗的情况下对他有用。这对你也有用。

让我们祷告。天父，感谢你给我们这个应许，平安，如江河，平安是确实的。主啊，我们看到，平安不是真正自然而来的东西，它不是天赋，甚至也不仅仅是简单的礼物。它是一种操练。我们有许多信念没有去思考。

我们有一位美好的神，我们没有去爱，因此我们没有应有的平安。求你赐给我们这平安，因为我们知道秘诀，我们如何能为生命中甚至是坏的事情感恩。就是十字架。我们如何能知道无论如何神与我们同在，就是十字架，我们祈求你帮助我们认识耶稣基督的福音。思考、感恩并爱你，进入神的平安。

我们奉耶稣的名祷告。阿们。
