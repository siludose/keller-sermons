## English Transcript / 英文原文

today as Tim Keller explores one of the fruit of the Spirit. The Scripture this morning is from Paul's letter to the Philippians chapter 4 verses 4 through 12. Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again. Rejoice.

Let the gentleness of your be evident to all. The Lord is near, do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petition with  thanksgiving present your requests to God. And the peace of God which transcends all understanding will  guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Finally, brothers, whatever is true  whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable. If anything is excellent or praiseworthy, think about such things.

Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me or seen in me, put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you. I rejoice greatly in the Lord that at last you have  renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you have been concerned but you had no opportunity to show it. I am not saying this because I am in need.

For I have learned to be content, whatever the  circumstances. I know what it is to be in need and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation whether well fed or hungry,  whether living in plenty or in want. This is the word of the Lord. The premise of the Bible is that there is a difference between a morally restrained heart  and a supernaturally changed heart.

There is a difference between controlling, suppressing  the natural self-centeredness and insecurity of the heart through willpower  and seeing it permanently changed through the power of the Holy Spirit. In the book of Galatians, chapter 5, there is a list of the traits,  characteristics of a supernaturally changed heart. They are called the fruit of the Spirit. Love, joy, peace, patience. It is a classic list.

And each week we are taking one of those  traits and taking a passage, the scripture that describes it and trying to come to understand  how we can have more of that supernaturally changed heart in our own lives. Today,  we look at peace. Peace. And we are going to learn three things from this classic passage. The character of peace, the disciplines, the three disciplines of getting peace, and the secret.

Paul uses that word, the secret of peace. The character of peace, the disciplines of peace,  and the secret of peace. Now, the opposite of joy is sadness or despair, grief. But the opposite of peace is anxiety, fear, and debilitating worry. So you see here in verse 6,  it says, don't be anxious about anything, and the antidote is the peace of God.

By the way,  this word anxious is not the normal, it's not normal care and concern. If you love somebody,  if you love something, if you love anything, you have the burden of love and concern that comes  with that automatically. But this is a word that actually means to be torn up, to be torn into pieces  by debilitating worry and fear. So what is this piece of God? Two things, just to start.

Two things that Paul tells us about it. First, it's an inner calm and equilibrium. Because here down at the bottom, in verse 11 and 12, he says, I've learned how to be content  in whatever circumstance. I've learned the secret of being content in every situation,  which is to say, I'm the same in one situation as the other. That's poise, equilibrium,  an inner calm.

And for a second, let's think about his circumstances. See you and I, here in New York, we spend money in order to get poise. He's spent money on pills,  he's spent money on therapy, he's spent money on, and these things, you know, are things that  might maybe we need. But we're trying to get up the poise, the equipoise to face what,  you know, our bills, competition, the boss, our date, our lack of dates. One of the, what you're  doing is, these are the things that we're, that we're nervous about and we're anxious about  and we're really working at it.

And Paul is facing torture and death. He's in prison. And he's  saying, I've learned the secret of being able to smile at that. And look carefully, does Paul say,  you know why I can smile on the face of torture and death because I'm just that kind of guy. I'm a tough cookie.

No. See that's, that's talent. See talent is something that you were born with. There you've got it. I'm just one of those guys.

He doesn't say that. I've learned this. He said,  I've learned it. What does that mean? It's not natural to me, in fact.

It's not natural to you either. I've learned it. This calm so that I've got this equilibrium in any situation. But that's not  the only thing. The second thing Paul tells us about the character of this piece.

It's not just  an absence of fear. It's the presence of something. In particular, it's a sense of being protected. Because that doesn't come out as well in English as it should. It says in verse seven,  the peace of God will guard your hearts and your minds.

The word guard is a military word. It's a very  vivid word. It means to take a bunch of soldiers to take an army and surround a city with the army  to protect it from invasion. So if you have an army out there, you sleep really well. You know,  there's a whole army out there.

I don't have to worry about marauders or anybody. You know,  I go to sleep at night. And this is getting at something very important. And we'll see this in a  minute. Both in the ancient times and in modern times.

When people try to give advice on how to  become. They almost always talk about removing certain thoughts. Don't think about that. Don't think  that. Don't think those negative thoughts.

Stop thinking about that. Stop thinking about that. Control your thoughts. You know, expel the negative thoughts. That's how you get calm.

But here we see the peace of God is not the absence of some thoughts. It's the presence  of God himself. The God of peace will be with you. Christian peace is not  expelling negative thoughts. The problem with expelling negative thoughts is what you're really  doing there is you're just refusing to face how bad things are.

You know, you're not being  realistic. Okay, I'm going to get calm by not facing the facts. Essentially, Christian peace  is not that you stop facing the facts, but you get something in your life, a living power that  comes into your life that enables you to triumph over those facts, lifts you up over and through them. And it's a sense of being protected. And, you know, I, you, lots of us have experienced, I think,  lots of believers have experienced this peace of God.

But in the situations that I have been present  as a pastor usually, where I've seen people experience this peace of God that passes, that transcends  understanding, that goes beyond anything we can really account for. I've seen some people in  horrible situations, tragic situations, in some cases, having faced some violent death of a loved  one. Unlooked for. That's just the worst kind of situation to be in. And ordinarily, when you're  cruising along in life and suddenly somebody who you love is just ripped out of your life, violent.

At that time, you feel unprotected. You feel vulnerable. You feel like exposed. You feel like  you feel ravaged. And yet, sometimes I've seen Christians experience exactly the opposite.

They feel, during times like that, protected, like everything. Somehow, they have a sense that  God is with them and everything is going to be okay. They feel protected. They know exactly how bad  things are, but they've got something that enables them to triumph over it. If you've ever been on a  coast and seen in a storm and seen the waves come in and hit the rocks, sometimes the waves are  so huge that it covers some rock you might be watching.

And you say, that's the end of that rock. No way that rock's going to be there. And when the waves receive, it's received there it is. Hasn't budged an inch. And Paul is like that.

If you read his life, wave after wave,  he's beaten, he's stoned, he's flawed, he's shipwrecked. They're after him. They're trying to kill  him. He's betrayed. Wave after wave after wave.

And it's a plain historical fact. He's right. When he  said, I have found a way to be completely poised under any circumstances. He's the rock. All the waves  of life could not break him.

And he says, this isn't a natural talent. You can learn this. So that's the character of Christian peace. It's an inner calm and an equal living that comes from  that, but also a sense of God's presence and almost a reason transcending sense of his protection. Number one, number two, what then are the disciplines by which you can develop this piece?

Because actually, Paul's giving lots of advice in here, lots of advice on how you can develop this  piece and have this piece of God too. And there's three disciplines. And I'll name them  thinking, thanking and loving. I know the third one should be a TH, but I couldn't figure it out. Thinking, thanking and loving.

Thinking. Notice verse eight. He says,  brethren, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure. Think on these  things and the God of peace will be with you. So the first thing is thinking.

And this is really  important. Really important. Let's take a look at the first three of this long list. Think about  whatever is true, noble, right. Now that sounds pretty general, generic, doesn't it?

Whatever is  true, noble, right? But when Paul, this is Paul. And when Paul uses these words, these particular  Greek words in the Pauline corpus and his writings, he's talking about doctrine. He's talking about  the teaching of the Bible about God, about sin, and about Christ, and about salvation, and about  the world and human nature and God's plans for the world and the plan of salvation. That's what he's  talking about.

And this is amazing. He's saying, if you want peace, think about doctrine. Think  about what you know, about life and about God and about, and this is so completely different  than what you're going to find if you walk into a Barnes and Noble Reborder's bookstore and you go  to the place on anxiety, worry, stress, dealing with stress, how to relax. And you get out of book,  and here's what the woman never do. Never.

None of these books will ever say, so you're stressed,  your own hat, anxious. Let's start by asking the big questions. What is the meaning of life? What are you really here for? What's your life all about?

Where have you come from and where are  you going? I mean, what should human beings spend their time doing? Never. You think that's  going to relieve stress to a modern New Yorker? Of course not.

Why? Here's why they go right to  technique. They never ask you to think. They never say, let's think about the big questions,  you know, what's they fall about? Let's put things in perspective.

Never. They go to techniques. They go to relaxation techniques. They go to work, rest balance. For example, they'll say,  look, a couple times, every quarter, go somewhere, sit on a beach, look at the surf, and just  bracket out and stop worrying about thinking about everything else.

Just, or they'll give you  thought control techniques about dealing with negative thoughts, the negative emotions,  guilt thoughts, and so forth. They will never tell you to think. They'll tell you to actually  they go right to technique. Here's why. Let me read you two.

You don't want to worry, I'm going  for a second, but let me read you two interesting quotes. Here's Charles Darwin. And Charles Darwin  said quote, a person who has no assured belief in the existence of a personal God  and no belief in a future existence with retribution or reward. Such a person can have for his  rule of life as far as I see, only to follow whatever impulses and instincts are the strongest  or whatever seems to him to be the best ones. Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.

You know, great Supreme Court justice. Quite a formidable intellectual in the early 20th century. And one of his personal correspondents, he once wrote this to a friend. He says, there is no reason  for attributing to a man a significance different in kind from that which belongs to a baboon  or a grain of sand. The world has produced me and the reddle snake, but I will kill it if I get  the chance.

And the only reason is because it is incongruous to the world I want. The world  everyone is trying to make according to one's own power. Now, by the way, Oliver Wendell Holmes  got a lot of heat for this. He's a Supreme Court justice. And he says, you know, there is no rational  reason to say that human being is really more valuable, more significant than an animal or a rock.

Oh my gosh, people have gone, but you know what, his biographers have said, you know, he's just  working out the implications. If you don't believe in God, this is what Darwin is saying. I think you don't believe in God. And you believe you're here by accident. And when you die, you rot,  that's it.

And when the sun dies, everything goes away. And therefore, nothing that human beings have  ever tried to accomplish will mount anything. Okay, what are the implications of that? One of them  is there is no right and wrong. You may feel there's right and wrong.

Darwin says, you may have a  feeling, but your feeling shouldn't trump anybody else's. You can feel it, but there is no right and wrong. There's really no way to tell people how they ought to live. Holmes is right. Ultimately, what a  human being is is just we've we're the product of these forces and we're going to go away someday  and what's to say that, you know, it may feel more significant than an animal or a rock, but you're  not.

And what the biographers said was Holmes was simply thinking out the implications of not  believing there's a God or there's a purpose in life. Well, I know plenty of New Yorkers that have  the same beliefs. Lots of the same people have the same beliefs. That is, they have the same beliefs. They don't think there's a God.

They think things are here by accident. But they would say to think  about it like that to work out the implications is morbid. Okay, look, fine. That's fine to say,  let's not think out the implications is morbid, but I want you to see what you're doing. You're getting your peace by not thinking out the implications of your beliefs,  whereas Paul is saying Christian peace is exactly the opposite.

Christian peace comes from  thinking out the implications, thinking. See, what are the true and the right? What's the Christian  doctrine? God, there's a God and He made us for fellowship with Him and He created a perfect world,  you know, a perfect world in which there's no sorrow or disease or death originally. And He wanted  to live with us in it and of course it's gone all wrong and we've turned from Him and the world  is broken but He's sent His Son into the world to rescue us and He's preparing a new heavens and  new earth.

We're going to live with Him forever. Look at your value, look at the fact that the future  is secure now. What does that mean? If you're a Christian today and you believe all that doctrine  and you're not at peace, you're not thinking. Isn't that something?

You're not thinking. See, there's a stupid piece and then there's a smart piece. Let me tell you the stupid piece. Stupid pieces. Ho, ho, ho, to the bottle I go, to heal my heart and drown my woe.

Now what's that? A couple, I'm going to pop a cork. I'm going to sit under a tree. I'm going to look at the  surface. I'm not going to think I'm going to bracket out.

See, if I think about all the things that  are going wrong in life and in the world, I'm just going to bracket it. I'm not going to think  as much. But the Paul is saying, if you're a Christian, you don't bracket out. You bracket in. You think big, big picture.

Everything's going to be okay. You know, if you really believe just the  basic Christian truth and you think it and think it and think about it, you're going to get peace. And if you don't have peace, you're not thinking. There's stupid piece and there's smart piece  and Christian's piece is not by making yourself stupid. It's by making yourself as aware of your  beliefs as thoughtful as possible.

That's only number one. Because if you first learn the  discipline of thinking, then secondly, there's the discipline of thinking. Because see how very  important that is in verse six. Paul says, don't be anxious. Okay, don't be anxious.

Fine. Well,  then what should we be doing? But make requests to God with thanksgiving. So thanksgiving is put  against anxiety. But look carefully here.

It's a little counterintuitive, isn't it? See, what we  would say is you make your request to God and then you get your request and if you get your requests,  you think. I don't know what it says. It says you thank him as you make the request. Well, why should I thank him?

As I'm making the request, John, I want to wait until I see what he's  going to do. No. Paul says you're never going to be content unless you make your request. That  means you acknowledge that life is in his hands and you thank him for whatever he's going to do. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God.

Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to  face every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365 day devotional, the songs of Jesus,  you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a  regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start. And if you already spend time  in study and prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest  emotions and questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with him. We'll send you  Tim and Kathy Keller's devotional is our thanks for your gift to help Gospel and Life share the  love of Jesus with more people.

That's why I put it thinking, then thanking. But now listen,  we already talked about this. God did not make the world to be a world filled with sorrow and death  and violence and suffering. But he's got a plan. He's got a plan to renew it.

He's got a plan to  get it back. And the plan is put in the abstract in Romans 8, 28, where it says,  if you love God, God is working everything together for good in your life. Absolutely,  everything, even the bad things, even the things that he hates, the things that he didn't put  into this world. He is going to weave into a plan, a tapestry. He's going to put everything  together and he's going to weave it all together for your good and his glory.

That's an abstraction. Here's the concrete. On the day that Jesus Christ was crucified, all of his friends  would have looked up and said, I can't believe this. The good he was doing, the people he was healing,  the people's lies he was changing. I can't believe this happened.

I can't believe  that these charges were trumped up. I can't believe they're doing this. And you would have said,  I can't believe the God could bring anything good out of this. You would have gone home,  senders. Absolutely no way.

God could bring anything good out of this. And you were looking  straight at the greatest thing God has ever done toward the redemption of the world. But you  couldn't get it into your little brain at the moment as to how that could possibly be. And God  is saying that is just the prime example of what I'm doing in everybody's life. Even the terrible  things that are happening to you, I'm working out for good.

I'm only saying this because I'm like  a little rat and when I push down a bar and I get food, I push it again. So I'll tell you this story  again because you always like it. The most vivid example of this for me was when in my early 20s  I prayed for a year, oh, there's a girl that I wanted to date and she was breaking up with me. I was a girl. I was thinking of marrying and she wanted to break up with me.

I was all week,  all year. I said, Lord, don't let her break up with me. Of course, it was the wrong girl. Wasn't the one sitting out here looking at me with a grin on her face right now. But I actually helped God.

I mean, I actually did what I could to help God with the prayer  because she was that one summer near the very end of the relationship. She was working at a  a poke, you know, a resort for the summer in a poke, and I got a job as a short order cook at  the same resort. I was saying, Lord, I'm making this as easy as possible for you. You know,  I've asked for this prayer and I'm just, you know, I'm taking the distance down everything. But I look back at it.

God was saying, my son, when a child of mine makes a request. I always give that person what he or she would have asked for if they knew everything I know. Do you believe that? To the degree you believe that, you're going to have peace. And if you don't believe it, you don't have peace.

And whose fault is that? Is it God's? See, make your request known with Thanksgiving. So there's thinking,  that's the first discipline. And if you do that, then thinking is the second discipline,  but loving, loving is the last one.

And where do we get that? Well,  notice Paul doesn't just say, think on what is true, what is noble, what is right. And by the way,  you know what it says, think about such things? That is, the Greek word there means to drill down. It means to ponder.

It means to not over chew, over meditate. It doesn't just mean think about. It just means, it just means, you know, just continually pound these things into your head. But see, the first three have more to do with the mind. Whatever is true, whatever is noble,  whatever is right.

But then look, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable, whatever is excellent. This is attraction. This is love. He says, not enough just to think on the right things. It's also  important to love the right thing.

And here we have to go to St. Augustine. St. Augustine,  great Christian thinker, lived in the third and fourth century. He was completely aware,  profoundly aware of the problem in Greek philosophy.

And it had been for years. In fact,  Paul's referring to it. The great problem is, how can you live a life of contentment? And the Greek word for that was adorakia. And that's the very word Paul uses twice in 11 and 12.

He says, I've learned. I've got the adorakia. It means to be independent of circumstances. It means to have this poise. It means to have this power.

And not to be upset, devastated,  you know, melted down, freaking out over anything. Always poised. And of course, as you might guess,  the philosophers that really worked that out were the Stoics. And what the Stoics taught was,  the reason why most people are not able to live, contented, you know, lies of equilibrium,  is that they love the wrong things. You should never love success.

If you set your heart on success,  even if you get successful, you'll always be anxious. You'll never have peace because you'll be  afraid of losing it. And of course, if you don't get it, you'll even be worse. And you shouldn't  set your heart primarily on family. Because even if you get a good family, you'll always be worried  about it.

You'll always be anxious, you see, for something to go wrong with the family. And if  the something goes wrong with the family, you know, you'll be devastated. So the philosophers were  saying, here's the problem. You're loving things that you're not in control of. And therefore,  they said, don't you dare give your heart to anything but your own virtue.

That's what the  philosopher said. That's what's certain with the Stoics said. Most of them. Because the virtue is  something you can control. You can't control success.

It has so much to do with circumstances. You can't control your family. Things can go wrong with your family. You can't control this,  you can't control that. So don't set your heart on anything you can't control.

That's what they  said. And then you will know tranquility. Set your heart only on your own virtue. You can be courageous,  you can be have integrity, you can be honest. Set your heart only on the only thing that should  really truly make you content is to know that you are being the person you want to be.

That's  under your control. Nothing else is. And Saint Augustine said, you guys have completely missed the  boat. If you think that your virtue is under your control, it is not. Listen, if you say,  the thing I'm going to live for is success.

And you've set off, yeah, it's not certain you're going  to have success. But if you say the thing that matters to me is that I be the person I want to be,  to live according to my principles, you know, living according to my virtues. He says,  that's every bit is uncertain. You don't have control over that. You're human being.

You're frail. And if you fail, then you've got nothing. Augustine says, you got it wrong. You shouldn't be loving  things out there and you shouldn't be loving anything in here. And then he said, only love of the  immutable can bring tranquility.

Only love of the immutable. What's the immutable? That which cannot  change. Your virtue can change. Don't give me this stuff about control.

He says, your problem is  that our problem, the reason we don't have pieces, we're loving mutable things, things that  circumstances, including our virtue can take away from us. But there's one thing that's immutable  that not only can circumstances not take it away from you, but even the worst circumstances in  this life only give you more of it. Have you thought about that? What's the worst circumstances? Violent death.

And there's one thing that if you love it supremely, even violent death gives you  more of it. What is it? The presence of God, the beauty of God, the face of God. And that's the  reason why Augustine could say this and it was just amazing. In his confessions, he lays it out.

First of all, he says this. In confessions, this is book four. He says, God alone is the place  of peace that cannot be disturbed. And God will not withhold Himself from your love unless you  withhold your love from Him. See, there it is.

If you love the immutable, you'll have tranquility. So how can you not love the immutable only if you withhold your love from Him? But if you don't withhold your love from Him, you will not withhold His love from you. And you might say, and at some point, Augustine being a great writer was hearing an objection. And the objection goes like this.

The objection says, well, no, wait a minute. You're saying I have to love God, but I love a lot of things. I love material comforts. I love  people. I love romance.

I love, you know, there's lots of things. I have to love God not these things. And he says, no, no, no. But you have to say that if you love God supremely, you not only get God  the immutable, but you will find that all that what you have been loving in these things  was actually in God. He puts it like this.

He's praying. Augustine writes, quote, what do I love  when I love thee? Not the beauty of bodies, nor the fair harmony of time, nor the brightness of the  light, so glads into our eyes, nor sweet melodies of varied songs, nor the fragrance, smell of flowers. Not limbs acceptable to the embracements of the flesh. None of these things I love when I love my God.

But and yet I love a kind of light melody, fragrance, meet an embracement when I love my God. But they are those which space cannot contain, which time cannot bear away. They are smells that  breathing cannot disperse. They are taste that eating cannot diminish. This is what I love when I  love my God.

And that's the final way to get the calm, to get the tranquility, to get the peace. It's to love him supremely. Now, finally, I told you character of peace, the three disciplines of  peace, but the secret, Paul talks about the secret. And this is why we're not done yet. And here's why  we're not done yet.

Try to go home and love the immutable. Just go ahead. And then tell me,  you know, write a paper and tell me how it went. I mean, just go home and sit down, find a nice quiet  place, sit down, and then try. Go.

Just try to love the immutable. And then I'm not feeling  anything yet. See, God is just a term. God is just, he's an abstraction, frankly. The word God is  just an abstraction.

But notice what it says, the secret of the peace of heart of God, or maybe I should  say the peace of God keeps your hearts and your minds, not just in God, but in Christ Jesus. And by the way, hearts and minds have separated there grammatically because Paul's trying to say,  it's one thing to keep your thoughts in Christ Jesus. We already talked about this. It's another  thing to put your heart in him, to have your heart in Christ Jesus. How does it work?

To find  him attractive, to find him lovely, to find him unbelievably lovely. See, it's not enough. It  says, Paul says, I want you to find Jesus Christ lovely. That's the only way you're ever going to  love the immutable and find that trend of quality. Well, how do you do that?

Think like this. There's  a place, actually, we read this. It was in a passage we looked at earlier this year, but we didn't  look at the verse. It's in Isaiah 57. Remember, when we're going through Isaiah?

Isaiah 57,  near the, at the end of the chapter says this, the wicked are like the tossing sea,  which cannot rest whose waves cast up myron mud. There is no peace, says my God, for the wicked. The wicked are like the tossing sea, which cannot rest whose waves cast up myron mud. There is no peace, says my God, for the wicked. Now, at first sight, this just looks like another one  of these Old Testament statements, God will smite the evil doers, but no, look, this is talking about  natural consequences.

And the stomachs had it right, and Augustin had it right. If you love anything  more than God, I don't just mean it's important to believe in God, of course, you have to believe in  God, but if you love anything more than God, if you live for anything more than God, your life  is going to be like a tossing sea, restless, constantly casting up myron mud,  because your life is like a house built on sand instead of on the rock, and you're always  going to be having cave-ins. We've been through it. If you love anything, you're going to  always be an anxiety about it. Anything more than God.

And so God is saying the natural consequence  of turning away from me, the natural consequence of not building your whole life,  centering your whole life on me, is restlessness, deep restlessness. Who took those consequences? You know, in 2 Corinthians 521, we always, that I always  quote, God made Jesus sin, who knew no sin, that we might become the righteous of God and him,  and how I always try to point out that doesn't mean that God made Jesus sinful. It means on the  cross he treated him as the sinners deserve. And what does this mean?

On the cross, he got all the  consequences of what we have done. And this is one of them. And can't you see it? Do you see Jesus Christ just walking through the crucifixion saying, I'm just keeping my mind  centered on God? I'm okay.

I'm content in whatever circumstance I'm in. Jesus didn't say that. No,  because he wasn't. Why? Because he lost all of his peace.

He cries, my God, my God,  why hast thou forsaken me? In fact, we're told that he died with a cry. He died screaming. Bill Lane, the commentator on the book of Mark, says, he says, the cry of dereliction. That  screaming says crucified criminals ordinarily suffered complete exhaustion.

And for long periods were  unconscious before they died. The stark realism of Mark's account describes a sudden violent death. The cry of dereliction expresses unfathomable pain. Jesus lost all of his peace. All of his peace.

So you could have eternal peace. And looking at that is what we'll get you  through. That's what we'll make him lovely. And let me prove it to you. We've got a case right  in front of you.

Horatio Spafford was an American lawyer who lost everything he had in the Chicago  Fire of 1871. Only two years later, he sent his wife Anna and their four daughters on a ship  across the Atlantic Ocean to England for a trip. The ship hit another ship on the way and began to  sink. As was sinking, Anna got the four little girls together and they prayed. And then the ship  went under the water and they all were scattered into the waves.

And all four good little girls  drowned. Anna was found unconscious by a rescue ship floating. They rescued her. They took her to England  and she cabled Horatio Spafford just two words, saved alone. And when Horatio Spafford was on the ship  over to England to bring his wife home, he began to write a hymn that we're going to sing at the end.

Is well with my soul, peace like a river. He wrote that. And here's what I want you to think. Why would a  man dealing with his grief, seeking the peace of God, the peace like a river, spent the entire  thing on Jesus? My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought, my sin, not in part, but the whole,  is nailed to the cross.

And I bear it no more. Praise the Lord, praise the Lord on my soul. What is  that got to do with his four little girls that are dead? Everything. You know why?

Look, when things  go wrong, one of the ways you lose your peace as you say, maybe I'm being punished, but no,  look at the cross. All the punishment fell on him. Another thing you say is, well, maybe God  doesn't care, maybe doesn't care. And no, look what he did for us. Look what he bore for us.

The Bible gives you a God that says, I've lost the child too, but not involuntarily, voluntarily for  your sake. You sing that hymn and you watch a man thinking, thanking and loving himself into  the peace of God. It worked for him under those circumstances. It worked for Paul under his  circumstances. It worked for you.

Let's pray. Thank you, Father, for giving us this offer, peace,  like a river, peace and fallible. We see, Lord, that peace is not something that really does just come  it's not a talent and it's really not even just a simple gift. It's a discipline. We have a number  of beliefs that we're not thinking into.

We have a wonderful God that we're not loving  and therefore we don't have the peace we ought to have. Give us this peace because we know the secret  how we can be thankful for even the bad things in our lives. It's the cross. How we can know that  God is with us no matter what it's the cross and we pray that you would help us knowing the gospel  of Jesus Christ. Think and thank and love you into the peace of God.

It's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today as Tim Keller explores one of the fruit of the Spirit. The Scripture this morning is from Paul's letter to the Philippians chapter 4 verses 4 through 12. Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again. Rejoice.

Let the gentleness of your be evident to all. The Lord is near, do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petition with  thanksgiving present your requests to God. And the peace of God which transcends all understanding will  guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Finally, brothers, whatever is true  whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable. If anything is excellent or praiseworthy, think about such things.

Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me or seen in me, put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you. I rejoice greatly in the Lord that at last you have  renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you have been concerned but you had no opportunity to show it. I am not saying this because I am in need.

For I have learned to be content, whatever the  circumstances. I know what it is to be in need and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation whether well fed or hungry,  whether living in plenty or in want. This is the word of the Lord. The premise of the Bible is that there is a difference between a morally restrained heart  and a supernaturally changed heart.

There is a difference between controlling, suppressing  the natural self-centeredness and insecurity of the heart through willpower  and seeing it permanently changed through the power of the Holy Spirit. In the book of Galatians, chapter 5, there is a list of the traits,  characteristics of a supernaturally changed heart. They are called the fruit of the Spirit. Love, joy, peace, patience. It is a classic list.

And each week we are taking one of those  traits and taking a passage, the scripture that describes it and trying to come to understand  how we can have more of that supernaturally changed heart in our own lives. Today,  we look at peace. Peace. And we are going to learn three things from this classic passage. The character of peace, the disciplines, the three disciplines of getting peace, and the secret.

Paul uses that word, the secret of peace. The character of peace, the disciplines of peace,  and the secret of peace. Now, the opposite of joy is sadness or despair, grief. But the opposite of peace is anxiety, fear, and debilitating worry. So you see here in verse 6,  it says, don't be anxious about anything, and the antidote is the peace of God.

By the way,  this word anxious is not the normal, it's not normal care and concern. If you love somebody,  if you love something, if you love anything, you have the burden of love and concern that comes  with that automatically. But this is a word that actually means to be torn up, to be torn into pieces  by debilitating worry and fear. So what is this piece of God? Two things, just to start.

Two things that Paul tells us about it. First, it's an inner calm and equilibrium. Because here down at the bottom, in verse 11 and 12, he says, I've learned how to be content  in whatever circumstance. I've learned the secret of being content in every situation,  which is to say, I'm the same in one situation as the other. That's poise, equilibrium,  an inner calm.

And for a second, let's think about his circumstances. See you and I, here in New York, we spend money in order to get poise. He's spent money on pills,  he's spent money on therapy, he's spent money on, and these things, you know, are things that  might maybe we need. But we're trying to get up the poise, the equipoise to face what,  you know, our bills, competition, the boss, our date, our lack of dates. One of the, what you're  doing is, these are the things that we're, that we're nervous about and we're anxious about  and we're really working at it.

And Paul is facing torture and death. He's in prison. And he's  saying, I've learned the secret of being able to smile at that. And look carefully, does Paul say,  you know why I can smile on the face of torture and death because I'm just that kind of guy. I'm a tough cookie.

No. See that's, that's talent. See talent is something that you were born with. There you've got it. I'm just one of those guys.

He doesn't say that. I've learned this. He said,  I've learned it. What does that mean? It's not natural to me, in fact.

It's not natural to you either. I've learned it. This calm so that I've got this equilibrium in any situation. But that's not  the only thing. The second thing Paul tells us about the character of this piece.

It's not just  an absence of fear. It's the presence of something. In particular, it's a sense of being protected. Because that doesn't come out as well in English as it should. It says in verse seven,  the peace of God will guard your hearts and your minds.

The word guard is a military word. It's a very  vivid word. It means to take a bunch of soldiers to take an army and surround a city with the army  to protect it from invasion. So if you have an army out there, you sleep really well. You know,  there's a whole army out there.

I don't have to worry about marauders or anybody. You know,  I go to sleep at night. And this is getting at something very important. And we'll see this in a  minute. Both in the ancient times and in modern times.

When people try to give advice on how to  become. They almost always talk about removing certain thoughts. Don't think about that. Don't think  that. Don't think those negative thoughts.

Stop thinking about that. Stop thinking about that. Control your thoughts. You know, expel the negative thoughts. That's how you get calm.

But here we see the peace of God is not the absence of some thoughts. It's the presence  of God himself. The God of peace will be with you. Christian peace is not  expelling negative thoughts. The problem with expelling negative thoughts is what you're really  doing there is you're just refusing to face how bad things are.

You know, you're not being  realistic. Okay, I'm going to get calm by not facing the facts. Essentially, Christian peace  is not that you stop facing the facts, but you get something in your life, a living power that  comes into your life that enables you to triumph over those facts, lifts you up over and through them. And it's a sense of being protected. And, you know, I, you, lots of us have experienced, I think,  lots of believers have experienced this peace of God.

But in the situations that I have been present  as a pastor usually, where I've seen people experience this peace of God that passes, that transcends  understanding, that goes beyond anything we can really account for. I've seen some people in  horrible situations, tragic situations, in some cases, having faced some violent death of a loved  one. Unlooked for. That's just the worst kind of situation to be in. And ordinarily, when you're  cruising along in life and suddenly somebody who you love is just ripped out of your life, violent.

At that time, you feel unprotected. You feel vulnerable. You feel like exposed. You feel like  you feel ravaged. And yet, sometimes I've seen Christians experience exactly the opposite.

They feel, during times like that, protected, like everything. Somehow, they have a sense that  God is with them and everything is going to be okay. They feel protected. They know exactly how bad  things are, but they've got something that enables them to triumph over it. If you've ever been on a  coast and seen in a storm and seen the waves come in and hit the rocks, sometimes the waves are  so huge that it covers some rock you might be watching.

And you say, that's the end of that rock. No way that rock's going to be there. And when the waves receive, it's received there it is. Hasn't budged an inch. And Paul is like that.

If you read his life, wave after wave,  he's beaten, he's stoned, he's flawed, he's shipwrecked. They're after him. They're trying to kill  him. He's betrayed. Wave after wave after wave.

And it's a plain historical fact. He's right. When he  said, I have found a way to be completely poised under any circumstances. He's the rock. All the waves  of life could not break him.

And he says, this isn't a natural talent. You can learn this. So that's the character of Christian peace. It's an inner calm and an equal living that comes from  that, but also a sense of God's presence and almost a reason transcending sense of his protection. Number one, number two, what then are the disciplines by which you can develop this piece?

Because actually, Paul's giving lots of advice in here, lots of advice on how you can develop this  piece and have this piece of God too. And there's three disciplines. And I'll name them  thinking, thanking and loving. I know the third one should be a TH, but I couldn't figure it out. Thinking, thanking and loving.

Thinking. Notice verse eight. He says,  brethren, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure. Think on these  things and the God of peace will be with you. So the first thing is thinking.

And this is really  important. Really important. Let's take a look at the first three of this long list. Think about  whatever is true, noble, right. Now that sounds pretty general, generic, doesn't it?

Whatever is  true, noble, right? But when Paul, this is Paul. And when Paul uses these words, these particular  Greek words in the Pauline corpus and his writings, he's talking about doctrine. He's talking about  the teaching of the Bible about God, about sin, and about Christ, and about salvation, and about  the world and human nature and God's plans for the world and the plan of salvation. That's what he's  talking about.

And this is amazing. He's saying, if you want peace, think about doctrine. Think  about what you know, about life and about God and about, and this is so completely different  than what you're going to find if you walk into a Barnes and Noble Reborder's bookstore and you go  to the place on anxiety, worry, stress, dealing with stress, how to relax. And you get out of book,  and here's what the woman never do. Never.

None of these books will ever say, so you're stressed,  your own hat, anxious. Let's start by asking the big questions. What is the meaning of life? What are you really here for? What's your life all about?

Where have you come from and where are  you going? I mean, what should human beings spend their time doing? Never. You think that's  going to relieve stress to a modern New Yorker? Of course not.

Why? Here's why they go right to  technique. They never ask you to think. They never say, let's think about the big questions,  you know, what's they fall about? Let's put things in perspective.

Never. They go to techniques. They go to relaxation techniques. They go to work, rest balance. For example, they'll say,  look, a couple times, every quarter, go somewhere, sit on a beach, look at the surf, and just  bracket out and stop worrying about thinking about everything else.

Just, or they'll give you  thought control techniques about dealing with negative thoughts, the negative emotions,  guilt thoughts, and so forth. They will never tell you to think. They'll tell you to actually  they go right to technique. Here's why. Let me read you two.

You don't want to worry, I'm going  for a second, but let me read you two interesting quotes. Here's Charles Darwin. And Charles Darwin  said quote, a person who has no assured belief in the existence of a personal God  and no belief in a future existence with retribution or reward. Such a person can have for his  rule of life as far as I see, only to follow whatever impulses and instincts are the strongest  or whatever seems to him to be the best ones. Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.

You know, great Supreme Court justice. Quite a formidable intellectual in the early 20th century. And one of his personal correspondents, he once wrote this to a friend. He says, there is no reason  for attributing to a man a significance different in kind from that which belongs to a baboon  or a grain of sand. The world has produced me and the reddle snake, but I will kill it if I get  the chance.

And the only reason is because it is incongruous to the world I want. The world  everyone is trying to make according to one's own power. Now, by the way, Oliver Wendell Holmes  got a lot of heat for this. He's a Supreme Court justice. And he says, you know, there is no rational  reason to say that human being is really more valuable, more significant than an animal or a rock.

Oh my gosh, people have gone, but you know what, his biographers have said, you know, he's just  working out the implications. If you don't believe in God, this is what Darwin is saying. I think you don't believe in God. And you believe you're here by accident. And when you die, you rot,  that's it.

And when the sun dies, everything goes away. And therefore, nothing that human beings have  ever tried to accomplish will mount anything. Okay, what are the implications of that? One of them  is there is no right and wrong. You may feel there's right and wrong.

Darwin says, you may have a  feeling, but your feeling shouldn't trump anybody else's. You can feel it, but there is no right and wrong. There's really no way to tell people how they ought to live. Holmes is right. Ultimately, what a  human being is is just we've we're the product of these forces and we're going to go away someday  and what's to say that, you know, it may feel more significant than an animal or a rock, but you're  not.

And what the biographers said was Holmes was simply thinking out the implications of not  believing there's a God or there's a purpose in life. Well, I know plenty of New Yorkers that have  the same beliefs. Lots of the same people have the same beliefs. That is, they have the same beliefs. They don't think there's a God.

They think things are here by accident. But they would say to think  about it like that to work out the implications is morbid. Okay, look, fine. That's fine to say,  let's not think out the implications is morbid, but I want you to see what you're doing. You're getting your peace by not thinking out the implications of your beliefs,  whereas Paul is saying Christian peace is exactly the opposite.

Christian peace comes from  thinking out the implications, thinking. See, what are the true and the right? What's the Christian  doctrine? God, there's a God and He made us for fellowship with Him and He created a perfect world,  you know, a perfect world in which there's no sorrow or disease or death originally. And He wanted  to live with us in it and of course it's gone all wrong and we've turned from Him and the world  is broken but He's sent His Son into the world to rescue us and He's preparing a new heavens and  new earth.

We're going to live with Him forever. Look at your value, look at the fact that the future  is secure now. What does that mean? If you're a Christian today and you believe all that doctrine  and you're not at peace, you're not thinking. Isn't that something?

You're not thinking. See, there's a stupid piece and then there's a smart piece. Let me tell you the stupid piece. Stupid pieces. Ho, ho, ho, to the bottle I go, to heal my heart and drown my woe.

Now what's that? A couple, I'm going to pop a cork. I'm going to sit under a tree. I'm going to look at the  surface. I'm not going to think I'm going to bracket out.

See, if I think about all the things that  are going wrong in life and in the world, I'm just going to bracket it. I'm not going to think  as much. But the Paul is saying, if you're a Christian, you don't bracket out. You bracket in. You think big, big picture.

Everything's going to be okay. You know, if you really believe just the  basic Christian truth and you think it and think it and think about it, you're going to get peace. And if you don't have peace, you're not thinking. There's stupid piece and there's smart piece  and Christian's piece is not by making yourself stupid. It's by making yourself as aware of your  beliefs as thoughtful as possible.

That's only number one. Because if you first learn the  discipline of thinking, then secondly, there's the discipline of thinking. Because see how very  important that is in verse six. Paul says, don't be anxious. Okay, don't be anxious.

Fine. Well,  then what should we be doing? But make requests to God with thanksgiving. So thanksgiving is put  against anxiety. But look carefully here.

It's a little counterintuitive, isn't it? See, what we  would say is you make your request to God and then you get your request and if you get your requests,  you think. I don't know what it says. It says you thank him as you make the request. Well, why should I thank him?

As I'm making the request, John, I want to wait until I see what he's  going to do. No. Paul says you're never going to be content unless you make your request. That  means you acknowledge that life is in his hands and you thank him for whatever he's going to do. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God.

Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to  face every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365 day devotional, the songs of Jesus,  you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a  regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start. And if you already spend time  in study and prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest  emotions and questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with him. We'll send you  Tim and Kathy Keller's devotional is our thanks for your gift to help Gospel and Life share the  love of Jesus with more people.

Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash give. That's  gospelandlife.com slash give. You're never going to get contentment unless you see this. Now this is a heading. You might say  subheading, underthinking.

That's why I put it thinking, then thanking. But now listen,  we already talked about this. God did not make the world to be a world filled with sorrow and death  and violence and suffering. But he's got a plan. He's got a plan to renew it.

He's got a plan to  get it back. And the plan is put in the abstract in Romans 8, 28, where it says,  if you love God, God is working everything together for good in your life. Absolutely,  everything, even the bad things, even the things that he hates, the things that he didn't put  into this world. He is going to weave into a plan, a tapestry. He's going to put everything  together and he's going to weave it all together for your good and his glory.

That's an abstraction. Here's the concrete. On the day that Jesus Christ was crucified, all of his friends  would have looked up and said, I can't believe this. The good he was doing, the people he was healing,  the people's lies he was changing. I can't believe this happened.

I can't believe  that these charges were trumped up. I can't believe they're doing this. And you would have said,  I can't believe the God could bring anything good out of this. You would have gone home,  senders. Absolutely no way.

God could bring anything good out of this. And you were looking  straight at the greatest thing God has ever done toward the redemption of the world. But you  couldn't get it into your little brain at the moment as to how that could possibly be. And God  is saying that is just the prime example of what I'm doing in everybody's life. Even the terrible  things that are happening to you, I'm working out for good.

I'm only saying this because I'm like  a little rat and when I push down a bar and I get food, I push it again. So I'll tell you this story  again because you always like it. The most vivid example of this for me was when in my early 20s  I prayed for a year, oh, there's a girl that I wanted to date and she was breaking up with me. I was a girl. I was thinking of marrying and she wanted to break up with me.

I was all week,  all year. I said, Lord, don't let her break up with me. Of course, it was the wrong girl. Wasn't the one sitting out here looking at me with a grin on her face right now. But I actually helped God.

I mean, I actually did what I could to help God with the prayer  because she was that one summer near the very end of the relationship. She was working at a  a poke, you know, a resort for the summer in a poke, and I got a job as a short order cook at  the same resort. I was saying, Lord, I'm making this as easy as possible for you. You know,  I've asked for this prayer and I'm just, you know, I'm taking the distance down everything. But I look back at it.

God was saying, my son, when a child of mine makes a request. I always give that person what he or she would have asked for if they knew everything I know. Do you believe that? To the degree you believe that, you're going to have peace. And if you don't believe it, you don't have peace.

And whose fault is that? Is it God's? See, make your request known with Thanksgiving. So there's thinking,  that's the first discipline. And if you do that, then thinking is the second discipline,  but loving, loving is the last one.

And where do we get that? Well,  notice Paul doesn't just say, think on what is true, what is noble, what is right. And by the way,  you know what it says, think about such things? That is, the Greek word there means to drill down. It means to ponder.

It means to not over chew, over meditate. It doesn't just mean think about. It just means, it just means, you know, just continually pound these things into your head. But see, the first three have more to do with the mind. Whatever is true, whatever is noble,  whatever is right.

But then look, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable, whatever is excellent. This is attraction. This is love. He says, not enough just to think on the right things. It's also  important to love the right thing.

And here we have to go to St. Augustine. St. Augustine,  great Christian thinker, lived in the third and fourth century. He was completely aware,  profoundly aware of the problem in Greek philosophy.

And it had been for years. In fact,  Paul's referring to it. The great problem is, how can you live a life of contentment? And the Greek word for that was adorakia. And that's the very word Paul uses twice in 11 and 12.

He says, I've learned. I've got the adorakia. It means to be independent of circumstances. It means to have this poise. It means to have this power.

And not to be upset, devastated,  you know, melted down, freaking out over anything. Always poised. And of course, as you might guess,  the philosophers that really worked that out were the Stoics. And what the Stoics taught was,  the reason why most people are not able to live, contented, you know, lies of equilibrium,  is that they love the wrong things. You should never love success.

If you set your heart on success,  even if you get successful, you'll always be anxious. You'll never have peace because you'll be  afraid of losing it. And of course, if you don't get it, you'll even be worse. And you shouldn't  set your heart primarily on family. Because even if you get a good family, you'll always be worried  about it.

You'll always be anxious, you see, for something to go wrong with the family. And if  the something goes wrong with the family, you know, you'll be devastated. So the philosophers were  saying, here's the problem. You're loving things that you're not in control of. And therefore,  they said, don't you dare give your heart to anything but your own virtue.

That's what the  philosopher said. That's what's certain with the Stoics said. Most of them. Because the virtue is  something you can control. You can't control success.

It has so much to do with circumstances. You can't control your family. Things can go wrong with your family. You can't control this,  you can't control that. So don't set your heart on anything you can't control.

That's what they  said. And then you will know tranquility. Set your heart only on your own virtue. You can be courageous,  you can be have integrity, you can be honest. Set your heart only on the only thing that should  really truly make you content is to know that you are being the person you want to be.

That's  under your control. Nothing else is. And Saint Augustine said, you guys have completely missed the  boat. If you think that your virtue is under your control, it is not. Listen, if you say,  the thing I'm going to live for is success.

And you've set off, yeah, it's not certain you're going  to have success. But if you say the thing that matters to me is that I be the person I want to be,  to live according to my principles, you know, living according to my virtues. He says,  that's every bit is uncertain. You don't have control over that. You're human being.

You're frail. And if you fail, then you've got nothing. Augustine says, you got it wrong. You shouldn't be loving  things out there and you shouldn't be loving anything in here. And then he said, only love of the  immutable can bring tranquility.

Only love of the immutable. What's the immutable? That which cannot  change. Your virtue can change. Don't give me this stuff about control.

He says, your problem is  that our problem, the reason we don't have pieces, we're loving mutable things, things that  circumstances, including our virtue can take away from us. But there's one thing that's immutable  that not only can circumstances not take it away from you, but even the worst circumstances in  this life only give you more of it. Have you thought about that? What's the worst circumstances? Violent death.

And there's one thing that if you love it supremely, even violent death gives you  more of it. What is it? The presence of God, the beauty of God, the face of God. And that's the  reason why Augustine could say this and it was just amazing. In his confessions, he lays it out.

First of all, he says this. In confessions, this is book four. He says, God alone is the place  of peace that cannot be disturbed. And God will not withhold Himself from your love unless you  withhold your love from Him. See, there it is.

If you love the immutable, you'll have tranquility. So how can you not love the immutable only if you withhold your love from Him? But if you don't withhold your love from Him, you will not withhold His love from you. And you might say, and at some point, Augustine being a great writer was hearing an objection. And the objection goes like this.

The objection says, well, no, wait a minute. You're saying I have to love God, but I love a lot of things. I love material comforts. I love  people. I love romance.

I love, you know, there's lots of things. I have to love God not these things. And he says, no, no, no. But you have to say that if you love God supremely, you not only get God  the immutable, but you will find that all that what you have been loving in these things  was actually in God. He puts it like this.

He's praying. Augustine writes, quote, what do I love  when I love thee? Not the beauty of bodies, nor the fair harmony of time, nor the brightness of the  light, so glads into our eyes, nor sweet melodies of varied songs, nor the fragrance, smell of flowers. Not limbs acceptable to the embracements of the flesh. None of these things I love when I love my God.

But and yet I love a kind of light melody, fragrance, meet an embracement when I love my God. But they are those which space cannot contain, which time cannot bear away. They are smells that  breathing cannot disperse. They are taste that eating cannot diminish. This is what I love when I  love my God.

And that's the final way to get the calm, to get the tranquility, to get the peace. It's to love him supremely. Now, finally, I told you character of peace, the three disciplines of  peace, but the secret, Paul talks about the secret. And this is why we're not done yet. And here's why  we're not done yet.

Try to go home and love the immutable. Just go ahead. And then tell me,  you know, write a paper and tell me how it went. I mean, just go home and sit down, find a nice quiet  place, sit down, and then try. Go.

Just try to love the immutable. And then I'm not feeling  anything yet. See, God is just a term. God is just, he's an abstraction, frankly. The word God is  just an abstraction.

But notice what it says, the secret of the peace of heart of God, or maybe I should  say the peace of God keeps your hearts and your minds, not just in God, but in Christ Jesus. And by the way, hearts and minds have separated there grammatically because Paul's trying to say,  it's one thing to keep your thoughts in Christ Jesus. We already talked about this. It's another  thing to put your heart in him, to have your heart in Christ Jesus. How does it work?

To find  him attractive, to find him lovely, to find him unbelievably lovely. See, it's not enough. It  says, Paul says, I want you to find Jesus Christ lovely. That's the only way you're ever going to  love the immutable and find that trend of quality. Well, how do you do that?

Think like this. There's  a place, actually, we read this. It was in a passage we looked at earlier this year, but we didn't  look at the verse. It's in Isaiah 57. Remember, when we're going through Isaiah?

Isaiah 57,  near the, at the end of the chapter says this, the wicked are like the tossing sea,  which cannot rest whose waves cast up myron mud. There is no peace, says my God, for the wicked. The wicked are like the tossing sea, which cannot rest whose waves cast up myron mud. There is no peace, says my God, for the wicked. Now, at first sight, this just looks like another one  of these Old Testament statements, God will smite the evil doers, but no, look, this is talking about  natural consequences.

And the stomachs had it right, and Augustin had it right. If you love anything  more than God, I don't just mean it's important to believe in God, of course, you have to believe in  God, but if you love anything more than God, if you live for anything more than God, your life  is going to be like a tossing sea, restless, constantly casting up myron mud,  because your life is like a house built on sand instead of on the rock, and you're always  going to be having cave-ins. We've been through it. If you love anything, you're going to  always be an anxiety about it. Anything more than God.

And so God is saying the natural consequence  of turning away from me, the natural consequence of not building your whole life,  centering your whole life on me, is restlessness, deep restlessness. Who took those consequences? You know, in 2 Corinthians 521, we always, that I always  quote, God made Jesus sin, who knew no sin, that we might become the righteous of God and him,  and how I always try to point out that doesn't mean that God made Jesus sinful. It means on the  cross he treated him as the sinners deserve. And what does this mean?

On the cross, he got all the  consequences of what we have done. And this is one of them. And can't you see it? Do you see Jesus Christ just walking through the crucifixion saying, I'm just keeping my mind  centered on God? I'm okay.

I'm content in whatever circumstance I'm in. Jesus didn't say that. No,  because he wasn't. Why? Because he lost all of his peace.

He cries, my God, my God,  why hast thou forsaken me? In fact, we're told that he died with a cry. He died screaming. Bill Lane, the commentator on the book of Mark, says, he says, the cry of dereliction. That  screaming says crucified criminals ordinarily suffered complete exhaustion.

And for long periods were  unconscious before they died. The stark realism of Mark's account describes a sudden violent death. The cry of dereliction expresses unfathomable pain. Jesus lost all of his peace. All of his peace.

So you could have eternal peace. And looking at that is what we'll get you  through. That's what we'll make him lovely. And let me prove it to you. We've got a case right  in front of you.

Horatio Spafford was an American lawyer who lost everything he had in the Chicago  Fire of 1871. Only two years later, he sent his wife Anna and their four daughters on a ship  across the Atlantic Ocean to England for a trip. The ship hit another ship on the way and began to  sink. As was sinking, Anna got the four little girls together and they prayed. And then the ship  went under the water and they all were scattered into the waves.

And all four good little girls  drowned. Anna was found unconscious by a rescue ship floating. They rescued her. They took her to England  and she cabled Horatio Spafford just two words, saved alone. And when Horatio Spafford was on the ship  over to England to bring his wife home, he began to write a hymn that we're going to sing at the end.

Is well with my soul, peace like a river. He wrote that. And here's what I want you to think. Why would a  man dealing with his grief, seeking the peace of God, the peace like a river, spent the entire  thing on Jesus? My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought, my sin, not in part, but the whole,  is nailed to the cross.

And I bear it no more. Praise the Lord, praise the Lord on my soul. What is  that got to do with his four little girls that are dead? Everything. You know why?

Look, when things  go wrong, one of the ways you lose your peace as you say, maybe I'm being punished, but no,  look at the cross. All the punishment fell on him. Another thing you say is, well, maybe God  doesn't care, maybe doesn't care. And no, look what he did for us. Look what he bore for us.

The Bible gives you a God that says, I've lost the child too, but not involuntarily, voluntarily for  your sake. You sing that hymn and you watch a man thinking, thanking and loving himself into  the peace of God. It worked for him under those circumstances. It worked for Paul under his  circumstances. It worked for you.

Let's pray. Thank you, Father, for giving us this offer, peace,  like a river, peace and fallible. We see, Lord, that peace is not something that really does just come  it's not a talent and it's really not even just a simple gift. It's a discipline. We have a number  of beliefs that we're not thinking into.

We have a wonderful God that we're not loving  and therefore we don't have the peace we ought to have. Give us this peace because we know the secret  how we can be thankful for even the bad things in our lives. It's the cross. How we can know that  God is with us no matter what it's the cross and we pray that you would help us knowing the gospel  of Jesus Christ. Think and thank and love you into the peace of God.

It's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

### 引言：外在自制与内在转变的区别

圣经告诉我们，外在的自制与只有圣灵才能带来的深刻持久的改变之间是有区别的。在加拉太书5章中，保罗称这些内在的转变为圣灵的果子。爱、喜乐、平安、忍耐等等。今天，蒂姆·凯勒将探讨圣灵的果子之一。今天的经文来自保罗写给腓立比人的信，第四章第4到12节。

> "你们要靠主常常喜乐。我再说，你们要喜乐。要让众人看出你们的谦和。主已经近了。应当一无挂虑，只要凡事借着祷告、祈求和感谢，将你们所要的告诉神。神所赐出人意外的平安，必在基督耶稣里保守你们的心怀意念。"

**圣经的前提是，道德上被约束的心与超自然改变的心之间是有区别的。**

### 平安的特质

喜乐的反面是悲伤或绝望、悲痛。但平安的反面是焦虑、恐惧和令人衰弱的担忧。所以你在第6节看到，它说，不要为任何事焦虑，解药是神的平安。

> "神所赐的平安必保守你们的心怀意念。"

**基督徒的平安不是排除负面思想。**

### 平安的操练：思考、感恩与爱

#### 1. 思考

保罗说，"凡是真实的、可敬的、公义的、纯洁的、可爱的、有美名的，若有什么德行，若有什么称赞，这些事你们都要思念。"

- 思考教义。
- 思考你对生命和神的认识。

#### 2. 感恩

保罗说，"以感谢的心向神祈求。"

- 在祈求时感谢祂。
- 承认生命在祂的掌握中。

#### 3. 爱

保罗说，"凡是可爱的、可称赞的、卓越的。"

- 爱正确的事物。
- 对不变者的爱可以带来宁静。

### 平安的奥秘

保罗谈到平安的奥秘。**神的平安保守你们的心怀意念在基督耶稣里。**

- 耶稣失去了祂所有的平安，以便你可以拥有永恒的平安。
- 看着这一点会让祂变得可爱。

> "霍雷肖·斯帕福德写了一首赞美诗，处理他的悲伤，寻求神的平安。"

让我们祷告。

感谢天父，赐给我们这份平安的邀请，像河流般的平安，无法动摇的平安。我们看到，主啊，平安不是简单地到来的；它不是一种天赋，甚至也不是一种简单的礼物。它是一种操练。我们有许多信仰没有深入思考。我们有一位奇妙的神，我们没有去爱，因此我们没有我们应有的平安。赐给我们这平安，因为我们知道这个奥秘，如何在我们生活中的坏事中也能感恩。这就是十字架。我们如何知道无论如何神与我们同在，这就是十字架。我们祈求您帮助我们，认识耶稣基督的福音。思考、感恩和爱您进入神的平安。奉耶稣的名祷告。阿门。
