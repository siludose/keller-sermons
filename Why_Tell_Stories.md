### Introduction: The Struggle for Meaning in Work

Are you struggling to find meaning and purpose in your work? We spend much of our lives at our jobs, but our work can often be the area where we feel the most frustration and futility in our lives. Today on the podcast, Tim Keller helps us understand how the Gospel frees us to have hope and joy in our vocations.

### The Power of Stories

This is a sermon with a nice climax moving on. This is a string of random thoughts. It's possible you get more out of the questions and answers afterwards than whatever I tell you about now, but I think you need to know if you're Christian, what is the rationale for being an actor? You know, why should Christians be actors? Why should Christians be actors? What do actors do of any worth from a Christian point of view? That's what I want to talk about.

> "If I could give it to you in a nutshell, I wouldn't have had to write the story."

**Actors are like Jesus making the word flesh.** They're taking a story which is invisible and making it visible.

### The Christian Master Story

What is the Christian master story? What do we think the world story is? What do we think the main problem is? Here's let me give it to you in a nutshell. Everything was created good, but everything has fallen through sin. Everything is broken through sin. And through Christ, everything's going to be redeemed.

### The Role of Actors

Actors are storytellers. They embody stories. People need stories, and stories are just about the best possible way to change people's worldview, change people's understanding of things.

### Challenges for Christian Actors

At this point, you've got to pretty much act in other people's stories. But if you ever get a chance to put your own together and act them out, what I find fascinating about evangelism...

> "You can't attach meaning to your own life unless you have a master storyline."

### Conclusion: Engaging with Culture

Ultimately, the gospel is God saved you through a story, not through a bunch of principles. God did not show up with a bunch of principles and said, if you do these things, you'll go to heaven. What happened was God comes in the world through Jesus Christ and saves you by what he did. He saves you through a story, a true story, of course, not through you're just being obedient and going to church and obeying.

> "Salvation is through a story. And the story is so comprehensive. It takes in all other stories and resolves them."

So I know it's a little bit mind-blowing and over. It's not exaggerated. I absolutely believe it, but on the other hand, I realize it's a lot to take in.

### 引言：在工作中寻找意义的挣扎

你是否在努力寻找工作中的意义和目的？我们大部分时间都在工作中度过，但工作往往是我们生活中感到最沮丧和无意义的领域。今天在播客中，Tim Keller 帮助我们理解福音如何让我们在职业中获得希望和喜悦。

### 故事的力量

这是一篇有着美好高潮的讲道。这是一串随机的想法。可能你从之后的问答中获得的比我现在告诉你的更多，但我认为你需要知道，如果你是基督徒，成为演员的理由是什么？你知道，为什么基督徒应该成为演员？为什么基督徒应该成为演员？从基督教的角度来看，演员有什么价值？这就是我想谈论的。

> “如果我能用一句话概括，我就不必写这个故事了。”

**演员就像耶稣使道成肉身。** 他们把一个看不见的故事变成可见的。

### 基督教的主线故事

基督教的主线故事是什么？我们认为世界的故事是什么？我们认为主要问题是什么？让我给你一个简要的概述。一切都是好的创造，但一切都因罪而堕落。一切都因罪而破碎。通过基督，一切都将被救赎。

### 演员的角色

演员是讲故事的人。他们体现故事。人们需要故事，而故事几乎是改变人们世界观、改变人们对事物理解的最佳方式。

### 基督徒演员的挑战

在这一点上，你几乎必须在别人的故事中表演。但如果你有机会自己编写并表演自己的故事，我发现关于传福音的事情很有趣...

> “除非你有一个主线故事，否则你无法为自己的人生赋予意义。”

### 结论：与文化的互动

最终，福音是上帝通过一个故事拯救了你，而不是通过一堆原则。上帝没有带着一堆原则出现并说，如果你做这些事情，你就会去天堂。发生的是，上帝通过耶稣基督进入世界，并通过他的所作所为拯救了你。他通过一个故事拯救了你，当然是一个真实的故事，而不是通过你只是顺从、去教堂和服从。

> “救赎是通过一个故事。这个故事是如此全面。它吸收了所有其他故事并解决了它们。”

所以我知道这有点令人震惊和过度。这并不夸张。我绝对相信这一点，但另一方面，我意识到这需要很多时间来消化。
