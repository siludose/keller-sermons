Today on the podcast, Tim Keller helps us  understand how the Gospel frees us to have hope and joy in our vocations. This is a sermon with a nice climax moving on. This is a string of random thoughts. It's  possible you get more out of the questions and answers afterwards than whatever I tell you about  now, but I think you need to know if you're Christian, what is the rationale for being an actor? You know, why should Christians be actors?

Why should Christians be actors? What do actors do of  any worth from a Christian point of view? That's what I want to talk about. So that's why I mean,  I have a series of random thoughts on that. But let me start by getting you something out of the  New York Times.

I was intrigued by the fact that Bill T. Jones, the dancer and choreographer,  etc, has a new piece that he's putting on based on Flannery O'Connor's, one of Flannery O'Connor's  short stories. Now what's interesting is here's Bill T. Jones. He says, this is his interview.

He says,  I'm angry as hell at the Bush administration. I'm not pleased with the fundamentalist  lineage in this country. And he's sort of ranting and raging as a sort of normal typical New York  secular liberal person. However, he was utterly entranced with Flannery O'Connor's short stories. And he comes right out and says, he's just overwhelmed.

He says, the best short stories. And he wanted to  put them on stage, at least one of them. And what's intriguing is, first of all, number one, the stories,  the one he used is incredibly overtly Christian. It's a story about a grandfather and a grandson  who are living alone in the hinterland of Georgia in the probably in the 30s or 40s. And the boy is just getting uppity.

So the grandfather says, I'm going to take him into  Atlanta because he wants to go to the big city. And he's really almost never seen running water. He's never seen almost anything. And he's not going to take him to the big city until you get your  fill of it. And then you'll see, you know, it's nothing special.

And he takes him in and unfortunately  the boy likes what he sees and he's getting more and more what he would consider uppity. And at one  point, the grandfather, when the boy's taking a nap, abandons him, just runs away from him, gets around  a corner just to show him, just to teach him a lesson. It's very mean-spirited. Also all during  the, obviously all during the story, the grandfather is showing, you know, tremendously realistic  but really venal racist attitudes, you know, everywhere. So he's, you don't like him at all.

And when he abandons his grandson and he scares the grandson, there's a terrible incident which  the boy just runs through the crowd just screaming, where is the grandfather,  knocks a woman over the police come, the police want to know who's boy is this and the grandfather  is so scared because he never deals with the police actually denies the boy, denies that he's the  boy's grandfather and walks away. And there's this horrible rift. And in the end, in a very enigmatic  and fascinating way, the boy forgives the grandfather. Now, Bill T. Jones, he comes right out and says,  this is fascinating to me.

And I'll reach at the end of it. He says, Flannery O'Connor is a non-ironic  Catholic believer. Now, and she is a very strong Christian Catholic believer. And here's what Bill  T. Jones said.

He says, she believes that there's this thing called grace and that grace sometimes hits  us right between the eyes when we are mostly based. Now she and I may disagree on this. He disagrees  with the basic idea. And while O'Connor seems to make all these connections that I may not agree on,  all I know is it's a tremendously powerful, overwhelmingly strong story and I wanted to put it  on stage. In fact, here's how it ends.

He just talked about how overtly Christian it is. The  grandfather's name is Mr. Head, by the way. It's that Mr. Head stood very still and felt the action  of mercy touch him because at the very end the boy forgives him and says, let's go home.

He says,  he felt the action of mercy touch him but this time he knew that there were no words in the world  that could name it. He understood that mercy grew out of agony, which is not denied to any man  and which is given in strange ways to children. He understood that it was all a man could carry into  death to give his maker and he suddenly burned with shame that he had so little of it to take with him. He stood appalled judging himself with the thoroughness of God while the action of mercy covered  his pride like a flame and consumed it. He had never thought himself a great sinner before but  he now saw that his true depravity had been hidden from him lest it caused him to spare.

He realized  that he was forgiven for sins from the beginning of time when he had conceived in his own heart the  sin of Adam until the present when he had denied poor Nelson, that's his grandson. He saw that  Nelson was too monstrous for him to claim his own and since God loved in proportion as he  forgave, he felt ready at that instant to enter paradise. Bilti Jones is putting this on. Now why  it's a tremendously well told story. It's not an essay which he could have easily written  on why there is a God and we are sinful and God does forgive us in proportion to our  our sin and only if we understand where sinners can we turn and get the mercy and therefore the  worst we know ourselves to be the more mercy we get.

In other words, he could have written that essay  and Bilti Jones wouldn't even have read it. It wouldn't even have turned it over but it's a story. If somebody at one point asked Flierry O'Connor, he said, I'm trying to understand this story  I read of years and it's wonderful. Could you give me a nutshell what it means? Just in a nutshell,  a sentence or two what it means.

You know what she said? Very famous. She said, if I could give it to  you in a nutshell, I wouldn't have had to write the story. If I could have told it to you in two  sentences, I wouldn't have had to write the story. Now, what are actors?

There's a difference between  writers and actors. His actors are like Jesus making the word flesh. They're taking a story  which is invisible and making it visible. You know, Jesus was the word made flesh. There was a word  but it was invisible and he embodied it.

Now what actors do is they tell stories but they don't  just tell stories. They embody stories. Of course, you really can't tell a story without acting  to some degree but you are embodying a story and people need stories and stories are just about  the best possible way to change people's worldview, change people's understanding of things and  that's what you do. Now let me back up and give you a couple random when I say random. They're not  totally random because they're kind of, they're sort of logical but some ideas about what stories are  and why they have the impact they have.

First of all, what's the story? You might find this odd. The best place I've ever read a definition of a story is in the Harvard Business Review. A two or three Hollywood screenwriters wrote an article because the Harvard Business Review was  saying it CEOs when they're trying to persuade people stupidly, use graphs and figures  and they just give you facts and figures. He says that's not what changes people's minds.

That's not  what motivates people. You need to tell a story. And they have no idea what about stories in  MBA school. So they said here's what a story is. Three things.

First of all, well, it's actually two  things in a way. Something knocks life off balance. You do not have a story unless something has knocked  life out of whack. So you know, the classic is Lillard Riding Hood took her grandmother goodies is a  principal. It's a fact.

You know, it's a graph. It's not a story. But Lillard Riding Hood  went to take her grandmother goodies, but the big bad wolf had eaten her grandmother and was waiting  for her in bed. That's a story. Something is, you know, knocked life out of whack.

Then because  something is knocked life out of whack, you have, and there's been a lot of ink spilled about this  for years now, you have protagonist and antagonist. A protagonist means a pro-agonizer. You're  agonizing for something. And the antagonist is the anti-agonizer. And the protagonist is trying  to get life back in balance.

And the antagonists are the people who are against you or the forces  that are against you that are trying to stop you from do that. You don't have a story unless you  have protagonist and antagonist. And when I said there's been a lot of ink spilled over the years  about this, I'm going to tell you in a minute that almost everybody from liberal to conservative  realizes that the reason stories are so powerful is that there's no way for a human being to  attach meaning to anything unless you put it into a storyline. And there's no such thing as a  storyline without something being knocked off balance, and some people struggling to put it back  in balance, and some people against them, right? You don't have a story unless you've got good  guys and bad guys, or at least of some sort.

And the reason people are pretty upset about that is  if you can't attach meaning to something without a story, and if story is got always  protagonists and antagonists, there's no way to attach meaning to anything without  basically dividing the world into good guys and bad guys. And every master story that helps  you organize reality has to have, quote, the other capital O. Somebody that we see is the bad guy. And that is one of the problems we have in the world right now. And you can ask me more about  if you want.

So a story is something knocks life off a balance. Protagonists try to get it back  in balance against the eye tag, and I guess the third thing you would say is the resolution of  the story is is the mission success or not. Stories don't have to have happy endings. You know, they can have ambiguous endings, they can have like no endings, which of course is  really cool and avant garde, you know, not to end it. But the point of the matter is even if that  you don't end the story, if you don't end it happily, you know the story should end, or you know  the story hasn't ended.

Because you know that stories have endings. And so maybe the story, maybe  the play, maybe the movie doesn't really tell you how it ends, but you know there should be an end. That's what a story is. Now, I already said this. That's the first thing.

That's what a story is. Secondly, I already alluded to this. You cannot attach meaning to anything unless you  put it in a storyline. Now my best examples of this, my favorite example, this is 9-11. There's a liberal storyline.

And the liberal storyline is America are the bad people in the world,  and the oppressed in the poor are the good. And there's a conservative storyline, which is America  are the good people. We believe in democracy and we're good people. And out there is all sorts of  totalitarianism and all sorts of, you know, low IQ and all sorts of other people. And so we're  the good guys and they're the bad guys as opposed to liberal.

And so what happened when 9-11 comes  along? What do they do? Some people said, you see, they hate us because we are so big and so bad. Conservative said, see, they hate us because we're so good. And now we have to do something about it.

In other words, what they immediately did was they said, what this means is we got to do a war  on terror. The liberal said what this means is we've got to, you know, admit what we're doing in  the world and how people hate us and so on. They took the incident and they couldn't make sense of  it unless they brought it into a storyline. Now the best storyline was actually Giuliani and  Pataki. And what they said was this tragedy can make us a stronger city.

If we pull together,  we can do it. We can do it. So what they did was they, you know, they put it in a different  storyline. But nobody could talk about it without putting it into a storyline. Nobody could just give  you facts.

You can't make sense of anything. You can't attach meaning to anything unless you put  it into a narrative. You watch newspapers, look at plays, everybody's got the assumption behind  every story is life ought to be in a certain way. Something has knocked it off balance. And these are  the people trying to put it into balance and these are the people who are against it.

Now first  of all, that means you can't attach meaning to your own life unless you have a master storyline. There's some people who say my master storyline is I am bringing myself out of very, very humble  roots and abusive background. And I'm going to make something of myself. That's their storyline. Other people, it's a quest for true love.

There's no doubt about it. That's their storyline. Other people, I'm a free spirit artist and I'm trying to make the world safe for free spirit artists  like me. And, you know, it's the oppressive, traditional people that really is why the world is  bad. Everybody's got a narrative by which they are saying, this is what my life means.

And, and this would be in the book, if any of you read that book that I'd recommend it to Luan. What that book says is everybody has a worldview, which is you can't operate without a kind of macro  story view of what the world story is. In other words, when you look out in the world,  obviously the world's not what it ought to be. Something is knocked the world off whack. Poverty isn't a good thing.

War isn't a good thing. Races isn't a good thing. You know,  psychological problems are a good thing. What is wrong with the world? And we'll put it right.

So, Marx had an idea. He kind of vilified, you know, the in a bourgeois and he vilified the,  you know, the owners of the means of production. And he said, basically, state control of economy  will make the difference. Freud had an approach. Everybody's got an approach.

Buddhist say,  the real problem is individual consciousness. You think you're an individual self and you don't  see your part of the old soul. See, Plato and the Greeks, they said the real problem is the material  world and the way it drags you down. Everybody says, this here is the villain. This is the antagonist.

This is what's wrong. And here's what you have to do to put it right. Everybody's got that. And they're called worldviews. No matter who you are, you can't live without one.

But a worldview is actually just a master narrative of what you think is wrong with the world,  who's on the right side to get it back, who's on the wrong side, who's against getting it back,  and what do we have to do? Now, what this means for Christians is this. The biggest problem,  of course, that actors have, unlike writers or maybe other kinds of artists, is generally speaking,  unless you, I guess some of you have done this, you're acting out. You're embodying stories  that somebody else has written. And you might say, was Christians, you say, I never act in a story  that I feel like is a great Christian story with a Christian message to it.

Well, I want you to  consider something for a second. What is the Christian master story? What do we think the world  story is? What do we think the main problem is? What do we think the master story is?

Here's  let me give it to you in a nutshell. Everything was created good, but everything has fallen  through sin. Everything is broken through sin. And through Christ, everything's going to be redeemed. Now, let me tell you what that means.

A Greek worldview says the body's bad. The spirit is good. The Buddhist worldview says the spirit is good, but material reality is an illusion. You know, Marx would actually say, you know, the capitalists are bad and the proletariat's good. The awful lot of conservatives would say it's the other way around.

You know, the proletariat,  the great unwashed, we have to watch out, you know, about, we have to be careful about them. You know, they don't know what's, you know, there's Hobbes as opposed to Locke. Everybody had,  everybody said, this is what's wrong with the world. The Christian story refuses to vilify any one  created thing. We would never say the body's bad and the spirit's good because we believe the body  and the spirit are both sinful.

They've both been tainted with sin. The problem in the world is sin,  not this group of people versus this group of people, not culture versus nature or nature versus  culture or anything like that. The Christian worldview never vilifies any one thing, nor does it  idolize anything. You know, so in Marxism, there's certain people that can do no wrong and certain  people can do no right. But every single worldview tends to paint things in black and white because the  protagonist are always these people and the antagonist are always these people.

If you believe the  Christian storyline, your sinners, you are not the good guys. And they're out there, the people  aren't Christians, they're in the image of God. They're not actually the bad guys. Christians  have a story that is the most nuanced of all stories. We should be the slowest to, you know, to put  white hats on some people and dark hats on other people.

And we should be the, it should be the  easiest for us to look into almost anybody else's story, no matter out of any other worldview and say,  yeah, I mean, see, for example, because we believe that every part of the human body is fallen,  every part of the human personality is fallen. If you get a story that talks about the dangers of  sexual activity, okay, but if you get a story that actually lifts up the beauty of sexuality,  that's okay too. See, we're not like Buddhists or the Greeks who just see sexuality is actually  basically a seductive thing because we like the material world. We think it's a good thing. We  think God created the material world and Jesus has a material body.

So Christians ought to be able  to find elements of their story and almost any other story. I mean, obviously there are stories  that you don't want to act in that actually are deliberately trying to lift up the very worst  things and celebrate them. But generally speaking, I would think Christian actors would be able to  find a good reason to act in an awful lot of other stories, an awful lot of other stories because  other stories, people's stories tend to tell part of the Christian story because the Christian  story so comprehensive. Everything is good. Everything was created good and therefore there's  really nothing to be looked at.

But everything is fallen, so there's nothing that you should be  lifting up. So almost any story that shows you the problem of anything is possible. Almost any  story that shows you the goodness of anything is possible. It's all part of the Christian story. One last thing and then we'll take some questions.

At this point, you've got to pretty much act in  other people's stories. But if you ever get a chance to put your own together and act them out,  what I find fascinating about evangelism, I've come to realize that when I was younger, people  said, well, here's how you share your faith and they would give me outlines. There's various  outlines. Let me give you a quick example of the problem with that. My parents' generation,  and they're in their 80s now, the whole generation of my parents had in a sense, there was in  America when they grew up and their depression in World War II, their cultural narrative,  their main cultural story, was what really matters in life is not what you believe, but that you're  a good person, a really good person, that you're decent, you're honest, you're good to your  family, you're hardworking, that was the cultural narrative.

My children who are now in their 20s,  early 20s, my kids, I see they're part of a different generation and their cultural narrative is  not the important thing is to be good. For them, the important thing is to be free and to be free  to be really yourself and not to be enslaved or not to be oppressed or not to be controlled by  anything else. If you say that my kids' generation, the important thing is to be good, they would say  to find good. If you said that to my parents' generation, nobody would say that. Now, what's the gospel?

Well, you can say Jesus died for your sins, yes, of course, but what is  sin? You have to connect, grace sin, you have to connect the Christian story with the baseline  cultural narratives of your own, of the story of the generation. So, for example, what I would say to  I still do to older people, I would say, you think you're good, but you're really not good enough. You actually fall down in all these ways, only through Jesus can you be forgiven. But what I'd say  to my kids' generation is you think you're free, but you're really not.

Because if you make anything  other than Jesus Christ, the center of your life, you're a slave to that. And therefore, only through  Christ will you be freed. Now, by the way, in the Bible, what's interesting, there's a place where  Paul says, he says, the Jews wanted power, and the Greeks wanted wisdom. But I preached them  Christ, the power of God, and the wisdom of God, though foolish and weak. Now, here's what he was  saying.

What he's trying to say is, Greeks were intellectuals, and what they really thought was  important was philosophy and understanding and rationality. The Jews were practicals. And what they  wanted to know is how does it work? They wanted power. They wanted results.

He did not preach Christ  to them the same. What he did was on the one hand, he challenged the Jews' story, basic cultural  story, and said, Jesus Christ seems nuts to you because he came in weakness, a weak Messiah on  the cross. And yet, it's really the strength he've always been looking for. And he says something  differently to the Greeks. He says, Jesus Christ is foolish.

In other words, he wasn't educated,  he didn't go to the right schools, he didn't write any books. And yet, he's got the real wisdom  that you're looking for. In other words, what Paul is trying to say is that only in Jesus Christ  does the baseline cultural story of any group or generation or society have a happy ending. What your society wants, is it wisdom, is it power, is it freedom, is it goodness,  whatever they want, it'll only have a happy ending in Jesus. Otherwise, it'll self-destruct.

Because what it'll do is it'll turn, it'll turn something that's inadequate into the  protagonist's hero. And it'll turn something which is good and created, though fallen, into the  villain, into the antagonist, into the idol. So I would have to say that if you understand the  Christian's story, and you are basically storytellers, which is what actors are. In the long run,  Christianity is so comprehensive that you should be able to appreciate and take part in other  people's stories knowing that you're actually bringing about truth into the people's lives,  you're watching it. And ultimately, I think it's important to really, really get engaged and  really enter in deeply into our own culture stories so that we can understand them and eventually  bring Christ to bear.

If you don't get into the culture, if you don't get into the stories of  the culture, when you do talk about Jesus, it just goes like this, because you're actually  answering questions that they're not asking. Because ultimately, ultimately, the gospel is God  saved you through a story, not through a bunch of principles. God did not show up with a bunch of  principles and said, if you do these things, you'll go to heaven. What happened was God comes in  the world through Jesus Christ and saves you by what he did. He saves you through a story, a true  story, of course, not through you're just being obedient and going to church and obeying.

So salvation is through a story. And the story is so comprehensive. It takes in all other stories  and resolves them. So I know it's a little bit mind-blowing and over. It's not exaggerated.

I absolutely  believe it, but on the other hand, I realize it's a lot to take in. So, would you please, where I  have been obscure, where you want me to elaborate, where I was actually totally obscure? Just raise  a hand and let's start talking about what I just went through. So yeah, right here. What about the issue of holiness for actors?

Because even in some of the best of stories,  they're asked to do things like his or woman who's not their spouse. Maybe where something  we're feeling or you take clothes off or even have to act out of lust or out of cruelty,  have these feelings. And that seems to go against being holy because we don't really have any kind  of standard for this in the Bible. You know, the apostles were never actors or they were never,  it seems like they would never put themselves in those kinds of positions where they would make  themselves that vulnerable to sin. Wait, in other words, do you feel like if you're actually acting  out the sin, but you're not doing the sin?

So what do you mean? In other words, if you're acting out  something that would be wrong if you were doing it in reality, but you're not actually doing it  on the stage, or are you doing it? Let's say you're married and you have to kiss the same  person every day, eight times a week. That can probably maybe create some feelings of lust for  that specific person. Then don't do it.

That's all. I mean, and you have to know your own,  you have to know yourself here. You know, the book, Screwtape Letters by C.S. Lewis, okay. Which by the way, John Cleese, you know who John Cleese is?

John Cleese, though I understand it's  hard to get them anymore. John Cleese has read a selection of them and it's hilarious. He's wonderful. But however, it's a letters of a senior devil to a junior devil on how to attempt human beings. And in the beginning, in the intro, there's an interesting place where Lewis has said that it was  hard.

In other words, he says, in order to write the book, he had to imagine himself being evil,  which isn't terribly hard. And he actually, he quotes a place in Deuteronomy where he says,  my own heart showed me the way of the ungodly. Because he says, because he was a professor of  medieval literature, a couple of reviewers had said, well, the reason this is so realistic about,  you know, how Screwtape's knowledge of sin and temptation and seduction is clearly based on  Professor Lewis's mastery of the medieval literature on moral philosophy and the Catholic church. And Lewis says, just not truly. He says, my own heart showed me the way of the ungodly.

He says,  I, I basically was able to access my own heart, all the evil nasty things and bad things  and that Screwtape did. But he says, there was a place at which I had to stop. Because I said,  by imagining it, I was, he says, at some point I really felt like I was going to suffocate. So I  stopped. Now you see, he couldn't even write that.

Would you have said, oh, he shouldn't write that. He couldn't write that without he had to be careful. Because it was, you know, it's sort of the  opposite of a quiet time where you're trying to get in touch with your best side and you're trying  to fan the flame of, you know, what God has done there by the Holy Spirit. The trouble with if  you're acting the part of an evil person or a wicked person or even writing in his case, it was  a fiction piece. So it's basically the same thing.

He found that there was a limit at one point  where he said, I just have to stop this because it's, you know, I'm accessing parts of myself that  shouldn't be there anyway. So I would say that you have to be very careful, but doesn't mean that  you should never be able to depict badness or sin in this. The Bible depicts it. It's horrible  things in the Bible. And I think most people would say, well, I could act a biblical story, right?

I mean, wouldn't, wouldn't you want to act out a biblical story? But somebody's got to act the  evil people in the biblical story. So at least, and you say, well, it's in, it's in, you know,  it's in the service of telling people the truth. But see, somebody's going to have to do it. See,  watch your own heart.

I just know there's certain people that are able to detach and certainly  hurt not. Now, I know something about the method acting thing unless that's dead now or is it not? No, it's not dead. To me, there's a big difference between saying, I know enough  that I can act this out. And I think that's very different than people say, I want you to hate,  I just want you to fill your heart with hate.

You know, you're supposed to be acting out hate. So I want you to feel hate. I want you to hate the person on the stage. I don't think that's acting  anymore. I'm sorry.

Acting is, you are trying to look like something that you're not. I mean,  there's John Wayne, as I was talking about. There's people who made lots of money with that acting  at all. And there's a few other people I'll name that I won't name. But who clearly don't do any  acting, they just, they obviously just get up there and they feel their feelings and they do what  they do.

And for whatever reason, people have paid money to see it. But I think acting really means  I'm, I'm supposed to act hateful, but not be hateful. And I do, I certainly know there's acting  coaches that want you to be hateful. I don't know what you say. You just smile.

You know, I don't  see how you can, first of all, I'm not sure how you can do that, frankly. I even wonder whether  that's even possible. So watch out. I'm sorry, I should, let's get some other questions, but that was  a great question. It's estimated that most of us spend half of our waking hours at work.

How does  the wisdom of the Bible apply to our careers? In other words, how can our work connect with God's  work? And how can our vocations be more emotional? In his book, Every Good and Devere, Tim Keller draws  from decades of teaching on vocation and calling to show you how to find true joy in your work. As you serve God and others, the book offers surprising insights into how a Christian perspective  on work can serve as the foundation for a thriving career and a balanced personal life.

Every Good  and Devere is our thank you for your gift to help gospel and life share Christ's love with more  people around the world. Just visit gospel and life dot com slash give that's gospel and life dot com slash  give. Let's keep going, Max. Right. Do you have a vision for your demer's role in the second part of that?

I'm off for it. It's not specifically. No, of course. Who knows? I didn't realize when did the Salvation Army  two years ago?

Yeah, you know, you know, Ray Crox, it was in the paper. Did you see that? The founder of McDonald's, his widow recently gave the Salvation Army $1.5 billion. Yeah, four. Well, yeah, but they're trying to create community centers, 25 communities and  that's a lot of money.

Who knows? I'm not sure what they expect to be doing with all that,  but if they're building, if they're able to build small theaters and all that,  yeah, that's, that is beautiful. When you see Flannery O'Connor,  and what I did was I had been here since I read the art, read the short story when I said,  gosh, what would take Bill T. Jones? Clearly, he even says he's hostile to Christianity.

He doesn't like it at all, but he was overwhelmed by what a great story it was. I said, wouldn't it be great? I mean, we don't have many contemporary Christians who create stories  that good, that actually draws people in because they sense the truth of it, even though intellectually,  I mean, intellectually, they don't believe Christian doctrine, but the trouble, a story flies beneath  the radar and hits them in the imagination. Where the Bible says there is a knowledge of God,  Romans 1, where it says they hold down the truth and unrighteousness. There is a knowledge of God,  and stories get to people at that, at that level, frankly.

So I, you know, I would say it's  going to take time for us to, you know, you don't have enough Christians even trying,  and it takes, you know, it takes, it seems to take thousands of people trying to get a few people  through, you know, and hit it. So we need a lot more people trying. But sure, I mean, I'm all  for it. I'm serious, but I can't say beyond that exactly. I know what's going to happen.

I'm open to suggestions. I'm sure you're all ready to give me some. Some other, yes. Go ahead. Could you comment a little bit about working the Christian storyline  deep down into the fabric of something, the way you do it, the law of the race?

Yeah. In other words, the Christian storyline, I didn't mention it because I always thought that,  I thought that actors, I know actors would like to be writers, right? They'd like to put  your own stuff together. Well, also, is there anything, I'm not a part of the question, is there,  is there any other forms of theater or film or anything that you would cite as a very good example  of that, but that it's not, you know, purely a sort of a Christian play on the surface? Oh, yeah.

You know, I should, I need to access my memory tapes. Yes. The question would be,  first question is, and I agree with this, even since I said it, it's nice that I still agree with  what I said a year ago, is that one of the problems that I think a lot of Christians make when they  tell the Christian story is they don't bury the narrative deep in, yeah, in the cultural form. So what was, to me, brilliant about Tolkien, here's a guy, he's a professor of Anglo-Saxon, he's  probably one of the three or four people in the world at his, you know, in his heyday, who knew  the most about Old English, the language and Gothic and Icelandic and Finnish and, you know,  Northern European pagan pre-historical roots. And what he did was he saw, he said,  did you know, for example, Northern European mythology?

You know what Gurdardemmerung is? You know, you say, well, yeah, that's something with Wagner. Do you know, in Northern European  mythology, the Danemois, the final, in the final sort of Armageddon, is that the gods and the heroes  of all the centuries are resurrected to battle against the monsters and the ogres and the demons and  all the villains. There's this huge battle on this particular plane to see who's actually going to  win the world for the rest of eternity. And the gods and the heroes die.

That's what's called  Gurdardemmerung is the twilight of the gods. They all, the good guys lose. And that's how history is  going to go. And the Anglo-Saxon, the Northern European mythology was, that's okay because  nobility is to be good even though you know you're going down to a never ending defeat. That was  nobility.

A high doom was before the hero that I'm going to do what is right. And actually, what's  interesting is if you've ever read the dream of the rude, which is an old English poem, but it's  a Christian poem because Christianity came. They were fascinated by the idea of Jesus Christ going to  the cross. That's nobility. Knowing that the right thing to do was to go down to this terrible defeat.

And that got into the Anglo-Saxon world and sort of, you know, it came in it. It wasn't a complete  head on collision between what Christianity said, the pessimism of the Northern European world  met the optimism of Christianity and it changed the pessimism. But the idea of nobility and heroism  and valor and doing what's right even though you're dying as you do it was not really changed. It  was redeemed. Now, Tolkien tried to imagine the Anglo-Saxon mythology, which is all lost because  those dirty French-speaking Normans came over across the channel in the Battle of Hastings and wiped  out the Anglo-Saxon culture.

We have almost, we have something like 45 pages of Anglo-Saxon  ancient literature and everything, all the rest of it's gone. So what Tolkien said is, I want to imagine  what all that mythology would be like. I'm going to imagine and then I'm going to have to be  pre-Christian. But I'm a Christian. And therefore, what I'm going to do is I'm going to  imagine pre-Christian mythology sort of cleansed of a lot of its pessimism.

Yes, even though if  you read Lord of the Rings, it's sad. It's a very sad. He wanted to keep that and wanted to keep  the idea that you can't win without losing as least as much as you won. And he kept that because  he loved the sadness and he felt that that was part of... He thought that was Christian.

He was  pre-Christian. It was common grace. It was general revelation. It was revelation that came to them  even though they weren't Christians yet. It was truth.

So what he tried to do was he tried to  enter into these ancient myths and preserve the truth and actually enhance it a little bit  from a Christian perspective. And when it was all done, he's a great example of this because  there's no overt reference of any sort in the Lord of the Rings to Christianity or religion or even  God. But when you're all done, you feel cleansed with it. When you read a thing, you say, I've read a  holy thing. I feel cleansed by it.

How did that happen? He buried the narrative, the storyline. So you have Gandalf's resurrected Lord and Frodo's the suffering servant and Aragren's returning  king and you've got it everywhere. But he doesn't have a Christ figure. He's got so many of them.

So if he had a Christ figure, if he had an azzle on or something like that, then it looks like a Christian  fable or a parable. Now what was your second part of your question, though? Is there any? Is there any  other works that you would know? No, but you know, there are a lot of movies when you're done with them  or plays when you're done with them.

You say, it's very obvious the person who wrote that was not a  Christian, but what they wanted to say was very important for people to hear if they're ever going  to be prepared for Christianity. And I see them all over the place. Yeah, I mean, whether or not they  actually realize that they're writing something that is for family. Yeah. You know, I used to  the first movie we had.

It was just like a scene in the hours when Virginia Woolf says to a  Virginia Woolf's husband says to her, why does somebody have to die? And the answer is so that others  will, I can't remember exactly, appreciate life more or something like that. And he says,  who has to die and she says the poet, the visionary? Yeah, there's lots of, you know,  what Lewis said that God gave the pagans good dreams. You know, and there's all sorts of clues  all through them.

You know, the Clint East would move the unforgiven. Anybody know that movie? Very violent movie, really. It's just about a guy who goes and shoots everybody. It's kind of  interesting.

At the very end, this kid sidekick who's seen all this bloodshed, do you remember this  at all? He's just chugging down some alcohol, just trying to study his nerves and he said,  all these people that we've killed, they had a common. They deserved it, right? And Clint East would  say, we all deserve to be killed. We all deserve to die.

We all deserve to be shot. You know,  which of course, from a Christian point of view is absolutely true in a way, but you know, I don't  know what I don't know was in the mind of the writer, but it's all, I mean, I know to some degree,  you actors have got to pay your dues. You've got to act. You've got to get your experience. You've  got to get to know people.

You've got to hone your skills. And very often, you're doing things  that you say, what redeeming social value is this? But on the other hand, a lot of preachers  spend a lot of time doing that in the early days, too. What am I doing for Jesus preaching here  in the middle of hot coffee, Mississippi, to 15 old ladies every Sunday? And a lot of people,  that's how you get started.

It doesn't seem like you're really changing the world. It's not a  whole lot different. So some other. Yes, I'm sorry. Go ahead.

Oh, yeah. I actually had a question. You probably already know this like in the past, like before my age, a lot of actors, like,  well, yeah, like they're excommunicated from their church for acting. And it goes back to the  whole St. Augustine thing about Mendacity and backding and all the aspects.

I just like to think  I just like to hear from you a few more examples of acting in the Bible. Would you say like  Jeremiah portraying something silently? Well, you're asking two good questions. The one question,  of course, is the church has been nasty to actors for many years. And I still have some trouble,  frankly, and I know something about church is I have a little trouble understanding the theological  justification for excluding acting and drama because I keep thinking one of the things is,  it's impossible to preach.

You don't, you know, you're preaching as a form of acting. I don't think  they know that. I mean, you, you're acting out ideas. You're acting out illustration. Sometimes  you're acting out stories.

I'm trying to figure out why they would say, I don't quite completely  understand. There's no doubt that they said you do the immoral things. Your portrayal character was  doing well. Well, yeah, you're portraying. So you're not allowed to, well, see the real, if they had  said you must never write fiction in which you're portraying people doing immoral things.

Which is,  to me, the difference is very, very small, whether you're, whether you're writing a story or acting  out a story, you are still telling a story. And what I can't quite figure out is what the theological  distinction would be between writing the screw tape letters and acting evil on a, you know, acting  like an evil character on the stage. I don't understand. I still haven't figured that out. Now, second  question, oh, in the Bible, my friend, Trevor Longman, who has written the best commentary ever  on Ecclesiastes, says the book of Ecclesiastes is almost certainly a play.

And here's how this works. He wrote his doctoral dissertation at Yale on fictional accadian autobiography,  accadian AKKADIA. And I'm not, don't write it down, but I just want to say what is this? And what he  meant is that in ancient times, in the accadians, which were contemporaries to the Jews and all that,  there was a particular form of, I guess you could say, it was a literary genre, in which in the  beginning you spoke in the first person. And you said, I'm going to tell you this story, I'm going  to do this and this and this, and I'm going to be this person, this person, and then you go into  character.

You say, now I'm this, and I'm doing this, now I'm this, and then we're doing this, now  at the end you come out again and say, now what did we learn? And if you actually look at the  book of Ecclesiastes, which is notoriously hard to outline, because in the very beginning he talks  about, you know, Solomon the King and the third person, and then he talks about I am Solomon the  King and I have seen all these riches and it means nothing to me. It's vanity, all this vanity. And  then suddenly he says, and now I have, you know, I have done learning and I have gotten all my PhDs,  and it means nothing to me. And at the very end he comes out and says, now what have we learned?

And Trempord pretty much proves by saying, this is exactly the kind of literary genre we had  in the past where it's basically one man play. Comes up and says, I'm going to do this,  and then acts it out, and then at the end says, what have we learned? And he says, it's a written  out play which could be acted out and it actually could be acted out extremely well. The other  thing is all the prophets did do acting as you have already wisely alluded to. Ezekiel was the  worst.

I mean, I'm trying to remember what they were, but I mean, Jeremiah would not just come in  and preach a sermon about the fact that you have thrown off God's yoke, he would come in wearing a  yoke. And he would say, you've thrown off God's yoke, or he would take a scroll and cut it up and  throw it in the fire as he was talking and so on. So they acted as well. The problem with saying  you shouldn't be an actor or you shouldn't do those things is that the line between fiction,  writing fiction and acting, the line between preaching and any kind of storytelling,  and then going one step further with a bring an object, you know, one step further bringing a  yoke or something. And the next, what are you doing?

I mean, I don't know how you can, where do you  draw the line? Say, that's acting and that's not. That's stage and that's not. It's impossible. And it's legalistic, frankly, whenever you try to draw lines, the Bible hasn't drawn.

So do you get a lot of it? Well, never mind. Let's keep going. Yes, go ahead. I just want to ask about drawing the line because I tend to look at the whole piece as a whole,  like you were saying, if there was any redeeming value in the in the whole story or the whole  play or whatever, and then, you know, whether that's something that wanted to participate.

Yeah. Because any character you do is going to be doing things that are not righteous and  holy, right? There wouldn't be a story. Right. So you got to have antagonists.

Right. You're going to be dramatic conflicts. You're going to, if I draw the line, there's a point  where you draw the line in terms of what I would portray and also how I view the whole piece, right? Your conscience. Now, this is the sort of thing that you should be trying to come together as actors  in a city and talk about.

And you ought to give one another. Here's how I draw the line. And here's  where I draw the line. And you need to try this out. And maybe, maybe you would develop a cumulative  wisdom that we don't have right now.

And that there might be a, you know, a couple of different theories  that guidelines that Christian actors in New York have developed about where you draw the line. But in  the end, we, we have got a Presbyterians have a confession. And there's a chapter in a confession  called Liberty of Conscience. And that confession says that you mustn't bind other people's conscience  is where the Bible hasn't. So the Bible says you can't commit adultery.

Then you just can't. I'm  sorry, I don't care what God told you. I don't care what you're, you know, you think the Spirit told  you. You can't. But as you say, I can, you know, I can do this on stage.

But I can't do that. I can  do this on stage. Common sense, I think for most Christians would be, you know, that you can't do  that. But we have to be very careful about saying, if you're a Christian, you shouldn't be doing that. Because, because Liberty of Conscience is, the Bible hasn't told me exactly where.

So we're going to  have to use, watch your conscience, do not violate your conscience. See, if you go further than your  conscience, really will let you go, because I need the job, or I want the prestige, or I want the  money, you hurt yourself pretty badly. Don't do it. Don't say, well, you know, everybody else thinks  this is all right. And I guess it's okay.

If your conscience can't bear it, don't you dare do it. It says in James, whatever you do, it's not a faith for you, it's sin. You just cannot do it. So it is important to check your conscience out. You know, you're ahead of your hand up, right?

And then, oh, is this on this? Go ahead. What about the weaker brother? Is that part of your conscience? You're talking about what other people think?

Well, you know, you're part of a community. You're part of a community. And if you find  that you're the only one that thinks it's okay to do that. And, you know, your 25 best Christian  actor friends think it's wrong. You probably ought to think twice.

What if you're just being extra sensitive to that one, or a few people that may be offended? Your artist, you're going to be sensitive. If anybody, if anybody thinks you've done wrong, and they're really disappointed in you,  is that what you mean? In other words, you do something, and you feel like, here's a person over there. It was possible for everyone to stumble.

What defines stumble? Good question. Matt at you, think you're stupid. That's not stumbling. That's true.

You're absolutely right. When the Bible says, don't call somebody to stumble. What that really means is you should not be helping someone else do something. One of the troubles is, the actual place where this happens is Jews  were eating meat off her to idols because in their culture, an idol is nothing. Many of the pagan people had become Christians.

To them, the idols were really a big deal. They had worshipped them and so on. When they saw Jews eating meat off her to idols,  and it didn't bother them, the Gentiles said, I guess I can, and when they did it,  they felt cut off from God and terrible and all that. Paul said, what you're doing is encouraging  somebody else to do something that they just can't do in faith and don't do it, but I'm not quite  sure what that would be here. Be careful.

Stumbling doesn't just mean offend somebody,  or even upset them. Well, I can dance if that may be hard for some people who have issues  watching dance. Fine. Right. I mean, you do know from culture to culture, what is considered  authoritarian in one culture is considered, you know, is considered sort of a normal exercise  authority in what one culture, I mean, it's not what one culture considers a lascivious  another culture doesn't.

So you do ultimately, you do have to beg one another, not to try to  bind people's consciences where the Bible's left them free and just say, you know, I beg you,  if this bothers you, or if you can't do this, if it gets into your heart to be kissing somebody  for eight weeks in a row, then just don't do it. Follow your conscience. But then respect each other's  consciences. Don't say, oh, you know, you're weakling or what's the matter with you. You're not  professional.

What's the matter? Can't you be detached? Nor do the opposite and say, look at that  person who's clearly going into sin, but keep in touch with each other and ask each other,  are you really able to do that? You had your hand up, right? I'm going to go.

The Catholics right now are vastly better at supporting artists than evangelical Christians,  way, way, way past. I mean, yeah, they may have burned a few of you at the stake over the years,  but you know, come on, get, you know, let's buy gospel, buy gospel. But they were actually good. Actually, Flannery O'Connor wrote a great book called Mystery in Manors that is wonderful. It's mainly for writers, but you'd learn a lot from it.

I haven't over here. Yes, go ahead. Let me get just three of you over here. Yes, go ahead. I've seen opera now, but I started out  wanting to be an actress, and one of the things that I faced was that people at church felt that  I was only seeking glory for myself.

And I was wondering what your thoughts are on how we can  project what attitude we should have as artists and what attitude, how can we help people? If you were singing the church, that'd be different. Well, as if you're singing in the church, that's not seeking glory for yourself. I mean, think about this. I mean, have any of you ever been inquires?

Do you think there's any people inquires around the country that are seeking glory for themselves now? What about preachers? Do you think there's any preachers? I mean, everybody who's up front  is God of the danger of seeking glory for themselves. I think just what you have to say, of course,  it's a huge danger, but we don't have any more, say we have the same amount of danger of that  that the ministers do or the Christian singers do.

So nevertheless, after you  have dealt with that problem, it is a problem, by the way. I mean, you know, I have to say,  why am I really doing this? If I hone certain skills that are like acting to some degree,  I hone certain skills. It's sort of preaching as a combination. In some ways, I've got to be a good  writer.

In some ways, I've got to be a good actor. And if I hone those skills and people come out to  listen to me, you've come out to listen to me, why am I doing that? I mean, I've got the same problem  you do. I mean, it's no different. It's a big problem.

But just because you want to be an artist  or an opera singer and actor doesn't mean you've got a bigger problem than anybody else, that's all. I would not say to a Christian, oh, you can't. Again, the conscience, very important. Where is the totalization line getting drawn here? I mean, you know, there's some stuff you say  obvious.

Everybody knows, you know, there's, you know, full frontal nudity. And I mean,  there's some things to say, okay, so we start where we all agree you're not going to do. But then  what happens is as we go, what about this? What about this show? What about this show?

Next thing you  know, we're divided. Somebody say, well, I don't have a problem with that. And somebody say, we  have those conversations. And then please respect each other's decisions. And over a generation,  you could become wise as a Christian community and come to more consensus and work the thing out.

Just don't freak out over somebody. There's always somebody to your left and somebody to your right. There's always somebody who thinks you're the liberal, you know, or you're the sell-out, or there's  somebody who thinks you're the moralist, you're the legalist. I generally feel that you, like I  said, just like ministers, you gotta, you gotta take roles that at least, me, you gotta do some  things that at least are probably useless. You know, they're useless to society.

They don't really  do much of anything. I just want stuff that is really, you know, really, there is plenty of stuff  out there that is just trying to pull away traditional values. It's just after it. They're just  trying to do it. I don't want to be part of that.

But how do we know that ones there and there  talk about it with each other? Try to draw lines. You're not going to figure this out overnight. You're not going to figure out overnight. The younger you are, the more you're likely you are to do  things that you just, you know, you feel a little bad in the conscience, but I think you can do it,  but watch it and talk to each other about it.

And don't and don't violate your conscience very much. You know, once, once you know you violated it back out, when you're not sure, sometimes I can't tell  I violated it till I try and then I realize I'm over the line. Let's keep going. Yes, sure. Do I work hard?

Do I push, you know, and that element of saying, hey,  about I know you're in control of this and trusting him and then doing my part as well in terms of  what business aspect of this. And that really plus any question, but simply for acting. Well, you know, the problem with acting is that you don't get nearly as much negative. There's almost no  other career where you get so much negative assessment. You just don't get turned down.

I mean,  it's just nuts. You know, once a year, you can take a job in one of these high rates,  once a year, you sit down, you get a performance evaluation and they say, well, you're not doing  very well. Or maybe even we're going to fire you if you don't stop this and it's, you know,  and then six months later they fire you. That's a lot better than being an actor where you get all  these turn downs and being ignored. It's pretty tough.

So I, and actually I really do think it's  because of that a lot, as you all know, I guess your community is filled with people who have a lot of  a lot of emotional well fragility. Yeah, really emotionally fragile, which doesn't surprise me. I don't think I'm not sure you're emotionally fragile and therefore you want to be an actor. I think you're an actor and next thing you know, you're like, you know, but so you do need that,  but nevertheless, with any career, you have to say, when have I, should I be pushing harder,  is that why I'm not getting any further? And when do I give up and try something else?

But on the other hand, when I was in seminary, there was seminaries that train ministers,  they don't care whether you're gifted or called or going to be any good, they just didn't want  your tuition. So they're putting you through and halfway through or at the end, people are saying,  I want to be a minister and almost everybody can look and say, that person's never going to be a  minister. A person doesn't have what it takes, but nobody told them about that. So actually I  spent a good deal of time because some of you heard me do this before. I came up with a,  with a three, a tripod called Ability Affinity Opportunity and Ability means you're good and other  people think you're good.

Affinity means I'm really passionate. I love it. Opportunity means God  opens the doors. And you might say, how do I know whether or not I'm, you can't mess up your life. You can't.

Just the other day, somebody called me and said, I listened to sermon by somebody and  they seemed to indicate that the reason I'm not married is because I'm not praying enough. Okay. And I want to be married and I'm not praying enough. And so is the reason I'm not married  because I'm not praying enough and therefore I'm, I'm sinning. I said, well, you know, Jacob's  sinned.

He dressed up as he saw and he ruined his whole family and created all, you know, I just  really screwed everything up. And God used the sin to find him the family that God wanted him to have. He wouldn't had, he wouldn't have found the family wouldn't had the children. It was all through  the sin. So I said, what, what about your theory that the reason my life's not going the way  God wants it is because maybe I'm sinning.

I personally think God is so sovereign that if you sin,  if you do something wrong, there's going to be devastation in your life for a long time and it's  your fault. And yet if you sin and if you're his child and he loves you, then all those promises  are going to come to you anyway and he'll bring his blessing into your life through the sin. Now, you know, you'll spend all your life wishing you hadn't done it and you shouldn't have done it. But he's, you can't mess up your life. So don't, just don't kill yourself trying to be successful  if he's just don't.

However, if after a period of time, and I don't know how long to tell people  to wait, the affinity, ability and opportunity don't come together. There's some people who want to  do it and everybody says they can do it and the opportunity is just don't come. You're just never  the right person at the right place in the right time with the right cheekbone structure. You know how that works. You know, it has not, you know, so often it has has absolutely nothing to do  with talent, just that I'm looking for somebody your size, the your cheekbone structure, you know,  the way you wink, you know, that's the way that we want.

And next thing, you know, the career is made. You know, if that will make you a Calvinist, I don't know what will. I don't know what will. So, well, if the opportunity doesn't come, or if you, you know, unless they all come together at once  and after you've knocked and knocked and knocked and knocked, then don't be afraid that somehow you have  failed to, you've met, mucked up your life that God wanted you to be an actor and now you can't be  because you didn't try hard enough, just relax a little bit. So, in some ways, you are where everybody  else is, but I think it is mostly harder to stay at acting long term if you just don't have those  doors open.

Other people can work a lot longer at their job before they say, I'm going to try something  else. So, you do need to support each other, but in the end, I think acting, actually, most people  I know who've been actors who go do something else, it enriches their ability to do a lot of other  things. Don't think, I put all this time into it, almost almost anything else you do. Presentation  is very important and your ability to do presentation and to know how to do presenting to people will  stand you in good stead for a long time.

### English Transcript (for reference)

Today on the podcast, Tim Keller helps us  understand how the Gospel frees us to have hope and joy in our vocations. This is a sermon with a nice climax moving on. This is a string of random thoughts. It's  possible you get more out of the questions and answers afterwards than whatever I tell you about  now, but I think you need to know if you're Christian, what is the rationale for being an actor? You know, why should Christians be actors?

Why should Christians be actors? What do actors do of  any worth from a Christian point of view? That's what I want to talk about. So that's why I mean,  I have a series of random thoughts on that. But let me start by getting you something out of the  New York Times.

I was intrigued by the fact that Bill T. Jones, the dancer and choreographer,  etc, has a new piece that he's putting on based on Flannery O'Connor's, one of Flannery O'Connor's  short stories. Now what's interesting is here's Bill T. Jones. He says, this is his interview.

He says,  I'm angry as hell at the Bush administration. I'm not pleased with the fundamentalist  lineage in this country. And he's sort of ranting and raging as a sort of normal typical New York  secular liberal person. However, he was utterly entranced with Flannery O'Connor's short stories. And he comes right out and says, he's just overwhelmed.

He says, the best short stories. And he wanted to  put them on stage, at least one of them. And what's intriguing is, first of all, number one, the stories,  the one he used is incredibly overtly Christian. It's a story about a grandfather and a grandson  who are living alone in the hinterland of Georgia in the probably in the 30s or 40s. And the boy is just getting uppity.

So the grandfather says, I'm going to take him into  Atlanta because he wants to go to the big city. And he's really almost never seen running water. He's never seen almost anything. And he's not going to take him to the big city until you get your  fill of it. And then you'll see, you know, it's nothing special.

And he takes him in and unfortunately  the boy likes what he sees and he's getting more and more what he would consider uppity. And at one  point, the grandfather, when the boy's taking a nap, abandons him, just runs away from him, gets around  a corner just to show him, just to teach him a lesson. It's very mean-spirited. Also all during  the, obviously all during the story, the grandfather is showing, you know, tremendously realistic  but really venal racist attitudes, you know, everywhere. So he's, you don't like him at all.

And when he abandons his grandson and he scares the grandson, there's a terrible incident which  the boy just runs through the crowd just screaming, where is the grandfather,  knocks a woman over the police come, the police want to know who's boy is this and the grandfather  is so scared because he never deals with the police actually denies the boy, denies that he's the  boy's grandfather and walks away. And there's this horrible rift. And in the end, in a very enigmatic  and fascinating way, the boy forgives the grandfather. Now, Bill T. Jones, he comes right out and says,  this is fascinating to me.

And I'll reach at the end of it. He says, Flannery O'Connor is a non-ironic  Catholic believer. Now, and she is a very strong Christian Catholic believer. And here's what Bill  T. Jones said.

He says, she believes that there's this thing called grace and that grace sometimes hits  us right between the eyes when we are mostly based. Now she and I may disagree on this. He disagrees  with the basic idea. And while O'Connor seems to make all these connections that I may not agree on,  all I know is it's a tremendously powerful, overwhelmingly strong story and I wanted to put it  on stage. In fact, here's how it ends.

He just talked about how overtly Christian it is. The  grandfather's name is Mr. Head, by the way. It's that Mr. Head stood very still and felt the action  of mercy touch him because at the very end the boy forgives him and says, let's go home.

He says,  he felt the action of mercy touch him but this time he knew that there were no words in the world  that could name it. He understood that mercy grew out of agony, which is not denied to any man  and which is given in strange ways to children. He understood that it was all a man could carry into  death to give his maker and he suddenly burned with shame that he had so little of it to take with him. He stood appalled judging himself with the thoroughness of God while the action of mercy covered  his pride like a flame and consumed it. He had never thought himself a great sinner before but  he now saw that his true depravity had been hidden from him lest it caused him to spare.

He realized  that he was forgiven for sins from the beginning of time when he had conceived in his own heart the  sin of Adam until the present when he had denied poor Nelson, that's his grandson. He saw that  Nelson was too monstrous for him to claim his own and since God loved in proportion as he  forgave, he felt ready at that instant to enter paradise. Bilti Jones is putting this on. Now why  it's a tremendously well told story. It's not an essay which he could have easily written  on why there is a God and we are sinful and God does forgive us in proportion to our  our sin and only if we understand where sinners can we turn and get the mercy and therefore the  worst we know ourselves to be the more mercy we get.

In other words, he could have written that essay  and Bilti Jones wouldn't even have read it. It wouldn't even have turned it over but it's a story. If somebody at one point asked Flierry O'Connor, he said, I'm trying to understand this story  I read of years and it's wonderful. Could you give me a nutshell what it means? Just in a nutshell,  a sentence or two what it means.

You know what she said? Very famous. She said, if I could give it to  you in a nutshell, I wouldn't have had to write the story. If I could have told it to you in two  sentences, I wouldn't have had to write the story. Now, what are actors?

There's a difference between  writers and actors. His actors are like Jesus making the word flesh. They're taking a story  which is invisible and making it visible. You know, Jesus was the word made flesh. There was a word  but it was invisible and he embodied it.

Now what actors do is they tell stories but they don't  just tell stories. They embody stories. Of course, you really can't tell a story without acting  to some degree but you are embodying a story and people need stories and stories are just about  the best possible way to change people's worldview, change people's understanding of things and  that's what you do. Now let me back up and give you a couple random when I say random. They're not  totally random because they're kind of, they're sort of logical but some ideas about what stories are  and why they have the impact they have.

First of all, what's the story? You might find this odd. The best place I've ever read a definition of a story is in the Harvard Business Review. A two or three Hollywood screenwriters wrote an article because the Harvard Business Review was  saying it CEOs when they're trying to persuade people stupidly, use graphs and figures  and they just give you facts and figures. He says that's not what changes people's minds.

That's not  what motivates people. You need to tell a story. And they have no idea what about stories in  MBA school. So they said here's what a story is. Three things.

First of all, well, it's actually two  things in a way. Something knocks life off balance. You do not have a story unless something has knocked  life out of whack. So you know, the classic is Lillard Riding Hood took her grandmother goodies is a  principal. It's a fact.

You know, it's a graph. It's not a story. But Lillard Riding Hood  went to take her grandmother goodies, but the big bad wolf had eaten her grandmother and was waiting  for her in bed. That's a story. Something is, you know, knocked life out of whack.

Then because  something is knocked life out of whack, you have, and there's been a lot of ink spilled about this  for years now, you have protagonist and antagonist. A protagonist means a pro-agonizer. You're  agonizing for something. And the antagonist is the anti-agonizer. And the protagonist is trying  to get life back in balance.

And the antagonists are the people who are against you or the forces  that are against you that are trying to stop you from do that. You don't have a story unless you  have protagonist and antagonist. And when I said there's been a lot of ink spilled over the years  about this, I'm going to tell you in a minute that almost everybody from liberal to conservative  realizes that the reason stories are so powerful is that there's no way for a human being to  attach meaning to anything unless you put it into a storyline. And there's no such thing as a  storyline without something being knocked off balance, and some people struggling to put it back  in balance, and some people against them, right? You don't have a story unless you've got good  guys and bad guys, or at least of some sort.

And the reason people are pretty upset about that is  if you can't attach meaning to something without a story, and if story is got always  protagonists and antagonists, there's no way to attach meaning to anything without  basically dividing the world into good guys and bad guys. And every master story that helps  you organize reality has to have, quote, the other capital O. Somebody that we see is the bad guy. And that is one of the problems we have in the world right now. And you can ask me more about  if you want.

So a story is something knocks life off a balance. Protagonists try to get it back  in balance against the eye tag, and I guess the third thing you would say is the resolution of  the story is is the mission success or not. Stories don't have to have happy endings. You know, they can have ambiguous endings, they can have like no endings, which of course is  really cool and avant garde, you know, not to end it. But the point of the matter is even if that  you don't end the story, if you don't end it happily, you know the story should end, or you know  the story hasn't ended.

Because you know that stories have endings. And so maybe the story, maybe  the play, maybe the movie doesn't really tell you how it ends, but you know there should be an end. That's what a story is. Now, I already said this. That's the first thing.

That's what a story is. Secondly, I already alluded to this. You cannot attach meaning to anything unless you  put it in a storyline. Now my best examples of this, my favorite example, this is 9-11. There's a liberal storyline.

And the liberal storyline is America are the bad people in the world,  and the oppressed in the poor are the good. And there's a conservative storyline, which is America  are the good people. We believe in democracy and we're good people. And out there is all sorts of  totalitarianism and all sorts of, you know, low IQ and all sorts of other people. And so we're  the good guys and they're the bad guys as opposed to liberal.

And so what happened when 9-11 comes  along? What do they do? Some people said, you see, they hate us because we are so big and so bad. Conservative said, see, they hate us because we're so good. And now we have to do something about it.

In other words, what they immediately did was they said, what this means is we got to do a war  on terror. The liberal said what this means is we've got to, you know, admit what we're doing in  the world and how people hate us and so on. They took the incident and they couldn't make sense of  it unless they brought it into a storyline. Now the best storyline was actually Giuliani and  Pataki. And what they said was this tragedy can make us a stronger city.

If we pull together,  we can do it. We can do it. So what they did was they, you know, they put it in a different  storyline. But nobody could talk about it without putting it into a storyline. Nobody could just give  you facts.

You can't make sense of anything. You can't attach meaning to anything unless you put  it into a narrative. You watch newspapers, look at plays, everybody's got the assumption behind  every story is life ought to be in a certain way. Something has knocked it off balance. And these are  the people trying to put it into balance and these are the people who are against it.

Now first  of all, that means you can't attach meaning to your own life unless you have a master storyline. There's some people who say my master storyline is I am bringing myself out of very, very humble  roots and abusive background. And I'm going to make something of myself. That's their storyline. Other people, it's a quest for true love.

There's no doubt about it. That's their storyline. Other people, I'm a free spirit artist and I'm trying to make the world safe for free spirit artists  like me. And, you know, it's the oppressive, traditional people that really is why the world is  bad. Everybody's got a narrative by which they are saying, this is what my life means.

And, and this would be in the book, if any of you read that book that I'd recommend it to Luan. What that book says is everybody has a worldview, which is you can't operate without a kind of macro  story view of what the world story is. In other words, when you look out in the world,  obviously the world's not what it ought to be. Something is knocked the world off whack. Poverty isn't a good thing.

War isn't a good thing. Races isn't a good thing. You know,  psychological problems are a good thing. What is wrong with the world? And we'll put it right.

So, Marx had an idea. He kind of vilified, you know, the in a bourgeois and he vilified the,  you know, the owners of the means of production. And he said, basically, state control of economy  will make the difference. Freud had an approach. Everybody's got an approach.

Buddhist say,  the real problem is individual consciousness. You think you're an individual self and you don't  see your part of the old soul. See, Plato and the Greeks, they said the real problem is the material  world and the way it drags you down. Everybody says, this here is the villain. This is the antagonist.

This is what's wrong. And here's what you have to do to put it right. Everybody's got that. And they're called worldviews. No matter who you are, you can't live without one.

But a worldview is actually just a master narrative of what you think is wrong with the world,  who's on the right side to get it back, who's on the wrong side, who's against getting it back,  and what do we have to do? Now, what this means for Christians is this. The biggest problem,  of course, that actors have, unlike writers or maybe other kinds of artists, is generally speaking,  unless you, I guess some of you have done this, you're acting out. You're embodying stories  that somebody else has written. And you might say, was Christians, you say, I never act in a story  that I feel like is a great Christian story with a Christian message to it.

Well, I want you to  consider something for a second. What is the Christian master story? What do we think the world  story is? What do we think the main problem is? What do we think the master story is?

Here's  let me give it to you in a nutshell. Everything was created good, but everything has fallen  through sin. Everything is broken through sin. And through Christ, everything's going to be redeemed. Now, let me tell you what that means.

A Greek worldview says the body's bad. The spirit is good. The Buddhist worldview says the spirit is good, but material reality is an illusion. You know, Marx would actually say, you know, the capitalists are bad and the proletariat's good. The awful lot of conservatives would say it's the other way around.

You know, the proletariat,  the great unwashed, we have to watch out, you know, about, we have to be careful about them. You know, they don't know what's, you know, there's Hobbes as opposed to Locke. Everybody had,  everybody said, this is what's wrong with the world. The Christian story refuses to vilify any one  created thing. We would never say the body's bad and the spirit's good because we believe the body  and the spirit are both sinful.

They've both been tainted with sin. The problem in the world is sin,  not this group of people versus this group of people, not culture versus nature or nature versus  culture or anything like that. The Christian worldview never vilifies any one thing, nor does it  idolize anything. You know, so in Marxism, there's certain people that can do no wrong and certain  people can do no right. But every single worldview tends to paint things in black and white because the  protagonist are always these people and the antagonist are always these people.

If you believe the  Christian storyline, your sinners, you are not the good guys. And they're out there, the people  aren't Christians, they're in the image of God. They're not actually the bad guys. Christians  have a story that is the most nuanced of all stories. We should be the slowest to, you know, to put  white hats on some people and dark hats on other people.

And we should be the, it should be the  easiest for us to look into almost anybody else's story, no matter out of any other worldview and say,  yeah, I mean, see, for example, because we believe that every part of the human body is fallen,  every part of the human personality is fallen. If you get a story that talks about the dangers of  sexual activity, okay, but if you get a story that actually lifts up the beauty of sexuality,  that's okay too. See, we're not like Buddhists or the Greeks who just see sexuality is actually  basically a seductive thing because we like the material world. We think it's a good thing. We  think God created the material world and Jesus has a material body.

So Christians ought to be able  to find elements of their story and almost any other story. I mean, obviously there are stories  that you don't want to act in that actually are deliberately trying to lift up the very worst  things and celebrate them. But generally speaking, I would think Christian actors would be able to  find a good reason to act in an awful lot of other stories, an awful lot of other stories because  other stories, people's stories tend to tell part of the Christian story because the Christian  story so comprehensive. Everything is good. Everything was created good and therefore there's  really nothing to be looked at.

But everything is fallen, so there's nothing that you should be  lifting up. So almost any story that shows you the problem of anything is possible. Almost any  story that shows you the goodness of anything is possible. It's all part of the Christian story. One last thing and then we'll take some questions.

At this point, you've got to pretty much act in  other people's stories. But if you ever get a chance to put your own together and act them out,  what I find fascinating about evangelism, I've come to realize that when I was younger, people  said, well, here's how you share your faith and they would give me outlines. There's various  outlines. Let me give you a quick example of the problem with that. My parents' generation,  and they're in their 80s now, the whole generation of my parents had in a sense, there was in  America when they grew up and their depression in World War II, their cultural narrative,  their main cultural story, was what really matters in life is not what you believe, but that you're  a good person, a really good person, that you're decent, you're honest, you're good to your  family, you're hardworking, that was the cultural narrative.

My children who are now in their 20s,  early 20s, my kids, I see they're part of a different generation and their cultural narrative is  not the important thing is to be good. For them, the important thing is to be free and to be free  to be really yourself and not to be enslaved or not to be oppressed or not to be controlled by  anything else. If you say that my kids' generation, the important thing is to be good, they would say  to find good. If you said that to my parents' generation, nobody would say that. Now, what's the gospel?

Well, you can say Jesus died for your sins, yes, of course, but what is  sin? You have to connect, grace sin, you have to connect the Christian story with the baseline  cultural narratives of your own, of the story of the generation. So, for example, what I would say to  I still do to older people, I would say, you think you're good, but you're really not good enough. You actually fall down in all these ways, only through Jesus can you be forgiven. But what I'd say  to my kids' generation is you think you're free, but you're really not.

Because if you make anything  other than Jesus Christ, the center of your life, you're a slave to that. And therefore, only through  Christ will you be freed. Now, by the way, in the Bible, what's interesting, there's a place where  Paul says, he says, the Jews wanted power, and the Greeks wanted wisdom. But I preached them  Christ, the power of God, and the wisdom of God, though foolish and weak. Now, here's what he was  saying.

What he's trying to say is, Greeks were intellectuals, and what they really thought was  important was philosophy and understanding and rationality. The Jews were practicals. And what they  wanted to know is how does it work? They wanted power. They wanted results.

He did not preach Christ  to them the same. What he did was on the one hand, he challenged the Jews' story, basic cultural  story, and said, Jesus Christ seems nuts to you because he came in weakness, a weak Messiah on  the cross. And yet, it's really the strength he've always been looking for. And he says something  differently to the Greeks. He says, Jesus Christ is foolish.

In other words, he wasn't educated,  he didn't go to the right schools, he didn't write any books. And yet, he's got the real wisdom  that you're looking for. In other words, what Paul is trying to say is that only in Jesus Christ  does the baseline cultural story of any group or generation or society have a happy ending. What your society wants, is it wisdom, is it power, is it freedom, is it goodness,  whatever they want, it'll only have a happy ending in Jesus. Otherwise, it'll self-destruct.

Because what it'll do is it'll turn, it'll turn something that's inadequate into the  protagonist's hero. And it'll turn something which is good and created, though fallen, into the  villain, into the antagonist, into the idol. So I would have to say that if you understand the  Christian's story, and you are basically storytellers, which is what actors are. In the long run,  Christianity is so comprehensive that you should be able to appreciate and take part in other  people's stories knowing that you're actually bringing about truth into the people's lives,  you're watching it. And ultimately, I think it's important to really, really get engaged and  really enter in deeply into our own culture stories so that we can understand them and eventually  bring Christ to bear.

If you don't get into the culture, if you don't get into the stories of  the culture, when you do talk about Jesus, it just goes like this, because you're actually  answering questions that they're not asking. Because ultimately, ultimately, the gospel is God  saved you through a story, not through a bunch of principles. God did not show up with a bunch of  principles and said, if you do these things, you'll go to heaven. What happened was God comes in  the world through Jesus Christ and saves you by what he did. He saves you through a story, a true  story, of course, not through you're just being obedient and going to church and obeying.

So salvation is through a story. And the story is so comprehensive. It takes in all other stories  and resolves them. So I know it's a little bit mind-blowing and over. It's not exaggerated.

I absolutely  believe it, but on the other hand, I realize it's a lot to take in. So, would you please, where I  have been obscure, where you want me to elaborate, where I was actually totally obscure? Just raise  a hand and let's start talking about what I just went through. So yeah, right here. What about the issue of holiness for actors?

Because even in some of the best of stories,  they're asked to do things like his or woman who's not their spouse. Maybe where something  we're feeling or you take clothes off or even have to act out of lust or out of cruelty,  have these feelings. And that seems to go against being holy because we don't really have any kind  of standard for this in the Bible. You know, the apostles were never actors or they were never,  it seems like they would never put themselves in those kinds of positions where they would make  themselves that vulnerable to sin. Wait, in other words, do you feel like if you're actually acting  out the sin, but you're not doing the sin?

So what do you mean? In other words, if you're acting out  something that would be wrong if you were doing it in reality, but you're not actually doing it  on the stage, or are you doing it? Let's say you're married and you have to kiss the same  person every day, eight times a week. That can probably maybe create some feelings of lust for  that specific person. Then don't do it.

That's all. I mean, and you have to know your own,  you have to know yourself here. You know, the book, Screwtape Letters by C.S. Lewis, okay. Which by the way, John Cleese, you know who John Cleese is?

John Cleese, though I understand it's  hard to get them anymore. John Cleese has read a selection of them and it's hilarious. He's wonderful. But however, it's a letters of a senior devil to a junior devil on how to attempt human beings. And in the beginning, in the intro, there's an interesting place where Lewis has said that it was  hard.

In other words, he says, in order to write the book, he had to imagine himself being evil,  which isn't terribly hard. And he actually, he quotes a place in Deuteronomy where he says,  my own heart showed me the way of the ungodly. Because he says, because he was a professor of  medieval literature, a couple of reviewers had said, well, the reason this is so realistic about,  you know, how Screwtape's knowledge of sin and temptation and seduction is clearly based on  Professor Lewis's mastery of the medieval literature on moral philosophy and the Catholic church. And Lewis says, just not truly. He says, my own heart showed me the way of the ungodly.

He says,  I, I basically was able to access my own heart, all the evil nasty things and bad things  and that Screwtape did. But he says, there was a place at which I had to stop. Because I said,  by imagining it, I was, he says, at some point I really felt like I was going to suffocate. So I  stopped. Now you see, he couldn't even write that.

Would you have said, oh, he shouldn't write that. He couldn't write that without he had to be careful. Because it was, you know, it's sort of the  opposite of a quiet time where you're trying to get in touch with your best side and you're trying  to fan the flame of, you know, what God has done there by the Holy Spirit. The trouble with if  you're acting the part of an evil person or a wicked person or even writing in his case, it was  a fiction piece. So it's basically the same thing.

He found that there was a limit at one point  where he said, I just have to stop this because it's, you know, I'm accessing parts of myself that  shouldn't be there anyway. So I would say that you have to be very careful, but doesn't mean that  you should never be able to depict badness or sin in this. The Bible depicts it. It's horrible  things in the Bible. And I think most people would say, well, I could act a biblical story, right?

I mean, wouldn't, wouldn't you want to act out a biblical story? But somebody's got to act the  evil people in the biblical story. So at least, and you say, well, it's in, it's in, you know,  it's in the service of telling people the truth. But see, somebody's going to have to do it. See,  watch your own heart.

I just know there's certain people that are able to detach and certainly  hurt not. Now, I know something about the method acting thing unless that's dead now or is it not? No, it's not dead. To me, there's a big difference between saying, I know enough  that I can act this out. And I think that's very different than people say, I want you to hate,  I just want you to fill your heart with hate.

You know, you're supposed to be acting out hate. So I want you to feel hate. I want you to hate the person on the stage. I don't think that's acting  anymore. I'm sorry.

Acting is, you are trying to look like something that you're not. I mean,  there's John Wayne, as I was talking about. There's people who made lots of money with that acting  at all. And there's a few other people I'll name that I won't name. But who clearly don't do any  acting, they just, they obviously just get up there and they feel their feelings and they do what  they do.

And for whatever reason, people have paid money to see it. But I think acting really means  I'm, I'm supposed to act hateful, but not be hateful. And I do, I certainly know there's acting  coaches that want you to be hateful. I don't know what you say. You just smile.

You know, I don't  see how you can, first of all, I'm not sure how you can do that, frankly. I even wonder whether  that's even possible. So watch out. I'm sorry, I should, let's get some other questions, but that was  a great question. It's estimated that most of us spend half of our waking hours at work.

How does  the wisdom of the Bible apply to our careers? In other words, how can our work connect with God's  work? And how can our vocations be more emotional? In his book, Every Good and Devere, Tim Keller draws  from decades of teaching on vocation and calling to show you how to find true joy in your work. As you serve God and others, the book offers surprising insights into how a Christian perspective  on work can serve as the foundation for a thriving career and a balanced personal life.

Every Good  and Devere is our thank you for your gift to help gospel and life share Christ's love with more  people around the world. Just visit gospel and life dot com slash give that's gospel and life dot com slash  give. Let's keep going, Max. Right. Do you have a vision for your demer's role in the second part of that?

I'm off for it. It's not specifically. No, of course. Who knows? I didn't realize when did the Salvation Army  two years ago?

Yeah, you know, you know, Ray Crox, it was in the paper. Did you see that? The founder of McDonald's, his widow recently gave the Salvation Army $1.5 billion. Yeah, four. Well, yeah, but they're trying to create community centers, 25 communities and  that's a lot of money.

Who knows? I'm not sure what they expect to be doing with all that,  but if they're building, if they're able to build small theaters and all that,  yeah, that's, that is beautiful. When you see Flannery O'Connor,  and what I did was I had been here since I read the art, read the short story when I said,  gosh, what would take Bill T. Jones? Clearly, he even says he's hostile to Christianity.

He doesn't like it at all, but he was overwhelmed by what a great story it was. I said, wouldn't it be great? I mean, we don't have many contemporary Christians who create stories  that good, that actually draws people in because they sense the truth of it, even though intellectually,  I mean, intellectually, they don't believe Christian doctrine, but the trouble, a story flies beneath  the radar and hits them in the imagination. Where the Bible says there is a knowledge of God,  Romans 1, where it says they hold down the truth and unrighteousness. There is a knowledge of God,  and stories get to people at that, at that level, frankly.

So I, you know, I would say it's  going to take time for us to, you know, you don't have enough Christians even trying,  and it takes, you know, it takes, it seems to take thousands of people trying to get a few people  through, you know, and hit it. So we need a lot more people trying. But sure, I mean, I'm all  for it. I'm serious, but I can't say beyond that exactly. I know what's going to happen.

I'm open to suggestions. I'm sure you're all ready to give me some. Some other, yes. Go ahead. Could you comment a little bit about working the Christian storyline  deep down into the fabric of something, the way you do it, the law of the race?

Yeah. In other words, the Christian storyline, I didn't mention it because I always thought that,  I thought that actors, I know actors would like to be writers, right? They'd like to put  your own stuff together. Well, also, is there anything, I'm not a part of the question, is there,  is there any other forms of theater or film or anything that you would cite as a very good example  of that, but that it's not, you know, purely a sort of a Christian play on the surface? Oh, yeah.

You know, I should, I need to access my memory tapes. Yes. The question would be,  first question is, and I agree with this, even since I said it, it's nice that I still agree with  what I said a year ago, is that one of the problems that I think a lot of Christians make when they  tell the Christian story is they don't bury the narrative deep in, yeah, in the cultural form. So what was, to me, brilliant about Tolkien, here's a guy, he's a professor of Anglo-Saxon, he's  probably one of the three or four people in the world at his, you know, in his heyday, who knew  the most about Old English, the language and Gothic and Icelandic and Finnish and, you know,  Northern European pagan pre-historical roots. And what he did was he saw, he said,  did you know, for example, Northern European mythology?

You know what Gurdardemmerung is? You know, you say, well, yeah, that's something with Wagner. Do you know, in Northern European  mythology, the Danemois, the final, in the final sort of Armageddon, is that the gods and the heroes  of all the centuries are resurrected to battle against the monsters and the ogres and the demons and  all the villains. There's this huge battle on this particular plane to see who's actually going to  win the world for the rest of eternity. And the gods and the heroes die.

That's what's called  Gurdardemmerung is the twilight of the gods. They all, the good guys lose. And that's how history is  going to go. And the Anglo-Saxon, the Northern European mythology was, that's okay because  nobility is to be good even though you know you're going down to a never ending defeat. That was  nobility.

A high doom was before the hero that I'm going to do what is right. And actually, what's  interesting is if you've ever read the dream of the rude, which is an old English poem, but it's  a Christian poem because Christianity came. They were fascinated by the idea of Jesus Christ going to  the cross. That's nobility. Knowing that the right thing to do was to go down to this terrible defeat.

And that got into the Anglo-Saxon world and sort of, you know, it came in it. It wasn't a complete  head on collision between what Christianity said, the pessimism of the Northern European world  met the optimism of Christianity and it changed the pessimism. But the idea of nobility and heroism  and valor and doing what's right even though you're dying as you do it was not really changed. It  was redeemed. Now, Tolkien tried to imagine the Anglo-Saxon mythology, which is all lost because  those dirty French-speaking Normans came over across the channel in the Battle of Hastings and wiped  out the Anglo-Saxon culture.

We have almost, we have something like 45 pages of Anglo-Saxon  ancient literature and everything, all the rest of it's gone. So what Tolkien said is, I want to imagine  what all that mythology would be like. I'm going to imagine and then I'm going to have to be  pre-Christian. But I'm a Christian. And therefore, what I'm going to do is I'm going to  imagine pre-Christian mythology sort of cleansed of a lot of its pessimism.

Yes, even though if  you read Lord of the Rings, it's sad. It's a very sad. He wanted to keep that and wanted to keep  the idea that you can't win without losing as least as much as you won. And he kept that because  he loved the sadness and he felt that that was part of... He thought that was Christian.

He was  pre-Christian. It was common grace. It was general revelation. It was revelation that came to them  even though they weren't Christians yet. It was truth.

So what he tried to do was he tried to  enter into these ancient myths and preserve the truth and actually enhance it a little bit  from a Christian perspective. And when it was all done, he's a great example of this because  there's no overt reference of any sort in the Lord of the Rings to Christianity or religion or even  God. But when you're all done, you feel cleansed with it. When you read a thing, you say, I've read a  holy thing. I feel cleansed by it.

How did that happen? He buried the narrative, the storyline. So you have Gandalf's resurrected Lord and Frodo's the suffering servant and Aragren's returning  king and you've got it everywhere. But he doesn't have a Christ figure. He's got so many of them.

So if he had a Christ figure, if he had an azzle on or something like that, then it looks like a Christian  fable or a parable. Now what was your second part of your question, though? Is there any? Is there any  other works that you would know? No, but you know, there are a lot of movies when you're done with them  or plays when you're done with them.

You say, it's very obvious the person who wrote that was not a  Christian, but what they wanted to say was very important for people to hear if they're ever going  to be prepared for Christianity. And I see them all over the place. Yeah, I mean, whether or not they  actually realize that they're writing something that is for family. Yeah. You know, I used to  the first movie we had.

It was just like a scene in the hours when Virginia Woolf says to a  Virginia Woolf's husband says to her, why does somebody have to die? And the answer is so that others  will, I can't remember exactly, appreciate life more or something like that. And he says,  who has to die and she says the poet, the visionary? Yeah, there's lots of, you know,  what Lewis said that God gave the pagans good dreams. You know, and there's all sorts of clues  all through them.

You know, the Clint East would move the unforgiven. Anybody know that movie? Very violent movie, really. It's just about a guy who goes and shoots everybody. It's kind of  interesting.

At the very end, this kid sidekick who's seen all this bloodshed, do you remember this  at all? He's just chugging down some alcohol, just trying to study his nerves and he said,  all these people that we've killed, they had a common. They deserved it, right? And Clint East would  say, we all deserve to be killed. We all deserve to die.

We all deserve to be shot. You know,  which of course, from a Christian point of view is absolutely true in a way, but you know, I don't  know what I don't know was in the mind of the writer, but it's all, I mean, I know to some degree,  you actors have got to pay your dues. You've got to act. You've got to get your experience. You've  got to get to know people.

You've got to hone your skills. And very often, you're doing things  that you say, what redeeming social value is this? But on the other hand, a lot of preachers  spend a lot of time doing that in the early days, too. What am I doing for Jesus preaching here  in the middle of hot coffee, Mississippi, to 15 old ladies every Sunday? And a lot of people,  that's how you get started.

It doesn't seem like you're really changing the world. It's not a  whole lot different. So some other. Yes, I'm sorry. Go ahead.

Oh, yeah. I actually had a question. You probably already know this like in the past, like before my age, a lot of actors, like,  well, yeah, like they're excommunicated from their church for acting. And it goes back to the  whole St. Augustine thing about Mendacity and backding and all the aspects.

I just like to think  I just like to hear from you a few more examples of acting in the Bible. Would you say like  Jeremiah portraying something silently? Well, you're asking two good questions. The one question,  of course, is the church has been nasty to actors for many years. And I still have some trouble,  frankly, and I know something about church is I have a little trouble understanding the theological  justification for excluding acting and drama because I keep thinking one of the things is,  it's impossible to preach.

You don't, you know, you're preaching as a form of acting. I don't think  they know that. I mean, you, you're acting out ideas. You're acting out illustration. Sometimes  you're acting out stories.

I'm trying to figure out why they would say, I don't quite completely  understand. There's no doubt that they said you do the immoral things. Your portrayal character was  doing well. Well, yeah, you're portraying. So you're not allowed to, well, see the real, if they had  said you must never write fiction in which you're portraying people doing immoral things.

Which is,  to me, the difference is very, very small, whether you're, whether you're writing a story or acting  out a story, you are still telling a story. And what I can't quite figure out is what the theological  distinction would be between writing the screw tape letters and acting evil on a, you know, acting  like an evil character on the stage. I don't understand. I still haven't figured that out. Now, second  question, oh, in the Bible, my friend, Trevor Longman, who has written the best commentary ever  on Ecclesiastes, says the book of Ecclesiastes is almost certainly a play.

And here's how this works. He wrote his doctoral dissertation at Yale on fictional accadian autobiography,  accadian AKKADIA. And I'm not, don't write it down, but I just want to say what is this? And what he  meant is that in ancient times, in the accadians, which were contemporaries to the Jews and all that,  there was a particular form of, I guess you could say, it was a literary genre, in which in the  beginning you spoke in the first person. And you said, I'm going to tell you this story, I'm going  to do this and this and this, and I'm going to be this person, this person, and then you go into  character.

You say, now I'm this, and I'm doing this, now I'm this, and then we're doing this, now  at the end you come out again and say, now what did we learn? And if you actually look at the  book of Ecclesiastes, which is notoriously hard to outline, because in the very beginning he talks  about, you know, Solomon the King and the third person, and then he talks about I am Solomon the  King and I have seen all these riches and it means nothing to me. It's vanity, all this vanity. And  then suddenly he says, and now I have, you know, I have done learning and I have gotten all my PhDs,  and it means nothing to me. And at the very end he comes out and says, now what have we learned?

And Trempord pretty much proves by saying, this is exactly the kind of literary genre we had  in the past where it's basically one man play. Comes up and says, I'm going to do this,  and then acts it out, and then at the end says, what have we learned? And he says, it's a written  out play which could be acted out and it actually could be acted out extremely well. The other  thing is all the prophets did do acting as you have already wisely alluded to. Ezekiel was the  worst.

I mean, I'm trying to remember what they were, but I mean, Jeremiah would not just come in  and preach a sermon about the fact that you have thrown off God's yoke, he would come in wearing a  yoke. And he would say, you've thrown off God's yoke, or he would take a scroll and cut it up and  throw it in the fire as he was talking and so on. So they acted as well. The problem with saying  you shouldn't be an actor or you shouldn't do those things is that the line between fiction,  writing fiction and acting, the line between preaching and any kind of storytelling,  and then going one step further with a bring an object, you know, one step further bringing a  yoke or something. And the next, what are you doing?

I mean, I don't know how you can, where do you  draw the line? Say, that's acting and that's not. That's stage and that's not. It's impossible. And it's legalistic, frankly, whenever you try to draw lines, the Bible hasn't drawn.

So do you get a lot of it? Well, never mind. Let's keep going. Yes, go ahead. I just want to ask about drawing the line because I tend to look at the whole piece as a whole,  like you were saying, if there was any redeeming value in the in the whole story or the whole  play or whatever, and then, you know, whether that's something that wanted to participate.

Yeah. Because any character you do is going to be doing things that are not righteous and  holy, right? There wouldn't be a story. Right. So you got to have antagonists.

Right. You're going to be dramatic conflicts. You're going to, if I draw the line, there's a point  where you draw the line in terms of what I would portray and also how I view the whole piece, right? Your conscience. Now, this is the sort of thing that you should be trying to come together as actors  in a city and talk about.

And you ought to give one another. Here's how I draw the line. And here's  where I draw the line. And you need to try this out. And maybe, maybe you would develop a cumulative  wisdom that we don't have right now.

And that there might be a, you know, a couple of different theories  that guidelines that Christian actors in New York have developed about where you draw the line. But in  the end, we, we have got a Presbyterians have a confession. And there's a chapter in a confession  called Liberty of Conscience. And that confession says that you mustn't bind other people's conscience  is where the Bible hasn't. So the Bible says you can't commit adultery.

Then you just can't. I'm  sorry, I don't care what God told you. I don't care what you're, you know, you think the Spirit told  you. You can't. But as you say, I can, you know, I can do this on stage.

But I can't do that. I can  do this on stage. Common sense, I think for most Christians would be, you know, that you can't do  that. But we have to be very careful about saying, if you're a Christian, you shouldn't be doing that. Because, because Liberty of Conscience is, the Bible hasn't told me exactly where.

So we're going to  have to use, watch your conscience, do not violate your conscience. See, if you go further than your  conscience, really will let you go, because I need the job, or I want the prestige, or I want the  money, you hurt yourself pretty badly. Don't do it. Don't say, well, you know, everybody else thinks  this is all right. And I guess it's okay.

If your conscience can't bear it, don't you dare do it. It says in James, whatever you do, it's not a faith for you, it's sin. You just cannot do it. So it is important to check your conscience out. You know, you're ahead of your hand up, right?

And then, oh, is this on this? Go ahead. What about the weaker brother? Is that part of your conscience? You're talking about what other people think?

Well, you know, you're part of a community. You're part of a community. And if you find  that you're the only one that thinks it's okay to do that. And, you know, your 25 best Christian  actor friends think it's wrong. You probably ought to think twice.

What if you're just being extra sensitive to that one, or a few people that may be offended? Your artist, you're going to be sensitive. If anybody, if anybody thinks you've done wrong, and they're really disappointed in you,  is that what you mean? In other words, you do something, and you feel like, here's a person over there. It was possible for everyone to stumble.

What defines stumble? Good question. Matt at you, think you're stupid. That's not stumbling. That's true.

You're absolutely right. When the Bible says, don't call somebody to stumble. What that really means is you should not be helping someone else do something. One of the troubles is, the actual place where this happens is Jews  were eating meat off her to idols because in their culture, an idol is nothing. Many of the pagan people had become Christians.

To them, the idols were really a big deal. They had worshipped them and so on. When they saw Jews eating meat off her to idols,  and it didn't bother them, the Gentiles said, I guess I can, and when they did it,  they felt cut off from God and terrible and all that. Paul said, what you're doing is encouraging  somebody else to do something that they just can't do in faith and don't do it, but I'm not quite  sure what that would be here. Be careful.

Stumbling doesn't just mean offend somebody,  or even upset them. Well, I can dance if that may be hard for some people who have issues  watching dance. Fine. Right. I mean, you do know from culture to culture, what is considered  authoritarian in one culture is considered, you know, is considered sort of a normal exercise  authority in what one culture, I mean, it's not what one culture considers a lascivious  another culture doesn't.

So you do ultimately, you do have to beg one another, not to try to  bind people's consciences where the Bible's left them free and just say, you know, I beg you,  if this bothers you, or if you can't do this, if it gets into your heart to be kissing somebody  for eight weeks in a row, then just don't do it. Follow your conscience. But then respect each other's  consciences. Don't say, oh, you know, you're weakling or what's the matter with you. You're not  professional.

What's the matter? Can't you be detached? Nor do the opposite and say, look at that  person who's clearly going into sin, but keep in touch with each other and ask each other,  are you really able to do that? You had your hand up, right? I'm going to go.

The Catholics right now are vastly better at supporting artists than evangelical Christians,  way, way, way past. I mean, yeah, they may have burned a few of you at the stake over the years,  but you know, come on, get, you know, let's buy gospel, buy gospel. But they were actually good. Actually, Flannery O'Connor wrote a great book called Mystery in Manors that is wonderful. It's mainly for writers, but you'd learn a lot from it.

I haven't over here. Yes, go ahead. Let me get just three of you over here. Yes, go ahead. I've seen opera now, but I started out  wanting to be an actress, and one of the things that I faced was that people at church felt that  I was only seeking glory for myself.

And I was wondering what your thoughts are on how we can  project what attitude we should have as artists and what attitude, how can we help people? If you were singing the church, that'd be different. Well, as if you're singing in the church, that's not seeking glory for yourself. I mean, think about this. I mean, have any of you ever been inquires?

Do you think there's any people inquires around the country that are seeking glory for themselves now? What about preachers? Do you think there's any preachers? I mean, everybody who's up front  is God of the danger of seeking glory for themselves. I think just what you have to say, of course,  it's a huge danger, but we don't have any more, say we have the same amount of danger of that  that the ministers do or the Christian singers do.

So nevertheless, after you  have dealt with that problem, it is a problem, by the way. I mean, you know, I have to say,  why am I really doing this? If I hone certain skills that are like acting to some degree,  I hone certain skills. It's sort of preaching as a combination. In some ways, I've got to be a good  writer.

In some ways, I've got to be a good actor. And if I hone those skills and people come out to  listen to me, you've come out to listen to me, why am I doing that? I mean, I've got the same problem  you do. I mean, it's no different. It's a big problem.

But just because you want to be an artist  or an opera singer and actor doesn't mean you've got a bigger problem than anybody else, that's all. I would not say to a Christian, oh, you can't. Again, the conscience, very important. Where is the totalization line getting drawn here? I mean, you know, there's some stuff you say  obvious.

Everybody knows, you know, there's, you know, full frontal nudity. And I mean,  there's some things to say, okay, so we start where we all agree you're not going to do. But then  what happens is as we go, what about this? What about this show? What about this show?

Next thing you  know, we're divided. Somebody say, well, I don't have a problem with that. And somebody say, we  have those conversations. And then please respect each other's decisions. And over a generation,  you could become wise as a Christian community and come to more consensus and work the thing out.

Just don't freak out over somebody. There's always somebody to your left and somebody to your right. There's always somebody who thinks you're the liberal, you know, or you're the sell-out, or there's  somebody who thinks you're the moralist, you're the legalist. I generally feel that you, like I  said, just like ministers, you gotta, you gotta take roles that at least, me, you gotta do some  things that at least are probably useless. You know, they're useless to society.

They don't really  do much of anything. I just want stuff that is really, you know, really, there is plenty of stuff  out there that is just trying to pull away traditional values. It's just after it. They're just  trying to do it. I don't want to be part of that.

But how do we know that ones there and there  talk about it with each other? Try to draw lines. You're not going to figure this out overnight. You're not going to figure out overnight. The younger you are, the more you're likely you are to do  things that you just, you know, you feel a little bad in the conscience, but I think you can do it,  but watch it and talk to each other about it.

And don't and don't violate your conscience very much. You know, once, once you know you violated it back out, when you're not sure, sometimes I can't tell  I violated it till I try and then I realize I'm over the line. Let's keep going. Yes, sure. Do I work hard?

Do I push, you know, and that element of saying, hey,  about I know you're in control of this and trusting him and then doing my part as well in terms of  what business aspect of this. And that really plus any question, but simply for acting. Well, you know, the problem with acting is that you don't get nearly as much negative. There's almost no  other career where you get so much negative assessment. You just don't get turned down.

I mean,  it's just nuts. You know, once a year, you can take a job in one of these high rates,  once a year, you sit down, you get a performance evaluation and they say, well, you're not doing  very well. Or maybe even we're going to fire you if you don't stop this and it's, you know,  and then six months later they fire you. That's a lot better than being an actor where you get all  these turn downs and being ignored. It's pretty tough.

So I, and actually I really do think it's  because of that a lot, as you all know, I guess your community is filled with people who have a lot of  a lot of emotional well fragility. Yeah, really emotionally fragile, which doesn't surprise me. I don't think I'm not sure you're emotionally fragile and therefore you want to be an actor. I think you're an actor and next thing you know, you're like, you know, but so you do need that,  but nevertheless, with any career, you have to say, when have I, should I be pushing harder,  is that why I'm not getting any further? And when do I give up and try something else?

But on the other hand, when I was in seminary, there was seminaries that train ministers,  they don't care whether you're gifted or called or going to be any good, they just didn't want  your tuition. So they're putting you through and halfway through or at the end, people are saying,  I want to be a minister and almost everybody can look and say, that person's never going to be a  minister. A person doesn't have what it takes, but nobody told them about that. So actually I  spent a good deal of time because some of you heard me do this before. I came up with a,  with a three, a tripod called Ability Affinity Opportunity and Ability means you're good and other  people think you're good.

Affinity means I'm really passionate. I love it. Opportunity means God  opens the doors. And you might say, how do I know whether or not I'm, you can't mess up your life. You can't.

Just the other day, somebody called me and said, I listened to sermon by somebody and  they seemed to indicate that the reason I'm not married is because I'm not praying enough. Okay. And I want to be married and I'm not praying enough. And so is the reason I'm not married  because I'm not praying enough and therefore I'm, I'm sinning. I said, well, you know, Jacob's  sinned.

He dressed up as he saw and he ruined his whole family and created all, you know, I just  really screwed everything up. And God used the sin to find him the family that God wanted him to have. He wouldn't had, he wouldn't have found the family wouldn't had the children. It was all through  the sin. So I said, what, what about your theory that the reason my life's not going the way  God wants it is because maybe I'm sinning.

I personally think God is so sovereign that if you sin,  if you do something wrong, there's going to be devastation in your life for a long time and it's  your fault. And yet if you sin and if you're his child and he loves you, then all those promises  are going to come to you anyway and he'll bring his blessing into your life through the sin. Now, you know, you'll spend all your life wishing you hadn't done it and you shouldn't have done it. But he's, you can't mess up your life. So don't, just don't kill yourself trying to be successful  if he's just don't.

However, if after a period of time, and I don't know how long to tell people  to wait, the affinity, ability and opportunity don't come together. There's some people who want to  do it and everybody says they can do it and the opportunity is just don't come. You're just never  the right person at the right place in the right time with the right cheekbone structure. You know how that works. You know, it has not, you know, so often it has has absolutely nothing to do  with talent, just that I'm looking for somebody your size, the your cheekbone structure, you know,  the way you wink, you know, that's the way that we want.

And next thing, you know, the career is made. You know, if that will make you a Calvinist, I don't know what will. I don't know what will. So, well, if the opportunity doesn't come, or if you, you know, unless they all come together at once  and after you've knocked and knocked and knocked and knocked, then don't be afraid that somehow you have  failed to, you've met, mucked up your life that God wanted you to be an actor and now you can't be  because you didn't try hard enough, just relax a little bit. So, in some ways, you are where everybody  else is, but I think it is mostly harder to stay at acting long term if you just don't have those  doors open.

Other people can work a lot longer at their job before they say, I'm going to try something  else. So, you do need to support each other, but in the end, I think acting, actually, most people  I know who've been actors who go do something else, it enriches their ability to do a lot of other  things. Don't think, I put all this time into it, almost almost anything else you do. Presentation  is very important and your ability to do presentation and to know how to do presenting to people will  stand you in good stead for a long time.

### 中文翻译

今天在播客中，Tim Keller 帮助我们理解：福音如何释放我们，使我们在职业呼召中有盼望与喜乐。这是一篇讲道，推进得很好，高潮也很漂亮。不过接下来其实是一串随想。这之后的问答，你们也许从中得到的收获比我现在讲的还多；但我认为，若你是基督徒，你需要知道：做演员的理由是什么？你知道，为什么基督徒要当演员？

为什么基督徒要当演员？从基督教的角度来看，演员做的事到底有什么价值？这就是我想谈的。所以我说，我对此有一系列的随想。不过让我先从《纽约时报》里给你们读一段。

我注意到，舞者和编舞家 Bill T. Jones 等人，正在推出一个新作品，是根据 Flannery O'Connor 的一篇短篇小说改编的。更有意思的是，这里有一段 Bill T. Jones 的采访。

他说：“我对布什政府气得要命。我不喜欢这个国家的那种原教旨主义传统。”他就像一个典型的纽约世俗自由派一样，在那里怒骂、咆哮。然而，他却被 Flannery O'Connor 的短篇小说完全迷住了。他直说，他被震撼得不行。

他说，那些是“最好的短篇小说”。他想把它们——至少其中一篇——搬上舞台。引人注意的是，第一，这些故事——他选用的那一篇——非常、非常直白地带着基督教色彩。故事讲的是：一个祖父和一个孙子住在佐治亚州偏僻的乡下，大概是三十年代或四十年代。那孩子开始变得自以为是、摆架子。

于是祖父说：“我要带他进亚特兰大，因为他想去大城市。”那孩子几乎从没见过自来水，也几乎什么都没见过。祖父说：不让你去大城市，除非你先去把它看够了；然后你就会知道，大城市也没什么了不起。

他把孩子带进城，可不幸的是，孩子喜欢上了自己所看到的，越发变得“摆架子”。后来有一次，孩子在打盹时，祖父干脆把他丢下，自己跑开，转到拐角处躲起来，只为吓唬他、给他一个教训——非常刻薄。另外，显然在整个故事里，祖父到处都表现出一种极其“真实”、却非常卑劣的种族主义态度。所以你一点也不会喜欢他。

当他丢下孙子、把孙子吓坏后，发生了一件可怕的事：孩子在拥挤的人群中一边尖叫“爷爷在哪里”，一边狂奔，把一个女人撞倒了。警察来了，问这是谁家的孩子。祖父因为从没与警察打过交道而吓坏了，竟然否认这孩子，否认自己是孩子的祖父，就这么走开了。于是两人之间出现了可怕的裂痕。最后，以一种非常耐人寻味、也很迷人的方式，孩子原谅了祖父。Bill T. Jones 直说：这点令他着迷。

接着他讲到这故事的结尾。他说，Flannery O'Connor 是一个“毫不讽刺（non-ironic）”的天主教信徒；她是非常坚定的基督徒天主教信徒。以下是 Bill T. Jones 的原话。

他说：她相信有一种东西叫“恩典”，而恩典有时会在我们最“卑劣”的时候，正中我们的眉心。现在，她和我在这点上也许意见不同——他不认同这个基本观念。并且，虽然 O'Connor 似乎建立了许多我未必同意的关联，但我所知道的是：这是一则极其有力、震撼人心的故事，所以我想把它搬上舞台。事实上，它是这样结尾的。

他刚刚说过它有多么直白地带着基督教色彩。顺带一提，那位祖父名叫 Mr. Head。结尾写道：Mr. Head 一动不动地站着，感到怜悯的作为触摸了他——因为在最后，孩子原谅了他，说：“我们回家吧。”

结尾继续说：他感到怜悯的作为触摸了他，但这一次他知道，世上没有任何词语能为它命名。他明白，怜悯是从痛苦中长出来的；这种痛苦无人能免，却以奇异的方式赐给孩子。他明白，这几乎是一个人能带进死亡、献给造物主的唯一东西；而他忽然羞愧得发烫，因为自己带着去的怜悯竟是那么少。他惊惧地站着，用上帝那般彻底的标准审判自己；而怜悯的作为像火焰一样覆盖他的骄傲，并将其吞噬。他从未把自己看作大罪人，但此刻他看见：他的真正败坏一直对他隐藏着，免得他因此手下留情。

他意识到：从时间的起初——从他在自己心里孕育亚当之罪——直到如今他否认可怜的 Nelson（那是他的孙子）之时，他的罪都被赦免了。他看见 Nelson 对他来说“太过可憎”，以至于他不敢认作自己的人；而既然上帝的爱与赦免成正比，他在那一刻觉得自己已经准备好进入乐园。Bill T. Jones 正在把这段搬上舞台。为什么？因为这是一个讲得极其出色的故事。

这不是一篇论文——他原本完全可以写一篇论文来阐述：为什么有上帝、我们是有罪的、上帝按着我们的罪赦免我们；并且，只有当我们明白自己是罪人时，我们才会转向并得着怜悯；因此，我们越知道自己有多糟，就越得着怜悯。

换句话说，他本可以写那篇论文，而 Bill T. Jones 连看都不会看一眼，甚至不会把它翻过来；但这是一则故事。有一次，有人问 Flannery O'Connor：“我想明白我多年前读到的这个故事，它太精彩了。你能不能用一句话概括它是什么意思？就一两句话，概括一下？”

你们知道她怎么回答吗？很有名。她说：“如果我能用一句话把它给你，我就不必写这个故事了。如果我能用两句话告诉你，我就不必写这个故事了。”那么，演员是什么？

作家和演员是有区别的。演员就像耶稣使道成肉身：他们把一个看不见的故事变成可见的。你知道，耶稣是道成了肉身；那里有“道”，但它是看不见的，而他把它活出来、把它体现出来。

演员所做的，是讲故事，但不只是讲故事；他们把故事“体现”出来。当然，你几乎不可能在完全不“表演”的情况下讲一个故事——总会有某种程度的表演——但你们是在把故事具象化。人需要故事；而故事几乎是改变人的世界观、改变人对事物理解的最佳方式。这正是你们所做的。

现在让我退后一点，给你们几个随想——我说“随想”，并不完全随机，因为它们彼此有些逻辑关联——谈谈故事是什么，以及为什么故事有那样的影响力。

第一，什么是故事？你可能觉得奇怪：我读过对“故事”最好的定义，竟然是在《哈佛商业评论》里。有两三位好莱坞编剧写了一篇文章，因为《哈佛商业评论》在说：CEO 试图说服人的时候，愚蠢地使用图表和数字，只给你事实和数据。他们说：那并不会改变人的想法。

那也不会激励人。你需要讲一个故事。而 MBA 学校对故事是什么几乎一无所知。所以他们说：故事是什么？有三点。

第一（或者说从某种角度是两点）：有一件事把生活“打破平衡”。除非有什么东西把生活弄得失衡，你就没有故事。比如经典例子：“小红帽给外婆送点心”——这是一条原则，是一个事实。

它像一张图表，不是故事。但“小红帽去给外婆送点心，可是大灰狼已经吃了外婆，正躺在床上等她”——这就是故事。因为有什么东西把生活弄得失衡了。

接着，因为生活失衡了——关于这点多年来已经写下了大量文字——你就会有“主角”和“反派”。主角（protagonist）这个词字面是“为争斗者”——你为某件事而挣扎；反派（antagonist）就是“反争斗者”。主角试图把生活重新拉回平衡。

反派则是那些反对你的人，或那些反对你的力量，想阻止你把它恢复平衡。没有主角与反派，就没有故事。我说这点多年来有很多讨论；一会儿我会告诉你：几乎从自由派到保守派都意识到，故事之所以如此有力，是因为人不可能在不把事情放进“情节线”的情况下，为任何事赋予意义。而没有任何情节线是不包含：某种失衡、某些人努力把它恢复平衡、以及某些人反对他们——对吧？没有某种形式的“好人”和“坏人”，你就没有故事。

人们对此很不安的原因是：如果你无法在没有故事的情况下赋予意义；而故事又总是带着主角与反派；那么你就无法在不把世界分成好人和坏人的情况下，给任何事赋予意义。每一种帮助你组织现实的“主叙事”（master story）都必须有——引用他们的话——“那个他者（the Other，大写 O）”：某个被我们视为坏人的对象。而这正是当今世界的问题之一。若你愿意，之后可以再问我。

所以，故事就是：某件事打破平衡；主角对抗反派、试图把它恢复平衡；第三，你可以说，故事的结局是“任务成功还是失败”。故事不一定有快乐结局；它们可以有暧昧结局，甚至可以像前卫作品那样“没有结局”——当然，那很酷、很先锋——不把它结束。

但问题在于：即使你不让故事结束，即使你不让它以快乐结局结束，你仍然知道它本该结束，或你知道它还没有结束。因为你知道故事是有结局的。所以也许那故事、那剧、那电影并没有告诉你它如何结束，但你知道它应该有一个结束。这就是故事。第一点我已经说了：这就是故事是什么。

第二，我已经暗示过：你不可能在不把事情放进一条情节线的情况下，为任何事赋予意义。我最喜欢的例子就是 9·11。存在一个自由派的情节线。

自由派的情节线是：美国是世界上的坏人；受压迫者和穷人是好人。也存在一个保守派的情节线：美国是好人；我们相信民主，我们是好人；而外面有各种极权，各种……你知道的，低智商、以及各种其他人。所以我们是好人，他们是坏人——与自由派相反。

那么当 9·11 发生时，人们怎么做？有人说：“你看，他们恨我们，是因为我们这么大、这么坏。”保守派说：“你看，他们恨我们，是因为我们这么好；现在我们必须做点什么。”

换句话说，他们立刻说：“这意味着我们必须发动反恐战争。”自由派则说：“这意味着我们必须承认我们在世界上做了什么，为什么人们恨我们。”他们把事件拿来，若不把它放进一个情节线里，就无法理解它。

而最好的一条情节线，其实是 Giuliani 和 Pataki 提出的。他们说：这场悲剧可以使我们的城市更强大。如果我们团结起来，我们能做到，我们能做到。所以他们把它放进了另一条情节线。但没有人能在不把它放进情节线的情况下谈论这件事；没有人能只给你事实。

你无法理解任何事；你无法为任何事赋予意义，除非你把它放进一个叙事里。你看报纸、看戏剧：每个故事背后都假设“生活本来应该是某种样子”；有什么东西把它弄得失衡；这些人正在努力让它恢复平衡；而这些人反对他们。

首先，这意味着：除非你有一个“主叙事”，否则你无法为自己的人生赋予意义。有些人说：我的主叙事是——我出身非常卑微、甚至有虐待背景；我要从那里走出来，做出一番事业。这就是他们的叙事。对另一些人来说，是寻找真爱。

毫无疑问，那就是他们的叙事。对另一些人来说：我是一个自由灵魂的艺术家，我要让世界对像我这样的自由灵魂艺术家更安全；而那些压迫性的、传统的人，才是世界之所以糟糕的原因。每个人都有一条叙事，借此他们在说：“我的人生意味着什么。”

这在那本书里（如果你们有人读过那本书，我会推荐给你们——给 Luan）也会说到。那本书说：每个人都有一个世界观；你无法在没有一种“宏观故事视角”的情况下运作——也就是你认为“世界的故事是什么”。换句话说，当你看向世界，很明显世界并非它应该的样子；有什么东西把世界弄得失衡了：贫穷不是好事。

战争不是好事。种族主义不是好事。你知道，心理问题也不是好事。世界到底哪里出了问题？我们要如何把它纠正？

所以，马克思有一个看法。他把资产阶级妖魔化，也把生产资料的所有者妖魔化。他说：基本上，国家控制经济就会带来改变。弗洛伊德也有一套。每个人都有一套。

佛教徒说：真正的问题是个人的意识——你以为自己是一个独立的自我，却没有看见自己是“整体灵魂”的一部分。柏拉图和希腊人说：真正的问题是物质世界，以及它如何拖拽你。每个人都说：这个就是反派，这个就是敌对者。

这就是问题所在；而你必须这样做才能把它纠正。每个人都有这些。他们把它称为“世界观”。无论你是谁，你都无法在没有世界观的情况下生活。

但世界观其实就是一则“主叙事”：你认为世界哪里出了问题；谁站在正确的一边要把它修复；谁站在错误的一边；谁在反对修复；以及我们必须做什么。

现在，这对基督徒意味着什么？当然，与作家或其他艺术家不同，演员最大的问题是：一般来说（除非你们当中有人也这样做），你是在把别人写的故事演出来，把别人的故事体现出来。你也许会说：作为基督徒，我从不在我觉得“很基督教、带着基督教信息”的故事里表演。

但请你想一想：基督教的主叙事是什么？我们认为世界的故事是什么？我们认为主要问题是什么？我们认为“主叙事”是什么？

让我用一句话概括：一切受造起初都是好的，但一切都因罪而堕落；一切都因罪而破碎；而借着基督，一切都要被救赎。现在让我告诉你这意味着什么。

希腊式世界观说：身体是坏的，灵魂是好的。佛教式世界观说：灵性是好的，但物质现实是幻象。马克思可能会说：资本家是坏的，无产阶级是好的。许多保守派会说正相反：无产者、“乌合之众”才是我们要提防的。

你知道，有霍布斯对比洛克。每个人都说：世界的问题在这里。基督教故事拒绝把任何一件受造之物妖魔化。我们绝不会说身体坏、灵魂好，因为我们相信身体和灵魂都同样有罪。

它们都被罪玷污了。世界的问题是罪，不是这个群体对那个群体，不是文化对自然或自然对文化之类。基督教世界观既不妖魔化任何单一事物，也不把任何事物偶像化。你知道，在马克思主义里，有些人似乎永远不会错，有些人似乎永远不会对。

但每一种世界观都倾向于用黑白分明来涂抹现实，因为主角总是这些人，反派总是那些人。

若你相信基督教的情节线：你是罪人；你并不是好人。而外面那些不是基督徒的人，他们仍然是按着上帝形像被造的；他们并不是真正的坏人。基督徒拥有的故事，是所有故事中最细腻、最有层次的故事。我们应该最慢把白帽子给某些人、把黑帽子给另一些人。

对我们来说，也应该最容易进入几乎任何人的故事——不管它出自何种世界观——并说：“是的，我明白。”比如说，因为我们相信人的身体每一部分都是堕落的，人的人格每一部分都是堕落的：如果你遇到一个故事谈论性行为的危险，没问题；但如果你遇到一个故事真正高举性的美好，那也可以。

你看，我们不像佛教徒或希腊人那样，把性视为一种诱惑、因为他们厌恶物质世界。我们认为性是好事；我们认为上帝创造了物质世界，而耶稣也有一个物质的身体。

因此，基督徒应当能在几乎任何其他故事里找到自己故事的元素。当然，有些故事你不该去演，因为它们在故意抬举最糟糕的东西，并加以赞美。但一般来说，我认为基督徒演员应当能在许多其他故事里找到表演的好理由——因为别人的故事往往讲到了基督教故事的一部分；而基督教故事如此全面。

一切都是好的，一切受造起初都是好的，所以没有什么是你连看都不该看的；但一切也都堕落了，所以没有什么是你应该绝对抬举、当作偶像的。因此，几乎任何揭示“某件事的问题”的故事都是可能的；几乎任何揭示“某件事的美好”的故事也是可能的。它们都是基督教故事的一部分。

最后一点，然后我们就开始提问。

现阶段，你们几乎必须在别人的故事里演出。但如果你将来有机会把自己的故事写出来并演出来：我发现，关于传福音有一件事很有意思。我渐渐意识到：我年轻的时候，人们说“这就是你分享信仰的方法”，然后给我一些大纲——各种大纲。让我快速举一个这些大纲的问题。

我父母那一代（他们现在八十多岁），在美国成长，经历大萧条与二战。他们那一代在某种意义上有一个文化叙事、一个主要的文化故事：人生最重要的不是你相信什么，而是你是个好人——一个真正的好人：你正派、诚实、对家庭好、勤奋。这就是他们的文化叙事。

而我的孩子们现在二十出头，我看他们属于另一个世代。他们的文化叙事不是“最重要的是做个好人”；对他们来说，最重要的是“自由”——自由地做真正的自己，不被任何东西奴役、不被任何东西压迫、不被任何东西控制。若你对我孩子那一代说：“最重要的是做个好人。”他们会说：“那也太……（to find good）。”

如果你对我父母那一代这么说，没有人会那样回应。

那么，福音是什么？你可以说“耶稣为你的罪死了”，是的，当然；但什么是“罪”？你必须把恩典与罪连接起来；你必须把基督教故事与当下世代的基础文化叙事连接起来。

所以，比如对年长的人，我会说——我现在仍然这样说——你以为自己是好人，但你其实不够好；你在这些方面都跌倒；只有借着耶稣，你才能被赦免。但对我孩子那一代，我会说：你以为自己是自由的，但你其实并不自由。

因为只要你把任何不是耶稣基督的东西放在生命中心，你就会成为那东西的奴隶；因此，只有借着基督你才会得自由。

顺带一提，圣经里很有意思：保罗有一次说，“犹太人要的是能力，希腊人要的是智慧；但我传给他们的是基督——上帝的能力、上帝的智慧，虽然在他们看来是愚拙、软弱的。”他在说什么？

他要说的是：希腊人是知识分子，他们真正看重的是哲学、理解、理性。犹太人更务实，他们想知道“怎么运作”，他们要能力，要结果。

他对他们传基督的方式并不一样。一方面，他挑战犹太人的故事——他们的基础文化叙事——说：耶稣基督在你看来像疯了一样，因为他以软弱而来，一个软弱的弥赛亚挂在十字架上；但那其实正是你一直在寻找的力量。另一方面，他对希腊人说了不同的话：耶稣基督是“愚拙”的。

也就是说，他没有受过你们那种教育，他没有上对学校，他没写过任何书；然而，他却拥有你一直在寻找的真正智慧。换句话说，保罗想说的是：只有在耶稣基督里，任何群体、世代、社会的基础文化叙事，才会有一个美好的结局。

你的社会想要什么——智慧也好、能力也好、自由也好、良善也好——无论他们想要什么，只有在耶稣里才会有美好结局；否则它会自我毁灭。

因为它会把一个不够格的东西变成主角的英雄；又把某个原本美好、被造（虽已堕落）的东西变成恶棍，变成反派，变成偶像。

所以我要说：如果你明白基督徒的故事，而你基本上又是讲故事的人（演员就是如此），从长远看，基督教如此全面，以至于你应当能够欣赏并参与别人的故事，同时知道：你其实是在把真理带进人们的生命——无论是你在演，还是他们在看。

而最终，我认为很重要的是：真正投入、深深进入我们自己文化的故事里，好让我们理解它们，并最终把基督带进其中。

如果你不进入文化，不进入文化的故事，当你谈耶稣时，你的话就会这样“从他们身边掠过”，因为你在回答他们根本没问的问题。

因为归根到底，福音是：上帝通过一个故事拯救你，而不是通过一堆原则。上帝并没有带着一堆原则出现，说：“你若做这些，就会上天堂。”发生的是：上帝借着耶稣基督进入世界，并借着他所做的事拯救你。他通过一个故事拯救你——当然，是一个真实的故事——而不是通过“你只要顺从、去教会、遵守规条”。

救恩是通过一个故事；而这个故事如此全面，它容纳并解决所有其他故事。

所以我知道这听起来有点“炸裂”、有点夸张——其实并不夸张。我完全相信这一点；但另一方面，我也知道这内容很大，需要消化。

所以请你们：在我讲得不清楚的地方，在你们希望我展开的地方，在我其实讲得完全让人摸不着头脑的地方——请举手，我们就开始聊我刚刚讲过的内容。好，就从这边开始。对演员来说，“圣洁”的问题怎么办？

因为即便是在一些最好的故事里，他们也会被要求做一些事，比如亲吻一个不是自己配偶的男人或女人；或者在某些场景里要脱衣服；甚至要演出欲望或残忍，要表现这些情绪。这似乎违背圣洁，因为圣经里并没有给我们这方面清晰的标准。你知道，使徒们从来不是演员；看起来他们也不会把自己置于那种会让自己如此容易跌入罪中的处境里。等一下——你的意思是：你是在“演出”罪，但并没有真的“行”那个罪？

你是什么意思？也就是说，如果你在舞台上演出一些在现实里做就是错的事，但你并没有真的在做——还是你其实在做？

比如说，你结婚了，但你必须每天亲同一个人，每周八场。那可能会让你对那个人产生某种欲望。那就别做。就是这样。

你必须在这方面认识自己。你知道，C. S. Lewis 的《地狱来鸿》（Screwtape Letters），对吧？顺带一提，John Cleese——你们知道 John Cleese 是谁吗？

John Cleese（虽然我听说现在不太容易买到了）朗读过其中一些选段，非常好笑。他很棒。不过那本书是：一个高级恶魔写给一个初级恶魔的信，教它如何试探人。在序言里，Lewis 说了一段很有意思的话：写这本书很难。

也就是说，为了写这本书，他必须想象自己是邪恶的——这倒不算太难。他还引用了《申命记》里的一句话：“我的心使我认识恶人的道路。”因为他说：由于他是中世纪文学教授，有些评论者说，这本书之所以对罪、试探、诱惑的描写如此真实，显然是基于 Lewis 教授对中世纪道德哲学和天主教会相关文献的掌握。

Lewis 说：其实不然。他说：“我的心使我认识恶人的道路。”

他说：我基本上是通过进入自己的内心——那些邪恶、肮脏的东西——来写出 Screwtape 所做的那些恶事。但他说：到某个地步我必须停下来。因为，靠想象它——他说——某个时候我真的觉得自己快要窒息了，于是我停了。

你看，他连写那本书都得这样。你会不会说：“哦，他不该写”？他不能不谨慎就写。因为那种写作几乎与灵修相反：灵修是让你触及自己最好的一面，去煽旺圣灵在你里面所做的工作；而如果你要扮演一个邪恶的人、一个坏人——他在写作里也是虚构角色——基本上是同一回事。

他发现有一个界限：到了那里他就说，我必须停下来，因为我正在触碰我自己里面本不该有的部分。所以我会说：你必须非常谨慎；但这并不意味着你永远不该描绘罪或邪恶。

圣经也描绘罪，圣经里有可怕的事。我想大多数人会说：我可以演一个圣经故事，对吧？你难道不想把圣经故事演出来吗？但总得有人来演圣经故事里的恶人。至少——你可以说——这是在服事真理、把真理告诉人。但总得有人做。要看守自己的心。

我只知道，有些人能抽离得很好，确实不受伤害。现在，我对“方法派表演”（method acting）也略知一二——那已经过时了吗，还是没有？

没有过时。对我来说，“我知道得足够多，所以我能把它演出来”，和“我希望你去恨，我要你心里充满恨；你要演恨，所以我希望你真的去恨；我希望你恨台上的那个人”——这两者差别很大。我觉得那已经不是表演了，抱歉。

表演的意思是：你要看起来像某种你其实不是的样子。你看，有 John Wayne（我之前讲过）——有些人靠那种东西赚了很多钱，却根本不需要表演。还有几个我能叫出名字但我就不点名了。他们显然没有在表演，他们只是上台，把自己的情绪释放出来，做他们想做的事。

不知为何，人们愿意花钱看。但我认为真正的表演是：我应该演得像在恨，但我并不真的去恨。我当然知道有些表演教练会要你真的去恨。我也不知道该怎么说——你就笑一笑。

坦白说，我甚至不确定你怎么可能真的做到那样；我甚至怀疑那是否可能。所以要小心。

抱歉，我该让其他问题上来，但这是个很好的问题。

据估计，我们大多数人把清醒时间的一半花在工作上。圣经的智慧如何应用到我们的职业上？换句话说，我们的工作如何与上帝的工作相连？我们的职业如何变得更……（更有意义/更有使命感）？在他的书《Every Good Endeavor》（《每一份善工》）中，Tim Keller 结合几十年来关于职业与呼召的教导，向你展示如何在工作中找到真正的喜乐。

继续吧，Max。对。你对你们事工在其中第二部分的角色有什么异象吗？

我完全支持。具体怎么做？没有。当然，谁知道呢？我都没意识到——救世军两年前是什么时候……？

是啊，你知道 Ray Kroc（麦当劳创始人）吧？报纸上有写，你看见了吗？他（的）遗孀最近给救世军捐了 15 亿美元。对。嗯，是的——他们想在 25 个社区建立社区中心，这是一大笔钱。

谁知道呢？我不确定他们期望用这笔钱做什么，但如果他们在建造、如果他们能建小剧场之类的，那就——是的——太好了。

你看 Flannery O'Connor——我在这里是因为读了那篇文章、读了那篇短篇小说之后就在想：到底是什么吸引了 Bill T. Jones？很明显，他自己也说他对基督教是敌对的。

他一点也不喜欢基督教，但他却被这故事之精彩所震撼。我想：这不是很好吗？我们没有多少当代基督徒能写出那么好的故事——那种能把人吸进去的故事，因为他们感受到其中的真实，尽管理智上——我是说理智上——他们并不相信基督教教义。但问题在于：故事会从雷达下方飞过，直接击中他们的想象。

圣经说，人里面有对上帝的知识（罗马书 1 章），说人用不义压制真理；人里面确实有对上帝的知识。而故事能在那个层面触及人，坦白说。

所以我会说，这需要时间。我们甚至没有足够多的基督徒去尝试；而且似乎要成千上万的人去尝试，才能有少数几个人真正“突破”、真正打中。所以我们需要更多人尝试。当然，我完全支持。我很认真；只是我不能再更具体地说会发生什么。我愿意听建议。我相信你们都准备好给我一些。

还有别的问题？是的，请。

你能不能谈谈：如何把基督教叙事深深织进作品的肌理里，就像你在《法律与种族》（the law of the race）里那样？

是的。换句话说，我没提这一点，是因为我总以为——我认为——演员其实都想成为作家，对吧？你们想把自己的东西写出来。还有，这不是你问题的一部分：有没有哪些戏剧、电影之类，你会举为很好的例子——它不是表面上那种“基督教戏”，但却做到了这种深植？哦，有的。

你知道，我得调动我的“记忆磁带”。是的。问题是：第一，我同意你，甚至我说完之后我还是同意——不错，我竟然还能同意自己一年前说的话——我认为很多基督徒在讲基督教故事时犯的一个错误，就是没有把叙事深埋在文化形式之中。

对我来说，Tolkien 的高明之处就在这里。他是古英语（Anglo-Saxon）教授；在他全盛时期，他可能是世界上三四个最懂古英语、哥特语、冰岛语、芬兰语，以及北欧异教史前根源的人之一。他做的事是：他看见并说——你知道吗，比如北欧神话？

你知道 “Götterdämmerung（诸神黄昏）”是什么吗？你会说：哦，那是 Wagner 的东西。但你知道，在北欧神话里，“最终的末日”（某种意义上的末世、哈米吉多顿）是：历世历代的诸神与英雄复活，与怪物、食人魔、恶魔以及一切恶人作战。在某个平原上有一场巨大的战斗，决定谁将赢得未来永恒的世界。

而诸神与英雄战死。这就叫诸神黄昏——诸神的黄昏。好人失败。历史将如此走向终局。

而盎格鲁-撒克逊、北欧世界观是：没关系，因为“高贵”就在于——即使你知道你将走向无尽的失败，你仍然要做善。这就是他们所谓的高贵。

英雄面前有“高贵的厄运”（a high doom）：我将做对的事。其实很有意思：如果你读过《十字架之梦》（The Dream of the Rood，一首古英语诗），它是基督教诗，因为基督教后来传来；他们被耶稣基督上十字架的观念深深吸引——那就是高贵。知道做正确的事意味着走向可怕的失败。

这进入了盎格鲁-撒克逊世界，某种程度上“进来”了。基督教所说的、与北欧世界的悲观并不是完全正面冲撞；北欧的悲观遇上了基督教的乐观，悲观被改变了。但关于高贵、英雄主义、勇气、即便死也要做对的事——这部分并没有被消灭，而是被救赎了。

现在，Tolkien 试图想象：盎格鲁-撒克逊的神话本该是什么样子——这些几乎全都失传了，因为那些说法语的肮脏诺曼人跨海而来，在黑斯廷斯战役之后把盎格鲁-撒克逊文化抹掉了。

我们几乎只剩下大约 45 页的盎格鲁-撒克逊古代文学，其余都消失了。所以 Tolkien 说：我想象那全部神话会是什么样子。我想象出来，但它必须是“前基督教”的；可是我是基督徒。因此我要做的是：想象一个前基督教的神话，但把其中许多悲观清洗掉。

是的，即便你读《指环王》，它依然很悲伤；它是一部很悲伤的作品。他想保留那份悲伤，也想保留一种观念：你无法在不失去某些东西的情况下赢得胜利——你至少会失去与你所赢得的一样多的东西。他保留了这一点，因为他爱那份悲伤，也觉得那是……他认为那是基督教的。

他所写的是前基督教的东西，那是“共同恩典”（common grace），那是“普遍启示”（general revelation），是即便他们还不是基督徒时也临到他们的启示——那是真理。

所以他努力进入那些古老神话中，保留其中的真理，并从基督教视角把它稍微提升、增强一点。等一切结束时，他是极好的例子：因为在《指环王》里，没有任何公开的基督教、宗教，甚至“上帝”的指涉。但当你读完，你会觉得被洁净了。

你读完会说：我读到了一件圣洁的东西。我被它洁净了。怎么会这样？因为他把叙事、情节线深埋了。于是你有复活的“主”甘道夫，有受苦仆人弗罗多，有归来的君王阿拉贡——到处都是。

但他没有只放一个“基督形象”，他放了很多。如果他只放一个明确的基督形象，比如 Aslan 那样，那么它就会看起来像一则基督教寓言或比喻。

你问的第二部分是什么？还有没有其他作品我知道？我现在一时想不出具体的名字。但有许多电影或戏剧，你看完会觉得：写它的人显然不是基督徒，但他想说的东西对人非常重要——如果人将来要准备好接受基督教，就必须先听见这些。我到处都能看到。

也就是说，即便作者自己未必意识到，他们写的是一种“为福音预备道路”的东西。你知道，我以前——我们看过的第一部电影……像《时时刻刻》（The Hours）里有一幕：Virginia Woolf 对丈夫说：“为什么必须有人死？”丈夫回答说：这样别人就会……我记不清了，大概是“更珍惜生命”之类。他说：“谁必须死？”她说：“诗人，那个有异象的人。”

有很多这样的东西。Lewis 说：“上帝给异教徒好梦。”在他们里面到处都是线索。

比如 Clint Eastwood 的电影《不可饶恕》（Unforgiven）。有人看过吗？非常暴力的电影，基本就是一个人去把所有人都枪杀。挺有意思。

最后，那个年轻的搭档看见了所有流血事件——你们还记得吗？他不停灌酒，只想稳住神经。他说：“我们杀掉的这些人——他们是罪有应得的，对吧？”Clint Eastwood 说：“我们都该被杀。我们都该死。我们都该中枪。”

从基督教角度看，这在某种意义上当然是真的。但我不知道作者心里想的是什么。

我知道你们演员必须“熬资历”。你们得去演、得积累经验、得认识人、得磨练技能。很多时候你们会做一些事，你会问：“这有什么可救赎的社会价值？”但另一方面，许多传道人在起步阶段也要做很多类似的事：我在密西西比州某个小地方（Hot Coffee 之类的地方）每个主日对着 15 位老太太讲道，我到底在为耶稣做什么？

很多人就是这样开始的。看起来并不像在改变世界。其实差不多。

还有别的问题？是的，抱歉，请讲。

我确实有个问题。你可能知道，在以前（在我出生之前），很多演员会因为演戏而被教会逐出教籍。这可追溯到圣奥古斯丁关于“虚假/撒谎”（mendacity）和表演之类的一些看法。

我想听你再多举几个“圣经里表演”的例子。你会不会说，比如耶利米用无声的方式象征性地表演某件事？

你问了两个好问题。第一个是：教会多年来确实对演员很刻薄。老实说，我现在仍然很难理解其神学理由：为什么要排斥表演与戏剧？因为我一直觉得，讲道本身就是一种表演。

他们不知道这一点。我是说，你在“演出”观念，你在“演出”例证；有时你还在“演出”故事。

我在想：他们为什么会说不行？我不是完全明白。毫无疑问，他们会说：“你在做不道德的事；你在描绘角色在做不道德的事。”可你只是描绘。

那么你就不被允许——可是如果他们说：“你绝不可写任何描绘人做不道德事的虚构作品。”那就……对我来说，写故事与演故事之间差别非常非常小。无论你是在写还是在演，你都在讲一个故事。我实在想不出：他们在神学上如何区分“写《地狱来鸿》”与“在舞台上演一个恶人”。我不明白，我仍然没弄懂。

第二个问题：圣经里有没有表演？朋友们，我的朋友 Tremper Longman（写过《传道书》最好的注释书）说，《传道书》几乎可以确定是一出戏。

这怎么理解？他在耶鲁的博士论文写的是“虚构的阿卡德式自传”（Accadian autobiography，阿卡德语/阿卡德文化）。我不要求你们记下来；我只是说，那是什么意思？他的意思是：在古代阿卡德人（与犹太人同期的文化）那里，有一种特定的写作形式——你可以说是一种文学体裁——开头用第一人称说话，说：我要给你讲这个故事，我要做这做那，我要扮演这个人、那个人；然后你就进入角色。

你说：现在我是这个，我在做这个；现在我是那个，我们在做那个；然后到结尾你再出来说：我们学到了什么？

如果你仔细看《传道书》——它以难以大纲而著名——因为一开头他说到“所罗门王”，用第三人称；然后他又说“我就是所罗门王”，说我见过这一切富足，对我来说毫无意义，都是虚空；又忽然说：我追求学问，拿到所有博士学位，也毫无意义；最后他出来说：那我们学到了什么？

Tremper 基本证明了：这正是过去那种文学体裁——基本就是“一人独角戏”：上来，说“我要做这个”；然后把它演出来；最后说“我们学到了什么”。他认为：这是一部写出来的戏，可以被演出来，而且实际上可以演得非常好。

另外，众先知也做过你所提到的那种“表演”。以西结最夸张。

我在努力回想具体例子：耶利米不会只上来讲一篇关于“你们脱离上帝的轭”的讲道，他会戴着一个轭上来，然后说：你们脱离了上帝的轭；或者他会拿一卷书卷，把它切碎、丢进火里，一边讲一边做。所以他们也在“演”。

如果你说你不该当演员、不该做那些事，那问题是：写虚构作品与表演之间的界线，讲道与任何讲故事之间的界线，再往前一步“带个道具”——比如带个轭——再往前一步……你到底在做什么？

我不知道你如何画线：这就是表演、那就不是；这就是舞台、那就不是。这不可能。而且当你试图画出圣经没有画的界线时，那就是律法主义。

你们是否因此受到很多这样的压力？算了。继续。是的，请。

我想问的是，关于画线：我往往会把整部作品当作一个整体来看——就像你说的——看整个故事、整部戏是否有某种可救赎的价值，然后再判断自己是否愿意参与。

是的。因为你演的任何角色都会做一些不义、不圣洁的事，对吧？否则就不会有故事了。对。你必须有反派。对，你会有戏剧冲突。

所以，如果我要画线，就既要在“我愿意演什么”上画线，也要在“我如何看待整部作品”上画线，对吧？——就是你的良心。

这种事，你们这些在城市里的演员群体应该聚在一起谈。你们应该彼此给出：“我这样画线”“我那样画线”。你们需要彼此磨合、试验。也许你们会积累出一种我们目前还没有的群体智慧。

也许纽约的基督徒演员会发展出几套不同的理论或指南，关于你到底该在哪里画线。但最终，我们——长老会——有《信条》（confession），其中有一章叫“良心的自由”（Liberty of Conscience）。那章说：圣经没有捆绑之处，你不可捆绑别人的良心。

圣经说你不可奸淫，那你就是不可奸淫。抱歉，我不管你说上帝告诉你什么，我不管你觉得圣灵告诉你什么——你就是不可以。但正如你所说：“我可以在舞台上做这个，但我不能做那个；我可以在舞台上做这个。”我想对多数基督徒来说，常识会告诉你：有些事就是不行。

但我们也必须非常谨慎，不要说：“如果你是基督徒，你就不该做那个。”因为良心的自由意味着：圣经并没有在每个细节上告诉我界线在哪里。

因此我们要使用智慧：看守你的良心，不要违背你的良心。如果你超越了良心真正允许你的范围——因为我需要这份工作，或我想要名声，或我想要钱——你会伤害自己很深。不要做。

不要说：“嗯，别人都觉得没问题，所以应该可以。”如果你的良心承受不了，你千万别做。雅各书说：凡你做的若不是出于信心，就是罪。你就是不能做。

所以，检查自己的良心很重要。你刚才举手了，对吧？然后——哦，这是同一个问题吗？请。

那“软弱的弟兄”呢？这也是良心的一部分吗？你是在说别人怎么想？

你知道，你是群体的一部分。如果你发现：只有你一个人觉得那样做没问题，而你 25 个最好的基督徒演员朋友都觉得不行，你大概应该再想一想。

如果你只是对某一个、或少数可能被冒犯的人过度敏感呢？你是艺术家，你会敏感。如果任何人觉得你做错了事、对你很失望……你指的是这个意思吗？也就是说你做了某件事，你会觉得：那边那个人可能会因此跌倒。

什么叫“跌倒”？好问题。比如有人觉得你很蠢——那不是让人跌倒，那是真的。

你说得完全对。圣经说“不要叫人跌倒”，真正的意思是：你不应当帮助别人去做某件事。问题在于，原来的处境是：犹太人吃祭过偶像的肉，因为在他们文化里，偶像算不得什么；而许多外邦人原先是拜偶像的，后来成了基督徒，对他们来说偶像很重要。当他们看见犹太人吃祭偶像之肉而毫不在意，外邦人就想：“那我也可以。”但当他们这么做时，他们良心就觉得与上帝隔绝、很糟糕。保罗说：你这样做是在鼓励别人去做他们无法凭信心去做的事，所以别这么做。

但在这里我不太确定会对应到什么。要小心。

“跌倒”不只是冒犯人，甚至不只是让人不舒服。比如说，我可以跳舞，但某些人对看舞蹈有“问题”，那对他们可能很难——好吧。

你知道，不同文化里，对“权威主义”的判断不同；在一个文化被视为放荡的，在另一个文化也许不被视为放荡。

所以最终，你们确实必须彼此恳求：不要在圣经留下自由之处捆绑别人的良心；并且说：我恳求你，如果这让你难受，或你无法做这件事——如果连续八周每天亲一个人会让你的心陷进去——那就别做。顺从你的良心。

但也要彼此尊重良心。不要说：“你这软弱鬼怎么回事？你不专业吗？怎么，你不能抽离吗？”也不要反过来说：“看那个人，显然是在走进罪里。”

要彼此保持联系，彼此问：你真的能做那件事吗？你刚才举手了，对吧？我会让你发言。

现在，天主教在支持艺术家方面远远胜过福音派基督徒——远远、远远胜过。是的，他们这些年也许把你们当中几个人烧死在火刑柱上，但——拜托——传福音归传福音。

不过他们确实做得更好。其实 Flannery O'Connor 写过一本很棒的书，叫《Mystery and Manners》，非常精彩。它主要是写给作者的，但你们也能从中学到很多。

我这边还没让那边的朋友发言。是的，请。让我先让那边三位。是的，请。

我现在演歌剧，但我最开始想当演员。让我遇到的一件事是：教会里的人觉得，我只是为了自己追求荣耀。

我想知道，你怎么看：我们作为艺术家应当持有什么样的态度？我们怎样帮助人们理解？

如果你是在教会里唱歌，那就不一样。嗯，如果你在教会里唱歌，那就不是为自己追求荣耀。想想看：你们有人加入过诗班吗？

你觉得全国各地的诗班里就没有人是在追求自己的荣耀吗？那传道人呢？你觉得有没有传道人……？任何站在台前的人，都有追求自己荣耀的危险。

当然，这是一种巨大的危险。但你们并不比牧师或基督徒歌手更危险，你们的危险程度是一样的。

所以，在你处理完这个问题之后——顺带一提，这确实是个问题——你会问：我为什么真正在做这件事？我若磨练某些技能——某种程度上像表演——我磨练这些技能。

讲道在某些方面是一种结合：某些方面我必须是个好作者；某些方面我必须是个好演员。如果我磨练这些技能，人们来听我——你们来听我——我到底为什么做？我跟你们的问题一样，并没有不同。这是个大问题。

但仅仅因为你想做艺术家、歌剧演员或演员，并不意味着你比别人有更大的问题——就这么简单。

我不会对一个基督徒说：“哦，你不可以。”再说一次：良心非常重要。我们到底在这里把界线画到哪里？

有些东西是显而易见的。大家都知道，比如露骨的全裸之类。有些事我们可以说：好，我们从大家都同意你不会去做的地方开始。但接下来会发生什么？我们开始讨论：那这个呢？那个呢？这个节目呢？那个节目呢？

不知不觉我们就分裂了：有人说“我对那没问题”，有人说“我不行”。我们需要这些对话；也请彼此尊重彼此的决定。经过一代人，你们可以在基督徒群体里变得更有智慧，达成更多共识，把它理清。

只是不要因为某个人就惊慌失措。总有人在你左边，总有人在你右边：总有人觉得你是自由派、是妥协者；总有人觉得你是道德主义者、是律法主义者。

我一般觉得：就像我说的，跟牧师一样，你不得不接一些角色——至少在我看来——你不得不做一些很可能毫无用处的东西，对社会没有什么帮助。

我只是希望有些东西是真正……因为外面确实有很多作品就是在刻意拉扯、摧毁传统价值观——他们就是冲着这个来的。我不想成为其中一部分。

但我们怎么知道哪些是那样、哪些不是？就彼此讨论。尝试画线。你不会一夜之间搞明白。不会一夜之间。

你越年轻，就越可能去做一些事——你会觉得良心有点不舒服，但你认为也许还能做——可要看守、要彼此谈，不要太多地违背良心。

你知道，有时候我也得等到我试了才发现：哦，我越界了。那就退出来。

继续。是的，请。

我是否应该努力？我是否应该更用力去推？你知道，一方面是说“上帝掌管这一切”、信靠他；另一方面又要尽自己的责任，包括这行的“商业层面”。

这不只是对表演的问题，但我就以表演为例。

你知道，表演的问题在于：你几乎不会在其他任何职业中得到这么多负面评价。你不会只是被拒绝一次而已；这太疯狂了。

你知道，在高薪行业里，一年一次你坐下来做绩效评估，他们说“你做得不太好”，或者甚至说“如果你不改我们就要开除你”，然后六个月后真的开了你。这都比当演员好得多；演员是一次次被拒绝、被忽视。这很难。

所以我确实认为：正因为如此——你们都知道——你们这个群体里有很多人在情绪上很脆弱。是的，很脆弱。这不奇怪。我不确定是你本来就脆弱所以想当演员，还是你当了演员之后就变得……但你们确实需要支持。

不过，不管做什么职业，你都必须问：是不是我该更努力，这就是我无法更进一步的原因？还是说我该放下，去尝试别的？

另一方面，当我在神学院时，有些神学院训练牧师，他们根本不在乎你有没有恩赐、有没有呼召、将来会不会有用；他们只要你的学费。所以他们把你送到最后。到一半或末尾，人们还在说：“我想当牧师。”而几乎所有人都能看出：这个人永远当不了牧师——他没有那个条件。但没人告诉他。

所以我其实花了不少时间（有些人以前听我讲过）提出一个“三脚架”：能力（Ability）、倾向/热爱（Affinity）、机会（Opportunity）。能力是：你做得好，别人也认为你做得好。倾向是：我真的有热情，我爱它。机会是：上帝开门。

你也许会问：我怎么知道我是不是……你不可能把自己的人生搞砸。你不能。

前几天，有人打电话给我说：我听某人的讲道，他似乎暗示我之所以还没结婚，是因为我祷告不够。我很想结婚，可我祷告不够。所以我没结婚是不是因为我祷告不够，因此我在犯罪？我说：你知道，雅各犯罪了。

他装扮成以扫，毁了整个家庭，制造了很多……把一切都搞得一团糟。可上帝却使用这罪，使他得着上帝要他得着的家庭。他若不是这样做，就不会找到那个家庭，也不会有那些孩子；这一切都借着那罪发生。

所以我说：你那套理论——“我生命没有按上帝的心意发展，是因为我在犯罪”——怎么办？

我个人认为，上帝如此主权：如果你犯罪、做错事，你的生命会有一段时间被破坏，那是你的错；然而如果你犯罪，但你是他的孩子，他爱你，那么所有那些应许仍会临到你，他会甚至借着那罪把祝福带进你的生命。

当然，你会一生都懊悔“我不该那样做”，你确实不该。但你无法把你的人生搞砸。所以不要为了成功而把自己逼死——若他不……就别。

不过，如果经过一段时间（我也不知道该让人等多久），倾向、能力与机会始终无法同时出现：有些人想做，大家也都说他能做，可机会就是不来。你总不是在对的时间、对的地点、以对的“颧骨结构”出现。

你知道这行怎么回事。常常这几乎跟才华无关，只是“我在找一个你这种身材、这种颧骨、这种眨眼方式的人”。然后忽然之间，一个人的事业就成了。

如果这不能把你变成加尔文主义者，我不知道还有什么能。真的。

所以，如果机会没有来；或者除非它们在你不断敲门之后终于一起出现——别害怕你失败了，别害怕你把上帝原本要你当演员的人生给弄坏了，以至于现在当不了，因为你不够努力；放松一点。

从某些方面说，你和其他人一样；但我认为，如果那些门迟迟不开，长期坚持表演确实更难。

其他人可以在自己的工作上坚持更久，才说“我要试试别的”。所以你们需要彼此扶持。

但最终，我认为表演——实际上，我认识的许多后来去做别的事的演员——都发现它丰富了他们做很多其他事的能力。不要想：“我把这么多时间都投在这里了。”几乎你之后做的任何事都会受益。

表达呈现（presentation）非常重要；你把事情呈现给人的能力、你知道如何向人呈现的能力，会在很长时间里成为你的助力。
