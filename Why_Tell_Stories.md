Today on the podcast, Tim Keller helps us  understand how the Gospel frees us to have hope and joy in our vocations. This is a sermon with a nice climax moving on. This is a string of random thoughts. It's  possible you get more out of the questions and answers afterwards than whatever I tell you about  now, but I think you need to know if you're Christian, what is the rationale for being an actor? You know, why should Christians be actors?

Why should Christians be actors? What do actors do of  any worth from a Christian point of view? That's what I want to talk about. So that's why I mean,  I have a series of random thoughts on that. But let me start by getting you something out of the  New York Times.

I was intrigued by the fact that Bill T. Jones, the dancer and choreographer,  etc, has a new piece that he's putting on based on Flannery O'Connor's, one of Flannery O'Connor's  short stories. Now what's interesting is here's Bill T. Jones. He says, this is his interview.

He says,  I'm angry as hell at the Bush administration. I'm not pleased with the fundamentalist  lineage in this country. And he's sort of ranting and raging as a sort of normal typical New York  secular liberal person. However, he was utterly entranced with Flannery O'Connor's short stories. And he comes right out and says, he's just overwhelmed.

He says, the best short stories. And he wanted to  put them on stage, at least one of them. And what's intriguing is, first of all, number one, the stories,  the one he used is incredibly overtly Christian. It's a story about a grandfather and a grandson  who are living alone in the hinterland of Georgia in the probably in the 30s or 40s. And the boy is just getting uppity.

So the grandfather says, I'm going to take him into  Atlanta because he wants to go to the big city. And he's really almost never seen running water. He's never seen almost anything. And he's not going to take him to the big city until you get your  fill of it. And then you'll see, you know, it's nothing special.

And he takes him in and unfortunately  the boy likes what he sees and he's getting more and more what he would consider uppity. And at one  point, the grandfather, when the boy's taking a nap, abandons him, just runs away from him, gets around  a corner just to show him, just to teach him a lesson. It's very mean-spirited. Also all during  the, obviously all during the story, the grandfather is showing, you know, tremendously realistic  but really venal racist attitudes, you know, everywhere. So he's, you don't like him at all.

And when he abandons his grandson and he scares the grandson, there's a terrible incident which  the boy just runs through the crowd just screaming, where is the grandfather,  knocks a woman over the police come, the police want to know who's boy is this and the grandfather  is so scared because he never deals with the police actually denies the boy, denies that he's the  boy's grandfather and walks away. And there's this horrible rift. And in the end, in a very enigmatic  and fascinating way, the boy forgives the grandfather. Now, Bill T. Jones, he comes right out and says,  this is fascinating to me.

And I'll reach at the end of it. He says, Flannery O'Connor is a non-ironic  Catholic believer. Now, and she is a very strong Christian Catholic believer. And here's what Bill  T. Jones said.

He says, she believes that there's this thing called grace and that grace sometimes hits  us right between the eyes when we are mostly based. Now she and I may disagree on this. He disagrees  with the basic idea. And while O'Connor seems to make all these connections that I may not agree on,  all I know is it's a tremendously powerful, overwhelmingly strong story and I wanted to put it  on stage. In fact, here's how it ends.

He just talked about how overtly Christian it is. The  grandfather's name is Mr. Head, by the way. It's that Mr. Head stood very still and felt the action  of mercy touch him because at the very end the boy forgives him and says, let's go home.

He says,  he felt the action of mercy touch him but this time he knew that there were no words in the world  that could name it. He understood that mercy grew out of agony, which is not denied to any man  and which is given in strange ways to children. He understood that it was all a man could carry into  death to give his maker and he suddenly burned with shame that he had so little of it to take with him. He stood appalled judging himself with the thoroughness of God while the action of mercy covered  his pride like a flame and consumed it. He had never thought himself a great sinner before but  he now saw that his true depravity had been hidden from him lest it caused him to spare.

He realized  that he was forgiven for sins from the beginning of time when he had conceived in his own heart the  sin of Adam until the present when he had denied poor Nelson, that's his grandson. He saw that  Nelson was too monstrous for him to claim his own and since God loved in proportion as he  forgave, he felt ready at that instant to enter paradise. Bilti Jones is putting this on. Now why  it's a tremendously well told story. It's not an essay which he could have easily written  on why there is a God and we are sinful and God does forgive us in proportion to our  our sin and only if we understand where sinners can we turn and get the mercy and therefore the  worst we know ourselves to be the more mercy we get.

In other words, he could have written that essay  and Bilti Jones wouldn't even have read it. It wouldn't even have turned it over but it's a story. If somebody at one point asked Flierry O'Connor, he said, I'm trying to understand this story  I read of years and it's wonderful. Could you give me a nutshell what it means? Just in a nutshell,  a sentence or two what it means.

You know what she said? Very famous. She said, if I could give it to  you in a nutshell, I wouldn't have had to write the story. If I could have told it to you in two  sentences, I wouldn't have had to write the story. Now, what are actors?

There's a difference between  writers and actors. His actors are like Jesus making the word flesh. They're taking a story  which is invisible and making it visible. You know, Jesus was the word made flesh. There was a word  but it was invisible and he embodied it.

Now what actors do is they tell stories but they don't  just tell stories. They embody stories. Of course, you really can't tell a story without acting  to some degree but you are embodying a story and people need stories and stories are just about  the best possible way to change people's worldview, change people's understanding of things and  that's what you do. Now let me back up and give you a couple random when I say random. They're not  totally random because they're kind of, they're sort of logical but some ideas about what stories are  and why they have the impact they have.

First of all, what's the story? You might find this odd. The best place I've ever read a definition of a story is in the Harvard Business Review. A two or three Hollywood screenwriters wrote an article because the Harvard Business Review was  saying it CEOs when they're trying to persuade people stupidly, use graphs and figures  and they just give you facts and figures. He says that's not what changes people's minds.

That's not  what motivates people. You need to tell a story. And they have no idea what about stories in  MBA school. So they said here's what a story is. Three things.

First of all, well, it's actually two  things in a way. Something knocks life off balance. You do not have a story unless something has knocked  life out of whack. So you know, the classic is Lillard Riding Hood took her grandmother goodies is a  principal. It's a fact.

You know, it's a graph. It's not a story. But Lillard Riding Hood  went to take her grandmother goodies, but the big bad wolf had eaten her grandmother and was waiting  for her in bed. That's a story. Something is, you know, knocked life out of whack.

Then because  something is knocked life out of whack, you have, and there's been a lot of ink spilled about this  for years now, you have protagonist and antagonist. A protagonist means a pro-agonizer. You're  agonizing for something. And the antagonist is the anti-agonizer. And the protagonist is trying  to get life back in balance.

And the antagonists are the people who are against you or the forces  that are against you that are trying to stop you from do that. You don't have a story unless you  have protagonist and antagonist. And when I said there's been a lot of ink spilled over the years  about this, I'm going to tell you in a minute that almost everybody from liberal to conservative  realizes that the reason stories are so powerful is that there's no way for a human being to  attach meaning to anything unless you put it into a storyline. And there's no such thing as a  storyline without something being knocked off balance, and some people struggling to put it back  in balance, and some people against them, right? You don't have a story unless you've got good  guys and bad guys, or at least of some sort.

And the reason people are pretty upset about that is  if you can't attach meaning to something without a story, and if story is got always  protagonists and antagonists, there's no way to attach meaning to anything without  basically dividing the world into good guys and bad guys. And every master story that helps  you organize reality has to have, quote, the other capital O. Somebody that we see is the bad guy. And that is one of the problems we have in the world right now. And you can ask me more about  if you want.

So a story is something knocks life off a balance. Protagonists try to get it back  in balance against the eye tag, and I guess the third thing you would say is the resolution of  the story is is the mission success or not. Stories don't have to have happy endings. You know, they can have ambiguous endings, they can have like no endings, which of course is  really cool and avant garde, you know, not to end it. But the point of the matter is even if that  you don't end the story, if you don't end it happily, you know the story should end, or you know  the story hasn't ended.

Because you know that stories have endings. And so maybe the story, maybe  the play, maybe the movie doesn't really tell you how it ends, but you know there should be an end. That's what a story is. Now, I already said this. That's the first thing.

That's what a story is. Secondly, I already alluded to this. You cannot attach meaning to anything unless you  put it in a storyline. Now my best examples of this, my favorite example, this is 9-11. There's a liberal storyline.

And the liberal storyline is America are the bad people in the world,  and the oppressed in the poor are the good. And there's a conservative storyline, which is America  are the good people. We believe in democracy and we're good people. And out there is all sorts of  totalitarianism and all sorts of, you know, low IQ and all sorts of other people. And so we're  the good guys and they're the bad guys as opposed to liberal.

And so what happened when 9-11 comes  along? What do they do? Some people said, you see, they hate us because we are so big and so bad. Conservative said, see, they hate us because we're so good. And now we have to do something about it.

In other words, what they immediately did was they said, what this means is we got to do a war  on terror. The liberal said what this means is we've got to, you know, admit what we're doing in  the world and how people hate us and so on. They took the incident and they couldn't make sense of  it unless they brought it into a storyline. Now the best storyline was actually Giuliani and  Pataki. And what they said was this tragedy can make us a stronger city.

If we pull together,  we can do it. We can do it. So what they did was they, you know, they put it in a different  storyline. But nobody could talk about it without putting it into a storyline. Nobody could just give  you facts.

You can't make sense of anything. You can't attach meaning to anything unless you put  it into a narrative. You watch newspapers, look at plays, everybody's got the assumption behind  every story is life ought to be in a certain way. Something has knocked it off balance. And these are  the people trying to put it into balance and these are the people who are against it.

Now first  of all, that means you can't attach meaning to your own life unless you have a master storyline. There's some people who say my master storyline is I am bringing myself out of very, very humble  roots and abusive background. And I'm going to make something of myself. That's their storyline. Other people, it's a quest for true love.

There's no doubt about it. That's their storyline. Other people, I'm a free spirit artist and I'm trying to make the world safe for free spirit artists  like me. And, you know, it's the oppressive, traditional people that really is why the world is  bad. Everybody's got a narrative by which they are saying, this is what my life means.

And, and this would be in the book, if any of you read that book that I'd recommend it to Luan. What that book says is everybody has a worldview, which is you can't operate without a kind of macro  story view of what the world story is. In other words, when you look out in the world,  obviously the world's not what it ought to be. Something is knocked the world off whack. Poverty isn't a good thing.

War isn't a good thing. Races isn't a good thing. You know,  psychological problems are a good thing. What is wrong with the world? And we'll put it right.

So, Marx had an idea. He kind of vilified, you know, the in a bourgeois and he vilified the,  you know, the owners of the means of production. And he said, basically, state control of economy  will make the difference. Freud had an approach. Everybody's got an approach.

Buddhist say,  the real problem is individual consciousness. You think you're an individual self and you don't  see your part of the old soul. See, Plato and the Greeks, they said the real problem is the material  world and the way it drags you down. Everybody says, this here is the villain. This is the antagonist.

This is what's wrong. And here's what you have to do to put it right. Everybody's got that. And they're called worldviews. No matter who you are, you can't live without one.

But a worldview is actually just a master narrative of what you think is wrong with the world,  who's on the right side to get it back, who's on the wrong side, who's against getting it back,  and what do we have to do? Now, what this means for Christians is this. The biggest problem,  of course, that actors have, unlike writers or maybe other kinds of artists, is generally speaking,  unless you, I guess some of you have done this, you're acting out. You're embodying stories  that somebody else has written. And you might say, was Christians, you say, I never act in a story  that I feel like is a great Christian story with a Christian message to it.

Well, I want you to  consider something for a second. What is the Christian master story? What do we think the world  story is? What do we think the main problem is? What do we think the master story is?

Here's  let me give it to you in a nutshell. Everything was created good, but everything has fallen  through sin. Everything is broken through sin. And through Christ, everything's going to be redeemed. Now, let me tell you what that means.

A Greek worldview says the body's bad. The spirit is good. The Buddhist worldview says the spirit is good, but material reality is an illusion. You know, Marx would actually say, you know, the capitalists are bad and the proletariat's good. The awful lot of conservatives would say it's the other way around.

You know, the proletariat,  the great unwashed, we have to watch out, you know, about, we have to be careful about them. You know, they don't know what's, you know, there's Hobbes as opposed to Locke. Everybody had,  everybody said, this is what's wrong with the world. The Christian story refuses to vilify any one  created thing. We would never say the body's bad and the spirit's good because we believe the body  and the spirit are both sinful.

They've both been tainted with sin. The problem in the world is sin,  not this group of people versus this group of people, not culture versus nature or nature versus  culture or anything like that. The Christian worldview never vilifies any one thing, nor does it  idolize anything. You know, so in Marxism, there's certain people that can do no wrong and certain  people can do no right. But every single worldview tends to paint things in black and white because the  protagonist are always these people and the antagonist are always these people.

If you believe the  Christian storyline, your sinners, you are not the good guys. And they're out there, the people  aren't Christians, they're in the image of God. They're not actually the bad guys. Christians  have a story that is the most nuanced of all stories. We should be the slowest to, you know, to put  white hats on some people and dark hats on other people.

And we should be the, it should be the  easiest for us to look into almost anybody else's story, no matter out of any other worldview and say,  yeah, I mean, see, for example, because we believe that every part of the human body is fallen,  every part of the human personality is fallen. If you get a story that talks about the dangers of  sexual activity, okay, but if you get a story that actually lifts up the beauty of sexuality,  that's okay too. See, we're not like Buddhists or the Greeks who just see sexuality is actually  basically a seductive thing because we like the material world. We think it's a good thing. We  think God created the material world and Jesus has a material body.

So Christians ought to be able  to find elements of their story and almost any other story. I mean, obviously there are stories  that you don't want to act in that actually are deliberately trying to lift up the very worst  things and celebrate them. But generally speaking, I would think Christian actors would be able to  find a good reason to act in an awful lot of other stories, an awful lot of other stories because  other stories, people's stories tend to tell part of the Christian story because the Christian  story so comprehensive. Everything is good. Everything was created good and therefore there's  really nothing to be looked at.

But everything is fallen, so there's nothing that you should be  lifting up. So almost any story that shows you the problem of anything is possible. Almost any  story that shows you the goodness of anything is possible. It's all part of the Christian story. One last thing and then we'll take some questions.

At this point, you've got to pretty much act in  other people's stories. But if you ever get a chance to put your own together and act them out,  what I find fascinating about evangelism, I've come to realize that when I was younger, people  said, well, here's how you share your faith and they would give me outlines. There's various  outlines. Let me give you a quick example of the problem with that. My parents' generation,  and they're in their 80s now, the whole generation of my parents had in a sense, there was in  America when they grew up and their depression in World War II, their cultural narrative,  their main cultural story, was what really matters in life is not what you believe, but that you're  a good person, a really good person, that you're decent, you're honest, you're good to your  family, you're hardworking, that was the cultural narrative.

My children who are now in their 20s,  early 20s, my kids, I see they're part of a different generation and their cultural narrative is  not the important thing is to be good. For them, the important thing is to be free and to be free  to be really yourself and not to be enslaved or not to be oppressed or not to be controlled by  anything else. If you say that my kids' generation, the important thing is to be good, they would say  to find good. If you said that to my parents' generation, nobody would say that. Now, what's the gospel?

Well, you can say Jesus died for your sins, yes, of course, but what is  sin? You have to connect, grace sin, you have to connect the Christian story with the baseline  cultural narratives of your own, of the story of the generation. So, for example, what I would say to  I still do to older people, I would say, you think you're good, but you're really not good enough. You actually fall down in all these ways, only through Jesus can you be forgiven. But what I'd say  to my kids' generation is you think you're free, but you're really not.

Because if you make anything  other than Jesus Christ, the center of your life, you're a slave to that. And therefore, only through  Christ will you be freed. Now, by the way, in the Bible, what's interesting, there's a place where  Paul says, he says, the Jews wanted power, and the Greeks wanted wisdom. But I preached them  Christ, the power of God, and the wisdom of God, though foolish and weak. Now, here's what he was  saying.

What he's trying to say is, Greeks were intellectuals, and what they really thought was  important was philosophy and understanding and rationality. The Jews were practicals. And what they  wanted to know is how does it work? They wanted power. They wanted results.

He did not preach Christ  to them the same. What he did was on the one hand, he challenged the Jews' story, basic cultural  story, and said, Jesus Christ seems nuts to you because he came in weakness, a weak Messiah on  the cross. And yet, it's really the strength he've always been looking for. And he says something  differently to the Greeks. He says, Jesus Christ is foolish.

In other words, he wasn't educated,  he didn't go to the right schools, he didn't write any books. And yet, he's got the real wisdom  that you're looking for. In other words, what Paul is trying to say is that only in Jesus Christ  does the baseline cultural story of any group or generation or society have a happy ending. What your society wants, is it wisdom, is it power, is it freedom, is it goodness,  whatever they want, it'll only have a happy ending in Jesus. Otherwise, it'll self-destruct.

Because what it'll do is it'll turn, it'll turn something that's inadequate into the  protagonist's hero. And it'll turn something which is good and created, though fallen, into the  villain, into the antagonist, into the idol. So I would have to say that if you understand the  Christian's story, and you are basically storytellers, which is what actors are. In the long run,  Christianity is so comprehensive that you should be able to appreciate and take part in other  people's stories knowing that you're actually bringing about truth into the people's lives,  you're watching it. And ultimately, I think it's important to really, really get engaged and  really enter in deeply into our own culture stories so that we can understand them and eventually  bring Christ to bear.

If you don't get into the culture, if you don't get into the stories of  the culture, when you do talk about Jesus, it just goes like this, because you're actually  answering questions that they're not asking. Because ultimately, ultimately, the gospel is God  saved you through a story, not through a bunch of principles. God did not show up with a bunch of  principles and said, if you do these things, you'll go to heaven. What happened was God comes in  the world through Jesus Christ and saves you by what he did. He saves you through a story, a true  story, of course, not through you're just being obedient and going to church and obeying.

So salvation is through a story. And the story is so comprehensive. It takes in all other stories  and resolves them. So I know it's a little bit mind-blowing and over. It's not exaggerated.

I absolutely  believe it, but on the other hand, I realize it's a lot to take in. So, would you please, where I  have been obscure, where you want me to elaborate, where I was actually totally obscure? Just raise  a hand and let's start talking about what I just went through. So yeah, right here. What about the issue of holiness for actors?

Because even in some of the best of stories,  they're asked to do things like his or woman who's not their spouse. Maybe where something  we're feeling or you take clothes off or even have to act out of lust or out of cruelty,  have these feelings. And that seems to go against being holy because we don't really have any kind  of standard for this in the Bible. You know, the apostles were never actors or they were never,  it seems like they would never put themselves in those kinds of positions where they would make  themselves that vulnerable to sin. Wait, in other words, do you feel like if you're actually acting  out the sin, but you're not doing the sin?

So what do you mean? In other words, if you're acting out  something that would be wrong if you were doing it in reality, but you're not actually doing it  on the stage, or are you doing it? Let's say you're married and you have to kiss the same  person every day, eight times a week. That can probably maybe create some feelings of lust for  that specific person. Then don't do it.

That's all. I mean, and you have to know your own,  you have to know yourself here. You know, the book, Screwtape Letters by C.S. Lewis, okay. Which by the way, John Cleese, you know who John Cleese is?

John Cleese, though I understand it's  hard to get them anymore. John Cleese has read a selection of them and it's hilarious. He's wonderful. But however, it's a letters of a senior devil to a junior devil on how to attempt human beings. And in the beginning, in the intro, there's an interesting place where Lewis has said that it was  hard.

In other words, he says, in order to write the book, he had to imagine himself being evil,  which isn't terribly hard. And he actually, he quotes a place in Deuteronomy where he says,  my own heart showed me the way of the ungodly. Because he says, because he was a professor of  medieval literature, a couple of reviewers had said, well, the reason this is so realistic about,  you know, how Screwtape's knowledge of sin and temptation and seduction is clearly based on  Professor Lewis's mastery of the medieval literature on moral philosophy and the Catholic church. And Lewis says, just not truly. He says, my own heart showed me the way of the ungodly.

He says,  I, I basically was able to access my own heart, all the evil nasty things and bad things  and that Screwtape did. But he says, there was a place at which I had to stop. Because I said,  by imagining it, I was, he says, at some point I really felt like I was going to suffocate. So I  stopped. Now you see, he couldn't even write that.

Would you have said, oh, he shouldn't write that. He couldn't write that without he had to be careful. Because it was, you know, it's sort of the  opposite of a quiet time where you're trying to get in touch with your best side and you're trying  to fan the flame of, you know, what God has done there by the Holy Spirit. The trouble with if  you're acting the part of an evil person or a wicked person or even writing in his case, it was  a fiction piece. So it's basically the same thing.

He found that there was a limit at one point  where he said, I just have to stop this because it's, you know, I'm accessing parts of myself that  shouldn't be there anyway. So I would say that you have to be very careful, but doesn't mean that  you should never be able to depict badness or sin in this. The Bible depicts it. It's horrible  things in the Bible. And I think most people would say, well, I could act a biblical story, right?

I mean, wouldn't, wouldn't you want to act out a biblical story? But somebody's got to act the  evil people in the biblical story. So at least, and you say, well, it's in, it's in, you know,  it's in the service of telling people the truth. But see, somebody's going to have to do it. See,  watch your own heart.

I just know there's certain people that are able to detach and certainly  hurt not. Now, I know something about the method acting thing unless that's dead now or is it not? No, it's not dead. To me, there's a big difference between saying, I know enough  that I can act this out. And I think that's very different than people say, I want you to hate,  I just want you to fill your heart with hate.

You know, you're supposed to be acting out hate. So I want you to feel hate. I want you to hate the person on the stage. I don't think that's acting  anymore. I'm sorry.

Acting is, you are trying to look like something that you're not. I mean,  there's John Wayne, as I was talking about. There's people who made lots of money with that acting  at all. And there's a few other people I'll name that I won't name. But who clearly don't do any  acting, they just, they obviously just get up there and they feel their feelings and they do what  they do.

And for whatever reason, people have paid money to see it. But I think acting really means  I'm, I'm supposed to act hateful, but not be hateful. And I do, I certainly know there's acting  coaches that want you to be hateful. I don't know what you say. You just smile.

You know, I don't  see how you can, first of all, I'm not sure how you can do that, frankly. I even wonder whether  that's even possible. So watch out. I'm sorry, I should, let's get some other questions, but that was  a great question. It's estimated that most of us spend half of our waking hours at work.

How does  the wisdom of the Bible apply to our careers? In other words, how can our work connect with God's  work? And how can our vocations be more emotional? In his book, Every Good and Devere, Tim Keller draws  from decades of teaching on vocation and calling to show you how to find true joy in your work. As you serve God and others, the book offers surprising insights into how a Christian perspective  on work can serve as the foundation for a thriving career and a balanced personal life.

Every Good  and Devere is our thank you for your gift to help gospel and life share Christ's love with more  people around the world. Just visit gospel and life dot com slash give that's gospel and life dot com slash  give. Let's keep going, Max. Right. Do you have a vision for your demer's role in the second part of that?

I'm off for it. It's not specifically. No, of course. Who knows? I didn't realize when did the Salvation Army  two years ago?

Yeah, you know, you know, Ray Crox, it was in the paper. Did you see that? The founder of McDonald's, his widow recently gave the Salvation Army $1.5 billion. Yeah, four. Well, yeah, but they're trying to create community centers, 25 communities and  that's a lot of money.

Who knows? I'm not sure what they expect to be doing with all that,  but if they're building, if they're able to build small theaters and all that,  yeah, that's, that is beautiful. When you see Flannery O'Connor,  and what I did was I had been here since I read the art, read the short story when I said,  gosh, what would take Bill T. Jones? Clearly, he even says he's hostile to Christianity.

He doesn't like it at all, but he was overwhelmed by what a great story it was. I said, wouldn't it be great? I mean, we don't have many contemporary Christians who create stories  that good, that actually draws people in because they sense the truth of it, even though intellectually,  I mean, intellectually, they don't believe Christian doctrine, but the trouble, a story flies beneath  the radar and hits them in the imagination. Where the Bible says there is a knowledge of God,  Romans 1, where it says they hold down the truth and unrighteousness. There is a knowledge of God,  and stories get to people at that, at that level, frankly.

So I, you know, I would say it's  going to take time for us to, you know, you don't have enough Christians even trying,  and it takes, you know, it takes, it seems to take thousands of people trying to get a few people  through, you know, and hit it. So we need a lot more people trying. But sure, I mean, I'm all  for it. I'm serious, but I can't say beyond that exactly. I know what's going to happen.

I'm open to suggestions. I'm sure you're all ready to give me some. Some other, yes. Go ahead. Could you comment a little bit about working the Christian storyline  deep down into the fabric of something, the way you do it, the law of the race?

Yeah. In other words, the Christian storyline, I didn't mention it because I always thought that,  I thought that actors, I know actors would like to be writers, right? They'd like to put  your own stuff together. Well, also, is there anything, I'm not a part of the question, is there,  is there any other forms of theater or film or anything that you would cite as a very good example  of that, but that it's not, you know, purely a sort of a Christian play on the surface? Oh, yeah.

You know, I should, I need to access my memory tapes. Yes. The question would be,  first question is, and I agree with this, even since I said it, it's nice that I still agree with  what I said a year ago, is that one of the problems that I think a lot of Christians make when they  tell the Christian story is they don't bury the narrative deep in, yeah, in the cultural form. So what was, to me, brilliant about Tolkien, here's a guy, he's a professor of Anglo-Saxon, he's  probably one of the three or four people in the world at his, you know, in his heyday, who knew  the most about Old English, the language and Gothic and Icelandic and Finnish and, you know,  Northern European pagan pre-historical roots. And what he did was he saw, he said,  did you know, for example, Northern European mythology?

You know what Gurdardemmerung is? You know, you say, well, yeah, that's something with Wagner. Do you know, in Northern European  mythology, the Danemois, the final, in the final sort of Armageddon, is that the gods and the heroes  of all the centuries are resurrected to battle against the monsters and the ogres and the demons and  all the villains. There's this huge battle on this particular plane to see who's actually going to  win the world for the rest of eternity. And the gods and the heroes die.

That's what's called  Gurdardemmerung is the twilight of the gods. They all, the good guys lose. And that's how history is  going to go. And the Anglo-Saxon, the Northern European mythology was, that's okay because  nobility is to be good even though you know you're going down to a never ending defeat. That was  nobility.

A high doom was before the hero that I'm going to do what is right. And actually, what's  interesting is if you've ever read the dream of the rude, which is an old English poem, but it's  a Christian poem because Christianity came. They were fascinated by the idea of Jesus Christ going to  the cross. That's nobility. Knowing that the right thing to do was to go down to this terrible defeat.

And that got into the Anglo-Saxon world and sort of, you know, it came in it. It wasn't a complete  head on collision between what Christianity said, the pessimism of the Northern European world  met the optimism of Christianity and it changed the pessimism. But the idea of nobility and heroism  and valor and doing what's right even though you're dying as you do it was not really changed. It  was redeemed. Now, Tolkien tried to imagine the Anglo-Saxon mythology, which is all lost because  those dirty French-speaking Normans came over across the channel in the Battle of Hastings and wiped  out the Anglo-Saxon culture.

We have almost, we have something like 45 pages of Anglo-Saxon  ancient literature and everything, all the rest of it's gone. So what Tolkien said is, I want to imagine  what all that mythology would be like. I'm going to imagine and then I'm going to have to be  pre-Christian. But I'm a Christian. And therefore, what I'm going to do is I'm going to  imagine pre-Christian mythology sort of cleansed of a lot of its pessimism.

Yes, even though if  you read Lord of the Rings, it's sad. It's a very sad. He wanted to keep that and wanted to keep  the idea that you can't win without losing as least as much as you won. And he kept that because  he loved the sadness and he felt that that was part of... He thought that was Christian.

He was  pre-Christian. It was common grace. It was general revelation. It was revelation that came to them  even though they weren't Christians yet. It was truth.

So what he tried to do was he tried to  enter into these ancient myths and preserve the truth and actually enhance it a little bit  from a Christian perspective. And when it was all done, he's a great example of this because  there's no overt reference of any sort in the Lord of the Rings to Christianity or religion or even  God. But when you're all done, you feel cleansed with it. When you read a thing, you say, I've read a  holy thing. I feel cleansed by it.

How did that happen? He buried the narrative, the storyline. So you have Gandalf's resurrected Lord and Frodo's the suffering servant and Aragren's returning  king and you've got it everywhere. But he doesn't have a Christ figure. He's got so many of them.

So if he had a Christ figure, if he had an azzle on or something like that, then it looks like a Christian  fable or a parable. Now what was your second part of your question, though? Is there any? Is there any  other works that you would know? No, but you know, there are a lot of movies when you're done with them  or plays when you're done with them.

You say, it's very obvious the person who wrote that was not a  Christian, but what they wanted to say was very important for people to hear if they're ever going  to be prepared for Christianity. And I see them all over the place. Yeah, I mean, whether or not they  actually realize that they're writing something that is for family. Yeah. You know, I used to  the first movie we had.

It was just like a scene in the hours when Virginia Woolf says to a  Virginia Woolf's husband says to her, why does somebody have to die? And the answer is so that others  will, I can't remember exactly, appreciate life more or something like that. And he says,  who has to die and she says the poet, the visionary? Yeah, there's lots of, you know,  what Lewis said that God gave the pagans good dreams. You know, and there's all sorts of clues  all through them.

You know, the Clint East would move the unforgiven. Anybody know that movie? Very violent movie, really. It's just about a guy who goes and shoots everybody. It's kind of  interesting.

At the very end, this kid sidekick who's seen all this bloodshed, do you remember this  at all? He's just chugging down some alcohol, just trying to study his nerves and he said,  all these people that we've killed, they had a common. They deserved it, right? And Clint East would  say, we all deserve to be killed. We all deserve to die.

We all deserve to be shot. You know,  which of course, from a Christian point of view is absolutely true in a way, but you know, I don't  know what I don't know was in the mind of the writer, but it's all, I mean, I know to some degree,  you actors have got to pay your dues. You've got to act. You've got to get your experience. You've  got to get to know people.

You've got to hone your skills. And very often, you're doing things  that you say, what redeeming social value is this? But on the other hand, a lot of preachers  spend a lot of time doing that in the early days, too. What am I doing for Jesus preaching here  in the middle of hot coffee, Mississippi, to 15 old ladies every Sunday? And a lot of people,  that's how you get started.

It doesn't seem like you're really changing the world. It's not a  whole lot different. So some other. Yes, I'm sorry. Go ahead.

Oh, yeah. I actually had a question. You probably already know this like in the past, like before my age, a lot of actors, like,  well, yeah, like they're excommunicated from their church for acting. And it goes back to the  whole St. Augustine thing about Mendacity and backding and all the aspects.

I just like to think  I just like to hear from you a few more examples of acting in the Bible. Would you say like  Jeremiah portraying something silently? Well, you're asking two good questions. The one question,  of course, is the church has been nasty to actors for many years. And I still have some trouble,  frankly, and I know something about church is I have a little trouble understanding the theological  justification for excluding acting and drama because I keep thinking one of the things is,  it's impossible to preach.

You don't, you know, you're preaching as a form of acting. I don't think  they know that. I mean, you, you're acting out ideas. You're acting out illustration. Sometimes  you're acting out stories.

I'm trying to figure out why they would say, I don't quite completely  understand. There's no doubt that they said you do the immoral things. Your portrayal character was  doing well. Well, yeah, you're portraying. So you're not allowed to, well, see the real, if they had  said you must never write fiction in which you're portraying people doing immoral things.

Which is,  to me, the difference is very, very small, whether you're, whether you're writing a story or acting  out a story, you are still telling a story. And what I can't quite figure out is what the theological  distinction would be between writing the screw tape letters and acting evil on a, you know, acting  like an evil character on the stage. I don't understand. I still haven't figured that out. Now, second  question, oh, in the Bible, my friend, Trevor Longman, who has written the best commentary ever  on Ecclesiastes, says the book of Ecclesiastes is almost certainly a play.

And here's how this works. He wrote his doctoral dissertation at Yale on fictional accadian autobiography,  accadian AKKADIA. And I'm not, don't write it down, but I just want to say what is this? And what he  meant is that in ancient times, in the accadians, which were contemporaries to the Jews and all that,  there was a particular form of, I guess you could say, it was a literary genre, in which in the  beginning you spoke in the first person. And you said, I'm going to tell you this story, I'm going  to do this and this and this, and I'm going to be this person, this person, and then you go into  character.

You say, now I'm this, and I'm doing this, now I'm this, and then we're doing this, now  at the end you come out again and say, now what did we learn? And if you actually look at the  book of Ecclesiastes, which is notoriously hard to outline, because in the very beginning he talks  about, you know, Solomon the King and the third person, and then he talks about I am Solomon the  King and I have seen all these riches and it means nothing to me. It's vanity, all this vanity. And  then suddenly he says, and now I have, you know, I have done learning and I have gotten all my PhDs,  and it means nothing to me. And at the very end he comes out and says, now what have we learned?

And Trempord pretty much proves by saying, this is exactly the kind of literary genre we had  in the past where it's basically one man play. Comes up and says, I'm going to do this,  and then acts it out, and then at the end says, what have we learned? And he says, it's a written  out play which could be acted out and it actually could be acted out extremely well. The other  thing is all the prophets did do acting as you have already wisely alluded to. Ezekiel was the  worst.

I mean, I'm trying to remember what they were, but I mean, Jeremiah would not just come in  and preach a sermon about the fact that you have thrown off God's yoke, he would come in wearing a  yoke. And he would say, you've thrown off God's yoke, or he would take a scroll and cut it up and  throw it in the fire as he was talking and so on. So they acted as well. The problem with saying  you shouldn't be an actor or you shouldn't do those things is that the line between fiction,  writing fiction and acting, the line between preaching and any kind of storytelling,  and then going one step further with a bring an object, you know, one step further bringing a  yoke or something. And the next, what are you doing?

I mean, I don't know how you can, where do you  draw the line? Say, that's acting and that's not. That's stage and that's not. It's impossible. And it's legalistic, frankly, whenever you try to draw lines, the Bible hasn't drawn.

So do you get a lot of it? Well, never mind. Let's keep going. Yes, go ahead. I just want to ask about drawing the line because I tend to look at the whole piece as a whole,  like you were saying, if there was any redeeming value in the in the whole story or the whole  play or whatever, and then, you know, whether that's something that wanted to participate.

Yeah. Because any character you do is going to be doing things that are not righteous and  holy, right? There wouldn't be a story. Right. So you got to have antagonists.

Right. You're going to be dramatic conflicts. You're going to, if I draw the line, there's a point  where you draw the line in terms of what I would portray and also how I view the whole piece, right? Your conscience. Now, this is the sort of thing that you should be trying to come together as actors  in a city and talk about.

And you ought to give one another. Here's how I draw the line. And here's  where I draw the line. And you need to try this out. And maybe, maybe you would develop a cumulative  wisdom that we don't have right now.

And that there might be a, you know, a couple of different theories  that guidelines that Christian actors in New York have developed about where you draw the line. But in  the end, we, we have got a Presbyterians have a confession. And there's a chapter in a confession  called Liberty of Conscience. And that confession says that you mustn't bind other people's conscience  is where the Bible hasn't. So the Bible says you can't commit adultery.

Then you just can't. I'm  sorry, I don't care what God told you. I don't care what you're, you know, you think the Spirit told  you. You can't. But as you say, I can, you know, I can do this on stage.

But I can't do that. I can  do this on stage. Common sense, I think for most Christians would be, you know, that you can't do  that. But we have to be very careful about saying, if you're a Christian, you shouldn't be doing that. Because, because Liberty of Conscience is, the Bible hasn't told me exactly where.

So we're going to  have to use, watch your conscience, do not violate your conscience. See, if you go further than your  conscience, really will let you go, because I need the job, or I want the prestige, or I want the  money, you hurt yourself pretty badly. Don't do it. Don't say, well, you know, everybody else thinks  this is all right. And I guess it's okay.

If your conscience can't bear it, don't you dare do it. It says in James, whatever you do, it's not a faith for you, it's sin. You just cannot do it. So it is important to check your conscience out. You know, you're ahead of your hand up, right?

And then, oh, is this on this? Go ahead. What about the weaker brother? Is that part of your conscience? You're talking about what other people think?

Well, you know, you're part of a community. You're part of a community. And if you find  that you're the only one that thinks it's okay to do that. And, you know, your 25 best Christian  actor friends think it's wrong. You probably ought to think twice.

What if you're just being extra sensitive to that one, or a few people that may be offended? Your artist, you're going to be sensitive. If anybody, if anybody thinks you've done wrong, and they're really disappointed in you,  is that what you mean? In other words, you do something, and you feel like, here's a person over there. It was possible for everyone to stumble.

What defines stumble? Good question. Matt at you, think you're stupid. That's not stumbling. That's true.

You're absolutely right. When the Bible says, don't call somebody to stumble. What that really means is you should not be helping someone else do something. One of the troubles is, the actual place where this happens is Jews  were eating meat off her to idols because in their culture, an idol is nothing. Many of the pagan people had become Christians.

To them, the idols were really a big deal. They had worshipped them and so on. When they saw Jews eating meat off her to idols,  and it didn't bother them, the Gentiles said, I guess I can, and when they did it,  they felt cut off from God and terrible and all that. Paul said, what you're doing is encouraging  somebody else to do something that they just can't do in faith and don't do it, but I'm not quite  sure what that would be here. Be careful.

Stumbling doesn't just mean offend somebody,  or even upset them. Well, I can dance if that may be hard for some people who have issues  watching dance. Fine. Right. I mean, you do know from culture to culture, what is considered  authoritarian in one culture is considered, you know, is considered sort of a normal exercise  authority in what one culture, I mean, it's not what one culture considers a lascivious  another culture doesn't.

So you do ultimately, you do have to beg one another, not to try to  bind people's consciences where the Bible's left them free and just say, you know, I beg you,  if this bothers you, or if you can't do this, if it gets into your heart to be kissing somebody  for eight weeks in a row, then just don't do it. Follow your conscience. But then respect each other's  consciences. Don't say, oh, you know, you're weakling or what's the matter with you. You're not  professional.

What's the matter? Can't you be detached? Nor do the opposite and say, look at that  person who's clearly going into sin, but keep in touch with each other and ask each other,  are you really able to do that? You had your hand up, right? I'm going to go.

The Catholics right now are vastly better at supporting artists than evangelical Christians,  way, way, way past. I mean, yeah, they may have burned a few of you at the stake over the years,  but you know, come on, get, you know, let's buy gospel, buy gospel. But they were actually good. Actually, Flannery O'Connor wrote a great book called Mystery in Manors that is wonderful. It's mainly for writers, but you'd learn a lot from it.

I haven't over here. Yes, go ahead. Let me get just three of you over here. Yes, go ahead. I've seen opera now, but I started out  wanting to be an actress, and one of the things that I faced was that people at church felt that  I was only seeking glory for myself.

And I was wondering what your thoughts are on how we can  project what attitude we should have as artists and what attitude, how can we help people? If you were singing the church, that'd be different. Well, as if you're singing in the church, that's not seeking glory for yourself. I mean, think about this. I mean, have any of you ever been inquires?

Do you think there's any people inquires around the country that are seeking glory for themselves now? What about preachers? Do you think there's any preachers? I mean, everybody who's up front  is God of the danger of seeking glory for themselves. I think just what you have to say, of course,  it's a huge danger, but we don't have any more, say we have the same amount of danger of that  that the ministers do or the Christian singers do.

So nevertheless, after you  have dealt with that problem, it is a problem, by the way. I mean, you know, I have to say,  why am I really doing this? If I hone certain skills that are like acting to some degree,  I hone certain skills. It's sort of preaching as a combination. In some ways, I've got to be a good  writer.

In some ways, I've got to be a good actor. And if I hone those skills and people come out to  listen to me, you've come out to listen to me, why am I doing that? I mean, I've got the same problem  you do. I mean, it's no different. It's a big problem.

But just because you want to be an artist  or an opera singer and actor doesn't mean you've got a bigger problem than anybody else, that's all. I would not say to a Christian, oh, you can't. Again, the conscience, very important. Where is the totalization line getting drawn here? I mean, you know, there's some stuff you say  obvious.

Everybody knows, you know, there's, you know, full frontal nudity. And I mean,  there's some things to say, okay, so we start where we all agree you're not going to do. But then  what happens is as we go, what about this? What about this show? What about this show?

Next thing you  know, we're divided. Somebody say, well, I don't have a problem with that. And somebody say, we  have those conversations. And then please respect each other's decisions. And over a generation,  you could become wise as a Christian community and come to more consensus and work the thing out.

Just don't freak out over somebody. There's always somebody to your left and somebody to your right. There's always somebody who thinks you're the liberal, you know, or you're the sell-out, or there's  somebody who thinks you're the moralist, you're the legalist. I generally feel that you, like I  said, just like ministers, you gotta, you gotta take roles that at least, me, you gotta do some  things that at least are probably useless. You know, they're useless to society.

They don't really  do much of anything. I just want stuff that is really, you know, really, there is plenty of stuff  out there that is just trying to pull away traditional values. It's just after it. They're just  trying to do it. I don't want to be part of that.

But how do we know that ones there and there  talk about it with each other? Try to draw lines. You're not going to figure this out overnight. You're not going to figure out overnight. The younger you are, the more you're likely you are to do  things that you just, you know, you feel a little bad in the conscience, but I think you can do it,  but watch it and talk to each other about it.

And don't and don't violate your conscience very much. You know, once, once you know you violated it back out, when you're not sure, sometimes I can't tell  I violated it till I try and then I realize I'm over the line. Let's keep going. Yes, sure. Do I work hard?

Do I push, you know, and that element of saying, hey,  about I know you're in control of this and trusting him and then doing my part as well in terms of  what business aspect of this. And that really plus any question, but simply for acting. Well, you know, the problem with acting is that you don't get nearly as much negative. There's almost no  other career where you get so much negative assessment. You just don't get turned down.

I mean,  it's just nuts. You know, once a year, you can take a job in one of these high rates,  once a year, you sit down, you get a performance evaluation and they say, well, you're not doing  very well. Or maybe even we're going to fire you if you don't stop this and it's, you know,  and then six months later they fire you. That's a lot better than being an actor where you get all  these turn downs and being ignored. It's pretty tough.

So I, and actually I really do think it's  because of that a lot, as you all know, I guess your community is filled with people who have a lot of  a lot of emotional well fragility. Yeah, really emotionally fragile, which doesn't surprise me. I don't think I'm not sure you're emotionally fragile and therefore you want to be an actor. I think you're an actor and next thing you know, you're like, you know, but so you do need that,  but nevertheless, with any career, you have to say, when have I, should I be pushing harder,  is that why I'm not getting any further? And when do I give up and try something else?

But on the other hand, when I was in seminary, there was seminaries that train ministers,  they don't care whether you're gifted or called or going to be any good, they just didn't want  your tuition. So they're putting you through and halfway through or at the end, people are saying,  I want to be a minister and almost everybody can look and say, that person's never going to be a  minister. A person doesn't have what it takes, but nobody told them about that. So actually I  spent a good deal of time because some of you heard me do this before. I came up with a,  with a three, a tripod called Ability Affinity Opportunity and Ability means you're good and other  people think you're good.

Affinity means I'm really passionate. I love it. Opportunity means God  opens the doors. And you might say, how do I know whether or not I'm, you can't mess up your life. You can't.

Just the other day, somebody called me and said, I listened to sermon by somebody and  they seemed to indicate that the reason I'm not married is because I'm not praying enough. Okay. And I want to be married and I'm not praying enough. And so is the reason I'm not married  because I'm not praying enough and therefore I'm, I'm sinning. I said, well, you know, Jacob's  sinned.

He dressed up as he saw and he ruined his whole family and created all, you know, I just  really screwed everything up. And God used the sin to find him the family that God wanted him to have. He wouldn't had, he wouldn't have found the family wouldn't had the children. It was all through  the sin. So I said, what, what about your theory that the reason my life's not going the way  God wants it is because maybe I'm sinning.

I personally think God is so sovereign that if you sin,  if you do something wrong, there's going to be devastation in your life for a long time and it's  your fault. And yet if you sin and if you're his child and he loves you, then all those promises  are going to come to you anyway and he'll bring his blessing into your life through the sin. Now, you know, you'll spend all your life wishing you hadn't done it and you shouldn't have done it. But he's, you can't mess up your life. So don't, just don't kill yourself trying to be successful  if he's just don't.

However, if after a period of time, and I don't know how long to tell people  to wait, the affinity, ability and opportunity don't come together. There's some people who want to  do it and everybody says they can do it and the opportunity is just don't come. You're just never  the right person at the right place in the right time with the right cheekbone structure. You know how that works. You know, it has not, you know, so often it has has absolutely nothing to do  with talent, just that I'm looking for somebody your size, the your cheekbone structure, you know,  the way you wink, you know, that's the way that we want.

And next thing, you know, the career is made. You know, if that will make you a Calvinist, I don't know what will. I don't know what will. So, well, if the opportunity doesn't come, or if you, you know, unless they all come together at once  and after you've knocked and knocked and knocked and knocked, then don't be afraid that somehow you have  failed to, you've met, mucked up your life that God wanted you to be an actor and now you can't be  because you didn't try hard enough, just relax a little bit. So, in some ways, you are where everybody  else is, but I think it is mostly harder to stay at acting long term if you just don't have those  doors open.

Other people can work a lot longer at their job before they say, I'm going to try something  else. So, you do need to support each other, but in the end, I think acting, actually, most people  I know who've been actors who go do something else, it enriches their ability to do a lot of other  things. Don't think, I put all this time into it, almost almost anything else you do. Presentation  is very important and your ability to do presentation and to know how to do presenting to people will  stand you in good stead for a long time.

### 引言：在工作中寻找意义的挣扎

你是否在努力寻找工作中的意义和目的？我们大部分时间都在工作中度过，但工作往往是我们生活中感到最沮丧和无意义的领域。今天在播客中，Tim Keller 帮助我们理解福音如何让我们在职业中获得希望和喜悦。

### 故事的力量

这是一篇有着美好高潮的讲道。这是一串随机的想法。可能你从之后的问答中获得的比我现在告诉你的更多，但我认为你需要知道，如果你是基督徒，成为演员的理由是什么？你知道，为什么基督徒应该成为演员？为什么基督徒应该成为演员？从基督教的角度来看，演员有什么价值？这就是我想谈论的。

> “如果我能用一句话概括，我就不必写这个故事了。”

**演员就像耶稣使道成肉身。** 他们把一个看不见的故事变成可见的。

### 基督教的主线故事

基督教的主线故事是什么？我们认为世界的故事是什么？我们认为主要问题是什么？让我给你一个简要的概述。一切都是好的创造，但一切都因罪而堕落。一切都因罪而破碎。通过基督，一切都将被救赎。

### 演员的角色

演员是讲故事的人。他们体现故事。人们需要故事，而故事几乎是改变人们世界观、改变人们对事物理解的最佳方式。

### 基督徒演员的挑战

在这一点上，你几乎必须在别人的故事中表演。但如果你有机会自己编写并表演自己的故事，我发现关于传福音的事情很有趣...

> “除非你有一个主线故事，否则你无法为自己的人生赋予意义。”

### 结论：与文化的互动

最终，福音是上帝通过一个故事拯救了你，而不是通过一堆原则。上帝没有带着一堆原则出现并说，如果你做这些事情，你就会去天堂。发生的是，上帝通过耶稣基督进入世界，并通过他的所作所为拯救了你。他通过一个故事拯救了你，当然是一个真实的故事，而不是通过你只是顺从、去教堂和服从。

> “救赎是通过一个故事。这个故事是如此全面。它吸收了所有其他故事并解决了它们。”

所以我知道这有点令人震惊和过度。这并不夸张。我绝对相信这一点，但另一方面，我意识到这需要很多时间来消化。
