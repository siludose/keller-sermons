Welcome to Gospel in Life. You don't have to look far to see that something's deeply  wrong with our world and with us. But is there an answer that gets to the root of why?  In today's message, Tim Keller explores the human condition through stories in the Bible,  uncovering what Scripture says about sin and why it's the only explanation deep enough  to face the truth about ourselves.  We go to the next couple of weeks, four weeks actually. We're going to be looking at what  Isaiah tells us about what's wrong with us. Isaiah has some pretty fascinating things to  say because the longest, in some ways, the greatest Old Testament prophet. And what  we have here is one of the great prophecies about the Messiah and what the Messiah will  do. Isaiah 61, 1 to 11. The Spirit of the sovereign Lord is on me because the Lord has  anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the broken hearted  to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners, to proclaim  the year of the Lord's favor and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all who mourn,  and provide for those who grieve in Zion, to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead  of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit  of despair. They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the Lord for the display of  His splendor. They will rebuild the ancient ruins and restore the places long devastated.  They will renew the ruined cities that have been devastated for generations. Aliens will  shepherd your flocks, foreigners will work your fields and vineyards, and you will be  called priests of the Lord. You will be named ministers of your God. You will feed on  the wealth of nations and in their riches you will boast. Instead of their shame, my  people will receive a double portion. Instead of disgrace, they will rejoice in their inheritance.  And so they will inherit a double portion in their land, and everlasting joy will be theirs.  For I, the Lord, love justice. I hate robbery and iniquity. In my faithfulness, I will reward  them and make an everlasting covenant with them. Their descendants will be known among the nations,  and they are offspring among the peoples. All who see them will acknowledge that they are a  people. The Lord has blessed. I delight greatly in the Lord. My soul rejoices in my God,  for he has clothed me with garments of salvation, and unwrapped me in a robe of righteousness.  As a bridegroom adorns his head like a priest, and as a bride adorns yourself with  her jewels. For as the soil makes the sprout come up, and a garden causes seeds to grow,  so the sovereign Lord will make righteousness and praise spring up before all nations.  This is God's word. Now, because this is the third in the series, we need to take some stock  what we're doing, why we're doing it, where we've come. We're talking about sin,  doing a series on sin. Why? Well, because early in the century, maybe late 19th century,  early 20th century, this isn't, we can't be completely, you can't pinpoint this exactly,  basically our Western society told us to get rid of the concept of sin. To get rid of it.  And there was some pretty good reasons for it. I mean, because of the abuses, they said,  when you use the word sin and evil, when you use sin with regard to yourself, when you look at  yourself and call yourself a sinner, you just crush yourself. Just make yourself feel guilty,  you make yourself feel terrible and worthless, see? Feel ashamed. And when you call other people's  sinners, when you put sin on them, you do the same thing, you not only crush them and make them  feel shame, but it probably might lead you to abuse them. They're sinners, so you can just treat  them in all sorts of ways. So sin was considered a dangerous and unhelpful category. And the reason  at the time, there was some at least logical reason to get rid of it, was because at the very same  time, many, many people in Europe and America were saying this, they were saying, well, you know,  the troubles and the difficulties of our country and of our society, the reason people are filled with  what the reason of for violence and for oppression and for selfishness is really because of unjust  social conditions, because of bad education, because of bad environment. And through political  and social transformations and the procedure, the progress of science, we can deal with these  things. It's a much better way of putting it. And of course, it does not do so much more optimistic,  but we got a problem now. At the end of the 20th century, we've been through the Holocaust,  we've been through two world wars, and a couple years ago, a book that's really had a big impact on me,  Andrew Del Bonco, right up here at Columbia University wrote a book called The Death of Satan,  fascinating book. And he says something here, I'll read it to you. He says, a gulf has opened now  in our culture between the visibility of evil and the intellectual resources available for coping  with it. And then he puts it perfectly. We now have an inescapable problem. We feel something that  our culture no longer gives us the vocabulary to express. Now, it's pretty simple. Look, Marxism,  at least said, I know it's, we know it's wrong. You know, they had a theory what's wrong, why  the why why we're so messed up. And of course, Marxism has done as a movement. Freudianism had a  theory about what's wrong with us, but it's over with a movement, you see? The optimistic idea that  if we just educate people and we do this and that, we can deal with, you know, pressure and racism  and violence and so forth, that's over. It's gone. And Del Bonco says, but here's the weird thing.  We got rid of vocabulary. We got rid of the concept of sin. And now we see it in front of us  when we can't talk about it. We can't deal with it. We feel ourselves in the presence of something  that we no longer have the vocabulary to deal with. It's terrible. In fact, next week,  a couple weeks or now, come back and give you some examples that Del Bonco gives. I can't do that  tonight. But today, but here's the point. We have got to go back to the Bible to get the vocabulary.  And here's my proposition to you. The reason that the Bible's vocabulary concept of sin was  jettison was partly because it wasn't very well understood. The average person, if I ask you,  what's sin? You know, our memories of society about what the Bible says about sin is pretty simple.  Sin is breaking God's law. And that makes us guilty. And that's true. And actually,  I've got a sermon coming on that. But I want you to say that if you start with that,  you really don't understand that multidimensional, profound, nuancedness of the  biblical doctrine of sin. We started last week and we said, okay, first of all, sin is the first  thing is that sin is breaking God's scale. It is reducing God and that creates smallness of  spirit. It's refusing to treat him as glorious, remember? Then last week, we said, sin is not  just breaking God's scale, it's breaking God's heart. Breaking God's scale and treating him is  something less glorious than he is, making him too small, leads to strunginess of spirit. But  when you replace God, when you break his heart and you reject his love, then what you're actually  doing is you create addiction, remember that. So sin is smallness of spirit, sin is addiction.  Now, this week we're going to go, oh, still, before we get to the idea of breaking God's law,  we have to understand it's breaking God's scale. That means it's treating him as less glorious  than he is. Otherwise, you don't understand sin. It's breaking God's heart. He says, I want to be  the lover of your soul and we put ourselves in the arms of other lovers and as a result, we're  addicts. This week, we're going to look at one more before we get anywhere else and that is sin  is not just breaking God's scale, breaking God's heart. It's also breaking God's design for us.  You do not understand sin at all unless you think, unless you understand that sin is breaking God's  design. See, God's law is not just an expression of his heart, so to break God's law, you're  trampling on his heart. God's law is also, it's your design print of your heart. It's the way  you're built to work. And when you break God's law, you break yourself. You're trampling on yourself.  Let's get into this. This passage actually is telling us about that because it's telling us what  the Messiah is going to do. And the first thing it shows us is the Messiah is going to deal with the  problems of life and that shows us something about sin. So here's how we're going to break this down.  We're going to see what the problem is, what God is going to do about it and how we should respond.  What the problem is, what we should do about it, what God's going to do about it, how we should  respond. First of all, what is the problem? Right away, we have to see this is remarkable. All the  things this Messiah does and the thing that first hits you is the range of them. First of all,  take a look here. First of all, he deals with both body and soul. For example, he comes to the poor.  Collar read from Matthew 11, Jesus was very big on this passage. I'll tell you how big he was.  The first sermon he ever preached, he chose this text. Now, when you're going to start a campaign,  you're really careful what you say that first time, isn't it? Because you want to make sure it's  perfect. It perfectly conveys what you're trying to, what you're all about. When Jesus Christ  preaches very first sermon and look for, he preached on this text, Isaiah 61, 1 and 2.  The first thing it comes up, preaches the poor. That has to do with, he's dealing with economic  brokenness. But then secondly, look at, he binds up the broken hearted. He's dealing with emotional  brokenness. Then it says, look, he's released from darkness. He releases from darkness.  Now, you have to be careful because it says, proclaim freedom for the captors and release from  darkness. And those are two different things. It's not repetitious. And he's talking about  intellectual blindness. He's talking about spiritual blindness, not seeing the truth.  But then lastly, and this is, this is what it takes just a moment to massage, all right?  He says, he has been sent, he has sent me to bind up the broken hearted to proclaim freedom for  the captors and then down to the second verse to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor. Now, this  is not something you're going to get by reading it in English. What he's doing here, this person who  comes and says, the Spirit of the Lord is upon me to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord,  the year of the Lord's favor, proclaim liberty. He is quoting Leviticus 25. And Leviticus 25 is  talking about the Jubilee. And this Messianic figure is coming to say, I have come to bring  the Jubilee. What's that? Well, let me tell you, you've heard the Sabbath. You've heard that in  the Old Testament God said to the people, one day in seven Sabbath rest. But maybe you haven't  heard that he also said to the people, one year in seven must be a Sabbath year. He didn't just  institute the Sabbath day. He also instituted a Sabbath year. And a Sabbath year was this.  In those days, when someone through poor crops, poor misfortune or poor judgment, would come to  the place where you get so in debt you couldn't pay your debts off. What would happen is you would  become an indentured servant to the people that you owed. And you would become their servant.  And of course, that's the sort of thing that happened. Some people got more prosperous. Some people  didn't get as prosperous. But every seventh year, God says Sabbath. What a Sabbath? In the Sabbath  year, all debts were forgiven. All servants went free, therefore. And the land was the life  fallow which meant in order to build up its nutrients, the people were to eat out of the storehouses  and not till the field. So everybody rested. And the land rested. And you forgave your brother from  the heart, their debts. And you forgave your brother from the heart, any wrongs that you had done.  That's the Sabbath year. But then on top of that, that was in the Old Testament. You can read about  in Deuteronomy and Leviticus. But in Leviticus 25, we have one of the weirder parts of the Old  Testament. It's weird because it's so radical. And from what we can tell, it was never practiced.  And it's always the possibility that wasn't supposed to be. But here's what would happen. You said  every seven days is a Sabbath day and every seven years is a Sabbath year. But every Sabbath Sabbath.  In other words, every seven Sabbath years, which would mean the 50th year, the Jubilee year,  every seven seven of years, there was to be a Jubilee. And the Jubilee was even more extensive. Not  only were all the debts forgiven, not only were all the servants and the slaves freed.  But if you lost your land any time in that 49 years, bad crops, bad judgment, if you had lost your land,  your family's original land, it came back to you. And the whole purpose behind the Sabbath year,  and the Jubilee, was how do you make sure that if you blow it, you get a running start,  a second chance economically. How do you make sure that you don't have long-term families  getting down to the culture of poverty, learning habits that have to do with poverty, other people  getting into the culture of wealth and having those kinds of habits. How do you do that? Well,  that's how it was supposed to be done. Now, one of the things that's pretty interesting about this  is it clearly goes that the Jubilee was an institution that was not only for spiritual rest.  It wasn't only the place where you were saying, I'm going to forgive you, and God has forgiven me.  But it was also economically. I was forgiving you, and I'm going to give you so that you can come  up out of the place economically where you are. It's astounding. And it really was pretty remarkable.  And as far as we know, Israel never observed it. Can you imagine?  And the Messiah shows up and says, I bring the Jubilee.  And he not only shows that this means body and soul are going to be put together.  But if you look carefully, it also shows that he comes to not only deal with body and soul  problems, but also individual and corporate problems, because look at verse three and verse four.  In verse three, we see complete individual transformation.  I will bring you a crown of beauty. We'll get back to that.  Oil of gladness, garments of praise, and you will become oaks of righteousness. That's what it.  That's not just symbolic. Oaks of righteousness means organic righteousness. God is not just going  to declare you righteous, which he does when he wraps you in the robe of righteousness in verse 10.  But he's going to make you actually righteous. He's going to put his spirit in you.  He's going to put his nature in you. And that's what you have in verse three.  You're going to become inside out, completely transformed. But then in verse four, we see  that they're supposed to go and rebuild cities. And if you look at verse four and five,  it doesn't just say, oh, you know, forget the cities. You know, let's put up a new subdivision.  You go back and you rebuild the cities. And if you look carefully, in that city, there's going to be  racial harmony. It says, it says aliens are going to be working with you. You have to be  a little careful because the English doesn't bring it out. It says, for example, when it says the  aliens are going to shepherd your flocks, that word for shepherd doesn't just mean you. They're  going to be your hired hands. But that means that they're going to stand with you and they're going  to take responsibility with you. There's a racial harmony. There's a rebuilding of cities.  There's personal transformation. There's social transformation. There's spiritual wholeness.  There's psychological wholeness. There's economic wholeness. There's racial wholeness.  The whole nine yards. And the Messiah comes back and says, that's what I'm about to do. Now,  what does that tell us about sin? That's the first point. And here's what it tells us about sin.  The wages of sin is ashes. You notice in verse three, it says, I will put a crown of beauty on  where you have ashes. And he's thinking very literally, when somebody died or when anything went  really wrong in your life, you didn't just put on black. What you did was you put ashes. You  went into the fireplace and you picked up ashes and you put them on your forehead. And not just a  little cute little cross, you say that you put even today at Lent in many churches where you  put the ashes on there for good for Ash Wednesday. No, you poured it on your head. Think about it.  You looked ugly. You were totally dirty. And here's what you were saying. Life is like this.  The Bible, what are ashes? You put something in the fire. And the fire knocks it apart.  There's chemicals that were coherent. You put a wooden fire and there was a cohesion.  There was a coherence. It was integrated. There was all these various sorts of chemicals and various  things that turned it into wood. But what does the fire do? The fire destroys that which keeps those  things that should be together. It destroys the coherence and it goes to ashes. If you put your  hand in the fire, it'll go to ashes. If you put your paper in the fire, it'll go to ashes.  But you see, when the Messiah says, I'm going to give you beauty for ashes. He's actually referring  to everything he's been looking at in a whole survey. Because essentially life is like that.  My favorite illustration is, there's a couple of ways to put it. Think of a chicken in your oven.  You bring the chicken out. You put it on the table. Too hot to eat. So you wait for 15 minutes.  And you're happy. Why? Because now I can eat it. But the only reason you can eat it is because it's  losing energy. Because that's how life is. Leave it for three hours. Then you won't want to eat it.  It loses energy until it's kind of yucky. Leave it for three days. And now it's a help hazard.  Leave it for three weeks. But when you watch it, go to pieces. Oh, of course, if you could burn it  up, you see, in the fire, it goes to ashes very quickly. But don't you see? If you just let it be,  it's going to ashes anyway. And as you watch the chicken go to ashes, why? Because that's the way  existence is. You're looking in a mirror. You're going to ashes. If you put yourself into the fire,  you'll go to ashes very quickly. But if it doesn't matter, die at all you want. Go to the doctor  all you want, okay? Exercise all you want to keep yourself together, to keep yourself whole,  to keep yourself tight, but you're spreading. And you will continue to spread until finally,  you are ashes. You are dust, dust thou art, ashes thou art. Now what are we talking about here?  The Bible says that the whole world is burning in a flame of sin. That when I want to be my own master,  when I want to be my own Lord, when I want to be my own Savior, what I'm just doing essentially  is I put fire, sin is fire against the design that God has for the way He wants things to be,  which is peace, flourishing, growth, shalom, which is the Hebrew word for peace, but it means  every kind of human flourishing. Now you can get this down into the micro. Can I get it out of  the micro? Somebody treats you bad. And you say, I'm not going to forgive. I will not forgive.  And some of you are in this situation right now, right now. The Bible says God says, I forgive,  therefore you must forgive you must forgive. That's the word of God. If you don't forgive,  that's a sin. Now let's think about this for a second. All right. If you sin, what are the  consequences of sin? Well, a lot of people say, I'm just scared, you know, maybe God won't answer my  prayer if I keep my sin in my heart. Maybe that's that. Well, it does say that. Okay. So maybe you  think of sin like this. I better not sin because God's sort of watching me. And as long as I stay  sinful, you know, God's going to get me. He's going to watch me say, boy, that person's sinning,  what can I do to make their life miserable today? But boy, you misunderstand. You misunderstand.  When you hold that grudge, the doctor will tell you that that's that is actually turning up the flame  on your heart. You're much more likely to have heart problems. You're much more likely to  stomach problems. You're much more likely to have physical problems because you're mad. But not only  that, of course, you start to break down psychologically. You'll be in denial. It'll control you.  But, of course, it breaks you down spiritually. Sin disintegrates us. Sin makes us break down.  Sin puts, sin is an invisible flame. It's visible to God. Oh God sees it. God looks down and he sees  us all on fire. He sees us all fall into part. Why? Because what we're doing is we're going against  our design. Whenever you want to be your own savior, your own master, it's not like oh gosh, you  know, here I did what I shouldn't have done today. I wonder where the God's going to get me.  Sin is guilty, but sin is, first of all, stupid. Sin does break God's law, but God's law is simply  the way he built you. He built you to love, not to hate. He built you to be unselfish, not to be  selfish. He built you not to spend all your money on yourself. That's the reason why he says,  give it away. He built you to forgive. That's why he says forgive. He built you to have sex inside.  A covenant of marriage. That's why he says to do that. None of this is busy work. This is not like  my eighth grade algebra teacher. You used to say, well, you know, kids got to be still off the street.  So as you say, do all these things to keep you off the street. That's busy work. There's no busy work  in the will of God. God comes and says, I built you this way. You will only flourish. If you break  this, you break yourself. If you trample on this, you're trampling on your own heart. If you're  trampling on this, you're trampling on your own world. And every time you send you just turning the  flame up, turning up the burner, and you go to ashes faster, do you see that? Everywhere we look,  we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache. We feel it in the world around us and in our own  lives. How did it get this way? And what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing  this month, what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer.  Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer, Dr. Keller shows how the reality of sin  explains the pain we see all around us, and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing.  Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes or choices  or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world will help you see how the gospel speaks  to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us. This newly released book What  Is Wrong with the World is our thanks for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the  good news of Jesus.

Let me tell you what the positive part is. The positive part is the Messiah comes  to deal with all the results of sin. The Messiah comes not look at Messiah does not come only to  forgive your sins, give you peace in your in your little heart, and take you to heaven. The Messiah  does not come to earth and say, let me take you away from all this. He doesn't do that. Instead,  he says I'm going to give you a joy and a power so we can rehab the world.  I can give you a I'm going to bring you a joy and a power inside. I'm going to remake you inside  so we can remake the whole world together. My power, my spirit, my goal is not just simply to take  you into some other world of esoteric consciousness. Listen, every other religion says that.  Eastern and Western, what's the ideal? What's the ideal? Paradise or the all-soul or something like  that. That's never what Christianity or Judaism has ever talked about. It talks about the new  heavens. It talks about the new earth. It means matter is good. Jesus didn't just die to save our souls.  He also rose to save our bodies. What else is the resurrection for?  Therefore, when the Messiah comes, he's going to say, I have come back to make things whole. I've  come back to, first of all, turn off the fire and then to rebuild everything, restore everything,  say, reweave everything, make everything whole. That's what he's after. That's the only way  you can understand so many of the prophecies of Isaiah. That's the problem. Now, how is God going  to do that? And the answer is here in this tremendous Messiah. Now, this Messiah, in verse 1,  again, I have to give you a little help. It doesn't hit you right away as an English reader so much.  But anyway, this particular Messiah, right away, we're told the spirit of the sovereign  Lord is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach. Now, before we go on any further,  the Lord has anointed me to preach. Now, this is what that's saying. If you really read all of  Isaiah, and you know, it's very hard, and I want to admit, I don't want anybody to go away feeling  guilty because it's too hard. It's very hard to read Isaiah. It's a long book. But I didn't realize  until because of you, because I had to do this for you, I had to read the whole book. For the first  of my life, I realized that there is a narrative, and there's an enormous crisis coming up to chapter  61 when you read the book. Because in the early part of the book of Isaiah, we're told that there's  going to be this strong, incredible, Davidic king, someone who's going to raise a banner. In fact,  in Isaiah 11, verses 1 and 2, it says, this great king is going to come and he's going to raise a  banner and he's going to be glorious and he's going to summons the nation and he's going to put  down all evil and he's going to make the whole world right. And it says, the spirit of the Lord will  be upon him to do this. And so this is a reference to Psalm 2, Isaiah 11. And that makes sense to us.  They say, yes, the world is a mess. We need somebody to come in and deliver us. But then in the  middle part of Isaiah, starting in Isaiah 42, suddenly a new figure appears in these prophecies.  And this figure is utterly unlike the old, the anointed king of the earlier chapters.  Utterly unlike the anointed king, this is what's called in the literature, the servant. And in  Isaiah 42, Isaiah 49, Isaiah 50, and Isaiah 53, we're going to go next week. A new figure arises.  And we're told that he's not attractive. He's totally unlike the anointed conqueror.  The anointed conqueror is glorious and we all want him. This one we're told, Isaiah 53 has no  beauty. No beauty with which we should desire him. And we're told, of course, the great anointed  conqueror is going to go on to victory. However, this figure is going to suffer. This figure is  utterly unstrong. What do we tell about this figure? We're told he had no beauty that we should  desire him, but we're also told as a lamb before her shearers is silent. So he opened not his mouth.  And he was led to slaughter. He's likened to a little lamb. He's likened to a female lamb. He's  likened to one of the most weak little creatures in the animal kingdom. And so this is a person  who's utterly different. Then the first person, why is Isaiah doing this? What's going on? Who is this  person? But we're told in Isaiah 42, verse one, that this servant is the one who is anointed by  the spirit. And this is the reason why when you come to Isaiah chapter 61, first one, if you've  been reading it all along and especially been reading in Hebrew, which is what they originally did,  you suddenly, your jaw drops, hits the top of your chest. You can't believe it because up to now,  you've either had somebody who's suffering and sweet and nice and sacrificing and ugly and  defeated, or you have this incredibly, you know, this conqueror, this strong one, this glorious  one, this beautiful one. And suddenly, we see that they're the same person. As Isaiah 61 says,  this is the same one because not only does he proclaim freedom to the captives, he binds up to broken  hearted. The warrior is a nurse. How could this be the same person? But Isaiah says, this is my  breakthrough. This is my theological breakthrough. This is what the Lord has shown me.  The victory will be a defeat. The strong one will be incredibly weak. The salvation will happen  not by you, summonsing up your strength and obeying this great king. It will happen because  this great king will become incredibly weak and suffer and be defeated and die. Now,  somebody says, how could that be? Why would that be? I don't get it. And here's the answer,  in verse three, three little words instead. Three little words instead. It says, I will provide for  those who grieve in Zion to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes that oil of gladness  instead of mourning and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. Now, that's not too  bad a translation. It kind of gets at it. But basically, what we're told is that the Messiah is  not just simply saying, you've got your ashes. Let me put a crown of beauty on top of your ashes,  right? He's not saying, you've got your, you know, you have your, your mourning, but let me,  let me put oil on top of you. No, he's saying, I'll give you what I've got. You give me what you've  got. What we have here is the principle of substitution. And all of a sudden, we realize why he's not  beautiful. Why isn't he beautiful? Because we got his beauty. He gets our ashes.  Why are we joyful? Because he got his joy. He gets our despair. This is the reason why on the cross,  he cries out, my God, my God, why has nothing for sake? I mean, that's despair. We got his despair.  Pardon me. He got our despair. You see that? This means he'd have to be so incredibly strong.  Don't you see? It's one thing if you are a lamb to face your shears and or to fit in at your  shears. It's one thing if you are a lamb to face the people who are about to kill you.  You see, with a certain poise, it's another thing when you're not a lamb to become a lamb.  It's one thing if you are ugly to live with it. It's another thing if you're beautiful,  the voluntarily become ugly. Somebody else can be beautiful. Do you see what's going on here?  Behold the beauty of his voluntary ugliness. Behold the strength of his voluntary weakness.  He had to be that strong. He had to be the first figure if he could in order to be the second figure.  And of course, being the second figure, he wasn't something that he was something he had to do.  He did it for us. And therefore, substitution. Jesus Christ, when he comes to earth,  is able to deal with the fire of sin because he personally has to go through every aspect  of the devastation of sin. He is physically broken. That's the reason why he gets ashes.  He is psychologically broken. That's why he gets mourning. And he spiritually broken in that  the father cuts him off. He's like, God, my God, why I stop forsaking me so he gets the spirit of despair.  Now, what does that mean for us practically? Let's get to that. Let's make a little list.  How should we respond? Number one, please trust him. Now, here's what I'm saying.  The first thing is, look at verse 11, the soil is what grows the sapling. Do you see that?  If I take an acorn and I hold it in my hand, I can walk around for years and years and years.  You know what's going to happen? Nothing. Why? Because it's the soil that gives the power of growth  to the acorn or at least opens up the power of growth in the acorn. It's the soil. It's the nutrients.  It's the moisture. If I just hold on to it, I just walk around all the time with it.  Nothing. And verse 11 says, as the soil  will finally turn us from ashes, you know, without the soil, eventually the acorn will go to ashes.  If I just carry it around, eventually just fall apart. It has to be planted. So what we're being  told is the sovereignty of the Lord. That word sovereign Lord is pretty unusual. Sovereign means  the kingliness of the king. That is the soil in which your soul can grow. Obedience to him.  Now you see, if we only knew that he was the king of the first part of Isaiah and not the king of  the second part of Isaiah, I know you couldn't handle it, but a lot of us can't handle it anyway.  Let me be real honest. A lot of you say I would like something from God. I'm afraid to say I submit.  I'm afraid to say I surrender. I'm just afraid.  And I know why, because there's a part of your heart that says,  if I really, really say to God, anything you say, I will do, anything you send, I'll accept.  See, that's submitting. That's going under the soil. That's putting your soul under the  sovereignty of him. To say anything you tell me, no matter how I feel about it, I'll do.  No matter what it looks like, practically, I'll do. And then whatever you send me, I will accept.  That's putting yourself underneath the soil. We're being told it's his kingship that your soul needs.  You'll never grow until that happens. The fire will never start to be turned. The burner won't be  turned down until that happens. And you know what, a lot of you are saying, I'm scared to do that.  Of course, he might ask me to do something I don't want to do. Well, of course, Abraham didn't want to  take Isaac up the hill. Jesus didn't want to go to the cross. I'm not saying he won't ask you  something you don't want to do. Of course, he's going to do that. But unless Jesus says, unless  the seed falls into the ground and dies, it cannot bear fruit. Ironically, the seed can either  die underground. And it becomes something great and beautiful. It can die above ground, but it's  going to die one way or the other and you're going to die one way or the other. You can either be  your own master and your own Lord. And you'll go to ashes or you can die to your will. You can  die to leading your own life your own way. You want to go under? I will do whatever you say.  Whatever I see your will is I will do no matter what. Whatever you send me, I will accept.  And verse 1 says, the sovereignty of the king. You can trust him. Verse 11 says, the sovereignty  of the king. It will grow you, but the whole passage is saying, but this is the king who went under  for you. This is the king who lost everything for you. Think about what you, what might you give up?  If you really say, I am going to give myself to Jesus Christ utterly. Sure you're going to give  up some things. You think you're going to give up anything like what he gave up? He says, if you  give up these things, all you're going to give up is this, if you give up your rights, you'll  give up your despair. If you give up your rights, you'll give up your ashes. I took your ashes.  You're going to get nothing but beauty from me. I took your morning. You're going to get nothing  but co-adness from me. Don't you see? That's the first thing. The warrior is a nurse.  Go under. That's the first thing. Second thing. Very important. Unless you see that he's  both the suffering servant and the great Lord, you can't become a Christian. You know why?  You see, if you just think of him as this great Lord, I'm going to obey. I'm just going to obey.  That's not what makes you a Christian. What makes you a Christian is verse 10. This is Isaiah  beginning to speak. Isaiah actually gives us the prophecy. It's the Messiah who's speaking.  Jesus Christ who's speaking. But when you get down there to verse 8 and 9, suddenly you see, look  it. Suddenly Isaiah begins to speak. He begins to speak about this and here's what Isaiah says.  He has robed me. In fact, I deviated from the NIV. He has wrapped me in a robe of righteousness.  What does it mean to become a Christian? It means to not say, I'm strong enough and I can follow the  king. I'll obey. Then I'll get his blessing. Oh no, no. We have to see it. He's stronger than that.  He's stronger than that. We do not just have a king who comes to this follow me. We have a king who  first comes and says, I'm going to die. I'm going to be everything you need to be. I'm going to  substitute for you. So I don't ask you to achieve a righteousness. I'm going to give you a righteousness.  I'm going to plant it in your heart. I'm going to wrap it around your body and your soul.  You're going to get my righteousness, my gladness, see? My beauty. That's what you're going to get.  And so you're not a Christian, if you say, I'm going to try from now on to really live a good life.  That's not really dying, by the way. You may think, oh, I'm no longer my own Lord,  but you're your own Savior. And if you're your own Savior, you are your own Lord. You have to  willing to say, I give up my rights to my own life because you have done everything for me except  me. Oh, Father, for what Jesus has done. That'll make you a Christian. You've got to put the two  together or you can't become a Christian. Thirdly, Christian friends, until you see that he's both the  conquering hero, conquering the anointed conqueror and the suffering servant. You're not going to  understand actually even the way he deals with you in your own life. Here's one thing that I know.  Sometimes I do something very stupid and God just gets me off the hook. He just, you know, I say,  I did something very stupid. Please help me. And somehow he shields me. He lets it go, okay, right?  So sometimes it's just something really stupid and everything's fine. And other times I do just  the tiniest little sort of stupid thing. And wham, wham, wham, wham. You say,  hit me again, Lord. I'm still breathing. Why would that be? I never forget when I listen to a  tape by Dick Lucas on John 11 where Jesus comes to the tomb of Lazarus and two sisters come out  to him. Do you remember this? Martha comes and says, if you had been here, my brother Lazarus  wouldn't have died. Okay. And like three verses later, Mary comes to him, the other sister  and says, if my brother, if you had been here, my brother Lazarus wouldn't have died. If you look  carefully, it's the same words. It's the same spot. It's the same circumstance. It's the same  condition. My goodness. It's the women who their names both start with MA. I mean, everything's the  same. And in the first case, what does Jesus do? He says to Martha, Martha, I am the resurrection  in the life. It's really in the face. I know when we read it, we hear, I am the resurrection in the  life. He who, you know, yeah, but look at the context. He's sort of, he's, he's getting Martha  like this. He's really saying, Martha, I am the resurrection in the life. If I had been here,  when I'm here, you live. It doesn't matter when. He said, I am the resurrection in the life. So  he's kind of confronting her. But when Mary comes up, says the same question, makes the same statement,  excuse me, comes after him in the same way. What does he do? Do you remember? He just weeps.  See, the first time he gives the ministry of truth and the second time he gives the ministry of  tears, one time he just kind of wham and the other time he just listens. Now, you know why?  Because the warrior is a nurse. He is the wonderful counselor. You and I, any, every, some of your  counselors, aren't you? You're not perfect. I know. I've tried so hard to be a perfect counselor.  And here's the problem. Sometimes where I really need to just listen and patient and hold their  hand and instead I confront them, doesn't go right. They really need to be listened to. And other times  I listen and listen and listen and listen and I should have confronted them. I mean, I tend to confront  when I should be listening. I listen when I should confront. Sometimes I do the ministry of truth  when it should be just the ministry of tears. Other times I do the ministry of tears when I really  should be doing a ministry of truth. But Jesus is always spot on. And that's the only reason why  he seems like a schizophrenic to you. Because he knows exactly what you need when you need it.  And there's times in which for some reason he just comes in and he sort of lifts the ship and takes  you right on through. And other times he just, other times he seems to completely abandon you. Why?  He's the perfect counselor. He's the warrior and a nurse. He'll change your bedpan.  He'll punch you in the chops. See, nurses very often can't do that or they don't want to do that.  They're not that kind of person. And wires, obviously, also can't change bedpounds. They're not  kind of that kind of person. But our savior is the wonderful counselor. See, the wonderful counselor,  mighty God, everlasting father, Prince of Peace, the whole thing.  Fourth. When Jesus Christ preached this text, he says, listen, he gets to the middle of the verse  and he says, the year of the Lord's favor. In other words, when Jesus Christ preached this, he got up  and he says, the spirit of the Lord is upon me, right? Because the Lord has anointed me to preach  good news of the poor. He has sent me to bind the broken hearted to proclaim freedom for the  captives and release from the darkness for the prisoners to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.  And he stopped right in the middle of the sentence, right in the middle of the verse. And he sat  down and he says today, it begins. Well, why didn't he go on to this less part of this passage here?  Why in the world didn't he come on and say, and the day of the Lord's vengeance? What's a matter with  Jesus? And here's the answer. It's pretty clear that they're not the same thing.  There's a day of vengeance coming. There's a day of judgment coming. But it's pretty intriguing  that Isaiah, the Messiah here in Isaiah says, I've come to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor  and the day of vengeance. That means there's a period of time that's called the Jubilee.  But eventually it'll be over and it'll be a day of judgment. And this is really simply what  Jesus is saying. Jesus is saying, not seize the day. Jesus saying the Christians seize the year.  Now what's that mean? It means from now, my first coming to my second coming, I want you to live  on the principles of the Jubilee. From what we can tell, when Jesus Christ preached this in the very  first time, and he literally said, I've come to declare the Jubilee, there is no indication  that he tried to set up a social program in Israel. He didn't say, look, we've got to go back  and everybody's got to get their old land, but he didn't do that. On the other hand,  he didn't do that. On the other hand, it is silly to think that he is really talking about  his only spiritually. That is not what the text, that's not what Leviticus 25 is like. And here's  my best answer. A New Testament scholar named NT Wright has a really good passage on this in one  of his books. And he says, Jesus Christ is calling Christians between the first and second coming of  Christ to live themselves on the Jubilee principle. That means Jesus is coming and saying,  my kingdom of God, my kingdom is here partially but not fully. And I want you to begin to sacrifice.  I want you to be radically generous with each other. I want you to forgive each other to your debts.  I want you to create a community in which people really lay themselves out for the poor.  I want you, a community in which you really lay yourself out for the brokenhearted.  I want you to say because of what you've done for me, I am now going to be working  to bind up people in every way. I'm going to try to bring them to Christ spiritually. I'm going to try  to bring them together and bind up themselves psychologically. I'm going to try to bring them up  socially and economically. If they're poor, I'm going to do everything I can. Does that mean I'm  going to have to be spending money? I'm going to be giving a lot of my money away. Does it mean I'm  going to be involved in people's lives? Yes. Jesus is not saying Christians get into power and  make the Jubilee the program. But that hasn't worked. That's not the point. It doesn't mean that  Christians shouldn't be working for justice in society in general. Yes. But what he is saying is  let's not get out from under this. Christians now redeemer. You right now begin to live on the  principles of the Jubilee. That means forgive each other spiritually and also means be unbelievably  generous with each other in every way. Bring each other into each other's homes.  Thanks for joining us here on The Gospel and Life Podcast. We hope that today's teaching  encouraged you to go deeper into God's word.
