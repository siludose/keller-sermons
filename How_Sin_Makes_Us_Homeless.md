today's message, Tim Keller explores the human condition through stories in the Bible,  uncovering what Scripture says about sin and why it's the only explanation deep enough  to face the truth about ourselves. We go to the next couple of weeks, four weeks actually. We're going to be looking at what  Isaiah tells us about what's wrong with us. Isaiah has some pretty fascinating things to  say because the longest, in some ways, the greatest Old Testament prophet. And what  we have here is one of the great prophecies about the Messiah and what the Messiah will  do.

Isaiah 61, 1 to 11. The Spirit of the sovereign Lord is on me because the Lord has  anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the broken hearted  to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners, to proclaim  the year of the Lord's favor and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all who mourn,  and provide for those who grieve in Zion, to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead  of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit  of despair. They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the Lord for the display of  His splendor. They will rebuild the ancient ruins and restore the places long devastated.

They will renew the ruined cities that have been devastated for generations. Aliens will  shepherd your flocks, foreigners will work your fields and vineyards, and you will be  called priests of the Lord. You will be named ministers of your God. You will feed on  the wealth of nations and in their riches you will boast. Instead of their shame, my  people will receive a double portion.

Instead of disgrace, they will rejoice in their inheritance. And so they will inherit a double portion in their land, and everlasting joy will be theirs. For I, the Lord, love justice. I hate robbery and iniquity. In my faithfulness, I will reward  them and make an everlasting covenant with them.

Their descendants will be known among the nations,  and they are offspring among the peoples. All who see them will acknowledge that they are a  people. The Lord has blessed. I delight greatly in the Lord. My soul rejoices in my God,  for he has clothed me with garments of salvation, and unwrapped me in a robe of righteousness.

As a bridegroom adorns his head like a priest, and as a bride adorns yourself with  her jewels. For as the soil makes the sprout come up, and a garden causes seeds to grow,  so the sovereign Lord will make righteousness and praise spring up before all nations. This is God's word. Now, because this is the third in the series, we need to take some stock  what we're doing, why we're doing it, where we've come. We're talking about sin,  doing a series on sin.

Why? Well, because early in the century, maybe late 19th century,  early 20th century, this isn't, we can't be completely, you can't pinpoint this exactly,  basically our Western society told us to get rid of the concept of sin. To get rid of it. And there was some pretty good reasons for it. I mean, because of the abuses, they said,  when you use the word sin and evil, when you use sin with regard to yourself, when you look at  yourself and call yourself a sinner, you just crush yourself.

Just make yourself feel guilty,  you make yourself feel terrible and worthless, see? Feel ashamed. And when you call other people's  sinners, when you put sin on them, you do the same thing, you not only crush them and make them  feel shame, but it probably might lead you to abuse them. They're sinners, so you can just treat  them in all sorts of ways. So sin was considered a dangerous and unhelpful category.

And the reason  at the time, there was some at least logical reason to get rid of it, was because at the very same  time, many, many people in Europe and America were saying this, they were saying, well, you know,  the troubles and the difficulties of our country and of our society, the reason people are filled with  what the reason of for violence and for oppression and for selfishness is really because of unjust  social conditions, because of bad education, because of bad environment. And through political  and social transformations and the procedure, the progress of science, we can deal with these  things. It's a much better way of putting it. And of course, it does not do so much more optimistic,  but we got a problem now. At the end of the 20th century, we've been through the Holocaust,  we've been through two world wars, and a couple years ago, a book that's really had a big impact on me,  Andrew Del Bonco, right up here at Columbia University wrote a book called The Death of Satan,  fascinating book.

And he says something here, I'll read it to you. He says, a gulf has opened now  in our culture between the visibility of evil and the intellectual resources available for coping  with it. And then he puts it perfectly. We now have an inescapable problem. We feel something that  our culture no longer gives us the vocabulary to express.

Now, it's pretty simple. Look, Marxism,  at least said, I know it's, we know it's wrong. You know, they had a theory what's wrong, why  the why why we're so messed up. And of course, Marxism has done as a movement. Freudianism had a  theory about what's wrong with us, but it's over with a movement, you see?

The optimistic idea that  if we just educate people and we do this and that, we can deal with, you know, pressure and racism  and violence and so forth, that's over. It's gone. And Del Bonco says, but here's the weird thing. We got rid of vocabulary. We got rid of the concept of sin.

And now we see it in front of us  when we can't talk about it. We can't deal with it. We feel ourselves in the presence of something  that we no longer have the vocabulary to deal with. It's terrible. In fact, next week,  a couple weeks or now, come back and give you some examples that Del Bonco gives.

I can't do that  tonight. But today, but here's the point. We have got to go back to the Bible to get the vocabulary. And here's my proposition to you. The reason that the Bible's vocabulary concept of sin was  jettison was partly because it wasn't very well understood.

The average person, if I ask you,  what's sin? You know, our memories of society about what the Bible says about sin is pretty simple. Sin is breaking God's law. And that makes us guilty. And that's true.

And actually,  I've got a sermon coming on that. But I want you to say that if you start with that,  you really don't understand that multidimensional, profound, nuancedness of the  biblical doctrine of sin. We started last week and we said, okay, first of all, sin is the first  thing is that sin is breaking God's scale. It is reducing God and that creates smallness of  spirit. It's refusing to treat him as glorious, remember?

Then last week, we said, sin is not  just breaking God's scale, it's breaking God's heart. Breaking God's scale and treating him is  something less glorious than he is, making him too small, leads to strunginess of spirit. But  when you replace God, when you break his heart and you reject his love, then what you're actually  doing is you create addiction, remember that. So sin is smallness of spirit, sin is addiction. Now, this week we're going to go, oh, still, before we get to the idea of breaking God's law,  we have to understand it's breaking God's scale.

That means it's treating him as less glorious  than he is. Otherwise, you don't understand sin. It's breaking God's heart. He says, I want to be  the lover of your soul and we put ourselves in the arms of other lovers and as a result, we're  addicts. This week, we're going to look at one more before we get anywhere else and that is sin  is not just breaking God's scale, breaking God's heart.

It's also breaking God's design for us. You do not understand sin at all unless you think, unless you understand that sin is breaking God's  design. See, God's law is not just an expression of his heart, so to break God's law, you're  trampling on his heart. God's law is also, it's your design print of your heart. It's the way  you're built to work.

And when you break God's law, you break yourself. You're trampling on yourself. Let's get into this. This passage actually is telling us about that because it's telling us what  the Messiah is going to do. And the first thing it shows us is the Messiah is going to deal with the  problems of life and that shows us something about sin.

So here's how we're going to break this down. We're going to see what the problem is, what God is going to do about it and how we should respond. What the problem is, what we should do about it, what God's going to do about it, how we should  respond. First of all, what is the problem? Right away, we have to see this is remarkable.

All the  things this Messiah does and the thing that first hits you is the range of them. First of all,  take a look here. First of all, he deals with both body and soul. For example, he comes to the poor. Collar read from Matthew 11, Jesus was very big on this passage.

I'll tell you how big he was. The first sermon he ever preached, he chose this text. Now, when you're going to start a campaign,  you're really careful what you say that first time, isn't it? Because you want to make sure it's  perfect. It perfectly conveys what you're trying to, what you're all about.

When Jesus Christ  preaches very first sermon and look for, he preached on this text, Isaiah 61, 1 and 2. The first thing it comes up, preaches the poor. That has to do with, he's dealing with economic  brokenness. But then secondly, look at, he binds up the broken hearted. He's dealing with emotional  brokenness.

Then it says, look, he's released from darkness. He releases from darkness. Now, you have to be careful because it says, proclaim freedom for the captors and release from  darkness. And those are two different things. It's not repetitious.

And he's talking about  intellectual blindness. He's talking about spiritual blindness, not seeing the truth. But then lastly, and this is, this is what it takes just a moment to massage, all right? He says, he has been sent, he has sent me to bind up the broken hearted to proclaim freedom for  the captors and then down to the second verse to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor. Now, this  is not something you're going to get by reading it in English.

What he's doing here, this person who  comes and says, the Spirit of the Lord is upon me to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord,  the year of the Lord's favor, proclaim liberty. He is quoting Leviticus 25. And Leviticus 25 is  talking about the Jubilee. And this Messianic figure is coming to say, I have come to bring  the Jubilee. What's that?

Well, let me tell you, you've heard the Sabbath. You've heard that in  the Old Testament God said to the people, one day in seven Sabbath rest. But maybe you haven't  heard that he also said to the people, one year in seven must be a Sabbath year. He didn't just  institute the Sabbath day. He also instituted a Sabbath year.

And a Sabbath year was this. In those days, when someone through poor crops, poor misfortune or poor judgment, would come to  the place where you get so in debt you couldn't pay your debts off. What would happen is you would  become an indentured servant to the people that you owed. And you would become their servant. And of course, that's the sort of thing that happened.

Some people got more prosperous. Some people  didn't get as prosperous. But every seventh year, God says Sabbath. What a Sabbath? In the Sabbath  year, all debts were forgiven.

All servants went free, therefore. And the land was the life  fallow which meant in order to build up its nutrients, the people were to eat out of the storehouses  and not till the field. So everybody rested. And the land rested. And you forgave your brother from  the heart, their debts.

And you forgave your brother from the heart, any wrongs that you had done. That's the Sabbath year. But then on top of that, that was in the Old Testament. You can read about  in Deuteronomy and Leviticus. But in Leviticus 25, we have one of the weirder parts of the Old  Testament.

It's weird because it's so radical. And from what we can tell, it was never practiced. And it's always the possibility that wasn't supposed to be. But here's what would happen. You said  every seven days is a Sabbath day and every seven years is a Sabbath year.

But every Sabbath Sabbath. In other words, every seven Sabbath years, which would mean the 50th year, the Jubilee year,  every seven seven of years, there was to be a Jubilee. And the Jubilee was even more extensive. Not  only were all the debts forgiven, not only were all the servants and the slaves freed. But if you lost your land any time in that 49 years, bad crops, bad judgment, if you had lost your land,  your family's original land, it came back to you.

And the whole purpose behind the Sabbath year,  and the Jubilee, was how do you make sure that if you blow it, you get a running start,  a second chance economically. How do you make sure that you don't have long-term families  getting down to the culture of poverty, learning habits that have to do with poverty, other people  getting into the culture of wealth and having those kinds of habits. How do you do that? Well,  that's how it was supposed to be done. Now, one of the things that's pretty interesting about this  is it clearly goes that the Jubilee was an institution that was not only for spiritual rest.

It wasn't only the place where you were saying, I'm going to forgive you, and God has forgiven me. But it was also economically. I was forgiving you, and I'm going to give you so that you can come  up out of the place economically where you are. It's astounding. And it really was pretty remarkable.

And as far as we know, Israel never observed it. Can you imagine? And the Messiah shows up and says, I bring the Jubilee. And he not only shows that this means body and soul are going to be put together. But if you look carefully, it also shows that he comes to not only deal with body and soul  problems, but also individual and corporate problems, because look at verse three and verse four.

In verse three, we see complete individual transformation. I will bring you a crown of beauty. We'll get back to that. Oil of gladness, garments of praise, and you will become oaks of righteousness. That's what it.

That's not just symbolic. Oaks of righteousness means organic righteousness. God is not just going  to declare you righteous, which he does when he wraps you in the robe of righteousness in verse 10. But he's going to make you actually righteous. He's going to put his spirit in you.

He's going to put his nature in you. And that's what you have in verse three. You're going to become inside out, completely transformed. But then in verse four, we see  that they're supposed to go and rebuild cities. And if you look at verse four and five,  it doesn't just say, oh, you know, forget the cities.

You know, let's put up a new subdivision. You go back and you rebuild the cities. And if you look carefully, in that city, there's going to be  racial harmony. It says, it says aliens are going to be working with you. You have to be  a little careful because the English doesn't bring it out.

It says, for example, when it says the  aliens are going to shepherd your flocks, that word for shepherd doesn't just mean you. They're  going to be your hired hands. But that means that they're going to stand with you and they're going  to take responsibility with you. There's a racial harmony. There's a rebuilding of cities.

There's personal transformation. There's social transformation. There's spiritual wholeness. There's psychological wholeness. There's economic wholeness.

There's racial wholeness. The whole nine yards. And the Messiah comes back and says, that's what I'm about to do. Now,  what does that tell us about sin? That's the first point.

And here's what it tells us about sin. The wages of sin is ashes. You notice in verse three, it says, I will put a crown of beauty on  where you have ashes. And he's thinking very literally, when somebody died or when anything went  really wrong in your life, you didn't just put on black. What you did was you put ashes.

You  went into the fireplace and you picked up ashes and you put them on your forehead. And not just a  little cute little cross, you say that you put even today at Lent in many churches where you  put the ashes on there for good for Ash Wednesday. No, you poured it on your head. Think about it. You looked ugly.

You were totally dirty. And here's what you were saying. Life is like this. The Bible, what are ashes? You put something in the fire.

And the fire knocks it apart. There's chemicals that were coherent. You put a wooden fire and there was a cohesion. There was a coherence. It was integrated.

There was all these various sorts of chemicals and various  things that turned it into wood. But what does the fire do? The fire destroys that which keeps those  things that should be together. It destroys the coherence and it goes to ashes. If you put your  hand in the fire, it'll go to ashes.

If you put your paper in the fire, it'll go to ashes. But you see, when the Messiah says, I'm going to give you beauty for ashes. He's actually referring  to everything he's been looking at in a whole survey. Because essentially life is like that. My favorite illustration is, there's a couple of ways to put it.

Think of a chicken in your oven. You bring the chicken out. You put it on the table. Too hot to eat. So you wait for 15 minutes.

And you're happy. Why? Because now I can eat it. But the only reason you can eat it is because it's  losing energy. Because that's how life is.

Leave it for three hours. Then you won't want to eat it. It loses energy until it's kind of yucky. Leave it for three days. And now it's a help hazard.

Leave it for three weeks. But when you watch it, go to pieces. Oh, of course, if you could burn it  up, you see, in the fire, it goes to ashes very quickly. But don't you see? If you just let it be,  it's going to ashes anyway.

And as you watch the chicken go to ashes, why? Because that's the way  existence is. You're looking in a mirror. You're going to ashes. If you put yourself into the fire,  you'll go to ashes very quickly.

But if it doesn't matter, die at all you want. Go to the doctor  all you want, okay? Exercise all you want to keep yourself together, to keep yourself whole,  to keep yourself tight, but you're spreading. And you will continue to spread until finally,  you are ashes. You are dust, dust thou art, ashes thou art.

Now what are we talking about here? The Bible says that the whole world is burning in a flame of sin. That when I want to be my own master,  when I want to be my own Lord, when I want to be my own Savior, what I'm just doing essentially  is I put fire, sin is fire against the design that God has for the way He wants things to be,  which is peace, flourishing, growth, shalom, which is the Hebrew word for peace, but it means  every kind of human flourishing. Now you can get this down into the micro. Can I get it out of  the micro?

Somebody treats you bad. And you say, I'm not going to forgive. I will not forgive. And some of you are in this situation right now, right now. The Bible says God says, I forgive,  therefore you must forgive you must forgive.

That's the word of God. If you don't forgive,  that's a sin. Now let's think about this for a second. All right. If you sin, what are the  consequences of sin?

Well, a lot of people say, I'm just scared, you know, maybe God won't answer my  prayer if I keep my sin in my heart. Maybe that's that. Well, it does say that. Okay. So maybe you  think of sin like this.

I better not sin because God's sort of watching me. And as long as I stay  sinful, you know, God's going to get me. He's going to watch me say, boy, that person's sinning,  what can I do to make their life miserable today? But boy, you misunderstand. You misunderstand.

When you hold that grudge, the doctor will tell you that that's that is actually turning up the flame  on your heart. You're much more likely to have heart problems. You're much more likely to  stomach problems. You're much more likely to have physical problems because you're mad. But not only  that, of course, you start to break down psychologically.

You'll be in denial. It'll control you. But, of course, it breaks you down spiritually. Sin disintegrates us. Sin makes us break down.

Sin puts, sin is an invisible flame. It's visible to God. Oh God sees it. God looks down and he sees  us all on fire. He sees us all fall into part.

Why? Because what we're doing is we're going against  our design. Whenever you want to be your own savior, your own master, it's not like oh gosh, you  know, here I did what I shouldn't have done today. I wonder where the God's going to get me. Sin is guilty, but sin is, first of all, stupid.

Sin does break God's law, but God's law is simply  the way he built you. He built you to love, not to hate. He built you to be unselfish, not to be  selfish. He built you not to spend all your money on yourself. That's the reason why he says,  give it away.

He built you to forgive. That's why he says forgive. He built you to have sex inside. A covenant of marriage. That's why he says to do that.

None of this is busy work. This is not like  my eighth grade algebra teacher. You used to say, well, you know, kids got to be still off the street. So as you say, do all these things to keep you off the street. That's busy work.

There's no busy work  in the will of God. God comes and says, I built you this way. You will only flourish. If you break  this, you break yourself. If you trample on this, you're trampling on your own heart.

If you're  trampling on this, you're trampling on your own world. And every time you send you just turning the  flame up, turning up the burner, and you go to ashes faster, do you see that? Everywhere we look,  we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache. We feel it in the world around us and in our own  lives. How did it get this way?

And what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing  this month, what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer. Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer, Dr. Keller shows how the reality of sin  explains the pain we see all around us, and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing.

Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes or choices  or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world will help you see how the gospel speaks  to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us. This newly released book What  Is Wrong with the World is our thanks for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the  good news of Jesus.

Let me tell you what the positive part is. The positive part is the Messiah comes  to deal with all the results of sin. The Messiah comes not look at Messiah does not come only to  forgive your sins, give you peace in your in your little heart, and take you to heaven. The Messiah  does not come to earth and say, let me take you away from all this. He doesn't do that.

Instead,  he says I'm going to give you a joy and a power so we can rehab the world. I can give you a I'm going to bring you a joy and a power inside. I'm going to remake you inside  so we can remake the whole world together. My power, my spirit, my goal is not just simply to take  you into some other world of esoteric consciousness. Listen, every other religion says that.

Eastern and Western, what's the ideal? What's the ideal? Paradise or the all-soul or something like  that. That's never what Christianity or Judaism has ever talked about. It talks about the new  heavens.

It talks about the new earth. It means matter is good. Jesus didn't just die to save our souls. He also rose to save our bodies. What else is the resurrection for?

Therefore, when the Messiah comes, he's going to say, I have come back to make things whole. I've  come back to, first of all, turn off the fire and then to rebuild everything, restore everything,  say, reweave everything, make everything whole. That's what he's after. That's the only way  you can understand so many of the prophecies of Isaiah. That's the problem.

Now, how is God going  to do that? And the answer is here in this tremendous Messiah. Now, this Messiah, in verse 1,  again, I have to give you a little help. It doesn't hit you right away as an English reader so much. But anyway, this particular Messiah, right away, we're told the spirit of the sovereign  Lord is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach.

Now, before we go on any further,  the Lord has anointed me to preach. Now, this is what that's saying. If you really read all of  Isaiah, and you know, it's very hard, and I want to admit, I don't want anybody to go away feeling  guilty because it's too hard. It's very hard to read Isaiah. It's a long book.

But I didn't realize  until because of you, because I had to do this for you, I had to read the whole book. For the first  of my life, I realized that there is a narrative, and there's an enormous crisis coming up to chapter  61 when you read the book. Because in the early part of the book of Isaiah, we're told that there's  going to be this strong, incredible, Davidic king, someone who's going to raise a banner. In fact,  in Isaiah 11, verses 1 and 2, it says, this great king is going to come and he's going to raise a  banner and he's going to be glorious and he's going to summons the nation and he's going to put  down all evil and he's going to make the whole world right. And it says, the spirit of the Lord will  be upon him to do this.

And so this is a reference to Psalm 2, Isaiah 11. And that makes sense to us. They say, yes, the world is a mess. We need somebody to come in and deliver us. But then in the  middle part of Isaiah, starting in Isaiah 42, suddenly a new figure appears in these prophecies.

And this figure is utterly unlike the old, the anointed king of the earlier chapters. Utterly unlike the anointed king, this is what's called in the literature, the servant. And in  Isaiah 42, Isaiah 49, Isaiah 50, and Isaiah 53, we're going to go next week. A new figure arises. And we're told that he's not attractive.

He's totally unlike the anointed conqueror. The anointed conqueror is glorious and we all want him. This one we're told, Isaiah 53 has no  beauty. No beauty with which we should desire him. And we're told, of course, the great anointed  conqueror is going to go on to victory.

However, this figure is going to suffer. This figure is  utterly unstrong. What do we tell about this figure? We're told he had no beauty that we should  desire him, but we're also told as a lamb before her shearers is silent. So he opened not his mouth.

And he was led to slaughter. He's likened to a little lamb. He's likened to a female lamb. He's  likened to one of the most weak little creatures in the animal kingdom. And so this is a person  who's utterly different.

Then the first person, why is Isaiah doing this? What's going on? Who is this  person? But we're told in Isaiah 42, verse one, that this servant is the one who is anointed by  the spirit. And this is the reason why when you come to Isaiah chapter 61, first one, if you've  been reading it all along and especially been reading in Hebrew, which is what they originally did,  you suddenly, your jaw drops, hits the top of your chest.

You can't believe it because up to now,  you've either had somebody who's suffering and sweet and nice and sacrificing and ugly and  defeated, or you have this incredibly, you know, this conqueror, this strong one, this glorious  one, this beautiful one. And suddenly, we see that they're the same person. As Isaiah 61 says,  this is the same one because not only does he proclaim freedom to the captives, he binds up to broken  hearted. The warrior is a nurse. How could this be the same person?

But Isaiah says, this is my  breakthrough. This is my theological breakthrough. This is what the Lord has shown me. The victory will be a defeat. The strong one will be incredibly weak.

The salvation will happen  not by you, summonsing up your strength and obeying this great king. It will happen because  this great king will become incredibly weak and suffer and be defeated and die. Now,  somebody says, how could that be? Why would that be? I don't get it.

And here's the answer,  in verse three, three little words instead. Three little words instead. It says, I will provide for  those who grieve in Zion to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes that oil of gladness  instead of mourning and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. Now, that's not too  bad a translation. It kind of gets at it.

But basically, what we're told is that the Messiah is  not just simply saying, you've got your ashes. Let me put a crown of beauty on top of your ashes,  right? He's not saying, you've got your, you know, you have your, your mourning, but let me,  let me put oil on top of you. No, he's saying, I'll give you what I've got. You give me what you've  got.

What we have here is the principle of substitution. And all of a sudden, we realize why he's not  beautiful. Why isn't he beautiful? Because we got his beauty. He gets our ashes.

Why are we joyful? Because he got his joy. He gets our despair. This is the reason why on the cross,  he cries out, my God, my God, why has nothing for sake? I mean, that's despair.

We got his despair. Pardon me. He got our despair. You see that? This means he'd have to be so incredibly strong.

Don't you see? It's one thing if you are a lamb to face your shears and or to fit in at your  shears. It's one thing if you are a lamb to face the people who are about to kill you. You see, with a certain poise, it's another thing when you're not a lamb to become a lamb. It's one thing if you are ugly to live with it.

It's another thing if you're beautiful,  the voluntarily become ugly. Somebody else can be beautiful. Do you see what's going on here? Behold the beauty of his voluntary ugliness. Behold the strength of his voluntary weakness.

He had to be that strong. He had to be the first figure if he could in order to be the second figure. And of course, being the second figure, he wasn't something that he was something he had to do. He did it for us. And therefore, substitution.

Jesus Christ, when he comes to earth,  is able to deal with the fire of sin because he personally has to go through every aspect  of the devastation of sin. He is physically broken. That's the reason why he gets ashes. He is psychologically broken. That's why he gets mourning.

And he spiritually broken in that  the father cuts him off. He's like, God, my God, why I stop forsaking me so he gets the spirit of despair. Now, what does that mean for us practically? Let's get to that. Let's make a little list.

How should we respond? Number one, please trust him. Now, here's what I'm saying. The first thing is, look at verse 11, the soil is what grows the sapling. Do you see that?

If I take an acorn and I hold it in my hand, I can walk around for years and years and years. You know what's going to happen? Nothing. Why? Because it's the soil that gives the power of growth  to the acorn or at least opens up the power of growth in the acorn.

It's the soil. It's the nutrients. It's the moisture. If I just hold on to it, I just walk around all the time with it. Nothing.

And verse 11 says, as the soil  will finally turn us from ashes, you know, without the soil, eventually the acorn will go to ashes. If I just carry it around, eventually just fall apart. It has to be planted. So what we're being  told is the sovereignty of the Lord. That word sovereign Lord is pretty unusual.

Sovereign means  the kingliness of the king. That is the soil in which your soul can grow. Obedience to him. Now you see, if we only knew that he was the king of the first part of Isaiah and not the king of  the second part of Isaiah, I know you couldn't handle it, but a lot of us can't handle it anyway. Let me be real honest.

A lot of you say I would like something from God. I'm afraid to say I submit. I'm afraid to say I surrender. I'm just afraid. And I know why, because there's a part of your heart that says,  if I really, really say to God, anything you say, I will do, anything you send, I'll accept.

See, that's submitting. That's going under the soil. That's putting your soul under the  sovereignty of him. To say anything you tell me, no matter how I feel about it, I'll do. No matter what it looks like, practically, I'll do.

And then whatever you send me, I will accept. That's putting yourself underneath the soil. We're being told it's his kingship that your soul needs. You'll never grow until that happens. The fire will never start to be turned.

The burner won't be  turned down until that happens. And you know what, a lot of you are saying, I'm scared to do that. Of course, he might ask me to do something I don't want to do. Well, of course, Abraham didn't want to  take Isaac up the hill. Jesus didn't want to go to the cross.

I'm not saying he won't ask you  something you don't want to do. Of course, he's going to do that. But unless Jesus says, unless  the seed falls into the ground and dies, it cannot bear fruit. Ironically, the seed can either  die underground. And it becomes something great and beautiful.

It can die above ground, but it's  going to die one way or the other and you're going to die one way or the other. You can either be  your own master and your own Lord. And you'll go to ashes or you can die to your will. You can  die to leading your own life your own way. You want to go under?

I will do whatever you say. Whatever I see your will is I will do no matter what. Whatever you send me, I will accept. And verse 1 says, the sovereignty of the king. You can trust him.

Verse 11 says, the sovereignty  of the king. It will grow you, but the whole passage is saying, but this is the king who went under  for you. This is the king who lost everything for you. Think about what you, what might you give up? If you really say, I am going to give myself to Jesus Christ utterly.

Sure you're going to give  up some things. You think you're going to give up anything like what he gave up? He says, if you  give up these things, all you're going to give up is this, if you give up your rights, you'll  give up your despair. If you give up your rights, you'll give up your ashes. I took your ashes.

You're going to get nothing but beauty from me. I took your morning. You're going to get nothing  but co-adness from me. Don't you see? That's the first thing.

The warrior is a nurse. Go under. That's the first thing. Second thing. Very important.

Unless you see that he's  both the suffering servant and the great Lord, you can't become a Christian. You know why? You see, if you just think of him as this great Lord, I'm going to obey. I'm just going to obey. That's not what makes you a Christian.

What makes you a Christian is verse 10. This is Isaiah  beginning to speak. Isaiah actually gives us the prophecy. It's the Messiah who's speaking. Jesus Christ who's speaking.

But when you get down there to verse 8 and 9, suddenly you see, look  it. Suddenly Isaiah begins to speak. He begins to speak about this and here's what Isaiah says. He has robed me. In fact, I deviated from the NIV.

He has wrapped me in a robe of righteousness. What does it mean to become a Christian? It means to not say, I'm strong enough and I can follow the  king. I'll obey. Then I'll get his blessing.

Oh no, no. We have to see it. He's stronger than that. He's stronger than that. We do not just have a king who comes to this follow me.

We have a king who  first comes and says, I'm going to die. I'm going to be everything you need to be. I'm going to  substitute for you. So I don't ask you to achieve a righteousness. I'm going to give you a righteousness.

I'm going to plant it in your heart. I'm going to wrap it around your body and your soul. You're going to get my righteousness, my gladness, see? My beauty. That's what you're going to get.

And so you're not a Christian, if you say, I'm going to try from now on to really live a good life. That's not really dying, by the way. You may think, oh, I'm no longer my own Lord,  but you're your own Savior. And if you're your own Savior, you are your own Lord. You have to  willing to say, I give up my rights to my own life because you have done everything for me except  me.

Oh, Father, for what Jesus has done. That'll make you a Christian. You've got to put the two  together or you can't become a Christian. Thirdly, Christian friends, until you see that he's both the  conquering hero, conquering the anointed conqueror and the suffering servant. You're not going to  understand actually even the way he deals with you in your own life.

Here's one thing that I know. Sometimes I do something very stupid and God just gets me off the hook. He just, you know, I say,  I did something very stupid. Please help me. And somehow he shields me.

He lets it go, okay, right? So sometimes it's just something really stupid and everything's fine. And other times I do just  the tiniest little sort of stupid thing. And wham, wham, wham, wham. You say,  hit me again, Lord.

I'm still breathing. Why would that be? I never forget when I listen to a  tape by Dick Lucas on John 11 where Jesus comes to the tomb of Lazarus and two sisters come out  to him. Do you remember this? Martha comes and says, if you had been here, my brother Lazarus  wouldn't have died.

Okay. And like three verses later, Mary comes to him, the other sister  and says, if my brother, if you had been here, my brother Lazarus wouldn't have died. If you look  carefully, it's the same words. It's the same spot. It's the same circumstance.

It's the same  condition. My goodness. It's the women who their names both start with MA. I mean, everything's the  same. And in the first case, what does Jesus do?

He says to Martha, Martha, I am the resurrection  in the life. It's really in the face. I know when we read it, we hear, I am the resurrection in the  life. He who, you know, yeah, but look at the context. He's sort of, he's, he's getting Martha  like this.

He's really saying, Martha, I am the resurrection in the life. If I had been here,  when I'm here, you live. It doesn't matter when. He said, I am the resurrection in the life. So  he's kind of confronting her.

But when Mary comes up, says the same question, makes the same statement,  excuse me, comes after him in the same way. What does he do? Do you remember? He just weeps. See, the first time he gives the ministry of truth and the second time he gives the ministry of  tears, one time he just kind of wham and the other time he just listens.

Now, you know why? Because the warrior is a nurse. He is the wonderful counselor. You and I, any, every, some of your  counselors, aren't you? You're not perfect.

I know. I've tried so hard to be a perfect counselor. And here's the problem. Sometimes where I really need to just listen and patient and hold their  hand and instead I confront them, doesn't go right. They really need to be listened to.

And other times  I listen and listen and listen and listen and I should have confronted them. I mean, I tend to confront  when I should be listening. I listen when I should confront. Sometimes I do the ministry of truth  when it should be just the ministry of tears. Other times I do the ministry of tears when I really  should be doing a ministry of truth.

But Jesus is always spot on. And that's the only reason why  he seems like a schizophrenic to you. Because he knows exactly what you need when you need it. And there's times in which for some reason he just comes in and he sort of lifts the ship and takes  you right on through. And other times he just, other times he seems to completely abandon you.

Why? He's the perfect counselor. He's the warrior and a nurse. He'll change your bedpan. He'll punch you in the chops.

See, nurses very often can't do that or they don't want to do that. They're not that kind of person. And wires, obviously, also can't change bedpounds. They're not  kind of that kind of person. But our savior is the wonderful counselor.

See, the wonderful counselor,  mighty God, everlasting father, Prince of Peace, the whole thing. Fourth. When Jesus Christ preached this text, he says, listen, he gets to the middle of the verse  and he says, the year of the Lord's favor. In other words, when Jesus Christ preached this, he got up  and he says, the spirit of the Lord is upon me, right? Because the Lord has anointed me to preach  good news of the poor.

He has sent me to bind the broken hearted to proclaim freedom for the  captives and release from the darkness for the prisoners to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor. And he stopped right in the middle of the sentence, right in the middle of the verse. And he sat  down and he says today, it begins. Well, why didn't he go on to this less part of this passage here? Why in the world didn't he come on and say, and the day of the Lord's vengeance?

What's a matter with  Jesus? And here's the answer. It's pretty clear that they're not the same thing. There's a day of vengeance coming. There's a day of judgment coming.

But it's pretty intriguing  that Isaiah, the Messiah here in Isaiah says, I've come to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor  and the day of vengeance. That means there's a period of time that's called the Jubilee. But eventually it'll be over and it'll be a day of judgment. And this is really simply what  Jesus is saying. Jesus is saying, not seize the day.

Jesus saying the Christians seize the year. Now what's that mean? It means from now, my first coming to my second coming, I want you to live  on the principles of the Jubilee. From what we can tell, when Jesus Christ preached this in the very  first time, and he literally said, I've come to declare the Jubilee, there is no indication  that he tried to set up a social program in Israel. He didn't say, look, we've got to go back  and everybody's got to get their old land, but he didn't do that.

On the other hand,  he didn't do that. On the other hand, it is silly to think that he is really talking about  his only spiritually. That is not what the text, that's not what Leviticus 25 is like. And here's  my best answer. A New Testament scholar named NT Wright has a really good passage on this in one  of his books.

And he says, Jesus Christ is calling Christians between the first and second coming of  Christ to live themselves on the Jubilee principle. That means Jesus is coming and saying,  my kingdom of God, my kingdom is here partially but not fully. And I want you to begin to sacrifice. I want you to be radically generous with each other. I want you to forgive each other to your debts.

I want you to create a community in which people really lay themselves out for the poor. I want you, a community in which you really lay yourself out for the brokenhearted. I want you to say because of what you've done for me, I am now going to be working  to bind up people in every way. I'm going to try to bring them to Christ spiritually. I'm going to try  to bring them together and bind up themselves psychologically.

I'm going to try to bring them up  socially and economically. If they're poor, I'm going to do everything I can. Does that mean I'm  going to have to be spending money? I'm going to be giving a lot of my money away. Does it mean I'm  going to be involved in people's lives?

Yes. Jesus is not saying Christians get into power and  make the Jubilee the program. But that hasn't worked. That's not the point. It doesn't mean that  Christians shouldn't be working for justice in society in general.

Yes. But what he is saying is  let's not get out from under this. Christians now redeemer. You right now begin to live on the  principles of the Jubilee. That means forgive each other spiritually and also means be unbelievably  generous with each other in every way.

Bring each other into each other's homes.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today's message, Tim Keller explores the human condition through stories in the Bible,  uncovering what Scripture says about sin and why it's the only explanation deep enough  to face the truth about ourselves. We go to the next couple of weeks, four weeks actually. We're going to be looking at what  Isaiah tells us about what's wrong with us. Isaiah has some pretty fascinating things to  say because the longest, in some ways, the greatest Old Testament prophet. And what  we have here is one of the great prophecies about the Messiah and what the Messiah will  do.

Isaiah 61, 1 to 11. The Spirit of the sovereign Lord is on me because the Lord has  anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the broken hearted  to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners, to proclaim  the year of the Lord's favor and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all who mourn,  and provide for those who grieve in Zion, to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead  of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit  of despair. They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the Lord for the display of  His splendor. They will rebuild the ancient ruins and restore the places long devastated.

They will renew the ruined cities that have been devastated for generations. Aliens will  shepherd your flocks, foreigners will work your fields and vineyards, and you will be  called priests of the Lord. You will be named ministers of your God. You will feed on  the wealth of nations and in their riches you will boast. Instead of their shame, my  people will receive a double portion.

Instead of disgrace, they will rejoice in their inheritance. And so they will inherit a double portion in their land, and everlasting joy will be theirs. For I, the Lord, love justice. I hate robbery and iniquity. In my faithfulness, I will reward  them and make an everlasting covenant with them.

Their descendants will be known among the nations,  and they are offspring among the peoples. All who see them will acknowledge that they are a  people. The Lord has blessed. I delight greatly in the Lord. My soul rejoices in my God,  for he has clothed me with garments of salvation, and unwrapped me in a robe of righteousness.

As a bridegroom adorns his head like a priest, and as a bride adorns yourself with  her jewels. For as the soil makes the sprout come up, and a garden causes seeds to grow,  so the sovereign Lord will make righteousness and praise spring up before all nations. This is God's word. Now, because this is the third in the series, we need to take some stock  what we're doing, why we're doing it, where we've come. We're talking about sin,  doing a series on sin.

Why? Well, because early in the century, maybe late 19th century,  early 20th century, this isn't, we can't be completely, you can't pinpoint this exactly,  basically our Western society told us to get rid of the concept of sin. To get rid of it. And there was some pretty good reasons for it. I mean, because of the abuses, they said,  when you use the word sin and evil, when you use sin with regard to yourself, when you look at  yourself and call yourself a sinner, you just crush yourself.

Just make yourself feel guilty,  you make yourself feel terrible and worthless, see? Feel ashamed. And when you call other people's  sinners, when you put sin on them, you do the same thing, you not only crush them and make them  feel shame, but it probably might lead you to abuse them. They're sinners, so you can just treat  them in all sorts of ways. So sin was considered a dangerous and unhelpful category.

And the reason  at the time, there was some at least logical reason to get rid of it, was because at the very same  time, many, many people in Europe and America were saying this, they were saying, well, you know,  the troubles and the difficulties of our country and of our society, the reason people are filled with  what the reason of for violence and for oppression and for selfishness is really because of unjust  social conditions, because of bad education, because of bad environment. And through political  and social transformations and the procedure, the progress of science, we can deal with these  things. It's a much better way of putting it. And of course, it does not do so much more optimistic,  but we got a problem now. At the end of the 20th century, we've been through the Holocaust,  we've been through two world wars, and a couple years ago, a book that's really had a big impact on me,  Andrew Del Bonco, right up here at Columbia University wrote a book called The Death of Satan,  fascinating book.

And he says something here, I'll read it to you. He says, a gulf has opened now  in our culture between the visibility of evil and the intellectual resources available for coping  with it. And then he puts it perfectly. We now have an inescapable problem. We feel something that  our culture no longer gives us the vocabulary to express.

Now, it's pretty simple. Look, Marxism,  at least said, I know it's, we know it's wrong. You know, they had a theory what's wrong, why  the why why we're so messed up. And of course, Marxism has done as a movement. Freudianism had a  theory about what's wrong with us, but it's over with a movement, you see?

The optimistic idea that  if we just educate people and we do this and that, we can deal with, you know, pressure and racism  and violence and so forth, that's over. It's gone. And Del Bonco says, but here's the weird thing. We got rid of vocabulary. We got rid of the concept of sin.

And now we see it in front of us  when we can't talk about it. We can't deal with it. We feel ourselves in the presence of something  that we no longer have the vocabulary to deal with. It's terrible. In fact, next week,  a couple weeks or now, come back and give you some examples that Del Bonco gives.

I can't do that  tonight. But today, but here's the point. We have got to go back to the Bible to get the vocabulary. And here's my proposition to you. The reason that the Bible's vocabulary concept of sin was  jettison was partly because it wasn't very well understood.

The average person, if I ask you,  what's sin? You know, our memories of society about what the Bible says about sin is pretty simple. Sin is breaking God's law. And that makes us guilty. And that's true.

And actually,  I've got a sermon coming on that. But I want you to say that if you start with that,  you really don't understand that multidimensional, profound, nuancedness of the  biblical doctrine of sin. We started last week and we said, okay, first of all, sin is the first  thing is that sin is breaking God's scale. It is reducing God and that creates smallness of  spirit. It's refusing to treat him as glorious, remember?

Then last week, we said, sin is not  just breaking God's scale, it's breaking God's heart. Breaking God's scale and treating him is  something less glorious than he is, making him too small, leads to strunginess of spirit. But  when you replace God, when you break his heart and you reject his love, then what you're actually  doing is you create addiction, remember that. So sin is smallness of spirit, sin is addiction. Now, this week we're going to go, oh, still, before we get to the idea of breaking God's law,  we have to understand it's breaking God's scale.

That means it's treating him as less glorious  than he is. Otherwise, you don't understand sin. It's breaking God's heart. He says, I want to be  the lover of your soul and we put ourselves in the arms of other lovers and as a result, we're  addicts. This week, we're going to look at one more before we get anywhere else and that is sin  is not just breaking God's scale, breaking God's heart.

It's also breaking God's design for us. You do not understand sin at all unless you think, unless you understand that sin is breaking God's  design. See, God's law is not just an expression of his heart, so to break God's law, you're  trampling on his heart. God's law is also, it's your design print of your heart. It's the way  you're built to work.

And when you break God's law, you break yourself. You're trampling on yourself. Let's get into this. This passage actually is telling us about that because it's telling us what  the Messiah is going to do. And the first thing it shows us is the Messiah is going to deal with the  problems of life and that shows us something about sin.

So here's how we're going to break this down. We're going to see what the problem is, what God is going to do about it and how we should respond. What the problem is, what we should do about it, what God's going to do about it, how we should  respond. First of all, what is the problem? Right away, we have to see this is remarkable.

All the  things this Messiah does and the thing that first hits you is the range of them. First of all,  take a look here. First of all, he deals with both body and soul. For example, he comes to the poor. Collar read from Matthew 11, Jesus was very big on this passage.

I'll tell you how big he was. The first sermon he ever preached, he chose this text. Now, when you're going to start a campaign,  you're really careful what you say that first time, isn't it? Because you want to make sure it's  perfect. It perfectly conveys what you're trying to, what you're all about.

When Jesus Christ  preaches very first sermon and look for, he preached on this text, Isaiah 61, 1 and 2. The first thing it comes up, preaches the poor. That has to do with, he's dealing with economic  brokenness. But then secondly, look at, he binds up the broken hearted. He's dealing with emotional  brokenness.

Then it says, look, he's released from darkness. He releases from darkness. Now, you have to be careful because it says, proclaim freedom for the captors and release from  darkness. And those are two different things. It's not repetitious.

And he's talking about  intellectual blindness. He's talking about spiritual blindness, not seeing the truth. But then lastly, and this is, this is what it takes just a moment to massage, all right? He says, he has been sent, he has sent me to bind up the broken hearted to proclaim freedom for  the captors and then down to the second verse to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor. Now, this  is not something you're going to get by reading it in English.

What he's doing here, this person who  comes and says, the Spirit of the Lord is upon me to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord,  the year of the Lord's favor, proclaim liberty. He is quoting Leviticus 25. And Leviticus 25 is  talking about the Jubilee. And this Messianic figure is coming to say, I have come to bring  the Jubilee. What's that?

Well, let me tell you, you've heard the Sabbath. You've heard that in  the Old Testament God said to the people, one day in seven Sabbath rest. But maybe you haven't  heard that he also said to the people, one year in seven must be a Sabbath year. He didn't just  institute the Sabbath day. He also instituted a Sabbath year.

And a Sabbath year was this. In those days, when someone through poor crops, poor misfortune or poor judgment, would come to  the place where you get so in debt you couldn't pay your debts off. What would happen is you would  become an indentured servant to the people that you owed. And you would become their servant. And of course, that's the sort of thing that happened.

Some people got more prosperous. Some people  didn't get as prosperous. But every seventh year, God says Sabbath. What a Sabbath? In the Sabbath  year, all debts were forgiven.

All servants went free, therefore. And the land was the life  fallow which meant in order to build up its nutrients, the people were to eat out of the storehouses  and not till the field. So everybody rested. And the land rested. And you forgave your brother from  the heart, their debts.

And you forgave your brother from the heart, any wrongs that you had done. That's the Sabbath year. But then on top of that, that was in the Old Testament. You can read about  in Deuteronomy and Leviticus. But in Leviticus 25, we have one of the weirder parts of the Old  Testament.

It's weird because it's so radical. And from what we can tell, it was never practiced. And it's always the possibility that wasn't supposed to be. But here's what would happen. You said  every seven days is a Sabbath day and every seven years is a Sabbath year.

But every Sabbath Sabbath. In other words, every seven Sabbath years, which would mean the 50th year, the Jubilee year,  every seven seven of years, there was to be a Jubilee. And the Jubilee was even more extensive. Not  only were all the debts forgiven, not only were all the servants and the slaves freed. But if you lost your land any time in that 49 years, bad crops, bad judgment, if you had lost your land,  your family's original land, it came back to you.

And the whole purpose behind the Sabbath year,  and the Jubilee, was how do you make sure that if you blow it, you get a running start,  a second chance economically. How do you make sure that you don't have long-term families  getting down to the culture of poverty, learning habits that have to do with poverty, other people  getting into the culture of wealth and having those kinds of habits. How do you do that? Well,  that's how it was supposed to be done. Now, one of the things that's pretty interesting about this  is it clearly goes that the Jubilee was an institution that was not only for spiritual rest.

It wasn't only the place where you were saying, I'm going to forgive you, and God has forgiven me. But it was also economically. I was forgiving you, and I'm going to give you so that you can come  up out of the place economically where you are. It's astounding. And it really was pretty remarkable.

And as far as we know, Israel never observed it. Can you imagine? And the Messiah shows up and says, I bring the Jubilee. And he not only shows that this means body and soul are going to be put together. But if you look carefully, it also shows that he comes to not only deal with body and soul  problems, but also individual and corporate problems, because look at verse three and verse four.

In verse three, we see complete individual transformation. I will bring you a crown of beauty. We'll get back to that. Oil of gladness, garments of praise, and you will become oaks of righteousness. That's what it.

That's not just symbolic. Oaks of righteousness means organic righteousness. God is not just going  to declare you righteous, which he does when he wraps you in the robe of righteousness in verse 10. But he's going to make you actually righteous. He's going to put his spirit in you.

He's going to put his nature in you. And that's what you have in verse three. You're going to become inside out, completely transformed. But then in verse four, we see  that they're supposed to go and rebuild cities. And if you look at verse four and five,  it doesn't just say, oh, you know, forget the cities.

You know, let's put up a new subdivision. You go back and you rebuild the cities. And if you look carefully, in that city, there's going to be  racial harmony. It says, it says aliens are going to be working with you. You have to be  a little careful because the English doesn't bring it out.

It says, for example, when it says the  aliens are going to shepherd your flocks, that word for shepherd doesn't just mean you. They're  going to be your hired hands. But that means that they're going to stand with you and they're going  to take responsibility with you. There's a racial harmony. There's a rebuilding of cities.

There's personal transformation. There's social transformation. There's spiritual wholeness. There's psychological wholeness. There's economic wholeness.

There's racial wholeness. The whole nine yards. And the Messiah comes back and says, that's what I'm about to do. Now,  what does that tell us about sin? That's the first point.

And here's what it tells us about sin. The wages of sin is ashes. You notice in verse three, it says, I will put a crown of beauty on  where you have ashes. And he's thinking very literally, when somebody died or when anything went  really wrong in your life, you didn't just put on black. What you did was you put ashes.

You  went into the fireplace and you picked up ashes and you put them on your forehead. And not just a  little cute little cross, you say that you put even today at Lent in many churches where you  put the ashes on there for good for Ash Wednesday. No, you poured it on your head. Think about it. You looked ugly.

You were totally dirty. And here's what you were saying. Life is like this. The Bible, what are ashes? You put something in the fire.

And the fire knocks it apart. There's chemicals that were coherent. You put a wooden fire and there was a cohesion. There was a coherence. It was integrated.

There was all these various sorts of chemicals and various  things that turned it into wood. But what does the fire do? The fire destroys that which keeps those  things that should be together. It destroys the coherence and it goes to ashes. If you put your  hand in the fire, it'll go to ashes.

If you put your paper in the fire, it'll go to ashes. But you see, when the Messiah says, I'm going to give you beauty for ashes. He's actually referring  to everything he's been looking at in a whole survey. Because essentially life is like that. My favorite illustration is, there's a couple of ways to put it.

Think of a chicken in your oven. You bring the chicken out. You put it on the table. Too hot to eat. So you wait for 15 minutes.

And you're happy. Why? Because now I can eat it. But the only reason you can eat it is because it's  losing energy. Because that's how life is.

Leave it for three hours. Then you won't want to eat it. It loses energy until it's kind of yucky. Leave it for three days. And now it's a help hazard.

Leave it for three weeks. But when you watch it, go to pieces. Oh, of course, if you could burn it  up, you see, in the fire, it goes to ashes very quickly. But don't you see? If you just let it be,  it's going to ashes anyway.

And as you watch the chicken go to ashes, why? Because that's the way  existence is. You're looking in a mirror. You're going to ashes. If you put yourself into the fire,  you'll go to ashes very quickly.

But if it doesn't matter, die at all you want. Go to the doctor  all you want, okay? Exercise all you want to keep yourself together, to keep yourself whole,  to keep yourself tight, but you're spreading. And you will continue to spread until finally,  you are ashes. You are dust, dust thou art, ashes thou art.

Now what are we talking about here? The Bible says that the whole world is burning in a flame of sin. That when I want to be my own master,  when I want to be my own Lord, when I want to be my own Savior, what I'm just doing essentially  is I put fire, sin is fire against the design that God has for the way He wants things to be,  which is peace, flourishing, growth, shalom, which is the Hebrew word for peace, but it means  every kind of human flourishing. Now you can get this down into the micro. Can I get it out of  the micro?

Somebody treats you bad. And you say, I'm not going to forgive. I will not forgive. And some of you are in this situation right now, right now. The Bible says God says, I forgive,  therefore you must forgive you must forgive.

That's the word of God. If you don't forgive,  that's a sin. Now let's think about this for a second. All right. If you sin, what are the  consequences of sin?

Well, a lot of people say, I'm just scared, you know, maybe God won't answer my  prayer if I keep my sin in my heart. Maybe that's that. Well, it does say that. Okay. So maybe you  think of sin like this.

I better not sin because God's sort of watching me. And as long as I stay  sinful, you know, God's going to get me. He's going to watch me say, boy, that person's sinning,  what can I do to make their life miserable today? But boy, you misunderstand. You misunderstand.

When you hold that grudge, the doctor will tell you that that's that is actually turning up the flame  on your heart. You're much more likely to have heart problems. You're much more likely to  stomach problems. You're much more likely to have physical problems because you're mad. But not only  that, of course, you start to break down psychologically.

You'll be in denial. It'll control you. But, of course, it breaks you down spiritually. Sin disintegrates us. Sin makes us break down.

Sin puts, sin is an invisible flame. It's visible to God. Oh God sees it. God looks down and he sees  us all on fire. He sees us all fall into part.

Why? Because what we're doing is we're going against  our design. Whenever you want to be your own savior, your own master, it's not like oh gosh, you  know, here I did what I shouldn't have done today. I wonder where the God's going to get me. Sin is guilty, but sin is, first of all, stupid.

Sin does break God's law, but God's law is simply  the way he built you. He built you to love, not to hate. He built you to be unselfish, not to be  selfish. He built you not to spend all your money on yourself. That's the reason why he says,  give it away.

He built you to forgive. That's why he says forgive. He built you to have sex inside. A covenant of marriage. That's why he says to do that.

None of this is busy work. This is not like  my eighth grade algebra teacher. You used to say, well, you know, kids got to be still off the street. So as you say, do all these things to keep you off the street. That's busy work.

There's no busy work  in the will of God. God comes and says, I built you this way. You will only flourish. If you break  this, you break yourself. If you trample on this, you're trampling on your own heart.

If you're  trampling on this, you're trampling on your own world. And every time you send you just turning the  flame up, turning up the burner, and you go to ashes faster, do you see that? Everywhere we look,  we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache. We feel it in the world around us and in our own  lives. How did it get this way?

And what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing  this month, what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer. Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer, Dr. Keller shows how the reality of sin  explains the pain we see all around us, and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing.

Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes or choices  or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world will help you see how the gospel speaks  to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us. This newly released book What  Is Wrong with the World is our thanks for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the  good news of Jesus.

Let me tell you what the positive part is. The positive part is the Messiah comes  to deal with all the results of sin. The Messiah comes not look at Messiah does not come only to  forgive your sins, give you peace in your in your little heart, and take you to heaven. The Messiah  does not come to earth and say, let me take you away from all this. He doesn't do that.

Instead,  he says I'm going to give you a joy and a power so we can rehab the world. I can give you a I'm going to bring you a joy and a power inside. I'm going to remake you inside  so we can remake the whole world together. My power, my spirit, my goal is not just simply to take  you into some other world of esoteric consciousness. Listen, every other religion says that.

Eastern and Western, what's the ideal? What's the ideal? Paradise or the all-soul or something like  that. That's never what Christianity or Judaism has ever talked about. It talks about the new  heavens.

It talks about the new earth. It means matter is good. Jesus didn't just die to save our souls. He also rose to save our bodies. What else is the resurrection for?

Therefore, when the Messiah comes, he's going to say, I have come back to make things whole. I've  come back to, first of all, turn off the fire and then to rebuild everything, restore everything,  say, reweave everything, make everything whole. That's what he's after. That's the only way  you can understand so many of the prophecies of Isaiah. That's the problem.

Now, how is God going  to do that? And the answer is here in this tremendous Messiah. Now, this Messiah, in verse 1,  again, I have to give you a little help. It doesn't hit you right away as an English reader so much. But anyway, this particular Messiah, right away, we're told the spirit of the sovereign  Lord is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach.

Now, before we go on any further,  the Lord has anointed me to preach. Now, this is what that's saying. If you really read all of  Isaiah, and you know, it's very hard, and I want to admit, I don't want anybody to go away feeling  guilty because it's too hard. It's very hard to read Isaiah. It's a long book.

But I didn't realize  until because of you, because I had to do this for you, I had to read the whole book. For the first  of my life, I realized that there is a narrative, and there's an enormous crisis coming up to chapter  61 when you read the book. Because in the early part of the book of Isaiah, we're told that there's  going to be this strong, incredible, Davidic king, someone who's going to raise a banner. In fact,  in Isaiah 11, verses 1 and 2, it says, this great king is going to come and he's going to raise a  banner and he's going to be glorious and he's going to summons the nation and he's going to put  down all evil and he's going to make the whole world right. And it says, the spirit of the Lord will  be upon him to do this.

And so this is a reference to Psalm 2, Isaiah 11. And that makes sense to us. They say, yes, the world is a mess. We need somebody to come in and deliver us. But then in the  middle part of Isaiah, starting in Isaiah 42, suddenly a new figure appears in these prophecies.

And this figure is utterly unlike the old, the anointed king of the earlier chapters. Utterly unlike the anointed king, this is what's called in the literature, the servant. And in  Isaiah 42, Isaiah 49, Isaiah 50, and Isaiah 53, we're going to go next week. A new figure arises. And we're told that he's not attractive.

He's totally unlike the anointed conqueror. The anointed conqueror is glorious and we all want him. This one we're told, Isaiah 53 has no  beauty. No beauty with which we should desire him. And we're told, of course, the great anointed  conqueror is going to go on to victory.

However, this figure is going to suffer. This figure is  utterly unstrong. What do we tell about this figure? We're told he had no beauty that we should  desire him, but we're also told as a lamb before her shearers is silent. So he opened not his mouth.

And he was led to slaughter. He's likened to a little lamb. He's likened to a female lamb. He's  likened to one of the most weak little creatures in the animal kingdom. And so this is a person  who's utterly different.

Then the first person, why is Isaiah doing this? What's going on? Who is this  person? But we're told in Isaiah 42, verse one, that this servant is the one who is anointed by  the spirit. And this is the reason why when you come to Isaiah chapter 61, first one, if you've  been reading it all along and especially been reading in Hebrew, which is what they originally did,  you suddenly, your jaw drops, hits the top of your chest.

You can't believe it because up to now,  you've either had somebody who's suffering and sweet and nice and sacrificing and ugly and  defeated, or you have this incredibly, you know, this conqueror, this strong one, this glorious  one, this beautiful one. And suddenly, we see that they're the same person. As Isaiah 61 says,  this is the same one because not only does he proclaim freedom to the captives, he binds up to broken  hearted. The warrior is a nurse. How could this be the same person?

But Isaiah says, this is my  breakthrough. This is my theological breakthrough. This is what the Lord has shown me. The victory will be a defeat. The strong one will be incredibly weak.

The salvation will happen  not by you, summonsing up your strength and obeying this great king. It will happen because  this great king will become incredibly weak and suffer and be defeated and die. Now,  somebody says, how could that be? Why would that be? I don't get it.

And here's the answer,  in verse three, three little words instead. Three little words instead. It says, I will provide for  those who grieve in Zion to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes that oil of gladness  instead of mourning and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. Now, that's not too  bad a translation. It kind of gets at it.

But basically, what we're told is that the Messiah is  not just simply saying, you've got your ashes. Let me put a crown of beauty on top of your ashes,  right? He's not saying, you've got your, you know, you have your, your mourning, but let me,  let me put oil on top of you. No, he's saying, I'll give you what I've got. You give me what you've  got.

What we have here is the principle of substitution. And all of a sudden, we realize why he's not  beautiful. Why isn't he beautiful? Because we got his beauty. He gets our ashes.

Why are we joyful? Because he got his joy. He gets our despair. This is the reason why on the cross,  he cries out, my God, my God, why has nothing for sake? I mean, that's despair.

We got his despair. Pardon me. He got our despair. You see that? This means he'd have to be so incredibly strong.

Don't you see? It's one thing if you are a lamb to face your shears and or to fit in at your  shears. It's one thing if you are a lamb to face the people who are about to kill you. You see, with a certain poise, it's another thing when you're not a lamb to become a lamb. It's one thing if you are ugly to live with it.

It's another thing if you're beautiful,  the voluntarily become ugly. Somebody else can be beautiful. Do you see what's going on here? Behold the beauty of his voluntary ugliness. Behold the strength of his voluntary weakness.

He had to be that strong. He had to be the first figure if he could in order to be the second figure. And of course, being the second figure, he wasn't something that he was something he had to do. He did it for us. And therefore, substitution.

Jesus Christ, when he comes to earth,  is able to deal with the fire of sin because he personally has to go through every aspect  of the devastation of sin. He is physically broken. That's the reason why he gets ashes. He is psychologically broken. That's why he gets mourning.

And he spiritually broken in that  the father cuts him off. He's like, God, my God, why I stop forsaking me so he gets the spirit of despair. Now, what does that mean for us practically? Let's get to that. Let's make a little list.

How should we respond? Number one, please trust him. Now, here's what I'm saying. The first thing is, look at verse 11, the soil is what grows the sapling. Do you see that?

If I take an acorn and I hold it in my hand, I can walk around for years and years and years. You know what's going to happen? Nothing. Why? Because it's the soil that gives the power of growth  to the acorn or at least opens up the power of growth in the acorn.

It's the soil. It's the nutrients. It's the moisture. If I just hold on to it, I just walk around all the time with it. Nothing.

And verse 11 says, as the soil  will finally turn us from ashes, you know, without the soil, eventually the acorn will go to ashes. If I just carry it around, eventually just fall apart. It has to be planted. So what we're being  told is the sovereignty of the Lord. That word sovereign Lord is pretty unusual.

Sovereign means  the kingliness of the king. That is the soil in which your soul can grow. Obedience to him. Now you see, if we only knew that he was the king of the first part of Isaiah and not the king of  the second part of Isaiah, I know you couldn't handle it, but a lot of us can't handle it anyway. Let me be real honest.

A lot of you say I would like something from God. I'm afraid to say I submit. I'm afraid to say I surrender. I'm just afraid. And I know why, because there's a part of your heart that says,  if I really, really say to God, anything you say, I will do, anything you send, I'll accept.

See, that's submitting. That's going under the soil. That's putting your soul under the  sovereignty of him. To say anything you tell me, no matter how I feel about it, I'll do. No matter what it looks like, practically, I'll do.

And then whatever you send me, I will accept. That's putting yourself underneath the soil. We're being told it's his kingship that your soul needs. You'll never grow until that happens. The fire will never start to be turned.

The burner won't be  turned down until that happens. And you know what, a lot of you are saying, I'm scared to do that. Of course, he might ask me to do something I don't want to do. Well, of course, Abraham didn't want to  take Isaac up the hill. Jesus didn't want to go to the cross.

I'm not saying he won't ask you  something you don't want to do. Of course, he's going to do that. But unless Jesus says, unless  the seed falls into the ground and dies, it cannot bear fruit. Ironically, the seed can either  die underground. And it becomes something great and beautiful.

It can die above ground, but it's  going to die one way or the other and you're going to die one way or the other. You can either be  your own master and your own Lord. And you'll go to ashes or you can die to your will. You can  die to leading your own life your own way. You want to go under?

I will do whatever you say. Whatever I see your will is I will do no matter what. Whatever you send me, I will accept. And verse 1 says, the sovereignty of the king. You can trust him.

Verse 11 says, the sovereignty  of the king. It will grow you, but the whole passage is saying, but this is the king who went under  for you. This is the king who lost everything for you. Think about what you, what might you give up? If you really say, I am going to give myself to Jesus Christ utterly.

Sure you're going to give  up some things. You think you're going to give up anything like what he gave up? He says, if you  give up these things, all you're going to give up is this, if you give up your rights, you'll  give up your despair. If you give up your rights, you'll give up your ashes. I took your ashes.

You're going to get nothing but beauty from me. I took your morning. You're going to get nothing  but co-adness from me. Don't you see? That's the first thing.

The warrior is a nurse. Go under. That's the first thing. Second thing. Very important.

Unless you see that he's  both the suffering servant and the great Lord, you can't become a Christian. You know why? You see, if you just think of him as this great Lord, I'm going to obey. I'm just going to obey. That's not what makes you a Christian.

What makes you a Christian is verse 10. This is Isaiah  beginning to speak. Isaiah actually gives us the prophecy. It's the Messiah who's speaking. Jesus Christ who's speaking.

But when you get down there to verse 8 and 9, suddenly you see, look  it. Suddenly Isaiah begins to speak. He begins to speak about this and here's what Isaiah says. He has robed me. In fact, I deviated from the NIV.

He has wrapped me in a robe of righteousness. What does it mean to become a Christian? It means to not say, I'm strong enough and I can follow the  king. I'll obey. Then I'll get his blessing.

Oh no, no. We have to see it. He's stronger than that. He's stronger than that. We do not just have a king who comes to this follow me.

We have a king who  first comes and says, I'm going to die. I'm going to be everything you need to be. I'm going to  substitute for you. So I don't ask you to achieve a righteousness. I'm going to give you a righteousness.

I'm going to plant it in your heart. I'm going to wrap it around your body and your soul. You're going to get my righteousness, my gladness, see? My beauty. That's what you're going to get.

And so you're not a Christian, if you say, I'm going to try from now on to really live a good life. That's not really dying, by the way. You may think, oh, I'm no longer my own Lord,  but you're your own Savior. And if you're your own Savior, you are your own Lord. You have to  willing to say, I give up my rights to my own life because you have done everything for me except  me.

Oh, Father, for what Jesus has done. That'll make you a Christian. You've got to put the two  together or you can't become a Christian. Thirdly, Christian friends, until you see that he's both the  conquering hero, conquering the anointed conqueror and the suffering servant. You're not going to  understand actually even the way he deals with you in your own life.

Here's one thing that I know. Sometimes I do something very stupid and God just gets me off the hook. He just, you know, I say,  I did something very stupid. Please help me. And somehow he shields me.

He lets it go, okay, right? So sometimes it's just something really stupid and everything's fine. And other times I do just  the tiniest little sort of stupid thing. And wham, wham, wham, wham. You say,  hit me again, Lord.

I'm still breathing. Why would that be? I never forget when I listen to a  tape by Dick Lucas on John 11 where Jesus comes to the tomb of Lazarus and two sisters come out  to him. Do you remember this? Martha comes and says, if you had been here, my brother Lazarus  wouldn't have died.

Okay. And like three verses later, Mary comes to him, the other sister  and says, if my brother, if you had been here, my brother Lazarus wouldn't have died. If you look  carefully, it's the same words. It's the same spot. It's the same circumstance.

It's the same  condition. My goodness. It's the women who their names both start with MA. I mean, everything's the  same. And in the first case, what does Jesus do?

He says to Martha, Martha, I am the resurrection  in the life. It's really in the face. I know when we read it, we hear, I am the resurrection in the  life. He who, you know, yeah, but look at the context. He's sort of, he's, he's getting Martha  like this.

He's really saying, Martha, I am the resurrection in the life. If I had been here,  when I'm here, you live. It doesn't matter when. He said, I am the resurrection in the life. So  he's kind of confronting her.

But when Mary comes up, says the same question, makes the same statement,  excuse me, comes after him in the same way. What does he do? Do you remember? He just weeps. See, the first time he gives the ministry of truth and the second time he gives the ministry of  tears, one time he just kind of wham and the other time he just listens.

Now, you know why? Because the warrior is a nurse. He is the wonderful counselor. You and I, any, every, some of your  counselors, aren't you? You're not perfect.

I know. I've tried so hard to be a perfect counselor. And here's the problem. Sometimes where I really need to just listen and patient and hold their  hand and instead I confront them, doesn't go right. They really need to be listened to.

And other times  I listen and listen and listen and listen and I should have confronted them. I mean, I tend to confront  when I should be listening. I listen when I should confront. Sometimes I do the ministry of truth  when it should be just the ministry of tears. Other times I do the ministry of tears when I really  should be doing a ministry of truth.

But Jesus is always spot on. And that's the only reason why  he seems like a schizophrenic to you. Because he knows exactly what you need when you need it. And there's times in which for some reason he just comes in and he sort of lifts the ship and takes  you right on through. And other times he just, other times he seems to completely abandon you.

Why? He's the perfect counselor. He's the warrior and a nurse. He'll change your bedpan. He'll punch you in the chops.

See, nurses very often can't do that or they don't want to do that. They're not that kind of person. And wires, obviously, also can't change bedpounds. They're not  kind of that kind of person. But our savior is the wonderful counselor.

See, the wonderful counselor,  mighty God, everlasting father, Prince of Peace, the whole thing. Fourth. When Jesus Christ preached this text, he says, listen, he gets to the middle of the verse  and he says, the year of the Lord's favor. In other words, when Jesus Christ preached this, he got up  and he says, the spirit of the Lord is upon me, right? Because the Lord has anointed me to preach  good news of the poor.

He has sent me to bind the broken hearted to proclaim freedom for the  captives and release from the darkness for the prisoners to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor. And he stopped right in the middle of the sentence, right in the middle of the verse. And he sat  down and he says today, it begins. Well, why didn't he go on to this less part of this passage here? Why in the world didn't he come on and say, and the day of the Lord's vengeance?

What's a matter with  Jesus? And here's the answer. It's pretty clear that they're not the same thing. There's a day of vengeance coming. There's a day of judgment coming.

But it's pretty intriguing  that Isaiah, the Messiah here in Isaiah says, I've come to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor  and the day of vengeance. That means there's a period of time that's called the Jubilee. But eventually it'll be over and it'll be a day of judgment. And this is really simply what  Jesus is saying. Jesus is saying, not seize the day.

Jesus saying the Christians seize the year. Now what's that mean? It means from now, my first coming to my second coming, I want you to live  on the principles of the Jubilee. From what we can tell, when Jesus Christ preached this in the very  first time, and he literally said, I've come to declare the Jubilee, there is no indication  that he tried to set up a social program in Israel. He didn't say, look, we've got to go back  and everybody's got to get their old land, but he didn't do that.

On the other hand,  he didn't do that. On the other hand, it is silly to think that he is really talking about  his only spiritually. That is not what the text, that's not what Leviticus 25 is like. And here's  my best answer. A New Testament scholar named NT Wright has a really good passage on this in one  of his books.

And he says, Jesus Christ is calling Christians between the first and second coming of  Christ to live themselves on the Jubilee principle. That means Jesus is coming and saying,  my kingdom of God, my kingdom is here partially but not fully. And I want you to begin to sacrifice. I want you to be radically generous with each other. I want you to forgive each other to your debts.

I want you to create a community in which people really lay themselves out for the poor. I want you, a community in which you really lay yourself out for the brokenhearted. I want you to say because of what you've done for me, I am now going to be working  to bind up people in every way. I'm going to try to bring them to Christ spiritually. I'm going to try  to bring them together and bind up themselves psychologically.

I'm going to try to bring them up  socially and economically. If they're poor, I'm going to do everything I can. Does that mean I'm  going to have to be spending money? I'm going to be giving a lot of my money away. Does it mean I'm  going to be involved in people's lives?

Yes. Jesus is not saying Christians get into power and  make the Jubilee the program. But that hasn't worked. That's not the point. It doesn't mean that  Christians shouldn't be working for justice in society in general.

Yes. But what he is saying is  let's not get out from under this. Christians now redeemer. You right now begin to live on the  principles of the Jubilee. That means forgive each other spiritually and also means be unbelievably  generous with each other in every way.

Bring each other into each other's homes.

在今天的信息中,提姆·凯勒通过圣经中的故事探索人类的处境,揭示圣经对罪的论述,以及为什么这是唯一足够深刻的解释来面对关于我们自己的真相。我们将在接下来的几周,实际上是四周,来看以赛亚告诉我们关于我们有什么问题。以赛亚有一些非常引人入胜的话要说,因为他在某些方面是最伟大的旧约先知之一。我们这里看到的是关于弥赛亚以及弥赛亚将做什么的伟大预言之一。

以赛亚书61章1至11节。主耶和华的灵在我身上,因为耶和华用膏膏我,叫我传好信息给谦卑的人。他差遣我医好伤心的人,报告被掳的得释放,被囚的出监牢,报告耶和华的恩年和我们神报仇的日子,安慰一切悲哀的人,赐华冠与锡安悲哀的人代替灰尘,喜乐油代替悲哀,赞美衣代替忧伤之灵。他们必称为公义树,是耶和华所栽的,叫他显出他的荣耀。他们必修造已久的荒场,建立先前凄凉之处,重修历代荒凉之城。

外人必起来牧放你们的羊群,外邦人必作你们耕种田地的,修理葡萄园的。你们倒要称为耶和华的祭司,人必称你们为我们神的仆役。你们必吃用列国的财物,因得他们的荣耀自夸。你们必得加倍的好处代替所受的羞辱。

分中所得的喜乐必代替所受的凌辱,在境内必得加倍的产业,永远之乐必归与你们。因为我耶和华喜爱公平,恨恶抢夺和罪孽。我要凭诚实施行报应,并要与我的民立永约。

他们的后裔必在列国中被人认识,他们的子孙在众民中也是如此。凡看见他们的,必认他们是耶和华赐福的后裔。我因耶和华大大欢喜,我的心靠神快乐,因他以拯救为衣给我穿上,以公义为袍给我披上。

好像新郎戴上华冠,又像新妇佩戴妆饰。田地怎样使百谷发芽,园子怎样使所种的发生,主耶和华必照样使公义和赞美在万民中发出。这是神的话。现在,因为这是这个系列的第三篇,我们需要回顾一下我们在做什么,为什么这样做,我们走到了哪里。我们在谈论罪,做一个关于罪的系列。

为什么?嗯,因为在本世纪初,也许是19世纪末20世纪初,这不是,我们不能完全,你不能完全精确地确定这一点,基本上我们的西方社会告诉我们要摆脱罪的概念。要摆脱它。而且有一些相当好的理由。我的意思是,因为滥用,他们说,当你使用罪和邪恶这个词时,当你对自己使用罪这个词时,当你看着自己并称自己为罪人时,你只是在压垮自己。

只是让自己感到内疚,让自己感到糟糕和毫无价值,明白吗?感到羞耻。当你称其他人为罪人时,当你把罪加在他们身上时,你做同样的事情,你不仅压垮他们,让他们感到羞耻,而且可能会导致你虐待他们。他们是罪人,所以你可以用各种方式对待他们。所以罪被认为是一个危险且无益的类别。

当时的原因,至少有一些逻辑上的理由来摆脱它,是因为在同一时间,欧洲和美国的许多人都在说,你知道,我们国家和社会的麻烦和困难,人们充满暴力、压迫和自私的原因,实际上是因为不公正的社会条件,因为糟糕的教育,因为糟糕的环境。通过政治和社会变革以及科学的进步,我们可以处理这些事情。这是一种更好的表达方式。当然,它确实没有那么乐观,但我们现在有问题了。在20世纪末,我们经历了大屠杀,我们经历了两次世界大战,几年前,一本对我影响很大的书,安德鲁·德尔班科,就在这里的哥伦比亚大学写了一本叫《撒但之死》的书,引人入胜的书。

他在这里说了一些话,我会读给你听。他说,现在我们的文化中出现了一条鸿沟,介于邪恶的可见性和处理它的可用智力资源之间。然后他说得很完美。我们现在有一个不可避免的问题。我们感受到一些我们的文化不再给我们词汇来表达的东西。

现在,这很简单。看,马克思主义,至少说,我知道这是,我们知道这是错的。你知道,他们有一个理论,说什么是错的,为什么我们如此混乱。当然,马克思主义作为一个运动已经结束了。弗洛伊德主义有一个关于我们有什么问题的理论,但它作为一个运动已经结束了,你明白吗?

乐观的想法,如果我们只是教育人们,我们这样做那样做,我们就能处理,你知道,压力、种族主义、暴力等等,那已经结束了。它消失了。德尔班科说,但奇怪的是。我们摆脱了词汇。我们摆脱了罪的概念。

现在我们看到它就在我们面前,但我们无法谈论它。我们无法处理它。我们感到自己处于某种东西的面前,但我们不再有词汇来处理它。这太糟糕了。实际上,下周,或者现在几周后,回来给你一些德尔班科给出的例子。我今天晚上不能这样做。但今天,但重点是。我们必须回到圣经来获得词汇。这是我对你的主张。圣经关于罪的词汇概念被抛弃的原因,部分是因为它没有被很好地理解。

普通人,如果我问你,什么是罪?你知道,我们社会对圣经关于罪的说法的记忆很简单。罪就是违背神的律法。这让我们有罪。这是真的。

事实上,我有一篇关于这个的讲道要讲。但我想让你说,如果你从这开始,你真的不明白圣经罪论的多维度、深刻、细微差别。我们上周开始,我们说,好的,首先,罪首先是违背神的天平。它是降低神,这创造了心灵的渺小。它是拒绝将他视为荣耀的,记得吗?

然后上周,我们说,罪不仅是违背神的天平,它是伤害神的心。违背神的天平,将他视为不如他荣耀的东西,使他变小,导致精神的吝啬。但当你取代神,当你伤害他的心,拒绝他的爱时,你实际上在做的是创造成瘾,记得吗。所以罪是心灵的渺小,罪是成瘾。现在,这周我们要继续,哦,仍然,在我们理解它是违背神的律法之前,我们必须理解它是违背神的天平。

这意味着它是把他看得不如他荣耀。否则,你不理解罪。它是伤害神的心。他说,我想成为你灵魂的爱人,我们把自己投入其他爱人的怀抱,结果,我们是成瘾者。这周,我们要再看一个,在我们到达其他任何地方之前,那就是罪不仅是违背神的天平,伤害神的心。

它也是违背神对我们的设计。你根本不理解罪,除非你思考,除非你明白罪是违背神的设计。看,神的律法不仅是他心的表达,所以违背神的律法,你是在践踏他的心。神的律法也是,它是你心灵的设计蓝图。它是你被造来工作的方式。

当你违背神的律法时,你是在破坏自己。你是在践踏自己。让我们进入这个。这段经文实际上告诉我们这一点,因为它告诉我们弥赛亚将要做什么。它向我们展示的第一件事是弥赛亚将要处理生活的问题,这向我们展示了关于罪的一些东西。

所以我们将这样分解这个。我们将看到问题是什么,神将要对此做什么,以及我们应该如何回应。问题是什么,我们应该对此做什么,神将要对此做什么,我们应该如何回应。首先,问题是什么?马上,我们必须看到这是显著的。这位弥赛亚所做的所有事情,首先打动你的是它们的范围。首先,看这里。首先,他处理身体和灵魂。例如,他来到穷人那里。科勒从马太福音11章读到,耶稣非常重视这段经文。

我会告诉你他有多重视。他传讲的第一篇讲道,他选择了这段经文。现在,当你要开始一场运动时,你对第一次说什么非常小心,不是吗?因为你想确保它是完美的。它完美地传达你想要的,你的全部。当耶稣基督传讲第一篇讲道时,看,他传讲了这段经文,以赛亚书61章1和2节。首先出现的是,向穷人传道。这与经济破碎有关。但第二,看,他医好伤心的人。他在处理情感破碎。

然后它说,看,他从黑暗中释放。他从黑暗中释放。现在,你必须小心,因为它说,报告被掳的得释放,从黑暗中释放。这是两件不同的事情。它不是重复的。

他在谈论智力盲目。他在谈论属灵的盲目,看不到真理。但最后,这是,这是需要花一点时间来理解的,好吗?他说,他差遣我,他差遣我医好伤心的人,报告被掳的得释放,然后在第二节,报告耶和华的恩年。现在,这不是你通过用英语阅读就能理解的。

他在这里所做的,这个人来说,主的灵在我身上,报告主的恩年,主恩惠的年份,宣告自由。他在引用利未记25章。利未记25章在谈论禧年。这位弥赛亚的人物来说,我来带来禧年。那是什么?

好吧,让我告诉你,你听说过安息日。你听说在旧约中神对人说,七天中要有一天安息日休息。但也许你没有听说他也对人说,七年中要有一年是安息年。他不仅设立了安息日。他也设立了安息年。

安息年是这样的。在那些日子里,当有人因为歉收、不幸或判断失误,来到你如此负债以至于无法还清债务的地方。会发生的是你会成为你欠债的人的契约仆人。你会成为他们的仆人。当然,这种事情会发生。

有些人变得更富裕。有些人没有那么富裕。但每隔七年,神说安息。什么安息?在安息年,所有的债务都被免除。因此所有的仆人都获得自由。土地被生命休耕,这意味着为了积累养分,人们要从仓库里吃,而不耕种田地。所以每个人都休息。土地也休息。你从心里饶恕你弟兄的债。

你从心里饶恕你弟兄对你做的任何错事。这就是安息年。但在此之上,那是在旧约中。你可以在申命记和利未记中读到。但在利未记25章,我们有旧约中比较奇怪的部分之一。它奇怪是因为它如此激进。从我们所知道的,它从未被实践过。它总是有可能不应该被实践的。但这就是会发生的事情。你说每七天是一个安息日,每七年是一个安息年。

但每个安息的安息。换句话说,每七个安息年,这意味着第50年,禧年,每七个七年,要有一个禧年。禧年甚至更广泛。不仅所有的债务被免除,不仅所有的仆人和奴隶被释放。但如果你在那49年中任何时候失去了你的土地,歉收,判断失误,如果你失去了你的土地,你家族的原始土地,它会回到你手中。

安息年和禧年背后的整个目的是,你如何确保如果你搞砸了,你得到一个新的开始,经济上的第二次机会。你如何确保你没有长期的家庭陷入贫困文化,学习与贫困有关的习惯,其他人进入财富文化并有那些习惯。你怎么做到这一点?嗯,这就是应该这样做的方式。现在,关于这件事相当有趣的一点是,很明显,禧年不仅是为了属灵的休息而设立的制度。它不仅是你说,我要饶恕你,神已经饶恕了我的地方。而且在经济上也是如此。我饶恕你,我要给你,这样你就可以从经济上所处的地方出来。这很惊人。它真的很了不起。

据我们所知,以色列从未遵守过它。你能想象吗?弥赛亚出现并说,我带来禧年。他不仅表明这意味着身体和灵魂将被放在一起。但如果你仔细看,它还表明他来不仅处理身体和灵魂的问题,而且还处理个人和集体的问题,因为看第三节和第四节。

在第三节中,我们看到完全的个人转变。我会给你一个华冠。我们会回到那个。喜乐油,赞美衣,你将成为公义树。那是什么。那不仅仅是象征性的。公义树意味着有机的公义。神不仅要宣告你为义,他在第10节中把你裹在公义的袍子里时就这样做了。但他要真正使你成为义。他要把他的灵放在你里面。

他要把他的本性放在你里面。这就是你在第三节中所拥有的。你将从内到外完全改变。但在第四节中,我们看到他们应该去重建城市。如果你看第四节和第五节,它不只是说,哦,你知道,忘记城市。你知道,让我们建立一个新的分区。你回去重建城市。如果你仔细看,在那个城市里,将会有种族和谐。它说,它说外人将要与你一起工作。你必须小心一点,因为英语没有表达出来。

它说,例如,当它说外人将要牧放你们的羊群时,那个牧放的词不仅仅意味着你。他们将成为你的雇工。但这意味着他们将与你站在一起,他们将与你一起承担责任。有种族和谐。有城市的重建。有个人转变。有社会转变。有属灵的完整。有心理的完整。有经济的完整。

有种族的完整。全套。弥赛亚回来说,这就是我要做的。现在,这告诉我们关于罪什么?这是第一点。

这告诉我们关于罪的是。罪的工价是灰尘。你注意到在第三节中,它说,我将在你有灰尘的地方放上华冠。他在非常字面地思考,当有人死了或当你生活中发生任何真正错误的事情时,你不只是穿黑色。你所做的是放灰尘。

你走进壁炉,拿起灰尘,把它放在你的额头上。不只是一个可爱的小十字架,你说你在大斋期的许多教会里为圣灰星期三放灰尘。不,你把它倒在你的头上。想想看。你看起来很丑。你完全脏了。这就是你在说的。生活就是这样。圣经,什么是灰尘?你把东西放进火里。

火把它打散。有连贯的化学物质。你把木头放进火里,有凝聚力。有连贯性。它是整合的。有各种各样的化学物质和各种东西把它变成木头。但火做什么?火摧毁了那些应该在一起的东西。它摧毁了连贯性,它变成灰尘。如果你把手放进火里,它会变成灰尘。

如果你把纸放进火里,它会变成灰尘。但你看,当弥赛亚说,我要给你华冠代替灰尘。他实际上是在指他一直在看的整个调查中的一切。因为本质上生活就是这样。我最喜欢的例子是,有几种方式来说明它。想想你烤箱里的鸡。你把鸡拿出来。你把它放在桌子上。太热了不能吃。所以你等15分钟。

你很高兴。为什么?因为现在我可以吃它了。但你唯一能吃它的原因是因为它在失去能量。因为生活就是这样。

放三个小时。然后你就不想吃它了。它失去能量直到有点恶心。放三天。现在它是一个健康危害。放三周。但当你看着它,散架。哦,当然,如果你能烧掉它,你看,在火中,它很快就变成灰尘。但你难道看不到吗?如果你只是让它待着,它无论如何都会变成灰尘。

当你看着鸡变成灰尘时,为什么?因为存在就是那样。你在照镜子。你要变成灰尘。如果你把自己投入火中,你会很快变成灰尘。

但这无关紧要,随你怎么死。去看医生吧,随你怎么锻炼来保持自己在一起,保持自己完整,保持自己紧致,但你在扩散。你会继续扩散,直到最后,你是灰尘。你是尘土,灰尘你是。现在我们在这里谈论什么?圣经说整个世界都在罪的火焰中燃烧。当我想成为自己的主人,当我想成为自己的主,当我想成为自己的救主时,我所做的本质上只是放火,罪是对神想要的方式设计的火,那就是和平、繁荣、成长、沙洛姆,这是和平的希伯来语,但它意味着各种人类繁荣。现在你可以把这个降到微观层面。我能从微观层面出来吗?有人对你不好。你说,我不会原谅。我不会原谅。你们中的一些人现在就处于这种情况,现在。圣经说神说,我饶恕,因此你必须饶恕,你必须饶恕。

这是神的话。如果你不饶恕,那就是罪。现在让我们思考一下这个。好的。如果你犯罪,罪的后果是什么?

嗯,很多人说,我只是害怕,你知道,如果我心里保持我的罪,也许神不会回答我的祷告。也许是那样。嗯,它确实这样说。好的。所以也许你这样想罪。我最好不要犯罪,因为神在看着我。只要我保持罪恶,你知道,神要抓住我。他要看着我说,孩子,那个人在犯罪,我今天能做什么来使他们的生活悲惨?但孩子,你误解了。你误解了。

当你怀有那个怨恨时,医生会告诉你,那实际上是在提高你心脏的火焰。你更有可能有心脏问题。你更有可能有胃问题。你更有可能有身体问题,因为你生气。但不仅如此,当然,你开始在心理上崩溃。你会处于否认中。它会控制你。但是,当然,它在灵性上破坏你。罪使我们瓦解。罪使我们崩溃。

罪投放,罪是一个看不见的火焰。它对神来说是可见的。哦,神看到它。神俯视,他看到我们都在燃烧。他看到我们都分崩离析。为什么?因为我们所做的是违背我们的设计。每当你想成为自己的救主,自己的主人,这不像哦天哪,你知道,我今天做了我不应该做的事。我想知道神在哪里会抓住我。罪是有罪的,但罪首先是愚蠢的。

罪确实违背了神的律法,但神的律法只是他造你的方式。他造你去爱,而不是恨。他造你无私,而不是自私。他造你不要把所有的钱都花在自己身上。这就是为什么他说,把它给出去。他造你去饶恕。这就是为什么他说饶恕。他造你在婚姻盟约内发生性关系。这就是为什么他说要这样做。这些都不是忙碌的工作。这不像我的八年级代数老师。你过去常说,嗯,你知道,孩子们必须远离街头。所以你说,做所有这些事情来让你远离街头。那是忙碌的工作。

在神的旨意中没有忙碌的工作。神来说,我这样造你。你只有这样才能繁荣。如果你破坏这个,你破坏自己。如果你践踏这个,你是在践踏自己的心。如果你践踏这个,你是在践踏自己的世界。每次你犯罪,你只是在提高火焰,提高燃烧器,你更快地变成灰尘,你明白吗?我们到处看到的都是破碎、战争、残酷和心痛。我们在我们周围的世界和我们自己的生活中感受到它。它是怎么变成这样的?

能做些什么呢?在他本月发行的全新书中,世界有什么问题?提姆·凯勒提供了一个清晰而富有同情心的答案。从在救赎主教会的一系列教导中汲取灵感,凯勒博士展示了罪的现实如何解释我们周围看到的痛苦,以及只有福音提供持久的自由和医治。

无论你是被我们世界的状况压倒,还是在与自己的错误或选择作斗争,或者在寻找希望和喜悦,《世界有什么问题》都会帮助你看到福音如何回应我们世界的心痛和我们每个人内心的痛苦。这本新发行的书《世界有什么问题》是我们感谢你本月向福音与生命的捐赠,以帮助分享耶稣的好消息。今天在gospelandlife.com/give请求你的副本。那是gospelandlife.com/give。现在那是这一点的消极部分。让我告诉你积极的部分是什么。积极的部分是弥赛亚来处理罪的所有结果。弥赛亚来不是看弥赛亚不只是来赦免你的罪,给你心中的平安,带你去天堂。弥赛亚不是来到地球上说,让我带你离开这一切。他不这样做。

相反,他说我要给你一个喜乐和力量,这样我们可以改造世界。我可以给你一个,我要在内心重塑你。我要在内心重塑你,这样我们可以一起重塑整个世界。我的力量,我的灵,我的目标不仅仅是把你带入某个其他的神秘意识世界。听着,每一个其他宗教都这样说。

东方和西方,理想是什么?理想是什么?天堂或全灵或类似的东西。这从来不是基督教或犹太教所谈论的。它谈论新天。它谈论新地。这意味着物质是好的。耶稣不只是为了拯救我们的灵魂而死。他也复活了来拯救我们的身体。复活还有什么用呢?

因此,当弥赛亚来时,他会说,我回来使万物完整。我回来,首先,关掉火,然后重建一切,恢复一切,说,重新编织一切,使一切完整。这就是他的目标。这是你理解以赛亚许多预言的唯一方法。这就是问题。现在,神将如何做到这一点?答案就在这位了不起的弥赛亚身上。现在,这位弥赛亚,在第1节,再次,我必须给你一点帮助。作为一个英语读者,它不会立即打动你。但无论如何,这位特别的弥赛亚,马上,我们被告知主耶和华的灵在我身上,因为主用膏膏我传道。现在,在我们继续之前,主用膏膏我传道。现在,这就是它所说的。如果你真的读所有的以赛亚书,你知道,这很难,我想承认,我不想让任何人感到内疚,因为它太难了。读以赛亚书很难。这是一本长书。但我直到因为你,因为我必须为你做这件事,我必须读整本书。在我生命中第一次,我意识到有一个叙事,当你读这本书时,有一个巨大的危机即将到来第61章。因为在以赛亚书的早期部分,我们被告知将会有这位强大的、令人难以置信的大卫王,一个将要举起旗帜的人。事实上,在以赛亚书11章1和2节中说,这位伟大的王将要来,他将要举起旗帜,他将是荣耀的,他将要召集国家,他将要镇压所有的邪恶,他将要使整个世界正确。它说,主的灵将在他身上做这件事。

所以这是对诗篇2篇,以赛亚书11章的引用。这对我们来说是有道理的。他们说,是的,世界是一团糟。我们需要有人来拯救我们。但在以赛亚书的中间部分,从以赛亚书42章开始,突然一个新的人物出现在这些预言中。

这个人物完全不同于旧的,早期章节的受膏的王。完全不像受膏的王,这就是文学中所谓的仆人。在以赛亚书42章,以赛亚书49章,以赛亚书50章,和以赛亚书53章,我们下周要讲。一个新的人物出现了。我们被告知他没有吸引力。他完全不像受膏的征服者。受膏的征服者是荣耀的,我们都想要他。这个我们被告知,以赛亚书53章没有美丽。没有美丽让我们渴望他。我们被告知,当然,伟大的受膏的征服者将继续走向胜利。

然而,这个人物将要受苦。这个人物完全不强壮。我们告诉关于这个人物什么?我们被告知他没有美丽让我们渴望他,但我们也被告知像羊羔在剪毛的人面前沉默。所以他没有开口。他被带去屠杀。他被比作一只小羊羔。他被比作一只母羊羔。他被比作动物王国中最弱小的生物之一。所以这是一个完全不同的人。

然后第一个人,为什么以赛亚这样做?发生了什么?这个人是谁?但我们在以赛亚书42章第1节被告知,这个仆人是被灵膏抹的人。这就是为什么当你来到以赛亚书61章,第1节时,如果你一直在阅读它,特别是用希伯来语阅读,这是他们最初所做的,你突然,你的下巴掉下来,打到你的胸部顶部。

你不敢相信,因为到目前为止,你要么有一个受苦的、甜蜜的、善良的、牺牲的、丑陋的、被击败的人,要么你有这个令人难以置信的,你知道,这个征服者,这个强者,这个荣耀的,这个美丽的。突然,我们看到他们是同一个人。正如以赛亚书61章所说,这是同一个人,因为他不仅宣告被掳的得自由,他医好伤心的人。战士是护士。这怎么可能是同一个人?

但以赛亚说,这是我的突破。这是我的神学突破。这是主向我显示的。胜利将是失败。强者将是极其软弱的。

救恩不会通过你,召集你的力量并服从这位伟大的王来实现。它将发生是因为这位伟大的王将变得极其软弱,受苦,被击败和死亡。现在,有人说,这怎么可能?为什么会这样?我不明白。

答案是,在第三节中,三个小词代替。三个小词代替。它说,我要赐华冠给锡安悲哀的人,代替灰尘,喜乐油代替悲哀,赞美衣代替忧伤之灵。现在,这不是太糟糕的翻译。它有点理解它。

但基本上,我们被告知弥赛亚不只是说,你有你的灰尘。让我把华冠放在你的灰尘上面,对吗?他不是说,你有你的,你知道,你有你的悲哀,但让我,让我在你上面涂油。不,他说,我会给你我拥有的。你给我你拥有的。我们这里有的是替代的原则。突然,我们意识到为什么他不美丽。为什么他不美丽?因为我们得到了他的美丽。他得到了我们的灰尘。为什么我们喜乐?因为他得到了他的喜乐。他得到了我们的绝望。这就是为什么在十字架上,他呼喊,我的神,我的神,为什么你离弃我?我的意思是,那是绝望。

我们得到了他的绝望。对不起。他得到了我们的绝望。你明白吗?这意味着他必须如此难以置信地强大。你难道不明白吗?如果你是一只羊羔,面对你的剪毛人或面对你的剪毛人,那是一回事。如果你是一只羊羔,面对那些要杀死你的人,那是一回事。你看,以某种镇定,如果你不是羊羔而成为羊羔,那是另一回事。如果你是丑陋的,忍受它是一回事。

如果你是美丽的,自愿变得丑陋是另一回事。其他人可以美丽。你明白正在发生什么吗?看他自愿的丑陋之美。看他自愿的软弱之力量。他必须那么强大。如果他能,他必须是第一个人物才能成为第二个人物。当然,成为第二个人物,他不是他本来的样子,而是他必须做的事情。他为我们做了。因此,替代。耶稣基督,当他来到地球上时,能够处理罪的火焰,因为他个人必须经历罪的毁灭的每一个方面。他在身体上被破坏。这就是为什么他得到灰尘。他在心理上被破坏。这就是为什么他得到悲哀。他在灵性上被破坏,因为父离弃了他。他像,神,我的神,为什么我停止离弃我,所以他得到了绝望的灵。现在,这对我们实际上意味着什么?让我们来看看。让我们列一个小清单。

我们应该如何回应?第一,请信靠他。现在,这就是我所说的。第一件事是,看第11节,土壤是什么使树苗生长。你明白吗?

如果我拿一个橡果,我把它握在手中,我可以走来走去好多年。你知道会发生什么吗?什么都不会发生。为什么?因为是土壤给橡果提供生长的力量,或者至少打开橡果中的生长力量。

是土壤。是养分。是水分。如果我只是握着它,我只是一直带着它走。什么都没有。

第11节说,土壤最终会把我们从灰尘中转变,你知道,没有土壤,最终橡果会变成灰尘。如果我只是带着它走,最终它会分崩离析。它必须被种植。所以我们被告知主的主权。那个词主权的主是相当不寻常的。

主权意味着王的王性。那是你的灵魂可以生长的土壤。对他的顺服。现在你看,如果我们只知道他是以赛亚前半部分的王,而不是以赛亚后半部分的王,我知道你无法处理它,但我们很多人无论如何都无法处理它。让我说实话。你们中很多人说我想从神那里得到一些东西。我害怕说我顺服。我害怕说我投降。我只是害怕。我知道为什么,因为你心里有一部分说,如果我真的,真的对神说,你说的任何话,我都会做,你派的任何事,我都会接受。

看,那就是顺服。那就是在土壤下面。那就是把你的灵魂放在他的主权之下。说你告诉我的任何话,无论我对它感觉如何,我都会做。无论它实际上看起来如何,我都会做。然后无论你派给我什么,我都会接受。那就是把自己放在土壤下面。我们被告知你的灵魂需要他的王权。除非那发生,你永远不会成长。火永远不会开始被关闭。燃烧器不会被关小,除非那发生。你知道吗,你们中很多人在说,我害怕那样做。当然,他可能会要求我做一些我不想做的事。嗯,当然,亚伯拉罕不想把以撒带上山。耶稣不想去十字架。

我不是说他不会要求你做一些你不想做的事。当然,他会那样做。但除非耶稣说,除非种子落在地里死了,它不能结果子。讽刺的是,种子可以在地下死。它成为伟大而美丽的东西。它可以在地上死,但它无论如何都会以一种或另一种方式死,你会以一种或另一种方式死。你可以成为自己的主人和自己的主。

你会变成灰尘,或者你可以向你的意志死。你可以向按你自己的方式领导你自己的生活死。你想要屈服吗?我会做你说的任何事。无论我看到你的意志是什么,我都会做,无论如何。无论你派给我什么,我都会接受。第1节说,王的主权。你可以信靠他。

第11节说,王的主权。它会使你成长,但整段经文在说,但这是为你屈服的王。这是为你失去一切的王。想想你,如果你真的说,我要完全把自己献给耶稣基督,你可能会放弃什么?当然你会放弃一些东西。你认为你会放弃像他放弃的任何东西吗?他说,如果你放弃这些东西,你所要放弃的只是这个,如果你放弃你的权利,你会放弃你的绝望。如果你放弃你的权利,你会放弃你的灰尘。我拿走了你的灰尘。你只会从我这里得到美丽。我拿走了你的悲哀。你只会从我这里得到喜乐。你难道不明白吗?这是第一件事。

战士是护士。屈服。这是第一件事。第二件事。非常重要。

除非你看到他既是受苦的仆人又是伟大的主,你无法成为基督徒。你知道为什么吗?你看,如果你只是把他看作这位伟大的主,我要顺服。我只是要顺服。那不是使你成为基督徒的。使你成为基督徒的是第10节。这是以赛亚开始说话。以赛亚实际上给了我们预言。是弥赛亚在说话。耶稣基督在说话。

但当你到达那里第8和9节时,突然你看到,看它。突然以赛亚开始说话。他开始谈论这个,这就是以赛亚说的。他给我披上。事实上,我偏离了NIV。他给我披上公义的袍子。成为基督徒意味着什么?它意味着不说,我足够强大,我可以跟随王。我会顺服。然后我会得到他的祝福。哦不,不。我们必须看到它。他比那更强大。他比那更强大。我们不只是有一个来说跟从我的王。我们有一个首先来说,我要死的王。我要成为你需要成为的一切。我要代替你。所以我不要求你达到一个公义。我要给你一个公义。

我要把它种在你心里。我要把它裹在你的身体和灵魂周围。你会得到我的公义,我的喜乐,看?我的美丽。这就是你要得到的。所以如果你说,我从现在开始要过真正好的生活,你就不是基督徒。那不是真正的死,顺便说一句。你可能认为,哦,我不再是自己的主,但你是自己的救主。如果你是自己的救主,你就是自己的主。你必须愿意说,我放弃我对自己生活的权利,因为你为我做了一切,除了我。

哦,父,为了耶稣所做的。那会使你成为基督徒。你必须把两者放在一起,否则你无法成为基督徒。第三,基督徒朋友们,除非你看到他既是征服的英雄,征服受膏的征服者又是受苦的仆人。你不会真正理解他在你自己生活中与你打交道的方式。这是我知道的一件事。有时我做一些非常愚蠢的事,神只是让我摆脱困境。他只是,你知道,我说,我做了一些非常愚蠢的事。请帮助我。不知何故他保护我。他让它过去,好吗,对吗?所以有时只是真的很愚蠢的事,一切都很好。其他时候我只是做一点点愚蠢的事。

然后砰,砰,砰,砰。你说,再打我一次,主。我还在呼吸。为什么会这样?我永远不会忘记我听迪克·卢卡斯关于约翰福音11章的录音带,耶稣来到拉撒路的坟墓,两个姐妹出来见他。你记得这个吗?马大来说,如果你在这里,我兄弟拉撒路就不会死。好的。就像三节经文之后,马利亚来见他,另一个姐妹说,如果我兄弟,如果你在这里,我兄弟拉撒路就不会死。如果你仔细看,这是同样的话。这是同一个地方。这是同样的情况。这是同样的条件。我的天哪。这是名字都以MA开头的女人。我的意思是,一切都是一样的。在第一种情况下,耶稣做什么?

他对马大说,马大,我是复活和生命。这真的是在脸上。我知道当我们读它时,我们听到,我是复活和生命。他,你知道,是的,但看看上下文。他有点,他在让马大这样。他真的在说,马大,我是复活和生命。如果我在这里,当我在这里时,你活着。什么时候都没关系。他说,我是复活和生命。所以他有点在面对她。

但当马利亚上来,说同样的问题,做同样的陈述,对不起,以同样的方式追在他后面。他做什么?你记得吗?他只是哭泣。看,第一次他给予真理的事工,第二次他给予眼泪的事工,一次他只是有点砰,另一次他只是倾听。现在,你知道为什么吗?因为战士是护士。他是奇妙的策士。你和我,任何,每个,你们中有些人是辅导员,不是吗?你不完美。

我知道。我努力成为一个完美的辅导员。这就是问题。有时我真的需要只是倾听和耐心,牵着他们的手,相反我面对他们,不太对。他们真的需要被倾听。其他时候我倾听又倾听又倾听又倾听,我应该面对他们。我的意思是,我倾向于在应该倾听时面对。我在应该面对时倾听。有时我在应该只是眼泪的事工时做真理的事工。其他时候我在真正应该做真理的事工时做眼泪的事工。

但耶稣总是恰到好处。这就是他对你来说似乎像精神分裂的唯一原因。因为他确切地知道你什么时候需要什么。有些时候因为某种原因他只是进来,他有点抬起船,直接带你通过。其他时候他只是,其他时候他似乎完全抛弃你。为什么?他是完美的辅导员。他是战士和护士。他会换你的便盆。他会揍你的脸。

看,护士通常不能那样做,或者他们不想那样做。他们不是那种人。当然,战士也不能换便盆。他们不是那种人。但我们的救主是奇妙的策士。看,奇妙的策士,全能的神,永在的父,和平的君,全套。第四。当耶稣基督传讲这段经文时,他说,听着,他到达节的中间,他说,主恩惠的年份。换句话说,当耶稣基督传讲这个时,他站起来说,主的灵在我身上,对吗?因为主用膏膏我传好消息给穷人。他差遣我医好伤心的人,报告被掳的得释放,从黑暗中释放囚犯,报告主恩惠的年份。他在句子中间停下来,在节的中间停下来。他坐下来说今天,它开始了。嗯,为什么他没有继续到这段经文的后面部分?为什么他没有继续说,和主报仇的日子?

耶稣怎么了?答案是。很明显,它们不是同一件事。有一个报仇的日子要来。有一个审判的日子要来。但相当有趣的是,以赛亚,这里以赛亚书中的弥赛亚说,我来宣告主恩惠的年份和报仇的日子。这意味着有一段时间被称为禧年。但最终它会结束,将会有一个审判的日子。这真的只是耶稣所说的。耶稣在说,不是抓住这一天。耶稣说基督徒抓住这一年。现在这意味着什么?这意味着从现在开始,我的第一次降临到我的第二次降临,我要你们按照禧年的原则生活。据我们所知,当耶稣基督第一次传讲这个时,他真的说,我来宣告禧年,没有迹象表明他试图在以色列建立一个社会项目。他没有说,看,我们必须回去,每个人都必须拿回他们的旧土地,但他没有那样做。另一方面,他没有那样做。另一方面,如果认为他只是在谈论属灵上的,那是愚蠢的。那不是这段经文,那不是利未记25章的样子。这是我最好的答案。一位新约学者名叫NT赖特在他的一本书中有一段关于这个的非常好的段落。

他说,耶稣基督呼召基督徒在基督的第一次和第二次降临之间按禧年原则生活。这意味着耶稣来说,我的神的国,我的国在这里部分但不完全。我要你们开始牺牲。我要你们彼此激进地慷慨。我要你们彼此饶恕债务。我要你们创造一个社区,在其中人们真正为穷人付出。我要你们,一个你真正为伤心的人付出的社区。我要你说因为你为我做的,我现在要努力以各种方式医好人们。我要在灵性上把他们带到基督那里。我要在心理上把他们医好。我要在社会和经济上把他们提升起来。如果他们很穷,我要尽我所能。这意味着我要花钱吗?我要把我的很多钱给出去。这意味着我要参与人们的生活吗?

是的。耶稣不是说基督徒掌权,使禧年成为计划。但那没有奏效。那不是重点。这并不意味着基督徒不应该为社会的正义而努力。是的。但他所说的是让我们不要逃避这个。基督徒现在救赎主。你现在开始按禧年的原则生活。这意味着在灵性上彼此饶恕,也意味着以各种方式彼此令人难以置信地慷慨。把彼此带入彼此的家中。

在今天的信息中，提姆·凯勒通过圣经中的故事探索人类的处境，揭示圣经对罪的看法，以及为什么它是唯一足够深刻的解释，能让我们面对关于自己的真相。在接下来的几周，实际上是四周时间，我们将探讨以赛亚告诉我们关于我们问题所在的内容。以赛亚有一些非常引人入胜的话要说，因为他在某些方面是旧约中最伟大的先知中篇幅最长的。我们在这里看到的是关于弥赛亚以及弥赛亚将要做什么的伟大预言之一。

以赛亚书61章1至11节。主耶和华的灵在我身上，因为耶和华用膏膏我，叫我传好信息给谦卑的人。差遣我医好伤心的人，报告被掳的得释放，被囚的出监牢，报告耶和华的恩年，和我们神报仇的日子，安慰一切悲哀的人，赐华冠与锡安悲哀的人代替灰尘，喜乐油代替悲哀，赞美衣代替忧伤之灵。使他们称为公义树，是耶和华所栽的，叫他显出他的荣耀。他们必修造已久的荒场，建立先前凄凉之处，重修历代荒凉之城。

那时，外人必起来牧放你们的羊群，外邦人必作你们耕种田地的，修理葡萄园的。你们倒要称为耶和华的祭司，人必称你们为我们神的仆役。你们必吃用列国的财物，因得他们的荣耀自夸。你们必得加倍的好处代替所受的羞辱。

分中所得的喜乐必代替所受的凌辱，在境内必得加倍的产业，永远之乐必归与他们。因为我耶和华喜爱公平，恨恶抢夺和罪孽。我要凭诚实施行报应，并要与我的民立永约。

他们的后裔必在列国中被人认识，他们的子孙在众民中也是如此。凡看见他们的，必认他们是耶和华赐福的后裔。我因耶和华大大欢喜。

我的灵因我的神而欢欣，因为他以救恩的衣裳给我穿上，以公义的外袍给我披上。

正如新郎像祭司一样装饰他的头，又如新娘以她的珠宝装饰自己。因为正如土壤使嫩芽长出，园子使种子生长，照样，主耶和华必使公义和赞美在万国面前发出。这是神的话语。现在，因为这是系列讲道的第三讲，我们需要回顾一下我们在做什么，为什么要这样做，以及我们已经讲到了哪里。我们正在谈论罪，做一个关于罪的系列讲道。

为什么呢？因为在本世纪初，或许是19世纪末，20世纪初，这个，我们不能完全，你不能精确地指出确切时间，基本上我们西方社会告诉我们要摆脱罪的概念。要摆脱它。而且有一些相当好的理由。我的意思是，因为那些滥用，他们说，当你使用罪和恶这个词时，当你对自己使用罪这个词时，当你审视自己并称自己为罪人时，你只会压垮自己。

只会让自己感到内疚，让自己感到糟糕和毫无价值，明白吗？感到羞耻。而当你称其他人为罪人时，当你把罪加在他们身上时，你也做同样的事，你不仅压垮他们并让他们感到羞耻，而且这可能会导致你虐待他们。他们是罪人，所以你可以用各种方式对待他们。所以罪被认为是一个危险而无益的范畴。

而当时的原因，至少有一些逻辑上的理由要摆脱它，是因为在同一时期，欧洲和美国有很多很多人这样说，他们说，嗯，你知道，我们国家和我们社会的麻烦和困难，人们充满暴力、压迫和自私的原因，实际上是因为不公正的社会条件，因为糟糕的教育，因为糟糕的环境。通过政治和社会变革以及科学的进步，我们可以处理这些事情。这是一种好得多的表述方式。当然，这样做不会造成那么多

充满乐观，但我们现在有一个问题。在20世纪末，我们经历了大屠杀，我们经历了两次世界大战，几年前，有一本对我影响很大的书，哥伦比亚大学的安德鲁·德尔班科写了一本叫《撒但之死》的书，一本引人入胜的书。

他在书中说了一些话，我读给你们听。他说，在我们的文化中，邪恶的可见性与可用来应对它的智识资源之间出现了一道鸿沟。然后他说得很完美。我们现在有一个无法逃避的问题。我们感受到某种东西，但我们的文化不再给我们表达它的词汇。

现在，这很简单。看，马克思主义至少说，我知道它，我们知道它是错的。你知道，他们有一个理论来解释什么是错的，为什么，为什么我们如此混乱。当然，马克思主义作为一个运动已经结束了。弗洛伊德主义有一个关于我们出了什么问题的理论，但它作为一个运动也结束了，你明白吗？

那种乐观的想法，认为如果我们只是教育人们，我们做这做那，我们就能处理，你知道，压力和种族主义和暴力等等，那已经结束了。它消失了。德尔班科说，但这里有一个奇怪的事情。我们摆脱了词汇。我们摆脱了罪的概念。

而现在我们在面前看到它，却无法谈论它。我们无法处理它。我们感觉自己处在某种东西的面前，而我们不再有词汇来处理它。这太可怕了。事实上，下周，或者现在过几周，回来我会给你们举一些德尔班科给出的例子。

我今晚做不到那个。但今天，但重点是这个。我们必须回到圣经中去获得词汇。这是我对你们的主张。圣经关于罪的词汇概念被抛弃的原因，部分是因为它没有被很好地理解。

普通人，如果我问你，什么是罪？你知道，我们社会对圣经关于罪所说的记忆是很简单的。罪就是违背上帝的律法。这使我们有罪。这是真的。

实际上，我有一篇关于这个的讲道即将到来。但我想让你说，如果你从那个开始，你真的不明白那种多维度的，

圣经关于罪的教义是深刻而细腻的。我们上周开始讲了，好的，首先，罪的第一件事是罪就是打破上帝的尺度。它贬低了上帝，这创造了灵里的狭隘。它拒绝将他当作荣耀的存在来对待，记得吗？

然后上周我们说，罪不仅仅是打破上帝的尺度，它还打破了上帝的心。打破上帝的尺度，将他当作比实际更不荣耀的存在来对待，使他显得太渺小，这导致了灵里的吝啬。但是当你取代上帝，当你打破他的心并拒绝他的爱时，你实际上在做的是创造了成瘾，记得这一点。所以罪是灵里的狭隘，罪是成瘾。现在，这周我们要继续，哦，还是，在我们到达打破上帝律法的概念之前，我们必须理解它是打破上帝的尺度。

这意味着它将他当作比实际更不荣耀的存在来对待。否则，你就不理解罪。它打破了上帝的心。他说，我想成为你灵魂的爱人，而我们把自己投入其他爱人的怀抱，结果，我们成了瘾君子。这一周，在我们进入其他内容之前，我们要再看一点，那就是罪不仅仅是打破上帝的尺度、打破上帝的心。

它也打破了上帝为我们设定的设计。你根本不理解罪，除非你思考，除非你理解罪是打破上帝的设计。看，上帝的律法不仅仅是他心意的表达，所以打破上帝的律法，你是在践踏他的心。上帝的律法也是你心灵的设计蓝图。它是你被造成的运作方式。

当你打破上帝的律法时，你打破了你自己。你在践踏你自己。让我们深入探讨这一点。这段经文实际上告诉我们这一点，因为它告诉我们弥赛亚将要做什么。它向我们展示的第一件事是，弥赛亚将要处理生命的问题，这向我们显示了关于罪的一些事情。

所以我们将这样分解它。我们将看到问题是什么，上帝将要对此做什么，以及我们应该如何回应。问题是什么，我们应该做什么，上帝将要对此做什么，我们应该如何回应。首先，

问题是什么？立刻，我们就必须看到这是非凡的。

这位弥赛亚所做的一切事情，首先击中你的是它们的范围。首先，看看这里。首先，他同时处理身体和灵魂。例如，他来到穷人中间。科勒从马太福音11章读到，耶稣非常看重这段经文。

我告诉你他有多看重。他讲的第一篇讲道，他就选择了这段经文。现在，当你要开始一个运动时，你会非常小心你第一次说什么，不是吗？因为你想确保它是完美的。它完美地传达了你想要传达的，你的全部意义。

当耶稣基督讲他的第一篇讲道，看看，他讲的是这段经文，以赛亚书61章1-2节。首先出现的，是向穷人传道。这与经济破碎有关。但其次，看，他医治伤心的人。他在处理情感的破碎。

然后它说，看，他从黑暗中释放。他从黑暗中释放。现在，你必须小心，因为它说，宣告被掳的得释放，从黑暗中得释放。这是两件不同的事情。它不是重复的。

他在谈论智识的盲目。他在谈论属灵的盲目，看不见真理。但最后，这是，这需要花一点时间来理解，好吗？他说，他差遣我来医治伤心的人，宣告被掳的得释放，然后到第二节，宣告耶和华的恩年。现在，这不是你通过读英文就能理解的。

他在这里所做的，这个人来说，耶和华的灵在我身上，要宣告主所悦纳的禧年，耶和华的恩年，宣告自由。他在引用利未记25章。利未记25章讲的是禧年。这位弥赛亚人物来说，我来是要带来禧年。那是什么？

好吧，让我告诉你，你听说过安息日。你听说过在旧约中神对百姓说，七日中有一日安息日休息。但也许你没有听说过他

也对百姓说，每七年必须有一个安息年。他不仅设立了安息日，还设立了安息年。

安息年是这样的。在那个时代，当有人因为庄稼歉收、不幸遭遇或判断失误，而陷入无法偿还债务的境地时，会发生什么呢？你会成为债主的契约仆人。你会成为他们的仆人。这种事情当然会发生。

有些人变得更富裕。有些人则没那么富裕。但每到第七年，神说安息。什么是安息？在安息年里，所有债务都被免除了。

因此，所有仆人都得自由。土地要休耕，这意味着为了恢复土壤的养分，人们要吃储藏的粮食，不耕种田地。所以每个人都休息。土地也休息。你要从心里饶恕你的弟兄，免除他们的债务。

你要从心里饶恕你的弟兄，免除彼此之间的过错。这就是安息年。但除此之外，这是在旧约里。你可以在申命记和利未记中读到。但在利未记25章，我们看到旧约中比较奇特的部分之一。

之所以奇特，是因为它太激进了。而且据我们所知，它从未被实践过。也有可能本来就不应该被实践。但会发生这样的事。你说每七天是安息日，每七年是安息年。

但每个安息的安息。换句话说，每七个安息年，也就是第五十年，禧年，每七个七年，会有一个禧年。禧年更为广泛。不仅所有债务被免除，不仅所有仆人和奴隶得自由。而且如果你在这49年里失去了土地，无论是因为庄稼歉收还是判断失误，如果你失去了你家族原本的土地，它会归还给你。

安息年和禧年背后的整个目的是，如果你搞砸了，如何确保你能有一个新的起点，在经济上有第二次机会。如何确保你

没有长期的家庭，深入到贫困文化之中，学习与贫困相关的习惯，其他人进入到财富文化中并拥有那些习惯。你怎么做到这一点？嗯，这就是应该做的方式。现在，关于这一点，有一件事是相当有趣的，那就是禧年显然是一个不仅仅是为了属灵安息的制度。

它不仅仅是一个你会说"我要原谅你，上帝也原谅了我"的地方。而且在经济上也是如此。我原谅你,我会给你,这样你就能在经济上从你所在的地方走出来。这是令人震惊的。而且这确实是相当了不起的。

据我们所知，以色列从未遵守过它。你能想象吗？弥赛亚出现了并说，我带来了禧年。他不仅表明这意味着身体和灵魂将被整合在一起。但如果你仔细观察，它还表明他来不仅要处理身体和灵魂的问题，还要处理个人和群体的问题，因为看看第三节和第四节。

在第三节中，我们看到完全的个人转变。我会给你华冠代替灰尘。我们会回到这一点。喜乐油代替悲哀，赞美衣代替忧伤之灵，你们必称为公义的橡树。就是这样。

这不仅仅是象征性的。公义的橡树意味着有机的公义。上帝不仅仅是要宣告你为义，虽然他在第十节中用公义的袍子包裹你时确实这样做了。但他要使你真正地成为义。他要将他的灵放在你里面。

他要将他的性情放在你里面。这就是你在第三节中所拥有的。你将从里到外完全被改变。但在第四节中，我们看到他们应该去重建城市。如果你看第四节和第五节，它不只是说，哦，你知道，忘记那些城市吧。

你知道，让我们建立一个新的分区。你要回去重建那些城市。如果你仔细看，在那个城市里，将会有种族和谐。它说，它说外族人将与你一起工作。你必须小心一点，因为

英语并没有把这层意思表达出来。

例如,当它说外邦人将牧养你的羊群时,那个"牧养"一词不仅仅是指你。他们将成为你的雇工。但这意味着他们将与你同站,与你一起承担责任。这里有种族和谐。这里有城市的重建。

这里有个人的转变。这里有社会的转变。这里有属灵的完整。这里有心理的完整。这里有经济的完整。

这里有种族的完整。应有尽有。弥赛亚回来说,这就是我将要做的事。那么,这告诉我们关于罪的什么信息?这是第一点。

它告诉我们关于罪的是:罪的代价就是灰烬。你注意到第三节说,我要把华冠赐给你,代替灰烬。他想得很具体,当有人去世或者当你生活中发生任何真正糟糕的事情时,你不只是穿上黑衣服。你所做的是拿灰烬。

你走到壁炉前,拿起灰烬,把它们涂在额头上。不只是一个可爱的小十字架,就像今天许多教会在圣灰星期三涂灰那样。不,你把灰倒在头上。想想看。你看起来很丑。

你完全肮脏。这就是你在说的:生活就是这样。圣经中,灰烬是什么?你把东西放进火里。

火把它拆散。原本连贯的化学物质,你把木头放进火里,它们有凝聚力。它们有连贯性。它们是整合的。

有各种各样的化学物质和各种东西把它变成木头。但火做了什么?火摧毁了那些使本应在一起的东西保持在一起的力量。它摧毁了连贯性,变成了灰烬。如果你把手放进火里,它会变成灰烬。

如果你把纸放进火里,它也会变成灰烬。但你看,当弥赛亚说,我要用华美代替灰烬时,他实际上是在指他一直在审视的整体情况。因为生活本质上就是那样。我最喜欢的例证

是的,有几种方式可以说明这一点。

想象一只烤箱里的鸡。你把鸡拿出来,放在桌子上。太烫了吃不了。所以你等了15分钟。

然后你很高兴。为什么?因为现在我可以吃了。但你能吃它的唯一原因是它正在失去能量。因为生命就是这样。

放它三个小时。然后你就不想吃了。它失去能量,直到变得有点恶心。放它三天。现在它成了健康隐患。

放它三周。当你看着它,分崩离析。哦,当然,如果你能把它烧掉,你看,在火里,它会很快变成灰烬。但你难道看不出来吗?如果你就让它这样放着,它无论如何都会变成灰烬。

当你看着鸡变成灰烬,为什么?因为存在的方式就是这样。你在照镜子。你也会变成灰烬。如果你把自己投入火中,你会很快变成灰烬。

但如果这无关紧要,随便去死吧。随便去看医生吧,好吗?随便去锻炼吧,为了保持自己的完整,为了保持自己的整体,为了保持自己的紧实,但你在扩散。你将继续扩散,直到最后,你成为灰烬。你是尘土,尘归尘,灰归灰。

现在我们在谈论什么?圣经说整个世界都在罪的火焰中燃烧。当我想成为自己的主人,当我想成为自己的主,当我想成为自己的救主时,我所做的本质上就是放火,罪是与神为事物设计的方式作对的火,而神的方式是和平、繁荣、成长、沙龙(shalom),这是希伯来语中和平的词,但它意味着各种人类的繁荣。现在你可以把这个缩小到微观层面。我能从微观层面出来吗?

有人对你不好。你说,我不会原谅。我不会原谅。你们中的一些人现在就处在这种情况中,就是现在。圣经说神说,我饶恕,所以你必须饶恕,你必须饶恕。

这是神的话语。如果你不饶恕,那就是罪。现在让我们想一想这个。好吧。如果你犯罪,罪的后果是什么?

嗯,很多人说,我只是害怕,你知道,

也许如果我心里保留着罪,上帝就不会回应我的祷告。也许就是这样。嗯,确实是这么说的。好吧。所以也许你是这样看待罪的。

我最好不要犯罪,因为上帝在某种程度上在看着我。只要我一直犯罪,你知道,上帝会抓住我。他会看着我说,哇,那个人在犯罪,我今天能做什么让他们的生活变得悲惨呢?但是,你误解了。你误解了。

当你怀有那种怨恨时,医生会告诉你,那实际上是在给你的心脏加火。你更有可能出现心脏问题。你更有可能出现胃部问题。你更有可能出现身体问题,因为你在生气。但不仅如此,当然,你开始在心理上崩溃。

你会否认。它会控制你。但是,当然,它在灵性上击垮了你。罪使我们分崩离析。罪使我们崩溃。

罪把,罪是一团无形的火焰。它对上帝来说是可见的。哦,上帝看得见它。上帝俯视,他看到我们都在燃烧。他看到我们都在分崩离析。

为什么?因为我们所做的是违背我们的设计。每当你想成为自己的救主,自己的主人,这不像是哦天哪,你知道,今天我做了不该做的事。我想知道上帝会在哪里抓住我。罪是有罪的,但罪首先是愚蠢的。

罪确实违背了上帝的律法,但上帝的律法只是他建造你的方式。他建造你去爱,而不是去恨。他建造你无私,而不是自私。他建造你不要把所有的钱都花在自己身上。这就是为什么他说,把它送出去。

他建造你去原谅。这就是为什么他说原谅。他建造你在婚姻的盟约中发生性行为。这就是为什么他说要这样做。

这些都不是忙碌的工作。这不像我八年级的代数老师。你过去常说,嗯,你知道,孩子们必须远离街头。所以你说,做所有这些事情让你远离街头。那是忙碌的工作。

在上帝的旨意中没有忙碌的工作。上帝来说,我以这种方式建造了你。你只有这样才能兴旺。如果你违背这个,你就会伤害自己。如果你践踏这个,你就是在践踏你自己的心。

如果你践踏这个，你就是在践踏你自己的世界。而且每次你犯罪，你只是在把火焰调高，调高炉火，你就更快化为灰烬，明白了吗？我们放眼望去，到处都是破碎、战争、残酷和心痛。我们在周围的世界和我们自己的生活中都感受到了这一切。它是如何变成这样的？

对此又能做些什么呢？在他本月即将发行的全新著作《世界到底怎么了？》中，提姆·凯勒给出了一个清晰而富有同情心的答案。凯勒博士从在救赎主教会的一系列教导中汲取内容，展示了罪的现实如何解释我们周围看到的痛苦，以及只有福音才能带来持久的自由和医治。

无论你是被我们世界的状况所压倒，正在与自己的错误或选择作斗争，还是在寻找希望和喜乐，《世界到底怎么了？》都将帮助你看到福音如何既回应我们世界的心痛，也回应我们每个人内心的痛苦。这本新发行的书《世界到底怎么了？》是我们感谢你本月给予"福音与生活"的捐赠，帮助分享耶稣的好消息。今天就在 gospelandlife.com/give 索取你的副本。那就是 gospelandlife.com/give。现在这是这个要点的消极部分。

让我告诉你积极的部分是什么。积极的部分是弥赛亚来处理罪的所有后果。弥赛亚来不是——看弥赛亚来不仅仅是为了赦免你的罪，给你内心小小的平安，然后带你去天堂。弥赛亚不是来到地上说，让我带你离开这一切。他不是这样做的。

相反，他说我要给你一种喜乐和能力，这样我们就能改造世界。我能给你一种——我要给你带来内在的喜乐和能力。我要在你内心重塑你，这样我们就能一起重塑整个世界。我的能力，我的灵，我的目标不仅仅是把你带入某个其他的神秘意识世界。听着，其他每个宗教都是这么说的。

东方和西方的，理想是什么？理想是什么？天堂或者全灵之类的东西。但基督教或犹太教从来不是这样说的。它谈论的是

新天。

它谈到新地。这意味着物质是好的。耶稣不仅为拯救我们的灵魂而死。他也复活来拯救我们的身体。否则复活是为了什么？

因此,当弥赛亚来临时,他会说,我回来是要使万物完全。我回来,首先要熄灭火焰,然后重建一切,恢复一切,说,重新编织一切,使一切完全。这就是他的目的。这是理解以赛亚书中许多预言的唯一方法。这就是问题所在。

现在,神要如何做到这一点呢？答案就在这位伟大的弥赛亚身上。现在,这位弥赛亚,在第1节中,我必须再给你一些帮助。作为英文读者,这一点不会立刻触动你。但无论如何,这位特别的弥赛亚,我们立刻被告知,主耶和华的灵在我身上,因为耶和华膏我传福音。

现在,在我们继续之前,耶和华膏我传福音。这是在说什么呢。如果你真正读完整本以赛亚书,你知道,这很难,我想承认,我不想让任何人因为太难而感到内疚。读以赛亚书确实很难。这是一本很长的书。

但我没有意识到,直到因为你们,因为我必须为你们做这个,我必须读完整本书。在我的一生中第一次,我意识到有一条叙事线索,当你读这本书时,在第61章之前有一个巨大的危机正在酝酿。因为在以赛亚书的早期部分,我们被告知将会有这位强大的、不可思议的大卫王,一位将要高举旌旗的人。事实上,在以赛亚书11章1到2节中,它说,这位伟大的君王要来,他要高举旌旗,他要荣耀,他要召集列国,他要击败一切邪恶,他要使整个世界恢复正常。它说,耶和华的灵将在他身上成就这事。

这是对诗篇第2篇、以赛亚书第11章的引用。这对我们来说是有道理的。他们说,是的,世界一团糟。我们需要有人来拯救我们。但在以赛亚书的中间部分,从以赛亚书42章开始,

突然间,一个新的角色出现在这些预言中。

这个角色与旧的角色完全不同,与早期章节中的受膏君王完全不同。完全不像受膏的君王,这在文学作品中被称为仆人。在以赛亚书42章、49章、50章和53章中,我们下周会继续讲到。一个新的角色出现了。我们被告知他并不吸引人。

他完全不像那位受膏的征服者。受膏的征服者是荣耀的,我们都渴望他。但这一位,以赛亚书53章告诉我们,他没有美貌。没有可让我们羡慕的美貌。当然,我们被告知那位伟大的受膏征服者将走向胜利。

然而,这个角色却要受苦。这个角色完全不强大。关于这个角色我们被告知了什么?我们被告知他没有可让我们羡慕的美貌,但我们也被告知,他像羊在剪毛的人手下无声,他也是这样不开口。

他被牵去宰杀。他被比作一只小羊羔。他被比作一只母羊羔。他被比作动物王国中最弱小的生物之一。所以这是一个完全不同的人。

那么第一个人呢,为什么以赛亚要这样做?这是怎么回事?这个人是谁?但我们在以赛亚书42章1节中被告知,这个仆人就是那位被圣灵所膏的。这就是为什么当你读到以赛亚书61章1节时,如果你一直在阅读,尤其是用希伯来文阅读——这是他们最初所用的语言——你会突然惊讶得下巴掉到胸口上。

你无法相信,因为到目前为止,你所看到的要么是一个受苦的、温柔的、善良的、牺牲的、丑陋的、被打败的人,要么是这位难以置信的,你知道的,这位征服者,这位强大者,这位荣耀者,这位美丽者。突然间,我们看到他们是同一个人。正如以赛亚书61章所说,这是同一个人,因为他不仅向被掳的人宣告自由,他还医治伤心的人。这位战士是一位护士。这怎么可能是同一个人?

但以赛亚说,这是我的突破。这是我神学上的突破。这是主向我显明的。胜利将是一个

失败。那位强者将会变得无比软弱。

救恩的实现不是靠你鼓起力量来顺服这位伟大的君王。救恩的实现是因为这位伟大的君王将会变得无比软弱,遭受苦难、被击败并死去。有人会说,怎么可能?为什么会这样?我不明白。

答案就在第三节,用三个小词——代替。用三个小词代替。经文说,我要为锡安悲哀的人预备,赐给他们华冠代替灰尘,喜乐油代替悲哀,赞美衣代替忧伤之灵。这个翻译还不错,基本表达了意思。

但基本上,我们被告知的是,弥赛亚不只是简单地说,你有灰尘,让我把华冠放在你的灰尘上面,对吧?他不是说,你有悲哀,但让我,让我把油涂在你身上。不,他是在说,我把我所拥有的给你。你把你所拥有的给我。

我们在这里看到的是代替的原则。突然间,我们意识到为什么他不美丽。他为什么不美丽?因为我们得到了他的美丽。他得到了我们的灰尘。

我们为什么喜乐?因为他得到了他的喜乐。他得到了我们的绝望。这就是为什么在十字架上,他呼喊道,我的神,我的神,为什么离弃我?我是说,那就是绝望。

我们得到了他的绝望。不对,是他得到了我们的绝望。你看到了吗?这意味着他必须如此无比强大。

你不明白吗?如果你是一只羊羔面对剪羊毛的人,或者适应剪羊毛的人。如果你是一只羊羔面对那些要杀你的人,以某种镇定姿态来面对,这是一回事。但当你不是羊羔却要成为羊羔,这是另一回事。如果你本来就丑陋,与之共存,这是一回事。

但如果你美丽,却自愿变得丑陋,好让别人能够美丽,这是另一回事。你看到这里发生了什么吗?看哪,他自愿丑陋的美丽。看哪,他自愿软弱的力量。

他必须那么强大。如果他能够的话,他必须是第一个形象才能成为第二个形象。当然,成为

第二个人物,他不是某种东西,而是他不得不做的事情。他为我们做了这件事。因此,是替代。

耶稣基督来到世上时,能够处理罪的烈火,因为他个人必须经历罪的破坏性的每一个方面。他身体上破碎了。这就是为什么他得到炉灰。他心理上破碎了。这就是为什么他得到悲哀。

他灵性上破碎了,因为父神与他隔绝。他说,我的神,我的神,为什么离弃我?所以他得到忧伤的灵。现在,这对我们实际上意味着什么?让我们来谈谈这个。让我们列个小清单。

我们应该如何回应?第一,请信靠他。现在,我要说的是。首先是,看第11节,土壤是生长树苗的东西。你看到了吗?

如果我拿起一颗橡子,握在手里,我可以带着它走很多年很多年。你知道会发生什么吗?什么都不会发生。为什么?因为是土壤赋予橡子生长的力量,或者至少打开橡子中生长的力量。

是土壤。是养分。是水分。如果我只是握着它,一直带着它到处走。什么都不会发生。

第11节说,土壤最终会把我们从炉灰中转变,你知道,没有土壤,橡子最终会变成灰烬。如果我只是带着它,最终它会散掉。它必须被种植。所以我们被告知的是主的主权。那个词"至高的主"是相当不寻常的。

至高意味着王的王权。这就是你的灵魂可以成长的土壤。顺服他。现在你看,如果我们只知道他是以赛亚书前半部分的王,而不是以赛亚书后半部分的王,我知道你无法承受,但我们很多人无论如何都无法承受。让我说实话。

你们很多人说,我想从神那里得到一些东西。我害怕说我顺服。我害怕说我降服。我只是害怕。我知道为什么,因为你心里有一部分说,如果我真的,真的对神说,你说什么,我就做什么,你差遣什么,我就接受什么。

看,那就是顺服。那就是埋进土壤。那就是把你的

灵魂置于他的主权之下。意思是说,无论你告诉我什么,无论我对此有何感受,我都会去做。无论实际上看起来如何,我都会去做。

然后无论你差遣我什么,我都会接受。这就是把自己置于土壤之下。我们被告知,你的灵魂需要的是他的王权。除非这发生,否则你永远不会成长。火焰永远不会开始被调低。

除非这发生,炉火才会被调低。你知道吗,你们很多人在说,我害怕那样做。当然,他可能会让我做一些我不想做的事。当然,亚伯拉罕不想把以撒带上山。耶稣不想去十字架。

我不是说他不会要求你做你不想做的事。当然,他会这样做。但除非耶稣说的那样,除非种子落在地里死了,它就不能结出果实。具有讽刺意味的是,种子可以死在地下。然后它就会成为伟大而美丽的东西。

它可以死在地上,但无论如何它都会死,你也会以某种方式死去。你可以做自己的主人和自己的主宰。然后你会化为灰烬,或者你可以向自己的意志死去。你可以不再按自己的方式过自己的生活。你想要进入地下吗?

我会做你说的任何事。无论我看到你的旨意是什么,无论如何我都会去做。无论你差遣我什么,我都会接受。第1节说,王的主权。你可以信靠他。

第11节说,王的主权。它会使你成长,但整段经文都在说,但这位王为你进入地下。这位王为你失去了一切。想想你,你可能会放弃什么?如果你真的说,我要完全将自己献给耶稣基督。

当然你会放弃一些东西。你认为你会放弃的东西能比得上他所放弃的吗?他说,如果你放弃这些东西,你将要放弃的就只是这些,如果你放弃你的权利,你就会放弃你的绝望。如果你放弃你的权利,你就会放弃你的灰烬。我取走了你的灰烬。

你从我这里将只会得到美丽。我取走了你的早晨。你从我这里将只会得到喜乐。难道你不

看到了吗?这是第一件事。

这位战士是一位护士。降卑下来。这是第一件事。第二件事。非常重要。

除非你看到祂既是受苦的仆人又是伟大的主,你就无法成为基督徒。你知道为什么吗?你看,如果你只是把祂当作这位伟大的主,想着我要顺服。我就是要顺服。那不是使你成为基督徒的。

使你成为基督徒的是第10节。这是以赛亚开始说话。以赛亚实际上给了我们预言。是弥赛亚在说话。是耶稣基督在说话。

但当你读到第8节和第9节时,突然你会看到,看啊。突然以赛亚开始说话。他开始谈论这个,以下是以赛亚所说的。祂给我穿上。事实上,我偏离了NIV的翻译。

祂用公义的袍子包裹我。成为基督徒意味着什么?它意味着不是说,我足够强大,我可以跟随这位君王。我会顺服。然后我会得到祂的祝福。

哦不,不。我们必须看到这一点。祂比那更强大。祂比那更强大。我们不只是有一位来说跟从我的君王。

我们有一位首先来说,我要去死的君王。我要成为你需要成为的一切。我要代替你。所以我不是要求你获得公义。我要把公义赐给你。

我要把它种在你的心里。我要用它包裹你的身体和灵魂。你会得到我的公义,我的喜乐,看到了吗?我的美好。那就是你将得到的。

所以你不是基督徒,如果你说,我从现在开始要努力过一个好的生活。顺便说一句,那不是真正的死。你可能会想,哦,我不再是我自己的主了,但你是你自己的救主。如果你是你自己的救主,你就是你自己的主。你必须愿意说,我放弃我对自己生命的权利,因为除了让我之外,你已经为我做了一切。

哦,父啊,因为耶稣所做的。这会使你成为基督徒。你必须把这两者放在一起,否则你无法成为基督徒。第三,基督徒朋友们,除非你看到祂既是征服的英雄,受膏的征服者,又是受苦的仆人。你不会

理解实际上甚至他在你自己的生活中对待你的方式。

这是我知道的一件事。有时候我做了一些非常愚蠢的事情,神就让我摆脱困境。他只是,你知道,我说,我做了一些非常愚蠢的事情。请帮助我。然后不知怎么的,他保护了我。

他就这样放过了,好吗?所以有时候只是一些真的很愚蠢的事情,然后一切都很好。而其他时候我只是做了一点点小小的愚蠢的事情。然后就是砰、砰、砰、砰。你说,主啊,再打我一次。

我还在呼吸。这是为什么呢?我永远不会忘记当我听迪克·卢卡斯关于约翰福音11章的磁带时,耶稣来到拉撒路的坟墓,两个姐妹出来见他。你记得这个吗?马大来说,如果你在这里,我的兄弟拉撒路就不会死了。

好的。然后大约三节经文之后,马利亚来到他面前,另一个姐妹说,如果我的兄弟,如果你在这里,我的兄弟拉撒路就不会死了。如果你仔细看,这是同样的话。这是同一个地点。这是同样的情况。

这是同样的状况。我的天哪。这是两个名字都以MA开头的女人。我的意思是,一切都是一样的。那么在第一种情况下,耶稣做了什么?

他对马大说,马大,我就是复活和生命。这真的是当面说的。我知道当我们读到它时,我们听到的是,我就是复活和生命。凡是,你知道,是的,但看看上下文。他有点,他在这样对待马大。

他真的是在说,马大,我就是复活和生命。如果我在这里,当我在这里的时候,你就活着。无论什么时候都无所谓。他说,我就是复活和生命。所以他在某种程度上是在面对她。

但是当马利亚上来,说同样的问题,做同样的陈述,对不起,以同样的方式来质问他。他做了什么?你还记得吗?他只是哭了。看,第一次他给予真理的服事,第二次他给予眼泪的服事,一次他只是有点严厉,另一次他只是倾听。

现在,你知道为什么吗?因为这位战士是一位护士。他是奇妙的策士。你和我,任何,每个,你们有些人是辅导员,不是吗?你们并不完美。

我知道。我试过了

很难成为一个完美的辅导者。问题就在这里。有时候我真正需要做的只是倾听、耐心并握着他们的手，但我却去责备他们，结果就不好了。他们真正需要的是被倾听。

而另一些时候，我倾听、倾听、倾听、倾听，但我本应该责备他们。我的意思是，我倾向于在应该倾听的时候责备。我在应该责备的时候倾听。有时候我在应该只是施行眼泪的事工时，却施行了真理的事工。另一些时候，我在真正应该施行真理的事工时，却施行了眼泪的事工。

但耶稣总是恰到好处。这也是为什么他在你看来似乎像个精神分裂症患者的唯一原因。因为他准确地知道你需要什么，以及你什么时候需要它。有些时候，出于某种原因，他就是进来，托起这艘船，带着你一路向前。而另一些时候，他似乎完全抛弃了你。

为什么？他是完美的辅导者。他既是战士又是护士。他会为你换便盆。他也会打你的嘴巴。

你看，护士通常不能这样做，或者他们不想这样做。他们不是那种人。而战士，显然，也不能换便盆。他们不是那种人。但我们的救主是奇妙的策士。

你看，奇妙的策士、全能的神、永恒的父、和平的君，全部都是。第四点。当耶稣基督宣讲这段经文时，他说，听着，他读到这节经文的中间，然后说，主悦纳人的禧年。换句话说，当耶稣基督宣讲这段经文时，他站起来说，主的灵在我身上，对吗？因为主膏我传好信息给贫穷的人。

他差遣我医治伤心的人，宣告被掳的得释放，被囚的出监牢，宣告主悦纳人的禧年。然后他就在这句话的中间、这节经文的中间停了下来。他坐下来说，今天就应验了。那么，他为什么不继续读这段经文的其余部分呢？他为什么不继续说，还有我们神报仇的日子呢？

耶稣怎么了？还有

答案就在这里。很明显，它们不是同一回事。报仇的日子要来了。审判的日子要来了。

但很有意思的是，以赛亚书中的弥赛亚在这里说，我来是要宣告主悦纳人的禧年和报仇的日子。这意味着有一段时期被称为禧年。但最终它会结束，那将是审判的日子。这其实就是耶稣所说的。耶稣说的不是抓住今天（seize the day）。

耶稣是在说，基督徒要抓住这一年（seize the year）。这是什么意思呢？这意味着从现在开始，从我的第一次降临到我的第二次降临，我要你们按照禧年的原则生活。从我们所能了解的来看，当耶稣基督第一次宣讲这个信息时，他确实说了，我来是要宣告禧年，但没有迹象表明他试图在以色列建立一个社会计划。他没有说，看，我们必须回到过去，每个人都必须收回他们的旧土地，但他没有这样做。

另一方面，他没有这样做。另一方面，认为他仅仅是在属灵意义上谈论这件事是愚蠢的。经文不是这样的，利未记25章不是那样的。这是我的最佳答案。一位名叫赖特（N.T. Wright）的新约学者在他的一本书中有一段很好的论述。

他说，耶稣基督呼召基督徒在基督的第一次和第二次降临之间，按照禧年的原则生活。这意味着耶稣来了，他说，我的神的国度，我的国度部分地在这里，但还没有完全实现。我要你们开始牺牲。我要你们彼此之间极其慷慨。我要你们彼此免除债务。

我要你们创建一个群体，在这个群体中，人们真正为穷人付出自己。我要你们成为一个群体，在这个群体中，你们真正为心碎的人付出自己。我要你们说，因为你为我所做的，我现在要努力在各个方面医治人们。我要努力在属灵上把他们带到基督面前。我要努力把他们聚集在一起，在心理上医治他们。

我要努力在社会和经济上提升他们。如果

他们是贫穷的，我要尽我所能。这是否意味着我将不得不花钱？我将要把我的很多钱捐出去。这是否意味着我要参与到人们的生活中？

是的。耶稣并不是说基督徒要掌权并把禧年作为一项计划。但那并不奏效。那不是重点。这并不意味着基督徒不应该在整体社会中为公义而努力。

是的。但他所说的是，让我们不要逃避这个责任。基督徒们，现在是救赎主。你们现在就开始按照禧年的原则生活。这意味着在属灵上彼此饶恕，也意味着在各个方面对彼此慷慨得令人难以置信。

把彼此带进彼此的家中。
