# Keller CUV Rewrite Standard

## Alignment
- Sentence order must match English.
- Avoid compressing multiple English sentences into a single Chinese sentence.
- Keep fillers/hedges when meaningful (e.g., “you know,” “in fact”) but don’t over-literalize to awkward Chinese.

## Scripture replacement
- If verse reference is explicit (John 3:16, Romans 8:32), replace with exact CUV (CUS) verse text.
- If no explicit reference, translate naturally; do not invent a verse citation.

## Formatting
- Preserve paragraph breaks.
- No headings inserted into chunks.
- Keep punctuation consistent with modern Chinese.
