## English Transcript / 英文原文

the teaching is based, it's  read it together, Luke chapter 6 verses 27 to 38. But I tell you who hear me, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those  who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also. If someone takes your cloak, do not stop him from taking your tunic. If someone gives to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do  not demand it back, due to others as you would have them, due to you.

If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them, and if you do good to those who are good to you,  what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that, and if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit  is that to you? Even sinners, lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full. But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend them without expecting to get anything  back, and then your reward will be great.

And you will be sons of the most high, because he is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked. Be merciful just as your father is merciful. Do not judge, and you won't be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.

Given it will be given to you. A good measure, press down, shaken together, running over, will be poured into your lap. For with a measure you use, it will be measured to you. This is God's Word. We are looking at the sermon on the mount, because this is one of the best places to find  out what concretely Christianity looks like when it is lived out.

What does it mean to actually live a Christian life? And one of the problems with the sermon on the mount is that there are so many great trees  that you miss the forest. Now the trees are the individual subjects. In the sermon on the mount, we get into certain, very important and very hot, ethical subjects. So we get into guidelines for money, for sex, for relationships, honesty, promises,  you get into all these things.

Very interesting. But because it is so interesting, you can often miss the context. And what we did was before Easter, we spent two Sundays working on the context. There's two very basic principles. Things you've got to keep in mind all the time when you're reading.

Otherwise you're going to miss the forest for the trees. Now what are those two principles? And I want to lay them out right away because it's easy to forget. It's been three weeks, two weeks ago. First of all, the sermon on the well given to you together.

First of all, the sermon on the mount must not be read individually or moralistically. Now by individualistically we mean this. The sermon on the mount talks about how to conduct our relationships, how to treat our  attitude toward our money, and so on. And in our society, because we live in an individualistic, privatized society, most of  you are going to sit down and say, good, this will give me guidelines for making personal  decisions on things. And it will, of course.

But what the sermon on the mount is really about is about a kingdom, remember? We talked about that three weeks ago. A God's kingdom on earth. In other words, the sermon on the mount is talking about an alternate community. It's talking about what a community would look like that's ruled not by the world's  values of power and success, and acclaim, and approval, and appearance, but by the kingdom  of God's values, a sacrifice and service.

And so what it's really doing here is it's showing us a community, an alternate society  in which people get together as Christians, we say we're going to live in this way. And so it's a way to show the world what business practices would look like, what race relationships  would look like, what our family life would look like, what our psychological life would  look like, our friendships. And therefore you can't get the grace of the sermon on the mount by just coming to church  even every Sunday, getting inspiration going home and saying, now I know how to live my  life. You've got to be part of the community. Now, let me put it this way, who's got your number?

Who are you accountable to? In Hebrews 3 it says, exhort one another daily, less your heart get hard. Now I want to ask you a question, who is exhorting a daily to keep your heart soft? Who is exhorting you as a Christian? Who are you talking to, for example, who are you talking to as a Christian about how much  money to spend on yourself and how much money to give away?

You say, as a typical Western individualist to person, you say, how I spend my money  as my business. In other words, you're not part of a community. You're not part of a counter-culture. You're not part of the thing that the servant on the mount is talking about. The servant on the mount is calling us to be part of a community and until you are part  of a community, not just visiting church on Sunday, even every Sunday, but part of  a community of people who are saying, we're going to live this out together.

You cannot obey, then you're not obeying the servant on the mount. So we can't read it individually. I've got to say that every so often. The second thing, and this will be even more brief because it comes out as the servant  goes on, we must not read the servant on the mount moralistically, which means when  you read an ECG's saying, here's how I want you to live. It is natural for people to say, aha, this is how I can please God.

This is how I can reach God. I'm going to live like this. Then God will bless me. Then God will give me his salvation. Then God will give me his grace.

Now listen. He said religion, things like that, Christianity doesn't. Religion is outside in. If I do all these things on the outside, God will give me his grace in here. Christianity is inside out.

Christianity says only when I already have his blessing, already have his grace, already  have a new heart, already have that change, will I be able to live out in this way. The servant on the mount assumes the new heart. It assumes the grace, the blessing. It doesn't say, here's how to get it. It assumes you've already got it and you say, well, how can that be?

The whole point of the servant on the mount is to say, religion can never produce this  kind of life. Can you say, how can that be? Well, that will be seen as we go. So we mustn't read it individualistically, and we mustn't read it moralistically. That's the farest.

Now, let's get to the first tree because we're going to do this for the rest of the  spring, all the way to June. The first tree is relationships. What we have here in this very famous passage that we just read, there's another version  of it in Matthew 5, but it's a lot longer than the other place where we have the servant  on the mount. There's a shorter version of it, and therefore, I pull it out because it fits the page,  see? It's on the page.

Now, and Matthew 5 did not. Much of the other reasons. So relationships, that's the first subject. Now, as soon as you hear the word relationships, right away you say, ah, relationships, you're  thinking of friendship, or love and marriage and romance. And of course, everything in here absolutely applies, especially to marriage.

Love your enemies. Do good to those who curse you. Okay? In other words, and you know what, I can't even get back to this as funny as that is, as  funny as that is, if this is the behavior that God demands, that we take with people  who are hostile to us, it's obvious that he expects us to give it in our friendships  and in our marriages. We can't expect that God expects us to do less for people that we are close to than people  in our neighborhood.

However, the main purpose of this passage is not to talk about friendships and love relationships. The main purpose is to talk about our relationships to other people outside of our friendships as  a matter of fact. And therefore, if you look through here, you'll see Jesus right away starts off with three  cases. He's talking about three kinds, three groups of people right away, and he tells us what  behavior he expects. Now, let's look and see what he's calling for.

And then we'll immediately be shocked, upset, and then we'll have to say, okay, how can  we do it? Now, the first thing, the first group of people is people who oppose you. People who are against you, people who have wronged you. And that's why we see love your enemies, those who hate you, those who curse you, hating  and curse you means they will you ill. And then those who mistreat you and those who struck you on the cheek, those are people  who have done you ill.

And Jesus says, I want you to love them, I want you to care for them, I want you to pray  for them, I want you to pull for them. And I want you to as much as possible be good to them. That's the first group. The second group are people not who have wronged you, but people less fortunate than you. Now you see, if you read this, there's a tendency when it says, if someone takes your cloak,  do you not stop them from taking your tunic?

And there's a tendency to stick that sentence with what came before, in which case it looks  like it's saying, when someone robs you, say, oh, by the way, here's my safe behind this  picture. But what it's saying, because this sentence actually goes grammatically and logically  with what comes after, give to everyone who asks you. And if anyone takes what belongs, you don't demand it back to others as you would have  them do to you. Now you see this dude others as you have to do to you. If we're talking about robbery here, that doesn't fit, does it?

It sounds like it's saying, well, when you're robbing somebody, how would you want to be treated? No, that's not what it's saying. It couldn't be saying that. And rather, the word take and ask are synonyms, just like, you see, hate and curse and mistreat  are synonyms. And what it's saying is, when someone comes, and they say, I'm in need, you're supposed  to be promiscuously generous, Earl Ellis, who wrote a wonderful commentary, I'm going  to quote him a couple times, wrote a great commentary on the book of Luke.

This is what he says about this passage. He says, this right here where it says, ask, anyone who asks of you give, not just your  cook but your tunic. He says, Christ is not here advocating perfunctory or even large gifts to the poor. Get this. He enjoins a moral concern that will express itself in a spirit of self-denial in every encounter  of life.

And that will do, and will do this for the sake of the kingdom of God. He says, a spirit of self-denial that is part of every encounter in life. Now here's what that means. It means you are so concerned for people who have less than you. But you don't even go out and buy a chair without thinking about them.

You say, OK, I'm going to go buy a chair, but I've got to make sure I buy a chair in  such a way that I have money to give away. I mean, it's going to affect everything, not just your outer coat, but your tunic. It's a way of saying that every single part of your life be oriented toward promiscuous  generosity. You're never not thinking about it. It's not enough to say, well, you know, every time somebody comes and takes an offering  or somebody asks to give it to the office, I'm pretty generous.

This is much, much more extensive than that. So first of all, you have people who have wronged you. Secondly, you have people who have less than you, who have a more less fortunate you. But here's the last one. It's more subtle.

Thirdly, people who are indifferent and different. Now, if you look at the rest of this, it says, if you love those who love you, if you  love those who can be good to you, if you love those who can repay you, now, what is  he talking about? And then he says, even sinners, now, here's what he's talking about. Think about it for a minute, especially when he gets to the bottom. He says, I want you to be kind to the ungrateful and the wicked, see that?

That's who's in that paragraph. Now, let me put it like this. Everybody's like this. Let's say you're a member of a political party, whether you're conservative or liberal. Maybe if you're in the middle, this doesn't count because you don't consider yourself  part of a party, a certain political outlook.

But let's say you have a racial. If you're Anglo, it doesn't mean you may be not in a dominant society where Anglo is  your dominant. It may not be quite as conscious of your race. But if you are African-American or Latin, Latino, or Asian-American, you're more conscious  of race, no matter who you are, there's a tendency to see another group of people. Over there, and it's not your group.

And at the very, very best, you don't respect them very much. And at the very, very worst, you think that they're the problem in society. At the very best, you don't respect them. At the very worst, you think they're the problem in society. Now, you will probably think, but I know some of these people.

I'm friendly with them. Some of them are kind of friends with me. I see them at the office, or I see them at work, or they're that sort of thing. Or I went to school with some of them. I know some of them, however, they are, basically, they're different.

They're not like you. And you actually think of them as sort of kind of strange in many ways, or even people  that you really just don't respect. Now, you may be civil to them, but you don't do for them. You don't do good. You don't lay yourself out.

You don't open your heart home. You don't open your purse. You don't open your heart. You don't open your life. You hang with the people who are like you.

The people you respect. And Jesus comes along and says, of course, everybody's like that. That's the gist of his point in here. Absolutely, everybody's like that. He's talking to people.

And when he uses the word sinners here, you see the word sinners? Why is it in quotations? Why is it in quotes? Jesus never uses the word sinners, except in quotes, usually. Here's why.

Remember, like in Luke 15, when the Pharisees come and say, he eats with sinners. And see, they mean by sinners, irreligious, immoral people, prostitutes, tax collectors,  Roman collaborators, stuff like that. And Jesus doesn't use the word that way. He doesn't divide the world into sinners and the nice religious people. So it must mean he's talking to the kind of people who use the word like that.

And what he's saying to them is absolutely everybody on the surface, you say, I'm religious  and they're not, but absolutely everybody does is what do they do? You walk into a room and you look around at the other people in the room and you say,  are these my kind of people? Do I want to be here? Do I want to associate with them? Do they make me feel more about myself like I want to feel?

Now, Jesus is saying, everybody does it. Now let's just say you're a worldly person. Well, what you're going to do is you're going to walk into the room and you're going to  look around and you see people that look less cool, less savvy, less accomplished than  you, people that, you know, you tried real hard to keep yourself in shape and dress nicely  and these people look kind of like slabs and, you know, you'll put up with them for  a while. You're not going to open up. These people do not make you feel about yourself the way you want to feel.

You go into these rooms and you say, are these the kind of people that will move me up socially  to be accepted by the people that want to be accepted by and will these people move  me up psychologically so that I feel about myself the way I want to feel about myself. And if these people aren't as cool as you think you might be at least, at least try to  be, if they're not as, if they're not as acclaimed, if they're not as pulled together, if they're  not as accomplished, if they're not as good looking, then you just find your way out of that  room. And here was, what Jesus is saying is, okay, but what about religious people? Are they different? No.

Religious people come on in and they look around and religious people need to feel that they're  pretty good because all religious people deeply need the assurance that they're good. Why? Because they're basic, they're, they're whole identity on the idea, I'm a good person. If I live a good enough life, if I obey the similar amount, if I do all the things right,  then God will love me. But you never know you're good enough.

So you desperately need assurance that you are. So when you walk in, you look at people and you say, are these, are these my kind of  people? Are these upright decent people? Are these people that will help me get accepted by the people I need to feel accepted  by if I'm going to feel okay about myself? Are these the kind of people that make me feel like I'm a decent person that I have the  right ideas, that I have the right beliefs, that I have the right doctrines, that I have  the right practices?

Jesus says, you're all the same. And he says, however, therefore Jesus is not contrasting two ways, he's contrasting  three ways. He's saying, here's how sinners do it, here's how religious people do it, and Christians  have to be different than both. He says, I know everybody respects civilly. I mean, they show respect to the people whose beliefs differ with theirs, people that they  don't respect much, people who are other, but you're going to be different.

Jesus' Christians are going to give, they're going to do good, they're going to lend, they're  going to open their hearts, they're going to open their lives, they're going to deliberately  look for opportunities as much as possible to do for people who are very different from  you, the kind of things that everybody else only does for their own kind. And therefore Jesus is saying, here's how you treat enemies, love and forgiveness. Here's how you treat people who are less fortunate than you, and here's how you treat people  who are different and indifferent to you, the people that you consider ungrateful and  wicked. And Jesus says, that's how I want you to live. Now let's stop for one second.

Most religions have a lot of ethics to go on these lines, but everybody agrees that at  this point Jesus has broken through his burst the banks. When he starts to say, love your enemies. When he starts to say, live lives of promiscuous generosity. And when he says, I want you to alone amongst the face of the earth, be people who are deliberately  able to with love and without any disrespect, share and serve people who are utterly different  than you. In fact he goes this far, in a sense what he's doing in here is he's saying, the mark that  you're a Christian, the thing that differentiates a Christian from people who are both religious  and irreligious is their attitude toward people who are deeply different than they are.

Do you act superior to them? Or the people who are come against you, do you pay them back, or do you forgive them and  serve them without superiority? Jesus, that's how we know that you belong to me. Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer, or are you hoping to help new  believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith? For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding  of what it means to follow Christ.

A great resource to start using this summer is the new city catechism devotional, God's  truth for our hearts and minds. This devotional brings the historic catechisms of the Christian Church to life, offering  a question to consider for each week of the year. In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catechesis, the rich and communal  practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers that frame the foundational beliefs  of the Christian faith. Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer, and a brief meditation that will challenge  and inspire you. The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller, and  Kevin D.

Young, as well as historical figures such as Augustine, John Calvin, and Martin  Luther. This month, in addition to the new city catechism devotional, we are including a great  companion resource, the new city catechism for kids, as our thank you for your gift to  help gospel and life share the hope of Christ's love with people all over the world. So request your copies today at gospelonlife.com slash give. That's gospelonlife.com slash give. Now here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching.

I'll write away people say, first of all, A, I can't do it, and B, if I did, I think  it sounds like suicide, right? People say it's impossible for me inside, and even if it was possible, it seems like,  you know, it would be suicidal. Well, listen briefly, but there's an awful lot of stuff packed into this passage. Briefly, there's three things that Jesus says, almost as if he knows people are going  to say that. He says, let me tell you what the difficulty is, and let me tell you what inner dynamic  you need to have, and then let me give you some directions, difference, difficulty, dynamic  and directions, and here's what they are.

First of all, he says, here's what the basic, basic difficulty is. Three times, he says, if you love only those who love you, what credit is that, or he  says, if you love, if you only do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that? And then three times, he says, what credit is that? Now, that's a hard thing to, if you read that, it's kind of vague. It's a little ambiguous.

What does it mean? What credit is that? Credit with who? And the NIV, the translation we have there, is trying to be ambiguous, and it ought to  be ambiguous, because it's a very, very interesting and pregnant and multi, I think basically,  multi-dimensional thing. Jesus is actually saying, literally, I'll tell you what he's saying.

He says, if you love those who love you, and he says, what grace? This is there in that. Because the word that's translated credit is the New Testament word for grace, caress. It's the New Testament word that means unmerited love. And when he says, if you only love those who love you, where's the unmerited love in  that?

Well, now that's a little weird, but here's what he's saying. Number one, he's saying, when you love your own kind, and not others, when you love people  who are giving you some kind of emotional payoff or some kind of social payoff, that they're  helping you socially, or they're helping you in your self-esteem, whenever you, you know,  I mean, you've got to be careful. Think about this. Religious people look like they're kind of working with draining people, and they're  working with needy people, you know, they look like it very often, but why? Why are you doing it?

Are you not doing it so that you can say, I know God loves me, because look at the kind  of person I am. In that case, you see, Jesus is saying, when you only love people for a payoff, it's  not really that you don't love well enough, you're not loving it all. Jesus is saying, don't look at my standard and say, well, I love people, but not like that. Jesus says, if you love people because of what they profit you, you're not loving them  at all, you're loving what they give you, you're loving your own ego, and you're using  them to fulfill it. You're not loving them for their sakes.

You're loving them for your sake. You're not loving it all. There's no loving at all. Here's Person A, and here's Person B, and Person A is cool, and Person B is a slob and  kind of draining, and you love this one, much more than you love that one, why? You know, it has nothing to do with them, has everything to do with you, it's not about  them.

My goodness, you can be attracted, you can have a crush on this person, and it's not  about them. It's about you, boy, the person who looks like this, and of a person who is this kind of  position in society, and of a person who's got looks like this, if they like me back,  then I'll know I'm somebody. And Jesus is saying, there's no love here at all, because what you're doing is you're  loving on the basis of their merits with regard to your self-esteem. So first of all he's saying, your love isn't love, but then secondly he's saying, and  here's the reason you are indeficent. If you only love those who love you, where's the love in you, and what he means is simply  this.

Think of an investment banker, you know, some of you are, all right, now let's just say  you are just rolling at it, not just saying, you know, and you're personally wealthy, and  you're just absolutely rolling at it, you're an investor, let's not say you're an investment  banker, you're an investor, and you're just rolling at it, and you know, you have a  number of opportunities that come before you. If you're just rolling at it, you know what? You can look at a product and say, I like this new business, I'll capitalize it, why? Because I like the product, because I think it's good for people, because I like the attitude  of the entrepreneur, right? Even though I don't know if it's going to work, but I like that, so I'm going to do it.

Okay, but what if you're an investor sucking air? What if you're an investor in a lot of trouble? What if you're an investor saying, man, I've got to make a major profit on the next  investment, then I'm sorry, you're only going to put your money, not whether it's a good  product, not whether you like the entrepreneur, you've got to put it wherever you're going  to get a payoff. Now, Jesus Christ is saying, everybody on the face of the earth is an investor sucking  air when it comes to love. You are not sure about who you are, you are not sure of yourself, that's the reason why  you make such distinctions in who you love and who you go out with.

And I would say, I'm talking about friendship, man, I'm talking about romance, but I'm  also just talking about who you associate with, who you sit down with, who you spend time  with, how much time and how much heart you put into a conversation on the street is all  going to have to do, Jesus says, with what's happening in your heart. And he says, because you're in deficit, you're not loving it all, you're investing in  anybody that can give you the payoff you need. And that's the problem, because that inner love deficit, that inner grace deficit,  you're going to have to experience unmerited love, you're going to have to experience an  ocean of unmerited love, if you're going to be able to give it. So that's the difficulty. So what's the dynamic?

The dynamic is right here at the very end, now take a quick close look. First of all, and I'm going to read you what Earl Ellis says, first of all, Jesus says,  then your reward would be great and you'll be sons of the most high because he is kind  to the ungrateful and the wicked. If you can get ahold of that verse, if you believe it, you know it, you understand it,  you're taking the center of your life, you'll have the dynamic that will enable you to begin  to move out and do what Jesus Christ is saying. You'll want to do it, you'll actually be able to take steps. If you don't believe that verse, if you don't understand what's in it, then everything  Jesus calls you to is at best impossible and at worst dangerous rubbish.

But what if you understand what's in there or what's in there, two things? First of all, excuse me, it she knows, okay? Please go away. The first thing it says is your sons of the father. Earl Ellis in his commentary on Luke says, you have to be very careful because it looks  the way the English translation comes out, doesn't it?

It looks like if I give love, then I'll become a son of God, right? It says, then you will be. It sounds like, then you will become, but that's not what the Greek sense is at all. This is what he says. He says, this is spoken to disciples for whom God is already your father.

What Jesus is doing here is inviting his disciples to actualize in their ethic the meaning  of their relationship. They are called to be what you are. Now what this means is a Christian has to understand that I'm adopted. What is adoption? Now John chapter 1 verse 12, Paul and Galatians 4 says, even though everybody is a  creation of God and therefore loved and valued by God, it is an act of grace when we are  adopted.

Now to be adopted means something very important and in those days, if an heir was, let's  just say, a wealthy person, a wealthy man or woman had no children, what was very normal  for them to do is they would take some other adult and they would adopt them and then  that person would become their heir and what would happen at the moment of adoption and  that's the background to everything the New Testament understands about our relationship  with God. Adoption, first of all, it's a legal grace because you might be penniless, but the second  that the seal is put on your adoption papers suddenly, even though you haven't done anything  to work for it, suddenly, automatically, you're rich. By grace, legally, by standing in an instant, but the second thing is you don't just have  this wealth. You have a new intimacy, suddenly this great person is no longer your CEO, no longer your  prime minister, this person is your father and that means you have intimacy with him,  it means your relationship is permanent, a father's love for a child gets stronger when  it does wrong. You also have accessibility, don't call the CEO or don't call the prime minister up  at 2 a.m. to ask for a glass of water, that won't be considered right, but a son or  a daughter can ask.

And so suddenly, now that is assumed here, do you understand that relationship? Do you understand that the Lord of heaven and earth is your father that you've been adopted  by grace? In spite of everything you are, you're rich in him, you're loved permanently, you are  loved unconditionally, you are loved comprehensively, that's an assumption. I can't go into all that now, I'm not going to go into all that now, this passage doesn't  explain adoption, it assumes it and you have to understand that that's the first point. The first thing you have to understand to get that dynamic is are you adopted, do you understand  what that means?

Is that the greatest thing about you? Is that really the source of everything? But then secondly, it says for he is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked. Now you see, the ungrateful and the wicked is a parallel with everything that's been  going up. In other words, Jesus is saying here, I want you to be like your father because he has  been gracious to his enemies, he's been gracious to his enemies, and who are those enemies?

Wow, us, and this is the dynamite, and I tell you, if you can light this dynamite, you  can light the fuse on this and here's how you do it, a Christian understands him or herself  to be an adopted enemy, an adopted enemy, two things, on the one hand you were an enemy,  now neither religious nor irreligious people believe their enemies of God, and I don't have  the time and this isn't the place, because this passage doesn't go into it. For me to explain all of how that operates, but here's the way, religious people never  think of themselves as enemies of God, they say I'm trying so hard, I'm trying very hard  to be like God, I'm trying to do it all, and irreligious people say, well I'm indifferent  or I have trouble believing, but they don't consider themselves enemies of God, and one  of the ways you know that you're a Christian, that the basis for your relationship with God  is on grace, and not by your performance and your achievement and your good works, is  that you've come to understand that you are an enemy, that means that you have just  you have resented his claim on your every centimeter of your life, and you have even  come to see that even your efforts to be good have really been ways of trying to get control  of a God and get him to have to do things for you, and a Christian is somebody who says  I'm an enemy, but I'm adopted, and when you put those two things together, everything  that's in here flows out, why, where do you see, where do you say, well that's interesting  conceptually, all right, you have to melt your heart with it, where do you see God really  being kind of the ungrateful and the wicked on the cross, because on the cross you see  him cursed, but he's blessing, on the cross you see him mistreated, but he's praying,  just like Jesus is not saying, Jesus is not just simply saying, be like this, and he's  not just simply saying, be like this because I'm like this, he's saying, be like this  because I am going to be like this for you, and when that happens, when you see that,  in other words, when you see him loving you, and let me ask you a question, what did  loving you do for Jesus' social standing? Jesus didn't just get nothing out of you,  he went infinitely down, he came from heaven to earth, as the song goes, he came from  earth to the grave. He went all the way down, let me ask another question, what did Jesus  Christ get out of you, not socially, but psychologically, what did he do for his self-esteem? He made him to be sin who knew no sin.

Look, here is Jesus Christ who looks at you and  loves you for you, not only did he get nothing out of you, he got exactly the opposite  of what you seek to get out of your relationships, unless you see that on the one hand, you were  so lost, he had to die for you, on the other hand, you were so loved that he had to die for  you. And when you take that in and you see him doing that, you will have finally the  answer to the love deficit, the unmerited love deficit, and you will look out there  and you'll see people and you'll say no matter how broken they are, I was broken, no  matter how mistaken they are, look at all their wrong views, I was mistaken. Even though they're  even other hostile to you, I was hostile to him while he was doing it. I was upset as he was  reaching out to me, we were jeering Adam in a sense, humankind was jeering Adam while he was dying  for us, and you'll never be the same again when that gets all your heart. And then what happens  is here's the directions, then what difference does that actually make?

Two things. First of all,  turn the other cheek, and then forgive. Or you say turn the other cheek, that's the problem,  that seems very, very impractical, oh really, now think about it for a second. First of all,  look at verse 27-28, these are very famous places. Love your enemy, pray for those, pull for them,  turn the other cheek.

Well, it sounds like it's saying, you just walk all over me, that's all right,  hit me again, I'm still breathing. Listen, first of all, look at the word butt. What's the word  butt, therefore? It's a contrast. Well, what came before it?

Well, we read it three weeks ago,  Jesus Christ in the beginning of Luke, this is the Luke version. Jesus Christ says, blessed  of the poor, blessed of those who grieve, blessed of those who rejected, woe to the rich,  woe to those who are in power. Well, remember that? Jesus is calling for justice. Jesus saying,  we have to oppose injustice, we've got to go against injustice, but you must turn the other cheek.

Well, wait a minute, you say, how can you say we have to oppose injustice, but then we have to turn  the other cheek? Think of what this means. First of all, why do you strike somebody on the cheek,  to knock them out? To rob them? No, no, no, no, you don't have to be a martial arts expert.

You go for the job, if you're trying to knock them out, you go for the solar plexus, you go for the  feet. Why do you slap somebody on the cheek to insult them? And why do you turn the cheek? Now, even in our society, women do this in a way that men tend to not, but we still do it. Whenever I go to see my sister, whenever I go to see my sister-in-laws, if ever I'm going,  you know, and my family's coming to see their family, they come on out and what do they say?

You know, my sister goes like this. Hi, what's she doing? She wants to be kissed. She was greeting me and she wants me to greet her. Now, here's what  Jesus is saying.

He's saying, I want you to oppose injustice, but I want you to do it without any,  without any inner touchiness about your ego, without, you've been insulted, so what? He says, I want you to oppose injustice, but you don't go out to slap them back. You don't go out,  you oppose injustice for the sake of justice. You oppose injustice out of love for the person,  the perpetrator, it's never loving to let somebody do injustice and sin. And you oppose injustice  for the sake of the people around.

You oppose injustice for it's sake, for the person's sake,  for everybody else's sake, you never do it. Just simply to say, I'm going to make that person  feel bad, I'm going to make that person know they were wrong. I'm going to, in other words,  Jesus said, not this slapping stuff. This is exactly the opposite of how you and I do it,  because Jesus says, I want you to directly, courageously openly say, what you did was wrong,  but inside you've forgiven them. Why?

Because you have the emotional humility, because you are an  enemy, but you have the emotional wealth, because you're adopted, that you don't have anything to prove,  because you know you are a sinner. You see, you have the emotional humility, you know you're a  sinner, but you have the emotional wealth, because hey, look what I've got in Jesus. Whatever they  took from me, you know, my reputation, whatever this person did to me, it's not the most important  thing to me. You know, Jesus is the most important thing. And therefore, because you have an inner  forgiveness and you have, your pride's not all hurt on the inside, you walk out and you oppose  that person with poise, you know, without a lot of rancor, without a lot of vengeance and venom  at all, okay?

So you speak out, but inside you're at peace, but that's not how we do it, you know  it happens when someone wrongs us, we say nothing, we say I don't want to rock the boat, but inside  we're burning up with her pride. And Jesus says, I call you to be the opposite, the opposite. And you can. Look, practical ramifications are so many. We're a church, right?

Why is it in this community? To some degree, people who don't have the best jobs and they don't  have the best bodies may very often feel just as, just as sort of shunned as people as they  feel out in the rest of the world that has to stop. Yeah. Secondly, a lot of you need to start telling  the truth to people who have hurt you after you've worked on your own heart and forgiveness. Then you go to them for their sake.

Do you realize that the only way to beat injustice  is not to be bitter? Because if you're bitter against what people have done to you,  then they have turned you into what they are, but they're controlling you. The only way to really  beat injustice is to utterly forgive it and then oppose it with a certain amount of joy. Some of you got people you're going to have to talk to. And lastly, Jesus was the good Samaritan.

He was the true good neighbor. Why did I call this  love in the neighborhood? I'll tell you why because when you say love by neighbor, it's so vague and  pie. Somebody thinks about, what does that mean? I'll tell you what it means.

Your neighbor,  Jesus says, is anybody that you share God's green earth with. So if you're a Christian,  look around your neighborhood. Do you ignore them and just go after the Christians? Do you know  your neighbors? Anybody there, Jesus Christ says, you need to treat as if they were me.

Find them. Look for deliberate reasons to be for the common good of your neighborhood. Because Jesus Christ, when he gave the good Samaritan parable, he was saying, I'll tell you who your  neighbor is. He says, a Jew was in the road and along comes the Samaritan. The Jew was bleeding  member and he's in the road and along comes the Samaritan and they hated each other.

Jesus Christ might have just as well said, a Ku Klux Klan wizard was bleeding and lying in the  road and an African-American came along. He could have said a Serb was lying in the road and a  Kosovoire came along. He could have said a Nazi was laying in the road, bleeding and dying,  and along a Jew came along. He's trying to say absolutely anybody in your road is now your  neighbor because you were anybody to me. Look what I did.

You talk about resources for social  justice. You talk about resources for bringing down barriers. Nothing will do what this can do,  but if you want to be a neighbor, first you need a neighbor. You need to see that Jesus Christ was  the one who comes along as in that parable and you were laying on the road and what did he do? What's the parable say?

He got down and he puts you up where he was. He puts you on his steed  and he goes down on the ground and that's what Jesus did. You were lying in the road. He puts you  and gives you his status. He gives you his standing.

He gives you his righteousness. He gives you his  place and he took our place until you are amazed with the mercy he gave. You will never be empowered  to provide the mercy he requires. Let's pray. We thank you, Lord, for this kind of resource.

This is dynamite. This is like a fuse. All we have to do is light it. But now help us to light it.

### English Transcript (for reference)

the teaching is based, it's  read it together, Luke chapter 6 verses 27 to 38. But I tell you who hear me, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those  who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also. If someone takes your cloak, do not stop him from taking your tunic. If someone gives to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do  not demand it back, due to others as you would have them, due to you.

If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them, and if you do good to those who are good to you,  what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that, and if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit  is that to you? Even sinners, lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full. But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend them without expecting to get anything  back, and then your reward will be great.

And you will be sons of the most high, because he is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked. Be merciful just as your father is merciful. Do not judge, and you won't be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.

Given it will be given to you. A good measure, press down, shaken together, running over, will be poured into your lap. For with a measure you use, it will be measured to you. This is God's Word. We are looking at the sermon on the mount, because this is one of the best places to find  out what concretely Christianity looks like when it is lived out.

What does it mean to actually live a Christian life? And one of the problems with the sermon on the mount is that there are so many great trees  that you miss the forest. Now the trees are the individual subjects. In the sermon on the mount, we get into certain, very important and very hot, ethical subjects. So we get into guidelines for money, for sex, for relationships, honesty, promises,  you get into all these things.

Very interesting. But because it is so interesting, you can often miss the context. And what we did was before Easter, we spent two Sundays working on the context. There's two very basic principles. Things you've got to keep in mind all the time when you're reading.

Otherwise you're going to miss the forest for the trees. Now what are those two principles? And I want to lay them out right away because it's easy to forget. It's been three weeks, two weeks ago. First of all, the sermon on the well given to you together.

First of all, the sermon on the mount must not be read individually or moralistically. Now by individualistically we mean this. The sermon on the mount talks about how to conduct our relationships, how to treat our  attitude toward our money, and so on. And in our society, because we live in an individualistic, privatized society, most of  you are going to sit down and say, good, this will give me guidelines for making personal  decisions on things. And it will, of course.

But what the sermon on the mount is really about is about a kingdom, remember? We talked about that three weeks ago. A God's kingdom on earth. In other words, the sermon on the mount is talking about an alternate community. It's talking about what a community would look like that's ruled not by the world's  values of power and success, and acclaim, and approval, and appearance, but by the kingdom  of God's values, a sacrifice and service.

And so what it's really doing here is it's showing us a community, an alternate society  in which people get together as Christians, we say we're going to live in this way. And so it's a way to show the world what business practices would look like, what race relationships  would look like, what our family life would look like, what our psychological life would  look like, our friendships. And therefore you can't get the grace of the sermon on the mount by just coming to church  even every Sunday, getting inspiration going home and saying, now I know how to live my  life. You've got to be part of the community. Now, let me put it this way, who's got your number?

Who are you accountable to? In Hebrews 3 it says, exhort one another daily, less your heart get hard. Now I want to ask you a question, who is exhorting a daily to keep your heart soft? Who is exhorting you as a Christian? Who are you talking to, for example, who are you talking to as a Christian about how much  money to spend on yourself and how much money to give away?

You say, as a typical Western individualist to person, you say, how I spend my money  as my business. In other words, you're not part of a community. You're not part of a counter-culture. You're not part of the thing that the servant on the mount is talking about. The servant on the mount is calling us to be part of a community and until you are part  of a community, not just visiting church on Sunday, even every Sunday, but part of  a community of people who are saying, we're going to live this out together.

You cannot obey, then you're not obeying the servant on the mount. So we can't read it individually. I've got to say that every so often. The second thing, and this will be even more brief because it comes out as the servant  goes on, we must not read the servant on the mount moralistically, which means when  you read an ECG's saying, here's how I want you to live. It is natural for people to say, aha, this is how I can please God.

This is how I can reach God. I'm going to live like this. Then God will bless me. Then God will give me his salvation. Then God will give me his grace.

Now listen. He said religion, things like that, Christianity doesn't. Religion is outside in. If I do all these things on the outside, God will give me his grace in here. Christianity is inside out.

Christianity says only when I already have his blessing, already have his grace, already  have a new heart, already have that change, will I be able to live out in this way. The servant on the mount assumes the new heart. It assumes the grace, the blessing. It doesn't say, here's how to get it. It assumes you've already got it and you say, well, how can that be?

The whole point of the servant on the mount is to say, religion can never produce this  kind of life. Can you say, how can that be? Well, that will be seen as we go. So we mustn't read it individualistically, and we mustn't read it moralistically. That's the farest.

Now, let's get to the first tree because we're going to do this for the rest of the  spring, all the way to June. The first tree is relationships. What we have here in this very famous passage that we just read, there's another version  of it in Matthew 5, but it's a lot longer than the other place where we have the servant  on the mount. There's a shorter version of it, and therefore, I pull it out because it fits the page,  see? It's on the page.

Now, and Matthew 5 did not. Much of the other reasons. So relationships, that's the first subject. Now, as soon as you hear the word relationships, right away you say, ah, relationships, you're  thinking of friendship, or love and marriage and romance. And of course, everything in here absolutely applies, especially to marriage.

Love your enemies. Do good to those who curse you. Okay? In other words, and you know what, I can't even get back to this as funny as that is, as  funny as that is, if this is the behavior that God demands, that we take with people  who are hostile to us, it's obvious that he expects us to give it in our friendships  and in our marriages. We can't expect that God expects us to do less for people that we are close to than people  in our neighborhood.

However, the main purpose of this passage is not to talk about friendships and love relationships. The main purpose is to talk about our relationships to other people outside of our friendships as  a matter of fact. And therefore, if you look through here, you'll see Jesus right away starts off with three  cases. He's talking about three kinds, three groups of people right away, and he tells us what  behavior he expects. Now, let's look and see what he's calling for.

And then we'll immediately be shocked, upset, and then we'll have to say, okay, how can  we do it? Now, the first thing, the first group of people is people who oppose you. People who are against you, people who have wronged you. And that's why we see love your enemies, those who hate you, those who curse you, hating  and curse you means they will you ill. And then those who mistreat you and those who struck you on the cheek, those are people  who have done you ill.

And Jesus says, I want you to love them, I want you to care for them, I want you to pray  for them, I want you to pull for them. And I want you to as much as possible be good to them. That's the first group. The second group are people not who have wronged you, but people less fortunate than you. Now you see, if you read this, there's a tendency when it says, if someone takes your cloak,  do you not stop them from taking your tunic?

And there's a tendency to stick that sentence with what came before, in which case it looks  like it's saying, when someone robs you, say, oh, by the way, here's my safe behind this  picture. But what it's saying, because this sentence actually goes grammatically and logically  with what comes after, give to everyone who asks you. And if anyone takes what belongs, you don't demand it back to others as you would have  them do to you. Now you see this dude others as you have to do to you. If we're talking about robbery here, that doesn't fit, does it?

It sounds like it's saying, well, when you're robbing somebody, how would you want to be treated? No, that's not what it's saying. It couldn't be saying that. And rather, the word take and ask are synonyms, just like, you see, hate and curse and mistreat  are synonyms. And what it's saying is, when someone comes, and they say, I'm in need, you're supposed  to be promiscuously generous, Earl Ellis, who wrote a wonderful commentary, I'm going  to quote him a couple times, wrote a great commentary on the book of Luke.

This is what he says about this passage. He says, this right here where it says, ask, anyone who asks of you give, not just your  cook but your tunic. He says, Christ is not here advocating perfunctory or even large gifts to the poor. Get this. He enjoins a moral concern that will express itself in a spirit of self-denial in every encounter  of life.

And that will do, and will do this for the sake of the kingdom of God. He says, a spirit of self-denial that is part of every encounter in life. Now here's what that means. It means you are so concerned for people who have less than you. But you don't even go out and buy a chair without thinking about them.

You say, OK, I'm going to go buy a chair, but I've got to make sure I buy a chair in  such a way that I have money to give away. I mean, it's going to affect everything, not just your outer coat, but your tunic. It's a way of saying that every single part of your life be oriented toward promiscuous  generosity. You're never not thinking about it. It's not enough to say, well, you know, every time somebody comes and takes an offering  or somebody asks to give it to the office, I'm pretty generous.

This is much, much more extensive than that. So first of all, you have people who have wronged you. Secondly, you have people who have less than you, who have a more less fortunate you. But here's the last one. It's more subtle.

Thirdly, people who are indifferent and different. Now, if you look at the rest of this, it says, if you love those who love you, if you  love those who can be good to you, if you love those who can repay you, now, what is  he talking about? And then he says, even sinners, now, here's what he's talking about. Think about it for a minute, especially when he gets to the bottom. He says, I want you to be kind to the ungrateful and the wicked, see that?

That's who's in that paragraph. Now, let me put it like this. Everybody's like this. Let's say you're a member of a political party, whether you're conservative or liberal. Maybe if you're in the middle, this doesn't count because you don't consider yourself  part of a party, a certain political outlook.

But let's say you have a racial. If you're Anglo, it doesn't mean you may be not in a dominant society where Anglo is  your dominant. It may not be quite as conscious of your race. But if you are African-American or Latin, Latino, or Asian-American, you're more conscious  of race, no matter who you are, there's a tendency to see another group of people. Over there, and it's not your group.

And at the very, very best, you don't respect them very much. And at the very, very worst, you think that they're the problem in society. At the very best, you don't respect them. At the very worst, you think they're the problem in society. Now, you will probably think, but I know some of these people.

I'm friendly with them. Some of them are kind of friends with me. I see them at the office, or I see them at work, or they're that sort of thing. Or I went to school with some of them. I know some of them, however, they are, basically, they're different.

They're not like you. And you actually think of them as sort of kind of strange in many ways, or even people  that you really just don't respect. Now, you may be civil to them, but you don't do for them. You don't do good. You don't lay yourself out.

You don't open your heart home. You don't open your purse. You don't open your heart. You don't open your life. You hang with the people who are like you.

The people you respect. And Jesus comes along and says, of course, everybody's like that. That's the gist of his point in here. Absolutely, everybody's like that. He's talking to people.

And when he uses the word sinners here, you see the word sinners? Why is it in quotations? Why is it in quotes? Jesus never uses the word sinners, except in quotes, usually. Here's why.

Remember, like in Luke 15, when the Pharisees come and say, he eats with sinners. And see, they mean by sinners, irreligious, immoral people, prostitutes, tax collectors,  Roman collaborators, stuff like that. And Jesus doesn't use the word that way. He doesn't divide the world into sinners and the nice religious people. So it must mean he's talking to the kind of people who use the word like that.

And what he's saying to them is absolutely everybody on the surface, you say, I'm religious  and they're not, but absolutely everybody does is what do they do? You walk into a room and you look around at the other people in the room and you say,  are these my kind of people? Do I want to be here? Do I want to associate with them? Do they make me feel more about myself like I want to feel?

Now, Jesus is saying, everybody does it. Now let's just say you're a worldly person. Well, what you're going to do is you're going to walk into the room and you're going to  look around and you see people that look less cool, less savvy, less accomplished than  you, people that, you know, you tried real hard to keep yourself in shape and dress nicely  and these people look kind of like slabs and, you know, you'll put up with them for  a while. You're not going to open up. These people do not make you feel about yourself the way you want to feel.

You go into these rooms and you say, are these the kind of people that will move me up socially  to be accepted by the people that want to be accepted by and will these people move  me up psychologically so that I feel about myself the way I want to feel about myself. And if these people aren't as cool as you think you might be at least, at least try to  be, if they're not as, if they're not as acclaimed, if they're not as pulled together, if they're  not as accomplished, if they're not as good looking, then you just find your way out of that  room. And here was, what Jesus is saying is, okay, but what about religious people? Are they different? No.

Religious people come on in and they look around and religious people need to feel that they're  pretty good because all religious people deeply need the assurance that they're good. Why? Because they're basic, they're, they're whole identity on the idea, I'm a good person. If I live a good enough life, if I obey the similar amount, if I do all the things right,  then God will love me. But you never know you're good enough.

So you desperately need assurance that you are. So when you walk in, you look at people and you say, are these, are these my kind of  people? Are these upright decent people? Are these people that will help me get accepted by the people I need to feel accepted  by if I'm going to feel okay about myself? Are these the kind of people that make me feel like I'm a decent person that I have the  right ideas, that I have the right beliefs, that I have the right doctrines, that I have  the right practices?

Jesus says, you're all the same. And he says, however, therefore Jesus is not contrasting two ways, he's contrasting  three ways. He's saying, here's how sinners do it, here's how religious people do it, and Christians  have to be different than both. He says, I know everybody respects civilly. I mean, they show respect to the people whose beliefs differ with theirs, people that they  don't respect much, people who are other, but you're going to be different.

Jesus' Christians are going to give, they're going to do good, they're going to lend, they're  going to open their hearts, they're going to open their lives, they're going to deliberately  look for opportunities as much as possible to do for people who are very different from  you, the kind of things that everybody else only does for their own kind. And therefore Jesus is saying, here's how you treat enemies, love and forgiveness. Here's how you treat people who are less fortunate than you, and here's how you treat people  who are different and indifferent to you, the people that you consider ungrateful and  wicked. And Jesus says, that's how I want you to live. Now let's stop for one second.

Most religions have a lot of ethics to go on these lines, but everybody agrees that at  this point Jesus has broken through his burst the banks. When he starts to say, love your enemies. When he starts to say, live lives of promiscuous generosity. And when he says, I want you to alone amongst the face of the earth, be people who are deliberately  able to with love and without any disrespect, share and serve people who are utterly different  than you. In fact he goes this far, in a sense what he's doing in here is he's saying, the mark that  you're a Christian, the thing that differentiates a Christian from people who are both religious  and irreligious is their attitude toward people who are deeply different than they are.

Do you act superior to them? Or the people who are come against you, do you pay them back, or do you forgive them and  serve them without superiority? Jesus, that's how we know that you belong to me. Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer, or are you hoping to help new  believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith? For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding  of what it means to follow Christ.

A great resource to start using this summer is the new city catechism devotional, God's  truth for our hearts and minds. This devotional brings the historic catechisms of the Christian Church to life, offering  a question to consider for each week of the year. In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catechesis, the rich and communal  practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers that frame the foundational beliefs  of the Christian faith. Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer, and a brief meditation that will challenge  and inspire you. The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller, and  Kevin D.

Young, as well as historical figures such as Augustine, John Calvin, and Martin  Luther. This month, in addition to the new city catechism devotional, we are including a great  companion resource, the new city catechism for kids, as our thank you for your gift to  help gospel and life share the hope of Christ's love with people all over the world. So request your copies today at gospelonlife.com slash give. That's gospelonlife.com slash give. Now here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching.

I'll write away people say, first of all, A, I can't do it, and B, if I did, I think  it sounds like suicide, right? People say it's impossible for me inside, and even if it was possible, it seems like,  you know, it would be suicidal. Well, listen briefly, but there's an awful lot of stuff packed into this passage. Briefly, there's three things that Jesus says, almost as if he knows people are going  to say that. He says, let me tell you what the difficulty is, and let me tell you what inner dynamic  you need to have, and then let me give you some directions, difference, difficulty, dynamic  and directions, and here's what they are.

First of all, he says, here's what the basic, basic difficulty is. Three times, he says, if you love only those who love you, what credit is that, or he  says, if you love, if you only do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that? And then three times, he says, what credit is that? Now, that's a hard thing to, if you read that, it's kind of vague. It's a little ambiguous.

What does it mean? What credit is that? Credit with who? And the NIV, the translation we have there, is trying to be ambiguous, and it ought to  be ambiguous, because it's a very, very interesting and pregnant and multi, I think basically,  multi-dimensional thing. Jesus is actually saying, literally, I'll tell you what he's saying.

He says, if you love those who love you, and he says, what grace? This is there in that. Because the word that's translated credit is the New Testament word for grace, caress. It's the New Testament word that means unmerited love. And when he says, if you only love those who love you, where's the unmerited love in  that?

Well, now that's a little weird, but here's what he's saying. Number one, he's saying, when you love your own kind, and not others, when you love people  who are giving you some kind of emotional payoff or some kind of social payoff, that they're  helping you socially, or they're helping you in your self-esteem, whenever you, you know,  I mean, you've got to be careful. Think about this. Religious people look like they're kind of working with draining people, and they're  working with needy people, you know, they look like it very often, but why? Why are you doing it?

Are you not doing it so that you can say, I know God loves me, because look at the kind  of person I am. In that case, you see, Jesus is saying, when you only love people for a payoff, it's  not really that you don't love well enough, you're not loving it all. Jesus is saying, don't look at my standard and say, well, I love people, but not like that. Jesus says, if you love people because of what they profit you, you're not loving them  at all, you're loving what they give you, you're loving your own ego, and you're using  them to fulfill it. You're not loving them for their sakes.

You're loving them for your sake. You're not loving it all. There's no loving at all. Here's Person A, and here's Person B, and Person A is cool, and Person B is a slob and  kind of draining, and you love this one, much more than you love that one, why? You know, it has nothing to do with them, has everything to do with you, it's not about  them.

My goodness, you can be attracted, you can have a crush on this person, and it's not  about them. It's about you, boy, the person who looks like this, and of a person who is this kind of  position in society, and of a person who's got looks like this, if they like me back,  then I'll know I'm somebody. And Jesus is saying, there's no love here at all, because what you're doing is you're  loving on the basis of their merits with regard to your self-esteem. So first of all he's saying, your love isn't love, but then secondly he's saying, and  here's the reason you are indeficent. If you only love those who love you, where's the love in you, and what he means is simply  this.

Think of an investment banker, you know, some of you are, all right, now let's just say  you are just rolling at it, not just saying, you know, and you're personally wealthy, and  you're just absolutely rolling at it, you're an investor, let's not say you're an investment  banker, you're an investor, and you're just rolling at it, and you know, you have a  number of opportunities that come before you. If you're just rolling at it, you know what? You can look at a product and say, I like this new business, I'll capitalize it, why? Because I like the product, because I think it's good for people, because I like the attitude  of the entrepreneur, right? Even though I don't know if it's going to work, but I like that, so I'm going to do it.

Okay, but what if you're an investor sucking air? What if you're an investor in a lot of trouble? What if you're an investor saying, man, I've got to make a major profit on the next  investment, then I'm sorry, you're only going to put your money, not whether it's a good  product, not whether you like the entrepreneur, you've got to put it wherever you're going  to get a payoff. Now, Jesus Christ is saying, everybody on the face of the earth is an investor sucking  air when it comes to love. You are not sure about who you are, you are not sure of yourself, that's the reason why  you make such distinctions in who you love and who you go out with.

And I would say, I'm talking about friendship, man, I'm talking about romance, but I'm  also just talking about who you associate with, who you sit down with, who you spend time  with, how much time and how much heart you put into a conversation on the street is all  going to have to do, Jesus says, with what's happening in your heart. And he says, because you're in deficit, you're not loving it all, you're investing in  anybody that can give you the payoff you need. And that's the problem, because that inner love deficit, that inner grace deficit,  you're going to have to experience unmerited love, you're going to have to experience an  ocean of unmerited love, if you're going to be able to give it. So that's the difficulty. So what's the dynamic?

The dynamic is right here at the very end, now take a quick close look. First of all, and I'm going to read you what Earl Ellis says, first of all, Jesus says,  then your reward would be great and you'll be sons of the most high because he is kind  to the ungrateful and the wicked. If you can get ahold of that verse, if you believe it, you know it, you understand it,  you're taking the center of your life, you'll have the dynamic that will enable you to begin  to move out and do what Jesus Christ is saying. You'll want to do it, you'll actually be able to take steps. If you don't believe that verse, if you don't understand what's in it, then everything  Jesus calls you to is at best impossible and at worst dangerous rubbish.

But what if you understand what's in there or what's in there, two things? First of all, excuse me, it she knows, okay? Please go away. The first thing it says is your sons of the father. Earl Ellis in his commentary on Luke says, you have to be very careful because it looks  the way the English translation comes out, doesn't it?

It looks like if I give love, then I'll become a son of God, right? It says, then you will be. It sounds like, then you will become, but that's not what the Greek sense is at all. This is what he says. He says, this is spoken to disciples for whom God is already your father.

What Jesus is doing here is inviting his disciples to actualize in their ethic the meaning  of their relationship. They are called to be what you are. Now what this means is a Christian has to understand that I'm adopted. What is adoption? Now John chapter 1 verse 12, Paul and Galatians 4 says, even though everybody is a  creation of God and therefore loved and valued by God, it is an act of grace when we are  adopted.

Now to be adopted means something very important and in those days, if an heir was, let's  just say, a wealthy person, a wealthy man or woman had no children, what was very normal  for them to do is they would take some other adult and they would adopt them and then  that person would become their heir and what would happen at the moment of adoption and  that's the background to everything the New Testament understands about our relationship  with God. Adoption, first of all, it's a legal grace because you might be penniless, but the second  that the seal is put on your adoption papers suddenly, even though you haven't done anything  to work for it, suddenly, automatically, you're rich. By grace, legally, by standing in an instant, but the second thing is you don't just have  this wealth. You have a new intimacy, suddenly this great person is no longer your CEO, no longer your  prime minister, this person is your father and that means you have intimacy with him,  it means your relationship is permanent, a father's love for a child gets stronger when  it does wrong. You also have accessibility, don't call the CEO or don't call the prime minister up  at 2 a.m. to ask for a glass of water, that won't be considered right, but a son or  a daughter can ask.

And so suddenly, now that is assumed here, do you understand that relationship? Do you understand that the Lord of heaven and earth is your father that you've been adopted  by grace? In spite of everything you are, you're rich in him, you're loved permanently, you are  loved unconditionally, you are loved comprehensively, that's an assumption. I can't go into all that now, I'm not going to go into all that now, this passage doesn't  explain adoption, it assumes it and you have to understand that that's the first point. The first thing you have to understand to get that dynamic is are you adopted, do you understand  what that means?

Is that the greatest thing about you? Is that really the source of everything? But then secondly, it says for he is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked. Now you see, the ungrateful and the wicked is a parallel with everything that's been  going up. In other words, Jesus is saying here, I want you to be like your father because he has  been gracious to his enemies, he's been gracious to his enemies, and who are those enemies?

Wow, us, and this is the dynamite, and I tell you, if you can light this dynamite, you  can light the fuse on this and here's how you do it, a Christian understands him or herself  to be an adopted enemy, an adopted enemy, two things, on the one hand you were an enemy,  now neither religious nor irreligious people believe their enemies of God, and I don't have  the time and this isn't the place, because this passage doesn't go into it. For me to explain all of how that operates, but here's the way, religious people never  think of themselves as enemies of God, they say I'm trying so hard, I'm trying very hard  to be like God, I'm trying to do it all, and irreligious people say, well I'm indifferent  or I have trouble believing, but they don't consider themselves enemies of God, and one  of the ways you know that you're a Christian, that the basis for your relationship with God  is on grace, and not by your performance and your achievement and your good works, is  that you've come to understand that you are an enemy, that means that you have just  you have resented his claim on your every centimeter of your life, and you have even  come to see that even your efforts to be good have really been ways of trying to get control  of a God and get him to have to do things for you, and a Christian is somebody who says  I'm an enemy, but I'm adopted, and when you put those two things together, everything  that's in here flows out, why, where do you see, where do you say, well that's interesting  conceptually, all right, you have to melt your heart with it, where do you see God really  being kind of the ungrateful and the wicked on the cross, because on the cross you see  him cursed, but he's blessing, on the cross you see him mistreated, but he's praying,  just like Jesus is not saying, Jesus is not just simply saying, be like this, and he's  not just simply saying, be like this because I'm like this, he's saying, be like this  because I am going to be like this for you, and when that happens, when you see that,  in other words, when you see him loving you, and let me ask you a question, what did  loving you do for Jesus' social standing? Jesus didn't just get nothing out of you,  he went infinitely down, he came from heaven to earth, as the song goes, he came from  earth to the grave. He went all the way down, let me ask another question, what did Jesus  Christ get out of you, not socially, but psychologically, what did he do for his self-esteem? He made him to be sin who knew no sin.

Look, here is Jesus Christ who looks at you and  loves you for you, not only did he get nothing out of you, he got exactly the opposite  of what you seek to get out of your relationships, unless you see that on the one hand, you were  so lost, he had to die for you, on the other hand, you were so loved that he had to die for  you. And when you take that in and you see him doing that, you will have finally the  answer to the love deficit, the unmerited love deficit, and you will look out there  and you'll see people and you'll say no matter how broken they are, I was broken, no  matter how mistaken they are, look at all their wrong views, I was mistaken. Even though they're  even other hostile to you, I was hostile to him while he was doing it. I was upset as he was  reaching out to me, we were jeering Adam in a sense, humankind was jeering Adam while he was dying  for us, and you'll never be the same again when that gets all your heart. And then what happens  is here's the directions, then what difference does that actually make?

Two things. First of all,  turn the other cheek, and then forgive. Or you say turn the other cheek, that's the problem,  that seems very, very impractical, oh really, now think about it for a second. First of all,  look at verse 27-28, these are very famous places. Love your enemy, pray for those, pull for them,  turn the other cheek.

Well, it sounds like it's saying, you just walk all over me, that's all right,  hit me again, I'm still breathing. Listen, first of all, look at the word butt. What's the word  butt, therefore? It's a contrast. Well, what came before it?

Well, we read it three weeks ago,  Jesus Christ in the beginning of Luke, this is the Luke version. Jesus Christ says, blessed  of the poor, blessed of those who grieve, blessed of those who rejected, woe to the rich,  woe to those who are in power. Well, remember that? Jesus is calling for justice. Jesus saying,  we have to oppose injustice, we've got to go against injustice, but you must turn the other cheek.

Well, wait a minute, you say, how can you say we have to oppose injustice, but then we have to turn  the other cheek? Think of what this means. First of all, why do you strike somebody on the cheek,  to knock them out? To rob them? No, no, no, no, you don't have to be a martial arts expert.

You go for the job, if you're trying to knock them out, you go for the solar plexus, you go for the  feet. Why do you slap somebody on the cheek to insult them? And why do you turn the cheek? Now, even in our society, women do this in a way that men tend to not, but we still do it. Whenever I go to see my sister, whenever I go to see my sister-in-laws, if ever I'm going,  you know, and my family's coming to see their family, they come on out and what do they say?

You know, my sister goes like this. Hi, what's she doing? She wants to be kissed. She was greeting me and she wants me to greet her. Now, here's what  Jesus is saying.

He's saying, I want you to oppose injustice, but I want you to do it without any,  without any inner touchiness about your ego, without, you've been insulted, so what? He says, I want you to oppose injustice, but you don't go out to slap them back. You don't go out,  you oppose injustice for the sake of justice. You oppose injustice out of love for the person,  the perpetrator, it's never loving to let somebody do injustice and sin. And you oppose injustice  for the sake of the people around.

You oppose injustice for it's sake, for the person's sake,  for everybody else's sake, you never do it. Just simply to say, I'm going to make that person  feel bad, I'm going to make that person know they were wrong. I'm going to, in other words,  Jesus said, not this slapping stuff. This is exactly the opposite of how you and I do it,  because Jesus says, I want you to directly, courageously openly say, what you did was wrong,  but inside you've forgiven them. Why?

Because you have the emotional humility, because you are an  enemy, but you have the emotional wealth, because you're adopted, that you don't have anything to prove,  because you know you are a sinner. You see, you have the emotional humility, you know you're a  sinner, but you have the emotional wealth, because hey, look what I've got in Jesus. Whatever they  took from me, you know, my reputation, whatever this person did to me, it's not the most important  thing to me. You know, Jesus is the most important thing. And therefore, because you have an inner  forgiveness and you have, your pride's not all hurt on the inside, you walk out and you oppose  that person with poise, you know, without a lot of rancor, without a lot of vengeance and venom  at all, okay?

So you speak out, but inside you're at peace, but that's not how we do it, you know  it happens when someone wrongs us, we say nothing, we say I don't want to rock the boat, but inside  we're burning up with her pride. And Jesus says, I call you to be the opposite, the opposite. And you can. Look, practical ramifications are so many. We're a church, right?

Why is it in this community? To some degree, people who don't have the best jobs and they don't  have the best bodies may very often feel just as, just as sort of shunned as people as they  feel out in the rest of the world that has to stop. Yeah. Secondly, a lot of you need to start telling  the truth to people who have hurt you after you've worked on your own heart and forgiveness. Then you go to them for their sake.

Do you realize that the only way to beat injustice  is not to be bitter? Because if you're bitter against what people have done to you,  then they have turned you into what they are, but they're controlling you. The only way to really  beat injustice is to utterly forgive it and then oppose it with a certain amount of joy. Some of you got people you're going to have to talk to. And lastly, Jesus was the good Samaritan.

He was the true good neighbor. Why did I call this  love in the neighborhood? I'll tell you why because when you say love by neighbor, it's so vague and  pie. Somebody thinks about, what does that mean? I'll tell you what it means.

Your neighbor,  Jesus says, is anybody that you share God's green earth with. So if you're a Christian,  look around your neighborhood. Do you ignore them and just go after the Christians? Do you know  your neighbors? Anybody there, Jesus Christ says, you need to treat as if they were me.

Find them. Look for deliberate reasons to be for the common good of your neighborhood. Because Jesus Christ, when he gave the good Samaritan parable, he was saying, I'll tell you who your  neighbor is. He says, a Jew was in the road and along comes the Samaritan. The Jew was bleeding  member and he's in the road and along comes the Samaritan and they hated each other.

Jesus Christ might have just as well said, a Ku Klux Klan wizard was bleeding and lying in the  road and an African-American came along. He could have said a Serb was lying in the road and a  Kosovoire came along. He could have said a Nazi was laying in the road, bleeding and dying,  and along a Jew came along. He's trying to say absolutely anybody in your road is now your  neighbor because you were anybody to me. Look what I did.

You talk about resources for social  justice. You talk about resources for bringing down barriers. Nothing will do what this can do,  but if you want to be a neighbor, first you need a neighbor. You need to see that Jesus Christ was  the one who comes along as in that parable and you were laying on the road and what did he do? What's the parable say?

He got down and he puts you up where he was. He puts you on his steed  and he goes down on the ground and that's what Jesus did. You were lying in the road. He puts you  and gives you his status. He gives you his standing.

He gives you his righteousness. He gives you his  place and he took our place until you are amazed with the mercy he gave. You will never be empowered  to provide the mercy he requires. Let's pray. We thank you, Lord, for this kind of resource.

This is dynamite. This is like a fuse. All we have to do is light it. But now help us to light it.

这是上帝的话。

我们正在看登山宝训，因为这是最能让我们看见：当基督信仰被具体活出来时，基督徒生活究竟是什么样子。

到底什么叫“过基督徒的生活”？登山宝训其中一个问题是：里面有太多好树，以至于你会错过整片森林。所谓“树”，就是其中一个个主题。在登山宝训里，我们会进入一些非常重要、也非常火热的伦理议题：关于金钱、关于性、关于人际关系、关于诚实、关于承诺——你会进入所有这些。

非常有意思。但正因为太有意思，你常常会错过其上下文。

在复活节之前，我们用两个主日专门讲上下文。有两个非常基本的原则：你读登山宝训时必须一直记在心里，否则你就会“见树不见林”。

这两个原则是什么？我想立刻把它们摆出来，因为很容易忘。已经过了三周——不，是两周？首先，登山宝训必须一起领受。

第一，登山宝训不可以用“个人主义”或“道德主义”的方式来读。

所谓“个人主义”的意思是：登山宝训谈的是我们如何处理关系、如何看待金钱等等。在我们的社会里，因为我们生活在一个个人主义、私有化的社会，你们大多数人坐下来会说：很好，这会给我关于个人决定的指引。它当然会。

但登山宝训真正讲的是“国度”，记得吗？我们三周前讲过——上帝在地上的国度。换句话说，登山宝训讲的是一个“替代性的群体”，讲的是一个由上帝国度掌权的群体会是什么样子：这个群体不是被世界的价值——权力、成功、名望、认可、外表——所支配，而是被上帝国度的价值——牺牲与服事——所支配。

因此，登山宝训真正做的是：向我们展示一个群体、一个替代性的社会——基督徒聚在一起，说“我们要这样生活”。它是让世界看见：商业实践会是什么样子、种族关系会是什么样子、家庭生活会是什么样子、心理生活会是什么样子、友情会是什么样子。

所以，你不可能只是来教会——哪怕每个主日都来——得点感动回家，然后说：“现在我知道该怎么过了。”你必须成为这个群体的一部分。

我换个说法：谁知道你的情况？你向谁负责？希伯来书第 3 章说：“总要趁着还有今日，天天彼此相劝，免得你们中间有人被罪迷惑，心里就刚硬了。”我要问你：每天在劝勉你、使你心不刚硬的人是谁？是谁在作为基督徒劝勉你？

比如说，作为基督徒，你在和谁谈：自己该在自己身上花多少钱、该拿多少钱出去施舍？

作为一个典型的西方个人主义者，你会说：“我钱怎么花是我的事。”换句话说，你并不在一个群体里；你不在一个“反文化”的群体里；你不在登山宝训所说的那种群体里。

登山宝训呼召我们成为一个群体的一部分；在你成为一个群体的一部分之前——不是仅仅主日来“探访”教会，哪怕每个主日都来——而是成为一群人中的一员，一群人说：“我们要一起把这些活出来。”在那之前，你就不可能遵行登山宝训；那你就没有在遵行登山宝训。

所以我们不能用个人主义读它。我得不时提醒一次。

第二点会更简短，因为随着登山宝训继续展开，它会越来越清楚：我们也不可以用“道德主义”来读登山宝训。

道德主义的意思是：当你读到耶稣说“我要你这样生活”，人自然会说：“啊哈，这就是我取悦上帝的方法。这就是我达到上帝的方法。我这样活，上帝就祝福我；上帝就把救恩给我；上帝就把恩典给我。”

听着：宗教是这样运作的，基督教不是。宗教是“由外而内”：我在外面做这些事，上帝就把恩典给到我里面。基督教是“由内而外”：只有当我已经有了他的祝福、已经有了他的恩典、已经得了新心、已经经历改变，我才有可能这样活出来。

登山宝训是在“假设”新心的；它假设恩典与祝福。它不是说“怎么得到”，而是默认你已经得着了，然后你会说：“那怎么可能？”登山宝训的要点之一就是：宗教永远产不出这种生命。

你会说：“怎么会？”我们往下走就会看见。

所以，我们不能个人主义地读它，也不能道德主义地读它——这就是“森林”。

现在，我们来到第一棵树——我们接下来整个春天一直到六月都会这样一棵棵看。第一棵树是：人际关系。

我们刚读的这一段非常有名。马太福音 5 章里也有另一段版本，但那里更长；而在路加福音中，登山宝训有这一段较短的版本，所以我把它抽出来——它刚好能放在这一页上，你看？就在这一页上。马太福音 5 章那段就放不下。还有别的原因，但这是原因之一。

所以，“关系”是第一个主题。

一听到“关系”这个词，你马上会想到友谊、爱情、婚姻、浪漫。当然，这里的一切都适用于这些，尤其适用于婚姻。“爱你们的仇敌。善待咒诅你们的人。”好吧？也就是说——你知道吗，我甚至都来不及展开这点，尽管这很有趣——如果这是上帝要求我们对待敌对之人的方式，那么很明显，他也期望我们在友情和婚姻里这样做。

他不可能期望我们对街坊邻里的人做得比对亲近的人更多。

不过，这段经文的主要目的并不是讲友谊和爱情关系。主要目的其实是讲：我们与“朋友圈之外”的人的关系。

因此你若仔细看，耶稣一开始就给了三种情况：他立刻谈到三类人（或三群人），并告诉我们他期望怎样的行为。

我们来看看他所呼召的是什么，然后我们会立刻震惊、恼火，然后不得不说：好吧，我们怎么可能做到？

第一类人，是那些反对你的人：对你不利的人、与你为敌的人、伤害过你的人。所以我们看到：“爱你们的仇敌”“恨你们的人”“咒诅你们的人”——“恨”和“咒诅”的意思是他们希望你遭殃；还有“凌辱你们的人”“打你脸的人”——这些都是对你作恶的人。

耶稣说：我要你爱他们、关心他们、为他们祷告、站在他们那边（pull for them）。尽可能地，对他们行善。

这是第一类。

第二类不是伤害你的人，而是比你更不幸的人。

你看，这里有一个倾向：当经文说“有人夺你的外衣，连里衣也由他拿去”，人容易把这句话与前一句连起来，这样看起来好像在说：当有人抢劫你时，你说：“哦，对了，我的保险箱就在那幅画后面。”

但其实这句话在语法与逻辑上是与后面连在一起的：“凡求你的，就给他；有人夺你的东西去，不用再要回来。你们愿意人怎样待你们，你们也要怎样待人。”

你看，“你们愿意人怎样待你们，你们也要怎样待人”。如果这里讲的是抢劫，就不合适了，对吧？

它听起来会变成：“当你抢劫别人时，你希望别人怎么对待你？”显然不是。

它不可能是在说那个。

相反，“夺（take）”和“求（ask）”在这里是同义词，就像“恨、咒诅、凌辱”在上文里是同义词一样。它的意思是：当有人来，说“我有需要”，你应该毫无保留地慷慨。

Earl Ellis（写过一本很棒的路加福音注释，我会引用他几次）对这段经文这样说。他说，这里“凡求你的就给他”，甚至“外衣、里衣都给”的意思，不是说基督在此提倡对穷人做敷衍的施舍，甚至不是提倡做很大的捐赠。

听好：他说，基督在这里要求的是一种道德关切——这种关切会在每一次人生遭遇中，以“自我克制/自我舍弃”（self-denial）的灵表现出来；并且，这是为了上帝的国。

他说：一种自我舍弃的灵，要成为你生命里每一次相遇的一部分。

这是什么意思？意思是：你对那些比你少的人如此在意，以至于你连去买一把椅子都不会不想到他们。你会说：好，我要去买椅子，但我得确保我买椅子的方式，使我仍然有钱可以施舍。

它会影响你生命的每一部分——不只是“外衣”，连“里衣”都在其中。

这是一种说法：你生命的每一个方面都要以“普遍的慷慨”（promiscuous generosity）为导向。你从来不会不去想它。

这不是说：“嗯，每次有人来募捐，或有人到办公室求助，我都挺慷慨的。”这里要求的远远超过那种程度。

所以，第一类是伤害过你的人。第二类是比你更不幸的人。

第三类更微妙：与我们不同、也对我们冷漠的人。

你看后面这段：“你们若爱那爱你们的人……若善待那善待你们的人……若借给人指望收回……”他在说什么？然后他说：“就是罪人也这样。”

再往下看更明显：“因为他恩待那忘恩的和作恶的。”看见了吗？那一段里的人就是“忘恩的”和“作恶的”。

我这样说：每个人都这样。

比如说，你属于某个政治立场——保守也好自由也好。若你在中间，也许不算，因为你不觉得自己属于某个阵营。

再比如说种族。若你是盎格鲁裔，在盎格鲁裔占主导的社会里，你可能没那么强烈地意识到自己的种族；但如果你是非裔、拉丁裔或亚裔，你更可能意识到种族。

无论你是谁，都有一种倾向：看见“另一群人”——在那边——不是你这一群。

在最好的情况下，你并不太尊重他们；在最坏的情况下，你觉得他们就是社会问题。

你可能会说：但我认识其中一些人；我对他们也很友好，其中一些也算我的朋友；我在办公室、在工作场合会见到他们；或者我和他们一些人一起上过学。

我认识他们——然而，他们基本上“很不一样”。他们不像你。你其实觉得他们在很多方面有点怪，甚至你根本不尊重他们。

你也许会对他们保持礼貌，但你不会“为他们做”。你不会行善。你不会为他们付上代价。

你不会打开家门；你不会打开钱袋；你不会打开你的心；你不会打开你的生活。

你只跟“像你的人”混在一起——你尊重的人。

耶稣走过来说：当然，每个人都这样。这就是他这段话的要点。绝对每个人都这样。

他在跟某些人说话。当他在这里用“罪人”这个词时——你看见“罪人”吗？为什么有引号？为什么是引用？耶稣通常只在引用里用“罪人”这个词。

为什么？记得路加福音 15 章：法利赛人说，“他与罪人一同吃饭”。他们所谓的“罪人”，指的是不敬虔、不道德的人：妓女、税吏、与罗马合作的人等等。

耶稣不那样用这个词。他不把世界分成“罪人”和“那些好宗教人”。

所以这一定意味着：他是在对那些会那样用这个词的人说话。

他对他们说：你表面上说“我是宗教人，他们不是”；但实际上每个人都在做同一件事：你走进一个房间，环顾四周，然后问：这些是“我的人”吗？我想待在这里吗？我想跟他们来往吗？他们会让我以我想要的方式看待自己吗？

耶稣说：每个人都这样。

假设你是一个世俗的人。你走进房间，环顾四周，看见一些看起来不够酷、不够老练、不够成功的人；你努力保持身材、穿得体面，而他们看起来有点邋遢……你可以忍受他们一会儿，但你不会向他们敞开。因为这些人不能让你以你想要的方式看待自己。

你走进房间会问：这些人能让我在社交上“往上走”吗？能让我被我想被接纳的那群人接纳吗？这些人能让我在心理上“往上走”吗？让我以我想要的方式看待自己吗？

如果这些人没有你以为自己至少努力要拥有的那种酷，那种名望，那种“体面”（pulled together），那种成就，那种外表——你就会找机会离开那个房间。

耶稣说：好吧，那宗教人是不是不一样？不是。

宗教人进来，环顾四周。宗教人非常需要觉得自己“挺好”，因为所有宗教人深处都迫切需要“我很不错”的确据。

为什么？因为他们的整个身份建立在“我是好人”这个观念上：如果我活得够好，如果我遵行登山宝训，如果我把一切都做对，上帝就会爱我。

但你永远不知道自己是否“够好”。所以你极度需要一种确据：你是。

于是你走进房间，看看人，然后说：这些是“我的人”吗？这些是正直体面的人吗？这些人会帮助我被我需要被接纳的人接纳吗？这样我才能觉得自己还好吗？这些人能让我觉得我是个好人，我的观念正确、信念正确、教义正确、做法正确吗？

耶稣说：你们都一样。

所以耶稣不是在对比“两种”方式，他是在对比“三种”。他说：罪人是这样做的，宗教人是这样做的，而基督徒必须跟两者都不一样。

他说：我知道每个人在表面上都会礼貌地尊重那些与自己不同、自己并不太尊重、甚至觉得是“他者”的人——但你们要不一样。

耶稣的基督徒会给，会行善，会借给人；会打开他们的心，会打开他们的生活；会刻意寻找机会，尽可能为那些与你截然不同的人做事——做那些别人只会为“自己人”做的事。

所以耶稣是在说：对敌人，你要用爱与饶恕对待；对比你更不幸的人，你要这样对待；对那些与你不同、对你冷漠的人——你认为他们“忘恩、作恶”的人——你也要这样对待。

耶稣说：这就是我要你们过的生活。

我们先停一下。

许多宗教在这些方面也有很多伦理教导；但所有人都承认：当耶稣开始说“爱你们的仇敌”，当他开始说“过一种毫无保留的慷慨生活”，当他说“我要你们——在地上——成为一群人，刻意地、带着爱、毫无轻视地去与那些与你完全不同的人分享并服事他们”，他就像是突破了闸口、冲破了堤岸。

他甚至说到一个地步：在某种意义上，他在这里说的是——你成为基督徒的标记、区分基督徒与宗教人和非宗教人的东西，是你对“与你截然不同的人”的态度。

你会不会对他们摆出优越感？

又或者，对那些与你为敌的人：你会不会以牙还牙？还是你带着不自高的心饶恕他们、服事他们？

耶稣说：这就是我们知道你属于我的方式。

你是否想在今年夏天在信心上成长？或者你是否希望帮助初信者或孩子掌握基督信仰的核心？对我们许多人来说，夏季会提供更多时间，让我们加深信心，更理解跟随基督意味着什么。

一个很好的资源，是《新城要理问答灵修本：上帝的真理给我们的心思意念》（New City Catechism Devotional: God’s Truth for Our Hearts and Minds）。这本灵修把基督教会历史上的要理问答带到今天：每一周提供一个要思考的问题。

在序言里，Tim Keller 为“要理教育”（catechesis）提出论证：那是一种丰富、也群体性的操练——学习并背诵问答，以框定基督信仰的基础信念。

每一周包含一段经文、一篇祷告和一段简短默想，会挑战你、也鼓舞你。

书中评注来自当代牧者，如 John Piper、Tim Keller、Kevin D. Young，也包括历史人物，如 Augustine、John Calvin、Martin Luther。

本月，除了《新城要理问答灵修本》之外，我们还会附送一本很好的配套资源——《新城要理问答（儿童版）》——作为我们对你奉献的感谢；你的奉献将帮助 Gospel in Life 把基督之爱的盼望分享给全世界的人。

下面是 Tim Keller 今天信息的剩余部分。

我猜人们第一反应会说：第一，A，我做不到；第二，B，就算我做得到，这听起来也像自杀，对吧？人会说：这在我里面是不可能的；就算可能，这也像是……你知道，等于自毁。

好，简单说，这段经文里塞了很多东西。简要地说，耶稣讲了三件事，好像他早就知道人会这么说一样。他说：我来告诉你难处在哪里；我来告诉你需要怎样的内在动力；然后我给你一些方向。

难处（difficulty）、动力（dynamic）和方向（directions）。就是这样。

第一，他说：最基本的难处是什么？

他三次说：“你若只爱那些爱你的人，有什么……（what credit is that）？”或者他说：“你若只善待那善待你们的人，有什么……？”

他三次都说：“有什么……？”

这句话读起来有点含糊，甚至有点暧昧。

“有什么功劳？”功劳在谁那里？

我们用的 NIV 译本刻意保持模糊；也应该保持模糊，因为这里很有意思，充满含义，而且我认为基本上是多维度的。

耶稣实际上在说什么？字面上我告诉你他在说什么。

他说：你若只爱那些爱你的人——他说：“哪里有恩典（grace）在其中？”因为这里译为“功劳/可酬谢”（credit）的词，是新约里表示“恩典”的词——charis，就是那表示“不配得之爱”（unmerited love）的词。

当他说：“如果你只爱那些爱你的人，那里面的不配得之爱在哪里？”

这听起来有点怪，但他在说两件事。

第一，他说：当你只爱“自己人”，不爱“他者”；当你只爱那些给你情绪回报或社交回报的人——他们在社交上帮到你，或在自尊上给你支撑——你要小心。

想想看：宗教人常常看起来像是在服事麻烦的人、需要帮助的人，他们看起来像在做这件事；但为什么？你为什么这么做？

是不是为了你能说：“我知道上帝爱我，因为看看我是什么样的人”？

若是这样，耶稣就在说：当你为了回报才去爱，你不是“爱得不够好”，你根本没有在爱。

耶稣说：别看我的标准，然后说：“我也爱人，只是没爱到那程度。”耶稣说：如果你爱人是因为他们能使你得利，那你根本不是在爱他们——你爱的是他们给你的东西；你爱的是你的自我；你是在利用他们来满足自我。

你不是为他们的缘故爱他们，而是为你自己的缘故。

你根本没有在爱。这里没有爱。

A 这个人很酷，B 那个人邋遢、很消耗你。你更爱 A 而不是 B。为什么？这跟他们无关，跟你有关。

天哪，你可能被一个人吸引、对一个人有迷恋，但那根本不是关于他们，是关于你：如果这样长相、这样社会地位、这样外表的人也喜欢我，我就知道“我算个什么”。

耶稣说：这里根本没有爱，因为你爱的基础是：他们对你自尊的“价值”。

所以第一，他在说：你的爱并不是爱。

第二，他说：这就是你为什么会“亏空”（in deficit）。

如果你只爱那些爱你的人，你里面的爱在哪里？他的意思很简单。

想想投资银行家——你们当中有人就是。好吧。假设你手头特别宽裕，不只是“有钱”，而是“有一大堆钱”。我们不说你是投行，我们说你是投资人，你手头富得流油。你面前有很多投资机会。

当你富得流油，你可以看一个项目说：我喜欢这个新事业，我愿意投资，为什么？因为我喜欢这个产品，因为我觉得它对人有益，因为我喜欢创业者的态度。即便我不知道它一定成功，但我喜欢，所以我投。

但如果你是一个“喘不过气的投资人”（an investor sucking air）呢？如果你资金紧张、麻烦很大呢？如果你说：我下一笔必须赚一大笔——那对不起，你投钱就不是看产品好不好，也不是看你喜不喜欢创业者；你只能投到“能给你回报”的地方。

耶稣基督说：在“爱”这件事上，地上每一个人都是那个喘不过气的投资人。

你对“我是谁”没有把握，你对自己没有把握——这就是你为什么在“我爱谁、我跟谁约会”上做出那么多区分。

我说的不只是友谊、恋爱；我也在说：你和谁来往、你跟谁坐在一起、你花时间跟谁在一起、你在街上与人交谈会投入多少时间与多少真心——这一切，耶稣说，都取决于你心里发生了什么。

因为你是亏空的，你根本没有在爱；你是在把爱投给任何能给你所需回报的人。

这就是问题。

因为那里面的“爱之亏空”、那里面的“恩典之亏空”，若你要能给出不配得之爱，你就必须先经历不配得之爱；你必须经历一片海洋的不配得之爱。

这就是难处。

那么动力是什么？

动力就在末尾。请快速仔细看。

首先，我要读 Earl Ellis 的话。耶稣说：“你们的赏赐就必大了；你们也必作至高者的儿子，因为他恩待那忘恩的和作恶的。”

如果你能抓住这节经文，如果你相信它、认识它、明白它，并把它放在你生命的中心，你就会有一种动力，使你开始走出去，做耶稣基督所说的事。

你会想去做；你也会真的能够开始迈步。

如果你不相信这节，如果你不明白其中所含的，那么耶稣呼召你的一切，充其量是不可能的，往坏里说是危险的胡话。

但如果你明白其中是什么——有两点。

第一，它说：你们是父的儿女。

Earl Ellis 在路加福音注释里说：你必须很小心，因为按英文译文读出来，好像是：如果我去爱，我就会成为上帝的儿子，对吧？它说“then you will be”，听起来像是“那样你就会变成”。但希腊文的语气完全不是这个意思。

他说：这是对门徒说的——对那些“上帝已经是你们的父”的人说的。

耶稣在这里做的，是邀请门徒在他们的伦理生活中，把他们与上帝关系的意义“实现出来”。

你们蒙召去成为你们已经是的样子。

这意味着：基督徒必须明白：我被收养了（adopted）。什么是收养？

约翰福音 1:12，保罗在加拉太书 4 章说：虽然每个人都是上帝的受造物，因此被上帝所爱、所看重，但我们被收养为儿女，是一个恩典的作为。

收养意味着非常重要的事。在当时，如果一个富人（男人或女人）没有孩子，他们很常见的做法是：收养另一个成人，那人就成为他们的继承人。

而在收养发生的那一刻（这就是新约理解我们与上帝关系的背景）：

收养首先是一种“法律上的恩典”。你可能一文不名，但当收养文件盖章的一瞬间，你甚至还没做任何事去挣它，你就立刻、自动地变成富有——就身份、法律地位而言，瞬间改变。

第二，你不只有财富，你还有一种新的亲密。这个伟大的人不再是你的 CEO，不再是你的首相；这个人是你的父。

这意味着亲密，也意味着关系的永久性：父亲对孩子的爱，常常在孩子做错时反而更强。

也意味着可亲近性：你不能凌晨两点打给 CEO 或首相要一杯水——那不合宜；但儿子或女儿可以。

所以，这里假设你已经在这种关系里：你明白吗？你明白天上地下的主是你的父，你是凭恩典被收养的吗？

尽管你是什么样的人，你在他里面是富足的；你被永久地爱；你被无条件地爱；你被全面地爱——这是前提。

我现在不能展开讲完。我不会在这里把“收养”全讲清楚；这段经文不解释收养，它假设收养。

你必须明白：这是第一点。你要得到那种动力，第一件事就是：你是否被收养？你明白那是什么意思吗？那是否是你最根本的身份？那是否真是你一切的源头？

第二点，它说：“因为他恩待那忘恩的和作恶的。”

你看，“忘恩的和作恶的”与前面一切是平行的。换句话说，耶稣在这里说：我要你像你们的父，因为他向他的仇敌施恩；他向他的仇敌施恩。那么这些仇敌是谁？

哇——是我们。

这就是炸药。

我告诉你：如果你能点燃这炸药，如果你能把引线点着——方法是这样：基督徒认识自己是一个“被收养的仇敌”。被收养的仇敌。

两件事：一方面，你曾是仇敌。

宗教人和非宗教人都不认为自己是上帝的仇敌。我没有时间，也不是在这里（因为这段经文不展开解释）把其中机制全说明白。

但大致是这样：宗教人从不觉得自己是上帝的仇敌；他们说“我那么努力，我努力像上帝，我尽力把一切做好。”非宗教人说“我不在乎，或者我很难相信”，但他们也不认为自己是上帝的仇敌。

而你知道自己是基督徒、你与上帝的关系根基在恩典而不是在表现、成就和善行上的标志之一，是你已经明白：你是仇敌。

这意味着：你曾经厌恶他对你生命每一寸的主权宣告；你甚至看见：连你努力做个好人，都常常是在试图控制上帝，让他不得不为你做事。

基督徒会说：我是仇敌，但我被收养。

当你把这两件事放在一起，这段经文里的一切就会流出来。

为什么？你会说：好吧，概念上挺有意思。可是你必须用它融化你的心。

你在哪里看见上帝真正“恩待那忘恩的和作恶的”？在十字架上。

因为在十字架上，你看见他被咒诅，却在祝福；你看见他被凌辱，却在祷告——正如耶稣所要求的。

耶稣不是只在说：“你要这样。”

他也不是只在说：“你要这样，因为我就是这样。”

他在说：“你要这样，因为我将要为你这样。”

当那发生——当你看见他这样爱你——我要问：耶稣爱你，使他的社会地位得了什么？

耶稣不只是从你身上得不到任何回报，他还无限地下沉：他从天到地；正如那首诗歌所说，他从地到坟墓。他一路下到底。

再问：耶稣基督从你得到了什么——不是社会意义上，而是心理意义上？对他的自尊有什么帮助？

“他使那无罪的，替我们成为罪。”

看：耶稣基督看着你，因你这个人而爱你。

他不但没有从你得到你在关系里想要得到的东西，他得到的恰恰相反。

除非你同时看见：一方面你如此失丧，以至于他必须为你死；另一方面你如此被爱，以至于他必须为你死。

当你把这吸收进去，看见他这样做，你终于得着“爱之亏空”“不配得之爱之亏空”的答案。

然后你望向外面，看见人，你会说：无论他们多破碎，我也曾破碎；无论他们多错谬，看他们那么多错误观点——我也曾错谬。

即便他们对你敌对——我也曾对他敌对；就在他向我伸手时，我还在恼怒。

在某种意义上，人类在他为我们死时仍在嘲笑亚当（或嘲笑人子）。

当这一切进入你的心，你就再也不会一样。

接下来是方向：这在实际中到底带来什么不同？

两件事：第一，“转过另一边脸”；第二，“饶恕”。

你会说：“转过另一边脸”，这不正是问题吗？这听起来非常不切实际。

哦，真的吗？想一想。

首先，看 27-28 节：这是非常有名的段落。“爱你们的仇敌”“为他们祷告”“转过另一边脸”。听起来像是在说：你可以尽情踩我、再打我一巴掌——我还活着呢。

听着：第一，注意那个“但”（but）。

“但”表示对比。它在对比什么？

我们三周前读过：在路加福音版本一开始，耶稣说：“贫穷的人有福了……哀哭的人有福了……被拒绝的人有福了……富足的人有祸了……掌权的人有祸了……”记得吗？耶稣在呼吁公义。

耶稣说：我们必须反对不义，我们要对抗不义；但是你必须转过另一边脸。

你会说：等一下，你怎么能一方面说要反对不义，一方面又说要转过另一边脸？

看看这是什么意思。

先问：为什么打人脸？是为了把他打晕？为了抢他？不是。

你不需要是武术专家。如果你想把人打晕，你会打太阳神经丛，会踢脚。

为什么要扇人脸？是为了侮辱他。

那为什么要转过另一边脸？

即便在我们的社会里（女人做得比男人多一点，但我们仍然这样做）：每次我去看我姐姐或嫂子们，如果我带家人去看他们家，他们出来会怎么样？

我姐姐会这样——嗨——她在做什么？她想让我亲她一下。她在问候我，她希望我也这样问候她。

耶稣在说什么？

他说：我要你反对不义，但我要你反对不义时，里面不要有那种“自我”的敏感，不要因为“我的面子”被触碰。你被侮辱了——那又怎样？

他说：我要你反对不义，但你不要出去扇回去。

你反对不义，是为了公义本身。

你反对不义，也是出于对施暴者的爱——让一个人继续行不义、继续犯罪，从来都不是爱。

你反对不义，也是为了周围的人。

你为公义的缘故、为那人的缘故、为别人的缘故去反对；你永远不是为了：“我要让那个人难受，我要让他知道他错了。”

换句话说，耶稣说：不要玩这种“打脸”的事。

这正好跟你我相反。

耶稣说：我要你直接、勇敢、公开地说：“你做错了。”但在你里面，你已经饶恕了他。

为什么？

因为你有情感上的谦卑——你是仇敌；也因为你有情感上的富足——你被收养。

你没有什么要证明的，因为你知道自己也是罪人。

你有情感上的谦卑：你知道自己是罪人；但你也有情感上的富足：看我在耶稣里得着了什么。

所以无论那个人从我这里夺走了什么——名誉也好——无论他对我做了什么，那都不是我最重要的东西。耶稣才是最重要的。

因此，因为你里面已经饶恕，你里面的骄傲也没有被刺得发炎，你就可以带着从容（poise）去面对那个人，没有太多怨恨、没有太多报复与毒液。

你会说出真话，但心里却是平安。

可我们不是这么做的。

当有人伤害我们，我们什么也不说；我们说“我不想把事情弄僵”。但里面却在被骄傲烧着。

耶稣说：我要你相反——相反。

你能做到。

实际应用太多了。

我们是一间教会，对吧？为什么在这个群体里——在某种程度上——那些没有最好工作、没有最好身材的人，常常会感到被排斥，就像在外面的世界一样？这必须停止。

第二，你们当中许多人需要在你自己先处理内心、先饶恕之后，开始去对那些伤害你的人讲真话——为了他们的益处去找他们谈。

你知道吗？胜过不义的唯一方式，是不 bitter（不苦毒）。因为如果你对别人对你做的事苦毒，他们就把你变成他们那样的人——他们仍在控制你。

真正胜过不义的唯一方式，是彻底饶恕它，然后带着某种喜乐去反对它。

你们当中有些人，有人需要你去谈。

最后，耶稣就是那位好撒玛利亚人。

他是真正的好邻舍。

我为什么把这篇信息叫作“邻里的爱”（Love in the Neighborhood）？我告诉你为什么：因为当你说“爱邻舍”时，它太模糊、太像口号。人会想：那到底是什么意思？我告诉你那是什么意思。

耶稣说：你的邻舍，就是任何与你同在上帝绿色大地上的人。

所以如果你是基督徒，看看你周围的邻里：你是否忽略他们、只追逐基督徒？你认识你的邻居吗？任何在那里的人，耶稣基督说：你需要像对待我一样对待他们。

去找他们；刻意寻找理由，为你所在街区的共同福祉出力。

因为当耶稣讲好撒玛利亚人的比喻时，他是在说：“我告诉你谁是你的邻舍。”

他说：有个犹太人倒在路上；一个撒玛利亚人走过来。那犹太人浑身是血，倒在路上；撒玛利亚人走过来——而他们彼此仇恨。

耶稣基督也完全可以这样说：一个三 K 党头目倒在路上流血，一个非裔美国人走过来。

他也可以说：一个塞尔维亚人倒在路上，一个科索沃人走过来。

他也可以说：一个纳粹倒在路上流血将死，一个犹太人走过来。

他要说的是：任何出现在你路上的人，现在就是你的邻舍，因为对我来说，你就是“任何人”。看我为你做了什么。

你要资源去做社会公义？你要资源去拆毁隔阂？没有什么能像这个一样。

但如果你要成为邻舍，首先你需要有一位邻舍。

你必须看见：耶稣基督就是那位走过来的邻舍；而你是倒在路上的那个人。

比喻怎么说？他俯身下来，把你放到他原本的位置上。

他把你放在他的坐骑上，自己走在地上。

这就是耶稣所做的：你倒在路上，他把你扶起，把他的地位给你；把他的身份给你；把他的义给你；把他的位分给你；他取了我们的位分。

除非你被他赐下的怜悯所震撼，你就永远不会被赋能去提供他所要求的怜悯。

我们来祷告。

我们感谢你，主，赐下这样的资源。

这就是炸药。

这就像一根引线。

我们只需要把它点着。

现在求你帮助我们点着它。
