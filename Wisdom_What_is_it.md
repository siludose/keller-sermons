Welcome to the Gospel Unliked Podcast. Many of the questions we face in life are complex and aren't always answered by simply following  rules. Do I speak up now or do I wait? Should I take that job or say where I am? That's why wisdom is so crucial.

But how do we develop it? Today join us as Tim Keller explores how we apply God's wisdom to the everyday complexities  of our lives.

Today's scripture reading is from the Book of Proverbs 1-9-22-32-33. The Proverbs of Solomon, Son of David, King of Israel, for gaining wisdom and instruction,  for understanding words of insight, for receiving instruction in prudent behavior, doing  what is right and just and fair, for giving prudence to those who are simple, knowledge and  discretion to the young, let the wise listen and add to their learning and let the discerning  get guidance. For understanding Proverbs and parables, the sayings and riddles of the wise, the fear  of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. Listen, my son, to your father's instruction and do not forsake your mother's teaching,  they are a garland to grace your head and a chain to adorn your neck. How long will you who are simple love your simple ways?

How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge? For the waywardness of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy  them. But whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease without fear of harm. The word of the Lord, thanks be to God. So for the first three weeks here after Labor Day, we're going to do a real short series  on the very first chapters of the book of Proverbs, which is the number one book in the Bible  about wisdom.

Now, if you live in New York City, one of the things that you see are choices, they're  just zillions and zillions of choices. One of the reasons for that is that, excuse me, one of the reasons for that is that is  a density, you know, in the rest of the country there's 90 people per square mile living.  90 people per square mile living in the rest of America. In Manhattan, there's 60,000 people per square mile. So if you have expert, and that means more than just more restaurants, it means which  is, you know, I don't know where to go to eat, where to go to eat. But you have all these other choices, should I stay in the business I'm in, should I get  into a new career, should I stay with this company, should I move into the company, should  I go into business for myself, should I go to grad school, where will I work after  school, should I marry this person or not, all the deals, all the collaborations, all  the partnerships, because it's dense here, there's all these choices to make.

And you know what, if you don't make good choices, it can be very destructive. Bad choices blow up on you. Every choice is like a fork in a road and once you make it, you really can't go back to  where you were. And if you make the wrong choice, you never really in a sense can go back. So what does it take to make good choices, especially in a place like New York to live  is to make good choices?

What does it take? It takes wisdom, and the book of Proverbs is perhaps the most famous texts in the world. Millions of people, for thousands of years have looked to it for help and we're going  to look for just three weeks at ourselves. Now if we take a look at the very first few verses of the book, we're going to see the basics  and what do we have here? What wisdom is, why it's important, why it's a problem, and where to get it, okay?

What wisdom is, why it's important, why it's a problem, and where you can find it. First of all, let's look at what wisdom is. And right off the bat, look at verse 1 and 2, it says, these are the Proverbs of Solomon  for gaining wisdom. But what's the word wisdom mean? Well, one of the best ways to figure out what it means is to look at the synonyms.

Look at the other words that are used to describe wisdom right there in those first sentences. One of the synonyms is the word insight. Do you see this? For gaining wisdom, that's the first part of verse 2. And for understanding words of insight, what's insight?

It's a Hebrew word, the word binaw, and it's a word that actually means to notice differences,  to see, find distinctions that other people can't see. Ever notice when a master detective walks into a crime scene, the master detective sees  20 or 30 clues, and everybody else has just got two, but that's insight. But by the way, insight doesn't just mean noticing 20 things when other people only see one or two. It also means to imagine wisdom in insight means to imagine 20 or 30 things where other people  can only imagine one or two. If somebody says, well, I'm in this situation and there's only two things I can do.

And an insightful person says, no, no, you got about 15 things that you could do. And here they are, and breaks it down. So wisdom is insight. It's the ability to see distinctions where other people can see a blur. Secondly, you have the word prudence.

You see that? This is verse 3 and 4. For receiving instruction in prudent behavior, verse 4, for giving prudence to those who are simple. And the word prudence is, it translates a Hebrew word, that means practical. It means to know strategic.

It means to know how to actually get things done, how to make a goal into reality,  not just to talk about it, but to actually bring it into reality. Or another way to say it, wise people are not just characterized by insight, but also by foresight. They don't just diagnose the problem. They also know how to solve it. And then third, by the way, is the word instruction.

It's, notice it says in verse 2, for gaining wisdom and instruction,  it's a kind of strange English word to translate a Hebrew word that means character, depth of character. Now, let's pull them all together. What is wisdom? One Old Testament scholar, Garhard von Rod, who knew all about the wisdom literature of the Bible said this. Wisdom, according to the Bible, is competence with regard to the realities of life.

Competence with regard to how life really works, really works. So, for example, is wisdom knowledge? Well, wisdom assumes knowledge. If you don't know anything about a subject, you can't be wise about a subject. So, you can't be wise unless you know, but you can obviously know a lot about a subject and be stupid.

Because wisdom is knowing what to do with the knowledge, how to practically use it. Or put it like this. Is wisdom the same thing as being good and moral, following the rules. Now, according to the Bible, if God made the universe, and He did,  so if there's a God who made the universe, and you disobey Him, you're not just being,  it's not, to disobey the God who made the universe is not just wrong, it's stupid. I mean, if there's a God who made the universe and you disobey Him, it's not just wrong, it's dumb.

It's not going to work. And so, according to the Bible, wisdom assumes that you're good, assumes that you're following the moral rules. But it is quite possible to be very moral and still be stupid. And you know why? So, wisdom is not less than being good.

It's more, but wisdom is not, it's more than just following the moral rules, you know why? Wisdom is knowing what the right thing is to do in the 80% of life situations to which the moral rules don't directly apply. Like if somebody comes and says, well, I've got these two jobs, okay, I'm a Christian, I've got these two jobs. What does the Bible tell me? Well, if I was filled with moral rules, and they're both okay, it wouldn't be a sin to take either job.

And yet, if you take the wrong job, it'll be a disaster. So, you see why you can be very moral, you can be following all the moral rules,  and it's still not another right thing to do in the 80% of life situations to which the moral rules don't directly apply. So, wisdom is, you've got to be knowledgeable and you've got to be good to be wise, but you can be both good and wise and still be really dumb. Wisdom is competence with regard to the realities of life, it's competence with regard to how life really works. That's the first point, that's what it is.

Now, he begins to see why it's so important, because down here in verse 32, it says,  for the waywardness of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them. Now, that's saying that people without wisdom, the simple and the fools, are not just simply, it's not just unfortunate if you don't have wisdom. It'll kill you. It'll literally kill you. Why?

Well, let's take a look at this for a minute. First of all, let's look at these two words, the simple and the fool. Now, these are two Hebrew words, and they're used throughout the book of Proverbs. The simple is a word that means young naive people who are too unruited and unformed to make smart decisions because they're going with a crowd. And by the way, those of, I got to be careful here, I always put this, this is a particular form of foolishness that young people fall into.

What is it? Notice it says, the waywardness of the simple will kill them. Wayward means to go off the road, and the thing that often really harms us when we're young is we care so much what our friends think. I mean, to be a teenager or young adult, the people that you like to have them think you're not cool, it's the worst thing in the world. And because young people are so incredibly affected by what their friends think, they'll very often go off the road.

They'll be wayward because they're too concerned with what people think. They're too affected by what people think. Instead of doing the wise thing, they'll do the popular thing. And you're looking back, there are so many choices that people made when they were in this, this simpleton form. You look back on your younger years, you say, why did I ever think that would work?

Why did I think I would get away with it? Why did I think I wouldn't be found out was because I was blinded by the crowd I was with. And so that's one, the waywardness of the simple will kill you. But the other name, the other word, a fool. This is a Hebrew word that actually means almost the opposite kind of foolishness.

Why? Well, the fool is a person who is wise in his own eyes. That's the characteristic of the fool in the book of problems. And you see a simple fool, you might say, a simpleton, is a young person who is too concerned about what people think. Whereas a fool, according to the book of problems, is somebody who doesn't care enough what other people think.

That is, he's wise in his own eyes. By the way, just because it's so hard to go, he, she, he, she, whenever you talk about fools, you're going to talk about he. But I just want you to know, those of you who art, he's, it could be you. I just like, it could be you. But anyway, the fool, he's wise in his own eyes and he's sat in his ways.

And here's a bunch of synonyms that one old Testament professor put in his commentary. A fool is self-right, just opinionated, stubborn, hard to persuade, gets his back up when if you try to correct them, and despises his correction. Now, their opposites. The simple ton is a person to conserve what people think. Whereas the fool is a person who's not concerned enough.

They don't, the fools are people who don't listen to what others say, you can't talk to them, they're sat in their ways, they're sure they know. But they're both out of touch with reality. See, if wisdom is, competence with regard to reality, wisdom does the thing in the situation that fits with reality as God has made it, basically. God made the world in a certain way, it's God's world, it's also a broken world because of sin. And a wise person figures sees the created brokenness of the reality and says, what is the wisest thing to do?

Simpletons aren't in touch with reality, they're in touch with their friends. Fools are not in touch with reality, they're in touch with their own pride, their own dignity, they're sure they know. But what it takes to be wise is to be in touch with reality and fools whether they're too open to what other people say or not open enough are not in touch with reality. So, for example, here you have a situation, a really difficult situation and you're in it with people and here's the question, should I speak out, should I open my mouth, should I just tell them everything, should I confront or should let it go. Should I let it be, should I not say anything?

Now, both of those things are perfectly right. As we go through the book of Proverbs, you're going to see that there's two Proverbs that are almost back to back. And I think it's in chapter 25 and it goes like this, answer a fool according to his folly, or he'll be wise in his own eyes, like the next verse is, don't answer a fool in his folly,  because he'll despise you. So, you read it and you say, okay, which is it eyes? See, we don't know, Christians do not know how to read the book of Proverbs because we look at the book of Proverbs as if it's a bunch of rules, but it's not a bunch of rules.

It's about wisdom, it's about how life actually works and those two Proverbs next to each other are not contradictions. What it's trying to say is, sometimes you ought to confront a fool and sometimes you shouldn't. And a wise person knows the difference. Now, here's the problem. Almost all of us are not in touch with reality enough to know when to do and when not to.

Why? Point three. Point three is, here's why wisdom is such a problem. Some years ago, I read a really great article in the Atlantic Monthly with an interview with Drom Kagan. Drom Kagan taught for many years at Harvard.

He's retired in long retired. He's still alive, I believe. But he was like the child psychologist of his time, later on that's called developmental psychology, very, very respected, brilliant man. And in the article, he was being interviewed and he said that across 36 cultures now, with thousands and thousands and thousands of people studied. He says, we now know that I'm paraphrasing it, but paraphrasing it, that neurochemistry creates three basic, habitual reactions to threats.

So every one of us, no matter what the culture, there's three different ways that our neurochemistry has wired us to respond to danger or a threat or a problem. He says, some people are wired for what he calls, some are anxious, some are aggressive and some are philosophical. He says, the anxious people, basically you're wired to instinctively say, let me out of here. When there's a threat, you say, just cut your losses, just get out, just go. He says the aggressive is when there's a problem, you say, let me get in there and deal with it.

You know, I'm gonna get it before it gets me, that's the aggressive part. So he says, anxious people tend to be pessimistic, this is never gonna work, just leave. Aggressive people tend to be optimistic and say, I can handle this, get in there and try to deal with it. The philosophical are wired to say something like this. Just calm down.

Let's not do anything rash. No use getting bent out of shape. Let's wait and see. Now, Kagan goes on and says, do you realize that we're all wired for one of those responses? One of those responses feels right.

Feels absolutely right. Feels wise to you. It happens instinctively, it feels like the best thing to do. You do it almost without thinking. But he says, you realize that in most situations, your habitual response is inappropriate.

He says anxious people are best in situations where danger is really high. You know why? Because the only way that you're going to actually survive is without spending a lot of time thinking about it to get out. So anxious, the anxious response is the best response for highly dangerous situations. And anxious people are the people who are the most functional in that situation.

It's as aggressive people are best when it comes to mid-level danger. If the danger is kind of middle size, sometimes your confidence, I can handle this. He actually sometimes makes pays off, but even if it doesn't pay off, it won't be lethal. He says philosophical types are best in situations that look worse than they are. If you're in a situation and it's kind of looks dangerous, but actually it's not, the philosophical say, let's slow down, let's stop.

And some situations are really not that bad, but if you act evasively like the anxious person or aggressively, you can actually make it worse. And so what Kagan says is you realize that whatever seems the most natural way for you to deal with threats is usually wrong. In the exact right spot, it's perfect. But in many cases, it's inappropriate and kind of dysfunctional. In some cases, it's absolutely lethal.

Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer? Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith? For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding of what it means to follow Christ. A great resource to start using this summer is the new city catechism devotional, God's truth for our hearts and minds. This devotional brings the historic catechisms of the Christian Church to life, offering a question to consider for each week of the year.

In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catechesis, the rich and communal practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers that frame the foundational beliefs of the Christian faith. Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer, and a brief meditation that will challenge and inspire you. The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller, and Kevin De Young, as well as historical figures such as Augustine, John Calvin, and Martin Luther. This month, in addition to the new city catechism devotional, we are including a great companion resource, the new city catechism for kids, as our thank you for your gift to help gospel-on-life share the hope of Christ's love with people all over the world. So request your copies today at gospel-on-life.com-slash-give, that's gospel-on-life.com-slash-give.

Now, here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. Now, what does that mean? And then Jerome Kagan goes on and says this, and this sounds right out of the book of Proverbs. Don't forget he was a child psychologist. He says, for the wise men of all, pardon me, modern, wrong quote, I'll get there.

It's late, and I'm old. From the article, he says, modern parents have been taught that their children need to find themselves and be themselves. But unless parents intervene, their children's natural temperament will dominate them, and they won't learn how to act wisely in situations in which their habitual temperamental response is inappropriate. Good parenting will see the dark side of their children's temperament, and will intervene showing them that they have to have a greater range of responses. Now, these are all from the article.

The point is, the aggressive have to realize you sometimes are to blame. The anxious have to realize that sometimes you aren't to blame. The philosophical have to realize that sometimes things are really terrible. So what parents need to go to with their children is they need to challenge the anxious to be bold, the bold to be anxious, the pessimistic to have hope and the chronically sunny to worry more. Now, Proverbs, I told you this head at this point, I'm trying to show you why wisdom is such a problem.

Proverbs chapter 22 verse 15 says, foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child. You know what that means? We're all naturally foolish. Jerome Kagan says so. The way we're wired automatically makes us respond in habitual ways that are often inappropriate.

They're out of touch with reality. They're in touch with our temperament. They're in touch with our opinion. They're in touch with what the crowd says, but they're not in touch with reality. And fools are people that are not in touch with reality.

And Kagan says foolishness is natural. Wisdom is acquired. If you're just yourself, you're going to be a fool. If your parents just let you be yourself, you're going to be a fool. If your friends just let yourself be yourself, you're going to be a fool.

And if you let yourself be yourself, you're going to be a fool. You see the problem it is? And he's also right in saying that unless somebody, listen, unless you learn wisdom, which takes years,  it takes years of training, it takes years of humbling yourself, it takes years of not being wise in your own eyes,  it takes years of being corrected by people and receiving correction. It takes years of being mentored, it takes years of being trained, of learning. We're going to see all this by the way in the next couple of weeks.

Years of getting to know the Word of God, getting to know God, getting to know your own heart,  it takes years and years of pushing yourself out beyond your comfort zone,  pushing yourself out beyond your natural temperament, pushing yourself out,  it takes years to develop and if you don't, you're going to be killed, you're going to be destroyed,  you're going to make bad choices and they're going to blow up on you. And also, Kagan's right, when he says, is our culture. The culture is completely against us, the culture says you need to be yourself,  the idea that you're supposed to fight against your temperament and not try to be yourself  and to learn wisdom, oh no. What the culture says is be yourself and if you've got a problem, find a technique. Now let me get to the, you see as Lewis has a quote from his book, The Abolition of Man,  which I just tried to read to you a minute ago.

And Lewis says, if you want to summarize the difference between modern times and ancient times, listen. He says, for the wise men of old, the cardinal problem had been how to conform the sold reality  and the solution was knowledge, self-discipline, and virtue. He says, that's the ancient way. The ancient way is our problem is that we are not conform to reality. How do we conform the sold reality?

And the answer is virtue and wisdom and change, change yourself. But today, he says, the problem is how to subdue reality to our wishes. That's what modern people want and the solution is a technique. So for example, plenty of Christians who consider themselves not being influenced by their culture  but being influenced by the Bible are more influenced by their culture in this area than they think. And I'll give you an example.

Over the years, I've had people so often come to me  and say, I've got a big question. I've got a choice to make. I have to choose this or this or I have to choose from this or this. And I wanted to discern God's will. I want to know what God's will is.

Well, that's very spiritual. It is. It's right. I only want to do what God wants me to do, okay? So I would like to know, when you pray, how can you tell which of the options God wants?

In other words, is there a way to pray so that I can sense God showing me? So when I pray about this or this or this or this, do I,  and I feel more peace when I'm praying about this rather than this,  is that God telling me, I mean, how do I discern God guiding me to show me what I should do? And my response to them is virtually never a very satisfying response to them at first. I hope later maybe it is. Because I always say, look, prayer is a very big part of what it means to become a wise person.

We'll talk about that again in the next couple of weeks. But I said, you know, you need it. As far as the Bible is concerned, here's how you discern God's will. You become a wise person through years of training, through learning,  through getting to know God, getting to know the Word, getting to know your own heart,  getting going through suffering, being corrected by people. You slowly, slowly, slowly become a discerning, insightful, prudent, wise person.

And then, when you've got a choice to make, choose the option that you think is best. Because when you come into me and say, well, I want to learn how in prayer I can sort of lay things out in front of God  and find out what God wants. That's a technique. That sounds very spiritual. Oh, I just want to know what God wants.

In other words, it sounds very spiritual. It's a technique. You're doing exactly what your culture wants. Not to conform the soul to reality, but to conform the reality of the soul. Not you make the change, but you find a technique that when you get into a situation,  no, actually, I haven't spent years praying.

I haven't spent years being learning correction. I haven't had years of experience. I haven't had these things. This is a technique. Do you see the problem we've got?

This is what wisdom is, being in touch with, competent with regard to realities of life. The real problem is that we're all fools by nature. And if we don't learn the wisdom to make good choices, it's going to destroy us. So, how do we find that wisdom? Now, all we can do at this point is point to the next couple of weeks,  one verse here that tells us how to begin the search.

How do you find this wisdom? Here's how it begins. It's right there. In fact, that's the word. Look at verse seven.

This is one of the most famous verses in the Bible because it's repeated over and over again. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. Okay. Here's the last thing I'm going to tell you. Here's how you find wisdom.

It's through paradoxical fear and the foolishness of grace. Paradoxical fear and the foolishness of grace. So, first of all, paradoxical fear. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge. Don't you notice how strange it is that fear here is obviously a positive thing?

You and I would think of fear as negative. In fact, there's many places in the Bible that see fear as negative. Right? The Bible says perfect love casts out fear. Fear is bad.

The Bible says God has not given us a spirit of fear. So why is the fear of the Lord here a positive kind of fear? Well, there's a negative and a positive kind of fear. Do you know what they are? There's two ways to be afraid in the presence of someone.

The first way is you're afraid if you think they may hurt you or hurt you or say something mean to you. In other words, if you distrust the person, you really distrust that person. They might say something really mean, they may do something to hurt you. So if you go into the presence of someone you really distrust, you can be kind of scared. But there's another way to go into the presence of someone to be afraid.

Right after the first Lord of the Rings movie came out,  a lot of the actors who were in the first movie were at a Barnes and Noble downtown. I think it was on... Yeah, I can't remember where it was exactly, but it was downtown somewhere. And Kathy and I went and one of the people who was there was Christopher Lee,  big tall Christopher Lee with the... You know, he placed Saruman in the Lord of the Rings and he's in his 80s now.

But he talked about one time running into when he was a younger man somewhere,  JRR Tolkien himself, whose works he just loved and revered. And he talked about the fact that he went all kind of trembling. And I raised that set and is the Christopher Lee voice. And he says, when he met Tolkien, he says, and I almost note. Now, here's the point.

When you find yourself in the presence of somebody who's so revered,  you were in such awe of... Have it ever happened to you? You just get a tremble. But it's a positive fear, it's not a negative fear. See, you can be afraid of...

The negative fear is you're afraid that somebody's going to hurt you,  because you distrust them. A positive fear is you're afraid you're going to disappoint them. You're going to dishonor them. Is it going to grieve them or something? Because you love them so much.

Because you appreciate them so much, right? The negative fear is actually selfish. I'm afraid I'm going to get hit. But the positive fear is actually all about the person. I don't want it in any way to dishonor this person or bore this person  or offend this person or certainly grieve this person.

And that is the fear of the Lord. That is a fear that is a joyful fear. It's a positive fear. It's on wonder before him. It's not being afraid he's going to condemn you.

You're afraid that he's going to hurt you? You're afraid in a sense that you're going to grieve him. If I put in a priceless Ming dynasty vase in your hands,  it was beautiful. It was thousands of years old and with worth millions of dollars,  you might get scared. Why?

Not because you're afraid it's going to hurt you. You're afraid you're going to hurt it. And the fear of the Lord is a joyful fear. It's such on wonder and such love that you don't want to grieve him  or do anything to avoid dishonoring him. Now, if you had that kind of fear,  do you realize how different that is?

How different that is from just believing in God? And do you realize that most people in the world are obeying God  out of negative fear? Negative fear is, I've got to obey God. Otherwise, he's going to hit me. But if you had the positive fear,  if you had this joyful fear,  do you realize what that would do?

It would make you wise. You know how? First of all, you wouldn't be simple. If you had this kind of relationship with God,  if God meant this to you,  if you had this sense of his love and his delight in you  and if you wanted more than anything else to give love  and delight to him,  then you wouldn't care what other people think. You wouldn't be a simpleton.

You wouldn't be wayward. You wouldn't care what other people think. This also wouldn't be an obstacle  because you wouldn't care what you think anymore. You wouldn't have that insecurity that needs to be right. You wouldn't be standing on your own dignity.

There'd be humility. There'd be an ease, there'd be an openness. The fear of the Lord, this positive joyful fear of the Lord  would be the very beginning of your wisdom. How do you get that? The only way to get it is to be absolutely sure  that God is not going to hurt you.

To be absolutely sure that in spite of your flaws, he will not condemn you. The difference between a converted person, a person with a new heart, a person who understands  the gospel, and a person who is just nuckling under, is a difference between a person with  the positive fear of God versus the negative fear of God, right? And how can you get that positive fear of God? We've got to know that there is no condemnation for you. And the only way to do that is this, put the book of Proverbs in the whole Bible, put  it in the context of the whole Bible, and in the Old Testament we know there's a negative  and positive fear, but when you get to the New Testament, we learn there's also a negative  and positive foolishness.

Negative foolishness we've been looking at, but there's a positive foolishness, St. Paul talks about it. It's the foolishness of the cross. It's the foolishness of Christ, it's the foolishness of grace. What does he mean when Paul talks about the foolishness of the cross?

Well you see when Jesus Christ came to earth as the Messiah, and he says, I am the Messiah,  I have come to bring the kingdom of God. Now in the world's eyes, if you're coming to breathe the king and to clean this place  up and to make everything okay again and to deal with evil and suffering and injustice,  what would you do? You'd come as a general with an army and you'd smite the evil doers or you'd come as  a philosopher and you would convince everybody and but he goes to the cross and he becomes  weak and he dies on the cross and Paul says, by the world standards, that's foolishness,  but they don't realize it's actually a consummate wisdom and here's the reason why. The reason that the world sees the cross as foolishness is that when we look at all  the evil in the world, everybody's got a theory about what's wrong with the world. If Jesus Christ had dealt with it, they would have come and hurt those people or those people  to see.

We all have a theory about what's wrong with the world and it's never us. It's never us. It's them. It's Democrats. It's Republicans.

Say, in other words, there's always a, there was really making this world a bad place  is those people over there where wise in our own eyes were fools and therefore if Jesus  Christ goes to the cross, it looks foolish but his consummate wisdom because only by going  to the cross and taking our punishment, the punishment that we deserve, could God someday  be able to end evil without ending us. Fools who are wise in their own eyes think the cross is foolishness, it's actually wise. And Paul says, oh, the foolishness of God is wiser than the wisdom of men, the weakness  of God is stronger than the strength of men. And he says, if you want to become a Christian, you've got to become a fool. The fool for Christ, first of all, you've got to admit you have been a fool and you've  been wise in your own eyes and you have to embrace the foolishness of the cross and  look like a fool to the world, especially in a place like New York.

But then you'll know there's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. You know, Psalm 134, Psalm 131, I'm going to say it again because I'm afraid I've said  so many of the things you're going to forget it in the mass of stuff, I've said Psalm  134 says, because you've forgiven me, because I see your forgiveness and grace, therefore  I fear you. First of all, I read that. I said, that doesn't make any sense at all because I was thinking of negative fear. But you see what it's saying?

When I see how gracious you are, when I see how good you are, when I see what you did  to save me, when I saw where, when I see your grace and your goodness, it makes me  tremble. I'm afraid. I'm afraid of grieving you, afraid of dishonoring you, afraid of disappointing you in any way. And when you have that joyful fear, it's the beginning of wisdom. Go get it, but it's great.

Our Father, as we take the elements of your supper, the bread and the cup, these are  things that the world sees as foolishness, but we know them as wisdom and we pray that  you would tell us again right now about the greatness of what you did for us, so that we  can increase in our joyful fear and become more and more wise, like your Son, in whom all  the treasures of knowledge and wisdom are hid, it's an isn't that we pray, amen.

Today's scripture reading is from the Book of Proverbs 1-9-22-32-33. The Proverbs of Solomon, Son of David, King of Israel, for gaining wisdom and instruction,  for understanding words of insight, for receiving instruction in prudent behavior, doing  what is right and just and fair, for giving prudence to those who are simple, knowledge and  discretion to the young, let the wise listen and add to their learning and let the discerning  get guidance. For understanding Proverbs and parables, the sayings and riddles of the wise, the fear  of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. Listen, my son, to your father's instruction and do not forsake your mother's teaching,  they are a garland to grace your head and a chain to adorn your neck. How long will you who are simple love your simple ways?

How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge? For the waywardness of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy  them. But whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease without fear of harm. The word of the Lord, thanks be to God. So for the first three weeks here after Labor Day, we're going to do a real short series  on the very first chapters of the book of Proverbs, which is the number one book in the Bible  about wisdom.

Now, if you live in New York City, one of the things that you see are choices, they're  just zillions and zillions of choices. One of the reasons for that is that, excuse me, one of the reasons for that is that is  a density, you know, in the rest of the country there's 90 people per square mile living.  90 people per square mile living in the rest of America. In Manhattan, there's 60,000 people per square mile. So if you have expert, and that means more than just more restaurants, it means which  is, you know, I don't know where to go to eat, where to go to eat. But you have all these other choices, should I stay in the business I'm in, should I get  into a new career, should I stay with this company, should I move into the company, should  I go into business for myself, should I go to grad school, where will I work after  school, should I marry this person or not, all the deals, all the collaborations, all  the partnerships, because it's dense here, there's all these choices to make.

And you know what, if you don't make good choices, it can be very destructive. Bad choices blow up on you. Every choice is like a fork in a road and once you make it, you really can't go back to  where you were. And if you make the wrong choice, you never really in a sense can go back. So what does it take to make good choices, especially in a place like New York to live  is to make good choices?

What does it take? It takes wisdom, and the book of Proverbs is perhaps the most famous texts in the world. Millions of people, for thousands of years have looked to it for help and we're going  to look for just three weeks at ourselves. Now if we take a look at the very first few verses of the book, we're going to see the basics  and what do we have here? What wisdom is, why it's important, why it's a problem, and where to get it, okay?

What wisdom is, why it's important, why it's a problem, and where you can find it. First of all, let's look at what wisdom is. And right off the bat, look at verse 1 and 2, it says, these are the Proverbs of Solomon  for gaining wisdom. But what's the word wisdom mean? Well, one of the best ways to figure out what it means is to look at the synonyms.

Look at the other words that are used to describe wisdom right there in those first sentences. One of the synonyms is the word insight. Do you see this? For gaining wisdom, that's the first part of verse 2. And for understanding words of insight, what's insight?

It's a Hebrew word, the word binaw, and it's a word that actually means to notice differences,  to see, find distinctions that other people can't see. Ever notice when a master detective walks into a crime scene, the master detective sees  20 or 30 clues, and everybody else has just got two, but that's insight. But by the way, insight doesn't just mean noticing 20 things when other people only see one or two. It also means to imagine wisdom in insight means to imagine 20 or 30 things where other people  can only imagine one or two. If somebody says, well, I'm in this situation and there's only two things I can do.

And an insightful person says, no, no, you got about 15 things that you could do. And here they are, and breaks it down. So wisdom is insight. It's the ability to see distinctions where other people can see a blur. Secondly, you have the word prudence.

You see that? This is verse 3 and 4. For receiving instruction in prudent behavior, verse 4, for giving prudence to those who are simple. And the word prudence is, it translates a Hebrew word, that means practical. It means to know strategic.

It means to know how to actually get things done, how to make a goal into reality,  not just to talk about it, but to actually bring it into reality. Or another way to say it, wise people are not just characterized by insight, but also by foresight. They don't just diagnose the problem. They also know how to solve it. And then third, by the way, is the word instruction.

It's, notice it says in verse 2, for gaining wisdom and instruction,  it's a kind of strange English word to translate a Hebrew word that means character, depth of character. Now, let's pull them all together. What is wisdom? One Old Testament scholar, Garhard von Rod, who knew all about the wisdom literature of the Bible said this. Wisdom, according to the Bible, is competence with regard to the realities of life.

Competence with regard to how life really works, really works. So, for example, is wisdom knowledge? Well, wisdom assumes knowledge. If you don't know anything about a subject, you can't be wise about a subject. So, you can't be wise unless you know, but you can obviously know a lot about a subject and be stupid.

Because wisdom is knowing what to do with the knowledge, how to practically use it. Or put it like this. Is wisdom the same thing as being good and moral, following the rules. Now, according to the Bible, if God made the universe, and He did,  so if there's a God who made the universe, and you disobey Him, you're not just being,  it's not, to disobey the God who made the universe is not just wrong, it's stupid. I mean, if there's a God who made the universe and you disobey Him, it's not just wrong, it's dumb.

It's not going to work. And so, according to the Bible, wisdom assumes that you're good, assumes that you're following the moral rules. But it is quite possible to be very moral and still be stupid. And you know why? So, wisdom is not less than being good.

It's more, but wisdom is not, it's more than just following the moral rules, you know why? Wisdom is knowing what the right thing is to do in the 80% of life situations to which the moral rules don't directly apply. Like if somebody comes and says, well, I've got these two jobs, okay, I'm a Christian, I've got these two jobs. What does the Bible tell me? Well, if I was filled with moral rules, and they're both okay, it wouldn't be a sin to take either job.

And yet, if you take the wrong job, it'll be a disaster. So, you see why you can be very moral, you can be following all the moral rules,  and it's still not another right thing to do in the 80% of life situations to which the moral rules don't directly apply. So, wisdom is, you've got to be knowledgeable and you've got to be good to be wise, but you can be both good and wise and still be really dumb. Wisdom is competence with regard to the realities of life, it's competence with regard to how life really works. That's the first point, that's what it is.

Now, he begins to see why it's so important, because down here in verse 32, it says,  for the waywardness of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them. Now, that's saying that people without wisdom, the simple and the fools, are not just simply, it's not just unfortunate if you don't have wisdom. It'll kill you. It'll literally kill you. Why?

Well, let's take a look at this for a minute. First of all, let's look at these two words, the simple and the fool. Now, these are two Hebrew words, and they're used throughout the book of Proverbs. The simple is a word that means young naive people who are too unruited and unformed to make smart decisions because they're going with a crowd. And by the way, those of, I got to be careful here, I always put this, this is a particular form of foolishness that young people fall into.

What is it? Notice it says, the waywardness of the simple will kill them. Wayward means to go off the road, and the thing that often really harms us when we're young is we care so much what our friends think. I mean, to be a teenager or young adult, the people that you like to have them think you're not cool, it's the worst thing in the world. And because young people are so incredibly affected by what their friends think, they'll very often go off the road.

They'll be wayward because they're too concerned with what people think. They're too affected by what people think. Instead of doing the wise thing, they'll do the popular thing. And you're looking back, there are so many choices that people made when they were in this, this simpleton form. You look back on your younger years, you say, why did I ever think that would work?

Why did I think I would get away with it? Why did I think I wouldn't be found out was because I was blinded by the crowd I was with. And so that's one, the waywardness of the simple will kill you. But the other name, the other word, a fool. This is a Hebrew word that actually means almost the opposite kind of foolishness.

Why? Well, the fool is a person who is wise in his own eyes. That's the characteristic of the fool in the book of problems. And you see a simple fool, you might say, a simpleton, is a young person who is too concerned about what people think. Whereas a fool, according to the book of problems, is somebody who doesn't care enough what other people think.

That is, he's wise in his own eyes. By the way, just because it's so hard to go, he, she, he, she, whenever you talk about fools, you're going to talk about he. But I just want you to know, those of you who art, he's, it could be you. I just like, it could be you. But anyway, the fool, he's wise in his own eyes and he's sat in his ways.

And here's a bunch of synonyms that one old Testament professor put in his commentary. A fool is self-right, just opinionated, stubborn, hard to persuade, gets his back up when if you try to correct them, and despises his correction. Now, their opposites. The simple ton is a person to conserve what people think. Whereas the fool is a person who's not concerned enough.

They don't, the fools are people who don't listen to what others say, you can't talk to them, they're sat in their ways, they're sure they know. But they're both out of touch with reality. See, if wisdom is, competence with regard to reality, wisdom does the thing in the situation that fits with reality as God has made it, basically. God made the world in a certain way, it's God's world, it's also a broken world because of sin. And a wise person figures sees the created brokenness of the reality and says, what is the wisest thing to do?

Simpletons aren't in touch with reality, they're in touch with their friends. Fools are not in touch with reality, they're in touch with their own pride, their own dignity, they're sure they know. But what it takes to be wise is to be in touch with reality and fools whether they're too open to what other people say or not open enough are not in touch with reality. So, for example, here you have a situation, a really difficult situation and you're in it with people and here's the question, should I speak out, should I open my mouth, should I just tell them everything, should I confront or should let it go. Should I let it be, should I not say anything?

Now, both of those things are perfectly right. As we go through the book of Proverbs, you're going to see that there's two Proverbs that are almost back to back. And I think it's in chapter 25 and it goes like this, answer a fool according to his folly, or he'll be wise in his own eyes, like the next verse is, don't answer a fool in his folly,  because he'll despise you. So, you read it and you say, okay, which is it eyes? See, we don't know, Christians do not know how to read the book of Proverbs because we look at the book of Proverbs as if it's a bunch of rules, but it's not a bunch of rules.

It's about wisdom, it's about how life actually works and those two Proverbs next to each other are not contradictions. What it's trying to say is, sometimes you ought to confront a fool and sometimes you shouldn't. And a wise person knows the difference. Now, here's the problem. Almost all of us are not in touch with reality enough to know when to do and when not to.

Why? Point three. Point three is, here's why wisdom is such a problem. Some years ago, I read a really great article in the Atlantic Monthly with an interview with Drom Kagan. Drom Kagan taught for many years at Harvard.

He's retired in long retired. He's still alive, I believe. But he was like the child psychologist of his time, later on that's called developmental psychology, very, very respected, brilliant man. And in the article, he was being interviewed and he said that across 36 cultures now, with thousands and thousands and thousands of people studied. He says, we now know that I'm paraphrasing it, but paraphrasing it, that neurochemistry creates three basic, habitual reactions to threats.

So every one of us, no matter what the culture, there's three different ways that our neurochemistry has wired us to respond to danger or a threat or a problem. He says, some people are wired for what he calls, some are anxious, some are aggressive and some are philosophical. He says, the anxious people, basically you're wired to instinctively say, let me out of here. When there's a threat, you say, just cut your losses, just get out, just go. He says the aggressive is when there's a problem, you say, let me get in there and deal with it.

You know, I'm gonna get it before it gets me, that's the aggressive part. So he says, anxious people tend to be pessimistic, this is never gonna work, just leave. Aggressive people tend to be optimistic and say, I can handle this, get in there and try to deal with it. The philosophical are wired to say something like this. Just calm down.

Let's not do anything rash. No use getting bent out of shape. Let's wait and see. Now, Kagan goes on and says, do you realize that we're all wired for one of those responses? One of those responses feels right.

Feels absolutely right. Feels wise to you. It happens instinctively, it feels like the best thing to do. You do it almost without thinking. But he says, you realize that in most situations, your habitual response is inappropriate.

He says anxious people are best in situations where danger is really high. You know why? Because the only way that you're going to actually survive is without spending a lot of time thinking about it to get out. So anxious, the anxious response is the best response for highly dangerous situations. And anxious people are the people who are the most functional in that situation.

It's as aggressive people are best when it comes to mid-level danger. If the danger is kind of middle size, sometimes your confidence, I can handle this. He actually sometimes makes pays off, but even if it doesn't pay off, it won't be lethal. He says philosophical types are best in situations that look worse than they are. If you're in a situation and it's kind of looks dangerous, but actually it's not, the philosophical say, let's slow down, let's stop.

And some situations are really not that bad, but if you act evasively like the anxious person or aggressively, you can actually make it worse. And so what Kagan says is you realize that whatever seems the most natural way for you to deal with threats is usually wrong. In the exact right spot, it's perfect. But in many cases, it's inappropriate and kind of dysfunctional. In some cases, it's absolutely lethal.

Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer? Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith? For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding of what it means to follow Christ. A great resource to start using this summer is the new city catechism devotional, God's truth for our hearts and minds. This devotional brings the historic catechisms of the Christian Church to life, offering a question to consider for each week of the year.

In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catechesis, the rich and communal practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers that frame the foundational beliefs of the Christian faith. Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer, and a brief meditation that will challenge and inspire you. The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller, and Kevin De Young, as well as historical figures such as Augustine, John Calvin, and Martin Luther. This month, in addition to the new city catechism devotional, we are including a great companion resource, the new city catechism for kids, as our thank you for your gift to help gospel-on-life share the hope of Christ's love with people all over the world. So request your copies today at gospel-on-life.com-slash-give, that's gospel-on-life.com-slash-give.

Now, here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. Now, what does that mean? And then Jerome Kagan goes on and says this, and this sounds right out of the book of Proverbs. Don't forget he was a child psychologist. He says, for the wise men of all, pardon me, modern, wrong quote, I'll get there.

It's late, and I'm old. From the article, he says, modern parents have been taught that their children need to find themselves and be themselves. But unless parents intervene, their children's natural temperament will dominate them, and they won't learn how to act wisely in situations in which their habitual temperamental response is inappropriate. Good parenting will see the dark side of their children's temperament, and will intervene showing them that they have to have a greater range of responses. Now, these are all from the article.

The point is, the aggressive have to realize you sometimes are to blame. The anxious have to realize that sometimes you aren't to blame. The philosophical have to realize that sometimes things are really terrible. So what parents need to go to with their children is they need to challenge the anxious to be bold, the bold to be anxious, the pessimistic to have hope and the chronically sunny to worry more. Now, Proverbs, I told you this head at this point, I'm trying to show you why wisdom is such a problem.

Proverbs chapter 22 verse 15 says, foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child. You know what that means? We're all naturally foolish. Jerome Kagan says so. The way we're wired automatically makes us respond in habitual ways that are often inappropriate.

They're out of touch with reality. They're in touch with our temperament. They're in touch with our opinion. They're in touch with what the crowd says, but they're not in touch with reality. And fools are people that are not in touch with reality.

And Kagan says foolishness is natural. Wisdom is acquired. If you're just yourself, you're going to be a fool. If your parents just let you be yourself, you're going to be a fool. If your friends just let yourself be yourself, you're going to be a fool.

And if you let yourself be yourself, you're going to be a fool. You see the problem it is? And he's also right in saying that unless somebody, listen, unless you learn wisdom, which takes years,  it takes years of training, it takes years of humbling yourself, it takes years of not being wise in your own eyes,  it takes years of being corrected by people and receiving correction. It takes years of being mentored, it takes years of being trained, of learning. We're going to see all this by the way in the next couple of weeks.

Years of getting to know the Word of God, getting to know God, getting to know your own heart,  it takes years and years of pushing yourself out beyond your comfort zone,  pushing yourself out beyond your natural temperament, pushing yourself out,  it takes years to develop and if you don't, you're going to be killed, you're going to be destroyed,  you're going to make bad choices and they're going to blow up on you. And also, Kagan's right, when he says, is our culture. The culture is completely against us, the culture says you need to be yourself,  the idea that you're supposed to fight against your temperament and not try to be yourself  and to learn wisdom, oh no. What the culture says is be yourself and if you've got a problem, find a technique. Now let me get to the, you see as Lewis has a quote from his book, The Abolition of Man,  which I just tried to read to you a minute ago.

And Lewis says, if you want to summarize the difference between modern times and ancient times, listen. He says, for the wise men of old, the cardinal problem had been how to conform the sold reality  and the solution was knowledge, self-discipline, and virtue. He says, that's the ancient way. The ancient way is our problem is that we are not conform to reality. How do we conform the sold reality?

And the answer is virtue and wisdom and change, change yourself. But today, he says, the problem is how to subdue reality to our wishes. That's what modern people want and the solution is a technique. So for example, plenty of Christians who consider themselves not being influenced by their culture  but being influenced by the Bible are more influenced by their culture in this area than they think. And I'll give you an example.

Over the years, I've had people so often come to me  and say, I've got a big question. I've got a choice to make. I have to choose this or this or I have to choose from this or this. And I wanted to discern God's will. I want to know what God's will is.

Well, that's very spiritual. It is. It's right. I only want to do what God wants me to do, okay? So I would like to know, when you pray, how can you tell which of the options God wants?

In other words, is there a way to pray so that I can sense God showing me? So when I pray about this or this or this or this, do I,  and I feel more peace when I'm praying about this rather than this,  is that God telling me, I mean, how do I discern God guiding me to show me what I should do? And my response to them is virtually never a very satisfying response to them at first. I hope later maybe it is. Because I always say, look, prayer is a very big part of what it means to become a wise person.

We'll talk about that again in the next couple of weeks. But I said, you know, you need it. As far as the Bible is concerned, here's how you discern God's will. You become a wise person through years of training, through learning,  through getting to know God, getting to know the Word, getting to know your own heart,  getting going through suffering, being corrected by people. You slowly, slowly, slowly become a discerning, insightful, prudent, wise person.

And then, when you've got a choice to make, choose the option that you think is best. Because when you come into me and say, well, I want to learn how in prayer I can sort of lay things out in front of God  and find out what God wants. That's a technique. That sounds very spiritual. Oh, I just want to know what God wants.

In other words, it sounds very spiritual. It's a technique. You're doing exactly what your culture wants. Not to conform the soul to reality, but to conform the reality of the soul. Not you make the change, but you find a technique that when you get into a situation,  no, actually, I haven't spent years praying.

I haven't spent years being learning correction. I haven't had years of experience. I haven't had these things. This is a technique. Do you see the problem we've got?

This is what wisdom is, being in touch with, competent with regard to realities of life. The real problem is that we're all fools by nature. And if we don't learn the wisdom to make good choices, it's going to destroy us. So, how do we find that wisdom? Now, all we can do at this point is point to the next couple of weeks,  one verse here that tells us how to begin the search.

How do you find this wisdom? Here's how it begins. It's right there. In fact, that's the word. Look at verse seven.

This is one of the most famous verses in the Bible because it's repeated over and over again. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. Okay. Here's the last thing I'm going to tell you. Here's how you find wisdom.

It's through paradoxical fear and the foolishness of grace. Paradoxical fear and the foolishness of grace. So, first of all, paradoxical fear. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge. Don't you notice how strange it is that fear here is obviously a positive thing?

You and I would think of fear as negative. In fact, there's many places in the Bible that see fear as negative. Right? The Bible says perfect love casts out fear. Fear is bad.

The Bible says God has not given us a spirit of fear. So why is the fear of the Lord here a positive kind of fear? Well, there's a negative and a positive kind of fear. Do you know what they are? There's two ways to be afraid in the presence of someone.

The first way is you're afraid if you think they may hurt you or hurt you or say something mean to you. In other words, if you distrust the person, you really distrust that person. They might say something really mean, they may do something to hurt you. So if you go into the presence of someone you really distrust, you can be kind of scared. But there's another way to go into the presence of someone to be afraid.

Right after the first Lord of the Rings movie came out,  a lot of the actors who were in the first movie were at a Barnes and Noble downtown. I think it was on... Yeah, I can't remember where it was exactly, but it was downtown somewhere. And Kathy and I went and one of the people who was there was Christopher Lee,  big tall Christopher Lee with the... You know, he placed Saruman in the Lord of the Rings and he's in his 80s now.

But he talked about one time running into when he was a younger man somewhere,  JRR Tolkien himself, whose works he just loved and revered. And he talked about the fact that he went all kind of trembling. And I raised that set and is the Christopher Lee voice. And he says, when he met Tolkien, he says, and I almost note. Now, here's the point.

When you find yourself in the presence of somebody who's so revered,  you were in such awe of... Have it ever happened to you? You just get a tremble. But it's a positive fear, it's not a negative fear. See, you can be afraid of...

The negative fear is you're afraid that somebody's going to hurt you,  because you distrust them. A positive fear is you're afraid you're going to disappoint them. You're going to dishonor them. Is it going to grieve them or something? Because you love them so much.

Because you appreciate them so much, right? The negative fear is actually selfish. I'm afraid I'm going to get hit. But the positive fear is actually all about the person. I don't want it in any way to dishonor this person or bore this person  or offend this person or certainly grieve this person.

And that is the fear of the Lord. That is a fear that is a joyful fear. It's a positive fear. It's on wonder before him. It's not being afraid he's going to condemn you.

You're afraid that he's going to hurt you? You're afraid in a sense that you're going to grieve him. If I put in a priceless Ming dynasty vase in your hands,  it was beautiful. It was thousands of years old and with worth millions of dollars,  you might get scared. Why?

Not because you're afraid it's going to hurt you. You're afraid you're going to hurt it. And the fear of the Lord is a joyful fear. It's such on wonder and such love that you don't want to grieve him  or do anything to avoid dishonoring him. Now, if you had that kind of fear,  do you realize how different that is?

How different that is from just believing in God? And do you realize that most people in the world are obeying God  out of negative fear? Negative fear is, I've got to obey God. Otherwise, he's going to hit me. But if you had the positive fear,  if you had this joyful fear,  do you realize what that would do?

It would make you wise. You know how? First of all, you wouldn't be simple. If you had this kind of relationship with God,  if God meant this to you,  if you had this sense of his love and his delight in you  and if you wanted more than anything else to give love  and delight to him,  then you wouldn't care what other people think. You wouldn't be a simpleton.

You wouldn't be wayward. You wouldn't care what other people think. This also wouldn't be an obstacle  because you wouldn't care what you think anymore. You wouldn't have that insecurity that needs to be right. You wouldn't be standing on your own dignity.

There'd be humility. There'd be an ease, there'd be an openness. The fear of the Lord, this positive joyful fear of the Lord  would be the very beginning of your wisdom. How do you get that? The only way to get it is to be absolutely sure  that God is not going to hurt you.

To be absolutely sure that in spite of your flaws, he will not condemn you. The difference between a converted person, a person with a new heart, a person who understands  the gospel, and a person who is just nuckling under, is a difference between a person with  the positive fear of God versus the negative fear of God, right? And how can you get that positive fear of God? We've got to know that there is no condemnation for you. And the only way to do that is this, put the book of Proverbs in the whole Bible, put  it in the context of the whole Bible, and in the Old Testament we know there's a negative  and positive fear, but when you get to the New Testament, we learn there's also a negative  and positive foolishness.

Negative foolishness we've been looking at, but there's a positive foolishness, St. Paul talks about it. It's the foolishness of the cross. It's the foolishness of Christ, it's the foolishness of grace. What does he mean when Paul talks about the foolishness of the cross?

Well you see when Jesus Christ came to earth as the Messiah, and he says, I am the Messiah,  I have come to bring the kingdom of God. Now in the world's eyes, if you're coming to breathe the king and to clean this place  up and to make everything okay again and to deal with evil and suffering and injustice,  what would you do? You'd come as a general with an army and you'd smite the evil doers or you'd come as  a philosopher and you would convince everybody and but he goes to the cross and he becomes  weak and he dies on the cross and Paul says, by the world standards, that's foolishness,  but they don't realize it's actually a consummate wisdom and here's the reason why. The reason that the world sees the cross as foolishness is that when we look at all  the evil in the world, everybody's got a theory about what's wrong with the world. If Jesus Christ had dealt with it, they would have come and hurt those people or those people  to see.

We all have a theory about what's wrong with the world and it's never us. It's never us. It's them. It's Democrats. It's Republicans.

Say, in other words, there's always a, there was really making this world a bad place  is those people over there where wise in our own eyes were fools and therefore if Jesus  Christ goes to the cross, it looks foolish but his consummate wisdom because only by going  to the cross and taking our punishment, the punishment that we deserve, could God someday  be able to end evil without ending us. Fools who are wise in their own eyes think the cross is foolishness, it's actually wise. And Paul says, oh, the foolishness of God is wiser than the wisdom of men, the weakness  of God is stronger than the strength of men. And he says, if you want to become a Christian, you've got to become a fool. The fool for Christ, first of all, you've got to admit you have been a fool and you've  been wise in your own eyes and you have to embrace the foolishness of the cross and  look like a fool to the world, especially in a place like New York.

But then you'll know there's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. You know, Psalm 134, Psalm 131, I'm going to say it again because I'm afraid I've said  so many of the things you're going to forget it in the mass of stuff, I've said Psalm  134 says, because you've forgiven me, because I see your forgiveness and grace, therefore  I fear you. First of all, I read that. I said, that doesn't make any sense at all because I was thinking of negative fear. But you see what it's saying?

When I see how gracious you are, when I see how good you are, when I see what you did  to save me, when I saw where, when I see your grace and your goodness, it makes me  tremble. I'm afraid. I'm afraid of grieving you, afraid of dishonoring you, afraid of disappointing you in any way. And when you have that joyful fear, it's the beginning of wisdom. Go get it, but it's great.

Our Father, as we take the elements of your supper, the bread and the cup, these are  things that the world sees as foolishness, but we know them as wisdom and we pray that  you would tell us again right now about the greatness of what you did for us, so that we  can increase in our joyful fear and become more and more wise, like your Son, in whom all  the treasures of knowledge and wisdom are hid, it's an isn't that we pray, amen.

但我们要怎样得到智慧呢？今天，让我们一同聆听提姆·凯勒的讲道，来看我们如何把神的智慧运用在日常生活各种复杂的处境中。当你收听今天的信息时，我们邀请你上 Gospelinlife.com 登记接收电邮更新。登记之后，你会收到我们每一季的期刊，以及其他以福音为中心的宝贵资源。现在就上 Gospelinlife.com 订阅吧。

今天的经文选自《箴言书》1 章 1–9 节，22、32–33 节。以色列王、大卫的儿子所罗门的箴言，是要使人晓得智慧和训诲，分辨通达的言语，使人处事领受智慧的训诲、仁义、公平、正直，使愚蒙人灵明，使少年人有知识和谋略，使智慧人听见，增长学问，使聪明人得着智谋，使人明白箴言和譬喻、智慧人的言词和谜语。敬畏耶和华是知识的开端，愚妄人藐视智慧和训诲。我儿，要听你父亲的训诲，不可离弃你母亲的法则，因为这要作你头上的华冠，你项上的金链。

“你们愚蒙人喜爱愚蒙，要到几时呢？

亵慢人喜爱亵慢，愚昧人恨恶知识，要到几时呢？

愚蒙人背道，必杀己身；愚昧人安逸，必害己命。惟有听从我的，必安然居住，得享安宁，不怕灾祸。”这是主的话，感谢上帝。

劳工节之后接下来的三个主日，我们要很短地讲一组系列信息，都是从《箴言书》最前面的几个章节出来的。《箴言》是整本圣经中关于「智慧」的头号书卷。

如果你住在纽约市，你很快就会发现一件事：选择实在太多太多了，成千上万种选择。原因之一是——不好意思——原因之一是人口密度。在美国其他地方，每平方英里大约九十个人；整个美国平均是每平方英里九十人。而在曼哈顿，每平方英里是六万人。所以这不只是意味着餐馆更多——当然也意味着「哇，我不知道要去哪家吃饭」。它还意味着你有无数其他选择：我要不要继续待在现在的行业？要不要换一个职业？要不要留在这一家公司？要不要换一家公司？要不要自己创业？要不要读研究生？毕业以后要去哪工作？要不要嫁／娶这个人？各种 deal、各种合作、各种伙伴关系，因为这里人口太密集，所以摆在你面前的选择也特别多。

你知道吗，如果你不会作出好的选择，后果会非常严重。糟糕的选择会在你身上爆炸。每一个选择都像一条路上的岔口，一旦你选了，你就没办法回到原来的位置。如果你选错了，从某种意义上说，你永远回不到从前。

那要怎样才能作出好的选择呢？特别是在像纽约这样的地方，要活下去就必须作出好的决定，那需要什么？需要智慧。《箴言》大概是全世界最出名的一本关于智慧的书卷。几千年来，数以百万计的人从那里寻求帮助。接下来的三个主日，我们也要一起来看。

如果我们来看这卷书最前面的几节，就会看到一些基本的东西——这里有什么呢？有：什么是智慧；为什么智慧重要；为什么智慧这么难；以及到哪里去得着智慧。好不好？什么是智慧，为什么它重要，它为什么成问题，以及你在哪里可以找到它。

首先，我们来看什么是智慧。一开始就看第一、二节：经文说，这些是所罗门的箴言，是为了叫人得着智慧。那「智慧」这个词是什么意思呢？理解它最好的方式之一，是看经文里用来描述智慧的同义词——看看在开头几句里，还有哪些字用来描写智慧。

其中一个同义词是「洞察」（insight）。你看见了吗？第二节上半说：为要使人晓得智慧；接着说：和训诲，分辨通达的言语——也就是洞察。「洞察」这个希伯来字是「binah」，意思是「察觉差别」，能够看见别人看不见的细微区分。

你有没注意过，当一个大侦探走进案发现场时，这位高手一眼就看到二三十个线索，而其他人只看到一两个——那就是洞察力。顺带一提，洞察不仅仅是别人只看到两件事，你看到二三十件；洞察还意味着：当别人只想得出一两种做法时，你却能想出二三十种。有人说：「我现在就只有两条路可以走。」而一个有洞察力的人会说：「不不，你至少有十五种做法。」然后一条条地拆出来给你看。

所以，智慧包含洞察力——在别人只看到一团模糊时，能看出里面的差别。

第二个词是「谨慎」（prudence）。你看到吗？第三、四节：使人处事领受「智慧的训诲」，第四节：使愚蒙人灵明——这里的「灵明／诡诈／精明」，就是给愚蒙人「诡诈」或「谨慎」。这个「谨慎」对应的希伯来字，意思是「实际、策略」。也就是知道要怎么真正把事情完成，怎样把目标变成现实——不是只会谈，而是能把它变成现实。或者换个说法：有智慧的人不仅有洞察力，也有前瞻性。他们不只是会诊断问题，他们也知道怎样解决问题。

第三个词是「训诲」（instruction）。你注意到第二节说：「使人晓得智慧和训诲」——英语里用 instruction 这个有点奇怪的词，去翻一个希伯来字，它其实指的是「品格」，是内在品格的深度。

现在，把这些都放在一起：什么是智慧？一位旧约学者冯·拉德（Gerhard von Rad）熟悉圣经中的智慧文学，他这样说：照圣经的定义，智慧就是对人生现实有「能力／熟练度」——在面对人生真实运作方式时，有胜任能力。

所以，举例来说：智慧是不是知识？智慧假设你有知识。如果你对某个领域一无所知，你不可能在那方面有智慧。所以，你若想有智慧，必须先有知识；但很显然，你可以对一个领域懂得很多，却仍然很愚蠢。因为智慧是知道如何使用这些知识，怎样实际地运用。

或者这么说：智慧是不是等同于「做好人、守规矩」呢？照圣经的看法，如果是上帝创造了宇宙——而祂确实如此——那么，如果你违背那位创造宇宙的上帝，这不只是「错」，也是「愚蠢」。如果真有一位创造宇宙的上帝，而你违背祂，那不只是道德上错误，也是愚笨——这行不通。所以照圣经，智慧预设你是「好人」，预设你在遵守道德规范。但同样可能：一个人很守规矩，却还是非常愚蠢。你知道为什么吗？

所以，智慧不比「做好人」少，但也不只是「做好人」。它比那更深。为什么？因为智慧就是：在人生当中那 80% 没有清楚道德规则可直接套用的情境里，知道「什么才是当作的事」。有人来跟你说：「我有两份工作可以选；我是基督徒，这两份都不是罪，圣经里也没有哪条诫命禁止任何一份。」从道德守则的角度看，两份都没问题——选哪一份都不算犯罪。但你也知道，如果你选错那一份，整个人生可能会一团糟。

你看见了吗？你可以非常有道德，非常遵守一切道德规范，却仍然不知道，在那 80% 圣经没有写明白、不在「是非黑白」上的日常情境中，什么才是当作的事。所以，要有智慧，你需要有知识、需要做好人，但即使既有知识又有道德，仍然可能非常愚蠢。智慧是对人生现实有胜任的能力——对「世界实际是怎样运作的」有胜任的能力。这是第一点：什么是智慧。

欢迎收听「福音在城中」播客。我们在生活中面对的许多问题都很复杂，并不是只要照着几条规则就能得到答案的。我现在该开口说话，还是先等等？我要不要换工作，还是留在原来的岗位？正因为如此，智慧就显得格外重要。

那我们要怎样得着智慧呢？今天，就让我们一同聆听提姆·凯勒的讲道，看我们如何把上帝的智慧运用在日常生活各种复杂的处境中。当你收听今天的信息时，我们邀请你上 gospelinlife.com 登记电邮更新。登记之后，你会收到我们每一季的期刊，以及其他以福音为中心的宝贵资源。现在就上 gospelinlife.com 订阅吧。

今天的经文选自《箴言书》1 章 1–9 节，22、32–33 节：

「以色列王，大卫的儿子所罗门的箴言，是要使人晓得智慧和训诲，分辨通达的言语；使人处事领受智慧的训诲、仁义、公平、正直；使愚蒙人灵明，使少年人有知识和谋略；使智慧人听见，增长学问，使聪明人得着智谋，使人明白箴言和譬喻、智慧人的言词和谜语。敬畏耶和华是知识的开端，愚妄人藐视智慧和训诲。

我儿，要听你父亲的训诲，不可离弃你母亲的法则，因为这要作你头上的华冠，你项上的金链。

你们愚蒙人喜爱愚蒙，要到几时呢？亵慢人喜爱亵慢，愚昧人恨恶知识，要到几时呢？……愚蒙人背道，必杀己身；愚昧人安逸，必害己命。惟有听从我的，必安然居住，得享安宁，不怕灾祸。」

这是主的话，感谢上帝。

劳工节之后接下来的三个主日，我们要有一个很短的系列，查考《箴言书》最开头的几个章节——这卷书是圣经里面讲「智慧」最重要的书。

如果你住在纽约市，你立刻会发现一件事情：选择实在太多太多了，成千上万的选择。为什么会这样呢？其中一个原因是——不好意思打断一下——其中一个原因，就是人口密度的问题。

你知道，在美国其他地区，每平方英里大约只有九十个人居住——整个美国平均下来，每平方英里也就是九十人。而在曼哈顿，每平方英里有六万人。

这意味着什么呢？不只是意味着餐馆更多——当然这也意味着「哇，我根本不知道要去哪家吃饭」。它还意味着，你前面摆着一大堆别的选择：我要不要继续待在现在的行业？要不要换一个职业？要不要留在现在这家公司？要不要换一家公司？要不要自己出来创业？要不要念研究所？毕业以后的工作要在哪里？要不要跟这个人结婚？

还有各种交易、各种合作、各种伙伴关系；因为这里人口太密集，所以摆在你面前的选择也特别多。

而你也知道，如果你不会做出好的选择，这会带来多大的破坏。糟糕的选择会在你身上爆炸。每一个选择都像是路上的一个岔口，一旦你走上其中一条，你就不可能再回到原来的位置。如果你走错了，从某个意义上说，你永远不能真正回到从前。

那么，要怎样才能做出好的选择呢？特别是在像纽约这样的地方，要活得好，就必须做出正确的决定。这需要什么？需要智慧。《箴言书》大概是全世界最有名的一本智慧书卷。几千年来，上百万的人在其中寻找帮助。接下来的三个主日，我们也要一起来看。

如果我们来看这卷书最前面的几节，就会看到一些基本的东西——这里到底有什么？有：什么是智慧；为什么智慧重要；为什么智慧成了一个难题；以及在哪里能得到智慧。好吗？什么是智慧，为什么它重要，它为什么有问题，还有你在哪里可以找到它。

首先，我们先看什么是智慧。一开始就看第一、二节：经文说，这是所罗门的箴言，为要使人得着智慧。那么「智慧」这个词是什么意思呢？理解它最好的方式之一，就是看圣经在这里用了哪些同义词——看看前面几句话里，还用了哪些词来描述智慧。

其中一个同义词是「洞察」。你看到吗？第二节的上半句：「使人晓得智慧」——然后接着说：「和训诲，分辨通达的言语。」这里的「通达」就是洞察。这个希伯来字是 binah，意思是「辨别差异」，能看见别人看不见的细微区分。

你有没有注意过，当一个顶尖侦探走进案发现场，他一下子能看见二三十条线索，而其他人顶多只看到一两条？那就是洞察力。

顺带一提，洞察力不只是别人只看到两件事，你看到二三十件而已；洞察还意味着：当别人只想得到一两种做法时，你却能想出二三十种。有人说：「我现在只有两条路可以走。」而一个有洞察力的人会说：「不不，你至少有十五种选择。」然后把它们一条一条分解出来。

所以，智慧里包含洞察力——在别人只看到一团模糊的时候，你能看出里面的差别。

“洞察力”这几个字，到底是什么意思呢？

这里用的是一个希伯来词，叫 *binaw*，它真正的意思是：注意到差异，看到别人看不到的区别、分辨。你有没有注意过，当一个侦探高手走进犯罪现场时，他一下子能看到二三十个线索，而旁边的人可能只能看到两三个——这就是洞察力。

不过，洞察力不仅仅是别人只能看见一两件事，而你能看见二三十件事。智慧和洞察力还意味着：在别人只能想出一两种可能的时候，你能想象出二三十种可能。如果有人说：“我现在就两条路可以走。”

有洞察力的人会说：“不、不，你至少有十五种选择可以考虑。来，我们一条一条拆开看看。”所以，智慧就是洞察力，是在别人眼里一片模糊的地方，看见里面各种差别的能力。

其次，这里还有一个词，“谨慎”。你看经文第三、四节：第三节说，“使人晓得智慧和训诲”，第四节说，“使愚蒙人灵明”。这里的“灵明”“谨慎”，翻译的那个希伯来词，本意就是“实用、策略”。

它指的是：知道怎么把事情真正做成，知道怎样把一个目标变成现实，而不是只会谈论，而是把它落实出来。或者换句话说，有智慧的人不仅有洞察力，还有远见。他们不只是会诊断问题，也知道怎么解决问题。

然后第三个词，就是“训诲”。你注意第二节说：“要使人晓得智慧和训诲。”英文翻成 *instruction*，其实有点奇怪，它背后那个希伯来词，真正的意思是“品格”，是“内在的深度”。

现在，我们把这些放在一起：什么是智慧？一位熟悉旧约智慧文学的学者，冯·拉德（Gerhard von Rad）这样总结：按照圣经的理解，智慧就是“对人生现实有胜任力”。

就是对“生命真正如何运作”的那一套，有胜任、有把握。

举个例子：智慧是知识吗？从一个角度讲，智慧是以知识为前提的。如果你对某个主题一无所知，你就不可能在这个主题上有智慧。所以，不懂是谈不上智慧的。

但你显然也可能对一个主题懂得很多，却仍然很愚蠢。

因为智慧是在问：你如何处理这些知识？你怎样把它们实际运用出来？

或者这样说：智慧是不是等同于“做好人、守规则”？按圣经的逻辑，如果上帝是创造宇宙的主——而祂确实是——那么，违背这位创造宇宙的神，不只是“道德上错误”，而且是“愚蠢”。

如果真有一位创造万有的神，而你却违背祂，那不仅是错，也是傻——那根本行不通。所以，按圣经的说法，智慧预设你是一个愿意顺服神、遵行道德律的人。

但同时，非常有可能，一个人在道德上很端正，却仍然很愚蠢。为什么？

所以，智慧并不比“做好人”少，反而更多。但智慧绝不只是“守规矩”，你知道为什么吗？

因为，人生当中大概有 80% 的处境，道德律条本身并不会直接告诉你“具体该怎么做”。

比如，有人来问：“我现在有两个工作机会。好，我是个基督徒，那圣经怎么说？哪一个是神的旨意？”

如果圣经只是一本充满道德规则的书，而这两个工作在道德上都没问题——不论选哪个都不算犯罪——那按规则来说，怎么选都行。

可你和我都知道，如果选错工作，可能会是一场灾难。所以，你明白吗？你可以在道德上没犯任何错，完全照着律法行事，却依然没选对路。

人生当中大约 80% 的情境，圣经的“道德条款”并不会直接告诉你具体要怎么选。你可以很有道德、守住所有规矩，但依旧不知道在这些情境里“真正要做的是什么”。

所以，要有智慧，你当然要有知识，也要有良善的品格；可你同样可能既“懂很多”又“很端正”，却仍然非常愚蠢。

智慧，是对人生现实有胜任力，是对“生命真正如何运作”有把握。这是第一点：什么是智慧。

接着，你就开始明白，为什么它如此重要。因为在三十二节这里说：“愚蒙人背道，必杀己身；愚顽人安逸，必害己命。”

这节经文的意思是：那些没有智慧的人——这里叫“愚蒙人”和“愚顽人”——他们的结局不仅仅是“有点可惜、挺不幸”，而是会自我毁灭。

会要了他们的命，真会要命的。为什么？

我们先来看看经文中的两个词：“愚蒙人”和“愚顽人”。这两个都是希伯来词，在《箴言》全书里常常出现。

“愚蒙人”（the simple）这个词，指的是年轻、单纯、天真，内在还没有扎根、没有形成成熟判断力的人。他们之所以做不出聪明的决定，是因为太容易随大流，随波逐流。顺便说一句，这是一种特别容易出现在年轻人身上的愚昧。

是什么样的愚昧呢？你注意经文说：“愚蒙人背道，必杀己身。”

“背道”（wayward）这个词，原意是“偏离道路”“跑出轨道”。而年轻人身上，常常让他们严重偏离道路的，是他们太在乎同伴怎么看他们。

作为一个青少年或年轻人，如果你喜欢的一群人觉得你“不酷”“不合群”，那几乎是世界上最糟糕的事。所以，因为年轻人极其在意同伴的眼光，他们非常容易就“偏离正路”，走上错误的道路。

他们太在意别人怎么看，太容易被人影响。于是，他们不会做智慧的选择，而是做“受欢迎的选择”。

回头看，你会发现，人在这种“愚蒙期”做的很多决定，后来让自己追悔莫及。你回头看自己的年少岁月，会说：我当时怎么会觉得那样做行得通？我怎么会以为不会被发现？我怎么会觉得自己能逃得过去？

答案就是：那时你被你所在的圈子蒙蔽了眼，被同伴的影响遮住了理智。

这就是“愚蒙人背道，必杀己身”。

但经文里还有一个词，“愚顽人”（the fool），这其实指的是几乎相反的那一种愚昧。

为什么这么说呢？愚顽人的典型特征，就是《箴言》里常说的：“自以为有智慧的人”。

换句话说，如果说“愚蒙人”是那种太在乎别人怎么看的年轻人——你可以叫他“简单人”“单纯人”——那么“愚顽人”就是那种一点也不在乎别人怎么看的人。

如果我一会儿一直用“他”来指代愚顽人，请你知道，我不是说只有男人会愚蠢——“他”也完全可以是“她”。我只是懒得每次都说“他或她”。总之，愚顽人有一个特点：自以为聪明、坚持己见。

有一位旧约学者在注释里列出了一串同义的形容词：愚顽人是自以为义的、固执己见的、顽固的、不容易被说服的，一旦你要纠正他，他立刻竖起反感的“刺”，讨厌别人指出他的错。

现在注意，这两类人刚好是两个极端。简单人（愚蒙人）是“太在乎别人怎么看”，而愚顽人则是“根本不在乎别人怎么想”。愚顽人是不听别人说话的，你跟他说不通，他已经定好自己的路，确信自己早就明白一切。

但两者有一个共同点：都脱离了现实。

如果智慧是“对现实有胜任力”，那智慧就是在一个具体处境里，做出与上帝所造的现实相匹配的事。上帝照着某种秩序创造了世界——这是上帝的世界——同时，这个世界又因罪而破碎。有智慧的人会看清这被造又被罪损坏的现实，然后问：在这样的处境中，什么才是最合乎现实、最合乎上帝旨意的做法？

愚蒙人没有跟现实连上线，他只跟“朋友的看法”连上线。愚顽人也没跟现实连上线，他只跟“自己的骄傲、自己的尊严”连上线，他确信自己早就懂了。

可是，要成为智慧人，就必须真正跟现实连上线。而愚蒙人也好、愚顽人也好——不论是太容易受别人影响，还是根本不听别人任何话——都没有和现实连上线。

所以，举个例子：你现在身处一个非常棘手的处境，里面牵涉到一些人和关系。问题是：我要不要开口？我要不要说真话？我要不要把事情摊开讲、去跟对方面对面？还是我要选择沉默、放一放？

这两种做法，本身都可能是对的。等我们系统看《箴言》的时候，你会发现，书里有两节经文几乎是挨在一起的——我记得大概在第二十五章左右——一节说：“要照愚昧人的愚妄回答他，免得他自以为有智慧。”紧接着下一节却说：“不要照愚昧人的愚妄回答他，恐怕你与他一样。”

你读到这里会说：那到底是要不要回？到底是哪一个才对？

问题就在这里：我们很多基督徒根本不知道该怎么读《箴言》。我们把《箴言》当成一堆“规矩条文”，但它不是规矩集，而是一本关于“如何在现实中活得有智慧”的书。

那两节看似矛盾的箴言，并不是在互相打架，而是在说：有的时候，你确实应该去正面回应愚昧人；而有的时候，你应该闭嘴，不要应声。真正有智慧的人，能分辨什么时候该说，什么时候不该说。

问题是：我们大多数人跟现实的连接感远远不够强，所以常常不知道什么时候该做哪一个。

为什么会这样？这就来到第三点：为什么智慧这么难？

几年前，我在《大西洋月刊》上读到一篇非常出色的访谈，采访的是发展心理学家杰罗姆·凯根（Jerome Kagan）。他在哈佛大学任教多年，如今已经退休，是那个时代最有影响力的儿童心理学家之一，非常受尊敬、极有见地。

在访谈中，他提到一个有意思的研究结论：他说，跨越三十六种文化、成千上万受试者的研究，让我们几乎可以确定一件事——我现在是意译他的意思——那就是：人的神经化学结构，会生成三种基本的“习惯性威胁反应模式”。

也就是说，每一个人，不管来自哪种文化，当面对危险、威胁或困难时，大脑和神经系统天然会倾向于三种反应之一：

第一类是“焦虑型”（anxious）。他们的本能反应就是：“我要离开这里！”一遇到威胁，就想赶快止损、赶快撤离、赶快退后。

第二类是“进攻型”（aggressive）。他们的反应是：“让我上！我要冲进去解决它。”这种人会说：“在它对付我之前，我先搞定它。”

所以，焦虑型的人通常比较悲观：“这肯定不行，赶快撤。”进攻型的人通常比较乐观：“我搞得定，我冲进去就行。”

第三类是“理性型”或“哲学型”（philosophical）。他们被“硬件预设”的反应大概是这样：“先冷静。不要冲动行事。别急着反应，我们先看看再说。”

凯根接着说：你要知道，我们每个人都被“预设”成这三种反应中的一种。对你来说，其中某一种反应“感觉最对”，最自然、最像“智慧的选择”。它一冒出来，你就觉得：“对，这就是该做的。”它几乎是下意识的、本能的，你甚至不用想，就这样做了。

但问题是：在大多数情境里，你的默认反应都是“不合时宜”的。

他说：焦虑型的人，在“真正高度危险”的场景里是最合适的。你知道为什么吗？因为那种时候，你根本没有时间多想。你唯一能保命的方式，就是立刻闪人、马上撤离。所以，在高度危险的情境里，焦虑型的本能反应反而是最靠谱的，焦虑的人在那种场景中反而最“功能齐全”。

进攻型的人，则在“中等危险”的场景里最合适。如果危险处在一个中间层级，有时候那种“我能搞定”的自信，确实会带来好结果。即便有时候不那么“成功”，代价通常也不会要命。

至于理性型（哲学型）的人，则最适合面对“看起来很糟、实际上没那么糟”的情境。如果你身处一个“看上去很危险、其实没那么危险”的处境，理性型的人会说：“先别慌，慢一点，别做冲动决定。”

有些情境其实没那么严重，可是如果你像焦虑型那样一味躲避，或者像进攻型那样一味硬刚，反而会把事情搞得更糟。理性型的人在这种情境下就特别有用。

所以，凯根得出的结论是：你要意识到，对你来说“最自然、最顺手、最像智慧”的那个应对方式，在绝大多数情况下其实都是错的。

在那极少数“刚好匹配”的场景里，那种反应当然非常恰当、甚至堪称完美。但在许多场景中，它会不合时宜，功能失调；在某些场景里，甚至会带来致命后果。

在这本灵修的引言部分，提姆·凯勒详细说明了“要理问答”（catechesis）的价值——这种在群体中，通过问答的形式来背诵、学习信仰核心教义的古老操练。每一周都有一段经文、一篇祷告，还有一段简短的默想，既会挑战你，也会激励你。书中所收录的注释，既有当代牧者，如约翰·派博、提姆·凯勒、凯文·德扬等人的，也有奥古斯丁、约翰·加尔文、马丁·路德等历史人物的。

这个月，除了《新城要理》灵修本，我们还预备了一本非常适合搭配使用的资源——《新城要理——儿童版》——作为我们送给所有支持“福音与生活”事工、一起把基督之爱传到世界各地的奉献者的一份谢礼。如果你愿意支持我们的事工，可以现在就访问 gospel-on-life.com/give 索取你的书，这个网址是 gospel-on-life.com/give。

下面，让我们继续收听提姆·凯勒今天讲道的后半段。

那么，这一切和我们刚才所讲的有什么关系呢？接着，杰罗姆·凯根还有一段话，听起来几乎就像直接从《箴言》里出来的一样。别忘了，他是一位儿童心理学家。他说——我稍微整理一下他的原话——现代的父母往往被教导，要让孩子“找到自我、做自己”。

但如果父母从不介入、从不引导，孩子天生的气质就会完全主导他们的行为，他们就永远学不会，在自己的惯性反应不合适的情境中，怎样作出智慧的选择。好的父母，会看见孩子气质当中的阴暗面，然后介入，告诉他们：你需要学习更多样的反应方式，而不是永远照着本能来。

这些观点都出自那篇文章。重点是什么呢？就是：进攻型的孩子需要学会承认，有时候问题在自己身上；焦虑型的孩子需要学会承认，有时候问题不在自己；而理性型的孩子则要学会承认，有些事情真的非常严重、不能轻描淡写。

所以，父母要对孩子做的一件事，就是：挑战那些焦虑的孩子学会勇敢，挑战那些过度大胆的孩子学会“该害怕的时候要怕一点”；让悲观的学会有盼望，也让那些永远乐观、永远阳光灿烂的孩子学会适度忧虑。

好，现在我前面说过，要用这些例子来说明：为什么智慧这么难。

《箴言》二十二章十五节说：“愚蒙迷住孩童的心。”这句话是什么意思？意思就是：我们生来就是愚昧的。

杰罗姆·凯根从心理学角度说的是同一件事：我们被造的时候，神经系统和气质就已经倾向于某种固定反应，让我们一遇到问题就用那一套惯性方式去应对。而那套方式，往往和现实不相称。

那种反应跟什么连在一起？跟我们的气质，跟我们的主观看法，跟我们周围的圈子连在一起——却没有真正跟“现实”连在一起。愚昧人，就是那些没有跟现实连上线的人。

凯根因此得出结论：愚昧是“天然”的；智慧则是“习得”的。如果你只是“做自己”，最后一定会变成愚昧人。如果父母只是让你“做自己”，你会变成愚昧人。如果朋友只是鼓励你“做自己”，你会变成愚昧人。如果你对自己说：“就让我顺着天性过下去吧”，你也会变成愚昧人。

你看，这就是难题所在。

他还指出，除非有人介入、除非你花多年时间去学习智慧，否则这种天然的愚昧就一直牢牢抓住你。要学会智慧，需要很多年。那意味着多年受训练，多年学习，多年不断自我谦卑，多年不再“自以为聪明”，多年被人纠正、并且愿意受纠正，多年被人带领、被人门训、多年被教导、被塑造。

接下来几周我们会看到：《箴言》一直在强调这一点——你需要多年去认识神的话语，认识上帝自己，认识自己的内心。你需要多年逼迫自己走出舒适区，突破自己的先天气质，跨出那些你“天生就舒服”的边界。

这是多年的过程。如果你不这样做，你会被自己的愚昧吞噬：你会做出糟糕的决定，那些选择迟早会在你身上爆炸，把你伤得很深，甚至毁掉你的生命。

而且凯根还指出，我们所处的文化也在和我们作对。文化不断告诉你：“要做自己。”它绝不会告诉你，你需要对抗自己的气质；它不会说你要克制自己、改变自己，去学习智慧。

现代文化说的是：“就做自己吧。如果出了问题，找个技巧就好。”

这就让我想到 C.S. 路易斯在《人的废除》里的一段话——我刚才其实试着念，却念错了地方，现在重新引给你。

路易斯说，如果你想总结“古人”和“现代人”之间最大的差别，可以这样说：

“在古人看来，最核心的问题是：人的灵魂如何顺服现实？而答案在于知识、自律与美德。”

他说，这就是古人的路数：我们的问题在于，我们没有与现实对齐。那要怎么办？要让灵魂向现实、向真理屈服。解决之道就是品格，就是美德，就是智慧，就是改变自己。

但到了现代，他说，问题变成了：我们怎样把现实屈服在我们的欲望之下？现代人关心的是：如何让世界顺应我的想要？而解决之道，不再是美德，而是“技巧”（technique）。

举个例子：

有很多基督徒自认深受圣经影响、不受文化左右，但在这个问题上，其实被文化塑造得比自己意识到的还要多。让我给你一个常见的例子。

这些年来，经常有人来找我说：“牧师，我有一个很大的问题。我现在面临一个选择：要这样，还是那样；是选这个，还是选那个。我想要分辨神的旨意。”

听起来很属灵，对吗？而且从一个角度看，这的确很属灵：‘我只想做神要我做的事。’

接着他们会问：“那我祷告的时候，该怎么判断？我怎样才能知道，哪一个选项才是神要我选的？”

换句话说，他们其实在问：“有没有一种祷告的方法，可以让我在祷告的时候感觉到：啊，神在指向这条路，而不是那条？如果我为两个选项祷告，当我为其中一个祷告时心里比较有平安，那是不是代表神要我选这个？有没有什么方式可以‘感觉到’神正在引导我？”

而我给出的回答，往往一开始让他们很失望——我也希望，过了一段时间之后，他们能慢慢体会这个答案其实很宝贵。

我通常会说：当然，祷告是成为智慧人的一个非常重要的部分，这一点我们接下来几周还会细讲。

但从圣经的角度看，真正“分辨神旨意”的方式，是：你要在多年里被塑造成一个有智慧的人——通过学习，通过认识神、认识祂的话语、认识自己的内心，通过经历苦难，通过被人纠正和指教。

然后，随着时间一点一点过去——慢慢地、慢慢地——你就会被塑造成一个有辨识力、有洞察力、有谨慎、有智慧的人。

于是，当你再遇到抉择的时候，你就只需要在已经成长出来的智慧里，选择你认为最合适的那一个选项。

可是，当你带着一个问题来找我，说：“我想学一种祷告的方式，让我可以把所有选择摆在神面前，然后感受到神要我选哪一条路。”

你以为自己在做的是一件很属灵的事——听上去的确很属灵：“我只想知道神要我做什么。”

但事实上，你在寻找的是一种“技巧”。这完全符合我们这个文化的逻辑：不是要让灵魂顺服现实，而是要让“现实顺服灵魂”。你不是要自己改变，而是要找到一个技巧，让你在遇到选择时，不需要多年祷告、不需要多年的被纠正、不需要多年的生命经验，就能迅速、轻松、准确地得知“哪一个是神的旨意”。

你看见问题了吗？

这才是智慧真正的样子：对人生现实具有胜任力。而我们的真实困境在于：我们天生都是愚昧人。如果不学会智慧，不学会做出合乎真相的选择，最终会把自己毁掉。

那么，我们该到哪里去找这种智慧？

在这段经文里，我们只能先往后指向接下来几次的信息。但这里已经给了一个起点——就在这节经文里。注意经文怎么说：在第七节，这是整本圣经里最著名的经文之一，因为它在很多地方被反复引用：“敬畏耶和华是知识的开端，愚妄人藐视智慧和训诲。”

我最后要讲的是：我们怎样开始走上“得智慧”的路。

答案是：通过一种“矛盾式的敬畏”，以及借着“看似愚拙的恩典”。

先说第一部分：那种“矛盾式的敬畏”。

“敬畏耶和华是知识的开端。”你有没有注意到，这里“惧怕、敬畏”竟然是一个正面的词？你我平时一听到“惧怕”这个词，脑子里出现的都是负面的情绪。事实上，圣经里也确实有很多地方把恐惧看作负面的：

圣经说：“爱里没有惧怕；爱既完全，就把惧怕除去。”——那里的惧怕是坏的。

圣经又说：“神赐给我们的，不是胆怯的心。”——那也是负面的惧怕。

那为什么这里“敬畏耶和华”却成了智慧的开端呢？

因为，惧怕有两种：负面的惧怕，和正面的惧怕。你知道这两者的区别吗？

在人面前，你也会有两种“害怕”的方式。

第一种是：你怕这个人，因为你怕他伤害你、骂你、羞辱你。如果你根本不信任一个人，你会觉得他随时可能说出恶毒的话、做出伤害你的事。当你走进一个你深深不信任的人面前，你自然会带着恐惧。

但还有另一种“战战兢兢地走近某人”的经验。

在第一部《指环王》电影刚上映不久，有一次，几位主演到城里的一家 Barnes & Noble 书店参加签售活动。我记得好像是在城南某条街上，具体哪一间我已经记不得了。凯西和我那次也去了，现场有一位演员叫克里斯托弗·李，就是那位高高的、演萨鲁曼的老先生——现在已经八十多岁了。

他讲起自己年轻时，有一次偶然遇见了 J.R.R. 托尔金本人的故事——而他对托尔金的作品是何等敬仰、何等热爱。他描述当时情景的时候，用他那种低沉的“克里斯托弗·李式嗓音”说：当他走近托尔金时，整个人都在发抖，几乎要跪下去。

重点在这里：当你走到一个你极其敬重、极其仰慕的人面前时，你会不由自主地发抖。你有一种“畏惧”，但那是正面的惧怕，不是负面的。

你可能因为两种完全不同的原因在某人面前“害怕”。负面的那一种，是因为你怕这个人会伤害你——会打击你、羞辱你，所以你不信任他；正面的那一种，是因为你极其尊敬他、极其爱他，你怕的是自己会辜负他，让他失望，让他忧伤。

负面的惧怕，核心是“我”：我怕受伤，我怕吃亏，我怕被打击。

正面的惧怕，核心却是“对方”：你在乎的是那个人本身，你害怕自己会羞辱他、令他厌倦、让他感到无聊、甚至让他忧伤。

这正是圣经所说的“敬畏耶和华”。

这种敬畏，是一种带着喜乐的敬畏，是在他面前的惊叹与战兢。你不是怕他定你的罪、怕他随时惩罚你。

你怕的，是自己在爱他的同时却伤了他的心。

如果我把一只真正的明代官窑瓷瓶放到你手上——它极其精美，已有数千年历史，价值连城——你一定会紧张起来，对吗？

为什么会怕？不是因为你怕那个瓶子会伤害你，而是你怕自己会把它摔碎。

“敬畏耶和华”就是这种带着喜乐的敬畏：一种充满惊叹和爱慕的战兢，你那么珍视他，以至于你不愿意做任何让他忧伤、蒙羞的事。

如果你有这种敬畏，你知道那会与你仅仅“相信有神”有多不一样吗？

事实上，大多数人对神的“顺服”是出于负面的惧怕：

“我要顺服，不然神会打我。”

但如果你拥有这种正面的、喜乐的敬畏——如果你与上帝的关系是这样的，你会发现，那会慢慢把你变成一个有智慧的人。

怎么说呢？

首先，如果你真有这样的敬畏，你就不会再做愚蒙人。

如果上帝对你来说真是这样一位宝贵的主，如果你真切地经历过祂的爱、祂在你身上的喜悦，如果你心里最渴望的是能让祂也以你为乐——那你就不会再那么在意别人怎么看你了。你不会再被同伴的眼光捆绑，不会再为了“合群”和“酷”而东倒西歪——你就不会再做那种“愚蒙人”。

同样地，这也会把愚顽人的障碍拿走。你也不会再那么在意“自己怎么看自己”。你不会再活在一种时时刻刻需要证明自己是对的、不允许自己犯错的焦虑里；你不会再拼命守住自己的面子。真正的敬畏会在你里面生出谦卑、轻松和开放。

“敬畏耶和华”——这种正面而喜乐的敬畏——正是智慧的起点，是你迈向智慧之路的第一步。

那我们怎样才能得到这种敬畏呢？

唯一的办法，就是彻底确信：神不会伤害你；就是尽管你有这么多缺点和破碎，他仍不会定你的罪。

一个真正“重生”的人——一个有新心的人，一个真正明白福音的人——和一个只是“咬牙硬撑、勉强顺服”的人之间，最大的差别就在这里：

前者有这种喜乐的敬畏；后者只有那种消极的恐惧。

所以，我们前面说到，“敬畏神”有负面和正面的两种。那我们如何真正得到那种“正面的敬畏”呢？唯一的路，就是确信：在基督里，神已经不再定我们的罪。

要看到这一点，我们必须把《箴言》放回整本圣经的大图景中来看。在旧约里，你已经可以看见“负面的惧怕”和“正面的敬畏”这两种不同的“怕”；到了新约，我们又看见另一组对比：有一种“负面的愚拙”，也有一种“正面的愚拙”。

前面那几种“愚蒙、愚顽”，就是负面的愚拙；而保罗在新约里讲的，是“十字架的愚拙”“基督的愚拙”“恩典的愚拙”。

保罗说的这“愚拙”是什么意思呢？

当耶稣基督来到世上，自称是弥赛亚、说自己来要带来神的国的时候，在世人的眼里，如果你真的是来做王、来整顿这个世界、清除邪恶和不公、带来公义和平，你会怎么做？

照人的想象，你应该像一位大将军，带着军队来，把恶人一一击败；或者你至少该像个大哲学家、思想家，用你的讲论说服所有人。

可是耶稣却走上了十字架，在世人看来变得软弱无力，死在羞辱之中。保罗说：按世界的标准看，这简直是愚拙至极。但世界不知道的是：这恰恰是神完美的智慧。

为什么呢？

因为，当我们看见世界上所有的邪恶时，每个人都有一套“理论”，解释到底是什么在毁坏这个世界。如果基督照着我们的理论来解决问题，他大概会先对付“我们眼中的那群坏人”。

我们总是觉得：“问题在那边，不在我这里。”问题是民主党，是共和党，是那一类人、那一个阶层、那一群和我不一样的人。

也就是说，我们总能说出一个“他们”，总把世界出了问题归咎于“别人的那一边”。我们“自以为聪明”，其实就是愚顽人。所以，如果耶稣来，只是照我们的逻辑去惩罚那些“别人”，世界确实可能会少一点罪，但你我早就不存在了。

然而，耶稣选择走向十字架，担当原本该落在我们身上的刑罚。只有通过这种在世人眼里“愚拙”的方式，神才能在有一天“彻底结束邪恶，却不把我们也一并结束掉”。

愚顽人——那些自以为聪明、按自己眼光判断一切的人——总觉得十字架很愚蠢；其实，十字架是至高的智慧。

正如保罗所说：“神的愚拙总比人智慧；神的软弱总比人强壮。”

如果你要成为一个真正的基督徒，你必须愿意先“做一个愚拙的人”：先承认自己过去一直是个愚顽人，自以为聪明；然后拥抱这看似愚拙的十字架，在世人眼中愿意做一个“为基督的愚拙人”。尤其是在像纽约这样的城市，你愿意被人看作“愚拙”。

可是当你这样做的时候，你就会知道：“如今，那些在基督耶稣里的，就不被定罪了。”

诗篇一百三十篇（原文误记成一百三十四篇）有一句话，我再说一遍，因为我担心自己刚才讲了太多内容，你可能已经被信息量淹没，忘了这一句。诗篇作者说：“但在你有赦免之恩，要叫人敬畏你。”

第一次读到这句，我也觉得不太说得通——因为我那时只想到“负面的恐惧”。但你看，它真正的意思是：

“当我看见你的赦免，当我看见你的恩典，当我看见你为救我所付出的代价，当我看见你这样良善，这样愿意饶恕——这一切让我战兢。我害怕的是，自己有一天会叫你忧伤，会轻看你的恩典，会让你失望。”

这种因赦免而生出的“战兢敬畏”，就是智慧的起点。

当这种“喜乐的敬畏”在你里面越来越深，你就会开始真正变得有智慧。

所以，让我们去追求它吧——因为这是何等美好。

天父，当我们一会儿领受圣餐——饼与杯的时候，愿你提醒我们：在世界眼里，这些记号看起来愚拙，可我们知道，它们代表的是你极大的智慧。

求你再一次向我们显明，你为我们所成就的一切，好叫我们的“喜乐敬畏”更加增长，好叫我们在智慧上越来越像你的儿子，因为‘一切智慧和知识的宝藏，都藏在他里面’。奉他尊贵的名祷告，阿们。
