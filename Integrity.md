### 引言：诚信的困境

当马克·吐温还是个男孩时，有一天他走在街上，看到一辆装满西瓜的车。他喜欢西瓜，于是悄悄靠近，偷了一个，跑到小巷里咬了一口。然而刚咬下去，一种奇怪的感觉涌上心头。他毫不犹豫地走回车边，放回了那个西瓜——然后**偷了一个熟的**。

这个故事讲起来容易接受，比起偷情或偷钱，偷西瓜似乎无伤大雅。但这恰恰说明了问题：我们对诚信的标准有多低，我们多容易让一些"小谎言"轻易滑过。

### 第一部分：诚信的反面是不诚实

诗篇15篇描述了一个正直的人：说真话、行公义、不受贿、即使吃亏也守约。

#### 1. 不要撒谎

耶稣在登山宝训中说："你们不可起誓……你们的话，是，就说是；不是，就说不是。"

什么意思？有些人认为只有在起誓时才必须说实话，平时可以打折扣。耶稣说：**不存在"真话的等级"**。你说的每一句"是"或"不是"，在神看来都是誓言。

马太福音12章说，我们要为每一句闲话交账。

想象一下，如果明天你的每句话都被录像，然后通过卫星向二十亿人播放，这会影响你明天说话的方式吗？当然会。但耶稣告诉我们：**你的实际处境比这更严重**，因为神在看着，祂的审判比二十亿人的意见重要得多。

#### 2. 不要违约

第4节说："他发了誓，虽然自己吃亏，也不更改。"

**什么是承诺？** 切斯特顿说，承诺是你与未来的自己定的约会。

当你承诺"我会爱你"，你是在说："我拒绝被我的基因、脑化学、社会或历史推来推去。无论发生什么，五年后我都会在那里。"

承诺带来自由，违约带来奴役。

托马斯·莫尔快要被烧死时，他的女儿恳求他收回承诺保命。莫尔说："梅格，当一个人起誓时，他把自己握在手中，就像握着水一样。如果他张开手指，就不要指望再找回自己了。"

### 第二部分：诚信的赝品是虚伪

诗篇15篇第2节不只说这人"说真话"，而是说他"**从心里说真话**"。

"诚信"（integrity）这个词和"整数"（integer）是同一个词根。整数是完整的数，不是分数。一个有诚信的人是**表里如一**的人。

虚伪（hypocrisy）在希腊语中是"演员"的意思。虚伪的人就是在演戏——外表一套，内心另一套。

我在南方牧会时，走进一个房间，人们在说："你知道是什么让这个国家伟大吗？工会！没有工会我们还在种稻子呢！"然后走进另一个房间，人们在说："你知道是什么在毁掉这个国家吗？工会！"

他们都问我："牧师，你说是不是？"我怎么回答的？我说："嗯，有道理……"

你看，我不是一个有诚信的人。

### 第三部分：如何培养诚信

诗篇15篇末尾说："行这些事的人，必永不动摇。"  
诗篇16篇中间说："我将耶和华常摆在我面前……我便不致动摇。"

**要过完全诚信的生活，必须将神常摆在你面前。**

#### 1. 认识到你需要神

谎言从哪里开始？从伊甸园开始。当亚当夏娃决定自己做主，不再完全依靠神，他们就与现实脱节了，**不得不开始躲藏**。这就是一切不诚实的根源。

为什么你那么难承认自己错了？  
为什么你总是要说服自己是某个人物？  
为什么你那么难听取批评？  
为什么你总是把问题怪到别人头上？

所有这些不诚实，都来自于**不愿承认我们需要神，不愿承认我们完全依靠祂**。

耶稣讲过一个比喻：两个儿子被叫去干活，一个说"我去"却没去，另一个说"我不去"却在最后时刻改变主意去了。哪个是顺服的？

法利赛人说是第二个。耶稣说："所以我告诉你们，税吏和娼妓倒比你们先进神的国。"

为什么？因为法利赛人不愿承认自己的软弱和罪。而**承认自己的不诚实，是诚实的开始**。

#### 2. 在耶稣里找到神

耶稣对彼拉多说："我就是真理。凡属真理的人就听我的话。"

知道真理是一回事，拥有真理是一回事，努力行真理是一回事——但**怎样才能让真理流淌在你的血管里**？

只有当你爱耶稣基督，祂的生命进入你、渗透你，只有当你活得好像神时刻在你面前，你才能过诚信的生活。

当你向祂敞开心扉，祂就向你敞开心扉，然后你才能向别人敞开心扉。只有那时，你才能过完全诚信的生活。

### 结语

你知道那意味着什么吗？  
意味着真诚到如此地步，简单到如此地步，你的心像一潭清澈的湖水，别人可以看到底。  
意味着你是一个有点严肃但又非常平易近人的人。  
人们可能会因为你的诚实而有点怕你，但他们会想和你打交道，因为他们知道你说话算话，因为他们知道你基本上是有爱心、公平的。

你是这样的人吗？

去找祂。向祂敞开心扉。将祂常摆在你面前，你就必永不动摇。

## English Transcript / 英文原文

today as Tim Keller explores one of the fruit of the Spirit. The reading for today is taken from the Book of Ephesians chapter 4 verses 14 and 15,  20 through 25 and verse 29. Then we will no longer be infants tossed back and forth by the waves  and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men  in their deceitful scheming. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up  into Him who is the head that is Christ. You, however, did not come to know Christ that way.

Surely you heard of Him and were taught in Him according with the truth that is in Jesus. You were taught with regard to your former way of life to put off your old self,  which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires, to be made new in the attitudes of your minds,  and to put on the new self created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness. Therefore, each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor,  for we are all members of one body. Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths,  but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs  that it may benefit those who will listen. This is the word of the Lord.

Galatians 5, verses 22 to 23, lists what's called the fruit of the Spirit. These are  characteristics, descriptors of a supernaturally changed heart, love, joy, peace, patience,  and we're looking at one each week so that perhaps we can have more of the supernatural change in our  own lives. Today we come to faithfulness. The word faithfulness is honesty, integrity, truthfulness,  and this is a great text that we're going to be looking at so we can take a deeper look at what  that means. There couldn't be a more relevant topic.

Because of the economic crisis, the recession,  and the revelations that have come out, since then, our trust, Americans trust of their  institutions, business, government, church, is that an all-time low, all the studies show that,  because there is a sense that there's been a failure of integrity in our society at all levels. And what does the Bible have to say about this, therefore, very relevant and all-important subject? This particular text is going to show us that there are two problems with regard to truth. There's  a problem of practicing truthfulness, but then there's also a problem of abusing people with  the truth. So there's a problem of practicing truth, and then there's a problem of abusing people  with the truth, and then we're going to see what the solution is, how we solve both problems.

Okay? First, first there's the problem of practicing truth. It's a very demanding thing,  according to the Bible, and what's great about this passage is there's three very important aspects  to being truthful people that are all mentioned. What does it mean to be truthful? First, it means  to refuse to deceive people, to not deceive people.

Notice verse 14 and 15, verse 15 says,  instead speak the truth, instead of what? And in verse 14 it says, cunning, craftiness, and deceit. Now, this is extremely important, because if you and I tend to think of lying strictly as conveying  inaccurate statements. But the Bible long ago understood what today is called speech act theory. You know what speech act theory is?

Speech act theory is the insight that every word is actually  also a deed. We tend to say word deed or two different things, but every word is really a deed. That is, every word is not only designed to convey information, it's also designed to get  something done. It's got an intention, it's got a purpose. And in order to evaluate a word,  or a phrase, you need to not only evaluate whether it's conveying fruit, accurate information,  but also evaluate what its purpose is.

So for example, there's been a theft at the office,  your office. And you know, Mr. A did it, but you want to protect and cover for Mr. A. So the  investigators come.

And you don't want to lie to them, see? And they say, who did it? What did you see? And you say, I saw Mr. B there that very night.

Is that a lie? Technically,  you're telling the per- you're saying what actually happened. It's factually true. Mr. B was there  that night.

You did see Mr. B there that night. But what's the purpose of this statement? It's misdirection. It's to hide.

It's to deceive. You're trying to get them to run down. You know,  you're throwing them a red herring. And therefore, what is, according to the Bible, an untruthful  word? An untruthful word is any word that deliberately tries to hide reality from the listener.

Every listener that asks you a question, if you lie to them, that means you are deliberately  withholding reality as you know it to be from them. And therefore, if you're deceiving, whether or  not what you said is technically true or not, that's a lie. And it's wrong. And as a result, by the  way, what that does mean is once you realize what the Bible is saying here, it does expand your  understanding. Does it not?

A untruthful speech? So somebody once made this little list, polite  lies, euphemisms, exaggerations, word inflation, and so-called benevolent lies. But they're all lies. So here's a polite lie. I would love to go, but I'll be out of town.

But you won't be out of town. Here's a euphemism. I think your writing is too sophisticated for our readers. When you mean  it's too terrible for our readers. But you don't want to say it's terrible.

You upset them. It's a  euphemism. It's a lie, see? Exaggeration. This works inside marriage.

You always, you never  went out, of course, that's not true because the person you are berating sometimes does  or sometimes does, but when you say you always, you never, what you're actually what speech act  theory here, you know, even if it's pretty much true, you're bludgeoning the person besides that  you're exaggerating. So the person's going to find the part of what you're saying that's wrong  and just going to inflame things. You're going to be up very late tonight. Or word inflation. And here's  something.

Now think about this, everybody. This is something that Christians do particularly,  but it can be done everywhere. Whenever public discourse in a church is, it was, it's such a blessing. The Lord was there. It was just incredible.

Now what happens is sometimes the Lord is there  and sometimes it is a blessing and sometimes it's incredible. When it's always a blessing,  it's always incredible. You're just creating cynicism, especially amongst your kids. Just creating cynicism. It's word inflation.

So what you're actually doing is it's not, it's  deceptive. It's just a way of always, it's hype. Hype is deceptive. Hype isn't reality. And then  you've got a whole pile of the little, what you call benevolent lies.

There's enabling  lives like when you continually lie for an incompetent friend, when you actually ought to be confronting  him or her about how they're living. Or then you have watergate lies. You know what watergate  lies are? Watergate lies are, well the little people wouldn't understand. It's just too complicated  for them.

So this is what I'm going to say. This is all deception. To live a life of truthfulness  means to refuse to deceive. Number one, number two. Secondly, to live a life of truthfulness  according to the Bible is to make and keep promises.

That actually comes out, though you might not  see it immediately, in verse 25. We should, if you're a Christian, you should tell the truth  everybody, of course. But in verse 25, it actually says, speak truthfully to your neighbor. Now that  might sound in that case like anybody, but then it says, for we are members of one body. And here  he's talking about Christian to Christian.

And that members of one body is a covenant image. A covenant is an agreement. A covenant is a commitment. A covenant is a public commitment you  enter into by signing a contract or making a promise. And here we're told the Christians are people  who are not afraid of.

They make and they keep promises. We live in a culture in which there is  so much emphasis on personal freedom, personal freedom, keeping your options open, that people no  longer make promises at places that they used to. And if they do make them, they feel very, very  free to break them as soon as it entails any self-denial at all. Let me just give you two examples  and I'll immediately backpile. Two examples of places where people used to make promises, but now  they don't make promises.

One is living together without being married. Secondly, being very involved  in the church without joining. In both cases, you're not making the promise that you used it. Now right  away, somebody is going to say, are you equating those two things? I am not equating them.

I'm not  saying they're equally wrong or bad. What I'm saying is 40 years ago, neither of them happened  very much. And the reason they didn't happen very much was because the idea of making a promise and  nailing it down and committing yourself in a sense, committing yourself and shutting down your  options wasn't considered the horrible thing that it is today, but it is. And so it permeates us  all. And one of the problems is that we actually think, one of the reasons is we're so big on  our freedom that we feel like if I make promises and I make commitments and I stick with them,  that somehow I lose my freedom and that is not true at all.

Lewis Meads, in his great book,  Mayor Morality, which is an exhibition of the Ten Commandments, talks about this at one place. He's talking about making promises and keeping commitments and taking vows. And he's thinking,  you can hear when he talks about it, he's thinking somewhat about the marriage vow, but he's actually  what he's saying in this quote, is true of all promises and all commitments. He says this,  when we make a promise, we take it on ourselves to create a future with someone else, no matter  what fate or destiny may have in store. This is almost ultimate freedom.

When I make a promise,  I bear witness that my future with you is not determined by the hand I was dealt out of my  family's genetic deck. When I make a promise, I testify that I was not routed along some  unalterable itinerary by the psychic conditioning visited on me by my slightly wacky parents. I am not faded, I am not determined, I am not a lump of human dough whipped into shape by the  contingent reinforcement and averse of conditioning in my past. Now I know as well as the next person  that much of what I am and what I do is a gift or a curse from my past, but when I make a promise to  anyone, I rise above all the conditioning that limits me, no German shepherd ever promised  to be there with me, no computer ever promised to be loyal for life, only a person can make a promise  and when he does, he is most free. You see, when you say, but if I make that promise, if I make that  commitment, if I promise to be there, then I won't have my freedom, and what he's saying is the  opposite, don't you realize that if you don't make a promise, then you are a slave to circumstances,  you're a slave to feelings, you're a slave to fears, you're a slave to impulses, make a promise.

And that's your way of saying, this is the way I'm going to be and I don't care about whatever else  happens, and that makes you more free. And to be people of integrity, we should be people who are  not afraid of making promises and keeping promises. So refusing to deceive, making keeping promises  and the third aspect of what it means to practice the truth and be truthful is integrity of selves,  plural, integrity of selves. Look at verse 25, where it says, therefore each of you must put off  falsehood. But you know what it says in the original Greek is, you must put off the pseudo.

That's the Greek word, the pseudo. And this is what he is talking about. Think of the word integrity. In English, it's the same as the word integer. What is an integer?

It's a whole number,  not a fraction, something that can't be divided. It's a whole number. What is integrity? A person  of integrity has the same self in every place. You don't have a pseudo self in a real self.

So for example, a person who lacks integrity is one way in private and another way in public. This is the reason why politicians should be really careful about those live microphones. You're one way in private and another way in public. Without integrity, you are one way with this  group and a total another way with this group. You talk a completely different line than this,  what you say, what you say you believe, it's totally different.

A person of integrity, however,  is the same in private as in public. The same with this group as with that group. The same in what  you think with what you say and the same with what you say with what you do. You don't have multiple  selves, a real self and a bunch of pseudo selves. You've got one self, one real self.

And boys is lacking. If I had time, I would talk about all the cultural reasons why  we're actually encouraged by the culture to create totally different selves. What do you think? What do you think all those internet names are? You create totally different selves.

We're encouraged  by it. But let me just give you one example of how devastating it is in just one area, which I  mentioned at the top, which is business. A man who was some years ago just writing a book on  how to have integrity as a business leader just wrote these things. Now, I just pulled them off  because they're routine, but they also are very revealing. He says, don't say publicly where for quality,  but privately you have unreasonable deadlines and all your employees know it.

Don't take friends to company box seats when everybody knows you should only be bringing clients  there. Don't say publicly everything is fine when all your employees know everything is not fine. Don't give huge perks to management and not to others. Don't put in a big number of orders  right before the end of the quarter because even though you know they will all be cancelled,  it will look so good in the figures for the quarter. When you hear that kind of thing,  you suddenly realize, oh my word, we just swim in that.

I'm back to the illustration. Don't ask a fish  to tell you about water because then the fish will say, well, what's water? Because the fish is so  in the water, the fish doesn't even see the earth's water. And maybe we're getting to the  place where we can't even say to people in business, in government, in the church, in real life,  just life, be people of integrity because they don't even know what that is because they're so used  to the kind of behavior that this man said, don't do, don't do, but we just swim in it. It's just everywhere.

All through this passage, the reason why we should be truthful comes back to God. Does it not? We should be righteous and truthful and holy because God is truthful and righteous and holy. And the implication of that, if you're a Christian believer, is astonishing. There's a place  in the Sermon on the Mount.

When you read through the Sermon on the Mount, a lot of this stuff makes  sense. When you get to this place, it doesn't seem to make sense. It's about oaths. And there's a place  where Jesus says, don't swear by the city of Jerusalem and don't swear by your head, but let your  yes be yes, and let your no be no. And you say, what?

And here's what he meant by that. In those days, it was understood or believed that if you swore by God, the name of God,  then you couldn't ever break your oath. That probably goes to their understanding of the 10  commandments, which says, you must not take the name of the Lord that God invades, which means  you must never take the name of God on and then not follow through. If you invoke God's name,  then you better follow through. But they said, if you swear on something else, if you swear on  your father's grave, or if you swear on the city of Jerusalem, or if you swear on your own head,  that's different.

If you make a promise like that, it's not so bad if you break it. And you know what  Jesus is saying, don't you dare believe that. He says, don't you understand? Jerusalem is God's  city. Your head is God's, God made your head.

Your father's grave is God's. He says, don't you realize  that every yes and every no, everything you say every day, every idle word is under oath,  as much under oath as if you were because you are standing before the throne of the great king. Absolutely, there's no levels of truthfulness. Absolutely, everything you say is actually under oath. If I told you that tomorrow somebody's going to follow you around and it's going to video,  every single thing you do and every single thing you say, would you speak with more integrity?

Would you be more careful? How you spoke to your spouse or to your friends or to the person  that you're pitching a deal to, a prospective client, would you be at all more careful? If you knew it was being recorded and then tomorrow it was going to be put up on the internet,  would you be more careful? I would and you would. And if we're Christians, we're fools.

Because it's true that we would be more careful. And yet Jesus Christ says, don't you realize you're  you're under way more scrutiny than that. Every single one of your words is being held a far greater  accountability than a few thousand people watching it on the internet. God, the God of truth, the God  of righteousness, the God of holiness, you're standing right before Him. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God.

Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face  every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365-day devotional, the Songs of Jesus,  you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a regular  devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start. And if you already spend time in study  and prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest emotions and  questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with Him. We'll send you Tim and Kathy  Keller's devotional is our thanks for your gift to help gospel and life share the love of Jesus  with more people.

So you see the problem and the difficulty of practicing the truth, but that's not the only problem  that Paul brings out here. It's not the only problem with regard to the truth. There's a second problem  and it's fascinating to me.

He hints at it in verse 15. When he doesn't just say,  instead speak the truth in love. He doesn't just say speak the truth. He says speak the truth in love. Doesn't just say speak the truth.

He says in love. Okay, well that's nice. When you look at that,  you kind of think, okay, so be truthful but add love. So truth is one thing and love is another  thing. But when you get down to verse 29, the last verse, then you see how remarkable what a  remarkable point Paul is making because he says, do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your  mouth.

That word unwholesome literally means rotten. It's a word that means putrefying. It's a word  that means leading to decay and disintegration. Okay. And then so what is an unwholesome word?

An  unwholesome word is anything that is not supposed, is not designed to build up, not designed to benefit. And you say, what does that mean? The true words that are not designed to build up and benefit  the person. Even true words are rotten. And the answer is yes, that's what Paul is saying.

Rotten. So what are unwholesome words? What does this mean? Well on the one hand, you know,  I still always am, I'm always amazed by the one place in Henry V in the play, the Shakespeare play  Henry V when he's just hung a man for, you know, he's, they're invading France and the  English are invading France and he hangs a man for pillaging, I think. And at one point, he turns  around and he actually says to all of his soldiers, he says, I will not have the French  upgraded nor abused in disdainful language.

Okay. Yeah, we're here to conquer them but we're not. We're not going to speak disdainfully. We're not going to abrade them. Now that clearly is what it  means, but I believe Paul is not just talking about abusive, you know, angry harsh tones, though  he certainly is saying that.

If you say the truth, in abusive, harsh, angry ways,  that's rotten, that stinks, that's wrong, that's sinful. What I'm telling the truth, it doesn't  matter and here's the reason why. When you tell the truth in abusive ways, when you beat people  up with the truth, are you really caring about the truth? Are you really valiant for the truth? No,  you're valiant for yourself.

But Paul's not only talking about, I think, overtly abusive  words. He is saying anything that's not actually designed to benefit and build up. That's amazing. When you tell the truth to somebody, is your goal? Here we are back to speech act theory.

Okay,  maybe what you're saying is true, technically true, doctrinally true, you know, accurate,  but are you trying to marginalize the person in the eyes of others? Are you trying to beat the  person up? Are you trying to punish them? Are you trying to put them in their place? Are you trying  to get applause from other people because you're being so hard on them?

Paul says none of those  are right. Anyone who uses the truth basically to beat the person up in order to get more power and  status for yourself is abusing the truth. And you're not valiant for the truth, you're valiant for  yourself. You're using the truth for your own power and status. And at this point, by the way,  you realize that we're coming to a place where we're coming to one of the main objections  that the world out there today, especially in our culture, has about the church.

Foucault, Nietzsche, those kinds of people, have said now for years that when Christians claim  to have the truth, they're really basically just using the truth to get on top. So Foucault is a famous place where the French philosopher Foucault says truth is a thing of this  world. It is produced by virtue of multiple forms of constraint and it induces regular effects of  power. Each society has its regime of truth. He says basically truth claims our power plays.

Now  what should Christians do when they hear that? I'll tell you what they should do according to the  Bible. The first thing they should do is not get their backup and say, wait a minute, there really  is absolute truth. They should repent. And here's why.

Long before Foucault, long before Nietzsche,  long before Marx, Jesus said this, he says, woe to you Pharisees because you love the most important  seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces. Woe to you because you load people down  with burdens they can hardly bear but do not lift a finger to help them. What's he talking about? He's  talking about people who use the law of God, the truth, the Bible to get the place, the right places  in society, the high status, and to keep people down. That's exactly what Foucault and exactly  with Nietzsche.

Yes. See Jesus Christ years ago used the gospel to dismantle what Paul is talking  about and what so many people in the world who don't like Christianity complain about. If you get  your sense of worth and value out of the free grace of God, if the reason why you know  you're worth anything is just the free love and grace of God. Then the truth of God just becomes a  way of delighting him. It's something you love.

So if you get your sense of value from the grace  of God, you love the truth. But if you get your sense of value from being right,  if you get your sense of value and worth from having the truth and being accurate and being  value for the truth instead of God, you say you're looking to the truth to give you what only God  can give you. A sense that you must be a valuable important person because you know the truth so  well and so forth. See Jesus years ago called that moralism, Phariseism,  and dismantled it. And therefore Christians are in some ways standing on a very narrow piece of  ground.

In fact, to most of the roads invisible because over here you have people who basically say  who's to say what truth is? What is truth? You know everybody has to decide what truth is for him  or herself. They either deny the fact that there is truth or they play fast and loose with the  truth. And on the other side you've got people who say yes there is truth and here's absolute  truth and they beat people up with it and Jesus says Paul says both of those are rotten.

And if you're a person of integrity you don't do either. And a person who uses the truth  to beat people up is not really valid for the truth, you're valid for yourself. And you know the  non-Christian thinkers out there see it and know it. So there are the two problems. You know the one hand we're afraid we're afraid to be truthful.

You know what's you know what's  hard about about telling truth all the time. You know what's hard about keeping promises and  making promises. You know what's hard about integrity. It's scary. You know it's scary.

I mean if I  tell the truth all the time if I just let everybody up but then you know we're afraid and that's  why we lie. That's why I have always lied. When I lie I lie because I'm afraid. But on another hand you have pride. You know smart Luther said that the Christians are like a drunk  man who having fallen off of the horse on the one side promptly gets up on the horse and falls  off on the other.

And so we are now stuck between I would cook I would have to say two cultures. Listen to me. On the one hand we really do have a problem. We have a culture that is  relativistic. It really is.

They do say who's to say what is truth. Nobody can say what is right  wrong. All truth and morality is culturally relative. Now one of the bad problems we have there  and it's almost a joke is then we get real upset. We tell kids there is no right or wrong.

You have  to decide yourself. There is no such thing as truth and then we get all upset when they get out  into society and they lie and they cheat. C.S. Lewis in his abolition of man puts it like this. We clamor for the very qualities we are rendering impossible.

We laugh at honor. You know we laugh  at the idea of honor and truth. We laugh at honor and are shocked to find traders in our midst. We castrate and bid the gildings be fruitful. And he's what he's saying there.

He says we tell kids  all truth and morality is culturally relative. Who's to say what is truth and then it says we clamor  for the very qualities we are rendering impossible. Look at all this corruption. Look at all these people  cheating. Look at all these people not being honest.

Truth is relative but why aren't you honest? We clamor for the very qualities we are rendering impossible. We laugh at honor and are shocked  to find traders in our midst. We castrate them and then we build the gildings be fruitful and develop  virtue and honesty and integrity and they can't. And so on the one hand we are living in a society  like that but therefore the danger is to react and become people who use unwholesome words.

People who use the truth not to build up and not to benefit. You know we attack not the problem  but the person when we use the truth. So we have the truth party. We have the truth and nobody  else. And we have the love party.

Ah this just accept everybody but here's the problem. Truth  without love is not really truth. It is a power grab and love without truth is not really love. It's  cowardice or intellectual laziness. Truth and love have to be together or they're not themselves.

Got that? That's what Paul is saying here. Love without truth isn't truth and truth without love. Truth that love isn't truth and love without truth isn't love. Unless they're together they're not  themselves.

So what are we going to do? Here's what we're going to do. In John chapter 18 I just  noticed this this week there's really two trials. Jesus first is dragged before the high priest  before they you know before his crucifixion he's dragged before the high priest and they  religious leaders and then the same chapters drag before pilot. Now when he's dragged before  the high priest you know what he says?

High testified to the truth and they smack him. But then when he gets in front of pilot he uses almost exactly the same words I testified to the truth. And you know what pilot says? What is truth? And then they kill him.

I want you to behold the  wonder of this. First of all I want you to behold the wonder of the integrity of Jesus. Jesus  Christ, what a man of integrity. Why? He's the same both places.

There's no pseudo about Jesus. He's the same in one place as another. Here's the moralists, right? The people that he has  the religious leaders that he has been denouncing as moralists. Here's the moralists.

He says the  same thing. Here's the relativists. What is truth says pilot and he's exactly the same. He's not  two different kinds of people and notice this. He's not only the same in both places but they both  hate him.

They both smack him. They both kill him. Why? Because here's what's so weird. The  relativists and the moralists both are about power.

The reason the relativists says who's to say  what truth is is to get power. The reason why the moralist says I have the truth is about power. But Jesus Christ is the exact opposite. He is standing on his integrity, absolute integrity. I  testify the truth.

He says the same and it gets him killed. Why? Because he's using the truth to  serve us. They're using the truth to get power over us. His integrity took him to the cross.

But why did he want to go to the cross? And here is the solution. May I ask you a question? Did Jesus Christ go to the cross for truth? Was that why he went?

To show that God's law cannot be broken. To show that God's holiness and  his righteousness has to be satisfied. Did Jesus Christ go to the cross for the sake of the truth? Or did Jesus Christ go to the cross for the sake of love so that we could be pardoned so we could  be forgiven in spite of our sins? So we could be embraced so we could be accepted.

Okay everybody. Did Jesus Christ go to the cross for truth or did Jesus Christ go to the cross for  love? And the answer is yes. The minute he died, the truth of God was infinitely satisfied because  he fulfilled all the requirements of the love God. But the minute Jesus died, the love of God  was infinitely satisfied because now he can embrace us and pardon us and forgive us and receive us  in spite of our sins.

The cross brought truth and love together. I know in the world and sometimes  in our lives it seems like they're at loggerheads. But if I tell the truth, I don't know if that's  loving or if I really, in other words they seem at loggerheads but on the cross they were not at  loggerheads and when the cross comes into the center of your life they won't be either. You know why? It keeps you from the fear that makes you a person who plays fast and loses the truth because  Jesus Christ loved you so much that he died for you, but it also keeps you from the pride that makes  you a person who might abuse with the truth because Jesus Christ had to die for you.

You're that  sinful. So the pride that leads you to abuse people with the truth is taken away by the cross. The fear that leads us to duck and dive and play with the truth is taken away. Our hearts are so  filled with love that here's what we can do. Verse 29, I know that the translation says you should  only do what will benefit those who listen but literally the Greek says you should only say that  which will give grace to those who listen.

When you get the grace from the cross of Jesus Christ  then you can speak the truth graciously and only then or you could put it one other way. Yeah,  as Mr. Incredible once said, I got time. We can do one, let me tell you one more thing. In the beginning, don't think about that too much.

In the beginning of history, it was a disaster. Adam and Eve, you know, Garden of Eden, what happens? Sin, serpent, you know the story. Everything's horrible, death, destruction, evil, everything's horrible except there's a glimmer of  hope. You know what it is?

It's a promise. Genesis 3, 15, God says, I promise that one descendant of  Eve is someday going to bruise the head of the serpent, destroy evil. I promise. Scroll forward  centuries later. God starts talking to Abram says, I'm going to say the world through your descendants  and one night Abram says, but how can I be sure?

And in Genesis 15, God shocks Abraham and he  shocks anybody who understands what he's doing in Genesis 15 when he appears and he passes between  the pieces of a dead animal and he says, I will save the world through one of your descendants  even if it means I have to die. A second promise. And then years later, Jesus Christ comes into  the world and he's a man of complete integrity, complete integrity. He always means what he says,  always says what he means, absolute integrity, but at the very end in the ultimate act of integrity,  he sets his face like a flint to go to Jerusalem and he goes to the cross, why? He's fulfilling his  promise.

He's fulfilling the promise of God. And everything's before him. Everything comes down. Everything opposes him. Hell itself comes down and he says, no, I've made a promise and he  goes to the cross and he dies for us.

You've been saved by the integrity of Jesus. You've been  saved by the promise keeping of Jesus Christ. That should humble us away from ever using truth  against people, but on the other hand, it convinces us there is a truth where we can't be  at all. And it destroys our fear of telling the truth and therefore, oh, friends, look at the  integrity of Jesus, look at what he did for you on the cross and become people of integrity. Let's pray.

Thank you, Father, for giving us this vision of Jesus Christ who kept all his promises. He was a man of integrity. He used the truth to save us, not to exploit us. Our Father, when we deny the truth or fail to speak the truth, to save our next,  or when we abuse people with the truth, to get the power and status we want, we are just  turning our eyes away from your Son. Who was the way the truth and the life,  but who on the cross gave us forever a vision of how truth and love are joined together.

They're one flesh, never to be parted, and we pray that the vision of what Jesus did on the cross  would enable the truth and love to grow in our own lives, go hand in hand. We pray you make us a  community of integrity. We pray that you'd help us to know how to speak the truth in our culture  right now that doesn't want to hear it. We pray, Lord, that you would help us to know what it  needs to be, people of integrity. We ask this in Jesus' name, amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today as Tim Keller explores one of the fruit of the Spirit. The reading for today is taken from the Book of Ephesians chapter 4 verses 14 and 15,  20 through 25 and verse 29. Then we will no longer be infants tossed back and forth by the waves  and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men  in their deceitful scheming. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up  into Him who is the head that is Christ. You, however, did not come to know Christ that way.

Surely you heard of Him and were taught in Him according with the truth that is in Jesus. You were taught with regard to your former way of life to put off your old self,  which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires, to be made new in the attitudes of your minds,  and to put on the new self created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness. Therefore, each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor,  for we are all members of one body. Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths,  but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs  that it may benefit those who will listen. This is the word of the Lord.

Galatians 5, verses 22 to 23, lists what's called the fruit of the Spirit. These are  characteristics, descriptors of a supernaturally changed heart, love, joy, peace, patience,  and we're looking at one each week so that perhaps we can have more of the supernatural change in our  own lives. Today we come to faithfulness. The word faithfulness is honesty, integrity, truthfulness,  and this is a great text that we're going to be looking at so we can take a deeper look at what  that means. There couldn't be a more relevant topic.

Because of the economic crisis, the recession,  and the revelations that have come out, since then, our trust, Americans trust of their  institutions, business, government, church, is that an all-time low, all the studies show that,  because there is a sense that there's been a failure of integrity in our society at all levels. And what does the Bible have to say about this, therefore, very relevant and all-important subject? This particular text is going to show us that there are two problems with regard to truth. There's  a problem of practicing truthfulness, but then there's also a problem of abusing people with  the truth. So there's a problem of practicing truth, and then there's a problem of abusing people  with the truth, and then we're going to see what the solution is, how we solve both problems.

Okay? First, first there's the problem of practicing truth. It's a very demanding thing,  according to the Bible, and what's great about this passage is there's three very important aspects  to being truthful people that are all mentioned. What does it mean to be truthful? First, it means  to refuse to deceive people, to not deceive people.

Notice verse 14 and 15, verse 15 says,  instead speak the truth, instead of what? And in verse 14 it says, cunning, craftiness, and deceit. Now, this is extremely important, because if you and I tend to think of lying strictly as conveying  inaccurate statements. But the Bible long ago understood what today is called speech act theory. You know what speech act theory is?

Speech act theory is the insight that every word is actually  also a deed. We tend to say word deed or two different things, but every word is really a deed. That is, every word is not only designed to convey information, it's also designed to get  something done. It's got an intention, it's got a purpose. And in order to evaluate a word,  or a phrase, you need to not only evaluate whether it's conveying fruit, accurate information,  but also evaluate what its purpose is.

So for example, there's been a theft at the office,  your office. And you know, Mr. A did it, but you want to protect and cover for Mr. A. So the  investigators come.

And you don't want to lie to them, see? And they say, who did it? What did you see? And you say, I saw Mr. B there that very night.

Is that a lie? Technically,  you're telling the per- you're saying what actually happened. It's factually true. Mr. B was there  that night.

You did see Mr. B there that night. But what's the purpose of this statement? It's misdirection. It's to hide.

It's to deceive. You're trying to get them to run down. You know,  you're throwing them a red herring. And therefore, what is, according to the Bible, an untruthful  word? An untruthful word is any word that deliberately tries to hide reality from the listener.

Every listener that asks you a question, if you lie to them, that means you are deliberately  withholding reality as you know it to be from them. And therefore, if you're deceiving, whether or  not what you said is technically true or not, that's a lie. And it's wrong. And as a result, by the  way, what that does mean is once you realize what the Bible is saying here, it does expand your  understanding. Does it not?

A untruthful speech? So somebody once made this little list, polite  lies, euphemisms, exaggerations, word inflation, and so-called benevolent lies. But they're all lies. So here's a polite lie. I would love to go, but I'll be out of town.

But you won't be out of town. Here's a euphemism. I think your writing is too sophisticated for our readers. When you mean  it's too terrible for our readers. But you don't want to say it's terrible.

You upset them. It's a  euphemism. It's a lie, see? Exaggeration. This works inside marriage.

You always, you never  went out, of course, that's not true because the person you are berating sometimes does  or sometimes does, but when you say you always, you never, what you're actually what speech act  theory here, you know, even if it's pretty much true, you're bludgeoning the person besides that  you're exaggerating. So the person's going to find the part of what you're saying that's wrong  and just going to inflame things. You're going to be up very late tonight. Or word inflation. And here's  something.

Now think about this, everybody. This is something that Christians do particularly,  but it can be done everywhere. Whenever public discourse in a church is, it was, it's such a blessing. The Lord was there. It was just incredible.

Now what happens is sometimes the Lord is there  and sometimes it is a blessing and sometimes it's incredible. When it's always a blessing,  it's always incredible. You're just creating cynicism, especially amongst your kids. Just creating cynicism. It's word inflation.

So what you're actually doing is it's not, it's  deceptive. It's just a way of always, it's hype. Hype is deceptive. Hype isn't reality. And then  you've got a whole pile of the little, what you call benevolent lies.

There's enabling  lives like when you continually lie for an incompetent friend, when you actually ought to be confronting  him or her about how they're living. Or then you have watergate lies. You know what watergate  lies are? Watergate lies are, well the little people wouldn't understand. It's just too complicated  for them.

So this is what I'm going to say. This is all deception. To live a life of truthfulness  means to refuse to deceive. Number one, number two. Secondly, to live a life of truthfulness  according to the Bible is to make and keep promises.

That actually comes out, though you might not  see it immediately, in verse 25. We should, if you're a Christian, you should tell the truth  everybody, of course. But in verse 25, it actually says, speak truthfully to your neighbor. Now that  might sound in that case like anybody, but then it says, for we are members of one body. And here  he's talking about Christian to Christian.

And that members of one body is a covenant image. A covenant is an agreement. A covenant is a commitment. A covenant is a public commitment you  enter into by signing a contract or making a promise. And here we're told the Christians are people  who are not afraid of.

They make and they keep promises. We live in a culture in which there is  so much emphasis on personal freedom, personal freedom, keeping your options open, that people no  longer make promises at places that they used to. And if they do make them, they feel very, very  free to break them as soon as it entails any self-denial at all. Let me just give you two examples  and I'll immediately backpile. Two examples of places where people used to make promises, but now  they don't make promises.

One is living together without being married. Secondly, being very involved  in the church without joining. In both cases, you're not making the promise that you used it. Now right  away, somebody is going to say, are you equating those two things? I am not equating them.

I'm not  saying they're equally wrong or bad. What I'm saying is 40 years ago, neither of them happened  very much. And the reason they didn't happen very much was because the idea of making a promise and  nailing it down and committing yourself in a sense, committing yourself and shutting down your  options wasn't considered the horrible thing that it is today, but it is. And so it permeates us  all. And one of the problems is that we actually think, one of the reasons is we're so big on  our freedom that we feel like if I make promises and I make commitments and I stick with them,  that somehow I lose my freedom and that is not true at all.

Lewis Meads, in his great book,  Mayor Morality, which is an exhibition of the Ten Commandments, talks about this at one place. He's talking about making promises and keeping commitments and taking vows. And he's thinking,  you can hear when he talks about it, he's thinking somewhat about the marriage vow, but he's actually  what he's saying in this quote, is true of all promises and all commitments. He says this,  when we make a promise, we take it on ourselves to create a future with someone else, no matter  what fate or destiny may have in store. This is almost ultimate freedom.

When I make a promise,  I bear witness that my future with you is not determined by the hand I was dealt out of my  family's genetic deck. When I make a promise, I testify that I was not routed along some  unalterable itinerary by the psychic conditioning visited on me by my slightly wacky parents. I am not faded, I am not determined, I am not a lump of human dough whipped into shape by the  contingent reinforcement and averse of conditioning in my past. Now I know as well as the next person  that much of what I am and what I do is a gift or a curse from my past, but when I make a promise to  anyone, I rise above all the conditioning that limits me, no German shepherd ever promised  to be there with me, no computer ever promised to be loyal for life, only a person can make a promise  and when he does, he is most free. You see, when you say, but if I make that promise, if I make that  commitment, if I promise to be there, then I won't have my freedom, and what he's saying is the  opposite, don't you realize that if you don't make a promise, then you are a slave to circumstances,  you're a slave to feelings, you're a slave to fears, you're a slave to impulses, make a promise.

And that's your way of saying, this is the way I'm going to be and I don't care about whatever else  happens, and that makes you more free. And to be people of integrity, we should be people who are  not afraid of making promises and keeping promises. So refusing to deceive, making keeping promises  and the third aspect of what it means to practice the truth and be truthful is integrity of selves,  plural, integrity of selves. Look at verse 25, where it says, therefore each of you must put off  falsehood. But you know what it says in the original Greek is, you must put off the pseudo.

That's the Greek word, the pseudo. And this is what he is talking about. Think of the word integrity. In English, it's the same as the word integer. What is an integer?

It's a whole number,  not a fraction, something that can't be divided. It's a whole number. What is integrity? A person  of integrity has the same self in every place. You don't have a pseudo self in a real self.

So for example, a person who lacks integrity is one way in private and another way in public. This is the reason why politicians should be really careful about those live microphones. You're one way in private and another way in public. Without integrity, you are one way with this  group and a total another way with this group. You talk a completely different line than this,  what you say, what you say you believe, it's totally different.

A person of integrity, however,  is the same in private as in public. The same with this group as with that group. The same in what  you think with what you say and the same with what you say with what you do. You don't have multiple  selves, a real self and a bunch of pseudo selves. You've got one self, one real self.

And boys is lacking. If I had time, I would talk about all the cultural reasons why  we're actually encouraged by the culture to create totally different selves. What do you think? What do you think all those internet names are? You create totally different selves.

We're encouraged  by it. But let me just give you one example of how devastating it is in just one area, which I  mentioned at the top, which is business. A man who was some years ago just writing a book on  how to have integrity as a business leader just wrote these things. Now, I just pulled them off  because they're routine, but they also are very revealing. He says, don't say publicly where for quality,  but privately you have unreasonable deadlines and all your employees know it.

Don't take friends to company box seats when everybody knows you should only be bringing clients  there. Don't say publicly everything is fine when all your employees know everything is not fine. Don't give huge perks to management and not to others. Don't put in a big number of orders  right before the end of the quarter because even though you know they will all be cancelled,  it will look so good in the figures for the quarter. When you hear that kind of thing,  you suddenly realize, oh my word, we just swim in that.

I'm back to the illustration. Don't ask a fish  to tell you about water because then the fish will say, well, what's water? Because the fish is so  in the water, the fish doesn't even see the earth's water. And maybe we're getting to the  place where we can't even say to people in business, in government, in the church, in real life,  just life, be people of integrity because they don't even know what that is because they're so used  to the kind of behavior that this man said, don't do, don't do, but we just swim in it. It's just everywhere.

All through this passage, the reason why we should be truthful comes back to God. Does it not? We should be righteous and truthful and holy because God is truthful and righteous and holy. And the implication of that, if you're a Christian believer, is astonishing. There's a place  in the Sermon on the Mount.

When you read through the Sermon on the Mount, a lot of this stuff makes  sense. When you get to this place, it doesn't seem to make sense. It's about oaths. And there's a place  where Jesus says, don't swear by the city of Jerusalem and don't swear by your head, but let your  yes be yes, and let your no be no. And you say, what?

And here's what he meant by that. In those days, it was understood or believed that if you swore by God, the name of God,  then you couldn't ever break your oath. That probably goes to their understanding of the 10  commandments, which says, you must not take the name of the Lord that God invades, which means  you must never take the name of God on and then not follow through. If you invoke God's name,  then you better follow through. But they said, if you swear on something else, if you swear on  your father's grave, or if you swear on the city of Jerusalem, or if you swear on your own head,  that's different.

If you make a promise like that, it's not so bad if you break it. And you know what  Jesus is saying, don't you dare believe that. He says, don't you understand? Jerusalem is God's  city. Your head is God's, God made your head.

Your father's grave is God's. He says, don't you realize  that every yes and every no, everything you say every day, every idle word is under oath,  as much under oath as if you were because you are standing before the throne of the great king. Absolutely, there's no levels of truthfulness. Absolutely, everything you say is actually under oath. If I told you that tomorrow somebody's going to follow you around and it's going to video,  every single thing you do and every single thing you say, would you speak with more integrity?

Would you be more careful? How you spoke to your spouse or to your friends or to the person  that you're pitching a deal to, a prospective client, would you be at all more careful? If you knew it was being recorded and then tomorrow it was going to be put up on the internet,  would you be more careful? I would and you would. And if we're Christians, we're fools.

Because it's true that we would be more careful. And yet Jesus Christ says, don't you realize you're  you're under way more scrutiny than that. Every single one of your words is being held a far greater  accountability than a few thousand people watching it on the internet. God, the God of truth, the God  of righteousness, the God of holiness, you're standing right before Him. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God.

Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face  every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365-day devotional, the Songs of Jesus,  you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a regular  devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start. And if you already spend time in study  and prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest emotions and  questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with Him.

So you see the problem and the difficulty of practicing the truth, but that's not the only problem  that Paul brings out here. It's not the only problem with regard to the truth. There's a second problem  and it's fascinating to me.

He hints at it in verse 15. When he doesn't just say,  instead speak the truth in love. He doesn't just say speak the truth. He says speak the truth in love. Doesn't just say speak the truth.

He says in love. Okay, well that's nice. When you look at that,  you kind of think, okay, so be truthful but add love. So truth is one thing and love is another  thing. But when you get down to verse 29, the last verse, then you see how remarkable what a  remarkable point Paul is making because he says, do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your  mouth.

That word unwholesome literally means rotten. It's a word that means putrefying. It's a word  that means leading to decay and disintegration. Okay. And then so what is an unwholesome word?

An  unwholesome word is anything that is not supposed, is not designed to build up, not designed to benefit. And you say, what does that mean? The true words that are not designed to build up and benefit  the person. Even true words are rotten. And the answer is yes, that's what Paul is saying.

Rotten. So what are unwholesome words? What does this mean? Well on the one hand, you know,  I still always am, I'm always amazed by the one place in Henry V in the play, the Shakespeare play  Henry V when he's just hung a man for, you know, he's, they're invading France and the  English are invading France and he hangs a man for pillaging, I think. And at one point, he turns  around and he actually says to all of his soldiers, he says, I will not have the French  upgraded nor abused in disdainful language.

Okay. Yeah, we're here to conquer them but we're not. We're not going to speak disdainfully. We're not going to abrade them. Now that clearly is what it  means, but I believe Paul is not just talking about abusive, you know, angry harsh tones, though  he certainly is saying that.

If you say the truth, in abusive, harsh, angry ways,  that's rotten, that stinks, that's wrong, that's sinful. What I'm telling the truth, it doesn't  matter and here's the reason why. When you tell the truth in abusive ways, when you beat people  up with the truth, are you really caring about the truth? Are you really valiant for the truth? No,  you're valiant for yourself.

But Paul's not only talking about, I think, overtly abusive  words. He is saying anything that's not actually designed to benefit and build up. That's amazing. When you tell the truth to somebody, is your goal? Here we are back to speech act theory.

Okay,  maybe what you're saying is true, technically true, doctrinally true, you know, accurate,  but are you trying to marginalize the person in the eyes of others? Are you trying to beat the  person up? Are you trying to punish them? Are you trying to put them in their place? Are you trying  to get applause from other people because you're being so hard on them?

Paul says none of those  are right. Anyone who uses the truth basically to beat the person up in order to get more power and  status for yourself is abusing the truth. And you're not valiant for the truth, you're valiant for  yourself. You're using the truth for your own power and status. And at this point, by the way,  you realize that we're coming to a place where we're coming to one of the main objections  that the world out there today, especially in our culture, has about the church.

Foucault, Nietzsche, those kinds of people, have said now for years that when Christians claim  to have the truth, they're really basically just using the truth to get on top. So Foucault is a famous place where the French philosopher Foucault says truth is a thing of this  world. It is produced by virtue of multiple forms of constraint and it induces regular effects of  power. Each society has its regime of truth. He says basically truth claims our power plays.

Now  what should Christians do when they hear that? I'll tell you what they should do according to the  Bible. The first thing they should do is not get their backup and say, wait a minute, there really  is absolute truth. They should repent. And here's why.

Long before Foucault, long before Nietzsche,  long before Marx, Jesus said this, he says, woe to you Pharisees because you love the most important  seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces. Woe to you because you load people down  with burdens they can hardly bear but do not lift a finger to help them. What's he talking about? He's  talking about people who use the law of God, the truth, the Bible to get the place, the right places  in society, the high status, and to keep people down. That's exactly what Foucault and exactly  with Nietzsche.

Yes. See Jesus Christ years ago used the gospel to dismantle what Paul is talking  about and what so many people in the world who don't like Christianity complain about. If you get  your sense of worth and value out of the free grace of God, if the reason why you know  you're worth anything is just the free love and grace of God. Then the truth of God just becomes a  way of delighting him. It's something you love.

So if you get your sense of value from the grace  of God, you love the truth. But if you get your sense of value from being right,  if you get your sense of value and worth from having the truth and being accurate and being  value for the truth instead of God, you say you're looking to the truth to give you what only God  can give you. A sense that you must be a valuable important person because you know the truth so  well and so forth. See Jesus years ago called that moralism, Phariseism,  and dismantled it. And therefore Christians are in some ways standing on a very narrow piece of  ground.

In fact, to most of the roads invisible because over here you have people who basically say  who's to say what truth is? What is truth? You know everybody has to decide what truth is for him  or herself. They either deny the fact that there is truth or they play fast and loose with the  truth. And on the other side you've got people who say yes there is truth and here's absolute  truth and they beat people up with it and Jesus says Paul says both of those are rotten.

And if you're a person of integrity you don't do either. And a person who uses the truth  to beat people up is not really valid for the truth, you're valid for yourself. And you know the  non-Christian thinkers out there see it and know it. So there are the two problems. You know the one hand we're afraid we're afraid to be truthful.

You know what's you know what's  hard about about telling truth all the time. You know what's hard about keeping promises and  making promises. You know what's hard about integrity. It's scary. You know it's scary.

I mean if I  tell the truth all the time if I just let everybody up but then you know we're afraid and that's  why we lie. That's why I have always lied. When I lie I lie because I'm afraid. But on another hand you have pride. You know smart Luther said that the Christians are like a drunk  man who having fallen off of the horse on the one side promptly gets up on the horse and falls  off on the other.

And so we are now stuck between I would cook I would have to say two cultures. Listen to me. On the one hand we really do have a problem. We have a culture that is  relativistic. It really is.

They do say who's to say what is truth. Nobody can say what is right  wrong. All truth and morality is culturally relative. Now one of the bad problems we have there  and it's almost a joke is then we get real upset. We tell kids there is no right or wrong.

You have  to decide yourself. There is no such thing as truth and then we get all upset when they get out  into society and they lie and they cheat. C.S. Lewis in his abolition of man puts it like this. We clamor for the very qualities we are rendering impossible.

We laugh at honor. You know we laugh  at the idea of honor and truth. We laugh at honor and are shocked to find traders in our midst. We castrate and bid the gildings be fruitful. And he's what he's saying there.

He says we tell kids  all truth and morality is culturally relative. Who's to say what is truth and then it says we clamor  for the very qualities we are rendering impossible. Look at all this corruption. Look at all these people  cheating. Look at all these people not being honest.

Truth is relative but why aren't you honest? We clamor for the very qualities we are rendering impossible. We laugh at honor and are shocked  to find traders in our midst. We castrate them and then we build the gildings be fruitful and develop  virtue and honesty and integrity and they can't. And so on the one hand we are living in a society  like that but therefore the danger is to react and become people who use unwholesome words.

People who use the truth not to build up and not to benefit. You know we attack not the problem  but the person when we use the truth. So we have the truth party. We have the truth and nobody  else. And we have the love party.

Ah this just accept everybody but here's the problem. Truth  without love is not really truth. It is a power grab and love without truth is not really love. It's  cowardice or intellectual laziness. Truth and love have to be together or they're not themselves.

Got that? That's what Paul is saying here. Love without truth isn't truth and truth without love. Truth that love isn't truth and love without truth isn't love. Unless they're together they're not  themselves.

So what are we going to do? Here's what we're going to do. In John chapter 18 I just  noticed this this week there's really two trials. Jesus first is dragged before the high priest  before they you know before his crucifixion he's dragged before the high priest and they  religious leaders and then the same chapters drag before pilot. Now when he's dragged before  the high priest you know what he says?

High testified to the truth and they smack him. But then when he gets in front of pilot he uses almost exactly the same words I testified to the truth. And you know what pilot says? What is truth? And then they kill him.

I want you to behold the  wonder of this. First of all I want you to behold the wonder of the integrity of Jesus. Jesus  Christ, what a man of integrity. Why? He's the same both places.

There's no pseudo about Jesus. He's the same in one place as another. Here's the moralists, right? The people that he has  the religious leaders that he has been denouncing as moralists. Here's the moralists.

He says the  same thing. Here's the relativists. What is truth says pilot and he's exactly the same. He's not  two different kinds of people and notice this. He's not only the same in both places but they both  hate him.

They both smack him. They both kill him. Why? Because here's what's so weird. The  relativists and the moralists both are about power.

The reason the relativists says who's to say  what truth is is to get power. The reason why the moralist says I have the truth is about power. But Jesus Christ is the exact opposite. He is standing on his integrity, absolute integrity. I  testify the truth.

He says the same and it gets him killed. Why? Because he's using the truth to  serve us. They're using the truth to get power over us. His integrity took him to the cross.

But why did he want to go to the cross? And here is the solution. May I ask you a question? Did Jesus Christ go to the cross for truth? Was that why he went?

To show that God's law cannot be broken. To show that God's holiness and  his righteousness has to be satisfied. Did Jesus Christ go to the cross for the sake of the truth? Or did Jesus Christ go to the cross for the sake of love so that we could be pardoned so we could  be forgiven in spite of our sins? So we could be embraced so we could be accepted.

Okay everybody. Did Jesus Christ go to the cross for truth or did Jesus Christ go to the cross for  love? And the answer is yes. The minute he died, the truth of God was infinitely satisfied because  he fulfilled all the requirements of the love God. But the minute Jesus died, the love of God  was infinitely satisfied because now he can embrace us and pardon us and forgive us and receive us  in spite of our sins.

The cross brought truth and love together. I know in the world and sometimes  in our lives it seems like they're at loggerheads. But if I tell the truth, I don't know if that's  loving or if I really, in other words they seem at loggerheads but on the cross they were not at  loggerheads and when the cross comes into the center of your life they won't be either. You know why? It keeps you from the fear that makes you a person who plays fast and loses the truth because  Jesus Christ loved you so much that he died for you, but it also keeps you from the pride that makes  you a person who might abuse with the truth because Jesus Christ had to die for you.

You're that  sinful. So the pride that leads you to abuse people with the truth is taken away by the cross. The fear that leads us to duck and dive and play with the truth is taken away. Our hearts are so  filled with love that here's what we can do. Verse 29, I know that the translation says you should  only do what will benefit those who listen but literally the Greek says you should only say that  which will give grace to those who listen.

When you get the grace from the cross of Jesus Christ  then you can speak the truth graciously and only then or you could put it one other way. Yeah,  as Mr. Incredible once said, I got time. We can do one, let me tell you one more thing. In the beginning, don't think about that too much.

In the beginning of history, it was a disaster. Adam and Eve, you know, Garden of Eden, what happens? Sin, serpent, you know the story. Everything's horrible, death, destruction, evil, everything's horrible except there's a glimmer of  hope. You know what it is?

It's a promise. Genesis 3, 15, God says, I promise that one descendant of  Eve is someday going to bruise the head of the serpent, destroy evil. I promise. Scroll forward  centuries later. God starts talking to Abram says, I'm going to say the world through your descendants  and one night Abram says, but how can I be sure?

And in Genesis 15, God shocks Abraham and he  shocks anybody who understands what he's doing in Genesis 15 when he appears and he passes between  the pieces of a dead animal and he says, I will save the world through one of your descendants  even if it means I have to die. A second promise. And then years later, Jesus Christ comes into  the world and he's a man of complete integrity, complete integrity. He always means what he says,  always says what he means, absolute integrity, but at the very end in the ultimate act of integrity,  he sets his face like a flint to go to Jerusalem and he goes to the cross, why? He's fulfilling his  promise.

He's fulfilling the promise of God. And everything's before him. Everything comes down. Everything opposes him. Hell itself comes down and he says, no, I've made a promise and he  goes to the cross and he dies for us.

You've been saved by the integrity of Jesus. You've been  saved by the promise keeping of Jesus Christ. That should humble us away from ever using truth  against people, but on the other hand, it convinces us there is a truth where we can't be  at all. And it destroys our fear of telling the truth and therefore, oh, friends, look at the  integrity of Jesus, look at what he did for you on the cross and become people of integrity. Let's pray.

Thank you, Father, for giving us this vision of Jesus Christ who kept all his promises. He was a man of integrity. He used the truth to save us, not to exploit us. Our Father, when we deny the truth or fail to speak the truth, to save our next,  or when we abuse people with the truth, to get the power and status we want, we are just  turning our eyes away from your Son. Who was the way the truth and the life,  but who on the cross gave us forever a vision of how truth and love are joined together.

They're one flesh, never to be parted, and we pray that the vision of what Jesus did on the cross  would enable the truth and love to grow in our own lives, go hand in hand. We pray you make us a  community of integrity. We pray that you'd help us to know how to speak the truth in our culture  right now that doesn't want to hear it. We pray, Lord, that you would help us to know what it  needs to be, people of integrity. We ask this in Jesus' name, amen.

### 中文翻译

### 引言：诚信的困境

当马克·吐温还是个男孩时，有一天他走在街上，看到一辆装满西瓜的车。他喜欢西瓜，于是悄悄靠近，偷了一个，跑到小巷里咬了一口。然而刚咬下去，一种奇怪的感觉涌上心头。他毫不犹豫地走回车边，放回了那个西瓜——然后**偷了一个熟的**。

这个故事讲起来容易接受，比起偷情或偷钱，偷西瓜似乎无伤大雅。但这恰恰说明了问题：我们对诚信的标准有多低，我们多容易让一些"小谎言"轻易滑过。

### 第一部分：诚信的反面是不诚实

诗篇15篇描述了一个正直的人：说真话、行公义、不受贿、即使吃亏也守约。

#### 1. 不要撒谎

耶稣在登山宝训中说："你们不可起誓……你们的话，是，就说是；不是，就说不是。"

什么意思？有些人认为只有在起誓时才必须说实话，平时可以打折扣。耶稣说：**不存在"真话的等级"**。你说的每一句"是"或"不是"，在神看来都是誓言。

马太福音12章说，我们要为每一句闲话交账。

想象一下，如果明天你的每句话都被录像，然后通过卫星向二十亿人播放，这会影响你明天说话的方式吗？当然会。但耶稣告诉我们：**你的实际处境比这更严重**，因为神在看着，祂的审判比二十亿人的意见重要得多。

#### 2. 不要违约

第4节说："他发了誓，虽然自己吃亏，也不更改。"

**什么是承诺？** 切斯特顿说，承诺是你与未来的自己定的约会。

当你承诺"我会爱你"，你是在说："我拒绝被我的基因、脑化学、社会或历史推来推去。无论发生什么，五年后我都会在那里。"

承诺带来自由，违约带来奴役。

托马斯·莫尔快要被烧死时，他的女儿恳求他收回承诺保命。莫尔说："梅格，当一个人起誓时，他把自己握在手中，就像握着水一样。如果他张开手指，就不要指望再找回自己了。"

### 第二部分：诚信的赝品是虚伪

诗篇15篇第2节不只说这人"说真话"，而是说他"**从心里说真话**"。

"诚信"（integrity）这个词和"整数"（integer）是同一个词根。整数是完整的数，不是分数。一个有诚信的人是**表里如一**的人。

虚伪（hypocrisy）在希腊语中是"演员"的意思。虚伪的人就是在演戏——外表一套，内心另一套。

我在南方牧会时，走进一个房间，人们在说："你知道是什么让这个国家伟大吗？工会！没有工会我们还在种稻子呢！"然后走进另一个房间，人们在说："你知道是什么在毁掉这个国家吗？工会！"

他们都问我："牧师，你说是不是？"我怎么回答的？我说："嗯，有道理……"

你看，我不是一个有诚信的人。

### 第三部分：如何培养诚信

诗篇15篇末尾说："行这些事的人，必永不动摇。"  
诗篇16篇中间说："我将耶和华常摆在我面前……我便不致动摇。"

**要过完全诚信的生活，必须将神常摆在你面前。**

#### 1. 认识到你需要神

谎言从哪里开始？从伊甸园开始。当亚当夏娃决定自己做主，不再完全依靠神，他们就与现实脱节了，**不得不开始躲藏**。这就是一切不诚实的根源。

为什么你那么难承认自己错了？  
为什么你总是要说服自己是某个人物？  
为什么你那么难听取批评？  
为什么你总是把问题怪到别人头上？

所有这些不诚实，都来自于**不愿承认我们需要神，不愿承认我们完全依靠祂**。

耶稣讲过一个比喻：两个儿子被叫去干活，一个说"我去"却没去，另一个说"我不去"却在最后时刻改变主意去了。哪个是顺服的？

法利赛人说是第二个。耶稣说："所以我告诉你们，税吏和娼妓倒比你们先进神的国。"

为什么？因为法利赛人不愿承认自己的软弱和罪。而**承认自己的不诚实，是诚实的开始**。

#### 2. 在耶稣里找到神

耶稣对彼拉多说："我就是真理。凡属真理的人就听我的话。"

知道真理是一回事，拥有真理是一回事，努力行真理是一回事——但**怎样才能让真理流淌在你的血管里**？

只有当你爱耶稣基督，祂的生命进入你、渗透你，只有当你活得好像神时刻在你面前，你才能过诚信的生活。

当你向祂敞开心扉，祂就向你敞开心扉，然后你才能向别人敞开心扉。只有那时，你才能过完全诚信的生活。

### 结语

你知道那意味着什么吗？  
意味着真诚到如此地步，简单到如此地步，你的心像一潭清澈的湖水，别人可以看到底。  
意味着你是一个有点严肃但又非常平易近人的人。  
人们可能会因为你的诚实而有点怕你，但他们会想和你打交道，因为他们知道你说话算话，因为他们知道你基本上是有爱心、公平的。

你是这样的人吗？

去找祂。向祂敞开心扉。将祂常摆在你面前，你就必永不动摇。

## Chinese Transcript / 中文

今天,提姆·凯勒探讨圣灵的果子之一。今天的读经选自以弗所书第4章第14和15节,第20至25节,以及第29节。这样,我们就不再是婴孩,被波浪摇来摇去,被各种教训之风吹动,受人的欺骗和诡计所迷惑。相反,我们要用爱心说诚实话,在各方面长进,达到基督——那头的身量。然而,你们认识基督,却不是这样。

你们确实听过他的事,也在他里面受过教导,按照在耶稣里的真理。你们学到的是,要脱去你们从前行为上的旧人,这旧人因私欲的迷惑而渐渐败坏;又要在心思意念上更新,并且穿上新人,这新人是照着神的形象造的,有真理的公义和圣洁。所以,你们各人要弃绝谎言,与邻舍说诚实话,因为我们是互相为肢体的。不可让污秽的话从你们口中出来,只要说造就人的好话,合乎需要,使听见的人得益处。这是主的话语。

加拉太书5章22至23节列出了所谓的圣灵的果子。这些是特征,是超自然改变的心的描述:仁爱、喜乐、和平、忍耐。我们每周看一个,这样也许我们自己的生命中可以有更多超自然的改变。今天我们来到信实。信实这个词就是诚实、正直、真实,我们将要查考的这段经文非常好,可以让我们更深入地了解它的含义。没有比这更贴切的主题了。

由于经济危机、衰退,以及从那时起披露的种种事情,我们的信任——美国人对他们机构的信任:商业、政府、教会,处于历史最低点,所有研究都表明这一点,因为人们感觉到我们社会各个层面都存在诚信的失败。那么,圣经对这个非常相关、极其重要的主题有什么要说的呢?这段经文将向我们展示,关于真理有两个问题。一个是实践真实的问题,另一个是用真理伤害人的问题。所以有实践真理的问题,然后有用真理伤害人的问题,然后我们将看到解决方案是什么,我们如何解决这两个问题。

好吗?首先,首先是实践真理的问题。根据圣经,这是一件非常有要求的事情,这段经文的好处在于,它提到了成为诚实的人的三个非常重要的方面。成为诚实意味着什么?首先,它意味着拒绝欺骗人,不欺骗人。

注意第14和15节,第15节说,相反要说真话,相反什么呢?在第14节中说,狡猾、诡计和欺骗。现在,这是极其重要的,因为如果你我倾向于严格地把说谎看作传达不准确的陈述。但圣经很早就理解了今天所谓的言语行为理论。你知道什么是言语行为理论吗?

言语行为理论是一种洞见,即每一个词实际上也是一个行为。我们倾向于说言语和行为是两回事,但每个词实际上都是一个行为。也就是说,每个词不仅设计用来传达信息,它还设计用来完成某件事。它有一个意图,它有一个目的。为了评估一个词或一个短语,你不仅需要评估它是否传达了准确的信息,还要评估它的目的是什么。

例如,办公室发生了盗窃案,你的办公室。你知道是A先生做的,但你想保护并掩护A先生。所以调查人员来了。

你不想对他们撒谎,对吧?他们说,是谁干的?你看到了什么?你说,我看到B先生那天晚上在那里。

这是谎言吗?技术上,你说的是实际发生的事情。这是事实。B先生那天晚上确实在那里。

你确实那天晚上看到B先生在那里。但这个陈述的目的是什么?是误导。是隐藏。

是欺骗。你试图让他们追查下去。你知道,你在给他们一个转移注意力的东西。因此,根据圣经,什么是不真实的话?不真实的话就是任何故意试图向听者隐藏现实的话。

每一个向你提问的听者,如果你对他们撒谎,那意味着你故意向他们隐瞒你所知道的现实。因此,如果你在欺骗,无论你所说的在技术上是否真实,那都是谎言。而且是错的。结果,顺便说一句,这确实意味着一旦你意识到圣经在这里说什么,它确实扩展了你的理解。不是吗?

不真实的话?所以有人曾经列出这样一个小清单:礼貌的谎言、委婉语、夸张、词语膨胀,以及所谓的善意谎言。但它们都是谎言。这里有一个礼貌的谎言。我很想去,但我会不在城里。

但你不会不在城里。这是委婉语。我认为你的写作对我们的读者来说太复杂了。当你的意思是对我们的读者来说太糟糕了。但你不想说太糟糕。

你会让他们不高兴。这是委婉语。这是谎言,明白吗?夸张。这在婚姻中很常见。

你总是,你从来没有出去,当然,这不是真的,因为你正在指责的那个人有时做或有时做,但当你说你总是,你从来,实际上言语行为理论在这里,你知道,即使这大致是真的,你在用这话痛打那个人,而且你在夸大其词。所以那个人会找到你说的错误的部分,只会激化事情。你今晚会很晚才睡。或者词语膨胀。这里有件事。

现在想想这个,各位。这是基督徒特别会做的事,但在任何地方都可以做。每当教会的公开讨论都是,这真是祝福。主在那里。太不可思议了。

现在发生的是,有时主确实在那里,有时它确实是祝福,有时它确实不可思议。当它总是祝福时,总是不可思议时。你只是在制造犬儒主义,特别是在你的孩子中间。只是在制造犬儒主义。这是词语膨胀。

所以你实际在做的是,这不是,这是欺骗性的。这只是一种总是,这是炒作。炒作是欺骗性的。炒作不是现实。然后你有一大堆所谓的善意谎言。

有使能谎言,比如当你不断为一个无能的朋友撒谎时,而你实际上应该面对他或她关于他们如何生活的问题。或者你有水门谎言。你知道什么是水门谎言吗?水门谎言就是,好吧,小人物不会理解。对他们来说太复杂了。

所以这就是我要说的。这都是欺骗。过一种真实的生活意味着拒绝欺骗。第一,第二。其次,根据圣经,过一种真实的生活就是许诺并遵守诺言。

这实际上体现出来了,虽然你可能不会立即看到,在第25节。如果你是基督徒,你应该对每个人说真话,当然。但在第25节中,它实际上说,对你的邻舍说诚实话。现在那听起来可能像任何人,但然后它说,因为我们是一个身体的肢体。这里他谈论的是基督徒对基督徒。

那个一个身体的肢体是一个盟约形象。盟约是一个协议。盟约是一个承诺。盟约是你通过签订合同或作出承诺而进入的公开承诺。这里我们被告知基督徒是不害怕的人。

他们许诺并遵守诺言。我们生活在一个非常强调个人自由、保持选择余地的文化中,以至于人们不再在过去常常许诺的地方许诺。如果他们确实许诺,只要涉及任何自我否定,他们就会感到非常自由地打破诺言。让我给你两个例子,我会立即回答。两个人们过去常常许诺但现在不许诺的地方的例子。

一个是未婚同居。其次,非常积极参与教会但不加入。在这两种情况下,你都没有作出你过去作出的承诺。现在马上,有人会说,你是在把这两件事等同起来吗?我没有等同它们。

我不是说它们同样错误或糟糕。我要说的是40年前,这两种情况都不太发生。它们不太发生的原因是,许诺、确定并承诺自己,在某种意义上,承诺自己并关闭你的选择,不被认为是今天那么可怕的事情,但现在是。所以它渗透到我们所有人身上。问题之一是我们实际上认为,原因之一是我们非常重视我们的自由,以至于我们觉得如果我许诺,如果我作出承诺并坚持它们,那不知怎的我就失去了自由,但这根本不是真的。

刘易斯·米德在他的伟大著作《道德承诺》中,这是对十诫的阐释,在一处谈到这个。他谈论许诺、遵守承诺和立誓。当他谈论它时,你可以听出来,他在某种程度上想到的是婚姻誓言,但他在这段引文中所说的实际上对所有承诺和所有承诺都是真实的。他这样说:当我们许诺时,我们承担起与他人一起创造未来的责任,无论命运或天数有什么安排。这几乎是终极的自由。

当我许诺时,我见证我与你的未来不是由从我家庭基因库中发给我的牌决定的。当我许诺时,我证明我没有沿着某条不可改变的路线前进,这条路线是由我那有点古怪的父母对我施加的心理调节决定的。我不是被注定的,我不是被决定的,我不是一团人类面团,被我过去的偶然强化和调节的厌恶塑造成形。现在我和下一个人一样清楚,我是什么和我做什么在很大程度上是来自我过去的礼物或诅咒,但当我向任何人许诺时,我超越了所有限制我的调节,没有德国牧羊犬曾经承诺与我在一起,没有计算机曾经承诺终身忠诚,只有人才能许诺,当他这样做时,他是最自由的。你看,当你说,但如果我许这个诺,如果我作这个承诺,如果我承诺在那里,那我就不会有自由,他说的是相反的,你不明白如果你不许诺,那么你就是环境的奴隶,你是感觉的奴隶,你是恐惧的奴隶,你是冲动的奴隶,许个诺。

这是你说的方式,这就是我将要成为的方式,我不在乎其他任何事情发生,这让你更自由。成为有正直的人,我们应该是不害怕许诺和遵守诺言的人。所以拒绝欺骗,许诺遵守诺言,以及实践真理和诚实意味着什么的第三个方面是多个自我的正直,多个自我的正直。看第25节,它说,所以你们各人要弃绝谎言。但你知道原文希腊文说的是什么吗,你必须弃绝伪装。

那是希腊词,伪装。这就是他在说的。想想正直这个词。在英语中,它与整数这个词相同。什么是整数?

它是一个整数,不是分数,不能被分割的东西。它是一个整数。什么是正直?有正直的人在每个地方都有相同的自我。你没有一个伪装的自我和一个真实的自我。

例如,缺乏正直的人私下是一种方式,公开是另一种方式。这就是为什么政客应该真的小心那些现场麦克风。你私下是一种方式,公开是另一种方式。没有正直,你和这个群体在一起是一种方式,和那个群体在一起是完全不同的方式。你说的话与你说你相信的完全不同,这完全不同。

然而,有正直的人,私下和公开是一样的。与这个群体和那个群体一样。你想的和你说的一样,你说的和你做的一样。你没有多个自我,一个真实的自我和一堆伪装的自我。你有一个自我,一个真实的自我。

天哪,这是缺乏的。如果我有时间,我会谈论所有文化原因,为什么我们实际上被文化鼓励创造完全不同的自我。你认为呢?你认为所有那些互联网名字是什么?你创造完全不同的自我。

我们被鼓励这样做。但让我给你一个例子,说明它在一个领域有多毁灭性,这是我在开头提到的,那就是商业。几年前,一个正在写一本关于如何作为商业领袖拥有正直的书的人只是写了这些东西。现在,我只是把它们拿出来,因为它们很常见,但它们也很有启发性。他说,不要公开说我们追求质量,但私下你有不合理的截止日期,你所有的员工都知道。

不要在公司包厢招待朋友,当每个人都知道你应该只带客户去那里时。不要公开说一切都好,当你所有的员工都知道一切都不好时。不要给管理层巨大的津贴而不给其他人。不要在季度结束前投入大量订单,因为即使你知道它们都会被取消,在季度数字中看起来会很好。当你听到这类事情时,你突然意识到,哦,我的天哪,我们就是游在这个里面。

我回到这个例子。不要让鱼告诉你关于水的事,因为那时鱼会说,好吧,什么是水?因为鱼在水里,鱼甚至看不到地球的水。也许我们正在到达这样一个地方,我们甚至不能对商业、政府、教会、现实生活中的人说,只要做有正直的人,因为他们甚至不知道那是什么,因为他们太习惯于这个人说的那种行为,不要做,不要做,但我们就是游在其中。到处都是。在整个这段经文中,我们应该诚实的原因回到上帝。不是吗?我们应该公义、诚实和圣洁,因为上帝是诚实、公义和圣洁的。如果你是基督徒信徒,这个含义是惊人的。在登山宝训中有一个地方。

当你通读登山宝训时,很多东西都有道理。当你到达这个地方时,它似乎没有道理。是关于誓言的。有一个地方耶稣说,不要指着耶路撒冷城起誓,不要指着你的头起誓,但要让你的是就是是,不就是不。你说,什么?

这就是他的意思。在那些日子里,人们理解或相信,如果你指着上帝的名起誓,那么你永远不能违背你的誓言。这可能与他们对十诫的理解有关,十诫说,你不可妄称耶和华你上帝的名,这意味着你决不能援引上帝的名然后不遵守。如果你援引上帝的名,那么你最好遵守。但他们说,如果你指着别的东西起誓,如果你指着你父亲的坟墓起誓,或者如果你指着耶路撒冷城起誓,或者如果你指着你自己的头起誓,那就不同了。

如果你像那样许诺,违背它也没那么糟糕。你知道耶稣在说什么吗,你不敢相信那个。他说,你不明白吗?耶路撒冷是上帝的城。你的头是上帝的,上帝造了你的头。

你父亲的坟墓是上帝的。他说,你不明白每一个是和每一个不是,你每天说的每一件事,每一句闲话都是在起誓,就像你在起誓一样,因为你站在大君王的宝座前。绝对地,没有不同程度的真实。绝对地,你说的每一件事实际上都是在起誓。如果我告诉你明天有人会跟着你,会录像,你做的每一件事和你说的每一件话,你会更有正直地说话吗?

你会更小心吗?你如何对你的配偶或你的朋友或你正在向其推销交易的人,潜在客户,说话,你会更小心一点吗?如果你知道它正在被录制,然后明天它会被放到互联网上,你会更小心吗?我会的,你也会。如果我们是基督徒,我们就是傻瓜。

因为我们会更小心是真的。然而耶稣基督说,你不明白你正在接受比那更大的审视吗?你的每一句话都被比几千人在互联网上观看更大的问责所持有。上帝,真理的上帝,公义的上帝,圣洁的上帝,你就站在他面前。诗篇可以深刻地塑造你接近上帝的方式。

即使耶稣也依赖诗篇来面对每一种情况,包括死亡。在提姆和凯西·凯勒的365天灵修《耶稣的诗歌》中,你会找到每日通过诗篇的阅读以及新鲜的圣经洞见。如果你没有定期的灵修实践,这本书是一个很好的开始方式。如果你已经花时间研究和祷告,那么阅读和通过诗篇祷告可以帮助你把你最深的情感和问题带到上帝面前,并发现与他的新层次的亲密。我们会寄给你提姆和凯西·凯勒的灵修书,作为你帮助福音与生活与更多人分享耶稣的爱的礼物的感谢。

今天就在gospelandlife.com/give请求你的副本。那就是gospelandlife.com/give。所以你看到了实践真理的问题和困难,但这不是保罗在这里提出的关于真理的唯一问题。关于真理这不是唯一的问题。有第二个问题,对我来说很有趣。

他在第15节中暗示了它。当他不只是说,相反要说真话。他不只是说说真话。他说用爱心说真话。不只是说说真话。

他说用爱心。好吧,那很好。当你看那个时,你会想,好吧,所以要诚实但加上爱。所以真理是一回事,爱是另一回事。但当你到达第29节,最后一节时,你会看到保罗提出的多么了不起的观点,因为他说,不可让污秽的话从你口中出来。

那个污秽这个词字面意思是腐烂的。这是一个意味着腐败的词。这是一个意味着导致衰败和瓦解的词。好的。那么什么是污秽的话?

污秽的话是任何不是设计用来造就、不是设计用来使人得益处的东西。你说,那是什么意思?不是设计用来造就和使人得益处的真话。即使是真话也是腐烂的。答案是肯定的,这就是保罗所说的。

腐烂的。那么什么是污秽的话?这是什么意思?好吧,一方面,你知道,我仍然总是,我总是对亨利五世剧中的一个地方感到惊讶,莎士比亚的戏剧亨利五世,当他刚刚因为,你知道,他,他们正在入侵法国,英国人正在入侵法国,我想他因为掠夺而绞死了一个人。在某一时刻,他转身对他所有的士兵说,他说,我不会让法国人被贬低或在轻蔑的语言中被辱骂。

好的。是的,我们是来征服他们的,但我们不会。我们不会轻蔑地说话。我们不会辱骂他们。现在这显然就是它的意思,但我相信保罗不只是在谈论辱骂性的,你知道,愤怒的刺耳语气,尽管他肯定是在说那个。

如果你用辱骂性的、刺耳的、愤怒的方式说真话,那是腐烂的,那是恶臭的,那是错误的,那是有罪的。我在说真话,这无关紧要,原因如下。当你用辱骂性的方式说真话时,当你用真理痛打人时,你真的关心真理吗?你真的是真理的勇士吗?不,你是为自己勇猛。

但保罗不仅在谈论,我认为,公然辱骂性的话。他在说任何实际上不是设计用来使人得益处和造就的东西。这太惊人了。当你对某人说真话时,你的目标是什么?这里我们又回到言语行为理论。

好的,也许你所说的在技术上是真的,教义上是真的,你知道,准确的,但你是在试图边缘化那个人在其他人眼中的地位吗?你是在试图痛打那个人吗?你是在试图惩罚他们吗?你是在试图让他们知道自己的地位吗?你是在试图因为你对他们如此严厉而从其他人那里得到掌声吗?

保罗说这些都不对。任何基本上用真理来痛打人以便为自己获得更多权力和地位的人都是在滥用真理。你不是真理的勇士,你是为自己勇猛。你在利用真理为自己获得权力和地位。顺便说一下,在这一点上,你意识到我们来到了一个地方,我们来到了今天外面的世界,特别是在我们的文化中,对教会的主要反对意见之一。

福柯、尼采,那些人,多年来一直在说,当基督徒声称拥有真理时,他们实际上基本上只是在利用真理来占上风。所以福柯在一个著名的地方说,法国哲学家福柯说,真理是这个世界的东西。它是由多种形式的约束产生的,它会产生规律的权力效应。每个社会都有其真理制度。他说基本上真理声明是权力游戏。

现在当基督徒听到这个时应该做什么?我会根据圣经告诉你他们应该做什么。他们应该做的第一件事不是备份并说,等一下,真的有绝对真理。他们应该悔改。原因如下。

早在福柯之前,早在尼采之前,早在马克思之前,耶稣说了这个,他说,你们法利赛人有祸了,因为你们喜欢会堂里的首位和市场上的问安。你们有祸了,因为你们把难担的重担放在人身上,自己却一个指头也不动来帮助他们。他在说什么?他在谈论利用上帝的律法、真理、圣经来获得社会中的地位、正确的地位、高地位,并让人们处于低位的人。这正是福柯和尼采所说的。

是的。看,耶稣基督多年前就用福音来拆解保罗所谈论的以及世界上许多不喜欢基督教的人所抱怨的东西。如果你从上帝的白白恩典中获得你的价值感和价值,如果你知道你值什么的原因只是上帝的白白的爱和恩典。那么上帝的真理只是成为取悦他的一种方式。这是你爱的东西。

所以如果你从上帝的恩典中获得你的价值感,你就爱真理。但如果你从正确中获得你的价值感和价值,如果你从拥有真理、准确和成为真理的勇士而不是从上帝那里获得你的价值感和价值,你说你指望真理给你只有上帝才能给你的东西。一种你一定是一个有价值的重要人物的感觉,因为你如此了解真理等等。看,耶稣多年前就称那为道德主义、法利赛主义,并拆解了它。因此基督徒在某种程度上站在一块非常狭窄的地面上。

事实上,对大多数道路来说是看不见的,因为在这边你有基本上说谁能说什么是真理的人?什么是真理?你知道每个人都必须为他或她自己决定什么是真理。他们要么否认存在真理的事实,要么对真理草率行事。而在另一边,你有说是的有真理,这是绝对真理的人,他们用它来痛打人,耶稣说保罗说这两者都是腐烂的。

如果你是一个有正直的人,你不会做任何一个。一个用真理痛打人的人并不真正有效于真理,你有效于你自己。你知道外面的非基督徒思想家看到它并知道它。所以有两个问题。你知道一方面我们害怕,我们害怕诚实。

你知道一直说真话有什么困难吗。你知道遵守诺言和许诺有什么困难吗。你知道正直有什么困难吗。这很可怕。你知道这很可怕。

我的意思是,如果我一直说真话,如果我只是让每个人都知道,但你知道我们害怕,这就是我们撒谎的原因。这就是我一直撒谎的原因。当我撒谎时,我是因为害怕而撒谎。但另一方面你有骄傲。你知道聪明的路德说,基督徒就像一个醉汉,从马的一边摔下来,迅速爬上马,然后从另一边摔下来。

所以我们现在被困在我会烹饪我不得不说两种文化之间。听我说。一方面我们确实有一个问题。我们有一个相对主义的文化。确实如此。

他们确实说谁能说什么是真理。没有人能说什么是对错。所有真理和道德都是文化相对的。现在我们在那里有一个糟糕的问题,这几乎是个笑话,那就是然后我们变得非常沮丧。我们告诉孩子没有对错。

你必须自己决定。没有所谓的真理,然后当他们进入社会撒谎和欺骗时我们都很沮丧。C.S.路易斯在他的《人之废除》中这样说。我们呼求我们正在使之不可能的品质。你知道我们嘲笑荣誉。你知道我们嘲笑荣誉和真理的观念。我们嘲笑荣誉,却震惊于在我们中间发现叛徒。我们阉割然后命令阉割的马生育。他在那里说的是什么。

他说我们告诉孩子所有真理和道德都是文化相对的。谁能说什么是真理,然后它说我们呼求我们正在使之不可能的品质。看看所有这些腐败。看看所有这些欺骗的人。看看所有这些不诚实的人。

真理是相对的,但你为什么不诚实?我们呼求我们正在使之不可能的品质。我们嘲笑荣誉,却震惊于在我们中间发现叛徒。我们阉割他们,然后我们命令阉割的马生育并发展美德和诚实和正直,他们不能。所以一方面我们生活在这样一个社会中,但因此危险在于反应并成为使用污秽话语的人。

使用真理不是为了造就和不是为了使人得益处的人。你知道当我们使用真理时,我们攻击的不是问题而是人。所以我们有真理党。我们有真理,没有别人有。我们有爱党。

啊,这只是接受每个人,但这里有问题。没有爱的真理不是真正的真理。它是一种权力攫取,没有真理的爱不是真正的爱。这是懦弱或智力懒惰。真理和爱必须在一起,否则它们不是它们自己。

明白了吗?这就是保罗在这里说的。没有真理的爱不是真理,没有爱的真理。没有爱的真理不是真理,没有真理的爱不是爱。除非它们在一起,否则它们不是它们自己。

那么我们要做什么?这就是我们要做的。在约翰福音第18章,我这周才注意到这个,真的有两次审判。耶稣首先被拖到大祭司面前,在他们你知道在他被钉十字架之前,他被拖到大祭司和宗教领袖面前,然后同一章被拖到彼拉多面前。现在当他被拖到大祭司面前时,你知道他说什么吗?

大祭司为真理作证,他们打他。但后来当他到彼拉多面前时,他使用几乎完全相同的话,我为真理作证。你知道彼拉多说什么吗?什么是真理?然后他们杀了他。

我要你看这个奇迹。首先我要你看耶稣的正直的奇迹。耶稣基督,多么有正直的人。为什么?他在两个地方都是一样的。耶稣没有伪装。他在一个地方和另一个地方是一样的。这是道德主义者,对吧?他一直在谴责为道德主义者的宗教领袖。这是道德主义者。

他说同样的话。这是相对主义者。什么是真理,彼拉多说,他完全一样。他不是两种不同的人,注意这个。他不仅在两个地方都一样,而且他们都恨他。他们都打他。他们都杀他。为什么?因为这太奇怪了。相对主义者和道德主义者都是关于权力的。

相对主义者说谁能说什么是真理是为了得到权力。道德主义者说我有真理是关于权力的。但耶稣基督恰恰相反。他站在他的正直上,绝对的正直。我为真理作证。

他说同样的话,这让他被杀。为什么?因为他在用真理服务我们。他们在用真理获得控制我们的权力。他的正直带他到十字架。

但他为什么要去十字架?这就是解决方案。我可以问你一个问题吗?耶稣基督是为了真理而去十字架的吗?那是他去的原因吗?

为了表明上帝的律法不能被打破。为了表明上帝的圣洁和他的公义必须被满足。耶稣基督是为了真理的缘故去十字架的吗?还是耶稣基督是为了爱的缘故去十字架,以便我们可以被赦免,尽管我们有罪,我们可以被原谅。所以我们可以被拥抱,所以我们可以被接纳。

好的,各位。耶稣基督是为真理去十字架还是为爱去十字架?答案是肯定的。他死的那一刻,上帝的真理得到了无限的满足,因为他满足了爱上帝的所有要求。但耶稣死的那一刻,上帝的爱得到了无限的满足,因为现在他可以拥抱我们,赦免我们,原谅我们,尽管我们有罪,接纳我们。

十字架把真理和爱结合在一起。我知道在世界上,有时在我们的生活中,它们似乎是对立的。但如果我说真话,我不知道那是否有爱,或者如果我真的,换句话说,它们似乎对立,但在十字架上它们不对立,当十字架进入你生命的中心时,它们也不会对立。你知道为什么吗?它使你远离使你成为对真理草率行事的人的恐惧,因为耶稣基督如此爱你以至于他为你而死,但它也使你远离可能使你用真理虐待人的骄傲,因为耶稣基督必须为你而死。你就是那么有罪。

所以导致你用真理虐待人的骄傲被十字架除去。导致我们逃避和回避真理的恐惧被除去。我们的心充满了爱,以至于这就是我们可以做的。第29节,我知道翻译说你应该只做对听的人有益的事,但字面上希腊文说你应该只说那些会给听的人恩典的话。

当你从耶稣基督的十字架得到恩典时,那么你可以优雅地说真话,只有那时,或者你可以用另一种方式表达。是的,正如超人总动员先生曾经说的,我有时间。我们可以做一个,让我再告诉你一件事。在起初,不要想太多。在历史的开端,那是一场灾难。亚当和夏娃,你知道,伊甸园,发生了什么?罪,蛇,你知道这个故事。一切都可怕,死亡,毁灭,邪恶,一切都可怕,除了有一线希望。你知道它是什么吗?

这是一个承诺。创世记3章15节,上帝说,我承诺夏娃的一个后裔将来某一天会打伤蛇的头,毁灭邪恶。我承诺。向前滚动几个世纪后。上帝开始对亚伯兰说话,说,我要通过你的后裔拯救世界,一天晚上亚伯兰说,但我怎么能确定?

在创世记15章中,上帝震惊了亚伯拉罕,他震惊了任何理解他在创世记15章中所做的事的人,当他显现并穿过死动物的碎块之间时,他说,我将通过你的一个后裔拯救世界,即使这意味着我必须死。第二个承诺。然后多年后,耶稣基督来到世上,他是一个完全正直的人,完全正直。他总是言出必行,总是说他的意思,绝对正直,但在最后,在正直的终极行动中,他定意面向耶路撒冷,他去十字架,为什么?他在履行他的承诺。

他在履行上帝的承诺。一切都在他面前。一切都归结于此。一切都反对他。地狱本身降临,他说,不,我许了诺,他去十字架,为我们而死。

你已被耶稣的正直所拯救。你已被耶稣基督的守诺所拯救。这应该使我们谦卑,远离用真理对付人,但另一方面,它使我们确信有一个真理,我们根本不能。它摧毁了我们说真话的恐惧,因此,哦,朋友们,看看耶稣的正直,看看他在十字架上为你所做的,成为有正直的人。让我们祷告。

感谢天父,给我们这个耶稣基督的异象,他遵守了他所有的诺言。他是一个有正直的人。他用真理拯救我们,而不是利用我们。我们的父,当我们否认真理或未能说真话,以拯救我们的脖子,或当我们用真理虐待人,以获得我们想要的权力和地位时,我们只是把我们的眼睛从你的儿子身上移开。他是道路、真理和生命,但他在十字架上永远给了我们一个真理和爱如何结合在一起的异象。

它们是一体的,永不分离,我们祈祷,耶稣在十字架上所做的异象将使真理和爱在我们自己的生命中成长,携手并进。我们祈祷你使我们成为一个有正直的社区。我们祈祷你帮助我们知道如何在我们现在不想听它的文化中说真话。我们祈祷,主啊,你帮助我们知道成为有正直的人需要什么。我们奉耶稣的名祈求,阿们。

今天，提姆·凯勒将探讨圣灵的果子之一。今天的经文选自以弗所书第四章第14和15节，第20至25节以及第29节。如此，我们不再作小孩子，中了人的诡计和欺骗的法术，被一切异教之风摇动，飘来飘去，就随从各样的异端。惟用爱心说诚实话，凡事长进，连于元首基督。然而，你们学了基督，却不是这样。

你们听过他的道，领了他的教，学了他的真理。就要脱去你们从前行为上的旧人，这旧人是因私欲的迷惑渐渐变坏的，又要将你们的心志改换一新，并且穿上新人，这新人是照着神的形象造的，有真理的仁义和圣洁。所以，你们要弃绝谎言，各人与邻舍说实话，因为我们是互相为肢体。污秽的言语一句不可出口，只要随事说造就人的好话，叫听见的人得益处。这是主的道。

加拉太书第五章第22至23节列出了所谓的圣灵的果子。这些是超自然改变之心的特征和描述——爱、喜乐、和平、忍耐，我们每周探讨其中一个，以便我们能够在自己的生命中有更多超自然的改变。今天我们来到忠信。忠信这个词意味着诚实、正直、真实，这是一段很好的经文，我们将要深入探讨它的含义。没有比这更相关的主题了。

由于经济危机、经济衰退以及此后披露的种种问题，美国人对他们机构——企业、政府、教会——的信任降到了历史最低点，所有研究都表明了这一点，因为人们感到我们的社会在各个层面都出现了诚信的失败。那么，对于这个因此非常相关且至关重要的主题，圣经是怎么说的呢？这段特别的经文

将向我们展示，关于真理有两个问题。一个是践行真实的问题，另一个则是用真理去伤害他人的问题。所以既有践行真理的问题，也有用真理伤害他人的问题，然后我们将看到解决方案是什么，我们如何解决这两个问题。

好吗？首先，首先是践行真理的问题。根据圣经，这是一件非常艰巨的事情，而这段经文的精妙之处在于，它提到了成为真实的人的三个非常重要的方面。成为真实意味着什么？首先，这意味着拒绝欺骗他人，不欺骗他人。

请注意第14和15节，第15节说，要说真话，而不是什么呢？在第14节中说到，狡猾、诡计和欺骗。现在，这是极其重要的，因为你我往往倾向于将说谎严格地理解为传达不准确的陈述。但圣经很早就理解了今天所谓的言语行为理论。你知道什么是言语行为理论吗？

言语行为理论的洞见是，每一个词实际上也是一个行为。我们倾向于说词语和行为是两回事，但每一个词实际上都是一个行为。也就是说，每一个词不仅仅是设计来传达信息的，它也是设计来完成某件事的。它有意图，有目的。为了评估一个词或一个短语，你不仅需要评估它是否传达了准确的信息，还需要评估它的目的是什么。

举个例子，办公室里发生了盗窃案，你的办公室。你知道是A先生做的，但你想保护和掩护A先生。所以调查员来了。

你不想对他们说谎，对吧？他们问，是谁做的？你看到了什么？你说，我看到B先生那天晚上在那里。

这是谎言吗？从技术上讲，你说的是真实发生的事情。这在事实上是真实的。B先生那天晚上确实在那里。

你那天晚上确实看到了B先生。但这个陈述的目的是什么？是误导。是隐藏。

是欺骗。你试图让他们去追查。你知道的，你是在

向他们抛出一个烟幕弹。因此，根据圣经，什么是不真实的话语？不真实的话语是任何试图故意向听者隐藏现实的话语。

每一个向你提问的听者，如果你对他们撒谎，那意味着你故意向他们隐瞒你所知道的现实。因此，如果你在欺骗，无论你所说的话在技术上是否真实，那都是谎言。而且是错误的。顺便说一句，结果就是，一旦你意识到圣经在这里所说的，它确实会扩展你的理解。不是吗？

不真实的言辞？所以有人曾经列出了这样一个小清单：礼貌性谎言、委婉语、夸张、词语膨胀，以及所谓的善意谎言。但它们都是谎言。所以这里有一个礼貌性谎言：我很想去，但我会不在城里。

但你不会不在城里。这里有一个委婉语：我认为你的写作对我们的读者来说太复杂了。而你的意思是它对我们的读者来说太糟糕了。但你不想说它很糟糕。

你会让他们不高兴。这是委婉语。这是谎言，明白吗？夸张。这在婚姻中很常见。

你总是，你从不出门，当然，这不是真的，因为你正在责备的人有时会做或有时确实会做，但当你说"你总是"、"你从不"时，从言语行为理论来看，即使这大部分是真的，你也是在猛击对方，而且你在夸张。所以对方会找到你所说的错误部分，这只会激化事态。你今晚会很晚才睡。或者词语膨胀。这里有一个例子。

现在想想这个，各位。这是基督徒特别会做的事情，但也可以在任何地方发生。每当教会的公开讨论是这样的：那真是一种祝福。主在那里。那简直太不可思议了。

现在的情况是，有时主确实在那里，有时确实是一种祝福，有时确实不可思议。当它总是一种祝福，总是不可思议时，你只是在制造犬儒主义，特别是在你的孩子中间。只是在制造犬儒主义。这是词语膨胀。所以你实际上

所做的不是，它是欺骗性的。它只是一种方式，它是炒作。炒作是欺骗性的。炒作不是现实。然后你还有一大堆小的，你所说的善意的谎言。

有些是纵容的谎言，比如当你不断为一个无能的朋友撒谎，而实际上你应该去面质他或她的生活方式。或者你有水门事件式的谎言。你知道什么是水门事件式的谎言吗？水门事件式的谎言就是，嗯，小人物们不会理解的。这对他们来说太复杂了。

所以我要说的是。这一切都是欺骗。过一种真实的生活意味着拒绝欺骗。第一点，第二点。其次，根据圣经，过一种真实的生活就是做出并遵守承诺。

这实际上出现在，尽管你可能不会立即看到，在第25节中。如果你是基督徒，你当然应该对每个人说实话。但在第25节中，它实际上说，要向你的邻舍说真话。现在在那种情况下，这可能听起来像是任何人，但接着它说，因为我们是一个身体的成员。在这里他谈论的是基督徒对基督徒。

而那个一个身体的成员是一个约的形象。约是一个协议。约是一个承诺。约是你通过签署合同或做出承诺而进入的公开承诺。在这里我们被告知基督徒是不害怕的人。

他们做出并遵守承诺。我们生活在一种文化中，在这种文化中，对个人自由有如此多的强调，个人自由，保持你的选择开放，以至于人们不再在他们过去常常做出承诺的地方做出承诺。如果他们确实做出了承诺，他们感到非常，非常自由地在承诺需要任何自我否定时就打破它们。让我给你两个例子，我马上就会反驳。两个例子，说明人们过去常常做出承诺，但现在他们不做出承诺的地方。

一个是不结婚就住在一起。其次，非常积极地参与教会却不加入。在这两种情况下，你都没有做出你过去习惯做的承诺。现在马上，有人会说，你是在把这两件事等同起来吗？我没有把它们等同起来。

我不是

说它们同样错误或糟糕。我想说的是，40年前，这两种情况都不太常见。而它们不常见的原因是，做出承诺、确定下来、让自己做出承诺，在某种意义上，让自己承诺并关闭其他选择，这在当时并不被认为是今天这样可怕的事情，但现在确实如此。所以这种观念渗透到我们所有人之中。问题之一是，我们实际上认为，原因之一是我们太看重自由，以至于觉得如果我做出承诺，做出保证，并且坚守它们，我就会失去自由，但这根本不是真的。

刘易斯·米兹在他的伟大著作《市长道德》中——这是对十诫的阐释——在某个地方谈到了这一点。他在谈论做出承诺、遵守承诺和宣誓。当他谈论这个话题时，你可以听出，他在某种程度上想到的是婚姻誓言，但实际上他在这段引文中所说的内容，对所有的承诺和保证都是真实的。他这样说：当我们做出承诺时，我们承担起与他人共创未来的责任，无论命运或天意会带来什么。这几乎是终极的自由。

当我做出承诺时，我证明了我与你的未来不是由我从家族基因库中抽到的那手牌决定的。当我做出承诺时，我证明了我不是被略显古怪的父母施加在我身上的心理影响沿着某条不可改变的路线引导的。我不是宿命的，我不是被决定的，我不是一块被过去的偶然强化和厌恶条件塑造成形的人类面团。现在我和其他人一样清楚，我的许多本质和所作所为都是来自过去的礼物或诅咒，但当我向任何人做出承诺时，我就超越了所有限制我的条件，从来没有德国牧羊犬承诺过陪伴我，从来没有计算机承诺过终身忠诚，只有人才能做出承诺，而当他这样做时，他是最自由的。你看，当你说，但如果我做出那个承诺，如果我做出那个保证，如果我承诺会在那里，那么我就不会有自由，

他说的恰恰相反，难道你不明白吗，如果你不做出承诺，那么你就是环境的奴隶，你是感觉的奴隶，你是恐惧的奴隶，你是冲动的奴隶，做出承诺吧。

这就是你在说，这就是我要成为的样子，无论发生什么其他事情我都不在乎，这让你更加自由。要成为有诚信的人，我们应该是不惧怕做出承诺和信守承诺的人。所以拒绝欺骗，遵守承诺，第三个方面是关于实践真理和诚实的，那就是自我的完整性，复数的自我，自我的完整性。看第25节，那里说，因此你们各人必须脱去虚假。但你知道原文希腊语说的是什么吗，你必须脱去伪装。

那就是希腊词，伪装（pseudo）。这就是他在谈论的。想想诚信（integrity）这个词。在英语中，它和整数（integer）这个词是一样的。什么是整数？

它是一个完整的数，不是分数，是不可分割的东西。它是一个完整的数。什么是诚信？一个有诚信的人在每个地方都有相同的自我。你不会有一个伪装的自我和一个真实的自我。

例如，一个缺乏诚信的人在私下是一种样子，在公开场合又是另一种样子。这就是为什么政客们应该真的小心那些现场麦克风。你在私下是一种样子，在公开场合又是另一种样子。没有诚信，你和这群人在一起是一种样子，和那群人在一起又完全是另一种样子。你说的话和你说的信念完全不同，完全不同。

然而，一个有诚信的人，在私下和公开场合是一样的。和这群人在一起和那群人在一起是一样的。你所想的和你所说的是一样的，你所说的和你所做的是一样的。你没有多重自我，一个真实的自我和一堆伪装的自我。你只有一个自我，一个真实的自我。

天哪，这是多么缺乏的。如果我有时间，我会谈谈所有那些文化原因，为什么文化实际上鼓励我们创造完全不同的自我。你觉得呢？你觉得所有那些网络名称是怎么回事？

是什么？你创造出完全不同的自我。

我们被这种现象所鼓励。但让我只举一个例子来说明它在一个领域中是多么具有破坏性，这就是我在开头提到的商业领域。几年前，一位正在写一本关于如何成为有诚信的商业领袖的书的人写下了这些事情。现在，我只是随手摘录了它们，因为它们很常见，但它们也很能说明问题。他说，不要公开声称追求质量，而私下里却设定不合理的截止日期，并且你所有的员工都知道这一点。

不要带朋友去公司的包厢看比赛，而每个人都知道你应该只带客户去那里。不要公开说一切都好，而你所有的员工都知道一切并不好。不要给管理层巨大的福利而不给其他人。不要在季度末之前下大量订单，因为即使你知道它们都会被取消，但这样会让本季度的数字看起来很好。当你听到这类事情时，你会突然意识到，哦，我的天哪，我们就沉浸在其中。

我回到那个比喻。不要让鱼告诉你什么是水，因为那样鱼会说，什么是水？因为鱼如此深处水中，鱼甚至看不到水是什么。也许我们已经到了这样一个地步，我们甚至不能对商界、政界、教会中的人，在现实生活中，对人们说，做有诚信的人，因为他们甚至不知道那是什么，因为他们太习惯于这个人所说的那种行为方式——不要做，不要做，但我们就沉浸在其中。这到处都是。

在整篇经文中，我们应该诚实的原因都回到了神身上。不是吗？我们应该公义、诚实和圣洁，因为神是诚实、公义和圣洁的。如果你是一个基督教信徒，其含义是令人震惊的。在登山宝训中有一处经文。

当你通读登山宝训时，很多内容都是有意义的。当你读到这一处时，它似乎并不合理。这是关于起誓的。有一处耶稣说，不要指着耶路撒冷城起誓，也不要指着你的头起誓，但要让你的

是就说是，不是就说不是。你说，什么意思？

这就是他所说的意思。在那些日子里，人们理解或相信，如果你以神的名义起誓，以神的名字起誓，那么你就永远不能违背你的誓言。这可能源于他们对十诫的理解，其中说，你不可妄称耶和华你神的名，这意味着你绝不能奉神的名起誓然后不履行。如果你援引神的名，那么你最好履行承诺。但他们说，如果你凭借其他东西起誓，如果你凭你父亲的坟墓起誓，或者如果你凭耶路撒冷城起誓，或者如果你凭自己的头起誓，那就不同了。

如果你像那样做出承诺，即使违背了也没那么糟糕。你知道耶稣在说什么吗，你绝不要相信那种说法。他说，你不明白吗？耶路撒冷是神的城市。你的头是神的，神创造了你的头。

你父亲的坟墓是神的。他说，你难道不明白吗？每一个是和每一个不是，你每天说的每一句话，每一句闲话都是在起誓，就像你在起誓一样，因为你正站在伟大君王的宝座前。绝对地，没有什么真实性的等级之分。绝对地，你说的每一句话实际上都是在起誓。如果我告诉你明天会有人跟着你，并且会录像，录下你做的每一件事和你说的每一句话，你会更诚实地说话吗？

你会更加小心吗？你如何对你的配偶或朋友说话，或对你正在推销业务的人、潜在客户说话，你会更加小心吗？如果你知道这一切都被录下来，然后明天会被放到网上，你会更加小心吗？我会的，你也会的。如果我们是基督徒，我们就是傻瓜。

因为我们确实会更加小心。然而耶稣基督说，你难道不明白你所受的审视远比那更严格吗？你的每一句话都被追究着远比几千人在网上观看更大的责任。神，真理之神，公义之神，圣洁之神，你正站在他面前。诗篇能

深刻地塑造你接近上帝的方式。

甚至耶稣也依靠诗篇来面对每一种处境，包括死亡。在提姆和凯西·凯勒的365天灵修读物《耶稣之歌》中，你会发现每日阅读诗篇并获得新鲜的圣经见解。如果你还没有定期的灵修习惯，这本书是开始的绝佳方式。如果你已经花时间在学习和祷告上，那么阅读和祷告诗篇可以帮助你将最深的情感和问题带到上帝面前，发现与祂亲密关系的新层次。我们会送你提姆和凯西·凯勒的灵修读物，作为对你帮助福音与生命向更多人分享耶稣之爱的礼物的感谢。

他在第15节中暗示了这一点。当他不只是说，而是在爱中说真话。他不只是说说真话。他说在爱中说真话。不只是说说真话。

他说在爱中。好吧，这很好。当你看到这一点时，你可能会想，好的，所以要真实但要加上爱。所以真理是一回事，爱是另一回事。但当你读到第29节，最后一节时，你会看到保罗在提出一个多么了不起的观点，因为他说，不要让任何污秽的话从你们口中出来。

污秽这个词字面意思是腐烂的。这是一个意味着腐败的词。这是一个意味着导致衰败和瓦解的词。好的。那么什么是污秽的话？

污秽的话是任何不是为了造就、不是为了使人受益而设计的话。你会说，这是什么意思？那些不是为了造就和使人受益的真话。即使是真话也是腐烂的。答案是肯定的，这就是保罗所说的。

腐烂的。那么什么是污秽的话？这是什么意思？嗯，一方面，你知道，我仍然总是，我总是

我对莎士比亚戏剧《亨利五世》中的一个场景感到惊讶，就是在他们入侵法国时，英国人正在入侵法国，他因为抢劫而绞死了一个人。在某个时刻，他转身对所有士兵说："我不会让法国人受到贬低或用轻蔑的语言辱骂。"

好的。是的，我们是来征服他们的，但我们不会用轻蔑的语言说话。我们不会辱骂他们。这显然就是它的意思，但我相信保罗不仅仅是在谈论辱骂性的、愤怒的、刺耳的语气，尽管他当然也在说这个。

如果你用辱骂性的、刺耳的、愤怒的方式说真话，那是腐烂的，那是发臭的，那是错误的，那是有罪的。"我在说真话，这无关紧要"——这就是原因。当你用辱骂的方式说真话，当你用真话来痛打别人时，你真的关心真理吗？你真的在捍卫真理吗？不，你是在捍卫你自己。

但保罗不仅仅是在谈论明显的辱骂性话语。他是在说任何实际上不是为了造就和建立人的话。这很惊人。当你对某人说真话时，你的目标是什么？我们又回到了言语行为理论。

好吧，也许你说的是真的，技术上是真的，教义上是真的，准确的，但你是在试图在别人眼中边缘化这个人吗？你是在试图痛打这个人吗？你是在试图惩罚他们吗？你是在试图让他们认清自己的位置吗？你是在试图从其他人那里获得掌声，因为你对他们如此严厉吗？

保罗说这些都不对。任何人如果基本上用真理来痛打别人，以便为自己获得更多的权力和地位，就是在滥用真理。你并不是在捍卫真理，你是在捍卫自己。你在利用真理来获取自己的权力和地位。顺便说一下，在这一点上，你会意识到我们来到了一个地方，我们来到了当今世界，特别是在我们的文化中，对教会的主要反对意见之一。

福柯、尼采，那些人

多年来，许多人，包括福柯这样的人，一直在说，当基督徒声称拥有真理时，他们实际上只是在利用真理来获取权力。著名的法国哲学家福柯说，真理是这个世界的产物。它是通过多种形式的约束产生的，并产生常规的权力效应。每个社会都有其真理体制。他基本上是在说，真理声称就是权力游戏。

那么，当基督徒听到这些时应该怎么做呢？我会告诉你根据圣经他们应该怎么做。他们应该做的第一件事不是变得防御性地说，等一下，真的存在绝对真理。他们应该悔改。原因如下。

早在福柯之前，早在尼采之前，早在马克思之前，耶稣就说过这样的话：你们法利赛人有祸了，因为你们喜爱会堂里的首位和市场上的问候。你们有祸了，因为你们把难担的重担放在人身上，自己连一个指头也不肯动来帮助他们。他在说什么？他在说那些利用上帝的律法、真理、圣经来获得社会地位、高地位，并压制人民的人。这正是福柯和尼采所说的。

是的。看，耶稣基督多年前就用福音来拆解保罗所谈论的，以及世界上许多不喜欢基督教的人所抱怨的东西。如果你从上帝的白白恩典中获得你的价值感和意义，如果你知道自己有任何价值的原因只是上帝的自由之爱和恩典。那么上帝的真理就只是成为使他喜悦的一种方式。这是你所爱的东西。

所以，如果你从上帝的恩典中获得价值感，你就爱真理。但是，如果你从正确中获得价值感，如果你从拥有真理、准确无误中获得价值感和意义，并且为真理而不是为上帝而重视真理，你就是在向真理寻求只有上帝才能给你的东西。一种认为你一定是个有价值、重要的人的感觉，因为你如此了解真理等等。看，耶稣多年前就称之为道德主义、法利赛主义，并将其拆解。而且

因此，基督徒在某些方面站在一块非常狭窄的土地上。

事实上，对大多数人来说，这条路是看不见的，因为这边有些人基本上在说，谁能说什么是真理？真理是什么？你知道，每个人都必须为自己决定什么是真理。他们要么否认真理的存在，要么对真理玩弄花招。而另一边，你有些人说，是的，有真理，这就是绝对真理，然后他们用它来打击别人，耶稣说，保罗说，这两种都是糟糕的。

如果你是一个正直的人，你不会做这两种事。一个用真理来打击别人的人并不是真正地看重真理，你看重的是你自己。你知道，那些非基督徒思想家看到了这一点，也知道这一点。所以有两个问题。你知道，一方面我们害怕，我们害怕诚实。

你知道一直说真话有什么难的吗？你知道遵守承诺和做出承诺有什么难的吗？你知道正直有什么难的吗？它是可怕的。你知道它是可怕的。

我的意思是，如果我一直说真话，如果我只是让每个人都知道，但是你知道我们害怕，这就是我们撒谎的原因。这就是我一直撒谎的原因。当我撒谎时，我撒谎是因为我害怕。但另一方面，你有骄傲。你知道，马丁·路德说，基督徒就像一个醉汉，从马的一边掉下来后，立刻爬上马，然后又从另一边掉下来。

所以我们现在被困在两种文化之间。听我说。一方面，我们确实有一个问题。我们有一种相对主义的文化。确实是这样。

他们确实在说谁能说什么是真理。没有人能说什么是对错。所有的真理和道德都是文化相对的。现在我们在那里遇到的一个坏问题，而且几乎是个笑话，就是我们变得非常不安。我们告诉孩子们没有对错。

你必须自己决定。没有真理这回事，然后当他们进入社会后撒谎和欺骗时，我们就变得非常不安。C.S. 路易斯在他的《人之废除》中这样说：我们大声呼求那些

我们却又一方面要求那些美德的出现。

我们嘲笑“荣誉”这个观念——我们嘲笑“荣誉”和“真理”的观念；我们嘲笑“荣誉”，然后又惊讶地发现，身边尽是叛徒。我们阉割掉人，却要求太监结出果子。这就是他在说的：我们告诉孩子，“所有真理、所有道德都是文化相对的——谁能说什么是真理呢？”然后，同一时间，我们又一边喊叫：“看看这些败坏！看看这些作弊的人！看看这些不诚实的人！”真理是相对的，可你为什么不诚实？我们一边让那些品格不可能长成，一边又要求它们长成。

我们嘲笑“荣誉”，却又惊讶于叛徒的出现；我们把人阉割掉，却要求太监结出果子——要求他们发展出美德、诚实、正直，而他们根本办不到。所以，一方面我们活在这样的社会里；另一方面，那种环境也诱惑我们走向另一个极端：成为用“污秽言语”的人，成为那些不再用真理去建造、不再用真理去造就人的人。

你知道，我们不是用真理来处理问题，而是直接攻击人——我们用真理攻击人本身。于是，我们就成了“真理党”：真理在我们这边，别人都不对。另一个极端则是“爱心党”：啊，只要接纳每个人就好。但问题是：没有爱的真理不再是真理，而是权力的工具；没有真理的爱也不再是爱，而只不过是懦弱或思想上的偷懒。真理和爱必须在一起，否则它们就不能各自为“真理”和“爱”。

明白吗？这就是保罗在这里要说的：没有爱的真理不再是真理，没有真理的爱也不再是爱。除非它们在一起，否则就都不是它们自己。那么我们该怎么办呢？我们来看耶稣。

在约翰福音第十八章——我这周才注意到——那里其实有两场审判。耶稣在被钉十字架前，先被拉到大祭司和宗教领袖面前。他们是他一直以来批评的那些“道德主义者”。在那里，耶稣说什么？他说：“我向你们说明真理。”然后，他们打他。

接着，在同一章里，他又被带到彼拉多面前。那是一位相对主义者，掌权者。当他站在宗教领袖面前时，他说：“我为真理作见证。”他们打他。到了彼拉多面前，他几乎用了一模一样的话：“我为真理作见证。”你知道彼拉多怎么说吗？“真理是什么呢？”然后他们把耶稣杀了。

我要你看清这一幕当中的奇妙之处。首先，要看耶稣那令人惊叹的“正直”：耶稣基督是何等有“诚信”的一位人！为什么？因为他在两个场景里是同一个样子，在任何地方都没有虚假。他在这边是怎样，在那边就是怎样。在这边是道德主义者，是那些他一直斥责的宗教领袖；在那边是相对主义者，是那位问“真理是什么”的彼拉多。耶稣在两边说的是一样的话。他不是“两套人格”，他不是“两种人”。留意这一点：他在这两个场景中不仅是一样的，而且他们两边都同样恨他、打他、要杀他。

为什么？因为奇怪的是，道德主义者和相对主义者，其实都在追求权力。相对主义者说“谁能说什么是真理呢”，是为了掌控权力；道德主义者说“真理在我们这边”，也是为了掌控权力。而耶稣基督恰恰相反：他坚定地站在自己的正直上，绝对的正直，“我为真理作见证”。他在两边都一样，结果呢？这样的正直把他带上了十字架——因为他是用真理来服事我们，而他们却是用真理来掌控我们。

他的正直把他带上了十字架。但他为什么愿意上十字架？这就是解答所在。请让我问你一个问题：耶稣基督上十字架，是为了真理吗？是不是为了表明：上帝的律法不可以被轻忽？为了表明：上帝的圣洁、公义必须得到满足？他是为了“真理”而上十字架的吗？还是他为了“爱”而上十字架——好叫我们这些有罪的人成为蒙赦免的人，好叫我们这些有过犯的人仍然可以被拥抱、被接纳？他是为了“真理”上十字架呢，还是为了“爱”上十字架？

各位，答案是——两者都是。他一死，上帝的真理就被无限地满足了，因为他完全履行了“爱神”的律法一切要求；但同一刻，上帝的爱也被无限地满足了，因为现在他可以在不否认真理的前提下完全拥抱我们、赦免我们、接纳我们。

他在彼拉多面前也用同样的话说：“我为真理作见证。”你知道彼拉多怎么说吗？“真理是什么呢？”然后他们把他杀了。

十字架把真理和爱连在一起。我知道，在这个世界里，有时候在我们自己的生命中，它们看起来像是彼此对立的。好像如果我要说真话，我就不知道那是不是爱的表现——换句话说，它们似乎是彼此冲突的。但在十字架上，它们并没有冲突；当十字架来到你生命的中心时，它们在你里面也不会互相冲突。你知道为什么吗？

十字架使你脱离那种让你对真理含糊其词、玩弄真理的恐惧，因为耶稣基督那么爱你，以至于为你而死；同时，十字架也使你脱离那种让你用真理去伤人的骄傲，因为耶稣基督必须为你而死。

你是那么有罪，以至于他必须为你而死。所以，那种推动你用真理去伤人的骄傲，被十字架除去了；而那种让我们闪躲、躲避、玩弄真理的恐惧，也被十字架除去了。我们的心被十字架的爱充满，于是我们就可以这样做。

第 29 节，我知道中文译本翻成类似「只要说造就人的好话」，但希腊原文更字面的意思是：你只该说那些「把恩典带给听见的人」的话。

当你从耶稣基督十字架上领受恩典之后，你才可以带着恩典说真话，而且只有那时你才能这么做。或者我们可以换一种方式来讲。是的，就像超能先生所说的：「我还有时间。」我们还可以再讲一件事。起初——不要想太多皮克斯电影本身——在历史的起初，那是一个灾难。亚当、夏娃，你知道的，以甸园里发生了什么：罪、蛇，你熟悉这个故事。一切都变得可怕：死亡、毁坏、邪恶，一切都糟透了，除了一个转机——还有一点盼望。那是什么呢？

是一个应许。创世记 3:15，上帝说：「我应许，将来女人的一个后裔要伤蛇的头，要毁灭邪恶。」这是一个应许。

再往前翻，几个世纪之后，上帝开始对亚伯兰说话，说：「我要借着你的后裔拯救世界。」有一晚，亚伯兰说：「但我怎么能确定呢？」

在创世记 15 章，上帝震惊了亚伯拉罕，也震惊了任何真正懂得他在做什么的人——当他显现并从被劈开的牲畜之间经过的时候，他是在说：「即便为此我必须死，我也要借你的一个后裔来拯救世界。」

这是第二个应许。

多年以后，耶稣基督来到世上，他是一个满有完全正直的人，完全的正直。他说的每一句话都是他心里所想的，他心里所想的每件事，他都照实说出来，绝对的正直。但在最后，在那终极的正直行动里，他「硬着脸面」往耶路撒冷去，他往十字架那里去——为什么？因为他要成就他的应许。

他在成就上帝的应许。

当时一切都迎面而来，一切都压在他身上，一切都与他为敌，连阴间本身都倾倒在他身上，他却说：「不，我已经立了约。」于是他走向十字架，为我们而死。

你是靠着耶稣的正直得救的，你是靠着耶稣守约的信实得救的。这应该把我们谦卑到一个地步，使我们再也不会用真理去伤人；但另一方面，它也说服我们：真理确实存在，而且我们绝不能对真理退缩。它摧毁了我们在讲真话时的恐惧。因此，哦，朋友们，看一看耶稣的正直，看一看他在十字架上为你所做的工，成为一个有正直的人吧。

我们一起祷告。

天父，我们感谢你，让我们看见这样一位耶稣基督——他守尽一切应许，他是正直的人，他用真理来拯救我们，而不是来利用我们。

父啊，每当我们否认真理、或为了保全自己不愿说真理，或当我们拿真理去伤害别人、去获取我们想要的权力和地位的时候，我们就是把眼目从你的儿子转开。

他是道路、真理、生命，却在十字架上永远向我们显出：真理和爱怎样联合在一起。

它们如同一体，永不分离。我们祈求，那十字架上耶稣所成就的异象，能使真理与爱在我们自己生命里一同成长、携手而行。

我们祈求你使我们成为一个正直的群体；我们祈求你帮助我们，知道在当下这个不愿听真理的文化中，我们该怎样说真话；我们祈求你帮助我们，知道在必须作一个正直之人的时候，我们应当成为什么样的人。

我们奉耶稣的名求，阿们。
