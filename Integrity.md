### 引言：诚信的困境

当马克·吐温还是个男孩时，有一天他走在街上，看到一辆装满西瓜的车。他喜欢西瓜，于是悄悄靠近，偷了一个，跑到小巷里咬了一口。然而刚咬下去，一种奇怪的感觉涌上心头。他毫不犹豫地走回车边，放回了那个西瓜——然后**偷了一个熟的**。

这个故事讲起来容易接受，比起偷情或偷钱，偷西瓜似乎无伤大雅。但这恰恰说明了问题：我们对诚信的标准有多低，我们多容易让一些"小谎言"轻易滑过。

### 第一部分：诚信的反面是不诚实

诗篇15篇描述了一个正直的人：说真话、行公义、不受贿、即使吃亏也守约。

#### 1. 不要撒谎

耶稣在登山宝训中说："你们不可起誓……你们的话，是，就说是；不是，就说不是。"

什么意思？有些人认为只有在起誓时才必须说实话，平时可以打折扣。耶稣说：**不存在"真话的等级"**。你说的每一句"是"或"不是"，在神看来都是誓言。

马太福音12章说，我们要为每一句闲话交账。

想象一下，如果明天你的每句话都被录像，然后通过卫星向二十亿人播放，这会影响你明天说话的方式吗？当然会。但耶稣告诉我们：**你的实际处境比这更严重**，因为神在看着，祂的审判比二十亿人的意见重要得多。

#### 2. 不要违约

第4节说："他发了誓，虽然自己吃亏，也不更改。"

**什么是承诺？** 切斯特顿说，承诺是你与未来的自己定的约会。

当你承诺"我会爱你"，你是在说："我拒绝被我的基因、脑化学、社会或历史推来推去。无论发生什么，五年后我都会在那里。"

承诺带来自由，违约带来奴役。

托马斯·莫尔快要被烧死时，他的女儿恳求他收回承诺保命。莫尔说："梅格，当一个人起誓时，他把自己握在手中，就像握着水一样。如果他张开手指，就不要指望再找回自己了。"

### 第二部分：诚信的赝品是虚伪

诗篇15篇第2节不只说这人"说真话"，而是说他"**从心里说真话**"。

"诚信"（integrity）这个词和"整数"（integer）是同一个词根。整数是完整的数，不是分数。一个有诚信的人是**表里如一**的人。

虚伪（hypocrisy）在希腊语中是"演员"的意思。虚伪的人就是在演戏——外表一套，内心另一套。

我在南方牧会时，走进一个房间，人们在说："你知道是什么让这个国家伟大吗？工会！没有工会我们还在种稻子呢！"然后走进另一个房间，人们在说："你知道是什么在毁掉这个国家吗？工会！"

他们都问我："牧师，你说是不是？"我怎么回答的？我说："嗯，有道理……"

你看，我不是一个有诚信的人。

### 第三部分：如何培养诚信

诗篇15篇末尾说："行这些事的人，必永不动摇。"  
诗篇16篇中间说："我将耶和华常摆在我面前……我便不致动摇。"

**要过完全诚信的生活，必须将神常摆在你面前。**

#### 1. 认识到你需要神

谎言从哪里开始？从伊甸园开始。当亚当夏娃决定自己做主，不再完全依靠神，他们就与现实脱节了，**不得不开始躲藏**。这就是一切不诚实的根源。

为什么你那么难承认自己错了？  
为什么你总是要说服自己是某个人物？  
为什么你那么难听取批评？  
为什么你总是把问题怪到别人头上？

所有这些不诚实，都来自于**不愿承认我们需要神，不愿承认我们完全依靠祂**。

耶稣讲过一个比喻：两个儿子被叫去干活，一个说"我去"却没去，另一个说"我不去"却在最后时刻改变主意去了。哪个是顺服的？

法利赛人说是第二个。耶稣说："所以我告诉你们，税吏和娼妓倒比你们先进神的国。"

为什么？因为法利赛人不愿承认自己的软弱和罪。而**承认自己的不诚实，是诚实的开始**。

#### 2. 在耶稣里找到神

耶稣对彼拉多说："我就是真理。凡属真理的人就听我的话。"

知道真理是一回事，拥有真理是一回事，努力行真理是一回事——但**怎样才能让真理流淌在你的血管里**？

只有当你爱耶稣基督，祂的生命进入你、渗透你，只有当你活得好像神时刻在你面前，你才能过诚信的生活。

当你向祂敞开心扉，祂就向你敞开心扉，然后你才能向别人敞开心扉。只有那时，你才能过完全诚信的生活。

### 结语

你知道那意味着什么吗？  
意味着真诚到如此地步，简单到如此地步，你的心像一潭清澈的湖水，别人可以看到底。  
意味着你是一个有点严肃但又非常平易近人的人。  
人们可能会因为你的诚实而有点怕你，但他们会想和你打交道，因为他们知道你说话算话，因为他们知道你基本上是有爱心、公平的。

你是这样的人吗？

去找祂。向祂敞开心扉。将祂常摆在你面前，你就必永不动摇。

## English Transcript / 英文原文

today as Tim Keller explores one of the fruit of the Spirit. The reading for today is taken from the Book of Ephesians chapter 4 verses 14 and 15,  20 through 25 and verse 29. Then we will no longer be infants tossed back and forth by the waves  and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men  in their deceitful scheming. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up  into Him who is the head that is Christ. You, however, did not come to know Christ that way.

Surely you heard of Him and were taught in Him according with the truth that is in Jesus. You were taught with regard to your former way of life to put off your old self,  which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires, to be made new in the attitudes of your minds,  and to put on the new self created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness. Therefore, each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor,  for we are all members of one body. Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths,  but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs  that it may benefit those who will listen. This is the word of the Lord.

Galatians 5, verses 22 to 23, lists what's called the fruit of the Spirit. These are  characteristics, descriptors of a supernaturally changed heart, love, joy, peace, patience,  and we're looking at one each week so that perhaps we can have more of the supernatural change in our  own lives. Today we come to faithfulness. The word faithfulness is honesty, integrity, truthfulness,  and this is a great text that we're going to be looking at so we can take a deeper look at what  that means. There couldn't be a more relevant topic.

Because of the economic crisis, the recession,  and the revelations that have come out, since then, our trust, Americans trust of their  institutions, business, government, church, is that an all-time low, all the studies show that,  because there is a sense that there's been a failure of integrity in our society at all levels. And what does the Bible have to say about this, therefore, very relevant and all-important subject? This particular text is going to show us that there are two problems with regard to truth. There's  a problem of practicing truthfulness, but then there's also a problem of abusing people with  the truth. So there's a problem of practicing truth, and then there's a problem of abusing people  with the truth, and then we're going to see what the solution is, how we solve both problems.

Okay? First, first there's the problem of practicing truth. It's a very demanding thing,  according to the Bible, and what's great about this passage is there's three very important aspects  to being truthful people that are all mentioned. What does it mean to be truthful? First, it means  to refuse to deceive people, to not deceive people.

Notice verse 14 and 15, verse 15 says,  instead speak the truth, instead of what? And in verse 14 it says, cunning, craftiness, and deceit. Now, this is extremely important, because if you and I tend to think of lying strictly as conveying  inaccurate statements. But the Bible long ago understood what today is called speech act theory. You know what speech act theory is?

Speech act theory is the insight that every word is actually  also a deed. We tend to say word deed or two different things, but every word is really a deed. That is, every word is not only designed to convey information, it's also designed to get  something done. It's got an intention, it's got a purpose. And in order to evaluate a word,  or a phrase, you need to not only evaluate whether it's conveying fruit, accurate information,  but also evaluate what its purpose is.

So for example, there's been a theft at the office,  your office. And you know, Mr. A did it, but you want to protect and cover for Mr. A. So the  investigators come.

And you don't want to lie to them, see? And they say, who did it? What did you see? And you say, I saw Mr. B there that very night.

Is that a lie? Technically,  you're telling the per- you're saying what actually happened. It's factually true. Mr. B was there  that night.

You did see Mr. B there that night. But what's the purpose of this statement? It's misdirection. It's to hide.

It's to deceive. You're trying to get them to run down. You know,  you're throwing them a red herring. And therefore, what is, according to the Bible, an untruthful  word? An untruthful word is any word that deliberately tries to hide reality from the listener.

Every listener that asks you a question, if you lie to them, that means you are deliberately  withholding reality as you know it to be from them. And therefore, if you're deceiving, whether or  not what you said is technically true or not, that's a lie. And it's wrong. And as a result, by the  way, what that does mean is once you realize what the Bible is saying here, it does expand your  understanding. Does it not?

A untruthful speech? So somebody once made this little list, polite  lies, euphemisms, exaggerations, word inflation, and so-called benevolent lies. But they're all lies. So here's a polite lie. I would love to go, but I'll be out of town.

But you won't be out of town. Here's a euphemism. I think your writing is too sophisticated for our readers. When you mean  it's too terrible for our readers. But you don't want to say it's terrible.

You upset them. It's a  euphemism. It's a lie, see? Exaggeration. This works inside marriage.

You always, you never  went out, of course, that's not true because the person you are berating sometimes does  or sometimes does, but when you say you always, you never, what you're actually what speech act  theory here, you know, even if it's pretty much true, you're bludgeoning the person besides that  you're exaggerating. So the person's going to find the part of what you're saying that's wrong  and just going to inflame things. You're going to be up very late tonight. Or word inflation. And here's  something.

Now think about this, everybody. This is something that Christians do particularly,  but it can be done everywhere. Whenever public discourse in a church is, it was, it's such a blessing. The Lord was there. It was just incredible.

Now what happens is sometimes the Lord is there  and sometimes it is a blessing and sometimes it's incredible. When it's always a blessing,  it's always incredible. You're just creating cynicism, especially amongst your kids. Just creating cynicism. It's word inflation.

So what you're actually doing is it's not, it's  deceptive. It's just a way of always, it's hype. Hype is deceptive. Hype isn't reality. And then  you've got a whole pile of the little, what you call benevolent lies.

There's enabling  lives like when you continually lie for an incompetent friend, when you actually ought to be confronting  him or her about how they're living. Or then you have watergate lies. You know what watergate  lies are? Watergate lies are, well the little people wouldn't understand. It's just too complicated  for them.

So this is what I'm going to say. This is all deception. To live a life of truthfulness  means to refuse to deceive. Number one, number two. Secondly, to live a life of truthfulness  according to the Bible is to make and keep promises.

That actually comes out, though you might not  see it immediately, in verse 25. We should, if you're a Christian, you should tell the truth  everybody, of course. But in verse 25, it actually says, speak truthfully to your neighbor. Now that  might sound in that case like anybody, but then it says, for we are members of one body. And here  he's talking about Christian to Christian.

And that members of one body is a covenant image. A covenant is an agreement. A covenant is a commitment. A covenant is a public commitment you  enter into by signing a contract or making a promise. And here we're told the Christians are people  who are not afraid of.

They make and they keep promises. We live in a culture in which there is  so much emphasis on personal freedom, personal freedom, keeping your options open, that people no  longer make promises at places that they used to. And if they do make them, they feel very, very  free to break them as soon as it entails any self-denial at all. Let me just give you two examples  and I'll immediately backpile. Two examples of places where people used to make promises, but now  they don't make promises.

One is living together without being married. Secondly, being very involved  in the church without joining. In both cases, you're not making the promise that you used it. Now right  away, somebody is going to say, are you equating those two things? I am not equating them.

I'm not  saying they're equally wrong or bad. What I'm saying is 40 years ago, neither of them happened  very much. And the reason they didn't happen very much was because the idea of making a promise and  nailing it down and committing yourself in a sense, committing yourself and shutting down your  options wasn't considered the horrible thing that it is today, but it is. And so it permeates us  all. And one of the problems is that we actually think, one of the reasons is we're so big on  our freedom that we feel like if I make promises and I make commitments and I stick with them,  that somehow I lose my freedom and that is not true at all.

Lewis Meads, in his great book,  Mayor Morality, which is an exhibition of the Ten Commandments, talks about this at one place. He's talking about making promises and keeping commitments and taking vows. And he's thinking,  you can hear when he talks about it, he's thinking somewhat about the marriage vow, but he's actually  what he's saying in this quote, is true of all promises and all commitments. He says this,  when we make a promise, we take it on ourselves to create a future with someone else, no matter  what fate or destiny may have in store. This is almost ultimate freedom.

When I make a promise,  I bear witness that my future with you is not determined by the hand I was dealt out of my  family's genetic deck. When I make a promise, I testify that I was not routed along some  unalterable itinerary by the psychic conditioning visited on me by my slightly wacky parents. I am not faded, I am not determined, I am not a lump of human dough whipped into shape by the  contingent reinforcement and averse of conditioning in my past. Now I know as well as the next person  that much of what I am and what I do is a gift or a curse from my past, but when I make a promise to  anyone, I rise above all the conditioning that limits me, no German shepherd ever promised  to be there with me, no computer ever promised to be loyal for life, only a person can make a promise  and when he does, he is most free. You see, when you say, but if I make that promise, if I make that  commitment, if I promise to be there, then I won't have my freedom, and what he's saying is the  opposite, don't you realize that if you don't make a promise, then you are a slave to circumstances,  you're a slave to feelings, you're a slave to fears, you're a slave to impulses, make a promise.

And that's your way of saying, this is the way I'm going to be and I don't care about whatever else  happens, and that makes you more free. And to be people of integrity, we should be people who are  not afraid of making promises and keeping promises. So refusing to deceive, making keeping promises  and the third aspect of what it means to practice the truth and be truthful is integrity of selves,  plural, integrity of selves. Look at verse 25, where it says, therefore each of you must put off  falsehood. But you know what it says in the original Greek is, you must put off the pseudo.

That's the Greek word, the pseudo. And this is what he is talking about. Think of the word integrity. In English, it's the same as the word integer. What is an integer?

It's a whole number,  not a fraction, something that can't be divided. It's a whole number. What is integrity? A person  of integrity has the same self in every place. You don't have a pseudo self in a real self.

So for example, a person who lacks integrity is one way in private and another way in public. This is the reason why politicians should be really careful about those live microphones. You're one way in private and another way in public. Without integrity, you are one way with this  group and a total another way with this group. You talk a completely different line than this,  what you say, what you say you believe, it's totally different.

A person of integrity, however,  is the same in private as in public. The same with this group as with that group. The same in what  you think with what you say and the same with what you say with what you do. You don't have multiple  selves, a real self and a bunch of pseudo selves. You've got one self, one real self.

And boys is lacking. If I had time, I would talk about all the cultural reasons why  we're actually encouraged by the culture to create totally different selves. What do you think? What do you think all those internet names are? You create totally different selves.

We're encouraged  by it. But let me just give you one example of how devastating it is in just one area, which I  mentioned at the top, which is business. A man who was some years ago just writing a book on  how to have integrity as a business leader just wrote these things. Now, I just pulled them off  because they're routine, but they also are very revealing. He says, don't say publicly where for quality,  but privately you have unreasonable deadlines and all your employees know it.

Don't take friends to company box seats when everybody knows you should only be bringing clients  there. Don't say publicly everything is fine when all your employees know everything is not fine. Don't give huge perks to management and not to others. Don't put in a big number of orders  right before the end of the quarter because even though you know they will all be cancelled,  it will look so good in the figures for the quarter. When you hear that kind of thing,  you suddenly realize, oh my word, we just swim in that.

I'm back to the illustration. Don't ask a fish  to tell you about water because then the fish will say, well, what's water? Because the fish is so  in the water, the fish doesn't even see the earth's water. And maybe we're getting to the  place where we can't even say to people in business, in government, in the church, in real life,  just life, be people of integrity because they don't even know what that is because they're so used  to the kind of behavior that this man said, don't do, don't do, but we just swim in it. It's just everywhere.

All through this passage, the reason why we should be truthful comes back to God. Does it not? We should be righteous and truthful and holy because God is truthful and righteous and holy. And the implication of that, if you're a Christian believer, is astonishing. There's a place  in the Sermon on the Mount.

When you read through the Sermon on the Mount, a lot of this stuff makes  sense. When you get to this place, it doesn't seem to make sense. It's about oaths. And there's a place  where Jesus says, don't swear by the city of Jerusalem and don't swear by your head, but let your  yes be yes, and let your no be no. And you say, what?

And here's what he meant by that. In those days, it was understood or believed that if you swore by God, the name of God,  then you couldn't ever break your oath. That probably goes to their understanding of the 10  commandments, which says, you must not take the name of the Lord that God invades, which means  you must never take the name of God on and then not follow through. If you invoke God's name,  then you better follow through. But they said, if you swear on something else, if you swear on  your father's grave, or if you swear on the city of Jerusalem, or if you swear on your own head,  that's different.

If you make a promise like that, it's not so bad if you break it. And you know what  Jesus is saying, don't you dare believe that. He says, don't you understand? Jerusalem is God's  city. Your head is God's, God made your head.

Your father's grave is God's. He says, don't you realize  that every yes and every no, everything you say every day, every idle word is under oath,  as much under oath as if you were because you are standing before the throne of the great king. Absolutely, there's no levels of truthfulness. Absolutely, everything you say is actually under oath. If I told you that tomorrow somebody's going to follow you around and it's going to video,  every single thing you do and every single thing you say, would you speak with more integrity?

Would you be more careful? How you spoke to your spouse or to your friends or to the person  that you're pitching a deal to, a prospective client, would you be at all more careful? If you knew it was being recorded and then tomorrow it was going to be put up on the internet,  would you be more careful? I would and you would. And if we're Christians, we're fools.

Because it's true that we would be more careful. And yet Jesus Christ says, don't you realize you're  you're under way more scrutiny than that. Every single one of your words is being held a far greater  accountability than a few thousand people watching it on the internet. God, the God of truth, the God  of righteousness, the God of holiness, you're standing right before Him. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God.

Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face  every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365-day devotional, the Songs of Jesus,  you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a regular  devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start. And if you already spend time in study  and prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest emotions and  questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with Him. We'll send you Tim and Kathy  Keller's devotional is our thanks for your gift to help gospel and life share the love of Jesus  with more people.

So you see the problem and the difficulty of practicing the truth, but that's not the only problem  that Paul brings out here. It's not the only problem with regard to the truth. There's a second problem  and it's fascinating to me.

He hints at it in verse 15. When he doesn't just say,  instead speak the truth in love. He doesn't just say speak the truth. He says speak the truth in love. Doesn't just say speak the truth.

He says in love. Okay, well that's nice. When you look at that,  you kind of think, okay, so be truthful but add love. So truth is one thing and love is another  thing. But when you get down to verse 29, the last verse, then you see how remarkable what a  remarkable point Paul is making because he says, do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your  mouth.

That word unwholesome literally means rotten. It's a word that means putrefying. It's a word  that means leading to decay and disintegration. Okay. And then so what is an unwholesome word?

An  unwholesome word is anything that is not supposed, is not designed to build up, not designed to benefit. And you say, what does that mean? The true words that are not designed to build up and benefit  the person. Even true words are rotten. And the answer is yes, that's what Paul is saying.

Rotten. So what are unwholesome words? What does this mean? Well on the one hand, you know,  I still always am, I'm always amazed by the one place in Henry V in the play, the Shakespeare play  Henry V when he's just hung a man for, you know, he's, they're invading France and the  English are invading France and he hangs a man for pillaging, I think. And at one point, he turns  around and he actually says to all of his soldiers, he says, I will not have the French  upgraded nor abused in disdainful language.

Okay. Yeah, we're here to conquer them but we're not. We're not going to speak disdainfully. We're not going to abrade them. Now that clearly is what it  means, but I believe Paul is not just talking about abusive, you know, angry harsh tones, though  he certainly is saying that.

If you say the truth, in abusive, harsh, angry ways,  that's rotten, that stinks, that's wrong, that's sinful. What I'm telling the truth, it doesn't  matter and here's the reason why. When you tell the truth in abusive ways, when you beat people  up with the truth, are you really caring about the truth? Are you really valiant for the truth? No,  you're valiant for yourself.

But Paul's not only talking about, I think, overtly abusive  words. He is saying anything that's not actually designed to benefit and build up. That's amazing. When you tell the truth to somebody, is your goal? Here we are back to speech act theory.

Okay,  maybe what you're saying is true, technically true, doctrinally true, you know, accurate,  but are you trying to marginalize the person in the eyes of others? Are you trying to beat the  person up? Are you trying to punish them? Are you trying to put them in their place? Are you trying  to get applause from other people because you're being so hard on them?

Paul says none of those  are right. Anyone who uses the truth basically to beat the person up in order to get more power and  status for yourself is abusing the truth. And you're not valiant for the truth, you're valiant for  yourself. You're using the truth for your own power and status. And at this point, by the way,  you realize that we're coming to a place where we're coming to one of the main objections  that the world out there today, especially in our culture, has about the church.

Foucault, Nietzsche, those kinds of people, have said now for years that when Christians claim  to have the truth, they're really basically just using the truth to get on top. So Foucault is a famous place where the French philosopher Foucault says truth is a thing of this  world. It is produced by virtue of multiple forms of constraint and it induces regular effects of  power. Each society has its regime of truth. He says basically truth claims our power plays.

Now  what should Christians do when they hear that? I'll tell you what they should do according to the  Bible. The first thing they should do is not get their backup and say, wait a minute, there really  is absolute truth. They should repent. And here's why.

Long before Foucault, long before Nietzsche,  long before Marx, Jesus said this, he says, woe to you Pharisees because you love the most important  seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces. Woe to you because you load people down  with burdens they can hardly bear but do not lift a finger to help them. What's he talking about? He's  talking about people who use the law of God, the truth, the Bible to get the place, the right places  in society, the high status, and to keep people down. That's exactly what Foucault and exactly  with Nietzsche.

Yes. See Jesus Christ years ago used the gospel to dismantle what Paul is talking  about and what so many people in the world who don't like Christianity complain about. If you get  your sense of worth and value out of the free grace of God, if the reason why you know  you're worth anything is just the free love and grace of God. Then the truth of God just becomes a  way of delighting him. It's something you love.

So if you get your sense of value from the grace  of God, you love the truth. But if you get your sense of value from being right,  if you get your sense of value and worth from having the truth and being accurate and being  value for the truth instead of God, you say you're looking to the truth to give you what only God  can give you. A sense that you must be a valuable important person because you know the truth so  well and so forth. See Jesus years ago called that moralism, Phariseism,  and dismantled it. And therefore Christians are in some ways standing on a very narrow piece of  ground.

In fact, to most of the roads invisible because over here you have people who basically say  who's to say what truth is? What is truth? You know everybody has to decide what truth is for him  or herself. They either deny the fact that there is truth or they play fast and loose with the  truth. And on the other side you've got people who say yes there is truth and here's absolute  truth and they beat people up with it and Jesus says Paul says both of those are rotten.

And if you're a person of integrity you don't do either. And a person who uses the truth  to beat people up is not really valid for the truth, you're valid for yourself. And you know the  non-Christian thinkers out there see it and know it. So there are the two problems. You know the one hand we're afraid we're afraid to be truthful.

You know what's you know what's  hard about about telling truth all the time. You know what's hard about keeping promises and  making promises. You know what's hard about integrity. It's scary. You know it's scary.

I mean if I  tell the truth all the time if I just let everybody up but then you know we're afraid and that's  why we lie. That's why I have always lied. When I lie I lie because I'm afraid. But on another hand you have pride. You know smart Luther said that the Christians are like a drunk  man who having fallen off of the horse on the one side promptly gets up on the horse and falls  off on the other.

And so we are now stuck between I would cook I would have to say two cultures. Listen to me. On the one hand we really do have a problem. We have a culture that is  relativistic. It really is.

They do say who's to say what is truth. Nobody can say what is right  wrong. All truth and morality is culturally relative. Now one of the bad problems we have there  and it's almost a joke is then we get real upset. We tell kids there is no right or wrong.

You have  to decide yourself. There is no such thing as truth and then we get all upset when they get out  into society and they lie and they cheat. C.S. Lewis in his abolition of man puts it like this. We clamor for the very qualities we are rendering impossible.

We laugh at honor. You know we laugh  at the idea of honor and truth. We laugh at honor and are shocked to find traders in our midst. We castrate and bid the gildings be fruitful. And he's what he's saying there.

He says we tell kids  all truth and morality is culturally relative. Who's to say what is truth and then it says we clamor  for the very qualities we are rendering impossible. Look at all this corruption. Look at all these people  cheating. Look at all these people not being honest.

Truth is relative but why aren't you honest? We clamor for the very qualities we are rendering impossible. We laugh at honor and are shocked  to find traders in our midst. We castrate them and then we build the gildings be fruitful and develop  virtue and honesty and integrity and they can't. And so on the one hand we are living in a society  like that but therefore the danger is to react and become people who use unwholesome words.

People who use the truth not to build up and not to benefit. You know we attack not the problem  but the person when we use the truth. So we have the truth party. We have the truth and nobody  else. And we have the love party.

Ah this just accept everybody but here's the problem. Truth  without love is not really truth. It is a power grab and love without truth is not really love. It's  cowardice or intellectual laziness. Truth and love have to be together or they're not themselves.

Got that? That's what Paul is saying here. Love without truth isn't truth and truth without love. Truth that love isn't truth and love without truth isn't love. Unless they're together they're not  themselves.

So what are we going to do? Here's what we're going to do. In John chapter 18 I just  noticed this this week there's really two trials. Jesus first is dragged before the high priest  before they you know before his crucifixion he's dragged before the high priest and they  religious leaders and then the same chapters drag before pilot. Now when he's dragged before  the high priest you know what he says?

High testified to the truth and they smack him. But then when he gets in front of pilot he uses almost exactly the same words I testified to the truth. And you know what pilot says? What is truth? And then they kill him.

I want you to behold the  wonder of this. First of all I want you to behold the wonder of the integrity of Jesus. Jesus  Christ, what a man of integrity. Why? He's the same both places.

There's no pseudo about Jesus. He's the same in one place as another. Here's the moralists, right? The people that he has  the religious leaders that he has been denouncing as moralists. Here's the moralists.

He says the  same thing. Here's the relativists. What is truth says pilot and he's exactly the same. He's not  two different kinds of people and notice this. He's not only the same in both places but they both  hate him.

They both smack him. They both kill him. Why? Because here's what's so weird. The  relativists and the moralists both are about power.

The reason the relativists says who's to say  what truth is is to get power. The reason why the moralist says I have the truth is about power. But Jesus Christ is the exact opposite. He is standing on his integrity, absolute integrity. I  testify the truth.

He says the same and it gets him killed. Why? Because he's using the truth to  serve us. They're using the truth to get power over us. His integrity took him to the cross.

But why did he want to go to the cross? And here is the solution. May I ask you a question? Did Jesus Christ go to the cross for truth? Was that why he went?

To show that God's law cannot be broken. To show that God's holiness and  his righteousness has to be satisfied. Did Jesus Christ go to the cross for the sake of the truth? Or did Jesus Christ go to the cross for the sake of love so that we could be pardoned so we could  be forgiven in spite of our sins? So we could be embraced so we could be accepted.

Okay everybody. Did Jesus Christ go to the cross for truth or did Jesus Christ go to the cross for  love? And the answer is yes. The minute he died, the truth of God was infinitely satisfied because  he fulfilled all the requirements of the love God. But the minute Jesus died, the love of God  was infinitely satisfied because now he can embrace us and pardon us and forgive us and receive us  in spite of our sins.

The cross brought truth and love together. I know in the world and sometimes  in our lives it seems like they're at loggerheads. But if I tell the truth, I don't know if that's  loving or if I really, in other words they seem at loggerheads but on the cross they were not at  loggerheads and when the cross comes into the center of your life they won't be either. You know why? It keeps you from the fear that makes you a person who plays fast and loses the truth because  Jesus Christ loved you so much that he died for you, but it also keeps you from the pride that makes  you a person who might abuse with the truth because Jesus Christ had to die for you.

You're that  sinful. So the pride that leads you to abuse people with the truth is taken away by the cross. The fear that leads us to duck and dive and play with the truth is taken away. Our hearts are so  filled with love that here's what we can do. Verse 29, I know that the translation says you should  only do what will benefit those who listen but literally the Greek says you should only say that  which will give grace to those who listen.

When you get the grace from the cross of Jesus Christ  then you can speak the truth graciously and only then or you could put it one other way. Yeah,  as Mr. Incredible once said, I got time. We can do one, let me tell you one more thing. In the beginning, don't think about that too much.

In the beginning of history, it was a disaster. Adam and Eve, you know, Garden of Eden, what happens? Sin, serpent, you know the story. Everything's horrible, death, destruction, evil, everything's horrible except there's a glimmer of  hope. You know what it is?

It's a promise. Genesis 3, 15, God says, I promise that one descendant of  Eve is someday going to bruise the head of the serpent, destroy evil. I promise. Scroll forward  centuries later. God starts talking to Abram says, I'm going to say the world through your descendants  and one night Abram says, but how can I be sure?

And in Genesis 15, God shocks Abraham and he  shocks anybody who understands what he's doing in Genesis 15 when he appears and he passes between  the pieces of a dead animal and he says, I will save the world through one of your descendants  even if it means I have to die. A second promise. And then years later, Jesus Christ comes into  the world and he's a man of complete integrity, complete integrity. He always means what he says,  always says what he means, absolute integrity, but at the very end in the ultimate act of integrity,  he sets his face like a flint to go to Jerusalem and he goes to the cross, why? He's fulfilling his  promise.

He's fulfilling the promise of God. And everything's before him. Everything comes down. Everything opposes him. Hell itself comes down and he says, no, I've made a promise and he  goes to the cross and he dies for us.

You've been saved by the integrity of Jesus. You've been  saved by the promise keeping of Jesus Christ. That should humble us away from ever using truth  against people, but on the other hand, it convinces us there is a truth where we can't be  at all. And it destroys our fear of telling the truth and therefore, oh, friends, look at the  integrity of Jesus, look at what he did for you on the cross and become people of integrity. Let's pray.

Thank you, Father, for giving us this vision of Jesus Christ who kept all his promises. He was a man of integrity. He used the truth to save us, not to exploit us. Our Father, when we deny the truth or fail to speak the truth, to save our next,  or when we abuse people with the truth, to get the power and status we want, we are just  turning our eyes away from your Son. Who was the way the truth and the life,  but who on the cross gave us forever a vision of how truth and love are joined together.

They're one flesh, never to be parted, and we pray that the vision of what Jesus did on the cross  would enable the truth and love to grow in our own lives, go hand in hand. We pray you make us a  community of integrity. We pray that you'd help us to know how to speak the truth in our culture  right now that doesn't want to hear it. We pray, Lord, that you would help us to know what it  needs to be, people of integrity. We ask this in Jesus' name, amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today as Tim Keller explores one of the fruit of the Spirit. The reading for today is taken from the Book of Ephesians chapter 4 verses 14 and 15,  20 through 25 and verse 29. Then we will no longer be infants tossed back and forth by the waves  and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men  in their deceitful scheming. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up  into Him who is the head that is Christ. You, however, did not come to know Christ that way.

Surely you heard of Him and were taught in Him according with the truth that is in Jesus. You were taught with regard to your former way of life to put off your old self,  which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires, to be made new in the attitudes of your minds,  and to put on the new self created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness. Therefore, each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor,  for we are all members of one body. Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths,  but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs  that it may benefit those who will listen. This is the word of the Lord.

Galatians 5, verses 22 to 23, lists what's called the fruit of the Spirit. These are  characteristics, descriptors of a supernaturally changed heart, love, joy, peace, patience,  and we're looking at one each week so that perhaps we can have more of the supernatural change in our  own lives. Today we come to faithfulness. The word faithfulness is honesty, integrity, truthfulness,  and this is a great text that we're going to be looking at so we can take a deeper look at what  that means. There couldn't be a more relevant topic.

Because of the economic crisis, the recession,  and the revelations that have come out, since then, our trust, Americans trust of their  institutions, business, government, church, is that an all-time low, all the studies show that,  because there is a sense that there's been a failure of integrity in our society at all levels. And what does the Bible have to say about this, therefore, very relevant and all-important subject? This particular text is going to show us that there are two problems with regard to truth. There's  a problem of practicing truthfulness, but then there's also a problem of abusing people with  the truth. So there's a problem of practicing truth, and then there's a problem of abusing people  with the truth, and then we're going to see what the solution is, how we solve both problems.

Okay? First, first there's the problem of practicing truth. It's a very demanding thing,  according to the Bible, and what's great about this passage is there's three very important aspects  to being truthful people that are all mentioned. What does it mean to be truthful? First, it means  to refuse to deceive people, to not deceive people.

Notice verse 14 and 15, verse 15 says,  instead speak the truth, instead of what? And in verse 14 it says, cunning, craftiness, and deceit. Now, this is extremely important, because if you and I tend to think of lying strictly as conveying  inaccurate statements. But the Bible long ago understood what today is called speech act theory. You know what speech act theory is?

Speech act theory is the insight that every word is actually  also a deed. We tend to say word deed or two different things, but every word is really a deed. That is, every word is not only designed to convey information, it's also designed to get  something done. It's got an intention, it's got a purpose. And in order to evaluate a word,  or a phrase, you need to not only evaluate whether it's conveying fruit, accurate information,  but also evaluate what its purpose is.

So for example, there's been a theft at the office,  your office. And you know, Mr. A did it, but you want to protect and cover for Mr. A. So the  investigators come.

And you don't want to lie to them, see? And they say, who did it? What did you see? And you say, I saw Mr. B there that very night.

Is that a lie? Technically,  you're telling the per- you're saying what actually happened. It's factually true. Mr. B was there  that night.

You did see Mr. B there that night. But what's the purpose of this statement? It's misdirection. It's to hide.

It's to deceive. You're trying to get them to run down. You know,  you're throwing them a red herring. And therefore, what is, according to the Bible, an untruthful  word? An untruthful word is any word that deliberately tries to hide reality from the listener.

Every listener that asks you a question, if you lie to them, that means you are deliberately  withholding reality as you know it to be from them. And therefore, if you're deceiving, whether or  not what you said is technically true or not, that's a lie. And it's wrong. And as a result, by the  way, what that does mean is once you realize what the Bible is saying here, it does expand your  understanding. Does it not?

A untruthful speech? So somebody once made this little list, polite  lies, euphemisms, exaggerations, word inflation, and so-called benevolent lies. But they're all lies. So here's a polite lie. I would love to go, but I'll be out of town.

But you won't be out of town. Here's a euphemism. I think your writing is too sophisticated for our readers. When you mean  it's too terrible for our readers. But you don't want to say it's terrible.

You upset them. It's a  euphemism. It's a lie, see? Exaggeration. This works inside marriage.

You always, you never  went out, of course, that's not true because the person you are berating sometimes does  or sometimes does, but when you say you always, you never, what you're actually what speech act  theory here, you know, even if it's pretty much true, you're bludgeoning the person besides that  you're exaggerating. So the person's going to find the part of what you're saying that's wrong  and just going to inflame things. You're going to be up very late tonight. Or word inflation. And here's  something.

Now think about this, everybody. This is something that Christians do particularly,  but it can be done everywhere. Whenever public discourse in a church is, it was, it's such a blessing. The Lord was there. It was just incredible.

Now what happens is sometimes the Lord is there  and sometimes it is a blessing and sometimes it's incredible. When it's always a blessing,  it's always incredible. You're just creating cynicism, especially amongst your kids. Just creating cynicism. It's word inflation.

So what you're actually doing is it's not, it's  deceptive. It's just a way of always, it's hype. Hype is deceptive. Hype isn't reality. And then  you've got a whole pile of the little, what you call benevolent lies.

There's enabling  lives like when you continually lie for an incompetent friend, when you actually ought to be confronting  him or her about how they're living. Or then you have watergate lies. You know what watergate  lies are? Watergate lies are, well the little people wouldn't understand. It's just too complicated  for them.

So this is what I'm going to say. This is all deception. To live a life of truthfulness  means to refuse to deceive. Number one, number two. Secondly, to live a life of truthfulness  according to the Bible is to make and keep promises.

That actually comes out, though you might not  see it immediately, in verse 25. We should, if you're a Christian, you should tell the truth  everybody, of course. But in verse 25, it actually says, speak truthfully to your neighbor. Now that  might sound in that case like anybody, but then it says, for we are members of one body. And here  he's talking about Christian to Christian.

And that members of one body is a covenant image. A covenant is an agreement. A covenant is a commitment. A covenant is a public commitment you  enter into by signing a contract or making a promise. And here we're told the Christians are people  who are not afraid of.

They make and they keep promises. We live in a culture in which there is  so much emphasis on personal freedom, personal freedom, keeping your options open, that people no  longer make promises at places that they used to. And if they do make them, they feel very, very  free to break them as soon as it entails any self-denial at all. Let me just give you two examples  and I'll immediately backpile. Two examples of places where people used to make promises, but now  they don't make promises.

One is living together without being married. Secondly, being very involved  in the church without joining. In both cases, you're not making the promise that you used it. Now right  away, somebody is going to say, are you equating those two things? I am not equating them.

I'm not  saying they're equally wrong or bad. What I'm saying is 40 years ago, neither of them happened  very much. And the reason they didn't happen very much was because the idea of making a promise and  nailing it down and committing yourself in a sense, committing yourself and shutting down your  options wasn't considered the horrible thing that it is today, but it is. And so it permeates us  all. And one of the problems is that we actually think, one of the reasons is we're so big on  our freedom that we feel like if I make promises and I make commitments and I stick with them,  that somehow I lose my freedom and that is not true at all.

Lewis Meads, in his great book,  Mayor Morality, which is an exhibition of the Ten Commandments, talks about this at one place. He's talking about making promises and keeping commitments and taking vows. And he's thinking,  you can hear when he talks about it, he's thinking somewhat about the marriage vow, but he's actually  what he's saying in this quote, is true of all promises and all commitments. He says this,  when we make a promise, we take it on ourselves to create a future with someone else, no matter  what fate or destiny may have in store. This is almost ultimate freedom.

When I make a promise,  I bear witness that my future with you is not determined by the hand I was dealt out of my  family's genetic deck. When I make a promise, I testify that I was not routed along some  unalterable itinerary by the psychic conditioning visited on me by my slightly wacky parents. I am not faded, I am not determined, I am not a lump of human dough whipped into shape by the  contingent reinforcement and averse of conditioning in my past. Now I know as well as the next person  that much of what I am and what I do is a gift or a curse from my past, but when I make a promise to  anyone, I rise above all the conditioning that limits me, no German shepherd ever promised  to be there with me, no computer ever promised to be loyal for life, only a person can make a promise  and when he does, he is most free. You see, when you say, but if I make that promise, if I make that  commitment, if I promise to be there, then I won't have my freedom, and what he's saying is the  opposite, don't you realize that if you don't make a promise, then you are a slave to circumstances,  you're a slave to feelings, you're a slave to fears, you're a slave to impulses, make a promise.

And that's your way of saying, this is the way I'm going to be and I don't care about whatever else  happens, and that makes you more free. And to be people of integrity, we should be people who are  not afraid of making promises and keeping promises. So refusing to deceive, making keeping promises  and the third aspect of what it means to practice the truth and be truthful is integrity of selves,  plural, integrity of selves. Look at verse 25, where it says, therefore each of you must put off  falsehood. But you know what it says in the original Greek is, you must put off the pseudo.

That's the Greek word, the pseudo. And this is what he is talking about. Think of the word integrity. In English, it's the same as the word integer. What is an integer?

It's a whole number,  not a fraction, something that can't be divided. It's a whole number. What is integrity? A person  of integrity has the same self in every place. You don't have a pseudo self in a real self.

So for example, a person who lacks integrity is one way in private and another way in public. This is the reason why politicians should be really careful about those live microphones. You're one way in private and another way in public. Without integrity, you are one way with this  group and a total another way with this group. You talk a completely different line than this,  what you say, what you say you believe, it's totally different.

A person of integrity, however,  is the same in private as in public. The same with this group as with that group. The same in what  you think with what you say and the same with what you say with what you do. You don't have multiple  selves, a real self and a bunch of pseudo selves. You've got one self, one real self.

And boys is lacking. If I had time, I would talk about all the cultural reasons why  we're actually encouraged by the culture to create totally different selves. What do you think? What do you think all those internet names are? You create totally different selves.

We're encouraged  by it. But let me just give you one example of how devastating it is in just one area, which I  mentioned at the top, which is business. A man who was some years ago just writing a book on  how to have integrity as a business leader just wrote these things. Now, I just pulled them off  because they're routine, but they also are very revealing. He says, don't say publicly where for quality,  but privately you have unreasonable deadlines and all your employees know it.

Don't take friends to company box seats when everybody knows you should only be bringing clients  there. Don't say publicly everything is fine when all your employees know everything is not fine. Don't give huge perks to management and not to others. Don't put in a big number of orders  right before the end of the quarter because even though you know they will all be cancelled,  it will look so good in the figures for the quarter. When you hear that kind of thing,  you suddenly realize, oh my word, we just swim in that.

I'm back to the illustration. Don't ask a fish  to tell you about water because then the fish will say, well, what's water? Because the fish is so  in the water, the fish doesn't even see the earth's water. And maybe we're getting to the  place where we can't even say to people in business, in government, in the church, in real life,  just life, be people of integrity because they don't even know what that is because they're so used  to the kind of behavior that this man said, don't do, don't do, but we just swim in it. It's just everywhere.

All through this passage, the reason why we should be truthful comes back to God. Does it not? We should be righteous and truthful and holy because God is truthful and righteous and holy. And the implication of that, if you're a Christian believer, is astonishing. There's a place  in the Sermon on the Mount.

When you read through the Sermon on the Mount, a lot of this stuff makes  sense. When you get to this place, it doesn't seem to make sense. It's about oaths. And there's a place  where Jesus says, don't swear by the city of Jerusalem and don't swear by your head, but let your  yes be yes, and let your no be no. And you say, what?

And here's what he meant by that. In those days, it was understood or believed that if you swore by God, the name of God,  then you couldn't ever break your oath. That probably goes to their understanding of the 10  commandments, which says, you must not take the name of the Lord that God invades, which means  you must never take the name of God on and then not follow through. If you invoke God's name,  then you better follow through. But they said, if you swear on something else, if you swear on  your father's grave, or if you swear on the city of Jerusalem, or if you swear on your own head,  that's different.

If you make a promise like that, it's not so bad if you break it. And you know what  Jesus is saying, don't you dare believe that. He says, don't you understand? Jerusalem is God's  city. Your head is God's, God made your head.

Your father's grave is God's. He says, don't you realize  that every yes and every no, everything you say every day, every idle word is under oath,  as much under oath as if you were because you are standing before the throne of the great king. Absolutely, there's no levels of truthfulness. Absolutely, everything you say is actually under oath. If I told you that tomorrow somebody's going to follow you around and it's going to video,  every single thing you do and every single thing you say, would you speak with more integrity?

Would you be more careful? How you spoke to your spouse or to your friends or to the person  that you're pitching a deal to, a prospective client, would you be at all more careful? If you knew it was being recorded and then tomorrow it was going to be put up on the internet,  would you be more careful? I would and you would. And if we're Christians, we're fools.

Because it's true that we would be more careful. And yet Jesus Christ says, don't you realize you're  you're under way more scrutiny than that. Every single one of your words is being held a far greater  accountability than a few thousand people watching it on the internet. God, the God of truth, the God  of righteousness, the God of holiness, you're standing right before Him. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God.

Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face  every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365-day devotional, the Songs of Jesus,  you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a regular  devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start. And if you already spend time in study  and prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest emotions and  questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with Him.

So you see the problem and the difficulty of practicing the truth, but that's not the only problem  that Paul brings out here. It's not the only problem with regard to the truth. There's a second problem  and it's fascinating to me.

He hints at it in verse 15. When he doesn't just say,  instead speak the truth in love. He doesn't just say speak the truth. He says speak the truth in love. Doesn't just say speak the truth.

He says in love. Okay, well that's nice. When you look at that,  you kind of think, okay, so be truthful but add love. So truth is one thing and love is another  thing. But when you get down to verse 29, the last verse, then you see how remarkable what a  remarkable point Paul is making because he says, do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your  mouth.

That word unwholesome literally means rotten. It's a word that means putrefying. It's a word  that means leading to decay and disintegration. Okay. And then so what is an unwholesome word?

An  unwholesome word is anything that is not supposed, is not designed to build up, not designed to benefit. And you say, what does that mean? The true words that are not designed to build up and benefit  the person. Even true words are rotten. And the answer is yes, that's what Paul is saying.

Rotten. So what are unwholesome words? What does this mean? Well on the one hand, you know,  I still always am, I'm always amazed by the one place in Henry V in the play, the Shakespeare play  Henry V when he's just hung a man for, you know, he's, they're invading France and the  English are invading France and he hangs a man for pillaging, I think. And at one point, he turns  around and he actually says to all of his soldiers, he says, I will not have the French  upgraded nor abused in disdainful language.

Okay. Yeah, we're here to conquer them but we're not. We're not going to speak disdainfully. We're not going to abrade them. Now that clearly is what it  means, but I believe Paul is not just talking about abusive, you know, angry harsh tones, though  he certainly is saying that.

If you say the truth, in abusive, harsh, angry ways,  that's rotten, that stinks, that's wrong, that's sinful. What I'm telling the truth, it doesn't  matter and here's the reason why. When you tell the truth in abusive ways, when you beat people  up with the truth, are you really caring about the truth? Are you really valiant for the truth? No,  you're valiant for yourself.

But Paul's not only talking about, I think, overtly abusive  words. He is saying anything that's not actually designed to benefit and build up. That's amazing. When you tell the truth to somebody, is your goal? Here we are back to speech act theory.

Okay,  maybe what you're saying is true, technically true, doctrinally true, you know, accurate,  but are you trying to marginalize the person in the eyes of others? Are you trying to beat the  person up? Are you trying to punish them? Are you trying to put them in their place? Are you trying  to get applause from other people because you're being so hard on them?

Paul says none of those  are right. Anyone who uses the truth basically to beat the person up in order to get more power and  status for yourself is abusing the truth. And you're not valiant for the truth, you're valiant for  yourself. You're using the truth for your own power and status. And at this point, by the way,  you realize that we're coming to a place where we're coming to one of the main objections  that the world out there today, especially in our culture, has about the church.

Foucault, Nietzsche, those kinds of people, have said now for years that when Christians claim  to have the truth, they're really basically just using the truth to get on top. So Foucault is a famous place where the French philosopher Foucault says truth is a thing of this  world. It is produced by virtue of multiple forms of constraint and it induces regular effects of  power. Each society has its regime of truth. He says basically truth claims our power plays.

Now  what should Christians do when they hear that? I'll tell you what they should do according to the  Bible. The first thing they should do is not get their backup and say, wait a minute, there really  is absolute truth. They should repent. And here's why.

Long before Foucault, long before Nietzsche,  long before Marx, Jesus said this, he says, woe to you Pharisees because you love the most important  seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces. Woe to you because you load people down  with burdens they can hardly bear but do not lift a finger to help them. What's he talking about? He's  talking about people who use the law of God, the truth, the Bible to get the place, the right places  in society, the high status, and to keep people down. That's exactly what Foucault and exactly  with Nietzsche.

Yes. See Jesus Christ years ago used the gospel to dismantle what Paul is talking  about and what so many people in the world who don't like Christianity complain about. If you get  your sense of worth and value out of the free grace of God, if the reason why you know  you're worth anything is just the free love and grace of God. Then the truth of God just becomes a  way of delighting him. It's something you love.

So if you get your sense of value from the grace  of God, you love the truth. But if you get your sense of value from being right,  if you get your sense of value and worth from having the truth and being accurate and being  value for the truth instead of God, you say you're looking to the truth to give you what only God  can give you. A sense that you must be a valuable important person because you know the truth so  well and so forth. See Jesus years ago called that moralism, Phariseism,  and dismantled it. And therefore Christians are in some ways standing on a very narrow piece of  ground.

In fact, to most of the roads invisible because over here you have people who basically say  who's to say what truth is? What is truth? You know everybody has to decide what truth is for him  or herself. They either deny the fact that there is truth or they play fast and loose with the  truth. And on the other side you've got people who say yes there is truth and here's absolute  truth and they beat people up with it and Jesus says Paul says both of those are rotten.

And if you're a person of integrity you don't do either. And a person who uses the truth  to beat people up is not really valid for the truth, you're valid for yourself. And you know the  non-Christian thinkers out there see it and know it. So there are the two problems. You know the one hand we're afraid we're afraid to be truthful.

You know what's you know what's  hard about about telling truth all the time. You know what's hard about keeping promises and  making promises. You know what's hard about integrity. It's scary. You know it's scary.

I mean if I  tell the truth all the time if I just let everybody up but then you know we're afraid and that's  why we lie. That's why I have always lied. When I lie I lie because I'm afraid. But on another hand you have pride. You know smart Luther said that the Christians are like a drunk  man who having fallen off of the horse on the one side promptly gets up on the horse and falls  off on the other.

And so we are now stuck between I would cook I would have to say two cultures. Listen to me. On the one hand we really do have a problem. We have a culture that is  relativistic. It really is.

They do say who's to say what is truth. Nobody can say what is right  wrong. All truth and morality is culturally relative. Now one of the bad problems we have there  and it's almost a joke is then we get real upset. We tell kids there is no right or wrong.

You have  to decide yourself. There is no such thing as truth and then we get all upset when they get out  into society and they lie and they cheat. C.S. Lewis in his abolition of man puts it like this. We clamor for the very qualities we are rendering impossible.

We laugh at honor. You know we laugh  at the idea of honor and truth. We laugh at honor and are shocked to find traders in our midst. We castrate and bid the gildings be fruitful. And he's what he's saying there.

He says we tell kids  all truth and morality is culturally relative. Who's to say what is truth and then it says we clamor  for the very qualities we are rendering impossible. Look at all this corruption. Look at all these people  cheating. Look at all these people not being honest.

Truth is relative but why aren't you honest? We clamor for the very qualities we are rendering impossible. We laugh at honor and are shocked  to find traders in our midst. We castrate them and then we build the gildings be fruitful and develop  virtue and honesty and integrity and they can't. And so on the one hand we are living in a society  like that but therefore the danger is to react and become people who use unwholesome words.

People who use the truth not to build up and not to benefit. You know we attack not the problem  but the person when we use the truth. So we have the truth party. We have the truth and nobody  else. And we have the love party.

Ah this just accept everybody but here's the problem. Truth  without love is not really truth. It is a power grab and love without truth is not really love. It's  cowardice or intellectual laziness. Truth and love have to be together or they're not themselves.

Got that? That's what Paul is saying here. Love without truth isn't truth and truth without love. Truth that love isn't truth and love without truth isn't love. Unless they're together they're not  themselves.

So what are we going to do? Here's what we're going to do. In John chapter 18 I just  noticed this this week there's really two trials. Jesus first is dragged before the high priest  before they you know before his crucifixion he's dragged before the high priest and they  religious leaders and then the same chapters drag before pilot. Now when he's dragged before  the high priest you know what he says?

High testified to the truth and they smack him. But then when he gets in front of pilot he uses almost exactly the same words I testified to the truth. And you know what pilot says? What is truth? And then they kill him.

I want you to behold the  wonder of this. First of all I want you to behold the wonder of the integrity of Jesus. Jesus  Christ, what a man of integrity. Why? He's the same both places.

There's no pseudo about Jesus. He's the same in one place as another. Here's the moralists, right? The people that he has  the religious leaders that he has been denouncing as moralists. Here's the moralists.

He says the  same thing. Here's the relativists. What is truth says pilot and he's exactly the same. He's not  two different kinds of people and notice this. He's not only the same in both places but they both  hate him.

They both smack him. They both kill him. Why? Because here's what's so weird. The  relativists and the moralists both are about power.

The reason the relativists says who's to say  what truth is is to get power. The reason why the moralist says I have the truth is about power. But Jesus Christ is the exact opposite. He is standing on his integrity, absolute integrity. I  testify the truth.

He says the same and it gets him killed. Why? Because he's using the truth to  serve us. They're using the truth to get power over us. His integrity took him to the cross.

But why did he want to go to the cross? And here is the solution. May I ask you a question? Did Jesus Christ go to the cross for truth? Was that why he went?

To show that God's law cannot be broken. To show that God's holiness and  his righteousness has to be satisfied. Did Jesus Christ go to the cross for the sake of the truth? Or did Jesus Christ go to the cross for the sake of love so that we could be pardoned so we could  be forgiven in spite of our sins? So we could be embraced so we could be accepted.

Okay everybody. Did Jesus Christ go to the cross for truth or did Jesus Christ go to the cross for  love? And the answer is yes. The minute he died, the truth of God was infinitely satisfied because  he fulfilled all the requirements of the love God. But the minute Jesus died, the love of God  was infinitely satisfied because now he can embrace us and pardon us and forgive us and receive us  in spite of our sins.

The cross brought truth and love together. I know in the world and sometimes  in our lives it seems like they're at loggerheads. But if I tell the truth, I don't know if that's  loving or if I really, in other words they seem at loggerheads but on the cross they were not at  loggerheads and when the cross comes into the center of your life they won't be either. You know why? It keeps you from the fear that makes you a person who plays fast and loses the truth because  Jesus Christ loved you so much that he died for you, but it also keeps you from the pride that makes  you a person who might abuse with the truth because Jesus Christ had to die for you.

You're that  sinful. So the pride that leads you to abuse people with the truth is taken away by the cross. The fear that leads us to duck and dive and play with the truth is taken away. Our hearts are so  filled with love that here's what we can do. Verse 29, I know that the translation says you should  only do what will benefit those who listen but literally the Greek says you should only say that  which will give grace to those who listen.

When you get the grace from the cross of Jesus Christ  then you can speak the truth graciously and only then or you could put it one other way. Yeah,  as Mr. Incredible once said, I got time. We can do one, let me tell you one more thing. In the beginning, don't think about that too much.

In the beginning of history, it was a disaster. Adam and Eve, you know, Garden of Eden, what happens? Sin, serpent, you know the story. Everything's horrible, death, destruction, evil, everything's horrible except there's a glimmer of  hope. You know what it is?

It's a promise. Genesis 3, 15, God says, I promise that one descendant of  Eve is someday going to bruise the head of the serpent, destroy evil. I promise. Scroll forward  centuries later. God starts talking to Abram says, I'm going to say the world through your descendants  and one night Abram says, but how can I be sure?

And in Genesis 15, God shocks Abraham and he  shocks anybody who understands what he's doing in Genesis 15 when he appears and he passes between  the pieces of a dead animal and he says, I will save the world through one of your descendants  even if it means I have to die. A second promise. And then years later, Jesus Christ comes into  the world and he's a man of complete integrity, complete integrity. He always means what he says,  always says what he means, absolute integrity, but at the very end in the ultimate act of integrity,  he sets his face like a flint to go to Jerusalem and he goes to the cross, why? He's fulfilling his  promise.

He's fulfilling the promise of God. And everything's before him. Everything comes down. Everything opposes him. Hell itself comes down and he says, no, I've made a promise and he  goes to the cross and he dies for us.

You've been saved by the integrity of Jesus. You've been  saved by the promise keeping of Jesus Christ. That should humble us away from ever using truth  against people, but on the other hand, it convinces us there is a truth where we can't be  at all. And it destroys our fear of telling the truth and therefore, oh, friends, look at the  integrity of Jesus, look at what he did for you on the cross and become people of integrity. Let's pray.

Thank you, Father, for giving us this vision of Jesus Christ who kept all his promises. He was a man of integrity. He used the truth to save us, not to exploit us. Our Father, when we deny the truth or fail to speak the truth, to save our next,  or when we abuse people with the truth, to get the power and status we want, we are just  turning our eyes away from your Son. Who was the way the truth and the life,  but who on the cross gave us forever a vision of how truth and love are joined together.

They're one flesh, never to be parted, and we pray that the vision of what Jesus did on the cross  would enable the truth and love to grow in our own lives, go hand in hand. We pray you make us a  community of integrity. We pray that you'd help us to know how to speak the truth in our culture  right now that doesn't want to hear it. We pray, Lord, that you would help us to know what it  needs to be, people of integrity. We ask this in Jesus' name, amen.

### 引言：诚信的困境

当马克·吐温还是个男孩时，有一天他走在街上，看到一辆装满西瓜的车。他喜欢西瓜，于是悄悄靠近，偷了一个，跑到小巷里咬了一口。然而刚咬下去，一种奇怪的感觉涌上心头。他毫不犹豫地走回车边，放回了那个西瓜——然后**偷了一个熟的**。

这个故事讲起来容易接受，比起偷情或偷钱，偷西瓜似乎无伤大雅。但这恰恰说明了问题：我们对诚信的标准有多低，我们多容易让一些"小谎言"轻易滑过。

### 第一部分：诚信的反面是不诚实

诗篇15篇描述了一个正直的人：说真话、行公义、不受贿、即使吃亏也守约。

#### 1. 不要撒谎

耶稣在登山宝训中说："你们不可起誓……你们的话，是，就说是；不是，就说不是。"

什么意思？有些人认为只有在起誓时才必须说实话，平时可以打折扣。耶稣说：**不存在"真话的等级"**。你说的每一句"是"或"不是"，在神看来都是誓言。

马太福音12章说，我们要为每一句闲话交账。

想象一下，如果明天你的每句话都被录像，然后通过卫星向二十亿人播放，这会影响你明天说话的方式吗？当然会。但耶稣告诉我们：**你的实际处境比这更严重**，因为神在看着，祂的审判比二十亿人的意见重要得多。

#### 2. 不要违约

第4节说："他发了誓，虽然自己吃亏，也不更改。"

**什么是承诺？** 切斯特顿说，承诺是你与未来的自己定的约会。

当你承诺"我会爱你"，你是在说："我拒绝被我的基因、脑化学、社会或历史推来推去。无论发生什么，五年后我都会在那里。"

承诺带来自由，违约带来奴役。

托马斯·莫尔快要被烧死时，他的女儿恳求他收回承诺保命。莫尔说："梅格，当一个人起誓时，他把自己握在手中，就像握着水一样。如果他张开手指，就不要指望再找回自己了。"

### 第二部分：诚信的赝品是虚伪

诗篇15篇第2节不只说这人"说真话"，而是说他"**从心里说真话**"。

"诚信"（integrity）这个词和"整数"（integer）是同一个词根。整数是完整的数，不是分数。一个有诚信的人是**表里如一**的人。

虚伪（hypocrisy）在希腊语中是"演员"的意思。虚伪的人就是在演戏——外表一套，内心另一套。

我在南方牧会时，走进一个房间，人们在说："你知道是什么让这个国家伟大吗？工会！没有工会我们还在种稻子呢！"然后走进另一个房间，人们在说："你知道是什么在毁掉这个国家吗？工会！"

他们都问我："牧师，你说是不是？"我怎么回答的？我说："嗯，有道理……"

你看，我不是一个有诚信的人。

### 第三部分：如何培养诚信

诗篇15篇末尾说："行这些事的人，必永不动摇。"  
诗篇16篇中间说："我将耶和华常摆在我面前……我便不致动摇。"

**要过完全诚信的生活，必须将神常摆在你面前。**

#### 1. 认识到你需要神

谎言从哪里开始？从伊甸园开始。当亚当夏娃决定自己做主，不再完全依靠神，他们就与现实脱节了，**不得不开始躲藏**。这就是一切不诚实的根源。

为什么你那么难承认自己错了？  
为什么你总是要说服自己是某个人物？  
为什么你那么难听取批评？  
为什么你总是把问题怪到别人头上？

所有这些不诚实，都来自于**不愿承认我们需要神，不愿承认我们完全依靠祂**。

耶稣讲过一个比喻：两个儿子被叫去干活，一个说"我去"却没去，另一个说"我不去"却在最后时刻改变主意去了。哪个是顺服的？

法利赛人说是第二个。耶稣说："所以我告诉你们，税吏和娼妓倒比你们先进神的国。"

为什么？因为法利赛人不愿承认自己的软弱和罪。而**承认自己的不诚实，是诚实的开始**。

#### 2. 在耶稣里找到神

耶稣对彼拉多说："我就是真理。凡属真理的人就听我的话。"

知道真理是一回事，拥有真理是一回事，努力行真理是一回事——但**怎样才能让真理流淌在你的血管里**？

只有当你爱耶稣基督，祂的生命进入你、渗透你，只有当你活得好像神时刻在你面前，你才能过诚信的生活。

当你向祂敞开心扉，祂就向你敞开心扉，然后你才能向别人敞开心扉。只有那时，你才能过完全诚信的生活。

### 结语

你知道那意味着什么吗？  
意味着真诚到如此地步，简单到如此地步，你的心像一潭清澈的湖水，别人可以看到底。  
意味着你是一个有点严肃但又非常平易近人的人。  
人们可能会因为你的诚实而有点怕你，但他们会想和你打交道，因为他们知道你说话算话，因为他们知道你基本上是有爱心、公平的。

你是这样的人吗？

去找祂。向祂敞开心扉。将祂常摆在你面前，你就必永不动摇。
