Welcome to the Gospel Unliked Podcast. Many of the questions we face in life are complex and aren't always answered by simply  following rules. Do I speak up now or do I wait? Should I take that job or say where I am? That's why wisdom is so crucial.

But how do we develop it? Today join us as Tim Keller explores how we apply God's wisdom to the everyday complexities  of our lives.

This scripture reading is from Proverbs chapter 3 verses 1 through 8 and 11 through 12. My son, do not forget my teaching, but keep my commands in your heart, for they will  prolong your life many years and bring you peace and prosperity. Love, let love and faithfulness never leave you, bind them around your neck, write them  on the tablet of your heart. Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and man. Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding in all your  ways submit to him and he will make your path straight.

Not be wise in your own eyes, fear the Lord and shun evil. This will bring health to your body and nourishment to your bones. My son, do not despise the Lord's discipline and do not resent his rebuke because the Lord's  discipline, because the Lord disciplines those he loves. As a father, the son, he delights in, this is God's word. So we're going to short series on the early chapters of the book of Proverbs.

We're just doing three weeks here right after Labor Day and Proverbs is about wisdom. We live in a culture in which there's more choices than there ever have been and we  also live in a city in which there's an enormous number of choices. What you need in order to make good choices is wisdom. This, of course, moral values, moral goodness is important. On the other hand, wisdom is knowing what the right thing is to do in the 80% of life  situations that the moral rules don't directly apply to.

So for example, you might have two careers to take and both of them are morally acceptable. One of them fits you and one of them doesn't and if you make the wrong choice, you could  waste an enormous amount of your own time in a lot of other people's time too. If you make a bad choice because you're out of touch with reality, out of touch with reality  of what the job really entails, out of touch with reality with who you really are, it's  a huge difficulty and you could take years to get your life back on track even though you're  morally good, even though you're a good person, right? Even though there was nothing wrong morally in what the decision you made, but you can  be incredibly moral, incredibly good, incredibly knowledgeable, and still make pretty stupid  choices. So question, what is wisdom, we looked at this last week in chapter one of Proverbs, wisdom  is competence with regard to the realities of life.

Competence with regard to the realities of life, how life really works, well how do you  get wisdom? That's what we're here for tonight because here in chapter three is very well-known chapter. We learn where wisdom develops, the vehicle through which wisdom develops, and the catalyst  that sparks them all and fuels them all. So there's a place where wisdom occurs, where you learn it, there's vehicles through which  you learn it, and then there's a catalyst for those vehicles. Let's take a look at that.

First of all, brief but important is where does wisdom actually happen? It doesn't happen in a classroom, it doesn't happen in a seminar, I could give you a seminar  with the Bible says about wisdom, but I would just be telling what I'm about to tell  you now, and that is you can't get wise in a seminar, where does it happen? There's a metaphor all through the book of Proverbs, actually all through the Bible, but  all through the book of Proverbs. You see it in verse six, it says, do this, do this, do this, and he will make your path  straight. No, that's not that hard to understand as a metaphor, what does that mean?

God will make your path straight, that means he'll make your life go well. Your life is being likened to a pathway, and therefore living your life is being likened  to walking a path. Now, that metaphor says a lot. First of all, think about this, walking a path means doing something very, very steadily,  something very simple. If you jump, if you summer salt, even if you run, you won't get very far because everybody  can walk a lot farther you can run.

Even the greatest athletes can still walk further than they can run. The best way for you to make progress on the path is to do something very simple, very  rhythmic, called walking one foot after another foot, in front of another foot, and if you  walk on the path, it takes you somewhere you don't stay where you were. Why is this a metaphor for life? Here's what it means. So actions you take repeatedly, day after day, in your ordinary daily life make you something.

You can't stay the same. The way in which you behave, the actions, the choices you make in just ordinary daily  life is turning you into something. It's actually take turning you into a wise person or a foolish person, you know why? Because it's character that is forged in the small parts of daily life. Nobody brings this out better than C.S.

Lewis. C.S. Lewis says that every day when you make little decisions, you are putting a little  mark on your soul, a little twist on your soul. And slowly he says, it's through the little things you do, it's the pathway. It's just one foot after another foot after another foot.

The actions and choices you're making in your very ordinary daily life is either taking  you down to becoming a person like the angels or like the demons. So he gives an example in his book, Merry Christianity, in the chapter on forgiveness. Here's what he says. He says, imagine something. Imagine one day you read in the newspaper a story.

And it's about a party of people that you don't like. And the story is, oh there's going to be a big scandal that's about to break. These people have acted very, very badly, very scandalously and it's going to be a big  scandal and they're going to be thrown out of power. And you don't like them anyway. So what you do is you're reading this newspaper story and you're enjoying this.

You say, hey, I never liked these people's positions, I didn't like their politics  and so now it turns out that they're really nasty people. They're going to be turned out of office, that's great. Then Lewis says, what if a week later you read another story in the newspaper that says,  hey, that wasn't right. It turns out that the original report was not true or not so bad as it was made out. And Lewis says at that point, you've got a choice to make.

You may not even realize it. He says, on the one hand, you could say this. You could say, oh, thank goodness that person is not as bad as I thought he was. Or you can be very disappointed. And this is what he says.

He says, you can either decide, well, I guess I was wrong. The person is really a pretty good person. Or you can be disappointed. I wanted to think that person was that bad. Now here's what he says.

This is Lewis. He says, he says, if you go with the first feeling, then thankfully he's not so bad. That's one thing. But if you go with the second feeling, and he says the second feeling is a feeling of  disappointment, and the determination to hold on to the first story for the sheer pleasure  of thinking your enemy is bad as you would like them to be. He says, if you do that, I am afraid it's the first step in a process which, if followed  to the end, will make you into a devil.

You see, one is beginning to wish that black was just a little blacker than it really  is. And if we give that wish its head, later on, we shall wish to see gray as black, and eventually  you'll be able to see white as black, and finally, you'll be fixed forever in a universe  of pure hatred. Because remember, we Christians believe the soul lives forever. And so what really matters is a little Marx or twist on the central inside part of the  soul which are going to turn it in the long run into a heavenly or hellish creature. Do you hear what he's saying?

He says, when you don't like somebody, and then you hear that they're really, really  bad. Then you find out they're not so bad, and you say, I'm, and you basically, but I want  to think that they're that bad. So I'm going to believe that they're that bad. What have you done? Because of your resentment, because of your grumpiness and unhappiness, you are choosing  to believe something that's probably not true.

You want to believe that. And that means you're just a little more foolish than you were a minute ago. Because you're out of touch with reality. Think of these, think of three character qualities. There's humility or pride.

There's cowardice, I mean, there's a part of it should say courage or cowardice. There's grace and forgiveness or there's anger. Now, if you're angry and you're resentful, you want to believe a person is bad, even  if they're not. So what you're going to do is if you see something that confirms your prejudice, your belief,  you're going to grab to that. And if you see something that shows the person's not as bad as you think they are, you're  going to ignore it.

And what do you, you're out of touch with reality. You're creating a scenario in your mind of what the person is like that isn't true. And you're going to make bad choices because wisdom is competence with regard to the realities  of life. Wisdom is making choices on the basis of reality, not what you think is real, but what  is real. If you're a coward or if you're proud and you don't take anybody else's advice, you want  to think your opinion and your feelings are the right ones, don't you see?

Here's the first point. It's the little things you do every day that can either make you more resentful, more  cowardly, more proud, or more loving, more forgiving, more courageous. And the greater the, the stronger your character, the wiser you're going to be because the  more in touch with reality you are, do you get this point? In other words, in daily life, your little choices turn you, give you good character and  that good character is the basis for making the big choices wisely. Little choices give you the character on the basis of which you make the big choices wisely  because life is a path.

And it's an ordinary daily life that wisdom is lost or gained bit by bit by bit, one foot  after another foot, another foot, extremely gradually. Point two, all right, how can you set things up so that you are making those good choices  and you're moving down that path toward wisdom instead of foolishness. There's four things that the text tells us about. Four things that if you do, we'll enable you to make the choices in daily life that  develop the character, of humility and of courage and of graciousness and so on. It's the small choices that create the character on the basis of which you make the wise big  choices because you're in touch with reality.

How do you get that character? If in daily life you do four things, and here's what they are, I'll list them and then  go through them. Knowing God, this is how wisdom comes through knowing God, trusting God, submitting to  His Word and living in community. First of all, knowing God. Look at verse three, but love and faithfulness never leave you.

Bind them around your neck and write them on the tablet of your heart. Now, this is not an easy text to understand immediately because when we read it in English,  it looks like it's saying be a loving, faithful person, right, but love and faithfulness  never leave you. That's not exactly, you probably think be a loving and faithful person, but look at  the way it's talking about. What do you mean love and faithfulness never leave you, bind it around your neck, write  it on the tablet of your heart, don't let go of it, don't lose a grip on it. What does that mean?

And actually the word for love here and faithfulness are two Hebrew words that are words that  actually describe God's covenant love for His people. The word love there, by the way, is the Hebrew word case says, which actually means His  unconditional love for His people, His commitment, His faithfulness, His graciousness, that He's  unconditionally committed to you. So when it says, let God's love and faithfulness never leave you, hold them on, bind them around  your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart, talk about it all the time. Here's what it's saying. You need to be absolutely convinced of and never lose your grasp of His unconditional  gracious love for you or put it like this.

You need to know, know, know in your heart of heart of hearts that He's for you, that He  would do anything for you, that He has done anything for you, that He's unconditionally  committed to you. Why, why does that create wisdom to think about that? If you really had that deep, if you knew, knew, knew, your heart of heart of hearts, love  and faithfulness, His unconditional love, it would give you a poise that you would never  panic. You'd always make wise choices because you just would never be panicked, you'd never be  running scared. Well, how do you do that?

Binding them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart? Actually, there's a lot of things I'm sure you can do. But mainly, the very least it means having a prayer life. At the very least it means taking an abstract idea, making it real to your heart to prayer,  at least daily, maybe a couple of times a day, through, you have to at least have a very  vigorous life in which you are walking with God that you're praying and reading and talking  to Him that you're practicing His presence and reminding yourself of what He's done for  you. So, first of all, knowing God, daily knowing God, enables you to make the choices that  will turn you, push you toward wisdom and not foolishness.

Secondly, though, look at this, verse 5, trust in the Lord with all your heart. Now, I'm afraid when you hear that right away, you just start to feel inspired. Trust in the Lord with all your heart. It sounds like a hallmark reading card and, you know, oh, how nice. But it actually has got an edge to it.

It really has teeth to it. Because it is very possible to believe in God, to obey God, I mean, other to obey the  think commandments, to pray to God and not trust, give the functional trust of your heart  to something else. It's possible to believe in God, but to trust something else for your real significance,  for your real security. So for example, you believe in God, you go to church, you obey the think commandments,  you pray, but is your career? The real functional trust of your heart.

Is that really the way you get yourself a steam? You really get your sense of value and worth. Is it what you really, really get your sense that I'm safe in this world? Come on, be honest. Very often, you won't admit it until something goes wrong with it.

But when something goes wrong with it, here's the problem. Anything you make, the functional trust of your heart, whether it's your beauty, your  intelligence, your talent, your career, your wealth, family, some romantic relationship,  your spouse, anything you make, your functional trust, there is always anordinate emotions around  those things. That is to say, if something goes wrong with your career, you're going to be sad. It's awful. It's terrible.

But if it's your trust, you will be devastated, you will be emotionally debilitated,  you won't be able to function. There's these enormous emotions around things that are your functional trust rather than  God. And it clouds your judgment. It makes you unable to actually be wise. So knowing God, trusting God, okay, thirdly, and lean not on your own understanding in  all your ways submit to Him.

Now, I said thirdly, the way for you to develop wisdom is through submitting to God's word. Now, it doesn't say Bible there, it doesn't say scripture, it doesn't say that at all. And yet it says that even though you may have this opinion, you may have this belief,  you may have this understanding of things, you need to follow God's understanding and submit  to Him and His will, not your own. Now, how does that happen? The background of the whole book of Proverbs is the Torah, the law of God.

In fact, most commentators on the book of Proverbs say, Proverbs is nothing but the law of  God, the Torah, being applied to daily life. And so, it's immersing yourself in the Word of God, that's the way, instead of leaning  on your understanding, instead of doing your own will, you lean on His understanding. Now, how does immersing yourself in the Bible, just plunging yourself in,  learning it, mastering it, listening to it, reading it, studying it? How does that turn you actually into somebody who's wise? There's a nice simple way and there's a more complex way, okay?

Now, here's the simple way. There are a lot of just plain rules in the Bible, moral categories,  categorical moral statements. So, for example, what if you're married, and marriage isn't going very well,  and you have an opportunity for an extramarital fair,  an actual offer is on the table from someone, and you're wrestling, do I want to do that? I don't, can I handle that? You know, what should I do this?

You know, and you're wrestling, we'll see another Bible can really help you with this decision. Now, here you are wrestling, you're taking all this time,  maybe you're working through decision making matrices and things like that,  and the Bible says, no, no, never, you're married, you made a promise,  while you're married, no. So, it's very simple, I know, there's plenty, the Bible says, you don't have to pray about it. You don't have to sit around, you don't have to think it out,  you don't, and there's a lot of things the Bible says. As I said, you know, 20, 25% of your life decisions, the Bible's got some nice,  clear, you know, tracks to run on, and so in some ways, you know, you might,  now listen, we don't always like what the Bible says, so here you are in this marriage,  but I don't understand, lean not on your own understanding.

Say, maybe you don't like it, or maybe you find it difficult to understand, but there it is,  and so how do you let God's understanding trump yours? How do you do that? So that you become wiser as time goes on, then you would be otherwise,  it's one way is through submitting to the Word of God. That's the simple way, but there's a more complex way, I do need to tell you about this. The more complex way is important.

Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer? Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith? For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding  of what it means to follow Christ. A great resource to start using this summer is the new city catechism devotional,  God's truth for our hearts and minds. This devotional brings the historic catechisms of the Christian Church to life,  offering a question to consider for each week of the year.

In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catechises,  the rich and communal practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers  that frame the foundational beliefs of the Christian faith. Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer, and a brief meditation  that will challenge and inspire you. The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper,  Tim Keller, and Kevin D. Young, as well as historical figures such as Augustine,  John Calvin, and Martin Luther. This month, in addition to the new city catechism devotional,  we're including a great companion resource,  the new city catechism for kids,  as our thank you for your gift to help gospel and life share the hope of Christ's love  with people all over the world.

So, request your copies today at gospelonlife.com slash give. That's gospelonlife.com slash give. Now, here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. Alistair McIntyre in his book, After Virtue,  and he's a, Alistair McIntyre is a Catholic philosopher,  wrote a book called After Virtue. And in the book, he gives an illustration.

It's very famous. It's rightly so. And the illustration goes like this. Imagine that you're standing at a bus stop  and a young man you've never met in your life. You don't know him.

A young man walks up to you and says,  Hey, the Latin name of the common wild duck  is histrionicus, histrionicus, histrionicus, and then he walks away. Okay, so. All right. How do you make sense of that? Why did that happen?

It happened. How do you make sense of that? Now, McIntyre's point is there's only one way to make sense of it. And that is you have to put it in a narrative. You have to, you have to say, what is the story  in which this incident makes sense?

And it can't make any sense unless you stick it into a story. Now, he says, there's three, he suggests three possible stories. There's probably more. He says, the first story is actually very likely  in a pretty sad story and a sad story is  that the man is mentally ill or mentally deranged or traumatized or something  so that there's some that he's mentally not right. It's a very sad story and he, well, that would make sense.

It would not and of course it would make sense of it and it would be sympathy for him. And so that's one story that would make sense of it. He says, here's a second story and that is it's mistaken identity. That maybe several days ago when he was in the library, he was trying to look this book up and  find it about the Commonwealth Duck and he talked to the librarian and you look like the librarian. And so, you know, they was dark in there and now he's out here at the bus stop.

And he thinks you're the librarian so he walks up because you look like that person somewhat  and says, hey, you know what, I did find the book. Okay, that's a little bit less likely but it's possible. Now he says, here's the third story by the way that McIntyre says,  well, their story is this man is a spy  and he is mistaken you for his contact and he's giving you the code. Now that's not as likely but well, it could be. Now here's McIntyre's point, what happened makes no sense unless you stick it into a narrative  and the narrative you put it in completely determines how you respond to it.

Now, yeah, obviously you're going to respond in very different ways depending on whether the  person's, you know, a mental patient, you know, or any of that sort of thing or a spy. Now let's think about something. Think of your money, the money you have. How do you look at it? How do you treat it?

How do you act toward it? What do you do with it? Do you realize it all depends on what you think the story of the world is? If you accept the secular idea that we're here by accident, when we die, we just rot. Eventually, when the sun dies, there'll be nobody around to remember anything that anyone's ever done.

In that situation, then all you have, the only happiness you'll ever have is the happiness  you can have right here, right here. So how are you going to treat your money? You'll treat it one way. But what if the story of the world is very different? What if we were all created by God so that absolutely everything that we have is a gift from him?

And what if the world is fallen, but God has come into redeeming it and someday he's going  to renew it and there's going to be an afterlife? What if this life is not the only life? What if this life is actually a relatively small part of your entire life? Your entire life on earth is only a small part of your entire existence. Now in that story, not only your money looks different, obviously everything looks different.

It all depends on what story you put it in. And when people come to me and say things like, how much money, as a Christian,  how much money should I give away? So God is pleased because I really don't want to give one cent more way than I need to. So what you're doing is you're looking for a rule like thou shalt not commit adultery. You're saying thou must give 12.3 percent of your income away to the poor.

So you're looking for a rule. But what if the Bible gives us a story that's so different than the world's story  that it's going to make you generous? It's going to make you far, far, far more generous. See, when you then read not just the rules of the Bible, but the narratives and the history  and everything, everything in the Bible, as you read it and you immerse yourself in it,  every part of your life looks different. And therefore, how you live is different and the wisdom grows out of that.

And it's not as simple as what's the rule about how much I have to give away. The more you immerse yourself in the word of God, the more you become wise. You see that? Because everything looks different in the story that the Bible tells us about the world. And there's one more thing that one more vehicle that you need in order to develop wisdom and  daily life.

And that is community. It says here in verse 7,  do not be wise in your own eyes. Do not be wise in your own eyes. Now, the definition of a fool is a person who's wise in his or her own eyes. The definition of a fool is someone who only cares to see things from their own perspective.

Now, I'm in this room and I can see some things from this perspective that none of the rest of you  can because I have this unique perspective. But many of you can see things around you that I can't  see very well because I'm old. And you're far away and you're closer. And therefore, to really know what's happening in this room would take all of our perspectives. Is that not right?

Now, the definition of a fool is someone who only sees things from his or her  own eyes. I don't care what anybody else thinks. I see it the way I see it. The definition of wisdom is to see things through as many other eyes as possible. Through God's eyes, through the word of God, through your friend's eyes.

Because you have friends and you have other people. The definition of wisdom in the book of  Proverbs is a person who's created a company of counselors around them over the years. Mentors and counselors and friends and people that you always check with. We are an individualistic society. We are a place where we're taught, you make your own decision,  you make your own call.

You shouldn't be accountable to other people. You shouldn't have to have  you shouldn't let other people weigh in on what is your life. Yeah, it's your life. Yes, but you  can't see it. You can't see it.

You can't see yourself. Do you know what you really look like? You  don't know. Every time you look at a mirror, you're looking at something else. You're not really  looking at yourself.

It's the reason why so often when you actually see a picture of yourself,  you say, oh, or, or if you actually listen to recording of yourself, you say, who is that awful  person? I don't sound like that, do I? Because you don't. You're inside here and you hear yourself  through the bones in years or something like that. When you actually hear your voice, you sound  off.

You say, I don't sound like that. Do I? And all your friends say, yes, that's you. See, their eyes see better. And only if you are deeply involved in community,  are you going to be wise, and in the Word, and in trusting God, and in knowing God.

But not done, not quite. Because actually, in this text we're told, there's a catalyst,  a kind of spark that makes all the vehicles run turbocharged. There is something that when it happens  it makes all these things produce wisdom at 10 times the normal rate. Do you know what that is? Well, it's kind of a shock when we get to it.

It says here in verse 11 and 12, my son  do not despise the Lord's discipline and do not resent his rebuke because the Lord disciplines  those he loves as a father, the son he delights in. Now, the image isn't hard to see. It's talking  about a father disciplining a son. Well, what is the father who's disciplining a son do? The father  brings into the son's life painful things, things that are hard, things that are difficult,  things that are painful, things that make the child cry usually.

What is that doing here? Okay, look, here's what's so surprising about this. Look at verses 1 and 2. Do this in this  peace and prosperity. Look at 3 and 4.

Do this in this favor in a good name is the result. Okay, look at 5 and 6. Do this in this straight pass. That's the result. And then 7 and 8.

Do this in this  health for your body, nourishment to your bones. So if you do this and you do this right,  if you do this right, you do this right, you do this right, you do this right, you do this right. Oh, by the way, even if you do everything right, horrible things are going to happen to you. That's what it's saying. It's completely unexpected.

You're going right along and suddenly,  hey, bad things are going to happen to you. And God's going to let them happen to you. Now, how do we respond? What does this mean? Well, at the most basic level, it is very basic wisdom.

You know why? At the most basic level, this chapter at least is saying that you can do everything  right and your life still go pretty bad. Everything right and your life still go pretty badly. You can do this right and this right be moral, be decent, you know, be charitable, be work hard,  submit to God, do all these things and still terrible things happen. And I want you to know  that at the, at the most basic level, if you don't believe that, if you don't know that,  you are not ready for life.

You are actually foolish because you're not in touch with reality. The reality is people who do live extremely good lives and have very smart and pretty much everything  right. You can still have terrible lives. Now, I'll tell you, I see a lot of young people who don't  want to believe that. When they see somebody's life blow up, they actually say they probably did  something wrong.

I'm not going to do that. That's very self-justifying. That's being wise in your  own eyes. And that's setting you up for incredible disappointment because if you believe that people  whose lives blow up have always done something wrong in order for that to happen, you don't know  how life works. You are not wise.

You are not competent with regard to the realities of life. So the very least is telling you, you can do everything right in your life, still blow up. But it's also telling you something else. This is a chapter on how to become wise. These are things that have to happen in order for you to become wise.

And what this is saying is, nobody ever gets wise without really bad things happening to them. Now, it's not just Christians who believe this. I mean, I do know that our modern Western  society does not see anything like this in suffering. It's just seen as a total disaster. But almost every other culture and every other religion has always understood this.

And that is  that if you don't suffer, you will not be wise. You'll be a shallow person. People who live  charm lives, people who've had almost everything go well, are shallow people. And virtually everybody  who is wise says, I learned the most through my failures, my mistakes, through bad things that  happened to me. Look, do you want to really know yourself?

Do you really want to know who you are,  your strengths and weaknesses? That only happens if you're tested. Do you want to be good at  helping hurting people, skillful and compassionate and helping hurting people? That's  only going to happen if you've been through it. Otherwise, you won't know what to do.

You'll be  clueless. You'll actually make things worse when you try to help. Do you want to be absolutely so  sure that you can trust God that he's there for you? So absolutely sure that nothing really rattles  you. I think that only happens.

Frankly, you don't really learn to trust God until you're drowning. You don't really come to see that Jesus is all you need until Jesus is all you have. But when you realize this and you say, okay, suffering, turbocharges everything else, it's not  until you suffer that you really end up knowing God in prayer, that you really end up trusting God  instead of the things that you used to trust, which have now blown up on you. It's only through  suffering that you really get into the Word of God. And then you really get into community.

We  are often just go off on our own. We're our own person and we really don't rely on other people  until what happens. What happens is suffering comes and then it comes and suddenly we need people,  which is we always did. In other words, suffering, turbocharges all the other things that move you  toward wisdom. But I think everybody does know that suffering doesn't necessarily do that.

Because as I said, the thing you need to be wise and make good choices is character. You need  to become humble, not proud. You need to become courageous, not cowardly. You need to become  gracious and forgiving, not angry and resentful. But the problem is suffering can make you a proud  person.

Haven't you seen that? Some sufferers become very arrogant because they feel like you  don't understand how I've suffered. They feel noble. They feel better than other people. Suffering can also, of course, make you a coward.

Say, you're so broken that they just won't face  anything. Suffering can make you incredibly bitter. In other words, when suffering happens,  it will be either pushing you down the path toward wisdom, toward greater humility and greater  dependence on God and greater, or it'll be pushing you toward foolishness. Why? What is the key?

How, listen, suffering is inevitable and it's either going to make you wiser or stupider. So how are you going to make sure it makes you wiser? Here's the key. The key is you have to  believe that God delights in you when it happens because the Lord disciplines those He loves as a  father's son. He delights it.

In real child discipline, if a father really loves his son,  and he's letting bad things come into the child's life as part of discipline,  he's not doing it to condemn the child. He's not doing to hurt the child. It hurts him to see  the child cry, but he's doing it to grow the child up. You have to be absolutely sure  that he loves you and delights in you when the bad things happen or the suffering will harden you. It'll make you despondent.

It'll make you turn from God. It'll make you turn away from life. It'll make you arrogant. You've got to believe that he delights in you if you're going to have  suffering soften you and make you wise rather than harden you and make you foolish. But how can you be sure?

How can anybody be sure? In the New Testament, these two verses,  11 and 12 are picked up and put down in Hebrews chapter 12. There it says, my son, do not make a light of the Lord's discipline. Don't lose heart when he rebukes you. The Lord disciplines those he loves and he punishes  everyone he delights in as a son.

But right near it is this. Let us fix our eyes on Jesus,  the author and perfect of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him,  endured the cross, scorned its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. And there it is. Think how can you be sure that you're a child of God that he delights in  when you're going through suffering? That's what you need.

Otherwise you won't become a wise person. How can you be sure if you see what Jesus did for you? You see, when Jesus Christ was baptized,  the Spirit came down on him, and there was a voice from heaven that said,  this is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased in whom I delight. But when he got to the cross, all through his life, whenever Jesus turned to God,  he always said, father, when his disciples said, how should we praise a our father? When he's in the garden of the assembly, he says,  father, always father, whenever he talks to God, except on the cross,  when he cries out, my God, my God.

Why doesn't he call him father there? Because Jesus at that point  is being expelled. He's being rejected. He's getting what we deserved so that when we believe in him,  our sins can be forgiven. He took the potential we deserve so that we believe in him,  our sins are forgiven.

And it says in John chapter 1, 12, for those who received him, who believed  on his name, he gave authority to become children of God, were adopted, were brought in. That is losing his sonship so we can become children of God. He's losing that so that it says in Romans chapter 8 verse 16,  the Spirit bears witness with our spirit that we're children of God. What does that mean? It means because Jesus died on the cross and took our punishment.

We can know now that he is  pleased with us. And sometimes the Spirit comes in and says, you are my beloved child in him. I'm  well pleased. That will re-narrate your world. That will re-narrate it.

That story you put anything  in that. And it'll turn to gold. See, how can you know, no, no, in your heart of heart,  of hearts that he loves you only because he went to the cross? How can I trust God in suffering  if he's never suffered? But he has.

We're the only religion on the face of the earth that says God  is suffered. And if he suffered, he suffered like that, then I can trust him in the suffering. I can know he delights in me. Otherwise, he wouldn't have gone to the cross. And therefore,  when you rest in Jesus and see what he did for you, you are going to find that your  troubles relate to your heart the way fire relates to gold or the way pressure relates to diamond.

It'll just make you into something great. Let us pray. Our Father, we want to become wise. No,  we want to become like Jesus in whom all the treasures of knowledge and wisdom are hid. And therefore, we pray that you would help us to look to what Jesus did on the cross for us.

And therefore, seeing that proof that you delighted us, go through the ups and downs of life,  knowing you, trusting in you, submitting to your word, and living with our Christian brothers  and sisters, and getting in the community, and becoming more and more conformed to the image of  your Son and his name we pray. Amen.

This scripture reading is from Proverbs chapter 3 verses 1 through 8 and 11 through 12. My son, do not forget my teaching, but keep my commands in your heart, for they will  prolong your life many years and bring you peace and prosperity. Love, let love and faithfulness never leave you, bind them around your neck, write them  on the tablet of your heart. Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and man. Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding in all your  ways submit to him and he will make your path straight.

Not be wise in your own eyes, fear the Lord and shun evil. This will bring health to your body and nourishment to your bones. My son, do not despise the Lord's discipline and do not resent his rebuke because the Lord's  discipline, because the Lord disciplines those he loves. As a father, the son, he delights in, this is God's word. So we're going to short series on the early chapters of the book of Proverbs.

We're just doing three weeks here right after Labor Day and Proverbs is about wisdom. We live in a culture in which there's more choices than there ever have been and we  also live in a city in which there's an enormous number of choices. What you need in order to make good choices is wisdom. This, of course, moral values, moral goodness is important. On the other hand, wisdom is knowing what the right thing is to do in the 80% of life  situations that the moral rules don't directly apply to.

So for example, you might have two careers to take and both of them are morally acceptable. One of them fits you and one of them doesn't and if you make the wrong choice, you could  waste an enormous amount of your own time in a lot of other people's time too. If you make a bad choice because you're out of touch with reality, out of touch with reality  of what the job really entails, out of touch with reality with who you really are, it's  a huge difficulty and you could take years to get your life back on track even though you're  morally good, even though you're a good person, right? Even though there was nothing wrong morally in what the decision you made, but you can  be incredibly moral, incredibly good, incredibly knowledgeable, and still make pretty stupid  choices. So question, what is wisdom, we looked at this last week in chapter one of Proverbs, wisdom  is competence with regard to the realities of life.

Competence with regard to the realities of life, how life really works, well how do you  get wisdom? That's what we're here for tonight because here in chapter three is very well-known chapter. We learn where wisdom develops, the vehicle through which wisdom develops, and the catalyst  that sparks them all and fuels them all. So there's a place where wisdom occurs, where you learn it, there's vehicles through which  you learn it, and then there's a catalyst for those vehicles. Let's take a look at that.

First of all, brief but important is where does wisdom actually happen? It doesn't happen in a classroom, it doesn't happen in a seminar, I could give you a seminar  with the Bible says about wisdom, but I would just be telling what I'm about to tell  you now, and that is you can't get wise in a seminar, where does it happen? There's a metaphor all through the book of Proverbs, actually all through the Bible, but  all through the book of Proverbs. You see it in verse six, it says, do this, do this, do this, and he will make your path  straight. No, that's not that hard to understand as a metaphor, what does that mean?

God will make your path straight, that means he'll make your life go well. Your life is being likened to a pathway, and therefore living your life is being likened  to walking a path. Now, that metaphor says a lot. First of all, think about this, walking a path means doing something very, very steadily,  something very simple. If you jump, if you summer salt, even if you run, you won't get very far because everybody  can walk a lot farther you can run.

Even the greatest athletes can still walk further than they can run. The best way for you to make progress on the path is to do something very simple, very  rhythmic, called walking one foot after another foot, in front of another foot, and if you  walk on the path, it takes you somewhere you don't stay where you were. Why is this a metaphor for life? Here's what it means. So actions you take repeatedly, day after day, in your ordinary daily life make you something.

You can't stay the same. The way in which you behave, the actions, the choices you make in just ordinary daily  life is turning you into something. It's actually take turning you into a wise person or a foolish person, you know why? Because it's character that is forged in the small parts of daily life. Nobody brings this out better than C.S.

Lewis. C.S. Lewis says that every day when you make little decisions, you are putting a little  mark on your soul, a little twist on your soul. And slowly he says, it's through the little things you do, it's the pathway. It's just one foot after another foot after another foot.

The actions and choices you're making in your very ordinary daily life is either taking  you down to becoming a person like the angels or like the demons. So he gives an example in his book, Merry Christianity, in the chapter on forgiveness. Here's what he says. He says, imagine something. Imagine one day you read in the newspaper a story.

And it's about a party of people that you don't like. And the story is, oh there's going to be a big scandal that's about to break. These people have acted very, very badly, very scandalously and it's going to be a big  scandal and they're going to be thrown out of power. And you don't like them anyway. So what you do is you're reading this newspaper story and you're enjoying this.

You say, hey, I never liked these people's positions, I didn't like their politics  and so now it turns out that they're really nasty people. They're going to be turned out of office, that's great. Then Lewis says, what if a week later you read another story in the newspaper that says,  hey, that wasn't right. It turns out that the original report was not true or not so bad as it was made out. And Lewis says at that point, you've got a choice to make.

You may not even realize it. He says, on the one hand, you could say this. You could say, oh, thank goodness that person is not as bad as I thought he was. Or you can be very disappointed. And this is what he says.

He says, you can either decide, well, I guess I was wrong. The person is really a pretty good person. Or you can be disappointed. I wanted to think that person was that bad. Now here's what he says.

This is Lewis. He says, he says, if you go with the first feeling, then thankfully he's not so bad. That's one thing. But if you go with the second feeling, and he says the second feeling is a feeling of  disappointment, and the determination to hold on to the first story for the sheer pleasure  of thinking your enemy is bad as you would like them to be. He says, if you do that, I am afraid it's the first step in a process which, if followed  to the end, will make you into a devil.

You see, one is beginning to wish that black was just a little blacker than it really  is. And if we give that wish its head, later on, we shall wish to see gray as black, and eventually  you'll be able to see white as black, and finally, you'll be fixed forever in a universe  of pure hatred. Because remember, we Christians believe the soul lives forever. And so what really matters is a little Marx or twist on the central inside part of the  soul which are going to turn it in the long run into a heavenly or hellish creature. Do you hear what he's saying?

He says, when you don't like somebody, and then you hear that they're really, really  bad. Then you find out they're not so bad, and you say, I'm, and you basically, but I want  to think that they're that bad. So I'm going to believe that they're that bad. What have you done? Because of your resentment, because of your grumpiness and unhappiness, you are choosing  to believe something that's probably not true.

You want to believe that. And that means you're just a little more foolish than you were a minute ago. Because you're out of touch with reality. Think of these, think of three character qualities. There's humility or pride.

There's cowardice, I mean, there's a part of it should say courage or cowardice. There's grace and forgiveness or there's anger. Now, if you're angry and you're resentful, you want to believe a person is bad, even  if they're not. So what you're going to do is if you see something that confirms your prejudice, your belief,  you're going to grab to that. And if you see something that shows the person's not as bad as you think they are, you're  going to ignore it.

And what do you, you're out of touch with reality. You're creating a scenario in your mind of what the person is like that isn't true. And you're going to make bad choices because wisdom is competence with regard to the realities  of life. Wisdom is making choices on the basis of reality, not what you think is real, but what  is real. If you're a coward or if you're proud and you don't take anybody else's advice, you want  to think your opinion and your feelings are the right ones, don't you see?

Here's the first point. It's the little things you do every day that can either make you more resentful, more  cowardly, more proud, or more loving, more forgiving, more courageous. And the greater the, the stronger your character, the wiser you're going to be because the  more in touch with reality you are, do you get this point? In other words, in daily life, your little choices turn you, give you good character and  that good character is the basis for making the big choices wisely. Little choices give you the character on the basis of which you make the big choices wisely  because life is a path.

And it's an ordinary daily life that wisdom is lost or gained bit by bit by bit, one foot  after another foot, another foot, extremely gradually. Point two, all right, how can you set things up so that you are making those good choices  and you're moving down that path toward wisdom instead of foolishness. There's four things that the text tells us about. Four things that if you do, we'll enable you to make the choices in daily life that  develop the character, of humility and of courage and of graciousness and so on. It's the small choices that create the character on the basis of which you make the wise big  choices because you're in touch with reality.

How do you get that character? If in daily life you do four things, and here's what they are, I'll list them and then  go through them. Knowing God, this is how wisdom comes through knowing God, trusting God, submitting to  His Word and living in community. First of all, knowing God. Look at verse three, but love and faithfulness never leave you.

Bind them around your neck and write them on the tablet of your heart. Now, this is not an easy text to understand immediately because when we read it in English,  it looks like it's saying be a loving, faithful person, right, but love and faithfulness  never leave you. That's not exactly, you probably think be a loving and faithful person, but look at  the way it's talking about. What do you mean love and faithfulness never leave you, bind it around your neck, write  it on the tablet of your heart, don't let go of it, don't lose a grip on it. What does that mean?

And actually the word for love here and faithfulness are two Hebrew words that are words that  actually describe God's covenant love for His people. The word love there, by the way, is the Hebrew word case says, which actually means His  unconditional love for His people, His commitment, His faithfulness, His graciousness, that He's  unconditionally committed to you. So when it says, let God's love and faithfulness never leave you, hold them on, bind them around  your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart, talk about it all the time. Here's what it's saying. You need to be absolutely convinced of and never lose your grasp of His unconditional  gracious love for you or put it like this.

You need to know, know, know in your heart of heart of hearts that He's for you, that He  would do anything for you, that He has done anything for you, that He's unconditionally  committed to you. Why, why does that create wisdom to think about that? If you really had that deep, if you knew, knew, knew, your heart of heart of hearts, love  and faithfulness, His unconditional love, it would give you a poise that you would never  panic. You'd always make wise choices because you just would never be panicked, you'd never be  running scared. Well, how do you do that?

Binding them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart? Actually, there's a lot of things I'm sure you can do. But mainly, the very least it means having a prayer life. At the very least it means taking an abstract idea, making it real to your heart to prayer,  at least daily, maybe a couple of times a day, through, you have to at least have a very  vigorous life in which you are walking with God that you're praying and reading and talking  to Him that you're practicing His presence and reminding yourself of what He's done for  you. So, first of all, knowing God, daily knowing God, enables you to make the choices that  will turn you, push you toward wisdom and not foolishness.

Secondly, though, look at this, verse 5, trust in the Lord with all your heart. Now, I'm afraid when you hear that right away, you just start to feel inspired. Trust in the Lord with all your heart. It sounds like a hallmark reading card and, you know, oh, how nice. But it actually has got an edge to it.

It really has teeth to it. Because it is very possible to believe in God, to obey God, I mean, other to obey the  think commandments, to pray to God and not trust, give the functional trust of your heart  to something else. It's possible to believe in God, but to trust something else for your real significance,  for your real security. So for example, you believe in God, you go to church, you obey the think commandments,  you pray, but is your career? The real functional trust of your heart.

Is that really the way you get yourself a steam? You really get your sense of value and worth. Is it what you really, really get your sense that I'm safe in this world? Come on, be honest. Very often, you won't admit it until something goes wrong with it.

But when something goes wrong with it, here's the problem. Anything you make, the functional trust of your heart, whether it's your beauty, your  intelligence, your talent, your career, your wealth, family, some romantic relationship,  your spouse, anything you make, your functional trust, there is always anordinate emotions around  those things. That is to say, if something goes wrong with your career, you're going to be sad. It's awful. It's terrible.

But if it's your trust, you will be devastated, you will be emotionally debilitated,  you won't be able to function. There's these enormous emotions around things that are your functional trust rather than  God. And it clouds your judgment. It makes you unable to actually be wise. So knowing God, trusting God, okay, thirdly, and lean not on your own understanding in  all your ways submit to Him.

Now, I said thirdly, the way for you to develop wisdom is through submitting to God's word. Now, it doesn't say Bible there, it doesn't say scripture, it doesn't say that at all. And yet it says that even though you may have this opinion, you may have this belief,  you may have this understanding of things, you need to follow God's understanding and submit  to Him and His will, not your own. Now, how does that happen? The background of the whole book of Proverbs is the Torah, the law of God.

In fact, most commentators on the book of Proverbs say, Proverbs is nothing but the law of  God, the Torah, being applied to daily life. And so, it's immersing yourself in the Word of God, that's the way, instead of leaning  on your understanding, instead of doing your own will, you lean on His understanding. Now, how does immersing yourself in the Bible, just plunging yourself in,  learning it, mastering it, listening to it, reading it, studying it? How does that turn you actually into somebody who's wise? There's a nice simple way and there's a more complex way, okay?

Now, here's the simple way. There are a lot of just plain rules in the Bible, moral categories,  categorical moral statements. So, for example, what if you're married, and marriage isn't going very well,  and you have an opportunity for an extramarital fair,  an actual offer is on the table from someone, and you're wrestling, do I want to do that? I don't, can I handle that? You know, what should I do this?

You know, and you're wrestling, we'll see another Bible can really help you with this decision. Now, here you are wrestling, you're taking all this time,  maybe you're working through decision making matrices and things like that,  and the Bible says, no, no, never, you're married, you made a promise,  while you're married, no. So, it's very simple, I know, there's plenty, the Bible says, you don't have to pray about it. You don't have to sit around, you don't have to think it out,  you don't, and there's a lot of things the Bible says. As I said, you know, 20, 25% of your life decisions, the Bible's got some nice,  clear, you know, tracks to run on, and so in some ways, you know, you might,  now listen, we don't always like what the Bible says, so here you are in this marriage,  but I don't understand, lean not on your own understanding.

Say, maybe you don't like it, or maybe you find it difficult to understand, but there it is,  and so how do you let God's understanding trump yours? How do you do that? So that you become wiser as time goes on, then you would be otherwise,  it's one way is through submitting to the Word of God. That's the simple way, but there's a more complex way, I do need to tell you about this. The more complex way is important.

Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer? Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith? For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding  of what it means to follow Christ. A great resource to start using this summer is the new city catechism devotional,  God's truth for our hearts and minds. This devotional brings the historic catechisms of the Christian Church to life,  offering a question to consider for each week of the year.

In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catechises,  the rich and communal practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers  that frame the foundational beliefs of the Christian faith. Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer, and a brief meditation  that will challenge and inspire you. The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper,  Tim Keller, and Kevin D. Young, as well as historical figures such as Augustine,  John Calvin, and Martin Luther. This month, in addition to the new city catechism devotional,  we're including a great companion resource,  the new city catechism for kids,  as our thank you for your gift to help gospel and life share the hope of Christ's love  with people all over the world.

So, request your copies today at gospelonlife.com slash give. That's gospelonlife.com slash give. Now, here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. Alistair McIntyre in his book, After Virtue,  and he's a, Alistair McIntyre is a Catholic philosopher,  wrote a book called After Virtue. And in the book, he gives an illustration.

It's very famous. It's rightly so. And the illustration goes like this. Imagine that you're standing at a bus stop  and a young man you've never met in your life. You don't know him.

A young man walks up to you and says,  Hey, the Latin name of the common wild duck  is histrionicus, histrionicus, histrionicus, and then he walks away. Okay, so. All right. How do you make sense of that? Why did that happen?

It happened. How do you make sense of that? Now, McIntyre's point is there's only one way to make sense of it. And that is you have to put it in a narrative. You have to, you have to say, what is the story  in which this incident makes sense?

And it can't make any sense unless you stick it into a story. Now, he says, there's three, he suggests three possible stories. There's probably more. He says, the first story is actually very likely  in a pretty sad story and a sad story is  that the man is mentally ill or mentally deranged or traumatized or something  so that there's some that he's mentally not right. It's a very sad story and he, well, that would make sense.

It would not and of course it would make sense of it and it would be sympathy for him. And so that's one story that would make sense of it. He says, here's a second story and that is it's mistaken identity. That maybe several days ago when he was in the library, he was trying to look this book up and  find it about the Commonwealth Duck and he talked to the librarian and you look like the librarian. And so, you know, they was dark in there and now he's out here at the bus stop.

And he thinks you're the librarian so he walks up because you look like that person somewhat  and says, hey, you know what, I did find the book. Okay, that's a little bit less likely but it's possible. Now he says, here's the third story by the way that McIntyre says,  well, their story is this man is a spy  and he is mistaken you for his contact and he's giving you the code. Now that's not as likely but well, it could be. Now here's McIntyre's point, what happened makes no sense unless you stick it into a narrative  and the narrative you put it in completely determines how you respond to it.

Now, yeah, obviously you're going to respond in very different ways depending on whether the  person's, you know, a mental patient, you know, or any of that sort of thing or a spy. Now let's think about something. Think of your money, the money you have. How do you look at it? How do you treat it?

How do you act toward it? What do you do with it? Do you realize it all depends on what you think the story of the world is? If you accept the secular idea that we're here by accident, when we die, we just rot. Eventually, when the sun dies, there'll be nobody around to remember anything that anyone's ever done.

In that situation, then all you have, the only happiness you'll ever have is the happiness  you can have right here, right here. So how are you going to treat your money? You'll treat it one way. But what if the story of the world is very different? What if we were all created by God so that absolutely everything that we have is a gift from him?

And what if the world is fallen, but God has come into redeeming it and someday he's going  to renew it and there's going to be an afterlife? What if this life is not the only life? What if this life is actually a relatively small part of your entire life? Your entire life on earth is only a small part of your entire existence. Now in that story, not only your money looks different, obviously everything looks different.

It all depends on what story you put it in. And when people come to me and say things like, how much money, as a Christian,  how much money should I give away? So God is pleased because I really don't want to give one cent more way than I need to. So what you're doing is you're looking for a rule like thou shalt not commit adultery. You're saying thou must give 12.3 percent of your income away to the poor.

So you're looking for a rule. But what if the Bible gives us a story that's so different than the world's story  that it's going to make you generous? It's going to make you far, far, far more generous. See, when you then read not just the rules of the Bible, but the narratives and the history  and everything, everything in the Bible, as you read it and you immerse yourself in it,  every part of your life looks different. And therefore, how you live is different and the wisdom grows out of that.

And it's not as simple as what's the rule about how much I have to give away. The more you immerse yourself in the word of God, the more you become wise. You see that? Because everything looks different in the story that the Bible tells us about the world. And there's one more thing that one more vehicle that you need in order to develop wisdom and  daily life.

And that is community. It says here in verse 7,  do not be wise in your own eyes. Do not be wise in your own eyes. Now, the definition of a fool is a person who's wise in his or her own eyes. The definition of a fool is someone who only cares to see things from their own perspective.

Now, I'm in this room and I can see some things from this perspective that none of the rest of you  can because I have this unique perspective. But many of you can see things around you that I can't  see very well because I'm old. And you're far away and you're closer. And therefore, to really know what's happening in this room would take all of our perspectives. Is that not right?

Now, the definition of a fool is someone who only sees things from his or her  own eyes. I don't care what anybody else thinks. I see it the way I see it. The definition of wisdom is to see things through as many other eyes as possible. Through God's eyes, through the word of God, through your friend's eyes.

Because you have friends and you have other people. The definition of wisdom in the book of  Proverbs is a person who's created a company of counselors around them over the years. Mentors and counselors and friends and people that you always check with. We are an individualistic society. We are a place where we're taught, you make your own decision,  you make your own call.

You shouldn't be accountable to other people. You shouldn't have to have  you shouldn't let other people weigh in on what is your life. Yeah, it's your life. Yes, but you  can't see it. You can't see it.

You can't see yourself. Do you know what you really look like? You  don't know. Every time you look at a mirror, you're looking at something else. You're not really  looking at yourself.

It's the reason why so often when you actually see a picture of yourself,  you say, oh, or, or if you actually listen to recording of yourself, you say, who is that awful  person? I don't sound like that, do I? Because you don't. You're inside here and you hear yourself  through the bones in years or something like that. When you actually hear your voice, you sound  off.

You say, I don't sound like that. Do I? And all your friends say, yes, that's you. See, their eyes see better. And only if you are deeply involved in community,  are you going to be wise, and in the Word, and in trusting God, and in knowing God.

But not done, not quite. Because actually, in this text we're told, there's a catalyst,  a kind of spark that makes all the vehicles run turbocharged. There is something that when it happens  it makes all these things produce wisdom at 10 times the normal rate. Do you know what that is? Well, it's kind of a shock when we get to it.

It says here in verse 11 and 12, my son  do not despise the Lord's discipline and do not resent his rebuke because the Lord disciplines  those he loves as a father, the son he delights in. Now, the image isn't hard to see. It's talking  about a father disciplining a son. Well, what is the father who's disciplining a son do? The father  brings into the son's life painful things, things that are hard, things that are difficult,  things that are painful, things that make the child cry usually.

What is that doing here? Okay, look, here's what's so surprising about this. Look at verses 1 and 2. Do this in this  peace and prosperity. Look at 3 and 4.

Do this in this favor in a good name is the result. Okay, look at 5 and 6. Do this in this straight pass. That's the result. And then 7 and 8.

Do this in this  health for your body, nourishment to your bones. So if you do this and you do this right,  if you do this right, you do this right, you do this right, you do this right, you do this right. Oh, by the way, even if you do everything right, horrible things are going to happen to you. That's what it's saying. It's completely unexpected.

You're going right along and suddenly,  hey, bad things are going to happen to you. And God's going to let them happen to you. Now, how do we respond? What does this mean? Well, at the most basic level, it is very basic wisdom.

You know why? At the most basic level, this chapter at least is saying that you can do everything  right and your life still go pretty bad. Everything right and your life still go pretty badly. You can do this right and this right be moral, be decent, you know, be charitable, be work hard,  submit to God, do all these things and still terrible things happen. And I want you to know  that at the, at the most basic level, if you don't believe that, if you don't know that,  you are not ready for life.

You are actually foolish because you're not in touch with reality. The reality is people who do live extremely good lives and have very smart and pretty much everything  right. You can still have terrible lives. Now, I'll tell you, I see a lot of young people who don't  want to believe that. When they see somebody's life blow up, they actually say they probably did  something wrong.

I'm not going to do that. That's very self-justifying. That's being wise in your  own eyes. And that's setting you up for incredible disappointment because if you believe that people  whose lives blow up have always done something wrong in order for that to happen, you don't know  how life works. You are not wise.

You are not competent with regard to the realities of life. So the very least is telling you, you can do everything right in your life, still blow up. But it's also telling you something else. This is a chapter on how to become wise. These are things that have to happen in order for you to become wise.

And what this is saying is, nobody ever gets wise without really bad things happening to them. Now, it's not just Christians who believe this. I mean, I do know that our modern Western  society does not see anything like this in suffering. It's just seen as a total disaster. But almost every other culture and every other religion has always understood this.

And that is  that if you don't suffer, you will not be wise. You'll be a shallow person. People who live  charm lives, people who've had almost everything go well, are shallow people. And virtually everybody  who is wise says, I learned the most through my failures, my mistakes, through bad things that  happened to me. Look, do you want to really know yourself?

Do you really want to know who you are,  your strengths and weaknesses? That only happens if you're tested. Do you want to be good at  helping hurting people, skillful and compassionate and helping hurting people? That's  only going to happen if you've been through it. Otherwise, you won't know what to do.

You'll be  clueless. You'll actually make things worse when you try to help. Do you want to be absolutely so  sure that you can trust God that he's there for you? So absolutely sure that nothing really rattles  you. I think that only happens.

Frankly, you don't really learn to trust God until you're drowning. You don't really come to see that Jesus is all you need until Jesus is all you have. But when you realize this and you say, okay, suffering, turbocharges everything else, it's not  until you suffer that you really end up knowing God in prayer, that you really end up trusting God  instead of the things that you used to trust, which have now blown up on you. It's only through  suffering that you really get into the Word of God. And then you really get into community.

We  are often just go off on our own. We're our own person and we really don't rely on other people  until what happens. What happens is suffering comes and then it comes and suddenly we need people,  which is we always did. In other words, suffering, turbocharges all the other things that move you  toward wisdom. But I think everybody does know that suffering doesn't necessarily do that.

Because as I said, the thing you need to be wise and make good choices is character. You need  to become humble, not proud. You need to become courageous, not cowardly. You need to become  gracious and forgiving, not angry and resentful. But the problem is suffering can make you a proud  person.

Haven't you seen that? Some sufferers become very arrogant because they feel like you  don't understand how I've suffered. They feel noble. They feel better than other people. Suffering can also, of course, make you a coward.

Say, you're so broken that they just won't face  anything. Suffering can make you incredibly bitter. In other words, when suffering happens,  it will be either pushing you down the path toward wisdom, toward greater humility and greater  dependence on God and greater, or it'll be pushing you toward foolishness. Why? What is the key?

How, listen, suffering is inevitable and it's either going to make you wiser or stupider. So how are you going to make sure it makes you wiser? Here's the key. The key is you have to  believe that God delights in you when it happens because the Lord disciplines those He loves as a  father's son. He delights it.

In real child discipline, if a father really loves his son,  and he's letting bad things come into the child's life as part of discipline,  he's not doing it to condemn the child. He's not doing to hurt the child. It hurts him to see  the child cry, but he's doing it to grow the child up. You have to be absolutely sure  that he loves you and delights in you when the bad things happen or the suffering will harden you. It'll make you despondent.

It'll make you turn from God. It'll make you turn away from life. It'll make you arrogant. You've got to believe that he delights in you if you're going to have  suffering soften you and make you wise rather than harden you and make you foolish. But how can you be sure?

How can anybody be sure? In the New Testament, these two verses,  11 and 12 are picked up and put down in Hebrews chapter 12. There it says, my son, do not make a light of the Lord's discipline. Don't lose heart when he rebukes you. The Lord disciplines those he loves and he punishes  everyone he delights in as a son.

But right near it is this. Let us fix our eyes on Jesus,  the author and perfect of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him,  endured the cross, scorned its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. And there it is. Think how can you be sure that you're a child of God that he delights in  when you're going through suffering? That's what you need.

Otherwise you won't become a wise person. How can you be sure if you see what Jesus did for you? You see, when Jesus Christ was baptized,  the Spirit came down on him, and there was a voice from heaven that said,  this is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased in whom I delight. But when he got to the cross, all through his life, whenever Jesus turned to God,  he always said, father, when his disciples said, how should we praise a our father? When he's in the garden of the assembly, he says,  father, always father, whenever he talks to God, except on the cross,  when he cries out, my God, my God.

Why doesn't he call him father there? Because Jesus at that point  is being expelled. He's being rejected. He's getting what we deserved so that when we believe in him,  our sins can be forgiven. He took the potential we deserve so that we believe in him,  our sins are forgiven.

And it says in John chapter 1, 12, for those who received him, who believed  on his name, he gave authority to become children of God, were adopted, were brought in. That is losing his sonship so we can become children of God. He's losing that so that it says in Romans chapter 8 verse 16,  the Spirit bears witness with our spirit that we're children of God. What does that mean? It means because Jesus died on the cross and took our punishment.

We can know now that he is  pleased with us. And sometimes the Spirit comes in and says, you are my beloved child in him. I'm  well pleased. That will re-narrate your world. That will re-narrate it.

That story you put anything  in that. And it'll turn to gold. See, how can you know, no, no, in your heart of heart,  of hearts that he loves you only because he went to the cross? How can I trust God in suffering  if he's never suffered? But he has.

We're the only religion on the face of the earth that says God  is suffered. And if he suffered, he suffered like that, then I can trust him in the suffering. I can know he delights in me. Otherwise, he wouldn't have gone to the cross. And therefore,  when you rest in Jesus and see what he did for you, you are going to find that your  troubles relate to your heart the way fire relates to gold or the way pressure relates to diamond.

It'll just make you into something great. Let us pray. Our Father, we want to become wise. No,  we want to become like Jesus in whom all the treasures of knowledge and wisdom are hid. And therefore, we pray that you would help us to look to what Jesus did on the cross for us.

And therefore, seeing that proof that you delighted us, go through the ups and downs of life,  knowing you, trusting in you, submitting to your word, and living with our Christian brothers  and sisters, and getting in the community, and becoming more and more conformed to the image of  your Son and his name we pray. Amen.

### 引言：智慧的重要性

欢迎来到《福音不受欢迎》播客。我们生活中面临的许多问题都很复杂，并不是简单地遵循规则就能解决的。我现在该发声还是等待？我应该接受那份工作还是留在原地？这就是为什么智慧如此重要。但我们如何培养智慧呢？今天，请加入我们，听听 Tim Keller 探讨如何将上帝的智慧应用于我们生活中的日常复杂性。

> "在您收听今天的教导时，我们邀请您访问 gospelunlife.com 并注册电子邮件更新。"

**智慧对于驾驭生活的复杂性至关重要。**

### 第一部分：智慧之路

#### 1. 智慧的本质

我们将进行一个关于箴言书早期章节的小系列。我们在劳动节后只进行三周，箴言是关于智慧的。我们生活在一个选择比以往任何时候都多的文化中，我们也生活在一个选择众多的城市中。为了做出好的选择，你需要智慧。

- 道德价值观很重要。
- 智慧是在道德规则不直接适用的 80% 的生活情境中知道正确的事情是什么。

#### 2. 道路的隐喻

在整个箴言书中，实际上在整个圣经中都有一个隐喻，但在整个箴言书中尤为明显。你在第六节中看到它，它说，做这个，做这个，做这个，他会使你的道路平直。这并不难理解作为一个隐喻，这是什么意思？上帝会使你的道路平直，这意味着他会让你的生活顺利。

> "你的生活被比作一条道路，因此生活被比作走一条路。"

**你每天反复采取的行动使你成为某种人。**

### 第二部分：培养智慧

#### 1. 认识上帝

首先，认识上帝。看看第三节，但爱和信实永不离开你。把它们系在你的脖子上，写在你心的石板上。现在，这不是一个容易立即理解的文本，因为当我们用英语阅读它时，它看起来像是在说成为一个有爱心、忠诚的人，对吧，但爱和信实永不离开你。

- 上帝的爱和信实至关重要。
- 你需要绝对确信并永远不要失去对他无条件恩典之爱的把握。

#### 2. 信靠上帝

其次，看这个，第五节，全心信靠耶和华。现在，我担心当你听到这个时，你会立即感到受到启发。全心信靠耶和华。听起来像是一张贺卡，你知道，哦，多好。但它实际上有一个锋利的边缘。

- 可能相信上帝，但信任其他东西来获得真正的意义和安全感。

### 第三部分：智慧的催化剂

#### 1. 苦难的角色

现在，这个形象并不难理解。它谈论的是父亲管教儿子。那么，管教儿子的父亲做什么？父亲在儿子的生活中带来痛苦的事情，困难的事情，痛苦的事情，通常让孩子哭泣的事情。

> "没有人能在没有经历真正糟糕的事情的情况下变得聪明。"

**苦难可以让你变得更聪明或更愚蠢。**

#### 2. 上帝喜悦的保证

你怎么能确定？任何人怎么能确定？在新约中，这两节经文，11 和 12 节被引用并放在希伯来书第 12 章中。那里说，我的儿子，不要轻看主的管教，也不要因他责备你而灰心。

- 耶稣的苦难确保了我们上帝的爱。
- 在苦难中信靠上帝对你的喜悦。

**让我们祷告。我们的父，我们想变得聪明。不，我们想变得像耶稣，在他里面隐藏着所有知识和智慧的宝藏。**

### 结论

因此，我们祈求您帮助我们看到耶稣在十字架上为我们所做的。因此，看到您对我们的喜悦的证明，经历生活的起伏，认识您，信靠您，顺服您的话语，与我们的基督徒弟兄姐妹生活在一起，进入社区，越来越多地被塑造成您儿子的形象，以他的名义我们祈祷。阿门。

## Chinese Transcript / 中文

欢迎收听“Gospel in Life”（福音与生活）播客。我们在生命中面对的许多问题都非常复杂，并不是简单遵守一些规则就能回答的。现在要不要开口说话？要不要等一等？我该接受那份工作还是留在原来的岗位？正因如此，智慧就显得格外重要。

但我们如何培养智慧呢？今天，请你与我们一同聆听提姆·凯勒的分享，看看我们如何将上帝的智慧运用到日常生活的各种复杂处境中。当你聆听今天的信息时，我们邀请你访问 gospelinlife.com，订阅电子邮件更新。当你订阅时，你会收到我们每季度发行的期刊，以及其他宝贵的、以福音为中心的资源。现在就访问 gospelinlife.com 订阅吧。

今日经文选自《箴言》第三章 1–8 节和 11–12 节：

“我儿，不要忘记我的法则，你心要谨守我的诫命；因为它必将长久的日子、生命的年数与平安加给你。不可使慈爱、诚实离开你，要系在你颈项上，刻在你心版上。这样，你必在神和世人眼前蒙恩宠，有美名。

你要专心仰赖耶和华，不可倚靠自己的聪明；在你一切所行的事上都要认定他，他必指引你的路。不可自以为有智慧，要敬畏耶和华，远离恶事；这便医治你的肚脐，滋润你的百骨。

我儿，你不可轻看耶和华的管教，也不可厌烦他的责备；因为耶和华所爱的，他必责备，正如父亲责备所喜爱的儿子。”这是上帝的话语。

我们要用一小组系列信息来讲《箴言》前几章。劳工节之后的这三周，我们会连续讲三篇，《箴言》所谈的是“智慧”。我们生活在一个选择比以往任何时代都多的文化环境中，也住在一个选择极其繁多的城市里。要做出好的选择，你需要的是“智慧”。当然，道德价值、道德良善很重要；但另一方面，智慧指的是：在生命中那 80% 无法直接靠“道德规则”解决的处境里，知道当下正确的事情是什么。

举例来说，你可能面前有两条职业道路，两条在道德上都完全可行，但其中一条真正适合你，另一条却不适合。如果你做错了选择，你可能会白白浪费大量自己的时间，也浪费很多别人的时间。如果你在做选择时与现实脱节——不了解工作本身的真实情况，也不了解自己真正是怎样的人——那就会带来非常大的困难；即便你在道德上很好、是个好人，你也可能要花好几年时间才能把人生从那个错误决定中调整回来。

换句话说，你可以在道德上非常好、非常善良、非常有知识，却仍然做出非常愚蠢的选择。

那么问题来了：什么是智慧？上周我们在《箴言》第一章已经谈过：智慧是“与生命现实相对应的熟练度”（competence with regard to the realities of life）。

是对生命现实的熟练掌握，是对“生活真正如何运作”的熟练掌握。那么，人如何得到智慧？这就是我们今晚要谈的内容。因为在第三章这段非常有名的经文中，我们看到：智慧形成的场所、智慧形成的载体（或渠道），以及激发与推动这一切的“催化剂”。

所以，首先有一个地方，是智慧产生、被学习的地方；其次，有一些载体，是你借着它们来学习智慧的途径；然后还有一个催化剂，让这些载体都动起来、燃烧起来。让我们来看看。

第一点，虽然很简短却至关重要：智慧究竟发生在什么地方？不是在课堂里，不是在讲习班中。即便我给你办一个关于“圣经论智慧”的研讨会，我讲到最后其实也只能告诉你这样一件事：你无法在研讨会里变得有智慧。那么智慧在哪里产生呢？

圣经中有一个贯穿始终的比喻，尤其是贯穿《箴言》的比喻。你在第 6 节里就看到：“在你一切所行的事上都要认定他，他必指引你的路。”

这并不是一个难以理解的比喻，“指引你的路”是什么意思？意思是：祂会让你的生命道路平直，让你的生命运行良好。你的生命被比作一条“道路”（path），因此，“活出你的人生”就被比作“在一条路上行走”。

这个比喻本身已经说了很多。首先，想一想：在路上行走意味着什么？意味着做一件非常非常稳定、简单的事。如果你总是跳跃、翻筋斗，甚至一路小跑，你反而走不了太远——因为任何人“走路”都能比“跑步”走更远的路。你要在一条路上真正前进，最好的方式就是做一件非常简单、有节奏的事：一步接着一步，一只脚迈到另一只脚前面。如果你一直这样走，这条路就会带你去一个新的地方，你不会停留在原地。

为什么这会成为“人生”的比喻？它的意思是：你每天重复所做的那些行动——在你平凡日常生活中不断做出的选择——正在把你变成某种人。你不可能保持不变。你在日常生活中的行为、选择，会把你塑造成某一种人：要么变成智慧人，要么变成愚昧人。为什么？因为品格就是在每日生活的小事中被锻造出来的。

没有人比 C.S. 路易斯更清楚地把这一点说出来。C.S. 路易斯说，每一天，当你做那些小小的决定时，你其实是在你的“灵魂”上刻下一道又一道小痕迹，给灵魂加上一点又一点的小扭曲。慢慢地，他说，正是通过这些小事——你走在那条路上，一步又一步——你内在的那个“中心”正在被一点点扭转，最终要么变成近似天使的样子，要么变成近似恶魔的样子。

他在《返璞归真》（Mere Christianity）中以“饶恕”为例来说明：

他说，想象一下：有一天你读到报纸上一则新闻。文章说，有一群你向来不喜欢的人，马上就会爆出一桩大丑闻——他们做了极其恶劣的事，很快就会东窗事发、被赶下台。而你本来就不喜欢这一群人。所以当你读到这则新闻时，你心里暗自高兴：

“嘿，我从来就不赞同这些人的立场、不赞同他们的政治观点，现在看来他们真的是坏人。太好了，他们要被踢出权力位置了！”

接着，路易斯说：再想象一个星期后，你又读到一则新闻，说：

“上次那则报道并不准确，事实没那么糟，或者被夸大了。”

就在这一刻，你有一个选择要做，虽然你可能根本没有意识到。你可以这样回应：

“哦，感谢主，这个人没有我想象的那么坏。”

或者，你也可以感到非常失望。路易斯说，你可以选择前者：“好吧，我错怪他了，其实他还挺好。”也可以选择后者：“真可惜，我本来多希望他那么坏。”

然后路易斯接着说，如果你选择第二种反应——一种失望的感觉，并且你决心抓住先前那则负面报道不放，只因为你享受“把仇敌想得尽可能糟糕”带来的快感——如果你走上那条路，他说，这是一个过程的第一步。如果你一直这样下去，最终会把你变成一个“魔鬼”。

他说：你开始希望“黑的可以再黑一点”。如果你任凭这个欲望发展下去，不久你就会把“灰色”也当作“黑色”；再过不久，你甚至会把“白色”当作“黑色”；最终，你会永远被困在一个完全由仇恨构成的宇宙里。

因为我们基督徒相信，灵魂是永远存在的。所以，真正重要的是，那些一点一滴印刻在灵魂最中心的“痕迹”与“扭曲”，长远来看，它们会把你变成一个天上的或地狱里的存在。

你听明白他在说什么了吗？当你不喜欢某个人，然后你听到一则坏消息，说他极其糟糕；后来又发现事实并没有那么糟，而你却心想：“我还是宁愿相信他那么坏。”你选择继续相信那件可能根本不是真实的事，只因为你心里有怨恨、有牢骚、有不满。那一刻，你就比一分钟前更加愚昧，因为你在逃避现实。

想一想这三组品格特质：谦卑 vs. 骄傲；勇气 vs. 怯懦；恩典与饶恕 vs. 愤怒与苦毒。如果你心里充满愤怒和怨恨，你就会“想要”相信那个人很坏，即便事实并非如此。所以，一旦看到一点点证据似乎支持你原本的偏见，你就会牢牢抓住；而当看到某些迹象表明那个人没那么坏时，你就选择视而不见。结果呢？你与事实脱节。你正在为那个人构造一个想象中的形象，而那个形象并不是真的。

而你会在这样的基础上做决定。智慧是“与生命现实相对应的熟练度”：智慧意味着在真实的现实基础上做决定——不是基于你“以为是真实”的东西，而是基于“真正真实”的东西。如果你是个胆小鬼，或者你骄傲到不肯听任何人的建议，你就一定想要相信“自己的意见和感觉才是对的”。看见了吗？

所以，第一个要点就是：在日常生活里，你做的那些细微小事，要么会让你更怨恨、更懦弱、更骄傲，要么会让你更有爱心、更肯饶恕、更有勇气。而品格越坚实，你就会越有智慧——因为你就越贴近现实。明白这一点了吗？

换句话说，在日常生活中，你所做的小选择，塑造了你的品格；而就是在这样被塑造出来的品格基础上，你才会在重大抉择上做出智慧或愚蠢的决定。生命是一条道路；正是在这条路上，一步接着一步、极其渐进地，智慧在日常生活里一点一点地被失去或获得。

第二点，那么，如何安排自己的生活，使你在日常的小选择中，是向智慧前进，而不是向愚昧滑落？经文告诉我们有四件事。如果你持续去做这四件事，就会帮助你做出那些“塑造品格”的日常选择，使你向智慧而不是愚昧前行。

这四件事是：认识上帝、信靠上帝、顺服祂的话语，以及活在群体中。

首先，认识上帝。看第三节：“不可使慈爱、诚实离开你，要系在你颈项上，刻在你心版上。”

这节经文不太容易立刻读懂，因为我们一看到中文，会以为它是在说：“要做一个有慈爱、有诚实的人。”——“不要让慈爱、诚实离开你”——好像在说：你要成为一个充满爱、满有信实的人。但你注意看它是怎么说的：“不可使慈爱、诚实离开你，要系在你颈项上，要刻在你心版上，不要放手，不要丢掉。”这是什么意思？

其实，这里的“慈爱”和“诚实”（或译“信实”），在希伯来文里，是专门用来描述神与祂子民“盟约之爱”的两个词。“慈爱”这个词是 chesed，指的是祂对祂子民无条件的爱、承诺、信实、恩典——祂无条件地向你承诺自己。因此，当经文说：“不可使慈爱、诚实离开你，要系在你颈项上，刻在你心版上”，意思是：你必须牢牢记住、绝对确信祂无条件的爱和信实；你必须抓住这一点，时时思想、不断默想。

换句话说，你必须在你内心最深处、在“心的心”的地方，牢牢知道：祂是站在你这边的，祂愿意为你做一切，祂已经为你做了一切，祂对你有绝对的承诺。

那为什么这样的认识会产生智慧呢？如果你真的在心里深深地抓住这一点——祂的慈爱与信实——它会给你一种“稳定感”，以致你不会慌乱。你不会被恐惧驱使做决定，因此你会做出智慧的抉择。你不会在恐慌中乱跑乱撞，而是能够冷静地做出判断。

那么，“把慈爱系在颈项上，刻在心版上”到底要怎么做？当然，有很多具体方式，但至少，它意味着你必须有一个真实的祷告生活。至少，它意味着你要把一个“抽象概念”透过祷告变成你心里真实的感受——每天如此，甚至每天不止一次。你需要一个有活力的灵修生活：与你的神同行，祷告、读经、对祂说话；你需要不断操练“活在祂面前”，不断提醒自己祂为你成就了什么。

所以第一点是：在日常生活中“认识上帝”，会帮助你在那些小选择上做出正确的决定，从而在道路上向智慧前进，而不是向愚昧滑落。

第二点，看第五节：“你要专心仰赖耶和华，不可倚靠自己的聪明。”

我担心的是，我们一听这句话，往往只会被“激励”的感觉包围：“要专心仰赖耶和华”——听起来就像贺卡上的金句，感觉很温馨。但这节经文其实非常有锋芒，里面有“牙齿”。

因为有一种情况非常常见：你可以“相信”有一位上帝，可以“遵守”十诫，可以“祷告”上帝——但你心里真正倚靠、真正给出“功能性信任”的，却是别的东西。

换句话说，你可以相信上帝、去教会、守规矩，但真正给你“自我价值感”和“安全感”的，是你的事业，是你的外貌，是你的才华，是你的财富，是你的家庭，是某段恋情，是你的配偶——这些东西，才是你心里真正倚靠的“功能性信仰”。

你怎么知道自己是不是这样？往往要等到这些东西出问题时，你才肯承认。当你的事业出问题时，你当然会难过，这是非常糟糕的事。但如果事业是你真正的“信靠对象”，你就不只是难过，而是会被“击溃”：你会情绪崩溃、无力运作。凡是你真正“信靠”的东西，一旦被动摇，你周围就会围绕着极其巨大的情绪波动。

这会严重模糊你的判断力，使你不能做出智慧的选择。

所以，第二点是：“信靠上帝”。

第三点，看 5–6 节：“你要专心仰赖耶和华，不可倚靠自己的聪明；在你一切所行的事上都要认定他，他必指引你的路。”

我刚才概括为“顺服上帝的话语”。经文本身没有直接出现“圣经”、“经文”等字眼，但它说：即使你有自己的想法、自己的理解、自己的判断，你也要顺服上帝的理解和旨意，而不是倚靠自己的。

这怎么做到？《箴言》整卷书的背景是“律法”（Torah），就是上帝的教导与法则。大多数《箴言》注释家都指出，《箴言》其实就是“律法在日常生活中的应用”。所以，“在一切所行的事上认定他，不倚靠自己的聪明”，就是要浸泡在上帝的话语里：不断学习、熟悉、遵行、顺服。

当你把自己浸泡在圣经中——读、听、学、思考——这会如何让你变得有智慧呢？有一种简单的方式，也有一种较复杂的方式。

简单的方式是：圣经里有许多清楚的“道德命令”。譬如说，你已婚，而婚姻状况不太好，这时你遇到一个婚外恋的机会，甚至有人向你发出明确的邀请。你在挣扎：“我要不要？我能不能处理好？我该不该这么做？”你可以在这上面纠结很久，画各种“决策矩阵”，但其实圣经已经非常清楚地说：“不可奸淫。”你不需要为此祷告、不需要再琢磨，不需要做复杂的分析——答案已经写明了。

大约 20–25% 的人生抉择，圣经给出了非常明确的原则或命令。在这些事情上，你可以很简单地顺服。但问题是，我们往往“不喜欢”圣经说的内容。你可能说：“我不明白，为什么不可以？”——这就是“倚靠自己的聪明”。你也许不喜欢、觉得难以理解，但如果你让上帝的理解来“压过”你自己的理解，让祂的话语来塑造你的选择，久而久之，你就会比原本更有智慧。

这就是“顺服上帝话语”的简单一面。但还有一个更复杂的层面，需要一并说明——因为它很重要。

阿拉斯代尔·麦金太尔（Alasdair MacIntyre）在《德性之后》（After Virtue）一书中给了一个很有名的例子。他说：想象你在公交车站等车，突然有个年轻人走过来，你从未见过他，他也不认识你。他走到你面前，说：“野生绿头鸭（common wild duck）的拉丁学名是 *histrionicus histrionicus histrionicus*。”说完就走了。

你会怎么想？这件事确实发生了，但你要如何“理解”它？麦金太尔说：你只有一种方式能理解它，就是把它放进一个“故事”（narrative）中。只有当你编出一个故事来，这件事才会“有意义”。

他举了几个可能的故事：

第一，这个人有精神疾病或严重创伤——这是一个悲伤的故事，但它至少能解释发生了什么，也会让你对他产生同情。这非常有可能。

第二，是“认错人”的故事：也许几天前，他在图书馆找关于野鸭的书时，曾向馆员请教。而你长得有点像那个馆员。现在他在公交站看到你，以为你就是那位馆员，于是跑来说：“嘿，我找到那本书了。”——这也可能，只是没那么常见。

第三，是“间谍”的故事：这人其实是个间谍，他把你错认成自己的接头人，而刚才说的那句拉丁文其实是暗号。这当然更不寻常，但也并非完全不可能。

麦金太尔的重点是：单凭这件孤立的事件本身，你无法理解它；只有把它放入某个“故事”中，它才会被赋予意义。而你选择的“故事”，会完全决定你如何回应它。

现在，把这个思路用在你的钱财上：你如何看待你的金钱？你怎么用它？你对它抱持什么态度？这一切都取决于你认为“这个世界的故事”究竟是什么。

如果你接受世俗的版本：我们是偶然出现的；人死就没了；等太阳熄灭，宇宙冷却，最终没有任何人记得任何人做过的事——那在这种故事里，你能有的唯一幸福，就是今生此刻你能抓到的那一点点快乐。那么，你自然会以某种方式来使用你的钱。

但如果“世界的故事”完全不同呢？如果我们是上帝创造的，我们拥有的一切都是祂的礼物；这个世界堕落了，但上帝亲自进入世界来拯救它，终有一天要更新一切；如果这世上的生命并不是你存在的全部，而只是你整个永恒存在中很小的一部分——在这样的故事里，你的金钱会显得完全不同，你生命中所有其他东西也都会显得完全不同。

所以，当有人来问我：“作为一个基督徒，我到底要捐出多少，才能让上帝满意？我一点都不想比必要的多给哪怕一分钱。”——他其实是在找一个“规则”，就像“不可奸淫”那样清晰的命令，希望圣经写着：“你必须捐出收入的 12.3% 给穷人。”但事实上，圣经更多的是给我们一个完全不同的“故事”，一个如此不同的世界观，以至于它会把你变成一个远比你原本以为“规则所要求”更慷慨的人。

你越是沉浸在上帝的话语中，不仅是那 25% 的“禁令”或“命令”，而是整本圣经的叙事、诗歌、历史、比喻……你的生命每一部分都会被重新诠释，你会越来越以一种完全不同的方式来生活。而智慧，就是从这样的生命方式中长出来的，而不只是来自“有什么规则可以给我一个刚刚好的数字”。

你越是把自己浸泡在上帝的话语中，你就越成为有智慧的人。明白吗？因为在圣经所讲述的那个故事里，万事看起来都不同，你也就会以不同的方式生活。

第四个载体是“群体”。第 7 节说：“不可自以为有智慧。”

所谓“愚昧人”的定义，就是“自以为有智慧的人”——只关心从自己视角看事情的人。现在我站在这个房间的前方，从这个角度，我能看到你们看不到的景象；但你们坐在不同的位置，也能看到我看不到的细节。要真正知道这间屋子里发生了什么，需要汇聚所有人的视角。

愚昧人的特征就是：他只从自己的眼光看世界——“我不在乎别人怎么想，我只按我看到的来判断。”而智慧的定义，则是：尽可能从尽可能多的“眼睛”来看事情——从神的眼光（借着祂的话语）、从弟兄姊妹的眼光、从导师与朋友的眼光。智慧人会在多年间，刻意在自己周围建立一群“谋士”与“良友”，经常向他们请教，常常与他们商量。

我们活在一个高度个人主义的时代，人们被教导说：“这是你的人生，你自己做决定，不该让别人干涉。”“你不该向任何人负责，你不需要别人对你的人生指指点点。”——听上去很“自由”，但这让我们变得非常孤立，也非常愚昧。因为你看不到自己，你也看不到整个局面。你并不知道自己真正长什么样；你在镜子里看到的永远只是一个影像，而不是“真实的自己”。

这就是为什么很多时候，当你看到自己的照片、听到自己的录音，会下意识地说：“哇，这人好难听，这不是我吧？”而身边的朋友会说：“这就是你。”——他们的眼光，比你的更客观。只有当你深深地活在群体里，同时又浸泡在神的话语里，又学习信靠神、认识神，你才会在道路上一步步向智慧前进。

不过，到这里还没完。经文里还有一个“催化剂”，一种能让这些“载体”都高速运转的火花。那是什么？11–12 节：“我儿，你不可轻看耶和华的管教，也不可厌烦他的责备；因为耶和华所爱的，他必责备，正如父亲责备所喜爱的儿子。”

图像很清楚：一位父亲在管教儿子。父亲会把一些艰难、痛苦、让孩子哭的事带进孩子的生命里。

那这段话在本章中干嘛？你看前面的结构：1–2 节说“你若这样，就得长久日子、生命年数与平安”；3–4 节说“你若这样，就在上帝和人眼前蒙恩宠，有美名”；5–6 节说“你若这样，他必指引你的路”；7–8 节说“你若这样，就得健康与滋润”。然后，突然之间 11–12 节仿佛说：“顺服、顺服、顺服、顺服……哦顺便提一句，就算你把这些都做对了，你的生命仍然会遇到非常糟糕的事情。”

这完全出乎意料，对吗？经文一直在说：如果你这样做、那样做，就会有好结果……接着突然告诉你：即便如此，上帝仍然会让一些痛苦的事情临到你，你会遭遇管教与责备。

最基本的层面上，这其实是非常朴素的“人生智慧”：你可以把所有事情都做对，但你的人生仍然可能出大问题。你可以在道德上做对所有该做的事，工作努力、人品端正、乐善好施、顺服上帝，但仍然可能遭遇可怕的事情。如果你不承认这一点，你就还没准备好面对真实的人生；你并没有“与生命现实相对应”的熟练度——也就是说，你还不智慧。

我见过不少年轻人，当他们看到别人的人生“爆炸”时，下意识会说：“他肯定做错了什么，我不会那样做的。”——这其实是一种自我辩护，也是一种“自以为有智慧”。一旦你抓住这种想法不放，你就为自己设下一个巨大的失望：因为当你的人生也遭遇同样的打击时，你会觉得整套信仰都崩塌了。

所以，最基本层面上，这段经文是在说：即便你把一切做对，你的生命仍然可能走得很糟。这是现实。

但经文还说得更进一步：这一章讲的是“如何变得有智慧”，也就是说，这些都是让你成为智慧人的必要条件。而 11–12 节在说的是：如果你的人生里从未有过真正艰难的事，你就不可能成为一个有智慧的人。

不仅基督徒这样认为，其实世界上大多数文化和宗教都明白这个道理——只是我们现代西方文化不愿承认而已：如果你从不受苦，你会成为一个非常浅薄的人。过着一帆风顺“幸运人生”的人，往往是浅薄的。而几乎所有真正有智慧的人都会说：“我从失败、错误和苦难中学到的，比从顺利中学到的多得多。”

想想：你想真正认识自己吗？想知道自己的强项和弱点吗？那只有被试炼的时候才看得见。你想在帮助受伤者方面既有技巧又有怜悯吗？那只有当你自己受过伤、走过黑暗的时候才可能。否则，你不仅帮不上忙，还可能越帮越糟。你想真正确信、深深确信你可以信靠上帝、祂真在你这边吗？往往只有在你被“淹没”的时候才会学会。只有当你发现“耶稣是你仅有的一切”时，你才会学会“耶稣就是你所需要的一切”。

而一旦你明白这一点，你就会发现：苦难其实在“加速”其他一切塑造智慧的因素。往往只有在受苦时，你才真正学会祷告、真正学会信靠上帝、真正迫切地抓住祂的话语、真正走进基督徒群体。平时你可能“独来独往”，但苦难一来，你才发现你需要人——其实你一直需要，只是之前不肯承认。

然而，苦难并不会自动让你变智慧。正如刚才说的，智慧需要“品格”的形成：谦卑、勇气、恩典与饶恕。但苦难也可以把人变得更骄傲、更怯懦、更苦毒。你也见过这种人：有些受苦的人变得非常自以为义，觉得“你们这些人都不懂我所经历的”，从而对别人心怀轻蔑；有些人则被压垮，变得消沉无比，什么都不愿面对；还有些人变得极度愤怒、满心怨恨。

所以，当苦难临到时，它要么推着你走向智慧——更多的谦卑、更多对上帝的依靠、更多的恩典与饶恕——要么推着你走向愚昧。关键是什么？你怎样确保苦难会把你推向智慧，而不是推向愚昧？

关键就在这两节经文里：你必须在受苦之中仍然确信“上帝喜悦你”。“因为耶和华所爱的，他必责备，正如父亲责备所喜爱的儿子。”真正的父亲在管教孩子时，并不是为了毁掉孩子，而是为了培养孩子。看到孩子哭，他自己心里也会难过；但他仍然会这么做，因为他爱孩子、为孩子的成长着想。

也就是说，如果你不能在苦难中仍然确信“祂爱你、祂喜悦你”，苦难就会把你推向苦毒、推向自怜、推向绝望；反之，若你确信祂在基督里喜悦你，苦难才会柔化你、炼净你，使你更有智慧。

那你怎样才能确定这一点呢？新约《希伯来书》第 12 章引用了《箴言》3:11–12：“我儿，你不可轻看主的管教，被他责备的时候也不可灰心，因为主所爱的，他必管教，又鞭打他所收纳的儿子。”在同一段经文里，又说：“仰望为我们信心创始成终的耶稣，他因那摆在前面的喜乐，就轻看羞辱，忍受了十字架的苦难，便坐在神宝座的右边。”

答案就在这里：当你看见耶稣为你做了什么——尤其是在十字架上的那一切——你就知道自己是“被喜悦的儿女”。当耶稣受洗时，圣灵降在祂身上，有声音从天上说：“这是我的爱子，我所喜悦的。”但到了十字架上，耶稣却喊：“我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？”你会发现，那是祂唯一一次没有称呼“父啊”，而是说“我的神”。因为那时祂正被赶出、被离弃、被拒绝——祂在承担我们应得的刑罚，好叫我们因信靠祂而被赦免、被接纳。

约翰福音 1:12 说，“凡接待他的，就是信他名的人，他就赐他们权柄，作神的儿女。”罗马书 8:16 说，“圣灵与我们的心同证我们是神的儿女。”——这意味着，因着耶稣在十字架上失去“儿子的地位”，我们如今被收纳为神的儿女，圣灵会在我们心里做见证：“你是我所爱的儿女，我喜悦你。”

当你在苦难中仍然抓住这位为你受苦的救主，你就会发现，你的苦难开始像火炼金一样、像压力造钻石一样，塑造你成为一个美丽而有重量的人。你的故事被十字架重新“诠释”，你在其中经历的一切也都会被重新赋予意义。

这就是《箴言》3 章所说的智慧之路。

（本段内容与上一段紧密相连，继续讲解“智慧如何在日常生活中发生与增长”，以下为对应英文内容的中文翻译，保持原有段落结构。）

第二点，我们继续看“如何让日常选择推动你走向智慧”：经文给出四个关键渠道——认识上帝、信靠上帝、顺服祂的话语、活在群体中。我们刚刚详细谈了“认识上帝”，接下来是：

第二，信靠上帝。第五节说：“你要专心仰赖耶和华，不可倚靠自己的聪明。”

这节经文听起来很励志，很像贺卡上的金句：“要专心仰赖耶和华”，我们一听就有种被鼓舞的感觉。但它其实非常锋利，充满挑战。因为一个人是完全有可能“相信”上帝、也“顺服”上帝的一些命令（比如遵守十诫、祷告等），却在实际生活中，把“真正的信靠”放在其他事物上——用凯勒的话说，就是“把你内心真正的功能性信任交给了别的东西”。

譬如说，你相信有上帝，去教会，守诫命，祷告，可是，你真正从哪儿获得“自我价值感”？你真正从哪儿获得“安全感”？你真正认为“只要这个没出问题，我就没事”的，是你的事业吗？你的收入吗？你的学业、你的外貌、你的能力、你的恋情、你的配偶、你的孩子？这些东西才是你心里的“实质信靠对象”。

如果是这样，那一旦这些东西出现问题，你的情绪反应就会显得极端、失控——远远超过“这个情况本身所值得的悲伤”。如果事业是你真正的“神”，当它出问题时，你不只是难过，而是被彻底击垮；你会说：“我活不下去了，我什么都做不了了。”这种“巨大的情绪震荡”，正是你把心的信靠放在错误对象上的信号。

经文说：“不可倚靠自己的聪明。”这里不仅是说，不要只依赖自己的理性或直觉来决策，更是说：不要把自己的判断、自己的感觉、自己的方案当成最终可靠的那一个。你要让上帝成为你心里真正的信靠对象——让祂来决定你怎样看待成功与失败、得失与损益。

第三，顺服上帝的话语。紧接着，第 5–6 节又说：“在你一切所行的事上都要认定他，他必指引你的路。”虽然这里没有直接提到“圣经”，但整卷《箴言》的背景是上帝的律法（Torah），亦即上帝的话语。整本《箴言》可以说都是“把上帝的律法如何具体应用在日常生活中的案例集”。

换句话说，“在一切所行的事上认定他”，意味着：让上帝的话语而不是你自己的理解，成为你行为的最终准则。你在理性上可能有自己的见解，但在冲突处，你愿意让神的判断“压过”你的判断，让祂的话“裁决”你的决定。

这会如何帮助你成为有智慧的人？有一种直观、简单的方式，也有一种更深、更复杂的方式。

简单的说：圣经里有许多明确、直接的命令与禁令，比如“不可奸淫”、“不可偷盗”、“爱人如己”。当你遇到某些选择时，你可能会纠结很久，做各种分析，然而圣经已经很清楚了。凯勒举例说：一个已婚者，婚姻不太顺利，此时遇上一段婚外情的机会，甚至有人直接向他（她）发出邀请。他（她）也许会想：“我到底要不要？我可以驾驭吗？”但此时，圣经已经给了一个极其清楚的“不”。对这类问题，你甚至不需要为“要不要犯奸淫”祷告——命令已经在那儿了。

在我们人生中，大约 20–25% 的抉择，其实圣经已经给出了相当清晰的原则；在这些问题上，我们需要的不是更多的分析，而是更多的顺服。

然而，更多时候，我们“不喜欢”圣经的话，或者我们说“我不理解，为什么神要这样说？”——这其实正是“倚靠自己的聪明”的表现。你也许觉得上帝的命令“过于保守”、“不合时宜”，但如果你愿意让上帝的理解来“盖过”你的理解，让祂的话语成为“最后一句话”，那么随着时间推移，你就会发现：自己比原本更有智慧，因为你不再只按自己有限的视角做决策。

接着是更复杂的一层：圣经不只是给我们一些“规则”，还给我们一个完整的故事——关于世界从哪里来、人是谁、生命的目的是什么、未来要走向何处。只有当你把你的金钱、工作、感情、受苦……放入这个“故事”里，你才会以完全不同的方式来理解它们。凯勒借用哲学家麦金太尔的例子说明：如果一个陌生人突然走过来，告诉你“野鸭的拉丁文名字是 XXX”就离开了——这个行为本身只有放进某个故事里，才有意义。你的回应会完全取决于你选择的是哪种故事：是精神病患者？是认错人？是间谍暗号？

同样地，你怎么用钱、怎么面对损失、怎么看待工作的意义，亦完全取决于你相信“自己活在怎样一个故事里”。如果你相信的是“纯粹世俗”的故事——人是偶然的、死了就没了、宇宙最终归于虚无——那“今生有限时间里的快乐”就会成为你唯一实际的目标，自然也会深刻影响你对金钱与享乐的态度。

而如果你相信圣经讲述的故事：世界是神所造的，你拥有的一切都是祂的恩赐；世界堕落了，但神正亲自介入，要在基督里更新万有；今生只是整个永恒生命极小的一部分……在这样的故事中，你就会对财富、成功、失败、牺牲，作出完全不同的判断。这不仅是“给出一个规则：你必须捐多少”，而是透过整个故事——十字架、复活、永恒——把你塑造成一个更慷慨、更自由的人。

一个人越是沉浸在这套故事中，就越不容易被短暂的得失蒙蔽眼睛——而这，正是智慧成长的土壤。

第四，群体。第 7 节说：“不可自以为有智慧。”

“自以为有智慧”，就是“只从自己的角度看事情”，不愿意从他人的视角来看世界，也不愿意让别人指出自己的盲点。凯勒举例说：此刻我站在台上，我能看到的一些东西，是你们看不到的；但你们的位置也让你们看到许多我看不到的细节。要真正了解这个房间里正在发生什么，就需要所有人的视角。

“愚昧人”的典型就是：只相信自己的眼光——“我看见的才是真的，我的感觉不会错。”而经文说，“不要做那样的人”。智慧人懂得：他需要他人的视角，需要神的话语的视角，需要属灵长辈、朋友、同伴的视角。智慧人会在自己的生命中，刻意培养一圈“谋士”和“朋友”，在许多重要问题上，习惯性地向他们请教、接受他们的提醒和制衡。

然而，我们活在一个强烈个人主义的文化中，人们被教导说：“你是你命运的唯一主人，你不用对任何人负责。你的人生你自己说了算。”——听起来像是“自由”，却往往使我们远离真正的智慧和真正的自由。因为我们其实看不见自己，看不清处境，也看不见自己给别人带来的影响。只有活在真实的群体里，接受彼此的提醒与纠正，我们才不会“自以为有智慧”。

凯勒提到一个有趣的事实：你其实不知道自己真正的样子。你听到自己的录音，常常会说：“这声音好难听，这不是我吧。”别人却说：“这就是你。”你甚至无法凭自己的体感，知道自己在别人眼中是什么模样——你需要别人的眼睛来帮你看清自己。

因此，要增长智慧，你不仅需要“认识上帝”“信靠上帝”“顺服祂的话语”，还需要深深地活在一个有真实关系的群体中，让别人可以对你说真话，让你可以从别人的眼光审视自己的动机与决定。

到这里，我们看到：认识神、信靠神、顺服神的话语、活在群体中，这四个“载体”会在日常生活中一点点塑造你的品格，从而使你在大小抉择上越来越有智慧。接下来，凯勒指出，还有一个“催化剂”，能让这四个载体一起“加速运转”——那就是“受苦”与“管教”，这部分内容在下一小段继续展开。

（本段为上一段的延续，集中讲“受苦与管教如何成为智慧的催化剂”，对应英文原文的后半部分，保持原有段落结构。）

现在，我们来到第四个“载体”之后的那个“催化剂”。第 11–12 节说：“我儿，你不可轻看耶和华的管教，也不可厌烦他的责备；因为耶和华所爱的，他必责备，正如父亲责备所喜爱的儿子。”

图像很清楚：那是一位父亲在管教儿子。一个真正爱孩子的父亲，会在孩子生命中安排一些难熬、痛苦、让孩子流泪的事——不是为了伤害他，而是为了塑造他、使他成熟。那这样的经文为什么会出现在这里？

如果你留意本章的结构，会发现前面几节似乎是一个接一个的“如果……就……”：

1–2 节说：“你若不忘记我的法则，谨守我的诫命，就必得长久日子、生命年数与平安。”

3–4 节说：“你若不要让慈爱、诚实离开你，就会在神和世人眼前蒙恩宠，有美名。”

5–6 节说：“你若专心仰赖耶和华、不倚靠自己的聪明，在一切所行的事上认定他，他必指引你的路。”

7–8 节说：“你若不自以为有智慧、敬畏耶和华、远离恶事，就要得着医治与滋润。”

按这个节奏，我们原本会期待：只要你把这些都做对，你的生命就会一路顺风顺水——然而，突然 11–12 节插进来，好像在说：“顺服、顺服、顺服、顺服……哦，对了，即便你都做对了，人生仍然会发生可怕的事；上帝仍然会容许苦难临到你。”

这非常出乎意料，却极其重要。因为它告诉我们两个层面的真理。

最基本的层面是：你可以尽力把事情做对，你的生命仍然可能走向艰难和痛苦。如果你不承认这一点，你就还没准备好面对真实的人生。许多年轻人看到别人遭遇灾难时，会自动假设：“他肯定做错了什么，我不会那样。”这种反应既是自我安慰，也是自我欺骗——它在某种意义上是一种“自以为有智慧”。如果你坚持这种看法，有一天，当苦难打到你身上时，你会因为“我明明都照圣经做了却还是这样”而感到极大的困惑与愤怒，甚至怀疑整套信仰。

而第二个层面则更进一步：既然这一整章在谈“如何成为有智慧的人”，那么 11–12 节就告诉我们：若没有受苦、若没有被上帝“管教”的经历，你很难真正成为一个有智慧的人。几乎所有文化、宗教、哲学都在某种程度上承认：从未受过苦的人，通常都是浅薄的人。那些一切顺利、从未被击打过的人，往往也缺乏深度与同理心。真正有智慧的人，几乎都承认：自己在失败、错误与苦难中学到的东西，比在成功与顺利中学到的多得多。

苦难会逼你正视自己真正的信靠对象；苦难会逼你看见自己的软弱与盲点；苦难也会使你更能体会他人的痛苦，从而在帮助别人时，不会那么轻率、不着边际。

然而，苦难并不会“自动”把人变得更好。它既可以把人塑造成谦卑、勇敢、饶恕、慈爱的样式，也可以把人扭曲成骄傲、自怜、苦毒、愤恨的样式。你也许见过那种人：他们受了很多苦，于是变得极其自以为义——觉得“没人懂我的痛”，甚至用自己的痛苦来当作向别人发泄的理由；也有人被苦难压垮，整个人变得极度消沉，不再愿意面对任何挑战；还有人被苦难吞噬，变成终日愤怒的人。

所以，当苦难临到时，它要么推着你走向智慧，要么推着你走向愚昧。关键在于：你在苦难中，相信怎样的“故事”？你是否仍然确信自己是“被神所爱、被神所喜悦的儿女”？

经文说：“耶和华所爱的，他必责备，正如父亲责备所喜爱的儿子。”真正的父亲，在管教儿女时，并不是为了发泄怒气，而是出于爱。看到孩子痛哭，他的心也会疼；但他愿意承受这种“心疼”，好让孩子成长成熟。若你在苦难中不能抓住这一点——不能确信“在基督里，神对你仍然是喜悦的”——那苦难就极可能把你推向硬心、绝望或自以为义。

新约《希伯来书》第 12 章引用了《箴言》3:11–12：“我儿，你不可轻看主的管教，被他责备的时候也不可灰心；因为主所爱的，他必管教，又鞭打凡所收纳的儿子。”在那段经文里，还有一句十分关键的话：“仰望为我们信心创始成终的耶稣，他因那摆在前面的喜乐，就轻看羞辱，忍受了十字架的苦难，便坐在神宝座的右边。”

换句话说，你要如何在受苦中确信“自己是蒙爱、蒙喜悦的儿女”？答案不是去看环境好不好，也不是看自己的表现够不够好，而是“仰望耶稣”——特别是仰望祂在十字架上为你所做的一切。

当耶稣受洗时，圣灵降临在祂身上，天父的声音说：“这是我的爱子，我所喜悦的。”然而，当祂挂在十字架上时，祂却喊：“我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？”你会注意到，那是福音书中唯一一次，耶稣没有称呼神为“父”，而是叫“我的神”。因为在十字架上，祂正在承担原本属于我们的弃绝与审判：祂被“赶出家门”，好叫凡信靠祂的人得以被“收纳进家”；祂失去儿子的地位，好叫我们被收纳为儿女。

约翰福音 1:12 说：“凡接待他的，就是信他名的人，他就赐他们权柄，作神的儿女。”罗马书 8:16 说：“圣灵与我们的心同证我们是神的儿女。”——也就是说，因为耶稣在十字架上被离弃，我们因着信，就可以在圣灵里听见那一句：“你是我所爱的儿子／女儿，我喜悦你。”

当你在苦难中转眼仰望十字架，看见那位为你忍受极大苦难的救主，你就能够说：“若祂肯为我做到那一步，祂必然不会在真正对我有益的事上亏待我。”这一信心会重新诠释你生命中的一切苦难——它们不再只是毫无意义的灾难，而是像烈火炼金子、像高压造钻石一样，成为上帝用来塑造你、使你有智慧、有深度、有重量的工具。

于是，你便能在苦难中，继续“认识神、信靠神、顺服祂的话语、活在群体中”，让这些“载体”在压力之下被“涡轮增压”。苦难不再只是摧毁你，反而成为神用来建造你的方式——使你一步步走在那条“智慧之路”上，越来越像那位在十字架上为你舍命、也是“智慧的化身”的主耶稣基督。

这一点我们刚才已经讲过：走“生命之路”，就是在平凡日常中，一步接着一步地前行——那是一个稳定、简单却持续的动作。你在日常生活里重复所做的那些行动，正在把你变成某种人；你不能保持原样不变。你在普通日子里如何行为、做什么选择，正在把你塑造成一个智慧人或愚昧人；因为品格就是在这些小地方被锻造出来的。

没有人比 C.S. 路易斯更清楚地说明这一点。他说：每天，当你做那些细小的决定时，你就在你的灵魂上刻下一点“小痕迹”、加上一点“小扭曲”。就这样，借着你每天一步又一步所走的那条道路——你日常生活中的行为与选择——你要么一点一点被塑造成一个像天使的人，要么一点一点被塑造成一个像恶魔的人。

他在《返璞归真》中“论饶恕”的一章给了一个例子：假设有一天，你看到报纸上一则新闻，报道一群你本来就不喜欢的人，他们似乎做了非常丑恶、骇人听闻的事情，很快就要掀起大丑闻，他们也会因此被赶下台。你一向不喜欢他们的立场和政治观点，现在看到这则新闻，心里甚至有些开心：“看吧，我就知道他们不好。”

过了一周，你又看到一则报道说：原来的新闻并不准确，或者至少没有那么糟，被夸大了。这时，你有一个选择，虽然你可能没察觉。你可以说：“哇，太好了，原来他没我想的那么坏。”或者，你也可以感到很失望，心里想：“真可惜，我还希望他是那样坏的人。”

路易斯说，如果你选择前一种反应——“感谢主，他没那么糟”——那么事情就停在那儿了。但如果你选择后一种反应，而且在心里暗暗决定要紧抓住第一则、夸张的报道不放，只因为“把仇敌想得越坏”让你感到一种扭曲的快感——那么，你就踏出了一个过程的第一步，如果一直走到底，就会把你变成一个“魔鬼”。

你开始希望“黑的再黑一点”，后来，你就会想把“灰色”当成“黑色”；再后来，你甚至能把“白色”当成“黑色”；最终，你会永远被固定在一个纯粹由仇恨构成的宇宙里。因为我们基督徒相信，灵魂是永远存在的；真正重要的是，那些一笔一划刻在你灵魂最深处的“痕迹”，它们终究会把你变成天上的或地狱里的受造物。

换句话说，当你本就不喜欢某人，又听到关于他的一个极坏的消息；后来你又知道事情并没有那么严重，但你心里却说：“我还是想把他想得那么坏。”你刻意坚持那种夸大的说法，只因为你心里的怨恨与牢骚让你“享受”那样的想象。在那一刻，你就比一分钟前更加愚昧，因为你选择相信一些很可能并不真实的东西。

接着，凯勒说：想想三种品格特质：谦卑 vs. 骄傲；勇气 vs. 怯懦；恩典与饶恕 vs. 愤怒与苦毒。如果你愤怒、怨恨，你就会“想要”别人很坏，即使事实并非如此。因此，只要看到一点点似乎支持你偏见的证据，你就会牢牢抓住；而任何显示那个人没有那么糟的迹象，你都会忽略。这就是“与现实脱节”。你在心中创造了一个不真实的“他”，然后在这个虚假的形象基础上做决定。

智慧是“与生命现实相对应的熟练度”。智慧意味着：不是按你“以为”的现实，而是按“真正的现实”来做选择。如果你是一个胆小鬼，或者你骄傲到不肯听别人的劝告，你就会更加固执地认为自己的感觉和意见总是对的——这同样会让你远离现实。

于是，第一个大点就很清楚了：你每日在小事上的选择，要么在一点一点地让你变得更怨恨、更胆怯、更骄傲，要么在一点一点让你变得更有爱心、更肯饶恕、更有勇气。你的品格越坚实，你就越贴近现实，也就越有智慧。

因此，在日常生活中，你所做的那些微小选择，正在塑造你的品格；而正是在这些品格的基础上，你才会在重大决策上做出智慧或愚昧的选择。生命是一条路，而智慧就是在这条路上，一步又一步、极其渐进地被获得或被失去。

第二个大点是：既然日常的小选择会塑造品格、决定我们是否走向智慧，那么，我们要如何“布置环境”，好让自己在日常生活中更容易做出正确的选择？经文在这里提到了四件事：认识上帝、信靠上帝、顺服祂的话语、活在群体中。

这些我们已经在前面开始展开，所以这一小段主要是一个过渡——提醒我们：正是这些日复一日的小动作，塑造了谦卑、勇气、恩典等品格；而这些品格，反过来又成为你在重大问题上做出智慧决定的基础。你越在这些“基础动作”上忠心、稳定，你的生命就越在一条通往智慧而非愚昧的道路上。

换句话说，本段相当于把前后两部分连接起来：前面讲“生命是道路、日常是关键”；后面讲“这四件事是让你在日常中不断朝智慧方向行走的关键实践”。这四件事在后续的段落会被逐一展开。

在这一小段里，凯勒开始明确列出那“四件事”：

1）认识上帝（knowing God）
2）信靠上帝（trusting God）
3）顺服祂的话语（submitting to His Word）
4）活在群体中（living in community）

接着，他从第一项开始展开：“认识上帝”。

他引用第三节：“不可使慈爱、诚实离开你，要系在你颈项上，刻在你心版上。”表面一读，我们可能会以为这是在说：“要做一个有爱、有信实的人。”好像是叫我们要“有慈爱、有诚实”。但如果仔细看语气和原文，你会发现它并不是单纯在说“性格品质”，而是说：不要让“慈爱和信实”离开你，要把它们系在颈项上、刻在心版上——仿佛它们是某种你必须紧紧抓住、不可以失去的东西。

凯勒解释说：这里提到的“慈爱”和“诚实（信实）”，在希伯来文里是两个非常重要的词，常用于描写“上帝对祂子民的盟约之爱”。“慈爱”一词（chesed），常指上帝对祂子民无条件的爱、承诺、信实与恩典——是一种“祂已经把自己毫无保留地交给你”的爱。因此，当经文说“不可使慈爱、诚实离开你”，其实在说的是：不要让你对“上帝那无条件、盟约式的爱与信实”的把握从你心中滑走；要把这种认识挂在脖子上、刻在心里、常常思想、出口谈论。

换句话说，第三节真正的重点是：你需要在你“心的心”的深处，牢牢抓住这样的事实——神是站在你这边的；祂愿意为你做一切；祂已经为你做了你所需要的一切；祂对你有绝对的承诺，不会放弃你。

这样的一种认识，如何带来智慧？凯勒说，如果你真的在心底深处知道、且不断提醒自己：上帝对你有无条件的爱与信实，那就会给你一种“从容稳重”（poise）。你就不那么容易惊慌失措，不会总是“心里狂跑”。恐慌常常让人做出愚蠢的决定，而深深知道“上帝站在我这边、祂爱我、祂不会抛弃我”，就会使你即便在困境中，也更能冷静思考，从而做出有智慧的选择。

那么，该如何“把慈爱、诚实系在颈项上，刻在心版上”呢？凯勒说，至少有一件事是必不可少的：要有真诚而有规律的祷告生活。你需要不断地把“上帝爱我、祂是信实的”从一个抽象的概念，借着祷告，变成你心里真实的把握；这不是一天一次的概念，而是很可能一天多次地、持续地在生活中与上帝对话——读经、祷告、默想、在日常中操练“活在祂面前”，不断提醒自己祂在基督里为你已经做成的一切。

于是，“认识上帝”就不仅仅是“知道一些关于上帝的事实”，而是：在日常生活中，真实地与祂同行，时刻记得祂不离不弃的爱。这种认识，会在无形中塑造你的选择，使你在“日复一日的小事”上更少出于恐惧和不安做决定，而更多出于信心和安稳做决定。这样，品格被塑造，智慧也随之增长。

在这一小段里，凯勒继续展开“认识上帝、信靠上帝、顺服祂的话语、活在群体中”这四条路径。

首先是“认识上帝”：第三节说，“不可使慈爱、诚实离开你，要系在你颈项上，刻在你心版上。”这里的“慈爱”和“诚实（信实）”，在希伯来文里是专用来描述上帝对祂子民盟约之爱的词汇——尤其是“慈爱”（chesed），指祂无条件的爱、坚定的承诺和信实的恩典，是“祂已经毫无保留把自己交给你”的意思。

经文不是简单地叫你“做一个有爱、有信实的人”，而是在说：你要紧紧抓住、绝不放手的，是“上帝那无条件的爱与信实”；你要把这种认识挂在颈项上、刻在心版上，让它成为你随时可以想起、随时可以默想的真理。

凯勒说，你需要在你“心的心”的深处，反复确认、绝不失去对这件事的把握：神是为你的，祂愿意为你做一切，祂已经为你做了你最深切需要的一切，祂对你有不可撤销的承诺。

这种认识，为什么会产生智慧？因为如果你真的深信上帝无条件的爱与信实，就会在你心里产生一种“稳定的从容”（poise）：你不会那么容易惊慌失措，也不会时时觉得自己在“孤军奋战”。恐惧和慌乱往往驱动人做出愚蠢的决定，而深知“神站在我这边”能让你在压力之下仍然冷静、清醒地判断，从而做出更符合现实、更贴近真相的选择——这正是智慧。

那么，如何在日常里把这种认识“系在颈项上、刻在心版上”呢？至少有一件基础的事必不可少：祷告生活。你需要不断地、持续地，把“神的爱”和“神的信实”从抽象概念，通过祷告和默想，变成你心里真实的感受与依靠。你要在每天生活中，养成与神对话的节奏——读经、祷告、回想祂的作为、操练“活在祂面前”。随着时间推移，“神是为我的、祂不会离弃我”就不再只是一句神学命题，而成为你做决定时真正倚靠的根基。

接着是“信靠上帝”：第五节说，“你要专心仰赖耶和华，不可倚靠自己的聪明。”凯勒提醒我们，这句经文听起来很温柔、很激励人，但其实十分锋利——因为人可以一方面“相信有神、也遵守一些诫命”，却在另一方面，把心中真正的信靠交给别的事物：事业、钱财、外貌、才华、感情或家庭等等。

他指出，一个很实际的辨别方式就是：观察当这些东西出问题时，你的情绪反应到什么程度。如果事业只是你生命的一部分，它受挫时你会难过、会痛苦，但尚能运作；然而，如果事业是你真正的“信靠对象”，一旦受挫，你就会情绪崩溃、几乎无法工作或正常生活——那说明，你把心里的“功能性信任”给了事业，而不是给了神。

经文说“不可倚靠自己的聪明”，不只是说不要盲目相信自己的理性或直觉，更是在说：不要让你的判断、感觉、计划成为你最终倚靠的“神”。你需要学会在实际生活中，让神成为你真正的安全感来源——让祂来重新界定什么是成功、什么是失败、什么值得害怕、什么不值得害怕。

然后是“顺服祂的话语”：5–6 节接着说，“在你一切所行的事上都要认定他，他必指引你的路。”整卷《箴言》的背景是上帝的律法（Torah），也就是神已经启示的话。所谓“在一切所行的事上认定他”，就是让神的话语、而不是你的理解，成为你行为的最终标准；你的意见可以存在，但在冲突处，你愿意让神的意见“压过”你的意见，让祂的话有最后发言权。

这如何帮助你成长为有智慧的人？简单层面上，圣经有许多非常明确的命令和禁令——比如“不可奸淫”、“不可偷盗”等。当你在某些决定上纠结时，你其实不需要再“画决策矩阵”，而是需要更单纯的顺服。凯勒举婚外情的例子说明：你可以为此纠结很久，但圣经已经说得很清楚——在婚姻中，不。

更深一层，圣经不仅给我们一些“规则”，更给我们一个完整的“世界故事”：世界从哪里来、人是谁、人生的目标是什么、历史走向何处。当你越多地把自己浸泡在圣经中——读叙事、读诗歌、读律法、读书信——你就越会从这个故事的角度来看自己的工作、金钱、感情和苦难。凯勒借用麦金太尔的例子：只有把一个孤立的事件放进某个“故事”里，它才有意义，你会根据故事来决定如何回应它。同样地，只有当你把自己的人生放入圣经的故事中，你才会对自己的处境有更真实、更深刻的理解——而这正是智慧的核心。

在这一小段里，凯勒进一步说明“信靠上帝”与“顺服祂的话语”如何在实际生活中运作，并指出：

如果你把任何受造之物——无论是外貌、智力、才干、事业、财富、家庭、恋人或配偶——当成你心里的“实质信靠对象”，那么围绕这些东西，你的情绪波动就会格外剧烈。一旦它们出问题，你就不仅是“伤心难过”，而是会陷入“彻底崩溃”的状态，甚至无法正常运作。正是这种“异常巨大的情绪反应”，暴露了你的心已经把它们当成了“功能性的神”。

而当某样东西被你当成“神”来信靠时，它就会遮蔽你的判断力，使你很难真正面对现实，从而不断做出愚蠢的决定。反之，当你在日常生活中，不断操练把这类“功能性信靠”挪回到神身上，把自己的安全感和价值感扎根在祂的爱与承诺里，你的视角就会更清晰，你看事物的眼光也会更贴近真相——这会让你在许多决策上更加有智慧。

接着，他谈到“顺服神的话语”。虽然经文没有直接提“圣经”这个字眼，但整个《箴言》都是在“律法”（Torah）的背景中写成的。它基本上就是“神的律法在日常生活里的运用手册”。因此，“不要倚靠自己的聪明，在一切所行的事上要认定祂”，就是在说：不要只按自己的直觉和偏好行事，而是要不断把自己的想法拿去和神已经启示的话语对照，当两者冲突时，让神的话来纠正、修剪你的想法。

凯勒先从“简单的层面”举例：对于某些问题，圣经给出的命令非常清楚——例如婚姻里的忠诚。你也许会在感性上挣扎，觉得“我不明白为什么神这么严格”，但如果你愿意让“神的理解”胜过“自己的理解”，你就在一步步训练自己，让心服在真理之下。这种训练，会在长期内大大增加你的智慧，因为你不再只从“眼前的感觉”做决定，而是在更大的真理框架里行事。

然后，他开始提到“更复杂的层面”——即圣经不仅给我们“规则”，还给我们一个“宏大的叙事”：关于世界、人类、罪、救赎、未来的新天新地。当你越多地浸泡在这套叙事里，你就越会发现：自己看钱、看工作、看成功失败、看苦难，都和以前完全不一样了。你不会再只是问：“到底多少才算给够？”而是会被整个福音故事塑造成一个更慷慨、更自由的人——因为你已经深知：一切都是白白得来的恩典，这一生也并非全部，真正的报偿在永恒里。

在这段里，凯勒继续展开“圣经叙事如何重塑我们看钱与看世界的方式”，并引出第四个载体“群体”：

他引用麦金太尔在《德性之后》中的例子：你在公交站等车，一个陌生年轻人跑来，对你说：“普通野鸭的拉丁学名是 histrionicus, histrionicus, histrionicus。”说完就走了。要理解这件事，你必须把它放进某个故事里：也许他是精神病人，也许是认错了人（把你当成图书馆里曾帮助过他的馆员），也许是间谍把你误当成接头人、刚才那句话其实是暗号。只有当你决定“这是哪一个故事”时，你才能知道如何回应。

凯勒借此指出：你如何看自己的钱财、工作、成就和损失，完全取决于你相信“自己正活在怎样的故事里”。如果你接受的是一种纯粹世俗的故事——人是偶然产生的，死了就什么都没了，将来宇宙终将冷却、归于虚无——那么“今生有限时段内的快乐”就会成为你唯一实际的目标，你自然会以某种方式对待你的钱：尽可能抓住、尽可能消费在自己身上，因为你觉得“只有现在才是全部”。

但若你相信圣经的故事：我们是上帝创造的，一切所有都是祂的礼物；世界堕落了，但神在基督里进入世界、来拯救并更新万有；今生只是整个永恒生命的极小一部分……那么，你看钱、看损失、看奉献的方式就完全不同。你不会只问：“我到底需要捐多少，才能不再有亏欠感？”而是会在福音的故事里，越来越被塑造成一个“知道自己一切都是领受来的、因此乐于分享”的人。

因此，当有人问：“作为一个基督徒，我到底要捐多少钱，神才会满意？我一点都不想比必要的多给哪怕一分钱。”——其实是在寻找一个“规则”，好像十诫那样清楚：仿佛圣经应该规定“你必须捐出收入的 12.3%”。但凯勒说，圣经给我们的更多是一个完全不同的故事：这个故事深刻地改变我们看世界、看自己、看财富、看永恒的方式。当你越多地沉浸在这个故事里，你就越少被“最低合格标准”的心态所捆绑，越多被塑造成一个在各方面都更慷慨、更有智慧的人。

接着，他引入第四个载体“群体”。第 7 节说：“不要自以为有智慧。”在《箴言》中，“愚昧人”的定义之一，就是“只从自己的眼光看世界的人”——他只在乎“自己怎么看”，不在乎“别人怎么看”。而“智慧人”的特征，则是尽可能从更多的眼睛来看事情：从神的眼光（借着祂的话语）、从朋友与属灵导师的眼光、从群体的眼光。凯勒说，一个智慧人会在多年中刻意在自己身边建立一圈“谋士”和“朋友”——在许多重大事情上，他习惯性地请教他们、让他们对自己的判断提出挑战与修正。

他也指出，我们所处的是一个高度个人主义的社会：文化不断告诉你“这是你的人生，你自己说了算，你不该让别人干涉”。但现实是：你看不见自己。你连自己真实的样子都认不清——不然你就不会每次听到录音都说“这不是我的声音吧？”；你的朋友反而比你更了解你在别人眼中是什么样子。所以，只有当你深深地活在一个真实的群体中，接受彼此的提醒与制衡，再加上你不断地在神的话语里浸泡、学习信靠祂、认识祂，你才会在道路上越走越有智慧。

在这一小段里，凯勒用一个具体例子说明“顺服神的话语”在实践中的样子：

假设你已经结婚，但婚姻目前并不顺利。这时，你遇到一个婚外情的机会，甚至对方已经明确向你发出邀请。你开始内心挣扎，画各种利弊表格，做“决策矩阵”，想：“我到底要不要？我能不能处理好？这会不会是让我快乐的机会？”——在这样的情境中，圣经其实已经给出了非常明确、毫不含糊的答案：“不可奸淫。”你在婚约之中作出的承诺，在神面前仍然有效。

凯勒指出，在这类问题上，你并不需要再“不断祷告看神的心意是什么”，也不需要反复分析、反复斟酌。经文已经清楚地告诉你该怎么做。大约 20–25% 的人生抉择，圣经以清晰的命令给出了“轨道”——这些地方，你要的不是更多资讯，而是更单纯的顺服。

然而，许多时候，我们会说：“我不明白，为什么神这么讲？我不喜欢这样的要求。”——这恰恰是“倚靠自己的聪明”的表现。你也许不喜欢圣经对某件事的教导，或觉得难以理解；但“在一切所行的事上认定祂”的意思之一，就是：在你不理解、也不喜欢的时候，仍然让祂的理解“压过”你的理解。凯勒说，这正是让你随着时间变得更加有智慧的关键方式之一——因为你不再只按自己的感觉、偏好和短期利益做决定，而是在更大的真理框架里行事。

接着，他转入“更复杂的一层”：圣经不仅提供明确的道德命令，还提供一个完整的“世界故事”。他预告说，接下来要讲的这一层对智慧极其重要——因为它会改变你看钱、看工作、看成功失败、看苦难的整个方式，而不仅仅是个别事件的“对错判断”。

在紧接着的部分，他顺势引入了新城要理问答（New City Catechism）等资源的广告内容——呼吁听众使用这类工具来深化信仰根基、帮助孩子和新信徒掌握基要真理。这些都围绕同一个核心：让神的话语和神的故事深深进入你的心和生活，以致你越来越能在复杂的处境中做出智慧的抉择。

在这一小段里，凯勒正式引用哲学家阿拉斯代尔·麦金太尔在《德性之后》（After Virtue）中的著名例子：

想象你在公交站等车，一个你从未见过的年轻人走过来，对你说：“普通野鸭的拉丁学名是 *histrionicus histrionicus histrionicus*。”然后他就走了。事情确实发生了，但你要如何理解它？麦金太尔说：你必须把它放进某个“故事”（narrative）中。这件事本身无法解释，只有当你给它安放一个故事背景，它才会“有意义”。

他举了至少三种可能的故事：

1）他是精神有问题或受到严重创伤的人——这是一个悲伤的故事，却能解释他的行为，也会激起你的同情。

2）他认错人：几天前，他在图书馆查找有关野鸭的书，曾向某位图书管理员求助，而你长得有点像那位馆员。图书馆光线昏暗，他认错了人，于是跑来告诉你：“我找到那本书了。”

3）他是个间谍，把你误认为自己的接头人，而刚才那句拉丁文其实是暗号。

麦金太尔的结论是：这件事本身无法被理解，除非你把它放进一个叙事中；而你选择的是哪一个叙事，将完全决定你如何回应它。

凯勒借此转向我们自己的生活，特别是对“金钱”的态度。他问：你如何看待你拥有的钱？你如何使用它、对待它？这些都取决于你相信“世界的故事”是什么。

如果你接受世俗的叙事：我们是偶然出现的；人死就什么都没有了；等太阳熄灭，最终没有人记得任何人做过的事——那么，在这样的故事里，你能拥有的幸福就只有“此时此刻”；今生有限时段内的满足，是你唯一实际的目标。在这种叙事下，你看钱的方式必然会朝某个方向倾斜：自然会更倾向于抓住、消费、享受，因为你觉得“只此一生”。

但如果你换一个故事：相信世界是上帝创造的，你的一切所有都是祂的恩赐；世界虽堕落，但神在基督里介入并开始救赎，将来要更新新的天地；今生只是你整个永恒存在中极小的一部分——那么，你看钱、看损失、看奉献、看牺牲的方式就会完全不同。你会明白：在永恒的尺度上，“少一点今生的消费，多一点对人的慷慨”并不是吃亏，而是参与神的工作。

凯勒指出，当人来问他：“作为一个基督徒，我到底应该捐多少，神才会满意？我一点都不想比必要的多给一分钱。”——其实是在寻找一个“规则”，就像“不可奸淫”那样清楚。好像圣经应该写明：“你要把收入的 12.3% 捐给穷人。”

但圣经给我们的不只是一个“最低合格标准”，而是一整个完全不同的故事：这个故事的重心是恩典，是神白白赐下的一切，是基督在十字架上为我们所做的，是将来的复活与新造。当你越多地沉浸在这个故事里，你就越不会只在意“到底要给多少才算够”，而是会越来越自然地被塑造成一个乐于分享、慷慨自由的人——这，比一个冰冷的百分比规则更能真正塑造智慧。

这一小段继续说明：当你越多地浸泡在圣经的话语与叙事中，你的整个人生视角就会被改变。

凯勒说：当你不再只是零散地摘取圣经里的“规则”，而是把整本圣经的历史、叙事、诗歌、先知书、书信都纳入你的心中——你就会发现，自己看待人生各个部分的方式都不一样了：看钱、看权力、看苦难、看成功与失败，都被放进一个新的框架里。你的生活方式随之改变，而智慧，正是从这样的新生活方式中长出来的——而不仅仅是从几条“额外规则”中长出来。

接着，他引出第四个载体：“群体”（community）。

第 7 节说：“不要自以为有智慧。”在《箴言》中，“愚昧人”的定义之一，就是“自以为有智慧的人”——只关心从自己角度看事情的人。他不在乎别人怎么想，也不愿意从他人的视角看问题。

凯勒举例说：此刻他站在讲台上，从这个位置，他能看到一些会众看不到的东西；而会众坐在不同位置，也能看到他看不到的细节。若要真正知道整个房间里发生了什么，就必须综合每个人的视角。

因此，“愚昧人”只信自己的眼睛，只以自己的感受为准；而“智慧人”则尽可能通过多双眼睛看世界——尤其是神的话语和属灵群体的眼睛。凯勒说，在《箴言》的构图中，一个智慧人，是一个在多年中有意识地在自己周围建立“谋士群”的人：导师、辅导、朋友、同伴——在许多重大事情上，他会主动找他们商量、听取他们的建议和纠正。

然而，我们身处一个极度个人主义的社会：文化教导人说，“你的人生你自己做主，你不该对任何人负责，你不该让别人对你的选择说三道四。”——听起来似乎很自由，但实际上非常危险。因为事实是：你看不见你自己。你连自己长什么样都不清楚，否则你就不会每次听到自己录音时都说“这不是我吧？”；你的朋友反而比你更清楚自己在别人眼中是什么样子。

凯勒说，你需要群体——真实的、彼此说真话的群体——来帮助你看见自己，看见你盲点中的那一部分现实。只有在这样的群体中，你才能真正活在现实里，而不是活在自己的幻象里。也只有这样，“认识神、信靠神、顺服祂的话语”这三条路径，才会真正扎根进你的实际生活，而不只是停留在头脑中的理念。

在这一小段里，凯勒转入第四个关键主题——“受苦与管教如何成为智慧的催化剂”。

他引用了 11–12 节：“我儿，你不可轻看耶和华的管教，也不可厌烦他的责备；因为耶和华所爱的，他必责备，正如父亲责备所喜爱的儿子。”

他指出，这段经文出现在本章结构中的方式非常出人意料：

1–2 节说：“你若谨守我的教训，就得长久日子、生命年数与平安”；

3–4 节说：“你若不让慈爱、诚实离开你，就在神和人面前蒙恩宠，有美名”；

5–6 节说：“你若专心仰赖耶和华、在一切所行的事上认定他，他必指引你的路”；

7–8 节说：“你若不自以为有智慧、敬畏耶和华、远离恶事，就得健康与滋润”。

按这个节奏，我们会以为：只要你都做对，你的生命就会一路顺遂。然而，11–12 节突然插进来：即便你做对了这些事，人生仍然会发生艰难的事；神仍然会容许“管教”和“责备”临到祂所爱的儿女。

凯勒说，从最基本的层面来看，这是一种十分朴素的“人生智慧”：你可以做好许多事，仍然会经历重大挫折。如果你不承认这一点，你就还没有真正准备好面对现实的人生——你还在某种程度上“与现实脱节”。有些年轻人一看到别人经历灾难，就本能地说：“他肯定做错了什么，我不会那样。”这种反应既是一种自我安慰，也是一种自欺；它其实是一种“自以为有智慧”。若你坚持这种想法，有一天当自己也遭遇苦难时，就很容易对神和信仰产生深深的失望甚至愤怒。

但凯勒也说，这段经文还传达另一个更深的真理：这整章在谈“如何成为一个智慧人”，而 11–12 节在其中的意思是：没有人能在一帆风顺中长成真正有智慧的人。换句话说，“没有经过苦难的人通常是浅薄的”；而那些真正有智慧、内心有重量的人，几乎都能回顾说：“我在失败、错误和痛苦中学到的，比在成功顺利中学到的多得多。”

他举例说：

– 若你想真正认识自己、知道自己的强项与弱点，你需要“被试炼”。只有在压力之下，你才能看见自己真正的反应。

– 若你想成为一个“在安慰受伤者方面既有技巧又有怜悯”的人，你必须自己也曾走过某种伤痛的道路。否则，你在尝试安慰他人时，往往会说出“听起来对，但一点帮助都没有”的话，甚至会越帮越糟。

– 若你想绝对确信自己可以信靠神、确信祂在你这边，以致任何环境都不能轻易动摇你，你往往需要经历“水深火热”的时刻——直到你发现：“当我什么都没有的时候，我还有基督”；而那时你才真正学会：“基督就是我所需要的一切”。

凯勒说，当我们看见这一点，就会明白：苦难其实是在“涡轮增压”其他所有帮助我们走向智慧的因素。往往只有在受苦时，我们才真正认真地祷告、才真正停止依靠其他“假神”、转而更深地信靠神；往往也是在受苦时，我们才被迫认真地读经、才真正走进基督徒群体、学会向别人求助。

然而，他也强调：苦难本身并不会自动带来智慧——它既可能使人走向更深的谦卑、勇气与恩典，也可能使人变得更骄傲、更怯懦、更苦毒。关键在于：当苦难临到时，我们心中是否仍然相信“自己是神所爱的儿女，祂在基督里喜悦我”。如果没有这一点，苦难就容易把人推向硬心、绝望或自义；若有这一点，苦难反倒成为使人柔软、成熟、有智慧的火炉。

在这一小段里，凯勒继续展开“苦难如何成为智慧的催化剂”，并把焦点放在“我们在苦难中必须抓住的那一件事”：

他说，要在苦难中仍然被塑造成谦卑、勇敢、恩慈的人，我们必须确信：在这些苦难之中，上帝仍然“喜悦我们、以我们为乐”。经文说：“耶和华所爱的，他必责备，正如父亲责备所喜爱的儿子。”

他指出，一个真正爱孩子的父亲，在管教孩子时，并不是为了发泄情绪，也不是为了毁掉孩子，而是为了塑造他、使他成熟。看到孩子哭，父亲的心也会痛；但出于爱，他仍然愿意承受这种痛，以便让孩子在长远上得益处。

同样地，当神让苦难临到我们时，如果我们把它理解为“神嫌弃我、抛弃我”，苦难就会让我们变得更硬心、更苦毒、更绝望；但如果我们在十字架的光中看见：那位为我们舍命的神，既然已经为我们做到那一步，就绝不会在真正对我们有益的事上亏待我们——那么，在苦难之中，我们就能说：“这虽然痛苦，却不是惩罚我、要我毁掉，而是出于祂的爱和喜悦。”这样的信心，会让苦难成为炼净我们、使我们更有智慧的火炉，而不是把我们推入黑暗的深渊。

接着，凯勒引用《希伯来书》12 章对《箴言》3:11–12 的应用：“我儿，你不可轻看主的管教，被他责备的时候也不可灰心；因为主所爱的，他必管教，又鞭打凡所收纳的儿子。”在这一段经文附近，希伯来书又说：“仰望为我们信心创始成终的耶稣；他因那摆在前面的喜乐，就轻看羞辱，忍受了十字架的苦难，便坐在神宝座的右边。”

凯勒说，这就是关键：我们要如何在苦难中确信“自己是蒙爱的儿女”？不是盯着环境，也不是盯着自己的表现，而是“仰望耶稣”——特别是看见祂在十字架上为我们承受的一切。

他提醒我们：当耶稣受洗时，圣灵仿佛鸽子从天降下，有声音说：“这是我的爱子，我所喜悦的。”然而，当祂在十字架上时，却呼喊：“我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？”——那是祂唯一一次没有称呼神为“父”，而是叫“我的神”。这是因为，当时祂正为我们承担“被弃绝”的命运：祂在十字架上，经历了我们原本应得的离弃与审判，好叫我们因信靠祂而被收纳为神的儿女。

约翰福音 1:12 说，“凡接待他的，就是信他名的人，他就赐他们权柄，作神的儿女。”罗马书 8:16 说，“圣灵与我们的心同证我们是神的儿女。”——换句话说，因为耶稣在十字架上“失去”了儿子的地位，凡信靠祂的人如今被“收纳”为儿女，并且可以在圣灵的见证中听见：“你是我所爱的孩子，我在基督里喜悦你。”

当我们在苦难中回望十字架，看到这位为我们舍命的救主，我们就能确信：那位不会连自己的儿子都不爱惜、反而为我们众人舍了的神，也必然在一切事上与我们同在。这样的确信，会重新“叙述”我们的人生——让我们不再只是把苦难看作无意义的灾难，而是看作神爱中管教与塑造的一部分。

在这一小段的收尾，凯勒强调十字架对于我们在苦难中持守信心、增长智慧的决定性意义。

他指出：如果神从未受苦，我们就很难在自己的苦难中信靠祂——我们可能会说：“祂又不懂我经历什么。”但基督教独特地宣称：神自己在基督里进入人类历史，亲身受苦，甚至受到了极致的羞辱和弃绝。因此，当我们在苦难中仰望十字架时，我们看到的不是一位“高高在上、不懂人间痛苦的神”，而是一位进入我们痛苦、为我们承担终极苦难的救主。

凯勒说：当你看见耶稣在十字架上的受苦，你就能说：“若祂肯为我做到这一切，祂绝不会在真正对我有益的事上亏待我。”这会深深地改变你看待一切遭遇的方式——你的困难不再只是“倒霉的事故”，而是被放入一个新的叙事中：那位为你舍命的主，正在用这些事来塑造你，使你如金子在火中被炼净，如钻石在压力下被造就。

他用一个充满画面感的比喻来总结：当你在苦难中“安息在耶稣里”，看见祂为你所做的一切，你就会发现，你的苦难与心的关系，就好像“火之于金子、压力之于钻石”——它不会把你毁掉，反而让你成为一个更有重量、更有光泽的人。

于是，他以祷告作结：“父啊，我们不只是想要成为有智慧的人，我们更想要像基督——因为在祂里面，藏着一切智慧和知识的宝藏。求你帮助我们常常注目基督的十字架，看见在那里你已经证明你喜悦我们，好叫我们在生命的起伏中，持续认识你、信靠你、顺服你的话语，并活在基督徒群体中，越来越多地被塑造成你儿子的模样。阿们。”

借着这样的结尾，他把整篇讲道串联起来：从“日常选择塑造品格、品格决定智慧”，到“四条日常路径”（认识神、信靠神、顺服话语、活在群体），再到“苦难如何涡轮增压这一切”，最后以十字架为中心，告诉我们：真正持久的智慧，是在注目基督、活在福音故事中，被神一步步塑造出来的。

这一小段是整篇讲道关于“苦难与智慧”部分的总结和深化。

凯勒指出：

1）苦难是不可避免的，每个人都会在某个时刻遇到；
2）苦难本身既可能推动你走向智慧，也可能把你推向愚昧；
3）关键在于：你在苦难中，相信“神对你的态度”是什么。

他强调，要让苦难成为“通向智慧的路”，而不是“通向苦毒的路”，你必须确信：在苦难之中，神仍然“喜悦你、以你为乐”。经文说：“耶和华所爱的，他必责备，正如父亲责备所喜爱的儿子。”

一个真正爱孩子的父亲，在管教时，会允许一些痛苦、困难临到孩子——这会让孩子哭，让孩子觉得不好受。但父亲这么做，并不是要毁掉孩子，而是要塑造他、让他成熟。父亲自己看见孩子难过，心里也会痛；但出于爱，他仍然愿意承受这种痛。

同样地，当神容许苦难临到我们时，如果我们看不见十字架，就很难相信“这是出于爱”。我们很容易解读为：“神在惩罚我、抛弃我。”若是这样，苦难就会把我们推向硬心、绝望、自怜和愤怒。

但十字架改变了一切：

– 在十字架上，那个原本从永恒里就听见“这是我的爱子，我所喜悦的”的耶稣，却喊出：“我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？”这是祂唯一一次没有称呼神为“父”，而是叫“我的神”。

– 这是因为，祂正在替我们承担“被弃绝”的命运——祂被赶出家门，叫我们可以被接纳进家；祂失去儿子的地位，叫我们可以被收纳为儿女。

– 约翰福音 1:12 说，“凡接待他的，就是信他名的人，他就赐他们权柄，作神的儿女。”

– 罗马书 8:16 说，“圣灵与我们的心同证我们是神的儿女。”

换句话说，因为耶稣在十字架上被离弃，我们在祂里被收纳；因为祂在那里听不见“这是我的爱子，我所喜悦的”，我们如今在圣灵里可以听见那句话向我们说：“你在我眼中是宝贵、是所爱的。”

当你在苦难中牢牢抓住十字架，知道那位为你舍命的神不可能弃你不顾，你就能确信：哪怕现在非常痛苦，这一切也不再是“惩罚性的刑罚”，而是“爱中带着目的的管教”。

凯勒说，当你这样看苦难时，它们对你心的作用，就好像“火之于金子、压力之于钻石”：不是要把你烧毁、压碎，而是要炼净你、塑造你，使你成为一个有重量、有光泽的人。于是，他以祷告作结：求神使我们在所有高山低谷中，都因注目基督的十字架，而更加认识祂、信靠祂、顺服祂的话语，并活在群体中，渐渐被塑造成祂儿子的模样。

本段是对前面关于“苦难如何涡轮增压其他属灵操练”的继续解释与总结。

凯勒说：当苦难临到时，它要么推动我们走向更大的谦卑、勇气和恩典，要么把我们推向骄傲、怯懦和苦毒。有人在受苦中变得非常骄傲，自觉“比别人更高尚”，觉得别人不懂自己的痛苦，从而轻视别人；也有人被苦难压碎，变得极度害怕任何风险，不再愿意面对任何困难；还有人因为苦难变得极其愤怒与怨恨。

因此，要让苦难成为通往智慧的催化剂，而不是通往愚昧的催化剂，关键就在于：在苦难中，我们是否确信“神仍然喜悦我们、以我们为乐”。如果我们相信自己在苦难中被神抛弃了，就会愈发硬心、苦毒、自怜、绝望；但若我们在十字架的光下确信：“那位为我舍命的主，不会在真正对我有益的事上亏待我”，那么苦难就会成为炼净我们的火炉，逼着我们更深入地祷告、更真实地信靠神、更加渴慕神的话语、更加依靠基督徒群体——从而在各方面加速我们走向智慧。

凯勒提醒说：

– 你若想真正认识自己、知道自己的强弱，需要被试炼；
– 你若想在安慰和帮助受伤的人方面变得有智慧、有技巧，必须自己也曾受伤过，否则你常常会在不知不觉中“越帮越糟”；
– 你若想在任何风浪中都稳妥地信靠神、确信祂在你这边，往往只有在“几乎要被水淹没”的时刻，你才真正学会信靠祂。

他总结说：苦难本身不会自动让人变好，但在福音的光中被解读的苦难，会像火炼金那样，使你成为更纯净、更有智慧的人。

在这一小段里，凯勒更直接地把我们的目光引向十字架，说明：为什么只有福音，才能让我们在苦难中确信“自己是蒙爱的儿女”。

他引用《希伯来书》12 章对《箴言》3:11–12 的应用：“我儿，你不可轻看主的管教，被他责备的时候也不可灰心；因为主所爱的，他必管教，又鞭打凡所收纳的儿子。”紧接着经文又说：“仰望为我们信心创始成终的耶稣。他因那摆在前面的喜乐，就轻看羞辱，忍受了十字架的苦难，便坐在神宝座的右边。”

凯勒提醒我们：

– 当耶稣受洗时，圣灵降临在祂身上，天父的声音宣告：“这是我的爱子，我所喜悦的。”

– 在祂地上的整个事工中，每当祂向神祷告时，几乎总是称呼“父啊”（Father）：祂教门徒祷告时，教他们说“我们在天上的父”；祂在客西马尼园，也祷告说“父啊”。

– 然而，当祂挂在十字架上时，却呼喊：“我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？”这是福音书中唯一一次祂没有称神为“父”，而是叫“我的神”。

这意味着什么？凯勒说，那一刻，耶稣正在为我们承担“被弃绝”的命运。祂被当作罪人来对待，承受我们本该承受的离弃与审判，好叫凡信靠祂的人可以被接纳为神的儿女。

约翰福音 1:12 说，“凡接待他的，就是信他名的人，他就赐他们权柄，作神的儿女。”罗马书 8:16 说，“圣灵与我们的心同证我们是神的儿女。”——也就是说，因为耶稣在十字架上失去了“儿子的地位”，我们如今在祂里面被收纳为儿女，并且可以在圣灵的见证中听见：“你是我所爱的孩子，我喜悦你。”

当我们在苦难中仰望十字架，看到耶稣为我们受的苦，如此清楚地证明了神对我们的爱与喜悦，我们就能确信：现在临到我们的苦难，不再是“刑罚性的审判”，而是“出于父爱、有目的的管教”。这种确信，会极大地改变我们如何解读自己的遭遇，从而决定苦难到底会把我们推向智慧，还是推向愚昧。

在最后这一小段里，凯勒用极富画面感的方式，把整篇讲道收束在十字架与智慧的主题上。

他说：当你在苦难中“安息在耶稣里”，看见祂在十字架上为你所做的，你就会发现，你的苦难与心的关系，就像“火之于金子、压力之于钻石”——它不会把你毁掉，反而会炼净你、塑造你，使你成为一个更有重量、更有光泽的人。

他提醒会众：

– 我们不只是想成为“有智慧的人”，更是想成为“像基督的人”；

– 因为在基督里，藏着“一切智慧和知识的宝藏”；

– 因此，真正的智慧，不在于掌握多少技巧，而在于越来越多地被塑造成基督的样式。

于是，他以祷告作结，大意是：

“父啊，我们想要成为有智慧的人，但更想要像你的儿子耶稣——因为在祂里面，藏着所有智慧和知识的宝藏。求你帮助我们，常常注目耶稣在十字架上为我们所做的一切，好叫我们在生命起伏的每一个阶段，都能更深地认识你、信靠你、顺服你的话语，并与我们的弟兄姊妹一同活在真实的群体里。求你使用一切发生在我们生命中的事，尤其是苦难，来塑造我们，使我们越来越像你的儿子。奉祂的名祷告，阿们。”

至此，整篇《如何得到智慧》（Wisdom: How To Get It）的讲道就完整结束：

– 从“生命是道路、日常小选择塑造品格”，
– 到“四条日常路径”（认识神、信靠神、顺服话语、活在群体），
– 再到“苦难如何涡轮增压这一切”，
– 最后以十字架为中心，指出：真正持久的智慧，是在福音的故事中、在注目基督的过程中，被神一步步塑造出来的。
