## English Transcript / 英文原文

today's teaching, Tim Keller looks at how the Bible's teaching on sin gives us a deeply  honest and yet incredibly hopeful view of the world. I'd like to read to you our text on which the teaching is based this morning. It's Jeremiah chapter 2. We began looking at this chapter last week. This is the first of Jeremiah's sermons to the people of Judah.

It's on the subject of sin, and we looked at the first part of the chapter and the sermon  last week, and we look at the rest this week. Jeremiah 2 verses 19 to 32. Your wickedness will punish you. Your backsliding will rebuke you. Consider then and realize how evil and bitter it is for you when you forsake the Lord your  God and have no all of me declares the Lord, the Lord Almighty.

Long ago you broke off your yoke and tore off your bonds. You said, I will not serve you. Indeed, on every high hill and under every spreading tree you lay down as a prostitute. I had planted you like a choice of wine of sound and reliable stock. How then did you turn against me into a corrupt wild vine?

Although you wash yourself with soda and use an abundance of soap, the stain of your guilt  is still before me declares the Lord, the sovereign Lord. How can you say, I am not the Filed, I have not run after the Bales. See how you behaved in the valley, consider what you have done. You are a swift she camel running here and there, a wild donkey accustomed to the desert, sniffing  the wind in her craving, in her heat who can restrain her, and emails that pursue her  need not tire themselves at mating time they will find her. Do not run until your feet are bare and your throat is dry, but you said, it's no use,  I love foreign gods, and I must go after them.

As a thief is disgraced when he is caught, so the house of Israel is disgraced. They, their kings and their officials, their priests and their prophets, they say to wood,  you are my father, and to stone, you gave me birth. They have turned their backs to me and not their faces yet, when they are in trouble they  say, come and save us. Where then are the gods you made for yourselves? Let them come if they can save you when you are in trouble.

For you have as many gods as you have towns, O Judah. Why do you bring charges against me? You have all rebelled against me to clear the Lord. In vain I punished your people, they did not respond to correction. Your sword is devoured your prophets like a ravening lion.

You of this generation consider the word of the Lord. Have I been a desert to Israel or a land of great darkness? Why do my people say we are free to roam? We will come to you no more. Does a maiden forget her jewelry, a bride, her wedding ornaments?

Yet my people have forgotten me, days without number. This is God's word. Now we started looking at this last week. This is a very modern situation into which Jeremiah is speaking because his country, his society  was literally falling apart. It was falling apart politically and it was falling apart psychologically and socially and  culturally.

Everybody was asking what's wrong and the answer of the sermon, the answer of God through  Jeremiah was, it's not the economy stupid, it's sin. He began, we looked at this last week, first talking about the character of sin. The character of sin that we saw last week is beautifully summed up in a little statement  by Dorothy Sayers in which she defined sin as a deep interior dislocation of the soul. A deep interior dislocation of the soul, it's a wonderful little phrase. When a hip or a bone of any sort is dislocated, what is that?

What's the problem? It's off center. It's not centered at the spot it should be. And as a result, there's tremendous, tremendous havoc, the muscles, the tissue, there's  all this cutting and grinding you see and there's tremendous damage being done and it's in pain. Your hip doesn't work, you can't walk, you can't move, you can't move your arm.

Sin is a dislocation of the soul. The soul should be centered on God. If there is a God, we saw last week, if there is a God, then he'd be the great  creator and everything in our life should revolve around him, should center on him. But we said sin is the demand of the heart that everything, including God, revolve around  me, my happiness, my goals, my agenda, what makes me comfortable. That's sin, a dislocation of the soul and all of our problems come from our unwillingness  to center on him because we do not want to lose control.

Whatever we center on controls us. So we say, we have no awe of him, we don't center on him now. That was last week, the character sin, today we're going to look at the consequences. What actually happens? What are the effects?

What are the things that actually happen when we do that? And the effects, of course, are terribly drastic. You see, right here in the beginning of this marvelous passage, it says, God says, your wickedness  will punish you. Your backsliding will rebuke you. You see that?

Look. He says, I won't have to do it. Your wickedness will punish you. Your backsliding will rebuke you. When you tell a child, don't play with the toy that way or it'll break.

You know, the child loves the toy. Dear, don't do that. You're breaking the rules and you'll break the toy. What if the child continues to sin against what you said? The child continues to do differently than what he was told and the toy breaks.

And he's in tears. What does the parent do? You don't have anything else you have to do. He brought the punishment. His wickedness punished him.

His backsliding rebuked him, you see. It already happened. There's not much else you have to do because you see, he is saying in verse 19, sin brings  its own consequences. If you disobey the word of God, the Bible says, that will be enough. You'll break your heart.

You'll break your life. You'll break your relationships. You'll break your soul. Terrible consequences. Now, what are those consequences?

How do we break things? How does everything fall apart? Things fall apart. Says the novel. That's right.

Because it's sin. Now, what are the consequences? There are actually two in this particular passage. There's two that are mentioned. And they're mentioned under a wonderful image, a wonderful new metaphor.

And that metaphor is this. God in a penetrating way says that sin leads us to fall in love with other gods. In other words, we have lover gods. We have gods. We have idols with whom we fall in love with.

We have lover gods. And those lover gods will always do two things. They'll always have two effects on us. They will enslave us and they will leave us empty. They will enslave us and they will leave us empty.

Now, let's take a look at that. They will enslave us and leave us empty. Your lover gods, on the one hand, they bring about a bondage. And on the other hand, they bring about radical disappointment, complete emptiness. First of all, verse 23, 24 and 25, how can you say, I am not defiled.

I have not run after the bails. See, the bails are idols. See how you behaved in the valley. Consider what you've done. You're a swifty camel running here and there, a wild dunkey accustomed to the desert, sniffing  the wind in her craving in her heat, who can restrain her.

Any males that pursue her need not tire themselves at mating times, they will find her. Do not run until your feet are bare and your throat is dry, but you said, it's no use. I love foreign gods. I must go after them. What do we learn here?

It is an image that God uses to these desert dwellers who understood animals very well. They lived with the animals. Their livelihood depended on their animals. Their lives depended on the animals. And here's one thing they knew, that when an animal got into the mating season, there  was no stopping that animal.

The picture is of an animal in the grip of craving, in the grip of a foundational instinct. No stopping that animal. What are we learning here? The first thing we learn is it's sort of a general thing, under this subject of slavery. First of all, sin has a power to enslave that we hide from ourselves.

You notice? God says, in the beginning, you say, I am not defiled. There's nothing wrong with me, but in the end of that two verses, do you see what he says? It's no use. I must go after them.

And the first thing we're being taught here is that sin brings a slavery. Sin has a power over you. That you will, in the beginning, in the beginning, you'll say, it's not true. I'm not defiled. This isn't a problem.

This isn't a problem. But in the end, you'll say, it's no use. If you deny the power of sin in your life, eventually you'll be brought to despair. See, take a look. It says, how can I say, how can you say, I am not defiled?

There was a time magazine article back in August, I think it was the August 15th edition. And it was on adultery and fidelity. And here was the point of the magazine article. The point of the article was to say, you know what? Marriage doesn't fit us.

We are not built to be faithful to one person all of our lives. It's not natural. Now what's behind that? Behind the scholarship. You know what I hear?

I hear a guy wanting to break a promise to his wife. He made many years ago to be faithful and saying, you know, I'm not defiled. It's just not natural. It's just the way I am. Marriage doesn't fit me.

I am not defiled. I'm not in the power of sin as I'm now breaking my promise. I'm not in the grip of a lust. Oh no, it's just as I'm just being true to who I am. God says, if you deny the power sin early on in your life, rationalizing it, saying,  I am not defiled.

In the end, you'll be brought to despair. Can't you see this? Can't you see the power sin in your life? Listen, you who are married, you should certainly know. You know, before you get married, you're continually told by people about your faults.

You're told that you're picky or you're sensitive or you're obsessive or you're kind  of a coward here or you're anxious or you're kind of selfish or you have a trouble with  your temper or you tend to hold grudges. And over the years, you've seen these things and people have pointed them out to you, but  you've always said, I am not defiled. That's not such a big problem. I could change if I really had to and then you get married. If there's anybody in this room who ought to know about the power of sin, it should be  the people who are married who have been married.

Why don't you know? You should know why. These things create problems for you and you see how strong they are. You say, okay, honey, I'll change and you're right back into it. How many times you don't have to be married to see this?

You make your resolutions. You say, I'll never do that again. And you do it. I won't lose my temper the way I used to. I won't stay in this habit.

I won't give into fears. You sink your sincere. You are sincere and you can't stop. The power of sin in your life, Paul says, the apostle Paul. He says, the good that I would, I do not.

And that which I would not, I do. Are you more compassionate than Paul? Are you more have more integrity than Paul? Are you more of a self-sense, a self-sacrifice than Paul? Are you a better person than Paul?

But he admits it. Can't you see it? If you start out denying it, I'm not defiled, you'll end up saying it's no use. Eventually you'll see that there is a power in you that is beyond you. You can spend a lot of time rationalizing it.

You can take courses in both psychology and sociology to do everything to redefine sin  in such a way that we're able to say we're not defiled, but in the end we'll say it's  no use. But here's what's so interesting about these three verses. It doesn't just tell us that sin is an enslaving power, but it tells us why. And the reason it tells us, this is fascinating. God tells us that the reason that we are under the power of sin is because, listen, sin  is a fatal attraction.

Sin is a fatal attraction. But you say it's no use, I love foreign gods, I must go after them. Now, what is a fatal attraction? You know, the movie, of course, gave us the term, but we've always known about it. A fatal attraction is when a man or woman gets obsessed with someone that you'll do anything.

You'll lie, you'll steal, you'll kill, anything. And we all say, ah, of course, that's obsessive, that there's something wrong there. That person has taken something and made it so important that it's more important than  anything else, any principle, anything, ah, we're not like that. And God says that's not true. God says every human being has a fatal attraction to something.

Every human being has lover gods, every human being has a bottom line. Every human being has something that you live for, that you say, I must have that. And whatever you say, I must have that about. That's your lover, that's your God, that's the thing that you rely on. That's the thing that has total control over you.

Total control. Now, you see, when he talks about the bales and the foreign gods, he says, ah, this is, this is,  this is real, these are primitive. Well, you see in Romans chapter one, this is the fundamental to the biblical analysis of the human condition. Romans chapter one, God says, all of us, because we will not center on God,  because we would not glorify God, we worship created things rather than the creature,  and we worship and serve them. Now, what is Paul saying?

He's not talking just about ancients, you know, polytheists, animists. He's talking about all of us. And he's saying this. Didn't we say that the character sin was, we refuse to center on God. We refuse to put God in the center.

So what do we do? We have to put something in the center. You have to have something there, but whatever you have, because your center was shaped for God,  because as people continually say, there's a God-shaped hole in you, whatever you put in there,  whatever you make your bottom line, whatever you make your meaning in life,  whatever you make the thing that you must have, whatever it is,  because you put it in God's place, it becomes a God. You can't just like your bottom line. You can't just like the central value of your life.

You are fatally attracted to it. You will do anything to get it, anything. Lover gods, you see. Farring gods, I must go after them. This is a very, very profound analysis.

I hope you see it in every way. Now, somebody says, not wait a minute. What are you talking about? Anything you live for, power or approval or control, or needing to be needed,  or independence, you see, or achievement or work, or romance,  or a personal relationship, or relationships in general,  or one relationship in particular, or the way you look. But everybody's got something that they say,  this is the one in whom's arms I put myself.

This is the one in whom I rest. This is the one who I say, if I have you, then I'll be happy. But I must have you. That's what we're talking about. Now, somebody says, well, listen, I can sort of see this would be true of some people.

I know of obsessed of people. I have heard of fatal attractions. And I also know of religious people, but not me. I'm skeptical. I'm totally skeptical.

I believe in no absolute values of any sort. I'm a complete relativist. I'm totally independent. I believe that I have to create my own reality. You see, therefore I serve nothing.

But that's not true. Your skepticism, look at it. Your skepticism is the one thing you won't question. I can prove it to you. If you really were skeptical of your skepticism, you wouldn't be so skeptical.

I can prove it to you. And look more carefully. Look more carefully. It's the thing you rely on. It's how you face life.

It's the thing that, by which you judge everything else,  it's the thing that you're facing life with. It's the thing that makes you feel good about yourself. It's the thing, look carefully. You have bet your eternal destiny on it. You can't prove there's no God.

And yet you have bet your entire destiny. Oh, my friends, we all have lover gods. We've all got bottom lines. We've all got ultimate concerns. We've all got the things that we say, it's no use.

I must have this. And that's the way you can tell what they are. I got to move on here because you see the first point is you're enslaved. We're enslaved, you know, the power is sin. But why, why are we enslaved?

Because anything that you put in the place where God  should be becomes a God. Anything except the true God, about which you say,  I must have it, becomes a fatal attraction. George McDonald, the old Scottish writers put it this way,  anything that you cannot part with it need is your ruler. Think of that one. Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache.

We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way? And what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing this month,  what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer.

Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer,  Dr. Keller shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us  and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world,  struggling with your own mistakes or choices,  or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world  will help you see how the gospel speaks  to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us. This newly released book, What Is Wrong with the World,  is our thanks for your gift this month  to help gospel and life share the good news of Jesus.

That's gospelandlife.com slash give. Test yourself for a minute. For example, is there anything that if you would lose it,  you would say, I actually talked about this under a different  guys two weeks ago, did we know? Anything that you look at, you say, if I don't have this  or if I lose this or if I fail to get it,  I die, I have nothing to live for. I must have it.

Anything but the true God that you say that about  is more important than God. Anything, what would you ditch God for? Some of you in the past half haven't you? What would you say if God does this to me,  if God lets this happen, then I want nothing to do with God,  whatever that would be, would be more important than God  and would be your God, right? What drives you?

What is it about what you say  if I do not have this, I cannot receive life joyfully? The word must. If you use it about anything but God,  you're under the power of that thing. Right, look at the bottom, look at your depression,  look at your disappointments,  look at your anger, look at your worry. And instead of saying, how can I change my circumstances,  you have to say, look, the reason I'm so worried,  the reason I'm petrified, the reason I'm so discouraged,  is because there's something about which I am saying,  I must have it.

That's why having these emotions. It's at the bottom of everything. The bondage of sin, your idle gods,  your lover gods will always leave you and slay,  but secondly, they will always leave you empty. Look at this passage. Secondly, they will always leave you empty.

Down here verse 27,  they say to wood, you are my father,  and to stone you gave me birth. They have turned their backs to me and not their faces. Yet when they are in trouble, they say, come and save us. Where then are the gods you have made for yourselves? Let them come if they can and save you when you're in trouble.

For you have as many gods as you have towns. Oh, Judah, now what do we learn here? Your lover gods will always leave you empty. Where are the gods when you're in trouble? And let me actually, if you and don't look,  just listen to this.

Just a couple of chapters later,  Jeremiah is preaching again in chapter 4 verse 30. He says the same thing,  but he says it in such a pointy way. He says to his people,  he says, what are you doing a waste of devastated ones? Why dress yourself in scarlet and put on jewels of gold? Why shade your eyes with paint?

You adorn yourself in vain. Your lover's despise you. They seek your life. And what's the teaching here? The teaching is if there's anything in your life about which you say,  besides God, about which you say, I must have this to receive life joyfully.

It controls you. That's the first point, but the second point is  you will never satisfy that lover. Never. Here's what God is saying. Ah, you devastated ones.

Why do you shade your eyes with paint? Why do you deck yourselves with jewels? Your lovers will never be satisfied. They despise your life. They despise you and they seek your life.

You will never satisfy them. I saw a book review about Irving Berlin's life. Irving Berlin. Oh, an awful lot of good songs. His daughter said the trouble was, no matter how much he achieved,  as soon as he achieved something,  he immediately would fall into kind of discouragement.

He says, I'll never be able to do that again. I'll never be able to write a song like that one. The achievement God will never be satisfied. It doesn't matter. You say, if only I get to this level of achievement,  then my lover God will say,  you're acceptable.

You've made it. It will never say that. Never. They despise you. How about the thinness God?

You know, some people have an extreme example of it. It's called eating disorders. But you know what? You'll never, you'll never, ever, ever satisfy the thinness God. You ever read interviews with supermodels.

How they hate the fact that there's, you know,  a half an inch bump on the backside of their, of their, you know,  their shoulder blade. And they just say, there's something wrong with me. You'll never satisfy any of these things. The work God,  when you pick up a child,  newborn and you're the parent,  don't you dare look into its eyes and say,  I will live for this. This is it now.

I've got meaning in life. One of the most awful things about all those stories  about babies having babies,  you know, all the little girls to say,  I want to have this baby. And why? Then I'll have somebody to love. Then I'll have something to live for.

I have nothing in my life. My dear friends,  your children at some time,  even when things go pretty well in children. At some point, your children will despise you. You can't live for that. Now, here's the power of an idol.

They say to wood. They say to stone. Now, the idol makers do not create wood and stone. They take wood and stone and create an idol out of it. See, here's the subtlety.

Here's the power of an idol. They're good things. There's nothing wrong with wood. There's nothing wrong with stone. It's what you do with it.

There's nothing wrong with children. There's nothing wrong with,  with trying to take care of your appearance. There's nothing wrong with work. There's nothing wrong with achievement. See, they're good things.

That's why they're so powerful. God made them good things. They're good in themselves. They have a power of goodness in them. That's really where a lot of their power comes from.

But when you put them,  where only God should go,  when you set them, where only God should go,  it's what you've made out of them  that exhorts an enormous power over you. But they will never be satisfied. Never. What do you want from these? You deck yourself for them.

You say, if only. I mean, why do you work so hard? Why are some of you so driven in so many different ways? You want these idol guys to say something that they never will say. You want them to say,  well done, good and faithful servant.

Enter into the joy of your master. Here's my arms open for you. Come in. You are completely acceptable to me. Never, never.

They say,  you could do better. They always do. And listen, if you want to really see,  Jeremiah says, God says,  if you want to really see  how absolutely bankrupt and how absolutely empty your gods will leave you,  don't test your religion. Don't test your religion when the sun is shining. When you're in trouble, call on your gods.

How can they help you then? You see, an awful lot of you still are out there saying,  you know, I don't know what you're talking about. I have no problems like this. I don't feel, I don't see any fatal attraction in my life. You see, wait till the trouble comes.

Call on your gods then. I'm going to give you three examples. False gods will never help you. These lover gods will never help you in three situations. Three, okay?

Really bad sickness. Bereavement and death and failure, they'll never do it. Look, for example, what if you're really sick? What if you get really sick for a long term or permanently? You're on your back.

There's no God except the true God that can help you there. Are you living for material possessions? Are you living for achievement? Are you living for physical beauty? Are you living for relationships?

So what are you living for? If you become permanently on your back,  every one of those gods will have to desert you. They can't help you with thing there. Only the real God could. Well, you say that may not happen to me.

You're going to get old. Call on your gods then. None of them will come through but the true God. None of them will be able to bring you through. Let's take a look at death.

What do you mean by death? You say, well, I mean this. What if you have a great marriage? What if your spouse is the meaning of your life? What if your spouse is what gives you your joy?

Somebody's going to have to die first. It's something that Kathy and I every so often look at. And we say, you know what? Unless some strange, strange, strange, incredible quincidence,  one of the other is going to be left behind. And if we make, if either of us make the other one our God,  how can our God help us when it's in the casket?

Call on your gods then. The gods that you have made for yourself. Good things that you've turned into. Gods, they will never help you then. Then you'll see.

Then you'll see. You may not know that these are your lover gods  until the sickness comes. Until the death, let me give you one more. Failure, failure. My dear friends, people are continually saying to me,  you know, I guess I know God forgives me, but I failed here.

I failed as a parent. I failed as a spouse. I failed as an employee. I haven't made the grade. I did something wrong.

I can't forgive myself. It sounds so humble, but you know what you mean? I have a God you mean. Higher than the God. Because the fact that the Bible says God forgives me doesn't really see.

I put something over God and now that thing won't forgive me. You know why idols never forgive, never. If the thing you're living for is your work. If the thing you're living for is money. If the thing you're living for is relationships.

If the thing you're living for is morality. I have people coming saying I'm very religious, but I blew it. And now I can't forgive myself. I've gone to Jesus and I know he forgives me, but I can't forgive myself. Then morality is your idol, God.

It's Christianity is your God, not Christ. Religion will never forgive you. No God will ever forgive you. Except the true God. They won't.

They despise you. They seek your life. Call on your gods. The gods that you have made for yourself in time of trouble. And you will see if you can't forgive yourself.

It's because you've got a God higher than God. And no God but God will ever forgive you. Don't you see these things can't help you. I mean if moral achievement is the thing that you're living for,  how can it help you when it's gone? If relationships are the thing you're living for,  how can they help you when they're gone?

Don't you see that? They can never help you in death. They can never help you in failure. They can never help you in sickness and suffering. You know why?

Because they don't exist. They're an extension of yourself. They're an extension of your will, the power. You see they have no life in them. They're just stuck.

They're just stone. They'll never help you when your heart is broken. And if you cannot find any comfort when your heart is broken,  it's because there's something more God than God in your life. Now lastly,  all right. These things leave you enslaved and they leave you empty.

Well how can we be healed? Wonderful. Look at the very end. Verse 31, hear the word of the Lord. Have I been a desert to Israel?

Oh look at this. Look at this. Have I been a desert to Israel or a land of great darkness? Why do my people say we are free to roam? We will come to you no more.

Does a maiden forget her jewelry? Does a bride forget her wedding ornaments? Yet my people have forgotten me. Days without number. Now look here.

Look. What is God saying? He says, listen. Have you ever seen a bride coming down the aisle saying,  oh my gosh, I forgot to put on makeup? Have you ever seen a bride come down the aisle saying,  oh my gosh, you know, I forgot to wear my earrings?

They don't do that. Well maybe, maybe that one. But you know, they don't forget things like that. They don't forget this why. A bride does an awful lot of work  to be as absolutely beautiful as she possibly can be.

And by the way, it's all, I mean,  I've never seen a bride who failed. Never. Never. There's all sorts of ways to hide the parts of you  that's not that attractive. All sorts of ways to highlight the parts of you that are  and you come down looking like a vision  and everybody in the whole auditorium wants to marry you.

Why do you work so hard for that to happen? Because what you want, you're thinking about them  but basically you're thinking about him  and you're coming down to your lover  and you want him to say,  I opened to you. You're so beautiful. I accept you completely. All the barriers are down.

You have complete access. Well done. Enter into my joy. God says, you know how to make yourself acceptable physically  but you don't understand how to do it spiritually. You know why you're working so hard?

You know why you're going after these. You know why you're trying so hard to be pretty. You know why you're trying so hard to be successful. You know why you're trying so hard for these things  for power and for approval and for you're trying to cover your nakedness. You're trying to cover over the sense of inadequacy we all have, right?

You're trying very hard to get someone to say I accept you. Don't you understand? I can be your ornament. I can be your righteousness. I can be your acceptability.

I can do it. Now I don't know what Jeremiah thought. God was talking about. He had a general understanding of it  but we have a specific understanding of it. In chapter five of Ephesians we read,  husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church  and gave himself up for her to make her wholly  cleansing her so as to present her to himself  radiant without stain or wrinkle or any blemish  wholly and blameless.

How does Jesus Christ make you what you've been trying to make yourself  all of your life by going after these lover gods? How does he do it? You know how he does it? He gave herself every other God that despises you and seeks your life. But this God gave, he doesn't seek your life, he gave his life.

This is a God who on the cross was stripped so you could be clothed. He was naked in the dark so that you could be clothed in the light. You see? He was disfigured so you could be beautiful. He was cast out so someone to the Father could say,  well done.

Good and faithful servant. When we believe in him,  all of his great work on the cross becomes ours. His righteousness becomes ours. That's what the Bible says. That's how God can say here,  I don't know how they understood it but we understand it now.

Does a bride forget her ornaments? Does a bride forget her beauty? You have forgotten me. I can be your beauty. Here you are out running around desperately trying to look great,  to get your lover gods, to get others around you to say,  well done, good and faithful servant,  to you're trying to clothe yourself with righteousness so you can never do it.

I and I alone can do it. Do you see what's going on? Do you see what he's saying? A bride forgets, would a bride forget her wedding dress, but you've forgotten me. The most astonishing thing.

When you ever look at anything and say, I must have you. If I don't have that, I die and some of you are doing that right now. That's the reason why you're so discouraged. When you say that, you have completely forgotten or you've never heard of what Jesus did  on the cross for you. He was stripped naked so that you could be clothed.

He's your jewelry. He's that which makes you beautiful. Yes, why God says, am I a desert to you? You don't see what I've done for you. You don't see what I can be to you.

So here's what I say. What you've got to do. Look, I'm not listening. I'm not trying to prove the Christianity is true. I'm just trying to show you there's not even another religion that claims to have a god like this.

Every other god in every other religion, every other god in every other philosophy,  every other god says, do this and you will live. Fail and you will die. We have the only god who says, fail and I will die for you. There's no other religion. Other religions say our god is too great to have died.

Our religion says our god is so great that he died. Every other god seeks your life. This god gives his life for you. I'm not trying to prove the Christianity is true. There's ways of giving the evidence.

I'm just trying to say this is the only religion that even claims to have a god like that. As the great poem goes, other gods were strong but thou was weak. They rode but thou distumble to the throne. And two are wounds only gods wounds can speak. And no god has wounds but thou alone.

The only god that even claims to have wounds. The only god that even claims to give himself for you. Here's what you need to do when you're distressed. Instead of just saying, why am I so distressed? Why does god let this happen to me?

Realize the reason you're so distressed is because there's things about what you're saying. I must have them. Then turn away and say, wait a minute. I don't have to have them. The only thing I have to have is Jesus Christ who is my ornament.

I don't have to use these things to clothe my sense of inadequacy. He's my beauty and he's my righteousness. In other words, say to him what the last, you know the stanza. Oh, you remember the chorus of that hymn? In other words, say, I will arise and go to Jesus.

He will embrace me in his arms. In the arms of my dear Savior, there are 10,000 charms. Don't forget him. Let's pray. Father, as we offer ourselves to you now, we're beginning to see  that things that we looked at in our lives as inexplicable pain and difficult misery  and unexplainable distress.

We're starting to see how it all fits together. It's because the other things that we've gone after besides you,  the things that we've centered our life on,  instead of you, they despise us. They seek our life. We're trying to get them to say, well done. They never will be satisfied.

We will arise. We will go to Jesus. He will embrace us. And there we'll find true rest. We thank you that in him we are radiant, spotless, without staying or wrinkle.

Father, those of us who are here who know this but we're not living it,  we pray that you give us the power to live it and face the weak with it. Those of us here who don't understand this yet,  I pray that you would get after them and they would never give up until they understand it  and rejoice in it as the central fact of their life. And we ask this in Jesus' name.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today's teaching, Tim Keller looks at how the Bible's teaching on sin gives us a deeply  honest and yet incredibly hopeful view of the world. I'd like to read to you our text on which the teaching is based this morning. It's Jeremiah chapter 2. We began looking at this chapter last week. This is the first of Jeremiah's sermons to the people of Judah.

It's on the subject of sin, and we looked at the first part of the chapter and the sermon  last week, and we look at the rest this week. Jeremiah 2 verses 19 to 32. Your wickedness will punish you. Your backsliding will rebuke you. Consider then and realize how evil and bitter it is for you when you forsake the Lord your  God and have no all of me declares the Lord, the Lord Almighty.

Long ago you broke off your yoke and tore off your bonds. You said, I will not serve you. Indeed, on every high hill and under every spreading tree you lay down as a prostitute. I had planted you like a choice of wine of sound and reliable stock. How then did you turn against me into a corrupt wild vine?

Although you wash yourself with soda and use an abundance of soap, the stain of your guilt  is still before me declares the Lord, the sovereign Lord. How can you say, I am not the Filed, I have not run after the Bales. See how you behaved in the valley, consider what you have done. You are a swift she camel running here and there, a wild donkey accustomed to the desert, sniffing  the wind in her craving, in her heat who can restrain her, and emails that pursue her  need not tire themselves at mating time they will find her. Do not run until your feet are bare and your throat is dry, but you said, it's no use,  I love foreign gods, and I must go after them.

As a thief is disgraced when he is caught, so the house of Israel is disgraced. They, their kings and their officials, their priests and their prophets, they say to wood,  you are my father, and to stone, you gave me birth. They have turned their backs to me and not their faces yet, when they are in trouble they  say, come and save us. Where then are the gods you made for yourselves? Let them come if they can save you when you are in trouble.

For you have as many gods as you have towns, O Judah. Why do you bring charges against me? You have all rebelled against me to clear the Lord. In vain I punished your people, they did not respond to correction. Your sword is devoured your prophets like a ravening lion.

You of this generation consider the word of the Lord. Have I been a desert to Israel or a land of great darkness? Why do my people say we are free to roam? We will come to you no more. Does a maiden forget her jewelry, a bride, her wedding ornaments?

Yet my people have forgotten me, days without number. This is God's word. Now we started looking at this last week. This is a very modern situation into which Jeremiah is speaking because his country, his society  was literally falling apart. It was falling apart politically and it was falling apart psychologically and socially and  culturally.

Everybody was asking what's wrong and the answer of the sermon, the answer of God through  Jeremiah was, it's not the economy stupid, it's sin. He began, we looked at this last week, first talking about the character of sin. The character of sin that we saw last week is beautifully summed up in a little statement  by Dorothy Sayers in which she defined sin as a deep interior dislocation of the soul. A deep interior dislocation of the soul, it's a wonderful little phrase. When a hip or a bone of any sort is dislocated, what is that?

What's the problem? It's off center. It's not centered at the spot it should be. And as a result, there's tremendous, tremendous havoc, the muscles, the tissue, there's  all this cutting and grinding you see and there's tremendous damage being done and it's in pain. Your hip doesn't work, you can't walk, you can't move, you can't move your arm.

Sin is a dislocation of the soul. The soul should be centered on God. If there is a God, we saw last week, if there is a God, then he'd be the great  creator and everything in our life should revolve around him, should center on him. But we said sin is the demand of the heart that everything, including God, revolve around  me, my happiness, my goals, my agenda, what makes me comfortable. That's sin, a dislocation of the soul and all of our problems come from our unwillingness  to center on him because we do not want to lose control.

Whatever we center on controls us. So we say, we have no awe of him, we don't center on him now. That was last week, the character sin, today we're going to look at the consequences. What actually happens? What are the effects?

What are the things that actually happen when we do that? And the effects, of course, are terribly drastic. You see, right here in the beginning of this marvelous passage, it says, God says, your wickedness  will punish you. Your backsliding will rebuke you. You see that?

Look. He says, I won't have to do it. Your wickedness will punish you. Your backsliding will rebuke you. When you tell a child, don't play with the toy that way or it'll break.

You know, the child loves the toy. Dear, don't do that. You're breaking the rules and you'll break the toy. What if the child continues to sin against what you said? The child continues to do differently than what he was told and the toy breaks.

And he's in tears. What does the parent do? You don't have anything else you have to do. He brought the punishment. His wickedness punished him.

His backsliding rebuked him, you see. It already happened. There's not much else you have to do because you see, he is saying in verse 19, sin brings  its own consequences. If you disobey the word of God, the Bible says, that will be enough. You'll break your heart.

You'll break your life. You'll break your relationships. You'll break your soul. Terrible consequences. Now, what are those consequences?

How do we break things? How does everything fall apart? Things fall apart. Says the novel. That's right.

Because it's sin. Now, what are the consequences? There are actually two in this particular passage. There's two that are mentioned. And they're mentioned under a wonderful image, a wonderful new metaphor.

And that metaphor is this. God in a penetrating way says that sin leads us to fall in love with other gods. In other words, we have lover gods. We have gods. We have idols with whom we fall in love with.

We have lover gods. And those lover gods will always do two things. They'll always have two effects on us. They will enslave us and they will leave us empty. They will enslave us and they will leave us empty.

Now, let's take a look at that. They will enslave us and leave us empty. Your lover gods, on the one hand, they bring about a bondage. And on the other hand, they bring about radical disappointment, complete emptiness. First of all, verse 23, 24 and 25, how can you say, I am not defiled.

I have not run after the bails. See, the bails are idols. See how you behaved in the valley. Consider what you've done. You're a swifty camel running here and there, a wild dunkey accustomed to the desert, sniffing  the wind in her craving in her heat, who can restrain her.

Any males that pursue her need not tire themselves at mating times, they will find her. Do not run until your feet are bare and your throat is dry, but you said, it's no use. I love foreign gods. I must go after them. What do we learn here?

It is an image that God uses to these desert dwellers who understood animals very well. They lived with the animals. Their livelihood depended on their animals. Their lives depended on the animals. And here's one thing they knew, that when an animal got into the mating season, there  was no stopping that animal.

The picture is of an animal in the grip of craving, in the grip of a foundational instinct. No stopping that animal. What are we learning here? The first thing we learn is it's sort of a general thing, under this subject of slavery. First of all, sin has a power to enslave that we hide from ourselves.

You notice? God says, in the beginning, you say, I am not defiled. There's nothing wrong with me, but in the end of that two verses, do you see what he says? It's no use. I must go after them.

And the first thing we're being taught here is that sin brings a slavery. Sin has a power over you. That you will, in the beginning, in the beginning, you'll say, it's not true. I'm not defiled. This isn't a problem.

This isn't a problem. But in the end, you'll say, it's no use. If you deny the power of sin in your life, eventually you'll be brought to despair. See, take a look. It says, how can I say, how can you say, I am not defiled?

There was a time magazine article back in August, I think it was the August 15th edition. And it was on adultery and fidelity. And here was the point of the magazine article. The point of the article was to say, you know what? Marriage doesn't fit us.

We are not built to be faithful to one person all of our lives. It's not natural. Now what's behind that? Behind the scholarship. You know what I hear?

I hear a guy wanting to break a promise to his wife. He made many years ago to be faithful and saying, you know, I'm not defiled. It's just not natural. It's just the way I am. Marriage doesn't fit me.

I am not defiled. I'm not in the power of sin as I'm now breaking my promise. I'm not in the grip of a lust. Oh no, it's just as I'm just being true to who I am. God says, if you deny the power sin early on in your life, rationalizing it, saying,  I am not defiled.

In the end, you'll be brought to despair. Can't you see this? Can't you see the power sin in your life? Listen, you who are married, you should certainly know. You know, before you get married, you're continually told by people about your faults.

You're told that you're picky or you're sensitive or you're obsessive or you're kind  of a coward here or you're anxious or you're kind of selfish or you have a trouble with  your temper or you tend to hold grudges. And over the years, you've seen these things and people have pointed them out to you, but  you've always said, I am not defiled. That's not such a big problem. I could change if I really had to and then you get married. If there's anybody in this room who ought to know about the power of sin, it should be  the people who are married who have been married.

Why don't you know? You should know why. These things create problems for you and you see how strong they are. You say, okay, honey, I'll change and you're right back into it. How many times you don't have to be married to see this?

You make your resolutions. You say, I'll never do that again. And you do it. I won't lose my temper the way I used to. I won't stay in this habit.

I won't give into fears. You sink your sincere. You are sincere and you can't stop. The power of sin in your life, Paul says, the apostle Paul. He says, the good that I would, I do not.

And that which I would not, I do. Are you more compassionate than Paul? Are you more have more integrity than Paul? Are you more of a self-sense, a self-sacrifice than Paul? Are you a better person than Paul?

But he admits it. Can't you see it? If you start out denying it, I'm not defiled, you'll end up saying it's no use. Eventually you'll see that there is a power in you that is beyond you. You can spend a lot of time rationalizing it.

You can take courses in both psychology and sociology to do everything to redefine sin  in such a way that we're able to say we're not defiled, but in the end we'll say it's  no use. But here's what's so interesting about these three verses. It doesn't just tell us that sin is an enslaving power, but it tells us why. And the reason it tells us, this is fascinating. God tells us that the reason that we are under the power of sin is because, listen, sin  is a fatal attraction.

Sin is a fatal attraction. But you say it's no use, I love foreign gods, I must go after them. Now, what is a fatal attraction? You know, the movie, of course, gave us the term, but we've always known about it. A fatal attraction is when a man or woman gets obsessed with someone that you'll do anything.

You'll lie, you'll steal, you'll kill, anything. And we all say, ah, of course, that's obsessive, that there's something wrong there. That person has taken something and made it so important that it's more important than  anything else, any principle, anything, ah, we're not like that. And God says that's not true. God says every human being has a fatal attraction to something.

Every human being has lover gods, every human being has a bottom line. Every human being has something that you live for, that you say, I must have that. And whatever you say, I must have that about. That's your lover, that's your God, that's the thing that you rely on. That's the thing that has total control over you.

Total control. Now, you see, when he talks about the bales and the foreign gods, he says, ah, this is, this is,  this is real, these are primitive. Well, you see in Romans chapter one, this is the fundamental to the biblical analysis of the human condition. Romans chapter one, God says, all of us, because we will not center on God,  because we would not glorify God, we worship created things rather than the creature,  and we worship and serve them. Now, what is Paul saying?

He's not talking just about ancients, you know, polytheists, animists. He's talking about all of us. And he's saying this. Didn't we say that the character sin was, we refuse to center on God. We refuse to put God in the center.

So what do we do? We have to put something in the center. You have to have something there, but whatever you have, because your center was shaped for God,  because as people continually say, there's a God-shaped hole in you, whatever you put in there,  whatever you make your bottom line, whatever you make your meaning in life,  whatever you make the thing that you must have, whatever it is,  because you put it in God's place, it becomes a God. You can't just like your bottom line. You can't just like the central value of your life.

You are fatally attracted to it. You will do anything to get it, anything. Lover gods, you see. Farring gods, I must go after them. This is a very, very profound analysis.

I hope you see it in every way. Now, somebody says, not wait a minute. What are you talking about? Anything you live for, power or approval or control, or needing to be needed,  or independence, you see, or achievement or work, or romance,  or a personal relationship, or relationships in general,  or one relationship in particular, or the way you look. But everybody's got something that they say,  this is the one in whom's arms I put myself.

This is the one in whom I rest. This is the one who I say, if I have you, then I'll be happy. But I must have you. That's what we're talking about. Now, somebody says, well, listen, I can sort of see this would be true of some people.

I know of obsessed of people. I have heard of fatal attractions. And I also know of religious people, but not me. I'm skeptical. I'm totally skeptical.

I believe in no absolute values of any sort. I'm a complete relativist. I'm totally independent. I believe that I have to create my own reality. You see, therefore I serve nothing.

But that's not true. Your skepticism, look at it. Your skepticism is the one thing you won't question. I can prove it to you. If you really were skeptical of your skepticism, you wouldn't be so skeptical.

I can prove it to you. And look more carefully. Look more carefully. It's the thing you rely on. It's how you face life.

It's the thing that, by which you judge everything else,  it's the thing that you're facing life with. It's the thing that makes you feel good about yourself. It's the thing, look carefully. You have bet your eternal destiny on it. You can't prove there's no God.

And yet you have bet your entire destiny. Oh, my friends, we all have lover gods. We've all got bottom lines. We've all got ultimate concerns. We've all got the things that we say, it's no use.

I must have this. And that's the way you can tell what they are. I got to move on here because you see the first point is you're enslaved. We're enslaved, you know, the power is sin. But why, why are we enslaved?

Because anything that you put in the place where God  should be becomes a God. Anything except the true God, about which you say,  I must have it, becomes a fatal attraction. George McDonald, the old Scottish writers put it this way,  anything that you cannot part with it need is your ruler. Think of that one. Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache.

We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way? And what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing this month,  what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer.

Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer,  Dr. Keller shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us  and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world,  struggling with your own mistakes or choices,  or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world  will help you see how the gospel speaks  to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us. This newly released book, What Is Wrong with the World,  is our thanks for your gift this month  to help gospel and life share the good news of Jesus.

That's gospelandlife.com slash give. Test yourself for a minute. For example, is there anything that if you would lose it,  you would say, I actually talked about this under a different  guys two weeks ago, did we know? Anything that you look at, you say, if I don't have this  or if I lose this or if I fail to get it,  I die, I have nothing to live for. I must have it.

Anything but the true God that you say that about  is more important than God. Anything, what would you ditch God for? Some of you in the past half haven't you? What would you say if God does this to me,  if God lets this happen, then I want nothing to do with God,  whatever that would be, would be more important than God  and would be your God, right? What drives you?

What is it about what you say  if I do not have this, I cannot receive life joyfully? The word must. If you use it about anything but God,  you're under the power of that thing. Right, look at the bottom, look at your depression,  look at your disappointments,  look at your anger, look at your worry. And instead of saying, how can I change my circumstances,  you have to say, look, the reason I'm so worried,  the reason I'm petrified, the reason I'm so discouraged,  is because there's something about which I am saying,  I must have it.

That's why having these emotions. It's at the bottom of everything. The bondage of sin, your idle gods,  your lover gods will always leave you and slay,  but secondly, they will always leave you empty. Look at this passage. Secondly, they will always leave you empty.

Down here verse 27,  they say to wood, you are my father,  and to stone you gave me birth. They have turned their backs to me and not their faces. Yet when they are in trouble, they say, come and save us. Where then are the gods you have made for yourselves? Let them come if they can and save you when you're in trouble.

For you have as many gods as you have towns. Oh, Judah, now what do we learn here? Your lover gods will always leave you empty. Where are the gods when you're in trouble? And let me actually, if you and don't look,  just listen to this.

Just a couple of chapters later,  Jeremiah is preaching again in chapter 4 verse 30. He says the same thing,  but he says it in such a pointy way. He says to his people,  he says, what are you doing a waste of devastated ones? Why dress yourself in scarlet and put on jewels of gold? Why shade your eyes with paint?

You adorn yourself in vain. Your lover's despise you. They seek your life. And what's the teaching here? The teaching is if there's anything in your life about which you say,  besides God, about which you say, I must have this to receive life joyfully.

It controls you. That's the first point, but the second point is  you will never satisfy that lover. Never. Here's what God is saying. Ah, you devastated ones.

Why do you shade your eyes with paint? Why do you deck yourselves with jewels? Your lovers will never be satisfied. They despise your life. They despise you and they seek your life.

You will never satisfy them. I saw a book review about Irving Berlin's life. Irving Berlin. Oh, an awful lot of good songs. His daughter said the trouble was, no matter how much he achieved,  as soon as he achieved something,  he immediately would fall into kind of discouragement.

He says, I'll never be able to do that again. I'll never be able to write a song like that one. The achievement God will never be satisfied. It doesn't matter. You say, if only I get to this level of achievement,  then my lover God will say,  you're acceptable.

You've made it. It will never say that. Never. They despise you. How about the thinness God?

You know, some people have an extreme example of it. It's called eating disorders. But you know what? You'll never, you'll never, ever, ever satisfy the thinness God. You ever read interviews with supermodels.

How they hate the fact that there's, you know,  a half an inch bump on the backside of their, of their, you know,  their shoulder blade. And they just say, there's something wrong with me. You'll never satisfy any of these things. The work God,  when you pick up a child,  newborn and you're the parent,  don't you dare look into its eyes and say,  I will live for this. This is it now.

I've got meaning in life. One of the most awful things about all those stories  about babies having babies,  you know, all the little girls to say,  I want to have this baby. And why? Then I'll have somebody to love. Then I'll have something to live for.

I have nothing in my life. My dear friends,  your children at some time,  even when things go pretty well in children. At some point, your children will despise you. You can't live for that. Now, here's the power of an idol.

They say to wood. They say to stone. Now, the idol makers do not create wood and stone. They take wood and stone and create an idol out of it. See, here's the subtlety.

Here's the power of an idol. They're good things. There's nothing wrong with wood. There's nothing wrong with stone. It's what you do with it.

There's nothing wrong with children. There's nothing wrong with,  with trying to take care of your appearance. There's nothing wrong with work. There's nothing wrong with achievement. See, they're good things.

That's why they're so powerful. God made them good things. They're good in themselves. They have a power of goodness in them. That's really where a lot of their power comes from.

But when you put them,  where only God should go,  when you set them, where only God should go,  it's what you've made out of them  that exhorts an enormous power over you. But they will never be satisfied. Never. What do you want from these? You deck yourself for them.

You say, if only. I mean, why do you work so hard? Why are some of you so driven in so many different ways? You want these idol guys to say something that they never will say. You want them to say,  well done, good and faithful servant.

Enter into the joy of your master. Here's my arms open for you. Come in. You are completely acceptable to me. Never, never.

They say,  you could do better. They always do. And listen, if you want to really see,  Jeremiah says, God says,  if you want to really see  how absolutely bankrupt and how absolutely empty your gods will leave you,  don't test your religion. Don't test your religion when the sun is shining. When you're in trouble, call on your gods.

How can they help you then? You see, an awful lot of you still are out there saying,  you know, I don't know what you're talking about. I have no problems like this. I don't feel, I don't see any fatal attraction in my life. You see, wait till the trouble comes.

Call on your gods then. I'm going to give you three examples. False gods will never help you. These lover gods will never help you in three situations. Three, okay?

Really bad sickness. Bereavement and death and failure, they'll never do it. Look, for example, what if you're really sick? What if you get really sick for a long term or permanently? You're on your back.

There's no God except the true God that can help you there. Are you living for material possessions? Are you living for achievement? Are you living for physical beauty? Are you living for relationships?

So what are you living for? If you become permanently on your back,  every one of those gods will have to desert you. They can't help you with thing there. Only the real God could. Well, you say that may not happen to me.

You're going to get old. Call on your gods then. None of them will come through but the true God. None of them will be able to bring you through. Let's take a look at death.

What do you mean by death? You say, well, I mean this. What if you have a great marriage? What if your spouse is the meaning of your life? What if your spouse is what gives you your joy?

Somebody's going to have to die first. It's something that Kathy and I every so often look at. And we say, you know what? Unless some strange, strange, strange, incredible quincidence,  one of the other is going to be left behind. And if we make, if either of us make the other one our God,  how can our God help us when it's in the casket?

Call on your gods then. The gods that you have made for yourself. Good things that you've turned into. Gods, they will never help you then. Then you'll see.

Then you'll see. You may not know that these are your lover gods  until the sickness comes. Until the death, let me give you one more. Failure, failure. My dear friends, people are continually saying to me,  you know, I guess I know God forgives me, but I failed here.

I failed as a parent. I failed as a spouse. I failed as an employee. I haven't made the grade. I did something wrong.

I can't forgive myself. It sounds so humble, but you know what you mean? I have a God you mean. Higher than the God. Because the fact that the Bible says God forgives me doesn't really see.

I put something over God and now that thing won't forgive me. You know why idols never forgive, never. If the thing you're living for is your work. If the thing you're living for is money. If the thing you're living for is relationships.

If the thing you're living for is morality. I have people coming saying I'm very religious, but I blew it. And now I can't forgive myself. I've gone to Jesus and I know he forgives me, but I can't forgive myself. Then morality is your idol, God.

It's Christianity is your God, not Christ. Religion will never forgive you. No God will ever forgive you. Except the true God. They won't.

They despise you. They seek your life. Call on your gods. The gods that you have made for yourself in time of trouble. And you will see if you can't forgive yourself.

It's because you've got a God higher than God. And no God but God will ever forgive you. Don't you see these things can't help you. I mean if moral achievement is the thing that you're living for,  how can it help you when it's gone? If relationships are the thing you're living for,  how can they help you when they're gone?

Don't you see that? They can never help you in death. They can never help you in failure. They can never help you in sickness and suffering. You know why?

Because they don't exist. They're an extension of yourself. They're an extension of your will, the power. You see they have no life in them. They're just stuck.

They're just stone. They'll never help you when your heart is broken. And if you cannot find any comfort when your heart is broken,  it's because there's something more God than God in your life. Now lastly,  all right. These things leave you enslaved and they leave you empty.

Well how can we be healed? Wonderful. Look at the very end. Verse 31, hear the word of the Lord. Have I been a desert to Israel?

Oh look at this. Look at this. Have I been a desert to Israel or a land of great darkness? Why do my people say we are free to roam? We will come to you no more.

Does a maiden forget her jewelry? Does a bride forget her wedding ornaments? Yet my people have forgotten me. Days without number. Now look here.

Look. What is God saying? He says, listen. Have you ever seen a bride coming down the aisle saying,  oh my gosh, I forgot to put on makeup? Have you ever seen a bride come down the aisle saying,  oh my gosh, you know, I forgot to wear my earrings?

They don't do that. Well maybe, maybe that one. But you know, they don't forget things like that. They don't forget this why. A bride does an awful lot of work  to be as absolutely beautiful as she possibly can be.

And by the way, it's all, I mean,  I've never seen a bride who failed. Never. Never. There's all sorts of ways to hide the parts of you  that's not that attractive. All sorts of ways to highlight the parts of you that are  and you come down looking like a vision  and everybody in the whole auditorium wants to marry you.

Why do you work so hard for that to happen? Because what you want, you're thinking about them  but basically you're thinking about him  and you're coming down to your lover  and you want him to say,  I opened to you. You're so beautiful. I accept you completely. All the barriers are down.

You have complete access. Well done. Enter into my joy. God says, you know how to make yourself acceptable physically  but you don't understand how to do it spiritually. You know why you're working so hard?

You know why you're going after these. You know why you're trying so hard to be pretty. You know why you're trying so hard to be successful. You know why you're trying so hard for these things  for power and for approval and for you're trying to cover your nakedness. You're trying to cover over the sense of inadequacy we all have, right?

You're trying very hard to get someone to say I accept you. Don't you understand? I can be your ornament. I can be your righteousness. I can be your acceptability.

I can do it. Now I don't know what Jeremiah thought. God was talking about. He had a general understanding of it  but we have a specific understanding of it. In chapter five of Ephesians we read,  husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church  and gave himself up for her to make her wholly  cleansing her so as to present her to himself  radiant without stain or wrinkle or any blemish  wholly and blameless.

How does Jesus Christ make you what you've been trying to make yourself  all of your life by going after these lover gods? How does he do it? You know how he does it? He gave herself every other God that despises you and seeks your life. But this God gave, he doesn't seek your life, he gave his life.

This is a God who on the cross was stripped so you could be clothed. He was naked in the dark so that you could be clothed in the light. You see? He was disfigured so you could be beautiful. He was cast out so someone to the Father could say,  well done.

Good and faithful servant. When we believe in him,  all of his great work on the cross becomes ours. His righteousness becomes ours. That's what the Bible says. That's how God can say here,  I don't know how they understood it but we understand it now.

Does a bride forget her ornaments? Does a bride forget her beauty? You have forgotten me. I can be your beauty. Here you are out running around desperately trying to look great,  to get your lover gods, to get others around you to say,  well done, good and faithful servant,  to you're trying to clothe yourself with righteousness so you can never do it.

I and I alone can do it. Do you see what's going on? Do you see what he's saying? A bride forgets, would a bride forget her wedding dress, but you've forgotten me. The most astonishing thing.

When you ever look at anything and say, I must have you. If I don't have that, I die and some of you are doing that right now. That's the reason why you're so discouraged. When you say that, you have completely forgotten or you've never heard of what Jesus did  on the cross for you. He was stripped naked so that you could be clothed.

He's your jewelry. He's that which makes you beautiful. Yes, why God says, am I a desert to you? You don't see what I've done for you. You don't see what I can be to you.

So here's what I say. What you've got to do. Look, I'm not listening. I'm not trying to prove the Christianity is true. I'm just trying to show you there's not even another religion that claims to have a god like this.

Every other god in every other religion, every other god in every other philosophy,  every other god says, do this and you will live. Fail and you will die. We have the only god who says, fail and I will die for you. There's no other religion. Other religions say our god is too great to have died.

Our religion says our god is so great that he died. Every other god seeks your life. This god gives his life for you. I'm not trying to prove the Christianity is true. There's ways of giving the evidence.

I'm just trying to say this is the only religion that even claims to have a god like that. As the great poem goes, other gods were strong but thou was weak. They rode but thou distumble to the throne. And two are wounds only gods wounds can speak. And no god has wounds but thou alone.

The only god that even claims to have wounds. The only god that even claims to give himself for you. Here's what you need to do when you're distressed. Instead of just saying, why am I so distressed? Why does god let this happen to me?

Realize the reason you're so distressed is because there's things about what you're saying. I must have them. Then turn away and say, wait a minute. I don't have to have them. The only thing I have to have is Jesus Christ who is my ornament.

I don't have to use these things to clothe my sense of inadequacy. He's my beauty and he's my righteousness. In other words, say to him what the last, you know the stanza. Oh, you remember the chorus of that hymn? In other words, say, I will arise and go to Jesus.

He will embrace me in his arms. In the arms of my dear Savior, there are 10,000 charms. Don't forget him. Let's pray. Father, as we offer ourselves to you now, we're beginning to see  that things that we looked at in our lives as inexplicable pain and difficult misery  and unexplainable distress.

We're starting to see how it all fits together. It's because the other things that we've gone after besides you,  the things that we've centered our life on,  instead of you, they despise us. They seek our life. We're trying to get them to say, well done. They never will be satisfied.

We will arise. We will go to Jesus. He will embrace us. And there we'll find true rest. We thank you that in him we are radiant, spotless, without staying or wrinkle.

Father, those of us who are here who know this but we're not living it,  we pray that you give us the power to live it and face the weak with it. Those of us here who don't understand this yet,  I pray that you would get after them and they would never give up until they understand it  and rejoice in it as the central fact of their life. And we ask this in Jesus' name.

在今天的信息中，提姆·凯勒将探讨：圣经关于罪的教导如何使我们对这个世界既极其诚实、又充满不可思议的盼望。今天早上我想把作为本次讲道依据的经文读给大家听。这段经文出自耶利米书第二章。我们上周已经开始查考这一章；这是耶利米向犹大百姓所讲的第一篇信息。

这篇信息的主题是罪。上周我们看了本章和这篇讲论的前半部分，这周我们来看剩下的部分。耶利米书2章19到32节：“你的恶必惩罚你；你的背道必责备你。你当知道，当思想：你离弃耶和华你的　神，不存敬畏我的心，是何等恶而且苦！这是主——万军之耶和华说的。

“古时你折断你的轭，解开你的绳索；你说：‘我必不事奉！’其实你在各高冈上、各青翠树下，屈身行淫。我栽你作上等葡萄树，全然是真种；你怎么向我变为外邦葡萄树的坏枝子呢？

“你虽用碱洗濯自己，多用肥皂，你罪孽的污迹仍然在我面前——这是主耶和华说的。你怎能说：‘我没有玷污；我没有随从诸巴力。’你且看你在山谷里所行的，思想你所做的。你像快跑的母骆驼，往来奔走；又像惯在旷野的野驴，发情的时候嗅风；她欲心发动，谁能拦阻她呢？追赶她的公驴不必疲乏；到交配的时候必能寻见她。你不要跑到脚上赤露、喉咙干渴；你却说：‘没用！我喜爱外邦神，我必须随从他们。’

“贼被捉住怎样羞愧，以色列家也必照样羞愧——他们和他们的君王、首领、祭司并先知，都说木头：‘你是我的父；’对石头说：‘你生了我。’他们向我转背，不转脸；及至遭难的时候，却说：‘起来拯救我们！’你为自己制造的神在哪里呢？让他们起来吧；你遭难的时候，若能拯救你，就让他们拯救你。”

“犹大啊，你有多少城邑，就有多少神明。你们为什么向我争辩呢？你们都背叛了我——这是耶和华说的。‘我责打你们的儿女是徒然的；他们不受管教。你们的刀剑吞灭你们的先知，好像残暴的狮子。’

“你们这世代的人哪，要留心耶和华的话！我岂向以色列作过旷野，或作过幽暗之地吗？为什么我的百姓说：‘我们自由了，可以随意飘荡；我们不再到你这里来了’？少女岂能忘记她的饰物，新妇岂能忘记她的婚嫁妆饰呢？

“然而我的百姓却忘记了我，日子无数。”这是上帝的话。

我们上周已经开始看这段经文了。耶利米所面对的处境非常现代，因为他的国家、他的社会确实在瓦解：政治上在瓦解，心理上、社会上、文化上也在瓦解。

人人都在问：到底出了什么问题？而这篇讲道的答案——也就是上帝借着耶利米给出的答案——是：不是“经济的问题，笨蛋”，而是罪。

他一开始（我们上周已看过）先谈罪的性质。我们上周所看到的罪的性质，被多萝西·塞耶斯的一句简洁的话概括得极美：她把罪定义为“灵魂深处的内在错位”。“灵魂深处的内在错位”——这是个精彩的短语。比如髋关节或任何骨头发生脱臼，那是什么？

问题在哪里？它偏离了中心——不再位于它本该在的位置。于是就造成巨大的、巨大的破坏：肌肉、组织，都在被拉扯、摩擦、碾磨，带来严重的损伤，并且痛得要命。你的髋部不能正常工作，你不能走路，不能行动；你的手臂也抬不起来。

罪，是灵魂的错位。灵魂本该以上帝为中心。我们上周讲过：如果真有一位上帝，那么祂就是伟大的创造主，我们生命中的一切都应该围绕祂转，都该以祂为中心。但我们说，罪就是人心的要求：让一切——连上帝也包括在内——都围绕着“我”转，围绕我的幸福、我的目标、我的计划、那些让我舒服的东西转。这就是罪：灵魂的错位；我们所有的问题都出自我们不愿以祂为中心，因为我们不想失去控制。

我们把什么当作中心，什么就控制我们。所以我们说，我们对祂没有敬畏，我们现在不再以祂为中心。那是上周讲的——罪的本质；今天我们要看它的后果：到底会发生什么？影响是什么？

当我们这样做时，究竟会发生哪些事呢？这些影响当然极其严重。你看，就在这段奇妙经文的开头这里，上帝说：“你的邪恶必惩罚你；你的背道必责备你。”你看见了吗？

你看。祂说：我都不必亲自来做。“你的邪恶必惩罚你；你的背道必责备你。”这就像你对孩子说：“别那样玩玩具，不然会弄坏的。”

你知道，孩子很喜欢那个玩具。“亲爱的，别这样。你是在破坏规矩，你会把玩具弄坏的。”如果孩子继续违背你说的话呢？孩子继续按自己想法去做，结果玩具坏了。

他就哭得一塌糊涂。父母要做什么？其实你不需要再做别的。他把惩罚带到了自己身上——他的邪恶惩罚了他。

他的背道责备了他，你明白吗？事情已经发生了。你也没有太多别的可做，因为你看，祂在第19节说：罪会带来它自己的后果。若你违背上帝的话语，圣经说，那本身就够了。你会把自己的心弄碎。

你会毁掉你的生活，毁掉你的人际关系，毁掉你的灵魂。可怕的后果。那么，这些后果是什么？

我们是怎样把东西弄坏的？一切又是怎样崩塌的？“万事崩解。”小说里这样说。没错。

因为这就是罪。那么，它的后果是什么呢？在这段经文里，其实有两个后果。这里提到了两个，并且是借着一个很精彩的图像、一个很新的隐喻来说明的。

这个隐喻就是：神以一种直指人心的方式说，罪会引我们去爱上别的神。换句话说，我们会有“情人神”。我们会有神。我们会有我们爱上的偶像。

我们有“情人神”。而这些“情人神”总是会对我们做两件事，总是会带来两种效果：它们会奴役我们，也会使我们空虚。它们会奴役我们，也会使我们空虚。

现在我们来看看这一点：它们会奴役我们，并使我们空虚。你的“情人神”一方面带来捆绑，另一方面带来彻底的失望——完全的空虚。首先看第23、24、25节：“你怎能说：我没有被玷污？

我没有随从众巴力。”你看，巴力就是偶像。“你当看你在山谷中所行的，思想你所做的。你像敏捷的母骆驼在这里那里乱跑；像惯在旷野的野驴，在欲火中随风嗅气；谁能使她转回呢？凡寻找她的必不至疲乏；在她发情的月分必能寻见她。

你不要使脚上无鞋，喉咙干渴。”你却说：“这是枉然！我喜爱外邦的神，我必须随从他们。”我们从这里学到什么？

这是神对这些住在旷野、很懂动物的人所用的一个图像。他们与动物为伍；他们的生计靠着动物；他们的生活也系于动物。他们知道一件事：当动物进入发情期时，是拦不住的。

这幅画面描绘的是一只动物被欲望攫住，被一种根本性的本能攫住——没有任何东西能阻止它。我们在这里学到什么？我们首先学到的，是在“奴役”这个主题下一个比较普遍的点：首先，罪有一种使人作奴仆的能力，而我们往往把这一点对自己隐藏起来。

你们注意到了吗？神说，一开始你会说：“我没有被玷污。 我没有什么问题。”但在那两节经文的末尾，你看他怎么说？“没有用的。我非去追随他们不可。”

我们在这里学到的第一件事是：罪会带来一种奴役。罪在你身上有权势。你会——起初，起初——说：“不是这样的。我没有被玷污。这不成问题。”

“这不成问题。”但到了最后，你会说：“没有用的。”如果你否认罪在你生命中的权势，最终你会被带到绝望里。你看——仔细看看。经文说：“我怎能说……你怎能说：‘我没有被玷污’呢？”

我记得《时代》杂志在八月有一篇文章，大概是8月15日那期，谈的是通奸与忠诚。那篇文章的要点是什么呢？它要说的是：你知道吗？婚姻并不适合我们。

我们并不是被造来一生只对一个人忠诚的；那不自然。那背后是什么？背后是所谓的“学术研究”。你知道我听见的是什么吗？

我听见的是：一个男人想要撕毁他多年前对妻子所立的忠诚承诺，于是说：“你看，我没有被玷污。这只是不自然。这就是我的样子。婚姻不适合我。”

“我没有被玷污。我现在背弃誓言，并不是在罪的权势之下；我并不是被情欲抓住了。哦不，我只是忠于真正的自己。”神说：如果你在人生早期就否认罪的权势，为它辩解、合理化，说：“我没有被玷污。”

到最后，你必被带到绝望里。你还看不见吗？你还看不见罪在你生命中的权势吗？听着——你们已婚的人，当然更该知道。你知道，结婚以前，人们不断告诉你关于你的各种缺点。

有人说你挑剔、敏感、强迫、在某些方面有点胆怯，或者焦虑，或者有点自私，或者脾气控制有问题，或者容易记仇。多年下来，你自己也看见这些，人们也指出过这些，但你总是说：“我没有被玷污。这没什么大不了的。如果我真需要，我是可以改的。”然后你就结婚了。要是这屋里有谁应该最明白罪的权势，那就该是那些已婚、并且结婚有一段时间的人。

你为什么还不明白？你应该明白为什么。这些东西给你带来麻烦，你也看见它们有多强。你会说：“好吧，亲爱的，我会改的。”可你马上又回到老样子里。你都不需要结婚多少次就能看到这一点。

你下决心，你说：“我再也不那样做了。”可你还是照做。“我不会像以前那样发脾气了。我不会再停留在这个习惯里。”

“我不会再向恐惧屈服。”你是真诚的，你也确实想改，可你停不下来。你生命里罪的权势——使徒保罗说：“我所愿意的善，我反不去做；我所不愿意的恶，我倒去做。”

你比保罗更有怜悯吗？你比保罗更正直吗？你比保罗更有自知、更愿意自我牺牲吗？你比保罗更好吗？

可他承认这一点。你难道看不见吗？如果你一开始就否认——“我没有被玷污”——你最后就会说：“没用的。”最终你会发现，你里面有一种权势，远远超过你自己。你可以花很多时间为它辩解。

你可以去上心理学、社会学的课程，用尽办法把“罪”重新定义到一个地步，使我们能够说“我们没有被玷污”；但到最后，我们还是会说：“没用的。”但这三节经文里有一件非常有意思的事：它不只是告诉我们罪是一种奴役人的权势，它还告诉我们为什么。而它给出的原因很耐人寻味。神告诉我们：我们之所以落在罪的权势之下，是因为——听着——罪具有一种致命的吸引力。

罪是一种致命的吸引力。但你说：没用的，我爱外邦的神，我必须追随它们。那什么叫“致命的吸引力”呢？当然，这个词后来因那部电影而流行起来，但其实我们一直都知道这种现象。所谓致命的吸引力，就是男人或女人对某个人着了迷，以至于你愿意做任何事。

你会撒谎，你会偷窃，你会杀人，什么都做。我们都会说：啊，当然，那是痴迷，是不正常的。那个人把某样东西抓住，把它变得如此重要，以至于它比任何别的东西都重要——比任何原则、比任何其他事都重要。啊，我们可不是那样。可上帝说：这不是真的。上帝说，每一个人都对某样东西有一种致命的吸引。

每一个人都有自己所恋慕的“神”，每一个人都有自己的底线。每一个人都有你为之而活的东西，你会说：我必须拥有那个。而你所说“我必须拥有”的那样东西，就是你的情人，就是你的神；那就是你所倚靠的东西。那就是对你有完全控制力的东西。

完全的控制。现在你看，当他谈到巴力和外邦的神时，你会说：啊，这是真的，这些很原始。但你看《罗马书》第一章，这正是圣经对人类处境分析的根基。《罗马书》第一章里，上帝说，我们所有人，因为不愿以神为中心，因为不愿荣耀神，就去敬拜受造之物，而不是敬拜造物主，并且敬拜、事奉它们。现在，保罗在说什么？

他不只是在讲古代人——你知道的，多神论者、泛灵论者。他是在讲我们所有人。他是在说：我们不是说过，罪这个“性格特征”是什么吗？就是我们拒绝以神为中心。我们拒绝把神放在中心。

那么我们该怎么办？我们必须把某样东西放在中心。你的生命中心一定会有东西在那里；但无论你放什么进去——因为你的中心原本是为上帝而塑造的，正如人们常说，你里面有一个“上帝形状的空洞”——你放进去的任何东西，你当作最终底线的任何东西，你用来赋予人生意义的任何东西，你认为非有不可、必须拥有的任何东西——不管是什么——因为你把它放在上帝的位置上，它就会变成一个神。你不可能只是“喜欢”你的底线；你不可能只是“喜欢”你生命的核心价值。

你会被它致命地吸引。为了得到它，你什么都愿意做，什么都肯做。你看，“情人之神”——那些我必须追逐的“外邦之神”。这是一个非常非常深刻的分析。

我希望你在各个层面都能看见这一点。现在，有人说：“等一下，你在说什么？你是说人活着总要靠点什么——权力、认可、控制、被需要的需要、独立、成就、工作、浪漫爱情、一段私人关系、各种关系、某一段特定关系、或者自己的外貌。”但是每个人都有某样东西会说：“这就是我把自己投进其怀里的那一位。

这就是我安歇其上的那一位。这就是我所说的：只要我有你，我就会幸福。但我必须有你。”这就是我们在谈的。现在，有人说：“好吧，我大概能理解这对某些人是真的。

我知道有些人会着迷到失控。我也听说过所谓的致命吸引。我也认识一些宗教人士——但不是我。我是怀疑论者。我完全怀疑。

我不相信任何形式的绝对价值。我是彻底的相对主义者。我完全独立。我相信我必须创造自己的现实。你看，所以我不侍奉任何东西。”

但这不是真的。看看你的怀疑。你的怀疑本身，就是你唯一不会去怀疑的东西。我可以证明给你看：如果你真的也怀疑你的怀疑，你就不会那么怀疑了。

我可以证明给你看。再仔细一点，再仔细一点。那正是你所倚靠的东西，是你面对人生的方式。

它就是你用来评判一切其他事物的东西；它就是你面对人生时所倚靠的东西；它就是让你对自己感觉良好的东西。仔细看：你已经把自己永恒的归宿押在它上面。你无法证明没有上帝。

然而你却把你整个的命运都押上了。哦，我的朋友们，我们人人都有“情人神”。我们都有不可触碰的底线。我们都有终极关切。我们都有那些让我们说：“没用的。”

“我非得拥有这个不可。”你就是这样看出它们是什么的。我得往下讲，因为你看，第一点是：你被奴役了。我们被奴役——你知道，那股力量就是罪。但为什么、为什么我们会被奴役呢？

因为任何你放在上帝本该在的位置上的东西，都会变成一个神。任何不是独一真神的东西，只要你对它说：“我必须要它”，它就成了致命的诱惑。乔治·麦克唐纳（George MacDonald）这位古老的苏格兰作家是这样说的：任何你不能与之分离的需要，就是你的统治者。想想这句话。

无论往哪里看，我们都看见破碎：战争、残酷、心碎。

我们在周遭的世界里、也在自己的生命里感受到它。事情怎么会变成这样？又能做些什么呢？在他这个月即将出版的全新著作《这世界怎么了？》中，提摩太·凯勒给出了一个清晰而充满怜悯的答案。

凯勒博士取材于他在 Redeemer（救赎主教会）的一系列讲道，指出：罪的现实解释了我们四周所见的痛苦，而唯有福音才能带来持久的自由与医治。无论你因世界的现状而不堪重负，正在与自己的过失或选择挣扎，还是在寻找盼望与喜乐，《这世界怎么了？》都会帮助你看见：福音如何回应这世界的心碎，也回应我们内心的痛。

这本新出版的《这世界怎么了？》，是我们对你本月奉献的感谢；你的奉献将帮助 Gospel in Life 与更多人分享耶稣的好消息。今天就到 gospelandlife.com/give 申请你的赠书。

那是 gospelandlife.com/give。你先花一分钟自我测试一下。比如：有没有一样东西——如果失去它——你会说：“我其实两周前在另一个地方跟大家讲过这个，我们知道吗？”有没有什么是你一想到就觉得：“如果我没有这个，或者我失去这个，或者我得不到这个、达不到这个，我就完了；我就没法活了；我没有任何可活的理由。我必须要有它。”

凡是你对其说出这种话、却不是真神的，都会比神更重要。任何东西——你会为了什么而把神丢在一边？你们中有些人在过去的那段时间里不就这样做过吗？你会怎么说：“如果神这样对我，如果神允许这事发生，那我就再也不想跟神有任何关系。”不管那“什么”是什么，它就比神更重要，它就成了你的神，对吧？是什么在驱动你？

到底是什么，让你说：“如果我没有这个，我就无法喜乐地领受生命？”关键在那个词：必须。你若把“必须”用在神以外的任何事上，你就落在那东西的权势之下。对吧？看看最底层：看看你的沮丧，看看你的失望，看看你的愤怒，看看你的忧虑。你不要只说：“我怎样才能改变处境？”你必须说：“看，我之所以这么担心、之所以害怕得要命、之所以这么灰心，是因为我对某样东西在说：‘我必须要有它。’”

所以你才会有这些情绪。这在一切事情的底层。罪的捆绑——你的偶像之神、你心里所爱的那些“情人之神”——总会离弃你并且杀害你；但第二，它们也总会让你空虚。看这段经文。第二，它们总会让你空虚。

往下看第27节：他们对木头说：“你是我的父。”对石头说：“你生了我。”他们转背向我，不转脸向我；然而他们遭遇患难的时候却说：“起来拯救我们！”那么，你们为自己造的神在哪里呢？你们遭遇患难的时候，让它们来吧——若能的话——让它们来拯救你们。

“犹大啊，你有多少城镇，就有多少神。”好，犹大。我们从这里学到什么？你所爱的那些神总会使你空虚。你遭遇患难的时候，那些神在哪里？让我其实——如果你愿意，不用看，只要听我读这一段。

仅仅隔了几章，耶利米在第4章30节又一次宣讲。他讲的是同一件事，但说得更尖锐。他对百姓说：你这被毁坏的，做什么呢？你为何穿朱红的衣服，佩戴金饰？你为何用颜料描画眼睛？

你这样装饰自己都是徒然。你的情人藐视你，他们寻索你的性命。这里的教训是什么？教训就是：如果你生命里有任何东西——除了上帝以外——你对它说：“我必须拥有这个，才能喜乐地活。”

它就会控制你。这是第一点；第二点是：你永远也无法满足那个情人——永远。上帝在说：“唉，你这被毁坏的，

你为何用颜料描画眼睛？你为何用珠宝装点自己？你的情人永远不会满足。他们藐视你的生命，他们藐视你，并且寻索你的性命。

你永远也满足不了他们。”我看过一篇书评，评的是欧文·柏林（Irving Berlin）的一生。欧文·柏林——写了很多很棒的歌。他的女儿说，问题在于：不管他成就了多少，一旦达成了什么，他立刻就会陷入一种沮丧。

他会说：“我再也做不出那样的东西了。我再也写不出像那首歌那样的作品了。”成就之神永远不会被满足。无论如何都不会。你说：“只要我达到这个成就层级，那么我所爱的那位神就会对我说：你可以被接纳。

你成功了。”它永远不会这么说——永远不会。它藐视你。

那“苗条之神”呢？

你知道，有些人把它表现得很极端，这就叫饮食失调。但你知道吗？你永远、永远、永远也无法满足“苗条之神”。你读过对超模的采访吗？

她们如何厌恶自己——你知道——肩胛骨后面有那么半英寸的小凸起。她们就说：“我一定哪里不对劲。”你永远无法满足这些东西中的任何一个。还有“工作之神”。当你抱起一个孩子，一个新生儿，而你是他的父母，你可千万别看着它的眼睛说：“我就为这个而活。现在这就是全部了。”

我在生命里有意义。关于那些“孩子生孩子”的故事，最可怕的一点就是，你知道，那些小女孩说：我想要把这个孩子生下来。为什么？这样我就有一个可以去爱的人。这样我就有一样东西值得我活下去。

我生命里什么都没有。亲爱的朋友们，你的孩子在某个时候——哪怕孩子总体上都挺顺利——总有一天，你的孩子会轻看你、甚至厌弃你。你不能为这个而活。现在，这就是偶像的力量。

他们对木头说话，他们对石头说话。偶像的制造者并不是创造木头和石头；他们拿木头和石头，把它做成一个偶像。你看，这里有个微妙之处。

这就是偶像的力量：它们本来是好东西。木头没有错，石头也没有错，关键在于你拿它们做了什么。

孩子没有错；想把自己的外表打理好也没有错；工作没有错；成就没有错。你看，这些都是好东西。

所以它们才那么有力。神把它们造成本是好的；它们本身就是好的，里面带着一种“良善的力量”。很多时候，它们的吸引力正是从这里来的。

可是，当你把它们放在只有神才该在的位置上，当你把它们立在只有神才该坐的宝座上，你把它们“做成”的那个东西就开始对你施加巨大的权势。但它们永远不会满足，永远不会。你到底想从这些东西得到什么？你为它们把自己装点起来。

你说：要是……就好了。我的意思是，你为什么那么拼命？为什么你们当中有些人在那么多方面都被驱使、被推动？你想让这些偶像“神明”对你说一句它们永远不会说的话。你想让它们说：“好，你这又良善又忠心的仆人……可以进来享受你主人的快乐。看，我张开双臂欢迎你。来吧，你在我面前完全蒙悦纳。”永远不会，永远不会。

它们只会说：“你本来可以做得更好。”它们总是这样。而且听着，如果你真想看清楚——耶利米说，神说——如果你真想看清楚，你的诸神会把你留在何等彻底的破产、何等彻底的空虚里，不要在阳光灿烂的时候去测试你的宗教；当你陷入困境时，去呼求你的诸神。

那他们到时怎么帮得了你呢？你看，你们中还有相当多人仍然在外面说：你知道，我不知道你在讲什么。我没有这种问题。我在自己生命里感受不到、也看不见什么致命的吸引力。你看，等麻烦来了再说。

到那时去求告你们的神吧。我给你们举三个例子。假神永远帮不了你。这些“情人神”在三种情形下永远帮不了你。三种，明白吗？

重病、丧亲与死亡、以及失败——它们永远做不到。你看，比如说，如果你真的病得很重呢？如果你长期生重病，甚至永久卧病在床呢？你就只能躺着。

除了真神以外，没有任何神能在那时帮助你。你是为物质财产而活吗？你是为成就而活吗？你是为外貌而活吗？你是为关系而活吗？

那么你到底是为谁而活？如果你永久卧床，上述每一个神都不得不离弃你。它们在那种事上帮不了你。只有真实的上帝能。你会说：那也许不会发生在我身上。

你会变老的。到那时去求告你们的神吧。除了真神，没有一个会兑现承诺；没有一个能带你走过来。我们再来看看死亡。

你说的死亡是什么意思？你会说：嗯，我是这个意思。如果你有一段很好的婚姻呢？如果你的配偶是你生命的意义呢？如果你的配偶是给你喜乐的那一位呢？

总得有人先死。这是我和Kathy时不时会去看的事。我们会说：你知道吗？除非发生某种非常非常非常离奇、不可思议的巧合，否则我们两个人中总有一个会被留下。而如果我们把对方当作我们的神——如果我们其中任何一个把另一个当作自己的神——当我们的神躺在棺材里时，祂怎么帮助我们呢？

到那时去求告你们的神吧。你们为自己造出来的神——那些你们把美好的事物变成的神——到那时它们永远帮不了你。那时你就会明白。

那时你就会明白。也许你直到疾病临到，才知道这些就是你的“情人神”。直到死亡临到——我再给你一个：失败，失败。亲爱的朋友们，人们不断对我说：你知道，我想我知道上帝赦免我，可是我在这里失败了。

作为父母，我失败了。作为配偶，我失败了。作为雇员，我失败了。我没有达标。我做错了事。

我无法原谅自己。这听起来很谦卑，但你知道你的意思是什么吗？你其实是在说：我有一个神。一个比神还高的神。因为圣经说神饶恕我，这个事实在你看来并不能真正成立。

我把某样东西放在神之上，而现在那样东西不肯饶恕我。你知道为什么偶像从不饶恕吗？从不。如果你活着是为了你的工作；如果你活着是为了金钱；如果你活着是为了关系。

如果你活着是为了道德。我遇到一些人来说：我很虔诚，但我搞砸了。现在我无法原谅自己。我到耶稣那里去，我知道他饶恕我，但我无法原谅自己。那么，道德就是你的偶像，你的神。

你把基督教当作你的神，而不是基督。宗教永远不会饶恕你。任何神都不会饶恕你。除了真神。它们不会。

它们鄙视你。它们要你的命。在患难的时候呼求你的诸神——你为自己造的那些神——你就会明白你为何不能原谅自己。

因为你有一个比神还高的神。除了神以外，没有任何神会饶恕你。你还看不出来这些东西不能帮助你吗？我是说，如果你活着是为了道德成就，当它失去的时候，它怎么能帮助你呢？如果你活着是为了关系，当它们消失的时候，它们怎么能帮助你呢？

你还看不出来吗？它们在死亡面前永远帮不了你。它们在失败中永远帮不了你。它们在疾病、痛苦和受难中永远帮不了你。你知道为什么吗？

因为它们根本不存在。它们只是你自己的延伸，是你意志与权力的延伸。你看，它们里面没有生命。它们只是僵在那里。

它们不过是石头。当你的心碎了，它们永远不会帮助你。而如果你在心碎时找不到任何安慰，那是因为在你生命中有一样东西比神更像神。现在最后，好吧。这些东西使你被奴役，也使你空虚。

那么我们怎么才能得医治呢？太好了。看看最后。第31节：“你们当听耶和华的话。我岂向以色列作旷野吗？”

哦，你看这个。你看这个。“我岂向以色列作了旷野，或作了幽暗之地么？为什么我的百姓说：我们脱离约束，可以任意而行；我们不再来亲近你？”

“处女岂能忘记她的妆饰呢？新妇岂能忘记她的装饰呢？然而我的百姓忘记了我，日子无数。”现在看这里。

看。神在说什么？他说，听着。你见过一个新娘走上红毯的时候说：“天哪，我忘了化妆！”吗？你见过一个新娘走上红毯的时候说：“天哪，你知道吗，我忘了戴耳环！”吗？

她们不会那样做。嗯，也许，也许有那么一个。但你知道，她们不会忘记这种事。她们不会忘记这些。为什么？因为新娘会做大量的准备工作，好让自己尽可能地、美得无可挑剔。

顺便说一句，这一切——我的意思是——我从没见过一个新娘失败的。一次也没有。没有。你有各种办法把自己不太好看的地方遮起来；各种办法把好看的地方凸显出来；你走出来就像个幻梦一样，整个礼堂里每个人都想娶你。

你为什么要这么努力让这件事发生？因为你想要的——你也许在想着他们——但基本上你是在想着他；你是走向你的爱人，你希望他对你说：“我向你敞开。你真美。我完全接纳你。所有的隔阂都放下了。

你可以完全进入。做得好。可以进来享受我的快乐。”神说：你知道怎样在身体上让自己变得可被接纳，却不明白怎样在属灵上做到。你知道你为什么这么拼命吗？

你知道你为什么追逐这些吗？你知道你为什么这么努力想变得漂亮吗？你知道你为什么这么努力想成功吗？你知道你为什么这么努力追求这些东西——权力、认可——你是在试着遮盖你的赤身。你是在试着遮住我们每个人都有的那种不够好的感觉，对吧？

你非常努力地想让某个人对你说：“我接纳你。”你难道不明白吗？我可以成为你的妆饰。我可以成为你的义。我可以成为你被接纳的根基。

我可以做到。现在我不知道耶利米当时怎么想，也不知道神在讲什么。他对这事有一个大致的理解，但我们有一个具体的理解。在《以弗所书》第五章我们读到：“你们作丈夫的，要爱你们的妻子，正如基督爱教会，为教会舍己，为要使教会成为圣洁，用水借着道把教会洗净，叫他可以献给自己，作个荣耀的教会，毫无玷污、皱纹等类的病，乃是圣洁没有瑕疵的。”

耶稣基督怎样把你变成你一生都在努力想把自己变成的那个人——你一直追逐这些“情人之神”的时候想要成为的那个人？他怎么做的？你知道他怎么做的吗？他把自己交出来了，交给每一个藐视你、想要夺你性命的神。但这位神给出了自己；他不是要你的命，他把自己的命给了。

这是一位神，在十字架上被剥去衣服，好叫你可以被遮盖。他在黑暗中赤身露体，好叫你可以在光明中被遮盖。你看见了吗？他被毁容，好叫你可以美丽。他被弃绝，好叫你可以被接纳，父可以对你说：“做得好，良善又忠心的仆人。”

当我们信靠他时，他在十字架上一切伟大的工作就成了我们的。他的义成了我们的——圣经就是这么说的。这就是为什么神在这里可以说：我不知道他们当时怎样理解，但我们现在明白了。

新妇岂能忘记她的妆饰吗？新妇岂能忘记她的美丽吗？你却忘记了我。我可以成为你的美。你看，你到处奔跑，绝望地想让自己看起来很棒，去追你的“情人之神”，让周围的人对你说：“做得好，良善又忠心的仆人。”你在试图用义给自己穿上衣服，但你永远做不到。

只有我——唯有我——能做到。你看见发生了什么吗？你看见他在说什么吗？新妇会忘记吗？新妇会忘记她的婚纱吗？但你却忘记了我。这是最令人震惊的事。

每当你看着任何东西并说：“我一定要拥有你；如果没有你，我就会死。”你们当中有些人现在就在这么做。这就是你如此灰心的原因。当你这么说时，你就完全忘记了——或者你从未听过——耶稣在十字架上为你所做的事：他被剥得赤身露体，好叫你可以被遮盖。

他是你的珠宝。他是使你美丽的那一位。是的，所以神说：我对你而言是旷野吗？你没有看见我为你做了什么。你没有看见我能成为你的什么。

所以我想说的是：你必须做的是什么。听着，我不是在听你说。我也不是想证明基督教是真的。我只是想让你看见：甚至没有任何别的宗教宣称它的神是这样的。

在每一个其他宗教里、每一种其他哲学里，所有其他的神都说：你这样做，你就能活；失败了，你就得死。唯独我们这位神说：你失败了，我却要为你死。没有别的宗教。其他宗教说：我们的神太伟大了，不可能死。

我们的信仰说：我们的神大到一个地步，他竟然死了。每一个别的神都要你的命；这位神把自己的命给了你。我不是在证明基督教是真的；当然有许多方法可以给出证据。

我只是要说：这是唯一一个甚至宣称有这样的神的宗教。正如那首伟大的诗所说：别的神都强壮，唯独你却软弱；他们乘骑，你却踉跄登上宝座。并且唯有神的伤口才能述说；但除了你以外，没有任何神有伤口。

唯一一位甚至宣称自己有伤口的神。唯一一位甚至宣称把自己献给你的神。当你痛苦、焦躁的时候，你需要做的就是：不要只说，为什么我这么痛苦？为什么神让这事发生在我身上？

要明白：你之所以如此痛苦，是因为你心里在说一些话——我必须得到它们。然后转过来对自己说：等一下，我不一定非得得到它们。我唯一必须拥有的，是耶稣基督；他是我的妆饰。

我不必用这些东西来遮盖我内心的不足感。他是我的美，他是我的义。换句话说，对他说那最后一节——你知道那一节。哦，你记得那首赞美诗的副歌吗？换句话说，要对他说：我要起来，往耶稣那里去。

他要把我拥在怀里。在我亲爱的救主怀抱中，有一万种令人倾心的魅力。不要忘记他。让我们祷告。父啊，当我们现在把自己献给你时，我们开始看见，我们生命中那些曾被我们视为无法解释的疼痛、艰难的苦楚、说不清的忧伤。

我们开始看见这一切如何彼此契合。因为我们追逐的、在你以外的那些事物——我们把生命的中心放在其上的那些事物，而不是放在你身上——它们都藐视我们。它们要夺取我们的生命。我们想让它们对我们说：“做得好。”它们永远不会满足。

我们要起来。我们要到耶稣那里去。他要拥抱我们。在那里，我们将找到真正的安息。我们感谢你：在他里面，我们光彩照人、毫无瑕疵、无玷无皱纹。

父啊，我们当中那些知道这些却没有活在其中的人，我们祈求你赐给我们能力去活出来，并用它来面对我们的软弱。我们当中那些还不明白的人，我祈求你追寻他们，使他们在明白之前绝不放弃，并以此为他们生命的中心事实而欢喜快乐。我们奉耶稣的名祈求。
