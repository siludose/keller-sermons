### Introduction: The Problem of Sin

Some people say the fundamental problem of the world is poverty. Others say it's bad systems, poor education or biology, but what if none of these can fully explain the brokenness we see, both in the headlines and in our own hearts? In today's teaching, Tim Keller looks at how the Bible's teaching on sin gives us a deeply honest and yet incredibly hopeful view of the world.

I'd like to read to you our text on which the teaching is based this morning. It's Jeremiah chapter 2. We began looking at this chapter last week. This is the first of Jeremiah's sermons to the people of Judah. It's on the subject of sin, and we looked at the first part of the chapter and the sermon last week, and we look at the rest this week. Jeremiah 2 verses 19 to 32.

> "Your wickedness will punish you. Your backsliding will rebuke you. Consider then and realize how evil and bitter it is for you when you forsake the Lord your God and have no awe of me declares the Lord, the Lord Almighty."

**Long ago you broke off your yoke and tore off your bonds. You said, I will not serve you. Indeed, on every high hill and under every spreading tree you lay down as a prostitute.**

### The Character of Sin

Now we started looking at this last week. This is a very modern situation into which Jeremiah is speaking because his country, his society was literally falling apart. It was falling apart politically and it was falling apart psychologically and socially and culturally. Everybody was asking what's wrong and the answer of the sermon, the answer of God through Jeremiah was, it's not the economy stupid, it's sin.

He began, we looked at this last week, first talking about the character of sin. The character of sin that we saw last week is beautifully summed up in a little statement by Dorothy Sayers in which she defined sin as a deep interior dislocation of the soul.

> "A deep interior dislocation of the soul, it's a wonderful little phrase."

**When a hip or a bone of any sort is dislocated, what is that? What's the problem? It's off center. It's not centered at the spot it should be. And as a result, there's tremendous, tremendous havoc, the muscles, the tissue, there's all this cutting and grinding you see and there's tremendous damage being done and it's in pain. Your hip doesn't work, you can't walk, you can't move, you can't move your arm. Sin is a dislocation of the soul.**

### The Consequences of Sin

Today we're going to look at the consequences. What actually happens? What are the effects? What are the things that actually happen when we do that? And the effects, of course, are terribly drastic. You see, right here in the beginning of this marvelous passage, it says, God says, your wickedness will punish you. Your backsliding will rebuke you.

> "Your wickedness will punish you. Your backsliding will rebuke you."

**When you tell a child, don't play with the toy that way or it'll break. You know, the child loves the toy. Dear, don't do that. You're breaking the rules and you'll break the toy. What if the child continues to sin against what you said? The child continues to do differently than what he was told and the toy breaks. And he's in tears. What does the parent do? You don't have anything else you have to do. He brought the punishment. His wickedness punished him. His backsliding rebuked him, you see. It already happened. There's not much else you have to do because you see, he is saying in verse 19, sin brings its own consequences. If you disobey the word of God, the Bible says, that will be enough. You'll break your heart. You'll break your life. You'll break your relationships. You'll break your soul. Terrible consequences.**

### The Enslavement by Lover Gods

Now, what are those consequences? How do we break things? How does everything fall apart? Things fall apart. Says the novel. That's right. Because it's sin. Now, what are the consequences? There are actually two in this particular passage. There's two that are mentioned. And they're mentioned under a wonderful image, a wonderful new metaphor. And that metaphor is this. God in a penetrating way says that sin leads us to fall in love with other gods. In other words, we have lover gods. We have gods. We have idols with whom we fall in love with. We have lover gods. And those lover gods will always do two things. They'll always have two effects on us. They will enslave us and they will leave us empty. They will enslave us and they will leave us empty.

**Your lover gods, on the one hand, they bring about a bondage. And on the other hand, they bring about radical disappointment, complete emptiness.**

### The Emptiness Left by Lover Gods

Look at this passage. Secondly, they will always leave you empty. Down here verse 27, they say to wood, you are my father, and to stone you gave me birth. They have turned their backs to me and not their faces. Yet when they are in trouble, they say, come and save us. Where then are the gods you have made for yourselves? Let them come if they can and save you when you're in trouble. For you have as many gods as you have towns. Oh, Judah, now what do we learn here? Your lover gods will always leave you empty. Where are the gods when you're in trouble?

> "Where then are the gods you have made for yourselves? Let them come if they can and save you when you're in trouble."

**Your lover gods will always leave you empty.**

### The Healing from God

Lastly, all right. These things leave you enslaved and they leave you empty. Well how can we be healed? Wonderful. Look at the very end. Verse 31, hear the word of the Lord. Have I been a desert to Israel? Oh look at this. Look at this. Have I been a desert to Israel or a land of great darkness? Why do my people say we are free to roam? We will come to you no more. Does a maiden forget her jewelry? Does a bride forget her wedding ornaments? Yet my people have forgotten me. Days without number.

> "Have I been a desert to Israel or a land of great darkness? Why do my people say we are free to roam? We will come to you no more."

**God says, you know how to make yourself acceptable physically but you don't understand how to do it spiritually. You know why you're working so hard? You know why you're going after these. You know why you're trying so hard to be pretty. You know why you're trying so hard to be successful. You know why you're trying so hard for these things for power and for approval and for you're trying to cover your nakedness. You're trying to cover over the sense of inadequacy we all have, right? You're trying very hard to get someone to say I accept you. Don't you understand? I can be your ornament. I can be your righteousness. I can be your acceptability. I can do it.**

In chapter five of Ephesians we read, husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her wholly cleansing her so as to present her to himself radiant without stain or wrinkle or any blemish wholly and blameless. How does Jesus Christ make you what you've been trying to make yourself all of your life by going after these lover gods? How does he do it? You know how he does it? He gave herself every other God that despises you and seeks your life. But this God gave, he doesn't seek your life, he gave his life. This is a God who on the cross was stripped so you could be clothed. He was naked in the dark so that you could be clothed in the light. You see? He was disfigured so you could be beautiful. He was cast out so someone to the Father could say, well done. Good and faithful servant. When we believe in him, all of his great work on the cross becomes ours. His righteousness becomes ours. That's what the Bible says. That's how God can say here, I don't know how they understood it but we understand it now. Does a bride forget her ornaments? Does a bride forget her beauty? You have forgotten me. I can be your beauty. Here you are out running around desperately trying to look great, to get your lover gods, to get others around you to say, well done, good and faithful servant, to you're trying to clothe yourself with righteousness so you can never do it. I and I alone can do it.

> "Does a bride forget her ornaments? Does a bride forget her beauty? You have forgotten me. I can be your beauty."

**A bride forgets, would a bride forget her wedding dress, but you've forgotten me. The most astonishing thing. When you ever look at anything and say, I must have you. If I don't have that, I die and some of you are doing that right now. That's the reason why you're so discouraged. When you say that, you have completely forgotten or you've never heard of what Jesus did on the cross for you. He was stripped naked so that you could be clothed. He's your jewelry. He's that which makes you beautiful. Yes, why God says, am I a desert to you? You don't see what I've done for you. You don't see what I can be to you.**

Let's pray. Father, as we offer ourselves to you now, we're beginning to see that things that we looked at in our lives as inexplicable pain and difficult misery and unexplainable distress. We're starting to see how it all fits together. It's because the other things that we've gone after besides you, the things that we've centered our life on, instead of you, they despise us. They seek our life. We're trying to get them to say, well done. They never will be satisfied. We will arise. We will go to Jesus. He will embrace us. And there we'll find true rest. We thank you that in him we are radiant, spotless, without stain or wrinkle. Father, those of us who are here who know this but we're not living it, we pray that you give us the power to live it and face the week with it. Those of us here who don't understand this yet, I pray that you would get after them and they would never give up until they understand it and rejoice in it as the central fact of their life. And we ask this in Jesus' name.

### 引言：罪的问题

有些人说，世界的根本问题是贫穷。还有人说是糟糕的制度、教育不足或生物学问题，但如果这些都不能完全解释我们在头条新闻和自己内心中看到的破碎呢？在今天的教导中，Tim Keller 看圣经对罪的教导，给我们一个深刻诚实但又令人难以置信的希望的世界观。

我想读给你们我们今天早上的教导所基于的经文。是耶利米书第二章。我们上周开始看这章。这是耶利米对犹大人民的第一篇讲道。主题是罪，我们上周看了这章和讲道的第一部分，这周我们看剩下的部分。耶利米书 2 章 19 到 32 节。

> “你的罪孽必惩罚你，你的背道必责备你。你当知道并看明，离弃耶和华你的神，不存敬畏我的心，是何等的恶事、苦事。这是主万军之耶和华说的。”

**很久以前你就打破了你的轭，撕裂了你的绳索。你说，我不服侍你。的确，在每一个高冈上和每一棵茂盛的树下，你都像妓女一样躺下。**

### 罪的特性

我们上周开始看这个。这是一个非常现代的情境，耶利米在其中说话，因为他的国家，他的社会实际上正在分崩离析。它在政治上崩溃，在心理上、社会上和文化上崩溃。每个人都在问出了什么问题，而讲道的答案，神通过耶利米的答案是，不是经济问题，而是罪。

他开始，我们上周看了，首先谈到罪的特性。我们上周看到的罪的特性在多萝西·塞耶斯的一句简短陈述中得到了美丽的总结，她将罪定义为灵魂的深层内在错位。

> “灵魂的深层内在错位，这是一个美妙的短语。”

**当髋关节或任何种类的骨头错位时，那是什么？问题是什么？它偏离了中心。它没有在它应该在的位置居中。因此，造成了巨大的混乱，肌肉、组织，你看到有所有这些切割和磨损，并且造成了巨大的损害和疼痛。你的髋关节不起作用，你不能走路，你不能移动，你不能移动你的手臂。罪是灵魂的错位。**

### 罪的后果

今天我们要看后果。实际发生了什么？有什么影响？当我们这样做时，实际发生了什么？当然，这些影响是非常严重的。你看，在这段精彩的经文的开头，它说，神说，你的罪孽必惩罚你。你的背道必责备你。

> “你的罪孽必惩罚你。你的背道必责备你。”

**当你告诉一个孩子，不要那样玩玩具，否则它会坏掉。你知道，孩子喜欢玩具。亲爱的，不要那样做。你在违反规则，你会弄坏玩具。如果孩子继续违背你所说的，继续做与他被告知不同的事情，玩具坏了。他在哭泣。父母该怎么做？你没有其他事情要做。他带来了惩罚。他的罪孽惩罚了他。他的背道责备了他，你看。它已经发生了。你没有太多其他事情要做，因为你看，他在第 19 节中说，罪带来了自己的后果。如果你不服从神的话，圣经说，那就够了。你会伤心。你会破坏你的生活。你会破坏你的关系。你会破坏你的灵魂。可怕的后果。**

### 被情人神奴役

那么，这些后果是什么？我们如何破坏事物？一切如何崩溃？事物崩溃。小说说。没错。因为是罪。那么，后果是什么？在这段特定的经文中实际上有两个。提到了两个。它们是在一个美妙的形象下提到的，一个美妙的新隐喻。这个隐喻是这样的。神以一种深刻的方式说，罪使我们爱上其他神。换句话说，我们有情人神。我们有神。我们有偶像，我们爱上了它们。我们有情人神。这些情人神总是会对我们产生两种影响。它们会奴役我们，它们会让我们空虚。它们会奴役我们，它们会让我们空虚。

**你的情人神，一方面，它们带来了束缚。另一方面，它们带来了极大的失望，完全的空虚。**

### 情人神留下的空虚

看看这段经文。其次，它们总是让你空虚。下面第 27 节，他们对木头说，你是我的父亲，对石头说，你生了我。他们背向我，不是面向我。然而，当他们遇到麻烦时，他们说，来拯救我们。你们为自己造的神在哪里呢？让他们来，如果他们能在你遇到麻烦时拯救你。因为你有多少城镇，就有多少神。哦，犹大，现在我们在这里学到了什么？你的情人神总是让你空虚。当你遇到麻烦时，神在哪里呢？

> “你们为自己造的神在哪里呢？让他们来，如果他们能在你遇到麻烦时拯救你。”

**你的情人神总是让你空虚。**

### 从神而来的医治

最后，好吧。这些东西让你被奴役，它们让你空虚。那么我们如何得到医治？太好了。看看最后一节。第 31 节，听耶和华的话。我曾是以色列的旷野吗？哦，看看这个。看看这个。我曾是以色列的旷野吗，或是大黑暗之地吗？为什么我的百姓说我们自由漫游？我们不再归向你。少女会忘记她的珠宝吗？新娘会忘记她的婚饰吗？然而，我的百姓忘记了我，日子无数。

> “我曾是以色列的旷野吗，或是大黑暗之地吗？为什么我的百姓说我们自由漫游？我们不再归向你。”

**神说，你知道如何让自己在外表上被接受，但你不明白如何在灵性上做到这一点。你知道为什么你努力工作吗？你知道为什么你追求这些吗？你知道为什么你努力变得漂亮吗？你知道为什么你努力成功吗？你知道为什么你努力争取这些东西，为了权力和认可，因为你在努力掩盖我们都有的那种不充分感，对吗？你非常努力地让某人说我接受你。你不明白吗？我可以成为你的装饰。我可以成为你的义。我可以成为你的可接受性。我可以做到。**

在以弗所书第五章中我们读到，丈夫要爱妻子，正如基督爱教会，为她舍己，使她成为圣洁，洗净她，以便将她呈现给自己，光辉灿烂，没有污点或皱纹或任何瑕疵，圣洁无瑕。耶稣基督如何使你成为你一生中试图通过追求这些情人神来成为的样子？他是如何做到的？你知道他是如何做到的吗？他舍己，其他所有神都鄙视你并寻求你的生命。但这位神给予，他不寻求你的生命，他给予他的生命。这是一位在十字架上被剥夺的神，以便你可以被穿上。他在黑暗中赤身裸体，以便你可以在光明中被穿上。你看到了吗？他被毁容，以便你可以美丽。他被抛弃，以便有人对父亲说，做得好。忠心的仆人。当我们相信他时，他在十字架上的伟大工作就成为我们的。他的义成为我们的。这就是圣经所说的。这就是神在这里可以说的，我不知道他们是如何理解的，但我们现在理解了。新娘会忘记她的装饰吗？新娘会忘记她的美丽吗？你忘记了我。我可以成为你的美丽。你在外面拼命地试图看起来很棒，试图让你的情人神，让你周围的人说，做得好，忠心的仆人，你在试图用义来装扮自己，所以你永远做不到。我和我一个人可以做到。

> “新娘会忘记她的装饰吗？新娘会忘记她的美丽吗？你忘记了我。我可以成为你的美丽。”

**新娘会忘记她的婚纱，但你忘记了我。最令人惊讶的事情。当你看着任何东西说，我必须拥有你。如果我没有那个，我就死了，你们中的一些人现在正在这样做。这就是为什么你如此沮丧的原因。当你这样说时，你完全忘记了或你从未听说过耶稣在十字架上为你所做的。他被剥光衣服，以便你可以被穿上。他是你的珠宝。他是让你美丽的东西。是的，为什么神说，我对你来说是沙漠吗？你没有看到我为你做了什么。你没有看到我可以成为你的什么。**

让我们祷告。父啊，当我们现在将自己献给你时，我们开始看到我们在生活中看作无法解释的痛苦和困难的痛苦和无法解释的困扰。我们开始看到这一切如何结合在一起。这是因为我们除了你之外追求的其他事物，我们将生活的中心放在这些事物上，而不是你，它们鄙视我们。它们寻求我们的生命。我们试图让它们说，做得好。它们永远不会满足。我们将起来。我们将去耶稣那里。他将拥抱我们。在那里我们会找到真正的安息。我们感谢你，因为在他里面我们是光辉灿烂的，没有污点或皱纹。父啊，那些在这里知道这一点但我们没有活出这一点的人，我们祈求你给我们力量去活出这一点并面对这一周。那些在这里还不明白这一点的人，我祈求你去追求他们，直到他们理解并以此为生活的中心事实而喜悦。我们奉耶稣的名祈求。
