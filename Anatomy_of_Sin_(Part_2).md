## English Transcript / 英文原文

today's teaching, Tim Keller looks at how the Bible's teaching on sin gives us a deeply  honest and yet incredibly hopeful view of the world. I'd like to read to you our text on which the teaching is based this morning. It's Jeremiah chapter 2. We began looking at this chapter last week. This is the first of Jeremiah's sermons to the people of Judah.

It's on the subject of sin, and we looked at the first part of the chapter and the sermon  last week, and we look at the rest this week. Jeremiah 2 verses 19 to 32. Your wickedness will punish you. Your backsliding will rebuke you. Consider then and realize how evil and bitter it is for you when you forsake the Lord your  God and have no all of me declares the Lord, the Lord Almighty.

Long ago you broke off your yoke and tore off your bonds. You said, I will not serve you. Indeed, on every high hill and under every spreading tree you lay down as a prostitute. I had planted you like a choice of wine of sound and reliable stock. How then did you turn against me into a corrupt wild vine?

Although you wash yourself with soda and use an abundance of soap, the stain of your guilt  is still before me declares the Lord, the sovereign Lord. How can you say, I am not the Filed, I have not run after the Bales. See how you behaved in the valley, consider what you have done. You are a swift she camel running here and there, a wild donkey accustomed to the desert, sniffing  the wind in her craving, in her heat who can restrain her, and emails that pursue her  need not tire themselves at mating time they will find her. Do not run until your feet are bare and your throat is dry, but you said, it's no use,  I love foreign gods, and I must go after them.

As a thief is disgraced when he is caught, so the house of Israel is disgraced. They, their kings and their officials, their priests and their prophets, they say to wood,  you are my father, and to stone, you gave me birth. They have turned their backs to me and not their faces yet, when they are in trouble they  say, come and save us. Where then are the gods you made for yourselves? Let them come if they can save you when you are in trouble.

For you have as many gods as you have towns, O Judah. Why do you bring charges against me? You have all rebelled against me to clear the Lord. In vain I punished your people, they did not respond to correction. Your sword is devoured your prophets like a ravening lion.

You of this generation consider the word of the Lord. Have I been a desert to Israel or a land of great darkness? Why do my people say we are free to roam? We will come to you no more. Does a maiden forget her jewelry, a bride, her wedding ornaments?

Yet my people have forgotten me, days without number. This is God's word. Now we started looking at this last week. This is a very modern situation into which Jeremiah is speaking because his country, his society  was literally falling apart. It was falling apart politically and it was falling apart psychologically and socially and  culturally.

Everybody was asking what's wrong and the answer of the sermon, the answer of God through  Jeremiah was, it's not the economy stupid, it's sin. He began, we looked at this last week, first talking about the character of sin. The character of sin that we saw last week is beautifully summed up in a little statement  by Dorothy Sayers in which she defined sin as a deep interior dislocation of the soul. A deep interior dislocation of the soul, it's a wonderful little phrase. When a hip or a bone of any sort is dislocated, what is that?

What's the problem? It's off center. It's not centered at the spot it should be. And as a result, there's tremendous, tremendous havoc, the muscles, the tissue, there's  all this cutting and grinding you see and there's tremendous damage being done and it's in pain. Your hip doesn't work, you can't walk, you can't move, you can't move your arm.

Sin is a dislocation of the soul. The soul should be centered on God. If there is a God, we saw last week, if there is a God, then he'd be the great  creator and everything in our life should revolve around him, should center on him. But we said sin is the demand of the heart that everything, including God, revolve around  me, my happiness, my goals, my agenda, what makes me comfortable. That's sin, a dislocation of the soul and all of our problems come from our unwillingness  to center on him because we do not want to lose control.

Whatever we center on controls us. So we say, we have no awe of him, we don't center on him now. That was last week, the character sin, today we're going to look at the consequences. What actually happens? What are the effects?

What are the things that actually happen when we do that? And the effects, of course, are terribly drastic. You see, right here in the beginning of this marvelous passage, it says, God says, your wickedness  will punish you. Your backsliding will rebuke you. You see that?

Look. He says, I won't have to do it. Your wickedness will punish you. Your backsliding will rebuke you. When you tell a child, don't play with the toy that way or it'll break.

You know, the child loves the toy. Dear, don't do that. You're breaking the rules and you'll break the toy. What if the child continues to sin against what you said? The child continues to do differently than what he was told and the toy breaks.

And he's in tears. What does the parent do? You don't have anything else you have to do. He brought the punishment. His wickedness punished him.

His backsliding rebuked him, you see. It already happened. There's not much else you have to do because you see, he is saying in verse 19, sin brings  its own consequences. If you disobey the word of God, the Bible says, that will be enough. You'll break your heart.

You'll break your life. You'll break your relationships. You'll break your soul. Terrible consequences. Now, what are those consequences?

How do we break things? How does everything fall apart? Things fall apart. Says the novel. That's right.

Because it's sin. Now, what are the consequences? There are actually two in this particular passage. There's two that are mentioned. And they're mentioned under a wonderful image, a wonderful new metaphor.

And that metaphor is this. God in a penetrating way says that sin leads us to fall in love with other gods. In other words, we have lover gods. We have gods. We have idols with whom we fall in love with.

We have lover gods. And those lover gods will always do two things. They'll always have two effects on us. They will enslave us and they will leave us empty. They will enslave us and they will leave us empty.

Now, let's take a look at that. They will enslave us and leave us empty. Your lover gods, on the one hand, they bring about a bondage. And on the other hand, they bring about radical disappointment, complete emptiness. First of all, verse 23, 24 and 25, how can you say, I am not defiled.

I have not run after the bails. See, the bails are idols. See how you behaved in the valley. Consider what you've done. You're a swifty camel running here and there, a wild dunkey accustomed to the desert, sniffing  the wind in her craving in her heat, who can restrain her.

Any males that pursue her need not tire themselves at mating times, they will find her. Do not run until your feet are bare and your throat is dry, but you said, it's no use. I love foreign gods. I must go after them. What do we learn here?

It is an image that God uses to these desert dwellers who understood animals very well. They lived with the animals. Their livelihood depended on their animals. Their lives depended on the animals. And here's one thing they knew, that when an animal got into the mating season, there  was no stopping that animal.

The picture is of an animal in the grip of craving, in the grip of a foundational instinct. No stopping that animal. What are we learning here? The first thing we learn is it's sort of a general thing, under this subject of slavery. First of all, sin has a power to enslave that we hide from ourselves.

You notice? God says, in the beginning, you say, I am not defiled. There's nothing wrong with me, but in the end of that two verses, do you see what he says? It's no use. I must go after them.

And the first thing we're being taught here is that sin brings a slavery. Sin has a power over you. That you will, in the beginning, in the beginning, you'll say, it's not true. I'm not defiled. This isn't a problem.

This isn't a problem. But in the end, you'll say, it's no use. If you deny the power of sin in your life, eventually you'll be brought to despair. See, take a look. It says, how can I say, how can you say, I am not defiled?

There was a time magazine article back in August, I think it was the August 15th edition. And it was on adultery and fidelity. And here was the point of the magazine article. The point of the article was to say, you know what? Marriage doesn't fit us.

We are not built to be faithful to one person all of our lives. It's not natural. Now what's behind that? Behind the scholarship. You know what I hear?

I hear a guy wanting to break a promise to his wife. He made many years ago to be faithful and saying, you know, I'm not defiled. It's just not natural. It's just the way I am. Marriage doesn't fit me.

I am not defiled. I'm not in the power of sin as I'm now breaking my promise. I'm not in the grip of a lust. Oh no, it's just as I'm just being true to who I am. God says, if you deny the power sin early on in your life, rationalizing it, saying,  I am not defiled.

In the end, you'll be brought to despair. Can't you see this? Can't you see the power sin in your life? Listen, you who are married, you should certainly know. You know, before you get married, you're continually told by people about your faults.

You're told that you're picky or you're sensitive or you're obsessive or you're kind  of a coward here or you're anxious or you're kind of selfish or you have a trouble with  your temper or you tend to hold grudges. And over the years, you've seen these things and people have pointed them out to you, but  you've always said, I am not defiled. That's not such a big problem. I could change if I really had to and then you get married. If there's anybody in this room who ought to know about the power of sin, it should be  the people who are married who have been married.

Why don't you know? You should know why. These things create problems for you and you see how strong they are. You say, okay, honey, I'll change and you're right back into it. How many times you don't have to be married to see this?

You make your resolutions. You say, I'll never do that again. And you do it. I won't lose my temper the way I used to. I won't stay in this habit.

I won't give into fears. You sink your sincere. You are sincere and you can't stop. The power of sin in your life, Paul says, the apostle Paul. He says, the good that I would, I do not.

And that which I would not, I do. Are you more compassionate than Paul? Are you more have more integrity than Paul? Are you more of a self-sense, a self-sacrifice than Paul? Are you a better person than Paul?

But he admits it. Can't you see it? If you start out denying it, I'm not defiled, you'll end up saying it's no use. Eventually you'll see that there is a power in you that is beyond you. You can spend a lot of time rationalizing it.

You can take courses in both psychology and sociology to do everything to redefine sin  in such a way that we're able to say we're not defiled, but in the end we'll say it's  no use. But here's what's so interesting about these three verses. It doesn't just tell us that sin is an enslaving power, but it tells us why. And the reason it tells us, this is fascinating. God tells us that the reason that we are under the power of sin is because, listen, sin  is a fatal attraction.

Sin is a fatal attraction. But you say it's no use, I love foreign gods, I must go after them. Now, what is a fatal attraction? You know, the movie, of course, gave us the term, but we've always known about it. A fatal attraction is when a man or woman gets obsessed with someone that you'll do anything.

You'll lie, you'll steal, you'll kill, anything. And we all say, ah, of course, that's obsessive, that there's something wrong there. That person has taken something and made it so important that it's more important than  anything else, any principle, anything, ah, we're not like that. And God says that's not true. God says every human being has a fatal attraction to something.

Every human being has lover gods, every human being has a bottom line. Every human being has something that you live for, that you say, I must have that. And whatever you say, I must have that about. That's your lover, that's your God, that's the thing that you rely on. That's the thing that has total control over you.

Total control. Now, you see, when he talks about the bales and the foreign gods, he says, ah, this is, this is,  this is real, these are primitive. Well, you see in Romans chapter one, this is the fundamental to the biblical analysis of the human condition. Romans chapter one, God says, all of us, because we will not center on God,  because we would not glorify God, we worship created things rather than the creature,  and we worship and serve them. Now, what is Paul saying?

He's not talking just about ancients, you know, polytheists, animists. He's talking about all of us. And he's saying this. Didn't we say that the character sin was, we refuse to center on God. We refuse to put God in the center.

So what do we do? We have to put something in the center. You have to have something there, but whatever you have, because your center was shaped for God,  because as people continually say, there's a God-shaped hole in you, whatever you put in there,  whatever you make your bottom line, whatever you make your meaning in life,  whatever you make the thing that you must have, whatever it is,  because you put it in God's place, it becomes a God. You can't just like your bottom line. You can't just like the central value of your life.

You are fatally attracted to it. You will do anything to get it, anything. Lover gods, you see. Farring gods, I must go after them. This is a very, very profound analysis.

I hope you see it in every way. Now, somebody says, not wait a minute. What are you talking about? Anything you live for, power or approval or control, or needing to be needed,  or independence, you see, or achievement or work, or romance,  or a personal relationship, or relationships in general,  or one relationship in particular, or the way you look. But everybody's got something that they say,  this is the one in whom's arms I put myself.

This is the one in whom I rest. This is the one who I say, if I have you, then I'll be happy. But I must have you. That's what we're talking about. Now, somebody says, well, listen, I can sort of see this would be true of some people.

I know of obsessed of people. I have heard of fatal attractions. And I also know of religious people, but not me. I'm skeptical. I'm totally skeptical.

I believe in no absolute values of any sort. I'm a complete relativist. I'm totally independent. I believe that I have to create my own reality. You see, therefore I serve nothing.

But that's not true. Your skepticism, look at it. Your skepticism is the one thing you won't question. I can prove it to you. If you really were skeptical of your skepticism, you wouldn't be so skeptical.

I can prove it to you. And look more carefully. Look more carefully. It's the thing you rely on. It's how you face life.

It's the thing that, by which you judge everything else,  it's the thing that you're facing life with. It's the thing that makes you feel good about yourself. It's the thing, look carefully. You have bet your eternal destiny on it. You can't prove there's no God.

And yet you have bet your entire destiny. Oh, my friends, we all have lover gods. We've all got bottom lines. We've all got ultimate concerns. We've all got the things that we say, it's no use.

I must have this. And that's the way you can tell what they are. I got to move on here because you see the first point is you're enslaved. We're enslaved, you know, the power is sin. But why, why are we enslaved?

Because anything that you put in the place where God  should be becomes a God. Anything except the true God, about which you say,  I must have it, becomes a fatal attraction. George McDonald, the old Scottish writers put it this way,  anything that you cannot part with it need is your ruler. Think of that one. Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache.

We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way? And what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing this month,  what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer.

Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer,  Dr. Keller shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us  and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world,  struggling with your own mistakes or choices,  or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world  will help you see how the gospel speaks  to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us. This newly released book, What Is Wrong with the World,  is our thanks for your gift this month  to help gospel and life share the good news of Jesus.

That's gospelandlife.com slash give. Test yourself for a minute. For example, is there anything that if you would lose it,  you would say, I actually talked about this under a different  guys two weeks ago, did we know? Anything that you look at, you say, if I don't have this  or if I lose this or if I fail to get it,  I die, I have nothing to live for. I must have it.

Anything but the true God that you say that about  is more important than God. Anything, what would you ditch God for? Some of you in the past half haven't you? What would you say if God does this to me,  if God lets this happen, then I want nothing to do with God,  whatever that would be, would be more important than God  and would be your God, right? What drives you?

What is it about what you say  if I do not have this, I cannot receive life joyfully? The word must. If you use it about anything but God,  you're under the power of that thing. Right, look at the bottom, look at your depression,  look at your disappointments,  look at your anger, look at your worry. And instead of saying, how can I change my circumstances,  you have to say, look, the reason I'm so worried,  the reason I'm petrified, the reason I'm so discouraged,  is because there's something about which I am saying,  I must have it.

That's why having these emotions. It's at the bottom of everything. The bondage of sin, your idle gods,  your lover gods will always leave you and slay,  but secondly, they will always leave you empty. Look at this passage. Secondly, they will always leave you empty.

Down here verse 27,  they say to wood, you are my father,  and to stone you gave me birth. They have turned their backs to me and not their faces. Yet when they are in trouble, they say, come and save us. Where then are the gods you have made for yourselves? Let them come if they can and save you when you're in trouble.

For you have as many gods as you have towns. Oh, Judah, now what do we learn here? Your lover gods will always leave you empty. Where are the gods when you're in trouble? And let me actually, if you and don't look,  just listen to this.

Just a couple of chapters later,  Jeremiah is preaching again in chapter 4 verse 30. He says the same thing,  but he says it in such a pointy way. He says to his people,  he says, what are you doing a waste of devastated ones? Why dress yourself in scarlet and put on jewels of gold? Why shade your eyes with paint?

You adorn yourself in vain. Your lover's despise you. They seek your life. And what's the teaching here? The teaching is if there's anything in your life about which you say,  besides God, about which you say, I must have this to receive life joyfully.

It controls you. That's the first point, but the second point is  you will never satisfy that lover. Never. Here's what God is saying. Ah, you devastated ones.

Why do you shade your eyes with paint? Why do you deck yourselves with jewels? Your lovers will never be satisfied. They despise your life. They despise you and they seek your life.

You will never satisfy them. I saw a book review about Irving Berlin's life. Irving Berlin. Oh, an awful lot of good songs. His daughter said the trouble was, no matter how much he achieved,  as soon as he achieved something,  he immediately would fall into kind of discouragement.

He says, I'll never be able to do that again. I'll never be able to write a song like that one. The achievement God will never be satisfied. It doesn't matter. You say, if only I get to this level of achievement,  then my lover God will say,  you're acceptable.

You've made it. It will never say that. Never. They despise you. How about the thinness God?

You know, some people have an extreme example of it. It's called eating disorders. But you know what? You'll never, you'll never, ever, ever satisfy the thinness God. You ever read interviews with supermodels.

How they hate the fact that there's, you know,  a half an inch bump on the backside of their, of their, you know,  their shoulder blade. And they just say, there's something wrong with me. You'll never satisfy any of these things. The work God,  when you pick up a child,  newborn and you're the parent,  don't you dare look into its eyes and say,  I will live for this. This is it now.

I've got meaning in life. One of the most awful things about all those stories  about babies having babies,  you know, all the little girls to say,  I want to have this baby. And why? Then I'll have somebody to love. Then I'll have something to live for.

I have nothing in my life. My dear friends,  your children at some time,  even when things go pretty well in children. At some point, your children will despise you. You can't live for that. Now, here's the power of an idol.

They say to wood. They say to stone. Now, the idol makers do not create wood and stone. They take wood and stone and create an idol out of it. See, here's the subtlety.

Here's the power of an idol. They're good things. There's nothing wrong with wood. There's nothing wrong with stone. It's what you do with it.

There's nothing wrong with children. There's nothing wrong with,  with trying to take care of your appearance. There's nothing wrong with work. There's nothing wrong with achievement. See, they're good things.

That's why they're so powerful. God made them good things. They're good in themselves. They have a power of goodness in them. That's really where a lot of their power comes from.

But when you put them,  where only God should go,  when you set them, where only God should go,  it's what you've made out of them  that exhorts an enormous power over you. But they will never be satisfied. Never. What do you want from these? You deck yourself for them.

You say, if only. I mean, why do you work so hard? Why are some of you so driven in so many different ways? You want these idol guys to say something that they never will say. You want them to say,  well done, good and faithful servant.

Enter into the joy of your master. Here's my arms open for you. Come in. You are completely acceptable to me. Never, never.

They say,  you could do better. They always do. And listen, if you want to really see,  Jeremiah says, God says,  if you want to really see  how absolutely bankrupt and how absolutely empty your gods will leave you,  don't test your religion. Don't test your religion when the sun is shining. When you're in trouble, call on your gods.

How can they help you then? You see, an awful lot of you still are out there saying,  you know, I don't know what you're talking about. I have no problems like this. I don't feel, I don't see any fatal attraction in my life. You see, wait till the trouble comes.

Call on your gods then. I'm going to give you three examples. False gods will never help you. These lover gods will never help you in three situations. Three, okay?

Really bad sickness. Bereavement and death and failure, they'll never do it. Look, for example, what if you're really sick? What if you get really sick for a long term or permanently? You're on your back.

There's no God except the true God that can help you there. Are you living for material possessions? Are you living for achievement? Are you living for physical beauty? Are you living for relationships?

So what are you living for? If you become permanently on your back,  every one of those gods will have to desert you. They can't help you with thing there. Only the real God could. Well, you say that may not happen to me.

You're going to get old. Call on your gods then. None of them will come through but the true God. None of them will be able to bring you through. Let's take a look at death.

What do you mean by death? You say, well, I mean this. What if you have a great marriage? What if your spouse is the meaning of your life? What if your spouse is what gives you your joy?

Somebody's going to have to die first. It's something that Kathy and I every so often look at. And we say, you know what? Unless some strange, strange, strange, incredible quincidence,  one of the other is going to be left behind. And if we make, if either of us make the other one our God,  how can our God help us when it's in the casket?

Call on your gods then. The gods that you have made for yourself. Good things that you've turned into. Gods, they will never help you then. Then you'll see.

Then you'll see. You may not know that these are your lover gods  until the sickness comes. Until the death, let me give you one more. Failure, failure. My dear friends, people are continually saying to me,  you know, I guess I know God forgives me, but I failed here.

I failed as a parent. I failed as a spouse. I failed as an employee. I haven't made the grade. I did something wrong.

I can't forgive myself. It sounds so humble, but you know what you mean? I have a God you mean. Higher than the God. Because the fact that the Bible says God forgives me doesn't really see.

I put something over God and now that thing won't forgive me. You know why idols never forgive, never. If the thing you're living for is your work. If the thing you're living for is money. If the thing you're living for is relationships.

If the thing you're living for is morality. I have people coming saying I'm very religious, but I blew it. And now I can't forgive myself. I've gone to Jesus and I know he forgives me, but I can't forgive myself. Then morality is your idol, God.

It's Christianity is your God, not Christ. Religion will never forgive you. No God will ever forgive you. Except the true God. They won't.

They despise you. They seek your life. Call on your gods. The gods that you have made for yourself in time of trouble. And you will see if you can't forgive yourself.

It's because you've got a God higher than God. And no God but God will ever forgive you. Don't you see these things can't help you. I mean if moral achievement is the thing that you're living for,  how can it help you when it's gone? If relationships are the thing you're living for,  how can they help you when they're gone?

Don't you see that? They can never help you in death. They can never help you in failure. They can never help you in sickness and suffering. You know why?

Because they don't exist. They're an extension of yourself. They're an extension of your will, the power. You see they have no life in them. They're just stuck.

They're just stone. They'll never help you when your heart is broken. And if you cannot find any comfort when your heart is broken,  it's because there's something more God than God in your life. Now lastly,  all right. These things leave you enslaved and they leave you empty.

Well how can we be healed? Wonderful. Look at the very end. Verse 31, hear the word of the Lord. Have I been a desert to Israel?

Oh look at this. Look at this. Have I been a desert to Israel or a land of great darkness? Why do my people say we are free to roam? We will come to you no more.

Does a maiden forget her jewelry? Does a bride forget her wedding ornaments? Yet my people have forgotten me. Days without number. Now look here.

Look. What is God saying? He says, listen. Have you ever seen a bride coming down the aisle saying,  oh my gosh, I forgot to put on makeup? Have you ever seen a bride come down the aisle saying,  oh my gosh, you know, I forgot to wear my earrings?

They don't do that. Well maybe, maybe that one. But you know, they don't forget things like that. They don't forget this why. A bride does an awful lot of work  to be as absolutely beautiful as she possibly can be.

And by the way, it's all, I mean,  I've never seen a bride who failed. Never. Never. There's all sorts of ways to hide the parts of you  that's not that attractive. All sorts of ways to highlight the parts of you that are  and you come down looking like a vision  and everybody in the whole auditorium wants to marry you.

Why do you work so hard for that to happen? Because what you want, you're thinking about them  but basically you're thinking about him  and you're coming down to your lover  and you want him to say,  I opened to you. You're so beautiful. I accept you completely. All the barriers are down.

You have complete access. Well done. Enter into my joy. God says, you know how to make yourself acceptable physically  but you don't understand how to do it spiritually. You know why you're working so hard?

You know why you're going after these. You know why you're trying so hard to be pretty. You know why you're trying so hard to be successful. You know why you're trying so hard for these things  for power and for approval and for you're trying to cover your nakedness. You're trying to cover over the sense of inadequacy we all have, right?

You're trying very hard to get someone to say I accept you. Don't you understand? I can be your ornament. I can be your righteousness. I can be your acceptability.

I can do it. Now I don't know what Jeremiah thought. God was talking about. He had a general understanding of it  but we have a specific understanding of it. In chapter five of Ephesians we read,  husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church  and gave himself up for her to make her wholly  cleansing her so as to present her to himself  radiant without stain or wrinkle or any blemish  wholly and blameless.

How does Jesus Christ make you what you've been trying to make yourself  all of your life by going after these lover gods? How does he do it? You know how he does it? He gave herself every other God that despises you and seeks your life. But this God gave, he doesn't seek your life, he gave his life.

This is a God who on the cross was stripped so you could be clothed. He was naked in the dark so that you could be clothed in the light. You see? He was disfigured so you could be beautiful. He was cast out so someone to the Father could say,  well done.

Good and faithful servant. When we believe in him,  all of his great work on the cross becomes ours. His righteousness becomes ours. That's what the Bible says. That's how God can say here,  I don't know how they understood it but we understand it now.

Does a bride forget her ornaments? Does a bride forget her beauty? You have forgotten me. I can be your beauty. Here you are out running around desperately trying to look great,  to get your lover gods, to get others around you to say,  well done, good and faithful servant,  to you're trying to clothe yourself with righteousness so you can never do it.

I and I alone can do it. Do you see what's going on? Do you see what he's saying? A bride forgets, would a bride forget her wedding dress, but you've forgotten me. The most astonishing thing.

When you ever look at anything and say, I must have you. If I don't have that, I die and some of you are doing that right now. That's the reason why you're so discouraged. When you say that, you have completely forgotten or you've never heard of what Jesus did  on the cross for you. He was stripped naked so that you could be clothed.

He's your jewelry. He's that which makes you beautiful. Yes, why God says, am I a desert to you? You don't see what I've done for you. You don't see what I can be to you.

So here's what I say. What you've got to do. Look, I'm not listening. I'm not trying to prove the Christianity is true. I'm just trying to show you there's not even another religion that claims to have a god like this.

Every other god in every other religion, every other god in every other philosophy,  every other god says, do this and you will live. Fail and you will die. We have the only god who says, fail and I will die for you. There's no other religion. Other religions say our god is too great to have died.

Our religion says our god is so great that he died. Every other god seeks your life. This god gives his life for you. I'm not trying to prove the Christianity is true. There's ways of giving the evidence.

I'm just trying to say this is the only religion that even claims to have a god like that. As the great poem goes, other gods were strong but thou was weak. They rode but thou distumble to the throne. And two are wounds only gods wounds can speak. And no god has wounds but thou alone.

The only god that even claims to have wounds. The only god that even claims to give himself for you. Here's what you need to do when you're distressed. Instead of just saying, why am I so distressed? Why does god let this happen to me?

Realize the reason you're so distressed is because there's things about what you're saying. I must have them. Then turn away and say, wait a minute. I don't have to have them. The only thing I have to have is Jesus Christ who is my ornament.

I don't have to use these things to clothe my sense of inadequacy. He's my beauty and he's my righteousness. In other words, say to him what the last, you know the stanza. Oh, you remember the chorus of that hymn? In other words, say, I will arise and go to Jesus.

He will embrace me in his arms. In the arms of my dear Savior, there are 10,000 charms. Don't forget him. Let's pray. Father, as we offer ourselves to you now, we're beginning to see  that things that we looked at in our lives as inexplicable pain and difficult misery  and unexplainable distress.

We're starting to see how it all fits together. It's because the other things that we've gone after besides you,  the things that we've centered our life on,  instead of you, they despise us. They seek our life. We're trying to get them to say, well done. They never will be satisfied.

We will arise. We will go to Jesus. He will embrace us. And there we'll find true rest. We thank you that in him we are radiant, spotless, without staying or wrinkle.

Father, those of us who are here who know this but we're not living it,  we pray that you give us the power to live it and face the weak with it. Those of us here who don't understand this yet,  I pray that you would get after them and they would never give up until they understand it  and rejoice in it as the central fact of their life. And we ask this in Jesus' name.

### 引言：罪的问题

有些人说，世界的根本问题是贫穷。还有人说是糟糕的制度、教育不足或生物学问题，但如果这些都不能完全解释我们在头条新闻和自己内心中看到的破碎呢？在今天的教导中，Tim Keller 看圣经对罪的教导，给我们一个深刻诚实但又令人难以置信的希望的世界观。

我想读给你们我们今天早上的教导所基于的经文。是耶利米书第二章。我们上周开始看这章。这是耶利米对犹大人民的第一篇讲道。主题是罪，我们上周看了这章和讲道的第一部分，这周我们看剩下的部分。耶利米书 2 章 19 到 32 节。

> “你的罪孽必惩罚你，你的背道必责备你。你当知道并看明，离弃耶和华你的神，不存敬畏我的心，是何等的恶事、苦事。这是主万军之耶和华说的。”

**很久以前你就打破了你的轭，撕裂了你的绳索。你说，我不服侍你。的确，在每一个高冈上和每一棵茂盛的树下，你都像妓女一样躺下。**

### 罪的特性

我们上周开始看这个。这是一个非常现代的情境，耶利米在其中说话，因为他的国家，他的社会实际上正在分崩离析。它在政治上崩溃，在心理上、社会上和文化上崩溃。每个人都在问出了什么问题，而讲道的答案，神通过耶利米的答案是，不是经济问题，而是罪。

他开始，我们上周看了，首先谈到罪的特性。我们上周看到的罪的特性在多萝西·塞耶斯的一句简短陈述中得到了美丽的总结，她将罪定义为灵魂的深层内在错位。

> “灵魂的深层内在错位，这是一个美妙的短语。”

**当髋关节或任何种类的骨头错位时，那是什么？问题是什么？它偏离了中心。它没有在它应该在的位置居中。因此，造成了巨大的混乱，肌肉、组织，你看到有所有这些切割和磨损，并且造成了巨大的损害和疼痛。你的髋关节不起作用，你不能走路，你不能移动，你不能移动你的手臂。罪是灵魂的错位。**

### 罪的后果

今天我们要看后果。实际发生了什么？有什么影响？当我们这样做时，实际发生了什么？当然，这些影响是非常严重的。你看，在这段精彩的经文的开头，它说，神说，你的罪孽必惩罚你。你的背道必责备你。

> “你的罪孽必惩罚你。你的背道必责备你。”

**当你告诉一个孩子，不要那样玩玩具，否则它会坏掉。你知道，孩子喜欢玩具。亲爱的，不要那样做。你在违反规则，你会弄坏玩具。如果孩子继续违背你所说的，继续做与他被告知不同的事情，玩具坏了。他在哭泣。父母该怎么做？你没有其他事情要做。他带来了惩罚。他的罪孽惩罚了他。他的背道责备了他，你看。它已经发生了。你没有太多其他事情要做，因为你看，他在第 19 节中说，罪带来了自己的后果。如果你不服从神的话，圣经说，那就够了。你会伤心。你会破坏你的生活。你会破坏你的关系。你会破坏你的灵魂。可怕的后果。**

### 被情人神奴役

那么，这些后果是什么？我们如何破坏事物？一切如何崩溃？事物崩溃。小说说。没错。因为是罪。那么，后果是什么？在这段特定的经文中实际上有两个。提到了两个。它们是在一个美妙的形象下提到的，一个美妙的新隐喻。这个隐喻是这样的。神以一种深刻的方式说，罪使我们爱上其他神。换句话说，我们有情人神。我们有神。我们有偶像，我们爱上了它们。我们有情人神。这些情人神总是会对我们产生两种影响。它们会奴役我们，它们会让我们空虚。它们会奴役我们，它们会让我们空虚。

**你的情人神，一方面，它们带来了束缚。另一方面，它们带来了极大的失望，完全的空虚。**

### 情人神留下的空虚

看看这段经文。其次，它们总是让你空虚。下面第 27 节，他们对木头说，你是我的父亲，对石头说，你生了我。他们背向我，不是面向我。然而，当他们遇到麻烦时，他们说，来拯救我们。你们为自己造的神在哪里呢？让他们来，如果他们能在你遇到麻烦时拯救你。因为你有多少城镇，就有多少神。哦，犹大，现在我们在这里学到了什么？你的情人神总是让你空虚。当你遇到麻烦时，神在哪里呢？

> “你们为自己造的神在哪里呢？让他们来，如果他们能在你遇到麻烦时拯救你。”

**你的情人神总是让你空虚。**

### 从神而来的医治

最后，好吧。这些东西让你被奴役，它们让你空虚。那么我们如何得到医治？太好了。看看最后一节。第 31 节，听耶和华的话。我曾是以色列的旷野吗？哦，看看这个。看看这个。我曾是以色列的旷野吗，或是大黑暗之地吗？为什么我的百姓说我们自由漫游？我们不再归向你。少女会忘记她的珠宝吗？新娘会忘记她的婚饰吗？然而，我的百姓忘记了我，日子无数。

> “我曾是以色列的旷野吗，或是大黑暗之地吗？为什么我的百姓说我们自由漫游？我们不再归向你。”

**神说，你知道如何让自己在外表上被接受，但你不明白如何在灵性上做到这一点。你知道为什么你努力工作吗？你知道为什么你追求这些吗？你知道为什么你努力变得漂亮吗？你知道为什么你努力成功吗？你知道为什么你努力争取这些东西，为了权力和认可，因为你在努力掩盖我们都有的那种不充分感，对吗？你非常努力地让某人说我接受你。你不明白吗？我可以成为你的装饰。我可以成为你的义。我可以成为你的可接受性。我可以做到。**

在以弗所书第五章中我们读到，丈夫要爱妻子，正如基督爱教会，为她舍己，使她成为圣洁，洗净她，以便将她呈现给自己，光辉灿烂，没有污点或皱纹或任何瑕疵，圣洁无瑕。耶稣基督如何使你成为你一生中试图通过追求这些情人神来成为的样子？他是如何做到的？你知道他是如何做到的吗？他舍己，其他所有神都鄙视你并寻求你的生命。但这位神给予，他不寻求你的生命，他给予他的生命。这是一位在十字架上被剥夺的神，以便你可以被穿上。他在黑暗中赤身裸体，以便你可以在光明中被穿上。你看到了吗？他被毁容，以便你可以美丽。他被抛弃，以便有人对父亲说，做得好。忠心的仆人。当我们相信他时，他在十字架上的伟大工作就成为我们的。他的义成为我们的。这就是圣经所说的。这就是神在这里可以说的，我不知道他们是如何理解的，但我们现在理解了。新娘会忘记她的装饰吗？新娘会忘记她的美丽吗？你忘记了我。我可以成为你的美丽。你在外面拼命地试图看起来很棒，试图让你的情人神，让你周围的人说，做得好，忠心的仆人，你在试图用义来装扮自己，所以你永远做不到。我和我一个人可以做到。

> “新娘会忘记她的装饰吗？新娘会忘记她的美丽吗？你忘记了我。我可以成为你的美丽。”

**新娘会忘记她的婚纱，但你忘记了我。最令人惊讶的事情。当你看着任何东西说，我必须拥有你。如果我没有那个，我就死了，你们中的一些人现在正在这样做。这就是为什么你如此沮丧的原因。当你这样说时，你完全忘记了或你从未听说过耶稣在十字架上为你所做的。他被剥光衣服，以便你可以被穿上。他是你的珠宝。他是让你美丽的东西。是的，为什么神说，我对你来说是沙漠吗？你没有看到我为你做了什么。你没有看到我可以成为你的什么。**

让我们祷告。父啊，当我们现在将自己献给你时，我们开始看到我们在生活中看作无法解释的痛苦和困难的痛苦和无法解释的困扰。我们开始看到这一切如何结合在一起。这是因为我们除了你之外追求的其他事物，我们将生活的中心放在这些事物上，而不是你，它们鄙视我们。它们寻求我们的生命。我们试图让它们说，做得好。它们永远不会满足。我们将起来。我们将去耶稣那里。他将拥抱我们。在那里我们会找到真正的安息。我们感谢你，因为在他里面我们是光辉灿烂的，没有污点或皱纹。父啊，那些在这里知道这一点但我们没有活出这一点的人，我们祈求你给我们力量去活出这一点并面对这一周。那些在这里还不明白这一点的人，我祈求你去追求他们，直到他们理解并以此为生活的中心事实而喜悦。我们奉耶稣的名祈求。
