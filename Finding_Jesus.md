### Introduction: Finding Jesus

When someone you know is contemplating life's deepest questions, who am I? What's wrong with the world? What can truly make me whole? Jesus doesn't just give us answers. He gives us Himself. In this month's podcast, Tim Keller looks at how we can share the hope we have in Christ as the answer to a person's search for meaning and purpose.

> "The Gospel changes everything."

**Jesus is the answer to life's deepest questions.**

### Jesus as the Answer to Life's Questions

As you may know, August is going to share month that Gospel and life, and we've curated a wide range of free resources to help you take simple steps to share the Gospel with someone God has put in your life. You can access these resources at gospelonlife.com slash share. We believe God uses small acts to do great things, and we're inviting you to do simple, small acts to go and share the Gospel this month because the Gospel changes everything.

### Jesus' View of Scripture

The reading this morning is from John's Gospel chapter 5 verses 31 to 47. If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true. There's another who testifies my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is true. You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth, not that I accept human testimony, but I mention it that you may be saved. John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light.

**Jesus' claims are astounding.**

### Authority, Unity, and Vitality of the Bible

Jesus believes in the complete authority, unity, and vitality, power of the Bible. The authority, the unity, and the vitality. Look at these three points with me. First of all, he believes in the absolute complete divine authority of the Bible.

- Authority: Jesus viewed the Bible as God's testimony.
- Unity: Jesus saw the Old Testament as pointing to Him.
- Vitality: The Bible gives life through Jesus.

### Conclusion: Understanding Jesus through Scripture

If you are not sure what you believe or whether you believe in Christianity, then you ought to look at what Jesus offers. Jesus says, look at personal, empirical, and scriptural testimony. Personal testimony. He says, look at John the Baptist. You say, well, I don't know John the Baptist. No, but find some, you're never probably going to find faith unless you have some Christians that you admire in respect.

**The Bible points to Jesus, and through Him, we find life.**

Let's pray. Our Father, we ask that you would help us to see why in the Word of the Lord we find the Lord of the Word. It's because of the Lord of the Word that we can believe in the Word of the Lord. We ask that you would enable us now as a church to be people who know how to not only give a good answer when people criticize the authority of the Word, but to show that the Bible to us is not just a body of truth that we defend, but really it's our food, it's our drink, and it's our way of knowing you. Lord, we pray that you would help us to love you through your Word and we pray that you would make your Word alive in our lives. We don't want to be like the people Jesus was talking about, but your Word doesn't dwell on us. We want your Word to dwell on us richly and we pray that you would help us in that regard. Now, through your Holy Spirit, we ask it through Jesus and His name we pray. Amen.

Great Gospel-centered resources. Again, it's all at gospelandlife.com. You can also stay connected with us on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and X. The sermons and talks you hear on the Gospel and Life podcast were recorded between 1989 and 2017, while Dr. Keller was senior pastor at Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

### 引言：寻找耶稣

当你认识的人在思考人生最深刻的问题时，我是谁？世界出了什么问题？什么能真正使我完整？耶稣不仅给我们答案，他把自己给了我们。在本月的播客中，Tim Keller 探讨了我们如何分享我们在基督里的希望，作为一个人寻找意义和目的的答案。

> “福音改变一切。”

**耶稣是生命最深刻问题的答案。**

### 耶稣是生命问题的答案

正如你可能知道的，八月将是福音和生活的分享月，我们策划了广泛的免费资源，帮助你采取简单的步骤与神放在你生命中的人分享福音。你可以在 gospelonlife.com/share 访问这些资源。我们相信神使用小行动来做大事，我们邀请你在这个月做简单的小行动去分享福音，因为福音改变一切。

### 耶稣对圣经的看法

今天早上的阅读来自约翰福音第5章第31到47节。如果我为自己作证，我的见证就不是真的。有另一个人为我作证，我知道他为我作的见证是真的。你们曾派人到约翰那里，他为真理作了见证，我并不接受人的见证，但我提到这点是为了你们得救。约翰是点燃并发光的灯，你们选择了一段时间享受他的光。

**耶稣的主张令人震惊。**

### 圣经的权威性、统一性和生命力

耶稣相信圣经的完全权威、统一性和生命力。权威、统一性和生命力。和我一起看这三点。首先，他相信圣经的绝对完全的神圣权威。

- 权威：耶稣将圣经视为神的见证。
- 统一性：耶稣认为旧约指向他。
- 生命力：圣经通过耶稣给予生命。

### 结论：通过圣经理解耶稣

如果你不确定自己相信什么或是否相信基督教，那么你应该看看耶稣提供的东西。耶稣说，看个人、经验和圣经的见证。个人见证。他说，看约翰的见证。你说，我不认识约翰。不是，但找到一些你尊敬的基督徒，你可能永远不会找到信仰，除非你有一些你尊敬的基督徒。

**圣经指向耶稣，通过他，我们找到生命。**

让我们祷告。我们的父，我们请求你帮助我们看到为什么在主的话语中我们找到话语的主。正因为话语的主，我们才能相信主的话语。我们请求你现在使我们作为一个教会成为知道如何不仅在别人批评话语的权威时给出好答案的人，而且展示圣经对我们来说不仅仅是我们捍卫的真理，而是我们的食物、饮料和我们认识你的方式。主，我们祈求你帮助我们通过你的话语爱你，并祈求你使你的话语在我们的生活中活跃。我们不想成为耶稣所说的那些人，但你的话语不在我们里面。我们希望你的话语丰丰富富地住在我们里面，并祈求你在这方面帮助我们。现在，通过你的圣灵，我们通过耶稣和他的名祈求。阿门。
