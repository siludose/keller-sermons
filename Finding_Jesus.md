## English Transcript / 英文原文

the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you  have eternal life. These are the very scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to  me to have life. I do not accept glory from human beings, but I know you. I know that you do not  have the love of God in your hearts. I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me,  but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept Him.

How can you believe since you  accept glory from one another, but do not seek the glory that comes from the only God? But do not  think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set. If you  believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me. But since you do not believe what he wrote,  how are you going to believe what I say?

The past of which is the Sermonist Base, John 5, is about the Bible. We've been talking about  talking about our faith in public. This is the last week in that series. Next week we begin  an event which is, by the way, an awfully interesting time and good time to invite people perhaps to  come if you have been talking to somebody and they have been showing interest. But when you talk  to people about faith in public, right away the Bible comes up.

Very often people say, first of all,  the Bible today, the Bible is a very nice book filled with good things, but in the end it's a human  book. It's a human book written by human beings. There's contradictions in it. There's things in it  we can't trust anymore, so the Bible has to be filtered. There's some things we can follow, some  things we can't because it's a human book.

What I'd like to show you is what Jesus Christ's  own view of the Scripture is and then we'll apply that. John 5 starts with Jesus healing a man,  a lame man, and then when the crowd gathers he begins to teach them about himself and he makes  some amazing claims. He claims to be the judge of the earth. He claims to be the giver of life  and these claims are pretty astounding. So astounding, some of the people were very angry at him,  verse 18 of chapter 5 says they recognized that he was making himself equal with God.

And so they challenge him. Why should we believe you? That is the context for this first verse which  on the surface looks a little bit surprising. Verse 31 says, if I testify about myself, my testimony is  not true. Now on the surface, it looks like what he's saying is you don't have to believe what I'm  saying.

It's not true, but what he actually is saying is this. In the context of Jewish jurisprudence,  if a claim was made, you had to have two or three corroborating witnesses. You had two or three  corroborating pieces of testimony. And so what Jesus is saying here is he saying, okay, I understand  that my testimony wouldn't be valid. If I'm the only one, my claims right here, if that's the only  testimony you had.

But he says, I got three more than he lists them. First, he lists John the Baptist  who was a very respected prophet. Secondly, he lists his own works. He says in verse 36, I have  testimony way bigger than that of John, for the works that the father has given me to finish,  the very works I am doing testify that the father has sent me. He says, look at my miracles and  eventually look at my death and my resurrection, the works that I'm supposed to finish.

Don't just  listen to what John said, look and don't just even listen to my words, look at my deeds, look at  what I've done, look what I am doing. But then thirdly, he actually says, and the father testifies  through what? Verse 39, 40, the scriptures testify of me. That's the third witness. Now in this  context, he would have been talking about the Old Testament, what we would call the Old Testament.

But notice for us, where do you get the testimony of John, the Baptist today? Where do you get a  chance to look at the works of Jesus Christ, the life and ministry of Jesus Christ? It's in what we  call the New Testament. In other words, every three witnesses, every one of them, Jesus gives us here  is in the scripture. And in the process of looking at what he says here, we learn three things that  Jesus himself believed about the scripture, which I think are very relevant to those of us who  are trying to talk to people about the Bible.

Jesus believes in the complete authority, unity,  and vitality, power of the Bible. The authority, the unity, and the vitality. Look at these three  points with me. First of all, he believes in the absolute complete divine authority of the Bible. Now, to get that, you can go to almost any page, almost to the New Testament.

But look what he says  here. He says in verse 37, the father has testified concerning me. Where? He says, you study the  scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life. They are the scriptures that  testify about me.

Now, when Jesus here, evidently, is calling the Old Testament God's testimony,  he's really just going along with everything else he has said. Jesus' view of the Bible is extraordinarily  important for Christians. Let me just lay out what his view was for a minute. It's actually too  to talk about Jesus' view. A view is an intellectual stance.

But, for example, Jesus said in John  chapter 10, the scripture cannot be broken, can't be disregarded. In Matthew 5, 18, he talks about  not a jot or a tittle of the word of God passing away to all his fulfill. Now, a jot and a tittle  was basically the smallest Hebrew letter and a part of a Hebrew letter. It would be like us saying,  I don't just believe that the general ideas of the Bible are spired, the cross on every t  and the dot on every eye is inspired by God and will not pass away to all his fulfilled. Sometimes Jesus' view of the scripture goes by quickly.

In Matthew chapter 19, when Jesus is  talking about marriage, he quotes Genesis 2, Old Testament Genesis 2, where it says,  a man shall leave his father and cleave to his wife. Jesus in Matthew 19 says, God said that. God said, a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife. But if you go back into  Genesis 2, you'll see that it's the narrator, it's the author of Genesis that says that. And that  means that Jesus says, Jesus believes that whatever a biblical author says, God says,  whatever, which means you can throw your letter, red letter, Bible away.

See, the red letter  Bible implies, well, this is Jesus' words or these are God's words, but then the rest of  Paul's words and David's words and those people. But this is Jesus' words and Jesus himself  doesn't look at the Bible like that at all. But see, for even Jesus to say, every single thing  that any biblical author writes is God's word, every jot, every tittle. That's still a view. If you  want to understand how Jesus really regarded the Bible in his actual life, every time Satan assaulted  him in the wilderness, what's Jesus say?

Go drop a tie. That word is right on your lips,  wasn't it? The Greek word, it is written. Every time Satan assaults him, what does Jesus do? Gets out the scripture.

It is written, quote, scripture. When Peter gets out of a sword,  you know, to defend Jesus when he's being arrested, what does Jesus say? He says, put up your  sword. Don't you know I could call 12 legions of angels, but then how would this scripture be fulfilled? Just amazes me that here's people running around with swords and staves.

There's a riot going on  and Jesus is thinking of this scripture. He's on his way to the cross. He's already been tortured  and he's carrying the cross and he's literally dying. Do you remember on the way to the cross? On the way to Calvary, he meets some women who are weeping and this is in Luke 23 and he says,  daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me.

Weep for yourselves for the prophet,  hath said, and then he quotes Isaiah. He quotes Isaiah. And then, of course, when he actually gets  to the cross, Matthew 27, 45, we talk about it all the time, my God, my God, what has not forsaken me? It's a very, very famous spot in the Bible where Jesus is at the moment of His greatest need. He  says, my God, my God, why has not forsaken me?

He was quoting the scripture. He was quoting Psalm  chapter 22, verse 1. He obviously had the whole Psalm in his mind. Somebody years ago, I can't  remember who said, if you stab Jesus Christ, he bleeds the Bible. It was the very operating principle  of his life.

At every turn he was thinking of the scripture. At every time there was a test,  every time there was a temptation, every time there was darkness in his life, how did he handle it? He handled it through the scripture. He didn't just believe in the full, he did believe in the full  divine plenary inspiration and authority of the Bible. He believed that everything the Bible  said, God said, did he believe that?

Yeah. But beyond that, it was the operating principle of his  life. Now, having said that, what do you say when someone says, well, you know, you Christians,  it's okay to be a Christian, but you really can't take the Bible literally. Now, and I've actually heard Christians who said, or at least professing Christians, who said,  well, I'm a Christian, but I don't take every part of the Bible literally. Some parts of it we  just can't follow anymore.

Now, every thoughtful Christian that hears somebody talk about the  taking the Bible literally has to wince. And the reason you have to wince is because at one level,  no, you don't take the Bible literally exactly. I mean, the point is if the Bible has poetry in it,  where it says God was wrestling with the sea monster, and it's obviously poetry, there it's Hebrew  poetry. It's all laid out that way. You read it as the author wants you to read it.

If the author is  a poet and is trying to make his point through poetry, then you read it as a poet, as a poem,  and you don't necessarily take it literally. Over here, you have Luke. And Luke says, oh,  theophilus, I'm going to write you an account, an orderly account, which is a historical account of  based on eyewitness testimony of what happened in the life of Jesus. And when Luke says,  Jesus Christ rose on the third day, it's obvious that Luke wants us to believe he's  teaching us about something that literally happened. There's a certain sense in which do you take  the Bible literally?

Well, it depends on what the author is trying to say. As soon as you try to,  we live in a sound by culture, and as soon as you try to start to explain that everybody's eyes glaze  over. I think probably a better answer to the question, can you be a Christian and not take all  the Bible literally? Usually what that means is I can be a Christian, but I don't have to follow  every part of the Bible. The answer to that is no.

There's a nice soundbite for you. Two letters. No, why? How could you possibly say you can follow Jesus and then reject one of the main operating  principles of his life? One of the main things he lived and died for.

That is the height of  disingenuousness. Without a belief in the full authority of the Bible, you aren't following  Jesus. You're following somebody that you're calling Jesus. And it's more than that. Every indication is that if you say, well, I believe in God and I want to have a spiritual experience,  but I don't want to have a fully authoritative Bible because there's some parts of it that we  just can't follow anymore.

Just some parts I don't like. Some parts I don't want to accept. In the second season of the old TV Star Trek series, second season. This is way back,  70s, 67s at 1969. There was a very funny, it was a comedic,  an episode called I Mud.

It was about Harry Mud, who was a space scoundrel,  who decided to go to a planet and create a paradise for himself by creating a whole planet filled  with androids. So he built all these androids. Now the majority of the androids look like beautiful  women. But he made one android to look just like his wife that he had left, of course. And his  wife was a scold.

So every other android on the planet, no matter what he said to them,  always said, yes, Lord Mud, Harry Mud, M-U-D-D. That was the name. The name of the episode was I Mud. And everybody on the whole planet never contracted him. He always said, yes, Lord Mud,  yes, Lord Mud, yes, Lord Mud.

Except his wife robot, he would turn her on, and she would start to  scold him. And she would say, hardcore, fenton mud, is that alcohol I smell on your breath? Where have  you been? And then what he would do is he would just push the off button. Where have you, you, you, you?

But he captures Captain Kirk and the Starship Enterprise, and he beams them down. And you know what the plot is? I mean, it was a, it was comedy, it was terrible production values,  but it was, it was a brilliant idea of the plot. He captured them because he was miserable. Why?

He thought he had made himself a paradise in which nobody could contradict him. Nobody could  talk back to him. Nobody could say anything that he didn't like. And he realized he had no  personal relationships at all, and he was dying. He was dying.

He was miserable because if you actually have nobody,  you have nobody to argue with you to push back to make you do things you don't want to do,  to tell you things you don't want to hear. You don't have a personal relationship. They're  just all Android. So he had to capture some people so he could actually wouldn't go crazy. If you have a Bible, they can only say back to you, yes, Lord mud, because you've taken it all out.

When it starts, when God says, where were you? When I laid the foundation of the world,  where were you, you, you, you? Because you've taken it all out. Anything in there that you think is  regressive. Anything that you think, you know, we can't believe anymore.

History has moved on. And this is on the wrong side of history. Okay, it's a free country. You can do it, but you don't  have a God who's a personal God now. You don't have the real Jesus and you don't have a personal God  who can talk back to you, who can tell you things you don't want to hear, who can actually, you know,  wrestle with you.

The power of the scripture is not abstract. It's in Hebrews chapter 12,  verse 5, it's an interesting spot where the Hebrew's writer is quoting, by the way, an Old Testament  text, and he says, have you forgotten the exhortation that argues with you as his children,  then he quotes scripture? That's literally usually the translation goes. Have you forgotten the  excerpt? Have you forgotten the scripture that exhorts you?

But it's a word that means argues  with you. And I remember how helpful it was to me when I realized that one of the ways the scripture  helps me, was it argues with me? You know that place where it says, if God condemns you,  pardon me, if your heart's condemned you, God is greater than your heart. Your heart says,  your, your nothing. God comes in from the scripture and says, no, I love you.

See, we want God to  contradict us there. But if you don't want God to contradict you over here, where it tells you  something you don't want to believe, how are you going to let God contradict you over here? When he tells you, I love you in spite of what your heart says. If you want a real God, if you want a  real Jesus, you've got to have an authoritative scripture. You have to have an authoritative scripture.

Second and third, more briefly actually. Jesus also is teaching here the unity of the scripture. Many people say, well the Bible's a human book and you can see, look at all the contradictions. You Christians, you pick and choose. What about all these rules down here?

Where it says you shouldn't be wearing linen and wool together or you shouldn't be eating this or  you should be offering these sacrifices. You pick and choose to. Nobody follows everything in the  Bible. It's filled with contradictions. Jesus says, Moses wrote of me.

See that? It's a remarkable  statement. Verse 46, if you believe Moses, you would believe me for he wrote about me. All the stuff in Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy attributed to Moses. Surely that's what Jesus is thinking about.

Moses wrote of me. He's looking at those passages. Today we tend to say, oh boy, that's kind of strange, all that stuff about diet and what you can eat  and all that sort of thing. He's looking at all that and he says, do you want to realize that all  those books are about me? Now unless you understand what he's saying here, the Bible will be a kind of  thicket, a tangled thicket of what looks like contradictions.

But if you take what he says,  it really makes sense why. You say, well where did Moses write of me? Scholars have often said,  this doesn't make sense because if you start to look through Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,  Deuteronomy for some specific place where it talks about Jesus, no. But what if you take what Jesus  obviously meant because we know this from what he says to them after his resurrection? What if he says, you need to read all of Moses is about me.

John chapter 1, John the Baptist sees  Jesus and gets it and he says, behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. What's the Lamb? The Lamb was slain at Passover when God was bringing the children of Israel out  of Egypt and so they slew the Lamb and they put the Lamb's blood on the doorpost and the angel of  death passed over and then every year the Passover, they slew it, slay a Lamb and it represents the fact  that somehow God is not making his people pay for their sins. It's somehow there's some atonement  being made and suddenly John the Baptist gets it, hey, Moses's Passover is really about Jesus. He's the Lamb.

He's the one who's going to take away the sins of the world. You get near the end  of John chapter 1 and Jesus looks at Nathaniel and says, you're going to see angels ascending and  descending on the Son of Man. What? In the first book of Moses, Genesis, there's a passage where Jacob  has a dream and he sees a stairway and on it angels are ascending and descending and he realizes  that somehow this is a prediction that God is going to open a passageway between heaven and earth  because the angels represent the presence of God and there'll be a way for us to get the presence  of God in our lives. There'll be a way for us to somehow reunite with God that we are right now  estranged from.

That great, you might say, concrete slab between heaven and earth is going to be  broken through. There's going to be a stairway. There's going to be a way for us to relate to God  and Jesus has the audacity to say to Nathaniel, that stairway was actually about me. I'm the Axis Mundi. I'm the one who's going to unite heaven and earth.

It's because of me and because  of what I'm going to do. Oh, then you move into chapter 2, the wedding feast. Remember? And they  run out of wine. And Jesus says, look at those jars over there which were jars that had water  in them for ceremonial washing.

Why? Because the mosaic law said you have to be clean to come into  the presence of God. And Jesus fills those ceremonial jars with his wine indication is he's what  is he saying. I'm the one my blood is going to purify you. Moses wrote of me, all the ceremonial  stuff was about me in Moses.

That stairway was about me. The Passover lamb was about me. Then you get to the end of chapter 2 and Jesus is cleansing the temple, throwing people out of  the temple, and then what happens? They say, what right have you got to do this? And he says,  tear this temple down in three days and I'll build it back up.

But he was talking about his  resurrection. He was talking about himself. And you know what he's saying? I'm the temple. I'm the place where God and humanity are going to meet again over the toning sacrifice.

And then I mean, I could keep this up. John chapter 3, Jesus is trying to talk to Nicodemus and he  says, as Moses raised up the bronze serpent in the wilderness so that people who looked at it  were saved. So I will be lifted up. You don't have to go looking through Genesis,  Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy to try to find some kind of messianic prophecy. Jesus  says, it's all about me.

It's all about me. The Bible will be a thicket. It'll look like  contradiction. But if you understand it's all pointing to me, then suddenly it becomes this  incredible unity. There's no contradictions in it.

And that leads lastly to the fact of its  vitality. And what do I mean by vitality? Look at this interesting place where Jesus seems to be  telling them that they're both right and wrong about the Bible. Verse 39 and 40,  you study the scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me to have life.

Now look carefully. Are they right and are they wrong about how they handle scripture? Both. First of all, they're wrong because he says you study the scriptures diligently because  you think that in them you have eternal life, but they testify about me and you won't believe in me  and therefore you refuse to come to me to have life. So here's what he's doing.

They're both  right and they're wrong. Eternal life is in the scripture. And yet the message of the scripture  is that through Jesus Christ you get eternal life. So here's what these folks were doing. They  didn't believe in Jesus, but they thought they could still get eternal life through the scripture.

What did that mean? Probably it meant that they believed that by just knowing the scripture and  by obeying the scripture, they were very diligent. They would have been studying it day in and day  out hours a day. They would have memorized it. They would have and they did.

They worked out everything  the Bible said into seven, eight hundred, nine hundred thousand different laws. They did everything  they could to be compliant with it. They tried and they tried and they tried. Now here's  here's the point. The Bible's a divine book.

Not a jot or tittle will pass away unless it's  all fulfilled. It's all God's book. Yet it's possible to believe that and yet to miss the  main message, which is you're not saved by obeying the Bible, but you're saved by the one to whom  everything in the Bible points and what he has done. So if you actually see the Bible and have a  high view of its authority and miss its point and fall into believing that through my study of  it and through my obedience to it, I will be saved. The Bible is just a book to you.

It's just a book. Remember how I sometimes mention how Mark Twain who rejected Christianity used to have this nightmare  about being asleep and waking up and finding this huge Bible on him bigger than him, weighing them  down, crushing him and suffocating him. What a vivid metaphor that is. But you see, frankly, the  Bible, unless you see it's about Jesus, unless you see it's all about Jesus, it will destroy you. It'll either destroy you by making you such guilt over the fact you can't live up to it that you'll  just abandon Christianity or it'll turn you into a Pharisee who only care about praise from others,  not really from God, who are basically saving themselves by actually having their self-esteem rise  as they think of themselves as biblically knowledgeable and obedient, rather than obeying the Bible  out of love for God because they realize that they're saved by grace.

Look, let me finish like this. If you are not sure what you believe or whether you believe in Christianity,  then you ought to look at what Jesus offers. Jesus says, look at personal, empirical, and scriptural  testimony. Personal testimony. He says, look at John the Baptist.

You say, well, I don't know John  the Baptist. No, but find some, you're never probably going to find faith unless you have some  Christians that you admire in respect. That's the personal. Secondly, look at Jesus' actual life. That's the empirical.

Look at his resurrection. Look at what he actually did. Study the New Testament  documents. But then thirdly, the Scripture itself. If you don't use the Bible as an end, but a means  to an end of finding Christ.

If you learn how to stand back and not look so much at everything,  the Bible says only of the details but how the Bible is pointing also to the Lord, then it becomes  something that gives life, clothes like this. I mean, if I sent a scientist friend of mine to  the top of a mountain, I said, I want you to get up there and just see what you can see. If the  person comes back down and says, well, I took some soil samples to try to figure out the consistency  of the soil. I took some samples of the bark of the trees up there. I checked out the visibility.

It looked to me like there was 40% humidity. It was a visibility 3.2 miles, but my guess is that  you could probably from up there see 10.2 miles if the humidity was below. I said, wait a minute,  wait a minute. You've missed the point. When I go up there, the view is astounding.

It restores my  soul. That's what I wanted you to see. I didn't want you to miss the forest for the trees. I didn't  want you to miss the view for the soil samples. It's really quite important that you learn how to  look at who Jesus is because that will give you life.

Even if you say, well, I've got eternal life,  I'm a Christian. Every single day, someone talks about drawing life. By meditating on the word of  God day and night, you're like a tree planted by water, drawing life from it. Do you know how to do  that? The way to do it is to realize Moses wrote of me, the scriptures testify to me.

Everything we know about the authority of the Bible, the unity of the Bible, and the powerful  vitality of the Bible rests on understanding Jesus Christ as the Lord of the Word. Do you know how  to do that? God give you the grace to understand these things and live by them. Let's pray. Our Father, we ask that you would help us to see why in the Word of the Lord we find the Lord  of the Word.

It's because of the Lord of the Word that we can believe in the Word of the Lord. We ask that you would enable us now as a church to be people who know how to not only  give a good answer when people criticize the authority of the Word, but to show that the Bible  to us is not just a body of truth that we defend, but really it's our food, it's our drink,  and it's our way of knowing you. Lord, we pray that you would help us to love you through your  Word and we pray that you would make your Word alive in our lives. We don't want to be like the  people Jesus was talking about, but your Word doesn't dwell on us. We want your Word to dwell  on us richly and we pray that you would help us in that regard.

Now, through your Holy Spirit,  we ask it through Jesus and His name we pray. Amen. Great Gospel-centered resources. Again, it's all at gospelandlife.com. You can also stay connected  with us on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and X.

### 引言：寻找耶稣

当你认识的人在思考人生最深刻的问题时，我是谁？世界出了什么问题？什么能真正使我完整？耶稣不仅给我们答案，他把自己给了我们。在本月的播客中，Tim Keller 探讨了我们如何分享我们在基督里的希望，作为一个人寻找意义和目的的答案。

> “福音改变一切。”

**耶稣是生命最深刻问题的答案。**

### 耶稣是生命问题的答案

正如你可能知道的，八月将是福音和生活的分享月，我们策划了广泛的免费资源，帮助你采取简单的步骤与神放在你生命中的人分享福音。你可以在 gospelonlife.com/share 访问这些资源。我们相信神使用小行动来做大事，我们邀请你在这个月做简单的小行动去分享福音，因为福音改变一切。

### 耶稣对圣经的看法

今天早上的阅读来自约翰福音第5章第31到47节。如果我为自己作证，我的见证就不是真的。有另一个人为我作证，我知道他为我作的见证是真的。你们曾派人到约翰那里，他为真理作了见证，我并不接受人的见证，但我提到这点是为了你们得救。约翰是点燃并发光的灯，你们选择了一段时间享受他的光。

**耶稣的主张令人震惊。**

### 圣经的权威性、统一性和生命力

耶稣相信圣经的完全权威、统一性和生命力。权威、统一性和生命力。和我一起看这三点。首先，他相信圣经的绝对完全的神圣权威。

- 权威：耶稣将圣经视为神的见证。
- 统一性：耶稣认为旧约指向他。
- 生命力：圣经通过耶稣给予生命。

### 结论：通过圣经理解耶稣

如果你不确定自己相信什么或是否相信基督教，那么你应该看看耶稣提供的东西。耶稣说，看个人、经验和圣经的见证。个人见证。他说，看约翰的见证。你说，我不认识约翰。不是，但找到一些你尊敬的基督徒，你可能永远不会找到信仰，除非你有一些你尊敬的基督徒。

**圣经指向耶稣，通过他，我们找到生命。**

让我们祷告。我们的父，我们请求你帮助我们看到为什么在主的话语中我们找到话语的主。正因为话语的主，我们才能相信主的话语。我们请求你现在使我们作为一个教会成为知道如何不仅在别人批评话语的权威时给出好答案的人，而且展示圣经对我们来说不仅仅是我们捍卫的真理，而是我们的食物、饮料和我们认识你的方式。主，我们祈求你帮助我们通过你的话语爱你，并祈求你使你的话语在我们的生活中活跃。我们不想成为耶稣所说的那些人，但你的话语不在我们里面。我们希望你的话语丰丰富富地住在我们里面，并祈求你在这方面帮助我们。现在，通过你的圣灵，我们通过耶稣和他的名祈求。阿门。
