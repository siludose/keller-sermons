## English Transcript / 英文原文

the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you  have eternal life. These are the very scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to  me to have life. I do not accept glory from human beings, but I know you. I know that you do not  have the love of God in your hearts. I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me,  but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept Him.

How can you believe since you  accept glory from one another, but do not seek the glory that comes from the only God? But do not  think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set. If you  believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me. But since you do not believe what he wrote,  how are you going to believe what I say?

The past of which is the Sermonist Base, John 5, is about the Bible. We've been talking about  talking about our faith in public. This is the last week in that series. Next week we begin  an event which is, by the way, an awfully interesting time and good time to invite people perhaps to  come if you have been talking to somebody and they have been showing interest. But when you talk  to people about faith in public, right away the Bible comes up.

Very often people say, first of all,  the Bible today, the Bible is a very nice book filled with good things, but in the end it's a human  book. It's a human book written by human beings. There's contradictions in it. There's things in it  we can't trust anymore, so the Bible has to be filtered. There's some things we can follow, some  things we can't because it's a human book.

What I'd like to show you is what Jesus Christ's  own view of the Scripture is and then we'll apply that. John 5 starts with Jesus healing a man,  a lame man, and then when the crowd gathers he begins to teach them about himself and he makes  some amazing claims. He claims to be the judge of the earth. He claims to be the giver of life  and these claims are pretty astounding. So astounding, some of the people were very angry at him,  verse 18 of chapter 5 says they recognized that he was making himself equal with God.

And so they challenge him. Why should we believe you? That is the context for this first verse which  on the surface looks a little bit surprising. Verse 31 says, if I testify about myself, my testimony is  not true. Now on the surface, it looks like what he's saying is you don't have to believe what I'm  saying.

It's not true, but what he actually is saying is this. In the context of Jewish jurisprudence,  if a claim was made, you had to have two or three corroborating witnesses. You had two or three  corroborating pieces of testimony. And so what Jesus is saying here is he saying, okay, I understand  that my testimony wouldn't be valid. If I'm the only one, my claims right here, if that's the only  testimony you had.

But he says, I got three more than he lists them. First, he lists John the Baptist  who was a very respected prophet. Secondly, he lists his own works. He says in verse 36, I have  testimony way bigger than that of John, for the works that the father has given me to finish,  the very works I am doing testify that the father has sent me. He says, look at my miracles and  eventually look at my death and my resurrection, the works that I'm supposed to finish.

Don't just  listen to what John said, look and don't just even listen to my words, look at my deeds, look at  what I've done, look what I am doing. But then thirdly, he actually says, and the father testifies  through what? Verse 39, 40, the scriptures testify of me. That's the third witness. Now in this  context, he would have been talking about the Old Testament, what we would call the Old Testament.

But notice for us, where do you get the testimony of John, the Baptist today? Where do you get a  chance to look at the works of Jesus Christ, the life and ministry of Jesus Christ? It's in what we  call the New Testament. In other words, every three witnesses, every one of them, Jesus gives us here  is in the scripture. And in the process of looking at what he says here, we learn three things that  Jesus himself believed about the scripture, which I think are very relevant to those of us who  are trying to talk to people about the Bible.

Jesus believes in the complete authority, unity,  and vitality, power of the Bible. The authority, the unity, and the vitality. Look at these three  points with me. First of all, he believes in the absolute complete divine authority of the Bible. Now, to get that, you can go to almost any page, almost to the New Testament.

But look what he says  here. He says in verse 37, the father has testified concerning me. Where? He says, you study the  scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life. They are the scriptures that  testify about me.

Now, when Jesus here, evidently, is calling the Old Testament God's testimony,  he's really just going along with everything else he has said. Jesus' view of the Bible is extraordinarily  important for Christians. Let me just lay out what his view was for a minute. It's actually too  to talk about Jesus' view. A view is an intellectual stance.

But, for example, Jesus said in John  chapter 10, the scripture cannot be broken, can't be disregarded. In Matthew 5, 18, he talks about  not a jot or a tittle of the word of God passing away to all his fulfill. Now, a jot and a tittle  was basically the smallest Hebrew letter and a part of a Hebrew letter. It would be like us saying,  I don't just believe that the general ideas of the Bible are spired, the cross on every t  and the dot on every eye is inspired by God and will not pass away to all his fulfilled. Sometimes Jesus' view of the scripture goes by quickly.

In Matthew chapter 19, when Jesus is  talking about marriage, he quotes Genesis 2, Old Testament Genesis 2, where it says,  a man shall leave his father and cleave to his wife. Jesus in Matthew 19 says, God said that. God said, a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife. But if you go back into  Genesis 2, you'll see that it's the narrator, it's the author of Genesis that says that. And that  means that Jesus says, Jesus believes that whatever a biblical author says, God says,  whatever, which means you can throw your letter, red letter, Bible away.

See, the red letter  Bible implies, well, this is Jesus' words or these are God's words, but then the rest of  Paul's words and David's words and those people. But this is Jesus' words and Jesus himself  doesn't look at the Bible like that at all. But see, for even Jesus to say, every single thing  that any biblical author writes is God's word, every jot, every tittle. That's still a view. If you  want to understand how Jesus really regarded the Bible in his actual life, every time Satan assaulted  him in the wilderness, what's Jesus say?

Go drop a tie. That word is right on your lips,  wasn't it? The Greek word, it is written. Every time Satan assaults him, what does Jesus do? Gets out the scripture.

It is written, quote, scripture. When Peter gets out of a sword,  you know, to defend Jesus when he's being arrested, what does Jesus say? He says, put up your  sword. Don't you know I could call 12 legions of angels, but then how would this scripture be fulfilled? Just amazes me that here's people running around with swords and staves.

There's a riot going on  and Jesus is thinking of this scripture. He's on his way to the cross. He's already been tortured  and he's carrying the cross and he's literally dying. Do you remember on the way to the cross? On the way to Calvary, he meets some women who are weeping and this is in Luke 23 and he says,  daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me.

Weep for yourselves for the prophet,  hath said, and then he quotes Isaiah. He quotes Isaiah. And then, of course, when he actually gets  to the cross, Matthew 27, 45, we talk about it all the time, my God, my God, what has not forsaken me? It's a very, very famous spot in the Bible where Jesus is at the moment of His greatest need. He  says, my God, my God, why has not forsaken me?

He was quoting the scripture. He was quoting Psalm  chapter 22, verse 1. He obviously had the whole Psalm in his mind. Somebody years ago, I can't  remember who said, if you stab Jesus Christ, he bleeds the Bible. It was the very operating principle  of his life.

At every turn he was thinking of the scripture. At every time there was a test,  every time there was a temptation, every time there was darkness in his life, how did he handle it? He handled it through the scripture. He didn't just believe in the full, he did believe in the full  divine plenary inspiration and authority of the Bible. He believed that everything the Bible  said, God said, did he believe that?

Yeah. But beyond that, it was the operating principle of his  life. Now, having said that, what do you say when someone says, well, you know, you Christians,  it's okay to be a Christian, but you really can't take the Bible literally. Now, and I've actually heard Christians who said, or at least professing Christians, who said,  well, I'm a Christian, but I don't take every part of the Bible literally. Some parts of it we  just can't follow anymore.

Now, every thoughtful Christian that hears somebody talk about the  taking the Bible literally has to wince. And the reason you have to wince is because at one level,  no, you don't take the Bible literally exactly. I mean, the point is if the Bible has poetry in it,  where it says God was wrestling with the sea monster, and it's obviously poetry, there it's Hebrew  poetry. It's all laid out that way. You read it as the author wants you to read it.

If the author is  a poet and is trying to make his point through poetry, then you read it as a poet, as a poem,  and you don't necessarily take it literally. Over here, you have Luke. And Luke says, oh,  theophilus, I'm going to write you an account, an orderly account, which is a historical account of  based on eyewitness testimony of what happened in the life of Jesus. And when Luke says,  Jesus Christ rose on the third day, it's obvious that Luke wants us to believe he's  teaching us about something that literally happened. There's a certain sense in which do you take  the Bible literally?

Well, it depends on what the author is trying to say. As soon as you try to,  we live in a sound by culture, and as soon as you try to start to explain that everybody's eyes glaze  over. I think probably a better answer to the question, can you be a Christian and not take all  the Bible literally? Usually what that means is I can be a Christian, but I don't have to follow  every part of the Bible. The answer to that is no.

There's a nice soundbite for you. Two letters. No, why? How could you possibly say you can follow Jesus and then reject one of the main operating  principles of his life? One of the main things he lived and died for.

That is the height of  disingenuousness. Without a belief in the full authority of the Bible, you aren't following  Jesus. You're following somebody that you're calling Jesus. And it's more than that. Every indication is that if you say, well, I believe in God and I want to have a spiritual experience,  but I don't want to have a fully authoritative Bible because there's some parts of it that we  just can't follow anymore.

Just some parts I don't like. Some parts I don't want to accept. In the second season of the old TV Star Trek series, second season. This is way back,  70s, 67s at 1969. There was a very funny, it was a comedic,  an episode called I Mud.

It was about Harry Mud, who was a space scoundrel,  who decided to go to a planet and create a paradise for himself by creating a whole planet filled  with androids. So he built all these androids. Now the majority of the androids look like beautiful  women. But he made one android to look just like his wife that he had left, of course. And his  wife was a scold.

So every other android on the planet, no matter what he said to them,  always said, yes, Lord Mud, Harry Mud, M-U-D-D. That was the name. The name of the episode was I Mud. And everybody on the whole planet never contracted him. He always said, yes, Lord Mud,  yes, Lord Mud, yes, Lord Mud.

Except his wife robot, he would turn her on, and she would start to  scold him. And she would say, hardcore, fenton mud, is that alcohol I smell on your breath? Where have  you been? And then what he would do is he would just push the off button. Where have you, you, you, you?

But he captures Captain Kirk and the Starship Enterprise, and he beams them down. And you know what the plot is? I mean, it was a, it was comedy, it was terrible production values,  but it was, it was a brilliant idea of the plot. He captured them because he was miserable. Why?

He thought he had made himself a paradise in which nobody could contradict him. Nobody could  talk back to him. Nobody could say anything that he didn't like. And he realized he had no  personal relationships at all, and he was dying. He was dying.

He was miserable because if you actually have nobody,  you have nobody to argue with you to push back to make you do things you don't want to do,  to tell you things you don't want to hear. You don't have a personal relationship. They're  just all Android. So he had to capture some people so he could actually wouldn't go crazy. If you have a Bible, they can only say back to you, yes, Lord mud, because you've taken it all out.

When it starts, when God says, where were you? When I laid the foundation of the world,  where were you, you, you, you? Because you've taken it all out. Anything in there that you think is  regressive. Anything that you think, you know, we can't believe anymore.

History has moved on. And this is on the wrong side of history. Okay, it's a free country. You can do it, but you don't  have a God who's a personal God now. You don't have the real Jesus and you don't have a personal God  who can talk back to you, who can tell you things you don't want to hear, who can actually, you know,  wrestle with you.

The power of the scripture is not abstract. It's in Hebrews chapter 12,  verse 5, it's an interesting spot where the Hebrew's writer is quoting, by the way, an Old Testament  text, and he says, have you forgotten the exhortation that argues with you as his children,  then he quotes scripture? That's literally usually the translation goes. Have you forgotten the  excerpt? Have you forgotten the scripture that exhorts you?

But it's a word that means argues  with you. And I remember how helpful it was to me when I realized that one of the ways the scripture  helps me, was it argues with me? You know that place where it says, if God condemns you,  pardon me, if your heart's condemned you, God is greater than your heart. Your heart says,  your, your nothing. God comes in from the scripture and says, no, I love you.

See, we want God to  contradict us there. But if you don't want God to contradict you over here, where it tells you  something you don't want to believe, how are you going to let God contradict you over here? When he tells you, I love you in spite of what your heart says. If you want a real God, if you want a  real Jesus, you've got to have an authoritative scripture. You have to have an authoritative scripture.

Second and third, more briefly actually. Jesus also is teaching here the unity of the scripture. Many people say, well the Bible's a human book and you can see, look at all the contradictions. You Christians, you pick and choose. What about all these rules down here?

Where it says you shouldn't be wearing linen and wool together or you shouldn't be eating this or  you should be offering these sacrifices. You pick and choose to. Nobody follows everything in the  Bible. It's filled with contradictions. Jesus says, Moses wrote of me.

See that? It's a remarkable  statement. Verse 46, if you believe Moses, you would believe me for he wrote about me. All the stuff in Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy attributed to Moses. Surely that's what Jesus is thinking about.

Moses wrote of me. He's looking at those passages. Today we tend to say, oh boy, that's kind of strange, all that stuff about diet and what you can eat  and all that sort of thing. He's looking at all that and he says, do you want to realize that all  those books are about me? Now unless you understand what he's saying here, the Bible will be a kind of  thicket, a tangled thicket of what looks like contradictions.

But if you take what he says,  it really makes sense why. You say, well where did Moses write of me? Scholars have often said,  this doesn't make sense because if you start to look through Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,  Deuteronomy for some specific place where it talks about Jesus, no. But what if you take what Jesus  obviously meant because we know this from what he says to them after his resurrection? What if he says, you need to read all of Moses is about me.

John chapter 1, John the Baptist sees  Jesus and gets it and he says, behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. What's the Lamb? The Lamb was slain at Passover when God was bringing the children of Israel out  of Egypt and so they slew the Lamb and they put the Lamb's blood on the doorpost and the angel of  death passed over and then every year the Passover, they slew it, slay a Lamb and it represents the fact  that somehow God is not making his people pay for their sins. It's somehow there's some atonement  being made and suddenly John the Baptist gets it, hey, Moses's Passover is really about Jesus. He's the Lamb.

He's the one who's going to take away the sins of the world. You get near the end  of John chapter 1 and Jesus looks at Nathaniel and says, you're going to see angels ascending and  descending on the Son of Man. What? In the first book of Moses, Genesis, there's a passage where Jacob  has a dream and he sees a stairway and on it angels are ascending and descending and he realizes  that somehow this is a prediction that God is going to open a passageway between heaven and earth  because the angels represent the presence of God and there'll be a way for us to get the presence  of God in our lives. There'll be a way for us to somehow reunite with God that we are right now  estranged from.

That great, you might say, concrete slab between heaven and earth is going to be  broken through. There's going to be a stairway. There's going to be a way for us to relate to God  and Jesus has the audacity to say to Nathaniel, that stairway was actually about me. I'm the Axis Mundi. I'm the one who's going to unite heaven and earth.

It's because of me and because  of what I'm going to do. Oh, then you move into chapter 2, the wedding feast. Remember? And they  run out of wine. And Jesus says, look at those jars over there which were jars that had water  in them for ceremonial washing.

Why? Because the mosaic law said you have to be clean to come into  the presence of God. And Jesus fills those ceremonial jars with his wine indication is he's what  is he saying. I'm the one my blood is going to purify you. Moses wrote of me, all the ceremonial  stuff was about me in Moses.

That stairway was about me. The Passover lamb was about me. Then you get to the end of chapter 2 and Jesus is cleansing the temple, throwing people out of  the temple, and then what happens? They say, what right have you got to do this? And he says,  tear this temple down in three days and I'll build it back up.

But he was talking about his  resurrection. He was talking about himself. And you know what he's saying? I'm the temple. I'm the place where God and humanity are going to meet again over the toning sacrifice.

And then I mean, I could keep this up. John chapter 3, Jesus is trying to talk to Nicodemus and he  says, as Moses raised up the bronze serpent in the wilderness so that people who looked at it  were saved. So I will be lifted up. You don't have to go looking through Genesis,  Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy to try to find some kind of messianic prophecy. Jesus  says, it's all about me.

It's all about me. The Bible will be a thicket. It'll look like  contradiction. But if you understand it's all pointing to me, then suddenly it becomes this  incredible unity. There's no contradictions in it.

And that leads lastly to the fact of its  vitality. And what do I mean by vitality? Look at this interesting place where Jesus seems to be  telling them that they're both right and wrong about the Bible. Verse 39 and 40,  you study the scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me to have life.

Now look carefully. Are they right and are they wrong about how they handle scripture? Both. First of all, they're wrong because he says you study the scriptures diligently because  you think that in them you have eternal life, but they testify about me and you won't believe in me  and therefore you refuse to come to me to have life. So here's what he's doing.

They're both  right and they're wrong. Eternal life is in the scripture. And yet the message of the scripture  is that through Jesus Christ you get eternal life. So here's what these folks were doing. They  didn't believe in Jesus, but they thought they could still get eternal life through the scripture.

What did that mean? Probably it meant that they believed that by just knowing the scripture and  by obeying the scripture, they were very diligent. They would have been studying it day in and day  out hours a day. They would have memorized it. They would have and they did.

They worked out everything  the Bible said into seven, eight hundred, nine hundred thousand different laws. They did everything  they could to be compliant with it. They tried and they tried and they tried. Now here's  here's the point. The Bible's a divine book.

Not a jot or tittle will pass away unless it's  all fulfilled. It's all God's book. Yet it's possible to believe that and yet to miss the  main message, which is you're not saved by obeying the Bible, but you're saved by the one to whom  everything in the Bible points and what he has done. So if you actually see the Bible and have a  high view of its authority and miss its point and fall into believing that through my study of  it and through my obedience to it, I will be saved. The Bible is just a book to you.

It's just a book. Remember how I sometimes mention how Mark Twain who rejected Christianity used to have this nightmare  about being asleep and waking up and finding this huge Bible on him bigger than him, weighing them  down, crushing him and suffocating him. What a vivid metaphor that is. But you see, frankly, the  Bible, unless you see it's about Jesus, unless you see it's all about Jesus, it will destroy you. It'll either destroy you by making you such guilt over the fact you can't live up to it that you'll  just abandon Christianity or it'll turn you into a Pharisee who only care about praise from others,  not really from God, who are basically saving themselves by actually having their self-esteem rise  as they think of themselves as biblically knowledgeable and obedient, rather than obeying the Bible  out of love for God because they realize that they're saved by grace.

Look, let me finish like this. If you are not sure what you believe or whether you believe in Christianity,  then you ought to look at what Jesus offers. Jesus says, look at personal, empirical, and scriptural  testimony. Personal testimony. He says, look at John the Baptist.

You say, well, I don't know John  the Baptist. No, but find some, you're never probably going to find faith unless you have some  Christians that you admire in respect. That's the personal. Secondly, look at Jesus' actual life. That's the empirical.

Look at his resurrection. Look at what he actually did. Study the New Testament  documents. But then thirdly, the Scripture itself. If you don't use the Bible as an end, but a means  to an end of finding Christ.

If you learn how to stand back and not look so much at everything,  the Bible says only of the details but how the Bible is pointing also to the Lord, then it becomes  something that gives life, clothes like this. I mean, if I sent a scientist friend of mine to  the top of a mountain, I said, I want you to get up there and just see what you can see. If the  person comes back down and says, well, I took some soil samples to try to figure out the consistency  of the soil. I took some samples of the bark of the trees up there. I checked out the visibility.

It looked to me like there was 40% humidity. It was a visibility 3.2 miles, but my guess is that  you could probably from up there see 10.2 miles if the humidity was below. I said, wait a minute,  wait a minute. You've missed the point. When I go up there, the view is astounding.

It restores my  soul. That's what I wanted you to see. I didn't want you to miss the forest for the trees. I didn't  want you to miss the view for the soil samples. It's really quite important that you learn how to  look at who Jesus is because that will give you life.

Even if you say, well, I've got eternal life,  I'm a Christian. Every single day, someone talks about drawing life. By meditating on the word of  God day and night, you're like a tree planted by water, drawing life from it. Do you know how to do  that? The way to do it is to realize Moses wrote of me, the scriptures testify to me.

Everything we know about the authority of the Bible, the unity of the Bible, and the powerful  vitality of the Bible rests on understanding Jesus Christ as the Lord of the Word. Do you know how  to do that? God give you the grace to understand these things and live by them. Let's pray. Our Father, we ask that you would help us to see why in the Word of the Lord we find the Lord  of the Word.

It's because of the Lord of the Word that we can believe in the Word of the Lord. We ask that you would enable us now as a church to be people who know how to not only  give a good answer when people criticize the authority of the Word, but to show that the Bible  to us is not just a body of truth that we defend, but really it's our food, it's our drink,  and it's our way of knowing you. Lord, we pray that you would help us to love you through your  Word and we pray that you would make your Word alive in our lives. We don't want to be like the  people Jesus was talking about, but your Word doesn't dwell on us. We want your Word to dwell  on us richly and we pray that you would help us in that regard.

Now, through your Holy Spirit,  we ask it through Jesus and His name we pray. Amen. Great Gospel-centered resources. Again, it's all at gospelandlife.com. You can also stay connected  with us on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and X.

### English Transcript (for reference)

the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you  have eternal life. These are the very scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to  me to have life. I do not accept glory from human beings, but I know you. I know that you do not  have the love of God in your hearts. I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me,  but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept Him.

How can you believe since you  accept glory from one another, but do not seek the glory that comes from the only God? But do not  think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set. If you  believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me. But since you do not believe what he wrote,  how are you going to believe what I say?

The past of which is the Sermonist Base, John 5, is about the Bible. We've been talking about  talking about our faith in public. This is the last week in that series. Next week we begin  an event which is, by the way, an awfully interesting time and good time to invite people perhaps to  come if you have been talking to somebody and they have been showing interest. But when you talk  to people about faith in public, right away the Bible comes up.

Very often people say, first of all,  the Bible today, the Bible is a very nice book filled with good things, but in the end it's a human  book. It's a human book written by human beings. There's contradictions in it. There's things in it  we can't trust anymore, so the Bible has to be filtered. There's some things we can follow, some  things we can't because it's a human book.

What I'd like to show you is what Jesus Christ's  own view of the Scripture is and then we'll apply that. John 5 starts with Jesus healing a man,  a lame man, and then when the crowd gathers he begins to teach them about himself and he makes  some amazing claims. He claims to be the judge of the earth. He claims to be the giver of life  and these claims are pretty astounding. So astounding, some of the people were very angry at him,  verse 18 of chapter 5 says they recognized that he was making himself equal with God.

And so they challenge him. Why should we believe you? That is the context for this first verse which  on the surface looks a little bit surprising. Verse 31 says, if I testify about myself, my testimony is  not true. Now on the surface, it looks like what he's saying is you don't have to believe what I'm  saying.

It's not true, but what he actually is saying is this. In the context of Jewish jurisprudence,  if a claim was made, you had to have two or three corroborating witnesses. You had two or three  corroborating pieces of testimony. And so what Jesus is saying here is he saying, okay, I understand  that my testimony wouldn't be valid. If I'm the only one, my claims right here, if that's the only  testimony you had.

But he says, I got three more than he lists them. First, he lists John the Baptist  who was a very respected prophet. Secondly, he lists his own works. He says in verse 36, I have  testimony way bigger than that of John, for the works that the father has given me to finish,  the very works I am doing testify that the father has sent me. He says, look at my miracles and  eventually look at my death and my resurrection, the works that I'm supposed to finish.

Don't just  listen to what John said, look and don't just even listen to my words, look at my deeds, look at  what I've done, look what I am doing. But then thirdly, he actually says, and the father testifies  through what? Verse 39, 40, the scriptures testify of me. That's the third witness. Now in this  context, he would have been talking about the Old Testament, what we would call the Old Testament.

But notice for us, where do you get the testimony of John, the Baptist today? Where do you get a  chance to look at the works of Jesus Christ, the life and ministry of Jesus Christ? It's in what we  call the New Testament. In other words, every three witnesses, every one of them, Jesus gives us here  is in the scripture. And in the process of looking at what he says here, we learn three things that  Jesus himself believed about the scripture, which I think are very relevant to those of us who  are trying to talk to people about the Bible.

Jesus believes in the complete authority, unity,  and vitality, power of the Bible. The authority, the unity, and the vitality. Look at these three  points with me. First of all, he believes in the absolute complete divine authority of the Bible. Now, to get that, you can go to almost any page, almost to the New Testament.

But look what he says  here. He says in verse 37, the father has testified concerning me. Where? He says, you study the  scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life. They are the scriptures that  testify about me.

Now, when Jesus here, evidently, is calling the Old Testament God's testimony,  he's really just going along with everything else he has said. Jesus' view of the Bible is extraordinarily  important for Christians. Let me just lay out what his view was for a minute. It's actually too  to talk about Jesus' view. A view is an intellectual stance.

But, for example, Jesus said in John  chapter 10, the scripture cannot be broken, can't be disregarded. In Matthew 5, 18, he talks about  not a jot or a tittle of the word of God passing away to all his fulfill. Now, a jot and a tittle  was basically the smallest Hebrew letter and a part of a Hebrew letter. It would be like us saying,  I don't just believe that the general ideas of the Bible are spired, the cross on every t  and the dot on every eye is inspired by God and will not pass away to all his fulfilled. Sometimes Jesus' view of the scripture goes by quickly.

In Matthew chapter 19, when Jesus is  talking about marriage, he quotes Genesis 2, Old Testament Genesis 2, where it says,  a man shall leave his father and cleave to his wife. Jesus in Matthew 19 says, God said that. God said, a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife. But if you go back into  Genesis 2, you'll see that it's the narrator, it's the author of Genesis that says that. And that  means that Jesus says, Jesus believes that whatever a biblical author says, God says,  whatever, which means you can throw your letter, red letter, Bible away.

See, the red letter  Bible implies, well, this is Jesus' words or these are God's words, but then the rest of  Paul's words and David's words and those people. But this is Jesus' words and Jesus himself  doesn't look at the Bible like that at all. But see, for even Jesus to say, every single thing  that any biblical author writes is God's word, every jot, every tittle. That's still a view. If you  want to understand how Jesus really regarded the Bible in his actual life, every time Satan assaulted  him in the wilderness, what's Jesus say?

Go drop a tie. That word is right on your lips,  wasn't it? The Greek word, it is written. Every time Satan assaults him, what does Jesus do? Gets out the scripture.

It is written, quote, scripture. When Peter gets out of a sword,  you know, to defend Jesus when he's being arrested, what does Jesus say? He says, put up your  sword. Don't you know I could call 12 legions of angels, but then how would this scripture be fulfilled? Just amazes me that here's people running around with swords and staves.

There's a riot going on  and Jesus is thinking of this scripture. He's on his way to the cross. He's already been tortured  and he's carrying the cross and he's literally dying. Do you remember on the way to the cross? On the way to Calvary, he meets some women who are weeping and this is in Luke 23 and he says,  daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me.

Weep for yourselves for the prophet,  hath said, and then he quotes Isaiah. He quotes Isaiah. And then, of course, when he actually gets  to the cross, Matthew 27, 45, we talk about it all the time, my God, my God, what has not forsaken me? It's a very, very famous spot in the Bible where Jesus is at the moment of His greatest need. He  says, my God, my God, why has not forsaken me?

He was quoting the scripture. He was quoting Psalm  chapter 22, verse 1. He obviously had the whole Psalm in his mind. Somebody years ago, I can't  remember who said, if you stab Jesus Christ, he bleeds the Bible. It was the very operating principle  of his life.

At every turn he was thinking of the scripture. At every time there was a test,  every time there was a temptation, every time there was darkness in his life, how did he handle it? He handled it through the scripture. He didn't just believe in the full, he did believe in the full  divine plenary inspiration and authority of the Bible. He believed that everything the Bible  said, God said, did he believe that?

Yeah. But beyond that, it was the operating principle of his  life. Now, having said that, what do you say when someone says, well, you know, you Christians,  it's okay to be a Christian, but you really can't take the Bible literally. Now, and I've actually heard Christians who said, or at least professing Christians, who said,  well, I'm a Christian, but I don't take every part of the Bible literally. Some parts of it we  just can't follow anymore.

Now, every thoughtful Christian that hears somebody talk about the  taking the Bible literally has to wince. And the reason you have to wince is because at one level,  no, you don't take the Bible literally exactly. I mean, the point is if the Bible has poetry in it,  where it says God was wrestling with the sea monster, and it's obviously poetry, there it's Hebrew  poetry. It's all laid out that way. You read it as the author wants you to read it.

If the author is  a poet and is trying to make his point through poetry, then you read it as a poet, as a poem,  and you don't necessarily take it literally. Over here, you have Luke. And Luke says, oh,  theophilus, I'm going to write you an account, an orderly account, which is a historical account of  based on eyewitness testimony of what happened in the life of Jesus. And when Luke says,  Jesus Christ rose on the third day, it's obvious that Luke wants us to believe he's  teaching us about something that literally happened. There's a certain sense in which do you take  the Bible literally?

Well, it depends on what the author is trying to say. As soon as you try to,  we live in a sound by culture, and as soon as you try to start to explain that everybody's eyes glaze  over. I think probably a better answer to the question, can you be a Christian and not take all  the Bible literally? Usually what that means is I can be a Christian, but I don't have to follow  every part of the Bible. The answer to that is no.

There's a nice soundbite for you. Two letters. No, why? How could you possibly say you can follow Jesus and then reject one of the main operating  principles of his life? One of the main things he lived and died for.

That is the height of  disingenuousness. Without a belief in the full authority of the Bible, you aren't following  Jesus. You're following somebody that you're calling Jesus. And it's more than that. Every indication is that if you say, well, I believe in God and I want to have a spiritual experience,  but I don't want to have a fully authoritative Bible because there's some parts of it that we  just can't follow anymore.

Just some parts I don't like. Some parts I don't want to accept. In the second season of the old TV Star Trek series, second season. This is way back,  70s, 67s at 1969. There was a very funny, it was a comedic,  an episode called I Mud.

It was about Harry Mud, who was a space scoundrel,  who decided to go to a planet and create a paradise for himself by creating a whole planet filled  with androids. So he built all these androids. Now the majority of the androids look like beautiful  women. But he made one android to look just like his wife that he had left, of course. And his  wife was a scold.

So every other android on the planet, no matter what he said to them,  always said, yes, Lord Mud, Harry Mud, M-U-D-D. That was the name. The name of the episode was I Mud. And everybody on the whole planet never contracted him. He always said, yes, Lord Mud,  yes, Lord Mud, yes, Lord Mud.

Except his wife robot, he would turn her on, and she would start to  scold him. And she would say, hardcore, fenton mud, is that alcohol I smell on your breath? Where have  you been? And then what he would do is he would just push the off button. Where have you, you, you, you?

But he captures Captain Kirk and the Starship Enterprise, and he beams them down. And you know what the plot is? I mean, it was a, it was comedy, it was terrible production values,  but it was, it was a brilliant idea of the plot. He captured them because he was miserable. Why?

He thought he had made himself a paradise in which nobody could contradict him. Nobody could  talk back to him. Nobody could say anything that he didn't like. And he realized he had no  personal relationships at all, and he was dying. He was dying.

He was miserable because if you actually have nobody,  you have nobody to argue with you to push back to make you do things you don't want to do,  to tell you things you don't want to hear. You don't have a personal relationship. They're  just all Android. So he had to capture some people so he could actually wouldn't go crazy. If you have a Bible, they can only say back to you, yes, Lord mud, because you've taken it all out.

When it starts, when God says, where were you? When I laid the foundation of the world,  where were you, you, you, you? Because you've taken it all out. Anything in there that you think is  regressive. Anything that you think, you know, we can't believe anymore.

History has moved on. And this is on the wrong side of history. Okay, it's a free country. You can do it, but you don't  have a God who's a personal God now. You don't have the real Jesus and you don't have a personal God  who can talk back to you, who can tell you things you don't want to hear, who can actually, you know,  wrestle with you.

The power of the scripture is not abstract. It's in Hebrews chapter 12,  verse 5, it's an interesting spot where the Hebrew's writer is quoting, by the way, an Old Testament  text, and he says, have you forgotten the exhortation that argues with you as his children,  then he quotes scripture? That's literally usually the translation goes. Have you forgotten the  excerpt? Have you forgotten the scripture that exhorts you?

But it's a word that means argues  with you. And I remember how helpful it was to me when I realized that one of the ways the scripture  helps me, was it argues with me? You know that place where it says, if God condemns you,  pardon me, if your heart's condemned you, God is greater than your heart. Your heart says,  your, your nothing. God comes in from the scripture and says, no, I love you.

See, we want God to  contradict us there. But if you don't want God to contradict you over here, where it tells you  something you don't want to believe, how are you going to let God contradict you over here? When he tells you, I love you in spite of what your heart says. If you want a real God, if you want a  real Jesus, you've got to have an authoritative scripture. You have to have an authoritative scripture.

Second and third, more briefly actually. Jesus also is teaching here the unity of the scripture. Many people say, well the Bible's a human book and you can see, look at all the contradictions. You Christians, you pick and choose. What about all these rules down here?

Where it says you shouldn't be wearing linen and wool together or you shouldn't be eating this or  you should be offering these sacrifices. You pick and choose to. Nobody follows everything in the  Bible. It's filled with contradictions. Jesus says, Moses wrote of me.

See that? It's a remarkable  statement. Verse 46, if you believe Moses, you would believe me for he wrote about me. All the stuff in Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy attributed to Moses. Surely that's what Jesus is thinking about.

Moses wrote of me. He's looking at those passages. Today we tend to say, oh boy, that's kind of strange, all that stuff about diet and what you can eat  and all that sort of thing. He's looking at all that and he says, do you want to realize that all  those books are about me? Now unless you understand what he's saying here, the Bible will be a kind of  thicket, a tangled thicket of what looks like contradictions.

But if you take what he says,  it really makes sense why. You say, well where did Moses write of me? Scholars have often said,  this doesn't make sense because if you start to look through Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,  Deuteronomy for some specific place where it talks about Jesus, no. But what if you take what Jesus  obviously meant because we know this from what he says to them after his resurrection? What if he says, you need to read all of Moses is about me.

John chapter 1, John the Baptist sees  Jesus and gets it and he says, behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. What's the Lamb? The Lamb was slain at Passover when God was bringing the children of Israel out  of Egypt and so they slew the Lamb and they put the Lamb's blood on the doorpost and the angel of  death passed over and then every year the Passover, they slew it, slay a Lamb and it represents the fact  that somehow God is not making his people pay for their sins. It's somehow there's some atonement  being made and suddenly John the Baptist gets it, hey, Moses's Passover is really about Jesus. He's the Lamb.

He's the one who's going to take away the sins of the world. You get near the end  of John chapter 1 and Jesus looks at Nathaniel and says, you're going to see angels ascending and  descending on the Son of Man. What? In the first book of Moses, Genesis, there's a passage where Jacob  has a dream and he sees a stairway and on it angels are ascending and descending and he realizes  that somehow this is a prediction that God is going to open a passageway between heaven and earth  because the angels represent the presence of God and there'll be a way for us to get the presence  of God in our lives. There'll be a way for us to somehow reunite with God that we are right now  estranged from.

That great, you might say, concrete slab between heaven and earth is going to be  broken through. There's going to be a stairway. There's going to be a way for us to relate to God  and Jesus has the audacity to say to Nathaniel, that stairway was actually about me. I'm the Axis Mundi. I'm the one who's going to unite heaven and earth.

It's because of me and because  of what I'm going to do. Oh, then you move into chapter 2, the wedding feast. Remember? And they  run out of wine. And Jesus says, look at those jars over there which were jars that had water  in them for ceremonial washing.

Why? Because the mosaic law said you have to be clean to come into  the presence of God. And Jesus fills those ceremonial jars with his wine indication is he's what  is he saying. I'm the one my blood is going to purify you. Moses wrote of me, all the ceremonial  stuff was about me in Moses.

That stairway was about me. The Passover lamb was about me. Then you get to the end of chapter 2 and Jesus is cleansing the temple, throwing people out of  the temple, and then what happens? They say, what right have you got to do this? And he says,  tear this temple down in three days and I'll build it back up.

But he was talking about his  resurrection. He was talking about himself. And you know what he's saying? I'm the temple. I'm the place where God and humanity are going to meet again over the toning sacrifice.

And then I mean, I could keep this up. John chapter 3, Jesus is trying to talk to Nicodemus and he  says, as Moses raised up the bronze serpent in the wilderness so that people who looked at it  were saved. So I will be lifted up. You don't have to go looking through Genesis,  Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy to try to find some kind of messianic prophecy. Jesus  says, it's all about me.

It's all about me. The Bible will be a thicket. It'll look like  contradiction. But if you understand it's all pointing to me, then suddenly it becomes this  incredible unity. There's no contradictions in it.

And that leads lastly to the fact of its  vitality. And what do I mean by vitality? Look at this interesting place where Jesus seems to be  telling them that they're both right and wrong about the Bible. Verse 39 and 40,  you study the scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me to have life.

Now look carefully. Are they right and are they wrong about how they handle scripture? Both. First of all, they're wrong because he says you study the scriptures diligently because  you think that in them you have eternal life, but they testify about me and you won't believe in me  and therefore you refuse to come to me to have life. So here's what he's doing.

They're both  right and they're wrong. Eternal life is in the scripture. And yet the message of the scripture  is that through Jesus Christ you get eternal life. So here's what these folks were doing. They  didn't believe in Jesus, but they thought they could still get eternal life through the scripture.

What did that mean? Probably it meant that they believed that by just knowing the scripture and  by obeying the scripture, they were very diligent. They would have been studying it day in and day  out hours a day. They would have memorized it. They would have and they did.

They worked out everything  the Bible said into seven, eight hundred, nine hundred thousand different laws. They did everything  they could to be compliant with it. They tried and they tried and they tried. Now here's  here's the point. The Bible's a divine book.

Not a jot or tittle will pass away unless it's  all fulfilled. It's all God's book. Yet it's possible to believe that and yet to miss the  main message, which is you're not saved by obeying the Bible, but you're saved by the one to whom  everything in the Bible points and what he has done. So if you actually see the Bible and have a  high view of its authority and miss its point and fall into believing that through my study of  it and through my obedience to it, I will be saved. The Bible is just a book to you.

It's just a book. Remember how I sometimes mention how Mark Twain who rejected Christianity used to have this nightmare  about being asleep and waking up and finding this huge Bible on him bigger than him, weighing them  down, crushing him and suffocating him. What a vivid metaphor that is. But you see, frankly, the  Bible, unless you see it's about Jesus, unless you see it's all about Jesus, it will destroy you. It'll either destroy you by making you such guilt over the fact you can't live up to it that you'll  just abandon Christianity or it'll turn you into a Pharisee who only care about praise from others,  not really from God, who are basically saving themselves by actually having their self-esteem rise  as they think of themselves as biblically knowledgeable and obedient, rather than obeying the Bible  out of love for God because they realize that they're saved by grace.

Look, let me finish like this. If you are not sure what you believe or whether you believe in Christianity,  then you ought to look at what Jesus offers. Jesus says, look at personal, empirical, and scriptural  testimony. Personal testimony. He says, look at John the Baptist.

You say, well, I don't know John  the Baptist. No, but find some, you're never probably going to find faith unless you have some  Christians that you admire in respect. That's the personal. Secondly, look at Jesus' actual life. That's the empirical.

Look at his resurrection. Look at what he actually did. Study the New Testament  documents. But then thirdly, the Scripture itself. If you don't use the Bible as an end, but a means  to an end of finding Christ.

If you learn how to stand back and not look so much at everything,  the Bible says only of the details but how the Bible is pointing also to the Lord, then it becomes  something that gives life, clothes like this. I mean, if I sent a scientist friend of mine to  the top of a mountain, I said, I want you to get up there and just see what you can see. If the  person comes back down and says, well, I took some soil samples to try to figure out the consistency  of the soil. I took some samples of the bark of the trees up there. I checked out the visibility.

It looked to me like there was 40% humidity. It was a visibility 3.2 miles, but my guess is that  you could probably from up there see 10.2 miles if the humidity was below. I said, wait a minute,  wait a minute. You've missed the point. When I go up there, the view is astounding.

It restores my  soul. That's what I wanted you to see. I didn't want you to miss the forest for the trees. I didn't  want you to miss the view for the soil samples. It's really quite important that you learn how to  look at who Jesus is because that will give you life.

Even if you say, well, I've got eternal life,  I'm a Christian. Every single day, someone talks about drawing life. By meditating on the word of  God day and night, you're like a tree planted by water, drawing life from it. Do you know how to do  that? The way to do it is to realize Moses wrote of me, the scriptures testify to me.

Everything we know about the authority of the Bible, the unity of the Bible, and the powerful  vitality of the Bible rests on understanding Jesus Christ as the Lord of the Word. Do you know how  to do that? God give you the grace to understand these things and live by them. Let's pray. Our Father, we ask that you would help us to see why in the Word of the Lord we find the Lord  of the Word.

It's because of the Lord of the Word that we can believe in the Word of the Lord. We ask that you would enable us now as a church to be people who know how to not only  give a good answer when people criticize the authority of the Word, but to show that the Bible  to us is not just a body of truth that we defend, but really it's our food, it's our drink,  and it's our way of knowing you. Lord, we pray that you would help us to love you through your  Word and we pray that you would make your Word alive in our lives. We don't want to be like the  people Jesus was talking about, but your Word doesn't dwell on us. We want your Word to dwell  on us richly and we pray that you would help us in that regard.

Now, through your Holy Spirit,  we ask it through Jesus and His name we pray. Amen. Great Gospel-centered resources. Again, it's all at gospelandlife.com. You can also stay connected  with us on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and X.

### 中文翻译

你们查考圣经，因你们以为内中有永生。给我作见证的就是这经，然而你们不肯到我这里来得生命。我不受从人来的荣耀，但我知道你们。我知道你们心里没有神的爱。我奉我父的名来，你们并不接待我；若有别人奉自己的名来，你们倒要接待他。

你们互相受荣耀，却不求从独一之神来的荣耀，怎能信我呢？不要想我在父面前要告你们，有一位告你们的，就是你们所仰赖的摩西。你们如果信摩西，也必信我，因为他书上有指着我写的话。你们若不信他的书，怎能信我的话呢？

今天讲道的经文基础是约翰福音第5章，是关于圣经的。我们一直在讲在公共场合谈论我们的信仰。这是这个系列的最后一周。下一周我们将开始一个新的主题，顺便说一下，这是一个非常有趣的时机，是个好时候去邀请人们来参加，如果你一直在跟某人谈话，他们表现出兴趣的话。但当你在公共场合跟人们谈论信仰时，圣经的话题马上就会出现。

人们常常首先说，今天的圣经，圣经是一本充满好东西的好书，但归根结底它是一本人写的书。它是人类写的书。里面有矛盾。有些东西我们不能再相信了，所以圣经需要被过滤。有些东西我们可以遵循，有些不能，因为它是人写的书。

我想向你们展示的是耶稣基督自己对圣经的看法，然后我们会应用它。约翰福音第5章开始于耶稣医治一个瘸腿的人，然后当人群聚集时，他开始教导他们关于他自己的事，他做出了一些惊人的宣告。他宣称自己是地上的审判者。他宣称自己是生命的赐予者，这些宣告相当惊人。如此惊人，以至于有些人对他非常愤怒，第5章第18节说他们认识到他使自己与神平等。

于是他们挑战他。我们为什么要相信你？这就是第一节经文的背景，表面上看起来有点令人惊讶。第31节说，我若为自己作见证，我的见证就不真。表面上看，好像他在说你们不必相信我说的话。

这不是真的，但他实际上在说的是这个。在犹太法律的背景下，如果提出一个主张，你必须有两三个佐证的证人。你必须有两三个佐证的证据。所以耶稣在这里说的是，好的，我理解如果我是唯一的证人，我的见证就无效。如果那是你唯一拥有的见证的话。

但他说，我有三个，然后他列举了它们。首先，他列举了施洗约翰，他是一位很受尊敬的先知。其次，他列举了他自己的工作。他在第36节说，我有比约翰更大的见证，因为父交给我要完成的工作，就是我所做的工作，见证父差了我来。他说，看看我的神迹，最终看看我的死和复活，我应该完成的工作。

不要只是听约翰说了什么，看，甚至不要只是听我的话，看看我的行为，看看我做了什么，看看我正在做什么。但第三，他实际上说，父通过什么来作见证？第39、40节，圣经为我作见证。这是第三个见证。现在在这个背景下，他会一直在谈论旧约，我们所说的旧约。

但请注意，对我们来说，今天你在哪里得到施洗约翰的见证？你在哪里有机会看到耶稣基督的工作，耶稣基督的生命和事工？它在我们所说的新约中。换句话说，耶稣在这里给我们的每三个见证，每一个都在圣经中。在查看他在这里所说的话的过程中，我们了解到耶稣自己相信圣经的三件事，我认为这对我们这些试图跟人们谈论圣经的人非常相关。

耶稣相信圣经的完全权威性、统一性和活力、能力。权威性、统一性和活力。跟我一起看这三点。首先，他相信圣经的绝对完全的神圣权威。现在，要理解这一点，你几乎可以翻到新约的任何一页。

但看看他在这里说的话。他在第37节说，父已经为我作见证。在哪里？他说，你们查考圣经，因你们以为内中有永生。给我作见证的就是这经。

现在，当耶稣在这里明显地称旧约为神的见证时，他实际上只是在遵循他所说的一切。耶稣对圣经的看法对基督徒来说是极其重要的。让我只是简单阐述一下他的看法。实际上很难只谈论耶稣的看法。看法是一种智识立场。

但是，例如，耶稣在约翰福音第10章说，圣经是不能废的，不能被忽视的。在马太福音5章18节，他谈到神的话语的一点一画都不会废去，直到都成全了。现在，一点一画基本上是最小的希伯来字母和希伯来字母的一部分。这就像我们说，我不只是相信圣经的一般概念是受默示的，每个t上的横和每个i上的点都是神默示的，在都成全之前不会废去。有时候耶稣对圣经的看法很快就过去了。

在马太福音第19章，当耶稣谈论婚姻时，他引用创世记第2章，旧约创世记第2章，那里说，人要离开父母，与妻子连合。耶稣在马太福音第19章说，神说了那话。神说，人要离开父母，与妻子连合。但如果你回到创世记第2章，你会看到是叙述者，是创世记的作者这么说的。这意味着耶稣说，耶稣相信无论圣经作者说什么，神就说什么，无论什么，这意味着你可以扔掉你的红字圣经了。

看，红字圣经暗示，嗯，这是耶稣的话或这些是神的话，但其余的是保罗的话和大卫的话以及那些人。但这是耶稣的话，耶稣自己根本不是那样看圣经的。但看，即使耶稣说，圣经作者写的每一件事都是神的话，每一点，每一画。那仍然是一个看法。如果你想了解耶稣在他的实际生活中是如何真正看待圣经的，每次撒但在旷野攻击他时，耶稣说什么？

去掉一个字。那个词就在你的嘴边，不是吗？希腊语，经上记着说。每次撒但攻击他，耶稣做什么？拿出圣经。

经上记着说，引用圣经。当彼得拿出剑，你知道，为了保护耶稣，当他被逮捕时，耶稣说什么？他说，收起你的剑。难道你不知道我可以召唤十二营天使，但那样这经文怎能成就呢？真让我惊讶的是，这里有人拿着剑和棍子到处跑。有一场骚乱正在进行，而耶稣却在想着这经文。他在去十字架的路上。他已经被折磨了，他背着十字架，他真的快死了。你还记得在去十字架的路上吗？在去各各他的路上，他遇到一些正在哭泣的妇女，这在路加福音23章，他说，耶路撒冷的女儿们，不要为我哭。

要为你们自己和你们的儿女哭，因为先知说过，然后他引用以赛亚书。他引用以赛亚书。然后，当然，当他实际上到达十字架时，马太福音27章45节，我们一直在谈论这个，我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？这是圣经中非常非常著名的地方，耶稣在他最需要的时刻。他说，我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？

他在引用圣经。他在引用诗篇第22篇第1节。他显然脑子里想着整篇诗篇。有人多年前说过，我记不起是谁了，如果你刺耶稣基督，他流出的是圣经。这是他生命的运作原则。他在每个转折点都在思考圣经。每次有考验，每次有试探，每次他生命中有黑暗，他是如何处理的？他通过圣经来处理。他不只是相信圣经完全的神圣默示和权威。他相信圣经所说的一切，神都说了，他相信吗？

是的。但除此之外，这是他生命的运作原则。现在，说了这些，当有人说，嗯，你知道，你们这些基督徒，当基督徒没问题，但你真的不能从字面上理解圣经时，你怎么说。现在，我实际上听到过基督徒说过，或者至少是自称基督徒的人说过，嗯，我是基督徒，但我不从字面上理解圣经的每一部分。有些部分我们就是不能再遵循了。

现在，每个有思想的基督徒听到有人谈论从字面上理解圣经时都必须畏缩。你必须畏缩的原因是因为在某种程度上，不，你不是完全从字面上理解圣经。我的意思是，关键是如果圣经里有诗歌，它说神在与海怪摔跤，这显然是诗歌，那里是希伯来诗歌。都是那样排列的。你按照作者希望你阅读的方式阅读它。

如果作者是诗人，并试图通过诗歌表达他的观点，那么你把它作为诗人，作为一首诗来读，你不一定从字面上理解它。在这里，你有路加。路加说，哦，提阿非罗，我要给你写一个记述，一个有序的记述，这是根据目击者证词对耶稣生平中发生的事情的历史记述。当路加说，耶稣基督在第三天复活时，很明显路加希望我们相信他在教我们关于真实发生的事情。在某种意义上，你从字面上理解圣经吗？

嗯，这取决于作者试图说什么。我们生活在一个音频文化中，一旦你试图开始解释那个，每个人的眼睛都会呆滞。我认为对这个问题更好的答案可能是，你能成为基督徒而不从字面上理解所有圣经吗？通常这意味着我可以成为基督徒，但我不必遵循圣经的每一部分。答案是不能。

这是给你的一个很好的声音片段。两个字母。不能，为什么？你怎么可能说你可以跟随耶稣，然后拒绝他生命的主要运作原则之一？他为之生死的主要事情之一。

那是极其虚伪的。没有对圣经完全权威的信仰，你就不是在跟随耶稣。你在跟随一个你称之为耶稣的人。不仅如此。每个迹象都表明，如果你说，嗯，我相信神，我想有一个属灵的体验，但我不想有一个完全权威的圣经，因为有些部分我们就是不能再遵循了。

只是有些部分我不喜欢。有些部分我不想接受。在老电视剧《星际迷航》的第二季，第二季。这是很久以前的事了，70年代，67年代到1969年。有一集非常有趣，是喜剧，一集叫《我是马德》。

那是关于哈利·马德的，他是一个太空骗子，他决定去一个星球，通过创造一个充满机器人的星球来为自己创造一个天堂。所以他制造了所有这些机器人。现在大多数机器人看起来像美女。但他让一个机器人看起来就像他离开的妻子一样。他的妻子是个唠叨的人。

所以在这个星球上的其他每个机器人，无论他对他们说什么，总是说，是的，马德大人，哈利·马德，M-U-D-D。那是名字。那一集的名字叫《我是马德》。星球上的每个人都从不反驳他。他总是说，是的，马德大人，是的，马德大人，是的，马德大人。

除了他的妻子机器人，他会打开她，她会开始唠叨他。她会说，硬核，芬顿·马德，那是我闻到你呼吸中的酒精味吗？你去哪儿了？然后他会做的是，他会按下关闭按钮。你去哪儿了，你，你，你？

但他抓住了柯克船长和星际飞船企业号，他把他们传送下来。你知道情节是什么吗？我是说，那是喜剧，制作价值很糟糕，但情节的想法很出色。他抓住他们是因为他很痛苦。为什么？

他以为他为自己创造了一个天堂，在那里没有人能反驳他。没有人能顶嘴。没有人能说任何他不喜欢的话。他意识到他根本没有任何人际关系，他快死了。他快死了。

他很痛苦，因为如果你实际上没有人，没有人跟你争论，反驳你，让你做你不想做的事，告诉你你不想听的事。你就没有人际关系。他们都只是机器人。所以他不得不抓一些人，这样他实际上才不会发疯。如果你有一本圣经，它只能对你说，是的，马德大人，因为你把它都拿掉了。

当它开始时，当神说，我立大地根基的时候，你在哪里？你在哪里，你，你，你？因为你把它都拿掉了。你认为那里面有任何退步的东西。你认为任何东西，你知道，我们不能再相信了。

历史已经前进了。这站在历史的错误一边。好吧，这是个自由国家。你可以这样做，但你现在没有一个是位格神的神。你没有真正的耶稣，你也没有一个能跟你说话的位格神，能告诉你你不想听的事，实际上能，你知道，与你摔跤。

圣经的能力不是抽象的。它在希伯来书第12章第5节，这是一个有趣的地方，希伯来书的作者引用，顺便说一下，一段旧约经文，他说，你们又忘了那劝你们如同劝儿女的话，然后他引用圣经？字面上通常翻译是。你们又忘了圣经吗？你们又忘了劝勉你们的经文吗？

但那是一个意思是与你争论的词。我记得当我意识到圣经帮助我的一种方式时，它对我多么有帮助，是它与我争论吗？你知道那个地方说，如果神定你的罪，原谅我，如果你的心定你的罪，神比你的心大。你的心说，你什么都不是。神从圣经中进来说，不，我爱你。

看，我们希望神在那里反驳我们。但如果你不想让神在这里反驳你，在它告诉你你不想相信的事情的地方，你怎么能让神在这里反驳你？当他告诉你，尽管你的心怎么说，我爱你。如果你想要一个真实的神，如果你想要一个真实的耶稣，你必须有一个权威的圣经。你必须有一个权威的圣经。

第二和第三，实际上更简短。耶稣在这里也教导圣经的统一性。许多人说，嗯，圣经是人写的书，你可以看到，看看所有这些矛盾。你们基督徒，你们挑挑拣拣。这里所有这些规则怎么办？

它说你不应该一起穿麻布和羊毛，或者你不应该吃这个，或者你应该献这些祭。你们也挑挑拣拣。没有人遵循圣经中的一切。它充满了矛盾。耶稣说，摩西写了我。

看到了吗？这是一个了不起的陈述。第46节，你们如果信摩西，也必信我，因为他书上有指着我写的话。创世记、出埃及记、利未记、民数记和申命记中所有归于摩西的东西。当然那是耶稣在想的。

摩西写了我。他在看那些段落。今天我们倾向于说，哦，天哪，那有点奇怪，所有关于饮食和你能吃什么的东西以及诸如此类的事情。他在看所有这些，他说，你想意识到所有那些书都是关于我的吗？现在，除非你理解他在这里说的话，否则圣经将是一种丛林，看起来像矛盾的纠缠的丛林。

但如果你接受他所说的，为什么就真的有意义了。你说，嗯，摩西在哪里写了我？学者们经常说，这没有意义，因为如果你开始在创世记、出埃及记、利未记、民数记、申命记中寻找某个谈论耶稣的具体地方，没有。但如果你接受耶稣显然的意思，因为我们从他复活后对他们说的话中知道这一点呢？如果他说，你需要读所有摩西的书都是关于我的。

约翰福音第1章，施洗约翰看到耶稣，明白了，他说，看哪，神的羔羊，除去世人罪孽的。羔羊是什么？当神将以色列的子民带出埃及时，羔羊在逾越节被杀，所以他们宰杀羔羊，他们把羔羊的血涂在门框上，死亡的天使越过了，然后每年逾越节，他们宰杀，杀一只羔羊，它代表着不知何故神没有让他的百姓为他们的罪付出代价。不知何故有一些赎罪正在进行，突然施洗约翰明白了，嘿，摩西的逾越节羔羊实际上是关于耶稣的。他是羔羊。

他是那个要除去世人罪孽的。你接近约翰福音第1章的结尾，耶稣看着拿但业说，你们将要看见天使上下在人子身上。什么？在摩西的第一本书创世记中，有一段雅各做梦的段落，他看到一个梯子，上面有天使上去下来，他意识到这不知何故是一个预言，神将要打开天地之间的通道，因为天使代表神的同在，我们将有办法在我们的生命中得到神的同在。我们将有办法与我们现在疏远的神重新联合。

天地之间那块伟大的，你可以说，混凝土板将要被突破。将有一个梯子。我们将有办法与神建立关系，耶稣有胆量对拿但业说，那个梯子实际上是关于我的。我是宇宙轴心。我是将要联合天地的那一位。

这是因为我和因为我将要做的事。哦，然后你进入第2章，婚宴。记得吗？他们没酒了。耶稣说，看那边那些缸，那些缸里有水用于仪式清洗。

为什么？因为摩西律法说你必须洁净才能进入神的同在。耶稣用他的酒装满那些仪式缸，表明他在说什么。我是那个，我的血将要洁净你。摩西写了我，摩西中所有仪式的东西都是关于我的。

那个梯子是关于我的。逾越节羔羊是关于我的。然后你到了第2章的结尾，耶稣洁净圣殿，把人赶出圣殿，然后发生了什么？他们说，你有什么权利这样做？他说，你们拆毁这殿，我三日内要再建立起来。

但他说的是他的复活。他说的是他自己。你知道他在说什么吗？我是圣殿。我是神和人类将要再次相遇的地方，在赎罪祭之上。

然后我是说，我可以继续这样做。约翰福音第3章，耶稣试图跟尼哥底母说话，他说，摩西在旷野怎样举蛇，叫人望见就得救。我也要照样被举起来。你不必在创世记、出埃及记、利未记、民数记、申命记中寻找某种弥赛亚预言。耶稣说，都是关于我的。

都是关于我的。圣经将是一个丛林。它看起来像矛盾。但如果你理解它都指向我，那么突然它就变成了这种不可思议的统一。里面没有矛盾。

这最后导致了它的活力这一事实。我说的活力是什么意思？看这个有趣的地方，耶稣似乎在告诉他们，他们对圣经既对又错。第39和40节，你们查考圣经，因你们以为内中有永生。给我作见证的就是这经，然而你们不肯到我这里来得生命。

现在仔细看。他们处理圣经的方式是对的还是错的？两者都有。首先，他们错了，因为他说你们查考圣经，因你们以为内中有永生，但它们为我作见证，你们不信我，因此你们不肯到我这里来得生命。所以这就是他在做的。他们既对又错。永生在圣经中。然而圣经的信息是通过耶稣基督你得到永生。所以这些人在做什么。他们不信耶稣，但他们认为他们仍然可以通过圣经得到永生。

那意味着什么？可能意味着他们相信只要知道圣经和遵守圣经，他们就非常勤奋。他们会日复一日地学习它，每天几个小时。他们会背诵它。他们会，他们做了。

他们把圣经所说的一切制定成七、八百、九十万条不同的律法。他们尽一切可能遵守它。他们努力，努力，努力。现在这是重点。圣经是一本神圣的书。

一点一画都不会废去，除非都成全了。这都是神的书。然而，相信那个却仍然错过主要信息是可能的，主要信息是你不是通过遵守圣经得救的，而是通过圣经中一切所指向的那一位和他所做的得救。所以如果你实际上看到圣经，对它的权威有很高的看法，却错过了它的重点，陷入相信通过我的学习和遵守它，我将得救。圣经对你来说只是一本书。

只是一本书。记得我有时提到马克·吐温拒绝基督教，过去常做这个噩梦，睡着了，醒来发现一本巨大的圣经在他身上，比他还大，压着他，压垮他，让他窒息。那是多么生动的隐喻。但你看，坦率地说，圣经，除非你看到它是关于耶稣的，除非你看到它都是关于耶稣的，它会毁灭你。它要么通过让你对自己无法达到它而产生如此内疚以至于你会放弃基督教来毁灭你，要么它会把你变成一个法利赛人，只关心别人的赞美，而不是真正来自神的赞美，他们基本上通过实际上让他们的自尊上升来拯救自己，因为他们认为自己在圣经知识和顺服方面很好，而不是出于对神的爱来顺服圣经，因为他们意识到他们是因恩典得救的。

看，让我这样结束。如果你不确定你相信什么或你是否相信基督教，那么你应该看看耶稣提供了什么。耶稣说，看个人的、经验的和圣经的见证。个人见证。他说，看施洗约翰。

你说，嗯，我不认识施洗约翰。不，但找一些，除非你有一些你钦佩和尊重的基督徒，否则你永远不会找到信仰。那是个人的。其次，看耶稣的实际生活。那是经验的。

看他的复活。看他实际上做了什么。研究新约文献。但第三，圣经本身。如果你不把圣经作为目的，而是作为找到基督的手段。

如果你学会如何退后一步，不要只看圣经说的每一件事，只看细节，而是看圣经如何也指向主，那么它就会成为赋予生命的东西，像这样结束。我是说，如果我派一个科学家朋友去山顶，我说，我要你上去看看你能看到什么。如果这个人下来说，嗯，我采集了一些土壤样本，试图弄清楚土壤的稠度。我采集了一些上面树木的树皮样本。我检查了能见度。

在我看来，湿度约为40%。能见度是3.2英里，但我猜想如果湿度低于，你可能从那里看到10.2英里。我说，等一下，等一下。你错过了重点。当我上去那里时，景色令人惊叹。

它恢复了我的灵魂。那是我想让你看的。我不想让你只见树木不见森林。我不想让你为了土壤样本错过景色。学会如何看耶稣是谁真的很重要，因为那会给你生命。

即使你说，嗯，我有永生，我是基督徒。每一天，有人谈论汲取生命。通过昼夜默想神的话语，你就像一棵树栽在水边，从中汲取生命。你知道如何做到那一点吗？

做到这一点的方法是认识到摩西写了我，圣经为我作见证。我们对圣经的权威性、圣经的统一性和圣经强大活力的一切认识都建立在理解耶稣基督是道的主之上。你知道如何做到那一点吗？愿神赐予你恩典来理解这些事情并凭此而活。让我们祷告。我们的父，我们祈求你帮助我们看到为什么在主的话语中我们找到道的主。

正是因为道的主，我们才能相信主的道。我们祈求你现在使我们作为一个教会成为不仅在人们批评圣经的权威时能给出好答案的人，而且能表明圣经对我们不只是我们捍卫的一套真理，而是真的是我们的食物，我们的饮料，和我们认识你的方式。主啊，我们祈求你帮助我们通过你的话语来爱你，我们祈求你使你的话语在我们生命中活着。我们不想像耶稣所说的那些人，你的话语不住在我们里面。我们希望你的话语丰丰富富地住在我们里面，我们祈求你在这方面帮助我们。

现在，通过你的圣灵，我们奉耶稣的名祈求。阿们。伟大的以福音为中心的资源。再次，这都在gospelandlife.com。你也可以在Facebook、Instagram、YouTube和X上与我们保持联系。

---

你们查考圣经,因你们以为内中有永生,给我作见证的就是这经。然而你们不肯到我这里来得生命。我不受从人来的荣耀,但我知道你们。我知道你们心里没有神的爱。我奉我父的名来,你们并不接待我;若有别人奉自己的名来,你们倒要接待他。

你们互相受荣耀,却不求从独一之神来的荣耀,怎能信我呢?不要想我在父面前要告你们,有一位告你们的,就是你们所仰赖的摩西。你们如果信摩西,也必信我,因为他书上有指着我写的话。你们若不信他的书,怎能信我的话呢?

这段经文的基础是约翰福音第5章,讲的是关于圣经。我们一直在讨论如何在公开场合谈论我们的信仰。这是该系列的最后一周。下周我们将开始一个新的活动,顺便说一句,这是一个非常有趣的时机,也是邀请人们来参加的好时机,如果你一直在与某人交谈,而他们表现出兴趣的话。但是当你在公开场合与人们谈论信仰时,圣经的话题马上就会出现。

人们经常会说,首先,今天的圣经是一本很好的书,充满了美好的东西,但归根结底它是一本人写的书。它是由人类写成的。里面有矛盾之处。有些东西我们不能再相信了,所以圣经必须被过滤。有些东西我们可以遵循,有些则不能,因为它是一本人写的书。

我想向你们展示的是耶稣基督自己对圣经的看法,然后我们会应用这一点。约翰福音第5章开始时,耶稣医治了一个瘸腿的人,然后当人群聚集时,他开始教导他们关于他自己的事,他做出了一些惊人的宣称。他宣称自己是大地的审判者。他宣称自己是生命的赐予者,这些宣称相当惊人。如此惊人,以至于有些人对他非常愤怒,第5章第18节说他们认识到他使自己与神同等。

于是他们质疑他。为什么应该

我们相信你吗？这就是第一节经文的背景，表面上看起来有点令人惊讶。第31节说，如果我为自己作见证，我的见证就不真实。从表面上看，似乎他在说你不必相信我所说的话。

这不是真的，但他实际上是这样说的。在犹太法律的背景下，如果有人提出主张，你必须有两到三个旁证。你需要有两到三个佐证的证词。所以耶稣在这里说的是，好的，我明白如果只有我一个人，我的见证是无效的。我的主张就在这里，如果那是你拥有的唯一证词的话。

但他说，我还有三个，然后他列举了它们。首先，他列举了施洗约翰，他是一位备受尊敬的先知。其次，他列举了自己的工作。他在第36节说，我有比约翰更大的见证，因为父交给我要完成的工作，就是我正在做的这些工作，证明父差遣了我。他说，看看我的神迹，最终看看我的死和我的复活，我应该完成的工作。

不要只听约翰说了什么，要看，甚至不要只听我的话，看看我的行为，看看我做了什么，看看我正在做什么。但第三，他实际上说，父通过什么来作见证？第39、40节，圣经为我作见证。这是第三个见证人。现在在这个背景下，他指的是旧约，我们所说的旧约。

但请注意，对我们来说，今天你从哪里得到施洗约翰的见证？你从哪里有机会看到耶稣基督的工作，耶稣基督的生平和事工？它在我们所说的新约中。换句话说，每三个见证人，耶稣在这里给我们的每一个都在圣经中。在查看他在这里所说的话的过程中，我们了解到耶稣自己对圣经的三个信念，我认为这对我们这些试图向人们谈论圣经的人来说非常相关。

耶稣相信圣经的完全权威、统一性和活力，圣经的能力。

权威性、统一性和生命力。让我们一起来看这三点。首先，他相信圣经具有绝对完全的神圣权威。要理解这一点，你可以翻到新约几乎任何一页。

但看看他在这里说的话。他在第37节说，父已经为我作见证。在哪里？他说，你们查考圣经，因为你们以为其中有永生。为我作见证的就是这圣经。

现在，当耶稣在这里明显地称旧约为神的见证时，他实际上是在延续他之前所说的一切。耶稣对圣经的看法对基督徒来说极其重要。让我先简要阐述一下他的看法。其实说"看法"这个词还不够准确。看法是一种理智的立场。

但是，例如，耶稣在约翰福音第10章说，圣经不能被废除，不能被忽视。在马太福音5章18节，他谈到神的话语一点一画都不能废去，直到一切都成就了。现在，一点一画基本上是指最小的希伯来字母和希伯来字母的一部分。这就好比我们说，我不只是相信圣经的大致意思是受默示的，圣经中每个t上的横线和每个i上的点都是神所默示的，在一切成就之前都不会废去。有时候耶稣对圣经的看法一闪而过。

在马太福音第19章，当耶稣谈论婚姻时，他引用了旧约创世记第2章，其中说，人要离开父母，与妻子联合。耶稣在马太福音19章说，这是神说的。神说，人要离开父母，与妻子联合。但如果你回到创世记第2章，你会发现那是叙述者说的，是创世记的作者说的。这意味着耶稣认为，圣经作者所说的，就是神说的，无论什么，这意味着你可以把你的红字版圣经扔掉了。你看，红字圣经暗示，嗯，这是耶稣的话或这是神的话，但其余的是保罗的话、大卫的话和其他人的话。但这是耶稣的话，而耶稣自己并不这样看

圣经根本不是那样的。但你看，即使耶稣说，圣经作者所写的每一件事都是神的话语，每一点，每一画。这仍然是一个观点。如果你想了解耶稣在实际生活中是如何真正看待圣经的，每当撒但在旷野攻击他时，耶稣说什么？

赶紧说出来。那个词就在你嘴边，不是吗？希腊语，"经上记着说"。每次撒但攻击他，耶稣做什么？拿出圣经。

经上记着说，引用圣经。当彼得拔出剑，你知道的，在耶稣被捕时要保护他，耶稣说什么？他说，收刀入鞘。难道你不知道我可以呼叫十二营天使吗，但这样的话，这经上的话怎么应验呢？让我惊讶的是，这里有人拿着刀剑和棍棒到处跑。

骚乱正在发生，而耶稣却在想着圣经。他正走向十字架。他已经受过酷刑，正背着十字架，简直快要死了。你还记得在去十字架的路上吗？在去各各他的路上，他遇到一些哭泣的妇女，这是在路加福音23章，他说，耶路撒冷的女儿们，不要为我哭。

要为你们自己哭，因为先知说过，然后他引用以赛亚书。他引用以赛亚书。然后，当然，当他真正到达十字架时，马太福音27章45节，我们经常谈论它，我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？这是圣经中非常非常有名的地方，耶稣在他最需要的时刻。他说，我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？

他在引用圣经。他在引用诗篇第22章第1节。他显然心里记着整篇诗篇。多年前有人说过，我记不清是谁了，如果你刺伤耶稣基督，他流出的是圣经。这是他生命的运作原则。

在每一个转折点他都在思想圣经。每当有试验，每当有试探，每当他生命中有黑暗时，他如何应对？他通过圣经来应对。他不只是相信圣经完全的，他确实相信圣经完全的神圣全备默示和权威。他相信

圣经所说的一切，神所说的一切，他相信吗？

是的。但除此之外，这还是他生活的行事原则。说到这里，当有人说，嗯，你知道的，你们基督徒，做基督徒没问题，但你们真的不能从字面上理解圣经。现在，我实际上听到过基督徒说，或者至少是自称基督徒的人说，嗯，我是基督徒，但我不会从字面上理解圣经的每一部分。圣经的某些部分我们已经不能再遵循了。

现在，每一个有思想的基督徒听到有人谈论从字面上理解圣经时都不得不感到不安。你不得不感到不安的原因是，在某种层面上，不，你确实不会完全按字面意思理解圣经。我的意思是，关键在于，如果圣经中有诗歌，其中说神与海怪搏斗，这显然是诗歌，那是希伯来诗歌。它就是那样编排的。你要按照作者希望你阅读的方式来阅读。

如果作者是诗人，试图通过诗歌来表达他的观点，那么你就把它当作诗歌来读，你不一定要按字面意思理解。而在这里，你有路加福音。路加说，哦，提阿非罗，我要给你写一个记述，一个有序的记述，这是一个历史记述，基于目击者的证词，记录耶稣生平中所发生的事。当路加说，耶稣基督在第三天复活时，很明显路加希望我们相信他在教导我们一件确实发生的事情。在某种意义上，你是否按字面意思理解圣经？

嗯，这取决于作者想要表达什么。我们生活在一个靠声音传播的文化中，一旦你试图开始解释这一点，每个人的眼睛都会呆滞无神。我想对于"你能成为基督徒而不从字面上理解全部圣经吗？"这个问题，可能更好的回答是，通常这句话的意思是我可以成为基督徒，但我不必遵循圣经的每一部分。对此的回答是：不行。

这给你一个简洁的回答。两个字。不行，为什么？你怎么可能说你可以跟随耶稣，然后却拒绝他生命中的一个主要行事原则？他所做的主要事情之一

为之而活、为之而死的耶稣。

这是极其虚伪的做法。如果不相信圣经的完全权威，你就不是在跟随耶稣。你跟随的是一个你称之为耶稣的人。而且还不止于此。所有迹象都表明，如果你说，好吧，我相信上帝，我想要有一种属灵的体验，但我不想要一本完全权威的圣经，因为其中有些部分我们已经无法再遵循了。

只是有些部分我不喜欢。有些部分我不想接受。在老版《星际迷航》系列的第二季，第二季。这是很久以前的事了，70年代，67年到1969年。有一集非常有趣，是喜剧性的，那集叫《我，马德》。

那集讲的是哈里·马德，他是一个太空无赖，决定去一个星球，通过创造一个充满机器人的星球来为自己建造一个天堂。所以他制造了所有这些机器人。这些机器人中的大多数看起来像美丽的女人。但他让一个机器人看起来就像他当然已经离开的妻子。而他的妻子是个爱唠叨的人。

所以在整个星球上，无论他对其他机器人说什么，它们总是说，"是的，马德大人，哈里·马德，M-U-D-D。"那就是名字。那集的名字叫《我，马德》。整个星球上的每个人都从不反驳他。他们总是说，"是的，马德大人，是的，马德大人，是的，马德大人。"

除了他的妻子机器人，他会打开她，她就会开始唠叨他。她会说，"硬核，芬顿·马德，我闻到你呼吸里有酒精味吗？你去哪儿了？"然后他会做的就是按下关闭按钮。"你去哪儿了，你，你，你，你？"

但他抓住了柯克船长和星舰企业号，把他们传送了下来。你知道剧情是什么吗？我的意思是，这是一部喜剧，制作价值很低，但这是一个绝妙的情节构思。他抓住他们是因为他很痛苦。为什么？

他以为他为自己创造了一个没有人能反驳他的天堂。没有人能顶撞他。没有人能说任何他不喜欢的话。然后他意识到他根本没有任何人际关系，他正在死去。他正在死去。

他很痛苦，因为如果你真的

你没有任何人，你没有人与你争辩，没有人反驳你，迫使你做你不想做的事，告诉你不想听的事。你没有一个位格性的关系。他们全都只是机器人。所以他不得不抓一些人，这样他才不会真的发疯。如果你有一本圣经，他们只能对你说"是的，主人"，因为你已经把一切都拿走了。

当它开始时，当上帝说："当我立大地根基的时候你在哪里？你在哪里，你，你，你？"因为你已经把一切都拿走了。任何你认为是倒退的内容。任何你认为，你知道，我们不能再相信的东西。

历史已经前进了。而这是在历史错误的一边。好吧，这是个自由的国家。你可以这样做，但你现在没有一位位格性的上帝了。你没有真正的耶稣，你没有一位能够回应你、能够告诉你不想听的事情、能够真正与你摔跤的位格性上帝。

圣经的力量不是抽象的。在希伯来书第12章第5节，这是一个有趣的地方，希伯来书的作者引用了一段旧约经文，他说："你们岂忘了那作为儿女与你们争辩的劝勉吗？"然后他引用经文。这通常被翻译为："你们岂忘了那劝勉的话吗？你们岂忘了那劝勉你们的经文吗？"

但这个词的意思是"与你争辩"。我记得当我意识到圣经帮助我的方式之一是它与我争辩时，这对我是多么有帮助。你知道那个地方说：如果你的心责备你，对不起，上帝比你的心更大。你的心说，你什么都不是。上帝从圣经中进来说，不，我爱你。

看，我们希望上帝在那里反驳我们。但如果你不想让上帝在这里反驳你，在它告诉你一些你不想相信的事情时，你怎么能让上帝在那里反驳你呢？当他告诉你，尽管你的心这样说，我仍然爱你。如果你想要一位真实的上帝，如果你想要真正的耶稣，你必须拥有一本有权威的圣经。你

必须有一部权威的圣经。

其次和第三，实际上更简要地说。耶稣在这里也教导圣经的统一性。许多人说，圣经是一本人写的书，你可以看到，看看所有这些矛盾。你们基督徒，你们挑挑拣拣。那些规则呢？

那里说你不应该把亚麻和羊毛穿在一起，或者你不应该吃这个，或者你应该献这些祭物。你们也挑拣。没有人遵守圣经中的所有内容。它充满了矛盾。耶稣说，摩西写到了我。

看到了吗？这是一个非凡的陈述。第46节，如果你们信摩西，也必信我，因为他书上有指着我写的话。创世记、出埃及记、利未记、民数记和申命记中所有归于摩西的内容。耶稣当然是在思考这些。

摩西写到了我。他在看那些经文。今天我们倾向于说，哦，天哪，那有点奇怪，所有那些关于饮食和你能吃什么之类的东西。他看着这一切说，你想意识到所有这些书都是关于我的吗？现在，除非你理解他在这里所说的，否则圣经将是一种丛林，一个看起来像矛盾的纠结丛林。

但如果你接受他所说的，这就真的说得通了。你说，摩西在哪里写到了我？学者们经常说，这说不通，因为如果你开始在创世记、出埃及记、利未记、民数记、申命记中寻找某个具体的地方谈到耶稣，没有。但如果你接受耶稣显然的意思，因为我们从他复活后对他们说的话中知道这一点呢？如果他说，你需要把摩西的所有内容都读成是关于我的。

约翰福音第1章，施洗约翰看到耶稣并明白了，他说，看哪，神的羔羊，除去世人罪孽的。什么是羔羊？当神将以色列的儿女带出埃及时，在逾越节宰杀了羔羊，所以他们宰杀羔羊，把羔羊的血涂在门框上，死亡天使就越过了，然后每年逾越节，他们宰杀羔羊，它代表了一个事实，即神以某种方式没有施行他的

人们为他们的罪付出代价。这里面以某种方式有某种赎罪在进行，突然施洗约翰明白了，嘿，摩西的逾越节真正是关于耶稣的。祂就是那羔羊。

祂就是那位要除去世人罪孽的。你到约翰福音第一章快结束的地方，耶稣看着拿但业说，你将要看见天使在人子身上上去下来。什么？在摩西的第一本书创世记中，有一段经文记载雅各做了一个梦，他看见一个梯子，天使在梯子上上去下来，他意识到这在某种程度上是一个预言，神要打开天地之间的通道，因为天使代表神的同在，将会有一条道路让我们得到神在我们生命中的同在。将会有一条道路让我们以某种方式与神重新联合，因为我们现在与神是疏远的。

那个伟大的，你可以说，天地之间的混凝土板将会被打破。将会有一个梯子。将会有一条道路让我们与神建立关系，耶稣竟敢对拿但业说，那个梯子实际上是关于我的。我就是那世界之轴。我就是那位要联合天地的。

这是因为我和因为我将要做的事。哦，然后你进入第二章，婚宴。记得吗？他们的酒用完了。耶稣说，看看那边那些罐子，那些罐子里有水是用来仪式性洗濯的。

为什么？因为摩西律法说你必须洁净才能来到神的面前。耶稣用祂的酒充满那些仪式性的罐子，暗示的是祂在说什么。我就是那位，我的血将要洁净你们。摩西写的是关于我的，所有摩西中的仪式性的东西都是关于我的。

那个梯子是关于我的。逾越节的羔羊是关于我的。然后你到第二章的结尾，耶稣洁净圣殿，把人们赶出圣殿，然后发生了什么？他们说，你有什么权利这样做？祂说，你们拆毁这殿，我三日内要再建立起来。

但祂说的是关于祂的复活。祂说的是关于祂自己。你知道祂在说什么吗？我就是圣殿。

我是神和人类将要再次相遇的地方，在那赎罪的祭上。

然后，我的意思是，我可以继续说下去。约翰福音第3章，耶稣试图与尼哥底母交谈，他说，正如摩西在旷野举起铜蛇，使看它的人得救。我也将被举起来。你不必翻遍创世记、出埃及记、利未记、民数记、申命记去寻找某种弥赛亚预言。耶稣说，这一切都是关于我的。

这一切都是关于我的。圣经会是一片荆棘丛。它看起来会像矛盾。但如果你明白这一切都在指向我，那么突然间它就变成了这种令人难以置信的统一体。其中没有矛盾。

这最后导致了它的活力这一事实。我说的活力是什么意思呢？看看这个有趣的地方，耶稣似乎在告诉他们，他们对圣经的理解既对又错。第39和40节，你们查考圣经，因为你们认为在其中有永生。这些圣经正是为我作见证的，然而你们却不肯到我这里来得生命。

现在仔细看看。他们对待圣经的方式是对的还是错的？两者都是。首先，他们错了，因为他说你们查考圣经，因为你们认为在其中有永生，但它们为我作见证，而你们不相信我，因此你们拒绝到我这里来得生命。所以他在做的是这个。

他们既对又错。永生在圣经中。然而圣经的信息是，通过耶稣基督你得到永生。所以这些人在做什么呢。他们不相信耶稣，但他们认为他们仍然可以通过圣经得到永生。

那意味着什么？可能意味着他们相信只要知道圣经并遵行圣经，他们就非常勤勉。他们会日复一日地学习它，一天好几个小时。他们会记住它。他们会的，而且他们确实做到了。

他们把圣经所说的一切整理成七、八百、九百、一千条不同的律法。他们尽一切努力去

遵守它。他们试了又试又试。现在这里是关键。圣经是一本神圣的书。

一点一画都不会废去，除非全部应验。这完全是神的书。然而，你可能相信这一点，却仍然错过主要的信息，那就是你不是通过遵守圣经而得救，而是通过圣经所指向的那一位以及他所做的事而得救。所以，如果你确实看到圣经并对它的权威性有很高的看法，却错过了它的要点，陷入相信通过我对它的学习和对它的遵守，我就会得救。那么圣经对你来说只是一本书。

它只是一本书。记得我有时提到马克·吐温，他拒绝了基督教，曾经常做这样的噩梦：睡着后醒来，发现一本巨大的圣经压在他身上，比他还大，压着他，粉碎他，使他窒息。这是一个多么生动的隐喻啊。但你看，坦白说，圣经，除非你看到它是关于耶稣的，除非你看到它完全是关于耶稣的，否则它会毁掉你。它要么会因为你无法达到它的要求而产生如此大的罪疚感从而毁掉你，以至于你会放弃基督教，要么它会把你变成一个法利赛人，只在乎别人的称赞，而不是真正来自神的称赞，他们基本上是在拯救自己，因为他们认为自己在圣经知识和顺服上有所成就而提升了自尊，而不是出于对神的爱来遵守圣经，因为他们意识到自己是因恩典而得救的。

听着，让我这样结束。如果你不确定你相信什么，或者你是否相信基督教，那么你应该看看耶稣所提供的。耶稣说，看看个人的、经验的和圣经的见证。个人见证。他说，看看施洗约翰。

你说，好吧，我不认识施洗约翰。不，但是找一些，除非你有一些你钦佩和尊重的基督徒，否则你可能永远不会找到信仰。这就是个人的见证。其次，看看耶稣的实际生活。这是经验性的。

看看他的复活。看看他实际做了什么。研究新约文献。但第三，圣经本身。如果你

不要把圣经当作目的，而是作为寻找基督的方法。

如果你学会退后一步，不要只盯着圣经所说的每一个细节，而是看圣经如何指向主，那么它就会成为赐予生命的东西，像这样的衣服。我的意思是，如果我派我的一位科学家朋友去山顶，我说，我想让你上去看看你能看到什么。如果这个人下来后说，嗯，我采集了一些土壤样本，试图弄清楚土壤的组成成分。我采集了一些那里树木的树皮样本。我检查了能见度。

在我看来，湿度大约是40%。能见度是3.2英里，但我猜测如果湿度低于这个值，你可能从那里能看到10.2英里。我说，等等，等等。你没抓住重点。当我去那里的时候，景色令人惊叹。

它恢复了我的灵魂。这才是我想让你看到的。我不想让你只见树木不见森林。我不想让你为了土壤样本而错过美景。真正重要的是你学会如何看耶稣是谁，因为这会给你生命。

即使你说，嗯，我已经得到了永生，我是基督徒。每一天，有人谈论汲取生命。通过昼夜默想神的话语，你就像一棵栽在水边的树，从中汲取生命。你知道如何做到这一点吗？做到这一点的方法就是认识到摩西写到我，圣经为我作见证。

我们对圣经权威性、圣经统一性和圣经强大生命力的所有认识，都建立在理解耶稣基督是圣言之主的基础上。你知道如何做到这一点吗？愿神赐给你恩典来理解这些事并靠它们生活。让我们祷告。我们的父，我们祈求你帮助我们明白为什么我们在主的话语中找到话语的主。

正是因为话语的主，我们才能相信主的话语。我们祈求你现在使我们成为一个教会，当人们批评圣经的权威性时，我们不仅知道如何给出好的答案，而且能表明圣经对我们来说不是

只是一套我们捍卫的真理，而实际上它是我们的食物，是我们的饮料，是我们认识你的方式。主啊，我们祈求你帮助我们通过你的话语来爱你，我们祈求你让你的话语在我们的生命中活泼有力。我们不想成为耶稣所说的那种人，你的话语没有住在我们里面。我们希望你的话语丰丰富富地住在我们里面，我们祈求你在这方面帮助我们。

现在，通过你的圣灵，我们奉耶稣的名祈求。阿们。丰富的以福音为中心的资源。同样，这一切都在gospelandlife.com上。你也可以通过Facebook、Instagram、YouTube和X与我们保持联系。
