## English Transcript / 英文原文

today's podcast, Tim Keller looks at how Ecclesiastes helps us  face our doubts, fears, and uncertainties, and points us to the lasting hope and significance  we have in Christ. You can read from that with me. I'm going to read in Exodus chapter 1, you have verses 1 to 11. I'm going to read all the way down to 14. So when you get to the bottom of the page, just  wait another eight seconds and it'll be over.

Exodus chapter 3 verses 1 to 14. Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law,  the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the desert and came to Horeb,  the mountain of God. There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire from within a  bush. Moses saw that through the bush, that though the bush was on fire, it did not burn up. So Moses thought, I will go over and see this strange sight, why the bush does not burn up.

When the Lord saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush,  Moses, Moses. And Moses said, here I am. What else do you say? Anyway, I've always wondered,  do not come any closer, God said, take off your sandals for the place where you were standing as  holy ground. Then he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,  and the God of Jacob.

At this, Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at God. The Lord said, I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I've heard them crying out  because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering. So I have come down  to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good  and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey, the home of the Canaanites, Hidites,  Amrites, Parasites, Hivites, and Jebiusites. And now the cry of the Israelites has reached  me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them.

So now go, I am sending you to  Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt. But Moses said to God, who am I,  that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt? And God said, I will be with you,  and this will be the sign to you, that it is I who have sent you. When you have brought the people  out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain. And Moses said to God, suppose I go to the Israelites  and say to them, look, God of your fathers has sent me to you, and they ask me, what is his name?

What shall I tell them? God said, I am who I am. This is what you were to say to the Israelites. I am, has sent me to you. This is God's word.

In the beginning here of the fall, we've been  giving some concepts and some guidelines for people who are searching spiritually,  and it's really, well, not everywhere, but it's certainly a plain fact that it's actually  acceptable, even in a secular urban place like New York City. It's now acceptable to say,  I am a spiritual searcher. I am spiritually searching. If you go to Barnes and Noble and you look  at all the new nonfiction books, which I did recently, there was something like 25% of the first  shelf that I saw that had something to do with God, something to do with spirituality, something to  do with soul, something to do. Here are some of the titles.

Here are two of my favorite titles. One  is called Cyber Grace, searching for God in a digital age, searching for God. Okay, here's another one,  not as funny, but same thing. Besides still waters, and the subtitle was searching for meaning in  an age of doubt. Now, as I read these, or surveyed them, of course in Barnes and Noble, you know,  you can sit down and just read them and just stay there.

But as I was surveying and reading them,  I noticed something, and I noticed that the writers of these books are tremendously conflicted,  that's the right word. And here's where the conflict is. Though 10 years ago, even certainly 20 years  ago, if you are a modern, sophisticated, secular, urban type person here in New York, it would not  have been acceptable. It would not have been respectable to say, I'm a spiritual searcher. Today,  it is very respectable.

It's very almost noble. It's insightful. It's wise to say, I'm a spiritual  searcher, but I've noticed when I read the book, that it is not acceptable. It's acceptable to say,  I'm searching, but it's not acceptable to say, I've found anything. It's one thing to say, I'm  searching for God.

None of these books would be up on the shelf if they said, finding God in an  age of doubt, finding God in a digital age. That's what they're not talking about that. And what's  intriguing is, they're all in this kind of bind. It is a bind. They are searching with a tremendous  sphere of finding.

Not a terrible situation to be in. It would think it has to be far more comfortable  to either search, either not search or define, but not to search, not wanting to find. And the reason  for this, I've been thinking about this, I'm looking at this thing and I'm seeing what they say,  and they feel they say, well, I'm a spiritual searcher, but I'm not one of those people that say,  I've found God. I'm not one of those people that believe you can have certainty anymore. Now, here's my belief on that.

Here's my understanding for what I can tell, and sometimes it comes  right out in the books. Most spiritual searchers have been involved in religious institutions. They  were many of them were raised in churches or synagogues or something else. They have some kind of  religious background. And they found that inside religious institutions, religious people  are more angry, more insecure, more judgmental, more hypocritical.

There's more fighting. There's  more pride and prejudice going on inside religious institutions than outside. And religious people say,  I found God. And we don't want to be like them. Now, I want to put it on the record right here  that I agree that by and large, inside religious organizations, religious societies and religious  bodies, there is more insecurity, anger.

There is more fighting. There is more brutality. There  is more abuse. There is more hypocrisy than outside. I will just come out and say, yes.

And therefore,  it's perfectly understandable why people say, I'm searching. See, there's stuck between the smugness  of the religious people they don't want. And their own deep spiritual emptiness. They're stuck. Is there a way out?

Yeah, I think there's a way out. The way out is this. First of all, you have to  recognize a fallacy. And the fallacy is this. Let me put to you this way.

Imagine John Doe. He's  always getting drunk. Why? Well, on Monday night, he got drunk on gin and soda water. On Tuesday night,  he got drunk on vodka and soda water.

On Wednesday night, he got drunk on bourbon and soda water. What is it that's making him drunk? Obviously, the common factor, soda water. That must be what's  making him drunk. Right?

No. Of course not. And yet, here's a narrow person and they think they found  God. Here's a narrow person. They think they found God.

Here's a narrow person. Association is not causation. And for a person who's very narrow and condemning to say,  I found God, doesn't mean at all that the judgmental attitude is caused by the conviction of finding  God. And yet, that's the assumption. It could be that you see there's something else causing it.

There's something else besides religious certainty that they found God. There might be some other  cause. And if that's true, and you get over that fallacy, you can finally go to the book,  which is five far, the most likely book, to tell you something about God. And that's the Bible. In fact, if you go to the Old Testament where you have Judaism and Islam and Christianity,  you put those three together and you have three quarters of the human race or something like that  in terms of the people's tradition.

If you take a look at all that,  you see, they all take a look at the Old Testament and they all say, this is sacred. The only intelligent way to find out how do I find God is to go to the Bible first at least. And when you go to the Bible, you'll see the Bible says you can find God,  not just search for God, but find God. And this particular passage that I read where Moses finds  God is really very, very important because it really gives you all the basic principles. There's three things that we see here, not exactly three things.

There's actually the same thing  looked at more and more deeply. There's burning bush. At first, it's a distracting,  disrupting site. At first, all it is to Moses is a disrupting site. When it gets closer, he sees  it's an unmanageable power.

And when it gets even closer, he sees there's a burning angel in the  middle. And I would like to say to you, as you see each of these three, you are going to pass  through the stages through which you have to go to find God. You have to see the same three  things. You have to know and experience the same three things. What are they?

I'll summarize  at the end. Phenomenally, that means when I'm looking at it from the outside, first of all,  we look at it and it's just a disrupting site. It takes him out of his normal course of action. Then he goes in closer and he sees it's an unmanageable power. And then last of all, he sees  there's a burning angel in the middle of it.

Until you see all three things, until the same  three things happen to you, you can't find God. Now, let's take a look at the three things. Each one  is a stage. First, first of all, the burning bush is a disrupting event. Now, what I mean by  disrupting, notice it says here in verse three and four, says Moses saw that though the bush was  on fire, it did not burn up.

So he said, I will go over and see it. And verse four says the Lord saw  that he had gone over to look. And then he spoke. Now, the word gone over is not a very good translation. This is one of the places where our translation, I think, fails us.

Because we have a very specific  word here that's used twice. And the much better translation would be turn aside. It's a word  that's used in Hebrew to mean go off the beaten path, go off the normal path, go off the main road. Moses was just, what was he doing? He was just moving his flock around.

He was doing his thing. He  was an ordinary life. And unless something came to disrupt ordinary life, he would never have  started to search for God. You know, Moses doesn't say, I think I'll search for God today. Something  has to disrupt him and turn him aside from the normal path because the Bible tells us, ordinary life  makes you too busy and this inclines you to search for God.

What do I mean? Well, you know,  see us Lewis in his book on the screw tape letters. It's a lot of fun. It's a fun thing to read if  you've never read it. It's a quick read.

And it's a fiction book, I hope. And it's about a senior  devil writing letters to his nephew, a junior devil, who's still out on the tempting field. A  senior devil's name, screw tape. Screw tape is a retirement, sort of at least he's up higher in  the bureaucracy now of hell. And, you know, he's giving advice to his nephew.

And he starts to tell  his nephew one of the best ways to make sure that your patient, he calls him, never falls into  the clutches of the enemy, which of course is Jesus. And here's what he says, he says, the trouble  about argument is that it moves the whole struggle onto the enemy's ground. By the very act of  arguing, you awake the patient's reason. And once it's awake, who can foresee the result? Even if a particular strain of thought can be twisted to end in our favor, you will find that  you have been strengthening in your patient the fatal habit of attending to universal issues.

And with drawing attention from the stream of immediate sense experiences, your business  is to fix his attention on that stream. Teach him to call it real life. And don't let him ask what  he means by real. Remember, he's not like you. He's not a pure spirit.

You don't realize how  enslaved these humans are to the pressure of the ordinary. I once had a patient, a sound atheist  who used to read in the British Museum one day, as he sat reading, I saw a train of thought in his  mind beginning to go the wrong way. The enemy, of course, was at his elbow. Before I knew where I was,  I saw my 20 years of great, hard work beginning to totter. If I had lost my head and begun to attempt  a defense by argument, I should have been undone.

But I was not such a fool. I immediately suggested  it was just about time he has some lunch. The enemy presumably made the counter suggestion,  you know how one can never quite over hear what he says to them, that this was more important than  lunch. At least I think that must have been his line for when I said quite. In fact, it's much  too important to tackle at the end of the morning.

The patient brightened up considerably and by the  time I had added much better, come back after lunch and go into it with a fresh mind, he was already  halfway to the door. Once he was in the street, the battle was won. I showed him a newsboy shouting  the midday paper. I showed him a number 73 bus going past as usual. And before he reached the  bottom of the steps, I had gotten into him the unalterable conviction that whatever odd ideas may come  up into a man's head when he's a shut up alone with his books.

A healthy dose of real life by which  he meant the bus and the newsboy I imagine was enough to show him that all that sort of thing just  couldn't be true. He knew he'd had a narrow escape and in later years was fond of talking about  that inarticulate sense of actuality which is our ultimate safeguard against the aberrations of  mirror logic. He is now safe in our father's house below. We're never going to search for God as long  as we're in ordinary life. We're just busy.

We're just carried along. Sense experience keeps us from  asking the question, why am I so busy? What am I doing? What is it accomplishing? What's the  purpose of it all?

What is my life accomplishing? What is it all amounting to? We never asked  that question. We're too busy in ordinary life. Something has to turn us aside.

We'll never do  it on our own. Something has to come and turn us aside or we're stuck. And what is that thing that  has to turn us aside? It's got to be a burning bush. He turned aside and to see the strange sight.

Now, what is a burning bush? The burning bush is something that contradicts the model or view of  reality that you've got. A burning bush is something that is actually a paradigm bomb. It comes inside  your paradigm of what things should be like and it explodes it. Now I'll tell you how a burning  bush works.

The burning bush works like this. If such and such is true, which I think it is,  then such things couldn't happen. But there's one of those things. Therefore such and such can't be true. Got that?

See, I believe such and such. And if such and such, then this can't be, this can never  happen. But this just happened. Therefore such and such can't be true. That's a burning bush.

See,  in this case, if you're empiricist, if you're somebody who says, well, I just believe in what's  here and now, I believe that everything is a natural cause. I don't believe in the supernatural. I  don't believe in mystical things. I just believe everything is a natural cause. Oh, what's a burning  bush?

It's a contradiction. Because a bush is either burning and it's disintegrating  or it's cold and it's intact, but this is a bush that burns and is not consumed. And that means  that there's something more to life and reality. If you don't have a supernatural  view of reality, the burning bush is a paradigm bomb. If this world is all there is, then burning  bushes can't happen.

A burning bush has happened. Therefore, there must be something more to my  view. But my review of reality has to change. Now, a burning bush is the only thing that ever gets  us out of ordinary life and makes us turn aside and think about it and concentrate on it and ask  the big questions. See, now what form is going to burning bush come in?

Oh, my many, many forms,  many forms. Let me give you four quick ones, but they're very important. I mean, this is one of  the main things that this tells us. You'll never find God just by abstractly one day saying,  I think it's about time I'm 35. I should go find God.

That'll never happen. You're stuck  in the stream of ordinary life. Something's got to turn you aside and these are the things that  turn you aside. Let me give you a quick example. Four, one is an inexplicable person can be a burning  bush.

One of my favorite illustrations on this is a woman who this actually is in a book somewhere  I have to go find it, but there's a woman who told how she'd come to Redeemer back in the early days  when Redeemer was rather small. She was someone who never thought much about religion was an  interested in religion, but she worked for a TV network in town and she had a boss. And one day,  she screwed up and if she could have easily lost her job, but the boss took the blame for her  fallout. He was able to keep his job with that kind of thing, but she probably would not have  been able to keep it. And she was amazed.

She said she had a number of bosses who would shift  the blame to her. But she'd never had a boss who took the blame from her. And she was just  astounded. And so she went and she thanked him, but then she kept pushing it. You know, why would  you do that?

And that was awfully nice. Why would you do that? He tried to put her off a little bit  and say, well, thank you. And no, no, it's just something anybody would do. And finally,  he says, all right, I'm a Christian.

And she said, what's that got to do with it? And she says,  well, you know, he says, well, you see in other religions, you know, God does this and that,  but in our religion, our God actually came and took the blame. My Savior took the blame for me  and therefore I can take the blame for other people. Now this was a paradigm bomb because in her mind,  religion made people blamers. That's the only kind of person she'd ever see that got religious  blamers.

You never thought of a religion that could turn you into a taker of blame. You never saw  that. And suddenly she says, maybe this religion is different. Maybe this person is different. She  says, where do you go to church?

And it was redeemer and she started coming. So she had a model and  it blew it up. Let me give you another example. Another kind of burning bush is not an  explicable person, but an inexplicable train of thought. Now what I mean by that is a lot of  secular people are starting to become spiritual searchers because they're starting to think out  the implications of what it means to be a secular person to believe that there's really no  eternity.

There's no supernatural. There's no heaven. Everything is just an accident. Everything is  just a matter. Everything is matter and motion.

Everything is chemistry and biology and physics. That's it. And a lot of people are beginning to say, wait a minute, wait a minute, Jack Miles  in his lead article in the 97 December New York Times magazine, whole issue on spiritual searching. That's the one. The title of it was, religion makes a comeback, belief to follow.

And you see, the title of that shows exactly what I said in the beginning. People are searching. But they're searching for belief. They're searching and they're hungry, but we're not really ready  to find yet. But this is what he says.

This is terrific. He says, can a postmodern path be open for  thinking people to religion that they can practice? If the answer is yes, he's careful. I suspect the  first step on the path will be the religious reflection on the secular loss of faith. The secular loss of faith.

Now listen to this. He says, a man or woman who turns to religion may not  do so to acknowledge the mystery of God or religion, but to acknowledge the mystery in response to  which their religion has come into being. Namely, the felt necessity, mysterious in itself,  to live a moral life even when the grounds of morality cannot be known. Now, I mean it's a little  hard. Unless you've read the whole paragraph in the column, here's what he's saying.

He says,  we are secular people, and therefore there shouldn't be such a thing as morality. There shouldn't,  there's no moral absolutes. I mean, it's all a matter of opinion. There's not such thing as  beauty. It's all a matter of chemistry.

There's no way to say that human beings are more valuable than  rocks or trees or salamanders because we're just accidents. But he says, if my worldview that this  life is all there is is true, then there can't be such a thing as human value. There can't be such a  thing as beauty. There can't be such a thing as real injustice, but there is. And I'm seeing that I  have to live a moral life even though my secular worldview gives me no basis for it.

Now, you see what's  going on? If you're willing to think, see, this guy is completely out of screw tapes control. This  guy is thinking this guy is not looking at the 73 bus. He's starting to think he says, wait a minute,  if secularism is true, then there can't be injustice. There can't be real love.

There can't be  beauty. People really aren't valuable, but they are. And that means that everything almost he's  looking at is becoming a burning bush. And he's going back and saying, if my premises lead me  to a conclusion I know is not true, then I have to go back and check the premises. Maybe there is a god.

You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger brother. In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who try to  earn his love by being good. In his book, The Prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known  story reveals the heart of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother  and the judgmental older brother, and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal,  extravagant grace. Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith,  The Prodigal God will help you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way. The Prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the  hope and joy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the world.

Thirdly, an inexplicable trouble. Now, what I mean by that, troubles are our burning bushes. Oh, my. And here's why. And this is  especially no offense is especially relevant for a crowd that's with so many young people in it  because you're especially in a place like New York.

And who comes to New York? Young people come to  New York. You're the people that work out. You're the people with good grades. You're the people  who have really got your ducks in a row.

You're the people who have come here and you say,  I'm going to work out and I'm going to work real hard. And I've got this plan. I've got that plan. And I can master life. You know, come on world.

I'm ready. And you've got a little paradigm. And the paradigm is if I really, really work hard. If I'm really wise, I'm really careful. If I'm really savvy, I will be able to handle life.

Life is manageable. Oh, no, it's not. And when some, you know, you see yourself as big and life is little and all of a sudden,  the troubles hit you. And you suddenly think, see yourself as some little teeny thing beside  the huge mountain of reality. And you begin to realize that the trouble is a burning bush  that is smashing your little model of reality, namely that you're competent to run your own life.

That you're wise enough and strong enough to be able to just handle normal life. Most of us think that way until a little, until a trouble comes. You can't do it by yourself. You can't be your own Savior. You can't be your own Lord.

Here's the last one. Burning bush can be an inexplicable person, can be an inexplicable  train of thought, can be an inexplicable trouble, but it also can be an inexplicable emptiness. Now, actually, if you were here last week, we talked about this. We had an open forum and we  talked about success. And I made a reference to one of my favorite quotes as a column by Cynthia  Heimel in the Village Voice some years ago in which she talked about the fact that she knew an  awful lot of people who had been not famous and they became famous.

She knew a lot of movie stars  before they became famous. And she found out after they became famous, they got to be extremely  angry, extremely upset, extremely manic, extremely depressed. And here's a part of her article I  didn't read last week. She says, I believe that when God wants to play a really rotten joke on you,  he grants you your deepest wish and then giggles mirrorly as you suddenly realize you want to kill  yourself. Now, you know why she says that?

She says that everybody she knows, who's ever gotten  their fondest dreams and there's not that many. People who've dreamt of fame, they get it, dreamt of  wealth, they get it, dreamt of some kind of success, they get it. She says, the few people she knows  go berserk because they think that that is what surely is going to fulfill the minute it didn't. That's surely what's going to make them feel good about themselves and it doesn't. That's  surely what's going to really make life great now and it hasn't.

And as a result, they suddenly  realize, oh my gosh, there is a vacuum in me huge and their paradigm and that is that this is  salvation. This is what life's about, completely is destroyed. Success and the emptiness that  always comes with success is the maybe the most powerful of all of the burning bushes. You see? But you have to have one or you'll never find God.

They've got to come in and notice they're almost  all in pleasant, unless your boss takes, you know, saves your job. That's the best kind. But  they tend to be very unpleasant. They tend to be foolish, stormy and strong. They really are  very, very hard.

And so listen, when they come, here's what I suggest. Those of you who are searching,  it could be that this has happened to you. It could be that you're in the very beginning. Something  like this has come into your life and you've turned aside. Good.

Would you please turn aside? What does it mean to turn aside? If what if Moses had looked at his watch and said, I got to get  the flock home by eight o'clock? You never would have heard of Moses. He never would have met God.

Why? Because he was in ordinary life. He was just in the stream. You have to turn aside. You have to spend  time.

You have to read. You have to think you have to become vulnerable to a degree because you've  got to talk to somebody about these things. And boy, who knows, you know, what that will lead to? You've got to turn aside. You've got to give it time.

You've got to. You've got to make room. Oh, do. Now, Christians, if you say, well, this isn't about me, is it? Of course it is.

And here's why. I know you're not going to want to hear this, but here's what here it is. The way to find more of God  is always happens on the same principles on the same principles on which you find God. In other words,  the same principles for finding more of God are the principles on which you find God, which means  if you're just sort of moving along in the ordinary stream of life as a Christian,  you're never going to get deeper unless something comes in and smashes the little paradigms. And the reason why we are not growing, the reason we are not more like Christ is not simply  that we need to try harder.

Always the reason why we're not more like Christ is because our understanding  of the gospel or understanding of Jesus or understanding of what the Bible teaches about God  is faulty. We read it. We think we understand it. Oh, in other words, the average Christian says,  Jesus is my meaning in life. I am a Christian.

I'm born again. I'm a Christian. Jesus is my meaning in  life. And then along comes some kind of career failure. And you're ready to slit your throat.

And what does that mean? You thought Jesus was your meaning in life. You thought Jesus was your  righteousness, that Jesus was your honor and your glory. You thought that you were saved by what Jesus  has done, not by what you're doing. And then along comes this little paradigm.

I'm in blows it up  and it's just not in the case at all. You thought you were depending on God and then come along,  along comes some kind of burning bush. Or you thought you understood God and then suddenly  something happens. You say, God should never let such a thing happen. Well, in your view of God  that could never, nothing like that should ever happen, but it happened.

It's happened there. It  is the burning bush. You see? And because it's there, that means your view of God is wrong. Don't  get mad at God.

Realize it's your view of God. It's your model of reality. There is no way to find  more of God without doing it the same way you found God to start with. Secondly, after he turns  aside and he comes on in, he realizes that God has something to say to him. Now a lot of people  turn aside and they start to come in, but they don't hear this.

And here's the best way to put  this. It's a little contradiction, a little contradiction that always gets you into a search mode. It's these contradictions of persons or troubles or intellectual trains of thought and so on,  but the way you know you're right at the threshold of actually finding God is when you come to see  the big contradiction. Little contradictions lead you to a big contradiction. And here's the big  contradiction.

Unless you've felt this, unless you've wrestled with this, unless this is born down on  you, you're not going to meet the real God. And the big contradiction is this. He speaks to Moses  and this is what he says. Moses, Moses, do not come any closer. Now that is an incredible contradiction.

Why? I'll tell you why. On the one hand and then on the other hand, first of all, Moses,  Moses. Now in English, this doesn't seem to work because we say Moses, Moses, okay, what does that  mean? In Hebrew, the doubling of a word means magnitude.

In the Old Testament, there's many places  where in your translations, you're reading the Old Testament in English and it'll say things like  great pits. They fell into the great pits. That's not like in Genesis 18 or something. They fell  into great pits. But if you're actually reading in Hebrew, it'll say the pit pits because in Hebrew,  the way to say big pits is to say pit pits, okay?

And when you double a proper name,  like when David doesn't just say Absalom, but it says Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son,  when Jesus says Simon, Simon, Satan wanted to have you and sift you like wheat when Jesus says Martha  The doubling of a name means emotional intensity, magnitude of relationship. Now it always means I want to have a relationship with you. It always means love. It always means  intensity. Now are you starting to figure this out?

When Moses walks up, God says I want you closer. Go away. Moses, Moses, don't come any closer. Now wait a minute. Do you see?

He's saying come closer. Stop. Take off your shoes. This is holy ground. What's going on here?

On the one hand, he's being told  I am a holy God. That's the reason why the God is a God of fire. Fire means holiness. Fire means  justice. Fire means majesty.

Fire means I am what I am. Not what you want me to be. When Moses said what is your name? God did not say my name is I am what you want. No.

What God said the Moses is I am what I am. You see, if his name was I am what I want,  it wouldn't have been a fiery, but it would have been clay. You can do what do you want with him? People are constantly doing this. They start right out saying this.

They say well I just am looking  for God. You got your faith and that's good for you and it helps you. That's fine for you. And it's true for you. But if I can find a faith, I need a faith.

It's true for me. And so when they  ask me, well I'm interested in being a Christian, you shall say now to Christians believe this,  I mean if I become a Christian, well I have to do this and this, I don't want to have to do this  and I don't have to do this. Now you know what's going on? That's a clay God. That's not a fiery God.

What you're looking for is a God that fits you instead of a God that you fit. You see in clay,  it's molded by the toucher, but fire melts the touchy. I mean the toucher comes in and touches clay  and of course the clay gives to the toucher. But fire, if you touch the fire, turns you to clay. And what God is saying right off the bat is, if you want the real God, you've got to look for a God  that can contradict you.

If you want the real God, you've got to look for a God. You have to be  willing to see a God who's going to tell you things you don't want to hear. When somebody says,  let me go right out. When somebody says, you know, I've got a girlfriend, I've got a boyfriend. I don't want to be a Christian if it means getting in the way of that.

Now here's what you're saying. It's an utter contradiction. You're in the stream of life, so you're not being logical. So let me get you out. What you're saying is, I know who I am before I even know who he is.

I haven't even met God, but I know what I need. I haven't met God, but I know what sex ethics are. I haven't even met God, but I know what my needs are. How could you know who you are before you  even met him if he's the creator? If there is a creator, if he's done all this, which means you  can't even begin to search for this God, a real God without taking your shoes off.

You see, God doesn't say, I want to meet you, and then you can take your shoes off. He says,  you're not even going to meet me until you take your shoes off first. And what that means,  you have got to say, God, if you're there, I am willing to do things that right now I don't like. And if you're not willing to say that, and most most modern people are not,  then what you've actually done is you're saying, I'm looking for God, but you're not looking for God,  you're not looking for a real God, reality is not what you want it to be. Don't you know that by now?

Reality is always itself. You can't really change. I mean, you're, you know, all right, guy,  you're 125 pounds, and you're five foot six, and you're working out, you're never going to play  professional football. I don't care. Never.

You can do everything you want. You're just not going  to be able to do it. You probably won't even be able to be a kicker. But certainly not going to be  the lineback you've always dreamt to be. Reality is there.

And if there is, I mean, if somebody comes  to you and says, I want to get to know you, you say, fine. So well, I like to think of you as a  demanding, domineering person. You say, how dare you? You don't even really want to know who I am. You've, you can't get to know me by just saying, I want to think, but now look what you've done.

When a person says, I don't want to find a God who won't let me do this or that. I don't want  to be narrow person. And what you're really saying is, I refuse to give to God the same deference I  demand from anybody else who wants to get to know me. See, unless you take your shoes off  from the beginning, that means unless you're willing to find a God who tells you things you don't  want to hear and demands things that you don't want to do, you haven't even begun to search. You  can't start the search objectively.

And then hope that somehow we'll find a God. You've got to  start up by saying, God, if you're there, I'm willing to agree that you may be holy. You may be  fire. Now I said that and you say, wait a minute, if that's the case, oh my goodness,  oh my goodness, oh my goodness, I don't want to God like that. But now the same God who says,  stay back.

I'm holy. Don't just walk into me. Don't just be casual with the spirit of curiosity. You see, show some deference, show some respect. Be willing to surrender to even find me.

But then he's also the guy who says, Moses, Moses, you know, or your name here, whatever your name  is. He says, I want you in. I want to be part of you. I want to come close. In fact, the very  statement, Moses, Moses, stay away is a burning bush.

It's an utter contradiction. What God is saying is, I want to have my holiness in you. But how can God's holiness come in me? How can this great and majestic thing come down into me? You see what God is,  you see what the burning bush is?

The burning bush is the contradiction at the heart of  biblical religion. And that is the true God insists that he is not really holy and maybe a  little loving or not really loving and maybe a little holy, but he's absolutely holy and he's  absolutely loving. He is a burning bush. He is another contradiction. And everybody else in the  world refuses to listen to who he is.

Religious people say he's really holy and we can get to  heaven by trying our best and doing good. In other words, you know, they emphasize the holiness  and not the grace. And that's the reason why we don't like them. And that's the reason why  basically they don't have a God that they really enjoy, but a God of drudgery. And they don't even have  a God they can really get passionate for because they have a God that you can control.

You have a  tame God. If you think you can earn your way to heaven, that's not a fiery God. That's a very tame  God. You bought him off. But on the other hand, the other people don't look at the holiness.

They look at the love. Modern people love the idea of a God who just accepts us, you know,  Mr. Rogers God, right? I love you just the way you are. And I just love and accept you.

And that  also is not a fiery God. That is a sentimental God. And you're not going to get you don't get passionate  about that. A person who says God is holy and he occasionally forgives. You're not filled with joy  to God like that.

Or God says, yes, he accepts me just the way I am. And there's no cost in  of his love. And you're not accept. There is no fire unless he's both equally. Do you see the  contradiction?

If you insist on going truth or love and not keeping them together, if you insist  on saying, I believe in a God who's really basically demanding God, or I believe in a God who's  a completely loving, accepting God of everybody, if you go either way, you'll never see the true God  because the true God is a fiery God who says, I want a relationship of love with you. This is the reason why Jesus says we pipe the flute for you and you would not dance and we  sang a dirge for you and you would not mourn. Christianity is far more optimistic and pessimistic. Far higher and lower. God says, I am the holy God, but I come down, see, verse 8, in mercy.

Christianity is far more demanding in what God does than any other religion and far more loving  and far more gracious in what God does than any other religion. No other religion has a God  that holy who says, be perfect or you won't get the heaven. God says that in the Bible. No other  religion says that, but on the other hand, no other religion has a God who comes down. And that's  the solution.

The little contradictions will bring you to God. The big contradiction will be in  front of you. Don't leave that. Don't ever compromise. Don't ever move away from what it says.

But what's the solution? How can that holiness come into my life? And the answer is, in the midst of  the burning bush, there's an angel. Not an angel. I'm sorry, did I say an angel?

Very important in  the Old Testament. Whenever you reach, whenever you see an angel and anybody tries to worship an angel,  the angel always says, get up. I'm a creature just like yourself. But in the Old Testament,  there's a very mysterious figure who's called the angel of the Lord. Verse 2,  there the angel of the Lord appeared to him and flames the fire.

Now, how is it possible  that this contradiction can be brought together? And the answer is, the Lord spoke through the angel. There was a mediator in the bush. The angel was in the bush and yet the Lord spoke through  the bush. What?

Through the mediator. There was this figure, this mysterious figure. But this mediator was in the midst of the fire. Why? We know the answer.

All through the Old Testament, God says, the way you can live with a holy God and have a personal  relationship with me is if someone substitutes and takes your punishment. And so over and over and  over again, sacrifices were made into the fire of God's holiness. When you were guilty, you made  a sacrifice and you asked for forgiveness. And it was a substitute. Something was slain and put  into the fire.

But the New Testament tells us why. Because there was one who went in and by one  sacrifice through himself into the fire, he was consumed so that we will not have to be consumed. And because Jesus Christ was consumed by the holy wrath of God, we are able to become  burning bushes ourselves. Do you know what a burning bush is? A burning bush is someone with  the holiness of God in us, but it doesn't destroy us.

You know what that means? A Christian is  someone filled with power, personality, and dwelling personality. Secondly, a Christian is someone  with beauty. In fact, there is no better picture of what Martin Luther called the card of the gospel,  symbol used to set peccator. Simultaneously, when you become a Christian, because Jesus Christ  is not for you, you are simultaneously just and sinful.

Simultaneously, you're beautiful but a bush. You know, not a giant redwood sequoia. You know, when you become a Christian, you don't become a  sequoia. You become a burning bush. You're still a bush.

You're still a sinner. And yet,  you're clothed with the righteousness of Jesus. You're filled with the beauty of Jesus. You know, that is what's possible. And it will only be possible.

And you will only turn into a  passionate, burning heart person. If you see not just the God of truth, or just the God of love,  but to see the law by Christful filled, and here is pardoning voice, transforms a slave into a  child and duty into choice. Do you understand? Let the little contradictions drive you to the big  contradiction. And then stay with that.

If this is the first time you've heard of it tonight,  I can tell you this. You probably don't get it yet. I wasn't that clear. There wasn't enough time,  but I tell you please turn aside. And Christian friends, realize this.

If you need to get your  bush burning again, go back and see what Jesus did. Go back and see him consumed in the fire. Go  back and see that because he was burned and consumed, we can burn and not be consumed  with the holy power of God. To the degree you see that. You see, to the degree you see him  burning in the bush, you'll become a bush that burns and is not consumed.

Let's pray. We ask Father that you'd help us to apply these things. A lot of us are actually suffering right  now and we're just grumpy about it. We're just mad about it. Instead of seeing that this is your  way of turning us aside with contradictions and bringing us into the heart of the great contradiction,  which is that the law was fulfilled by your love in Jesus Christ.

We ask that you would change  your hearts with these things and apply them to our lives through Jesus and his name we pray. Amen.

### 引言：寻找上帝

你是否曾问过自己，如果我所做的一切都没有持久的意义，那又如何？这就是全部吗？在今天的播客中，Tim Keller 探讨了传道书如何帮助我们面对疑虑、恐惧和不确定性，并指引我们在基督里找到持久的希望和意义。

> "你可以和我一起阅读。我将阅读出埃及记第一章，你有第1到11节。我将一直读到第14节。所以当你到达页面底部时，只需再等八秒钟就结束了。"

出埃及记第3章第1到14节。摩西牧养他岳父米甸祭司叶忒罗的羊群。他领羊群到旷野的尽头，来到神的山，就是何烈山。耶和华的使者从荆棘中火焰里向他显现。摩西见荆棘被火烧着，却没有烧毁。摩西说，我要过去看这大异象，这荆棘为何没有烧毁。

**耶和华见他过去要看，就从荆棘中呼叫说，摩西，摩西。他说，我在这里。**

### 燃烧的荆棘：范式炸弹

当摩西看到燃烧的荆棘时，这是一个扰乱事件。它将他从正常的行动轨道中带出。**燃烧的荆棘是与你的现实观念相矛盾的事物。**

- 燃烧的荆棘实际上是一个范式炸弹。
- 它进入你对事物应有样子的范式并将其炸毁。

### 不可解释的：转向

燃烧的荆棘可以以多种形式出现：

- 不可解释的人
- 不可解释的思路
- 不可解释的麻烦
- 不可解释的空虚

**你必须转向。你必须花时间。你必须阅读。你必须思考，你必须在某种程度上变得脆弱，因为你必须与某人谈论这些事情。**

### 大矛盾：圣洁与爱

上帝对摩西说：“摩西，摩西，不要再靠近。”这是一个令人难以置信的矛盾。

- **一方面，上帝是圣洁和公义的。另一方面，他是慈爱的，并希望与我们建立关系。**
- 上帝是燃烧的荆棘，是圣经宗教核心的矛盾。

### 中保：主的使者

在燃烧的荆棘中，有一个天使。**天使在荆棘中，但耶和华通过荆棘说话。**

- 荆棘中有一个中保。
- 耶稣基督被上帝的圣洁愤怒所消耗，因此我们能够成为燃烧的荆棘。

**在你看到他在荆棘中燃烧的程度上，你将成为一个燃烧而不被消耗的荆棘。**

让我们祷告。我们请求父亲帮助我们应用这些事情。我们中的许多人现在实际上正在受苦，我们对此感到不满。我们只是对此感到愤怒。相反，我们应该看到这是你通过矛盾转向我们的方式，并将我们带入伟大矛盾的核心，即律法在耶稣基督的爱中得以实现。我们请求你用这些事情改变我们的心，并通过耶稣和他的名应用到我们的生活中。阿门。
