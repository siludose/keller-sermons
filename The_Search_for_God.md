## English Transcript / 英文原文

today's podcast, Tim Keller looks at how Ecclesiastes helps us  face our doubts, fears, and uncertainties, and points us to the lasting hope and significance  we have in Christ. You can read from that with me. I'm going to read in Exodus chapter 1, you have verses 1 to 11. I'm going to read all the way down to 14. So when you get to the bottom of the page, just  wait another eight seconds and it'll be over.

Exodus chapter 3 verses 1 to 14. Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law,  the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the desert and came to Horeb,  the mountain of God. There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire from within a  bush. Moses saw that through the bush, that though the bush was on fire, it did not burn up. So Moses thought, I will go over and see this strange sight, why the bush does not burn up.

When the Lord saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush,  Moses, Moses. And Moses said, here I am. What else do you say? Anyway, I've always wondered,  do not come any closer, God said, take off your sandals for the place where you were standing as  holy ground. Then he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,  and the God of Jacob.

At this, Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at God. The Lord said, I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I've heard them crying out  because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering. So I have come down  to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good  and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey, the home of the Canaanites, Hidites,  Amrites, Parasites, Hivites, and Jebiusites. And now the cry of the Israelites has reached  me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them.

So now go, I am sending you to  Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt. But Moses said to God, who am I,  that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt? And God said, I will be with you,  and this will be the sign to you, that it is I who have sent you. When you have brought the people  out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain. And Moses said to God, suppose I go to the Israelites  and say to them, look, God of your fathers has sent me to you, and they ask me, what is his name?

What shall I tell them? God said, I am who I am. This is what you were to say to the Israelites. I am, has sent me to you. This is God's word.

In the beginning here of the fall, we've been  giving some concepts and some guidelines for people who are searching spiritually,  and it's really, well, not everywhere, but it's certainly a plain fact that it's actually  acceptable, even in a secular urban place like New York City. It's now acceptable to say,  I am a spiritual searcher. I am spiritually searching. If you go to Barnes and Noble and you look  at all the new nonfiction books, which I did recently, there was something like 25% of the first  shelf that I saw that had something to do with God, something to do with spirituality, something to  do with soul, something to do. Here are some of the titles.

Here are two of my favorite titles. One  is called Cyber Grace, searching for God in a digital age, searching for God. Okay, here's another one,  not as funny, but same thing. Besides still waters, and the subtitle was searching for meaning in  an age of doubt. Now, as I read these, or surveyed them, of course in Barnes and Noble, you know,  you can sit down and just read them and just stay there.

But as I was surveying and reading them,  I noticed something, and I noticed that the writers of these books are tremendously conflicted,  that's the right word. And here's where the conflict is. Though 10 years ago, even certainly 20 years  ago, if you are a modern, sophisticated, secular, urban type person here in New York, it would not  have been acceptable. It would not have been respectable to say, I'm a spiritual searcher. Today,  it is very respectable.

It's very almost noble. It's insightful. It's wise to say, I'm a spiritual  searcher, but I've noticed when I read the book, that it is not acceptable. It's acceptable to say,  I'm searching, but it's not acceptable to say, I've found anything. It's one thing to say, I'm  searching for God.

None of these books would be up on the shelf if they said, finding God in an  age of doubt, finding God in a digital age. That's what they're not talking about that. And what's  intriguing is, they're all in this kind of bind. It is a bind. They are searching with a tremendous  sphere of finding.

Not a terrible situation to be in. It would think it has to be far more comfortable  to either search, either not search or define, but not to search, not wanting to find. And the reason  for this, I've been thinking about this, I'm looking at this thing and I'm seeing what they say,  and they feel they say, well, I'm a spiritual searcher, but I'm not one of those people that say,  I've found God. I'm not one of those people that believe you can have certainty anymore. Now, here's my belief on that.

Here's my understanding for what I can tell, and sometimes it comes  right out in the books. Most spiritual searchers have been involved in religious institutions. They  were many of them were raised in churches or synagogues or something else. They have some kind of  religious background. And they found that inside religious institutions, religious people  are more angry, more insecure, more judgmental, more hypocritical.

There's more fighting. There's  more pride and prejudice going on inside religious institutions than outside. And religious people say,  I found God. And we don't want to be like them. Now, I want to put it on the record right here  that I agree that by and large, inside religious organizations, religious societies and religious  bodies, there is more insecurity, anger.

There is more fighting. There is more brutality. There  is more abuse. There is more hypocrisy than outside. I will just come out and say, yes.

And therefore,  it's perfectly understandable why people say, I'm searching. See, there's stuck between the smugness  of the religious people they don't want. And their own deep spiritual emptiness. They're stuck. Is there a way out?

Yeah, I think there's a way out. The way out is this. First of all, you have to  recognize a fallacy. And the fallacy is this. Let me put to you this way.

Imagine John Doe. He's  always getting drunk. Why? Well, on Monday night, he got drunk on gin and soda water. On Tuesday night,  he got drunk on vodka and soda water.

On Wednesday night, he got drunk on bourbon and soda water. What is it that's making him drunk? Obviously, the common factor, soda water. That must be what's  making him drunk. Right?

No. Of course not. And yet, here's a narrow person and they think they found  God. Here's a narrow person. They think they found God.

Here's a narrow person. Association is not causation. And for a person who's very narrow and condemning to say,  I found God, doesn't mean at all that the judgmental attitude is caused by the conviction of finding  God. And yet, that's the assumption. It could be that you see there's something else causing it.

There's something else besides religious certainty that they found God. There might be some other  cause. And if that's true, and you get over that fallacy, you can finally go to the book,  which is five far, the most likely book, to tell you something about God. And that's the Bible. In fact, if you go to the Old Testament where you have Judaism and Islam and Christianity,  you put those three together and you have three quarters of the human race or something like that  in terms of the people's tradition.

If you take a look at all that,  you see, they all take a look at the Old Testament and they all say, this is sacred. The only intelligent way to find out how do I find God is to go to the Bible first at least. And when you go to the Bible, you'll see the Bible says you can find God,  not just search for God, but find God. And this particular passage that I read where Moses finds  God is really very, very important because it really gives you all the basic principles. There's three things that we see here, not exactly three things.

There's actually the same thing  looked at more and more deeply. There's burning bush. At first, it's a distracting,  disrupting site. At first, all it is to Moses is a disrupting site. When it gets closer, he sees  it's an unmanageable power.

And when it gets even closer, he sees there's a burning angel in the  middle. And I would like to say to you, as you see each of these three, you are going to pass  through the stages through which you have to go to find God. You have to see the same three  things. You have to know and experience the same three things. What are they?

I'll summarize  at the end. Phenomenally, that means when I'm looking at it from the outside, first of all,  we look at it and it's just a disrupting site. It takes him out of his normal course of action. Then he goes in closer and he sees it's an unmanageable power. And then last of all, he sees  there's a burning angel in the middle of it.

Until you see all three things, until the same  three things happen to you, you can't find God. Now, let's take a look at the three things. Each one  is a stage. First, first of all, the burning bush is a disrupting event. Now, what I mean by  disrupting, notice it says here in verse three and four, says Moses saw that though the bush was  on fire, it did not burn up.

So he said, I will go over and see it. And verse four says the Lord saw  that he had gone over to look. And then he spoke. Now, the word gone over is not a very good translation. This is one of the places where our translation, I think, fails us.

Because we have a very specific  word here that's used twice. And the much better translation would be turn aside. It's a word  that's used in Hebrew to mean go off the beaten path, go off the normal path, go off the main road. Moses was just, what was he doing? He was just moving his flock around.

He was doing his thing. He  was an ordinary life. And unless something came to disrupt ordinary life, he would never have  started to search for God. You know, Moses doesn't say, I think I'll search for God today. Something  has to disrupt him and turn him aside from the normal path because the Bible tells us, ordinary life  makes you too busy and this inclines you to search for God.

What do I mean? Well, you know,  see us Lewis in his book on the screw tape letters. It's a lot of fun. It's a fun thing to read if  you've never read it. It's a quick read.

And it's a fiction book, I hope. And it's about a senior  devil writing letters to his nephew, a junior devil, who's still out on the tempting field. A  senior devil's name, screw tape. Screw tape is a retirement, sort of at least he's up higher in  the bureaucracy now of hell. And, you know, he's giving advice to his nephew.

And he starts to tell  his nephew one of the best ways to make sure that your patient, he calls him, never falls into  the clutches of the enemy, which of course is Jesus. And here's what he says, he says, the trouble  about argument is that it moves the whole struggle onto the enemy's ground. By the very act of  arguing, you awake the patient's reason. And once it's awake, who can foresee the result? Even if a particular strain of thought can be twisted to end in our favor, you will find that  you have been strengthening in your patient the fatal habit of attending to universal issues.

And with drawing attention from the stream of immediate sense experiences, your business  is to fix his attention on that stream. Teach him to call it real life. And don't let him ask what  he means by real. Remember, he's not like you. He's not a pure spirit.

You don't realize how  enslaved these humans are to the pressure of the ordinary. I once had a patient, a sound atheist  who used to read in the British Museum one day, as he sat reading, I saw a train of thought in his  mind beginning to go the wrong way. The enemy, of course, was at his elbow. Before I knew where I was,  I saw my 20 years of great, hard work beginning to totter. If I had lost my head and begun to attempt  a defense by argument, I should have been undone.

But I was not such a fool. I immediately suggested  it was just about time he has some lunch. The enemy presumably made the counter suggestion,  you know how one can never quite over hear what he says to them, that this was more important than  lunch. At least I think that must have been his line for when I said quite. In fact, it's much  too important to tackle at the end of the morning.

The patient brightened up considerably and by the  time I had added much better, come back after lunch and go into it with a fresh mind, he was already  halfway to the door. Once he was in the street, the battle was won. I showed him a newsboy shouting  the midday paper. I showed him a number 73 bus going past as usual. And before he reached the  bottom of the steps, I had gotten into him the unalterable conviction that whatever odd ideas may come  up into a man's head when he's a shut up alone with his books.

A healthy dose of real life by which  he meant the bus and the newsboy I imagine was enough to show him that all that sort of thing just  couldn't be true. He knew he'd had a narrow escape and in later years was fond of talking about  that inarticulate sense of actuality which is our ultimate safeguard against the aberrations of  mirror logic. He is now safe in our father's house below. We're never going to search for God as long  as we're in ordinary life. We're just busy.

We're just carried along. Sense experience keeps us from  asking the question, why am I so busy? What am I doing? What is it accomplishing? What's the  purpose of it all?

What is my life accomplishing? What is it all amounting to? We never asked  that question. We're too busy in ordinary life. Something has to turn us aside.

We'll never do  it on our own. Something has to come and turn us aside or we're stuck. And what is that thing that  has to turn us aside? It's got to be a burning bush. He turned aside and to see the strange sight.

Now, what is a burning bush? The burning bush is something that contradicts the model or view of  reality that you've got. A burning bush is something that is actually a paradigm bomb. It comes inside  your paradigm of what things should be like and it explodes it. Now I'll tell you how a burning  bush works.

The burning bush works like this. If such and such is true, which I think it is,  then such things couldn't happen. But there's one of those things. Therefore such and such can't be true. Got that?

See, I believe such and such. And if such and such, then this can't be, this can never  happen. But this just happened. Therefore such and such can't be true. That's a burning bush.

See,  in this case, if you're empiricist, if you're somebody who says, well, I just believe in what's  here and now, I believe that everything is a natural cause. I don't believe in the supernatural. I  don't believe in mystical things. I just believe everything is a natural cause. Oh, what's a burning  bush?

It's a contradiction. Because a bush is either burning and it's disintegrating  or it's cold and it's intact, but this is a bush that burns and is not consumed. And that means  that there's something more to life and reality. If you don't have a supernatural  view of reality, the burning bush is a paradigm bomb. If this world is all there is, then burning  bushes can't happen.

A burning bush has happened. Therefore, there must be something more to my  view. But my review of reality has to change. Now, a burning bush is the only thing that ever gets  us out of ordinary life and makes us turn aside and think about it and concentrate on it and ask  the big questions. See, now what form is going to burning bush come in?

Oh, my many, many forms,  many forms. Let me give you four quick ones, but they're very important. I mean, this is one of  the main things that this tells us. You'll never find God just by abstractly one day saying,  I think it's about time I'm 35. I should go find God.

That'll never happen. You're stuck  in the stream of ordinary life. Something's got to turn you aside and these are the things that  turn you aside. Let me give you a quick example. Four, one is an inexplicable person can be a burning  bush.

One of my favorite illustrations on this is a woman who this actually is in a book somewhere  I have to go find it, but there's a woman who told how she'd come to Redeemer back in the early days  when Redeemer was rather small. She was someone who never thought much about religion was an  interested in religion, but she worked for a TV network in town and she had a boss. And one day,  she screwed up and if she could have easily lost her job, but the boss took the blame for her  fallout. He was able to keep his job with that kind of thing, but she probably would not have  been able to keep it. And she was amazed.

She said she had a number of bosses who would shift  the blame to her. But she'd never had a boss who took the blame from her. And she was just  astounded. And so she went and she thanked him, but then she kept pushing it. You know, why would  you do that?

And that was awfully nice. Why would you do that? He tried to put her off a little bit  and say, well, thank you. And no, no, it's just something anybody would do. And finally,  he says, all right, I'm a Christian.

And she said, what's that got to do with it? And she says,  well, you know, he says, well, you see in other religions, you know, God does this and that,  but in our religion, our God actually came and took the blame. My Savior took the blame for me  and therefore I can take the blame for other people. Now this was a paradigm bomb because in her mind,  religion made people blamers. That's the only kind of person she'd ever see that got religious  blamers.

You never thought of a religion that could turn you into a taker of blame. You never saw  that. And suddenly she says, maybe this religion is different. Maybe this person is different. She  says, where do you go to church?

And it was redeemer and she started coming. So she had a model and  it blew it up. Let me give you another example. Another kind of burning bush is not an  explicable person, but an inexplicable train of thought. Now what I mean by that is a lot of  secular people are starting to become spiritual searchers because they're starting to think out  the implications of what it means to be a secular person to believe that there's really no  eternity.

There's no supernatural. There's no heaven. Everything is just an accident. Everything is  just a matter. Everything is matter and motion.

Everything is chemistry and biology and physics. That's it. And a lot of people are beginning to say, wait a minute, wait a minute, Jack Miles  in his lead article in the 97 December New York Times magazine, whole issue on spiritual searching. That's the one. The title of it was, religion makes a comeback, belief to follow.

And you see, the title of that shows exactly what I said in the beginning. People are searching. But they're searching for belief. They're searching and they're hungry, but we're not really ready  to find yet. But this is what he says.

This is terrific. He says, can a postmodern path be open for  thinking people to religion that they can practice? If the answer is yes, he's careful. I suspect the  first step on the path will be the religious reflection on the secular loss of faith. The secular loss of faith.

Now listen to this. He says, a man or woman who turns to religion may not  do so to acknowledge the mystery of God or religion, but to acknowledge the mystery in response to  which their religion has come into being. Namely, the felt necessity, mysterious in itself,  to live a moral life even when the grounds of morality cannot be known. Now, I mean it's a little  hard. Unless you've read the whole paragraph in the column, here's what he's saying.

He says,  we are secular people, and therefore there shouldn't be such a thing as morality. There shouldn't,  there's no moral absolutes. I mean, it's all a matter of opinion. There's not such thing as  beauty. It's all a matter of chemistry.

There's no way to say that human beings are more valuable than  rocks or trees or salamanders because we're just accidents. But he says, if my worldview that this  life is all there is is true, then there can't be such a thing as human value. There can't be such a  thing as beauty. There can't be such a thing as real injustice, but there is. And I'm seeing that I  have to live a moral life even though my secular worldview gives me no basis for it.

Now, you see what's  going on? If you're willing to think, see, this guy is completely out of screw tapes control. This  guy is thinking this guy is not looking at the 73 bus. He's starting to think he says, wait a minute,  if secularism is true, then there can't be injustice. There can't be real love.

There can't be  beauty. People really aren't valuable, but they are. And that means that everything almost he's  looking at is becoming a burning bush. And he's going back and saying, if my premises lead me  to a conclusion I know is not true, then I have to go back and check the premises. Maybe there is a god.

You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger brother. In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who try to  earn his love by being good. In his book, The Prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known  story reveals the heart of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother  and the judgmental older brother, and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal,  extravagant grace. Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith,  The Prodigal God will help you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way. The Prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the  hope and joy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the world.

Thirdly, an inexplicable trouble. Now, what I mean by that, troubles are our burning bushes. Oh, my. And here's why. And this is  especially no offense is especially relevant for a crowd that's with so many young people in it  because you're especially in a place like New York.

And who comes to New York? Young people come to  New York. You're the people that work out. You're the people with good grades. You're the people  who have really got your ducks in a row.

You're the people who have come here and you say,  I'm going to work out and I'm going to work real hard. And I've got this plan. I've got that plan. And I can master life. You know, come on world.

I'm ready. And you've got a little paradigm. And the paradigm is if I really, really work hard. If I'm really wise, I'm really careful. If I'm really savvy, I will be able to handle life.

Life is manageable. Oh, no, it's not. And when some, you know, you see yourself as big and life is little and all of a sudden,  the troubles hit you. And you suddenly think, see yourself as some little teeny thing beside  the huge mountain of reality. And you begin to realize that the trouble is a burning bush  that is smashing your little model of reality, namely that you're competent to run your own life.

That you're wise enough and strong enough to be able to just handle normal life. Most of us think that way until a little, until a trouble comes. You can't do it by yourself. You can't be your own Savior. You can't be your own Lord.

Here's the last one. Burning bush can be an inexplicable person, can be an inexplicable  train of thought, can be an inexplicable trouble, but it also can be an inexplicable emptiness. Now, actually, if you were here last week, we talked about this. We had an open forum and we  talked about success. And I made a reference to one of my favorite quotes as a column by Cynthia  Heimel in the Village Voice some years ago in which she talked about the fact that she knew an  awful lot of people who had been not famous and they became famous.

She knew a lot of movie stars  before they became famous. And she found out after they became famous, they got to be extremely  angry, extremely upset, extremely manic, extremely depressed. And here's a part of her article I  didn't read last week. She says, I believe that when God wants to play a really rotten joke on you,  he grants you your deepest wish and then giggles mirrorly as you suddenly realize you want to kill  yourself. Now, you know why she says that?

She says that everybody she knows, who's ever gotten  their fondest dreams and there's not that many. People who've dreamt of fame, they get it, dreamt of  wealth, they get it, dreamt of some kind of success, they get it. She says, the few people she knows  go berserk because they think that that is what surely is going to fulfill the minute it didn't. That's surely what's going to make them feel good about themselves and it doesn't. That's  surely what's going to really make life great now and it hasn't.

And as a result, they suddenly  realize, oh my gosh, there is a vacuum in me huge and their paradigm and that is that this is  salvation. This is what life's about, completely is destroyed. Success and the emptiness that  always comes with success is the maybe the most powerful of all of the burning bushes. You see? But you have to have one or you'll never find God.

They've got to come in and notice they're almost  all in pleasant, unless your boss takes, you know, saves your job. That's the best kind. But  they tend to be very unpleasant. They tend to be foolish, stormy and strong. They really are  very, very hard.

And so listen, when they come, here's what I suggest. Those of you who are searching,  it could be that this has happened to you. It could be that you're in the very beginning. Something  like this has come into your life and you've turned aside. Good.

Would you please turn aside? What does it mean to turn aside? If what if Moses had looked at his watch and said, I got to get  the flock home by eight o'clock? You never would have heard of Moses. He never would have met God.

Why? Because he was in ordinary life. He was just in the stream. You have to turn aside. You have to spend  time.

You have to read. You have to think you have to become vulnerable to a degree because you've  got to talk to somebody about these things. And boy, who knows, you know, what that will lead to? You've got to turn aside. You've got to give it time.

You've got to. You've got to make room. Oh, do. Now, Christians, if you say, well, this isn't about me, is it? Of course it is.

And here's why. I know you're not going to want to hear this, but here's what here it is. The way to find more of God  is always happens on the same principles on the same principles on which you find God. In other words,  the same principles for finding more of God are the principles on which you find God, which means  if you're just sort of moving along in the ordinary stream of life as a Christian,  you're never going to get deeper unless something comes in and smashes the little paradigms. And the reason why we are not growing, the reason we are not more like Christ is not simply  that we need to try harder.

Always the reason why we're not more like Christ is because our understanding  of the gospel or understanding of Jesus or understanding of what the Bible teaches about God  is faulty. We read it. We think we understand it. Oh, in other words, the average Christian says,  Jesus is my meaning in life. I am a Christian.

I'm born again. I'm a Christian. Jesus is my meaning in  life. And then along comes some kind of career failure. And you're ready to slit your throat.

And what does that mean? You thought Jesus was your meaning in life. You thought Jesus was your  righteousness, that Jesus was your honor and your glory. You thought that you were saved by what Jesus  has done, not by what you're doing. And then along comes this little paradigm.

I'm in blows it up  and it's just not in the case at all. You thought you were depending on God and then come along,  along comes some kind of burning bush. Or you thought you understood God and then suddenly  something happens. You say, God should never let such a thing happen. Well, in your view of God  that could never, nothing like that should ever happen, but it happened.

It's happened there. It  is the burning bush. You see? And because it's there, that means your view of God is wrong. Don't  get mad at God.

Realize it's your view of God. It's your model of reality. There is no way to find  more of God without doing it the same way you found God to start with. Secondly, after he turns  aside and he comes on in, he realizes that God has something to say to him. Now a lot of people  turn aside and they start to come in, but they don't hear this.

And here's the best way to put  this. It's a little contradiction, a little contradiction that always gets you into a search mode. It's these contradictions of persons or troubles or intellectual trains of thought and so on,  but the way you know you're right at the threshold of actually finding God is when you come to see  the big contradiction. Little contradictions lead you to a big contradiction. And here's the big  contradiction.

Unless you've felt this, unless you've wrestled with this, unless this is born down on  you, you're not going to meet the real God. And the big contradiction is this. He speaks to Moses  and this is what he says. Moses, Moses, do not come any closer. Now that is an incredible contradiction.

Why? I'll tell you why. On the one hand and then on the other hand, first of all, Moses,  Moses. Now in English, this doesn't seem to work because we say Moses, Moses, okay, what does that  mean? In Hebrew, the doubling of a word means magnitude.

In the Old Testament, there's many places  where in your translations, you're reading the Old Testament in English and it'll say things like  great pits. They fell into the great pits. That's not like in Genesis 18 or something. They fell  into great pits. But if you're actually reading in Hebrew, it'll say the pit pits because in Hebrew,  the way to say big pits is to say pit pits, okay?

And when you double a proper name,  like when David doesn't just say Absalom, but it says Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son,  when Jesus says Simon, Simon, Satan wanted to have you and sift you like wheat when Jesus says Martha  The doubling of a name means emotional intensity, magnitude of relationship. Now it always means I want to have a relationship with you. It always means love. It always means  intensity. Now are you starting to figure this out?

When Moses walks up, God says I want you closer. Go away. Moses, Moses, don't come any closer. Now wait a minute. Do you see?

He's saying come closer. Stop. Take off your shoes. This is holy ground. What's going on here?

On the one hand, he's being told  I am a holy God. That's the reason why the God is a God of fire. Fire means holiness. Fire means  justice. Fire means majesty.

Fire means I am what I am. Not what you want me to be. When Moses said what is your name? God did not say my name is I am what you want. No.

What God said the Moses is I am what I am. You see, if his name was I am what I want,  it wouldn't have been a fiery, but it would have been clay. You can do what do you want with him? People are constantly doing this. They start right out saying this.

They say well I just am looking  for God. You got your faith and that's good for you and it helps you. That's fine for you. And it's true for you. But if I can find a faith, I need a faith.

It's true for me. And so when they  ask me, well I'm interested in being a Christian, you shall say now to Christians believe this,  I mean if I become a Christian, well I have to do this and this, I don't want to have to do this  and I don't have to do this. Now you know what's going on? That's a clay God. That's not a fiery God.

What you're looking for is a God that fits you instead of a God that you fit. You see in clay,  it's molded by the toucher, but fire melts the touchy. I mean the toucher comes in and touches clay  and of course the clay gives to the toucher. But fire, if you touch the fire, turns you to clay. And what God is saying right off the bat is, if you want the real God, you've got to look for a God  that can contradict you.

If you want the real God, you've got to look for a God. You have to be  willing to see a God who's going to tell you things you don't want to hear. When somebody says,  let me go right out. When somebody says, you know, I've got a girlfriend, I've got a boyfriend. I don't want to be a Christian if it means getting in the way of that.

Now here's what you're saying. It's an utter contradiction. You're in the stream of life, so you're not being logical. So let me get you out. What you're saying is, I know who I am before I even know who he is.

I haven't even met God, but I know what I need. I haven't met God, but I know what sex ethics are. I haven't even met God, but I know what my needs are. How could you know who you are before you  even met him if he's the creator? If there is a creator, if he's done all this, which means you  can't even begin to search for this God, a real God without taking your shoes off.

You see, God doesn't say, I want to meet you, and then you can take your shoes off. He says,  you're not even going to meet me until you take your shoes off first. And what that means,  you have got to say, God, if you're there, I am willing to do things that right now I don't like. And if you're not willing to say that, and most most modern people are not,  then what you've actually done is you're saying, I'm looking for God, but you're not looking for God,  you're not looking for a real God, reality is not what you want it to be. Don't you know that by now?

Reality is always itself. You can't really change. I mean, you're, you know, all right, guy,  you're 125 pounds, and you're five foot six, and you're working out, you're never going to play  professional football. I don't care. Never.

You can do everything you want. You're just not going  to be able to do it. You probably won't even be able to be a kicker. But certainly not going to be  the lineback you've always dreamt to be. Reality is there.

And if there is, I mean, if somebody comes  to you and says, I want to get to know you, you say, fine. So well, I like to think of you as a  demanding, domineering person. You say, how dare you? You don't even really want to know who I am. You've, you can't get to know me by just saying, I want to think, but now look what you've done.

When a person says, I don't want to find a God who won't let me do this or that. I don't want  to be narrow person. And what you're really saying is, I refuse to give to God the same deference I  demand from anybody else who wants to get to know me. See, unless you take your shoes off  from the beginning, that means unless you're willing to find a God who tells you things you don't  want to hear and demands things that you don't want to do, you haven't even begun to search. You  can't start the search objectively.

And then hope that somehow we'll find a God. You've got to  start up by saying, God, if you're there, I'm willing to agree that you may be holy. You may be  fire. Now I said that and you say, wait a minute, if that's the case, oh my goodness,  oh my goodness, oh my goodness, I don't want to God like that. But now the same God who says,  stay back.

I'm holy. Don't just walk into me. Don't just be casual with the spirit of curiosity. You see, show some deference, show some respect. Be willing to surrender to even find me.

But then he's also the guy who says, Moses, Moses, you know, or your name here, whatever your name  is. He says, I want you in. I want to be part of you. I want to come close. In fact, the very  statement, Moses, Moses, stay away is a burning bush.

It's an utter contradiction. What God is saying is, I want to have my holiness in you. But how can God's holiness come in me? How can this great and majestic thing come down into me? You see what God is,  you see what the burning bush is?

The burning bush is the contradiction at the heart of  biblical religion. And that is the true God insists that he is not really holy and maybe a  little loving or not really loving and maybe a little holy, but he's absolutely holy and he's  absolutely loving. He is a burning bush. He is another contradiction. And everybody else in the  world refuses to listen to who he is.

Religious people say he's really holy and we can get to  heaven by trying our best and doing good. In other words, you know, they emphasize the holiness  and not the grace. And that's the reason why we don't like them. And that's the reason why  basically they don't have a God that they really enjoy, but a God of drudgery. And they don't even have  a God they can really get passionate for because they have a God that you can control.

You have a  tame God. If you think you can earn your way to heaven, that's not a fiery God. That's a very tame  God. You bought him off. But on the other hand, the other people don't look at the holiness.

They look at the love. Modern people love the idea of a God who just accepts us, you know,  Mr. Rogers God, right? I love you just the way you are. And I just love and accept you.

And that  also is not a fiery God. That is a sentimental God. And you're not going to get you don't get passionate  about that. A person who says God is holy and he occasionally forgives. You're not filled with joy  to God like that.

Or God says, yes, he accepts me just the way I am. And there's no cost in  of his love. And you're not accept. There is no fire unless he's both equally. Do you see the  contradiction?

If you insist on going truth or love and not keeping them together, if you insist  on saying, I believe in a God who's really basically demanding God, or I believe in a God who's  a completely loving, accepting God of everybody, if you go either way, you'll never see the true God  because the true God is a fiery God who says, I want a relationship of love with you. This is the reason why Jesus says we pipe the flute for you and you would not dance and we  sang a dirge for you and you would not mourn. Christianity is far more optimistic and pessimistic. Far higher and lower. God says, I am the holy God, but I come down, see, verse 8, in mercy.

Christianity is far more demanding in what God does than any other religion and far more loving  and far more gracious in what God does than any other religion. No other religion has a God  that holy who says, be perfect or you won't get the heaven. God says that in the Bible. No other  religion says that, but on the other hand, no other religion has a God who comes down. And that's  the solution.

The little contradictions will bring you to God. The big contradiction will be in  front of you. Don't leave that. Don't ever compromise. Don't ever move away from what it says.

But what's the solution? How can that holiness come into my life? And the answer is, in the midst of  the burning bush, there's an angel. Not an angel. I'm sorry, did I say an angel?

Very important in  the Old Testament. Whenever you reach, whenever you see an angel and anybody tries to worship an angel,  the angel always says, get up. I'm a creature just like yourself. But in the Old Testament,  there's a very mysterious figure who's called the angel of the Lord. Verse 2,  there the angel of the Lord appeared to him and flames the fire.

Now, how is it possible  that this contradiction can be brought together? And the answer is, the Lord spoke through the angel. There was a mediator in the bush. The angel was in the bush and yet the Lord spoke through  the bush. What?

Through the mediator. There was this figure, this mysterious figure. But this mediator was in the midst of the fire. Why? We know the answer.

All through the Old Testament, God says, the way you can live with a holy God and have a personal  relationship with me is if someone substitutes and takes your punishment. And so over and over and  over again, sacrifices were made into the fire of God's holiness. When you were guilty, you made  a sacrifice and you asked for forgiveness. And it was a substitute. Something was slain and put  into the fire.

But the New Testament tells us why. Because there was one who went in and by one  sacrifice through himself into the fire, he was consumed so that we will not have to be consumed. And because Jesus Christ was consumed by the holy wrath of God, we are able to become  burning bushes ourselves. Do you know what a burning bush is? A burning bush is someone with  the holiness of God in us, but it doesn't destroy us.

You know what that means? A Christian is  someone filled with power, personality, and dwelling personality. Secondly, a Christian is someone  with beauty. In fact, there is no better picture of what Martin Luther called the card of the gospel,  symbol used to set peccator. Simultaneously, when you become a Christian, because Jesus Christ  is not for you, you are simultaneously just and sinful.

Simultaneously, you're beautiful but a bush. You know, not a giant redwood sequoia. You know, when you become a Christian, you don't become a  sequoia. You become a burning bush. You're still a bush.

You're still a sinner. And yet,  you're clothed with the righteousness of Jesus. You're filled with the beauty of Jesus. You know, that is what's possible. And it will only be possible.

And you will only turn into a  passionate, burning heart person. If you see not just the God of truth, or just the God of love,  but to see the law by Christful filled, and here is pardoning voice, transforms a slave into a  child and duty into choice. Do you understand? Let the little contradictions drive you to the big  contradiction. And then stay with that.

If this is the first time you've heard of it tonight,  I can tell you this. You probably don't get it yet. I wasn't that clear. There wasn't enough time,  but I tell you please turn aside. And Christian friends, realize this.

If you need to get your  bush burning again, go back and see what Jesus did. Go back and see him consumed in the fire. Go  back and see that because he was burned and consumed, we can burn and not be consumed  with the holy power of God. To the degree you see that. You see, to the degree you see him  burning in the bush, you'll become a bush that burns and is not consumed.

Let's pray. We ask Father that you'd help us to apply these things. A lot of us are actually suffering right  now and we're just grumpy about it. We're just mad about it. Instead of seeing that this is your  way of turning us aside with contradictions and bringing us into the heart of the great contradiction,  which is that the law was fulfilled by your love in Jesus Christ.

We ask that you would change  your hearts with these things and apply them to our lives through Jesus and his name we pray. Amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today's podcast, Tim Keller looks at how Ecclesiastes helps us  face our doubts, fears, and uncertainties, and points us to the lasting hope and significance  we have in Christ. You can read from that with me. I'm going to read in Exodus chapter 1, you have verses 1 to 11. I'm going to read all the way down to 14. So when you get to the bottom of the page, just  wait another eight seconds and it'll be over.

Exodus chapter 3 verses 1 to 14. Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law,  the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the desert and came to Horeb,  the mountain of God. There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire from within a  bush. Moses saw that through the bush, that though the bush was on fire, it did not burn up. So Moses thought, I will go over and see this strange sight, why the bush does not burn up.

When the Lord saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush,  Moses, Moses. And Moses said, here I am. What else do you say? Anyway, I've always wondered,  do not come any closer, God said, take off your sandals for the place where you were standing as  holy ground. Then he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,  and the God of Jacob.

At this, Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at God. The Lord said, I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I've heard them crying out  because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering. So I have come down  to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good  and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey, the home of the Canaanites, Hidites,  Amrites, Parasites, Hivites, and Jebiusites. And now the cry of the Israelites has reached  me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them.

So now go, I am sending you to  Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt. But Moses said to God, who am I,  that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt? And God said, I will be with you,  and this will be the sign to you, that it is I who have sent you. When you have brought the people  out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain. And Moses said to God, suppose I go to the Israelites  and say to them, look, God of your fathers has sent me to you, and they ask me, what is his name?

What shall I tell them? God said, I am who I am. This is what you were to say to the Israelites. I am, has sent me to you. This is God's word.

In the beginning here of the fall, we've been  giving some concepts and some guidelines for people who are searching spiritually,  and it's really, well, not everywhere, but it's certainly a plain fact that it's actually  acceptable, even in a secular urban place like New York City. It's now acceptable to say,  I am a spiritual searcher. I am spiritually searching. If you go to Barnes and Noble and you look  at all the new nonfiction books, which I did recently, there was something like 25% of the first  shelf that I saw that had something to do with God, something to do with spirituality, something to  do with soul, something to do. Here are some of the titles.

Here are two of my favorite titles. One  is called Cyber Grace, searching for God in a digital age, searching for God. Okay, here's another one,  not as funny, but same thing. Besides still waters, and the subtitle was searching for meaning in  an age of doubt. Now, as I read these, or surveyed them, of course in Barnes and Noble, you know,  you can sit down and just read them and just stay there.

But as I was surveying and reading them,  I noticed something, and I noticed that the writers of these books are tremendously conflicted,  that's the right word. And here's where the conflict is. Though 10 years ago, even certainly 20 years  ago, if you are a modern, sophisticated, secular, urban type person here in New York, it would not  have been acceptable. It would not have been respectable to say, I'm a spiritual searcher. Today,  it is very respectable.

It's very almost noble. It's insightful. It's wise to say, I'm a spiritual  searcher, but I've noticed when I read the book, that it is not acceptable. It's acceptable to say,  I'm searching, but it's not acceptable to say, I've found anything. It's one thing to say, I'm  searching for God.

None of these books would be up on the shelf if they said, finding God in an  age of doubt, finding God in a digital age. That's what they're not talking about that. And what's  intriguing is, they're all in this kind of bind. It is a bind. They are searching with a tremendous  sphere of finding.

Not a terrible situation to be in. It would think it has to be far more comfortable  to either search, either not search or define, but not to search, not wanting to find. And the reason  for this, I've been thinking about this, I'm looking at this thing and I'm seeing what they say,  and they feel they say, well, I'm a spiritual searcher, but I'm not one of those people that say,  I've found God. I'm not one of those people that believe you can have certainty anymore. Now, here's my belief on that.

Here's my understanding for what I can tell, and sometimes it comes  right out in the books. Most spiritual searchers have been involved in religious institutions. They  were many of them were raised in churches or synagogues or something else. They have some kind of  religious background. And they found that inside religious institutions, religious people  are more angry, more insecure, more judgmental, more hypocritical.

There's more fighting. There's  more pride and prejudice going on inside religious institutions than outside. And religious people say,  I found God. And we don't want to be like them. Now, I want to put it on the record right here  that I agree that by and large, inside religious organizations, religious societies and religious  bodies, there is more insecurity, anger.

There is more fighting. There is more brutality. There  is more abuse. There is more hypocrisy than outside. I will just come out and say, yes.

And therefore,  it's perfectly understandable why people say, I'm searching. See, there's stuck between the smugness  of the religious people they don't want. And their own deep spiritual emptiness. They're stuck. Is there a way out?

Yeah, I think there's a way out. The way out is this. First of all, you have to  recognize a fallacy. And the fallacy is this. Let me put to you this way.

Imagine John Doe. He's  always getting drunk. Why? Well, on Monday night, he got drunk on gin and soda water. On Tuesday night,  he got drunk on vodka and soda water.

On Wednesday night, he got drunk on bourbon and soda water. What is it that's making him drunk? Obviously, the common factor, soda water. That must be what's  making him drunk. Right?

No. Of course not. And yet, here's a narrow person and they think they found  God. Here's a narrow person. They think they found God.

Here's a narrow person. Association is not causation. And for a person who's very narrow and condemning to say,  I found God, doesn't mean at all that the judgmental attitude is caused by the conviction of finding  God. And yet, that's the assumption. It could be that you see there's something else causing it.

There's something else besides religious certainty that they found God. There might be some other  cause. And if that's true, and you get over that fallacy, you can finally go to the book,  which is five far, the most likely book, to tell you something about God. And that's the Bible. In fact, if you go to the Old Testament where you have Judaism and Islam and Christianity,  you put those three together and you have three quarters of the human race or something like that  in terms of the people's tradition.

If you take a look at all that,  you see, they all take a look at the Old Testament and they all say, this is sacred. The only intelligent way to find out how do I find God is to go to the Bible first at least. And when you go to the Bible, you'll see the Bible says you can find God,  not just search for God, but find God. And this particular passage that I read where Moses finds  God is really very, very important because it really gives you all the basic principles. There's three things that we see here, not exactly three things.

There's actually the same thing  looked at more and more deeply. There's burning bush. At first, it's a distracting,  disrupting site. At first, all it is to Moses is a disrupting site. When it gets closer, he sees  it's an unmanageable power.

And when it gets even closer, he sees there's a burning angel in the  middle. And I would like to say to you, as you see each of these three, you are going to pass  through the stages through which you have to go to find God. You have to see the same three  things. You have to know and experience the same three things. What are they?

I'll summarize  at the end. Phenomenally, that means when I'm looking at it from the outside, first of all,  we look at it and it's just a disrupting site. It takes him out of his normal course of action. Then he goes in closer and he sees it's an unmanageable power. And then last of all, he sees  there's a burning angel in the middle of it.

Until you see all three things, until the same  three things happen to you, you can't find God. Now, let's take a look at the three things. Each one  is a stage. First, first of all, the burning bush is a disrupting event. Now, what I mean by  disrupting, notice it says here in verse three and four, says Moses saw that though the bush was  on fire, it did not burn up.

So he said, I will go over and see it. And verse four says the Lord saw  that he had gone over to look. And then he spoke. Now, the word gone over is not a very good translation. This is one of the places where our translation, I think, fails us.

Because we have a very specific  word here that's used twice. And the much better translation would be turn aside. It's a word  that's used in Hebrew to mean go off the beaten path, go off the normal path, go off the main road. Moses was just, what was he doing? He was just moving his flock around.

He was doing his thing. He  was an ordinary life. And unless something came to disrupt ordinary life, he would never have  started to search for God. You know, Moses doesn't say, I think I'll search for God today. Something  has to disrupt him and turn him aside from the normal path because the Bible tells us, ordinary life  makes you too busy and this inclines you to search for God.

What do I mean? Well, you know,  see us Lewis in his book on the screw tape letters. It's a lot of fun. It's a fun thing to read if  you've never read it. It's a quick read.

And it's a fiction book, I hope. And it's about a senior  devil writing letters to his nephew, a junior devil, who's still out on the tempting field. A  senior devil's name, screw tape. Screw tape is a retirement, sort of at least he's up higher in  the bureaucracy now of hell. And, you know, he's giving advice to his nephew.

And he starts to tell  his nephew one of the best ways to make sure that your patient, he calls him, never falls into  the clutches of the enemy, which of course is Jesus. And here's what he says, he says, the trouble  about argument is that it moves the whole struggle onto the enemy's ground. By the very act of  arguing, you awake the patient's reason. And once it's awake, who can foresee the result? Even if a particular strain of thought can be twisted to end in our favor, you will find that  you have been strengthening in your patient the fatal habit of attending to universal issues.

And with drawing attention from the stream of immediate sense experiences, your business  is to fix his attention on that stream. Teach him to call it real life. And don't let him ask what  he means by real. Remember, he's not like you. He's not a pure spirit.

You don't realize how  enslaved these humans are to the pressure of the ordinary. I once had a patient, a sound atheist  who used to read in the British Museum one day, as he sat reading, I saw a train of thought in his  mind beginning to go the wrong way. The enemy, of course, was at his elbow. Before I knew where I was,  I saw my 20 years of great, hard work beginning to totter. If I had lost my head and begun to attempt  a defense by argument, I should have been undone.

But I was not such a fool. I immediately suggested  it was just about time he has some lunch. The enemy presumably made the counter suggestion,  you know how one can never quite over hear what he says to them, that this was more important than  lunch. At least I think that must have been his line for when I said quite. In fact, it's much  too important to tackle at the end of the morning.

The patient brightened up considerably and by the  time I had added much better, come back after lunch and go into it with a fresh mind, he was already  halfway to the door. Once he was in the street, the battle was won. I showed him a newsboy shouting  the midday paper. I showed him a number 73 bus going past as usual. And before he reached the  bottom of the steps, I had gotten into him the unalterable conviction that whatever odd ideas may come  up into a man's head when he's a shut up alone with his books.

A healthy dose of real life by which  he meant the bus and the newsboy I imagine was enough to show him that all that sort of thing just  couldn't be true. He knew he'd had a narrow escape and in later years was fond of talking about  that inarticulate sense of actuality which is our ultimate safeguard against the aberrations of  mirror logic. He is now safe in our father's house below. We're never going to search for God as long  as we're in ordinary life. We're just busy.

We're just carried along. Sense experience keeps us from  asking the question, why am I so busy? What am I doing? What is it accomplishing? What's the  purpose of it all?

What is my life accomplishing? What is it all amounting to? We never asked  that question. We're too busy in ordinary life. Something has to turn us aside.

We'll never do  it on our own. Something has to come and turn us aside or we're stuck. And what is that thing that  has to turn us aside? It's got to be a burning bush. He turned aside and to see the strange sight.

Now, what is a burning bush? The burning bush is something that contradicts the model or view of  reality that you've got. A burning bush is something that is actually a paradigm bomb. It comes inside  your paradigm of what things should be like and it explodes it. Now I'll tell you how a burning  bush works.

The burning bush works like this. If such and such is true, which I think it is,  then such things couldn't happen. But there's one of those things. Therefore such and such can't be true. Got that?

See, I believe such and such. And if such and such, then this can't be, this can never  happen. But this just happened. Therefore such and such can't be true. That's a burning bush.

See,  in this case, if you're empiricist, if you're somebody who says, well, I just believe in what's  here and now, I believe that everything is a natural cause. I don't believe in the supernatural. I  don't believe in mystical things. I just believe everything is a natural cause. Oh, what's a burning  bush?

It's a contradiction. Because a bush is either burning and it's disintegrating  or it's cold and it's intact, but this is a bush that burns and is not consumed. And that means  that there's something more to life and reality. If you don't have a supernatural  view of reality, the burning bush is a paradigm bomb. If this world is all there is, then burning  bushes can't happen.

A burning bush has happened. Therefore, there must be something more to my  view. But my review of reality has to change. Now, a burning bush is the only thing that ever gets  us out of ordinary life and makes us turn aside and think about it and concentrate on it and ask  the big questions. See, now what form is going to burning bush come in?

Oh, my many, many forms,  many forms. Let me give you four quick ones, but they're very important. I mean, this is one of  the main things that this tells us. You'll never find God just by abstractly one day saying,  I think it's about time I'm 35. I should go find God.

That'll never happen. You're stuck  in the stream of ordinary life. Something's got to turn you aside and these are the things that  turn you aside. Let me give you a quick example. Four, one is an inexplicable person can be a burning  bush.

One of my favorite illustrations on this is a woman who this actually is in a book somewhere  I have to go find it, but there's a woman who told how she'd come to Redeemer back in the early days  when Redeemer was rather small. She was someone who never thought much about religion was an  interested in religion, but she worked for a TV network in town and she had a boss. And one day,  she screwed up and if she could have easily lost her job, but the boss took the blame for her  fallout. He was able to keep his job with that kind of thing, but she probably would not have  been able to keep it. And she was amazed.

She said she had a number of bosses who would shift  the blame to her. But she'd never had a boss who took the blame from her. And she was just  astounded. And so she went and she thanked him, but then she kept pushing it. You know, why would  you do that?

And that was awfully nice. Why would you do that? He tried to put her off a little bit  and say, well, thank you. And no, no, it's just something anybody would do. And finally,  he says, all right, I'm a Christian.

And she said, what's that got to do with it? And she says,  well, you know, he says, well, you see in other religions, you know, God does this and that,  but in our religion, our God actually came and took the blame. My Savior took the blame for me  and therefore I can take the blame for other people. Now this was a paradigm bomb because in her mind,  religion made people blamers. That's the only kind of person she'd ever see that got religious  blamers.

You never thought of a religion that could turn you into a taker of blame. You never saw  that. And suddenly she says, maybe this religion is different. Maybe this person is different. She  says, where do you go to church?

And it was redeemer and she started coming. So she had a model and  it blew it up. Let me give you another example. Another kind of burning bush is not an  explicable person, but an inexplicable train of thought. Now what I mean by that is a lot of  secular people are starting to become spiritual searchers because they're starting to think out  the implications of what it means to be a secular person to believe that there's really no  eternity.

There's no supernatural. There's no heaven. Everything is just an accident. Everything is  just a matter. Everything is matter and motion.

Everything is chemistry and biology and physics. That's it. And a lot of people are beginning to say, wait a minute, wait a minute, Jack Miles  in his lead article in the 97 December New York Times magazine, whole issue on spiritual searching. That's the one. The title of it was, religion makes a comeback, belief to follow.

And you see, the title of that shows exactly what I said in the beginning. People are searching. But they're searching for belief. They're searching and they're hungry, but we're not really ready  to find yet. But this is what he says.

This is terrific. He says, can a postmodern path be open for  thinking people to religion that they can practice? If the answer is yes, he's careful. I suspect the  first step on the path will be the religious reflection on the secular loss of faith. The secular loss of faith.

Now listen to this. He says, a man or woman who turns to religion may not  do so to acknowledge the mystery of God or religion, but to acknowledge the mystery in response to  which their religion has come into being. Namely, the felt necessity, mysterious in itself,  to live a moral life even when the grounds of morality cannot be known. Now, I mean it's a little  hard. Unless you've read the whole paragraph in the column, here's what he's saying.

He says,  we are secular people, and therefore there shouldn't be such a thing as morality. There shouldn't,  there's no moral absolutes. I mean, it's all a matter of opinion. There's not such thing as  beauty. It's all a matter of chemistry.

There's no way to say that human beings are more valuable than  rocks or trees or salamanders because we're just accidents. But he says, if my worldview that this  life is all there is is true, then there can't be such a thing as human value. There can't be such a  thing as beauty. There can't be such a thing as real injustice, but there is. And I'm seeing that I  have to live a moral life even though my secular worldview gives me no basis for it.

Now, you see what's  going on? If you're willing to think, see, this guy is completely out of screw tapes control. This  guy is thinking this guy is not looking at the 73 bus. He's starting to think he says, wait a minute,  if secularism is true, then there can't be injustice. There can't be real love.

There can't be  beauty. People really aren't valuable, but they are. And that means that everything almost he's  looking at is becoming a burning bush. And he's going back and saying, if my premises lead me  to a conclusion I know is not true, then I have to go back and check the premises. Maybe there is a god.

You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger brother. In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who try to  earn his love by being good. In his book, The Prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known  story reveals the heart of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother  and the judgmental older brother, and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal,  extravagant grace. Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith,  The Prodigal God will help you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way. The Prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the  hope and joy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the world.

Thirdly, an inexplicable trouble. Now, what I mean by that, troubles are our burning bushes. Oh, my. And here's why. And this is  especially no offense is especially relevant for a crowd that's with so many young people in it  because you're especially in a place like New York.

And who comes to New York? Young people come to  New York. You're the people that work out. You're the people with good grades. You're the people  who have really got your ducks in a row.

You're the people who have come here and you say,  I'm going to work out and I'm going to work real hard. And I've got this plan. I've got that plan. And I can master life. You know, come on world.

I'm ready. And you've got a little paradigm. And the paradigm is if I really, really work hard. If I'm really wise, I'm really careful. If I'm really savvy, I will be able to handle life.

Life is manageable. Oh, no, it's not. And when some, you know, you see yourself as big and life is little and all of a sudden,  the troubles hit you. And you suddenly think, see yourself as some little teeny thing beside  the huge mountain of reality. And you begin to realize that the trouble is a burning bush  that is smashing your little model of reality, namely that you're competent to run your own life.

That you're wise enough and strong enough to be able to just handle normal life. Most of us think that way until a little, until a trouble comes. You can't do it by yourself. You can't be your own Savior. You can't be your own Lord.

Here's the last one. Burning bush can be an inexplicable person, can be an inexplicable  train of thought, can be an inexplicable trouble, but it also can be an inexplicable emptiness. Now, actually, if you were here last week, we talked about this. We had an open forum and we  talked about success. And I made a reference to one of my favorite quotes as a column by Cynthia  Heimel in the Village Voice some years ago in which she talked about the fact that she knew an  awful lot of people who had been not famous and they became famous.

She knew a lot of movie stars  before they became famous. And she found out after they became famous, they got to be extremely  angry, extremely upset, extremely manic, extremely depressed. And here's a part of her article I  didn't read last week. She says, I believe that when God wants to play a really rotten joke on you,  he grants you your deepest wish and then giggles mirrorly as you suddenly realize you want to kill  yourself. Now, you know why she says that?

She says that everybody she knows, who's ever gotten  their fondest dreams and there's not that many. People who've dreamt of fame, they get it, dreamt of  wealth, they get it, dreamt of some kind of success, they get it. She says, the few people she knows  go berserk because they think that that is what surely is going to fulfill the minute it didn't. That's surely what's going to make them feel good about themselves and it doesn't. That's  surely what's going to really make life great now and it hasn't.

And as a result, they suddenly  realize, oh my gosh, there is a vacuum in me huge and their paradigm and that is that this is  salvation. This is what life's about, completely is destroyed. Success and the emptiness that  always comes with success is the maybe the most powerful of all of the burning bushes. You see? But you have to have one or you'll never find God.

They've got to come in and notice they're almost  all in pleasant, unless your boss takes, you know, saves your job. That's the best kind. But  they tend to be very unpleasant. They tend to be foolish, stormy and strong. They really are  very, very hard.

And so listen, when they come, here's what I suggest. Those of you who are searching,  it could be that this has happened to you. It could be that you're in the very beginning. Something  like this has come into your life and you've turned aside. Good.

Would you please turn aside? What does it mean to turn aside? If what if Moses had looked at his watch and said, I got to get  the flock home by eight o'clock? You never would have heard of Moses. He never would have met God.

Why? Because he was in ordinary life. He was just in the stream. You have to turn aside. You have to spend  time.

You have to read. You have to think you have to become vulnerable to a degree because you've  got to talk to somebody about these things. And boy, who knows, you know, what that will lead to? You've got to turn aside. You've got to give it time.

You've got to. You've got to make room. Oh, do. Now, Christians, if you say, well, this isn't about me, is it? Of course it is.

And here's why. I know you're not going to want to hear this, but here's what here it is. The way to find more of God  is always happens on the same principles on the same principles on which you find God. In other words,  the same principles for finding more of God are the principles on which you find God, which means  if you're just sort of moving along in the ordinary stream of life as a Christian,  you're never going to get deeper unless something comes in and smashes the little paradigms. And the reason why we are not growing, the reason we are not more like Christ is not simply  that we need to try harder.

Always the reason why we're not more like Christ is because our understanding  of the gospel or understanding of Jesus or understanding of what the Bible teaches about God  is faulty. We read it. We think we understand it. Oh, in other words, the average Christian says,  Jesus is my meaning in life. I am a Christian.

I'm born again. I'm a Christian. Jesus is my meaning in  life. And then along comes some kind of career failure. And you're ready to slit your throat.

And what does that mean? You thought Jesus was your meaning in life. You thought Jesus was your  righteousness, that Jesus was your honor and your glory. You thought that you were saved by what Jesus  has done, not by what you're doing. And then along comes this little paradigm.

I'm in blows it up  and it's just not in the case at all. You thought you were depending on God and then come along,  along comes some kind of burning bush. Or you thought you understood God and then suddenly  something happens. You say, God should never let such a thing happen. Well, in your view of God  that could never, nothing like that should ever happen, but it happened.

It's happened there. It  is the burning bush. You see? And because it's there, that means your view of God is wrong. Don't  get mad at God.

Realize it's your view of God. It's your model of reality. There is no way to find  more of God without doing it the same way you found God to start with. Secondly, after he turns  aside and he comes on in, he realizes that God has something to say to him. Now a lot of people  turn aside and they start to come in, but they don't hear this.

And here's the best way to put  this. It's a little contradiction, a little contradiction that always gets you into a search mode. It's these contradictions of persons or troubles or intellectual trains of thought and so on,  but the way you know you're right at the threshold of actually finding God is when you come to see  the big contradiction. Little contradictions lead you to a big contradiction. And here's the big  contradiction.

Unless you've felt this, unless you've wrestled with this, unless this is born down on  you, you're not going to meet the real God. And the big contradiction is this. He speaks to Moses  and this is what he says. Moses, Moses, do not come any closer. Now that is an incredible contradiction.

Why? I'll tell you why. On the one hand and then on the other hand, first of all, Moses,  Moses. Now in English, this doesn't seem to work because we say Moses, Moses, okay, what does that  mean? In Hebrew, the doubling of a word means magnitude.

In the Old Testament, there's many places  where in your translations, you're reading the Old Testament in English and it'll say things like  great pits. They fell into the great pits. That's not like in Genesis 18 or something. They fell  into great pits. But if you're actually reading in Hebrew, it'll say the pit pits because in Hebrew,  the way to say big pits is to say pit pits, okay?

And when you double a proper name,  like when David doesn't just say Absalom, but it says Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son,  when Jesus says Simon, Simon, Satan wanted to have you and sift you like wheat when Jesus says Martha  The doubling of a name means emotional intensity, magnitude of relationship. Now it always means I want to have a relationship with you. It always means love. It always means  intensity. Now are you starting to figure this out?

When Moses walks up, God says I want you closer. Go away. Moses, Moses, don't come any closer. Now wait a minute. Do you see?

He's saying come closer. Stop. Take off your shoes. This is holy ground. What's going on here?

On the one hand, he's being told  I am a holy God. That's the reason why the God is a God of fire. Fire means holiness. Fire means  justice. Fire means majesty.

Fire means I am what I am. Not what you want me to be. When Moses said what is your name? God did not say my name is I am what you want. No.

What God said the Moses is I am what I am. You see, if his name was I am what I want,  it wouldn't have been a fiery, but it would have been clay. You can do what do you want with him? People are constantly doing this. They start right out saying this.

They say well I just am looking  for God. You got your faith and that's good for you and it helps you. That's fine for you. And it's true for you. But if I can find a faith, I need a faith.

It's true for me. And so when they  ask me, well I'm interested in being a Christian, you shall say now to Christians believe this,  I mean if I become a Christian, well I have to do this and this, I don't want to have to do this  and I don't have to do this. Now you know what's going on? That's a clay God. That's not a fiery God.

What you're looking for is a God that fits you instead of a God that you fit. You see in clay,  it's molded by the toucher, but fire melts the touchy. I mean the toucher comes in and touches clay  and of course the clay gives to the toucher. But fire, if you touch the fire, turns you to clay. And what God is saying right off the bat is, if you want the real God, you've got to look for a God  that can contradict you.

If you want the real God, you've got to look for a God. You have to be  willing to see a God who's going to tell you things you don't want to hear. When somebody says,  let me go right out. When somebody says, you know, I've got a girlfriend, I've got a boyfriend. I don't want to be a Christian if it means getting in the way of that.

Now here's what you're saying. It's an utter contradiction. You're in the stream of life, so you're not being logical. So let me get you out. What you're saying is, I know who I am before I even know who he is.

I haven't even met God, but I know what I need. I haven't met God, but I know what sex ethics are. I haven't even met God, but I know what my needs are. How could you know who you are before you  even met him if he's the creator? If there is a creator, if he's done all this, which means you  can't even begin to search for this God, a real God without taking your shoes off.

You see, God doesn't say, I want to meet you, and then you can take your shoes off. He says,  you're not even going to meet me until you take your shoes off first. And what that means,  you have got to say, God, if you're there, I am willing to do things that right now I don't like. And if you're not willing to say that, and most most modern people are not,  then what you've actually done is you're saying, I'm looking for God, but you're not looking for God,  you're not looking for a real God, reality is not what you want it to be. Don't you know that by now?

Reality is always itself. You can't really change. I mean, you're, you know, all right, guy,  you're 125 pounds, and you're five foot six, and you're working out, you're never going to play  professional football. I don't care. Never.

You can do everything you want. You're just not going  to be able to do it. You probably won't even be able to be a kicker. But certainly not going to be  the lineback you've always dreamt to be. Reality is there.

And if there is, I mean, if somebody comes  to you and says, I want to get to know you, you say, fine. So well, I like to think of you as a  demanding, domineering person. You say, how dare you? You don't even really want to know who I am. You've, you can't get to know me by just saying, I want to think, but now look what you've done.

When a person says, I don't want to find a God who won't let me do this or that. I don't want  to be narrow person. And what you're really saying is, I refuse to give to God the same deference I  demand from anybody else who wants to get to know me. See, unless you take your shoes off  from the beginning, that means unless you're willing to find a God who tells you things you don't  want to hear and demands things that you don't want to do, you haven't even begun to search. You  can't start the search objectively.

And then hope that somehow we'll find a God. You've got to  start up by saying, God, if you're there, I'm willing to agree that you may be holy. You may be  fire. Now I said that and you say, wait a minute, if that's the case, oh my goodness,  oh my goodness, oh my goodness, I don't want to God like that. But now the same God who says,  stay back.

I'm holy. Don't just walk into me. Don't just be casual with the spirit of curiosity. You see, show some deference, show some respect. Be willing to surrender to even find me.

But then he's also the guy who says, Moses, Moses, you know, or your name here, whatever your name  is. He says, I want you in. I want to be part of you. I want to come close. In fact, the very  statement, Moses, Moses, stay away is a burning bush.

It's an utter contradiction. What God is saying is, I want to have my holiness in you. But how can God's holiness come in me? How can this great and majestic thing come down into me? You see what God is,  you see what the burning bush is?

The burning bush is the contradiction at the heart of  biblical religion. And that is the true God insists that he is not really holy and maybe a  little loving or not really loving and maybe a little holy, but he's absolutely holy and he's  absolutely loving. He is a burning bush. He is another contradiction. And everybody else in the  world refuses to listen to who he is.

Religious people say he's really holy and we can get to  heaven by trying our best and doing good. In other words, you know, they emphasize the holiness  and not the grace. And that's the reason why we don't like them. And that's the reason why  basically they don't have a God that they really enjoy, but a God of drudgery. And they don't even have  a God they can really get passionate for because they have a God that you can control.

You have a  tame God. If you think you can earn your way to heaven, that's not a fiery God. That's a very tame  God. You bought him off. But on the other hand, the other people don't look at the holiness.

They look at the love. Modern people love the idea of a God who just accepts us, you know,  Mr. Rogers God, right? I love you just the way you are. And I just love and accept you.

And that  also is not a fiery God. That is a sentimental God. And you're not going to get you don't get passionate  about that. A person who says God is holy and he occasionally forgives. You're not filled with joy  to God like that.

Or God says, yes, he accepts me just the way I am. And there's no cost in  of his love. And you're not accept. There is no fire unless he's both equally. Do you see the  contradiction?

If you insist on going truth or love and not keeping them together, if you insist  on saying, I believe in a God who's really basically demanding God, or I believe in a God who's  a completely loving, accepting God of everybody, if you go either way, you'll never see the true God  because the true God is a fiery God who says, I want a relationship of love with you. This is the reason why Jesus says we pipe the flute for you and you would not dance and we  sang a dirge for you and you would not mourn. Christianity is far more optimistic and pessimistic. Far higher and lower. God says, I am the holy God, but I come down, see, verse 8, in mercy.

Christianity is far more demanding in what God does than any other religion and far more loving  and far more gracious in what God does than any other religion. No other religion has a God  that holy who says, be perfect or you won't get the heaven. God says that in the Bible. No other  religion says that, but on the other hand, no other religion has a God who comes down. And that's  the solution.

The little contradictions will bring you to God. The big contradiction will be in  front of you. Don't leave that. Don't ever compromise. Don't ever move away from what it says.

But what's the solution? How can that holiness come into my life? And the answer is, in the midst of  the burning bush, there's an angel. Not an angel. I'm sorry, did I say an angel?

Very important in  the Old Testament. Whenever you reach, whenever you see an angel and anybody tries to worship an angel,  the angel always says, get up. I'm a creature just like yourself. But in the Old Testament,  there's a very mysterious figure who's called the angel of the Lord. Verse 2,  there the angel of the Lord appeared to him and flames the fire.

Now, how is it possible  that this contradiction can be brought together? And the answer is, the Lord spoke through the angel. There was a mediator in the bush. The angel was in the bush and yet the Lord spoke through  the bush. What?

Through the mediator. There was this figure, this mysterious figure. But this mediator was in the midst of the fire. Why? We know the answer.

All through the Old Testament, God says, the way you can live with a holy God and have a personal  relationship with me is if someone substitutes and takes your punishment. And so over and over and  over again, sacrifices were made into the fire of God's holiness. When you were guilty, you made  a sacrifice and you asked for forgiveness. And it was a substitute. Something was slain and put  into the fire.

But the New Testament tells us why. Because there was one who went in and by one  sacrifice through himself into the fire, he was consumed so that we will not have to be consumed. And because Jesus Christ was consumed by the holy wrath of God, we are able to become  burning bushes ourselves. Do you know what a burning bush is? A burning bush is someone with  the holiness of God in us, but it doesn't destroy us.

You know what that means? A Christian is  someone filled with power, personality, and dwelling personality. Secondly, a Christian is someone  with beauty. In fact, there is no better picture of what Martin Luther called the card of the gospel,  symbol used to set peccator. Simultaneously, when you become a Christian, because Jesus Christ  is not for you, you are simultaneously just and sinful.

Simultaneously, you're beautiful but a bush. You know, not a giant redwood sequoia. You know, when you become a Christian, you don't become a  sequoia. You become a burning bush. You're still a bush.

You're still a sinner. And yet,  you're clothed with the righteousness of Jesus. You're filled with the beauty of Jesus. You know, that is what's possible. And it will only be possible.

And you will only turn into a  passionate, burning heart person. If you see not just the God of truth, or just the God of love,  but to see the law by Christful filled, and here is pardoning voice, transforms a slave into a  child and duty into choice. Do you understand? Let the little contradictions drive you to the big  contradiction. And then stay with that.

If this is the first time you've heard of it tonight,  I can tell you this. You probably don't get it yet. I wasn't that clear. There wasn't enough time,  but I tell you please turn aside. And Christian friends, realize this.

If you need to get your  bush burning again, go back and see what Jesus did. Go back and see him consumed in the fire. Go  back and see that because he was burned and consumed, we can burn and not be consumed  with the holy power of God. To the degree you see that. You see, to the degree you see him  burning in the bush, you'll become a bush that burns and is not consumed.

Let's pray. We ask Father that you'd help us to apply these things. A lot of us are actually suffering right  now and we're just grumpy about it. We're just mad about it. Instead of seeing that this is your  way of turning us aside with contradictions and bringing us into the heart of the great contradiction,  which is that the law was fulfilled by your love in Jesus Christ.

We ask that you would change  your hearts with these things and apply them to our lives through Jesus and his name we pray. Amen.

今天的播客中,提姆·凯勒探讨传道书如何帮助我们面对疑惑、恐惧和不确定性,并引导我们看到在基督里拥有的持久盼望和意义。你可以和我一起读。我要读出埃及记第一章,你有第1到11节。我要一直读到第14节。所以当你读到页面底部时,再等八秒钟就结束了。

出埃及记第三章第1到14节。那时,摩西牧养他岳父米甸祭司叶忒罗的羊群,他领羊群往旷野的背面去,来到神的山,就是何烈山。耶和华的使者从荆棘里火焰中向摩西显现。摩西观看,不料,荆棘被火烧着,却没有烧毁。摩西说,我要过去看这大异象,这荆棘为何没有烧坏呢。

耶和华见他过去要看,神就从荆棘里呼叫说:摩西!摩西!他说:我在这里。还能说什么呢?不管怎样,我一直在想,神说:不要近前来,当把你脚上的鞋脱下来,因为你所站之地是圣地。又说:我是你父亲的神,是亚伯拉罕的神,以撒的神,雅各的神。

摩西蒙上脸,因为怕看神。耶和华说:我的百姓在埃及所受的困苦,我实在看见了;他们因受督工的辖制所发的哀声,我也听见了。我原知道他们的痛苦。我下来是要救他们脱离埃及人的手,领他们出了那地,到美好、宽阔、流奶与蜜之地,就是到迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人之地。现在以色列人的哀声达到我耳中,我也看见埃及人怎样欺压他们。

故此,我要打发你去见法老,使你可以将我的百姓以色列人从埃及领出来。摩西对神说:我算什么,竟能去见法老,将以色列人从埃及领出来呢?神说:我必与你同在。你将百姓从埃及领出来之后,你们必在这山上侍奉神;这就是我打发你去的证据。摩西对神说:我到以色列人那里,对他们说:你们祖宗的神打发我到你们这里来。他们若问我说,他的名叫什么?我要对他们说什么呢?

神对摩西说:我是自有永有的。又说:你要对以色列人这样说:那自有的打发我到你们这里来。这是神的话语。

在这个秋季的开始,我们一直在为那些在属灵上寻求的人提供一些概念和指导,这实际上,嗯,不是到处都是,但很明显的事实是,现在即使在像纽约市这样世俗的城市环境中,说"我是一个属灵的寻求者"也是可以接受的。我在属灵上寻求。如果你去巴诺书店看看所有的新非小说类书籍,我最近就去看了,我看到的第一个书架上大约有25%的书与神有关,与灵性有关,与灵魂有关。这里有一些书名。

这里是我最喜欢的两个书名。一本叫做《网络恩典》,在数字时代寻找神,寻找神。好吧,这是另一本,不那么有趣,但意思一样。《在静水旁》,副标题是在怀疑的时代寻找意义。现在,当我阅读或浏览这些书时,你知道,在巴诺书店,你可以坐下来就读它们,就待在那里。

但当我浏览和阅读它们时,我注意到一些事情,我注意到这些书的作者非常矛盾,这是对的词。这矛盾在哪里呢。虽然十年前,当然二十年前,如果你是纽约这里的现代、成熟、世俗、城市型人士,说"我是属灵的寻求者"是不可接受的。那不会是受人尊重的。今天,这是非常受尊重的。

这几乎是高尚的。说"我是属灵的寻求者"是有见地的、明智的,但我注意到当我读这些书时,说"我在寻求"是可以接受的,但说"我找到了什么"是不可接受的。说"我在寻找神"是一回事。

如果这些书说"在怀疑的时代找到神"、"在数字时代找到神",它们都不会上架。它们不是在谈论那个。有趣的是,它们都处于这种困境中。这是一种困境。它们带着极大的恐惧在寻求寻找。

这不是一个可怕的处境吗。你会认为要么不寻求要么找到会舒服得多,但不要在不想找到的情况下寻求。这个原因,我一直在思考,我看着这件事,我看到他们所说的,他们觉得他们说,嗯,我是属灵的寻求者,但我不是那些说我找到了神的人。我不是那些相信你还能有确定性的人之一。现在,这是我对此的看法。

这是我从我能看出的理解,有时它就在书中直接显现出来。大多数属灵寻求者都参与过宗教机构。他们中许多人在教会或犹太会堂或其他地方长大。他们有某种宗教背景。他们发现在宗教机构内部,宗教人士更愤怒、更不安全、更爱论断、更虚伪。

里面有更多的争斗。宗教机构内部比外部有更多的骄傲和偏见。宗教人士说,我找到了神。而我们不想像他们那样。现在,我想在这里记录下来,我同意大体上,在宗教组织、宗教社团和宗教团体内部,确实有更多的不安全感、愤怒。

确实有更多的争斗。有更多的残暴。有更多的虐待。有更多的虚伪,而不是外面。我就直接说出来,是的。

因此,人们说"我在寻求"是完全可以理解的。看,他们被困在他们不想要的宗教人士的自鸣得意和他们自己深深的属灵空虚之间。他们被困住了。有出路吗?

是的,我认为有出路。出路是这样的。首先,你必须认识到一个谬误。谬误是这样的。让我这样说。

想象约翰·多伊。他总是喝醉。为什么?嗯,星期一晚上,他喝杜松子酒和苏打水喝醉了。星期二晚上,他喝伏特加和苏打水喝醉了。

星期三晚上,他喝波旁威士忌和苏打水喝醉了。是什么让他喝醉的?显然,共同因素是苏打水。那一定是让他喝醉的东西。对吧?

不。当然不是。然而,这里有一个狭隘的人,他们认为自己找到了神。这里有一个狭隘的人。他们认为自己找到了神。

这里有一个狭隘的人。关联不是因果关系。一个非常狭隘和定罪的人说"我找到了神",并不意味着论断的态度是由找到神的确信所引起的。然而,这就是假设。可能是你看到有其他原因造成的。

除了宗教确定性,即他们找到了神之外,还有其他原因。可能有其他原因。如果这是真的,你克服了那个谬误,你终于可以去看那本书了,这本书是五本书中最有可能告诉你关于神的事情的书。那就是圣经。事实上,如果你看旧约,那里有犹太教、伊斯兰教和基督教,你把这三个放在一起,就人类传统而言,你有四分之三的人类或类似的东西。

如果你看所有这些,你会看到,他们都看旧约,他们都说,这是神圣的。找出如何找到神的唯一明智方法至少是首先去看圣经。当你去看圣经时,你会看到圣经说你可以找到神,不仅仅是寻找神,而是找到神。我读的这段特别的经文,摩西找到神,真的非常非常重要,因为它真的给了你所有的基本原则。我们在这里看到三件事,不完全是三件事。

实际上是同一件事越看越深。有燃烧的荆棘。起初,对摩西来说,它是一个令人分心、令人不安的景象。起初,对摩西来说,它只是一个令人不安的景象。当它靠近时,他看到这是一种无法控制的力量。

当它靠得更近时,他看到中间有一个燃烧的天使。我想对你说,当你看到这三样东西中的每一样时,你将经历你必须经历才能找到神的阶段。你必须看到同样的三样东西。你必须知道并经历同样的三件事。它们是什么?

我最后会总结。从现象上讲,这意味着当我从外面看时,首先,我们看到它,它只是一个令人不安的景象。它让他偏离了正常的行动路线。然后他走近一些,他看到这是一种无法控制的力量。最后,他看到中间有一个燃烧的天使。

除非你看到所有三样东西,除非同样的三件事发生在你身上,否则你无法找到神。现在,让我们看看这三件事。每一个都是一个阶段。首先,首先,燃烧的荆棘是一个破坏性事件。现在,我所说的破坏性是什么意思,注意这里第三和第四节说,摩西看见荆棘被火烧着,却没有烧毁。

于是他说,我要过去看看。第四节说耶和华见他过去要看。然后他说话了。现在,"过去"这个词不是很好的翻译。这是我们的翻译让我们失望的地方之一。

因为我们这里使用了一个非常具体的词,用了两次。更好的翻译应该是"转向旁边"。这是一个在希伯来语中用来表示偏离常路、离开正常道路、离开主干道的词。摩西只是,他在做什么?他只是在赶他的羊群。他在做他的事。

他在过普通的生活。除非有什么东西来打乱普通生活,否则他永远不会开始寻找神。你知道,摩西不会说,我想今天我要寻找神。必须有什么东西打乱他,让他从正常的道路上转向旁边,因为圣经告诉我们,普通的生活让你太忙了,这使你倾向于寻找神。

我是什么意思?嗯,你知道,鲁益师在他的《魔鬼家书》一书中。这很有趣。如果你从未读过它,读起来很快。这是一本小说,我希望如此。它讲述一位资深魔鬼写信给他的侄子,一个还在诱惑领域工作的初级魔鬼。

资深魔鬼的名字叫"螺丝扭"。螺丝扭已经退休了,至少他现在在地狱的官僚体系中处于更高的位置。你知道,他在给他的侄子提建议。他开始告诉他的侄子确保你的病人,他这样称呼他,永远不会落入敌人的魔掌的最佳方法之一,当然敌人就是耶稣。他是这样说的,他说,论证的麻烦在于它把整个斗争移到了敌人的地盘上。通过论证的行为,你唤醒了病人的理性。

一旦它醒了,谁能预见结果呢?即使某一特定的思路可以被扭曲以有利于我们,你也会发现你一直在你的病人身上强化那种致命的习惯,即关注普遍问题。

并从即时感官经验的流中抽出注意力。你的任务是把他的注意力固定在那个流上。教他称之为真实生活。不要让他问"真实"是什么意思。记住,他不像你。他不是纯粹的灵。

你没有意识到这些人类是多么被普通事物的压力所奴役。我曾经有一个病人,一个坚定的无神论者,他常在大英博物馆阅读,有一天,当他坐着读书时,我看到他脑海中的一连串想法开始走错方向。当然,敌人就在他的肘边。在我意识到之前,我看到我二十年的辛勤工作开始动摇了。如果我失去理智,开始试图用论证来防御,我就会被毁了。

但我不是那样的傻瓜。我立即暗示该是他吃午饭的时候了。敌人大概提出了相反的建议,你知道你永远无法听到他对他们说什么,这比午饭更重要。至少我想那一定是他的路线,因为当我说确实如此,事实上,这太重要了,不能在早晨结束时处理。

病人明显振作起来,当我补充说最好午饭后回来,用新鲜的头脑去研究它时,他已经走到门口一半了。一旦他上了街,战斗就赢了。我让他看到一个报童喊着午间报纸。我让他看到一辆73路公共汽车像往常一样驶过。在他走到台阶底部之前,我已经让他产生了不可改变的信念,即无论当一个人独自和他的书关在一起时,什么奇怪的想法可能会出现在他的脑海中。

我想,一剂健康的真实生活——他指的是公共汽车和报童——足以向他表明所有那类东西都不可能是真的。他知道他侥幸逃脱了,在后来的岁月里,他喜欢谈论那种无法言说的现实感,这是我们对抗纯粹逻辑的异常的最终保障。他现在安全地在我们下面父亲的家里了。只要我们处在普通生活中,我们就永远不会去寻找神。我们只是太忙了。

我们只是被带着走。感官经验阻止我们提出问题,我为什么这么忙?我在做什么?它在完成什么?这一切的目的是什么?

我的生活在完成什么?这一切达成了什么?我们从不问这个问题。我们在普通生活中太忙了。必须有什么东西让我们转向旁边。

我们永远不会自己去做。必须有什么东西来让我们转向旁边,否则我们就被困住了。那让我们转向旁边的东西是什么?它必须是燃烧的荆棘。他转向旁边去看这个奇怪的景象。

现在,什么是燃烧的荆棘?燃烧的荆棘是与你所拥有的现实模型或观点相矛盾的东西。燃烧的荆棘实际上是一个范式炸弹。它进入你关于事物应该是什么样子的范式,然后将其炸毁。现在我会告诉你燃烧的荆棘是如何工作的。

燃烧的荆棘是这样工作的。如果某某是真的,我认为它是真的,那么某些事情就不可能发生。但那里有一件那样的事情。因此某某不可能是真的。明白了吗?

看,我相信某某。如果某某,那么这不可能,这永远不会发生。但这刚刚发生了。因此某某不可能是真的。这就是燃烧的荆棘。

看,在这种情况下,如果你是经验主义者,如果你是一个说,嗯,我只相信此时此地的东西的人,我相信一切都是自然原因。我不相信超自然的。我不相信神秘的事物。我只相信一切都是自然原因。哦,什么是燃烧的荆棘?

它是一个矛盾。因为荆棘要么在燃烧并正在瓦解,要么它是冷的并且完好无损,但这是一个燃烧却没有被烧毁的荆棘。这意味着生活和现实还有更多的东西。如果你没有超自然的现实观,燃烧的荆棘就是一个范式炸弹。如果这个世界就是一切,那么燃烧的荆棘就不可能发生。

燃烧的荆棘发生了。因此,我的观点一定还有更多的东西。但我对现实的看法必须改变。现在,燃烧的荆棘是唯一能让我们走出普通生活,让我们转向旁边,思考它,专注于它,问那些大问题的东西。看,现在燃烧的荆棘会以什么形式出现?

哦,我的许多,许多形式,许多形式。让我快速给你四个,但它们非常重要。我的意思是,这是它告诉我们的主要事情之一。你永远不会仅仅通过抽象地某一天说,我想是时候了,我35岁了,我应该去找神,就找到神。

那永远不会发生。你困在普通生活的流中。必须有东西让你转向旁边,这些是让你转向旁边的事情。让我快速举个例子。四个,一个是无法解释的人可以是燃烧的荆棘。

我最喜欢的说明之一是一个女人,这实际上在某个地方的一本书里,我必须去找它,但有一个女人讲述了她如何在早期来到救赎主教会,当时救赎主还相当小。她是一个从未想过宗教、对宗教不感兴趣的人,但她在镇上的一家电视网工作,她有一个老板。有一天,她搞砸了,如果她本来可能很容易丢掉工作,但老板为她承担了责任。他能够保住自己的工作,但她可能无法保住它。她很惊讶。

她说她有几个老板会把责任推给她。但她从未有过一个为她承担责任的老板。她简直惊呆了。所以她去感谢他,但然后她继续追问。你知道,你为什么要那样做?

那太好了。你为什么要那样做?他试图有点敷衍她,说,嗯,谢谢你。不,不,这是任何人都会做的事。最后,他说,好吧,我是基督徒。

她说,那和它有什么关系?她说,什么?你知道,他说,嗯,你看,在其他宗教中,你知道,神做这个做那个,但在我们的宗教中,我们的神实际上来承担了责任。我的救主为我承担了责任,因此我可以为他人承担责任。现在这是一个范式炸弹,因为在她的心目中,宗教让人成为指责者。那是她见过的唯一一种变得虔诚的人,指责者。你从未想过一个能把你变成承担责任者的宗教。你从未见过那个。

突然她说,也许这个宗教是不同的。也许这个人是不同的。她说,你去哪个教会?

那是救赎主,她开始来了。所以她有一个模型,它把它炸毁了。让我再给你一个例子。另一种燃烧的荆棘不是无法解释的人,而是无法解释的思路。现在我的意思是很多世俗的人开始成为属灵的寻求者,因为他们开始思考成为一个世俗的人意味着什么的含义,相信真的没有永恒。

没有超自然的。没有天堂。一切都只是意外。一切都只是物质。一切都是物质和运动。

一切都是化学、生物学和物理学。就是这样。很多人开始说,等一下,等一下,杰克·迈尔斯在他1997年12月《纽约时报杂志》的主打文章中,整个问题都是关于属灵寻求的。就是那个。标题是"宗教卷土重来,信仰紧随其后"。

你看,那个标题恰好显示了我在开头所说的。人们在寻求。但他们在寻求信仰。他们在寻求,他们很饥渴,但我们还没有真正准备好去找。但这是他说的。

这太棒了。他说,对于有思想的人来说,能否开辟一条后现代的道路通向他们可以实践的宗教?如果答案是肯定的,他很小心。我怀疑这条道路上的第一步将是对世俗信仰丧失的宗教反思。世俗信仰的丧失。

现在听这个。他说,转向宗教的男人或女人可能不是为了承认神或宗教的奥秘,而是为了承认对此作出回应而产生的宗教的奥秘。即,即使道德的根据无法知晓,也需要过道德生活的感受到的必要性,这本身就是神秘的。现在,我的意思是这有点难。除非你读了整个段落和专栏,这是他说的。

他说,我们是世俗的人,因此不应该有道德这样的东西。不应该,不存在道德绝对。我的意思是,这都是意见的问题。没有美这样的东西。这都是化学的问题。

没有办法说人类比岩石、树木或蝾螈更有价值,因为我们只是意外。但他说,如果我的世界观,即这个生命就是一切的世界观是真的,那么就不可能有人类价值这样的东西。不可能有美这样的东西。不可能有真正的不公正这样的东西,但有。我看到我必须过道德生活,尽管我的世俗世界观没有给我任何基础。

现在,你看发生了什么?如果你愿意思考,看,这个人完全脱离了螺丝扭的控制。这个人在思考,这个人不是在看73路公共汽车。他开始思考,他说,等一下,如果世俗主义是真的,那么就不可能有不公正。不可能有真爱。

不可能有美。人们真的不是有价值的,但他们是。这意味着他看到的几乎所有东西都在成为燃烧的荆棘。他回过头来说,如果我的前提导致我得出一个我知道不是真的结论,那么我必须回去检查前提。也许有神。

你可能知道浪子的故事,但它不仅仅是关于一个任性的弟弟。事实上,耶稣讲这个故事是为了向那些逃离神的人和那些试图通过行善来赚取他的爱的人说话。在他的书《浪子的神》中,提姆·凯勒展示了这个众所周知的故事如何揭示福音的核心,一个对叛逆的小儿子和论断的大儿子都充满盼望的信息,以及一个邀请所有人体验神浪子般的、挥霍无度的恩典的邀请。无论你是基督徒还是仍在探索信仰,《浪子的神》都会帮助你以全新的方式看待你与基督的关系。《浪子的神》是我们对您本月捐赠的感谢,以帮助"福音与生命"与世界各地的人分享基督恩慈和不懈之爱的盼望和喜乐。

今天就在gospelandlife.com/give索取您的副本。那是gospelandlife.com/give。现在,这里是凯勒博士今天教导的其余部分。所以无法解释的思路可以是燃烧的荆棘。

第三,无法解释的麻烦。现在,我的意思是,麻烦是我们的燃烧荆棘。哦,我的。这是原因。这尤其不冒犯,尤其与有这么多年轻人的人群相关,因为你尤其在像纽约这样的地方。

谁来纽约?年轻人来纽约。你们是那些锻炼身体的人。你们是那些成绩优秀的人。你们是那些真正让自己的鸭子排成一排的人。

你们是那些来到这里说,我要锻炼,我要非常努力地工作的人。我有这个计划。我有那个计划。我可以掌控生活。你知道,来吧世界。

我准备好了。你有一个小范式。范式是如果我真的、真的非常努力地工作。如果我真的很聪明,我真的很小心。如果我真的很精明,我将能够处理生活。

生活是可管理的。哦,不,不是的。当某些,你知道,你把自己看作很大,生活很小,突然,麻烦袭击了你。你突然把自己看作在巨大的现实之山旁边的一个小小的东西。你开始意识到麻烦是一个燃烧的荆棘,正在粉碎你的小现实模型,即你有能力管理自己的生活。

你足够聪明和强大,能够处理正常生活。我们大多数人都这样想,直到一个小的,直到麻烦来临。你不能靠自己做到。你不能成为自己的救主。你不能成为自己的主。

这是最后一个。燃烧的荆棘可以是无法解释的人,可以是无法解释的思路,可以是无法解释的麻烦,但它也可以是无法解释的空虚。现在,实际上,如果你上周在这里,我们谈到了这个。我们有一个开放论坛,我们谈到了成功。我提到了我最喜欢的引用之一,几年前《乡村之声》辛西娅·海默尔的一篇专栏,她谈到她认识很多以前不出名的人,他们变得出名了。

她认识很多电影明星,在他们成名之前。她发现在他们成名后,他们变得极度愤怒、极度不安、极度狂躁、极度沮丧。这是我上周没读的她文章的一部分。她说,我相信当神想对你开一个真正恶劣的玩笑时,他会满足你最深的愿望,然后在镜子般地咯咯笑,当你突然意识到你想自杀时。现在,你知道她为什么这么说吗?

她说她认识的每个人,谁曾经实现了他们最深的梦想,而没有那么多。梦想出名的人,他们得到了,梦想财富的人,他们得到了,梦想某种成功的人,他们得到了。她说,她认识的少数人发疯了,因为他们认为那肯定会满足他们,但没有。那肯定会让他们对自己感觉良好,但没有。那肯定会让生活现在真正变得伟大,但没有。

结果,他们突然意识到,哦天哪,我内心有一个巨大的真空,他们的范式,即这就是救赎。这就是生活的意义,完全被摧毁了。成功和总是伴随成功而来的空虚也许是所有燃烧荆棘中最强大的。明白吗?但你必须有一个,否则你永远找不到神。

它们必须进来,注意它们几乎都是不愉快的,除非你的老板承担,你知道,保住了你的工作。那是最好的一种。但它们往往非常不愉快。它们往往是愚蠢的、狂暴的和强大的。它们真的非常非常艰难。

所以听着,当它们来的时候,这是我的建议。你们那些正在寻求的人,可能这已经发生在你身上了。可能你正处在最开始。类似这样的事情已经进入你的生活,你转向了旁边。好。

你能不能请转向旁边?转向旁边是什么意思?如果摩西看了他的手表说,我必须在八点前把羊群赶回家怎么办?你永远不会听说摩西。他永远不会遇见神。

为什么?因为他在普通生活中。他只是在流中。你必须转向旁边。你必须花时间。

你必须阅读。你必须思考,你必须在某种程度上变得脆弱,因为你必须和某人谈论这些事情。天哪,谁知道,你知道,那会导致什么?你必须转向旁边。你必须给它时间。

你必须。你必须腾出空间。哦,请这样做。现在,基督徒们,如果你说,嗯,这不是关于我的,对吧?当然是。

这是原因。我知道你不会想听这个,但这就是它。找到更多神的方式总是发生在你找到神的相同原则上。换句话说,找到更多神的相同原则就是你找到神的原则,这意味着如果你只是作为基督徒在普通的生活流中移动,你永远不会变得更深,除非有什么东西进来打碎那些小范式。我们不成长的原因,我们不更像基督的原因不仅仅是我们需要更加努力。

我们不更像基督的原因总是因为我们对福音的理解或对耶稣的理解或对圣经教导关于神的理解是错误的。我们读它。我们认为我们理解它。哦,换句话说,普通基督徒说,耶稣是我生命的意义。我是基督徒。

我重生了。我是基督徒。耶稣是我生命的意义。然后某种职业失败来了。你准备割喉自杀。

那意味着什么?你以为耶稣是你生命的意义。你以为耶稣是你的义,耶稣是你的尊荣和荣耀。你以为你是因耶稣所做的而得救,而不是因你正在做的。然后出现了这个小范式。

我在把它炸毁,根本不是这样。你以为你在依靠神,然后出现,出现某种燃烧的荆棘。或者你以为你理解神,然后突然有事情发生。你说,神永远不应该让这样的事情发生。嗯,在你对神的看法中,类似那样的事永远不应该发生,但它发生了。

它已经发生了。它就在那里,燃烧的荆棘。明白吗?因为它在那里,这意味着你对神的看法是错误的。不要对神生气。

意识到这是你对神的看法。这是你的现实模型。没有办法在不用你开始找到神的相同方式来找到更多神。其次,在他转向旁边并走进来之后,他意识到神有话要对他说。现在很多人转向旁边,他们开始走进来,但他们没有听到这个。

这是最好的表达方式。这是一个小矛盾,一个总是让你进入搜索模式的小矛盾。是这些人或麻烦或智力思路等的矛盾,但你知道你正处在真正找到神的门槛上的方式是当你看到大矛盾时。小矛盾引导你到大矛盾。这是大矛盾。

除非你感受到这个,除非你与此搏斗过,除非这已经压在你身上,否则你不会遇见真正的神。大矛盾是这样的。他对摩西说话,这是他说的。摩西,摩西,不要再靠近了。现在这是一个令人难以置信的矛盾。

为什么?我会告诉你为什么。一方面,然后另一方面,首先,摩西,摩西。现在在英语中,这似乎不起作用,因为我们说摩西,摩西,好吧,那是什么意思?在希伯来语中,一个词的重复意味着强度。

在旧约中有很多地方,当你在读旧约的英文翻译时,会说像大坑这样的话。他们掉进了大坑。那不像创世记18章或什么的。他们掉进了大坑。但如果你实际上在读希伯来文,它会说坑坑,因为在希伯来文中,说大坑的方式是说坑坑,好吧?

当你重复一个专有名词时,比如当大卫不只是说押沙龙,而是说押沙龙,押沙龙,我的儿子,我的儿子,当耶稣说西门,西门,撒但想要得着你,筛你像筛麦子一样,当耶稣说马大,重复一个名字意味着情感强度,关系的强度。现在它总是意味着我想与你建立关系。它总是意味着爱。它总是意味着强度。现在你开始明白这个了吗?

当摩西走上去时,神说我要你靠近。走开。摩西,摩西,不要再靠近了。现在等一下。你看到了吗?

他在说靠近。停。脱掉你的鞋。这是圣地。这是怎么回事?

一方面,他被告知我是圣洁的神。这就是神是火之神的原因。火意味着圣洁。火意味着公义。火意味着威严。

火意味着我是我所是。不是你想要我成为的样子。当摩西说你的名字是什么?神没有说我的名字是我是你想要的。不。

神对摩西说的是我是我所是。你看,如果他的名字是我是我想要的,它就不会是火,而会是泥土。你可以随心所欲地对待他。人们不断地这样做。他们一开始就这样说。

他们说,嗯,我只是在寻找神。你有你的信仰,那对你很好,它对你有帮助。那对你很好。对你来说是真的。但如果我能找到一个信仰,我需要一个信仰。

对我来说是真的。所以当他们问我,嗯,我有兴趣成为基督徒,你应该说现在对基督徒相信这个,我的意思是如果我成为基督徒,嗯,我必须做这个和这个,我不想必须做这个,我不必须做这个。现在你知道发生了什么吗?那是一个泥土之神。那不是火热的神。

你寻找的是一个适合你的神,而不是一个你适合的神。你看泥土中,它被触摸者塑造,但火融化触摸的人。我的意思是触摸者进来触摸泥土,当然泥土给触摸者。但火,如果你触摸火,会把你变成泥土。神一开始就在说,如果你想要真正的神,你必须寻找一个可以与你矛盾的神。

如果你想要真正的神,你必须寻找一个神。你必须愿意看到一个会告诉你你不想听的事情的神。当有人说,让我直说出来。当有人说,你知道,我有女朋友,我有男朋友。如果这意味着妨碍那个,我不想成为基督徒。

现在这是你在说的。这是完全的矛盾。你在生活的流中,所以你不符合逻辑。所以让我把你弄出来。你在说的是,在我甚至不知道他是谁之前,我就知道我是谁。

我还没有遇见神,但我知道我需要什么。我还没有遇见神,但我知道性伦理是什么。我甚至还没有遇见神,但我知道我的需要是什么。如果他是创造者,在你甚至遇见他之前,你怎么能知道你是谁?如果有一个创造者,如果他做了这一切,这意味着你甚至不能开始寻找这个神,一个真正的神,而不脱掉你的鞋。

你看,神没有说,我想见你,然后你可以脱掉你的鞋。他说,在你脱掉鞋子之前,你甚至不会见到我。那意味着什么,你必须说,神,如果你在那里,我愿意做现在我不喜欢的事情。如果你不愿意这样说,而大多数现代人不愿意,那么你实际上所做的是你在说,我在寻找神,但你不是在寻找神,你不是在寻找真正的神,现实不是你想要它成为的样子。你现在还不知道吗?

现实总是它自己。你不能真的改变。我的意思是,你,你知道,好吧,伙计,你125磅,你五英尺六英寸,你在锻炼,你永远不会打职业橄榄球。我不在乎。永远不会。

你可以做你想要的一切。你就是做不到。你可能甚至无法成为一个踢球手。但肯定不会成为你一直梦想成为的后卫。现实就在那里。

如果有,我的意思是,如果有人来找你说,我想了解你,你说,好。那么好吧,我喜欢把你想象成一个苛求的、专横的人。你说,你怎么敢?你甚至不真正想知道我是谁。你,你不能通过只是说,我想,来了解我,但现在看你做了什么。

当一个人说,我不想找到一个不让我做这个或那个的神。我不想成为狭隘的人。你真正在说的是,我拒绝给神我要求任何想要了解我的人的同样尊重。看,除非你从一开始就脱掉你的鞋,这意味着除非你愿意找到一个告诉你你不想听的事情和要求你不想做的事情的神,你甚至还没有开始寻求。你不能客观地开始寻求。

然后希望以某种方式我们会找到一个神。你必须一开始就说,神,如果你在那里,我愿意同意你可能是圣洁的。你可能是火。现在我这么说,你说,等一下,如果是这样的话,哦天哪,哦天哪,哦天哪,我不想要那样的神。但现在说退后的同一个神。

我是圣洁的。不要只是带着好奇的精神随便走进我。你看,表现出一些尊重,表现出一些尊重。愿意投降甚至找到我。但然后他也是那个说,摩西,摩西,你知道,或者你的名字在这里,不管你的名字是什么的家伙。

他说,我要你进来。我想成为你的一部分。我想靠近。事实上,这个非常的陈述,摩西,摩西,离开,是一个燃烧的荆棘。这是一个彻底的矛盾。

神在说的是,我想让我的圣洁在你里面。但神的圣洁怎么能进入我?这个伟大而威严的东西怎么能降到我里面?你看神是什么,你看燃烧的荆棘是什么?

燃烧的荆棘是圣经宗教核心的矛盾。那就是真正的神坚持他不是真的圣洁也许有一点爱,或者不是真的有爱也许有一点圣洁,而是他绝对圣洁,他绝对有爱。他是一个燃烧的荆棘。他是另一个矛盾。世界上其他所有人都拒绝听他是谁。

宗教人士说他真的很圣洁,我们可以通过尽我们最大的努力和做好事上天堂。换句话说,你知道,他们强调圣洁而不是恩典。这就是为什么我们不喜欢他们的原因。这就是为什么基本上他们没有一个他们真正享受的神,而是一个苦役的神。他们甚至没有一个他们可以真正热衷的神,因为他们有一个你可以控制的神。

你有一个驯服的神。如果你认为你可以通过自己的努力赚取上天堂的方式,那不是一个火热的神。那是一个非常驯服的神。你把他买通了。但另一方面,另一些人不看圣洁。

他们看爱。现代人喜欢一个只是接纳我们的神的想法,你知道,罗杰斯先生的神,对吧?我就是喜欢你现在的样子。我只是爱和接纳你。

那也不是一个火热的神。那是一个感伤的神。你不会对此感到热情。你不会对此充满激情。一个说神是圣洁的,他偶尔宽恕的人。

你不会对那样的神充满喜悦。或者神说,是的,他就像我一样接受我。他的爱没有代价。结果,你不接受。除非他两者都是,否则没有火。

你看到矛盾了吗?如果你坚持要真理或爱,而不是把它们放在一起,如果你坚持说,我相信一个真的基本上是苛求的神,或者我相信一个完全有爱、接纳每个人的神,如果你走任何一条路,你永远不会看到真正的神,因为真正的神是一个火热的神,他说,我想与你建立爱的关系。这就是为什么耶稣说我们为你吹笛,你不跳舞,我们为你唱哀歌,你不哀悼。基督教远比悲观乐观得多。远高远低。神说,我是圣洁的神,但我降下来,看,第8节,在怜悯中。

基督教在神所做的事情上比任何其他宗教都要求得多,在神所做的事情上也比任何其他宗教都更有爱和更恩慈。没有其他宗教有一个圣洁的神说,要完美否则你不会上天堂。神在圣经中这么说。没有其他宗教这么说,但另一方面,没有其他宗教有一个降下来的神。这就是解决方案。

小矛盾会把你带到神面前。大矛盾会在你面前。不要离开那个。永远不要妥协。永远不要远离它所说的。

但解决方案是什么?那圣洁怎么能进入我的生命?答案是,在燃烧的荆棘中间,有一个使者。不是使者。对不起,我说的是使者吗?

在旧约中非常重要。每当你到达,每当你看到一个使者,任何人试图敬拜使者,使者总是说,起来。我和你自己一样是受造物。但在旧约中,有一个非常神秘的人物被称为耶和华的使者。第2节,耶和华的使者从火焰中向他显现。

现在,怎么可能把这个矛盾结合在一起?答案是,主通过使者说话。荆棘中有一位中保。使者在荆棘中,然而主通过荆棘说话。什么?

通过中保。有这个人物,这个神秘的人物。但这个中保在火中。为什么?我们知道答案。

整个旧约中,神说,你能与圣洁的神生活并与我建立个人关系的方式是如果有人代替并承担你的惩罚。所以一遍又一遍又一遍,献祭被做进神的圣洁之火中。当你有罪时,你献上祭物,你请求宽恕。这是一个替代品。有东西被宰杀并放入火中。

但新约告诉我们为什么。因为有一个人进去了,通过一次献祭,通过他自己进入火中,他被烧尽了,这样我们就不必被烧尽。因为耶稣基督被神的圣洁愤怒所烧尽,我们能够自己成为燃烧的荆棘。你知道燃烧的荆棘是什么吗?燃烧的荆棘是有神的圣洁在我们里面,但它不会毁灭我们的人。

你知道那意味着什么?基督徒是充满能力、个性和居住个性的人。其次,基督徒是有美丽的人。事实上,没有比马丁·路德所说的福音卡更好的图画了,符号用来设定罪人。同时,当你成为基督徒时,因为耶稣基督不是为了你,你同时是公义和有罪的。同时,你美丽但是一个荆棘。

你知道,不是巨大的红木巨杉。你知道,当你成为基督徒时,你不会成为巨杉。你成为燃烧的荆棘。你仍然是荆棘。你仍然是罪人。

然而,你被耶稣的义所覆盖。你充满了耶稣的美丽。你知道,那是可能的。而且只有可能。只有当你看到的不仅是真理的神,或只是爱的神,而是看到被基督充满的律法,这里是赦免的声音,将奴隶变成孩子,将责任变成选择,你才会变成一个充满激情、燃烧的心的人。

你明白吗?让小矛盾驱使你到大矛盾。然后坚持那个。如果这是你今晚第一次听说它,我可以告诉你这个。你可能还没有得到它。

我说得不够清楚。时间不够,但我告诉你请转向旁边。基督徒朋友们,意识到这一点。如果你需要让你的荆棘再次燃烧,回去看看耶稣做了什么。回去看看他在火中被烧尽。

回去看看因为他被烧毁和烧尽,我们可以燃烧而不被神的圣洁力量烧尽。在你看到那个的程度上。你看,在你看到他在荆棘中燃烧的程度上,你会成为一个燃烧而不被烧尽的荆棘。

让我们祈祷。父啊,我们请求你帮助我们应用这些事情。我们中许多人现在实际上正在受苦,我们只是对此感到不满。我们只是对此感到生气。而不是看到这是你用矛盾让我们转向旁边的方式,并把我们带入伟大矛盾的核心,即律法通过你在耶稣基督里的爱得以实现。

我们请求你用这些事情改变你的心,并通过耶稣将它们应用到我们的生命中,奉他的名祷告。阿门。

在今天的播客中，提姆·凯勒探讨了传道书如何帮助我们面对疑虑、恐惧和不确定性，并指引我们看到在基督里拥有的持久盼望和意义。你可以和我一起阅读。我要读出埃及记第一章，第1到11节。我会一直读到第14节。所以当你读到页面底部时，再等八秒钟就结束了。

出埃及记第3章第1到14节。摩西牧养他岳父米甸祭司叶忒罗的羊群，他领羊群往旷野的背面去，来到神的山，就是何烈山。耶和华的使者从荆棘里火焰中向摩西显现。摩西看见荆棘被火烧着，却没有烧毁。于是摩西说，我要过去看这大异象，这荆棘为何没有烧坏呢。

耶和华见他过去要看，神就从荆棘里呼叫说，摩西，摩西。他说，我在这里。你还能说什么呢？不管怎样，我一直在想，神说，不要走近，把你脚上的鞋脱下来，因为你所站之地是圣地。又说，我是你父亲的神，是亚伯拉罕的神，以撒的神，雅各的神。

摩西蒙上脸，因为怕看神。耶和华说，我的百姓在埃及所受的困苦，我实在看见了。他们因受督工的辖制所发的哀声，我也听见了，我原知道他们的痛苦。我下来是要救他们脱离埃及人的手，领他们出了那地，到美好宽阔流奶与蜜之地，就是到迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人之地。现在以色列人的哀声达到我耳中，我也看见埃及人怎样欺压他们。

故此，我要打发你去见法老，使你可以将我的百姓以色列人从埃及领出来。摩西对神说，我是什么人，竟能去见法老，将以色列人从埃及领出来呢？神说，我必与你同在。你将百姓从埃及领出来之后，你们必在这山上事奉我，这就是我打发你去的证据。当你领

把百姓从埃及领出来，你们要在这山上敬拜神。摩西对神说，假如我去见以色列人，对他们说，看哪，你们祖先的神差我到你们这里来，他们若问我，他的名字是什么？

我该怎么回答他们？神说，我是自有永有的。你要对以色列人这样说：那自有的差我到你们这里来。这是神的话语。

在堕落之初，我们一直在为那些在属灵上寻求的人提供一些概念和指引，这确实是，虽然不是到处都这样，但显然一个明显的事实是，即使在像纽约市这样世俗化的都市，现在说"我是一个属灵的寻求者，我在寻求属灵之事"也是可以接受的。如果你去巴诺书店看看所有新出版的非虚构类图书，我最近去看了，第一个书架上大约有25%的书都与神有关，与灵性有关，与灵魂有关。以下是一些书名。

这是我最喜欢的两个书名。一本叫《网络恩典》，副标题是"在数字时代寻找神"，寻找神。好的，这是另一本，虽然不那么有趣，但意思相同。《静水之旁》，副标题是"在怀疑时代寻找意义"。当我阅读或浏览这些书时，你知道，在巴诺书店，你可以坐下来读这些书，就待在那里。

但当我浏览和阅读它们时，我注意到一些事情，我注意到这些书的作者极其矛盾，这是恰当的词。矛盾在哪里呢？虽然十年前，当然二十年前，如果你是一个现代的、世故的、世俗的、都市类型的纽约人，说"我是一个属灵的寻求者"是不会被接受的。这不会受到尊重。而今天，这非常受尊重。

这几乎是高尚的。说"我是一个属灵的寻求者"是有洞察力的，是明智的，但我注意到当我读这本书时，有些事情是不可接受的。说"我在寻求"是可以接受的，但说"我找到了什么"是不可接受的。说"我在寻找神"是一回事。

如果这些书说的是"在怀疑时代寻找上帝"，或"在数字时代寻找上帝"，它们就不会被放在书架上。它们不是在谈论那个。而有趣的是，它们都陷入了这样一种困境。这是一种困境。他们在搜寻，却极度害怕找到。

这并不是一个糟糕的处境。想想看，要么搜寻、要么不搜寻，要么找到，但不是既搜寻又不想找到，这样会舒服得多。而这其中的原因，我一直在思考这个问题，我看着这些内容，看到他们所说的，他们感觉并说：好吧，我是一个灵性探索者，但我不是那些说"我已经找到上帝"的人。我不是那些相信你还能拥有确定性的人。现在，这是我对此的看法。

根据我所能了解的情况，这是我的理解，有时这在书中就直接写出来了。大多数灵性探索者都参与过宗教机构。他们中的许多人是在教会、犹太教堂或其他地方长大的。他们有某种宗教背景。他们发现在宗教机构内部，宗教人士更加愤怒、更加不安全感、更加论断人、更加虚伪。

那里有更多的争斗。宗教机构内部比外部有更多的骄傲和偏见。而那些宗教人士说："我找到了上帝。"我们不想像他们那样。现在，我想在这里明确表明，我同意总体而言，在宗教组织、宗教社团和宗教团体内部，确实有更多的不安全感、愤怒。

确实有更多的争斗。有更多的残暴。有更多的虐待。有更多的虚伪，比外部更严重。我会直接说，是的。

因此，人们说"我在探索"是完全可以理解的。看，他们被困在他们不想要的宗教人士的自满和他们自己内心深处的灵性空虚之间。他们被困住了。有出路吗？

是的，我认为有出路。出路是这样的。首先，你必须认识到一个谬误。这个谬误是这样的。让我这样说。

想象一下约翰·多伊。他总是喝醉。为什么？嗯，

星期一晚上，他喝金酒加苏打水喝醉了。星期二晚上，他喝伏特加加苏打水喝醉了。

星期三晚上，他喝波旁威士忌加苏打水喝醉了。是什么让他喝醉的呢？显然，共同的因素是苏打水。一定是苏打水让他喝醉的。对吧？

不对。当然不是。然而，这里有一个心胸狭隘的人，他们以为自己找到了神。这里有一个心胸狭隘的人。他们以为自己找到了神。

这里有一个心胸狭隘的人。关联不等于因果。一个非常狭隘和爱论断的人说"我找到了神"，并不意味着这种论断的态度是由找到神的确信所引起的。然而，这就是人们的假设。可能是你看到有其他东西在引起这种态度。

除了"找到神"的宗教确信之外，还有其他东西在引起这种态度。可能有其他原因。如果这是真的，而你克服了这种谬误，你终于可以去看那本书了，那是迄今为止最有可能告诉你关于神的事情的书。那就是圣经。事实上，如果你查看旧约，那里有犹太教、伊斯兰教和基督教，把这三者放在一起，按照人们的传统来算，你就有了大约四分之三的人类或类似的比例。

如果你看看这一切，你会看到，他们都查看旧约，他们都说，这是神圣的。找出"我如何找到神"的唯一明智方式，至少是首先去查看圣经。当你查看圣经时，你会看到圣经说你可以找到神，不仅仅是寻找神，而是找到神。我读的这段经文，摩西找到神的经文，真的非常非常重要，因为它确实给出了所有基本原则。这里我们看到三样东西，不完全是三样东西。

实际上是同一件事，被越来越深入地观察。有燃烧的荆棘。起初，它是一个令人分心、令人不安的景象。起初，对摩西来说，它只是一个令人不安的景象。当他走近时，他看到这是一种无法驾驭的力量。

当他走得更近时，他看到中间有一位燃烧的天使。我想对你说，当你看到这三样中的每一样时，你正在

经历你必须经过的阶段才能找到神。你必须看到同样的三件事。你必须知道并经历同样的三件事。它们是什么？

我最后会总结。从现象上看，也就是当我从外部观察时，首先，我们看着它，它只是一个扰乱性的景象。它把他带离了他正常的行动路线。然后他走近一些，他看到这是一种无法掌控的力量。最后，他看到中间有一位燃烧的天使。

除非你看到这三件事，除非同样的三件事发生在你身上，否则你无法找到神。现在，让我们看看这三件事。每一件都是一个阶段。首先，首先，燃烧的荆棘是一个扰乱性的事件。现在，我所说的扰乱，请注意这里第三节和第四节说，摩西看见荆棘虽然着火，却没有烧毁。

于是他说，我要过去看看。第四节说，耶和华见他过去要看。然后他说话了。现在，"过去"这个词翻译得不是很好。这是我认为我们的翻译让我们失望的地方之一。

因为我们这里有一个非常具体的词，用了两次。更好的翻译应该是"转向一旁"。这个词在希伯来语中用来表示离开常规路径，离开正常道路，离开主干道。摩西当时在做什么？他只是在放牧他的羊群。

他在做他的事。他过着普通的生活。除非有什么东西来扰乱普通生活，否则他永远不会开始寻找神。你知道，摩西并没有说，我想今天我要寻找神。必须有什么东西扰乱他，使他转离正常的道路，因为圣经告诉我们，普通的生活让你太忙碌，这使你倾向于寻找神。

我是什么意思呢？嗯，你知道，C.S.路易斯在他的《魔鬼家书》一书中。读起来很有趣。如果你从未读过它，这是一本有趣的读物。读起来很快。

这是一本虚构的书，我希望如此。它讲的是一个资深魔鬼给他的侄子写信，他的侄子是一个初级魔鬼，仍然在试探的战场上。资深魔鬼的名字叫"螺丝胶带"。

斯克鲁泰普已经退休了，至少他现在在地狱的官僚体系中升得更高了。你知道，他正在给他的侄子提建议。

他开始告诉他的侄子，确保你的病人——他这样称呼他——永远不会落入敌人的魔掌的最佳方法之一，这个敌人当然就是耶稣。他是这样说的，他说，争论的麻烦在于它把整个斗争移到了敌人的地盘上。通过争论这个行为本身，你唤醒了病人的理性。一旦它被唤醒，谁能预见结果呢？即使某一特定的思路可以被扭曲到最后对我们有利，你也会发现，你一直在加强你的病人关注普遍问题的致命习惯。

并且从即时感官体验的流动中抽离注意力，你的任务是把他的注意力固定在那个流动上。教他称之为真实生活。不要让他问他所说的真实是什么意思。记住，他不像你。他不是纯粹的灵体。

你没有意识到这些人类是多么被日常的压力所奴役。我曾经有一个病人，一个坚定的无神论者，他常在大英博物馆阅读。有一天，当他坐着阅读时，我看到他脑海中的一连串思绪开始走向错误的方向。敌人，当然，就在他的身边。还没等我意识到，我就看到我二十年的艰苦努力开始摇摇欲坠。如果我失去理智，开始尝试用争论来辩护，我就完蛋了。

但我不是那么傻。我立即暗示，差不多是时候他该吃午饭了。敌人大概提出了反建议，你知道人们永远无法完全听到他对他们说的话，就是这比午饭更重要。至少我认为那一定是他的说法，因为当我说事实上，它太重要了，不能在早上结束时处理。

病人明显振作了起来，当我补充说最好吃完午饭后再回来，用清醒的头脑去研究它时，他已经走到门口一半了。一旦他走到街上，战斗就赢了。我让他看到一个报童在喊卖正午的报纸。我让他看到一辆73路公交车像往常一样驶过。然后

在他走到楼梯底部之前,我已经让他产生了不可改变的信念,即无论一个人独自与书为伴时脑海中会冒出什么奇怪的想法。

健康剂量的现实生活——我想他指的是公交车和报童——足以向他表明,所有那些东西根本不可能是真的。他知道自己逃过一劫,在后来的岁月里,他喜欢谈论那种对现实性的无言感知,这是我们抵御镜像逻辑的谬误的最终保障。他现在安全地待在我们父亲的家中。只要我们处于普通生活中,我们就永远不会去寻找上帝。我们只是忙碌着。

我们只是被生活推着走。感官经验阻止我们提出这样的问题:我为什么这么忙?我在做什么?这实现了什么?这一切的目的是什么?

我的生活在成就什么?这一切又意味着什么?我们从不问这些问题。我们在日常生活中太忙了。必须有什么东西让我们转身。

我们永远不会自己去做这件事。必须有什么东西来让我们转身,否则我们就被困住了。那么,是什么东西必须让我们转身呢?那必须是一丛燃烧的荆棘。他转过身去看那奇异的景象。

那么,什么是燃烧的荆棘?燃烧的荆棘是某种与你所拥有的现实模型或观点相矛盾的东西。燃烧的荆棘实际上是一颗范式炸弹。它进入你关于事物应该是什么样子的范式内部,然后将其炸毁。现在我来告诉你燃烧的荆棘是如何运作的。

燃烧的荆棘是这样运作的。如果某某事是真的,我认为它是真的,那么某些事情就不可能发生。但那些事情中的一件发生了。因此某某事不可能是真的。明白了吗?

你看,我相信某某事。如果某某事是这样,那么这个就不可能,这个永远不会发生。但这个刚刚发生了。因此某某事不可能是真的。这就是燃烧的荆棘。

你看,在这种情况下,如果你是经验主义者,如果你是那种说,"好吧,我只相信此时此地的东西,我相信一切都有自然原因。我不相信超自然的东西。我不相信神秘的东西。我只相信一切都有自然原因。"哦,

什么是燃烧的荆棘？

这是一个矛盾。因为一个荆棘要么在燃烧并且正在分解，要么是冰冷的并且完好无损，但这是一个燃烧却不被烧毁的荆棘。这意味着生命和现实中有着更多的东西。如果你没有超自然的现实观，燃烧的荆棘就是一个范式炸弹。如果这个世界就是一切，那么燃烧的荆棘就不可能发生。

燃烧的荆棘已经发生了。因此，我的观点之外必定有更多的东西。但我对现实的审视必须改变。现在，燃烧的荆棘是唯一能让我们脱离平凡生活、让我们转身思考它、专注于它、并提出重大问题的东西。看，现在燃烧的荆棘会以什么形式出现呢？

哦，我的天，很多很多形式，很多形式。让我快速给你四个例子，但它们非常重要。我的意思是，这是这个故事告诉我们的主要事情之一。你永远不会仅仅通过某一天抽象地说"我想是时候了，我35岁了，我应该去寻找上帝"就找到上帝。

那永远不会发生。你被困在平凡生活的溪流中。必须有什么东西让你转身，而这些就是让你转身的东西。让我快速举个例子。四个，第一个是一个无法解释的人可以成为燃烧的荆棘。

我最喜欢的例子之一是一位女士，这实际上在某本书里，我得去找到它，但有一位女士讲述了她如何在早期来到救赎主教会，那时救赎主教会还很小。她是一个从不太思考宗教、对宗教不感兴趣的人，但她在城里的一家电视网工作，她有一个老板。有一天，她搞砸了，她本可以轻易失去工作，但老板为她承担了责任和后果。他能够保住自己的工作，但她可能无法保住。她感到非常惊讶。

她说她有过很多会把责任推给她的老板。但她从未有过为她承担责任的老板。她简直震惊了。所以她去感谢他，但然后她继续追问。你知道，你为什么要这么做？

那真是太好了。你为什么要这么做？他

试图稍微推脱一下，说，嗯，谢谢。不，不，这只是任何人都会做的事。最后，他说，好吧，我是一个基督徒。

她说，这和它有什么关系？她说，嗯，你知道，他说，嗯，你看在其他宗教中，你知道，上帝做这做那，但在我们的宗教中，我们的上帝实际上来了并承担了责备。我的救主为我承担了责备，因此我可以为其他人承担责备。现在这是一个范式炸弹，因为在她的心目中，宗教使人成为责备者。这是她见过的唯一一种变得虔诚的人——责备者。

你从未想过有一种宗教可以把你变成一个承担责备的人。你从未见过这样的。突然间她说，也许这个宗教是不同的。也许这个人是不同的。她说，你去哪里做礼拜？

那是救赎主教会，她就开始去了。所以她有了一个模式，并且它打破了原有的认知。让我给你另一个例子。另一种燃烧的荆棘不是一个可解释的人，而是一个难以解释的思路。现在我的意思是，很多世俗的人正开始成为灵性的寻求者，因为他们开始思考成为一个世俗人士意味着什么——相信真的没有永恒。

没有超自然。没有天堂。一切都只是偶然。一切都只是物质。一切都是物质和运动。

一切都是化学、生物学和物理学。就是这样。而很多人开始说，等一下，等一下，杰克·迈尔斯在他1997年12月《纽约时报》杂志的主打文章中，整期都是关于灵性寻求的。就是那一期。它的标题是，宗教卷土重来，信仰随后而至。

你看，这个标题恰恰显示了我在开头说的。人们在寻找。但他们在寻找信仰。他们在寻找，他们饥渴，但我们还没有真正准备好去找到。但这就是他说的。这很了不起。他说，一条后现代的道路能否为有思想的人打开通往他们可以实践的宗教？如果答案是肯定的，他很谨慎。我怀疑这条道路的第一步将是

对世俗信仰丧失的宗教反思。世俗信仰的丧失。

现在听听这个。他说，一个转向宗教的男人或女人可能不是为了承认上帝或宗教的奥秘，而是为了承认他们的宗教所回应的奥秘。也就是说，即使在无法得知道德根基的情况下，也要过道德生活的那种神秘的必要性。现在，我的意思是这有点难理解。除非你读了专栏中的整段话，这就是他在说的。

他说，我们是世俗的人，因此不应该有道德这种东西。不应该有道德绝对。我的意思是，这都是见仁见智的事。没有美这种东西。这都是化学反应的问题。

没有办法说人类比岩石、树木或蝾螈更有价值，因为我们只是意外。但他说，如果我的世界观——此生就是一切——是真的，那么就不可能有人类价值这种东西。不可能有美。不可能有真正的不公正，但它们确实存在。我发现我必须过道德生活，尽管我的世俗世界观没有给我任何基础。

现在，你看到发生了什么吗？如果你愿意思考，看，这个人完全脱离了魔鬼的控制。这个人在思考，这个人不是在看73路公交车。他开始思考，他说，等一下，如果世俗主义是真的，那么就不可能有不公正。不可能有真正的爱。

不可能有美。人们真的没有价值，但他们确实有价值。这意味着几乎他看到的一切都在变成燃烧的荆棘。他回过头来说，如果我的前提导致了一个我知道不真实的结论，那么我必须回过头来检查这些前提。也许真的有上帝。

你可能知道浪子的故事，但它不仅仅是关于一个任性的小弟弟。事实上，耶稣讲这个故事是为了对那些逃离上帝的人和那些试图通过行善来赢得他的爱的人说话。在他的书《浪子的上帝》中，提姆·凯勒展示了这个众所周知的故事如何揭示福音的核心，一个充满希望的信息

对于叛逆的小儿子和论断的大儿子，以及邀请所有人体验神的浪子般的、奢侈的恩典。无论你是基督徒还是仍在探索信仰，《浪子的神》都将帮助你以全新的方式看待你与基督的关系。《浪子的神》是我们对你本月捐赠的感谢，帮助福音与生命分享基督慷慨而持续的爱所带来的希望和喜乐，传播到世界各地。

今天就在 gospelandlife.com/give 请求你的副本。就是 gospelandlife.com/give。现在，这是凯勒博士今天教导的其余部分。所以，一个无法解释的思路可以是一个燃烧的荆棘。

第三，一个无法解释的困境。现在，我的意思是，困境是我们的燃烧的荆棘。哦，天哪。这是为什么。而这对于一个有这么多年轻人的人群来说尤其相关，因为你们特别是在像纽约这样的地方。

谁会来纽约？年轻人来纽约。你们是那些锻炼的人。你们是那些成绩好的人。你们是那些真正把自己的事情安排得井井有条的人。

你们是那些来到这里并且说，我要锻炼，我要非常努力地工作的人。我有这个计划。我有那个计划。我可以掌控生活。你知道，来吧世界。

我准备好了。你有一个小小的范式。这个范式是，如果我真的、真的非常努力地工作。如果我真的很聪明，我真的很谨慎。如果我真的很精明，我就能够处理生活。

生活是可以管理的。哦，不，它不是。当某些，你知道，你把自己看得很大，生活很小，突然，困境击中你。你突然想，看到自己在现实的巨大山脉旁边是一个小小的东西。你开始意识到，困境是一个燃烧的荆棘，它粉碎了你对现实的小模式，即你有能力管理自己的生活。

你足够聪明和足够强大，能够处理正常的生活。我们大多数人都这样想，直到一个小小的，直到困境来临。你不能靠自己做到。你不能成为自己的救主。你不能成为自己的主。

这是最后一个。燃烧的荆棘可以是一个无法解释的人，可以是一个无法解释的思路，可以是一个无法解释的麻烦，但它也可以是一种无法解释的空虚。实际上，如果你上周在这里，我们讨论过这个。我们进行了一个开放论坛，讨论了成功。我引用了我最喜欢的一句话，来自辛西娅·海默尔几年前在《村声》杂志上的一篇专栏文章，她在文章中谈到，她认识很多人，他们曾经不出名，后来变得出名了。

她认识很多电影明星，在他们成名之前就认识了。她发现，在他们成名之后，他们变得极其愤怒、极其沮丧、极其狂躁、极其抑郁。这是我上周没有读的她文章的一部分。她说，我相信当上帝想对你开一个非常恶劣的玩笑时，他会满足你最深的愿望，然后在你突然意识到你想自杀时，阴险地咯咯笑。现在，你知道她为什么这么说吗？

她说，她认识的每个人，凡是实现了他们最大的梦想的人——而这样的人并不多。梦想名声的人，他们得到了；梦想财富的人，他们得到了；梦想某种成功的人，他们得到了。她说，她认识的少数几个人都发疯了，因为他们认为那肯定会让他们满足，但事实并非如此。那肯定会让他们对自己感觉良好，但事实并非如此。那肯定会让生活变得真正美好，但事实并没有。

结果，他们突然意识到，天哪，我内心有一个巨大的真空，而他们的范式——认为这就是救赎，这就是生活的意义——完全被摧毁了。成功以及随之而来的空虚，可能是所有燃烧的荆棘中最强大的。你明白吗？但你必须有一个，否则你永远找不到上帝。

它们必须进入并注意到它们几乎都是不愉快的，除非你的老板保住了你的工作。那是最好的一种。但它们往往非常不愉快。它们往往是愚蠢的、充满风暴的、强烈的。它们确实非常、非常艰难。

所以听着，当它们来临时，这就是我要说的

建议。你们这些正在寻求的人，可能这已经发生在你身上了。可能你正处于开始阶段。类似的事情进入了你的生活，而你转身过来了。很好。

你愿意转身过来吗？转身过来是什么意思？如果摩西看了看他的手表说，我得在八点前把羊群赶回家怎么办？你永远不会听说过摩西。他永远不会遇见上帝。

为什么？因为他当时在平凡的生活中。他只是在随波逐流。你必须转身过来。你必须花时间。

你必须阅读。你必须思考，你必须在某种程度上变得敞开，因为你必须和某人谈论这些事情。天啊，谁知道这会导向什么呢？你必须转身过来。你必须给它时间。

你必须。你必须腾出空间。哦，请这样做。现在，基督徒们，如果你说，这跟我没关系，是吗？当然有关系。

这就是原因。我知道你不会想听这个，但这就是事实。找到更多上帝的方式总是按照相同的原则发生的，就是你找到上帝时的那些原则。换句话说，找到更多上帝的原则就是你找到上帝的原则，这意味着如果你只是作为一个基督徒在生活的平凡溪流中随波逐流，你永远不会变得更深入，除非有什么事情进来打碎那些小范式。而我们之所以没有成长，我们之所以不更像基督，不仅仅是因为我们需要更加努力。

我们之所以不更像基督，总是因为我们对福音的理解，或对耶稣的理解，或对圣经关于上帝的教导的理解是有缺陷的。我们读它。我们以为我们理解了。哦，换句话说，普通的基督徒说，耶稣是我生命的意义。我是基督徒。我重生了。我是基督徒。耶稣是我生命的意义。然后某种职业失败来临了。你准备割喉自杀。

这意味着什么？你以为耶稣是你生命的意义。你以为耶稣是你的义，耶稣是你的荣耀和荣誉。你以为你是

因耶稣所成就的而得救，而不是因你所做的。然后这个小小的范式出现了。

我在，它把一切都炸毁了，根本不是那么回事。你以为自己在依靠上帝，然后出现了某种燃烧的荆棘。或者你以为自己理解上帝，然后突然发生了一些事情。你说，上帝绝不应该让这样的事发生。嗯，在你对上帝的看法中，这样的事永远不可能，不应该发生这样的事，但它发生了。

它发生在那里。这就是燃烧的荆棘。你明白吗？因为它在那里，这意味着你对上帝的看法是错误的。不要对上帝生气。

要意识到这是你对上帝的看法。这是你的现实模型。要找到更多关于上帝的真相，就必须用你最初找到上帝时的方式。其次，当他转过身来走进去时，他意识到上帝有话要对他说。现在很多人转过身来，开始走进去，但他们没有听到这个。

用最好的方式来表达就是：一个小小的矛盾，一个小小的矛盾总会让你进入探索模式。正是这些关于人、困难或思想轨迹等等的矛盾，但你知道自己就在真正找到上帝的门槛上的方式，是当你看到那个大矛盾时。小矛盾会引导你到一个大矛盾。这就是那个大矛盾。

除非你感受到这个，除非你与之较量过，除非这重压在你身上，否则你不会遇见真实的上帝。这个大矛盾就是：他对摩西说话，他这样说：摩西，摩西，不要再靠近了。这是一个令人难以置信的矛盾。

为什么？我来告诉你为什么。一方面，然后另一方面，首先，摩西，摩西。现在在英语中，这似乎不起作用，因为我们说摩西，摩西，好的，那是什么意思？在希伯来语中，重复一个词意味着强调。

在旧约中，有很多地方，你在读英文翻译的旧约时，会看到这样的话：大坑。他们掉进了大坑里。那不像创世记18章之类的地方。他们掉进了大

坑。但如果你实际上是用希伯来语阅读,它会说坑坑,因为在希伯来语中,表达大坑的方式就是说坑坑,明白吗?

当你重复一个专有名词时,比如当大卫不只是说押沙龙,而是说押沙龙,押沙龙,我的儿子,我的儿子,当耶稣说西门,西门,撒但想要得着你,好筛你像筛麦子一样,当耶稣说马大,马大——名字的重复意味着情感的强度,关系的深度。它总是意味着我想要与你建立关系。它总是意味着爱。它总是意味着强度。现在你开始明白这一点了吗?

当摩西走上前时,上帝说我要你更近一些。走开。摩西,摩西,不要再靠近了。等等。你明白吗?

他在说靠近一点。停下。脱掉你的鞋子。这是圣地。这是怎么回事?

一方面,他被告知我是一位圣洁的上帝。这就是为什么上帝是一位火焰之神。火意味着圣洁。火意味着公义。火意味着威严。

火意味着我就是我所是的。不是你想要我成为的样子。当摩西问你的名字是什么?上帝并没有说我的名字是我就是你想要的样子。不是。

上帝对摩西说的是我就是我所是的。你看,如果他的名字是我就是你想要的样子,那就不会是火焰,而是泥土了。你可以对他做任何你想做的事?人们不断地在这样做。他们一开始就这样说。

他们说,嗯,我只是在寻找上帝。你有你的信仰,那对你很好,它帮助了你。那对你很好。对你来说是真的。但如果我能找到一个信仰,我需要一个信仰。对我来说是真的。所以当他们问我,嗯,我对成为基督徒感兴趣,你会说现在基督徒相信这个,我的意思是如果我成为基督徒,我必须做这个和这个,我不想必须做这个,我不必做这个。现在你知道发生了什么吗?那是一个泥土之神。那不是一个火焰之神。

你寻找的是一个适合你的上帝,而不是一个让你去适应的上帝。你看,在泥土中,它被触碰者塑造,但火焰融化触碰者。我的意思是,触碰者进来触摸泥土,当然泥土会向触碰者屈服。但火焰,如果你触摸火焰,会把你变成泥土。

而神一开始就在说的是，如果你想要真正的神，你必须去寻找一位能够反驳你的神。

如果你想要真正的神，你必须去寻找一位神。你必须愿意看到一位神，他会告诉你一些你不想听的事情。当有人说，让我直说吧。当有人说，你知道，我有女朋友，我有男朋友。如果成为基督徒意味着妨碍这段关系，我就不想成为基督徒。

现在，这就是你在说的。这是一个彻底的矛盾。你在生命的洪流中，所以你没有逻辑性。让我把你拉出来。你在说的是，我甚至在认识他之前就知道我是谁。

我甚至还没有遇见神，但我知道我需要什么。我没有遇见神，但我知道性伦理是什么。我甚至还没有遇见神，但我知道我的需求是什么。如果他是创造者，你怎么能在遇见他之前就知道你是谁呢？如果有一位创造者，如果他做了这一切，这意味着你甚至无法开始寻找这位神，一位真正的神，除非你脱下你的鞋子。

你看，神没有说，我想见你，然后你可以脱下鞋子。他说，你甚至不会见到我，除非你先脱下鞋子。这意味着什么呢，你必须说，神啊，如果你存在，我愿意做一些现在我不喜欢的事情。如果你不愿意这样说，而大多数现代人都不愿意，那么你实际上在做的就是，你说我在寻找神，但你并没有在寻找神，你并没有在寻找一位真正的神，现实不是你想要的样子。难道你现在还不知道这一点吗？

现实总是它本身。你不能真正改变。我的意思是，你知道，好吧，伙计，你125磅重，五英尺六英寸高，你在锻炼，你永远不会打职业橄榄球。我不在乎。永远不会。

你可以做任何你想做的事。你就是做不到。你可能连踢球员都做不了。但肯定不会成为你一直梦想成为的后卫。现实就在那里。

而且如果有，我的意思是，如果有人来找你说，我想了解你，你说，好的。那么，我喜欢认为

你作为一个苛求的、专横的人。你说，你怎么敢？你甚至不是真的想知道我是谁。你无法仅仅通过说"我想要思考"来了解我，但看看你做了什么。

当一个人说，我不想找到一个不让我做这做那的上帝。我不想成为一个狭隘的人。而你真正在说的是，我拒绝给予上帝同样的尊重——那种我要求任何想要了解我的人所必须给予的尊重。看，除非你从一开始就脱掉你的鞋子，这意味着除非你愿意找到一个会告诉你不想听的事情、要求你做不想做的事情的上帝，否则你甚至还没有开始寻找。你不能客观地开始这场寻找。

然后希望我们会以某种方式找到上帝。你必须从一开始就说，上帝，如果你在那里，我愿意承认你可能是神圣的。你可能是火焰。现在我这样说了，你说，等一下，如果是这样的话，哦我的天，哦我的天，哦我的天，我不想要那样的上帝。但现在这同一位上帝说，退后。

我是神圣的。不要只是走进我。不要只是带着好奇心的精神随意对待。你看，表现出一些尊重，表现出一些敬意。要愿意投降才能找到我。

但他也是那个说"摩西，摩西"的人，你知道，或者在这里填入你的名字，无论你叫什么名字。他说，我要你进来。我想成为你的一部分。我想靠近。事实上，"摩西，摩西，离远点"这句话本身就是一个燃烧的荆棘。

这是一个彻底的矛盾。上帝在说的是，我想让我的神圣进入你里面。但上帝的神圣怎么能进入我呢？这伟大而庄严的事物怎么能降临到我身上呢？你看上帝是什么，你看燃烧的荆棘是什么？

燃烧的荆棘是圣经宗教核心的矛盾。那就是真正的上帝坚持说他不是真的神圣而可能有一点爱，或者不是真的有爱而可能有一点神圣，而是他绝对神圣并且他绝对有爱。他是一个燃烧的荆棘。他是另一个矛盾。而世界上所有其他人都拒绝倾听他是谁。

虔诚的人说他真的很神圣，我们可以通过

尽我们最大的努力，做好事。换句话说，你知道，他们强调圣洁而不是恩典。这就是为什么我们不喜欢他们。这也是为什么基本上他们没有一个他们真正享受的神，而是一个苦差事般的神。他们甚至没有一个他们真正能为之充满热情的神，因为他们有一个你可以控制的神。

你有一个温顺的神。如果你认为你可以凭自己的努力赚取上天堂的资格，那不是一个火热的神。那是一个非常温顺的神。你把他买通了。但另一方面，另一些人不看圣洁。

他们看爱。现代人喜欢一个只是接纳我们的神的想法，你知道，罗杰斯先生般的神，对吧？我爱你本来的样子。我只是爱你、接纳你。

那也不是一个火热的神。那是一个多愁善感的神。你不会对此充满热情。你不会对那样的神充满热情。一个说神是圣洁的，他偶尔宽恕的人。你不会对那样的神充满喜乐。

或者神说，是的，他接纳我本来的样子。他的爱没有任何代价。你不会接受。除非他同等地兼具两者，否则就没有火焰。你看到矛盾了吗？

如果你坚持要真理或爱，而不是将它们结合在一起，如果你坚持说，我相信一个真正基本上是苛求的神，或者我相信一个完全充满爱、接纳所有人的神，如果你走任何一条路，你永远看不到真正的神，因为真正的神是一个火热的神，他说，我想要与你建立爱的关系。这就是为什么耶稣说我们为你们吹笛，你们却不跳舞；我们为你们唱挽歌，你们却不哀哭。基督教要乐观得多，也悲观得多。要高尚得多，也低下得多。神说，我是圣洁的神，但我降卑下来，看，第8节，在怜悯中。

基督教在神所做的事上比任何其他宗教都要求更高，在神所做的事上也比任何其他宗教更有爱、更有恩典。没有任何其他宗教有一个如此圣洁的神说，要完全，否则你不能上天堂。神在圣经中这样说。没有任何其他宗教这样说，但另一方面，没有任何其他宗教有一个

降临下来。这就是解决之道。

那些小矛盾会把你带到神面前。而那个大矛盾会摆在你面前。不要离开它。永远不要妥协。永远不要偏离它所说的。

但解决方案是什么？那圣洁如何能进入我的生命？答案是，在燃烧的荆棘中，有一位天使。不是天使。抱歉，我说的是天使吗？

这在旧约中非常重要。每当你看到一位天使，任何人试图敬拜天使时，天使总是说，起来吧。我只是和你一样的受造物。但在旧约中，有一个非常神秘的形象，被称为耶和华的使者。第2节，耶和华的使者在火焰中向他显现。

那么，这个矛盾怎么可能被调和在一起？答案是，主通过天使说话。荆棘中有一位中保。天使在荆棘中，而主通过荆棘说话。什么？

通过中保。有这个形象，这个神秘的形象。但这位中保在火焰之中。为什么？我们知道答案。

贯穿整个旧约，神说，你能与圣洁的神同在并与我建立个人关系的方式，是如果有人替代你并承受你的惩罚。因此一次又一次地，祭物被献入神圣洁的火中。当你有罪时，你献上祭物并祈求赦免。那是一个替代。有什么被杀并放入火中。

但新约告诉我们原因。因为有一位进入其中，通过一次献祭将自己投入火中，他被焚烧，使我们不必被焚烧。因为耶稣基督被神的圣洁忿怒所焚烧，我们自己能够成为燃烧的荆棘。你知道燃烧的荆棘是什么吗？燃烧的荆棘是指有神的圣洁在我们里面的人，但它不会毁灭我们。

你知道那意味着什么吗？基督徒是充满能力、个性和内住位格的人。其次，基督徒是拥有美的人。事实上，没有比这更好的图画来描绘马丁·路德所说的

福音的，用来设定罪人的象征。同时，当你成为基督徒时，因为耶稣基督不是为了你，你同时既是公义的又是有罪的。

同时，你是美丽的，但也是一丛荆棘。你知道，不是巨大的红杉树。你知道，当你成为基督徒时，你不会变成红杉树。你会变成燃烧的荆棘。你仍然是荆棘。

你仍然是罪人。然而，你被耶稣的公义所遮盖。你被耶稣的美所充满。你知道，这就是可能发生的。而这只有可能。

你只会变成一个充满热情、燃烧之心的人。如果你不仅看到真理的神，或仅仅看到爱的神，而是看到律法被基督充满，这里是赦免的声音，将奴隶转变为儿女，将责任转变为选择。你明白吗？让那些小矛盾驱使你走向大矛盾。然后坚守在那里。

如果这是你今晚第一次听到这个，我可以告诉你这个。你可能还不明白。我说得不够清楚。没有足够的时间，但我告诉你，请转过身来。还有基督徒朋友们，认识到这一点。

如果你需要让你的荆棘再次燃烧，回去看看耶稣做了什么。回去看他在火中被焚烧。回去看，因为他被焚烧和消耗，我们可以燃烧而不被神的圣洁力量所消耗。你看到这一点的程度。你看，你看到他在荆棘中燃烧的程度，你就会成为一丛燃烧却不被消耗的荆棘。

让我们祷告。父啊，我们祈求你帮助我们应用这些事情。我们中的许多人现在正在受苦，我们只是对此感到不满。我们只是对此生气。而不是看到这是你用矛盾让我们转身，并将我们带入伟大矛盾的核心的方式，那就是律法在耶稣基督里因你的爱而得以成全。

我们祈求你用这些事情改变你的心，并通过耶稣将它们应用到我们的生活中，奉他的名祷告。阿们。
