## English Transcript / 英文原文

today's message, Tim Keller explores the human condition through stories in the Bible,  uncovering what Scripture says about sin and why it's the only explanation deep enough  to face the truth about ourselves. The teaching this morning is based on this passage in Jeremiah. I'm going to read chapter 2, and what's printed there, verses 2 to 13 and verse 19. Jeremiah is one of the last prophets that God sent to the people of Judah before their  nation and culture collapsed completely. They were invaded, they were carried away into exile, and the book of Jeremiah is a series  of sermons from God in a sense to the people through the prophet Jeremiah.

And this is the first of all the great sermons in which Jeremiah is trying to show the people  of Judah what's wrong with them, why their lives are falling apart, why their culture  is falling apart, why their psyches are falling apart, why their families are falling apart. Let me read, beginning here at the top, verse 2, I remember the devotion of your youth,  how as a bride you loved me and followed me through the desert through a land not sewn. Israel was holy to the Lord, the first fruits of his harvest, all who devoured her were  held guilty and disaster over took them, declares the Lord. Hear the word of the Lord, oh house of Jacob, all you clans of the house of Israel. This is what the Lord says.

What fault did your fathers find in me that they strayed so far from me? They followed worthless idols and became worthless themselves. They did not ask, where is the Lord who brought us up out of Egypt and led us through the  barren wilderness through a land of deserts and rifts, a land of drawed and darkness, a land  where no one travels and no one lives. I brought you into a fertile land to eat its fruit and rich produce, but you came into  filed my land and made my inheritance detestable. The priest did not ask, where is the Lord?

Those who deal with the law did not know me, the leaders rebelled against me, the prophets  prophesied by bail following worthless idols. Therefore, I bring charges against you again, declares the Lord, and I will bring charges  against your children's children. Cross over to the coast of Kittemann, look, send a catar and observe closely, see, if there  has ever been anything like this, has a nation ever changed its gods yet they are not gods  at all, but my people have exchanged their glory for worthless idols. Be appalled at this, O heavens, and shudder with great horror declares the Lord, my people  have committed two sins, they have forsaken me, the springs of living water, and have dug  their own sisters, broken sisters that cannot hold water. Your wickedness will punish you, your backsliding will repute you, consider then and realize  how evil and bitter it is for you when you forsake the Lord, your God, and have no  awe of me, declares the Lord, the Lord Almighty.

This is God's Word. Starting today, stretching on for about three months, all the way up to Easter, Easter is  about three months away, we are going to be doing a series of teachings on the subject  of sin, what it is, how it operates, what its effects are, what kinds, what types there  are, and we start this week and you will see us again next week with this first sermon  by Jeremiah to the people of Israel, because they were saying to themselves, and they were  saying they were calling out and saying, what is wrong with us, why are things falling  apart, what is wrong, you know, that is interesting that it seems like after every election  nowadays, everybody has been thrown out, new people have been brought in, and the papers  are saying, why is everybody so unhappy, what is wrong with us, and actually everybody  is saying, what is wrong, what is going on, well the people of Israel were asking that  question, and God came through and said, let me tell you what is wrong with you, and he  gives them a sermon on sin, the nature of sin, the character, the characteristics of sin,  and as we look at this, it is interesting, I feel like it is a huge sermon, it is last  37 verses, but it is really summarized in verse 19, sort of the summarization of its  in verse 19, there is several summarizations, but I am going to look at that mainly. There is three things that we learn from this passage about the nature of sin, the definition  you might say, the characteristics, the character of sin, and here is what they are, first of  all we learn from this passage and from the Lord, therefore, that sin is by essence denial,  sin is denial, look, look at the language he uses, consider then and realize how evil  and bitter it is for you, see that, consider then and realize how evil and bitter it is for  you, you know what this language is, this is intervention language, you know you have  a friend who calls you up, let's say, the wife of a friend calls you up and she says you  know for years he has been covering something up, there is a self, there is destructive  behavior in his life, he has been covering it up, he has been hiding it, but it has come  out, but he still won't see it, please come over here, tell him what he is doing, so you  go on over and you sit down and you hear the story, and how do you start to talk, what  do you say, what's your language, you say can't you see, don't you see what you are doing  to yourself, it's clear everybody else can say it, you are killing yourself, how can you  do this, you don't get it, you have to get it, you have to see, that's how you talk, that's  the language of intervention for a deluded loved one, don't you see, this is the language  that God uses on us, he assumes by this language, consider then and realize, what's that  mean, consider, you are not thinking, realize, you don't get it, you don't see what your  problem is, you don't realize what the source of the evil and bitterness of your life is, you  don't see it, you don't get it, you have to see it, this is the language of intervention,  the language of pleading, in other words, what we learn from this verse, what we learn  from this passage, what we learn from the Bible, the root of our problems is the force field  of denial that sin always entails, let me put it a couple of different ways, it is not fatal  to be a sinner, it's not being a sinner that's fatal according to the Bible, it's the  denial that you're a sinner that's fatal, I mean let's look at the at the most obvious,  it's just, you know, it's crying out and I've already in a sense alluded to the most obvious  parallel here, it's not, it's not fatal to be an alcoholic, is it plenty of alcoholics  are leading productive lives, what is fatal, it's a fatal to be an alcoholic and to deny  that you are, that's fatal, and we also know that there's something about the evil of alcoholism  which is what it is, it's an evil, there's something about the very nature of it that puts  out a force field of denial, isn't that right? Well that in a sense, that's just a metaphor,  in many ways a very small metaphor, just a dim reflection of what God is talking about  here, God is saying if there's evil and bitterness in your life and if there's not evil and  bitterness in your life, you're just very young, in other words if you have evil and bitterness  and you just wait, you know, wait, right, you know, I saw the Adam's family values last  night and, you know, there's little preppy girls looking at Wednesday and saying, why are  you dressed as if there's a funeral, why are you dressed as if someone's died and she  looks at you as just wait, well, the same idea, God says your life is evil and bitter, you  say my life isn't evil and bitter, God says just wait, when you see the evil and the bitterness  of your life, God says the root problem of our society and of humanity is that we  will not admit that we're sinners, there's nothing fatal about being sinners, God says there's  lots you can do about that, what's fatal is to deny that you are, that's why it is evil and  bitterness, because you don't consider, because you don't realize, consider that and realize,  that's the thing you've got to do, that's the thing you've got to see, if I could, if I could,  there's a force field that comes out from sin, you know, the old radio shows based on the shadow  that a character that had learned over in the east to cloud the minds of people around him so  they couldn't see him and it became a movie that nobody went to see this last summer as well,  that's the, but the whole idea is the shadow is someone who clouds people's minds, that's what  sin is, sin is the shadow, the real shadow, by its nature sin entails denial and you will not see  the extent and the magnitude, oh yes, we, of course, I'm a human being, I air, I'm flawed,  that's not to admit you're a sinner, that's not to admit you're a helpless sinner,  that there's, as, as Dorothy Sayers says, there's a radical interior dislocation in the heart  that we're way off-center, because we center on ourselves, that we're capable of tremendous evil,  I wish, if I could do it, I would make everybody read the poets and the philosophers and the great  thinkers of the end of the 19th century, both sides of the Atlantic, you know, in Europe and here,  what they said, they were getting rid of Christianity, they were getting rid of religion,  they were getting rid of what they considered superstition, and they said, oh yes, we are finally  bringing in a rational approach to government, a rational approach to poverty, a rational approach to  human beings, we've gotten rid of superstition, and we are going to see incredible things happen,  we're going to see an end, you ought to read the stuff, you're going to see an end  to poverty in the 20th century, we're going to see the end of war in the 20th century, the end  of war, they almost all said this, and now where are we? What was their problem, denial?

They, look, I mean, here are two great two terrific examples, I mean, there's just  zillions of examples, you know, the HG Wells and WHO, and I love to quote them,  you know, I hate to see the pain, but you see, years of, you know, they start off with this idea,  we're not sinners, and by the end of their lives, after years of disillusionment, and years of  brokenness, why? Because of the denial that we are sinners, filing the end there, brought  kicking and screaming to the place where the Bible could have pointed to start with, years wasted  over it. There's a lady, two people who were at the very foundation of the reconstruction  of the British Social Welfare Society, Sydney and Beatrice Webb, two great people did a lot of  good, but they got rid of Christianity in their own lives. In 1890, Beatrice Webb put in her diary,  this word, she said, I've staked everything on the essential goodness of human nature.  35 years later, in her diary, she reminded herself of what she had said in 1890, she cited that,  where she said, I've staked everything on the essential goodness of human nature, but then she said,  I realize now how permanent are the evil impulses and instincts in us, that mayor's social machinery  will never change. She had staked her whole life on the idea that social machinery will get rid  of the poverty, will get rid of the violence, will get rid of these things because we're essentially  good at the end of her life.

The one thing she decided would be the solution. She came to realize,  I now see, I now know, how permanent are the evil instincts and impulses in us. She'd given her  whole life to something. The Bible could have told her to start with, she was in denial. More recent, her guy named Ernest Becker, won the Pulitzer Prize, he was a social scientist.

He wrote two books on evil. The first book on evil was the structure, he called the structure  of evil. In that book, he says the real problem in the world, the reason we have poverty and the  reason we have war, the reason we have violence is because the privileged are oppressing everybody  else through oppressive social structures, and therefore he says its social science applied  to government will deal with evil. Right after he died, his last book was published called Escape  from Evil, and in the preface, you know what he says? He had changed completely, he says, I am now in  this book looking at humanity full in the face for the first time.

He says in my previous works, I had failed  to see how truly vicious human behavior is, and then get this quote, this is a dilemma that I have  been caught in along with many others who have been trying to keep alive the enlightenment tradition. This enormous problem to see that humanity is so evil causing now requires some third alternative  beyond bureaucratic science or despair. Do you know what he's saying? This is my whole life I figured  that bureaucratic science, which simply means social sciences apply better schools, legislation,  better regulations, better work on people, you see social science applied to bureaucracy,  that would deal with evil. Now that I see for the first time after years of facing my whole life,  I now see there's gotta be some third way because bureaucratic science won't work and we can't  just despair, what is that third way?

Consider then and realize how evil and bitter it is  when you forsake the Lord your God. In other words, what the Bible says is, what's wrong? What's wrong? Why spend your whole life in denial and at the end be pulled kicking and screaming  to the place you'll never see thinkers ever start out saying people are scumbags by the end of  their life they're saying now I realize that people are wonderful. Never happens, never.

It's always  the other way around. At the end of their lives they're saying I've based my whole, how could people be  so wicked, how could people be so evil? They've been in denial. What was the problem? What was the problem?

It's not the economy stupid. It's sin. It's sin. We gotta move on. The first point is this.

Sin by its nature entails denial of itself. Sin puts out a force field. Sin is denial that we're sinners. I'll just quickly do you believe it? Do you apply it to yourself?

Sometimes I think I'll make these  points and I gotta show you the application for example just a couple ways. For example, surely  there's some of you many many people say, I believe in the law of God in general. I think the  tank amendments are great. I really do. Most of the time.

But we can take these two things too far. If you were honest all the time in New York, you'd never make any money at all. If you were sexually pure all the time, you'd never have any fun. The moral law is pretty good  up to a time, up to a place, but you can overdo these things. Consider and realize  you are in denial as to how powerful sin is.

You cannot cut corners of the law of God. To do that  shows that you have no idea the power that's within you. You have no idea about how pernicious  and how pathological you have no idea of how deadly sin is. When you say, I can play around with  it. This is a gray area.

I don't know if it's right or wrong. It doesn't seem wrong. Who knows? What  the heck? Consider and realize.

We all tend to deny. We all tend to underestimate. Let me give you  another example. Some of you are saying and occasionally find you but most of you I don't for the  very reason. Many of you are saying, here's an area of my life in which I've got a problem.

I  know it. There's a flaw. There's a character flaw. I keep falling into it. I keep getting into it.

Maybe I should tell somebody, no, no. I'll do it myself. I'd be too embarrassed. I wouldn't  want to tell anybody else. I wouldn't want to go to anyone for counsel.

I wouldn't want to share  this with a good friend and say, please hold me accountable. No, no, no, that'd be too embarrassing. I can do it myself. Consider. Then and realize.

You're in denial. We're always in denial. We  always underestimate the power of the sin. Always do. You always think I can handle it.

One more, just one more example. There's an awful lot of folks, I think, who  are in a position where they are getting from somebody right now, criticism. It's very easy  to write it off 100% because the criticism is truly exaggerated or you can see that the  motives of the person are bad. Or you can see that there's a lot of error mixed in it. It's not  exaggerated, but much of what they're saying is wrong with you really isn't wrong.

So maybe you look at it and you say it's mainly wrong or it's exaggerated or you can, you know,  you consider the source. You know who that person is and what a mess that person is,  or you know what kind of motive that person is. But remember this. You ought to say to yourself,  if you take this seriously that sin is denial by its essence in its nature, you ought to say  continually, you know, it may be exaggerated, it may be mixed with error, it may be from a  fairly unadmirable source. But is God trying to tell me something?

Because I know by my nature,  I tend to deny the things that really are wrong with me. If you believe what I'm telling you here,  you should be the most gracious when it comes to criticism. The most open when it comes to  criticism when you get it. You should be the most willing to listen to people who have something  to tell you that's wrong with you. You should be the least defensive person.

If you take this seriously,  do you? Everywhere we look we see brokenness, wars, cruelty and heartache. We feel it in the world  around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way and what can be done about it? In his  brand new book that's releasing this month, what is wrong with the world?

Tim Keller offers a  clear and compassionate answer. Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer, Dr. Keller  shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us and how only the gospel  offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world,  struggling with your own mistakes or choices or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with  the world will help you see how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain  within each of us. This newly released book, What Is Wrong with the World, is our thanks for your gift  this month to help gospel in life share the good news of Jesus.

We said sin is a denial, but in particular, pardon me, God here  tells us what the essence of sin is, what the nub of it is, what the heart of sin is.

What is it? Well he says consider and realize how bitter, evil and bitter it is when you forsake me,  but then he tells and he tells why they forsake and have no awe of me. Now this is the essence. This is the essence of sin. If you ask somebody what you know defines sin for me and they'll say  well sins are breaking the rules, sins are breaking God's laws, if you believe in God,  sins, that's what sins are.

That's right, that's what sins are, but sin is a disposition,  it's an attitude, it's a stance, it's a posture of the heart and Paul, and here I keep saying Paul,  that's because I'm remembering other times. God in this passage says the heart of why you forsake  him, the heart of why you sin, the reason you break the rules, the essence of it all, no awe. You have no awe of me. Let me show you why this is the whole thing, this is the heart of it all. The new international version that we're reading, this translation, the NIV translation,  says you have no awe of me, but the word that's here is the word that's used throughout the Bible,  and it's been most translations, it says you have no fear of me.

Now one of the central themes of  the Bible is the fear of the Lord, and all through the Bible there's all this talk about the fear of  the Lord, and that's what God is saying, is the essence of sin. You do not have the fear of the Lord,  well what does fear mean? Now here's the problem, in the Bible the word fear is used in two different  ways, and we in our modern common use of the word only use it in one of those two ways. So first of all the Bible says there's a fear, in first John 4 it says there's a fear that  hath torment. Now what does that mean?

Well it's pretty simple. When we use the word fear we mean it  in this way. Fear is the anticipation of pain. Fear is the anticipation of pain, but look how  fear works. Fear means you suddenly get fixed on what's going to happen to you, and when you're  paralyzed by fear you might say when you're in the grip of fear you are focusing on what is coming  and everything is done in reference to it.

See if you're afraid, in other words for example  I'm not afraid of at least I'm not creeped out by insects, so if I see a spider or I see  in New York a roach or something like that wandering around I'll say oh there it is, I don't like it. Somebody else might find, maybe it's irrational, they cannot sit and read a book in a room  with a little roach running around. Why? They can't because they're afraid of it, okay? They're  creeped out by it, it appalls them, it obsesses them which means they cannot do anything without  reference to it, they can't forget it, it dominates everything they do, they can't get up and just  you know have a cup of coffee, they can't read, they can't, they must deal with that roach.

Why? That's what fear does. Fear absorbs you, it obsesses you with an object so that you cannot do  anything except with reference to it, but then the Bible talks about a different kind of fear  in Proverbs 28, 14, it says happy as the one who fears always, what? Happy as the one who fears  always. We read Jeff used it for our words of encouragement, it says in Psalm 130 verse 4  because you've forgiven my sins, I fear you, what?

And here's what's so interesting,  there is when it comes to God something the Bible calls fear, it's a positive fear, not a negative  fear, but you see why? You say, well why use the term? It's an inward awe before God, it's an inward  condition of delight in the magnitude of who he is. You say, well why call that fear? You see what  they have in common?

Positive fear does not have torment. In negative fear you're totally absorbed  in yourself. In positive fear you're blessedly free from thinking about yourself. In negative fear  you're parallels, in positive fear you're empowered, but here's what they have in common. The fear of the Lord means he is absolutely central.

You can do nothing without reference to him. No matter what you do, you say, how does this involve God? How does this affect my relationship  with God? How does this relate to God? Because you see the magnitude of who he is  and the greatness of who he is, and he is now utterly and absolutely central.

There is nothing that you can possibly do or think without reference to his glory, his greatness,  his love, his power. You see that? Now God says that's the essence of sin, that's the essence of  everything. In other words God is so wise, God is getting beneath the violations. You say,  well, you say sins are violating the law.

When you lie, when you are selfish, when you're cruel,  when you do these things, that's sin. Well, God says, but why would you ever do it? Why would you ever  disobey? Why would you ever be cruel? Why would you ever lie?

Why? And the answer is whenever you  sin in a particular way, at that point, you are holding something in more awe than you are holding  God in, something you find more wonderful than God, something more dynamic than God,  something more captivating than God, something more awesome than God. You see? And that,  at that point, is the reason why you sin. Let me apply this as we start to close up here.

Let me  apply this. Do you understand? First of all, let me apply it in a couple different ways. There's a  number of ways. First of all, do you see, therefore, that there is no way, no way, that there can be  halfway measures when it comes to God.

God says, the essence of sin is to not have me smack  center in the middle of your life, smack center in the middle of your thoughts. If you are a little  religious, if you are a little moral, if you are kind of religious, in other words, you can't have  a God at times, you can't have a God as a vitamin supplement. Years ago, a lady was teaching,  I've never forgotten what she said. A lady was teaching at a Christian conference and she said,  if the distance from the earth to the sun, that 93 million miles was just the thickness of one  sheet of paper. Do you know that the distance from the earth to the nearest star  would be a stack of paper 70 feet high?

Do you know that just the diameter of our galaxy  would be a stack of paper 310 miles high? Do you realize there's trillions and trillions and trillions  of galaxies that we know of? And do you know that if there is a creator God, that creator God holds it  all together with the word of his power? Now, she said, if he's there at all, how can you possibly  ask a person like that, a God like that into your life at times to come what he's called as an  assistant, as a way of getting you over the hump? Don't you see why sin is denial?

Sin is denial in  its essence because it's to be out of touch with reality. If there's a God at all, how can you relate  to him in any other way than with, unless you relate to him with complete and utter and unconditional  devotion? That's the reason why Paul says in Romans, I finally got one for Paul. Paul says in Romans 12  verse 1, in the Old King James, it's rendered this way, make yourself living sacrifices to God,  which is your reasonable service. Sin is irrational.

Either there's a God, but if there is a God,  we'll get to this and say, if there is a God, he must be central. He must be someone from whom you  can do nothing without reference. You have to do everything with reference to him, everything. There's never an area of your life where you can say, well, you know, you don't even think about  what would God say about that. What does God say about that?

Never. Do you understand that? Oh, your problem, the reason your life is so evil and bitter, there's no awe. Let me give you another  application, intellectually, intellectually. You know, when the Bible says that a lack of centrality  of God is not only the cause of all of our personal problems, but it's the cause of all our  intellectual problems.

In a place like Manhattan, I ought to say something about this. So many of your  students, scholars, thinkers, counselors, God says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,  is the beginning of wisdom, unless God is obsessively in the center of your intellectual scheme. If here's what's so interesting about this verse, don't you see how evil and bitter it is for you  when you forsake me? If you don't have awe before God, it's not just that you're trampling on his  glory, you're trampling on your glory. If you don't understand God, you won't understand yourself.

Stephen Gould teaches at Harvard, doesn't believe in God. As a result, he says, what everybody  has to say, who doesn't believe in God. He says, why are we here? We are here because one odd  group of fish had a peculiar anatomy that could transform into legs. We may yearn for a higher  answer, but there is none.

We cannot read meaning in life into the facts of nature. Now, here's  what he's saying. Take out God. There's no awe of God, then there's no awe before yourself. If God has no glory, you have no glory.

You're a meaningless animal. There's no higher answer to that. And you know what you're left with? You're left with a senseless life. You know why?

Because you're  left with an incredible discrepancy between how you feel and how you operate and what you must be. You must be a meaningless animal. When you're in love with somebody, you sit down and you never say  as you're kissing him or kissing her. You never say, this is just neurochemistry. There's no such  thing as love.

I'm just an animal. This is the way my brain is working. But that's the case. Unless  there's a God. If you have no awe of God, it is evil and bitter for you.

If there's no awe of God  in your thinking, there can be no wonder or awe before the idea of love. Love is nothing. It's just  neurochemistry. As soon as you think of the idea of good and bad, do you believe there's some things  that are really wrong? Have you seen things?

Have you heard of things? Have you read of things that  you say that's really wrong? Not if there's no God. That's just a social construction. That's nothing but culture.

No. Don't you see? Nothing matters. There is nothing awesome. There  is nothing wonderful unless God is wonderful.

The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. If you have no awe of me, you will have no awe of anything. You won't have any awe of yourself. The doctrine of sin, they say, is pessimistic. You're kidding me?

If you don't have the doctrine of sin,  there's despair, there's nothing else. Don't you consider and realize how evil and bitter it is  for you when you forsake me and have no awe of me? All your personal problems come because God  is not central in your life. All of our intellectual problems come because God is not central in our thinking. And here, lastly, dear friends, Christian friends, I want you to think about this.

All of your self-control problems are coming because God is not central. You say, how could that be? Well, it's pretty simple. Are you having trouble with worry? Are you having trouble with self-pity?

Are you having trouble with guilt? Whatever you're having trouble with, just see it in these terms. When you worry, you are in more in awe of the power of some factor than you are in the power of God. When you're guilty, you're more in awe of the power of your sin than you are in the magnitude of  his grace, the power of his grace. When you're in self-pity, you're more in awe of some great  benefit which you've lost than you are in his mercies.

When you are sure that everything's going  wrong in your life, you're more in awe of your own wisdom than you are of his wisdom at the moment. And therefore, do you know what you need? That's the reason why the psalmist says,  the fear of the Lord is clean. There's nothing that cleans you out like this. When you sit down,  you don't just study your Bible just to get a little knowledge.

When you come to church,  I hope you're not just coming to get wisdom. You need to see God. The fear of the Lord, awe,  you need to actually say, oh Holy Spirit, open my eyes so I see the awesomeness  because your worries are gone when you see him as more awesome than any factor in your life. Your guilt is gone when you see his grace is more awesome than any sin in your life. Your self-pity  is gone when you see his mercies is more awesome than any missing factor in your life.

Your anger is gone when you see God's wisdom is more awesome than any of your wisdom and any  of your little agendas for your life. You need more than anything else to see him. Say,  oh Holy Spirit, magnify him. Let his glory be known. You need to wrestle until you see him,  until you feel it's possible.

The Bible says you can have access to him. You need that. Whatever your problem is tonight, today, whatever your problem is this week,  whatever your problem is, it can be cleaned with the fear of the Lord. No matter how defiled your  ark can be cleaned. If you go to him and you say it has been evil and bitter for me,  I've denied you and I've denied your centrality.

Do you know what he'll say? He'll say,  of course I'll have you. Of course I'll have you. And if you don't do that,  if you come out of this saying, well, I'm so wicked and I'm so evil and I'm so bad,  that why would God have me? Here's the one thing that you're not in awe enough about,  his grace.

Up in verse 6, and over and over and over again throughout the whole passage,  he says, nobody says where is the Lord who brought us up out of Egypt? You know what he's saying? He's saying, think about me. You know why you don't obey me? You know why you don't make me central.

You don't trust my love. You don't trust my grace. He says, remember the Exodus. Think about it for a minute. Remember the fact I didn't give you the law in Egypt and then said, now if you obey that,  I'll bring you out.

I brought you out first and then I gave you the law later. I'm a God of grace. So why in the world are you afraid to make me central? I know why he says,  you feel like you'll lose your freedom. You'll lose your joy.

You see, you won't be free. You won't  have your options. If I obey and make God central, I will be limited in some way. God says,  why don't you say where is that gracious God who brought us up? Where is that gracious God  who operates by grace?

And that's the reason why here I say to you, unless you are ultimately  in awe of his grace, not just in awe, you can't say, I should stop sinning or God will get me. You should say, I should stop sinning because here's the gracious God who brought me out,  who brought me up. So if you go to him and say, my life is evil and bitter because I've been living  and denial at him a sinner and I've been living, especially in denial of your centrality and greatness. What will God say? I am the one who brought you up.

I am a gracious God. Of course, I'll take you back. I sent my son to live your life and to die your death. That's how I bring people  up out of Egypt now. That's how I bring people out without the law, but strictly through grace.

That's why I bring you up and put your sins away because Christ fulfilled the law. Consider and realize it is evil and bitter for you if you are not in awe of my grace and mercy. So, this is the solution to all your problems personally. This is the solution to our society's  problems. This is the solution.

God says, this is what's wrong with you. It's not the economy's  due, but it's sin and it's the best news I can give you. Let's pray. Father, we thank you that it's  now possible for us to know what's really been available to be known for thousands of years,  but people continually turn away from it. They continually deny it.

We realize, Father,  that we have to cut through our own force field of denial to see your greatness and your reality. We pray, Father, that you would show us your love and your grace so that we will trust ourselves  to put you first. We ask, Father, that you would show us how we can solve our individual  problems by seeking your fear and seeking your awe and seeing your awesomeness. Apply these  truths to our lives through your Holy Spirit. We ask it in Jesus name.

Amen.

#### 引言：罪的问题

在今天的信息中，Tim Keller通过圣经中的故事探索人类的境况，揭示圣经关于罪的教导，以及为什么它是唯一足够深刻的解释，能够让我们面对关于自己的真相。
今天早上的教导基于耶利米书中的这段经文。
我将阅读第二章，就是你们面前印出来的，第2到13节和第19节。
耶利米是上帝在犹大民族和文化完全崩溃之前，派给他们的最后一位先知之一。
他们被入侵，被掳到异地流亡，而耶利米书实际上是一系列上帝通过先知耶利米传达给百姓的讲道。

这是所有伟大讲道中的第一篇，在其中耶利米试图向犹大的百姓展示他们出了什么问题，为什么他们的生活正在崩溃，为什么他们的文化正在崩溃，为什么他们的心灵正在崩溃，为什么他们的家庭正在崩溃。
让我从这里第2节开始读：【耶和华如此说：你幼年的恩爱，婚姻的爱情，你怎样在旷野，在未曾耕种之地跟随我，我都记得。那时以色列归耶和华为圣，作为土产初熟的果子；凡吞吃他的必算为有罪，灾祸必临到他们。这是耶和华说的。雅各家、以色列家的各族啊，你们当听耶和华的话。耶和华如此说：

你们的列祖见我有什么不义，竟远离我，随从虚无的神，自己成为虚妄的呢？
他们也不说：那领我们从埃及地上来，引导我们经过旷野，沙漠有深坑之地，和干旱死荫、无人经过、无人居住之地的耶和华在哪里呢？
我领你们进入肥美之地，使你们得吃其中的果子和美物；但你们进入的时候就玷污我的地，使我的产业成为可憎的。
祭司都不说，耶和华在哪里呢？】

【传讲律法的都不认识我。官长违背我；先知藉巴力说预言，随从无益的神。
耶和华说：我因此必与你们争辩，也必与你们的子孙争辩。
你们且过到基提海岛去察看，打发人往基达去留心查考，看曾有这样的事没有。
岂有一国换了他的神吗？其实这不是神！但我的百姓将他们的荣耀换了那无益的神。
诸天哪，要因此惊奇，极其恐慌，甚为凄凉！这是耶和华说的。
因为我的百姓做了两件恶事，就是离弃我这活水的泉源，为自己凿出池子，是破裂不能存水的池子。
你自己的恶必惩治你；你背道的事必责备你。由此可知可见，你离弃耶和华——你的神，不存敬畏我的心，乃为恶事，为苦事。这是主——万军之耶和华说的。】

这是上帝的话。
从今天开始，一直延续到复活节，大约三个月的时间，我们将进行一系列关于罪的教导——罪是什么，它如何运作，它有什么影响，有哪些种类和类型。
我们从这周开始，下周你们还会看到，以耶利米对以色列百姓的第一篇讲道为基础，因为他们一直在对自己说，一直在呼喊说："我们到底怎么了？为什么一切都在崩溃？出了什么问题？"
你知道，有趣的是，现在似乎每次选举之后，所有人都被赶出去了，新的人被选上来，报纸都在问："为什么每个人都这么不快乐？我们到底怎么了？"实际上每个人都在问："出了什么问题？发生了什么事？"
以色列百姓也在问同样的问题，而上帝通过先知回应说："让我告诉你们，你们到底出了什么问题。"
他给了他们一篇关于罪的讲道——罪的本质，罪的特征。
当我们审视这篇讲道时，它确实是一篇宏大的讲道，有37节经文，但它的精髓其实总结在第19节中。

#### 罪即否认

从这段经文中，我们学到关于罪的本质的三件事——你可以说是定义、特征、罪的性质。以下就是它们。
首先，我们从这段经文和从主那里学到，罪本质上是否认——罪就是否认。
看看他使用的语言："由此可知可见，你离弃耶和华——你的神，不存敬畏我的心，乃为恶事，为苦事。"
你看到了吗？"可知"、"可见"——这是什么样的语言？这是干预的语言。
你知道当你有一个朋友，假设是一个朋友的妻子打电话给你说："这些年来他一直在隐瞒什么，他生活中有一种自我毁灭的行为，他一直在隐藏它，但现在暴露了，可他还是不愿承认。请你过来，告诉他他在做什么。"
于是你过去，坐下来，听完整个故事。你怎么开口？你说什么？你的措辞是什么？
你会说："你难道看不见吗？你没看到你在对自己做什么吗？这很清楚，其他人都看得见。你在毁灭自己。你怎么能这样？你不明白，你必须明白，你必须看见。"
这就是你的措辞，这是对一个被自欺蒙蔽的亲人进行干预时的语言——"你难道看不见吗？"
这正是上帝对我们使用的语言。他通过这样的措辞假定：你没有在思考，你不明白，你看不见你问题的所在，你没有意识到你生命中邪恶和苦难的根源是什么。你必须看见，你必须明白。
换句话说，我们从这节经文中学到的，从这段经文中学到的，从整本圣经中学到的，是：我们问题的根源是罪所必然带来的否认力场。
让我换几种方式来说明。成为一个罪人并不致命——按照圣经的说法，致命的是否认自己是罪人。
让我们看最明显的例子。成为一个酗酒者并不致命，对吧？很多酗酒者都在过着有成效的生活。
什么才是致命的？成为一个酗酒者却否认自己是——那才是致命的。
我们也知道，酗酒这种恶本身就有某种特性，会产生一个否认的力场，不是吗？

好吧，这在某种意义上只是一个比喻，在很多方面是一个很小的比喻，只是上帝在这里所说的一个微弱的反映。
上帝说，如果你的生活中有邪恶和苦难——而如果你的生活中没有邪恶和苦难，那只是因为你还很年轻。
换句话说，如果你有邪恶和苦难，就等着吧。
昨晚我看了《亚当斯家族的价值观》，那里面有一些小女孩穿着漂亮，看着星期三问："你为什么穿得像参加葬礼一样？你为什么穿得像有人死了一样？"星期三看着她说："等着吧。"同样的道理。
上帝说你的生活是邪恶和苦难的。你说我的生活不是邪恶和苦难的？上帝说："等着吧。"
当你看到你生命中的邪恶和苦难时，上帝说，我们社会和人类的根本问题是我们不愿承认自己是罪人。
成为罪人本身并不致命，上帝说这有很多可以做的。致命的是否认你是罪人。
这就是为什么它是邪恶和苦难的——因为你不思考，因为你不认识到。"思考并认识到"——这是你必须做的事，这是你必须看到的事。
罪就像《影子》一样——你知道那个老广播节目吗？主角在东方学会了使周围人的心智迷糊的能力，这样他们就看不见他了。这也被拍成了一部去年夏天没人去看的电影。
但整个想法是"影子"是一个能使人心智迷糊的人。这就是罪的本质——罪是真正的影子。
按其本性，罪必然带来否认，你不会看到罪的程度和规模。
哦，是的，当然，我们会说"我是人，我会犯错，我有缺陷"——但这不是承认你是罪人，不是承认你是一个无助的罪人。
正如多萝西·塞耶斯所说，在我们内心有一个根本性的内在错位，我们严重偏离了中心，因为我们以自我为中心，我们有能力做出巨大的邪恶。
我真希望能让每个人都读一读19世纪末大西洋两岸——欧洲和美国——的诗人、哲学家和伟大思想家们所写的东西。
他们正在摆脱基督教，摆脱宗教，摆脱他们认为的迷信。
他们说："哦，是的，我们终于带来了一种理性的方法来治理国家，理性的方法来处理贫困，理性的方法来对待人类。我们已经摆脱了迷信，我们将看到不可思议的事情发生。"
你应该读读那些东西——"我们将在20世纪看到贫困的终结，我们将在20世纪看到战争的终结。"他们几乎都这么说。
现在我们在哪里？他们的问题是什么？否认！

他们的问题是什么？否认！

这里有两个很好的例子——我是说，有无数个例子，H.G. 威尔斯、萧伯纳，我喜欢引用他们。
你知道，我不想看到那种痛苦，但你看，他们从这个想法开始——"我们不是罪人"——但到了他们生命的尽头，经过多年的幻灭和破碎，为什么？因为否认我们是罪人。
最终他们被踢打着拖着来到圣经一开始就能指出的地方，多年白白浪费了。
有一位女士——悉尼和碧翠丝·韦伯夫妇——是英国社会福利体系重建的奠基人。他们做了很多好事，但他们在自己的生活中摆脱了基督教。
1890年，碧翠丝·韦伯在她的日记中写道："我把一切都押在了人性本善上。"
35年后，在她的日记中，她提醒自己1890年说过的话，她引用了那句话，然后说："我现在意识到，我们内心的邪恶冲动和本能是多么持久，社会机制根本改变不了。"
她把整个人生都押在了这个想法上——社会机制会消除贫困，会消除暴力，会消除这些东西，因为我们本质上是善良的。但到了生命的尽头...

她曾以为会是解决方案的那件事，她开始意识到："我现在知道了，我现在看到了，我们内心的邪恶本能和冲动是多么持久。"
她把整个人生都献给了某件事，而圣经一开始就可以告诉她——她一直在否认中。
更近期的例子——有一个叫欧内斯特·贝克尔的人，获得了普利策奖，他是一位社会科学家。

他写了两本关于邪恶的书。第一本叫《邪恶的结构》。
在那本书中他说，世界的真正问题，我们有贫困、战争、暴力的原因，是因为特权阶层通过压迫性的社会结构压迫其他所有人，因此他说，应用于政府的社会科学将解决邪恶问题。
就在他去世后，他的最后一本书出版了，叫《逃离邪恶》。你知道他在前言中说了什么吗？
他完全改变了观点。他说："我现在在这本书中第一次正视人类。"

他说："在我以前的作品中，我未能看到人类行为是多么真正邪恶。"
然后是这句引言——他说："这是一个我和许多其他试图保持启蒙传统的人陷入的困境。看到人类如此邪恶，这个巨大的问题现在需要某种第三种选择，超越官僚科学或绝望。"
你知道他在说什么吗？他说："我一生都认为官僚科学——也就是应用于更好的学校、立法、更好的法规、更好的对人的工作的社会科学——社会科学应用于官僚机构，这会解决邪恶问题。
现在，在面对我整个人生之后，我第一次看到，必须有某种第三条路，因为官僚科学不管用，而我们又不能只是绝望。那第三条路是什么？"

"由此可知可见，你离弃耶和华——你的神，不存敬畏我的心，乃为恶事，为苦事。"
换句话说，圣经说的是：出了什么问题？出了什么问题？
为什么要花整个人生在否认中，最后被踢打着拖着来到一个地方？
你永远不会看到思想家们一开始说"人都是坏蛋"，然后到生命尽头说"现在我意识到人是美好的"。从来不会这样。

总是相反的方向。
到了生命尽头他们说："我把整个人生都建立在……人怎么能这么邪恶？人怎么能这么坏？"
他们一直在否认中。问题是什么？问题是什么？

"不是经济问题，笨蛋。是罪。是罪。"
我们必须继续。第一点是：罪按其本性必然带来对自身的否认。罪产生一个力场。罪是对我们是罪人的否认。
我快速问你：你相信这一点吗？你把它应用到自己身上吗？

有时候我提出这些观点，我必须展示它的应用，举几个例子。
比如，肯定有一些人——很多人说："我大体上相信上帝的律法。我认为十诫很好。真的。大多数时候。"

"但我们可以把这些东西做得太过。如果你在纽约一直诚实，你根本挣不到钱。如果你一直保持性纯洁，你就永远没有乐趣。"
道德律法在一定程度上是好的，但你可以做过头。
"思考并认识到"——你在否认罪有多么强大。
你不能在上帝的律法上走捷径。这样做表明你完全不知道在你里面的力量有多大。
你不知道罪有多么有害和病态，你不知道罪有多么致命。
当你说"我可以玩弄它"，"这是一个灰色地带"，"我不知道这是对是错"，"看起来不太错"，"谁知道呢"，"管它呢"——思考并认识到！
我们都倾向于否认。我们都倾向于低估。
让我给你另一个例子。你们中有些人——我偶尔会遇到，但大多数人不会，正是因为这个原因——你们中很多人在说："这是我生活中有问题的一个领域。我知道。有一个缺陷，一个性格缺陷。我不断陷入其中。"

"也许我应该告诉某个人……不，不，我自己来。那太尴尬了。我不想告诉任何人。我不想去找任何人咨询。"

"我不想把这件事分享给一个好朋友，让他监督我。不，不，不，那太尴尬了。我自己能做到。"
"思考并认识到。"
你在否认中。我们总是在否认中。我们总是低估罪的力量。总是这样。你总是认为"我能处理"。

还有一个例子。我认为有很多人现在处于这样一种状况：他们正在从某人那里受到批评。
很容易把批评百分之百地否定掉，因为批评确实是夸大的，或者你能看出那个人的动机不好。
或者你能看出其中混杂着很多错误——批评不是夸大的，但他们说你的很多问题其实并不是问题。

所以也许你看着它说"这主要是错的"或"这是夸大的"，或者你考虑来源——"你知道那个人是什么样的人，那个人有多乱"，或者你知道那个人的动机是什么。
但记住这一点：如果你认真对待罪本质上就是否认，你应该不断地对自己说："你知道，它可能是夸大的，可能混杂着错误，可能来自一个不太值得敬佩的来源。但上帝是不是在试图告诉我什么？"

因为我知道按我的本性，我倾向于否认那些真正是我问题的事情。
如果你相信我在这里告诉你的，当涉及到批评时，你应该是最有恩典的人。当你收到批评时，你应该是最开放的。
你应该最愿意倾听那些有话要告诉你、指出你问题的人。你应该是最不防御的人。

如果你认真对待这一点，你是这样吗？
我们放眼望去，到处都是破碎——战争、残忍和心碎。我们在周围的世界和我们自己的生活中感受到它。
它是怎么变成这样的？我们能做什么？
在他本月发布的全新著作《世界出了什么问题？》中...

Tim Keller给出了一个清晰而富有同情心的答案。
Keller博士从救赎主长老会的一系列教导中汲取素材，展示了罪的现实如何解释我们所见的一切痛苦，以及只有福音才能提供持久的自由和医治。
无论你是被世界的状态所压倒，与自己的错误或选择挣扎，还是在寻找希望和喜乐，《世界出了什么问题？》都将帮助你看到福音如何既回应我们世界的心痛，也回应我们每个人内心的痛苦。
这本新发布的书《世界出了什么问题？》是我们感谢你本月帮助"生命福音"分享耶稣好消息的礼物。

#### 罪的本质

罪是否认，但其次，主要的是，罪不仅仅是一般的否认。罪否认的是什么？
我们说罪是一种否认，但具体来说，上帝在这里告诉我们罪的本质是什么，它的核心是什么，罪的心是什么。

它是什么？他说："由此可知可见，你离弃耶和华……乃为恶事，为苦事。"
然后他告诉为什么他们离弃——"不存敬畏我的心"。这就是本质。这就是罪的本质。
如果你问某人"给我定义一下罪"，他们会说："罪就是违反规则，违反上帝的律法——如果你相信上帝的话。这就是罪。"

没错，这就是诸罪（sins），但罪（sin）是一种倾向，是一种态度，是一种姿态，是心的一种姿态。
我这里一直说保罗——那是因为我想起了其他时候。上帝在这段经文中说，你离弃他的核心，你犯罪的核心，你违反规则的原因，所有这一切的本质是——不敬畏。
"你对我没有敬畏。"
让我向你展示为什么这是整个事情的核心。
新国际版译本说"你对我没有敬畏"，但这里用的词是整本圣经中使用的词，在大多数译本中译为"你不敬畏我"。

圣经的中心主题之一是"敬畏耶和华"，整本圣经都在谈论敬畏耶和华，而这就是上帝所说的罪的本质——你没有敬畏耶和华。
那么"敬畏"是什么意思？这里有个问题：在圣经中，"敬畏"这个词有两种不同的用法，而我们在现代日常用语中只用其中一种。
首先，圣经说有一种"带来痛苦的惧怕"（约翰一书4章）。这是什么意思？

很简单。当我们用"惧怕"这个词时，我们是指这样的意思：惧怕是对痛苦的预期。
惧怕是对痛苦的预期，但看看惧怕是如何运作的。惧怕意味着你突然专注于将要发生在你身上的事，当你被惧怕瘫痪时，你完全聚焦于即将发生的事，一切都参照它来做。

换句话说，比如我对昆虫不害怕，至少不会被吓到。所以如果我看到一只蜘蛛，或者在纽约看到一只蟑螂在跑，我会说："哦，它在那儿。我不喜欢它。"
但有些人可能会觉得——也许是非理性的——他们无法在一个房间里坐下来读书，如果有一只小蟑螂在跑来跑去。为什么？
因为他们害怕它，它使他们厌恶，使他们困扰。这意味着他们做任何事都无法不参照它，他们无法忘记它，它主宰着他们做的一切。他们无法起来喝杯咖啡，无法阅读——他们必须处理那只蟑螂。

为什么？这就是惧怕的作用。惧怕让你被一个对象吸引、困扰，以至于除了参照它之外你什么都做不了。
但圣经又谈到另一种惧怕。箴言28:14说："常存敬畏的，便为有福。"什么？"常存敬畏的，便为有福"？
我们之前读杰夫用作勉励话语的诗篇130:4说："但在你有赦免之恩，叫人敬畏你。"什么？

这很有趣——当涉及到上帝时，圣经所说的惧怕是一种积极的惧怕，而不是消极的惧怕。
为什么？你会问："那为什么用'惧怕'这个词呢？"它是在上帝面前的一种内在敬畏，是一种对他伟大的喜悦的内在状态。
你会问："那为什么叫它惧怕呢？"你看它们有什么共同点？

积极的惧怕没有痛苦。在消极的惧怕中，你完全被自己吸引。在积极的惧怕中，你蒙福地从思考自己中解放出来。
在消极的惧怕中你被瘫痪，在积极的惧怕中你被赋能。但它们的共同点是：敬畏耶和华意味着他绝对是中心。

你做任何事都不能不参照他。无论你做什么，你都会问："这如何涉及上帝？这如何影响我与上帝的关系？这与上帝有什么关系？"
因为你看到他是谁的伟大和宏大，他现在完全、绝对地居于中心。

你不可能做或想任何事而不参照他的荣耀、他的伟大、他的爱、他的能力。你看到了吗？
上帝说这就是罪的本质，这就是一切的本质。换句话说，上帝是如此智慧，上帝在深入到这些违规行为之下。
你说："罪就是违反律法。当你说谎，当你自私，当你残忍，当你做这些事情，那就是罪。"

上帝说："但你为什么会做呢？你为什么会不顺服？你为什么会残忍？你为什么会说谎？为什么？"

答案是：每当你以某种特定方式犯罪时，在那一点上，你对某样东西的敬畏超过了对上帝的敬畏——某样你认为比上帝更美好的东西，某样比上帝更有活力的东西，某样比上帝更能吸引你的东西，某样比上帝更令人敬畏的东西。
你看到了吗？在那一点上，这就是你犯罪的原因。
#### 应用：神的中心性

让我在接近结束时应用这一点。

让我应用这一点。你明白吗？首先，让我用几种不同的方式应用它。有很多种方式。
首先，你是否看到，因此，在对待上帝的事上，没有任何折中的办法？

上帝说，罪的本质就是没有把我放在你生命的正中央，放在你思想的正中央。
如果你只是有点宗教，有点道德，有点属灵——换句话说，你不能只是有时候有一个上帝，你不能把上帝当作维生素补充剂。
多年前，有位女士在一个基督教会议上讲道，我从未忘记她说的话。她说："如果从地球到太阳的距离——9300万英里——只是一张纸的厚度，你知道从地球到最近的恒星的距离会是多少吗？是70英尺高的一摞纸。"

"你知道仅仅我们银河系的直径会是多少吗？是310英里高的一摞纸。你意识到我们已知的星系有数万亿个吗？你知道如果有一位创造主上帝，这位创造主上帝用他能力的话语托住这一切吗？"
然后她说："如果他真的存在，你怎么可能只是在需要的时候请这样一位上帝进入你的生活，让他作为一个帮手，作为一种帮你度过难关的方式？"
你难道看不出为什么罪就是否认吗？

罪本质上就是否认，因为它是与现实脱节的。如果真有一位上帝，你怎么可能以任何其他方式与他建立关系，除非你以完全、彻底、无条件的委身与他建立关系？
这就是为什么保罗在罗马书12:1中说——终于提到保罗了——保罗在钦定本中是这样表达的："将自己作为活祭献给上帝，这是你们理所当然的事奉。"
罪是非理性的。

要么有一位上帝，但如果有一位上帝，他必须是中心。他必须是一位你做任何事都不能不参照的那位。
你做一切都必须参照他。永远没有你生活中的一个领域可以说："好吧，你知道，上帝对此会怎么说？上帝对此怎么说？"
永远不能。你明白这一点吗？"哦，你的问题，你的生活如此邪恶和苦难的原因，是因为你不敬畏。"
让我给你另一个应用——在知识层面。

当圣经说上帝不居于中心不仅是我们所有个人问题的原因，也是我们所有知识问题的原因时，在像曼哈顿这样的地方，我应该谈谈这个。
你们中很多人是学生、学者、思想家、顾问。上帝说"敬畏耶和华是智慧的开端"——是智慧的开端。除非上帝痴迷地居于你知识体系的中心……
这节经文很有趣，你难道看不出离弃上帝对你来说是多么邪恶和苦难吗？
如果你对上帝没有敬畏，这不仅仅是你践踏了他的荣耀——你也践踏了你自己的荣耀。如果你不理解上帝，你就不会理解你自己。

斯蒂芬·古尔德在哈佛大学教书，他不相信上帝。结果他说了每个不相信上帝的人都必须说的话。
他说："我们为什么在这里？我们在这里是因为一群奇怪的鱼有一种特殊的解剖结构，可以转变成腿。我们可能渴望一个更高的答案，但没有。"

"我们无法从自然的事实中读出生命的意义。"
你看他在说什么？把上帝拿掉。对上帝没有敬畏，那么对你自己也就没有敬畏。如果上帝没有荣耀，你也就没有荣耀。

你只是一个无意义的动物。没有比这更高的答案了。你知道这会留给你什么吗？你会剩下一个毫无意义的人生。为什么？

因为你会留下一个不可思议的矛盾——你的感受和你的运作方式与你必然是什么之间的矛盾。
你必然是一个无意义的动物。当你爱上某人时，你坐下来，你永远不会在亲吻他或她时说："这只是神经化学反应。没有所谓的爱。"

"我只是一个动物。这只是我大脑的运作方式。"但如果没有上帝，那就是事实。
如果你对上帝没有敬畏，对你来说就是邪恶和苦难的。

如果你的思想中对上帝没有敬畏，你对爱的概念就不会有惊奇或敬畏。爱什么都不是。它只是神经化学反应。
一想到善与恶的概念——你相信有些事情真的是错的吗？你见过、听过、读过那些让你说"那真的是错的"的事情吗？

如果没有上帝，那就不是。那只是社会建构。那只是文化。
不。你难道看不出吗？没有什么是重要的。没有什么是令人敬畏的。没有什么是美好的——除非上帝是美好的。

敬畏耶和华是智慧的开端。如果你对我没有敬畏，你对任何事物都不会有敬畏。你不会对你自己有敬畏。
他们说罪的教义是悲观的。你在开玩笑吗？如果你没有罪的教义，就只有绝望，没有别的。

"你难道不思考并认识到，当你离弃耶和华你的神，不敬畏我时，对你来说是多么邪恶、多么苦吗？"
你所有的个人问题都是因为上帝不居于你生命的中心。我们所有的知识问题都是因为上帝不居于我们思想的中心。
最后，亲爱的朋友们，基督徒朋友们，我要你们思考这一点：你们所有的自我控制问题都是因为上帝不居于中心。
你会说："怎么会呢？"很简单。你在与忧虑斗争吗？你在与自怜斗争吗？

你在与罪疚感斗争吗？无论你在与什么斗争，只要从这个角度来看。
当你忧虑时，你对某个因素的能力比对上帝的能力更加敬畏。
当你有罪疚感时，你对你的罪的力量比对他恩典的伟大、他恩典的能力更加敬畏。
当你自怜时，你对你失去的某个巨大好处比对他的怜悯更加敬畏。

当你确信你的生活一切都在变糟时，你此刻对你自己的智慧比对他的智慧更加敬畏。
因此，你知道你需要什么吗？这就是为什么诗人说："敬畏耶和华是清洁的。"没有什么比这更能洁净你了。
当你坐下来，你不只是研读圣经来获得一点知识。

当你来教会时，我希望你不只是来获取智慧。你需要看到上帝。
敬畏耶和华——敬畏——你需要真正地说："哦，圣灵啊，打开我的眼睛，让我看到你的可畏。"
因为当你看到他比你生命中的任何因素都更可畏时，你的忧虑就消失了。
当你看到他的恩典比你生命中的任何罪都更可畏时，你的罪疚感就消失了。
当你看到他的怜悯比你生命中任何缺失的因素都更可畏时，你的自怜就消失了。

当你看到上帝的智慧比你自己的智慧、比你对人生的任何小计划都更可畏时，你的愤怒就消失了。
你最需要的是看到他。说："哦，圣灵啊，放大他。让他的荣耀被知晓。"
你需要摔跤直到你看到他，直到你感受到。这是可能的。

圣经说你可以接近他。你需要这个。
无论你今晚、今天、这周的问题是什么，无论你的问题是什么，它都可以用敬畏耶和华来洁净。
无论你的心有多么被玷污，它都可以被洁净。
如果你去他那里说："这对我来说一直是邪恶和苦难的，我否认了你，我否认了你的中心地位。"

你知道他会说什么吗？他会说："当然我会接纳你。当然我会接纳你。"
如果你不这样做，如果你走出这里说："好吧，我太邪恶了，我太坏了，我太糟了，上帝为什么会接纳我？"
——这里有一件事是你对他的恩典还不够敬畏。

在第6节，以及整段经文中反复出现，他说："没有人说：'那领我们从埃及地上来的耶和华在哪里呢？'"
你知道他在说什么吗？他在说："想想我。你知道你为什么不顺服我吗？你知道你为什么不把我当作中心吗？你不信任我的爱。你不信任我的恩典。"

他说："记住出埃及。想想看。记住我没有在埃及先给你律法然后说，'现在如果你顺服这些，我就把你带出来。'"

"我先把你带出来，然后才给你律法。我是一位恩典的上帝。那么你为什么害怕把我当作中心呢？"
"我知道为什么——你觉得你会失去自由，你会失去快乐。你看，你不会自由了。你不会有选择了。如果我顺服并把上帝当作中心，我会在某种程度上受到限制。"

上帝说："为什么你不说'那位把我们带上来的恩典的上帝在哪里？'那位按恩典运作的恩典的上帝在哪里？"

这就是为什么我在这里对你说：除非你最终敬畏他的恩典——不只是敬畏——你不能说"我应该停止犯罪，否则上帝会惩罚我。"
你应该说："我应该停止犯罪，因为这是那位把我带出来、把我带上来的恩典的上帝。"
所以如果你去他那里说："我的生活是邪恶和苦难的，因为我一直活在否认中，否认自己是罪人，我特别否认你的中心地位和伟大。"
上帝会说什么？"我是那位把你带上来的那一位。"

"我是一位恩典的上帝。当然，我会把你带回来。我差遣我的儿子来过你的生活，死你的死。这就是我现在如何把人从埃及带出来。这就是我如何不靠律法，而纯粹靠恩典把人带出来。"

"这就是我如何把你带上来，除去你的罪，因为基督成全了律法。"
"思考并认识到，如果你不敬畏我的恩典和怜悯，对你来说是邪恶和苦难的。"

#### 结论：解决方案

所以，这是你所有个人问题的解决方案。这是我们社会问题的解决方案。这就是解决方案。

上帝说："这就是你的问题所在。不是经济问题，笨蛋。是罪。"
这是我能给你的最好消息。
让我们祷告。

天父，我们感谢你，现在我们可以知道那些数千年来一直可以被知道的东西，但人们不断地转离它。他们不断地否认它。
我们意识到，父啊，我们必须突破我们自己否认的力场，才能看到你的伟大和真实。
我们祈求，父啊，你会向我们展示你的爱和恩典，以便我们信任自己，把你放在首位。
我们请求，父啊，你会向我们展示如何通过寻求对你的敬畏、看到你的伟大，来解决我们个人的问题。
通过你的圣灵将这些真理应用到我们的生活中。
我们奉耶稣的名求。阿门。
