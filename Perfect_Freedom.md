## English Transcript / 英文原文

Today, Tim Keller explores how lasting change actually happens in the life of a Christian  and why the Gospel offers a radically different process of transformation than anything  else. The Scripture is from Romans chapter 6. What shall we say then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? By no means.

We died to sin. How can we live in it any longer? Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into  his death. We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death and order that just as Christ  was raised in the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may have a new life. If we have been united with him like this in his death, we will certainly also be united  with him in his resurrection.

But we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done  away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin because anyone who has died has been  freed from sin in the same way count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus. Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. Do not offer the parts of your body to sin as instruments of wickedness but rather offer  yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life and offer the parts  of your body to him as instruments of righteousness. For sin shall not be your master because you are not under law but under grace. But then shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace?

By no means, don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone to obey him as slaves,  you are slaves to the one whom you obey whether you are slaves to sin which leads to death  or to obedience which leads to righteousness. But thanks be to God that though you used to be slaves to sin you hoardedly obey the  form of teaching to which you were entrusted. You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness. This is God's word. We just completed a series on why and how to believe in Jesus.

And now I'd like to do a short series on how if you believe in Jesus, that faith actually  changes you. What is the process by which change really happens? If you need to see changes in your life, how does that flow from belief in Jesus? When I first embraced faith which would be late college, right after college, I had  a number of things in my life that needed profound change. And nothing seemed to work until two Christian writers, one from the 16th century, excuse  me John Owen, and one from the 20th century John Stott, I just really met, both directed  me in their writings to Romans chapter 6, 7 and 8.

Paul there, more fully than any other place in his writings or the Bible, lays out how  faith in Christ concretely leads to changes, what the process really consists of. It's more succinctly put by the way in Colossians 3 but it's most fully put in Romans 6, 7  and 8. And that's what we're going to look at. I'm going to take you there. It's like kind of going home for me in a way and I take you there over the next brief  handful of weeks.

And the whole chapter, chapter 6, 7 and 8, that whole section revolves around the question  that you heard posed twice, both in verse 1 and 15, you heard it read. And the question arises from Paul's teaching about the gospel, in chapters 1 through 5  of Romans, he lays out the gospel. And the gospel has a theme in it that's unique to all the world religions and all the  philosophies of the world. That is, that salvation is received, it's not achieved. It's received not on the basis of your merit or your goodness or anything in you at all.

That's radical. And whenever you hear that form of teaching, whenever that gospel teaching is laid out,  immediately and inevitably at first hearing anyway, the question arises, wait a minute. If that's the case, if salvation is surely by grace is nothing to do with how you live,  not live any way you want, why would you want to change? Why would this kind of message change you at all, it seems to me, somebody might say,  that this message would leave you exactly the way you were? Paul answers that question.

See, if you understand the gospel, why would you change? How do you change? Why would you want to change? Paul answers that. And in the process, he gives us three principles, in my experience and my pastoral work with  people over the years, and in my understanding, studying in the Bible, are absolutely crucial.

Three keys, three secrets, three principles, I don't know, I really want you to listen  to them. Three keys to real profound life change, and here's what they are. You have to recognize the shape of your spiritual slavery. You have to realize the scope of your cosmic unity with Jesus. And you have to live daily out of your new identity.

Recognize your spiritual slavery, the shape of it. Realize the breadth and scope of your cosmic unity with Jesus. And live daily out of your new identity. Slavery, unity identity. Let's look at these three things.

And by the way, if you're done with the sermon, you say, I really need more detail. This is the introduction to a series to be continued. Come back. All right, so if I preach this well, I won't preach this well. I won't preach this fully because it's an introduction.

First of all, this passage tells us you have to recognize your spiritual slavery. And I'm looking at verse 15 and 16. And 15 and 16, Paul says, especially 16, after saying, what? Shall we send that grace may abound, that we're not under a law but under grace? No, he says, don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone to obey him as slaves,  you are slaves to the one whom you obey.

Whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience,  which leads to righteousness. Now, the first half of verse 16 isn't as shocking to the original readers as it seems to us. The reason why it seems somewhat shocking to us, when he says, offer yourselves as slaves,  is because when we read what the Bible says about slavery, we read it through,  I mentioned this a couple of weeks ago, right, we read it through the filter  of our own experience of new world slavery and we think of slavery as race-based and for life. But in the first century, if you were facing a lifelong debt, an enormous debt,  and you didn't want to be saddled with it the rest of your life,  it wasn't uncommon for a person to actually sell themselves to a particular person  for a period of time, for five years, for 10 years, in order to work off the debt,  you know, as fast as possible. And therefore, you offer yourself into bond service, you offer yourself into slavery.

But Paul says, the problem is that you're getting something which, of course, is getting rid of the debt. That person is now your master. That person has complete control over your life. Now that wasn't that surprising to the original readers. But the second half, after the dash, was.

Because Paul proceeds then to bring this into the spiritual realm and he says, don't you realize  that there's only two categories of people in the world. People who are obeying God and are in absolute unconditional service to God  or people who are spiritually slaves to something else. And there's no other category, there's no third category, there's nothing in the middle. There's no alternative to that, those two. What Paul's doing is he's booting off of the first commandment of the 10 commandments.

And in that first commandment, Paul, God says, I am the Lord God. I must be your God. Don't make anything else your God. But notice the first commandment only says there's two things, two categories. You either make God, God, or you make something else your God.

But there is no third possibility, there's no alternative. You must, if you don't worship the true God, make something else a God in your life. Even if it's small G, even if it's small case G, there's no one without a God. Now, how can that be, you say, well, think. And this is what Paul's, this is his case.

Everybody lives for something, what do I mean by that? Well, to live for something means everybody has a something that is your main way of significance  and your main way of security, your main way to feel valuable,  or like your life is worth anything, or that you have any significance. And there's always something that is the main way that you face the difficulties and dangers of life. Something is the main way, regardless of what your doctrinal beliefs are about, religion, and so on. Something is the main way that you get significance in the main way you get security.

And that could be a career or family or achievement. It could be personal independence or the need to have people dependent on you. It could be power and influence or human approval. It could be a political cause. It could be money.

It could be romance. It could be physical attractiveness. It could be any number of things, but here's what Paul is saying. You're going to live for something. There's going to be something that basically makes your life feel like it's meaningful.

It makes you feel like you're worthwhile. But he says, here's what you don't seem to know. Whatever that is, is a spiritual master. It's controlling you. You think it's doing something for you, and it is doing something for you.

But you have offered yourself to it. You've offered yourself. You've given yourself. You're under its control. You're being controlled by it.

It's a spiritual master. How so? The answer would be. And Paul's answer, and those of you who've been around me for a while,  or heard this teaching before, no, there's always a... Whenever I'm talking about this subject, there's a Greek verb somewhere nearby,  the same Greek verb, and here it is.

It's in verse 12. He says, do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. Don't let sin reign. See, there's spiritual masters. You're going to be a slave to something.

And whatever it is that you have given yourself to, whatever you've offered yourself to,  is controlling you through, quote, evil desires. Now, let's be real sympathetic to the translators. There's a Greek word here that is very hard to translate. In the Old King James Bible, it was usually translated lust to the flesh. The trouble is that that's actually literally not a bad translation.

For you and me today, lust to the flesh means sex, and this isn't talking about sexuality. And it doesn't actually say. There's the word thumia in it,  and that means desires or drive. But the prefix to the word is epithumia, which means an overdrive or an over-desire. This is not talking about desire for bad things.

It's talking about an ordinate desire for good things. And that is how you lose control. There's good things in your life that you've made into ultimate things, and they control your  life, because if they really are, your means of significance. So they really are. You mean security.

You've got to have them. You've got to have them. And therefore, they control you through an ordinate desires. Let me give you three tests. Let me give you three kinds of epi desires, three kinds of an ordinate desires.

That will show you where your spiritual masters are. The first one would be anger. If something blocks you're getting a good thing, you get angry. But if something blocks you getting an ultimate thing, something you've based your life on,  you get epi angry. You lose it.

You say things you afterwards. I don't know why I said that. You blow up, or you get incredibly bitter. Are you having trouble forgiving anybody? Are you having trouble forgiving somebody at the root of it  is a spiritual master that's controlling you through an over desire for something?

Wait a minute. So you start to say, wow, this really starts to make me rethink my life. That's the point. Let me give you a second test. Fear.

If something good is threatened, something good in your life is threatened. You're worried. But if something ultimate in your life is threatened, you're paralyzed with fear. Absolutely fall apart. You can't control your anxiety.

Are you so anxious that you can't think straight? It's something that so makes you afraid that you know you're being driven by it. It's because some spiritual master, something, is enslaving you. And it's controlling you. It's directing you, or a third test, of course, would be sadness.

If you lose something good, you grieve, you weep, it's terrible. It takes months to get over it. If you lose something that's ultimate, you want to throw yourself off a bridge. You want to throw yourself off a bridge. You don't feel there's no meaning in life.

Martin Luther, in his larger catechism,  brilliant piece of work, expounds the first commandment. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. And in his exposition, he points out that the first commandment is the basis for all the other  commandments. He says, you never do anything else wrong in your life. You never do anything else wrong.

You don't get over angry, over afraid, or over despondent. You don't lie, you don't kill, you don't steal, you don't do anything else wrong. Unless first, you're committing this sin. Something you've set up as an idol in your life, and that's the reason for everything  that happens in your life. It's the underlying factor in everything.

If you have an eating disorder, you've offered yourself to the god of thinness. At some deep level, your heart is said, if I have thinness,  if I look like that, then I'll be okay. If you're a workaholic, if you overwork, and you know you're overwork,  you've made a covenant as you've offered yourself to the god of money or status or achievement. There's very many different ways for that. If you're in a relationship, and you know, and everybody knows, it's really a bad relationship.

But you can't give it up. You can't give it up. You've made an idol out of male or female affection. You just can't imagine not being with somebody. These things got you, and here's what Paul is saying.

Everybody in the world has got spiritual masters. No one in the world is free. You think you're in control. You think you're your own person, and you're not. And until you get rid of that illusion,  you'll never make the changes that you need to make in your life.

And so you see his first answer to the question. When a person says, well, you know, if it's all by grace and you know,  why do gods will? Why not do my own will? He says, if you say, why not live any way I want? You are comically.

You are fatally naive about how the human heart works. If you're not doing gods will, if you're not given wholly to him,  you're absolutely out of control. And everyone's shape is different. Everyone's spiritual masters are different. So the first step in any kind of major change is to understand yourself,  and you have to recognize the shape of your particular spiritual service.

Number one, number two. Secondly, and two and three go together, but secondly,  if you're going to get the resources that Christ gives you to change,  you have to realize the scope and the breadth of the cosmic unity you have with him. The heart of this passage, this chapter in these whole three chapters,  are in these verses up here, verse three to five. Don't you know that all of us who are baptized into Christ,  Jesus who are baptized into his death in verse five,  if we've been united with him in his death,  we will certainly also be united with him in his resurrection. Now, first of all, who's he talking about?

He's talking about the baptized, and what does that mean? And it's just his way of saying that converted. Who are the baptized? These are the people who have given their lives to Christ. Baptism is sort of like the wedding ring.

It's one thing to fall in love to somebody. It's another thing to give your life to the person. It's one thing to be in love. It's another thing to commit yourself, and that's the ring that's baptism. And so when he talks about baptism,  he's not talking about super Christians,  or he's talking about everybody who's really given their lives to Jesus.

What is true of these people? Verse five, they are united. We are united to him. And that word united is a strange word, actually. It's a horticultural word, and it means that we've been engrafted into the root.

The root. Not engrafted up here, even though there's other places in the Bible that talk about that. The metaphor is trying to say that our life has been inserted into the very roots of his life. What does that mean? Well, look at verse five,  we have been united to the past and the future of Jesus Christ.

Jesus past is now our past. Jesus future is not our future. That's what it's saying. I have a whole series to unpack this, but just give me a couple minutes right now. First of all, it says, we died in him.

Our past is his past. What's that mean? Remember, I mentioned that Colossians three is another place where Paul goes into this,  even more succinctly, and in Colossians three,  he says, you have been raised with Christ,  where Christ is seated at the right hand of God, set your mind on things above. For you died and your life is now hid with Christ in God. You died in him, you're raised in him, you're seated at the right hand of God in him.

What's that mean? Here's what it means. Imagine a person who has become rich, and how did he or she become rich? Here she became rich through the brilliance and the diligence of effort. So, riches came to this person through the brilliance and diligence of effort,  their efforts.

But now they get married. How does all those riches come to the new spouse? Through legal union by grace. The one person has done everything in order to bring all this wealth,  bring all this wealth and mass this wealth. But the second person just gets married.

Legal union by grace, like that. This is telling you this, why is Jesus Christ at the right hand of the Father? That's a place of honor. That's where you put the prime minister. That's where you put the returning conquering general.

You know why he's at the right hand of the Father? Look at what he's accomplished. Look at his life. Look at the nobility and the goodness and the greatness and the courage of what he's done. And the Father looks at the Son and his heart literally bursts with delight.

And this text is saying that everything Jesus Christ has done is now legally true of you. The determining factor in your relationship with God is no longer your past but Christ's past. And the Father dotes on you and accepts you and delights in you and sees you  as having all the beauty and the greatness and the glory of his Son. He sees you as a free from condemnation for the guilt of your sins as if you had died yourself  and already paid the penalty for all your sins. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God.

Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365 day devotional, the Songs of Jesus, you'll find daily readings  through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a regular devotional practice,  this book is a wonderful way to start. And if you already spend time in study and prayer,  then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest emotions and questions  before God and discover a new level of intimacy with him. We'll send you Tim and Kathy Keller's  devotional is our thanks for your gift to help gospel and life share the love of Jesus with more  people.

That's the first thing where United Christ passed but notice in verse five it also says  we will certainly be united in his resurrection. See that certainly it doesn't say conditional. Now if you really live a good life and you come to church and you come to Redeemer and take notes  on Tim and Keller's servants, you certainly will be you know it doesn't say anything like that. It says you you certainly period.

What that means is there's an indesoluble connection. The moment  you believe with the future of Jesus Christ you are already connected to him. What does this mean? Well  there's a there's a fascinating Greek word that shows up twice in the Bible. It's a philosophical  term and it's a term that's the name of the term is Palingenesia.

You hear the word Genesis  in there and it actually means the rebirth of the cosmos, the rebirth of the cosmos. And it came from stoic philosophy that believed that of course history was an endless cycle  and that the world would get worse and worse and worse and and there would be decay and  it would be brokenness and every so often the stoics believed there would be a purging  and a great fire would come and cleanse everything and purify everything and take away the old  and make everything new and fresh again and history was saw all over. That was the view of the  stoics. Endlessly enlist cyclical Palingenesia's birth and rebirth and rebirth and rebirth. Oh, what do we believe as Christians?

Here's what we believe. In Matthew chapter 1928, Jesus Christ  takes that word and deliberately uses it in the most startling and astonishing way. He says in 1928  he says at the Palingenesia and it's usually translated at the renewal of all things. When the  son of man sits on his glorious throne everyone who has lost houses or brothers or sisters or  fathers or mothers or children or fields for my sake will receive 100 times as much an eternal life  for many who are first will be last and the last will be first. Jesus says there will be a  Palingenesia but one the there is a single point at which all of history toward which all of history  is flowing at which everything sat will become untrue.

Everything will be purged. Everything will  become new and everything will dance and everything will be in fullness and wholeness. And what fire  is strong enough? What power is life giving enough to do such a thing? And the answer is when Jesus  Christ puts forth his royal power when this is when the son of man sits on his glorious throne in  the future.

The entire world is going to be purged. Everything will be reborn. Cosmic rebirth,  everything sat will come untrue. History itself will be changed. Isn't that amazing?

I'll tell you what's more amazing. That word shows up one more time in the Bible and an even more  surprising place. In Titus chapter 3 verse 5, Paul is talking about our salvation, our personal  salvation. And he says, Jesus saved us not because of righteous things we have done,  but through the washing of rebirth through the Holy Spirit. Do you know what that word rebirth is?

It's the word Palingenesia. And it's totally inappropriate, at least at first glance. Because Palingenesia is talking about cosmic rebirth, not personal renewal,  but do you know what Paul is saying? Paul is saying, the minute you become a Christian,  the Holy Spirit comes into your life, we understand, right? But now do you understand what this is saying?

The power of the future, the power of that future transcendent order, that absolute ultimate  life giving power that someday going to regenerate the entire cosmos comes into your life and begins  to work now. And therefore, when we say, if it's all of grace, why live a good life? Paul says,  you have a slightest idea what's happened to you, have you? He didn't just get a get out of jail  free card, you didn't just get a pardon? You were united to everything in Christ past and everything  in Christ's future.

And you know what this means? You know, when you and I come, in fact me too,  when I came to Christ, when you come to Christ, when anybody comes to Christ, we come with  the most unbelievably small ambitions, we want inner peace. We want a little reorientation,  we want a little pickup, we want, you know, to feel like our life matters, you know,  we want some inspiration, you know. But boy, boy, there's a lot more to it than that. For  Kathy and me, this passage out of mere Christianity by C.S.

Lewis has been a life shaping,  quote, listen, Lewis says, imagine yourself as a house. God comes into rebuild it. At first,  you can understand what he's doing, getting the drains right, stopping the leaks and the roof,  and so on. You know those jobs needed doing and so you were not surprised. But presently,  he starts knocking the house about in a way that hurts abominably and does not seem to make sense.

What on earth is he up to? The answer is he is throwing out a new wing here,  putting on an extra floor there, running up towers, making court yards. You thought you were  going to be made into a decent little cottage. But he is building a palace. He intends to come and  live in it himself.

If we let him, he will make the feeblest and filthiest of us into a dazzling,  radiant immortal creatures pulsating all through with such energy and joy and wisdom and love  as we cannot now imagine. A bright, stainless mirror which reflects back to God perfectly,  though of course on a smaller scale, his own boundless power and delight and goodness. The process will be long and in parts painful, but that is what we are in for. Nothing less. If becoming a Christian means union with Christ, I suggest two things.

Get rid of your low goals. Get rid of all your goals. Get rid of your low goals and get rid of your  your goals. Get rid of your low goals. Instead of saying, what I am trying to say is people so  often say, well, if I become a Christian, what I have to stop doing that, will I still be able to do  that?

Anticipate that you will not be able to anticipate the magnitude of the changes that when  they begin to come, you will be so grateful for. But they are way beyond anything that you could  ever dare ask or think. Nor, when you are getting started, is your mind open enough and alive enough  and that, frankly, spiritually smart enough to know what it is you need. So first of all, you have to  recognize the shape of your spiritual slavery. Secondly, you have to begin to grasp the scope and  the breadth of your cosmic unity with him.

But lastly, you must, and here is the secret, you must live  daily out of your new identity. You must live daily out of your new identity. And two verses  that tell you about that, right here, verse six, we know that our old self was crucified with him so  that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin. Our old self, that's your former self, your old identity, crucified. It's a past tense.

It's  perfect. It's done. Your old self, your former self is gone. When you become a Christian, you're  not the same person. So your old identity is gone.

You've got a new identity. So that, and it's out  of this identity that the body of sin might be done away with. Now, that doesn't mean your body,  your physical body is sinful. What it's trying to say is your body under the reign of your spiritual  masters. Do you see the rest of the sentence?

It means your life, your actions, your body is the  thing that Paul is using it as a way of talking about the way you actually live in the world, your  actions, your decisions. Through your new identity, you have the ability to break the reign of your old  spiritual masters in how you actually live. That's what verse six is saying. But in verse 11 says,  though, the identity is the secret. Look at verse 11.

It doesn't happen automatically. In the same  way, count yourselves dead to sin. You are dead to sin. You are alive to God, but you've got to  treat yourself as dead to sin and life to God. You've got to remind yourself of who you are.

In  verse 12 says, therefore, do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey. It's evil  desires. And that simply means this. On the one hand, if you're not changing in the ways you  need to change, you don't lack any resources if you're a Christian. You got them all.

You got  everything you need. On the other hand, they need to be deployed and they don't happen automatically. If you ever fail to live as you should, if you ever fail to change, you're not remembering who you  really are. You're not conscious of who you really are. You've forgotten who you are in Jesus.

That's the point. That's the key. And let me close with three questions, which of course I'll  unravel over the next few weeks. Because as soon as you hear that, here's three questions. How does  that work?

Why does it take so long? And why is that so hard? How does it work? Now, some of you  know that one of my favorite examples of this is Augustin. Santa Augustin, to put it mildly,  before he was a Christian, had a problem with sexual self-control.

But after he became a Christian  one day, he was walking along and one of his old mistresses showed up. And she came after him. She was one of the people he was particularly attracted to. And she wanted to pull them off into a  fling, which those days would last for several weeks. And so she starts to try to invite him  up to her place and attack and attract and attach to him.

And he says very kindly and very nicely  and very courteously. Thank you very much. Thank you. That's great. Thank you.

Glad to see you. But  no, no, thank you. And it starts to walk away. And suddenly it occurs to her. Maybe he didn't really  recognize me.

And she turned to him and said, Augustin, it is I. Augustin turned around and smiled  and said, yes, I know. But it is not I. See, she said, it's me, Augustin. And he said, yeah, I know.

But it's not me. What's that mean? Here's what he was saying. I used to be a person that had to  have female affection. That's the reason I was in relationships, whether no matter how destructive  they were to you or to me, they were never about love.

They were about me and about using you to  get to to fill the black hole which never was filled. I used to be a kind of person that had to have. I was driven, say, it was a spiritual master. But I have a new master. And when I think of what,  to the degree I think of who I am in him and what he thinks of me, I don't need this.

I am free  to love. I don't need anymore the same things I used to need. That's what he's saying. And you know,  you can fill in the blank. This is how you change.

You can say I used to be the kind of person  that crumbled under criticism because I had to have always perfect approval. I used to be a kind  of person that couldn't break up. But now I'm free to do what's really best for me and that other  person. I'm someone else in Jesus. That's how it works.

Okay. So okay, second question. Why is it to take so long then? Because let's be honest about the fact that there's an awful lot  of people who have received Jesus and they've brought them, you know, and they got this new identity. They understand this.

And yet the years go by and the years go by and they're not changing. Or should I  say, we're not changing. You're not changing. Why does it take so long? Dr.

David Martin Lloyd-Jones  who in his 50s and 60s preached in London preached all long series on Romans chapter 6. And  that the heart of his series to understand what Romans 6 is talking about, he used an illustration. It's a fascinating illustration. He says, imagine a country in which one group of people has for  centuries enslaved to another group of people. And that's not very hard for Americans to imagine  that.

Even though the illustration doesn't completely fit. Listen. So imagine a place where one  group has enslaved for centuries another group. And therefore, whenever a member of the enslaved  group would in the street meet a member of the oppressing group, the member of the oppressing  group could order that other person around to do anything. And if the person didn't obey,  the member of the oppressing group could have in beaten or killed.

Had the right, had the power,  could do it. But then, a good king comes into power. And he decrees emancipation for all the  slaves. And he sets up his soldiers and he sets up his police in every town and puts his judges  in his place. And they're free.

But the illustration goes on, do you think that's all it takes? It says the reality is that whenever a member of the enslaved group haven't been enslaved all  their lives haven't been enslaved for centuries. Whenever a member of the enslaved group would meet a  member of the oppressing group, they would tremble and quake. And when the members of the  impressing group would still order around the members of the enslaved group and tell them what to  do and say, go here and go there. They did it.

They did it. Now, the member of the oppressing  group didn't have the power really to do that anymore. And if they'd stood up, they couldn't have  done a thing. And yet over and over and over again, the member of the enslaved group continued to  act like slaves because though their status had changed, really changed. The reality really changed.

They were truly free. They hadn't grasped it. They hadn't realized it. They couldn't live  according to it. They remained as slaves.

And Lloyd Jones said, he ends his illustration by  saying every Christian in this room is in that condition. It's the only reason you do anything  wrong is the only reason you cannot change is the only reason you are still all wrapped up and  absorbed in, you know, epi fears and epi anger and epi discouragement all the time. And while you  can't break your habits, you don't know who you are. You've got a real status change. It's really  there.

It's not just in your mind. It's not just symbolic. It really happened. And yet you don't  know who you are. That's why it takes so long.

It took long for that group. It's going to take  long for us. You say, well, I know. But you know what? I've even heard that illustration because  I've been here for 15 years.

And I've heard you even say that. And I'm still not sure that I'm  still not changing like I should. One more question. One more answer. In verse 17, it says, you were slaves  as soon.

But thanks be to God, you wholeheartedly obeyed the form of teaching to which you were  interested. Now, the form of teaching is the first part of Romans. It's the gospel. And it says,  you used to be slaves of sin, but the gospel set your heart on fire. And in the end, going through  a little set of steps with a counselor or with a pastor is still not really the secret.

And here's  why. Years ago, in the beginning of time, according to the Bible, the serpent said to Adam and Eve,  if you utterly offer yourself to God, if you do whatever he says unconditionally, if you obey him  completely, he will abuse you. And you see, all of us sons of Adam and daughters of Eve have had  that lie come down into our hearts. It's still there. We believe, see, it says, offer yourself to  God.

And there's a part of our heart that say he will abuse us like all the other masters. See, when we're living for career, or we're living for love, or we're living for these things,  we don't feel like we're enslaved. But when the idea of giving ourselves to God, offering ourselves  to God, unconditionally, we have to do whatever he says, anything in the Bible we have to say it,  we have no more freedom. That feels terrible. And so we say, I can't do it.

I can't do it. We're  afraid to do it. And so we live in our kind of illusion of independence. We're actually in  slaves instead of going into what looks to us like slavery, which is actually the freedom of service  to God. How are we going to break that?

And the answer is, the gospel, what Jesus did, has to  inflame the heart. I recently read an essay about a movie, which I haven't seen, but I'd like to  rent now that I read the essay. It was a movie about Vietnam right after the Vietnamese war,  you know, like in the 70s. And it's a movie called Three Seasons. And it's got four vignettes in it.

And one of them is about a cyclodriver named Hai, H-A-I. And the cyclodriver is a bicycle  rickshaw. And he's poor, impoverished. And he loves Lawn, L-A-N, a prostitute, a beautiful  prostitute. Now both Hai and Lawn have completely unfulfilled desires because Hai can't afford Lawn.

And Lawn, as a prostitute, is trying to sleep her way out of the life she hates. She hates the  life of poverty. She hates the dirty life she's in. And she longs to be able to go to the clean,  beautiful life of the people who live in those elegant hotels where she has to come and do tricks for  her customers, but she has to leave because she's never allowed to stay overnight. And she dreams  of someday leaving the world of poverty and getting into that world, the world of the hotel,  the world of the people who are able to live there.

But it's not working because the more she  gives herself to prostitution in order to get out of her poverty, the more she's being brutalized,  the more she's being enslaved. But then Hai enters a cyclod race and to his surprise wins the grand  prize. And now he's got a bunch of money. And because he's got a bunch of money, maybe his  life can change, but guess what he does? He blows it all on one thing.

He rents a room in this  elegant hotel overnight and he pays lawns fee. And so I want to see you in that room tonight. All the money. Okay, well, he's going to get his harsh desire, right? And so everybody, all the  viewers are expecting this steamy cinematic love scene.

Of course, it's after all. It's a Sundance  Film Festival movie. There's going to be a lot of sex in it. So we're all expecting it and lawns  expecting it too. But then to everybody's shock, they get there and he says, I don't want to have sex  with you.

And here's how the essay goes. This is what he actually says. He has only purchased her a  place as an actual guest in the normal world she dreams of joining. And he asks only permission to  watch her fall asleep in it. Slowly, comfortably, she falls asleep and he's gone by the morning.

Having demanded nothing from her except the chance to fulfill her desire to belong. But something snaps in her. She finds she can't go back to her whole job of prostitution. Having experienced for the first time someone who used his power to serve her rather than use her,  she gets a new sense of her own dignity. She's not the same person.

She's changed by the transforming  grace of selfless love. Now, Jesus Christ had all the power in the world. And he looks down at us and he sees us trapped in the things that we think are going to free us,  but they're enslaving us. And what does he do? Philippians 2 says he emptied himself and became a servant.

Mark chapter 1045 says, I came not to be served. He says, but to serve and give my life a ransom for many. John chapter 13 says he took off his outer garment and he girded himself as a servant in order to  wash her feet. And what does this mean? He laid aside the infinities and the immensities of his being  and he purchased not just at the cost of money, but at the cost of his life.

A room in the only place there are hearts can rest his father's house. He denied himself to love us and if Lawn was transformed by the knowledge of his selfless love,  how much more will we be able to say like a gustan to all the spiritual masters and all the  spiritual mistresses out there? It's not me. Now, why wouldn't you want to offer yourself to the  only master in the universe who's offered himself for you? He's offered himself absolutely utterly.

Trust him then. Your career, give yourself to your career, careers never going to die for you. Your career is never going to offer itself for you. If you don't fulfill its dictates,  it will punish you all of your life. Give yourself to him.

Give yourself to the one master who became  a servant and you'll know what Thomas Kramer in the old prayer book said that his service alone  is perfect freedom. Let's pray. We thank you father for this overview of how we can change  and what true freedom is and we ask that you would help us to apply it to our hearts  with your Holy Spirit and we ask it through Jesus and His name we pray. Amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

Today, Tim Keller explores how lasting change actually happens in the life of a Christian  and why the Gospel offers a radically different process of transformation than anything  else. The Scripture is from Romans chapter 6. What shall we say then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? By no means.

We died to sin. How can we live in it any longer? Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into  his death. We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death and order that just as Christ  was raised in the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may have a new life. If we have been united with him like this in his death, we will certainly also be united  with him in his resurrection.

But we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done  away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin because anyone who has died has been  freed from sin in the same way count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus. Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. Do not offer the parts of your body to sin as instruments of wickedness but rather offer  yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life and offer the parts  of your body to him as instruments of righteousness. For sin shall not be your master because you are not under law but under grace. But then shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace?

By no means, don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone to obey him as slaves,  you are slaves to the one whom you obey whether you are slaves to sin which leads to death  or to obedience which leads to righteousness. But thanks be to God that though you used to be slaves to sin you hoardedly obey the  form of teaching to which you were entrusted. You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness. This is God's word. We just completed a series on why and how to believe in Jesus.

And now I'd like to do a short series on how if you believe in Jesus, that faith actually  changes you. What is the process by which change really happens? If you need to see changes in your life, how does that flow from belief in Jesus? When I first embraced faith which would be late college, right after college, I had  a number of things in my life that needed profound change. And nothing seemed to work until two Christian writers, one from the 16th century, excuse  me John Owen, and one from the 20th century John Stott, I just really met, both directed  me in their writings to Romans chapter 6, 7 and 8.

Paul there, more fully than any other place in his writings or the Bible, lays out how  faith in Christ concretely leads to changes, what the process really consists of. It's more succinctly put by the way in Colossians 3 but it's most fully put in Romans 6, 7  and 8. And that's what we're going to look at. I'm going to take you there. It's like kind of going home for me in a way and I take you there over the next brief  handful of weeks.

And the whole chapter, chapter 6, 7 and 8, that whole section revolves around the question  that you heard posed twice, both in verse 1 and 15, you heard it read. And the question arises from Paul's teaching about the gospel, in chapters 1 through 5  of Romans, he lays out the gospel. And the gospel has a theme in it that's unique to all the world religions and all the  philosophies of the world. That is, that salvation is received, it's not achieved. It's received not on the basis of your merit or your goodness or anything in you at all.

That's radical. And whenever you hear that form of teaching, whenever that gospel teaching is laid out,  immediately and inevitably at first hearing anyway, the question arises, wait a minute. If that's the case, if salvation is surely by grace is nothing to do with how you live,  not live any way you want, why would you want to change? Why would this kind of message change you at all, it seems to me, somebody might say,  that this message would leave you exactly the way you were? Paul answers that question.

See, if you understand the gospel, why would you change? How do you change? Why would you want to change? Paul answers that. And in the process, he gives us three principles, in my experience and my pastoral work with  people over the years, and in my understanding, studying in the Bible, are absolutely crucial.

Three keys, three secrets, three principles, I don't know, I really want you to listen  to them. Three keys to real profound life change, and here's what they are. You have to recognize the shape of your spiritual slavery. You have to realize the scope of your cosmic unity with Jesus. And you have to live daily out of your new identity.

Recognize your spiritual slavery, the shape of it. Realize the breadth and scope of your cosmic unity with Jesus. And live daily out of your new identity. Slavery, unity identity. Let's look at these three things.

And by the way, if you're done with the sermon, you say, I really need more detail. This is the introduction to a series to be continued. Come back. All right, so if I preach this well, I won't preach this well. I won't preach this fully because it's an introduction.

First of all, this passage tells us you have to recognize your spiritual slavery. And I'm looking at verse 15 and 16. And 15 and 16, Paul says, especially 16, after saying, what? Shall we send that grace may abound, that we're not under a law but under grace? No, he says, don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone to obey him as slaves,  you are slaves to the one whom you obey.

Whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience,  which leads to righteousness. Now, the first half of verse 16 isn't as shocking to the original readers as it seems to us. The reason why it seems somewhat shocking to us, when he says, offer yourselves as slaves,  is because when we read what the Bible says about slavery, we read it through,  I mentioned this a couple of weeks ago, right, we read it through the filter  of our own experience of new world slavery and we think of slavery as race-based and for life. But in the first century, if you were facing a lifelong debt, an enormous debt,  and you didn't want to be saddled with it the rest of your life,  it wasn't uncommon for a person to actually sell themselves to a particular person  for a period of time, for five years, for 10 years, in order to work off the debt,  you know, as fast as possible. And therefore, you offer yourself into bond service, you offer yourself into slavery.

But Paul says, the problem is that you're getting something which, of course, is getting rid of the debt. That person is now your master. That person has complete control over your life. Now that wasn't that surprising to the original readers. But the second half, after the dash, was.

Because Paul proceeds then to bring this into the spiritual realm and he says, don't you realize  that there's only two categories of people in the world. People who are obeying God and are in absolute unconditional service to God  or people who are spiritually slaves to something else. And there's no other category, there's no third category, there's nothing in the middle. There's no alternative to that, those two. What Paul's doing is he's booting off of the first commandment of the 10 commandments.

And in that first commandment, Paul, God says, I am the Lord God. I must be your God. Don't make anything else your God. But notice the first commandment only says there's two things, two categories. You either make God, God, or you make something else your God.

But there is no third possibility, there's no alternative. You must, if you don't worship the true God, make something else a God in your life. Even if it's small G, even if it's small case G, there's no one without a God. Now, how can that be, you say, well, think. And this is what Paul's, this is his case.

Everybody lives for something, what do I mean by that? Well, to live for something means everybody has a something that is your main way of significance  and your main way of security, your main way to feel valuable,  or like your life is worth anything, or that you have any significance. And there's always something that is the main way that you face the difficulties and dangers of life. Something is the main way, regardless of what your doctrinal beliefs are about, religion, and so on. Something is the main way that you get significance in the main way you get security.

And that could be a career or family or achievement. It could be personal independence or the need to have people dependent on you. It could be power and influence or human approval. It could be a political cause. It could be money.

It could be romance. It could be physical attractiveness. It could be any number of things, but here's what Paul is saying. You're going to live for something. There's going to be something that basically makes your life feel like it's meaningful.

It makes you feel like you're worthwhile. But he says, here's what you don't seem to know. Whatever that is, is a spiritual master. It's controlling you. You think it's doing something for you, and it is doing something for you.

But you have offered yourself to it. You've offered yourself. You've given yourself. You're under its control. You're being controlled by it.

It's a spiritual master. How so? The answer would be. And Paul's answer, and those of you who've been around me for a while,  or heard this teaching before, no, there's always a... Whenever I'm talking about this subject, there's a Greek verb somewhere nearby,  the same Greek verb, and here it is.

It's in verse 12. He says, do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. Don't let sin reign. See, there's spiritual masters. You're going to be a slave to something.

And whatever it is that you have given yourself to, whatever you've offered yourself to,  is controlling you through, quote, evil desires. Now, let's be real sympathetic to the translators. There's a Greek word here that is very hard to translate. In the Old King James Bible, it was usually translated lust to the flesh. The trouble is that that's actually literally not a bad translation.

For you and me today, lust to the flesh means sex, and this isn't talking about sexuality. And it doesn't actually say. There's the word thumia in it,  and that means desires or drive. But the prefix to the word is epithumia, which means an overdrive or an over-desire. This is not talking about desire for bad things.

It's talking about an ordinate desire for good things. And that is how you lose control. There's good things in your life that you've made into ultimate things, and they control your  life, because if they really are, your means of significance. So they really are. You mean security.

You've got to have them. You've got to have them. And therefore, they control you through an ordinate desires. Let me give you three tests. Let me give you three kinds of epi desires, three kinds of an ordinate desires.

That will show you where your spiritual masters are. The first one would be anger. If something blocks you're getting a good thing, you get angry. But if something blocks you getting an ultimate thing, something you've based your life on,  you get epi angry. You lose it.

You say things you afterwards. I don't know why I said that. You blow up, or you get incredibly bitter. Are you having trouble forgiving anybody? Are you having trouble forgiving somebody at the root of it  is a spiritual master that's controlling you through an over desire for something?

Wait a minute. So you start to say, wow, this really starts to make me rethink my life. That's the point. Let me give you a second test. Fear.

If something good is threatened, something good in your life is threatened. You're worried. But if something ultimate in your life is threatened, you're paralyzed with fear. Absolutely fall apart. You can't control your anxiety.

Are you so anxious that you can't think straight? It's something that so makes you afraid that you know you're being driven by it. It's because some spiritual master, something, is enslaving you. And it's controlling you. It's directing you, or a third test, of course, would be sadness.

If you lose something good, you grieve, you weep, it's terrible. It takes months to get over it. If you lose something that's ultimate, you want to throw yourself off a bridge. You want to throw yourself off a bridge. You don't feel there's no meaning in life.

Martin Luther, in his larger catechism,  brilliant piece of work, expounds the first commandment. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. And in his exposition, he points out that the first commandment is the basis for all the other  commandments. He says, you never do anything else wrong in your life. You never do anything else wrong.

You don't get over angry, over afraid, or over despondent. You don't lie, you don't kill, you don't steal, you don't do anything else wrong. Unless first, you're committing this sin. Something you've set up as an idol in your life, and that's the reason for everything  that happens in your life. It's the underlying factor in everything.

If you have an eating disorder, you've offered yourself to the god of thinness. At some deep level, your heart is said, if I have thinness,  if I look like that, then I'll be okay. If you're a workaholic, if you overwork, and you know you're overwork,  you've made a covenant as you've offered yourself to the god of money or status or achievement. There's very many different ways for that. If you're in a relationship, and you know, and everybody knows, it's really a bad relationship.

But you can't give it up. You can't give it up. You've made an idol out of male or female affection. You just can't imagine not being with somebody. These things got you, and here's what Paul is saying.

Everybody in the world has got spiritual masters. No one in the world is free. You think you're in control. You think you're your own person, and you're not. And until you get rid of that illusion,  you'll never make the changes that you need to make in your life.

And so you see his first answer to the question. When a person says, well, you know, if it's all by grace and you know,  why do gods will? Why not do my own will? He says, if you say, why not live any way I want? You are comically.

You are fatally naive about how the human heart works. If you're not doing gods will, if you're not given wholly to him,  you're absolutely out of control. And everyone's shape is different. Everyone's spiritual masters are different. So the first step in any kind of major change is to understand yourself,  and you have to recognize the shape of your particular spiritual service.

Number one, number two. Secondly, and two and three go together, but secondly,  if you're going to get the resources that Christ gives you to change,  you have to realize the scope and the breadth of the cosmic unity you have with him. The heart of this passage, this chapter in these whole three chapters,  are in these verses up here, verse three to five. Don't you know that all of us who are baptized into Christ,  Jesus who are baptized into his death in verse five,  if we've been united with him in his death,  we will certainly also be united with him in his resurrection. Now, first of all, who's he talking about?

He's talking about the baptized, and what does that mean? And it's just his way of saying that converted. Who are the baptized? These are the people who have given their lives to Christ. Baptism is sort of like the wedding ring.

It's one thing to fall in love to somebody. It's another thing to give your life to the person. It's one thing to be in love. It's another thing to commit yourself, and that's the ring that's baptism. And so when he talks about baptism,  he's not talking about super Christians,  or he's talking about everybody who's really given their lives to Jesus.

What is true of these people? Verse five, they are united. We are united to him. And that word united is a strange word, actually. It's a horticultural word, and it means that we've been engrafted into the root.

The root. Not engrafted up here, even though there's other places in the Bible that talk about that. The metaphor is trying to say that our life has been inserted into the very roots of his life. What does that mean? Well, look at verse five,  we have been united to the past and the future of Jesus Christ.

Jesus past is now our past. Jesus future is not our future. That's what it's saying. I have a whole series to unpack this, but just give me a couple minutes right now. First of all, it says, we died in him.

Our past is his past. What's that mean? Remember, I mentioned that Colossians three is another place where Paul goes into this,  even more succinctly, and in Colossians three,  he says, you have been raised with Christ,  where Christ is seated at the right hand of God, set your mind on things above. For you died and your life is now hid with Christ in God. You died in him, you're raised in him, you're seated at the right hand of God in him.

What's that mean? Here's what it means. Imagine a person who has become rich, and how did he or she become rich? Here she became rich through the brilliance and the diligence of effort. So, riches came to this person through the brilliance and diligence of effort,  their efforts.

But now they get married. How does all those riches come to the new spouse? Through legal union by grace. The one person has done everything in order to bring all this wealth,  bring all this wealth and mass this wealth. But the second person just gets married.

Legal union by grace, like that. This is telling you this, why is Jesus Christ at the right hand of the Father? That's a place of honor. That's where you put the prime minister. That's where you put the returning conquering general.

You know why he's at the right hand of the Father? Look at what he's accomplished. Look at his life. Look at the nobility and the goodness and the greatness and the courage of what he's done. And the Father looks at the Son and his heart literally bursts with delight.

And this text is saying that everything Jesus Christ has done is now legally true of you. The determining factor in your relationship with God is no longer your past but Christ's past. And the Father dotes on you and accepts you and delights in you and sees you  as having all the beauty and the greatness and the glory of his Son. He sees you as a free from condemnation for the guilt of your sins as if you had died yourself  and already paid the penalty for all your sins. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God.

Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365 day devotional, the Songs of Jesus, you'll find daily readings  through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a regular devotional practice,  this book is a wonderful way to start. And if you already spend time in study and prayer,  then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest emotions and questions  before God and discover a new level of intimacy with him.

That's the first thing where United Christ passed but notice in verse five it also says  we will certainly be united in his resurrection. See that certainly it doesn't say conditional. Now if you really live a good life and you come to church and you come to Redeemer and take notes  on Tim and Keller's servants, you certainly will be you know it doesn't say anything like that. It says you you certainly period.

What that means is there's an indesoluble connection. The moment  you believe with the future of Jesus Christ you are already connected to him. What does this mean? Well  there's a there's a fascinating Greek word that shows up twice in the Bible. It's a philosophical  term and it's a term that's the name of the term is Palingenesia.

You hear the word Genesis  in there and it actually means the rebirth of the cosmos, the rebirth of the cosmos. And it came from stoic philosophy that believed that of course history was an endless cycle  and that the world would get worse and worse and worse and and there would be decay and  it would be brokenness and every so often the stoics believed there would be a purging  and a great fire would come and cleanse everything and purify everything and take away the old  and make everything new and fresh again and history was saw all over. That was the view of the  stoics. Endlessly enlist cyclical Palingenesia's birth and rebirth and rebirth and rebirth. Oh, what do we believe as Christians?

Here's what we believe. In Matthew chapter 1928, Jesus Christ  takes that word and deliberately uses it in the most startling and astonishing way. He says in 1928  he says at the Palingenesia and it's usually translated at the renewal of all things. When the  son of man sits on his glorious throne everyone who has lost houses or brothers or sisters or  fathers or mothers or children or fields for my sake will receive 100 times as much an eternal life  for many who are first will be last and the last will be first. Jesus says there will be a  Palingenesia but one the there is a single point at which all of history toward which all of history  is flowing at which everything sat will become untrue.

Everything will be purged. Everything will  become new and everything will dance and everything will be in fullness and wholeness. And what fire  is strong enough? What power is life giving enough to do such a thing? And the answer is when Jesus  Christ puts forth his royal power when this is when the son of man sits on his glorious throne in  the future.

The entire world is going to be purged. Everything will be reborn. Cosmic rebirth,  everything sat will come untrue. History itself will be changed. Isn't that amazing?

I'll tell you what's more amazing. That word shows up one more time in the Bible and an even more  surprising place. In Titus chapter 3 verse 5, Paul is talking about our salvation, our personal  salvation. And he says, Jesus saved us not because of righteous things we have done,  but through the washing of rebirth through the Holy Spirit. Do you know what that word rebirth is?

It's the word Palingenesia. And it's totally inappropriate, at least at first glance. Because Palingenesia is talking about cosmic rebirth, not personal renewal,  but do you know what Paul is saying? Paul is saying, the minute you become a Christian,  the Holy Spirit comes into your life, we understand, right? But now do you understand what this is saying?

The power of the future, the power of that future transcendent order, that absolute ultimate  life giving power that someday going to regenerate the entire cosmos comes into your life and begins  to work now. And therefore, when we say, if it's all of grace, why live a good life? Paul says,  you have a slightest idea what's happened to you, have you? He didn't just get a get out of jail  free card, you didn't just get a pardon? You were united to everything in Christ past and everything  in Christ's future.

And you know what this means? You know, when you and I come, in fact me too,  when I came to Christ, when you come to Christ, when anybody comes to Christ, we come with  the most unbelievably small ambitions, we want inner peace. We want a little reorientation,  we want a little pickup, we want, you know, to feel like our life matters, you know,  we want some inspiration, you know. But boy, boy, there's a lot more to it than that. For  Kathy and me, this passage out of mere Christianity by C.S.

Lewis has been a life shaping,  quote, listen, Lewis says, imagine yourself as a house. God comes into rebuild it. At first,  you can understand what he's doing, getting the drains right, stopping the leaks and the roof,  and so on. You know those jobs needed doing and so you were not surprised. But presently,  he starts knocking the house about in a way that hurts abominably and does not seem to make sense.

What on earth is he up to? The answer is he is throwing out a new wing here,  putting on an extra floor there, running up towers, making court yards. You thought you were  going to be made into a decent little cottage. But he is building a palace. He intends to come and  live in it himself.

If we let him, he will make the feeblest and filthiest of us into a dazzling,  radiant immortal creatures pulsating all through with such energy and joy and wisdom and love  as we cannot now imagine. A bright, stainless mirror which reflects back to God perfectly,  though of course on a smaller scale, his own boundless power and delight and goodness. The process will be long and in parts painful, but that is what we are in for. Nothing less. If becoming a Christian means union with Christ, I suggest two things.

Get rid of your low goals. Get rid of all your goals. Get rid of your low goals and get rid of your  your goals. Get rid of your low goals. Instead of saying, what I am trying to say is people so  often say, well, if I become a Christian, what I have to stop doing that, will I still be able to do  that?

Anticipate that you will not be able to anticipate the magnitude of the changes that when  they begin to come, you will be so grateful for. But they are way beyond anything that you could  ever dare ask or think. Nor, when you are getting started, is your mind open enough and alive enough  and that, frankly, spiritually smart enough to know what it is you need. So first of all, you have to  recognize the shape of your spiritual slavery. Secondly, you have to begin to grasp the scope and  the breadth of your cosmic unity with him.

But lastly, you must, and here is the secret, you must live  daily out of your new identity. You must live daily out of your new identity. And two verses  that tell you about that, right here, verse six, we know that our old self was crucified with him so  that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin. Our old self, that's your former self, your old identity, crucified. It's a past tense.

It's  perfect. It's done. Your old self, your former self is gone. When you become a Christian, you're  not the same person. So your old identity is gone.

You've got a new identity. So that, and it's out  of this identity that the body of sin might be done away with. Now, that doesn't mean your body,  your physical body is sinful. What it's trying to say is your body under the reign of your spiritual  masters. Do you see the rest of the sentence?

It means your life, your actions, your body is the  thing that Paul is using it as a way of talking about the way you actually live in the world, your  actions, your decisions. Through your new identity, you have the ability to break the reign of your old  spiritual masters in how you actually live. That's what verse six is saying. But in verse 11 says,  though, the identity is the secret. Look at verse 11.

It doesn't happen automatically. In the same  way, count yourselves dead to sin. You are dead to sin. You are alive to God, but you've got to  treat yourself as dead to sin and life to God. You've got to remind yourself of who you are.

In  verse 12 says, therefore, do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey. It's evil  desires. And that simply means this. On the one hand, if you're not changing in the ways you  need to change, you don't lack any resources if you're a Christian. You got them all.

You got  everything you need. On the other hand, they need to be deployed and they don't happen automatically. If you ever fail to live as you should, if you ever fail to change, you're not remembering who you  really are. You're not conscious of who you really are. You've forgotten who you are in Jesus.

That's the point. That's the key. And let me close with three questions, which of course I'll  unravel over the next few weeks. Because as soon as you hear that, here's three questions. How does  that work?

Why does it take so long? And why is that so hard? How does it work? Now, some of you  know that one of my favorite examples of this is Augustin. Santa Augustin, to put it mildly,  before he was a Christian, had a problem with sexual self-control.

But after he became a Christian  one day, he was walking along and one of his old mistresses showed up. And she came after him. She was one of the people he was particularly attracted to. And she wanted to pull them off into a  fling, which those days would last for several weeks. And so she starts to try to invite him  up to her place and attack and attract and attach to him.

And he says very kindly and very nicely  and very courteously. Thank you very much. Thank you. That's great. Thank you.

Glad to see you. But  no, no, thank you. And it starts to walk away. And suddenly it occurs to her. Maybe he didn't really  recognize me.

And she turned to him and said, Augustin, it is I. Augustin turned around and smiled  and said, yes, I know. But it is not I. See, she said, it's me, Augustin. And he said, yeah, I know.

But it's not me. What's that mean? Here's what he was saying. I used to be a person that had to  have female affection. That's the reason I was in relationships, whether no matter how destructive  they were to you or to me, they were never about love.

They were about me and about using you to  get to to fill the black hole which never was filled. I used to be a kind of person that had to have. I was driven, say, it was a spiritual master. But I have a new master. And when I think of what,  to the degree I think of who I am in him and what he thinks of me, I don't need this.

I am free  to love. I don't need anymore the same things I used to need. That's what he's saying. And you know,  you can fill in the blank. This is how you change.

You can say I used to be the kind of person  that crumbled under criticism because I had to have always perfect approval. I used to be a kind  of person that couldn't break up. But now I'm free to do what's really best for me and that other  person. I'm someone else in Jesus. That's how it works.

Okay. So okay, second question. Why is it to take so long then? Because let's be honest about the fact that there's an awful lot  of people who have received Jesus and they've brought them, you know, and they got this new identity. They understand this.

And yet the years go by and the years go by and they're not changing. Or should I  say, we're not changing. You're not changing. Why does it take so long? Dr.

David Martin Lloyd-Jones  who in his 50s and 60s preached in London preached all long series on Romans chapter 6. And  that the heart of his series to understand what Romans 6 is talking about, he used an illustration. It's a fascinating illustration. He says, imagine a country in which one group of people has for  centuries enslaved to another group of people. And that's not very hard for Americans to imagine  that.

Even though the illustration doesn't completely fit. Listen. So imagine a place where one  group has enslaved for centuries another group. And therefore, whenever a member of the enslaved  group would in the street meet a member of the oppressing group, the member of the oppressing  group could order that other person around to do anything. And if the person didn't obey,  the member of the oppressing group could have in beaten or killed.

Had the right, had the power,  could do it. But then, a good king comes into power. And he decrees emancipation for all the  slaves. And he sets up his soldiers and he sets up his police in every town and puts his judges  in his place. And they're free.

But the illustration goes on, do you think that's all it takes? It says the reality is that whenever a member of the enslaved group haven't been enslaved all  their lives haven't been enslaved for centuries. Whenever a member of the enslaved group would meet a  member of the oppressing group, they would tremble and quake. And when the members of the  impressing group would still order around the members of the enslaved group and tell them what to  do and say, go here and go there. They did it.

They did it. Now, the member of the oppressing  group didn't have the power really to do that anymore. And if they'd stood up, they couldn't have  done a thing. And yet over and over and over again, the member of the enslaved group continued to  act like slaves because though their status had changed, really changed. The reality really changed.

They were truly free. They hadn't grasped it. They hadn't realized it. They couldn't live  according to it. They remained as slaves.

And Lloyd Jones said, he ends his illustration by  saying every Christian in this room is in that condition. It's the only reason you do anything  wrong is the only reason you cannot change is the only reason you are still all wrapped up and  absorbed in, you know, epi fears and epi anger and epi discouragement all the time. And while you  can't break your habits, you don't know who you are. You've got a real status change. It's really  there.

It's not just in your mind. It's not just symbolic. It really happened. And yet you don't  know who you are. That's why it takes so long.

It took long for that group. It's going to take  long for us. You say, well, I know. But you know what? I've even heard that illustration because  I've been here for 15 years.

And I've heard you even say that. And I'm still not sure that I'm  still not changing like I should. One more question. One more answer. In verse 17, it says, you were slaves  as soon.

But thanks be to God, you wholeheartedly obeyed the form of teaching to which you were  interested. Now, the form of teaching is the first part of Romans. It's the gospel. And it says,  you used to be slaves of sin, but the gospel set your heart on fire. And in the end, going through  a little set of steps with a counselor or with a pastor is still not really the secret.

And here's  why. Years ago, in the beginning of time, according to the Bible, the serpent said to Adam and Eve,  if you utterly offer yourself to God, if you do whatever he says unconditionally, if you obey him  completely, he will abuse you. And you see, all of us sons of Adam and daughters of Eve have had  that lie come down into our hearts. It's still there. We believe, see, it says, offer yourself to  God.

And there's a part of our heart that say he will abuse us like all the other masters. See, when we're living for career, or we're living for love, or we're living for these things,  we don't feel like we're enslaved. But when the idea of giving ourselves to God, offering ourselves  to God, unconditionally, we have to do whatever he says, anything in the Bible we have to say it,  we have no more freedom. That feels terrible. And so we say, I can't do it.

I can't do it. We're  afraid to do it. And so we live in our kind of illusion of independence. We're actually in  slaves instead of going into what looks to us like slavery, which is actually the freedom of service  to God. How are we going to break that?

And the answer is, the gospel, what Jesus did, has to  inflame the heart. I recently read an essay about a movie, which I haven't seen, but I'd like to  rent now that I read the essay. It was a movie about Vietnam right after the Vietnamese war,  you know, like in the 70s. And it's a movie called Three Seasons. And it's got four vignettes in it.

And one of them is about a cyclodriver named Hai, H-A-I. And the cyclodriver is a bicycle  rickshaw. And he's poor, impoverished. And he loves Lawn, L-A-N, a prostitute, a beautiful  prostitute. Now both Hai and Lawn have completely unfulfilled desires because Hai can't afford Lawn.

And Lawn, as a prostitute, is trying to sleep her way out of the life she hates. She hates the  life of poverty. She hates the dirty life she's in. And she longs to be able to go to the clean,  beautiful life of the people who live in those elegant hotels where she has to come and do tricks for  her customers, but she has to leave because she's never allowed to stay overnight. And she dreams  of someday leaving the world of poverty and getting into that world, the world of the hotel,  the world of the people who are able to live there.

But it's not working because the more she  gives herself to prostitution in order to get out of her poverty, the more she's being brutalized,  the more she's being enslaved. But then Hai enters a cyclod race and to his surprise wins the grand  prize. And now he's got a bunch of money. And because he's got a bunch of money, maybe his  life can change, but guess what he does? He blows it all on one thing.

He rents a room in this  elegant hotel overnight and he pays lawns fee. And so I want to see you in that room tonight. All the money. Okay, well, he's going to get his harsh desire, right? And so everybody, all the  viewers are expecting this steamy cinematic love scene.

Of course, it's after all. It's a Sundance  Film Festival movie. There's going to be a lot of sex in it. So we're all expecting it and lawns  expecting it too. But then to everybody's shock, they get there and he says, I don't want to have sex  with you.

And here's how the essay goes. This is what he actually says. He has only purchased her a  place as an actual guest in the normal world she dreams of joining. And he asks only permission to  watch her fall asleep in it. Slowly, comfortably, she falls asleep and he's gone by the morning.

Having demanded nothing from her except the chance to fulfill her desire to belong. But something snaps in her. She finds she can't go back to her whole job of prostitution. Having experienced for the first time someone who used his power to serve her rather than use her,  she gets a new sense of her own dignity. She's not the same person.

She's changed by the transforming  grace of selfless love. Now, Jesus Christ had all the power in the world. And he looks down at us and he sees us trapped in the things that we think are going to free us,  but they're enslaving us. And what does he do? Philippians 2 says he emptied himself and became a servant.

Mark chapter 1045 says, I came not to be served. He says, but to serve and give my life a ransom for many. John chapter 13 says he took off his outer garment and he girded himself as a servant in order to  wash her feet. And what does this mean? He laid aside the infinities and the immensities of his being  and he purchased not just at the cost of money, but at the cost of his life.

A room in the only place there are hearts can rest his father's house. He denied himself to love us and if Lawn was transformed by the knowledge of his selfless love,  how much more will we be able to say like a gustan to all the spiritual masters and all the  spiritual mistresses out there? It's not me. Now, why wouldn't you want to offer yourself to the  only master in the universe who's offered himself for you? He's offered himself absolutely utterly.

Trust him then. Your career, give yourself to your career, careers never going to die for you. Your career is never going to offer itself for you. If you don't fulfill its dictates,  it will punish you all of your life. Give yourself to him.

Give yourself to the one master who became  a servant and you'll know what Thomas Kramer in the old prayer book said that his service alone  is perfect freedom. Let's pray. We thank you father for this overview of how we can change  and what true freedom is and we ask that you would help us to apply it to our hearts  with your Holy Spirit and we ask it through Jesus and His name we pray. Amen.

### 引言：福音与改变

你是否渴望在你的生活、习惯、关系、心灵中看到真正的改变？今天，Tim Keller 探讨了基督徒生活中持久改变的实际发生方式，以及为什么福音提供了一种与其他任何事物截然不同的转变过程。经文来自罗马书第六章。

> “那么，我们该怎么说呢？我们要继续犯罪，好让恩典增多吗？绝对不行。我们已经向罪死了，怎么还能活在其中呢？”

**如果你需要在生活中看到改变，这如何从对耶稣的信仰中流出？**

### 认识你的属灵奴役

#### 1. 理解奴役

保罗说：“难道你们不知道，当你们把自己献给某人顺从他为奴仆时，你们就是顺从他的人吗？”这种奴役的概念对原始读者来说并不如对我们那样令人震惊。

- 在第一世纪，卖身为奴是一种偿还债务的方法。
- 保罗用这个来说明属灵的奴役。

#### 2. 属灵的主人

保罗解释说，每个人都有一个属灵的主人。**你要么侍奉神，要么侍奉其他东西。**

- 每个人都为某事而活：事业、家庭、成就等。
- 这些成为控制我们的属灵主人，通过“邪恶的欲望”来控制我们。

### 意识到你与耶稣的宇宙性联合

#### 1. 与基督联合

保罗说：“我们若在他死的形状上与他联合，也必在他复活的形状上与他联合。”

- 洗礼象征着我们与基督的联合。
- **耶稣的过去和未来现在是我们的。**

#### 2. 宇宙的重生

“Palingenesia”一词指的是宇宙的重生。耶稣用它来描述万物的更新。

- **未来世界的力量现在在我们里面工作。**

### 每天活出你的新身份

#### 1. 新身份

“我们的旧人和他同钉十字架，使罪身灭绝。”

- **你的旧身份已消失；你在基督里有了新的身份。**

#### 2. 每日生活

“要算自己向罪是死的，在基督耶稣里向神是活的。”

- **每天活出你的新身份。**

### 结论

为什么你不愿意把自己献给宇宙中唯一为你献身的主人呢？信靠他吧。让我们祷告。

> “我们感谢你，父，感谢你让我们了解如何改变以及什么是真正的自由。”

**阿门。**

## Chinese Transcript / 中文

今天，提姆·凯勒要探讨：一个基督徒生命中的持久改变究竟是怎样发生的，以及为什么福音所提供的改变之路，和世间一切其他转化方式都截然不同。经文出自《罗马书》第六章：

“这样，怎么说呢？我们可以仍在罪中，叫恩典显多吗？断乎不可！

我们在罪上死了的人，岂可仍在罪中活着呢？岂不知我们这受洗归入基督耶稣的人，是受洗归入他的死吗？所以，我们借着洗礼归入死，和他一同埋葬，原是叫我们一举一动有新生的样式，像基督借着父的荣耀从死里复活一样。我们若在他死的形状上与他联合，也要在他复活的形状上与他联合。

因为知道我们的旧人和他同钉十字架，使罪身灭绝，叫我们不再作罪的奴仆。因为已死的人是脱离了罪。这样，你们向罪当看自己是死的；向神在基督耶稣里，却当看自己是活的。所以，不要容罪在你们必死的身上作王，使你们顺着身子的私欲。也不要将你们的肢体献给罪作不义的器具；倒要像从死里复活的人，将自己献给神，并将肢体作义的器具献给神。罪必不能作你们的主，因你们不在律法之下，乃在恩典之下。”

“这样怎么样呢？我们在恩典之下，不在律法之下，就可以犯罪吗？断乎不可！岂不晓得，你们献上自己作奴仆，顺从谁，就作谁的奴仆吗？或作罪的奴仆，以至于死；或作顺命的奴仆，以至成义？感谢神，因为你们从前虽然作罪的奴仆，现今却从心里顺服了所传给你们道理的模范。你们既从罪里得了释放，就作了义的奴仆。”——这是上帝的话。

我们刚刚结束了一系列关于“为什么以及如何信耶稣”的信息。现在，我想做一个短系列：如果你已经信了耶稣，这个信心究竟是怎样真正改变你的？也就是说，改变的过程到底是什么？

如果你现在生命里确实需要一些改变，那这些改变是如何从你对耶稣的信心中流出来的？

当我第一次拥抱信仰的时候，大概是在大学后期、刚毕业那段时间，我生命中有许多领域需要剧烈的改变。但当时似乎什么都不奏效。直到有两位基督徒作者——一位是十六世纪的约翰·欧文，另一位是二十世纪的约翰·斯托得——他们在各自的著作里，都把我带到了《罗马书》第六、七、八章。

在这些地方，保罗比在他任何其他书信、甚至整本圣经的任何地方，都更全面地阐述：信靠基督如何具体地带来改变，这个过程究竟由哪些部分组成。顺便说一句，在《歌罗西书》第三章里，他用得更简练；但最完整、最展开的，就是在《罗马书》六到八章。而这正是我们接下来要看的。我会带你们到那里去。对我而言，那有点像“回家”——在接下来这几周短短的时间里，我要带你们一起回到那里。

整段经文——第六、七、八章——是围绕着你们刚才听到的那个问题而展开的，这个问题在第1节和第15节被重复提出，你们刚刚也听见了。这个问题是从保罗对福音的教导中生出来的：在《罗马书》1到5章，他铺陈了福音。

而福音当中有一个主题，是一切世界宗教和哲学里所没有的、独一无二的：就是“救恩是被领受的，而不是靠成就换来的”。人得救，不是基于你的功劳、善行，或你里面任何值得称赞的东西。

这是极其激进的。只要你认真听见这种教导，只要真正明白福音，立刻、不可避免地就会生出一个问题：等等，如果是这样，如果救恩完全是出于恩典、与我怎么活没有关系，那我是不是就可以随便活了？既然如此，为什么还要改变？这样的信息怎么会改变一个人呢？照理说，这样的信息应该会让你保持原样，才对，不是吗？

保罗在这里就是在回答这个问题：如果你真的理解福音，为什么你会改变？你要怎么改变？你为什么会想要改变？他都在这里回答了。而在回答的过程中，他提出了三个关键原则——就我自己的经历、我多年来牧养人的经验，以及我对圣经的研究而言，这三点是绝对关键的。

三个关键、三个秘诀、三个原则——叫什么都行，但我真的希望你认真地听。它们是通往深刻生命改变的三把钥匙：

第一，你必须认清自己属灵奴役的形状；
第二，你必须认识自己与耶稣那“宇宙性联合”的广度与深度；
第三，你必须每天活在你新的身份里。

认清属灵的奴役——它的形状、它的样式。
认识你与基督那宏大的宇宙性联合。
并且每天从你新的身份出发来生活。

奴役、联合、身份——我们来看这三点。

顺带说一下，如果你听完这篇讲道，会觉得：“我还需要更多细节。”那是正常的——这一篇只是一个系列的引言，后面还会继续。所以请再来。若我把这篇讲道讲得“太完整”，就不适合作序言了，所以我不会讲得面面俱到，这是故意的。

首先，这段经文告诉我们：你必须认出自己的属灵奴役。我特别看第15、16节。在15、16节中，保罗说——尤其是16节：在他问完“这样怎么样呢？我们在恩典之下，不在律法之下，就可以犯罪吗？”以后，他马上说：“岂不晓得，你们献上自己作奴仆，顺从谁，就是谁的奴仆吗？”

也就是说，你若把自己献给谁去顺从，就成了谁的奴仆——“或作罪的奴仆，以至于死；或作顺命的奴仆，以至成义。”

对我们今天的人来说，16节前半段听起来挺震撼的；但对第一世纪的读者来说，却没那么突兀。我们觉得震撼，是因为当我们读圣经里关于“奴仆、奴隶”的语言时，总是透过自己对“新大陆奴隶制度”的经验过滤——我们想到的是“按种族划分、终身为奴”。

但在第一世纪，如果一个人背负了终身都还不清的巨额债务，不想一辈子都被这债压着，那并不罕见的作法，就是把自己卖给某个人做奴仆一段时间——五年也好、十年也好——尽可能快地把债还清。所以，人会“把自己献上”进入奴役关系，进入“债仆”的身份。

保罗说，问题是：你确实得到了某种好处——你的债清掉了。但代价是：那个人如今成了你的主人，他对你的生命有绝对的掌控。

这前半段，对原来的读者来说并不难理解。但后半句——破折号之后的内容——才是让他们震惊的地方。

因为保罗接下来把这件事带进属灵的层面，说：你们难道没意识到，世界上只有两种人——要么是顺服神、把自己完全无条件交给神作他奴仆的人；要么是属灵上受其他事物奴役的人。除此之外，没有第三种人，没有中间地带，没有其他可能。

保罗在这里，其实是从十诫的第一条启程：在那里神说：“我是耶和华你的神……除我以外，你不可有别的神。”第一条诫命只承认两种可能：
要么你让神作神；
要么你让别的东西作你的“神”。

没有第三种可能，没有中立地带。你若不敬拜真神，就必然会让别的东西在你生命中作“神”（哪怕只是个小写的 god）。没有任何人是“没有神”的。

你可能会问：怎么会这样？保罗的意思是：每个人都在“为某个东西而活”。什么意思呢？

为某个东西而活，就是说：在每个人心里，总有那么一个“最主要的东西”，是你意义感的主要来源，是你安全感的主要来源。它是你觉得自己有价值、有分量、活着有意义的最主要依据；也是你面对人生困难和危险时，主要倚靠的东西。

不管你在宗教、哲学上持什么理论，不管你嘴上怎么说——在现实里，总有某样东西，成了你“主要的意义来源”和“主要的安全来源”。

那可以是事业、家庭、成就；可以是个人的独立自主，或别人对你的依赖；可以是权力、影响力，或人的掌声与认可；可以是一个政治理想，可以是金钱，可以是浪漫关系，可以是外在美貌……可以是非常多的东西。

但保罗在这里要说的是：你总会为某个东西而活。总有某个东西，让你觉得“我的生命因此才有意义”，让你觉得“我因此才值得被看重”。

而他要告诉你的是：无论那个东西是什么，它已经成了你的“属灵主人”。它在支配你。你以为是它在为你做什么——它确实在给你点什么——但与此同时，你也已把自己献给它，把自己交给它，受它掌控、受它驱策。它成了你的属灵主宰。

你说：“怎么会这样？”保罗的答案（如果你听过我讲这个主题，会知道这里一定会冒出一个希腊动词），就在12节：“不要容罪在你们必死的身上作王，使你们顺着身子的私欲。”

不要让罪作王——也就是说，总会有个属灵的主宰。而你把自己献给了谁，谁就会借着“私欲”（或作“邪情私欲”）来辖制你。

这里的这个词，翻译起来其实很难。旧版《英王钦定本》常把它译作“肉体的情欲”（lusts of the flesh）。从字面看，这也不算坏的翻法，但对我们今天的耳朵来说，“肉体的情欲”几乎等同于“性欲”；可这段经文讲的并不仅仅是性。

原文里有一个词根 thumia，表示“渴望、欲望、驱动力”；前面加了一个前缀 epi，就成了 epithumia，意思是“过度的欲望”“过头的渴望”“失控的驱动”。它不是说“你去渴望坏东西”，而是说：你把“好东西”渴望到变了质，变成“终极的东西”。

也就是说，你不是因为追求坏事而失控，而是因为把好事当成了终极，才失控。你把生命中本来是好、但有限的东西，变成了你终极的意义和安全来源，于是你“非要不可、不可或缺”，因此就被它辖制。

让我给你三个“epithumia——过度欲望”的测试，三种形态，可以帮助你看见：你真正的属灵主宰在哪里。

第一个是愤怒。

当某样“好东西”被阻挡，你会生气，这是正常的；但当某样“终极的东西”被挡住，你就会“过度地生气”，彻底失控。你会说出事后自己都不明白的话，大爆发，或者深深地苦毒。你有没有发现自己很难饶恕某个人？你一直过不去？在最深处，通常就是因为有个属灵主宰在那儿——某种过度的欲望被触犯了。

你会开始说：“等等，这好像真得逼我重新审视自己的人生。”——这正是保罗要达到的目的。

第二个是恐惧。

当某样“好东西”受到威胁，你会担忧；但当某样“终极的东西”受到威胁，你会被恐惧彻底麻痹，整个人崩溃，脑子停转，焦虑到无法自控。你害怕到心里知道自己已经被什么东西驱赶、奴役。

那是因为某个属灵主宰、某种“神”，正在以过度的恐惧来控制你。

第三个是悲伤。

当你失去某样“好东西”，你会哀伤、哭泣，这非常痛，需要好几个月才能慢慢走出来；但当你失去的是“终极的东西”，你会想“干脆从桥上跳下去算了”。你觉得人生再也没有意义。

马丁·路德在《大要理问答》里——那是一部非常杰出的著作——解释十诫中的第一条：“除我以外，你不可有别的神。”他指出：第一条诫命其实是所有其他诫命的基础。一个人生命中从不可能有任何其他的错行——你不会过度地愤怒、过度地恐惧、过度地沮丧；你不会说谎、不会杀人、不会偷盗、不会做任何其他错事——除非你先犯了第一条诫命：

你在生命里树立了某个偶像，而正是这个偶像，成了你一切所作所为的深层动机。它是你一切行为背后的底层驱动力。

如果你有饮食失调的问题，你其实是把“瘦”当成了神——在你心底，有一个声音说：“只要我能变得那样瘦、那样好看，我就会好起来。”

如果你是个工作狂，你知道你拼命过头地工作，那很可能是你把金钱、地位或成就当成了神。形式可能很多，但本质一样：你为它而活。

如果你在一段关系里，明知对你和对对方都很糟，人人都看得出这是段坏关系，但你就是死活离不开，那你很可能是把“男女情爱”当成了神——你无法想象自己一个人活着。

这些东西已经抓住你了。保罗要说的是：世上的每个人都有属灵的主宰，没有人是真正自由的。你以为自己在掌控人生，以为你是自己的主人，其实不是。除非你认清这个幻觉，你永远不会做出真正需要做的改变。

所以，当有人说：“既然一切都是恩典，那我干嘛还要遵行神的旨意？干嘛不按自己的意思活？”——保罗的回答是：如果你这样说，那你对人心是如何运作的，简直是“滑稽地天真”“致命地天真”。

你若不把自己完全献给神、完全归他所有，你就已经彻底失控了——只是你没看见而已。每个人被辖制的方式不一样，各人的属灵主宰、属灵“奴役形状”也不同。

所以，任何重大改变的第一步，就是认真认识自己——认出你自己的属灵奴役长什么样。

这是第一点。

今天，提姆·凯勒要带我们来思想：在一个基督徒的生命里，真正持久的改变到底是如何发生的？为什么福音所提供的转变之道，与世上一切别的改变方式都截然不同？今天的经文在《罗马书》第六章。

“这样，怎么说呢？我们可以仍在罪中，叫恩典显多吗？断乎不可！我们在罪上死了的人，岂可仍在罪中活着呢？岂不知我们这受洗归入基督耶稣的人，是受洗归入他的死吗？所以，我们借着洗礼归入死，和他一同埋葬，叫我们一举一动有新生的样式，像基督借着父的荣耀从死里复活一样。我们若在他死的形状上与他联合，也要在他复活的形状上与他联合。”

“因为知道，我们的旧人和他同钉十字架，使罪身灭绝，叫我们不再作罪的奴仆；因为已死的人是脱离了罪。这样，你们向罪当看自己是死的，向神在基督耶稣里却当看自己是活的。所以不要容罪在你们必死的身上作王，使你们顺着身子的私欲。也不要将你们的肢体献给罪作不义的器具；倒要像从死里复活的人，将自己献给神，并将肢体作义的器具献给神。罪必不能作你们的主，因你们不在律法之下，乃在恩典之下。这样怎么样呢？我们在恩典之下，不在律法之下，就可以犯罪吗？断乎不可！岂不晓得，你们献上自己作奴仆，顺从谁，就作谁的奴仆吗？或作罪的奴仆，以至于死；或作顺命的奴仆，以至成义。感谢神！因你们从前虽然作罪的奴仆，现今却从心里顺服了所传给你们道理的模范。你们既从罪里得了释放，就作了义的奴仆。”

这是上帝的话。

我们刚刚结束了一系列关于“为什么以及如何信耶稣”的讲道。现在，我想用一个短系列来谈：如果你已经信了耶稣，这样的信心究竟如何在你生命里带出真实的改变？这种改变是借着什么样的过程真正发生的？如果你渴望在自己的生命中看见改变，那这种改变是怎么从对耶稣的信心流出来的呢？

当我第一次接受信仰的时候，大概是在大学快结束、刚刚毕业那段时间，我生命里有好几件事都需要发生极其深刻的改变。但无论我怎么努力，似乎什么办法都不太奏效——直到有两位基督徒作家，一位是十六世纪的约翰·欧文，另一位是二十世纪的约翰·斯托得（我算是“在书里遇见”他们），他们都在自己的著作中，把我带到《罗马书》第六、七、八章。

在那几章里，保罗比圣经中任何别的地方都更充分地说明：信靠基督究竟怎样具体地带来改变，这个过程真正包含了什么。更简要的版本其实在《歌罗西书》第三章，但最丰满、展开得最彻底的，就是《罗马书》六到八章。接下来几个礼拜，我要带你们一起走进这段经文。对我个人来说，这段经文有点像“回家”；而我也想在接下来的几个主日里，带你们一同回到这里。

整段经文——第六、七、八章——都围绕着刚才读经中重复出现的一个问题而展开，你在第一节和第十五节都听见了同样的提问。这个问题是从保罗在《罗马书》一到五章中关于“福音”的教导而生出来的：他在那里系统地阐明福音。

而福音里有一个核心主题，是所有世界宗教、所有哲学体系中都找不到的：那就是——救恩是“领受”的，不是“挣来”的；救恩不是根据你的功德、你的好行为，或你里面任何值得称赞的地方而赐下的。

这是一个极其激进的观念。每当你真正听见这样的教导，每当这福音的内容被清楚宣讲出来，人们立刻、而且几乎是必然地会在第一时间问出同一个问题：等等，如果真是这样——如果救恩完全出于恩典，跟你如何生活无关——那岂不是可以随便犯罪？为什么还要改变？为什么这种信息会带来生命的更新呢？在我看来，有人也许会说：这种信息听起来反而只会让人维持原样，一点都不会改变。

保罗就在这里回答这个问题。若你真正明白福音，你会问：那我为什么会改变？我怎样改变？我为什么会想要改变？保罗在回答这些问题的过程中，提出了三个原则。就我自己研经的体会，也就我多年牧养人的经验来看，这三个原则对真正深刻的生命改变是绝对关键的。

三个关键、三个秘诀、三个原则——你可以随便怎么称呼，但我真的盼望你认真听进去。三把通往真实生命改变的钥匙：

第一，你必须认出自己属灵奴役的形状是什么；
第二，你必须看见自己与耶稣之间那种“宇宙性联合”的广度和范围；
第三，你必须每天活在你已经得到的新身份里面。

换句话说：先看见你属灵的奴役，再看见你与基督的联合，最后活在你得到的身份中——奴役、联合、身份，我们来一一看这三方面。

顺带一提，如果你听完今天的讲道，觉得：哇，我还需要更多细节——那正合我意。今天其实只是一个系列的引言，后面还会继续展开。所以，请再回来。严格说来，如果我要把今天这篇讲到“讲好”，我就得承认：我不会把它讲“完整”——因为它只是一个开头。

首先，这段经文告诉我们：你必须认出自己属灵奴役的真实面貌。我在这里特别看的是第十五、十六节。保罗在十五、十六节——尤其十六节——这样说：在他刚刚提出那个问题之后，“这样，我们在恩典之下，不在律法之下，就可以犯罪吗？”（意即：既然不在律法之下，是不是就可以随便犯罪？）他紧接着说：“断乎不可！岂不晓得，你们献上自己作奴仆，顺从谁，就作谁的奴仆吗？”

不论是“作罪的奴仆，以至于死”，还是“作顺命的奴仆，以至成义”，总之，你献给谁，就属于谁。十六节前半句，对当时的读者来说，并不像对我们今天的人那么震惊。我们之所以觉得圣经里关于“奴隶”的语言很难接受，部分原因是我几周前提过的：我们总是用“新大陆奴隶制度”的经验去读圣经——也就是以“种族为基础、终身为限”的那种奴役制度。

但在第一世纪，如果一个人背负了巨额债务，看不到任何还清的希望，又不想一辈子都被债务拖累，那么并不罕见的做法，就是“把自己卖给”某一个主人，服事一段时间——可能是五年、十年——用最高效率来偿还债务。因此，你会“把自己献上”为某人的奴仆，进入“债役”或“契约奴仆”的身份。

但保罗说，问题在于：你的确从中得到了某些东西——例如摆脱债务——可是，从那一刻起，那个人就成了你的主人，他拥有对你生命的完全主权。这一点，对当时的读者来说并不意外；真正令人震惊的是后半句，也就是那道破折号之后的话。

因为接下来，保罗把这幅图像带进“属灵领域”里，他说：你们难道不明白吗？世界上只有两种人：一类是顺服神、把自己完全交给神作奴仆的人；另一类则是属灵上受别的东西奴役的人。除此之外，并没有第三个类别，没有中间地带，没有别的选项。只有这两种状况。

保罗在这里，其实是从十诫中的第一条诫命出发。第一条诫命里，上帝说：“我是耶和华你的神……除我以外，你不可有别的神。”换句话说，我必须成为你的神，你不能为自己雕刻偶像。请留意：第一条诫命只给出了两种情形：要么让耶和华作神，要么把别的东西当作“神”。并没有第三种可能，没有替代选项。如果你不敬拜真神，你就一定会在生命中立起别的“神”。即便那个“神”只是一个小写的 g，你也不可能“什么都不拜”。世上没有任何一个人完全没有神。

你也许会问：怎么会这样呢？保罗要我们思想的是：每个人都“为某样东西而活”。我是什么意思呢？为某样东西而活，也就是：在你的生命当中，总会有一个“最主要的东西”，它是你价值感的主要来源，是你安全感的主要根基；是让你觉得自己有意义、生命值得活下去的关键所在。

同样地，在面对人生的艰难和风险时，你总是会有一个最主要的依靠。无论你在教义上如何表述对宗教的看法，在实际生活中，总有一个东西是你获得意义与安全的“最主要方式”。

那可能是事业、家庭、成就，也可能是个人的独立自主，或是让很多人依赖你；可能是权力与影响力，也可能是别人的认同和好评；

也可能是一项政治事业；可能是金钱；可能是浪漫关系；可能是自己的外表吸引力；可能是很多很多东西。但保罗要说的是：无论那是什么，你总是会“为某样东西而活”。总有某个东西，让你的生命因此觉得有意义，让你觉得自己有价值。

然而，他接着说：你们没有意识到的一点是——那样东西，其实就是一个“属灵的主人”。它在操控你。你以为是它在为你做什么，而且它确实也在为你做点什么；但与此同时，你已经把自己献给了它，把自己交给了它，你处在它的掌控之下。你被它牵着走——它就是你的属灵主人。

这到底是怎么发生的呢？保罗在这里是这样回答的——如果你听过我讲这类主题，你大概知道：只要我讲到这个题目，附近通常都会出现一个特定的希腊动词。这个动词就在第十二节里：“所以不要容罪在你们必死的身上作王，使你们顺着身子的私欲。”——“不要让罪作王”。你看，这里出现了“作王”、“掌权”的语言：你总会被某个东西辖制、作它的奴仆；而那个东西，就是通过“私欲”来管辖你。

这里译作“恶欲”、“私欲”的那个词，其实很难翻。早期英文《钦定本圣经》通常把它翻成“肉体的情欲”（lusts of the flesh）。从字面上看，这个翻译并不算差，可问题是，在今天的语境里，“情欲”几乎只让人想到“性”。但这里保罗并不是在讲性欲。

这个词的构词里有一个词根 *thumia*，意思是“欲望”、“渴望”或“驱动”；但前面还有一个前缀 *epi-*，合起来就是 *epithumia*，意思是“过度的欲望”、“过头的渴望”。所以，这个词讲的不是“对坏东西的渴望”，而是“对好东西的过度渴望”。正是这种“过度的欲望”，让你失去自由。

你生命里本来是一些好东西，但你把它们抬举成“终极的东西”，于是它们就开始辖制你——因为如果它们真成了你意义感的来源、你安全感的根基，你就“非得拥有它们不可”，于是它们就通过这种“过度的欲望”来掌管你。

让我给你三个测试，或者说三种“过度欲望”的表现，藉此帮你看见自己生命中那些属灵主人的位置。

第一个是愤怒。如果有东西拦阻了你对“某个好东西”的追求，你会生气，这是正常的反应。但如果拦阻的是你生命中的“终极东西”，是你用来建立整个人生的东西，你就会“过度愤怒”（epi-angry）：
你会完全失控，说出一些事后连自己都无法理解的话，大爆发，或者陷入极深的苦毒里。现在，你是否有哪个人，让你非常难以饶恕？你发现自己怎么都放不下？在那种无法饶恕的深处，往往就隐藏着一个属灵主人——你因为对某样东西有“过度的欲望”，以致它在掌控你。

第二个测试是恐惧。如果有一个“好东西”正面临威胁，你会忧虑、会担心，这是正常的。但如果受到威胁的是你生命里的“终极东西”，你就会被恐惧麻痹。你会彻底崩溃，无法自拔，无法控制自己的焦虑。

你是否恐惧到无法思考？是否有某件事一旦想到，就让你整个心思都被吞没，好像被驱赶着走？那往往是因为有某个属灵主人在辖制你、驱动你。

第三个测试是悲伤。如果你失去的是某个“好东西”，你会哀痛、会流泪，那是很自然的，有时要花上好几个月才能慢慢走出来。但如果你失去的是你生命中的“终极东西”，你就会产生一种想要“直接从桥上跳下去”的冲动——你会觉得人生完全没有意义。

马丁·路德在《大要理问答》中，对第一条诫命“除了我以外，你不可有别的神”做了非常精辟的阐释。他指出：第一条诫命其实是所有其它诫命的基础。换句话说，你在生命中从来不会做其他任何错事——你不会过度愤怒、过度恐惧、过度沮丧，你不会撒谎、不会杀人、不会偷窃、不会犯任何别的罪——除非你首先违反了第一条诫命。

也就是说：在所有错误的行为背后，都隐藏着同一种根本性的罪——你在生命中立起了一个偶像，而这就是你一切行为的根源，是所有事发生的底层驱动力。

如果你有饮食失调的问题，你其实是把“苗条之神”奉为偶像。在你心底深处，你对自己说：只要我够瘦，只要我看起来像那样，我就会好起来，就会被接纳。

如果你是个工作狂，你明知道自己已经过度工作了，却还是停不下来，那么你就是向“金钱之神”或“地位之神”、“成就之神”立了约——这中间有很多变体。

如果你身处一段明显有问题的关系中，你自己知道，旁人也都看得出来这段关系很不健康，却无论如何都放不下，那往往是因为你已经把“男女情爱”当成了偶像。你无法想象自己不在一段亲密关系中生活的样子。

这些东西已经抓住了你。保罗在这里要说的是：世上每一个人都在某种属灵主人的辖制之下，没有人真正自由。你以为自己在掌控人生，以为自己是“自己的主人”，其实并不是。只要你仍然抱持那种幻觉，你就永远得不到真正的改变，也不会走上那条必须要走的更新之路。

因此，他对那种说法的第一个回应是这样的：当有人说，“既然得救完全出于恩典，那我为什么还要遵行神的旨意？为什么不能照着自己的意思生活？”——保罗的回答是：如果你说“为什么不能随心所欲地活？”，那就说明你对人心如何运作是“可笑地、致命地天真”。

如果你没有完全献身于神，如果你不是属祂的，你就一定是在别的什么东西的控制之下。每个人被辖制的方式都不一样，每个人的属灵主人也不同。所以，任何真正重大的改变，第一步就是要认识你自己，认出你“属灵奴役”的独特形状。

这是第一点。

第二点（第二点和第三点是连在一起的），如果你要领受基督所赐、足以带来改变的资源，你必须看见你与祂之间那种“宇宙性联合”的广度与范围。这段经文的心脏，也是整整三章经文的中心，都集中在第三到第五节：
“岂不知我们这受洗归入基督耶稣的人，是受洗归入他的死吗？……
若我们在他死的形状上与他联合，也要在他复活的形状上与他联合。”

首先，他在这里讲的是谁呢？讲的是“受洗的人”。那是什么意思？基本上，他是用“受洗”这个词来指代“归信的人”。谁是“受洗的人”？就是那些已经把生命交托给基督的人。洗礼有点像婚戒——“爱上一个人”和“把一生交给一个人”是两回事；“恋爱”是一回事，“立约承诺”是另一回事，而戒指就是后者的记号；照样，“受洗”就是这种公开、终身的委身记号。

所以，当他提到“受洗的人”时，他并不是在讲某一类“超级基督徒”，也不是在讲少数属灵“菁英”，而是指一切真正把生命交托给耶稣的人。

那对这些人来说，有什么是真的呢？第五节说：他们“与他联合”。“我们与他联合”。这里的“联合”是个很特别的词，原本是一个园艺学用语，意思是“被嫁接到某个根上”。更准确地说，是被嫁接到那棵树的根部，而不是嫁接在枝条上（虽然圣经别处也有用“枝子和树干”的比喻）。这个比喻要强调的是：我们的生命已经插入到他生命最根部的地方。

这是什么意思？第五节接着说：我们在他的“死”上与他联合，也要在他的“复活”上与他联合——也就是说，耶稣的过去，现在成了我们的过去；耶稣的未来，现在成了我们的未来。我本来可以用一整个系列来展开这件事，但今天只能先花几分钟简要说明。

首先，经文说：我们在他里面已经“死了”。我们的过去，已经被算在他的过去里。这是什么意思？我刚才提过，《歌罗西书》第三章也讲到同样的真理，而且更简洁一些。在那里，保罗说：“你们既与基督一同复活，就当求在上面的事；那里有基督，坐在神的右边。……因为你们已经死了，你们的生命与基督一同藏在神里面。”

你在他里面已经死了，也已经与他一同复活，甚至在他里面“坐在神的右边”。这是什么意思？让我用一个比喻：想象有一个人现在很富有，你会问：他是怎么变富的？答案是：靠着自己的聪明才干和长期的辛勤努力——财富是借着他、她自己的努力而来的。

但是后来，这个人结婚了。那这笔巨大的财富，是怎样来到配偶身上的呢？是借着“法律上的联合”和“白白的恩典”。前者做了一切，辛苦劳碌、累积财富；后者只是进入婚约。因为那“法律上的联合”，另一方一下子就拥有了这一切。

这段经文告诉我们也是同样的道理：为什么耶稣基督如今坐在父神的右边？那是尊荣之位，是为元首、为得胜还朝的将军所预备的位置。为什么他在那里？因为看看他所成就的一切——看看他的一生，看看他所展现的尊贵、良善、伟大和勇敢。天父看着子，为他所成就的一切而心花怒放、满心喜悦。

而这段经文说：耶稣基督所做的一切，如今在“法律地位”上都算在你身上。你与神之间关系的决定性因素，不再是你的过去，而是基督的过去。天父爱你、悦纳你、以你为乐的方式，就好像你拥有儿子一切的荣美与荣耀一样。他看你，就像看那位爱子一样：看你是完全脱离定罪的人，好像你自己已经亲自受过刑罚，把一切罪债都清偿了。

（此处插播的书籍广告部分略。）

这是第一点：我们已经与基督的“过去”联合。

但请注意，第五节还说：我们“必然”（certainly）要在他复活的形状上与他联合。你看见那个“必然”吗？经文并没有说：“如果你之后好好过日子，如果你常常来教会，如果你来某某教会、认真做笔记、听某某牧师讲道，你就必然会……”——经文没有加上任何条件，只说“你们必然会”。

这意味着：从你信主的那一刻起，你就已经和耶稣基督的未来有了一条牢不可破的关联；你已经被绑在他的未来上了。

这是什么意思呢？新约里有一个非常有趣的希腊词，只在两处出现，它原本是一个哲学名词，叫作 *Palingenesia*。你大概能听出里面有 “genesis”（起源、创世）的字根，它的意思是“宇宙的再生”、“万物的重生”。这个词来自斯多噶哲学：他们认为历史是一个没有尽头的循环，世界会不断衰败、败坏、破碎、堕落；然后，隔一段时间就会来一次“大火的洗礼”，一场大火会临到，焚尽旧的世界，洁净一切、更新一切，使万事焕然一新，然后历史又重新开始。那就是他们所说的“永无止境的轮回”，一次又一次的 *Palingenesia*——一次次的“再生、再造、再开始”。

那我们作为基督徒相信什么呢？在《马太福音》19章28节里，耶稣刻意拿起这个词，以一种极其惊人的方式来使用：他说，“在 *Palingenesia* 的时候……”——通常被翻译为“在万物复兴的时候”——“人子坐在他荣耀的宝座上，你们为我的名撇下房屋、或弟兄、或姐妹、或父亲、或母亲、或儿女、或田地的，必要得着百倍，并且承受永生。只是有许多在前的将要在后，在后的将要在前。”

耶稣说：的确会有一次 *Palingenesia*，但不是无穷无尽的循环，而是历史正朝向的那一个终点——在那个时刻，所有一切悲哀都要变为不再真实，一切败坏都被洁净，万物都要更新，整个受造界要起舞，要在丰满与完美中运转。

那么，什么样的“火”有足够的力量来完成这一切、来重塑整个宇宙呢？答案只有一个：那就是基督在十字架上所经历的、替我们承担的审判之火。借着他已经完成的工作，将来会有那一次终极的“万物复兴”，整个宇宙都要被更新，而你——若你在他里面——已经与那未来的复活、那荣耀的更新绑在一起了。

这就是保罗在这里开始要展开的大图画：你不仅已经与基督同死、同复活；你也已经在他里面，与那将来的宇宙更新联合在一起。你的过去，被算在他的过去里；你的未来，已经被拴在他的未来上。正是这样的“宇宙性联合”，成为你脱离属灵奴役、经历真实改变的根基。

那什么样的能力，才有足够的生命力去成就这样的事呢？答案是：当耶稣基督展示他那君王般的权能、当“人子坐在他荣耀的宝座上”的那一日，将要发生的事就是——整个世界都要被洁净，一切都要重生；宇宙性的“再创造”要临到，一切忧伤都要被翻转，连历史本身都会被更新。这难道不令人惊叹吗？

但还有一件更令人惊叹的事：这个词在圣经中还出现过一次，而且出现在一个更匪夷所思的地方。在《提多书》三章五节，保罗在谈论“我们的得救”——也就是个人的得救——他说：“他救了我们，并不是因我们自己所行的义，乃是照他的怜悯，借着重生的洗和圣灵的更新。”你知道这里“重生”这个词是什么吗？正是 *Palingenesia*。

从乍看之下，这个用法几乎是“不合适”的——因为 *Palingenesia* 原本讲的是宇宙性的重生，而不是个人的更新。但你看见保罗在说什么了吗？他在说：当你一信主，圣灵就进入你的生命——这一点我们都知道。但是，你是否看见这节经文所暗示的含义？那未来的能力、那将来临到的“超越秩序”的能力、那足以更新整个宇宙的终极生命力，如今已经透过圣灵进入你的生命，并且今天就开始在你里面运行。

因此，当我们说：“既然得救全是恩典，那为什么还要过好行为的生活？”保罗的意思是：你根本不知道自己身上发生了什么，是吗？你得到的并不是一张“免死金牌”，也不只是一个简单的赦罪令；你是被与基督的过去、以及基督的未来紧紧联合在一起了。

这意味着什么？当你我来到基督面前——包括我自己——我们通常带着极其微小的期望来找他：我们想要内心的平安、想要一点方向感的调整、想要一点提振、想要感觉人生有点意义，想要一些“灵感”。我们以为自己只是在要这些东西。但实际上，神要在我们身上所做的，比我们所求、所想的要大得多。

对我和凯西来说，C.S.路易斯《返璞归真》里有一段话，一直深深影响着我们。路易斯说：

“把自己想象成一座房子。神来到你这里，要重新整修这座房子。一开始，你大概明白祂在做什么：祂在修水管、堵漏水的屋顶……这些工程你原本就知道需要做，所以并不惊讶。但接下来，祂开始动工的方式让你痛得要命，而且完全看不出意义：祂到底在干什么？

答案是：祂在这里加建一个新翼楼，在那里多添一层楼，又立起塔楼，围出院子。你本来以为，祂只是要把你修成一座‘还不错的小屋’；但祂正在建造的是一座‘宫殿’，因为祂打算亲自住在里面。

如果我们肯让祂做，祂会把我们当中最软弱、最污秽的人，塑造成光彩照人的不朽之人，浑身充满了我们今天无法想象的能量、喜乐、智慧与爱；成为一面明亮无瑕的镜子，把神那无穷的能力与喜悦和良善完美地反照回去，当然，是在受造者的尺度上。这个过程会漫长，而且在许多环节都很痛苦——但这就是我们将要面对的，没有任何比较小的目标。”

如果“作基督徒”意味着“与基督联合”，那我要提出两点建议：

第一，放弃你那些太低的目标；
第二，干脆把你所有的“自订目标”都放下。

不要再从“如果我信主，我是不是就不能做某某事？我还能不能继续拥有某某东西？”这样的角度出发。你应该预备好——神在你生命中要带来的改变，其广度和深度远远超出你原本的想象；而当这些改变真的发生时，你会无比感恩。只是，在一开始，你的思想还没被打开到足够的程度，你的灵性也还不够敏锐，你根本不知道自己真正需要什么。

所以，第一，你得认出你属灵奴役的形状；第二，你得开始抓住你与基督那“宇宙性联合”的广度和范围；

最后——这就是诀窍——你必须“每天活在你新的身份里”。你必须“每天按着你的新身份来生活”。这里有两节经文讲到这一点：

第六节说：“因为知道，我们的旧人和他同钉十字架，使罪身灭绝，叫我们不再作罪的奴仆。”这里的“旧人”，指的就是你从前的那个人，你过去的那个“自己”、旧的身份——已经“同钉十字架”了。注意这是过去式——已经完成。你的旧人、你原来的身份已经不在了。

当你成为基督徒的时候，你不再是原来那个人。所以，你的旧身份已经结束，你得到了一个新的身份，而正是从这个新身份里，你才有能力去“废掉罪身”。这并不是说你的肉身本身是邪恶的，而是说：你的身体曾经被那些属灵主人掌权——正如这节经文后半段所说。这里的“身体”，是保罗用来指你实际活在世界里的样子：你的行为、你的决定、你的日常行事。

借着你新的身份，你有能力在实际生活中，打破那些旧属灵主人的权势——这是第六节的意思。

但第十一节进一步告诉我们：“这新身份才是关键”。那里说：“这样，你们向罪也当看自己是死的；向神在基督耶稣里，却当看自己是活的。”注意：你“已经向罪是死的，已经向神是活的”，但你必须“这样看自己”——必须把自己当成是已经向罪死、向神活的人。你必须不断提醒自己，你是谁。

第十二节接着说：“所以不要容罪在你们必死的身上作王，使你们顺从身子的私欲。”这就意味着：一方面，如果你是基督徒，却在许多该改变的地方没有改变，那绝不是因为你缺少资源——你已经拥有一切所需的资源了；另一方面，这些资源需要被“调动出来”，而这不会自动发生。

换句话说，每当你活得不像你应该活的样子，每当你在某个地方始终没有改变，那是因为你忘了自己是谁；你没有按你真实的身份来思想和生活，你忘记了你在基督里是谁。

这就是关键所在。

让我用三个问题来结束（接下来几个礼拜，我会继续展开这三个问题）：第一，这到底是怎么运作的？第二，为什么改变要花这么长时间？第三，为什么这条路这么难走？

先来看第一个问题：这到底怎么运作？

你们当中有些人知道，我最喜欢用的一个例子是奥古斯丁。用温和一点的话说，在他信主之前，他在性方面的自制力是有严重问题的。但信主以后，有一天他走在街上，遇见了自己过去的一位情妇。她正是他当年特别被吸引的那个人，她追上前来，想要再次把他拉回过去那种生活方式——在当时，那可能意味着连续好几个星期沉溺在情欲里。

于是她开始对他抛媚眼、发出邀请，说服他“再上楼坐坐”。奥古斯丁则很和气、很温柔、很有风度地回应她：谢谢你，很高兴见到你，但不必了，谢谢，然后就转身准备离开。

这时，那位女子突然想到：也许他根本没认出我是谁。于是她对着他的背影说：“奥古斯丁，是我啊！”——意思是：“你认不出我了吗？是我啊！”

奥古斯丁转过身来，对她微笑，说：“我当然知道是你。但现在的我，已经不是从前的我了。”（原文大意是：“我知道，是你；但已不再是我。”）

这句话是什么意思？他的意思是：过去，我是一个“非得拥有女性的爱不可”的人；我之所以进入那些关系，无论对你对我有多破坏，从来不是出于真正的爱，而是因为我需要用你来填补我心里那无底的黑洞，而那个黑洞从来填不满。我从前是一个“不得不拥有”的人——那就是我的属灵主人。

但现在，我有了一个新的主人；当我一想到自己在祂里面是谁，想到祂怎样看我，我就不再需要这一切了。我得了自由，可以真正去爱；我不再需要以前那些我以为“非要不可”的东西。这就是他在说的。

你可以把各种情境代入这个模式，这就是改变发生的方式。你可以说：过去，我是那种一遇到批评就整个人垮掉的人，因为我一定要得到别人的完美认可；过去，我是那种无论如何都不敢分手的人；但现在，我可以按着对我和对对方真正好的方式来行动——因为在耶稣里，我已经是另一个人了。

这就是“改变是如何发生的”。

好，第二个问题：既然如此，为什么改变要这么久？

坦白说，我们都知道，有许多人已经接受了耶稣，也明白“新身份”这套真理，但一年又一年过去，他们的生命似乎仍然变化不大——或者更直接一点说：**我们**自己没有太多改变，你没有，我也没有。为什么？

大卫·马丁·劳埃德·琼斯，这位在五、六十年代于伦敦讲道的牧师，曾经用很长一套系列讲章来讲《罗马书》第六章。他在解释这一章的时候，用了一个非常耐人寻味的比喻。

他说：想象有一个国家，其中一群人把另一群人当作奴隶，压迫了好几个世纪。对美国人来说，要想象这样的历史并不太难（虽然这个比喻并不在各方面都完全贴合）。在这个国家里，每当一个“被奴役群体”的成员，在街上遇见一个“压迫群体”的成员时，后者可以随意发号施令，要前者做任何事；如果前者不听命，那压迫者有权力、也有能力殴打他甚至杀死他。

但后来，一位良善的君王登基。他颁布法令，宣布所有奴隶都获得自由；他在每个城镇设立自己的军队、警察，也派遣法官坐镇审判——从法律地位上说，这些奴隶已经真正被释放了。

然而，劳埃德·琼斯问：这样就够了吗？现实会怎样呢？他说：事实上，那些被奴役了几百年的群体、那些一生下来就做奴隶的人，只要在街上遇见压迫者，仍然会浑身发抖、心惊胆战；只要那边的人一开口吩咐：“去那里！做这个！做那个！”他们还是会下意识地顺从。

从法律上说，那些压迫者早已失去真正“驱使他们”的权柄；如果这些新近得自由的人勇敢站住，那些压迫者根本奈何不了他们。然而，一次又一次，“前奴隶们”依旧像奴隶那样反应、那样行动；因为虽然他们的“身份地位”已经真实改变了——这不是假象，而是事实——他们却还没真正明白，也还没学会按这个新身份生活，于是仍旧像奴隶一样活着。

劳埃德·琼斯在比喻的结尾说：其实，每一个基督徒都处在类似的光景里。你之所以做任何一件错事、之所以在许多地方始终无法改变、之所以常常被“过度的恐惧、过度的愤怒、过度的沮丧”所吞噬，以致无法摆脱那些坏习惯，归根到底只有一个原因：你不知道自己是谁。

你的身份地位已经真正改变——这不是心理暗示，不只是象征，而是客观发生了的事实；但你却还没真正抓住它、相信它、活在其中。这就是为什么改变会这么慢。对那群曾经是奴隶的人来说，学习按“自由人”的身份生活要花时间；对我们来说，也同样要花时间。

你可能会说：好吧，我也知道这些——甚至你们当中有人听我讲这个比喻已经十五年了——但我还是觉得自己改变得不够快、不够多。

那就必须再问一个问题，也就是第三个问题：为什么这条路这么难？

第十七节说：“感谢神！因为你们从前虽然作罪的奴仆，现今却从心里顺服了所传给你们道理的模范。”这里所说的“道理的模范”，指的就是前面几章所讲的福音。也就是说：你们从前是罪的奴仆，但福音点燃了你们的心。

换言之，归根结底，要改变一个人、要真正打破那种属灵奴役，只靠跟牧者走几步“辅导流程”是不够的。为什么？

因为在创世之初，照圣经所说，当蛇对亚当和夏娃说：如果你把自己完全交给神、无条件地顺服祂、无论祂说什么都照做——祂一定会虐待你。那一句谎言，代代相传，至今仍然潜伏在我们这些亚当的儿女、夏娃的女儿心中。

所以，当圣经说“把自己献上，当作活祭”，“完全献给神”时，我们心里会立刻有个声音说：祂会像所有其他主人那样虐待你。

我们为事业而活、为爱情而活、为许许多多的东西而活时，从来不觉得自己是“奴隶”；但一想到“完全把自己献给神、无条件顺服祂、凡圣经所说的都必须遵行、甚至好像再也没有‘自主权’”，我们就觉得那简直是可怕的奴役，于是说：我做不到，我不敢那样做。

结果，我们宁愿继续活在一种自以为“独立自主”、其实被其他主宰奴役的幻觉中，也不愿走进那看似奴役、实际上却是自由的“事奉神”的道路。

那要如何打破这层捆绑？答案是：**福音**——也就是耶稣为我们所做的——必须点燃我们的心。

最近我读到一篇影评，讲的是一部我还没看过的电影（读完之后我倒是很想去租来看）。故事发生在越战结束后的越南，大约在七十年代，片名叫《三个季节》（Three Seasons），里面有四个小故事，其中一个讲的是一个踩三轮车为生的年轻人，叫海（Hai）。

所谓三轮车，是一种“人力脚踏车”的出租车，他非常贫穷，而他爱上了一个叫兰（Lan）的妓女——一个非常美丽的妓女。海和兰都有一些强烈却未被满足的渴望：海买不起兰的时间；兰则试图靠卖淫来摆脱她讨厌的贫穷生活。

她厌恶自己所处的“肮脏世界”，渴望有一天能住进那些她每天出入、却从未真正属于她的高级酒店——在那里住的客人有干净、光鲜的生活；而她只能在那些房间里接客，完事之后就得离开，从来无法在那里过一夜。她梦想有一天能离开贫民窟，进入那些酒店所代表的“干净世界”。

但事情并不如她所愿：她越是出卖自己，希望借此脱离贫穷，就越是被羞辱、越是被奴役。

后来，海参加了一场三轮车比赛，意外赢得大奖，一下子拿到一大笔钱。照理说，他的人生此刻可以大大翻转，但你猜他做了什么？他把所有奖金都花在一件事上：他在那间高级酒店里订了一晚的房间，并付了兰的全额“服务费”，对她说：今晚，我要在那间房间见到你——所有的钱，全部都为这一晚。

观众当然会以为，接下来就是一场“火辣的性爱戏”——毕竟这是在圣丹斯影展上播映的电影，大家都以为接下来一定有重口味的镜头；兰也一定是这么想的。

但接下来发生的事，却让所有人跌破眼镜：两人进到房间后，海说：“我不要跟你发生性关系。”

影评是这样记述他的举动的：海所做的，只是用这笔钱给兰买了一个“真正住在那家酒店里”的机会——好让她第一次以“真正的住客”身份，体验她一直渴望进入的“正常世界”。他唯一的要求，就是坐在一旁，看着她在那张床上安然入睡。

兰慢慢地、很放松地睡着了。第二天早上，她醒来的时候，海已经离开，没有对她提出任何要求，没有从她身上索取任何东西，只是尽他所能成全她进入“渴望已久的世界”的梦想。

但从那以后，她再也无法回到原来的妓女生活。因为她第一次经历到，有一个人拥有权力、握有资源，却不是利用她、压榨她，而是用自己的能力来服侍她。她的自我认知被翻转了，她对自己尊严的感觉被唤醒了——她不再是原来那个人了。这就是被“无私之爱”的恩典所改变的生命。

耶稣基督拥有宇宙中一切的权能。他俯视我们，看见我们被困在那些自以为能给我们自由、实际上却奴役我们的东西里。祂做了什么呢？

《腓立比书》第二章说：祂倒空自己，取了奴仆的形象；《马可福音》10章45节说：祂来不是要受人的服事，乃是要服事人，并且舍命作多人的赎价；《约翰福音》13章说：祂脱下外衣，束上手巾，俯身替门徒洗脚——像奴仆一样服事他们。

这意味着什么？祂放下自己无限的荣耀和权柄，不只是花钱，而是付上自己的生命代价，为我们预备了一个房间——在唯一那个我们的心灵得安息的地方：天父的家里。祂否定自己，为要爱我们。

如果兰因为这样的恩典之举就被改变了，我们岂不更应该、也更能因为认识基督无私的爱而被改变，以致对所有那些“属灵的情人”和“属灵的主人”说：那已经不再是我了？

既然在全宇宙中，只有这一位主宰，为你、为我先把自己完全献上——那我们为什么不愿把自己献给他呢？

你可以信靠他，把自己交给他。

把自己献给事业吧，事业不会为你死；事业不会为你舍己。如果你没有达到它的要求，它只会用失败感惩罚你一生。

把自己献给他吧——把自己献给那位为你甘愿作仆人的主，你就会真正经历到托马斯·克兰麦在旧祷文书里所说的那句话：

“只有在他的服事中，才有完全的自由。”

让我们一起祷告：

天父，我们为你让我们看到的这一幅大图画感谢你——关于我们如何能够改变，以及真正的自由是什么。我们求你借着圣灵，把这些真理刻在我们的心里，帮助我们在日常生活中应用出来。我们奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。
