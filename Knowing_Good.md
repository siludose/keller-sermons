## English Transcript / 英文原文

today doesn't believe everybody's equal human rights. So, if you believe in human rights, do you realize what that is? It's a belief. It's a belief. And it's essentially the same as a religious belief, even though you don't call it a religious  belief, because it's a belief about human nature and about what life is about, and it's  not something you can prove, and it's not self-evident to everybody, so it's a belief.

And you see how unfair it is to say, those of you who call your beliefs religious, you  have to keep them private, and those of us who don't, we can do anything we want with  them. It's just completely unfair. But now we're still back to where we said we were, which is a question. How do we avoid just not shouting at each other? This is the right standard for right and wrong.

No, this is the standard for right and wrong, and we just yell at each other. But maybe one of the ways we can calm each other down, and maybe make for more civil  conversation, is to ask this more fundamental question, where do you get your moral convictions  about what is right and wrong, like human rights? Where do you get your moral convictions? What do you base them on? How do you determine what is right and wrong?

And the reason that's a great question is it slows everybody down, because actually we  all have very strong moral convictions about what we think is right and wrong. But as soon as you say, well, why do you believe that? On what basis do you believe that? Where do you get that? Right away, we're not as quick to know what to say.

And so it makes us stop and think and talk, and therefore we suddenly have a better conversation,  a better public conversation. Now I would say that there's almost no place I know that has a more interesting and  ingenious and creative answer to the question, where do you get your moral beliefs? Then Romans chapter 2. And here I st. Paul, this last part of Romans chapter 2, is going to tell us three things.

The first paragraph, which is 12 to 16, there, Paul is telling us, no one can succeed  in being a relativist. The second paragraph, verses 17 to 24, there, Paul's thesis is, but on the other hand,  no one really can succeed in being a moralist. And then the last part of the passage is where Paul says, therefore, this is our only  hope. No one can succeed in being a relativist. No one can really succeed in being a moralist.

And therefore this is our only hope. Let's look at these three things. First of all, no one can succeed in being a relativist. Now, verse 12, all who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and  all who sin under the law will be judged by the law. Now who is he talking about?

He's talking about the law. He means by the law, the moral law of God that's revealed in the Bible in the scriptures. Of course, at the time, Paul was talking about the Old Testament, but in the scriptures. And he was saying, some people have that. That is to say, they believe it.

They believe that the moral law of God is revealed in the Bible, and they accept it,  and they embrace it, and they take it. But there's other people who don't have it. That is they either have never heard of it, they never read the Bible, they didn't even  know about it, or they don't accept it. Now in that day, most of the people who believed that the Bible was where the revealed moral  law was were Jews, but not all, of course not. There were Gentiles who believed that too, but there were mainly Jews, so what Paul was  trying to say is some people accept the moral law of God is revealed in the Bible, some people  who did not.

That's the people who have the law and people who don't. So what does he say about them? He says three things, one of which is interesting, one of which is startling, and one of which  is radical and controversial. It's in verse 1415. Indeed, when Gentiles who do not have the law, due by nature things required by the law,  there are law for themselves, even though they do not have the law, they show that the  requirements of the law are written on their hearts.

Their conscience is also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them  in other times, even defending them. Now here's what he's saying. Here's the interesting thing. All who's sent apart from the law will perish apart from the law, those who are sent  under the law will be judged by the law. The Gentiles who don't have the law still show that they are all on to themselves.

Now the first thing he's saying, which is interesting, is that God, the judge, will not judge  you according to standards you don't accept. If you don't accept the Bible as your moral standard, then you won't be judged according  to the Bible. You'll be judged according to the moral standards that you yourself have. And therefore, what he's saying is, no one's going to be judged by any state moral standards  that they don't accept, themselves, and embraced during their lives. Interesting.

I told you it was interesting, right? Okay. Secondly, he says something else which is more startling. And that is that even if you don't have the Bible as your moral standard, you see what  he sneaks it in. In the very beginning of verse 12, you're still going to perish on judgment day.

See, all who's sent apart from the law will still perish. Why? Because in your heart, you still do know something about the moral law, and you'll be judged  according to that. Now the thing that helped me, the illustration that helped me more than anything when I was  a young Christian, I read a book by Francis Schaeffer who was talking about Romans 2 and he  used an illustration, which of course is a bit fanciful, but basically gets the idea  across. Some of you have heard me use it before because it's so helpful to me.

He says, when it says that God is not going to judge you according to any standard other  than your own, that you already know, it's a little bit like this. He says, it's like when you're born, God puts an invisible recorder around your neck. It's not only invisible, of course, you can't feel it either or hear it. And all it does is record things you say to other people that they ought to do. All it does is pick up your own standards, your own moral standards.

So anytime you say you ought to do this or you should do this, it's picking up your moral  standards. So that on judgment day, you show up at judgment day and you're already upset because  you didn't know there was going to be one, so there you are. And it's as this. It's as if. It's a little fanciful.

It still gets across the idea. This is how the old straight should go. So there you are. I'm going to check out judgment day. But guy says, hey, hey, hey, calm down.

I'm a fair guy. I'm only going to judge you according to your own standards. And so he takes the little recorder off your neck. He says, I didn't know that was there. No, it was invisible.

And he puts it down and he says, I'm just going to judge you by your own standards and you're  going to play it. And see what Paul is saying and what you know in your own heart, I hope. There's nobody on the face of the earth. There's no one in the history of the world that will be able to stand. We'll be able to pass that standard on judgment day.

Nobody will. Just nobody has ever lived up to their own standards that they have imposed on other  people. No one. So the first thing is God is very fair. He's the judge of all the earth.

That's what Paul is saying. But it's very fair. He won't judge you according to anything that hasn't been a standard you don't already  have. But then secondly, on the other hand, no one's going to pass judgment day. And then thirdly, he says something very radical and controversial.

When he says, notice, he doesn't just say that people without the law of God have their  own moral standards. He says, indeed, when Gentiles who do not have the law, do by nature things required  by the law. What's the law? Well, it's what's in here. And notice, it doesn't say that people who don't believe in the Bible know in their hearts  and in their consciences everything in the Bible doesn't say that.

That would be silly. There's plenty of people out there who have never read the Bible, know anything about  the Bible. But what it does say, that deep in their hearts are deep in their consciences, there's  some things in the moral law of God that all people know because they've all been created  by God. And at a deep level, deep level, deep level, everyone has some understanding of the moral  law of God and that divinity is behind it. And everyone's living as if that's true.

And therefore, there's a sense in which no one is really a relativist. Now that's very, very controversial. But let me spend a moment trying to give you some of the evidence for this. One of the things I've always found fascinating is when I studied, over the years, when I  studied, especially the conversion accounts of very, very, very highly intellectual, intelligent,  sophisticated academics or professors or thinkers who were skeptical or atheists or  agnostics and were converted to Christianity. It's very interesting that when I study those kinds of people, very seldom do they come  to faith in Christ through some kind of complete, by looking at the arguments for the existence  of God or the evidence for the resurrection and they say, ah, I see the evidence is that  this is true.

They don't look at it that way. Usually they come out like this. Usually I have seen, they realize that they're moral convictions, that they're moral  intuitions, that they feel very strongly, actually, assume the existence of God and they  just haven't been honest about it. And they come to realize that in their moral convictions and in their moral intuitions  they actually have sensed God. They've intuitive the existence of God.

They haven't wanted to admit it and now they do. And that's how they become Christians. It's amazing how often that happens. You say, how does that work? Well, let me give you three examples, one of which is not a conversion.

In fact, what I'm about to give you is a little summary of a philosophy book, and please  be patient with it because even if you find it a little tough to follow, it's kind of fun,  but if you find it tough to follow, oh, immediately illustrate it and help you, you know, get  it down to earth. But recently there's been a book written by a man who's not a convert, who stays what  he would call an atheist or an agnostic, Tom Nagel, professor of philosophy NYU has recently  written a book that has created a firestorm because it's brilliantly argued, and yet at  the same time, let me just read you, the title is mind and cosmos, but the key is the subtitle. Ready for the subtitle? The subtitle is why the materialist, neo-darwinian conception of nature is almost certainly false. And let me give you the nub of it.

He's got one chapter in there called value, and here's what he basically says, evolutionary  materialism. By the way, he's not against evolution altogether, what he's saying is evolutionary materialism  is the idea that you are just a body, you're just a body, and there's nothing in you that  isn't there through natural selection. Something that's true about you is true because one of your ancestors had a trait that helped  them survive, and because that trait helped them survive, they've passed that down to you. So you're just a body, and everything in you is strictly the result of natural selection. It helped you answer to survive.

That's evolution in your materialism, now he says, that means, in that account of things,  that all your moral feelings are just that, their subjective feelings. Why, for example, he says, in this view, why do we all think that torture for fun is wrong? There's a lot of arguments about torture, but here's the point, don't we all believe  that torture just for fun is wrong, really, really wrong? And if you ever do find somebody, and there are people who we find that don't think torture  for fun is wrong, we consider them very sick. They can twist it.

So we all believe that torture for fun is wrong. Why do we believe that? And see, in the view of evolution or naturalism, it's a subjective belief, and you only believe  it because some of your ancestors felt that way, and that that feeling helped them survive,  and all the people who did enjoy torture for fun have not survived, probably because they  tortured each other and killed each other. We don't know why, but that's the point. What was the mechanism?

The point is that the reason we all believe that torture for fun is wrong is because  all the people who did feel that torture for fun was okay, they died out. And the reason you have the hair color you have is because of evolution, and the reason  you have the moral feeling that torture for fun is wrong is also because of evolution, and  they come from the same, your hair color, and that moral feeling come from the same place,  and they are in the same category. They're only subjective. All your moral feelings are subjectively, you feel those things are wrong subjectively because  they helped your ancestors survive, not because they are actually, objectively, universally,  and really wrong. They're subjectively wrong because you feel it, but not because they're actually and  objectively and universally and really wrong, but just subjective.

Now, what happens, though, suppose? It turns out that there's a tribe we've discovered in some remote part of the world that their  evolution operate in a very different way. First of all, their hair color is white from the minute they're born, and the pigment  of their skin is half red and half yellow, very different. But they also find torture for fun great, they love it, you know, it's a fun. Now they're starting to move out into the world, how do you feel about them?

Well, you say, well, okay, you know, they can't help their hair color and things like that,  but that torture for fun, that's wrong, well, why is it wrong? You feel it's wrong because of your evolution, they feel it's wrong, they feel it's okay  because of their evolution, why should their hair color and their practice of torture be  any, why should you differentiate? And here's what Tom Nagel says, nobody believes that torture for fun is only subjectively  wrong. We believe it's actually and objectively and universally and really wrong whether they  feel that way or not. So if evolutionary materialism is true, then value realism, the idea that things are actually  and really wrong can't be true, but since we know some things actually and really are  wrong evolutionary materialism can't be true.

Got that? See how easy that was? You say, that's just seemed like a sleight of hand, let me give you two personal examples. W. H.

Auden, one of the great poets in history, consider one of the great writers of the  20th century, W. H. Auden, like most British intellectuals of his time, abandoned any kind  of religious faith, abandoned Christian faith, he was an atheist or he was an agnostic  and that sort of thing. And then World War II happened and his understanding, his religionless belief was thrown into  a chaos and he came out of the other side of World War II, embracing Christianity which  shocked all of his many, many of his peers, but he explained it and here's how he explained  it. Let me set it up this way.

He had believed until World War II that basically all reasonable and lightened cultured  people would believe in human rights, they'd believe in freedom, they'd believe in democracy,  they'd believe in justice for everybody. But suddenly, along comes Nazism and it's embraced by Germany and Germany is every bit as  cultured and it's sophisticated and educated, a society is Britain. You know, it's second and none, science and art and music and everything. And yet, they haven't, what Germany embraced a philosophy that did not believe in human  rights for all, did not believe in justice for all. And this is what Auden said to try to explain what happened to him.

Quote, if I'm convinced that the highly educated Nazis are wrong and that we highly educated  English are right, what is it that validates our values and invalidates theirs? The English intellectuals who now cry to heaven against the evil incarnated and Hitler  have no heaven to cry to because the whole trend of liberal thought has been to undermine  any faith in the absolute. Rather, it has tried to make reason to be the judge. Here's the problem, either we serve the unconditional absolute or some Hitlerian monster  will supply an iron convention based on reason to do evil by. Now here's what is going on, here's, do you hear what he's saying?

Ordnance saying, let's look at nature, okay, let's be science, let's look at nature,  what do we see? That's how nature operates. Oh, but then we turn around and say, well, we don't want strong races to oppress weak  races or strong nations to oppress weak nations, why? If the operational principle of nature is the strong eating the weak, what in the world  is wrong with strong nations oppressing and destroying weak nations? See, reason will find nothing wrong with injustice, with trampling on human rights.

And therefore, here's what he realized. It's possible without God to account for moral feeling. Social construction or evolutionary biology, we can say you have your moral feelings, but  it's impossible without God to believe in moral obligation. Do you hear this? Moral feeling means I subjectively feel this way.

Moral obligation is you have to do this whether you feel like it or not. Moral obligation. If there's no God, there is no moral obligation, there's only moral feelings. And here's what he said. If there's no God, then my moral obligation is imaginary, and I know moral obligation  is not imaginary, and therefore there must be a God.

And he'd been living that way all along, but he hadn't wanted to admit it. See? Romans 2. Looking at the clock, let me give you one more example. More recently, again, not a conversion story, but some years ago in the Chronicle of  Higher Education, I read a very interesting article by a woman who was a cultural  anthropologist.

She was a very, at a Northeastern university, she was a very respected academic, and she  was studying African, certain African societies, in which women were very oppressed. There was polygamy, there was female genital mutilation, and there were these things that  really bothered her very much. But she was a cultural anthropologist, and she had bought into the idea that there is  such a thing as moral feelings, but not moral obligation. She bought her understanding was, she was a skeptical, secular person, was that if you  have a moral feeling, it comes either because your culture has constructed that feeling in  you or because of biology. And so she began when she was there in Africa to sometimes push back against some of the  people in authority in those societies about how they were treating women, and basically  what the people in authority said was this, don't you lay your white Western individualistic  human rights thing on us, how dare you think that your cultures, values are right, and  ours are wrong.

What's right for us is right for us, and it infuriated her because she realized that she  had absolutely no way to answer. No way to answer, see? She had no basis for what Thomas Nagel calls value realism. She had no basis for moral obligation. So you could say I subjectively feel something's wrong, but I cannot say on any basis that  something is actually, objectively, universally or really wrong, but you know how she ends  this whole book, I mean the whole article, she says this, she says, in the end I unavoidably  believe that equal rights for women is universally true, even though I have no basis for it, so  I'm going to work for equal rights for women anyway.

See, in other words, what she's doing, she's coming really close, really close to admitting  what Paul is saying, but not she just won't go all the way, she just won't go there, but  here's the question, if you're premise, that there is no God, and therefore no moral obligation,  leads you to a conclusion that you know isn't true, which is namely there's really nothing  wrong with oppressing women in Africa, why not change your premise? Why not change your premise? So you see, it's impossible to really succeed in being a relativist, however, on the  other hand, paragraph two, and I'm giving you less time because in some ways we've covered  this and we will cover this, the next paragraph is, now you who call yourself a Jew, if you  rely on the law, now he turns to people who say, okay, I do believe the Bible, I absolutely  believe the Bible, and I accept the Bible, and I'm living according to the Bible, now we can  call those people moralists, they're not relativists, they believe in morality, and they're  living on the basis of morality, and they say I'm going to honor God, and I'm going to  obey his law, but let's not forget what Paul's already said, you're going to have no more  hope on judgment day than the relativist, you're just more consistent, I'm not sure it's  going to be a great deal of consolation. Now, why is that true? Why is it also impossible to succeed in being a moralist?

Well, the answer  is down here in 21 and 22 and 23, basically, you then who teach others, do you not teach  yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal? You who say people should commit  adultery, not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? You who boast in the law?

Do you dishonor God by breaking the law? Now, if you look carefully,  he's giving you two reasons why no moralist will stand on judgment day either. The relativist  won't, they'll find out that they didn't live up to what they did know, but the moralist  won't either. Why not? One, hypocrisy, two, idolatry.

Hypocrisy, we all kind of know about. The fact is that if they're very high standards in here, and nobody lives up to them, now Paul  gives some obvious examples of hypocrisy. I mean, I don't know, I don't know of any Christian  church anywhere where everybody believes they'll shout not commit adultery, and there isn't  still adultery. Or everybody says they'll shout not steal, they'll shout not bear false witness,  and yet there's lying, and there's stealing, and there's embezzling. So he's on the one hand,  he's saying, first of all, there's hypocrisy.

The fact is that none of us live up. But then there's  idolatry. Now, it kind of sneaks in there, and it's actually a bit of a puzzle,  except when you ask commentators what this means, they usually all say the same thing. Notice,  it says, he's talking to Jews now. Remember, he starts in verse 17.

Now you call yourself Jews,  who rely on the law. He says, do you not commit adultery? Then he says, you who abhor idols, do you  rob temples? Now, this has always been a puzzle, because there seems to be no evidence that Jews,  rob temples. He's writing to Jews in Rome, right?

He's saying, well, you know, you Jews in Rome  should stop at night going in robbing temples and getting the idols and bringing them home. Jews  didn't do that. So he's speaking metaphorically. If he's obviously not speaking literally,  and metaphorically, as we often point out, the Bible says, it's one thing to say, I believe in God,  I'm living for God, when actually you're living for money, or you're living for power, or you're  living for status. And at this point, I think what Paul is trying to show us is what I would call the  terrible inwardness of the law.

Terrible? Yes. When Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount expounds the  law, he shows the terrible inwardness of it. You know how he says, you've heard it said, they'll  show not kill, but I say you shouldn't even resent your neighbor. You've heard it said, they'll  show not committed adultery.

You shouldn't love, but I say don't lust. You've heard it said, see,  what Jesus is showing is the law when it forbids a behavior is also in joining the opposite  and calling for a spirit. So for example, where does murder come from? Murder comes from resentment  that's nurtured and nurtured and fertilized and eventually becomes murder, right? Well, he says,  then you ought to realize that all of you have resentment, and most people don't murder, but  everybody resents, and what is that?

It's murder in seed form. And so when the Bible says,  they'll show not kill, it means you should love with your whole heart and not resent. When the  Bible says they'll show not steal, it means you should never envy and also be incredibly generous. When the Bible says there should not commit adultery, it means you should be totally faithful and  chased. And when Jesus is expounding the sermon on the Mount, you realize, oh my word, nobody  lives up to this.

And yet we want other people to live up to this. I've forgotten the name of the  label. There was a woman who was taught English at some conference. No, no, she taught English at a  public university somewhere. She was a believer, but it was a public university, and she, one time,  had her class read the sermon on the Mount.

Most of them hadn't ever read it before. Some of them  hadn't heard of it. And what was interesting, they wrote response papers, and most of them hated it,  utterly hated it. If I remember the article when something like this, most of them said,  I did not like the sermon on the Mount. It made me feel very guilty.

And you know why? And one  person said, I did not like the sermon on the Mount because nobody can live like this. But here's the hypocrisy. Would you like to live in a place where people serve your needs  ahead of their own? Would you like to live in a place where people are absolutely honest and  transparent, and they never hide anything from you, and they always keep their promises?

See, in other words, we want to live in a society of people who act the way the sermon on the  Mount dictates, but we don't ourselves want to be held up to that standard because we feel, oh,  that's awful. I did not like the sermon on the Mount. It made me feel very bad. David Martin  Lloyd Jones, in his sermons on the sermon on the Mount, he says, anybody who's really read the  sermon on the Mount will not say how wonderful. They'll say, God saved me from the sermon on the Mount.

Because you see the hypocrisy, we want people to act like this, but we don't want to be held  to it ourselves. That's hypocrisy, and it will be condemned on the last day. It'll be condemned  on the last day. So what's our hope? Is there any hope?

Oh, my goodness. See, if there is no  divine judge, if there really is no God, there's no divine judge, what hope is there for the world? What hope is there that all the injustices and the terrible things that are happening will ever  be put right? What hope is there for even us to have a basis for trying to put things right? If there is no judge, if there is no divine judge, what hope is there for the world?

But if there  is a divine judge, what hope is there for me and you? Hmm, we're stuck. Thank God for 0.3s. Because 0.3 brings us to the very end, and in the very end there's this very strange  discussion about a strange thing for most of us today, which is circumcision, but the heart of  the heart of it is right here in verse 28. A person is not a Jew who is one outwardly,  nor is circumcised physically.

Now, a person is a true Jew, basically what he's saying, who is one  inwardly and who has the circumcision of the heart by the spirit. And what he's saying is the  only hope is a new heart. Circumcision of the heart means the new birth. It means a new heart,  a new inward heart. Now, how does that work?

Why? Why? What is he talking about? Well, first of all,  let's talk about circumcision for a second. This whole area, this whole section is about circumcision.

And in the Old Testament, circumcision was the right R-I-T-E by which in the Old Testament,  a family showed that they were in a covenant relationship with God. And it's how the Israelites  showed they were in a covenant relationship with God. It was the sign that they were in a relationship  with God. They were obeying God and they were following His law. So, when all the males of the  particular family were circumcised, that said, we are under the law of God and we are obeying God  and we are following God.

That's what it, but there's a problem. What's the problem? Well, the problem was  verse 17. Now, you who call yourselves Jews, if you rely on the law and boast in God and then he  goes on to talk about all the problems. Now, here's the issue.

Law reliant. See, there's no problem  with being law abiding. That's good. But what's law reliant? It's not the same as law abiding.

Law reliant makes you boast. I have a relationship with God. Why? Because I'm a good person. I'm a  decent person.

I don't do this bad thing and that bad thing. I do these things and these things and  I'm a good person. And see, law reliant screws you up so much inwardly. You know why? You're always  going back and forth between superiority and inferiority.

See, on the one hand, deep inside, we know  like those students who read the sermon on the Mount, we know we're not living it up. We're not  living up to what it should be done. We know we're not what we should be. And so, when you're law  relying and when you're saying, I'm obeying the God, God's law, and I'm trying to be moral in that  way, then I know God will bless me and he will take me to heaven. If you're law reliant like that,  on the one hand, you're always struggling with inferiority and guilt and shame and you're very,  you know, you're very sensitive to criticism and you're always feeling a little bit like a failure  or sometimes you're feeling very superior because you've done this and you've done this,  and then it makes you self-righteous and it makes you fairer-cycle.

You're going back and forth  between superiority and inferiority. There's always this churn. It does not make you a nice person. And there's always this kind of inward churn and a lack of rest and a lack of peace and it back and  forth. See, you need something.

You need something in there that you don't have. What is the solution? The solution's a new heart. And how do you get a new heart? Circumcision of heart.

It can only happen  obviously by not relying on the law. Well, what do you rely on? Here's what you rely on. Why was circumcision used as a sign? Anybody know?

It was a symbol of the punishment or the curse  of the covenant. I don't know if any of you remember there's a place in Genesis where  God, Abraham, makes a covenant with God in Genesis 15, and he cuts some animals in half  and he puts them on both sides. And the reason why he did that was in ancient times we know,  two thousand years ago, one of the ways that covenants were made between people was you cut an  animal in half and you walk between the pieces and you took your vow. You didn't sign a document  like we do now. You cut an animal in half and walk between the pieces.

Why? Because you were saying,  if I don't do everything that I'm saying today, may I be cut into pieces? You're acting out the  curse of the covenant. You're acting out the punishment for disobedience and oath breaking. So circumcision was like that because circumcision is bloody, it's icky and it means being cut off.

And what God was saying is if you take the law on and you say, yes, I'm going to come under the  law and I'm going to make this my guy, but you don't follow law, then the curse of the covenant  is to be cut off from me. And honestly, if you think, oh, this is all kind of weird and kind of  nasty, listen, you do it yourself. If someone's in a relationship with you and they can repeatedly  violate you, repeatedly go against your wishes, repeatedly break promises to you, repeatedly do  things you've asked them not to do. What do you do at a certain point? You say, I'm sorry, we can't  be friends anymore.

What are you doing? You're cutting them off. It's absolutely natural. And so circumcision is cutting off and it was the curse of the covenant. If you bring on,  if you come in and you say, I'm going to obey God's commands and then you don't do it, you're cut off.

So what hope is there for us? Because on judgment day, we're all going to be cut off and here's the  answer. The Bible says something really amazing about circumcision. Paul says it in Colossians 2, he says  this in Colossians 2 verses 11 and 12, he says, in Christ, you were circumcised. Now he's talking to  everybody, by the way, he's talking to male male and female Christian believers.

Listen, he says,  in him, you were circumcised, not with a circumcision done by the hands of men, but in the circumcision of  Christ. Now that's saying two astounding things. The first thing is that when Jesus Christ went to  the cross, he was actually being circumcised. You say, what? Yes.

It was bloody. There was a sword  and he was being cut off. When he said, my God, my God, why has that but forsaken me? He was being cut  off. Jesus Christ was the only human being who ever actually fulfilled the law.

He loved God with all  of his heart, soul and strength in mind. He loved his neighbor as himself. He loved people. He was  honest. He fulfilled the law.

His life is just a thing of beauty. When you read about it in the  gospels, there's a thing of beauty. And yet at the end of his life, he was cut off. It says in Isaiah 53,  he talks about the suffering servant who's going to come and take our transgressions upon us. It says  he was cut off from the land of the living.

He did it for us. He took the curse that we should have. And the second incredible thing Paul says is therefore in him, you are the circumcision. Now  you're saying that to male and female, by the way, interesting. All Christians, what does that mean?

It means you've already been through judgment day. In Jesus Christ, you've been through judgment day. If you believe in him, if you say father, accept me because of what Jesus has done,  he's already been through judgment day. I think there is no more astounding  picture in the Bible than the end of the book of Revelation. Not the very end, but in the book of  Revelation, the end of the Bible, where John, the apostle, gets his vision of judgment day,  and he sees everyone assembled before the throne, and there's the throne, and the throne is where  the judge sits, and there on the throne is the judge.

And you know who the judge is? You know  what he sees on the throne? A lamb who was slain. What? Jesus Christ is the judge who was judged.

Jesus Christ is the judge who came to earth and was judged on the cross. He was cut off. And when you believe in him, that means that judgment days passed for you. You've already been  through it in him. You already received your sentence, but he took it.

He bore it. And now there's  nothing for you, but Romans 8.1. Now there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. And you know what this means. You're not a relativist or a moralist, are you?

You know why? If  you're a Christian, on the one hand, you're not a relativist. You know the law is important. It's  so important that Jesus had to die on the cross. The law is so important Jesus had to die on the cross.

So you're not a relativist, but you're not a moralist anymore because you're not relying on the  law. You're relying on him. And now you obey the law out of gratitude, just to please the one  who did all this for you, but without the fear, without the inner going back and forth between  superiority and inferiority. You have a new heart. You have a desire to live the righteous life.

But out of gratitude, you don't look down at anybody who's not living the life the right way,  because you know you're a sinner saved by grace. But on the other hand, you absolutely know  it's crucial to obey God and to please him. You're not a moralist, you're not a relativist,  you are a Christian. Why? Because if there is a divine judge, what hope is there for you?

And if  there is no divine judge, what hope is there for the world? But in Jesus Christ, the judge who was  judged, we have hope. Let's pray. Our Father, we thank you that you have shown us the basis for  our moral convictions. But we don't just need a God in general.

We need a God who came to Earth  in Jesus Christ and died on the cross for us. And because you did, we're not a relativist, we're  not moralists. We can talk to people about these moral truths knowing that in their hearts they know,  but at the same time, they don't crush us, we're not afraid of them. Because in Jesus Christ,  you took the curse that we deserve so that now you can be just in just a fire of those who believe,  and we can live not moralistic or relativistic lives. But law abiding, joyful lives.

Father,  the wisdom of this overwhelms us, help us to apply it to our lives by your Holy Spirit. We pray in  Jesus' name, amen. Again, it's all at gospelandlife.com.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today doesn't believe everybody's equal human rights. So, if you believe in human rights, do you realize what that is? It's a belief. It's a belief. And it's essentially the same as a religious belief, even though you don't call it a religious  belief, because it's a belief about human nature and about what life is about, and it's  not something you can prove, and it's not self-evident to everybody, so it's a belief.

And you see how unfair it is to say, those of you who call your beliefs religious, you  have to keep them private, and those of us who don't, we can do anything we want with  them. It's just completely unfair. But now we're still back to where we said we were, which is a question. How do we avoid just not shouting at each other? This is the right standard for right and wrong.

No, this is the standard for right and wrong, and we just yell at each other. But maybe one of the ways we can calm each other down, and maybe make for more civil  conversation, is to ask this more fundamental question, where do you get your moral convictions  about what is right and wrong, like human rights? Where do you get your moral convictions? What do you base them on? How do you determine what is right and wrong?

And the reason that's a great question is it slows everybody down, because actually we  all have very strong moral convictions about what we think is right and wrong. But as soon as you say, well, why do you believe that? On what basis do you believe that? Where do you get that? Right away, we're not as quick to know what to say.

And so it makes us stop and think and talk, and therefore we suddenly have a better conversation,  a better public conversation. Now I would say that there's almost no place I know that has a more interesting and  ingenious and creative answer to the question, where do you get your moral beliefs? Then Romans chapter 2. And here I st. Paul, this last part of Romans chapter 2, is going to tell us three things.

The first paragraph, which is 12 to 16, there, Paul is telling us, no one can succeed  in being a relativist. The second paragraph, verses 17 to 24, there, Paul's thesis is, but on the other hand,  no one really can succeed in being a moralist. And then the last part of the passage is where Paul says, therefore, this is our only  hope. No one can succeed in being a relativist. No one can really succeed in being a moralist.

And therefore this is our only hope. Let's look at these three things. First of all, no one can succeed in being a relativist. Now, verse 12, all who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and  all who sin under the law will be judged by the law. Now who is he talking about?

He's talking about the law. He means by the law, the moral law of God that's revealed in the Bible in the scriptures. Of course, at the time, Paul was talking about the Old Testament, but in the scriptures. And he was saying, some people have that. That is to say, they believe it.

They believe that the moral law of God is revealed in the Bible, and they accept it,  and they embrace it, and they take it. But there's other people who don't have it. That is they either have never heard of it, they never read the Bible, they didn't even  know about it, or they don't accept it. Now in that day, most of the people who believed that the Bible was where the revealed moral  law was were Jews, but not all, of course not. There were Gentiles who believed that too, but there were mainly Jews, so what Paul was  trying to say is some people accept the moral law of God is revealed in the Bible, some people  who did not.

That's the people who have the law and people who don't. So what does he say about them? He says three things, one of which is interesting, one of which is startling, and one of which  is radical and controversial. It's in verse 1415. Indeed, when Gentiles who do not have the law, due by nature things required by the law,  there are law for themselves, even though they do not have the law, they show that the  requirements of the law are written on their hearts.

Their conscience is also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them  in other times, even defending them. Now here's what he's saying. Here's the interesting thing. All who's sent apart from the law will perish apart from the law, those who are sent  under the law will be judged by the law. The Gentiles who don't have the law still show that they are all on to themselves.

Now the first thing he's saying, which is interesting, is that God, the judge, will not judge  you according to standards you don't accept. If you don't accept the Bible as your moral standard, then you won't be judged according  to the Bible. You'll be judged according to the moral standards that you yourself have. And therefore, what he's saying is, no one's going to be judged by any state moral standards  that they don't accept, themselves, and embraced during their lives. Interesting.

I told you it was interesting, right? Okay. Secondly, he says something else which is more startling. And that is that even if you don't have the Bible as your moral standard, you see what  he sneaks it in. In the very beginning of verse 12, you're still going to perish on judgment day.

See, all who's sent apart from the law will still perish. Why? Because in your heart, you still do know something about the moral law, and you'll be judged  according to that. Now the thing that helped me, the illustration that helped me more than anything when I was  a young Christian, I read a book by Francis Schaeffer who was talking about Romans 2 and he  used an illustration, which of course is a bit fanciful, but basically gets the idea  across. Some of you have heard me use it before because it's so helpful to me.

He says, when it says that God is not going to judge you according to any standard other  than your own, that you already know, it's a little bit like this. He says, it's like when you're born, God puts an invisible recorder around your neck. It's not only invisible, of course, you can't feel it either or hear it. And all it does is record things you say to other people that they ought to do. All it does is pick up your own standards, your own moral standards.

So anytime you say you ought to do this or you should do this, it's picking up your moral  standards. So that on judgment day, you show up at judgment day and you're already upset because  you didn't know there was going to be one, so there you are. And it's as this. It's as if. It's a little fanciful.

It still gets across the idea. This is how the old straight should go. So there you are. I'm going to check out judgment day. But guy says, hey, hey, hey, calm down.

I'm a fair guy. I'm only going to judge you according to your own standards. And so he takes the little recorder off your neck. He says, I didn't know that was there. No, it was invisible.

And he puts it down and he says, I'm just going to judge you by your own standards and you're  going to play it. And see what Paul is saying and what you know in your own heart, I hope. There's nobody on the face of the earth. There's no one in the history of the world that will be able to stand. We'll be able to pass that standard on judgment day.

Nobody will. Just nobody has ever lived up to their own standards that they have imposed on other  people. No one. So the first thing is God is very fair. He's the judge of all the earth.

That's what Paul is saying. But it's very fair. He won't judge you according to anything that hasn't been a standard you don't already  have. But then secondly, on the other hand, no one's going to pass judgment day. And then thirdly, he says something very radical and controversial.

When he says, notice, he doesn't just say that people without the law of God have their  own moral standards. He says, indeed, when Gentiles who do not have the law, do by nature things required  by the law. What's the law? Well, it's what's in here. And notice, it doesn't say that people who don't believe in the Bible know in their hearts  and in their consciences everything in the Bible doesn't say that.

That would be silly. There's plenty of people out there who have never read the Bible, know anything about  the Bible. But what it does say, that deep in their hearts are deep in their consciences, there's  some things in the moral law of God that all people know because they've all been created  by God. And at a deep level, deep level, deep level, everyone has some understanding of the moral  law of God and that divinity is behind it. And everyone's living as if that's true.

And therefore, there's a sense in which no one is really a relativist. Now that's very, very controversial. But let me spend a moment trying to give you some of the evidence for this. One of the things I've always found fascinating is when I studied, over the years, when I  studied, especially the conversion accounts of very, very, very highly intellectual, intelligent,  sophisticated academics or professors or thinkers who were skeptical or atheists or  agnostics and were converted to Christianity. It's very interesting that when I study those kinds of people, very seldom do they come  to faith in Christ through some kind of complete, by looking at the arguments for the existence  of God or the evidence for the resurrection and they say, ah, I see the evidence is that  this is true.

They don't look at it that way. Usually they come out like this. Usually I have seen, they realize that they're moral convictions, that they're moral  intuitions, that they feel very strongly, actually, assume the existence of God and they  just haven't been honest about it. And they come to realize that in their moral convictions and in their moral intuitions  they actually have sensed God. They've intuitive the existence of God.

They haven't wanted to admit it and now they do. And that's how they become Christians. It's amazing how often that happens. You say, how does that work? Well, let me give you three examples, one of which is not a conversion.

In fact, what I'm about to give you is a little summary of a philosophy book, and please  be patient with it because even if you find it a little tough to follow, it's kind of fun,  but if you find it tough to follow, oh, immediately illustrate it and help you, you know, get  it down to earth. But recently there's been a book written by a man who's not a convert, who stays what  he would call an atheist or an agnostic, Tom Nagel, professor of philosophy NYU has recently  written a book that has created a firestorm because it's brilliantly argued, and yet at  the same time, let me just read you, the title is mind and cosmos, but the key is the subtitle. Ready for the subtitle? The subtitle is why the materialist, neo-darwinian conception of nature is almost certainly false. And let me give you the nub of it.

He's got one chapter in there called value, and here's what he basically says, evolutionary  materialism. By the way, he's not against evolution altogether, what he's saying is evolutionary materialism  is the idea that you are just a body, you're just a body, and there's nothing in you that  isn't there through natural selection. Something that's true about you is true because one of your ancestors had a trait that helped  them survive, and because that trait helped them survive, they've passed that down to you. So you're just a body, and everything in you is strictly the result of natural selection. It helped you answer to survive.

That's evolution in your materialism, now he says, that means, in that account of things,  that all your moral feelings are just that, their subjective feelings. Why, for example, he says, in this view, why do we all think that torture for fun is wrong? There's a lot of arguments about torture, but here's the point, don't we all believe  that torture just for fun is wrong, really, really wrong? And if you ever do find somebody, and there are people who we find that don't think torture  for fun is wrong, we consider them very sick. They can twist it.

So we all believe that torture for fun is wrong. Why do we believe that? And see, in the view of evolution or naturalism, it's a subjective belief, and you only believe  it because some of your ancestors felt that way, and that that feeling helped them survive,  and all the people who did enjoy torture for fun have not survived, probably because they  tortured each other and killed each other. We don't know why, but that's the point. What was the mechanism?

The point is that the reason we all believe that torture for fun is wrong is because  all the people who did feel that torture for fun was okay, they died out. And the reason you have the hair color you have is because of evolution, and the reason  you have the moral feeling that torture for fun is wrong is also because of evolution, and  they come from the same, your hair color, and that moral feeling come from the same place,  and they are in the same category. They're only subjective. All your moral feelings are subjectively, you feel those things are wrong subjectively because  they helped your ancestors survive, not because they are actually, objectively, universally,  and really wrong. They're subjectively wrong because you feel it, but not because they're actually and  objectively and universally and really wrong, but just subjective.

Now, what happens, though, suppose? It turns out that there's a tribe we've discovered in some remote part of the world that their  evolution operate in a very different way. First of all, their hair color is white from the minute they're born, and the pigment  of their skin is half red and half yellow, very different. But they also find torture for fun great, they love it, you know, it's a fun. Now they're starting to move out into the world, how do you feel about them?

Well, you say, well, okay, you know, they can't help their hair color and things like that,  but that torture for fun, that's wrong, well, why is it wrong? You feel it's wrong because of your evolution, they feel it's wrong, they feel it's okay  because of their evolution, why should their hair color and their practice of torture be  any, why should you differentiate? And here's what Tom Nagel says, nobody believes that torture for fun is only subjectively  wrong. We believe it's actually and objectively and universally and really wrong whether they  feel that way or not. So if evolutionary materialism is true, then value realism, the idea that things are actually  and really wrong can't be true, but since we know some things actually and really are  wrong evolutionary materialism can't be true.

Got that? See how easy that was? You say, that's just seemed like a sleight of hand, let me give you two personal examples. W. H.

Auden, one of the great poets in history, consider one of the great writers of the  20th century, W. H. Auden, like most British intellectuals of his time, abandoned any kind  of religious faith, abandoned Christian faith, he was an atheist or he was an agnostic  and that sort of thing. And then World War II happened and his understanding, his religionless belief was thrown into  a chaos and he came out of the other side of World War II, embracing Christianity which  shocked all of his many, many of his peers, but he explained it and here's how he explained  it. Let me set it up this way.

He had believed until World War II that basically all reasonable and lightened cultured  people would believe in human rights, they'd believe in freedom, they'd believe in democracy,  they'd believe in justice for everybody. But suddenly, along comes Nazism and it's embraced by Germany and Germany is every bit as  cultured and it's sophisticated and educated, a society is Britain. You know, it's second and none, science and art and music and everything. And yet, they haven't, what Germany embraced a philosophy that did not believe in human  rights for all, did not believe in justice for all. And this is what Auden said to try to explain what happened to him.

Quote, if I'm convinced that the highly educated Nazis are wrong and that we highly educated  English are right, what is it that validates our values and invalidates theirs? The English intellectuals who now cry to heaven against the evil incarnated and Hitler  have no heaven to cry to because the whole trend of liberal thought has been to undermine  any faith in the absolute. Rather, it has tried to make reason to be the judge. Here's the problem, either we serve the unconditional absolute or some Hitlerian monster  will supply an iron convention based on reason to do evil by. Now here's what is going on, here's, do you hear what he's saying?

Ordnance saying, let's look at nature, okay, let's be science, let's look at nature,  what do we see? That's how nature operates. Oh, but then we turn around and say, well, we don't want strong races to oppress weak  races or strong nations to oppress weak nations, why? If the operational principle of nature is the strong eating the weak, what in the world  is wrong with strong nations oppressing and destroying weak nations? See, reason will find nothing wrong with injustice, with trampling on human rights.

And therefore, here's what he realized. It's possible without God to account for moral feeling. Social construction or evolutionary biology, we can say you have your moral feelings, but  it's impossible without God to believe in moral obligation. Do you hear this? Moral feeling means I subjectively feel this way.

Moral obligation is you have to do this whether you feel like it or not. Moral obligation. If there's no God, there is no moral obligation, there's only moral feelings. And here's what he said. If there's no God, then my moral obligation is imaginary, and I know moral obligation  is not imaginary, and therefore there must be a God.

And he'd been living that way all along, but he hadn't wanted to admit it. See? Romans 2. Looking at the clock, let me give you one more example. More recently, again, not a conversion story, but some years ago in the Chronicle of  Higher Education, I read a very interesting article by a woman who was a cultural  anthropologist.

She was a very, at a Northeastern university, she was a very respected academic, and she  was studying African, certain African societies, in which women were very oppressed. There was polygamy, there was female genital mutilation, and there were these things that  really bothered her very much. But she was a cultural anthropologist, and she had bought into the idea that there is  such a thing as moral feelings, but not moral obligation. She bought her understanding was, she was a skeptical, secular person, was that if you  have a moral feeling, it comes either because your culture has constructed that feeling in  you or because of biology. And so she began when she was there in Africa to sometimes push back against some of the  people in authority in those societies about how they were treating women, and basically  what the people in authority said was this, don't you lay your white Western individualistic  human rights thing on us, how dare you think that your cultures, values are right, and  ours are wrong.

What's right for us is right for us, and it infuriated her because she realized that she  had absolutely no way to answer. No way to answer, see? She had no basis for what Thomas Nagel calls value realism. She had no basis for moral obligation. So you could say I subjectively feel something's wrong, but I cannot say on any basis that  something is actually, objectively, universally or really wrong, but you know how she ends  this whole book, I mean the whole article, she says this, she says, in the end I unavoidably  believe that equal rights for women is universally true, even though I have no basis for it, so  I'm going to work for equal rights for women anyway.

See, in other words, what she's doing, she's coming really close, really close to admitting  what Paul is saying, but not she just won't go all the way, she just won't go there, but  here's the question, if you're premise, that there is no God, and therefore no moral obligation,  leads you to a conclusion that you know isn't true, which is namely there's really nothing  wrong with oppressing women in Africa, why not change your premise? Why not change your premise? So you see, it's impossible to really succeed in being a relativist, however, on the  other hand, paragraph two, and I'm giving you less time because in some ways we've covered  this and we will cover this, the next paragraph is, now you who call yourself a Jew, if you  rely on the law, now he turns to people who say, okay, I do believe the Bible, I absolutely  believe the Bible, and I accept the Bible, and I'm living according to the Bible, now we can  call those people moralists, they're not relativists, they believe in morality, and they're  living on the basis of morality, and they say I'm going to honor God, and I'm going to  obey his law, but let's not forget what Paul's already said, you're going to have no more  hope on judgment day than the relativist, you're just more consistent, I'm not sure it's  going to be a great deal of consolation. Now, why is that true? Why is it also impossible to succeed in being a moralist?

Well, the answer  is down here in 21 and 22 and 23, basically, you then who teach others, do you not teach  yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal? You who say people should commit  adultery, not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? You who boast in the law?

Do you dishonor God by breaking the law? Now, if you look carefully,  he's giving you two reasons why no moralist will stand on judgment day either. The relativist  won't, they'll find out that they didn't live up to what they did know, but the moralist  won't either. Why not? One, hypocrisy, two, idolatry.

Hypocrisy, we all kind of know about. The fact is that if they're very high standards in here, and nobody lives up to them, now Paul  gives some obvious examples of hypocrisy. I mean, I don't know, I don't know of any Christian  church anywhere where everybody believes they'll shout not commit adultery, and there isn't  still adultery. Or everybody says they'll shout not steal, they'll shout not bear false witness,  and yet there's lying, and there's stealing, and there's embezzling. So he's on the one hand,  he's saying, first of all, there's hypocrisy.

The fact is that none of us live up. But then there's  idolatry. Now, it kind of sneaks in there, and it's actually a bit of a puzzle,  except when you ask commentators what this means, they usually all say the same thing. Notice,  it says, he's talking to Jews now. Remember, he starts in verse 17.

Now you call yourself Jews,  who rely on the law. He says, do you not commit adultery? Then he says, you who abhor idols, do you  rob temples? Now, this has always been a puzzle, because there seems to be no evidence that Jews,  rob temples. He's writing to Jews in Rome, right?

He's saying, well, you know, you Jews in Rome  should stop at night going in robbing temples and getting the idols and bringing them home. Jews  didn't do that. So he's speaking metaphorically. If he's obviously not speaking literally,  and metaphorically, as we often point out, the Bible says, it's one thing to say, I believe in God,  I'm living for God, when actually you're living for money, or you're living for power, or you're  living for status. And at this point, I think what Paul is trying to show us is what I would call the  terrible inwardness of the law.

Terrible? Yes. When Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount expounds the  law, he shows the terrible inwardness of it. You know how he says, you've heard it said, they'll  show not kill, but I say you shouldn't even resent your neighbor. You've heard it said, they'll  show not committed adultery.

You shouldn't love, but I say don't lust. You've heard it said, see,  what Jesus is showing is the law when it forbids a behavior is also in joining the opposite  and calling for a spirit. So for example, where does murder come from? Murder comes from resentment  that's nurtured and nurtured and fertilized and eventually becomes murder, right? Well, he says,  then you ought to realize that all of you have resentment, and most people don't murder, but  everybody resents, and what is that?

It's murder in seed form. And so when the Bible says,  they'll show not kill, it means you should love with your whole heart and not resent. When the  Bible says they'll show not steal, it means you should never envy and also be incredibly generous. When the Bible says there should not commit adultery, it means you should be totally faithful and  chased. And when Jesus is expounding the sermon on the Mount, you realize, oh my word, nobody  lives up to this.

And yet we want other people to live up to this. I've forgotten the name of the  label. There was a woman who was taught English at some conference. No, no, she taught English at a  public university somewhere. She was a believer, but it was a public university, and she, one time,  had her class read the sermon on the Mount.

Most of them hadn't ever read it before. Some of them  hadn't heard of it. And what was interesting, they wrote response papers, and most of them hated it,  utterly hated it. If I remember the article when something like this, most of them said,  I did not like the sermon on the Mount. It made me feel very guilty.

And you know why? And one  person said, I did not like the sermon on the Mount because nobody can live like this. But here's the hypocrisy. Would you like to live in a place where people serve your needs  ahead of their own? Would you like to live in a place where people are absolutely honest and  transparent, and they never hide anything from you, and they always keep their promises?

See, in other words, we want to live in a society of people who act the way the sermon on the  Mount dictates, but we don't ourselves want to be held up to that standard because we feel, oh,  that's awful. I did not like the sermon on the Mount. It made me feel very bad. David Martin  Lloyd Jones, in his sermons on the sermon on the Mount, he says, anybody who's really read the  sermon on the Mount will not say how wonderful. They'll say, God saved me from the sermon on the Mount.

Because you see the hypocrisy, we want people to act like this, but we don't want to be held  to it ourselves. That's hypocrisy, and it will be condemned on the last day. It'll be condemned  on the last day. So what's our hope? Is there any hope?

Oh, my goodness. See, if there is no  divine judge, if there really is no God, there's no divine judge, what hope is there for the world? What hope is there that all the injustices and the terrible things that are happening will ever  be put right? What hope is there for even us to have a basis for trying to put things right? If there is no judge, if there is no divine judge, what hope is there for the world?

But if there  is a divine judge, what hope is there for me and you? Hmm, we're stuck. Thank God for 0.3s. Because 0.3 brings us to the very end, and in the very end there's this very strange  discussion about a strange thing for most of us today, which is circumcision, but the heart of  the heart of it is right here in verse 28. A person is not a Jew who is one outwardly,  nor is circumcised physically.

Now, a person is a true Jew, basically what he's saying, who is one  inwardly and who has the circumcision of the heart by the spirit. And what he's saying is the  only hope is a new heart. Circumcision of the heart means the new birth. It means a new heart,  a new inward heart. Now, how does that work?

Why? Why? What is he talking about? Well, first of all,  let's talk about circumcision for a second. This whole area, this whole section is about circumcision.

And in the Old Testament, circumcision was the right R-I-T-E by which in the Old Testament,  a family showed that they were in a covenant relationship with God. And it's how the Israelites  showed they were in a covenant relationship with God. It was the sign that they were in a relationship  with God. They were obeying God and they were following His law. So, when all the males of the  particular family were circumcised, that said, we are under the law of God and we are obeying God  and we are following God.

That's what it, but there's a problem. What's the problem? Well, the problem was  verse 17. Now, you who call yourselves Jews, if you rely on the law and boast in God and then he  goes on to talk about all the problems. Now, here's the issue.

Law reliant. See, there's no problem  with being law abiding. That's good. But what's law reliant? It's not the same as law abiding.

Law reliant makes you boast. I have a relationship with God. Why? Because I'm a good person. I'm a  decent person.

I don't do this bad thing and that bad thing. I do these things and these things and  I'm a good person. And see, law reliant screws you up so much inwardly. You know why? You're always  going back and forth between superiority and inferiority.

See, on the one hand, deep inside, we know  like those students who read the sermon on the Mount, we know we're not living it up. We're not  living up to what it should be done. We know we're not what we should be. And so, when you're law  relying and when you're saying, I'm obeying the God, God's law, and I'm trying to be moral in that  way, then I know God will bless me and he will take me to heaven. If you're law reliant like that,  on the one hand, you're always struggling with inferiority and guilt and shame and you're very,  you know, you're very sensitive to criticism and you're always feeling a little bit like a failure  or sometimes you're feeling very superior because you've done this and you've done this,  and then it makes you self-righteous and it makes you fairer-cycle.

You're going back and forth  between superiority and inferiority. There's always this churn. It does not make you a nice person. And there's always this kind of inward churn and a lack of rest and a lack of peace and it back and  forth. See, you need something.

You need something in there that you don't have. What is the solution? The solution's a new heart. And how do you get a new heart? Circumcision of heart.

It can only happen  obviously by not relying on the law. Well, what do you rely on? Here's what you rely on. Why was circumcision used as a sign? Anybody know?

It was a symbol of the punishment or the curse  of the covenant. I don't know if any of you remember there's a place in Genesis where  God, Abraham, makes a covenant with God in Genesis 15, and he cuts some animals in half  and he puts them on both sides. And the reason why he did that was in ancient times we know,  two thousand years ago, one of the ways that covenants were made between people was you cut an  animal in half and you walk between the pieces and you took your vow. You didn't sign a document  like we do now. You cut an animal in half and walk between the pieces.

Why? Because you were saying,  if I don't do everything that I'm saying today, may I be cut into pieces? You're acting out the  curse of the covenant. You're acting out the punishment for disobedience and oath breaking. So circumcision was like that because circumcision is bloody, it's icky and it means being cut off.

And what God was saying is if you take the law on and you say, yes, I'm going to come under the  law and I'm going to make this my guy, but you don't follow law, then the curse of the covenant  is to be cut off from me. And honestly, if you think, oh, this is all kind of weird and kind of  nasty, listen, you do it yourself. If someone's in a relationship with you and they can repeatedly  violate you, repeatedly go against your wishes, repeatedly break promises to you, repeatedly do  things you've asked them not to do. What do you do at a certain point? You say, I'm sorry, we can't  be friends anymore.

What are you doing? You're cutting them off. It's absolutely natural. And so circumcision is cutting off and it was the curse of the covenant. If you bring on,  if you come in and you say, I'm going to obey God's commands and then you don't do it, you're cut off.

So what hope is there for us? Because on judgment day, we're all going to be cut off and here's the  answer. The Bible says something really amazing about circumcision. Paul says it in Colossians 2, he says  this in Colossians 2 verses 11 and 12, he says, in Christ, you were circumcised. Now he's talking to  everybody, by the way, he's talking to male male and female Christian believers.

Listen, he says,  in him, you were circumcised, not with a circumcision done by the hands of men, but in the circumcision of  Christ. Now that's saying two astounding things. The first thing is that when Jesus Christ went to  the cross, he was actually being circumcised. You say, what? Yes.

It was bloody. There was a sword  and he was being cut off. When he said, my God, my God, why has that but forsaken me? He was being cut  off. Jesus Christ was the only human being who ever actually fulfilled the law.

He loved God with all  of his heart, soul and strength in mind. He loved his neighbor as himself. He loved people. He was  honest. He fulfilled the law.

His life is just a thing of beauty. When you read about it in the  gospels, there's a thing of beauty. And yet at the end of his life, he was cut off. It says in Isaiah 53,  he talks about the suffering servant who's going to come and take our transgressions upon us. It says  he was cut off from the land of the living.

He did it for us. He took the curse that we should have. And the second incredible thing Paul says is therefore in him, you are the circumcision. Now  you're saying that to male and female, by the way, interesting. All Christians, what does that mean?

It means you've already been through judgment day. In Jesus Christ, you've been through judgment day. If you believe in him, if you say father, accept me because of what Jesus has done,  he's already been through judgment day. I think there is no more astounding  picture in the Bible than the end of the book of Revelation. Not the very end, but in the book of  Revelation, the end of the Bible, where John, the apostle, gets his vision of judgment day,  and he sees everyone assembled before the throne, and there's the throne, and the throne is where  the judge sits, and there on the throne is the judge.

And you know who the judge is? You know  what he sees on the throne? A lamb who was slain. What? Jesus Christ is the judge who was judged.

Jesus Christ is the judge who came to earth and was judged on the cross. He was cut off. And when you believe in him, that means that judgment days passed for you. You've already been  through it in him. You already received your sentence, but he took it.

He bore it. And now there's  nothing for you, but Romans 8.1. Now there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. And you know what this means. You're not a relativist or a moralist, are you?

You know why? If  you're a Christian, on the one hand, you're not a relativist. You know the law is important. It's  so important that Jesus had to die on the cross. The law is so important Jesus had to die on the cross.

So you're not a relativist, but you're not a moralist anymore because you're not relying on the  law. You're relying on him. And now you obey the law out of gratitude, just to please the one  who did all this for you, but without the fear, without the inner going back and forth between  superiority and inferiority. You have a new heart. You have a desire to live the righteous life.

But out of gratitude, you don't look down at anybody who's not living the life the right way,  because you know you're a sinner saved by grace. But on the other hand, you absolutely know  it's crucial to obey God and to please him. You're not a moralist, you're not a relativist,  you are a Christian. Why? Because if there is a divine judge, what hope is there for you?

And if  there is no divine judge, what hope is there for the world? But in Jesus Christ, the judge who was  judged, we have hope. Let's pray. Our Father, we thank you that you have shown us the basis for  our moral convictions. But we don't just need a God in general.

We need a God who came to Earth  in Jesus Christ and died on the cross for us. And because you did, we're not a relativist, we're  not moralists. We can talk to people about these moral truths knowing that in their hearts they know,  but at the same time, they don't crush us, we're not afraid of them. Because in Jesus Christ,  you took the curse that we deserve so that now you can be just in just a fire of those who believe,  and we can live not moralistic or relativistic lives. But law abiding, joyful lives.

Father,  the wisdom of this overwhelms us, help us to apply it to our lives by your Holy Spirit. We pray in  Jesus' name, amen. Again, it's all at gospelandlife.com.

### 中文翻译

当今世界并不认为每个人都拥有平等的、人类的权利。所以，如果你相信人权，你意识到那是什么吗？那是一种信念。一种信念。而且它本质上与宗教信念是一样的——即便你不把它称为宗教信念——因为它是关于人性的信念、关于人生意义的信念；它不是你能证明出来的东西，也不是对每个人都不言自明的，所以它是一种信念。

你会发现，说“你们这些把自己的信念称为宗教的人，必须把它们私下里藏起来；而我们这些不把自己的信念称为宗教的人，就可以随心所欲地拿它们做任何事”，这是多么不公平。这完全不公平。

但我们又回到了我们刚才说的那个位置：问题仍然是，怎样才能避免彼此对着喊？“这是对与错的正确标准！”

“不，这是对与错的标准！”于是我们就只是互相吼叫。

不过，也许有一种方式可以让我们彼此冷静下来，也许能让对话更文明一些：去问一个更基础的问题——你对“什么是对、什么是错”（比如人权）那些道德确信从哪里来？你的道德确信从哪里来？你把它建立在什么之上？你如何判定什么是对、什么是错？

之所以这是一个很棒的问题，是因为它会让每个人都慢下来。事实上，我们都对自己认为对错的事情有非常强烈的道德确信。但当你一问：“那你为什么相信这个？你依据什么相信这个？你从哪里得来这个？”我们立刻就没那么快知道该说什么了。

于是，这迫使我们停下来思考、交流，因此我们突然就会拥有更好的对话、更好的公共对话。

我会说，我几乎不知道还有哪里能像《罗马书》第二章那样，对“你的道德信念从哪里来？”这个问题给出如此有趣、巧妙、富有创造力的回答。在这里，使徒保罗在《罗马书》第二章的后半部分要告诉我们三件事。

第一段（12–16节）里，保罗告诉我们：没有人能成功做一个相对主义者。

第二段（17–24节）里，保罗的论点是：但另一方面，没有人真的能成功做一个道德主义者。

而在经文的最后一部分，保罗说：因此，这就是我们唯一的盼望。没有人能成功做相对主义者；没有人真的能成功做道德主义者。因此，这就是我们唯一的盼望。

让我们来看这三件事。

第一，没有人能成功做一个相对主义者。

第12节说：“凡没有律法犯了罪的，也必不按律法灭亡；凡在律法以下犯了罪的，也必按律法受审判。”他在说谁？

他在说“律法”。他所说的“律法”是指上帝在圣经里启示的道德律法。当然，在保罗写作的时候，他所指的是旧约，但总之是指圣经中启示出来的道德律。

他在说：有些人“有”这个律法——也就是说，他们相信它。他们相信上帝的道德律法是在圣经里启示的，他们接受它、拥抱它、领受它。

但还有些人“没有”它——也就是说，他们要么从未听过，要么从未读过圣经，甚至根本不知道；或者他们不接受它。

在当时，大多数相信“圣经是启示性道德律所在”的人是犹太人，但当然并非全部。也有外邦人相信这一点，不过主要还是犹太人。因此保罗想说的是：有些人接受“上帝的道德律在圣经里启示”，也有些人不接受。

这就是“有律法的人”和“没有律法的人”。

那么保罗对他们说了什么？他说了三件事：其中一件很有意思，一件令人震惊，一件激进而且极具争议。它在第14–15节：

“没有律法的外邦人若顺着本性行律法上的事，他们虽然没有律法，自己就是自己的律法。这是显出律法的功用刻在他们心里，他们是非之心同作见证，并且他们的思念互相较量，或以为是，或以为非。”

这就是他的意思。

先说那件“有意思”的事。第12节说：在律法之外犯罪的人，也会在律法之外灭亡；在律法之下犯罪的人，会按律法受审判。没有律法的外邦人仍然显明他们“自己就是自己的律法”。

他所说的第一件有意思的事是：上帝这位审判者，不会按你不接受的标准来审判你。如果你不把圣经当作你的道德标准，那么你不会按圣经受审判；你会按你自己所持有的道德标准受审判。因此他说：没有人会按自己在一生中并不接受、也不认同的国家道德标准而受审判。有意思吧？

我说了它很有意思，对吧？好。

第二件事更令人震惊：即便你没有把圣经作为你的道德标准——你看他是怎么“顺便塞进来”的——在第12节一开始就说：你在审判日仍然要灭亡。

看哪：“凡没有律法犯了罪的，也必不按律法灭亡。”为什么？因为在你心里，你仍然知道一些关于道德律法的东西，你会按那一点点来受审判。

有一幅比任何东西都更帮助我的图画，是我年轻作基督徒时读到的。那时我读了弗朗西斯·薛华（Francis Schaeffer）的一本书，他谈到《罗马书》第二章，用了一个比喻——当然有点夸张——但基本把意思讲得很清楚。我以前也用过这个比喻，你们当中有些人可能听过，因为它对我太有帮助了。

他说：当经文说上帝不会按任何其他标准来审判你，只会按你自己已经知道的标准来审判你，这有点像这样：他说，就好像你出生的时候，上帝在你脖子上挂了一个看不见的录音机。不但看不见，你当然也摸不着、听不见。它所做的只有一件事：把你对别人说“你应该这样做”“你应当那样做”的话都录下来。它只会记录你自己的标准、你自己的道德标准。

所以每当你说“你应该做这个”“你不该做那个”，它就在记录你的道德标准。

于是到了审判日，你来到那里，而且你已经很生气，因为你根本不知道会有审判日——但你人就在那儿了。这只是个比喻，是“仿佛如此”，有点夸张，但它把意思带出来了。

故事大概是这样：你到了审判日，正要抗议；但上帝说：“嘿，嘿，嘿，冷静点。我很公平。我只按你自己的标准来审判你。”

于是他把你脖子上那个小录音机取下来，你说：“我不知道那里还有这个。”他说：“当然不知道，它是看不见的。”

他把它放下，说：“我只按你自己的标准审判你。”然后把录音放出来。

你看保罗所说的、以及我希望你在自己心里也知道的是什么：地上没有一个人，历史上没有一个人，能够在审判日站立得住，能够通过那个标准。

没有人能。就是从来没有一个人真正活出过自己强加给别人的那些标准。没有一个。

所以第一件事是：上帝非常公平。他是全地的审判者。这就是保罗所说的：他很公平。他不会按你从来没有、并且你不接受的标准来审判你。

但第二件事是：另一方面，没有人能通过审判日。

第三件事，他说了一句非常激进、也很有争议的话。

注意，他不仅仅说：没有上帝律法的人也有自己的道德标准。他说：“外邦人虽然没有律法，却顺着本性行律法上的事。”律法是什么？就是这里所说的。

注意，经文并不是说：那些不信圣经的人在心里、在良心里知道圣经里的一切——那当然很荒唐。外面有很多人从没读过圣经，也不知道圣经是什么。

但经文确实说：在他们内心深处、在他们良心深处，有些属于上帝道德律法的内容是所有人都知道的，因为所有人都是上帝所造。在很深、很深、很深的层面上，每个人对上帝的道德律、以及其背后有神性支撑，都有某种理解；而且每个人都在某种程度上“好像这是真的”那样活着。

因此，从某种意义上说，没有人真的是相对主义者。

这当然非常、非常有争议。但让我花一点时间，给你一些证据。

我一直觉得很有意思的一件事，是我这些年研究——尤其是研究那些极其聪明、理性、成熟的学者、教授、思想家的归信经历：他们原本是怀疑论者、无神论者或不可知论者，后来却归信了基督教。非常有意思的是，当我研究这些人时，他们很少是因为某种“完整的推理链条”——看了上帝存在的论证或复活的证据——然后说：“啊，我看到证据表明这是真的。”他们通常不是这样看的。

他们更常见的路径是这样：他们意识到自己非常强烈的道德确信、道德直觉，其实预设了上帝的存在，只是他们一直不愿诚实面对。他们逐渐意识到：在自己的道德确信和道德直觉里，他们其实已经感知到上帝；他们直觉到上帝存在，只是他们不想承认，而现在他们承认了。于是他们成为基督徒。

这种情况发生得惊人地频繁。

你会说：这怎么可能？我给你三个例子，其中一个还不是归信故事。

事实上，我接下来要做的是简要概述一本哲学书。请你耐心一点：即便你觉得有点难跟上，它其实挺有趣；如果你觉得难，我马上会用例子把它具体化，让它“落到地上”。

最近有一本书，是一位并没有归信、仍自称无神论者或不可知论者的人写的——汤姆·内格尔（Tom Nagel），纽约大学哲学教授。他最近写了一本书，引发了巨大争议，因为论证非常精彩。但与此同时，让我读给你听：书名叫《心灵与宇宙》（Mind and Cosmos），关键在副标题。准备好了吗？副标题是：“为什么唯物主义的、新达尔文主义的自然观几乎可以肯定是错误的。”

我把核心讲给你。

书里有一章叫“价值”（Value），他基本上是这么说的：所谓“进化的唯物主义”，顺便说，他并不完全反对进化；他要反对的是“进化的唯物主义”——也就是认为你不过是一具身体，你只是身体；你里面没有任何不是通过自然选择而来的东西。你身上某个真实的特征之所以存在，是因为你的某个祖先有一种特质帮助他们生存；因为那特质帮助他们活下来，就遗传给了你。

所以你只是身体，你里面的一切都严格是自然选择的结果——它帮助你或你的祖先生存。

这就是“进化的唯物主义”。而他说：这样一来，在这个解释框架里，你所有的道德感受也就只是“感受”，是主观感受。

例如，他说：在这种观点下，我们为什么都认为“为了取乐而施加酷刑”是错的？关于酷刑有很多争论，但关键在这里：我们不都相信“只是为了好玩而折磨人”是错的吗？非常、非常错？

如果你真的发现有人——而我们确实会发现一些人——不认为“为了取乐而施酷刑”是错的，我们会觉得他们病得很重。他们会扭曲。

所以我们都相信“为了取乐而施酷刑”是错的。我们为什么相信这一点？

在进化或自然主义的观点里，这是一种主观信念；你之所以相信它，只是因为你的某些祖先有这种感受，而这种感受帮助他们生存；而那些确实享受为了取乐而施酷刑的人，可能都没能存活下来——也许因为他们互相折磨、互相杀害。我们不知道具体机制是什么，但重点在这里。

重点是：我们之所以都认为“为了取乐而施酷刑”是错的，是因为所有认为那样“可以”的人都灭绝了。

你头发的颜色来自进化；你那种“为了取乐而施酷刑是错的”的道德感受也来自进化。它们来自同一个地方，属于同一类别：它们都只是主观的。

你所有的道德感受都是主观的——你主观地觉得这些事是错的，只是因为它们帮助你的祖先生存，而不是因为它们在客观上、普遍上、真实上就是错的。它们之所以“错”，只是因为你这样感觉，而不是因为它们真实地、客观地、普遍地就是错的——它们只是主观而已。

那么，假设发生一件事会怎样？

假设我们在世界某个偏远地区发现一个部落，他们的进化以一种非常不同的方式运作。首先，他们从出生起头发就是白色；皮肤的色素一半红、一半黄，非常不同。但他们还觉得“为了取乐而施酷刑”很棒，他们喜欢，你知道，他们觉得那很好玩。现在他们开始向世界各地迁移，你对他们感觉如何？

你会说：“好吧，他们的头发颜色之类的，他们也没办法。”可是“为了取乐而施酷刑”，那是错的。那为什么是错的？你觉得它错，是因为你的进化；他们觉得它没问题，是因为他们的进化。那为什么他们的头发颜色和他们施酷刑的做法，你要区别对待？你凭什么区分？

汤姆·内格尔说：没有人相信“为了取乐而施酷刑”只是主观上错。我们相信：无论他们感觉如何，那在客观上、普遍上、真实上都是错的。

所以，如果进化的唯物主义是真的，那么“价值实在论”（value realism，即某些事情确实、真实地就是错的）就不可能是真的；但既然我们知道有些事确实、真实地就是错的，那么进化的唯物主义就不可能是真的。

明白了吗？看，多简单！

你会说：“这听起来像是一种障眼法。”那我给你两个个人例子。

W. H. 奥登（W. H. Auden）是历史上伟大的诗人之一，被认为是二十世纪最伟大的作家之一。奥登像他那个时代大多数英国知识分子一样，放弃了任何宗教信仰，放弃了基督教信仰；他是无神论者或不可知论者之类。

后来二战发生了，他那种无宗教的信念世界被搅得一团糟。二战结束后，他反而拥抱了基督教，这震惊了他许许多多的同辈。但他解释了原因，他是这样解释的。让我先这样铺垫。

在二战之前，他一直以为：凡是理性、开明、有文化的人，基本都会相信人权、相信自由、相信民主、相信对每个人的公义。

可忽然，纳粹主义出现了，被德国拥抱；而德国在文化、成熟、教育程度上与英国不相上下。你知道，在科学、艺术、音乐等方面都是一流的。但德国却拥抱了一种哲学：不相信人人都有人权，也不相信对人人的公义。

奥登为了说明自己发生了什么，说了这样一段话：

> “如果我确信受过高等教育的纳粹是错的，而我们受过高等教育的英国人是对的，那么，是什么使我们的价值有效、并使他们的价值无效呢？如今对着希特勒所体现的邪恶向天呼喊的英国知识分子，并没有天可呼喊，因为自由主义思想的整个趋势一直在削弱对绝对者的任何信心；相反，它试图让理性成为审判官。问题在这里：要么我们侍奉那无条件的绝对者，要么就会有某个希特勒式的怪物，用理性为依据提供一种铁一般的惯例，让人据以作恶。”

这里发生了什么？你听见他在说什么吗？

奥登是在说：“让我们看自然吧，好吧，让我们科学一点，看自然；我们看见什么？自然就是这样运作的。”

可接着我们却转过头说：“我们不希望强大的种族压迫弱小的种族，不希望强大的国家压迫弱小的国家。”为什么？

如果自然运行的原则就是强者吃弱者，那么强国压迫并消灭弱国，到底哪里错了？

你看，理性本身找不到不公义、践踏人权有什么“错”。

因此，他意识到：没有上帝，你可以解释“道德感受”从哪里来——社会建构也好，进化生物学也好，我们都可以说你之所以有这些道德感受；但是没有上帝，你无法相信“道德义务”。听清楚了吗？

“道德感受”是：我主观上这样感觉。

“道德义务”是：无论你愿不愿意、感觉如何，你都必须这样做。

如果没有上帝，就没有道德义务，只有道德感受。

他的话是：如果没有上帝，那我的道德义务就是想象出来的；可我知道道德义务不是想象出来的；因此必定有上帝。

而他其实一直都在这样活着，只是不愿承认。看见了吗？这就是《罗马书》第二章。

看看时间，我再给你一个例子。

更近些年，这也不是归信故事。几年前我在《高等教育纪事报》（Chronicle of Higher Education）读到一篇很有意思的文章，作者是一位文化人类学家。

她在美国东北部某所大学任教，是很受尊敬的学者。她研究一些非洲社会，在那些社会里，女性被严重压迫：一夫多妻、女性割礼（割礼式的残割）等等。这些事让她非常困扰。

但她是文化人类学家，她接受了一种观念：有“道德感受”，但没有“道德义务”。她作为一个怀疑的、世俗的人所接受的理解是：如果你有一种道德感受，那要么是你的文化把这种感受建构在你里面，要么是生物学导致的。

于是，当她在非洲时，她有时会对那些社会中掌权的人如何对待女性提出反对。掌权的人基本这样回应她：“你别把你们白人、西方、个人主义的人权观念强加在我们身上！你凭什么认为你们文化的价值是对的、我们的就是错的？对我们来说对的就是对的。”

这让她非常愤怒，因为她意识到：她完全没有办法回答。完全没有办法回答。看见了吗？

她没有汤姆·内格尔所谓“价值实在论”的任何基础。她没有道德义务的基础。

因此，你可以说：“我主观上觉得这不对。”但你无法在任何基础上说：某件事在客观上、普遍上、真实上就是错的。

而你知道她怎样结束整篇文章吗？她说：“最终，我不可避免地相信：女性平等权利在普遍意义上是真的；尽管我没有任何基础来支持它，但我仍要为女性平等权利而努力。”

你看，也就是说，她已经非常、非常接近承认保罗在说什么了，但她就是不肯走到最后一步，她就是不肯去那里。

但问题是：如果你的前提——“没有上帝，因此没有道德义务”——把你带到一个你知道不是真的结论，也就是“在非洲压迫女性其实并没有什么真正的错”，那你为什么不改变你的前提？为什么不改变你的前提？

所以你看，真正成功做一个相对主义者是不可能的。

然而，另一方面，第二段——我会用更少的时间，因为某种意义上我们已经谈过，也还会谈到——下一段说：“你这称为犹太人的……”如果你倚靠律法……

现在他转向那些说：“好吧，我确实相信圣经；我绝对相信圣经；我接受圣经；我按圣经而活。”的人。我们可以称这些人为道德主义者；他们不是相对主义者，他们相信道德，并且以道德为基础生活；他们说：“我要尊荣上帝，我要遵守他的律法。”

但别忘了保罗已经说过什么：在审判日，你不会比相对主义者更有盼望；你只不过更一致一些。我不确定那会是多大的安慰。

那为什么会这样？为什么同样也不可能成功做一个道德主义者？

答案在第21、22、23节：

“你这教导别人、还不教导自己吗？你这讲说人不可偷窃、自己还偷窃吗？你这说人不可奸淫、自己还奸淫吗？你这厌恶偶像、自己还抢夺庙中之物吗？你这指着律法夸口、自己倒犯律法、羞辱上帝吗？”

如果你仔细看，他给了两个理由，说明道德主义者在审判日同样站立不住：相对主义者站不住，因为他们会发现自己没有活出自己所知道的；道德主义者也站不住。

为什么？第一，伪善；第二，偶像崇拜。

伪善我们都多少知道：圣经里的标准非常高，没有人活得出来。保罗给了一些显而易见的伪善例子。我是说，我不知道——我不知道世界上有哪间基督教会，大家都喊“不可奸淫”，却仍然没有奸淫；或者大家都说“不可偷盗”“不可作假见证”，却仍然有说谎、偷盗、侵吞。

所以他一方面是在说：第一，有伪善。事实是，我们没有一个人活得出来。

但还有偶像崇拜。它在这里有点“悄悄混进来”，实际上有点让人困惑；不过当你去问注释家这是什么意思时，他们通常都说同一件事。

注意这里：他现在是在对犹太人说。记得他从第17节开始：“你这称为犹太人的，倚靠律法……”

他说：“你不奸淫吗？”然后又说：“你厌恶偶像，还抢夺庙中之物吗？”

这一直让人困惑，因为似乎没有证据显示犹太人会去“抢夺庙中之物”。他写信给罗马的犹太人，对吧？他不可能是在说：“你们这些罗马的犹太人，晚上别再跑去抢庙、把偶像偷回家了。”犹太人不会那样做。

所以他是在用比喻。

既然显然不是字面意思，那在比喻意义上——我们常常指出——圣经说：一回事是你说“我信上帝，我为上帝而活”；但其实你是在为金钱而活、为权力而活、为地位而活。

在这里，我认为保罗要让我们看见我称之为“律法可怕的内向性”（terrible inwardness of the law）。

可怕？是的。

当耶稣在《登山宝训》中阐释律法时，他显明了律法那可怕的内向性。你知道他怎么说吗：“你们听见有话说：不可杀人；只是我告诉你们：连恨你的弟兄都不可。”你们听见有话说：不可奸淫；只是我告诉你们：连动淫念都不可。你们听见有话说……

耶稣在显明的是：律法禁止一种行为时，也同时命令相反的积极之事，并呼召一种内在的心灵。

比如说，谋杀从哪里来？谋杀从怨恨来——怨恨被不断滋养、不断发酵，最终就成为谋杀，对吧？所以耶稣说：你们应该明白，你们每个人都有怨恨；大多数人不会去杀人，但每个人都会怨恨。那是什么？那是“种子形态”的谋杀。

所以圣经说“不可杀人”，意思是你要全心去爱，不可怀怨。

圣经说“不可偷盗”，意思是你不可以嫉妒，并且要极其慷慨。

圣经说“不可奸淫”，意思是你要完全忠诚、纯洁。

当耶稣在《登山宝训》里阐释律法时，你会意识到：天哪，没有人能活到这个标准。

然而我们却希望别人活到这个标准。

我忘了那篇文章的题目。有一位女士在某个地方的公立大学教英语。她是信徒，但那是公立大学。有一次，她让班上的学生读《登山宝训》。大多数人以前从没读过，有些人甚至没听说过。

有意思的是，他们写了回应文章，而大多数人都讨厌它，极其讨厌。

如果我没记错，文章说大多数学生写道：“我不喜欢《登山宝训》。它让我觉得很内疚。”

你知道为什么吗？有人说：“我不喜欢《登山宝训》，因为没有人能这样活。”

但这就是伪善：你愿不愿意住在一个地方，在那里人们把你的需要放在自己之前来服事你？你愿不愿意住在一个地方，在那里人们绝对诚实、透明，从不对你隐藏任何事，总是守承诺？

也就是说，我们希望生活在一个社会里，人人都按《登山宝训》所要求的方式行事；但我们自己却不愿意被这样一个标准衡量，因为我们觉得：“哦，太可怕了。”

“我不喜欢《登山宝训》，它让我很难受。”

大卫·马丁·洛伊德-琼斯（David Martyn Lloyd-Jones）在他关于《登山宝训》的讲道里说：任何真正读过《登山宝训》的人，都不会说“多么美好”；他们会说：“上帝救我脱离《登山宝训》。”

因为你看见伪善：我们希望别人这样做，但我们不想自己被这样要求。这就是伪善，而在末日必被定罪，必被定罪。

那么我们的盼望是什么？还有盼望吗？

天哪。你看，如果没有一位神圣的审判者——如果真的没有上帝、没有神圣的审判——这个世界还有什么盼望？所有正在发生的不公义与可怕之事，还有什么盼望会被纠正？甚至我们要努力纠正这些事的根据又在哪里？如果没有审判者、没有神圣的审判者，这世界有什么盼望？

但如果有一位神圣的审判者，我和你又有什么盼望？嗯，我们被卡住了。

感谢上帝给了“0.3秒”。因为“0.3”把我们带到最后。在结尾处，有一段对我们今天大多数人来说很陌生、很奇怪的讨论：割礼。但其核心中的核心就在第28节：“因为外面作犹太人的，不是真犹太人；外面肉身的割礼，也不是真割礼。”

而真正的犹太人（他基本是在说）是里面作的；割礼是心里的割礼，是由圣灵而不是由字句。

他在说：唯一的盼望是一个新的心。“心里的割礼”就是重生，就是一颗新的心，一个新的内在之心。

这怎么发生？为什么？他到底在说什么？

首先，我们先谈一下割礼。这里这一整段都在讲割礼。

在旧约中，割礼是一种仪式（rite），借此一个家庭表明他们与上帝立约；以色列人也是这样表明他们与上帝立约。割礼是他们与上帝有关系的记号，表明他们顺服上帝、遵行他的律法。

所以，当一个家庭中所有男性都受了割礼，就表示：“我们在上帝的律法之下；我们顺服上帝；我们跟随上帝。”

但这里有个问题。问题是什么？问题就在第17节：“你这称为犹太人的，倚靠律法，指着上帝夸口……”然后他继续讲一连串问题。

关键在这里：“倚靠律法”（law reliant）。你看，守律法（law abiding）本身没有问题，那是好的。

但“倚靠律法”是什么？它与“遵行律法”不是一回事。

倚靠律法会让你夸口：我与上帝有关系。为什么？因为我是个好人，是个正派的人。

我不做这个坏事、不做那个坏事；我做这些事、那些事；所以我是个好人。

而“倚靠律法”会在你内心深处把你扭曲得很厉害。为什么？因为你总是在“优越感”和“自卑感”之间来回摇摆。

一方面，我们内心深处知道——就像那些读《登山宝训》的学生——我们并没有活出来；我们没有活到应该活的样子；我们不是我们应该成为的人。

所以，当你倚靠律法、说“我在遵行上帝的律法，我努力按道德生活，因此我知道上帝会祝福我、会带我进天堂”时，你一方面总在自卑、内疚、羞耻中挣扎；你会非常敏感于批评，总觉得自己有点失败。

但另一方面，有时你又会因为自己做了这个、做了那个而感到非常优越，于是你变得自义、变得像法利赛人。

你在优越与自卑之间来回摇摆，里面总在翻搅。这不会让你成为一个可爱的人。里面总有这种翻搅，没有安息，没有平安，来来回回。

你需要某样东西。你里面缺了某样东西。

解决是什么？解决是一颗新心。

那你怎么得着新心？“心里的割礼”。

它显然只能借着不再倚靠律法而发生。那你要倚靠什么？你要倚靠这个：

为什么割礼会被用作记号？有人知道吗？

它象征盟约的惩罚或咒诅。

我不知道你们当中是否有人记得《创世记》里的一段：在《创世记》15章，上帝与亚伯拉罕立约，亚伯拉罕把一些动物劈成两半，摆在两边。

他这么做是因为在古代——两千年前——人们立约的一种方式就是把动物劈开，然后从两半之间走过去，并起誓。你不像我们现在这样签文件；你把动物劈开，从中间走过去。

为什么？因为你是在说：“如果我今天所说的没有做到，愿我也被劈成两半。”你是在演示盟约的咒诅，演示违背誓言、违背盟约的惩罚。

割礼也是如此，因为割礼是流血的、令人不适的，它意味着“被切除”“被割断”。

上帝在说：如果你承担律法、说“是的，我要在律法之下，我要以此为我的指引”，但你却不遵行律法，那么盟约的咒诅就是从我那里被剪除。

坦白说，如果你觉得这很怪、很“恶心”，听着——你自己也会这样做。

如果有人与你有关系，却一次又一次地伤害你、一次又一次地违背你的心意、一次又一次地对你失信、一次又一次地做你明确要求他不要做的事，到某个时候你会怎么做？你会说：“对不起，我们不能再做朋友了。”

你在做什么？你是在把他“切断”。这是完全自然的。

所以割礼象征“切断”，它是盟约的咒诅：如果你说“我要遵守上帝的命令”，却又不去做，你就被剪除。

那么我们的盼望在哪里？因为在审判日，我们都要被剪除。

答案在这里：圣经对割礼说了一件非常惊人的事。保罗在《歌罗西书》第二章这样说（11–12节）：

“你们在他里面也受了割礼……”（注意，他是在对所有人说——男性和女性的基督徒信徒。）

“你们在他里面受了割礼，不是人手所行的割礼，乃是基督使你们脱去肉体情欲的割礼。”

这里说了两件令人震撼的事。

第一，当耶稣基督上十字架时，他实际上是在“受割礼”。你说：“什么？”是的。

那是流血的；有刀剑；他被切断。当他说：“我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？”他被剪除。

耶稣基督是唯一一个真正完全成全律法的人。他尽心、尽性、尽力、尽意爱神；他爱邻舍如同自己；他爱人；他诚实；他成全了律法。

他的生命是如此美丽。你读福音书的时候，会看见那种美丽。

然而在他生命的末了，他却被剪除。《以赛亚书》53章谈到那位将要来、替我们担当过犯的受苦仆人，说：“他从活人之地被剪除。”

他是为我们做的。他承担了我们本该承担的咒诅。

第二件保罗说的不可思议之事是：因此，在他里面，你就是“受割礼的人”。他是在对男人和女人都这样说——很有意思。所有基督徒都如此。这是什么意思？

意思是：你已经经历过审判日了。

在耶稣基督里，你已经经过审判日。如果你信他，如果你说：“父啊，因耶稣所做的接纳我”，那么他已经替你经历了审判日。

我想，圣经里没有比《启示录》末尾那幅图画更令人震撼的了——不是最后一节，而是在《启示录》这卷圣经结尾的书里，使徒约翰看到审判日的异象：他看见所有人聚集在宝座前，宝座是审判者坐的地方，而宝座上坐着审判者。

你知道审判者是谁吗？你知道他在宝座上看见什么吗？

是一只被杀的羔羊。

什么？耶稣基督是那位“审判人的审判者”，却也是“被审判的审判者”。

耶稣基督是那位来到地上、在十字架上受审判的审判者。他被剪除。

当你信他时，就意味着：审判日对你已经过去了。你已经在他里面经历过了。你已经领受了你的判决，但他替你承担了。

他背负了。

因此，对你而言，只剩下《罗马书》8章1节：“如今那些在基督耶稣里的，就不定罪了。”

你知道这意味着什么：你既不是相对主义者，也不是道德主义者，对吧？

为什么？如果你是基督徒，一方面你不是相对主义者：你知道律法很重要——重要到耶稣必须为它死在十字架上。律法重要到耶稣必须死。

所以你不是相对主义者。

但你也不再是道德主义者，因为你不再倚靠律法，你倚靠他。

现在你遵行律法，是出于感恩，只为讨那位为你做了这一切的主喜悦；而且不再带着恐惧，不再在内心优越与自卑之间来回摆荡。

你有一颗新心。你有一种愿意过义的生活的渴望。

但因为是出于感恩，你不会看不起那些没有按“正确方式”生活的人，因为你知道自己是一个蒙恩得救的罪人。

另一方面，你也绝对知道：顺服上帝、讨他喜悦是至关重要的。

你不是道德主义者，你不是相对主义者，你是基督徒。

为什么？因为如果有一位神圣的审判者，你对自己还有什么盼望？

如果没有神圣的审判者，这世界又有什么盼望？

但在耶稣基督里——那位“被审判的审判者”——我们有盼望。

让我们祷告。

天父，我们感谢你向我们显明了我们道德确信的根基。但我们不只是需要一位“泛泛的上帝”。

我们需要一位在耶稣基督里来到地上、为我们死在十字架上的上帝。

因为你这样做了，我们就既不是相对主义者，也不是道德主义者。

我们可以与人谈论这些道德真理，因为我们知道他们心里也知道；但与此同时，这些真理不会压垮我们，我们也不惧怕它们。

因为在耶稣基督里，你承担了我们本该承担的咒诅，使你如今既能公义，又能称信的人为义；使我们能过一种既不道德主义、也不相对主义的生活——而是守律法、喜乐的生活。

父啊，这其中的智慧使我们不胜震撼；求你借着圣灵帮助我们把它应用在生命中。

我们奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。
