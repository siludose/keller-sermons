## English Transcript / 英文原文

Today, Tim Keller is looking at a passage from the opening chapter of the Gospel of John. John begins his account of Christ's birth, not the shepherds or angels, but with the mystery  of the word becoming flesh. God himself, entering the world as a person in Jesus Christ, join us as Tim Keller explores  the meaning of Jesus' birth. Tonight's scripture comes from the book of John, chapter 1, verses 1 through 11. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

He was with God in the beginning. Through Him, all things were made, without Him, nothing was made that has been made. When Him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind, the light shines in  the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through Him all might believe.

He himself was not the light. He came only as a witness to the light. The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world. And though the world was made through Him, the world did not recognize Him. He came to that which was His own, but His own did not receive Him.

This is the Word of the Lord. Well, we're going to be doing for the weeks of Advent, which are the four weeks going up to Christmas. It's taking a look at the first chapter of John. We've been in John chapter 13 to 17. We're looking at the first chapter, because John chapter 1 is about Jesus coming into the world.

It's basically John's way of talking about the meaning of Christmas. And even though there's many things that can be said about this very, very famous passage,  seven times the word light shows up here. So you see where I circled it? Can you see the only? Seven times the word light.

And though there will be other themes in here, I think we need to ask ourselves,  what is this telling us about light also? You all know that light in the darkness is really one of the ways that throughout history,  Christmas has been celebrated. It's one of the symbols as lighting candles and lights on trees and lights at night. What is that all about? Let's just take a look at how simply these first 11 verses of the gospel of John  tell us that we need light, human beings need a light, that there is a light,  and then how we can connect to it, how we can receive it.

We need light, there is a light, and how we can receive it. Now, first of all, the need for light, especially since verses 4 and 5,  in him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness is not overcome. Now, see here in verse 4, obviously there's light and there's lights, and here's lights, and you see the lights. But there is something that down in verse 9 is called the true light,  that everyone needs, and in verse 4 is the light of mankind, which means there's a kind of light that we all need.

But we're also told in these verses that our relationship with that true light is, how do you say it? It's very fraught, because obviously as we're going to get in a minute, down to verse 9 and 10,  it talks about when the true light came into the world, it was rejected. But here in verse 5, it says that in a sense the true light came into the dark world,  and it says, the darkness has not overcome it. Now, actually, if you've read this passage in more than one translation,  you know that the translators often come up with fairly different takes on how to translate that word. Sometimes it says the darkness has not comprehended it.

I think one of the older translations says, the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not. And sometimes the word here is overcome. Now, you say, well, that's pretty different. Well, yes and no. It's a single Greek word, but it's a word with, you might say, planned ambiguity in it.

It's really like our English word master. Now, think about what it means to master something. Sometimes to master something means to extinguish it, to fight with it and extinguish it. So, you master your fears, means you're trying to get rid of them. You master your fears, you're really trying to just, you know, you're trying to fight them, control them, and extinguish them.

But if you master a subject, you're not trying to just, you're trying to understand it. To say, I mastered that subject, I got it, understood it. So, which is it? Well, this word means both of those things,  and it's probably deliberately ambiguous, which means John is trying to say that there's a true light that human beings need. But we not only are hostile to it, but we're clueless about it.

We're not only hostile to it, we're clueless about it. And so, what it's actually saying is the world is a dark place, and we do not know how to enlighten ourselves. Now, let's go a little further with this idea of light. When the Bible talks about light and darkness, what is that symbolism? Well, it's really that hard, it's what it, you'd think it means.

First of all, to be dark sometimes means evil and suffering. Darkness means evil and suffering. We talk about the dark times in our lives, so we're in a dark place in our lives. And evil and suffering can have many, many, many forms. You know, when Jesus was born, if you go to the book of Matthew, it tells us that  Herod found out that there was someone born who was supposed to be the prophesied future king.

Herod decided to kill all the children in the village of Bethlehem to make sure there was no  future claimant to the throne. Mary and Joseph got away but had to go to Egypt. And so, you have refugees, and you've got violence, and you've got injustice,  and you've got war and grief, and sorrow, and broken families and bereavement,  and you know, just like now. The world's a dark place, the world continues to have all those things. So, when we talk about darkness, it can mean the world is filled with evil and suffering.

But darkness can also mean ignorance. You know, if I'm in a dark room, I don't know what's in the room, and I'm stumbling, and I'm falling,  because I'm in a dark, meaning to be in the dark can mean evil and suffering. The meaning of dark, I can't see reality. And again, what this means is to say the world is a dark place, is to say the world is filled with evil and suffering,  and we don't have the ability or the knowledge to know how to solve it. The world is filled with evil and suffering, and we do not have the ability or knowledge to know how to solve it.

Now, this is the very first, you might say, clue to what the Bible says, the meaning of Christmas,  the meaning of Jesus coming in the world is. And that is, this world is a dark place, and if there is going to be any light, it has to come from outside the human race. Matthew quotes Isaiah. It's a very famous passage. Isaiah chapter 9, partly because it got into Handel's Messiah, but Isaiah 9 says,  the people living in darkness have seen a great light.

On those living in the land of the shadow of death, a light has dawn. And that's Matthew's way of talking about, Jesus came into the world, means that we're in darkness,  and light has come in the world from outside the human race. Now, I want you to know what I'm about to tell you. I mean, pardon me, what I just told you, which is one of the messages of Christmas,  the world's a dark place, filled with evil and suffering. We do not have the ability or knowledge to know how to solve it ourselves.

If there is light or help, it's going to have to come from outside the human race. Everything in our culture is conditioning us to not believe that. Everything in our culture is against that. And this is a problem because Christmas is not going away. It is a commercial bananso.

They will never be able to get rid of Christmas, ever. And at least not in the foreseeable thousand years. And therefore, what are we going to do when the message of Christmas is a very opposite  of what the culture tells us? And the answer is, is the culture is going to constantly try to re-engineer Christmas? So a couple of years ago, I found this ad in the New York Times.

It was a Christmas ad. It was a commercial ad. Somebody was selling a product. It was a company. But this is what they said.

Quote, the meaning of Christmas is that love will triumph,  and that we will be able to put together a world of unity in peace. Okay, so this ad says, the meaning of Christmas is that if we all pull together,  we can do it. We can create a world of unity in peace, which is by the way,  the exact opposite of the message of Christmas. Because, see, the message of Christmas is not from them a light has come. It's upon them a light has dawn.

It comes from outside of us. We can't possibly generate that kind of light. We do not know how to solve our own problems or even stuff. We just can't. It's the opposite of the message.

And yet, pardon me, that's what the message of Christmas,  but the culture is going to be constantly trying to re-engineer it, but it won't work. Valkov Hava, who was the first president of Czech Republic,  he had been both, he lived under socialism, and he lived under free market capitalism. And you know what he said? Neither of these things are going to solve the greatest human problems. In fact, he said, technology and science, they can tell you what you can do,  and they can tell you how to do it efficiently, but they can never tell you whether you should do it or not.

And therefore, he said that neither the technology nor the state government nor the market  will ever be able to save us from nuclear conflict or environmental degradation or ethnic violence. And he says, quote, pursuit of the good life will not help humanity save itself,  nor is democracy alone enough. Atturning to and seeking of God is needed. The human race constantly forgets that he is not God, and that's the message of Christmas. So this world is a dark place, that's 0.1, but 0.2, the other thing we're told here,  is that there is a light.

Yes, it's outside the human race, but there is a light. The light we need is exists. Well, where is it? Well, now let's look at verses 1, 2, and 3. And by the way, in verse 14, which we didn't read,  we're going to get there in the coming weeks,  it says that the word of God is Jesus.

Now I'll get back to this term word later, but right now you can just put the word Jesus in there,  because later on in the very chapter it tells us the word of God is another name for Jesus. So let's read this, and here's what verse 1 says. In the beginning was Jesus, and Jesus was with God, and Jesus was God. All right, let's stop right there. That might be familiar to you, you've heard it before, but let me show you how aptly startling it is,  when the two truths that are being given to you in this sense are put next to each other.

First of all, it tells us, Jesus is God. It doesn't say Jesus is a God. There's no article. In the Greek, the original Greek, there's no article. It doesn't say Jesus Christ was a God.

It says Jesus Christ was God. If it said Jesus was a God, then there'd be more than one God, right? The Bible's not saying that. It's saying that, you know God, the one God, Jesus is that one God. But then, right next to it, it says Jesus was God, Jesus is God,  and Jesus is with God.

Now the word with means to have a relationship. You go to the bottom of, well, actually, you go later on in the Gospels, I guess it's in Mark,  where it says that when Jesus chose 12 disciples, it says He chose them to be with Him,  and to be with means to live with Him, to be His intimates, to be in a love relationship with Him,  to be in a relationship of the closest communication and love,  so to be with someone, that's a term that in the Bible means to be in a relationship with Him. So here's what it's saying. There's only one God, and Jesus is God, and yet Jesus is in a love relationship with God,  and Jesus is God, and Jesus is in a love relationship with God. And even though the Holy Spirit's not mentioned here, even though the Holy Spirit is mentioned elsewhere in the Bible,  here's what we got.

There's only one God, not three God, there's only one God. But within that one God, the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit, no one love each other. There's one God, but inside that one God there's three persons who, from all eternity,  notice what it says, it says, through Him all things were made,  without Him nothing was made that has been made. Which means the Son, Jesus Christ was not created, everything that ever made through Him,  which means that the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit, have all from the beginning endlessly known in love each other. Only Christianity then says that at the very heart of God, only Christianity says this.

The very heart of God is a dynamical of relationship. From all eternity in the very being of God, there have been three persons who know each other  and love each other and glorify each other and adore each other,  and they have been loving and communicating with each other from all eternity. Inside God there is an exploding, dynamic, infinitely powerful set of relationships. And therefore, the meaning of life is relationship in love. See, if there was one God who only had one personality, one person,  and then that person that God created other beings, then love comes in later, right?

There's power and then there's love, isn't that right? If there was one God who only had one person, he was only one personality, one guy with one person,  and that person created other beings, then you can't have love until you have other beings, right? Other persons. So first God is powerful, and then later on comes in love. But if you have a triune God, if you have a God who is the Father, Son, Holy Spirit, from all eternity, then love is first.

Love is the most important thing, and relationships are the most important thing, and communication is the most important thing. But let me go a little further here. I think that this part of the Bible is actually trying to get you,  it's really trying to just astonish us with the fact that when the Bible says God is love,  you and I probably tend to think, okay, that means God is somehow loving. No, no, no. God is much more literally that.

God from all eternity, before He created the world, before He did anything else, was already love, and dynamic love, interpersonal love, friendship,  and in verse 18, we didn't get to that either, but in verse 18, some of you know, because it's such a, you've heard it before,  it's so famous, this passage, it says this, from all eternity, the Son was in the bosom of the Father, in the bosom of the Father. I think that that's John's, by using that language, I think John is deliberately trying to get you to use your imagination for a minute. So will you come with me? As 2025 comes to a close, it should come as no surprise that we have great hope for the year ahead.

Thank you for partnering with us to share the love of Christ with a world that needs Him because the Gospel truly changes everything. Now, here's Dr. Keller with the remainder of today's message. How many people are there in the world right now that if you were laying on a sofa, you know, without even asking permission, could walk right over to you and lay down right alongside of you and lay right up against you, and that would be fine.

How many people are there like that? Not many, right? And the ones that can do that are in the most intimate relationship possible, right? So I think this is what we're being asked. If you want to understand who God is and what God is like, then you have to start to imagine the time in your life when you felt the most loved.

Now multiply that by a trillion, trillion, trillion. Imagine the time in your life when you felt the most understood, the most appreciated, the most adored, the most secure, the most significant. And you remember the joy of that, okay? And it's impossible almost to hold on to that because we're selfish beings. And so even if you're in a good marriage, those kinds of times come and go.

Even if you're in one of the best marriages, those times only come and go because we tend to be selfish and we tend to want to not give to each other, but we want to receive, you know, and we fight. And therefore those times in which we have been the most blissful, the most loved, the most joyful, the most adored, those times they're fleeting, right? And they're partial, right? Now imagine three persons who are perfect persons who always love and glorify the people they love. Who never are saying you've got to serve me, but they're always serving each other.

And that they're giving themselves to each other exhaustively and completely from all eternity. So you have to take the few moments in your life that you've experienced some of that. Multiply by a trillion, trillion, trillion, and that is the, and that is God. God is infinitely happy. God is infinitely loving.

God is experiencing love and joy. The fathers and the Holy Spirit are just pouring joy and love and glory into each other's souls endlessly. They're bathed in the joy of each other. They're bathed in the love of each other. They are therefore infinitely happy, infinitely joyful, infinitely loving.

And you know why would God have created other beings to share in it? Why would God create beings that are in God's image? So that we can do it with each other and with God to share in all that. Now you say, what does all that got to do with the theme? Everything.

Because, here's what I'm trying to show you. First John 1.5, as John wrote three letters, as well as the book of John. First John 1.5 says, this is the message we heard from Jesus and now declare to you,  God is light, and in him there is no darkness at all. Well, what is the light? That's kind of abstract.

What is the light? This is the light. You know why this is the light? This infinite love, this pulsating love. This isn't just kind of a general sentiment.

We're talking about real live interaction, communication. This is the light. When he says, God is light, that's kind of an abstraction. What is the light we need? This is what we need.

Why? Let's look at our darkness. Every single bit of evil and suffering in this world, the darkness of this world. What is it at bottom? It's always a lack of love.

It's a loss of love. What is war? What is racism? What is injustice? What is crime?

What is violence? What is divorce? What is a broken family? What is bereavement? What is grief?

What is sorrow? What is it? It's always the loss of love. It's always the lack of love, always. That's our darkness.

And why do we have problem? Why can't we generate our own light? Because we're selfish. Because there's something about our heart that says, me first. You know, here's the great irony about the human nature.

We want love. We want love more than anything else. That's what makes our life meaningful. We know that. You know, nobody, you know, I'd like to, this is true.

I'd like to say it. You know, I've watched people die. I've seen people at the end. None of them ever say I wish I'd spent more time at the office. None of them say I wish I'd made more money.

They all said I wish I'd spent more time with the people I love. I wish I'd worked on relationships. That's the meaning of life. And yet, at the same time, we've got something in us that says, me first. You serve me.

That's the end of love. Love is you first. I will serve you. And God's got that. God's got that infinitely.

And because God is therefore infinitely unselfish and loving, he's infinitely happy. And we don't have that. And so, we're in darkness and we need that light. And by the way, before going on to say, well, how do we get it? Let's keep in mind how different the Christian view of the world is.

The Christian view of the universe is because we believe that in the beginning  was an interpersonal God who, the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit,  loving each other from all eternity. You know how different that is? From ancient paganism and modern secularism. Ancient paganism says, here's how the world came about. There were these multiple power centers called gods.

There was all these different gods and they fought with each other. And that's how the earth got created. And that's how this and that happened. So, in other words, ancient paganism believed the world at its heart  was multiple power centers struggling against each other, power struggle. Modern secularism doesn't believe in gods.

No, but it believes in an impersonal universe, impersonal. And it believes that the world got here through violent forces  and that human beings evolved through survival of the fittest,  nature red and tooth and crock claw, the strong eating the weak. So ancient paganism and modern secularism say the essence of the world is power  and struggle. And Christianity says in the beginning there was withness. In the beginning there was withness.

In the beginning there was love. Infinite love, endless love, powerful love. And that love is the light we need. Okay, thirdly, then, how do we get it? How does it happen?

Now, obviously, as the beginning of the book of John,  the rest of the book of John is all about that. And so, we have to kind of look ahead, but there's a hint even in here. And it's down here at the end. The true light, this is verse 9, 10, 11. The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world.

He was in the world, and though the world was made through him,  the world did not recognize him. He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. Now, what this is saying is pretty simple. And that is that Jesus Christ came into the world to be rejected. He knew he would be rejected.

But the ultimate rejection was, they didn't, it says his own did not receive him more than that,  his own killed him. He came to us. We are his own. He created us, verse 1 and 2. He created us.

If you make something, if you make something, it's yours. He made us. Not only are we his own, but of course, he's our true light. We need him, but he was rejected. And he was put to death.

Why? Well, because this is the darkness in our hearts. We want love, and yet at the same time we're afraid of anybody coming in and saying,  you have to serve me. No, no, I don't want to serve anybody. My heart says I want to be in charge.

And so what Jesus Christ had to do was he had to overcome the barrier between ourselves and God. The Bible says there's a barrier between us and God. And what did he do? He went to the cross and on the cross, two things happened. Darkness came down.

It was the middle of the day. It was the middle of the day. But Matthew 27.45 says that in the middle of the day, it became completely dark. Darkness came down. Why?

The light of the world descended into darkness. But that was only symbolic. At the same time, he cried out, one verse later, it says, darkness came down. Verse 45, Matthew 27.45. And Matthew 27.46 says,  And he cried out, my God, my God, why has thou forsaken me?

You see, we've been making a connection here between light and love. Darkness and selfishness. And so let's just make the connection here. What was happening to Jesus on the cross? Hourly, darkness came down.

Inwardly, darkness was coming down. What was it? It was the loss of love. Jesus Christ went to the cross to take the penalty, our sins deserve. What is the penalty for selfishness?

See, selfishness is His own punishment. Selfishness is the loss of love. If you're in a marriage and both of you are being selfish,  nobody has to come along and find you. Stop being selfish. It's a thousand dollars a day.

No, you're losing love. You're pulling away from each other. It's awful. And it's true in friendships. It's true in families.

It's true everywhere. So what is the punishment that selfishness deserves? It's the punishment that selfishness always gets. The loss of love. Oh my goodness, but what Jesus was experiencing.

See, the reason why Jesus agony atone for the sins of the whole world. Why he took the punishment for everybody was this. Counselors will tell you and psychologists will tell you  but you don't need them to tell you because you know this intuitively anyway. Is that there is no greater pain  and there's no greater psychological pain in trauma than the loss of a spouse  through death or divorce. The loss of love.

Why? Because it's a very, very deep kind of love. It's the most intimate kind of relationship  and to lose it one way or the other is awful. Oh my goodness, but don't forget,  even if you've been married for 60 years,  even if you had a great marriage,  two human beings can only love each other so much,  but the father and the son have loved each other from all eternity  and perfectly and can you imagine? If you're not agonizing just to lose love right now  and you're infinite in our infinite kind of limited way,  what must it have been like?

Think of the agony. Think of the hell that Jesus experienced on the cross. The agony and pain he experienced on the cross,  that loss of love was greater than was so much as greater than anything  you and I have ever experienced as a nuclear warhead is  greater than the pop of a rubber band. And he died for our sins. And the reason why that is the key to connecting to the light is this.

Number one, objectively, our sins are forgiven. So when I say father forgive me because of what Jesus did,  God can forgive my sins and now come into my life  and begin to start to fill me with His love. So that I begin to be somebody who actually can start to love other people  and you can become someone who can love other people. It's a matter of money. Listen, it's very, very, very hard to be really generous to people  when you can't pay your own light bill.

But if you have a lot of money, then it's easier to be generous. A lot of people aren't generous with it, but it's at least possible. And the same thing with love, it's very hard to love other people  and not be selfish when your own insights are so needy. When you don't feel very lovable yourself,  but when God's love starts to pour in through the cross,  when you see that Jesus Christ lost infinite love out of love for you,  that begins to melt your heart, and that begins to fill you up. And you become rich in love so you start to be able to give other people love  without always doing it in a kind of selfish way or a manipulative way.

But so that's what Jesus has to do, but here's what you have to do. Here's what you have to do. You have to make him your reason for life. Now, what do I mean by that? What I'm about to tell you in the next two minutes could have been the whole sermon.

But I like to go back to the very beginning where it says,  in the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God. Why is Jesus Christ called the word? It's the Greek word logos,  from which we get our word logic, and also reason, right, logic or reason. And actually, when John says, Jesus Christ was the logos,  he is deliberately connecting to a major cultural debate that was going on at that time. Because the Greek philosophers believe that there was a logos behind the universe.

There was a reason behind the universe to understand what they meant. Think of this. You do not know how to use, let's just say, an appliance,  unless you know the reason it was made. For example, if I take my watch and I try to hammer a nail with it,  I'm going to ruin the watch, you know why? Because I'm not aligning with the reason the logos of the watch.

The logos of the watches, the reason it was made. What was it made for? It was made to tell time not to hammer nails. And therefore, unless I align myself with the logos of the watch,  the watch will not work. If you take a space heater and you try to cook on it,  you might burn down your apartment.

You know why? Because the logo of the space heater is not to be cooked upon. It's to heat your space. And if you're not aligning yourself with the logos of the space heater,  you're in danger. Well, the Greek philosopher said, well, what if there's a logos to human life?

What if there's a logos to the world? What if there's a logos behind the universe? And if we align with that, in other words,  what if there was a purpose for human life? And if we aligned with that, that our lives would go well. So they argued about it.

And they thought the logos was a proposition, a way of living. And this person said, well, the logo, there were various schools of thought. And some philosopher says, well, I think it's this. This is the logos. And other philosophers thought this is the logos.

And some philosophers thought there is no logos. But they all said that you get to it through philosophical contemplation,  through philosophical reasoning and thinking you can discern the reason  that human beings were supposed to live. And then you align yourself with it, and along comes John. And he blows it all up, the gospel of John. And he brought an idea in that was revolutionary in the history of human thought.

And he says, yes, there is a logos. Yes, the universe does have meaning. Yes, there actually is a reason for life. There is something you were created for. But that logos, that reason, is not an abstract proposition.

It's a person that you know and love. It's Jesus Christ, and he's come into this world and you can know and love him. You know how revolutionary that was? If Jesus is the reason for life, that's what it means when it says,  in the beginning, was the logos. If Jesus is the reason for life, then I don't have to be a philosopher.

It's a certain that anybody can have a relationship with him. And it means that the meaning of life is not so much knowledge  and contemplation and philosophical knowledge. It's love. And therefore, let me ask you a question. Is Jesus the reason for your life?

Is Jesus the reason you get up in the morning? Is the reason you get out of bed? I'm not asking you to believe in Jesus. Do you pray to Jesus? Do you hope that Jesus will help you?

I mean, is he your very reason for life? Is he the whole reason you're living? He was yours. What do you think about that? Jesus was perfectly happy in heaven.

That was the point two here of the sermon. He was doing fine. He didn't need the trip. He was just fine. Why did he come?

Why did he go through all that? What was the very reason for his human life? It was you and me. His very reason for life was you and me. Now you go make him your reason for life.

It's only fair. And when you make him your reason for life,  the very reason that you live your life day to day. He'll fill you with love  and you'll become part of the solution  that this dark world needs instead of part of the problem. Let us pray. Our Father, we thank You that there is a light.

That light is the dynamic love and joy that You are capable of. And You make us capable of. We thank You that Your Son was willing to lose all that,  to lose all that joy, to lose all that love in order to bring us into it. And therefore, oh, we need light, but there is a light. And we pray that You would fill us with Your light and Your love.

And make us Your like Your Son. It's in His name that we pray. Amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

Today, Tim Keller is looking at a passage from the opening chapter of the Gospel of John. John begins his account of Christ's birth, not the shepherds or angels, but with the mystery  of the word becoming flesh. God himself, entering the world as a person in Jesus Christ, join us as Tim Keller explores  the meaning of Jesus' birth. Tonight's scripture comes from the book of John, chapter 1, verses 1 through 11. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

He was with God in the beginning. Through Him, all things were made, without Him, nothing was made that has been made. When Him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind, the light shines in  the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through Him all might believe.

He himself was not the light. He came only as a witness to the light. The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world. And though the world was made through Him, the world did not recognize Him. He came to that which was His own, but His own did not receive Him.

This is the Word of the Lord. Well, we're going to be doing for the weeks of Advent, which are the four weeks going up to Christmas. It's taking a look at the first chapter of John. We've been in John chapter 13 to 17. We're looking at the first chapter, because John chapter 1 is about Jesus coming into the world.

It's basically John's way of talking about the meaning of Christmas. And even though there's many things that can be said about this very, very famous passage,  seven times the word light shows up here. So you see where I circled it? Can you see the only? Seven times the word light.

And though there will be other themes in here, I think we need to ask ourselves,  what is this telling us about light also? You all know that light in the darkness is really one of the ways that throughout history,  Christmas has been celebrated. It's one of the symbols as lighting candles and lights on trees and lights at night. What is that all about? Let's just take a look at how simply these first 11 verses of the gospel of John  tell us that we need light, human beings need a light, that there is a light,  and then how we can connect to it, how we can receive it.

We need light, there is a light, and how we can receive it. Now, first of all, the need for light, especially since verses 4 and 5,  in him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness is not overcome. Now, see here in verse 4, obviously there's light and there's lights, and here's lights, and you see the lights. But there is something that down in verse 9 is called the true light,  that everyone needs, and in verse 4 is the light of mankind, which means there's a kind of light that we all need.

But we're also told in these verses that our relationship with that true light is, how do you say it? It's very fraught, because obviously as we're going to get in a minute, down to verse 9 and 10,  it talks about when the true light came into the world, it was rejected. But here in verse 5, it says that in a sense the true light came into the dark world,  and it says, the darkness has not overcome it. Now, actually, if you've read this passage in more than one translation,  you know that the translators often come up with fairly different takes on how to translate that word. Sometimes it says the darkness has not comprehended it.

I think one of the older translations says, the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not. And sometimes the word here is overcome. Now, you say, well, that's pretty different. Well, yes and no. It's a single Greek word, but it's a word with, you might say, planned ambiguity in it.

It's really like our English word master. Now, think about what it means to master something. Sometimes to master something means to extinguish it, to fight with it and extinguish it. So, you master your fears, means you're trying to get rid of them. You master your fears, you're really trying to just, you know, you're trying to fight them, control them, and extinguish them.

But if you master a subject, you're not trying to just, you're trying to understand it. To say, I mastered that subject, I got it, understood it. So, which is it? Well, this word means both of those things,  and it's probably deliberately ambiguous, which means John is trying to say that there's a true light that human beings need. But we not only are hostile to it, but we're clueless about it.

We're not only hostile to it, we're clueless about it. And so, what it's actually saying is the world is a dark place, and we do not know how to enlighten ourselves. Now, let's go a little further with this idea of light. When the Bible talks about light and darkness, what is that symbolism? Well, it's really that hard, it's what it, you'd think it means.

First of all, to be dark sometimes means evil and suffering. Darkness means evil and suffering. We talk about the dark times in our lives, so we're in a dark place in our lives. And evil and suffering can have many, many, many forms. You know, when Jesus was born, if you go to the book of Matthew, it tells us that  Herod found out that there was someone born who was supposed to be the prophesied future king.

Herod decided to kill all the children in the village of Bethlehem to make sure there was no  future claimant to the throne. Mary and Joseph got away but had to go to Egypt. And so, you have refugees, and you've got violence, and you've got injustice,  and you've got war and grief, and sorrow, and broken families and bereavement,  and you know, just like now. The world's a dark place, the world continues to have all those things. So, when we talk about darkness, it can mean the world is filled with evil and suffering.

But darkness can also mean ignorance. You know, if I'm in a dark room, I don't know what's in the room, and I'm stumbling, and I'm falling,  because I'm in a dark, meaning to be in the dark can mean evil and suffering. The meaning of dark, I can't see reality. And again, what this means is to say the world is a dark place, is to say the world is filled with evil and suffering,  and we don't have the ability or the knowledge to know how to solve it. The world is filled with evil and suffering, and we do not have the ability or knowledge to know how to solve it.

Now, this is the very first, you might say, clue to what the Bible says, the meaning of Christmas,  the meaning of Jesus coming in the world is. And that is, this world is a dark place, and if there is going to be any light, it has to come from outside the human race. Matthew quotes Isaiah. It's a very famous passage. Isaiah chapter 9, partly because it got into Handel's Messiah, but Isaiah 9 says,  the people living in darkness have seen a great light.

On those living in the land of the shadow of death, a light has dawn. And that's Matthew's way of talking about, Jesus came into the world, means that we're in darkness,  and light has come in the world from outside the human race. Now, I want you to know what I'm about to tell you. I mean, pardon me, what I just told you, which is one of the messages of Christmas,  the world's a dark place, filled with evil and suffering. We do not have the ability or knowledge to know how to solve it ourselves.

If there is light or help, it's going to have to come from outside the human race. Everything in our culture is conditioning us to not believe that. Everything in our culture is against that. And this is a problem because Christmas is not going away. It is a commercial bananso.

They will never be able to get rid of Christmas, ever. And at least not in the foreseeable thousand years. And therefore, what are we going to do when the message of Christmas is a very opposite  of what the culture tells us? And the answer is, is the culture is going to constantly try to re-engineer Christmas? So a couple of years ago, I found this ad in the New York Times.

It was a Christmas ad. It was a commercial ad. Somebody was selling a product. It was a company. But this is what they said.

Quote, the meaning of Christmas is that love will triumph,  and that we will be able to put together a world of unity in peace. Okay, so this ad says, the meaning of Christmas is that if we all pull together,  we can do it. We can create a world of unity in peace, which is by the way,  the exact opposite of the message of Christmas. Because, see, the message of Christmas is not from them a light has come. It's upon them a light has dawn.

It comes from outside of us. We can't possibly generate that kind of light. We do not know how to solve our own problems or even stuff. We just can't. It's the opposite of the message.

And yet, pardon me, that's what the message of Christmas,  but the culture is going to be constantly trying to re-engineer it, but it won't work. Valkov Hava, who was the first president of Czech Republic,  he had been both, he lived under socialism, and he lived under free market capitalism. And you know what he said? Neither of these things are going to solve the greatest human problems. In fact, he said, technology and science, they can tell you what you can do,  and they can tell you how to do it efficiently, but they can never tell you whether you should do it or not.

And therefore, he said that neither the technology nor the state government nor the market  will ever be able to save us from nuclear conflict or environmental degradation or ethnic violence. And he says, quote, pursuit of the good life will not help humanity save itself,  nor is democracy alone enough. Atturning to and seeking of God is needed. The human race constantly forgets that he is not God, and that's the message of Christmas. So this world is a dark place, that's 0.1, but 0.2, the other thing we're told here,  is that there is a light.

Yes, it's outside the human race, but there is a light. The light we need is exists. Well, where is it? Well, now let's look at verses 1, 2, and 3. And by the way, in verse 14, which we didn't read,  we're going to get there in the coming weeks,  it says that the word of God is Jesus.

Now I'll get back to this term word later, but right now you can just put the word Jesus in there,  because later on in the very chapter it tells us the word of God is another name for Jesus. So let's read this, and here's what verse 1 says. In the beginning was Jesus, and Jesus was with God, and Jesus was God. All right, let's stop right there. That might be familiar to you, you've heard it before, but let me show you how aptly startling it is,  when the two truths that are being given to you in this sense are put next to each other.

First of all, it tells us, Jesus is God. It doesn't say Jesus is a God. There's no article. In the Greek, the original Greek, there's no article. It doesn't say Jesus Christ was a God.

It says Jesus Christ was God. If it said Jesus was a God, then there'd be more than one God, right? The Bible's not saying that. It's saying that, you know God, the one God, Jesus is that one God. But then, right next to it, it says Jesus was God, Jesus is God,  and Jesus is with God.

Now the word with means to have a relationship. You go to the bottom of, well, actually, you go later on in the Gospels, I guess it's in Mark,  where it says that when Jesus chose 12 disciples, it says He chose them to be with Him,  and to be with means to live with Him, to be His intimates, to be in a love relationship with Him,  to be in a relationship of the closest communication and love,  so to be with someone, that's a term that in the Bible means to be in a relationship with Him. So here's what it's saying. There's only one God, and Jesus is God, and yet Jesus is in a love relationship with God,  and Jesus is God, and Jesus is in a love relationship with God. And even though the Holy Spirit's not mentioned here, even though the Holy Spirit is mentioned elsewhere in the Bible,  here's what we got.

There's only one God, not three God, there's only one God. But within that one God, the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit, no one love each other. There's one God, but inside that one God there's three persons who, from all eternity,  notice what it says, it says, through Him all things were made,  without Him nothing was made that has been made. Which means the Son, Jesus Christ was not created, everything that ever made through Him,  which means that the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit, have all from the beginning endlessly known in love each other. Only Christianity then says that at the very heart of God, only Christianity says this.

The very heart of God is a dynamical of relationship. From all eternity in the very being of God, there have been three persons who know each other  and love each other and glorify each other and adore each other,  and they have been loving and communicating with each other from all eternity. Inside God there is an exploding, dynamic, infinitely powerful set of relationships. And therefore, the meaning of life is relationship in love. See, if there was one God who only had one personality, one person,  and then that person that God created other beings, then love comes in later, right?

There's power and then there's love, isn't that right? If there was one God who only had one person, he was only one personality, one guy with one person,  and that person created other beings, then you can't have love until you have other beings, right? Other persons. So first God is powerful, and then later on comes in love. But if you have a triune God, if you have a God who is the Father, Son, Holy Spirit, from all eternity, then love is first.

Love is the most important thing, and relationships are the most important thing, and communication is the most important thing. But let me go a little further here. I think that this part of the Bible is actually trying to get you,  it's really trying to just astonish us with the fact that when the Bible says God is love,  you and I probably tend to think, okay, that means God is somehow loving. No, no, no. God is much more literally that.

God from all eternity, before He created the world, before He did anything else, was already love, and dynamic love, interpersonal love, friendship,  and in verse 18, we didn't get to that either, but in verse 18, some of you know, because it's such a, you've heard it before,  it's so famous, this passage, it says this, from all eternity, the Son was in the bosom of the Father, in the bosom of the Father. I think that that's John's, by using that language, I think John is deliberately trying to get you to use your imagination for a minute. So will you come with me? As 2025 comes to a close, it should come as no surprise that we have great hope for the year ahead.

Thank you for partnering with us to share the love of Christ with a world that needs Him because the Gospel truly changes everything. Now, here's Dr. Keller with the remainder of today's message. How many people are there in the world right now that if you were laying on a sofa, you know, without even asking permission, could walk right over to you and lay down right alongside of you and lay right up against you, and that would be fine.

How many people are there like that? Not many, right? And the ones that can do that are in the most intimate relationship possible, right? So I think this is what we're being asked. If you want to understand who God is and what God is like, then you have to start to imagine the time in your life when you felt the most loved.

Now multiply that by a trillion, trillion, trillion. Imagine the time in your life when you felt the most understood, the most appreciated, the most adored, the most secure, the most significant. And you remember the joy of that, okay? And it's impossible almost to hold on to that because we're selfish beings. And so even if you're in a good marriage, those kinds of times come and go.

Even if you're in one of the best marriages, those times only come and go because we tend to be selfish and we tend to want to not give to each other, but we want to receive, you know, and we fight. And therefore those times in which we have been the most blissful, the most loved, the most joyful, the most adored, those times they're fleeting, right? And they're partial, right? Now imagine three persons who are perfect persons who always love and glorify the people they love. Who never are saying you've got to serve me, but they're always serving each other.

And that they're giving themselves to each other exhaustively and completely from all eternity. So you have to take the few moments in your life that you've experienced some of that. Multiply by a trillion, trillion, trillion, and that is the, and that is God. God is infinitely happy. God is infinitely loving.

God is experiencing love and joy. The fathers and the Holy Spirit are just pouring joy and love and glory into each other's souls endlessly. They're bathed in the joy of each other. They're bathed in the love of each other. They are therefore infinitely happy, infinitely joyful, infinitely loving.

And you know why would God have created other beings to share in it? Why would God create beings that are in God's image? So that we can do it with each other and with God to share in all that. Now you say, what does all that got to do with the theme? Everything.

Because, here's what I'm trying to show you. First John 1.5, as John wrote three letters, as well as the book of John. First John 1.5 says, this is the message we heard from Jesus and now declare to you,  God is light, and in him there is no darkness at all. Well, what is the light? That's kind of abstract.

What is the light? This is the light. You know why this is the light? This infinite love, this pulsating love. This isn't just kind of a general sentiment.

We're talking about real live interaction, communication. This is the light. When he says, God is light, that's kind of an abstraction. What is the light we need? This is what we need.

Why? Let's look at our darkness. Every single bit of evil and suffering in this world, the darkness of this world. What is it at bottom? It's always a lack of love.

It's a loss of love. What is war? What is racism? What is injustice? What is crime?

What is violence? What is divorce? What is a broken family? What is bereavement? What is grief?

What is sorrow? What is it? It's always the loss of love. It's always the lack of love, always. That's our darkness.

And why do we have problem? Why can't we generate our own light? Because we're selfish. Because there's something about our heart that says, me first. You know, here's the great irony about the human nature.

We want love. We want love more than anything else. That's what makes our life meaningful. We know that. You know, nobody, you know, I'd like to, this is true.

I'd like to say it. You know, I've watched people die. I've seen people at the end. None of them ever say I wish I'd spent more time at the office. None of them say I wish I'd made more money.

They all said I wish I'd spent more time with the people I love. I wish I'd worked on relationships. That's the meaning of life. And yet, at the same time, we've got something in us that says, me first. You serve me.

That's the end of love. Love is you first. I will serve you. And God's got that. God's got that infinitely.

And because God is therefore infinitely unselfish and loving, he's infinitely happy. And we don't have that. And so, we're in darkness and we need that light. And by the way, before going on to say, well, how do we get it? Let's keep in mind how different the Christian view of the world is.

The Christian view of the universe is because we believe that in the beginning  was an interpersonal God who, the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit,  loving each other from all eternity. You know how different that is? From ancient paganism and modern secularism. Ancient paganism says, here's how the world came about. There were these multiple power centers called gods.

There was all these different gods and they fought with each other. And that's how the earth got created. And that's how this and that happened. So, in other words, ancient paganism believed the world at its heart  was multiple power centers struggling against each other, power struggle. Modern secularism doesn't believe in gods.

No, but it believes in an impersonal universe, impersonal. And it believes that the world got here through violent forces  and that human beings evolved through survival of the fittest,  nature red and tooth and crock claw, the strong eating the weak. So ancient paganism and modern secularism say the essence of the world is power  and struggle. And Christianity says in the beginning there was withness. In the beginning there was withness.

In the beginning there was love. Infinite love, endless love, powerful love. And that love is the light we need. Okay, thirdly, then, how do we get it? How does it happen?

Now, obviously, as the beginning of the book of John,  the rest of the book of John is all about that. And so, we have to kind of look ahead, but there's a hint even in here. And it's down here at the end. The true light, this is verse 9, 10, 11. The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world.

He was in the world, and though the world was made through him,  the world did not recognize him. He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. Now, what this is saying is pretty simple. And that is that Jesus Christ came into the world to be rejected. He knew he would be rejected.

But the ultimate rejection was, they didn't, it says his own did not receive him more than that,  his own killed him. He came to us. We are his own. He created us, verse 1 and 2. He created us.

If you make something, if you make something, it's yours. He made us. Not only are we his own, but of course, he's our true light. We need him, but he was rejected. And he was put to death.

Why? Well, because this is the darkness in our hearts. We want love, and yet at the same time we're afraid of anybody coming in and saying,  you have to serve me. No, no, I don't want to serve anybody. My heart says I want to be in charge.

And so what Jesus Christ had to do was he had to overcome the barrier between ourselves and God. The Bible says there's a barrier between us and God. And what did he do? He went to the cross and on the cross, two things happened. Darkness came down.

It was the middle of the day. It was the middle of the day. But Matthew 27.45 says that in the middle of the day, it became completely dark. Darkness came down. Why?

The light of the world descended into darkness. But that was only symbolic. At the same time, he cried out, one verse later, it says, darkness came down. Verse 45, Matthew 27.45. And Matthew 27.46 says,  And he cried out, my God, my God, why has thou forsaken me?

You see, we've been making a connection here between light and love. Darkness and selfishness. And so let's just make the connection here. What was happening to Jesus on the cross? Hourly, darkness came down.

Inwardly, darkness was coming down. What was it? It was the loss of love. Jesus Christ went to the cross to take the penalty, our sins deserve. What is the penalty for selfishness?

See, selfishness is His own punishment. Selfishness is the loss of love. If you're in a marriage and both of you are being selfish,  nobody has to come along and find you. Stop being selfish. It's a thousand dollars a day.

No, you're losing love. You're pulling away from each other. It's awful. And it's true in friendships. It's true in families.

It's true everywhere. So what is the punishment that selfishness deserves? It's the punishment that selfishness always gets. The loss of love. Oh my goodness, but what Jesus was experiencing.

See, the reason why Jesus agony atone for the sins of the whole world. Why he took the punishment for everybody was this. Counselors will tell you and psychologists will tell you  but you don't need them to tell you because you know this intuitively anyway. Is that there is no greater pain  and there's no greater psychological pain in trauma than the loss of a spouse  through death or divorce. The loss of love.

Why? Because it's a very, very deep kind of love. It's the most intimate kind of relationship  and to lose it one way or the other is awful. Oh my goodness, but don't forget,  even if you've been married for 60 years,  even if you had a great marriage,  two human beings can only love each other so much,  but the father and the son have loved each other from all eternity  and perfectly and can you imagine? If you're not agonizing just to lose love right now  and you're infinite in our infinite kind of limited way,  what must it have been like?

Think of the agony. Think of the hell that Jesus experienced on the cross. The agony and pain he experienced on the cross,  that loss of love was greater than was so much as greater than anything  you and I have ever experienced as a nuclear warhead is  greater than the pop of a rubber band. And he died for our sins. And the reason why that is the key to connecting to the light is this.

Number one, objectively, our sins are forgiven. So when I say father forgive me because of what Jesus did,  God can forgive my sins and now come into my life  and begin to start to fill me with His love. So that I begin to be somebody who actually can start to love other people  and you can become someone who can love other people. It's a matter of money. Listen, it's very, very, very hard to be really generous to people  when you can't pay your own light bill.

But if you have a lot of money, then it's easier to be generous. A lot of people aren't generous with it, but it's at least possible. And the same thing with love, it's very hard to love other people  and not be selfish when your own insights are so needy. When you don't feel very lovable yourself,  but when God's love starts to pour in through the cross,  when you see that Jesus Christ lost infinite love out of love for you,  that begins to melt your heart, and that begins to fill you up. And you become rich in love so you start to be able to give other people love  without always doing it in a kind of selfish way or a manipulative way.

But so that's what Jesus has to do, but here's what you have to do. Here's what you have to do. You have to make him your reason for life. Now, what do I mean by that? What I'm about to tell you in the next two minutes could have been the whole sermon.

But I like to go back to the very beginning where it says,  in the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God. Why is Jesus Christ called the word? It's the Greek word logos,  from which we get our word logic, and also reason, right, logic or reason. And actually, when John says, Jesus Christ was the logos,  he is deliberately connecting to a major cultural debate that was going on at that time. Because the Greek philosophers believe that there was a logos behind the universe.

There was a reason behind the universe to understand what they meant. Think of this. You do not know how to use, let's just say, an appliance,  unless you know the reason it was made. For example, if I take my watch and I try to hammer a nail with it,  I'm going to ruin the watch, you know why? Because I'm not aligning with the reason the logos of the watch.

The logos of the watches, the reason it was made. What was it made for? It was made to tell time not to hammer nails. And therefore, unless I align myself with the logos of the watch,  the watch will not work. If you take a space heater and you try to cook on it,  you might burn down your apartment.

You know why? Because the logo of the space heater is not to be cooked upon. It's to heat your space. And if you're not aligning yourself with the logos of the space heater,  you're in danger. Well, the Greek philosopher said, well, what if there's a logos to human life?

What if there's a logos to the world? What if there's a logos behind the universe? And if we align with that, in other words,  what if there was a purpose for human life? And if we aligned with that, that our lives would go well. So they argued about it.

And they thought the logos was a proposition, a way of living. And this person said, well, the logo, there were various schools of thought. And some philosopher says, well, I think it's this. This is the logos. And other philosophers thought this is the logos.

And some philosophers thought there is no logos. But they all said that you get to it through philosophical contemplation,  through philosophical reasoning and thinking you can discern the reason  that human beings were supposed to live. And then you align yourself with it, and along comes John. And he blows it all up, the gospel of John. And he brought an idea in that was revolutionary in the history of human thought.

And he says, yes, there is a logos. Yes, the universe does have meaning. Yes, there actually is a reason for life. There is something you were created for. But that logos, that reason, is not an abstract proposition.

It's a person that you know and love. It's Jesus Christ, and he's come into this world and you can know and love him. You know how revolutionary that was? If Jesus is the reason for life, that's what it means when it says,  in the beginning, was the logos. If Jesus is the reason for life, then I don't have to be a philosopher.

It's a certain that anybody can have a relationship with him. And it means that the meaning of life is not so much knowledge  and contemplation and philosophical knowledge. It's love. And therefore, let me ask you a question. Is Jesus the reason for your life?

Is Jesus the reason you get up in the morning? Is the reason you get out of bed? I'm not asking you to believe in Jesus. Do you pray to Jesus? Do you hope that Jesus will help you?

I mean, is he your very reason for life? Is he the whole reason you're living? He was yours. What do you think about that? Jesus was perfectly happy in heaven.

That was the point two here of the sermon. He was doing fine. He didn't need the trip. He was just fine. Why did he come?

Why did he go through all that? What was the very reason for his human life? It was you and me. His very reason for life was you and me. Now you go make him your reason for life.

It's only fair. And when you make him your reason for life,  the very reason that you live your life day to day. He'll fill you with love  and you'll become part of the solution  that this dark world needs instead of part of the problem. Let us pray. Our Father, we thank You that there is a light.

That light is the dynamic love and joy that You are capable of. And You make us capable of. We thank You that Your Son was willing to lose all that,  to lose all that joy, to lose all that love in order to bring us into it. And therefore, oh, we need light, but there is a light. And we pray that You would fill us with Your light and Your love.

And make us Your like Your Son. It's in His name that we pray. Amen.

### 中文翻译

### 引言：道

Tim Keller 正在查考约翰福音开篇的一段经文。约翰开始讲述基督的诞生，不是从牧羊人或天使开始，而是从道成肉身的奥秘开始。上帝自己以耶稣基督的身份进入世界，加入我们，Tim Keller 探讨耶稣诞生的意义。今晚的经文来自约翰福音第一章，第一到十一节。

> "太初有道，道与神同在，道就是神。这道太初与神同在。万物是借着他造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是借着他造的。生命在他里头，这生命就是人的光。光照在黑暗里，黑暗却不接受光。有一个人，是从神那里差来的，名叫约翰。这人来，为要作见证，就是为光作见证，叫众人因他可以信。他不是那光，乃是要为光作见证。那光是真光，照亮一切生在世上的人。他在世界，世界也是借着他造的，世界却不认识他。他到自己的地方来，自己的人倒不接待他。"

这是主的话。

### 对光的需求

好吧，我们将在将临期的几周内进行，这是圣诞节前的四周。我们正在查考约翰福音的第一章。我们一直在约翰福音第13到17章。我们正在查考第一章，因为约翰福音第一章是关于耶稣来到世界的。这基本上是约翰谈论圣诞意义的方式。即使关于这段非常非常著名的经文可以说很多事情，这里出现了七次光这个词。

**我们需要光，人类需要光，有光，然后我们如何与之连接，如何接受它。**

首先，尤其是第4和第5节中提到的光的需求，“生命在他里头，这生命就是人的光。光照在黑暗里，黑暗却不接受光。”

### 光的存在

现在，看这里的第4节，显然有光和灯，这里有灯，你看到灯。但在第9节中有一种被称为真光的东西，每个人都需要，在第4节中是人类的光，这意味着我们都需要一种光。

> "世界是一个黑暗的地方，我们不知道如何启蒙自己。"

### 与光的连接

当圣经谈论光和黑暗时，这种象征意义是什么？嗯，这真的很难，这就是它的意思。首先，黑暗有时意味着邪恶和痛苦。黑暗意味着邪恶和痛苦。我们谈论生活中的黑暗时期，所以我们处于生活中的黑暗地方。

**世界是一个黑暗的地方，世界继续拥有所有这些东西。**

但黑暗也可以意味着无知。你知道，如果我在一个黑暗的房间里，我不知道房间里有什么，我在绊倒，我在跌倒，因为我在黑暗中，意思是处于黑暗中可以意味着邪恶和痛苦。黑暗的意义，我看不到现实。

> "世界充满了邪恶和痛苦，我们没有能力或知识知道如何解决它。"

现在，这是你可能说的第一个线索，圣经所说的圣诞节的意义，耶稣来到世界的意义是。这是一个黑暗的世界，如果有光，它必须来自人类之外。

## Chinese Transcript / 中文

今天，提姆·凯勒带我们看约翰福音第一章的一段经文。约翰在讲述基督降生时，并没有从牧羊人或天使开始，而是从“道成了肉身”的奥秘开始：上帝自己以耶稣基督这位人的样式进入世界。现在让我们一同聆听提姆·凯勒如何阐述耶稣降生的意义。

今晚的经文出自约翰福音第一章1–11节：
“太初有道，道与神同在，道就是神。这道太初与神同在。万物是借着他造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是借着他造的。生命在他里头，这生命就是人的光。光照在黑暗里，黑暗却不接受光。”
“有一个人，是从神那里差来的，名叫约翰。这人来，为要作见证，就是为光作见证，叫众人因他可以信。他不是那光，乃是要为光作见证。那光是真光，照亮一切生在世上的人。他在世界，世界也是借着他造的，世界却不认识他。他到自己的地方来，自己的人倒不接待他。”

这是上帝的话语。

接下来几周将是将临期，也就是临近圣诞节的四个主日。这几周里，我们会来看约翰福音第一章。之前我们讲过约翰福音13到17章；而现在我们回到第一章，因为约翰福音第一章讲的是耶稣如何来到这个世界。

可以说，这是约翰谈论“圣诞节意义”的方式。虽然这段极其著名的经文可以说的内容很多很多，但这里有一个明显的线索：在这几节经文里，“光”这个词出现了七次。你看到我圈出来的地方了吗？能看见“only”（唯一）这个词吗？“光”出现了七次。

虽然段落里还会有其他主题，但我想我们需要问自己：这段经文在“光”这个主题上告诉了我们什么？你们都知道，“黑暗中的光”自古以来就是庆祝圣诞节的一种方式——点蜡烛、在树上挂灯、夜晚点灯，这些都是象征。那这些象征到底在讲什么呢？

让我们用一个很简单的结构来看这前11节经文：
它告诉我们，人类需要一位光，这光确实存在，而我们还需要知道如何与这光连结，如何接受这光。

我们需要光；有一位光；以及我们如何接受这光。

首先，是对光的需要，特别是第4、5节：“生命在他里头，这生命就是人的光。光照在黑暗里，黑暗却不接受光。”你看，第4节很明显提到有“光”，也有各种“灯光”；我们也看见灯光。但在第9节那里，有一个被称为“真光”的东西，是人人都需要的；在第4节也被称为“人的光”，这意味着有一种光是所有人都需要的。

然而，这几节经文同时告诉我们，我们与这位“真光”的关系——要怎么说呢？——非常紧张、非常复杂。因为稍后我们会看到，在第9、10节里，当真光来到世界时，人却拒绝了他。而在第5节，这里说到真光进入这个黑暗的世界，却说“黑暗却不接受光”。

如果你曾经读过不同译本，你会发现译者常常对这里的那个动词有不同翻译。有的译为“黑暗却不明白光”（comprehend）；旧一点的译本会说：“光照在黑暗里，黑暗却不明白它。”有的时候又会翻成“黑暗不能胜过光”（overcome）。

你会说：这两个意思差别蛮大啊。是，也不是。原文这是一个希腊词，但它是一个有意保持“多义性”的词，有点像英文里的“master”这个词。

想一想“to master something”可以是什么意思。有的时候，“master”是“制服、压制”的意思：你“战胜你的恐惧”，就是在对抗、压制、要把它消灭；你“掌控你的恐惧”，是要制服它、控制它、把它熄灭。

但如果你说你“master a subject”（精通一个学科），那你不是在消灭它，而是在理解它：“我已经掌握这个科目了，我了解它了。”

那这个词在这里到底是哪一个意思？其实这一个词同时有这两个意思，而且很可能是刻意含混的。也就是说，约翰要表达的是：人类需要一位“真光”，但我们对这光不仅是敌对的，同时也是一无所知的。

我们既敌对这光，又对这光茫然无知。

因此，这里实际上在说：世界是一个黑暗的地方，而我们没有能力让自己变得光明。

我们再往“光”这个意象深入一点。当圣经谈论“光与暗”的时候，这个象征是什么意思？其实并不难理解，就是你大概要想到的那些意思。

首先，“黑暗”有时指“邪恶和苦难”。黑暗代表邪恶与受苦。我们会说“人生的黑暗时期”“我现在在一个很黑暗的状态”，而邪恶与苦难可以有许许多多的形式。

耶稣降生的时候，如果你去看马太福音，它告诉我们：希律王得知有人出生，被称为预言中将来的王，他就下令屠杀伯利恒城里所有婴孩，确保没有未来的王位竞争者。马利亚和约瑟虽然逃走了，却被迫成了逃往埃及的难民。

所以你看到：有难民、有暴力、有不义、有战争，有悲痛、有忧伤、有破碎的家庭与丧亲——跟今天一样。世界是一个黑暗的地方，世上仍然充满这些东西。

因此，当我们说“黑暗”的时候，一方面意味着世界充满邪恶和苦难。

但“黑暗”还可以代表无知。如果我在一个黑屋子里，我看不见屋里有什么，就会一直绊倒、撞东西，因为我在黑暗里。“在黑暗中”意味着“看不见真实”。

因此，“世界是个黑暗的地方”同时也意味着：这个世界不仅充满邪恶和苦难，而且我们没有能力、也没有足够的知识去解决它。世界充满邪恶和苦难，而我们既没有能力也没有智慧知道如何解决它。

这就是圣经对“圣诞节意义”的第一个提示：耶稣来临的意义。那就是：这个世界是个黑暗的地方，如果要有光，光必须从人类之外而来。

马太引用以赛亚书的一段极其著名的经文——部分因为它被写进了韩德尔的《弥赛亚》——以赛亚书第9章说：“在黑暗中行走的百姓看见了大光；住在死荫之地的人，有光照耀他们。”马太用这段经文来描述耶稣来到世界：我们在黑暗中，而有一道光从人类之外照进来。

我想让你留意的是：我刚刚所说的这些，其实就是圣诞节传达的信息之一——世界是个黑暗之地，充满邪恶与苦难，而我们没有能力、也没有知识靠自己解决这些问题。如果要有光、要有帮助，它必须从人类之外而来。

而我们所生活的文化，几乎在每一方面都在训练我们不要相信这一点。我们所处的文化，在各个层面都在与之对抗。

这就带来一个问题：圣诞节不会消失，它已经成了一个巨大的商业盛宴，他们永远不可能把圣诞节取消——至少在可以预见的上千年里都不会。那么，当圣诞的信息与文化不断告诉我们的东西完全相反时，文化会怎么做呢？答案就是：文化会不断尝试“重新包装、重构”圣诞节。

比如几年前，我在《纽约时报》上看到一则圣诞广告，是一个公司在卖他们的产品，广告上写着：
“圣诞节的意义就是：爱终将得胜，我们终能共同建造一个合一和平的世界。”

这则广告的意思是：圣诞节的意义在于，如果我们大家一起努力，我们就能做到——我们可以创造一个合一和平的世界。注意，这正好与圣诞节真正的讯息相反。圣诞的信息不是“从他们那里升起了一道光”，而是“在他们之上有光照耀”——那光是从我们之外临到我们的。我们根本无法自己产生这种光，我们没有办法靠自己解决问题。

文化会不断尝试把这个信息改写掉，但终究不会成功。

瓦茨拉夫·哈维尔，捷克共和国的第一任总统，他既经历过社会主义，又活在自由市场资本主义之下。他曾说：这两者都不可能解决人类最根本的问题。他说，科技与科学可以告诉你“你能做什么”“怎样更有效率地去做”，却永远不能告诉你“你是否该做这件事”。

因此，他说，无论是科技、国家政府，还是市场，都不可能拯救我们脱离核冲突、环境恶化或种族暴力。他说：“追求美好生活本身，并不能帮助人类拯救自己；单靠民主也不够。人需要回转，寻求上帝。”人类不断忘记自己不是上帝——而这正是圣诞的信息。

所以，这世界是黑暗的，这是第一点。但第二点是：经文也告诉我们，确实有一位光。是的，这光来自人类之外，但这样的光的确存在，我们所需要的光确实在那儿。

那么，这光在哪里？我们再来看第1–3节。顺带一提，第14节（我们今天没有读到，将在之后几周细看）说到：“道成了肉身，住在我们中间”，也就是说，“神的道”就是耶稣。

稍后我会再回到“道”这个词，但现在你可以先把“耶稣”这个名字代进去。因为在本章后面，约翰清楚告诉我们，“神的道”就是另一个对耶稣的称呼。

所以，我们先这样读第1节：“太初有耶稣，耶稣与神同在，耶稣就是神。”

先停一下。这话对你可能很熟，但我要你看见，它其实是极其令人震惊的——当你把其中两个真理并排放在一起看的时候。

首先，它告诉我们：耶稣就是神。不是“耶稣是一位神”，而是“耶稣就是神”。原文希腊文这里没有冠词，不是“耶稣是一位神”，那样就意味着有不止一位神；而圣经并不是这么说的，而是说：“你所知道的那位神，独一的那位，耶稣就是那位神。”

但紧接着，它又说：耶稣是神，同时耶稣与神同在。“与……同在”这个词，表示一种关系。

如果你翻到福音书后面，比如马可福音，那里说到耶稣拣选十二门徒时，写着：“他就设立十二个人，要他们常和自己同在。”这里的“同在”，意味着与他一起生活、作他的亲密同伴，进入一个充满爱的关系、彼此沟通的关系。在圣经里，“与某人同在”是一个很强烈的关系用语，意味着最亲密的相交和爱。

因此，这里是在说：只有一位神，而耶稣是神；但同时，耶稣与神处在一个爱的关系里。耶稣是神，耶稣又与神同在。

虽然这里还没有提到圣灵，但圣灵在圣经别处也很清楚地被提及。所以我们看到的是：只有一位神，不是三位神，只有一位；但在这位神的里面，有父、子、圣灵三个位格，他们彼此相爱。

只有一位神，但在这一位神里面，有三个位格，从亘古到永远，彼此认识、彼此相爱。注意第3节说：“万物是借着他造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是借着他造的。”这意味着圣子、耶稣基督并不是被造的；一切被造之物都是借着他造的，这也意味着父、子、圣灵从永恒以来就彼此相知相爱，从来没有起点。

所以，只有基督教这样说：在神的最深处，神的本体里，是一个充满动态关系的爱。从亘古到永远，在神的存在里，一直有三个位格，他们彼此认识、彼此相爱、彼此荣耀、彼此赞美，从永恒以来不断地在相爱和沟通。神的内部有一个爆炸性的、动态的、无限强大的关系之流。

因此，生命的意义就是在关系中的爱。如果只有一位神、只有一个位格，后来才创造出其他受造物，那么“爱”就是后来才出现的东西：先有的是“能力、权能”，之后才有“爱”。

但如果神是三一的，是父、子、圣灵，从永恒以来就在彼此相爱，那“爱”就不是后来才有的，而是最先的，是最根本的；关系是最根本的；沟通是最根本的。

我们再往前推一步。我认为这段经文其实是要震撼我们，让我们惊叹：当圣经说“神就是爱”的时候，我们大概会下意识地想：“哦，那就是说神很有爱心、满有爱心。”但这里说的不仅仅是“神很有爱心”。更字面地说：在创造世界以前，在做任何事情之前，神本身就是爱——而且是一个动态的、彼此之间的爱，是朋友之间那样的互相关系。

在第18节（我们还没有读到，但很多人都很熟）那里说：“从来没有人看见神，只有在父怀里的独生子将他表明出来。”原文是“在父怀里的”（在父的胸膛里）。我认为约翰用这一语言，是刻意要我们运用想象力。那么，请你跟着我想象一下：

在你的人生中，有多少人可以在你躺在沙发上的时候，不用事先征求你同意，就直接走过来，躺在你旁边，整个人贴着你躺下，而你会觉得完全没问题？这样的人有多少？不会很多，对吧？而那些可以这么做的人，一定与你有着最亲密的关系。

我认为这正是约翰要我们做的：如果你想明白神是谁、神是怎样的一位，就必须开始回想你生命中那些“最被爱”的时刻。然后，把那种感受乘以万亿、万亿、再万亿次。

想象那一刻，你觉得自己最被理解、最被欣赏、最被珍视、最有安全感、最有价值的那种喜乐——你知道那种喜乐的感觉吗？然而，因为我们是自私的，我们很难长期停留在那种状态。即便你有一段相当不错的婚姻，那样的时刻也只是偶尔出现，因为我们天性里有自私，总想索取而不是付出，总想被服侍而不是服侍对方，因此那些“极致喜乐、极其被爱”的时刻，总是转瞬即逝、带着缺陷。

现在，请你想象三个位格，他们是完全完美的，始终以完全无私的爱彼此荣耀，从不说“你得服侍我”，反而不断地彼此服侍，彼此完全地、毫无保留地将自己给对方，从永恒到永恒。

你要把你人生中那些短暂的高光时刻乘以万亿、万亿、万亿倍，那就是神：神是无限快乐的，神是无限充满爱的。父、子、圣灵从永恒以来不断把喜乐、爱和荣耀倾倒在彼此里面，他们浸泡在彼此的喜乐中，浸泡在彼此的爱里，因此神是无限喜乐、无限幸福、无限慈爱的。

你知道他为什么要创造人吗？他为什么要照着自己的形象创造人？就是好让我们彼此之间、也与他一同分享这种爱。

你可能会问：这些跟“光”的主题有什么关系？答案是：关系重大。约翰在写书信的时候，在约翰一书1章5节说：“神就是光，在他毫无黑暗。”那“光”指什么呢？听上去很抽象，不是吗？“我们所需要的那光”到底是什么？

答案就是：刚才所描绘的这一切——这无限的、澎湃的爱，不仅是一种抽象的情绪，而是真实、活生生的互动和沟通，这就是那光。当约翰说“神就是光”的时候，听起来很抽象，但事实上，这光就是我们需要的：这种在神里面、在三一神之间流动的爱。

为什么？因为看看我们黑暗里的样子：世界上所有的邪恶和苦难——这个黑暗世界的一切黑暗，其实归根结底都是“缺乏爱”或“失去爱”。战争是什么？种族主义是什么？不义是什么？犯罪、暴力、离婚、破碎的家庭、丧亲、悲痛是什么？统统都是爱的失落、爱的缺席。

这就是我们的黑暗。而我们为什么没办法自己“发出光”？因为我们是自我中心的，我们心里总有一个声音在说：“我优先。”这也是人性最大的讽刺：我们渴望爱，知道爱是让生命有意义的东西——人临终时不会说“真希望我多加几班班、挣多一点钱”，而是会说：“我真希望多花时间陪我爱的人，多好好经营关系。”我们都知道，爱的确是生命的意义。

但与此同时，我们心里又有某种东西在说：“我要先顾自己，你来服侍我。”这就是爱的终结。爱是“你优先，我来服侍你；我把自己给你”。神就是这样，而且是无限地这样；因为神无限无私、无限慈爱，所以他是无限喜乐的——而我们不是，所以我们在黑暗中，我们需要那光。

在继续讨论“我们如何得着这光”之前，让我们先留意基督教对世界的理解与古代异教、现代世俗主义有多么不同。基督教相信，从起初就有一位位格性的神，父、子、圣灵，彼此相爱；而古代异教与现代世俗主义则非常不同。

古代异教认为，世界的起源是多位神祇之间的角力：有许多“权力中心”，他们彼此争战，世界因此被创造出来，某些事情因此发生。换句话说，古代异教认为，世界的本质是多重权力之间的斗争，是权力的角逐。

现代世俗主义则不相信有神，只相信一个“非人格”的宇宙，认为世界是通过暴力的自然力量形成的，人类则通过“适者生存”的过程演化而来——“血淋淋的自然界”，强者吞噬弱者。

所以，古代异教和现代世俗主义都在告诉你：宇宙的本质是权力与斗争。而基督教却说：太初有“同在”（with-ness），太初有彼此同在、彼此相爱的关系；起初有爱，无限的、永恒的爱——而这爱，就是我们需要的那光。

好，第三，既然如此，我们如何得到这光？如何实际地连结上？显然，整卷约翰福音后面的内容，都在回答这个问题。我们也要稍微往后看一点，但连在这几节里面，你已经能看到一个提示——在第9–11节：
“那光是真光，照亮一切生在世上的人。他在世界，世界也是借着他造的，世界却不认识他。他到自己的地方来，自己的人倒不接待他。”

这实际上在说一件很简单的事：耶稣基督来到世界，就是为了被拒绝。他清楚自己会被拒绝，而最终的拒绝不仅是“不接待”，而是“被杀害”。他来到自己所造的世界，我们是“属他的人”，因为他照着自己的形象造了我们——如果你造了某样东西，那就是你的，对吧？他造了我们，我们理应属他；他也是我们的真光，我们极其需要他，但世界却拒绝了他，把他钉在十字架上。

为什么？因为这就是我们内心的黑暗。我们想要爱，却害怕任何人进入我们的生命对我们说：“你要服侍我。”我们不想服侍任何人，我们的心说：“我要掌权。”因此，耶稣基督必须跨越我们与神之间的那堵隔墙。

圣经说，我们与神之间有一道隔断。耶稣怎么跨过这道墙？他上了十字架，在十字架上发生了两件事。首先，从外在看，黑暗降临了。那本来是正午，马太福音27章45节说，正在正午的时候，遍地都黑暗了。这是“光的世界”——那位“世上的光”——进入了黑暗中，这当然是一幅极具象征意义的画面。

同时，他也喊叫说：“我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？”（27:46）我们一直在把“光”与“爱”连起来，把“黑暗”与“自我中心”连起来。那么在十字架上发生了什么？外面黑暗了，里面也黑暗了——那就是爱的失落。

耶稣基督在十字架上承担了我们罪应得的刑罚。自我中心应得的惩罚是什么？其实自我中心本身就是惩罚，自我中心就是爱之失落。如果一对夫妻都自我中心，根本不用别人来罚款或者立个法规：“你们再自私就罚一千美元。”不需要，彼此的自私本身就会让他们一点一点失去爱，彼此疏离，关系瓦解。这在婚姻里是这样，在友谊里、在家庭里、在所有关系里都是如此。

因此，自我中心的刑罚，就是自我中心总会带来的结果：爱的失落。

但请注意，耶稣所经历的是什么。为什么他的痛苦足以为全世界的罪付上代价？为什么他承受的是所有人的惩罚？心理学家和辅导专家会告诉你——其实你不用他们告诉你，你本能地知道——世上最深的心理创伤、最剧烈的心痛，往往来自“失去配偶”，无论是死亡还是离异。那是爱的失落；因为那是一种极深的爱，是最亲密的关系之一，失去它是极大的痛苦。

但别忘了，即便你有一段60年的美满婚姻，两个人彼此的爱仍然是有限的。然而父与子之间的爱是从永恒以来、完全完美的。你能想象耶稣在十字架上所经历的痛苦吗？如果你在失去爱的时候就已经感到那样难以承受，而我们的爱又是如此有限，那么你可以想象，父与子之间永恒的、无限的爱被撕裂，会是怎样的撕心裂肺？

耶稣在十字架上的痛苦——那爱被撕裂的痛苦，比起你我所经历的任何痛苦，就好像核弹爆炸与橡皮筋“啪”一下的差别。就是那样的尺度差异。他为我们的罪而死。

而这正是我们可以连结那光的关键：客观上，我们的罪被赦免了。因此，当我说：“父啊，因着耶稣所做的饶恕我”，神就可以饶恕我的罪，并且进到我的生命里，开始把他的爱浇灌在我心里，使我开始变成一个真正有能力去爱别人的人，你也可以变成这样的人。

这就像金钱一样：当你连电费都快付不起时，要你慷慨施与是很难的；但如果你有很多钱，你至少有可能慷慨——虽然仍有许多人不愿意。但爱也类似：当你内心极度缺乏、极度饥渴时，要你不那么自我中心、去爱别人是非常难的；当你自己都觉得不被爱时，要你去爱别人就更困难。

然而，当神的爱借着十字架不断涌进你心里，当你看见耶稣为了爱你而失去了无限的爱，这会开始融化你的心、充满你的心，使你在爱里面“富足”，从而可以把爱给别人，而不只是怀着自私、操控的心态去对待别人。

所以，这是耶稣所做的。但你需要做的是什么呢？你需要让他成为你活着的理由。

我接下来要说的这两分钟，其实可以变成一整篇讲道。我想回到最开头那节：“太初有道，道与神同在，道就是神。”为什么耶稣被称为“道”？这里用的是希腊词“logos”（逻各斯），我们从中得到“logic”（逻辑）和“reason”（理性、理由）这些英文词。

当约翰说“耶稣是逻各斯”时，他是在刻意回应当时社会上一场极大的思想争论。希腊哲学家们相信，宇宙背后有一个“logos”，有一个“理性”或“秩序”，有一个“宇宙的道理”。要理解他们在说什么，可以这样想：

你如果不知道某个器具被造出来的“理由”（purpose），你就不知道该怎么用它。比如，如果我拿手表去钉钉子，我就会把手表弄坏。为什么？因为我没有顺着手表的“logos”来使用它——它被造的目的就是“报时”，不是拿来钉钉子的。如果你拿电暖器来煮饭，可能会把房子烧了；因为“电暖器的logos”不是拿来烹饪，而是用来加热空间的，你若不按着它的用途去用，就会出事。

希腊哲学家于是问：那人类生命有没有一个“logos”？这个世界有没有一个“logos”？有没有一种宇宙背后的根本“道理”？如果我们与这个“logos”保持一致，我们的人生就不会走偏？换句话说：人类有没有被造出来的根本目的？如果我们照着这个目的而活，人生就会走在正轨上？

他们对此争论不休。他们认为这个“logos”是一套命题、一种生活方式，所以有不同的哲学学派，你说“logos是这个”，我说“logos是那个”，也有人说“根本没有logos”。他们普遍认为，这个“logos”可以透过哲学思辨、理性推演来得到，只要你足够聪明，便可以理解“人应当如何活着”。

然后，约翰福音出现，把这一切都翻转了。约翰带来一个在人类思想史上极具革命性的观念：是的，宇宙确实有一个“logos”；是的，世界不是毫无意义的；是的，生命确实有一个被创造出来的目的。但这个“logos”、这个根本的“道理”并不是一个抽象命题，而是一位可以被你认识、被你爱的位格——就是耶稣基督，他已经进入这个世界，你可以认识他、爱他。

这有多么颠覆？如果耶稣是生命的“logos”，是“太初的那道”，那么我不需要成为哲学家才能找到生命意义；任何人都可以与他建立关系。生命的意义就不再是某种高深知识或哲学观念，而是一个爱的关系。

因此，我要问你：耶稣是你生命的理由吗？他是你早上起床、开始一天的原因吗？我不是在问你“你是否相信有耶稣”“你是否祷告求他帮助你”，而是问：耶稣是不是你活着的根本缘由？他是不是你整个人生的中心？

对他而言，你就是那样的“理由”。想一想：耶稣在天上本来无比快乐，这是我们第二点所讲的。他在那儿好得不得了，他并不需要这趟旅程。他完全不需要下到这个破碎的世界来受苦受死。

那他为什么来？为什么要经历这一切？他取人性来到世界，整个人类生命的理由是什么？就是你和我。他人性生命的中心目的，就是为你、为我而活。

现在，你去让他成为你活着的理由吧——这才公平。当你让他成为你生命真正的理由、你每天活着的中心，他就会把他的爱充满你，使你不再是问题的一部分，而成为这个黑暗世界迫切需要的那一部分答案。

让我们祷告：

父啊，我们感谢你，因为真有一位光。这光就是你在自己里面那动态的爱与喜乐，你也使我们可以活在其中。我们感谢你，因为你的儿子愿意为我们失去一切喜乐、失去一切爱，好把我们带进这光中。

因此，我们承认：我们需要光，而你已经赐下这光。求你将你的光、你的爱充满我们，使我们越来越像你的儿子耶稣基督。奉他的名祷告，阿们。

今天，提姆·凯勒带我们看约翰福音第一章的一段经文。约翰在讲述基督降生时，并没有从牧羊人或天使开始，而是从“道成了肉身”的奥秘开始：上帝自己以耶稣基督这位人的样式进入世界。现在让我们一同聆听提姆·凯勒如何阐述耶稣降生的意义。

今晚的经文出自约翰福音第一章1–11节：
“太初有道，道与神同在，道就是神。这道太初与神同在。万物是借着他造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是借着他造的。生命在他里头，这生命就是人的光。光照在黑暗里，黑暗却不接受光。”
“有一个人，是从神那里差来的，名叫约翰。这人来，为要作见证，就是为光作见证，叫众人因他可以信。他不是那光，乃是要为光作见证。那光是真光，照亮一切生在世上的人。他在世界，世界也是借着他造的，世界却不认识他。他到自己的地方来，自己的人倒不接待他。”

这是上帝的话语。

接下来几周将是将临期，也就是临近圣诞节的四个主日。这几周里，我们会来看约翰福音第一章。之前我们讲过约翰福音13到17章；现在我们回到第一章，因为第一章讲的是耶稣如何来到这个世界。

可以说，这是约翰谈论“圣诞节意义”的方式。虽然这段极其著名的经文可以说的内容很多很多，但这里有一个明显的线索：在这几节经文里，“光”这个词出现了七次。你看到我圈出来的地方了吗？能看见“only”（唯一）这个词吗？“光”出现了七次。

虽然段落里还会有其他主题，但我想我们需要问自己：这段经文在“光”这个主题上告诉了我们什么？你们都知道，“黑暗中的光”自古以来就是庆祝圣诞节的一种方式——点蜡烛、在树上挂灯、夜晚点灯，这些都是象征。那这些象征到底在讲什么呢？

让我们用一个很简单的结构来看这前11节经文：
它告诉我们，人类需要一位光，这光确实存在，而我们还需要知道如何与这光连结，如何接受这光。

我们需要光；有一位光；以及我们如何接受这光。

约翰福音这前几节经文告诉我们三件事：人需要光，这光确实存在，而我们还需要知道如何与这光连结、如何领受它。

我们需要光；有一位光；以及我们如何接受这光。

首先是对光的需要，特别是在第4、5节：“生命在他里头，这生命就是人的光。光照在黑暗里，黑暗却不接受光。”你看，第4节很明显区分了各种“光”：这里有灯光、有明亮的东西，我们都能看到这些“光”。但在第9节那里，有一个被称为“真光”的东西，是人人都需要的；在第4节也被称为“人的光”，这意味着有一种光是所有人都需要的。

然而，这几节经文也告诉我们，我们与这位“真光”的关系——要怎么形容呢？——是非常紧张、复杂的。因为正如稍后在第9、10节所说，当真光来到世界的时候，人拒绝了他。而在第5节，这里说真光照进这个黑暗的世界，却说“黑暗却不接受光”。

如果你用不止一个译本读过这段经文，你会发现译者们在这个词上常常给出非常不同的翻法。有的译作“黑暗却不明白它（不理解它）”；我记得旧译本里有一句：“光照在黑暗里，黑暗却不明白（comprehend）它。”有的时候又翻成“黑暗不能胜过光（overcome）”。

你会说：这两个意思差蛮多啊。是，也不是。原文这里是一个希腊词，但它带着一种“刻意保留多重含义”的特性，有点像英文里的“master”这个词。

想想“to master something”可以是什么意思。有的时候，“master”是“制服、压制”的意思：你“战胜你的恐惧”，就是在与之对抗、把它消灭，你在对付它、控制它、熄灭它。

但如果你说你“master a subject”（精通一个学科），那你不是在消灭它，而是在理解它：“我掌握了这门课，我懂了。”

那么，这里到底是哪一种意思呢？实际上，这个字同时包含着两方面的含义，而且很可能就是刻意这样用的。也就是说，约翰要表达的是：人类需要一位真光，但我们对这光既是敌对的，又是完全不理解的——我们既想压制它，又无法真正明白它。

那么，这个词到底是哪一个意思呢？其实，这个词两种意思都有，而且很可能就是刻意这样用的。这就意味着，约翰在说的是：有一位真光，是人类所需要的；但我们对这光不仅怀有敌意，而且也完全糊涂、摸不着头脑。

我们不但敌对这光，也对这光一无所知。

因此，这里实际上在说：世界是一个黑暗的地方，而我们不知道怎样让自己变得光明。

现在，我们再往“光”的意象深入一点。当圣经谈论“光与暗”的时候，它的象征是什么意思呢？其实并不难理解，基本就是你直觉上以为的那些含义。

首先，“黑暗”有时指“邪恶与受苦”。黑暗意味着邪恶和痛苦。我们说“人生的黑暗时期”“我现在在一个很黑暗的状态里”，而邪恶和痛苦有许许多多形式。

比如，当耶稣降生的时候，如果你翻到马太福音，就会看到：希律王听到有人出生，被说成是预言中将来的君王，他就下令屠杀伯利恒城里所有的婴孩，确保没有未来的王位竞争者。马利亚和约瑟虽然逃走了，却被迫逃往埃及成了难民。

所以你看到，有难民、有暴力、有不义，有战争、有悲痛、有忧伤、有破碎的家庭与丧亲——跟今天一样。世界是黑暗的地方，世界里一直充满这些东西。

因此，当我们说“黑暗”的时候，一方面意味着世界充满邪恶和苦难。

但“黑暗”还意味着无知。如果我在一个黑屋子里，我不知道屋里有什么，就会一直绊倒、摔跤，因为我在黑暗中。“在黑暗里”，既可以说是“处在邪恶和苦难中”，也可以意味着“看不见真实、看不清现实”。

所以，当我们说世界是一个黑暗的地方，也是在说：世界既充满邪恶和苦难，我们也没有能力、也没有知识知道该如何解决这一切。世界充满邪恶和苦难，而我们没有能力，也没有足够的智慧知道怎样解决它。

这就是圣经对“圣诞节意义”、对耶稣来到世界的意义所给出的第一个线索：这个世界是一个黑暗的地方；如果要有光出现，那光必须从人类之外而来。

马太福音引用了以赛亚书里一段非常著名的经文——部分因为它被写进了韩德尔的《弥赛亚》——以赛亚书第9章说：“在黑暗中行走的百姓看见了大光；住在死荫之地的人，有光照耀他们。”马太用这段经文来谈论耶稣来到世界：我们在黑暗中，而有一道大光从人类之外照进来。

我想让你留意的是：我刚刚所说的这一切，其实就是圣诞节信息之一：世界是黑暗的，充满邪恶与苦难，而我们没有能力、也没有知识靠自己解决这些问题。如果要有光、要有帮助，它必须从人类之外而来。

而我们所处的文化几乎在每一方面都在训练我们不要相信这一点，在各个层面都在与之对抗。这就带来一个问题：圣诞节不会消失，它已经成了一个巨大的商业盛宴，他们永远不可能把圣诞节取消——至少在可以预见的上千年里都不会。那么，当圣诞节真正的信息与文化不断告诉我们的东西完全相反时，会发生什么呢？答案就是：文化会不断尝试“重新包装、重构”圣诞节。

比如，几年前我在《纽约时报》上看到一则圣诞广告，是一个公司在卖产品，广告上写着：
“圣诞节的意义就是：爱终将得胜，我们终能共同建造一个合一和平的世界。”

这则广告是在说：圣诞节的意义在于，只要我们大家一起努力，我们就可以做成——我们可以创造一个合一和平的世界。注意，这恰恰与圣诞节真正的信息相反。因为圣诞的信息不是“从他们那里升起了一道光”，而是“在他们之上有光照耀”——那光是从我们之外临到的。我们根本不可能自己产生这种光，我们没有能力靠自己解决问题。

我们根本不知道怎么解决自己的问题，甚至连最基本的困境都无力处理，我们就是做不到。那则广告宣称的信息，其实正好与圣诞节真正的信息相反。

然而，尽管圣诞节真正的信息是如此，文化却会不断尝试重新塑造它，但终究无效。

捷克共和国首任总统瓦茨拉夫·哈维尔曾同时生活在社会主义体制下，也经历了自由市场资本主义。他说，这两者都无法解决人类最深层的问题。他指出，科技与科学可以告诉你“你能做什么”“怎样更有效率地做”，却永远不能告诉你“你是否该做这件事”。

因此，他说，无论是科技、国家政府，还是市场，都不可能拯救我们脱离核冲突、环境恶化或种族暴力。他还说过这样一句话：“追求美好生活本身，并不能帮助人类拯救自己；单靠民主也不够。人需要回转，寻求上帝。”人类不断忘记自己不是上帝——这正是圣诞节所传达的信息。

所以，这世界是黑暗的，这是第一点。但第二点是：这段经文也告诉我们，确实有一位光。是的，这光在我们人类之外，但这光的确存在，我们所需要的光是真的存在的。

那么，这光在哪里呢？我们再来看第1–3节。顺带一提，第14节（我们今天没有读到，接下来几周会讲到）说到，“道成了肉身，住在我们中间”，也就是说，“神的道”就是耶稣。

我稍后会再回到“道”这个词，但现在你可以先把“耶稣”这个名字代进去，因为在本章后面，约翰清楚说明，“神的道”是对耶稣的另一个称呼。

这样我们来读第1节：“太初有耶稣，耶稣与神同在，耶稣就是神。”

先停一下。这句话对你也许很熟，你可能听过很多次，但我要向你展示，它其实极其令人震惊——当你把这里给出的两个真理并排放在一起看的时候，就会发现这一点。

首先，它告诉我们：耶稣是神。它没有说“耶稣是一位神”，原文希腊文这里没有冠词，不是“耶稣是一位神”。

原文这里没有冠词，它并不是在说“耶稣基督是一位神”。而是说“耶稣基督就是神”。如果经文说“耶稣是一位神”，那就意味着有多位神了，对吗？但圣经不是这么说的；它说的是：你所认识的那位独一的真神——耶稣就是那一位。

然而紧接着，它又说：耶稣是神，耶稣与神同在。“与……同在”这个词，表示一种关系。

如果你翻到福音书后面，我想是在马可福音，那里说到耶稣拣选十二个门徒时，写着：“他就设立十二个人，要他们常和自己同在。”这里的“同在”，意味着与他一起生活、作他的亲近之人，进入一个充满爱的关系，一个最亲密的沟通与相爱的关系。在圣经里，“与某人同在”是一个关系用语，意味着与那个人处在关系之中。

因此，这里在说的是：只有一位神，耶稣是神，但耶稣同时又与神处在爱的关系里——耶稣是神，同时耶稣又与神相交。

尽管这里还没有提到圣灵，但圣灵在圣经别处很清楚地被提及。所以我们看到的是：只有一位神，不是三位神，只有一位；但在这一位神里面，有父、子、圣灵三个位格，他们彼此相爱。

只有一位神，但在这一位神的里面，有三个位格，从亘古到永远。留意经文说：“万物是借着他造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是借着他造的。”这意味着圣子——耶稣基督——不是被造的；一切曾经被造出来的，都是借着他造的。这也意味着父、子、圣灵从起初就彼此认识、彼此相爱、从未中断。

因此，只有基督教这样说：在神的核心、在神的本体里，是一个动态的关系。自永恒以来，在神的存在里一直有三个位格，他们彼此认识、彼此相爱、彼此荣耀、彼此敬慕，从永恒到永恒不断地在相爱和沟通。在神内部有一个爆发性的、动态的、无限强大的关系之流。

所以，

因此，生命的意义就是“在关系中的爱”。

想想看：如果只有一位神、只有一个位格，然后这位神后来才创造其他受造物，那么“爱”就是后来才出现的——先有的是能力、权能，之后才有“爱”，不是吗？如果只有一位神，只有一个“人位”，只有一个单一的位格，然后他创造了其他生命，那么在他创造出其他“人”之前，就没有真正意义上的“彼此相爱”，因为没有“对方”。所以先是权能，后来才有爱。

但如果这位神是三一的，是父、子、圣灵永恒同在、彼此相爱的神，那么“爱”从一开始就是存在的。“爱”是最根本、最重要的；关系是最重要的；沟通是最重要的。

我们再往前走一步：我认为这段经文是想把我们震惊一下，让我们惊叹。当圣经说“神就是爱”的时候，你我大概会直觉地想：“好吧，那就是指神很有爱心，很爱人。”不，不只是这样，远远比这更字面。

从永恒以来，在创造世界之前，在做任何事情之前，神本身就已经是“爱”——是动态的爱，是位格与位格之间的爱，是朋友之间的相交。

在第18节（我们刚才没读到，但很多人应该很熟悉，因为这段经文太有名了）那里说：“从来没有人看见神，只有在父怀里的独生子将他表明出来。”原文是“在父怀里”（在父的胸怀中）。我认为约翰使用这样的语言，是刻意要我们花一点时间来运用想象力。

所以，能不能请你和我一起想象一下？

（此处原录音插入了一个在2025年年底的事工代祷与奉献呼吁，内容提到播客、YouTube频道、广播、期刊、网站及未来的多语言翻译计划——这些是事工信息，不是讲道主体。）

我们非常感恩，有这么多人与你们一起同工，将基督之爱的福音传扬出去。谢谢你们。神也不断为我们打开新的机会，使我们可以拓展服事的方式。

在2026年，我们计划增加新的国际广播节目，拓展更多线上事工伙伴关系，出版新的书籍，并开始将凯勒牧师的讲道翻译成其他语言。

因此，在这一年即将结束的时候，我们邀请你为“福音与生命”（Gospel in Life）的事工祷告，也考虑在年终作出一笔奉献。我们所收到的年终奉献，将在很大程度上决定我们2026年的事工准备与拓展。你的支持，让我们能够把福音的信息带到两百多个国家，我们为你参与这项使命深表感激。

如果你想要奉献，可以访问 gospelonlife.com/give。请也为我们祷告，好叫我们能忠心管理这些奉献，使更多人藉着“福音与生命”的事工，认识基督为救主，找到盼望与喜乐。谢谢你与我们一同把基督的爱带给这个需要他的世界，因为福音真的能改变一切。

现在，让我们回到今天讲道的后半部分。

想一想，在你现在所活着的这个世界里，有多少人可以在你躺在沙发上的时候，不用先征得你同意，就走过来、直接躺在你旁边，整个人贴着你，而你会觉得完全没问题？

这样的人有多少？不会很多，对吧？而那些可以这么做的人，一定与你有着最亲密的关系。

我想，这正是约翰在邀请我们做的：如果你想知道神是谁、神是什么样的，你就得先回想你生命中那些你“最被爱”的时刻。然后，把那样的经历乘以万亿、万亿、再万亿次。

想象你生命中那个时刻，你觉得自己最被理解、最被欣赏、最被珍视、最有安全感、最有价值——你记得那种喜乐的感觉吗？然而，由于我们是自私的，我们几乎没办法一直停留在那样的状态里。即使你有一段很好的婚姻，那样的时刻也是来来去去。

即便是最好的婚姻，那样的时刻也只是偶尔出现，因为我们倾向于自私，倾向于不愿意付出，反而更想索取。

我们会彼此争吵，因此那些我们“最喜乐、最被爱、最被珍惜”的时刻，总是短暂的，对不对？也是不完整的，对不对？

现在请你想象，有三个位格，他们是完全完美的，他们总是在爱、在荣耀对方，从来不会说“你得服侍我”，反而不断地彼此服侍；他们从永恒以来，完全而彻底地把自己献给彼此。

你要把自己人生中那些短暂的高光时刻，乘以万亿、万亿、再万亿倍，那就是神。神是无限快乐的，神是无限慈爱的；神不断地经历着爱与喜乐。父、子、圣灵不断地向彼此的心里倾注喜乐、爱和荣耀，他们浸泡在彼此的喜乐中、浸泡在彼此的爱里面，因此他们是无限喜乐、无限幸福、无限慈爱的。

你知道神为什么要创造其他生命吗？为什么神要照着自己的形象创造人？就是要让我们可以彼此相爱，也与神一同享受这一切。

你也许会问：这些跟“光”的主题有什么关系？答案是：关系重大。

约翰不仅写了这卷福音书，也写了三封书信。在约翰一书1章5节里，他说：“神就是光，在他毫无黑暗。”那“光”是什么呢？听上去有点抽象，不是吗？

那“光”就是这里所描述的这一切：这无限的爱、跳动的爱，它不是一种模糊的情绪，而是真实、活生生的互动与沟通——这就是那光。

当约翰说“神是光”的时候，听起来很抽象，那么我们所需要的那光到底是什么？就是这个：这就是我们需要的。

为什么？因为看看我们自己的黑暗：世界上所有的邪恶和苦难——这个黑暗世界的一切黑暗，归根结底是什么？总是“缺乏爱”或“失去爱”。战争是什么？种族主义是什么？不义是什么？犯罪与暴力是什么？

离婚是什么？破碎的家庭是什么？丧亲是什么？忧伤是什么？痛苦是什么？这一切是什么呢？

无一例外，都是爱的失落、爱的缺席。总是如此，这就是我们的黑暗。

那我们为什么会有问题？为什么我们没办法自己“发出光”？因为我们是自我中心的。我们的心里总有某种声音在说：“先顾我。”这就是人性大的讽刺：我们渴望爱，比任何东西都更想要爱，我们知道那才是让生命有意义的东西。

你知道，没有人——我真的看过很多临终的人——没有人临终的时候会说：“真希望我多加几班班，多赚点钱。”他们不会这么说。他们说的是：“真希望我多花时间陪我所爱的人，多用心经营关系。”那才是生命的意义。

然而，与此同时，我们内心里又有某种东西在说：“先顾我；你来服侍我。”这就是爱的终结——因为爱其实是在说：“先顾你；我来服侍你。”而神就是这样，神无限地是这样；由于神无限无私、无限慈爱，他就是无限喜乐的。

我们没有这样的心，所以我们在黑暗里，我们需要那光。

顺带一提，在继续谈“我们如何得着这光”之前，我们先来想想基督教看世界的方式，有多么不同于古代异教和现代世俗主义。基督教相信，在太初有一位“位格性的神”：父、子、圣灵，从永恒以来彼此相爱。你知道这有多不同吗？

古代异教认为，世界是这样来的：有很多“权力中心”，称为“众神”，他们之间不断争斗，因而世界被创造、各种事情发生。换句话说，古代异教认为，在世界的最深处，是许多个权力中心彼此争斗——是一场权力之争。

现代世俗主义不再相信这些神祇，但相信一个“非人格”的宇宙，相信世界是通过暴力的自然力量形成的，人类演化则是“物竞天择、适者生存”的结果——“弱肉强食”的自然界，强者吞噬弱者。

所以，古代异教和现代世俗主义都在说：世界的本质是权力与争斗。而基督教却说：太初有“同在”（with-ness），太初有彼此同在的关系；太初有爱：无限的爱、永恒的爱、大能的爱——而这爱，就是我们需要的那光。

好，第三，我们如何得到这光？这一切是怎样临到我们的？

显然，既然这是约翰福音的开头，那么整卷约翰福音后面的内容，都在回答这个问题。不过，即便在这里，我们也已经看见一个提示——在9–11节：
“那光是真光，照亮一切生在世上的人。他在世界，世界也是借着他造的，世界却不认识他。他到自己的地方来，自己的人倒不接待他。”

这实际上在说一件很简单的事：耶稣基督来到世界，就是为了被拒绝。他知道自己会被拒绝。

而最终的拒绝不仅是“不接待他”而已，而是他们把他杀了。经文说“自己的人不接待他”，实际上他是被自己的人钉死的。他来到我们这里，我们是“属他的人”，因为第1、2节说是他造了我们。如果你造了某样东西，那就是你的；他造了我们，我们当然是属他的。

他不仅是我们的创造主，也是我们的真光，我们需要他，却把他拒绝了，把他钉在十字架上。

为什么？因为这就是我们内心的黑暗。我们想要爱，却害怕任何人走进来对我们说：“你要服侍我。”我们心里说：“不，我不想服侍任何人，我要掌权。”

所以，耶稣基督必须来跨越我们与神之间的那道隔墙。圣经说，我们与神之间有一道隔绝。耶稣是怎么做的呢？他来到十字架上，在十字架上发生了两件事：

第一，黑暗降临。那本来是正午——马太福音27章45节说，正在正午的时候，遍地都黑暗了。黑暗降临了。为什么？因为“世界的光”降入黑暗之中。

“世界的光”降入了黑暗之中——这外在的黑暗只是一个象征。

与此同时，他在十字架上呼喊——马太福音27章45节说黑暗降下，下一节27章46节说，他大声喊着说：“我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？”

你看，我们一直在把“光”与“爱”连在一起，把“黑暗”与“自我中心”连在一起。那我们就要问：在十字架上到底发生了什么？

从外在看，黑暗降临；从里面看，黑暗也降临——那就是爱的失落。耶稣基督上十字架，是在承担我们罪应得的刑罚。自我中心应得的惩罚是什么？其实，自我中心本身就是惩罚——就是爱的失落。

如果一对夫妻双方都很自私，根本不需要有人跑来说：“不许自私，再自私每天罚你一千美元。”不需要，因为他们已经在失去爱了，他们彼此疏远，那是很可怕的事。在友谊里也是这样，在家庭里也是，在一切关系里都是如此。

那么，自我中心该得的惩罚是什么？就是自我中心总会带来的那种惩罚：爱的失落。

但请看耶稣所经历的是怎样的一种失落。为什么耶稣的痛苦可以为全世界的罪付上代价？为什么他承担的是所有人的刑罚？辅导专家、心理学家会告诉你——其实你不用他们告诉，你本能也知道——世上没有比“失去配偶”更深的心理创伤了，无论是死亡还是离异，那都是爱的失落。

为什么这么痛？因为那是一种极深的爱，是最亲密的关系之一，失去它是非常可怕的经历。

但别忘了，即便你有一段60年的美满婚姻，即便你们之间的关系非常好，两个人彼此的爱仍然是有限的。但父与子之间的爱，是从永恒以来、完全完美的。

你能想象吗？如果你在失去爱的时候已经觉得不堪忍受——而我们对爱的经历又如此有限——那么，父与子之间那从亘古到永远的完美之爱，被撕裂的时候，那会是怎样的痛苦？

想一想耶稣在十字架上经历的痛苦，他那种失去爱的痛苦，比你我所经历过的任何痛苦都大得不可思议——就像核弹爆炸与一根橡皮筋被轻轻弹一下之间的差别那样巨大。他为我们的罪而死。

而这正是我们可以连结那光的关键：首先，从客观上说，我们的罪因此可以被赦免。所以，当我说：“父啊，求你因耶稣所做的饶恕我”，神就真的可以赦免我的罪，然后进入我的生命，开始用他的爱充满我。

这样，我就开始成为一个真正有能力去爱别人的人，而你也可以成为这样的人。

这就好像金钱：当你连电费都快付不起时，要你慷慨施与别人是非常难的。但如果你有很多钱，你至少有可能慷慨——虽然许多人仍然选择不慷慨。爱也是类似：当你里面极度缺乏、极度饥渴时，要你去爱别人、不那么自我中心，是很困难的；当你自己都觉得不被爱时，要你去爱别人就更难。

然而，当神的爱借着十字架开始不断涌进你心里，当你看见耶稣基督为了爱你而失去了无限的爱，这会开始融化你的心，开始充满你的心，使你在爱里面变得“富足”，从而可以把爱给别人，而不是总是带着自私或操控的心态去对待别人。

这就是耶稣所做的事；但你需要做的又是什么呢？你需要让他成为你活着的理由。

我接下来要说的这两分钟，其实可以变成一整篇讲道。我想回到最开头那句：“太初有道，道与神同在，道就是神。”为什么耶稣基督被称为“道”？这里用的是希腊语“logos”（逻各斯），我们从中得到“logic”（逻辑）、“reason”（理性、理由）这些英文词。

当约翰说“耶稣基督是逻各斯”的时候，他是在刻意回应当时社会上一个巨大的思想争论。因为希腊哲学家相信，宇宙背后有一个“logos”。

他们认为，在宇宙背后有一个“logos”，有一个“理由”、一个“秩序”。要理解他们的意思，可以这样想：

你如果不知道某一个器具被造出来的“理由”（purpose），你就不知道该怎样使用它。举例来说，如果我拿手表去钉钉子，我就会把手表弄坏。为什么？因为我没有按照手表的“logos”去使用它——它被造出来的目的是“报时”，不是拿来钉钉子的。

如果你拿电暖器来煮饭，有可能把公寓烧掉。为什么？因为电暖器的“logos”不是给你在上面煮东西，而是用来加热空间的；你若不按着它被造的目的去用，就会出事。

希腊哲学家于是问：那人类生命有没有一个“logos”？整个世界有没有一个“logos”？宇宙背后有没有一个“根本的道理”？如果有，而我们与这个“logos”保持一致，会不会就像与器具的“用途”对齐一样，使我们的人生运作得更好？换句话说：人类究竟有没有一个被造出来的目的？如果有，而我们照着这个目的而活，人生是否就会走上正轨？

他们对此争论不休。他们认为这个“logos”是一套命题、一种生活方式，不同的学派各自提出自己的“logos”。有的哲学家说：“我认为logos是这个。”另一派说：“不，我觉得logos是那个。”还有人说：“根本没有logos。”

但他们普遍认为，要靠哲学省思、靠理性沉思和推演，才能找到“人生的根本理由”，然后你要与之对齐，照着它去活。就在这时，约翰福音出现了，把这一切都翻转了。

约翰带来了一个在人类思想史上极具革命性的观念：是的，确实有一个“logos”；是的，宇宙并不是毫无意义的；是的，生命确实有一个“被造的理由”。但这个“logos”、这个根本的“理由”，并不是一个抽象的命题，而是一位可以被你认识、被你爱的位格——就是耶稣基督。他已经进入这个世界，你可以认识他、爱他。

你知道这有多么颠覆吗？如果耶稣就是“生命的理由”，这就是“太初有道”的含义——如果耶稣是生命的logos，是你存在的根本理由，那我就不需要成为哲学家才能找到生命的意义；任何人都可以与他建立关系。

这也意味着：生命的意义不再首先是知识、思辨或哲学的领悟，而是“爱”——一个关系。

所以，我要问你：耶稣是你活着的理由吗？他是你早上起床、开始新一天的原因吗？我不是在问你“你是否相信有耶稣”“你是否偶尔向他祷告，希望他帮助你”，而是问：他是不是你生命的根本缘由？是不是你活着的整个理由？

对他而言，你就是那样的“理由”。你想想：耶稣在天上本来无比快乐——这是我们第二点所讲的。他在那里好得不得了，他根本不需要这趟旅程，他一点也不缺乏。

那他为什么来？为什么要经历这一切？他取了人的样式来到世界，他整个人性生命的中心目的是什么？就是你和我。他活在世上的根本理由，就是为了你、为了我。

现在，该轮到你让他成为你活着的理由了——这才公平。当你让他成为你每天活着的理由、你人生真正的中心，他会用他的爱充满你，使你不再只是这个黑暗世界的问题的一部分，而是成为这个世界极其需要的那部分答案。

让我们祷告：

天父，我们感谢你，因为真有一位光。这光就是你在自己里面那动态的爱与喜乐，你也使我们有可能活在其中。我们感谢你，你的儿子甘愿为我们失去这一切喜乐，失去这一切爱，好把我们带进来。

因此，我们承认：我们需要光，而你已经赐下这光。求你用你的光、你的爱充满我们，使我们越来越像你的儿子耶稣基督。奉他的名祷告，阿们。
