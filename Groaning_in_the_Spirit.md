### Introduction: Longing for Change

Are you longing to see real change in your life, in your habits, your relationships, your heart? Today, Tim Keller explores how lasting change actually happens in the life of a Christian and why the Gospel offers a radically different process of transformation than anything else. The scripture is found in Romans 8 verses 13 through 27.

> "For if you live according to the sinful nature, you will die. But if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live."

**Because those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.**

### Part One: A Warning About Suffering

Now, this is an amazing passage very long, and I certainly can't take a look at every single thought unit, but in the middle, it talks about groaning. And this word groaning is a very, very strong word. It has, it's a word that means an expression of pain, and it even goes beyond that. In many cases, this word in Greek literature often is used to express the cry of someone who is facing death. It can be a death pain.

> "The creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed."

**Everything in this world is steadily, irreversibly, inexorably, unavoidably, falling apart.**

### Part Two: Three Resources for Suffering

#### 1. Prayer

When you suffer, you can process the suffering through prayer. Well, of course you say, everybody prays. But generally, when problems happen, it's emergency flare prayer. You know, it's like, if there's anybody up there help, you know, that's how we pray. This is talking about something else. Something very, very different.

#### 2. Pattern

Paul was a pastor and therefore I do understand this part because I'm a pastor too. Constantly, there are people who come to pastors and say, if God really loves me, why are all these problems happening to me? If God really loves me, why the tragedy, why the suffering?

#### 3. Perspective

Paul's constantly saying what you need in order to handle your suffering is hope. You need patience. He says you have to look to the future, but the best thing he says is it's amazing verse 18.

> "I consider that our present suffering is not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us."

### Part Three: Assurance of Resources

Finally, you say, well, wow, okay, but how do I know? I mean, you know, here you are a preacher and you're telling me that God sees me in Christ as a child. But listen, when I suffer, I don't feel that God loves me, or you say in the future, there's going to be this great glory, well, when I suffer, I don't feel it at all. It's unreal to me. I feel maybe even unworthy of it.

> "Because Jesus Christ was abandoned in his groaning, you never will be."

**Jesus Christ died on the cross, so someday God could enter end evil and suffering in this world without ending us.**

Let's pray. Thank you, Father, for giving us this set of resources and assuring us that they will work because of what your son did for us on the cross. Amen.

### 引言：渴望改变

你是否渴望在你的生活、习惯、关系和内心中看到真正的改变？今天，Tim Keller 探讨了基督徒生活中持久改变的实际发生方式，以及为什么福音提供了一种与其他任何东西截然不同的转变过程。经文出处是罗马书 8 章 13 到 27 节。

> "因为你们若顺从肉体活着，必要死；若靠着圣灵治死身体的恶行，必要活着。"

**因为凡被神的灵引导的，都是神的儿子。**

### 第一部分：关于苦难的警告

这是一个令人惊叹的段落，非常长，我当然不能看每一个思想单元，但在中间，它谈到了叹息。这个词“叹息”是一个非常非常强烈的词。它是一个表示痛苦的词，甚至超越了这一点。在许多情况下，这个词在希腊文学中常常用来表达面临死亡的人发出的哭声。它可以是一种死亡的痛苦。

> "受造之物切望等候神的众子显出来。"

**这个世界上的一切都在稳步地、不可逆转地、不可避免地、不可避免地崩溃。**

### 第二部分：应对苦难的三种资源

#### 1. 祷告

当你受苦时，你可以通过祷告来处理痛苦。当然，你会说，每个人都祷告。但通常，当问题发生时，那是紧急信号祷告。你知道，就像，如果上面有人帮忙，你知道，这就是我们的祷告方式。这是在谈论别的东西。非常非常不同的东西。

#### 2. 模式

保罗是一位牧师，因此我理解这一部分，因为我也是一位牧师。不断地，有人来找牧师说，如果神真的爱我，为什么所有这些问题都发生在我身上？如果神真的爱我，为什么会有悲剧，为什么会有苦难？

#### 3. 视角

保罗不断地说，你需要希望来处理你的苦难。你需要耐心。他说你必须展望未来，但他所说的最好的事情是惊人的第 18 节。

> "我想现在的苦楚若比起将来要显于我们的荣耀，就不足介意了。"

### 第三部分：资源的保证

最后，你说，哇，好吧，但我怎么知道？我的意思是，你知道，你是一个传道人，你告诉我神在基督里看我是一个孩子。但听着，当我受苦时，我感觉不到神爱我，或者你说将来会有这个伟大的荣耀，好吧，当我受苦时，我根本感觉不到。这对我来说是不真实的。我甚至觉得不配。

> "因为耶稣基督在他的叹息中被遗弃，你永远不会。"

**耶稣基督死在十字架上，所以有一天神可以在这个世界上结束邪恶和苦难而不结束我们。**

让我们祷告。感谢父，感谢你赐给我们这一套资源，并通过你儿子为我们在十字架上所做的事情来保证它们会起作用。阿门。
