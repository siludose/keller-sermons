## English Transcript / 英文原文

Today, Tim Keller explores how lasting change actually happens in the life of a Christian  and why the Gospel offers a radically different process of transformation than anything  else. The scripture is found in Romans 8 verses 13 through 27. For if you live according to the sinful nature, you will die. But if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live. Because those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.

For you did not receive a Spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received  the Spirit of sonship, and by Him we cry, all the Father. The Spirit Himself testifies with our Spirit that we are God's children. Now if we are children, then we are heirs, heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ. If indeed we share in His sufferings in order that we may also share in His glory, I consider  that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. The creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed.

For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of  the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its  bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God. We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right  up to the present time. Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as  we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. For in this hope we were saved, but hope that is seen as no hope at all, who hopes for  what he already has. But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently.

In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with  groans that words cannot express. And He who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit because the Spirit intercedes  for the saints in accordance with God's will. This is the Word of the Lord. We've been looking at Romans 678, which have to do with how the faith in Christ concretely,  but profoundly changes us.

And now we get here, as we're going through, Romans 678 to this subject of suffering. And it's absolutely crucial if your life is really going to be equipped in any spiritual  way for real life. We have to see how it is that faith in Christ or how it is that Christ actually does prepare  you to face the brutality, is the unavoidable brutality of life. Now why talk about this at Christmas time? Suffering at Christmas time?

I'll tell you why, because if you have a burden, if you're struggling with something, Christmas  time is the worst season, because you feel I'm the only one. Everybody else is happy, everybody else, but I'm the only one that's suffering. Of course, that's, as we're going to see, absolutely wrong, but it's very, very important  at this time, especially at Christmas time, to look at what this text teaches us. And it tells us three things. This text tells us, first of all, it gives us three things.

One, it gives us a warning about suffering. Secondly, it gives us three resources for suffering. And finally, it tells us how you can be sure that those resources will work. A warning about suffering, three resources for dealing with suffering, and how you can  be sure that they'll work. Okay?

First, a warning. Now, this is an amazing passage very long, and I certainly can't take a look at every single  thought unit, but in the middle, it talks about groaning. And this word groaning is a very, very strong word. And it has, it's a word that means an expression of pain, and it even goes beyond that. In many cases, this word in Greek literature often is used to express the cry of someone  who is facing death.

It can be a death pain. So, for example, you notice in verse 23, it's associated with a woman giving birth to  a child, and we have to remember, especially in ancient times, that a woman groaning, crying  out, screaming, really, as she's giving birth, is not just an expression of pain, but she's  also in mortal danger, that in old, in ancient times, many, many women died in childbirth. Also this word is used to refer to the groanings of warriors on the battlefield, you know, when  the fighting is done, and the smoke clears, and the noise of the battle itself is over. One of the most horrible things that so many veterans and first-hand observers of warfare  tells you, one of the most horrible things is the groaning of the people, of the soldiers,  of the warriors out on the ground. They're crying out, they're groaning, because they see their blood, their lives literally,  they're desperately wounded, they see their lives literally ebbing out, and they're crying  out, and they're groaning, and saying, please come and staunch the wound, or I'm dead.

Now, that's what this word means. It has that connotation, it's a death pain, it's a death  groan, and to our surprise, Paul actually speaks about the creation groaning. This world, this material  world, not just us groaning, we do too, but our material environment, the world itself, is groaning,  and it says it's groaning because it's crushed under a bondage to decay and the frustration. Now, what does that mean? It means this.

Everything, everything, not just us suffering, everything  in this world is steadily, irreversibly, inexorably, unavoidably, falling apart,  wearing down, wearing out, giving out everything. Now, we have this thing called the  Second Law of Thermodynamics, which actually confirms this, that the universe itself is deteriorating,  it's running down, it's spending far more energy than it's ever able to restore, and so everything's  deteriorating, but we can be much more personal than that. Your heart, your physical heart,  you realize it's not an electric clock that just goes on. Your physical heart is like a wind-up  clock, it's been wound up once, there's a finite number of ticks in it, and even as we speak,  is running out. Or your body, your whole body is falling apart.

Oh, we do awful lot to, you know,  retard or hide it. I mean, for example, one of the reasons you use cosmetics is you're trying  to restore the color and shame that you used to have naturally as a child. You had it once, you  didn't need the cosmetics, it's gone, it'll never come back. You can hide the process, some of you  can hide it extremely well, but you can't stop it. Or look at the closest circle of friends,  or the tightest family.

You know what time and circumstances doing? It's picking it apart. One by one time and circumstance is going to separate you, it's going to remove you from one  another. Now, what's the point? Well, here's the point.

We live in a culture in which suffering is  an anomaly. We think if you're savvy, if things are working right, we shouldn't suffer. We get,  when things, when we do suffer, we get angry. We think life is mistreating us, God's mistreating us,  somebody's mistreating us. But this text tells us, everything that your heart longs for,  everything that your heart longs for is a wave on the sand.

It's receding from you, inevitably  receding from you. It's all going to go. And you can, you know, for various, in various ways, you can  you can avoid suffering for a while, maybe even in the early 30s. But eventually, it is unavoidable. Real, bad, horrendous, groaning suffering.

It's just inevitable. It's unavoidable. So that's the lesson, a warning. You need resources. Don't  think, well, not if I'm smart, not if I'm savvy, not if I'm nimble.

You need resources at a point  two. What are these three resources? The three resources that Paul tells come with Jesus. You bring  Jesus into your life. You get these three resources.

We can name them under the headings, prayer,  pattern, perspective. Prayer, pattern, perspective. Okay, let's go through them. First of all,  prayer. When you suffer, you can process the suffering through prayer.

Well, of course you say,  everybody prays. I mean, there's that, I mean, you know, the statistics tell us, you know,  how many people, what a high percentage of people pray. And of course, there's that, I know it's  an exaggeration and it's kind of an unfair exaggeration. There are no atheists and foxholes. I know a number of atheists that are particularly irritated by that statement.

It's really not  fair. It's definitely an exaggeration, but it's trying to get at something. And that is that when  troubles happen, those of us who ordinarily don't pray, try. But generally, when problems happen,  it's emergency flare prayer. You know, it's like, if there's anybody up there help, you know, that's how  we pray.

This is talking about something else. Something very, very different. At the beginning  at the end of the passage, at the beginning of the passage, we are told about Abba prayer. Now, it says, you notice up here in verse 14 and 15, it says that you've received the spirit of  sonship and by him, that's the spirit, holy spirit, we cry Abba, Father. Now, what's the Abba?

That is  a universal language, you know, that in every culture, no matter what your culture, no matter what  your language background. Basically, when a little baby finally gives a name to one of the parents,  it always comes out kind of like this. Abba, Abba, Dada, something like that. What is this saying? Here's what it's saying.

It's saying that because of what Jesus Christ has done for you,  because of what it means to be in Jesus Christ, when you grow, when you cry, when you scream, even like  Job who cries out in rather unattractive ways, that when you cry in Christ, God the Father hears  that cry the way a parent hears the cry of his or her child. When your child screams and pain,  what do you do? You say, oh gosh, no. When you sense, I mean, you know, there's, listen,  there's all kinds of cries. There's, you get to know them after, you know, even I, you know,  even a father gets to know the cries, and there's, there's the I'm irritated cry where I want some  attention cry, and then there's the I'm in trouble cry.

And, and it's not like you love your child more  when your child gives the I'm in trouble cry. I mean, you can't really love your child more  principally, but your love is stirred. It's intensified. And this is telling us that even,  in spite of how you feel, when you're suffering, when you're in trouble,  you can know that God responds to your groaning the way a parent responds to the cry of pain  of his or her child. There's an intense love and intense care.

Absolutely. Can you code a God  with that kind of confidence of that kind of care, that kind of attention, that kind of love,  but that's not the only kind of prayer that we're given here. We're told not just about, you know,  Abba prayer, but look at the end. Very, very interesting and very little odd at first. It says  when we're weak, and when we do not know what we ought to pray for, the spirit himself intercedes  for us with groans that words cannot express the spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance  with God's will.

What is that talking about? Now, you know, some people have said that this is the  spirit helping you pray in tongues, and even though with all due respect to my charismatic  brothers and sisters, there's plenty of other passages that talk about tongues, but I don't  believe this is one of them because it's not talking about a sound that we make. This isn't us  making a sound. This is the spirit praying, not us praying. This is the spirit praying interceding,  means for us doing something in our place.

What is it? When we don't know how to pray,  the spirit lays out our petitions before the throne as they ought to be coming. Now,  some of you know this story. The first year out of college, I had a relationship with this girl,  and she wanted to break up. So I prayed so fervently in great groaning and pain, really.

Oh, Lord, please don't break up this relationship. Please don't break up this relationship. Now, of course, in hindsight, it was an absolutely stupid prayer. This is a different  girl than Kathy, who was my wife who I finally married, and it's a good thing that the relationship  broke up, but that's not how I felt at the time. So God didn't answer my prayers.

Is that right? I mean, he denied my prayers. Is that right? Yes and no, because listen, there's always a  core part to a prayer, and then there's the stupid part. And the core part, see the core part is  the groan.

The core part is help me. I think this is what I need to be the man you want me to be or  you know, the person you want me to be. I think this is what I need. And that's, you know, so please  help me be this and please give me this and please please help me. That's the core part.

And then  there's a stupid part. And I happen to think that this is the girl that will do that. And there's  a certain sense in which what? Did he answer my prayer or not? Wouldn't it be great if God always  gave you what you would have asked for if you knew everything he knows?

Wouldn't it be great if God  was so gracious that every time you prayed, he would give you and only give you thank goodness  because we're so stupid so often. Wouldn't it be great if you had a God who gave you and only gave  you what you would have asked for if you knew every single thing that he knew and you saw everything that  he could see? We do have a God like that because that's what that text is saying. It's saying the  spirit, even when you don't know how to pray, the spirit takes that core, the spirit prays as you  should be praying before the throne. And here's what this means.

When you suffer, can you come before  God with that kind of confidence to know that he is going to give you what you would have asked for? In spite of the fact that right now you probably don't think what he is letting you experience is  a good idea, but he is going to give you what you would have asked for if you knew everything that  he knew and he does care and he does love you. He loves you intensely. If you are able to process  your suffering before God like that, there will be a calm, there will be a groundedness. Okay,  that's your first resource, but that's not the only one.

There's another one. The second resource  is a pattern. Now what do we mean by a pattern? Well, Paul was a pastor and therefore I do understand  this part because I'm a pastor too. Constantly, there are people who come to pastors and say,  if God really loves me, why are all these problems happening to me?

If God really loves me, why the  tragedy, why the suffering? If he loves me in Jesus like you say, why all this? Paul in verse 17 turns  the tables. He doesn't say in verse 17, oh, suffering doesn't disprove the gospel. He doesn't just say  that.

He says, suffering is a sign that you're a Christian. It's not just, oh, you're a Christian  in spite of the suffering. He says, suffering is a sign you're a Christian. And look what he says. He says, now we're children if we share in his sufferings.

The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God. Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face  every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365 day devotional, the Songs of Jesus,  you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a  regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start. And if you already spend time  in study and prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest  emotions and questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with him.

Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash give  that's gospelandlife.com slash give. Suffering is a sign that we're his child. You say, well, wait a minute. I just let you  said, wasn't your point one?

After all, I do listen to you. Wasn't point one that everybody suffers  that it's inevitable. Notice his sufferings that lead to glory. What is that? There was a pattern  in Jesus' life.

The pattern in Jesus' life was rejection. You know, his family didn't understand him. His friends didn't understand him. He was despised. He was rejected.

He wasn't beautiful. He had  no form by which we should desire him. You know, he was a victim of injustice. I mean, he had one  one suffering after another after another. But his attitude was not my will but time be done.

He was faithful. He was trusting. He was obedient. And as a result, his death led to life,  his weakness led to strength. There was a death resurrection pattern.

And what Paul is saying is,  if you do the same, then you share in his sufferings. And what does that mean? It means the  things that come into your life actually change you. The weakness turns to strength. You know,  when you're doing bicep curls, do you know you're honestly actually getting stronger?

In spite of  the fact that it feels like it's getting weaker and weaker, it's getting stronger and stronger. Well, how does that happen? You know, I really don't understand physiology well enough to explain. Somebody out there, because this is New York, and there's all these smart people,  and there's a professional trainer, and you've got to tell me all about the amino acids and  your muscles or something. I don't know why, but I do know it's exactly this way.

When Paul says in  Romans 5, he just said it just a few verses before, now we always rejoice in our sufferings. By the  way, notice, he didn't say we rejoice for our sufferings. This is not massacism. This isn't  spiritual massacism. We, I'm suffering, no.

We always rejoice in our sufferings because we know  that our sufferings produce perseverance and perseverance character and character hope,  and hope does not disappoint us because God has poured out His love into our hearts by His Holy  Spirit, which He has given us. An acorn has got so much potential in it. You know, in the acorn,  there's enough power to create this huge tree with hundreds of other acorns, each of which  can produce a tree with hundreds of other acorns and hundreds of other acorns. In other words,  a single acorn has the power to cover the entire earth with wood. And yet, that acorn's potential can't be released unless it goes into the ground and dies,  and the Bible is constantly talking about that, unless you're humbled, unless you're broken  of your self-sufficiency.

You are the image of God, and you have potential for understanding and  wisdom and insight and compassion for other people. You have the potential for greatness and for joy,  real joy and hope and character. And what we're being told here is unless that goes into the soil  of difficulty and trial, without weakness, there will never be strength. Without death, there will  never be a resurrection, but it's possible if you share in His suffering, if you follow His pattern,  if you do it looking to Him, remembering Him, seeing what He did, following Him, believing in Him,  trusting Him, then what happens? What actually happens is you become a diamond under that pressure.

That's what it's saying. So first of all, you've got the processing through prayer. And if you process  it through prayer, then you have the hope of this pattern actually being reproduced in your life,  but that's not all. The third resource is prayer, pattern, perspective. And this is the most  powerful.

Paul's constantly saying what you need in order to handle your suffering is hope. You  need patience. He says you have to look to the future, but the best thing he says is it's amazing  verse 18. Now I consider, in that word consider means consider. It means it's a word, it's a Greek  word that means to reckon.

It means to count. It means it's an accounting word. It means to add it  up and to count on it and to think about it and reflect it and make sure you see every fast  and every aspect, every penny. I consider that our present suffering is not worth comparing with  the glory that will be revealed in us. Now we did a whole sermon series on this two years ago,  but here's the basic idea.

Imagine two rooms and you put two people in these two rooms and you give  them absolutely identical tasks. Menial, boring, difficult, manual labor. And you say you're going to  work 80 hours a day. You're going to have no vacation for 12 months in this room. It's going to be  boring.

It's going to be tedious. It's going to be so horribly hard. And so you put them both into  their into those rooms and they get started. And you say to the first guy, and at the end of the 12  months, you will get an annual salary $15,000 and you say to the second guy, and at the end of  the 12 months, you will get your annual salary $150 million. And those two guys are going to experience  that those identical circumstances in radically different ways.

Because the first guy after about  three or four weeks is going to say, who could take anything like this? This is so hard. It's driving me crazy. I can't take it anymore. I quit.

And the other guy is over there whistling. No problem. At all. Wait a minute. It's the same circumstances.

Why? Because the tediousness,  the difficulty, the trial of it, is being absolutely overshadowed outweighed by the glory that will be  revealed. In other words, how you experience your present is completely shaped by what you  believe your ultimate future to be. Completely. And if you rest the deepest hopes of your heart  in anything but God, if the deepest hopes of your heart is anything but God, if it's a political  cause, if it's a relationship, if it's anything, if it's a career, if it's writing the great American  novel, if you put the deepest hopes of your heart in anything but God, it's a thing of this world.

And it will be subject to suffering. And no matter how strong you think you are, no matter how  much you are stoic, no matter how stoic you are, suffering will take you out. And there will be an  anxiety ground note for your entire life. Your whole life will be characterized by a ground note  of anxiety. But if this is what you believe you're in for, what?

God's future and what is it? Oh,  my word. Oh my goodness. Do you see what it's saying? It says creation.

Now, creation is subject to the  K. Creation is awfully nice. I mean, when you look at the Grand Canyon, or you listen to the ocean,  or you look at the snow cap mountains, you know, it's pretty glorious. And yet this has the audacity  to say, the creation itself is just a shadow of what's going to be, just a shadow that's a disease  and the viruses and the nature, red and tooth and claws, is not what it originally was intended to be. So creation is groaning, right?

What's going to liberate it? Look what verse 21 says. It's waiting for our liberation. We are groaning inwardly for the redemption of our bodies. And so is nature.

In other words,  some kind of glory is going to come down on us on the last day. We are going to be so become so  radiant, so cleansed, so great. What do I mean by that? You know that if you have five senses and  somebody else has four senses like his blind or deaf or just like the difference between five  senses and four senses is huge. You know, in your ability to handle life and your ability to enjoy  life, the difference between five senses and four senses is huge.

But obviously when we're glorified,  we'll probably have a thousand senses. And what you're going to be like then, you know, compared to  what you are now compared to what you're going to be like then, you're a tomato. You know,  you're a zucchini. There's going to be a glory, almost like a bomb of glory that comes down on us  and it's going to be so astounding that it is going to transform material universe as well. Where it's our glory is going to bring nature with it.

And this is a material thing. The whole  idea is bodies, redeem bodies, a glorious creation. We're not just getting heaven, because see heaven  as great as heaven would be, an ethereal spiritual heaven, heaven would just be a consolation  for the life we've lost, or even the life we never had, but resurrection is the restoration of it. It's the undoing of everything that's wrong. It'll make everything sad come untrue, everything.

It's landscapes and it's hugs and it's feasts and it's not just getting back the things that we've lost. It's doing the things that we never could do. You know, it's writing finally the poetry of  always wanting to write. It's performing the music that you never were good enough to perform,  or to compose. And that's the reason why Lewis puts it like this in his great essay, The Weight of  Glory.

He says, if we take the scripture seriously, if we believe that God will one day give us the  morning star and cause us to put on the splendor of the sun, then we may surmise that both the ancient  myths and the modern poetry, so false's history will be very near the truth as prophecy. At present,  we are on the outside of the world. We're on the wrong side of the door. We discern the freshness  and purity and beauty of the morning, but they do not make us fresh and pure and beautiful. We cannot  mingle with the splendors we see, but all the pages of the New Testament are wrestling with the rumor  that it will not always be so.

Someday, God willing, we shall get in. And when human souls have  become as perfect and voluntary obedience as the inanimate creation is in its lifeless obedience,  then they will put on its glory, or rather that greater glory, yes, of which nature itself  is now only the first sketch. We are summoned to pass in through nature and beyond her into that glory  which she so fitfully reflects. Do you believe that? I don't believe it anything like I ought to,  but I'll tell you this, to the degree it's real to me in prayer, to the degree I grasp it and  understand it and think about it and celebrate it.

To that degree, it overshadows the tedious  circumstances of my life in that little room. Perspective, grasp it, prayer, process it,  and then you will find that suffering only reproduces the pattern of weakness into strength  and mediocrity into greatness of character in your life that you see in Jesus Christ, death,  into life. Now, finally, you say, well, wow, okay, but how do I know? I mean, you know, here you  are a preacher and you're telling me that God sees me in Christ as a child. But listen, when I  suffer, I don't feel that God loves me, or you say in the future, there's going to be this great glory,  well, when I suffer, I don't feel it at all.

It's unreal to me. I feel maybe even unworthy of it. How can I be sure these resources will work? Here's all I can tell you from this text. Notice it says  that the Spirit of God groans.

That's amazing. It's not just creation of groans and it's not just  we, the grown, the Spirit of God groans. And that's weird because remember, groaning, the word  grown means a death pain. It means a person in mortal danger of dying, it means a person in  enormous agony and pain. How can the Spirit of God, how can God who is immortal and eternal?

An omnipotent and infinite possibly grown. How could an omnipotent God know what it's like to be a  woman screaming out in labor knowing that she may be about to be giving her life in order to bring  a new life into the world? How could God know the agony and groaning of the warrior out on the  battlefield, crying out for rescue, but knowing he's probably just given his life for his people in battle  and he sees. How could God know that kind of suffering? How could that God know that kind of groaning  and pain?

You know what the answer is? Christmas. That's what Christmas is all about, you know? I know in  New York it's not, I mean what New York, New York surrounds you with Christmas, but of course New York  Christmas means shop, shop, shop, all right. But here's what Christmas really means that God was  plunged into an ocean of vulnerability.

He came into this groaning world. He came in and he was subject  to rejection and to weakness. He was subject to hunger. He's subject to alienation, to torture  eventually and a death. And there's a place in Mark chapter 7 when Jesus is healing a man who's a  deaf mute and he's a suffering man.

There's a place some of you might remember where Jesus looks to  heaven and it says he's size, but the word is literally in the Greek groaned. He's already groaning  because he's come into the world and he's standing alongside of sufferers and he's feeling, he's empathizing  with what they're going through, but it's on the cross that he went all the way because on the cross  Jesus Christ says, my God, my God, why has thou forsaken me? But he's quoting Psalm 22 verse 1 when he's  on the cross. He quotes a verse from Psalm 22 verse 1 and here's the whole verse. My God, my God,  why has thou forsaken me?

Why are you so far from saving me? Why are you so far from the words of my  groaning? Jesus Christ on the cross was a warrior on the ultimate battlefield. Isaiah 53 says he went  forth to hand, he went forth to face our enemies. Evil and sin and death and he was crushed by them  and now he's groaning, see, he's groaning, he's dying and he calls out and no one comes.

You know why? The Bible says this was God absorbing in himself the penalty that the human race has for all of the  evil that we've done to each other, to the world, even to God. He was paying the penalty of our  sins, so now you can know because Jesus Christ was abandoned in his groaning, you never will be  because Jesus Christ was forsaken in his death groan. When you groan, the Father hears it, the way  a mother or father hears the cry of a child and he loves you and he hears the inarticulate cry  and he takes the stupid part of the petition and drops it and he answers what you would have  asked for if you were smart enough to know and he surrounds you and he makes you something great  through the suffering and someday he's going to put an end to it. Jesus Christ died on the cross,  so someday God could enter end evil and suffering in this world without ending us.

Do you believe that? If you do, you can sing this one song out of Ralph Vaughan Williams,  there's a line in one of his songs where it goes like this. When the strife is fierce and the warfare  long steals on the ear the distant triumph song, then hearts are brave again and arms are strong. In the midst of the strife you think about that future, the distant triumph song, get the  perspective, process through prayer and the pattern of Jesus Christ will reproduce in your life,  that's how you can handle it, even in Christmas, let's pray. Thank you, Father, for giving us this  set of resources and assuring us that they will work because of what your son did for us on the cross.

Thank you for coming into the world, immersing yourself in our suffering,  at Christmas it must have been such a shock to the omnipotent soul of Jesus Christ to become a  helpless baby, to come into this world. But we thank you for doing that, and at Christmas  we draw all the infinite consolation and strength from it to face whatever life is  to us, and we thank you that we can do that through the Holy Spirit and through Jesus and his name  that we pray, amen.

Today, Tim Keller explores how lasting change actually happens in the life of a Christian  and why the Gospel offers a radically different process of transformation than anything  else. The scripture is found in Romans 8 verses 13 through 27. For if you live according to the sinful nature, you will die. But if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live. Because those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.

For you did not receive a Spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received  the Spirit of sonship, and by Him we cry, all the Father. The Spirit Himself testifies with our Spirit that we are God's children. Now if we are children, then we are heirs, heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ. If indeed we share in His sufferings in order that we may also share in His glory, I consider  that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. The creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed.

For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of  the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its  bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God. We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right  up to the present time. Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as  we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. For in this hope we were saved, but hope that is seen as no hope at all, who hopes for  what he already has. But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently.

In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with  groans that words cannot express. And He who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit because the Spirit intercedes  for the saints in accordance with God's will. This is the Word of the Lord. We've been looking at Romans 678, which have to do with how the faith in Christ concretely,  but profoundly changes us.

And now we get here, as we're going through, Romans 678 to this subject of suffering. And it's absolutely crucial if your life is really going to be equipped in any spiritual  way for real life. We have to see how it is that faith in Christ or how it is that Christ actually does prepare  you to face the brutality, is the unavoidable brutality of life. Now why talk about this at Christmas time? Suffering at Christmas time?

I'll tell you why, because if you have a burden, if you're struggling with something, Christmas  time is the worst season, because you feel I'm the only one. Everybody else is happy, everybody else, but I'm the only one that's suffering. Of course, that's, as we're going to see, absolutely wrong, but it's very, very important  at this time, especially at Christmas time, to look at what this text teaches us. And it tells us three things. This text tells us, first of all, it gives us three things.

One, it gives us a warning about suffering. Secondly, it gives us three resources for suffering. And finally, it tells us how you can be sure that those resources will work. A warning about suffering, three resources for dealing with suffering, and how you can  be sure that they'll work. Okay?

First, a warning. Now, this is an amazing passage very long, and I certainly can't take a look at every single  thought unit, but in the middle, it talks about groaning. And this word groaning is a very, very strong word. And it has, it's a word that means an expression of pain, and it even goes beyond that. In many cases, this word in Greek literature often is used to express the cry of someone  who is facing death.

It can be a death pain. So, for example, you notice in verse 23, it's associated with a woman giving birth to  a child, and we have to remember, especially in ancient times, that a woman groaning, crying  out, screaming, really, as she's giving birth, is not just an expression of pain, but she's  also in mortal danger, that in old, in ancient times, many, many women died in childbirth. Also this word is used to refer to the groanings of warriors on the battlefield, you know, when  the fighting is done, and the smoke clears, and the noise of the battle itself is over. One of the most horrible things that so many veterans and first-hand observers of warfare  tells you, one of the most horrible things is the groaning of the people, of the soldiers,  of the warriors out on the ground. They're crying out, they're groaning, because they see their blood, their lives literally,  they're desperately wounded, they see their lives literally ebbing out, and they're crying  out, and they're groaning, and saying, please come and staunch the wound, or I'm dead.

Now, that's what this word means. It has that connotation, it's a death pain, it's a death  groan, and to our surprise, Paul actually speaks about the creation groaning. This world, this material  world, not just us groaning, we do too, but our material environment, the world itself, is groaning,  and it says it's groaning because it's crushed under a bondage to decay and the frustration. Now, what does that mean? It means this.

Everything, everything, not just us suffering, everything  in this world is steadily, irreversibly, inexorably, unavoidably, falling apart,  wearing down, wearing out, giving out everything. Now, we have this thing called the  Second Law of Thermodynamics, which actually confirms this, that the universe itself is deteriorating,  it's running down, it's spending far more energy than it's ever able to restore, and so everything's  deteriorating, but we can be much more personal than that. Your heart, your physical heart,  you realize it's not an electric clock that just goes on. Your physical heart is like a wind-up  clock, it's been wound up once, there's a finite number of ticks in it, and even as we speak,  is running out. Or your body, your whole body is falling apart.

Oh, we do awful lot to, you know,  retard or hide it. I mean, for example, one of the reasons you use cosmetics is you're trying  to restore the color and shame that you used to have naturally as a child. You had it once, you  didn't need the cosmetics, it's gone, it'll never come back. You can hide the process, some of you  can hide it extremely well, but you can't stop it. Or look at the closest circle of friends,  or the tightest family.

You know what time and circumstances doing? It's picking it apart. One by one time and circumstance is going to separate you, it's going to remove you from one  another. Now, what's the point? Well, here's the point.

We live in a culture in which suffering is  an anomaly. We think if you're savvy, if things are working right, we shouldn't suffer. We get,  when things, when we do suffer, we get angry. We think life is mistreating us, God's mistreating us,  somebody's mistreating us. But this text tells us, everything that your heart longs for,  everything that your heart longs for is a wave on the sand.

It's receding from you, inevitably  receding from you. It's all going to go. And you can, you know, for various, in various ways, you can  you can avoid suffering for a while, maybe even in the early 30s. But eventually, it is unavoidable. Real, bad, horrendous, groaning suffering.

It's just inevitable. It's unavoidable. So that's the lesson, a warning. You need resources. Don't  think, well, not if I'm smart, not if I'm savvy, not if I'm nimble.

You need resources at a point  two. What are these three resources? The three resources that Paul tells come with Jesus. You bring  Jesus into your life. You get these three resources.

We can name them under the headings, prayer,  pattern, perspective. Prayer, pattern, perspective. Okay, let's go through them. First of all,  prayer. When you suffer, you can process the suffering through prayer.

Well, of course you say,  everybody prays. I mean, there's that, I mean, you know, the statistics tell us, you know,  how many people, what a high percentage of people pray. And of course, there's that, I know it's  an exaggeration and it's kind of an unfair exaggeration. There are no atheists and foxholes. I know a number of atheists that are particularly irritated by that statement.

It's really not  fair. It's definitely an exaggeration, but it's trying to get at something. And that is that when  troubles happen, those of us who ordinarily don't pray, try. But generally, when problems happen,  it's emergency flare prayer. You know, it's like, if there's anybody up there help, you know, that's how  we pray.

This is talking about something else. Something very, very different. At the beginning  at the end of the passage, at the beginning of the passage, we are told about Abba prayer. Now, it says, you notice up here in verse 14 and 15, it says that you've received the spirit of  sonship and by him, that's the spirit, holy spirit, we cry Abba, Father. Now, what's the Abba?

That is  a universal language, you know, that in every culture, no matter what your culture, no matter what  your language background. Basically, when a little baby finally gives a name to one of the parents,  it always comes out kind of like this. Abba, Abba, Dada, something like that. What is this saying? Here's what it's saying.

It's saying that because of what Jesus Christ has done for you,  because of what it means to be in Jesus Christ, when you grow, when you cry, when you scream, even like  Job who cries out in rather unattractive ways, that when you cry in Christ, God the Father hears  that cry the way a parent hears the cry of his or her child. When your child screams and pain,  what do you do? You say, oh gosh, no. When you sense, I mean, you know, there's, listen,  there's all kinds of cries. There's, you get to know them after, you know, even I, you know,  even a father gets to know the cries, and there's, there's the I'm irritated cry where I want some  attention cry, and then there's the I'm in trouble cry.

And, and it's not like you love your child more  when your child gives the I'm in trouble cry. I mean, you can't really love your child more  principally, but your love is stirred. It's intensified. And this is telling us that even,  in spite of how you feel, when you're suffering, when you're in trouble,  you can know that God responds to your groaning the way a parent responds to the cry of pain  of his or her child. There's an intense love and intense care.

Absolutely. Can you code a God  with that kind of confidence of that kind of care, that kind of attention, that kind of love,  but that's not the only kind of prayer that we're given here. We're told not just about, you know,  Abba prayer, but look at the end. Very, very interesting and very little odd at first. It says  when we're weak, and when we do not know what we ought to pray for, the spirit himself intercedes  for us with groans that words cannot express the spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance  with God's will.

What is that talking about? Now, you know, some people have said that this is the  spirit helping you pray in tongues, and even though with all due respect to my charismatic  brothers and sisters, there's plenty of other passages that talk about tongues, but I don't  believe this is one of them because it's not talking about a sound that we make. This isn't us  making a sound. This is the spirit praying, not us praying. This is the spirit praying interceding,  means for us doing something in our place.

What is it? When we don't know how to pray,  the spirit lays out our petitions before the throne as they ought to be coming. Now,  some of you know this story. The first year out of college, I had a relationship with this girl,  and she wanted to break up. So I prayed so fervently in great groaning and pain, really.

Oh, Lord, please don't break up this relationship. Please don't break up this relationship. Now, of course, in hindsight, it was an absolutely stupid prayer. This is a different  girl than Kathy, who was my wife who I finally married, and it's a good thing that the relationship  broke up, but that's not how I felt at the time. So God didn't answer my prayers.

Is that right? I mean, he denied my prayers. Is that right? Yes and no, because listen, there's always a  core part to a prayer, and then there's the stupid part. And the core part, see the core part is  the groan.

The core part is help me. I think this is what I need to be the man you want me to be or  you know, the person you want me to be. I think this is what I need. And that's, you know, so please  help me be this and please give me this and please please help me. That's the core part.

And then  there's a stupid part. And I happen to think that this is the girl that will do that. And there's  a certain sense in which what? Did he answer my prayer or not? Wouldn't it be great if God always  gave you what you would have asked for if you knew everything he knows?

Wouldn't it be great if God  was so gracious that every time you prayed, he would give you and only give you thank goodness  because we're so stupid so often. Wouldn't it be great if you had a God who gave you and only gave  you what you would have asked for if you knew every single thing that he knew and you saw everything that  he could see? We do have a God like that because that's what that text is saying. It's saying the  spirit, even when you don't know how to pray, the spirit takes that core, the spirit prays as you  should be praying before the throne. And here's what this means.

When you suffer, can you come before  God with that kind of confidence to know that he is going to give you what you would have asked for? In spite of the fact that right now you probably don't think what he is letting you experience is  a good idea, but he is going to give you what you would have asked for if you knew everything that  he knew and he does care and he does love you. He loves you intensely. If you are able to process  your suffering before God like that, there will be a calm, there will be a groundedness. Okay,  that's your first resource, but that's not the only one.

There's another one. The second resource  is a pattern. Now what do we mean by a pattern? Well, Paul was a pastor and therefore I do understand  this part because I'm a pastor too. Constantly, there are people who come to pastors and say,  if God really loves me, why are all these problems happening to me?

If God really loves me, why the  tragedy, why the suffering? If he loves me in Jesus like you say, why all this? Paul in verse 17 turns  the tables. He doesn't say in verse 17, oh, suffering doesn't disprove the gospel. He doesn't just say  that.

He says, suffering is a sign that you're a Christian. It's not just, oh, you're a Christian  in spite of the suffering. He says, suffering is a sign you're a Christian. And look what he says. He says, now we're children if we share in his sufferings.

The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God. Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face  every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365 day devotional, the Songs of Jesus,  you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a  regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start. And if you already spend time  in study and prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest  emotions and questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with him.

I just let you  said, wasn't your point one?

After all, I do listen to you. Wasn't point one that everybody suffers  that it's inevitable. Notice his sufferings that lead to glory. What is that? There was a pattern  in Jesus' life.

The pattern in Jesus' life was rejection. You know, his family didn't understand him. His friends didn't understand him. He was despised. He was rejected.

He wasn't beautiful. He had  no form by which we should desire him. You know, he was a victim of injustice. I mean, he had one  one suffering after another after another. But his attitude was not my will but time be done.

He was faithful. He was trusting. He was obedient. And as a result, his death led to life,  his weakness led to strength. There was a death resurrection pattern.

And what Paul is saying is,  if you do the same, then you share in his sufferings. And what does that mean? It means the  things that come into your life actually change you. The weakness turns to strength. You know,  when you're doing bicep curls, do you know you're honestly actually getting stronger?

In spite of  the fact that it feels like it's getting weaker and weaker, it's getting stronger and stronger. Well, how does that happen? You know, I really don't understand physiology well enough to explain. Somebody out there, because this is New York, and there's all these smart people,  and there's a professional trainer, and you've got to tell me all about the amino acids and  your muscles or something. I don't know why, but I do know it's exactly this way.

When Paul says in  Romans 5, he just said it just a few verses before, now we always rejoice in our sufferings. By the  way, notice, he didn't say we rejoice for our sufferings. This is not massacism. This isn't  spiritual massacism. We, I'm suffering, no.

We always rejoice in our sufferings because we know  that our sufferings produce perseverance and perseverance character and character hope,  and hope does not disappoint us because God has poured out His love into our hearts by His Holy  Spirit, which He has given us. An acorn has got so much potential in it. You know, in the acorn,  there's enough power to create this huge tree with hundreds of other acorns, each of which  can produce a tree with hundreds of other acorns and hundreds of other acorns. In other words,  a single acorn has the power to cover the entire earth with wood. And yet, that acorn's potential can't be released unless it goes into the ground and dies,  and the Bible is constantly talking about that, unless you're humbled, unless you're broken  of your self-sufficiency.

You are the image of God, and you have potential for understanding and  wisdom and insight and compassion for other people. You have the potential for greatness and for joy,  real joy and hope and character. And what we're being told here is unless that goes into the soil  of difficulty and trial, without weakness, there will never be strength. Without death, there will  never be a resurrection, but it's possible if you share in His suffering, if you follow His pattern,  if you do it looking to Him, remembering Him, seeing what He did, following Him, believing in Him,  trusting Him, then what happens? What actually happens is you become a diamond under that pressure.

That's what it's saying. So first of all, you've got the processing through prayer. And if you process  it through prayer, then you have the hope of this pattern actually being reproduced in your life,  but that's not all. The third resource is prayer, pattern, perspective. And this is the most  powerful.

Paul's constantly saying what you need in order to handle your suffering is hope. You  need patience. He says you have to look to the future, but the best thing he says is it's amazing  verse 18. Now I consider, in that word consider means consider. It means it's a word, it's a Greek  word that means to reckon.

It means to count. It means it's an accounting word. It means to add it  up and to count on it and to think about it and reflect it and make sure you see every fast  and every aspect, every penny. I consider that our present suffering is not worth comparing with  the glory that will be revealed in us. Now we did a whole sermon series on this two years ago,  but here's the basic idea.

Imagine two rooms and you put two people in these two rooms and you give  them absolutely identical tasks. Menial, boring, difficult, manual labor. And you say you're going to  work 80 hours a day. You're going to have no vacation for 12 months in this room. It's going to be  boring.

It's going to be tedious. It's going to be so horribly hard. And so you put them both into  their into those rooms and they get started. And you say to the first guy, and at the end of the 12  months, you will get an annual salary $15,000 and you say to the second guy, and at the end of  the 12 months, you will get your annual salary $150 million. And those two guys are going to experience  that those identical circumstances in radically different ways.

Because the first guy after about  three or four weeks is going to say, who could take anything like this? This is so hard. It's driving me crazy. I can't take it anymore. I quit.

And the other guy is over there whistling. No problem. At all. Wait a minute. It's the same circumstances.

Why? Because the tediousness,  the difficulty, the trial of it, is being absolutely overshadowed outweighed by the glory that will be  revealed. In other words, how you experience your present is completely shaped by what you  believe your ultimate future to be. Completely. And if you rest the deepest hopes of your heart  in anything but God, if the deepest hopes of your heart is anything but God, if it's a political  cause, if it's a relationship, if it's anything, if it's a career, if it's writing the great American  novel, if you put the deepest hopes of your heart in anything but God, it's a thing of this world.

And it will be subject to suffering. And no matter how strong you think you are, no matter how  much you are stoic, no matter how stoic you are, suffering will take you out. And there will be an  anxiety ground note for your entire life. Your whole life will be characterized by a ground note  of anxiety. But if this is what you believe you're in for, what?

God's future and what is it? Oh,  my word. Oh my goodness. Do you see what it's saying? It says creation.

Now, creation is subject to the  K. Creation is awfully nice. I mean, when you look at the Grand Canyon, or you listen to the ocean,  or you look at the snow cap mountains, you know, it's pretty glorious. And yet this has the audacity  to say, the creation itself is just a shadow of what's going to be, just a shadow that's a disease  and the viruses and the nature, red and tooth and claws, is not what it originally was intended to be. So creation is groaning, right?

What's going to liberate it? Look what verse 21 says. It's waiting for our liberation. We are groaning inwardly for the redemption of our bodies. And so is nature.

In other words,  some kind of glory is going to come down on us on the last day. We are going to be so become so  radiant, so cleansed, so great. What do I mean by that? You know that if you have five senses and  somebody else has four senses like his blind or deaf or just like the difference between five  senses and four senses is huge. You know, in your ability to handle life and your ability to enjoy  life, the difference between five senses and four senses is huge.

But obviously when we're glorified,  we'll probably have a thousand senses. And what you're going to be like then, you know, compared to  what you are now compared to what you're going to be like then, you're a tomato. You know,  you're a zucchini. There's going to be a glory, almost like a bomb of glory that comes down on us  and it's going to be so astounding that it is going to transform material universe as well. Where it's our glory is going to bring nature with it.

And this is a material thing. The whole  idea is bodies, redeem bodies, a glorious creation. We're not just getting heaven, because see heaven  as great as heaven would be, an ethereal spiritual heaven, heaven would just be a consolation  for the life we've lost, or even the life we never had, but resurrection is the restoration of it. It's the undoing of everything that's wrong. It'll make everything sad come untrue, everything.

It's landscapes and it's hugs and it's feasts and it's not just getting back the things that we've lost. It's doing the things that we never could do. You know, it's writing finally the poetry of  always wanting to write. It's performing the music that you never were good enough to perform,  or to compose. And that's the reason why Lewis puts it like this in his great essay, The Weight of  Glory.

He says, if we take the scripture seriously, if we believe that God will one day give us the  morning star and cause us to put on the splendor of the sun, then we may surmise that both the ancient  myths and the modern poetry, so false's history will be very near the truth as prophecy. At present,  we are on the outside of the world. We're on the wrong side of the door. We discern the freshness  and purity and beauty of the morning, but they do not make us fresh and pure and beautiful. We cannot  mingle with the splendors we see, but all the pages of the New Testament are wrestling with the rumor  that it will not always be so.

Someday, God willing, we shall get in. And when human souls have  become as perfect and voluntary obedience as the inanimate creation is in its lifeless obedience,  then they will put on its glory, or rather that greater glory, yes, of which nature itself  is now only the first sketch. We are summoned to pass in through nature and beyond her into that glory  which she so fitfully reflects. Do you believe that? I don't believe it anything like I ought to,  but I'll tell you this, to the degree it's real to me in prayer, to the degree I grasp it and  understand it and think about it and celebrate it.

To that degree, it overshadows the tedious  circumstances of my life in that little room. Perspective, grasp it, prayer, process it,  and then you will find that suffering only reproduces the pattern of weakness into strength  and mediocrity into greatness of character in your life that you see in Jesus Christ, death,  into life. Now, finally, you say, well, wow, okay, but how do I know? I mean, you know, here you  are a preacher and you're telling me that God sees me in Christ as a child. But listen, when I  suffer, I don't feel that God loves me, or you say in the future, there's going to be this great glory,  well, when I suffer, I don't feel it at all.

It's unreal to me. I feel maybe even unworthy of it. How can I be sure these resources will work? Here's all I can tell you from this text. Notice it says  that the Spirit of God groans.

That's amazing. It's not just creation of groans and it's not just  we, the grown, the Spirit of God groans. And that's weird because remember, groaning, the word  grown means a death pain. It means a person in mortal danger of dying, it means a person in  enormous agony and pain. How can the Spirit of God, how can God who is immortal and eternal?

An omnipotent and infinite possibly grown. How could an omnipotent God know what it's like to be a  woman screaming out in labor knowing that she may be about to be giving her life in order to bring  a new life into the world? How could God know the agony and groaning of the warrior out on the  battlefield, crying out for rescue, but knowing he's probably just given his life for his people in battle  and he sees. How could God know that kind of suffering? How could that God know that kind of groaning  and pain?

You know what the answer is? Christmas. That's what Christmas is all about, you know? I know in  New York it's not, I mean what New York, New York surrounds you with Christmas, but of course New York  Christmas means shop, shop, shop, all right. But here's what Christmas really means that God was  plunged into an ocean of vulnerability.

He came into this groaning world. He came in and he was subject  to rejection and to weakness. He was subject to hunger. He's subject to alienation, to torture  eventually and a death. And there's a place in Mark chapter 7 when Jesus is healing a man who's a  deaf mute and he's a suffering man.

There's a place some of you might remember where Jesus looks to  heaven and it says he's size, but the word is literally in the Greek groaned. He's already groaning  because he's come into the world and he's standing alongside of sufferers and he's feeling, he's empathizing  with what they're going through, but it's on the cross that he went all the way because on the cross  Jesus Christ says, my God, my God, why has thou forsaken me? But he's quoting Psalm 22 verse 1 when he's  on the cross. He quotes a verse from Psalm 22 verse 1 and here's the whole verse. My God, my God,  why has thou forsaken me?

Why are you so far from saving me? Why are you so far from the words of my  groaning? Jesus Christ on the cross was a warrior on the ultimate battlefield. Isaiah 53 says he went  forth to hand, he went forth to face our enemies. Evil and sin and death and he was crushed by them  and now he's groaning, see, he's groaning, he's dying and he calls out and no one comes.

You know why? The Bible says this was God absorbing in himself the penalty that the human race has for all of the  evil that we've done to each other, to the world, even to God. He was paying the penalty of our  sins, so now you can know because Jesus Christ was abandoned in his groaning, you never will be  because Jesus Christ was forsaken in his death groan. When you groan, the Father hears it, the way  a mother or father hears the cry of a child and he loves you and he hears the inarticulate cry  and he takes the stupid part of the petition and drops it and he answers what you would have  asked for if you were smart enough to know and he surrounds you and he makes you something great  through the suffering and someday he's going to put an end to it. Jesus Christ died on the cross,  so someday God could enter end evil and suffering in this world without ending us.

Do you believe that? If you do, you can sing this one song out of Ralph Vaughan Williams,  there's a line in one of his songs where it goes like this. When the strife is fierce and the warfare  long steals on the ear the distant triumph song, then hearts are brave again and arms are strong. In the midst of the strife you think about that future, the distant triumph song, get the  perspective, process through prayer and the pattern of Jesus Christ will reproduce in your life,  that's how you can handle it, even in Christmas, let's pray. Thank you, Father, for giving us this  set of resources and assuring us that they will work because of what your son did for us on the cross.

Thank you for coming into the world, immersing yourself in our suffering,  at Christmas it must have been such a shock to the omnipotent soul of Jesus Christ to become a  helpless baby, to come into this world. But we thank you for doing that, and at Christmas  we draw all the infinite consolation and strength from it to face whatever life is  to us, and we thank you that we can do that through the Holy Spirit and through Jesus and his name  that we pray, amen.

今天，提姆·凯勒探讨了基督徒生命中持久改变实际上如何发生，以及为什么福音提供了与其他任何东西截然不同的转变过程。经文出处是罗马书8章13到27节。

你们若顺从肉体活着，必要死；若靠着圣灵治死身体的恶行，必要活着。因为凡被神的灵引导的，都是神的儿子。

你们所受的不是奴仆的心，仍旧害怕；所受的乃是儿子的心，因此我们呼叫："阿爸，父！"圣灵与我们的心同证我们是神的儿女。既是儿女，便是后嗣，就是神的后嗣，和基督同作后嗣。如果我们和他一同受苦，也必和他一同得荣耀。我想，现在的苦楚若比起将来要显于我们的荣耀，就不足介意了。受造之物切望等候神的众子显出来。

因为受造之物服在虚空之下，不是自己愿意，乃是因那叫他如此的。但受造之物仍然指望脱离败坏的辖制，得享神儿女自由的荣耀。我们知道一切受造之物一同叹息、劳苦，直到如今。不但如此，就是我们这有圣灵初结果子的，也是自己心里叹息，等候得着儿子的名分，乃是我们的身体得赎。我们得救是在乎盼望。只是所见的盼望不是盼望。谁还盼望他所见的呢？但我们若盼望那所不见的，就必忍耐等候。

况且，我们的软弱有圣灵帮助；我们本不晓得当怎样祷告，只是圣灵亲自用说不出来的叹息替我们祷告。鉴察人心的，晓得圣灵的意思，因为圣灵照着神的旨意替圣徒祈求。这是主的话。

我们一直在查看罗马书6、7、8章，这些章节讲的是相信基督如何具体而深刻地改变我们。现在我们在逐步学习罗马书6、7、8章时来到了苦难这个主题。如果你的生命真的要在属灵方面预备好面对真实的生活，这是绝对关键的。我们必须看到，信靠基督如何使你准备好面对生活中不可避免的残酷。

为什么在圣诞节谈论苦难呢？我告诉你为什么，因为如果你有重担，如果你正在与什么事情挣扎，圣诞节是最糟糕的季节，因为你会觉得我是唯一一个。其他人都很快乐，其他人都……但只有我在受苦。当然，正如我们将看到的，这是完全错误的，但在这个时候，特别是在圣诞节，看看这段经文教导我们什么是非常非常重要的。

它告诉我们三件事。这段经文首先给我们三件事。第一，它给我们关于苦难的警告。第二，它给我们应对苦难的三种资源。最后，它告诉我们如何确信这些资源会起作用。关于苦难的警告，应对苦难的三种资源，以及如何确信它们会起作用。好吗？

首先，警告。这是一段很长的令人惊叹的经文，我当然不能查看每一个思想单元，但在中间，它谈到了叹息。这个词"叹息"是一个非常非常强烈的词。它是一个表示痛苦的词，甚至超越了这一点。在许多情况下，这个词在希腊文学中常常用来表达面临死亡的人发出的哭声。它可以是一种死亡的痛苦。

例如，你注意到在第23节，它与一个生产的妇女联系在一起，我们必须记住，特别是在古代，一个叹息、哭喊、真正尖叫的妇女，当她生产时，不仅是痛苦的表达，她还处于致命的危险中。在古代，许多许多妇女死于分娩。这个词也用于指战场上战士的叹息，你知道，当战斗结束，烟雾散去，战斗本身的噪音结束时。许多退伍军人和战争的第一手观察者告诉你，最可怕的事情之一是人们的叹息，士兵的叹息，战场上战士的叹息。他们在哭喊，他们在叹息，因为他们看到自己的血，他们的生命在流逝，他们受了重伤，他们看到自己的生命在一点点流逝，他们在哭喊，在叹息，说：请来止住伤口，否则我就死了。

这就是这个词的意思。它有那种含义，是一种死亡的痛苦，是一种死亡的叹息。令我们惊讶的是，保罗实际上谈到了受造之物在叹息。这个世界，这个物质世界，不仅是我们在叹息，我们也确实如此，但我们的物质环境，这个世界本身在叹息，经上说它在叹息，因为它被压在败坏和虚空的辖制之下。这是什么意思？意思是这样的。

这个世界上的一切，不仅是我们在受苦，这个世界上的一切都在稳步地、不可逆转地、不可避免地、无法逃避地崩溃、磨损、耗尽、衰竭，一切都是如此。现在，我们有所谓的热力学第二定律，它实际上证实了这一点，即宇宙本身正在恶化，它正在耗尽，它消耗的能量远远超过它能恢复的，所以一切都在恶化。但我们可以更个人化。你的心脏，你的生理心脏，你意识到它不是一个只是一直运转的电子钟。你的生理心脏就像一个上发条的钟，它只被上了一次发条，里面有有限次数的滴答声，即使在我们说话的时候，也在耗尽。或者你的身体，你的整个身体正在崩溃。

哦，我们做了很多努力来，你知道，减缓或掩盖它。例如，你使用化妆品的原因之一是你试图恢复你作为孩子时自然拥有的颜色和形态。你曾经拥有它，你不需要化妆品，它已经消失了，它永远不会回来。你可以隐藏这个过程，你们中的一些人可以隐藏得非常好，但你无法阻止它。或者看看最亲密的朋友圈，或者最紧密的家庭。你知道时间和环境在做什么吗？它在把它拆散。时间和环境将一个一个地把你们分开，把你们从彼此身边带走。

那么，重点是什么？重点是这样的。我们生活在一种文化中，苦难是一种反常现象。我们认为如果你精明，如果事情运作正常，我们就不应该受苦。当我们确实受苦时，我们会生气。我们认为生活在虐待我们，神在虐待我们，某人在虐待我们。但这段经文告诉我们，你的心所渴望的一切，你的心所渴望的一切都是沙滩上的一波浪。它正在从你身边不可避免地退去。它都会消失。你可以，你知道，通过各种方式，你可以暂时避免苦难，也许甚至在三十岁出头。但最终，它是不可避免的。真正的、糟糕的、可怕的、叹息的苦难。它是不可避免的。它是无法逃避的。所以这是教训，一个警告。你需要资源。不要认为，好吧，如果我不聪明，如果我不精明，如果我不灵活。你需要资源。

第二点。这三种资源是什么？保罗告诉我们与耶稣同来的三种资源。你把耶稣带入你的生命。你得到这三种资源。我们可以把它们归纳为：祷告、模式、视角。祷告、模式、视角。好的，让我们来看看。

首先，祷告。当你受苦时，你可以通过祷告来处理苦难。当然，你会说，每个人都祷告。我的意思是，有那个，我的意思是，你知道，统计数据告诉我们，你知道，有多少人，有多高比例的人祷告。当然，有那个——我知道这是夸张的，而且有点不公平的夸张——战壕里没有无神论者。我知道一些无神论者对那句话特别恼火。这真的不公平。这绝对是夸张，但它试图说明一些东西。那就是当麻烦发生时，那些平时不祷告的人会尝试。但通常，当问题发生时，那是紧急信号祷告。你知道，就像：如果上面有人，请帮忙，你知道，这就是我们祷告的方式。这是在说别的事情。非常非常不同的东西。

在经文的开头和结尾，在经文的开头，我们被告知"阿爸"祷告。你注意到在这里的第14和15节，它说你们所受的是儿子的心，借着他，就是圣灵，我们呼叫"阿爸，父"。现在，"阿爸"是什么？那是一种通用的语言，你知道，在每一种文化中，无论你的文化是什么，无论你的语言背景是什么。基本上，当一个小婴儿终于给父母之一起名字时，它总是出来像这样：阿爸，阿爸，爸爸，类似的东西。这是在说什么？这是这样说的。它在说，因为耶稣基督为你所做的，因为在耶稣基督里的意义，当你叹息，当你哭泣，当你尖叫，甚至像约伯那样以相当不吸引人的方式哭喊，当你在基督里哭喊时，父神听到那个哭喊，就像父母听到他或她的孩子的哭声一样。

当你的孩子因痛苦而尖叫时，你会怎么做？你说：哦，天哪，不。当你感觉到，我的意思是，你知道，有各种各样的哭声。有一些，你过一段时间就会认识它们，你知道，即使是我，你知道，即使是一个父亲也会认识这些哭声，有那种我很恼火的哭声，我想要一些关注的哭声，然后有那种我遇到麻烦了的哭声。而且，当你的孩子发出我遇到麻烦了的哭声时，这并不是说你更爱你的孩子。我的意思是，你不可能在原则上更爱你的孩子，但你的爱被激发了。它被强化了。

这告诉我们的是，尽管你感觉如何，当你受苦时，当你遇到麻烦时，你可以知道神回应你的叹息，就像父母回应他或她孩子的痛苦哭声一样。有一种强烈的爱和强烈的关怀。绝对如此。你能以那种信心来到神面前，那种关怀，那种关注，那种爱吗？但那不是我们这里被赐予的唯一一种祷告。我们被告知的不仅是，你知道，阿爸祷告，而且看看结尾。非常非常有趣，起初有点奇怪。

它说，当我们软弱的时候，当我们不晓得当怎样祷告的时候，圣灵亲自用说不出来的叹息替我们祷告，圣灵照着神的旨意替圣徒祈求。那是在说什么？现在，你知道，有些人说这是圣灵帮助你用方言祷告，虽然我尊重我的灵恩派弟兄姐妹，有很多其他的经文谈到方言，但我不认为这是其中之一，因为它不是在说我们发出的声音。这不是我们发出声音。这是圣灵在祷告，不是我们在祷告。这是圣灵在祷告、代求，意思是为我们做一些事情，代替我们做。

这是什么？当我们不知道如何祷告时，圣灵把我们的祈求按照应该的方式呈现在宝座前。现在，你们中的一些人知道这个故事。大学毕业后的第一年，我和一个女孩有一段关系，她想分手。所以我非常热切地祷告，真的是在极大的叹息和痛苦中。哦，主，请不要让这段关系结束。请不要让这段关系结束。现在，当然，事后看来，那是一个绝对愚蠢的祷告。这是一个与凯西不同的女孩，凯西是我最终娶的妻子，那段关系结束是件好事。但那不是我当时的感觉。所以神没有回答我的祷告。是这样吗？我的意思是，他拒绝了我的祷告。是这样吗？是的，也不是。

因为听着，祷告总是有一个核心部分，然后有愚蠢的部分。核心部分，看，核心部分是叹息。核心部分是帮助我。我想这就是我需要成为你要我成为的人的，或者你知道，你要我成为的人。我想这就是我需要的。那是，你知道，所以请帮助我成为这个，请给我这个，请请帮助我。那是核心部分。然后有愚蠢的部分。我碰巧认为这是那个会做到那一点的女孩。在某种意义上，什么？他回答了我的祷告吗？如果神总是给你你如果知道他所知道的一切就会祈求的东西，那不是很好吗？如果神如此恩慈，每次你祷告时，他都会给你，而且只给你——谢天谢地，因为我们经常这么愚蠢。如果你有一位神，他只给你你如果知道他所知道的每一件事、看到他能看到的一切就会祈求的东西，那不是很好吗？

我们确实有这样一位神，因为那就是那段经文在说的。它在说，圣灵，即使当你不知道如何祷告时，圣灵会把那个核心部分，圣灵会按照你应该祷告的方式在宝座前祷告。这是什么意思？当你受苦时，你能带着那种信心来到神面前吗？知道他会给你你如果足够聪明就会祈求的东西？尽管你现在可能不认为他让你经历的是个好主意，但他会给你你如果知道他所知道的一切就会祈求的东西，他确实关心，他确实爱你。他强烈地爱你。如果你能像那样在神面前处理你的苦难，就会有一种平静，一种踏实。好的，那是你的第一个资源，但那不是唯一的一个。

还有另一个。第二个资源是一种模式。我们说的模式是什么意思？好吧，保罗是一位牧师，因此我理解这部分，因为我也是一位牧师。不断地，有人来找牧师说：如果神真的爱我，为什么所有这些问题都发生在我身上？如果神真的像你说的那样在耶稣里爱我，为什么会有这一切？保罗在第17节扭转了局势。他在第17节没有说：哦，苦难并不能推翻福音。他不只是说那个。他说，苦难是你是基督徒的标志。不只是说，哦，你是基督徒，尽管有苦难。他说，苦难是你是基督徒的标志。看看他怎么说。他说，如果我们和他一同受苦，我们就是儿女。

诗篇可以深刻地塑造你亲近神的方式。甚至耶稣也依靠诗篇来面对每一种情况，包括死亡。在提姆和凯西·凯勒的365天灵修书《耶稣之歌》中，你会发现每天通过诗篇的阅读，带有新鲜的圣经洞见。如果你没有固定的灵修习惯，这本书是一个很好的开始方式。如果你已经花时间学习和祷告，那么阅读和通过诗篇祷告可以帮助你把你最深的情感和问题带到神面前，发现与他新层次的亲密关系。我们会寄给你提姆和凯西·凯勒的灵修书，作为你帮助福音与生活向更多人分享耶稣之爱的捐赠的感谢。今天就在gospelandlife.com/give领取你的副本。那是gospelandlife.com/give。

苦难是我们是他儿女的标志。你说，等一下。我听你说的了，你说的不是第一点吗？毕竟，我确实在听你的。第一点不是每个人都受苦，这是不可避免的吗？注意，是那导向荣耀的苦难。那是什么？在耶稣的生命中有一个模式。耶稣生命中的模式是被拒绝。你知道，他的家人不理解他。他的朋友不理解他。他被藐视。他被拒绝。他不俊美。他无佳形美容，使我们羡慕他。你知道，他是不公正的受害者。我的意思是，他经历了一个接一个的苦难。

但他的态度是：不要成就我的意思，只要成就你的意思。他是忠心的。他是信靠的。他是顺服的。结果，他的死导向了生命，他的软弱导向了力量。有一个死亡-复活的模式。保罗在说的是，如果你也这样做，那么你就与他的苦难有份。那是什么意思？这意味着进入你生命的事情实际上会改变你。软弱变成力量。你知道，当你做二头肌弯举时，你知道你实际上在变强吗？尽管感觉越来越弱，它实际上在变得越来越强。

这是怎么发生的？你知道，我真的不够了解生理学来解释。在座的某个人，因为这是纽约，有这么多聪明人，有一个专业的健身教练，你得告诉我关于氨基酸和你的肌肉或什么的。我不知道为什么，但我确实知道这正是这种方式。当保罗在罗马书5章说，他就在几节之前说过，现在我们在患难中也是欢喜的。顺便说一下，注意，他没有说我们为患难欢喜。这不是受虐狂。这不是属灵的受虐狂。我们，我在受苦，不。我们在患难中欢喜，因为我们知道患难生忍耐，忍耐生老练，老练生盼望，盼望不至于羞耻，因为神的爱已经藉着所赐给我们的圣灵浇灌在我们心里。

一颗橡子有如此多的潜力。你知道，在橡子里，有足够的力量创造一棵巨大的树，有数百颗其他的橡子，每颗都能长出一棵树，有数百颗其他的橡子，又有数百颗其他的橡子。换句话说，一颗橡子有力量覆盖整个地球。然而，那颗橡子的潜力不能被释放，除非它落在土里死了。圣经不断地谈论这一点，除非你被降卑，除非你被打破你的自足。你是神的形象，你有理解、智慧、洞察力和对他人同情的潜力。你有伟大、真正喜乐和盼望以及品格的潜力。

我们在这里被告知的是，除非它进入困难和试炼的土壤，没有软弱，就永远不会有力量。没有死亡，就永远不会有复活。但如果你与他的苦难有份，如果你跟随他的模式，如果你这样做是因为仰望他，记住他，看到他所做的，跟随他，相信他，信靠他，那会发生什么？实际发生的是你在那种压力下变成了一颗钻石。这就是它在说的。所以首先，你通过祷告来处理。如果你通过祷告来处理它，那么你就有希望看到这个模式实际上在你的生命中复制出来。

但那不是全部。第三个资源是祷告、模式、视角。这是最有力的。保罗不断地说，为了处理你的苦难，你需要盼望。你需要忍耐。他说你必须展望未来，但他所说的最好的事情是令人惊叹的第18节。现在我想，在那个词"想"中意味着思想。它是一个动词，是一个希腊词，意思是算计。它意味着数算。它是一个会计词。它意味着加起来，依靠它，思考它，反思它，确保你看到每一个方面，每一个细节，每一分钱。

我想现在的苦楚若比起将来要显于我们的荣耀，就不足介意了。两年前，我们做过一整个讲道系列关于这个，但基本的想法是这样的。想象两个房间，你把两个人放在这两个房间里，你给他们完全相同的任务。琐碎的、无聊的、困难的、体力劳动。你说你要每天工作80小时。你要12个月没有假期在这个房间里。它会很无聊。它会很乏味。它会非常非常艰难。所以你把他们都放进他们的房间，他们开始了。你对第一个人说，12个月结束时，你会得到年薪15000美元。你对第二个人说，12个月结束时，你会得到年薪1.5亿美元。

这两个人会以截然不同的方式经历那些相同的环境。因为第一个人大约三四周后会说：谁能忍受这样的事？这太难了。它让我疯狂。我受不了了。我不干了。另一个人在那边吹着口哨。完全没问题。等一下。环境是一样的。为什么？因为乏味、困难、试炼，被将来要显现的荣耀完全压倒了。

换句话说，你如何经历你的现在完全取决于你相信你的终极未来会是什么。完全如此。如果你把你内心最深的盼望放在神以外的任何东西上，如果你内心最深的盼望是神以外的任何东西，如果它是一个政治事业，如果它是一段关系，如果它是任何东西，如果它是一个事业，如果它是写伟大的美国小说，如果你把你内心最深的盼望放在神以外的任何东西上，那就是这个世界的东西。它会受到苦难的影响。不管你认为自己有多坚强，不管你有多坚忍，苦难会击垮你。你的整个生命会有一个焦虑的基调。你的整个生命会以一个焦虑的基调为特征。

但如果这就是你相信你将要进入的，那会是什么？哦，我的天。哦，天哪。你看到它在说什么吗？它说受造之物。现在，受造之物服在败坏之下。受造之物相当美好。我的意思是，当你看大峡谷，或者你听海洋，或者你看白雪皑皑的山峰，你知道，它相当壮观。然而这段经文有这种大胆说法，说受造之物本身只是将来要发生之事的影子，只是一个影子。有疾病和病毒，自然界充满血腥的争斗，不是它原本要成为的样子。所以受造之物在叹息，对吧？什么会释放它？

看第21节说什么。它在等候我们的释放。我们心里叹息，等候得着儿子的名分，乃是我们的身体得赎。受造之物也是如此。换句话说，某种荣耀将在末日降临在我们身上。我们将变得如此辉煌，如此洁净，如此伟大。那是什么意思？你知道，如果你有五种感官，而别人有四种感官，比如他是瞎的或聋的，五种感官和四种感官之间的差别是巨大的。你知道，你处理生活和享受生活的能力，五种感官和四种感官之间的差别是巨大的。但显然，当我们得荣耀时，我们可能会有一千种感官。

到那时你会是什么样子，你知道，与你现在的样子相比，与你到那时的样子相比，你现在只是一个番茄。你知道，你只是一个西葫芦。将会有一种荣耀，几乎像一颗荣耀的炸弹降临在我们身上，它将是如此惊人，以至于它将同时改变物质宇宙。我们的荣耀将带着自然界与它一起。这是一件物质的事情。整个想法是身体，得赎的身体，荣耀的创造。我们不只是得到天堂，因为看，天堂，无论天堂有多好，一个空灵的属灵的天堂，天堂只是对我们失去的生命的安慰，甚至是我们从未拥有过的生命的安慰。但复活是它的恢复。它是一切错误的纠正。它将使一切悲伤的事情变得不真实，一切。

这是风景，这是拥抱，这是宴席，这不只是找回我们失去的东西。这是做我们从未能做的事情。你知道，这是最终写出你一直想写的诗歌。这是表演你从来不够好来表演或创作的音乐。这就是为什么路易斯在他的伟大文章《荣耀的重量》中这样说。他说，如果我们认真对待圣经，如果我们相信神有一天会给我们晨星，让我们披上太阳的荣耀，那么我们可以推测，古老的神话和现代的诗歌，虽然作为历史是如此错误，但作为预言将非常接近真相。目前，我们在世界的外面。我们在门的错误一边。我们辨别出早晨的清新、纯洁和美丽，但它们没有使我们变得清新、纯洁和美丽。我们不能与我们所看到的辉煌融为一体，但新约的所有页面都在与这个传言搏斗：不会永远是这样的。

有一天，神愿意的话，我们将会进去。当人类的灵魂变得像无生命的受造之物在其无生命的顺服中那样完美和自愿地顺服时，他们将披上它的荣耀，或者更确切地说，那更大的荣耀，是的，自然界本身现在只是它的第一幅草图。我们被召唤穿过自然界，超越她，进入那她如此微弱地反映的荣耀。你相信这个吗？我不像我应该的那样相信它，但我告诉你这一点，当它在祷告中对我是真实的时候，当我抓住它、理解它、思考它、庆祝它的程度。在那种程度上，它压倒了我在那个小房间里单调生活的环境。视角，抓住它，祷告，处理它，然后你会发现苦难只是在你的生命中复制你在耶稣基督身上看到的软弱变成力量、平庸变成伟大品格的模式，死亡变成生命。

现在，最后，你说，哇，好吧，但我怎么知道？我的意思是，你知道，你是一个传道人，你告诉我神在基督里看我是一个孩子。但听着，当我受苦时，我感觉不到神爱我，或者你说将来会有这个伟大的荣耀，好吧，当我受苦时，我根本感觉不到。这对我来说是不真实的。我甚至觉得不配。我怎么能确信这些资源会起作用？从这段经文中我能告诉你的是，注意它说神的灵叹息。这是令人惊奇的。不只是受造之物叹息，不只是我们叹息，神的灵叹息。这很奇怪，因为记住，叹息这个词意味着死亡的痛苦。它意味着一个处于致命危险中的人，它意味着一个处于极大痛苦中的人。

不朽的、永恒的、全能的、无限的神怎么可能叹息？一位全能的神怎么可能知道一个妇女在分娩中尖叫、知道她可能正在为了把新生命带到世上而献出自己的生命的感觉？神怎么可能知道战场上战士的痛苦和叹息，为救援而呼喊，但知道他可能刚刚为他的人民在战斗中献出了生命，他看到了。神怎么可能知道那种苦难？神怎么可能知道那种叹息和痛苦？你知道答案是什么吗？圣诞节。

这就是圣诞节的全部意义，你知道吗？我知道在纽约不是这样，我的意思是纽约圣诞节意味着购物、购物、购物，好吧。但这是圣诞节真正的意义，神投入了脆弱的海洋。他进入了这个叹息的世界。他进来了，他服从于被拒绝和软弱。他服从于饥饿。他服从于疏离、折磨，最终是死亡。在马可福音第7章，当耶稣医治一个又聋又哑的人，一个受苦的人时，有一个地方你们中的一些人可能记得，耶稣望天叹息，但那个词在希腊语中实际上是叹息。他已经在叹息，因为他进入了这个世界，他站在受苦者身旁，他在感受、同情他们正在经历的。

但正是在十字架上，他走完了全程，因为在十字架上耶稣基督说：我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？但他在十字架上引用的是诗篇22篇第1节。他引用了诗篇22篇第1节的一节经文，这是完整的一节。我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？你为什么远离不救我？你为什么远离我叹息的言语？耶稣基督在十字架上是在终极战场上的战士。以赛亚书53章说他出去面对我们的敌人。邪恶、罪和死亡，他被它们压碎，现在他在叹息，看，他在叹息，他在死去，他呼求，却没有人来。

你知道为什么吗？圣经说这是神在自己身上承担人类因我们彼此所做的一切邪恶、对世界所做的、甚至对神所做的而应受的刑罚。他在为我们的罪付代价，所以现在你可以知道，因为耶稣基督在他的叹息中被离弃，你永远不会。因为耶稣基督在他的死亡叹息中被离弃。当你叹息时，父听到它，就像父亲或母亲听到孩子的哭声一样，他爱你，他听到那不清楚的哭声，他取走愚蠢的部分，丢弃它，他回答你如果足够聪明就会祈求的东西。他围绕着你，通过苦难使你成为伟大的人，有一天他会结束这一切。耶稣基督死在十字架上，所以有一天神可以结束这个世界上的邪恶和苦难而不结束我们。

你相信这个吗？如果你相信，你可以唱拉尔夫·沃恩·威廉姆斯的这首歌，他的一首歌中有一句歌词是这样的：当斗争激烈、战争漫长时，远处的胜利之歌飘入耳中，然后心又变得勇敢，臂膀又变得有力。在斗争中，你想着那未来，那远处的胜利之歌，获得视角，通过祷告来处理，耶稣基督的模式就会在你的生命中复制出来，这就是你处理它的方式，即使在圣诞节。让我们祷告。

感谢你，父，赐给我们这套资源，并向我们保证它们会起作用，因为你的儿子为我们在十字架上所做的。感谢你进入这个世界，把自己投入我们的苦难中。在圣诞节，对耶稣基督全能的灵魂来说，成为一个无助的婴儿，来到这个世界，一定是多么震惊。但我们感谢你这样做，在圣诞节，我们从中汲取无限的安慰和力量，来面对生活向我们投掷的任何东西，我们感谢你，我们可以通过圣灵和耶稣来做到这一点，奉他的名我们祷告，阿门。
