today's podcast where Tim Keller explores the person and promises of Jesus Christ.  2 Corinthians 10, 1-6. This is Paul speaking. By the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I appeal to you, I, Paul, who am timid when  face to face with you, but bold went away. I beg you that when I come I may not have to be as bold as I expect to be toward some  people who think that we live by the standards of this world. For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does.

The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world, on the contrary. They have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments in every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of  God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ. And we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience once your obedience is complete. And this is God's word.

We've been talking about Jesus as prophet, priest, and king. There's a place in Matthew 12 where Jesus says, the men of Nineveh will stand up in judgment  and condemn this generation. For they repented at the preaching of Jonah and behold a greater than Jonah is here. And the queen of the south will rise up on the judgment day and condemn this generation  for she came from the ends of the earth to Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon  is here. That's a very dramatic statement.

And you see what he's saying? He is saying, a greater than Jonah, I'm the ultimate prophet, a greater than Aaron or  Moses on the ultimate priest, a greater than Solomon on the ultimate king. That's quite a challenge, and that's quite a claim. But what we're going to look at here tonight is what does that mean? Now it shouldn't come of surprise to you that historically Christians and people who  have studied the Bible have seen that Jesus Christ executes his office.

That means he carries out his office of king in two different ways. He carries it out spiritually in the hearts of his people and he carries it out cosmically  in history. And we're not going to talk about the second ones tonight. We're going to talk about the first one. Because what we have here is an interesting description of how Jesus Christ approaches  the human heart.

What does it say? It says, though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does. The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world in the contrary. They have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments and every pretension it sets itself up against the knowledge of  God and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.

What is this describing? First of all, what is describing implicitly and then secondly, what is describing explicitly? Implicitly, tacitly, in other words, it's unstated but completely assumed and therefore  taught in the passage that Jesus Christ is king. And the reason we say Jesus Christ is king is because it says every thought has to be obedient  to Christ. Every thought.

My neighbor comes to me and asks me for a cup of sugar. And if I say no to my neighbor, I may be unkind, I may be rude, I may be uncompassionate,  I may be a bad neighbor but I'm not disobedient. You're only disobedient if you owe something to somebody, if that person has some rights  over you. And the fact that every thought, not just part but every thought of my life and my heart,  every dimension therefore of my being has to be made obedient to Christ means he's my absolute  monarch. So for example, I may have to be obedient to the police officer, why?

Well, it's part of what it means to be a citizen of the city. The police officer asked me to do something and I should obey because in a certain narrow  focus or scope, in a certain narrow scope, the police officer has rights over me. Now, it's all part of the social contract, it's all part of what it means when I decide  to live in a place like New York City and when I become a citizen of the United States  and when I elect representatives and they appoint this and they appoint that, the police officer  cannot tell me who to marry. At that point, the police officer is making a suggestion. The police officer says, I want you to marry my sister-in-law or I'm going to give you  a ticket.

You can't do that. He's got a scope. He says, you must do this when you get to that stop sign or I'm going to run you in. He has the right to do that. He has rights over me.

So there is a part of my life in which I have to obey the police officer and then of  course you can talk about all sorts of relationships we have in which we owe things to people. A person who's done a great deed for you, a good friend. And very often, if that person is sacrificed for you and you know that that person has done  something for you, you sense a certain moral authority that that person has over you. You don't have to spell it out. You don't have to think it out.

You just recognize a moral authority. And you know therefore that if that person who has, let's just say, a person who gave  you enough money to stay in school, that last semester, so you could graduate. So you were able to make it through college. If a person like that comes to you and asks for a cup of sugar and you say no, you probably  are in a sense being disobedient because you realize that a small request like that from  a person like that is is disobedient because that person has some kind of moral right over  you. So when we talk about obedience, we mean the person we owe some kind of authority to, some  kind of deference to.

In this case, we have an unparalleled claim. It doesn't just say that Jesus Christ wants you, wants you on Sunday or Jesus Christ just  wants your will. He wants you to obey the Ten Commandments. It says Jesus Christ is demanding the captivity of every thought. That means his authority and his moral authority over you is absolute.

Well, where does the Bible come off saying that? And it comes off this way and think about the logic of it and it's overwhelming logic,  I think. Were you created or are you an accident? There's really nothing in the middle, you know? Did someone or something with intelligence, rationality, something with a purpose create  you?

If not, you are an accident and you know we sometimes spend time on this, I won't spend  much time on this, but just think it out. Then we see a lump of lead that fell off of the, out of the sleuths in the factory which  is taking lead and turning it into this or that part. And if a piece falls off, molten lead and it falls to the floor and it just forms some  kind of arbitrarily formed puddle, and then it hardens, what do we call that? It's an accident. You don't look at that thing and say, what's it for?

Can you break it? By the way, if you pick it up and it sort of squished and all like this and then you break  it over your leg and it falls into two pieces, you don't say, oh, you broke it. You don't say that because it was already broke because it had no purpose. It wasn't useful. You might be able to use it as a door stop or something like that, but you see it wasn't  created for a purpose.

So it's an accident. So there's no way to violate it and there's no way to break it and has no purpose. For you, you, the result of the blind collision of forces. Are you an accident? Are you an accident of evolution?

Are you an accident of chemical reactions? Are you an accident? In that case, there is no purpose for you. There's no right or wrong for you. There's no intention for your life.

There's no meaning for your life. There's no way for you to be broken. You may feel I'm depressed. There's something wrong. If you aren't created, how are you to say what's wrong?

That's wrong. Whatever is is. Nobody likes to live with that, nobody likes to believe that, and also nobody really  does believe that because you sense that there is something about me that is of design. So most of us want to say I was created. I'm not an accident, but if you were created, what rights would your creator have over  you?

Think of it this way. What if you had poured tremendous amount of energy, creative energy, all of your  talents into a song? It's the best song you ever wrote, okay, you musicians. And before you have a chance to copyright it, somebody picks it up, sells it him or herself,  gets the credit for it, and makes a zillion dollars. How would you feel?

Now because you were so maybe dumb as to not get a copyrighted, there's no way that you  can really, legally, say, that's mine. You can't prove it. But the person did was perfectly legal. Yet you would feel I have moral rights, I have moral rights over that song. Why?

If it wasn't for me, it wouldn't exist. And the one using it couldn't have produced it. Now this is all intuitive. We all know this. There's nobody in this room who would not experience that the same way.

You see, if it wasn't for me, it wouldn't exist. And the one using it couldn't have produced it and therefore should, I have moral rights. I have more rights. Not saying I don't want anybody else to enjoy the song, I'm not saying I don't want anybody  else to use the song. But I should have the ultimate moral rights over that thing.

Or the same thing would happen if you invented a new fuel injection apparatus for an automobile  in your basement so that the car that uses it would get 300 miles to a gallon. Somebody else comes along and takes it. Starts using it. How would you feel? You have moral rights over that.

If it wasn't for me, it wouldn't exist. Now, what if, and plenty of you do, and plenty of us do, and all of us do, at a certain  point, before we get converted into Christianity, what if you decide, I alone have the right  to decide what to do with my body, what to do with my sexuality, what to do with my talent,  how to spend my money, how to use my time, I and I alone. Did you produce that talent? Whether you're an accident, or you've been created, in which case, that creator, if we could  find them, if we could communicate with them, if there's a creator, has ultimate moral rights  over you, and for you to be going off and taking the things, the things that have risen  out of resources that you did not generate, you couldn't have produced, and using them  for your own profit, without deference to him, without saying, what do you want me to do  with my money, what do you want me to do with my talent, what do you want me to do with my  brain, what do you want me to do with my sexuality, just as bad, or worse, because let me tell  you, the creative energy that goes into a song is great as that it is nothing like the  creative energy that goes into a human being. Every thought, every moment, every dimension of your life belongs to the one who created  it, without which, without whom, excuse me, without whom, none of this would exist, none  of you would exist, no part of you would exist, see?

Therefore, when the Bible says, every thought, every one of your thoughts belongs to Jesus,  it is assuming that this is the one who created you, and let me tell you one thing, there  really isn't much in between. You can either say, I'm an accident, and therefore I can do anything I want, but you have to live  with the consequences of the fact there's no right and wrong, if to live with the consequence  of the fact there is no meaning except that which you manufacture, if to live with all that,  or else you have to say, I owe my creator every single thought, every dimension, not just  Sunday's, not just a tip of the hat, everything, absolute, rightful king, and before we move  on, let me just appeal to you, I want you all to know that most of you are Americans, and  even those of you who aren't from America have maybe been here long enough to sort of  imbibe the American, Western, individualistic culture, and I want you to know and be aware  and be completely cognizant of how prejudiced you are against this whole idea. When you come to the Bible, and when you come to the Christian message, you have to realize  what a filter you have over your mind, and you're screening out an awful lot of the absolute  natures of the claims of Christ and the message of Christianity, because John Guest is an  Episcopalian pastor who has been in America for a long time, but he came here in his 20s  from Britain, he was an Anglican minister, and years ago I heard him give a talk, and  I don't know if he mentions this illustration anymore, maybe you heard it, if you know him  or heard him before, he, when he first came to this country he said he was struck, because  he went to a some historic site, and he was going into a place that was a revolutionary  war era tavern, that had been preserved the way it was in America during the Revolutionary War,  this must have been either filled out for your Boston I think, and he went in and he saw the tavern,  and he noticed it was a sign from the era, up, over the tables, and it said we serve no sovereigns  here, you know, kind of American in your face, we don't have kings here, we've got presidents,  they do what we want, if they don't do what most a 51% of us want, they're out of there,  we don't have kings, we serve no sovereigns here, and John Guest said he suddenly realized he  was in a different culture, he said you know, he says in Europe we're secular people, I said you  know we're not this wonderful, we're not wonderfully moral people, he says but I tell you at least  we still have some positive memories of bowing the need to a sovereign, we at least have some  positive vibrations about that, people from the East, Asians very often also come from a situation  in which at least the positive benefits of authority and submission are held up, but when you come  to America, you come to one place where that notion, the notion of a king is anathema, the notion  of a king is really repugnant, it's very much a part of who we are, it's very deep in us,  there is no higher authority than my individual conscience, and every single person who's been  in America for very long, that is so much a part of us that nobody, no Americans ever come to  these kinds of passages and this kind of teaching objective, you're not objective, you are not open  minded when it comes to these things, you hate the idea, we'll get into why I admit, but you have  to see that, but what do you do about it? What do you do about it is this, it's a great place, and I  can't quote it exactly, but it's really sunk into my memory, in a book, which is probably at the  book table or it ought to be, or we'll be soon, right David, because I'm mentioning it, so you'll  be run with it, a Becky Pippert wrote a book called Out of the Salt Shaker, which is really a book  on how to share what Christ has done for you with other people, there's this one wonderful section  in which she says, just remember, when people say they want to be free and they don't want to have  to submit to a king, just remind them that everybody's got a king, everybody's got a lord, and she says  something like this, she says, those who seek power, those who seek power, that's the thing you're  seeking, then you're serving power, power is mastering and ruling you, it's really what drives you,  if you want approval in life, then you will be mastered, you see, ruled by image, or what people  think of you, if you want money, then you will be ruled by money, if you say, ah listen, if you say,  I don't, I don't submit to anybody, I belong to myself, then you're ruled by independence,  you're the kind of person that has to do things, you have to do things, just to show that you don't  owe anybody anything, and if you have to show that you don't owe anybody anything, to show that  you owe nothing to anybody, that nothing rules you, you're ruled by your own independence,  or no matter what, something is your lord, something is your king, you don't belong to yourself,  so you have to realize the Christianity is not saying, you over here, you're free, you know,  you don't serve anything but yourself, come and be captive to Christ, no Christianity, the offer of  Christianity is this, you're a captive to something, your thoughts are captive to something, you know  they are, the things that you feel like you've got to have, your thoughts are captive, you do not  belong to yourself, and so the Christian message is, stop being ruled by things that tyrannize you and  start being ruled by the one king that won't tyrannize you because he is your rightful king,  he's the one that knows how you run, he's the one that knows who you are,  and therefore you don't go from freedom to slavery to become a Christian, you go from slavery to  freedom, because freedom is not a lack of a master, freedom is not the lack of a king but it's  finding a true king for everybody's got one, no one is his or her own, so secondly, first we saw  that this is implicit, Jesus is the king, every single part of you must be obedient to him,  that's the implicit, but then explicitly it tells us how he exercises this kingship in our lives,  and you know how he does it? This is very, very bold and also really neat, he is a conqueror,  that means the way Jesus Christ exercises his kingship in our lives is he sees us as having captured  a heart that belongs to himself, some other things are ruling in there, and therefore Paul says  what Jesus does as a king is he comes and besieges your heart, the way a king would besiege  his capital, that his now fallen under enemy hands, and this is something that Jesus does  and unless you understand that this is the way in which he works, this is how he exercises his  kingship, a lot of you are not going to be able to understand what's going on in your life right  now, right now you may be under siege, there may be divine weapons being shot at you,  see you may be finding that arguments and pretensions are being demolished by some kind of spiritual  weaponry, this is what Jesus does to the human heart, this is how he comes, he comes as a conquering  but let's see what the features of this, the features are, first this work is not a violent work  in a sense of being physically violent or it's not a coercive violence at all, instead the kind  of conquering that Jesus does is he seeks to win your heart and that literally means he seeks to  get you to fall in love with him, that's the conquest, you know we have some predilection to  talk this way when it comes to romance, you know we do talk a little bit about that, we talk like that  sometimes, some of the love poetry says you've conquered me, all right I you know I didn't know  who you were, I didn't really like you at first and yet I've been won by you, you see you've captured  my heart, we use that sometimes in sort of drippy hyperbolic ways you know when we talk about what's  happened to us when we fall in love but Jesus actually is using that terminology almost literally,  look first of all his conquering work is full of gentleness and meekness in the very first verse  Paul who's about to tell us that he is in Jesus army he's a preacher and he's a church planter  and he says I am coming after you but not with my weapons, with divine weapons, in other words  Paul is saying that with the way when he preaches the gospel when he persuades people to turn to  Christ he is actually in Christ's army and therefore he's participating in this kingly conquering  campaign that Jesus does when he besieges the human heart and that's what we see here but look  he starts off talking about this warfare and this conquest by saying by the meekness and gentleness  of Christ I appeal to you so we see that this conqueror is meek and gentle and he's after what  your thoughts he's after your motives in other words he is not trying to get you to be  coerced he's not trying to get you to be a begrudging slave he's not trying to force you to do  thump something that you don't want to he wants to capture your heart he wants to soften your heart  he wants your thoughts see to get your thoughts is to is to get you to see the delight that he is  to see the love that he is to see the freedom that he is and he does it with meekness and gentleness  look for example let me give you a great example of this Psalm 119 a very very long Psalm  I would take you week to read it usually it's it's not a typical Psalm it's got it's very very long  but there's a section of it in fact I could read you any section to show you an example of a conquered  heart but let me read you just a section out of out of it verse 97 and so on right around there  and the Psalmist says behold how I love your law I meditate on it all day long your commands make  me wiser than my enemies further ever with me I have more understanding than my elders for I obey  your precepts I have kept my feet from every evil path that I might obey your word how sweet  are your words to my taste sweeter than honey to my mouth I gain understanding from them therefore  I hate every wrong path now that is the language of a conquered heart that's not the language of  a person who was just raised moral you know people who are raised moral a lot of you were raised  in kind of conservative churches and raised not necessarily Christian churches conservative homes  and conservative backgrounds and when you have a quiet time when you sit down and study the bible  and pray you say I feel better I feel better but you don't feel close to God you just have some  relief in your conscience you're afraid you may know the story of the prodigal son  but it's not just about a wayward younger brother in fact Jesus tells this story to speak both to  those who run from God and to those who try to earn his love by being good in his book the  prodigal God Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart of the gospel a message of  hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental older brother and an invitation  for all to experience God's prodigal extravagant grace whether you're a Christian or you're still  exploring faith the prodigal God will help you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way  the prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the  hope and joy of Christ gracious and relentless love with people all over the world request your  copy today at gospel and life dot com slash give that's gospel and life dot com slash give now  here's doctor Keller with the rest of today's teaching I've had a lot of people tell me and I  know I'm I'm in danger of throwing out here a you know a subject that I'm not going to be able to  get back to and some preaching professor years ago said to me never you know raise more snakes than  you can kill when you're sermon if you raise a snake make sure you have time to kill it I don't  can't do this one but some of you know that one of the things that we say here at the Bible teaches  is that once you become a Christian now there is no condemnation for those who were in Christ Jesus  but once you truly are united to the Father through the Son there's no way that your sins can  bring you ever back into a state of condemnation you're in ah well people say I'm glad I don't  believe will you believe I don't believe that I say what I said well if if I knew  that no matter what I did once I became a Christian there would be no condemnation for me  what a temptation that would be I said well explain that to me how would that be a temptation  say well I wouldn't have any incentive to live a moral life and I would say okay let me get  this straight you're saying that if you would no longer be afraid of God no longer be afraid of his  wrath no longer be afraid of his punishment no longer be afraid of him coming and getting you that  you would lose all your incentive to live a moral life okay let me get this straight all your incentive  is fear all of your incentive is negative and a lot of people who think their Christians  have nothing but a negative morality they come to church because if they don't come to church  they're conscience bothers and that's fine for a start that's a fine way to get on the path  to real Christianity but that's all it is there's people who who are very careful in their business  life to be straight arrows and everybody around them says oh yeah she he yeah very much is straight  out very moral you know don't don't use that kind of language around her don't do this around him  you know don't get them in on a deal like that you know they're pretty straight arrows they wouldn't  like it and so forth and you know that you have that reputation feel pretty good about it it could  all be fear your heart your thoughts your motives never conquered the reason that your moral is  frickly because it's been inculcated in you since you were little you just you know it's very powerful  to be told as a little kid don't do that never do that God will get you if that happens to you  you know you don't lose that over the years and that's fine for a start it is fine for a start  but that's not Christianity Jesus is not after that he's after something far far more  deep than that the psalmist when you read Psalm 119 you'll see for example the psalmist does not see  the Bible he's talking about by law he doesn't see the Bible is strictly a set of nice  he doesn't see it as a book of virtues for example he doesn't see it as a set  of esophs fables with morals at the end of it he calls the word of God he calls the Bible  thy precepts thy commands you see I meditate on them I love them he knows that their words of the  king he knows he has to obey them but look what he says he says they give me insight they make me  great I there's one place where he says I pant after your commands what's going on here  his heart's been captured the big big difference between a Christian and a moral person Paul says  in 2 Corinthians 3 you know you're really a Christian when the law is written on your heart not  just on your conscience when you find in your in most self that the law got a sweet you know in  Psalm 1 it tells you the mark of a godly person it doesn't say godly person praise day and night  though hopefully he or she will doesn't say that the godly person witnesses on the street  corners day and night though of course I hope he will or she will I it doesn't say that that person  goes to church every time the doors are open though I hope you know he or she will attend church  regularly now you can do all that out of fear you know do all that without a heart that's been  captured by the king with your thoughts not captive just your will now what is saying someone it says  for he that's the godly man the lights in the law of God and upon it he meditates day and night  he doesn't just read it and say I got to do it I better do it I better get to know it he meditates  he chews on it he gets the sweetness out of it he loves to see it because he senses that the more  he takes it in the more he's becoming something great he says I have more insight than my elders I  love what this does for me think of it like this what if what if you were a gymnast what if you  were a gymnast let's say you're a young girl but you're now you know you've never quite hit your  peak you what at least you never hit what you think you should be able to do you haven't made it  and how you're starting to get a little old in for your career ever to really be good and you're  kind of frightened and somebody says let's let's take you to a really good coach I know of a good  coach and the coach comes and the coach really starts to rigorously give you a lot of hard exercise  and a lot of hard rules and all that but you begin to soar you begin to win and you begin to jump  higher than you ever have and you begin to your body begins to do things that you never could do  before you're flying because you're obeying and how would you look at the commands of your coach  they'd be sweeter than honey to you you'd pant after them you say more more because I see what  it's doing to me it's it's making me great has that happened to you ever see that's a very big part  of what what Jesus does when he conquers your heart he brings it captive now how does he do it  and the answer is good kings or I should say good generals if they're besieging a city don't just  say to their their armies charge you know when and wherever you want you know a fire will instead  a good king decides where they're going to attack on the wall and we have here two places that  we're told that Jesus attacks it says what it says verse five now don't forget Paul is talking  about we he's part of the army he's part of the thing but he's talking about Jesus campaign  and he says with these with these weapons of divine power we demolish arguments and every  pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God there's two things arguments and  pretensions I'll try to be brief on this because even though each of these would be it would be great  to go in the word arguments means just what it looks like rational arguments the word pretensions  literally means high things proud things that's why that's not a bad it's not a bad you know some of  these words are very hard to translate and the translators when they're sitting there trying to  figure out the best word I know they must agonize that's not bad pretension to pretend means  to try to to to be something that you're not and what this is telling us is there's two ways in  which the king comes after you to win your heart one is more intellectual and one is personal let's  just look at these two things for a minute the first thing is he comes after arguments a lot of  modern people don't want to hear this but let me just explain what that means the Bible tells us  that everybody has faith one of the things is so irritating for a thoughtful Christian when  talking to people who don't believe Christianity is they say well you know if you could prove God  to me I could believe but you can't and the implication is I'm a skeptical person you see I'm  skeptical and I only believe what can be proved and if you're the faith the kind of person has  faith fine you can't prove what you what you believe and if you could prove it to me then I  would be very happy to to believe it's irritating because the assumption is I as a Christian have faith  and it's sort of based on you know nothing and you don't have faith but that's not true the Bible  says at the bottom of every single human being are arguments at the bottom of everyone are arguments  you cannot make a move I gotta make sure I do this concisely and don't go off for 10 minutes  I don't have time for that but you cannot make a choice you could for example just give a quick  example let's just say all of your life you're taught don't have sex apart from marriage you know  you were taught that out in Missouri but then you moved to New York and you come to New York  and hear everybody thinks that only very odd strange people you know would adhere to that  and so you start to feel attracted to somebody who obviously wants to have sex with you and you  decide what you're gonna do it or not do you realize you can't make a decision about that unless  your decision assumes either that the universe is ultimate that there is a creator god that he has  spoken that he's got rules or that there's not if you decide to sleep with a girl or the guy  why well you know intellectually you might not want to work at all out you don't want to work it out  you don't want to think it out but what you've actually done is you've bought the argument that  well there may not be a god but if there is a god we can't know what he teaches right aren't you  assuming that there might be a god but if there is a god we can't know that he said anything about  sexuality that is a religious assumption that is that's an axiom and you're basing your life on it  you can't prove it anymore than I can prove it so you can't prove it's wrong anymore than I can  prove it's right but don't you see what that means you are basing your life and you were  practice on an axiom that is an axiom of faith and you are betting your destiny on it  so when somebody says to me you can't prove god I say you can't prove there isn't god  and even though this doesn't go too far but at least it gets after people at one certain level  you can't prove that there isn't god and yet you're betting your life that there isn't  I can't prove that there is a god and I'm betting my life that there is now we can talk once  you're willing to admit that we both have faith and there were both betting and wagering our lives  on our faith assumptions and we're both deeply religious because science can't tell you what there's  a god or whether there isn't science can't tell you all these things now what Paul is getting at  and what the Bible gets at and there's another other places where it talks about this is that there  are arguments there are rational belief structures there are all there's a matrix of these faith  assumptions underneath you and everybody no matter what you say about what where you stand with  Christianity you've got a belief system you've got a matrix of these things you've got arguments  that you're basing your life on the average non-Christian doesn't want to look at those things  you don't want to look at them my sister-in-law some years ago had an interesting experience where she  was at med school and and they were part she was part of an internship and they were doing the  rounds all the other students were talking about a particular patient they said you know be better  just to turn it all off and let the let the lady die because she's suffering and once she's dead she  won't suffer and sometimes suicide is better because at least when when you're dead you're not  suffering and my sister-in-law looked at them and said can you prove that how do you know that these  people aren't going to hell now she said I'm not trying to argue right now that there is a hell  but I'm trying to show you that your medical decision is assuming there's not well they say well  you know there's no proof well there's no proof that there's not there is no way that you can make  a move without all sorts of religious assumptions that's all I'm trying to say I'm not trying to prove  the Christianity's right I'm not even saying please don't anybody get the impression that I'm saying  that there's no way to show that one set of assumptions is better than another actually that's  the whole point Paul says Jesus Christ will always come and show you your faith assumptions and show  you that they're inferior that they don't explain reality like Christianity does that you can't  really live consistently with them but the point is that Jesus Christ will always in order to win your  heart make you think and I have people all the time coming to me and saying I've got problems in  my life and I just want to connect with God they don't want to think is the Bible true or not well  you know they like their argument that means they like their intellectual construct that allows  them to say who knows but that's a faith assumption they don't want to have to examine it why because  they want to be able to leave things out of the Bible they think that are primitive they don't like  to think that maybe Jesus is the only way to God they think that you know they've got a modern  construct that says all religions are ways to God how do they know that they don't know that it's  a set of arguments they haven't thought it out they haven't thought out if that's logical if it's  possible they don't want to think about that they want peace they want to connect with Jesus they want  to walk by a river side and see the beauty of the Grand Canyon and they just want God to be real to  them so they can handle their lives he never does that without demolishing arguments  he never does that without making you think you see Christianity is based on hard truth objective  truth propositional truth it's true or it's not true but to reject it takes a lot of thinking  as well as to accept it and to reject it takes a faith commitment as well as to accept it and people  aren't even willing to do that Jesus will not deal with you without making you think  all people get very upset about this they don't want to have to think  but he will always come in by demolishing arguments he'll show you there's a rational basis  for what the Bible teaches there's a reason for the hope Christianity is full of truth claims they'll  make you think there's no way to get his peace there's no way for him to capture your heart he'll  always make you think but then on the other hand there's pretensions and you see underneath all the  intellectual objections to the to the kingship of Christ our moral objections pretensions literally  means high things that ultimately Paul was saying that besides the arguments and in some ways the  strength of the arguments is our pride we don't we say we can't believe that's the arguments  because we don't want to obey and that's the pretension pretension means self will the other day  I had the experience of telling a 10 year old boy that his mother needed him he was in a bad  mood and he stood up and he looked at me and he said she always needs me and when I go to her she  asks me to do things that I hate he was furious he was just in a bad mood he was playing a video game  didn't want to go now see I was and I thought about this I said you know that's the way children are  all demands are unreasonable as far as a child's concern all demands are unreasonable I want to do  what I want to do I don't want anybody telling me what to do every time I go to see my mother she has  me to do things I don't feel like doing that's deep that's very deep and you don't think that when  you start to approach God it's gonna go off and therefore there is something in us very deeply  rooted that you have to admit I hope you see it that that keeps you from really being objective when  it comes to Christianity you say I cannot put myself in a place where I am not am out of control I  know what I want no one should have the right to tell me what to do and therefore when the king seeks  to conquer your heart on the one hand he has arguments and he comes after you and he makes you think  but on the other hand he's got to do something about your pride and therefore he puts out all kinds  of humbling conditions and humbling circumstances and things that bring you to the end of your own  resources this to me is a very very very practical verse it's telling me how almost everybody I know has  ever found Christ conquering their heart and getting them getting getting you to love him it's never  just humbling you without arguments or just arguing you without humbling it's always the two together  unless something happens to show you that you do not have what it takes you're not competent to  run your own life unless he does something about your high things you're just never going to come to  him but on the other hand if you think he's going to come to you and you're going to come to him  without thinking just having some kind of mystical experience it won't work either they both come  together they have to come together and now let me conclude this way first of all to those of you  who've really never given yourself to him just think about this you are in a position where you are  going to have to be willing to see that some of the humbling things that are happening to you  maybe because the king is trying to get you to love him he's dealing with your high things  instead of saying why is he doing this to me he's meek and gentle remember that's the first where  he's very meek and gentle but he will do what it takes it'll hurt him it says in lamentations three  he does not willingly afflict the sons of men oh notice what it says he doesn't like it  doesn't say he doesn't do it he says he doesn't willingly do it he doesn't like to do it he's  meek and gentle a bruised reedy will not break it says in Matthew 12 a smoking flaxi will not quench  till he brings forth judgment to victory but he'll do it and if you resist him don't tempt him  because he will do what it takes to bring down your high things because he loves you  or on the other hand you're going to have to start thinking you're going to have to start reading  you have to start studying you have to go to classes you're going to have to study the Bible you  have to talk to other people you're not going to ever get yourself to Christ through a misal  experience you have to decide can I accept the Christian faith can I accept the teachings of  the Christian faith they've got to happen that could be what needs to be done right now humble yourself  under his mighty hand and he will exalt you in due time you know a perfect perfect in fact I don't  know if he did it but John Dunn has his wonderful son at that he wrote and it's it's so much a great  summarizing of this passage that it's hard not to think that he had it in my didn't have it in my  when he wrote it you've heard it John Dunn batter my heart three person God for you as yet but  knock breeze shine and seek to mend but I may rise stand overthrow me and bend your force to  break blow burn and make me new hear that that I may rise and stand or throw me and bend your  force to break blow burn and make me new high things I like a usurp town to another do labor to  admit you but oh to no end reason your vice Roy and me me should defend but is captivated and  proves weak and untrue yet dearly I love you and would be loved feign but I'm betrothed unto  your enemy so divorce me on tire break that knot again take me to you imprison me for I accept you  and throw me never shall be free or ever chased except you ravish me yeah conquer me be willing to  let him bring down your high things be willing to think and Christian friends one more thing to you  guys listen you know you say well I've given myself to Christ he's my Lord and Savior but is  every thought captive it's really tough to admit this the cognitive therapies therapists are sort  of into it but they don't put Christian content and it's it goes like this are you depressed  are you anxious are you better look at what you're telling yourself that causes that emotion there's  always a thought down there you know you know here's here's a person who's the same thing happens to  Mrs.

A and Mrs. B and yet Mrs. A is okay Mrs. B gets depressed why it's not the circumstance that  makes Mrs. A and B depressed are okay it's what Mrs.

A and B is saying to themselves what they're  saying to themselves that makes them depressed you know it's something bad happens to Mrs. B and she  says yet just like my father said I'll never amount to hillabines she'll be depressed and if Mrs. A the  same thing happens Mrs. A but she says to herself as my my Lord Jesus is said to me  though your heart condemning God is greater than your heart in other words if you're depressed find  the thought at the bottom if you're angry find the thought at the bottom if you're anxious find  the thought at the bottom and get it captured by Jesus let him throw it out put his truth in there  that's your problem let him capture every thought  take me to you imprison me for I accept you and throw me never shall be free nor ever chased  unless you ravish me let's pray to the king let's pray our father we thank you that because you have  come to us the way you have seeking to overthrow in order to win seeking to defeat us in order to  lift us to victory help us to see what your your design is and help every person here to see what  your design is for him or her there's things going on in our lives right now that will only be  understood if we see ourselves through this text in 2nd Corinthians 10 we ask that you would make  it possible for us apply this by your Holy Spirit we pray in Jesus name amen you heard it  John done batter my heart three person God for you as yet but knock breeze shine and seek to mend  but I may rise stand over throw me and bend your force to break blow burn and make me new  hear that that I may rise and stand over throw me and bend your force to break blow burn and  make me new hi things I like a usurped town to another do labor to admit you but oh to no end  reason your vice Roy and me me should defend but is captivated and proves weak and untrue  yet dearly I love you and would be loved faint but I'm betrothed unto your enemy  so divorce me on tie or break that knot again take me to you imprison me for I accept you and throw me never  shall be free or ever chased except you ravish me yeah conquer me be willing to let him bring down  your high things be willing to think and Christian friends one more thing to you guys listen  you know you say well I've given myself to Christ I he's my lord and savior but is every thought captive  it's really tough to admit this the cognitive therapies therapists are sort of into it but they  don't put Christian content in it it goes like this are you depressed are you anxious are you  better look at what you're telling yourself that causes that emotion there's always a thought down  you know you know here's here's a person who's the same thing happens to Mrs. A and Mrs.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today's podcast where Tim Keller explores the person and promises of Jesus Christ.  2 Corinthians 10, 1-6. This is Paul speaking. By the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I appeal to you, I, Paul, who am timid when  face to face with you, but bold went away. I beg you that when I come I may not have to be as bold as I expect to be toward some  people who think that we live by the standards of this world. For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does.

The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world, on the contrary. They have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments in every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of  God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ. And we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience once your obedience is complete. And this is God's word.

We've been talking about Jesus as prophet, priest, and king. There's a place in Matthew 12 where Jesus says, the men of Nineveh will stand up in judgment  and condemn this generation. For they repented at the preaching of Jonah and behold a greater than Jonah is here. And the queen of the south will rise up on the judgment day and condemn this generation  for she came from the ends of the earth to Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon  is here. That's a very dramatic statement.

And you see what he's saying? He is saying, a greater than Jonah, I'm the ultimate prophet, a greater than Aaron or  Moses on the ultimate priest, a greater than Solomon on the ultimate king. That's quite a challenge, and that's quite a claim. But what we're going to look at here tonight is what does that mean? Now it shouldn't come of surprise to you that historically Christians and people who  have studied the Bible have seen that Jesus Christ executes his office.

That means he carries out his office of king in two different ways. He carries it out spiritually in the hearts of his people and he carries it out cosmically  in history. And we're not going to talk about the second ones tonight. We're going to talk about the first one. Because what we have here is an interesting description of how Jesus Christ approaches  the human heart.

What does it say? It says, though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does. The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world in the contrary. They have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments and every pretension it sets itself up against the knowledge of  God and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.

What is this describing? First of all, what is describing implicitly and then secondly, what is describing explicitly? Implicitly, tacitly, in other words, it's unstated but completely assumed and therefore  taught in the passage that Jesus Christ is king. And the reason we say Jesus Christ is king is because it says every thought has to be obedient  to Christ. Every thought.

My neighbor comes to me and asks me for a cup of sugar. And if I say no to my neighbor, I may be unkind, I may be rude, I may be uncompassionate,  I may be a bad neighbor but I'm not disobedient. You're only disobedient if you owe something to somebody, if that person has some rights  over you. And the fact that every thought, not just part but every thought of my life and my heart,  every dimension therefore of my being has to be made obedient to Christ means he's my absolute  monarch. So for example, I may have to be obedient to the police officer, why?

Well, it's part of what it means to be a citizen of the city. The police officer asked me to do something and I should obey because in a certain narrow  focus or scope, in a certain narrow scope, the police officer has rights over me. Now, it's all part of the social contract, it's all part of what it means when I decide  to live in a place like New York City and when I become a citizen of the United States  and when I elect representatives and they appoint this and they appoint that, the police officer  cannot tell me who to marry. At that point, the police officer is making a suggestion. The police officer says, I want you to marry my sister-in-law or I'm going to give you  a ticket.

You can't do that. He's got a scope. He says, you must do this when you get to that stop sign or I'm going to run you in. He has the right to do that. He has rights over me.

So there is a part of my life in which I have to obey the police officer and then of  course you can talk about all sorts of relationships we have in which we owe things to people. A person who's done a great deed for you, a good friend. And very often, if that person is sacrificed for you and you know that that person has done  something for you, you sense a certain moral authority that that person has over you. You don't have to spell it out. You don't have to think it out.

You just recognize a moral authority. And you know therefore that if that person who has, let's just say, a person who gave  you enough money to stay in school, that last semester, so you could graduate. So you were able to make it through college. If a person like that comes to you and asks for a cup of sugar and you say no, you probably  are in a sense being disobedient because you realize that a small request like that from  a person like that is is disobedient because that person has some kind of moral right over  you. So when we talk about obedience, we mean the person we owe some kind of authority to, some  kind of deference to.

In this case, we have an unparalleled claim. It doesn't just say that Jesus Christ wants you, wants you on Sunday or Jesus Christ just  wants your will. He wants you to obey the Ten Commandments. It says Jesus Christ is demanding the captivity of every thought. That means his authority and his moral authority over you is absolute.

Well, where does the Bible come off saying that? And it comes off this way and think about the logic of it and it's overwhelming logic,  I think. Were you created or are you an accident? There's really nothing in the middle, you know? Did someone or something with intelligence, rationality, something with a purpose create  you?

If not, you are an accident and you know we sometimes spend time on this, I won't spend  much time on this, but just think it out. Then we see a lump of lead that fell off of the, out of the sleuths in the factory which  is taking lead and turning it into this or that part. And if a piece falls off, molten lead and it falls to the floor and it just forms some  kind of arbitrarily formed puddle, and then it hardens, what do we call that? It's an accident. You don't look at that thing and say, what's it for?

Can you break it? By the way, if you pick it up and it sort of squished and all like this and then you break  it over your leg and it falls into two pieces, you don't say, oh, you broke it. You don't say that because it was already broke because it had no purpose. It wasn't useful. You might be able to use it as a door stop or something like that, but you see it wasn't  created for a purpose.

So it's an accident. So there's no way to violate it and there's no way to break it and has no purpose. For you, you, the result of the blind collision of forces. Are you an accident? Are you an accident of evolution?

Are you an accident of chemical reactions? Are you an accident? In that case, there is no purpose for you. There's no right or wrong for you. There's no intention for your life.

There's no meaning for your life. There's no way for you to be broken. You may feel I'm depressed. There's something wrong. If you aren't created, how are you to say what's wrong?

That's wrong. Whatever is is. Nobody likes to live with that, nobody likes to believe that, and also nobody really  does believe that because you sense that there is something about me that is of design. So most of us want to say I was created. I'm not an accident, but if you were created, what rights would your creator have over  you?

Think of it this way. What if you had poured tremendous amount of energy, creative energy, all of your  talents into a song? It's the best song you ever wrote, okay, you musicians. And before you have a chance to copyright it, somebody picks it up, sells it him or herself,  gets the credit for it, and makes a zillion dollars. How would you feel?

Now because you were so maybe dumb as to not get a copyrighted, there's no way that you  can really, legally, say, that's mine. You can't prove it. But the person did was perfectly legal. Yet you would feel I have moral rights, I have moral rights over that song. Why?

If it wasn't for me, it wouldn't exist. And the one using it couldn't have produced it. Now this is all intuitive. We all know this. There's nobody in this room who would not experience that the same way.

You see, if it wasn't for me, it wouldn't exist. And the one using it couldn't have produced it and therefore should, I have moral rights. I have more rights. Not saying I don't want anybody else to enjoy the song, I'm not saying I don't want anybody  else to use the song. But I should have the ultimate moral rights over that thing.

Or the same thing would happen if you invented a new fuel injection apparatus for an automobile  in your basement so that the car that uses it would get 300 miles to a gallon. Somebody else comes along and takes it. Starts using it. How would you feel? You have moral rights over that.

If it wasn't for me, it wouldn't exist. Now, what if, and plenty of you do, and plenty of us do, and all of us do, at a certain  point, before we get converted into Christianity, what if you decide, I alone have the right  to decide what to do with my body, what to do with my sexuality, what to do with my talent,  how to spend my money, how to use my time, I and I alone. Did you produce that talent? Whether you're an accident, or you've been created, in which case, that creator, if we could  find them, if we could communicate with them, if there's a creator, has ultimate moral rights  over you, and for you to be going off and taking the things, the things that have risen  out of resources that you did not generate, you couldn't have produced, and using them  for your own profit, without deference to him, without saying, what do you want me to do  with my money, what do you want me to do with my talent, what do you want me to do with my  brain, what do you want me to do with my sexuality, just as bad, or worse, because let me tell  you, the creative energy that goes into a song is great as that it is nothing like the  creative energy that goes into a human being. Every thought, every moment, every dimension of your life belongs to the one who created  it, without which, without whom, excuse me, without whom, none of this would exist, none  of you would exist, no part of you would exist, see?

Therefore, when the Bible says, every thought, every one of your thoughts belongs to Jesus,  it is assuming that this is the one who created you, and let me tell you one thing, there  really isn't much in between. You can either say, I'm an accident, and therefore I can do anything I want, but you have to live  with the consequences of the fact there's no right and wrong, if to live with the consequence  of the fact there is no meaning except that which you manufacture, if to live with all that,  or else you have to say, I owe my creator every single thought, every dimension, not just  Sunday's, not just a tip of the hat, everything, absolute, rightful king, and before we move  on, let me just appeal to you, I want you all to know that most of you are Americans, and  even those of you who aren't from America have maybe been here long enough to sort of  imbibe the American, Western, individualistic culture, and I want you to know and be aware  and be completely cognizant of how prejudiced you are against this whole idea. When you come to the Bible, and when you come to the Christian message, you have to realize  what a filter you have over your mind, and you're screening out an awful lot of the absolute  natures of the claims of Christ and the message of Christianity, because John Guest is an  Episcopalian pastor who has been in America for a long time, but he came here in his 20s  from Britain, he was an Anglican minister, and years ago I heard him give a talk, and  I don't know if he mentions this illustration anymore, maybe you heard it, if you know him  or heard him before, he, when he first came to this country he said he was struck, because  he went to a some historic site, and he was going into a place that was a revolutionary  war era tavern, that had been preserved the way it was in America during the Revolutionary War,  this must have been either filled out for your Boston I think, and he went in and he saw the tavern,  and he noticed it was a sign from the era, up, over the tables, and it said we serve no sovereigns  here, you know, kind of American in your face, we don't have kings here, we've got presidents,  they do what we want, if they don't do what most a 51% of us want, they're out of there,  we don't have kings, we serve no sovereigns here, and John Guest said he suddenly realized he  was in a different culture, he said you know, he says in Europe we're secular people, I said you  know we're not this wonderful, we're not wonderfully moral people, he says but I tell you at least  we still have some positive memories of bowing the need to a sovereign, we at least have some  positive vibrations about that, people from the East, Asians very often also come from a situation  in which at least the positive benefits of authority and submission are held up, but when you come  to America, you come to one place where that notion, the notion of a king is anathema, the notion  of a king is really repugnant, it's very much a part of who we are, it's very deep in us,  there is no higher authority than my individual conscience, and every single person who's been  in America for very long, that is so much a part of us that nobody, no Americans ever come to  these kinds of passages and this kind of teaching objective, you're not objective, you are not open  minded when it comes to these things, you hate the idea, we'll get into why I admit, but you have  to see that, but what do you do about it? What do you do about it is this, it's a great place, and I  can't quote it exactly, but it's really sunk into my memory, in a book, which is probably at the  book table or it ought to be, or we'll be soon, right David, because I'm mentioning it, so you'll  be run with it, a Becky Pippert wrote a book called Out of the Salt Shaker, which is really a book  on how to share what Christ has done for you with other people, there's this one wonderful section  in which she says, just remember, when people say they want to be free and they don't want to have  to submit to a king, just remind them that everybody's got a king, everybody's got a lord, and she says  something like this, she says, those who seek power, those who seek power, that's the thing you're  seeking, then you're serving power, power is mastering and ruling you, it's really what drives you,  if you want approval in life, then you will be mastered, you see, ruled by image, or what people  think of you, if you want money, then you will be ruled by money, if you say, ah listen, if you say,  I don't, I don't submit to anybody, I belong to myself, then you're ruled by independence,  you're the kind of person that has to do things, you have to do things, just to show that you don't  owe anybody anything, and if you have to show that you don't owe anybody anything, to show that  you owe nothing to anybody, that nothing rules you, you're ruled by your own independence,  or no matter what, something is your lord, something is your king, you don't belong to yourself,  so you have to realize the Christianity is not saying, you over here, you're free, you know,  you don't serve anything but yourself, come and be captive to Christ, no Christianity, the offer of  Christianity is this, you're a captive to something, your thoughts are captive to something, you know  they are, the things that you feel like you've got to have, your thoughts are captive, you do not  belong to yourself, and so the Christian message is, stop being ruled by things that tyrannize you and  start being ruled by the one king that won't tyrannize you because he is your rightful king,  he's the one that knows how you run, he's the one that knows who you are,  and therefore you don't go from freedom to slavery to become a Christian, you go from slavery to  freedom, because freedom is not a lack of a master, freedom is not the lack of a king but it's  finding a true king for everybody's got one, no one is his or her own, so secondly, first we saw  that this is implicit, Jesus is the king, every single part of you must be obedient to him,  that's the implicit, but then explicitly it tells us how he exercises this kingship in our lives,  and you know how he does it? This is very, very bold and also really neat, he is a conqueror,  that means the way Jesus Christ exercises his kingship in our lives is he sees us as having captured  a heart that belongs to himself, some other things are ruling in there, and therefore Paul says  what Jesus does as a king is he comes and besieges your heart, the way a king would besiege  his capital, that his now fallen under enemy hands, and this is something that Jesus does  and unless you understand that this is the way in which he works, this is how he exercises his  kingship, a lot of you are not going to be able to understand what's going on in your life right  now, right now you may be under siege, there may be divine weapons being shot at you,  see you may be finding that arguments and pretensions are being demolished by some kind of spiritual  weaponry, this is what Jesus does to the human heart, this is how he comes, he comes as a conquering  but let's see what the features of this, the features are, first this work is not a violent work  in a sense of being physically violent or it's not a coercive violence at all, instead the kind  of conquering that Jesus does is he seeks to win your heart and that literally means he seeks to  get you to fall in love with him, that's the conquest, you know we have some predilection to  talk this way when it comes to romance, you know we do talk a little bit about that, we talk like that  sometimes, some of the love poetry says you've conquered me, all right I you know I didn't know  who you were, I didn't really like you at first and yet I've been won by you, you see you've captured  my heart, we use that sometimes in sort of drippy hyperbolic ways you know when we talk about what's  happened to us when we fall in love but Jesus actually is using that terminology almost literally,  look first of all his conquering work is full of gentleness and meekness in the very first verse  Paul who's about to tell us that he is in Jesus army he's a preacher and he's a church planter  and he says I am coming after you but not with my weapons, with divine weapons, in other words  Paul is saying that with the way when he preaches the gospel when he persuades people to turn to  Christ he is actually in Christ's army and therefore he's participating in this kingly conquering  campaign that Jesus does when he besieges the human heart and that's what we see here but look  he starts off talking about this warfare and this conquest by saying by the meekness and gentleness  of Christ I appeal to you so we see that this conqueror is meek and gentle and he's after what  your thoughts he's after your motives in other words he is not trying to get you to be  coerced he's not trying to get you to be a begrudging slave he's not trying to force you to do  thump something that you don't want to he wants to capture your heart he wants to soften your heart  he wants your thoughts see to get your thoughts is to is to get you to see the delight that he is  to see the love that he is to see the freedom that he is and he does it with meekness and gentleness  look for example let me give you a great example of this Psalm 119 a very very long Psalm  I would take you week to read it usually it's it's not a typical Psalm it's got it's very very long  but there's a section of it in fact I could read you any section to show you an example of a conquered  heart but let me read you just a section out of out of it verse 97 and so on right around there  and the Psalmist says behold how I love your law I meditate on it all day long your commands make  me wiser than my enemies further ever with me I have more understanding than my elders for I obey  your precepts I have kept my feet from every evil path that I might obey your word how sweet  are your words to my taste sweeter than honey to my mouth I gain understanding from them therefore  I hate every wrong path now that is the language of a conquered heart that's not the language of  a person who was just raised moral you know people who are raised moral a lot of you were raised  in kind of conservative churches and raised not necessarily Christian churches conservative homes  and conservative backgrounds and when you have a quiet time when you sit down and study the bible  and pray you say I feel better I feel better but you don't feel close to God you just have some  relief in your conscience you're afraid you may know the story of the prodigal son  but it's not just about a wayward younger brother in fact Jesus tells this story to speak both to  those who run from God and to those who try to earn his love by being good in his book the  prodigal God Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart of the gospel a message of  hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental older brother and an invitation  for all to experience God's prodigal extravagant grace whether you're a Christian or you're still  exploring faith the prodigal God will help you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way  the prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the  hope and joy of Christ gracious and relentless love with people all over the world request your  copy today at gospel and life dot com slash give that's gospel and life dot com slash give now  here's doctor Keller with the rest of today's teaching I've had a lot of people tell me and I  know I'm I'm in danger of throwing out here a you know a subject that I'm not going to be able to  get back to and some preaching professor years ago said to me never you know raise more snakes than  you can kill when you're sermon if you raise a snake make sure you have time to kill it I don't  can't do this one but some of you know that one of the things that we say here at the Bible teaches  is that once you become a Christian now there is no condemnation for those who were in Christ Jesus  but once you truly are united to the Father through the Son there's no way that your sins can  bring you ever back into a state of condemnation you're in ah well people say I'm glad I don't  believe will you believe I don't believe that I say what I said well if if I knew  that no matter what I did once I became a Christian there would be no condemnation for me  what a temptation that would be I said well explain that to me how would that be a temptation  say well I wouldn't have any incentive to live a moral life and I would say okay let me get  this straight you're saying that if you would no longer be afraid of God no longer be afraid of his  wrath no longer be afraid of his punishment no longer be afraid of him coming and getting you that  you would lose all your incentive to live a moral life okay let me get this straight all your incentive  is fear all of your incentive is negative and a lot of people who think their Christians  have nothing but a negative morality they come to church because if they don't come to church  they're conscience bothers and that's fine for a start that's a fine way to get on the path  to real Christianity but that's all it is there's people who who are very careful in their business  life to be straight arrows and everybody around them says oh yeah she he yeah very much is straight  out very moral you know don't don't use that kind of language around her don't do this around him  you know don't get them in on a deal like that you know they're pretty straight arrows they wouldn't  like it and so forth and you know that you have that reputation feel pretty good about it it could  all be fear your heart your thoughts your motives never conquered the reason that your moral is  frickly because it's been inculcated in you since you were little you just you know it's very powerful  to be told as a little kid don't do that never do that God will get you if that happens to you  you know you don't lose that over the years and that's fine for a start it is fine for a start  but that's not Christianity Jesus is not after that he's after something far far more  deep than that the psalmist when you read Psalm 119 you'll see for example the psalmist does not see  the Bible he's talking about by law he doesn't see the Bible is strictly a set of nice  he doesn't see it as a book of virtues for example he doesn't see it as a set  of esophs fables with morals at the end of it he calls the word of God he calls the Bible  thy precepts thy commands you see I meditate on them I love them he knows that their words of the  king he knows he has to obey them but look what he says he says they give me insight they make me  great I there's one place where he says I pant after your commands what's going on here  his heart's been captured the big big difference between a Christian and a moral person Paul says  in 2 Corinthians 3 you know you're really a Christian when the law is written on your heart not  just on your conscience when you find in your in most self that the law got a sweet you know in  Psalm 1 it tells you the mark of a godly person it doesn't say godly person praise day and night  though hopefully he or she will doesn't say that the godly person witnesses on the street  corners day and night though of course I hope he will or she will I it doesn't say that that person  goes to church every time the doors are open though I hope you know he or she will attend church  regularly now you can do all that out of fear you know do all that without a heart that's been  captured by the king with your thoughts not captive just your will now what is saying someone it says  for he that's the godly man the lights in the law of God and upon it he meditates day and night  he doesn't just read it and say I got to do it I better do it I better get to know it he meditates  he chews on it he gets the sweetness out of it he loves to see it because he senses that the more  he takes it in the more he's becoming something great he says I have more insight than my elders I  love what this does for me think of it like this what if what if you were a gymnast what if you  were a gymnast let's say you're a young girl but you're now you know you've never quite hit your  peak you what at least you never hit what you think you should be able to do you haven't made it  and how you're starting to get a little old in for your career ever to really be good and you're  kind of frightened and somebody says let's let's take you to a really good coach I know of a good  coach and the coach comes and the coach really starts to rigorously give you a lot of hard exercise  and a lot of hard rules and all that but you begin to soar you begin to win and you begin to jump  higher than you ever have and you begin to your body begins to do things that you never could do  before you're flying because you're obeying and how would you look at the commands of your coach  they'd be sweeter than honey to you you'd pant after them you say more more because I see what  it's doing to me it's it's making me great has that happened to you ever see that's a very big part  of what what Jesus does when he conquers your heart he brings it captive now how does he do it  and the answer is good kings or I should say good generals if they're besieging a city don't just  say to their their armies charge you know when and wherever you want you know a fire will instead  a good king decides where they're going to attack on the wall and we have here two places that  we're told that Jesus attacks it says what it says verse five now don't forget Paul is talking  about we he's part of the army he's part of the thing but he's talking about Jesus campaign  and he says with these with these weapons of divine power we demolish arguments and every  pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God there's two things arguments and  pretensions I'll try to be brief on this because even though each of these would be it would be great  to go in the word arguments means just what it looks like rational arguments the word pretensions  literally means high things proud things that's why that's not a bad it's not a bad you know some of  these words are very hard to translate and the translators when they're sitting there trying to  figure out the best word I know they must agonize that's not bad pretension to pretend means  to try to to to be something that you're not and what this is telling us is there's two ways in  which the king comes after you to win your heart one is more intellectual and one is personal let's  just look at these two things for a minute the first thing is he comes after arguments a lot of  modern people don't want to hear this but let me just explain what that means the Bible tells us  that everybody has faith one of the things is so irritating for a thoughtful Christian when  talking to people who don't believe Christianity is they say well you know if you could prove God  to me I could believe but you can't and the implication is I'm a skeptical person you see I'm  skeptical and I only believe what can be proved and if you're the faith the kind of person has  faith fine you can't prove what you what you believe and if you could prove it to me then I  would be very happy to to believe it's irritating because the assumption is I as a Christian have faith  and it's sort of based on you know nothing and you don't have faith but that's not true the Bible  says at the bottom of every single human being are arguments at the bottom of everyone are arguments  you cannot make a move I gotta make sure I do this concisely and don't go off for 10 minutes  I don't have time for that but you cannot make a choice you could for example just give a quick  example let's just say all of your life you're taught don't have sex apart from marriage you know  you were taught that out in Missouri but then you moved to New York and you come to New York  and hear everybody thinks that only very odd strange people you know would adhere to that  and so you start to feel attracted to somebody who obviously wants to have sex with you and you  decide what you're gonna do it or not do you realize you can't make a decision about that unless  your decision assumes either that the universe is ultimate that there is a creator god that he has  spoken that he's got rules or that there's not if you decide to sleep with a girl or the guy  why well you know intellectually you might not want to work at all out you don't want to work it out  you don't want to think it out but what you've actually done is you've bought the argument that  well there may not be a god but if there is a god we can't know what he teaches right aren't you  assuming that there might be a god but if there is a god we can't know that he said anything about  sexuality that is a religious assumption that is that's an axiom and you're basing your life on it  you can't prove it anymore than I can prove it so you can't prove it's wrong anymore than I can  prove it's right but don't you see what that means you are basing your life and you were  practice on an axiom that is an axiom of faith and you are betting your destiny on it  so when somebody says to me you can't prove god I say you can't prove there isn't god  and even though this doesn't go too far but at least it gets after people at one certain level  you can't prove that there isn't god and yet you're betting your life that there isn't  I can't prove that there is a god and I'm betting my life that there is now we can talk once  you're willing to admit that we both have faith and there were both betting and wagering our lives  on our faith assumptions and we're both deeply religious because science can't tell you what there's  a god or whether there isn't science can't tell you all these things now what Paul is getting at  and what the Bible gets at and there's another other places where it talks about this is that there  are arguments there are rational belief structures there are all there's a matrix of these faith  assumptions underneath you and everybody no matter what you say about what where you stand with  Christianity you've got a belief system you've got a matrix of these things you've got arguments  that you're basing your life on the average non-Christian doesn't want to look at those things  you don't want to look at them my sister-in-law some years ago had an interesting experience where she  was at med school and and they were part she was part of an internship and they were doing the  rounds all the other students were talking about a particular patient they said you know be better  just to turn it all off and let the let the lady die because she's suffering and once she's dead she  won't suffer and sometimes suicide is better because at least when when you're dead you're not  suffering and my sister-in-law looked at them and said can you prove that how do you know that these  people aren't going to hell now she said I'm not trying to argue right now that there is a hell  but I'm trying to show you that your medical decision is assuming there's not well they say well  you know there's no proof well there's no proof that there's not there is no way that you can make  a move without all sorts of religious assumptions that's all I'm trying to say I'm not trying to prove  the Christianity's right I'm not even saying please don't anybody get the impression that I'm saying  that there's no way to show that one set of assumptions is better than another actually that's  the whole point Paul says Jesus Christ will always come and show you your faith assumptions and show  you that they're inferior that they don't explain reality like Christianity does that you can't  really live consistently with them but the point is that Jesus Christ will always in order to win your  heart make you think and I have people all the time coming to me and saying I've got problems in  my life and I just want to connect with God they don't want to think is the Bible true or not well  you know they like their argument that means they like their intellectual construct that allows  them to say who knows but that's a faith assumption they don't want to have to examine it why because  they want to be able to leave things out of the Bible they think that are primitive they don't like  to think that maybe Jesus is the only way to God they think that you know they've got a modern  construct that says all religions are ways to God how do they know that they don't know that it's  a set of arguments they haven't thought it out they haven't thought out if that's logical if it's  possible they don't want to think about that they want peace they want to connect with Jesus they want  to walk by a river side and see the beauty of the Grand Canyon and they just want God to be real to  them so they can handle their lives he never does that without demolishing arguments  he never does that without making you think you see Christianity is based on hard truth objective  truth propositional truth it's true or it's not true but to reject it takes a lot of thinking  as well as to accept it and to reject it takes a faith commitment as well as to accept it and people  aren't even willing to do that Jesus will not deal with you without making you think  all people get very upset about this they don't want to have to think  but he will always come in by demolishing arguments he'll show you there's a rational basis  for what the Bible teaches there's a reason for the hope Christianity is full of truth claims they'll  make you think there's no way to get his peace there's no way for him to capture your heart he'll  always make you think but then on the other hand there's pretensions and you see underneath all the  intellectual objections to the to the kingship of Christ our moral objections pretensions literally  means high things that ultimately Paul was saying that besides the arguments and in some ways the  strength of the arguments is our pride we don't we say we can't believe that's the arguments  because we don't want to obey and that's the pretension pretension means self will the other day  I had the experience of telling a 10 year old boy that his mother needed him he was in a bad  mood and he stood up and he looked at me and he said she always needs me and when I go to her she  asks me to do things that I hate he was furious he was just in a bad mood he was playing a video game  didn't want to go now see I was and I thought about this I said you know that's the way children are  all demands are unreasonable as far as a child's concern all demands are unreasonable I want to do  what I want to do I don't want anybody telling me what to do every time I go to see my mother she has  me to do things I don't feel like doing that's deep that's very deep and you don't think that when  you start to approach God it's gonna go off and therefore there is something in us very deeply  rooted that you have to admit I hope you see it that that keeps you from really being objective when  it comes to Christianity you say I cannot put myself in a place where I am not am out of control I  know what I want no one should have the right to tell me what to do and therefore when the king seeks  to conquer your heart on the one hand he has arguments and he comes after you and he makes you think  but on the other hand he's got to do something about your pride and therefore he puts out all kinds  of humbling conditions and humbling circumstances and things that bring you to the end of your own  resources this to me is a very very very practical verse it's telling me how almost everybody I know has  ever found Christ conquering their heart and getting them getting getting you to love him it's never  just humbling you without arguments or just arguing you without humbling it's always the two together  unless something happens to show you that you do not have what it takes you're not competent to  run your own life unless he does something about your high things you're just never going to come to  him but on the other hand if you think he's going to come to you and you're going to come to him  without thinking just having some kind of mystical experience it won't work either they both come  together they have to come together and now let me conclude this way first of all to those of you  who've really never given yourself to him just think about this you are in a position where you are  going to have to be willing to see that some of the humbling things that are happening to you  maybe because the king is trying to get you to love him he's dealing with your high things  instead of saying why is he doing this to me he's meek and gentle remember that's the first where  he's very meek and gentle but he will do what it takes it'll hurt him it says in lamentations three  he does not willingly afflict the sons of men oh notice what it says he doesn't like it  doesn't say he doesn't do it he says he doesn't willingly do it he doesn't like to do it he's  meek and gentle a bruised reedy will not break it says in Matthew 12 a smoking flaxi will not quench  till he brings forth judgment to victory but he'll do it and if you resist him don't tempt him  because he will do what it takes to bring down your high things because he loves you  or on the other hand you're going to have to start thinking you're going to have to start reading  you have to start studying you have to go to classes you're going to have to study the Bible you  have to talk to other people you're not going to ever get yourself to Christ through a misal  experience you have to decide can I accept the Christian faith can I accept the teachings of  the Christian faith they've got to happen that could be what needs to be done right now humble yourself  under his mighty hand and he will exalt you in due time you know a perfect perfect in fact I don't  know if he did it but John Dunn has his wonderful son at that he wrote and it's it's so much a great  summarizing of this passage that it's hard not to think that he had it in my didn't have it in my  when he wrote it you've heard it John Dunn batter my heart three person God for you as yet but  knock breeze shine and seek to mend but I may rise stand overthrow me and bend your force to  break blow burn and make me new hear that that I may rise and stand or throw me and bend your  force to break blow burn and make me new high things I like a usurp town to another do labor to  admit you but oh to no end reason your vice Roy and me me should defend but is captivated and  proves weak and untrue yet dearly I love you and would be loved feign but I'm betrothed unto  your enemy so divorce me on tire break that knot again take me to you imprison me for I accept you  and throw me never shall be free or ever chased except you ravish me yeah conquer me be willing to  let him bring down your high things be willing to think and Christian friends one more thing to you  guys listen you know you say well I've given myself to Christ he's my Lord and Savior but is  every thought captive it's really tough to admit this the cognitive therapies therapists are sort  of into it but they don't put Christian content and it's it goes like this are you depressed  are you anxious are you better look at what you're telling yourself that causes that emotion there's  always a thought down there you know you know here's here's a person who's the same thing happens to  Mrs.

A and Mrs. B and yet Mrs. A is okay Mrs. B gets depressed why it's not the circumstance that  makes Mrs. A and B depressed are okay it's what Mrs.

A and B is saying to themselves what they're  saying to themselves that makes them depressed you know it's something bad happens to Mrs. B and she  says yet just like my father said I'll never amount to hillabines she'll be depressed and if Mrs. A the  same thing happens Mrs. A but she says to herself as my my Lord Jesus is said to me  though your heart condemning God is greater than your heart in other words if you're depressed find  the thought at the bottom if you're angry find the thought at the bottom if you're anxious find  the thought at the bottom and get it captured by Jesus let him throw it out put his truth in there  that's your problem let him capture every thought  take me to you imprison me for I accept you and throw me never shall be free nor ever chased  unless you ravish me let's pray to the king let's pray our father we thank you that because you have  come to us the way you have seeking to overthrow in order to win seeking to defeat us in order to  lift us to victory help us to see what your your design is and help every person here to see what  your design is for him or her there's things going on in our lives right now that will only be  understood if we see ourselves through this text in 2nd Corinthians 10 we ask that you would make  it possible for us apply this by your Holy Spirit we pray in Jesus name amen you heard it  John done batter my heart three person God for you as yet but knock breeze shine and seek to mend  but I may rise stand over throw me and bend your force to break blow burn and make me new  hear that that I may rise and stand over throw me and bend your force to break blow burn and  make me new hi things I like a usurped town to another do labor to admit you but oh to no end  reason your vice Roy and me me should defend but is captivated and proves weak and untrue  yet dearly I love you and would be loved faint but I'm betrothed unto your enemy  so divorce me on tie or break that knot again take me to you imprison me for I accept you and throw me never  shall be free or ever chased except you ravish me yeah conquer me be willing to let him bring down  your high things be willing to think and Christian friends one more thing to you guys listen  you know you say well I've given myself to Christ I he's my lord and savior but is every thought captive  it's really tough to admit this the cognitive therapies therapists are sort of into it but they  don't put Christian content in it it goes like this are you depressed are you anxious are you  better look at what you're telling yourself that causes that emotion there's always a thought down  you know you know here's here's a person who's the same thing happens to Mrs. A and Mrs.

B and  yet Mrs. A is okay Mrs. B gets depressed why it's not the circumstance that makes Mrs. A and B  depressed or okay it's what Mrs. A and B is saying to themselves what they're saying to themselves  that makes them depressed you know if something bad happens to Mrs.

B and she says yet just like  my father said I'll never amount to a hill of beans she'll be depressed and if Mrs. A the same  thing happens Mrs. A but she says to herself as my my lord Jesus has said to me  though your heart can dem you God is greater than your heart in other words if you're depressed  find the thought at the bottom if you're angry find the thought at the bottom if you're anxious  find the thought at the bottom and get it captured by Jesus let him throw it out put his truth in  there that's your problem come capture every thought take me to you imprison me for I accept you  and throw me never shall be free nor ever chased unless you ravish me let's pray to the king let's  pray our father we thank you that because you have come to us the way you have seeking to  overthrow in order to win seeking to defeat us in order to lift us to victory help us to see  what your your design is and help every person here to see what your design is for him or her  there's things going on in our lives right now that will only be understood if we see  ourselves through this text in 2nd Corinthians 10 we ask that you would make it possible for us  apply this by your Holy Spirit we pray in Jesus name amen

今天的播客中，提姆·凯勒将带我们探讨耶稣基督的位格与应许。哥林多后书 10章1—6节。这是保罗在说话：“我——保罗——凭着基督的温柔和谦和劝你们：我在你们面前时好像谦卑，离开你们时却勇敢。我求你们：我来时不要不得不向某些人显出我以为必须有的那种勇敢；那些人以为我们是凭着属世的标准行事。因为我们虽然在世上行事，却不照着世人的方式打仗。

我们争战所用的兵器，不是属世的兵器；相反，它们有神的大能，能攻破坚固的营垒。我们攻破各样的辩驳和一切自高之事，就是那拦阻人认识神的，并且将各样的心思意念都夺回来，使它顺服基督。等到你们的顺服成全了，我们也预备好了要惩治一切不顺服的行为。”这是神的话。

我们一直在谈论耶稣作为先知、祭司和君王。在马太福音12章有一处，耶稣说：“尼尼微人要在审判的时候起来定这世代的罪，因为他们听了约拿所传的就悔改了；看哪，在这里有一位比约拿更大的。南方的女王也要在审判的日子起来定这世代的罪，因为她从地极而来，要听所罗门的智慧话；看哪，在这里有一位比所罗门更大的。”这是非常震撼的一句话。

你看他在说什么？他是在说：我比约拿更大——我是终极的先知；我比亚伦或摩西更大——我是终极的祭司；我比所罗门更大——我是终极的君王。这是极大的挑战，也是极大的宣称。但我们今晚要看的，是这到底意味着什么。你也不会觉得意外：从历史上看，基督徒以及研究圣经的人都认为，耶稣基督在两种不同的方式上执行他的职分——也就是他如何履行君王的职分：他一方面在他子民的心中属灵地掌权；另一方面在历史中、在宇宙性的层面上掌权。今晚我们不谈第二种，我们要谈第一种。因为这里对耶稣基督如何走近人心，有一个很有意思的描述。

经文怎么说？它说：“我们虽然在世上行事，却不照着世上的样式争战。我们争战的兵器本不是属血气的，乃是在神面前有能力，可以攻破坚固的营垒；将各样的计谋，各样拦阻人认识神的那些自高之事一概攻破，又将人所有的心意夺回，使它都顺服基督。”

这段话在描述什么？首先，它在“隐含地”描述什么？其次，它在“明确地”描述什么？隐含地、默会地——换句话说，这是没有明说却完全被假定、因此也在这段经文里被教导的——就是耶稣基督是王。我们之所以说耶稣基督是王，是因为这里说：每一个思想都必须顺服基督。每一个思想。

我的邻居来找我，要我给他一杯糖。如果我对邻居说“不”，我可能是不友善，我可能很粗鲁，我可能缺乏怜悯，我可能是个糟糕的邻居，但我并不是“不顺服”。只有当你欠某人什么、当那个人对你拥有某种权利的时候，你才谈得上是不顺服。而“每一个思想”——不只是部分，而是我生命和我内心的每一个思想——我存在的每一个维度都必须被带到对基督的顺服之下，这就意味着：他是我的绝对君王。

比如说，我可能需要顺服一位警察，为什么？因为这属于“成为这座城市公民”所包含的意义之一。警察让我做某件事，我应该服从，因为在某一个狭窄的焦点或范围之内，在某一个狭窄的权限范围之内，警察对我有权柄。现在，这都是社会契约的一部分，是我决定住在纽约这样一个地方、成为美国公民、选出代表，而他们任命这个、任命那个时所包含的一部分。警察不能告诉我该娶谁。到了那一步，警察只是在提建议。警察说：“我要你娶我的嫂子（或小姨子），不然我就给你开罚单。”

他不能那样做。他的权柄是有范围的。他可以说：“你到了那个停止标志必须这么做，不然我就把你带走。”他有权这么做。他对我有权柄。

在我生命中有一部分，我必须服从警察；当然，你也可以谈到我们与人之间各种各样的关系——在这些关系里，我们欠别人一些东西。比如一个为你做过大事的人、一个好朋友。很多时候，如果那个人曾为你付出、为你牺牲，而你知道那个人为你做过什么，你就会感到那个人对你有一种道德上的权威。你不需要把它讲得明明白白，也不需要把它想得很周全。

你只是会承认那种道德权威。你也因此知道：假如那个人——比如说，有个人在你最后一个学期给了你足够的钱，让你能继续上学、顺利毕业，使你能把大学读完——如果这样一个人来到你面前，跟你要一杯糖，而你说“不”，你大概在某种意义上就是在“违背”了，因为你意识到：像这样的一个人提出这样一个小请求，你拒绝它，就等于不顺服。因为那个人对你拥有某种道德上的“权利”。所以当我们谈“顺服”时，我们的意思是：我们欠某个人某种权威、某种尊重与让步。

而在这里，我们面对的是一个无与伦比的宣称。它不只是说耶稣基督要你——要你星期天来教会，或耶稣基督只是要你的意志、要你遵守十诫。它说：耶稣基督要求“每一个思想都被掳去”。这意味着，他对你的权柄、他对你的道德权威，是绝对的。

那么，《圣经》凭什么这样说？它之所以这样说，你想一想其中的逻辑，那是一种压倒性的逻辑，我认为。你是被创造的，还是一个意外？其实没有什么中间地带，你知道吗？是不是有某个具备智能、理性、带着目的的“某位”或“某物”创造了你？

如果不是，那你就是个意外——我们有时会花时间讲这一点，我不多讲，但你自己想一想就明白了：我们看到一团铅水从工厂的铅槽里掉出来——那工厂把铅加工成这个或那个零件。若有一滴熔化的铅掉到地上，摊成一滩随意的形状，然后凝固了，我们称它为什么？称它为“意外”。你不会看着那东西说：“它有什么用途？”

你能把它掰断吗？顺便说一句，如果你把它捡起来，它已经软塌塌、扭曲变形成这样，然后你把它往腿上一掰，它就断成两截，你不会说：“哦，是你把它弄断了。”你不会这么说，因为它本来就已经“坏了”，因为它没有用途。它不再有用处。你也许还能把它当门挡之类的东西用用，但你看，它并不是为着一个目的被造出来的。

所以这就是一个意外。所以也就谈不上“违背它”、也谈不上“把它弄坏”；它没有目的。对你来说——你不过是各种力量盲目碰撞的结果。你是个意外吗？你是进化的意外吗？

你是化学反应的意外吗？你是意外吗？如果是那样，你就没有任何目的。对你来说也就没有对错。你的生命也没有任何意图。

你的生命没有意义。你也就不可能被“弄坏”。你可能会觉得：“我很抑郁，好像哪里不对。”可如果你不是被创造的，你凭什么说“哪里不对”？

所谓“不对”也就不对了。事情怎样就是怎样。没有人喜欢这样活着，没有人喜欢相信这一套；而且其实也没有人真的这么相信，因为你心里知道：我这个人身上有某种“被设计”的东西。所以我们大多数人都想说：我是被造的。我不是意外。但如果你是被造的，你的创造主对你有什么权利呢？

这样想：假如你投入了巨大的精力、创造性的能量，把你所有的才华都倾注进一首歌里——这是你写过最好的歌，好吗，各位搞音乐的——可在你还来不及给它申请版权之前，有人把它拿走，当作自己写的去卖，名利都归他/她，还赚了个天文数字。你会有什么感受？

现在，因为你也许“傻乎乎的”没有去登记版权，你在法律上就很难说：“那是我的。”你也无法证明。但那个人做的又完全合法。可你仍然会觉得：我对那首歌有道德上的权利，我对那首歌有道德上的权利。为什么？

因为若不是我，它就不会存在；而使用它的人根本不可能自己把它创作出来。其实这一切都是直觉性的。我们都明白。这个房间里没有一个人不会以同样的方式去感受这件事。

你看，要不是因为我，它根本不会存在。而使用它的人也不可能创造出它，因此——我就应该拥有道德上的权利。我拥有更多的权利。我不是说我不希望别人也能欣赏这首歌，我也不是说我不希望别人使用这首歌。但我应该对那样东西拥有最终的道德权利。

同样的事也会发生在这样的情形里：如果你在自家地下室里发明了一种汽车的新型燃油喷射装置，使得装了它的车能达到一加仑跑三百英里。后来有人走过来把它拿走，开始使用它。你会有什么感受？你对它拥有道德上的权利。

如果没有我，它就不会存在。现在，假如——你们当中很多人这样做，我们当中很多人这样做，其实在某个阶段，我们所有人在还没有归信基督教之前都会这样做——假如你决定：只有我才有权决定如何使用我的身体，如何处理我的性，如何运用我的才干，怎样花我的钱，怎样使用我的时间；只有我，唯独我。那才干是你自己生产出来的吗？不论你是偶然的产物，还是你是被创造出来的——如果是后者，那么那位创造者（如果我们能找到他，如果我们能与他沟通；如果确实有一位创造者）对你就拥有最终的道德权利。而你却把那些东西——那些从你并未产生、你也不可能制造的资源中“生长”出来的东西——拿来为自己谋利，却不顾念他，不问他：“你要我怎样用我的钱？你要我怎样用我的才干？你要我怎样用我的头脑？你要我怎样处理我的性？”这同样糟糕，甚至更糟。因为我告诉你，投入一首歌的创造能量已经很伟大了，但它完全无法与创造一个人的创造能量相比。你生命中的每一个思想、每一个瞬间、每一个维度，都属于那位创造了它的主；没有他——更正一下——没有他，所有这一切都不会存在，你们也不会存在，你们的任何一部分都不会存在，你明白吗？

因此，当圣经说，你的每一个念头、你所有的思想都属于耶稣时，它的前提是：这位就是创造你的那一位。我告诉你，中间其实没有多少灰色地带。你要么说：我是个偶然，因此我想做什么就做什么——但你必须承受其后果：既然没有对与错；既然除了你自己制造出来的意义之外就没有意义；既然一切都只能如此——要么你就必须说：我欠我的创造主每一个念头、每一个维度，不只是主日，不只是象征性地点头致意，而是一切——绝对的、正当的君王。在我们继续之前，我想恳求你们：我希望你们都知道，你们大多数是美国人，即便你们不是美国人，也可能在这里待得够久，已经多少吸收了那种美国式、西方式、个人主义的文化。我希望你们知道、意识到，并且完全清楚：你们对这种观念有多么强烈的偏见。当你来到圣经面前、来到基督教信息面前时，你必须意识到自己的头脑上罩着怎样的滤镜；你正在把基督的宣称和基督教信息里许多“绝对性”的内容筛掉。因为约翰·盖斯特（John Guest）是一位圣公会牧师，在美国待了很久；但他二十多岁从英国来到这里时，还是一位英国国教的牧师。多年前我听他讲过一次，他用了一个比喻——我不知道他现在还用不用；如果你认识他或以前听过他讲道也许听过——他说他刚到这个国家时很震撼：他去参观一个历史遗址，走进一处革命战争时期的酒馆，那地方被保存成美国独立战争时的样子，应该是在波士顿附近之类。他进去看见酒馆，注意到桌子上方挂着一块当年的牌子，上面写着：我们这里不侍奉君主（we serve no sovereigns here）。你知道，很“美国式”地当面宣告：我们这里没有国王，我们有总统；他们得按我们的意思做，如果他们不按我们中51%的人想要的做，他们就下台。我们没有国王，我们这里不侍奉君主。约翰·盖斯特说，他突然意识到自己身处一种不同的文化。他说，你知道，在欧洲我们是世俗的人——我们并不是什么特别高尚、特别有道德的人——但至少，我们对向君主屈膝仍然有一些正面的记忆；至少，我们对那件事还有一些正面的“振动”。来自东方的人——亚洲人——也常常来自一种情境：至少权威与顺服的正面益处还被肯定。但当你来到美国，你来到一个地方：那种观念——国王的观念——是令人憎恶的；国王的观念是令人反感的。那是我们身份的一部分，深深扎根在我们里面：没有任何权威高过我个人的良心。每一个在美国待久了的人，这都成了我们的一部分，以至于没有任何美国人来到这些经文、来到这种教导面前时是客观的——你并不客观。谈到这些事时，你并不开放、不算“心胸开阔”。你厌恶这个观念——我们会谈到原因，我承认——但你必须先看见这一点。那么你该怎么办？你该怎么办是这样：有一段很精彩的话——我不能逐字准确引用——但它已经深深印在我记忆里，出自一本书，可能在书摊上；如果没有也应该有，或者很快就会有，对吧大卫？因为我提到它，你就会去进货。贝姬·皮珀特（Becky Pippert）写了一本书叫《从盐罐里出来》（Out of the Salt Shaker），基本是在讲如何把基督为你做了什么分享给别人。书里有一段很精彩，她说：要记得，当人说他们想要自由、不想顺服一个君王时，就提醒他们：每个人都有一个君王，每个人都有一个主。她大概这样说：那些寻求权力的人——如果你所追求的是权力，那么你就是在侍奉权力；权力在掌控你、统治你，它真正驱动着你。如果你想要人生中的认可，那么你就会被形象、被别人怎么看你所辖制、所统治。如果你想要钱，那么你就会被钱统治。如果你说：啊，听着，我不顺服任何人，我属于我自己——那么你就被“独立”统治。你会成为那种必须做某些事的人——你必须去做一些事——只是为了证明你不欠任何人什么；而如果你必须证明你不欠任何人什么，证明你不欠任何人、证明没有任何东西统治你，那么你就是被你自己的独立所统治。无论如何，总有某样东西是你的主、某样东西是你的王。你并不属于你自己。所以你必须明白：基督教并不是在说，“你在那边是自由的，你除了自己什么都不侍奉；来吧，来作基督的俘虏。”不，基督教所提供的是：你已经是某样东西的俘虏，你的思想已经被某样东西俘虏——你知道的。那些你觉得自己非要拥有不可的东西，你的思想被它们俘虏。你并不属于你自己。因此基督教的信息是：停止被那些暴政式地压迫你的事物统治，开始被那位不会暴政统治你的君王统治，因为他是你正当的君王；他知道你如何运作，他知道你是谁。因此，当你成为基督徒时，你不是从自由走向奴役，而是从奴役走向自由；因为自由不是没有主人，自由不是没有君王，而是找到真正的君王。每个人都有一个君王；没有人是他或她自己的主。所以第二点：第一，我们看到这是隐含的——耶稣是王，你的每一个部分都必须顺服他——这是隐含的；但随后，经文明确告诉我们，他如何在我们生命中行使这王权。你知道他怎么做吗？这非常大胆，也非常妙：他是一位征服者。这意味着，耶稣基督在我们生命中行使王权的方式是：他看见我们像是一颗本属于他的心，却被俘获在别的势力之下；有别的东西在里面作王。因此保罗说，耶稣作为君王所做的，是来围攻你的心，就像君王围攻自己的首都——那城如今落在敌手中。这是耶稣所做的事；若你不明白他就是这样工作、这样行使王权，那么你们许多人就无法理解你们现在生命里正在发生什么。此刻你可能正在被围攻；可能有属天的武器正在向你射来。你可能发现，一些论辩和自高之事，正在被某种属灵的兵器拆毁。耶稣就是这样对待人的心；他就是这样来——他以征服者的姿态来。但让我们看看这征服的特征。首先，这工作不是暴力的——不是身体上的暴力，也绝不是强迫性的暴力。相反，耶稣所做的征服，是要赢得你的心；这字面意思就是：他要让你爱上他——那就是征服。我们在谈恋爱时多少也会这样说：爱情诗里会说“你征服了我”。我原本不认识你，起初也不太喜欢你，但我被你赢得了；你俘获了我的心。我们有时会用这种黏腻、夸张的说法来形容坠入爱河时发生在我们身上的事；但耶稣其实几乎是在按字面意义使用这个术语。首先，他的征服工作充满温柔与谦和。第一节里，保罗正要告诉我们：他在耶稣的军队里——他是传道人、是植堂者——他等于在说：我会来找你们，但不是靠我的兵器，而是靠属天的兵器。换句话说，保罗说：当他传福音、劝人归向基督时，他实际上是在基督的军队中，因此他参与了这位君王所进行的征服战役——当耶稣围攻人的心时，他就在其中。我们在这里看到的就是这个。但注意：他一开始谈论这场争战与征服时就说：“我凭着基督的温柔、谦和劝你们。”所以我们看见，这位征服者是温柔谦和的；他要得着的是你的思想、你的动机。换言之，他不是要把你逼得屈服；他不是要你做一个不情愿的奴隶；他不是要强迫你去做你不想做的事。他要俘获你的心，要软化你的心。他要得着你的思想——得着你的思想，就是让你看见他是何等可喜、何等可爱、何等自由；他以温柔与谦和来成就这一点。比如我给你一个很好的例子：诗篇119篇，一篇非常非常长的诗篇。你可能得花一周才能读完；它并不是典型的诗篇，特别长。但其中有一段——其实我可以读任何一段来给你看被征服的心的例子——我就读其中一段：大约97节及其后。诗人说：“我何等爱慕你的律法，终日不住地思想。你的命令常存在我心里，使我比仇敌有智慧。我比年老的更明白，因我守了你的训词。我禁止我脚走一切邪路，为要遵守你的话。你的言语在我上膛何等甘美，在我口中比蜜更甜。我借着你的训词得以明白，所以我恨恶一切的假道。”这就是被征服之心的语言；这不是一个只是被“教养得很道德”的人的语言。很多人是被教养得很道德的——你们中有不少人在某些保守的教会长大，或者至少在保守的家庭、保守的背景里长大，不一定是真正的基督徒。当你有“灵修时间”，当你坐下来读经祷告时，你会说“我感觉好些了，我感觉好些了”，但你并不觉得与神亲近；你只是良心上得到一点缓解。你可能知道浪子回头的故事，但它不只是关于一个放荡的小儿子。其实耶稣讲这个故事，是对两种人说的：一类是逃离上帝的人，一类是想靠做好来赢得上帝之爱的人。在《浪子之神》（The Prodigal God）这本书里，提姆·凯勒说明了这个众所周知的故事如何揭示福音的核心——这信息同时给悖逆的小儿子和论断人的大儿子带来盼望，并邀请所有人来经历上帝那“浪费的”、奢侈的恩典。不论你是基督徒，还是仍在探索信仰，《浪子之神》都会帮助你以全新的方式看见你与基督的关系。《浪子之神》——我们感谢你这个月的奉献，帮助Gospel in Life把基督那恩慈而不放弃的爱所带来的盼望与喜乐，分享给全世界的人。今天就到gospel and life dot com slash give索取你的书；也就是gospel and life dot com slash

字面意思是“高处”，最终保罗是在说：除了论辩之外——而且某种意义上，论辩之所以有力量，是因为我们的骄傲——我们说“我不能信”（那是论辩），其实是因为我们不想顺服（那是自高）。Pretension 在这里的意思是“己意”。前几天我经历了一件事：我告诉一个十岁男孩，他妈妈需要他。他心情很差，站起来看着我说：她总是需要我；每次我去找她，她就叫我做我讨厌的事。他气坏了，整个人处在坏情绪里，正在打电子游戏，不想去。你看，我当时想：这就是孩子。对孩子来说，一切要求都是不合理的；一切要求都不合理。我想做我想做的事，我不想有人告诉我该做什么；每次我去找妈妈，她就让我做我不想做的事。那很深——非常深。你以为当你开始接近上帝时，这东西会消失吗？因此我们里面有某种极深的根，必须承认——我希望你看见——它使你在面对基督教时永远不可能真正客观。你会说：我不能把自己放在一个不在掌控之中的位置。我知道我想要什么；没有人有权利告诉我该做什么。因此，当君王要征服你的心时，一方面他用论辩来追赶你，让你思考；另一方面他必须处理你的骄傲，于是他布置各种使人谦卑的条件、使人谦卑的处境，把你带到你自己资源的尽头。对我来说，这节经文非常非常非常实际：它告诉我几乎我认识的每一个人，是怎样发现基督征服他们的心、让他们开始爱他——从来不是只用谦卑而没有论辩，也不是只用论辩而没有谦卑；总是两者一起。除非发生一些事让你看见：你并没有掌控人生所需要的一切，你并不够格来经营你自己的生命；除非他对付你的“高处”，你永远不会来到他面前。但另一方面，如果你以为他会在你不思考的情况下来、你也会在不思考的情况下来，只靠某种神秘体验，那也不行。两者必须一起发生，必须一起发生。现在我这样作结：首先，对那些从未真正把自己交给他的人，请想一想：你现在所经历的一些使你谦卑的事，可能正是君王在试图让你爱他——他在对付你的“高处”。不要说：他为什么要这样对我？记住：他是温柔谦和的，这是第一节。他非常温柔谦和；但他会做需要做的事——那会让他心痛。耶利米哀歌第三章说：他不甘心使人受苦。注意那句话：他不喜欢。它不是说他不做，而是说他不是“甘心乐意”地做——他不喜欢这样做。他是温柔谦和的；马太福音12章说：“压伤的芦苇他不折断，将残的灯火他不吹灭，等他施行公理，叫公理得胜。”但他会做。如果你抗拒他，就不要试探他，因为他会做需要做的事来拆毁你的高处，因为他爱你。或者从另一方面说：你也必须开始思考。你必须开始阅读，你必须开始学习；你必须去上课；你必须研读圣经；你必须和别人谈。你永远不会通过某种神秘体验把自己带到基督面前。你必须决定：我能不能接受基督信仰？我能不能接受基督信仰的教导？这些事情必须发生。也许现在需要做的正是这样：在他大能的手下谦卑，他就在适当的时候升高你。你知道，一个完美的——事实上我不知道他是不是这样，但约翰·多恩（John Donne）有一首很精彩的十四行诗，总结了这段经文，几乎让人难以不觉得他写它时心里有这段经文。你听过的：‘Batter my heart, three-person’d God; for you as yet but knock, breathe, shine, and seek to mend; That I may rise and stand, o’erthrow me, and bend your force to break, blow, burn, and make me new.’ 听见了吗？“为使我能起来站立，推翻我，弯折我；用你的力量打破、吹散、焚烧，使我更新。”那些“高处”。他又说：‘I, like an usurp’d town to another due, labor to admit you, but oh, to no end; Reason, your viceroy in me, me should defend, but is captiv’d, and proves weak or untrue. Yet dearly I love you, and would be loved fain, but am betroth’d unto your enemy; Divorce me, untie, or break that knot again; Take me to you, imprison me, for I, except you enthrall me, never shall be free, nor ever chaste, except you ravish me.’ 是的，征服我。愿意让他拆毁你的“高处”；愿意思考。还有，基督徒朋友们，我还要对你们说一件事：你会说，“我已经把自己交给基督了，他是我的主和救主。”但每一个念头都被掳去了吗？承认这一点非常难。认知疗法的治疗师们有点在做类似的事，只是他们不放进基督教内容。它大概是这样：你是否沮丧？你是否焦虑？你是否好一点？看看你在对自己说什么，是什么引发了那种情绪。那里总有一个念头，你知道的。你知道，这里有一个人，发生同样的事也会发生在Mrs.

A太太和B太太，但A太太没事，B太太却沮丧。为什么？并不是境况使A太太和B太太沮丧或安然无恙，而是太太所……

A 和 B 各自对自己说的话不一样；他们对自己说的那些话，正是让他们沮丧的原因。你知道，某件坏事发生在 B 太太身上，她心里对自己说：“看吧，就像我父亲说的，我永远不会有出息。”她就会陷入沮丧。而如果同样的事情发生在 A 太太身上，A 太太却会对自己说：“正如主耶稣对我说的，‘即使你的心定你的罪，神比你的心更大’。”换句话说：如果你沮丧，就去找到最底下的那个念头；如果你生气，就去找到最底下的那个念头；如果你焦虑，就去找到最底下的那个念头，然后让耶稣把它抓住——让他把它扔出去，把他的真理放进去。这就是你的问题：让他掳掠每一个意念。

“带我归你，把我囚禁，因为我接受你；又投掷我——否则我永不会自由，也永不会贞洁，除非你夺取我。”

让我们向君王祷告。让我们祷告：

我们的父啊，我们感谢你，因为你以这样的方式来到我们这里：为要赢得而寻求推翻；为要扶我们进入得胜而寻求击败我们。求你帮助我们看见你的心意，帮助在座每一个人看见你对他或她的心意。我们生命中此刻正在发生一些事，若不透过《哥林多后书》第十章这段经文来看我们自己，就无法明白。我们求你借着圣灵，使我们能把这些应用出来。我们奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。

你听过吗？约翰·多恩（John Donne）那首诗《击打我的心》（“Batter my heart”）：

“击打我的心，三一的上帝；
因为你至今只是敲门、吹拂、照耀，想要修补。
但愿我能起来、站立——推翻我，并折弯我；
用你的力量来打破、击打、焚烧，使我成为新的。

我，像一座被篡夺的城，属于另一个人；
我辛劳想让你进入，却徒劳无功。
理性，你在我里面的副王，本该护卫我，
却被俘虏，显得软弱、不真实。

然而我深深爱你，也愿被你所爱；
可我却已许配给你的仇敌。
所以求你与我离婚，解开——或再一次打断那结；
带我归你，把我囚禁，因为我接受你；又投掷我——
否则我永不会自由，也永不会贞洁，除非你夺取我。”

是的，征服我。愿意让他拆毁你那些“高高的事物”。愿意去思想。

还有，基督徒朋友们，我再对你们说一件事：听着——你可能会说：“我已经把自己交给基督了，他是我的主和救主。”可是，你的每一个意念都被掳去了吗？承认这一点真的很难。

认知疗法的治疗师多少也在做这件事，只是他们不把基督教的内容放进去。他们是这样说的：你抑郁吗？你焦虑吗？你痛苦吗？看看你在对自己说些什么——正是那些话引发了那种情绪。总有一个更深处的念头，在下面。

你知道，你知道——比如说，有一个人：同样的事情发生在 A 太太身上，也发生在……

B，然而 A 太太却还好，B 太太却陷入抑郁。为什么？使 A 太太和 B 太太抑郁或安然无恙的，并不是处境本身；而是 A 太太和 B 太太在对自己说什么——正是她们对自己说的话使她们陷入抑郁。你知道，如果有不好的事发生在 B 太太身上，而她对自己说：“看吧，就像我父亲说的那样，我永远都不会有出息。”她就会抑郁；如果同样的事发生在 A 太太身上，而 A 太太却对自己说：“正如我的主耶稣对我所说的：‘你的心若责备你，神比你的心大。’”——换句话说，如果你抑郁，就去找出最底层的那个念头；如果你愤怒，就去找出最底层的那个念头；如果你焦虑，就去找出最底层的那个念头，然后把它交给耶稣去俘获，让他把它丢出去，把他的真理放进去——你的问题就在这里。

把每一个意念都掳来，使它顺服你，把我带到你那里，囚禁我，因为我接纳你；把我抛向你，我永不再得自由，也永不再被追逐，除非你夺取我、征服我。让我们向这位君王祷告，让我们祷告：我们的天父，我们感谢你，因为你以这样的方式来到我们中间——你寻求推翻，是为了赢得；你寻求击败我们，是为了把我们带入得胜。求你帮助我们看见你的设计是什么，也帮助在座每一个人看见你对他或她的设计是什么。我们此刻生命里正在发生的一些事，只有当我们借着《哥林多后书》第十章这段经文来看待自己时，才会明白。我们求你藉着圣灵，使我们能够把这信息应用出来。我们奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。
