today's podcast where Tim Keller explores the person and promises of Jesus Christ.  2 Corinthians 10, 1-6. This is Paul speaking. By the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I appeal to you, I, Paul, who am timid when  face to face with you, but bold went away. I beg you that when I come I may not have to be as bold as I expect to be toward some  people who think that we live by the standards of this world. For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does.

The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world, on the contrary. They have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments in every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of  God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ. And we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience once your obedience is complete. And this is God's word.

We've been talking about Jesus as prophet, priest, and king. There's a place in Matthew 12 where Jesus says, the men of Nineveh will stand up in judgment  and condemn this generation. For they repented at the preaching of Jonah and behold a greater than Jonah is here. And the queen of the south will rise up on the judgment day and condemn this generation  for she came from the ends of the earth to Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon  is here. That's a very dramatic statement.

And you see what he's saying? He is saying, a greater than Jonah, I'm the ultimate prophet, a greater than Aaron or  Moses on the ultimate priest, a greater than Solomon on the ultimate king. That's quite a challenge, and that's quite a claim. But what we're going to look at here tonight is what does that mean? Now it shouldn't come of surprise to you that historically Christians and people who  have studied the Bible have seen that Jesus Christ executes his office.

That means he carries out his office of king in two different ways. He carries it out spiritually in the hearts of his people and he carries it out cosmically  in history. And we're not going to talk about the second ones tonight. We're going to talk about the first one. Because what we have here is an interesting description of how Jesus Christ approaches  the human heart.

What does it say? It says, though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does. The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world in the contrary. They have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments and every pretension it sets itself up against the knowledge of  God and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.

What is this describing? First of all, what is describing implicitly and then secondly, what is describing explicitly? Implicitly, tacitly, in other words, it's unstated but completely assumed and therefore  taught in the passage that Jesus Christ is king. And the reason we say Jesus Christ is king is because it says every thought has to be obedient  to Christ. Every thought.

My neighbor comes to me and asks me for a cup of sugar. And if I say no to my neighbor, I may be unkind, I may be rude, I may be uncompassionate,  I may be a bad neighbor but I'm not disobedient. You're only disobedient if you owe something to somebody, if that person has some rights  over you. And the fact that every thought, not just part but every thought of my life and my heart,  every dimension therefore of my being has to be made obedient to Christ means he's my absolute  monarch. So for example, I may have to be obedient to the police officer, why?

Well, it's part of what it means to be a citizen of the city. The police officer asked me to do something and I should obey because in a certain narrow  focus or scope, in a certain narrow scope, the police officer has rights over me. Now, it's all part of the social contract, it's all part of what it means when I decide  to live in a place like New York City and when I become a citizen of the United States  and when I elect representatives and they appoint this and they appoint that, the police officer  cannot tell me who to marry. At that point, the police officer is making a suggestion. The police officer says, I want you to marry my sister-in-law or I'm going to give you  a ticket.

You can't do that. He's got a scope. He says, you must do this when you get to that stop sign or I'm going to run you in. He has the right to do that. He has rights over me.

So there is a part of my life in which I have to obey the police officer and then of  course you can talk about all sorts of relationships we have in which we owe things to people. A person who's done a great deed for you, a good friend. And very often, if that person is sacrificed for you and you know that that person has done  something for you, you sense a certain moral authority that that person has over you. You don't have to spell it out. You don't have to think it out.

You just recognize a moral authority. And you know therefore that if that person who has, let's just say, a person who gave  you enough money to stay in school, that last semester, so you could graduate. So you were able to make it through college. If a person like that comes to you and asks for a cup of sugar and you say no, you probably  are in a sense being disobedient because you realize that a small request like that from  a person like that is is disobedient because that person has some kind of moral right over  you. So when we talk about obedience, we mean the person we owe some kind of authority to, some  kind of deference to.

In this case, we have an unparalleled claim. It doesn't just say that Jesus Christ wants you, wants you on Sunday or Jesus Christ just  wants your will. He wants you to obey the Ten Commandments. It says Jesus Christ is demanding the captivity of every thought. That means his authority and his moral authority over you is absolute.

Well, where does the Bible come off saying that? And it comes off this way and think about the logic of it and it's overwhelming logic,  I think. Were you created or are you an accident? There's really nothing in the middle, you know? Did someone or something with intelligence, rationality, something with a purpose create  you?

If not, you are an accident and you know we sometimes spend time on this, I won't spend  much time on this, but just think it out. Then we see a lump of lead that fell off of the, out of the sleuths in the factory which  is taking lead and turning it into this or that part. And if a piece falls off, molten lead and it falls to the floor and it just forms some  kind of arbitrarily formed puddle, and then it hardens, what do we call that? It's an accident. You don't look at that thing and say, what's it for?

Can you break it? By the way, if you pick it up and it sort of squished and all like this and then you break  it over your leg and it falls into two pieces, you don't say, oh, you broke it. You don't say that because it was already broke because it had no purpose. It wasn't useful. You might be able to use it as a door stop or something like that, but you see it wasn't  created for a purpose.

So it's an accident. So there's no way to violate it and there's no way to break it and has no purpose. For you, you, the result of the blind collision of forces. Are you an accident? Are you an accident of evolution?

Are you an accident of chemical reactions? Are you an accident? In that case, there is no purpose for you. There's no right or wrong for you. There's no intention for your life.

There's no meaning for your life. There's no way for you to be broken. You may feel I'm depressed. There's something wrong. If you aren't created, how are you to say what's wrong?

That's wrong. Whatever is is. Nobody likes to live with that, nobody likes to believe that, and also nobody really  does believe that because you sense that there is something about me that is of design. So most of us want to say I was created. I'm not an accident, but if you were created, what rights would your creator have over  you?

Think of it this way. What if you had poured tremendous amount of energy, creative energy, all of your  talents into a song? It's the best song you ever wrote, okay, you musicians. And before you have a chance to copyright it, somebody picks it up, sells it him or herself,  gets the credit for it, and makes a zillion dollars. How would you feel?

Now because you were so maybe dumb as to not get a copyrighted, there's no way that you  can really, legally, say, that's mine. You can't prove it. But the person did was perfectly legal. Yet you would feel I have moral rights, I have moral rights over that song. Why?

If it wasn't for me, it wouldn't exist. And the one using it couldn't have produced it. Now this is all intuitive. We all know this. There's nobody in this room who would not experience that the same way.

You see, if it wasn't for me, it wouldn't exist. And the one using it couldn't have produced it and therefore should, I have moral rights. I have more rights. Not saying I don't want anybody else to enjoy the song, I'm not saying I don't want anybody  else to use the song. But I should have the ultimate moral rights over that thing.

Or the same thing would happen if you invented a new fuel injection apparatus for an automobile  in your basement so that the car that uses it would get 300 miles to a gallon. Somebody else comes along and takes it. Starts using it. How would you feel? You have moral rights over that.

If it wasn't for me, it wouldn't exist. Now, what if, and plenty of you do, and plenty of us do, and all of us do, at a certain  point, before we get converted into Christianity, what if you decide, I alone have the right  to decide what to do with my body, what to do with my sexuality, what to do with my talent,  how to spend my money, how to use my time, I and I alone. Did you produce that talent? Whether you're an accident, or you've been created, in which case, that creator, if we could  find them, if we could communicate with them, if there's a creator, has ultimate moral rights  over you, and for you to be going off and taking the things, the things that have risen  out of resources that you did not generate, you couldn't have produced, and using them  for your own profit, without deference to him, without saying, what do you want me to do  with my money, what do you want me to do with my talent, what do you want me to do with my  brain, what do you want me to do with my sexuality, just as bad, or worse, because let me tell  you, the creative energy that goes into a song is great as that it is nothing like the  creative energy that goes into a human being. Every thought, every moment, every dimension of your life belongs to the one who created  it, without which, without whom, excuse me, without whom, none of this would exist, none  of you would exist, no part of you would exist, see?

Therefore, when the Bible says, every thought, every one of your thoughts belongs to Jesus,  it is assuming that this is the one who created you, and let me tell you one thing, there  really isn't much in between. You can either say, I'm an accident, and therefore I can do anything I want, but you have to live  with the consequences of the fact there's no right and wrong, if to live with the consequence  of the fact there is no meaning except that which you manufacture, if to live with all that,  or else you have to say, I owe my creator every single thought, every dimension, not just  Sunday's, not just a tip of the hat, everything, absolute, rightful king, and before we move  on, let me just appeal to you, I want you all to know that most of you are Americans, and  even those of you who aren't from America have maybe been here long enough to sort of  imbibe the American, Western, individualistic culture, and I want you to know and be aware  and be completely cognizant of how prejudiced you are against this whole idea. When you come to the Bible, and when you come to the Christian message, you have to realize  what a filter you have over your mind, and you're screening out an awful lot of the absolute  natures of the claims of Christ and the message of Christianity, because John Guest is an  Episcopalian pastor who has been in America for a long time, but he came here in his 20s  from Britain, he was an Anglican minister, and years ago I heard him give a talk, and  I don't know if he mentions this illustration anymore, maybe you heard it, if you know him  or heard him before, he, when he first came to this country he said he was struck, because  he went to a some historic site, and he was going into a place that was a revolutionary  war era tavern, that had been preserved the way it was in America during the Revolutionary War,  this must have been either filled out for your Boston I think, and he went in and he saw the tavern,  and he noticed it was a sign from the era, up, over the tables, and it said we serve no sovereigns  here, you know, kind of American in your face, we don't have kings here, we've got presidents,  they do what we want, if they don't do what most a 51% of us want, they're out of there,  we don't have kings, we serve no sovereigns here, and John Guest said he suddenly realized he  was in a different culture, he said you know, he says in Europe we're secular people, I said you  know we're not this wonderful, we're not wonderfully moral people, he says but I tell you at least  we still have some positive memories of bowing the need to a sovereign, we at least have some  positive vibrations about that, people from the East, Asians very often also come from a situation  in which at least the positive benefits of authority and submission are held up, but when you come  to America, you come to one place where that notion, the notion of a king is anathema, the notion  of a king is really repugnant, it's very much a part of who we are, it's very deep in us,  there is no higher authority than my individual conscience, and every single person who's been  in America for very long, that is so much a part of us that nobody, no Americans ever come to  these kinds of passages and this kind of teaching objective, you're not objective, you are not open  minded when it comes to these things, you hate the idea, we'll get into why I admit, but you have  to see that, but what do you do about it? What do you do about it is this, it's a great place, and I  can't quote it exactly, but it's really sunk into my memory, in a book, which is probably at the  book table or it ought to be, or we'll be soon, right David, because I'm mentioning it, so you'll  be run with it, a Becky Pippert wrote a book called Out of the Salt Shaker, which is really a book  on how to share what Christ has done for you with other people, there's this one wonderful section  in which she says, just remember, when people say they want to be free and they don't want to have  to submit to a king, just remind them that everybody's got a king, everybody's got a lord, and she says  something like this, she says, those who seek power, those who seek power, that's the thing you're  seeking, then you're serving power, power is mastering and ruling you, it's really what drives you,  if you want approval in life, then you will be mastered, you see, ruled by image, or what people  think of you, if you want money, then you will be ruled by money, if you say, ah listen, if you say,  I don't, I don't submit to anybody, I belong to myself, then you're ruled by independence,  you're the kind of person that has to do things, you have to do things, just to show that you don't  owe anybody anything, and if you have to show that you don't owe anybody anything, to show that  you owe nothing to anybody, that nothing rules you, you're ruled by your own independence,  or no matter what, something is your lord, something is your king, you don't belong to yourself,  so you have to realize the Christianity is not saying, you over here, you're free, you know,  you don't serve anything but yourself, come and be captive to Christ, no Christianity, the offer of  Christianity is this, you're a captive to something, your thoughts are captive to something, you know  they are, the things that you feel like you've got to have, your thoughts are captive, you do not  belong to yourself, and so the Christian message is, stop being ruled by things that tyrannize you and  start being ruled by the one king that won't tyrannize you because he is your rightful king,  he's the one that knows how you run, he's the one that knows who you are,  and therefore you don't go from freedom to slavery to become a Christian, you go from slavery to  freedom, because freedom is not a lack of a master, freedom is not the lack of a king but it's  finding a true king for everybody's got one, no one is his or her own, so secondly, first we saw  that this is implicit, Jesus is the king, every single part of you must be obedient to him,  that's the implicit, but then explicitly it tells us how he exercises this kingship in our lives,  and you know how he does it? This is very, very bold and also really neat, he is a conqueror,  that means the way Jesus Christ exercises his kingship in our lives is he sees us as having captured  a heart that belongs to himself, some other things are ruling in there, and therefore Paul says  what Jesus does as a king is he comes and besieges your heart, the way a king would besiege  his capital, that his now fallen under enemy hands, and this is something that Jesus does  and unless you understand that this is the way in which he works, this is how he exercises his  kingship, a lot of you are not going to be able to understand what's going on in your life right  now, right now you may be under siege, there may be divine weapons being shot at you,  see you may be finding that arguments and pretensions are being demolished by some kind of spiritual  weaponry, this is what Jesus does to the human heart, this is how he comes, he comes as a conquering  but let's see what the features of this, the features are, first this work is not a violent work  in a sense of being physically violent or it's not a coercive violence at all, instead the kind  of conquering that Jesus does is he seeks to win your heart and that literally means he seeks to  get you to fall in love with him, that's the conquest, you know we have some predilection to  talk this way when it comes to romance, you know we do talk a little bit about that, we talk like that  sometimes, some of the love poetry says you've conquered me, all right I you know I didn't know  who you were, I didn't really like you at first and yet I've been won by you, you see you've captured  my heart, we use that sometimes in sort of drippy hyperbolic ways you know when we talk about what's  happened to us when we fall in love but Jesus actually is using that terminology almost literally,  look first of all his conquering work is full of gentleness and meekness in the very first verse  Paul who's about to tell us that he is in Jesus army he's a preacher and he's a church planter  and he says I am coming after you but not with my weapons, with divine weapons, in other words  Paul is saying that with the way when he preaches the gospel when he persuades people to turn to  Christ he is actually in Christ's army and therefore he's participating in this kingly conquering  campaign that Jesus does when he besieges the human heart and that's what we see here but look  he starts off talking about this warfare and this conquest by saying by the meekness and gentleness  of Christ I appeal to you so we see that this conqueror is meek and gentle and he's after what  your thoughts he's after your motives in other words he is not trying to get you to be  coerced he's not trying to get you to be a begrudging slave he's not trying to force you to do  thump something that you don't want to he wants to capture your heart he wants to soften your heart  he wants your thoughts see to get your thoughts is to is to get you to see the delight that he is  to see the love that he is to see the freedom that he is and he does it with meekness and gentleness  look for example let me give you a great example of this Psalm 119 a very very long Psalm  I would take you week to read it usually it's it's not a typical Psalm it's got it's very very long  but there's a section of it in fact I could read you any section to show you an example of a conquered  heart but let me read you just a section out of out of it verse 97 and so on right around there  and the Psalmist says behold how I love your law I meditate on it all day long your commands make  me wiser than my enemies further ever with me I have more understanding than my elders for I obey  your precepts I have kept my feet from every evil path that I might obey your word how sweet  are your words to my taste sweeter than honey to my mouth I gain understanding from them therefore  I hate every wrong path now that is the language of a conquered heart that's not the language of  a person who was just raised moral you know people who are raised moral a lot of you were raised  in kind of conservative churches and raised not necessarily Christian churches conservative homes  and conservative backgrounds and when you have a quiet time when you sit down and study the bible  and pray you say I feel better I feel better but you don't feel close to God you just have some  relief in your conscience you're afraid you may know the story of the prodigal son  but it's not just about a wayward younger brother in fact Jesus tells this story to speak both to  those who run from God and to those who try to earn his love by being good in his book the  prodigal God Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart of the gospel a message of  hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental older brother and an invitation  for all to experience God's prodigal extravagant grace whether you're a Christian or you're still  exploring faith the prodigal God will help you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way  the prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the  hope and joy of Christ gracious and relentless love with people all over the world request your  copy today at gospel and life dot com slash give that's gospel and life dot com slash give now  here's doctor Keller with the rest of today's teaching I've had a lot of people tell me and I  know I'm I'm in danger of throwing out here a you know a subject that I'm not going to be able to  get back to and some preaching professor years ago said to me never you know raise more snakes than  you can kill when you're sermon if you raise a snake make sure you have time to kill it I don't  can't do this one but some of you know that one of the things that we say here at the Bible teaches  is that once you become a Christian now there is no condemnation for those who were in Christ Jesus  but once you truly are united to the Father through the Son there's no way that your sins can  bring you ever back into a state of condemnation you're in ah well people say I'm glad I don't  believe will you believe I don't believe that I say what I said well if if I knew  that no matter what I did once I became a Christian there would be no condemnation for me  what a temptation that would be I said well explain that to me how would that be a temptation  say well I wouldn't have any incentive to live a moral life and I would say okay let me get  this straight you're saying that if you would no longer be afraid of God no longer be afraid of his  wrath no longer be afraid of his punishment no longer be afraid of him coming and getting you that  you would lose all your incentive to live a moral life okay let me get this straight all your incentive  is fear all of your incentive is negative and a lot of people who think their Christians  have nothing but a negative morality they come to church because if they don't come to church  they're conscience bothers and that's fine for a start that's a fine way to get on the path  to real Christianity but that's all it is there's people who who are very careful in their business  life to be straight arrows and everybody around them says oh yeah she he yeah very much is straight  out very moral you know don't don't use that kind of language around her don't do this around him  you know don't get them in on a deal like that you know they're pretty straight arrows they wouldn't  like it and so forth and you know that you have that reputation feel pretty good about it it could  all be fear your heart your thoughts your motives never conquered the reason that your moral is  frickly because it's been inculcated in you since you were little you just you know it's very powerful  to be told as a little kid don't do that never do that God will get you if that happens to you  you know you don't lose that over the years and that's fine for a start it is fine for a start  but that's not Christianity Jesus is not after that he's after something far far more  deep than that the psalmist when you read Psalm 119 you'll see for example the psalmist does not see  the Bible he's talking about by law he doesn't see the Bible is strictly a set of nice  he doesn't see it as a book of virtues for example he doesn't see it as a set  of esophs fables with morals at the end of it he calls the word of God he calls the Bible  thy precepts thy commands you see I meditate on them I love them he knows that their words of the  king he knows he has to obey them but look what he says he says they give me insight they make me  great I there's one place where he says I pant after your commands what's going on here  his heart's been captured the big big difference between a Christian and a moral person Paul says  in 2 Corinthians 3 you know you're really a Christian when the law is written on your heart not  just on your conscience when you find in your in most self that the law got a sweet you know in  Psalm 1 it tells you the mark of a godly person it doesn't say godly person praise day and night  though hopefully he or she will doesn't say that the godly person witnesses on the street  corners day and night though of course I hope he will or she will I it doesn't say that that person  goes to church every time the doors are open though I hope you know he or she will attend church  regularly now you can do all that out of fear you know do all that without a heart that's been  captured by the king with your thoughts not captive just your will now what is saying someone it says  for he that's the godly man the lights in the law of God and upon it he meditates day and night  he doesn't just read it and say I got to do it I better do it I better get to know it he meditates  he chews on it he gets the sweetness out of it he loves to see it because he senses that the more  he takes it in the more he's becoming something great he says I have more insight than my elders I  love what this does for me think of it like this what if what if you were a gymnast what if you  were a gymnast let's say you're a young girl but you're now you know you've never quite hit your  peak you what at least you never hit what you think you should be able to do you haven't made it  and how you're starting to get a little old in for your career ever to really be good and you're  kind of frightened and somebody says let's let's take you to a really good coach I know of a good  coach and the coach comes and the coach really starts to rigorously give you a lot of hard exercise  and a lot of hard rules and all that but you begin to soar you begin to win and you begin to jump  higher than you ever have and you begin to your body begins to do things that you never could do  before you're flying because you're obeying and how would you look at the commands of your coach  they'd be sweeter than honey to you you'd pant after them you say more more because I see what  it's doing to me it's it's making me great has that happened to you ever see that's a very big part  of what what Jesus does when he conquers your heart he brings it captive now how does he do it  and the answer is good kings or I should say good generals if they're besieging a city don't just  say to their their armies charge you know when and wherever you want you know a fire will instead  a good king decides where they're going to attack on the wall and we have here two places that  we're told that Jesus attacks it says what it says verse five now don't forget Paul is talking  about we he's part of the army he's part of the thing but he's talking about Jesus campaign  and he says with these with these weapons of divine power we demolish arguments and every  pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God there's two things arguments and  pretensions I'll try to be brief on this because even though each of these would be it would be great  to go in the word arguments means just what it looks like rational arguments the word pretensions  literally means high things proud things that's why that's not a bad it's not a bad you know some of  these words are very hard to translate and the translators when they're sitting there trying to  figure out the best word I know they must agonize that's not bad pretension to pretend means  to try to to to be something that you're not and what this is telling us is there's two ways in  which the king comes after you to win your heart one is more intellectual and one is personal let's  just look at these two things for a minute the first thing is he comes after arguments a lot of  modern people don't want to hear this but let me just explain what that means the Bible tells us  that everybody has faith one of the things is so irritating for a thoughtful Christian when  talking to people who don't believe Christianity is they say well you know if you could prove God  to me I could believe but you can't and the implication is I'm a skeptical person you see I'm  skeptical and I only believe what can be proved and if you're the faith the kind of person has  faith fine you can't prove what you what you believe and if you could prove it to me then I  would be very happy to to believe it's irritating because the assumption is I as a Christian have faith  and it's sort of based on you know nothing and you don't have faith but that's not true the Bible  says at the bottom of every single human being are arguments at the bottom of everyone are arguments  you cannot make a move I gotta make sure I do this concisely and don't go off for 10 minutes  I don't have time for that but you cannot make a choice you could for example just give a quick  example let's just say all of your life you're taught don't have sex apart from marriage you know  you were taught that out in Missouri but then you moved to New York and you come to New York  and hear everybody thinks that only very odd strange people you know would adhere to that  and so you start to feel attracted to somebody who obviously wants to have sex with you and you  decide what you're gonna do it or not do you realize you can't make a decision about that unless  your decision assumes either that the universe is ultimate that there is a creator god that he has  spoken that he's got rules or that there's not if you decide to sleep with a girl or the guy  why well you know intellectually you might not want to work at all out you don't want to work it out  you don't want to think it out but what you've actually done is you've bought the argument that  well there may not be a god but if there is a god we can't know what he teaches right aren't you  assuming that there might be a god but if there is a god we can't know that he said anything about  sexuality that is a religious assumption that is that's an axiom and you're basing your life on it  you can't prove it anymore than I can prove it so you can't prove it's wrong anymore than I can  prove it's right but don't you see what that means you are basing your life and you were  practice on an axiom that is an axiom of faith and you are betting your destiny on it  so when somebody says to me you can't prove god I say you can't prove there isn't god  and even though this doesn't go too far but at least it gets after people at one certain level  you can't prove that there isn't god and yet you're betting your life that there isn't  I can't prove that there is a god and I'm betting my life that there is now we can talk once  you're willing to admit that we both have faith and there were both betting and wagering our lives  on our faith assumptions and we're both deeply religious because science can't tell you what there's  a god or whether there isn't science can't tell you all these things now what Paul is getting at  and what the Bible gets at and there's another other places where it talks about this is that there  are arguments there are rational belief structures there are all there's a matrix of these faith  assumptions underneath you and everybody no matter what you say about what where you stand with  Christianity you've got a belief system you've got a matrix of these things you've got arguments  that you're basing your life on the average non-Christian doesn't want to look at those things  you don't want to look at them my sister-in-law some years ago had an interesting experience where she  was at med school and and they were part she was part of an internship and they were doing the  rounds all the other students were talking about a particular patient they said you know be better  just to turn it all off and let the let the lady die because she's suffering and once she's dead she  won't suffer and sometimes suicide is better because at least when when you're dead you're not  suffering and my sister-in-law looked at them and said can you prove that how do you know that these  people aren't going to hell now she said I'm not trying to argue right now that there is a hell  but I'm trying to show you that your medical decision is assuming there's not well they say well  you know there's no proof well there's no proof that there's not there is no way that you can make  a move without all sorts of religious assumptions that's all I'm trying to say I'm not trying to prove  the Christianity's right I'm not even saying please don't anybody get the impression that I'm saying  that there's no way to show that one set of assumptions is better than another actually that's  the whole point Paul says Jesus Christ will always come and show you your faith assumptions and show  you that they're inferior that they don't explain reality like Christianity does that you can't  really live consistently with them but the point is that Jesus Christ will always in order to win your  heart make you think and I have people all the time coming to me and saying I've got problems in  my life and I just want to connect with God they don't want to think is the Bible true or not well  you know they like their argument that means they like their intellectual construct that allows  them to say who knows but that's a faith assumption they don't want to have to examine it why because  they want to be able to leave things out of the Bible they think that are primitive they don't like  to think that maybe Jesus is the only way to God they think that you know they've got a modern  construct that says all religions are ways to God how do they know that they don't know that it's  a set of arguments they haven't thought it out they haven't thought out if that's logical if it's  possible they don't want to think about that they want peace they want to connect with Jesus they want  to walk by a river side and see the beauty of the Grand Canyon and they just want God to be real to  them so they can handle their lives he never does that without demolishing arguments  he never does that without making you think you see Christianity is based on hard truth objective  truth propositional truth it's true or it's not true but to reject it takes a lot of thinking  as well as to accept it and to reject it takes a faith commitment as well as to accept it and people  aren't even willing to do that Jesus will not deal with you without making you think  all people get very upset about this they don't want to have to think  but he will always come in by demolishing arguments he'll show you there's a rational basis  for what the Bible teaches there's a reason for the hope Christianity is full of truth claims they'll  make you think there's no way to get his peace there's no way for him to capture your heart he'll  always make you think but then on the other hand there's pretensions and you see underneath all the  intellectual objections to the to the kingship of Christ our moral objections pretensions literally  means high things that ultimately Paul was saying that besides the arguments and in some ways the  strength of the arguments is our pride we don't we say we can't believe that's the arguments  because we don't want to obey and that's the pretension pretension means self will the other day  I had the experience of telling a 10 year old boy that his mother needed him he was in a bad  mood and he stood up and he looked at me and he said she always needs me and when I go to her she  asks me to do things that I hate he was furious he was just in a bad mood he was playing a video game  didn't want to go now see I was and I thought about this I said you know that's the way children are  all demands are unreasonable as far as a child's concern all demands are unreasonable I want to do  what I want to do I don't want anybody telling me what to do every time I go to see my mother she has  me to do things I don't feel like doing that's deep that's very deep and you don't think that when  you start to approach God it's gonna go off and therefore there is something in us very deeply  rooted that you have to admit I hope you see it that that keeps you from really being objective when  it comes to Christianity you say I cannot put myself in a place where I am not am out of control I  know what I want no one should have the right to tell me what to do and therefore when the king seeks  to conquer your heart on the one hand he has arguments and he comes after you and he makes you think  but on the other hand he's got to do something about your pride and therefore he puts out all kinds  of humbling conditions and humbling circumstances and things that bring you to the end of your own  resources this to me is a very very very practical verse it's telling me how almost everybody I know has  ever found Christ conquering their heart and getting them getting getting you to love him it's never  just humbling you without arguments or just arguing you without humbling it's always the two together  unless something happens to show you that you do not have what it takes you're not competent to  run your own life unless he does something about your high things you're just never going to come to  him but on the other hand if you think he's going to come to you and you're going to come to him  without thinking just having some kind of mystical experience it won't work either they both come  together they have to come together and now let me conclude this way first of all to those of you  who've really never given yourself to him just think about this you are in a position where you are  going to have to be willing to see that some of the humbling things that are happening to you  maybe because the king is trying to get you to love him he's dealing with your high things  instead of saying why is he doing this to me he's meek and gentle remember that's the first where  he's very meek and gentle but he will do what it takes it'll hurt him it says in lamentations three  he does not willingly afflict the sons of men oh notice what it says he doesn't like it  doesn't say he doesn't do it he says he doesn't willingly do it he doesn't like to do it he's  meek and gentle a bruised reedy will not break it says in Matthew 12 a smoking flaxi will not quench  till he brings forth judgment to victory but he'll do it and if you resist him don't tempt him  because he will do what it takes to bring down your high things because he loves you  or on the other hand you're going to have to start thinking you're going to have to start reading  you have to start studying you have to go to classes you're going to have to study the Bible you  have to talk to other people you're not going to ever get yourself to Christ through a misal  experience you have to decide can I accept the Christian faith can I accept the teachings of  the Christian faith they've got to happen that could be what needs to be done right now humble yourself  under his mighty hand and he will exalt you in due time you know a perfect perfect in fact I don't  know if he did it but John Dunn has his wonderful son at that he wrote and it's it's so much a great  summarizing of this passage that it's hard not to think that he had it in my didn't have it in my  when he wrote it you've heard it John Dunn batter my heart three person God for you as yet but  knock breeze shine and seek to mend but I may rise stand overthrow me and bend your force to  break blow burn and make me new hear that that I may rise and stand or throw me and bend your  force to break blow burn and make me new high things I like a usurp town to another do labor to  admit you but oh to no end reason your vice Roy and me me should defend but is captivated and  proves weak and untrue yet dearly I love you and would be loved feign but I'm betrothed unto  your enemy so divorce me on tire break that knot again take me to you imprison me for I accept you  and throw me never shall be free or ever chased except you ravish me yeah conquer me be willing to  let him bring down your high things be willing to think and Christian friends one more thing to you  guys listen you know you say well I've given myself to Christ he's my Lord and Savior but is  every thought captive it's really tough to admit this the cognitive therapies therapists are sort  of into it but they don't put Christian content and it's it goes like this are you depressed  are you anxious are you better look at what you're telling yourself that causes that emotion there's  always a thought down there you know you know here's here's a person who's the same thing happens to  Mrs.

A and Mrs. B and yet Mrs. A is okay Mrs. B gets depressed why it's not the circumstance that  makes Mrs. A and B depressed are okay it's what Mrs.

A and B is saying to themselves what they're  saying to themselves that makes them depressed you know it's something bad happens to Mrs. B and she  says yet just like my father said I'll never amount to hillabines she'll be depressed and if Mrs. A the  same thing happens Mrs. A but she says to herself as my my Lord Jesus is said to me  though your heart condemning God is greater than your heart in other words if you're depressed find  the thought at the bottom if you're angry find the thought at the bottom if you're anxious find  the thought at the bottom and get it captured by Jesus let him throw it out put his truth in there  that's your problem let him capture every thought  take me to you imprison me for I accept you and throw me never shall be free nor ever chased  unless you ravish me let's pray to the king let's pray our father we thank you that because you have  come to us the way you have seeking to overthrow in order to win seeking to defeat us in order to  lift us to victory help us to see what your your design is and help every person here to see what  your design is for him or her there's things going on in our lives right now that will only be  understood if we see ourselves through this text in 2nd Corinthians 10 we ask that you would make  it possible for us apply this by your Holy Spirit we pray in Jesus name amen you heard it  John done batter my heart three person God for you as yet but knock breeze shine and seek to mend  but I may rise stand over throw me and bend your force to break blow burn and make me new  hear that that I may rise and stand over throw me and bend your force to break blow burn and  make me new hi things I like a usurped town to another do labor to admit you but oh to no end  reason your vice Roy and me me should defend but is captivated and proves weak and untrue  yet dearly I love you and would be loved faint but I'm betrothed unto your enemy  so divorce me on tie or break that knot again take me to you imprison me for I accept you and throw me never  shall be free or ever chased except you ravish me yeah conquer me be willing to let him bring down  your high things be willing to think and Christian friends one more thing to you guys listen  you know you say well I've given myself to Christ I he's my lord and savior but is every thought captive  it's really tough to admit this the cognitive therapies therapists are sort of into it but they  don't put Christian content in it it goes like this are you depressed are you anxious are you  better look at what you're telling yourself that causes that emotion there's always a thought down  you know you know here's here's a person who's the same thing happens to Mrs. A and Mrs.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today's podcast where Tim Keller explores the person and promises of Jesus Christ.  2 Corinthians 10, 1-6. This is Paul speaking. By the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I appeal to you, I, Paul, who am timid when  face to face with you, but bold went away. I beg you that when I come I may not have to be as bold as I expect to be toward some  people who think that we live by the standards of this world. For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does.

The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world, on the contrary. They have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments in every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of  God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ. And we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience once your obedience is complete. And this is God's word.

We've been talking about Jesus as prophet, priest, and king. There's a place in Matthew 12 where Jesus says, the men of Nineveh will stand up in judgment  and condemn this generation. For they repented at the preaching of Jonah and behold a greater than Jonah is here. And the queen of the south will rise up on the judgment day and condemn this generation  for she came from the ends of the earth to Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon  is here. That's a very dramatic statement.

And you see what he's saying? He is saying, a greater than Jonah, I'm the ultimate prophet, a greater than Aaron or  Moses on the ultimate priest, a greater than Solomon on the ultimate king. That's quite a challenge, and that's quite a claim. But what we're going to look at here tonight is what does that mean? Now it shouldn't come of surprise to you that historically Christians and people who  have studied the Bible have seen that Jesus Christ executes his office.

That means he carries out his office of king in two different ways. He carries it out spiritually in the hearts of his people and he carries it out cosmically  in history. And we're not going to talk about the second ones tonight. We're going to talk about the first one. Because what we have here is an interesting description of how Jesus Christ approaches  the human heart.

What does it say? It says, though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does. The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world in the contrary. They have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments and every pretension it sets itself up against the knowledge of  God and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.

What is this describing? First of all, what is describing implicitly and then secondly, what is describing explicitly? Implicitly, tacitly, in other words, it's unstated but completely assumed and therefore  taught in the passage that Jesus Christ is king. And the reason we say Jesus Christ is king is because it says every thought has to be obedient  to Christ. Every thought.

My neighbor comes to me and asks me for a cup of sugar. And if I say no to my neighbor, I may be unkind, I may be rude, I may be uncompassionate,  I may be a bad neighbor but I'm not disobedient. You're only disobedient if you owe something to somebody, if that person has some rights  over you. And the fact that every thought, not just part but every thought of my life and my heart,  every dimension therefore of my being has to be made obedient to Christ means he's my absolute  monarch. So for example, I may have to be obedient to the police officer, why?

Well, it's part of what it means to be a citizen of the city. The police officer asked me to do something and I should obey because in a certain narrow  focus or scope, in a certain narrow scope, the police officer has rights over me. Now, it's all part of the social contract, it's all part of what it means when I decide  to live in a place like New York City and when I become a citizen of the United States  and when I elect representatives and they appoint this and they appoint that, the police officer  cannot tell me who to marry. At that point, the police officer is making a suggestion. The police officer says, I want you to marry my sister-in-law or I'm going to give you  a ticket.

You can't do that. He's got a scope. He says, you must do this when you get to that stop sign or I'm going to run you in. He has the right to do that. He has rights over me.

So there is a part of my life in which I have to obey the police officer and then of  course you can talk about all sorts of relationships we have in which we owe things to people. A person who's done a great deed for you, a good friend. And very often, if that person is sacrificed for you and you know that that person has done  something for you, you sense a certain moral authority that that person has over you. You don't have to spell it out. You don't have to think it out.

You just recognize a moral authority. And you know therefore that if that person who has, let's just say, a person who gave  you enough money to stay in school, that last semester, so you could graduate. So you were able to make it through college. If a person like that comes to you and asks for a cup of sugar and you say no, you probably  are in a sense being disobedient because you realize that a small request like that from  a person like that is is disobedient because that person has some kind of moral right over  you. So when we talk about obedience, we mean the person we owe some kind of authority to, some  kind of deference to.

In this case, we have an unparalleled claim. It doesn't just say that Jesus Christ wants you, wants you on Sunday or Jesus Christ just  wants your will. He wants you to obey the Ten Commandments. It says Jesus Christ is demanding the captivity of every thought. That means his authority and his moral authority over you is absolute.

Well, where does the Bible come off saying that? And it comes off this way and think about the logic of it and it's overwhelming logic,  I think. Were you created or are you an accident? There's really nothing in the middle, you know? Did someone or something with intelligence, rationality, something with a purpose create  you?

If not, you are an accident and you know we sometimes spend time on this, I won't spend  much time on this, but just think it out. Then we see a lump of lead that fell off of the, out of the sleuths in the factory which  is taking lead and turning it into this or that part. And if a piece falls off, molten lead and it falls to the floor and it just forms some  kind of arbitrarily formed puddle, and then it hardens, what do we call that? It's an accident. You don't look at that thing and say, what's it for?

Can you break it? By the way, if you pick it up and it sort of squished and all like this and then you break  it over your leg and it falls into two pieces, you don't say, oh, you broke it. You don't say that because it was already broke because it had no purpose. It wasn't useful. You might be able to use it as a door stop or something like that, but you see it wasn't  created for a purpose.

So it's an accident. So there's no way to violate it and there's no way to break it and has no purpose. For you, you, the result of the blind collision of forces. Are you an accident? Are you an accident of evolution?

Are you an accident of chemical reactions? Are you an accident? In that case, there is no purpose for you. There's no right or wrong for you. There's no intention for your life.

There's no meaning for your life. There's no way for you to be broken. You may feel I'm depressed. There's something wrong. If you aren't created, how are you to say what's wrong?

That's wrong. Whatever is is. Nobody likes to live with that, nobody likes to believe that, and also nobody really  does believe that because you sense that there is something about me that is of design. So most of us want to say I was created. I'm not an accident, but if you were created, what rights would your creator have over  you?

Think of it this way. What if you had poured tremendous amount of energy, creative energy, all of your  talents into a song? It's the best song you ever wrote, okay, you musicians. And before you have a chance to copyright it, somebody picks it up, sells it him or herself,  gets the credit for it, and makes a zillion dollars. How would you feel?

Now because you were so maybe dumb as to not get a copyrighted, there's no way that you  can really, legally, say, that's mine. You can't prove it. But the person did was perfectly legal. Yet you would feel I have moral rights, I have moral rights over that song. Why?

If it wasn't for me, it wouldn't exist. And the one using it couldn't have produced it. Now this is all intuitive. We all know this. There's nobody in this room who would not experience that the same way.

You see, if it wasn't for me, it wouldn't exist. And the one using it couldn't have produced it and therefore should, I have moral rights. I have more rights. Not saying I don't want anybody else to enjoy the song, I'm not saying I don't want anybody  else to use the song. But I should have the ultimate moral rights over that thing.

Or the same thing would happen if you invented a new fuel injection apparatus for an automobile  in your basement so that the car that uses it would get 300 miles to a gallon. Somebody else comes along and takes it. Starts using it. How would you feel? You have moral rights over that.

If it wasn't for me, it wouldn't exist. Now, what if, and plenty of you do, and plenty of us do, and all of us do, at a certain  point, before we get converted into Christianity, what if you decide, I alone have the right  to decide what to do with my body, what to do with my sexuality, what to do with my talent,  how to spend my money, how to use my time, I and I alone. Did you produce that talent? Whether you're an accident, or you've been created, in which case, that creator, if we could  find them, if we could communicate with them, if there's a creator, has ultimate moral rights  over you, and for you to be going off and taking the things, the things that have risen  out of resources that you did not generate, you couldn't have produced, and using them  for your own profit, without deference to him, without saying, what do you want me to do  with my money, what do you want me to do with my talent, what do you want me to do with my  brain, what do you want me to do with my sexuality, just as bad, or worse, because let me tell  you, the creative energy that goes into a song is great as that it is nothing like the  creative energy that goes into a human being. Every thought, every moment, every dimension of your life belongs to the one who created  it, without which, without whom, excuse me, without whom, none of this would exist, none  of you would exist, no part of you would exist, see?

Therefore, when the Bible says, every thought, every one of your thoughts belongs to Jesus,  it is assuming that this is the one who created you, and let me tell you one thing, there  really isn't much in between. You can either say, I'm an accident, and therefore I can do anything I want, but you have to live  with the consequences of the fact there's no right and wrong, if to live with the consequence  of the fact there is no meaning except that which you manufacture, if to live with all that,  or else you have to say, I owe my creator every single thought, every dimension, not just  Sunday's, not just a tip of the hat, everything, absolute, rightful king, and before we move  on, let me just appeal to you, I want you all to know that most of you are Americans, and  even those of you who aren't from America have maybe been here long enough to sort of  imbibe the American, Western, individualistic culture, and I want you to know and be aware  and be completely cognizant of how prejudiced you are against this whole idea. When you come to the Bible, and when you come to the Christian message, you have to realize  what a filter you have over your mind, and you're screening out an awful lot of the absolute  natures of the claims of Christ and the message of Christianity, because John Guest is an  Episcopalian pastor who has been in America for a long time, but he came here in his 20s  from Britain, he was an Anglican minister, and years ago I heard him give a talk, and  I don't know if he mentions this illustration anymore, maybe you heard it, if you know him  or heard him before, he, when he first came to this country he said he was struck, because  he went to a some historic site, and he was going into a place that was a revolutionary  war era tavern, that had been preserved the way it was in America during the Revolutionary War,  this must have been either filled out for your Boston I think, and he went in and he saw the tavern,  and he noticed it was a sign from the era, up, over the tables, and it said we serve no sovereigns  here, you know, kind of American in your face, we don't have kings here, we've got presidents,  they do what we want, if they don't do what most a 51% of us want, they're out of there,  we don't have kings, we serve no sovereigns here, and John Guest said he suddenly realized he  was in a different culture, he said you know, he says in Europe we're secular people, I said you  know we're not this wonderful, we're not wonderfully moral people, he says but I tell you at least  we still have some positive memories of bowing the need to a sovereign, we at least have some  positive vibrations about that, people from the East, Asians very often also come from a situation  in which at least the positive benefits of authority and submission are held up, but when you come  to America, you come to one place where that notion, the notion of a king is anathema, the notion  of a king is really repugnant, it's very much a part of who we are, it's very deep in us,  there is no higher authority than my individual conscience, and every single person who's been  in America for very long, that is so much a part of us that nobody, no Americans ever come to  these kinds of passages and this kind of teaching objective, you're not objective, you are not open  minded when it comes to these things, you hate the idea, we'll get into why I admit, but you have  to see that, but what do you do about it? What do you do about it is this, it's a great place, and I  can't quote it exactly, but it's really sunk into my memory, in a book, which is probably at the  book table or it ought to be, or we'll be soon, right David, because I'm mentioning it, so you'll  be run with it, a Becky Pippert wrote a book called Out of the Salt Shaker, which is really a book  on how to share what Christ has done for you with other people, there's this one wonderful section  in which she says, just remember, when people say they want to be free and they don't want to have  to submit to a king, just remind them that everybody's got a king, everybody's got a lord, and she says  something like this, she says, those who seek power, those who seek power, that's the thing you're  seeking, then you're serving power, power is mastering and ruling you, it's really what drives you,  if you want approval in life, then you will be mastered, you see, ruled by image, or what people  think of you, if you want money, then you will be ruled by money, if you say, ah listen, if you say,  I don't, I don't submit to anybody, I belong to myself, then you're ruled by independence,  you're the kind of person that has to do things, you have to do things, just to show that you don't  owe anybody anything, and if you have to show that you don't owe anybody anything, to show that  you owe nothing to anybody, that nothing rules you, you're ruled by your own independence,  or no matter what, something is your lord, something is your king, you don't belong to yourself,  so you have to realize the Christianity is not saying, you over here, you're free, you know,  you don't serve anything but yourself, come and be captive to Christ, no Christianity, the offer of  Christianity is this, you're a captive to something, your thoughts are captive to something, you know  they are, the things that you feel like you've got to have, your thoughts are captive, you do not  belong to yourself, and so the Christian message is, stop being ruled by things that tyrannize you and  start being ruled by the one king that won't tyrannize you because he is your rightful king,  he's the one that knows how you run, he's the one that knows who you are,  and therefore you don't go from freedom to slavery to become a Christian, you go from slavery to  freedom, because freedom is not a lack of a master, freedom is not the lack of a king but it's  finding a true king for everybody's got one, no one is his or her own, so secondly, first we saw  that this is implicit, Jesus is the king, every single part of you must be obedient to him,  that's the implicit, but then explicitly it tells us how he exercises this kingship in our lives,  and you know how he does it? This is very, very bold and also really neat, he is a conqueror,  that means the way Jesus Christ exercises his kingship in our lives is he sees us as having captured  a heart that belongs to himself, some other things are ruling in there, and therefore Paul says  what Jesus does as a king is he comes and besieges your heart, the way a king would besiege  his capital, that his now fallen under enemy hands, and this is something that Jesus does  and unless you understand that this is the way in which he works, this is how he exercises his  kingship, a lot of you are not going to be able to understand what's going on in your life right  now, right now you may be under siege, there may be divine weapons being shot at you,  see you may be finding that arguments and pretensions are being demolished by some kind of spiritual  weaponry, this is what Jesus does to the human heart, this is how he comes, he comes as a conquering  but let's see what the features of this, the features are, first this work is not a violent work  in a sense of being physically violent or it's not a coercive violence at all, instead the kind  of conquering that Jesus does is he seeks to win your heart and that literally means he seeks to  get you to fall in love with him, that's the conquest, you know we have some predilection to  talk this way when it comes to romance, you know we do talk a little bit about that, we talk like that  sometimes, some of the love poetry says you've conquered me, all right I you know I didn't know  who you were, I didn't really like you at first and yet I've been won by you, you see you've captured  my heart, we use that sometimes in sort of drippy hyperbolic ways you know when we talk about what's  happened to us when we fall in love but Jesus actually is using that terminology almost literally,  look first of all his conquering work is full of gentleness and meekness in the very first verse  Paul who's about to tell us that he is in Jesus army he's a preacher and he's a church planter  and he says I am coming after you but not with my weapons, with divine weapons, in other words  Paul is saying that with the way when he preaches the gospel when he persuades people to turn to  Christ he is actually in Christ's army and therefore he's participating in this kingly conquering  campaign that Jesus does when he besieges the human heart and that's what we see here but look  he starts off talking about this warfare and this conquest by saying by the meekness and gentleness  of Christ I appeal to you so we see that this conqueror is meek and gentle and he's after what  your thoughts he's after your motives in other words he is not trying to get you to be  coerced he's not trying to get you to be a begrudging slave he's not trying to force you to do  thump something that you don't want to he wants to capture your heart he wants to soften your heart  he wants your thoughts see to get your thoughts is to is to get you to see the delight that he is  to see the love that he is to see the freedom that he is and he does it with meekness and gentleness  look for example let me give you a great example of this Psalm 119 a very very long Psalm  I would take you week to read it usually it's it's not a typical Psalm it's got it's very very long  but there's a section of it in fact I could read you any section to show you an example of a conquered  heart but let me read you just a section out of out of it verse 97 and so on right around there  and the Psalmist says behold how I love your law I meditate on it all day long your commands make  me wiser than my enemies further ever with me I have more understanding than my elders for I obey  your precepts I have kept my feet from every evil path that I might obey your word how sweet  are your words to my taste sweeter than honey to my mouth I gain understanding from them therefore  I hate every wrong path now that is the language of a conquered heart that's not the language of  a person who was just raised moral you know people who are raised moral a lot of you were raised  in kind of conservative churches and raised not necessarily Christian churches conservative homes  and conservative backgrounds and when you have a quiet time when you sit down and study the bible  and pray you say I feel better I feel better but you don't feel close to God you just have some  relief in your conscience you're afraid you may know the story of the prodigal son  but it's not just about a wayward younger brother in fact Jesus tells this story to speak both to  those who run from God and to those who try to earn his love by being good in his book the  prodigal God Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart of the gospel a message of  hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental older brother and an invitation  for all to experience God's prodigal extravagant grace whether you're a Christian or you're still  exploring faith the prodigal God will help you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way  the prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the  hope and joy of Christ gracious and relentless love with people all over the world request your  copy today at gospel and life dot com slash give that's gospel and life dot com slash give now  here's doctor Keller with the rest of today's teaching I've had a lot of people tell me and I  know I'm I'm in danger of throwing out here a you know a subject that I'm not going to be able to  get back to and some preaching professor years ago said to me never you know raise more snakes than  you can kill when you're sermon if you raise a snake make sure you have time to kill it I don't  can't do this one but some of you know that one of the things that we say here at the Bible teaches  is that once you become a Christian now there is no condemnation for those who were in Christ Jesus  but once you truly are united to the Father through the Son there's no way that your sins can  bring you ever back into a state of condemnation you're in ah well people say I'm glad I don't  believe will you believe I don't believe that I say what I said well if if I knew  that no matter what I did once I became a Christian there would be no condemnation for me  what a temptation that would be I said well explain that to me how would that be a temptation  say well I wouldn't have any incentive to live a moral life and I would say okay let me get  this straight you're saying that if you would no longer be afraid of God no longer be afraid of his  wrath no longer be afraid of his punishment no longer be afraid of him coming and getting you that  you would lose all your incentive to live a moral life okay let me get this straight all your incentive  is fear all of your incentive is negative and a lot of people who think their Christians  have nothing but a negative morality they come to church because if they don't come to church  they're conscience bothers and that's fine for a start that's a fine way to get on the path  to real Christianity but that's all it is there's people who who are very careful in their business  life to be straight arrows and everybody around them says oh yeah she he yeah very much is straight  out very moral you know don't don't use that kind of language around her don't do this around him  you know don't get them in on a deal like that you know they're pretty straight arrows they wouldn't  like it and so forth and you know that you have that reputation feel pretty good about it it could  all be fear your heart your thoughts your motives never conquered the reason that your moral is  frickly because it's been inculcated in you since you were little you just you know it's very powerful  to be told as a little kid don't do that never do that God will get you if that happens to you  you know you don't lose that over the years and that's fine for a start it is fine for a start  but that's not Christianity Jesus is not after that he's after something far far more  deep than that the psalmist when you read Psalm 119 you'll see for example the psalmist does not see  the Bible he's talking about by law he doesn't see the Bible is strictly a set of nice  he doesn't see it as a book of virtues for example he doesn't see it as a set  of esophs fables with morals at the end of it he calls the word of God he calls the Bible  thy precepts thy commands you see I meditate on them I love them he knows that their words of the  king he knows he has to obey them but look what he says he says they give me insight they make me  great I there's one place where he says I pant after your commands what's going on here  his heart's been captured the big big difference between a Christian and a moral person Paul says  in 2 Corinthians 3 you know you're really a Christian when the law is written on your heart not  just on your conscience when you find in your in most self that the law got a sweet you know in  Psalm 1 it tells you the mark of a godly person it doesn't say godly person praise day and night  though hopefully he or she will doesn't say that the godly person witnesses on the street  corners day and night though of course I hope he will or she will I it doesn't say that that person  goes to church every time the doors are open though I hope you know he or she will attend church  regularly now you can do all that out of fear you know do all that without a heart that's been  captured by the king with your thoughts not captive just your will now what is saying someone it says  for he that's the godly man the lights in the law of God and upon it he meditates day and night  he doesn't just read it and say I got to do it I better do it I better get to know it he meditates  he chews on it he gets the sweetness out of it he loves to see it because he senses that the more  he takes it in the more he's becoming something great he says I have more insight than my elders I  love what this does for me think of it like this what if what if you were a gymnast what if you  were a gymnast let's say you're a young girl but you're now you know you've never quite hit your  peak you what at least you never hit what you think you should be able to do you haven't made it  and how you're starting to get a little old in for your career ever to really be good and you're  kind of frightened and somebody says let's let's take you to a really good coach I know of a good  coach and the coach comes and the coach really starts to rigorously give you a lot of hard exercise  and a lot of hard rules and all that but you begin to soar you begin to win and you begin to jump  higher than you ever have and you begin to your body begins to do things that you never could do  before you're flying because you're obeying and how would you look at the commands of your coach  they'd be sweeter than honey to you you'd pant after them you say more more because I see what  it's doing to me it's it's making me great has that happened to you ever see that's a very big part  of what what Jesus does when he conquers your heart he brings it captive now how does he do it  and the answer is good kings or I should say good generals if they're besieging a city don't just  say to their their armies charge you know when and wherever you want you know a fire will instead  a good king decides where they're going to attack on the wall and we have here two places that  we're told that Jesus attacks it says what it says verse five now don't forget Paul is talking  about we he's part of the army he's part of the thing but he's talking about Jesus campaign  and he says with these with these weapons of divine power we demolish arguments and every  pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God there's two things arguments and  pretensions I'll try to be brief on this because even though each of these would be it would be great  to go in the word arguments means just what it looks like rational arguments the word pretensions  literally means high things proud things that's why that's not a bad it's not a bad you know some of  these words are very hard to translate and the translators when they're sitting there trying to  figure out the best word I know they must agonize that's not bad pretension to pretend means  to try to to to be something that you're not and what this is telling us is there's two ways in  which the king comes after you to win your heart one is more intellectual and one is personal let's  just look at these two things for a minute the first thing is he comes after arguments a lot of  modern people don't want to hear this but let me just explain what that means the Bible tells us  that everybody has faith one of the things is so irritating for a thoughtful Christian when  talking to people who don't believe Christianity is they say well you know if you could prove God  to me I could believe but you can't and the implication is I'm a skeptical person you see I'm  skeptical and I only believe what can be proved and if you're the faith the kind of person has  faith fine you can't prove what you what you believe and if you could prove it to me then I  would be very happy to to believe it's irritating because the assumption is I as a Christian have faith  and it's sort of based on you know nothing and you don't have faith but that's not true the Bible  says at the bottom of every single human being are arguments at the bottom of everyone are arguments  you cannot make a move I gotta make sure I do this concisely and don't go off for 10 minutes  I don't have time for that but you cannot make a choice you could for example just give a quick  example let's just say all of your life you're taught don't have sex apart from marriage you know  you were taught that out in Missouri but then you moved to New York and you come to New York  and hear everybody thinks that only very odd strange people you know would adhere to that  and so you start to feel attracted to somebody who obviously wants to have sex with you and you  decide what you're gonna do it or not do you realize you can't make a decision about that unless  your decision assumes either that the universe is ultimate that there is a creator god that he has  spoken that he's got rules or that there's not if you decide to sleep with a girl or the guy  why well you know intellectually you might not want to work at all out you don't want to work it out  you don't want to think it out but what you've actually done is you've bought the argument that  well there may not be a god but if there is a god we can't know what he teaches right aren't you  assuming that there might be a god but if there is a god we can't know that he said anything about  sexuality that is a religious assumption that is that's an axiom and you're basing your life on it  you can't prove it anymore than I can prove it so you can't prove it's wrong anymore than I can  prove it's right but don't you see what that means you are basing your life and you were  practice on an axiom that is an axiom of faith and you are betting your destiny on it  so when somebody says to me you can't prove god I say you can't prove there isn't god  and even though this doesn't go too far but at least it gets after people at one certain level  you can't prove that there isn't god and yet you're betting your life that there isn't  I can't prove that there is a god and I'm betting my life that there is now we can talk once  you're willing to admit that we both have faith and there were both betting and wagering our lives  on our faith assumptions and we're both deeply religious because science can't tell you what there's  a god or whether there isn't science can't tell you all these things now what Paul is getting at  and what the Bible gets at and there's another other places where it talks about this is that there  are arguments there are rational belief structures there are all there's a matrix of these faith  assumptions underneath you and everybody no matter what you say about what where you stand with  Christianity you've got a belief system you've got a matrix of these things you've got arguments  that you're basing your life on the average non-Christian doesn't want to look at those things  you don't want to look at them my sister-in-law some years ago had an interesting experience where she  was at med school and and they were part she was part of an internship and they were doing the  rounds all the other students were talking about a particular patient they said you know be better  just to turn it all off and let the let the lady die because she's suffering and once she's dead she  won't suffer and sometimes suicide is better because at least when when you're dead you're not  suffering and my sister-in-law looked at them and said can you prove that how do you know that these  people aren't going to hell now she said I'm not trying to argue right now that there is a hell  but I'm trying to show you that your medical decision is assuming there's not well they say well  you know there's no proof well there's no proof that there's not there is no way that you can make  a move without all sorts of religious assumptions that's all I'm trying to say I'm not trying to prove  the Christianity's right I'm not even saying please don't anybody get the impression that I'm saying  that there's no way to show that one set of assumptions is better than another actually that's  the whole point Paul says Jesus Christ will always come and show you your faith assumptions and show  you that they're inferior that they don't explain reality like Christianity does that you can't  really live consistently with them but the point is that Jesus Christ will always in order to win your  heart make you think and I have people all the time coming to me and saying I've got problems in  my life and I just want to connect with God they don't want to think is the Bible true or not well  you know they like their argument that means they like their intellectual construct that allows  them to say who knows but that's a faith assumption they don't want to have to examine it why because  they want to be able to leave things out of the Bible they think that are primitive they don't like  to think that maybe Jesus is the only way to God they think that you know they've got a modern  construct that says all religions are ways to God how do they know that they don't know that it's  a set of arguments they haven't thought it out they haven't thought out if that's logical if it's  possible they don't want to think about that they want peace they want to connect with Jesus they want  to walk by a river side and see the beauty of the Grand Canyon and they just want God to be real to  them so they can handle their lives he never does that without demolishing arguments  he never does that without making you think you see Christianity is based on hard truth objective  truth propositional truth it's true or it's not true but to reject it takes a lot of thinking  as well as to accept it and to reject it takes a faith commitment as well as to accept it and people  aren't even willing to do that Jesus will not deal with you without making you think  all people get very upset about this they don't want to have to think  but he will always come in by demolishing arguments he'll show you there's a rational basis  for what the Bible teaches there's a reason for the hope Christianity is full of truth claims they'll  make you think there's no way to get his peace there's no way for him to capture your heart he'll  always make you think but then on the other hand there's pretensions and you see underneath all the  intellectual objections to the to the kingship of Christ our moral objections pretensions literally  means high things that ultimately Paul was saying that besides the arguments and in some ways the  strength of the arguments is our pride we don't we say we can't believe that's the arguments  because we don't want to obey and that's the pretension pretension means self will the other day  I had the experience of telling a 10 year old boy that his mother needed him he was in a bad  mood and he stood up and he looked at me and he said she always needs me and when I go to her she  asks me to do things that I hate he was furious he was just in a bad mood he was playing a video game  didn't want to go now see I was and I thought about this I said you know that's the way children are  all demands are unreasonable as far as a child's concern all demands are unreasonable I want to do  what I want to do I don't want anybody telling me what to do every time I go to see my mother she has  me to do things I don't feel like doing that's deep that's very deep and you don't think that when  you start to approach God it's gonna go off and therefore there is something in us very deeply  rooted that you have to admit I hope you see it that that keeps you from really being objective when  it comes to Christianity you say I cannot put myself in a place where I am not am out of control I  know what I want no one should have the right to tell me what to do and therefore when the king seeks  to conquer your heart on the one hand he has arguments and he comes after you and he makes you think  but on the other hand he's got to do something about your pride and therefore he puts out all kinds  of humbling conditions and humbling circumstances and things that bring you to the end of your own  resources this to me is a very very very practical verse it's telling me how almost everybody I know has  ever found Christ conquering their heart and getting them getting getting you to love him it's never  just humbling you without arguments or just arguing you without humbling it's always the two together  unless something happens to show you that you do not have what it takes you're not competent to  run your own life unless he does something about your high things you're just never going to come to  him but on the other hand if you think he's going to come to you and you're going to come to him  without thinking just having some kind of mystical experience it won't work either they both come  together they have to come together and now let me conclude this way first of all to those of you  who've really never given yourself to him just think about this you are in a position where you are  going to have to be willing to see that some of the humbling things that are happening to you  maybe because the king is trying to get you to love him he's dealing with your high things  instead of saying why is he doing this to me he's meek and gentle remember that's the first where  he's very meek and gentle but he will do what it takes it'll hurt him it says in lamentations three  he does not willingly afflict the sons of men oh notice what it says he doesn't like it  doesn't say he doesn't do it he says he doesn't willingly do it he doesn't like to do it he's  meek and gentle a bruised reedy will not break it says in Matthew 12 a smoking flaxi will not quench  till he brings forth judgment to victory but he'll do it and if you resist him don't tempt him  because he will do what it takes to bring down your high things because he loves you  or on the other hand you're going to have to start thinking you're going to have to start reading  you have to start studying you have to go to classes you're going to have to study the Bible you  have to talk to other people you're not going to ever get yourself to Christ through a misal  experience you have to decide can I accept the Christian faith can I accept the teachings of  the Christian faith they've got to happen that could be what needs to be done right now humble yourself  under his mighty hand and he will exalt you in due time you know a perfect perfect in fact I don't  know if he did it but John Dunn has his wonderful son at that he wrote and it's it's so much a great  summarizing of this passage that it's hard not to think that he had it in my didn't have it in my  when he wrote it you've heard it John Dunn batter my heart three person God for you as yet but  knock breeze shine and seek to mend but I may rise stand overthrow me and bend your force to  break blow burn and make me new hear that that I may rise and stand or throw me and bend your  force to break blow burn and make me new high things I like a usurp town to another do labor to  admit you but oh to no end reason your vice Roy and me me should defend but is captivated and  proves weak and untrue yet dearly I love you and would be loved feign but I'm betrothed unto  your enemy so divorce me on tire break that knot again take me to you imprison me for I accept you  and throw me never shall be free or ever chased except you ravish me yeah conquer me be willing to  let him bring down your high things be willing to think and Christian friends one more thing to you  guys listen you know you say well I've given myself to Christ he's my Lord and Savior but is  every thought captive it's really tough to admit this the cognitive therapies therapists are sort  of into it but they don't put Christian content and it's it goes like this are you depressed  are you anxious are you better look at what you're telling yourself that causes that emotion there's  always a thought down there you know you know here's here's a person who's the same thing happens to  Mrs.

A and Mrs. B and yet Mrs. A is okay Mrs. B gets depressed why it's not the circumstance that  makes Mrs. A and B depressed are okay it's what Mrs.

A and B is saying to themselves what they're  saying to themselves that makes them depressed you know it's something bad happens to Mrs. B and she  says yet just like my father said I'll never amount to hillabines she'll be depressed and if Mrs. A the  same thing happens Mrs. A but she says to herself as my my Lord Jesus is said to me  though your heart condemning God is greater than your heart in other words if you're depressed find  the thought at the bottom if you're angry find the thought at the bottom if you're anxious find  the thought at the bottom and get it captured by Jesus let him throw it out put his truth in there  that's your problem let him capture every thought  take me to you imprison me for I accept you and throw me never shall be free nor ever chased  unless you ravish me let's pray to the king let's pray our father we thank you that because you have  come to us the way you have seeking to overthrow in order to win seeking to defeat us in order to  lift us to victory help us to see what your your design is and help every person here to see what  your design is for him or her there's things going on in our lives right now that will only be  understood if we see ourselves through this text in 2nd Corinthians 10 we ask that you would make  it possible for us apply this by your Holy Spirit we pray in Jesus name amen you heard it  John done batter my heart three person God for you as yet but knock breeze shine and seek to mend  but I may rise stand over throw me and bend your force to break blow burn and make me new  hear that that I may rise and stand over throw me and bend your force to break blow burn and  make me new hi things I like a usurped town to another do labor to admit you but oh to no end  reason your vice Roy and me me should defend but is captivated and proves weak and untrue  yet dearly I love you and would be loved faint but I'm betrothed unto your enemy  so divorce me on tie or break that knot again take me to you imprison me for I accept you and throw me never  shall be free or ever chased except you ravish me yeah conquer me be willing to let him bring down  your high things be willing to think and Christian friends one more thing to you guys listen  you know you say well I've given myself to Christ I he's my lord and savior but is every thought captive  it's really tough to admit this the cognitive therapies therapists are sort of into it but they  don't put Christian content in it it goes like this are you depressed are you anxious are you  better look at what you're telling yourself that causes that emotion there's always a thought down  you know you know here's here's a person who's the same thing happens to Mrs. A and Mrs.

B and  yet Mrs. A is okay Mrs. B gets depressed why it's not the circumstance that makes Mrs. A and B  depressed or okay it's what Mrs. A and B is saying to themselves what they're saying to themselves  that makes them depressed you know if something bad happens to Mrs.

B and she says yet just like  my father said I'll never amount to a hill of beans she'll be depressed and if Mrs. A the same  thing happens Mrs. A but she says to herself as my my lord Jesus has said to me  though your heart can dem you God is greater than your heart in other words if you're depressed  find the thought at the bottom if you're angry find the thought at the bottom if you're anxious  find the thought at the bottom and get it captured by Jesus let him throw it out put his truth in  there that's your problem come capture every thought take me to you imprison me for I accept you  and throw me never shall be free nor ever chased unless you ravish me let's pray to the king let's  pray our father we thank you that because you have come to us the way you have seeking to  overthrow in order to win seeking to defeat us in order to lift us to victory help us to see  what your your design is and help every person here to see what your design is for him or her  there's things going on in our lives right now that will only be understood if we see  ourselves through this text in 2nd Corinthians 10 we ask that you would make it possible for us  apply this by your Holy Spirit we pray in Jesus name amen

今天的播客中，提姆·凯勒将带我们探讨耶稣基督的位格与应许。哥林多后书 10章1—6节。这是保罗在说话：“我——保罗——凭着基督的温柔和谦和劝你们：我在你们面前时好像谦卑，离开你们时却勇敢。我求你们：我来时不要不得不向某些人显出我以为必须有的那种勇敢；那些人以为我们是凭着属世的标准行事。因为我们虽然在世上行事，却不照着世人的方式打仗。

我们争战所用的兵器，不是属世的兵器；相反，它们有神的大能，能攻破坚固的营垒。我们攻破各样的辩驳和一切自高之事，就是那拦阻人认识神的，并且将各样的心思意念都夺回来，使它顺服基督。等到你们的顺服成全了，我们也预备好了要惩治一切不顺服的行为。”这是神的话。

我们一直在谈论耶稣作为先知、祭司和君王。在马太福音12章有一处，耶稣说：“尼尼微人要在审判的时候起来定这世代的罪，因为他们听了约拿所传的就悔改了；看哪，在这里有一位比约拿更大的。南方的女王也要在审判的日子起来定这世代的罪，因为她从地极而来，要听所罗门的智慧话；看哪，在这里有一位比所罗门更大的。”这是非常震撼的一句话。

你看他在说什么？他是在说：我比约拿更大——我是终极的先知；我比亚伦或摩西更大——我是终极的祭司；我比所罗门更大——我是终极的君王。这是极大的挑战，也是极大的宣称。但我们今晚要看的，是这到底意味着什么。你也不会觉得意外：从历史上看，基督徒以及研究圣经的人都认为，耶稣基督在两种不同的方式上执行他的职分——也就是他如何履行君王的职分：他一方面在他子民的心中属灵地掌权；另一方面在历史中、在宇宙性的层面上掌权。今晚我们不谈第二种，我们要谈第一种。因为这里对耶稣基督如何走近人心，有一个很有意思的描述。

经文怎么说？它说：“我们虽然在世上行事，却不照着世上的样式争战。我们争战的兵器本不是属血气的，乃是在神面前有能力，可以攻破坚固的营垒；将各样的计谋，各样拦阻人认识神的那些自高之事一概攻破，又将人所有的心意夺回，使它都顺服基督。”

这段话在描述什么？首先，它在“隐含地”描述什么？其次，它在“明确地”描述什么？隐含地、默会地——换句话说，这是没有明说却完全被假定、因此也在这段经文里被教导的——就是耶稣基督是王。我们之所以说耶稣基督是王，是因为这里说：每一个思想都必须顺服基督。每一个思想。

我的邻居来找我，要我给他一杯糖。如果我对邻居说“不”，我可能是不友善，我可能很粗鲁，我可能缺乏怜悯，我可能是个糟糕的邻居，但我并不是“不顺服”。只有当你欠某人什么、当那个人对你拥有某种权利的时候，你才谈得上是不顺服。而“每一个思想”——不只是部分，而是我生命和我内心的每一个思想——我存在的每一个维度都必须被带到对基督的顺服之下，这就意味着：他是我的绝对君王。

比如说，我可能需要顺服一位警察，为什么？因为这属于“成为这座城市公民”所包含的意义之一。警察让我做某件事，我应该服从，因为在某一个狭窄的焦点或范围之内，在某一个狭窄的权限范围之内，警察对我有权柄。现在，这都是社会契约的一部分，是我决定住在纽约这样一个地方、成为美国公民、选出代表，而他们任命这个、任命那个时所包含的一部分。警察不能告诉我该娶谁。到了那一步，警察只是在提建议。警察说：“我要你娶我的嫂子（或小姨子），不然我就给你开罚单。”

他不能那样做。他的权柄是有范围的。他可以说：“你到了那个停止标志必须这么做，不然我就把你带走。”他有权这么做。他对我有权柄。

在我生命中有一部分，我必须服从警察；当然，你也可以谈到我们与人之间各种各样的关系——在这些关系里，我们欠别人一些东西。比如一个为你做过大事的人、一个好朋友。很多时候，如果那个人曾为你付出、为你牺牲，而你知道那个人为你做过什么，你就会感到那个人对你有一种道德上的权威。你不需要把它讲得明明白白，也不需要把它想得很周全。

你只是会承认那种道德权威。你也因此知道：假如那个人——比如说，有个人在你最后一个学期给了你足够的钱，让你能继续上学、顺利毕业，使你能把大学读完——如果这样一个人来到你面前，跟你要一杯糖，而你说“不”，你大概在某种意义上就是在“违背”了，因为你意识到：像这样的一个人提出这样一个小请求，你拒绝它，就等于不顺服。因为那个人对你拥有某种道德上的“权利”。所以当我们谈“顺服”时，我们的意思是：我们欠某个人某种权威、某种尊重与让步。

而在这里，我们面对的是一个无与伦比的宣称。它不只是说耶稣基督要你——要你星期天来教会，或耶稣基督只是要你的意志、要你遵守十诫。它说：耶稣基督要求“每一个思想都被掳去”。这意味着，他对你的权柄、他对你的道德权威，是绝对的。

那么，《圣经》凭什么这样说？它之所以这样说，你想一想其中的逻辑，那是一种压倒性的逻辑，我认为。你是被创造的，还是一个意外？其实没有什么中间地带，你知道吗？是不是有某个具备智能、理性、带着目的的“某位”或“某物”创造了你？

如果不是，那你就是个意外——我们有时会花时间讲这一点，我不多讲，但你自己想一想就明白了：我们看到一团铅水从工厂的铅槽里掉出来——那工厂把铅加工成这个或那个零件。若有一滴熔化的铅掉到地上，摊成一滩随意的形状，然后凝固了，我们称它为什么？称它为“意外”。你不会看着那东西说：“它有什么用途？”

你能把它掰断吗？顺便说一句，如果你把它捡起来，它已经软塌塌、扭曲变形成这样，然后你把它往腿上一掰，它就断成两截，你不会说：“哦，是你把它弄断了。”你不会这么说，因为它本来就已经“坏了”，因为它没有用途。它不再有用处。你也许还能把它当门挡之类的东西用用，但你看，它并不是为着一个目的被造出来的。

所以这就是一个意外。所以也就谈不上“违背它”、也谈不上“把它弄坏”；它没有目的。对你来说——你不过是各种力量盲目碰撞的结果。你是个意外吗？你是进化的意外吗？

你是化学反应的意外吗？你是意外吗？如果是那样，你就没有任何目的。对你来说也就没有对错。你的生命也没有任何意图。

你的生命没有意义。你也就不可能被“弄坏”。你可能会觉得：“我很抑郁，好像哪里不对。”可如果你不是被创造的，你凭什么说“哪里不对”？

所谓“不对”也就不对了。事情怎样就是怎样。没有人喜欢这样活着，没有人喜欢相信这一套；而且其实也没有人真的这么相信，因为你心里知道：我这个人身上有某种“被设计”的东西。所以我们大多数人都想说：我是被造的。我不是意外。但如果你是被造的，你的创造主对你有什么权利呢？

这样想：假如你投入了巨大的精力、创造性的能量，把你所有的才华都倾注进一首歌里——这是你写过最好的歌，好吗，各位搞音乐的——可在你还来不及给它申请版权之前，有人把它拿走，当作自己写的去卖，名利都归他/她，还赚了个天文数字。你会有什么感受？

现在，因为你也许“傻乎乎的”没有去登记版权，你在法律上就很难说：“那是我的。”你也无法证明。但那个人做的又完全合法。可你仍然会觉得：我对那首歌有道德上的权利，我对那首歌有道德上的权利。为什么？

因为若不是我，它就不会存在；而使用它的人根本不可能自己把它创作出来。其实这一切都是直觉性的。我们都明白。这个房间里没有一个人不会以同样的方式去感受这件事。

你看，要不是因为我，它根本不会存在。而使用它的人也不可能创造出它，因此——我就应该拥有道德上的权利。我拥有更多的权利。我不是说我不希望别人也能欣赏这首歌，我也不是说我不希望别人使用这首歌。但我应该对那样东西拥有最终的道德权利。

同样的事也会发生在这样的情形里：如果你在自家地下室里发明了一种汽车的新型燃油喷射装置，使得装了它的车能达到一加仑跑三百英里。后来有人走过来把它拿走，开始使用它。你会有什么感受？你对它拥有道德上的权利。

如果没有我，它就不会存在。现在，假如——你们当中很多人这样做，我们当中很多人这样做，其实在某个阶段，我们所有人在还没有归信基督教之前都会这样做——假如你决定：只有我才有权决定如何使用我的身体，如何处理我的性，如何运用我的才干，怎样花我的钱，怎样使用我的时间；只有我，唯独我。那才干是你自己生产出来的吗？不论你是偶然的产物，还是你是被创造出来的——如果是后者，那么那位创造者（如果我们能找到他，如果我们能与他沟通；如果确实有一位创造者）对你就拥有最终的道德权利。而你却把那些东西——那些从你并未产生、你也不可能制造的资源中“生长”出来的东西——拿来为自己谋利，却不顾念他，不问他：“你要我怎样用我的钱？你要我怎样用我的才干？你要我怎样用我的头脑？你要我怎样处理我的性？”这同样糟糕，甚至更糟。因为我告诉你，投入一首歌的创造能量已经很伟大了，但它完全无法与创造一个人的创造能量相比。你生命中的每一个思想、每一个瞬间、每一个维度，都属于那位创造了它的主；没有他——更正一下——没有他，所有这一切都不会存在，你们也不会存在，你们的任何一部分都不会存在，你明白吗？

所以，当《圣经》说：每一个念头——你所有的念头——都属于耶稣时，它是在假定：这位就是创造你的那一位。让我告诉你一件事：中间其实没有多少“折中地带”。你要么说：“我是个偶然事故，因此我想做什么就做什么。”但你就必须承受这样的后果：没有对错；除了你自己制造出来的意义之外，再没有意义。你若愿意活在那一切之下，就可以那么说。要不然，你就必须说：“我欠我的创造主每一个念头、每一个维度——不只是主日，不只是礼貌性地‘致意一下’——而是所有一切；他是绝对的、名正言顺的君王。”

在我们继续往下之前，我想对你们发出一个呼吁：我希望你们都知道，你们大多数人是美国人；就算你不是在美国长大的，你也可能在这里待得够久，多少已经吸进了美国式的、西方式的、个人主义文化。我希望你知道，并且要意识到、要非常清楚：你对“君王”这一整套观念是带着偏见的。

当你来到《圣经》面前、来到基督教信息面前，你必须认识到：你的头脑上罩着怎样的“滤镜”。你正在把基督的宣称和基督教信息中那些“绝对性”的部分筛掉很多，因为约翰·盖斯特（John Guest）是一位圣公会（Episcopalian）的牧师，在美国多年，但他二十多岁从英国来到这里时原本是圣公会（Anglican）的牧师。很多年前我听过他的一次讲座。我不知道他现在还用不用这个例子——也许你听过，如果你认识他或以前听过他讲话。他说他刚来这个国家时非常震撼，因为他去参观一个历史遗址，走进一处保存成“美国独立战争时期”原貌的酒馆（tavern）。这大概是在波士顿一带吧。我想是。进去后他看见酒馆，也注意到在桌子上方挂着一块那个年代的招牌，上面写着：“我们这里不侍奉任何君主（sovereigns）。”很“美国式”的当面宣告：我们这里没有国王，我们有总统；他们得做我们想要他们做的；如果他们不做我们当中多数人——51%的人——想要的事，他们就得下台。我们没有国王。我们这里不侍奉任何君主。

约翰·盖斯特说，他突然意识到自己进入了一个不同的文化。他说：“你知道，在欧洲我们也是世俗的人。”他说，“我们并不是什么特别高尚、特别道德的人。但我告诉你，至少我们仍然对向君主屈膝还有一些正面的记忆；至少我们对那件事还有一些正面的共鸣。”来自东方的人——亚洲人——也常常来自一种文化背景：至少权威与顺服的正面益处还会被肯定。但你来到美国，你就来到一个地方：那种观念——“君王”的观念——是人人厌恶的；“君王”的观念令人反感。这在我们里面很深，是我们身份的一部分：没有比“我个人的良心”更高的权威。

而任何在美国生活得够久的人，这都已经深深成为我们的一部分，以至于没有任何美国人来到这类经文、这类教导面前还能客观——你不客观。谈到这些事，你并不“开放”。你讨厌这个观念。我们会讲到为什么（我承认），但你必须先看见这一点。那么你该怎么办？

你该怎么办？答案在这里。有一段话非常精彩——我不能逐字逐句背出来，但它已经深深刻在我记忆里——出自一本书，这本书可能就在书摊上，或者本来就该在，或者很快就会在，对吧大卫？因为我提到了它，你就会赶紧把它摆出来。贝姬·皮珀特（Becky Pippert）写了一本书叫《走出盐罐》（Out of the Salt Shaker），基本是一本教你如何把基督为你做的事分享给别人的书。书里有一段很棒的内容，她说：记住，当人们说他们想要自由、他们不想顺服一位君王时，你只要提醒他们：人人都有一个君王，人人都有一个主。她大概是这样说的：

“那些追求权力的人——如果你所追求的就是权力——那么你就是在服侍权力；权力正在掌控你、统治你；它其实才是驱动你的东西。若你想要被人认可，那么你就会被‘形象’所辖制、被别人怎么看你所辖制。若你想要金钱，那么你就会被金钱统治。若你说：‘听着，我不顺服任何人，我属于我自己。’那么你就会被‘独立’所统治——你成了那种必须做某些事的人，只为了证明你不欠任何人。若你必须证明你不欠任何人、证明没有任何东西能统治你，那么你其实就是被自己的独立所统治。”

无论如何，总有什么东西是你的主，是你的王。你并不属于你自己。

所以你必须明白：基督教并不是在说，“你在那边，你是自由的，你除了自己谁也不服侍；来吧，来作基督的俘虏。”不是的。基督教的邀请是：你本来就是某种东西的俘虏；你的思想本来就被某种东西俘虏——你知道是这样。那些你觉得“非要不可”的东西正在俘虏你的思想。你不属于你自己。因此基督教的信息是：停止被那些暴虐你的东西统治，开始被那一位不会暴虐你的君王统治，因为他是你名正言顺的君王；他知道你是怎么运转的，他知道你是谁。

所以，成为基督徒不是从自由走向奴役，而是从奴役走向自由。因为自由不是“没有主人”；自由不是“没有君王”，而是找到真正的君王——因为人人都有一个。没有人真正属于自己。

所以第二点：第一点我们看到的是隐含的——耶稣是君王，你的每一个部分都必须顺服他。这是隐含的。但接着经文又明确告诉我们：他如何在我们的生命中施行这君王的权柄。你知道他怎么做吗？这非常大胆，也非常精彩：他是一个征服者。

意思是：耶稣基督在我们生命中施行王权的方式，是把我们看作一座“本属于他”的心城，如今却被别的东西占领着、在里面作王。因此保罗说：耶稣作为君王所做的，是来围攻（besiege）你的心——就像一位君王围攻他的首都，因为首都落入了敌手。这就是耶稣所做的事；除非你明白这是他工作的方式、这是他施行王权的方式，否则你们很多人将无法理解你们生命里正在发生什么。

此刻你可能正处在围困之下：可能有属天的武器正向你发射；你可能发现某些“论证”和“自高之事”（pretensions）正在被某种属灵的武器摧毁。这就是耶稣对人心所做的；他就是这样来临的——他以征服者的身份来临。

不过我们来看一看这征服的特征。首先，这工作并不是暴力的——不是身体上的暴力，也完全不是强迫性的暴力。相反，耶稣的“征服”是要赢得你的心；而“赢得你的心”字面意思就是：他要使你爱上他。这就是征服。

我们在谈恋爱时其实也有这种说法，你知道的，我们有点倾向用这种语言来描述浪漫。爱情诗里会说：“你征服了我。”对吧？“我起初不认识你，甚至一开始并不喜欢你，但我被你赢得了。你抓住了我的心。”我们有时会用那种黏腻、夸张的方式来描述坠入爱河的经历，但耶稣几乎是按字面意义在使用这种术语。

首先，他的征服工作充满温柔与谦和。在第一节里，保罗将要告诉我们：他在耶稣的军队里——他是传道人，是植堂者——他说：“我要来找你们，但不是用我的武器，而是用属天的武器。”换言之，保罗是在说：当他传福音、劝人归向基督时，他其实是在基督的军队中，因此他正在参与耶稣这位君王围攻人心的征服战役。这正是我们在这里看到的。

但注意：他一开始谈这场属灵战争与征服时，就说：“我凭着基督的温柔和谦和劝你们。”所以我们看见：这位征服者是温柔谦和的。他要的是你的什么？你的思想。他要的是你的动机。换句话说，他不是要你被强迫；他不是要你作一个心不甘情不愿的奴隶；他不是要你被逼着去做你不想做的事。他要抓住你的心，他要软化你的心。他要你的思想——因为抓住你的思想，就是让你看见他是何等可喜、他是何等可爱、他是何等自由。他以温柔和谦和来成就这事。

举个很好的例子：诗篇119篇，一首非常非常长的诗。我带你们读可能要读一周。它不是典型的诗篇；它非常长。但其中有一段——其实任何一段都能用来展示“被征服的心”的样子——我读其中一小段，从第97节附近开始。诗人说：

“我何等爱慕你的律法，终日不住地思想。你的命令常存在我心里，使我比仇敌有智慧。我比我的师傅更通达，因我思想你的法度。我比年老的更明白，因我守了你的训词。我禁止我脚走一切的邪路，为要遵守你的话。你的言语在我上膛何等甘美，在我口中比蜜更甜！我藉着你的训词得以明白，所以我恨一切的假道。”

这就是被征服之心的语言。这不是那种“只是从小被教得很道德”的人的语言。

你知道，那些从小被养成道德的人——你们当中很多人在比较保守的教会里长大，或者在并不一定是基督教但很保守的家庭、保守背景中长大——当你有灵修时间，当你坐下来读《圣经》祷告，你会说：“我感觉好多了，我感觉好多了。”但你并不觉得与神亲近；你只是良心获得一些缓解。你可能听过浪子回头的故事，但那不只是讲一个放荡的弟弟；事实上，耶稣讲这个故事，是要同时对两类人说话：一类逃离神，另一类试图靠“做好”来赚取神的爱。在提姆·凯勒的《浪子神》（The Prodigal God）一书中，凯勒展示了这个家喻户晓的故事如何揭示福音的核心：它向悖逆的小儿子和论断人的大儿子都带来盼望，并邀请所有人去经历神那“浪费般、奢华”的恩典。无论你是基督徒，还是仍在探索信仰，《浪子神》都会帮助你用全新的眼光看见你与基督的关系。

现在，请听凯勒博士继续今天的信息。

很多人跟我说过——我知道我现在有点危险，可能抛出一个话题，结果我没法再把它收回来。有位讲道学教授多年前对我说：“讲道时千万别养太多你杀不掉的蛇——你若抛出一条蛇，确保你有时间把它杀掉。”这一条我杀不掉，我做不到。但你们当中有些人知道：我们在这里所教导的一件事是：一旦你成为基督徒，“如今那些在基督耶稣里的，就不定罪了”（罗马书8:1）。一旦你真实地藉着子与父联合，你的罪就不可能再把你带回“被定罪”的状态。你已经在……

人们会说：“我很高兴我不信你信的。我不信那个。”我就说：“为什么？”他们说：“如果我知道，不管我做什么，一旦我成了基督徒就再也不会被定罪——那会是多大的诱惑！”我说：“给我解释一下，怎么会成为诱惑？”他们说：“那我就没有任何动力去过道德的生活。”

我就说：“好，让我把这理清楚：你是在说，如果你不再害怕神、不再害怕他的忿怒、不再害怕他的惩罚、不再害怕他来‘抓你’——你就失去所有过道德生活的动力？好，让我确认一下：你所有的动力都是恐惧；你所有的动力都是负面的。”

很多自以为是基督徒的人，只有一种“负面道德”：他们来教会，是因为如果不来教会良心就不安。这作为起步没问题——这是走上真正基督信仰之路的一个开始——但也仅仅是开始而已。有些人做生意非常谨慎正直，周围的人都说：“哦，是的，她/他很正直，很有道德。你在她面前别说那种话，别在他面前做那种事；别把他们拉进那种交易，他们不会喜欢。”诸如此类。你也知道你有那样的名声，你感觉挺好。但这一切可能全都是恐惧。你的心、你的思想、你的动机从未被征服。你之所以道德，很大程度是因为从小就被灌输：你很小的时候就被告诉“别那样做，永远别那样做；如果你那样做，神会抓你”。这种东西多年以后你也不会轻易丢掉。作为起步这没问题——真的，作为起步是好的——但那不是基督信仰。耶稣要的不是这个；他要的是更深得多的东西。

当你读诗篇119篇，你会看到：诗人并不把他所说的“律法”仅仅看成一套“好主意”；他不把《圣经》看成一本“美德之书”。他并不把它当作《伊索寓言》那样的故事集，最后附上一个道德训示。他称它为神的话；他称《圣经》为“你的训词、你的命令”。你看，“我思想它们，我爱它们。”他知道那是君王的话，他知道自己必须顺服它们。但注意他怎么说：它们给我洞察，使我变得卓越。有一个地方他说：“我切慕你的命令。”这是怎么回事？他的心被抓住了。

保罗在哥林多后书第三章说：你真的成为基督徒，是当律法写在你的心上，而不只是写在你的良心上；当你在自己里面发现律法是甜的。诗篇第一篇告诉你，敬虔人的标记是什么。它并不是说：敬虔人昼夜赞美——虽然我希望他/她会；也不是说：敬虔人在街角昼夜传福音——虽然我当然希望他/她会；也不是说：敬虔人每逢教会开门就去——虽然我希望他/她会规律参加。你知道，这一切你都可能出于恐惧而做；你可能在没有被君王抓住的心、没有被俘的思想的情况下做这些——只有意志被驱动。

诗篇一篇说什么？它说：“他喜爱耶和华的律法，昼夜思想。”他不只是读了就说：“我得做；我最好做；我最好明白。”他思想——他咀嚼——从中取出甘甜——他喜爱看见它，因为他感到：越把它吸收进去，他就越在成为某种卓越的人。他说：“我比年老的更明白。”他说：“我爱它对我做的事。”

这样想：如果你是体操运动员呢？比如你是个年轻女孩，但你从未达到巅峰，至少从未达到你觉得自己应该能达到的水平；你一直没“成”，而你开始在职业生涯上显得有点年纪大了，可能再也不太可能真正出色了，你有点害怕。有人说：“我们带你去找一个很好的教练，我认识一个好教练。”教练来了，开始非常严格地给你很多艰难的训练、很多严苛的规则，但你开始腾跃，你开始赢，你开始跳得比以往任何时候都高，你的身体开始做出以前完全做不到的动作。你在飞翔——因为你在顺服。

那么你会怎么看待教练的命令？它们对你来说会比蜜还甜。你会切慕它们。你会说：“更多，更多！”因为你看见它们正在对你做什么：它们正在使你卓越。

这是不是曾发生在你身上？你看，这就是耶稣征服你心的一大部分：他把你的心掳来。

那么他如何做这事？答案是：好的君王——或者我该说，好的将军——在围攻一座城时，并不会只是对军队说：“冲啊！你们想从哪里冲就从哪里冲，随便开火。”相反，一位好的君王会决定：要攻哪一段城墙。我们在这里看到两处，告诉我们耶稣所攻击的点。

经文说什么？第五节。别忘了：保罗说“我们”——因为他在军队里、参与其中——但他在谈的是耶稣的战役。他说：“我们用这有神能力的兵器，攻破各样的计谋（arguments），各样拦阻人认识神的自高之事（pretensions）。”这里有两样：计谋/论证（arguments）和自高之事/妄自尊大（pretensions）。我尽量简短，因为每一样都值得展开讲。

“arguments”这个词就是字面意思：理性的论证。“pretensions”字面意思是“高的东西、骄傲的东西”。所以译作“自高之事/妄自尊大”并不差。有些词很难翻译；译者在那儿琢磨最好的词时，我知道他们一定很纠结。“pretension（自命不凡/装作）”的意思，是试图成为你不是的那种人。这段经文告诉我们：君王来赢得你心，有两条路径——一条更偏理智，一条更偏个人。

我们花点时间看这两样。

第一，他来对付“论证”。很多现代人不愿听这话，但让我解释意思。《圣经》告诉我们：每个人都有信仰。有一件事在与不信基督教的人对话时，常常让一个认真思考的基督徒很恼火：他们说，“如果你能向我证明神，我就能信；但你不能。”暗示是：我是怀疑论者，我只相信能被证明的东西；你是那种‘有信仰’的人也行——你所信的无法证明；若你能证明给我看，我就很乐意相信。

之所以恼火，是因为它假定：我这个基督徒有信仰，而且好像是建立在“没有什么”之上；而你没有信仰。但这不是真的。《圣经》说：每个人最底层都有论证；每个人底下都有论证。

你不能做任何一个选择——让我确保我讲得简洁，不要展开讲十分钟，我没时间——你不能做一个决定而不带着某种前提。举个快速例子：假设你一生都被教导“不要在婚姻之外发生性关系”。你在密苏里是这样被教的。但你搬到纽约，在纽约你听见周围每个人都认为：只有很奇怪、很古怪的人才会坚持那一点。于是你开始对某个人产生吸引，而对方显然也想与你发生性关系。你要决定：你做还是不做。

你知道吗？你不可能做这个决定，除非你的决定隐含了这样一种前提：宇宙到底是终极的（也就是没有造物主），还是有一位创造主神，并且他已经说话、他有规则；要么就是没有。

如果你决定跟那个女孩/男孩上床，为什么？你在理智上可能不想把这些想透——你不想把它想透，也不想把它想明白——但你实际上已经买下了这样一个论证：也许有神，但即便有神，我们也不可能知道他教导什么。对不对？你是在假设：也许有神，但即便有神，我们也无法知道他是否对性有任何教导。

那是一个宗教性的假设；那是一个公理。你正把你的生活建立在它上面。你也无法证明它，就像我无法证明我所信的一样。你不能比我更能证明“它是错的”，就像我不能比你更能证明“它是对的”。但你看见这意味着什么吗？你正在把你的生活和你的实践建立在一个“信心的公理”上；你正在拿你的命运去赌它。

所以当有人对我说“你无法证明神”时，我会说：“你也无法证明没有神。”即便这句话不能把问题推进得很远，至少它能在某个层面触到人：你无法证明没有神，但你却在用你的生命下注：没有神。我无法证明有神，但我在用我的生命下注：有神。

当你愿意承认：我们双方都有信仰，我们都在拿生命下注、在押注我们的信心前提，我们都深具宗教性——因为科学不能告诉你有没有神，科学也不能告诉你这些事情——那么我们就可以谈下去。

保罗的意思、也是《圣经》在其他地方所说的，是：每个人底下都有论证，有理性的信念结构；在你之下有一整套信心前提的矩阵。无论你怎么说你在基督信仰上的立场，你都有一个信念系统；你有这样一套矩阵；你有你赖以生活的论证。

一般的非基督徒不想去看那些东西。你不想看它们。我嫂子多年前有个有意思的经历：她在医学院实习，查房时其他学生在讨论一个病人。他们说：“最好把机器都关掉，让那位女士死去吧，因为她在受苦；她死了就不受苦了。有时自杀更好，因为至少人死了就不受苦了。”

我嫂子看着他们说：“你能证明吗？你怎么知道这些人死后不会下地狱？”她说：“我不是现在要跟你们争论地狱到底存不存在；我只是想告诉你们：你们的医疗决定是在假设地狱不存在。”

他们说：“嗯，没有证据。”她说：“同样也没有证据证明没有。”你不可能迈出一步而不带着各样宗教性假设。我想说的就只是这个。我不是要证明基督教是对的。我甚至也不是说——请大家不要误会——我不是说“没有办法证明某一套前提比另一套更好”。事实上，那正是重点：保罗说，耶稣基督总会来揭露你的信心前提，并向你显示它们是低劣的；它们不能像基督信仰那样解释现实；你无法在其中活得一致。

重点是：为了赢得你的心，耶稣基督总要使你思考。人们常常来找我说：“我生活里有问题，我只想跟神连接。”他们不想去想《圣经》到底真不真。他们喜欢自己的“论证”——也就是他们喜欢那套智识结构，让他们可以说“谁知道呢”。但那本身就是一个信心前提。他们为什么不愿意检视？因为他们想从《圣经》里删掉他们觉得“原始”的部分。他们不喜欢去想“也许耶稣是通往神的唯一道路”。他们觉得自己有一个现代的结构说“所有宗教都通往神”。他们怎么知道？他们并不知道。那是一套论证，他们没有把它想透；他们没有想过那是否合逻辑、是否可能。

他们不想思考。他们想要平安。他们想与耶稣连接。他们想在河边散步，看见大峡谷的壮丽，只想“神对他们变得真实”，好让他们能应付生活。

他从来不会在不攻破论证的情况下给你这些。他从来不会在不逼你思考的情况下这么做。

你看，基督信仰建立在艰硬的真理之上：客观的真理、命题性的真理。它要么真，要么不真。但拒绝它同样需要大量思考，就像接受它需要思考一样。拒绝它同样需要一个信心的委身，就像接受它需要一样。但人们甚至连做到这一步都不愿意。耶稣不会在不逼你思考的情况下与人打交道。

很多人对这一点很生气。他们不想非得去想。但他总会藉着攻破论证而进入：他会向你显明《圣经》所教导之事有理性的根据；基督信仰的盼望有其理由。基督信仰充满真理宣称，会逼你思考。若他要抓住你的心，就不可能不让你思考；你得不到他的平安。

然而另一方面还有“自高之事”。你看，在所有对基督王权的理性反对之下，其实是道德上的反对。pretensions字面就是“高的东西”；最终保罗是在说：除了论证之外，而在某种意义上那些论证之所以强，是因为我们的骄傲。我们说“我不能信”（那是论证），其实是因为我们不想顺服（那是自高之事）。

“自高之事”就是任性（self-will）。前些天我有个经历：我告诉一个十岁男孩，他妈妈需要他。他情绪很差，站起来看着我说：“她总是需要我！我一去找她，她就叫我做我讨厌的事！”他气坏了，正玩电子游戏，不想过去。

我当时在想：孩子就是这样。对孩子来说，所有的要求都是不合理的：我想做我想做的事；我不想有人告诉我该做什么；每次我去找妈妈，她就让我做我不想做的事。这很深，非常深。你以为当你开始接近神时，这东西就会消失吗？不会。

因此我们里面有一些很深的根——我希望你能看见——这使得我们在面对基督信仰时无法真正客观。你说：“我不能把自己放在一个我不掌控的位置上。我知道我想要什么；没有人有权告诉我该怎么做。”

所以当君王要征服你的心时，一方面他有论证——他来追赶你，逼你思考；另一方面，他必须处理你的骄傲。因此他会摆出各样使你谦卑的条件、使你谦卑的环境、使你走到自己资源尽头的事。

对我来说，这节经文非常非常实际。它告诉我：几乎我认识的所有人，是怎样经历基督征服他们的心、使他们爱上他——从来不是“只有谦卑却没有论证”，也从来不是“只有论证却没有谦卑”，总是两者一起。

除非发生某些事让你看见：你没有能力掌控你自己的人生；除非他对付你那些“高的东西”，你永远不会来到他面前。但另一方面，如果你以为他会临到你、你会来到他面前，而不需要思考、只要某种神秘体验，那也行不通。两者必须一同来到；必须一同发生。

最后我这样结束。

第一，对那些从未真正把自己交给他的人：想一想，你现在所处的位置——你必须愿意看见：一些正在发生在你身上的使你谦卑的事，也许正是因为君王在尝试使你爱上他；他正在对付你那些“自高之事”。不要说“他为什么要这样对我？”记住：他温柔谦和——第一节就是这样说的——他非常温柔谦和；但他会做他必须做的事。这会使他痛苦。耶利米哀歌第三章说：“他并非甘心使人受苦。”注意它怎么说：不是说他不做；而是说他不是“甘心乐意”去做。他不喜欢做。他温柔谦和。“压伤的芦苇，他不折断；将残的灯火，他不吹灭”（马太福音12章），直到他施行公义得胜。但他会做。

如果你抗拒他，别试探他，因为他会做他必须做的，来拆毁你的高傲，因为他爱你。

或者另一方面，你必须开始思考。你必须开始阅读；你必须开始学习；你要去上课；你必须查考《圣经》；你必须和别人交谈。你永远不会靠一种神秘体验把自己带到基督那里。你必须决定：我能否接受基督信仰？我能否接受基督信仰的教导？这些都必须发生。

这可能正是你现在需要做的事：在他大能的手下谦卑，他必在适当的时候升高你。

你知道，一个完美的——完美的——总结这段经文的作品，是约翰·多恩（John Donne）的那首精彩十四行诗。我不知道他是否写作时心里想着这段经文，但它总结得太好了，以至于很难不觉得他是想着它写的。你听过的：

“击打我的心，三一的神；因为到如今你只不过敲击、吹拂、照耀，并试图修补；
好叫我能起来站立。请倾覆我，弯折你的力量来击碎、吹扫、焚烧，使我更新。
我像一座被人篡夺的城，本属于你，却劳苦要接纳你，却徒然；
理性——你在我里面的副王——本该护卫我，却被俘，软弱而不忠。
然而我深深爱你，也渴望被你所爱；
但我却与仇敌订了婚。
所以请你把我离婚、解开、再打断那结；
带我归你，囚禁我，因为除非你俘虏我，我永不得自由；
除非你‘强夺’我（ravish me），我永不得纯洁。”

愿你愿意让他拆毁你的高傲；愿你愿意思考。

而基督徒朋友们，我还要对你们说一件事：你会说，“我已经把自己交给基督了，他是我的主、我的救主。”但每一个念头都被掳去了吗？这真的很难承认。

认知疗法的治疗师们多少也在讲这个（只是他们不放入基督教内容），大意是这样：你是否抑郁？你是否焦虑？你是否……？去看一看你在对自己说些什么，正是那些自我对话造成了那种情绪。那里总有一个念头在底下，你知道的。你知道的：同样的事发生在……太太身上……

A太太和B太太，但A太太没事，B太太却沮丧。为什么？并不是境况使A太太和B太太沮丧或安然无恙，而是太太所……

A 和 B 各自对自己说的话不一样；他们对自己说的那些话，正是让他们沮丧的原因。你知道，某件坏事发生在 B 太太身上，她心里对自己说：“看吧，就像我父亲说的，我永远不会有出息。”她就会陷入沮丧。而如果同样的事情发生在 A 太太身上，A 太太却会对自己说：“正如主耶稣对我说的，‘即使你的心定你的罪，神比你的心更大’。”换句话说：如果你沮丧，就去找到最底下的那个念头；如果你生气，就去找到最底下的那个念头；如果你焦虑，就去找到最底下的那个念头，然后让耶稣把它抓住——让他把它扔出去，把他的真理放进去。这就是你的问题：让他掳掠每一个意念。

“带我归你，把我囚禁，因为我接受你；又投掷我——否则我永不会自由，也永不会贞洁，除非你夺取我。”

让我们向君王祷告。让我们祷告：

我们的父啊，我们感谢你，因为你以这样的方式来到我们这里：为要赢得而寻求推翻；为要扶我们进入得胜而寻求击败我们。求你帮助我们看见你的心意，帮助在座每一个人看见你对他或她的心意。我们生命中此刻正在发生一些事，若不透过《哥林多后书》第十章这段经文来看我们自己，就无法明白。我们求你借着圣灵，使我们能把这些应用出来。我们奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。

你听过吗？约翰·多恩（John Donne）那首诗《击打我的心》（“Batter my heart”）：

“击打我的心，三一的上帝；
因为你至今只是敲门、吹拂、照耀，想要修补。
但愿我能起来、站立——推翻我，并折弯我；
用你的力量来打破、击打、焚烧，使我成为新的。

我，像一座被篡夺的城，属于另一个人；
我辛劳想让你进入，却徒劳无功。
理性，你在我里面的副王，本该护卫我，
却被俘虏，显得软弱、不真实。

然而我深深爱你，也愿被你所爱；
可我却已许配给你的仇敌。
所以求你与我离婚，解开——或再一次打断那结；
带我归你，把我囚禁，因为我接受你；又投掷我——
否则我永不会自由，也永不会贞洁，除非你夺取我。”

是的，征服我。愿意让他拆毁你那些“高高的事物”。愿意去思想。

还有，基督徒朋友们，我再对你们说一件事：听着——你可能会说：“我已经把自己交给基督了，他是我的主和救主。”可是，你的每一个意念都被掳去了吗？承认这一点真的很难。

认知疗法的治疗师多少也在做这件事，只是他们不把基督教的内容放进去。他们是这样说的：你抑郁吗？你焦虑吗？你痛苦吗？看看你在对自己说些什么——正是那些话引发了那种情绪。总有一个更深处的念头，在下面。

你知道，你知道——比如说，有一个人：同样的事情发生在 A 太太身上，也发生在……

B，然而 A 太太却还好，B 太太却陷入抑郁。为什么？使 A 太太和 B 太太抑郁或安然无恙的，并不是处境本身；而是 A 太太和 B 太太在对自己说什么——正是她们对自己说的话使她们陷入抑郁。你知道，如果有不好的事发生在 B 太太身上，而她对自己说：“看吧，就像我父亲说的那样，我永远都不会有出息。”她就会抑郁；如果同样的事发生在 A 太太身上，而 A 太太却对自己说：“正如我的主耶稣对我所说的：‘你的心若责备你，神比你的心大。’”——换句话说，如果你抑郁，就去找出最底层的那个念头；如果你愤怒，就去找出最底层的那个念头；如果你焦虑，就去找出最底层的那个念头，然后把它交给耶稣去俘获，让他把它丢出去，把他的真理放进去——你的问题就在这里。

把每一个意念都掳来，使它顺服你，把我带到你那里，囚禁我，因为我接纳你；把我抛向你，我永不再得自由，也永不再被追逐，除非你夺取我、征服我。让我们向这位君王祷告，让我们祷告：我们的天父，我们感谢你，因为你以这样的方式来到我们中间——你寻求推翻，是为了赢得；你寻求击败我们，是为了把我们带入得胜。求你帮助我们看见你的设计是什么，也帮助在座每一个人看见你对他或她的设计是什么。我们此刻生命里正在发生的一些事，只有当我们借着《哥林多后书》第十章这段经文来看待自己时，才会明白。我们求你藉着圣灵，使我们能够把这信息应用出来。我们奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。
