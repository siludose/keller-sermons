today's podcast where Tim Keller explores the person and promises of Jesus Christ.  2 Corinthians 10, 1-6. This is Paul speaking. By the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I appeal to you, I, Paul, who am timid when  face to face with you, but bold went away. I beg you that when I come I may not have to be as bold as I expect to be toward some  people who think that we live by the standards of this world. For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does.

The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world, on the contrary. They have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments in every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of  God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ. And we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience once your obedience is complete. And this is God's word.

We've been talking about Jesus as prophet, priest, and king. There's a place in Matthew 12 where Jesus says, the men of Nineveh will stand up in judgment  and condemn this generation. For they repented at the preaching of Jonah and behold a greater than Jonah is here. And the queen of the south will rise up on the judgment day and condemn this generation  for she came from the ends of the earth to Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon  is here. That's a very dramatic statement.

And you see what he's saying? He is saying, a greater than Jonah, I'm the ultimate prophet, a greater than Aaron or  Moses on the ultimate priest, a greater than Solomon on the ultimate king. That's quite a challenge, and that's quite a claim. But what we're going to look at here tonight is what does that mean? Now it shouldn't come of surprise to you that historically Christians and people who  have studied the Bible have seen that Jesus Christ executes his office.

That means he carries out his office of king in two different ways. He carries it out spiritually in the hearts of his people and he carries it out cosmically  in history. And we're not going to talk about the second ones tonight. We're going to talk about the first one. Because what we have here is an interesting description of how Jesus Christ approaches  the human heart.

What does it say? It says, though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does. The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world in the contrary. They have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments and every pretension it sets itself up against the knowledge of  God and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.

What is this describing? First of all, what is describing implicitly and then secondly, what is describing explicitly? Implicitly, tacitly, in other words, it's unstated but completely assumed and therefore  taught in the passage that Jesus Christ is king. And the reason we say Jesus Christ is king is because it says every thought has to be obedient  to Christ. Every thought.

My neighbor comes to me and asks me for a cup of sugar. And if I say no to my neighbor, I may be unkind, I may be rude, I may be uncompassionate,  I may be a bad neighbor but I'm not disobedient. You're only disobedient if you owe something to somebody, if that person has some rights  over you. And the fact that every thought, not just part but every thought of my life and my heart,  every dimension therefore of my being has to be made obedient to Christ means he's my absolute  monarch. So for example, I may have to be obedient to the police officer, why?

Well, it's part of what it means to be a citizen of the city. The police officer asked me to do something and I should obey because in a certain narrow  focus or scope, in a certain narrow scope, the police officer has rights over me. Now, it's all part of the social contract, it's all part of what it means when I decide  to live in a place like New York City and when I become a citizen of the United States  and when I elect representatives and they appoint this and they appoint that, the police officer  cannot tell me who to marry. At that point, the police officer is making a suggestion. The police officer says, I want you to marry my sister-in-law or I'm going to give you  a ticket.

You can't do that. He's got a scope. He says, you must do this when you get to that stop sign or I'm going to run you in. He has the right to do that. He has rights over me.

So there is a part of my life in which I have to obey the police officer and then of  course you can talk about all sorts of relationships we have in which we owe things to people. A person who's done a great deed for you, a good friend. And very often, if that person is sacrificed for you and you know that that person has done  something for you, you sense a certain moral authority that that person has over you. You don't have to spell it out. You don't have to think it out.

You just recognize a moral authority. And you know therefore that if that person who has, let's just say, a person who gave  you enough money to stay in school, that last semester, so you could graduate. So you were able to make it through college. If a person like that comes to you and asks for a cup of sugar and you say no, you probably  are in a sense being disobedient because you realize that a small request like that from  a person like that is is disobedient because that person has some kind of moral right over  you. So when we talk about obedience, we mean the person we owe some kind of authority to, some  kind of deference to.

In this case, we have an unparalleled claim. It doesn't just say that Jesus Christ wants you, wants you on Sunday or Jesus Christ just  wants your will. He wants you to obey the Ten Commandments. It says Jesus Christ is demanding the captivity of every thought. That means his authority and his moral authority over you is absolute.

Well, where does the Bible come off saying that? And it comes off this way and think about the logic of it and it's overwhelming logic,  I think. Were you created or are you an accident? There's really nothing in the middle, you know? Did someone or something with intelligence, rationality, something with a purpose create  you?

If not, you are an accident and you know we sometimes spend time on this, I won't spend  much time on this, but just think it out. Then we see a lump of lead that fell off of the, out of the sleuths in the factory which  is taking lead and turning it into this or that part. And if a piece falls off, molten lead and it falls to the floor and it just forms some  kind of arbitrarily formed puddle, and then it hardens, what do we call that? It's an accident. You don't look at that thing and say, what's it for?

Can you break it? By the way, if you pick it up and it sort of squished and all like this and then you break  it over your leg and it falls into two pieces, you don't say, oh, you broke it. You don't say that because it was already broke because it had no purpose. It wasn't useful. You might be able to use it as a door stop or something like that, but you see it wasn't  created for a purpose.

So it's an accident. So there's no way to violate it and there's no way to break it and has no purpose. For you, you, the result of the blind collision of forces. Are you an accident? Are you an accident of evolution?

Are you an accident of chemical reactions? Are you an accident? In that case, there is no purpose for you. There's no right or wrong for you. There's no intention for your life.

There's no meaning for your life. There's no way for you to be broken. You may feel I'm depressed. There's something wrong. If you aren't created, how are you to say what's wrong?

That's wrong. Whatever is is. Nobody likes to live with that, nobody likes to believe that, and also nobody really  does believe that because you sense that there is something about me that is of design. So most of us want to say I was created. I'm not an accident, but if you were created, what rights would your creator have over  you?

Think of it this way. What if you had poured tremendous amount of energy, creative energy, all of your  talents into a song? It's the best song you ever wrote, okay, you musicians. And before you have a chance to copyright it, somebody picks it up, sells it him or herself,  gets the credit for it, and makes a zillion dollars. How would you feel?

Now because you were so maybe dumb as to not get a copyrighted, there's no way that you  can really, legally, say, that's mine. You can't prove it. But the person did was perfectly legal. Yet you would feel I have moral rights, I have moral rights over that song. Why?

If it wasn't for me, it wouldn't exist. And the one using it couldn't have produced it. Now this is all intuitive. We all know this. There's nobody in this room who would not experience that the same way.

You see, if it wasn't for me, it wouldn't exist. And the one using it couldn't have produced it and therefore should, I have moral rights. I have more rights. Not saying I don't want anybody else to enjoy the song, I'm not saying I don't want anybody  else to use the song. But I should have the ultimate moral rights over that thing.

Or the same thing would happen if you invented a new fuel injection apparatus for an automobile  in your basement so that the car that uses it would get 300 miles to a gallon. Somebody else comes along and takes it. Starts using it. How would you feel? You have moral rights over that.

If it wasn't for me, it wouldn't exist. Now, what if, and plenty of you do, and plenty of us do, and all of us do, at a certain  point, before we get converted into Christianity, what if you decide, I alone have the right  to decide what to do with my body, what to do with my sexuality, what to do with my talent,  how to spend my money, how to use my time, I and I alone. Did you produce that talent? Whether you're an accident, or you've been created, in which case, that creator, if we could  find them, if we could communicate with them, if there's a creator, has ultimate moral rights  over you, and for you to be going off and taking the things, the things that have risen  out of resources that you did not generate, you couldn't have produced, and using them  for your own profit, without deference to him, without saying, what do you want me to do  with my money, what do you want me to do with my talent, what do you want me to do with my  brain, what do you want me to do with my sexuality, just as bad, or worse, because let me tell  you, the creative energy that goes into a song is great as that it is nothing like the  creative energy that goes into a human being. Every thought, every moment, every dimension of your life belongs to the one who created  it, without which, without whom, excuse me, without whom, none of this would exist, none  of you would exist, no part of you would exist, see?

Therefore, when the Bible says, every thought, every one of your thoughts belongs to Jesus,  it is assuming that this is the one who created you, and let me tell you one thing, there  really isn't much in between. You can either say, I'm an accident, and therefore I can do anything I want, but you have to live  with the consequences of the fact there's no right and wrong, if to live with the consequence  of the fact there is no meaning except that which you manufacture, if to live with all that,  or else you have to say, I owe my creator every single thought, every dimension, not just  Sunday's, not just a tip of the hat, everything, absolute, rightful king, and before we move  on, let me just appeal to you, I want you all to know that most of you are Americans, and  even those of you who aren't from America have maybe been here long enough to sort of  imbibe the American, Western, individualistic culture, and I want you to know and be aware  and be completely cognizant of how prejudiced you are against this whole idea. When you come to the Bible, and when you come to the Christian message, you have to realize  what a filter you have over your mind, and you're screening out an awful lot of the absolute  natures of the claims of Christ and the message of Christianity, because John Guest is an  Episcopalian pastor who has been in America for a long time, but he came here in his 20s  from Britain, he was an Anglican minister, and years ago I heard him give a talk, and  I don't know if he mentions this illustration anymore, maybe you heard it, if you know him  or heard him before, he, when he first came to this country he said he was struck, because  he went to a some historic site, and he was going into a place that was a revolutionary  war era tavern, that had been preserved the way it was in America during the Revolutionary War,  this must have been either filled out for your Boston I think, and he went in and he saw the tavern,  and he noticed it was a sign from the era, up, over the tables, and it said we serve no sovereigns  here, you know, kind of American in your face, we don't have kings here, we've got presidents,  they do what we want, if they don't do what most a 51% of us want, they're out of there,  we don't have kings, we serve no sovereigns here, and John Guest said he suddenly realized he  was in a different culture, he said you know, he says in Europe we're secular people, I said you  know we're not this wonderful, we're not wonderfully moral people, he says but I tell you at least  we still have some positive memories of bowing the need to a sovereign, we at least have some  positive vibrations about that, people from the East, Asians very often also come from a situation  in which at least the positive benefits of authority and submission are held up, but when you come  to America, you come to one place where that notion, the notion of a king is anathema, the notion  of a king is really repugnant, it's very much a part of who we are, it's very deep in us,  there is no higher authority than my individual conscience, and every single person who's been  in America for very long, that is so much a part of us that nobody, no Americans ever come to  these kinds of passages and this kind of teaching objective, you're not objective, you are not open  minded when it comes to these things, you hate the idea, we'll get into why I admit, but you have  to see that, but what do you do about it? What do you do about it is this, it's a great place, and I  can't quote it exactly, but it's really sunk into my memory, in a book, which is probably at the  book table or it ought to be, or we'll be soon, right David, because I'm mentioning it, so you'll  be run with it, a Becky Pippert wrote a book called Out of the Salt Shaker, which is really a book  on how to share what Christ has done for you with other people, there's this one wonderful section  in which she says, just remember, when people say they want to be free and they don't want to have  to submit to a king, just remind them that everybody's got a king, everybody's got a lord, and she says  something like this, she says, those who seek power, those who seek power, that's the thing you're  seeking, then you're serving power, power is mastering and ruling you, it's really what drives you,  if you want approval in life, then you will be mastered, you see, ruled by image, or what people  think of you, if you want money, then you will be ruled by money, if you say, ah listen, if you say,  I don't, I don't submit to anybody, I belong to myself, then you're ruled by independence,  you're the kind of person that has to do things, you have to do things, just to show that you don't  owe anybody anything, and if you have to show that you don't owe anybody anything, to show that  you owe nothing to anybody, that nothing rules you, you're ruled by your own independence,  or no matter what, something is your lord, something is your king, you don't belong to yourself,  so you have to realize the Christianity is not saying, you over here, you're free, you know,  you don't serve anything but yourself, come and be captive to Christ, no Christianity, the offer of  Christianity is this, you're a captive to something, your thoughts are captive to something, you know  they are, the things that you feel like you've got to have, your thoughts are captive, you do not  belong to yourself, and so the Christian message is, stop being ruled by things that tyrannize you and  start being ruled by the one king that won't tyrannize you because he is your rightful king,  he's the one that knows how you run, he's the one that knows who you are,  and therefore you don't go from freedom to slavery to become a Christian, you go from slavery to  freedom, because freedom is not a lack of a master, freedom is not the lack of a king but it's  finding a true king for everybody's got one, no one is his or her own, so secondly, first we saw  that this is implicit, Jesus is the king, every single part of you must be obedient to him,  that's the implicit, but then explicitly it tells us how he exercises this kingship in our lives,  and you know how he does it? This is very, very bold and also really neat, he is a conqueror,  that means the way Jesus Christ exercises his kingship in our lives is he sees us as having captured  a heart that belongs to himself, some other things are ruling in there, and therefore Paul says  what Jesus does as a king is he comes and besieges your heart, the way a king would besiege  his capital, that his now fallen under enemy hands, and this is something that Jesus does  and unless you understand that this is the way in which he works, this is how he exercises his  kingship, a lot of you are not going to be able to understand what's going on in your life right  now, right now you may be under siege, there may be divine weapons being shot at you,  see you may be finding that arguments and pretensions are being demolished by some kind of spiritual  weaponry, this is what Jesus does to the human heart, this is how he comes, he comes as a conquering  but let's see what the features of this, the features are, first this work is not a violent work  in a sense of being physically violent or it's not a coercive violence at all, instead the kind  of conquering that Jesus does is he seeks to win your heart and that literally means he seeks to  get you to fall in love with him, that's the conquest, you know we have some predilection to  talk this way when it comes to romance, you know we do talk a little bit about that, we talk like that  sometimes, some of the love poetry says you've conquered me, all right I you know I didn't know  who you were, I didn't really like you at first and yet I've been won by you, you see you've captured  my heart, we use that sometimes in sort of drippy hyperbolic ways you know when we talk about what's  happened to us when we fall in love but Jesus actually is using that terminology almost literally,  look first of all his conquering work is full of gentleness and meekness in the very first verse  Paul who's about to tell us that he is in Jesus army he's a preacher and he's a church planter  and he says I am coming after you but not with my weapons, with divine weapons, in other words  Paul is saying that with the way when he preaches the gospel when he persuades people to turn to  Christ he is actually in Christ's army and therefore he's participating in this kingly conquering  campaign that Jesus does when he besieges the human heart and that's what we see here but look  he starts off talking about this warfare and this conquest by saying by the meekness and gentleness  of Christ I appeal to you so we see that this conqueror is meek and gentle and he's after what  your thoughts he's after your motives in other words he is not trying to get you to be  coerced he's not trying to get you to be a begrudging slave he's not trying to force you to do  thump something that you don't want to he wants to capture your heart he wants to soften your heart  he wants your thoughts see to get your thoughts is to is to get you to see the delight that he is  to see the love that he is to see the freedom that he is and he does it with meekness and gentleness  look for example let me give you a great example of this Psalm 119 a very very long Psalm  I would take you week to read it usually it's it's not a typical Psalm it's got it's very very long  but there's a section of it in fact I could read you any section to show you an example of a conquered  heart but let me read you just a section out of out of it verse 97 and so on right around there  and the Psalmist says behold how I love your law I meditate on it all day long your commands make  me wiser than my enemies further ever with me I have more understanding than my elders for I obey  your precepts I have kept my feet from every evil path that I might obey your word how sweet  are your words to my taste sweeter than honey to my mouth I gain understanding from them therefore  I hate every wrong path now that is the language of a conquered heart that's not the language of  a person who was just raised moral you know people who are raised moral a lot of you were raised  in kind of conservative churches and raised not necessarily Christian churches conservative homes  and conservative backgrounds and when you have a quiet time when you sit down and study the bible  and pray you say I feel better I feel better but you don't feel close to God you just have some  relief in your conscience you're afraid you may know the story of the prodigal son  but it's not just about a wayward younger brother in fact Jesus tells this story to speak both to  those who run from God and to those who try to earn his love by being good in his book the  prodigal God Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart of the gospel a message of  hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental older brother and an invitation  for all to experience God's prodigal extravagant grace whether you're a Christian or you're still  exploring faith the prodigal God will help you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way  the prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the  hope and joy of Christ gracious and relentless love with people all over the world request your  copy today at gospel and life dot com slash give that's gospel and life dot com slash give now  here's doctor Keller with the rest of today's teaching I've had a lot of people tell me and I  know I'm I'm in danger of throwing out here a you know a subject that I'm not going to be able to  get back to and some preaching professor years ago said to me never you know raise more snakes than  you can kill when you're sermon if you raise a snake make sure you have time to kill it I don't  can't do this one but some of you know that one of the things that we say here at the Bible teaches  is that once you become a Christian now there is no condemnation for those who were in Christ Jesus  but once you truly are united to the Father through the Son there's no way that your sins can  bring you ever back into a state of condemnation you're in ah well people say I'm glad I don't  believe will you believe I don't believe that I say what I said well if if I knew  that no matter what I did once I became a Christian there would be no condemnation for me  what a temptation that would be I said well explain that to me how would that be a temptation  say well I wouldn't have any incentive to live a moral life and I would say okay let me get  this straight you're saying that if you would no longer be afraid of God no longer be afraid of his  wrath no longer be afraid of his punishment no longer be afraid of him coming and getting you that  you would lose all your incentive to live a moral life okay let me get this straight all your incentive  is fear all of your incentive is negative and a lot of people who think their Christians  have nothing but a negative morality they come to church because if they don't come to church  they're conscience bothers and that's fine for a start that's a fine way to get on the path  to real Christianity but that's all it is there's people who who are very careful in their business  life to be straight arrows and everybody around them says oh yeah she he yeah very much is straight  out very moral you know don't don't use that kind of language around her don't do this around him  you know don't get them in on a deal like that you know they're pretty straight arrows they wouldn't  like it and so forth and you know that you have that reputation feel pretty good about it it could  all be fear your heart your thoughts your motives never conquered the reason that your moral is  frickly because it's been inculcated in you since you were little you just you know it's very powerful  to be told as a little kid don't do that never do that God will get you if that happens to you  you know you don't lose that over the years and that's fine for a start it is fine for a start  but that's not Christianity Jesus is not after that he's after something far far more  deep than that the psalmist when you read Psalm 119 you'll see for example the psalmist does not see  the Bible he's talking about by law he doesn't see the Bible is strictly a set of nice  he doesn't see it as a book of virtues for example he doesn't see it as a set  of esophs fables with morals at the end of it he calls the word of God he calls the Bible  thy precepts thy commands you see I meditate on them I love them he knows that their words of the  king he knows he has to obey them but look what he says he says they give me insight they make me  great I there's one place where he says I pant after your commands what's going on here  his heart's been captured the big big difference between a Christian and a moral person Paul says  in 2 Corinthians 3 you know you're really a Christian when the law is written on your heart not  just on your conscience when you find in your in most self that the law got a sweet you know in  Psalm 1 it tells you the mark of a godly person it doesn't say godly person praise day and night  though hopefully he or she will doesn't say that the godly person witnesses on the street  corners day and night though of course I hope he will or she will I it doesn't say that that person  goes to church every time the doors are open though I hope you know he or she will attend church  regularly now you can do all that out of fear you know do all that without a heart that's been  captured by the king with your thoughts not captive just your will now what is saying someone it says  for he that's the godly man the lights in the law of God and upon it he meditates day and night  he doesn't just read it and say I got to do it I better do it I better get to know it he meditates  he chews on it he gets the sweetness out of it he loves to see it because he senses that the more  he takes it in the more he's becoming something great he says I have more insight than my elders I  love what this does for me think of it like this what if what if you were a gymnast what if you  were a gymnast let's say you're a young girl but you're now you know you've never quite hit your  peak you what at least you never hit what you think you should be able to do you haven't made it  and how you're starting to get a little old in for your career ever to really be good and you're  kind of frightened and somebody says let's let's take you to a really good coach I know of a good  coach and the coach comes and the coach really starts to rigorously give you a lot of hard exercise  and a lot of hard rules and all that but you begin to soar you begin to win and you begin to jump  higher than you ever have and you begin to your body begins to do things that you never could do  before you're flying because you're obeying and how would you look at the commands of your coach  they'd be sweeter than honey to you you'd pant after them you say more more because I see what  it's doing to me it's it's making me great has that happened to you ever see that's a very big part  of what what Jesus does when he conquers your heart he brings it captive now how does he do it  and the answer is good kings or I should say good generals if they're besieging a city don't just  say to their their armies charge you know when and wherever you want you know a fire will instead  a good king decides where they're going to attack on the wall and we have here two places that  we're told that Jesus attacks it says what it says verse five now don't forget Paul is talking  about we he's part of the army he's part of the thing but he's talking about Jesus campaign  and he says with these with these weapons of divine power we demolish arguments and every  pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God there's two things arguments and  pretensions I'll try to be brief on this because even though each of these would be it would be great  to go in the word arguments means just what it looks like rational arguments the word pretensions  literally means high things proud things that's why that's not a bad it's not a bad you know some of  these words are very hard to translate and the translators when they're sitting there trying to  figure out the best word I know they must agonize that's not bad pretension to pretend means  to try to to to be something that you're not and what this is telling us is there's two ways in  which the king comes after you to win your heart one is more intellectual and one is personal let's  just look at these two things for a minute the first thing is he comes after arguments a lot of  modern people don't want to hear this but let me just explain what that means the Bible tells us  that everybody has faith one of the things is so irritating for a thoughtful Christian when  talking to people who don't believe Christianity is they say well you know if you could prove God  to me I could believe but you can't and the implication is I'm a skeptical person you see I'm  skeptical and I only believe what can be proved and if you're the faith the kind of person has  faith fine you can't prove what you what you believe and if you could prove it to me then I  would be very happy to to believe it's irritating because the assumption is I as a Christian have faith  and it's sort of based on you know nothing and you don't have faith but that's not true the Bible  says at the bottom of every single human being are arguments at the bottom of everyone are arguments  you cannot make a move I gotta make sure I do this concisely and don't go off for 10 minutes  I don't have time for that but you cannot make a choice you could for example just give a quick  example let's just say all of your life you're taught don't have sex apart from marriage you know  you were taught that out in Missouri but then you moved to New York and you come to New York  and hear everybody thinks that only very odd strange people you know would adhere to that  and so you start to feel attracted to somebody who obviously wants to have sex with you and you  decide what you're gonna do it or not do you realize you can't make a decision about that unless  your decision assumes either that the universe is ultimate that there is a creator god that he has  spoken that he's got rules or that there's not if you decide to sleep with a girl or the guy  why well you know intellectually you might not want to work at all out you don't want to work it out  you don't want to think it out but what you've actually done is you've bought the argument that  well there may not be a god but if there is a god we can't know what he teaches right aren't you  assuming that there might be a god but if there is a god we can't know that he said anything about  sexuality that is a religious assumption that is that's an axiom and you're basing your life on it  you can't prove it anymore than I can prove it so you can't prove it's wrong anymore than I can  prove it's right but don't you see what that means you are basing your life and you were  practice on an axiom that is an axiom of faith and you are betting your destiny on it  so when somebody says to me you can't prove god I say you can't prove there isn't god  and even though this doesn't go too far but at least it gets after people at one certain level  you can't prove that there isn't god and yet you're betting your life that there isn't  I can't prove that there is a god and I'm betting my life that there is now we can talk once  you're willing to admit that we both have faith and there were both betting and wagering our lives  on our faith assumptions and we're both deeply religious because science can't tell you what there's  a god or whether there isn't science can't tell you all these things now what Paul is getting at  and what the Bible gets at and there's another other places where it talks about this is that there  are arguments there are rational belief structures there are all there's a matrix of these faith  assumptions underneath you and everybody no matter what you say about what where you stand with  Christianity you've got a belief system you've got a matrix of these things you've got arguments  that you're basing your life on the average non-Christian doesn't want to look at those things  you don't want to look at them my sister-in-law some years ago had an interesting experience where she  was at med school and and they were part she was part of an internship and they were doing the  rounds all the other students were talking about a particular patient they said you know be better  just to turn it all off and let the let the lady die because she's suffering and once she's dead she  won't suffer and sometimes suicide is better because at least when when you're dead you're not  suffering and my sister-in-law looked at them and said can you prove that how do you know that these  people aren't going to hell now she said I'm not trying to argue right now that there is a hell  but I'm trying to show you that your medical decision is assuming there's not well they say well  you know there's no proof well there's no proof that there's not there is no way that you can make  a move without all sorts of religious assumptions that's all I'm trying to say I'm not trying to prove  the Christianity's right I'm not even saying please don't anybody get the impression that I'm saying  that there's no way to show that one set of assumptions is better than another actually that's  the whole point Paul says Jesus Christ will always come and show you your faith assumptions and show  you that they're inferior that they don't explain reality like Christianity does that you can't  really live consistently with them but the point is that Jesus Christ will always in order to win your  heart make you think and I have people all the time coming to me and saying I've got problems in  my life and I just want to connect with God they don't want to think is the Bible true or not well  you know they like their argument that means they like their intellectual construct that allows  them to say who knows but that's a faith assumption they don't want to have to examine it why because  they want to be able to leave things out of the Bible they think that are primitive they don't like  to think that maybe Jesus is the only way to God they think that you know they've got a modern  construct that says all religions are ways to God how do they know that they don't know that it's  a set of arguments they haven't thought it out they haven't thought out if that's logical if it's  possible they don't want to think about that they want peace they want to connect with Jesus they want  to walk by a river side and see the beauty of the Grand Canyon and they just want God to be real to  them so they can handle their lives he never does that without demolishing arguments  he never does that without making you think you see Christianity is based on hard truth objective  truth propositional truth it's true or it's not true but to reject it takes a lot of thinking  as well as to accept it and to reject it takes a faith commitment as well as to accept it and people  aren't even willing to do that Jesus will not deal with you without making you think  all people get very upset about this they don't want to have to think  but he will always come in by demolishing arguments he'll show you there's a rational basis  for what the Bible teaches there's a reason for the hope Christianity is full of truth claims they'll  make you think there's no way to get his peace there's no way for him to capture your heart he'll  always make you think but then on the other hand there's pretensions and you see underneath all the  intellectual objections to the to the kingship of Christ our moral objections pretensions literally  means high things that ultimately Paul was saying that besides the arguments and in some ways the  strength of the arguments is our pride we don't we say we can't believe that's the arguments  because we don't want to obey and that's the pretension pretension means self will the other day  I had the experience of telling a 10 year old boy that his mother needed him he was in a bad  mood and he stood up and he looked at me and he said she always needs me and when I go to her she  asks me to do things that I hate he was furious he was just in a bad mood he was playing a video game  didn't want to go now see I was and I thought about this I said you know that's the way children are  all demands are unreasonable as far as a child's concern all demands are unreasonable I want to do  what I want to do I don't want anybody telling me what to do every time I go to see my mother she has  me to do things I don't feel like doing that's deep that's very deep and you don't think that when  you start to approach God it's gonna go off and therefore there is something in us very deeply  rooted that you have to admit I hope you see it that that keeps you from really being objective when  it comes to Christianity you say I cannot put myself in a place where I am not am out of control I  know what I want no one should have the right to tell me what to do and therefore when the king seeks  to conquer your heart on the one hand he has arguments and he comes after you and he makes you think  but on the other hand he's got to do something about your pride and therefore he puts out all kinds  of humbling conditions and humbling circumstances and things that bring you to the end of your own  resources this to me is a very very very practical verse it's telling me how almost everybody I know has  ever found Christ conquering their heart and getting them getting getting you to love him it's never  just humbling you without arguments or just arguing you without humbling it's always the two together  unless something happens to show you that you do not have what it takes you're not competent to  run your own life unless he does something about your high things you're just never going to come to  him but on the other hand if you think he's going to come to you and you're going to come to him  without thinking just having some kind of mystical experience it won't work either they both come  together they have to come together and now let me conclude this way first of all to those of you  who've really never given yourself to him just think about this you are in a position where you are  going to have to be willing to see that some of the humbling things that are happening to you  maybe because the king is trying to get you to love him he's dealing with your high things  instead of saying why is he doing this to me he's meek and gentle remember that's the first where  he's very meek and gentle but he will do what it takes it'll hurt him it says in lamentations three  he does not willingly afflict the sons of men oh notice what it says he doesn't like it  doesn't say he doesn't do it he says he doesn't willingly do it he doesn't like to do it he's  meek and gentle a bruised reedy will not break it says in Matthew 12 a smoking flaxi will not quench  till he brings forth judgment to victory but he'll do it and if you resist him don't tempt him  because he will do what it takes to bring down your high things because he loves you  or on the other hand you're going to have to start thinking you're going to have to start reading  you have to start studying you have to go to classes you're going to have to study the Bible you  have to talk to other people you're not going to ever get yourself to Christ through a misal  experience you have to decide can I accept the Christian faith can I accept the teachings of  the Christian faith they've got to happen that could be what needs to be done right now humble yourself  under his mighty hand and he will exalt you in due time you know a perfect perfect in fact I don't  know if he did it but John Dunn has his wonderful son at that he wrote and it's it's so much a great  summarizing of this passage that it's hard not to think that he had it in my didn't have it in my  when he wrote it you've heard it John Dunn batter my heart three person God for you as yet but  knock breeze shine and seek to mend but I may rise stand overthrow me and bend your force to  break blow burn and make me new hear that that I may rise and stand or throw me and bend your  force to break blow burn and make me new high things I like a usurp town to another do labor to  admit you but oh to no end reason your vice Roy and me me should defend but is captivated and  proves weak and untrue yet dearly I love you and would be loved feign but I'm betrothed unto  your enemy so divorce me on tire break that knot again take me to you imprison me for I accept you  and throw me never shall be free or ever chased except you ravish me yeah conquer me be willing to  let him bring down your high things be willing to think and Christian friends one more thing to you  guys listen you know you say well I've given myself to Christ he's my Lord and Savior but is  every thought captive it's really tough to admit this the cognitive therapies therapists are sort  of into it but they don't put Christian content and it's it goes like this are you depressed  are you anxious are you better look at what you're telling yourself that causes that emotion there's  always a thought down there you know you know here's here's a person who's the same thing happens to  Mrs.

A and Mrs. B and yet Mrs. A is okay Mrs. B gets depressed why it's not the circumstance that  makes Mrs. A and B depressed are okay it's what Mrs.

A and B is saying to themselves what they're  saying to themselves that makes them depressed you know it's something bad happens to Mrs. B and she  says yet just like my father said I'll never amount to hillabines she'll be depressed and if Mrs. A the  same thing happens Mrs. A but she says to herself as my my Lord Jesus is said to me  though your heart condemning God is greater than your heart in other words if you're depressed find  the thought at the bottom if you're angry find the thought at the bottom if you're anxious find  the thought at the bottom and get it captured by Jesus let him throw it out put his truth in there  that's your problem let him capture every thought  take me to you imprison me for I accept you and throw me never shall be free nor ever chased  unless you ravish me let's pray to the king let's pray our father we thank you that because you have  come to us the way you have seeking to overthrow in order to win seeking to defeat us in order to  lift us to victory help us to see what your your design is and help every person here to see what  your design is for him or her there's things going on in our lives right now that will only be  understood if we see ourselves through this text in 2nd Corinthians 10 we ask that you would make  it possible for us apply this by your Holy Spirit we pray in Jesus name amen you heard it  John done batter my heart three person God for you as yet but knock breeze shine and seek to mend  but I may rise stand over throw me and bend your force to break blow burn and make me new  hear that that I may rise and stand over throw me and bend your force to break blow burn and  make me new hi things I like a usurped town to another do labor to admit you but oh to no end  reason your vice Roy and me me should defend but is captivated and proves weak and untrue  yet dearly I love you and would be loved faint but I'm betrothed unto your enemy  so divorce me on tie or break that knot again take me to you imprison me for I accept you and throw me never  shall be free or ever chased except you ravish me yeah conquer me be willing to let him bring down  your high things be willing to think and Christian friends one more thing to you guys listen  you know you say well I've given myself to Christ I he's my lord and savior but is every thought captive  it's really tough to admit this the cognitive therapies therapists are sort of into it but they  don't put Christian content in it it goes like this are you depressed are you anxious are you  better look at what you're telling yourself that causes that emotion there's always a thought down  you know you know here's here's a person who's the same thing happens to Mrs. A and Mrs.

### 引言：耶稣是谁？

耶稣是谁？圣经说他是完全的神，是宇宙的创造者，同时也是完全的人。失去其中之一，你就失去了基督教。加入我们今天的播客，蒂姆·凯勒将探讨耶稣基督的人物和应许。哥林多后书 10:1-6。

> “我保罗，就是那在你们中间见面时是谦卑的，不在你们那里的时候向你们是勇敢的，借着基督的温柔和慈爱劝你们。”

**因为我们虽然在肉身中行事，却不凭着肉身争战。**

### 耶稣作为先知、祭司和君王

我们一直在谈论耶稣作为先知、祭司和君王。在马太福音12章中，耶稣说，尼尼微人要在审判的时候起来定这世代的罪，因为他们听了约拿所传的就悔改了，看哪，这里有一人比约拿更大。

> “南方的女王要在审判的时候起来定这世代的罪，因为她从地极而来，要听所罗门的智慧，看哪，这里有一人比所罗门更大。”

**这是一个很大的挑战，也是一个很大的宣称。**

### 耶稣在我们心中的王权

历史上，基督徒和研究圣经的人都看到耶稣基督执行他的职分。这意味着他以两种不同的方式履行他的王权。他在他子民的心中属灵地履行王权，并在历史上宇宙性地履行王权。

> “我们争战的兵器本不是属血气的，乃是在神面前有能力，可以攻破坚固的营垒。”

**每一个思想都必须顺服基督。**

### 论点和自负

隐含地，默示地，换句话说，虽然没有明说，但完全假定并因此在经文中教导耶稣基督是王。我们说耶稣基督是王的原因是因为它说每一个思想都必须顺服基督。

- 论点：理性的信仰结构
- 自负：高傲的事物

### 结论：俘获每一个思想

保罗说，耶稣基督总是会来向你展示你的信仰假设，并向你展示它们是低劣的。**他总是让你思考。**

> “带我到你那里囚禁我，因为我接受你，除非你征服我，否则我永远不会自由或纯洁。”

让我们向王祈祷。

> “我们的父，我们感谢你，因为你以这样的方式来到我们这里，寻求推翻以赢得胜利，寻求击败我们以提升我们到胜利。”

**帮助我们看到你对他或她的设计。**
