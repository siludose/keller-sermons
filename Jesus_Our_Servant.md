## English Transcript / 英文原文

today's podcast where Tim Keller explores the person and promises of Jesus  Christ. A reading from Psalm 69. Save me, O God, for the waters have come up to my neck. I sink in the myoree depths where there is no foothold. I have come into the deep waters, the floods engulf me.

I am worn out calling for help. My throat is parched. My eyes fail looking for my God. Those who hate me without reason outnumber the hairs of my head. Many are my enemies without cause.

Those who seek to destroy me. I am forced to restore what I did not steal. You know my folly, O God. My guilt is not hidden from you. May those who open you not be disgraced because of me, O Lord, the Lord Almighty.

May those who seek you not be put to shame because of me, O God of Israel. For I endure scorn for your sake and shame covers my face. I am a stranger to my brothers and alien to my own mother's sons, for zeal for your  house consumes me and the insults of those who insult you fall on me. When I weep and fast, I must endure scorn. When I put on sackcloth, people make sport of me.

Those who sit at the gate mock me and I am the song of the drunkards. But I pray to you, O Lord, in the time of your favor, in your great love, O God, answer  me with your sure salvation. Rescue me from the mire. Do not let me sink. Deliver me from those who hate me from the deep waters.

Do not let the floodwaters engulf me or the depths swallow me up or the pit close its  mouth over me. Answer me, O Lord, out of the goodness of your love in your great mercy turned to me. Do not hide your face from your servant. Answer me quickly for I am in trouble. Come near and rescue me.

Redeem me because of my foes. You know how I am scorned, disgraced and shamed. All my enemies are before you. God has broken my heart and has left me helpless. I looked for sympathy, but there was none, for comfortors, but I found none.

They put gall in my food and gave me vinegar for my thirst. May the table set before them become a snare. May it become retribution and a trap. May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see and their backs be bent forever. Pour out your wrath on them, let your fierce anger overtake them.

May their place be deserted, let there be no one to dwell in their tents. For they persecute those you wound and talk about the pain of those you hurt. Charge them with crime upon crime. Do not let them share in your salvation. May they be blotted out of the book of life and not be listed with the righteous.

I am in pain and distress. May your salvation, O God, protect me. I will praise God's name in song and glorify him with thanksgiving. This will please the Lord more than an ox, more than a bull with its horns and hoofs. The poor will see and be glad, you who seek God may your hearts live.

The Lord hears the needy and does not despise his captive people. Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas and all that move in them, for God will save Zion  and rebuild the cities of Judah. Then people will settle there and possess it. The children of his servants will inherit it and those who love his name will dwell there. This is God's Word.

Now, as we approach Christmas, if you come to a church, you are going to hear people  asking the question, why did Jesus come and reflect on it? Why did Jesus come? Now, we have been looking at the Psalms of the Old Testament all fall. My question, of course, to you would be, why would we look one more time at the Psalms  to find out anything about Jesus? This Psalm that we just read, Psalm 69, is quoted by Jesus in an interesting and remarkable  way.

In John chapter 15, he is discussing with his disciples the fact that people are opposed  to him and the fact that there is so much hostility to him. And then he says, in verse 25 of John chapter 15, he says, this is to fulfill what the  scripture said about me. When it said they have hated me without cause, and he quotes Psalm 69, what's going on? Here's what's going on. Jesus says Psalm 69, of course, is written by David, and it's about David, the king, and  his immediate problems and the people that hate him.

But it actually does not have a single horizon, it's got two horizons, it doesn't have just  one reference, it's got two reference. It not only refers to David and his problems, but it refers to one who is greater than  David, a greater warrior, a greater king, and far greater suffering, it's talking about  me. What we mean is that not every single part of this Psalm, but what we understand is that Jesus  read this Psalm and read it and read it and identified with it and understood the language  of this Psalm to actually describe what he was going to go through. If you've ever had a friend who's going through tremendous suffering, imagine you know a  friend going through tremendous suffering, and you come across her diary, would you read  it? You know, you treated his sacred, wouldn't you?

You wonder, maybe you shouldn't even pick it up, but if you did pick it up, you treat  it with great reverence. Well, that's what you've got here. You've got the prayer diary of the Son of God and an expression in the first person of  his anguish and his sufferings for us. Now, what we learned from it is much, but we only have time today, as we prepare to go  to the Lord's table, to look at three things that we learned from the Psalm, from his prayer  diary, about what he came to do. He came, first of all, to be a servant, second of all, to be hated and thirdly to be exchanged,  to be a servant, to be hated to be exchanged.

The first point is the longest, the second point is the shortest, the third point is the  most important. First of all, he came to be a servant. You know, you notice in verse 17, he says, why have you hidden your face from your servant? And in the very beginning of the paragraph, or the very beginning of the Psalm, he says,  I sink. Save me, O Lord, for the waters have come up to my neck.

I sink into my red depths where there is no foothold. What did Jesus come to do? He came to sink, that's the first point. He came to sink. He came to be a servant.

That's what a servant does, a servant sinks. We read Philippians 2 earlier in the service. It's all about exactly what it means for Jesus to come as a servant and to sink. There's a new book out now that's very popular written by a pastor called Descending  Indigrateness, based on Philippians 2. Years ago, another pastor, a famous pastor named Donald Green Barnhouse used to start his  sermons this way.

The way up is down. The way to go down is to go up. And what justifies that language is this, this very thing. Philippians 2, Psalm 69, the Bible says, Jesus Christ came to sink because that's what  servants do. When you look at Philippians 2, you see it.

Jesus actually took two huge steps down. That's what it means to be a servant, to go down. He goes, we're told, from heaven to earth. It says, though he was equal with God, he didn't hold on to that equality, but was found  in the form of a servant, he became a human being. And you know, when you think of the incarnation, God becoming incarnate, in the flesh, God  becoming human being, you've got to get out of your mind.

The Christmas cards with little sweet baby Jesus asleep on the hay, it looks like an ivory  soap commercial. I know you have to understand and you do understand it when you read Psalm 69. You have to understand the violence of the incarnation. The incarnation was an act of violence against Jesus. Something he willingly took.

Violence. Think for a moment with me. What is so violent about prison? What is so dehumanizing and terrible about going to prison? You stripped of your freedom.

You stripped of your personal possessions. What was so horrifying about that event some years ago? I think it was in the New York area, wasn't it? Where a man, because he was angry at a young woman who was a lovely model, had her face carved  up, was not in the New York area, also horrifying of that. Here's someone with great beauty, stripped of her beauty.

Let me tell you, the incarnation was the greatest stripping that's ever happened. Here is the fairest among 10,000. Here is the beautiful son of God, and his beauty is ripped out of him and he's cast into  this figure. And his wealth is ripped out of him and he's cast into poverty. And the love he had with the Father is ripped out of him and he's cast into loneliness.

And the joy he had is ripped out of him and he's cast into grief and the power is ripped  out of him and he's cast into weakness. You understand the violence of the incarnation? God becomes human. What does that mean? He became a cell at one point.

You know, we confess it every time we say he was conceived by the Holy Spirit. God became the weakest form of life in the universe. It was vulnerable form, a cell. Then he became a baby. His hands on nippeted hands, you see, now flailing away impotently.

The omnipotent Lord of the universe has to be changed when he soils himself. He can't change himself. The violence of the incarnation, he sank. He came to sink. And he didn't just—Philippines II doesn't just tell us there's one step down.

He took two steps. He didn't just come from heaven to earth. But once he got here, he went from the cradle to the cross. His role, his job here on earth, was not to become the head of a great political party  and sweep into power. His job was to be tortured and to be killed.

The one who knit us together in our mother's womb was deconstructed on the cross and he was  torn limb from limb. He sunk. You know, Jesus Christ is the most blatant and the most blunt and the greatest contradiction  to the world's understanding of greatness that there is. The world's understanding is promote yourself, advance your cause at the expense of other  people. A crew, the wealth and power.

Look out for number one. And Jesus, ascended by descending the way up, he taught us is the way down. The way to power, he taught us is to serve. The way to rule is to submit. The way to lose your life, to find your life is to lose your life.

The way to find your happiness is not to seek your happiness, but to seek the happiness  of others. And you know what a Christian is? A Christian is somebody who, in absolute contradiction to all the world's wisdom, decides  to follow that as the pattern for your own life. Before we move on, I just want you to think about that for a second. If you're a Christian and a servant, of course, is not greater than his master, then you're  a servant of the great servant, obviously, it means that you have also decided the way  up for me is down.

Have you decided that? Have you decided that the essence of my life is to sink? Let me just give you a couple of examples of what it means to be a Christian. For example, the very first step, the very first action a Christian takes as a Christian. In other words, conversion itself.

The very first thing you can do to even become a Christian is you rise up to God by going  down in repentance. You will not go up unless you go down. Well, let me put it as stark as possible. I know there's some of you here. I know who would like to say, yes, I make mistakes, I'm not perfect, but can you say to  other people and to God that I am a helpless sinner, that I should be cast off, that I'm  acting, even though I've been created by God, I act as if on my own creator, and even  though God is my king, I act as if on my own king, I deserve to be cut off.

I am a helpless sinner, I need a savior and a new master. Can you say that? Now, this is New York City, I know there's people out there who think that that is a  most primitive thing, the most primitive kind of religion. How regressive you say, of course it's regressive, it's a step down. And if you feel that that's too primitive, and if you couldn't say that, then you're  not a servant yet, and your intellectual pride is keeping you from going down and therefore  from coming up.

I'm going to give you another example, to be a Christian, you go down to repentance constantly. To be a Christian also, you go down in your living standards, let me get real practical  about this. The Bible says, look at Jesus, though he was rich, he became poor, that through his poverty  might become rich. The Bible continually says that a Christian is someone who looks out there at all kinds  of needs, you see needy people, you see all sorts of important causes, you see the work  of a church, you see ministries that are helping people in word indeed, and before you become  a Christian, before you understand this principle, before this spirit of servitude, this mind  that was in Christ Jesus passes into you, you only give what you can afford. Now you know how you define the word afford?

What you mean is, I can only give, as long as my giving does not lower the actual standards  of living in my life, in other words, I can give as long as it doesn't make me go down,  as long as it doesn't actually have an impact on where I can go this summer, as long  as it doesn't have an impact on how many options I have to go out to eat tonight, as  long as it doesn't change my living standard. But that's not what Jesus did, Jesus living standards were changed fairly drastically. And when you become a Christian, you realize that you have to give sacrificial, which means,  oh, let me put it this way, do you give your money away to people and to causes so generously  that your living standard is going down? If not, you're not a servant yet, and your love of comfort is keeping you from going down  and therefore rising up. You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger  brother.

In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who  try to earn his love by being good. In his book The prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart  of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental  older brother, and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal, extravagant grace. Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith, the prodigal God will help  you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way. The prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel and life share  the hope and joy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the world. That's your copy today at gospelandlife.comslashgive that's gospelandlife.comslashgive.

Let me give you one more example. If Philippians 2 were told he made himself of no reputation, a person before you become  a Christian, before the spirit of servanthood, before you understand the principle of the way  down is up, the way up is to go down. And help people, as long as you get thanks, as long as you get affirmation, as long as  you get some recognition, as long as you get some paths on the back, fine. This is how you tell the difference between a person who is serving out of selfishness  and a real servant who's not in it for a payoff. You make yourself of no reputation.

You're not in it for the thanks you get, only put it to this way. You need a lot of thanks, do you need, are you always having your nose been out of shape  because you feel taken for granted and you feel that people aren't recognizing what  you're putting in and nobody seems to know how hard you work. I work my fingers to the bone around this church and what thanks do I get. If that's how you feel, you're not a servant yet and your need for approval is keeping  you from moving down so that you can come up. You see, what God says is, lose your money and I'll give you another kind of riches.

Lose your recognition and I'll give you another kind of honor. Lose your obsession with staying in control and I'll give you another kind of security. Lose your life and you'll find it. He came to sink and Christians are people who know that the way down is up and the way  to go up is to go down. Secondly, he came to be hated.

Now, remember, as I mentioned to you, he quotes in the New Testament, he quotes this verse. He doesn't quote the first couple of verses though. It's obvious that he's looking at all of this and he's thinking of himself. This is his language, this is his heart, but he quotes verse 4 where it says, those  who hate me without reason out in number the hairs of my head, many of the enemies without  cause. I'm going to be real brief on this when I warned you, but it's very important.

Jesus in the New Testament points out the fact that people automatically will hate him  without reason. They'll hate him irrationally because he's holy. There is something in the human heart that is afraid of real holiness. We know, when I was some years ago, a movie that came out casually as a war and it was  about a man who decides to tell the truth about what happened out in Vietnam, even though  it was going to jeopardize his life, even though it was going to ruin his career, even though  it was going to make have a tremendous impact on his life and he did it anyway. And the movie reviewer here in New York Times, Vincent Canbey, points out this.

He says, such selfless moral conviction always makes a person a pariah because such purity  of spirit is totally frightening to us. What he means is we have got in our hearts an engine of self-justification and the way  we continually convince ourselves that we're okay is that when we get near a standard of  godliness that shows up our own flaws, we either run from it or we run it down. We either run it down or run away. That's true of anything, anyone who's living a straight life, living a servant life. Now when Jesus shows up, his standard is so lofty and so high that they hate him without  cause.

He has not enemies without number, but I tell you that if you and I are going to follow  Jesus and if you and I are going to be servants, that's always the mark of a servant. A servant will always be hated without a cause. He'll be a couple of examples. A friend of mine who years ago was a cop, a policeman in a large city in the United States. He became a Christian.

He had trouble with something and that is that the pimps in the precinct would come in  and give a lot of money to the sergeant who would pass it out to all the officers so that  they would not pick up the prostitutes that put money in the pool. After my friend became a Christian, he decided he didn't want to take that money and at  one point a guy comes up to him and says, hey, you better start taking that money. These don't like the fact that you seem to think you're more pure than the rest of us  and you better take that money or the next time you need to back up, it might come slowly. I remember talking to a family when I was living in Philadelphia and when the very first black  family moved into their white neighborhood. They went over as Christians, as friends took them some pies and greeted them and afterwards  they were absolutely vilified and attacked by the other white families in that neighborhood  and they said, my house is the only thing I've got.

If those people start coming in, it's going to sink down, you're going to ruin me. How can you do this to me? A man once came to me and said after he became a Christian, if I start to report my income  truly and start to pay the taxes, I really owe all my other co-workers are going to be  nailed by the IRS as well. What do I do? All I can tell you is not what these people did, but I can tell you is this, normal  servanthood, normal, moral lives will bring you hatred without cause.

Normal human living, normal moral behavior, normal Christian living is going to show up  the racism in the neighborhood, it's going to show up the dishonesty at work, it's going  to show up the gossip at the office, it's going to show up the promiscuity of the party  and you will be hated with that cause, are you or you just blend into your surroundings? Does anybody hate you without cause? Then you're not following Jesus because servants sink and servants are hated with that cause. Number three, and the most important, Jesus Christ did not simply come to be a servant  and come to be hated in a sense, that's the general gist of what it means to say he came  as a servant, but he came very specifically to be exchanged. They put it to this way, in verse nine, now David, the guy who writes this song is very perplexed.

He can't see what we can see, he can't read his own experience through Jesus. In verse nine, he says,  Zeal for your house consumes me and the insults of those who insult you fall on me. Now David is perplexed. He says, like I mentioned in verse 17, he says,  How can you let your servant, how can you hide your face from your servant? I'm doing everything right, I'm being an exemplary servant, I'm loving you, I'm true to you.

Zeal for your house, for your cause consumes me. Why in the world are you letting me suffer innocently? Or let me put it this way, he says, Zeal for your house consumes me. And then he says the insults, the people insult you fall on me. That which I do not deserve is falling on me.

How could it be, says David? Jesus says,  That's what I came to do. But that which I did not deserve fell on me. Isaiah talks about the suffering servant in these terms. He simply says in Isaiah 52 and 53,  See my servant will act wisely,  Yet it was the Lord's will to crush him and cause him to suffer.

And though the Lord makes him like his life a guilt offering,  The results of his suffering he will see and he shall be satisfied. Listen with me for a second. Think with me. This is the doctrine of substitution. Whenever I ask one of my sons to pick up something,  You know, this is a mess in here, pick it up.

If it so happened that my son was guilty of making the mess,  He will reluctantly usually get up and start doing it slowly. But if, well, one to me,  If I ask one particular son to pick up the mess  that has actually been caused by the failures and sins of some other son. In that situation,  The son will say, that's not my fault. Why should I take the hit for the failing of another? Why should I suffer in a substitutionary way  for the fault failings in the sins of someone else?

Let's pick this up. This is an instinct. This is exactly what your heart say. Ah, someone says, you know,  for whatever reason,  Because of all sorts of failures,  Failures on the part of the person,  Failures on the part of his family,  Failures on the part of the system,  Failures on the part of the city,  We now have a great need for lots of drug rehabilitation centers. We need homeless rehabilitation centers.

We need to put them in your neighborhood and what's the attitude? What's the attitude? Why should I take the hit for the sins of someone else? Why should I suffer substitutionally for the failings of someone else? That's the instinct.

That's how we always feel. But that's not how a servant's heart operates. Let me tell you how a servant's heart operates. The servant says, I know this isn't my fault. But somebody's got to take the hit.

And somebody's going to have to pay the price. And so I will do it. I will take the hit. I will pay the price. I will substitutionally suffer.

Now, do you understand why Jesus was the greatest servant of all? Because he just didn't do a little. He took the hit for the sins of the world. He suffered substitutionally for the sins of everyone. And that is what's being depicted here.

He took the biggest hit. He took the greatest weight. He took on himself the most incredible debt. That's why when he reads those words, father, why have you hidden your face from your servant? He knows the answer.

Because when he was on the cross and he was saying, why have you hidden your face from your servant? Why? My God have you forsaken me. As God the Father turned away from him. The Father said, son, you know why I have to do this to you.

Because we agreed to do this from all eternity. No, why am I hiding my face from you? Because it's got to fall on you. It will all fall on you. In your mind's eye, look at him.

And then read Psalm 69. Look at him up there. Blood coming down his face. His eyes swollen shut because he's been beaten. His back is ripped open because of the scourging.

He's suffocating up on the cross and then read. I looked for sympathy, but there was none. I looked for comforters and I found none. My heart is breaking and there's nobody to bind it up. It fell on him.

Don't you see some of you out there. Listen, this is some of you who've done some terrible things. But don't you see there's hope for anybody. There may be people out here. This is New York City.

Maybe people out here who have murdered people. There's people out here who've done some terrible things and you hate yourselves. And at some deep level, you're saying nothing can help me. I deserve to be spit upon. I deserve to be beaten.

I deserve to be condemned. Do you see? Do you finally see? It fell on him. In other words, if you believe in Jesus Christ,  you've already been beaten.

You're right, but you've already been beaten. You're right, but you've already been spit upon. You're right, but you've already been condemned. And there's plenty of you that haven't done anything that awful. And don't you see what's going on in your lives?

Look at yourselves. Why are you working so hard? Why are you working so desperately hard? Why is there this franticness about your life trying to prove yourself? Or why is there all this grumpiness and irritability about your life trying to defend yourself?

Don't you see? Stop it! It's been paid. Stop trying to pay for it. It fell on you.

Lord Jesus, say that. It fell on you, Lord Jesus, for me. Let's conclude this way. Don't you see what's so wonderful about the teaching of the Bible? Jesus Christ did not come only as God-servant.

No, he didn't come only as a model of what it means to serve God. If that's all he was, oh, we'd be in such trouble. We'd look at him and he'd be mad at him. We'd run from him. We'd hate him without cause.

But instead, he sunk for me. And you, he sunk for us. He was hated for us. He was exchanged for us. He comes to actually serve and wait on us.

It says in Luke, Jesus tells this parable about himself. And he says in the book of Luke,  blessed are those servants whose master finds them watching when he comes. He will gird himself to serve and will come and wait on them. Do you know what that means? On the last day, if he finds you serving him, on the last day,  he's going to gird himself.

The gird means to pick up your robes and stick them in your belt  so that you can concentrate. He's going to gird himself. He's going to pull up all the infinities and immensities of his infinite  omnipotent power and he's going to bring them all to bear to serve you,  to heal you, to love you, to satisfy you, to honor you. Blessed will those servants be. Are you ready for that day?

If tomorrow's that day, would you be one of those servants? Don't forget to be a real servant. Isn't somebody who's trying to save him or herself by your service? Because the first act of a real servant is to say,  because only love me and accept me because it fell on you. I'm a sinner.

I can't save myself through my serving. The first act of service is to say accept me because,  O Lord Jesus, it all fell on you. The bread and the cup. When you get the bread, it's going to be broken. And as you eat it, you'll break it more.

Listen to what it says. It says,  Do you know why I was broken? Do you know why I was forsaken? Do you know why my father hid his face  so it could fall on me for you? Let's pray.

Father, we ask as we take the bread and the cup  that we might go down to come up. We pray that we might learn what it means  that your sons die for us and suffered for us. And the more we think about this is we take the bread and cup,  make us servants as well. Men and women who will go down in their bank accounts,  go down in recognition, go down in the status and eyes of the world,  go down in repentance,  but who will find a new kind of honor, a new kind of riches,  a new kind of joy. Father, as we take the bread and cup,  do all that in us.

We pray in Jesus' name, amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today's podcast where Tim Keller explores the person and promises of Jesus  Christ. A reading from Psalm 69. Save me, O God, for the waters have come up to my neck. I sink in the myoree depths where there is no foothold. I have come into the deep waters, the floods engulf me.

I am worn out calling for help. My throat is parched. My eyes fail looking for my God. Those who hate me without reason outnumber the hairs of my head. Many are my enemies without cause.

Those who seek to destroy me. I am forced to restore what I did not steal. You know my folly, O God. My guilt is not hidden from you. May those who open you not be disgraced because of me, O Lord, the Lord Almighty.

May those who seek you not be put to shame because of me, O God of Israel. For I endure scorn for your sake and shame covers my face. I am a stranger to my brothers and alien to my own mother's sons, for zeal for your  house consumes me and the insults of those who insult you fall on me. When I weep and fast, I must endure scorn. When I put on sackcloth, people make sport of me.

Those who sit at the gate mock me and I am the song of the drunkards. But I pray to you, O Lord, in the time of your favor, in your great love, O God, answer  me with your sure salvation. Rescue me from the mire. Do not let me sink. Deliver me from those who hate me from the deep waters.

Do not let the floodwaters engulf me or the depths swallow me up or the pit close its  mouth over me. Answer me, O Lord, out of the goodness of your love in your great mercy turned to me. Do not hide your face from your servant. Answer me quickly for I am in trouble. Come near and rescue me.

Redeem me because of my foes. You know how I am scorned, disgraced and shamed. All my enemies are before you. God has broken my heart and has left me helpless. I looked for sympathy, but there was none, for comfortors, but I found none.

They put gall in my food and gave me vinegar for my thirst. May the table set before them become a snare. May it become retribution and a trap. May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see and their backs be bent forever. Pour out your wrath on them, let your fierce anger overtake them.

May their place be deserted, let there be no one to dwell in their tents. For they persecute those you wound and talk about the pain of those you hurt. Charge them with crime upon crime. Do not let them share in your salvation. May they be blotted out of the book of life and not be listed with the righteous.

I am in pain and distress. May your salvation, O God, protect me. I will praise God's name in song and glorify him with thanksgiving. This will please the Lord more than an ox, more than a bull with its horns and hoofs. The poor will see and be glad, you who seek God may your hearts live.

The Lord hears the needy and does not despise his captive people. Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas and all that move in them, for God will save Zion  and rebuild the cities of Judah. Then people will settle there and possess it. The children of his servants will inherit it and those who love his name will dwell there. This is God's Word.

Now, as we approach Christmas, if you come to a church, you are going to hear people  asking the question, why did Jesus come and reflect on it? Why did Jesus come? Now, we have been looking at the Psalms of the Old Testament all fall. My question, of course, to you would be, why would we look one more time at the Psalms  to find out anything about Jesus? This Psalm that we just read, Psalm 69, is quoted by Jesus in an interesting and remarkable  way.

In John chapter 15, he is discussing with his disciples the fact that people are opposed  to him and the fact that there is so much hostility to him. And then he says, in verse 25 of John chapter 15, he says, this is to fulfill what the  scripture said about me. When it said they have hated me without cause, and he quotes Psalm 69, what's going on? Here's what's going on. Jesus says Psalm 69, of course, is written by David, and it's about David, the king, and  his immediate problems and the people that hate him.

But it actually does not have a single horizon, it's got two horizons, it doesn't have just  one reference, it's got two reference. It not only refers to David and his problems, but it refers to one who is greater than  David, a greater warrior, a greater king, and far greater suffering, it's talking about  me. What we mean is that not every single part of this Psalm, but what we understand is that Jesus  read this Psalm and read it and read it and identified with it and understood the language  of this Psalm to actually describe what he was going to go through. If you've ever had a friend who's going through tremendous suffering, imagine you know a  friend going through tremendous suffering, and you come across her diary, would you read  it? You know, you treated his sacred, wouldn't you?

You wonder, maybe you shouldn't even pick it up, but if you did pick it up, you treat  it with great reverence. Well, that's what you've got here. You've got the prayer diary of the Son of God and an expression in the first person of  his anguish and his sufferings for us. Now, what we learned from it is much, but we only have time today, as we prepare to go  to the Lord's table, to look at three things that we learned from the Psalm, from his prayer  diary, about what he came to do. He came, first of all, to be a servant, second of all, to be hated and thirdly to be exchanged,  to be a servant, to be hated to be exchanged.

The first point is the longest, the second point is the shortest, the third point is the  most important. First of all, he came to be a servant. You know, you notice in verse 17, he says, why have you hidden your face from your servant? And in the very beginning of the paragraph, or the very beginning of the Psalm, he says,  I sink. Save me, O Lord, for the waters have come up to my neck.

I sink into my red depths where there is no foothold. What did Jesus come to do? He came to sink, that's the first point. He came to sink. He came to be a servant.

That's what a servant does, a servant sinks. We read Philippians 2 earlier in the service. It's all about exactly what it means for Jesus to come as a servant and to sink. There's a new book out now that's very popular written by a pastor called Descending  Indigrateness, based on Philippians 2. Years ago, another pastor, a famous pastor named Donald Green Barnhouse used to start his  sermons this way.

The way up is down. The way to go down is to go up. And what justifies that language is this, this very thing. Philippians 2, Psalm 69, the Bible says, Jesus Christ came to sink because that's what  servants do. When you look at Philippians 2, you see it.

Jesus actually took two huge steps down. That's what it means to be a servant, to go down. He goes, we're told, from heaven to earth. It says, though he was equal with God, he didn't hold on to that equality, but was found  in the form of a servant, he became a human being. And you know, when you think of the incarnation, God becoming incarnate, in the flesh, God  becoming human being, you've got to get out of your mind.

The Christmas cards with little sweet baby Jesus asleep on the hay, it looks like an ivory  soap commercial. I know you have to understand and you do understand it when you read Psalm 69. You have to understand the violence of the incarnation. The incarnation was an act of violence against Jesus. Something he willingly took.

Violence. Think for a moment with me. What is so violent about prison? What is so dehumanizing and terrible about going to prison? You stripped of your freedom.

You stripped of your personal possessions. What was so horrifying about that event some years ago? I think it was in the New York area, wasn't it? Where a man, because he was angry at a young woman who was a lovely model, had her face carved  up, was not in the New York area, also horrifying of that. Here's someone with great beauty, stripped of her beauty.

Let me tell you, the incarnation was the greatest stripping that's ever happened. Here is the fairest among 10,000. Here is the beautiful son of God, and his beauty is ripped out of him and he's cast into  this figure. And his wealth is ripped out of him and he's cast into poverty. And the love he had with the Father is ripped out of him and he's cast into loneliness.

And the joy he had is ripped out of him and he's cast into grief and the power is ripped  out of him and he's cast into weakness. You understand the violence of the incarnation? God becomes human. What does that mean? He became a cell at one point.

You know, we confess it every time we say he was conceived by the Holy Spirit. God became the weakest form of life in the universe. It was vulnerable form, a cell. Then he became a baby. His hands on nippeted hands, you see, now flailing away impotently.

The omnipotent Lord of the universe has to be changed when he soils himself. He can't change himself. The violence of the incarnation, he sank. He came to sink. And he didn't just—Philippines II doesn't just tell us there's one step down.

He took two steps. He didn't just come from heaven to earth. But once he got here, he went from the cradle to the cross. His role, his job here on earth, was not to become the head of a great political party  and sweep into power. His job was to be tortured and to be killed.

The one who knit us together in our mother's womb was deconstructed on the cross and he was  torn limb from limb. He sunk. You know, Jesus Christ is the most blatant and the most blunt and the greatest contradiction  to the world's understanding of greatness that there is. The world's understanding is promote yourself, advance your cause at the expense of other  people. A crew, the wealth and power.

Look out for number one. And Jesus, ascended by descending the way up, he taught us is the way down. The way to power, he taught us is to serve. The way to rule is to submit. The way to lose your life, to find your life is to lose your life.

The way to find your happiness is not to seek your happiness, but to seek the happiness  of others. And you know what a Christian is? A Christian is somebody who, in absolute contradiction to all the world's wisdom, decides  to follow that as the pattern for your own life. Before we move on, I just want you to think about that for a second. If you're a Christian and a servant, of course, is not greater than his master, then you're  a servant of the great servant, obviously, it means that you have also decided the way  up for me is down.

Have you decided that? Have you decided that the essence of my life is to sink? Let me just give you a couple of examples of what it means to be a Christian. For example, the very first step, the very first action a Christian takes as a Christian. In other words, conversion itself.

The very first thing you can do to even become a Christian is you rise up to God by going  down in repentance. You will not go up unless you go down. Well, let me put it as stark as possible. I know there's some of you here. I know who would like to say, yes, I make mistakes, I'm not perfect, but can you say to  other people and to God that I am a helpless sinner, that I should be cast off, that I'm  acting, even though I've been created by God, I act as if on my own creator, and even  though God is my king, I act as if on my own king, I deserve to be cut off.

I am a helpless sinner, I need a savior and a new master. Can you say that? Now, this is New York City, I know there's people out there who think that that is a  most primitive thing, the most primitive kind of religion. How regressive you say, of course it's regressive, it's a step down. And if you feel that that's too primitive, and if you couldn't say that, then you're  not a servant yet, and your intellectual pride is keeping you from going down and therefore  from coming up.

I'm going to give you another example, to be a Christian, you go down to repentance constantly. To be a Christian also, you go down in your living standards, let me get real practical  about this. The Bible says, look at Jesus, though he was rich, he became poor, that through his poverty  might become rich. The Bible continually says that a Christian is someone who looks out there at all kinds  of needs, you see needy people, you see all sorts of important causes, you see the work  of a church, you see ministries that are helping people in word indeed, and before you become  a Christian, before you understand this principle, before this spirit of servitude, this mind  that was in Christ Jesus passes into you, you only give what you can afford. Now you know how you define the word afford?

What you mean is, I can only give, as long as my giving does not lower the actual standards  of living in my life, in other words, I can give as long as it doesn't make me go down,  as long as it doesn't actually have an impact on where I can go this summer, as long  as it doesn't have an impact on how many options I have to go out to eat tonight, as  long as it doesn't change my living standard. But that's not what Jesus did, Jesus living standards were changed fairly drastically. And when you become a Christian, you realize that you have to give sacrificial, which means,  oh, let me put it this way, do you give your money away to people and to causes so generously  that your living standard is going down? If not, you're not a servant yet, and your love of comfort is keeping you from going down  and therefore rising up. You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger  brother.

In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who  try to earn his love by being good. In his book The prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart  of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental  older brother, and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal, extravagant grace. Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith, the prodigal God will help  you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way. The prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel and life share  the hope and joy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the world. That's your copy today at gospelandlife.comslashgive that's gospelandlife.comslashgive.

Let me give you one more example. If Philippians 2 were told he made himself of no reputation, a person before you become  a Christian, before the spirit of servanthood, before you understand the principle of the way  down is up, the way up is to go down. And help people, as long as you get thanks, as long as you get affirmation, as long as  you get some recognition, as long as you get some paths on the back, fine. This is how you tell the difference between a person who is serving out of selfishness  and a real servant who's not in it for a payoff. You make yourself of no reputation.

You're not in it for the thanks you get, only put it to this way. You need a lot of thanks, do you need, are you always having your nose been out of shape  because you feel taken for granted and you feel that people aren't recognizing what  you're putting in and nobody seems to know how hard you work. I work my fingers to the bone around this church and what thanks do I get. If that's how you feel, you're not a servant yet and your need for approval is keeping  you from moving down so that you can come up. You see, what God says is, lose your money and I'll give you another kind of riches.

Lose your recognition and I'll give you another kind of honor. Lose your obsession with staying in control and I'll give you another kind of security. Lose your life and you'll find it. He came to sink and Christians are people who know that the way down is up and the way  to go up is to go down. Secondly, he came to be hated.

Now, remember, as I mentioned to you, he quotes in the New Testament, he quotes this verse. He doesn't quote the first couple of verses though. It's obvious that he's looking at all of this and he's thinking of himself. This is his language, this is his heart, but he quotes verse 4 where it says, those  who hate me without reason out in number the hairs of my head, many of the enemies without  cause. I'm going to be real brief on this when I warned you, but it's very important.

Jesus in the New Testament points out the fact that people automatically will hate him  without reason. They'll hate him irrationally because he's holy. There is something in the human heart that is afraid of real holiness. We know, when I was some years ago, a movie that came out casually as a war and it was  about a man who decides to tell the truth about what happened out in Vietnam, even though  it was going to jeopardize his life, even though it was going to ruin his career, even though  it was going to make have a tremendous impact on his life and he did it anyway. And the movie reviewer here in New York Times, Vincent Canbey, points out this.

He says, such selfless moral conviction always makes a person a pariah because such purity  of spirit is totally frightening to us. What he means is we have got in our hearts an engine of self-justification and the way  we continually convince ourselves that we're okay is that when we get near a standard of  godliness that shows up our own flaws, we either run from it or we run it down. We either run it down or run away. That's true of anything, anyone who's living a straight life, living a servant life. Now when Jesus shows up, his standard is so lofty and so high that they hate him without  cause.

He has not enemies without number, but I tell you that if you and I are going to follow  Jesus and if you and I are going to be servants, that's always the mark of a servant. A servant will always be hated without a cause. He'll be a couple of examples. A friend of mine who years ago was a cop, a policeman in a large city in the United States. He became a Christian.

He had trouble with something and that is that the pimps in the precinct would come in  and give a lot of money to the sergeant who would pass it out to all the officers so that  they would not pick up the prostitutes that put money in the pool. After my friend became a Christian, he decided he didn't want to take that money and at  one point a guy comes up to him and says, hey, you better start taking that money. These don't like the fact that you seem to think you're more pure than the rest of us  and you better take that money or the next time you need to back up, it might come slowly. I remember talking to a family when I was living in Philadelphia and when the very first black  family moved into their white neighborhood. They went over as Christians, as friends took them some pies and greeted them and afterwards  they were absolutely vilified and attacked by the other white families in that neighborhood  and they said, my house is the only thing I've got.

If those people start coming in, it's going to sink down, you're going to ruin me. How can you do this to me? A man once came to me and said after he became a Christian, if I start to report my income  truly and start to pay the taxes, I really owe all my other co-workers are going to be  nailed by the IRS as well. What do I do? All I can tell you is not what these people did, but I can tell you is this, normal  servanthood, normal, moral lives will bring you hatred without cause.

Normal human living, normal moral behavior, normal Christian living is going to show up  the racism in the neighborhood, it's going to show up the dishonesty at work, it's going  to show up the gossip at the office, it's going to show up the promiscuity of the party  and you will be hated with that cause, are you or you just blend into your surroundings? Does anybody hate you without cause? Then you're not following Jesus because servants sink and servants are hated with that cause. Number three, and the most important, Jesus Christ did not simply come to be a servant  and come to be hated in a sense, that's the general gist of what it means to say he came  as a servant, but he came very specifically to be exchanged. They put it to this way, in verse nine, now David, the guy who writes this song is very perplexed.

He can't see what we can see, he can't read his own experience through Jesus. In verse nine, he says,  Zeal for your house consumes me and the insults of those who insult you fall on me. Now David is perplexed. He says, like I mentioned in verse 17, he says,  How can you let your servant, how can you hide your face from your servant? I'm doing everything right, I'm being an exemplary servant, I'm loving you, I'm true to you.

Zeal for your house, for your cause consumes me. Why in the world are you letting me suffer innocently? Or let me put it this way, he says, Zeal for your house consumes me. And then he says the insults, the people insult you fall on me. That which I do not deserve is falling on me.

How could it be, says David? Jesus says,  That's what I came to do. But that which I did not deserve fell on me. Isaiah talks about the suffering servant in these terms. He simply says in Isaiah 52 and 53,  See my servant will act wisely,  Yet it was the Lord's will to crush him and cause him to suffer.

And though the Lord makes him like his life a guilt offering,  The results of his suffering he will see and he shall be satisfied. Listen with me for a second. Think with me. This is the doctrine of substitution. Whenever I ask one of my sons to pick up something,  You know, this is a mess in here, pick it up.

If it so happened that my son was guilty of making the mess,  He will reluctantly usually get up and start doing it slowly. But if, well, one to me,  If I ask one particular son to pick up the mess  that has actually been caused by the failures and sins of some other son. In that situation,  The son will say, that's not my fault. Why should I take the hit for the failing of another? Why should I suffer in a substitutionary way  for the fault failings in the sins of someone else?

Let's pick this up. This is an instinct. This is exactly what your heart say. Ah, someone says, you know,  for whatever reason,  Because of all sorts of failures,  Failures on the part of the person,  Failures on the part of his family,  Failures on the part of the system,  Failures on the part of the city,  We now have a great need for lots of drug rehabilitation centers. We need homeless rehabilitation centers.

We need to put them in your neighborhood and what's the attitude? What's the attitude? Why should I take the hit for the sins of someone else? Why should I suffer substitutionally for the failings of someone else? That's the instinct.

That's how we always feel. But that's not how a servant's heart operates. Let me tell you how a servant's heart operates. The servant says, I know this isn't my fault. But somebody's got to take the hit.

And somebody's going to have to pay the price. And so I will do it. I will take the hit. I will pay the price. I will substitutionally suffer.

Now, do you understand why Jesus was the greatest servant of all? Because he just didn't do a little. He took the hit for the sins of the world. He suffered substitutionally for the sins of everyone. And that is what's being depicted here.

He took the biggest hit. He took the greatest weight. He took on himself the most incredible debt. That's why when he reads those words, father, why have you hidden your face from your servant? He knows the answer.

Because when he was on the cross and he was saying, why have you hidden your face from your servant? Why? My God have you forsaken me. As God the Father turned away from him. The Father said, son, you know why I have to do this to you.

Because we agreed to do this from all eternity. No, why am I hiding my face from you? Because it's got to fall on you. It will all fall on you. In your mind's eye, look at him.

And then read Psalm 69. Look at him up there. Blood coming down his face. His eyes swollen shut because he's been beaten. His back is ripped open because of the scourging.

He's suffocating up on the cross and then read. I looked for sympathy, but there was none. I looked for comforters and I found none. My heart is breaking and there's nobody to bind it up. It fell on him.

Don't you see some of you out there. Listen, this is some of you who've done some terrible things. But don't you see there's hope for anybody. There may be people out here. This is New York City.

Maybe people out here who have murdered people. There's people out here who've done some terrible things and you hate yourselves. And at some deep level, you're saying nothing can help me. I deserve to be spit upon. I deserve to be beaten.

I deserve to be condemned. Do you see? Do you finally see? It fell on him. In other words, if you believe in Jesus Christ,  you've already been beaten.

You're right, but you've already been beaten. You're right, but you've already been spit upon. You're right, but you've already been condemned. And there's plenty of you that haven't done anything that awful. And don't you see what's going on in your lives?

Look at yourselves. Why are you working so hard? Why are you working so desperately hard? Why is there this franticness about your life trying to prove yourself? Or why is there all this grumpiness and irritability about your life trying to defend yourself?

Don't you see? Stop it! It's been paid. Stop trying to pay for it. It fell on you.

Lord Jesus, say that. It fell on you, Lord Jesus, for me. Let's conclude this way. Don't you see what's so wonderful about the teaching of the Bible? Jesus Christ did not come only as God-servant.

No, he didn't come only as a model of what it means to serve God. If that's all he was, oh, we'd be in such trouble. We'd look at him and he'd be mad at him. We'd run from him. We'd hate him without cause.

But instead, he sunk for me. And you, he sunk for us. He was hated for us. He was exchanged for us. He comes to actually serve and wait on us.

It says in Luke, Jesus tells this parable about himself. And he says in the book of Luke,  blessed are those servants whose master finds them watching when he comes. He will gird himself to serve and will come and wait on them. Do you know what that means? On the last day, if he finds you serving him, on the last day,  he's going to gird himself.

The gird means to pick up your robes and stick them in your belt  so that you can concentrate. He's going to gird himself. He's going to pull up all the infinities and immensities of his infinite  omnipotent power and he's going to bring them all to bear to serve you,  to heal you, to love you, to satisfy you, to honor you. Blessed will those servants be. Are you ready for that day?

If tomorrow's that day, would you be one of those servants? Don't forget to be a real servant. Isn't somebody who's trying to save him or herself by your service? Because the first act of a real servant is to say,  because only love me and accept me because it fell on you. I'm a sinner.

I can't save myself through my serving. The first act of service is to say accept me because,  O Lord Jesus, it all fell on you. The bread and the cup. When you get the bread, it's going to be broken. And as you eat it, you'll break it more.

Listen to what it says. It says,  Do you know why I was broken? Do you know why I was forsaken? Do you know why my father hid his face  so it could fall on me for you? Let's pray.

Father, we ask as we take the bread and the cup  that we might go down to come up. We pray that we might learn what it means  that your sons die for us and suffered for us. And the more we think about this is we take the bread and cup,  make us servants as well. Men and women who will go down in their bank accounts,  go down in recognition, go down in the status and eyes of the world,  go down in repentance,  but who will find a new kind of honor, a new kind of riches,  a new kind of joy. Father, as we take the bread and cup,  do all that in us.

We pray in Jesus' name, amen.

### 中文翻译

欢迎来到今天的播客，Tim Keller探讨耶稣基督的身份和应许。让我来诵读诗篇69篇。

> 神啊，求你救我！因为众水要淹没我。我陷在深淤泥中，没有立脚之地；我到了深水中，大水漫过我身。我因呼求困乏，喉咙发干；我因等候神，眼睛失明。无故恨我的，比我头发还多；无理与我为仇、要把我剪除的，甚是强盛。我没有抢夺的，要叫我偿还。神啊，我的愚昧你原知道，我的罪愆不能隐瞒。万军的主耶和华啊，求你叫那等候你的，不要因我蒙羞！以色列的神啊，求你叫那寻求你的，不要因我受辱！

> 因我为你的缘故受了辱骂，满面羞愧。我的弟兄看我为外路人，我同母的弟兄看我为外邦人。因我为你的殿心里焦急，如同火烧，并且辱骂你人的辱骂都落在我身上。我哭泣，以禁食刻苦我心，这倒算为我的羞辱。我拿麻布当衣裳，就成了他们的笑谈。坐在城门口的谈论我，酒徒也以我为歌曲。

> 但我在悦纳的时候向你耶和华祈祷。神啊，求你按你丰盛的慈爱，凭你拯救的诚实应允我！求你搭救我出离淤泥，不叫我陷在其中；求你使我脱离那些恨我的人，使我出离深水。求你不容大水漫过我，不容深渊吞灭我，不容坑坎在我以上合口。耶和华啊，求你应允我，因为你的慈爱本为美好；求你按你丰盛的慈悲回转眷顾我！不要掩面不顾你的仆人，我是在急难之中，求你速速应允我！求你亲近我，救赎我！求你因我的仇敌把我赎回！

> 你知道我受的辱骂、欺凌、羞辱，我的敌人都在你面前。辱骂伤破了我的心，我又满了忧愁。我指望有人体恤，却没有一个；我指望有人安慰，却找不着一个。他们拿苦胆给我当食物，我渴了，他们拿醋给我喝。

> 愿他们的筵席在他们面前变为网罗，在他们平安的时候变为绊脚石。愿他们的眼睛昏蒙，不得看见；愿你使他们的腰常常战抖。求你将你的恼恨倒在他们身上，叫你的烈怒追上他们。愿他们的住处变为荒场，愿他们的帐棚无人居住。因为你所击打的，他们就逼迫；你所击伤的，他们戏说他的愁苦。愿你在他们的罪上加罪，不容他们在你面前称义。愿他们从生命册上被涂抹，不得记录在义人之中。

> 但我是困苦忧伤的。神啊，愿你的救恩将我安置在高处。我要以诗歌赞美神的名，以感谢称他为大！这便叫耶和华喜悦，胜似献牛，或是献有角有蹄的公牛。谦卑的人看见了就喜乐，寻求神的人，愿你们的心苏醒！因为耶和华听了穷乏人，不藐视被囚的人。愿天和地、洋海和其中一切的动物都赞美他！因为神要拯救锡安，建造犹大的城邑；他的民要在那里居住，得以为业。他仆人的后裔要承受为业，爱他名的人也要住在其中。

这是神的话语。

当我们临近圣诞节，如果你去教会，你会听到人们问这个问题，耶稣为什么来，并反思这个问题？耶稣为什么来？现在，我们整个秋天都在查考旧约的诗篇。我的问题，当然，对你来说是，我们为什么要再次看诗篇来了解关于耶稣的任何事情？我们刚刚读的这篇诗篇，诗篇69篇，被耶稣以一种有趣和非凡的方式引用。

在约翰福音第15章，他正在和门徒讨论人们反对他的事实以及对他有如此多的敌意。然后他在约翰福音第15章25节说，他说，这要应验经上说我的话。当经上说他们无故恨我，他引用诗篇69篇，这是怎么回事？这就是发生的事情。耶稣说诗篇69篇，当然是大卫写的，是关于大卫这位王的，以及他眼前的问题和恨他的人。但它实际上不只有一个视野，它有两个视野，它不只有一个指向，它有两个指向。它不仅指向大卫和他的问题，而且指向一位比大卫更大的人，一位更大的勇士，一位更大的王，远更大的受苦，它在谈论我。

我们的意思是，不是这篇诗篇的每一个部分，但我们理解的是，耶稣读了这篇诗篇，一遍又一遍地读，并认同它，理解这篇诗篇的语言实际上描述了他将要经历的。如果你曾经有一个正在经历巨大痛苦的朋友，想象你知道一个正在经历巨大痛苦的朋友，你看到了她的日记，你会读它吗？你知道，你会把它当作神圣的，不是吗？你想知道，也许你甚至不应该拿起它，但如果你拿起它，你会非常敬畏地对待它。好吧，这就是你在这里得到的。你得到了神儿子的祷告日记，是他为我们所受的痛苦和受难的第一人称表达。

现在，我们从中学到的很多，但今天我们只有时间，当我们准备去主的桌前时，看看我们从这篇诗篇，从他的祷告日记中学到的三件事，关于他来做什么。他首先来做仆人，其次来被憎恨，第三来被交换，做仆人，被憎恨，被交换。第一点最长，第二点最短，第三点最重要。

首先，他来做仆人。你知道，你注意到在第17节，他说，你为什么向你的仆人掩面？在段落的最开始，或者诗篇的最开始，他说，我下沉。救我，主啊，因为众水要淹没我。我陷在深淤泥中，没有立脚之地。耶稣来做什么？他来下沉，这是第一点。他来下沉。他来做仆人。这就是仆人做的，仆人下沉。

我们在礼拜中早些时候读了腓立比书2章。它完全是关于耶稣作为仆人来和下沉的意义。有一本新书现在很受欢迎，是一位牧师写的，叫《在伟大中下沉》，基于腓立比书2章。多年前，另一位牧师，一位著名的牧师叫唐纳德·格林·巴恩豪斯，过去常常这样开始他的讲道。上升的路是下降的。下降的路是上升的。而证明这种语言合理的是这个，正是这件事。腓立比书2章，诗篇69篇，圣经说，耶稣基督来是为了下沉，因为这就是仆人做的。

当你看腓立比书2章，你看到了。耶稣实际上向下迈了两大步。这就是做仆人的意义，向下走。他走了，我们被告知，从天到地。经上说，他虽然与神同等，却不坚持那同等，而是取了仆人的形象，成为人。你知道，当你想到道成肉身，神成为肉身，神成为人，你必须从你的脑海中排除。那些圣诞卡上可爱的小耶稣婴儿睡在干草上，看起来像象牙肥皂广告。我知道你必须理解，当你读诗篇69篇时你确实理解。你必须理解道成肉身的暴力。道成肉身对耶稣来说是一种暴力行为。他甘愿承受的暴力。暴力。

想一想。监狱有什么如此暴力的？什么是如此非人化和可怕的关于进监狱？你被剥夺了自由。你被剥夺了个人财产。几年前那件事有什么如此可怕的？我想它是在纽约地区，不是吗？有一个男人，因为他对一个年轻漂亮的模特生气，让人划破了她的脸，不是在纽约地区，那也很可怕。这是一个有着伟大美丽的人，被剥夺了她的美丽。

让我告诉你，道成肉身是有史以来最大的剥夺。这是万中选一的美者。这是美丽的神的儿子，他的美丽被从他身上撕走，他被投入这个身体。他的财富被从他身上撕走，他被投入贫穷。他与父的爱被从他身上撕走，他被投入孤独。他曾有的喜乐被从他身上撕走，他被投入悲伤，能力被从他身上撕走，他被投入软弱。你理解道成肉身的暴力吗？神成为人。那意味着什么？他在某一点成为一个细胞。

你知道，我们每次说他因圣灵感孕时都承认这一点。神成为宇宙中最弱小的生命形式。一个脆弱的形式，一个细胞。然后他成为一个婴儿。他全能的手，你看，现在无力地挥舞着。宇宙全能的主在弄脏自己时必须被换尿布。他不能自己换。道成肉身的暴力，他下沉了。他来是为了下沉。他不只是——腓立比书2章不仅告诉我们有一步向下。他迈了两步。他不仅从天来到地。但一旦他到达这里，他从马槽走向十字架。

他在地上的角色，他的工作，不是成为一个大政党的领袖并掌权。他的工作是被折磨和被杀死。那位在母腹中将我们编织在一起的，在十字架上被解构，被肢解。他下沉了。你知道，耶稣基督是世界对伟大的理解最明显、最直接、最大的矛盾。世界的理解是推销自己，以牺牲他人为代价推进你的事业。积累财富和权力。先顾自己。而耶稣，通过下降而上升，他教导我们的上升之路是下降之路。他教导我们通往权力的路是服侍。通往统治的路是顺服。失去生命的路，找到生命的路是失去你的生命。找到幸福的路不是寻求你的幸福，而是寻求他人的幸福。

你知道什么是基督徒吗？基督徒是一个人，与世界所有的智慧完全相反，决定把这作为你自己生命的模式来跟随。在我们继续之前，我只想让你想一想那个。如果你是基督徒，仆人当然不比他的主人大，那么你是伟大仆人的仆人，显然，这意味着你也决定了对我来说上升的路是下降。你决定了吗？你决定了我生命的本质是下沉吗？让我给你几个作为基督徒意味着什么的例子。

例如，最初的一步，基督徒作为基督徒所采取的最初的行动。换句话说，悔改本身。你能做的成为基督徒的第一件事是你通过在悔改中下降而上升到神面前。除非你下去，否则你不会上去。好吧，让我尽可能直接地说。我知道你们有些人在这里。我知道谁想说，是的，我犯了错误，我不完美，但你能对其他人和神说我是一个无助的罪人吗，我应该被抛弃，即使我是被神创造的，我却行事好像我是自己的创造者，即使神是我的王，我却行事好像我是自己的王，我应该被切断。我是一个无助的罪人，我需要一位救主和一位新的主人。你能那样说吗？

现在，这是纽约市，我知道有些人认为那是最原始的东西，最原始的宗教。多么倒退啊，你说，当然它是倒退的，它是一步向下。如果你觉得那太原始了，如果你不能那样说，那么你还不是仆人，你的理智上的骄傲阻止你下去，因此阻止你上来。我要给你另一个例子，做一个基督徒，你不断地在悔改中下去。做一个基督徒，你的生活水平也下降，让我在这方面非常实际。

圣经说，看看耶稣，他本是富足的，却为你们成了贫穷，叫你们因他的贫穷可以成为富足。圣经不断地说，基督徒是一个看到外面各种需要的人，你看到有需要的人，你看到各种重要的事业，你看到教会的工作，你看到用言语和行动帮助人的事工，在你成为基督徒之前，在你理解这个原则之前，在这种服侍的精神，在基督耶稣里的心思传递给你之前，你只给你负担得起的。

现在你知道你如何定义负担得起这个词吗？你的意思是，我只能给，只要我的给予不降低我生活中的实际生活水平，换句话说，我可以给，只要它不让我下去，只要它实际上不影响我今年夏天可以去哪里，只要它不影响我今晚有多少外出就餐的选择，只要它不改变我的生活水平。但那不是耶稣做的，耶稣的生活水平改变得相当剧烈。当你成为基督徒，你意识到你必须牺牲性地给，这意味着，哦，让我这样说，你是否如此慷慨地把你的钱送给人和事业，以至于你的生活水平在下降？如果没有，你还不是仆人，你对舒适的爱阻止你下去，因此阻止你上来。

你可能知道浪子的故事，但它不仅仅是关于一个任性的弟弟。事实上，耶稣讲这个故事是对那些逃离神的人和那些试图通过做好人来赚取他的爱的人说的。在他的书《挥霍的神》中，Tim Keller展示了这个众所周知的故事如何揭示福音的核心，这是一个对叛逆的弟弟和自以为义的哥哥都有希望的信息，也是邀请所有人经历神挥霍、奢侈恩典的邀请。

让我再给你一个例子。如果腓立比书2章说他取了虚己，成为没有名声的，一个人在你成为基督徒之前，在服侍的精神之前，在你理解下降之路是上升，上升之路是下降这个原则之前。帮助人，只要你得到感谢，只要你得到肯定，只要你得到一些认可，只要你得到一些拍拍后背，好的。这就是你如何区分一个出于自私服侍的人和一个真正的仆人不是为了回报。你取了虚己。你不是为了得到感谢，只是这样说。你需要很多感谢，你是否因为感到被认为理所当然而总是鼻子不高兴，你觉得人们没有认识到你付出了什么，似乎没有人知道你工作多么努力。我为这个教会鞠躬尽瘁，我得到什么感谢。

如果你有那种感觉，你还不是仆人，你对认可的需要阻止你下去，这样你才能上来。你看，神说的是，失去你的金钱，我会给你另一种财富。失去你的认可，我会给你另一种荣誉。失去你对保持控制的执着，我会给你另一种安全。失去你的生命，你就会找到它。他来是为了下沉，基督徒是知道下降之路是上升，上升之路是下降的人。

第二，他来是为了被憎恨。现在，记住，正如我对你提到的，他在新约中引用了这节经文。虽然他没有引用前几节。很明显他在看这一切，他在想着自己。这是他的语言，这是他的心，但他引用第4节说，无故恨我的，比我头发还多，无理与我为仇的，甚是强盛。我在这一点上会非常简短，我警告过你，但这很重要。

耶稣在新约中指出，人们会自动无故地恨他。他们会非理性地恨他，因为他是圣洁的。人心中有一些东西害怕真正的圣洁。我们知道，几年前有一部电影出来，是关于一场战争的，是关于一个人决定说出在越南发生的真相，即使这会危及他的生命，即使这会毁掉他的事业，即使这会对他的生活产生巨大影响，他还是那样做了。在纽约时报这里的影评家，文森特·坎比指出这一点。他说，这种无私的道德信念总是使一个人成为贱民，因为这种灵魂的纯洁对我们来说是完全可怕的。

他的意思是，我们心中有一个自我辩护的引擎，我们不断说服自己我们没问题的方式是，当我们接近一个显示出我们自己缺陷的圣洁标准时，我们要么逃离它，要么贬低它。我们要么贬低它，要么逃跑。对任何人来说都是如此，任何过着正直生活、服侍生活的人。现在当耶稣出现时，他的标准是如此崇高和高尚，他们无故地恨他。他有无数的敌人，但我告诉你，如果你和我要跟随耶稣，如果你和我要成为仆人，那总是仆人的标志。仆人总是会被无故地恨。他会被恨的几个例子。

我的一个朋友多年前是一名警察，在美国一个大城市当警察。他成为了基督徒。他对某件事有困难，那就是管区里的皮条客会进来给警长很多钱，警长会分给所有警官，这样他们就不会去抓那些给钱的妓女。我朋友成为基督徒后，他决定他不想要那笔钱，有一次一个人来找他说，嘿，你最好开始拿那笔钱。他们不喜欢你似乎觉得你比我们其他人更纯洁的事实，你最好拿那笔钱，否则下次你需要支援时，可能来得很慢。

我记得和一个家庭谈话，那时我住在费城，当第一个黑人家庭搬进他们的白人社区时。他们作为基督徒、朋友过去带了一些派并问候他们，之后他们被社区里其他白人家庭绝对地诽谤和攻击，他们说，我的房子是我唯一拥有的东西。如果那些人开始搬进来，它会贬值，你会毁了我。你怎么能这样对我？

有一个人曾经来找我说，他成为基督徒后，如果我开始如实申报我的收入并开始支付我真正欠的税款，我所有其他同事也会被国税局盯上。我该怎么办？我能告诉你的只是这些人做了什么，但我能告诉你的是这个，正常的仆人身份，正常的道德生活会给你带来无故的仇恨。正常的人类生活，正常的道德行为，正常的基督徒生活会暴露社区里的种族主义，会暴露工作中的不诚实，会暴露办公室的八卦，会暴露派对上的滥交，你会被无故地恨，是你还是你只是融入你的环境？有人无故恨你吗？那么你没有跟随耶稣，因为仆人下沉，仆人被无故地恨。

第三，最重要的是，耶稣基督不只是来做仆人和被憎恨，从某种意义上说，这是他作为仆人来的一般要旨，但他非常具体地来是为了被交换。让我这样说，在第九节，现在大卫，写这首诗的人，非常困惑。他看不到我们能看到的，他不能通过耶稣来读他自己的经历。在第九节，他说，因我为你的殿心里焦急，如同火烧，并且辱骂你人的辱骂都落在我身上。

现在大卫很困惑。他说，就像我在第17节提到的，他说，你怎么能让你的仆人，你怎么能向你的仆人掩面？我做的一切都是对的，我是一个模范仆人，我爱你，我对你忠诚。我为你的殿心里焦急。为什么你让我无辜地受苦？或者让我这样说，他说，因我为你的殿心里焦急。然后他说，辱骂你人的辱骂都落在我身上。我不应得的东西落在我身上。怎么会这样，大卫说？

耶稣说，这就是我来做的。但我不应得的东西落在我身上。以赛亚用这些话谈到受苦的仆人。他在以赛亚书52和53章简单地说，看哪，我的仆人行事必有智慧，但耶和华却喜悦将他压伤，使他受苦。耶和华以他为赎罪祭，他受苦的结果他必看见就心满意足。

和我一起听一会儿。和我一起想。这是替代的教义。每当我让我的一个儿子收拾东西时，你知道，这里乱七八糟，收拾一下。如果碰巧我的儿子是弄乱的那个人，他通常会不情愿地站起来，慢慢开始做。但如果，对我来说是祸了，如果我让某个儿子收拾实际上是由其他某个儿子的过失和罪造成的乱。在那种情况下，儿子会说，那不是我的错。为什么我要为别人的过失承担后果？为什么我要以替代的方式为别人的过失和罪受苦？收拾这个。

这是一种本能。这正是你心里所说的。啊，有人说，你知道，因为各种原因，因为各种过失，那个人的过失，他家庭的过失，系统的过失，城市的过失，我们现在非常需要很多戒毒康复中心。我们需要无家可归者康复中心。我们需要把它们放在你的社区，态度是什么？态度是什么？为什么我要为别人的罪承担后果？为什么我要为别人的过失以替代的方式受苦？那是本能。那就是我们总是的感觉。

但那不是仆人的心如何运作的。让我告诉你仆人的心如何运作。仆人说，我知道这不是我的错。但某人必须承担后果。某人必须付出代价。所以我会做。我会承担后果。我会付出代价。我会以替代的方式受苦。

现在，你明白为什么耶稣是最伟大的仆人吗？因为他不只是做了一点。他为世界的罪承担了后果。他为每个人的罪以替代的方式受苦。这就是这里所描绘的。他承担了最大的后果。他承担了最大的重担。他承担了最不可思议的债务。这就是为什么当他读那些话，父啊，你为什么向你的仆人掩面？他知道答案。

因为当他在十字架上说，为什么你向你的仆人掩面？我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？父神转离了他。父说，儿子，你知道我为什么必须这样对你。因为我们从永恒就同意这样做。不，我为什么向你掩面？因为必须落在你身上。都会落在你身上。

在你的想象中，看着他。然后读诗篇69篇。看着他在那上面。血从他脸上流下来。他的眼睛因被打而肿胀闭合。他的背因鞭打而撕裂。他在十字架上窒息，然后读。我寻找同情，却没有找到。我寻找安慰者，却找不着。我的心破碎了，没有人来包扎。它落在他身上。

你们有些人在那里，你们难道没有看到吗。听着，这是你们中一些做过可怕事情的人。但你难道没有看到任何人都有希望吗。可能有人在这里。这是纽约市。可能有人在这里杀过人。有些人在这里做过一些可怕的事情，你们恨自己。在某个深层，你在说没有什么能帮助我。我应该被唾弃。我应该被打。我应该被定罪。你看到了吗？你终于看到了吗？它落在他身上。

换句话说，如果你相信耶稣基督，你已经被打了。你是对的，但你已经被打了。你是对的，但你已经被唾弃了。你是对的，但你已经被定罪了。你们中有很多人没有做过那么可怕的事情。你难道没有看到你们生活中发生了什么吗？看看你们自己。你为什么工作那么努力？你为什么拼命地工作？为什么你的生活中有这种疯狂试图证明自己？或者为什么你的生活中有这种暴躁和易怒试图为自己辩护？

你难道没有看到吗？停止它！它已经被付清了。停止试图为它付款。它落在你身上。主耶稣，这样说。它落在你身上，主耶稣，为我。让我们这样结束。你难道没有看到圣经教导的奇妙之处吗？耶稣基督不只是作为神的仆人来。不，他不只是作为服侍神的榜样来。如果他只是那样，哦，我们会有如此大的麻烦。我们会看着他，我们会生他的气。我们会逃离他。我们会无故地恨他。但相反，他为我下沉了。为你，他为我们下沉了。他为我们被憎恨。他为我们被交换。他来实际上服侍和等候我们。

路加福音中说，耶稣讲了这个关于他自己的比喻。他在路加福音中说，主人来的时候，看见仆人警醒，那仆人就有福了。他要束上带子，叫他们坐席，自己前来伺候他们。你知道那意味着什么吗？在末日，如果他发现你在服侍他，在末日，他要束上带子。束上带子意味着撩起你的袍子塞在腰带里，这样你可以集中注意力。他要束上带子。他要聚集他无限全能力量的所有无穷和浩大，他要把它们全部用来服侍你，医治你，爱你，满足你，尊荣你。那仆人就有福了。你准备好那一天了吗？

如果明天是那一天，你会是那些仆人之一吗？不要忘记做一个真正的仆人。不是一个试图通过你的服侍来拯救他或她自己的人？因为真正仆人的第一个行为是说，因为只有爱我接受我因为它落在你身上。我是一个罪人。我不能通过我的服侍来拯救自己。服侍的第一个行为是说接受我因为，哦主耶稣，它都落在你身上。

饼和杯。当你拿到饼时，它会被掰开。当你吃的时候，你会掰开它更多。听听它说什么。它说，你知道我为什么被掰开吗？你知道我为什么被离弃吗？你知道我父为什么掩面，以便它能为你落在我身上吗？

让我们祷告。父啊，我们祈求当我们拿饼和杯时，我们可以下降以便上来。我们祈求我们可以学习你儿子为我们死并为我们受苦的意义。我们越想到这一点，当我们拿饼和杯时，也使我们成为仆人。男人和女人，他们会在银行账户上下降，在认可上下降，在世人眼中的地位上下降，在悔改中下降，但他们会找到一种新的荣誉，一种新的财富，一种新的喜乐。父啊，当我们拿饼和杯时，在我们里面做这一切。我们奉耶稣的名祷告，阿门。
