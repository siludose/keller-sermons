### Introduction: The Human Condition

You don't have to look far to see that something's deeply wrong with our world and with us. But is there an answer that gets to the root of why? In today's message, Tim Keller explores the human condition through stories in the Bible, uncovering what Scripture says about sin and why it's the only explanation deep enough to face the truth about ourselves.

Let me read to you the teaching, Scripture passage, the passage on which the teaching is based this morning. It's found in your bulletins. It's Genesis 39 and I'm reading from verses 4 to 21. The story of Joseph, Genesis 39, verses 4 to 21.

### The Story of Joseph

Joseph found favor in his eyes, that's referring to his master, Potiphar, a high official in the Pharaoh's court. Joseph found favor in his eyes and became his attendant. Potiphar put him in charge of his household, and he entrusted to his care everything he owned. From the time he put him in charge of his household, of all that he owned, the Lord blessed the household of the Egyptian because of Joseph. The blessing of the Lord was on everything Potiphar had, both in the house and in the field. So he left in Joseph's care everything he had with Joseph in charge. He did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate. Now Joseph was well-built and handsome.

And after a while, his master's wife took notice of Joseph and said, come to bed with me, but he refused. With me in charge, he told her my master does not concern himself with anything in the house. Everything he owns, he has entrusted to my care. No one is greater in this house than I am. My master is withheld nothing for me except you because you are his wife. How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God? And though he spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her or even be with her.

One day he went into the house to attend to his duties and none of the household's servants was inside. She caught him by his cloak and said, come to bed with me, but he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house. When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run out of the house, she called her household's servants, look she said to them, this Hebrew has been brought to us to make sport of us. He came in here to sleep with me, but I screamed. And when he heard me scream for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.

She kept his cloak beside her until his master came home. Then she said to him this story, that Hebrew's slave you brought us came to me to make sport of me, but as soon as I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house. And when his master heard the story, his wife told him saying, this is how your slave treated me, he burned with anger. Joseph's master took him and put him in prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined. But while Joseph was there in the prison, the Lord was with him. He showed him kindness and granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden.

This is God's Word.

### Understanding Lust

Well, we've been going through the seven deadly sins and finally we get to one that's interesting. Joseph's career was going along fairly well. He'd been sold into the servanthood by his brothers, but he had been bought by this high official in the society of Egypt and because he was such an incredibly good manager, he rose soon to be in a sense the COO, the chief operating officer of this huge estate. His career was going very well. This is a lot like a lot of people in New York that I know. His career was going very well and then sex came and sex will come and it's such a powerful force that how you deal with it can make or break you.

Haven't you been reading all the chastened, cautious books and articles coming out about sex in the last actually five, almost 10 years. A senior editor of the Old Look magazine years ago was a he was really a proponent of what was then called sexual liberation in the late 60s and early 70s. In the 80s he came out with a book called The End of Sex and in it he was so chastened he said in there, I've finally come to see that every game has the rules and sex has rules and that unless you play by the rules you'll find that sex can create a depth of loneliness that nothing else can. Isn't ironic. Sex creating loneliness.

So it's such that you see your things may be going very well but sex will come. Joseph, everything's going fine. Sex came. He wasn't even looking for it but it came. It came at him. How you handle it will have a lot to say about how your life goes.

Now, what do we learn from this passage about it? At the seven deadly sins, this one is called, we're going to call it lust and I'll get to that word in a second. But the thing that we learn here is we learn something from what we see Potiphar's wife doing and we learn something from what we see Joseph doing and we learn something from what we see God doing and from Potiphar's wife we learned how to understand lust and from Joseph we understand we learn how to handle lust and from God we learn how to heal lust, how to understand it, how to handle it, how to heal it.

Let's look, first of all when we see, you see with Joseph and Potiphar's wife we actually have two different cases. I call it the case of Joseph. Well, but in a sense there's two cases here. Two cases of how sex sexuality lust is treated and so we have a good and a bad example. And with Potiphar's wife, when we see how things operate, we learn something about how we learn to understand what lust is.

Now, some people are going to be kind of unhappy about me using the word lust. When Jimmy Carter talked about lust, poor Jimmy Carter. He said something. I didn't confess that sometimes he'd look at a woman with lust in his heart and I can still remember Dan Ackroy took three months of jokes at Jimmy Carter's expense on Saturday Night Live making fun of that. And some people would say even the word lust harkens back to regressive, repressive Victorian attitudes towards sex and it can. And usually the word lust in the Bible is not used with reference to sex. But we can't try to be more wise than Jesus. And Jesus himself said, if you look on someone with lust, you've committed adultery in your heart. So let's not be wise than Jesus.

The word lust in the Bible usually is not got anything to do with sex and the word lust means a desire that's out of order. A desire that's out of order. What do we learn then about sexual lust, about sexual desire? We see, first of all, that Potiphar's wife noticed Joseph. Now, you know, unfortunately, the English word notice is a little too weak here. The fact of the matter is to notice somebody's physically beautiful, that's not lust. But that's also not what Potiphar's wife did. Literally in Hebrew, it says she lifted up her eyes to him. And it means to contemplate. She contemplated his beauty. It says literally, he says he was beautiful of form and beautiful of face. He had a great body and a great beautiful face. And she contemplated that. And then we see that she had spent so much time contemplating she had gone to bed with him so often in her mind that finally, in spite of the dangers and in spite of his refusal, she had to go to bed with him in reality. And so she tried. But finally we see, when he refused again and again and again, when she realized she could not have him, she turned murderous and tried to kill him. And you say, where is that? Well, what she was accusing him of was a capital offense. And we'll get to that later.

What do we learn about lust? Okay, first of all, a negative and then the positive. Negatively, lust is not sexual desire per se. Joseph does not say this is a wicked thing because it's sexual. He doesn't say that. We'll see what he says in a second. He doesn't say it's a sin because it's sexual. The Bible never anywhere says sexual desire per se is lust. Sexual desire is wrong in itself. Sexual desire is bad polluting, defiling in itself, not at all. The Bible, as we're going to see, has one of the most glorious views of sex. In fact, I'll be very happy to say the Bible has the most exalted view of sex of any other holy book or any other religion anywhere in the world. I don't mind taking it on than that.

In Genesis 2, God makes male and female. And when He creates sexuality, we're told He looked at it and right away He says it's good. And He tells them to be fruitful. Okay? We see in the Old Testament, in fact, we preached on this last year, in Proverbs 5, husbands and wives are commanded to be ravished with each other sexually. In the New Testament, in 1 Corinthians 7, the same thing is told to them. Husbands and wives are commanded to have their commanded to consciously cultivate sexual desire for each other. The song of solemn is a joyous and graphic celebration of sexual love.

And traditionally in history, when the seven deadly sins have been looked at, lust is never at the top. It's way down the list. Let me show you what I mean. Pride, envy, greed, wrath, all of them have always been further up the list. Those things have always been worse since. Why? Because the moral theologians of the Christian church have always known that pride, greed, to want to hurt somebody, to want to steal from somebody, to want to put yourself in the center and trample on other people. That is not what the heart was built for. Those are unnatural desires, unnatural. You weren't built to steal, you weren't built to hurt, you weren't built to hate, you weren't built to kill, but you were built for sexual desire. And that's the reason why see sexual lust, as we're going to see what it is, is a natural desire going wrong.

That's the reason why Jesus, do you realize what an affirmation of sexuality it was when Jesus said to the moral and religious leaders of the time, to the religious leaders, be proud, envious, greedy religious leaders, he said to them, the prostitutes and the pimps are closer to the kingdom of heaven than you. That is an affirmation. Sexuality, per se, intense sexual desire per se is not only not wrong, but it's commanded in situations. So the idea that lust is any kind of sexual passion, that's just not true at all.

Well, then what is sexual desire? How does it become lust? And I'm going to say, from the passage we see lust is three things, three ways to understand it. First of all, lust is desiring out of control. I'll be real brief on that. Look at what the poor lady, once she's in the grip of her sexual passion, even though he's given her a very firm know. And not only that, even though what she's trying to do is very dangerous to her personally, she can't stop. After day in, day out.

Now people will tell us that sex is just an appetite. And so like any other appetite, and when you get hungry, you should eat, and when you feel sexy, you should have sex. And it's just an appetite and it's fine, and nobody should think there's anything wrong with their appetites. Really? Really? There's no other appetite that I know that gets as obsessive as this so quickly. And of course, there's that writer who pointed this out, if you ever found a country where when young guys go off to college, they put these posters up of hamburgers and hot dogs all over their wall, and everybody, they all went running from room to room to look at them. And if you found a country where people paid money to watch someone slowly uncover cakes and pies, you would assume that that country was filled with starving people, and then you would be astonished to say, not only aren't they starving, but the more they eat, the more they do this. That's an appetite out of order. There's something wrong. It's not just an appetite. You can't trust an appetite like that.

So first of all, lust is desiring out of control. It's out of control. Secondly though, and more importantly, lust is desiring pleasure without a promise. Lust is desiring pleasure without a promise. It's not just desiring pleasure. We said, that's fine. First of all, it's desiring out of order, and then secondly, it's desiring pleasure out of control. Secondly, desiring pleasure without a promise.

Now, what does Joseph say to her is wrong about this? You are his wife. And if we only saw this passage and we knew nothing else about the Bible, if we knew no other parts of the Bible said anything about sex or adultery or anything else, we might assume that what he was saying was the real problem was only that she was married to him. And if she wasn't married and he wasn't married, it'd be all right. But we know from the Old New Testament that that's not what he was thinking, only. He was actually saying, when he said, you are not his wife, you are his wife, he was also saying, you're not mine. That's the problem. See, that's it. One's implied in the other.

The Old Testament and the New Testament are crystal clear about this. Sex is designed only in all ways between one man and one woman in a complete exclusive and permanent commitment called marriage. It's only in all ways between one man, one woman in a complete exclusive and permanent commitment called marriage. It doesn't matter if one person happens to be married to somebody else. If they're not married to each other, see, that's what Joseph is saying. Joseph is not just simply saying the fact that she's married means because you're married to him that that makes this thing wicked. What makes it wicked is not that it's sexual, but that we're not married. You're not my wife.

Now, why would the Bible say such a thing? And here's the reason why. You might believe that there's no purpose for sex. Sex is just something that happened. Sex is an accident. It's an accident of evolution. You're an accident. We're all accidents. There's no rhyme or reason. Nope. Your reason, your perception, your memory, your creativity, your sexuality, all the things about you made believe that these things are accidents. And so they were not designed by anyone for a purpose. Now, if you believe that, of course, you're not going to like what I'm about to say, but you also have a lot more troubles, a whole lot more troubles. I mean, you might have a license for sexual freedom, but there's no meaning in your life. You have no right to call anything right or wrong. You know, we have other problems, far more problems. I mean, if you decide, I want a meaningless existence so that I can have sex, you've bitten off a lot more than you can chew.

The Bible says the reason that sex is only for marriage is because sex was designed for two purposes. Sex is a tell us. Sex is tell us. Sex has a design, a purpose, a goal, two, two purposes. And when Joseph says we're not married, he's thinking of the first of the goal. Say the two goals of sex. One is the penultimate goal and one is the ultimate goal. And what Joseph is bringing out right here when he says we're not married, he's bringing out the penultimate goal of sex. God intended sex, he invented sex, as both a sign of and a means of achieving complete life unity between two people. God created sex to be a way of not only to be a sign. In other words, a means of expressing and a means of achieving and renewing complete life unity between two people.

This should be common sense but sin blinds us to it. Here's what I mean. The physical union should be a sign of union in every other realm. I mean, that's absolute logic. That's common sense. That's spiritual. It makes sense. It's beautiful. The Bible says you must not act out something physically, which is not also true, spiritually, personally, socially, legally, every other way. When Paul, you want to understand the Biblical sex ethic, you have to see Paul saying in 1 Corinthians 6, he says, don't sleep with a prostitute. He says, don't you know that whoever you sleep with, you become one with.

Now, do you understand the logic there? Here's what he's saying. It makes perfect sense. In order to be physically one with somebody, in order to have sex with somebody, you've got to be naked. And to be naked means you get so vulnerable. Not only do people see you, the other person sees you as you are, but more than that, there is no less defensive physical posture than sexual postures. When you're having sex, you are utterly vulnerable. You have no weapons. This is the reason why sexual violence is considered by everybody, intuitively, a moral evil, a moral outrage, because when you're having sex, you are absolutely vulnerable. You could be utterly attacked, especially by the person you're having sex with, but you're totally attacked. You're completely vulnerable because you're one. To become one, you lose your physical independence. You're not able to suddenly make moves. You're not able to act independently. You see? Not a good time to have a battle. Not a good time to defend yourself.

Well, the Bible says, Paul says, the Bible says, think what happens physically should be also happening in every other realm. The Bible says, the sex is God's designed way to say to somebody else. I belong completely, exclusively, and permanently to you.

Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache. We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way? And what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing this month, what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer.

Now if you say that and then say I don't want to marry you, you're talking to two sides of your mouth. You can't be completely exclusively and permanently committed to somebody unless you're married. When you're physically one, you become vulnerable. But when a person says I want to have sex with you, but I do not want to be married to you what they're saying is I don't want to be so bound up emotionally. I don't want to be so bound up legally. I don't want to be so bound up socially. I don't want to be so bound up with you that I can't make my own decisions. I want to be vulnerable to you physically but not spiritually. Here's what you're saying. I want your body but not you. I want to give you my body but I don't want to give you me. You talk about unnatural. The Christian sex ethic is utterly natural. It holds body and soul together and any other ethic destroys them. It pulls them apart.

C.S. Lewis was amazing when he said to have sex without being married, to want pleasure without a promise, to want pleasure without a commitment is like trying to taste and eat food and then vomit it up. Let me tell you how profound that illustration is even though it's a daring one. He says a person who wants to taste food but you don't want it to become part of you, you don't want the commitment that's entailed with eating. You don't want the consequences of eating. You don't want the ramifications. You want all the pleasure but you don't want any of the responsibility. You don't want to become part of you. We know what happens if you try to do that. It's called bulimia and it ravages you physically. It's utterly unnatural to separate tasting from digestion. And Lewis has the right to go around and say don't you understand, it's just as unnatural to abstract physical union from every other kind. Just say I want to pleasure without a purpose. It will ravage you spiritually. Sex is a way for you to say to somebody, I belong to you. It's not only a sign of the fact that you're already totally committed. I belong to you. You belong to me. You're not your own. I'm not my own. We're one. That's what marriage is. And if you say I want that physically but I don't want any other way, what God has joined together, let no one put a center. And that is utterly natural.

And you see, therefore, let's see how Joseph handles it. Therefore, lust is not just desiring pleasure out of control. And lust is not just desiring pleasure without a promise. It's actually desiring pleasure without a person. Yes. Lust is the opposite of love. Love, you want a person. In lust, you just want the pleasure. And the person is a necessary commodity to get there. In love, you want a person. And if you have to forego pleasure, fine. It's the person that's non-negotiable. The pleasure that's negotiable. In lust, it's the pleasure that's non-negotiable. And the person that's negotiable, how do you see it? Look at what happened to her. Look what happened to Potiphar's wife when she realized he had spurned her. She wanted the affirmation. She wanted the experience. And when she saw she couldn't have him, she turned murderous. And it's not just when you can't get the person that you really see that what you thought was love was really lust because it turns murderous. Sometimes, even when you get the person, in 2nd Samuel 13, there's an amazing story about David's son, Amon. And Amon slept with his half-sister, Tamar. He got her to bed. He seduced her. Incessed. We're told that before he seduced her, he was sick with love. But if you ever read that, it's in 2nd Samuel 13. It's an amazing passage. As soon as he had done consummating sex, it said suddenly, he hated her with a hatred that was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And he got up and said, arise and go. What had happened? Lust is one pleasure without a person. Lust is getting incredibly in love with somebody you don't even know. All you see is what you think they can give you. You don't even know them. You have no idea who they are. In other words, sin takes lust. A good thing, sexual desire, and sin turns sexual desire into lust because it makes sexual desire and end in itself instead of a way of serving somebody. And through which you can learn the incredible pleasure of giving pleasure. Instead of learning the pleasure of giving pleasure, instead of using sex as a way to serve somebody else, serving somebody you're committed to, somebody you're trying to give pleasure to instead becomes an end in itself and a person just happens to be a necessary commodity. So we can discard the people. And we do. As time goes on, as long as we have the thing.

### Handling Lust

Now how does Joseph handle it? He teaches us something pretty remarkable. As you can see, sin makes sexual desire a very powerful thing. Well, how does he handle it? He handles it like this. First of all, well, there's two things he does. One is pretty obvious. One is not so obvious. One is he controls his actions. You notice it says he would refuse to be with her. You see that? He says not only refuse to go to bed, whether he refused to be with her, he stayed away from her. He stayed away from temptation. We talked to him about that last week. But the other thing he did, he didn't just control his actions, he controlled his thoughts.

James Fix, the guy who wrote the complete book of running, there's a fascinating place in that book in which he says, the hardest thing about running, Amerathons, is your mind. He found in the early stages of becoming a marathon runner, that what will happen in the midst of the marathon is the fatigue will be so great that your mind will say, why did you ever start this race? What was it that attracted you to distance running? And James Fix said, I would find that I had no answer. I couldn't remember why I wanted to. He says, one time he dropped right out of a marathon because your brain plays tricks on you, he says, when the heat's on. And the brain will suddenly, he will just decide to forget the reasons that you love running, the great benefits of running in general for you, the great benefits of this race and you just can't even remember it. So he said, he learned that one of the most important things to do, if you're going to stick with that marathon through the hard time, he says, beforehand, you've got to practically memorize the reasons you love running. Memorize the reasons is an important race. Memorize the reason so you can tell your brain that. But he says, you know, if things really get bad and you can't remember everything, you know what he says? He says, the final thing I used to trick, I used to play on my brain as I'd say, well, I know when I get there, I'll remember it. I know I had a good reason to start. And when I get there, I'll remember it.

Now there's a lot of wisdom in this and this is what Joseph does. Joseph says, how can I then do this wicked thing and sin against God? Now there it is. Now, he says two things to himself. First of all, he says, how can I then do this wicked thing? Now then it refers to the fact that we're not married. And so what he's doing is he's reminding himself of the penultimate purpose of marriage. And the penultimate purpose of marriage is absolute union of body and soul, not pulling them apart, but keeping them together. And so what does he do? He says to himself, I will not be a monstrosity. I will not ravage myself. I will not that which God has joined together. I will not put a sunder. But I suppose if Joseph was completely blanking out, here's what you can say, by the way, if you totally blank out, you say, look, no sex outside marriage. This is the one thing that for 2,000 years, every branch of the Christian Church has agreed on orthodox Catholic and Protestant. Jewish Judaism, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, all of these centuries of these great religions who disagree on so many other things they all agree with this. They all believe this. The only people who don't believe it is something, this is just a belief that just come up very recently and very, very small little bubble pockets of people, you know, like Manhattan. And so what you have to say is, I know there's a good reason, I just can't remember when I get there, when I get to the finish line, it'll all come back.

That's not the only thing he says. He remembers, he fills his mind with the penultimate goal, but he also fills his mind with the ultimate goal. He says, how can I do this thing and sin against God? Now, how could this be a sin against God? Now, it could be a sin against Potiphar, the husband, yeah, it could be a sin against Potiphar's wife. It wouldn't be that hard to say if he had given into her in the midst of her passion that she was giving in, he was sending against her. He certainly could say he was sending against himself in his own body, but how God? And here's the reason, because I told you there were two goals for sex and this is the ultimate goal. And the ultimate goal of sex is to be an appetizer and a sign of the absolute ecstasy and joy of complete union with God. Sex is a sign and an api-biblical, according to biblical theology, sex is a foretaste and a sign and a signpost pointing toward the unbelievable joy and ecstasy of complete union with God.

In Ephesians 5, the New Testament says, that when a husband and wife unite, it's a great mystery, but it tells us, it shows us Christ uniting with His people. In Romans 7, Paul is so explicit. He says, just as a husband and wife get into each other's arms and through sexual union, fruit is born into the world through the woman's body. So when Christ and the believer are in each other's arms, Christ's fruit is born into the world through you unbelievable, it's what the Bible says. Sex is a foretaste of that. When sex is the best possible here, what do you want? What do you get? You want somebody to see you completely and not just tolerate it. See you naked, not just tolerate it, but you want to see their delight in you. As they see you, you want to see in their eyes them looking at you as if you are holy and without blemish. This is the reason we look in mirrors. This is the reason a lot of people don't want to have sex or get married. You're afraid of what people are going to see. You can cover it up. There's always cosmetics. There's all sorts of ways of covering up, but here the idea that somebody will see you, what you really want in sex, if somebody see you and know you completely and then delight in you as if you were holy and without blemish. Then you want somebody's arms to come around you and give you a cradle of absolute security for your moment of absolute vulnerability and you want to do the same. You know what? Nobody can do that.

What's funny is when sex is going well and when love is going well, the only way we can talk about it is in religious language. This is the sexual proof of the existence of God that sex, love, makes you talk about things that aren't true. You start to say, I will love you forever. You know, even the great, even the drippy songs. They go on and on. They say longer than there have been fishes in the ocean, higher than any bird ever flew, longer than there have been stars up in the heaven. I've been in love with you. And we go, oh, why? Because your sexuality is pointing to the eternal. Even when you think you've got it, you don't have it. It's an illusion. Your sexual desire once a kind of cosmic closure that no one here on Earth can give you. Nobody can love you like that. Nobody will ever be able to truly say, I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever forsake you. Because people die. People are sinners. Nobody can look at you and see you holding without blemish, except one who does say, I will never leave you and ever forsake you. Who does say, in my sight, you are holding without blemish because I've died for you and I've closed you with my own righteousness. I've decked you with jewels. You know, it's a great sin against God to try to get closure out of somebody else that only God can give. And so Christians are able to demystify sex. And that's what he was doing. A Christian is somebody who says, this is a sin, if my sexual desire is rather a controlist because I'm trying to get closure out of somebody who can never give it to me, I'm going to demote it. Sex is a great thing. I hope I will have a wonderful sex life someday. But if I let this drive me, I'm trying to get something that it can never give. Trying to get something out of it can never give. Self-control comes not by thinking of sex who negatively. Christian self-control comes by thinking of sex gloriously, that it puts it in a sense in its place here and now.

What God does, if you're obedient, like Joseph, what does it say? Verse 21, God was with him. If you're obedient like Joseph, you're going to experience rejection. You're going to experience temporary isolation. You're going to have people laugh at you just like Joseph. But you know what? Potiphar must have actually trusted, he must have at least doubted, Joseph integrity must have been so incredibly good that when his wife came and accused him, there must have been doubts in Potiphar's mind because what he was accused of was a capital offense. We know that. And so Potiphar must have had doubts. His integrity was so great that it saved him even at a moment like that. God was with him and he'll be with you.

But what, I know somebody's asking, what if Joseph's not really my model? What if I'm a lot more like Potiphar's wife? What does Jesus say to me? He says the same thing to you that he said to the woman caught an adultery. He stood there before her and what did he say to her? He wouldn't cast a stone. Why? He said to her, go and sin no more. Neither do I condemn thee. And you know what's so amazing? When he said that, first of all, he called sin sin. He said, don't sin anymore. He didn't say it wasn't a sin. Sexual sin is sin. But then he said, neither do I condemn thee. Wait. If you say someone's guilty, then you have to condemn them. And if you say they're not condemned, then they must, they must not be guilty. Jesus says, you're guilty and I don't condemn you. How could he say that? I know why. Do you know what was going on in his mind when he was saying that? He was saying, my dear sister, you're guilty. But there's no condemnation for you because I'm not throwing a stone at you because I'm going to take the stones that should come to you. I'm going to take the spear. I'm going to take the thorns. I'm going to take the fever and the bloody sweat so that in yours, in my sight and in my father's sight, you can be holy and blameless.

If you receive Christ, one of the greatest things that happens in the genealogies of Matthew, Matthew chapter 1, verse 1, and following, it gives you the family tree of the Messiah and in the family tree of the Messiah is Tamar. Tamar, the incest victim, Bathsheba, the adulteress, Rahab, the prostitute, Mary, a single unwed mother. What are they doing in the family tree? Jesus Christ says, I'm proud of you. I don't care what you've done. I don't care what you've done. If you receive me, I'm proud of you. Go and send no more. Neither do I condemn me. If you name your sin, he will say peace to you. But if you say peace to yourself, he will name your sin. That's how it works. Come to him, let's pray.

Our father, we ask that you would make us so aware of the glorious nature of this sexual nature that you've given us, that we might find ourselves in wonderful self-control. Teach us how to understand, how to handle, and how to be healed. In those aspects of our sexuality where we are wounded and broken, because of your son, who said, neither do I condemn thee. Go and send no more. And Jesus, name we pray. Amen.

### 引言：人类的状况

你不需要走得太远就能看到我们的世界和我们自身存在着深刻的问题。但是否有一个答案能触及问题的根源？在今天的信息中，Tim Keller 通过圣经中的故事探讨人类的状况，揭示圣经对罪的看法，以及为什么它是唯一能够深刻面对我们自身真相的解释。

让我为你读一下今天的教导经文，这段经文是今天教导的基础。它在你的公告中找得到。是创世记 39 章，我将从第 4 节读到第 21 节。约瑟的故事，创世记 39 章，第 4 节到第 21 节。

### 约瑟的故事

约瑟在他主人的眼中蒙恩，这指的是他的主人波提乏，法老宫廷中的一位高官。约瑟在他眼中蒙恩，成为他的侍从。波提乏把他家里的一切交给他管理，并把他所拥有的一切都托付给他。从他把他家里的一切交给他管理的那时起，耶和华因约瑟的缘故赐福给埃及人的家。耶和华的祝福临到波提乏家里的一切，无论是在家里还是在田间。因此，他把他所拥有的一切都交给约瑟管理，除了他所吃的食物，他什么都不关心。现在约瑟身材魁梧，容貌俊美。

过了一段时间，他主人的妻子注意到了约瑟，并说，跟我上床吧，但他拒绝了。他对她说，我的主人不关心家里的任何事情。他所拥有的一切都托付给我。这个家里没有人比我更大。我主人没有留给我任何东西，除了你，因为你是他的妻子。那么我怎么能做这样邪恶的事，得罪神呢？尽管她天天对约瑟说话，他还是拒绝与她同床，甚至不愿与她在一起。

有一天，他进屋去做他的工作，家里的仆人都不在里面。她抓住他的外衣说，跟我上床吧，但他把外衣留在她手里，跑出了屋子。当她看到他把外衣留在她手里，跑出屋子时，她叫来家里的仆人，说，看，她对他们说，这个希伯来人被带到我们这里来戏弄我们。他进来这里想与我同寝，但我尖叫。当他听到我求救的尖叫声时，他把外衣留在我旁边，跑出屋子。

她把他的外衣留在她身边，直到他的主人回家。然后她对他说这个故事，你带来的那个希伯来奴隶来戏弄我，但当我尖叫求救时，他把外衣留在我旁边，跑出屋子。当他的主人听到他妻子对他说的故事时，说，这就是你的奴隶对我做的，他怒火中烧。约瑟的主人把他抓住，关进监狱，就是关押王的囚犯的地方。但当约瑟在那里时，耶和华与他同在。他对他施恩，并在监狱长的眼中赐他恩宠。

这是神的话。

### 理解情欲

我们一直在讨论七宗罪，终于我们谈到一个有趣的。约瑟的事业进展得相当顺利。他被兄弟们卖为奴隶，但被埃及社会的一位高官买下，因为他是一个非常出色的管理者，他很快就升到了这个巨大庄园的首席运营官。他的事业进展得非常顺利。这就像我认识的很多纽约人一样。他的事业进展得非常顺利，然后性来了，性会来，它是如此强大的力量，你如何处理它可以成就或毁掉你。

你难道没有读过过去五年，甚至十年间关于性的谨慎、警惕的书籍和文章吗？多年前，《旧视界》杂志的一位高级编辑，他曾是上世纪60年代末和70年代初所谓性解放的倡导者。在80年代，他出版了一本名为《性的终结》的书，在书中他非常谦卑地说，我终于看到每个游戏都有规则，性也有规则，除非你按规则行事，否则你会发现性可以创造出一种无与伦比的孤独感。讽刺的是，性创造孤独。

所以你看到，事情可能进展得非常顺利，但性会来。约瑟，一切都很好。性来了。他甚至没有寻找它，但它来了。它向他袭来。你如何处理它将对你的生活有很大影响。

现在，我们从这段经文中学到了什么？在七宗罪中，这个被称为，我们将称之为情欲，我稍后会谈到这个词。但我们在这里学到的是，我们从波提乏的妻子所做的事情中学到了一些东西，我们从约瑟所做的事情中学到了一些东西，我们从神所做的事情中学到了一些东西，从波提乏的妻子那里我们学会了如何理解情欲，从约瑟那里我们学会了如何处理情欲，从神那里我们学会了如何治愈情欲，如何理解它，如何处理它，如何治愈它。

首先，让我们看看，当我们看到约瑟和波提乏的妻子时，我们实际上有两个不同的案例。我称之为约瑟的案例。好吧，但在某种意义上，这里有两个案例。两个关于性、性欲、情欲如何被对待的案例，因此我们有一个好的和一个坏的例子。通过波提乏的妻子，我们看到事情是如何运作的，我们学到了一些关于我们如何理解情欲的东西。

现在，有些人可能会对我使用情欲这个词感到不满。当吉米·卡特谈论情欲时，可怜的吉米·卡特。他说了一些话。我没有承认有时他会以情欲的心态看待一个女人，我仍然记得丹·阿克罗伊德在《周六夜现场》上花了三个月的时间拿吉米·卡特开玩笑。有些人会说，甚至情欲这个词让人想起倒退、压抑的维多利亚时代对性的态度，它可以。而且通常在圣经中，情欲这个词不是用来指性。但我们不能试图比耶稣更聪明。耶稣自己说，如果你以情欲看待某人，你已经在心里犯了奸淫。所以我们不要比耶稣更聪明。

在圣经中，情欲这个词通常与性无关，情欲的意思是失序的欲望。失序的欲望。那么我们从中学到了什么关于性情欲、性欲的东西呢？首先，我们看到波提乏的妻子注意到了约瑟。现在，你知道，不幸的是，英语中的注意这个词在这里有点太弱了。事实上，注意到某人身体美丽，这不是情欲。但这也不是波提乏的妻子所做的。希伯来语中字面意思是她抬起眼睛看他。这意味着沉思。她沉思他的美丽。字面意思是，他的身材美丽，面容美丽。他有一个伟大的身体和美丽的面孔。她沉思了这一点。然后我们看到，她花了很多时间沉思，她在心里与他上床的次数如此之多，最终，尽管有危险，尽管他拒绝，她必须在现实中与他上床。因此她尝试了。但最终我们看到，当他一次又一次地拒绝时，当她意识到她无法拥有他时，她变得凶狠，试图杀死他。你说，这在哪里？好吧，她指控他的事情是死罪。我们稍后会谈到这一点。

我们从情欲中学到了什么？好吧，首先是一个消极的，然后是积极的。消极地说，情欲本身不是性欲。约瑟没有说这是邪恶的事情，因为它是性的。他没有这么说。我们稍后会看到他怎么说的。他没有说这是罪，因为它是性的。圣经从未说过性欲本身是情欲。性欲本身是错误的。性欲本身是污染的、玷污的，根本不是。正如我们将看到的，圣经对性有着最光辉的看法。事实上，我很乐意说，圣经对性的看法是任何其他圣书或任何其他宗教中最崇高的。我不介意这样说。

在创世记 2 中，神创造了男性和女性。当他创造性时，我们被告知他看着它，立刻说它是好的。他告诉他们要繁衍。好吗？我们在旧约中看到，事实上，我们去年在箴言 5 中讲过这个，丈夫和妻子被命令在性上彼此陶醉。在新约中，在哥林多前书 7 中，同样的事情被告知他们。丈夫和妻子被命令有意识地培养彼此的性欲。所罗门之歌是对性爱的欢乐和生动的庆祝。

在历史上，当七宗罪被审视时，情欲从未在榜首。它在列表的下方。让我告诉你我的意思。骄傲、嫉妒、贪婪、愤怒，所有这些一直在列表的上方。这些东西一直是更严重的罪。为什么？因为基督教会的道德神学家一直知道，骄傲、贪婪、想伤害某人、想从某人那里偷窃、想把自己放在中心并践踏他人。这不是心灵所建造的。那些是不自然的欲望，不自然的。你不是为了偷窃而建造的，你不是为了伤害而建造的，你不是为了仇恨而建造的，你不是为了杀戮而建造的，但你是为了性欲而建造的。这就是为什么我们看到性情欲，正如我们将看到的，它是一个自然的欲望走错了路。

这就是为什么耶稣，你意识到当耶稣对当时的道德和宗教领袖说话时，他对性有多么肯定，他对宗教领袖说，自豪、嫉妒、贪婪的宗教领袖，他对他们说，妓女和皮条客比你们更接近天国。这是一种肯定。性本身，强烈的性欲本身不仅不是错误的，而且在某些情况下是被命令的。所以认为情欲是任何形式的性激情，这根本不是真的。

那么性欲是什么呢？它如何变成情欲？我将说，从这段经文中我们看到情欲是三件事，三种理解它的方法。首先，情欲是失控的欲望。我会很简短地说。看看这个可怜的女士，一旦她被她的性激情所控制，即使他给了她一个非常坚定的拒绝。而且不仅如此，即使她试图做的事情对她个人来说非常危险，她也无法停止。日复一日。

现在人们会告诉我们，性只是一个欲望。所以像任何其他欲望一样，当你饿了，你应该吃，当你感到性感，你应该有性。这只是一个欲望，这很好，没有人应该认为他们的欲望有什么问题。真的吗？真的吗？我所知道的没有其他欲望能如此迅速地变得如此痴迷。当然，有那位作家指出，如果你发现一个国家，当年轻人去上大学时，他们在墙上贴满了汉堡和热狗的海报，每个人都跑来跑去看。如果你发现一个国家，人们花钱看某人慢慢揭开蛋糕和派，你会认为那个国家充满了饥饿的人，然后你会惊讶地说，他们不仅不饿，而且他们吃得越多，他们就越这样做。这是一个失序的欲望。有些不对劲。这不仅仅是一个欲望。你不能信任这样的欲望。

所以首先，情欲是失控的欲望。它失控了。然而，更重要的是，情欲是没有承诺的欲望。情欲是没有承诺的欲望。这不仅仅是欲望。我们说过，这很好。首先，它是失序的欲望，然后其次，它是失控的欲望。其次，没有承诺的欲望。

现在，约瑟对她说这有什么问题？你是他的妻子。如果我们只看到这段经文，而对圣经一无所知，如果我们不知道圣经的其他部分对性或奸淫或其他任何事情说了什么，我们可能会认为他所说的真正问题只是她嫁给了他。如果她没有结婚，他没有结婚，那就没问题了。但我们从旧约和新约中知道，这不是他唯一的想法。他实际上是在说，当他说你不是他的妻子，你是他的妻子时，他也在说，你不是我的。这就是问题所在。看，这就是它。一个暗示另一个。

旧约和新约对此非常明确。性只在一个男人和一个女人之间，在一个完整的、排他性的和永久的承诺中被设计为婚姻。它只在一个男人和一个女人之间，在一个完整的、排他性的和永久的承诺中被设计为婚姻。无论一个人是否碰巧与其他人结婚。如果他们没有结婚，彼此之间，看到这就是约瑟所说的。约瑟不仅仅是在说她结婚了，因为你嫁给了他，这使得这件事邪恶。使它邪恶的不是因为它是性的，而是因为我们没有结婚。你不是我的妻子。

那么为什么圣经会这样说呢？这是原因所在。你可能相信性没有目的。性只是发生的事情。性是一个意外。它是进化的意外。你是一个意外。我们都是意外。没有韵律或理由。不。你的理智、你的感知、你的记忆、你的创造力、你的性欲，所有关于你的东西都相信这些东西是意外的。因此，它们不是由任何人设计的，没有目的。如果你相信这一点，当然，你不会喜欢我接下来要说的话，但你也有更多的问题，更多的问题。我的意思是，你可能有性自由的许可证，但你的生活没有意义。你没有权利称任何事情为对或错。你知道，我们有其他问题，更多的问题。我的意思是，如果你决定，我想要一个没有意义的存在，以便我可以有性，你已经咬下了比你能咀嚼的更多。

圣经说，性只为婚姻的原因是因为性被设计为两个目的。性是一个目标。性是目标。性有一个设计，一个目的，一个目标，两个，两个目的。当约瑟说我们没有结婚时，他想到的是目标的第一个。说性的两个目标。一个是次要目标，一个是最终目标。约瑟在这里说我们没有结婚时，他带出了性的次要目标。神意图性，他发明了性，作为一个标志和实现两个人之间完全生命统一的手段。神创造性不仅仅是一个标志。换句话说，表达和实现以及更新两个人之间完全生命统一的手段。

这应该是常识，但罪使我们看不见。我的意思是，身体的结合应该是其他领域结合的标志。我的意思是，这是绝对的逻辑。这是常识。这是精神上的。这是有意义的。这是美丽的。圣经说，你不应该在身体上表现出一些在精神上、个人上、社会上、法律上和其他方面不真实的东西。当保罗，你想了解圣经的性伦理，你必须看到保罗在哥林多前书 6 中说，他说，不要与妓女同寝。他说，难道你不知道你与谁同寝，你就与谁成为一体。

现在，你理解这个逻辑吗？这是他说的。它完全有意义。为了在身体上与某人合一，为了与某人发生性关系，你必须赤裸。赤裸意味着你变得如此脆弱。不仅人们看到你，另一个人看到你如你所是，但更重要的是，没有比性姿势更具防御性的身体姿势。当你发生性关系时，你是完全脆弱的。你没有武器。这就是为什么性暴力被每个人直觉地认为是一种道德邪恶、一种道德愤怒，因为当你发生性关系时，你是绝对脆弱的。你可能会被完全攻击，尤其是与你发生性关系的人，但你被完全攻击。你完全脆弱，因为你是一体的。成为一体，你失去了身体的独立性。你不能突然做出动作。你不能独立行动。你明白吗？不是一个好的战斗时间。不是一个好的防御时间。

好吧，圣经说，保罗说，圣经说，想想身体上发生的事情也应该在其他领域发生。圣经说，性是神设计的方式，告诉别人。我完全、排他性和永久性地属于你。

我们无论在哪里看到，都会看到破碎、战争、残酷和心痛。我们在周围的世界和我们自己的生活中感受到它。它是如何变成这样的？可以做些什么呢？在他本月发布的新书中，世界出了什么问题？Tim Keller 提供了一个清晰而富有同情心的答案。借鉴了在 Redeemer 教会的一系列教导，Keller 博士展示了罪的现实如何解释我们周围看到的痛苦，以及只有福音才能提供持久的自由和治愈。无论你是被我们世界的状态压倒，还是在自己的错误或选择中挣扎，还是在寻找希望和快乐，世界出了什么问题将帮助你看到福音如何对我们世界的心痛和我们每个人内心的痛苦说话。这本新发布的书《世界出了什么问题》，是我们本月感谢你对福音与生活的支持的礼物。今天在 gospelandlife.com/give 请求你的副本。这是 gospelandlife.com/give。

现在，如果你这样说，然后说我不想和你结婚，你就是在自相矛盾。除非你结婚，否则你不能完全、排他性和永久性地承诺给某人。当你在身体上合一时，你变得脆弱。但当一个人说我想和你发生性关系，但我不想和你结婚时，他们在说我不想在情感上如此紧密。我不想在法律上如此紧密。我不想在社会上如此紧密。我不想和你如此紧密，以至于我不能做出自己的决定。我想在身体上对你脆弱，但不是在精神上。你在说什么。我想要你的身体，但不是你。我想给你我的身体，但我不想给你我。你谈论不自然。基督教的性伦理是完全自然的。它将身体和灵魂结合在一起，任何其他伦理都会摧毁它们。它将它们分开。

C.S. Lewis 说得很棒，当他说在没有结婚的情况下发生性关系，想要没有承诺的快乐，想要没有承诺的快乐，就像试图品尝和吃食物然后呕吐出来。让我告诉你这个比喻有多深刻，尽管它是一个大胆的。他说，一个人想要品尝食物，但你不想让它成为你的一部分，你不想要吃的承诺。你不想要吃的后果。你不想要影响。你想要所有的快乐，但你不想要任何责任。你不想让它成为你的一部分。我们知道如果你试图这样做会发生什么。这被称为贪食症，它会在身体上摧毁你。将品尝与消化分开是完全不自然的。Lewis 有权到处说，你不明白吗，将身体结合从其他任何种类中抽象出来是同样不自然的。只说我想要没有目的的快乐。它会在精神上摧毁你。性是你对某人说我属于你的方式。它不仅是你已经完全承诺的标志。我属于你。你属于我。你不是你自己的。我不是我自己的。我们是一体的。这就是婚姻。如果你说我想要身体上的，但我不想要其他任何方式，神所结合的，不要让任何人分开。这是完全自然的。

你看，因此，让我们看看约瑟是如何处理的。因此，情欲不仅仅是失控的欲望。情欲不仅仅是没有承诺的欲望。它实际上是没有人的欲望。是的。情欲是爱的对立面。爱，你想要一个人。在情欲中，你只想要快乐。而人是达到快乐的必要商品。在爱中，你想要一个人。如果你必须放弃快乐，没关系。是人是不可谈判的。快乐是可谈判的。在情欲中，是快乐是不可谈判的。人是可谈判的，你怎么看？看看她发生了什么。看看波提乏的妻子，当她意识到他拒绝了她时。她想要肯定。她想要体验。当她看到她不能拥有他时，她变得凶狠。这不仅仅是当你不能得到那个人时，你真的看到你以为是爱的东西实际上是情欲，因为它变得凶狠。有时，即使你得到那个人，在撒母耳记下 13 章，有一个关于大卫的儿子亚们的惊人故事。亚们与他的同父异母妹妹他玛同寝。他把她弄上床。他诱惑了她。乱伦。我们被告知，在他诱惑她之前，他病得爱得要命。但如果你曾经读过那本书，它在撒母耳记下 13 章。这是一个惊人的段落。就在他完成性行为后，突然，他恨她的恨比他爱她的爱更大。他站起来说，起来走吧。发生了什么？情欲是没有人的欲望。情欲是疯狂地爱上一个你甚至不认识的人。你看到的只是你认为他们能给你的东西。你甚至不知道他们是谁。换句话说，罪把情欲变成了。一个好东西，性欲，罪把性欲变成了情欲，因为它使性欲成为目的本身，而不是服务他人的方式。通过它你可以学习给予快乐的难以置信的快乐。相反，学习给予快乐的快乐，使用性作为服务他人的方式，服务你承诺的人，你试图给予快乐的人，反而成为目的本身，而人只是一个必要的商品。所以我们可以丢弃人。我们这样做了。随着时间的推移，只要我们拥有这个东西。

### 处理情欲

现在约瑟是如何处理的？他教会了我们一些相当了不起的东西。正如你所看到的，罪使性欲成为一种非常强大的东西。好吧，他是如何处理的？他这样处理。首先，好吧，他做了两件事。一件是显而易见的。一件是不那么明显的。一件是他控制了他的行为。你注意到他说他拒绝与她在一起。你看到了吗？他说不仅拒绝上床，他拒绝与她在一起，他远离她。他远离诱惑。我们上周和他谈过。但他做的另一件事，他不仅控制了他的行为，他还控制了他的思想。

詹姆斯·菲克斯，写了《跑步的完整书》的家伙，在那本书中有一个迷人的地方，他说，跑马拉松最难的事情是你的思想。他发现，在成为马拉松跑者的早期阶段，在马拉松的过程中，疲劳会如此之大，以至于你的思想会说，你为什么要开始这场比赛？是什么吸引你去长跑？詹姆斯·菲克斯说，我发现我没有答案。我不记得我为什么想要。他说，有一次他直接退出了一场马拉松，因为你的大脑在热的时候会捉弄你。他说，大脑会突然决定忘记你喜欢跑步的原因，跑步对你的总体好处，这场比赛的巨大好处，你甚至无法记住。所以他说，他学会了，如果你要坚持那场马拉松度过艰难时期，最重要的事情之一是，他说，事先，你必须几乎背诵你喜欢跑步的原因。背诵原因是一个重要的比赛。背诵原因，以便你可以告诉你的大脑。但他说，你知道，如果事情真的变得糟糕，你不能记住一切，你知道他说什么吗？他说，我用来捉弄我的大脑的最后一件事是，我会说，好吧，我知道当我到达那里时，我会记得。我知道我有一个好的理由开始。当我到达那里时，我会记得。

现在这有很多智慧，这就是约瑟所做的。约瑟说，我怎么能做这邪恶的事，得罪神呢？现在就是这样。现在，他对自己说了两件事。首先，他说，我怎么能做这邪恶的事呢？现在然后指的是我们没有结婚的事实。因此，他所做的是提醒自己婚姻的次要目的。婚姻的次要目的是身体和灵魂的绝对结合，而不是将它们分开，而是将它们结合在一起。那么他做了什么？他对自己说，我不会成为一个怪物。我不会摧毁自己。我不会将神所结合的分开。但我想如果约瑟完全空白，这就是你可以说的，顺便说一下，如果你完全空白，你说，看，没有婚外性。这是两千年来，基督教会的每一个分支都同意的事情，正统的天主教和新教。犹太教、儒教、印度教、伊斯兰教，这些伟大宗教的几个世纪，他们在许多其他事情上意见不一，他们都同意这一点。他们都相信这一点。唯一不相信的人是一些，这只是最近非常小的泡沫口袋中的信仰，你知道，像曼哈顿。所以你必须说，我知道有一个好的理由，我只是不记得当我到达那里时，当我到达终点线时，一切都会回来。

这不是他唯一说的。他记住了，他用次要目标填满了他的思想，但他也用最终目标填满了他的思想。他说，我怎么能做这件事，得罪神呢？现在，这怎么能是得罪神呢？现在，这可能是得罪波提乏，丈夫，是的，这可能是得罪波提乏的妻子。如果他在她的激情中屈服于她，他肯定可以说他是在得罪她。他当然可以说他是在得罪自己和自己的身体，但怎么能是神呢？这是原因，因为我告诉过你性有两个目标，这是最终目标。性的最终目标是成为绝对狂喜和与神完全结合的喜悦的开胃菜和标志。性是一个标志和一个圣经的，按照圣经神学，性是一个预尝和标志和一个指向与神完全结合的难以置信的喜悦和狂喜的路标。

在以弗所书 5 中，新约说，当丈夫和妻子结合时，这是一个伟大的奥秘，但它告诉我们，它向我们展示了基督与他的子民结合。在罗马书 7 中，保罗是如此明确。他说，就像丈夫和妻子进入彼此的怀抱，通过性结合，果实通过女人的身体诞生到世界上。所以当基督和信徒在彼此的怀抱中时，基督的果实通过你诞生到世界上，难以置信，这就是圣经所说的。性是对那的预尝。当性在这里是最好的可能时，你想要什么？你得到什么？你想要有人完全看到你，而不仅仅是容忍它。看到你赤裸，而不仅仅是容忍它，但你想看到他们对你的喜悦。当他们看到你时，你想在他们的眼中看到他们看着你，好像你是圣洁的，没有瑕疵。这就是我们照镜子的原因。这就是为什么很多人不想发生性关系或结婚。你害怕人们会看到什么。你可以掩盖它。总有化妆品。有各种各样的掩盖方式，但在这里，某人会看到你的想法，你真正想要的性，如果某人看到你并完全了解你，然后在你身上找到喜悦，好像你是圣洁的，没有瑕疵。然后你想要某人的手臂围绕你，给你一个绝对安全的摇篮，为你的绝对脆弱时刻，你想做同样的事情。你知道吗？没有人能做到这一点。

有趣的是，当性进行得很好，爱进行得很好时，我们唯一能谈论它的方式是宗教语言。这是上帝存在的性证明，性，爱，使你谈论不真实的事情。你开始说，我会永远爱你。你知道，即使是伟大的，即使是滴水的歌曲。它们继续下去。它们说，比海洋中的鱼更长，比任何鸟飞得更高，比天上的星星更长。我一直爱着你。我们继续，哦，为什么？因为你的性欲指向永恒。即使你认为你得到了它，你也没有。这是一种幻觉。你的性欲一旦成为一种宇宙的闭合，没有人能在地球上给你。没有人能像那样爱你。没有人能真正说，我永远不会，永远不会，永远不会，永远不会，永远不会抛弃你。因为人会死。人是罪人。没有人能看着你，看着你没有瑕疵，除了一个说，我永远不会离开你，永远不会抛弃你。谁说，在我看来，你是圣洁的，没有瑕疵，因为我为你而死，我用我自己的义为你穿上衣服。我用珠宝装饰你。你知道，试图从别人那里得到只有上帝能给的闭合是对上帝的重大罪过。因此，基督徒能够解密性。这就是他所做的。基督徒是一个说，这是罪，如果我的性欲失控，因为我试图从一个永远不能给我的人那里得到闭合，我会降级它。性是一个伟大的东西。我希望有一天我会有一个美好的性生活。但如果我让这驱动我，我试图得到一些它永远不能给的东西。试图从中得到一些它永远不能给的东西。自我控制不是通过消极地思考性来实现的。基督教的自我控制是通过光辉地思考性来实现的，它在某种意义上将其放在这里和现在的位置。

如果你像约瑟一样顺服，神会做什么？它说什么？第 21 节，神与他同在。如果你像约瑟一样顺服，你会经历拒绝。你会经历暂时的孤立。你会有像约瑟一样的人嘲笑你。但你知道吗？波提乏一定实际上信任，他至少必须怀疑，约瑟的正直一定是如此难以置信的好，以至于当他的妻子来指控他时，波提乏的心中一定有疑虑，因为他被指控的事情是死罪。我们知道这一点。因此波提乏一定有疑虑。他的正直如此之大，以至于即使在那样的时刻也拯救了他。神与他同在，他也会与你同在。

但是什么，我知道有人在问，如果约瑟不是我的榜样呢？如果我更像波提乏的妻子呢？耶稣对我说什么？他对你说的和他对被捉奸的女人说的一样。他站在她面前，他对她说了什么？他不会投石。为什么？他说，去吧，不要再犯罪了。我也不定你的罪。你知道有什么令人惊讶的吗？当他说那句话时，首先，他称罪为罪。他说，不要再犯罪了。他没有说这不是罪。性罪是罪。但然后他说，我也不定你的罪。等等。如果你说某人有罪，那么你必须定他们的罪。如果你说他们没有被定罪，那么他们一定，他们一定没有罪。耶稣说，你有罪，我不定你的罪。他怎么能这么说？我知道为什么。你知道当他说那句话时，他的脑海里在想什么吗？他说，我亲爱的姐妹，你有罪。但对你没有定罪，因为我不向你投石，因为我将接受应该到你身上的石头。我将接受长矛。我将接受荆棘。我将接受发烧和血汗，以便在你面前，在我面前和我父亲面前，你可以是圣洁的，没有瑕疵。

如果你接受基督，在马太福音的家谱中发生的最伟大的事情之一，马太福音第 1 章，第 1 节，接下来，它给出了弥赛亚的家谱，在弥赛亚的家谱中有他玛。他玛，乱伦的受害者，拔示巴，奸淫者，喇合，妓女，玛利亚，未婚单亲母亲。他们在家谱中做什么？耶稣基督说，我为你感到骄傲。我不在乎你做了什么。我不在乎你做了什么。如果你接受我，我为你感到骄傲。去吧，不要再犯罪了。我也不定你的罪。如果你承认你的罪，他会对你说平安。但如果你对自己说平安，他会指出你的罪。这就是它的工作原理。来找他，让我们祷告。

我们的父，我们请求你让我们如此意识到你赋予我们的性本质的光辉性质，以至于我们可能在美好的自我控制中找到自己。教导我们如何理解，如何处理，以及如何治愈。在我们因你的儿子而受伤和破碎的性方面，他说，我也不定你的罪。去吧，不要再犯罪了。奉耶稣的名祷告。阿门。
