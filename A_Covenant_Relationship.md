### Introduction: A Covenant Relationship

How do we share what it means to truly know Jesus? Not just as a historical figure or moral teacher, but as Savior and King. This month Tim Keller explores what the Bible shows us about being public with our faith and sharing the hope we have in Christ. Our scripture comes from Deuteronomy 29-23.

Moses summoned all the Israelites and said to them, your eyes have seen all that the Lord did in Egypt to Pharaoh to all his officials and all to all in his land. With your own eyes, you saw those great trials, those miraculous signs and great wonders. But to this day, the Lord has not given you a mind that understands or eyes that see or ears that hear. Carefully follow the terms of this covenant so that you may prosper in everything you do.

> "All of you are standing today in the presence of the Lord your God, your leaders and chief men, your elders and officials, and all the other men of Israel, together with your children and your wives and the aliens living in your camps who chop your wood and carry your water. You are standing here in order to enter into a covenant with the Lord your God. A covenant the Lord is making with you this day and sealing with an oath. To confirm you this day as his people that he may be your God as he promised you and as he swore to your father's Abraham, Isaac and Jacob."

I am making this covenant with its oath not only with you who are standing here with us today in the presence of the Lord our God, but also with those who are not here today. You yourselves know how we lived in Egypt and how we passed through the countries on the way here. You saw among them their detestable images and idols of wood and stone, of silver and gold. Make sure there is no man or woman clan or tribe among you today whose hearts turn away from the Lord our God to go and worship the gods of those nations. Make sure there is no root among you that produces such bitter poison.

This is the word of the Lord.

### The Uniqueness of the Covenant

We've been saying that Deuteronomy is a series of sermons that Moses preached just before he died. And if the last thing practically that Moses said because here we are at almost at the end of the end before he died was you need to be in a covenant relationship with God. If Moses thought it was that important that it would be almost the last thing he says, then it would be who of us to figure out what that is. What's a covenant relationship with God?

If we read the passage with that question in mind, we'll learn three things. The uniqueness of the covenant, the mystery surrounding the covenant, and the hero of the covenant. The uniqueness, the mystery, and the hero of the covenant.

First of all, the uniqueness. People often will say maybe somebody's already thinking, can't you come up with a less archaic word than covenant? Don't you have a more modern word than covenant? And the answer is no. There's no more modern word because modern society and culture doesn't really even have a category anymore for it.

If you want to understand what a covenant is, look at verse 12 in the beginning of 13. You are standing here in order to enter into a covenant with the Lord your God. A covenant the Lord is making with you this day and sealing with an oath to confirm you this day as His people.

Now please notice two things. On the one hand, notice the language of love and intimacy, personal possessive pronouns. You see, for example, it says, we are His people, not just A people. He is our God, not just God. Whenever you hear personal possessive pronouns being used, you know it's talking about an intimate relationship.

So if you were just overhearing somebody who you didn't even know, talk about my Johnny or my Susie, you would assume that person was talking about child, spouse or someone very close, someone very intimate. So first, when you look at a covenant, you see the language of love and intimacy.

Secondly, however, you see the language of law. See, sealing with an oath to confirm and there you have it. What's a covenant? A covenant is a relationship, but it's a relationship more loving and intimate than a merely legal relationship yet more binding and enduring and accountable than a merely personal relationship. It's a stunning blend.

The covenant is a stunning blend of law and love. It's stunning because it's a personal relationship made more loving and intimate because it's legal through voluntary, mutual, binding promises and vows to be loving and to be faithful, no matter what the circumstances. That's a covenant.

Now, modern society doesn't really have a category for this, because modern society makes everything be ordered around the experiencing individual self and the happiness and fulfillment of the individual self. In modern society, your individual happiness and fulfillment and rights is the absolute and everything else is a means to an end. All other institutions, all other relationships.

So in modern society, relationships more and more start like this. Two people look at each other and they say, I will be what I should be as long as and to the degree that you are what you should be. And if you're not, I'm out.

But in a covenant, two people look at each other and say, I will be what I should be whether you are what you should be or not. I will be what I should be whether you are being what you should be or not. And therefore, it's scary to get into a covenant. And it only works if both people in a covenant say that.

In a covenant relationship, both have to say, I'll be what I should be even if you're not what you should be. Now, if only once says that and the other does not, then what you've got is exploitation or even abuse. But if you really do get into a covenant relationship, where two parties are each saying, you are more important than me. The relationship is more important than my needs. I will be committed to your needs before my needs. I will be committed to the relationship even if it's not meeting my needs at the moment. I give you my independence. I give you part of my freedom as a gift of love.

And if one side and the other side are both saying that. If both people are saying, I'm not after my needs, I'm after your needs. I will sacrifice for you. If both people are saying that, that is a far more fulfilling, far more deep and profound, far more life-changing and joyful relationship than a consumer relationship in which each side says, I'll be in this as long as you're meeting my needs.

Now, I don't want you to give you the impression that all relationships ought to be covenant relationships. You should have consumer relationships. For example, I know my grocer. My grocer knows me. The grocer, as I guess, am I going to the grocery store? They know me. I know them and say, hi, hi. But if I find a grocery store closer with better food at lower prices, I'm out of there. I'm just out of there because that's a consumer relationship, not a covenant relationship.

So then plenty of our relationships should be liked. And at one end of the spectrum, they are. At the other end, you have marriage. Relationship between parents and children. You have covenant relationships. And in the middle, you have various kinds of relationships. Some friends, the closest friends are more covenantal. Some are not so much.

But here's my point. Here's the point. If the most profound, most joyful, most life-changing, most deep and glorious relationships are covenantal relationships, then your relationship with God has got to be through and through a covenantal relationship. That has to be.

Now, here's the problem. Modern people, as I said, they can't have trouble mixing law and love together. And what they say is, oh, I'm spiritual, but I'm not religious. Sociologists for years, and I've been finding modern people like to say, I'm spiritual, but not religious, and what does that mean? Here's what it means. I believe in God. I want a relationship with God, but I don't want to go to an institution. I don't want to go to a church or a synagogue. I don't want people to tell me what I have to believe. I don't want to give up my freedom. I don't want to give up my right to determine what is right or wrong for me.

In other words, what everybody's saying is, I want a personal relationship with God, but not a covenantal relationship. But the Bible says, as impossible, God only relates in terms of covenant. Every time he relates to somebody, Adam, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, Moses, it's always covenantal.

And so that's point one. The uniqueness, a category-busting thing is a covenantal relationship, a mixture of law and love that creates the most profound, fulfilling, life-changing relationships, and above all, the only way to relate to God.

### The Mystery Surrounding the Covenant

The second point, however, the second thing we learned here is there's a mystery surrounding this covenantal relationship. Now, what do I mean? All covenants have terms or conditions, because all contracts have terms and conditions. A covenant is more than a contract, but not less. All contracts have terms or conditions, and if you meet the terms or conditions, there are rewards or blessings. And if you fail to meet them, or if you violate the terms or conditions, there are penalties or in the biblical term, curses.

So in verse 9, you see, it says, carefully follow the terms of this covenant so that you may prosper in everything you do. See, that's the blessings of the covenant. Carefully follow the conditions. But then, down to verse 18, it says, but make sure there's no man or woman, clan or tribe among you today, whose heart turns away from the Lord your God and worships other gods. And that's getting into the area of the passage that talks about the curse. If you violate the covenant, there are penalties. That's what makes a contract valuable. I mean, if you didn't have penalties, what good would the contract be? It's what keeps people honest. It's backbone in your commitment.

And yet, listen, as you keep, let me keep reading. We didn't print the down to verses 19, 2021, but let me keep reading the passage. It says, don't let there be any man or woman, clan or tribe who begins to worship other gods. And it says, the Lord, this is verse 20, the Lord will never forgive the one who does this. His wrath and zeal will burn against that man. All the curses written in this book will fall upon him. The Lord will bring him disaster according to all the curses of the covenant written in this book of the law.

Now, wait a minute. When you hear it say, I will never forgive you if you break the covenant. Never. All the curses will come down if you violate the covenant. You say, well, wait a minute. I thought God was a forgiving God. And yet, of course, if he's a covenant God, what good is a covenant? If you just ignore the penalty, say, well, who cares? I'll forgive you.

And at this point, understanding the covenant gets us into the very heart of the central mystery of the Bible. And gets us right into the very heart of what the central message of the Bible is. Because if you read through the Bible, hold a New Testament on every page in every book, not just some books, not just the Old Testament or the New Testament, on every page in every book you have statements like this where God says, I cannot bless a disobedient people. I cannot. You must obey. I am a just judge. I cannot wink at guilt. An earthly judge who winked at the guilty would be run out of town. How much less can I? You must obey. I can't overlook it. I can't bless a disobedient people.

There's a whole, there's hundreds of statements like that. But there are also on every page in every book in Old New Testament, hundreds of statements that say, I will never leave you or I will never give up on you. I will always accept you. I will never forsake you. Over and over and over. If you read to the Psalms regularly, you guess one after the other in the same Psalm sometimes. You have God saying, I can only bless you if you do this. And other times where God says, I'm going to bless you no matter what.

And I had a professor years ago who said, this is the...this perceivably irreconcilable tension. This apparently irresolvable tension is the very plot line under all the other plot lines of the Bible. It's the thing that propels the narrative of the Bible forward. Because you see the people and you see God's people failing and failing and failing. And then the question comes up, will God give into His people and just accept whatever they do than what about His holiness? Or will God just give up on His people? But then what about His faithfulness?

And let me put it to you, theologically, that's narratively. Are the blessings of God conditional or unconditional? That's the question. Class. Do the blessings of God come conditionally? You've got to be good, you've got to fulfill the cup. Or unconditionally, it doesn't matter what you do, you're going to get them anywhere.

There's a conditional rank addition. Now listen. The problem is that the Bible over and over and over again seems to give contradictory answers. And this is so pervasive and it's so apparently irreconcilable that almost every one of us tends to come down on one side of the other instead of following the biblical balance. What do I mean by that? Most people either fall into one or the other. Most people either read the Bible in a liberal way. And that is they say, yes, you need to obey. Yes, you should obey the Ten Commandments. Yes, you should be good. But in the end God loves everybody and will accept everybody.

Or you can come down on a conservative side. And you can say, well, yes, God is very loving. But in the end, you've got to be good or he won't love you. Everybody comes down on one or the other. Everybody says law is the reality and love is secondary. In other words, basically the promises and blessings of God are conditional. Or they say, no, love is more real than law. Love is the important thing. The law is secondary and therefore they believe that the blessings of God are basically unconditional.

And so everybody, because they don't understand how to resolve this tension at the heart of the covenant, tends to slide toward relativism or moralism, toward being a sadducee or being a Pharisee, toward basically feeling like, I pretty much can live the way I want to, ultimately, because God's going to love me anyway, or feeling guilt-ridden and condemned because you're never living up.

But the Bible doesn't resolve it all through the Hebrew scriptures, all through the Old Testament. And there's one place where God actually says, in Judges 2, verse 1, I said, I would never break my covenant with you. And then two verses later he says, I also said, I will not bless you if you disobey me.

Michael Wilcock, who is a commentator, writing a comment here on the book of Judges, puts it like this. It's almost as if God is saying, I have sworn to bless you, and I also have sworn not to bless a disobedient people. What is this you have done to me? And by what fearful means do you think I am to solve this situation?

Well, how do you resolve it? How do you resolve it? The answer is in the second half of verse 13, because in the second half of verse 13 it says that he may be your God as he promised you and as he swore to your father's Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Now, where did God take the covenant oath? Where did God take the oath? And where did he take the oath to Abraham? It's in Genesis 15. And if you understand what happens in Genesis 15, you are at the very heart of what the Bible is all about.

In Genesis 15, God has said to Abraham, I will bless you. But Abraham says, how do I know? How can I be sure? So God says, well here's what I want you to do. I want you to kill some animals and to cut the animals into pieces and arrange the pieces in two rows with an aisle so you can walk through them. Now you and I are utterly confused by that, but Abraham wasn't. Because in those days when a great Lord wanted to make a covenant with a peon or a peasant or a lesser vassal or servant, that's how it was done. Animals were slain, the pieces were arranged, and when the servant took the oath of loyalty to the Lord, the servant did so as he was walking between the pieces. Why? He was acting out the curse of the covenant. He was saying, I swear loyalty to you, O Lord, and if I do not keep my promise, may I be cut into pieces like this.

So Abraham figured if he was arranging a situation for a covenant ceremony, and so he cut the pieces up and he expected that he would be called to walk through because the Lord's never walked through the pieces. So he waited, and he waited. And then all of a sudden Genesis 15 tells us, incredible darkness came down. It was the darkness of judgment, and in the midst of the darkness was God. He appeared as a smoking fiery pillar just like at Mount Sinai later on. And he passed through the pieces as he promised to bless Abraham.

Now Abraham was startled, and almost every commentator who's ever tried to come to grips with Genesis 15 is startled, because what that means is God is not just saying, I will bless you, but he's promising to die if he doesn't bless him. He's promising to be torn to pieces if he doesn't bless Abraham. Well, that's amazing. Sure, it's amazing, but that's not all. Abraham had two shocks. The first shock was that God went through the pieces, but the second shock was that Abraham was never called to go through the pieces himself. The ceremony ended, and we're told in chapter 15, verse 18, and therefore God made a covenant with Abraham, but this was unheard of. Unheard of. It was amazing for the Lord to come and walk through the pieces, but for the servant not even to make the oath?

Do you know what that meant? Abraham knew what it meant, though he didn't see how it could be. It meant God was making the promise for both of them, and he was taking the curse of the covenant on for both of them. And what he was doing was he was saying, not only will I be torn to pieces if I don't keep my promise. I'll be torn to pieces if you don't. Oh, Abraham, Abraham, God is saying, and to all of us, oh, world, I will bless you no matter what. Even if it means that my immortality must become mortal. Even if my glory must be drowned in darkness, even if I have to literally be torn to pieces, and he was.

Because centuries later, darkness came down on Mount Calvary, thick darkness, and the midst of the darkness, there was God in the person of Jesus Christ, and he was literally being torn to pieces, nails, spears, thorns. Why? He was taking the covenant curse. And it's Paul, who says, Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us. He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to us all through Jesus Christ.

You know what that means? This is the answer to all the riddles. Paul says in Romans 4, this is how God can be both just and justifier of those who believe. I mean, this is the ultimate blend of law and love. How so? Don't you see? Class? Are the blessings of God conditional or unconditional? Yes. Yes, why? Because on the cross, Jesus Christ absolutely fulfilled the conditions of the law so that God could love you absolutely unconditionally. With his perfect life, Jesus Christ completely fulfilled the terms of the covenant, verse 9, and he earned the blessing. But with his sacrificial death, he completely fulfilled the curse of the covenant. And that leaves the blessing for you and me, and anyone who lifts the empty hands of faith and asks for it.

Jesus Christ fulfilled the conditions of the covenant so that we could be received unconditionally. And that is the reason why when my wife and I, 33 years ago, Kathy and I walked out of a class in Old Testament covenant theology, 33 years ago this month. And for the first time that was explained to us, Jesus' perfect life earned the blessing, his sacrificial death, took the curse, that leaves the blessing for you. That's what God Paul is saying in Genesis in Galatians 3. When we walked out, we looked at each other and we said, I think I finally understand the gospel. We said it to each other. Do you?

And if you do, let me just quickly apply this. If you understand this finally, number one, it will lead you into paradoxical obedience. What do I mean by paradoxical obedience? Until you grasp the covenant, until you grasp covenant theology, until you grasp the gospel. I said, you have a tendency to either look at the law as something that is you've got obey or God's going to get you. So you either look at the blessings of God as conditional. So you're always feeling like I'm not living up. You always feel kind of a sense of condemnation. Or you basically believe God just loves everybody unconditionally. And you feel like the law is a good thing, but you don't take it all that seriously.

But when you understand that Jesus Christ fulfilled the conditions at radical, infinite cost to himself, so that we could be loved unconditionally. Now, when I look at the law of God, first of all, the law of God is the conditions of the covenant. And I say, I've got to take those things seriously, really seriously, because Jesus died to fulfill this. This is important. And so with all my might, I try to obey. With every fiber of my being, I try to obey the will and will of God in terms of the covenant. But when I fail, and I will fail, and I do fail, I know there's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. Because my obedience is a way of saying thank you to God. And it's a way of becoming like God, but it's not a way of earning my way into God.

And therefore, if you understand the gospel, there's this fascinating balance in your attitude toward the law. You resist sin like crazy, and you never have a sense of condemnation and despair when you fall into it. Huh? Isn't that amazing? And no one else has that kind of balance.

So first of all, it leads to paradoxical obedience. Secondly, it leads to absolute trust. It's scary to get married, you know why? Because two people say, I'm going to give everything for you. How do you know? How do they know? How do they know about you? How do you know about you? See, when two people come together, you say, I'm going to sacrifice for you. I'm going to give my life for you. I'm going to do everything for you. And you're not really sure whether the other person will do it. You're not even sure if you will do it. It's kind of scary to get married. That's another sermon.

But when Jesus Christ calls you into a covenant relationship, you know what He's saying? I want to marry you. I want you to come into a legally binding, intimate love relationship with me. I want to marry you, but you don't have to be uncertain because I've already taken the plunge of love. I've already gone to the mat. I've already died for you. Oh, trust him. What more could anyone do than that?

Thirdly, covenant theology not only gives you paradoxical obedience and absolute trust, it also leads to church membership. Oh yeah, you know why? Because once you understand the gospel, accountability is not this horrible thing. In fact, you also understand accountability is good for you. And therefore, throughout the history of the Bible, you'll see that people who get into a covenant relationship with each other are also in a covenant relationship with God, are also in a covenant relationship with others who have that covenant relationship with God. They are accountable to other believers. They don't just come to church like a consumer, but they covenant and they say, I'm accountable. I support. I'm responsible here. In other words, they join the churches. They don't just come.

Do you understand the gospel? That's one of the implications. Paradoxical obedience, absolute trust, church membership, and getting serious, finally, about God. You see, modern spirituality gives you a wispy God who's kind of anything you want Him to be, but covenant theology gives you a crunchy God. A God that's real, a God that bites back.

C.S. Lewis puts it like this.

> "An impersonal God, well and good. A subject of God of beauty, truth and goodness inside our own heads. Better still. A formless life force, surging through everyone, a vast power which we can all tap. Best of all. But a living God, pulling at the other end of the cord, approaching at infinite speed, the hunter, the covenant lord, the husband, that is quite another matter. There comes a moment when people who have been dabbling in religion suddenly draw back. Supposing you really find Him, we never meant it to come to that. We're still supposing He found you. If there is a God, you are in a sense alone with Him. You cannot put Him off with speculations about your neighbor's hypocrisy or memories of what you have read in books. What will all that chatter in hearsay count when the anesthetic fog, we call the real world, fades away, and the divine presence in which you have always stood, becomes palpable, immediate and unavoidable."

I invite you into a serious relationship with a covenant God.

Let's pray.

Our Father, give us a deep understanding of the gospel. So our lives can really be changed, buy it and through it. We thank You for giving us Your Son. And therefore, we now, in turn, give You ourselves. We pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.

### Introduction: A Covenant Relationship

How do we share what it means to truly know Jesus? Not just as a historical figure or moral teacher, but as Savior and King. This month Tim Keller explores what the Bible shows us about being public with our faith and sharing the hope we have in Christ. Our scripture comes from Deuteronomy 29-23.

Moses summoned all the Israelites and said to them, your eyes have seen all that the Lord did in Egypt to Pharaoh to all his officials and all to all in his land. With your own eyes, you saw those great trials, those miraculous signs and great wonders. But to this day, the Lord has not given you a mind that understands or eyes that see or ears that hear. Carefully follow the terms of this covenant so that you may prosper in everything you do.

> "All of you are standing today in the presence of the Lord your God, your leaders and chief men, your elders and officials, and all the other men of Israel, together with your children and your wives and the aliens living in your camps who chop your wood and carry your water. You are standing here in order to enter into a covenant with the Lord your God. A covenant the Lord is making with you this day and sealing with an oath. To confirm you this day as his people that he may be your God as he promised you and as he swore to your father's Abraham, Isaac and Jacob."

I am making this covenant with its oath not only with you who are standing here with us today in the presence of the Lord our God, but also with those who are not here today. You yourselves know how we lived in Egypt and how we passed through the countries on the way here. You saw among them their detestable images and idols of wood and stone, of silver and gold. Make sure there is no man or woman clan or tribe among you today whose hearts turn away from the Lord our God to go and worship the gods of those nations. Make sure there is no root among you that produces such bitter poison.

This is the word of the Lord.

### The Uniqueness of the Covenant

We've been saying that Deuteronomy is a series of sermons that Moses preached just before he died. And if the last thing practically that Moses said because here we are at almost at the end of the end before he died was you need to be in a covenant relationship with God. If Moses thought it was that important that it would be almost the last thing he says, then it would be who of us to figure out what that is. What's a covenant relationship with God?

If we read the passage with that question in mind, we'll learn three things. The uniqueness of the covenant, the mystery surrounding the covenant, and the hero of the covenant. The uniqueness, the mystery, and the hero of the covenant.

First of all, the uniqueness. People often will say maybe somebody's already thinking, can't you come up with a less archaic word than covenant? Don't you have a more modern word than covenant? And the answer is no. There's no more modern word because modern society and culture doesn't really even have a category anymore for it.

A covenant is a relationship, but it's a relationship more loving and intimate than a merely legal relationship yet more binding and enduring and accountable than a merely personal relationship. It's a stunning blend.

The covenant is a stunning blend of law and love. It's stunning because it's a personal relationship made more loving and intimate because it's legal through voluntary, mutual, binding promises and vows to be loving and to be faithful, no matter what the circumstances. That's a covenant.

Now, modern society doesn't really have a category for this, because modern society makes everything be ordered around the experiencing individual self and the happiness and fulfillment of the individual self. In modern society, your individual happiness and fulfillment and rights is the absolute and everything else is a means to an end. All other institutions, all other relationships.

So in modern society, relationships more and more start like this. Two people look at each other and they say, I will be what I should be as long as and to the degree that you are what you should be. And if you're not, I'm out.

But in a covenant, two people look at each other and say, I will be what I should be whether you are what you should be or not.

I don't want to give up my freedom. I don't want to give up my right to determine what is right or wrong for me.

In other words, what everybody's saying is, I want a personal relationship with God, but not a covenantal relationship. But the Bible says, as impossible, God only relates in terms of covenant. Every time he relates to somebody, Adam, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, Moses, it's always covenantal.

And so that's point one. The uniqueness, a category-busting thing is a covenantal relationship, a mixture of law and love that creates the most profound, fulfilling, life-changing relationships, and above all, the only way to relate to God.

### The Mystery Surrounding the Covenant

The second point, however, the second thing we learned here is there's a mystery surrounding this covenantal relationship. Now, what do I mean? All covenants have terms or conditions, because all contracts have terms and conditions. A covenant is more than a contract, but not less. All contracts have terms or conditions, and if you meet the terms or conditions, there are rewards or blessings. And if you fail to meet them, or if you violate the terms or conditions, there are penalties or in the biblical term, curses.

So in verse 9, you see, it says, carefully follow the terms of this covenant so that you may prosper in everything you do. See, that's the blessings of the covenant. Carefully follow the conditions. But then, down to verse 18, it says, but make sure there's no man or woman, clan or tribe among you today, whose heart turns away from the Lord your God and worships other gods. And that's getting into the area of the passage that talks about the curse. If you violate the covenant, there are penalties. That's what makes a contract valuable. I mean, if you didn't have penalties, what good would the contract be? It's what keeps people honest. It's backbone in your commitment.

And yet, listen, as you keep, let me keep reading. We didn't print the down to verses 19, 2021, but let me keep reading the passage. It says, don't let there be any man or woman, clan or tribe who begins to worship other gods. And it says, the Lord, this is verse 20, the Lord will never forgive the one who does this. His wrath and zeal will burn against that man. All the curses written in this book will fall upon him. The Lord will bring him disaster according to all the curses of the covenant written in this book of the law.

Now, wait a minute. When you hear it say, I will never forgive you if you break the covenant. Never. All the curses will come down if you violate the covenant. You say, well, wait a minute. I thought God was a forgiving God. And yet, of course, if he's a covenant God, what good is a covenant? If you just ignore the penalty, say, well, who cares? I'll forgive you.

And at this point, understanding the covenant gets us into the very heart of the central mystery of the Bible. And gets us right into the very heart of what the central message of the Bible is. Because if you read through the Bible, hold a New Testament on every page in every book, not just some books, not just the Old Testament or the New Testament, on every page in every book you have statements like this where God says, I cannot bless a disobedient people. I cannot. You must obey. I am a just judge. I cannot wink at guilt. An earthly judge who winked at the guilty would be run out of town. How much less can I? You must obey. I can't overlook it. I can't bless a disobedient people.

There's a whole, there's hundreds of statements like that. But there are also on every page in every book in Old New Testament, hundreds of statements that say, I will never leave you or I will never give up on you. I will always accept you. I will never forsake you. Over and over and over. If you read to the Psalms regularly, you guess one after the other in the same Psalm sometimes. You have God saying, I can only bless you if you do this. And other times where God says, I'm going to bless you no matter what.

And I had a professor years ago who said, this is the...this perceivably irreconcilable tension. This apparently irresolvable tension is the very plot line under all the other plot lines of the Bible. It's the thing that propels the narrative of the Bible forward. Because you see the people and you see God's people failing and failing and failing. And then the question comes up, will God give into His people and just accept whatever they do than what about His holiness? Or will God just give up on His people? But then what about His faithfulness?

And let me put it to you, theologically, that's narratively. Are the blessings of God conditional or unconditional? That's the question. Class. Do the blessings of God come conditionally? You've got to be good, you've got to fulfill the cup. Or unconditionally, it doesn't matter what you do, you're going to get them anywhere.

There's a conditional rank addition. Now listen. The problem is that the Bible over and over and over again seems to give contradictory answers. And this is so pervasive and it's so apparently irreconcilable that almost every one of us tends to come down on one side of the other instead of following the biblical balance. What do I mean by that? Most people either fall into one or the other. Most people either read the Bible in a liberal way. And that is they say, yes, you need to obey. Yes, you should obey the Ten Commandments. Yes, you should be good. But in the end God loves everybody and will accept everybody.

Or you can come down on a conservative side. And you can say, well, yes, God is very loving. But in the end, you've got to be good or he won't love you. Everybody comes down on one or the other. Everybody says law is the reality and love is secondary. In other words, basically the promises and blessings of God are conditional. Or they say, no, love is more real than law. Love is the important thing. The law is secondary and therefore they believe that the blessings of God are basically unconditional.

And so everybody, because they don't understand how to resolve this tension at the heart of the covenant, tends to slide toward relativism or moralism, toward being a sadducee or being a Pharisee, toward basically feeling like, I pretty much can live the way I want to, ultimately, because God's going to love me anyway, or feeling guilt-ridden and condemned because you're never living up.

But the Bible doesn't resolve it all through the Hebrew scriptures, all through the Old Testament. And there's one place where God actually says, in Judges 2, verse 1, I said, I would never break my covenant with you. And then two verses later he says, I also said, I will not bless you if you disobey me.

Michael Wilcock, who is a commentator, writing a comment here on the book of Judges, puts it like this. It's almost as if God is saying, I have sworn to bless you, and I also have sworn not to bless a disobedient people. What is this you have done to me? And by what fearful means do you think I am to solve this situation?

Well, how do you resolve it? How do you resolve it? The answer is in the second half of verse 13, because in the second half of verse 13 it says that he may be your God as he promised you and as he swore to your father's Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Now, where did God take the covenant oath? Where did God take the oath? And where did he take the oath to Abraham? It's in Genesis 15. And if you understand what happens in Genesis 15, you are at the very heart of what the Bible is all about.

In Genesis 15, God has said to Abraham, I will bless you. But Abraham says, how do I know? How can I be sure? So God says, well here's what I want you to do. I want you to kill some animals and to cut the animals into pieces and arrange the pieces in two rows with an aisle so you can walk through them. Now you and I are utterly confused by that, but Abraham wasn't. Because in those days when a great Lord wanted to make a covenant with a peon or a peasant or a lesser vassal or servant, that's how it was done. Animals were slain, the pieces were arranged, and when the servant took the oath of loyalty to the Lord, the servant did so as he was walking between the pieces. Why? He was acting out the curse of the covenant. He was saying, I swear loyalty to you, O Lord, and if I do not keep my promise, may I be cut into pieces like this.

So Abraham figured if he was arranging a situation for a covenant ceremony, and so he cut the pieces up and he expected that he would be called to walk through because the Lord's never walked through the pieces. So he waited, and he waited. And then all of a sudden Genesis 15 tells us, incredible darkness came down. It was the darkness of judgment, and in the midst of the darkness was God. He appeared as a smoking fiery pillar just like at Mount Sinai later on. And he passed through the pieces as he promised to bless Abraham.

Now Abraham was startled, and almost every commentator who's ever tried to come to grips with Genesis 15 is startled, because what that means is God is not just saying, I will bless you, but he's promising to die if he doesn't bless him. He's promising to be torn to pieces if he doesn't bless Abraham. Well, that's amazing. Sure, it's amazing, but that's not all. Abraham had two shocks. The first shock was that God went through the pieces, but the second shock was that Abraham was never called to go through the pieces himself. The ceremony ended, and we're told in chapter 15, verse 18, and therefore God made a covenant with Abraham, but this was unheard of. Unheard of. It was amazing for the Lord to come and walk through the pieces, but for the servant not even to make the oath?

Do you know what that meant? Abraham knew what it meant, though he didn't see how it could be. It meant God was making the promise for both of them, and he was taking the curse of the covenant on for both of them. And what he was doing was he was saying, not only will I be torn to pieces if I don't keep my promise. I'll be torn to pieces if you don't. Oh, Abraham, Abraham, God is saying, and to all of us, oh, world, I will bless you no matter what. Even if it means that my immortality must become mortal. Even if my glory must be drowned in darkness, even if I have to literally be torn to pieces, and he was.

Because centuries later, darkness came down on Mount Calvary, thick darkness, and the midst of the darkness, there was God in the person of Jesus Christ, and he was literally being torn to pieces, nails, spears, thorns. Why? He was taking the covenant curse. And it's Paul, who says, Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us. He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to us all through Jesus Christ.

You know what that means? This is the answer to all the riddles. Paul says in Romans 4, this is how God can be both just and justifier of those who believe. I mean, this is the ultimate blend of law and love. How so? Don't you see? Class? Are the blessings of God conditional or unconditional? Yes. Yes, why? Because on the cross, Jesus Christ absolutely fulfilled the conditions of the law so that God could love you absolutely unconditionally. With his perfect life, Jesus Christ completely fulfilled the terms of the covenant, verse 9, and he earned the blessing. But with his sacrificial death, he completely fulfilled the curse of the covenant. And that leaves the blessing for you and me, and anyone who lifts the empty hands of faith and asks for it.

Jesus Christ fulfilled the conditions of the covenant so that we could be received unconditionally. And that is the reason why when my wife and I, 33 years ago, Kathy and I walked out of a class in Old Testament covenant theology, 33 years ago this month. And for the first time that was explained to us, Jesus' perfect life earned the blessing, his sacrificial death, took the curse, that leaves the blessing for you. That's what God Paul is saying in Genesis in Galatians 3. When we walked out, we looked at each other and we said, I think I finally understand the gospel. We said it to each other. Do you?

And if you do, let me just quickly apply this. If you understand this finally, number one, it will lead you into paradoxical obedience. What do I mean by paradoxical obedience? Until you grasp the covenant, until you grasp covenant theology, until you grasp the gospel. I said, you have a tendency to either look at the law as something that is you've got obey or God's going to get you. So you either look at the blessings of God as conditional. So you're always feeling like I'm not living up. You always feel kind of a sense of condemnation. Or you basically believe God just loves everybody unconditionally. And you feel like the law is a good thing, but you don't take it all that seriously.

But when you understand that Jesus Christ fulfilled the conditions at radical, infinite cost to himself, so that we could be loved unconditionally. Now, when I look at the law of God, first of all, the law of God is the conditions of the covenant. And I say, I've got to take those things seriously, really seriously, because Jesus died to fulfill this. This is important. And so with all my might, I try to obey. With every fiber of my being, I try to obey the will and will of God in terms of the covenant. But when I fail, and I will fail, and I do fail, I know there's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. Because my obedience is a way of saying thank you to God. And it's a way of becoming like God, but it's not a way of earning my way into God.

And therefore, if you understand the gospel, there's this fascinating balance in your attitude toward the law. You resist sin like crazy, and you never have a sense of condemnation and despair when you fall into it. Huh? Isn't that amazing? And no one else has that kind of balance.

So first of all, it leads to paradoxical obedience. Secondly, it leads to absolute trust. It's scary to get married, you know why? Because two people say, I'm going to give everything for you. How do you know? How do they know? How do they know about you? How do you know about you? See, when two people come together, you say, I'm going to sacrifice for you. I'm going to give my life for you. I'm going to do everything for you. And you're not really sure whether the other person will do it. You're not even sure if you will do it. It's kind of scary to get married. That's another sermon.

But when Jesus Christ calls you into a covenant relationship, you know what He's saying? I want to marry you. I want you to come into a legally binding, intimate love relationship with me. I want to marry you, but you don't have to be uncertain because I've already taken the plunge of love. I've already gone to the mat. I've already died for you. Oh, trust him. What more could anyone do than that?

Thirdly, covenant theology not only gives you paradoxical obedience and absolute trust, it also leads to church membership. Oh yeah, you know why? Because once you understand the gospel, accountability is not this horrible thing. In fact, you also understand accountability is good for you. And therefore, throughout the history of the Bible, you'll see that people who get into a covenant relationship with each other are also in a covenant relationship with God, are also in a covenant relationship with others who have that covenant relationship with God. They are accountable to other believers. They don't just come to church like a consumer, but they covenant and they say, I'm accountable. I support. I'm responsible here. In other words, they join the churches. They don't just come.

Do you understand the gospel? That's one of the implications. Paradoxical obedience, absolute trust, church membership, and getting serious, finally, about God. You see, modern spirituality gives you a wispy God who's kind of anything you want Him to be, but covenant theology gives you a crunchy God. A God that's real, a God that bites back.

C.S. Lewis puts it like this.

> "An impersonal God, well and good. A subject of God of beauty, truth and goodness inside our own heads. Better still. A formless life force, surging through everyone, a vast power which we can all tap. Best of all. But a living God, pulling at the other end of the cord, approaching at infinite speed, the hunter, the covenant lord, the husband, that is quite another matter. There comes a moment when people who have been dabbling in religion suddenly draw back. Supposing you really find Him, we never meant it to come to that. We're still supposing He found you. If there is a God, you are in a sense alone with Him. You cannot put Him off with speculations about your neighbor's hypocrisy or memories of what you have read in books. What will all that chatter in hearsay count when the anesthetic fog, we call the real world, fades away, and the divine presence in which you have always stood, becomes palpable, immediate and unavoidable."

I invite you into a serious relationship with a covenant God.

Let's pray.

Our Father, give us a deep understanding of the gospel. So our lives can really be changed, buy it and through it. We thank You for giving us Your Son. And therefore, we now, in turn, give You ourselves. We pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.

### 引言：立约关系

我们如何分享真正认识耶稣的意义？不仅仅是作为一个历史人物或道德教师，而是作为救主和君王。本月，Tim Keller 探讨圣经如何展示我们在信仰上公开，并分享我们在基督里的希望。我们的经文来自申命记 29-23。

摩西召集了所有以色列人，对他们说，你们亲眼看见了耶和华在埃及对法老、对他所有官员和他全地所做的一切。你们亲眼看见了那些伟大的试炼，那些神迹和大奇事。但直到今天，耶和华没有赐给你们能明白的心、能看见的眼和能听见的耳。谨慎遵守这约的条款，使你们在所做的一切事上都可以亨通。

> “今天你们所有人都站在耶和华你们神的面前，你们的领袖和首领，你们的长老和官员，以及以色列的所有其他人，连同你们的孩子和妻子，以及住在你们营中的外邦人，他们砍柴挑水。你们站在这里是为了与耶和华你们的神立约。这是耶和华今天与你们立的约，并以誓言封印。确认你们今天作为他的子民，使他可以成为你们的神，正如他应许你们的，并如他向你们的祖先亚伯拉罕、以撒和雅各所起的誓。”

我不仅与你们今天站在我们面前的立这约和誓言，也与那些今天不在这里的人立约。你们自己知道我们在埃及如何生活，以及我们在去这里的路上经过的国家。你们在他们中间看到了那些可憎的偶像和木石、金银的偶像。确保今天在你们中间没有人或女人、家族或部落的心转离耶和华我们的神，去敬拜那些国家的神。确保在你们中间没有产生这种苦毒毒根的根。

这是耶和华的话。

### 立约的独特性

我们一直在说，申命记是一系列摩西在他去世前不久所讲的讲道。如果摩西认为与神立约关系如此重要，以至于几乎是他去世前说的最后一件事，那么我们就应该弄清楚这是什么。与神立约关系是什么？

如果我们带着这个问题阅读这段经文，我们将学到三件事。立约的独特性，立约的奥秘，以及立约的英雄。独特性，奥秘，和英雄。

首先是独特性。人们常常会说，也许有人已经在想，难道你不能想出一个比“立约”更不古老的词吗？你没有一个比“立约”更现代的词吗？答案是否定的。没有更现代的词，因为现代社会和文化实际上已经没有这个类别了。

如果你想了解什么是立约，请看第12节和第13节的开头。你们站在这里是为了与耶和华你们的神立约。这是耶和华今天与你们立的约，并以誓言封印，确认你们今天作为他的子民。

请注意两件事。一方面，注意爱的语言和亲密的语言，个人所有格代词。你看，例如，它说，我们是他的子民，不仅仅是一个子民。他是我们的神，不仅仅是神。每当你听到使用个人所有格代词时，你就知道它在谈论一种亲密的关系。

所以，如果你只是听到一个你甚至不认识的人在谈论“我的约翰尼”或“我的苏西”，你会假设那个人在谈论孩子、配偶或非常亲近的人，非常亲密的人。所以首先，当你看一个立约时，你会看到爱的语言和亲密的语言。

然而，其次，你会看到法律的语言。看，封印誓言以确认，你就有了。什么是立约？立约是一种关系，但它是一种比仅仅法律关系更有爱和亲密的关系，但比仅仅个人关系更具约束力、持久性和责任感。这是一种惊人的结合。

立约是法律和爱的惊人结合。它令人惊叹，因为它是一种通过自愿、互相约束的承诺和誓言来爱的个人关系，无论环境如何，都要忠诚。这就是立约。

现在，现代社会实际上没有这个类别，因为现代社会让一切都围绕着体验个体自我和个体自我的幸福和满足。在现代社会中，你的个体幸福和满足以及权利是绝对的，其他一切都是手段。所有其他机构，所有其他关系。

所以在现代社会中，关系越来越多地开始这样。两个人互相看着对方说，我会成为我应该成为的人，只要你也是你应该成为的人。如果你不是，我就走了。

但在立约中，两个人互相看着对方说，我会成为我应该成为的人，无论你是否成为你应该成为的人。我会成为我应该成为的人，无论你是否成为你应该成为的人。因此，进入立约是可怕的。只有当立约中的双方都这样说时，它才有效。

在立约关系中，双方都必须说，即使你不是你应该成为的人，我也会成为我应该成为的人。现在，如果只有一个人这样说，而另一个人没有，那么你得到的是剥削甚至虐待。但如果你真的进入一个立约关系，其中双方都在说，你比我更重要。关系比我的需求更重要。我会在我的需求之前致力于你的需求。我会致力于关系，即使它目前没有满足我的需求。我把我的独立性给你。我把我的一部分自由作为爱的礼物给你。

如果一方和另一方都在说。如果双方都在说，我不是在追求我的需求，我在追求你的需求。我会为你牺牲。如果双方都在说，那是一种比消费者关系更令人满足、更深刻和深远、更能改变生活和快乐的关系，在消费者关系中，每一方都说，只要你满足我的需求，我就会在其中。

现在，我不想给你印象，所有关系都应该是立约关系。你应该有消费者关系。例如，我认识我的杂货商。我的杂货商认识我。杂货商，我猜，我去杂货店？他们认识我。我认识他们，说，嗨，嗨。但如果我找到一个更近的杂货店，食物更好，价格更低，我就走了。我就走了，因为那是一个消费者关系，而不是一个立约关系。

所以我们的许多关系应该是这样的。在光谱的一端，它们是。在另一端，你有婚姻。父母和孩子之间的关系。你有立约关系。在中间，你有各种各样的关系。有些朋友，最亲密的朋友更具立约性。有些则不那么多。

但这是我的观点。这是重点。如果最深刻、最快乐、最能改变生活、最深刻和光荣的关系是立约关系，那么你与神的关系必须是彻头彻尾的立约关系。这必须是。

现在，这就是问题所在。现代人，如我所说，他们无法将法律和爱结合在一起。他们说，哦，我是属灵的，但我不是宗教的。社会学家多年来，我一直发现现代人喜欢说，我是属灵的，但不是宗教的，这是什么意思？这是什么意思。我相信上帝。我想要与上帝建立关系，但我不想去一个机构。我不想去教堂或犹太教堂。我不想让人们告诉我必须相信什么。我不想放弃我的自由。我不想放弃决定对我来说什么是对或错的权利。

换句话说，每个人都在说，我想要与上帝建立个人关系，但不是立约关系。但圣经说，这是不可能的，上帝只在立约的基础上与人建立关系。每次他与某人建立关系，亚当、亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各、大卫、摩西，总是立约的。

所以这是第一点。独特性，一种打破类别的东西是立约关系，法律和爱的结合，创造了最深刻、最满足、最能改变生活的关系，最重要的是，与上帝建立关系的唯一方式。

### 立约的奥秘

然而，第二点，我们在这里学到的第二件事是，这种立约关系有一个奥秘。现在，我的意思是什么？所有的立约都有条款或条件，因为所有的合同都有条款和条件。立约不仅仅是合同，但不少于合同。所有的合同都有条款或条件，如果你满足条款或条件，就会有奖励或祝福。如果你未能满足它们，或者如果你违反了条款或条件，就会有惩罚，或者用圣经的术语来说，诅咒。

所以在第9节中，你看到，它说，谨慎遵守这约的条款，使你们在所做的一切事上都可以亨通。看，那是立约的祝福。谨慎遵守条件。但然后，到了第18节，它说，但确保今天在你们中间没有人或女人、家族或部落的心转离耶和华我们的神，去敬拜其他神。这进入了谈论诅咒的经文区域。如果你违反了立约，就会有惩罚。这就是合同有价值的原因。我的意思是，如果没有惩罚，合同有什么用？这就是保持人们诚实的原因。这是你承诺的骨干。

然而，听着，当你继续，让我继续阅读。我们没有打印到第19、20、21节，但让我继续阅读这段经文。它说，不要让任何人或女人、家族或部落开始敬拜其他神。它说，主，这是第20节，主永远不会原谅这样做的人。他的愤怒和热情将燃烧在那人身上。书中写的所有诅咒都会降临在他身上。主将根据这本法律书中写的所有诅咒给他带来灾难。

现在，等一下。当你听到它说，如果你违反了立约，我永远不会原谅你。永远不会。如果你违反了立约，所有的诅咒都会降临。你说，等一下。我以为上帝是一个宽恕的上帝。然而，当然，如果他是一个立约的上帝，立约有什么用？如果你只是忽略惩罚，说，好吧，谁在乎？我会原谅你。

在这一点上，理解立约让我们进入圣经的核心奥秘。并让我们直接进入圣经的核心信息。因为如果你通读圣经，持有新约，在每一页每一本书中，不仅仅是一些书，不仅仅是旧约或新约，在每一页每一本书中，你都有这样的声明，上帝说，我不能祝福不顺从的人民。我不能。你必须顺从。我是一个公正的法官。我不能对罪恶视而不见。一个对有罪者视而不见的地方法官会被赶出城。更何况我呢？你必须顺从。我不能忽视它。我不能祝福不顺从的人民。

有一整套，有数百个这样的声明。但在旧约和新约的每一页每一本书中，也有数百个声明说，我永远不会离开你或放弃你。我永远会接受你。我永远不会抛弃你。一次又一次。如果你定期阅读诗篇，你会在同一首诗篇中一次又一次地猜测。你有上帝说，我只能祝福你如果你这样做。其他时候，上帝说，无论如何我都会祝福你。

多年前我有一位教授说，这是...这种看似不可调和的紧张。这种看似无法解决的紧张是圣经所有其他情节线下的情节线。这是推动圣经叙事前进的东西。因为你看到人们，你看到上帝的人民失败和失败，然后问题出现了，上帝会屈服于他的人民并接受他们所做的一切，那么他的圣洁怎么办？或者上帝会放弃他的人民吗？但那他的信实呢？

让我从神学上对你说，这是叙事上的。上帝的祝福是有条件的还是无条件的？这是问题。班级。上帝的祝福是有条件的吗？你必须做好，你必须履行杯子。还是无条件的，无论你做什么，你都会得到它们。

有一个条件的等级。现在听。问题是圣经一次又一次地似乎给出矛盾的答案。这是如此普遍，以至于几乎每个人都倾向于在一方或另一方，而不是遵循圣经的平衡。我是什么意思？大多数人要么落入一方或另一方。大多数人要么以自由的方式阅读圣经。也就是说，他们说，是的，你需要顺从。是的，你应该遵守十诫。是的，你应该做好。但最终上帝爱每个人并会接受每个人。

或者你可以站在保守的一边。你可以说，好吧，是的，上帝非常有爱心。但最终，你必须做好，否则他不会爱你。每个人都在一方或另一方。每个人都说法律是现实，爱是次要的。换句话说，基本上上帝的承诺和祝福是有条件的。或者他们说，不，爱比法律更真实。爱是重要的事情。法律是次要的，因此他们相信上帝的祝福基本上是无条件的。

因此，每个人，因为他们不明白如何解决立约核心的紧张，倾向于滑向相对主义或道德主义，倾向于成为撒都该人或法利赛人，倾向于基本上觉得，我几乎可以按照我想要的方式生活，最终，因为上帝无论如何都会爱我，或者感到内疚和谴责，因为你从未达到。

但圣经没有解决整个希伯来圣经，整个旧约。实际上有一个地方，上帝实际上说，在士师记2章第1节，我说，我永远不会与你们破坏我的约。然后两节之后他说，我也说过，如果你不顺从我，我就不会祝福你。

迈克尔·威尔科克，他是一位评论员，在这里写了一篇关于士师记的评论，他这样说。这几乎就像上帝在说，我已经发誓要祝福你们，我也发誓不祝福不顺从的人民。你对我做了什么？你认为我将通过什么可怕的手段来解决这个问题？

那么，你如何解决它？你如何解决它？答案在第13节的后半部分，因为在第13节的后半部分，它说，使他可以成为你们的神，正如他应许你们的，并如他向你们的祖先亚伯拉罕、以撒和雅各所起的誓。现在，上帝在哪里立下了立约的誓言？上帝在哪里立下誓言？他在哪里向亚伯拉罕立下誓言？在创世记15章。如果你理解创世记15章中发生的事情，你就处于圣经的核心。

在创世记15章，上帝对亚伯拉罕说，我会祝福你。但亚伯拉罕说，我怎么知道？我怎么能确定？所以上帝说，好吧，这就是我想让你做的。我想让你杀一些动物，把动物切成碎片，把碎片排列成两排，中间有一条走道，这样你就可以走过它们。现在你和我对此完全困惑，但亚伯拉罕没有。因为在那些日子里，当一个伟大的领主想要与一个农奴或农民或较低的附庸或仆人立约时，就是这样做的。动物被杀，碎片被排列，当仆人向领主宣誓效忠时，仆人是在走过碎片时这样做的。为什么？他是在演绎立约的诅咒。他在说，我向你宣誓效忠，哦，主，如果我不履行我的承诺，愿我被切成碎片。

所以亚伯拉罕认为，如果他正在安排一个立约仪式的情况，所以他切碎了碎片，他预计他会被叫去走过，因为主从未走过碎片。所以他等待，等待。然后突然，创世记15章告诉我们，令人难以置信的黑暗降临。这是审判的黑暗，在黑暗中是上帝。他以冒烟的火柱出现，就像后来在西奈山一样。他走过碎片，承诺祝福亚伯拉罕。

现在亚伯拉罕感到震惊，几乎每个试图理解创世记15章的评论员都感到震惊，因为这意味着上帝不仅在说，我会祝福你，而是他承诺如果他不祝福他就会死。他承诺如果他不祝福亚伯拉罕就会被撕成碎片。好吧，这很惊人。当然，这很惊人，但这还不是全部。亚伯拉罕有两个震惊。第一个震惊是上帝走过了碎片，但第二个震惊是亚伯拉罕从未被叫去走过碎片。仪式结束了，我们在第15章第18节中被告知，因此上帝与亚伯拉罕立了约，但这是前所未闻的。前所未闻的。主走过碎片是惊人的，但仆人甚至没有宣誓？

你知道这意味着什么吗？亚伯拉罕知道这意味着什么，尽管他没有看到它是如何可能的。这意味着上帝为他们俩做出了承诺，他承担了立约的诅咒。他在做的是他说，不仅如果我不履行我的承诺，我会被撕成碎片。如果你不履行，我也会被撕成碎片。哦，亚伯拉罕，亚伯拉罕，上帝在说，向我们所有人，哦，世界，我会祝福你无论如何。即使这意味着我的不朽必须变得凡人。即使我的荣耀必须淹没在黑暗中，即使我必须被字面上撕成碎片，他也是。

因为几个世纪后，黑暗降临在加略山，浓密的黑暗，在黑暗中，有上帝以耶稣基督的身份，他被字面上撕成碎片，钉子，矛，荆棘。为什么？他承担了立约的诅咒。保罗说，基督救赎我们脱离律法的诅咒，成为我们的诅咒。他救赎我们是为了使亚伯拉罕的祝福通过耶稣基督临到我们所有人。

你知道这意味着什么吗？这是所有谜题的答案。保罗在罗马书4章中说，这就是上帝如何既是公义的，又是信徒的称义者。我的意思是，这是法律和爱的终极结合。怎么会这样？你不明白吗？班级？上帝的祝福是有条件的还是无条件的？是的。是的，为什么？因为在十字架上，耶稣基督完全履行了法律的条件，以便上帝可以完全无条件地爱你。通过他完美的生活，耶稣基督完全履行了立约的条款，第9节，他赢得了祝福。但通过他的牺牲性死亡，他完全履行了立约的诅咒。这为你和我留下了祝福，以及任何举起信仰的空手并请求它的人。

耶稣基督履行了立约的条件，以便我们可以无条件地被接纳。这就是为什么当我和我的妻子，33年前，凯西和我走出一堂旧约立约神学课，33年前的这个月。第一次向我们解释，耶稣的完美生活赢得了祝福，他的牺牲性死亡，承担了诅咒，这为你留下了祝福。这就是保罗在加拉太书3章中所说的。当我们走出来时，我们互相看着对方，我们说，我想我终于明白了福音。我们对彼此说。你呢？

如果你明白，让我快速应用一下。如果你终于明白了，第一，它会引导你进入矛盾的顺从。我所说的矛盾的顺从是什么意思？直到你掌握了立约，直到你掌握了立约神学，直到你掌握了福音。我说，你有一种倾向，要么把法律看作是你必须遵守的东西，否则上帝会惩罚你。所以你要么把上帝的祝福看作是有条件的。所以你总是觉得我没有达到。你总是感到一种谴责感。或者你基本上相信上帝无条件地爱每个人。你觉得法律是件好事，但你并不太认真对待它。

但当你理解耶稣基督以激进、无限的代价履行了条件，以便我们可以无条件地被爱。现在，当我看上帝的法律时，首先，上帝的法律是立约的条件。我说，我必须认真对待这些事情，真的很认真，因为耶稣为了履行这一点而死。这很重要。因此，我尽全力去顺从。用我身体的每一根纤维，我努力顺从上帝的旨意和立约的意志。但当我失败时，我会失败，我确实失败，我知道在基督耶稣里没有谴责。因为我的顺从是对上帝说谢谢的一种方式。这是一种变得像上帝的方式，但不是一种进入上帝的方式。

因此，如果你理解福音，在你对法律的态度中有这种迷人的平衡。你像疯了一样抵制罪恶，当你陷入其中时，你从未感到谴责和绝望。嗯？这不是很神奇吗？没有人有那种平衡。

所以首先，它导致矛盾的顺从。其次，它导致绝对的信任。结婚是可怕的，你知道为什么吗？因为两个人说，我会为你付出一切。你怎么知道？他们怎么知道？他们怎么知道你？你怎么知道你？看，当两个人走到一起时，你说，我会为你牺牲。我会为你付出我的生命。我会为你做一切。而你并不真正确定另一个人是否会这样做。你甚至不确定你是否会这样做。结婚有点可怕。这是另一个讲道。

但当耶稣基督呼召你进入立约关系时，你知道他在说什么吗？我想嫁给你。我想让你进入一个法律约束的、亲密的爱情关系。我想嫁给你，但你不必不确定，因为我已经采取了爱的跳跃。我已经走到了垫子上。我已经为你而死。哦，信任他。还有谁能做得比这更多？

第三，立约神学不仅给你矛盾的顺从和绝对的信任，它还导致教会成员资格。哦，是的，你知道为什么吗？因为一旦你理解了福音，问责制就不是这种可怕的事情。事实上，你也明白问责制对你有好处。因此，贯穿圣经的历史，你会看到那些与彼此建立立约关系的人也与上帝建立立约关系，也与其他与上帝建立立约关系的人建立立约关系。他们对其他信徒负责。他们不仅像消费者一样来教堂，而是立约，他们说，我负责。我支持。我在这里负责。换句话说，他们加入教会。他们不仅仅是来。

你理解福音吗？这是其中一个含义。矛盾的顺从，绝对的信任，教会成员资格，最后认真对待上帝。你看，现代灵性给你一个模糊的上帝，他是你想要的任何东西，但立约神学给你一个真实的上帝。一个真实的上帝，一个会反击的上帝。

C.S.路易斯这样说。

> “一个非人格的上帝，好吧。一个在我们自己头脑中的美、真理和善良的上帝。更好。一个无形的生命力，涌动在每个人中，一个我们都可以利用的巨大力量。最好。但一个活生生的上帝，在绳子的另一端拉着，以无限的速度接近，猎人，立约的主，丈夫，那是完全不同的事情。有一个时刻，那些一直在宗教中涉猎的人突然退缩。假设你真的找到了他，我们从未想过会到那一步。更糟的是，假设他找到了你。如果有一个上帝，你在某种意义上是与他独处的。你不能用关于你邻居的虚伪的推测或你读过的书的记忆来推脱他。当我们称为现实世界的麻醉雾消失时，所有的喋喋不休和道听途说会有什么用，和你一直站立的神圣存在变得可感、直接和不可避免。”

我邀请你进入与立约上帝的严肃关系。

让我们祷告。

我们的父，给我们对福音的深刻理解。这样我们的生活才能真正被它改变，通过它。我们感谢你赐给我们你的儿子。因此，我们现在，反过来，把自己献给你。我们奉耶稣的名祷告。阿门。
