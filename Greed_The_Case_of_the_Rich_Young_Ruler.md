today's teaching, Tim Keller looks at how the Bible's teaching on sin gives us a deeply  honest and yet incredibly hopeful view of the world. Father, I want to congratulate you for how well you're saying amazing grace. Well, you never choir, we didn't have a trumpet, you know, and you did a great job, and I think  it's because after the number of years, the one of the ways you know you're a Christian  and you've been a Christian for a while is that your whole life flashes before you when  you sing that. You know, you know, this incredible film of your entire life is sort of biography, A&E  biography, but it's you, it's going by, and I know enough of you, and I know enough  of your biography is to watch you sing, and I know it's happening to you too. And it's a good mark of a church.

This living up to its name when people sing it that well. Let's look at this passage to which our thoughts have to be focused, and we're going to see  Matthew 19, 16 to 25, it's printed in your bulletin, we're going to read that and base  our teaching on it, Matthew 19, 16 to 25. Now a man came up to Jesus and asked, teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal  life? Why do you ask me about what is good Jesus replied, there is only one who is good. If you want to enter life, obey the commandments, which ones the man inquired?

Jesus replied, do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony,  honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as yourself. All these I have kept, the young man said, what do I still lack? Jesus answered, if you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor,  and you will have treasure in heaven, then come follow me. When the young man heard this, he went away sad because he had great wealth. Then Jesus said to his disciples, I tell you the truth, it's hard for a rich man to enter  the kingdom of heaven.

Again, I tell you, it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than  for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God, and then the disciples heard this. They were greatly astonished and asked, who then can be saved? This is God's word. This is the very famous story of the rich young ruler, rich young man, and he was rich in  two ways. He had both great moral wealth and great financial wealth, you notice?

First of all, he has great moral wealth, he's a very decent person, a person characterized  by moral excellence. So when Jesus actually enumerates many of the ten commandments, don't murder, don't commit  adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother, love your  neighbor as yourself. He says, bingo. I do that. Let's assume that he was certainly telling the truth, and that anyone who knew him would  say, yes, here is a man characterized by moral excellence.

Here is a man who is characterized by sexual purity, he's a loving son, he's a great citizen,  he's a man of integrity and honesty. Let's just assume that this is true. Not only that, we're told he was wealthy, he had many possessions. Back then, as well as now, there's a kind of unconscious, and sometimes conscious, feeling  that those two things go together, that if you do good, you'll do well, and if you've  done well, it's because you did good. I remember when Maria in Sound of Music, the main character in Sound of Music, was about  to marry a rich guy.

She realizes she's going to marry a rich guy. So she sings a song, and she says, somewhere in my youth or childhood, remember? I must have done something good. I must be a pretty good person, or God wouldn't be rewarding me like this, and of course,  this is the reverse of what Job's friend's song, when Job fell into poverty and disease,  they essentially said, somewhere in your youth or childhood, you must have done something  bad. It must be something wrong.

And there's a feeling, it's hard to describe, and nobody wants to articulate it, feeling  that if you live a good life, then God will reward you by giving you a certain amount  of prosperity. And so in a sense, you characterized by moral excellence, obviously rewarded by God  by being given a prosperous life. And so as he approaches Jesus, it seems like here is the ideal person, any religious leader,  any religious leader you can imagine would say, this is the kind of guy I'm looking for. This is the kind of person I want. Not only is he a man characterized by moral excellence, not only is he a man whose life is  varied together in all sorts of ways, but he's even willing to admit there's something  he lacks.

I mean, this is great to have a rich person who's willing to come to church and to say,  I'm still missing something, he's well pulled together in every way, he's got it all together. But even he's so together, he even admits that I don't have it all together. Yes, I still lack something. So he comes to Jesus and Jesus speaks strong with him and sends him packing. Here's the kind of guy that by modern standards, everybody would say, this is about as together  a person as a person can be.

And he's even willing to admit he has a spiritual need and he comes and asks, look, perfectly  legitimate question, what do I still lack? There's still something missing in my life spiritually. What do I lack? And Jesus gives him an outrageous strong answer, sends him away packing, shows him that he's  totally outside the kingdom of God. And when the disciples see it, they're absolutely astonished and they say, wait a minute, if  he's out, who in the world is in?

But this is to teach us, the Christianity is utterly and entirely different than anything  the human mind, the natural human mind can conceive of or think. And what's so alarming is that most of us are going to be in the very same boat. Even those of us who are able to somehow pull our lives together like he did, get ourselves  sort of morally together, self-discipline, self-control, economically together, career-wise  together. And there's plenty of people in New York who are like that and who still are willing  to admit I need something, but obviously it's possible to have all that, even the humility  to ask, even the humility to come and seek and be sent packing by Jesus. Why did he go away?

It says, sad. And that's kind of a weak word. I think the better translation is grieved. He went away grieved. That's how the old translation is to it.

How can we avoid going away grieved? This man had set out on a course of his life that looked like he had made every bit of  it. He was just lacking one thing. He wasn't sure what it is. I mean, he had put his career together.

He had built the steps up the mountain and he was almost at a top and he just, when he got  to the top, he realized, you know, I've almost made it. If there was just one more step, I can't quite reach the top. So he turns to Jesus and says, I just need that one more step. Jesus tells him, he's on a completely wrong road that he's far from the kingdom. How are we going to avoid being sent away by Jesus grieving?

In fact, I know, and this is a great thing about Redeemer, there's, there are dozens of  you right now, probably in similar situation, oh, maybe not rich and maybe not this together. But you're here saying, what do I lack? There's a danger that you could be sent away grieving. Why was it he sent away grieving? Why was it?

Why did he go away like that? I would say, unless we understand those, the four reasons I see, we might be in danger  of being sent away the same way. So let's take a look, there's four reasons. Each one is more serious than the last, four reasons that he went away grieving. The first reason is, let me just lay these out, and each one is more serious, therefore,  each one takes a little bit more thought.

The first one is, he went away grieving because he talked to the real Jesus. Now, I won't take long on this point, but I think you need to say this. One of the reasons why he was disturbed, it was because he was talking to the real Jesus  and he was hearing the real message of Jesus. When you talk to the real Jesus, you are always shocked. When you come up against his real message, you're always disturbed.

You're always disturbed. In fact, I'll go this far. This is the way you grow as a Christian. When you meet the real message of the gospel, you always find two things that are shocking. It demands more than you thought, and it offers more than you thought.

When you meet the real Jesus, you'll find he wants much more from you than you ever  thought, and he offers far more to you than you ever dreamed. And frankly, that's what it means to grow. The way you grow as a Christian, the way you know you've grown, is that a year ago, no  matter how long you've been a Christian, you're growing a year ago, you were much more ignorant  about these two things. Today, you see far more of what he's requiring. He requires a lot more than you ever thought, but he offers far more than you ever imagined.

That's what it means to be dealing with the real Jesus. And you see, whenever you actually do come up against the real Jesus, what always happens  you see that, and then you can only have one of two responses. You can either bow down and wonder and give yourself to him where you go away offended. One or the other. The other way offended, there's hope, because you could always think about it, at least  you've seen the truth, and you might come back.

But the one thing it's impossible is to have met the real Jesus and to be indifferent. And if there's anybody here who experiences one of the forms of indifference, in other  words, if you find Christianity laughable, irrelevant boring, or if you find Christianity  to be just a kind of sweet, comforting thing that it's nice to dip into occasionally. Or if you find Christianity kind of vaguely guilt-producing and kind of vaguely anxiety-ridden,  you haven't seen the real Jesus, because you are in the grip of indifference. Whenever you meet the real Jesus, he disturbs you, and that's the first reason he was disturbed. Secondly, the second reason he went away grieving was that Jesus smashed  two of his basic assumptions about how religion works.

Jesus smashed his religious views. Now what's really instructive for us is that the religious views that this young man had  are not just common in his day, but they're absolutely common today. You see, he came knowing that he was lacking something. He needed some kind of spiritual experience, at least. He wasn't sure about his relationship with God.

He says, what must I do to inherit eternal life? I don't think he meant he didn't know that he had it. I think it meant he wasn't sure he had it. And he wasn't sure about his relationship with God, and he lacked a certain kind of peace  in the center. So he comes and he asks.

And you see, the way he approaches it is based on two assumptions. The way he looks for this peace, it may seem honest. When you first look at it, it seems very sincere, but the fact of the matter is he  is approaching God on the basis of two assumptions that Jesus utterly smashes. And those two assumptions are that Christianity is something you can add and Christianity is  something you can do. Christianity is something you can add and you can do.

First of all, people assume he assumed that Christianity was something you can just add  to your life, a kind of way of sort of furnishing your life out, filling your life out. It's like you're listening. Let's just say you're a conductor and you're listening to the music and you say, there's  one of the notes isn't coming out, you see, one of the lines, I can't hear it. And a lot of people say, that's what I need. I've had a pretty good life.

I need to sort of round myself out. I need to add something. So he says, what do I still lack? He goes to Jesus and says, what can I add? But Jesus' response, as we will see later, is to make an outrageous request.

And what he's really doing, what Jesus is really doing is saying, this Christianity is  not something you add. Christianity is more like an explosion that destroys everything you have to make way  for something new. Christianity isn't something you add. Christianity is starting completely afresh. Remember Nicodemus?

He was also, and he wasn't a rich young man. He was a rich old man. And he said, he comes to Jesus by night, John chapter three, and he says, essentially,  he says the same thing. He says, you're a good teacher. And I'm a ruler in Israel.

But I just feel like I lack something. What do I still lack? And Jesus goes, boom, you must be born again. You must be completely redone. Everything has to be smashed.

Young man, he's saying, you don't need one more rung to get over the top of the mountain. What I have, revolutionizes everything. What I have, smashes through the mountain, it's a whole new approach. And so what really Jesus is saying is, utterly Christianity is not something you add. It's something that completely revolutionizes.

But then, the other assumption, you can't just bring Jesus Christ in as an addition. He doesn't just furnish you out. He's not another book on your shelf. Okay. He's not another file on your hard drive, you know, that just somehow gives you more power.

You know, he's not, he's not something you just add and say, wow, look how much more  powerful my program is now. Oh no. Oh no. He's a whole new program. He doesn't just add and boot up your program.

But then the second thing that the young man does is he thinks that Christianity is something  you do. He says, what good thing should I do? And Jesus again, is absolutely blunt. He says, there's only one good. And in a minute, we'll see, he also asked the man to do something that is utterly impossible.

In other words, Jesus Christ says, I want you to know that it's getting to God is not  a matter of goodness. Nobody can be good enough, nobody can be moral enough. And then look at the furious logic. He says, take all of your wealth, O rich man, and sell it all and give it to the poor and  follow me. What is he doing?

It's brilliant. He says, oh, you will be all the ten commandments, do you? Well, let's just start with the first one. Let's just take the first one. The first one is, you see, love God with all your heart, soul strength in mind, have  no other guys before me.

All right. He says, let's try that one out. I want you to sell all of your money just because I, Jesus Christ, the Lord say so. How are you doing? He says, you see, if you God is really first in your life, everything in anything else  is trivial compared to God.

Everything in anything else is a bobble, it's a trinket. Nothing is compared to his cause, nothing is compared to his heart, nothing. Do you have any other guys before you? Before him? How does your heart work?

You see, what is he doing? He's saying, my dear friend, nobody loves God with all their heart, soul strength in  mind. Nobody loves their neighbor as themselves. Don't you see? Your problem, O rich young man, is not that you need a little more goodness.

Your problem is you won't admit what you know down deep that you're not good. And I can almost hear Jesus saying this. He's saying, the reason you come to me is because you know at some level that you're not good. Take a look at a needle, just get some sewing needle and look at it with a naked eye, and  it looks perfect, stainless, pure, spotless, brilliant, bright, but look at it under a microscope  and it's all pocked and misshapen. Now anybody who gets close enough into a heart will see the same thing.

One is a young minister, years ago, I made a terrible mistake, very often I would do funerals  and I very often did funerals for fine Christian men or women. And from what I can tell, you know from my naked eye, when I looked at them from where  I could see them, they looked just perfect, they were wonderful men and women have got. So I would do these glowing funeral sermons about how great this person was in the self-control  and the love and the ability and the wisdom I would watch the family, you know, squirming  their seats. Because if you look close enough at any heart, any human heart, it's all misshapen, it's  all pocked. And the rich young man knew that, he wouldn't admit it to himself, Jesus is trying to break  on through, no one is good.

You think Christianity is something you add, no, it's a revolution, you think Christianity  is something you do, no, it's something you receive. Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty and heartache. We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way and what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing this month, what is wrong with the world, Tim Keller  offers a clear and compassionate answer.

Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer, Dr. Keller shows how the reality  of sin explains the pain we see all around us and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom  and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes  or choices or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world will help you see  how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us. This newly released book, What Is Wrong with the World is our thanks for your gift this  month to help gospel and life share the good news of Jesus.

Every other religion in the world, every other philosophy in the world and every actually  even so-called common sense divides all humanity like this, like this. See it? Up here is the good, down here is the bad, hmm?

Up here is the moral, down here is the immoral, hmm? Up here is the nice, down here is the nasty. There's the religious, maybe down here is the irreligious, depends a little bit, but basically  everybody sees that that's the line. And Jesus comes through and says, no, the real line isn't a horizontal line, the real  line is a vertical line. And he says, I want you to know that there's really two ways to God.

Both nice and nasty people can do it on their own efforts or both nice and nasty people  no matter what you've done, no matter who you are, no matter how great, no matter how awful  you can come on a totally different basis. You can come on the basis, not of your efforts, but on the basis of my efforts until you see  that the real line going down the center of humanity in its attitude and its stance toward  God is not the horizontal, but the vertical. The vertical is the real one. It cuts across the horizontal, it makes minced meat of the horizontal on either side because  no matter how good you are on this side, Jesus says, you're not. It's only relative.

You're just a little less pocked and misshapen, no matter how far, and no matter how bad  you are on this side, as we'll see in a minute, you can come. In other words, this young man is good relatively speaking, relative to other people, he's very  good, it's his doctrine of goodness that's wrong. And as a result, he goes away grieving. Jesus has smashed his assumptions. These assumptions that virtually everybody else has, too.

Thirdly, the reason he went away grieving was because he was talking to the real Jesus. Secondly, because Jesus smashed his religious assumptions. Thirdly, he went away grieving because Jesus got personal. Now I would suggest to you that even though Jesus has contradicted his views, that's  not the real reason that he is so grieved. No.

Jesus refused to stay academic. This young man is like so many people. I've seen it for years. He believes, essentially, his problem is an academic one. He says, I'm missing something.

I don't know why, I feel, I don't know why, I feel kind of like there's something wrong. I'm missing something. Is it a doctrine that I have missed or don't understand? Is some project I ought to do that I don't know about, or is it some rule that I'm breaking  that I don't know about? What is it?

He's essentially saying, it's something I'm missing, something I'm missing in my thinking,  and he approaches it academically, and Jesus will not have it. I've seen this for years. People say, my real problem with Christianity is, I don't see how a God of love could punish  people. Or you say, my real problem with Christianity is, I just don't like it so exclusive, it seems  to leave out other religions. That's my problem.

Or you might say, my real problem is the whole idea of miracle. I just can't believe I was a modern person in miracle. Or you may say, well, you can even get a little less academic and you say, my real problem  is I have a bad habit and I can't break it, or I've got an issue that I just can't seem  to deal with. Or I've got something that I'm caught in and I don't know what I want to, you know,  I don't know that I really want to give it up or I don't know how to get out of it. So you get a little bit less academic, but Jesus Christ, see, the rich young man is like  this, but he has come to Jesus Christ who has the eye that pierces all the way through  all the smokescreens, all the pretence, all the camouflage, all the posturing.

And you know, in Mark, in Gospel of Mark, this same story is told, and Mark inserts something  very important in this story, you see, you know the place where he says, what still do  I lack? In the Gospel of Mark, he says, what still do I lack? And Mark says, Jesus looked at him and loved him and said, sell everything you've got. He looked at him and loved him. Now what's that mean?

It means he wasn't just looking at his face. It means he was reading his soul like a book. It means he said, I know this is going to hurt you, but I want you to know that I see  the real cancer, I see the real issue, I see the real thing that's killing you. You've got to get rid of all your money. Now, the only way to understand what Jesus is doing is to put this in context.

There is nobody else in the Bible who is, as far as I know, who is asked to give up everything  like that. Even Zacchaeus was only asked to give away half. In other words, there's no rule that says all Christians to follow Christ have got to  give up everything, all their money. There's no place that says you have to sell all your money and go into complete poverty. There's no place that says that.

So that means the way he's dealing with this young man is he's doing a drastic measure  of the way you deal with an alcoholic or a gambler. What Jesus is saying is, our difficulty, underneath all of our objections and underneath all  our complaints, the difficulty we really have is never the difficulty we really think  at first. Everybody I know who's really gone very far in the Christian life has found this out,  that what we thought in the beginning was the problem really isn't. Jesus Christ comes all the way in and says, underneath at all, there is a power struggle  that you have with God over your dreams. Carousel.

Musical. There's one place where one of the characters, Kerry Pippridge, sings a song about how  she can't wait to be married and have children. That's her great dream. And you know, she sings one of the most lyrical of all to ask her Hamirstine Rodgers songs. She sings, when the children are asleep will sit in dream.

But the night she sang that song, if Jesus Christ had come down to the middle of a carousel,  he'd walk over to Kerry Pippridge and he'd say, there's one thing that you lack. I want you to be willing to live a single life, all of your life for me. That's what he would do. He comes to Abraham and says, I want you to take your son, your only son, whom you love  and offer him up as a burn offering. He comes to the rich young man and says, you've got to give away all of your money.

What is he doing? Jesus Christ is saying, I want your dreams. There's a song that we sing in the evening service, starts Holy Father. You know that song? Some of you do.

Some of you come. And the main part of it's a short song, but the main part is we have to surrender all  our dreams. And what Jesus Christ says is, I want the most important thing in your life. That is the running sore. That is the cancer.

I want your dream. I want that through which you dream of a life of power and joy without God. I want the thing that you think will give you a life of power and joy without God. And until you have given it to me, not only we aren't right, but you don't know it,  it's killing you. The village voice, at the end of January, there was an article that made an awful lot  of, made a big flap, kind of a lot of publicity.

And the reason it was, it did, was because it was about the fact that unsafe sexes on  the rise again in big cities. And the person who wrote, the writer who wrote it, wrote as a person who had begun to get  back into unsafe sex. And at one point, the writer said this. The writer said, at first I was shocked at what I was doing, quote, I recoiled so much  from what I had done that it seemed to be not my choice at all. It was like a monster did it.

I recoiled so much from what I had done that it seemed to be not to be my choice at all. It was like a monster did it. But when you read through the article, at the end, the reflection goes on, and here's  how it ends. Yes, if you want to stay alive, you have to avoid wild anonymous, spontaneous, and explosive  sex. Then you have to ask, who are you?

What is life about? Now listen, because I'm not picking on sex as the greatest evil, just like Jesus is not  picking on money as the greatest evil. I'm not using this illustration because I'm a conservative and Jesus isn't using his  illustration because he's a liberal. The point is, anything that you have decided will give me a life of joy and power without  God becomes a monster. It does drive you.

It takes you out. Jesus looks at this and says, this is your monster. Jesus says anything, the reason he loves him when he says that he says, I have to tell you  this. I know it's going to hurt, but I love you. And the reason I'm telling you is, this is how you think you can have a life of power  and joy without God.

As a result, we've got to kill this thing before it kills you. The reason your life is out of control is because you're afraid of losing control to God. He says, give it to me and let me decide how much money you're going to have. Put me first. Be willing to part with anything, anything, change your attitude toward this.

Be willing to part with anything, anything, so he's saying to this man, he says, be willing  to walk away from it all. And let me decide how rich you're going to be. He says to carry pepperage, be willing to not be married at all. Let me decide that. He says to Abraham, be willing to not have any child.

We think the problem's academic. We think the problem's superficial. We think the problem's behavioral is there's a monster at the heart. Jesus says, surrender your dreams. Money can be a monster.

Money is so dangerous spiritually that even not having it can destroy you because of your  envy and your desire and you can kill yourself to get it. But the point is, it's not the money or the sex or the work per se as such. But it's money or sex that comes before Jesus. That's what Jesus is. It's money or sex or work as your fondest dream, as your deepest dream.

Jesus, I want it. You know how money can do it? I've seen people who don't have money. But if money is the way that they dream of a life of perfect control, we will use money  because we feel like it will give us a life of power. We'll be in charge of our lives.

We'll feel in control finally. People won't push us around. If you don't have it, the monster of money will fill you with anxiety. It will fill you with bitterness toward other people who have more than you. It will fill you with envy.

It will always make you worry about money. It will make you work too hard. It will make you trample on people. It was amazing how the new talk shows are pushing people into conflict. People will watch the talk shows that make people embarrassed and fight.

When recently somebody shot somebody after a talk show, the media called up, the newspaper  media called all the talk show and said, why are you still doing this? They said because people watch it, which means because people buy it, which means, yeah,  it's bad, but it makes us money. It's become a monster. Yeah, we're trampling on people, but it makes us money. And you know what's the worst thing that can happen is when you actually get the money.

When you become rich, you feel that it's because you're smart, because you're savvy,  and you get very confident about your hunches, and you get very confident about your beliefs. It's become a monster. Anything will. Jesus says, yes, you lack one thing. And what is that?

Here's the end. The fourth reason, see, he does lack one thing, it's not the giving away of the money. It's treasure in heaven. The reason that this young man has missed it all is because he doesn't understand treasure  in heaven. And Jesus Christ comes and says, you have to get rid of your monster.

You have to put me first, and that's the only way you'll ever get treasures in heaven. Oh, what are treasures in heaven? It means these two things, I have to really be brief here. Number one, it means to see that he is your treasure in heaven. Jesus is really saying is, I want you to give away everything.

What he means is, I want you to see that if you have me and only me, you're rich. And not just rich toward people, rich toward God. He's saying, young man, I know that you have the greatest estate in the district, but it's  nothing compared to my forgiveness. It's nothing compared to my righteousness. It's nothing compared to being adopted into the family of the Father.

It's nothing compared to what I can give you. Don't you see? Theaves can steal it, moth and rust can corrupt it, but what I give you is permanent. And if you don't see that I alone am good, but that as your Savior, if you rely on me  for your standing before God, you become good in me. You'll see that I'm your treasure, I'm your righteousness, I'm your record before God.

And if you have that, then it changes your attitude toward everything, money no longer  sacred. It's nothing compared to the treasure in heaven. You're free from worry, you're free from envy, you're free for generosity. But that's not it. The last thing is, if you want to understand treasure in heaven, you have to see that  he is your treasure in heaven, but lastly, you have to understand that you're his treasure  in heaven.

Jesus says when he sends his disciples out, they come back and they've been casting demons  out. And they say, this is great. We're doing miracles. And he says, rejoice not that the demons are subject to you, but rejoice that your name is  written in heaven. Oh, where's their name written in heaven?

Well, the Bible tells us in the Old Testament that the high priest who went in before God  used to had the names of every one of the children of Israel engraved on precious stones  over his heart when he went before God. And Jesus is our high priest. And in Isaiah 49, God says to Israel, can a woman forget the woman, can a woman forget the  baby that nurses at her breast, she may forget, but I will not forget the, look, I've engraved  you on the palms of my hands. If you put a tattoo here, you won't always see it. If you put a tattoo here, you won't always see, if you put a tattoo here, you won't obviously  but if you put a tattoo here, what is God saying?

He was saying, if you make my son your treasure, that makes you my treasure. Now when I see you, I see an absolute beauty, I see you radiant in Christ, I see you righteous  in Christ, I dot on you, I gaze on you. Is that the most exhilarating thought you can possibly have? Is that if you live in holy consciousness of this or do you take your identity from your  bank account or your dress size, don't you see the freedom that comes? Jesus says, you will only be free if you see that with me and me alone, you're rich.

And as John Newton once put it, since I have known the Savior's name and what for me  he bore, no more I toil for empty fame, I thirst for gold no more, placed by his hand in  this retreat, I make his love my theme and see that all the world calls great, his butt  a waking dream. If you come to him even though he's grieving you, you'll see he really loves you. Let's pray. Our Father, we ask that you would teach us not just how to be free from greed but how  to be free, period by seeing what your son has asked us for, everything. We look at you and we say, oh Lord Jesus Christ, we thought you were a great teacher, we  thought you were a great moralist, we came expecting a little additional help, we see  that you have to be our surety, our mediator, you have to be our prophet, our priest, our king,  our Alpha, our Omega, our everything and we ask that you would let that be the case, thereby  we will find the freedom that comes only to those who have submitted holy and utterly  to your son as their Lord and Savior in his name we pray.

Amen.

在今天的教导中，提姆·凯勒探讨了圣经关于罪的教导如何给我们一个深刻诚实但又极其充满希望的世界观。

天父，我想要恭喜你们把《奇异恩典》唱得这么好。你们从来没有诗班，也没有小号，但你们唱得很好。我认为这是因为经过这些年，你知道你是基督徒、并且已经是基督徒一段时间的方式之一，就是当你唱那首歌的时候，你的整个人生会在眼前闪过。你知道，这部关于你整个人生的不可思议的影片——A&E传记风格的，但主角是你——正在你眼前播放。我对你们中的很多人有所了解，也了解你们的人生故事，当我看着你们唱歌的时候，我知道这件事也正在你们身上发生。这是一个教会活出其名声的好标志，当人们把这首歌唱得这么好的时候。

让我们来看这段我们要集中思想的经文。我们要看马太福音19章16到25节，它印在你的公告单上。我们要读这段经文，并以此为基础来教导。马太福音19章16到25节。

有一个人来到耶稣面前问道："老师，我该做什么善事才能得到永生？"耶稣回答说："你为什么问我什么是善的？只有一位是善的。如果你想进入永生，就遵守诫命。"那人问："哪些诫命？"

耶稣回答说："不可杀人，不可奸淫，不可偷盗，不可作假见证，当孝敬父母，要爱邻舍如同自己。"年轻人说："这一切我都遵守了，我还缺少什么呢？"耶稣回答说："如果你想要完全，就去变卖你所有的，分给穷人，你就必有财宝在天上，然后来跟从我。"年轻人听到这话，就忧忧愁愁地走了，因为他有很多财产。耶稣对门徒说："我实在告诉你们，财主进天国是难的。"

"我又告诉你们，骆驼穿过针眼比财主进神的国还容易。"门徒听见这话就很惊讶，问道："这样谁能得救呢？"这是神的话。

这是著名的财主少年官的故事，富有的年轻人。他在两方面都很富有。他既有巨大的道德财富，也有巨大的经济财富，你注意到了吗？

首先，他有巨大的道德财富，他是一个非常正派的人，一个以道德卓越为特征的人。所以当耶稣实际列举了许多十诫——不可杀人，不可奸淫，不可偷盗，不可作假见证，当孝敬父母，爱邻舍如同自己——他说："对。我都做到了。"让我们假设他确实是在说真话，任何认识他的人都会说："是的，这是一个以道德卓越为特征的人。"

这是一个以性纯洁为特征的人，他是一个孝顺的儿子，他是一个好公民，他是一个诚实正直的人。让我们假设这是真的。不仅如此，我们被告知他很富有，他拥有很多财产。在那时，就像现在一样，有一种无意识的，有时是有意识的感觉，认为这两件事是相关的——如果你行善，你就会过得好；如果你过得好，那是因为你行了善。

我记得《音乐之声》中的玛丽亚，主角玛丽亚，当她即将嫁给一个富人时。她意识到她要嫁给一个富人了。于是她唱了一首歌，她说："在我的青春或童年的某个时刻，记得吗？我一定做过什么好事。"我一定是个相当好的人，否则上帝不会这样奖励我。当然，这是约伯的朋友们唱的歌的反面——当约伯陷入贫穷和疾病时，他们基本上说的是："在你的青春或童年的某个时刻，你一定做过什么坏事。一定有什么问题。"

有一种感觉，很难描述，没有人愿意清楚地说出来——一种感觉是如果你过着良善的生活，那么上帝会通过给你一定程度的繁荣来奖励你。因此在某种意义上，你以道德卓越为特征，显然是上帝通过给你繁荣的生活来奖励。所以当他走近耶稣时，这里似乎是理想的人。任何宗教领袖，任何你能想象到的宗教领袖都会说："这就是我要找的那种人。这就是我想要的那种人。"他不仅是一个以道德卓越为特征的人，不仅是一个生活在各方面都井井有条的人，而且他甚至愿意承认他还缺少什么。

我的意思是，一个富人愿意来教会并说"我仍然缺少什么"，这太好了。他在各方面都井井有条，他什么都有了。但即使他这么有条理，他甚至承认"我还没有完全准备好。是的，我仍然缺少什么。"所以他来到耶稣面前，耶稣严厉地与他交谈，并打发他离开。按照现代标准，这里是一个每个人都会说的人——这是一个人能够达到的最好状态了。

他甚至愿意承认他有属灵的需要，他来问："看，这是一个完全合理的问题，我还缺少什么？我的生命中仍然缺少一些属灵的东西。我缺少什么？"耶稣给了他一个令人震惊的严厉回答，打发他离开，向他表明他完全在神的国度之外。当门徒们看到这一切时，他们非常惊讶，说："等一下，如果他都在外面，那世界上谁能在里面呢？"

但这是要教导我们，基督教与人类心智、自然人类心智所能想象或思考的任何东西都完全不同。令人震惊的是，我们大多数人将会在同样的处境中。即使是那些能够像他那样把生活整理好的人，让自己在道德上井然有序、自律、自制、经济上井然有序、事业上井然有序。在纽约有很多这样的人，他们仍然愿意承认"我需要一些东西"，但显然有可能拥有所有这些，甚至是谦卑地去问，甚至是谦卑地去寻求，却被耶稣打发走。为什么他会忧愁地离去？

经上说"忧愁"。这个词有点弱。我认为更好的翻译是"悲伤"。他忧忧愁愁地离去了。这就是旧译本的译法。

我们如何避免忧愁地离去？这个人已经走上了一条人生道路，看起来他已经做到了一切。他只差一样东西。他不确定那是什么。我的意思是，他已经把他的事业整理好了。他已经建好了上山的台阶，他几乎到达山顶了，当他到达山顶时，他意识到"你知道，我几乎成功了。如果再有一步台阶，我就能到达顶峰了。"所以他转向耶稣说："我只需要那最后一步。"耶稣告诉他，他走的是一条完全错误的道路，他离神的国很远。我们怎样才能避免被耶稣打发走时忧愁呢？

事实上，我知道，这是救赎主教会的一大特点，现在你们当中有几十人可能处于类似的情况。哦，也许没有那么富有，也许没有那么井井有条。但你来这里是在问："我还缺少什么？"有一种危险，你可能会被忧愁地打发走。他为什么会忧愁地被打发走？他为什么这样离去？我想说，除非我们理解我看到的这四个原因，否则我们可能有同样被打发走的危险。所以让我们来看看，有四个原因。每一个都比前一个更严重，四个他忧愁离去的原因。

第一个原因是，让我列出这些，每一个都更严重，因此每一个都需要多一点思考。第一个是，他忧愁地离去是因为他与真正的耶稣交谈。我在这一点上不会花太长时间，但我认为你需要说出来。他受到困扰的原因之一是因为他在与真正的耶稣交谈，他在听真正的耶稣的真正信息。当你与真正的耶稣交谈时，你总是会受到震惊。当你遇到他的真正信息时，你总是会受到困扰。

你总是会受到困扰。事实上，我会说得更远。这是你作为基督徒成长的方式。当你遇到福音的真正信息时，你总是会发现两件令人震惊的事情。它要求的比你想象的要多，它提供的比你想象的也要多。当你遇到真正的耶稣时，你会发现他从你那里要求的比你想象的要多得多，他给你提供的也比你梦想的要多得多。坦率地说，这就是成长的意义。你作为基督徒成长的方式，你知道你已经成长的方式，是无论你做基督徒多久了，一年前，你对这两件事要无知得多。今天，你看到了他要求的更多。他要求的比你想象的要多得多，但他提供的也比你想象的要多得多。这就是与真正的耶稣打交道的意义。

你看，每当你真正遇到真正的耶稣时，总是发生的是你看到了这一点，然后你只能有两种反应之一。你要么俯伏敬拜、惊奇，把自己交给他；要么你会被冒犯而离去。被冒犯地离去还有希望，因为你总可以思考一下，至少你已经看到了真相，你可能会回来。

但是不可能的是遇到了真正的耶稣而无动于衷。如果这里有任何人经历了某种形式的冷漠，换句话说，如果你觉得基督教是可笑的、无关紧要的、无聊的，或者如果你觉得基督教只是一种甜蜜的、安慰性的东西，偶尔沾染一下很好，或者如果你觉得基督教有点模糊地产生内疚感和焦虑感，你还没有见过真正的耶稣，因为你被冷漠所控制。每当你遇到真正的耶稣时，他会困扰你，这就是他受到困扰的第一个原因。

其次，他忧愁离去的第二个原因是耶稣粉碎了他关于宗教运作方式的两个基本假设。耶稣粉碎了他的宗教观念。现在，对我们非常有启发性的是，这个年轻人的宗教观念不仅在他那个时代很普遍，而且在今天也绝对普遍。你看，他来的时候知道他缺少一些东西。他需要某种属灵体验，至少是这样。他不确定他与神的关系。他说："我该做什么才能承受永生？"我不认为他的意思是他不知道他已经拥有永生。我认为他的意思是他不确定他是否拥有。他不确定他与神的关系，他内心深处缺乏某种平安。所以他来询问。

你看，他处理这件事的方式是基于两个假设。他寻求这种平安的方式，可能看起来很诚实。当你第一次看的时候，它似乎非常真诚，但事实是他接近神是基于两个假设，而耶稣完全粉碎了这两个假设。这两个假设是：基督教是你可以添加的东西，基督教是你可以做到的事情。基督教是你可以添加的东西，你可以做到的事情。

首先，人们假设他假设基督教是你可以添加到你生活中的东西，一种装饰你生活、充实你生活的方式。就像你在听。假设你是一个指挥，你在听音乐，你说："有一个音符没有出来，你看，有一行，我听不到。"很多人说："那就是我需要的。我已经有了相当好的生活。我需要让自己更完善。我需要添加一些东西。"所以他说："我还缺少什么？"他去找耶稣说："我能添加什么？"但耶稣的回应，正如我们稍后将看到的，是提出一个令人震惊的要求。

耶稣真正在做的是说，基督教不是你添加的东西。基督教更像是一场爆炸，摧毁你所拥有的一切，为新事物开路。基督教不是你添加的东西。基督教是完全重新开始。记得尼哥底母吗？他也是一个人，他不是一个富有的年轻人。他是一个富有的老年人。他在夜间来见耶稣，约翰福音第三章，他基本上说了同样的话。他说："你是一位好老师。我是以色列的官长。但我只是觉得我缺少一些东西。我还缺少什么？"耶稣说：轰！你必须重生。你必须完全重造。一切都必须被打碎。

年轻人，他是在说，你不需要再爬一级台阶就能到达山顶。我所拥有的，会彻底改变一切。我所拥有的，会粉碎穿越这座山，这是一种全新的方法。所以耶稣在说的是，基督教绝对不是你添加的东西。它是完全革命性的。

然后，另一个假设，你不能只是把耶稣基督作为一个附加品带进来。他不只是装饰你。他不是你书架上的另一本书。好吧。他不是你硬盘上的另一个文件，你知道，只是以某种方式给你更多的能力。你知道，他不是，他不是你添加的东西，然后说："哇，看看我的程序现在有多强大。"哦不。哦不。他是一个全新的程序。他不只是添加并启动你的程序。

然后年轻人做的第二件事是他认为基督教是你做的事情。他说："我该做什么善事？"耶稣再次非常直接。他说："只有一位是善的。"过一会儿，我们会看到，他还要求这个人做一些完全不可能的事情。换句话说，耶稣基督说，我要你知道，到达神那里不是靠良善的问题。没有人能够足够好，没有人能够足够道德。

然后看看这个猛烈的逻辑。他说："把你所有的财富，哦，富人，都卖掉，把所有的都给穷人，然后来跟从我。"他在做什么？这是绝妙的。他说："哦，你遵守了所有十诫，是吗？好吧，让我们从第一条开始。让我们看第一条。第一条是，你看，要尽心、尽性、尽力、尽意爱神，在我面前不可有别的神。"好吧。他说："让我们试试这一条。我要你把你所有的钱都卖掉，只是因为我耶稣基督，主，这样说。你感觉如何？"他说，你看，如果神真的是你生命中的第一位，其他一切都是微不足道的。

与神相比，其他一切都是小玩意，是小饰品。没有什么比得上他的事业，没有什么比得上他的心，什么都没有。你是否有别的神在我面前呢？在他面前？你的心是如何运作的？你看，他在做什么？他在说，我亲爱的朋友，没有人能够尽心、尽性、尽力、尽意爱神。没有人爱邻舍如同自己。你不明白吗？你的问题，哦，富有的年轻人，不是你需要多一点良善。你的问题是你不愿承认你内心深处知道的——你并不善良。

我几乎能听到耶稣这样说。他在说，你来找我的原因是因为你在某种程度上知道你并不善良。拿一根针，只是拿一根缝衣针，用肉眼看它，它看起来完美无瑕，干净、纯洁、明亮，但在显微镜下看它，它满是坑洞和变形。任何走近一颗心的人都会看到同样的事情。当我是一个年轻的牧师时，很多年前，我犯了一个可怕的错误。我经常主持葬礼，很多时候我为优秀的基督徒男女主持葬礼。据我所知，你知道，从我能看到他们的地方，用肉眼看，他们看起来完美无瑕，他们是神的好男女。所以我会做这些充满赞美的葬礼讲道，讲述这个人是多么伟大，他的自制力、爱心、能力和智慧，我会看到家人在座位上扭动不安。

因为如果你足够靠近任何一颗心，任何人类的心，它都是变形的，都是有坑洞的。而这个富有的年轻人知道这一点，他不愿意向自己承认，耶稣试图突破。没有人是善的。你认为基督教是你添加的东西，不，它是一场革命。你认为基督教是你做的事情，不，它是你接受的东西。无论我们在哪里看，我们都能看到破碎、战争、残酷和心碎。我们在周围的世界和自己的生活中感受到它。它是怎么变成这样的，我们能做什么？在这个月发行的全新书籍《这个世界出了什么问题》中，提姆·凯勒提供了一个清晰而富有同情心的答案。

这本书取材于救赎主教会的一系列教导，凯勒博士展示了罪的现实如何解释我们周围看到的痛苦，以及只有福音才能提供持久的自由和医治。无论你是被我们世界的状态所压倒，还是在与自己的错误或选择作斗争，或在寻找希望和喜乐，《这个世界出了什么问题》将帮助你看到福音如何对我们世界的心碎和我们每个人内心的痛苦说话。这本新书《这个世界出了什么问题》是我们对你这个月帮助福音与生活分享耶稣好消息的捐赠的感谢。今天就在 gospelandlife.com/give 领取你的副本。那是 gospelandlife.com/give。

所以我们必须继续了，但让我这样对你说。世界上每一种其他宗教，世界上每一种其他哲学，甚至所谓的常识，都这样划分全人类。看到了吗？上面是好人，下面是坏人，嗯？上面是道德的，下面是不道德的，嗯？上面是好人，下面是坏人。有宗教的，也许下面是无宗教的，这要取决于一点，但基本上每个人都认为那就是界线。耶稣来了，说，不，真正的界线不是一条水平线，真正的界线是一条垂直线。他说，我要你知道，实际上有两条通向神的道路。

好人和坏人都可以凭自己的努力来做，或者好人和坏人，不管你做过什么，不管你是谁，不管多么伟大，不管多么糟糕，都可以在一个完全不同的基础上来。你可以不是在你自己努力的基础上来，而是在我努力的基础上来。直到你看到穿过人类中心的真正界线不是水平的，而是垂直的，你才能理解。垂直线是真正的。它穿过水平线，把水平线切成碎片，在两边都是如此，因为不管你在这边有多好，耶稣说，你并不好。只是相对的。你只是少了一点坑洞和变形。不管你在这边有多坏，正如我们一会儿将看到的，你也可以来。换句话说，这个年轻人相对于其他人来说是好的，他相对于其他人来说是非常好的，但他对良善的教义是错误的。结果，他忧愁地离去了。耶稣粉碎了他的假设。这些假设几乎每个人都有。

第三，他忧愁离去的原因是因为他在与真正的耶稣交谈。其次，因为耶稣粉碎了他的宗教假设。第三，他忧愁离去是因为耶稣变得个人化了。我想对你说，尽管耶稣与他的观点相矛盾，但那不是他如此悲伤的真正原因。不。耶稣拒绝保持学术化。这个年轻人就像很多人一样。我看到这种情况很多年了。他基本上相信他的问题是一个学术问题。他说："我缺少一些东西。我不知道为什么，我感觉，我不知道为什么，我感觉好像有什么不对。我缺少一些东西。是我错过或不理解的教义吗？是我应该做而不知道的项目吗？还是我在违反某条不知道的规则？是什么？"

他基本上是在说，我在思考中缺少一些东西，他以学术的方式来处理，而耶稣不会这样做。我看到这种情况很多年了。人们说："我对基督教的真正问题是，我不明白一个爱的神怎么能惩罚人。"或者你说："我对基督教的真正问题是，我只是不喜欢它这么排他，它似乎排斥其他宗教。那是我的问题。"或者你可能说："我真正的问题是整个奇迹的概念。我只是不能相信，作为一个相信奇迹的现代人。"或者你可能说，好吧，你甚至可以变得不那么学术化，你说："我真正的问题是我有一个坏习惯，我无法戒掉，或者我有一个问题，我似乎无法处理。或者我陷入了某些事情，我不知道我是否真的想放弃，或者我不知道如何摆脱它。"

所以你变得不那么学术化了，但耶稣基督，看，这个富有的年轻人就是这样的，但他来到了耶稣基督面前，他有穿透所有烟幕、所有伪装、所有掩饰、所有姿态的眼睛。你知道，在马可福音中，这同一个故事被讲述了，马可插入了这个故事中非常重要的东西，你看，你知道他说"我还缺什么"的那个地方吗？在马可福音中，他说："我还缺什么？"马可说，耶稣看着他，爱他，说："把你所有的都卖掉。"他看着他，爱他。这是什么意思？

这意味着他不只是在看他的脸。这意味着他在读他的灵魂，就像读一本书一样。这意味着他说，我知道这会伤害你，但我要你知道，我看到了真正的癌症，我看到了真正的问题，我看到了真正在杀害你的东西。你必须放弃所有的钱。现在，理解耶稣在做什么的唯一方法是把它放在上下文中。据我所知，圣经中没有其他人被要求像那样放弃一切。甚至撒该也只被要求放弃一半。换句话说，没有规定说所有基督徒要跟随基督就必须放弃一切，所有的钱。没有任何地方说你必须卖掉所有的钱，进入完全的贫穷。没有任何地方这样说。

所以这意味着他对这个年轻人的方式是一种激烈的措施，就像你对待酗酒者或赌徒的方式一样。耶稣在说的是，我们的困难，在所有反对和抱怨的背后，我们真正拥有的困难从来不是我们最初认为的困难。我认识的每一个在基督徒生活中走得很远的人都发现了这一点，我们一开始认为的问题实际上并不是问题。耶稣基督一直走进来说，在所有这些背后，有一场你与神关于你的梦想的权力斗争。旋转木马。

音乐剧。有一个地方，其中一个角色，凯丽·派普里奇，唱了一首关于她多么迫不及待想结婚生子的歌。那是她的伟大梦想。你知道，她唱了一首罗杰斯和汉默斯坦最抒情的歌曲之一。她唱道："当孩子们睡着后，我们将坐着做梦。"但她唱那首歌的那晚，如果耶稣基督降临到旋转木马中间，他会走到凯丽·派普里奇身边说："你还缺一件事。我要你愿意为我过一辈子单身生活。"这就是他会做的。他来到亚伯拉罕面前说："我要你把你的儿子，你的独生子，你所爱的，献上作为燔祭。"他来到富有的年轻人面前说："你必须放弃所有的钱。"

他在做什么？耶稣基督在说，我要你的梦想。有一首歌我们在晚间崇拜时唱，开头是"圣父"。你知道那首歌吗？你们中的一些人知道。有些人来过。这首歌很短，但主要部分是我们必须交出所有的梦想。耶稣基督说的是，我要你生命中最重要的东西。那是流血的伤口。那是癌症。我要你的梦想。我要那个你通过它梦想没有神就能拥有权力和喜乐生活的东西。我要那个你认为会给你没有神的权力和喜乐生活的东西。除非你把它给了我，不仅我们的关系不会正确，而且你不知道，它正在杀害你。

几年前，《村声》杂志在一月底发表了一篇文章，引起了很多关注。原因是这篇文章是关于大城市里不安全的性行为再次上升的事实。写这篇文章的作者是一个开始重新从事不安全性行为的人。在某一点上，作者说了这句话。作者说："起初，我对自己做的事情感到震惊。"引用他的话："我对自己做的事情感到如此厌恶，以至于这似乎根本不是我的选择。就像一个怪物做的。"我对自己做的事情感到如此厌恶，以至于这似乎根本不是我的选择。就像一个怪物做的。

但当你读完这篇文章时，在结尾，反思继续，这是它的结尾。"是的，如果你想活着，你必须避免疯狂的、匿名的、自发的、爆炸性的性行为。然后你必须问，你是谁？生活是关于什么的？"现在听着，因为我不是挑性作为最大的邪恶，就像耶稣不是挑钱作为最大的邪恶一样。我不是用这个例子因为我是保守派，耶稣也不是用他的例子因为他是自由派。关键是，任何你决定会给你没有神的喜乐和权力生活的东西都会变成一个怪物。它确实会驱使你。它会把你带走。

耶稣看着这个说："这是你的怪物。"耶稣说，任何东西，当他爱他的时候说这话的原因，他说："我必须告诉你这个。我知道这会伤害你，但我爱你。我告诉你的原因是，这是你认为你可以没有神就能拥有权力和喜乐生活的方式。结果，我们必须杀死这个东西，在它杀死你之前。你生活失控的原因是因为你害怕把控制权交给神。"他说，把它给我，让我决定你会有多少钱。把我放在第一位。愿意与任何东西分离，任何东西，改变你对这件事的态度。愿意与任何东西分离，任何东西，所以他对这个人说，愿意放弃这一切。让我决定你会有多富有。他对凯丽·派普里奇说，愿意一辈子不结婚。让我来决定。他对亚伯拉罕说，愿意没有任何孩子。

我们认为问题是学术的。我们认为问题是表面的。我们认为问题是行为上的，但核心有一个怪物。耶稣说，交出你的梦想。钱可以成为一个怪物。钱在属灵上是如此危险，以至于即使没有它也可以毁掉你，因为你的嫉妒和欲望，你可以为了得到它而自我毁灭。但关键是，不是钱或性或工作本身。而是钱或性，它们比耶稣更重要。这就是耶稣的意思。是钱或性或工作作为你最珍贵的梦想，作为你最深的梦想。

耶稣，我要它。你知道钱如何做到这一点吗？我见过没有钱的人。但如果钱是他们梦想没有神就能完全控制生活的方式，我们会用钱，因为我们觉得它会给我们权力的生活。我们会掌控我们的生活。我们终于会感到掌控了。人们不会欺负我们。如果你没有钱，钱这个怪物会让你充满焦虑。它会让你对比你拥有更多的人充满苦毒。它会让你充满嫉妒。它会让你总是担心钱。它会让你工作过度。它会让你践踏人。

令人惊讶的是，新的脱口秀节目如何把人们推向冲突。人们会看那些让人尴尬和争吵的脱口秀节目。最近有人在一个脱口秀节目后开枪打死了一个人，报纸媒体打电话给所有脱口秀节目说："你们为什么还在这样做？"他们说因为人们在看，这意味着人们在买，这意味着，是的，这很糟糕，但它给我们带来了钱。它变成了一个怪物。是的，我们在践踏人，但它给我们带来了钱。你知道最糟糕的事情是什么吗？当你真正变得富有时。当你变得富有时，你会觉得那是因为你聪明，因为你精明，你对自己的直觉非常有信心，你对自己的信念非常有信心。它变成了一个怪物。任何东西都会。

耶稣说，是的，你缺一件事。那是什么？这是结尾。第四个原因，看，他确实缺一件事，不是放弃钱的事。是天上的财宝。这个年轻人错过这一切的原因是因为他不理解天上的财宝。耶稣基督来说，你必须除掉你的怪物。你必须把我放在第一位，那是你获得天上财宝的唯一方式。哦，天上的财宝是什么？它意味着这两件事，我必须在这里非常简短。

第一，它意味着看到他是你在天上的财宝。耶稣真正在说的是，我要你放弃一切。他的意思是，我要你看到，如果你只有我，你就是富有的。不仅对人富有，对神也富有。他说，年轻人，我知道你在这个地区有最大的产业，但与我的赦免相比，那不算什么。与我的义相比，那不算什么。与被收养进天父的家庭相比，那不算什么。与我能给你的相比，那不算什么。你不明白吗？贼可以偷走它，虫子和锈可以腐蚀它，但我给你的是永久的。

如果你不明白只有我是善的，但作为你的救主，如果你依靠我在神面前站立，你在我里面就变得善良。你会看到我是你的财宝，我是你的义，我是你在神面前的记录。如果你拥有那个，那么它就会改变你对一切的态度，钱不再是神圣的了。与天上的财宝相比，它什么都不是。你从忧虑中解脱，你从嫉妒中解脱，你有了慷慨的自由。

但那不是全部。最后一件事是，如果你想理解天上的财宝，你必须看到他是你在天上的财宝，但最后，你必须理解你是他在天上的财宝。耶稣说，当他派他的门徒出去时，他们回来说他们赶出了鬼魔。他们说："这太棒了。我们在行神迹。"他说："不要因为鬼服从你们就欢喜，而要因你们的名字写在天上而欢喜。"哦，他们的名字写在天上的哪里？

圣经在旧约中告诉我们，大祭司进到神面前时，每一个以色列人的名字都刻在宝石上，戴在他心口上，当他进到神面前时。耶稣是我们的大祭司。在以赛亚书49章，神对以色列说："妇人焉能忘记她吃奶的婴孩？她可能会忘记，但我不会忘记你，看，我已经把你铭刻在我的手掌上。"如果你在这里放一个纹身，你不会总是看到它。如果你在这里放一个纹身，你不会总是看到它，如果你在这里放一个纹身，你显然不会，但如果你在这里放一个纹身，神在说什么？他在说，如果你让我的儿子成为你的财宝，那就使你成为我的财宝。

现在当我看着你，我看到一种绝对的美丽，我看到你在基督里发光，我看到你在基督里是义的，我宠爱你，我凝视你。那是你可能拥有的最令人振奋的想法吗？如果你活在这种神圣的意识中，或者你从你的银行账户或你的裙子尺寸来获得你的身份？你不明白随之而来的自由吗？耶稣说，只有当你明白只有我和我在一起，你才是富有的，你才会真正自由。正如约翰·牛顿曾经说的："自从我认识了救主的名字，以及他为我所承受的一切，我不再为空洞的名声劳苦，我不再渴望金子，他的手把我安置在这个隐退之处，我以他的爱为主题，看到这世界所称为伟大的一切，不过是一场醒着的梦。"

如果你来到他面前，即使他让你悲伤，你会看到他真的爱你。让我们祷告。我们的父，我们祈求你教导我们不仅如何从贪婪中得自由，而且如何完全得自由，通过看到你的儿子向我们要求的一切。我们看着你说，哦，主耶稣基督，我们以为你是一位伟大的老师，我们以为你是一位伟大的道德家，我们期待得到一点额外的帮助，我们看到你必须成为我们的中保，我们的先知、祭司、君王，我们的阿尔法、我们的俄梅戛，我们的一切，我们祈求你让这成为现实，这样我们就会找到只有那些完全彻底地把你的儿子作为他们的主和救主来顺服的人才能得到的自由，奉他的名我们祷告。

阿门。
