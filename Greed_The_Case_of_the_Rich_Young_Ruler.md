### Introduction: The Fundamental Problem

Some people say the fundamental problem of the world is poverty. Others say it's bad systems, poor education, or biology, but what if none of these can fully explain the brokenness we see, both in the headlines and in our own hearts? In today's teaching, Tim Keller looks at how the Bible's teaching on sin gives us a deeply honest and yet incredibly hopeful view of the world.

### The Rich Young Ruler

Now a man came up to Jesus and asked, teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life? Why do you ask me about what is good Jesus replied, there is only one who is good. If you want to enter life, obey the commandments, which ones the man inquired? Jesus replied, do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as yourself. All these I have kept, the young man said, what do I still lack? Jesus answered, if you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven, then come follow me. When the young man heard this, he went away sad because he had great wealth.

> "It's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."

**This is God's word.**

### Four Reasons for Grieving

#### 1. Meeting the Real Jesus

One of the reasons why he was disturbed, it was because he was talking to the real Jesus and he was hearing the real message of Jesus. When you talk to the real Jesus, you are always shocked.

#### 2. Smashed Assumptions

Jesus smashed two of his basic assumptions about how religion works. The assumptions are that Christianity is something you can add and Christianity is something you can do.

#### 3. Jesus Got Personal

Jesus refused to stay academic. He looked at him and loved him and said, sell everything you've got.

#### 4. Treasure in Heaven

The fourth reason, see, he does lack one thing, it's not the giving away of the money. It's treasure in heaven.

### Treasure in Heaven

Jesus is really saying is, I want you to see that if you have me and only me, you're rich. And not just rich toward people, rich toward God.

> "If you make my son your treasure, that makes you my treasure."

**Let's pray.**

### 引言：根本问题

有些人说，世界的根本问题是贫穷。其他人说是糟糕的制度、教育不良或生物学，但如果这些都不能完全解释我们在头条新闻和自己内心中看到的破碎呢？在今天的教导中，Tim Keller 看圣经对罪的教导如何给我们一个深刻诚实但又极其充满希望的世界观。

### 富有的年轻统治者

现在有一个人来到耶稣面前问道，老师，我该做什么好事才能得到永生？耶稣回答说，你为什么问我什么是好的？只有一位是好的。如果你想进入生命，就遵守诫命。那人问，哪些诫命？耶稣回答说，不可杀人，不可奸淫，不可偷盗，不可作假见证，当孝敬父母，并爱人如己。年轻人说，这一切我都遵守了，我还缺少什么呢？耶稣回答说，如果你想要完美，就去变卖你所有的，分给穷人，你将有财宝在天上，然后来跟从我。年轻人听到这话，就忧忧愁愁地走了，因为他有很多财产。

> “骆驼穿过针眼比财主进神的国还容易。”

**这是上帝的话。**

### 四个悲伤的原因

#### 1. 遇见真实的耶稣

他感到不安的原因之一是因为他在与真实的耶稣交谈，并听到了耶稣的真实信息。当你与真实的耶稣交谈时，你总是会感到震惊。

#### 2. 被打破的假设

耶稣打破了他关于宗教运作的两个基本假设。假设是基督教是你可以添加的东西和基督教是你可以做的事情。

#### 3. 耶稣变得个人化

耶稣拒绝保持学术化。他看着他，爱他，并说，变卖你所有的。

#### 4. 天上的财宝

第四个原因，他确实缺少一件事，不是变卖财产，而是天上的财宝。

### 天上的财宝

耶稣真正想说的是，我希望你看到，如果你只有我，你就是富有的。不仅对人富有，对神也富有。

> “如果你把我的儿子当作你的财宝，那就使你成为我的财宝。”

**让我们祷告。**
