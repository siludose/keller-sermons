## English Transcript / 英文原文

Today, Tim Keller explores how lasting change actually happens in the life of a Christian  and why the Gospel offers a radically different process of transformation than anything  else. Tonight's scripture reading is found in Romans chapter 8, verse 28, and then verses  38 and 39. And we know that for those who love God, all things work together for good, for those  who are called according to His purpose. Where I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither  the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything  else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ  Jesus our Lord. This is God's Word.

We've been looking for a few weeks at Romans 6, 7, and 8, and we said that this is especially  about how Jesus concretely changes your life when He comes into it. And what I wanted to do was just one last time, I wanted to look at this ending of Romans  chapter 8. It's a magnificent ending, and yet its point is very simple. In these last several verses, in these last several verses Paul says, here's the thing  I'm giving you that will absolutely change your life through Christ. And the thing that He's giving us is an assurance.

He says, this is the thing you can get out every day and use. This is the thing that will change your life. But as He expresses the assurance, for us in our modern Western culture, a question comes  up. So it's very hard for us in our modern Western culture just to receive this thing and to enjoy  it and to use it unimpeded. So what we're going to do tonight is look at this assurance, actually first let me read  it to you.

Let me read you the whole last 12 verses. Listen to what He's saying. It's really saying one thing. I read it in a slightly different translation. And we know that all things are working together for good, for those who love God and who  are called according to His purpose.

For those who for new, He predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son. And those He predestined, He called. And those He called, He justified. And those He justified, He glorified. What then shall we say to these things?

If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up for us all. How will He not also together with Him freely give us all things? Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies who is to condemn.

It is Christ who died. More than that was raised than is ever at the right hand of God interceding for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? No.

In all things, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through Him who loved  us. We are absolutely certain that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor  powers nor things present nor anything to come nor height nor depth nor anything  in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus  our Lord. There's an assurance there and I'd like to look at them to three headings. That we can be assured, why we can be assured and how we can be assured, how we can make  this assurance, not just an abstraction, but an operative thing in our lives. That we can be assured, why we can be assured and how we can be assured.

First, briefly, that we can be assured, what is His point? Here's His point, there's a joy to be had. There's a joy to be had that if you have it, we'll enable you to face anything in life  without sinking or crumbling. And this joy is a certitude, it's a certainty, an absolute certainty that God doesn't just  love you now, it's a certainty that He does love you now in Christ, but He always will. And nothing can shake that and nothing can separate you from that, no matter what.

The Lord of the universe loves you not just now, but always will. That's the assurance. And this assurance is two forks. Because once you've connected with God through Jesus Christ, this assurance is two forks. The first is, well, I'll tell you what the two forks are right off, it means that God loves  you no matter what bad stuff is happening inside you, and no matter how much bad stuff is  happening outside you, no matter how bad the stuff is happening inside you, no matter  how bad the stuff is that's happening outside you, you can be sure He still loves you.

See, first of all, no matter how bad stuff is going on inside you, sometimes we do some  awful stuff. I want you to know that there is stuff in your heart that you don't know about yet. And then when it pops up, you're going to say, I can't believe I'm capable of that. And you're going to be so dissolution with yourself and you're going to be so mad  yourself. And when those times happen, what do you say?

You say, I can't believe that God could love me after I've done that. And yet here's what Paul says, he says, who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies who is to condemn. It is Christ Jesus who died. More than that was raised and is ever at the right hand of God, interceding for us.

Not one thing that you can possibly do today can bring you back into condemnation. It's all covered. It's all paid for, see. God loves you no matter how much bad stuff happens inside you. But secondly, we're told, the other fork of the assurance, is that God loves you no matter  how much bad stuff is happening outside you.

You see this list, tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, danger, sword. See, when bad stuff happens, when everything is going wrong, you feel like God doesn't  love me or he wouldn't let all this stuff happen. See, really bad stuff happens inside. You say, oh, look at what a mess I am, God couldn't love me. But when really bad stuff happens outside, you say, look what a mess life is.

Obviously, God has abandoned me. There can't be a loving God, and yet Paul says, oh, yes, there can be. No matter how bad the mess is on the outside, you still can be assured, he says that God  loves you, because he says in verse 28, what? He says, all things are working together for good to those that love God. Now what does that mean?

Taken together as a whole, look at from the long term. Every single thing that happens, every single thing God is working together into a plan  for our good and for His glory. That's what it says. And my favorite biblical example of that are two incidents that happen in a place called  Dothan. In Genesis, the first thing that happens at Dothan is that Joseph is thrown into a pit  by his brothers, and he's going to be sold into slavery.

So he's got a life of absolute misery ahead of him, and he prays to God, oh, God, get me  out of this. Don't let me be sold into slavery. And guess what, silence, silence. And he is sold into slavery, and he has a horrible miserable life for years and years and  years and years. And then many centuries later, the second thing that happens in Dothan, Elisha is in  Dothan.

Now it's a city, and it's besieged by an enemy, and he's afraid that they're going to be  overrun and destroyed. And Elisha cries out the God and says, oh, Lord, please save us. Please save us from this peril. And this time, God sends chariots of fire and wipes out the invading army and everybody  saved. But if you know the story of Joseph, you know that if he hadn't been sold into slavery,  and if he hadn't gone through all those years of misery, not only would have hundreds  of thousands of people died of famine, but his own family would have been destroyed  by their own sin.

And what that means, if you know the story, you know how it works out, and what that  means is that God was just as actively working everything together for good in Joseph's  life as in Elisha's life. He was just as actively working in the seeming slowness and non-answer to Joseph as he  was in the swift, noisy answer to Elisha. And so Paul says, that's always the case. And so no matter how much bad stuff's happening inside you, no matter how much bad stuff's  happening outside you, you can be assured God absolutely and fallibly, unchangeably loves  you. And then when he gets to the very end, he has a sweeping statement in verse 38 and 39,  which is printed out there.

And at this point, Paul says, I am absolutely certain. He uses the word that means absolute intent, certainty and persuasion. And then he just bursts. He pushes. He stretches out to the limits of language to try to say neither death nor life nor angels  nor principalities, nor heaven, nor hell nor height nor death, nothing.

Nothing can separate you for the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord, nothing. Nothing can dislodge you from his love and nothing can dislodge his love from you. And there are people who have looked at this passage and said, oh, well, yes, but nothing  can separate you from God, but you could separate yourself. Because if you start out to follow Jesus and you turn back, you can lose your salvation,  you can lose his love. So maybe nothing can separate you from God's love, but you can separate yourself.

And that is not right. That is not the right way to read that text. And I'll tell you why. Look, what does it say? If you could turn back, if you could separate yourself from the love of God, aren't you  part of creation?

He says, nothing at all of creation can separate you from the love of God. Aren't you part of creation? Last, by my look, you were. What Paul is trying to say is every possible situation that might turn you away from God,  every possible situation that might turn you away from God, persecution, torture. None of those things will.

Because love is so powerful, they will keep you facing him, keep you loving him, keep  you in his arms no matter what. So see, here's your assurance, no matter how much all the powers of evil inside you and  all the powers of evil outside you cannot separate you from the love of God, can't dislodge  you from it, can't dislodge love of God from you. Once you give yourself to God through Christ, He is yours, you are His, nothing ever, ever  can change that, that's the assurance. Now we could, it would be great if we could just move on and say, so now how does that work  in your life what we can't? Because as I said, in our Western culture, this sort of, this promise immediately raises  an issue.

Now the reason I say Western culture is pretty important, because we have an objection that  really bothers us, all this talk about predestination, right? And calling an election, God working everything out according to His plan, now this bothers  us, but don't forget who us is, it's us, there's other centuries and there's other cultures  that this doesn't bother, this is a problem for a modern Western enlightenment drenched,  individualistic people. And it's always good to remember that, this great objection we have, we must not absolutize  any of our objections, they always arise out of our culture and we should take it seriously  because here's where we live. But it's not, you know, we're not the only culture in the world and we shouldn't therefore  say this is an insuperable obstacle to faith in Christ. However, here's the thing that modern Western people say, when they hear that Jesus Christ  will keep you in His love so that no matter what we do, we'll never stop loving Him and  He'll never stop loving us.

And He's totally in control of everything so everything is working out according to His  plan. The first thing that comes to our mind is, well, hey, what about free will then? See, that's our problem. What about human responsibility? Because it sounds like God is doing all this stuff despite our choices, that everything  is going to happen, is going to happen in spite of our choices.

And if that's the case, well, then who cares how you live? Who cares what you do? It's all going to happen, see? You know, I'm a Christian so now, you know, it doesn't really matter. I don't have to do anything because He's going to keep me loving Him and everything's  working out according to His plan.

Well, then it doesn't really matter. So what happens to free will and what happens to personal responsibility? That's a good question. And in modern, when I said this is a Western issue in particular, we're reminded of that  this last week in the Science Times, New York Times. On Tuesday, there was a big article, and the name of it was the power of free will.

Now you have it, now you don't. And it was a kind of survey of the current debate right now about whether we have free will  or not. And the consensus of most of the scientists and the people in the article was we don't. Now it's intriguing for a person of my age is it's interesting that the last, you know,  now the real question is, do we have free will or are we determined by our evolutionary  biology? That's the issue now.

See, the argument is that natural selection is what determines everything about us. So we think we're choosing to love someone or fall in love with someone. We think we're choosing that, but actually we're hardwired to do that to pass on our  genetic material, so we don't really have free will. And so that's the debate. Do we have free will or not, or are we hardwired by our biology?

It's funny, because 30 years ago when I was in college, the argument was a psychological  one, not a biological one. The argument was a Freudian one, as it were, and that is, do we have free will or are  we completely controlled by our unconscious urges or our past or things like that? But the thing you always see in all these debates in the West is it's either or, either  or, either we free have free will or everything is determined or put it this way. We believe either we have free will and we're responsible for our choices and our choices  matter, and that means the future is open and undetermined either we have free will  and the future is open undetermined or something has set and fixed the future and then our  choices don't matter. See, it's either or, but in the Bible, it's never either or, never.

From the beginning to the end, in principle and in practice, it's always this, you are  free and you are responsible and your choices matter and you're responsible for your choices  and no one's forcing you to make those choices and yet, every single thing that happens  as a result of those choices is worked out, is working out exactly according to the plan  of God. And it's not just that God foresees what you're going to do, but rather what you do fits  in with the plan that He wants and the course that He wants history to take. There's so many examples I could give you, I'll just start with, I'll give you two. First of all, principle, listen to these proverbs, this is from Proverbs 16, verse 1. To man belongs the plans of the heart, but from the Lord comes the reply of the tongue.

And verse 9, the heart of man plans his way, but it is the Lord who establishes his steps. Hear that? To you belong the plans of your heart, but what you do as a result of the plan comes from God. To you belongs your plans, but when you actually speak or act, that always fits in with God's  plan, always. Now, that's astounding.

See, on the one hand it says, your plans, your choices belong to you. They're yours. They're not coerced. God is not doing it for you and you can't say I couldn't help it. They're yours.

You are free. You are responsible. The result is always exactly what God wants. You say, how can that be? Well, that's because you're a Westerner and it's always either or, why does it have to  be either or?

Can't God? Isn't it possible? The God could actually fix things and work things out and at the same time not violate  your free will? Why couldn't God do that? I can't imagine how I could do it.

No. Of course you can't, but you're under qualify for this job of God. Jack Packer puts it fascinatingly in his book, Evangelism and the Sovereignty of God. He says the relationship of our free will and responsibility and God's sovereignty and  control of all things is an antinomy. An antinomy, he defines, is not a contradiction but an apparent contradiction.

And the example he uses is light. We know that light sometimes acts and behaves as waves and sometimes as particles. Because it acts as if it does not have, it does not consist of matter and sometimes it  acts as if it does. Now we don't know how that could be. It shouldn't be, but it is.

We don't know how that works, but we know it does work that way. And so we work with it, otherwise you're not going to know how to handle light. And Jack Packer says, see, it's obviously not a real contradiction, it's just an apparent  contradiction. We don't have the knowledge to figure it out, it's the same thing here. And if you want to see that we are absolutely, on the one hand, God is setting and fixing  absolutely everything the way he wants it to be, but he doesn't do that despite our choices.

But through them, our choices are part of his plan. And you say, oh, so he just knows what we're going to choose. Yeah, but it's more than that. See, there you go. You want to do the either or thing.

No, it's both in. Both in. In Acts chapter 27, this is my favorite example in the Bible of this, Paul is on a boat with  sailors and soldiers in a terrible storm, terrible storm. And in the midst of the storm when everybody's scared, the sailors and soldiers are really  afraid that they're going to die, God sends an angel to Paul and says, the ship will  be wrecked, but not one life will be lost. So Paul comes out on the deck and says, God has spoken to me.

And he has said that even though the ship will be wrecked, not one life will be lost. And now, Paul believed that, you know why? In the Old Testament, if you're a prophet and you make a prophecy, and that prophecy doesn't  come true, the prophets put to death, you know why? Because the Word of God is always sure. And if he actually gave you the Word of God, then it has to come true.

So Paul was absolutely sure that it was God's plan and it was absolutely certain that no  life would be lost. But in verse 31 of Acts 27, it turns out that the sailors decide they were going to,  you know, the storm is continuing on and the sailors decide they were going to sneak  off the boat. So they start to get into the life boat. And when Paul sees the sailors, trying to get off the boat, he tells the soldiers to stop  them and he says, if they leave the boat, we're all going to die. Now I believe this is the beginning of the great army navy rivalry, actually.

But beyond that, this doesn't make sense to us, doesn't it? Wait a minute, we would say to Paul, look, if you really believe that no one's life is  going to be lost, if that's the way it is, if that's the plan of God, then who cares  whether they get off the boat or not? Who cares whether they get into the life boat, you know, go snorkel, it's all right. Because you see, we believe if it's fixed, it's fixed despite our choices, so choices  don't matter. But see, here's what Paul is.

Paul has a biblical understanding of this. Our choices matter, absolutely they matter, but they don't determine the future. Because they matter, he's not passive. So he says, let's do things the way we ought to do them. But because they don't determine the future, he's not paralyzed.

He's neither passive nor paralyzed. This 2025 comes to a close. It should come as no surprise that we have great hope for the year ahead. Because of what God is doing to bring people to faith and to renew Christians through  the Gospel teaching and resources you help us provide on our podcast, YouTube channel,  radio broadcast, quarterly journal, and website, and soon through our translation project,  we're grateful that so many of you are partnering with us to spread the message of Christ's love. Thank you.

This continues to provide opportunities for us to expand the ways we share the Gospel. In 2026, we anticipate adding new international radio broadcasts and additional online ministry  partnerships, publishing new books, and beginning to make Dr. Keller's sermons available in  other languages. So as we close out the year, we invite you to prayerfully consider making a year end  gift to Gospel in life. The year end gifts we receive are a vital part of how we will prepare for ministry in  2026.

Our support allows us to share the story of the Gospel with people in over 200 countries,  and we are deeply grateful for your participation in this mission. To make a year end gift, visit gospelonlife.com-giv, that's gospelonlife.com-giv. And please pray that we would steward your gifts well and that through the ministry of  Gospel in life, many new people will find the hope and joy of knowing Christ as Savior. Thank you for partnering with us to share the love of Christ with a world that needs  Him because the Gospel truly changes everything. Now here's Dr.

Keller with the remainder of today's message. So if you believe everything's fixed, despite our choices, you'll be passive. If you believe that our choice has actually determined the future, then you should be paralyzed. But he's neither. It's incredibly practical.

And you say, well, why would he be paralyzed? I believe my choice is to determine the future, you know? All the movies say so, back to the future, so. My choice is to determine the future. Well, you should be paralyzed.

Here's why. You know, there's a great story, short story by Ray Bradbury that you probably never read. But you've seen this, it's a short story called The Sound of Thunder. But you've heard the storyline probably because it's been used on so many Star Trek's and  Twilight Zones and all that sort of thing over the years. And The Sound of Thunder is about an illegal time machine.

And a man named Travis, for a lot of money, will take people back in that illegal time machine  to see the past. And a man named Eccles comes to pay the money to go back into time machine. But Travis says, now, when you get into the past, I want you to realize there is going  to be an anti-gravity metal path. It'll be six inches off the ground, it won't touch anything. And though we're going back into the past to see how things are, you must not get off  the path.

You mustn't even touch a blade of grass. You must stay on the path. And Eccles says, why? And here's what Travis says. He says, we'll say we accidentally kill a mouse, one mouse, by stepping on it.

That means all the future families are the families of the families of that one mouse  with a stamp of your foot. You've annihilated a billion possible mice. They're all gone. And what about the foxes that'll need those mice to survive? For one of ten mice, a fox dies.

For one of ten foxes, a lion dies. And eventually, some caveman goes out to hunt for food. But there is no food because you stepped on it. So the caveman stars, before having any children, and from his loins, would have sprung  ten sons. And from there, it's loins, tens, 100 sons, and thus, onward, a billion people, unborn,  are throttled in the womb.

Rome never rises on its seven hills. Step on a mouse and you crush the pyramids. Washington never crosses a Delaware. There's never United States. So stay on the path, he says.

Never step off. And by the way, as you know, Eccles does step, maybe if you know the story, he does step  off the path because he's too curious and he steps on a butterfly and it changes everything. So when they get back and Travis realizes he shoots him, what he did. Wonderful story, huh? It's actually quite a powerful story, but here's, don't you understand what it's saying?

Every single thing, every single thing in history is interlocked, interlaced in a million  infinite number of ways in every little change. You go this way or that way, changes everything. And if that was really completely determined by you, you haven't got the slightest bit. You don't have a millionth of the wisdom necessary to make those choices. You have no idea what all they anticipated.

You can't possibly anticipate all the changes. And what the Bible is trying to say, you don't have to. You are absolutely responsible for your choices. You're a held responsible for them. They're free.

Nobody's forcing you to do them. If you make bad choices, there'll be bad consequences. But God is the one in charge of the future. God is the one who's overruling everything. So you can do your best and then relax.

You should be paralyzed if you really believed that your choices determine the future. It would be the free will. If that was the case, it would be the most horrific gift. You shouldn't even get out of bed in the morning. But it's not.

Instead, what we can be sure of is all things work together for good to those who love  God, even though it's very intricate. Now we hardly ever see how, but let me give you one example. You know how we're here tonight? I was thinking of this example this week and you'll see why in a minute. I were here tonight.

There's a lot of reasons. All kinds of people have done so much to make this ministry and this church happen. But we could certainly say that it wouldn't be here if my wife and I've Kathy and I had  not come to New York, you know, 18 years ago or so to start the church. We wouldn't. None of this would be here.

Well why? What's the reason we came to New York to start the church? Because we joined a Presbyterian denomination that not only encouraged but gave us the freedom  and had set a priority for church planning. Well why were we a member of that Presbyterian denomination? Because my last year, my last semester in seminary, I took two courses with a professor that  convinced me that I was theologically a Presbyterian and that's the reason I went into the  denomination, that's the reason why I planted the church.

But why did I take those two courses? Because at the very, very last minute, this man was able to come and teach those courses. In spite of the fact it was a bureaucratic snag at the top that was keeping him from getting  his visa, he was British. And the only reason why he came and taught those courses and the only reason why it changed  my theological views and the only reason why I joined the Presbyterian denomination,  the only reason why he was planted the church and the only reason why we're here tonight  is because that bureaucratic snag was suddenly opened up at the last minute and he was able  to get there in time to teach me those courses. Well what opened his snag?

What happened? And the answer is one morning the dean was praying and saying, I don't know how we're going  to get this guy here in time to teach his courses this semester. And his prayer partner was a young man who was a student at my seminary at the time and  he also happened to be one of the sons of the sitting president of the United States at  the time who was Gerald Ford. He was one of Gerald Ford's sons and he was a student there. And when he asked the dean what he was praying about and the dean told him, he says, well,  you know, I have a name that you could talk to that might get you through the bureaucratic  snag and it did, it worked, it worked.

So why did he have the power to open that, to get rid of that snag so that man could come  so I could have that course so I could change my views so I could join the Presbyterian  Church so I could come and plant this church so we could be here tonight. Because only because Nixon resigned, Gerald Ford never, ever, ever, ever been president  unless Nixon resigned. But why did Nixon have to resign? Because of the Watergate scandal. And why did the Watergate scandal happen?

Because the people who were bugging the Democratic parties offices, those guys bugged it. But the night they bugged it, they left the door open. And because a night watchman noticed that the door was unlashed, he went in and it was  all discovered. Two inches. If that door had just been closed, two more inches, we wouldn't be here tonight.

Anything would have been changed. I have a question. Do you think that happened by accident that that guy kept the door open instead of closing  it? All he had to do was just pull it or turn around and say, I was at the door closed, he  didn't. Do you think that happened by accident?

And of course it's Ray Bradbury's right and he's right. If that didn't happen by accident, nothing happens by accident. All things were together for good to those who loved God and called according to his purpose. Even Watergate happened for you. And you know what?

Ray Seldom, do we even get a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a glimpse of  how God is working all things together for good to those who love God? But he is. And therefore you can be assured that no matter what bad stuff is happening inside you  and no matter how much bad stuff is happening outside you, he is not abandon you, he loves  you. Now, once you see not only that we can be assured and why we can be assured, finally  how do we really make this operative in our lives? How?

And the reason we have to talk about this just for a second at least is there's lots of  people walking around New York tonight who say, oh, I believe in a God of love. I believe that God loves everyone unconditionally. I believe He loves me no matter what I do, I believe He loves me. But it's not changing their lives because it's abstract. Love is a kind of force and it's an abstract cognitive belief and it's not operative  and their lives here is how this can change your life.

You have to personalize it. You have to personalize it two ways. You have to personalize the love of God in you and you have to personalize this assured  love of God in Christ here. First of all, how to personalize it in you. Now, here's what I mean by that.

I just gave you a great little intellectual trope, I guess you call it. How do you deal with the fact of free will and the sovereignty of God? Well, the antinomy, it's a parent contradiction, it's not a real contradiction. We don't have enough knowledge to understand how it works but it works that way. It's like light, waves and particles in that interesting.

That means that we are responsible and we have to do things and yet the same time God  is totally in control and when it's all over, everything happens according to His will. Isn't that interesting? It's kind of a nice intellectual, you know, little structure, a way of understanding. But I want you to apply it to you. I want you to personalize it right now.

I want you to apply it to you yourself and your relationship with God. Do you have a relationship with God? Have you gone to God through Jesus Christ? Now here's how it works. And this is an old illustration but it's totally true.

If you could think of a relationship with God as a door, as you're coming up to the door  over the door, you see it say, Matthew 1032. Who so ever will confess me before men, I will confess before my father? Who so ever will? In other words, as you're coming up to a relationship with God, what you're told is you've got to  do it. You've got to make a decision.

You've got to make a commitment. You have things to do. You can't be passive. But if you actually do and if you bite and if you say Lord accept me because of what  Jesus has done and you actually open that door and you walk through it, the minute you  walk through it, you turn around and you look and over the top is what is written  John 1516, you have not chosen me, I have chosen you. And John 644, no man can come to me except the father draw him.

And everybody who has ever actually moved through that door at some point realizes this,  that in spite of all the work they did and all the commitment it took and all the, you  might say in a sweat it took to make that commitment. When you get in, you start to look back and say the reason that I'm a Christian is not  because I'm more spiritual to other people, not because I'm more humble than other people,  not because I'm more valiant for truth than other people. It's simply because God kept pushing and pressing and he persistently, persistently  sought to love me till he broke me open to him. And therefore what makes me a Christian is simply, God came to me, not because I was smarter  or better, not because I was more repentant, not because I was more spiritual in any way,  it is free, absolutely free. It is totally sovereign.

Now what does this mean, I remember, when I was in college, I heard a minister speak on  a text and I changed my life, he was speaking on Deuteronomy 7. And Deuteronomy 7 is this. The Lord did not set his love upon you, O Israel, or choose you because you were the greatest  of people, for you were the least of all people. No, it was because the Lord loved you that he brought you out of Egypt with a mighty hand. And I never forget the preacher said, do you see the logic there?

It says, God says, I didn't love you because you were greater, you were actually less. I didn't love you because of this, I didn't love you because of this, I brought you out  of Egypt because I loved you. It's a circular argument. I love you just because I love you, just because I love you. And then he says, and we were all college students and none of us were married, but we  could understand.

He says, let's apply this to your spouse. If your spouse comes up to you and says, do you love me? And you say, yes. Your spouse will usually say, why? Why do you love me?

And he says, never say, well, you had such a sharper intellect than the other girls. You're really good looking. You've got great career possibilities. You're just so much, we have so much fun together. You see, if you say, I love you because of this factor or that factor or this factor or  that factor, the person's complete identity now shifts to that factor.

Because the fact factor is the basis for my value, that factor is what secures me love. But the minister says, the only way to answer a question, why do you love me is to say,  honey, I love you just because I love you. And he says, that is not just weak talk, that is not just rhetoric, that is not just  sweet, nothings. He says, there is no other way for love to operate. But when God says that to you, when God says, I don't love you because you're more spiritual,  you're more moral, you're more doctrinally sound, I love you just because I love you.

And you love me only because I kept after you and after you and after you too, I finally  broke you open. That transforms, that transforms your identity why? Because finally, I don't have to be smart, I don't have to be sophisticated, I don't have  to be make a lot of money, I don't have to be fun, I don't have to be good looking, those  factors are gone. Finally, I'm love for myself. And you see, if you know the reason why God loves you or people love you or your spouse  loves you or anybody loves you because you have a great career, you will never be able  to handle a reversal in that career.

Or because you're so talented, you'll never be able to handle competition. Or because you're so anything, you'll never be able to handle failure. But the divine, sovereign, electing grace of God, he loves you, just because he loves you. That will transform you. That person, have you personalized it?

So you have to personalize it for you, but then secondly, you have to personalize it in  Jesus. What do I mean by that? People say, oh, I believe God loves me, nothing can separate me from the love of God. Oh, I believe that, but don't think of love abstractly, Jesus is the love of God. In the Garden of Gethsemane and on the cross, you know what was happening?

All the greatest forces in the universe were arrayed against Jesus. And he could have stopped them. He could have stopped the rejection. He could have stopped the torture. He could have stopped the death.

He could have stopped the rejection of his father. He could have stopped the eternal justice coming down on his head. All he had to do was give up on us. That's all he had to do. Just walk away.

Charles Spurgeon, I think it was, who said, Jesus Christ was up on the cross, nailing, bleeding,  dying, looking down at the people betraying him and forsaking him, and denying him. And in the greatest act of love in the history of the universe, he stayed. Bomb after bomb after bomb was coming down on Jesus Christ trying to get him to drop us,  to separate him from us. See? And even hell itself couldn't do it.

He stayed. Nothing could separate him from us. His love from us. He held on to us. He was our savior.

He died for us. Now that's how you know nothing can separate you from the love of God. It's not an abstraction. Just say, oh, I just believe that God loves me unconditionally. Oh no.

He loves you counter-conditionally. He loves you against conditions because of Jesus. When you see Jesus Christ never let you go no matter what came down on him, that's how  you know. And that's the only way you really know absolutely certain that no matter what you do inside,  no matter what is bad is happening on the outside, he has not abandoned you. If he wouldn't abandon you then, he wouldn't abandon you now.

If he wouldn't abandon you when hell itself was coming down on him. And if that didn't separate his love from you, do you think you having a bad week is  going to do it? Do you think there's anything you could do that could destroy his love for you when that  couldn't do it? Or when bad things are happening to you all over and you say, oh, I must be abandoned. If he didn't abandon you there, he's not going to abandon you now.

He spared not himself. The father spared not his own son. And if he wouldn't spare that, if he wouldn't spare that, he gave us the ultimate gift. Do you think in some how he's going to let your life go off the rails now? He's not going to deny you anything you need.

If somebody spends a billion dollars on your present, do you think he's going to skimp  on the wrapping paper? This is the love you've been looking for all your life. No friend love, no married love, no popular acclaim, no parental love will give you what  this will give you. Psalms 27, 10 says, though, my mother and father forsake me, the Lord will bear me up. Your mother and father will forsake you.

Even if you have the best mother and father in the world, they're going to die. But nothing, nothing, neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers,  nor things present, nor anything to come, nor height, nor death, nor anything in all  creation, will be able to separate you from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus  or our Lord. Are you certain of that? You can be. Let's pray.

Thank you, Father, for giving to us this great assurance. And we pray that you would help us make it operative in our lives. And the Lord suffers a time to do that. Meet us now as we take these concrete elements into our hands. And as we give ourselves to you because we know that you gave yourself to us and we pray  this in Jesus' name, amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

Today, Tim Keller explores how lasting change actually happens in the life of a Christian  and why the Gospel offers a radically different process of transformation than anything  else. Tonight's scripture reading is found in Romans chapter 8, verse 28, and then verses  38 and 39. And we know that for those who love God, all things work together for good, for those  who are called according to His purpose. Where I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither  the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything  else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ  Jesus our Lord. This is God's Word.

We've been looking for a few weeks at Romans 6, 7, and 8, and we said that this is especially  about how Jesus concretely changes your life when He comes into it. And what I wanted to do was just one last time, I wanted to look at this ending of Romans  chapter 8. It's a magnificent ending, and yet its point is very simple. In these last several verses, in these last several verses Paul says, here's the thing  I'm giving you that will absolutely change your life through Christ. And the thing that He's giving us is an assurance.

He says, this is the thing you can get out every day and use. This is the thing that will change your life. But as He expresses the assurance, for us in our modern Western culture, a question comes  up. So it's very hard for us in our modern Western culture just to receive this thing and to enjoy  it and to use it unimpeded. So what we're going to do tonight is look at this assurance, actually first let me read  it to you.

Let me read you the whole last 12 verses. Listen to what He's saying. It's really saying one thing. I read it in a slightly different translation. And we know that all things are working together for good, for those who love God and who  are called according to His purpose.

For those who for new, He predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son. And those He predestined, He called. And those He called, He justified. And those He justified, He glorified. What then shall we say to these things?

If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up for us all. How will He not also together with Him freely give us all things? Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies who is to condemn.

It is Christ who died. More than that was raised than is ever at the right hand of God interceding for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? No.

In all things, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through Him who loved  us. We are absolutely certain that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor  powers nor things present nor anything to come nor height nor depth nor anything  in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus  our Lord. There's an assurance there and I'd like to look at them to three headings. That we can be assured, why we can be assured and how we can be assured, how we can make  this assurance, not just an abstraction, but an operative thing in our lives. That we can be assured, why we can be assured and how we can be assured.

First, briefly, that we can be assured, what is His point? Here's His point, there's a joy to be had. There's a joy to be had that if you have it, we'll enable you to face anything in life  without sinking or crumbling. And this joy is a certitude, it's a certainty, an absolute certainty that God doesn't just  love you now, it's a certainty that He does love you now in Christ, but He always will. And nothing can shake that and nothing can separate you from that, no matter what.

The Lord of the universe loves you not just now, but always will. That's the assurance. And this assurance is two forks. Because once you've connected with God through Jesus Christ, this assurance is two forks. The first is, well, I'll tell you what the two forks are right off, it means that God loves  you no matter what bad stuff is happening inside you, and no matter how much bad stuff is  happening outside you, no matter how bad the stuff is happening inside you, no matter  how bad the stuff is that's happening outside you, you can be sure He still loves you.

See, first of all, no matter how bad stuff is going on inside you, sometimes we do some  awful stuff. I want you to know that there is stuff in your heart that you don't know about yet. And then when it pops up, you're going to say, I can't believe I'm capable of that. And you're going to be so dissolution with yourself and you're going to be so mad  yourself. And when those times happen, what do you say?

You say, I can't believe that God could love me after I've done that. And yet here's what Paul says, he says, who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies who is to condemn. It is Christ Jesus who died. More than that was raised and is ever at the right hand of God, interceding for us.

Not one thing that you can possibly do today can bring you back into condemnation. It's all covered. It's all paid for, see. God loves you no matter how much bad stuff happens inside you. But secondly, we're told, the other fork of the assurance, is that God loves you no matter  how much bad stuff is happening outside you.

You see this list, tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, danger, sword. See, when bad stuff happens, when everything is going wrong, you feel like God doesn't  love me or he wouldn't let all this stuff happen. See, really bad stuff happens inside. You say, oh, look at what a mess I am, God couldn't love me. But when really bad stuff happens outside, you say, look what a mess life is.

Obviously, God has abandoned me. There can't be a loving God, and yet Paul says, oh, yes, there can be. No matter how bad the mess is on the outside, you still can be assured, he says that God  loves you, because he says in verse 28, what? He says, all things are working together for good to those that love God. Now what does that mean?

Taken together as a whole, look at from the long term. Every single thing that happens, every single thing God is working together into a plan  for our good and for His glory. That's what it says. And my favorite biblical example of that are two incidents that happen in a place called  Dothan. In Genesis, the first thing that happens at Dothan is that Joseph is thrown into a pit  by his brothers, and he's going to be sold into slavery.

So he's got a life of absolute misery ahead of him, and he prays to God, oh, God, get me  out of this. Don't let me be sold into slavery. And guess what, silence, silence. And he is sold into slavery, and he has a horrible miserable life for years and years and  years and years. And then many centuries later, the second thing that happens in Dothan, Elisha is in  Dothan.

Now it's a city, and it's besieged by an enemy, and he's afraid that they're going to be  overrun and destroyed. And Elisha cries out the God and says, oh, Lord, please save us. Please save us from this peril. And this time, God sends chariots of fire and wipes out the invading army and everybody  saved. But if you know the story of Joseph, you know that if he hadn't been sold into slavery,  and if he hadn't gone through all those years of misery, not only would have hundreds  of thousands of people died of famine, but his own family would have been destroyed  by their own sin.

And what that means, if you know the story, you know how it works out, and what that  means is that God was just as actively working everything together for good in Joseph's  life as in Elisha's life. He was just as actively working in the seeming slowness and non-answer to Joseph as he  was in the swift, noisy answer to Elisha. And so Paul says, that's always the case. And so no matter how much bad stuff's happening inside you, no matter how much bad stuff's  happening outside you, you can be assured God absolutely and fallibly, unchangeably loves  you. And then when he gets to the very end, he has a sweeping statement in verse 38 and 39,  which is printed out there.

And at this point, Paul says, I am absolutely certain. He uses the word that means absolute intent, certainty and persuasion. And then he just bursts. He pushes. He stretches out to the limits of language to try to say neither death nor life nor angels  nor principalities, nor heaven, nor hell nor height nor death, nothing.

Nothing can separate you for the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord, nothing. Nothing can dislodge you from his love and nothing can dislodge his love from you. And there are people who have looked at this passage and said, oh, well, yes, but nothing  can separate you from God, but you could separate yourself. Because if you start out to follow Jesus and you turn back, you can lose your salvation,  you can lose his love. So maybe nothing can separate you from God's love, but you can separate yourself.

And that is not right. That is not the right way to read that text. And I'll tell you why. Look, what does it say? If you could turn back, if you could separate yourself from the love of God, aren't you  part of creation?

He says, nothing at all of creation can separate you from the love of God. Aren't you part of creation? Last, by my look, you were. What Paul is trying to say is every possible situation that might turn you away from God,  every possible situation that might turn you away from God, persecution, torture. None of those things will.

Because love is so powerful, they will keep you facing him, keep you loving him, keep  you in his arms no matter what. So see, here's your assurance, no matter how much all the powers of evil inside you and  all the powers of evil outside you cannot separate you from the love of God, can't dislodge  you from it, can't dislodge love of God from you. Once you give yourself to God through Christ, He is yours, you are His, nothing ever, ever  can change that, that's the assurance. Now we could, it would be great if we could just move on and say, so now how does that work  in your life what we can't? Because as I said, in our Western culture, this sort of, this promise immediately raises  an issue.

Now the reason I say Western culture is pretty important, because we have an objection that  really bothers us, all this talk about predestination, right? And calling an election, God working everything out according to His plan, now this bothers  us, but don't forget who us is, it's us, there's other centuries and there's other cultures  that this doesn't bother, this is a problem for a modern Western enlightenment drenched,  individualistic people. And it's always good to remember that, this great objection we have, we must not absolutize  any of our objections, they always arise out of our culture and we should take it seriously  because here's where we live. But it's not, you know, we're not the only culture in the world and we shouldn't therefore  say this is an insuperable obstacle to faith in Christ. However, here's the thing that modern Western people say, when they hear that Jesus Christ  will keep you in His love so that no matter what we do, we'll never stop loving Him and  He'll never stop loving us.

And He's totally in control of everything so everything is working out according to His  plan. The first thing that comes to our mind is, well, hey, what about free will then? See, that's our problem. What about human responsibility? Because it sounds like God is doing all this stuff despite our choices, that everything  is going to happen, is going to happen in spite of our choices.

And if that's the case, well, then who cares how you live? Who cares what you do? It's all going to happen, see? You know, I'm a Christian so now, you know, it doesn't really matter. I don't have to do anything because He's going to keep me loving Him and everything's  working out according to His plan.

Well, then it doesn't really matter. So what happens to free will and what happens to personal responsibility? That's a good question. And in modern, when I said this is a Western issue in particular, we're reminded of that  this last week in the Science Times, New York Times. On Tuesday, there was a big article, and the name of it was the power of free will.

Now you have it, now you don't. And it was a kind of survey of the current debate right now about whether we have free will  or not. And the consensus of most of the scientists and the people in the article was we don't. Now it's intriguing for a person of my age is it's interesting that the last, you know,  now the real question is, do we have free will or are we determined by our evolutionary  biology? That's the issue now.

See, the argument is that natural selection is what determines everything about us. So we think we're choosing to love someone or fall in love with someone. We think we're choosing that, but actually we're hardwired to do that to pass on our  genetic material, so we don't really have free will. And so that's the debate. Do we have free will or not, or are we hardwired by our biology?

It's funny, because 30 years ago when I was in college, the argument was a psychological  one, not a biological one. The argument was a Freudian one, as it were, and that is, do we have free will or are  we completely controlled by our unconscious urges or our past or things like that? But the thing you always see in all these debates in the West is it's either or, either  or, either we free have free will or everything is determined or put it this way. We believe either we have free will and we're responsible for our choices and our choices  matter, and that means the future is open and undetermined either we have free will  and the future is open undetermined or something has set and fixed the future and then our  choices don't matter. See, it's either or, but in the Bible, it's never either or, never.

From the beginning to the end, in principle and in practice, it's always this, you are  free and you are responsible and your choices matter and you're responsible for your choices  and no one's forcing you to make those choices and yet, every single thing that happens  as a result of those choices is worked out, is working out exactly according to the plan  of God. And it's not just that God foresees what you're going to do, but rather what you do fits  in with the plan that He wants and the course that He wants history to take. There's so many examples I could give you, I'll just start with, I'll give you two. First of all, principle, listen to these proverbs, this is from Proverbs 16, verse 1. To man belongs the plans of the heart, but from the Lord comes the reply of the tongue.

And verse 9, the heart of man plans his way, but it is the Lord who establishes his steps. Hear that? To you belong the plans of your heart, but what you do as a result of the plan comes from God. To you belongs your plans, but when you actually speak or act, that always fits in with God's  plan, always. Now, that's astounding.

See, on the one hand it says, your plans, your choices belong to you. They're yours. They're not coerced. God is not doing it for you and you can't say I couldn't help it. They're yours.

You are free. You are responsible. The result is always exactly what God wants. You say, how can that be? Well, that's because you're a Westerner and it's always either or, why does it have to  be either or?

Can't God? Isn't it possible? The God could actually fix things and work things out and at the same time not violate  your free will? Why couldn't God do that? I can't imagine how I could do it.

No. Of course you can't, but you're under qualify for this job of God. Jack Packer puts it fascinatingly in his book, Evangelism and the Sovereignty of God. He says the relationship of our free will and responsibility and God's sovereignty and  control of all things is an antinomy. An antinomy, he defines, is not a contradiction but an apparent contradiction.

And the example he uses is light. We know that light sometimes acts and behaves as waves and sometimes as particles. Because it acts as if it does not have, it does not consist of matter and sometimes it  acts as if it does. Now we don't know how that could be. It shouldn't be, but it is.

We don't know how that works, but we know it does work that way. And so we work with it, otherwise you're not going to know how to handle light. And Jack Packer says, see, it's obviously not a real contradiction, it's just an apparent  contradiction. We don't have the knowledge to figure it out, it's the same thing here. And if you want to see that we are absolutely, on the one hand, God is setting and fixing  absolutely everything the way he wants it to be, but he doesn't do that despite our choices.

But through them, our choices are part of his plan. And you say, oh, so he just knows what we're going to choose. Yeah, but it's more than that. See, there you go. You want to do the either or thing.

No, it's both in. Both in. In Acts chapter 27, this is my favorite example in the Bible of this, Paul is on a boat with  sailors and soldiers in a terrible storm, terrible storm. And in the midst of the storm when everybody's scared, the sailors and soldiers are really  afraid that they're going to die, God sends an angel to Paul and says, the ship will  be wrecked, but not one life will be lost. So Paul comes out on the deck and says, God has spoken to me.

And he has said that even though the ship will be wrecked, not one life will be lost. And now, Paul believed that, you know why? In the Old Testament, if you're a prophet and you make a prophecy, and that prophecy doesn't  come true, the prophets put to death, you know why? Because the Word of God is always sure. And if he actually gave you the Word of God, then it has to come true.

So Paul was absolutely sure that it was God's plan and it was absolutely certain that no  life would be lost. But in verse 31 of Acts 27, it turns out that the sailors decide they were going to,  you know, the storm is continuing on and the sailors decide they were going to sneak  off the boat. So they start to get into the life boat. And when Paul sees the sailors, trying to get off the boat, he tells the soldiers to stop  them and he says, if they leave the boat, we're all going to die. Now I believe this is the beginning of the great army navy rivalry, actually.

But beyond that, this doesn't make sense to us, doesn't it? Wait a minute, we would say to Paul, look, if you really believe that no one's life is  going to be lost, if that's the way it is, if that's the plan of God, then who cares  whether they get off the boat or not? Who cares whether they get into the life boat, you know, go snorkel, it's all right. Because you see, we believe if it's fixed, it's fixed despite our choices, so choices  don't matter. But see, here's what Paul is.

Paul has a biblical understanding of this. Our choices matter, absolutely they matter, but they don't determine the future. Because they matter, he's not passive. So he says, let's do things the way we ought to do them. But because they don't determine the future, he's not paralyzed.

He's neither passive nor paralyzed. This 2025 comes to a close. It should come as no surprise that we have great hope for the year ahead. Because of what God is doing to bring people to faith and to renew Christians through  the Gospel teaching and resources you help us provide on our podcast, YouTube channel,  radio broadcast, quarterly journal, and website, and soon through our translation project,  we're grateful that so many of you are partnering with us to spread the message of Christ's love.

And please pray that we would steward your gifts well and that through the ministry of  Gospel in life, many new people will find the hope and joy of knowing Christ as Savior. Thank you for partnering with us to share the love of Christ with a world that needs  Him because the Gospel truly changes everything. Now here's Dr.

Keller with the remainder of today's message. So if you believe everything's fixed, despite our choices, you'll be passive. If you believe that our choice has actually determined the future, then you should be paralyzed. But he's neither. It's incredibly practical.

And you say, well, why would he be paralyzed? I believe my choice is to determine the future, you know? All the movies say so, back to the future, so. My choice is to determine the future. Well, you should be paralyzed.

Here's why. You know, there's a great story, short story by Ray Bradbury that you probably never read. But you've seen this, it's a short story called The Sound of Thunder. But you've heard the storyline probably because it's been used on so many Star Trek's and  Twilight Zones and all that sort of thing over the years. And The Sound of Thunder is about an illegal time machine.

And a man named Travis, for a lot of money, will take people back in that illegal time machine  to see the past. And a man named Eccles comes to pay the money to go back into time machine. But Travis says, now, when you get into the past, I want you to realize there is going  to be an anti-gravity metal path. It'll be six inches off the ground, it won't touch anything. And though we're going back into the past to see how things are, you must not get off  the path.

You mustn't even touch a blade of grass. You must stay on the path. And Eccles says, why? And here's what Travis says. He says, we'll say we accidentally kill a mouse, one mouse, by stepping on it.

That means all the future families are the families of the families of that one mouse  with a stamp of your foot. You've annihilated a billion possible mice. They're all gone. And what about the foxes that'll need those mice to survive? For one of ten mice, a fox dies.

For one of ten foxes, a lion dies. And eventually, some caveman goes out to hunt for food. But there is no food because you stepped on it. So the caveman stars, before having any children, and from his loins, would have sprung  ten sons. And from there, it's loins, tens, 100 sons, and thus, onward, a billion people, unborn,  are throttled in the womb.

Rome never rises on its seven hills. Step on a mouse and you crush the pyramids. Washington never crosses a Delaware. There's never United States. So stay on the path, he says.

Never step off. And by the way, as you know, Eccles does step, maybe if you know the story, he does step  off the path because he's too curious and he steps on a butterfly and it changes everything. So when they get back and Travis realizes he shoots him, what he did. Wonderful story, huh? It's actually quite a powerful story, but here's, don't you understand what it's saying?

Every single thing, every single thing in history is interlocked, interlaced in a million  infinite number of ways in every little change. You go this way or that way, changes everything. And if that was really completely determined by you, you haven't got the slightest bit. You don't have a millionth of the wisdom necessary to make those choices. You have no idea what all they anticipated.

You can't possibly anticipate all the changes. And what the Bible is trying to say, you don't have to. You are absolutely responsible for your choices. You're a held responsible for them. They're free.

Nobody's forcing you to do them. If you make bad choices, there'll be bad consequences. But God is the one in charge of the future. God is the one who's overruling everything. So you can do your best and then relax.

You should be paralyzed if you really believed that your choices determine the future. It would be the free will. If that was the case, it would be the most horrific gift. You shouldn't even get out of bed in the morning. But it's not.

Instead, what we can be sure of is all things work together for good to those who love  God, even though it's very intricate. Now we hardly ever see how, but let me give you one example. You know how we're here tonight? I was thinking of this example this week and you'll see why in a minute. I were here tonight.

There's a lot of reasons. All kinds of people have done so much to make this ministry and this church happen. But we could certainly say that it wouldn't be here if my wife and I've Kathy and I had  not come to New York, you know, 18 years ago or so to start the church. We wouldn't. None of this would be here.

Well why? What's the reason we came to New York to start the church? Because we joined a Presbyterian denomination that not only encouraged but gave us the freedom  and had set a priority for church planning. Well why were we a member of that Presbyterian denomination? Because my last year, my last semester in seminary, I took two courses with a professor that  convinced me that I was theologically a Presbyterian and that's the reason I went into the  denomination, that's the reason why I planted the church.

But why did I take those two courses? Because at the very, very last minute, this man was able to come and teach those courses. In spite of the fact it was a bureaucratic snag at the top that was keeping him from getting  his visa, he was British. And the only reason why he came and taught those courses and the only reason why it changed  my theological views and the only reason why I joined the Presbyterian denomination,  the only reason why he was planted the church and the only reason why we're here tonight  is because that bureaucratic snag was suddenly opened up at the last minute and he was able  to get there in time to teach me those courses. Well what opened his snag?

What happened? And the answer is one morning the dean was praying and saying, I don't know how we're going  to get this guy here in time to teach his courses this semester. And his prayer partner was a young man who was a student at my seminary at the time and  he also happened to be one of the sons of the sitting president of the United States at  the time who was Gerald Ford. He was one of Gerald Ford's sons and he was a student there. And when he asked the dean what he was praying about and the dean told him, he says, well,  you know, I have a name that you could talk to that might get you through the bureaucratic  snag and it did, it worked, it worked.

So why did he have the power to open that, to get rid of that snag so that man could come  so I could have that course so I could change my views so I could join the Presbyterian  Church so I could come and plant this church so we could be here tonight. Because only because Nixon resigned, Gerald Ford never, ever, ever, ever been president  unless Nixon resigned. But why did Nixon have to resign? Because of the Watergate scandal. And why did the Watergate scandal happen?

Because the people who were bugging the Democratic parties offices, those guys bugged it. But the night they bugged it, they left the door open. And because a night watchman noticed that the door was unlashed, he went in and it was  all discovered. Two inches. If that door had just been closed, two more inches, we wouldn't be here tonight.

Anything would have been changed. I have a question. Do you think that happened by accident that that guy kept the door open instead of closing  it? All he had to do was just pull it or turn around and say, I was at the door closed, he  didn't. Do you think that happened by accident?

And of course it's Ray Bradbury's right and he's right. If that didn't happen by accident, nothing happens by accident. All things were together for good to those who loved God and called according to his purpose. Even Watergate happened for you. And you know what?

Ray Seldom, do we even get a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a glimpse of  how God is working all things together for good to those who love God? But he is. And therefore you can be assured that no matter what bad stuff is happening inside you  and no matter how much bad stuff is happening outside you, he is not abandon you, he loves  you. Now, once you see not only that we can be assured and why we can be assured, finally  how do we really make this operative in our lives? How?

And the reason we have to talk about this just for a second at least is there's lots of  people walking around New York tonight who say, oh, I believe in a God of love. I believe that God loves everyone unconditionally. I believe He loves me no matter what I do, I believe He loves me. But it's not changing their lives because it's abstract. Love is a kind of force and it's an abstract cognitive belief and it's not operative  and their lives here is how this can change your life.

You have to personalize it. You have to personalize it two ways. You have to personalize the love of God in you and you have to personalize this assured  love of God in Christ here. First of all, how to personalize it in you. Now, here's what I mean by that.

I just gave you a great little intellectual trope, I guess you call it. How do you deal with the fact of free will and the sovereignty of God? Well, the antinomy, it's a parent contradiction, it's not a real contradiction. We don't have enough knowledge to understand how it works but it works that way. It's like light, waves and particles in that interesting.

That means that we are responsible and we have to do things and yet the same time God  is totally in control and when it's all over, everything happens according to His will. Isn't that interesting? It's kind of a nice intellectual, you know, little structure, a way of understanding. But I want you to apply it to you. I want you to personalize it right now.

I want you to apply it to you yourself and your relationship with God. Do you have a relationship with God? Have you gone to God through Jesus Christ? Now here's how it works. And this is an old illustration but it's totally true.

If you could think of a relationship with God as a door, as you're coming up to the door  over the door, you see it say, Matthew 1032. Who so ever will confess me before men, I will confess before my father? Who so ever will? In other words, as you're coming up to a relationship with God, what you're told is you've got to  do it. You've got to make a decision.

You've got to make a commitment. You have things to do. You can't be passive. But if you actually do and if you bite and if you say Lord accept me because of what  Jesus has done and you actually open that door and you walk through it, the minute you  walk through it, you turn around and you look and over the top is what is written  John 1516, you have not chosen me, I have chosen you. And John 644, no man can come to me except the father draw him.

And everybody who has ever actually moved through that door at some point realizes this,  that in spite of all the work they did and all the commitment it took and all the, you  might say in a sweat it took to make that commitment. When you get in, you start to look back and say the reason that I'm a Christian is not  because I'm more spiritual to other people, not because I'm more humble than other people,  not because I'm more valiant for truth than other people. It's simply because God kept pushing and pressing and he persistently, persistently  sought to love me till he broke me open to him. And therefore what makes me a Christian is simply, God came to me, not because I was smarter  or better, not because I was more repentant, not because I was more spiritual in any way,  it is free, absolutely free. It is totally sovereign.

Now what does this mean, I remember, when I was in college, I heard a minister speak on  a text and I changed my life, he was speaking on Deuteronomy 7. And Deuteronomy 7 is this. The Lord did not set his love upon you, O Israel, or choose you because you were the greatest  of people, for you were the least of all people. No, it was because the Lord loved you that he brought you out of Egypt with a mighty hand. And I never forget the preacher said, do you see the logic there?

It says, God says, I didn't love you because you were greater, you were actually less. I didn't love you because of this, I didn't love you because of this, I brought you out  of Egypt because I loved you. It's a circular argument. I love you just because I love you, just because I love you. And then he says, and we were all college students and none of us were married, but we  could understand.

He says, let's apply this to your spouse. If your spouse comes up to you and says, do you love me? And you say, yes. Your spouse will usually say, why? Why do you love me?

And he says, never say, well, you had such a sharper intellect than the other girls. You're really good looking. You've got great career possibilities. You're just so much, we have so much fun together. You see, if you say, I love you because of this factor or that factor or this factor or  that factor, the person's complete identity now shifts to that factor.

Because the fact factor is the basis for my value, that factor is what secures me love. But the minister says, the only way to answer a question, why do you love me is to say,  honey, I love you just because I love you. And he says, that is not just weak talk, that is not just rhetoric, that is not just  sweet, nothings. He says, there is no other way for love to operate. But when God says that to you, when God says, I don't love you because you're more spiritual,  you're more moral, you're more doctrinally sound, I love you just because I love you.

And you love me only because I kept after you and after you and after you too, I finally  broke you open. That transforms, that transforms your identity why? Because finally, I don't have to be smart, I don't have to be sophisticated, I don't have  to be make a lot of money, I don't have to be fun, I don't have to be good looking, those  factors are gone. Finally, I'm love for myself. And you see, if you know the reason why God loves you or people love you or your spouse  loves you or anybody loves you because you have a great career, you will never be able  to handle a reversal in that career.

Or because you're so talented, you'll never be able to handle competition. Or because you're so anything, you'll never be able to handle failure. But the divine, sovereign, electing grace of God, he loves you, just because he loves you. That will transform you. That person, have you personalized it?

So you have to personalize it for you, but then secondly, you have to personalize it in  Jesus. What do I mean by that? People say, oh, I believe God loves me, nothing can separate me from the love of God. Oh, I believe that, but don't think of love abstractly, Jesus is the love of God. In the Garden of Gethsemane and on the cross, you know what was happening?

All the greatest forces in the universe were arrayed against Jesus. And he could have stopped them. He could have stopped the rejection. He could have stopped the torture. He could have stopped the death.

He could have stopped the rejection of his father. He could have stopped the eternal justice coming down on his head. All he had to do was give up on us. That's all he had to do. Just walk away.

Charles Spurgeon, I think it was, who said, Jesus Christ was up on the cross, nailing, bleeding,  dying, looking down at the people betraying him and forsaking him, and denying him. And in the greatest act of love in the history of the universe, he stayed. Bomb after bomb after bomb was coming down on Jesus Christ trying to get him to drop us,  to separate him from us. See? And even hell itself couldn't do it.

He stayed. Nothing could separate him from us. His love from us. He held on to us. He was our savior.

He died for us. Now that's how you know nothing can separate you from the love of God. It's not an abstraction. Just say, oh, I just believe that God loves me unconditionally. Oh no.

He loves you counter-conditionally. He loves you against conditions because of Jesus. When you see Jesus Christ never let you go no matter what came down on him, that's how  you know. And that's the only way you really know absolutely certain that no matter what you do inside,  no matter what is bad is happening on the outside, he has not abandoned you. If he wouldn't abandon you then, he wouldn't abandon you now.

If he wouldn't abandon you when hell itself was coming down on him. And if that didn't separate his love from you, do you think you having a bad week is  going to do it? Do you think there's anything you could do that could destroy his love for you when that  couldn't do it? Or when bad things are happening to you all over and you say, oh, I must be abandoned. If he didn't abandon you there, he's not going to abandon you now.

He spared not himself. The father spared not his own son. And if he wouldn't spare that, if he wouldn't spare that, he gave us the ultimate gift. Do you think in some how he's going to let your life go off the rails now? He's not going to deny you anything you need.

If somebody spends a billion dollars on your present, do you think he's going to skimp  on the wrapping paper? This is the love you've been looking for all your life. No friend love, no married love, no popular acclaim, no parental love will give you what  this will give you. Psalms 27, 10 says, though, my mother and father forsake me, the Lord will bear me up. Your mother and father will forsake you.

Even if you have the best mother and father in the world, they're going to die. But nothing, nothing, neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers,  nor things present, nor anything to come, nor height, nor death, nor anything in all  creation, will be able to separate you from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus  or our Lord. Are you certain of that? You can be. Let's pray.

Thank you, Father, for giving to us this great assurance. And we pray that you would help us make it operative in our lives. And the Lord suffers a time to do that. Meet us now as we take these concrete elements into our hands. And as we give ourselves to you because we know that you gave yourself to us and we pray  this in Jesus' name, amen.

今天，提姆·凯勒探讨基督徒生命中持久的改变究竟如何发生，以及为什么福音所提供的转变过程，与其他任何方式都截然不同。今晚的经文读自《罗马书》第8章28节，以及38—39节。

“我们晓得，万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处，就是按祂旨意被召的人。

“因为我深信：无论是死，是生，是天使，是鬼魔，是现在的事，是将来的事，是有权柄的，是高处的，是低处的，是别的受造之物，都不能叫我们与神的爱隔绝；这爱是在我们的主基督耶稣里的。”

这是神的话。

我们这几个星期一直在看《罗马书》6、7、8章，我们说这特别是在讲：当耶稣进入你的生命时，祂如何具体地改变你的生活。我想做的是最后一次，来看看《罗马书》第8章的结尾。这是一个宏伟的结尾，但它的要点非常简单。

在这最后几节经文里，保罗说：这是我给你们的、借着基督必定改变你生命的东西。而祂给我们的东西，就是一种确据。

他说：这是你每天都可以拿出来使用的东西。这是会改变你生命的东西。但是当他表达这种确据时，对我们这些现代西方文化中的人来说，就会冒出一个问题。

所以，对我们现代西方文化的人而言，要毫无阻碍地领受、享受并使用这个应许，其实很不容易。因此今晚我们要来看看这份确据——其实我先把它读给你。

让我把最后12节都读给你听。听听他在说什么。其实他只是在说一件事。我用的是一个稍微不同的译本。

“我们晓得，万事都在一同为着益处而工作，临到那些爱神、并按祂旨意蒙召的人。

“因为祂所预先认识的人，祂也预定他们效法祂儿子的形像。祂所预定的人，祂也呼召；祂所呼召的人，祂也称义；祂所称义的人，祂也叫他们得荣耀。

“这样，这些事我们还要说什么呢？若神帮助我们，谁能敌挡我们呢？神既不爱惜自己的儿子，为我们众人舍了，岂不也把万物和祂一同白白地赐给我们吗？谁能控告神所拣选的人呢？有神称他们为义；谁能定他们的罪呢？有基督耶稣已经死了，并且复活，如今在神的右边，也替我们代求。

“谁能使我们与基督的爱隔绝呢？是患难吗？是困苦吗？是逼迫吗？是饥饿吗？是赤身露体吗？是危险吗？是刀剑吗？不。

“然而，靠着那爱我们的主，在这一切事上，我们已经得胜有余。

“因为我深信：无论是死，是生，是天使，是掌权的，是有权能的，是现在的事，是将来的事，是高处的，是低处的，或受造之物中的任何别的事，都不能叫我们与神的爱隔绝；这爱是在我们的主基督耶稣里的。”

这里面有一种确据，我想用三个标题来讲：我们可以确信什么；我们为何可以确信；以及我们如何可以确信——也就是如何让这种确据不只是一个抽象概念，而是成为我们生命中真正起作用的东西。我们可以确信什么、为何可以确信、以及如何可以确信。

第一，很简要地说，我们可以确信什么——他的重点是什么？重点是：有一种喜乐可以拥有；一旦你拥有它，你就能面对人生任何事情而不至于下沉、崩溃。

而这种喜乐是一种“确信”，一种“确定”，一种绝对的确定：神不仅现在爱你；当然是在基督里祂此刻爱你——但祂将永远爱你。没有任何事能动摇这一点，没有任何事能把你与这一点隔开，无论发生什么。

宇宙的主不仅现在爱你，而且永远都会爱你。这就是确据。

而这确据有两个“叉路”——因为一旦你借着耶稣基督与神连结，这确据就分成两个方面。第一——我先把两个方面直接告诉你——它意味着：无论你里面发生了多少糟糕的事，无论你外面发生了多少糟糕的事，无论你里面发生的事多么糟糕，无论你外面发生的事多么糟糕，你都可以确定祂仍然爱你。

你看，首先，无论你里面发生多糟的事。有时候我们会做一些非常可怕的事。我想让你知道：你心里有些东西你现在还不知道。等它冒出来时，你会说：我不敢相信我竟然有这种能力。

你会对自己极其幻灭，你会对自己非常生气。到了那种时候，你会说什么？

你会说：我不敢相信我做了那样的事之后，神还能爱我。

然而保罗怎么说？他说：“谁能控告神所拣选的人呢？有神称他们为义；谁能定他们的罪呢？有基督耶稣已经死了，并且复活，如今在神的右边，也替我们代求。”

你今天无论做什么，都不可能再把你带回到被定罪的状态。全都被遮盖了，全都被付清了。你看，神爱你，不管你里面发生多少糟糕的事。

但第二，我们被告知，这确据的另一个方面是：神爱你，不管你外面发生多少糟糕的事。

你看到这份清单：患难、困苦、逼迫、饥饿、赤身露体、危险、刀剑。

你看，当坏事发生、当一切都出问题时，你会觉得：神不爱我，否则祂不会让这些事发生。

当很糟糕的事发生在你里面时，你说：唉，看我多么一团糟，神不可能爱我。

但当很糟糕的事发生在你外面时，你说：看生活多么一团糟。显然神已经离弃了我。怎么可能有一位慈爱的神？

然而保罗说：哦，是的，当然可以。

无论外面的混乱有多糟，你仍然可以确信神爱你。因为他在第28节说了什么？他说：“万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处。”这是什么意思？

把它们合在一起，从长远来看。每一件发生的事，神都在把它们编织进一个计划里，为了我们的益处，也为了祂的荣耀。

这就是它所说的。

我最喜欢的圣经例子，是在一个叫多坍的地方发生的两件事。

在《创世记》里，多坍发生的第一件事是：约瑟被他的兄弟们扔进坑里，后来要被卖为奴。

于是他前面似乎是绝对悲惨的人生；他向神祷告说：“哦，神啊，把我救出去。不要让我被卖为奴。”结果呢？沉默，沉默。

他就被卖为奴，过了许多年、许多年、许多年、许多年痛苦悲惨的日子。

而几个世纪之后，多坍发生的第二件事：以利沙在多坍。

那是一座城，被敌军围困；他害怕他们会被攻破、被毁灭。

以利沙向神呼求说：“哦，主啊，求你拯救我们。求你救我们脱离这危险。”这一次，神差遣火车火马，消灭了入侵的军队，众人都得救。

但如果你知道约瑟的故事，你就知道：如果他没有被卖为奴；如果他没有经历那些多年的苦难——不但会有几十万人死于饥荒，而且他自己的家族也会因他们自己的罪而被毁灭。

这意味着：如果你知道故事如何收场，你就明白：神在约瑟生命中“使万事一同效力叫他得益处”的工作，和在以利沙生命中的工作同样积极。

神在对约瑟似乎缓慢、无声、没有回应的时候，和对以利沙迅速、轰动的回应一样积极地作工。

所以保罗说：总是如此。

因此，无论你里面发生多少糟糕的事，无论你外面发生多少糟糕的事，你都可以确信：神绝对、毫无错失、不可改变地爱你。

当他说到最后，他在38、39节有一个极其宏大的总结（就印在那儿）。

这时保罗说：“我深信。”他用的那个词，意思是绝对的意向、确定与确信。

然后他就爆发出来。他推动、拉伸语言到极限，试着说：无论是死，是生，是天使，是掌权的，是高处，是低处——什么都不能。

没有任何事能使你与神的爱隔绝；这爱是在我们的主基督耶稣里的。没有任何事。

没有任何事能把你从祂的爱中撬开；也没有任何事能把祂对你的爱从你身上撬走。

有人看这段经文就说：哦，是的，没什么能把你与神分开，但你可以把自己分开。因为如果你一开始跟随耶稣，后来又回头，你就可能失去救恩，失去祂的爱。

所以也许没什么能把你与神的爱隔绝，但你自己可以把自己隔绝。

这不对。这不是读这段经文的正确方式。我告诉你为什么。

看，经文怎么说？如果你能回头、如果你能把自己与神的爱隔开，你不也是受造之物的一部分吗？

他说：受造界里没有任何东西能使你与神的爱隔绝。你不也是受造界的一部分吗？照我看来，你是。

保罗想说的是：每一种可能使你转离神的处境——每一种可能使你转离神的处境：逼迫、酷刑——都不会。

因为爱是如此强大：它会让你一直面对祂、一直爱祂、一直在祂怀里，无论发生什么。

所以你看，这就是你的确据：无论你里面一切邪恶的势力多强，无论你外面一切邪恶的势力多强，都不能使你与神的爱隔绝；不能把你从其中撬开；不能把神的爱从你身上撬走。

一旦你借着基督把自己交给神，祂就是你的，你就是祂的；没有任何事、永远永远都不能改变这一点。这就是确据。

如果我们可以就这样继续下去说：“那么这在你生命里怎么运作？”那当然很好，但我们不能。因为正如我说，在我们的西方文化里，这种应许立刻就引发一个议题。

我之所以说是西方文化很重要，是因为我们有一个让我们很困扰的反对意见：关于“预定”的一切，对吧？呼召与拣选，神按祂的计划使万事成就——这让我们不舒服。

但别忘了，“我们”是谁？是我们。还有别的世纪、别的文化，这并不会困扰他们；这是一个现代西方、被启蒙思潮浸透、个人主义的人才会有的问题。

记住这一点总是好的：我们提出的巨大反对，并不该被绝对化；它总是从我们的文化里生出来的。我们应当认真对待，因为我们就生活在这里。

但这并不意味着——你知道，我们并不是世界上唯一的文化，因此我们不该说：这是信靠基督不可逾越的障碍。

不过，现代西方的人听到：耶稣基督会保守你在祂的爱里，使得无论发生什么，我们都不会停止爱祂，祂也不会停止爱我们。

并且祂完全掌管一切，所以万事都按祂的计划运行。

我们脑海里第一个冒出来的念头就是：那自由意志怎么办？这就是我们的问题。人的责任怎么办？

因为听起来好像神在我们选择之外做了这一切：一切将要发生的事，都会发生，不管我们的选择如何。

如果是那样，那谁还在乎你怎么活？在乎你做什么？反正都会发生。

你知道，“我已经是基督徒了，所以其实也没那么重要。我什么都不用做，因为祂会保守我继续爱祂，万事也都按祂的计划运行。”

那就好像真的不重要了。

那么自由意志在哪里？个人责任在哪里？

这是个好问题。

当我说这是特别西方的问题时，我们上周在《纽约时报》的《科学时报》版就再次看到这一点。周二有一篇大文章，标题是《自由意志的力量：现在你有，转眼你就没有》。文章大致综述了当下关于我们是否拥有自由意志的争论。

文章里大多数科学家与受访者的共识是：我们没有。

对我这个年龄的人来说很有意思的是：过去——你知道——现在真正的问题是：我们有自由意志吗？还是我们被进化生物学所决定？这就是当下的议题。

论点是：自然选择决定了我们的一切。

所以我们以为自己在选择爱一个人、或坠入爱河；我们以为是自己在选择，但其实我们是被“硬接线”成那样，为了传递我们的遗传物质，所以我们并没有真正的自由意志。

这就是争论：我们到底有没有自由意志？还是我们被生物学硬性设定？

这很有趣，因为30年前我上大学时，争论是心理学的，不是生物学的。

那时的争论更像弗洛伊德式的：我们有没有自由意志？还是我们完全被潜意识的冲动、过去经历、诸如此类的东西控制？

但在西方所有这些争论中，你总会看到：它不是这样就是那样。不是A就是B。

要么我们有自由意志；要么一切都被决定。或者换句话说：

我们相信：要么我们有自由意志、要为选择负责、选择很重要——这就意味着未来是开放的、不被决定的；要么某种东西已经设定并固定了未来——那我们的选择就不重要。

你看，总是二选一。

但在圣经里，从来不是二选一，永远不是。

从头到尾，无论原则还是实践，圣经总是在说：你是自由的，你要负责，你的选择很重要，你要为你的选择负责，没有人强迫你做那些选择；然而，每一件因这些选择而发生的事，都被神完全按着祂的计划安排并成就。

不只是神预先看见你会做什么；而是你所做的，正好符合祂所要的计划，以及祂要历史走向的路线。

我可以给你很多例子，我只给两个。

先说原则。听听这些箴言，《箴言》16章1节：“心中的谋算在乎人，舌头的应对由于耶和华。”

第9节：“人心筹算自己的道路；惟耶和华指引他的脚步。”

听见了吗？你心里的计划属于你；但你按这些计划所做出的结果，却来自神。

计划属于你；但当你真正说话或行动时，总是与神的计划相契合，总是。

这很惊人。

你看，一方面它说：你的计划、你的选择属于你。它们是你的。不是被强迫的。神不是替你做的。你也不能说“我没办法”。它们是你的。

你是自由的。你要负责。

而结果却总是完全符合神所要的。

你说：这怎么可能？

嗯，那是因为你是西方人，你总觉得只能二选一。为什么非得二选一？

神难道不能吗？难道不可能吗？神既能定意并安排万事，同时又不侵犯你的自由意志？为什么神不能这样做？

我想象不出我怎么能做到。

当然，你想象不出；但你也不够资格来做“神”这份工作。

J. I. 巴刻在他的书《传福音与神的主权》（Evangelism and the Sovereignty of God）里说得很有意思。他说：我们自由意志与责任，和神的主权与对万事的掌管之间的关系，是一个“二律背反”（antinomy）。

他定义说：二律背反不是矛盾，而是“看起来像矛盾”。

他用的例子是光。

我们知道光有时表现得像波，有时表现得像粒子。

它有时表现得好像不具备、好像不由物质构成；有时又表现得好像是。

我们不知道这怎么可能。它不该如此，但它就是如此。

我们不知道它如何运作，但我们知道它确实是这样运作的。

因此我们就按它的方式来处理，否则你就无法理解与使用光。

巴刻说：你看，这显然不是一个真正的矛盾，只是一个表面的矛盾。我们没有足够的知识把它算清楚；这里也是一样。

如果你想看见：一方面神确实在按祂所愿意的方式设定并固定万事；但祂不是在“无视我们的选择”的情况下这样做。

而是“借着”我们的选择来做。我们的选择本身就是祂计划的一部分。

你说：哦，那祂只是知道我们会怎么选。

是的，但还不止如此。你看，你又开始想要二选一了。

不是二选一，是两者兼具。

使徒行传第27章是我最喜欢的圣经例子：保罗和水手、士兵同在一条船上，遭遇可怕的风暴。

在风暴中，人人害怕，水手和士兵都非常恐惧，以为自己要死了。神差遣一个天使对保罗说：船会失事，但不会失去任何一条性命。

于是保罗上到甲板说：神对我说话了。祂说：虽然船会失事，但没有一个人会丧命。

保罗完全相信这话，为什么？

在旧约里，如果你是先知、你发预言，而预言没有应验，先知就要被处死。为什么？因为神的话总是可靠。

如果神真的把话给了你，那它就必须成就。

所以保罗确信：这是神的计划，且毫无疑问不会失去任何一条生命。

但在《使徒行传》27章31节，结果水手决定——风暴仍在继续——水手决定偷偷离船。

他们开始上救生艇。

当保罗看见水手要下船，就告诉士兵拦住他们，并说：“他们若离开船，我们都必死。”

我相信这其实是伟大的陆海军竞争的开端。

不过除此之外，这对我们来说是不是很不合逻辑？

等一下——我们会对保罗说：如果你真的相信没人会死，如果这就是神的计划，那他们下不下船有什么关系？他们上不上救生艇有什么关系？你知道，去浮潜吧，也没事。

因为我们相信：如果未来被固定了，那就是在“无视我们的选择”的情况下被固定的，因此选择不重要。

但你看，保罗有圣经式的理解：我们的选择绝对重要，确实重要；但它们并不决定未来。

因为选择重要，他就不消极；所以他说：我们就该按我们应当做的方式去做事。

但因为选择不决定未来，他也不瘫痪。

他既不消极，也不瘫痪。

2025年即将结束。我们对来年充满盼望，这并不令人意外。

因为神正在做的事——借着福音的教导与资源，引导人归信，并更新基督徒——而你们也帮助我们通过播客、YouTube频道、电台广播、季刊、网站，以及很快将开展的翻译项目来提供这些资源。我们很感恩，有这么多人与我们同工，一起传播基督之爱的讯息。谢谢你们。

这也持续为我们创造机会，扩展分享福音的方式。

现在请听凯勒博士继续今天的信息。

所以，如果你相信一切都被固定了，而且是在无视我们选择的情况下固定的，你就会消极。

如果你相信我们的选择实际上决定未来，那么你就应该瘫痪。

但保罗两者都不是。这非常实用。

你说：“为什么他会瘫痪？我相信我的选择决定未来呀。电影里都是这么说的，《回到未来》也是。我的选择决定未来。”

那你确实应该瘫痪。

为什么？

你知道，有一个很棒的短篇故事，是雷·布拉德伯里写的，你大概没读过。

但你一定见过这种情节——这是一个短篇，叫《雷声》（The Sound of Thunder）。你可能听过它的故事线，因为它被很多《星际迷航》《阴阳魔界》之类的作品反复使用。

《雷声》讲的是一台非法的时间机器。

一个叫特拉维斯的人，收很多钱，会带人坐那台非法的时间机器回到过去，去看历史。

一个叫埃克尔斯的人付钱，要回到过去。

但特拉维斯说：你到了过去要明白，会有一条反重力的金属小径，离地六英寸，不会碰到任何东西。

虽然我们回到过去只是为了看看事情原本怎样，但你绝对不能离开那条路。

你甚至不能碰到一根草叶。

你必须一直走在路上。

埃克尔斯说：为什么？

特拉维斯这样说：假设我们不小心踩死了一只老鼠，只是一只。

这意味着：未来所有由那只老鼠繁衍出来的家族——你一脚下去，你抹杀了十亿种可能的老鼠。全都没了。

那需要那些老鼠才能活下去的狐狸怎么办？每少十只老鼠，就会死一只狐狸。

每少十只狐狸，就会死一头狮子。

最终，有个穴居人出去打猎找食物；可他找不到食物，因为你踩死了那只老鼠。

于是那穴居人在生孩子之前就饿死了；若他活着，他的后代本会有十个儿子。

再往下是十的十倍、一百个儿子，如此延续，十亿个尚未出生的人，就这样在母腹中被扼杀。

罗马不会在七丘之上兴起。

你踩死一只老鼠，就压碎了金字塔。

华盛顿永远不会渡过特拉华河。

不会有美国。

所以他说：留在路上。

永远不要离开。

而且你也知道，埃克尔斯确实离开了路——如果你知道故事的话——他因为太好奇，离开了路，踩死了一只蝴蝶，于是改变了一切。

所以他们回到现在，特拉维斯发现后就把他射杀了，因他做的事。

很精彩的故事，对吧？

这其实是个相当有力量的故事。但你不明白它在说什么吗？

历史中的每一件事，彼此都以百万、近乎无限的方式互相交织、互相扣连。

你往这边或那边一动，就改变一切。

如果这一切真的完全由你来决定，你连一点点都不够。

你没有做出那些选择所需智慧的百万分之一。

你根本不知道它们会引发什么。

你不可能预见所有变化。

而圣经想说的是：你不需要。

你要为你的选择完全负责。你会为它们承担责任。它们是自由的。

没有人强迫你做。

你做出坏选择，会有坏后果。

但未来由神掌管。

神掌管并统管一切。

所以你尽你所能，然后安息。

如果你真相信你的选择决定未来，你就应该瘫痪。若真是那样，自由意志将是最可怕的礼物。

你早晨甚至不该下床。

但事实不是这样。

相反，我们可以确信：万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处，尽管其中极其精密复杂。

我们几乎从不看见“怎么会这样”，但让我给你一个例子。

你知道我们今晚为什么在这里吗？我这周想到这个例子，你一会儿就知道为什么。

我们今晚在这里有许多原因。许多人做了很多事，使这个事工、这间教会得以发生。

但我们当然可以说：如果我和我太太——凯西——大约18年前没有来纽约植堂，我们今天就不会在这里。

为什么？我们来纽约植堂的原因是什么？

因为我们加入了一个长老会宗派；它不仅鼓励，而且给我们自由，并把植堂设为优先事项。

那我们为什么会成为那个长老会宗派的成员？

因为我在神学院最后一年、最后一学期，跟一位教授上了两门课，他说服了我：在神学上我是长老宗的。因此我加入那个宗派；那也是我植堂的原因；也因此我们今天在这里。

那我为什么会去上那两门课？

因为在最后最后的关头，那个人能够来教那两门课。

尽管上面有个官僚程序的障碍，挡着他拿到签证——他是英国人。

他之所以能来教那两门课；它之所以改变了我的神学观点；我之所以加入长老宗；我之所以植堂；我们今晚之所以在这里——全是因为那个官僚障碍在最后一刻突然被打通，他及时赶到来教我那两门课。

那障碍是怎么被打通的？发生了什么？

答案是：有一天早晨，院长在祷告说：“我不知道怎么才能让这位老师赶得及这学期来教课。”

他的祷告伙伴是当时我神学院的一位年轻学生；而他恰好也是当时美国在任总统的儿子之一——那位总统是杰拉尔德·福特。

他是福特的儿子，在那里读书。

当他问院长在为哪些事祷告，院长告诉他之后，他说：“嗯，我认识一个人，你可以去找他谈谈，也许能帮你穿过那个官僚障碍。”

结果真的成了，真的成了。

那他为什么有能力打通那障碍，使那位老师能来，我能上那门课，我能改变观点，我能加入长老会，我能来植堂，我们今晚能在这里？

只因为尼克松辞职了——若不是尼克松辞职，杰拉尔德·福特永远、永远、永远、永远不会当总统。

那尼克松为什么必须辞职？

因为水门事件。

水门事件为什么会发生？

因为有人去窃听民主党办公室，那些人装了窃听器。

但他们装窃听器的那一夜，把门留着没关紧。

因为夜班保安注意到门没扣上，就进去查看，事情因此败露。

差两英寸。

如果那门再关上两英寸，我们今晚就不会在这里。

一切都会改变。

我有一个问题：你觉得那人把门留着不关、而不是把它关上，是偶然的吗？

他只需要拉一下，或者转身说“我还是把门关上吧”，但他没有。

你觉得那是偶然的吗？

当然，布拉德伯里说得对，他是对的：如果那不是偶然，那么没有任何事是偶然。

万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处，就是按祂旨意被召的人。

连水门事件都是为你发生的。

而你知道吗？我们几乎从不得到哪怕百万分之一的百万分之一的百万分之一的瞥见——神如何使万事一同效力，叫爱神的人得益处。

但祂确实在做。

因此你可以确信：无论你里面发生多少糟糕的事，无论你外面发生多少糟糕的事，祂没有离弃你；祂爱你。

现在，我们不仅看见我们可以确信什么、以及我们为何可以确信，最后我们要问：我们如何让这确据在生命中真正起作用？如何？

之所以至少要讲一下，是因为今晚纽约有许多人走来走去，会说：“哦，我相信一位慈爱的神。我相信神无条件爱每一个人。我相信祂无论我做什么都爱我。我相信祂爱我。”

但这并没有改变他们的生命，因为它是抽象的。

“爱”成了一种力量、一种抽象的认知信念，却没有在生活中运作。

那么，这如何改变你的生命？

你必须把它个人化。

你必须从两个方面把它个人化：你必须把神对你的爱个人化；你也必须把这在基督里确据的爱个人化。

首先，如何在你里面把它个人化。

我是什么意思？

我刚给了你一个很好的理性框架——你可以称它为一个小小的智性套路吧。

你如何处理自由意志与神主权之间的事实？

二律背反：看起来矛盾，但不是实际矛盾。我们没有足够知识理解它如何运作，但它就是这样运作。就像光：波与粒子。挺有意思。

这意味着：我们要负责、要做事；同时神完全掌权；等一切结束，万事都按祂的旨意发生。

挺有意思，对吧？这似乎是个不错的智性结构，一种理解方式。

但我要你把它应用到你身上。我要你现在把它个人化。

把它应用到你自己与你和神的关系上。

你与神有关系吗？你是否借着耶稣基督来到神面前？

这里是它如何运作的。

这是个老比喻，但完全真实。

如果你把与神的关系想成一扇门：当你走向那扇门时，门上方写着《马太福音》10:32：“凡在人面前认我的，我在我天上的父面前也必认他。”

“凡”——也就是说，当你走向与神的关系时，你被告知：你必须去做。

你必须做一个决定。

你必须作出委身。

你有事要做。

你不能消极。

但如果你真的这样做了；如果你咬紧牙关说：“主啊，因耶稣所做的接纳我”，你打开那扇门走进去——你一走进去，转过身来看，门上方写着《约翰福音》15:16：“不是你们拣选了我，是我拣选了你们。”

以及《约翰福音》6:44：“若不是差我来的父吸引人，就没有人能到我这里来。”

每一个真正穿过那扇门的人，终有一天会意识到这一点：尽管他付出了所有努力，尽管那委身需要付代价，你甚至可以说需要“流汗”才能作出那个委身。

但你进来之后回头看，会开始说：我之所以成为基督徒，不是因为我比别人更属灵，不是因为我比别人更谦卑，不是因为我比别人更勇敢为真理站立。

而只是因为神一直推动、一直催逼，祂持续、持续地寻求爱我，直到祂把我向祂敞开。

因此，使我成为基督徒的原因，仅仅是：神来找我。

不是因为我更聪明或更好；不是因为我更悔改；不是因为我在任何方面更属灵。

这是白白的，完全白白的。

这是完全出于主权的。

这意味着什么？

我记得我上大学时，听一位牧师讲一段经文，那改变了我的生命。他讲的是《申命记》第7章。

《申命记》7章说：

“耶和华专爱你们、拣选你们，并非因你们的人数多于别民，原来你们的人数在万民中是最少的。只因耶和华爱你们……就用大能的手领你们出了埃及。”

我永远记得那位讲员说：你们看见那里的逻辑了吗？

神说：我不是因为你更伟大才爱你；事实上你更渺小。

我不是因为这个爱你，也不是因为那个爱你；我把你领出埃及，是因为我爱你。

这是一个循环论证：我爱你，只因为我爱你；只因为我爱你。

然后他说——我们都是大学生，没有一个人结婚，但我们仍然听得懂。

他说：把它应用在你配偶身上。

如果你配偶走过来说：“你爱我吗？”你说：“爱。”你的配偶通常会说：“为什么？你为什么爱我？”

他说：千万别说：“嗯，你比别的女生聪明多了。你真好看。你事业前景很好。你太棒了。我们在一起特别开心。”

你看，如果你说“我爱你是因为这个因素或那个因素”，那个人的全部身份就会转移到那个因素上。

因为那个因素成了我价值的根基；那个因素成了我被爱的保障。

但那位牧师说：回答“你为什么爱我？”唯一正确的方式是说：“亲爱的，我爱你，只因为我爱你。”

他说：这不只是软弱的甜言蜜语；这不只是修辞；这不只是甜蜜空话。

他说：爱没有别的运作方式。

当神对你这样说——当神说：我不是因为你更属灵、更道德、更教义正确才爱你；我爱你，只因为我爱你。

而你之所以爱我，也只是因为我一直追着你、追着你、追着你，直到我最终把你向我打开。

这会带来改变；这会改变你的身份。

为什么？

因为终于，我不必聪明，不必老练，不必赚很多钱，不必有趣，不必好看——那些因素都被拿走了。

终于，我被爱是因为我自己。

你看，如果你知道神爱你、或别人爱你、或你配偶爱你，是因为你事业很成功——那你就永远无法承受事业上的逆转。

若是因为你很有才华——你就永远无法承受竞争。

若是因为你“很怎样怎样”——你就永远无法承受失败。

但神那神圣、主权、拣选的恩典——祂爱你，只因为祂爱你——这会改变你。

你把它个人化了吗？

所以你必须先在你身上把它个人化；但第二，你必须在耶稣里把它个人化。

我是什么意思？

有人说：“哦，我相信神爱我，没有什么能使我与神的爱隔绝。哦，我相信。”

但别把爱当成抽象概念；耶稣就是神的爱。

在客西马尼园，在十字架上，你知道发生了什么吗？

宇宙中一切最巨大的力量都列阵来对抗耶稣。

祂本可以阻止它们。

祂本可以阻止拒绝。

祂本可以阻止酷刑。

祂本可以阻止死亡。

祂本可以阻止父的离弃。

祂本可以阻止永恒的公义倾倒在祂头上。

祂只需要做一件事：放弃我们。

就这么一件事。

转身离开。

我想是司布真说过：耶稣基督被钉在十字架上，受钉、流血、死去，俯视着那些背叛祂、离弃祂、否认祂的人。

在宇宙历史中最伟大的爱之行动里，祂留在那里。

一颗又一颗“炸弹”落在耶稣基督身上，试图让祂放开我们、把祂与我们分开。

看到了吗？

连地狱本身都做不到。

祂留在那里。

没有什么能使祂与我们隔绝，也不能使祂的爱与我们隔绝。

祂抓住我们。

祂是我们的救主。

祂为我们而死。

这就是你如何知道：没有什么能使你与神的爱隔绝。

这不是抽象概念。

不要只是说：“哦，我只是相信神无条件爱我。”不。

祂是“逆条件地”爱你——祂是在条件相反时爱你——因为耶稣。

当你看见耶稣基督无论什么临到祂，都不放手，这就是你如何知道。

这也是你唯一真正能绝对确定的方式：无论你里面做了什么，无论外面发生多糟的事，祂没有离弃你。

如果那时祂不离弃你，现在祂也不会离弃你。

如果当地狱本身倾倒在祂身上时祂都不离弃你；如果那都不能使祂的爱与你隔绝——你觉得你过了一个糟糕的一周，就能吗？

你觉得你能做什么，足以摧毁祂对你的爱，而那都不能吗？

或者当坏事在你身上四面发生，你说：“哦，我一定被离弃了。”

如果那时祂不离弃你，现在祂也不会离弃你。

祂不爱惜自己——父不爱惜自己的儿子。

若祂连那都不爱惜，祂赐下了终极的礼物。

你觉得祂现在还会让你的人生脱轨吗？

祂不会拒绝你所需要的任何东西。

如果有人花十亿美元给你买礼物，你觉得他会在包装纸上吝啬吗？

这就是你一生都在寻找的爱。

朋友的爱、婚姻的爱、受欢迎的赞誉、父母的爱，都不能给你这个所能给你的。

《诗篇》27:10说：“我父母离弃我，耶和华必收留我。”

你的父母会离弃你。

即便你有世上最好的父母，他们也会死。

但没有任何事——没有任何事——无论是死，是生，是天使，是掌权的，是有权柄的，是现在的事，是将来的事，是高处的，是低处的，是别的受造之物，都不能叫我们与神的爱隔绝；这爱是在我们的主基督耶稣里的。

你对这一点确定吗？你可以确定。

我们祷告。

父啊，感谢你赐给我们这极大的确据。我们祈求你帮助我们，使它在生命中真实运行。

主也赐我们时间这样做。

当我们把这些具体的元素拿在手中时，求你此刻与我们相遇。

当我们把自己交给你，因为我们知道你把自己交给了我们。我们奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。

今天，提摩太·凯勒探讨：在基督徒的生命里，持久的改变究竟是怎样发生的；以及为什么福音所提供的更新过程，与任何别的东西都截然不同。今晚的经文读自《罗马书》第8章第28节，以及第38、39节：我们知道，爱神的人，就是按他旨意被召的人，万事都互相效力，叫他们得益处。因为我深信：无论是死，是生，是天使，是鬼魔，是现在的事，是将来的事，是有权柄的，是高处的，是低处的，是别的受造之物，都不能叫我们与神的爱隔绝；这爱是在我们的主基督耶稣里。这是神的话。

我们这几周一直在看《罗马书》6、7、8章，我们说这些经文特别是在讲：当耶稣进入你的生命时，他如何具体地改变你的生活。我想做的就是最后再一次，一起来看《罗马书》第8章结尾这一段。它的结尾极其壮丽，但它的要点非常简单。在最后这几节里，保罗说：我在这里要给你一样东西，借着基督它会彻底改变你的生命。而他给我们的，就是一种确据。

他说：这是你每天都可以拿出来使用的东西。这就是会改变你生命的东西。然而，当他表达这份确据时，对我们现代西方文化中的人来说，一个问题就浮现出来。因此，对我们这些活在现代西方文化里的人而言，要不受阻碍地领受、享受并运用这东西，其实很不容易。所以今晚我们要来看这份确据，不过首先，让我先把它读给你听。

让我把最后十二节完整地读给你听。听听他在说什么——其实他只是在说一件事。我用的是一个稍微不同的译本。

我们知道，万事都在一同效力，使那些爱神、按他旨意蒙召的人得着益处。

因为他预先所知道的人，就预定他们效法他儿子的形象。凡他预定的人，他也呼召；凡他呼召的人，他也称义；凡他称义的人，他也使他们得荣耀。那么，我们对这些事该说什么呢？

若神站在我们这边，谁

谁能敌挡我们呢？那既不爱惜自己的儿子，为我们众人舍了，岂不也把万物和他一同白白地赐给我们吗？谁能控告神所拣选的人呢？有神称他们为义了，谁能定他们的罪呢？

基督耶稣已经死了，而且更是复活了，如今在神的右边，也替我们代求。谁能使我们与基督的爱隔绝呢？是患难吗？是困苦吗？是逼迫吗？是饥饿吗？是赤身露体吗？是危险吗？是刀剑吗？不能。

然而，靠着那爱我们的主，在这一切的事上，我们已经得胜有余了。因为我深信：无论是死，是生，是天使，是掌权的，是有能的，是现在的事，是将来的事，是高处的，是深处的，或是受造之物中别的什么，都不能叫我们与神的爱隔绝；这爱是在我们的主基督耶稣里的。这里有一种确据，我想用三个标题来看：我们可以确信什么，我们为什么可以确信，以及我们怎样可以确信——怎样把这份确据不只是当作抽象观念，而是成为我们生命中真正起作用的东西。我们可以确信什么，我们为什么可以确信，我们怎样可以确信。

首先，简要地说，我们可以确信什么——他的要点是什么？他的要点在这里：有一种喜乐是可以得着的。若你拥有它，它就能使你在生命中面对任何事而不至于沉没或崩塌。这喜乐是一种确凿，一种确定性，一种绝对的确定：神不只是现在爱你——当然，是在基督里现在爱你——而且他永远都会爱你。没有任何事能撼动这一点，也没有任何事能把你从这爱中分开，无论发生什么。

宇宙的主不仅现在爱你，也永远都会爱你。这就是确据。而这确据有两个分支。因为一旦你借着耶稣基督与神连接，这确据就有两个分支。第一是——我先把这两个分支直接告诉你：这意味着不管你里面发生了多少糟糕的事，不管你外面发生了多少糟糕的事；不管你里面发生的事有多糟，不管你外面发生的事有多糟，你都可以确信

他仍然爱你。

你看，首先，不管你里面正在发生多糟糕的事，有时候我们会做出一些很糟糕的事。我想让你知道，你心里还有一些你自己还不知道的东西。等它冒出来的时候，你会说：我真不敢相信我竟然能做出那样的事。你会对自己极其失望，会对自己非常生气。那种时候，你会怎么说？

你会说：我做了那样的事之后，神怎么还可能爱我呢？然而保罗是怎么说的呢？他说：“谁能控告神所拣选的人呢？有神称他们为义了。谁能定他们的罪呢？有基督耶稣已经死了，而且复活了，如今在神的右边，也替我们祈求。”

你今天无论做什么，都不可能再把你带回到被定罪的光景里。全都遮盖了，全都付清了，你看。无论你里面发生多少糟糕的事，神都爱你。但其次，我们被告知，确据的另一叉，是：无论你外面正在发生多少糟糕的事，神也爱你。

你看这份清单：患难、困苦、逼迫、饥饿、赤身露体、危险、刀剑。你看，当坏事发生、当一切都不顺的时候，你会觉得：神不爱我，否则他不会让这些事发生。真的很糟糕的事在你里面发生时，你会说：哦，看看我有多么一团糟，神不可能爱我。但当真的很糟糕的事在外面发生时，你会说：看看生活有多么一团糟。

显然，神已经抛弃我了。不可能有一位慈爱的神——然而保罗说：哦，是可以的。无论外面的乱局有多糟，你仍然可以确信，神爱你，因为他在第28节说了什么？他说：“万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处。”这是什么意思呢？

把这些合在一起，从整体、从长远来看。发生的每一件事，每一件事，神都在把它们编织在一起，成为一个为我们的益处、为他的荣耀的计划。这就是经文所说的。而我最喜欢的一个圣经例子，是在一个叫多坍的地方发生的两件事。在《创世记》里，第一件发生在多坍的事，是约瑟被扔进了一个坑里

被他的兄弟们出卖，他就要被卖为奴。

所以，他眼前是一条绝对悲惨的人生之路。他向上帝祷告：“哦，上帝，把我从这里救出去。不要让我被卖为奴。”结果怎样？沉默，沉默。他真的被卖为奴，过了多年多年、年复一年极其痛苦悲惨的生活。然后，许多个世纪之后，在多坍发生的第二件事是：以利沙也在多坍。

那时多坍已是一座城，被敌军围困。他害怕他们会被攻破、被毁灭。以利沙向上帝呼求说：“哦，主啊，求你拯救我们。求你救我们脱离这危险。”这一次，上帝差遣火车火马，击溃入侵的军队，众人得救。但如果你知道约瑟的故事，你就会明白：如果他没有被卖为奴，如果他没有经历那些年复一年的苦难，不但会有数十万人死于饥荒，他自己的家族也会被他们自己的罪所毁灭。

这意味着什么呢？如果你知道这个故事，知道它如何收场，你就会明白：上帝在约瑟的一生中同样积极地使万事互相效力、叫他得益处，正如他在以利沙的经历中所做的一样。上帝在约瑟看似迟缓、没有回应的沉默里，同样积极地工作，正如他在以利沙迅速而轰动的回应里所做的一样。所以保罗说，情况总是如此。

因此，无论你里面发生了多少糟糕的事，无论你外面发生了多少糟糕的事，你都可以确信：上帝绝对地、无误地、毫不改变地爱你。到了最后，保罗在第38、39节作出一个气势磅礴的宣告，这两节经文就印在那里。

在这里，保罗说：“我深信。”他用的是一个表示绝对意向、确定与确信的词。接着他就爆发出来，推动着、伸展着，把语言用到极限，试图说：无论是死是生，无论是天使，是执政掌权的，是天上、是阴间，是高处、是深处，什么都不能。

没有任何事能使你与神在我们主基督耶稣里的爱隔绝，什么都不能。没有任何事能把你从他的爱里撬走，也没有任何事能把他的爱从你身上撬走。

也有人看了这段经文就说：哦，是的，什么都不能使你与神隔绝，可是你自己可以把自己隔绝出去。因为如果你一开始跟随耶稣，后来又转回去，你就会失去救恩，失去祂的爱。所以也许没有什么能使你与神的爱隔绝，但你可以把自己隔绝出去。

这不对。这不是读这段经文的正确方式。我告诉你为什么。你看，经文怎么说？如果你能够转回去，如果你能够把自己从神的爱里分离出来，难道你不也是受造之物的一部分吗？

保罗说，受造界里没有任何东西能使你与神的爱隔绝。你难道不属于受造界吗？照我看，你当然是。保罗要说的是：任何一种可能使你离开神的处境，任何一种可能使你离开神的处境——逼迫、酷刑——这些都不会。

因为爱是如此有能力，它会使你继续面向祂，继续爱祂，使你无论发生什么都在祂的怀抱里。所以你看，这就是你的确据：无论你里面一切邪恶的势力，还是你外面一切邪恶的势力，都不能使你与神的爱隔绝，不能把你从其中撼动，不能把神的爱从你里面撼动出来。一旦你借着基督把自己交给神，祂就是你的，你也属于祂，没有任何事，永远、永远都不能改变这一点——这就是确据。现在，如果我们能就这样继续往下说：那么这在你生命里是怎么运作的？那就太好了。但我们不能。因为正如我说过的，在我们的西方文化里，这样的应许立刻就会引发一个问题。

我之所以说“西方文化”很重要，是因为我们有一个反对意见，真的让我们很困扰——所有这些关于预定、对吧？还有呼召与拣选，神按着祂的计划安排万事——这些让我们不舒服。但别忘了，“我们”是谁：是我们。还有别的世纪、别的文化并不为此困扰；这是一个属于现代西方、浸透启蒙思想、个人主义的人才会有的问题。记住这一点总是有益的：我们所提出的这个重大反对意见，绝不可把任何我们的反对意见绝对化，因为它们总是产生于

这是我们文化的一部分，我们应当认真对待，因为我们就生活在其中。但你知道，我们并不是世界上唯一的文化，因此我们也不该说这就是信靠基督不可逾越的障碍。然而，现代西方人一听到耶稣基督会保守你在他的爱里，以至于无论我们做什么，我们都不会停止爱他，而他也永远不会停止爱我们，他们就会这样说。

并且他完全掌管一切，所以万事都在按着他的计划展开。我们首先想到的就是：那自由意志呢？看，这就是我们的问题。人的责任呢？因为听起来好像上帝是在不顾我们的选择做这一切，仿佛一切要发生的都会发生，即使我们作出不同的选择也一样。

如果真是这样，那谁还在乎你怎么活？谁还在乎你做什么？反正都会发生，你看？你知道，我是基督徒了，所以现在，你知道，也就无所谓了。我什么都不用做，因为他会让我一直爱他，而且一切都在按着他的计划运作。

那这样就真的无所谓了。那么自由意志怎么办？个人责任怎么办？这是个好问题。而且在现代——我刚才说这是一个特别属于西方的问题——我们在上周《纽约时报》的 Science Times 里又被提醒了这一点。星期二有一篇大文章，题目叫《自由意志的力量》。

现在你有它，转眼又没了。那篇文章算是对当下关于我们是否拥有自由意志的争论做了一个概览。而文章里大多数科学家和受访者的共识是：我们没有。对我这个年纪的人来说，这很耐人寻味——有意思的是，过去你知道，真正的问题是：我们有自由意志吗？还是我们被进化生物学所决定？现在争论的焦点就是这个。

你看，他们的论证是：自然选择决定了我们的一切。所以我们以为自己是在选择去爱某个人，或爱上某个人。我们以为自己在选择，但其实我们是被“硬连线”成那样，为了传递我们的遗传物质，所以我们就不

真的拥有自由意志。所以争论就在这里：我们到底有没有自由意志，还是说我们被自己的生物学所“硬接线”所决定？

很有意思，因为三十年前我上大学的时候，这个争论是心理学层面的，不是生物学层面的。那时的争论更像是弗洛伊德式的：我们有没有自由意志，还是我们完全被潜意识的冲动、过去的经历或诸如此类的东西所控制？但你在西方所有这些辩论里总会看到的一点是：非此即彼，非此即彼。要么我们真的有自由意志，要么一切都被决定了；或者换一种说法：我们相信，要么我们有自由意志、要为自己的选择负责、我们的选择确实重要——这意味着未来是开放的、未被决定的；要么有什么东西已经设定并固定了未来——那样我们的选择就不重要了。看见了吗？就是非此即彼。但在圣经里，从来不是非此即彼，从来不是。

从头到尾，无论在原则上还是在实践上，总是这样：你是自由的，你要负责，你的选择重要，你要为自己的选择负责，没有人强迫你做那些选择；然而，你这些选择所带来的一切结果，每一件发生的事，都被安排、正按照上帝的计划精确地运行。并不只是上帝预先看见你将要做什么；而是你所做的，恰好契合祂所要的计划，以及祂希望历史走向的轨道。我可以给你很多例子，我就先给你两个。首先是原则：听这些箴言，这是《箴言》16章1节：“心中的谋算在乎人；舌头的应对由于耶和华。”

还有第9节：“人心筹算自己的道路；惟耶和华指引他的脚步。”听到了吗？你心里的计划属于你，但你按着计划实际做出来的事却出于上帝。你的计划属于你，但当你真正开口说话或采取行动时，那总是与上帝的计划相契合，总是如此。现在，这真令人震惊。

你看，一方面它说，你的计划、你的选择属于你。它们是你的。它们不是被强迫的。上帝不是替你去做，而你

我不能说我是不由自主的。它们是你自己的。

你是自由的。你要负责。结果永远都恰恰是上帝所要的。你说，这怎么可能？嗯，那是因为你是西方人，你总觉得非此即彼，为什么一定要非此即彼呢？

上帝难道不行吗？难道不可能吗？上帝完全可以把事情安排好、把一切都处理妥当，同时又不侵犯你的自由意志。上帝为什么不能这么做？我想象不出我怎么能做到。

不，你当然想象不出；但你并不够资格胜任上帝这份工作。杰克·帕克在他的书《传福音与上帝的主权》中把这一点讲得很精彩。他说，我们的自由意志与责任，和上帝的主权以及对万事的掌管之间的关系，是一种“二律背反”。他所定义的“二律背反”，并不是自相矛盾，而是一种表面的矛盾。

他用来举例的是光。我们知道，光有时表现得像波，有时又表现得像粒子。因为它的行为好像它并不拥有——好像它并不由物质构成；可有时它又表现得好像它是由物质构成的。我们不知道这怎么可能。按理说不该这样，但事实就是这样。

我们不知道这是怎么运作的，但我们知道它确实就是这样运作的。因此我们就按它这样来处理；不然你就不知道该如何对待光。杰克·帕克说，你看，这显然不是实际的矛盾，只是表面的矛盾。我们没有足够的知识把它弄明白；这里也是一样。如果你想明白：一方面，我们绝对——上帝绝对在按他所愿意的方式设定并安排一切；但他并不是不顾我们的选择而这样做。

相反，是借着这些选择，我们的选择本身就是他计划的一部分。你会说，哦，所以他只是知道我们会怎么选。是的，但不止于此。你看，你又来了，你想把它弄成非此即彼。

不，是两者都是真的。两者都包括。在《使徒行传》第27章，这是我在圣经里最喜欢的一个例子：保罗在一条船上，和水手、士兵一起遭遇一场可怕的风暴，可怕的风暴。在风暴当中，人人都害怕，水手和士兵真的很害怕自己会死，上帝派一位天使对保罗说，这船会失事，但不会有一个生命

就会被扔进海里。所以保罗走到甲板上说：神已经对我说话了。

他说，尽管这艘船会失事，但没有一个人会丧命。保罗为什么相信这一点？你知道吗？在旧约里，如果你是先知，作了预言，而那预言没有应验，先知就要被处死，你知道为什么吗？因为神的话永远可靠。若真是祂把神的话赐给你，那就一定会成就。

因此，保罗完全确信这是神的计划，也绝对确定不会有任何生命失去。可是在《使徒行传》27章31节，事情却是：水手们决定——你知道，风暴还在继续——水手们决定要偷偷离船。他们开始上救生艇。保罗看见水手想要离船，就告诉士兵拦住他们，并说：如果他们离开这船，我们都会死。我相信这其实就是陆军和海军伟大竞争关系的开端。

不过除此之外，这对我们来说不是很不合逻辑吗？等一下，我们会对保罗说：你看，如果你真的相信不会有人丧命，如果事实就是如此，如果这就是神的计划，那他们下不下船又有什么关系？他们上不上救生艇又有什么关系？你知道，去浮潜也没事。因为你看，我们以为：如果是定了的，那就是不管我们怎么选择都定了，所以选择并不重要。可你看，保罗不是这样。

保罗对这事有合乎圣经的理解。我们的选择很重要，绝对重要，但它们并不决定未来。正因为选择重要，他不是消极被动；所以他说：我们要按我们该做的方式去做事。但因为选择并不决定未来，他也不会被吓得动弹不得。

他既不被动，也不瘫住。这个2025年即将结束。我们对来年充满盼望，这不该令人惊讶。因为神正在做工，借着你帮助我们在播客、YouTube频道、广播节目、季刊杂志和网站上提供的福音教导与资源，使人归信，也更新基督徒的生命，并且很快也将通过我们的

translation project，我们感谢你们当中有这么多人与我们同工，一起传扬基督之爱的讯息。谢谢你们。

这也持续为我们带来机会，拓展分享福音的方式。到 2026 年，我们预计将新增国际电台广播，并增加线上事工合作伙伴关系，出版新书，并开始让凯勒博士的讲道以其他语言提供。因此，在年末之际，我们邀请你们在祷告中认真考虑，向“福音在生命中”（Gospel in Life）作一份年终奉献。我们所收到的年终奉献，是我们为 2026 年事工预备的重要一环。

你们的支持使我们能够把福音的故事分享给 200 多个国家的人，我们也为你们参与这项使命深深感恩。若要作年终奉献，请访问 gospelonlife.com-giv，也就是 gospelonlife.com-giv。也请为我们祷告，愿我们能善用你们的奉献，并且借着“福音在生命中”的事工，许多新的人会因认识基督为救主而找到盼望与喜乐。谢谢你们与我们同工，把基督的爱分享给一个需要祂的世界，因为福音确实改变一切。现在请听凯勒博士继续今天信息的其余部分。

所以，如果你相信尽管我们做出选择，一切都已经被定死了，你就会变得消极被动。如果你相信我们的选择真的决定了未来，那么你就应该被吓得动弹不得。但他两者都不是。这一点非常实际。

你会说，嗯，他为什么会动弹不得呢？我相信我的选择决定未来，你知道吗？所有电影都这么说，《回到未来》之类的。所以，我的选择决定未来。嗯，你就应该被吓得动不了。

原因在这里。你知道，有一个很棒的故事——雷·布拉德伯里写的一篇短篇小说——你大概从没读过。但你肯定见过类似的情节；这篇短篇叫《雷鸣之声》（The Sound of Thunder）。不过你可能听过它的故事线，因为多年来它被用在许多《星际迷航》、 《阴阳魔界》之类的作品里。《雷鸣之声》讲的是一台非法的时光机。

有个叫特拉维斯（Travis）的人，收取一大笔钱，就会用那台非法时光机带人回到过去去看历史。而有一个人名叫

埃克尔斯来付钱，好回到时间机器里。但特拉维斯说：现在，当你进入过去时，我要你明白，会有一条反重力金属小路。它会离地六英寸，不会碰到任何东西。尽管我们回到过去是为了看看事情原本怎样，你也绝不能离开这条路。

你甚至连一根草叶都不能碰。你必须待在路上。埃克尔斯说，为什么？特拉维斯是这么说的：他说，我们假设我们不小心踩死了一只老鼠，就一只，因为你一脚踩上去。

那就意味着，未来所有的家族都是那只老鼠的家族的家族——因为你那一脚。你毁掉了十亿种可能存在的老鼠。它们全都没了。那需要这些老鼠才能活下去的狐狸怎么办？每少十只老鼠，就会死一只狐狸。

每少十只狐狸，就会死一头狮子。最终，某个穴居人出去打猎找食物。但没有食物了，因为你把它踩死了。于是那个穴居人在还没来得及生儿育女之前就饿死了；本来从他的腰身会生出十个儿子。再从他们的腰身，十个、一百个儿子，如此继续下去，十亿人——尚未出生的——就在子宫里被扼杀了。

罗马不会在七丘之上崛起。踩死一只老鼠，你就压碎了金字塔。华盛顿不会横渡特拉华河。根本不会有美国。所以他说，留在路上。

绝不要迈出路外。顺便说一句，你也知道，埃克尔斯确实迈出去了——也许你知道这个故事——他因为太好奇而离开小路，踩死了一只蝴蝶，结果一切都变了。所以当他们回来、特拉维斯意识到他做了什么时，就开枪打死了他。很精彩的故事，对吧？这确实是个相当有力的故事，但你难道不明白它在说什么吗？

历史上的每一件事、每一件事，都以无数、近乎无限的方式彼此扣连、交织；任何一点点改变都是如此。你往这边或那边走，都会改变一切。而如果这一切真的完全由你来决定，你连最轻微的一点都做不到。你没有哪怕百万分之一的智慧去做那些选择。你根本不知道它们预先牵动了哪些事情。

你不可能预料所有这些变化。而圣经想要

也就是说，你不必那样。你对自己的选择负完全的责任。你要为它们承担责任。它们是自由作出的。

没有人强迫你去做。如果你做了糟糕的选择，就会有糟糕的后果。但上帝掌管着未来。上帝在统管、并且在推翻并驾驭一切。所以你可以尽你所能，然后就放松。

如果你真的相信你的选择决定未来，你就应该会被吓得动弹不得——那就是所谓的自由意志。要真是那样，那将是最可怕的礼物。你早晨甚至不该从床上起来。但事实并非如此。

相反，我们可以确信的是：万事都互相效力，叫爱上帝的人得益处，尽管其中的安排非常复杂。我们几乎从来都看不出它是怎么做到的，但让我给你一个例子。你知道我们今晚为什么会在这里吗？这周我一直在想这个例子，你一会儿就会明白为什么。我今晚会在这里。

原因有很多。各式各样的人做了许多事，才使这项事工和这间教会得以发生。但我们当然可以说：如果我和我妻子——凯西和我——大概18年前没有来到纽约开始这间教会，这一切就不会在这里。不会的。这里的一切都不会存在。

那么，为什么呢？我们来纽约植堂的原因是什么？因为我们加入了一个长老会宗派：它不仅鼓励我们，还给了我们自由，并且把植堂设为优先事项。那我们为什么会成为那个长老会宗派的成员呢？因为我在神学院最后一年、最后一个学期，跟一位教授上了两门课，他使我确信：在神学立场上我是一名长老会信徒；因此我进入了那个宗派，因此我去植堂。

可我为什么会选那两门课呢？因为就在最后、最后一刻，这个人能够来教那两门课。尽管上头有个官僚程序的卡点一直让他拿不到签证——他是英国人。于是，他之所以能来教那两门课；之所以改变了我的神学观点；之所以我加入了长老会宗派；之所以他被栽种了教会，而且……

我们今晚之所以会在这里，唯一的原因，是因为那个官僚程序上的卡点在最后一刻突然被打通了，他才能及时赶到那里，去教我那些课程。那么，是什么把他的卡点打开了呢？

发生了什么？答案是：有一天早晨，院长在祷告，说：“我不知道我们要怎样才能让这个人赶得及来教他这学期的课程。”他的祷告同伴是个年轻人，当时是我神学院的学生；而且他碰巧还是当时美国现任总统的儿子之一——那位总统是杰拉尔德·福特。他是福特的一个儿子，也是那里的学生。当他问院长在为什么祷告，院长告诉了他，他就说：“嗯，你知道，我有个人名你可以去找他谈谈，可能能帮你跨过那个官僚程序的卡点。”结果真的成了，真的成了。

那么，为什么他有能力把那件事打通、把那个卡点清除掉，让那个人能来、让我能上那门课、让我能改变我的观点、让我能加入长老会、让我能来并建立这间教会、于是我们今晚才能在这里？因为只有在尼克松辞职之后才会这样；除非尼克松辞职，否则杰拉尔德·福特永远、永远、永远、永远都不可能当总统。但尼克松为什么必须辞职？因为水门事件。那水门事件为什么会发生？

因为那些去窃听民主党办公室的人——就是那些家伙干的。但他们窃听的那天晚上，他们把门留开了。而且因为一名夜班看守注意到门闩没有扣上，他就进去查看，于是一切都被发现了。差两英寸。要是那扇门再关上两英寸，我们今晚就不会在这里。

一切都会改变。我有个问题：你觉得那件事是偶然发生的吗——那个人把门留开而不是关上？他只要拉一下，或者转过身说“门关上了”，他却没有。你觉得那是偶然发生的吗？

当然，雷·布拉德伯里的说法是对的，他是对的。如果那不是偶然发生的，那么就没有任何事是偶然发生的。万事都互相效力，叫爱神、按他旨意被召的人得益处。甚至

水门事件是为你发生的。你知道吗？

雷·塞尔登，我们是否哪怕得到十亿分之一的十亿分之一的十亿分之一的瞥见，看见上帝如何使万事互相效力，叫爱上帝的人得益处？但他正在这样做。因此你可以确信：无论你里面正在发生多少糟糕的事，无论你外面正在发生多少糟糕的事，他都没有离弃你，他爱你。现在，当你不仅看见我们可以确信，而且明白我们为什么可以确信，最后，我们怎样才能把这真正落实在我们的生活里？怎么做？

我们至少得花一点点时间谈这个原因是：今晚在纽约有很多人走来走去，说：“哦，我相信一位有爱的上帝。我相信上帝无条件地爱每一个人。我相信无论我做什么，他都爱我，我相信他爱我。”但这并没有改变他们的生活，因为那是抽象的。爱成了一种力量，成了一种抽象的认知信念，没有起作用；而你的人生——以下就是它如何能改变你的人生。

你必须把它个人化。你必须从两方面把它个人化。你要把上帝在你里面的爱个人化，也要把这里在基督里这份确定无疑的上帝之爱个人化。首先，怎样把它在你里面个人化。现在，我所说的是这个。

我刚刚给了你一个很棒的小小智性套式——我想你可以这么称呼它。你如何处理自由意志与上帝主权的事实？嗯，这是二律背反，是表面上的矛盾，不是真正的矛盾。我们没有足够的知识去明白它如何运作，但它就是那样运作。就像光——既是波又是粒子——那样有趣。

这意味着我们是有责任的，我们必须去做事；同时，上帝又完全掌权；等一切结束时，所有发生的事都照着他的旨意发生。是不是很有意思？这是一种不错的智性结构，你知道的，一种理解方式。但我希望你把它应用到你身上。我希望你现在就把它个人化。

我希望你把它应用到你自己，以及你与上帝的关系上。你与上帝有关系吗？你有没有借着耶稣基督来到上帝面前？现在它是这样运作的。而这

这是个老例子，但完全正确。

如果你把与上帝的关系想象成一扇门：当你走近那扇门时，在门的上方你看见写着：马太福音10:32——“凡在人面前认我的，我在我天上的父面前也必认他。”凡……都可以。换句话说，当你走近与上帝的关系时，别人告诉你的是：你必须去做。你必须做出决定。

你必须作出委身。你有事情要做。你不能被动。但如果你真的这么做了，如果你回应了，如果你说：“主啊，因着耶稣所做的，求你接纳我。”你真的打开那扇门，走进去——你一走进去，立刻转过身来看，门的上方写着：约翰福音15:16——“不是你们拣选了我，是我拣选了你们。”还有约翰福音6:44——“若不是差我来的父吸引人，就没有人能到我这里来。”

每一个真正穿过那扇门的人，到了某个时候都会意识到这一点：尽管他们付出了所有努力，尽管作出那份委身需要很大的决心，尽管你可以说，为了作出那承诺你流了很多汗；可当你进来之后，你开始回头看，会说：我之所以成为基督徒，不是因为我比别人更属灵，不是因为我比别人更谦卑，不是因为我比别人更勇敢地为真理站立。

只是因为上帝一直在推动、在催逼；他不断地、不断地寻求来爱我，直到他把我向他敞开。因此，使我成为基督徒的原因很简单：是上帝来找我，不是因为我更聪明或更好，不是因为我更悔改，不是因为我在任何方面更属灵；这是白白的，完全白白的。这是完全主权的。

那么这意味着什么？我记得我上大学的时候，听到一位牧师用一段经文讲道，改变了我的一生。他讲的是申命记第7章。申命记7章是这样说的：

“耶和华并不是因你们人多，就喜悦你们、拣选你们；原来你们的人数在万民中是最少的。只因耶和华爱你们，就用大能的手领你们出了埃及。”

我永远忘不了那位讲员说：“你看见这里的逻辑了吗？”

它说：

上帝说：我爱你，并不是因为你更强大；其实你反而更弱小。我爱你不是因为这个，我爱你不是因为那个；我把你从埃及领出来，是因为我爱你。这是一个循环论证。我爱你，就因为我爱你，就因为我爱你。然后他又说——当时我们全都是大学生，没有一个人结婚——但我们都能明白。

他说：把这应用到你的配偶身上。如果你的配偶走到你面前说：“你爱我吗？”你说：“爱。”你的配偶通常会说：“为什么？你为什么爱我？”

他说：千万别说，“嗯，你比其他女孩聪明多了。你真好看。你的职业前景很棒。你就是……我们在一起特别开心。”你看，如果你说：“我爱你是因为这个因素、那个因素、这个因素、那个因素”，那个人的整个身份就会转移到那个因素上。

因为那个因素成了我价值的基础；那个因素成了让我被爱、让我爱得稳固的东西。但那位牧师说，回答“你为什么爱我？”这个问题的唯一方式是说：“亲爱的，我爱你，就因为我爱你。”他说，这不只是软弱的话，这不只是修辞，这不只是甜言蜜语。他说，爱没有别的运作方式。而当上帝对你这么说——当上帝说：“我不爱你不是因为你更属灵、更道德、更在教义上更正确；我爱你，就因为我爱你。”

而你爱我也只是因为我一次又一次地追着你、追着你、追着你，直到最后我把你击碎、把你打开。那就改变了——那就改变了你的身份，为什么？因为终于，我不必聪明，我不必老练，我不必赚很多钱，我不必有趣，我不必好看；那些因素都被拿走了。终于，我是因我自己而被爱。你看，如果你知道上帝爱你、别人爱你、你的配偶爱你、任何人爱你，是因为你有一份很棒的事业，你就永远无法承受那份事业的逆转。

或者因为你很有才华，你就永远无法承受竞争。或者因为你在某方面很……

你将永远无法承受失败。但神的神圣主权和拣选的恩典，他爱你，只因为他爱你。这会改变你。那个人，你把它个人化了吗？

所以你必须为自己把它个人化，但其次，你还必须在耶稣里把它个人化。我这是什么意思呢？人们说，哦，我相信神爱我，没有什么能使我与神的爱隔绝。哦，我相信，但不要抽象地思考爱，耶稣就是神的爱。在客西马尼园和十字架上，你知道发生了什么吗？

宇宙中所有最强大的力量都列阵反对耶稣。而他本可以阻止它们。他本可以阻止被拒绝。他本可以阻止酷刑。他本可以阻止死亡。

他本可以阻止父的拒绝。他本可以阻止永恒的公义降临在他头上。他要做的只是放弃我们。这就是他要做的全部。只需走开。

我想是司布真说的，耶稣基督在十字架上，被钉着，流血，垂死，俯视着那些背叛他、离弃他、否认他的人。在宇宙历史上最伟大的爱之行动中，他留下了。一颗又一颗炸弹降临在耶稣基督身上，试图让他放弃我们，使他与我们分离。看到了吗？甚至地狱本身也做不到。

他留下了。没有什么能使他与我们分离。他对我们的爱。他抓住我们不放。他是我们的救主。

他为我们而死。现在，这就是你如何知道没有什么能使你与神的爱隔绝。这不是抽象的。只是说，哦，我只是相信神无条件地爱我。哦，不。

他逆条件地爱你。他违背条件爱你，因为耶稣的缘故。当你看到耶稣基督无论什么降临在他身上都从未放开你，这就是你如何知道的。而且这是你真正绝对确信的唯一方式——无论你内在做了什么，无论外在发生了什么糟糕的事，他都没有抛弃你。如果他那时不会抛弃你，他现在也不会抛弃你。

如果当地狱本身降临在他身上时他都不会抛弃你。如果那都没有使他的爱与你分离，

你认为你度过糟糕的一周就能做到吗?你认为有什么事情是你能做的,能摧毁他对你的爱,而那都做不到的吗?或者当坏事接连发生在你身上时,你说,哦,我一定是被抛弃了。如果他在那时都没有抛弃你,他现在也不会抛弃你。

他没有吝惜自己。天父没有吝惜他自己的儿子。如果他没有吝惜那个,如果他没有吝惜那个,他就给了我们最终极的礼物。你认为他会以某种方式让你的生命现在偏离轨道吗?他不会拒绝给你任何你需要的东西。

如果有人花十亿美元买你的礼物,你认为他会在包装纸上吝啬吗?这就是你一生都在寻找的爱。没有朋友的爱,没有婚姻的爱,没有大众的赞誉,没有父母的爱能给你这个所能给你的。诗篇27篇10节说,虽然我的父母离弃我,耶和华必收留我。你的父母会离弃你。

即使你拥有世界上最好的父母,他们也会死去。但是,没有什么,没有什么,无论是死、是生、是天使、是掌权的、是有能的、是现在的事、是将来的事、是高处的、是低处的,还是别的受造之物,都不能叫我们与神的爱隔绝,这爱是在我们的主基督耶稣里的。你确信这一点吗?你可以确信。让我们祷告。

天父,感谢你赐给我们这个巨大的确据。我们祈求你帮助我们让它在我们的生命中运作起来。愿主让这成为实现的时刻。当我们把这些具体的物质拿在手中时,请与我们相遇。当我们把自己献给你,因为我们知道你已经把自己献给了我们,我们奉耶稣的名祷告,阿们。
