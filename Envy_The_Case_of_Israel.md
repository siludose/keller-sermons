### Introduction: The Problem of Envy

Some people say the fundamental problem of the world is poverty. Others say it's bad systems, poor education, or biology, but what if none of these can fully explain the brokenness we see, both in the headlines and in our own hearts? In today's teaching, Tim Keller looks at how the Bible's teaching on sin gives us a deeply honest and yet incredibly hopeful view of the world.

The teaching this morning is based on a text that is printed in the bulletin. It's a brief text. Just give you a little background when we print such a brief text. It's Numbers, Chapter 11, verses 4-6. This happens in the midst of a fairly long narrative that many of you are familiar with the broad contours of Israel, the Israelites, were the slave labor force of Egypt. They were in Egypt and they helped build under the lash the great pyramids and many of the great works of architecture in ancient Egypt. But they were slaves. They were cruelly oppressed. They were beaten. They were killed. When they got too numerous, many of their children were slaughtered. It was a terrible situation.

But God through Moses led them out through miraculous signs, passed through the Red Sea. But on their way to Canaan, on their way to their promised land, they had to go through a wilderness of desert. And in the desert there was no food at all, no food at all. God made a provision for them. And it was called Manna. And Manna was a very odd phenomenon. It came down with the dew. We were told every morning, six mornings of the week, not the last morning. And it lay on the ground, and we're told it looked like coriander seed and it looked like resin. It was light. It could be made into cakes. It was the only thing they had to eat. But it's what they were able to sustain themselves with.

> "The rabble with them began to crave other food. And again, the Israelites started wailing and said, if only we had meat to eat. We remember the fish we had in Egypt at no cost. Also the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic. But now we've lost our appetite. We never see anything but this Manna."

**This is God's word.**

### The Symptom of Envy

Never before have people been more willing to admit that humankind is sick. There's something. There's a sickness in us. We are cruel to each other. We visit each other with cruelty in ways that we cannot seem to heal. We have an inveterate kind of unhappiness in our hearts that we can't seem to put out.

For the last 100 years, I would say the ruling western understanding of why we are so cruel and why we are so unhappy, the reigning understanding has been that it's an environmental thing. That it comes from that which is from outside of us. That it comes from conditions. But now in the last few decades, especially the last 10 years or so, increasingly the intelligentsia, the smart people, the philosophers, the thinkers have been increasingly willing to admit that there's something deeper than that.

They might actually be beginning to say it could be that Shakespeare was right when he said the fault of your Brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that there's something in us. And the Bible, of course, for centuries has been saying that the problem with human beings is not environmental, it's essential that there is a poison in us. It's called sin. And that poison, as Dorothy Sayers, remember we refer to this a few weeks ago, Dorothy Sayers described, defined it sin as a deep interior dislocation of the soul.

And this poison, poisons us so deeply, and there are symptoms of poison. When you take poison before you actually finally die, symptoms, your symptoms. And if you want to understand whether you're poisoned or not, you have to understand the symptoms. And you will never understand your own life, you will never understand society, you will never understand human beings, you will never understand life unless you understand the symptoms of sin.

And I think in this series we've been looking at various ways in which the poison of sin distorts our lives. And it's a very hopeful series, I think, because you see, only if you understand these symptoms, only if you understand the nature of them and the source of them will you understand the antidote for them.

So today, let's just take a look at one more major symptom of the poison of sin. Let's look at the symptom and the root cause and the antidote for it. The symptom, the root cause and the antidote, and the symptom is envy.

We see it here in this story about the children of Israel and the wilderness. And right away, I know that the word envy doesn't mean a lot to you, it doesn't fill you with fear and shaking, because we tend to define envy in a very narrow way. We think of envy as just jealousy, very conscious jealousy of somebody else's money or something like that. I'd like to show you that the Bible teaches us that envy is far more pervasive than that, if far more destructive than that, far more deep and dangerous than that.

The problem that these people had, the rabble with them began to crave other food, and again the Israelites started wailing and said, if only we had meat to eat. We remember the fish we had in Egypt at no cost and the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions and the garlic. Now in verse six, if you look at this, I like the new international version of the Bible at translation that we usually print in the bulletin, and it's still my favorite version, and I'm happy to recommend it. This is one of those few times when I have to say the translation here is most unfortunate. Literally they say, our souls are dried up. Now this is a very free rendering and an unfortunate one. Literally our souls, and the Hebrew word for soul that they use here, Nephese is the word that means their life force, you know what they're saying? Our souls are dried up. It says, we are dying because we have nothing but this man up. We are dying. We're feeling faint. We're feeling sick. This isn't enough to sustain us. Our souls are dried up.

Now what are they talking about? It's something fairly simple. Envy is a condition that deeply poisons us, that makes us unable to enjoy what's in front of us ever. Unable to ever sit down and live in the moment and rejoice in what we have, but to find fault with it and to say this isn't enough. This isn't good enough. Envy is that cast of mine, sometimes it's stronger, sometimes it's weaker. It's stronger in some people than others. It's stronger. It's sometimes in your life than others. But it's there because we're all sinners, we're all poisoned with this. Envy is that thing which keeps us from being able to sit down with that which is in front of us and enjoy it. We find out what's wrong. It's not good enough.

In other words, envy is that condition of heart that says, back there, over there, out there I could be happy, but what I've got right now, it's not good enough. Look at the flaws. Look what's wrong with it. See, over there if I had that condition, if I had that situation I could be happy. Back there, I could be happy if it was like it used to be, out there. If only things could happen in this way, but right now the way it is right now, it's not good enough.

See, look at the Israelites. This is funny, I guess. When they were in Egypt, they said, yes, we have lots of food, and it's free, of course, there are slaves that didn't pay any money for it. And it came, the fish and the leeks and the lemons and the melons and all that. Well, it was free, but when they were there they said, but what good is all this free food, when you're not free. But now they're free, and what are they saying? What good is our freedom, if we're going to starve? When they were back there, out there I can be happy, but right now this isn't good enough. When they were out there, back there I could have been happy, but right now it's not good enough.

I'll make you laugh some more. There's some people who think that New Yorkers have more of a problem with this than most anybody else. There's a theory. Anybody read the couple of weeks ago, New York Times Magazine, an article by John Tierney called Picky, Picky, Picky, do you see that? He says that New Yorkers in particular have what he calls the internal flawomatic. Now, flawomatic is that, which focuses on the flaws, focuses on the faults, focuses on what's wrong, so we say, I hate this, this is not good enough. Now we use it on restaurants, we use it on art, we use it on our friends, we use it on our career, but he says, we go absolutely crazy when we use it on dates, when we use it on people, we're thinking about dating or we're sizing up as a prospective date or a mate or a companion.

And he puts it this way, he says, for example, he recounts one New Yorker talking to another New Yorker that he heard this, about a blind date that he had. He says, well, he says it's start out great, she opened the door, and she looked fantastic. Beautiful face, great body, nice smile, everything looked great, until she turned around, Chuck he said, she had dirty elbows. And that was that, the guy went through with the rest of the date, but he knew the relationship possibilities were absolutely doomed. At first I thought, you know, there's some way maybe to work this out, some therapy, some soap and water, but then I realized it wouldn't matter, he'd find something else wrong.

This is continuing to quote, it was like what I'd been hearing from my friends in New York for years and about why the latest relationships had gone wrong. One said to me, well, she's really seemed intelligent, but then she mispronounced Gerta. And I knew she was faking it. Another said, there's no future for us, it's obvious to everybody that she should lose about seven pounds, but she doesn't seem to notice. Everyone said, oh, sure, he's a partner, but it's not a very big firm, and besides that he wears these little short black socks that make his legs show when he crosses his legs. For years I knew my own requirements and a woman were absolutely reasonable, all I wanted was a nice novelist slash astronaut with a background in fashion modeling, but I couldn't see, I could see that all my other friends were much, much too picky, picky, picky.

Now you laugh, my friends, a headache might be a symptom of just having no driven without your sunglasses, you know, or it might be a symptom of a brain tumor. It might be something very light and passing or it might be something very deep. And the Bible says that yeah, maybe in New Yorkers, it's worse. In fact, Tierney actually says something, I think very, very powerful and right. He says, why are we like this? Why are we worse than other places? Why do we do this to ourselves? Why do we do this to people? Why this cosmic, phlegmatic? And he says maybe New York drives inhabitants crazy, maybe close encounters with wealth and glamour distort our vision. But all he's saying is it's worse here.

See, the Bible says this is not a symptom of driving without sunglasses. This is a symptom of a cancer that's eating away at your insides. It's a cancer that's eating away totally at your insides. This is very powerful. He says our vision is distorted, says the author. That's right. Look at this. They say our souls are dried up, okay? They say our souls are dried up. We had it better in Egypt. Now look, you see the distortion? They are so focused on the flaws. They are so focused on what's wrong. They're so focused on this. They're completely distorted in their memory. How can they... We had it better in Egypt. It was free. The food was free. Of course the food was free. You were in chains. How could you overlook the slaughter of your children? But we had it better in Egypt. How could they be so distorted? The writer is right. There's something in us. There's a cosmic phlegmatic. It's going crazy here. We hate this stuff. We hate our situation. It's not good enough. We had it better.

Let me show you just how powerful it is. The ultimate example of it. Is the Garden of Eden. Here's Adam and Eve. They're there to show you yourself. Here's Adam and Eve. And they're in paradise. And it's a perfect place. There's no death. There's no disease. There's nothing wrong. Everything is perfect. And yet through the serpent, the thought comes to them. Are you able to do anything you want? No, they say not anything. We're not allowed to eat that tree. Anything else. We can do anything else. We can eat anything else, but not that tree. And here comes the thought back. How bad it's the best one. I'll bet it's better than all the other trees put together. And they were unsatisfied. And they felt I can think of a better situation than the Garden of Eden.

What do you think this means? Listen, I don't care on how unhappy you are right now with your circumstances. If you understand what the Bible is telling you, it is telling you that if you were to pick yourself up and put yourself down in the Garden of Eden with your heart in the same sinful condition as in now, you'd find something wrong with that. That's what sin does. It makes you look for the fault. It makes you look for the flaw. It makes you reject it. It makes you... Nothing is good enough. Nothing is good enough. And so you're miserable. And you think about it like that.

So, this is the reason why some of us never get married or when you do get married, you're always unhappy with the one you're married to. This is the reason some of us are so driven in our career because we hate the wrong on the latter we're at. This is the reason some of you can't stand the way you look in the mirror. This is the reason why many of us have such critical spirits toward other people. This is the reason why some of you can never join a church. Picky, picky, picky. And of course you're going to find it. This is the reason why you're constantly having mid-life crises. And you're only in your early 20s. Ah, because, you know, I just need a change. I don't like the way I am out there, back there. It's poisoning your life. You can never sit down and enjoy what's in front of you. You can never sit back and just receive what you've got. To one degree and another, we're all suffering from it. That's the symptom.

### The Root Cause of Envy

Well, you say, well, what's the root of it? I can sort of see why this is kind of making my life a gray thing, a gray situation. This kind of unhappy, always kind of gray and irritated and itchy and irritable and unhappy and critical of everybody and everything around. What's the root of it? Well, the root of it is the particular poison, but here's what the particular poison is. You don't trust God further than you can throw him. You can't throw God even an inch.

At the heart of why we are continually unhappy with everything and why we can never enjoy anything and why we're always miserable to one degree and other and never able to... I mean, things are great at first, but then they wear, huh? They don't wear out. You say, I want something new. I want something better. I want something... The reason for it, the Bible says, is the ultimate poison is you don't trust God. You don't trust Him. You don't see His trust worthy. And if anybody here says that's not true of me, you don't know your own heart.

There's not a lot of things that I'm sure of. I only choose the things that I'm absolutely sure of. I can only get about 30 minutes worth a week together for you. And I try to stick with those things that I'm ready to die for and the things that I'm absolutely sure of. And here's one I'm absolutely sure of. Your heart, my heart, doesn't trust God at all. And if you don't know that, if you don't see that, and if you don't realize that this is the root of so many of your problems that you don't trust Him to be out for your best, you don't know your heart.

Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache. We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way, and what can be done about it? In His brand new book that's releasing this month, what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer, drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer. Dr. Keller shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us. And how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes or choices, or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world will help you see how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us. This newly released book What Is Wrong with the World is our thanks for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the good news of Jesus.

Look at what they say, they say, our souls are dried up, why? Because we see nothing but this man up now. See what he's saying? This is what they're saying. Because we have nothing but what God has given us, we're drying up. If we take only what God's given us, we're going to dry up. If we rely only on what God has done, if we rely wholly on him, if we center wholly on him, we're going to die. It won't be enough.

Now, by the way, this is an absolute lie. In Deuteronomy 8, when their wilderness wanderings are done, God comes to them and He actually says, during the time you were in the wilderness, your feet did not swell. Now, you know, if you don't know this number's 11 passage and you don't know a little bit about biology and anatomy and physiology, you won't know what in the world's going on. Your feet swell up when you don't have a proper nutrient scurvy, for example, made your feet swell. You didn't have enough vitamin C. What God is doing is He's coming back in Deuteronomy 8 and He's saying, in spite of what you have said, the manna was enough. You didn't think it was enough, but it was. I fed you on, manna. It had every nutrient you needed, it had all the vitamins you needed, it had everything you needed.

But, well, then what are they saying here? They're saying, but we feel faint. We feel like we're drawing up, but it's not that hard to see. If two or three people get together and say, hey, let's tell them so and so that she looks terrible. And if you do that over and over again, you know, call them up, talk to her, after while she starts to feel sick, of course she will. And that's funny, but this is not funny. This is exactly what we do with sin. We look at our lives because this is what they did. They decided the manna wasn't enough, and therefore they felt sick. This isn't enough. I'm feeling faint. I'm feeling nauseated. This man isn't enough. And of course, they talked themselves into it. They really were sick. They really did feel that way. That's exactly what we do in sin. You look around your life and say, there's not enough beauty here. There's not enough success here. There's not enough love here. And if you tell yourself that, you'll start to feel faint and you will feel sick and you will start to pass out. You talk yourself into it.

And you know why? Underneath it all, we say, God, if I just trust God, I will dry up. Now somebody says, I don't believe that. Let me show you how basic this is to all of our problems. Let me give you a very religious person and a very irreligious person, just for a second. A very, very irreligious person in New York City, for example, will say, what? Obey the Tank Commandments, go to church, get down on my knees and confess on the center, pray, give my money away, no sex outside of merit, hey, religion, I want to enjoy life. What is that? If I obey God wholly and completely without fudging, without cutting any corners, I'll dry up. They believe that. That's an assault, they laugh and they say it's an assault on the goodness of God. It is. And there's many of you who are saying the same thing. I know what the Bible says, but I got to cut this corner. I know the Bible says I shouldn't do this, but I have to. I know the Bible says I shouldn't, but I know the Bible says I shouldn't. I know what religion says, I know what Christianity says, but I really can't. I've got to supplement myself if I only do nothing but what God says, I'll dry up. Nothing but this manna, won't be enough.

On the other hand, let me show you a religious person. The typical religious person is somebody who's always feeling kind of guilty, always feeling kind of anxious. Say something, you know, you say, you can be received by God not on the basis of anything you do, not on the basis of your good works, but surely and strictly and completely because Jesus died for you and loves you. And if you trust in Him instead of your own good works for your salvation, He'll receive you. You know what they say? You know what? Really, moralistic religious people say, that's too easy. They always say that, in fact, some of you are saying that, that's too easy, I don't believe that. You've got to be good. I've got to add something of my own. Nothing but isn't enough, I'll dry up. Don't you realize the person who doesn't believe God really forgives or the person who thinks obedience is just going to make my life, you know, it's going to hold me and I'm not going to be able to enjoy life if I'm totally obedient. Your life is poisoned by this. You don't trust God.

And because you don't trust God, do you see how it works? Because you don't trust God. The things that you turn to cannot fulfill you the way God did, the way God was supposed to. You know, when David put on Saul's armor, it wasn't built for him. Remember that? Little David, before he went off to Goliath, Saul says, put on my armor, that'll protect you. He put on his armor and the armor didn't fit him. You know, it chafed on him and it dragged him down and it impeded him. When you turn to things besides God, you don't trust God, nothing but the man. You don't trust God to fulfill you say, I'm going to have to do this. I want this as well. I want this as well. I want this as well. I want this as well. Those things will not fulfill you. They will not satisfy you and you will find fault with them. You have to. They'll never satisfy, they'll never please. And everything around you because you don't trust him. You will find fault with. You'll be picky, picky, picky. Your flammatic will be going off all the time.

### The Antidote to Envy

Now what's the antidote? Well, here's the antidote. What was their antidote? What they should have done if they had not despised the manor. If they had said, look at this great thing that God's given us. Instead of saying, we wish we had fish, we wish we had leeks and onions and melons and garlic. Instead of they said, what a miracle this is. If they had focused, yeah, it's only one thing. There's nothing wrong with saying, Lord, how about two kinds of manor? How about light meat and dark meat or something, light and dark manor, how about something else? Yeah, all right. Manor, it's one thing, all right. But instead of focusing on that, the fact it was the same. Why didn't they focus on the fact that it was there? Why didn't they focus on the fact that it was mercy? Why didn't they focus on the fact it was a miracle? Why didn't they focus on the mercy and goodness of God? And if they had stopped despising with the spirit of Thanksgiving, the manor, then they would not have been talking themselves into their misery.

Now what's the lesson here? The lesson is, if you are finding fault with everything, if you're looking out there and everything is bad or wrong, the Bible tells you it's because you have despised the true manor of heaven in some way. The only reason we're unhappy with everything is because we've despised the true manor. Well, what's the true manor? Well Jesus had a conversation in John 6 and in John 6, they get together and they said to him, you know what, how do we know you're from God? Our forefathers, they knew that God was with them because God sent the manor. How do we know God's with you? And Jesus says, you know the manor that Moses gave you? That was good stuff, but it was just a symbol of the bread from heaven I can give you. And he says, do you know why your souls are so empty? Do you know why you can't feel happy about anything? Do you know why nothing satisfies you? It's because you don't have this bread from heaven. It's because you don't have eternal life, a kind of joy and a kind of power and a kind of love that fulfills you. If you eat this bread from heaven, the bread I give you, you will never hunger again.

You know what they say? They said, sir, give us this bread. If this is the reason why we can't find happiness anywhere, if this is the reason why nothing's good enough, give it to us and what did he say? I am the bread of life. I am the bread that comes down from heaven. And you know what they immediately did? They despised him. They despised him. You know what they said? They said, you aren't you the son of Joseph, aren't you the carpenter? Give me a break. You can read that in John chapter 641. They despised him just like they despised this manor. And that's exactly the way Jesus Christ and the gospel itself has always been treated.

In New York City, if you bring this up, if you just say to the average person that you work with or that you study with or something, you say, I believe Jesus is the son of God. It came down from heaven to save us from our sins, that his blood is atone for our sins. And now if we receive him, we can be born again. And what do they say? They don't say, well, this is a very interesting theory. Let's talk about it. Oh no. They despise it. This manor. They have contempt. You say they look down at it. You know, when Paul preached it, Paul, the great mind, he preached on, you know, at the area of apagus on Athens Hill. What do they say to him? They say, oh, this is very interesting. They said, what does this babbler have to say? And you know, when Jesus Christ himself moved through his life, they continually despised him. They treated him like the manor. They said, can anything good come out of Nazareth? Nothing good comes out of Nazareth, right? And when he was crucified, he was mocked. They said, you say you're a king. We'll treat you as a king. Here's a crown of thorns. And as they stood there bleeding, they said, hail king of the Jews. You say you're a prophet? See? We'll see if you're a prophet. They blindfold and they start beating him and they said, if you're a prophet, prophesy, who just hit you? Contempt. They despised him. Isaiah 53 says, he was despised and rejected and we esteemed and not.

But this is how he saved us. Because as we despised him, he refused to despise us. As a matter of fact, this is the polar opposite to the flammatics in our heart. He didn't just refuse to despise us. He did the opposite. You know what we do? We look past the good to hate things. He looked past our evil to love us. There's this place in the movie, guarding tests. Any of you see that? Shirley McLean plays the widow of a president. And she's guarded by a secret service agent and she insists on this one secret service agent, Nicholas Cage. And you know why? She knew what most people didn't know that her husband was unfaithful to her. Her husband, the president, had been really quite a cad. And therefore, when he died in office, people wept but they didn't know him. They didn't know him. But she knew that Nicholas Cage, the secret service agent, knew what kind of man he was, knew about all his flaws, knew what a coward in many ways he was, knew what a cad he was, but she saw him cry at the funeral. And she said, here's somebody who knew him, but still loved him. And that's why she insisted that he always stay by her side, because she also knew him, but still loved him. That's the opposite of envy. And that's what Jesus Christ does. He knows you, says in John chapter 2, he knew it was in us and he didn't trust us. He knows our sinful heart so much that he doesn't even trust us, but he's the opposite. He goes by the good to hate and focus on the flaws. He goes by the evil and he loves us anyway. He refused to despise us, despisers.

Now friends, do you understand that? I'll just close with two things. First of all, some of you don't really maybe understand even the gospel. Here's the gospels right here. Jesus Christ is the bread of heaven. Bread cannot make you whole unless it's broken. If you have looked at Jesus Christ as a kind of model or an example over the years that you emulate, he's a failure as a model. Do you know that? You know why he's a failure? If you think to be a Christian is just to emulate him and just to try to be like him, he's a failure as a model. Because all he'll do is make you feel terrible. You'll never live up to it. But if you see him as broken bread, if you break the bread, then you can be whole. If the bread stays whole, you starve. If the bread is broken, you can be whole. If the bread is whole, you will stay broken. Jesus Christ says, I'm the bread of life. I give my flesh for the life of the world until you see him as having been despised for you, paying for the fact that you're a despiser, paying for your sin. Until you see him as that, you'll never receive this new life. You'll never receive his love. You'll never receive his joy. It'll never come into you and turn you into a whole different kind of person. One that knows how to look by the evil and a firm.

But now, Christian friends, all I can say to you is, you may say, I know this, why is my flawed manner going crazy still? And I'll tell you why is going crazy still? Because you're not remembering these things. Friends, look at Jesus. Instead of focusing on the sins around people, you ought to be looking past it. You ought to be the easiest people in the world to be a failure in front of. Are you the kind of person like Jesus who says the Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak? I know you mean well. Or remember the woman caught in adultery? What did he say? Neither do I condemn thee, but go and sin no more. Or are you the kind of person that, when somebody, you find something wrong with someone you're saying, I found you. There it is. Are you an easy person to fail in front of? Are you an affirming person? Are you a person who knows how to cover up people's nakedness? I don't mean not deal with it. I mean love them in spite of it. If you can't, if you're not patient, if you're not able to enjoy with gratitude, what God has given you. If you're not able to sit down and enjoy it and live a life of gratitude, unless you're able to discipline yourself to look at all of life in gratitude, you've forgotten what he's done for you. You don't like the person that you're having to be thrown together with right now? He say, ah, they give me the creeps. You gave Jesus the creeps. And he looked right past the creeps. And he loved you. He refused to despise you. How can you despise them? Are you unhappy with your situation right now? The fault, dear Brutus, is not in your stars. It's in yourselves. You ought to look at your problems right now and say, look, there are things that I should change and I will change, but I'm not going to be miserable today. You know why? Because if I was in the Garden of Eden today, with my heart operating, the way my heart is operating, it would not be enough. But Jesus is good enough. And he died for me to make me good enough even for the Father.

Let's pray. Our Father, we ask that you'd help us to overcome the envy, that you'd help us to overcome it. And it was to overcome the fault-finding, the misery that is to great degree self-imposed, help us not to despise your son and the gospel, but help us to see that he refused to despise those who despised him so that we might become affirming people, people who live lives of affirmation and gratitude. Make us so we ask it in Jesus' name, amen.

### 引言：嫉妒的问题

有些人说，世界的根本问题是贫穷。其他人则认为是糟糕的制度、教育不足或生物学，但如果这些都不能完全解释我们在头条新闻和我们自己心中看到的破碎呢？在今天的教导中，Tim Keller 看圣经关于罪的教导如何给我们一个深刻诚实但又极其充满希望的世界观。

今天早上的教导基于一个印在公告上的文本。这是一个简短的文本。给你一点背景，当我们印刷这样简短的文本时。这是《民数记》第11章，第4-6节。这发生在一个相当长的叙述中，许多人熟悉以色列的广泛轮廓，以色列人是埃及的奴隶劳动力。他们在埃及，在鞭打下帮助建造了伟大的金字塔和许多古埃及的伟大建筑作品。但他们是奴隶。他们被残酷压迫。他们被殴打。他们被杀害。当他们变得太多时，他们的许多孩子被屠杀。这是一个可怕的情况。

但上帝通过摩西带领他们通过奇迹般的标志，穿过红海。但在他们前往迦南的路上，在他们前往应许之地的路上，他们必须穿过一个荒漠的沙漠。在沙漠中根本没有食物，根本没有食物。上帝为他们提供了一种供应。它被称为吗哪。吗哪是一种非常奇怪的现象。它随着露水降下。我们被告知每周六个早晨，不是最后一个早晨。它躺在地上，我们被告知它看起来像芫荽种子，看起来像树脂。它很轻。可以做成蛋糕。这是他们唯一能吃的东西。但这就是他们能够维持自己的东西。

> “他们中间的乌合之众开始贪恋别的食物。以色列人又哭号说，‘谁给我们肉吃呢？我们记得在埃及时，吃鱼是免费的，还有黄瓜、甜瓜、韭菜、洋葱和大蒜。现在我们的胃口全无，除了这吗哪，我们什么也看不见。’”

**这是上帝的话。**

### 嫉妒的症状

从未有人更愿意承认人类是病态的。有某种东西。我们里面有一种病。我们对彼此残忍。我们以我们似乎无法治愈的方式对彼此施加残忍。我们心中有一种根深蒂固的不快乐，我们似乎无法消除。

在过去的100年里，我会说西方对我们为何如此残忍和不快乐的主流理解是环境因素。它来自于外部的东西。它来自于条件。但现在在过去几十年，尤其是过去10年左右，越来越多的知识分子、聪明人、哲学家、思想家越来越愿意承认有比这更深层次的东西。

他们可能实际上开始说，莎士比亚可能是对的，当他说“布鲁图斯的过错不在我们的星星，而在我们自己”时，可能是对的，里面有东西。而圣经，当然，几个世纪以来一直在说，人类的问题不是环境的，而是本质的，我们里面有一种毒药。它被称为罪。正如多萝西·塞耶斯所描述的那样，我们几周前提到过，多萝西·塞耶斯将罪定义为灵魂的深层内部错位。

这种毒药如此深地毒害了我们，并且有毒药的症状。当你服用毒药时，在你最终死亡之前，会有症状，你的症状。如果你想了解自己是否中毒，你必须了解症状。你永远不会理解你自己的人生，你永远不会理解社会，你永远不会理解人类，你永远不会理解生活，除非你理解罪的症状。

我认为在这个系列中，我们一直在研究罪的毒药如何扭曲我们的生活的各种方式。我认为这是一个非常充满希望的系列，因为你看，只有当你理解这些症状，只有当你理解它们的本质和来源时，你才会理解它们的解药。

所以今天，让我们再看看罪的毒药的一个主要症状。让我们看看症状、根本原因和解药。症状、根本原因和解药，症状是嫉妒。

我们在这个关于以色列人在荒野中的故事中看到了这一点。马上，我知道嫉妒这个词对你来说意义不大，它不会让你感到恐惧和颤抖，因为我们倾向于以非常狭隘的方式定义嫉妒。我们认为嫉妒只是对他人金钱或类似东西的非常有意识的嫉妒。我想向你展示圣经教导我们，嫉妒比这更普遍，比这更具破坏性，比这更深刻和危险。

这些人有的问题是，他们中间的乌合之众开始贪恋别的食物，以色列人又哭号说，‘谁给我们肉吃呢？我们记得在埃及时，吃鱼是免费的，还有黄瓜、甜瓜、韭菜、洋葱和大蒜。’现在在第六节，如果你看看这个，我喜欢我们通常在公告中印刷的新国际版圣经的翻译，它仍然是我最喜欢的版本，我很高兴推荐它。这是我不得不说翻译最不幸的少数几次之一。他们字面上说，我们的灵魂干涸了。这是一个非常自由的翻译，也是一个不幸的翻译。字面上我们的灵魂，他们在这里使用的希伯来词Nephese是指他们的生命力，你知道他们在说什么吗？我们的灵魂干涸了。它说，我们正在死去，因为我们除了这吗哪什么也没有。我们正在死去。我们感到虚弱。我们感到恶心。这不足以维持我们。我们的灵魂干涸了。

他们在谈论什么？这是相当简单的事情。嫉妒是一种深深毒害我们的状态，使我们无法享受眼前的东西。无法坐下来活在当下，享受我们所拥有的，而是挑剔它并说这不够好。这不够好。嫉妒是那种心态，有时它更强烈，有时它更弱。它在某些人中比在其他人中更强烈。它在你生活中的某些时候比在其他时候更强烈。但它在那里，因为我们都是罪人，我们都被这种毒药毒害。嫉妒是那种让我们无法坐下来享受眼前的东西的东西。我们找出问题所在。这不够好。

换句话说，嫉妒是那种心态，它说，回到那里，那里，我可以快乐，但我现在拥有的东西不够好。看看缺陷。看看有什么问题。看，如果我有那种情况，如果我有那种情况，我可以快乐。回到那里，如果像以前那样，我可以快乐，那里。如果事情能以这种方式发生，但现在的方式，现在不够好。

看，以色列人。这很有趣，我想。当他们在埃及时，他们说，是的，我们有很多食物，而且是免费的，当然，他们是奴隶，没有为此付钱。鱼、韭菜、柠檬、甜瓜和所有这些东西都来了。好吧，这是免费的，但当他们在那里时，他们说，但当你不自由时，这些免费的食物有什么用。但现在他们自由了，他们在说什么？如果我们要饿死，我们的自由有什么用？当他们在那里时，那里我可以快乐，但现在这不够好。当他们在那里时，回到那里我可以快乐，但现在这不够好。

我会让你笑得更多。有些人认为纽约人比其他任何人都有更多的问题。有一个理论。有人读过几周前的《纽约时报》杂志，约翰·蒂尔尼写的一篇文章，叫做“挑剔，挑剔，挑剔”，你看到了吗？他说，纽约人特别有他称之为内部缺陷探测器的东西。现在，缺陷探测器是那种专注于缺陷，专注于错误，专注于有什么问题的东西，所以我们说，我讨厌这个，这不够好。现在我们在餐馆上使用它，我们在艺术上使用它，我们在朋友上使用它，我们在职业上使用它，但他说，当我们在约会时使用它，当我们在考虑约会的人或我们正在评估的潜在约会对象或伴侣时，我们会完全疯狂。

他这样说，他说，例如，他讲述了一个纽约人对另一个纽约人说的话，他听到了这个，关于他有的一个盲约会。他说，好吧，他说开始很好，她打开门，她看起来很棒。漂亮的脸，好的身材，漂亮的笑容，一切看起来都很好，直到她转过身来，查克他说，她有肮脏的肘部。就这样，那个人继续约会的其余部分，但他知道关系的可能性绝对是注定的。起初我想，你知道，也许有某种方法可以解决这个问题，一些治疗，一些肥皂和水，但后来我意识到这无关紧要，他会发现其他问题。

这继续引用，就像我多年来从纽约的朋友那里听到的关于为什么最新的关系出了问题的原因。一个对我说，好吧，她真的看起来很聪明，但后来她发音错误了歌德。我知道她在装。另一个说，我们之间没有未来，显然每个人都认为她应该减掉大约七磅，但她似乎没有注意到。每个人都说，哦，当然，他是合伙人，但这不是一个很大的公司，除此之外，他穿着这些小短黑袜子，当他交叉双腿时会露出他的腿。多年来，我知道我对一个女人的要求是绝对合理的，我只想要一个有时尚模特背景的小说家/宇航员，但我看不到，我看到我所有其他朋友都太挑剔，挑剔，挑剔。

现在你笑了，我的朋友们，头痛可能只是没有戴太阳镜驾驶的症状，你知道，或者可能是脑肿瘤的症状。可能是非常轻微和短暂的东西，也可能是非常深刻的东西。圣经说，是的，也许在纽约人中，这更糟。事实上，蒂尔尼实际上说了一些我认为非常非常有力和正确的话。他说，为什么我们会这样？为什么我们比其他地方更糟？为什么我们这样对待自己？为什么我们这样对待别人？为什么这种宇宙性的缺陷探测器？他说，也许纽约让居民发疯，也许与财富和魅力的近距离接触扭曲了我们的视野。但他所说的只是这里更糟。

看，圣经说这不是没有戴太阳镜驾驶的症状。这是正在侵蚀你内心的癌症的症状。这是正在完全侵蚀你内心的癌症。这非常有力。他说我们的视野被扭曲了，作者说。没错。看看这个。他们说我们的灵魂干涸了，好吗？他们说我们的灵魂干涸了。我们在埃及过得更好。现在看，你看到扭曲了吗？他们如此专注于缺陷。他们如此专注于有什么问题。他们如此专注于这个。他们的记忆完全被扭曲了。他们怎么能...我们在埃及过得更好。它是免费的。食物是免费的。当然食物是免费的。你被锁链束缚。你怎么能忽视你孩子的屠杀？但我们在埃及过得更好。他们怎么能如此扭曲？作者是对的。我们里面有东西。有一个宇宙性的缺陷探测器。它在这里疯狂。我们讨厌这些东西。我们讨厌我们的情况。这不够好。我们在埃及过得更好。

让我向你展示它有多强大。它的终极例子是伊甸园。这里是亚当和夏娃。他们在那里展示你自己。这里是亚当和夏娃。他们在天堂。这是一个完美的地方。没有死亡。没有疾病。没有任何问题。一切都是完美的。然而，通过蛇，思想来到他们那里。你能做任何你想做的事吗？不，他们说不是任何事。我们不被允许吃那棵树。其他任何东西。我们可以做其他任何事情。我们可以吃其他任何东西，但不是那棵树。然后思想回来了。多么糟糕，它是最好的。我敢打赌它比所有其他树加起来都好。他们不满意。他们觉得我能想到比伊甸园更好的情况。

你认为这意味着什么？听着，我不在乎你现在对你的环境有多不满意。如果你理解圣经告诉你的，它告诉你，如果你把自己捡起来，把自己放在伊甸园里，心里和现在一样罪恶的状态，你会发现那里有问题。这就是罪所做的。它让你寻找错误。它让你寻找缺陷。它让你拒绝它。它让你...没有什么是足够好的。没有什么是足够好的。所以你很痛苦。你这样想。

所以，这就是为什么我们中的一些人从未结婚，或者当你结婚时，你总是对你结婚的人不满意的原因。这就是为什么我们中的一些人在职业生涯中如此努力，因为我们讨厌我们所在的梯子上的错误。这就是为什么你们中的一些人无法忍受镜子中的自己。这就是为什么我们中的许多人对其他人有如此批判的精神的原因。这就是为什么你们中的一些人永远无法加入教会的原因。挑剔，挑剔，挑剔。当然你会发现它。这就是为什么你不断地经历中年危机的原因。而你才二十出头。啊，因为，你知道，我只是需要改变。我不喜欢我现在的样子，那里，那里。它正在毒害你的生活。你永远无法坐下来享受眼前的东西。你永远无法坐下来接受你所拥有的东西。在某种程度上，我们都在受苦。这就是症状。

### 嫉妒的根源

好吧，你说，好吧，它的根源是什么？我可以看到为什么这有点让我的生活变得灰色，灰色的情况。这种不快乐，总是有点灰色，恼火，发痒，易怒，不快乐，对周围的每个人和一切都批判。它的根源是什么？好吧，它的根源是特定的毒药，但这里是特定的毒药是什么。你不信任上帝超过你能扔他的距离。你甚至不能扔上帝一英寸。

在我们为什么对一切都不满意的核心，以及为什么我们永远无法享受任何东西的核心，以及为什么我们总是以某种程度上痛苦的核心，以及为什么我们永远无法...我的意思是，事情一开始很好，但后来它们磨损了，嗯？它们不会磨损。你说，我想要一些新的东西。我想要一些更好的东西。我想要一些...圣经说的原因是，最终的毒药是你不信任上帝。你不信任他。你不认为他值得信赖。如果这里有人说这对我来说不是真的，你不了解你自己的心。

我不确定很多事情。我只选择那些我绝对确定的事情。我每周只能为你准备大约30分钟。我试着坚持那些我准备为之而死的事情和那些我绝对确定的事情。这里有一个我绝对确定的。你的心，我的心，根本不信任上帝。如果你不知道这一点，如果你没有看到这一点，如果你没有意识到这是你许多问题的根源，你不信任他为你的最佳利益着想，你不了解你的心。

无论我们在哪里看，我们都看到破碎、战争、残忍和心痛。我们在周围的世界和我们自己的生活中感受到了这一点。它是如何变成这样的，能做些什么呢？在他本月发布的新书中，世界出了什么问题？Tim Keller 提供了一个清晰而富有同情心的答案，借鉴了在 Redeemer 的一系列教导。Keller 博士展示了罪的现实如何解释我们周围看到的痛苦。以及只有福音才能提供持久的自由和治愈。无论你是被我们世界的状态压倒，还是在与自己的错误或选择作斗争，还是在寻找希望和快乐，世界出了什么问题将帮助你看到福音如何对我们世界的心痛和我们每个人内心的痛苦说话。这本新发布的书《世界出了什么问题》是我们本月感谢你帮助福音和生活分享耶稣好消息的礼物。今天在 gospelandlife.com/give 请求你的副本。这是 gospelandlife.com/give。

看看他们说了什么，他们说，我们的灵魂干涸了，为什么？因为我们现在只看到这吗哪。看他在说什么？这就是他们在说的。因为我们除了上帝给我们的东西什么也没有，我们正在干涸。如果我们只接受上帝给我们的东西，我们就会干涸。如果我们完全依赖上帝，如果我们完全依赖他，如果我们完全以他为中心，我们就会死。这将不够。

顺便说一句，这是一个绝对的谎言。在《申命记》第8章，当他们的荒野漂流结束时，上帝来到他们面前，他实际上说，在你们在荒野中的时间里，你们的脚没有肿胀。现在，你知道，如果你不知道这个《民数记》第11章的段落，并且你对生物学、解剖学和生理学了解不多，你就不知道世界上发生了什么。你的脚在没有适当的营养时会肿胀，例如，坏血病会使你的脚肿胀。你没有足够的维生素C。上帝正在做的是，他在《申命记》第8章中回来说，尽管你们说了什么，吗哪是足够的。你们不认为它足够，但它是。我用吗哪喂养了你们。它有你需要的每一种营养素，它有你需要的所有维生素，它有你需要的一切。

但是，好吧，那么他们在这里说什么？他们说，但我们感到虚弱。我们觉得我们正在干涸，但这并不难看出。如果两三个人聚在一起说，嘿，让我们告诉他们某某人她看起来很糟糕。如果你一遍又一遍地这样做，你知道，打电话给他们，和她说话，过一段时间她开始感到不舒服，当然她会。这很有趣，但这并不好笑。这正是我们对罪所做的。我们看着我们的生活，因为这就是他们所做的。他们决定吗哪不够，因此他们感到不适。这不够。我感到虚弱。我感到恶心。这吗哪不够。当然，他们自己说服了自己。他们真的病了。他们真的感到那样。这正是我们在罪中所做的。你环顾你的生活，说，这里没有足够的美丽。这里没有足够的成功。这里没有足够的爱。如果你告诉自己这一点，你会开始感到虚弱，你会感到不适，你会开始晕倒。你自己说服自己。

你知道为什么吗？在这一切之下，我们说，上帝，如果我只是信任上帝，我会干涸。现在有人说，我不相信。让我向你展示这对我们所有问题的基本性。让我给你一个非常宗教的人和一个非常不宗教的人，只是一会儿。例如，一个非常非常不宗教的人在纽约市会说什么？遵守十诫，去教堂，跪下承认我是罪人，祈祷，把我的钱捐出去，婚外没有性行为，嘿，宗教，我想享受生活。那是什么？如果我完全和彻底地服从上帝而不作弊，不偷工减料，我会干涸。他们相信这一点。这是一种攻击，他们笑着说这是一种对上帝善良的攻击。是的。你们中有很多人也在说同样的话。我知道圣经说什么，但我必须偷工减料。我知道圣经说我不应该这样做，但我必须。我知道圣经说我不应该，但我知道圣经说我不应该。我知道宗教说什么，我知道基督教说什么，但我真的不能。如果我只做上帝说的事情，我会干涸。只有这吗哪，不够。

另一方面，让我给你看一个宗教人士。典型的宗教人士是那种总是感到有点内疚，总是感到有点焦虑的人。你说一些话，你知道，你说，你可以被上帝接受，不是基于你做的任何事情，不是基于你的好行为，而是完全和完全因为耶稣为你而死并爱你。如果你信任他而不是你自己的好行为来获得救赎，他会接受你。你知道他们说什么吗？你知道吗？真正的道德主义宗教人士说，这太容易了。他们总是这么说，事实上，你们中的一些人也在这么说，这太容易了，我不相信。你必须做好。我必须添加一些我自己的东西。只有不够，我会干涸。你难道不知道不相信上帝真的宽恕的人或认为服从只是会让我的生活，你知道，它会束缚我，我将无法享受生活，如果我完全服从。你的生活被这毒害了。你不信任上帝。

因为你不信任上帝，你看到它是如何运作的吗？因为你不信任上帝。你转向的东西不能像上帝那样满足你，像上帝应该那样满足你。你知道，当大卫穿上扫罗的盔甲时，它不适合他。记得吗？小大卫，在他去戈利亚之前，扫罗说，穿上我的盔甲，那会保护你。他穿上了他的盔甲，盔甲不适合他。你知道，它在他身上摩擦，它拖累了他，它阻碍了他。当你转向除了上帝之外的东西时，你不信任上帝，只有这吗哪。你不信任上帝来满足你说，我必须这样做。我也想要这个。我也想要这个。我也想要这个。我也想要这个。那些东西不会满足你。它们不会让你满意，你会发现它们的缺陷。你必须。它们永远不会满足，它们永远不会取悦。因为你不信任他，你会对周围的一切挑剔。你的缺陷探测器会一直响个不停。

### 嫉妒的解药

那么解药是什么？好吧，这就是解药。他们的解药是什么？如果他们没有轻视吗哪，他们应该做什么。如果他们说，看看上帝给我们的伟大东西。与其说，我们希望我们有鱼，我们希望我们有韭菜、洋葱、甜瓜和大蒜。与其说，他们说，这是什么奇迹。如果他们专注，是的，这只是一个东西。没有什么错，说，主啊，怎么不来两种吗哪？怎么不来白肉和黑肉，或者什么，白和黑吗哪，怎么不来别的东西？是的，好吧。吗哪，这是一件事，好吧。但与其专注于这一点，事实是它是一样的。为什么他们不专注于它的存在？为什么他们不专注于它是怜悯？为什么他们不专注于它是一个奇迹？为什么他们不专注于上帝的怜悯和善良？如果他们停止轻视感恩的精神，吗哪，那么他们就不会把自己说服成他们的痛苦。

那么这里的教训是什么？教训是，如果你对一切都挑剔，如果你看到外面的一切都不好或错误，圣经告诉你，这是因为你以某种方式轻视了真正的天上吗哪。我们对一切不满的唯一原因是因为我们轻视了真正的吗哪。那么真正的吗哪是什么？好吧，耶稣在约翰福音第6章中有一次对话，在约翰福音第6章中，他们聚在一起对他说，你知道吗，我们怎么知道你是从上帝来的？我们的祖先，他们知道上帝与他们同在，因为上帝送来了吗哪。我们怎么知道上帝与你同在？耶稣说，你知道摩西给你的吗哪吗？那是好东西，但它只是我可以给你的天上之粮的象征。他说，你知道为什么你的灵魂如此空虚吗？你知道为什么你对任何事情都感到不快乐吗？你知道为什么没有什么能让你满意吗？因为你没有这天上之粮。因为你没有永生，一种快乐，一种力量，一种爱，能满足你。如果你吃这天上之粮，我给你的面包，你将永远不再饥饿。

你知道他们说什么吗？他们说，先生，给我们这面包。如果这是我们无法在任何地方找到快乐的原因，如果这是没有什么足够好的原因，给我们它，他说了什么？我是生命的面包。我是从天上降下来的面包。你知道他们立即做了什么吗？他们轻视了他。他们轻视了他。你知道他们说什么吗？他们说，你不是约瑟的儿子吗，不是木匠吗？开玩笑吧。你可以在约翰福音第6章41节中读到。他们轻视了他，就像他们轻视这吗哪一样。这正是耶稣基督和福音本身一直被对待的方式。

在纽约市，如果你提起这个，如果你只是对你工作的普通人说，或者你学习的人说，我相信耶稣是上帝的儿子。他从天上降下来拯救我们脱离罪恶，他的血为我们的罪赎罪。现在如果我们接受他，我们可以重生。他们说什么？他们不说，好吧，这是一个非常有趣的理论。让我们谈谈它。哦，不。他们轻视它。这吗哪。他们有轻蔑。你说他们看不起它。你知道，当保罗传道时，保罗，这位伟大的思想家，他在雅典山上的阿雷奥帕古斯传道。他们对他说什么？他们说，哦，这很有趣。他们说，这个闲言碎语者有什么要说的？你知道，当耶稣基督自己走过他的一生时，他们不断轻视他。他们像对待吗哪一样对待他。他们说，拿撒勒能出什么好东西吗？拿撒勒没有好东西，对吧？当他被钉十字架时，他被嘲笑。他们说，你说你是王。我们会把你当作王。这里有一个荆棘冠冕。当他们站在那里流血时，他们说，犹太人的王万岁。你说你是先知吗？看？我们会看看你是不是先知。他们蒙住他的眼睛，开始打他，他们说，如果你是先知，预言，谁刚打了你？轻蔑。他们轻视了他。以赛亚书53章说，他被轻视和拒绝，我们不尊重他。

但这就是他如何拯救我们的。因为当我们轻视他时，他拒绝轻视我们。事实上，这与我们心中的缺陷探测器完全相反。他不仅拒绝轻视我们。他做了相反的事情。你知道我们做什么吗？我们越过好的去憎恨东西。他越过我们的邪恶去爱我们。在电影《守护特斯》中有一个地方。你们中有人看过吗？雪莉·麦克莱恩扮演总统的遗孀。她由一个特勤局特工保护，她坚持要这个特勤局特工，尼古拉斯·凯奇。你知道为什么吗？她知道大多数人不知道她的丈夫对她不忠。她的丈夫，总统，真的相当花心。因此，当他在任上去世时，人们哭泣，但他们不了解他。他们不了解他。但她知道尼古拉斯·凯奇，特勤局特工，知道他是什么样的人，知道他的所有缺点，知道他在许多方面是个懦夫，知道他是个花心的人，但她看到他在葬礼上哭泣。她说，这里有一个知道他的人，但仍然爱他。这就是为什么她坚持让他一直留在她身边，因为她也了解他，但仍然爱他。这与嫉妒相反。这就是耶稣基督所做的。他了解你，约翰福音第2章说，他知道我们里面的东西，他不信任我们。他如此了解我们的罪恶之心，以至于他甚至不信任我们，但他是相反的。他越过好的去憎恨和专注于缺陷。他越过邪恶，他仍然爱我们。他拒绝轻视我们，轻视者。

现在朋友们，你们明白吗？我只想用两件事来结束。首先，你们中的一些人可能甚至不真正理解福音。这里的福音就在这里。耶稣基督是天上的面包。面包不能使你完整，除非它被打破。如果你多年来一直把耶稣基督看作一种榜样或模范，你模仿，他作为榜样是失败的。你知道吗？你知道为什么他是失败的吗？如果你认为成为基督徒只是模仿他，只是试图像他一样，他作为榜样是失败的。因为他所做的一切只会让你感到糟糕。你永远无法达到它。但如果你把他看作破碎的面包，如果你打破面包，那么你可以完整。如果面包保持完整，你会饿死。如果面包被打破，你可以完整。如果面包是完整的，你将保持破碎。耶稣基督说，我是生命的面包。我为世界的生命献出我的肉，直到你看到他为你被轻视，为你是轻视者而付出代价，为你的罪付出代价。直到你看到他是这样，你永远不会接受这种新生活。你永远不会接受他的爱。你永远不会接受他的快乐。它永远不会进入你，改变你成为一个完全不同的人。一个知道如何越过邪恶和坚定的人。

但现在，基督徒朋友们，我只能对你们说，你可能会说，我知道这一点，为什么我的缺陷探测器仍然疯狂？我会告诉你为什么它仍然疯狂？因为你没有记住这些事情。朋友们，看着耶稣。与其专注于周围人的罪，你应该越过它。你应该是世界上最容易在面前失败的人。你是那种像耶稣一样的人，他说精神是愿意的，但肉体是软弱的？我知道你是好意的。或者记得那个被抓到通奸的女人？他说了什么？我也不定你的罪，但去，不要再犯罪。或者你是那种，当有人，你发现某人有问题时，你说，我找到了你。就是这样。你是一个容易在面前失败的人吗？你是一个肯定的人吗？你是一个知道如何掩盖人们赤裸的人吗？我不是说不处理它。我是说尽管如此爱他们。如果你不能，如果你不耐心，如果你不能享受上帝给你的东西。如果你不能坐下来享受它，过一种感恩的生活，除非你能够训练自己以感恩的态度看待生活的所有方面，你已经忘记了他为你做了什么。你不喜欢你现在不得不和某人一起被扔在一起吗？他说，啊，他们让我毛骨悚然。你让耶稣毛骨悚然。他越过毛骨悚然。他爱你。他拒绝轻视你。你怎么能轻视他们呢？你对你现在的情况不满意吗？亲爱的布鲁图斯，过错不在你的星星，而在你自己。你应该看看你现在的问题，说，看，有些事情我应该改变，我会改变，但我今天不会痛苦。你知道为什么吗？因为如果我今天在伊甸园里，我的心在运作，我的心在运作的方式，它将不够。但耶稣足够好。他为我而死，使我即使对父亲来说也足够好。

让我们祈祷。我们的父亲，我们请求你帮助我们克服嫉妒，帮助我们克服它。并且克服自我施加的错误发现、痛苦，帮助我们不要轻视你的儿子和福音，而是帮助我们看到他拒绝轻视那些轻视他的人，以便我们可以成为肯定的人，过肯定和感恩生活的人。使我们如此，我们奉耶稣的名祈求，阿门。
