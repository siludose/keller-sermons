Welcome to Gospel and Life. How do we share what it means to truly know Jesus? Not just as a historical figure or moral teacher,  but as Savior and King. This month, Tim Keller explores what the Bible shows us  about being public with our faith  and sharing the hope we have in Christ. Tonight's Scripture comes from a book of John.

Chapter 4, verses 27 through 42. Just then his disciples returned  and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, what do you want or why are you talking with her? Then, leaving her water jar,  the woman went back to the town and said to the people,  come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah that came out of the town  and made their way toward him?

Meanwhile, his disciples urged him,  rabbi eats something, but he said to them,  I have food to eat that you know nothing about. Then his disciples said to each other,  could someone have brought him food? My food, said Jesus,  is to do the will of him who sent me  and to finish his work. Don't you have a saying it's still four months until the harvest? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields.

They are ripe for harvest. Even now the one who reaps draws a wage  and harvest a crop for eternal life  so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together. Thus the saying one sows and another reeps is true. I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work  and you have reaped the benefits of their labor.

Many of the Samaritans from that town believed him  because of the woman's testimony he told me everything I ever did. So when the Samaritans came to him,  they urged him to stay with them  and he stayed two days. And because of his words, many more became believers. They said to the woman,  we no longer believe just because of what you said,  now we have heard for ourselves  and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world. The Word of the Lord.

We're beginning a new series called Public Faith. Sharing the hope that s within. We live in a very pluralistic society,  New York particularly. Your neighbor probably holds deeply sharply divergent beliefs  about things to your beliefs. Now in a situation like that,  pluralistic everybody s so different in their beliefs,  here s the question,  how can people be true to themselves  and not hide who they are and still get along?

I mean no matter who you are,  if you care about the social fabric,  that s a huge question to answer. Because there s really only three,  I think possible alternatives. Either you hide who you are  for fear that your neighbor will be angry at you  or you speak out about your beliefs and who you are  in such a way that you provoke anger in your neighbor  or you learn how to share who you are  and you are open about who you are,  but to do it in such a way that creates peace and civility  and of course the third alternative  is the only one that has integrity  and is the only one that really is,  it holds out a prospect of hope for a pluralistic society  and therefore even though we re going to be looking  at what the Bible says each week about how Christians  should be public with their faith,  this issue should concern everybody  and my goal is to show Christians  how they can be part of the solution. And that means whether you re a Christian  or whether you don t believe in Christianity  or whether you re not sure what you believe,  this will be of relevance to you. And we re all very excited about the fact that thousands  of people in not only the beta groups  but the small groups in our church  are studying this material every week  and applying it to real life.

Now the first week we re just looking at the very subject  of what public faith is and why faith should be public. And we re looking at what was read to you  was the last half of a great story about Jesus Christ  meeting a woman of Samaria at the well. It starts at the very beginning of chapter 4  and in a minute I re going to recount it  but what I want to do is look particularly at the  aftermath and that s here in verses 27 to 42. Immediately after speaking to this woman,  Jesus talks to his disciples  and he gets real metaphorical  and he talks about spiritual sewing,  seed and reaping. Now what is that?

What is he trying to get across in that metaphor? I want to delve into that and ask that question. What is he talking about there? And I like to look at that under three headings. Jesus here actually gives us a call to spiritual sewing of seed  and then he shows us in this passage  the method of doing it, how to do it,  and then thirdly the power or the inner motivation for doing it.

So the call to it,  the method of it, the power for it. Okay? Now let s first of all,  let s look at the call to spiritual sewing of seed. What is this? Let me give you the context.

What s happened right before this part? I told you that Jesus has had a very famous and very intriguing encounter  with a woman of Samaria at the well. Jesus has been traveling with his disciples  and as he s traveling through Samaria he stops at a well. His disciples go into town to get some food,  leaving him alone at the well. A woman also comes out from the town to draw water from the well  and they engage in a conversation.

And Jesus very gently and persistently tries to draw her out  and get her attention and he does it by using a metaphor,  an illustration. And he says, I have water that if you drank it,  you d never thirst again. And she says, really? All right? Let me have that water.

And he says, okay, you want the water? Go get your husband. She says, I don t have a husband. Right? He says, and very matter-facally, non-condemnally,  and gently says, you re right.

You don t have a husband. You ve had five husbands and the man you re living with right now is not your husband. Wait a minute. Why, when she said, give me this water of life, this water that satisfies,  so you never have to be thirsty again, give this water to me. And he says, go get your husband.

What is he doing? He s brilliantly showing her that he s not talking about physical water,  that he s talking about soul satisfaction, soul satiation,  the satisfaction of a soul thirst. And it s what she s been looking for and hoping to get that soul satisfaction  in men, in family, in romance, in sexual relationships,  and it hasn t happened to her. And now amazed with his insight, surprised at how much he knows about her,  impressed with how loving it is for him to be talking to woman in public,  and perhaps sensing a hidden power. And she calls him out, and she says, you know,  when Messiah comes, he will tell us about all these deep things.

And Jesus very dramatically says,  I, the one speaking to you, am he. And that is verse 26, that s the first 26 verses of chapter 4. And immediately upon him telling her this,  did disciples come back? See, verse 27, the disciples returned. She, verse 29, leased her water jug and goes into the town to start talking to her friends about what just happened to her,  and we ll get back to that in a second.

But in this context of him pointing her to eternal life and pointing her to belief in himself,  and then her going off and pointing the people of the town to him,  he gives this metaphor. He says, first of all, I have a food, this is now in verse 33,  he's using the kind of enigmatic, cryptic, metaphorical way that ancient sages would speak to the disciples  as a way of trying to get them to think, draw them out, focus their attention. And he says, I have a food,  and that food is to do the will of him who sent me into finishes work. Now right there, even that sentence all by itself is fascinating,  because he's actually saying, my meat and my drink,  that which gives me sustenance. The main thing I do is the work that God has given me, the one who sent me has given me this work.

Well, what is this work? Then he calls it harvesting or spiritual sowing and reaping. And the reason we know is spiritual, the reason we know that what he's talking about as a metaphor,  is because he talks about here in verse 36,  he says, we're talking about a crop of eternal life,  and therefore here's what he's saying, especially in context of,  he's talking metaphorically about what just happened with the woman,  and what's happening now between her and her friends. Spiritual sowing is pointing people to eternal life through Jesus Christ,  and spiritual reaping is seeing some of them believe. Spiritual sowing is pointing people to Jesus Christ and saying there is eternal life,  spiritual reaping is sometimes seeing them believe.

And Jesus makes a couple of amazing statements about this. First of all, he's telling his disciples, this is a, remember, this is food, what does that mean? That being public with your faith, pointing people to eternal life through Jesus Christ  is not dessert, it's not hors d'oeuvres, it's not optional, it's not a treat, it's not something special,  this is meat and drink, this is what you should be here to do,  and this is what God has put me here to do, and you should be doing it too. Not only does he show that how important it is to be public with faith,  telling people about eternal life through Jesus, but he even makes,  he bursts the boundaries of this metaphor when he says,  so that sower and the reaper may be glad together. Do you know how radical it is?

The reason it doesn't immediately hit you is because you are not farmers. Sowers go out, and months later reapers go out, right? He even mentions the fact that very often there's months between sowing and reaping. He says, ah, but when it comes to the gospel, the message of eternal life through Jesus Christ,  the sower and the reaper rejoiced together, what does that mean? There is no natural seed that's so powerful that the sower and the reaper can go out together.

You know what he's talking about? He's talking about the sower going out like this,  and the reaper can be right alongside and picking up, you know, the sower puts in the sea. Up it comes, the reaper takes, and they're working together. Sowers and reapers can never work together because there's no seed that powerful,  but the gospel is that powerful. So Jesus is saying, don't say this isn't the harvest time, lift up your eyes.

I'm here. Got it? This is really very, very strong. Never say this isn't the right cultural moment. Never say this isn't the time.

Never say, well, sharing faith publicly, that's something for certain people. No, it's meat and drink. It's for my disciples. It's the work I've been given to do. Don't say this isn't the time.

It is the time. And do you see the power so powerful that the spiritual sea, in this spiritual sea,  the sower and the reaper rejoice together? This does not mean, by the way, that everybody who hears the gospel believes immediately. It's not talking individualisticly. It's not just, you can see in the book of John,  you can see in your own life, that people come to faith in different stages.

But what he's saying is in the past, John the Baptist, the prophets,  they spoke enigmatically, vaguely about it, but now I'm here. It's clear the gospel message is here, and now it's got power. So today is the day of salvation. So that's the first thing we learn here. He's calling us the spiritual sowing in very powerful terms.

If you're his disciple, if you follow him. Well, that makes us a little bit nervous. What exactly is it that he's calling us to? What does this mean? So let's take a look.

What he's talking about metaphorically, the woman is doing right now. Look at what she's doing. It says, leaving her water jar, verse 29,  the woman went back to the town and said to the people, and these are people that she lives with,  these are people she knows. Come see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?

So they came out of the town and made their way toward him. There it is. Okay, how do we analyze this? What does this mean? First of all, please notice that she doesn't get up on a box and start preaching.

Now, to get up and preach to a group of people at once is fine, I do it myself. And as Jerry Seinfeld has said, nothing does anything wrong with that. But she doesn't do that because, of course, not everybody's called with that. That's not the essence of what Jesus is calling his disciples to do, to get up like this. Also notice she goes to people she knows.

She doesn't go grab strangers. Again, not that there's anything wrong with that. But that's still not the essence. And by the way, I don't care who you are. We'll get back to this in a minute, but you can already tell.

She has a kind of checkered sexual history. She is not a moral pillar of her community. But in every community, there's always a ladder. Even we Americans who love to say we're part of a egalitarian meritocratic society,  there's always pecking orders. There's always ladders.

You know, there's people above you in your career. There's people below you. There's people older than you, younger than you. People got more. The things you want, people who got less.

And therefore, it doesn't matter if you're high up on the ladder. Talking about your faith is scary. Why? Because you got a lot to lose. What about other people up there who are going to say,  what am I?

Are you a fanatic or something? If you're in the middle of the ladder, that's not easy either. Why? Because you don't want the people above you to think you're kind of... And they want...

They want them to be able to open doors for you, think well of you. But even if you're at the bottom of the ladder, like her,  you don't want to add insult to injury. I mean, you don't want people to say, look, we always knew  you're kind of a shady character. We know you're crazy, too. There's always something to lose.

But she goes, and she speaks. And she... And this one statement actually can be broken into two parts  to show us the essence of what it means to be publicly your faith. What it means to do this spiritual selling that Jesus calls all of us disciples to do. He says, come see a man who told me everything I ever did.

Now, the two essentials of this, of being publicly your faith are  simple transparency and pointing to Jesus himself. First of all, simple transparency. Look, what does she say? He told me everything I ever did. Now, look, this is...

She does not have a set of bullet points. There's not much theological content here. She's not explaining substitutionary atonement. She is just saying, here's what happened to me. She is simply being transparent about what's going on inside.

And this is the first thing you have to understand. Basically, being publicly your faith simply means not hiding your heart. Not hiding the wellsprings of your life. Not hiding from other people who you really are. If you just stop hiding and you're just natural  and letting people know how you make decisions,  how you deal with your problems, if you're a Christian,  you're just letting people see who you are,  and then it becomes very natural.

See, look, you don't necessarily talk to anybody about these things,  but a person doesn't have to be a dear friend for you to share three things. One is, do you ever talk to people about how you're dealing with a problem  or your stress is in your life? Do you ever say... Does anybody say I've been pretty stressed out lately? You know, and I've had a deal with it.

Do you ever talk to people about decisions you make? Do you ever talk to people about priorities that you set? Now, you can talk to people who are not necessarily your closest friends,  but when you are getting to know people,  you disclose a little bit more and a little bit more. And when you get to that level, if you're a Christian,  and you don't disclose the fact that Jesus is always part  of how you deal with your problems,  the Jesus is always part of how you make your decisions. If you get to the level where you can be disclosing that,  but you don't share that part of your heart,  you are short-circuiting the natural level of disclosure and transparency that happens  as you're getting to know somebody better.

So, in other words, public faith is just don't short-circuit it, don't hide it. Look, we all know that people don't want to hear it, especially in our culture. But the point is that it's unnatural, it's wrong. It's a lack of transparency. So, you don't have to learn a bunch of bullet points or get up on a box,  you just have to stop being dishonest about how you make your decisions  and how you deal with your issues.

Just don't hide. Just don't hide. That's the first thing, personal transparency. But the second thing, notice is this. She doesn't say, come to a seminar, come read a book,  she says, come see a man.

Now, I already said this. She doesn't understand too much about Jesus yet. I mean, she says he's the Messiah or he might be the Messiah, all right. But does she know he's going to die for her or for me and you? No.

Does she know he's going to rise from the dead? No. And those are really big things. She definitely doesn't know too much theology here. And yet somehow,  she has grasped the essence of the distinction between Christianity  and all of the religions.

She's actually grasped the genius of Christianity. What is that? Well, I would say that every other religion, the main thing in that religion,  is the way. The way. So, for example, the founder, the teacher, the prophet, the sage,  the founder of the religion comes and says, here's the five pillars.

Here's the eightfold path to enlightenment, the ten-nubbelchers. In other words, they're giving people the way. They're saying if you want to find God, if you want to find salvation,  if you want to connect to the divine, if you want to be enlightened,  if you want salvation, if you want favor with God,  if you want a relationship with God, here's the way. You do this and do this and do this and think about it. Buddhism has a very well laid out path.

Four noble truths and the last noble truth is the eightfold path. And do you have to know all about Buddha for the way to work? I mean, couldn't you find enlightenment without necessarily knowing that much about Buddha? Of course not. The answer is you don't need to know a lot about Buddha.

Why not? Because Buddha brought the way, but the main thing is the way. There's someone to touch from the person who brought it. The main thing is, since you're the one, through your efforts,  that they kick God's favor and get the relationship with God,  then the important thing is the way. It's the steps.

It's the plan. It's the formula. That's the important thing. Not the founder, not the prophet, but totally different in Christianity. In John 14, when someone says to Jesus,  Lord, you know the way.

Jesus says, I am the way. Lord, you have the words of truth. I am the truth. I am the way. I am the truth.

When Martha says to Jesus, Lord, my brother died, but he will rise again  at the resurrection on the last day. What does Jesus say? Martha, I am the resurrection in the life. I am the way. I am the truth.

I am the way. Why is he talking like that? Is he just being arrogant? No. Here's what he's saying.

I am the way means all of the religious tell you what to do to find God. I am God come to find you. All of the religious tell you what to do to find God. I have come to do what you couldn't do for yourself. I have come to give you salvation as a gift, see.

We always say the gospel changes everything and we believe it really does. That's why here at Gospel and Life, August is Go and Share Month. Throughout August, we're inviting thousands of our listeners to take a small step in sharing the gospel  with someone God has placed in your life. For those of you who make a gift to Gospel and Life this month,  we'll send you two copies of making sense of God by Tim Keller. It's a powerful resource that explores how Christianity makes emotional, cultural, and rational sense in today's world.

It's our thanks for your gift and provides a way you can do a small act to share the gospel  by reading the book with a friend giving one to a coworker or passing on both copies to people  who are exploring the Christian faith. It's a simple way to start a Gospel conversation or continue it. To request your two copies of making sense of God,  simply go to Gospel and Life.com slash give. Again, that's Gospel and Life.com slash give. Now, here's Dr.

Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. And therefore, every other religion, the teacher, the founder, that's not an important thing. What's really important is that you're good and that you do the thing. You follow the way. But in Christianity, it's all about Jesus.

Jesus is the one that you rely on. Jesus is the one. He's the way. He's the truth. He's the life.

People are constantly saying to me, over the years, so often I've heard people say,  look, I'm glad you're a Christian, that's great. But I believe that all good people can get to heaven. Let me repeat that just so you hear it and see the false assumption there. Oh, I'm glad you're a Christian. But I believe all good people can get to heaven.

What's the assumption? The assumption is that Christians think that their goodness gets them to heaven,  but they shouldn't be so narrow as to think that only Christians are good. But Christians don't believe that goodness gets them to heaven. In fact, the genius of Christianity, the heart of Christianity,  is we've stopped the exhausting activity of trying to depend on our own goodness. We've escaped the exhaustion of depending on our own goodness  and we're depending on Jesus' goodness, which means you can't talk about what's happening in your heart as a Christian  without talking about Jesus.

You can't avoid it. You have to be pointing to his beauty. You have to be pointing to him, and she understood that. And so there's the essence of what it means to be public with your faith. Just be transparent about what's going on in your heart,  but you must talk about, you must refer to, you must point to Jesus.

Now, this is New York City, and many of you who live here know  that the 18 minutes that I've just spent are completely offensive  to most New Yorkers. Because most New Yorkers say this,  it's all right for you as Christians to believe what you believe,  but you should not convert people. You should not tell people that Christianity is better or truer than their beliefs  and that they should change. You should not try to convert people. You should not say your beliefs are better or truer than theirs  and that they should change.

You mustn't do that. You've heard that statement before. Maybe you believe that. I want to show you for two reasons that that's absolutely wrong. That statement's absolutely wrong.

It's absolutely wrong personally, and it's absolutely wrong logically. First of all, personally. I mean, the heart doesn't work that way. Imagine a group of families all of whom had one member with MS,  multiple sclerosis, a terrible, terrible disease. And imagine that they all had those members using,  taking a treatment using a particular medicine, the same medicine.

And what they found that most of the families found that their MS  member was cured. And what if some of the other families found that because of the medicine,  they were dramatically improved. And they got together and they began to compare notes and compare experiences  and study, and they came to the conclusion that this is the cure for MS. And the world needs to see it. So they create a foundation and they create platforms and they get the word out.

Now, how would you regard them? I think you would look at them and say, they may be right. They may be wrong. But there's nothing narrow about them saying, this is the cure. They may be right.

They may be wrong. But of course, if they think they have the cure and they've experienced it like that,  of course, they're going to do that. Now, you may think a couple of them are a little overbearing. Maybe they kind of come on kind of hard. But there's absolutely nothing wrong with the campaign.

There's nothing wrong with them wanting to do this and to come to the world  and say, this is the cure. Okay, well, why would Christians be any different? They aren't different except that they're more so. Because Christians don't just believe they have a cure for one disease. They believe they have something even more foundational.

And so they have to go to the world and say, this is the cure. And so you ought to say, well, they may be right or they may be wrong. And some of them may be overbearing. And by the way, a lot of Christians are overbearing. But there's nothing particularly narrow about it.

There's nothing narrow about it. It's absolutely natural. In the Atlantic Monthly, recently, there was an interesting article. It was actually quite a cool article on college atheists. In other words, people who've raised in the church go to college and become atheists.

The whole article about them. And there's this one line I want to or this one couple of sentences I want to read you. In it, there's this quote, quote,  without fail, former church attending students express similar feelings to Michael,  a polypsych major at Dartmouth who said, quote,  I really can't consider a Christian, a good moral person if he isn't trying to convert me. See, now that's exactly right. Why?

If you're a Christian and you believe the claims of Jesus  and you really think that you've got this cure as it were,  then Michael's trying to say, if you're a good moral person,  you've got to be trying to convert me. Oh, I'm sure he doesn't want this to be overbearing. He doesn't want Christians to be, you know, uncivil, you know, I don't know that stuff. But he's trying to say is, if you believe this, then you're not a good person  if you're not trying to convert me because you're not trying to convert me. You don't love me or you don't believe it.

But it's not just so to say, well, Christians can believe what they believe,  but they shouldn't try to convert people. They shouldn't try to say that their beliefs are better or brighter  than other people ought to abandon their beliefs and adopt you. You shouldn't do that. First of all, I try to show you personally that doesn't make sense,  but secondly, it doesn't logically make sense. I'm going to be brief about this, but it doesn't logically make sense.

To say, you must not say that your beliefs about spiritual reality are better than anybody else's. You know, all religions are equally important and right or valuable to the people. If it helps them, it helps them. You should say that your take on spiritual reality is better than anybody else's. Do you realize what you're doing?

At that very moment, you're doing the very thing you're telling other people they can't do. So, for example, there's a couple of ways to put it. If you say no one's faith position about the nature of spiritual reality is the superior one. But to say that is a faith position, you can't prove it scientifically,  and you're saying that it's superior. You're saying that the idea that all religions are equally right is superior  to the view that one religion is wrong.

Listen, if it's arrogant to say that one religion is right,  why is an arrogant to say one way of thinking about religions is right? Because what you're really trying to say is my thinking that all religions are right  is better than your thinking than only your religion is right. Which means, I think I'm right. And I think it would be better if you believe what I believe. And I think you should change your beliefs.

Uh-oh. You see, you can't avoid making truth claims. Exclusive truth claims. As soon as you say nobody should make a truth claim, that's a truth claim. As soon as you say nobody should say you shouldn't say your beliefs are righter than my beliefs.

But at that moment you're saying that your beliefs are righter than my beliefs. You can't overcome this. Now, as soon as you realize that everybody makes exclusive truth claims,  Christians are no different than anybody else. Everybody, therefore, has faith in things that they can't prove  and is trying to get other people to believe what they believe  because they think it'd be better for the world if you believe this way rather than this way. Everybody's doing that.

Now, okay, can I step out for a second and say some of you may conclude rightly  that I've had a lot of conversations like this in my lifetime, and I have. And let me just tell you that when you get to this place where the person who is saying,  oh, you know, Christians shouldn't be converting people and they shouldn't be public with their faith  and they shouldn't be telling them that they're other people are wrong. When I get into this place where I say you're doing the very thing you're telling me not to do  and they say, no, I'm not. And then you say, but you're doing it again. You're doing it again.

You're doing it again. At a certain point, they get a little frustrated, not with me, I'm sure. And they say something that I'm actually very sympathetic to. They say, but how are we going to have world peace then? If everybody's out there saying my religion is the right religion, we're going to have violence.

How are we going to have world peace? Okay, that's right, that's the problem. But for a moment, may I just ask you to do something with me? Actually, I'm going to play the age card on you, in fact, my age card. I'm old enough to remember when the people who are trying to blow us up literally,  were the communists.

They're the ones who were trying to blow us up. Therefore, and they were atheists. So the atheists were the enemies of freedom and democracy. And the religion, of course, is the friend of freedom and democracy. That's what it was in the 50s and 60s and all that when I was growing up.

But now we live in an era in which religious fundamentalists are trying to blow us up. Isn't that right? It's not the atheist anymore. It's religious fundamentalists. So now everybody says, the enemy of freedom and democracy is religious fundamentalism.

And of course, atheism now looks like it's free thinking and free. Could we please escape our cultural moment for a second and rise up, not grow up. Rise up and be objective for a minute. Religion is not the source of violence. And atheism is not the source of violence.

Because actually you have Pol Pot, Cambodia, killing fields, atheists, communists. You've got the crusades. No, no, no. It's human nature. That's the source of violence.

It's not religion or irreligion or atheism. It's human nature. And I can tell you what is not going to help human nature. What's not going to change human nature. Telling people don't make any truth claims when you actually are.

That's just irritating. If you think, if violence is coming from human nature and you think,  oh, the solution is, let's everybody get private. Nobody say that anybody is claiming to have the truth, which of course is the truth claim,  which doesn't work at all. It just frustrates everybody, furiates a lot of people. Well, then what are we going to do about human nature?

Ah. Point three. Look at Jesus. Look at His motivation. Jesus, of course, is pointing this woman away from her natural beliefs to new beliefs.

But look how He's doing it. See, the real question is not. The real question is not. How do we get people to stop making truth claims? Because you can't do that.

The real question is, whose truth claims are going to lead most to peace? Or whose view of things is going to produce in them the ability to speak respectfully and gently  and lovingly to people with whom they deeply differ? Do you hear that? Well, let's take a look. First of all, look at verse 27.

Just then is disciples returned and were surprised to find Him talking with a woman. But no one, why were they surprised? Do you know? This was a patriarchal society in which men did not speak to women in public usually. Why?

Because they were beneath. It was beneath them. This was also a racist society in which Jews saw Samaritans as half-breeds. Thirdly, this was a moralistic society. And a moralistic society in which here's a rabbi talking to a woman who's had five husbands and is living with a man  who probably came in midday to draw water and not come in the early in the morning to draw water with the other woman  because he was probably something of a social outcast.

Here's a man speaking to a woman. Here's a Jew speaking to a Samaritan. Here's a rabbi speaking to a fallen woman. And that just wasn't done, but he's doing it. And not only that, by the way, some commentators point out that a well was a pickup place.

And here's Jesus with a woman alone at the well and he's engaging her. And when the disciples come, they're amazed. And by the way, if you go up into the narrative in the early parts, she was also just as shocked that this guy would even talk to her. She was on the wrong side of every fence the world puts up. She was a moral outsider, a racial outsider.

She was a woman, not a man. She was Samaritan, not a Jew. She was immoral, not moral. And yet Jesus engages her. Why?

He doesn't care what anybody thinks. Why? There's basically there's two motivations for telling people you ought to change your beliefs. One is pride. I'm right and you're wrong.

The other is love. I want you to have what I have. And Jesus Christ is just filled with love. This isn't the way an arrogant, proud, self-righteous person operates. So he was that way he wouldn't be talking to her at all.

And so he is pointing her to eternal life and he is trying to change her beliefs. But so obviously out of love, how do we get that? If you could be open with who you are and be able to be public with your faith. But like that, then you'd be part of the solution in the world, right? That's what we need.

Not people that hide who they are. Not people that speak out in a way that's belligerent and that aggravates people. But a way that's true to who you are, but at the same time respectful and gentle. How do we get that? Here's how we get it, the way she got it.

Look at verse 29. Then leaving her jar, water jar, the woman went back to the town  and said to the people, come see a man who told me everything I ever did. Now look carefully. This is, you know, in small towns, everybody knows everything. So notice what she's saying.

She's not just saying, gosh, is he clairvoyant or something? Oh no. Oh no. What are you saying? There's a Jewish rabbi offering me the water of life  and he knows all about me.

He told me everything I ever did. Can you imagine her friend saying, he knows everything? Yes. He knows about Harry and Peter and Joe and, yes. And she said, he saw me to the bottom.

He saw me at my worst, but he was offering me the eternal life. You know, this is very weird. Here's a rabbi in Jesus. And he's offering her eternal life. He's offering her, remember what that water is?

He calls it the water that, if you drink it,  you'll never be thirsty again. What do you mean? It's soul satisfaction. And he is saying, though, you've been looking for it all the wrong places,  I can give it to you now. Now, as a Jewish rabbi, why wouldn't he say and said, well, look, you know, dear?

I know you mean well, but you know, you've had a really bad track record. And maybe what you need to do is I'd like to see you just sort of keep your nose clean  for six weeks, you know, pull your act together, you know,  straighten up and fly right for about six weeks, come back and we have a second appointment. And maybe then you'd be ready for the water of life. You know, maybe then you'd be, you know, worthy of it. No, no, no, no, no, no.

He sees her to the bottom and still offers. See, he saw everything I've ever done. He said, I don't care about your sexual history. Now, you know why Jesus can do that? He can offer us the water of life free, even though we don't deserve it.

Because on the cross, he said, I thirst. When he was up on the cross at one of the things he cries out, I thirst. Was he just physically thirsty? Probably not. He was being separated from God.

His soul was shriveling up. He was experiencing what we deserve to experience because we don't live the life we should. But because Jesus Christ went onto the cross and took our sins,  and took the punishment we deserve so that when we believe in him,  God can accept us and he can give us the water of life freely. That's grace and you know that changes your identity. What do I mean by that?

Sociologists talk to say, in fact, some social theorists actually say,  that everybody has their identity based on difference. That is, I feel good about myself because I'm not like them. I feel good about myself because I'm not like them. You know that the old prayer that Jewish men prayed centuries ago,  you get up in the morning and say, oh Lord, I thank you that you didn't make me a slave,  a gentile or a woman. I got self-esteem because I'm not a woman because I'm not a slave because I'm not a gentile.

What is that? That's pretty obvious. And yet, you know, that is an identity based on difference. In other words, I'm better than you. And honestly, even though it's not usually that overt,  when people say, I have traditional values.

And somebody else over there says, well, I'm a progressive open minded person. Somebody else says, well, I am a religious moral person. Somebody else says, well, I'm a free thinker. You can just tell the background is, I'm not like them. And if you belong to any other religion of Christianity  or if you actually think you're a Christian and pretty much don't understand the gospel,  which is true of many, many people,  you believe that you have a relationship with God because you're a good person,  because you've tried hard, because you're moral.

And therefore, when you meet somebody who doesn't believe in God,  you can assume that you're better than they are. And then your motivation for sharing your faith publicly is one of pride and arrogance,  and you just like telling people they're wrong. What if your salvation was not achieved but received? What if it comes in unmerited? What if your self-esteem is based on a gift?

What if your salvation comes not because you're better,  but because you have admitted that you're not better than anybody else,  and that you need great salvation? And you know your loved, despite your bad record,  that creates a new kind of identity,  a new kind of identity so that when you talk to someone,  if you know you're saved by grace,  not because you're better, not because you're wiser,  and you talk to somebody who doesn't believe, doesn't have salvation,  you would never assume that person you're necessarily better than they are,  because you're not saved because you're better. They might be better. They probably are better. They're probably wiser in some way or more self-controlled in some way.

Maybe a better husband, a better wife, a better father,  a better mother than you, why not? Because you're not saved by being a good father, a good mother,  a wise person. No, no, no. All the superiority is gone. You have a different kind of identity.

And because you have a different kind of identity,  because you've seen that Jesus has died on the cross for you,  because you see that because he said I thirst,  you can get the water of life freely,  you become part of the solution. You become someone who can talk about your faith out of love,  but without the haughtiness, without the self-righteousness. Look at this. She was able to say to her,  I don't care about your sexual history. I don't care if you're a hitman for the mob.

I can offer you this water of life because I said I thirst. And she goes back to her friends and said,  he saw me at my worst and loved me. I've never met a man like this. Come see this man. He saw me to the bottom, but loved me to the skies.

You know, she was a great witness  and she didn't know much about Christianity really. You and I know a lot more. What is our excuse? Let's pray. So Father, thank you so much for eternal life.

It comes to us through the thirst, the cosmic thirst,  the death of Jesus Christ. We do want to be part of the solution. We live in a pluralistic society. We desperately need people who know how to share who they are,  that is disarming, respectful, loving, brave. And we pray, Father, you would make us that,  those kinds of people.

Thank you for giving this to us through the grace of Jesus Christ  who came not to be served, but to serve,  and to give his life a ransom for many. His name we pray. Amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

Welcome to Gospel and Life. How do we share what it means to truly know Jesus? Not just as a historical figure or moral teacher,  but as Savior and King. This month, Tim Keller explores what the Bible shows us  about being public with our faith  and sharing the hope we have in Christ. Tonight's Scripture comes from a book of John.

Chapter 4, verses 27 through 42. Just then his disciples returned  and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, what do you want or why are you talking with her? Then, leaving her water jar,  the woman went back to the town and said to the people,  come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah that came out of the town  and made their way toward him?

Meanwhile, his disciples urged him,  rabbi eats something, but he said to them,  I have food to eat that you know nothing about. Then his disciples said to each other,  could someone have brought him food? My food, said Jesus,  is to do the will of him who sent me  and to finish his work. Don't you have a saying it's still four months until the harvest? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields.

They are ripe for harvest. Even now the one who reaps draws a wage  and harvest a crop for eternal life  so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together. Thus the saying one sows and another reeps is true. I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work  and you have reaped the benefits of their labor.

Many of the Samaritans from that town believed him  because of the woman's testimony he told me everything I ever did. So when the Samaritans came to him,  they urged him to stay with them  and he stayed two days. And because of his words, many more became believers. They said to the woman,  we no longer believe just because of what you said,  now we have heard for ourselves  and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world. The Word of the Lord.

We're beginning a new series called Public Faith. Sharing the hope that s within. We live in a very pluralistic society,  New York particularly. Your neighbor probably holds deeply sharply divergent beliefs  about things to your beliefs. Now in a situation like that,  pluralistic everybody s so different in their beliefs,  here s the question,  how can people be true to themselves  and not hide who they are and still get along?

I mean no matter who you are,  if you care about the social fabric,  that s a huge question to answer. Because there s really only three,  I think possible alternatives. Either you hide who you are  for fear that your neighbor will be angry at you  or you speak out about your beliefs and who you are  in such a way that you provoke anger in your neighbor  or you learn how to share who you are  and you are open about who you are,  but to do it in such a way that creates peace and civility  and of course the third alternative  is the only one that has integrity  and is the only one that really is,  it holds out a prospect of hope for a pluralistic society  and therefore even though we re going to be looking  at what the Bible says each week about how Christians  should be public with their faith,  this issue should concern everybody  and my goal is to show Christians  how they can be part of the solution. And that means whether you re a Christian  or whether you don t believe in Christianity  or whether you re not sure what you believe,  this will be of relevance to you. And we re all very excited about the fact that thousands  of people in not only the beta groups  but the small groups in our church  are studying this material every week  and applying it to real life.

Now the first week we re just looking at the very subject  of what public faith is and why faith should be public. And we re looking at what was read to you  was the last half of a great story about Jesus Christ  meeting a woman of Samaria at the well. It starts at the very beginning of chapter 4  and in a minute I re going to recount it  but what I want to do is look particularly at the  aftermath and that s here in verses 27 to 42. Immediately after speaking to this woman,  Jesus talks to his disciples  and he gets real metaphorical  and he talks about spiritual sewing,  seed and reaping. Now what is that?

What is he trying to get across in that metaphor? I want to delve into that and ask that question. What is he talking about there? And I like to look at that under three headings. Jesus here actually gives us a call to spiritual sewing of seed  and then he shows us in this passage  the method of doing it, how to do it,  and then thirdly the power or the inner motivation for doing it.

So the call to it,  the method of it, the power for it. Okay? Now let s first of all,  let s look at the call to spiritual sewing of seed. What is this? Let me give you the context.

What s happened right before this part? I told you that Jesus has had a very famous and very intriguing encounter  with a woman of Samaria at the well. Jesus has been traveling with his disciples  and as he s traveling through Samaria he stops at a well. His disciples go into town to get some food,  leaving him alone at the well. A woman also comes out from the town to draw water from the well  and they engage in a conversation.

And Jesus very gently and persistently tries to draw her out  and get her attention and he does it by using a metaphor,  an illustration. And he says, I have water that if you drank it,  you d never thirst again. And she says, really? All right? Let me have that water.

And he says, okay, you want the water? Go get your husband. She says, I don t have a husband. Right? He says, and very matter-facally, non-condemnally,  and gently says, you re right.

You don t have a husband. You ve had five husbands and the man you re living with right now is not your husband. Wait a minute. Why, when she said, give me this water of life, this water that satisfies,  so you never have to be thirsty again, give this water to me. And he says, go get your husband.

What is he doing? He s brilliantly showing her that he s not talking about physical water,  that he s talking about soul satisfaction, soul satiation,  the satisfaction of a soul thirst. And it s what she s been looking for and hoping to get that soul satisfaction  in men, in family, in romance, in sexual relationships,  and it hasn t happened to her. And now amazed with his insight, surprised at how much he knows about her,  impressed with how loving it is for him to be talking to woman in public,  and perhaps sensing a hidden power. And she calls him out, and she says, you know,  when Messiah comes, he will tell us about all these deep things.

And Jesus very dramatically says,  I, the one speaking to you, am he. And that is verse 26, that s the first 26 verses of chapter 4. And immediately upon him telling her this,  did disciples come back? See, verse 27, the disciples returned. She, verse 29, leased her water jug and goes into the town to start talking to her friends about what just happened to her,  and we ll get back to that in a second.

But in this context of him pointing her to eternal life and pointing her to belief in himself,  and then her going off and pointing the people of the town to him,  he gives this metaphor. He says, first of all, I have a food, this is now in verse 33,  he's using the kind of enigmatic, cryptic, metaphorical way that ancient sages would speak to the disciples  as a way of trying to get them to think, draw them out, focus their attention. And he says, I have a food,  and that food is to do the will of him who sent me into finishes work. Now right there, even that sentence all by itself is fascinating,  because he's actually saying, my meat and my drink,  that which gives me sustenance. The main thing I do is the work that God has given me, the one who sent me has given me this work.

Well, what is this work? Then he calls it harvesting or spiritual sowing and reaping. And the reason we know is spiritual, the reason we know that what he's talking about as a metaphor,  is because he talks about here in verse 36,  he says, we're talking about a crop of eternal life,  and therefore here's what he's saying, especially in context of,  he's talking metaphorically about what just happened with the woman,  and what's happening now between her and her friends. Spiritual sowing is pointing people to eternal life through Jesus Christ,  and spiritual reaping is seeing some of them believe. Spiritual sowing is pointing people to Jesus Christ and saying there is eternal life,  spiritual reaping is sometimes seeing them believe.

And Jesus makes a couple of amazing statements about this. First of all, he's telling his disciples, this is a, remember, this is food, what does that mean? That being public with your faith, pointing people to eternal life through Jesus Christ  is not dessert, it's not hors d'oeuvres, it's not optional, it's not a treat, it's not something special,  this is meat and drink, this is what you should be here to do,  and this is what God has put me here to do, and you should be doing it too. Not only does he show that how important it is to be public with faith,  telling people about eternal life through Jesus, but he even makes,  he bursts the boundaries of this metaphor when he says,  so that sower and the reaper may be glad together. Do you know how radical it is?

The reason it doesn't immediately hit you is because you are not farmers. Sowers go out, and months later reapers go out, right? He even mentions the fact that very often there's months between sowing and reaping. He says, ah, but when it comes to the gospel, the message of eternal life through Jesus Christ,  the sower and the reaper rejoiced together, what does that mean? There is no natural seed that's so powerful that the sower and the reaper can go out together.

You know what he's talking about? He's talking about the sower going out like this,  and the reaper can be right alongside and picking up, you know, the sower puts in the sea. Up it comes, the reaper takes, and they're working together. Sowers and reapers can never work together because there's no seed that powerful,  but the gospel is that powerful. So Jesus is saying, don't say this isn't the harvest time, lift up your eyes.

I'm here. Got it? This is really very, very strong. Never say this isn't the right cultural moment. Never say this isn't the time.

Never say, well, sharing faith publicly, that's something for certain people. No, it's meat and drink. It's for my disciples. It's the work I've been given to do. Don't say this isn't the time.

It is the time. And do you see the power so powerful that the spiritual sea, in this spiritual sea,  the sower and the reaper rejoice together? This does not mean, by the way, that everybody who hears the gospel believes immediately. It's not talking individualisticly. It's not just, you can see in the book of John,  you can see in your own life, that people come to faith in different stages.

But what he's saying is in the past, John the Baptist, the prophets,  they spoke enigmatically, vaguely about it, but now I'm here. It's clear the gospel message is here, and now it's got power. So today is the day of salvation. So that's the first thing we learn here. He's calling us the spiritual sowing in very powerful terms.

If you're his disciple, if you follow him. Well, that makes us a little bit nervous. What exactly is it that he's calling us to? What does this mean? So let's take a look.

What he's talking about metaphorically, the woman is doing right now. Look at what she's doing. It says, leaving her water jar, verse 29,  the woman went back to the town and said to the people, and these are people that she lives with,  these are people she knows. Come see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?

So they came out of the town and made their way toward him. There it is. Okay, how do we analyze this? What does this mean? First of all, please notice that she doesn't get up on a box and start preaching.

Now, to get up and preach to a group of people at once is fine, I do it myself. And as Jerry Seinfeld has said, nothing does anything wrong with that. But she doesn't do that because, of course, not everybody's called with that. That's not the essence of what Jesus is calling his disciples to do, to get up like this. Also notice she goes to people she knows.

She doesn't go grab strangers. Again, not that there's anything wrong with that. But that's still not the essence. And by the way, I don't care who you are. We'll get back to this in a minute, but you can already tell.

She has a kind of checkered sexual history. She is not a moral pillar of her community. But in every community, there's always a ladder. Even we Americans who love to say we're part of a egalitarian meritocratic society,  there's always pecking orders. There's always ladders.

You know, there's people above you in your career. There's people below you. There's people older than you, younger than you. People got more. The things you want, people who got less.

And therefore, it doesn't matter if you're high up on the ladder. Talking about your faith is scary. Why? Because you got a lot to lose. What about other people up there who are going to say,  what am I?

Are you a fanatic or something? If you're in the middle of the ladder, that's not easy either. Why? Because you don't want the people above you to think you're kind of... And they want...

They want them to be able to open doors for you, think well of you. But even if you're at the bottom of the ladder, like her,  you don't want to add insult to injury. I mean, you don't want people to say, look, we always knew  you're kind of a shady character. We know you're crazy, too. There's always something to lose.

But she goes, and she speaks. And she... And this one statement actually can be broken into two parts  to show us the essence of what it means to be publicly your faith. What it means to do this spiritual selling that Jesus calls all of us disciples to do. He says, come see a man who told me everything I ever did.

Now, the two essentials of this, of being publicly your faith are  simple transparency and pointing to Jesus himself. First of all, simple transparency. Look, what does she say? He told me everything I ever did. Now, look, this is...

She does not have a set of bullet points. There's not much theological content here. She's not explaining substitutionary atonement. She is just saying, here's what happened to me. She is simply being transparent about what's going on inside.

And this is the first thing you have to understand. Basically, being publicly your faith simply means not hiding your heart. Not hiding the wellsprings of your life. Not hiding from other people who you really are. If you just stop hiding and you're just natural  and letting people know how you make decisions,  how you deal with your problems, if you're a Christian,  you're just letting people see who you are,  and then it becomes very natural.

See, look, you don't necessarily talk to anybody about these things,  but a person doesn't have to be a dear friend for you to share three things. One is, do you ever talk to people about how you're dealing with a problem  or your stress is in your life? Do you ever say... Does anybody say I've been pretty stressed out lately? You know, and I've had a deal with it.

Do you ever talk to people about decisions you make? Do you ever talk to people about priorities that you set? Now, you can talk to people who are not necessarily your closest friends,  but when you are getting to know people,  you disclose a little bit more and a little bit more. And when you get to that level, if you're a Christian,  and you don't disclose the fact that Jesus is always part  of how you deal with your problems,  the Jesus is always part of how you make your decisions. If you get to the level where you can be disclosing that,  but you don't share that part of your heart,  you are short-circuiting the natural level of disclosure and transparency that happens  as you're getting to know somebody better.

So, in other words, public faith is just don't short-circuit it, don't hide it. Look, we all know that people don't want to hear it, especially in our culture. But the point is that it's unnatural, it's wrong. It's a lack of transparency. So, you don't have to learn a bunch of bullet points or get up on a box,  you just have to stop being dishonest about how you make your decisions  and how you deal with your issues.

Just don't hide. Just don't hide. That's the first thing, personal transparency. But the second thing, notice is this. She doesn't say, come to a seminar, come read a book,  she says, come see a man.

Now, I already said this. She doesn't understand too much about Jesus yet. I mean, she says he's the Messiah or he might be the Messiah, all right. But does she know he's going to die for her or for me and you? No.

Does she know he's going to rise from the dead? No. And those are really big things. She definitely doesn't know too much theology here. And yet somehow,  she has grasped the essence of the distinction between Christianity  and all of the religions.

She's actually grasped the genius of Christianity. What is that? Well, I would say that every other religion, the main thing in that religion,  is the way. The way. So, for example, the founder, the teacher, the prophet, the sage,  the founder of the religion comes and says, here's the five pillars.

Here's the eightfold path to enlightenment, the ten-nubbelchers. In other words, they're giving people the way. They're saying if you want to find God, if you want to find salvation,  if you want to connect to the divine, if you want to be enlightened,  if you want salvation, if you want favor with God,  if you want a relationship with God, here's the way. You do this and do this and do this and think about it. Buddhism has a very well laid out path.

Four noble truths and the last noble truth is the eightfold path. And do you have to know all about Buddha for the way to work? I mean, couldn't you find enlightenment without necessarily knowing that much about Buddha? Of course not. The answer is you don't need to know a lot about Buddha.

Why not? Because Buddha brought the way, but the main thing is the way. There's someone to touch from the person who brought it. The main thing is, since you're the one, through your efforts,  that they kick God's favor and get the relationship with God,  then the important thing is the way. It's the steps.

It's the plan. It's the formula. That's the important thing. Not the founder, not the prophet, but totally different in Christianity. In John 14, when someone says to Jesus,  Lord, you know the way.

Jesus says, I am the way. Lord, you have the words of truth. I am the truth. I am the way. I am the truth.

When Martha says to Jesus, Lord, my brother died, but he will rise again  at the resurrection on the last day. What does Jesus say? Martha, I am the resurrection in the life. I am the way. I am the truth.

I am the way. Why is he talking like that? Is he just being arrogant? No. Here's what he's saying.

I am the way means all of the religious tell you what to do to find God. I am God come to find you. All of the religious tell you what to do to find God. I have come to do what you couldn't do for yourself. I have come to give you salvation as a gift, see.

We always say the gospel changes everything and we believe it really does. That's why here at Gospel and Life, August is Go and Share Month. Throughout August, we're inviting thousands of our listeners to take a small step in sharing the gospel  with someone God has placed in your life. For those of you who make a gift to Gospel and Life this month,  we'll send you two copies of making sense of God by Tim Keller. It's a powerful resource that explores how Christianity makes emotional, cultural, and rational sense in today's world.

It's our thanks for your gift and provides a way you can do a small act to share the gospel  by reading the book with a friend giving one to a coworker or passing on both copies to people  who are exploring the Christian faith. It's a simple way to start a Gospel conversation or continue it. To request your two copies of making sense of God,  simply go to Gospel and Life.com slash give. Again, that's Gospel and Life.com slash give. Now, here's Dr.

Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. And therefore, every other religion, the teacher, the founder, that's not an important thing. What's really important is that you're good and that you do the thing. You follow the way. But in Christianity, it's all about Jesus.

Jesus is the one that you rely on. Jesus is the one. He's the way. He's the truth. He's the life.

People are constantly saying to me, over the years, so often I've heard people say,  look, I'm glad you're a Christian, that's great. But I believe that all good people can get to heaven. Let me repeat that just so you hear it and see the false assumption there. Oh, I'm glad you're a Christian. But I believe all good people can get to heaven.

What's the assumption? The assumption is that Christians think that their goodness gets them to heaven,  but they shouldn't be so narrow as to think that only Christians are good. But Christians don't believe that goodness gets them to heaven. In fact, the genius of Christianity, the heart of Christianity,  is we've stopped the exhausting activity of trying to depend on our own goodness. We've escaped the exhaustion of depending on our own goodness  and we're depending on Jesus' goodness, which means you can't talk about what's happening in your heart as a Christian  without talking about Jesus.

You can't avoid it. You have to be pointing to his beauty. You have to be pointing to him, and she understood that. And so there's the essence of what it means to be public with your faith. Just be transparent about what's going on in your heart,  but you must talk about, you must refer to, you must point to Jesus.

Now, this is New York City, and many of you who live here know  that the 18 minutes that I've just spent are completely offensive  to most New Yorkers. Because most New Yorkers say this,  it's all right for you as Christians to believe what you believe,  but you should not convert people. You should not tell people that Christianity is better or truer than their beliefs  and that they should change. You should not try to convert people. You should not say your beliefs are better or truer than theirs  and that they should change.

You mustn't do that. You've heard that statement before. Maybe you believe that. I want to show you for two reasons that that's absolutely wrong. That statement's absolutely wrong.

It's absolutely wrong personally, and it's absolutely wrong logically. First of all, personally. I mean, the heart doesn't work that way. Imagine a group of families all of whom had one member with MS,  multiple sclerosis, a terrible, terrible disease. And imagine that they all had those members using,  taking a treatment using a particular medicine, the same medicine.

And what they found that most of the families found that their MS  member was cured. And what if some of the other families found that because of the medicine,  they were dramatically improved. And they got together and they began to compare notes and compare experiences  and study, and they came to the conclusion that this is the cure for MS. And the world needs to see it. So they create a foundation and they create platforms and they get the word out.

Now, how would you regard them? I think you would look at them and say, they may be right. They may be wrong. But there's nothing narrow about them saying, this is the cure. They may be right.

They may be wrong. But of course, if they think they have the cure and they've experienced it like that,  of course, they're going to do that. Now, you may think a couple of them are a little overbearing. Maybe they kind of come on kind of hard. But there's absolutely nothing wrong with the campaign.

There's nothing wrong with them wanting to do this and to come to the world  and say, this is the cure. Okay, well, why would Christians be any different? They aren't different except that they're more so. Because Christians don't just believe they have a cure for one disease. They believe they have something even more foundational.

And so they have to go to the world and say, this is the cure. And so you ought to say, well, they may be right or they may be wrong. And some of them may be overbearing. And by the way, a lot of Christians are overbearing. But there's nothing particularly narrow about it.

There's nothing narrow about it. It's absolutely natural. In the Atlantic Monthly, recently, there was an interesting article. It was actually quite a cool article on college atheists. In other words, people who've raised in the church go to college and become atheists.

The whole article about them. And there's this one line I want to or this one couple of sentences I want to read you. In it, there's this quote, quote,  without fail, former church attending students express similar feelings to Michael,  a polypsych major at Dartmouth who said, quote,  I really can't consider a Christian, a good moral person if he isn't trying to convert me. See, now that's exactly right. Why?

If you're a Christian and you believe the claims of Jesus  and you really think that you've got this cure as it were,  then Michael's trying to say, if you're a good moral person,  you've got to be trying to convert me. Oh, I'm sure he doesn't want this to be overbearing. He doesn't want Christians to be, you know, uncivil, you know, I don't know that stuff. But he's trying to say is, if you believe this, then you're not a good person  if you're not trying to convert me because you're not trying to convert me. You don't love me or you don't believe it.

But it's not just so to say, well, Christians can believe what they believe,  but they shouldn't try to convert people. They shouldn't try to say that their beliefs are better or brighter  than other people ought to abandon their beliefs and adopt you. You shouldn't do that. First of all, I try to show you personally that doesn't make sense,  but secondly, it doesn't logically make sense. I'm going to be brief about this, but it doesn't logically make sense.

To say, you must not say that your beliefs about spiritual reality are better than anybody else's. You know, all religions are equally important and right or valuable to the people. If it helps them, it helps them. You should say that your take on spiritual reality is better than anybody else's. Do you realize what you're doing?

At that very moment, you're doing the very thing you're telling other people they can't do. So, for example, there's a couple of ways to put it. If you say no one's faith position about the nature of spiritual reality is the superior one. But to say that is a faith position, you can't prove it scientifically,  and you're saying that it's superior. You're saying that the idea that all religions are equally right is superior  to the view that one religion is wrong.

Listen, if it's arrogant to say that one religion is right,  why is an arrogant to say one way of thinking about religions is right? Because what you're really trying to say is my thinking that all religions are right  is better than your thinking than only your religion is right. Which means, I think I'm right. And I think it would be better if you believe what I believe. And I think you should change your beliefs.

Uh-oh. You see, you can't avoid making truth claims. Exclusive truth claims. As soon as you say nobody should make a truth claim, that's a truth claim. As soon as you say nobody should say you shouldn't say your beliefs are righter than my beliefs.

But at that moment you're saying that your beliefs are righter than my beliefs. You can't overcome this. Now, as soon as you realize that everybody makes exclusive truth claims,  Christians are no different than anybody else. Everybody, therefore, has faith in things that they can't prove  and is trying to get other people to believe what they believe  because they think it'd be better for the world if you believe this way rather than this way. Everybody's doing that.

Now, okay, can I step out for a second and say some of you may conclude rightly  that I've had a lot of conversations like this in my lifetime, and I have. And let me just tell you that when you get to this place where the person who is saying,  oh, you know, Christians shouldn't be converting people and they shouldn't be public with their faith  and they shouldn't be telling them that they're other people are wrong. When I get into this place where I say you're doing the very thing you're telling me not to do  and they say, no, I'm not. And then you say, but you're doing it again. You're doing it again.

You're doing it again. At a certain point, they get a little frustrated, not with me, I'm sure. And they say something that I'm actually very sympathetic to. They say, but how are we going to have world peace then? If everybody's out there saying my religion is the right religion, we're going to have violence.

How are we going to have world peace? Okay, that's right, that's the problem. But for a moment, may I just ask you to do something with me? Actually, I'm going to play the age card on you, in fact, my age card. I'm old enough to remember when the people who are trying to blow us up literally,  were the communists.

They're the ones who were trying to blow us up. Therefore, and they were atheists. So the atheists were the enemies of freedom and democracy. And the religion, of course, is the friend of freedom and democracy. That's what it was in the 50s and 60s and all that when I was growing up.

But now we live in an era in which religious fundamentalists are trying to blow us up. Isn't that right? It's not the atheist anymore. It's religious fundamentalists. So now everybody says, the enemy of freedom and democracy is religious fundamentalism.

And of course, atheism now looks like it's free thinking and free. Could we please escape our cultural moment for a second and rise up, not grow up. Rise up and be objective for a minute. Religion is not the source of violence. And atheism is not the source of violence.

Because actually you have Pol Pot, Cambodia, killing fields, atheists, communists. You've got the crusades. No, no, no. It's human nature. That's the source of violence.

It's not religion or irreligion or atheism. It's human nature. And I can tell you what is not going to help human nature. What's not going to change human nature. Telling people don't make any truth claims when you actually are.

That's just irritating. If you think, if violence is coming from human nature and you think,  oh, the solution is, let's everybody get private. Nobody say that anybody is claiming to have the truth, which of course is the truth claim,  which doesn't work at all. It just frustrates everybody, furiates a lot of people. Well, then what are we going to do about human nature?

Ah. Point three. Look at Jesus. Look at His motivation. Jesus, of course, is pointing this woman away from her natural beliefs to new beliefs.

But look how He's doing it. See, the real question is not. The real question is not. How do we get people to stop making truth claims? Because you can't do that.

The real question is, whose truth claims are going to lead most to peace? Or whose view of things is going to produce in them the ability to speak respectfully and gently  and lovingly to people with whom they deeply differ? Do you hear that? Well, let's take a look. First of all, look at verse 27.

Just then is disciples returned and were surprised to find Him talking with a woman. But no one, why were they surprised? Do you know? This was a patriarchal society in which men did not speak to women in public usually. Why?

Because they were beneath. It was beneath them. This was also a racist society in which Jews saw Samaritans as half-breeds. Thirdly, this was a moralistic society. And a moralistic society in which here's a rabbi talking to a woman who's had five husbands and is living with a man  who probably came in midday to draw water and not come in the early in the morning to draw water with the other woman  because he was probably something of a social outcast.

Here's a man speaking to a woman. Here's a Jew speaking to a Samaritan. Here's a rabbi speaking to a fallen woman. And that just wasn't done, but he's doing it. And not only that, by the way, some commentators point out that a well was a pickup place.

And here's Jesus with a woman alone at the well and he's engaging her. And when the disciples come, they're amazed. And by the way, if you go up into the narrative in the early parts, she was also just as shocked that this guy would even talk to her. She was on the wrong side of every fence the world puts up. She was a moral outsider, a racial outsider.

She was a woman, not a man. She was Samaritan, not a Jew. She was immoral, not moral. And yet Jesus engages her. Why?

He doesn't care what anybody thinks. Why? There's basically there's two motivations for telling people you ought to change your beliefs. One is pride. I'm right and you're wrong.

The other is love. I want you to have what I have. And Jesus Christ is just filled with love. This isn't the way an arrogant, proud, self-righteous person operates. So he was that way he wouldn't be talking to her at all.

And so he is pointing her to eternal life and he is trying to change her beliefs. But so obviously out of love, how do we get that? If you could be open with who you are and be able to be public with your faith. But like that, then you'd be part of the solution in the world, right? That's what we need.

Not people that hide who they are. Not people that speak out in a way that's belligerent and that aggravates people. But a way that's true to who you are, but at the same time respectful and gentle. How do we get that? Here's how we get it, the way she got it.

Look at verse 29. Then leaving her jar, water jar, the woman went back to the town  and said to the people, come see a man who told me everything I ever did. Now look carefully. This is, you know, in small towns, everybody knows everything. So notice what she's saying.

She's not just saying, gosh, is he clairvoyant or something? Oh no. Oh no. What are you saying? There's a Jewish rabbi offering me the water of life  and he knows all about me.

He told me everything I ever did. Can you imagine her friend saying, he knows everything? Yes. He knows about Harry and Peter and Joe and, yes. And she said, he saw me to the bottom.

He saw me at my worst, but he was offering me the eternal life. You know, this is very weird. Here's a rabbi in Jesus. And he's offering her eternal life. He's offering her, remember what that water is?

He calls it the water that, if you drink it,  you'll never be thirsty again. What do you mean? It's soul satisfaction. And he is saying, though, you've been looking for it all the wrong places,  I can give it to you now. Now, as a Jewish rabbi, why wouldn't he say and said, well, look, you know, dear?

I know you mean well, but you know, you've had a really bad track record. And maybe what you need to do is I'd like to see you just sort of keep your nose clean  for six weeks, you know, pull your act together, you know,  straighten up and fly right for about six weeks, come back and we have a second appointment. And maybe then you'd be ready for the water of life. You know, maybe then you'd be, you know, worthy of it. No, no, no, no, no, no.

He sees her to the bottom and still offers. See, he saw everything I've ever done. He said, I don't care about your sexual history. Now, you know why Jesus can do that? He can offer us the water of life free, even though we don't deserve it.

Because on the cross, he said, I thirst. When he was up on the cross at one of the things he cries out, I thirst. Was he just physically thirsty? Probably not. He was being separated from God.

His soul was shriveling up. He was experiencing what we deserve to experience because we don't live the life we should. But because Jesus Christ went onto the cross and took our sins,  and took the punishment we deserve so that when we believe in him,  God can accept us and he can give us the water of life freely. That's grace and you know that changes your identity. What do I mean by that?

Sociologists talk to say, in fact, some social theorists actually say,  that everybody has their identity based on difference. That is, I feel good about myself because I'm not like them. I feel good about myself because I'm not like them. You know that the old prayer that Jewish men prayed centuries ago,  you get up in the morning and say, oh Lord, I thank you that you didn't make me a slave,  a gentile or a woman. I got self-esteem because I'm not a woman because I'm not a slave because I'm not a gentile.

What is that? That's pretty obvious. And yet, you know, that is an identity based on difference. In other words, I'm better than you. And honestly, even though it's not usually that overt,  when people say, I have traditional values.

And somebody else over there says, well, I'm a progressive open minded person. Somebody else says, well, I am a religious moral person. Somebody else says, well, I'm a free thinker. You can just tell the background is, I'm not like them. And if you belong to any other religion of Christianity  or if you actually think you're a Christian and pretty much don't understand the gospel,  which is true of many, many people,  you believe that you have a relationship with God because you're a good person,  because you've tried hard, because you're moral.

And therefore, when you meet somebody who doesn't believe in God,  you can assume that you're better than they are. And then your motivation for sharing your faith publicly is one of pride and arrogance,  and you just like telling people they're wrong. What if your salvation was not achieved but received? What if it comes in unmerited? What if your self-esteem is based on a gift?

What if your salvation comes not because you're better,  but because you have admitted that you're not better than anybody else,  and that you need great salvation? And you know your loved, despite your bad record,  that creates a new kind of identity,  a new kind of identity so that when you talk to someone,  if you know you're saved by grace,  not because you're better, not because you're wiser,  and you talk to somebody who doesn't believe, doesn't have salvation,  you would never assume that person you're necessarily better than they are,  because you're not saved because you're better. They might be better. They probably are better. They're probably wiser in some way or more self-controlled in some way.

Maybe a better husband, a better wife, a better father,  a better mother than you, why not? Because you're not saved by being a good father, a good mother,  a wise person. No, no, no. All the superiority is gone. You have a different kind of identity.

And because you have a different kind of identity,  because you've seen that Jesus has died on the cross for you,  because you see that because he said I thirst,  you can get the water of life freely,  you become part of the solution. You become someone who can talk about your faith out of love,  but without the haughtiness, without the self-righteousness. Look at this. She was able to say to her,  I don't care about your sexual history. I don't care if you're a hitman for the mob.

I can offer you this water of life because I said I thirst. And she goes back to her friends and said,  he saw me at my worst and loved me. I've never met a man like this. Come see this man. He saw me to the bottom, but loved me to the skies.

You know, she was a great witness  and she didn't know much about Christianity really. You and I know a lot more. What is our excuse? Let's pray. So Father, thank you so much for eternal life.

It comes to us through the thirst, the cosmic thirst,  the death of Jesus Christ. We do want to be part of the solution. We live in a pluralistic society. We desperately need people who know how to share who they are,  that is disarming, respectful, loving, brave. And we pray, Father, you would make us that,  those kinds of people.

Thank you for giving this to us through the grace of Jesus Christ  who came not to be served, but to serve,  and to give his life a ransom for many. His name we pray. Amen.

欢迎收听 Gospel and Life。我们如何分享“真正认识耶稣”意味着什么？不仅把他当作历史人物或道德导师，而是当作救主和君王。本月，提姆·凯勒将带我们探讨：圣经如何教导我们在信仰上保持公开，分享我们在基督里所拥有的盼望。今晚的经文选自《约翰福音》。

第四章 27—42 节。正当那时，门徒回来了，惊讶地发现他在和一个女人说话；只是没有人问：“你要什么？”或“你为什么和她说话？”那女人就留下水罐，往城里去，对众人说：“你们来看！有一个人把我素来所行的一切都给我说出来了。莫非这就是基督吗？”众人就出城，往他那里去。

这其间，门徒对他说：“拉比，请吃。”他却说：“我有食物吃，是你们不知道的。”门徒就彼此说：“莫非有人拿什么给他吃吗？”耶稣说：“我的食物就是遵行差我来者的旨意，做成他的工。你们岂不说：‘再等四个月才到收割的时候’吗？我告诉你们：举目向田观看，庄稼已经熟了，可以收割了。收割的人得工价，积蓄五谷到永生，叫撒种的和收割的一同快乐。俗语说：‘那人撒种，这人收割’这话可见是真的。我差你们去收你们所没有劳苦的；别人劳苦，你们享受他们所劳苦的。”

那城里有好些撒玛利亚人因那女人作见证说“他把我素来所行的一切都给我说出来了”，就信了耶稣。于是撒玛利亚人来见耶稣，求他在他们那里住下，他便住了两天。因耶稣的话，信的人就更多了，便对那女人说：“现在我们信，不是因为你的话，是我们亲自听见了，知道这真是救世主。”这是主的话。

我们要开始一个新的系列，叫作“公共的信仰”（Public Faith）——“分享内在的盼望”。我们生活在一个极其多元的社会里，尤其是在纽约。你的邻居很可能在许多事情上抱持与你截然不同、甚至尖锐对立的信念。在这种情形下——人人都非常不同——问题是：人们如何既能忠于自己、不隐藏真实的自己，又还能彼此相处、和睦共处？

无论你是谁，只要你在意社会的结构与纽带，这都是一个巨大而必须回答的问题。因为我认为大致只有三种可能：要么你因为怕邻居生气，就把真实的自己藏起来；要么你公开表达你的信念与身份，却用一种会激起邻居怒气的方式；要么你学会既公开、坦然地做自己，又以一种能带来和平与文明的方式去分享。显然，第三种选择才是真正有诚实与完整性的，也是真正为多元社会带来盼望的。所以，尽管我们每周要查考圣经如何教导基督徒在信仰上公开，这个议题其实也应该让每个人都关心；而我的目标，是帮助基督徒学习如何成为解决方案的一部分。

这意味着：不论你是基督徒，还是你不信基督教，或者你不确定自己相信什么，这个系列都与你有关。我们也非常兴奋：不仅在“测试小组”（beta groups）里，在我们教会的各个小组里也有成千上万的人每周在学习这些内容，并把它应用在真实生活中。

第一周我们要看的只是“公共信仰”本身：它是什么？为什么信仰应当是公开的？我们所读的经文，是一个伟大故事的后半段：耶稣基督在井旁遇见撒玛利亚妇人。故事从第四章一开始就展开，待会我会简要回顾；但我想特别关注的是后续——也就是 27 到 42 节。耶稣与这女人交谈之后，随即转向门徒，用非常隐喻的方式谈到属灵的“撒种、种子与收割”。那到底是什么意思？

他在这个比喻里想传达什么？我想深入探究并提出这个问题：他在说什么？我想从三个角度来讲。这里耶稣实际上先呼召我们去做属灵的撒种；接着在这段经文里向我们展示方法——怎么做；第三，他说明做这事的能力或内在动力。

也就是：呼召、方法、动力。好，首先我们来看“属灵撒种的呼召”。这是什么？让我先给你背景。

在这一段之前发生了什么？我刚说过，耶稣在井旁与撒玛利亚妇人有一段非常有名、也非常耐人寻味的相遇。耶稣和门徒一同旅行，经过撒玛利亚时在一口井旁停下。门徒进城买食物，把他独自留在井旁。有一个女人也从城里出来打水，于是他们开始交谈。

耶稣非常温柔却也持续地引导她、吸引她的注意，他用一个隐喻、一个图像来做：他说：“我有水，你若喝了，就永远不渴。”她说：“真的吗？那给我吧。”他说：“好，你想要这水？去把你丈夫叫来。”她说：“我没有丈夫。”他就非常平实、不带定罪、也很温柔地说：“你说得对。你没有丈夫。你曾有五个丈夫，你现在同居的那个人也不是你的丈夫。”

等一下：她说“给我这生命的水，这能使人满足、再也不必口渴的水”，他为什么回应说“去把你丈夫叫来”？他是在极其巧妙地让她明白：他不是在说身体的水，而是在说灵魂的满足、灵魂的饱足——一种对灵魂之渴的满足。她一直在寻求这种满足，却把盼望寄托在男人、家庭、爱情、性关系上，但都没有得到。

她因他的洞察而震惊，因他对自己知道得如此多而意外，也因他在公共场合愿意与一个女人交谈而感到被尊重，甚至隐约察觉到一种隐藏的能力。于是她试探他说：“弥赛亚来了，他会把这些深奥的事告诉我们。”耶稣非常戏剧性地说：“我就是——正在对你说话的就是他。”这就是第 26 节；也就是第四章前 26 节的内容。

他这样告诉她之后，门徒立刻回来了吗？看第 27 节，门徒回来了。她在第 29 节留下水罐，进城去向朋友讲述刚发生在她身上的事，我们等会儿会再回到那里。

就在他指向永生、指向信靠他自己，而她又去指向城里的人来见他之际，耶稣提出这个比喻。首先他说：“我有一种食物”（第 33 节）。他用那种古代智者常用的、带着谜语般隐晦和象征的方式对门徒说话，为的是让他们思考、被引出来、集中注意力。他说：“我有食物；我的食物就是遵行差我来者的旨意，完成他的工。”

光这一句话就很耐人寻味，因为他是在说：“我的肉、我的饮料——使我得供应、得滋养的东西——就是去做神交给我的工作；差我来的那一位给了我这工作。”

那这工作是什么呢？接着他称之为“收割”，或属灵的撒种与收割。我们知道这是属灵的、是隐喻性的，因为他在第 36 节说：我们谈的是“积蓄五谷到永生”。因此，他的意思是：尤其结合上下文——他在用比喻解释刚才与那女人发生的事，以及她与朋友之间正在发生的事。

属灵的撒种，就是借着耶稣基督把人指向永生；属灵的收割，就是看见其中一些人相信。属灵的撒种，是指向耶稣基督、告诉人有永生；属灵的收割，是有时看见他们信。

耶稣关于这事说了几句令人惊讶的话。首先，他在告诉门徒：这是“食物”。这意味着什么？意味着在信仰上公开、把人指向借着耶稣基督得永生，并不是甜点，不是餐前小吃，不是可有可无的选项，不是“特别加码的事工”；这是肉与水，这是你们活着在这里该做的事。这是神把我放在这里要做的事，你们也该做。

他不仅说明公开信仰、向人讲述借着耶稣得永生是何等重要，甚至在他说“叫撒种的和收割的一同快乐”时，把这个比喻推到了极限。你知道这有多激进吗？你没有立刻被震撼，是因为你不是农夫。撒种的人出去，几个月后收割的人才出去，对吧？他还提到常常撒种与收割之间隔着几个月。但他说：在福音这件事上——借着耶稣基督得永生的信息——撒种的和收割的竟能一起欢喜。这是什么意思？

自然界没有任何一种种子强大到让撒种的人和收割的人可以同时出去。你知道他在说什么吗？他在说：撒种的人这样撒下去，收割的人可以紧挨着立刻收上来——撒下去，长出来，收上来；他们可以并肩工作。撒种与收割从来无法同时进行，因为没有那么强的种子；但福音就是那么有能力。

所以耶稣是在说：不要说“现在不是收割的时候”，要抬起眼睛看——我在这里。明白吗？这很强烈：不要说“现在不是合适的文化时刻”；不要说“现在不是时候”；不要说“公开分享信仰那是某些人的事”。不，这是肉与水，是给门徒的，是我受差遣要完成的工；不要说“不是时候”。现在就是时候。

并且你看到这能力之大：在这属灵的种子里，撒种的和收割的一同快乐。顺便说一句，这并不是说每个听见福音的人都会立刻相信；这不是在讲个人层面的一步到位。你从《约翰福音》里、也从自己生命里都能看到，人信主常常经历不同阶段。

但耶稣的意思是：过去，施洗约翰、众先知只是隐晦、模糊地提到；现在我来了，信息清楚了，福音临到，并且有能力了。今天就是拯救的日子。

这是我们在这里学到的第一件事：他用极其有力的方式呼召我们去做属灵的撒种。

如果你是他的门徒、你跟随他——这会让我们有点紧张：他到底呼召我们做什么？这意味着什么？我们来看看。

他在比喻里所说的，那女人正好就在做。看她在做什么：经文说她“留下水罐”（第 29 节），回城里对众人说——这些是她同住一城的人、她认识的人——“你们来看！有一个人把我素来所行的一切都给我说出来了。莫非这就是基督吗？”于是他们出城往他那里去。就是这样。

好，我们怎么分析？这意味着什么？首先请注意：她并没有站上箱子开始对一群人讲道。

当然，站起来对一群人讲道没有错——我自己也这么做。正如杰瑞·宋飞说的，那也没什么不对。但她没这么做，因为不是每个人都蒙召做那样的事；那也不是耶稣呼召门徒做的核心——不是叫你们都这样站出来。

也请注意：她去找的是她认识的人；她没有去拉陌生人。再次，这并不表示那样做有什么不对，但那仍不是核心。

顺便说一句，无论你是谁——我们稍后会再谈——你已经能看出：她的性史相当复杂。她不是社区里所谓的道德楷模。但任何群体里总有一把“梯子”。即便我们美国人喜欢说自己是平等、靠能力上升的社会，仍然总有等级、总有秩序。

你在职场上总有人在你之上，也总有人在你之下；有人比你年长，有人比你年轻；有人拥有你想要的，也有人比你少。因此，不管你在梯子高处还是低处，谈论信仰都很吓人。

如果你在梯子高处，为什么可怕？因为你失去的多：上面的人可能会说“你怎么回事？你是狂热分子吗？”

如果你在梯子中间，也不容易：因为你不想让上面的人觉得你……而你又希望他们能为你开门、对你有好印象。

但就算你在梯子底部，像她一样，也不想雪上加霜：你不想人家说“我们早就知道你这人不太正派，我们也知道你还疯了”。总有代价。

然而她还是去说了。

而她这一句话其实可以分成两部分，帮助我们抓住“公开信仰”的本质——也就是耶稣呼召所有门徒去做的属灵撒种到底是什么。她说：“你们来看！有一个人把我素来所行的一切都给我说出来了。”

公开信仰的两个要素是：简单的透明，以及指向耶稣本人。

第一，简单的透明。她说了什么？“他把我素来所行的一切都告诉我。”她并没有一套要点清单；这里也没有很多神学内容。她没有解释“代赎”之类的教义。她只是说：“这就是发生在我身上的事。”她只是坦诚自己内在发生了什么。

这是你必须明白的第一件事：所谓公开信仰，基本上就是不隐藏你的心——不隐藏你生命的泉源，不隐藏你真实是谁。如果你只是停止隐藏，变得自然，让人看见你如何做决定、如何处理问题；若你是基督徒，你只是让人看见你是谁，那么一切就会变得很自然。

你未必会对任何人谈这些，但一个人不必是你的挚友，你也会分享三类事情：第一，你会不会跟人谈你如何面对压力或生活里的问题？会不会说“我最近压力很大，我一直在处理它”？第二，你会不会跟人谈你做的决定？第三，你会不会跟人谈你设立的优先次序？

当你在认识一个人时，你会一点点多披露一些。到了那个层次，如果你是基督徒，而你却不披露“耶稣一直参与我如何处理问题、耶稣一直参与我如何做决定”这一部分——当你已经可以披露，却把这部分藏起来——你就在短路那种在人际关系加深时自然发生的披露与透明。

换句话说，公共信仰就是：不要短路它，不要隐藏它。我们都知道，尤其在我们的文化里，人们不想听这些。但关键是：如果你把它藏起来，这是不自然的，是不对的，是缺乏透明。你不必背一堆要点，也不必站上箱子讲道；你只要停止在“你如何做决定、如何处理你的处境”这件事上不诚实。

不要藏。不要藏。这是第一点：个人的透明。

第二点，请注意：她没有说“来参加一个讲座”，也没有说“来读一本书”，她说的是：“来看一个人。”

我已经说过：她对耶稣其实还不太了解。她说他是弥赛亚，或许是弥赛亚。但她知道他会为她、为你我而死吗？不知道。她知道他会从死里复活吗？不知道。这些都是极大的事。她这里确实几乎不懂什么神学。

然而不知怎么，她抓住了基督教与其他宗教之间差异的本质。她其实抓住了基督教的“天才之处”。那是什么？

我会说：在所有其他宗教里，最重要的是“道路”（the way）。也就是说：宗教的创始人、教师、先知、智者来对人说：“这就是五功（五大支柱）。”“这是通往觉悟的八正道。”“这是十条诫命……”换句话说，他们把道路给人。他们说：如果你想找到神、找到拯救、与神性连接、得启蒙、得救恩、得神的恩宠、与神建立关系——这里就是道路：你要这样做、那样做、再这样想。

佛教就有一套非常清晰的路径：四圣谛，最后一谛是八正道。你必须很了解佛陀这个人，才能让这条路有效吗？换句话说，你能不能在不怎么了解佛陀的情况下得到觉悟？当然可以。你不需要很了解佛陀。为什么？因为佛陀带来“道路”，但最重要的是道路本身。道路可以从带来它的人身上被剥离出来。最关键的是：既然是你靠自己的努力去争取神的恩宠、得到与神的关系，那么重要的就必然是步骤，是计划，是公式；不是创始人，不是先知。

但在基督教里完全不同。在《约翰福音》14 章，有人对耶稣说：“主啊，我们不知道路。”耶稣说：“我就是道路。”——“主啊，你有真理的话。”——“我就是真理。”他还说：“我就是生命。”

当马大对耶稣说：“主啊，我兄弟死了，但末日复活的时候他必复活。”耶稣怎么说？“马大，我就是复活和生命。”

“我就是道路。我就是真理。我就是生命。”他为什么这样说？他只是傲慢吗？不是。他的意思是：

“我就是道路”意味着：所有宗教都告诉你“你该做什么才能找到神”；而我乃是神来寻找你。所有宗教都告诉你做什么才能找到神；我来做你无法为自己做的事。我来把救恩当作礼物赐给你。

我们常说“福音改变一切”，我们也真的相信它会这样改变。这就是为什么在 Gospel and Life，八月是“去与分享”的月份（Go and Share Month）。整个八月，我们邀请成千上万的听众迈出一小步，向神放在你生命中的某个人分享福音。

这个月若你奉献支持 Gospel and Life，我们将寄给你提姆·凯勒的《认识神：为什么基督教在情感、文化与理性上都说得通》（Making Sense of God）两本。这是一本非常有力的资源，探讨基督教如何在当今世界在情感、文化和理性层面都合乎情理。

这是我们对你奉献的感谢，也为你提供一个小小的分享行动：你可以和朋友一起读这本书，把一本送给同事，或者把两本都转送给正在探索基督信仰的人。这是开始或延续福音对话的一个简单方式。

若要领取两本《认识神》，请访问 gospelandlife.com/give。再说一次：gospelandlife.com/give。

现在，请听凯勒博士继续今天的信息。

因此，在所有其他宗教里，教师、创始人并不是关键；真正关键的是你要足够好、你要去做那套事、你要走那条路。但在基督教里，一切都关乎耶稣。你倚靠的是耶稣。耶稣就是那一位——他是道路、真理、生命。

这些年来人们常对我说：“我很高兴你是基督徒，那很好；但我相信所有好人都能上天堂。”我再重复一遍，让你听清并看见其中的错误假设：“我很高兴你是基督徒；但我相信所有好人都能上天堂。”那个假设是什么？假设是：基督徒以为自己靠“自己的好”上天堂，因此不该狭隘到认为只有基督徒才是好人。

但基督徒并不相信“好”能把我们带上天堂。事实上，基督教的妙处、基督教的核心，是我们停止了那种令人筋疲力尽的努力——靠自己的好来撑起救恩。我们从倚靠自己的好所带来的耗竭中逃出来，转而倚靠耶稣的好。

这意味着：作为基督徒，你不可能谈你心里正在发生什么，却不谈到耶稣。你躲不开。你必须指向他的美；你必须指向他。她就明白这一点。

所以，这就是公开信仰的本质：你只是对你心里发生的事保持透明；但你必须谈到、必须提及、必须指向耶稣。

但这里是纽约市。你们许多人知道：我刚才讲的这 18 分钟，对大多数纽约人来说是非常冒犯的。因为很多纽约人会说：“你们基督徒信你们的没关系，但你们不该去改变别人。你们不该去劝人改宗。你们不该告诉别人‘基督教比他们的信念更好或更真’，并且他们应该改变。你们不该试图让人改信。你们不该说你们的信念比他们更好或更真，并且他们应该改变。你们不可以那样做。”

你一定听过这话。也许你就这么认为。我想从两个角度说明：这种说法完全错误——在个人层面是错的，在逻辑层面也是错的。

先说个人层面：人的心不是那样运作的。想象一群家庭，每家都有一位成员患有多发性硬化（MS），那是一种非常可怕的疾病。想象他们都让那位家人使用同一种治疗、服用同一种药。结果，大多数家庭发现他们的 MS 病人被治愈；另一些家庭发现病情也大大改善。

他们聚在一起，交流笔记、分享经历、研究之后，得出结论：这就是 MS 的治愈方法，世界需要知道。于是他们成立基金会、搭建平台、把消息传出去。

你会怎么看他们？我想你会说：他们可能对，也可能错；但他们宣称“这是治愈方法”，一点也不狭隘。他们可能对，可能错；当然也许其中有些人说话太强势、方式太咄咄逼人。但这项倡议本身并没有错。他们想这么做、来向世界说“这是治愈方法”，并没有错。

那么，基督徒有什么不同？其实没有不同，只是“更是如此”。因为基督徒不只是相信自己有治一种病的药；他们相信自己有更根本的东西。

所以他们也必然会对世界说：“这是治愈方法。”你也应当说：“他们可能对，也可能错；有些人可能太强势。”——顺便说，很多基督徒确实太强势——但这并不特别狭隘。这一点也不狭隘。这是完全自然的。

《大西洋月刊》最近有一篇有趣的文章，很酷，谈的是大学里的无神论者——也就是从小在教会长大，到了大学变成无神论的人。文章里有一句话（其实是两句）我想读给你听：

“毫无例外，曾经去教会的学生，都表达了与迈克尔相似的感受。迈克尔是达特茅斯的一位多心理学（polypsych）专业学生，他说：‘如果一个基督徒不试图让我改信，我真的无法把他当作一个良善、有道德的人。’”

这句话完全说对了。为什么？如果你是基督徒，你相信耶稣的宣称，并且你真的认为你有这“治愈方法”，那么迈克尔是在说：如果你是个良善、有道德的人，你就必须试图让我改信。我相信他不希望你咄咄逼人，不希望你不文明、不尊重等等。但他的意思是：如果你真信，你却不试图让我改变，那你要么不爱我，要么根本不信。

所以，说“基督徒可以信他们的，但他们不该劝人改宗；不该告诉人他们错了；不该说自己的信念更真更好；别人不该放弃自己的信念而接受你的”，这种说法不但在个人层面说不通，在逻辑层面也说不通。

我简要说明逻辑层面：如果你说“你不能说你对属灵现实的理解比别人的更好；所有宗教都同样重要、同样正确，或者至少对人都有价值，只要对他有帮助就行；你不能说你对属灵现实的理解比别人的更好”，你意识到你在做什么吗？你当下就在做你告诉别人不能做的事。

比如，你说：“没有任何人的信仰立场在属灵现实的本质上更优越。”但这本身就是一个信仰立场，你无法用科学证明；你却在说它更优越。你是在说“所有宗教都同样正确”这一观点，比“某个宗教是错的”更优越。

听着：如果说“只有一个宗教是对的”是傲慢，那么说“关于宗教的看法只有一种是对的”为什么不傲慢？因为你真正的意思是：我认为“所有宗教都对”这个想法，比你认为“只有我的宗教对”更好。这就等于：我认为我对；我认为你若相信我所信的会更好；我认为你应该改变你的信念。

糟了。你看见了吗？你无法避免提出真理宣称——排他性的真理宣称。你一说“没人该做真理宣称”，那就是一个真理宣称。你一说“你不该说你的信念比我的更对”，你就在说“你的信念不如我的更对”。你无法摆脱这一点。

一旦你明白每个人都在做排他性真理宣称，你就会知道：基督徒并不比别人更特殊。每个人都对一些无法证明的东西有信心，并且都在尝试让别人相信他们所相信的，因为他们认为世界若这样想会更好。人人都在这么做。

好，让我稍微跳出来说一句：你们有些人可能会（而且很正确地）得出结论：我这辈子跟人进行过很多这样的对话。是的，我确实有。

我也告诉你：当对方说“基督徒不该试图改变别人、不该公开信仰、不该告诉别人他们错了”，我说“你正在做你叫我别做的事”，对方说“我没有”，你说“可你又做了一次”，再说“你又做了”，到某个点，他们会有点沮丧（当然不是对我），然后他们会说一句我其实非常能理解的话：

“那我们怎么才能有世界和平？如果人人都说‘我的宗教才对’，那就会有暴力。我们怎么可能有世界和平？”

对，这就是问题。但请你跟我做一件事：我先打一下“年龄牌”——我的年龄牌。我老到记得：曾经那些真的想把我们炸掉的人，是共产主义者。他们才是想把我们炸掉的那群人；而他们是无神论者。

因此在那个时代，无神论者是自由与民主的敌人；宗教当然是自由与民主的朋友。那是五六十年代我成长时的氛围。

但如今我们活在一个宗教原教旨主义者试图把我们炸掉的时代，不是吗？现在不再是无神论者，而是宗教原教旨主义者。所以大家就说：自由与民主的敌人是宗教原教旨主义；而无神论看起来反而像自由思想。

我们能不能暂时跳出我们的文化时刻，稍微上升一点——不是“长大”，是“升高”——客观一点看？宗教不是暴力的根源；无神论也不是暴力的根源。

因为确实有波尔布特、柬埔寨“杀戮战场”——无神论、共产主义；也有十字军东征。不是，不是。暴力的根源是人性。

不是宗教或无宗教、不是有神或无神，而是人性。

我可以告诉你什么不会帮助改变人性：对人说“不要做真理宣称”，而你自己却正在做。那只会惹人烦。

如果暴力来自人性，而你以为解决方案是“让每个人都变得私密，不要声称自己有真理”，而这本身就是一个真理宣称——那根本行不通。它只会让所有人更挫败，甚至激怒很多人。

那我们该怎么办？

第三点：看耶稣。看他的动机。

当然，耶稣是在把这女人从她原本的信念带向新的信念。但看他是怎么做的。真正的问题不是“如何让人停止提出真理宣称”，因为那不可能。真正的问题是：谁的真理宣称最能带来和平？或者说，哪一种世界观能使人有能力以尊重、温柔、充满爱的方式，对那些与自己深深不同的人说话？听见了吗？

我们来看。

首先看第 27 节：“门徒回来了，惊讶地发现他在和一个女人说话。”他们为什么惊讶？你知道吗？那是一个父权社会，男人通常不在公共场合与女人交谈。为什么？因为女人被视为低一等，和她们说话是“掉价”的。

这也是一个种族主义的社会，犹太人把撒玛利亚人看作杂种。

第三，这是一个道德主义的社会：一个拉比在跟一个有五个丈夫、如今同居的女人说话。她很可能是正午来打水，而不是清晨与其他女人一起打水，因为她大概是某种社会边缘人。

一个男人在和一个女人说话；一个犹太人在和一个撒玛利亚人说话；一个拉比在和一个“堕落的女人”说话。这是不该发生的，但他却在做。

而且顺便说，有些注释家指出：井旁也是“搭讪”的地方。耶稣在井旁与一个女人单独相处并与她交谈；门徒回来时就更震惊了。

如果你往前看叙事开头，她同样震惊：这个人居然愿意跟她说话。她站在世界所有围栏的错误一侧：道德的局外人、种族的局外人；她是女人不是男人；她是撒玛利亚人不是犹太人；她被看作不道德，而不是道德。

耶稣却与她接触。为什么？

基本上，劝人改变信念只有两种动机：一种是骄傲——“我对，你错”；另一种是爱——“我想要你拥有我所拥有的”。耶稣基督充满的显然是爱。

这不是一个傲慢、自义的人会有的做法；如果他是那样，他根本不会跟她说话。所以，他在指向永生，在尝试改变她的信念；但那明显是出于爱。

我们如何也能这样：既能公开信仰，又能做到那样？那你就会成为世界的解决方案之一，对吧？我们需要的不是隐藏的人；也不是以好斗方式开口、惹人反感的人；而是既忠于自己、又同时尊重温柔的人。我们怎么得到那样的能力？方法就在这里：像她得到的一样。

看第 29 节：她回城里对众人说：“你们来看！有一个人把我素来所行的一切都给我说出来了。”注意仔细看。在小城镇里，人人都知道人人的事。她不是在说“哇，他是通灵的吗？”不是。她在说什么？

“有一个犹太拉比向我提供生命的水，而他知道我的一切。他把我素来所行的一切都告诉我。”你能想象她朋友说：“他知道一切？”她说：“是的。他知道哈利、彼得、乔……他都知道。”她在说：“他看穿我到最底层。他看见我最糟的样子，但他仍在向我提供永生。”

这非常奇怪：一个拉比，一个犹太人，在给她永生。他给她的是什么？记得那水是什么吗？是“你若喝了就永不再渴”的水——也就是灵魂的满足。耶稣在说：“你一直在错误的地方寻找满足；我现在可以给你。”

作为一个犹太拉比，他为什么不对她说：“亲爱的，我知道你是好意，但你过往记录太糟了。也许你该先保持清白六周，振作起来，收拾自己，端正生活六周，再来，我们第二次见面；到那时你也许就配得生命的水了。”他为什么不这样说？

他没有。他看见她到底，却仍然向她提供。

他看见“我所做的一切”，仍然说：“我不在乎你的性史；我仍向你提供生命的水。”

你知道耶稣为何能这样吗？他能把生命的水白白给我们，尽管我们不配，因为在十字架上他喊着说：“我渴了。”当他被钉在十字架上，其中一句呼喊就是“我渴了”。他只是身体口渴吗？也许不止。他正与神隔绝。

他的灵魂在枯萎。他在经历我们本该经历的事，因为我们没有活出我们该活的生命。

但因为耶稣基督上了十字架，担当我们的罪，承担我们应得的刑罚，以致当我们信靠他时，神就能接纳我们，并把生命的水白白赐给我们。这就是恩典。

你知道这会改变你的身份认同。我什么意思？

社会学家、一些社会理论家说：人人的身份认同都建立在“差异”之上——我之所以感觉良好，是因为我不像他们；我之所以有自尊，是因为我不是他们。

你知道犹太男人几个世纪前早晨会祷告：“主啊，我感谢你没有把我造作奴隶、外邦人或女人。”我有自尊，因为我不是女人、不是奴隶、不是外邦人。

这是什么？这很明显：一种建立在差异上的身份认同——也就是“我比你强”。

老实说，即便它没有那么露骨，当人说“我有传统价值”，另一个人说“我很进步、很开放”，另一个说“我是有宗教、有道德的人”，另一个说“我是独立思考者”——你都能听出背景音是：我不像他们。

如果你属于任何不是基督教的宗教，或者你自以为是基督徒却其实并不理解福音（很多很多人都是如此），你会相信：你与神有关系是因为你是个好人，因为你努力过，因为你有道德。

因此，当你遇到一个不信神的人，你就会暗暗认为自己比他强。那你公开分享信仰的动机就会变成骄傲与傲慢——你只喜欢告诉别人他们错了。

但如果你的救恩不是“赚来的”，而是“领受的”呢？如果它是不配得的恩赐呢？如果你的自尊建立在礼物之上呢？如果你与神的关系不是因为你更好，而是因为你承认自己并不比任何人更好，并且你需要极大的拯救呢？如果你知道自己尽管记录糟糕却仍被爱——这会带来一种新的身份认同。

这样，当你与人谈话时，如果你知道自己是因恩典得救，不是因为更好，不是因为更聪明；当你和一个不信的人交谈时，你就绝不会假设自己一定比他更好——因为你得救不是因为你更好。

他可能更好；他很可能更好。他可能在某些方面更有智慧、更能自律；也许是更好的丈夫、更好的妻子、更好的父亲、更好的母亲——为什么不可能？因为你不是靠做个好父亲、好母亲、聪明人得救的。

所有的优越感都消失了。你的身份认同变了。

因为你看见耶稣在十字架上为你死；因为你明白他喊“我渴了”，你才得以白白领受生命的水；你就成为解决方案的一部分。你就能出于爱谈论你的信仰，而没有傲慢，没有自义。

看这女人：她能对朋友说：“他不在乎我的性史。就算你是黑帮雇来的杀手，他也能给你生命的水——因为他喊过‘我渴了’。”她回到朋友那里说：“他看见我最糟的样子，却仍然爱我。我从未遇见过这样的人。你们来看这个人。 他把我看穿到底，却仍爱我到天上。”

你知道吗？她是个极好的见证人，可她其实并不太懂基督信仰。你我知道得多得多。那我们的借口是什么？

我们来祷告。

天父，我们感谢你赐下永生；这永生借着耶稣基督的渴——那宇宙性的干渴、那死亡——临到我们。我们确实渴望成为解决方案的一部分。我们生活在多元社会里；我们迫切需要这样的人：懂得分享真实的自己，令人卸下防备，尊重、充满爱，也勇敢。

父啊，我们祈求你塑造我们成为这样的人。

感谢你借着耶稣基督的恩典把这一切赐给我们；他来不是要受人的服事，乃是要服事人，并且舍命作多人的赎价。我们奉他的名祷告。阿们。

欢迎来到“福音与生命”。我们如何分享真正认识耶稣意味着什么？不是只把他当作历史人物或道德教师，而是把他当作救主和君王。本月，提姆·凯勒将带我们探讨圣经向我们展示的：如何在公众面前持守我们的信仰，并与人分享我们在基督里所拥有的盼望。今晚的经文出自《约翰福音》。

第四章，二十七节到四十二节。正在那时，门徒回来了，见他正和一个妇人说话，就感到惊讶；只是没有人说：“你要什么？”或说：“你为什么和她说话？”那妇人就留下水罐子，往城里去，对众人说：“你们来看！有一个人把我素来所行的一切事都给我说出来了。莫非这就是基督吗？”众人就出城，往耶稣那里去。

这其间，门徒劝他说：“拉比，请吃。”他却对他们说：“我有食物吃，是你们不知道的。”门徒就彼此说：“难道有人拿什么给他吃吗？”耶稣说：“我的食物就是遵行差我来者的旨意，做成他的工。你们不是说：‘到收割的时候还有四个月’吗？我告诉你们，你们举目向田观看，庄稼已经熟了，可以收割了。

收割的人现今得工价，积蓄五谷到永生，叫撒种的和收割的一同快乐。俗语说：‘那人撒种，这人收割’，这话可见是真的。我差你们去收你们所没有劳苦的；别人劳苦，你们享受他们所劳苦的。”

那城里有好些撒马利亚人因为那妇人作见证说：“他把我素来所行的一切事都给我说出来了”，就信了耶稣。于是撒马利亚人来见耶稣，求他在他们那里住下，他就在那里住了两天。因耶稣的话，信的人就更多了。他们对那妇人说：“现在我们信，不是因为你说的；是我们亲自听见了，知道这真是救世主。”这是主的话。

我们开始一个新的系列，叫“公共信仰”——分享那在我们里面的盼望。我们生活在一个非常多元的社会里，尤其是在纽约。你的邻居很可能在许多事情上持有深刻而尖锐、与你截然不同的信念。

在那样一种处境里——多元、各人信仰差异巨大——问题就在这里：人们怎样才能既忠于自己，不隐藏真实的自己，同时又能彼此相处、和睦共处？

我的意思是，不管你是谁，只要你在意社会的肌理与连结，这都是一个必须回答的大问题。因为我认为真正只有三种可能的选择：要么你因为害怕邻居会对你生气，就把真实的自己藏起来；要么你把自己的信念和身份讲出来，却用一种会激起邻居怒气的方式；要么你学会分享你是谁——坦然、开放——但以一种能够带来和平与公民礼仪的方式去做。当然，第三种选择是唯一有完整性、唯一真正保有希望前景的道路，适用于多元社会。因此，尽管接下来每一周我们会一起查考圣经怎么说——基督徒该如何在公共空间公开他们的信仰——这个议题其实与每一个人都有关，而我的目标是向基督徒展示：他们可以怎样成为解决方案的一部分。也就是说，无论你是基督徒，还是不信基督教，或者你还不确定自己相信什么，这都与你息息相关。我们也都非常兴奋，因为不仅仅是试点小组（beta groups），我们教会的各个小组也有成千上万的人每周都在学习这些材料，并把它应用到真实生活里。

第一周，我们先只聚焦在“公共信仰”这个主题本身：什么是公共信仰？为什么信仰应当是公共的？我们要看的经文，刚才读给你们的，是一个伟大故事的后半段：耶稣基督在井旁与一位撒马利亚妇人相遇。故事从第4章一开始就展开，过一会儿我会把它简要复述一遍；但我现在特别想看的，是之后所发生的事——也就是这里第27到42节。在与这位妇人谈完之后，耶稣立刻转向门徒说话，他用了非常形象的比喻，谈到属灵的撒种、种子与收割。这到底是什么意思？

在这个比喻里，他想传达什么？我想深入探究，并提出这个问题。

他在这里到底在讲什么？我喜欢用三个标题来理解这一段：第一，耶稣在这里实际上呼召我们去做属灵的“撒种”；第二，在这段经文里他向我们展示了实行的方法——该怎么做；第三，做这件事的力量，或者说内在的动力。

所以：对它的呼召、对它的方法、对它的动力。好吗？那么首先，我们来看“属灵撒种”的呼召。这是什么？让我给你一点上下文。

就在这一段之前发生了什么？我告诉过你，耶稣曾在井旁与一位撒马利亚妇人有过一次非常著名、也非常耐人寻味的相遇。耶稣和门徒一起旅行；当他们经过撒马利亚时，他在一口井边停下。他的门徒进城去买食物，留下他独自一人在井旁。一位妇人也从城里出来，到井边打水，于是他们就开始交谈。

耶稣非常温柔、也很坚持地想把她引出来，吸引她的注意。他用的是一个比喻、一个形象的说明。他说：“我有一种水，你若喝了，就永远不再渴。”她说：“真的？好啊！把那水给我。”

他就说：“好，你想要这水吗？去把你丈夫叫来。”她说：“我没有丈夫。”对吧？他就非常平实、不带定罪、也很温柔地说：“你说得对。”

“你没有丈夫。你已经有过五个丈夫，而你现在同居的那个人并不是你的丈夫。”等一下——为什么当她说：“把这生命的水给我，这种能满足、使你再也不必口渴的水，给我吧。”他却说：“去叫你丈夫来”呢？

他在做什么？他是非常巧妙地让她看见：他讲的不是身体的水，而是灵魂的满足、灵魂的饱足，是对灵魂之渴的满足。而这正是她一直在寻找、一直盼望得到的——她以为可以在男人身上、在家庭里、在浪漫爱情里、在性的关系里得到那种灵魂的满足；但在她身上并没有发生。此时她因他的洞察力而震惊，惊讶于他对她了解得那么多，也被他的爱心所打动——一个男人竟在公众场合与一位妇人交谈——并且也许隐隐感觉到某种隐藏的

权能。她就当面质问他，说：你知道，等弥赛亚来了，他会把这些深奥的事都告诉我们。

耶稣非常戏剧性地说：“我，就是现在跟你说话的这位，就是他。”这就是第26节——也就是第4章前26节的内容。他一对她说出这句话，门徒就回来了。你看第27节：“门徒回来了。”她呢，第29节，把水罐撇下，就进城去，开始跟朋友们讲她刚刚经历的事——这一点我们等会儿再回来。

就在这样的处境里：他把她指向永生，指向对他本人的信心；而她又跑去把全城的人指向他。于是耶稣用了一个比喻。他先说：“我有食物”（这时是第33节）。他用的是古代智者常对门徒说话的那种含蓄、谜语般、象征性的方式，为的是让他们思考，把他们引出来，集中他们的注意力。他说：“我有食物；我的食物就是遵行差我来者的旨意，并且完成他的工。”光是这一句话就很耐人寻味，因为他其实是在说：我的肉、我的饮——也就是维持我生命的养分——我最主要做的，就是神交给我的工作；那差我来的，把这工作交给我。

那么，这工作是什么呢？他接着称之为“收割”，或者说属灵的撒种与收割。我们之所以知道这指的是属灵的事、是个比喻，是因为他在第36节说：我们在谈的是“永生的庄稼”。所以他的意思是——尤其放在当下的语境中：他是在用比喻谈刚才那位妇人所发生的事，以及现在她和她朋友们之间正在发生的事——属灵的撒种，就是借着耶稣基督把人指向永生；属灵的收割，就是看见其中一些人相信。属灵的撒种，就是把人指向耶稣基督，说那里有永生；属灵的收割，则是有时候看见他们信了。

而耶稣在这里对这件事作了几句令人惊叹的宣告。第一，他是在告诉门徒：这是一个——记得，这是……

——食物——这是什么意思？意思是：在信仰上公开、指引人借着耶稣基督得永生，这不是甜点，不是开胃小菜，不是可有可无的选项，不是一种“奖励”，也不是什么特别节目；这是主食和饮水，是你来这里应当做的事。
而这也是神把我放在这里要我做的事，你也应该这样做。

他不但表明：在信仰上公开、把借着耶稣得永生的消息告诉人，是何等重要；他甚至在一句话里把这个比喻的边界都冲破了——他说：叫撒种的和收割的可以一同欢乐。你知道这话有多激进吗？

你之所以没有立刻被震撼，是因为你不是农夫。撒种的人出去，几个月之后收割的人才出去，对吧？他甚至提到：撒种和收割之间常常隔着好几个月。他说：啊，但在福音的事上——借着耶稣基督得永生的信息——撒种的和收割的却一同欢喜。这是什么意思？没有哪一种自然界的种子有这么大的能力，能让撒种的人和收割的人同时出去。

你知道他在说什么吗？他在说：撒种的人这样出去，而收割的人可以就在旁边一路跟着捡；撒种的人把种子撒下去，立刻就长出来，收割的人就收下——他们像是一起在做工。
撒种的和收割的从来不可能一起做工，因为没有哪一种种子那么有力；但福音就有那样的能力。
所以耶稣是在说：不要说“现在还不是收割的时候”，要抬起你们的眼睛。

我就在这里。明白吗？这话真的非常、非常强烈。
永远不要说“这不是合适的文化时刻”。永远不要说“现在不是时候”。

也永远不要说：“公开分享信仰，那是某些人做的事。”不，这就是主食和饮水；这是给我的门徒的；这是我被交付要去做的工作。不要说“现在不是时候”。

现在就是时候。
你看到那种能力了吗？强大到一个地步，在这属灵的种子上，撒种的和收割的一同欢喜？
顺便说一句，这并不是说：每一个听见福音的人都会立刻相信。这不是在讲一种个人主义式的“当场见效”。你只要看《约翰福音》就知道，你……

你也能在自己的生命里看到，人们是在不同的阶段来到信仰里的。

但他所说的是：过去，施洗约翰、众先知都用一种含蓄、隐晦、模模糊糊的方式谈论这事；而如今我在这里了。福音的信息已经清楚地临到，而且现在带着能力。因此，今天就是拯救的日子。这就是我们在这里学到的第一件事：他用非常有力的措辞呼召我们去做属灵的撒种。

如果你是他的门徒，如果你跟随他——这就会让我们有点紧张。他到底在呼召我们做什么？这是什么意思？所以我们来看看。

他用比喻所讲的，正是这个女人此刻正在做的。看看她在做什么。经文说，她撇下水罐（第29节），那女人回到城里，对众人说——这些人是她一起生活的人，是她认识的人——“你们来看！有一个人把我素来所行的一切事都给我说出来了。莫非这就是基督吗？”

于是他们就出城，往他那里去。就在这儿。好，我们怎么分析？这意味着什么？首先，请注意，她并没有站到箱子上就开始讲道。

当然，站起来对一群人同时讲道没有问题，我自己也这么做。正如杰瑞·宋飞说的，那并没有什么不对。但她没有这么做，因为显然不是每个人都蒙召去做那种事。耶稣呼召门徒去做的“本质”，并不是要人都像这样站起来讲。也请注意，她去找的是她认识的人。

她并没有去拉陌生人来。再次强调，这也不是说那有什么不对，但那仍然不是“本质”。而且顺便说一句，不管你是谁——我们一会儿还会回到这一点——但你已经能看出来。

她的性经历相当复杂。她并不是她所在群体里的道德楷模。但在任何群体里，总有一把梯子。即便我们美国人喜欢说自己是一个平等、靠能力上升的社会，依然总有上下次序，总有“啄食顺序”，总有阶梯。

你知道的：在你的职业上，总有人在你之上，也总有人在你之下；有人比你年长，有人比你年轻；有人拥有更多——你想要的那些东西——也有人拥有更少。

因此，

不管你在这把“梯子”上爬得多高，谈论你的信仰都是件可怕的事。为什么？因为你有很多东西可能会失去。那上面别的人会怎么说呢？会说：你这算什么？

你是个狂热分子还是什么？如果你在梯子的中间，那也不容易。为什么？因为你不想让上面的人觉得你有点……而他们又希望……

你希望他们能为你开门、对你印象好。但即便你在梯子的最底层，像她一样，你也不想雪上加霜。我的意思是，你不想让人说：看吧，我们早就知道你这个人有点不靠谱。我们也知道你也疯疯癫癫的。总有东西可失去。

可她还是去了，而且她开口说了。她……而这一句话其实可以拆成两部分，好让我们看见：公开你的信仰的本质是什么；也就是耶稣呼召我们所有门徒去做的那种“属灵的推介”。她说：“你们来看，有一个人，把我素来所行的一切事都给我说出来了。”

公开你的信仰有两个关键要素：很简单——坦诚透明，以及把人指向耶稣本人。首先，是坦诚透明。你看，她说什么？“他把我一切所做的都告诉了我。”你再看，这……

她并没有准备一套要点清单。这里也没有多少神学内容。她没有在解释“代赎”。她只是说：这是发生在我身上的事。她只是把自己里面正在发生的事坦然说出来。

这就是你首先必须明白的：所谓公开你的信仰，基本上就是不再把你的心藏起来；不再把你生命的泉源遮掩起来；不再对别人隐藏真实的你是谁。你只要停止躲藏，就自然一点，让人知道你如何作决定、如何处理问题——如果你是基督徒——你只是让人看见你是谁，于是这就会变得很自然。

你看，你不一定会跟任何人谈这些事；但一个人也不必是你的挚友，你才会分享三件事。第一，你会不会跟别人聊：你是怎样在面对一个问题，或者你生命里的压力的？

你有没有说过……有人会说：“我最近压力挺大的，你知道的，我一直在想办法应付。”

你会不会跟别人谈你所做的决定？会不会谈你设定的优先次序？当然，你可以跟一些并不一定是你最亲密的朋友的人聊天；但当你在逐渐认识一个人的时候，你会一点一点多透露一些。等你到了那个层次——如果你是基督徒——而你却不透露这样一个事实：耶稣总是在你处理问题的方式里；耶稣总是在你做决定的过程里。你已经到了可以说这些的层次，却不把这部分心里的东西分享出来，你就是在“短路”那种随着彼此更熟悉而自然发生的敞开与透明。

所以，换句话说，“公开的信仰”就是：别把它短路掉，别把它藏起来。你看，我们都知道人们不想听，尤其在我们的文化里。但关键是：那样做是不自然的，是不对的，是缺乏透明度。你不需要背一堆要点，也不需要站到箱子上去演讲；你只需要停止在“我如何做决定、我如何处理自己的问题”这件事上不诚实。

就是不要隐藏。就是不要隐藏。这是第一点：个人的透明。但第二点，请注意：她没有说“来参加一个讲座”“来读一本书”，她说的是：“来看一个人。”

我前面已经说过：她对耶稣的认识还不算多。我的意思是，她说他是弥赛亚，或者他可能是弥赛亚，好吧。但她知道他将为她、为我、为你而死吗？不知道。

她知道他将从死里复活吗？不知道。而这些都是非常重大的事。她显然在这里并不懂多少神学；然而不知怎么，她抓住了基督教与所有宗教之间区别的要害。

她其实抓住了基督教的精妙之处。那是什么？我会说：在其他每一种宗教里，那宗教最核心的东西，是“道路”。道路。比如说，那宗教的创始人、老师、先知、智者——那个宗教的创立者来到……

然后他说：这就是五大支柱。

“这是通向觉悟的八正道，是十条‘努贝尔彻’。”换句话说，他们是在把道路告诉人。他们是在说：如果你想找到神，如果你想得着救恩，如果你想与神性相连，如果你想得着启迪，如果你想得救，如果你想蒙神喜悦，如果你想与神建立关系，这就是路。你要这样做、这样做、这样做，并且这样去思想。佛教把这条道路讲得非常清楚。

四圣谛，而最后一条圣谛就是八正道。那这条路要奏效，你必须对佛陀了解得一清二楚吗？我的意思是，你难道不能在不怎么了解佛陀的情况下找到觉悟吗？当然可以。答案是：你不需要对佛陀了解很多。

为什么？因为佛陀带来了这条路，但关键是这条路。把带来道路的人和道路本身分开来看，关键在于：既然是你要靠自己的努力去赢得神的眷顾、获得与神的关系，那么重要的就是这条路，就是这些步骤。

这是计划，是公式。这才是最重要的。不是创教者，不是先知。但在基督教里却完全不同。在《约翰福音》14章，当有人对耶稣说：“主啊，你知道那条路。”

耶稣说：“我就是道路。” “主啊，你有真理的话。” “我就是真理。我就是道路。我就是真理。”

当马大对耶稣说：“主啊，我兄弟死了，但他在末日复活的时候必会复活。”耶稣怎么说？“马大，我就是复活，我就是生命。我就是道路。我就是真理。”

“我就是道路。”他为什么要这样说？他只是傲慢吗？不是。他在说的是这个。

“我就是道路”的意思是：所有宗教都在告诉你该怎么做才能找到神；而我是神来寻找你。所有宗教都在告诉你该怎么做才能找到神；我来做你自己做不到的事。我来把救恩当作礼物赐给你，明白吗。

我们总是说福音改变一切，我们也相信它确实如此。这就是为什么在 Gospel and Life（福音与生命）这里，八月是“去与分享月”。整个八月，我们邀请成千上万的听众迈出一小步，去

向你生命中神所安排的人分享福音。这个月，凡是向 Gospel and Life 奉献的朋友，我们将寄给你两本提摩太·凯勒（Tim Keller）的《Making Sense of God》。这是一本很有力量的资源，探讨基督教如何在当今世界在情感、文化与理性层面都说得通。

这是我们对你奉献的感谢，也提供一种你可以做的小行动来分享福音：可以和一位朋友一起读这本书，送一本给同事，或把两本都转赠给正在探索基督信仰的人。这是一个很简单的方式，可以开启一段福音对话，或把已经开始的对话继续下去。要索取你的两本《Making Sense of God》，只要访问 GospelandLife.com/give。再说一遍：GospelandLife.com/give。现在，请听凯勒博士带来今天信息的余下部分。

凯勒博士：因此，在其他所有宗教里，老师、创始人并不是最重要的。真正重要的是你要做个好人，你要去做那些事——你要遵循那条道路。但在基督信仰里，一切都围绕着耶稣。

耶稣是你所倚靠的那一位。耶稣就是那一位。他就是道路、真理、生命。

多年来，人们不断对我说——我常常听见人说：“听着，我很高兴你是基督徒，这很好。但我相信所有好人都能上天堂。”我把这句话再重复一遍，好让你听清楚，也看见其中错误的假设：“哦，我很高兴你是基督徒。但我相信所有好人都能上天堂。”

这背后的假设是什么？假设是：基督徒以为自己的善行能让他们上天堂；但他们不该那么狭隘，以为只有基督徒才算好人。可基督徒并不相信“善行能让我们上天堂”。

事实上，基督信仰的精妙之处、基督信仰的核心就在于：我们停止了那种令人筋疲力尽、试图倚靠自己良善的活动。我们摆脱了倚靠自己良善所带来的疲惫，而是倚靠耶稣的良善。这意味着，作为基督徒，你不可能谈论你心里正在发生什么，却不谈到耶稣。

你躲不开的。你必须指向他的美善。你必须指向他，而她明白了。

就是这样。所以，这就是“在信仰上公开”的核心：坦诚你心里正在发生什么，但你必须谈到、必须提及、必须指向耶稣。

现在，这是纽约市。你们许多住在这里的人都知道，我刚才讲的这18分钟，对大多数纽约人来说是彻头彻尾的冒犯。因为多数纽约人会这么说：你们基督徒相信你们所信的没问题，但你们不应该去使人改宗。你们不应该告诉别人基督教比他们的信仰更好或更真，以至于他们应该改变。你们不应该试图使人改宗。你们不应该说你们的信念比他们的更好或更真，因此他们应该改变。

你们不可以这么做。你以前听过这种说法。也许你就相信这一点。我想从两个方面向你说明：这种说法是绝对错误的——完全错了。

它在个人层面上绝对错误，在逻辑层面上也绝对错误。先说个人层面。我的意思是，人心并不是那样运作的。想象有一群家庭，每个家庭都有一位成员患有 MS——多发性硬化症，一种非常非常可怕的疾病。并且想象他们都让这些患病的成员接受同一种治疗、使用同一种药。

结果发现，大多数家庭的那位 MS 患者被治愈了。又有一些家庭发现，因为这药，他们的情况大幅改善。于是他们聚在一起，开始互相对照记录、交流经历、一起研究，最后得出结论：这就是治疗 MS 的方法，而且世界需要知道它。于是他们成立基金会，搭建平台，把消息传出去。

那么，你会怎样看待他们？我想你会看着他们说：他们可能对，也可能错。但他们说“这就是治愈的方法”，一点也不狭隘。他们可能是对的。

他们也可能是错的。但当然，如果他们认为自己找到了治愈之道，并且亲身经历到这样的效果，他们当然会这么做。现在，你也许会觉得其中有几个人有点咄咄逼人，可能表达得太强势、太用力了。

但这个行动本身完全没有错。

他们想这么做、走向世界说“这就是治愈之道”，这没有错。好吧，那为什么基督徒会有什么不同呢？他们并没有不同，只是更是如此。因为基督徒不只是相信自己有一种药能治一种病；他们相信自己得到的是更根基、更基础的东西。

所以他们必须走向世界说：“这就是医治，这就是解药。”因此你理当会说：好吧，他们可能对，也可能错；其中有些人也许有点咄咄逼人。顺便说一句，很多基督徒确实很咄咄逼人。但这并没有什么特别“狭隘”的。

这并不狭隘，这是完全自然的。最近《大西洋月刊》有一篇很有意思的文章，其实写得挺酷，讲的是大学里的无神论者——也就是说，那些在教会里长大，上了大学就成了无神论者的人。

整篇文章都在讲他们。其中有一句——或者说有两句——我想读给你听。里面有一段引文，说：“毫无例外地，以前去教会的学生都表达出与迈克尔相似的感受。”迈克尔是达特茅斯学院的一个心理学专业学生，他说：“如果一个基督徒不试图来使我改信，我真的不能把他看作一个良善、有道德的人。”你看，这话说得完全正确。为什么？

如果你是基督徒，你相信耶稣的宣称，你真的认为自己得到了这‘解药’（可以这么说），那么迈克尔想表达的是：如果你是一个良善、有道德的人，你就必须努力来使我改信。哦，我当然相信他并不希望这变成咄咄逼人；他不希望基督徒无礼、不文明之类的——我也不知道怎么说。但他想说的是：如果你相信这些，却不试图来使我改信，那么你就不是个好人；因为你不试图来使我改信。要么你不爱我，要么你根本不信。

所以，这不仅仅是说：“好吧，基督徒可以相信他们所相信的，但他们不该去改变别人；他们不该试图劝人归信；他们不该说自己的信仰比别人的更好、更明亮，也不该说别人应当放弃自己的信仰、来接受你们的。”你不该这么做。首先，

总之，我想先在个人层面向你说明，那样并不合理；其次，从逻辑上也说不通。我会简要讲一下，但它在逻辑上确实站不住脚。

如果你说：你绝不可以说你对属灵现实的信念比别人的更好。你知道，所有宗教对人来说都同样重要、同样正确，或者至少同样有价值。只要对他们有帮助，就算有帮助。你应该说，你对属灵现实的理解并不比任何人更好。你意识到你在做什么吗？

就在你说这话的那一刻，你正在做的，正是你告诉别人不许做的事。举例来说，这里有几种表述方式：如果你说，关于属灵现实本质的各种信仰立场，没有哪一种是更优越的。但你这么说本身就是一种信仰立场，你无法用科学去证明它，而你却在说它更优越。你是在说“所有宗教都同样正确”这一观念，比“某一种宗教是错的”这种看法更优越。

听着，如果说“某一种宗教是对的”是傲慢的，那么为什么说“看待宗教的某一种方式是对的”就不傲慢呢？因为你真正想说的是：我这种“所有宗教都是对的”的想法，比你那种“只有你的宗教是对的”的想法更好。也就是说，我认为我对；我也认为，如果你相信我所相信的，会更好；我认为你应该改变你的信念。

糟了。你看，你无法避免提出真理宣称——排他性的真理宣称。你一说“没人该作真理宣称”，那本身就是一个真理宣称。你一说“没人该说：你不该说你的信念比我的更正确”。

可就在那一刻，你是在说你的信念比我的信念更正确。你绕不开这一点。现在，一旦你意识到每个人都会提出排他性的真理宣称，基督徒并不比任何人更特殊。于是，每个人都在相信一些自己无法证明的事，并且都在试图让别人也相信他们所相信的，因为他们认为，如果你按这种方式而不是那种方式去相信，这个世界会更好。每个人都在这么做。

那么，好吧，我能不能先插一句，说你们当中有些人可能会得出这样的结论

说来也算恰当：我这一生里确实进行过很多类似的对话。让我告诉你，当对方说：“哦，你知道，基督徒不该去劝人改宗；不该把信仰公开；不该告诉别人他们错了。”当我说“你正在做你叫我不要做的事”，他们就说：“不，我没有。”你再说：“可你又在做了，你又来一次。”

“你又在做了。”到某个时候，他们会有点沮丧——当然不是对我沮丧，我想——然后他们会说一句我其实很能理解、也很同情的话。他们说：“那我们怎么才能有世界和平呢？如果每个人都在外面说‘我的宗教才是对的’，那就会有暴力。”

“我们怎么才能有世界和平？”好，这没错，这就是问题所在。但请先跟我做一件事好吗？我得打出“年龄牌”——准确说，是我的年龄牌。我老到还记得：曾经那些真的想把我们炸掉的人，是共产主义者。

他们才是想把我们炸掉的那群人。因此——而且他们是无神论者。所以那时候人们认为：无神论者是自由与民主的敌人；而宗教，当然，是自由与民主的朋友。那就是我成长的五六十年代等那个时期的氛围。

但如今我们生活在一个宗教原教旨主义者想把我们炸掉的时代，对不对？不再是无神论者了，而是宗教原教旨主义者。所以现在大家都说：自由与民主的敌人是宗教原教旨主义。

于是无神论看起来反倒成了自由思想、成了自由。我们能不能先从当下的文化时刻里抽身一下，哪怕一秒钟？不是“长大”，是“升上去”——升起一点，从高处客观看一会儿。

宗教不是暴力的来源；无神论也不是暴力的来源。

因为你看，波尔布特、柬埔寨、“杀戮战场”——无神论者、共产主义者。你也有十字军东征。不，不，不。来源是人性。

人性才是暴力的来源。

不是宗教，也不是不信宗教，也不是无神论。

这是人的本性。我也可以告诉你，什么对人的本性没有帮助，什么也改变不了人的本性：当你自己其实就在作真理宣称的时候，却去告诉别人不要作任何真理宣称。

那只会让人觉得烦。你想想：如果暴力是出自人的本性，而你却认为，“哦，解决办法就是让大家都把信仰关到私域里；谁也别说自己拥有真理”，可这句话本身当然也是一种真理宣称——这根本行不通。它只会让每个人都挫败，还会激怒很多人。那么，我们要怎样面对人的本性呢？

啊，第三点：看耶稣。看祂的动机。耶稣当然是在把这个女人从她天然的信念引向新的信念。

但你看祂是怎么做的。真正的问题不是——真正的问题不是：我们怎样让人停止作真理宣称？因为你做不到。

真正的问题是：谁的真理宣称最能带来和平？或者说，谁的世界观能在他们里面产生一种能力，使他们能以尊重、温柔、爱心去对待那些与他们在深处强烈分歧的人？你听见了吗？那么，我们来看一看。首先，看第27节。

“就在这时，门徒回来，看见祂正同一个女人说话，就都稀奇。”但他们为什么稀奇？你知道吗？那是一个父权社会，通常男人不会在公共场合与女人说话。为什么？因为那样做有失身份——她们在他们之下。

那也是一个带着种族歧视的社会，犹太人把撒玛利亚人看作混血。第三，那还是一个道德主义的社会。在这样的道德主义社会里，一个拉比却在和一个有过五个丈夫、如今还与一个男人同居的女人说话——她很可能是正午来打水的，而不是清早和其他妇女一起打水，因为她大概在某种程度上是个社会弃民。

这是一个男人在对一个女人说话；这是一个犹太人在对一个撒玛利亚人说话；这是一个拉比在对一个“堕落的女人”说话。这些事本来都不会发生，但祂却在做。

而且，顺带一提，有些注释家指出，井边还是个“搭讪约会”的地方。

耶稣却在井旁与一个女人单独相处，并且与她交谈。当门徒……

她一来，他们就很惊讶。顺便说一句，如果你往前看这段叙事的开头部分，你会发现，她也同样震惊：这个人竟然会跟她说话。她站在这个世界竖起的每一道栅栏的“错误一边”。她在道德上是局外人，在种族上也是局外人。

她是女人，不是男人；她是撒玛利亚人，不是犹太人；她是不道德的，不是道德正直的。然而耶稣却与她交谈。为什么？

他不在乎别人怎么想。为什么？基本上，劝人“你应该改变你的信念”有两种动机：一种是骄傲——我对，你错。

另一种是爱——我希望你也能拥有我所拥有的。而耶稣基督里面充满了爱。这绝不是一个傲慢、自负、自以为义的人会有的作风。若他真是那样的人，他根本不会跟她说话。

所以，他是在指向永生，他是在试图改变她的信念。但这一切显然是出于爱。我们怎么才能得到这种生命状态？也就是说，你能坦然面对“你是谁”，并且能够在公共场合表明你的信仰；若是这样，你就会成为这个世界解决方案的一部分，对吧？这正是我们所需要的。

不是那些把自己藏起来的人；也不是那些用好斗的方式发声、惹人恼怒的人；而是既忠于你是谁，同时又尊重、温柔。我们怎么才能做到？方法在这里——就像她得到的一样。

看第29节：“那妇人就留下水罐，往城里去，对众人说：你们来看！有一个人将我素来所行的一切事都给我说出来了。”现在仔细看：你知道，在小镇上，人人都知道彼此的事。所以注意她在说什么。

她不是在说：“哇，他是不是会读心、会通灵什么的？”不，不。她在说什么呢？“有一位犹太拉比在向我提供生命的活水，而且他完全认识我。

他把我做过的一切都说出来了。”你能想象她的朋友说：“他什么都知道？”她说：“是的，他知道哈利、彼得、乔……是的。”她的意思是：“他把我看穿到底。

他看见了我最糟糕的样子，却仍然把永生给我。”你知道，这很不寻常：这里有一位拉比，就是耶稣，他在向她提供永生。他在向她提供——还记得那水象征什么吗？

他称之为

就是那水——你若喝了，就永远不渴。什么意思？就是灵魂得到满足。他在说：你一直在错误的地方寻找它，但我现在就能给你。

可是，作为一位犹太拉比，他为什么不这样说呢：

“嗯，你知道的，亲爱的，我知道你是好意。但你也知道，你的记录一直很糟糕。也许你需要做的是——我希望看到你至少六个星期好好检点自己，你知道，收拾收拾，振作起来，端正做人六个星期；然后再回来，我们再约第二次。也许到那时，你才配得上生命之水。也许到那时，你才算……够资格。”

不，不，不，不，不。

他把她看透到底，却仍然给出应许。你看，“他把我素来所行的一切都给我说出来了。”他等于在说：我不在乎你的性经历。

你知道耶稣为什么能这样吗？他能把生命之水白白赐给我们，尽管我们不配。

因为在十字架上，他说：“我渴了。”他被钉在十字架上时，其中一句呼喊就是“我渴了”。他只是身体口渴吗？大概不只是。他是在与上帝隔绝。

他的灵魂在枯萎。他正在经历我们本该经历的——因为我们没有活出我们应当活的生命。

但因为耶稣基督上了十字架，担当了我们的罪，承受了我们该受的刑罚，所以当我们信靠他时，上帝就能接纳我们，并且把生命之水白白赐下。

这就是恩典；而且你知道，这会改变你的身份。什么意思？

社会学家谈到——事实上，一些社会理论家甚至说，每个人的身份都建立在“差异”之上。也就是说：我之所以对自己感觉良好，是因为我不像他们；我之所以对自己感觉良好，是因为我不像他们。

你知道，几百年前犹太男人有一句晨祷：早晨起来说：“主啊，我感谢你没有使我成为奴隶、外邦人或女人。”我的自尊来自于：我不是女人、我不是奴隶、我不是外邦人。

这是什么？这再明显不过了。然而你知道，这就是一种建立在差异上的身份。在其他……

你们懂的，就是那种意思：我比你强。坦白说，即便通常不会这么直白，当人们说“我有传统价值观”的时候，

那边又有人说：“我是个进步、开明的人。”又有人说：“我是个有宗教信仰、讲道德的人。”还有人说：“我是个独立思考者。”你几乎都能感觉到背后的潜台词是：我不像他们。并且，如果你属于基督教以外的任何其他宗教，或者你自以为是基督徒、其实大体上并不明白福音——这在很多很多人身上都是真的——你就会相信：你之所以与上帝有关系，是因为你是个好人，因为你很努力，因为你有道德。

所以，当你遇到一个不信上帝的人时，你很容易就会以为自己比他更好。于是，你在公共场合分享信仰的动机，就成了骄傲和傲慢——你只是喜欢告诉别人他们错了。可如果你的救恩不是你“挣”来的，而是你“领受”来的呢？如果它是不配得的恩典临到你呢？如果你的自我价值感是建立在一份礼物之上呢？

如果你的救恩不是因为你更好，而是因为你承认：你并不比任何人更好，并且你需要极大的拯救呢？并且你知道，尽管你的记录很糟，你仍然被爱——这就会塑造一种新的身份，一种新的身份：当你和人交谈时，如果你知道自己是因恩典得救，不是因为你更好，不是因为你更聪明；当你对一个不信、没有救恩的人说话时，你绝不会以为自己就一定比他更好，因为你得救并不是因为你更好。也许他比你更好，很可能确实比你更好；也许在某方面更有智慧，或在某方面更有自制。

也许他是比你更好的丈夫、更好的妻子、更好的父亲、更好的母亲——为什么不可能？因为你不是靠做个好父亲、好母亲、聪明的人而得救的。不，不，不。一切优越感都消失了。你拥有的是另一种身份。

而正因为你有了另一种身份，
正因为你看见耶稣在十字架上为你而死，
正因为你看见他曾说：“我渴了”，

你就可以白白得着生命的水，于是你就成了答案的一部分。你成了那种能够出于爱来谈论自己信仰的人，却没有傲慢、没有自义。你看这个。她能对她说：我不在乎你的性史。我不在乎你是不是黑帮的杀手。

我能把这生命的水给你，因为我说了“我渴了”。她回到朋友那里说：他在我最糟的时候看见了我，却仍然爱我。我从没见过这样的男人。你们来看这个人。他看见我堕到谷底，却爱我到云端。

你知道，她是个很好的见证人，
而她其实并不怎么了解基督信仰。你我知道得更多。我们的借口是什么？让我们祷告。

天父，感谢你赐下永生。
它借着那干渴——那宇宙性的干渴——借着耶稣基督的死临到我们。我们也愿意成为答案的一部分。我们生活在一个多元的社会里。我们迫切需要那些懂得如何分享自己是谁的人，
那样做既能消除防备、又尊重人、又充满爱、又勇敢。我们祈求你，天父，使我们成为那样的人——成为这样的人。

感谢你藉着耶稣基督的恩典把这一切赐给我们；
他来不是要受人的服事，乃是要服事人，
并且舍命，作多人的赎价。我们奉他的名祷告。阿们。
