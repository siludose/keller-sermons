Welcome to Gospel and Life! How comfortable are you when it comes to being open about your faith? This month on the podcast, Tim Keller looks at what the Bible says about having a public  faith. He shows us what it looks like to be open about our faith in a pluralistic society, in a way  that creates civility and peace and meaningful dialogue with our neighbors. The Scripture reading is from Psalm chapter 73 verses 1 through 3 and 12 through 26.

Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart, but as for me, my feet  had almost slipped, I had nearly lost my foothold. For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. This is what the wicked are like, always free of care, they go on a massing wealth. Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure and have washed my hands and innocence. All day long I have been afflicted and every morning brings new punishments.

If I had spoken out like that, I would have betrayed your children. When I tried to understand all this, it troubled me deeply till I entered the sanctuary  of God, then I understood their final destiny. Surely you placed them on slippery ground, you cast them down to ruin. How suddenly are they destroyed, completely swept away by terrors. They are like a dream when one wakes, when you arise Lord, you will despise them as fantasies.

When my heart was greed and my spirit imbitered, I was senseless and ignorant, I was a brute  beast before you, yet I am always with you. You hold me by my right hand, you guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will take  me into glory. Whom have I in heaven but you, and earth has nothing I desire besides you. My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever. This is God's word.

So, we are in a series called public faith, sharing the hope that is within. We live in a society, Western society, that does not encourage people to be public about  their faith, their religious beliefs. We are told that it is a private thing we should not be talking about, but it is ironic  because our culture actually encourages us to be absolutely open and public about everything  else, everything else, including sexuality, because it is who we are. But there is nothing more fundamental to who you are than your religious beliefs than  your deepest faith beliefs, and therefore the challenge before us as a society is how can  we be honest about who we are, which means how can we be public about our faith beliefs,  and yet do so in such a way that is respectful and supports the peace. So we all have to learn that, and one of the things we are doing in this series is talking  about that.

Now, if we are going to become a mature society in which we are able to talk about faith,  we also have to be able to know how to talk about doubt. We don't get much help here from either religious people or secular people. Religious people tend to see doubt as a very bad thing, a terrible thing, and around many  religious people, it doesn't feel safe to express doubts. But on the other hand, many secular people, certainly in a place like New York City, many  people believe that perennial doubt, constant doubt, deep skepticism is the only sophisticated  and intellectually mature position. The Bible, however, doesn't look at doubt anywhere nearly as positive or as negative as  that.

The Bible doesn't say it is as positive as secular people do, or as negative as religious  people do. Because actually doubt is not so simplistic, it's not at all good, it's not all bad, and  only when you begin to see it in a nuanced way can doubt actually be something through  which we make progress. Now, in order to understand what the Bible says about that, we are going to look at this  very famous psalm, this very famous passage. We've read the beginning and the end of it, we left just for economy's sake, we left  out a certain part of the middle which I'll refer to. It's very, very rich, and it's the case study of one man's, his name was ASAF, the psalmist,  one man's experience of doubt, how he moved through that doubt to actually a higher level  of faith, and even though it may not exactly be the same, his circumstances may not exactly  be the same as yours.

Nevertheless, the basic principles of what the Bible says about doubt, and I actually  think what the Bible says about that is almost unique. I don't know if anywhere else to look, in which doubt is not so good and not so bad, but  this nuanced, multidimensional thing, there's no better place to find that biblical view  than here. So let's look in this passage at doubt under three headings. What is it? What causes it?

What transforms it? What is it? What causes it? What transforms it? So what is it?

The metaphor for doubt that's used is in verse two. Verse for me, my feet had almost slipped, I nearly lost my foothold. Now that's a great image. When you're losing your foothold, for a moment you've lost your balance, and when you've  lost your balance, you're experiencing a certain kind of a vertigo, a kind of disorientation,  you know, a certain dizziness. There's one of the Greek words in the New Testament for doubt, die-psychos, which means  dipsychos, which means two psyches, which basically means spiritual double vision.

If you have double vision, it means your eye is not giving your brain sufficient information  to know where to put your foot. And when you're not quite sure where to put the foot, there's an uncertainty, and that's  what doubt is. Spiritually, it's this uncertainty. You lose the certainty you might have had before, and that's doubt. Now, what do we learn right off the bat about doubt from the very introduction here in  the beginning?

The answer, first of all, we learn that anybody can have doubts. Because even though we don't know much about ASAP, we don't know who this, much about who  this guy is, the author of the Psalm, still he was an author of the scripture. That's a rather high level of spiritual attainment, don't you think? Here's somebody who wrote scripture, divinely inspired. And yet, here's a man who, in spite of his level of spiritual attainment, was filled with  doubts.

He said, I almost lost my foothold, which means I almost lost my faith hold. So anybody can have doubts. But the other thing we learn, almost immediately, just by the quick read through, is that doubt  can be a positive thing. Here you have doubts that are, that will, by the end of the book, and excuse me, by the  end of the Psalm, will have led to a higher level of faith, and some of the most famous  affirmations, my flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and  my portion forever. In other words, there's been progress here.

Now the idea of faith leading, pardon me, of doubt and questioning leading to progress  shouldn't be all that strange. Francis Bacon, who was one of the first modern scientists, a couple hundred years ago,  he was one of the early modern scientists, has a place where he says, and he's kind of  overstating it a bit, but he's right. If you begin with certainties, you will end in doubts. If you begin with doubts, you end in certainty. And what he's really saying is, as a scientist, he says, if you look at what right now is  accepted by people, if you don't question that, if you just accept everything that is  told you, you'll never grow.

You'll never grow to new realms of understanding. If you just accept things, no, no, the scientific method is based on doubt. Ask questions. Be skeptical. Don't accept things.

And what he's saying is, if you start with certainties, you actually will find that you  actually don't learn as much, and if you start without, you learn more. So that's obviously even in any area of inquiry. But spiritually it is true, too. And the most famous place in the Bible that talks about doubt is doubting Thomas. Thomas was one of the twelve disciples, and after the death of Jesus Christ, he went  with there was a meeting of the disciples, and Jesus appears.

The resurrected Jesus appears and shows that he is alive. The problem is that Thomas missed the meeting. You know, remember some years ago I heard a preacher say, in Isaiah, chapter 6, Isaiah went  up to the temple, and he saw the Lord high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple,  and there was angels saying, holy, holy, holy, and Isaiah fell on the ground as dead. And I remember the preacher said, of course, he went to church, and the last person he expected  to actually see there was God. And in the same way, Thomas is a warning to you, never missed church.

You never know. Jesus might show up. Jesus might show up and you missed him. So I admit, it doesn't usually happen, but sometimes he does. Now, when Thomas hears that Jesus has been risen from the dead and all the disciples  that we saw him, Thomas says, I will not believe unless he appears to me.

And I not only see him, but I see the nail prints still in his hands and I can put my fingers  in the nail prints. And what does Jesus do? Jesus appears to Thomas. And remarkably, does not say, Thomas, why did you question me? You know, the first thing he says is, okay, you wanted to see my hands.

You wanted the nail prints. Here they are. Put your fingers in. And of course, Thomas responds with the great confession and affirmation, which in a way  is the climax of the book of John. He says, my Lord and my God, there is no place in the book of John where anybody looks right  at Jesus Christ and says, you're God.

In other words, this doubt, this expression of doubt brings Jesus into Thomas' life and  leads Thomas to a higher affirmation of faith than he would have had if he hadn't asked  for the doubt. And if he hadn't asked the question, if he hadn't doubted it. And yet, Jesus doesn't just simply see on the one hand, Jesus doesn't say, how dare you  question me. He gives Thomas what he asks for. On the other hand, he ends by saying, so Thomas, stop doubting and start believing.

And see, this is where Jesus shows us, the Bible shows us an attitude toward doubt  that neither religious people nor secular people have. It's not nearly as bad as religious people say it is and it's not nearly as good as secular  people say. He says, look, don't acquiesce in your doubt. Let the doubt drive you to something else, but at the same time, Jesus doesn't squalch  the doubts at all. So there's some important understanding about doubt and the vertigo and the disequilibrium  that it brings, but also the positive can be.

Secondly, what causes this man's doubt? Now there's two things he points out. First of all, he says, I saw something, secondly, he says, I experienced something. What did he see? Verse 1, 2 and 3 puts it in a nutshell.

God is good. God is good to those who are in pure and heart. Now that's the doctrine of God. That's a traditional biblical doctrine of God. God is a good God.

And he cares for the pure and heart. It doesn't mean sinless. It means people who are committed to God. So he starts off with good theology. God is a good God and he cares for the pure and heart.

But down in verse 3, it says, I saw the prosperity of the wicked. And then verses 4 to 11, which we didn't read for the sake of economy, says things like  this. He's looking at the wicked. What does he mean by that? They have no struggles.

Their bodies are healthy and strong. This is verses 4 to 11. They are free from common human burdens. They are not plagued by human ills. They close themselves with violence, with arrogance.

They threaten oppression. And they say, how can God know? Does the most high have knowledge? Now, what ASAP, the Psalmist is saying, is, under God in this universe, in this world,  supposedly, under a good God, people who promote themselves, people who manipulate  others, people who exploit others, are having a great life. And by the way, this is not just happened then.

The fact is this world is such that proud, self-promoting, ruthless, manipulative, egocentric,  exploitative behavior, can make you a lot of money, can make you pretty successful, can  help you up the power ladder. So what he's saying isn't anything that we haven't seen forever. And he's bothered by it. He says, why would a good God, a supposedly good God who's in charge of this world, allow  that kind of injustice, allow the powerful to oppress the poor and the marginalized? So that's the first thing.

But he's not just an intellectual problem. Because he also, it's not just he sees something, he experiences something. First hand, verse 13, 14, 16, he says, surely in vain, I have kept my heart pure, I have  washed my hands in innocence. All day long I've been afflicted and every morning brings new punishments. Now, tell me if this doesn't sound familiar.

Basically, he's saying, look, I tried to be pure. My understanding was that God cares for the pure and heart. So I've tried to keep my heart pure. I have washed my hands in innocence, but it seems to be in vain. Because all day long I'm afflicted and every morning brings new punishments.

We don't know what they were, but the point was his life was so filled with bad things  that almost every day he felt like woke up and learned something new is wrong. And finally, he says in verse 16, when I tried to understand all this, it troubled me deeply. In other words, he's not just having an intellectual problem, he's having a personal experience. And that personal experience means things that he believed with his mind are now not very  real to his heart, like the love and goodness of God. Now, here's what we learn.

Let's pull out of this because you might say, well, that's not my problems exactly. Okay, be careful. Don't get lost in the weeds here. We step outside of it a little bit and go a little bit higher up. And here's what we see, doubts come from a combination of reason and rationality and personal  experience.

Or let me put it like this, all faith, as well as all doubt, all our doubts, as well as  all our faith beliefs, always are the product, not just the thinking and of reasoning, but  a combination of thinking and reasoning and logic and intellectual thought, as well  as social and personal experience. How so? Well, let's talk about this. What do we mean by that? First of all, social and personal experience, social experience, there's a whole field  of sociology, you know, called the sociology of knowledge.

And the sociology of knowledge essentially says this, if we are to a great degree, we  think that we're arriving at our beliefs by thinking and working these things out, but  to a great degree, we find most plausible the beliefs of people who we want to like us. Can I say that again? I'm boiling down an entire course in sociology of knowledge, some of you which paid thousands  of dollars for, and if you had only been here first, you would have been able to save  that, and said, oh, I got that, okay, here it is. You tend to find most plausible the beliefs of people who you want to like you. We have certain circles that we want to be part of, we have certain social situations  that we want to be included in.

We've got people that we identify, these are our people, these are the people kind of people  I want to be identified with. And for some strange reason, those people's beliefs just seem more plausible to us than  other people's why, because we are not just brains in vats. We are social creatures, we're not just rational creatures. And therefore who we hang out with and what they say has an enormous impact on what seems  credible and plausible to us. And so your social experience has a lot to do with not only forming your beliefs, but also  forming your doubts, but there's also the personal experience, and see, our beliefs are  not simply a product of reasoning, they're also the product of personal experience.

You may read a book, and you may get a class in which people are saying, the founding  documents of the American Republic are absolutely right, all people are created equal. The races are created equal, individuals are created equal, everybody has equal dignity. But if you, what if you meet two or three members of a particular race or nationality, and  you've never met anybody else from that race or nationality, and those are nasty people  to you, they're nasty to you, they're cruel to you, they're cruel to you, the only three  people that you've ever met, I want you to know that no matter what the book says, you're  going to have a visceral negative personal feeling that there's something wrong with  those people. See in other words, your racial attitudes and your beliefs to a great degree are determined  by the personal experience, and look, that's unavoidable, because we aren't just rational  creatures, we're not just robots, we're not just computers, we're social beings, personal  beings as well as rational beings, and therefore your beliefs as well as your doubts come from  a combination of thinking and experiencing, which means that if you're in doubt, if you're  doubting things that you used to be certain of, it's because a combination of reason and  personal experiences have now made those beliefs unreal to your heart. Now what does that matter?

You say, well, here's what it matters, here's why it matters, I think a lot. On the one hand, I want you to avoid falling into one of two opposite mistakes. The one mistake is to think that if you have fallen into doubt about Christianity, it's  strictly an intellectual thing. Look, it's not very flattering, is it? To admit the degree to which we are socially shaped, the degree to which our experiences  shape us, let's just say you're raised in a church, raised in a Christian belief,  and then you go off to some really great elite academic institution, and everybody around  you, all your friends, all the people you want to be included with, all of your professors  are all laughing at traditional religious belief.

And then you pick up a book and you read Sigmund Freud, the future of allusion, and say,  oh, that convinced me that Christianity isn't true, are you? Come on, it's not just that, you know that, it doesn't work just that way, nobody works  that way. You were set up by your social environment to find what Sigmund Freud said to be pretty plausible. So I'm not saying he didn't have good arguments, I'm just trying to say, recognize the fact  that you are not simply, your doubts are not simply intellectual. They're also personal, okay?

But on the other hand, do not think that you can't reason and you can't think, don't  fall into the other extreme, which is to say, well, all our beliefs are just a product  of our culture. You know, you're from Madagascar, you're from Canada, you're from here, you're from there,  you're this race, of course you're going to believe that because you are all of our beliefs  are socially constructed, and therefore, you know, there's no, that's just the way it  is. Peter Berger, who was a pioneer in sociology of knowledge, wrote a little book some years  ago called A Rumor of Angels, and that book, he's got a great, great little chapter  called Relativizing the Relativizers. And in it he says this, he says, in my field, which has empirically proven that people  are very, very shaped in their beliefs by their culture and by their social location. He says, but in my field, it's sometimes common to have people say, all belief is socially  constructed, and therefore, you can't trust it.

And everybody's just the product of their culture, everybody's just the product of their  social setting, so you can't trust their beliefs, all beliefs are socially constructed. He says, the only problem with that statement is that statement is a belief. And if all beliefs are socially constructed and can't be trusted, then that belief is  the product of your social situation, and it can't be true. And if it can't be true, then all belief isn't socially constructed. Relativism always eats itself.

And so what do we left with? Oh, he says, we're fine. We're left with, we should have chastened, humbled views of ourselves. We should realize to a great degree we're not objective, to a great degree we don't like  to think outside the box of our social setting. And yet we have to, because Peter Burger says, in the end, you've got all these competing  truth claims, and we can't say we're just socially constructed, and therefore, there's  no way we can't wear a belief, because that belief would be socially constructed.

And therefore, in the end, we still have to say which of these beliefs is true. We still have to think. Don't just say, well, I'm just prejudiced. Why? Well, the three people I met from that race were all mean and cruel to me.

Well, think, do you think that maybe in your race there might be three cruel people? Don't you think it's possible that maybe that there's somebody could run into three  cruel people from your race and think all of you are that way? Think! So on the one hand, your doubts are not just from thinking, but on the other hand, you  still have to think. If you're going to process the doubts, all right, so how does he process the doubts?

How does the doubting become something he doesn't get stuck in, but that essentially he uses  to move himself up to a whole new level? What transforms out three things? This shouldn't completely surprise you since we just talked about it. Experience, thinking, and a enlarged view of God. Experience, thinking, and a enlarged view of God, okay, first of all, experience.

This is going to be kind of counterintuitive, but where does the turn happen? You know, verses 1 to 16, he's oppressed, I tried to understand all this, it troubled  me deeply, and then verse 17, until there's the turn. Things started to turn around right there, and what happens? That's the first thing that he does, until I entered the sanctuary of God. Then I understood their final destiny.

Now, don't make this mistake, don't think he was saying, well, he was walking along  the road, and he saw one of these big beautiful cathedrals which we have in New York, and  you notice the doors open, it looks beautiful in there, so you go on in, this is a beautiful  sanctuary, you sit down, and you just sort of think. That's not where he's talking about. You know why? Because the only sanctuary would have been the temple. And what happens in the temple is what?

Worship. He went to a worship service. He heard the word of God's song, he heard the word of God preached, he heard people singing,  he was surrounded by believers. You say, well, that's a strange thing to do, no, it's not a strange thing. Here's why.

It's fair, if you acknowledge, and I don't know how you fail to do this, if you acknowledge  that your doubts did not come strictly through thinking, well, then you're not going  to get through your doubts strictly through thinking. If your doubts, to some degree, came because you were in social and personal locations where  God seemed less real, then it's only fair to level the playing field and go to some place  where God seems more real. Go to a place where people believe in them, go to a place where people are talking about  them, go to a place where there's art, go to a place where there's teaching. In other words, at the very least, pray. You say, well, I don't understand that, I mean, if you have doubts about God, how can  you pray to Him?

I don't know, I have a lot of people who've had doubts about me and they came and talked  to me about it and it helped the relationship. You know, I'd rather you not sit around and think about, well, what do I think to Him is  like? I mean, I don't know, maybe He's like this, maybe He's like that, well, come ask me. You know, let's talk about this thing. And the same way, why, why if you got out of, why if you drifted away from belief through  not a combination of thinking and experience, you shouldn't come back to belief or through  belief, through a combination of not just thinking, but experience.

He didn't just go off and think, he went into the sanctuary, so that's the first thing. He was willing to put himself in an experiential location where God seemed real to Him so He  could clear it as mind, because He says, till I entered the sanctuary of God, then I understood  their destiny and that moves into the second thing. What is the second thing that He does is He does do some thinking and He does some profound  thinking here. And there's more in here than I can, you know, I've even thought about every, every time  I preach this, I keep thinking, maybe I'll go a little longer and give you a few more. No, I can't really, but I still want to show you two things He does.

Two profound ways He thinks through this. One is He is willing to admit His bad motives. Notice in the very beginning, He talks about how He sees all this injustice. You know, why are the powerful of pressing the marginalized? But notice what He says, even in the beginning, He's willing to be dishonest.

He says, as for me, my feet are most slipped, I nearly lost my foothold for I envy the arrogant. Isn't that interesting? He doesn't, what He's saying here, this is not just an intellectual problem. I was resentful because I feel, I'd like to have that kind of power. I'd like to have that kind of wealth.

He's very, very involved emotionally in this, that's why He says, wait a minute. I kept my heart pure, I've washed my hands in an instance, I deserve what they have. And what He's willing to admit here is, again, He's not just simply having an intellectual issue. It's not completely objective, but that His motives, His motives are involved, or put it like this. You will never admit,  no, until you admit that you find it hard to believe that X is true,  partly because you don't want X to be true.

See, until you admit that part of the reason you find it hard to believe X is true is  because you don't want it to be true, you're never really going to come to grips  with the pros and cons of the belief. You're never really going to be actually intellectually honest. Thomas Nagel, who's a professor of philosophy, very prominent philosopher at NYU,  I had the greatest respect for the man for a lot of reasons. But some years ago, he wrote in a book called The Last Word,  though he's an atheist, and he's a convinced atheist, and he argues very eloquently for it. Nevertheless, in this book, he writes this.

He says, I want to talk about the fear of religion. I speak from experience being strongly subject to this fear myself. I want atheism to be true. Oh, it isn't just that I don't believe in God, and naturally, I hope I'm right in my belief. It's that I hope there is no God.

I don't want there to be God. I don't want the universe to be like that, and then he adds in a little footnote. I am curious, however, whether there is anyone who is genuinely indifferent  as to whether there is a God. Now, what he means is, and this is what I mean by saying,  is such an intellectual honesty. He says, he talks to atheists who say, the only reason why I'm an atheist  is I looked at all the evidence very objectively,  and I decided the evidence was there was no God.

He says, listen, nobody's objective about this. Sure, you can say, well, Christians are people who want to believe in an afterlife. They want to believe they believe in God. They're going to live forever with their loved ones. But here he's saying, but atheists know that if there is a God,  they can't live the way they want to live.

He says, I don't want the universe to be like that. I don't want to have that limitation on my freedom. And therefore he says, there's nobody who's objective like nobody's objective. You've got a lot of reasons for not wanting God to exist. And you have some reasons for wanting Him to exist.

So admit it. See, that intellectual honesty is crucial. Admit your motives. Admit that you're not really that objective. Admit it.

Doesn't mean that you might not still come down where you were,  but you should recognize that. So first of all, he looks at his own motives,  but here's the second thing. He comes to recognize the deep faith that is hidden in all doubt. The deep faith that's embedded in hiding itself in all doubt. See, I think this is the most profound thing he sees.

And it's not that easy to see right off the bat until you put the stuff together. Notice how in the very beginning he says, in the very beginning of the turn,  not in the very beginning, but he says, till I enter the sanctuary of God,  then I understood their final destiny. And here's the money, quote, here's the main thing he saw. You place them on slippery ground. Now, remember the metaphor here?

This is a metaphor. You're foot sliding, you're foot slipping. He's already used it. What is it a metaphor for? Where your foot is is where you have your faith.

The thing you have your faith in. And therefore, when you're foot slips, it means you're having trouble keeping your faith. Now, he turns right, he says, no, wait a minute, wait a minute. Their foot is somewhere, too. They have faith in something.

And where their faith is is even more precarious than where my faith is. And what does that mean? OK, well, don't forget. Remember, I've already read this to you once it's verse 11. It wasn't read, it was not printed out.

But in verse 11, when describing these people, these oppressive people,  they say, how can God know? Does the most high have knowledge? See, these people who are living very selfishly, they're being cruel,  they're exploiting people, they are doing it on the basis of a view of God. They say, how can God know? Does the most high have knowledge?

And what that means is, they're assuming there either is no God,  or there's a God who isn't going to judge me. In other words, they're assuming that either God is not there  or that God does not care. Either there's no God or is some kind of pantheistic force field kind of God  that isn't going to judge me for how I live. They are living, then, on the basis of a view of God, which they can't prove. And if you are living your life, if you're assuming in the way in which you live,  a view of God that you can't prove, what is that?

That's faith. That is faith. See, you cannot prove God, maybe, but you can't prove there is no God. You can't prove that there isn't a God who's going to judge you. And therefore, when you live as if that God is not there, that is an act of faith.

You are betting your eternal destiny that there is either no God is not there  or is not a God that cares. Blaise Pascal, his famous Pascal's wager talks about that. If you've ever heard Pascal's wager, if you've heard about it or if you've heard it presented,  you probably have heard it presented in the worst possible light. It's always, I've never heard it presented in a way that's really as powerful as it really  is if you read it and think about it. Here's what Pascal is trying to say, sure, if you believe in God, it's a step of faith.

But if you don't believe in God, or if you live as if God's not there, that is also a  step of faith. That's a huge step of faith. It's your base in your life no matter how you live on a view of God that you can't prove  and therefore everybody's living by faith. Not only that, but why, at the end here, is he saying, who have I in heaven but you? And earth has nothing I desire beside you.

My flesh and my heart may fail but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever. Why is he saying that? What he's saying is a portion is your inheritance, a portion is the thing that you, what's your  wealth, it's your security. And for him to say, God is my portion, he's comparing his portion to theirs. See if God is your portion, if God is the thing that you're living for, if God in his  love is what you're living for, nobody can take that away from you.

But if wealth is what you're living for, if power is what you're living for, like these  people that he was envying so much, that can be taken away in a second. They're the ones who put their faith in power, in money, in accomplishment, in a claim,  whatever. They put their faith, they put their foot, they've rested their soul in something that can  be taken away from them forever, just like that quickly. And therefore he's saying, wait a minute, wait a minute. Here I'm getting filled with doubts, and yet I realize that the alternative, remember,  he envies them, which means he actually was thinking about what would be like to live  like them.

And he suddenly realizes, for me to live like them would mean that I would have to put  my faith in there not being a God which I can't prove. And I would have to rest my soul in these things which would be taken away forever, wait  a minute. And they're in a more slippery place than me. Their faith is less well grounded, and they are living by faith. And so he saw, in the heart of his doubt, in the heart of his doubt, was he was beginning  to say, maybe I'll live like these people instead of the way I've been living it, but that  would take faith.

It would take enormous amount of faith. And he says, no, no, no, no, the faith I've got is better. Do you see what he's doing? This is the reason why Sheldon Venokin in his book of severe mercy, when he's talking  about how he became a Christian. First of all, he talks about the fact that he realized to become a Christian, I had to  believe in Jesus Christ, and he didn't like that because he wanted to be certain, and  he wasn't getting, is what he says.

He says, I saw a gap between the possible and the proved. How was I to cross it? If I was to stake my whole life on the risen Christ, I wanted proof, I wanted certainty,  I wanted letters of fire across the sky. So, he was shrinking back, but then he said, here's what he said, but then I realized,  oh my God, there was a gap behind me, yes, I would have to leap, you know, there  would have to be a leap of faith to accepting Jesus Christ, because I couldn't prove that  Christ was God, but by God, I had no proof that he was not. This was not to be born.

I could not reject Jesus without great faith. And once I realized that, once I realized I would take faith for me to jump over the gap  behind me, I'd flung myself over the gap in front of me toward Jesus. Now, here's the last thing, and this is extremely interesting and important. The man expands his view, he doesn't just experience, he doesn't just think. He expands his view of God.

Thomas Kuhn wrote a book called The Structure Scientific Revolutions, very, very famous book,  and he was, what he tried to say was that all of us have paradigms, we have ways of thinking  about life, and we have doubts when the paradigm receives some data, it can't account for. And when it can't account for it, then there's a paradigm shift, which means you experienced  out, but then you expand the paradigm so it can explain the data that you couldn't understand. For example, I've ever seen this with little children, little teeny children, generally  as they grew up, they trust adults because the only adults in their lives are their parents  or there are some people, and maybe aunts and uncles and their babysitter and all that. And they expect all adults to be self-controlled and do this. At some point, the little child will see an adult doing something that she never thought  in a million years, adults would do.

And then mommy has to sit down and say, now honey, I have to understand something, your  theory of life, your paradigm of human nature is small, I mean, you're four. And you didn't think that adults could act like this, but honey, adults really can act  like this. So what's happening is she's going through a paradigm shift. Her theory of life was too small to handle the reality. And I want you to consider this, that when doubts come into your life, it's because your  understanding of God was too small to handle it.

And the way to get through it is not just simply to go back to the way which you believed  before, you have to have a broader view of God, a bigger view of God, and that's exactly  what he does here. And you know where the heart of it is? It's here in verse 21 and 22 and 23, excuse me. When my heart was grieved and my spirit embittered, I was senseless and ignorant, I was a brute  beast before you, yet I'm always with you. You hold me by my right hand.

Look here, he's changed as you have God. When he talks about himself as a beast, I was a brute beast. Let me give you two little stories. Elizabeth Elliott, missionary and writer, once told a story, a true story about how she  was visiting with some farmers, some sheep shepherds, basically sheep farmers in the highlands  of northern Wales. And she found out that once a year they have to take their sheep, and they have to dip  them in a vat of insecticide, otherwise the insects would literally eat the sheep.

But it's very hard on the sheep, because you have to grab the sheep by the four feet  up here and the hind legs, and dip them in like this, you know, just immerse them so  that they're submerged for something like 15 seconds or something like that. And I want you to know that even though it's exactly what the sheep need, none of them  like it. Just want you to know that. And as Elizabeth Elliott looked at that, and she was thinking about herself as a sheep  and the Lord is my shepherd, she says, you know what, God does that to us a lot. He gives us what we really need it even though we may not know it for 10 years, 20 years,  30 years, 40 years, or maybe not until after death.

And see, what this man is suddenly realizing is, wait a minute, if I really believe in  God, a God who created the world, of course he's going to be able to do what things happen  that I can't understand, how dare I think that somehow everything's got to happen just  the way I think. And then he realizes is I'm the sheep, I'm like the animal, and I'm not trusting my master. Another story is years ago, I was at a picnic, I remember this, and I was a little kitten  that had fallen into a stream, a very cold stream, and certainly would have drowned. And a boy went in and pulled the kitten out and rescued it. But as he was pulling the kitten out, the kitten of course was very scared and was just  biting and scratching his hand, the hand of his savior until it bled.

And what this man is saying is, my heart was grieved, my spirit embittered, I was senseless  and ignorant, I was like a brute beast before you. And yet I'm always with you, and you hold me by my right hand. He's getting a bigger view of God, he's letting God be big enough to do things that he  can't understand. He said, well, my goodness, why wouldn't I have a God that's bigger than I can, who can  do things that I can't understand? So his view of God is getting bigger and at the same time more tender, because he says,  you've never given up on me.

You're always with me, you're still holding me by my right hand. In spite of how stupid I've been, in spite of how I've bitten and scratched you, you  have continued to love me and be faithful to me. So as you've got, has gotten bigger and tenderer, and as a result, he can handle the life he  sees around him. Now, here's what I want to ask you though, how did that happen? How can he be sure that, in spite of the fact that he has been beastly to God, in spite  of the fact that he has been doing all this and he's been questioning him and he's been  treating God like this, how can he be sure that God is still with him?

How can he be sure that God has forgiven him? How can he be sure that God has never let him go? Now, I don't think he can be sure except that he's inspired by the Holy Spirit to write  a part of the Bible. It's divine revelation, he just knows it, but how can you and I know it? Why wouldn't God, when we act like this and we do act like this, why wouldn't God  just say, hey, natural consequences, just go your way?

How do we know that God has not let us go? He won't let us go. I'll tell you how. We don't have divine revelation, we've got, well, not direct, but we have the New Testament  and here's what we see. When Jesus Christ was on the cross, he cried out, my God, my God, why has thought forsaken  me?

Do you know what he was saying? My God, my God, why has thought forsaken me? When he was saying his father, I can't feel your hand. See all of Jesus' life, he was utterly different than the rest of us. He was never beastly toward his father.

He was always faithful to his father. He never questioned his father. He always loved his father. He was the one person who deserved to have God hold him by the hand, but at the end of  his life, God let him go. He says, oh, my God, my God, why has thought forsaken me?

Why? For us, Jesus Christ was getting what you and I deserve. He was losing the father's hand, so you and I can know that if we believe in Jesus  and we are accepted by God because of what Jesus has done, he will never let you go. He will never forsake you. In other words, we have a bigger view of God even than this man did.

He had no idea that God would be so great as to come to earth, as to come to earth and  become a human being. And go to the cross and do this for us. We have a bigger view of God and a more loving view of God than he ever had. And therefore, how much more should we be able to inhabit a large view of God that handles  life and how much more than he should we be able to say what he says at the end, whom  of I and heaven but you. And there is nothing I desire on earth more than you.

My flesh and my heart may fail but God is a strength of my heart and my portion forever. Let's pray. Our Father, we pray that you make us great through our doubts. We pray that you would move us to new levels through our doubts. But we pray that you would help us to know what to do with our doubts and we have gotten  some pretty good instruction from this passage, this scripture.

But most of all, O Lord, help us to see that in light of the cross, we can trust that  you do not give up on us, that you do not let go of us even when we're pretty bitter,  even when we're crying out, even when we're yelling, even when we're filled with doubts. We thank you that we're saved by grace, not through our good works, not through the level  of our certainty. We thank you that we're saved by grace through Jesus and we pray that you would help us  to grow in grace because of what he did. Make all this true and realize in our lives, we pray this in Jesus' name, amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

Welcome to Gospel and Life! How comfortable are you when it comes to being open about your faith? This month on the podcast, Tim Keller looks at what the Bible says about having a public  faith. He shows us what it looks like to be open about our faith in a pluralistic society, in a way  that creates civility and peace and meaningful dialogue with our neighbors. The Scripture reading is from Psalm chapter 73 verses 1 through 3 and 12 through 26.

Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart, but as for me, my feet  had almost slipped, I had nearly lost my foothold. For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. This is what the wicked are like, always free of care, they go on a massing wealth. Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure and have washed my hands and innocence. All day long I have been afflicted and every morning brings new punishments.

If I had spoken out like that, I would have betrayed your children. When I tried to understand all this, it troubled me deeply till I entered the sanctuary  of God, then I understood their final destiny. Surely you placed them on slippery ground, you cast them down to ruin. How suddenly are they destroyed, completely swept away by terrors. They are like a dream when one wakes, when you arise Lord, you will despise them as fantasies.

When my heart was greed and my spirit imbitered, I was senseless and ignorant, I was a brute  beast before you, yet I am always with you. You hold me by my right hand, you guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will take  me into glory. Whom have I in heaven but you, and earth has nothing I desire besides you. My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever. This is God's word.

So, we are in a series called public faith, sharing the hope that is within. We live in a society, Western society, that does not encourage people to be public about  their faith, their religious beliefs. We are told that it is a private thing we should not be talking about, but it is ironic  because our culture actually encourages us to be absolutely open and public about everything  else, everything else, including sexuality, because it is who we are. But there is nothing more fundamental to who you are than your religious beliefs than  your deepest faith beliefs, and therefore the challenge before us as a society is how can  we be honest about who we are, which means how can we be public about our faith beliefs,  and yet do so in such a way that is respectful and supports the peace. So we all have to learn that, and one of the things we are doing in this series is talking  about that.

Now, if we are going to become a mature society in which we are able to talk about faith,  we also have to be able to know how to talk about doubt. We don't get much help here from either religious people or secular people. Religious people tend to see doubt as a very bad thing, a terrible thing, and around many  religious people, it doesn't feel safe to express doubts. But on the other hand, many secular people, certainly in a place like New York City, many  people believe that perennial doubt, constant doubt, deep skepticism is the only sophisticated  and intellectually mature position. The Bible, however, doesn't look at doubt anywhere nearly as positive or as negative as  that.

The Bible doesn't say it is as positive as secular people do, or as negative as religious  people do. Because actually doubt is not so simplistic, it's not at all good, it's not all bad, and  only when you begin to see it in a nuanced way can doubt actually be something through  which we make progress. Now, in order to understand what the Bible says about that, we are going to look at this  very famous psalm, this very famous passage. We've read the beginning and the end of it, we left just for economy's sake, we left  out a certain part of the middle which I'll refer to. It's very, very rich, and it's the case study of one man's, his name was ASAF, the psalmist,  one man's experience of doubt, how he moved through that doubt to actually a higher level  of faith, and even though it may not exactly be the same, his circumstances may not exactly  be the same as yours.

Nevertheless, the basic principles of what the Bible says about doubt, and I actually  think what the Bible says about that is almost unique. I don't know if anywhere else to look, in which doubt is not so good and not so bad, but  this nuanced, multidimensional thing, there's no better place to find that biblical view  than here. So let's look in this passage at doubt under three headings. What is it? What causes it?

What transforms it? What is it? What causes it? What transforms it? So what is it?

The metaphor for doubt that's used is in verse two. Verse for me, my feet had almost slipped, I nearly lost my foothold. Now that's a great image. When you're losing your foothold, for a moment you've lost your balance, and when you've  lost your balance, you're experiencing a certain kind of a vertigo, a kind of disorientation,  you know, a certain dizziness. There's one of the Greek words in the New Testament for doubt, die-psychos, which means  dipsychos, which means two psyches, which basically means spiritual double vision.

If you have double vision, it means your eye is not giving your brain sufficient information  to know where to put your foot. And when you're not quite sure where to put the foot, there's an uncertainty, and that's  what doubt is. Spiritually, it's this uncertainty. You lose the certainty you might have had before, and that's doubt. Now, what do we learn right off the bat about doubt from the very introduction here in  the beginning?

The answer, first of all, we learn that anybody can have doubts. Because even though we don't know much about ASAP, we don't know who this, much about who  this guy is, the author of the Psalm, still he was an author of the scripture. That's a rather high level of spiritual attainment, don't you think? Here's somebody who wrote scripture, divinely inspired. And yet, here's a man who, in spite of his level of spiritual attainment, was filled with  doubts.

He said, I almost lost my foothold, which means I almost lost my faith hold. So anybody can have doubts. But the other thing we learn, almost immediately, just by the quick read through, is that doubt  can be a positive thing. Here you have doubts that are, that will, by the end of the book, and excuse me, by the  end of the Psalm, will have led to a higher level of faith, and some of the most famous  affirmations, my flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and  my portion forever. In other words, there's been progress here.

Now the idea of faith leading, pardon me, of doubt and questioning leading to progress  shouldn't be all that strange. Francis Bacon, who was one of the first modern scientists, a couple hundred years ago,  he was one of the early modern scientists, has a place where he says, and he's kind of  overstating it a bit, but he's right. If you begin with certainties, you will end in doubts. If you begin with doubts, you end in certainty. And what he's really saying is, as a scientist, he says, if you look at what right now is  accepted by people, if you don't question that, if you just accept everything that is  told you, you'll never grow.

You'll never grow to new realms of understanding. If you just accept things, no, no, the scientific method is based on doubt. Ask questions. Be skeptical. Don't accept things.

And what he's saying is, if you start with certainties, you actually will find that you  actually don't learn as much, and if you start without, you learn more. So that's obviously even in any area of inquiry. But spiritually it is true, too. And the most famous place in the Bible that talks about doubt is doubting Thomas. Thomas was one of the twelve disciples, and after the death of Jesus Christ, he went  with there was a meeting of the disciples, and Jesus appears.

The resurrected Jesus appears and shows that he is alive. The problem is that Thomas missed the meeting. You know, remember some years ago I heard a preacher say, in Isaiah, chapter 6, Isaiah went  up to the temple, and he saw the Lord high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple,  and there was angels saying, holy, holy, holy, and Isaiah fell on the ground as dead. And I remember the preacher said, of course, he went to church, and the last person he expected  to actually see there was God. And in the same way, Thomas is a warning to you, never missed church.

You never know. Jesus might show up. Jesus might show up and you missed him. So I admit, it doesn't usually happen, but sometimes he does. Now, when Thomas hears that Jesus has been risen from the dead and all the disciples  that we saw him, Thomas says, I will not believe unless he appears to me.

And I not only see him, but I see the nail prints still in his hands and I can put my fingers  in the nail prints. And what does Jesus do? Jesus appears to Thomas. And remarkably, does not say, Thomas, why did you question me? You know, the first thing he says is, okay, you wanted to see my hands.

You wanted the nail prints. Here they are. Put your fingers in. And of course, Thomas responds with the great confession and affirmation, which in a way  is the climax of the book of John. He says, my Lord and my God, there is no place in the book of John where anybody looks right  at Jesus Christ and says, you're God.

In other words, this doubt, this expression of doubt brings Jesus into Thomas' life and  leads Thomas to a higher affirmation of faith than he would have had if he hadn't asked  for the doubt. And if he hadn't asked the question, if he hadn't doubted it. And yet, Jesus doesn't just simply see on the one hand, Jesus doesn't say, how dare you  question me. He gives Thomas what he asks for. On the other hand, he ends by saying, so Thomas, stop doubting and start believing.

And see, this is where Jesus shows us, the Bible shows us an attitude toward doubt  that neither religious people nor secular people have. It's not nearly as bad as religious people say it is and it's not nearly as good as secular  people say. He says, look, don't acquiesce in your doubt. Let the doubt drive you to something else, but at the same time, Jesus doesn't squalch  the doubts at all. So there's some important understanding about doubt and the vertigo and the disequilibrium  that it brings, but also the positive can be.

Secondly, what causes this man's doubt? Now there's two things he points out. First of all, he says, I saw something, secondly, he says, I experienced something. What did he see? Verse 1, 2 and 3 puts it in a nutshell.

God is good. God is good to those who are in pure and heart. Now that's the doctrine of God. That's a traditional biblical doctrine of God. God is a good God.

And he cares for the pure and heart. It doesn't mean sinless. It means people who are committed to God. So he starts off with good theology. God is a good God and he cares for the pure and heart.

But down in verse 3, it says, I saw the prosperity of the wicked. And then verses 4 to 11, which we didn't read for the sake of economy, says things like  this. He's looking at the wicked. What does he mean by that? They have no struggles.

Their bodies are healthy and strong. This is verses 4 to 11. They are free from common human burdens. They are not plagued by human ills. They close themselves with violence, with arrogance.

They threaten oppression. And they say, how can God know? Does the most high have knowledge? Now, what ASAP, the Psalmist is saying, is, under God in this universe, in this world,  supposedly, under a good God, people who promote themselves, people who manipulate  others, people who exploit others, are having a great life. And by the way, this is not just happened then.

The fact is this world is such that proud, self-promoting, ruthless, manipulative, egocentric,  exploitative behavior, can make you a lot of money, can make you pretty successful, can  help you up the power ladder. So what he's saying isn't anything that we haven't seen forever. And he's bothered by it. He says, why would a good God, a supposedly good God who's in charge of this world, allow  that kind of injustice, allow the powerful to oppress the poor and the marginalized? So that's the first thing.

But he's not just an intellectual problem. Because he also, it's not just he sees something, he experiences something. First hand, verse 13, 14, 16, he says, surely in vain, I have kept my heart pure, I have  washed my hands in innocence. All day long I've been afflicted and every morning brings new punishments. Now, tell me if this doesn't sound familiar.

Basically, he's saying, look, I tried to be pure. My understanding was that God cares for the pure and heart. So I've tried to keep my heart pure. I have washed my hands in innocence, but it seems to be in vain. Because all day long I'm afflicted and every morning brings new punishments.

We don't know what they were, but the point was his life was so filled with bad things  that almost every day he felt like woke up and learned something new is wrong. And finally, he says in verse 16, when I tried to understand all this, it troubled me deeply. In other words, he's not just having an intellectual problem, he's having a personal experience. And that personal experience means things that he believed with his mind are now not very  real to his heart, like the love and goodness of God. Now, here's what we learn.

Let's pull out of this because you might say, well, that's not my problems exactly. Okay, be careful. Don't get lost in the weeds here. We step outside of it a little bit and go a little bit higher up. And here's what we see, doubts come from a combination of reason and rationality and personal  experience.

Or let me put it like this, all faith, as well as all doubt, all our doubts, as well as  all our faith beliefs, always are the product, not just the thinking and of reasoning, but  a combination of thinking and reasoning and logic and intellectual thought, as well  as social and personal experience. How so? Well, let's talk about this. What do we mean by that? First of all, social and personal experience, social experience, there's a whole field  of sociology, you know, called the sociology of knowledge.

And the sociology of knowledge essentially says this, if we are to a great degree, we  think that we're arriving at our beliefs by thinking and working these things out, but  to a great degree, we find most plausible the beliefs of people who we want to like us. Can I say that again? I'm boiling down an entire course in sociology of knowledge, some of you which paid thousands  of dollars for, and if you had only been here first, you would have been able to save  that, and said, oh, I got that, okay, here it is. You tend to find most plausible the beliefs of people who you want to like you. We have certain circles that we want to be part of, we have certain social situations  that we want to be included in.

We've got people that we identify, these are our people, these are the people kind of people  I want to be identified with. And for some strange reason, those people's beliefs just seem more plausible to us than  other people's why, because we are not just brains in vats. We are social creatures, we're not just rational creatures. And therefore who we hang out with and what they say has an enormous impact on what seems  credible and plausible to us. And so your social experience has a lot to do with not only forming your beliefs, but also  forming your doubts, but there's also the personal experience, and see, our beliefs are  not simply a product of reasoning, they're also the product of personal experience.

You may read a book, and you may get a class in which people are saying, the founding  documents of the American Republic are absolutely right, all people are created equal. The races are created equal, individuals are created equal, everybody has equal dignity. But if you, what if you meet two or three members of a particular race or nationality, and  you've never met anybody else from that race or nationality, and those are nasty people  to you, they're nasty to you, they're cruel to you, they're cruel to you, the only three  people that you've ever met, I want you to know that no matter what the book says, you're  going to have a visceral negative personal feeling that there's something wrong with  those people. See in other words, your racial attitudes and your beliefs to a great degree are determined  by the personal experience, and look, that's unavoidable, because we aren't just rational  creatures, we're not just robots, we're not just computers, we're social beings, personal  beings as well as rational beings, and therefore your beliefs as well as your doubts come from  a combination of thinking and experiencing, which means that if you're in doubt, if you're  doubting things that you used to be certain of, it's because a combination of reason and  personal experiences have now made those beliefs unreal to your heart. Now what does that matter?

You say, well, here's what it matters, here's why it matters, I think a lot. On the one hand, I want you to avoid falling into one of two opposite mistakes. The one mistake is to think that if you have fallen into doubt about Christianity, it's  strictly an intellectual thing. Look, it's not very flattering, is it? To admit the degree to which we are socially shaped, the degree to which our experiences  shape us, let's just say you're raised in a church, raised in a Christian belief,  and then you go off to some really great elite academic institution, and everybody around  you, all your friends, all the people you want to be included with, all of your professors  are all laughing at traditional religious belief.

And then you pick up a book and you read Sigmund Freud, the future of allusion, and say,  oh, that convinced me that Christianity isn't true, are you? Come on, it's not just that, you know that, it doesn't work just that way, nobody works  that way. You were set up by your social environment to find what Sigmund Freud said to be pretty plausible. So I'm not saying he didn't have good arguments, I'm just trying to say, recognize the fact  that you are not simply, your doubts are not simply intellectual. They're also personal, okay?

But on the other hand, do not think that you can't reason and you can't think, don't  fall into the other extreme, which is to say, well, all our beliefs are just a product  of our culture. You know, you're from Madagascar, you're from Canada, you're from here, you're from there,  you're this race, of course you're going to believe that because you are all of our beliefs  are socially constructed, and therefore, you know, there's no, that's just the way it  is. Peter Berger, who was a pioneer in sociology of knowledge, wrote a little book some years  ago called A Rumor of Angels, and that book, he's got a great, great little chapter  called Relativizing the Relativizers. And in it he says this, he says, in my field, which has empirically proven that people  are very, very shaped in their beliefs by their culture and by their social location. He says, but in my field, it's sometimes common to have people say, all belief is socially  constructed, and therefore, you can't trust it.

And everybody's just the product of their culture, everybody's just the product of their  social setting, so you can't trust their beliefs, all beliefs are socially constructed. He says, the only problem with that statement is that statement is a belief. And if all beliefs are socially constructed and can't be trusted, then that belief is  the product of your social situation, and it can't be true. And if it can't be true, then all belief isn't socially constructed. Relativism always eats itself.

And so what do we left with? Oh, he says, we're fine. We're left with, we should have chastened, humbled views of ourselves. We should realize to a great degree we're not objective, to a great degree we don't like  to think outside the box of our social setting. And yet we have to, because Peter Burger says, in the end, you've got all these competing  truth claims, and we can't say we're just socially constructed, and therefore, there's  no way we can't wear a belief, because that belief would be socially constructed.

And therefore, in the end, we still have to say which of these beliefs is true. We still have to think. Don't just say, well, I'm just prejudiced. Why? Well, the three people I met from that race were all mean and cruel to me.

Well, think, do you think that maybe in your race there might be three cruel people? Don't you think it's possible that maybe that there's somebody could run into three  cruel people from your race and think all of you are that way? Think! So on the one hand, your doubts are not just from thinking, but on the other hand, you  still have to think. If you're going to process the doubts, all right, so how does he process the doubts?

How does the doubting become something he doesn't get stuck in, but that essentially he uses  to move himself up to a whole new level? What transforms out three things? This shouldn't completely surprise you since we just talked about it. Experience, thinking, and a enlarged view of God. Experience, thinking, and a enlarged view of God, okay, first of all, experience.

This is going to be kind of counterintuitive, but where does the turn happen? You know, verses 1 to 16, he's oppressed, I tried to understand all this, it troubled  me deeply, and then verse 17, until there's the turn. Things started to turn around right there, and what happens? That's the first thing that he does, until I entered the sanctuary of God. Then I understood their final destiny.

Now, don't make this mistake, don't think he was saying, well, he was walking along  the road, and he saw one of these big beautiful cathedrals which we have in New York, and  you notice the doors open, it looks beautiful in there, so you go on in, this is a beautiful  sanctuary, you sit down, and you just sort of think. That's not where he's talking about. You know why? Because the only sanctuary would have been the temple. And what happens in the temple is what?

Worship. He went to a worship service. He heard the word of God's song, he heard the word of God preached, he heard people singing,  he was surrounded by believers. You say, well, that's a strange thing to do, no, it's not a strange thing. Here's why.

It's fair, if you acknowledge, and I don't know how you fail to do this, if you acknowledge  that your doubts did not come strictly through thinking, well, then you're not going  to get through your doubts strictly through thinking. If your doubts, to some degree, came because you were in social and personal locations where  God seemed less real, then it's only fair to level the playing field and go to some place  where God seems more real. Go to a place where people believe in them, go to a place where people are talking about  them, go to a place where there's art, go to a place where there's teaching. In other words, at the very least, pray. You say, well, I don't understand that, I mean, if you have doubts about God, how can  you pray to Him?

I don't know, I have a lot of people who've had doubts about me and they came and talked  to me about it and it helped the relationship. You know, I'd rather you not sit around and think about, well, what do I think to Him is  like? I mean, I don't know, maybe He's like this, maybe He's like that, well, come ask me. You know, let's talk about this thing. And the same way, why, why if you got out of, why if you drifted away from belief through  not a combination of thinking and experience, you shouldn't come back to belief or through  belief, through a combination of not just thinking, but experience.

He didn't just go off and think, he went into the sanctuary, so that's the first thing. He was willing to put himself in an experiential location where God seemed real to Him so He  could clear it as mind, because He says, till I entered the sanctuary of God, then I understood  their destiny and that moves into the second thing. What is the second thing that He does is He does do some thinking and He does some profound  thinking here. And there's more in here than I can, you know, I've even thought about every, every time  I preach this, I keep thinking, maybe I'll go a little longer and give you a few more. No, I can't really, but I still want to show you two things He does.

Two profound ways He thinks through this. One is He is willing to admit His bad motives. Notice in the very beginning, He talks about how He sees all this injustice. You know, why are the powerful of pressing the marginalized? But notice what He says, even in the beginning, He's willing to be dishonest.

He says, as for me, my feet are most slipped, I nearly lost my foothold for I envy the arrogant. Isn't that interesting? He doesn't, what He's saying here, this is not just an intellectual problem. I was resentful because I feel, I'd like to have that kind of power. I'd like to have that kind of wealth.

He's very, very involved emotionally in this, that's why He says, wait a minute. I kept my heart pure, I've washed my hands in an instance, I deserve what they have. And what He's willing to admit here is, again, He's not just simply having an intellectual issue. It's not completely objective, but that His motives, His motives are involved, or put it like this. You will never admit,  no, until you admit that you find it hard to believe that X is true,  partly because you don't want X to be true.

See, until you admit that part of the reason you find it hard to believe X is true is  because you don't want it to be true, you're never really going to come to grips  with the pros and cons of the belief. You're never really going to be actually intellectually honest. Thomas Nagel, who's a professor of philosophy, very prominent philosopher at NYU,  I had the greatest respect for the man for a lot of reasons. But some years ago, he wrote in a book called The Last Word,  though he's an atheist, and he's a convinced atheist, and he argues very eloquently for it. Nevertheless, in this book, he writes this.

He says, I want to talk about the fear of religion. I speak from experience being strongly subject to this fear myself. I want atheism to be true. Oh, it isn't just that I don't believe in God, and naturally, I hope I'm right in my belief. It's that I hope there is no God.

I don't want there to be God. I don't want the universe to be like that, and then he adds in a little footnote. I am curious, however, whether there is anyone who is genuinely indifferent  as to whether there is a God. Now, what he means is, and this is what I mean by saying,  is such an intellectual honesty. He says, he talks to atheists who say, the only reason why I'm an atheist  is I looked at all the evidence very objectively,  and I decided the evidence was there was no God.

He says, listen, nobody's objective about this. Sure, you can say, well, Christians are people who want to believe in an afterlife. They want to believe they believe in God. They're going to live forever with their loved ones. But here he's saying, but atheists know that if there is a God,  they can't live the way they want to live.

He says, I don't want the universe to be like that. I don't want to have that limitation on my freedom. And therefore he says, there's nobody who's objective like nobody's objective. You've got a lot of reasons for not wanting God to exist. And you have some reasons for wanting Him to exist.

So admit it. See, that intellectual honesty is crucial. Admit your motives. Admit that you're not really that objective. Admit it.

Doesn't mean that you might not still come down where you were,  but you should recognize that. So first of all, he looks at his own motives,  but here's the second thing. He comes to recognize the deep faith that is hidden in all doubt. The deep faith that's embedded in hiding itself in all doubt. See, I think this is the most profound thing he sees.

And it's not that easy to see right off the bat until you put the stuff together. Notice how in the very beginning he says, in the very beginning of the turn,  not in the very beginning, but he says, till I enter the sanctuary of God,  then I understood their final destiny. And here's the money, quote, here's the main thing he saw. You place them on slippery ground. Now, remember the metaphor here?

This is a metaphor. You're foot sliding, you're foot slipping. He's already used it. What is it a metaphor for? Where your foot is is where you have your faith.

The thing you have your faith in. And therefore, when you're foot slips, it means you're having trouble keeping your faith. Now, he turns right, he says, no, wait a minute, wait a minute. Their foot is somewhere, too. They have faith in something.

And where their faith is is even more precarious than where my faith is. And what does that mean? OK, well, don't forget. Remember, I've already read this to you once it's verse 11. It wasn't read, it was not printed out.

But in verse 11, when describing these people, these oppressive people,  they say, how can God know? Does the most high have knowledge? See, these people who are living very selfishly, they're being cruel,  they're exploiting people, they are doing it on the basis of a view of God. They say, how can God know? Does the most high have knowledge?

And what that means is, they're assuming there either is no God,  or there's a God who isn't going to judge me. In other words, they're assuming that either God is not there  or that God does not care. Either there's no God or is some kind of pantheistic force field kind of God  that isn't going to judge me for how I live. They are living, then, on the basis of a view of God, which they can't prove. And if you are living your life, if you're assuming in the way in which you live,  a view of God that you can't prove, what is that?

That's faith. That is faith. See, you cannot prove God, maybe, but you can't prove there is no God. You can't prove that there isn't a God who's going to judge you. And therefore, when you live as if that God is not there, that is an act of faith.

You are betting your eternal destiny that there is either no God is not there  or is not a God that cares. Blaise Pascal, his famous Pascal's wager talks about that. If you've ever heard Pascal's wager, if you've heard about it or if you've heard it presented,  you probably have heard it presented in the worst possible light. It's always, I've never heard it presented in a way that's really as powerful as it really  is if you read it and think about it. Here's what Pascal is trying to say, sure, if you believe in God, it's a step of faith.

But if you don't believe in God, or if you live as if God's not there, that is also a  step of faith. That's a huge step of faith. It's your base in your life no matter how you live on a view of God that you can't prove  and therefore everybody's living by faith. Not only that, but why, at the end here, is he saying, who have I in heaven but you? And earth has nothing I desire beside you.

My flesh and my heart may fail but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever. Why is he saying that? What he's saying is a portion is your inheritance, a portion is the thing that you, what's your  wealth, it's your security. And for him to say, God is my portion, he's comparing his portion to theirs. See if God is your portion, if God is the thing that you're living for, if God in his  love is what you're living for, nobody can take that away from you.

But if wealth is what you're living for, if power is what you're living for, like these  people that he was envying so much, that can be taken away in a second. They're the ones who put their faith in power, in money, in accomplishment, in a claim,  whatever. They put their faith, they put their foot, they've rested their soul in something that can  be taken away from them forever, just like that quickly. And therefore he's saying, wait a minute, wait a minute. Here I'm getting filled with doubts, and yet I realize that the alternative, remember,  he envies them, which means he actually was thinking about what would be like to live  like them.

And he suddenly realizes, for me to live like them would mean that I would have to put  my faith in there not being a God which I can't prove. And I would have to rest my soul in these things which would be taken away forever, wait  a minute. And they're in a more slippery place than me. Their faith is less well grounded, and they are living by faith. And so he saw, in the heart of his doubt, in the heart of his doubt, was he was beginning  to say, maybe I'll live like these people instead of the way I've been living it, but that  would take faith.

It would take enormous amount of faith. And he says, no, no, no, no, the faith I've got is better. Do you see what he's doing? This is the reason why Sheldon Venokin in his book of severe mercy, when he's talking  about how he became a Christian. First of all, he talks about the fact that he realized to become a Christian, I had to  believe in Jesus Christ, and he didn't like that because he wanted to be certain, and  he wasn't getting, is what he says.

He says, I saw a gap between the possible and the proved. How was I to cross it? If I was to stake my whole life on the risen Christ, I wanted proof, I wanted certainty,  I wanted letters of fire across the sky. So, he was shrinking back, but then he said, here's what he said, but then I realized,  oh my God, there was a gap behind me, yes, I would have to leap, you know, there  would have to be a leap of faith to accepting Jesus Christ, because I couldn't prove that  Christ was God, but by God, I had no proof that he was not. This was not to be born.

I could not reject Jesus without great faith. And once I realized that, once I realized I would take faith for me to jump over the gap  behind me, I'd flung myself over the gap in front of me toward Jesus. Now, here's the last thing, and this is extremely interesting and important. The man expands his view, he doesn't just experience, he doesn't just think. He expands his view of God.

Thomas Kuhn wrote a book called The Structure Scientific Revolutions, very, very famous book,  and he was, what he tried to say was that all of us have paradigms, we have ways of thinking  about life, and we have doubts when the paradigm receives some data, it can't account for. And when it can't account for it, then there's a paradigm shift, which means you experienced  out, but then you expand the paradigm so it can explain the data that you couldn't understand. For example, I've ever seen this with little children, little teeny children, generally  as they grew up, they trust adults because the only adults in their lives are their parents  or there are some people, and maybe aunts and uncles and their babysitter and all that. And they expect all adults to be self-controlled and do this. At some point, the little child will see an adult doing something that she never thought  in a million years, adults would do.

And then mommy has to sit down and say, now honey, I have to understand something, your  theory of life, your paradigm of human nature is small, I mean, you're four. And you didn't think that adults could act like this, but honey, adults really can act  like this. So what's happening is she's going through a paradigm shift. Her theory of life was too small to handle the reality. And I want you to consider this, that when doubts come into your life, it's because your  understanding of God was too small to handle it.

And the way to get through it is not just simply to go back to the way which you believed  before, you have to have a broader view of God, a bigger view of God, and that's exactly  what he does here. And you know where the heart of it is? It's here in verse 21 and 22 and 23, excuse me. When my heart was grieved and my spirit embittered, I was senseless and ignorant, I was a brute  beast before you, yet I'm always with you. You hold me by my right hand.

Look here, he's changed as you have God. When he talks about himself as a beast, I was a brute beast. Let me give you two little stories. Elizabeth Elliott, missionary and writer, once told a story, a true story about how she  was visiting with some farmers, some sheep shepherds, basically sheep farmers in the highlands  of northern Wales. And she found out that once a year they have to take their sheep, and they have to dip  them in a vat of insecticide, otherwise the insects would literally eat the sheep.

But it's very hard on the sheep, because you have to grab the sheep by the four feet  up here and the hind legs, and dip them in like this, you know, just immerse them so  that they're submerged for something like 15 seconds or something like that. And I want you to know that even though it's exactly what the sheep need, none of them  like it. Just want you to know that. And as Elizabeth Elliott looked at that, and she was thinking about herself as a sheep  and the Lord is my shepherd, she says, you know what, God does that to us a lot. He gives us what we really need it even though we may not know it for 10 years, 20 years,  30 years, 40 years, or maybe not until after death.

And see, what this man is suddenly realizing is, wait a minute, if I really believe in  God, a God who created the world, of course he's going to be able to do what things happen  that I can't understand, how dare I think that somehow everything's got to happen just  the way I think. And then he realizes is I'm the sheep, I'm like the animal, and I'm not trusting my master. Another story is years ago, I was at a picnic, I remember this, and I was a little kitten  that had fallen into a stream, a very cold stream, and certainly would have drowned. And a boy went in and pulled the kitten out and rescued it. But as he was pulling the kitten out, the kitten of course was very scared and was just  biting and scratching his hand, the hand of his savior until it bled.

And what this man is saying is, my heart was grieved, my spirit embittered, I was senseless  and ignorant, I was like a brute beast before you. And yet I'm always with you, and you hold me by my right hand. He's getting a bigger view of God, he's letting God be big enough to do things that he  can't understand. He said, well, my goodness, why wouldn't I have a God that's bigger than I can, who can  do things that I can't understand? So his view of God is getting bigger and at the same time more tender, because he says,  you've never given up on me.

You're always with me, you're still holding me by my right hand. In spite of how stupid I've been, in spite of how I've bitten and scratched you, you  have continued to love me and be faithful to me. So as you've got, has gotten bigger and tenderer, and as a result, he can handle the life he  sees around him. Now, here's what I want to ask you though, how did that happen? How can he be sure that, in spite of the fact that he has been beastly to God, in spite  of the fact that he has been doing all this and he's been questioning him and he's been  treating God like this, how can he be sure that God is still with him?

How can he be sure that God has forgiven him? How can he be sure that God has never let him go? Now, I don't think he can be sure except that he's inspired by the Holy Spirit to write  a part of the Bible. It's divine revelation, he just knows it, but how can you and I know it? Why wouldn't God, when we act like this and we do act like this, why wouldn't God  just say, hey, natural consequences, just go your way?

How do we know that God has not let us go? He won't let us go. I'll tell you how. We don't have divine revelation, we've got, well, not direct, but we have the New Testament  and here's what we see. When Jesus Christ was on the cross, he cried out, my God, my God, why has thought forsaken  me?

Do you know what he was saying? My God, my God, why has thought forsaken me? When he was saying his father, I can't feel your hand. See all of Jesus' life, he was utterly different than the rest of us. He was never beastly toward his father.

He was always faithful to his father. He never questioned his father. He always loved his father. He was the one person who deserved to have God hold him by the hand, but at the end of  his life, God let him go. He says, oh, my God, my God, why has thought forsaken me?

Why? For us, Jesus Christ was getting what you and I deserve. He was losing the father's hand, so you and I can know that if we believe in Jesus  and we are accepted by God because of what Jesus has done, he will never let you go. He will never forsake you. In other words, we have a bigger view of God even than this man did.

He had no idea that God would be so great as to come to earth, as to come to earth and  become a human being. And go to the cross and do this for us. We have a bigger view of God and a more loving view of God than he ever had. And therefore, how much more should we be able to inhabit a large view of God that handles  life and how much more than he should we be able to say what he says at the end, whom  of I and heaven but you. And there is nothing I desire on earth more than you.

My flesh and my heart may fail but God is a strength of my heart and my portion forever. Let's pray. Our Father, we pray that you make us great through our doubts. We pray that you would move us to new levels through our doubts. But we pray that you would help us to know what to do with our doubts and we have gotten  some pretty good instruction from this passage, this scripture.

But most of all, O Lord, help us to see that in light of the cross, we can trust that  you do not give up on us, that you do not let go of us even when we're pretty bitter,  even when we're crying out, even when we're yelling, even when we're filled with doubts. We thank you that we're saved by grace, not through our good works, not through the level  of our certainty. We thank you that we're saved by grace through Jesus and we pray that you would help us  to grow in grace because of what he did. Make all this true and realize in our lives, we pray this in Jesus' name, amen.

欢迎来到福音与生活！当谈到公开你的信仰时，你感觉有多自在？本月在播客中,蒂姆·凯勒探讨圣经关于公开信仰的教导。他向我们展示在多元化社会中公开我们的信仰是什么样子，以一种能与我们的邻居创造文明、和平和有意义对话的方式。经文是诗篇第73章第1至3节和第12至26节。

神实在恩待以色列那些清心的人。至于我，我的脚几乎失闪，我的脚险些滑跌。我见恶人和狂傲人享平安，就心怀不平。恶人是这样的，他们常享安逸，财宝便加增。我实在徒然洁净了我的心，徒然洗手表明无辜。因为我终日遭灾难，每早晨受惩治。

我若说我要这样讲，这就是以奸诈待你的众子。我思索怎能明白这事，眼看实系为难，等我进了神的圣所，思想他们的结局。你实在把他们安在滑地，使他们掉在沉沦之中。他们转眼之间成了何等的荒凉！他们被惊恐灭尽了。人睡醒了，怎样看梦，主啊，你醒了，也必照样轻看他们的影像。

因而我心里发酸，肺腑被刺。我这样愚昧无知，在你面前如畜类一般。然而我常与你同在，你搀着我的右手。你要以你的训言引导我，以后必接我到荣耀里。除你以外，在天上我有谁呢？除你以外，在地上我也没有所爱慕的。我的肉体和我的心肠衰残，但神是我心里的力量，又是我的福分，直到永远。这是神的话语。

所以，我们正在进行一个名为"公开信仰，分享内心盼望"的系列。我们生活在西方社会，这个社会不鼓励人们公开他们的信仰、他们的宗教信念。我们被告知这是私人的事情，不应该谈论，但讽刺的是，我们的文化实际上鼓励我们对其他所有事情都绝对开放和公开，包括性，因为那是我们的身份。但没有什么比你的宗教信念、你最深层的信仰更能定义你是谁了，因此，作为一个社会，我们面临的挑战是如何诚实地表达我们是谁，这意味着我们如何公开我们的信仰，同时以一种尊重和支持和平的方式去做。所以我们都必须学习这一点，我们在这个系列中做的事情之一就是谈论这个。

现在，如果我们要成为一个成熟的社会，能够谈论信仰，我们也必须知道如何谈论怀疑。宗教人士或世俗人士都没有在这方面给予我们太多帮助。宗教人士倾向于把怀疑看作是一件非常糟糕的事情，一件可怕的事情，在许多宗教人士周围，表达怀疑感觉不安全。但另一方面，许多世俗人士，特别是在像纽约这样的地方，许多人相信长期的怀疑、持续的怀疑、深度的怀疑主义是唯一成熟和理智成熟的立场。然而，圣经对怀疑的看法既不像世俗人士说的那么积极，也不像宗教人士说的那么消极。

圣经并不像世俗人士那样说它是积极的，也不像宗教人士那样说它是消极的。因为实际上怀疑并不是那么简单化的，它不全是好的，也不全是坏的，只有当你开始以一种细致入微的方式看待它时，怀疑实际上才能成为我们取得进步的东西。现在，为了理解圣经对此的说法，我们将看这首非常著名的诗篇，这段非常著名的经文。我们读了它的开头和结尾，为了节约起见，我们省略了中间的某些部分，我会提到的。它非常丰富，这是一个人的案例研究，他的名字叫亚萨，这位诗篇作者，一个人的怀疑经历，他如何度过那个怀疑，实际上达到了更高层次的信仰，即使它可能不完全相同，他的情况可能不完全与你的相同。

尽管如此，圣经关于怀疑的基本原则，我实际上认为圣经对此的说法几乎是独特的。我不知道还有哪里可以看到，怀疑既不那么好也不那么坏，而是这种微妙的、多维度的东西，没有比这里更好的地方来找到圣经的观点了。所以让我们在这段经文中从三个方面来看怀疑。它是什么？什么导致了它？

什么改变了它？它是什么？什么导致了它？什么改变了它？那么它是什么呢？

用来描述怀疑的比喻在第二节。至于我，我的脚几乎失闪，我的脚险些滑跌。现在这是一个很好的形象。当你失去立足点时，有那么一刻你失去了平衡，当你失去平衡时，你会经历某种眩晕，一种迷失方向，你知道，某种头晕。新约中有一个希腊词用来表示怀疑，"双魂"，意思是两个灵魂，基本上意味着属灵的双重视觉。

如果你有双重视觉，这意味着你的眼睛没有给你的大脑足够的信息来知道把你的脚放在哪里。当你不太确定把脚放在哪里时，就有一种不确定性，这就是怀疑。从灵性上讲，这就是这种不确定性。你失去了你以前可能拥有的确定性，这就是怀疑。现在，从这里的开头我们立刻对怀疑了解到什么呢？

答案是，首先，我们了解到任何人都可能有怀疑。因为即使我们对亚萨了解不多，我们不太了解这个家伙是谁，诗篇的作者，但他仍然是圣经的作者。这是相当高水平的灵性成就，你不觉得吗？这是一个写圣经的人，受神启示的。然而，这是一个人，尽管他的灵性成就水平很高，却充满了怀疑。

他说，我几乎失去了我的立足点，这意味着我几乎失去了我的信仰立足点。所以任何人都可能有怀疑。但我们几乎立即学到的另一件事，只需快速通读，就是怀疑可以是一件积极的事情。你有这样的怀疑，到诗篇结束时，抱歉，到诗篇结束时，将导致更高层次的信仰，以及一些最著名的肯定，"我的肉体和我的心肠衰残，但神是我心里的力量，又是我的福分，直到永远。"换句话说，这里已经有了进步。

现在，信仰导致，对不起，怀疑和质疑导致进步的想法不应该那么陌生。弗朗西斯·培根，几百年前最早的现代科学家之一，他是早期现代科学家之一，有一个地方他说，他有点夸大其词，但他是对的。如果你从确定性开始，你将以怀疑结束。如果你从怀疑开始，你会以确定性结束。他真正说的是，作为一名科学家，他说，如果你看看现在人们接受的东西，如果你不质疑它，如果你只是接受别人告诉你的一切，你永远不会成长。

你永远不会成长到新的理解领域。如果你只是接受事物，不，不，科学方法是建立在怀疑的基础上的。提问。要有怀疑精神。不要接受事物。

他说的是，如果你从确定性开始，你实际上会发现你实际上学不到那么多，如果你不从确定性开始，你会学到更多。所以这显然在任何探究领域都是如此。但在灵性上也是如此。圣经中谈论怀疑最著名的地方是怀疑的多马。多马是十二门徒之一，在耶稣基督死后，他去参加了一次门徒聚会，耶稣出现了。

复活的耶稣出现并表明他还活着。问题是多马错过了那次聚会。你知道，记得几年前我听到一位传道人说，在以赛亚书第六章，以赛亚上到圣殿，他看见主高高在上，他的衣裳垂下遮满圣殿，有天使说，圣哉，圣哉，圣哉，以赛亚倒在地上如同死了。我记得那位传道人说，当然，他去了教堂，他最不期望在那里见到的人就是神。同样，多马是对你的警告，永远不要错过教堂。

你永远不知道。耶稣可能会出现。耶稣可能会出现，而你错过了他。所以我承认，这通常不会发生，但有时会发生。现在，当多马听说耶稣已经从死里复活，所有门徒都说我们看见了他，多马说，我不会相信，除非他向我显现。

我不仅要看见他，而且要看到他手上的钉痕，我可以把我的手指放在钉痕里。耶稣做了什么？耶稣向多马显现。值得注意的是，他没有说，多马，你为什么质疑我？你知道，他说的第一件事是，好吧，你想看我的手。

你想要钉痕。在这里。把你的手指放进去。当然，多马以伟大的认信和肯定回应，在某种程度上，这是约翰福音的高潮。他说，我的主，我的神，在约翰福音中没有任何地方有人直接看着耶稣基督说，你是神。

换句话说，这个怀疑，这种怀疑的表达将耶稣带入多马的生命，并导致多马对信仰的更高肯定，比如果他没有提出怀疑会有的要高。如果他没有提出问题，如果他没有怀疑。然而，一方面，耶稣并不只是说，你怎么敢质疑我。他给了多马他所要求的。另一方面，他最后说，所以多马，不要再怀疑了，开始相信吧。

看，这就是耶稣向我们展示的，圣经向我们展示的对怀疑的态度，既不是宗教人士也不是世俗人士所持有的。它不像宗教人士说的那么糟糕，也不像世俗人士说的那么好。他说，看，不要默许你的怀疑。让怀疑驱使你去别的东西，但同时，耶稣根本不压制怀疑。所以对于怀疑以及它带来的眩晕和失衡有一些重要的理解，但也有积极的一面。

其次，是什么导致了这个人的怀疑？现在有两件事他指出。首先，他说，我看到了一些东西，其次，他说，我经历了一些东西。他看到了什么？第1、2和3节简要概括了。

神是良善的。神对清心的人是良善的。现在这是关于神的教义。这是圣经中关于神的传统教义。神是良善的神。

他关心清心的人。这并不意味着无罪。它意味着委身于神的人。所以他从良好的神学开始。神是良善的神，他关心清心的人。

但在第3节中，它说，我看到恶人享平安。然后第4到11节，为了节约起见我们没有读，说了这样的话。他在看着恶人。他是什么意思？他们没有挣扎。

他们的身体健康强壮。这是第4到11节。他们没有常人的重担。他们不受常人的疾病困扰。他们用暴力、傲慢包裹自己。

他们威胁压迫。他们说，神怎能知道？至高者岂有知识呢？现在，亚萨，这位诗篇作者说的是，在神之下，在这个宇宙中，在这个世界上，据说在一位良善的神之下，那些抬举自己、操纵他人、剥削他人的人，过着很好的生活。顺便说一句，这不仅仅是当时发生的事。

事实是，这个世界是这样的，骄傲的、自我抬举的、无情的、操纵的、自我中心的、剥削的行为，可以让你赚很多钱，可以让你相当成功，可以帮助你登上权力阶梯。所以他说的不是我们永远没见过的东西。他为此感到困扰。他说，为什么一位良善的神，一位据说良善的掌管这个世界的神，会允许那种不公正，允许强大的人压迫贫穷和边缘化的人？这是第一件事。

但这不仅仅是一个智力问题。因为他也，不仅仅是他看到了什么，他还经历了什么。亲身经历，第13、14、16节，他说，我实在徒然洁净了我的心，徒然洗手表明无辜。我终日遭灾难，每早晨受惩治。现在，告诉我这听起来是否熟悉。

基本上，他说，看，我努力保持纯洁。我的理解是神关心清心的人。所以我努力保持我的心纯洁。我洗手表明无辜，但这似乎是徒然的。因为我终日遭灾难，每早晨受惩治。

我们不知道它们是什么，但重点是他的生活充满了糟糕的事情，几乎每天他都觉得醒来就得知又有什么新的错误。最后，他在第16节说，我思索怎能明白这事，眼看实系为难。换句话说，他不仅仅有一个智力问题，他还有一个个人经历。那个个人经历意味着他在头脑中相信的事情现在对他的心来说不是很真实，比如神的爱和良善。现在，这是我们学到的。

让我们从中提取出来，因为你可能会说，嗯，那不完全是我的问题。好吧，小心。不要在细节中迷失。我们稍微跳出来，稍微提高一点。这是我们看到的，怀疑来自理性和理性思考与个人经历的结合。

或者让我这样说，所有的信仰，以及所有的怀疑，我们所有的怀疑，以及我们所有的信仰，总是产生于不仅仅是思考和推理，而是思考、推理、逻辑和智力思想的结合，以及社会和个人经历。怎么说呢？嗯，让我们谈谈这个。我们的意思是什么？首先，社会和个人经历，社会经历，有整个社会学领域，你知道，叫做知识社会学。

知识社会学基本上是这样说的，如果我们在很大程度上，我们认为我们通过思考和解决这些问题来得出我们的信念，但在很大程度上，我们发现那些我们希望喜欢我们的人的信念最合理。我能再说一次吗？我正在将整个知识社会学课程浓缩，你们中的一些人为此支付了数千美元，如果你先来这里，你本可以节省那笔钱，然后说，哦，我明白了，好的，就是这样。你倾向于发现那些你希望喜欢你的人的信念最合理。我们有某些我们想成为其中一部分的圈子，我们有某些我们想被包括在内的社会环境。

我们有一些人，我们认同，这些是我们的人，这些是我想被认同的那种人。出于某种奇怪的原因，这些人的信念对我们来说似乎比其他人的更合理，为什么，因为我们不仅仅是罐子里的大脑。我们是社会生物，我们不仅仅是理性生物。因此，我们与谁交往以及他们说什么对我们认为什么是可信和合理的有巨大影响。所以你的社会经历与形成你的信念有很大关系，也与形成你的怀疑有很大关系，但还有个人经历，看，我们的信念不仅仅是推理的产物，它们也是个人经历的产物。

你可能读一本书，你可能上一堂课，人们说，美国共和国的建国文件是绝对正确的，所有人都是平等创造的。种族是平等创造的，个人是平等创造的，每个人都有平等的尊严。但如果你，如果你遇到某个特定种族或国籍的两三个成员，而你从未见过那个种族或国籍的其他任何人，那些人对你很讨厌，他们对你很讨厌，他们对你很残忍，他们对你很残忍，你见过的唯一三个人，我想让你知道，无论书上怎么说，你都会有一种发自内心的负面个人感觉，认为那些人有问题。看，换句话说，你的种族态度和信念在很大程度上是由个人经历决定的，看，这是不可避免的，因为我们不仅仅是理性生物，我们不仅仅是机器人，我们不仅仅是计算机，我们是社会存在，个人存在以及理性存在，因此你的信念以及你的怀疑来自思考和经历的结合，这意味着如果你在怀疑，如果你怀疑你曾经确信的事情，那是因为理性和个人经历的结合现在使那些信念对你的心来说不真实了。现在那有什么关系呢？

你说，嗯，这是它的关系，这就是为什么它很重要，我认为非常重要。一方面，我希望你避免陷入两个相反的错误之一。一个错误是认为如果你对基督教产生了怀疑，这纯粹是一个智力问题。看，承认我们在多大程度上受到社会塑造，我们的经历在多大程度上塑造我们，这不是很令人愉快，是吗？让我们假设你在教堂长大，在基督教信仰中长大，然后你去了某个非常棒的精英学术机构，你周围的每个人，你所有的朋友，所有你想被包括在内的人，你所有的教授都在嘲笑传统的宗教信仰。

然后你拿起一本书，读西格蒙德·弗洛伊德的《幻觉的未来》，说，哦，那说服了我基督教不是真的，是吗？拜托，不仅仅是那个，你知道的，它不是那样运作的，没有人那样运作。你的社会环境为你准备好了，让你发现西格蒙德·弗洛伊德所说的相当合理。所以我不是说他没有好的论点，我只是想说，认识到你不仅仅是，你的怀疑不仅仅是智力上的。它们也是个人的，好吗？

但另一方面，不要认为你不能推理，你不能思考，不要陷入另一个极端，也就是说，嗯，我们所有的信念都只是我们文化的产物。你知道，你来自马达加斯加，你来自加拿大，你来自这里，你来自那里，你是这个种族，当然你会相信那个，因为你所有的信念都是社会建构的，因此，你知道，没有，就是这样。彼得·伯格，他是知识社会学的先驱，几年前写了一本小书叫《天使的谣言》，在那本书中，他有一个很棒的小章节叫《相对化相对主义者》。在其中他说，在我的领域，经验证明人们的信念在很大程度上受到他们的文化和社会位置的影响。他说，但在我的领域，有时人们会说，所有信念都是社会建构的，因此，你不能相信它。

每个人都只是他们文化的产物，每个人都只是他们社会环境的产物，所以你不能相信他们的信念，所有信念都是社会建构的。他说，这个陈述的唯一问题是这个陈述是一个信念。如果所有信念都是社会建构的，不能被信任，那么这个信念是你社会环境的产物，它不能是真的。如果它不能是真的，那么所有信念并不都是社会建构的。相对主义总是吃掉自己。

那么我们剩下什么？哦，他说，我们很好。我们剩下的是，我们应该对自己有谦卑、谦逊的看法。我们应该意识到在很大程度上我们不客观，在很大程度上我们不喜欢在我们社会环境的框框之外思考。然而我们必须这样做，因为彼得·伯格说，最终，你有所有这些竞争的真理声明，我们不能说我们只是社会建构的，因此，我们没有办法不能穿上一个信念，因为那个信念会是社会建构的。

因此，最终，我们仍然必须说这些信念中哪一个是真的。我们仍然必须思考。不要只是说，嗯，我只是有偏见的。为什么？嗯，我遇到的那个种族的三个人都对我刻薄和残忍。

嗯，想想，你认为也许在你的种族中可能有三个残忍的人吗？你不觉得有可能有人可能遇到你种族中的三个残忍的人，并认为你们所有人都是那样的吗？思考！所以一方面，你的怀疑不仅仅来自思考，但另一方面，你仍然必须思考。如果你要处理怀疑，好吧，那么他如何处理怀疑？

怀疑如何成为他不会陷入其中的东西，而是他基本上用来将自己提升到一个全新水平的东西？是什么改变了三件事？这不应该完全让你惊讶，因为我们刚刚谈到了它。经历、思考和对神的扩大视野。经历、思考和对神的扩大视野，好吧，首先，经历。

这会有点违反直觉，但转折发生在哪里？你知道，第1到16节，他很压抑，我思索怎能明白这事，眼看实系为难，然后第17节，直到有转折。事情在那里开始转变，发生了什么？这是他做的第一件事，直到我进了神的圣所。然后我明白了他们的结局。

现在，不要犯这个错误，不要认为他说的是，嗯，他在路上走，他看到我们在纽约有的这些大而美丽的大教堂之一，你注意到门开着，里面看起来很漂亮，所以你走进去，这是一个美丽的圣所，你坐下来，你只是思考。他说的不是那个。你知道为什么吗？因为唯一的圣所应该是圣殿。圣殿里发生什么？

敬拜。他去参加了一次敬拜聚会。他听到神的话语被歌唱，他听到神的话语被传讲，他听到人们唱歌，他被信徒包围。你说，嗯，那是一件奇怪的事情，不，这不是一件奇怪的事情。原因如下。

这是公平的，如果你承认，我不知道你怎么不这样做，如果你承认你的怀疑不是严格通过思考而来的，那么，你不会仅仅通过思考来克服你的怀疑。如果你的怀疑，在某种程度上，是因为你在社会和个人位置上，神看起来不那么真实，那么公平地说，应该平衡竞争环境，去一些神看起来更真实的地方。去一个人们相信他的地方，去一个人们谈论他的地方，去一个有艺术的地方，去一个有教导的地方。换句话说，至少，祷告。你说，嗯，我不明白，我的意思是，如果你对神有怀疑，你怎么能向他祷告？

我不知道，有很多人对我有怀疑，他们来和我谈论这件事，这帮助了关系。你知道，我宁愿你不要坐在那里想，嗯，我认为他是什么样的？我的意思是，我不知道，也许他是这样的，也许他是那样的，好吧，来问我。你知道，让我们谈谈这件事。同样，为什么，为什么如果你通过不是思考和经历的结合而远离信仰，你不应该通过不仅仅是思考，而是经历的结合回到信仰或通过信仰。

他不只是去思考，他进入了圣所，所以这是第一件事。他愿意把自己放在一个神对他来说似乎真实的经验位置，这样他就可以清理他的头脑，因为他说，直到我进了神的圣所，然后我明白了他们的命运，这进入了第二件事。第二件事是他确实做了一些思考，他在这里做了一些深刻的思考。这里面的内容比我能，你知道，我每次传讲这个，我一直在想，也许我会讲得更长一点，给你更多。不，我真的不能，但我仍然想向你展示他做的两件事。

他思考这个问题的两种深刻方式。一种是他愿意承认他的坏动机。注意在一开始，他谈论他看到的所有不公正。你知道，为什么强大的人在压迫边缘化的人？但注意他说什么，即使在一开始，他也愿意不诚实。

他说，至于我，我的脚几乎失闪，我的脚险些滑跌，因为我嫉妒狂傲人。这不是很有趣吗？他不，他在这里说的是，这不仅仅是一个智力问题。我很愤恨，因为我觉得，我想拥有那种权力。我想拥有那种财富。

他在这件事上非常情绪化，这就是为什么他说，等一下。我保持我的心纯洁，我洗手表明无辜，我应得他们拥有的。他在这里愿意承认的是，再次，他不仅仅有一个智力问题。这不是完全客观的，而是他的动机，他的动机参与其中，或者这样说。你永远不会承认，不，直到你承认你发现很难相信X是真的，部分原因是你不想X是真的。

看，直到你承认你发现很难相信X是真的的部分原因是因为你不想它是真的，你永远不会真正面对信念的利弊。你永远不会真正诚实地对待智力。托马斯·内格尔，他是纽约大学非常杰出的哲学教授，出于很多原因，我对这个人有极大的尊重。但几年前，他在一本名为《最后的话》的书中写道，尽管他是无神论者，他是一个确信的无神论者，他非常雄辩地为此辩护。然而，在这本书中，他写道。

他说，我想谈谈对宗教的恐惧。我从经验中说话，我自己也强烈地受到这种恐惧的影响。我希望无神论是真的。哦，不仅仅是我不相信神，自然地，我希望我的信念是对的。而是我希望没有神。

我不想有神。我不想宇宙是那样的，然后他在一个小脚注中补充说。然而，我很好奇，是否有人真正对是否有神漠不关心。现在，他的意思是，这就是我所说的，是这样的智力诚实。他说，他和无神论者交谈，他们说，我是无神论者的唯一原因是我非常客观地看了所有证据，我决定证据表明没有神。

他说，听着，没有人对此客观。当然，你可以说，嗯，基督徒是那些想相信来世的人。他们想相信他们相信神。他们将永远与他们所爱的人在一起。但他在这里说，但无神论者知道如果有神，他们就不能按照他们想要的方式生活。

他说，我不想宇宙是那样的。我不想对我的自由有那种限制。因此他说，没有人像没有人客观一样客观。你有很多理由不想神存在。你有一些理由想要他存在。

所以承认它。看，那种智力诚实是至关重要的。承认你的动机。承认你并不真的那么客观。承认它。

这并不意味着你可能不会仍然得出你原来的结论，但你应该认识到这一点。所以首先，他审视自己的动机，但这是第二件事。他开始认识到隐藏在所有怀疑中的深层信仰。隐藏在所有怀疑中自我隐藏的深层信仰。看，我认为这是他看到的最深刻的事情。

一开始不那么容易看到，直到你把这些东西放在一起。注意他在转折的一开始是如何说的，不是在一开始，但他说，直到我进了神的圣所，然后我明白了他们的结局。这是关键引用，这是他看到的主要内容。你把他们安在滑地。现在，记住这里的比喻吗？

这是一个比喻。你的脚在滑，你的脚在滑。他已经用过了。它是什么的比喻？你的脚在哪里就是你信仰的地方。

你信仰的东西。因此，当你的脚滑时，这意味着你在保持信仰方面遇到了麻烦。现在，他转身说，不，等一下，等一下。他们的脚也在某个地方。他们相信某些东西。

他们的信仰所在的地方比我信仰所在的地方更不稳固。这是什么意思？好吧，不要忘记。记住，我已经给你读过一次了，是第11节。没有读出来，没有打印出来。

但在第11节，在描述这些人，这些压迫性的人时，他们说，神怎能知道？至高者岂有知识呢？看，这些过着非常自私生活的人，他们很残忍，他们在剥削人，他们这样做是基于对神的一种看法。他们说，神怎能知道？至高者岂有知识呢？

这意味着，他们假设要么没有神，要么有一位不会审判我的神。换句话说，他们假设要么神不存在，要么神不关心。要么没有神，要么是某种泛神论的力场式的神，不会因为我的生活方式而审判我。那么，他们是基于对神的一种他们无法证明的看法而生活。如果你在生活，如果你在假设你的生活方式中，对神的一种你无法证明的看法，那是什么？

那就是信仰。那就是信仰。看，你也许无法证明神，但你无法证明没有神。你无法证明没有一位会审判你的神。因此，当你生活得好像那位神不存在时，那是一种信仰行为。

你在赌你的永恒命运，要么没有神，要么不是一位关心的神。布莱兹·帕斯卡，他著名的帕斯卡赌注谈到了这一点。如果你听说过帕斯卡赌注，如果你听说过它或听到它的陈述，你可能听到的是以可能最糟糕的方式陈述的。这总是，我从未听过它以一种真正强有力的方式陈述，如果你阅读它并思考它，它真的很强大。帕斯卡试图说的是，当然，如果你相信神，这是一个信仰的步骤。

但如果你不相信神，或者如果你生活得好像神不存在，那也是一个信仰的步骤。那是一个巨大的信仰步骤。无论你如何生活，你都在基于对神的一种你无法证明的看法来建立你的生活，因此每个人都在凭信仰生活。不仅如此，但为什么，在这里的结尾，他说，除你以外，在天上我有谁呢？除你以外，在地上我也没有所爱慕的。

我的肉体和我的心肠衰残，但神是我心里的力量，又是我的福分，直到永远。他为什么这样说？他说的是一个福分是你的继承，一个福分是你的东西，什么是你的财富，是你的安全。对他来说，说神是我的福分，他在比较他的福分和他们的福分。看，如果神是你的福分，如果神是你为之而活的东西，如果神在他的爱中是你为之而活的，没有人能夺走它。

但如果财富是你为之而活的，如果权力是你为之而活的，就像他如此嫉妒的这些人一样，那可以在一瞬间被夺走。他们是那些把信仰放在权力、金钱、成就、声誉上的人，无论什么。他们把信仰，他们把脚，他们把灵魂安放在可以永远被夺走的东西上，就像那样快速。因此他说，等一下，等一下。我在这里充满怀疑，然而我意识到另一种选择，记住，他嫉妒他们，这意味着他实际上在想像他们一样生活会是什么样子。

他突然意识到，我要像他们一样生活意味着我必须相信没有神，而我无法证明这一点。我必须把我的灵魂安放在这些可以永远被夺走的东西上，等一下。他们在一个比我更滑的地方。他们的信仰根基更不牢固，他们在凭信仰生活。所以他看到，在他怀疑的核心，在他怀疑的核心，他开始说，也许我会像这些人一样生活，而不是我一直生活的方式，但那需要信仰。

那需要巨大的信仰。他说，不，不，不，不，我拥有的信仰更好。你明白他在做什么吗？这就是为什么谢尔登·瓦努肯在他的书《严厉的怜悯》中，当他谈论他如何成为基督徒时。首先，他谈到他意识到要成为基督徒，我必须相信耶稣基督，他不喜欢那样，因为他想要确定，而他没有得到，这是他说的。他说，我看到可能和已证明之间的差距。我如何跨越它？如果我要把我的整个生命押在复活的基督上，我想要证据，我想要确定性，我想要天空中的火字。

所以，他在退缩，但后来他说，他说的是，但后来我意识到，哦，我的天，我身后也有一个差距，是的，我必须跳跃，你知道，接受耶稣基督需要信仰的跳跃，因为我无法证明基督是神，但天哪，我也没有证据证明他不是。这是无法忍受的。

我不能在没有巨大信仰的情况下拒绝耶稣。一旦我意识到这一点，一旦我意识到我要跨越身后的差距需要信仰，我就把自己抛过了前面朝向耶稣的差距。现在，这是最后一件事，这是极其有趣和重要的。这个人扩大了他的视野，他不只是经历，他不只是思考。他扩大了对神的视野。

托马斯·库恩写了一本名为《科学革命的结构》的书，非常非常著名的书，他试图说的是，我们所有人都有范式，我们有关于生活的思考方式，当范式接收到一些它无法解释的数据时，我们就会产生怀疑。当它无法解释时，就会发生范式转变，这意味着你经历了怀疑，但然后你扩展范式，使它能够解释你无法理解的数据。例如，我见过小孩子这样，很小的孩子，通常在他们长大的过程中，他们信任成年人，因为他们生活中唯一的成年人是他们的父母，或者有一些人，也许是叔叔阿姨和他们的保姆之类的。他们期望所有成年人都自我控制，做这些事。在某个时候，小孩子会看到一个成年人做一些她百万年都没想过成年人会做的事情。

然后妈妈必须坐下来说，现在宝贝，我必须明白一件事，你的生活理论，你的人性范式太小了，我的意思是，你四岁。你不认为成年人会这样行事，但宝贝，成年人真的可以这样行事。所以发生的事情是她正在经历一个范式转变。她的生活理论太小了，无法处理现实。我想让你考虑这一点，当怀疑进入你的生活时，那是因为你对神的理解太小了，无法处理它。

克服它的方法不只是简单地回到你以前相信的方式，你必须对神有一个更广阔的视野，对神有一个更大的视野，这正是他在这里所做的。你知道它的核心在哪里吗？它在这里第21和22以及23节，对不起。当我心里发酸，肺腑被刺时，我这样愚昧无知，在你面前如畜类一般，然而我常与你同在。你搀着我的右手。

看这里，他改变了你对神的看法。当他谈论自己如同野兽时，我是一只野兽。让我给你讲两个小故事。伊丽莎白·艾略特，传教士和作家，曾经讲过一个故事，一个真实的故事，关于她如何拜访一些农民，一些牧羊人，基本上是威尔士北部高地的养羊农民。她发现每年一次他们必须抓住他们的羊，他们必须把它们浸在一桶杀虫剂里，否则昆虫会真的吃掉羊。

但这对羊来说很艰难，因为你必须抓住羊的四只脚，前腿和后腿，然后像这样浸它们，你知道，只是把它们浸没，让它们被淹没大约15秒钟之类的。我想让你知道，即使这正是羊需要的，没有一只喜欢它。只想让你知道这一点。当伊丽莎白·艾略特看着这个时，她在想自己是一只羊，主是我的牧者，她说，你知道吗，神经常对我们这样做。他给我们真正需要的东西，即使我们可能10年、20年、30年、40年都不知道，或者也许直到死后才知道。

看，这个人突然意识到的是，等一下，如果我真的相信神，一位创造世界的神，当然他能够做一些我无法理解的事情，我怎么敢认为所有事情都必须按照我认为的方式发生。然后他意识到我是羊，我就像动物，我不信任我的主人。另一个故事是几年前，我记得这个，我在一次野餐，我记得这个，一只小猫掉进了一条小溪，一条非常冷的小溪，肯定会淹死。一个男孩走进去把小猫拉了出来，救了它。但当他把小猫拉出来时，小猫当然很害怕，只是咬和抓他的手，它的救主的手，直到流血。

这个人说的是，我的心发酸，我的灵被刺，我愚昧无知，在你面前如畜类一般。然而我常与你同在，你搀着我的右手。他对神有了更大的视野，他让神大到足以做一些他无法理解的事情。他说，嗯，我的天，为什么我不能有一位大到我无法理解的神，他能做一些我无法理解的事情？所以他对神的视野变得更大，同时也更温柔，因为他说，你从未放弃过我。

你一直与我同在，你仍然搀着我的右手。尽管我有多愚蠢，尽管我咬你抓你，你继续爱我，对我忠诚。所以他对神的认识变得更大更温柔，结果，他可以处理他周围看到的生活。现在，这是我想问你的，这是如何发生的？他怎么能确定，尽管他对神如此野蛮，尽管他做了所有这些，他一直在质疑他，他一直这样对待神，他怎么能确定神仍然与他同在？

他怎么能确定神已经原谅了他？他怎么能确定神从未让他离开？现在，我不认为他能确定，除非他受圣灵启示写圣经的一部分。这是神的启示，他就是知道，但你和我怎么能知道呢？为什么神不会，当我们这样行事，我们确实这样行事时，为什么神不会只是说，嘿，自然后果，你走你的路？

我们怎么知道神没有让我们离开？他不会让我们离开。我告诉你怎么知道。我们没有神的启示，我们有，嗯，不是直接的，但我们有新约，这是我们看到的。当耶稣基督在十字架上时，他喊道，我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？

你知道他在说什么吗？我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？当他说他的父亲，我感觉不到你的手。看耶稣的一生，他与我们其他人完全不同。他从未对他的父亲野蛮。

他一直对他的父亲忠诚。他从未质疑他的父亲。他一直爱他的父亲。他是唯一应该让神搀着他的手的人，但在他生命的尽头，神让他离开了。他说，哦，我的神，我的神,为什么离弃我？

为什么？为了我们，耶稣基督得到了你我应得的。他失去了父亲的手，所以你和我可以知道，如果我们相信耶稣，我们因耶稣所做的而被神接纳，他永远不会让你离开。他永远不会离弃你。换句话说，我们对神的视野比这个人更大。

他不知道神会如此伟大，以至于来到地上，来到地上成为人。并上十字架为我们做这件事。我们对神有一个比他更大的视野和对神更有爱的视野。因此，我们应该更能够拥有一个处理生活的对神的广阔视野，我们应该比他更能够说他最后说的话，除你以外，在天上我有谁呢。除你以外，在地上我也没有所爱慕的。

我的肉体和我的心肠衰残，但神是我心里的力量，又是我的福分，直到永远。让我们祷告。我们的父，我们祈求你通过我们的怀疑使我们伟大。我们祈求你通过我们的怀疑把我们提升到新的层次。但我们祈求你帮助我们知道如何处理我们的怀疑，我们从这段经文，这段圣经中得到了一些相当好的指导。

但最重要的是，主啊，帮助我们看到，鉴于十字架，我们可以相信你不会放弃我们，你不会让我们离开，即使我们相当痛苦，即使我们在喊叫，即使我们在叫喊，即使我们充满怀疑。我们感谢你我们是因恩典得救的，不是通过我们的好行为，不是通过我们确定性的水平。我们感谢你我们是因恩典通过耶稣得救的，我们祈求你帮助我们因他所做的在恩典中成长。让这一切在我们的生命中成真和实现，我们奉耶稣的名祷告，阿门。

欢迎来到福音与生命！当谈到公开自己的信仰时，你感到多自在呢？本月在播客中，提姆·凯勒探讨圣经对于拥有公开信仰的教导。他向我们展示了在多元化社会中公开我们的信仰是什么样子，以一种能够创造文明、和平以及与我们的邻舍进行有意义对话的方式。经文选读来自诗篇第73章第1至3节以及第12至26节。

神实在恩待以色列那些清心的人，至于我，我的脚几乎失闪，我的脚险些滑跌。我见恶人和狂傲人享平安，就心怀不平。恶人就是这样，他们既是常享安逸，财宝便加增。我实在徒然洁净了我的心，徒然洗手表明无辜，因为我终日遭灾难，每早晨受惩治。

我若说，我要这样讲，这就是以奸诈待你的众子。我思索怎能明白这事，眼看实系为难，等我进了神的圣所，思想他们的结局。你实在把他们安在滑地，使他们掉在沉沦之中。他们转眼之间成了何等的荒凉，他们被惊恐灭尽了。人睡醒了怎样看梦，主啊，你醒了，也必照样轻看他们的影像。

因而我心里发酸，肺腑被刺，我这样愚昧无知，在你面前如畜类一般。然而我常与你同在，你搀着我的右手，你要以你的训言引导我，以后必接我到荣耀里。除你以外，在天上我有谁呢？除你以外，在地上我也没有所爱慕的。我的肉体和我的心肠衰残，但神是我心里的力量，又是我的福分，直到永远。这是神的话语。

那么，我们正在进行一个名为"公开的信仰，分享内心的盼望"的系列。我们生活在一个不鼓励人们公开自己的信仰、自己的宗教信念的西方社会中。我们被告知这是私人的事情，我们不应该谈论它，但讽刺的是，我们的文化实际上鼓励我们对其他所有事情都绝对开放和公开，其他所有事情，包括性，

因为这就是我们的本质。但没有什么比你的宗教信仰、比你最深层的信仰更能体现你是谁，因此我们作为一个社会面临的挑战是：我们如何能够诚实地面对自己是谁，这意味着我们如何能够公开我们的信仰，同时又以一种尊重并支持和平的方式来做到这一点。所以我们都必须学习这一点，而我们在这个系列中所做的事情之一就是讨论这个问题。

现在，如果我们要成为一个成熟的社会，能够谈论信仰，我们也必须能够知道如何谈论怀疑。在这方面，我们从宗教人士或世俗人士那里都得不到多少帮助。宗教人士倾向于把怀疑看作是一件非常糟糕的事情，一件可怕的事情，在许多宗教人士周围，表达怀疑感觉并不安全。但另一方面，许多世俗人士，特别是在像纽约市这样的地方，许多人相信永恒的怀疑、持续的怀疑、深刻的怀疑主义是唯一成熟且理智的立场。然而，圣经看待怀疑的方式既不像世俗人士那样积极，也不像宗教人士那样消极。

圣经并没有说怀疑像世俗人士说的那样积极，或者像宗教人士说的那样消极。因为实际上怀疑并不是那么简单化的，它不全是好的，也不全是坏的，只有当你开始以一种细致入微的方式看待它时，怀疑才能真正成为我们取得进步的途径。现在，为了理解圣经对此的看法，我们将看这首非常著名的诗篇，这段非常著名的经文。我们已经读了开头和结尾，为了节约起见，我们省略了中间的某些部分，我会提到那部分。这段经文非常丰富，它是一个人的案例研究，他的名字叫亚萨，这位诗篇作者，一个人经历怀疑的过程，他如何穿越那种怀疑实际上达到了更高层次的信仰，尽管这可能不完全相同，他的处境可能不完全与你的相同。

然而，圣经关于怀疑所说的基本原则，我实际上认为圣经对此的看法几乎是独特的。我不知道是否

在其他任何地方寻找，怀疑既不是那么好也不是那么坏，而是这种微妙的、多维度的东西，没有比这里更好的地方能找到这种圣经的观点了。所以让我们在这段经文中从三个标题来看怀疑。它是什么？什么导致了它？

什么能转化它？它是什么？什么导致了它？什么能转化它？那么它是什么？

用来形容怀疑的隐喻在第二节。对我来说的第二节，我的脚几乎滑倒，我几乎失去了立足点。现在这是一个很好的形象。当你失去立足点时，有那么一刻你失去了平衡，当你失去平衡时，你正在经历某种眩晕，一种迷失方向的感觉，你知道的，某种头晕。新约中有一个希腊词用来形容怀疑，die-psychos，意思是dipsychos，意思是两个psyches（心灵），基本上意味着精神上的复视。

如果你有复视，这意味着你的眼睛没有给你的大脑提供足够的信息来知道该把脚放在哪里。当你不太确定该把脚放在哪里时，就有一种不确定性，这就是怀疑。在属灵上，这是一种不确定性。你失去了你之前可能拥有的确定性，这就是怀疑。现在，从这里一开始的介绍中，我们立即就能学到关于怀疑的什么？

答案是，首先，我们了解到任何人都可能有怀疑。因为尽管我们对亚萨不太了解，我们不知道这个人的太多信息，这篇诗篇的作者，但他仍然是圣经的作者。这是一个相当高的属灵成就水平，你不觉得吗？这里有一个写圣经的人，受到神圣的默示。然而，这里有一个人，尽管他达到了这样的属灵水平，却充满了怀疑。

他说，我几乎失去了我的立足点，这意味着我几乎失去了我的信仰之握。所以任何人都可能有怀疑。但我们学到的另一件事，几乎立即，只是通过快速阅读，就是怀疑可以是一件积极的事情。这里你有的怀疑，到书的结尾，对不起，到诗篇的结尾，将会导致更高层次的信仰，以及一些最著名的

肯定的话语，我的肉体和我的心肠虽然衰残，但神是我心里的力量，又是我的福分，直到永远。换句话说，这里已经有进步了。

现在，信仰引导的想法，不好意思，是怀疑和质疑引导进步的想法，不应该那么奇怪。弗朗西斯·培根，几百年前最早的现代科学家之一，他是早期的现代科学家之一，在某个地方说过，他有点夸大其词，但他说得对。如果你从确定性开始，你将以怀疑结束。如果你从怀疑开始，你将以确定性结束。他真正想说的是，作为一名科学家，他说，如果你看看现在人们所接受的东西，如果你不质疑它，如果你只是接受别人告诉你的一切，你永远不会成长。

你永远不会成长到新的理解领域。如果你只是接受事物，不，不，科学方法是基于怀疑的。提出问题。保持怀疑。不要接受事物。

他想说的是，如果你从确定性开始，你实际上会发现你实际上学不到那么多，如果你从没有确定性开始，你学到的更多。所以这显然在任何探究领域都是如此。但在灵性上也是真实的。圣经中谈论怀疑最著名的地方是多疑的多马。多马是十二个门徒之一，在耶稣基督死后，他和门徒们有一次聚会，耶稣出现了。

复活的耶稣出现并显示他还活着。问题是多马错过了那次聚会。你知道，记得几年前我听到一位牧师说，在以赛亚书第六章，以赛亚上到圣殿，他看见主高高在上，他的衣裳垂下，遮满圣殿，有天使说，圣哉，圣哉，圣哉，以赛亚就仆倒在地，如同死了一样。我记得那位牧师说，当然，他去了教会，而他最没想到会在那里见到的人就是神。同样，多马也是对你的一个警告，永远不要错过教会。

你永远不知道。耶稣可能会出现。耶稣可能会出现而你错过了他。所以我承认，这通常不会发生，但有时确实会发生。现在，当多马听说耶稣已经

从死里复活了，所有的门徒都看见了他，多马却说，除非他向我显现，否则我不会相信。

而且我不仅要看见他，还要看见他手上的钉痕，我还要把手指放进钉痕里。耶稣做了什么呢？耶稣向多马显现了。值得注意的是，他并没有说，多马，你为什么质疑我？你知道，他说的第一句话是，好吧，你想看我的手。

你想看钉痕。它们在这里。把你的手指放进来。当然，多马以伟大的认信和肯定作为回应，这在某种程度上是约翰福音的高潮。他说，我的主，我的神，在约翰福音中，没有任何地方有人直接看着耶稣基督说，你是神。

换句话说，这个怀疑，这个怀疑的表达，把耶稣带进了多马的生命中，并引导多马达到了一个比他没有质疑时更高的信仰肯定。如果他没有提出问题，如果他没有怀疑。然而，耶稣并没有简单地，一方面，耶稣没有说，你怎么敢质疑我。他给了多马他所要求的。另一方面，他最后说，所以多马，停止怀疑，开始相信。

你看，这就是耶稣向我们展示的，圣经向我们展示的对怀疑的态度，这是宗教人士和世俗人士都没有的态度。它没有宗教人士说的那么糟糕，也没有世俗人士说的那么好。他说，看，不要默许你的怀疑。让怀疑驱使你走向别的东西，但与此同时，耶稣根本没有压制这些怀疑。所以对怀疑以及它带来的眩晕和失衡有一些重要的理解，但也可以是积极的。

其次，是什么导致了这个人的怀疑？现在他指出了两件事。首先，他说，我看见了某些东西，其次，他说，我经历了某些东西。他看见了什么？第1、2和3节简要地说明了这一点。

神是良善的。神善待那些内心纯洁的人。这是关于神的教义。这是传统的圣经神学教义。神是良善的神。

他关心内心纯洁的人。这并不意味着无罪。

这意指那些委身于神的人。所以他以好的神学作为开始。神是良善的神，他关怀那些内心纯洁的人。

但在第3节那里,经文说，我看见恶人兴旺。然后第4到11节，为了节省时间我们没有读到的经文，说了这样的事情。他正在观察恶人。这是什么意思呢？他们没有挣扎。

他们的身体健康强壮。这是第4到11节的内容。他们摆脱了人类共同的重担。他们不受人间疾病的困扰。他们用暴力、用傲慢包裹自己。

他们威胁压迫。他们说，神怎能知道？至高者有知识吗？现在，诗篇作者亚萨所说的是，在这个宇宙中，在这个世界上，在神的治理之下，据说在一位良善的神之下，那些抬举自己的人、那些操纵他人的人、那些剥削他人的人，正过着美好的生活。顺便说一句，这不仅仅发生在那时。

事实是，这个世界就是这样：骄傲的、自我抬举的、无情的、善于操纵的、自我中心的、剥削性的行为，能让你赚很多钱，能让你相当成功，能帮助你攀上权力的阶梯。所以他所说的，并不是什么我们从未见过的事情。而他为此感到困扰。他说，为什么一位良善的神，一位据说掌管这个世界的良善的神，会允许这种不公义，允许有权势的人压迫穷人和边缘化的人？这是第一件事。

但这不仅仅是一个智识上的问题。因为他不只是看见某些事，他亲身经历了某些事。第13、14、16节，他说，我实在是徒然洁净了我的心，徒然洗手表明无辜。我终日遭灾难，每早晨受惩治。现在，告诉我这听起来是不是很熟悉。

基本上，他在说，听着，我试图保持纯洁。我的理解是，神关怀内心纯洁的人。所以我试图保持我的心纯洁。我洗手表明无辜，但这似乎是徒然的。因为我终日遭灾难，每早晨受惩治。

我们不知道那些是什么，但重点是他的生活充满了如此多的坏事以至于

几乎每天他都感觉醒来就发现有新的事情出了问题。最后，他在第16节中说，当我试图理解这一切时，这让我深感困扰。换句话说，他不仅仅是遇到了一个智力上的问题，他正在经历一个个人的体验。而这个个人体验意味着他用头脑相信的那些事情，现在对他的心来说并不那么真实了，比如上帝的爱和良善。现在，这就是我们学到的。

让我们从这里跳出来，因为你可能会说，好吧，那不完全是我的问题。好的，小心点。不要在这些细节里迷失了。我们稍微跳出来一点，站得更高一些。我们看到的是，怀疑来自于理性和逻辑推理与个人经历的结合。

或者让我这样说，所有的信仰，以及所有的怀疑，我们所有的怀疑，以及我们所有的信仰信念，总是一个产物，不仅仅是思考和推理，而是思考和推理与逻辑和智力思想的结合，以及社会和个人经历的结合。怎么说呢？好吧，让我们谈谈这个。我们这样说是什么意思？首先，社会和个人经历，社会经历，有一整个社会学领域，你知道的，叫做知识社会学。

知识社会学本质上是这样说的，如果在很大程度上，我们认为我们是通过思考和推理来形成信念的，但在很大程度上，我们发现那些我们希望他们喜欢我们的人的信念最为可信。我能再说一遍吗？我正在把一整门知识社会学课程浓缩下来，你们中有些人为此花了几千美元，如果你们先来这里的话，你们本可以省下那笔钱，然后说，哦，我明白了，好的，就是这样。你倾向于发现那些你希望他们喜欢你的人的信念最为可信。我们有某些圈子想要成为其中的一部分，我们有某些社交场合想要被包括在内。

我们有一些人，我们认为，这些是我们的人，这些是我想被认同的那类人。而且出于某种奇怪的原因，那些人的信念对我们来说似乎就是比其他人的信念更可信。

人们的"为什么"，因为我们不仅仅是装在容器里的大脑。我们是社会性的生物，我们不仅仅是理性的生物。因此，我们与谁交往以及他们说什么，对我们认为什么是可信的和合理的有着巨大的影响。所以你的社会经历不仅与形成你的信念有很大关系，也与形成你的怀疑有很大关系，但还有个人经历，你看，我们的信念不仅仅是推理的产物，它们也是个人经历的产物。

你可能读了一本书，你可能上了一门课，人们在其中说，美国共和国的建国文件是完全正确的，人人生而平等。种族是平等的，个体是平等的，每个人都有平等的尊严。但如果你，如果你遇到了某个特定种族或国籍的两三个成员，而你从未遇到过该种族或国籍的其他任何人，而那些人对你很刻薄，他们对你很刻薄，他们对你很残忍，他们对你很残忍，这是你唯一见过的三个人，我想让你知道，无论书上说什么，你都会有一种发自内心的消极的个人感觉，觉得那些人有问题。你看，换句话说，你的种族态度和你的信念在很大程度上是由个人经历决定的，你看，这是不可避免的，因为我们不仅仅是理性的生物，我们不仅仅是机器人，我们不仅仅是计算机，我们既是社会性的存在，也是个人性的存在，同时也是理性的存在，因此你的信念以及你的怀疑来自思考和经历的结合，这意味着如果你处于怀疑中，如果你正在怀疑你曾经确信的东西，那是因为理性和个人经历的结合现在使这些信念对你的心来说变得不真实了。那么这有什么关系呢？

你说，嗯，这就是它的关系所在，这就是为什么我认为它很重要的原因。一方面，我希望你避免陷入两个相反的错误之一。一个错误是认为如果你对基督教产生了怀疑，这严格来说是一个智力问题。你看，这不是很讨人喜欢，不是吗？

承认我们在多大程度上受到社会塑造，经历在多大程度上塑造了我们，假设你在教会中长大，在基督教信仰中成长，然后你去了某个真正优秀的精英学术机构，你周围的每个人，你所有的朋友，所有你想融入的人，你所有的教授都在嘲笑传统的宗教信仰。

然后你拿起一本书，读了西格蒙德·弗洛伊德的《幻觉的未来》，然后说，哦，这让我确信基督教不是真的，真的是这样吗？拜托，不仅仅是这样，你知道的，事情不是这样运作的，没有人是这样运作的。你的社会环境让你觉得西格蒙德·弗洛伊德所说的相当可信。所以我不是说他没有好的论据，我只是想说，认识到这样一个事实：你不仅仅是，你的怀疑不仅仅是理智上的。它们也是个人性的，好吗？

但另一方面，不要认为你不能推理、不能思考，不要陷入另一个极端，就是说，好吧，我们所有的信念都只是我们文化的产物。你知道，你来自马达加斯加，你来自加拿大，你来自这里，你来自那里，你是这个种族，当然你会相信那个，因为我们所有的信念都是社会建构的，因此，你知道，没有，事情就是这样。彼得·伯格，一位知识社会学的先驱，几年前写了一本小书叫《天使的传闻》，在那本书里，他有一个很棒很棒的小章节叫做《相对化那些相对主义者》。在其中他说，在我的领域，已经通过实证证明人们在他们的信念上非常非常受到他们的文化和社会位置的塑造。他说，但在我的领域，有时人们常说，所有信念都是社会建构的，因此，你不能相信它。

每个人都只是他们文化的产物，每个人都只是他们社会环境的产物，所以你不能相信他们的信念，所有信念都是社会建构的。他说，这个陈述唯一的问题是这个陈述本身就是一个信念。如果

所有信念都是社会建构的且不可信，那么这个信念本身也是你社会处境的产物,它也不可能是真的。如果它不可能是真的,那么并非所有信念都是社会建构的。相对主义总是自我吞噬。

那么我们剩下什么呢?哦,他说,我们很好。我们剩下的是,我们应该对自己持谦卑、谨慎的看法。我们应该意识到在很大程度上我们并不客观,在很大程度上我们不喜欢跳出我们社会环境的框框来思考。然而我们必须这样做,因为彼得·伯格说,最终,你面对所有这些相互竞争的真理主张,我们不能说我们只是社会建构的,因此,我们无法不持有某种信念,因为那种信念也会是社会建构的。

因此,最终,我们仍然必须说这些信念中哪一个是真的。我们仍然必须思考。不要只是说,嗯,我只是有偏见。为什么?嗯,我遇到的那个种族的三个人都对我刻薄和残忍。

那么,想一想,你觉得也许在你的种族里可能也有三个残忍的人吗?你不认为有可能某人可能遇到你种族中的三个残忍的人,然后认为你们所有人都是那样吗?思考!所以一方面,你的怀疑不仅仅来自思考,但另一方面,你仍然必须思考。如果你要处理这些怀疑,好吧,那么他是如何处理这些怀疑的呢?

怀疑如何成为他不会困在其中的东西,而是本质上他用来将自己提升到一个全新水平的东西?什么改变了?三件事。这不应该完全让你惊讶,因为我们刚才谈到过。经验、思考和对神更宏大的认识。经验、思考和对神更宏大的认识,好的,首先,经验。

这将有点反直觉,但转折发生在哪里呢?你知道,第1到16节,他受压迫,我试图理解这一切,这让我深深困扰,然后第17节,直到——转折就在那里。事情开始在那里转变,发生了什么?这是他做的第一件事,直到我进入神的圣所。然后我明白了他们最终的命运。

现在，不要犯这个错误，不要以为他是说，好吧，他沿着路走着，看到我们纽约的那些宏伟美丽的大教堂之一，你注意到门开着，里面看起来很美，所以你就走进去，这是一个美丽的圣所，你坐下来,就只是思考一下。他说的不是这个地方。你知道为什么吗？因为唯一的圣所应该是圣殿。而在圣殿里发生的是什么呢？

敬拜。他去参加了一场敬拜聚会。他听到了神话语的歌唱，他听到了神的话语被宣讲，他听到人们歌唱，他被信徒们围绕着。你说，嗯，这是一件奇怪的事情要做，不，这不奇怪。原因如下。

这很公平，如果你承认，我不知道你怎么会做不到这一点，如果你承认你的怀疑并不是严格地通过思考产生的，那么你也不会严格地通过思考来度过你的怀疑。如果你的怀疑，在某种程度上，是因为你处在一些社交和个人的环境中，在那里神似乎不那么真实，那么公平起见，就应该平衡这个竞技场，去一些神似乎更真实的地方。去一个人们相信他的地方，去一个人们谈论他的地方，去一个有艺术的地方，去一个有教导的地方。换句话说，至少，要祷告。

你说，嗯，我不理解，我的意思是，如果你对神有怀疑，你怎么能向他祷告呢？

我不知道，有很多人对我有过怀疑，他们来找我谈论这件事，这帮助了我们的关系。你知道，我宁愿你不要坐在那里想，嗯，我觉得他是什么样的？我的意思是，我不知道，也许他是这样的，也许他是那样的，好吧，来问我吧。你知道，让我们谈谈这件事。同样地，为什么，为什么如果你是通过思考和经验的结合而偏离了信仰，你不应该通过不仅仅是思考，而是经验的结合来回到信仰或通过信仰呢？

他不只是离开去思考，他进入了圣所，所以这是第一件事。他愿意

他自己进入一个神看起来对他真实的经验性场所,这样他就可以清空思绪,因为他说,直到我进入神的圣所,然后我才明白他们的命运,这就引出了第二件事。第二件事是他确实进行了一些思考,而且是一些深刻的思考。这里面的内容比我能讲的更多,你知道,每次我讲这个,我都在想,也许我会讲得更久一点,多给你们一些内容。不,我真的不能,但我仍然想向你们展示他所做的两件事。

他思考这个问题的两种深刻方式。第一种是他愿意承认自己不好的动机。注意在一开始,他谈论他看到的所有这些不公正。你知道,为什么有权势的人压迫边缘化的人?但注意他说的话,即使在一开头,他也愿意坦诚。

他说,至于我,我的脚几乎滑跌,我差点失去立足之地,因为我嫉妒傲慢的人。这不是很有趣吗?他不是,他在这里说的是,这不仅仅是一个智力问题。我心怀怨恨,因为我觉得,我也想拥有那种权力。我也想拥有那种财富。

他在情感上非常投入,这就是为什么他说,等一下。我保持我的心纯洁,我洗净了我的双手,我应得他们所拥有的。他在这里愿意承认的是,再次说明,他不仅仅是有一个智力上的问题。这不是完全客观的,而是他的动机,他的动机也参与其中,或者这样说。你永远不会承认,不,除非你承认你发现很难相信X是真的,部分原因是因为你不希望X是真的。

看,除非你承认你发现很难相信X是真的的部分原因是因为你不希望它是真的,否则你永远不会真正正视这个信念的利弊。你永远不会真正做到智力上的诚实。托马斯·内格尔,他是纽约大学的一位哲学教授,非常杰出的哲学家,我出于很多原因对这个人极为尊敬。但几年前,他在一本叫《最后一句话》的书中写道,尽管他是一个无神论者,而且他

一个坚定的无神论者，他为此进行了非常雄辩的论证。然而，在这本书中，他写下了这样的话。

他说，我想谈谈对宗教的恐惧。我从经验出发，因为我自己也深受这种恐惧的影响。我希望无神论是真的。哦，这不仅仅是我不相信上帝，并且自然地希望我的信念是对的。而是我希望没有上帝。

我不想有上帝存在。我不想宇宙是那样的，然后他在一个小脚注中补充道。然而，我很好奇，是否有任何人对是否有上帝真正漠不关心。现在，他的意思是，这也是我所说的意思，这是一种如此的智识诚实。他说，他跟无神论者交谈，他们说，我之所以是无神论者，唯一的原因是我非常客观地审视了所有证据，然后我判断证据显示没有上帝。

他说，听着，在这件事上没有人是客观的。当然，你可以说，基督徒是那些想要相信来世的人。他们想要相信上帝。他们相信自己会与所爱的人永远在一起。但他在这里说的是，无神论者知道，如果有上帝存在，他们就不能按照自己想要的方式生活。

他说，我不想宇宙是那样的。我不想我的自由受到那种限制。因此他说，没有人是客观的，就像没有人是客观的。你有很多不想让上帝存在的理由。你也有一些想让祂存在的理由。

所以承认它。你看，这种智识上的诚实是至关重要的。承认你的动机。承认你并不是真的那么客观。承认它。

这并不意味着你可能不会仍然得出原来的结论，但你应该认识到这一点。所以首先，他审视了自己的动机，但第二件事是这样的。他开始认识到隐藏在所有怀疑中的深层信念。隐藏在所有怀疑中、嵌入其中的深层信念。看，我认为这是他看到的最深刻的东西。

这不是那么容易一下子就看到的，直到你把这些东西放在一起。注意他在一开始是怎么说的，在转变的一开始，不是在最一开始，而是他说，直到我进入

神的圣所，然后我明白了他们的最终结局。这里是关键，引用一下，这是他所看到的主要内容。你把他们放在滑溜的地方。现在，记住这里的比喻吗？

这是一个比喻。你的脚在滑动，你的脚在打滑。他已经用过这个比喻了。这是什么的比喻呢？你的脚所在的地方就是你信仰所在的地方。

你信仰的对象。因此，当你的脚打滑时，意味着你在努力保持你的信仰。现在，他转过身来，他说，不，等一下，等一下。他们的脚也在某个地方。他们也有信仰。

而他们信仰所在的地方比我信仰所在的地方更加不稳固。这是什么意思呢？好吧，别忘了。记得吗，我已经给你们读过一次了，是第11节。没有读出来，没有打印出来。

但在第11节中，在描述这些人，这些压迫者时，他们说，神怎么会知道呢？至高者有知识吗？看，这些生活非常自私的人，他们很残酷，他们剥削他人，他们这样做是基于对神的一种看法。他们说，神怎么会知道呢？至高者有知识吗？

这意味着什么呢，他们假设要么没有神，要么有一位神但不会审判我。换句话说，他们假设要么神不存在，要么神不在乎。要么没有神，要么是某种泛神论的力场式的神，不会因为我如何生活而审判我。那么，他们的生活是基于一种对神的看法，而这种看法他们无法证明。如果你的生活，如果你在生活方式中假设一种你无法证明的对神的看法，那是什么？

那是信心。那就是信心。看，也许你无法证明神的存在，但你也无法证明神不存在。你无法证明没有一位会审判你的神。因此，当你的生活就好像那位神不存在一样，那是一种信心的行为。

你在拿你的永恒命运打赌，赌神要么不存在，要么不是一位在乎的神。布莱士·帕斯卡，他著名的帕斯卡赌注就谈到了这一点。如果你听说过帕斯卡赌注，如果你听说过或者如果你听过

它被呈现的方式，你可能听到的都是最糟糕的呈现方式。我从未听到过真正有力的呈现方式，除非你自己阅读并思考它。帕斯卡想要表达的是这样的：当然，如果你相信上帝，这是一种信心的跨越。

但如果你不相信上帝，或者你的生活就好像上帝不存在一样，那同样也是一种信心的跨越。那是一个巨大的信心跨越。无论你如何生活，你的生活都基于一种你无法证明的对上帝的看法，因此每个人都在凭信心生活。不仅如此，为什么在这里的结尾，他说：除你以外，在天上我有谁呢？除你以外，地上我也没有所爱慕的。

我的肉体和我的心肠衰残，但上帝是我心里的力量，又是我的福分，直到永远。他为什么这样说？他说的是，福分是你的产业，福分是你的，是你的财富，是你的保障。当他说上帝是我的福分时，他是在把他的福分和他们的福分进行比较。你看，如果上帝是你的福分，如果上帝是你为之而活的对象，如果上帝的爱是你为之而活的，没有人能从你那里夺走这个。

但如果财富是你为之而活的，如果权力是你为之而活的，就像那些他曾如此羡慕的人一样，那可以在一瞬间被夺走。他们把信心放在权力、金钱、成就、名声，或者别的什么东西上。他们把信心，把脚，把灵魂安放在某样可以永远被夺走的东西上，就那么快。因此他说，等一等，等一等。我这里充满了怀疑，但我意识到另一种选择——记住，他羡慕他们，这意味着他实际上在思考像他们那样生活会是什么样子。

他突然意识到，要让我像他们那样生活，意味着我必须把信心放在没有上帝这个我无法证明的观点上。而且我必须把我的灵魂安放在这些东西上，它们会永远被夺走，等一等。他们处在一个比我更滑溜的地方。他们的信心根基更不牢固，而且他们也在凭信心生活。所以他看到了，在内心深处

在他的怀疑中，在他怀疑的核心，他开始说，也许我会像这些人一样生活，而不是按照我一直以来的方式生活，但那需要信心。

那需要巨大的信心。他说，不，不，不，不，我拥有的信心更好。你明白他在做什么吗？这就是为什么谢尔登·范诺肯在他的《严厉的怜悯》一书中，当他谈论自己如何成为基督徒时，首先，他谈到了这样一个事实：他意识到要成为一名基督徒，我必须相信耶稣基督，他不喜欢这样，因为他想要确定性，但他没有得到，这就是他所说的。

他说，我看到了可能与被证明之间的鸿沟。我该如何跨越它？如果我要把整个生命押在复活的基督身上，我想要证据，我想要确定性，我想要天空中燃烧的字母。所以，他在退缩，但后来他说，这是他说的话，但后来我意识到，哦，我的天哪，在我身后也有一道鸿沟，是的，我必须跳跃，你知道，接受耶稣基督需要信心的跳跃，因为我无法证明基督是神，但天哪，我也没有证据证明他不是。这是无法忍受的。

我无法在没有巨大信心的情况下拒绝耶稣。一旦我意识到这一点，一旦我意识到要跳过我身后的鸿沟需要信心，我就把自己投向了我面前的鸿沟，奔向耶稣。现在，这是最后一件事，这是极其有趣和重要的。这个人扩展了他的视野，他不只是经历，他不只是思考。他扩展了他对神的看法。

托马斯·库恩写了一本名为《科学革命的结构》的书，非常非常著名的书，他试图说的是，我们所有人都有范式，我们有关于生活的思维方式，当范式接收到一些它无法解释的数据时，我们就会产生怀疑。当它无法解释时，就会发生范式转变，这意味着你经历了出来，但然后你扩展了范式，使它能够解释你无法理解的数据。例如，我曾经在小孩子身上看到过这种情况，非常小的孩子，通常在他们成长的过程中，他们信任成年人，因为他们接触到的唯一成年人

在他们的生活中是他们的父母，或者有一些人，也许是阿姨、叔叔和他们的保姆之类的。他们期望所有的成年人都能自我控制，做到这一点。在某个时刻，小孩子会看到一个成年人做一些她从来没有想到过的事情，成年人居然会做这种事。

然后妈妈不得不坐下来说，现在，亲爱的，我必须让你明白一件事，你的人生理论，你对人性的范式太小了，我的意思是，你才四岁。你没有想到成年人会这样做，但是，亲爱的，成年人真的会这样做。所以正在发生的事情是，她正在经历一个范式转变。她的人生理论太小了，无法处理这个现实。我希望你考虑这一点，当疑惑进入你的生活时，那是因为你对上帝的理解太小，无法处理它。

克服它的方法不仅仅是简单地回到你之前相信的方式，你必须对上帝有一个更广阔的视角，一个更大的视角，这正是他在这里所做的。你知道它的核心在哪里吗？就在这里，第21节、22节和23节，抱歉，更正一下。当我的心悲伤，我的灵痛苦时，我是愚昧无知的，我在你面前如同畜类一样，然而我常与你同在。你搀着我的右手。

看这里，他改变了你对上帝的看法。当他谈到自己像畜类时，我像野兽一样。让我给你讲两个小故事。伊丽莎白·艾略特，传教士和作家，曾经讲过一个真实的故事，关于她如何拜访一些农民，一些牧羊人，基本上是北威尔士高地的牧羊农场主。她发现，每年有一次，他们必须把羊带去，浸泡在一大桶杀虫剂里，否则昆虫会真的把羊吃掉。

但这对羊来说非常艰难，因为你必须抓住羊的四只脚，这里的前腿和后腿，像这样把它们浸下去，你知道，就是让它们完全浸没大约15秒钟左右。我想让你知道，即使这正是羊所需要的，它们没有一只喜欢这样。只是想让你知道这一点。当伊丽莎白

埃利奥特看着这段话，她把自己想象成一只羊，而主是我的牧者，她说，你知道吗，上帝经常对我们这样做。祂给我们真正需要的东西，尽管我们可能在10年、20年、30年、40年之后才知道，或者可能要等到死后才明白。

你看，这个人突然意识到，等一下，如果我真的相信上帝，一个创造世界的上帝，祂当然能够做我无法理解的事情，我怎么敢认为所有事情都必须按照我所想的方式发生呢。然后他意识到，我就是那只羊，我就像那个动物，而我没有信任我的主人。另一个故事是，多年前，我在一次野餐上，我记得这件事，有一只小猫掉进了一条溪流，一条非常冰冷的溪流，肯定会淹死。一个男孩走进去把小猫拉了出来，救了它。但当他把小猫拉出来时，小猫当然非常害怕，就一直咬和抓他的手，抓咬它救命恩人的手，直到流血。

这个人说的是，我心里忧伤，我的灵魂痛苦，我愚昧无知，我在你面前如同野兽一般。然而我却常与你同在，你牵着我的右手。他对上帝有了更大的认识，他让上帝足够伟大，可以做他无法理解的事情。他说，哎呀，我为什么不能拥有一个比我更伟大的上帝，一个能做我无法理解之事的上帝呢？所以他对上帝的认识变得更加宏大，同时也更加温柔，因为他说，你从未放弃过我。

你一直与我同在，你仍然牵着我的右手。尽管我是如此愚蠢，尽管我如何咬你、抓你，你却继续爱我，对我忠诚。所以当他对上帝的认识变得更宏大、更温柔时，结果是，他能够应对他周围看到的生活了。现在，我想问你的是，这是怎么发生的呢？他怎么能确定，尽管他对上帝如此粗暴，尽管他一直在做这一切，他一直在质疑祂，他一直在对待上帝像

这样，他怎么能确信神仍然与他同在？

他怎么能确信神已经赦免了他？他怎么能确信神从未放手离开他？现在，我认为他无法确信，除非他是受圣灵感动来写圣经的一部分。这是神的启示，他就是知道，但你和我怎么能知道呢？为什么神不会在我们这样行事时——而我们确实这样行事——为什么神不会直接说，嘿，自然后果，就走你自己的路吧？

我们怎么知道神没有放弃我们？他不会放弃我们。我来告诉你怎么知道。我们没有神的直接启示，我们有，嗯，不是直接的，但我们有新约圣经，这就是我们所看到的。当耶稣基督在十字架上时，他呼喊道，我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？

你知道他在说什么吗？我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？当他说这话时，他是在说父啊，我感受不到你的手。看耶稣的一生，他与我们其他人完全不同。他从未对父亲像野兽般粗暴。

他始终对父亲忠诚。他从不质疑父亲。他始终爱着父亲。他是唯一配得神牵着他的手的人，但在他生命的尽头，神放开了他。他说，哦，我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？

为什么？为了我们，耶稣基督承受了你我应得的。他失去了父的手，这样你我就能知道，如果我们相信耶稣，并且因着耶稣所成就的被神接纳，他永远不会放开你。他永远不会离弃你。换句话说，我们对神的认识甚至比这个人更大。

他根本不知道神会如此伟大，以至于来到地上，来到地上成为一个人。然后走上十字架，为我们做这一切。我们对神的认识比他更大，对神的爱的认识也比他更深。因此，我们应该更能拥有一个宏大的神观来应对生活，比他更应该能说出他在结尾所说的话，在天上我有谁呢？除你以外，在地上我也没有所爱慕的。

我的肉体和我的心肠衰残，但神是我心里的力量，又是我的福分，直到永远。让我们祷告。

我们的父，我们祈求你通过我们的疑惑使我们变得伟大。我们祈求你通过我们的疑惑将我们提升到新的层次。但我们祈求你帮助我们知道如何处理我们的疑惑，我们已经从这段经文中得到了一些很好的指导。

但最重要的是，主啊，帮助我们看到，因着十字架，我们可以相信你不会放弃我们，你不会离开我们，即使我们很痛苦，即使我们在哭泣，即使我们在呼喊，即使我们充满疑惑。我们感谢你，我们是因着恩典得救，不是通过我们的善行，不是通过我们的确信程度。我们感谢你，我们是因着恩典通过耶稣得救，我们祈求你帮助我们因他所做的而在恩典中成长。愿这一切在我们的生命中成真并实现，我们奉耶稣的名祷告，阿门。

## Chinese Transcript / 中文

欢迎来到福音与生活！当谈到公开你的信仰时，你感觉有多自在？本月在播客中,蒂姆·凯勒探讨圣经关于公开信仰的教导。他向我们展示在多元化社会中公开我们的信仰是什么样子，以一种能与我们的邻居创造文明、和平和有意义对话的方式。经文是诗篇第73章第1至3节和第12至26节。

神实在恩待以色列那些清心的人。至于我，我的脚几乎失闪，我的脚险些滑跌。我见恶人和狂傲人享平安，就心怀不平。恶人是这样的，他们常享安逸，财宝便加增。我实在徒然洁净了我的心，徒然洗手表明无辜。因为我终日遭灾难，每早晨受惩治。

我若说我要这样讲，这就是以奸诈待你的众子。我思索怎能明白这事，眼看实系为难，等我进了神的圣所，思想他们的结局。你实在把他们安在滑地，使他们掉在沉沦之中。他们转眼之间成了何等的荒凉！他们被惊恐灭尽了。人睡醒了，怎样看梦，主啊，你醒了，也必照样轻看他们的影像。

因而我心里发酸，肺腑被刺。我这样愚昧无知，在你面前如畜类一般。然而我常与你同在，你搀着我的右手。你要以你的训言引导我，以后必接我到荣耀里。除你以外，在天上我有谁呢？除你以外，在地上我也没有所爱慕的。我的肉体和我的心肠衰残，但神是我心里的力量，又是我的福分，直到永远。这是神的话语。

所以，我们正在进行一个名为"公开信仰，分享内心盼望"的系列。我们生活在西方社会，这个社会不鼓励人们公开他们的信仰、他们的宗教信念。我们被告知这是私人的事情，不应该谈论，但讽刺的是，我们的文化实际上鼓励我们对其他所有事情都绝对开放和公开，包括性，因为那是我们的身份。但没有什么比你的宗教信念、你最深层的信仰更能定义你是谁了，因此，作为一个社会，我们面临的挑战是如何诚实地表达我们是谁，这意味着我们如何公开我们的信仰，同时以一种尊重和支持和平的方式去做。所以我们都必须学习这一点，我们在这个系列中做的事情之一就是谈论这个。

现在，如果我们要成为一个成熟的社会，能够谈论信仰，我们也必须知道如何谈论怀疑。宗教人士或世俗人士都没有在这方面给予我们太多帮助。宗教人士倾向于把怀疑看作是一件非常糟糕的事情，一件可怕的事情，在许多宗教人士周围，表达怀疑感觉不安全。但另一方面，许多世俗人士，特别是在像纽约这样的地方，许多人相信长期的怀疑、持续的怀疑、深度的怀疑主义是唯一成熟和理智成熟的立场。然而，圣经对怀疑的看法既不像世俗人士说的那么积极，也不像宗教人士说的那么消极。

圣经并不像世俗人士那样说它是积极的，也不像宗教人士那样说它是消极的。因为实际上怀疑并不是那么简单化的，它不全是好的，也不全是坏的，只有当你开始以一种细致入微的方式看待它时，怀疑实际上才能成为我们取得进步的东西。现在，为了理解圣经对此的说法，我们将看这首非常著名的诗篇，这段非常著名的经文。我们读了它的开头和结尾，为了节约起见，我们省略了中间的某些部分，我会提到的。它非常丰富，这是一个人的案例研究，他的名字叫亚萨，这位诗篇作者，一个人的怀疑经历，他如何度过那个怀疑，实际上达到了更高层次的信仰，即使它可能不完全相同，他的情况可能不完全与你的相同。

尽管如此，圣经关于怀疑的基本原则，我实际上认为圣经对此的说法几乎是独特的。我不知道还有哪里可以看到，怀疑既不那么好也不那么坏，而是这种微妙的、多维度的东西，没有比这里更好的地方来找到圣经的观点了。所以让我们在这段经文中从三个方面来看怀疑。它是什么？什么导致了它？

什么改变了它？它是什么？什么导致了它？什么改变了它？那么它是什么呢？

用来描述怀疑的比喻在第二节。至于我，我的脚几乎失闪，我的脚险些滑跌。现在这是一个很好的形象。当你失去立足点时，有那么一刻你失去了平衡，当你失去平衡时，你会经历某种眩晕，一种迷失方向，你知道，某种头晕。新约中有一个希腊词用来表示怀疑，"双魂"，意思是两个灵魂，基本上意味着属灵的双重视觉。

如果你有双重视觉，这意味着你的眼睛没有给你的大脑足够的信息来知道把你的脚放在哪里。当你不太确定把脚放在哪里时，就有一种不确定性，这就是怀疑。从灵性上讲，这就是这种不确定性。你失去了你以前可能拥有的确定性，这就是怀疑。现在，从这里的开头我们立刻对怀疑了解到什么呢？

答案是，首先，我们了解到任何人都可能有怀疑。因为即使我们对亚萨了解不多，我们不太了解这个家伙是谁，诗篇的作者，但他仍然是圣经的作者。这是相当高水平的灵性成就，你不觉得吗？这是一个写圣经的人，受神启示的。然而，这是一个人，尽管他的灵性成就水平很高，却充满了怀疑。

他说，我几乎失去了我的立足点，这意味着我几乎失去了我的信仰立足点。所以任何人都可能有怀疑。但我们几乎立即学到的另一件事，只需快速通读，就是怀疑可以是一件积极的事情。你有这样的怀疑，到诗篇结束时，抱歉，到诗篇结束时，将导致更高层次的信仰，以及一些最著名的肯定，"我的肉体和我的心肠衰残，但神是我心里的力量，又是我的福分，直到永远。"换句话说，这里已经有了进步。

现在，信仰导致，对不起，怀疑和质疑导致进步的想法不应该那么陌生。弗朗西斯·培根，几百年前最早的现代科学家之一，他是早期现代科学家之一，有一个地方他说，他有点夸大其词，但他是对的。如果你从确定性开始，你将以怀疑结束。如果你从怀疑开始，你会以确定性结束。他真正说的是，作为一名科学家，他说，如果你看看现在人们接受的东西，如果你不质疑它，如果你只是接受别人告诉你的一切，你永远不会成长。

你永远不会成长到新的理解领域。如果你只是接受事物，不，不，科学方法是建立在怀疑的基础上的。提问。要有怀疑精神。不要接受事物。

他说的是，如果你从确定性开始，你实际上会发现你实际上学不到那么多，如果你不从确定性开始，你会学到更多。所以这显然在任何探究领域都是如此。但在灵性上也是如此。圣经中谈论怀疑最著名的地方是怀疑的多马。多马是十二门徒之一，在耶稣基督死后，他去参加了一次门徒聚会，耶稣出现了。

复活的耶稣出现并表明他还活着。问题是多马错过了那次聚会。你知道，记得几年前我听到一位传道人说，在以赛亚书第六章，以赛亚上到圣殿，他看见主高高在上，他的衣裳垂下遮满圣殿，有天使说，圣哉，圣哉，圣哉，以赛亚倒在地上如同死了。我记得那位传道人说，当然，他去了教堂，他最不期望在那里见到的人就是神。同样，多马是对你的警告，永远不要错过教堂。

你永远不知道。耶稣可能会出现。耶稣可能会出现，而你错过了他。所以我承认，这通常不会发生，但有时会发生。现在，当多马听说耶稣已经从死里复活，所有门徒都说我们看见了他，多马说，我不会相信，除非他向我显现。

我不仅要看见他，而且要看到他手上的钉痕，我可以把我的手指放在钉痕里。耶稣做了什么？耶稣向多马显现。值得注意的是，他没有说，多马，你为什么质疑我？你知道，他说的第一件事是，好吧，你想看我的手。

你想要钉痕。在这里。把你的手指放进去。当然，多马以伟大的认信和肯定回应，在某种程度上，这是约翰福音的高潮。他说，我的主，我的神，在约翰福音中没有任何地方有人直接看着耶稣基督说，你是神。

换句话说，这个怀疑，这种怀疑的表达将耶稣带入多马的生命，并导致多马对信仰的更高肯定，比如果他没有提出怀疑会有的要高。如果他没有提出问题，如果他没有怀疑。然而，一方面，耶稣并不只是说，你怎么敢质疑我。他给了多马他所要求的。另一方面，他最后说，所以多马，不要再怀疑了，开始相信吧。

看，这就是耶稣向我们展示的，圣经向我们展示的对怀疑的态度，既不是宗教人士也不是世俗人士所持有的。它不像宗教人士说的那么糟糕，也不像世俗人士说的那么好。他说，看，不要默许你的怀疑。让怀疑驱使你去别的东西，但同时，耶稣根本不压制怀疑。所以对于怀疑以及它带来的眩晕和失衡有一些重要的理解，但也有积极的一面。

其次，是什么导致了这个人的怀疑？现在有两件事他指出。首先，他说，我看到了一些东西，其次，他说，我经历了一些东西。他看到了什么？第1、2和3节简要概括了。

神是良善的。神对清心的人是良善的。现在这是关于神的教义。这是圣经中关于神的传统教义。神是良善的神。

他关心清心的人。这并不意味着无罪。它意味着委身于神的人。所以他从良好的神学开始。神是良善的神，他关心清心的人。

但在第3节中，它说，我看到恶人享平安。然后第4到11节，为了节约起见我们没有读，说了这样的话。他在看着恶人。他是什么意思？他们没有挣扎。

他们的身体健康强壮。这是第4到11节。他们没有常人的重担。他们不受常人的疾病困扰。他们用暴力、傲慢包裹自己。

他们威胁压迫。他们说，神怎能知道？至高者岂有知识呢？现在，亚萨，这位诗篇作者说的是，在神之下，在这个宇宙中，在这个世界上，据说在一位良善的神之下，那些抬举自己、操纵他人、剥削他人的人，过着很好的生活。顺便说一句，这不仅仅是当时发生的事。

事实是，这个世界是这样的，骄傲的、自我抬举的、无情的、操纵的、自我中心的、剥削的行为，可以让你赚很多钱，可以让你相当成功，可以帮助你登上权力阶梯。所以他说的不是我们永远没见过的东西。他为此感到困扰。他说，为什么一位良善的神，一位据说良善的掌管这个世界的神，会允许那种不公正，允许强大的人压迫贫穷和边缘化的人？这是第一件事。

但这不仅仅是一个智力问题。因为他也，不仅仅是他看到了什么，他还经历了什么。亲身经历，第13、14、16节，他说，我实在徒然洁净了我的心，徒然洗手表明无辜。我终日遭灾难，每早晨受惩治。现在，告诉我这听起来是否熟悉。

基本上，他说，看，我努力保持纯洁。我的理解是神关心清心的人。所以我努力保持我的心纯洁。我洗手表明无辜，但这似乎是徒然的。因为我终日遭灾难，每早晨受惩治。

我们不知道它们是什么，但重点是他的生活充满了糟糕的事情，几乎每天他都觉得醒来就得知又有什么新的错误。最后，他在第16节说，我思索怎能明白这事，眼看实系为难。换句话说，他不仅仅有一个智力问题，他还有一个个人经历。那个个人经历意味着他在头脑中相信的事情现在对他的心来说不是很真实，比如神的爱和良善。现在，这是我们学到的。

让我们从中提取出来，因为你可能会说，嗯，那不完全是我的问题。好吧，小心。不要在细节中迷失。我们稍微跳出来，稍微提高一点。这是我们看到的，怀疑来自理性和理性思考与个人经历的结合。

或者让我这样说，所有的信仰，以及所有的怀疑，我们所有的怀疑，以及我们所有的信仰，总是产生于不仅仅是思考和推理，而是思考、推理、逻辑和智力思想的结合，以及社会和个人经历。怎么说呢？嗯，让我们谈谈这个。我们的意思是什么？首先，社会和个人经历，社会经历，有整个社会学领域，你知道，叫做知识社会学。

知识社会学基本上是这样说的，如果我们在很大程度上，我们认为我们通过思考和解决这些问题来得出我们的信念，但在很大程度上，我们发现那些我们希望喜欢我们的人的信念最合理。我能再说一次吗？我正在将整个知识社会学课程浓缩，你们中的一些人为此支付了数千美元，如果你先来这里，你本可以节省那笔钱，然后说，哦，我明白了，好的，就是这样。你倾向于发现那些你希望喜欢你的人的信念最合理。我们有某些我们想成为其中一部分的圈子，我们有某些我们想被包括在内的社会环境。

我们有一些人，我们认同，这些是我们的人，这些是我想被认同的那种人。出于某种奇怪的原因，这些人的信念对我们来说似乎比其他人的更合理，为什么，因为我们不仅仅是罐子里的大脑。我们是社会生物，我们不仅仅是理性生物。因此，我们与谁交往以及他们说什么对我们认为什么是可信和合理的有巨大影响。所以你的社会经历与形成你的信念有很大关系，也与形成你的怀疑有很大关系，但还有个人经历，看，我们的信念不仅仅是推理的产物，它们也是个人经历的产物。

你可能读一本书，你可能上一堂课，人们说，美国共和国的建国文件是绝对正确的，所有人都是平等创造的。种族是平等创造的，个人是平等创造的，每个人都有平等的尊严。但如果你，如果你遇到某个特定种族或国籍的两三个成员，而你从未见过那个种族或国籍的其他任何人，那些人对你很讨厌，他们对你很讨厌，他们对你很残忍，他们对你很残忍，你见过的唯一三个人，我想让你知道，无论书上怎么说，你都会有一种发自内心的负面个人感觉，认为那些人有问题。看，换句话说，你的种族态度和信念在很大程度上是由个人经历决定的，看，这是不可避免的，因为我们不仅仅是理性生物，我们不仅仅是机器人，我们不仅仅是计算机，我们是社会存在，个人存在以及理性存在，因此你的信念以及你的怀疑来自思考和经历的结合，这意味着如果你在怀疑，如果你怀疑你曾经确信的事情，那是因为理性和个人经历的结合现在使那些信念对你的心来说不真实了。现在那有什么关系呢？

你说，嗯，这是它的关系，这就是为什么它很重要，我认为非常重要。一方面，我希望你避免陷入两个相反的错误之一。一个错误是认为如果你对基督教产生了怀疑，这纯粹是一个智力问题。看，承认我们在多大程度上受到社会塑造，我们的经历在多大程度上塑造我们，这不是很令人愉快，是吗？让我们假设你在教堂长大，在基督教信仰中长大，然后你去了某个非常棒的精英学术机构，你周围的每个人，你所有的朋友，所有你想被包括在内的人，你所有的教授都在嘲笑传统的宗教信仰。

然后你拿起一本书，读西格蒙德·弗洛伊德的《幻觉的未来》，说，哦，那说服了我基督教不是真的，是吗？拜托，不仅仅是那个，你知道的，它不是那样运作的，没有人那样运作。你的社会环境为你准备好了，让你发现西格蒙德·弗洛伊德所说的相当合理。所以我不是说他没有好的论点，我只是想说，认识到你不仅仅是，你的怀疑不仅仅是智力上的。它们也是个人的，好吗？

但另一方面，不要认为你不能推理，你不能思考，不要陷入另一个极端，也就是说，嗯，我们所有的信念都只是我们文化的产物。你知道，你来自马达加斯加，你来自加拿大，你来自这里，你来自那里，你是这个种族，当然你会相信那个，因为你所有的信念都是社会建构的，因此，你知道，没有，就是这样。彼得·伯格，他是知识社会学的先驱，几年前写了一本小书叫《天使的谣言》，在那本书中，他有一个很棒的小章节叫《相对化相对主义者》。在其中他说，在我的领域，经验证明人们的信念在很大程度上受到他们的文化和社会位置的影响。他说，但在我的领域，有时人们会说，所有信念都是社会建构的，因此，你不能相信它。

每个人都只是他们文化的产物，每个人都只是他们社会环境的产物，所以你不能相信他们的信念，所有信念都是社会建构的。他说，这个陈述的唯一问题是这个陈述是一个信念。如果所有信念都是社会建构的，不能被信任，那么这个信念是你社会环境的产物，它不能是真的。如果它不能是真的，那么所有信念并不都是社会建构的。相对主义总是吃掉自己。

那么我们剩下什么？哦，他说，我们很好。我们剩下的是，我们应该对自己有谦卑、谦逊的看法。我们应该意识到在很大程度上我们不客观，在很大程度上我们不喜欢在我们社会环境的框框之外思考。然而我们必须这样做，因为彼得·伯格说，最终，你有所有这些竞争的真理声明，我们不能说我们只是社会建构的，因此，我们没有办法不能穿上一个信念，因为那个信念会是社会建构的。

因此，最终，我们仍然必须说这些信念中哪一个是真的。我们仍然必须思考。不要只是说，嗯，我只是有偏见的。为什么？嗯，我遇到的那个种族的三个人都对我刻薄和残忍。

嗯，想想，你认为也许在你的种族中可能有三个残忍的人吗？你不觉得有可能有人可能遇到你种族中的三个残忍的人，并认为你们所有人都是那样的吗？思考！所以一方面，你的怀疑不仅仅来自思考，但另一方面，你仍然必须思考。如果你要处理怀疑，好吧，那么他如何处理怀疑？

怀疑如何成为他不会陷入其中的东西，而是他基本上用来将自己提升到一个全新水平的东西？是什么改变了三件事？这不应该完全让你惊讶，因为我们刚刚谈到了它。经历、思考和对神的扩大视野。经历、思考和对神的扩大视野，好吧，首先，经历。

这会有点违反直觉，但转折发生在哪里？你知道，第1到16节，他很压抑，我思索怎能明白这事，眼看实系为难，然后第17节，直到有转折。事情在那里开始转变，发生了什么？这是他做的第一件事，直到我进了神的圣所。然后我明白了他们的结局。

现在，不要犯这个错误，不要认为他说的是，嗯，他在路上走，他看到我们在纽约有的这些大而美丽的大教堂之一，你注意到门开着，里面看起来很漂亮，所以你走进去，这是一个美丽的圣所，你坐下来，你只是思考。他说的不是那个。你知道为什么吗？因为唯一的圣所应该是圣殿。圣殿里发生什么？

敬拜。他去参加了一次敬拜聚会。他听到神的话语被歌唱，他听到神的话语被传讲，他听到人们唱歌，他被信徒包围。你说，嗯，那是一件奇怪的事情，不，这不是一件奇怪的事情。原因如下。

这是公平的，如果你承认，我不知道你怎么不这样做，如果你承认你的怀疑不是严格通过思考而来的，那么，你不会仅仅通过思考来克服你的怀疑。如果你的怀疑，在某种程度上，是因为你在社会和个人位置上，神看起来不那么真实，那么公平地说，应该平衡竞争环境，去一些神看起来更真实的地方。去一个人们相信他的地方，去一个人们谈论他的地方，去一个有艺术的地方，去一个有教导的地方。换句话说，至少，祷告。你说，嗯，我不明白，我的意思是，如果你对神有怀疑，你怎么能向他祷告？

我不知道，有很多人对我有怀疑，他们来和我谈论这件事，这帮助了关系。你知道，我宁愿你不要坐在那里想，嗯，我认为他是什么样的？我的意思是，我不知道，也许他是这样的，也许他是那样的，好吧，来问我。你知道，让我们谈谈这件事。同样，为什么，为什么如果你通过不是思考和经历的结合而远离信仰，你不应该通过不仅仅是思考，而是经历的结合回到信仰或通过信仰。

他不只是去思考，他进入了圣所，所以这是第一件事。他愿意把自己放在一个神对他来说似乎真实的经验位置，这样他就可以清理他的头脑，因为他说，直到我进了神的圣所，然后我明白了他们的命运，这进入了第二件事。第二件事是他确实做了一些思考，他在这里做了一些深刻的思考。这里面的内容比我能，你知道，我每次传讲这个，我一直在想，也许我会讲得更长一点，给你更多。不，我真的不能，但我仍然想向你展示他做的两件事。

他思考这个问题的两种深刻方式。一种是他愿意承认他的坏动机。注意在一开始，他谈论他看到的所有不公正。你知道，为什么强大的人在压迫边缘化的人？但注意他说什么，即使在一开始，他也愿意不诚实。

他说，至于我，我的脚几乎失闪，我的脚险些滑跌，因为我嫉妒狂傲人。这不是很有趣吗？他不，他在这里说的是，这不仅仅是一个智力问题。我很愤恨，因为我觉得，我想拥有那种权力。我想拥有那种财富。

他在这件事上非常情绪化，这就是为什么他说，等一下。我保持我的心纯洁，我洗手表明无辜，我应得他们拥有的。他在这里愿意承认的是，再次，他不仅仅有一个智力问题。这不是完全客观的，而是他的动机，他的动机参与其中，或者这样说。你永远不会承认，不，直到你承认你发现很难相信X是真的，部分原因是你不想X是真的。

看，直到你承认你发现很难相信X是真的的部分原因是因为你不想它是真的，你永远不会真正面对信念的利弊。你永远不会真正诚实地对待智力。托马斯·内格尔，他是纽约大学非常杰出的哲学教授，出于很多原因，我对这个人有极大的尊重。但几年前，他在一本名为《最后的话》的书中写道，尽管他是无神论者，他是一个确信的无神论者，他非常雄辩地为此辩护。然而，在这本书中，他写道。

他说，我想谈谈对宗教的恐惧。我从经验中说话，我自己也强烈地受到这种恐惧的影响。我希望无神论是真的。哦，不仅仅是我不相信神，自然地，我希望我的信念是对的。而是我希望没有神。

我不想有神。我不想宇宙是那样的，然后他在一个小脚注中补充说。然而，我很好奇，是否有人真正对是否有神漠不关心。现在，他的意思是，这就是我所说的，是这样的智力诚实。他说，他和无神论者交谈，他们说，我是无神论者的唯一原因是我非常客观地看了所有证据，我决定证据表明没有神。

他说，听着，没有人对此客观。当然，你可以说，嗯，基督徒是那些想相信来世的人。他们想相信他们相信神。他们将永远与他们所爱的人在一起。但他在这里说，但无神论者知道如果有神，他们就不能按照他们想要的方式生活。

他说，我不想宇宙是那样的。我不想对我的自由有那种限制。因此他说，没有人像没有人客观一样客观。你有很多理由不想神存在。你有一些理由想要他存在。

所以承认它。看，那种智力诚实是至关重要的。承认你的动机。承认你并不真的那么客观。承认它。

这并不意味着你可能不会仍然得出你原来的结论，但你应该认识到这一点。所以首先，他审视自己的动机，但这是第二件事。他开始认识到隐藏在所有怀疑中的深层信仰。隐藏在所有怀疑中自我隐藏的深层信仰。看，我认为这是他看到的最深刻的事情。

一开始不那么容易看到，直到你把这些东西放在一起。注意他在转折的一开始是如何说的，不是在一开始，但他说，直到我进了神的圣所，然后我明白了他们的结局。这是关键引用，这是他看到的主要内容。你把他们安在滑地。现在，记住这里的比喻吗？

这是一个比喻。你的脚在滑，你的脚在滑。他已经用过了。它是什么的比喻？你的脚在哪里就是你信仰的地方。

你信仰的东西。因此，当你的脚滑时，这意味着你在保持信仰方面遇到了麻烦。现在，他转身说，不，等一下，等一下。他们的脚也在某个地方。他们相信某些东西。

他们的信仰所在的地方比我信仰所在的地方更不稳固。这是什么意思？好吧，不要忘记。记住，我已经给你读过一次了，是第11节。没有读出来，没有打印出来。

但在第11节，在描述这些人，这些压迫性的人时，他们说，神怎能知道？至高者岂有知识呢？看，这些过着非常自私生活的人，他们很残忍，他们在剥削人，他们这样做是基于对神的一种看法。他们说，神怎能知道？至高者岂有知识呢？

这意味着，他们假设要么没有神，要么有一位不会审判我的神。换句话说，他们假设要么神不存在，要么神不关心。要么没有神，要么是某种泛神论的力场式的神，不会因为我的生活方式而审判我。那么，他们是基于对神的一种他们无法证明的看法而生活。如果你在生活，如果你在假设你的生活方式中，对神的一种你无法证明的看法，那是什么？

那就是信仰。那就是信仰。看，你也许无法证明神，但你无法证明没有神。你无法证明没有一位会审判你的神。因此，当你生活得好像那位神不存在时，那是一种信仰行为。

你在赌你的永恒命运，要么没有神，要么不是一位关心的神。布莱兹·帕斯卡，他著名的帕斯卡赌注谈到了这一点。如果你听说过帕斯卡赌注，如果你听说过它或听到它的陈述，你可能听到的是以可能最糟糕的方式陈述的。这总是，我从未听过它以一种真正强有力的方式陈述，如果你阅读它并思考它，它真的很强大。帕斯卡试图说的是，当然，如果你相信神，这是一个信仰的步骤。

但如果你不相信神，或者如果你生活得好像神不存在，那也是一个信仰的步骤。那是一个巨大的信仰步骤。无论你如何生活，你都在基于对神的一种你无法证明的看法来建立你的生活，因此每个人都在凭信仰生活。不仅如此，但为什么，在这里的结尾，他说，除你以外，在天上我有谁呢？除你以外，在地上我也没有所爱慕的。

我的肉体和我的心肠衰残，但神是我心里的力量，又是我的福分，直到永远。他为什么这样说？他说的是一个福分是你的继承，一个福分是你的东西，什么是你的财富，是你的安全。对他来说，说神是我的福分，他在比较他的福分和他们的福分。看，如果神是你的福分，如果神是你为之而活的东西，如果神在他的爱中是你为之而活的，没有人能夺走它。

但如果财富是你为之而活的，如果权力是你为之而活的，就像他如此嫉妒的这些人一样，那可以在一瞬间被夺走。他们是那些把信仰放在权力、金钱、成就、声誉上的人，无论什么。他们把信仰，他们把脚，他们把灵魂安放在可以永远被夺走的东西上，就像那样快速。因此他说，等一下，等一下。我在这里充满怀疑，然而我意识到另一种选择，记住，他嫉妒他们，这意味着他实际上在想像他们一样生活会是什么样子。

他突然意识到，我要像他们一样生活意味着我必须相信没有神，而我无法证明这一点。我必须把我的灵魂安放在这些可以永远被夺走的东西上，等一下。他们在一个比我更滑的地方。他们的信仰根基更不牢固，他们在凭信仰生活。所以他看到，在他怀疑的核心，在他怀疑的核心，他开始说，也许我会像这些人一样生活，而不是我一直生活的方式，但那需要信仰。

那需要巨大的信仰。他说，不，不，不，不，我拥有的信仰更好。你明白他在做什么吗？这就是为什么谢尔登·瓦努肯在他的书《严厉的怜悯》中，当他谈论他如何成为基督徒时。首先，他谈到他意识到要成为基督徒，我必须相信耶稣基督，他不喜欢那样，因为他想要确定，而他没有得到，这是他说的。他说，我看到可能和已证明之间的差距。我如何跨越它？如果我要把我的整个生命押在复活的基督上，我想要证据，我想要确定性，我想要天空中的火字。

所以，他在退缩，但后来他说，他说的是，但后来我意识到，哦，我的天，我身后也有一个差距，是的，我必须跳跃，你知道，接受耶稣基督需要信仰的跳跃，因为我无法证明基督是神，但天哪，我也没有证据证明他不是。这是无法忍受的。

我不能在没有巨大信仰的情况下拒绝耶稣。一旦我意识到这一点，一旦我意识到我要跨越身后的差距需要信仰，我就把自己抛过了前面朝向耶稣的差距。现在，这是最后一件事，这是极其有趣和重要的。这个人扩大了他的视野，他不只是经历，他不只是思考。他扩大了对神的视野。

托马斯·库恩写了一本名为《科学革命的结构》的书，非常非常著名的书，他试图说的是，我们所有人都有范式，我们有关于生活的思考方式，当范式接收到一些它无法解释的数据时，我们就会产生怀疑。当它无法解释时，就会发生范式转变，这意味着你经历了怀疑，但然后你扩展范式，使它能够解释你无法理解的数据。例如，我见过小孩子这样，很小的孩子，通常在他们长大的过程中，他们信任成年人，因为他们生活中唯一的成年人是他们的父母，或者有一些人，也许是叔叔阿姨和他们的保姆之类的。他们期望所有成年人都自我控制，做这些事。在某个时候，小孩子会看到一个成年人做一些她百万年都没想过成年人会做的事情。

然后妈妈必须坐下来说，现在宝贝，我必须明白一件事，你的生活理论，你的人性范式太小了，我的意思是，你四岁。你不认为成年人会这样行事，但宝贝，成年人真的可以这样行事。所以发生的事情是她正在经历一个范式转变。她的生活理论太小了，无法处理现实。我想让你考虑这一点，当怀疑进入你的生活时，那是因为你对神的理解太小了，无法处理它。

克服它的方法不只是简单地回到你以前相信的方式，你必须对神有一个更广阔的视野，对神有一个更大的视野，这正是他在这里所做的。你知道它的核心在哪里吗？它在这里第21和22以及23节，对不起。当我心里发酸，肺腑被刺时，我这样愚昧无知，在你面前如畜类一般，然而我常与你同在。你搀着我的右手。

看这里，他改变了你对神的看法。当他谈论自己如同野兽时，我是一只野兽。让我给你讲两个小故事。伊丽莎白·艾略特，传教士和作家，曾经讲过一个故事，一个真实的故事，关于她如何拜访一些农民，一些牧羊人，基本上是威尔士北部高地的养羊农民。她发现每年一次他们必须抓住他们的羊，他们必须把它们浸在一桶杀虫剂里，否则昆虫会真的吃掉羊。

但这对羊来说很艰难，因为你必须抓住羊的四只脚，前腿和后腿，然后像这样浸它们，你知道，只是把它们浸没，让它们被淹没大约15秒钟之类的。我想让你知道，即使这正是羊需要的，没有一只喜欢它。只想让你知道这一点。当伊丽莎白·艾略特看着这个时，她在想自己是一只羊，主是我的牧者，她说，你知道吗，神经常对我们这样做。他给我们真正需要的东西，即使我们可能10年、20年、30年、40年都不知道，或者也许直到死后才知道。

看，这个人突然意识到的是，等一下，如果我真的相信神，一位创造世界的神，当然他能够做一些我无法理解的事情，我怎么敢认为所有事情都必须按照我认为的方式发生。然后他意识到我是羊，我就像动物，我不信任我的主人。另一个故事是几年前，我记得这个，我在一次野餐，我记得这个，一只小猫掉进了一条小溪，一条非常冷的小溪，肯定会淹死。一个男孩走进去把小猫拉了出来，救了它。但当他把小猫拉出来时，小猫当然很害怕，只是咬和抓他的手，它的救主的手，直到流血。

这个人说的是，我的心发酸，我的灵被刺，我愚昧无知，在你面前如畜类一般。然而我常与你同在，你搀着我的右手。他对神有了更大的视野，他让神大到足以做一些他无法理解的事情。他说，嗯，我的天，为什么我不能有一位大到我无法理解的神，他能做一些我无法理解的事情？所以他对神的视野变得更大，同时也更温柔，因为他说，你从未放弃过我。

你一直与我同在，你仍然搀着我的右手。尽管我有多愚蠢，尽管我咬你抓你，你继续爱我，对我忠诚。所以他对神的认识变得更大更温柔，结果，他可以处理他周围看到的生活。现在，这是我想问你的，这是如何发生的？他怎么能确定，尽管他对神如此野蛮，尽管他做了所有这些，他一直在质疑他，他一直这样对待神，他怎么能确定神仍然与他同在？

他怎么能确定神已经原谅了他？他怎么能确定神从未让他离开？现在，我不认为他能确定，除非他受圣灵启示写圣经的一部分。这是神的启示，他就是知道，但你和我怎么能知道呢？为什么神不会，当我们这样行事，我们确实这样行事时，为什么神不会只是说，嘿，自然后果，你走你的路？

我们怎么知道神没有让我们离开？他不会让我们离开。我告诉你怎么知道。我们没有神的启示，我们有，嗯，不是直接的，但我们有新约，这是我们看到的。当耶稣基督在十字架上时，他喊道，我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？

你知道他在说什么吗？我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？当他说他的父亲，我感觉不到你的手。看耶稣的一生，他与我们其他人完全不同。他从未对他的父亲野蛮。

他一直对他的父亲忠诚。他从未质疑他的父亲。他一直爱他的父亲。他是唯一应该让神搀着他的手的人，但在他生命的尽头，神让他离开了。他说，哦，我的神，我的神,为什么离弃我？

为什么？为了我们，耶稣基督得到了你我应得的。他失去了父亲的手，所以你和我可以知道，如果我们相信耶稣，我们因耶稣所做的而被神接纳，他永远不会让你离开。他永远不会离弃你。换句话说，我们对神的视野比这个人更大。

他不知道神会如此伟大，以至于来到地上，来到地上成为人。并上十字架为我们做这件事。我们对神有一个比他更大的视野和对神更有爱的视野。因此，我们应该更能够拥有一个处理生活的对神的广阔视野，我们应该比他更能够说他最后说的话，除你以外，在天上我有谁呢。除你以外，在地上我也没有所爱慕的。

我的肉体和我的心肠衰残，但神是我心里的力量，又是我的福分，直到永远。让我们祷告。我们的父，我们祈求你通过我们的怀疑使我们伟大。我们祈求你通过我们的怀疑把我们提升到新的层次。但我们祈求你帮助我们知道如何处理我们的怀疑，我们从这段经文，这段圣经中得到了一些相当好的指导。

但最重要的是，主啊，帮助我们看到，鉴于十字架，我们可以相信你不会放弃我们，你不会让我们离开，即使我们相当痛苦，即使我们在喊叫，即使我们在叫喊，即使我们充满怀疑。我们感谢你我们是因恩典得救的，不是通过我们的好行为，不是通过我们确定性的水平。我们感谢你我们是因恩典通过耶稣得救的，我们祈求你帮助我们因他所做的在恩典中成长。让这一切在我们的生命中成真和实现，我们奉耶稣的名祷告，阿门。

欢迎来到福音与生命！当谈到公开自己的信仰时，你感到多自在呢？本月在播客中，提姆·凯勒探讨圣经对于拥有公开信仰的教导。他向我们展示了在多元化社会中公开我们的信仰是什么样子，以一种能够创造文明、和平以及与我们的邻舍进行有意义对话的方式。经文选读来自诗篇第73章第1至3节以及第12至26节。

神实在恩待以色列那些清心的人，至于我，我的脚几乎失闪，我的脚险些滑跌。我见恶人和狂傲人享平安，就心怀不平。恶人就是这样，他们既是常享安逸，财宝便加增。我实在徒然洁净了我的心，徒然洗手表明无辜，因为我终日遭灾难，每早晨受惩治。

我若说，我要这样讲，这就是以奸诈待你的众子。我思索怎能明白这事，眼看实系为难，等我进了神的圣所，思想他们的结局。你实在把他们安在滑地，使他们掉在沉沦之中。他们转眼之间成了何等的荒凉，他们被惊恐灭尽了。人睡醒了怎样看梦，主啊，你醒了，也必照样轻看他们的影像。

因而我心里发酸，肺腑被刺，我这样愚昧无知，在你面前如畜类一般。然而我常与你同在，你搀着我的右手，你要以你的训言引导我，以后必接我到荣耀里。除你以外，在天上我有谁呢？除你以外，在地上我也没有所爱慕的。我的肉体和我的心肠衰残，但神是我心里的力量，又是我的福分，直到永远。这是神的话语。

那么，我们正在进行一个名为"公开的信仰，分享内心的盼望"的系列。我们生活在一个不鼓励人们公开自己的信仰、自己的宗教信念的西方社会中。我们被告知这是私人的事情，我们不应该谈论它，但讽刺的是，我们的文化实际上鼓励我们对其他所有事情都绝对开放和公开，其他所有事情，包括性，

因为这就是我们的本质。但没有什么比你的宗教信仰、比你最深层的信仰更能体现你是谁，因此我们作为一个社会面临的挑战是：我们如何能够诚实地面对自己是谁，这意味着我们如何能够公开我们的信仰，同时又以一种尊重并支持和平的方式来做到这一点。所以我们都必须学习这一点，而我们在这个系列中所做的事情之一就是讨论这个问题。

现在，如果我们要成为一个成熟的社会，能够谈论信仰，我们也必须能够知道如何谈论怀疑。在这方面，我们从宗教人士或世俗人士那里都得不到多少帮助。宗教人士倾向于把怀疑看作是一件非常糟糕的事情，一件可怕的事情，在许多宗教人士周围，表达怀疑感觉并不安全。但另一方面，许多世俗人士，特别是在像纽约市这样的地方，许多人相信永恒的怀疑、持续的怀疑、深刻的怀疑主义是唯一成熟且理智的立场。然而，圣经看待怀疑的方式既不像世俗人士那样积极，也不像宗教人士那样消极。

圣经并没有说怀疑像世俗人士说的那样积极，或者像宗教人士说的那样消极。因为实际上怀疑并不是那么简单化的，它不全是好的，也不全是坏的，只有当你开始以一种细致入微的方式看待它时，怀疑才能真正成为我们取得进步的途径。现在，为了理解圣经对此的看法，我们将看这首非常著名的诗篇，这段非常著名的经文。我们已经读了开头和结尾，为了节约起见，我们省略了中间的某些部分，我会提到那部分。这段经文非常丰富，它是一个人的案例研究，他的名字叫亚萨，这位诗篇作者，一个人经历怀疑的过程，他如何穿越那种怀疑实际上达到了更高层次的信仰，尽管这可能不完全相同，他的处境可能不完全与你的相同。

然而，圣经关于怀疑所说的基本原则，我实际上认为圣经对此的看法几乎是独特的。我不知道是否

在其他任何地方寻找，怀疑既不是那么好也不是那么坏，而是这种微妙的、多维度的东西，没有比这里更好的地方能找到这种圣经的观点了。所以让我们在这段经文中从三个标题来看怀疑。它是什么？什么导致了它？

什么能转化它？它是什么？什么导致了它？什么能转化它？那么它是什么？

用来形容怀疑的隐喻在第二节。对我来说的第二节，我的脚几乎滑倒，我几乎失去了立足点。现在这是一个很好的形象。当你失去立足点时，有那么一刻你失去了平衡，当你失去平衡时，你正在经历某种眩晕，一种迷失方向的感觉，你知道的，某种头晕。新约中有一个希腊词用来形容怀疑，die-psychos，意思是dipsychos，意思是两个psyches（心灵），基本上意味着精神上的复视。

如果你有复视，这意味着你的眼睛没有给你的大脑提供足够的信息来知道该把脚放在哪里。当你不太确定该把脚放在哪里时，就有一种不确定性，这就是怀疑。在属灵上，这是一种不确定性。你失去了你之前可能拥有的确定性，这就是怀疑。现在，从这里一开始的介绍中，我们立即就能学到关于怀疑的什么？

答案是，首先，我们了解到任何人都可能有怀疑。因为尽管我们对亚萨不太了解，我们不知道这个人的太多信息，这篇诗篇的作者，但他仍然是圣经的作者。这是一个相当高的属灵成就水平，你不觉得吗？这里有一个写圣经的人，受到神圣的默示。然而，这里有一个人，尽管他达到了这样的属灵水平，却充满了怀疑。

他说，我几乎失去了我的立足点，这意味着我几乎失去了我的信仰之握。所以任何人都可能有怀疑。但我们学到的另一件事，几乎立即，只是通过快速阅读，就是怀疑可以是一件积极的事情。这里你有的怀疑，到书的结尾，对不起，到诗篇的结尾，将会导致更高层次的信仰，以及一些最著名的

肯定的话语，我的肉体和我的心肠虽然衰残，但神是我心里的力量，又是我的福分，直到永远。换句话说，这里已经有进步了。

现在，信仰引导的想法，不好意思，是怀疑和质疑引导进步的想法，不应该那么奇怪。弗朗西斯·培根，几百年前最早的现代科学家之一，他是早期的现代科学家之一，在某个地方说过，他有点夸大其词，但他说得对。如果你从确定性开始，你将以怀疑结束。如果你从怀疑开始，你将以确定性结束。他真正想说的是，作为一名科学家，他说，如果你看看现在人们所接受的东西，如果你不质疑它，如果你只是接受别人告诉你的一切，你永远不会成长。

你永远不会成长到新的理解领域。如果你只是接受事物，不，不，科学方法是基于怀疑的。提出问题。保持怀疑。不要接受事物。

他想说的是，如果你从确定性开始，你实际上会发现你实际上学不到那么多，如果你从没有确定性开始，你学到的更多。所以这显然在任何探究领域都是如此。但在灵性上也是真实的。圣经中谈论怀疑最著名的地方是多疑的多马。多马是十二个门徒之一，在耶稣基督死后，他和门徒们有一次聚会，耶稣出现了。

复活的耶稣出现并显示他还活着。问题是多马错过了那次聚会。你知道，记得几年前我听到一位牧师说，在以赛亚书第六章，以赛亚上到圣殿，他看见主高高在上，他的衣裳垂下，遮满圣殿，有天使说，圣哉，圣哉，圣哉，以赛亚就仆倒在地，如同死了一样。我记得那位牧师说，当然，他去了教会，而他最没想到会在那里见到的人就是神。同样，多马也是对你的一个警告，永远不要错过教会。

你永远不知道。耶稣可能会出现。耶稣可能会出现而你错过了他。所以我承认，这通常不会发生，但有时确实会发生。现在，当多马听说耶稣已经

从死里复活了，所有的门徒都看见了他，多马却说，除非他向我显现，否则我不会相信。

而且我不仅要看见他，还要看见他手上的钉痕，我还要把手指放进钉痕里。耶稣做了什么呢？耶稣向多马显现了。值得注意的是，他并没有说，多马，你为什么质疑我？你知道，他说的第一句话是，好吧，你想看我的手。

你想看钉痕。它们在这里。把你的手指放进来。当然，多马以伟大的认信和肯定作为回应，这在某种程度上是约翰福音的高潮。他说，我的主，我的神，在约翰福音中，没有任何地方有人直接看着耶稣基督说，你是神。

换句话说，这个怀疑，这个怀疑的表达，把耶稣带进了多马的生命中，并引导多马达到了一个比他没有质疑时更高的信仰肯定。如果他没有提出问题，如果他没有怀疑。然而，耶稣并没有简单地，一方面，耶稣没有说，你怎么敢质疑我。他给了多马他所要求的。另一方面，他最后说，所以多马，停止怀疑，开始相信。

你看，这就是耶稣向我们展示的，圣经向我们展示的对怀疑的态度，这是宗教人士和世俗人士都没有的态度。它没有宗教人士说的那么糟糕，也没有世俗人士说的那么好。他说，看，不要默许你的怀疑。让怀疑驱使你走向别的东西，但与此同时，耶稣根本没有压制这些怀疑。所以对怀疑以及它带来的眩晕和失衡有一些重要的理解，但也可以是积极的。

其次，是什么导致了这个人的怀疑？现在他指出了两件事。首先，他说，我看见了某些东西，其次，他说，我经历了某些东西。他看见了什么？第1、2和3节简要地说明了这一点。

神是良善的。神善待那些内心纯洁的人。这是关于神的教义。这是传统的圣经神学教义。神是良善的神。

他关心内心纯洁的人。这并不意味着无罪。

这意指那些委身于神的人。所以他以好的神学作为开始。神是良善的神，他关怀那些内心纯洁的人。

但在第3节那里,经文说，我看见恶人兴旺。然后第4到11节，为了节省时间我们没有读到的经文，说了这样的事情。他正在观察恶人。这是什么意思呢？他们没有挣扎。

他们的身体健康强壮。这是第4到11节的内容。他们摆脱了人类共同的重担。他们不受人间疾病的困扰。他们用暴力、用傲慢包裹自己。

他们威胁压迫。他们说，神怎能知道？至高者有知识吗？现在，诗篇作者亚萨所说的是，在这个宇宙中，在这个世界上，在神的治理之下，据说在一位良善的神之下，那些抬举自己的人、那些操纵他人的人、那些剥削他人的人，正过着美好的生活。顺便说一句，这不仅仅发生在那时。

事实是，这个世界就是这样：骄傲的、自我抬举的、无情的、善于操纵的、自我中心的、剥削性的行为，能让你赚很多钱，能让你相当成功，能帮助你攀上权力的阶梯。所以他所说的，并不是什么我们从未见过的事情。而他为此感到困扰。他说，为什么一位良善的神，一位据说掌管这个世界的良善的神，会允许这种不公义，允许有权势的人压迫穷人和边缘化的人？这是第一件事。

但这不仅仅是一个智识上的问题。因为他不只是看见某些事，他亲身经历了某些事。第13、14、16节，他说，我实在是徒然洁净了我的心，徒然洗手表明无辜。我终日遭灾难，每早晨受惩治。现在，告诉我这听起来是不是很熟悉。

基本上，他在说，听着，我试图保持纯洁。我的理解是，神关怀内心纯洁的人。所以我试图保持我的心纯洁。我洗手表明无辜，但这似乎是徒然的。因为我终日遭灾难，每早晨受惩治。

我们不知道那些是什么，但重点是他的生活充满了如此多的坏事以至于

几乎每天他都感觉醒来就发现有新的事情出了问题。最后，他在第16节中说，当我试图理解这一切时，这让我深感困扰。换句话说，他不仅仅是遇到了一个智力上的问题，他正在经历一个个人的体验。而这个个人体验意味着他用头脑相信的那些事情，现在对他的心来说并不那么真实了，比如上帝的爱和良善。现在，这就是我们学到的。

让我们从这里跳出来，因为你可能会说，好吧，那不完全是我的问题。好的，小心点。不要在这些细节里迷失了。我们稍微跳出来一点，站得更高一些。我们看到的是，怀疑来自于理性和逻辑推理与个人经历的结合。

或者让我这样说，所有的信仰，以及所有的怀疑，我们所有的怀疑，以及我们所有的信仰信念，总是一个产物，不仅仅是思考和推理，而是思考和推理与逻辑和智力思想的结合，以及社会和个人经历的结合。怎么说呢？好吧，让我们谈谈这个。我们这样说是什么意思？首先，社会和个人经历，社会经历，有一整个社会学领域，你知道的，叫做知识社会学。

知识社会学本质上是这样说的，如果在很大程度上，我们认为我们是通过思考和推理来形成信念的，但在很大程度上，我们发现那些我们希望他们喜欢我们的人的信念最为可信。我能再说一遍吗？我正在把一整门知识社会学课程浓缩下来，你们中有些人为此花了几千美元，如果你们先来这里的话，你们本可以省下那笔钱，然后说，哦，我明白了，好的，就是这样。你倾向于发现那些你希望他们喜欢你的人的信念最为可信。我们有某些圈子想要成为其中的一部分，我们有某些社交场合想要被包括在内。

我们有一些人，我们认为，这些是我们的人，这些是我想被认同的那类人。而且出于某种奇怪的原因，那些人的信念对我们来说似乎就是比其他人的信念更可信。

人们的"为什么"，因为我们不仅仅是装在容器里的大脑。我们是社会性的生物，我们不仅仅是理性的生物。因此，我们与谁交往以及他们说什么，对我们认为什么是可信的和合理的有着巨大的影响。所以你的社会经历不仅与形成你的信念有很大关系，也与形成你的怀疑有很大关系，但还有个人经历，你看，我们的信念不仅仅是推理的产物，它们也是个人经历的产物。

你可能读了一本书，你可能上了一门课，人们在其中说，美国共和国的建国文件是完全正确的，人人生而平等。种族是平等的，个体是平等的，每个人都有平等的尊严。但如果你，如果你遇到了某个特定种族或国籍的两三个成员，而你从未遇到过该种族或国籍的其他任何人，而那些人对你很刻薄，他们对你很刻薄，他们对你很残忍，他们对你很残忍，这是你唯一见过的三个人，我想让你知道，无论书上说什么，你都会有一种发自内心的消极的个人感觉，觉得那些人有问题。你看，换句话说，你的种族态度和你的信念在很大程度上是由个人经历决定的，你看，这是不可避免的，因为我们不仅仅是理性的生物，我们不仅仅是机器人，我们不仅仅是计算机，我们既是社会性的存在，也是个人性的存在，同时也是理性的存在，因此你的信念以及你的怀疑来自思考和经历的结合，这意味着如果你处于怀疑中，如果你正在怀疑你曾经确信的东西，那是因为理性和个人经历的结合现在使这些信念对你的心来说变得不真实了。那么这有什么关系呢？

你说，嗯，这就是它的关系所在，这就是为什么我认为它很重要的原因。一方面，我希望你避免陷入两个相反的错误之一。一个错误是认为如果你对基督教产生了怀疑，这严格来说是一个智力问题。你看，这不是很讨人喜欢，不是吗？

承认我们在多大程度上受到社会塑造，经历在多大程度上塑造了我们，假设你在教会中长大，在基督教信仰中成长，然后你去了某个真正优秀的精英学术机构，你周围的每个人，你所有的朋友，所有你想融入的人，你所有的教授都在嘲笑传统的宗教信仰。

然后你拿起一本书，读了西格蒙德·弗洛伊德的《幻觉的未来》，然后说，哦，这让我确信基督教不是真的，真的是这样吗？拜托，不仅仅是这样，你知道的，事情不是这样运作的，没有人是这样运作的。你的社会环境让你觉得西格蒙德·弗洛伊德所说的相当可信。所以我不是说他没有好的论据，我只是想说，认识到这样一个事实：你不仅仅是，你的怀疑不仅仅是理智上的。它们也是个人性的，好吗？

但另一方面，不要认为你不能推理、不能思考，不要陷入另一个极端，就是说，好吧，我们所有的信念都只是我们文化的产物。你知道，你来自马达加斯加，你来自加拿大，你来自这里，你来自那里，你是这个种族，当然你会相信那个，因为我们所有的信念都是社会建构的，因此，你知道，没有，事情就是这样。彼得·伯格，一位知识社会学的先驱，几年前写了一本小书叫《天使的传闻》，在那本书里，他有一个很棒很棒的小章节叫做《相对化那些相对主义者》。在其中他说，在我的领域，已经通过实证证明人们在他们的信念上非常非常受到他们的文化和社会位置的塑造。他说，但在我的领域，有时人们常说，所有信念都是社会建构的，因此，你不能相信它。

每个人都只是他们文化的产物，每个人都只是他们社会环境的产物，所以你不能相信他们的信念，所有信念都是社会建构的。他说，这个陈述唯一的问题是这个陈述本身就是一个信念。如果

所有信念都是社会建构的且不可信，那么这个信念本身也是你社会处境的产物,它也不可能是真的。如果它不可能是真的,那么并非所有信念都是社会建构的。相对主义总是自我吞噬。

那么我们剩下什么呢?哦,他说,我们很好。我们剩下的是,我们应该对自己持谦卑、谨慎的看法。我们应该意识到在很大程度上我们并不客观,在很大程度上我们不喜欢跳出我们社会环境的框框来思考。然而我们必须这样做,因为彼得·伯格说,最终,你面对所有这些相互竞争的真理主张,我们不能说我们只是社会建构的,因此,我们无法不持有某种信念,因为那种信念也会是社会建构的。

因此,最终,我们仍然必须说这些信念中哪一个是真的。我们仍然必须思考。不要只是说,嗯,我只是有偏见。为什么?嗯,我遇到的那个种族的三个人都对我刻薄和残忍。

那么,想一想,你觉得也许在你的种族里可能也有三个残忍的人吗?你不认为有可能某人可能遇到你种族中的三个残忍的人,然后认为你们所有人都是那样吗?思考!所以一方面,你的怀疑不仅仅来自思考,但另一方面,你仍然必须思考。如果你要处理这些怀疑,好吧,那么他是如何处理这些怀疑的呢?

怀疑如何成为他不会困在其中的东西,而是本质上他用来将自己提升到一个全新水平的东西?什么改变了?三件事。这不应该完全让你惊讶,因为我们刚才谈到过。经验、思考和对神更宏大的认识。经验、思考和对神更宏大的认识,好的,首先,经验。

这将有点反直觉,但转折发生在哪里呢?你知道,第1到16节,他受压迫,我试图理解这一切,这让我深深困扰,然后第17节,直到——转折就在那里。事情开始在那里转变,发生了什么?这是他做的第一件事,直到我进入神的圣所。然后我明白了他们最终的命运。

现在，不要犯这个错误，不要以为他是说，好吧，他沿着路走着，看到我们纽约的那些宏伟美丽的大教堂之一，你注意到门开着，里面看起来很美，所以你就走进去，这是一个美丽的圣所，你坐下来,就只是思考一下。他说的不是这个地方。你知道为什么吗？因为唯一的圣所应该是圣殿。而在圣殿里发生的是什么呢？

敬拜。他去参加了一场敬拜聚会。他听到了神话语的歌唱，他听到了神的话语被宣讲，他听到人们歌唱，他被信徒们围绕着。你说，嗯，这是一件奇怪的事情要做，不，这不奇怪。原因如下。

这很公平，如果你承认，我不知道你怎么会做不到这一点，如果你承认你的怀疑并不是严格地通过思考产生的，那么你也不会严格地通过思考来度过你的怀疑。如果你的怀疑，在某种程度上，是因为你处在一些社交和个人的环境中，在那里神似乎不那么真实，那么公平起见，就应该平衡这个竞技场，去一些神似乎更真实的地方。去一个人们相信他的地方，去一个人们谈论他的地方，去一个有艺术的地方，去一个有教导的地方。换句话说，至少，要祷告。

你说，嗯，我不理解，我的意思是，如果你对神有怀疑，你怎么能向他祷告呢？

我不知道，有很多人对我有过怀疑，他们来找我谈论这件事，这帮助了我们的关系。你知道，我宁愿你不要坐在那里想，嗯，我觉得他是什么样的？我的意思是，我不知道，也许他是这样的，也许他是那样的，好吧，来问我吧。你知道，让我们谈谈这件事。同样地，为什么，为什么如果你是通过思考和经验的结合而偏离了信仰，你不应该通过不仅仅是思考，而是经验的结合来回到信仰或通过信仰呢？

他不只是离开去思考，他进入了圣所，所以这是第一件事。他愿意

他自己进入一个神看起来对他真实的经验性场所,这样他就可以清空思绪,因为他说,直到我进入神的圣所,然后我才明白他们的命运,这就引出了第二件事。第二件事是他确实进行了一些思考,而且是一些深刻的思考。这里面的内容比我能讲的更多,你知道,每次我讲这个,我都在想,也许我会讲得更久一点,多给你们一些内容。不,我真的不能,但我仍然想向你们展示他所做的两件事。

他思考这个问题的两种深刻方式。第一种是他愿意承认自己不好的动机。注意在一开始,他谈论他看到的所有这些不公正。你知道,为什么有权势的人压迫边缘化的人?但注意他说的话,即使在一开头,他也愿意坦诚。

他说,至于我,我的脚几乎滑跌,我差点失去立足之地,因为我嫉妒傲慢的人。这不是很有趣吗?他不是,他在这里说的是,这不仅仅是一个智力问题。我心怀怨恨,因为我觉得,我也想拥有那种权力。我也想拥有那种财富。

他在情感上非常投入,这就是为什么他说,等一下。我保持我的心纯洁,我洗净了我的双手,我应得他们所拥有的。他在这里愿意承认的是,再次说明,他不仅仅是有一个智力上的问题。这不是完全客观的,而是他的动机,他的动机也参与其中,或者这样说。你永远不会承认,不,除非你承认你发现很难相信X是真的,部分原因是因为你不希望X是真的。

看,除非你承认你发现很难相信X是真的的部分原因是因为你不希望它是真的,否则你永远不会真正正视这个信念的利弊。你永远不会真正做到智力上的诚实。托马斯·内格尔,他是纽约大学的一位哲学教授,非常杰出的哲学家,我出于很多原因对这个人极为尊敬。但几年前,他在一本叫《最后一句话》的书中写道,尽管他是一个无神论者,而且他

一个坚定的无神论者，他为此进行了非常雄辩的论证。然而，在这本书中，他写下了这样的话。

他说，我想谈谈对宗教的恐惧。我从经验出发，因为我自己也深受这种恐惧的影响。我希望无神论是真的。哦，这不仅仅是我不相信上帝，并且自然地希望我的信念是对的。而是我希望没有上帝。

我不想有上帝存在。我不想宇宙是那样的，然后他在一个小脚注中补充道。然而，我很好奇，是否有任何人对是否有上帝真正漠不关心。现在，他的意思是，这也是我所说的意思，这是一种如此的智识诚实。他说，他跟无神论者交谈，他们说，我之所以是无神论者，唯一的原因是我非常客观地审视了所有证据，然后我判断证据显示没有上帝。

他说，听着，在这件事上没有人是客观的。当然，你可以说，基督徒是那些想要相信来世的人。他们想要相信上帝。他们相信自己会与所爱的人永远在一起。但他在这里说的是，无神论者知道，如果有上帝存在，他们就不能按照自己想要的方式生活。

他说，我不想宇宙是那样的。我不想我的自由受到那种限制。因此他说，没有人是客观的，就像没有人是客观的。你有很多不想让上帝存在的理由。你也有一些想让祂存在的理由。

所以承认它。你看，这种智识上的诚实是至关重要的。承认你的动机。承认你并不是真的那么客观。承认它。

这并不意味着你可能不会仍然得出原来的结论，但你应该认识到这一点。所以首先，他审视了自己的动机，但第二件事是这样的。他开始认识到隐藏在所有怀疑中的深层信念。隐藏在所有怀疑中、嵌入其中的深层信念。看，我认为这是他看到的最深刻的东西。

这不是那么容易一下子就看到的，直到你把这些东西放在一起。注意他在一开始是怎么说的，在转变的一开始，不是在最一开始，而是他说，直到我进入

神的圣所，然后我明白了他们的最终结局。这里是关键，引用一下，这是他所看到的主要内容。你把他们放在滑溜的地方。现在，记住这里的比喻吗？

这是一个比喻。你的脚在滑动，你的脚在打滑。他已经用过这个比喻了。这是什么的比喻呢？你的脚所在的地方就是你信仰所在的地方。

你信仰的对象。因此，当你的脚打滑时，意味着你在努力保持你的信仰。现在，他转过身来，他说，不，等一下，等一下。他们的脚也在某个地方。他们也有信仰。

而他们信仰所在的地方比我信仰所在的地方更加不稳固。这是什么意思呢？好吧，别忘了。记得吗，我已经给你们读过一次了，是第11节。没有读出来，没有打印出来。

但在第11节中，在描述这些人，这些压迫者时，他们说，神怎么会知道呢？至高者有知识吗？看，这些生活非常自私的人，他们很残酷，他们剥削他人，他们这样做是基于对神的一种看法。他们说，神怎么会知道呢？至高者有知识吗？

这意味着什么呢，他们假设要么没有神，要么有一位神但不会审判我。换句话说，他们假设要么神不存在，要么神不在乎。要么没有神，要么是某种泛神论的力场式的神，不会因为我如何生活而审判我。那么，他们的生活是基于一种对神的看法，而这种看法他们无法证明。如果你的生活，如果你在生活方式中假设一种你无法证明的对神的看法，那是什么？

那是信心。那就是信心。看，也许你无法证明神的存在，但你也无法证明神不存在。你无法证明没有一位会审判你的神。因此，当你的生活就好像那位神不存在一样，那是一种信心的行为。

你在拿你的永恒命运打赌，赌神要么不存在，要么不是一位在乎的神。布莱士·帕斯卡，他著名的帕斯卡赌注就谈到了这一点。如果你听说过帕斯卡赌注，如果你听说过或者如果你听过

它被呈现的方式，你可能听到的都是最糟糕的呈现方式。我从未听到过真正有力的呈现方式，除非你自己阅读并思考它。帕斯卡想要表达的是这样的：当然，如果你相信上帝，这是一种信心的跨越。

但如果你不相信上帝，或者你的生活就好像上帝不存在一样，那同样也是一种信心的跨越。那是一个巨大的信心跨越。无论你如何生活，你的生活都基于一种你无法证明的对上帝的看法，因此每个人都在凭信心生活。不仅如此，为什么在这里的结尾，他说：除你以外，在天上我有谁呢？除你以外，地上我也没有所爱慕的。

我的肉体和我的心肠衰残，但上帝是我心里的力量，又是我的福分，直到永远。他为什么这样说？他说的是，福分是你的产业，福分是你的，是你的财富，是你的保障。当他说上帝是我的福分时，他是在把他的福分和他们的福分进行比较。你看，如果上帝是你的福分，如果上帝是你为之而活的对象，如果上帝的爱是你为之而活的，没有人能从你那里夺走这个。

但如果财富是你为之而活的，如果权力是你为之而活的，就像那些他曾如此羡慕的人一样，那可以在一瞬间被夺走。他们把信心放在权力、金钱、成就、名声，或者别的什么东西上。他们把信心，把脚，把灵魂安放在某样可以永远被夺走的东西上，就那么快。因此他说，等一等，等一等。我这里充满了怀疑，但我意识到另一种选择——记住，他羡慕他们，这意味着他实际上在思考像他们那样生活会是什么样子。

他突然意识到，要让我像他们那样生活，意味着我必须把信心放在没有上帝这个我无法证明的观点上。而且我必须把我的灵魂安放在这些东西上，它们会永远被夺走，等一等。他们处在一个比我更滑溜的地方。他们的信心根基更不牢固，而且他们也在凭信心生活。所以他看到了，在内心深处

在他的怀疑中，在他怀疑的核心，他开始说，也许我会像这些人一样生活，而不是按照我一直以来的方式生活，但那需要信心。

那需要巨大的信心。他说，不，不，不，不，我拥有的信心更好。你明白他在做什么吗？这就是为什么谢尔登·范诺肯在他的《严厉的怜悯》一书中，当他谈论自己如何成为基督徒时，首先，他谈到了这样一个事实：他意识到要成为一名基督徒，我必须相信耶稣基督，他不喜欢这样，因为他想要确定性，但他没有得到，这就是他所说的。

他说，我看到了可能与被证明之间的鸿沟。我该如何跨越它？如果我要把整个生命押在复活的基督身上，我想要证据，我想要确定性，我想要天空中燃烧的字母。所以，他在退缩，但后来他说，这是他说的话，但后来我意识到，哦，我的天哪，在我身后也有一道鸿沟，是的，我必须跳跃，你知道，接受耶稣基督需要信心的跳跃，因为我无法证明基督是神，但天哪，我也没有证据证明他不是。这是无法忍受的。

我无法在没有巨大信心的情况下拒绝耶稣。一旦我意识到这一点，一旦我意识到要跳过我身后的鸿沟需要信心，我就把自己投向了我面前的鸿沟，奔向耶稣。现在，这是最后一件事，这是极其有趣和重要的。这个人扩展了他的视野，他不只是经历，他不只是思考。他扩展了他对神的看法。

托马斯·库恩写了一本名为《科学革命的结构》的书，非常非常著名的书，他试图说的是，我们所有人都有范式，我们有关于生活的思维方式，当范式接收到一些它无法解释的数据时，我们就会产生怀疑。当它无法解释时，就会发生范式转变，这意味着你经历了出来，但然后你扩展了范式，使它能够解释你无法理解的数据。例如，我曾经在小孩子身上看到过这种情况，非常小的孩子，通常在他们成长的过程中，他们信任成年人，因为他们接触到的唯一成年人

在他们的生活中是他们的父母，或者有一些人，也许是阿姨、叔叔和他们的保姆之类的。他们期望所有的成年人都能自我控制，做到这一点。在某个时刻，小孩子会看到一个成年人做一些她从来没有想到过的事情，成年人居然会做这种事。

然后妈妈不得不坐下来说，现在，亲爱的，我必须让你明白一件事，你的人生理论，你对人性的范式太小了，我的意思是，你才四岁。你没有想到成年人会这样做，但是，亲爱的，成年人真的会这样做。所以正在发生的事情是，她正在经历一个范式转变。她的人生理论太小了，无法处理这个现实。我希望你考虑这一点，当疑惑进入你的生活时，那是因为你对上帝的理解太小，无法处理它。

克服它的方法不仅仅是简单地回到你之前相信的方式，你必须对上帝有一个更广阔的视角，一个更大的视角，这正是他在这里所做的。你知道它的核心在哪里吗？就在这里，第21节、22节和23节，抱歉，更正一下。当我的心悲伤，我的灵痛苦时，我是愚昧无知的，我在你面前如同畜类一样，然而我常与你同在。你搀着我的右手。

看这里，他改变了你对上帝的看法。当他谈到自己像畜类时，我像野兽一样。让我给你讲两个小故事。伊丽莎白·艾略特，传教士和作家，曾经讲过一个真实的故事，关于她如何拜访一些农民，一些牧羊人，基本上是北威尔士高地的牧羊农场主。她发现，每年有一次，他们必须把羊带去，浸泡在一大桶杀虫剂里，否则昆虫会真的把羊吃掉。

但这对羊来说非常艰难，因为你必须抓住羊的四只脚，这里的前腿和后腿，像这样把它们浸下去，你知道，就是让它们完全浸没大约15秒钟左右。我想让你知道，即使这正是羊所需要的，它们没有一只喜欢这样。只是想让你知道这一点。当伊丽莎白

埃利奥特看着这段话，她把自己想象成一只羊，而主是我的牧者，她说，你知道吗，上帝经常对我们这样做。祂给我们真正需要的东西，尽管我们可能在10年、20年、30年、40年之后才知道，或者可能要等到死后才明白。

你看，这个人突然意识到，等一下，如果我真的相信上帝，一个创造世界的上帝，祂当然能够做我无法理解的事情，我怎么敢认为所有事情都必须按照我所想的方式发生呢。然后他意识到，我就是那只羊，我就像那个动物，而我没有信任我的主人。另一个故事是，多年前，我在一次野餐上，我记得这件事，有一只小猫掉进了一条溪流，一条非常冰冷的溪流，肯定会淹死。一个男孩走进去把小猫拉了出来，救了它。但当他把小猫拉出来时，小猫当然非常害怕，就一直咬和抓他的手，抓咬它救命恩人的手，直到流血。

这个人说的是，我心里忧伤，我的灵魂痛苦，我愚昧无知，我在你面前如同野兽一般。然而我却常与你同在，你牵着我的右手。他对上帝有了更大的认识，他让上帝足够伟大，可以做他无法理解的事情。他说，哎呀，我为什么不能拥有一个比我更伟大的上帝，一个能做我无法理解之事的上帝呢？所以他对上帝的认识变得更加宏大，同时也更加温柔，因为他说，你从未放弃过我。

你一直与我同在，你仍然牵着我的右手。尽管我是如此愚蠢，尽管我如何咬你、抓你，你却继续爱我，对我忠诚。所以当他对上帝的认识变得更宏大、更温柔时，结果是，他能够应对他周围看到的生活了。现在，我想问你的是，这是怎么发生的呢？他怎么能确定，尽管他对上帝如此粗暴，尽管他一直在做这一切，他一直在质疑祂，他一直在对待上帝像

这样，他怎么能确信神仍然与他同在？

他怎么能确信神已经赦免了他？他怎么能确信神从未放手离开他？现在，我认为他无法确信，除非他是受圣灵感动来写圣经的一部分。这是神的启示，他就是知道，但你和我怎么能知道呢？为什么神不会在我们这样行事时——而我们确实这样行事——为什么神不会直接说，嘿，自然后果，就走你自己的路吧？

我们怎么知道神没有放弃我们？他不会放弃我们。我来告诉你怎么知道。我们没有神的直接启示，我们有，嗯，不是直接的，但我们有新约圣经，这就是我们所看到的。当耶稣基督在十字架上时，他呼喊道，我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？

你知道他在说什么吗？我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？当他说这话时，他是在说父啊，我感受不到你的手。看耶稣的一生，他与我们其他人完全不同。他从未对父亲像野兽般粗暴。

他始终对父亲忠诚。他从不质疑父亲。他始终爱着父亲。他是唯一配得神牵着他的手的人，但在他生命的尽头，神放开了他。他说，哦，我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？

为什么？为了我们，耶稣基督承受了你我应得的。他失去了父的手，这样你我就能知道，如果我们相信耶稣，并且因着耶稣所成就的被神接纳，他永远不会放开你。他永远不会离弃你。换句话说，我们对神的认识甚至比这个人更大。

他根本不知道神会如此伟大，以至于来到地上，来到地上成为一个人。然后走上十字架，为我们做这一切。我们对神的认识比他更大，对神的爱的认识也比他更深。因此，我们应该更能拥有一个宏大的神观来应对生活，比他更应该能说出他在结尾所说的话，在天上我有谁呢？除你以外，在地上我也没有所爱慕的。

我的肉体和我的心肠衰残，但神是我心里的力量，又是我的福分，直到永远。让我们祷告。

我们的父，我们祈求你通过我们的疑惑使我们变得伟大。我们祈求你通过我们的疑惑将我们提升到新的层次。但我们祈求你帮助我们知道如何处理我们的疑惑，我们已经从这段经文中得到了一些很好的指导。

但最重要的是，主啊，帮助我们看到，因着十字架，我们可以相信你不会放弃我们，你不会离开我们，即使我们很痛苦，即使我们在哭泣，即使我们在呼喊，即使我们充满疑惑。我们感谢你，我们是因着恩典得救，不是通过我们的善行，不是通过我们的确信程度。我们感谢你，我们是因着恩典通过耶稣得救，我们祈求你帮助我们因他所做的而在恩典中成长。愿这一切在我们的生命中成真并实现，我们奉耶稣的名祷告，阿门。
