### Introduction: Thanksgiving and God's Provision

Hi, I'm Kathy Keller. Each year when we get to Thanksgiving, we pause to recognize all the ways God has been so gracious in His provision, both for our basic physical needs and for the ways that He provides for us spiritually to give us joy, hope, and renewal through His Son Jesus Christ.

### The Importance of Focusing on God

Thanksgiving has the potential to become broke or generic if we don't put our focus on God and His goodness. I want to encourage you to use the day as an opportunity to meditate on His word and the direction it gives us to see God and all He is. **Our strength and shield, our helper, our refuge, our Savior and friend.**

And I know I'm going to be just as much as you are up to my ears and stuffing and mashed potatoes and guests and everything, but just go lock yourself in the bathroom for five minutes for heaven's sakes and be thankful or something.

### Psalm 28:6-7 Reflection

Listen to these words from Psalm 28 verses 6 and 7. 

> Blessed be the Lord for He has heard the voice of my pleas for mercy. The Lord is my strength and my shield in Him my heart trusts and I am helped and my heart exalts and with my song I give thanks to Him.

These verses are a powerful reminder of all we have because Jesus loved us so much that He gave His life for us.

### Gratitude for Gospel and Life's Impact

I encourage you to think of all the ways God provides for you and I trust that God's spirit will generate joy, praise, and thanksgiving that comes from focusing on His amazing love. Please join us as we give thanks for all God is doing and for all He's done through gospel and life this past year.

We're so grateful for the encouragement we get from the messages we receive telling us how God is bringing people to trust God through you and through this ministry. So it's not merely a throwaway kind of statement when I say we have so much to be thankful for this year. We really do.

And I want to note just a few things our team here at gospel and life gives thanks for in 2025. For the more than 214,000 people who receive our quarterly journal and emails. For the millions of people who've listened to our podcast around the world. For the thousands of people who shared one of our resources with someone. And for the 284,000 downloads of the questioning Christianity podcast by people exploring or sharing the gospel.

### Closing: Thanksgiving and Partnership

On behalf of everyone here at gospel and life we also give thanks to God for you. For your prayers, your gifts, and how you're missionally sharing our content with those in your life. Thank you for your partnership as together we endeavor to reach others with a message of Christ's love. **Thanks be to God. He's changed everything through Christ.** Have a joyful Thanksgiving.

### 引言：感恩节与上帝的供应

大家好，我是凯西·凯勒。每年当我们迎来感恩节时，我们都会停下来，承认上帝在各个方面的恩典，无论是对我们基本物质需求的供应，还是通过祂的儿子耶稣基督在精神上给予我们的喜乐、希望和更新。

### 专注于上帝的重要性

如果我们不专注于上帝和祂的良善，感恩节可能会变得空洞或泛泛。我想鼓励你利用这一天作为一个机会来默想祂的话语，以及它给我们提供的方向，让我们看到上帝和祂的一切。**我们的力量和盾牌，我们的帮助者，我们的避难所，我们的救主和朋友。**

我知道我和你一样会被填料、土豆泥、客人和一切事情淹没，但请务必抽出五分钟的时间，哪怕是锁在浴室里，感恩或做点什么。

### 诗篇 28:6-7 的反思

听听诗篇 28 章 6 至 7 节的这些话。

> 耶和华是应当称颂的，因为祂听了我恳求的声音。耶和华是我的力量，是我的盾牌，我心里倚靠祂就得帮助，所以我心中欢乐，我必用诗歌称谢祂。

这些经文强有力地提醒我们，我们拥有的一切都是因为耶稣如此爱我们，以至于祂为我们舍命。

### 对福音与生命影响的感恩

我鼓励你思考上帝为你提供的一切方式，我相信上帝的灵会产生喜乐、赞美和感恩，这些都来自于专注于祂的奇妙爱。请加入我们，感谢上帝在过去一年中通过福音与生命所做的一切。

我们非常感谢收到的信息中告诉我们上帝如何通过你和这个事工使人们信靠上帝的鼓励。因此，当我说我们今年有太多值得感恩的事情时，这绝不是一句随便的话。我们真的有。

我想指出我们在 2025 年福音与生命团队感恩的几件事。超过 214,000 人收到我们的季刊和电子邮件。数以百万计的人在世界各地收听了我们的播客。成千上万的人与他人分享了我们的一项资源。以及 284,000 次对质疑基督教播客的下载，这些人正在探索或分享福音。

### 结尾：感恩与合作

代表福音与生命的每一个人，我们也感谢上帝赐予你。感谢你的祷告、你的礼物，以及你如何在生活中传递我们的内容。感谢你的合作，因为我们共同努力将基督的爱的信息传递给他人。**感谢上帝。祂通过基督改变了一切。** 祝你有一个快乐的感恩节。
