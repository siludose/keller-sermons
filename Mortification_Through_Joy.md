Welcome to Gospel in Life.  Are you longing to see real change in your life, in your habits, your relationships,  your heart?  Today, Tim Keller explores how lasting change actually happens in the life of a Christian  and why the Gospel offers a radically different process of transformation than anything  else.  The Scripture reading tonight is found on page 9 of the bulletin and it's Romans 8, 1-13.  There's therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.  For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin  and death.  For God has done what the law weakened by the flesh could not do.  By sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemns sin in the  flesh in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who  walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.  For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh,  but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.  To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and  peace.  For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law,  indeed it cannot.  Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.  You however are not in the flesh but in the Spirit.  If in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you, anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ  does not belong to him.  But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life  because of righteousness.  If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ  Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells  in you.  So then, brothers, we are deaders, not to the flesh to live according to the flesh.  For if you live according to the flesh, you will die.  But if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live.  This is God's Word.  I think I've said every week that when I first embraced the Christian faith, there was  a number of things in my life that profoundly needed changing, but nothing seemed to work  until some writers, some Christian writers, took me to Romans 6, 7 and 8, and when I began  to understand the teaching of Romans 6, 7 and 8, my life began to change.  And so in this brief series, I'm taking you to Romans 6, 7 and 8.  And the question is, how does Christ, how does faith in Christ actually lead to real  change in one's life?  Today we get to Romans 8 and we see that in Jesus we get three things, quite relevant for  the subject, three things we get.  We get a new freedom to know ourselves, let me put it in the second person.  We get a new freedom, you get a new freedom to know yourself.  You get a new method to change yourself, and you get a new power to be yourself.  You get a new freedom to know, method to change, power to be yourself, point one.  New freedom to know yourself, Romans 7, which we looked at last week, right up to verse  1, that is Romans 8, verse 1, right up to verse 22, 23, 24 of the end of chapter 7, is  saying this, that in every one of us, there is a dark mass, even the best of us, even the  St. Paul's, there's a dark mass of self-absorption, self-concentration, self-centeredness.  And as far worse than any of us want to admit, and it makes us capable of terrible sin  and evil.  And then immediately after saying that, is Paul saying this is true of you, it's true  of me, it's true of all of us, the moment he says that, he turns then to verse 1 of chapter  8.  And he says simultaneously, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.  And no condemnation, the word condemnation is Greek word, kata, kreena, which means to  have a judgment against, to be condemned or to be guilty means there's something against  you that there is, that you're liable for something and you're in a state of astrangement  until you pay your debt, let's say to society.  But this is saying that though we not only are capable of wrongdoing, but we're doing  wrong at the same moment with regard to God, nothing we have ever done brings us into  condemnation.  With regard to God, there is no liability.  And this word no, therefore now no condemnation.  That word no is too strong a word to convey with any one particular English word because  it's not a word that means there's now for the moment no condemnation.  This word no means, there's no more condemnation for Christians, no longer exists.  It's been destroyed, never again, that's what it's saying.  So Romans 7 is just saying we are capable of tremendous evil and immediately says at  the same time simultaneously, if you're in Christ, none of that can ever bring you into condemnation  with regard to God.  Now this is astounding and it's unique.  There's a place in Luke 11 where Jesus is speaking to his disciples and he's actually  teaching them about prayer and he says this, Luke 11, he says to his disciples, if you then  though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more you're  Heavenly Father, you who are evil, no, think about this.  He's talking to the people he loves, that he delights in, that he's going to die for,  that he's unconditionally committed to, but he's also saying, well, can you hear Jesus  saying this to you?  I love you.  I will never forsake you.  I'm unconditionally committed to you.  I delight in you, but you're evil, you know?  Have you heard that?  Because if you have, you have something that no, from what I can tell, no system of thought,  no philosophy, no religion, east, west, individualistic, collectivistic, liberal, conservative can  give you.  You know, there's a liberal, a liberal mindset that never calls anyone sinful or evil including  yourself because you see all problems are really functions of psychological or sociological  dynamics and when you really do something, far more cruel or cowardly or worse than anything  you ever thought you were capable of, you've got no category for it, you'll go into denial.  But there's a conservative mindset and there's a conservative mindset who does use the  term sinful and evil for people over there and whose very identity is based on the idea  that I'm not one of them.  I'm one of the virtuous people.  I'm not like those relativists, those anarchists, I'm one of the virtuous people.  And when you find yourself, and you will, doing things worse, more cruel, more cowardly  than anything you've ever done, you won't have a category for it, you won't know how  to deal with it, you will go into denial.  But the gospel of Jesus, Jesus attitude, Jesus statement, if you're in Christ, you are  simultaneously evil and absolutely loved, gives us a freedom, when you say, well, that's  crazy, that's contradictory, yeah, yeah, it's crazy, admittedly, it's really weird.  But let me show you how great it is.  Because first of all, it gives you an unmatched, unique, sociological freedom.  What I mean by that is, you don't have to divide, you can't, if you understand this, divide  the world anymore into the good guys, the bad guys.  Some people say there's the good people, then there's the liberals.  Some say there's the good people, then there's the fundamentalists.  Everybody's saying there's a good bad, but if you're a Christian, if you have any understanding  of this, you know, you know that the difference between you and a prostitute, you and a murderer,  you and a Nazi.  The only difference between you and them is that the seeds in your heart that make you  capable of being or doing that just never got watered, so they never sprouted.  And therefore you have the freedom, in Christ we have the freedom, to find common humanity  with people, anybody, we sense our common fragile humanity, we don't write people off, and  we don't call the people, those people, the other with capital O, but it's also even  more importantly, the gospel gives you psychological freedom, to handle things that you are going  to do, and then you won't have to deny or spin them or repress them and make it impossible  for you to know who you are, because I don't believe there's any other, only with that support  of saying, look, you're capable of terrible things, and I'm absolutely unconditionally committed  to you since Jesus.  If you've got that kind of support, will you really be able to be honest?  Oh, you say, this idea of calling yourself a sinner, that's emotionally unhealthy, you  say, oh no, oh no, it's emotionally unhealthy not to be able to call yourself a sinner.  Can I give you an example?  One true account that has really affected Kathy and my understanding of this is that years  ago, when we were in Virginia, in our area, these aren't people we knew personally, in  our area, a terrible thing happened in the late 70s, to a young married couple.  They had three children, they were strapped into an automobile, the automobile ended up going  in without any drivers in it.  The automobile went into a lake or a pond, and all three children were killed.  They're all drowned, horrible tragedy.  But at the funeral, the husband and wife, to everyone's surprise, really testified to  their faith in God, and they seemed to be so incredibly spiritually strong, that everyone  for miles around, were just talking about what incredibly faithful, good Christian people  they are, what faith in God, and they did.  They picked themselves up, and they had more children, and they built a new family, and  they, of course, were pillars in the church, and the husband was an officer in the church,  he was a pillar in the church, 20 years later, we were in another church, and we heard  a minister tell a story about a man, and even though he rightly so did not use the man's  name, it was very, very clear, it was very obvious to us, this is the same guy, the father.  And he talked about the fact that this man had gone through incredible trouble, losing  all three children, and he was a pillar of this community, and a pillar of his church,  but they had come to the pastor, many years later, in absolute agony, because he had discovered,  he had found that he was very strongly sexually attracted to a woman in the church that  wasn't his wife, and he had very strong feelings, and a very strong attraction, and he  was struggling, and he was an agony, and he was, he experienced horrible guilt, he, the  pillar of the church, an officer in the church, how could he feel this way, how could he  do this, how could he want this?  And the pastor said this story was that he got a lot of counseling, he got good counseling,  got professional counseling, he got spiritual counseling, but in the end, he killed himself.  Now, is that just a sad story?  Oh, yes, of course it's a sad story, but listen to me.  Here's a man who could handle the worst suffering that the world could give to him, but couldn't  handle the possibility that he was a sinner.  And are you going to tell me it's emotionally unhealthy to be able to call yourself a sinner?  For him, it was the absolute opposite of emotional disc health, unhealthy.  To be able to say, I am capable of terrible things, but I'm unconditionally loved, is  the epitome of mental health.  And it's the gospel that gives us that.  The gospel gives you freedom to admit who you are when the information comes.  To see where you do need to change, the freedom to know yourself, point one, point two.  The second thing we learn here is the gospel gives you a new method for change, a method.  Up in verse three, there's another reiteration of one of the themes of Romans seven.  It says, for God has done what the law weakened by the flesh could not do.  And remember, we talked about this last week, one of the points that Paul makes in Romans seven  is that we've got all this self-centeredness and this self-absorption and this self-concentration.  We've got this mass in us that's making our own lives miserable with this self-concentration.  It makes our lives miserable people around us.  What are we going to do about it?  And what we usually do is we apply willpower and we see the moral law and we say we're  going to live up to the moral law.  And Paul is pointing out here he's summarizing what he said in Romans seven that that doesn't  help you because you know self-centeredness and self-righteousness can take a moral form  as well as an immoral form.  You can be a Pharisee as well as a criminal and still make the world a mess of a place.  So what are we supposed to do in order to change ourselves?  The answer is verse 13, here it is, for if you live according to the flesh, you will  die, but if by the Spirit you put the death, the deeds of the body you will live.  If by the Spirit you put the death, the deeds of the body you will live.  Now in Romans six and Romans seven, and I'm afraid to prove this exegetically, you'd have  to go back to the sermons, I can't recapitulate here, but in Romans six and seven we learn that  when Paul talks about the flesh, he's not talking about the physical body.  When Paul talks about the deeds of the body or the deeds of the flesh, he's talking about  the whole life being controlled by a self-salvation project, that what Paul means by living in the  flesh means to be your own Savior, to be your own Lord, to try to instead of letting  God be your Savior and Lord, and everything in your life, everything that your body  does, everything your whole life does, everything in your life, all your actions and attitudes  and everything is controlled by an effort to be your own Savior and Lord.  It's a self-salvation project, that's what it means to live according to the flesh and  live in the flesh.  And what he's saying in verse 13 is fascinating.  He says, if you live according to the flesh, you will die, but if you root out and destroy  your particular ways of trying to save yourself, if you root out and destroy your  particular ways of doing self-salvation, you will live.  If you just go with the flow, you will die.  If you live according to self-salvation project, you will die.  But if you root out and identify and destroy your particular ways of doing self-salvation,  then and only then will you live, will you say, how does that work?  What is this new method?  At the heart of the new method, verse five and six says, is recognizing and changing  what you mind.  It hasn't changed what you put your mind on.  Look at verse four and five.  It's just another statement of verse 13.  He says, for those who live according to the flesh, see, set their minds on the things  of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things, the  Spirit.  To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life, wow,  and peace.  Now if you must keep this in mind, unpack this.  First of all, in the Bible, mind and heart are not two different things.  Yes, in English, in our way of thinking, mind means the reason and the cognition and  heart means the emotions, but not in the Bible.  Mind and the heart are the core of the being.  And therefore, when Paul says, you set your mind on the flesh, he's not just saying,  you have bad thoughts.  And he's not even talking only about thoughts.  Here's what he's saying.  He's asking you to look at yourself and recognize what preoccupies you.  What engrosses you the most.  What is your heart most engrossed in?  Where are your dreams?  Where do they reside?  What has captured your imagination?  What most preoccupies and engrosses, the very core of your thinking and your dreaming  and your fantasizing and your heart and your mind because, Paul says, whatever that is,  is always your way of justifying yourself, your way of proving yourself, your way of developing  your own sense of value and worth, and therefore, that's your way of being your own Savior  and Lord.  You say, would you please flesh that out, yes.  The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God, even Jesus relied on the Psalms  to face every situation, including death.  In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365-day devotional, the songs of Jesus, you'll find daily readings  through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight.  If you don't have a regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start, and if  you already spend time and study and prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms  can help you bring your deepest emotions and questions before God and discover a new  level of intimacy with Him.  We'll send you Tim and Kathy Keller's devotional as our thanks for your gift to help Gospel  and Life share the love of Jesus with more people.  I've just recently realized, I mean, I just found to my fascination, that when the movie  Chariots of Fire in 1981 was made, a true story of two British men, Harold Abrams and  Eric Little, who won gold medals for Britain in the 1924 Paris Olympics.  I didn't realize that when that film came out in 1981, Jenny Little, Eric Little's sister  was still alive.  Eric Little went on to be a missionary in China and died in a detention camp in China during  World War II.  But Jenny, who's also depicted in the movie, lived through to the place where she had  an interview after the movie came out, and one of the things that she said was one thing  that bothered her a little bit about the movie was there's only one scene in which is  the glimpse of this, and if you know the movie, you know which one it is.  But she says the thing the movie didn't show is that every time, whenever Eric, her brother,  who was a world-class runner, sprinter, a hundred-yard dash, and so on, whenever Eric ran,  he always ran with his face straight up to the sky and his mouth wide open, looking like  a crazy man.  He always ran with his face smack up to the sky, facing directly with his mouth open.  He looked crazy, he looked eccentric, but he was worshipping.  Because Harold Abrams and Eric Little were both setting their mind on the same thing.  They wanted to run, they wanted to win, and they wanted to run and win a race.  But for totally different reasons.  Because when Harold Abrams is asked, why are you running?  He describes the hundred-yard dash and he says, when that gun goes off, I've got ten seconds,  he says, quote unquote, to justify my existence.  And what he's saying is, only if I can win this race, if I can be an accomplished athlete,  and I know I matter, then I can face the world because I've accomplished this thing.  But of course, Eric Little in the movie says to Jenny, Jenny, God made me fast.  And when I run, I feel his pleasure.  Now listen, here's one guy and he's running to praise his Savior, and here's the other  guy who's running to become his own Savior.  They said so.  Here's one guy who is running for the sheer joy of it.  It's icing on the cake.  If he wins great, if he doesn't win great, because he's already justified.  His life is justified.  Here's the other guy who's running in grinding anxiety, churning and grinding down, anxiety  and fear, because he's seeking to be justified.  He said so.  And by the way, as you know, in the movie, even after he wins, he finds it unsatisfying  because idols never deliver.  Now you begin to understand, to set the mind on the flesh is not just having bad thoughts.  It's essentially to put your mind and your heart on something besides Jesus Christ as  functional Savior.  And to see how that actually works, let me just give you another kind of example.  I remember some years ago, many years ago, counseling two young men at the same time.  Both of them had just lost their jobs because their bosses had been pretty stupid and wrong  and unfair.  Because of an unfair action, the part of their bosses, they both lost their job and they  both had a blot on their career record.  But Guy A, pretty much got over it, forgave the boss, moved on, and sin was doing so well  that he more than compensated for that little blot, it essentially was a non-issue.  The other guy couldn't get past it.  He stayed very bitter, stayed incredibly cynical, and it was affecting his career, it was affecting  his job, it was affecting his whole future career path.  I've ever sit down with that second guy and a lot of people have been trying to help him.  And some people try to work directly on his emotions and the way you work directly on  the emotions is you say, oh, you know, you're sympathy and you're talking about how hard  it's been and how awful it's been and you're trying to help the person and the problem  is the more sympathy that people showed him, the more he felt justified in how angry  he was and the more his self-pity grew and grew and he got worse.  Other people try to work right on his will.  They said, come on, buck up, don't let the bastards get you down, just forgive it, get  past it, didn't help either.  Because the gospel, however, is different.  For the gospel doesn't work directly on the emotions and say, oh, you know, God loves  you in some general way, though he does.  And the gospel doesn't direct directly on the will and say, now, you have to do the  right thing.  Of course, you do have to do the right thing.  But the gospel says, what is functioning in the place of Jesus Christ as your real functional  salvation and savior?  What are you looking to to justify yourself and see what happened was the one guy cared  about his career and the other guy cared about his career.  But the second guy was looking at his career, the way Harold Abrams was looking at running.  He had a sense of condemnation and it was through his career that he could prove himself,  that he mattered, that he could accomplish something and when something went wrong with  it, when something went wrong with the career, he felt absolutely condemned and he was furious  and he was paralyzed because of the very foundations of his identity were falling apart.  And it wasn't until we were able to do analysis like that.  It wasn't able until he began to understand he had set his mind on the flesh that this  was his approach to self-salvation, that he began to say, wait a minute, wait a minute.  It's not just, I have to forgive the guy, yes.  The reason I can't forgive the guy, it's not just that I have to get back on the horse  and work hard.  But the reason I have to, the real problem I have underneath is something besides Jesus  Christ is functioning as my savior.  And there always is something underneath your inordinate, not a control problems, desires,  attitudes, emotions, that's always down there.  And until you find it, you can't have life in peace, until you find it, you're going  to find things falling apart in your life that's called death.  So first of all, you have the support in the gospel, to be honest about what needs to  be changed.  Then you've got a method in the gospel to identify what you set your mind on so you  can understand where you need to change.  And then the third question is, wait, wait.  How does that poor guy now really turn the corner?  Here's what was going on.  The guy was a professing Christian, oh yeah he was.  But, and he said, look, I technically, I believe that there's no condemnation for those  who are in Christ Jesus.  And technically, I believe that I'm loved, but here's the simple fact, I should be able  to say, the king of the universe loves me.  Who cares what my boss thinks, but I can't.  Because what my boss thinks is more real to me than what the king of the universe says.  That's just, you know, what the boss says is on video, but what the king of the universe  says is sort of on audio.  I know with my head, but I don't know with my heart, and that's the third thing.  Where do you get the power to really make this change?  And the answer is, it's actually in verse 13, but it's also in verse 5 and 6.  Verse 13 says, you have to put to death the deeds of the body, you have to destroy and  root out your fleshly way of living, your self-savations projects by the spirit.  By the spirit.  And up in verse 5 it says, you don't have to take your mind off of the things of the flesh.  You have to, you have to destroy the self-savation projects.  How?  By minding the things of the spirit.  Now what does that mean?  By minding the things of the spirit.  See, this is where we move away from a pure technique.  Now we're not completely in control here, everybody.  You can't just pick up the Holy Spirit like a scissors or like a screwdriver and start  to use the Holy Spirit.  But here's what it's saying.  What does it mean to mind the things of the spirit?  Don't forget, minding is more than thinking, remember?  To mind the things of the spirit means your whole heart, mind, and being are enthralled  captivated by something.  See, they're all brought together, they're engrossed in, they're preoccupied in, they're  captured by something.  Your imagination is captured by something, what?  And John chapter 14, 15 and 16, Jesus says, when the Holy Spirit comes, he will take  the things that I'm telling you, he will take my teachings and he will manifest them  to you.  Now this is it.  You may have the teachings, they may be on a piece of paper, you may say it's okay, but  the Holy Spirit's job is to make them real to you.  It's the Holy Spirit's job to smite you with the beauty of Jesus Christ and what he's  done until you weep and the penny begins to drop.  And what he says about you is more real than what your boss says about you or what anybody  says about you.  There's a great place where John done in one of his sonnet says, and listen carefully,  it's really, really amazing language.  He's speaking to Jesus and he says, take me to you, imprison me, for I accept you and  throw me, never shall be free, nor ever chaste, except you ravish me.  I'll never be chaste, I'll never have self control.  What he's really trying to say here is a love of this person or that person will be far  more real than the love of you for my soul.  And the only way I'm ever going to have self control, the only way I'm going to be  able to forgive my boss, the only way I'm going to be able to not worry about money, the  only way I'm going to be able to handle the rejection I'm getting in life, the only way  I can walk through life at large.  See, without it all pulling me down is I need the ministry of the Holy Spirit to make  what Jesus Christ has done for me so real that I weep with the beauty of it and the  penny drops and I'm off.  That replaces those other things in the core of my being which I'm trying to push there  to the center of my being.  That's what does it.  That's the change.  You say, well, how does that happen?  Well, God gives us an idea here.  Paul gives an idea in verse three.  It says, for God has done with the law, we can buy the flesh, could not do.  Look, by sending his son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemns him.  Now, the little word for sin, boy, I know that looks so innocuous on the page, but  it's all experts and commentators and scholars understand that that is a technical term  all through the Old Testament, the Septuagint, for sin offering.  And here's what it says.  It's not enough just to say, oh, you need to just know God loves you in general.  You've got to fix your mind on what?  You've got to let the Holy Spirit show you what?  How Jesus Christ was condemned in your place.  Now Jesus Christ sacrifcially gave himself and was condemned in your place.  And what you're doing, you first study that, you learn that.  That's the heart of the gospel.  And then you spend the rest of your life letting the Holy Spirit amass radioactive material  to work on the tumors of your heart.  See, why do I say tumors?  Sin is a tumor, you know, cancer, what is cancer?  Cancer is just cell growth gone bad, so it's going to kill you.  And what is sin?  It's self-centeredness, self-absorption, self-concentration.  It's going to kill you unless you kill it first.  And what is the radioactive isotope that will shrink and kill those tumors before they kill  you?  It's what Jesus Christ did on the cross, illuminated by the Holy Spirit.  Now there's going to be texts.  There's so diverse, there's every person who has grown in grace and has bit by bit been  changed, has put the death, the self-salvation of the body, the self-salvation of the soul,  and slowly, more and more lived large, lived free, lived loved.  Anyone who's been through that, you've got a kind of a secret thread of texts and movies  and passages and biblical texts and sermons and things like that.  But over the years, the Holy Spirit grabs hold of because of who you are and where you  are at the time and turns it into a radioactive material which you can get out the rest of  your life and use to shrink those tumors when you know that they're starting to grow back.  You know, Kathy and I have got a, you know, for example, Duncan, at the end of last  the Mohicans, the British officer who dies in the fire, arms outstretched, crucify the  save a life of Korra.  Does that get to you?  Maybe not to you.  But it's part of the radioactive materials that the Holy Spirit's given us.  First Corinthians 1, God made the foolish things of the world, use the foolish things of  the world to shame the wise.  He uses the weak things of the world to shame the strong, he uses even the lowly and despised  things, even the things that are not to bring to nothing and things that are, so that's  kind of moving to me.  Yeah, but for us, this is one of the radioactive parts, this is some of the material that  the Holy Spirit is using to destroy the self-salvation.  You can find it anywhere.  At the end of the Iron Giant, the Great Cartoon, the Iron Giant, he takes a nuke to save  the people, and it gets resurrected to some incredible music, you see.  I can't, Kathy and I can't watch that without weeping about Jesus, and you might say, you  know, T.  But let me really show you how it works.  At the end of the tale of two cities, Sidney Carton resembles Charles Darnay.  Charles Darnay is in the Bastille, I guess, and he's been sentenced to death, he's condemned,  and he's going to be guillotined, right?  Sidney Carton breaks in stealthily to the jail.  Knox Charles Darnay out, and some of his companions take the unconscious man and unconscious  man and steal him out of the jail, and Sidney Carton takes his place, takes his clothes,  and waits to die in his place.  And the next day, there's a young girl, a young woman who's also been condemned to die,  and she comes up thinking he's Charles Darnay begins to talk, but then realizes it's not  sees his face and realizes it's not, and her eyes get really big.  And she says, are you dying for him?  And he says, yes.  See that begins to shrink my tumors.  The old King James Bible, in verse 13, said, you must mortify the deeds of the flesh.  You must mortify your false saviors, and you will live.  Of course today, that word mortification just means embarrassed, so we don't use the word  anymore.  In the old days, it meant to put something in the mortuary, but you know what?  When I hear Sidney Carton say, yes, I'm dying for him.  It shrinks my tumors.  It mortifies my stupid, egocentric heart that's always worried about what I'm getting here  and what I'm getting there.  And if somebody is noticing me and might get it, it mortifies with joy.  The joy of what Jesus Christ has done for me, it mortifies my ego into silence, so it's  not bothering me as much.  And it's not bothering you as much.  Are you dying for him?  And he says, yes, for him and his wife.  And then she takes hold of his hand and says, stranger, it's going to be hard for me to die.  But if I could hold the hand of someone so brave and so courageous and loving as you,  I think I can face it.  And he says, all right.  She was smitten by the wonder of his substitutionary sacrifice for somebody else.  How much more when Holy Spirit shows you what Jesus Christ has done for you?  Will you be able to put the death of things that are putting you to death?  Let us pray.  Thank you, Father, for giving us a method, a power, and a freedom to really change.  We ask that you would help us now to get some more spiritually radioactive material for  the things in our hearts that are harming us and the people around us.  We're going to the Lord's table.  And we pray that you would be real to us by the power of the Spirit.  To change us into your own image, we ask it in Jesus' name, amen.  Thanks for joining us here on The Gospel and Life Podcast.

欢迎来到《福音人生》。什么是通过喜乐的自我否定？这是当我们放弃我们对属世东西的渴望，因为我们在基督里找到更大的喜乐。当我们拥抱基督时，虚假的欢乐失去其吸引力。
