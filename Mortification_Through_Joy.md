## English Transcript / 英文原文

Today, Tim Keller explores how lasting change actually happens in the life of a Christian  and why the Gospel offers a radically different process of transformation than anything  else. The Scripture reading tonight is found on page 9 of the bulletin and it's Romans 8, 1-13. There's therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin  and death. For God has done what the law weakened by the flesh could not do.

By sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemns sin in the  flesh in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who  walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh,  but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and  peace. For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law,  indeed it cannot. Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.

You however are not in the flesh but in the Spirit. If in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you, anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ  does not belong to him. But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life  because of righteousness. If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ  Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells  in you. So then, brothers, we are deaders, not to the flesh to live according to the flesh.

For if you live according to the flesh, you will die. But if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live. This is God's Word. I think I've said every week that when I first embraced the Christian faith, there was  a number of things in my life that profoundly needed changing, but nothing seemed to work  until some writers, some Christian writers, took me to Romans 6, 7 and 8, and when I began  to understand the teaching of Romans 6, 7 and 8, my life began to change. And so in this brief series, I'm taking you to Romans 6, 7 and 8.

And the question is, how does Christ, how does faith in Christ actually lead to real  change in one's life? Today we get to Romans 8 and we see that in Jesus we get three things, quite relevant for  the subject, three things we get. We get a new freedom to know ourselves, let me put it in the second person. We get a new freedom, you get a new freedom to know yourself. You get a new method to change yourself, and you get a new power to be yourself.

You get a new freedom to know, method to change, power to be yourself, point one. New freedom to know yourself, Romans 7, which we looked at last week, right up to verse  1, that is Romans 8, verse 1, right up to verse 22, 23, 24 of the end of chapter 7, is  saying this, that in every one of us, there is a dark mass, even the best of us, even the  St. Paul's, there's a dark mass of self-absorption, self-concentration, self-centeredness. And as far worse than any of us want to admit, and it makes us capable of terrible sin  and evil. And then immediately after saying that, is Paul saying this is true of you, it's true  of me, it's true of all of us, the moment he says that, he turns then to verse 1 of chapter  8.

And he says simultaneously, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. And no condemnation, the word condemnation is Greek word, kata, kreena, which means to  have a judgment against, to be condemned or to be guilty means there's something against  you that there is, that you're liable for something and you're in a state of astrangement  until you pay your debt, let's say to society. But this is saying that though we not only are capable of wrongdoing, but we're doing  wrong at the same moment with regard to God, nothing we have ever done brings us into  condemnation. With regard to God, there is no liability. And this word no, therefore now no condemnation.

That word no is too strong a word to convey with any one particular English word because  it's not a word that means there's now for the moment no condemnation. This word no means, there's no more condemnation for Christians, no longer exists. It's been destroyed, never again, that's what it's saying. So Romans 7 is just saying we are capable of tremendous evil and immediately says at  the same time simultaneously, if you're in Christ, none of that can ever bring you into condemnation  with regard to God. Now this is astounding and it's unique.

There's a place in Luke 11 where Jesus is speaking to his disciples and he's actually  teaching them about prayer and he says this, Luke 11, he says to his disciples, if you then  though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more you're  Heavenly Father, you who are evil, no, think about this. He's talking to the people he loves, that he delights in, that he's going to die for,  that he's unconditionally committed to, but he's also saying, well, can you hear Jesus  saying this to you? I love you. I will never forsake you. I'm unconditionally committed to you.

I delight in you, but you're evil, you know? Have you heard that? Because if you have, you have something that no, from what I can tell, no system of thought,  no philosophy, no religion, east, west, individualistic, collectivistic, liberal, conservative can  give you. You know, there's a liberal, a liberal mindset that never calls anyone sinful or evil including  yourself because you see all problems are really functions of psychological or sociological  dynamics and when you really do something, far more cruel or cowardly or worse than anything  you ever thought you were capable of, you've got no category for it, you'll go into denial. But there's a conservative mindset and there's a conservative mindset who does use the  term sinful and evil for people over there and whose very identity is based on the idea  that I'm not one of them.

I'm one of the virtuous people. I'm not like those relativists, those anarchists, I'm one of the virtuous people. And when you find yourself, and you will, doing things worse, more cruel, more cowardly  than anything you've ever done, you won't have a category for it, you won't know how  to deal with it, you will go into denial. But the gospel of Jesus, Jesus attitude, Jesus statement, if you're in Christ, you are  simultaneously evil and absolutely loved, gives us a freedom, when you say, well, that's  crazy, that's contradictory, yeah, yeah, it's crazy, admittedly, it's really weird. But let me show you how great it is.

Because first of all, it gives you an unmatched, unique, sociological freedom. What I mean by that is, you don't have to divide, you can't, if you understand this, divide  the world anymore into the good guys, the bad guys. Some people say there's the good people, then there's the liberals. Some say there's the good people, then there's the fundamentalists. Everybody's saying there's a good bad, but if you're a Christian, if you have any understanding  of this, you know, you know that the difference between you and a prostitute, you and a murderer,  you and a Nazi.

The only difference between you and them is that the seeds in your heart that make you  capable of being or doing that just never got watered, so they never sprouted. And therefore you have the freedom, in Christ we have the freedom, to find common humanity  with people, anybody, we sense our common fragile humanity, we don't write people off, and  we don't call the people, those people, the other with capital O, but it's also even  more importantly, the gospel gives you psychological freedom, to handle things that you are going  to do, and then you won't have to deny or spin them or repress them and make it impossible  for you to know who you are, because I don't believe there's any other, only with that support  of saying, look, you're capable of terrible things, and I'm absolutely unconditionally committed  to you since Jesus. If you've got that kind of support, will you really be able to be honest? Oh, you say, this idea of calling yourself a sinner, that's emotionally unhealthy, you  say, oh no, oh no, it's emotionally unhealthy not to be able to call yourself a sinner. Can I give you an example?

One true account that has really affected Kathy and my understanding of this is that years  ago, when we were in Virginia, in our area, these aren't people we knew personally, in  our area, a terrible thing happened in the late 70s, to a young married couple. They had three children, they were strapped into an automobile, the automobile ended up going  in without any drivers in it. The automobile went into a lake or a pond, and all three children were killed. They're all drowned, horrible tragedy. But at the funeral, the husband and wife, to everyone's surprise, really testified to  their faith in God, and they seemed to be so incredibly spiritually strong, that everyone  for miles around, were just talking about what incredibly faithful, good Christian people  they are, what faith in God, and they did.

They picked themselves up, and they had more children, and they built a new family, and  they, of course, were pillars in the church, and the husband was an officer in the church,  he was a pillar in the church, 20 years later, we were in another church, and we heard  a minister tell a story about a man, and even though he rightly so did not use the man's  name, it was very, very clear, it was very obvious to us, this is the same guy, the father. And he talked about the fact that this man had gone through incredible trouble, losing  all three children, and he was a pillar of this community, and a pillar of his church,  but they had come to the pastor, many years later, in absolute agony, because he had discovered,  he had found that he was very strongly sexually attracted to a woman in the church that  wasn't his wife, and he had very strong feelings, and a very strong attraction, and he  was struggling, and he was an agony, and he was, he experienced horrible guilt, he, the  pillar of the church, an officer in the church, how could he feel this way, how could he  do this, how could he want this? And the pastor said this story was that he got a lot of counseling, he got good counseling,  got professional counseling, he got spiritual counseling, but in the end, he killed himself. Now, is that just a sad story? Oh, yes, of course it's a sad story, but listen to me.

Here's a man who could handle the worst suffering that the world could give to him, but couldn't  handle the possibility that he was a sinner. And are you going to tell me it's emotionally unhealthy to be able to call yourself a sinner? For him, it was the absolute opposite of emotional disc health, unhealthy. To be able to say, I am capable of terrible things, but I'm unconditionally loved, is  the epitome of mental health. And it's the gospel that gives us that.

The gospel gives you freedom to admit who you are when the information comes. To see where you do need to change, the freedom to know yourself, point one, point two. The second thing we learn here is the gospel gives you a new method for change, a method. Up in verse three, there's another reiteration of one of the themes of Romans seven. It says, for God has done what the law weakened by the flesh could not do.

And remember, we talked about this last week, one of the points that Paul makes in Romans seven  is that we've got all this self-centeredness and this self-absorption and this self-concentration. We've got this mass in us that's making our own lives miserable with this self-concentration. It makes our lives miserable people around us. What are we going to do about it? And what we usually do is we apply willpower and we see the moral law and we say we're  going to live up to the moral law.

And Paul is pointing out here he's summarizing what he said in Romans seven that that doesn't  help you because you know self-centeredness and self-righteousness can take a moral form  as well as an immoral form. You can be a Pharisee as well as a criminal and still make the world a mess of a place. So what are we supposed to do in order to change ourselves? The answer is verse 13, here it is, for if you live according to the flesh, you will  die, but if by the Spirit you put the death, the deeds of the body you will live. If by the Spirit you put the death, the deeds of the body you will live.

Now in Romans six and Romans seven, and I'm afraid to prove this exegetically, you'd have  to go back to the sermons, I can't recapitulate here, but in Romans six and seven we learn that  when Paul talks about the flesh, he's not talking about the physical body. When Paul talks about the deeds of the body or the deeds of the flesh, he's talking about  the whole life being controlled by a self-salvation project, that what Paul means by living in the  flesh means to be your own Savior, to be your own Lord, to try to instead of letting  God be your Savior and Lord, and everything in your life, everything that your body  does, everything your whole life does, everything in your life, all your actions and attitudes  and everything is controlled by an effort to be your own Savior and Lord. It's a self-salvation project, that's what it means to live according to the flesh and  live in the flesh. And what he's saying in verse 13 is fascinating. He says, if you live according to the flesh, you will die, but if you root out and destroy  your particular ways of trying to save yourself, if you root out and destroy your  particular ways of doing self-salvation, you will live.

If you just go with the flow, you will die. If you live according to self-salvation project, you will die. But if you root out and identify and destroy your particular ways of doing self-salvation,  then and only then will you live, will you say, how does that work? What is this new method? At the heart of the new method, verse five and six says, is recognizing and changing  what you mind.

It hasn't changed what you put your mind on. Look at verse four and five. It's just another statement of verse 13. He says, for those who live according to the flesh, see, set their minds on the things  of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things, the  Spirit. To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life, wow,  and peace.

Now if you must keep this in mind, unpack this. First of all, in the Bible, mind and heart are not two different things. Yes, in English, in our way of thinking, mind means the reason and the cognition and  heart means the emotions, but not in the Bible. Mind and the heart are the core of the being. And therefore, when Paul says, you set your mind on the flesh, he's not just saying,  you have bad thoughts.

And he's not even talking only about thoughts. Here's what he's saying. He's asking you to look at yourself and recognize what preoccupies you. What engrosses you the most. What is your heart most engrossed in?

Where are your dreams? Where do they reside? What has captured your imagination? What most preoccupies and engrosses, the very core of your thinking and your dreaming  and your fantasizing and your heart and your mind because, Paul says, whatever that is,  is always your way of justifying yourself, your way of proving yourself, your way of developing  your own sense of value and worth, and therefore, that's your way of being your own Savior  and Lord. You say, would you please flesh that out, yes.

The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God, even Jesus relied on the Psalms  to face every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365-day devotional, the songs of Jesus, you'll find daily readings  through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start, and if  you already spend time and study and prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms  can help you bring your deepest emotions and questions before God and discover a new  level of intimacy with Him. We'll send you Tim and Kathy Keller's devotional as our thanks for your gift to help Gospel  and Life share the love of Jesus with more people. I've just recently realized, I mean, I just found to my fascination, that when the movie  Chariots of Fire in 1981 was made, a true story of two British men, Harold Abrams and  Eric Little, who won gold medals for Britain in the 1924 Paris Olympics.

I didn't realize that when that film came out in 1981, Jenny Little, Eric Little's sister  was still alive. Eric Little went on to be a missionary in China and died in a detention camp in China during  World War II. But Jenny, who's also depicted in the movie, lived through to the place where she had  an interview after the movie came out, and one of the things that she said was one thing  that bothered her a little bit about the movie was there's only one scene in which is  the glimpse of this, and if you know the movie, you know which one it is. But she says the thing the movie didn't show is that every time, whenever Eric, her brother,  who was a world-class runner, sprinter, a hundred-yard dash, and so on, whenever Eric ran,  he always ran with his face straight up to the sky and his mouth wide open, looking like  a crazy man. He always ran with his face smack up to the sky, facing directly with his mouth open.

He looked crazy, he looked eccentric, but he was worshipping. Because Harold Abrams and Eric Little were both setting their mind on the same thing. They wanted to run, they wanted to win, and they wanted to run and win a race. But for totally different reasons. Because when Harold Abrams is asked, why are you running?

He describes the hundred-yard dash and he says, when that gun goes off, I've got ten seconds,  he says, quote unquote, to justify my existence. And what he's saying is, only if I can win this race, if I can be an accomplished athlete,  and I know I matter, then I can face the world because I've accomplished this thing. But of course, Eric Little in the movie says to Jenny, Jenny, God made me fast. And when I run, I feel his pleasure. Now listen, here's one guy and he's running to praise his Savior, and here's the other  guy who's running to become his own Savior.

They said so. Here's one guy who is running for the sheer joy of it. It's icing on the cake. If he wins great, if he doesn't win great, because he's already justified. His life is justified.

Here's the other guy who's running in grinding anxiety, churning and grinding down, anxiety  and fear, because he's seeking to be justified. He said so. And by the way, as you know, in the movie, even after he wins, he finds it unsatisfying  because idols never deliver. Now you begin to understand, to set the mind on the flesh is not just having bad thoughts. It's essentially to put your mind and your heart on something besides Jesus Christ as  functional Savior.

And to see how that actually works, let me just give you another kind of example. I remember some years ago, many years ago, counseling two young men at the same time. Both of them had just lost their jobs because their bosses had been pretty stupid and wrong  and unfair. Because of an unfair action, the part of their bosses, they both lost their job and they  both had a blot on their career record. But Guy A, pretty much got over it, forgave the boss, moved on, and sin was doing so well  that he more than compensated for that little blot, it essentially was a non-issue.

The other guy couldn't get past it. He stayed very bitter, stayed incredibly cynical, and it was affecting his career, it was affecting  his job, it was affecting his whole future career path. I've ever sit down with that second guy and a lot of people have been trying to help him. And some people try to work directly on his emotions and the way you work directly on  the emotions is you say, oh, you know, you're sympathy and you're talking about how hard  it's been and how awful it's been and you're trying to help the person and the problem  is the more sympathy that people showed him, the more he felt justified in how angry  he was and the more his self-pity grew and grew and he got worse. Other people try to work right on his will.

They said, come on, buck up, don't let the bastards get you down, just forgive it, get  past it, didn't help either. Because the gospel, however, is different. For the gospel doesn't work directly on the emotions and say, oh, you know, God loves  you in some general way, though he does. And the gospel doesn't direct directly on the will and say, now, you have to do the  right thing. Of course, you do have to do the right thing.

But the gospel says, what is functioning in the place of Jesus Christ as your real functional  salvation and savior? What are you looking to to justify yourself and see what happened was the one guy cared  about his career and the other guy cared about his career. But the second guy was looking at his career, the way Harold Abrams was looking at running. He had a sense of condemnation and it was through his career that he could prove himself,  that he mattered, that he could accomplish something and when something went wrong with  it, when something went wrong with the career, he felt absolutely condemned and he was furious  and he was paralyzed because of the very foundations of his identity were falling apart. And it wasn't until we were able to do analysis like that.

It wasn't able until he began to understand he had set his mind on the flesh that this  was his approach to self-salvation, that he began to say, wait a minute, wait a minute. It's not just, I have to forgive the guy, yes. The reason I can't forgive the guy, it's not just that I have to get back on the horse  and work hard. But the reason I have to, the real problem I have underneath is something besides Jesus  Christ is functioning as my savior. And there always is something underneath your inordinate, not a control problems, desires,  attitudes, emotions, that's always down there.

And until you find it, you can't have life in peace, until you find it, you're going  to find things falling apart in your life that's called death. So first of all, you have the support in the gospel, to be honest about what needs to  be changed. Then you've got a method in the gospel to identify what you set your mind on so you  can understand where you need to change. And then the third question is, wait, wait. How does that poor guy now really turn the corner?

Here's what was going on. The guy was a professing Christian, oh yeah he was. But, and he said, look, I technically, I believe that there's no condemnation for those  who are in Christ Jesus. And technically, I believe that I'm loved, but here's the simple fact, I should be able  to say, the king of the universe loves me. Who cares what my boss thinks, but I can't.

Because what my boss thinks is more real to me than what the king of the universe says. That's just, you know, what the boss says is on video, but what the king of the universe  says is sort of on audio. I know with my head, but I don't know with my heart, and that's the third thing. Where do you get the power to really make this change? And the answer is, it's actually in verse 13, but it's also in verse 5 and 6.

Verse 13 says, you have to put to death the deeds of the body, you have to destroy and  root out your fleshly way of living, your self-savations projects by the spirit. By the spirit. And up in verse 5 it says, you don't have to take your mind off of the things of the flesh. You have to, you have to destroy the self-savation projects. How?

By minding the things of the spirit. Now what does that mean? By minding the things of the spirit. See, this is where we move away from a pure technique. Now we're not completely in control here, everybody.

You can't just pick up the Holy Spirit like a scissors or like a screwdriver and start  to use the Holy Spirit. But here's what it's saying. What does it mean to mind the things of the spirit? Don't forget, minding is more than thinking, remember? To mind the things of the spirit means your whole heart, mind, and being are enthralled  captivated by something.

See, they're all brought together, they're engrossed in, they're preoccupied in, they're  captured by something. Your imagination is captured by something, what? And John chapter 14, 15 and 16, Jesus says, when the Holy Spirit comes, he will take  the things that I'm telling you, he will take my teachings and he will manifest them  to you. Now this is it. You may have the teachings, they may be on a piece of paper, you may say it's okay, but  the Holy Spirit's job is to make them real to you.

It's the Holy Spirit's job to smite you with the beauty of Jesus Christ and what he's  done until you weep and the penny begins to drop. And what he says about you is more real than what your boss says about you or what anybody  says about you. There's a great place where John done in one of his sonnet says, and listen carefully,  it's really, really amazing language. He's speaking to Jesus and he says, take me to you, imprison me, for I accept you and  throw me, never shall be free, nor ever chaste, except you ravish me. I'll never be chaste, I'll never have self control.

What he's really trying to say here is a love of this person or that person will be far  more real than the love of you for my soul. And the only way I'm ever going to have self control, the only way I'm going to be  able to forgive my boss, the only way I'm going to be able to not worry about money, the  only way I'm going to be able to handle the rejection I'm getting in life, the only way  I can walk through life at large. See, without it all pulling me down is I need the ministry of the Holy Spirit to make  what Jesus Christ has done for me so real that I weep with the beauty of it and the  penny drops and I'm off. That replaces those other things in the core of my being which I'm trying to push there  to the center of my being. That's what does it.

That's the change. You say, well, how does that happen? Well, God gives us an idea here. Paul gives an idea in verse three. It says, for God has done with the law, we can buy the flesh, could not do.

Look, by sending his son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemns him. Now, the little word for sin, boy, I know that looks so innocuous on the page, but  it's all experts and commentators and scholars understand that that is a technical term  all through the Old Testament, the Septuagint, for sin offering. And here's what it says. It's not enough just to say, oh, you need to just know God loves you in general. You've got to fix your mind on what?

You've got to let the Holy Spirit show you what? How Jesus Christ was condemned in your place. Now Jesus Christ sacrifcially gave himself and was condemned in your place. And what you're doing, you first study that, you learn that. That's the heart of the gospel.

And then you spend the rest of your life letting the Holy Spirit amass radioactive material  to work on the tumors of your heart. See, why do I say tumors? Sin is a tumor, you know, cancer, what is cancer? Cancer is just cell growth gone bad, so it's going to kill you. And what is sin?

It's self-centeredness, self-absorption, self-concentration. It's going to kill you unless you kill it first. And what is the radioactive isotope that will shrink and kill those tumors before they kill  you? It's what Jesus Christ did on the cross, illuminated by the Holy Spirit. Now there's going to be texts.

There's so diverse, there's every person who has grown in grace and has bit by bit been  changed, has put the death, the self-salvation of the body, the self-salvation of the soul,  and slowly, more and more lived large, lived free, lived loved. Anyone who's been through that, you've got a kind of a secret thread of texts and movies  and passages and biblical texts and sermons and things like that. But over the years, the Holy Spirit grabs hold of because of who you are and where you  are at the time and turns it into a radioactive material which you can get out the rest of  your life and use to shrink those tumors when you know that they're starting to grow back. You know, Kathy and I have got a, you know, for example, Duncan, at the end of last  the Mohicans, the British officer who dies in the fire, arms outstretched, crucify the  save a life of Korra. Does that get to you?

Maybe not to you. But it's part of the radioactive materials that the Holy Spirit's given us. First Corinthians 1, God made the foolish things of the world, use the foolish things of  the world to shame the wise. He uses the weak things of the world to shame the strong, he uses even the lowly and despised  things, even the things that are not to bring to nothing and things that are, so that's  kind of moving to me. Yeah, but for us, this is one of the radioactive parts, this is some of the material that  the Holy Spirit is using to destroy the self-salvation.

You can find it anywhere. At the end of the Iron Giant, the Great Cartoon, the Iron Giant, he takes a nuke to save  the people, and it gets resurrected to some incredible music, you see. I can't, Kathy and I can't watch that without weeping about Jesus, and you might say, you  know, T. But let me really show you how it works. At the end of the tale of two cities, Sidney Carton resembles Charles Darnay.

Charles Darnay is in the Bastille, I guess, and he's been sentenced to death, he's condemned,  and he's going to be guillotined, right? Sidney Carton breaks in stealthily to the jail. Knox Charles Darnay out, and some of his companions take the unconscious man and unconscious  man and steal him out of the jail, and Sidney Carton takes his place, takes his clothes,  and waits to die in his place. And the next day, there's a young girl, a young woman who's also been condemned to die,  and she comes up thinking he's Charles Darnay begins to talk, but then realizes it's not  sees his face and realizes it's not, and her eyes get really big. And she says, are you dying for him?

And he says, yes. See that begins to shrink my tumors. The old King James Bible, in verse 13, said, you must mortify the deeds of the flesh. You must mortify your false saviors, and you will live. Of course today, that word mortification just means embarrassed, so we don't use the word  anymore.

In the old days, it meant to put something in the mortuary, but you know what? When I hear Sidney Carton say, yes, I'm dying for him. It shrinks my tumors. It mortifies my stupid, egocentric heart that's always worried about what I'm getting here  and what I'm getting there. And if somebody is noticing me and might get it, it mortifies with joy.

The joy of what Jesus Christ has done for me, it mortifies my ego into silence, so it's  not bothering me as much. And it's not bothering you as much. Are you dying for him? And he says, yes, for him and his wife. And then she takes hold of his hand and says, stranger, it's going to be hard for me to die.

But if I could hold the hand of someone so brave and so courageous and loving as you,  I think I can face it. And he says, all right. She was smitten by the wonder of his substitutionary sacrifice for somebody else. How much more when Holy Spirit shows you what Jesus Christ has done for you? Will you be able to put the death of things that are putting you to death?

Let us pray. Thank you, Father, for giving us a method, a power, and a freedom to really change. We ask that you would help us now to get some more spiritually radioactive material for  the things in our hearts that are harming us and the people around us. We're going to the Lord's table. And we pray that you would be real to us by the power of the Spirit.

To change us into your own image, we ask it in Jesus' name, amen.

Today, Tim Keller explores how lasting change actually happens in the life of a Christian  and why the Gospel offers a radically different process of transformation than anything  else. The Scripture reading tonight is found on page 9 of the bulletin and it's Romans 8, 1-13. There's therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin  and death. For God has done what the law weakened by the flesh could not do.

By sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemns sin in the  flesh in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who  walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh,  but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and  peace. For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law,  indeed it cannot. Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.

You however are not in the flesh but in the Spirit. If in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you, anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ  does not belong to him. But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life  because of righteousness. If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ  Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells  in you. So then, brothers, we are deaders, not to the flesh to live according to the flesh.

For if you live according to the flesh, you will die. But if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live. This is God's Word. I think I've said every week that when I first embraced the Christian faith, there was  a number of things in my life that profoundly needed changing, but nothing seemed to work  until some writers, some Christian writers, took me to Romans 6, 7 and 8, and when I began  to understand the teaching of Romans 6, 7 and 8, my life began to change. And so in this brief series, I'm taking you to Romans 6, 7 and 8.

And the question is, how does Christ, how does faith in Christ actually lead to real  change in one's life? Today we get to Romans 8 and we see that in Jesus we get three things, quite relevant for  the subject, three things we get. We get a new freedom to know ourselves, let me put it in the second person. We get a new freedom, you get a new freedom to know yourself. You get a new method to change yourself, and you get a new power to be yourself.

You get a new freedom to know, method to change, power to be yourself, point one. New freedom to know yourself, Romans 7, which we looked at last week, right up to verse  1, that is Romans 8, verse 1, right up to verse 22, 23, 24 of the end of chapter 7, is  saying this, that in every one of us, there is a dark mass, even the best of us, even the  St. Paul's, there's a dark mass of self-absorption, self-concentration, self-centeredness. And as far worse than any of us want to admit, and it makes us capable of terrible sin  and evil. And then immediately after saying that, is Paul saying this is true of you, it's true  of me, it's true of all of us, the moment he says that, he turns then to verse 1 of chapter  8.

And he says simultaneously, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. And no condemnation, the word condemnation is Greek word, kata, kreena, which means to  have a judgment against, to be condemned or to be guilty means there's something against  you that there is, that you're liable for something and you're in a state of astrangement  until you pay your debt, let's say to society. But this is saying that though we not only are capable of wrongdoing, but we're doing  wrong at the same moment with regard to God, nothing we have ever done brings us into  condemnation. With regard to God, there is no liability. And this word no, therefore now no condemnation.

That word no is too strong a word to convey with any one particular English word because  it's not a word that means there's now for the moment no condemnation. This word no means, there's no more condemnation for Christians, no longer exists. It's been destroyed, never again, that's what it's saying. So Romans 7 is just saying we are capable of tremendous evil and immediately says at  the same time simultaneously, if you're in Christ, none of that can ever bring you into condemnation  with regard to God. Now this is astounding and it's unique.

There's a place in Luke 11 where Jesus is speaking to his disciples and he's actually  teaching them about prayer and he says this, Luke 11, he says to his disciples, if you then  though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more you're  Heavenly Father, you who are evil, no, think about this. He's talking to the people he loves, that he delights in, that he's going to die for,  that he's unconditionally committed to, but he's also saying, well, can you hear Jesus  saying this to you? I love you. I will never forsake you. I'm unconditionally committed to you.

I delight in you, but you're evil, you know? Have you heard that? Because if you have, you have something that no, from what I can tell, no system of thought,  no philosophy, no religion, east, west, individualistic, collectivistic, liberal, conservative can  give you. You know, there's a liberal, a liberal mindset that never calls anyone sinful or evil including  yourself because you see all problems are really functions of psychological or sociological  dynamics and when you really do something, far more cruel or cowardly or worse than anything  you ever thought you were capable of, you've got no category for it, you'll go into denial. But there's a conservative mindset and there's a conservative mindset who does use the  term sinful and evil for people over there and whose very identity is based on the idea  that I'm not one of them.

I'm one of the virtuous people. I'm not like those relativists, those anarchists, I'm one of the virtuous people. And when you find yourself, and you will, doing things worse, more cruel, more cowardly  than anything you've ever done, you won't have a category for it, you won't know how  to deal with it, you will go into denial. But the gospel of Jesus, Jesus attitude, Jesus statement, if you're in Christ, you are  simultaneously evil and absolutely loved, gives us a freedom, when you say, well, that's  crazy, that's contradictory, yeah, yeah, it's crazy, admittedly, it's really weird. But let me show you how great it is.

Because first of all, it gives you an unmatched, unique, sociological freedom. What I mean by that is, you don't have to divide, you can't, if you understand this, divide  the world anymore into the good guys, the bad guys. Some people say there's the good people, then there's the liberals. Some say there's the good people, then there's the fundamentalists. Everybody's saying there's a good bad, but if you're a Christian, if you have any understanding  of this, you know, you know that the difference between you and a prostitute, you and a murderer,  you and a Nazi.

The only difference between you and them is that the seeds in your heart that make you  capable of being or doing that just never got watered, so they never sprouted. And therefore you have the freedom, in Christ we have the freedom, to find common humanity  with people, anybody, we sense our common fragile humanity, we don't write people off, and  we don't call the people, those people, the other with capital O, but it's also even  more importantly, the gospel gives you psychological freedom, to handle things that you are going  to do, and then you won't have to deny or spin them or repress them and make it impossible  for you to know who you are, because I don't believe there's any other, only with that support  of saying, look, you're capable of terrible things, and I'm absolutely unconditionally committed  to you since Jesus. If you've got that kind of support, will you really be able to be honest? Oh, you say, this idea of calling yourself a sinner, that's emotionally unhealthy, you  say, oh no, oh no, it's emotionally unhealthy not to be able to call yourself a sinner. Can I give you an example?

One true account that has really affected Kathy and my understanding of this is that years  ago, when we were in Virginia, in our area, these aren't people we knew personally, in  our area, a terrible thing happened in the late 70s, to a young married couple. They had three children, they were strapped into an automobile, the automobile ended up going  in without any drivers in it. The automobile went into a lake or a pond, and all three children were killed. They're all drowned, horrible tragedy. But at the funeral, the husband and wife, to everyone's surprise, really testified to  their faith in God, and they seemed to be so incredibly spiritually strong, that everyone  for miles around, were just talking about what incredibly faithful, good Christian people  they are, what faith in God, and they did.

They picked themselves up, and they had more children, and they built a new family, and  they, of course, were pillars in the church, and the husband was an officer in the church,  he was a pillar in the church, 20 years later, we were in another church, and we heard  a minister tell a story about a man, and even though he rightly so did not use the man's  name, it was very, very clear, it was very obvious to us, this is the same guy, the father. And he talked about the fact that this man had gone through incredible trouble, losing  all three children, and he was a pillar of this community, and a pillar of his church,  but they had come to the pastor, many years later, in absolute agony, because he had discovered,  he had found that he was very strongly sexually attracted to a woman in the church that  wasn't his wife, and he had very strong feelings, and a very strong attraction, and he  was struggling, and he was an agony, and he was, he experienced horrible guilt, he, the  pillar of the church, an officer in the church, how could he feel this way, how could he  do this, how could he want this? And the pastor said this story was that he got a lot of counseling, he got good counseling,  got professional counseling, he got spiritual counseling, but in the end, he killed himself. Now, is that just a sad story? Oh, yes, of course it's a sad story, but listen to me.

Here's a man who could handle the worst suffering that the world could give to him, but couldn't  handle the possibility that he was a sinner. And are you going to tell me it's emotionally unhealthy to be able to call yourself a sinner? For him, it was the absolute opposite of emotional disc health, unhealthy. To be able to say, I am capable of terrible things, but I'm unconditionally loved, is  the epitome of mental health. And it's the gospel that gives us that.

The gospel gives you freedom to admit who you are when the information comes. To see where you do need to change, the freedom to know yourself, point one, point two. The second thing we learn here is the gospel gives you a new method for change, a method. Up in verse three, there's another reiteration of one of the themes of Romans seven. It says, for God has done what the law weakened by the flesh could not do.

And remember, we talked about this last week, one of the points that Paul makes in Romans seven  is that we've got all this self-centeredness and this self-absorption and this self-concentration. We've got this mass in us that's making our own lives miserable with this self-concentration. It makes our lives miserable people around us. What are we going to do about it? And what we usually do is we apply willpower and we see the moral law and we say we're  going to live up to the moral law.

And Paul is pointing out here he's summarizing what he said in Romans seven that that doesn't  help you because you know self-centeredness and self-righteousness can take a moral form  as well as an immoral form. You can be a Pharisee as well as a criminal and still make the world a mess of a place. So what are we supposed to do in order to change ourselves? The answer is verse 13, here it is, for if you live according to the flesh, you will  die, but if by the Spirit you put the death, the deeds of the body you will live. If by the Spirit you put the death, the deeds of the body you will live.

Now in Romans six and Romans seven, and I'm afraid to prove this exegetically, you'd have  to go back to the sermons, I can't recapitulate here, but in Romans six and seven we learn that  when Paul talks about the flesh, he's not talking about the physical body. When Paul talks about the deeds of the body or the deeds of the flesh, he's talking about  the whole life being controlled by a self-salvation project, that what Paul means by living in the  flesh means to be your own Savior, to be your own Lord, to try to instead of letting  God be your Savior and Lord, and everything in your life, everything that your body  does, everything your whole life does, everything in your life, all your actions and attitudes  and everything is controlled by an effort to be your own Savior and Lord. It's a self-salvation project, that's what it means to live according to the flesh and  live in the flesh. And what he's saying in verse 13 is fascinating. He says, if you live according to the flesh, you will die, but if you root out and destroy  your particular ways of trying to save yourself, if you root out and destroy your  particular ways of doing self-salvation, you will live.

If you just go with the flow, you will die. If you live according to self-salvation project, you will die. But if you root out and identify and destroy your particular ways of doing self-salvation,  then and only then will you live, will you say, how does that work? What is this new method? At the heart of the new method, verse five and six says, is recognizing and changing  what you mind.

It hasn't changed what you put your mind on. Look at verse four and five. It's just another statement of verse 13. He says, for those who live according to the flesh, see, set their minds on the things  of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things, the  Spirit. To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life, wow,  and peace.

Now if you must keep this in mind, unpack this. First of all, in the Bible, mind and heart are not two different things. Yes, in English, in our way of thinking, mind means the reason and the cognition and  heart means the emotions, but not in the Bible. Mind and the heart are the core of the being. And therefore, when Paul says, you set your mind on the flesh, he's not just saying,  you have bad thoughts.

And he's not even talking only about thoughts. Here's what he's saying. He's asking you to look at yourself and recognize what preoccupies you. What engrosses you the most. What is your heart most engrossed in?

Where are your dreams? Where do they reside? What has captured your imagination? What most preoccupies and engrosses, the very core of your thinking and your dreaming  and your fantasizing and your heart and your mind because, Paul says, whatever that is,  is always your way of justifying yourself, your way of proving yourself, your way of developing  your own sense of value and worth, and therefore, that's your way of being your own Savior  and Lord. You say, would you please flesh that out, yes.

The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God, even Jesus relied on the Psalms  to face every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365-day devotional, the songs of Jesus, you'll find daily readings  through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start, and if  you already spend time and study and prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms  can help you bring your deepest emotions and questions before God and discover a new  level of intimacy with Him. We'll send you Tim and Kathy Keller's devotional as our thanks for your gift to help Gospel  and Life share the love of Jesus with more people. I've just recently realized, I mean, I just found to my fascination, that when the movie  Chariots of Fire in 1981 was made, a true story of two British men, Harold Abrams and  Eric Little, who won gold medals for Britain in the 1924 Paris Olympics.

I didn't realize that when that film came out in 1981, Jenny Little, Eric Little's sister  was still alive. Eric Little went on to be a missionary in China and died in a detention camp in China during  World War II. But Jenny, who's also depicted in the movie, lived through to the place where she had  an interview after the movie came out, and one of the things that she said was one thing  that bothered her a little bit about the movie was there's only one scene in which is  the glimpse of this, and if you know the movie, you know which one it is. But she says the thing the movie didn't show is that every time, whenever Eric, her brother,  who was a world-class runner, sprinter, a hundred-yard dash, and so on, whenever Eric ran,  he always ran with his face straight up to the sky and his mouth wide open, looking like  a crazy man. He always ran with his face smack up to the sky, facing directly with his mouth open.

He looked crazy, he looked eccentric, but he was worshipping. Because Harold Abrams and Eric Little were both setting their mind on the same thing. They wanted to run, they wanted to win, and they wanted to run and win a race. But for totally different reasons. Because when Harold Abrams is asked, why are you running?

He describes the hundred-yard dash and he says, when that gun goes off, I've got ten seconds,  he says, quote unquote, to justify my existence. And what he's saying is, only if I can win this race, if I can be an accomplished athlete,  and I know I matter, then I can face the world because I've accomplished this thing. But of course, Eric Little in the movie says to Jenny, Jenny, God made me fast. And when I run, I feel his pleasure. Now listen, here's one guy and he's running to praise his Savior, and here's the other  guy who's running to become his own Savior.

They said so. Here's one guy who is running for the sheer joy of it. It's icing on the cake. If he wins great, if he doesn't win great, because he's already justified. His life is justified.

Here's the other guy who's running in grinding anxiety, churning and grinding down, anxiety  and fear, because he's seeking to be justified. He said so. And by the way, as you know, in the movie, even after he wins, he finds it unsatisfying  because idols never deliver. Now you begin to understand, to set the mind on the flesh is not just having bad thoughts. It's essentially to put your mind and your heart on something besides Jesus Christ as  functional Savior.

And to see how that actually works, let me just give you another kind of example. I remember some years ago, many years ago, counseling two young men at the same time. Both of them had just lost their jobs because their bosses had been pretty stupid and wrong  and unfair. Because of an unfair action, the part of their bosses, they both lost their job and they  both had a blot on their career record. But Guy A, pretty much got over it, forgave the boss, moved on, and sin was doing so well  that he more than compensated for that little blot, it essentially was a non-issue.

The other guy couldn't get past it. He stayed very bitter, stayed incredibly cynical, and it was affecting his career, it was affecting  his job, it was affecting his whole future career path. I've ever sit down with that second guy and a lot of people have been trying to help him. And some people try to work directly on his emotions and the way you work directly on  the emotions is you say, oh, you know, you're sympathy and you're talking about how hard  it's been and how awful it's been and you're trying to help the person and the problem  is the more sympathy that people showed him, the more he felt justified in how angry  he was and the more his self-pity grew and grew and he got worse. Other people try to work right on his will.

They said, come on, buck up, don't let the bastards get you down, just forgive it, get  past it, didn't help either. Because the gospel, however, is different. For the gospel doesn't work directly on the emotions and say, oh, you know, God loves  you in some general way, though he does. And the gospel doesn't direct directly on the will and say, now, you have to do the  right thing. Of course, you do have to do the right thing.

But the gospel says, what is functioning in the place of Jesus Christ as your real functional  salvation and savior? What are you looking to to justify yourself and see what happened was the one guy cared  about his career and the other guy cared about his career. But the second guy was looking at his career, the way Harold Abrams was looking at running. He had a sense of condemnation and it was through his career that he could prove himself,  that he mattered, that he could accomplish something and when something went wrong with  it, when something went wrong with the career, he felt absolutely condemned and he was furious  and he was paralyzed because of the very foundations of his identity were falling apart. And it wasn't until we were able to do analysis like that.

It wasn't able until he began to understand he had set his mind on the flesh that this  was his approach to self-salvation, that he began to say, wait a minute, wait a minute. It's not just, I have to forgive the guy, yes. The reason I can't forgive the guy, it's not just that I have to get back on the horse  and work hard. But the reason I have to, the real problem I have underneath is something besides Jesus  Christ is functioning as my savior. And there always is something underneath your inordinate, not a control problems, desires,  attitudes, emotions, that's always down there.

And until you find it, you can't have life in peace, until you find it, you're going  to find things falling apart in your life that's called death. So first of all, you have the support in the gospel, to be honest about what needs to  be changed. Then you've got a method in the gospel to identify what you set your mind on so you  can understand where you need to change. And then the third question is, wait, wait. How does that poor guy now really turn the corner?

Here's what was going on. The guy was a professing Christian, oh yeah he was. But, and he said, look, I technically, I believe that there's no condemnation for those  who are in Christ Jesus. And technically, I believe that I'm loved, but here's the simple fact, I should be able  to say, the king of the universe loves me. Who cares what my boss thinks, but I can't.

Because what my boss thinks is more real to me than what the king of the universe says. That's just, you know, what the boss says is on video, but what the king of the universe  says is sort of on audio. I know with my head, but I don't know with my heart, and that's the third thing. Where do you get the power to really make this change? And the answer is, it's actually in verse 13, but it's also in verse 5 and 6.

Verse 13 says, you have to put to death the deeds of the body, you have to destroy and  root out your fleshly way of living, your self-savations projects by the spirit. By the spirit. And up in verse 5 it says, you don't have to take your mind off of the things of the flesh. You have to, you have to destroy the self-savation projects. How?

By minding the things of the spirit. Now what does that mean? By minding the things of the spirit. See, this is where we move away from a pure technique. Now we're not completely in control here, everybody.

You can't just pick up the Holy Spirit like a scissors or like a screwdriver and start  to use the Holy Spirit. But here's what it's saying. What does it mean to mind the things of the spirit? Don't forget, minding is more than thinking, remember? To mind the things of the spirit means your whole heart, mind, and being are enthralled  captivated by something.

See, they're all brought together, they're engrossed in, they're preoccupied in, they're  captured by something. Your imagination is captured by something, what? And John chapter 14, 15 and 16, Jesus says, when the Holy Spirit comes, he will take  the things that I'm telling you, he will take my teachings and he will manifest them  to you. Now this is it. You may have the teachings, they may be on a piece of paper, you may say it's okay, but  the Holy Spirit's job is to make them real to you.

It's the Holy Spirit's job to smite you with the beauty of Jesus Christ and what he's  done until you weep and the penny begins to drop. And what he says about you is more real than what your boss says about you or what anybody  says about you. There's a great place where John done in one of his sonnet says, and listen carefully,  it's really, really amazing language. He's speaking to Jesus and he says, take me to you, imprison me, for I accept you and  throw me, never shall be free, nor ever chaste, except you ravish me. I'll never be chaste, I'll never have self control.

What he's really trying to say here is a love of this person or that person will be far  more real than the love of you for my soul. And the only way I'm ever going to have self control, the only way I'm going to be  able to forgive my boss, the only way I'm going to be able to not worry about money, the  only way I'm going to be able to handle the rejection I'm getting in life, the only way  I can walk through life at large. See, without it all pulling me down is I need the ministry of the Holy Spirit to make  what Jesus Christ has done for me so real that I weep with the beauty of it and the  penny drops and I'm off. That replaces those other things in the core of my being which I'm trying to push there  to the center of my being. That's what does it.

That's the change. You say, well, how does that happen? Well, God gives us an idea here. Paul gives an idea in verse three. It says, for God has done with the law, we can buy the flesh, could not do.

Look, by sending his son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemns him. Now, the little word for sin, boy, I know that looks so innocuous on the page, but  it's all experts and commentators and scholars understand that that is a technical term  all through the Old Testament, the Septuagint, for sin offering. And here's what it says. It's not enough just to say, oh, you need to just know God loves you in general. You've got to fix your mind on what?

You've got to let the Holy Spirit show you what? How Jesus Christ was condemned in your place. Now Jesus Christ sacrifcially gave himself and was condemned in your place. And what you're doing, you first study that, you learn that. That's the heart of the gospel.

And then you spend the rest of your life letting the Holy Spirit amass radioactive material  to work on the tumors of your heart. See, why do I say tumors? Sin is a tumor, you know, cancer, what is cancer? Cancer is just cell growth gone bad, so it's going to kill you. And what is sin?

It's self-centeredness, self-absorption, self-concentration. It's going to kill you unless you kill it first. And what is the radioactive isotope that will shrink and kill those tumors before they kill  you? It's what Jesus Christ did on the cross, illuminated by the Holy Spirit. Now there's going to be texts.

There's so diverse, there's every person who has grown in grace and has bit by bit been  changed, has put the death, the self-salvation of the body, the self-salvation of the soul,  and slowly, more and more lived large, lived free, lived loved. Anyone who's been through that, you've got a kind of a secret thread of texts and movies  and passages and biblical texts and sermons and things like that. But over the years, the Holy Spirit grabs hold of because of who you are and where you  are at the time and turns it into a radioactive material which you can get out the rest of  your life and use to shrink those tumors when you know that they're starting to grow back. You know, Kathy and I have got a, you know, for example, Duncan, at the end of last  the Mohicans, the British officer who dies in the fire, arms outstretched, crucify the  save a life of Korra. Does that get to you?

Maybe not to you. But it's part of the radioactive materials that the Holy Spirit's given us. First Corinthians 1, God made the foolish things of the world, use the foolish things of  the world to shame the wise. He uses the weak things of the world to shame the strong, he uses even the lowly and despised  things, even the things that are not to bring to nothing and things that are, so that's  kind of moving to me. Yeah, but for us, this is one of the radioactive parts, this is some of the material that  the Holy Spirit is using to destroy the self-salvation.

You can find it anywhere. At the end of the Iron Giant, the Great Cartoon, the Iron Giant, he takes a nuke to save  the people, and it gets resurrected to some incredible music, you see. I can't, Kathy and I can't watch that without weeping about Jesus, and you might say, you  know, T. But let me really show you how it works. At the end of the tale of two cities, Sidney Carton resembles Charles Darnay.

Charles Darnay is in the Bastille, I guess, and he's been sentenced to death, he's condemned,  and he's going to be guillotined, right? Sidney Carton breaks in stealthily to the jail. Knox Charles Darnay out, and some of his companions take the unconscious man and unconscious  man and steal him out of the jail, and Sidney Carton takes his place, takes his clothes,  and waits to die in his place. And the next day, there's a young girl, a young woman who's also been condemned to die,  and she comes up thinking he's Charles Darnay begins to talk, but then realizes it's not  sees his face and realizes it's not, and her eyes get really big. And she says, are you dying for him?

And he says, yes. See that begins to shrink my tumors. The old King James Bible, in verse 13, said, you must mortify the deeds of the flesh. You must mortify your false saviors, and you will live. Of course today, that word mortification just means embarrassed, so we don't use the word  anymore.

In the old days, it meant to put something in the mortuary, but you know what? When I hear Sidney Carton say, yes, I'm dying for him. It shrinks my tumors. It mortifies my stupid, egocentric heart that's always worried about what I'm getting here  and what I'm getting there. And if somebody is noticing me and might get it, it mortifies with joy.

The joy of what Jesus Christ has done for me, it mortifies my ego into silence, so it's  not bothering me as much. And it's not bothering you as much. Are you dying for him? And he says, yes, for him and his wife. And then she takes hold of his hand and says, stranger, it's going to be hard for me to die.

But if I could hold the hand of someone so brave and so courageous and loving as you,  I think I can face it. And he says, all right. She was smitten by the wonder of his substitutionary sacrifice for somebody else. How much more when Holy Spirit shows you what Jesus Christ has done for you? Will you be able to put the death of things that are putting you to death?

Let us pray. Thank you, Father, for giving us a method, a power, and a freedom to really change. We ask that you would help us now to get some more spiritually radioactive material for  the things in our hearts that are harming us and the people around us. We're going to the Lord's table. And we pray that you would be real to us by the power of the Spirit.

To change us into your own image, we ask it in Jesus' name, amen.

今天,提姆·凯勒探讨了在基督徒生命中真正的改变是如何发生的,以及为什么福音提供了一个与其他任何事物都截然不同的转变过程。今晚的圣经经文在公告栏的第9页,是罗马书8章1-13节。如今,那些在基督耶稣里的人就不被定罪了。因为赐生命之灵的律在基督耶稣里释放了你,使你脱离罪和死的律了。律法既因肉体软弱,有所不能行的,神就差遣自己的儿子成为罪身的形状,为了罪,在肉体中定了罪案。

使律法的要求在我们这不随从肉体、只随从圣灵而行的人身上得以成就。因为随从肉体的人,思念肉体的事;随从圣灵的人,思念圣灵的事。体贴肉体就是死,体贴圣灵乃是生命平安。因为体贴肉体就是与神为仇,因为它不服神的律法,也是不能服。而且在肉体中的人不能讨神的喜悦。

然而,你们不是在肉体里,而是在圣灵里。如果神的灵住在你们里面,若有人没有基督的灵,他就不是属基督的。但基督若在你们里面,身体虽然因罪而死,灵却因义而活。如果那叫耶稣从死里复活者的灵住在你们里面,那叫基督耶稣从死里复活的,也必藉着住在你们里面的圣灵,使你们必死的身体又活过来。所以,弟兄们,我们是欠债的人,不是欠肉体的债去顺从肉体而活。

因为你们若顺从肉体活着,必要死;若靠着圣灵治死身体的恶行,就必活着。这是神的话语。我想我每周都说,当我第一次接受基督信仰时,我生命中有很多地方迫切需要改变,但似乎什么都不奏效,直到一些作家,一些基督教作家,带我去看罗马书第6、7、8章,当我开始理解罗马书6、7、8章的教导时,我的生命开始改变。所以在这个简短的系列中,我带你们来看罗马书6、7、8章。

问题是,基督,对基督的信仰如何真正带来一个人生命的真实改变?今天我们来到罗马书第8章,我们看到在耶稣里我们得到三样东西,对于这个主题非常相关的三样东西。我们得到一个新的自由去认识自己,让我用第二人称来说。我们得到一个新的自由,你得到一个新的自由去认识自己。你得到一个新的方法去改变自己,你得到一个新的能力去做自己。

你得到一个新的自由去认识、改变的方法、做自己的能力,第一点。认识自己的新自由,罗马书第7章,我们上周看过,一直到第1节,就是罗马书第8章第1节,一直到第7章末尾的第22、23、24节,是在说这个:在我们每个人里面,都有一个黑暗的团块,即使是我们中最好的人,即使是使徒保罗,都有一个自我吸收、自我专注、自我中心的黑暗团块。这比我们任何人愿意承认的都要糟糕得多,它使我们能够犯下可怕的罪和邪恶。然后,在说完这些之后,保罗说这对你是真的,对我是真的,对我们所有人都是真的,他说完这句话的那一刻,他就转向第8章第1节。

他说,同时,如今那些在基督耶稣里的人就不被定罪了。不被定罪,这个词"定罪"是希腊词kata kreena,意思是有审判反对你,被定罪或有罪意味着有东西在反对你,你要为某事负责,你处于一种疏远的状态,直到你偿还你的债务,比如说对社会的债务。但这是在说,虽然我们不仅能够做错事,而且我们正在做错事,但在同一时刻,关于神,我们所做过的任何事都不会使我们被定罪。关于神,没有责任。而这个词"不",如今不被定罪。

这个词"不"太强了,无法用任何一个特定的英语词来传达,因为它不是一个意味着暂时不被定罪的词。这个词"不"的意思是,对基督徒来说不再有定罪,不再存在。它已被摧毁,永远不会再有,这就是它所说的。所以罗马书第7章只是在说我们能够做出极大的邪恶,紧接着同时说,如果你在基督里,这一切都不能使你在神面前被定罪。这是惊人的,也是独特的。

在路加福音11章有一处,耶稣正在对他的门徒说话,他实际上正在教他们祷告,他这样说,路加福音11章,他对门徒说,你们虽然不好,尚且知道拿好东西给儿女,何况天父,你们这些邪恶的人,不,想想这个。他在对他所爱的人说话,他以他们为乐,他将为他们而死,他无条件地委身于他们,但他也在说,你能听到耶稣对你这样说吗?我爱你。我永远不会离弃你。我无条件地委身于你。

我以你为乐,但你是邪恶的,你知道吗?你听到过这个吗?因为如果你听到过,你就拥有了一些东西,据我所知,没有思想体系,没有哲学,没有宗教,无论东方、西方、个人主义、集体主义、自由派、保守派都能给你的东西。你知道,有一种自由派的心态,从不称任何人包括你自己为有罪或邪恶的,因为你认为所有问题实际上都是心理或社会动态的功能,当你真的做了某件远比你想象中自己能做的更残忍或更懦弱或更糟糕的事情时,你没有类别来容纳它,你会陷入否认。但也有一种保守派的心态,有一种保守派的心态确实对那边的人使用"有罪"和"邪恶"这样的词,他们的身份认同就建立在这样的观念上:我不是他们中的一员。

我是有美德的人之一。我不像那些相对主义者、那些无政府主义者,我是有美德的人之一。当你发现自己,你会的,做出比你做过的任何事都更残忍、更懦弱的事情时,你不会有类别来容纳它,你不会知道如何处理它,你会陷入否认。但是耶稣的福音,耶稣的态度,耶稣的陈述,如果你在基督里,你既是邪恶的又被绝对地爱着,给了我们一种自由,当你说,这很疯狂,这是矛盾的,是的,是的,这很疯狂,诚然,这真的很奇怪。但让我向你展示它有多伟大。

因为首先,它给你一种无与伦比的、独特的社会学自由。我的意思是,你不必再划分,如果你理解这一点,你就不能再把世界划分为好人和坏人。有些人说有好人,然后有自由派。有些人说有好人,然后有原教旨主义者。每个人都在说有好人和坏人,但如果你是基督徒,如果你对此有任何理解,你知道,你知道你和妓女之间的区别,你和杀人犯之间的区别,你和纳粹之间的区别。

你和他们之间唯一的区别是,你心中使你能够成为那样或做那样事的种子只是从未被浇灌,所以它们从未发芽。因此你有自由,在基督里我们有自由,与任何人找到共同的人性,我们感受到我们共同的脆弱人性,我们不抛弃人,我们不称那些人为"那些人",带着大写字母O的"他者",但更重要的是,福音也给你心理自由,来处理你将要做的事情,然后你就不必否认或扭曲它们或压抑它们,使你无法知道自己是谁,因为我不相信有任何其他的,只有在那种支持下,说,看,你能够做可怕的事情,而自从耶稣以来,我绝对无条件地委身于你。如果你有那种支持,你才真正能够诚实?哦,你说,这种称自己为罪人的想法,在情感上是不健康的,你说,哦不,哦不,不能称自己为罪人才是情感上不健康的。我能给你一个例子吗?

一个真实的故事深刻地影响了凯茜和我对此的理解,那是几年前,当我们在弗吉尼亚州时,在我们的地区,这些不是我们个人认识的人,在我们的地区,70年代末一对年轻夫妇发生了一件可怕的事情。他们有三个孩子,被绑在一辆汽车里,汽车最后在没有任何司机的情况下开走了。汽车开进了一个湖或池塘,三个孩子都死了。他们都淹死了,可怕的悲剧。但在葬礼上,这对夫妇出乎所有人意料地真正见证了他们对神的信仰,他们似乎在灵性上如此强大,以至于周围几英里内的每个人都在谈论他们是多么令人难以置信的忠实、优秀的基督徒,对神有多么大的信心,他们确实如此。

他们振作起来,又有了更多的孩子,建立了新的家庭,当然,他们是教会的柱石,丈夫是教会的执事,他是教会的柱石,20年后,我们在另一个教会,我们听到一位牧师讲述一个男人的故事,尽管他正确地没有使用那个人的名字,但对我们来说非常非常清楚,很明显,这是同一个人,那个父亲。他谈到这个人经历了难以置信的苦难,失去了所有三个孩子,他是这个社区的柱石,是他教会的柱石,但许多年后,他来找牧师,极度痛苦,因为他发现,他发现自己对教会里一个不是他妻子的女人有非常强烈的性吸引力,他有非常强烈的感觉,非常强烈的吸引力,他在挣扎,他在痛苦中,他经历了可怕的罪疚感,他,教会的柱石,教会的执事,他怎么能有这种感觉,他怎么能做这样的事,他怎么能想要这个?牧师说这个故事是,他得到了很多咨询,他得到了好的咨询,得到了专业咨询,得到了属灵咨询,但最后,他自杀了。这只是一个悲伤的故事吗?哦,是的,当然这是一个悲伤的故事,但请听我说。

这是一个可以处理世界能给他的最糟糕痛苦的人,但无法处理他可能是一个罪人这一可能性。你还要告诉我能够称自己为罪人在情感上是不健康的吗?对他来说,这绝对是情感不健康的反面。能够说,我能够做可怕的事情,但我被无条件地爱着,是心理健康的缩影。是福音给了我们这个。

福音给你自由,当信息来临时承认你是谁。看到你确实需要改变的地方,认识自己的自由,第一点,第二点。我们在这里学到的第二件事是,福音给你一个新的改变方法,一个方法。在第3节,对罗马书第7章的一个主题进行了另一次重申。它说,律法既因肉体软弱,有所不能行的,神就做成了。

记住,我们上周谈到了这个,保罗在罗马书第7章提出的要点之一是,我们里面有所有这些自我中心、这种自我吸收和这种自我专注。我们里面有这个团块,用这种自我专注使我们自己的生活痛苦。它使我们周围的人的生活痛苦。我们要怎么办?我们通常做的是我们运用意志力,我们看到道德律,我们说我们要遵守道德律。

保罗在这里指出,他总结了他在罗马书第7章所说的,那对你没有帮助,因为你知道自我中心和自以为义可以采取道德形式,也可以采取不道德形式。你可以既是法利赛人又是罪犯,仍然把世界搞得一团糟。那么我们应该怎么做才能改变自己?答案在第13节,就在这里,因为你们若顺从肉体活着,必要死;若靠着圣灵治死身体的恶行,就必活着。若靠着圣灵治死身体的恶行,就必活着。

现在在罗马书第6章和罗马书第7章,恐怕要从释经上证明这一点,你必须回到那些讲道,我不能在这里重述,但在罗马书第6和第7章中我们了解到,当保罗谈到肉体时,他不是在谈论物质身体。当保罗谈到身体的恶行或肉体的恶行时,他谈的是整个生命被一个自我拯救计划所控制,保罗所说的在肉体中生活意味着做你自己的救主,做你自己的主,试图不让神做你的救主和主,你生命中的一切,你身体所做的一切,你整个生命所做的一切,你生命中的一切,你所有的行动和态度以及一切都被一个努力做你自己的救主和主的尝试所控制。这是一个自我拯救计划,这就是按肉体生活和在肉体中生活的意思。他在第13节所说的很有意思。他说,你们若顺从肉体活着,必要死;但你若根除并摧毁你试图拯救自己的特定方式,如果你根除并摧毁你做自我拯救的特定方式,那时而且只有那时你才会活着,你会说,这是怎么运作的?

如果你只是随波逐流,你就会死。如果你按照自我拯救计划生活,你就会死。但如果你识别并摧毁你做自我拯救的特定方式,那时而且只有那时你才会活着,你会说,这是怎么运作的?这个新方法是什么?新方法的核心,第5和第6节说,是识别和改变你所思念的。

还没有改变你所思念的。看第4和第5节。这只是第13节的另一个陈述。他说,因为随从肉体的人,看,思念肉体的事;随从圣灵的人思念圣灵的事。体贴肉体就是死,体贴圣灵乃是生命,哇,和平安。

现在如果你必须记住这一点,解开这个。首先,在圣经中,心思和心灵不是两个不同的东西。是的,在英语中,在我们的思维方式中,心思意味着理性和认知,心灵意味着情感,但在圣经中不是这样。心思和心灵是存在的核心。因此,当保罗说,你思念肉体的事,他不只是说,你有不好的想法。

他甚至不只是在谈论想法。他是这样说的。他要你审视自己,认识到什么占据了你。什么最让你全神贯注。你的心最专注于什么?

你的梦想在哪里?它们存在于哪里?什么抓住了你的想象力?什么最占据和吸引你的思想核心、你的梦想、你的幻想、你的心和你的思想,因为,保罗说,无论那是什么,总是你证明自己正当的方式,你证明自己的方式,你发展自己价值感和自我价值的方式,因此,那是你做自己的救主和主的方式。你说,请你详细说明一下,好的。

诗篇可以深刻地塑造你接近神的方式,即使耶稣也依靠诗篇来面对每一种情况,包括死亡。在提姆和凯茜·凯勒的365天灵修书《耶稣的诗歌》中,你会发现每日阅读诗篇并有新的圣经洞见。如果你没有定期的灵修习惯,这本书是一个很好的开始方式,如果你已经花时间学习和祷告,那么阅读和祷告诗篇可以帮助你把最深的情感和问题带到神面前,发现与祂新的亲密层次。我们会把提姆和凯茜·凯勒的灵修书送给你,作为对你的礼物的感谢,帮助"福音与生活"与更多人分享耶稣的爱。我最近才意识到,我的意思是,我刚刚惊讶地发现,1981年电影《烈火战车》上映时,讲述了两个英国人哈罗德·亚伯拉罕斯和埃里克·利德尔的真实故事,他们在1924年巴黎奥运会上为英国赢得了金牌。

我没有意识到,当那部电影在1981年上映时,珍妮·利德尔,埃里克·利德尔的姐姐还活着。埃里克·利德尔后来成为了在中国的传教士,在二战期间死于中国的拘留营。但珍妮,她在电影中也有描绘,活到了电影上映之后接受采访的时候,她说的一件事是,有一件事让她有点困扰,就是电影中只有一个场景一瞥这个,如果你看过这部电影,你知道是哪一个。但她说电影没有展示的是,每次,每当埃里克,她的哥哥,他是世界级的短跑运动员,百码冲刺,等等,每当埃里克跑步时,他总是脸朝天空,嘴巴张得大大的,看起来像个疯子。他总是脸朝天空跑,直视前方,嘴巴张开。

他看起来很疯狂,他看起来很古怪,但他在敬拜。因为哈罗德·亚伯拉罕斯和埃里克·利德尔都把他们的心思放在同一件事上。他们想跑步,他们想赢,他们想跑步并赢得比赛。但原因完全不同。因为当哈罗德·亚伯拉罕斯被问到,你为什么跑步?

他描述百码冲刺,他说,当那枪声响起时,我有十秒钟,他说,引用原话,证明我的存在。他的意思是,只有当我能赢得这场比赛,如果我能成为一个有成就的运动员,我才知道我很重要,然后我才能面对世界,因为我完成了这件事。但当然,埃里克·利德尔在电影中对珍妮说,珍妮,神让我跑得快。当我跑步时,我感受到祂的喜悦。现在听着,这里有一个人,他跑步是为了赞美他的救主,这里有另一个人,他跑步是为了成为他自己的救主。

他们是这么说的。这里有一个人,他跑步纯粹是为了快乐。这是锦上添花。如果他赢了很好,如果他没赢也很好,因为他已经被证明是正当的了。他的生命被证明是正当的。

这里有另一个人,他在磨人的焦虑中跑步,在焦虑和恐惧中碾磨,因为他在寻求被证明是正当的。他是这么说的。顺便说一句,正如你所知,在电影中,即使在他赢了之后,他发现这并不令人满意,因为偶像从不交付。现在你开始理解,思念肉体的事不只是有不好的想法。它本质上是把你的心思和你的心放在耶稣基督之外的某物上作为功能性的救主。

为了看到这实际上是如何运作的,让我再给你另一种例子。我记得几年前,很多年前,同时咨询两个年轻人。他们两个人都刚刚失去了工作,因为他们的老板相当愚蠢、错误和不公平。因为老板一方的不公平行为,他们都失去了工作,他们的职业记录上都有污点。但A先生,基本上克服了它,原谅了老板,继续前进,而且做得很好,以至于他远远补偿了那个小污点,它本质上成了一个非问题。

另一个人无法克服它。他保持非常苦毒,保持极度愤世嫉俗,这影响了他的职业,影响了他的工作,影响了他整个未来的职业道路。我曾经和第二个人坐下来,很多人一直在试图帮助他。有些人试图直接作用于他的情绪,作用于情绪的方式是你说,哦,你知道,你同情并谈论这有多艰难,这有多可怕,你试图帮助这个人,问题是人们对他表现出越多同情,他就越觉得自己的愤怒是正当的,他的自怜越来越多,他变得更糟。其他人试图直接作用于他的意志。

他们说,来吧,振作起来,别让那些混蛋打倒你,就原谅它,克服它,也没有帮助。因为福音,然而,是不同的。因为福音不是直接作用于情绪并说,哦,你知道,神以某种一般的方式爱你,虽然祂确实爱。福音也不是直接作用于意志并说,现在,你必须做正确的事。当然,你确实必须做正确的事。

但福音说,什么在耶稣基督的位置上作为你真正的功能性救恩和救主?你在寻求什么来证明自己是正当的,看看发生了什么,一个人关心他的职业,另一个人关心他的职业。但第二个人看待他的职业的方式,就像哈罗德·亚伯拉罕斯看待跑步一样。他有一种被定罪的感觉,正是通过他的职业他可以证明自己,证明他很重要,他可以完成某事,当职业出了问题,当职业出了问题时,他感到绝对被定罪,他很愤怒,他瘫痪了,因为他身份认同的根基正在崩溃。直到我们能够做这样的分析。

直到他开始理解他把他的心思放在了肉体上,这是他自我拯救的方法,他才开始说,等等,等等。这不只是,我必须原谅那个人,是的。我不能原谅那个人的原因,不只是我必须重新骑上马努力工作。但我必须的原因,我下面真正的问题是耶稣基督之外的某物在作为我的救主运作。在你过度的、无法控制的问题、欲望、态度、情绪下面,总是有某物,总是在那里。

直到你找到它,你不能有生命和平安,直到你找到它,你会发现你生命中的事情正在崩溃,这叫做死亡。所以首先,你在福音中有支持,诚实面对需要改变的东西。然后你在福音中有一个方法来识别你所思念的,这样你就能理解你需要在哪里改变。然后第三个问题是,等等,等等。那个可怜的人现在如何真正扭转局面?

这是正在发生的事情。这个人是一个宣称的基督徒,哦是的他是。但是,他说,看,我从技术上讲,我相信如今那些在基督耶稣里的人就不被定罪了。从技术上讲,我相信我被爱,但这是简单的事实,我应该能够说,宇宙之王爱我。谁在乎我的老板怎么想,但我不能。

因为我老板的想法对我来说比宇宙之王所说的更真实。那只是,你知道,老板说的是在视频上,但宇宙之王说的某种程度上是在音频上。我在头脑上知道,但我不在心里知道,这就是第三件事。你从哪里得到力量来真正做出这种改变?答案实际上在第13节,但也在第5和第6节。

第13节说,你必须治死身体的恶行,你必须摧毁和根除你的肉体生活方式,你的自我拯救计划,靠着圣灵。靠着圣灵。在第5节它说,你不必把你的心思从肉体的事上移开。你必须,你必须摧毁自我拯救计划。怎么做?

通过思念圣灵的事。现在这是什么意思?通过思念圣灵的事。看,这是我们远离纯技术的地方。现在我们不是完全在控制中,各位。

你不能像拿起剪刀或螺丝刀一样拿起圣灵并开始使用圣灵。但这是它所说的。思念圣灵的事是什么意思?别忘了,思念不只是思考,记得吗?思念圣灵的事意味着你的整个心、思想和存在都被某物迷住了,被俘获了。

看,它们都被聚集在一起,它们全神贯注于,它们被某物占据。你的想象力被某物俘获,什么?在约翰福音14、15和16章,耶稣说,当圣灵来的时候,祂会拿我告诉你们的事,祂会拿我的教导,祂会向你们显明它们。现在就是这样。你可能有这些教导,它们可能在一张纸上,你可能说没关系,但圣灵的工作是让它们对你变得真实。

圣灵的工作是用耶稣基督的美丽和祂所做的事击打你,直到你哭泣,硬币开始掉落。祂对你说的话比你老板对你说的或任何人对你说的都更真实。有一个很棒的地方,约翰·多恩在他的一首十四行诗中说,仔细听,这是非常非常令人惊叹的语言。他在对耶稣说话,他说,把我带到你那里,囚禁我,因为我接受你并投降于我,我永远不会自由,也不会贞洁,除非你征服我。我永远不会贞洁,我永远不会有自制力。

他真正想说的是,这个人或那个人的爱对我的灵魂来说远比你的爱真实。我能够有自制力的唯一方式,我能够原谅我老板的唯一方式,我不担心金钱的唯一方式,我能够处理我在生活中受到的拒绝的唯一方式,我能够大规模地走过生活的唯一方式。看,不让这一切把我拉下来,是我需要圣灵的事工让耶稣基督为我所做的事变得如此真实,以至于我因它的美丽而哭泣,硬币掉落,我就出发了。那替代了我试图推到我存在核心的那些其他东西。这就是它。

这就是改变。你说,那是怎么发生的?嗯,神在这里给了我们一个想法。保罗在第3节给了一个想法。它说,律法既因肉体软弱,有所不能行的,神就做成了。

看,藉着差遣祂的儿子成为罪身的形状,为了罪,祂定了罪案。现在,这个小词"为了罪",天哪,我知道它在页面上看起来如此无害,但所有专家、评论员和学者都明白,这是整个旧约、七十士译本中关于赎罪祭的技术术语。这是它所说的。仅仅说,哦,你需要知道神以一般的方式爱你是不够的。你必须把你的心思放在什么上?

你必须让圣灵向你展示什么?耶稣基督如何在你的位置上被定罪。现在耶稣基督牺牲地献上自己,在你的位置上被定罪。你所做的,你首先学习那个,你学习那个。那是福音的核心。

然后你用余生让圣灵积累放射性物质来作用于你心中的肿瘤。看,我为什么说肿瘤?罪是一个肿瘤,你知道,癌症,癌症是什么?癌症只是细胞生长出了问题,所以它会杀死你。罪是什么?

它是自我中心、自我吸收、自我专注。它会杀死你,除非你先杀死它。什么是放射性同位素,会缩小并杀死那些肿瘤,在它们杀死你之前?是耶稣基督在十字架上所做的,被圣灵光照。现在会有经文。

有如此多样化,每个在恩典中成长并一点一点被改变的人,都治死了肉体的自我拯救,身体的自我拯救,灵魂的自我拯救,慢慢地,越来越多地活得宽广,活得自由,活得被爱。任何经历过这个的人,你都有一种秘密的经文和电影和段落和圣经经文和讲道以及诸如此类的东西的线索。但多年来,圣灵抓住,因为你是谁以及你在那时在哪里,并把它变成放射性物质,你可以在你余生中拿出来,用来缩小那些你知道正在重新生长的肿瘤。你知道,凯茜和我有,你知道,例如,邓肯,在《最后的莫希干人》结尾,那个在火中死去的英国军官,双臂张开,钉十字架拯救科拉的生命。那触动你吗?

也许对你没有。但这是圣灵给我们的部分放射性物质。哥林多前书1章,神拣选了世上愚拙的,用世上愚拙的使智慧人羞愧。祂用世上软弱的使强壮的羞愧,祂甚至用世上卑贱的和被人藐视的,用那无有的,废掉那有的,所以那对我很感动。是的,但对我们来说,这是放射性部分之一,这是圣灵用来摧毁自我拯救的一些物质。

你可以在任何地方找到它。在《钢铁巨人》的结尾,伟大的卡通片,钢铁巨人,他带着核弹拯救人民,然后在一些令人难以置信的音乐中复活,你看。我不能,凯茜和我不能看那个而不为耶稣哭泣,你可能会说,你知道,T。但让我真正向你展示它是如何运作的。在《双城记》的结尾,西德尼·卡顿长得像查尔斯·达内。

查尔斯·达内在巴士底狱,我想,他被判处死刑,他被定罪了,他将被guillotine,对吗?西德尼·卡顿秘密地闯入监狱。打晕查尔斯·达内,他的一些同伴带着这个无意识的人,无意识的人,偷偷把他带出监狱,西德尼·卡顿取代了他的位置,穿上他的衣服,等待代替他而死。第二天,有一个年轻女孩,一个年轻女人,她也被判处死刑,她走上来以为他是查尔斯·达内开始说话,但后来意识到不是,看到他的脸,意识到不是,她的眼睛睁得很大。她说,你要为他而死吗?

他说,是的。看,那开始缩小我的肿瘤。旧钦定版圣经,在第13节,说,你必须治死肉体的恶行。你必须治死你的假救主,你就会活着。当然今天,那个词"治死"只意味着尴尬,所以我们不再使用这个词了。

在过去,它意味着把某物放进太平间,但你知道吗?当我听到西德尼·卡顿说,是的,我要为他而死。它缩小我的肿瘤。它用喜乐治死我愚蠢的、自我中心的心,它总是担心我在这里得到什么,在那里得到什么。如果有人注意到我并且可能得到它,它用喜乐治死,

耶稣基督为我所做的事的喜乐,它让我的自我陷入沉默,所以它不再那么困扰我了。它也不再那么困扰你了。你要为他而死吗?他说,是的,为他和他的妻子。然后她握住他的手说,陌生人,对我来说死会很难。

但如果我能握住像你这样勇敢、勇敢和充满爱的人的手,我想我可以面对它。他说,好的。她被他为别人所做的替代性牺牲的奇迹所震撼。当圣灵向你展示耶稣基督为你所做的事时,会多得多?你会能够治死那些正在让你死亡的事情吗?

让我们祷告。父啊,感谢你给我们一个方法、一个能力和一个自由来真正改变。我们请求你现在帮助我们获得一些更多的属灵放射性物质,来对付我们心中正在伤害我们和我们周围人的东西。我们要去主的桌子。我们祷告你藉着圣灵的能力对我们变得真实。

把我们改变成你自己的形象,我们奉耶稣的名求,阿们。

今天，提姆·凯勒探讨基督徒生命中持久改变是如何真正发生的，以及为什么福音提供了一个与其他任何方式都截然不同的转化过程。今晚的经文选读在公告栏第9页，是罗马书8章1-13节。如今那些在基督耶稣里的人就不被定罪了。因为赐生命之灵的律，在基督耶稣里释放了你，使你脱离罪和死的律。律法既因肉体软弱，有所不能行的，神就差遣自己的儿子，成为罪身的形状，为了对付罪，在肉体中定了罪案。

祂差遣自己的儿子成为有罪肉身的样式，为了罪的缘故，就在肉体中定了罪案，使律法的义成就在我们这不随从肉体、只随从圣灵的人身上。因为随从肉体的人体贴肉体的事，随从圣灵的人体贴圣灵的事。体贴肉体的就是死，体贴圣灵的乃是生命平安。原来体贴肉体的，就是与神为仇，因为不服神的律法，也是不能服。而且属肉体的人不能得神的喜悦。

然而你们不属肉体，乃属圣灵了。如果神的灵住在你们心里，人若没有基督的灵，就不是属基督的。基督若在你们心里，身体就因罪而死，心灵却因义而活。然而叫耶稣从死里复活者的灵，若住在你们心里，那叫基督耶稣从死里复活的，也必藉着住在你们心里的圣灵，使你们必死的身体又活过来。弟兄们，这样看来，我们并不是欠肉体的债，去顺从肉体活着。

你们若顺从肉体活着，必要死；若靠着圣灵治死身体的恶行，必要活着。这是神的话语。我想我每周都说过，当我第一次接受基督信仰时，我生命中有许多方面迫切需要改变，但似乎什么都不起作用，直到一些作家，一些基督教作家，带我看罗马书第6、7、8章，当我开始理解罗马书第6章的教导时，

7章和8章，我的生命开始改变。所以在这个简短的系列中，我带你们来到罗马书第6、7和8章。

问题是，基督，对基督的信仰，实际上如何导致一个人的生命发生真正的改变？今天我们来到罗马书第8章，我们看到在耶稣里我们得到三样东西，与这个主题非常相关的三样东西。我们得到一种新的自由来认识自己，让我用第二人称来说。我们得到一种新的自由，你得到一种新的自由来认识你自己。你得到一种新的方法来改变你自己，你得到一种新的能力来成为你自己。

你得到一种新的自由来认识、方法来改变、能力来成为你自己，第一点。认识你自己的新自由，罗马书第7章，我们上周看的，一直到第1节，也就是罗马书第8章第1节，一直到第7章的第22、23、24节末尾，在说这个：在我们每个人里面，都有一团黑暗的东西，即使是我们中间最好的人，即使是圣保罗，都有一团黑暗的自我专注、自我集中、自我中心。而且远比我们任何人愿意承认的要糟糕得多，它使我们有能力犯下可怕的罪和恶。然后紧接着说了这话之后，保罗说这对你是真的，对我是真的，对我们所有人都是真的，他说完这话的那一刻，他就转向第8章第1节。

他说，与此同时，如今那些在基督耶稣里的人就不被定罪了。不被定罪，定罪这个词是希腊语kata kreena，意思是有一个审判反对你，被定罪或有罪意味着有某样东西反对你，你要为某事负责，你处在一种疏离的状态，直到你偿还你的债，比如说对社会的债。但这是在说，虽然我们不仅有能力做错事，而且在同一时刻对神做错事，但我们所做过的一切都不会使我们陷入定罪。对于神来说，没有责任。这个词"不"，因此如今不被定罪。

这个词"不"太强烈了，无法用任何一个特定的英语词来传达，因为它不是一个意味着暂时没有定罪的词。这个词"不"的意思是，对基督徒来说不再有定罪，没有

不再存在了。它已经被摧毁了，永远不会再有了，这就是它所说的。所以罗马书第7章只是在说我们有能力做出极其邪恶的事，同时又立刻说，如果你在基督里，这一切都永远不能让你在神面前受到定罪。这是令人震惊的，也是独一无二的。

在路加福音第11章有一处，耶稣对他的门徒说话，他实际上在教导他们祷告，他这样说，路加福音第11章，他对门徒说，你们虽然不好，尚且知道拿好东西给儿女，何况你们的天父，你们这些不好的人，不，想想这个。他在对他所爱的人说话，他所喜悦的人，他将要为之而死的人，他无条件委身的人，但他也在说，嗯，你能听到耶稣这样对你说吗？我爱你。我永远不会离弃你。我无条件地委身于你。

我以你为乐，但你是邪恶的，你知道吗？你听过这话吗？因为如果你听过，你就拥有了一些东西，据我所知，没有任何思想体系、哲学、宗教，无论东方、西方、个人主义、集体主义、自由派、保守派，能给你的。你知道，有一种自由派思维方式，从不称任何人包括你自己为有罪或邪恶的，因为你认为所有问题实际上都是心理或社会动力的功能，当你真的做了某件事，比你想象中自己能做的任何事都更残忍或更懦弱或更糟糕时，你没有范畴来理解它，你会进入否认状态。但也有一种保守派思维方式，有一种保守派思维方式，会对那边的人使用"有罪"和"邪恶"这些词，其自我认同的基础就是"我不是他们中的一员"。

我是那些有美德的人之一。我不像那些相对主义者、那些无政府主义者，我是有美德的人之一。当你发现自己，你会的，做出比你曾经做过的任何事都更残忍、更懦弱的事情时，你不会有范畴来理解它，你不知道如何处理它，你会进入否认状态。但耶稣的福音，耶稣的态度，耶稣的声明，如果你在基督里，你就是

同时既是邪恶的又被完全爱着，这给了我们一种自由，当你说，嗯，这太疯狂了，这是矛盾的，是的，是的，这很疯狂，诚然，这真的很奇怪。但让我向你展示这有多么美好。

因为首先，它给了你一种无与伦比的、独特的社会学自由。我的意思是，你不必再把世界分成好人和坏人。有些人说有好人，然后有自由派。有些人说有好人，然后有原教旨主义者。每个人都在说有好的和坏的，但如果你是一个基督徒，如果你对此有任何理解，你知道，你知道你和一个妓女、你和一个杀人犯、你和一个纳粹分子之间的区别。

你和他们之间唯一的区别是，在你心中那些使你有能力成为或做那样事情的种子只是从未被浇灌，所以它们从未发芽。因此你拥有自由，在基督里我们拥有自由，能够与任何人找到共同的人性，我们感受到我们共同的脆弱人性，我们不会把人一笔勾销，我们不会称呼人们为"那些人"，用大写O的"他者"，而且更重要的是，福音给了你心理上的自由，去处理那些你将要做的事情，然后你不必否认或曲解它们或压抑它们，使你无法知道自己是谁，因为我不相信还有任何其他，只有当你得到这样的支持，说，看，你能做出可怕的事情，而自从耶稣以来我无条件地完全委身于你。如果你得到这样的支持，你才真正能够诚实。哦，你说，这种称自己为罪人的想法，这在情感上是不健康的，你说，哦不，哦不，在情感上不健康的是不能称自己为罪人。我能给你举个例子吗？

一个真实的故事，真正影响了凯西和我对此的理解，那是多年前，当我们在弗吉尼亚的时候，在我们的地区，这些不是我们personally认识的人，在我们的地区，一件可怕的事情发生在70年代末，发生在一对年轻的已婚夫妇身上。他们有三个孩子，他们

被绑在一辆汽车里，那辆汽车最后在没有任何司机的情况下开了进去。汽车掉进了一个湖或池塘，三个孩子全部丧生。他们都淹死了，可怕的悲剧。但在葬礼上，这对夫妇出乎所有人意料地真实见证了他们对上帝的信心，他们看起来在属灵上如此不可思议地坚强，以至于方圆几英里的每个人都在谈论他们是多么令人难以置信地忠信、良善的基督徒，多么有对上帝的信心，他们确实如此。

他们振作起来，又生了更多的孩子，建立了一个新家庭，当然，他们是教会的支柱，丈夫是教会的执事，他是教会的支柱。20年后，我们在另一个教会，听到一位牧师讲了一个关于一个人的故事，尽管他理所当然地没有使用这个人的名字，但对我们来说非常非常清楚，非常明显，这就是同一个人，那位父亲。他谈到这个人经历了难以置信的苦难，失去了三个孩子，他是这个社区的支柱，是他教会的支柱，但他们许多年后来找牧师，处于绝对的痛苦之中，因为他发现，他发现自己非常强烈地被教会里一个不是他妻子的女人吸引，他有非常强烈的感觉，非常强烈的吸引力，他在挣扎，他在痛苦中，他经历了可怕的内疚，他，这个教会的支柱，教会的执事，他怎么能有这种感觉，他怎么能做这样的事，他怎么能想要这个？牧师说这个故事是，他接受了大量的咨询，他得到了好的咨询，得到了专业咨询，他得到了属灵咨询，但最终，他自杀了。现在，这只是一个悲伤的故事吗？哦，是的，当然这是一个悲伤的故事，但听我说。

这里有一个人，他能承受世界能给他的最严重的苦难，却无法承受自己可能是个罪人的事实。你还要告诉我，能够称自己为罪人在情感上是不健康的吗？对他来说，这绝对是情感上的相反

盘式健康，不健康。能够说，我有能力做可怕的事情，但我被无条件地爱着，这是心理健康的缩影。而正是福音给了我们这一切。

福音给你自由，让你在信息到来时承认自己是谁。看到你确实需要改变的地方，认识自己的自由，第一点，第二点。我们在这里学到的第二件事是福音给你一个改变的新方法，一个方法。在第三节中，这里又重申了罗马书第七章的一个主题。它说，神已经做了律法因肉体软弱而不能做的事。

记得，我们上周谈到过这一点，保罗在罗马书第七章中提出的一个观点是，我们都有这种自我中心主义、自我专注和自我集中。我们内心有这样一团东西，它以这种自我专注使我们自己的生活痛苦。它使我们周围的人的生活痛苦。我们该怎么办呢？我们通常所做的就是应用意志力，我们看到道德律法，我们说我们要活出道德律法。

保罗在这里指出，他总结了他在罗马书第七章中所说的，那样做对你没有帮助，因为你知道自我中心和自以为义既可以采取道德的形式，也可以采取不道德的形式。你可以成为法利赛人，也可以成为罪犯，仍然把世界搞得一团糟。那么我们应该怎么做才能改变自己呢？答案在第13节，就在这里，因为你们若顺从肉体活着，必要死；若靠着圣灵治死身体的恶行，必要活着。若靠着圣灵治死身体的恶行，必要活着。

现在在罗马书第六章和第七章中，恐怕要从释经学上证明这一点，你必须回到那些讲道，我不能在这里重述，但在罗马书第六章和第七章中我们了解到，当保罗谈到肉体时，他不是在谈论物质的身体。当保罗谈到身体的恶行或肉体的恶行时，他是在谈论整个生活被一个自我救赎计划所控制，保罗所说的在肉体中生活的意思是成为你自己的救主，成为你自己的

自己的主，试图成为自己的救主和主，而不是让神成为你的救主和主，你生命中的一切，你身体所做的一切，你整个生命所做的一切，你生命中的一切，你所有的行为和态度以及一切都被一种成为自己救主和主的努力所控制。这是一个自我救赎的计划，这就是按肉体生活和活在肉体中的意思。而他在第13节中说的话非常引人深思。他说，如果你按肉体生活，你就会死，但如果你根除和摧毁你试图拯救自己的特定方式，如果你根除和摧毁你进行自我救赎的特定方式，你就会活。

如果你只是随波逐流，你就会死。如果你按自我救赎计划生活，你就会死。但如果你根除、识别并摧毁你进行自我救赎的特定方式，那么也只有那时你才会活，你会说，这怎么运作？这个新方法是什么？在这个新方法的核心，第五节和第六节说，是认识并改变你所思想的。

还没有改变你所思想的东西。看第四节和第五节。这只是第13节的另一种表述。他说，因为那些按肉体生活的人，看，他们的心思放在肉体的事上，但那些按圣灵生活的人把他们的心思放在圣灵的事上。把心思放在肉体上就是死亡，但把心思放在圣灵上就是生命，哇，还有平安。

现在如果你必须记住这一点，解开这个。首先，在圣经中，心思和心灵不是两个不同的东西。是的，在英语中，在我们的思维方式中，心思意味着理性和认知，心灵意味着情感，但在圣经中不是这样。心思和心灵是存在的核心。因此，当保罗说，你把心思放在肉体上，他不只是在说，你有坏的想法。

他甚至不只是在谈论想法。这是他在说的。他要求你审视自己并认识到什么占据了你。什么最让你全神贯注。你的心最沉浸在什么当中？

你的梦想在哪里？它们存在于何处？什么捕获了你的想象力？什么最

占据和吞没你思想和梦想的核心、你的幻想、你的心和你的意念，因为保罗说，无论那是什么，那总是你为自己辩护的方式，你证明自己的方式，你发展自己价值感和自我价值的方式，因此，那就是你成为自己的救主和主的方式。你说，请你具体阐述一下，好的。

诗篇可以深刻地塑造你亲近神的方式，甚至耶稣也依靠诗篇来面对每一个处境，包括死亡。在Tim和Kathy Keller的365天灵修书《耶稣的诗歌》中，你会找到贯穿诗篇的每日读经和全新的圣经洞见。如果你还没有固定的灵修习惯，这本书是一个很好的开始方式，如果你已经花时间学习和祷告，那么阅读和通过诗篇祷告可以帮助你将最深的情感和问题带到神面前，并发现与祂亲密关系的新层次。我们会将Tim和Kathy Keller的灵修书作为对你的礼物，以感谢你的奉献帮助Gospel and Life与更多人分享耶稣的爱。我最近刚刚意识到，我是说，我刚刚惊奇地发现，当1981年电影《烈火战车》制作时，这是一个关于两名英国人Harold Abrams和Eric Liddell的真实故事，他们在1924年巴黎奥运会上为英国赢得金牌。

我不知道当那部电影在1981年上映时，Eric Liddell的妹妹Jenny Liddell还活着。Eric Liddell后来去中国做了传教士，并在二战期间死于中国的拘留营。但Jenny，在电影中也有描绘，活到了电影上映后接受采访的时候，她说的其中一件事是，有一件事让她对电影有点困扰，就是电影中只有一个场景瞥见了这一点，如果你知道这部电影，你就知道是哪一个。但她说，电影没有展现的是，每一次，无论何时Eric，她的哥哥，一位世界级的跑步运动员，短跑选手，百码冲刺等等，每当Eric跑步时，他总是脸朝天空，嘴巴大张着跑，

看起来像个疯子。他总是跑步时脸朝天，嘴巴张开，直接面对着天空。

他看起来很疯狂，看起来很古怪，但他是在敬拜。因为哈罗德·艾布拉姆斯和埃里克·利德尔都把心思放在同一件事上。他们想跑步，他们想赢，他们想跑并赢得比赛。但原因完全不同。因为当有人问哈罗德·艾布拉姆斯，你为什么跑步时？

他描述百码短跑，他说，当那把枪响时，我有十秒钟，他说，原话是，来证明我存在的意义。他的意思是，只有当我能赢得这场比赛，如果我能成为一名出色的运动员，我才知道我很重要，然后我才能面对这个世界，因为我完成了这件事。但当然，埃里克·利德尔在电影中对珍妮说，珍妮，上帝让我跑得快。当我奔跑时，我感受到祂的喜悦。现在听着，这是一个人，他跑步是为了赞美他的救主，而另一个人跑步是为了成为他自己的救主。

他们自己说的。这是一个人，他跑步纯粹是为了享受。这是锦上添花。如果他赢了很好，如果他没赢也很好，因为他已经被称义了。他的生命已经被称义了。

而另一个人跑步时充满了磨人的焦虑，折磨和消耗，焦虑和恐惧，因为他在寻求被称义。他自己说的。顺便说一句，正如你所知道的，在电影中，即使在他赢了之后，他发现这并不令人满意，因为偶像从不兑现承诺。现在你开始明白了，将心思放在肉体上不仅仅是有坏的想法。本质上是把你的心思和心灵放在耶稣基督之外的某些东西上，作为功能性的救主。

为了看清这实际上是如何运作的，让我再给你举另一个例子。我记得多年前，很多年前，同时为两个年轻人提供咨询。他们俩都刚刚失去了工作，因为他们的老板相当愚蠢、错误和不公平。由于老板的不公平行为，他们都失去了工作，而且他们的职业记录上都有了污点。但是A先生，很快就走出来了，原谅了老板，继续前进，并且表现得非常好，以至于他充分弥补了那次

小小的污点，本质上根本不是什么问题。

另一个人却无法释怀。他一直非常苦毒，非常愤世嫉俗，这影响了他的工作，影响了他整个未来的职业道路。我曾经和那第二个人坐下来谈过，很多人都试图帮助他。有些人试图直接针对他的情绪来帮助他，而直接针对情绪的方式是对他表示同情，谈论这件事有多艰难、多可怕，试图帮助他，但问题是人们越是同情他，他就越觉得自己的愤怒是正当的，他的自怜越来越深，情况反而越来越糟。其他人则试图直接针对他的意志。

他们说，振作起来，别让那些混蛋击垮你，原谅吧，放下吧，但这也没有帮助。然而，福音却不同。因为福音不会直接针对情绪说，哦，你知道，神以某种笼统的方式爱你，虽然祂确实爱你。福音也不会直接针对意志说，现在，你必须做正确的事。当然，你确实必须做正确的事。

但福音会说，什么在你生命中占据了耶稣基督的位置，成为你真正实际的救赎和拯救者？你在仰望什么来证明自己的价值？你看，发生的情况是，第一个人关心他的事业，第二个人也关心他的事业。但第二个人看待他的事业，就像哈罗德·亚伯拉罕看待跑步一样。他有一种被定罪的感觉，正是通过他的事业，他可以证明自己，证明自己是重要的，证明自己能成就一些事情。当事业出了问题，他感到自己彻底被定罪了，他既愤怒又瘫痪，因为他身份认同的根基正在崩塌。直到我们能够进行这样的分析，

直到他开始明白他已经把心思定在肉体上，这是他自我拯救的方式，他才开始说，等等，等等。不仅仅是，我

必须原谅那个人，是的。我无法原谅那个人的原因，不仅仅是我必须重新振作起来努力工作。但我必须这样做的原因，我内心真正的问题是有某个东西在取代耶稣基督作为我的救主。在你那些过度的、无法控制的问题、欲望、态度、情绪之下，总是有某个东西存在。

直到你找到它，你无法拥有平安的生活，直到你找到它，你会发现你生命中的事情不断崩塌，那就是所谓的死亡。所以首先，你在福音中得到支持，能够诚实面对需要改变的事情。然后你在福音中得到一个方法，去识别你所关注的事物，这样你就能理解你需要在哪里改变。然后第三个问题是，等等，等等。那个可怜的人现在到底如何真正地转变呢？

事情是这样的。那个人是一个自称的基督徒，哦是的，他是。但是，他说，看，从理论上讲，我相信那些在基督耶稣里的人不被定罪。从理论上讲，我相信我是被爱的，但事实很简单，我应该能够说，宇宙之王爱我。谁在乎我老板怎么想，但我做不到。

因为我老板的想法对我来说比宇宙之王所说的更真实。那只是，你知道，老板说的话就像视频一样，但宇宙之王说的话更像是音频。我用头脑知道，但我不用心知道，这就是第三件事。你从哪里获得力量来真正做出这种改变？答案实际上在第13节，但也在第5节和第6节。

第13节说，你必须治死身体的恶行，你必须摧毁并根除你肉体的生活方式，你的自我救赎计划，要靠着圣灵。靠着圣灵。在第5节说，你不必把你的心思从肉体的事上移开。你必须，你必须摧毁那些自我救赎的计划。怎么做？

通过关注圣灵的事。那么这意味着什么？通过关注圣灵的事。看，这就是我们远离纯粹技巧的地方。现在我们不是完全在控制之中，

各位。

你不能像拿起剪刀或螺丝刀那样拿起圣灵并开始使用圣灵。但这里要说的是，思想属灵的事是什么意思呢？别忘了，思想不仅仅是思考，记得吗？思想属灵的事意味着你的整个心灵、思想和存在都被某件事所迷住、所俘获。

你看，它们都被汇聚在一起，它们全神贯注于、全心专注于、被某件事所捕获。你的想象力被某件事所捕获，是什么呢？在约翰福音第14、15和16章，耶稣说，当圣灵来临时，他会拿起我告诉你们的事，他会拿起我的教导并向你们显明。就是这样。你可能已经有了这些教导，它们可能写在一张纸上，你可能说没问题，但圣灵的工作是要使它们对你变得真实。

圣灵的工作是用耶稣基督的美善和他所成就的事来击打你，直到你哭泣，直到你恍然大悟。他对你所说的比你的老板对你说的、或任何人对你说的都更加真实。约翰·多恩在他的一首十四行诗中有一个很精彩的地方，仔细听，这语言真的很惊人。他对耶稣说话，他说：把我带到你那里，囚禁我，因为除非你拘禁我，我永远不会自由；除非你掠夺我，我永远不会纯洁。我永远不会纯洁，我永远不会有自制力。

他在这里真正想说的是，这个人或那个人的爱对我的灵魂来说会比你的爱更加真实。而我能够拥有自制力的唯一方法，我能够原谅我老板的唯一方法，我能够不为金钱而忧虑的唯一方法，我能够处理生活中所遭遇的拒绝的唯一方法，我能够大步走过人生的唯一方法。你看，要不让这一切把我压垮，我需要圣灵的服事，使耶稣基督为我所做的一切变得如此真实，以至于我因它的美善而哭泣，恍然大悟，然后我就出发了。那会取代我试图推到我存在核心的那些其他东西，取代我试图推到我存在中心的那些东西。

这就是它所做的。

这就是改变。你说，那么这是怎么发生的呢？嗯，神在这里给了我们一个启示。保罗在第三节给出了一个启示。它说，因为神已经借着律法做成了我们凭肉体所不能做的。

看，借着差遣他的儿子成为罪身的样式，并为着罪，他定了罪的罪。现在，"为着罪"这个小词，天哪，我知道它在页面上看起来如此无害，但所有专家、评论家和学者都明白，这在整个旧约和七十士译本中是一个专业术语，指的是赎罪祭。这里说的是什么呢？仅仅说，哦，你只需要知道神笼统地爱你，这还不够。你必须把你的心思集中在什么上？

你必须让圣灵向你显明什么？就是耶稣基督如何在你的位置上被定罪。现在，耶稣基督牺牲了自己，在你的位置上被定罪。而你所做的，你首先研究这一点，你学习这一点。这是福音的核心。

然后你用余生让圣灵积累放射性物质来治疗你心中的肿瘤。看，我为什么说肿瘤？罪就是肿瘤，你知道，癌症，什么是癌症？癌症只是细胞生长出了问题，所以它会杀死你。那么什么是罪呢？

它是自我中心、自我专注、自我集中。它会杀死你，除非你先杀死它。什么是能够缩小并杀死那些肿瘤的放射性同位素，在它们杀死你之前？就是耶稣基督在十字架上所做的，由圣灵所光照的。现在会有一些经文。

那里有如此多样的，每一个在恩典中成长并一点一点被改变的人，已经治死了身体的自我拯救、灵魂的自我拯救，并且慢慢地，越来越多地活得宏大、活得自由、活得被爱。任何经历过这些的人，你都有一种秘密的线索，由经文、电影、段落、圣经经文、讲道和类似的东西组成。但多年来，圣灵会抓住这些，因为你是谁以及你当时所处的位置，并把它变成一种放射性物质，你可以在余生中拿出来使用，用来缩小那些肿瘤，当你知道

它们开始重新生长。你知道，凯西和我有一个，你知道，例如，邓肯，在《最后的莫希干人》结尾，那位英国军官在火中死去，双臂伸展，为了拯救科拉的生命而被钉死。这触动你吗？

也许对你来说不是。但这是圣灵赐给我们的放射性材料的一部分。哥林多前书第一章说，神拣选了世上愚拙的，用世上愚拙的羞辱那智慧的。他用世上软弱的羞辱那强壮的，他甚至使用那些卑贱的和被藐视的，甚至那些不存在的，来废掉那存在的，所以这对我来说是有些感人的。是的，但对我们来说，这是放射性部分之一，这是圣灵用来摧毁自我救赎的一些材料。

你可以在任何地方找到它。在《钢铁巨人》这部伟大的动画片结尾，钢铁巨人承受了核弹来拯救人们，然后在一些令人难以置信的音乐中复活，你看。我和凯西看那个的时候都会为耶稣而哭泣，你可能会说，你知道，T。但让我真正向你展示它是如何运作的。在《双城记》的结尾，西德尼·卡顿和查尔斯·达内长得很像。

查尔斯·达内在巴士底狱里，我想，他被判处死刑，他被定罪了，他将被送上断头台，对吧？西德尼·卡顿偷偷潜入监狱。打昏查尔斯·达内，他的一些同伴带着这个失去知觉的人偷偷将他带出监狱，西德尼·卡顿取代了他的位置，穿上他的衣服，等着代替他去死。第二天，有一个年轻女孩，一个年轻女人也被判处死刑，她走上来以为他是查尔斯·达内开始说话，但后来意识到不是，看到他的脸意识到不是，她的眼睛睁得很大。她说，你要为他而死吗？

他说，是的。看，这开始缩小我的肿瘤。古老的钦定版圣经，在第13节说，你必须治死肉体的行为。你必须治死你虚假的救主，你就会活着。当然今天，mortification这个词只是意味着尴尬，所以我们不再使用这个词

了。

在过去，它意味着把某物放进太平间，但你知道吗？当我听到西德尼·卡顿说，是的，我为他而死。这缩小了我的肿瘤。它以喜乐治死了我那愚蠢的、自我中心的心——那颗总是担心我在这里得到什么、在那里得到什么的心。担心是否有人注意到我，可能会得到它，它用喜乐治死了它。

基督耶稣为我所做的一切所带来的喜乐，它将我的自我治死到沉默，所以它不再那么困扰我了。它也不再那么困扰你了。你愿意为他而死吗？他说，是的，为他和他的妻子而死。然后她握住他的手说，陌生人，对我来说死去会很艰难。

但如果我能握住像你这样勇敢、这样有勇气、这样有爱的人的手，我想我能面对它。他说，好的。她被他为别人做出的替代性牺牲的奇妙所打动。当圣灵向你显明耶稣基督为你所做的一切时，这会更加深刻！你将能够治死那些正在使你死亡的事物吗？

让我们祷告。父啊，感谢你给我们一个方法、一种能力和一种自由来真正改变。我们祈求你现在帮助我们得到更多属灵的放射性物质，来对付我们心中那些伤害我们自己和周围人的事物。我们要来到主的桌前。我们祈求你借着圣灵的大能向我们显现。

使我们变成你自己的形象，我们奉耶稣的名祈求，阿们。
