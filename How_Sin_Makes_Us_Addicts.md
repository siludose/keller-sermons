Welcome to Gospel in Life. Why is the world so broken? And why are we capable of inflicting such harm, even toward those we love? People point to politics, poverty, or psychology, but none of these fully explain what we see  in ourselves and in history. This month on the podcast, Tim Keller is teaching from a series exploring the question,  what's wrong with us?

Knowing us how the Bible's teaching on sin offers the only explanation deep enough  to face the truth in all its complexity, and the only hope, powerful enough to transform  us. Jeremiah 21 to 8 and 23 to 32. It's printed there. This is the beginning and the ending of this great chapter in the book of the Prophet,  Jeremiah. The word of the Lord came to me, go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem, I remember  the devotion of your youth, how as a bride you loved me, and followed me through the desert  through a land not sewn, Israel was holy to the Lord, the first fruits of his harvest,  all who devoured her were held guilty, and disaster overtook them, declares the Lord.

Under the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob, all you clans of the house of Israel, this  is what the Lord says. What fault did your fathers find in me that they strayed so far from me? They followed worthless idols and became worthless themselves. They did not ask, where is the Lord, who brought us up out of Egypt and led us through  the barren wilderness through a land of deserts and rifts, a land of drought and darkness,  a land where no one travels and no one lives? I brought you into a fertile land to eat its fruit and rich produce, but you came into  a file of my land and made my inheritance detestable.

The priest did not ask where is the Lord, those who deal with the law did not know me,  the leaders rebelled against me, and the prophets prophesied by bail following worthless  idols. How can you say, I am not the file, I have not run after the bail, see how you behaved  in the valley, consider what you have done, you are a swift she camel running here and  there, a wild donkey accustomed to the desert, sniffing the wind in her craving, in her  heat who can restrain her, any males that pursue her need not tire themselves at mating  time they will find her. Do not run until your feet are bare and your throat is dry, but you said, it is no use. I love foreign gods, I must go after them. As the thief is disgraced when he is caught, so the house of Israel is disgraced, they  are kings and their officials, their priests and their prophets.

They say to the wood you are my father and to stone you gave me birth, they have turned  their backs on me and not their faces yet when they are in trouble they say, come and save  us. Where then are the gods you made for yourselves? Let them come if they can save you, when you are in trouble, for you have as many gods  as you have towns, O Judah, why do you bring charges against me, you have all rebelled  against me to clear the Lord? In vain I punish your people, they did not respond to correction, your sword has devoured  your prophets like a ravening lion. You of this generation consider the word of the Lord.

Have I been a desert to Israel or a land of great darkness? Why do my people say we are free to roam, we will come to you no more, does a maiden forget  her jewelry or a bride who are wedding ornaments yet my people have forgotten me, days without  number? This is God's word. One of the reasons why we have trouble talking about sin and evil, even though we need  to, where there is things in our past that we feel vaguely guilty for, there is things  that we see people doing to us or out in the world and we feel moral outrage toward  and yet we have been taught by our society that to use the word sin or evil is oppressive  or meaningless, and yet we sense something out there that we don't have the vocabulary  for. Now what we are going to do in this series started last week, we are going to go to the  Bible because the Bible gives us a far more rich vocabulary for sin, it helps us understand  sin in ways that most of us in our society just don't.

It is so much richer, it is so much more nuanced last week, for example, we saw sin is reducing  God and the result is smallness of spirit. This week we are going to see that sin is replacing God and the result is addiction of  spirit. This is a prophecy from Jeremiah to a nation in spiritual decline and what we see here  is he is telling us three things, he is telling us about the dynamics of what we call the  dynamics of spiritual attraction, the dynamics of spiritual addiction and the dynamics of spiritual  restoration. I think as we get near the end you are going to see what I mean by what a different, what  a different, how this enriches our vocabulary when it comes to thinking of sin and evil  and how important that is very practically, but let's get started. First of all he shows us the dynamics of spiritual attraction.

All through here he is using remarkable sexual imagery. One verse which I left out, I was trying to say well I can't print the whole chapter  but we are looking in a sense of the whole chapter and there is one verse that is very  very interesting. See in verse 4-8 which we did print, we are told God is calling them to task for the fact  they are turning to idols, they are worshiping other gods, they are not worshiping him. Verses 1-3 he uses, we will get back to this, remarkable sexual imagery of a young married  couple just hopelessly in love and in the very end we are going to see, but in verse 20 this  is what I didn't print but I should have, in verse 20 there is a verse that starts this  way, it goes this way, on every high hill under every spreading chestnut, every spreading  tree you, now we say okay that is idol worship because we know that on every high hill they  had altars to bail, on under every spreading tree there were altars to bail, why will because  altars were a sign of trans, high hills were a sign of transcendence, spreading trees were  a sign of fertility, so in verse 20 you see the sentence starts like this, on every high  hill and under every spreading tree and you figure the sentence will end, you worship  idols, that's not what it says, what it says is on every high hill and under every spreading  tree you spread your legs, now I don't know what version you've got out there but I can  tell you one thing, whatever English version if you've got a Bible with you you look at it  and I know it doesn't say that, whether it's King James or RSV or the new international  version or whatever version it is it's not going to say that, but that's what it literally  says in the Hebrew, it's interesting, generally speaking, the translators feel that we're just  too sensitive or something, to actually hear what God is trying to tell us, what God says  is that when you worship idols, when you worship other gods, he says on the top of every hill  under every tree you're spreading your legs, now why would he use that kind of imagery, is he  just trying to, you know, get our attention, is he just trying to, you know, is this just  for shock value, no it's for teaching value because this is what he's teaching all through  here, why all the way through the Bible, when God talks about worshiping him, he uses sexual  imagery so often and when he talks about worshiping anything else or worshiping any worship  is used very often under the umbrella of sexual imagery, why would God do that, here's  what he's doing, he is saying that there is an attraction going on at the spiritual level  in your heart right now, every bit is powerful as the sexual attraction at the physical level  they can happen, in other words, right now he's saying there is something going on in your  soul, in the deepest recesses of your soul, you are laying down with something spiritually  you're putting yourself in the arms of something spiritually and you relate, your spiritual  relationship with that thing is every bit is powerful as a physical relationship is and a  sexual one at that, now for a minute think about physical attraction, on the one hand physical  attraction is pretty overwhelming, in fact most of us would probably say that most embarrassing  moments in our lives and most of you only you yourselves know who these are, most embarrassing  moments in our lives where times where a physical attraction kind of overwhelmed are coming  since, overwhelmed are wisdom, overwhelmed are conscience but what makes physical attraction  so strong is it just emotional infatuation, now here's a place where I'm going to turn  to the biologist because actually Jeremiah turns to the biologist, I usually don't, generally I'm  not going to go to a biologist and say tell me about the sexual instinct, I don't usually like  what I hear, in fact you don't either, most people don't, but it's intriguing, Jeremiah  likens us and it's really pretty powerful, likens us to an animal at one point, not just to  a bride like in the very beginning of chapter two and at the very end but here in the very middle  he says see how you behaved in the valley, he were a swift she camel running here and there  a wild donkey a custom to the desert sniffing the wind in her craving in her heat, now here's what  the biologists are going to tell you why is the physical desire, why is sexual desire so important  and it's this collectively speaking we are dead unless we find somebody else, we cannot reproduce  ourselves, this is what the biologists would tell you, the biologists would say that unless you're  Godzilla, this is true of every other species, there's something in the male that only the male  produces, that has to get together with something in the female produces or else your race is over,  your species is over, you're over and therefore the biologists will tell you is a big root of this  incredible physical attraction, is collectively speaking male gender or female gender by itself  is incomplete and it's dead unless you literally get together, that's certainly obviously there's  nothing emotional about animals and yet the physical attraction is incredibly powerful, there's no  emotional involvement we can tell, oh where's it come from, it comes from the fact that we are  biologically speaking we're incomplete collectively okay, now why this powerful sexual imagery,  here's why, this passage, this text is not talking at all about Israel's sexual practices, it's not  talking at all about sexual ethics, it's talking about religion, you know it's very interesting  down on St. Mark's place across from Kim's video there's a story it says religious sex  and it's very attention getting it's sort of avant-garde and cool to call something religious  sex why because in our mind religion and sex are two totally different things they're total  opposites so put it together kind of gets to you right that's why they chose it it's St.

Mark's  place you know we're we're avant-garde we're unusual we're shocking well God beat them to it  Jeremiah did this 2500 years ago and here's what they're saying  there is deep in your soul a spiritual desire even more powerful than the desires that  inform physical attraction and it's this you cannot produce your own meaning in life you cannot by  yourself produce your own worth you cannot produce your own security everybody has got to have  some meaning in life or else life is empty everybody's got to have some affirmation of your worth  or else you feel worthless everybody's got to have some security or you can't face life but you  cannot produce it yourself anymore then you can reproduce your own species your own your own your  own life you can't reproduce that spirituality whether you can reproduce yourself physically all by  yourself you have you can't just say all that matters to me is I like me you're never going  to get your worth that way you can't say I'm just going to live for my own happiness you'll never  get your meaning that way there's got to be something else besides you that is a source of your  meaning the source of your worth the source of your security and you are dry for that you're  need for that you need to take hold of whatever that is that's be something or somebody or some  some person or some pursuit or some relationship or some goal or some condition or some practice  something you are powerless to reproduce to produce in your heart meaning and worth and security  as you are physically able to reproduce reproduce your own life and so spiritually speaking if it's  not God who's the lover of your soul if it's not God in whose arms you are spiritually if it's  not God whose meaning is the source of your meaning whose affirmation is the source of your  self-worth and whose power is the source of security if it's not God you're in bed with something  spiritually something you've given yourself to in realm so deep and so profound that God here  is saying you are as every bit spiritually beholden to it as you are physically beholden you every  bit is spiritually laid out as spread out as vulnerable to it physically as you are physically when  you're having sex with someone you're doing the very same thing spiritually that you do in bed  with someone physically same thing you've got to have this you're spiritually incomplete  and therefore you're in bed with something now let's take a minute before we move on  can I show you how radically different this view is of soul and of spirit than what you're going  to hear about or read about if you go into Barnes and Noble and you go to the section on soul and  spirit it it's getting bigger every year there are just tons of book on soul care of the soul  and help for the soul and chicken soup for the soul or the spirit you know care for the spirit  and if you go in get those books down they're all very very different and yet they're all the same  first of all they depict the soul as a pond a sort of still lake but the Bible depicts the soul as a  restless turbulent ocean or whenever they talk all these books talk about the cure of the soul  or the care of the soul what they usually they talk about getting into quiet places and they  think about it and think inspirational thoughts reflect you see be quiet see the soul is is  that sort of thing and the Bible says something so much more robust so much more robust so much  more vital so much for a lie your soul are your soul is too empty arms your soul is an utterly empty  heart and you must run after things in order to fill that I can't help it says the soul I must run  after them see completely different approach not only to your soul your soul doesn't just need to be  petted there there your soul needs love your soul needs rapture your soul needs passion all right  but it's also giving us a completely different view not just of the soul but it's a completely  different view of God if you take those books down if they ever do talk about God many of them just  don't but if they ever do talk about that God they talk about God in the sense of being  someone who sort of gives peace a sort of a remote a power a force and God here says  I am not just a remote force in fact I am not just a sovereign you obey let me tell you what I  built you for I want to be the lover of your soul I want to be the center of your heart  look he's saying at the sex act look at the greatest rapturous bit of sexual love  that is just a dim hint of what closure between your soul and my soul will be  that's what I've made you for that's what I want you to be with me  you know I mean you know there are a lot of people go in and they think this is great this  approach to the soul the modern new age spirituality and they just say that and it seems so  cool it seems so avant-garde you see it seems so much more it seems much better than the  wooden mechanical understanding people have of Christianity but Christianity real Christianity  look what we're seeing look what we're talking about this view of the soul this view of God  God says I want you my arms power the dynamics of spiritual traction and he says if I'm not if I'm  not in your arms if you're not in my arms you're in your arms with something now the second thing  we learned I'm going to be brief on this because a lot of you know this and what you would rather have  you'd like to know I'm pretty good at telling you what's wrong with you and some of you are going to  say I've heard this part before I'd like to find out what to do about it so let me be brief the  second thing we learn here is also the dynamics of spiritual addiction because what God is saying is  if you don't have me in your arms if you if you're in the arms of anything else you're in deep  trouble you're actually an addiction cycle let me show you how that cycle runs so briefly first  of all the first part of the cycle is you promote something look here in verse 27 they say the  word you are my father and a stone you gave me birth and then you say okay you're my father you  gave me birth now what is some of you're saying okay what do you mean if you're not worshiping God  if he's not the center of your life if he's not the center of your heart if he's not your greatest  joy if you don't have that kind of intimacy with him well I'm turning to other gods well what do you  mean when you think of idolatry and false gods usually think of sins see now here's where I'm  we're trying to enrich your vocabulary is there anything sinful about wood is there anything sinful  about stone no false gods idols are not sins they might lead you to sin but they're not sins they  are good things they're creative things you see what you have looked at though and you've promoted  and you've put them into this top place in your life and what do you say to them you made me  you define me you are my father see when you look at somebody and say without you baby what good am I  you're saying to something probably very very good you are my father you are my savior you are my  maker everywhere we look we see brokenness wars cruelty and heartache we feel it in the world  around us and in our own lives how did it get this way and what can be done about it in his  brand new book that's releasing this month what is wrong with the world Tim Keller offers a clear  and compassionate answer drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer Dr. Keller shows  how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us and how only the gospel offers lasting  freedom and healing whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world struggling with your own  mistakes or choices or looking for hope and joy what is wrong with the world will help you see how  the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us this newly  released book what is wrong with the world is our thanks for your gift this month to help gospel  and life share the good news of Jesus request your copy today at gospel and life.com slash give  that's gospel and life.com slash give now here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching  that's that's the first step the first step is you take something good wood stone  something good not a sin and you promote it and you say you are my father you are my maker you are  without you I have no definition that's the first thing but then secondly we see that leads to  addiction it says you can't be restrained see it says it's very point it's very plaintive here  verse 25 do not run until your feet are bearing your throat is dry says the Lord why you run your  feet are bare means your shoes have worn through your throat is dry you're dying of throat you're  running through the desert of course it's a terrible thing you should never run in the desert that's  where this is depicted see and but she says use but you said it's no use I must now that word must  is everything anything you have decide see as I said before if God's not the center of your life  something is right it might be work in career and job and achievement it might be beauty and love  and romance see it might be money and possessions and comfort it might be Adam Smith's invisible hand  of the market it might be heggels you know the the world's spirit or it might be baseball it might be  football it might be your music I mean you know it it might be your independence it might be some  incredibly noble cause somebody that you're some cause you're working for against injustice it  could be anything but when you say you define me you're my meaning without you don't have meaning  by achieving you you make me feel I've got worth otherwise I have no worth you have to have those  things so you are addicted to them you've got to have them and you know the best way to tell whether  you're addicted to something is not and this is what the text says not when things are going  well but when you're in trouble you see the verse 27 28 fastest way to tell is when you're in  trouble and see for example let's just say I'm sure this has got to be true some of you let's just  say you've got a really close friend and she and you talk to each other a lot I guess I'm thinking  of two women friends right now have you ever noticed for example you both went through a career  disappointment and she was okay with it and you were kind of devastated but you've also both  been through a romance disappointment right similar disappointment and for some strange reason  she was more devastated and you were okay what's going on here I'll tell you what's going on  here see you're in bed with success you're spiritually sleeping with it that's the reason why  when it's taken away from you you can't take it where she is maybe in bed spiritually with with  romance you see see we're all in bed with something but the way you can tell is usually when it's  taken away I mean here's four people at a restaurant and they're all drinking a glass of wine  once in alcoholic how do you find out how do you find out who's the alcoholic how do you find out  who's addicted to the wine not by not when they all have the wine that's not the way to tell because  you see the people who are not addicted are also drinking the way you tell is is take it away from  them take it away and say you can't have anything you see it's the absence of the addictive substance  which is really what tells you you're addicted and for most of us the only way we come to realize that  we are addicted to lover gods these lover gods that we we have a fail attraction to a lover  god to something that we feel like we've got to have is when something goes wrong and you see there's  a terrible challenge here and I've thought about this many times you see what god comes and says  where then are the gods that you made for yourselves let them come if they can save you when you  are in trouble and of course they can't it'll be a real blunt here if you build your life around your  your spouse and she builds your life around you you know if you're a man one of you is going to  see the other in a coffin someday and here's what god is saying where then will be the gods  that you've made for yourself how will they if you build your life on her how can she possibly save  you in the moment of greatest need she can't let me give you a very different view but it's really  the same what if you built your life on the idea that you are a moral decent person and therefore it  is your your moral standards your precious moral standards and your sense that I am a good person  is really the thing that gives you your meaning and your worth and what happens when you fall  what happens when you lapse what happens when you blow it how can the god of moral integrity  save you when you've just blown it do you say that this is the reason why your guilt your guilt  it will come down on you where then will the gods be it's when you're in trouble  when your heart is breaking that you come to realize the things I built my life on can't possibly save me  that's the addiction cycle now lastly there is a remarkable program here of restoration  first of all we see the dynamics of spiritual traction the dynamics of spiritual addiction those  things which we promote we get addicted to and then those things were addicted to desert us in our  time of greatest need see they're worthless and in the end we feel worthless it says in verse five  now here's the last point how can we avoid the fatal attractions how can we do that how can we keep  how can we get out of bed with the lover gods and you know what I'm not being discriminatory here  at all I'm gonna speak to Christian friends but let me speak to my let me speak to some solid  committed mature Christians whoever you are you know who dares to think I'm talking to you now  but anyway you but there are there are some of you out there let me tell you something all of your  problems come from this it doesn't matter whether you're strong Christian or we Christian or  no Christian at all this is the map of your life your lover gods and whenever you feel an  inordinate amount of anger or an inordinate amount of fear or an inordinate amount of guilt or  even an inordinate amount of boredom you can always find out why you can always get to the bottom  by asking two questions why do I feel like what is there you can say this what is there that I  feel like I've just got to have or I'm dead no meaning no worth what is it that I just feel like  I've absolutely got to have the second question is what is more what is functioning right now more  is my real savior than Jesus Christ I mean that's it's the map of your life now your lover gods  now how are you gonna deal with them there's a wonderful program there's three things were told  three things still have to be kind of brief but I want you to see them if you want to overcome  these fatal attractions if you want to get freedom here's how you do it the first thing is  personalized your understanding of sin read verses one to three with me  or actually just two and three I remember the Lord says the devotion of your youth how as a bride  you loved me and followed me through the desert through a land not soon Israel was holy to the Lord  the first fruits of his harvest all who devoured her were held guilty and disaster overtook them  now here's what I mean by vocabulary here's the vocabulary issue if you understand sin as only  breaking the law of God if that's your basic understanding of sin here's what you're gonna do  you're gonna be a scold a scold SCOLD you're gonna scold yourself when you sin and you're gonna  scold others when they sin you're breaking the law and there's only thing I know about  scolding is this anyone you scold about doing X wants to do more of X than he's ever wanted to do  before even yourself you scold your heart and your heart's gonna want to do it more and some of  you that's all you've ever done over the years you've got these things you want to overcome you  got these things you want to change and all you're ever doing is scolding your heart you're  breaking the law of God this changes our vocabulary I should say it enriches vocabulary because here's  what the text is telling us sin is breaking the heart of God one of the most vivid ways I can put  it is like this some of you have been through what all the counselors will tell you is the ultimate  psychological torture the worst thing the most stressful thing that can happen to human being  is divorce even you know that right especially when the person that you've given yourself to you've  made yourself vulnerable to them rejects you turns away from you maybe even puts him or herself  into somebody else's arms now that kind of suffering I think is probably the worst kind of  suffering there is but even though we do not want to wish this on anybody that's a terrible thing  and I know there's people in this room who've experienced that but you know what we're you know  we're learning here that's exactly how God feels if you've been through that kind of marital suffering  you get insight into God until you understand that that's how God feels about sin you don't  understand sin until you understand look at look at this language this honeymoon language you know  at verses two and three he is depicting his relationship to us as two lovebirds in fact it's almost  it's almost disrespectful you see because on the one hand he depicts us as a as a young bride  who didn't care the fact that she's marrying somebody with no money and they're going to go live in  some little hole in the well some it doesn't matter and he's even look at verse three he's depicting  himself as a sort of young man and he's just going to deck anybody that even looks cross-eyed at my  girl and you look at this and you say these two lovebirds it doesn't matter nothing matters but  that they have each other and now why in the world would God use in a sense such an unworthy illustration  because that's what his heart is like the Bible is telling us that even though God is utterly  holy and utterly majestic and in his being he does not need us we're told that God has voluntarily  done the exact the here's the other side of the sexual imagery he's made himself vulnerable to us  he cares for us he's bound up his heart with us he in a sense he's given his heart to us and when  we live for anything more than God we're doing exactly to him only far more than what people have  gone through when their spouses walked out on them you're not just breaking his law you're  breaking his heart you're stabbing him in the heart whenever you don't put him in the center  because he's put he's put you in the center of his heart do you understand sin like this here's  what here's why I want you to know this for some of us the reason we've never really been able to  change is because all we ever do is scold our heart but this will melt your heart you have to look  you have to look down until you see that what God has done is he's given his heart to us and you know  what since he's infinitely more powerful than we are infinitely more loving than we are infinitely more  you know wise than we are that must mean he he he suffers infinitely more than we do too  I mean I've seen some people I've had some very close friends have been through this this kind  of rejection where you've made yourself utterly vulnerable you put yourself in the arms of  somebody else and they have rejected you they've gone somewhere they put themselves in the arms  of someone else it hasn't happened to me when I see what what other people go through it's  devastating even even to care for somebody like that and yet God it says I'm going through something  infinitely greater than the worst experience of that and if you've been through that at least you  know a little bit about how God sees us he cares for us he loves us until you personalize your  view of sin your heart will not be melted the offeratory when you listen to it's about this  melt your heart with the personal that with the personalize your understanding of sin secondly  remember grace look at verse 5 and 6 verse 5 says this is what the Lord says what fault did your  fathers find in me that they strayed so far from me okay but then verse 6 they did not ask  where's the Lord who brought us up out of Egypt let us do the Baron wilderness through a land of  desert and rifts a land of drawton darkness a land where the reason they got an idol tree was that  they had they had spiritually forgotten their salvation they weren't constantly saying let me  remember what he's done for me the second way you can deal with lover gods is you have to  spiritually make real what what Jesus has done for you there's a place in Lord of the rings  my favorite novel where the hobbit pipin is standing at the gate of the city and in comes the great  witch king the demon king and he comes through the gate and he's about to destroy the city  and all of a sudden off in the distance horns the horns of the cavalry basically the horns of  the the riders of Rohan and they have come and even though the king of Rohan rides to his death  that day the city is saved and we're told that for the rest of his life pipin could never hear a horn  off in the distance without bursting into tears why because every time he heard a horn in the distance  it re it re-awakened the memory of his salvation and the memory of the one who died for him  now how do you listen to a distant horns what are your distant horns the sacrament when you take  the Lord supper christian friends coming to worship but unless see you get into the arms of lover  gods when you stop saying where is the Lord who did this and this and this when you you need to  remember grace you need to find ways of making it spiritually real to you you need to find ways of  doing that you can't just you can't be passive first five happened because verse six didn't happen  so first of all personalize your views and secondly remember grace but then lastly  look in the mirror verse 32 this is an amazing verse and Jeremiah couldn't possibly have known  what we know about it does a maiden forget her jewelry a brighter wedding ornaments yet my people  have forgotten me days without number now what are the what's the function of your wedding dress  rides on your wedding day you want to be perfect and the fact of the matter is you're not perfect  on the wedding day you want to be just the right size you're not the right size on the wedding day  you want to be you know flawless you're not flawless but there's something about wedding ornaments  and wedding dresses and the makeup that has never been an imperfect bride and that's the reason  why they're so important but one thing I've never seen in all my years of doing weddings I never  seen a bride get to the top of the aisle and say I didn't put my makeup on and everybody says  oh you're right heck no you know why because your bride's always looking in the mirror I mean all day  you're looking in the mirror you're come I mean can you imagine a bride getting to the top of the  aisle I forgot to look in my mirror I don't have my veil on or I don't have this third that doesn't  happen now God not only says gosh God doesn't just say just as you use your wedding  ornaments to hide your physical deformities and make yourself physically perfect looking  so I will give you something that will make you spiritually beautiful and spiritually he doesn't  say I'll give you something what does he say does a maiden forget her jewelry does a maiden  forget her wedding ornaments yet my people have forgotten me now he's saying this here's my promise  I can make you spiritually perfect and beautiful the reason you're out there working so  dog on hard the reason you're out there so upset the reason you're the reason you want your children  to be perfect the reason you want somebody to love you who's perfect the reason you're working so  on your crazy you're trying to you're trying to cover yourself you're trying to put their  ornaments you're trying to make yourself spiritually beautiful spiritually acceptable and and God  actually comes so far and says I'm not just going to give you something that makes you spiritually  acceptable I am that I can be that for you and only Jeremiah couldn't have understood but we know  and that is that Jesus Christ did not just come and die to make us forgiven Jesus Christ came we're  told in Ephesians 5 to present us spotless and radiant a bride he came to be perfect for us he says  the John the Baptist the day he's getting baptized John the Baptist says you don't need to be baptized  you're not sinful and what does Jesus say he says I have to fulfill righteousness of course he's  not doing everything perfect for him he's already perfect he's living a perfect life for us so that when  believe in him his beautiful record is put upon us and the reason we're going to love  our gods is we're trying to convince ourselves we're beautiful spiritually and God says if you  look at yourself in the mirror if you're willing to see what I have done for you if you understand  how beautiful you are in my sight because of what my son has done for you you'll be free from  your least lover gods forever you know the song that goes like this you see I will arise and go  to Jesus he will embrace me in his arms in the arms of my dear Savior oh there are 10,000 charms  go learn what that means let's pray thank you Father as we look at this passage  for the profound analysis of our souls that it gives us and for the complete program of renovation  and restoration it gives us we thank you that it's possible now for us to have our hearts melted by  the knowledge of your love for us to have our hearts maintained and and and and changed by the  remembrance of your grace for us and most of all to be completely changed by the knowledge of what  your son has not just done for us but what your son is for us with Lord these things are very very  they're deep they're wonderful if some of us have never heard this before since some people  here today have never even heard this understanding of Christianity and we pray Father that that  those of us who have heard it many times before that three holy spirit you'll become active in a  way that it's never been before and for those of us who have never heard it before that this is  just the beginning the first step of a journey and that it will end in your arms now Father give us  give us what you want to give us give us yourself we pray this in Jesus name amen  thanks for listening to today's teaching it's our prayer that you were encouraged by it and that  it helps you apply the gospel to your life and share it with

### English Transcript (for reference)

Welcome to Gospel in Life. Why is the world so broken? And why are we capable of inflicting such harm, even toward those we love? People point to politics, poverty, or psychology, but none of these fully explain what we see  in ourselves and in history. This month on the podcast, Tim Keller is teaching from a series exploring the question,  what's wrong with us?

Knowing us how the Bible's teaching on sin offers the only explanation deep enough  to face the truth in all its complexity, and the only hope, powerful enough to transform  us. Jeremiah 21 to 8 and 23 to 32. It's printed there. This is the beginning and the ending of this great chapter in the book of the Prophet,  Jeremiah. The word of the Lord came to me, go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem, I remember  the devotion of your youth, how as a bride you loved me, and followed me through the desert  through a land not sewn, Israel was holy to the Lord, the first fruits of his harvest,  all who devoured her were held guilty, and disaster overtook them, declares the Lord.

Under the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob, all you clans of the house of Israel, this  is what the Lord says. What fault did your fathers find in me that they strayed so far from me? They followed worthless idols and became worthless themselves. They did not ask, where is the Lord, who brought us up out of Egypt and led us through  the barren wilderness through a land of deserts and rifts, a land of drought and darkness,  a land where no one travels and no one lives? I brought you into a fertile land to eat its fruit and rich produce, but you came into  a file of my land and made my inheritance detestable.

The priest did not ask where is the Lord, those who deal with the law did not know me,  the leaders rebelled against me, and the prophets prophesied by bail following worthless  idols. How can you say, I am not the file, I have not run after the bail, see how you behaved  in the valley, consider what you have done, you are a swift she camel running here and  there, a wild donkey accustomed to the desert, sniffing the wind in her craving, in her  heat who can restrain her, any males that pursue her need not tire themselves at mating  time they will find her. Do not run until your feet are bare and your throat is dry, but you said, it is no use. I love foreign gods, I must go after them. As the thief is disgraced when he is caught, so the house of Israel is disgraced, they  are kings and their officials, their priests and their prophets.

They say to the wood you are my father and to stone you gave me birth, they have turned  their backs on me and not their faces yet when they are in trouble they say, come and save  us. Where then are the gods you made for yourselves? Let them come if they can save you, when you are in trouble, for you have as many gods  as you have towns, O Judah, why do you bring charges against me, you have all rebelled  against me to clear the Lord? In vain I punish your people, they did not respond to correction, your sword has devoured  your prophets like a ravening lion. You of this generation consider the word of the Lord.

Have I been a desert to Israel or a land of great darkness? Why do my people say we are free to roam, we will come to you no more, does a maiden forget  her jewelry or a bride who are wedding ornaments yet my people have forgotten me, days without  number? This is God's word. One of the reasons why we have trouble talking about sin and evil, even though we need  to, where there is things in our past that we feel vaguely guilty for, there is things  that we see people doing to us or out in the world and we feel moral outrage toward  and yet we have been taught by our society that to use the word sin or evil is oppressive  or meaningless, and yet we sense something out there that we don't have the vocabulary  for. Now what we are going to do in this series started last week, we are going to go to the  Bible because the Bible gives us a far more rich vocabulary for sin, it helps us understand  sin in ways that most of us in our society just don't.

It is so much richer, it is so much more nuanced last week, for example, we saw sin is reducing  God and the result is smallness of spirit. This week we are going to see that sin is replacing God and the result is addiction of  spirit. This is a prophecy from Jeremiah to a nation in spiritual decline and what we see here  is he is telling us three things, he is telling us about the dynamics of what we call the  dynamics of spiritual attraction, the dynamics of spiritual addiction and the dynamics of spiritual  restoration. I think as we get near the end you are going to see what I mean by what a different, what  a different, how this enriches our vocabulary when it comes to thinking of sin and evil  and how important that is very practically, but let's get started. First of all he shows us the dynamics of spiritual attraction.

All through here he is using remarkable sexual imagery. One verse which I left out, I was trying to say well I can't print the whole chapter  but we are looking in a sense of the whole chapter and there is one verse that is very  very interesting. See in verse 4-8 which we did print, we are told God is calling them to task for the fact  they are turning to idols, they are worshiping other gods, they are not worshiping him. Verses 1-3 he uses, we will get back to this, remarkable sexual imagery of a young married  couple just hopelessly in love and in the very end we are going to see, but in verse 20 this  is what I didn't print but I should have, in verse 20 there is a verse that starts this  way, it goes this way, on every high hill under every spreading chestnut, every spreading  tree you, now we say okay that is idol worship because we know that on every high hill they  had altars to bail, on under every spreading tree there were altars to bail, why will because  altars were a sign of trans, high hills were a sign of transcendence, spreading trees were  a sign of fertility, so in verse 20 you see the sentence starts like this, on every high  hill and under every spreading tree and you figure the sentence will end, you worship  idols, that's not what it says, what it says is on every high hill and under every spreading  tree you spread your legs, now I don't know what version you've got out there but I can  tell you one thing, whatever English version if you've got a Bible with you you look at it  and I know it doesn't say that, whether it's King James or RSV or the new international  version or whatever version it is it's not going to say that, but that's what it literally  says in the Hebrew, it's interesting, generally speaking, the translators feel that we're just  too sensitive or something, to actually hear what God is trying to tell us, what God says  is that when you worship idols, when you worship other gods, he says on the top of every hill  under every tree you're spreading your legs, now why would he use that kind of imagery, is he  just trying to, you know, get our attention, is he just trying to, you know, is this just  for shock value, no it's for teaching value because this is what he's teaching all through  here, why all the way through the Bible, when God talks about worshiping him, he uses sexual  imagery so often and when he talks about worshiping anything else or worshiping any worship  is used very often under the umbrella of sexual imagery, why would God do that, here's  what he's doing, he is saying that there is an attraction going on at the spiritual level  in your heart right now, every bit is powerful as the sexual attraction at the physical level  they can happen, in other words, right now he's saying there is something going on in your  soul, in the deepest recesses of your soul, you are laying down with something spiritually  you're putting yourself in the arms of something spiritually and you relate, your spiritual  relationship with that thing is every bit is powerful as a physical relationship is and a  sexual one at that, now for a minute think about physical attraction, on the one hand physical  attraction is pretty overwhelming, in fact most of us would probably say that most embarrassing  moments in our lives and most of you only you yourselves know who these are, most embarrassing  moments in our lives where times where a physical attraction kind of overwhelmed are coming  since, overwhelmed are wisdom, overwhelmed are conscience but what makes physical attraction  so strong is it just emotional infatuation, now here's a place where I'm going to turn  to the biologist because actually Jeremiah turns to the biologist, I usually don't, generally I'm  not going to go to a biologist and say tell me about the sexual instinct, I don't usually like  what I hear, in fact you don't either, most people don't, but it's intriguing, Jeremiah  likens us and it's really pretty powerful, likens us to an animal at one point, not just to  a bride like in the very beginning of chapter two and at the very end but here in the very middle  he says see how you behaved in the valley, he were a swift she camel running here and there  a wild donkey a custom to the desert sniffing the wind in her craving in her heat, now here's what  the biologists are going to tell you why is the physical desire, why is sexual desire so important  and it's this collectively speaking we are dead unless we find somebody else, we cannot reproduce  ourselves, this is what the biologists would tell you, the biologists would say that unless you're  Godzilla, this is true of every other species, there's something in the male that only the male  produces, that has to get together with something in the female produces or else your race is over,  your species is over, you're over and therefore the biologists will tell you is a big root of this  incredible physical attraction, is collectively speaking male gender or female gender by itself  is incomplete and it's dead unless you literally get together, that's certainly obviously there's  nothing emotional about animals and yet the physical attraction is incredibly powerful, there's no  emotional involvement we can tell, oh where's it come from, it comes from the fact that we are  biologically speaking we're incomplete collectively okay, now why this powerful sexual imagery,  here's why, this passage, this text is not talking at all about Israel's sexual practices, it's not  talking at all about sexual ethics, it's talking about religion, you know it's very interesting  down on St. Mark's place across from Kim's video there's a story it says religious sex  and it's very attention getting it's sort of avant-garde and cool to call something religious  sex why because in our mind religion and sex are two totally different things they're total  opposites so put it together kind of gets to you right that's why they chose it it's St.

Mark's  place you know we're we're avant-garde we're unusual we're shocking well God beat them to it  Jeremiah did this 2500 years ago and here's what they're saying  there is deep in your soul a spiritual desire even more powerful than the desires that  inform physical attraction and it's this you cannot produce your own meaning in life you cannot by  yourself produce your own worth you cannot produce your own security everybody has got to have  some meaning in life or else life is empty everybody's got to have some affirmation of your worth  or else you feel worthless everybody's got to have some security or you can't face life but you  cannot produce it yourself anymore then you can reproduce your own species your own your own your  own life you can't reproduce that spirituality whether you can reproduce yourself physically all by  yourself you have you can't just say all that matters to me is I like me you're never going  to get your worth that way you can't say I'm just going to live for my own happiness you'll never  get your meaning that way there's got to be something else besides you that is a source of your  meaning the source of your worth the source of your security and you are dry for that you're  need for that you need to take hold of whatever that is that's be something or somebody or some  some person or some pursuit or some relationship or some goal or some condition or some practice  something you are powerless to reproduce to produce in your heart meaning and worth and security  as you are physically able to reproduce reproduce your own life and so spiritually speaking if it's  not God who's the lover of your soul if it's not God in whose arms you are spiritually if it's  not God whose meaning is the source of your meaning whose affirmation is the source of your  self-worth and whose power is the source of security if it's not God you're in bed with something  spiritually something you've given yourself to in realm so deep and so profound that God here  is saying you are as every bit spiritually beholden to it as you are physically beholden you every  bit is spiritually laid out as spread out as vulnerable to it physically as you are physically when  you're having sex with someone you're doing the very same thing spiritually that you do in bed  with someone physically same thing you've got to have this you're spiritually incomplete  and therefore you're in bed with something now let's take a minute before we move on  can I show you how radically different this view is of soul and of spirit than what you're going  to hear about or read about if you go into Barnes and Noble and you go to the section on soul and  spirit it it's getting bigger every year there are just tons of book on soul care of the soul  and help for the soul and chicken soup for the soul or the spirit you know care for the spirit  and if you go in get those books down they're all very very different and yet they're all the same  first of all they depict the soul as a pond a sort of still lake but the Bible depicts the soul as a  restless turbulent ocean or whenever they talk all these books talk about the cure of the soul  or the care of the soul what they usually they talk about getting into quiet places and they  think about it and think inspirational thoughts reflect you see be quiet see the soul is is  that sort of thing and the Bible says something so much more robust so much more robust so much  more vital so much for a lie your soul are your soul is too empty arms your soul is an utterly empty  heart and you must run after things in order to fill that I can't help it says the soul I must run  after them see completely different approach not only to your soul your soul doesn't just need to be  petted there there your soul needs love your soul needs rapture your soul needs passion all right  but it's also giving us a completely different view not just of the soul but it's a completely  different view of God if you take those books down if they ever do talk about God many of them just  don't but if they ever do talk about that God they talk about God in the sense of being  someone who sort of gives peace a sort of a remote a power a force and God here says  I am not just a remote force in fact I am not just a sovereign you obey let me tell you what I  built you for I want to be the lover of your soul I want to be the center of your heart  look he's saying at the sex act look at the greatest rapturous bit of sexual love  that is just a dim hint of what closure between your soul and my soul will be  that's what I've made you for that's what I want you to be with me  you know I mean you know there are a lot of people go in and they think this is great this  approach to the soul the modern new age spirituality and they just say that and it seems so  cool it seems so avant-garde you see it seems so much more it seems much better than the  wooden mechanical understanding people have of Christianity but Christianity real Christianity  look what we're seeing look what we're talking about this view of the soul this view of God  God says I want you my arms power the dynamics of spiritual traction and he says if I'm not if I'm  not in your arms if you're not in my arms you're in your arms with something now the second thing  we learned I'm going to be brief on this because a lot of you know this and what you would rather have  you'd like to know I'm pretty good at telling you what's wrong with you and some of you are going to  say I've heard this part before I'd like to find out what to do about it so let me be brief the  second thing we learn here is also the dynamics of spiritual addiction because what God is saying is  if you don't have me in your arms if you if you're in the arms of anything else you're in deep  trouble you're actually an addiction cycle let me show you how that cycle runs so briefly first  of all the first part of the cycle is you promote something look here in verse 27 they say the  word you are my father and a stone you gave me birth and then you say okay you're my father you  gave me birth now what is some of you're saying okay what do you mean if you're not worshiping God  if he's not the center of your life if he's not the center of your heart if he's not your greatest  joy if you don't have that kind of intimacy with him well I'm turning to other gods well what do you  mean when you think of idolatry and false gods usually think of sins see now here's where I'm  we're trying to enrich your vocabulary is there anything sinful about wood is there anything sinful  about stone no false gods idols are not sins they might lead you to sin but they're not sins they  are good things they're creative things you see what you have looked at though and you've promoted  and you've put them into this top place in your life and what do you say to them you made me  you define me you are my father see when you look at somebody and say without you baby what good am I  you're saying to something probably very very good you are my father you are my savior you are my  maker everywhere we look we see brokenness wars cruelty and heartache we feel it in the world  around us and in our own lives how did it get this way and what can be done about it in his  brand new book that's releasing this month what is wrong with the world Tim Keller offers a clear  and compassionate answer drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer Dr. Keller shows  how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us and how only the gospel offers lasting  freedom and healing whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world struggling with your own  mistakes or choices or looking for hope and joy what is wrong with the world will help you see how  the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us this newly  released book what is wrong with the world is our thanks for your gift this month to help gospel  and life share the good news of Jesus request your copy today at gospel and life.com slash give  that's gospel and life.com slash give now here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching  that's that's the first step the first step is you take something good wood stone  something good not a sin and you promote it and you say you are my father you are my maker you are  without you I have no definition that's the first thing but then secondly we see that leads to  addiction it says you can't be restrained see it says it's very point it's very plaintive here  verse 25 do not run until your feet are bearing your throat is dry says the Lord why you run your  feet are bare means your shoes have worn through your throat is dry you're dying of throat you're  running through the desert of course it's a terrible thing you should never run in the desert that's  where this is depicted see and but she says use but you said it's no use I must now that word must  is everything anything you have decide see as I said before if God's not the center of your life  something is right it might be work in career and job and achievement it might be beauty and love  and romance see it might be money and possessions and comfort it might be Adam Smith's invisible hand  of the market it might be heggels you know the the world's spirit or it might be baseball it might be  football it might be your music I mean you know it it might be your independence it might be some  incredibly noble cause somebody that you're some cause you're working for against injustice it  could be anything but when you say you define me you're my meaning without you don't have meaning  by achieving you you make me feel I've got worth otherwise I have no worth you have to have those  things so you are addicted to them you've got to have them and you know the best way to tell whether  you're addicted to something is not and this is what the text says not when things are going  well but when you're in trouble you see the verse 27 28 fastest way to tell is when you're in  trouble and see for example let's just say I'm sure this has got to be true some of you let's just  say you've got a really close friend and she and you talk to each other a lot I guess I'm thinking  of two women friends right now have you ever noticed for example you both went through a career  disappointment and she was okay with it and you were kind of devastated but you've also both  been through a romance disappointment right similar disappointment and for some strange reason  she was more devastated and you were okay what's going on here I'll tell you what's going on  here see you're in bed with success you're spiritually sleeping with it that's the reason why  when it's taken away from you you can't take it where she is maybe in bed spiritually with with  romance you see see we're all in bed with something but the way you can tell is usually when it's  taken away I mean here's four people at a restaurant and they're all drinking a glass of wine  once in alcoholic how do you find out how do you find out who's the alcoholic how do you find out  who's addicted to the wine not by not when they all have the wine that's not the way to tell because  you see the people who are not addicted are also drinking the way you tell is is take it away from  them take it away and say you can't have anything you see it's the absence of the addictive substance  which is really what tells you you're addicted and for most of us the only way we come to realize that  we are addicted to lover gods these lover gods that we we have a fail attraction to a lover  god to something that we feel like we've got to have is when something goes wrong and you see there's  a terrible challenge here and I've thought about this many times you see what god comes and says  where then are the gods that you made for yourselves let them come if they can save you when you  are in trouble and of course they can't it'll be a real blunt here if you build your life around your  your spouse and she builds your life around you you know if you're a man one of you is going to  see the other in a coffin someday and here's what god is saying where then will be the gods  that you've made for yourself how will they if you build your life on her how can she possibly save  you in the moment of greatest need she can't let me give you a very different view but it's really  the same what if you built your life on the idea that you are a moral decent person and therefore it  is your your moral standards your precious moral standards and your sense that I am a good person  is really the thing that gives you your meaning and your worth and what happens when you fall  what happens when you lapse what happens when you blow it how can the god of moral integrity  save you when you've just blown it do you say that this is the reason why your guilt your guilt  it will come down on you where then will the gods be it's when you're in trouble  when your heart is breaking that you come to realize the things I built my life on can't possibly save me  that's the addiction cycle now lastly there is a remarkable program here of restoration  first of all we see the dynamics of spiritual traction the dynamics of spiritual addiction those  things which we promote we get addicted to and then those things were addicted to desert us in our  time of greatest need see they're worthless and in the end we feel worthless it says in verse five  now here's the last point how can we avoid the fatal attractions how can we do that how can we keep  how can we get out of bed with the lover gods and you know what I'm not being discriminatory here  at all I'm gonna speak to Christian friends but let me speak to my let me speak to some solid  committed mature Christians whoever you are you know who dares to think I'm talking to you now  but anyway you but there are there are some of you out there let me tell you something all of your  problems come from this it doesn't matter whether you're strong Christian or we Christian or  no Christian at all this is the map of your life your lover gods and whenever you feel an  inordinate amount of anger or an inordinate amount of fear or an inordinate amount of guilt or  even an inordinate amount of boredom you can always find out why you can always get to the bottom  by asking two questions why do I feel like what is there you can say this what is there that I  feel like I've just got to have or I'm dead no meaning no worth what is it that I just feel like  I've absolutely got to have the second question is what is more what is functioning right now more  is my real savior than Jesus Christ I mean that's it's the map of your life now your lover gods  now how are you gonna deal with them there's a wonderful program there's three things were told  three things still have to be kind of brief but I want you to see them if you want to overcome  these fatal attractions if you want to get freedom here's how you do it the first thing is  personalized your understanding of sin read verses one to three with me  or actually just two and three I remember the Lord says the devotion of your youth how as a bride  you loved me and followed me through the desert through a land not soon Israel was holy to the Lord  the first fruits of his harvest all who devoured her were held guilty and disaster overtook them  now here's what I mean by vocabulary here's the vocabulary issue if you understand sin as only  breaking the law of God if that's your basic understanding of sin here's what you're gonna do  you're gonna be a scold a scold SCOLD you're gonna scold yourself when you sin and you're gonna  scold others when they sin you're breaking the law and there's only thing I know about  scolding is this anyone you scold about doing X wants to do more of X than he's ever wanted to do  before even yourself you scold your heart and your heart's gonna want to do it more and some of  you that's all you've ever done over the years you've got these things you want to overcome you  got these things you want to change and all you're ever doing is scolding your heart you're  breaking the law of God this changes our vocabulary I should say it enriches vocabulary because here's  what the text is telling us sin is breaking the heart of God one of the most vivid ways I can put  it is like this some of you have been through what all the counselors will tell you is the ultimate  psychological torture the worst thing the most stressful thing that can happen to human being  is divorce even you know that right especially when the person that you've given yourself to you've  made yourself vulnerable to them rejects you turns away from you maybe even puts him or herself  into somebody else's arms now that kind of suffering I think is probably the worst kind of  suffering there is but even though we do not want to wish this on anybody that's a terrible thing  and I know there's people in this room who've experienced that but you know what we're you know  we're learning here that's exactly how God feels if you've been through that kind of marital suffering  you get insight into God until you understand that that's how God feels about sin you don't  understand sin until you understand look at look at this language this honeymoon language you know  at verses two and three he is depicting his relationship to us as two lovebirds in fact it's almost  it's almost disrespectful you see because on the one hand he depicts us as a as a young bride  who didn't care the fact that she's marrying somebody with no money and they're going to go live in  some little hole in the well some it doesn't matter and he's even look at verse three he's depicting  himself as a sort of young man and he's just going to deck anybody that even looks cross-eyed at my  girl and you look at this and you say these two lovebirds it doesn't matter nothing matters but  that they have each other and now why in the world would God use in a sense such an unworthy illustration  because that's what his heart is like the Bible is telling us that even though God is utterly  holy and utterly majestic and in his being he does not need us we're told that God has voluntarily  done the exact the here's the other side of the sexual imagery he's made himself vulnerable to us  he cares for us he's bound up his heart with us he in a sense he's given his heart to us and when  we live for anything more than God we're doing exactly to him only far more than what people have  gone through when their spouses walked out on them you're not just breaking his law you're  breaking his heart you're stabbing him in the heart whenever you don't put him in the center  because he's put he's put you in the center of his heart do you understand sin like this here's  what here's why I want you to know this for some of us the reason we've never really been able to  change is because all we ever do is scold our heart but this will melt your heart you have to look  you have to look down until you see that what God has done is he's given his heart to us and you know  what since he's infinitely more powerful than we are infinitely more loving than we are infinitely more  you know wise than we are that must mean he he he suffers infinitely more than we do too  I mean I've seen some people I've had some very close friends have been through this this kind  of rejection where you've made yourself utterly vulnerable you put yourself in the arms of  somebody else and they have rejected you they've gone somewhere they put themselves in the arms  of someone else it hasn't happened to me when I see what what other people go through it's  devastating even even to care for somebody like that and yet God it says I'm going through something  infinitely greater than the worst experience of that and if you've been through that at least you  know a little bit about how God sees us he cares for us he loves us until you personalize your  view of sin your heart will not be melted the offeratory when you listen to it's about this  melt your heart with the personal that with the personalize your understanding of sin secondly  remember grace look at verse 5 and 6 verse 5 says this is what the Lord says what fault did your  fathers find in me that they strayed so far from me okay but then verse 6 they did not ask  where's the Lord who brought us up out of Egypt let us do the Baron wilderness through a land of  desert and rifts a land of drawton darkness a land where the reason they got an idol tree was that  they had they had spiritually forgotten their salvation they weren't constantly saying let me  remember what he's done for me the second way you can deal with lover gods is you have to  spiritually make real what what Jesus has done for you there's a place in Lord of the rings  my favorite novel where the hobbit pipin is standing at the gate of the city and in comes the great  witch king the demon king and he comes through the gate and he's about to destroy the city  and all of a sudden off in the distance horns the horns of the cavalry basically the horns of  the the riders of Rohan and they have come and even though the king of Rohan rides to his death  that day the city is saved and we're told that for the rest of his life pipin could never hear a horn  off in the distance without bursting into tears why because every time he heard a horn in the distance  it re it re-awakened the memory of his salvation and the memory of the one who died for him  now how do you listen to a distant horns what are your distant horns the sacrament when you take  the Lord supper christian friends coming to worship but unless see you get into the arms of lover  gods when you stop saying where is the Lord who did this and this and this when you you need to  remember grace you need to find ways of making it spiritually real to you you need to find ways of  doing that you can't just you can't be passive first five happened because verse six didn't happen  so first of all personalize your views and secondly remember grace but then lastly  look in the mirror verse 32 this is an amazing verse and Jeremiah couldn't possibly have known  what we know about it does a maiden forget her jewelry a brighter wedding ornaments yet my people  have forgotten me days without number now what are the what's the function of your wedding dress  rides on your wedding day you want to be perfect and the fact of the matter is you're not perfect  on the wedding day you want to be just the right size you're not the right size on the wedding day  you want to be you know flawless you're not flawless but there's something about wedding ornaments  and wedding dresses and the makeup that has never been an imperfect bride and that's the reason  why they're so important but one thing I've never seen in all my years of doing weddings I never  seen a bride get to the top of the aisle and say I didn't put my makeup on and everybody says  oh you're right heck no you know why because your bride's always looking in the mirror I mean all day  you're looking in the mirror you're come I mean can you imagine a bride getting to the top of the  aisle I forgot to look in my mirror I don't have my veil on or I don't have this third that doesn't  happen now God not only says gosh God doesn't just say just as you use your wedding  ornaments to hide your physical deformities and make yourself physically perfect looking  so I will give you something that will make you spiritually beautiful and spiritually he doesn't  say I'll give you something what does he say does a maiden forget her jewelry does a maiden  forget her wedding ornaments yet my people have forgotten me now he's saying this here's my promise  I can make you spiritually perfect and beautiful the reason you're out there working so  dog on hard the reason you're out there so upset the reason you're the reason you want your children  to be perfect the reason you want somebody to love you who's perfect the reason you're working so  on your crazy you're trying to you're trying to cover yourself you're trying to put their  ornaments you're trying to make yourself spiritually beautiful spiritually acceptable and and God  actually comes so far and says I'm not just going to give you something that makes you spiritually  acceptable I am that I can be that for you and only Jeremiah couldn't have understood but we know  and that is that Jesus Christ did not just come and die to make us forgiven Jesus Christ came we're  told in Ephesians 5 to present us spotless and radiant a bride he came to be perfect for us he says  the John the Baptist the day he's getting baptized John the Baptist says you don't need to be baptized  you're not sinful and what does Jesus say he says I have to fulfill righteousness of course he's  not doing everything perfect for him he's already perfect he's living a perfect life for us so that when  believe in him his beautiful record is put upon us and the reason we're going to love  our gods is we're trying to convince ourselves we're beautiful spiritually and God says if you  look at yourself in the mirror if you're willing to see what I have done for you if you understand  how beautiful you are in my sight because of what my son has done for you you'll be free from  your least lover gods forever you know the song that goes like this you see I will arise and go  to Jesus he will embrace me in his arms in the arms of my dear Savior oh there are 10,000 charms  go learn what that means let's pray thank you Father as we look at this passage  for the profound analysis of our souls that it gives us and for the complete program of renovation  and restoration it gives us we thank you that it's possible now for us to have our hearts melted by  the knowledge of your love for us to have our hearts maintained and and and and changed by the  remembrance of your grace for us and most of all to be completely changed by the knowledge of what  your son has not just done for us but what your son is for us with Lord these things are very very  they're deep they're wonderful if some of us have never heard this before since some people  here today have never even heard this understanding of Christianity and we pray Father that that  those of us who have heard it many times before that three holy spirit you'll become active in a  way that it's never been before and for those of us who have never heard it before that this is  just the beginning the first step of a journey and that it will end in your arms now Father give us  give us what you want to give us give us yourself we pray this in Jesus name amen  thanks for listening to today's teaching it's our prayer that you were encouraged by it and that  it helps you apply the gospel to your life and share it with

欢迎来到福音人生。为什么这个世界如此破碎?为什么我们能够造成如此大的伤害,甚至对我们所爱的人?人们指向政治、贫困或心理学,但这些都不能完全解释我们在自己和历史中所看到的。本月在播客中,Tim Keller正在从一系列探讨这个问题的教导中讲授:我们到底怎么了?

了解圣经关于罪的教导如何提供唯一足够深刻的解释来面对所有复杂性中的真相,以及唯一足够强大的希望来改变我们。耶利米书2章1到8节和23到32节。印在那里。这是先知耶利米书中这伟大一章的开头和结尾。耶和华的话临到我说:你去向耶路撒冷人的耳中喊叫说,我记得你幼年的恩爱,你作新妇的时候怎样爱我,在旷野,在未曾耕种之地怎样跟随我。那时以色列归耶和华为圣,作为初熟的果子;凡吞吃它的必算为有罪,灾祸必临到他们。这是耶和华说的。

雅各家,以色列家的各族啊,你们当听耶和华的话。耶和华如此说:你们的列祖见我有什么不义,竟远离我,随从虚无的神,自己成为虚妄?他们也不说:那领我们从埃及地上来,引导我们经过旷野,沙漠有深坑之地,和干旱死荫、无人经过、无人居住之地的耶和华在哪里呢?我领你们进入肥美之地,使你们得吃其中的果子和美物;但你们进入的时候,就玷污我的地,使我的产业成为可憎的。

祭司都不说,耶和华在哪里呢?传讲律法的,都不认识我;官长违背我;先知藉巴力说预言,随从无益的神。你怎么说:我没有玷污,没有随从众巴力?你看你在谷中的行径,就知道你所行的如何;你是快行的独峰驼,狂奔乱走。你是野驴,惯在旷野,欲心发动就吸风;起性的时候谁能使它转去呢?凡寻找它的必不至疲倦,在它的月份必能寻见。我说,你不要使脚上无鞋,喉咙干渴;你倒说,这是枉然。我喜爱别神,我必随从他们。贼被捉拿,怎样羞愧,以色列家和他们的君王、首领、祭司、先知,也都照样羞愧。

他们向木头说:你是我的父;向石头说:你是生我的;他们以背向我,不以面向我;及至遭遇患难的时候,却说:起来拯救我们。你为自己做的神在哪里呢?你遭遇患难的时候,叫他们起来拯救你吧。犹大啊,你神的数目与你城的数目相等。你们为何与我争辩呢?你们都违背了我。这是耶和华说的。我责打你们的儿女,是徒然的;他们不受惩治。你们自己的刀,吞灭你们的先知,好像残害的狮子。

这世代的人哪,你们要看明耶和华的话。我岂向以色列作旷野呢?或作幽暗之地呢?我的百姓为何说:我们脱离约束,再不归向你了?处女岂能忘记她的妆饰呢?新妇岂能忘记她的美衣呢?我的百姓却忘记了我无数的日子。这是神的话。我们难以谈论罪和恶的原因之一,即使我们需要,是因为过去有些事情我们感到模糊的内疚,有些事情我们看到别人对我们做的或在世界上发生的,我们对此感到道德愤怒,然而我们的社会教导我们使用罪或恶这个词是压迫性的或毫无意义的,然而我们感觉到有些东西在那里,但我们没有词汇来表达。

现在我们将在这个系列中从上周开始做的事情,我们要去圣经,因为圣经给了我们关于罪的更丰富的词汇,它帮助我们以我们社会中大多数人不理解的方式来理解罪。它是如此丰富,如此细致入微,例如上周,我们看到罪是贬低神,结果是灵性的狭小。本周我们将看到罪是取代神,结果是灵性的成瘾。这是耶利米对一个灵性衰落国家的预言,我们在这里看到的是他告诉我们三件事,他告诉我们关于我们所说的灵性吸引力的动态、灵性成瘾的动态和灵性恢复的动态。我想当我们接近结尾时,你会看到我所说的不同之处,当涉及到思考罪和恶时,这如何丰富我们的词汇,以及这在实践中是多么重要,但让我们开始吧。首先,他向我们展示了灵性吸引力的动态。

在整个这里,他使用了非凡的性意象。有一节我省略了,我试图说好吧我不能打印整章,但在某种意义上我们正在看整章,有一节非常非常有趣。看第4-8节我们确实打印了,我们被告知神在责备他们转向偶像,他们敬拜其他神,他们不敬拜他。第1-3节他使用,我们会回到这个,非凡的性意象描述一对刚结婚的年轻夫妇无可救药地相爱,在最后我们将看到,但在第20节这是我没有打印但我应该打印的,在第20节有一节是这样开始的,它是这样说的:在各高冈上,各青翠树下,现在我们说好吧,那是偶像崇拜,因为我们知道在各高冈上他们有巴力的祭坛,在各青翠树下有巴力的祭坛,为什么,因为祭坛是超越的标志,高冈是超越的标志,青翠的树是丰饶的标志,所以在第20节你看到这句话是这样开始的:在各高冈上,各青翠树下,你认为这句话会以你敬拜偶像结束,但不是这样说的,它说的是在各高冈上,各青翠树下你张开你的腿,现在我不知道你那里有什么版本,但我可以告诉你一件事,无论什么英文版本,如果你随身带着圣经你看看它,我知道它不会这样说,无论是钦定本还是RSV还是新国际版或其他任何版本,它都不会这样说,但这就是希伯来文字面上所说的,有趣的是,一般来说,译者觉得我们太敏感了或什么,实际上听不到神试图告诉我们的,神说的是当你敬拜偶像时,当你敬拜其他神时,他说在每个山顶上,每棵树下你在张开你的腿,现在他为什么会使用那种意象,他只是试图引起我们的注意吗,你知道,这只是为了震撼价值吗,不,这是为了教学价值,因为这就是他在这里一直在教导的,为什么圣经中到处都是,当神谈论敬拜他时,他经常使用性意象,当他谈论敬拜其他任何东西或敬拜时,经常在性意象的伞下使用,为什么神会这样做,这就是他在做的,他说在你内心的灵性层面上正在发生一种吸引,其力量完全等同于物理层面上可能发生的性吸引,换句话说,现在他说在你的灵魂中正在发生一些事情,在你灵魂的最深处,你正在灵性上与某物躺在一起,你正在将自己放在某物的怀抱中,你的灵性关系与那个东西的力量完全等同于身体关系,而且是性关系,现在想一想身体吸引,一方面身体吸引相当压倒性,事实上我们大多数人可能会说我们生活中最尴尬的时刻,只有你自己知道这些是谁,我们生活中最尴尬的时刻是身体吸引有点压倒我们即将到来的时刻,压倒我们的智慧,压倒我们的良心,但是什么使得身体吸引如此强大,这只是情感迷恋吗,现在这是一个地方,我要转向生物学家,因为实际上耶利米转向生物学家,我通常不这样做,一般来说我不会去找生物学家说告诉我关于性本能的事情,我通常不喜欢我听到的,事实上你也不喜欢,大多数人都不喜欢,但很有趣,耶利米在某一点上把我们比作动物,这真的很有力,不仅仅是像在第二章的开头和结尾那样的新娘,而是在这里的中间,他说看你在谷中的行径,你是快行的独峰驼,狂奔乱走,你是野驴,惯在旷野,欲心发动就吸风,起性的时候,现在这就是生物学家要告诉你的,为什么身体欲望,为什么性欲如此重要,这是,从集体上讲,除非我们找到其他人,否则我们就死了,我们不能繁殖自己,这就是生物学家会告诉你的,生物学家会说,除非你是哥斯拉,这对每个其他物种都是真实的,男性中有些东西只有男性产生,必须与女性产生的东西结合在一起,否则你的种族就结束了,你的物种就结束了,你就结束了,因此生物学家会告诉你这是这种令人难以置信的身体吸引的一大根源,从集体上讲,男性性别或女性性别本身是不完整的,除非你真的结合在一起,否则就死了,这显然没有什么情感因素,动物和然而身体吸引力非常强大,据我们所知没有情感参与,哦,它从哪里来,它来自我们在生物学上讲从集体上讲我们是不完整的好吧,现在为什么这种强大的性意象,这就是原因,这段经文,这段文本根本不是在谈论以色列的性行为,它根本不是在谈论性伦理,它在谈论宗教,你知道在圣马可广场对面Kim's video那里有一家店很有趣,它说宗教性,这很吸引注意力,这有点前卫和酷,称某物为宗教性,为什么,因为在我们的头脑中宗教和性是两个完全不同的东西,它们是完全相反的,所以把它们放在一起有点触动你,对吧,这就是他们选择它的原因,这是圣马可广场,你知道我们很前卫,我们很不寻常,我们很震撼,嗯,神早就这样做了,耶利米在2500年前就这样做了,这就是他们在说什么。

在你灵魂深处有一种灵性欲望,甚至比影响身体吸引的欲望更强大,就是这样,你不能自己产生你生命的意义,你不能自己产生你自己的价值,你不能产生你自己的安全感,每个人都必须有生命中的某种意义,否则生命就是空虚的,每个人都必须有对你价值的某种肯定,否则你感到毫无价值,每个人都必须有某种安全感,否则你无法面对生活,但你不能自己产生它,就像你不能自己繁殖你自己的物种一样,你自己的生命,你不能繁殖那个,在灵性上,你能否在物理上完全靠自己繁殖自己,你不能只是说我唯一关心的是我喜欢我,你永远不会那样得到你的价值,你不能说我只是为了我自己的幸福而活,你永远不会那样得到你的意义,必须有除了你之外的其他东西,那是你意义的源泉,你价值的源泉,你安全感的源泉,你渴望那个,你需要抓住无论那是什么,那必须是某物或某人或某个人或某种追求或某种关系或某个目标或某种状况或某种实践,某物,你无力在你心中产生意义、价值和安全感,就像你在物理上能够繁殖自己的生命一样,所以在灵性上讲,如果不是神作为你灵魂的情人,如果你在灵性上不在他的怀抱中,如果不是神的意义是你意义的源泉,神的肯定是你自我价值的源泉,神的能力是安全感的源泉,如果不是神,你在灵性上与某物同床,你在如此深刻和深远的领域中已经把自己交给了某物,以至于神在这里说,你在灵性上完全依赖它,就像你在身体上依赖它一样,你在灵性上完全展开,完全暴露,完全脆弱于它,就像你在与某人发生性关系时在身体上一样,你在灵性上做的事情与你在床上与某人身体上做的事情完全一样,同样的事情,你必须拥有这个,你在灵性上是不完整的,因此你与某物同床,现在让我们在继续之前花一点时间,我能告诉你这种灵魂和灵性的观点与你去巴诺书店进入灵魂和灵性部分时会听到或读到的有多么根本不同吗,它每年都在变大,有很多关于灵魂、灵魂关怀、灵魂帮助和心灵鸡汤或灵性的书籍,你知道灵性关怀,如果你拿下那些书,它们都非常非常不同,但它们都是一样的,首先它们将灵魂描绘成一个池塘,一种平静的湖泊,但圣经将灵魂描绘成一个不安的汹涌海洋,或者每当他们谈论所有这些书籍都谈论灵魂的治愈或灵魂的关怀时,他们通常谈论进入安静的地方,他们思考它,思考鼓舞人心的想法,反思,你看,安静,看,灵魂就是那种东西,圣经说的东西要强健得多,要强健得多,要有活力得多,要强健得多,要强健得多,要有活力得多,你的灵魂是你的灵魂是两只完全空虚的手臂,你的灵魂是一颗完全空虚的心,你必须追赶事物以填满它,灵魂说我忍不住,我必须追赶它们,看,完全不同的方法,不仅对你的灵魂,你的灵魂不仅需要被抚摸,在那里,你的灵魂需要爱,你的灵魂需要狂喜,你的灵魂需要激情,好吧,但它也给我们一个完全不同的观点,不仅是灵魂的完全不同观点,而且是神的完全不同观点,如果你拿下那些书,如果他们确实谈论神,其中许多根本不谈,但如果他们确实谈论那个神,他们谈论神的意义是某种给予和平的人,某种遥远的力量,一种力量,神在这里说,我不仅仅是一个遥远的力量,事实上我不仅仅是一个你服从的主权者,让我告诉你我为你建造了什么,我想成为你灵魂的情人,我想成为你心的中心,看,他说性行为,看最伟大的狂喜的性爱,那只是一个暗淡的暗示,你的灵魂和我的灵魂之间的亲密将是什么,那就是我为你创造的,那就是我想让你与我在一起的,你知道我的意思,你知道有很多人进去,他们认为这很棒,这种灵魂的方法,现代的新时代灵性,他们只是说那个,它看起来很酷,它看起来很前卫,你看,它看起来好多了,它看起来比人们对基督教的僵化机械理解要好得多,但基督教,真正的基督教,看我们看到的,看我们在谈论的,这种灵魂观,这种神观,神说我想要你在我的怀抱中,有力量,灵性吸引的动态,他说如果我不在,如果你不在我的怀抱中,如果你不在我的怀抱中,你在你的怀抱中与某物在一起,现在我要学到的第二件事,我会对此简短,因为你们很多人知道这个,你们想要的是,你们想知道我很擅长告诉你你有什么问题,你们有些人会说我以前听过这部分,我想知道该怎么办,所以让我简短点,我们在这里学到的第二件事也是灵性成瘾的动态,因为神说的是,如果你没有我在你的怀抱中,如果你在其他任何东西的怀抱中,你就有大麻烦了,你实际上处于成瘾循环中,让我简要地向你展示这个循环是如何运行的,首先,循环的第一部分是你提升某物,看这里第27节,他们向木头说你是我的父,向石头说你是生我的,然后你说好吧,你是我的父,你生了我,现在你们有些人说好吧,你是什么意思,如果你不敬拜神,如果他不是你生命的中心,如果他不是你心的中心,如果他不是你最大的喜悦,如果你与他没有那种亲密关系,嗯,我转向其他神,嗯,当你想到偶像崇拜和假神时,你是什么意思,通常认为是罪,看,现在这就是我们试图丰富你的词汇的地方,木头有什么罪吗,石头有什么罪吗,没有,假神偶像不是罪,它们可能导致你犯罪,但它们不是罪,它们是好东西,它们是创造性的东西,你看你所看到的,你提升了它们,你把它们放在你生命的最高位置,你对它们说什么,你创造了我,你定义了我,你是我的父,看,当你看着某人说没有你宝贝我有什么好,你是在对某物说,可能是非常非常好的,你是我的父,你是我的救主,你是我的创造者,我们到处看到破碎,战争,残酷和心痛,我们在我们周围的世界和我们自己的生活中感受到它,它是如何变成这样的,可以做些什么,在他本月发布的全新书籍中,世界到底怎么了,Tim Keller提供了一个清晰而富有同情心的答案,从在救赎者教会的一系列教导中汲取,Keller博士展示了罪的现实如何解释我们在周围看到的痛苦,以及只有福音才能提供持久的自由和医治,无论你是被我们世界的状态所压倒,还是在与自己的错误或选择作斗争,或者在寻找希望和喜悦,世界到底怎么了都会帮助你看到福音如何对我们世界的心痛和我们每个人内心的痛苦说话,这本新发布的书世界到底怎么了是我们对你本月帮助福音和生命分享耶稣的好消息的礼物的感谢,今天在gospelandlife.com/give上请求你的副本,那是gospelandlife.com/give,现在这是Keller博士对今天教导的其余部分。

那是第一步,第一步是你拿一些好东西,木头,石头,一些好东西,不是罪,你提升它,你说你是我的父,你是我的创造者,你是没有你我没有定义,这是第一件事,但其次我们看到这导致成瘾,它说你无法被约束,看它说这非常尖锐,这里非常哀怨,第25节,我说你不要使脚上无鞋,喉咙干渴,主说,为什么你跑你的脚赤裸意味着你的鞋子已经磨穿了,你的喉咙干渴,你在沙漠中快要渴死了,当然这是一件可怕的事情,你永远不应该在沙漠中奔跑,那就是这被描绘的地方,看,但她说使用,但你说这是枉然,我必须,现在那个词必须就是一切,你决定看到的任何东西,就像我之前说的,如果神不是你生命的中心,某物就是,对吧,它可能是工作和职业和工作和成就,它可能是美丽和爱和浪漫,看,它可能是金钱和财产和舒适,它可能是亚当·斯密的市场无形之手,它可能是黑格尔的你知道世界精神,或者它可能是棒球,它可能是足球,它可能是你的音乐,我的意思是你知道它,它可能是你的独立,它可能是你正在为之工作的某个令人难以置信的崇高事业,某个你正在为之工作的反对不公正的事业,它可能是任何东西,但当你说你定义我,你是我的意义,没有你我没有意义,通过实现你,你让我感觉我有价值,否则我没有价值,你必须拥有那些东西,所以你对它们上瘾了,你必须拥有它们,你知道判断你是否对某物上瘾的最好方法不是,这就是文本所说的,不是当事情进展顺利时,而是当你遇到麻烦时,你看第27-28节,最快的判断方法是当你遇到麻烦时,看,例如,让我们说我确信这一定是真的,你们有些人,让我们说你有一个非常亲密的朋友,她和你经常互相交谈,我想我现在想的是两个女性朋友,你有没有注意到,例如,你们都经历了职业失望,她对此还好,你有点被摧毁了,但你们也都经历了浪漫失望,对吧,类似的失望,出于某种奇怪的原因,她更被摧毁了,你还好,这里发生了什么,我告诉你发生了什么,看,你与成功同床,你在灵性上与它睡在一起,这就是为什么当它从你身上被拿走时你无法接受它,而她也许在灵性上与浪漫同床,你看,看,我们都在与某物同床,但你能判断的方法通常是当它被拿走时,我的意思是这里有四个人在餐厅,他们都在喝一杯葡萄酒,曾经是酒精中毒者,你怎么知道,你怎么知道谁是酒精中毒者,你怎么知道谁对葡萄酒上瘾,不是不是当他们都有酒时,这不是判断的方法,因为你看那些没有上瘾的人也在喝酒,你判断的方法是把它从他们那里拿走,把它拿走,说你不能拥有任何东西,你看,缺乏成瘾物质才是真正告诉你你上瘾的,对我们大多数人来说,我们意识到我们对情人神上瘾的唯一方法,这些我们感到对它们有致命吸引力的情人神,我们感觉我们必须拥有的某物,是当出了问题时,你看,这里有一个可怕的挑战,我已经想过这个很多次了,你看,神来说,你为自己做的神在哪里呢,你遭遇患难的时候叫他们起来拯救你吧,当然他们不能,我在这里会很直率,如果你把你的生活建立在你的配偶上,她把她的生活建立在你身上,你知道如果你是一个男人,你们中的一个总有一天会看到另一个躺在棺材里,这就是神所说的,你为自己做的神在哪里呢,如果你把你的生活建立在她身上,她怎么可能在最需要的时刻拯救你,她不能,让我给你一个非常不同的观点,但它真的是一样的,如果你把你的生活建立在你是一个有道德的正派人这个想法上,因此它是你的道德标准,你珍贵的道德标准,你的我是一个好人的感觉真的是给你意义和价值的东西,当你跌倒时会发生什么,当你失误时会发生什么,当你搞砸时会发生什么,道德正直之神如何在你刚刚搞砸时拯救你,你说这就是为什么你的内疚,你的内疚会降临到你身上,神在哪里,是当你遇到麻烦时,当你的心碎时,你才意识到我建立生活的东西不可能拯救我,这就是成瘾循环,现在最后这里有一个非凡的恢复计划,首先我们看到灵性吸引的动态,灵性成瘾的动态,我们提升的那些东西我们对它们上瘾,然后我们上瘾的那些东西在我们最需要的时候抛弃我们,看,它们是无价值的,最后我们感到无价值,它在第5节中说,现在这是最后一点,我们如何避免致命的吸引,我们如何做到这一点,我们如何保持,我们如何从情人神的床上下来,你知道我在这里根本不是歧视,我要对基督徒朋友说话,但让我对我的让我对一些坚实的忠诚成熟的基督徒说话,无论你是谁,你知道谁敢认为我在对你说话,现在但无论如何你,但你们有些人在那里,让我告诉你一些事情,你所有的问题都来自这个,无论你是强大的基督徒还是软弱的基督徒或根本不是基督徒,这都是你生活的地图,你的情人神,每当你感到过度的愤怒或过度的恐惧或过度的内疚,甚至过度的无聊,你总能通过问两个问题找出原因,你总能到达底部,为什么我感觉,有什么,你可以这样说,有什么让我觉得我必须拥有,否则我就死了,没有意义,没有价值,它是什么让我觉得我绝对必须拥有,第二个问题是更多的是什么,现在什么比耶稣基督更像我真正的救主,我的意思是这就是你生活的地图,现在你的情人神,现在你要如何处理它们,有一个很棒的计划,我们被告知三件事,我必须有点简短,但我想让你看到它们,如果你想克服这些致命的吸引,如果你想在这里获得自由,这就是你如何做,第一件事是个性化你对罪的理解,和我一起阅读第1-3节,或者实际上只是第2和3节,主说我记得你幼年的恩爱,你作新妇的时候怎样爱我,在旷野,在未曾耕种之地怎样跟随我,那时以色列归耶和华为圣,作为初熟的果子,凡吞吃它的必算为有罪,灾祸必临到他们,现在这就是我所说的词汇的意思,这就是词汇问题,如果你只把罪理解为违反神的律法,如果这是你对罪的基本理解,这就是你要做的,你会成为一个责骂者,责骂SCOLD,当你犯罪时你会责骂自己,当别人犯罪时你会责骂他们,你在违反律法,我对责骂唯一知道的一件事是这样的,任何你责骂做X的人都想做更多的X,比他以前想做的更多,甚至你自己,你责骂你的心,你的心会想做更多,你们有些人这些年来你所做的就是这样,你有这些你想克服的东西,你有这些你想改变的东西,你所做的就是责骂你的心,你在违反神的律法,这改变了我们的词汇,我应该说它丰富了词汇,因为这就是文本告诉我们的,罪是打破神的心,我能表达它的最生动的方式之一是这样的,你们有些人经历过所有辅导员都会告诉你的最终心理折磨,可能发生在人类身上的最糟糕的事情,最有压力的事情是离婚,甚至你知道,对吧,尤其是当你把自己交给的人,你使自己对他们脆弱,拒绝你,背离你,甚至可能把他或她自己放在别人的怀抱中,现在那种痛苦我认为可能是存在的最糟糕的痛苦,但即使我们不想把这个愿望强加给任何人,那是一件可怕的事情,我知道这个房间里有人经历过,但你知道我们在这里学到的是,如果你经历过那种婚姻痛苦,那正是神的感受,你会深入了解神,直到你理解那就是神对罪的感受,你才理解罪,直到你理解,看看,看这种语言,这种蜜月语言,你知道在第2和3节,他正在将他与我们的关系描绘为两只恋爱中的鸟,事实上它几乎,它几乎是不尊重的,你看,因为一方面他将我们描绘成一个年轻的新娘,她不在乎她嫁给一个没有钱的人的事实,他们要住在某个小洞里,嗯,没关系,他甚至看第3节,他将自己描绘成一种年轻人,他只是要揍任何对我的女孩斜眼看的人,你看这个,你说这两只恋爱中的鸟,没关系,重要的只是他们拥有彼此,现在为什么神会在某种意义上使用这样一个不配的例证,因为他的心就是这样,圣经告诉我们,即使神是完全圣洁的,完全威严的,在他的存在中他不需要我们,我们被告知神自愿做了完全相反的事情,这是性意象的另一面,他使自己对我们脆弱,他关心我们,他把他的心与我们绑在一起,在某种意义上他把他的心给了我们,当我们为任何超过神的东西而活时,我们对他做的正是,只是远远超过人们在配偶离开他们时所经历的,你不仅仅是在违反他的律法,你在打破他的心,每当你不把他放在中心时,你就在刺他的心,因为他已经把你放在他心的中心,你像这样理解罪吗,这就是为什么我想让你知道这个,对我们中的一些人来说,我们从未真正能够改变的原因是因为我们所做的就是责骂我们的心,但这会融化你的心,你必须看,你必须向下看,直到你看到神所做的是他把他的心给了我们,你知道因为他比我们强大得多,比我们更有爱心得多,比我们更明智得多,你知道,这一定意味着他也比我们遭受更多的痛苦,无限多,我的意思是我见过一些人,我有一些非常亲密的朋友经历过这种拒绝,你使自己完全脆弱,你把自己放在别人的怀抱中,他们拒绝了你,他们去了某个地方,他们把自己放在别人的怀抱中,这没有发生在我身上,当我看到其他人经历的是什么时,甚至关心那样的人都是毁灭性的,然而神,它说我正在经历比那种最糟糕的经历无限大的东西,如果你经历过那个,至少你对神如何看待我们有一点了解,他关心我们,他爱我们,直到你个性化你对罪的看法,你的心不会被融化,当你听它时的奉献是关于这个用个人化的融化你的心,个性化你对罪的理解,其次记住恩典,看第5和6节,第5节说耶和华如此说,你们的列祖见我有什么不义,竟远离我,好吧,但第6节他们也不说那领我们从埃及地上来,让我们做男爵旷野,经过沙漠有深坑之地,干旱黑暗之地的耶和华在哪里呢,他们陷入偶像崇拜的原因是他们在灵性上忘记了他们的救赎,他们没有不断地说让我记住他为我做了什么,你可以处理情人神的第二种方法是你必须在灵性上使耶稣为你所做的成为现实,在指环王中有一个地方,我最喜欢的小说,霍比特人皮平站在城市的大门,进来的是伟大的巫妖王,恶魔王,他穿过大门,他将要摧毁城市,突然在远处号角,基本上是骑兵的号角,洛汉骑士的号角,他们已经来了,即使洛汗国王那天骑马赴死,城市得救了,我们被告知皮平的余生,每当他听到远处的号角声,都会泪流满面,为什么,因为每次他听到远处的号角声,它重新唤醒了他得救的记忆和为他而死的人的记忆,现在你如何听远处的号角,你的远处号角是什么,圣礼,当你领受主的晚餐时,基督徒朋友来敬拜,但除非看你陷入情人神的怀抱,当你停止说那领我做这个和这个和这个的耶和华在哪里呢,当你你需要记住恩典,你需要找到使它在灵性上对你真实的方法,你需要找到这样做的方法,你不能只是你不能被动,第5节发生是因为第6节没有发生,所以首先个性化你的观点,其次记住恩典,但最后看镜子,第32节,这是一节了不起的经文,耶利米不可能知道我们对它的了解,处女岂能忘记她的妆饰呢,更亮的婚礼装饰品,我的百姓却忘记了我无数的日子,现在婚礼礼服的功能是什么,新娘在婚礼那天你想要完美,事实上你在婚礼那天并不完美,你想要恰到好处的尺寸,你在婚礼那天不是合适的尺寸,你想要你知道完美无瑕,你并不完美无瑕,但婚礼装饰品和婚纱和化妆有些东西从来没有一个不完美的新娘,这就是为什么它们如此重要,但在我多年做婚礼的所有年份中,我从未见过一个新娘到达过道顶部说我没有化妆,每个人都说哦,你是对的,见鬼不,你知道为什么,因为你的新娘总是照镜子,我的意思是一整天你都在照镜子,你来,我的意思是你能想象一个新娘到达过道顶部说我忘了照我的镜子,我没有戴面纱或我没有这第三个那个,不会发生,现在神不仅说天哪,神不只是说就像你使用你的婚礼装饰品来隐藏你的身体畸形,使自己在身体上看起来完美,所以我会给你一些会使你在灵性上美丽和灵性上的东西,他不说我会给你什么东西,他说什么,处女岂能忘记她的妆饰呢,处女岂能忘记她的婚礼装饰品,我的百姓却忘记了我,现在他说这个,这是我的承诺,我可以使你在灵性上完美和美丽,你在那里工作如此辛苦的原因,你在那里如此不安的原因,你想要你的孩子完美的原因,你想要某人爱你的人是完美的原因,你工作如此疯狂的原因,你在尝试,你在尝试遮盖自己,你在尝试放置装饰品,你在尝试使自己在灵性上美丽,在灵性上可接受,神实际上走得如此之远,说我不只是要给你一些使你在灵性上可接受的东西,我就是那个,我可以成为那个为你,只有耶利米无法理解,但我们知道,那就是耶稣基督不只是来死使我们被赦免,耶稣基督来了,我们在以弗所书5中被告知,要把我们呈现为无瑕疵和光辉的新娘,他来为我们成为完美,他说施洗约翰在他受洗的那天,施洗约翰说你不需要受洗,你没有罪,耶稣说什么,他说我必须实现公义,当然他不是为自己做一切完美的,他已经完美了,他正在为我们过完美的生活,这样当相信他时,他美丽的记录被放在我们身上,我们要爱我们的神的原因是我们试图说服自己我们在灵性上是美丽的,神说如果你照镜子看自己,如果你愿意看到我为你所做的,如果你理解因为我的儿子为你所做的你在我眼中是多么美丽,你将永远从你最少的情人神中获得自由,你知道这样的歌,你看我要起来去耶稣,他会在他的怀抱中拥抱我,在我亲爱的救主的怀抱中,哦,有一万个魅力,去学习那意味着什么,让我们祈祷,谢谢你父亲,当我们看这段经文时,它给我们的灵魂的深刻分析,以及它给我们的完整的更新和恢复计划,我们感谢你,现在我们有可能通过了解你对我们的爱而融化我们的心,通过记住你对我们的恩典而维持和改变我们的心,最重要的是,通过了解你的儿子不仅为我们做了什么,而且你的儿子为我们是什么而完全改变,主,这些事情非常非常,它们很深刻,它们很美好,如果我们中的一些人以前从未听说过这个,因为这里今天有些人甚至从未听说过这种对基督教的理解,我们祈祷父亲,以前多次听过它的我们,三位一体的圣灵你会以从未有过的方式变得活跃,对于我们中那些以前从未听说过的人,这只是旅程的第一步的开始,它将在你的怀抱中结束,现在父亲给我们你想给我们的,给我们你自己,我们奉耶稣的名祈祷,阿门,感谢你今天的教导,我们祈祷你受到鼓励,它帮助你将福音应用到你的生活中并与他人分享,要从Tim

欢迎来到生命中的福音。为什么这个世界如此破碎？为什么我们能够造成如此大的伤害，甚至对我们所爱的人？人们将其归咎于政治、贫困或心理学，但这些都不能完全解释我们在自己和历史中看到的一切。本月在播客中，提摩太·凯勒将教导一个系列，探讨这个问题：我们到底出了什么问题？

认识圣经关于罪的教导如何提供了唯一足够深刻的解释，以面对其全部复杂性的真相，以及唯一足够强大的盼望来改变我们。耶利米书2章1到8节和23到32节。它印在那里。这是先知耶利米书中这伟大篇章的开头和结尾。耶和华的话临到我说，你去向耶路撒冷人的耳中宣告说，我记得你幼年的恩爱，你作新妇的爱情，你怎样在旷野跟随我，在未曾耕种之地跟随我，以色列归耶和华为圣，作为他收成的初熟之物，凡吞吃他的必算为有罪，灾祸必临到他们，这是耶和华说的。

雅各家，以色列家的各族啊，你们当听耶和华的话。耶和华如此说，你们的列祖见我有什么不义，竟远离我，随从虚无的神，自己成为虚妄？他们也不说，那领我们从埃及地上来，引导我们经过旷野，经过沙漠和深坑之地，经过干旱和死荫之地，经过无人经过、无人居住之地的耶和华在哪里呢？我领你们进入肥美之地，使你们得吃其中的果子和美物，但你们进入的时候，就玷污了我的地，使我的产业成为可憎的。

祭司都不说，耶和华在哪里呢？传讲律法的都不认识我，官长违背我，先知藉巴力说预言，随从无益的神。你怎能说，我没有玷污，我没有随从众巴力？你看你在谷中的行动，就知道你所行的如何。你是快行的独峰驼，狂奔乱走。你是野驴，惯在旷野，欲心发动就吸风，起性的时候谁能使它转去呢？凡寻找它的必不至疲乏，

交配的时候他们会找到她。不要奔跑直到你的脚光秃秃、你的喉咙干涸，但你说，没有用。我爱外邦的神，我必须去追随他们。盗贼被抓时怎样蒙羞，以色列家也照样蒙羞，他们的君王、官长、祭司和先知都是如此。

他们对木头说你是我的父亲，对石头说你生了我，他们以背向我，不以面向我，及至遭遇患难的时候却说，起来拯救我们。你为自己做的那些神在哪里呢？你遭遇患难的时候，叫他们起来拯救你吧，犹大啊，你神的数目与你城的数目相等。你们为何与我争辩呢？你们都背叛了我，这是耶和华说的。我责罚你们的儿女是徒然的，他们不受惩治，你们的刀吞灭你们的先知，好像残害的狮子。

你们这世代的人哪，当听耶和华的话。我岂向以色列作旷野呢？或作幽暗之地呢？我的百姓为何说，我们脱离约束，再不归向你了？处女岂能忘记她的妆饰呢？新妇岂能忘记她的美衣呢？我的百姓却忘记了我，日子无数。这是神的话语。

我们难以谈论罪和邪恶的原因之一，即便我们需要谈论，因为我们过去有些事情让我们隐约感到内疚，我们看到人们对我们或在世界上做的事情，我们对此感到道德上的愤怒，然而我们被社会教导说，使用罪或邪恶这个词是压迫性的或无意义的，然而我们感觉到有些东西存在，但我们没有词汇来表达它。现在我们在这个系列中要做的事情从上周开始，我们要去查考圣经，因为圣经给了我们一个更加丰富的关于罪的词汇，它帮助我们以我们社会中大多数人所不具备的方式来理解罪。

它是如此丰富，它是如此细致入微。例如，上周我们看到罪是贬低神，其结果是灵里的狭小。这周我们将看到罪是取代神，其结果是灵里的成瘾。这是耶利米对一个处在属灵危机中的国家的预言

衰落，我们在这里看到的是，他告诉我们三件事，他告诉我们关于我们所说的灵性吸引的动力、灵性成瘾的动力和灵性恢复的动力。我想当我们接近结尾时，你会明白我所说的是什么意思，当涉及到思考罪和邪恶时，这如何丰富了我们的词汇，以及这在实践上是多么重要，但让我们开始吧。首先，他向我们展示了灵性吸引的动力。

在整个经文中，他使用了非凡的性意象。有一节经文我没有列出来，我试图说好吧，我不能打印整章，但从某种意义上说，我们正在查看整章，有一节经文非常非常有趣。看第4-8节，我们确实打印了，我们被告知上帝正在责备他们，因为他们转向偶像，他们敬拜其他神，他们不敬拜他。第1-3节他使用了，我们会回到这一点，非凡的性意象，描述一对年轻的已婚夫妇无可救药地相爱，在最后我们将会看到，但在第20节——这是我没有打印但应该打印的——在第20节有一节经文是这样开始的，它是这样说的：在每一座高山上，在每一棵蔓延的栗树下，在每一棵蔓延的树下，你，现在我们说好吧，那是偶像崇拜，因为我们知道在每一座高山上他们都有巴力的祭坛，在每一棵蔓延的树下都有巴力的祭坛，为什么呢，因为祭坛是超越的标志，高山是超越的标志，蔓延的树木是生育力的标志，所以在第20节你看到这句话是这样开始的：在每一座高山上，在每一棵蔓延的树下，你会想这句话会以"你敬拜偶像"结束，但它不是这么说的，它说的是：在每一座高山上，在每一棵蔓延的树下，你张开你的双腿，现在我不知道你手里拿的是什么版本，但我可以告诉你一件事，无论你拿的是什么英文版本，如果你手里有圣经，你看看，我知道它不是这么说的，无论是钦定版还是RSV版还是新国际版本还是其他任何版本，它都

不会这样说，但希伯来文里确实是这样字面表达的，有趣的是，一般来说，翻译者觉得我们太敏感了或者什么的，无法真正听到上帝试图告诉我们的话，上帝说的是，当你崇拜偶像、崇拜别神时，他说在每座山顶上，在每棵树下，你都在张开双腿，那么他为什么会使用这种意象呢，他只是想，你知道，引起我们的注意吗，他只是想，你知道，这只是为了震撼效果吗，不，这是为了教导价值，因为这是他在这里一直在教导的，为什么在整本圣经中，当上帝谈到敬拜他时，他如此频繁地使用性意象，而当他谈到敬拜其他任何东西或敬拜时，常常在性意象的范畴下使用，上帝为什么要这样做呢，这就是他在做的，他在说此刻在灵性层面上，在你心里正在发生一种吸引，这种吸引的力量完全等同于身体层面上可能发生的性吸引，换句话说，他现在在说你的灵魂深处正在发生某些事情，在你灵魂最深的隐秘处，你正在灵性上与某些东西躺卧，你正在灵性上投入某些东西的怀抱，而你与那东西的灵性关系的力量完全等同于身体关系的力量，而且是性关系，现在想一想身体吸引力，一方面身体吸引力相当压倒性，事实上我们大多数人可能会说我们生命中最尴尬的时刻，只有你们自己知道这些时刻是什么，我们生命中最尴尬的时刻是那些身体吸引力压倒了即将到来的常识、压倒了智慧、压倒了良心的时刻，但是什么使得身体吸引力如此强大，它只是情感上的迷恋吗，现在这里是我要转向生物学家的地方，因为实际上耶利米转向了生物学家，我通常不这样做，一般来说我不会去找一个生物学家说告诉我性本能是什么，我通常不喜欢

我所听到的，事实上你也不会，大多数人都不会，但这很耐人寻味，耶利米将我们比作——这确实相当有力——将我们比作某个时刻的动物，不仅仅是像第二章开头和结尾那样比作新妇，而是在这中间部分他说，看看你在山谷中的行为，你就像一只快速奔跑的母骆驼，到处乱窜，像一头习惯于沙漠的野驴，在她的渴望中、在她的发情期嗅着风。现在生物学家会告诉你，为什么生理欲望、为什么性欲如此重要，这就是：从集体的角度来说，除非我们找到其他人，否则我们就会死亡，我们无法繁殖自己。生物学家会告诉你这一点，生物学家会说，除非你是哥斯拉，对于其他每一个物种来说都是如此，雄性体内有一些只有雄性才能产生的东西，必须与雌性产生的东西结合在一起，否则你的种族就会结束，你的物种就会结束，你就会结束。因此生物学家会告诉你，这种令人难以置信的生理吸引力的一个重大根源是：从集体的角度来说，单独的雄性或雌性本身是不完整的，它们已经死了，除非你们真正结合在一起。这当然是显而易见的，动物没有任何情感，然而生理吸引力却极其强大，我们可以说没有情感参与，哦，它从哪里来？它来自这样一个事实：从生物学角度来说，我们在集体上是不完整的。好的，现在为什么要用这种强有力的性意象？原因在这里：这段经文，这段文本根本不是在谈论以色列的性行为，它根本不是在谈论性伦理，它在谈论宗教。你知道很有意思，在圣马可广场金氏音像对面有一个故事说"宗教性"（religious sex），这非常引人注目，把某样东西称为"宗教性"是一种前卫和酷的做法，为什么？因为在我们的思想中，宗教和性是两件完全不同的事情，它们是完全对立的，所以把它们放在一起有点让你震撼，对吧？这就是他们选择它的原因。这是圣马可广场，你知道的，我们很前卫，我们与众不同，我们

令人震惊的是，神早就说过这个了。耶利米在2500年前就说过这个，他们说的是什么呢？在你的灵魂深处，有一种属灵的渴望，它比那些构成身体吸引力的欲望更加强大。这个渴望就是：你无法自己产生生命的意义，你无法靠自己产生自己的价值，你无法产生自己的安全感。每个人都必须在生活中拥有某种意义，否则生活就是空虚的；每个人都必须得到对你价值的肯定，否则你就会感到毫无价值；每个人都必须拥有某种安全感，否则你无法面对生活。但你无法自己产生这些，就像你无法繁衍自己的物种、无法创造你自己的生命一样。你无法在属灵层面上自我繁衍，就像你无法在身体上完全靠自己繁衍一样。你不能只是说"对我来说唯一重要的就是我喜欢我自己"——你永远无法通过那种方式获得你的价值。你不能说"我只是要为我自己的快乐而活"——你永远无法通过那种方式获得你的意义。必须有某种在你之外的东西，作为你意义的源头、你价值的源头、你安全感的源头。你渴望那个，你需要那个，你需要抓住那个——无论那是什么——某件东西、某个人、某种追求、某种关系、某个目标、某种状况、某种实践。你无力在你的心中产生意义、价值和安全感，就像你在身体上无法自我繁衍生命一样。所以从属灵层面来说，如果不是神作为你灵魂的爱人，如果你不是在属灵上投入神的怀抱，如果不是神的意义作为你意义的源头、神的肯定作为你自我价值的源头、神的能力作为你安全感的源头，如果不是神，那么你在属灵上就是与某种东西在一起。你已经把自己交给了某种东西，在如此深刻、如此深远的层面上，以至于神在这里说，你在属灵上完全依赖于它，就像你在身体上完全依赖一样。你在属灵上完全展现、完全摊开、完全脆弱地面对它，就像你在与某人发生性关系时在身体上的脆弱一样。你在做着完全相同的事。

在属灵上你与某些东西的关系，就像在床上与某人发生肉体关系一样——你必须拥有它，你在属灵上是不完整的，因此你与某些东西"同床共枕"。现在让我们先停下来，在继续之前，让我向你展示这种关于灵魂和精神的观点与你在巴诺书店灵魂和精神专区所读到或听到的有多么根本的不同。那个专区每年都在扩大，有大量关于灵魂、灵魂的照料、灵魂的帮助、心灵鸡汤或精神——你知道的，照顾精神的书籍。如果你去拿下那些书，它们都非常非常不同，但它们又都是一样的。首先，它们把灵魂描绘成一个池塘，一种平静的湖泊，但圣经把灵魂描绘成一个不安的、汹涌的海洋。或者每当他们谈论——所有这些书谈论灵魂的治愈或灵魂的照料时，他们通常都在说要进入安静的地方，思考它，思考鼓舞人心的想法，反思——你看，要安静——看，灵魂就是那样的东西。而圣经说的要强健得多，强健得多，活力得多，真实得多——你的灵魂是两只空荡荡的臂膀，你的灵魂是一颗完全空虚的心，你必须追逐事物来填满它。灵魂说我无法控制，我必须追逐它们——看，对你的灵魂的处理方式完全不同。你的灵魂不只是需要被抚慰，拍拍它——你的灵魂需要爱，你的灵魂需要狂喜，你的灵魂需要激情。好吧，但它也给了我们一个完全不同的观点——不仅是关于灵魂，而且是关于上帝的完全不同的观点。如果你拿下那些书，如果它们真的谈论上帝——它们中的许多根本不谈——但如果它们真的谈论上帝，它们谈论上帝是某种给予平安的存在，某种遥远的力量、一种能量。而这里的上帝说，我不只是一个遥远的力量，事实上我不只是一个你要服从的主权者。让我告诉你我为什么造了你——我想成为你灵魂的爱人，我想成为你心的中心。看，他在说——看那性行为，看那最伟大的

狂喜的性爱，那只是你我灵魂之间的契合将会是什么样子的一个微弱暗示，那就是我创造你的目的，那就是我想要你与我同在的方式。你知道吗，我的意思是，你知道有很多人进入其中，他们认为这很棒，这种对灵魂的探讨，现代的新时代灵性，他们就这样说，这似乎很酷，似乎很前卫，你看，这似乎比人们对基督教那种刻板机械的理解要好得多。但真正的基督教，看看我们所看到的，看看我们所谈论的，这种对灵魂的看法，这种对上帝的看法，上帝说我想要你，我的臂膀驱动着属灵吸引力的动力，他说如果我不在你的臂弯里，如果你不在我的臂弯里，你就在某个事物的臂弯里。现在我们学到的第二件事，我会简短地讲，因为你们很多人都知道这个，而且你们更想知道的是——我很擅长告诉你们自己有什么问题，你们有些人会说我以前听过这部分，我想知道该怎么办。所以让我简短地说，我们在这里学到的第二件事也是属灵成瘾的动态，因为上帝说的是，如果你的臂弯里没有我，如果你在其他任何事物的臂弯里，你就有大麻烦了，你实际上处于一个成瘾循环中。让我简短地向你展示这个循环是如何运作的。首先，循环的第一部分是你抬举某样东西，看这里第27节，他们说"你是我的父"，对着石头说"你生了我"，然后你说好吧，你是我的父，你生了我。现在有些人会说，好吧，你是什么意思？如果你不敬拜上帝，如果他不是你生命的中心，如果他不是你心灵的中心，如果他不是你最大的喜乐，如果你与他没有那种亲密关系，那么我就是在转向其他神。那你是什么意思？当你想到偶像崇拜和假神时，通常会想到罪。看，现在我们要丰富你的词汇了——木头有什么罪恶的吗？石头有什么罪恶的吗？没有。假神、偶像不是罪，它们可能会引导你去犯罪。

罪，但它们不是罪，它们是好东西，是有创造力的东西。但你看，你所注视的，你所提升的，你把它们放在了你生命中最高的位置，你对它们说什么？你造了我，你定义了我，你是我的父。看，当你看着某人说"宝贝，没有你我算什么"时，你是在对某个可能非常非常好的东西说：你是我的父，你是我的救主，你是我的创造者。我们到处都看到破碎、战争、残酷和心痛。我们在周围的世界和自己的生活中感受到它。这是怎么发生的？对此能做些什么？在他本月即将发行的全新著作《这个世界怎么了》中，提姆·凯勒给出了一个清晰而富有同情心的答案。该书取材于在救赎主教会的一系列教导，凯勒博士展示了罪的现实如何解释我们周围看到的痛苦，以及只有福音才能提供持久的自由和医治。无论你是被我们世界的状况所压倒，还是在与自己的错误或选择挣扎，或是在寻找希望和喜乐，《这个世界怎么了》都会帮助你看到福音如何既回应我们世界的心痛，也回应我们每个人内心的痛苦。这本新发行的书《这个世界怎么了》是我们对你本月帮助"福音与生命"分享耶稣好消息的奉献的感谢。今天就在gospel and life.com slash give索取你的副本，地址是gospel and life.com slash give。现在是凯勒博士今天教导的其余部分。

这是第一步，第一步是你拿了某样好东西——木头、石头——某样好东西，不是罪，然后你提升它，你说：你是我的父，你是我的创造者，没有你我就没有定义。这是第一件事。但接下来，第二，我们看到这导致了成瘾。它说你无法被约束。看，这里说得很直白，很哀怨，第25节说："不要跑到你的脚光秃，你的喉咙干渴"，主说，你为什么跑？你的脚光秃意味着你的鞋已经磨穿了，你的喉咙干渴，你正因喉咙干渴而死，你在沙漠中奔跑。当然，这是一件可怕的事情，你永远不应该在沙漠中奔跑，这就是这里所描绘的场景。

但她说没用，但你说没用，我必须，现在"必须"这个词就是一切。任何你决定的事情，就像我之前说的，如果上帝不是你生命的中心，那么一定有别的东西是，对吧？可能是工作、事业、职位和成就，可能是美丽、爱情和浪漫，可能是金钱、财产和舒适，可能是亚当·斯密的市场无形之手，可能是黑格尔的世界精神，或者可能是棒球，可能是橄榄球，可能是你的音乐，我是说你知道的，可能是你的独立性，可能是某个极其崇高的事业，某个你正在为之奋斗反对不公正的事业，可能是任何东西。但当你说"你定义了我，你是我的意义，没有你我就没有意义，通过获得你，你让我感觉我有价值，否则我就没有价值，我必须拥有这些东西"——那么你就对它们上瘾了，你必须拥有它们。你知道判断你是否对某样东西上瘾的最好方法，不是——这就是经文所说的——不是在事情顺利的时候，而是在你遇到麻烦的时候。你看第27、28节，最快的判断方法是当你遇到麻烦的时候。比如说，我相信这对你们某些人来说一定是真实的，假设你有一个非常亲密的朋友，她和你经常互相交谈，我想我现在想的是两个女性朋友。你有没有注意到，比如你们俩都经历了职业上的失望，她对此还好，而你却有点崩溃；但你们俩也都经历过爱情上的失望，对吧？类似的失望，但出于某种奇怪的原因，她更崩溃，而你却还好。这是怎么回事呢？我告诉你这是怎么回事。你看，你在灵性上与成功同床共枕，这就是为什么当它从你身边被夺走时，你无法承受。而她可能在灵性上与爱情同床共枕，你明白吗？我们都在灵性上与某样东西同床共枕，但判断的方法通常是当它被夺走的时候。我的意思是，这里有四个人在餐厅里，他们都在喝一杯酒，其中一个是酒鬼。你怎么知道？你怎么发现谁是

酒鬼，你怎么知道谁对酒上瘾呢？不是在他们都在喝酒的时候，那不是判断的方法，因为你看那些没有上瘾的人也在喝酒。你判断的方法是把酒从他们那里拿走，拿走并说你不能再喝了。你看，正是成瘾物质的缺失才真正告诉你你上瘾了。对我们大多数人来说，我们意识到自己沉迷于那些"情人神"——那些我们被强烈吸引的"情人神"，那些我们觉得必须拥有的东西——唯一的方式就是当出问题的时候。你看，这里有一个可怕的挑战，我已经想过很多次了。你看，神来了，说："你为自己所造的神在哪里呢？让它们来吧，看它们能否在你遭难时拯救你。"当然它们不能。让我很直白地说，如果你把生命建立在你的配偶身上，她把生命建立在你身上，你知道如果你是男人，你们中的一个总有一天会看到另一个躺在棺材里。这就是神在说的："你为自己所造的神在哪里呢？"如果你把生命建立在她身上，她怎么可能在你最需要的时刻拯救你？她不能。让我给你一个非常不同但实际上相同的观点：如果你把生命建立在这样一个想法上——你是一个有道德的、体面的人，因此你的道德标准，你宝贵的道德标准和你认为"我是个好人"的感觉，才真正给你意义和价值，那么当你跌倒时会发生什么？当你失足时会发生什么？当你搞砸时会发生什么？当你刚刚搞砸的时候，道德正直之神怎么能拯救你呢？你会说这就是为什么你的罪疚感，你的罪疚感会压倒你："神在哪里呢？"正是当你陷入困境时，当你心碎时，你才意识到我所建立生命的那些东西根本不可能拯救我。这就是成瘾的循环。最后，这里有一个了不起的恢复计划。首先，我们看到了属灵吸引的动力机制，属灵成瘾的动力机制，这些东西

我们推崇的那些东西，我们对它们上瘾，然后这些我们上瘾的东西在我们最需要的时候抛弃了我们，看，它们毫无价值，最终我们感到自己也毫无价值，这在第五节中说到。现在，这是最后一点，我们如何避免这些致命的吸引？我们如何做到？我们如何保持，我们如何与情人神分手？你知道吗，我在这里并不是有所偏袒，我要对基督徒朋友说话，但让我也对一些坚定、委身、成熟的基督徒说话，无论你是谁，你知道谁敢认为我在对你说话，不管怎样，但是你们当中有一些人，让我告诉你一件事，你所有的问题都来自于此。无论你是强壮的基督徒、软弱的基督徒，还是根本不是基督徒，这都是你生命的地图——你的情人神，每当你感到过度的愤怒、过度的恐惧、过度的内疚，甚至过度的无聊时，你总能找出原因，你总能通过问两个问题找到根源：为什么我有这种感觉？有什么东西让你可以这样说：有什么东西让我觉得我必须拥有它，否则我就完了，没有意义，没有价值？是什么让我觉得我绝对必须拥有它？第二个问题是：什么东西现在正在发挥作用，比耶稣基督更像是我真正的救主？我的意思是，这就是你生命的地图，现在是你的情人神。现在你要如何对付它们？有一个美妙的方案，有三件事我们被告知，三件事，我还是要简短一点，但我想让你们看到它们。如果你想克服这些致命的吸引，如果你想在这里获得自由，这就是你该做的。第一件事是将你对罪的理解个人化。和我一起读第一到三节，实际上只是第二和第三节。我记得主说：你年轻时的忠诚，你如何像新娘一样爱我，跟随我穿过沙漠，穿过一片未播种的土地。以色列对主来说是圣洁的，是他收成的初熟果子。所有吞吃她的人都被判有罪，灾难临到他们。现在，这就是我所说的词汇问题的意思，这里有一个词汇问题，如果你理解罪

仅仅是违背上帝的律法，如果那是你对罪的基本理解，那么你会做什么呢？你会成为一个责骂者，责骂者（SCOLD），当你犯罪时你会责骂自己，当别人犯罪时你会责骂他们——你在违背律法。关于责骂，我只知道一件事：任何被你责骂做X的人，会比以前更想做X，甚至你自己也是如此。你责骂你的心，你的心就会更想去做那件事。你们有些人这些年来一直就是这样做的，你有这些想要克服的东西，你有这些想要改变的事情，而你所做的就是责骂你的心——你在违背上帝的律法。这改变了我们的词汇，我应该说它丰富了词汇，因为经文告诉我们的是：罪是伤害上帝的心。我能表达的最生动的方式之一就是这样：你们有些人经历过所有辅导员都会告诉你的是终极心理折磨——最糟糕的事情，对人类来说最有压力的事情就是离婚，你知道的，对吧？特别是当那个你把自己交给他、让自己对他敞开心扉的人拒绝你、转身离开你、甚至可能投入别人怀抱的时候。那种痛苦，我认为可能是最糟糕的痛苦。但是，尽管我们不想把这种经历加在任何人身上——那是一件可怕的事情，我知道这个房间里有人经历过——但你知道吗，我们在这里学到的是，上帝的感受正是如此。如果你经历过那种婚姻的痛苦，你就能洞察上帝的感受。直到你明白上帝对罪的感受就是这样，你才能理解罪。直到你明白——看看这语言，这蜜月的语言，你知道在第二节和第三节，他把他与我们的关系描绘成两只相爱的鸟。事实上，这几乎是不敬的，你看，因为一方面他把我们描绘成一位年轻的新娘，她不在乎她嫁给的是一个没钱的人，他们要去住在一个小破地方，一些它不

这对他来说很重要，甚至看第三节，他把自己描绘成一个年轻人的形象，他会揍任何对我的女孩斜眼看的人，你看着这一切，你会说这两只爱情鸟，什么都不重要，重要的只是他们拥有彼此，现在为什么上帝会在某种意义上使用这样一个不配的例证呢？因为那就是他的心的样子，圣经告诉我们，尽管上帝是完全圣洁的，完全威严的，在他的存在中他并不需要我们，但我们被告知，上帝已经自愿地做了确切的——这里是性意象的另一面——他让自己对我们变得脆弱，他关心我们，他的心与我们紧紧相连，从某种意义上说，他把他的心给了我们，当我们为任何超过上帝的事物而活时，我们对他所做的正是那些配偶离开他们时人们所经历的，只是远远超过，你不仅仅是在违背他的律法，你是在伤他的心，每当你不把他放在中心时，你就是在刺他的心，因为他已经把你放在他心的中心，你明白这样的罪吗？这就是为什么我想让你知道这个，对我们一些人来说，我们从来没能真正改变的原因是因为我们所做的只是责备自己的心，但这会融化你的心，你必须向下看，直到你看到上帝所做的就是他把他的心给了我们，你知道吗？既然他比我们强大无限倍，比我们更有爱无限倍，比我们更有智慧无限倍，那一定意味着他——他——他遭受的痛苦也比我们多无限倍，我是说，我见过一些人，我有一些非常亲密的朋友经历过这种拒绝，你让自己完全脆弱，你把自己放在别人的怀抱里，他们却拒绝了你，他们去了别的地方，他们把自己放在别人的怀抱里，这没有发生在我身上，当我看到别人经历的事情时，这是毁灭性的，甚至去关心某个人到那种程度，然而上帝说，我正在经历比那种最糟糕的经历还要无限更大的东西，如果你经历过那种情况

至少你对上帝如何看待我们有一点了解，他关心我们，他爱我们，直到你将你对罪的看法个人化，你的心才不会被融化。当你听奉献诗时，它是关于用个人化的方式融化你的心，用个人化的方式理解你的罪。其次，记住恩典。看第5节和第6节，第5节说："耶和华如此说：你们的列祖见我有什么不义，竟远离我？"好的，但第6节说："他们也不说：那领我们从埃及地上来，引导我们经过旷野，沙漠和深坑之地，干旱和死荫之地的耶和华在哪里呢？"他们陷入偶像崇拜的原因是他们在灵性上忘记了他们的救赎。他们没有不断地说：让我记住他为我做了什么。你对付假神的第二个方法是，你必须在灵性上让耶稣为你所做的事变得真实。在《指环王》这本我最喜欢的小说中，有一个场景，霍比特人皮平站在城门前，伟大的巫王、恶魔之王进来了，他穿过城门，正要摧毁这座城市，突然远处传来号角声，基本上是骑兵的号角声，洛汗骑士的号角声，他们来了。尽管洛汗国王那天骑马赴死，但城市得救了。我们被告知，在皮平余生中，每当他听到远处的号角声，都会忍不住泪流满面。为什么？因为每次他听到远处的号角声，都会重新唤醒他获救的记忆，以及那位为他而死之人的记忆。那么你如何倾听远处的号角呢？什么是你远处的号角？圣餐，当你领受主的圣餐时，基督徒朋友来敬拜，但除非你看到，当你停止说"那位做了这事和这事的主在哪里"时，你就会落入假神的怀抱。你需要记住恩典，你需要找到让它在灵性上对你变得真实的方法，你需要找到做这些的方法。你不能只是被动地接受。第5节之所以发生，是因为第6节没有发生。所以首先将你的观点个人化，其次

记住恩典，但最后要照照镜子。第32节，这是一节令人惊叹的经文，耶利米不可能知道我们现在对它的理解。"处女岂能忘记她的首饰，新妇岂能忘记她的妆饰？然而我的百姓忘记我，已是无数的日子。"那么，你的婚纱在婚礼当天的作用是什么呢？你想要完美，但事实上你在婚礼那天并不完美。你希望自己恰好是合适的尺寸，但你在婚礼那天并不是合适的尺寸。你想要毫无瑕疵，但你并非毫无瑕疵。然而婚礼装饰、婚纱和化妆有某种魔力，从来没有过不完美的新娘，这就是它们如此重要的原因。但有一件事我在多年主持婚礼中从未见过——我从未见过一位新娘走到过道顶端时说"我没化妆"，然后所有人说"哦，你说得对"。见鬼，当然不会，你知道为什么吗？因为新娘总是在照镜子。我是说一整天你都在照镜子。你能想象一位新娘走到过道顶端说"我忘记照镜子了，我没戴面纱，或者我没有这个那个"吗？这种事不会发生。现在，神不仅仅是说——神不只是说，就像你用婚礼装饰来掩盖你身体上的缺陷，让自己看起来身体上很完美一样，我也会给你某样东西，让你在灵性上美丽，在灵性上——他没有说"我会给你某样东西"，他说的是什么？"处女岂能忘记她的首饰？新妇岂能忘记她的妆饰？然而我的百姓忘记我。"现在他说的是这个，这是我的应许：我能让你在灵性上完美和美丽。你在外面拼命工作的原因，你在外面如此不安的原因，你希望你的孩子完美的原因，你想要某个完美的人爱你的原因，你疯狂工作的原因——你在试图遮掩自己，你在试图佩戴那些装饰，你在试图让自己在灵性上美丽，在灵性上被接纳。而神实际上走得如此之远，说"我是"

不仅仅是给你一些让你在属灵上可以被接纳的东西，我就是，我可以成为你的那位，只有耶利米无法理解，但我们知道，那就是耶稣基督来并不仅仅是为了让我们被赦免而死，耶稣基督来，我们在以弗所书5章被告知，是要将我们呈现为毫无瑕疵、容光焕发的新妇，他来是为了为我们成为完全，施洗约翰在他受洗的那天说，你不需要受洗，你没有罪，耶稣说了什么呢？他说我必须成就公义，当然他不是为自己做每件事都完美，他已经是完美的了，他是为我们活出完美的生命，所以当我们相信他时，他美好的记录就归在我们身上，我们之所以会爱我们的假神，是因为我们试图说服自己在属灵上是美丽的，而神说，如果你在镜子里看自己，如果你愿意看到我为你所做的，如果你明白因着我儿子为你所做的，你在我眼中是多么美丽，你就会永远从你那些次要的偶像神那里得到自由，你知道那首这样唱的歌吗：你看我要起来到耶稣那里，他要用他的双臂拥抱我，在我亲爱的救主怀抱中，哦那里有万千魅力，去明白那是什么意思吧。让我们祷告，父啊，当我们查看这段经文时，为它给我们的对我们灵魂的深刻剖析，以及它给我们的完整的更新和恢复计划，我们感谢你，我们感谢你，现在我们有可能通过认识你对我们的爱来融化我们的心，通过记念你对我们的恩典来维持、改变我们的心，最重要的是，通过认识你的儿子不仅仅为我们所做的，更是你的儿子为我们成为了什么，而被完全改变，主啊，这些事情非常非常，它们很深刻，很奇妙，如果我们中有些人以前从未听过这些，因为今天这里有些人甚至从未听过这种对基督教的理解，我们祈求父啊，对于我们这些以前听过很多次的人，愿你的圣灵以前所未有的方式变得活跃，对于我们这些从未听过的人

这只是一段旅程的开始，第一步，它将在你的怀抱中结束。天父，请赐给我们，赐给我们你想给我们的，将你自己赐给我们，我们奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。感谢你收听今天的教导，我们祷告你能从中受到鼓励，并帮助你将福音应用到生活中，与他人分享。如果想获得更多来自提姆·凯勒的有益资源，请访问gospelandlife.com。在那里，你可以订阅"生命中的福音"季刊。订阅后，你还将获得免费文章、讲道灵修和其他以福音为中心的优质资源。再次提醒，这一切都在gospelandlife.com。你也可以在Facebook、Instagram、YouTube和X上与我们保持联系。今天的讲道录制于1999年。你在福音与生命播客上听到的讲道和演讲都是在1989年至2017年间录制的，当时凯勒博士担任救赎主长老会教会的主任牧师。
