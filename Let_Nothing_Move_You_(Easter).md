Welcome to the Gospel and Life podcast. Do you believe Christ's resurrection is merely a symbol or an actual real historical event? Today, Tim Keller is teaching on why believing in the historical reality of the resurrection  is the only way it will really change you. After you listen to today's teaching, we invite you to go online to gospelandlife.com  and sign up for email updates.

The musicians have heard this three times. And they are so holy that tonight, when they turn off the lights, they're going to glow in the dark. But you don't know what those three things are yet. And so, just to get a little bit of the effulgence of the musicians to get your cut, let's read. First Corinthians 15.

For what I received, I passed on to you as of first importance,  that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,  that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,  and that He appeared to Peter, and then to the twelve. And after that, He appeared to more than 500 of the brothers at the same time,  most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead. And the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep, for since death, came through a man. The resurrection of the dead comes also through a man.

For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. But each in his own turn, Christ the first fruits, then when He comes those who belong to Him,  then the end will come when He hands over the kingdom to God the Father  after He has destroyed all dominion, authority and power, for He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death. Listen, I tell you a mystery. We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed in a flash.

In the twinkle of an eye, at the last trumpet, for the trumpet will sound. The dead will be raised in perishable, and we will be changed. For the perishable must close itself with imperishable, and the mortal with immortality. And when the perishable has been clothed within the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality,  then the saying that is written will come true. Death is swallowed up in victory.

Where O death is your victory, where O death is your sting. The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law, but thanks be to God. He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore my dear brothers stand firm, but nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.

Now, what Paul does here is he answers three questions, and it's a long chapter,  and I've only pulled a couple of pieces out, and you could do worse than to read the whole chapter on Easter Sunday. First Corinthians 15, maybe the great chapter in the whole Bible on the meaning of the resurrection of Jesus. And he answers three questions about Jesus' resurrection. Did he do it? What did it do?

And what should we do about it? See, did it happen, in other words, what did it accomplish, and what should we do about it? Now, those three things hang together, though I'd like to concentrate tonight on the last point. But see, here's how they hang together. First of all, Paul, in the first few verses, tries to explain that if you're going to get the benefits of the resurrection in your life,  if it's really going to make a difference in your life, if it's really going to change you, you have to believe it actually happened.

That's the reason he goes to the trouble in the very beginning of saying,  look, I received. Now, these are technical Greek verbs, actually. He chooses verbs when he says, I received, and I passed on to you. These are verbs that mean I researched, I got information, and I passed it on. I talked to the eyewitnesses.

I talked to 500. He says, 500 Christians who are still alive when I'm writing this, which is 20 years after Jesus' death and resurrection,  who are still there, you can still go and ask them. See, when Paul makes this sort of public claim in a publicly circulated letter, when he says, look, there are 500 witnesses, go and talk to them if you want. They all saw Jesus at once after he had been raised from the dead. What is Paul doing?

He was saying, it matters. It matters whether you believe it really happened. The average person in New York City believes the resurrection is a wonderful concept. It's a symbol. It's a symbol of good triumphing over bad.

It's a symbol that you can have a new start after a disaster. If you want a little example of it, of that view of the resurrection, it's the New York Times lead editorial today. It says, well, Christians have always celebrated the fact that here was a man who stood against tyranny. Since Christians are not supposed to be sensitive, that would be an insult and therefore it's not. But if we were sensitive, it would be an insult.

Paul goes to great pains and says, if you have a comfortable little life, the symbol of the resurrection,  meaning just how good things overcome bad things eventually, might be a some comfort. In your life with concrete trouble, concrete trials, concrete, real death coming at you,  unless you believe in a concrete, real physical, literal, historical resurrection, you're not going to be any different. You're not going to be able to handle real trouble unless you believe in a real resurrection. You can't believe the resurrection is just a beautiful symbol but didn't happen literally or physically. Paul goes out of his way to say, like in verse 20, but Christ has risen indeed.

That's why we say, not just he's risen, indeed he's risen, really risen, actually risen. His body rekindled and he walked out. And Paul's here saying, the reason he lays all these verses down in the very beginning is,  he says unless you believe it, it's not going to change you. That's the first point. Now, the second point is not only does he say, you have to believe it happen,  but he also says, you have to believe or have to understand what it accomplished.

The resurrection isn't just something that happened. It's not just a naked display of power, it accomplishes something. And what is it accomplish? Well, there's two things that Paul says happen, the resurrection accomplishes. The first one, he says in verse 17, which I didn't print there unfortunately,  where Paul says, if Christ has not raised from the dead, you're still in your sins.

In fact, he says it in a very vivid way. He says, if Christ is still in the ground, you are still in your sins. Why would that be? Because the resurrection proves that something is over. What's over?

It says in Romans 4.25, Jesus was put to death for our sins, but he was raised for our justification. What's that mean? It means this. When you see death, when you get near death,  when you go to a funeral with somebody you know, no matter who they are. In spite of the fact that this society will tell you death is natural,  it's a normal part of living, you know it's not.

Death is unnatural, death isn't right. We don't want to die, we don't want to say our loved ones die. There's something abnormal about it. Death forbids us to rise, but we want to rise, but it forbids us to rise. Death pulls us down.

Death isn't right. That's the reason why that famous line of Dylan Thomas is so famous. Dylan Thomas says, we rage against the dying of the light. We rage, we know death isn't natural, but if it's not natural, then it's been inflicted. So you know that death is a natural, but if death is a natural, then it's a judgment, then it's a punishment.

And why? Well, the Bible answers that. We have been put into a world that's built. It's built to work if we live not for ourselves, but for others and for God. We're built to serve other people and to preserve God.

That's not how we live. We live to serve ourselves and use other people in God to reach our needs and to get to our goals. And as a result, the world doesn't work. And we don't work in death is a natural consequence. We're going against the warp and woof and fabric of a reality and the wages of that is disintegration.

And disintegration is death. And therefore, death has authority. Death is a judgment. When Jesus Christ died, Paul says, if he didn't rise, you're still in your sins. Why?

Here's why. If Jesus Christ had died, death would still be owed. Death would still have authority. But when Jesus Christ rose, we already sang about it. Death in vain forbids him rise.

The last hymn, too, is great. It talks about death in vain. Death can't. Why? Because justice has been paid.

Judgment has been paid. Jesus Christ, when he died, rendered everything necessary. And therefore, death in vain. Death has no power. Death has no authority over us.

And therefore, condemnation is done. See? The resurrection means condemnation is over. The resurrection means that your sins have been paid for. God has satisfied you.

Actually, if you go to the Old Testament on one day of the year,  all the people gathered, and the high priest came on Yom Kippur,  and what do the high priest do? He went into the veil. What was behind the veil? The Holy of Holies. Where was he going?

He was going to a tone for the sins of the people. And everybody was nervous. Why? Because he was going back before the raw presence of God. Would the sacrifice be acceptable?

Somebody waited with Bated Breath, and he went down. He almost went to a certain death. He went into the veil. But after he had made the sacrifice every year, he came out. He came through.

And everybody rejoiced why? Because it meant that there's sins have been a tone for. But that was happening every year, over and over again, as the book of Hebrews says,  in a way that can ever completely satisfy the conscience. But when Jesus Christ went into the earth and came out,  that was God's way of saying to everybody,  your sins have been paid in full. And that's the reason why, on the one hand, without the resurrection,  you have absolutely no confidence that God looks at you right now and is satisfied and accepts you.

But on the other hand, the resurrection does not just prove that something is over. It proves that something has begun. It goes in verse 20 to 23. Twice. We're told Jesus Christ is the first fruits.

Now what's the first fruits? Wow. Here's what the first fruits mean. There is a world. There is an eternal world.

A world of complete justice. A world of complete love. A world where nothing gets old and dies into case. World of life and truth and beauty. But it's the ideal world.

And this is the real world. And everybody knows that there's a concrete slab between the real world and the ideal world. But when Jesus rose from the dead, this was not just fireworks. This was not just a naked display of power. This was the ideal breaking into the real Jesus Christ is the first fruits.

What are the first fruits? It's the first thing out of the garden. It's the first thing out of the grain. It's the first fruit of the vine. It's what's about to come.

It's the reality. It's really part of the harvest, even though it's not in there in fullness. And what it means is the future of God has landed. In the resurrection, a hole was punched in the pitiless walls of the world. And into a world of decay has come immortality.

Into a world of darkness has come light. And when Jesus Christ says, believe in me and you'll receive the resurrection into your life. This is not just, you're going to get inspired. You're going to get a little happy. You know, he's going to kind of give you strength to go through the day.

Lift up your eyes. Give up your small ambitions. The Bible says that Christians and the church is God's eschatological beechhead. That means the future eschatology, eschatological means his future has come in now. Partial but real.

First fruits, but only first. But really fruits, but only the first. But into the world now, when you become a Christian into your heart comes the fruit of the spirit. And your life comes the gifts of the spirit. And your heart comes real, divine, future joy and love and glory.

And when you have the gifts of the spirit, it means that when you care for other people,  when you counsel other people, when you witness other people, when you teach other people,  you're bringing the life of the future into their lives. And the alienations of this world. The alienation where we're spiritually alienated from God,  and we're psychologically alienated from our true selves,  we're socially alienated from other races and classes and nationalities. Those things begin to get healed through the gifts of the spirit which are given to you because the future has come. Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer?

Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith? For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding of what it means to follow Christ. A great resource to start using this summer is the new city catechism devotional. God's truth for our hearts and minds. This devotional brings the historic catechisms of the Christian Church to life,  offering a question to consider for each week of the year.

In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catechesis,  the rich and communal practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers that frame the foundational beliefs of the Christian faith. Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer, and a brief meditation that will challenge and inspire you. The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller, and Kevin De Young,  as well as historical figures such as Augustine, John Calvin, and Martin Luther. This month, in addition to the new city catechism devotional,  we are including a great companion resource, the new city catechism for kids,  as our thank you for your gift to help gospel and life share the hope of Christ's love with people all over the world. So, request your copies today at gospelonlife.com slash give.

That's gospelonlife.com slash give. Now, here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. The resurrection has brought the future into the present. The resurrection has brought you your justification. So, what's over the condemnation and judgment forever?

And what's begun? The kingdom. That's right there in verses 20 to 24. The first fruits of what? The kingdom.

First, then, and finally, the full kingdom. That's what 20 to 24 says. Now, let's get to the last point because Paul is basically saying all of this to get to the end. When you get to the end, he's saying, all right, what difference does this make in the way we live? And I love the word there in verse 58 or 59 where he says,  therefore, my dear brothers, stand firm.

Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord. Therefore, what's there for? What's there for referring to? Let me take a minute here.

How do you deal with trouble? How do you become strong? How do you face the troubles of life? How do you become immovable? How do you become someone who stands firm?

That's what Paul's talking about. How do you do it? How do you deal with the troubles of life? You know, you just stiffen your upper lip. You say, I'm going to be tough.

You just say, I'm a Christian. I'm not going to let this get to me. That's not what Paul does. Paul doesn't say, you know, stiffen your upper lip and let nothing move you. What is it, therefore, referring to?

Therefore is all the theology of 1 Corinthians 15. See, when Paul says, I want you to become somebody who's strong. He doesn't say just to fight the world. He says, think. He says, think to the glory of what God has done overwhelms you.

It's very holistic. Get your mind engaged until your heart gets so-or-flowing that your will becomes absolutely overwhelmingly strong. So when Paul said a little word, therefore, is referring back to all the 1 Corinthians  and what he's really doing, the way most of us deal with trouble is we just defy. It's just totally stoic. We work right with the will, not Paul.

Paul says, you need hope. And hope only comes from an understanding that this resurrection really happened and what it did. You know, one of my heroes is Sam, Gamgee and Lord of the Rings. And there's one place where he's just about at the end of his rope. And he looks up into the stars and he sees something.

It says, he crawled from the hiding place and he looked out. The land seemed full of creaking and cracking and sly noises. He was in a terrible spot. It was, you don't need to know. But he says, they're peeping up among the cloud rack far above a dark tower in the mountains.

Sam saw a white star twinkle. The beauty of it smote his heart. As he looked up out of the forsaken land and hope returned to him,  for like a shaft clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the end the shadow was only a small and passing thing. There was light and high beauty forever beyond its reach. His song and the tower had been defiance rather than hope for then he was thinking of himself.

Now for a moment, his own fate ceased to trouble him. He crawled back into the brambles, laid himself down and putting away all fear. He cast himself into a deep untroubled sleep. Now there's a lot of nuances in there. See, in the past, the way Sam had gotten strong was he was just defying.

He worked directly on his will. But in the end, you notice it said, it said it was self-absorbed. To be self-absorbed to say, I'm not going to sweat, I'm not going to sweat, I'm going to be okay, I'm going to be strong. But suddenly here, he got hope. What is hope?

A thought that pierced his heart. See, like a shaft clear and cold, the thought pierced his heart. That in the end the shadow was a small and passing thing and there was light and high beauty forever beyond its reach. Now that is nothing but whistling in the dark unless the resurrection of Jesus Christ happened. And if it happened, then I suggest you look at it, like Sam looked at that star until the shaft pierces your heart and then you will be immovable.

Nothing will bother you. Let me just give you quickly some things that won't bother you that are mentioned here. First of all, your sins and flaws won't bother you. Do you believe in the resurrection? You see?

If Jesus is out, then God looks at you and is satisfied and accepts you and your sins and flaws won't bother you. You say, how does that work? Imagine you're buying something in Macy's. Macy's a very, very big store and let's just say you bought something huge, some big object that you can't put in a bag. And you have to walk from where you are out to the street.

Now when you get to the street, you'll be all right. But on the way out, you know what they'll say? They'll take a receipt. Why? Well, if a security man stops you or if a salesperson or somebody stops you and says, what are you doing with that?

What you can do is you can wave your receipt and you can say, trouble me not. I have paid for this. I don't owe a penny. I owe nothing. I'm free and clear.

What is the resurrection? It's your receipt. Because you see, you're going to get questions. You're going to get lots of questions. You're going to get questions from the world.

You're going to get questions from the flesh and you're going to get questions from the devil. And the questions will come like this. It'll say, if anybody knew the kind of thoughts that go through your heart during the west side five o'clock service. I notice somebody who's pretty attractive over there and I start to think about things and, wow, I can't believe it. Here I am in church.

Oh my gosh. Your own heart's going to come and say, what makes you think God loves you? Why would God love you? And as your heart starts to sink, you pull out your receipt, which is the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Trouble me not.

Trouble me not. I'm paid for. I'm free and clear. You see, don't you dare flagulate. You can say this is the world of flesh, your own heart, the devil, whatever.

Don't you dare flagulate me and I'm not going to flagulate myself because he is risen and that's my receipt. That means everything's been paid in full. So don't let your sins and your flaws get you down. Don't let them move you. Don't let them throw you.

See, let nothing move you. Don't let them move you. Secondly, don't let ambiguity of life move you. Now I know this is going to sound weird, I'll be brief. Christians, if you understand the doctrine of the resurrection and the doctrine of the resurrection is the first fruits, but only the first fruits.

In other words, the future of God has landed, which means incredible powers available to see all sorts of things change, but it's only the beginning. It's only the first fruits. God hasn't come in his fullness. There's still tons and tons of brokenness. There's still tons and tons of death.

There's all kinds of problems. Now what does that mean? Well, people get into the life and first of all, see all kinds of disappointments and all kinds of tragedies and they'll harden their hearts. They'll say, look at how bad life is. So you give up hope, you get cynical, you say, well, what can you expect?

You harden yourself because you don't want to be disappointed. But Christians won't do that. Christians stay impatient with the world. They stay impatient with themselves because they have hope. If you have hope, you're impatient.

If you say to other your friends, you could be better than this. If you say to yourself, you could be better than this. If you say to New York City, you could be so much better than this. You're not a cynic. You're impatient because you're filled with hope.

But Christians also are against padd answers. Christians also realize there's all sorts of brokenness here. Christians should not be naive, bright eyed, bushy, tailed people and they shouldn't be cynical. People, they shouldn't be walk around saying everything's a blessing and there's going to be revival. If you just believe in Jesus Christ, your whole life will come together.

That's not what that's not the doctrine of the resurrection. We only have the first fruits. That's it. There's all sorts of brokenness here. Christians have the theology to understand the ambiguity of life in a way that nobody else does and therefore we should have high tolerance for ambiguity, not ambiguity of belief, but the ambiguity of the circumstances of life.

Neither cynical nor naive, you see. Happily ironic. You see, joyfully humble, bold and absolutely ready to have God say, no. Are you ready for that? You know, an awful lot of people go from the cynicism, from the naivete to the cynicism and it happens in Christianity.

People who are Christians are very, very naive and everything's going to be fine. And then we find that things aren't fine and then they get really, really cynical because you aren't listening to the sermon. Thirdly, and lastly, don't let your sins throw you. Don't let the ambiguities of life throw you, but lastly, don't let death throw you. It's a historic fact that when the epidemics swept through the Roman cities, in the first, second and third centuries BC, the AD, the Roman cities, the plagues came through and the pagans though they didn't believe in, they didn't have germ theory, they knew that if you kept contact with someone who was sick, you were going to die too.

And the plagues were probably smallpox and they were terrible. 25 to 33% of all the people in the major Roman cities died during the epidemics. And we're told that what pagans did was those who had the means got out of the city and it was very, very normal when a member of your own family got sick to even before he or she was dead throw them in the street. But Christians did not leave. Christians picked up not only their own sick and stayed in the city and cared for them, they picked up the pagan sick, touching them, lifting them up, their sores oozing onto their hands, knowing that this probably meant they might die, but they stayed. Now why did, and historians will show you that the Christianity Christians, because they stayed, because they weren't afraid, because they cared for the sick and the dying and the poor, not only their own, but also of pagans, it had an enormous impact on the people.

It had an enormous impact on society, it made Christians incredibly credible, but here's the question, why did they stay? And the pagans left. Well, you say, well, I guess Christians were better people. No, they believed in the resurrection. It had pierced their heart like a shaft.

And they looked around, they said, everything was, there was oppression, and there was, there was disease, and there was death, and they said, what? The shadow was a passing thing. Compared to light and high beauty, and because the resurrection happened, we know it's there, therefore, what if I die? Come on, death, give me your best shot. Do your worst.

The lower you lay me, the higher you'll raise me, the worse that you can do is the best is just make me better. As George Herbert said, death used to be an executioner, but the gospel made him just a gardener. And the other reason that they picked up the bodies was because the resurrection doesn't just make you unafraid of death and willing to handle suffering. But the resurrection also means the body matters. The body matters.

Jesus Christ came from heaven to earth, not to deliver us from the body, but to mend the body. Jesus Christ took a body, and he raised the body, he didn't discard the body. In other words, in other words, not just the soul, but the body is the object of God's redemptive purposes. And if Jesus Christ would go to all this suffering and come all the way to not just redeem your soul, but your body, then Christians see people who are hungry, people who are poor, people who are disease. This is the reason why we take the Easter sacrificial offering for the needs of the poor and the needs of the city, because the resurrection means God does not just want your soul save, but he wants your body mended.

And Christians are out there not just to save people's souls, but to bring healing to every aspect of life, to deal with every aspect of sin. Listen, let nothing move you. Therefore, do you understand this? To the degree you do, nothing will move you. Let's pray.

Father, we ask that you would make us these strong, immutable people, because of the hope that has pierced our heart like a shaft. Not just defiance, not just keeping us to the upper lip, not just stoicism, but truth hitting our heart and overwhelming us with the glory of it, till we become people like those folks who change the old Roman world we could do it now. Make us people of the resurrection in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

The musicians have heard this three times. And they are so holy that tonight, when they turn off the lights, they're going to glow in the dark. But you don't know what those three things are yet. And so, just to get a little bit of the effulgence of the musicians to get your cut, let's read. First Corinthians 15.

For what I received, I passed on to you as of first importance,  that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,  that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,  and that He appeared to Peter, and then to the twelve. And after that, He appeared to more than 500 of the brothers at the same time,  most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead. And the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep, for since death, came through a man. The resurrection of the dead comes also through a man.

For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. But each in his own turn, Christ the first fruits, then when He comes those who belong to Him,  then the end will come when He hands over the kingdom to God the Father  after He has destroyed all dominion, authority and power, for He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death. Listen, I tell you a mystery. We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed in a flash.

In the twinkle of an eye, at the last trumpet, for the trumpet will sound. The dead will be raised in perishable, and we will be changed. For the perishable must close itself with imperishable, and the mortal with immortality. And when the perishable has been clothed within the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality,  then the saying that is written will come true. Death is swallowed up in victory.

Where O death is your victory, where O death is your sting. The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law, but thanks be to God. He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore my dear brothers stand firm, but nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.

Now, what Paul does here is he answers three questions, and it's a long chapter,  and I've only pulled a couple of pieces out, and you could do worse than to read the whole chapter on Easter Sunday. First Corinthians 15, maybe the great chapter in the whole Bible on the meaning of the resurrection of Jesus. And he answers three questions about Jesus' resurrection. Did he do it? What did it do?

And what should we do about it? See, did it happen, in other words, what did it accomplish, and what should we do about it? Now, those three things hang together, though I'd like to concentrate tonight on the last point. But see, here's how they hang together. First of all, Paul, in the first few verses, tries to explain that if you're going to get the benefits of the resurrection in your life,  if it's really going to make a difference in your life, if it's really going to change you, you have to believe it actually happened.

That's the reason he goes to the trouble in the very beginning of saying,  look, I received. Now, these are technical Greek verbs, actually. He chooses verbs when he says, I received, and I passed on to you. These are verbs that mean I researched, I got information, and I passed it on. I talked to the eyewitnesses.

I talked to 500. He says, 500 Christians who are still alive when I'm writing this, which is 20 years after Jesus' death and resurrection,  who are still there, you can still go and ask them. See, when Paul makes this sort of public claim in a publicly circulated letter, when he says, look, there are 500 witnesses, go and talk to them if you want. They all saw Jesus at once after he had been raised from the dead. What is Paul doing?

He was saying, it matters. It matters whether you believe it really happened. The average person in New York City believes the resurrection is a wonderful concept. It's a symbol. It's a symbol of good triumphing over bad.

It's a symbol that you can have a new start after a disaster. If you want a little example of it, of that view of the resurrection, it's the New York Times lead editorial today. It says, well, Christians have always celebrated the fact that here was a man who stood against tyranny. Since Christians are not supposed to be sensitive, that would be an insult and therefore it's not. But if we were sensitive, it would be an insult.

Paul goes to great pains and says, if you have a comfortable little life, the symbol of the resurrection,  meaning just how good things overcome bad things eventually, might be a some comfort. In your life with concrete trouble, concrete trials, concrete, real death coming at you,  unless you believe in a concrete, real physical, literal, historical resurrection, you're not going to be any different. You're not going to be able to handle real trouble unless you believe in a real resurrection. You can't believe the resurrection is just a beautiful symbol but didn't happen literally or physically. Paul goes out of his way to say, like in verse 20, but Christ has risen indeed.

That's why we say, not just he's risen, indeed he's risen, really risen, actually risen. His body rekindled and he walked out. And Paul's here saying, the reason he lays all these verses down in the very beginning is,  he says unless you believe it, it's not going to change you. That's the first point. Now, the second point is not only does he say, you have to believe it happen,  but he also says, you have to believe or have to understand what it accomplished.

The resurrection isn't just something that happened. It's not just a naked display of power, it accomplishes something. And what is it accomplish? Well, there's two things that Paul says happen, the resurrection accomplishes. The first one, he says in verse 17, which I didn't print there unfortunately,  where Paul says, if Christ has not raised from the dead, you're still in your sins.

In fact, he says it in a very vivid way. He says, if Christ is still in the ground, you are still in your sins. Why would that be? Because the resurrection proves that something is over. What's over?

It says in Romans 4.25, Jesus was put to death for our sins, but he was raised for our justification. What's that mean? It means this. When you see death, when you get near death,  when you go to a funeral with somebody you know, no matter who they are. In spite of the fact that this society will tell you death is natural,  it's a normal part of living, you know it's not.

Death is unnatural, death isn't right. We don't want to die, we don't want to say our loved ones die. There's something abnormal about it. Death forbids us to rise, but we want to rise, but it forbids us to rise. Death pulls us down.

Death isn't right. That's the reason why that famous line of Dylan Thomas is so famous. Dylan Thomas says, we rage against the dying of the light. We rage, we know death isn't natural, but if it's not natural, then it's been inflicted. So you know that death is a natural, but if death is a natural, then it's a judgment, then it's a punishment.

And why? Well, the Bible answers that. We have been put into a world that's built. It's built to work if we live not for ourselves, but for others and for God. We're built to serve other people and to preserve God.

That's not how we live. We live to serve ourselves and use other people in God to reach our needs and to get to our goals. And as a result, the world doesn't work. And we don't work in death is a natural consequence. We're going against the warp and woof and fabric of a reality and the wages of that is disintegration.

And disintegration is death. And therefore, death has authority. Death is a judgment. When Jesus Christ died, Paul says, if he didn't rise, you're still in your sins. Why?

Here's why. If Jesus Christ had died, death would still be owed. Death would still have authority. But when Jesus Christ rose, we already sang about it. Death in vain forbids him rise.

The last hymn, too, is great. It talks about death in vain. Death can't. Why? Because justice has been paid.

Judgment has been paid. Jesus Christ, when he died, rendered everything necessary. And therefore, death in vain. Death has no power. Death has no authority over us.

And therefore, condemnation is done. See? The resurrection means condemnation is over. The resurrection means that your sins have been paid for. God has satisfied you.

Actually, if you go to the Old Testament on one day of the year,  all the people gathered, and the high priest came on Yom Kippur,  and what do the high priest do? He went into the veil. What was behind the veil? The Holy of Holies. Where was he going?

He was going to a tone for the sins of the people. And everybody was nervous. Why? Because he was going back before the raw presence of God. Would the sacrifice be acceptable?

Somebody waited with Bated Breath, and he went down. He almost went to a certain death. He went into the veil. But after he had made the sacrifice every year, he came out. He came through.

And everybody rejoiced why? Because it meant that there's sins have been a tone for. But that was happening every year, over and over again, as the book of Hebrews says,  in a way that can ever completely satisfy the conscience. But when Jesus Christ went into the earth and came out,  that was God's way of saying to everybody,  your sins have been paid in full. And that's the reason why, on the one hand, without the resurrection,  you have absolutely no confidence that God looks at you right now and is satisfied and accepts you.

But on the other hand, the resurrection does not just prove that something is over. It proves that something has begun. It goes in verse 20 to 23. Twice. We're told Jesus Christ is the first fruits.

Now what's the first fruits? Wow. Here's what the first fruits mean. There is a world. There is an eternal world.

A world of complete justice. A world of complete love. A world where nothing gets old and dies into case. World of life and truth and beauty. But it's the ideal world.

And this is the real world. And everybody knows that there's a concrete slab between the real world and the ideal world. But when Jesus rose from the dead, this was not just fireworks. This was not just a naked display of power. This was the ideal breaking into the real Jesus Christ is the first fruits.

What are the first fruits? It's the first thing out of the garden. It's the first thing out of the grain. It's the first fruit of the vine. It's what's about to come.

It's the reality. It's really part of the harvest, even though it's not in there in fullness. And what it means is the future of God has landed. In the resurrection, a hole was punched in the pitiless walls of the world. And into a world of decay has come immortality.

Into a world of darkness has come light. And when Jesus Christ says, believe in me and you'll receive the resurrection into your life. This is not just, you're going to get inspired. You're going to get a little happy. You know, he's going to kind of give you strength to go through the day.

Lift up your eyes. Give up your small ambitions. The Bible says that Christians and the church is God's eschatological beechhead. That means the future eschatology, eschatological means his future has come in now. Partial but real.

First fruits, but only first. But really fruits, but only the first. But into the world now, when you become a Christian into your heart comes the fruit of the spirit. And your life comes the gifts of the spirit. And your heart comes real, divine, future joy and love and glory.

And when you have the gifts of the spirit, it means that when you care for other people,  when you counsel other people, when you witness other people, when you teach other people,  you're bringing the life of the future into their lives. And the alienations of this world. The alienation where we're spiritually alienated from God,  and we're psychologically alienated from our true selves,  we're socially alienated from other races and classes and nationalities. Those things begin to get healed through the gifts of the spirit which are given to you because the future has come. Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer?

Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith? For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding of what it means to follow Christ. A great resource to start using this summer is the new city catechism devotional. God's truth for our hearts and minds. This devotional brings the historic catechisms of the Christian Church to life,  offering a question to consider for each week of the year.

In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catechesis,  the rich and communal practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers that frame the foundational beliefs of the Christian faith. Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer, and a brief meditation that will challenge and inspire you. The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller, and Kevin De Young,  as well as historical figures such as Augustine, John Calvin, and Martin Luther. This month, in addition to the new city catechism devotional,  we are including a great companion resource, the new city catechism for kids,  as our thank you for your gift to help gospel and life share the hope of Christ's love with people all over the world. So, request your copies today at gospelonlife.com slash give.

That's gospelonlife.com slash give. Now, here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. The resurrection has brought the future into the present. The resurrection has brought you your justification. So, what's over the condemnation and judgment forever?

And what's begun? The kingdom. That's right there in verses 20 to 24. The first fruits of what? The kingdom.

First, then, and finally, the full kingdom. That's what 20 to 24 says. Now, let's get to the last point because Paul is basically saying all of this to get to the end. When you get to the end, he's saying, all right, what difference does this make in the way we live? And I love the word there in verse 58 or 59 where he says,  therefore, my dear brothers, stand firm.

Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord. Therefore, what's there for? What's there for referring to? Let me take a minute here.

How do you deal with trouble? How do you become strong? How do you face the troubles of life? How do you become immovable? How do you become someone who stands firm?

That's what Paul's talking about. How do you do it? How do you deal with the troubles of life? You know, you just stiffen your upper lip. You say, I'm going to be tough.

You just say, I'm a Christian. I'm not going to let this get to me. That's not what Paul does. Paul doesn't say, you know, stiffen your upper lip and let nothing move you. What is it, therefore, referring to?

Therefore is all the theology of 1 Corinthians 15. See, when Paul says, I want you to become somebody who's strong. He doesn't say just to fight the world. He says, think. He says, think to the glory of what God has done overwhelms you.

It's very holistic. Get your mind engaged until your heart gets so-or-flowing that your will becomes absolutely overwhelmingly strong. So when Paul said a little word, therefore, is referring back to all the 1 Corinthians  and what he's really doing, the way most of us deal with trouble is we just defy. It's just totally stoic. We work right with the will, not Paul.

Paul says, you need hope. And hope only comes from an understanding that this resurrection really happened and what it did. You know, one of my heroes is Sam, Gamgee and Lord of the Rings. And there's one place where he's just about at the end of his rope. And he looks up into the stars and he sees something.

It says, he crawled from the hiding place and he looked out. The land seemed full of creaking and cracking and sly noises. He was in a terrible spot. It was, you don't need to know. But he says, they're peeping up among the cloud rack far above a dark tower in the mountains.

Sam saw a white star twinkle. The beauty of it smote his heart. As he looked up out of the forsaken land and hope returned to him,  for like a shaft clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the end the shadow was only a small and passing thing. There was light and high beauty forever beyond its reach. His song and the tower had been defiance rather than hope for then he was thinking of himself.

Now for a moment, his own fate ceased to trouble him. He crawled back into the brambles, laid himself down and putting away all fear. He cast himself into a deep untroubled sleep. Now there's a lot of nuances in there. See, in the past, the way Sam had gotten strong was he was just defying.

He worked directly on his will. But in the end, you notice it said, it said it was self-absorbed. To be self-absorbed to say, I'm not going to sweat, I'm not going to sweat, I'm going to be okay, I'm going to be strong. But suddenly here, he got hope. What is hope?

A thought that pierced his heart. See, like a shaft clear and cold, the thought pierced his heart. That in the end the shadow was a small and passing thing and there was light and high beauty forever beyond its reach. Now that is nothing but whistling in the dark unless the resurrection of Jesus Christ happened. And if it happened, then I suggest you look at it, like Sam looked at that star until the shaft pierces your heart and then you will be immovable.

Nothing will bother you. Let me just give you quickly some things that won't bother you that are mentioned here. First of all, your sins and flaws won't bother you. Do you believe in the resurrection? You see?

If Jesus is out, then God looks at you and is satisfied and accepts you and your sins and flaws won't bother you. You say, how does that work? Imagine you're buying something in Macy's. Macy's a very, very big store and let's just say you bought something huge, some big object that you can't put in a bag. And you have to walk from where you are out to the street.

Now when you get to the street, you'll be all right. But on the way out, you know what they'll say? They'll take a receipt. Why? Well, if a security man stops you or if a salesperson or somebody stops you and says, what are you doing with that?

What you can do is you can wave your receipt and you can say, trouble me not. I have paid for this. I don't owe a penny. I owe nothing. I'm free and clear.

What is the resurrection? It's your receipt. Because you see, you're going to get questions. You're going to get lots of questions. You're going to get questions from the world.

You're going to get questions from the flesh and you're going to get questions from the devil. And the questions will come like this. It'll say, if anybody knew the kind of thoughts that go through your heart during the west side five o'clock service. I notice somebody who's pretty attractive over there and I start to think about things and, wow, I can't believe it. Here I am in church.

Oh my gosh. Your own heart's going to come and say, what makes you think God loves you? Why would God love you? And as your heart starts to sink, you pull out your receipt, which is the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Trouble me not.

Trouble me not. I'm paid for. I'm free and clear. You see, don't you dare flagulate. You can say this is the world of flesh, your own heart, the devil, whatever.

Don't you dare flagulate me and I'm not going to flagulate myself because he is risen and that's my receipt. That means everything's been paid in full. So don't let your sins and your flaws get you down. Don't let them move you. Don't let them throw you.

See, let nothing move you. Don't let them move you. Secondly, don't let ambiguity of life move you. Now I know this is going to sound weird, I'll be brief. Christians, if you understand the doctrine of the resurrection and the doctrine of the resurrection is the first fruits, but only the first fruits.

In other words, the future of God has landed, which means incredible powers available to see all sorts of things change, but it's only the beginning. It's only the first fruits. God hasn't come in his fullness. There's still tons and tons of brokenness. There's still tons and tons of death.

There's all kinds of problems. Now what does that mean? Well, people get into the life and first of all, see all kinds of disappointments and all kinds of tragedies and they'll harden their hearts. They'll say, look at how bad life is. So you give up hope, you get cynical, you say, well, what can you expect?

You harden yourself because you don't want to be disappointed. But Christians won't do that. Christians stay impatient with the world. They stay impatient with themselves because they have hope. If you have hope, you're impatient.

If you say to other your friends, you could be better than this. If you say to yourself, you could be better than this. If you say to New York City, you could be so much better than this. You're not a cynic. You're impatient because you're filled with hope.

But Christians also are against padd answers. Christians also realize there's all sorts of brokenness here. Christians should not be naive, bright eyed, bushy, tailed people and they shouldn't be cynical. People, they shouldn't be walk around saying everything's a blessing and there's going to be revival. If you just believe in Jesus Christ, your whole life will come together.

That's not what that's not the doctrine of the resurrection. We only have the first fruits. That's it. There's all sorts of brokenness here. Christians have the theology to understand the ambiguity of life in a way that nobody else does and therefore we should have high tolerance for ambiguity, not ambiguity of belief, but the ambiguity of the circumstances of life.

Neither cynical nor naive, you see. Happily ironic. You see, joyfully humble, bold and absolutely ready to have God say, no. Are you ready for that? You know, an awful lot of people go from the cynicism, from the naivete to the cynicism and it happens in Christianity.

People who are Christians are very, very naive and everything's going to be fine. And then we find that things aren't fine and then they get really, really cynical because you aren't listening to the sermon. Thirdly, and lastly, don't let your sins throw you. Don't let the ambiguities of life throw you, but lastly, don't let death throw you. It's a historic fact that when the epidemics swept through the Roman cities, in the first, second and third centuries BC, the AD, the Roman cities, the plagues came through and the pagans though they didn't believe in, they didn't have germ theory, they knew that if you kept contact with someone who was sick, you were going to die too.

And the plagues were probably smallpox and they were terrible. 25 to 33% of all the people in the major Roman cities died during the epidemics. And we're told that what pagans did was those who had the means got out of the city and it was very, very normal when a member of your own family got sick to even before he or she was dead throw them in the street. But Christians did not leave. Christians picked up not only their own sick and stayed in the city and cared for them, they picked up the pagan sick, touching them, lifting them up, their sores oozing onto their hands, knowing that this probably meant they might die, but they stayed. Now why did, and historians will show you that the Christianity Christians, because they stayed, because they weren't afraid, because they cared for the sick and the dying and the poor, not only their own, but also of pagans, it had an enormous impact on the people.

It had an enormous impact on society, it made Christians incredibly credible, but here's the question, why did they stay? And the pagans left. Well, you say, well, I guess Christians were better people. No, they believed in the resurrection. It had pierced their heart like a shaft.

And they looked around, they said, everything was, there was oppression, and there was, there was disease, and there was death, and they said, what? The shadow was a passing thing. Compared to light and high beauty, and because the resurrection happened, we know it's there, therefore, what if I die? Come on, death, give me your best shot. Do your worst.

The lower you lay me, the higher you'll raise me, the worse that you can do is the best is just make me better. As George Herbert said, death used to be an executioner, but the gospel made him just a gardener. And the other reason that they picked up the bodies was because the resurrection doesn't just make you unafraid of death and willing to handle suffering. But the resurrection also means the body matters. The body matters.

Jesus Christ came from heaven to earth, not to deliver us from the body, but to mend the body. Jesus Christ took a body, and he raised the body, he didn't discard the body. In other words, in other words, not just the soul, but the body is the object of God's redemptive purposes. And if Jesus Christ would go to all this suffering and come all the way to not just redeem your soul, but your body, then Christians see people who are hungry, people who are poor, people who are disease. This is the reason why we take the Easter sacrificial offering for the needs of the poor and the needs of the city, because the resurrection means God does not just want your soul save, but he wants your body mended.

And Christians are out there not just to save people's souls, but to bring healing to every aspect of life, to deal with every aspect of sin. Listen, let nothing move you. Therefore, do you understand this? To the degree you do, nothing will move you. Let's pray.

Father, we ask that you would make us these strong, immutable people, because of the hope that has pierced our heart like a shaft. Not just defiance, not just keeping us to the upper lip, not just stoicism, but truth hitting our heart and overwhelming us with the glory of it, till we become people like those folks who change the old Roman world we could do it now. Make us people of the resurrection in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

欢迎收听《福音与生活》（Gospel and Life）播客。你认为基督的复活只是一个象征，还是一个真实发生在历史中的事件？今天，Tim Keller 要讲的是：只有当你相信复活在历史中真实发生，它才能真正改变你。

听完今天的信息，我们邀请你上网访问 gospelandlife.com 注册电子邮件订阅。当你订阅后，你会定期收到我们的季刊，还有其他许多以福音为中心的宝贵资源。

你今天就可以前往 gospelandlife.com 订阅。现在，请翻开讲道所根据的经文——《哥林多前书》第 15 章。保罗在这里关于复活讲了三件根本的事情。现在，乐手们已经知道这三件事了，不是吗？

乐手们已经听了三遍这篇讲道。他们是如此圣洁，以至于今晚关灯的时候，他们都会在黑暗中发光。但你们还不知道这三件事是什么。所以，为了让你们也分一点乐手身上的荣光，我们一起来读这段经文——《哥林多前书》第 15 章。

“我当日所领受又传给你们的，第一，就是基督照圣经所说，为我们的罪死了；而且埋葬了，又照圣经所说，第三天复活了，并且显给矶法看，然后显给十二使徒看。后来一时显给五百多弟兄看，其中多数到如今还在，却也有已经睡了的。”

“但基督已经从死里复活，成为睡了之人初熟的果子。死既是因一人而来，死人复活也是因一人而来。在亚当里众人都死了；照样，在基督里众人也都要复活。但各人是按着自己的次序：初熟的果子是基督，以后在他来的时候，是那些属基督的。再后，末期到了，那时他要把国交与父神，既将一切执政的、掌权的、有能的都毁灭了。因为基督必要作王，等神把一切仇敌都放在他的脚下。尽末了所毁灭的仇敌，就是死。”

“看哪，我把一件奥秘的事告诉你们：我们不是都要睡觉，乃是都要改变，就在一霎时，眨眼之间，号筒末次吹响的时候。因号筒要响，死人要复活，成为不朽坏的，我们也要改变。这必朽坏的总要变成不朽坏的，这必死的总要变成不死的。既变成不朽坏、不死的，那经上所记‘死被得胜吞灭’的话就应验了。‘死啊，你得胜的权势在哪里？死啊，你的毒钩在哪里？’”

“死的毒钩就是罪，罪的权势就是律法。感谢神，使我们藉着我们的主耶稣基督得胜。所以，我亲爱的弟兄们，你们务要坚固，不可摇动，常常竭力多做主工，因为知道你们的劳苦在主里面不是徒然的。”

保罗在这里做的，是回答三个问题。这一章很长，我只节选了其中几段。这个复活节主日，你完全可以把整章都读一遍——《哥林多前书》15 章，也许是整本圣经中最重要、最精彩的一章，专门讲耶稣复活的意义。

他回答的是关于耶稣复活的三个问题：他真的复活了吗？复活成就了什么？我们又该怎样回应？换句话说：它是否发生？它带来什么功效？我们要如何因着复活而活？

这三点是连在一起的，尽管今晚我会特别着重第三点。但你要看到，它们是怎样彼此连结的。首先，保罗在开头几节经文里说，如果你要在生命中真正得着复活的益处，如果复活真的要在你里面产生改变、带来实际的力量，你就必须相信它确实发生过。

这就是为什么他在一开始要费这么大的劲，说：“我所领受的，又传给你们的……”这里用到的是一些很“技术性”的希腊文动词。他说“领受”、“传给你们”，用的是“我仔细打听、查考、得到见证，再转交给你们”的意思。我去找过目击者，我去见过那五百个人。他说，那五百多位基督徒在我写这封信的时候大多数还活着——也就是在耶稣死而复活后二十年左右——他们还在那里，你们随时可以去问他们。

他在一封公开流传的书信里，作出这样的公开声明：“有五百多位见证人，如果你愿意，你可以去问他们。他们都曾在同一时间，看见耶稣在从死里复活之后向他们显现。”你看，保罗在做什么？

他是在说：这件事很重要，你是否相信它真的发生，这件事极其重要。

纽约的大多数人会觉得“复活”是一个很美好的概念，是一个象征。它象征着“好终将战胜坏”，象征你在经历灾难之后，还可以重新开始一种新的生活。如果你想要一个这种看法的例子，可以去看今天《纽约时报》的社论。大致就是这种说法：基督徒一直庆祝的，是有这么一个人，挺身而出反抗暴政。

如果基督徒是那种很玻璃心的人，这会是一种侮辱；但既然我们不该玻璃心，那也就算不上侮辱。保罗却非常认真地说：如果你只是过着一个小康舒适、没什么波澜的生活，那么把“复活”当作一个象征——象征某种“好终究战胜坏”的力量——也许能给你一点点安慰。但如果你面对的是具体的麻烦、具体的试炼、具体的死亡现实正向你逼近，那么除非你相信有一个具体的、真实的、肉身的、历史上的复活，否则你这个人不会真正不一样，你就不会有能力面对真正的苦难。

你不能只把复活当作一个美丽的象征，却不相信它在历史中真实地、物理地发生过。保罗特别强调这一点，比如在第 20 节说：“但如今基督已经从死里复活。”所以我们才会说，不只是“他复活了”，而是“他确实复活了，真实地复活了”。他的身体重新活了过来，他从坟墓里走了出来。

保罗在这里说，他之所以在开头用这么多经节，是因为：除非你相信这件事真实发生，否则它在你生命中不会产生改变。这是第一点。

第二点，他不仅说你必须相信复活发生过，他还说：你必须明白复活成就了什么。复活不只是“发生了一件事”，它不只是上帝力量的一个“裸露展示”，它成就、完成了一些事情。

那复活成就了什么呢？保罗至少提到两点。第一点在第 17 节（很可惜我没有把这一节印在讲章提纲上），保罗说：“若基督没有复活，你们的信便是徒然，你们仍在罪里。”其实他用非常生动的方式表达：如果基督还在坟墓里，你们仍然在罪中。为什么？

因为复活证明，有一件事情已经结束了。什么结束了？《罗马书》4 章 25 节说：“耶稣被交给人，是为我们的过犯；复活，是为叫我们称义。”这是什么意思？

意思是：每当你看见死亡、每当你靠近死亡、每当你去参加一个你认识之人的葬礼——不管那人是谁——尽管这个社会一直告诉你“死亡是自然的，是人生的一部分”，但你心里知道：死亡并不“自然”。

死亡是不自然的，死亡不对劲。我们不想死，我们也不想看见所爱的人死去。我们心里知道，这件事哪里不对劲。

死亡禁止我们复起，而我们却渴望复起；死亡把我们往下拖，而我们却渴望被托起。死亡不对劲。这就是为什么狄兰·托马斯那句名诗会那么有名：“人们对光阴的消逝心怀愤怒。”我们愤怒，我们知道死亡并不自然。但如果它不自然，那它就是被加在我们身上的；如果它是被加在我们身上的，那就是一种审判，一种刑罚。

为什么会有这样的刑罚？圣经给出答案：我们被安置在一个有秩序的世界里——这个世界被造出来，是要在人不为自己而活、而是为他人、为上帝而活的时候，才能正常运作。我们被造出来，是要服事他人、敬拜与服事上帝。但我们并不是这样活的。我们是为自己而活，用别人、也用上帝来满足自己的需要、成就自己的目标。

结果，世界就不再运转如常，我们自己也开始崩坏；死亡成了自然而然的结果。我们在违背现实的经纬和纹理顺序地而活，这样活的工价就是解体，而解体就是死亡。所以死亡有权柄，死亡是一种审判。

如果耶稣基督只是死了，如果他没有复活，那死亡就仍然“有债可收”，死亡仍然“有权可行”。但当耶稣基督复活的时候——我们刚刚唱过那首赞美诗——“死亡徒然禁止他复起”（death in vain forbids him rise）。后面那首诗歌也说到一样的意思：死亡无能为力。为什么？

因为公义已经得着满足，审判已经执行完毕。耶稣基督在死的时候，已经完成了一切必须完成的代价，所以死亡再也不能对他、对属他的人有什么权利、权柄。它对我们再无权柄、再无权威。所以定罪结束了。复活意味着“定罪结束了”。复活意味着：你的罪已经得偿付，上帝已经满足，已经接纳你了。

如果你回到旧约，会看到每年有一次，全体百姓聚集在一起，大祭司在赎罪日进入幔子里面。幔子后面是什么？是至圣所。他要去哪儿？他要进去，为百姓的罪献上赎罪祭。

所有人都很紧张。为什么？因为他是走进上帝赤裸的同在里。那献祭会不会被接纳？所有的人都屏住呼吸等候，他几乎像是踏上了一条“必死之路”，走进幔子后面。但年复一年，每当他献完祭出来，再从幔子中走出来的时候，所有人都会欢呼：为什么？因为这意味着他们的罪已经得到赎罪。

但那一切都是年年重复的。正如《希伯来书》所说，那样的献祭从来不能彻底让人的良心得到安息、得到完全的满足。可当耶稣基督进入地里，又从地里出来时，那就是上帝向全世界宣告：“你们的罪，已经完全付清了。”

因此，一方面——若没有复活——你就绝对没有把握，相信上帝此刻看你是满意的，是接纳你的；但另一方面，复活不仅证明“有一件事已经结束了”，它也证明“有一件新事已经开始了”。

后面 20 到 23 节讲的就是这一点。这里两次说到：耶稣基督是“初熟的果子”。什么叫“初熟的果子”？

意思是：有一个世界，那个世界是永恒的世界，是完全公义的世界，是完全有爱的世界，是一个没有衰老、没有死亡、没有腐坏的世界，是一个充满生命、真理与美的世界。那是“理想的世界”；而我们现在所身处的，是“现实的世界”。人人心里都知道，理想世界和现实世界之间，隔着一块“混凝土”的厚墙。

但当耶稣从死里复活时，这不只是“放烟花”，不只是上帝能力的一次表演；而是“理想世界”冲破那堵墙，闯入“现实世界”——耶稣基督是“初熟的果子”。

那什么是“初熟的果子”？是田里收成的第一批，是葡萄园里长出来的第一串，是收割谷物时的第一捆。它是真实收成的一部分，即便“丰收还没完全来到”。它意味着：后面整场收成一定会来——那是一个“开端”，但已经是“实物”。

这就意味着：上帝未来的世界，已经登陆了。借着复活，在这堵冷酷无情的世界之墙上，被凿开了一个洞；在一个充满朽坏的世界里，不朽涌入进来；在一个黑暗的世界里，光照了进来。

当耶稣基督说：“信我的人，必得着复活的生命”，这并不只是说：你会更受鼓舞一点、开心一点，他会给你一点力量去过好今天。不是只是这样的一点点安慰，好像“打打气、加加油”那样。

不，抬起你的眼睛，放下你那点小小的志向。圣经说，教会和基督徒是上帝“末世性登陆点”（eschatological beachhead）——也就是说，上帝的未来已经在此登陆。虽然只是“部分的”，却是真实的；是“初熟的”，但真的是“果子”。

所以，当你成为基督徒的时候，圣灵的果子就进入你的内心；圣灵的恩赐也进入你的生命。当你心里有真实的、来自未来的喜乐、爱与荣耀，你就会发现：当你用属灵的恩赐去爱人、去辅导人、去见证、去教导的时候，你是在把“将来的生命”带进别人的生命里。

这个世界中的“疏离感”——我们在属灵上与上帝疏离，在心理上与真正的自我疏离，在社会上与其他种族、阶级和民族疏离——这些疏离，都会开始被医治。而这一切，都是因为复活带来的“未来生命”已经赐给了你。

所以，当保罗在一封公开流传的信里，把话说到这种地步——“有五百多位见证人，如果你愿意，可以去问他们。他们都曾在同一时间，看见耶稣在复活之后向他们显现”——他到底在做什么？

他是在说：这件事很关键。你是否相信它真实发生，极其关键。

纽约一般人会觉得“复活”是个很美好的概念，是一个象征：象征善终将战胜恶，象征在人生大灾难之后你仍然可以翻开新的一页。如果你想要这种理解的一个小例子，看今天《纽约时报》的头版社论就行了。大意就是：“基督徒一直在庆祝这样一件事：曾经有一个人挺身而出，反抗暴政。”

按理说，基督徒不该太玻璃心，否则这会是一种侮辱——正因为我们不该玻璃心，所以也就不算侮辱。但保罗在这里非常郑重地告诉你：如果你只过着一个安逸、自得的小日子，把“复活”当作一个象征——象征“好事最终会压过坏事”——也许在那样的生活里，它还能给你一点点安慰。

可一旦你的人生里面出现的是具体的难处、具体的试炼、具体而真实的死亡威胁向你逼近，那么，除非你相信有一个具体的、真实的、物理的、历史上的复活，否则你这个人不会真正被改变。你没有办法面对真正的苦难，除非你相信有一个真正的复活。

你不能说自己只把复活当作一个美丽的象征，却不相信它在历史中客观、肉身地发生过。保罗刻意强调这一点，就像第 20 节那样：“但基督已经从死里复活。”这就是为什么我们不只是说“他复活了”，而是说：“他确实复活了，真实地、实际上复活了。”他的身体重新活了，他走出了坟墓。

保罗在这里说，他之所以在开头铺陈那么多经文，是因为：除非你相信这件事真实发生，否则复活不会在你生命中产生任何真正的改变。这是第一点。

第二点，他不仅说你必须相信复活发生过，还说你必须相信、必须明白复活成就了什么。复活不只是“有那么一件事发生了”，它不只是一次赤裸的能力展示，它成就了一些事。

那到底成就了什么呢？

保罗提到至少两件复活所成就的事。第一件，他在第 17 节说（可惜我没有把这节经文印在讲义上）：他说，“若基督没有复活，你们的信便是徒然，你们仍在罪里。”

事实上，他用的表达非常形象：如果基督还在地里，你们仍然在罪中。为什么会这样？因为复活证明“有一件事已经结束了”。什么结束了？

《罗马书》4 章 25 节说：“耶稣被交给人，是为我们的过犯；复活，是为叫我们称义。”这是什么意思？

意思是：每当你看见死亡、走近死亡、参加一个你认识之人的葬礼——不管那人是谁——尽管这个社会会告诉你：“死亡是自然的，是人生正常的一部分”，可你心里知道并不是这样。

死亡是不自然的，死亡不对。我们不想死，也不想看见挚爱的人死去。死亡里有某种“反常”的东西。死亡禁止我们起来、禁止我们复起，可我们却渴望复起；死亡把我们往下拉，可我们内心渴望被托起。死亡不对劲。

这就是为什么狄兰·托马斯那句名句那么有名：“我们对光阴的消逝心怀愤怒。”我们愤怒，因为我们知道死亡并不自然。但如果死亡不自然，那它就是被加在我们身上的；既然是被加在我们身上的，那它就是审判，是刑罚。

为什么会有这样的刑罚？圣经给出答案：我们被放在一个有结构、有秩序的世界里，这个世界之所以能良好运转，是在人不为自己活、而是为他人、为上帝而活的时候。我们被造出来，是要去服事他人、敬拜并服事上帝。

可我们并不是这样活的。我们为自己而活，用别人、也用上帝来满足自己的需要、成就自己的目标。结果，世界不再正常运转，我们自己也不再正常运转。死亡就成了一个“自然的结果”。

我们在违背现实的经纬、纹理而活，这样活的工资就是解体，而解体就是死亡。因此死亡就有了权柄，死亡成了审判。

当耶稣基督死的时候，保罗说：如果他没有复活，你们仍然在罪里。为什么？原因在这里：如果耶稣基督只是死了，那死亡身上仍然有“未收回的债”，死亡仍然“有帐可算”。

可当耶稣基督从死里复活的时候，我们刚刚唱的诗歌已经说了：“死亡徒然禁止他复起。”后面那首诗歌也讲同样的事情：死亡无能为力。为什么？因为公义已经得着满足，审判已经完成。

耶稣基督在死的时候，已经作成了一切该作的事。因此，“死亡徒然禁止”——死亡再没有能力，死亡再没有权柄辖制我们。于是，定罪结束了。你看，复活意味着“定罪已经终结”。复活意味着你的罪已经全部得着偿付，上帝已经满意、已经接纳你。

其实，如果你回到旧约，有一年一度的日子，众百姓都聚集起来——那就是赎罪日（Yom Kippur）。那一天，大祭司要做什么？他要进入幔子里面。幔子后面是什么？是至圣所。他要去哪儿？他要进去，为百姓的罪献上赎罪祭。

所有人都紧张极了。为什么？因为他要进入上帝赤裸、无遮掩的同在里。那献祭会不会蒙悦纳？所有人都屏住呼吸等候着。他走进去，几乎就像踏上了一条必死之路，走过幔子。但每一年，当他献完祭，再从幔子后面出来的时候，众人就欢呼：为什么？因为这意味着他们的罪已经得了赎。

但那是年复一年、一次又一次的。正如《希伯来书》所说，那样的献祭从来不能完全满足人的良心。

可是，当耶稣基督进入地里，又从地里出来时，那就是上帝向世人宣告的一种方式：“你们的罪，已经完全付清。”

因此，一方面，若没有复活，你就绝对没有把握，相信上帝此刻看你是满意的、是接纳你的。但另一方面，复活不仅证明“有一件事已经结束了”，也证明“有一件事已经开始了”。

20 到 23 节就是在讲这个：那里两次说到，耶稣基督是“初熟的果子”。

什么叫“初熟的果子”？嗯，我们可以这样理解：有那么一个世界，是永恒的世界，是完全公义的世界，是完全有爱的世界，是一个没有老去衰败、没有死亡腐坏的世界，是一个充满生命、真理与美的世界。但那个世界是“理想的世界”，而我们现在所处的是“现实的世界”。

人人心里都知道，理想世界与现实世界之间隔着一块厚厚的“混凝土板”。但当耶稣从死里复活的时候，那不是烟花表演，不只是一次能力的裸露展示，而是那个“理想世界”冲破厚墙，闯入“现实世界”。耶稣基督就是那“初熟的果子”。

什么叫“初熟的果子”？就是花园里最先结出来的果子，是田里收割的第一捆，是葡萄树上最先熟的那一串。它预告着后面整个丰收要来，它本身就是真实的收成的一部分，虽然丰收尚未完全来到。

这意味着什么？意味着上帝的未来已经登场。借着复活，那堵冷酷无情的世界之墙被凿开了一个洞；在这个充满朽坏的世界里，不朽进来了；在这个黑暗的世界里，光照了进来。

当耶稣基督说：“信我的人要得着复活的生命”，这不是说：你会被鼓舞一下、开心一点，他给你一点力量熬过这一天。不是仅仅如此。

圣经说，基督徒和教会是上帝“末世性的滩头堡（beachhead）”。这是什么意思？“末世性”就是指上帝的未来世界已经在现在闯进来了。虽然只是部分，却是真实的；是“初熟的果子”，但的确是“果子”。

现在，当你成为基督徒的时候，圣灵的果子就进入你的心；圣灵的恩赐进入你的生命；真正属神、来自未来的喜乐、爱与荣耀进入你的心。

当你带着圣灵的恩赐去关心别人、辅导别人、向人作见证、教导人的时候，你其实是在把“将来的生命”带进别人的生命里。

这个世界的种种疏离——我们在属灵上与上帝疏离，在心理上同真实的自我疏离，在社会上与其他种族、阶层、民族疏离——这些疏离，会开始借着圣灵所赐的恩赐，被渐渐医治。而这一切，都是因为“未来”已经临到你身上了。

你是不是在找一些方式，好好利用这个夏天，在信仰上成长？或者，你希望帮助一些初信者或孩子，抓住基督信仰的核心？对我们许多人来说，夏天往往让我们有更多时间，去加深对信仰的理解、对“跟随基督”到底意味着什么的体会。

一个非常好的工具，就是《新城市要理问答灵修本》（The New City Catechism Devotional）——“上帝给我们心与意的真理”。这本灵修书把教会历史上的要理问答重新呈现在今天的读者面前，一年 52 周，每一周有一道问题，帮助你思考基督信仰的根基。

在序言中，Tim Keller 论证了“要理教导”的重要性——那是一种丰富又群体性的操练：通过学习和背诵问题与答案，把基督信仰的根本真理，深深刻在我们的心思意念中。

每一周都有一段经文、一篇祷告和一小段默想，既会挑战你，也会激励你。书中所收录的讲解文章，既包括当代的牧者（例如 John Piper、Tim Keller、Kevin DeYoung 等），也包括历史上的信仰前辈（如奥古斯丁、加尔文、马丁·路德等）。

本月，只要你奉献支持《福音与生活》的事工，帮助我们把基督之爱的盼望带给世界各地的人，我们都会把这本《新城市要理问答灵修本》，以及一本非常适合搭配使用的《新城市要理问答（儿童版）》，作为答谢礼物寄给你。

现在，让我们继续把时间交给 Tim Keller，来听今天讲道的后半部分。

复活把“未来”带进了“现在”；复活也把“称义”赐给了你。那么，什么已经结束了呢？定罪和审判，已经永远结束了。那什么已经开始了呢？是国度——这是 20 到 24 节在讲的。“初熟的果子”是什么？是国度。先是“初熟的果子”，然后最终是“完全的国度”。20 到 24 节讲的就是这个。

现在，让我们来到最后一点，因为保罗说这一切，其实都是为了引出结尾。在结尾处，他在问：好，那么这一切对我们的生活有什么意义？我很喜欢 58 节（或 59 节）里的那句话：“所以，我亲爱的弟兄们，你们务要坚固，不可摇动，常常竭力多做主工。”

“所以”——这个“所以”是承接什么？我们稍微停一下。

你是如何面对人生的苦难的？你如何变得刚强？你如何面对生命中的各种艰难？你怎样成为一个不会轻易被动摇的人，成为一个“站得稳的人”？保罗在这里讲的就是这个。

那要怎么做呢？我们如何面对人生的苦难？是不是只要“咬咬牙，坚持一下”？是不是只要说：“我要坚强。我是基督徒，这些事不会把我打垮”？

保罗不是这样讲的。他没有说：“咬咬牙，让任何事情都不能动摇你。”那“所以”到底是承接什么？它是承接整章《哥林多前书》15 章的神学。

你看，当保罗说“我希望你成为一个刚强的人”的时候，他不是叫你直接去跟世界硬碰硬；他是说：“要思想。”要让你思想，直到上帝所成就之事的荣耀压倒你。这个过程是非常“整体性”的：先让你的理性被调动起来，直到你的心被点燃、洋溢，最后你的意志就变得不可动摇、极其坚强。

所以，当保罗在这里用一个小小的连词“所以”的时候，其实是把你带回整章《哥林多前书》15 章——他真正要做的是：把复活的真理按进你的心里。

我们大多数人面对苦难的方式，其实就是“硬扛”，是一种完全斯多葛式的方式——我们直接去挤压自己的意志力。但保罗不是这样。保罗说：你需要“盼望”。而盼望只能从一件事来——那就是你真正明白“这复活确实发生过，并且明白它成就了什么”。

我最爱的故事人物之一是《魔戒》中的山姆（Sam Gamgee）。书中有一段写到：他已经到了自己能承受的极限。他抬头仰望星空，看见了一幕景象：

“他从藏身之处爬出来，往外眺望。大地到处都是嘎吱作响、阴险诡秘的声音。他正处在极其危险的境地……这时，他看见在高山上的阴暗堡垒上方、云层的破口之间，有一颗白星在闪烁。星辰的美刺透了他的心。他在这被弃绝之地抬头仰望，希望又回到了他的心里。就像一支清澈而寒冷的箭，一道思想刺透了他：‘最终，一切黑暗只是一个渺小而会过去的东西。高处有光，有崇高的美，永远在黑暗的势力之外。’”

“他先前在高塔中的歌唱，更像是一种‘对抗’，而不是出于‘盼望’，因为那时他想的是自己。如今，在那一刻，他不再被自己的命运所困扰。”

他重新爬回荆棘丛中，躺下身来，把一切惧怕都搁下，坠入一种深沉而无扰的睡眠。”

这里面有很多细腻的描写。你看，之前山姆之所以能“坚强”，其实靠的是一种“对抗”，靠的是直接挤压自己的意志力；但到这里，作者说，那其实是一种“自我专注”——不断对自己说：“我不会垮，我要坚强，我要扛过去。”

可这一次，他得着的是“盼望”。什么是盼望？是一种“思想刺透了他的心”。“像一支清澈而寒冷的箭，一道思想刺透了他：最终，一切黑暗只是一个渺小而会过去的东西；高处有光，有崇高的美，永远在黑暗的势力之外。”

如果耶稣基督的复活并未真实发生，这样的描写不过是“黑暗中吹口哨壮胆”而已。但如果复活真的发生了，我劝你像山姆仰望那颗星星一样，定睛仰望复活，直到那支“箭”也刺透你的心——那时，你就会成为一个“不可动摇”的人。

那时，很多事情再也不能真正困扰你了。让我很快地举几样经文里提到的事，来说明哪些事将不再能摇动你。

第一，你的罪和你的缺陷不会再把你击倒。你相信复活吗？如果耶稣已经从死里出来，那就意味着上帝此刻看你，是满意的，是接纳你的——你的罪和缺陷就不再能把你压垮。

你会问：这怎么运作呢？想象你在梅西百货买了东西。梅西是个巨大的商场，假设你买了一样很大的物件，放不进任何袋子，你得直接把它抱着，从楼里一直走到街上。

你一旦走到街上就没问题了，可在路上，你知道会发生什么？会有人拦住你，要你出示发票。为什么？因为如果有保安或销售人员拦住你，问：“你拿着这个干嘛？”你只要把发票亮出来，就可以说：“别来烦我。我已经付过钱了。我不欠一分钱。我完全清白自由。”

什么是复活？复活就是你的“收据”。因为你一定会被质问——你会被世界质问，会被肉体质问，也会被魔鬼质问。那些问题会这样出现：

“要是别人知道你在主日敬拜的时候，心里冒出过什么念头就好了。我在礼拜堂里却开始对那边某个挺吸引人的人胡思乱想，天啊，我居然在教会里这样想。”

你自己的心也会跳出来说：“你凭什么以为神会爱你？为什么神要爱你？”当你的心开始往下沉的时候，你就把那张“收据”拿出来——那就是耶稣基督的复活——然后说：“别来烦我。别来烦我。代价已经付清了。我自由清白。”

你可以对世界、对肉体、对自己的心、对魔鬼说：“你们不要再鞭打我，我自己也不会再鞭打自己。因为他已经复活，那就是我的收据，说明一切债务已经全数偿清。”

所以，不要让你的罪和缺陷把你压倒，不要让它们动摇你，不要让它们把你摔出去。你要让“任何事都不能摇动你”。

其次，不要让“人生的暧昧与复杂”把你击倒。这听上去可能有点奇怪，但我简单说一下。

如果你真正明白“复活”的教义，特别是圣经所说复活是“初熟的果子、但仅仅是初熟的果子”，你就会明白：上帝的未来确实已经登陆，这意味着有惊人的能力可以改变很多事；但这仍然只是“初熟的”，仍然只是开始。上帝的完全荣耀还没有全然降临，世界上仍然充满了破碎，仍然充满了死亡，各种问题仍然很多。

那这意味着什么？这意味着，有些人在面对人生时，看见各种失望、各样悲剧，就开始把心硬起来。他们会说：“你看，人生就是这么糟。”于是就放弃盼望，变得愤世嫉俗，说：“还能指望什么呢？”他们把自己变硬，是因为不想再被失望伤害。

但基督徒不该这样。基督徒对这个世界、对自己，是带着“不满足的耐心”的——因为我们有盼望。若你有盼望，你就会着急地说：“你可以比现在好得多。”你对朋友这么说，对自己这么说，对这座城市也这么说：“纽约啊，你可以比现在好太多了。”这不是愤世嫉俗，而是一种带着盼望的不满足。

同时，基督徒也不会接受那种“廉价的答案”。基督徒很清楚，这个世界仍然有许多破碎。因此，基督徒不该是那种“天真烂漫、眼睛睁得大大的、总是充满鸡汤”的人，也不该是那种愤世嫉俗的人。

我们不会满世界说：“一切都是祝福，只要信耶稣，你的生活就会完全变好，会有大复兴。”那不是复活的教义。圣经说，我们现在只有“初熟的果子”，就这样而已。这个世界仍然有许多破碎。

可是，基督徒有一套神学，能让我们以其他人做不到的方式，来理解“人生环境的暧昧与复杂”。因此，我们能对这种“处境的复杂性”有极大的包容度——注意，不是对“真理信仰”含糊，而是对人生处境的复杂性有包容。

我们既不愤世嫉俗，也不天真烂漫；既能带着喜乐的幽默感，又能谦卑、勇敢，同时也随时准备听见上帝说“不”。你准备好了吗？

你知道吗，很多人是在“天真”与“愤世嫉俗”之间来回摆动的；这在基督徒身上也常见。许多基督徒一开始非常天真，以为“一切都会好起来”，后来发现事情并非如此，于是就变得极度愤世嫉俗——那是因为他们没有好好听这篇关于复活的讲道。

最后第三，不要让死亡把你击倒。不要让你的罪把你击倒，不要让人生的暧昧与复杂把你击倒，但也不要让死亡把你击倒。

历史记载，当瘟疫在第一、二、三世纪席卷罗马帝国各大城市时——那时人们还不知道“细菌理论”，但他们知道：如果一直和病人待在一起，自己也会死。那几次大瘟疫，很可能是天花，极其可怕：在罗马大城市里，大约有 25% 到 33% 的人口死于那些瘟疫。

史书告诉我们：当瘟疫来临时，那些有能力的异教徒会立刻逃离城市；而且在那时，哪怕是你的亲人，一旦染病，往往还没断气就已经被抛到街上。

但基督徒却没有离开。基督徒不仅留下来照顾自己家中的病人，还去把异教徒的病人也从街上抱起来，回家照顾他们——那些病人的脓血、恶臭就那样沾满在他们手上，而他们心里却知道：这很可能意味着自己也会染病、会死。

可是，他们仍然留下来了。历史学家会告诉你：正因为基督徒留下来，不惧怕死亡，去爱那些患病、临死、贫穷的人——不仅爱自己的弟兄姊妹，也同样爱异教邻舍——这对古罗马社会产生了极大的震动，使基督徒在众人眼里显得格外可信。

但问题是：为什么他们留下，而异教徒逃走？你也许会说：“大概基督徒比较善良吧？”不，他们之所以留下，是因为他们相信复活。他们的心已经像山姆仰望星星那样，被“复活的真理”刺透了。

他们环顾四周，看见压迫、疾病、死亡，却仍然说：“这一切黑暗不过是渺小而会过去的东西。高处有光，有崇高的美，永远在黑暗的势力之外。”因着复活，他们知道那光存在，因此他们可以说：“就算我死又如何？来吧，死亡，你尽管施展全力。你所能做得最糟，不过就是把我带进那光里。”

正如乔治·赫伯特所说：“死亡曾是刽子手，但福音只让它成了园丁。”

基督徒之所以把病人抱回家，还有另一个原因：复活不只是让你不再惧怕死亡、不再惧怕受苦，它也告诉你：“身体是重要的。”

耶稣基督从天来到地上，不是为了把我们从身体里“解放出来”，而是为了修复身体。耶稣基督取了人的身体，又带着身体从死里复活，而不是抛弃身体。换句话说，不只是“灵魂”，连“身体”也在上帝救赎的计划当中。

如果耶稣基督要付出这么大的代价，从天来到地上，不仅要拯救你的灵魂，还要救赎你的身体，那么，当基督徒看见饥饿的人、贫穷的人、疾病缠身的人，又怎可能袖手旁观？

这也是为什么我们在复活节会特别为穷人、为城市的需要献上特别奉献——因为复活告诉我们，上帝不只要拯救灵魂，也要医治身体。基督徒被呼召，不只是“救人的灵魂”，也要为生命的每一个层面带来医治，面对罪所带来的一切败坏层面。

所以，“让什么都不能动摇你”。明白这些之后，你就会成为一个不轻易被摇动的人。让我们祷告。

“父啊，我们求你，使我们成为这样的、坚固稳妥的人——因为那刺透心的盼望已经在我们里面。不是靠咬牙硬扛，不是靠斯多葛式的自制，而是让真理击中我们的心，让我们被你所成就之事的荣美所压倒，好叫我们像那些改变了古罗马世界的人一样，也能在今天的世界中成为改变的器皿。让我们成为复活的人。奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。”

往往还没断气，人就被丢到街上。可基督徒却没有离开。基督徒不仅留下来照顾自己家中的病人，也把异教徒的病人抱起来，带回家中照顾——那些病人的疮口流着脓，就这样沾在他们手上，而他们心里却知道：这很可能意味着自己也会染病、会死。但他们仍然留下来。

历史学家会指出：正因为基督徒留下来、不惧怕、去照顾病人、垂死者和穷人——不仅照顾自己人，也照顾异教徒——这对社会产生了极大的影响，使得基督徒在世人面前变得极有“可信度”。这对罗马社会的影响是巨大的。

但问题是：为什么他们留下，而异教徒逃走？你也许会说：“因为基督徒人比较好。”不，他们之所以留下，是因为他们相信复活。复活的真理像箭一样刺透了他们的心。

他们环顾四周，看见压迫、疾病、死亡，却仍然说：“这些黑暗不过是渺小而会过去的东西，与那永远在其之外的光和崇高的美相比，不过如此。”因为复活真实发生，他们知道那光真实存在。因此，他们可以说：“就算我死又怎么样？来吧，死亡，你尽管施展全力。你所能做的最糟结果，不过就是让我变得更好。”

正如乔治·赫伯特所说：“死亡曾是刽子手，但福音只让它成了园丁。”

他们把病人抱回来的另一个原因，是因为复活不仅让我们不再畏惧死亡、愿意面对苦难，也告诉我们：“身体是重要的。”

耶稣基督从天来到地上，不是要把我们从身体中“解放出来”，而是要修复我们的身体。耶稣取了人的身体，也带着身体从死里复活，而不是丢弃身体。换句话说，不只是灵魂，身体也在上帝救赎计划的对象之中。

如果耶稣基督愿意付出如此之大的痛苦，从天上到人间，不只是为要救赎你的灵魂，也为要救赎你的身体，那么，当基督徒看见饥饿的人、贫穷的人、疾病缠身的人，又怎么可能无动于衷？

这也是为什么我们在复活节会为穷人、为城市的需要献上“特别奉献”——因为复活意味着，上帝不只是要拯救你的灵魂，也要医治你的身体。

基督徒被差遣出去，不只是要“拯救人的灵魂”，而是要为生命的每一个层面带来医治，要在那里面对罪所带来的每一个维度的败坏。

听好了：“让什么都不能摇动你。”你明白这些到什么程度，你就能被动摇到什么程度；你若深深明白这一切，你就会成为一个几乎不能被动摇的人。

我们一起祷告——

“父啊，我们求你，使我们成为这样刚强、稳固、不被撼动的人——是因为那像箭一样刺透我们心的盼望，而不是靠着一种对抗世界的硬扛、不是靠咬牙坚持、不是靠斯多葛式的苦撑，而是让真理击中我们的心，让我们被你所成就之事的荣美所压倒。好叫我们像那些改变了古代罗马世界的人一样，今天也能在这个城市里带来改变。让我们成为复活的人。奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。”
