## English Transcript / 英文原文

Today, on Gospel and Life, Tim Keller shows us that the Bible has incredibly helpful  and practical wisdom we can apply to the work we do. Some you may find surprising, even life-changing. Ephesians 6. We're going to read verses 5 through 9. Something about the subject, please.

We had a long series on marriage, as you know, as we got to Ephesians 5. And last week in this week, I've just decided to move on through quickly two very important  subjects, not necessarily the most inspiring subjects, not the kind of sermons or preaching  that everybody comes out saying, wow, that was so inspiring. The one subject is the relationships of parents to children, that was last week. And today, the relationships within the workplace of master to servant, of employer, of manager  to worker. Now, we're going to look at that tonight, and this will be the only night we talk about  again, and I'll get back to it in a second.

Again, it's not the most inspiring subject, and yet, it is so important, because when you  stop and consider how much of your time, how much of your life is built around your work,  and when you consider that the average Christian, when they, he or she sits down to try to say,  what does it mean for me to live my life out as a Christian? If somebody gives you a book on discipleship, here's what it means to be a disciple of Jesus,  here's what it means to be a Christian and to walk as a Christian. You will find, if you look carefully, that basically, that's really telling you, most  almost all that material, and I had to know I've written some of it, so I'm part of it. Almost all that material tells you how to be a Christian in the evenings and on the weekends. And since so many of you work on Saturday and get home at 10 o'clock at night, there's  really not a lot of time in which you can be a Christian, because you see, nobody's  telling you how to be a Christian on the job and in your work.

So we have to look at it. I need to say, though, like I said, it's not so much inspiring material as it is important  material, it's material that takes all of your wisdom to apply. It's not going to be easy to apply, but you have to say, unless I get this, unless I get  the hang of this, there's large sections of my life in which I'm not really letting  Christ impact my behavior. Starting next week, we're going to start a series, we're going to get down to chapter  six, verse 10. And I'm just letting you know that we're going to start another series.

Basically, this is a series of series with a couple of connector things, like the one  this week we're doing, but when we get down to verse 10 where it says, finally, be strong  in the Lord and in his mighty power, put on the full armor of God so that you can take  your stand against the devil's schemes, for our struggle is not against flesh and blood  but against the rulers, against the authorities and against powers of this dark world and  against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms, therefore put on the full  armor of God. We're going to take a lot of time to look at that. I think that there is a tremendous amount of teaching in this passage, it's actually  verse 10 to 20 of chapter six. It's about spiritual warfare, it's about supernatural evil, it's about, it's actually in many  ways, about what it means to live the Christian life militarily. And it doesn't mean that Christian is somebody who likes war, doesn't mean that Christian  is somebody, a hawk in the Gulf War, what we're talking instead of is a Christian, is a person  who is absolutely realistic about the nature of life.

Christians do not look through their life at life through rose colored glasses because  the Bible is not a set of rose colored glasses. The Bible says the Christian can be known as much for the fight in his life as for the  peace in his life. In fact there is a certain sense in which the way the real difference in a Christian  and non-Christian is not that a Christian has got a life of peace and non-Christian life  of conflict, but rather that when you become a Christian, places you had conflict, you  develop peace and places you had peace, you develop conflict. What happens is the battle moves around and Christianity is by no means, like I said  sentimental, it says a Christian is somebody who knows that it's a very, very difficult,  dangerous world out there. You expect to be shot at all the time.

You're never running home saying, you know as Elizabeth Eliot once said, if you're in  the ring and you got the box or trunks on, don't come running back to the guy in the  corner saying, that man hit me. Because your coach will say, if you don't want to get hit, get out of the ring. Being a Christian means you're in the ring. You can't complain about the fact that you come home every day bloody. A Christian is somebody who instead of saying that man hit me, a Christian says, I've got  to get on, the armor, I've got to get prepared, I've got to see what it is.

So we're going to spend a pretty good amount of time talking about the fact that Christianity  is a fight. One great book on the Christian life by John White, it's an interversely pressed book. Many of you may know it's one of the best overall books to give somebody who wants to understand  what does it mean to live a Christian life. It's called the fight. He's realistic, okay?

Now, but today, tonight, I would just look at briefly, but at another area where there's  a lot of fighting going on, even if it's not outside, it's certainly inside. And I'd like to look at Ephesians 6, and I'm just going to read verses 5 to 9, and map  out this evening some of the most basic principles of what back, what God tells you, you must  do in approaching work in a Christian way, in approaching your job. Let me just read from verses 5 to 9, slaves, you say, oh, this is me, okay. Obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as  you would obey Christ. Obey them, not only to win their favor, but when their eyes on you, but like slaves of  Christ, doing the will of God from your heart, serve wholeheartedly as if you were serving  the Lord, not men, because you know that the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good  he does, whether he is slave or free.

And masters treat your slaves in the same way, do not threaten them since you know that  he who is both their master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with  him. This is God's word, all right? Some general principles, then some practical, general and background, and then practical. This passage raises a lot of thorny issues, and fortunately since we're not making the  Christian and work a series, I'll just pass lightly on all of them, but again they're  important. Is you must keep in mind that this is another indication that Christianity is a whole  life religion, that Christianity has to touch every part of your life, that you're not  a Christian unless every part of your life has been completely reoriented.

Actually, this is another way of saying that a Christian doesn't do anything like a  non-Christian. Oh, a Christian does plenty of things that non-Christians do, but no, a Christian doesn't  do anything in the same way. Otherwise, why would Paul work out in such detail in every area of life? If you've been coming in the evening through Ephesians, you'll see that in every single  area of life, Paul says, this is what it means to be filled with a spirit, in communication. This is what it means in your marriage, this is what it means in your family, this is  what it means in your relationship to your parents in your workplace, this is what it  means in your social relationships, this is what it means in your understanding of culture  and so on.

Why would Paul say that unless a Christian in every area is doing things differently? That means that Christianity is not a Sunday thing or an evening thing. It's an all day, it's a whole life thing. That's the reason when Paul says, be filled with a spirit, he works out in every single  area of life. Secondly, you really got to keep in mind that Paul is still telling people what it means  to be filled with a spirit.

Now the trouble with long-winded preachers like myself is that it's been weeks and weeks. I forget. I do, and I think when we looked at verse 17 of chapter 5 and 18 where it says don't  be drunk with wine but be filled with a spirit, and then he goes on and says, being filled  with a spirit means that you talk to one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs  and you make melody in your heart to the Lord and you thank God for everything. Hmm. How did I do that?

Hmm. Oh, there we go. Wow, I got to be careful about that. That was the mic. That was not me, honest.

I should not. I didn't have supper. So, shoo, boy. I'm not that long-winded here. So anyway, long-winded.

When you're long-winded you might sometimes a minister like myself can make you lose track. Of the fact that Paul is still talking about what it means to be filled with a spirit  because in verse 21 he said, submit to one another. Then he begins to move into all areas of life to show how spirit filled people relate  to the people around them. Now, this should at least tell you this, especially those of you who have come out of churches  that put lots of emphasis on being filled with a spirit. I think we got to last week in the morning services was this.

When the Bible talks about what it means to be filled with spirit, it always talks about  the heart. The heart is affected by the spirit. Now, something that probably needs to be brought out all the time is in the Bible. The word heart does not really have the same meaning that it tends to have in English. In English, the word heart means the emotions.

The heart is something that's opposed to the head. That's the reason why Maria can say, my head tells me one thing, but my heart needs  to, my heart tells me that this is what I want to do. You see the heart and the head are put against one another. In the Bible, the word heart is the seat of the whole soul. That means you can think with your heart and you can will with your heart and you  can feel with your heart and you'll see different places in the Bible where it talks about  as a man thinketh in his heart and so forth.

The heart is the seat of the mind, the will and the emotions and the way you know that  the spirit of God is really affecting you in the heart is that your religion is not  just emotional. We talked about this a couple of weeks ago in the morning service, not just emotional  and not just volitional and not just intellectual. There's a very, very important thing to consider. Some of you know, some of you have been converted since you started coming to this church  and yet you were very religious before. Now, you're an interesting kind of person and very often sitting down, you can look  back and say, you know, my parents aren't going to believe this.

A lot of people aren't going to believe this because I've been in church for years  and yet I was never a Christian until I came here. And very often if you sit down and talk and you think about it, you'll be able to identify  that you didn't understand the gospel, but there was some signs. You should have been aware of it because in some cases your religion was nothing but  intellectual. That means you thought about the Bible and you knew a lot and you argued about it and  you got your thinking straight. And yet there was never any emotional sense of the presence of God, there was never any  passion, there was never any warmth, that's the emotional side.

And volitionally, that means in behavior, there was never much in the way of change going  on in your life. You couldn't say, well, I'm more loving than I was last year, I'm more patient than  I was last year, I'm more wise than I was last year. Then other folks say my life was a volitional one. That means I was a very dutiful, disciplined person, but there was no growth in my thinking  and I never since I had a real relationship with God, you see. Now many people may find that though they love worship and though they seem to be having  tremendous emotional experiences and they say, therefore, I must be filled with a spirit.

Yet when it comes down to it, Paul is saying, if there isn't a progressive transformation  in all of your living areas and your life relationships, you're not filled with the spirit. Being filled with the spirit is not a matter of crying at worship services. It's not a matter of super high emotions though, of course it includes those things, yes  it does, but you know, to be filled with the spirit, you know it, you feel it. But you can be thinking you're filled with the spirit and have an emotional experience  unless it's working out in the way in which you relate to people on the job, in the way  in which you relate to your parents and in all of these areas, unless those things have changed,  you're not filled with the spirit. Now that's the most, in some ways, the most obvious point of this passage and you'd  miss it completely unless you stand back and say, what is Paul saying?

You look at the context which is hard to see again when you come to this church because  I go on so slowly through the passage. The main point is you're not filled with the spirit unless you find that the way in which  you relate to people on the job has really been changed. Okay, now one more background area, one more background thing, a general thing, but it's  not important, it's not practical, but it's a big issue, you can't really go buy it. In fact, if I don't go buy it, somebody's going to come up and ask me about it afterwards  anyway. Does this passage condone slavery?

Now you see, there's been two kinds of enemies of the gospel who have really misused this  passage. One kind, unfortunately, enemies of the gospel, where people who didn't think they were  enemies of the gospel, they were people in the church, they were clergy who have used  this passage to say, yes, slavery is fine. And if you want to go back in the 1850s and the 1860s, you will find United States clergy  men, especially in the south, justifying the institution of slavery on the basis of this  passage. They say, hey, you know what it says to slaves, doesn't say get going? It says, oh, buy your masters.

It says you should, you see, well, there we go. And on the other hand, there's other people who have misused this. There's people who said, see, the Bible does condone slavery. And that just shows that the Bible is, you know, a good book in many ways, but basically  about where looking book, a primitive book, you know, a book with retrograde morality. This is an unworthy text.

And so there's a lot of good things in the Bible, but basically there's things in the Bible  that really are not good. There's things that are backward looking, that are bad that we have to reject, that are  immoral even. It supports this, it supports racism, it supports classism, it supports slavery and so on. Well, neither those folks are right, especially I have to say the latter people, it's an illogical  thing to say, since the Bible condemns slavery. And since we know slavery is wrong, therefore the Bible is characterized by inferior morality  at this point.

You see, friends, the Bible claims to be revelation from God. And if God has spoken, and if God has revealed Himself and said, this is what's right and  this is what's wrong, then there really can be absolute principles of morality that we  can say to everybody, no matter what you think, this is right and this is wrong. This is a universal absolute truth, this is objective truth just like the law of gravity,  you've got to believe it. But if there's no revelation, if there's no place that God has spoken and told us what  is right and wrong, then all morality is a matter of opinion, all morality. And I like to know where you get this high standard of morality by which you can judge  the Scripture, where does it come from?

You see, if there's no revelation, then it's a matter of opinion, and you might be, you  might have your opinion, but there's no way you could consider this inferior. You see that? You know, basis for saying so. Now, the fact is, the reason I know, and the reason you should know the slavery is wrong,  is because we believe the Bible's revelation. First, there's two things you've got to say about this passage in slavery.

First of all, no, of course it doesn't say in this spot, slaves go get loose. You've got to remember, again, the context, the context is, what does it mean to be filled  with the Spirit, and how is that going to affect tomorrow, every one of your relationships? It's natural and normal, in a sense, that the Bible never deals with a social issue  abstractly. It always deals with it from the standpoint of how does this relate to your relationship  with God? Yeah, again, a couple of weeks ago, we've pointed this out.

The Bible, in a sense, will not, this is in the morning service, so I'll bring this  up here. I mention this. The Bible, in a sense, does not even, well, not even, the New Testament will not even  talk to you about most issues until you decide what you think about Jesus. There's a sense in which it won't even let you get to other issues. People will say, well, I'm interested in being a Christian, but I don't know what I believe  about evolution.

Or they say, I'm interested in Christianity and I might be interested in Christ, but  I don't understand what it means by turning the other cheek. Or I like a lot of things, but I'm afraid if I become a Christian, that this is going  to change my politics one way or the other, or even a person says, I like to come to Christianity,  but I first have to find out what I would have to do in this or that area of my life. And there's a sense in which the New Testament says, there's no way we're going to answer  those questions. There's no way the New Testament writers say we're going to answer those questions. First, what do you think of him?

Now, the reason they do that is because they say if Christianity was basically an intellectual  philosophy, then you could have your answers to your philosophical questions before you  come to him. But if Christianity is essentially a relationship, a personal relationship, then you have to figure  out what you think of him, whether what he says about himself is true or not, and whether  you're going to accept or reject him, otherwise, everything else the New Testament says makes  no sense. It's silly to say, I don't know if Jesus is God, but I want to know what the Bible says  what Christianity says about slavery. It's ridiculous to even ask a question like that. The point is, if Jesus isn't God, who cares what the Bible says about slavery?

If Jesus isn't God, who cares what anybody thinks? It's all a matter of opinion. On the other hand, if Jesus is God, then we can talk. Once you understand that, once you accept him, once you receive him into your life, then  all sorts of things that he says will start to make sense, but not until then. See that?

The great illustration is that marriage is a complex thing, as you know, so we spent  nine weeks on it. There's all sorts of facets to it. And there's a lot of things that you do in marriage, a lot of issues, a lot of business  you do, but every so often, one person or the other, right? We'll suddenly stop and say, we can't do anything else because there's something wrong  with our relationship. We can't make this decision.

We can't go on this trip. We can't buy this thing because our relationship is a mess. We can't go any further until we get that straight. Why? Because marriage, ultimately, and first of all, is a personal relationship, right?

And it's only secondarily a financial or a business or a travel partnership. In the same way, Christianity says, first, first, first, you relationship with God, that's  the first issue. And that's why you never see Christianity almost dealing with any issue of a social  issue abstractly. The first thing Paul's going to say to slaves is, well, let's debate whether or not it's  right or wrong for you to leave, whether we should start an abolitionist movement. That's not the first thing he says.

The first thing he says is, tomorrow, if you're filled with the spirit, how's that going  to affect the way in which you deal with your master? That's why he's doing it that way. He's not condoning slavery here. He's talking about how slaves are going to live their lives tomorrow. He's immediate.

He's practical. And he's dealing with things from a God-ward relationship point of view. You absolutely have to remember that. And that's really critical. And by the way, and we'll say one more thing in a minute about slavery and Christianity,  one other thing is whatever God says to these people about how to conduct their work  life, whatever he says to these people, if it works for them, it probably ought to work  for you.

You can laugh about being slaves, but you're not. You can laugh at saying, I'm miserable, but you weren't as miserable as these people  where I can tell you that. You can laugh about being poorly paid and never worked, but these people are more poorly  paid and more overworked. You can grump about lack of independence. These people had a little less than you do.

If it works for these folks, it should work for you, okay? It's estimated that most of us spend half of our waking hours at work. How does the wisdom of the Bible apply to our careers? In other words, how can our work connect with God's work? And how can our vocations be more emotional?

In his book, every good endeavor, Tim Keller draws from decades of teaching on vocation  and calling to show you how to find true joy in your work as you serve God and others. The book offers surprising insights into how a Christian perspective on work can serve  as the foundation for a thriving career and a balanced personal life. Every good endeavor is our thank you for your gift to help Gospel and Life share Christ's  love with more people around the world. Visit gospelandlife.com-slash-give. That's gospelandlife.com-slash-give.

Now one more thing, and that is you can't find a verse actually that tells people that  there's nothing, you're not going to find a verse in the Bible that says we need to abandon  slavery. Not only that, you don't see a verse in the Bible that says whether or not you should  belong to a labor union, you're not going to find a verse that says a lot of things,  and here's the reason why, because what the Bible does is it lays down universal principles  that apply to everything. If it went after this or that social institution, it would end up with a detailed way. It's there'd be big sections of the Scripture that we could just say off, that doesn't apply  to us. Who got rid of slavery?

It was essentially, and I think most people would agree with this, most historians would  certainly agree with it. It was essentially Christians and evangelical Christians. There was a friend of mine who's now passed away, who was a history professor and a student  of history at Yale University, and he did his dissertation there on abolitionism in  the States. He says, you know, a historian doesn't think the way normal people do. He says a historian doesn't say, look at the abolition of slavery and say, why did people  put up with it that long?

How could those people have ever put up with slavery? It's amazing. It took so long for those people to abolish it. The historian asked the question, since everybody, everywhere, did it. As far back as human beings can ever remember, that the strong enslaved the weak, and the  conquerors enslaved the conquered, since everybody had done it from whenever.

Why did it ever get into anybody's mind that it was wrong? He started saying it's very difficult to understand. He says the point is that the people got the idea that it was wrong from the Bible. In Britain and here, in Britain, there was a man named William Wilberforce, who was a very  wealthy person, born in the lap of luxury, who lived in the early 19th century, and who  led a life-long battle to get it abolished in the British Empire. Why?

Because you see, William Wilberforce didn't necessarily find a verse about slavery one way  or the other instead. He found all the passage. He found the Ten Commandments. He found the golden rule. Love your neighbor as yourself.

Pay people wages. Treat every human being with dignity. And it's just very easy to see that every human being is an image of God. You don't have the right to own people, to sell people, to kill people, to say who's  going to marry who, and so forth, in that sense. And therefore, Christians understood that, and they got rid of it.

And that's the reason why you can say, you know, this passage can do in slavery, actually,  it doesn't abolish it. It doesn't condone. It's not talking about that. How do we know this slavery is wrong, though? Because we know, well, the Bible obviously is a backward-looking document.

If the Bible is a backward-looking document, if there is no revelation, you have no way  of judging what progress is, no way at all. It's a crap shoot. The deconstructionists know it. They're saying that. They're saying all beliefs are social constructions.

Basically, there's no right and wrong out. All beliefs come out of, you know, are socially constructed out of your own imagination  and basically out of communities. And if that's true, then which end is up? This end up, we don't know. There's no way of dealing with progress.

The reason I know this slavery is wrong is because the Scripture says so. Because Christianity lays out, you know, in a sense, Paul, even in this passage and other  places, if you look carefully, has sown the seed of his destruction. Now the practical, what we've got are several principles, actually two and only two. Let me tell them to you now and then go back and just elaborate on until we're finished. Let me tell them to you now.

There's two false views of work that this passage knocks down. First false view of work is that work is a curse and that leisure is the meaning of life. And here it tells us that you should be doing work as if it's the will of God and you should  be doing it from the heart. The second false view of work, so the first view is that work is a curse and leisure is  the meaning of life. The second false view of work is that work is the meaning of life.

And leisure is just something, you know, in other words, the first view says we work in order to really live. And the second view says we live in order to work. All I do, I just have enough leisure so I could just get back in there just enough so I don't completely kill myself. Leisure is my fulfillment, work is my fulfillment. Now I'm giving it to you in a nutshell, both of these things are very, very dangerous.

If work is a curse and leisure is the meaning of life, if that view of work gets into somebody or gets into a population,  gets into a society, what really happens, of course, is what is happening. One quarter of all human, well no, but actually I want to show you that in our culture,  both these false views of work are growing extremely fast because of the secularization of our society,  because God's out of the picture. If God's out of the picture, either leisure is the meaning of life or work is the meaning of life. Now if leisure is the meaning of life, and all I do, work is a curse and I don't really care whether I'm getting anything done,  whether I'm helping anybody, whether I enjoy what I'm doing, I just need to, I want to get enough dollars so I can really live. Do the things that I want.

In a situation like that, productivity goes down, pride in our work goes down, quality of product goes down. Do you know that today one quarter, studies show one quarter of all American workers are deeply ashamed of what they're producing in the workplace? That's deeply ashamed, okay? Three quarters of all people, three quarters of all people in the workplace say that the quality of the work at this place was better 10 years ago. That's pretty scary as well.

Well, what happens, of course, is to all society when that happens. And the third bad response or the third problem is dishonesty becomes routine when work is a curse. You don't have pride in your work, you don't see yourself as a servant of anybody, and therefore you're going to cut corners wherever you can. You're going to get whatever you can out of people. You're going to work strictly for the short term and getting the bucks, not for the long term, the good of the economy or the good of community or good of people.

Isn't that right? And so what you have is the great temptation of dishonesty over here on the left. That's an accident that I'm not talking about the left, but on my left hand, it could be on my right, I'm not talking about politics here. So on the one hand, work is a curse, however I must point out to some degree, it's a bit of a blue collar problem. But because on the other hand, we've got the other problem, that is where as people work in order to live, there's other people who live only to work.

Work as self fulfillment, work as the meaning of my life. Now the problem with this view and the problem that happens here is work, whereas it should be your dignity, it's become your definition. It's the thing that gives you even meaning in life. And of course, the great danger on this side is the danger of workaholism and burnout. And you see what's interesting is the temptation of dishonesty and the temptation to overwork are both stem from a lack of trust in God.

If you are dishonest to try to get more money, you're simply saying, I can't trust God to take care of me. On the other hand, if you are burning yourself out to work, in many cases again, you're saying, I can't really trust God to support and take care of me either. They both stem from a basically getting God out of the picture. Now let's talk about these two things briefly. And you see, on the one hand, the passage goes against the idea of work as a curse, it says, do your work as the will of God.

It gets rid of the view of work as self fulfillment, you see, because it's saying you're working for God. See, this person over here says, I'm working for the master. I'm just putting my time in. I'm working, you know, I've got the ball and chain on me, I'm just working for the money. Over here it says, I'm working for myself to fulfill myself, to know that I'm a great person, to know that I really can accomplish something.

And the Bible says, if you work for either for money or for yourself, the whole society will go down and you yourself will eventually break apart. So you have to transform, first of all, your view of work, it's not a curse, it's a calling. And then secondly, you have to transform the aim of your work. It's not a self fulfillment, but a service and stewardship of your gifts to please God. If you get those two things down, by and large, you're going to find an awful lot of your problems.

Not only in society, but in the workplace, we'll work themselves out. Now, I got a couple minutes, so let me go back and try to elaborate each of these a little bit. On the one hand, work as a curse. So that comes from the classical traditions, it comes from the Greeks and from the Romans. If anybody has read, if you read your Greek mythology close enough, you remember the little story of Pandora?

So this gave Pandora a box, when the world was perfect, there was no problems in the world. And so this gave Pandora a box and says, don't open that box, this is a real sexist myth anyway. We all know that because you know, you give it to a woman, so the woman is to blame. And at least in the in Genesis, the man and the woman do it together, and then they blame each other. Which we all know is absolutely realistic.

But in the Greek myth, it is a sexist myth. First of all, the woman is the one who's to blame and she's just too curious, she doesn't have self control. She lets her emotions get away with her. That's how the myth goes. The point I'm trying to make is, when she opens the box, all sorts of things come out.

The disease comes out, and death comes out, and hatred also, you know what else comes out? Work. Completely different approach to the Bible. The Bible tells us that work was there from the beginning, that Adminyve were put into the world to work,  and that you were built to work. You were built to get something, to take care of it, to cultivate it, to create.

You're made in the image of God who loves to create. You're made in the image of God who loves to take things and bring the best out of them. And if there was no sin in the world, you still have work. And in, as far as we know, in heaven, there's going to be work. Because you're built for it, and there can't be a real joy without it.

That's totally different than the Greek and Roman notion. See, the biblical understanding is that we were put here, and then sin happens through the man and the woman together. And all kinds of things come into the world, but work is not one of them. It was already there. It's not a curse.

It's cursed. Work has been cursed, but it's not a curse. Very important balance, but a very difficult one to maintain. Work is cursed. That's the reason why God says, to Adminyve, you're going to toil in the dust.

And you're going to try to cultivate the earth, and it'll never quite go right. And the thorns will come up. And that means no matter how good you are, and no matter how perfect your work environment is,  you're always going to find thorns coming up. Frustrations. Never able to quite do it.

But you cannot jump from that to saying, work is a curse. The Greek and the Roman idea. In fact, the Latin word for work, negotium, actually means non-leisure. It goes to show their idea was, work is a curse, and the best thing to do is get away from it, especially physical labor. Contrary to that, the Bible says, the first man was a gardener.

And the first man and woman were farmers. And they worked with their hands. Tremendous dignity given to work. Aristotle and Plato says, if you've got to work, you should never work with your hands. Do art.

And Vincent, what kind of art, right? Some of you get awfully dirty doing your art. I know that. Do music. Do philosophy.

Do politics. Anyway, the point is, you know, don't get dirty. Do politics. Oh, Aristotle, come on. The Bible says Adam and Eve worked in the garden.

But more than that, the Bible says that work is a calling. Now, what does that mean? It says so, it doesn't use that word here, though it's implied. It says so in first Corinthians, in several other places. Work is a calling.

A calling means that God has put things in you, given you abilities,  and that not that there's one job for you, but that there are a range of jobs that use those abilities  and you need to find your abilities so that you can use them as a signpost toward those  jobs that you will find that they will be fulfilling. There's a fulfillment there. Do you remember, for example, in Cherokee, it's a fire. Here you have two guys, Eric Little and Harold Abrams. And they're both working for the prize, and they're reaching for the prize, and they want  to be gold medalists in running.

They're doing the same thing, the same work and everything. Two quotes, Eric Little, at one point says to his sister, who's afraid he's not going  to go to missionary, to be a missionary in China, and eventually he did, of course, but he  says to her, Jenny, you've got to understand, I believe God made me for China, but he also  made me fast. And when I run, I feel his pleasure. See now there's a Christian view of work, too, both, remember I said there's a Christian  view of work, it's a calling, and the Christian aim of work, not for money and not for  yourself, but for him. What does he say?

First of all, there's the Christian view of work, God made me fast. And here's the Christian aim of work, when I run, I'm pleasing him, I feel his pleasure. Meanwhile, Harold Abrams says, I've never known contentment, I'm forever in pursuit, and  I don't even know what it is I'm chasing. Would you please answer me a very personal question? In your work right now, what is the language of your heart?

Do you say, man, when I do the thing I'm doing, I'm not doing it, but when I do the thing  I'm doing with all my might, I think I'm starting to find out who I really am. I'm finding myself. I feel his pleasure, or do you say, I'm working and working and working and working like  a dog? I don't even know what I'm working for, and there's no joy or contentment in it. Which are you closer to?

Now, I'll tell you this. If you're like Harold Abrams, then you have to look at these two things. One is you have to say, am I working only for money? Have I sold my soul for a massive potage? Is that what I've done?

More secondly, am I burning myself out and that gets us to the other thing? Because I'm trying to define myself in terms of my work, which is a more subtle problem  and a more difficult problem for Christians to deal with. If you say, hey, I don't think I'm doing that either, then thirdly, maybe you just  haven't really found the place that fits your gifts. You talk to people and find it. Well now, let me just talk briefly about that other side of things.

As I said, the work is a curse, leisure is the meaning of life. You've got to begin to realize you're not going to find yourself that way. You have to say, I am working as a steward of what God's given me, my gifts in the world. I am to be useful to people. That's what you work for, to be useful to people, to be a steward of the things that God's  given you, the world that He's given you, and the gifts that He's given you.

That's a calling. He's called you into that. And no matter who you are, no matter how high or how low, whether you're just a, quote,  a gardener or somebody sweeping, you see, as opposed to a philosopher, the biblical understanding  is whatever you do with all your might, you are pleasing Him and you are honoring Him. That's why Elizabeth Elliott, you've heard me say this, Elizabeth Elliott says, a clam  glorifies God better than you, she would say, why? Because a clam is doing exactly what it was built to do.

It is using its capacities, it's glorifying God by being a clam, it's glorifying God  by being a clam, it's perfectly everything God meant it to be. And when it clams, it feels gives pleasure, I'm sure. But are you being what you were meant to be, are you using your gifts and capacities in  that way for Him? Do you see that? Okay, secondly, here's the other problem.

Much more subtle and much more difficult than this we have to close is the other problem. Of work is the meaning of life, you see because you heard me, didn't you hear me? Okay, very close to saying that as you work, you find yourself, yeah. As you work onto the Lord, you find yourself. There's a place in the Narnia Chronicles where Lucy reads a beautiful story, the most beautiful  story she ever, ever, ever heard and as soon as she closed the page, she couldn't remember  it.

No matter how hard she tried but from that all the time on, for the rest of her life, whenever  she heard a good story, she always said, I know that's a good story because it reminds  me of the one that I can't quite remember. It gets me back to that story and when I get into heaven, I'll have the story for real. There's a sense in which when we're doing our jobs well, using the gifts, feeling  is pleasure, doing things with all his might, being useful to people, being a good steward  of what we've got, there's an almost a sense in which it gets us back in touch with that  story of who we're really supposed to be that we won't quite, we can't quite remember  where we won't really know until we get there. But on the other hand, work is definition, the perfect example of that was rocky, rocky,  sure. Go for it.

What's it? Not money. Oh no. What's it? If I just go the distance, then I'll know that I'm not a bum.

If I can do my job right, I know I have a self, I know I exist. The way you know that you've moved over from work as dignity to work as being your salvation  is you're working yourself into the ground. Now, they say, what about the fact that I'm scared of losing my job? People are giving me too much to do. You see, there's plenty of people to whom work is a curse, or to whom work is fulfillment  of their meaning in life and they're your boss.

When that happens, it's mighty difficult for you to just sort of arrange things the way  you want. But look carefully and look really at your motives. What this says is, you must never work for your boss. You must never work for your constituency. You must never work for the people out there.

How was it possible for a slave to get through a day? Paul says the only way a slave is going to get through the day is to look at the master  and of course in the heart not out loud say, I'm not working for you. That's how I deal with it. That's how she dealt with it. I'm not working for you.

I'm working for my master in heaven. I'm going to do the best job with my gifts today. I'm going to be as useful as I possibly can. I'm not going to worry about how you think or what you feel. I am simply going to do what you ask me to do, but I'm not working for you.

And until you're able to do that yourself, you're not going to be able to deal with the  pressure. Hey, you know, as Christian workers have the worst problem of all. Because of course you're working for the Lord, not necessarily at all. I have to every single week. I've got to look out there and say, I am not working for you.

You see because it is not very far to say, I really need for them to come back next week  and bring somebody. That's why I'm preaching. Oh no, oh no. I got as much of a problem with being a slave to you. As you've got a problem being a slave to your worker, these folks have being a slave  to their masters.

Now here's the last thing I'll say. You've got to be a Christian to do this. You've got to be a Christian to do this, because unless God is the meaning for your life and  unless he's the thing you're living for, you've only got leisure money or self-fulfillment  and self-actualization. You've got nothing else. And both of those things are going to destroy the country, which they are economically and  most of all, they'll destroy you, especially if you become that workaholic that I got  to live for my work.

There was a University of California Berkeley student, not too long ago, that went berserk  in class. Start running around, yelling, they're getting ahead of me. They're getting ahead of me. Sure, he looked down on the gym. There was people down there who were getting ahead of him in training.

There were people in the library reading books he should have been reading. They're getting ahead of him. The poor guy, down into the ground. Why? Because unless I do a great job, I won't know that I exist.

Everybody's getting ahead of me. What else are you going to live for unless you live for Jesus? You're going to have to live for money. And that's the most boring thing. I tell you this, I tell you, we're not built for that kind of work and it will kill you.

Your life will become like a dust storm that's choking you. But you're not built to live for work either. That'll just grind you into the ground. You'll never be able to relax. You'll never be able to say, I'm going home because I'm working for him.

I'm not working for you. I'm not working even for me. I'm working for him. You've got to, by the way, have a personal relationship with him because it says, don't  work for them. Don't look at their eyes.

Look at God's eyes. You've got to be a Christian. You've got to have looked them in the eye and you've got to keep looking him in the eye. When you take your eye off of him, one way the other work will be a curse. It'll be a milestone around your neck and down you'll go.

Jenny, he says, I know God made me for China but he also made me fast and when I run,  I feel his pleasure. If you felt the pleasure of working for him, let's pray. Now Father, we thank you that you have shown it so much here. Even though we only had a brief period of time to look at it, I pray now that you would  enable us to bring you into every part of our lives so that we can truly be filled with  the Spirit and we can truly honor you. Lord, where else will we go if we don't work for you, if we don't live for you, we'll  just be crushed and yet we know, Father, that you would not have shown us this unless you're  going to give us your Spirit and give us the power to practice it.

So we ask that you'd help us now and we ask that you would help us to practice it and  apply it to our lives in the individual ways that we need to by your Spirit's help and  your Son's name. Amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

Today, on Gospel and Life, Tim Keller shows us that the Bible has incredibly helpful  and practical wisdom we can apply to the work we do. Some you may find surprising, even life-changing. Ephesians 6. We're going to read verses 5 through 9. Something about the subject, please.

We had a long series on marriage, as you know, as we got to Ephesians 5. And last week in this week, I've just decided to move on through quickly two very important  subjects, not necessarily the most inspiring subjects, not the kind of sermons or preaching  that everybody comes out saying, wow, that was so inspiring. The one subject is the relationships of parents to children, that was last week. And today, the relationships within the workplace of master to servant, of employer, of manager  to worker. Now, we're going to look at that tonight, and this will be the only night we talk about  again, and I'll get back to it in a second.

Again, it's not the most inspiring subject, and yet, it is so important, because when you  stop and consider how much of your time, how much of your life is built around your work,  and when you consider that the average Christian, when they, he or she sits down to try to say,  what does it mean for me to live my life out as a Christian? If somebody gives you a book on discipleship, here's what it means to be a disciple of Jesus,  here's what it means to be a Christian and to walk as a Christian. You will find, if you look carefully, that basically, that's really telling you, most  almost all that material, and I had to know I've written some of it, so I'm part of it. Almost all that material tells you how to be a Christian in the evenings and on the weekends. And since so many of you work on Saturday and get home at 10 o'clock at night, there's  really not a lot of time in which you can be a Christian, because you see, nobody's  telling you how to be a Christian on the job and in your work.

So we have to look at it. I need to say, though, like I said, it's not so much inspiring material as it is important  material, it's material that takes all of your wisdom to apply. It's not going to be easy to apply, but you have to say, unless I get this, unless I get  the hang of this, there's large sections of my life in which I'm not really letting  Christ impact my behavior. Starting next week, we're going to start a series, we're going to get down to chapter  six, verse 10. And I'm just letting you know that we're going to start another series.

Basically, this is a series of series with a couple of connector things, like the one  this week we're doing, but when we get down to verse 10 where it says, finally, be strong  in the Lord and in his mighty power, put on the full armor of God so that you can take  your stand against the devil's schemes, for our struggle is not against flesh and blood  but against the rulers, against the authorities and against powers of this dark world and  against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms, therefore put on the full  armor of God. We're going to take a lot of time to look at that. I think that there is a tremendous amount of teaching in this passage, it's actually  verse 10 to 20 of chapter six. It's about spiritual warfare, it's about supernatural evil, it's about, it's actually in many  ways, about what it means to live the Christian life militarily. And it doesn't mean that Christian is somebody who likes war, doesn't mean that Christian  is somebody, a hawk in the Gulf War, what we're talking instead of is a Christian, is a person  who is absolutely realistic about the nature of life.

Christians do not look through their life at life through rose colored glasses because  the Bible is not a set of rose colored glasses. The Bible says the Christian can be known as much for the fight in his life as for the  peace in his life. In fact there is a certain sense in which the way the real difference in a Christian  and non-Christian is not that a Christian has got a life of peace and non-Christian life  of conflict, but rather that when you become a Christian, places you had conflict, you  develop peace and places you had peace, you develop conflict. What happens is the battle moves around and Christianity is by no means, like I said  sentimental, it says a Christian is somebody who knows that it's a very, very difficult,  dangerous world out there. You expect to be shot at all the time.

You're never running home saying, you know as Elizabeth Eliot once said, if you're in  the ring and you got the box or trunks on, don't come running back to the guy in the  corner saying, that man hit me. Because your coach will say, if you don't want to get hit, get out of the ring. Being a Christian means you're in the ring. You can't complain about the fact that you come home every day bloody. A Christian is somebody who instead of saying that man hit me, a Christian says, I've got  to get on, the armor, I've got to get prepared, I've got to see what it is.

So we're going to spend a pretty good amount of time talking about the fact that Christianity  is a fight. One great book on the Christian life by John White, it's an interversely pressed book. Many of you may know it's one of the best overall books to give somebody who wants to understand  what does it mean to live a Christian life. It's called the fight. He's realistic, okay?

Now, but today, tonight, I would just look at briefly, but at another area where there's  a lot of fighting going on, even if it's not outside, it's certainly inside. And I'd like to look at Ephesians 6, and I'm just going to read verses 5 to 9, and map  out this evening some of the most basic principles of what back, what God tells you, you must  do in approaching work in a Christian way, in approaching your job. Let me just read from verses 5 to 9, slaves, you say, oh, this is me, okay. Obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as  you would obey Christ. Obey them, not only to win their favor, but when their eyes on you, but like slaves of  Christ, doing the will of God from your heart, serve wholeheartedly as if you were serving  the Lord, not men, because you know that the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good  he does, whether he is slave or free.

And masters treat your slaves in the same way, do not threaten them since you know that  he who is both their master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with  him. This is God's word, all right? Some general principles, then some practical, general and background, and then practical. This passage raises a lot of thorny issues, and fortunately since we're not making the  Christian and work a series, I'll just pass lightly on all of them, but again they're  important. Is you must keep in mind that this is another indication that Christianity is a whole  life religion, that Christianity has to touch every part of your life, that you're not  a Christian unless every part of your life has been completely reoriented.

Actually, this is another way of saying that a Christian doesn't do anything like a  non-Christian. Oh, a Christian does plenty of things that non-Christians do, but no, a Christian doesn't  do anything in the same way. Otherwise, why would Paul work out in such detail in every area of life? If you've been coming in the evening through Ephesians, you'll see that in every single  area of life, Paul says, this is what it means to be filled with a spirit, in communication. This is what it means in your marriage, this is what it means in your family, this is  what it means in your relationship to your parents in your workplace, this is what it  means in your social relationships, this is what it means in your understanding of culture  and so on.

Why would Paul say that unless a Christian in every area is doing things differently? That means that Christianity is not a Sunday thing or an evening thing. It's an all day, it's a whole life thing. That's the reason when Paul says, be filled with a spirit, he works out in every single  area of life. Secondly, you really got to keep in mind that Paul is still telling people what it means  to be filled with a spirit.

Now the trouble with long-winded preachers like myself is that it's been weeks and weeks. I forget. I do, and I think when we looked at verse 17 of chapter 5 and 18 where it says don't  be drunk with wine but be filled with a spirit, and then he goes on and says, being filled  with a spirit means that you talk to one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs  and you make melody in your heart to the Lord and you thank God for everything. Hmm. How did I do that?

Hmm. Oh, there we go. Wow, I got to be careful about that. That was the mic. That was not me, honest.

I should not. I didn't have supper. So, shoo, boy. I'm not that long-winded here. So anyway, long-winded.

When you're long-winded you might sometimes a minister like myself can make you lose track. Of the fact that Paul is still talking about what it means to be filled with a spirit  because in verse 21 he said, submit to one another. Then he begins to move into all areas of life to show how spirit filled people relate  to the people around them. Now, this should at least tell you this, especially those of you who have come out of churches  that put lots of emphasis on being filled with a spirit. I think we got to last week in the morning services was this.

When the Bible talks about what it means to be filled with spirit, it always talks about  the heart. The heart is affected by the spirit. Now, something that probably needs to be brought out all the time is in the Bible. The word heart does not really have the same meaning that it tends to have in English. In English, the word heart means the emotions.

The heart is something that's opposed to the head. That's the reason why Maria can say, my head tells me one thing, but my heart needs  to, my heart tells me that this is what I want to do. You see the heart and the head are put against one another. In the Bible, the word heart is the seat of the whole soul. That means you can think with your heart and you can will with your heart and you  can feel with your heart and you'll see different places in the Bible where it talks about  as a man thinketh in his heart and so forth.

The heart is the seat of the mind, the will and the emotions and the way you know that  the spirit of God is really affecting you in the heart is that your religion is not  just emotional. We talked about this a couple of weeks ago in the morning service, not just emotional  and not just volitional and not just intellectual. There's a very, very important thing to consider. Some of you know, some of you have been converted since you started coming to this church  and yet you were very religious before. Now, you're an interesting kind of person and very often sitting down, you can look  back and say, you know, my parents aren't going to believe this.

A lot of people aren't going to believe this because I've been in church for years  and yet I was never a Christian until I came here. And very often if you sit down and talk and you think about it, you'll be able to identify  that you didn't understand the gospel, but there was some signs. You should have been aware of it because in some cases your religion was nothing but  intellectual. That means you thought about the Bible and you knew a lot and you argued about it and  you got your thinking straight. And yet there was never any emotional sense of the presence of God, there was never any  passion, there was never any warmth, that's the emotional side.

And volitionally, that means in behavior, there was never much in the way of change going  on in your life. You couldn't say, well, I'm more loving than I was last year, I'm more patient than  I was last year, I'm more wise than I was last year. Then other folks say my life was a volitional one. That means I was a very dutiful, disciplined person, but there was no growth in my thinking  and I never since I had a real relationship with God, you see. Now many people may find that though they love worship and though they seem to be having  tremendous emotional experiences and they say, therefore, I must be filled with a spirit.

Yet when it comes down to it, Paul is saying, if there isn't a progressive transformation  in all of your living areas and your life relationships, you're not filled with the spirit. Being filled with the spirit is not a matter of crying at worship services. It's not a matter of super high emotions though, of course it includes those things, yes  it does, but you know, to be filled with the spirit, you know it, you feel it. But you can be thinking you're filled with the spirit and have an emotional experience  unless it's working out in the way in which you relate to people on the job, in the way  in which you relate to your parents and in all of these areas, unless those things have changed,  you're not filled with the spirit. Now that's the most, in some ways, the most obvious point of this passage and you'd  miss it completely unless you stand back and say, what is Paul saying?

You look at the context which is hard to see again when you come to this church because  I go on so slowly through the passage. The main point is you're not filled with the spirit unless you find that the way in which  you relate to people on the job has really been changed. Okay, now one more background area, one more background thing, a general thing, but it's  not important, it's not practical, but it's a big issue, you can't really go buy it. In fact, if I don't go buy it, somebody's going to come up and ask me about it afterwards  anyway. Does this passage condone slavery?

Now you see, there's been two kinds of enemies of the gospel who have really misused this  passage. One kind, unfortunately, enemies of the gospel, where people who didn't think they were  enemies of the gospel, they were people in the church, they were clergy who have used  this passage to say, yes, slavery is fine. And if you want to go back in the 1850s and the 1860s, you will find United States clergy  men, especially in the south, justifying the institution of slavery on the basis of this  passage. They say, hey, you know what it says to slaves, doesn't say get going? It says, oh, buy your masters.

It says you should, you see, well, there we go. And on the other hand, there's other people who have misused this. There's people who said, see, the Bible does condone slavery. And that just shows that the Bible is, you know, a good book in many ways, but basically  about where looking book, a primitive book, you know, a book with retrograde morality. This is an unworthy text.

And so there's a lot of good things in the Bible, but basically there's things in the Bible  that really are not good. There's things that are backward looking, that are bad that we have to reject, that are  immoral even. It supports this, it supports racism, it supports classism, it supports slavery and so on. Well, neither those folks are right, especially I have to say the latter people, it's an illogical  thing to say, since the Bible condemns slavery. And since we know slavery is wrong, therefore the Bible is characterized by inferior morality  at this point.

You see, friends, the Bible claims to be revelation from God. And if God has spoken, and if God has revealed Himself and said, this is what's right and  this is what's wrong, then there really can be absolute principles of morality that we  can say to everybody, no matter what you think, this is right and this is wrong. This is a universal absolute truth, this is objective truth just like the law of gravity,  you've got to believe it. But if there's no revelation, if there's no place that God has spoken and told us what  is right and wrong, then all morality is a matter of opinion, all morality. And I like to know where you get this high standard of morality by which you can judge  the Scripture, where does it come from?

You see, if there's no revelation, then it's a matter of opinion, and you might be, you  might have your opinion, but there's no way you could consider this inferior. You see that? You know, basis for saying so. Now, the fact is, the reason I know, and the reason you should know the slavery is wrong,  is because we believe the Bible's revelation. First, there's two things you've got to say about this passage in slavery.

First of all, no, of course it doesn't say in this spot, slaves go get loose. You've got to remember, again, the context, the context is, what does it mean to be filled  with the Spirit, and how is that going to affect tomorrow, every one of your relationships? It's natural and normal, in a sense, that the Bible never deals with a social issue  abstractly. It always deals with it from the standpoint of how does this relate to your relationship  with God? Yeah, again, a couple of weeks ago, we've pointed this out.

The Bible, in a sense, will not, this is in the morning service, so I'll bring this  up here. I mention this. The Bible, in a sense, does not even, well, not even, the New Testament will not even  talk to you about most issues until you decide what you think about Jesus. There's a sense in which it won't even let you get to other issues. People will say, well, I'm interested in being a Christian, but I don't know what I believe  about evolution.

Or they say, I'm interested in Christianity and I might be interested in Christ, but  I don't understand what it means by turning the other cheek. Or I like a lot of things, but I'm afraid if I become a Christian, that this is going  to change my politics one way or the other, or even a person says, I like to come to Christianity,  but I first have to find out what I would have to do in this or that area of my life. And there's a sense in which the New Testament says, there's no way we're going to answer  those questions. There's no way the New Testament writers say we're going to answer those questions. First, what do you think of him?

Now, the reason they do that is because they say if Christianity was basically an intellectual  philosophy, then you could have your answers to your philosophical questions before you  come to him. But if Christianity is essentially a relationship, a personal relationship, then you have to figure  out what you think of him, whether what he says about himself is true or not, and whether  you're going to accept or reject him, otherwise, everything else the New Testament says makes  no sense. It's silly to say, I don't know if Jesus is God, but I want to know what the Bible says  what Christianity says about slavery. It's ridiculous to even ask a question like that. The point is, if Jesus isn't God, who cares what the Bible says about slavery?

If Jesus isn't God, who cares what anybody thinks? It's all a matter of opinion. On the other hand, if Jesus is God, then we can talk. Once you understand that, once you accept him, once you receive him into your life, then  all sorts of things that he says will start to make sense, but not until then. See that?

The great illustration is that marriage is a complex thing, as you know, so we spent  nine weeks on it. There's all sorts of facets to it. And there's a lot of things that you do in marriage, a lot of issues, a lot of business  you do, but every so often, one person or the other, right? We'll suddenly stop and say, we can't do anything else because there's something wrong  with our relationship. We can't make this decision.

We can't go on this trip. We can't buy this thing because our relationship is a mess. We can't go any further until we get that straight. Why? Because marriage, ultimately, and first of all, is a personal relationship, right?

And it's only secondarily a financial or a business or a travel partnership. In the same way, Christianity says, first, first, first, you relationship with God, that's  the first issue. And that's why you never see Christianity almost dealing with any issue of a social  issue abstractly. The first thing Paul's going to say to slaves is, well, let's debate whether or not it's  right or wrong for you to leave, whether we should start an abolitionist movement. That's not the first thing he says.

The first thing he says is, tomorrow, if you're filled with the spirit, how's that going  to affect the way in which you deal with your master? That's why he's doing it that way. He's not condoning slavery here. He's talking about how slaves are going to live their lives tomorrow. He's immediate.

He's practical. And he's dealing with things from a God-ward relationship point of view. You absolutely have to remember that. And that's really critical. And by the way, and we'll say one more thing in a minute about slavery and Christianity,  one other thing is whatever God says to these people about how to conduct their work  life, whatever he says to these people, if it works for them, it probably ought to work  for you.

You can laugh about being slaves, but you're not. You can laugh at saying, I'm miserable, but you weren't as miserable as these people  where I can tell you that. You can laugh about being poorly paid and never worked, but these people are more poorly  paid and more overworked. You can grump about lack of independence. These people had a little less than you do.

If it works for these folks, it should work for you, okay? It's estimated that most of us spend half of our waking hours at work. How does the wisdom of the Bible apply to our careers? In other words, how can our work connect with God's work? And how can our vocations be more emotional?

In his book, every good endeavor, Tim Keller draws from decades of teaching on vocation  and calling to show you how to find true joy in your work as you serve God and others. The book offers surprising insights into how a Christian perspective on work can serve  as the foundation for a thriving career and a balanced personal life.

That's gospelandlife.com-slash-give.

Now one more thing, and that is you can't find a verse actually that tells people that  there's nothing, you're not going to find a verse in the Bible that says we need to abandon  slavery. Not only that, you don't see a verse in the Bible that says whether or not you should  belong to a labor union, you're not going to find a verse that says a lot of things,  and here's the reason why, because what the Bible does is it lays down universal principles  that apply to everything. If it went after this or that social institution, it would end up with a detailed way. It's there'd be big sections of the Scripture that we could just say off, that doesn't apply  to us. Who got rid of slavery?

It was essentially, and I think most people would agree with this, most historians would  certainly agree with it. It was essentially Christians and evangelical Christians. There was a friend of mine who's now passed away, who was a history professor and a student  of history at Yale University, and he did his dissertation there on abolitionism in  the States. He says, you know, a historian doesn't think the way normal people do. He says a historian doesn't say, look at the abolition of slavery and say, why did people  put up with it that long?

How could those people have ever put up with slavery? It's amazing. It took so long for those people to abolish it. The historian asked the question, since everybody, everywhere, did it. As far back as human beings can ever remember, that the strong enslaved the weak, and the  conquerors enslaved the conquered, since everybody had done it from whenever.

Why did it ever get into anybody's mind that it was wrong? He started saying it's very difficult to understand. He says the point is that the people got the idea that it was wrong from the Bible. In Britain and here, in Britain, there was a man named William Wilberforce, who was a very  wealthy person, born in the lap of luxury, who lived in the early 19th century, and who  led a life-long battle to get it abolished in the British Empire. Why?

Because you see, William Wilberforce didn't necessarily find a verse about slavery one way  or the other instead. He found all the passage. He found the Ten Commandments. He found the golden rule. Love your neighbor as yourself.

Pay people wages. Treat every human being with dignity. And it's just very easy to see that every human being is an image of God. You don't have the right to own people, to sell people, to kill people, to say who's  going to marry who, and so forth, in that sense. And therefore, Christians understood that, and they got rid of it.

And that's the reason why you can say, you know, this passage can do in slavery, actually,  it doesn't abolish it. It doesn't condone. It's not talking about that. How do we know this slavery is wrong, though? Because we know, well, the Bible obviously is a backward-looking document.

If the Bible is a backward-looking document, if there is no revelation, you have no way  of judging what progress is, no way at all. It's a crap shoot. The deconstructionists know it. They're saying that. They're saying all beliefs are social constructions.

Basically, there's no right and wrong out. All beliefs come out of, you know, are socially constructed out of your own imagination  and basically out of communities. And if that's true, then which end is up? This end up, we don't know. There's no way of dealing with progress.

The reason I know this slavery is wrong is because the Scripture says so. Because Christianity lays out, you know, in a sense, Paul, even in this passage and other  places, if you look carefully, has sown the seed of his destruction. Now the practical, what we've got are several principles, actually two and only two. Let me tell them to you now and then go back and just elaborate on until we're finished. Let me tell them to you now.

There's two false views of work that this passage knocks down. First false view of work is that work is a curse and that leisure is the meaning of life. And here it tells us that you should be doing work as if it's the will of God and you should  be doing it from the heart. The second false view of work, so the first view is that work is a curse and leisure is  the meaning of life. The second false view of work is that work is the meaning of life.

And leisure is just something, you know, in other words, the first view says we work in order to really live. And the second view says we live in order to work. All I do, I just have enough leisure so I could just get back in there just enough so I don't completely kill myself. Leisure is my fulfillment, work is my fulfillment. Now I'm giving it to you in a nutshell, both of these things are very, very dangerous.

If work is a curse and leisure is the meaning of life, if that view of work gets into somebody or gets into a population,  gets into a society, what really happens, of course, is what is happening. One quarter of all human, well no, but actually I want to show you that in our culture,  both these false views of work are growing extremely fast because of the secularization of our society,  because God's out of the picture. If God's out of the picture, either leisure is the meaning of life or work is the meaning of life. Now if leisure is the meaning of life, and all I do, work is a curse and I don't really care whether I'm getting anything done,  whether I'm helping anybody, whether I enjoy what I'm doing, I just need to, I want to get enough dollars so I can really live. Do the things that I want.

In a situation like that, productivity goes down, pride in our work goes down, quality of product goes down. Do you know that today one quarter, studies show one quarter of all American workers are deeply ashamed of what they're producing in the workplace? That's deeply ashamed, okay? Three quarters of all people, three quarters of all people in the workplace say that the quality of the work at this place was better 10 years ago. That's pretty scary as well.

Well, what happens, of course, is to all society when that happens. And the third bad response or the third problem is dishonesty becomes routine when work is a curse. You don't have pride in your work, you don't see yourself as a servant of anybody, and therefore you're going to cut corners wherever you can. You're going to get whatever you can out of people. You're going to work strictly for the short term and getting the bucks, not for the long term, the good of the economy or the good of community or good of people.

Isn't that right? And so what you have is the great temptation of dishonesty over here on the left. That's an accident that I'm not talking about the left, but on my left hand, it could be on my right, I'm not talking about politics here. So on the one hand, work is a curse, however I must point out to some degree, it's a bit of a blue collar problem. But because on the other hand, we've got the other problem, that is where as people work in order to live, there's other people who live only to work.

Work as self fulfillment, work as the meaning of my life. Now the problem with this view and the problem that happens here is work, whereas it should be your dignity, it's become your definition. It's the thing that gives you even meaning in life. And of course, the great danger on this side is the danger of workaholism and burnout. And you see what's interesting is the temptation of dishonesty and the temptation to overwork are both stem from a lack of trust in God.

If you are dishonest to try to get more money, you're simply saying, I can't trust God to take care of me. On the other hand, if you are burning yourself out to work, in many cases again, you're saying, I can't really trust God to support and take care of me either. They both stem from a basically getting God out of the picture. Now let's talk about these two things briefly. And you see, on the one hand, the passage goes against the idea of work as a curse, it says, do your work as the will of God.

It gets rid of the view of work as self fulfillment, you see, because it's saying you're working for God. See, this person over here says, I'm working for the master. I'm just putting my time in. I'm working, you know, I've got the ball and chain on me, I'm just working for the money. Over here it says, I'm working for myself to fulfill myself, to know that I'm a great person, to know that I really can accomplish something.

And the Bible says, if you work for either for money or for yourself, the whole society will go down and you yourself will eventually break apart. So you have to transform, first of all, your view of work, it's not a curse, it's a calling. And then secondly, you have to transform the aim of your work. It's not a self fulfillment, but a service and stewardship of your gifts to please God. If you get those two things down, by and large, you're going to find an awful lot of your problems.

Not only in society, but in the workplace, we'll work themselves out. Now, I got a couple minutes, so let me go back and try to elaborate each of these a little bit. On the one hand, work as a curse. So that comes from the classical traditions, it comes from the Greeks and from the Romans. If anybody has read, if you read your Greek mythology close enough, you remember the little story of Pandora?

So this gave Pandora a box, when the world was perfect, there was no problems in the world. And so this gave Pandora a box and says, don't open that box, this is a real sexist myth anyway. We all know that because you know, you give it to a woman, so the woman is to blame. And at least in the in Genesis, the man and the woman do it together, and then they blame each other. Which we all know is absolutely realistic.

But in the Greek myth, it is a sexist myth. First of all, the woman is the one who's to blame and she's just too curious, she doesn't have self control. She lets her emotions get away with her. That's how the myth goes. The point I'm trying to make is, when she opens the box, all sorts of things come out.

The disease comes out, and death comes out, and hatred also, you know what else comes out? Work. Completely different approach to the Bible. The Bible tells us that work was there from the beginning, that Adminyve were put into the world to work,  and that you were built to work. You were built to get something, to take care of it, to cultivate it, to create.

You're made in the image of God who loves to create. You're made in the image of God who loves to take things and bring the best out of them. And if there was no sin in the world, you still have work. And in, as far as we know, in heaven, there's going to be work. Because you're built for it, and there can't be a real joy without it.

That's totally different than the Greek and Roman notion. See, the biblical understanding is that we were put here, and then sin happens through the man and the woman together. And all kinds of things come into the world, but work is not one of them. It was already there. It's not a curse.

It's cursed. Work has been cursed, but it's not a curse. Very important balance, but a very difficult one to maintain. Work is cursed. That's the reason why God says, to Adminyve, you're going to toil in the dust.

And you're going to try to cultivate the earth, and it'll never quite go right. And the thorns will come up. And that means no matter how good you are, and no matter how perfect your work environment is,  you're always going to find thorns coming up. Frustrations. Never able to quite do it.

But you cannot jump from that to saying, work is a curse. The Greek and the Roman idea. In fact, the Latin word for work, negotium, actually means non-leisure. It goes to show their idea was, work is a curse, and the best thing to do is get away from it, especially physical labor. Contrary to that, the Bible says, the first man was a gardener.

And the first man and woman were farmers. And they worked with their hands. Tremendous dignity given to work. Aristotle and Plato says, if you've got to work, you should never work with your hands. Do art.

And Vincent, what kind of art, right? Some of you get awfully dirty doing your art. I know that. Do music. Do philosophy.

Do politics. Anyway, the point is, you know, don't get dirty. Do politics. Oh, Aristotle, come on. The Bible says Adam and Eve worked in the garden.

But more than that, the Bible says that work is a calling. Now, what does that mean? It says so, it doesn't use that word here, though it's implied. It says so in first Corinthians, in several other places. Work is a calling.

A calling means that God has put things in you, given you abilities,  and that not that there's one job for you, but that there are a range of jobs that use those abilities  and you need to find your abilities so that you can use them as a signpost toward those  jobs that you will find that they will be fulfilling. There's a fulfillment there. Do you remember, for example, in Cherokee, it's a fire. Here you have two guys, Eric Little and Harold Abrams. And they're both working for the prize, and they're reaching for the prize, and they want  to be gold medalists in running.

They're doing the same thing, the same work and everything. Two quotes, Eric Little, at one point says to his sister, who's afraid he's not going  to go to missionary, to be a missionary in China, and eventually he did, of course, but he  says to her, Jenny, you've got to understand, I believe God made me for China, but he also  made me fast. And when I run, I feel his pleasure. See now there's a Christian view of work, too, both, remember I said there's a Christian  view of work, it's a calling, and the Christian aim of work, not for money and not for  yourself, but for him. What does he say?

First of all, there's the Christian view of work, God made me fast. And here's the Christian aim of work, when I run, I'm pleasing him, I feel his pleasure. Meanwhile, Harold Abrams says, I've never known contentment, I'm forever in pursuit, and  I don't even know what it is I'm chasing. Would you please answer me a very personal question? In your work right now, what is the language of your heart?

Do you say, man, when I do the thing I'm doing, I'm not doing it, but when I do the thing  I'm doing with all my might, I think I'm starting to find out who I really am. I'm finding myself. I feel his pleasure, or do you say, I'm working and working and working and working like  a dog? I don't even know what I'm working for, and there's no joy or contentment in it. Which are you closer to?

Now, I'll tell you this. If you're like Harold Abrams, then you have to look at these two things. One is you have to say, am I working only for money? Have I sold my soul for a massive potage? Is that what I've done?

More secondly, am I burning myself out and that gets us to the other thing? Because I'm trying to define myself in terms of my work, which is a more subtle problem  and a more difficult problem for Christians to deal with. If you say, hey, I don't think I'm doing that either, then thirdly, maybe you just  haven't really found the place that fits your gifts. You talk to people and find it. Well now, let me just talk briefly about that other side of things.

As I said, the work is a curse, leisure is the meaning of life. You've got to begin to realize you're not going to find yourself that way. You have to say, I am working as a steward of what God's given me, my gifts in the world. I am to be useful to people. That's what you work for, to be useful to people, to be a steward of the things that God's  given you, the world that He's given you, and the gifts that He's given you.

That's a calling. He's called you into that. And no matter who you are, no matter how high or how low, whether you're just a, quote,  a gardener or somebody sweeping, you see, as opposed to a philosopher, the biblical understanding  is whatever you do with all your might, you are pleasing Him and you are honoring Him. That's why Elizabeth Elliott, you've heard me say this, Elizabeth Elliott says, a clam  glorifies God better than you, she would say, why? Because a clam is doing exactly what it was built to do.

It is using its capacities, it's glorifying God by being a clam, it's glorifying God  by being a clam, it's perfectly everything God meant it to be. And when it clams, it feels gives pleasure, I'm sure. But are you being what you were meant to be, are you using your gifts and capacities in  that way for Him? Do you see that? Okay, secondly, here's the other problem.

Much more subtle and much more difficult than this we have to close is the other problem. Of work is the meaning of life, you see because you heard me, didn't you hear me? Okay, very close to saying that as you work, you find yourself, yeah. As you work onto the Lord, you find yourself. There's a place in the Narnia Chronicles where Lucy reads a beautiful story, the most beautiful  story she ever, ever, ever heard and as soon as she closed the page, she couldn't remember  it.

No matter how hard she tried but from that all the time on, for the rest of her life, whenever  she heard a good story, she always said, I know that's a good story because it reminds  me of the one that I can't quite remember. It gets me back to that story and when I get into heaven, I'll have the story for real. There's a sense in which when we're doing our jobs well, using the gifts, feeling  is pleasure, doing things with all his might, being useful to people, being a good steward  of what we've got, there's an almost a sense in which it gets us back in touch with that  story of who we're really supposed to be that we won't quite, we can't quite remember  where we won't really know until we get there. But on the other hand, work is definition, the perfect example of that was rocky, rocky,  sure. Go for it.

What's it? Not money. Oh no. What's it? If I just go the distance, then I'll know that I'm not a bum.

If I can do my job right, I know I have a self, I know I exist. The way you know that you've moved over from work as dignity to work as being your salvation  is you're working yourself into the ground. Now, they say, what about the fact that I'm scared of losing my job? People are giving me too much to do. You see, there's plenty of people to whom work is a curse, or to whom work is fulfillment  of their meaning in life and they're your boss.

When that happens, it's mighty difficult for you to just sort of arrange things the way  you want. But look carefully and look really at your motives. What this says is, you must never work for your boss. You must never work for your constituency. You must never work for the people out there.

How was it possible for a slave to get through a day? Paul says the only way a slave is going to get through the day is to look at the master  and of course in the heart not out loud say, I'm not working for you. That's how I deal with it. That's how she dealt with it. I'm not working for you.

I'm working for my master in heaven. I'm going to do the best job with my gifts today. I'm going to be as useful as I possibly can. I'm not going to worry about how you think or what you feel. I am simply going to do what you ask me to do, but I'm not working for you.

And until you're able to do that yourself, you're not going to be able to deal with the  pressure. Hey, you know, as Christian workers have the worst problem of all. Because of course you're working for the Lord, not necessarily at all. I have to every single week. I've got to look out there and say, I am not working for you.

You see because it is not very far to say, I really need for them to come back next week  and bring somebody. That's why I'm preaching. Oh no, oh no. I got as much of a problem with being a slave to you. As you've got a problem being a slave to your worker, these folks have being a slave  to their masters.

Now here's the last thing I'll say. You've got to be a Christian to do this. You've got to be a Christian to do this, because unless God is the meaning for your life and  unless he's the thing you're living for, you've only got leisure money or self-fulfillment  and self-actualization. You've got nothing else. And both of those things are going to destroy the country, which they are economically and  most of all, they'll destroy you, especially if you become that workaholic that I got  to live for my work.

There was a University of California Berkeley student, not too long ago, that went berserk  in class. Start running around, yelling, they're getting ahead of me. They're getting ahead of me. Sure, he looked down on the gym. There was people down there who were getting ahead of him in training.

There were people in the library reading books he should have been reading. They're getting ahead of him. The poor guy, down into the ground. Why? Because unless I do a great job, I won't know that I exist.

Everybody's getting ahead of me. What else are you going to live for unless you live for Jesus? You're going to have to live for money. And that's the most boring thing. I tell you this, I tell you, we're not built for that kind of work and it will kill you.

Your life will become like a dust storm that's choking you. But you're not built to live for work either. That'll just grind you into the ground. You'll never be able to relax. You'll never be able to say, I'm going home because I'm working for him.

I'm not working for you. I'm not working even for me. I'm working for him. You've got to, by the way, have a personal relationship with him because it says, don't  work for them. Don't look at their eyes.

Look at God's eyes. You've got to be a Christian. You've got to have looked them in the eye and you've got to keep looking him in the eye. When you take your eye off of him, one way the other work will be a curse. It'll be a milestone around your neck and down you'll go.

Jenny, he says, I know God made me for China but he also made me fast and when I run,  I feel his pleasure. If you felt the pleasure of working for him, let's pray. Now Father, we thank you that you have shown it so much here. Even though we only had a brief period of time to look at it, I pray now that you would  enable us to bring you into every part of our lives so that we can truly be filled with  the Spirit and we can truly honor you. Lord, where else will we go if we don't work for you, if we don't live for you, we'll  just be crushed and yet we know, Father, that you would not have shown us this unless you're  going to give us your Spirit and give us the power to practice it.

So we ask that you'd help us now and we ask that you would help us to practice it and  apply it to our lives in the individual ways that we need to by your Spirit's help and  your Son's name. Amen.

今天，在“福音与生命”（Gospel and Life）节目中，提摩太·凯勒向我们指出：圣经里有极其有益、非常实用的智慧，我们可以应用在自己所做的工作上。有些你可能会觉得出人意料，甚至会改变你的生命。以弗所书第6章。我们要读第5节到第9节。请先就这个主题说几句。

你们知道，我们在讲到以弗所书第5章时，做了一系列关于婚姻的信息。上周和这周，我决定继续往下讲，不过会很快带过两个非常重要的主题——不一定是最能激发热情的主题，也不是那种让每个人听完都说“哇，太受激励了”的讲道。一个主题是父母与儿女的关系，这是上周的内容。今天则是职场中的关系：主人与仆人，也就是雇主、管理者与工人的关系。今晚我们会来看这一段，而且这将是我们唯一一次讲这个主题；等会儿我会再回到这一点。

再说一次，这并不是最令人振奋的主题；然而它非常重要。因为当你停下来想一想：你有多少时间、你的人生有多少是围绕工作来展开的；再想一想：一般的基督徒在坐下来思考“作为基督徒，我该怎样把信仰活出来？”的时候——如果有人给你一本关于门徒训练的书，说“作耶稣的门徒是什么意思？”、“作基督徒、按着基督徒的方式行走是什么意思？”——你若仔细看，会发现基本上，那些内容几乎都在告诉你：怎样在晚上和周末作基督徒。既然你们当中这么多人星期六还要上班，晚上十点才到家，那么你能作基督徒的时间其实就不多了；因为你看，没有人在告诉你：怎样在工作岗位上、在你的工作中作基督徒。

所以我得说，就像我之前说的，这与其说是什么鼓舞人心的材料，不如说是很重要的材料——是那种需要你把所有智慧都用上才能应用出来的内容。应用起来不会容易，但你必须说：除非我明白这个，除非我掌握其中的要领，否则在我生命的许多领域里，我其实并没有让基督影响我的行为。从下周开始，我们要开始一个系列，我们会进入第六章第10节。我先告诉大家，我们将开始另一个系列。

基本上，这是一个由多个系列构成的系列，中间会有一些衔接性的内容，就像我们这周在做的这个；但当我们来到第10节——那里说：“最后，你们要靠着主，倚赖他的大能大力作刚强的人。要穿戴神所赐的全副军装，就能抵挡魔鬼的诡计。因我们并不是与属血气的争战，乃是与那些执政的、掌权的、管辖这幽暗世界的，以及天空属灵气的恶魔争战。所以，要拿起神所赐的全副军装……”——我们会花很多时间来查考。我认为这段经文里有极其丰富的教导；它实际上是第六章第10节到第20节。

这段讲的是属灵争战，讲的是超自然的邪恶；从很多方面来说，也是在讲如何以“军人的方式”来过基督徒的生活。这并不意味着基督徒是喜欢战争的人，也不意味着基督徒是在海湾战争中主张开战的“鹰派”。我们所说的乃是：基督徒是一个对生命的本质极其现实的人。

基督徒并不是戴着玫瑰色眼镜看人生，因为《圣经》本身就不是一副玫瑰色眼镜。《圣经》说，一个基督徒既可以因他生命中的争战而被人认识，也可以因他生命中的平安而被人认识。事实上，在某种意义上，基督徒与非基督徒真正的区别，并不是基督徒的生活只有平安、非基督徒的生活只有冲突；而是当你成为基督徒之后，你原来有冲突的地方会逐渐生出平安，而你原来觉得平安无事的地方反倒会开始出现冲突。发生的事情是：战场转移了。基督信仰绝不是——我刚才说过——那种感伤的东西；它说，基督徒是一个知道外面的世界非常、非常艰难、危险的人。你要预期自己时时刻刻都在被人射击。

你不会跑回家说——正如伊丽莎白·艾略特（Elizabeth Eliot）曾经说过的——如果你在拳击场里，已经穿上了拳击短裤，就别跑回角落里跟那个人说：“那个人打我。”因为你的教练会说：“如果你不想挨打，就别上擂台。”作基督徒就意味着你在擂台上。你不能抱怨自己每天回家都满身是血。基督徒不是说“那个人打我”，基督徒会说：“我得把盔甲穿上，我得做好准备，我得看清这到底是什么。”

所以我们会花相当多的时间来谈：基督信仰是一场争战。约翰·怀特（John White）写过一本关于基督徒生活的很棒的书，是 InterVarsity Press 出版的。你们中很多人可能知道，这本书是送给想要明白“活出基督徒生活意味着什么”的人最好的综合性书籍之一。书名叫《争战》（The Fight）。他很现实，好吗？

不过，今天、今晚，我想简要地再看另一个领域：那里有许多争战在发生，即便不在外面，也肯定在里面。我想看《以弗所书》第6章，我只读5到9节，并在今晚勾勒一些最基本的原则——关于神告诉你：若要以基督徒的方式来面对工作、面对你的职业，你必须做什么。

我先读5到9节：奴仆——你会说，哦，这就是我，好吧——“要惧怕战兢，用诚实的心听从你们肉身的主人，好像听从基督一般。不要只在眼前事奉，像是讨人喜欢的；要像基督的奴仆，从心里遵行神的旨意。甘心事奉，好像服事主，不像服事人；因为你们知道，各人所行的善事，不论是奴仆，是自由的，都必按所行的得主的赏赐。”

“你们作主人的，也要这样待奴仆；不要威吓他们，因为知道他们和你们同有一位主在天上，他并不偏待人。”这是神的话，好吗？

先讲一些一般性的原则，然后再讲一些实际的：先是总论与背景，然后是应用。

这段经文带出许多棘手的问题；幸好我们并不是在做一整个“基督徒与工作”的系列，我就不在每一点上都深谈，不过这些仍然很重要。

你必须记住，这又一次表明：基督信仰是一种“整全生命”的信仰；基督信仰必须触及你生命的每一个部分。除非你生命的每一部分都被彻底重新定向，否则你就不是一个基督徒。

其实，这也是在说：基督徒做任何事都不会像非基督徒那样做。哦，基督徒当然也做许多非基督徒会做的事，但不，基督徒做任何事都不会用同样的方式。否则，保罗为什么要在生活的每一个领域把这些讲得这么细呢？如果你一直在晚上来听《以弗所书》，你会看到，在生活的每一个领域，保罗都说：这就是被圣灵充满、彼此交通意味着什么。这在你的婚姻里意味着什么，这在你的家庭里意味着什么，这在你与父母的关系、在你的职场里意味着什么，这在你的社交关系里意味着什么，这在你对文化的理解里意味着什么，等等。

除非基督徒在每一个领域都在以不同的方式做事，否则保罗怎么会这么说？这就意味着，基督信仰不是只属于主日的事，或只属于晚上的事。它是一整天的事，是整个人生的事。这就是为什么当保罗说“要被圣灵充满”的时候，他会把它落实到生活的每一个领域。第二，你一定要记住：保罗仍然是在告诉人们，被圣灵充满意味着什么。

像我这样话多的讲道人带来的麻烦是：一周又一周过去了，已经好几个星期了。我会忘记。我真会忘记。我想我们看过第五章第17节和第18节——那里说“不要醉酒，酒能使人放荡；乃要被圣灵充满”——然后他接着说，被圣灵充满意味着：你们要用诗章、颂词、灵歌彼此对说，心被感动向主歌唱、赞美，并且凡事要奉我们主耶稣基督的名常常感谢父神。嗯，我刚才是怎么弄出那个声音的？

嗯。哦，来了。哇，我得小心点。那是麦克风，不是我，真的。

我不该那样。我还没吃晚饭。所以，哎呀。其实我没那么啰嗦。总之，话多。

当你讲话很冗长的时候——有时像我这样的传道人会让你跟丢思路——你可能会忘了：保罗仍然在讲“被圣灵充满”意味着什么。因为在第21节他说：“要彼此顺服。”接着他开始进入生活的各个领域，来说明被圣灵充满的人，如何与周围的人相处。至少，这应该让你明白一点——尤其是你们当中那些来自一些非常强调“被圣灵充满”的教会的人。我想我们上周早上的讲道刚好讲到这里。

圣经谈到“被圣灵充满”是什么意思时，总是在谈心。圣灵影响的是人的心。现在，有一件事大概需要不断被指出：在圣经里，“心”这个词的意思，并不真正等同于英语里通常的用法。在英语里，“心”往往指情感。

心被当作与头相对立的东西。这就是为什么玛丽亚会说：“我的头告诉我一件事，但我的心需要——我的心告诉我，我想这么做。”你看，心和头被放在彼此对立的位置。但在圣经里，“心”是整个人灵魂的所在。这意味着：你可以用心来思想，你可以用心来立志，你也可以用心来感受。你会在圣经不同的地方看到类似的说法，比如“人心里怎样思量”，等等。

心是思想、意志和情感的所在。你知道神的灵真的在你的心里动工的标志，就是：你的信仰不只是情绪化。我们在几周前早上的讲道里谈过：不只是情绪上的，也不只是意志上的，也不只是理智上的。有一件非常非常重要的事需要思考。有些人知道，你们当中有些自从开始来这间教会以后才信主归正，但在此之前你们其实很“宗教”。你们是很有意思的一类人，常常坐下来回想时会说：“你知道吗？我父母肯定不敢相信这事。”

很多人不会相信这一点，因为我在教会里待了好多年，可是直到我来到这里之前，我其实从来不是基督徒。很多时候，如果你坐下来谈一谈，认真想一想，你就会能够指出：你并不明白福音；其实是有一些迹象的，你本该察觉到。因为在某些情况下，你的宗教信仰不过是智性的。也就是说，你思考圣经，你知道很多，你为它争辩，你把自己的思想理顺了。然而你从来没有在情感上经历过上帝同在的真实感，从来没有热情，从来没有火热，从来没有温暖——这就是情感层面。

而在意志层面，也就是在行为上，你的生命里也从来没有发生多少改变。你无法说：嗯，我比去年更有爱心了，我比去年更有耐心了，我比去年更有智慧了。还有一些人会说，我的生活是在意志层面的。也就是说，我是一个非常尽责、很自律的人，但我的思想没有成长，而且我从来没有与上帝建立真实的关系，你明白吗？现在，许多人也许会发现：他们爱敬拜，他们似乎也有非常强烈的情感经历，于是他们说，因此我一定是被圣灵充满。

然而归根结底，保罗是在说：如果在你生活的各个领域、以及你生命中的各种关系上，没有持续推进的转变，你就不是被圣灵充满的。被圣灵充满，不在于你在敬拜聚会里流泪；也不在于情绪特别高涨——当然这些可以包含在内，是的，确实如此——但你知道，要被圣灵充满，你会知道，你会感觉得到。可是你也可能以为自己被圣灵充满，并且有情感体验；除非这会在你如何对待同事、如何对待父母、以及所有这些领域里体现出来，除非这些方面发生了改变，否则你就不是被圣灵充满的。现在，从某种意义上说，这就是这段经文最明显的一点；但如果你不退后一步问：保罗到底在说什么？你就会完全错过。

你再来这间教会时，会发现很难把握上下文，因为我讲这段经文讲得太慢了。重点是：除非你发现自己在工作中与人相处的方式确实被改变了，否则你就不是被圣灵充满。好，现在再补充一个背景点，再补充一件一般性的事；它不算重要，也不算实用，但却是个大问题，你不能真的绕过去。事实上，如果我不提，反正也会有人事后走过来问我：这段经文是在认可奴隶制吗？

你看，确实有两类福音的敌人严重滥用了这段经文。一类——很不幸——是福音的敌人；有些人并不认为自己是福音的敌人，他们是教会里的人，是神职人员，却用这段经文来宣称：是的，奴隶制没问题。你如果回到1850年代、1860年代，就会看到美国的牧师们，尤其是南方的，借着这段经文为奴隶制度辩护。他们说：嘿，你看这里对奴隶说什么？它并没有说“你们要走开/逃离”。它说的是：哦，要顺服你们的主人。

它说你应该——你看——好吧，就是这样。另一方面，也有人以另一种方式滥用这段经文。他们说：你看，圣经确实认可奴隶制。这就说明圣经在很多方面是一本好书，但基本上是一部落后的书，是一本原始的书，是一本道德观倒退的书。这是一段不配被尊重的文本。

所以，他们说圣经里有很多美好的东西，但基本上圣经里也有些东西真的不好；有些东西是落后的，是坏的，我们必须拒绝，甚至是不道德的。它支持这个，它支持种族主义，它支持阶级主义，它支持奴隶制，等等。

但这两类人都错了。尤其是后面那类人的说法——我必须这么讲——在逻辑上站不住脚，因为圣经是谴责奴隶制的。既然我们知道奴隶制是错的，就因此断言圣经在这一点上体现了低劣的道德，这种推论是不成立的。

你看，朋友们，圣经宣称自己是上帝的启示。若上帝已经发言，若上帝已经启示祂自己并说：这是对的，这是错的，那么道德就确实可以有绝对的原则；我们可以对所有人说，不管你怎么想，这是对的，这是错的。这是普世的绝对真理，这是客观真理，就像万有引力定律一样——你必须承认它。但如果没有启示，如果没有任何地方是上帝说过话、告诉我们什么是对、什么是错的，那么一切道德就都成了意见问题，一切道德都是如此。而我想知道，你用来评判圣经的这套高标准道德从哪里来？它从何而来？

你看，如果没有启示，那就只是意见问题；你可能——你可能有你的意见，但你没有任何方式可以把这个看成更低等。你明白吗？你没有说它低等的根据。现在，事实是：我之所以知道、而你也应该知道奴隶制度是错的，是因为我们相信圣经的启示。首先，关于这段谈到奴隶的经文，你必须说两件事。

第一，当然不是说在这里就写着：奴隶们去争取解放吧。你必须再一次记得它的处境、它的上下文：什么叫被圣灵充满？这会怎样影响明天、影响你每一种关系？从某种意义上说，圣经从来不会抽象地处理一个社会议题，这是很自然也很正常的。它总是从这样的角度处理：这与你和上帝的关系有什么关联？是的，就像我们几周前指出过的那样。

从某种意义上说，圣经不会——这是早堂崇拜，所以我也在这里提一下。我提过这个。圣经从某种意义上说，甚至不会——嗯，也不是“甚至不会”——新约甚至不会跟你谈大多数议题，直到你先决定你对耶稣怎么看。有一种意义上，它甚至不让你先去处理别的议题。人们会说：嗯，我有兴趣成为基督徒，但我不知道我对进化论该怎么相信。

或者有人说，我对基督教有兴趣，也可能对基督有兴趣，但我不明白“打你的右脸，连左脸也转过来由他打”是什么意思。或者我喜欢其中很多东西，但我担心如果我成了基督徒，这会把我的政治立场往某个方向改变，甚至有人说，我愿意来信基督教，但我得先弄清楚在我生命的这个或那个领域里，我到底得做些什么。可是在某种意义上，新约说，我们没法回答这些问题。新约作者说，我们没法先回答这些问题。首先，你怎么看他？

他们之所以这样做，是因为他们说：如果基督教基本上是一套理智上的哲学，那么你可以在来到他面前之前，就先得到你那些哲学问题的答案。但如果基督教本质上是一种关系，一种个人的关系，那么你就必须先弄清楚你怎么看他——他对自己的宣称是真是假——以及你要接受他还是拒绝他；否则，新约其余的一切话都毫无意义。说“我不知道耶稣是不是神，但我想知道圣经、基督教对奴隶制度怎么说”，这根本就是可笑的。关键在于：如果耶稣不是神，谁在乎圣经对奴隶制度怎么说？

如果耶稣不是神，谁在乎任何人怎么想？一切都不过是意见而已。另一方面，如果耶稣是神，那我们就可以谈了。你一旦明白这一点，一旦接纳他，一旦把他领进你的生命，那么他所说的各样事情就会开始变得有意义——但在那之前不会。明白吗？

最好的例子就是婚姻，你知道，婚姻是很复杂的，所以我们为此花了九个星期。它有各个不同的面向。婚姻里有很多事情要做，有很多议题、很多事务要处理；但每隔一段时间，总会有一方或另一方，对吧？会突然停下来，说：我们不能再做别的了，因为我们的关系出了问题。我们没法做这个决定。

我们不能去这趟旅行。我们不能买这个东西，因为我们的关系一团糟。在把这个理顺之前，我们不能再往前走。为什么？因为婚姻归根到底，首先是一种人际关系，对吧？

而它只是在其次才是财务上的、商业上的，或者旅行上的伙伴关系。同样地，基督教说，第一、第一、第一，你与上帝的关系，那才是首要的问题。这就是为什么你几乎从来不会看到基督教把任何社会议题抽象地拿出来处理。保罗要对奴隶说的第一件事，并不是：好吧，让我们来辩论你离开是否对或错，我们是不是应该发起一场废奴运动。这不是他首先说的。

他首先说的是：如果明天你被圣灵充满，这会怎样影响你对待你主人的方式？这就是他为什么这样处理。他在这里并不是在认可奴隶制。他是在谈奴隶明天要怎样过他们的生活。他是立刻的。

他很务实。他是从一个面向上帝、以与神关系为出发点的角度来处理事情。你绝对必须记住这一点。这真的很关键。顺便说一句，关于奴隶制与基督教，我们马上还会再说一句；另外一点是：无论上帝对这些人说了什么，告诉他们该如何经营自己的工作生活——无论他说了什么——如果对他们都行得通，那么对你大概也应该行得通。

你可以笑说他们是奴隶，但你不是。你可以笑说“我很痛苦”，但我敢说你没有这些人那么痛苦。你可以笑说自己薪水低、工作多，但这些人薪水更低、被压榨得更厉害。你可以抱怨缺乏独立性；这些人拥有的独立性比你还要少。

如果对这些人都行得通，那对你也应该行得通，好吗？据估计，我们大多数人把清醒时间的一半都花在工作上。圣经的智慧如何应用在我们的职业上？换句话说，我们的工作如何与上帝的工作相连？我们的职业呼召又如何能更有意义？

在他的著作《每一份美善的努力》（Every Good Endeavor）中，提摩太·凯勒（Tim Keller）汇集了数十年来关于职业与呼召的教导，向你展示当你服事上帝和他人时，如何在工作中找到真正的喜乐。本书对“以基督徒的视角看工作如何成为兴盛事业与平衡个人生活的根基”提供了出人意料的洞见。《每一份美善的努力》是我们为感谢你奉献、帮助“福音与生命”（Gospel and Life）把基督的爱分享给世界各地更多人而送上的回馈。请访问 gospelandlife.com-slash-give。也就是 gospelandlife.com-slash-give。

现在还有一件事：你其实找不到一节经文明确告诉人们“没有什么——你不会在圣经里找到一节经文说我们需要废除奴隶制度”。不仅如此，你也不会在圣经里找到一节经文告诉你该不该加入工会；你找不到圣经对很多事情都直接给出一节经文。原因在这里：圣经所做的是立下适用于万事的普遍原则。如果它针对某个或某些社会制度逐条开战，最后就会变成一套非常细致的条款。那样一来，圣经里就会有大段内容我们可以直接说：“哦，那不适用于我们。”那么，是谁废除了奴隶制度？

基本上——我想大多数人都会同意，多数历史学家更会同意——是基督徒，尤其是福音派的基督徒。有一位朋友现在已经去世了，他曾是历史教授，也是耶鲁大学的历史研究者；他在那里的博士论文就是研究美国的废奴运动。他说，你知道，历史学家的思考方式跟普通人不一样。他说历史学家不会看着废奴这件事就问：“人们为什么会容忍它那么久？”

“那些人怎么可能容忍奴隶制度呢？真不可思议。他们用了这么久才把它废除。”历史学家反而会问这样的问题：既然人人、处处都这么做。只要追溯到人类能够记得的最早年代，强者就奴役弱者，征服者就奴役被征服者；既然从一开始大家就都是这么做的——从古至今。

为什么竟然会有人认为那是错的？他开始说，这很难理解。他说，关键在于，人们之所以觉得那是错的，是从圣经里得来的。在英国以及这里——在英国，有一个人叫威廉·威伯福斯（William Wilberforce），他非常富有，生来锦衣玉食，生活在19世纪初，并且一生为在大英帝国废除奴隶制度而战。为什么？

因为你看，威廉·威伯福斯不一定是在圣经里找到一节经文，直接讲奴隶制度到底对还是不对；相反，他看见了所有相关的经文。他看见了十诫。他看见了黄金法则：“爱人如己”。

给人应得的工价。以尊严对待每一个人。并且很容易看出，每一个人都是神的形象。你没有权利拥有别人、买卖别人、杀害别人，决定谁要和谁结婚，等等——从这个意义上说。于是，基督徒明白了这一点，就把它废除了。

所以你可以说，你知道，这段经文其实也能被用来对付奴隶制度——它并没有废除奴隶制度；它也没有认可奴隶制度。它并不是在谈这个。那么我们怎么知道奴隶制度是错的呢？因为我们知道——嗯，圣经显然不是一份向后看的文件。

如果圣经是一份向后看的文件，如果没有启示，你就没有任何办法判断什么是“进步”，一点办法都没有。这就像掷骰子。解构主义者知道这一点，他们也在这样说。他们说，一切信念都是社会建构。

基本上，外在并没有对错。一切信念都出自——你知道——都是从你自己的想象里、基本上也从群体里社会建构出来的。若真是这样，那么哪头朝上？我们不知道。就没有办法处理“进步”这个概念。

我之所以知道这种奴役是错误的，是因为圣经这么说。因为基督教在某种意义上提出了这样一套思路：保罗，即便在这段经文以及其他地方，如果你仔细看，他其实已经撒下了导致它自我毁灭的种子。现在在实际层面上，我们有几个原则，其实只有两个，而且仅此两个。我先把它们告诉你们，然后再回过头来逐一展开，直到我们讲完。我先把它们告诉你们。

这段经文击破了两种关于工作的错误看法。第一种错误看法是：工作是咒诅，休闲才是人生的意义。而这里告诉我们，你应当把工作当作神的旨意来做，并且要从心里去做。第二种关于工作的错误看法是：工作就是人生的意义。

而休闲不过是某种……换句话说，第一种观点说：我们工作是为了真正去生活。第二种观点说：我们活着是为了工作。我所做的一切，就是只保留一点休闲，好让我能再回到工作里去，刚好够用，不至于把自己彻底累死。休闲是我的满足，工作是我的满足。现在我用最简短的方式告诉你们，这两种东西都非常、非常危险。

如果把“工作是咒诅、休闲是人生意义”这种工作观灌输到某个人身上，或渗入到一个群体、一个社会里，真正发生的当然就是我们正在看到的那些事。四分之一的所有人类，嗯，不——其实我想向你们说明的是：在我们的文化里，这两种关于工作的错误看法都在以极快的速度增长，这是因为我们社会的世俗化，因为神被排除在视野之外。若神不在画面中，那么要么休闲是人生的意义，要么工作是人生的意义。现在，如果休闲是人生的意义，而我所做的一切——工作是咒诅，我并不在乎我是否完成了什么，是否在帮助任何人，是否享受我在做的事；我只是需要——我想赚到足够多的钱，好让我真正去生活，去做我想做的事。

在那样的情况下，生产力下降，对工作的自豪感下降，产品质量也下降。你知道吗？研究显示，如今有四分之一——四分之一的美国职场员工，对自己在工作中产出的东西深感羞愧。是深感羞愧，好吗？职场上有四分之三的人——四分之三的人——说这个地方的工作质量在十年前更好。这也相当可怕。

当然，当这种情况发生时，会对整个社会造成什么影响。第三种糟糕的反应，或者第三个问题是：当工作成了咒诅，不诚实就会变得司空见惯。你对自己的工作没有自豪感，你也不把自己看作在服事任何人，因此你会尽可能地偷工减料。你会尽可能从别人身上榨取你能得到的。你会只为短期、为赚钱而工作，而不是为了长期——为了经济的益处、社区的益处或人的益处。

不是这样吗？所以你看到的，是这边左边对不诚实的巨大诱惑。那只是一个巧合，我说的不是“左派”，而是我左手这边；也可以在我右边——我不是在谈政治。所以一方面，工作成了咒诅，不过我必须指出，在某种程度上，这更像是一个蓝领的问题。但另一方面，我们还有另一个问题：有些人工作是为了生活，而另一些人却只为工作而活。

把工作当作自我实现，把工作当作我生命的意义。这个观点的问题、以及这里发生的问题是：工作本该是你的尊严，却变成了你的定义。它成了甚至赋予你生命意义的东西。当然，这一边最大的危险就是工作狂和精疲力竭的危险。有意思的是，不诚实的诱惑和过度工作的诱惑，两者都源于对上帝缺乏信靠。

如果你为了赚更多钱而不诚实，你其实是在说：我不能信靠上帝会照顾我。另一方面，如果你把自己累垮、拼命工作，在很多情况下你同样是在说：我也不能真正信靠上帝会供应并照顾我。这两者都源于一个基本点：把上帝从画面中排除出去。现在我们简要谈谈这两件事。你看，一方面，这段经文反对“工作是咒诅”的观念，它说：要把你的工作当作上帝的旨意来做。

它也消除了把工作当作“自我实现”的看法，因为它是在说：你是在为上帝工作。你看，这边这个人说：我是在为主人工作。我只是来打卡熬时间。我工作，你知道，我像被铁球铁链拴着一样，我只是为了钱而工作。那边则说：我是在为自己工作，为了实现自我，为了知道我是个了不起的人，为了知道我确实能成就点什么。

而圣经说：如果你工作是为了钱，或是为了自己，整个社会都会走向衰败，而你自己最终也会崩溃。所以首先你必须改变你对工作的看法：工作不是咒诅，而是呼召。其次，你还必须改变你工作的目标：不是自我实现，而是把你的恩赐当作服事与管家的托付，用来讨上帝喜悦。如果你把这两点抓住了，基本上你会发现你许多的问题——

不仅在社会里，也在职场中——都会得到解决。现在我还有几分钟，所以让我回过头来，把这两点各自再稍微展开一点。首先，工作是咒诅的观念。这来自古典传统，来自希腊人和罗马人。如果有人读过——如果你把希腊神话读得够仔细——你会记得潘多拉那个小故事吗？

所以这就给了潘多拉一个盒子；当世界完美的时候，世上没有任何问题。于是就给了潘多拉一个盒子，说：“不要打开那个盒子。”反正这确实是个很性别歧视的神话。我们都知道，因为你看，把它给了一个女人，所以女人就该背锅。至少在《创世记》里，男人和女人是一起做的，然后他们彼此推诿。我们都知道这完全符合现实。

但在希腊神话里，这是个性别歧视的神话。首先，要怪的是女人，而且她就是太好奇了，没有自制力；她让情绪牵着走。神话就是这么讲的。我要说的是，当她打开盒子，各种各样的东西都跑出来。

疾病出来了，死亡出来了，仇恨也出来了，你知道还有什么出来了吗？工作。与圣经完全不同的路数。圣经告诉我们，工作从一开始就在那里；亚当和夏娃被放在世界里是要工作的；而你被造就是为了工作。你被造是要得到一些东西、照看它、耕作它、创造。

你是按那位喜爱创造的上帝的形象被造的。你是按那位喜欢把事物拿来、把其中最好的带出来的上帝的形象被造的。如果世界里没有罪，你仍然会有工作。而且据我们所知，在天堂里也会有工作。因为你就是为此而被造的；没有它就不可能有真正的喜乐。

这与希腊和罗马的观念完全不同。你看，圣经的理解是：我们被放在这里，然后罪通过男人和女人一起发生了。各种各样的东西进入了世界，但工作不是其中之一。工作早就在那里了。它不是咒诅。

它被咒诅了，但它本身不是咒诅。这是非常重要的平衡，却也非常难以维持。工作被咒诅了。这就是为什么上帝对亚当和夏娃说，你们要在尘土中劳苦。

而你将要尝试耕种大地，却永远不会完全顺利。荆棘会长出来。这意味着不管你有多优秀，也不管你的工作环境有多完美，你总会发现荆棘不断冒出来——挫折，永远没法把它做到尽善尽美。

但你不能因此就跳到一个结论：工作本身是咒诅——那是希腊和罗马人的观念。事实上，拉丁语里“工作”这个词 negotium，字面意思其实是“非休闲”。这恰恰说明他们的想法是：工作是咒诅，最好的做法就是逃离工作，尤其是体力劳动。与此相反，《圣经》说，第一个人是个园丁。

第一个男人和女人是农夫，他们用自己的双手劳动。工作被赋予了极大的尊严。亚里士多德和柏拉图说，如果你不得不工作，就绝不要用手去做；去做艺术。

而且，Vincent，做什么样的艺术，对吧？你们当中有些人做艺术时会把自己弄得很脏，我知道。做音乐。做哲学。

做政治。总之，重点是，你知道的，别把自己弄脏。做政治。哦，亚里士多德，算了吧。《圣经》说亚当和夏娃在园子里工作。

不仅如此，《圣经》还说工作是一种呼召。那是什么意思？它确实这么说，只是这里没有用那个词，但意思在其中。在《哥林多前书》以及其他好几处经文里都说：工作是呼召。

所谓呼召，意思是神把一些东西放在你里面，赐给你能力；并不是说只有一份工作是为你预备的，而是有一系列工作可以运用这些能力。你需要认识自己的能力，把它们当作路标，指向那些能使用这些能力、并且你会发现有满足感的工作——那里有一种成全与满足。你还记得吗，比如说，在 Cherokee 里，它是一团火。这里有两个人，Eric Little 和 Harold Abrams。他们都在为奖赏而努力，都在伸手去抓住那奖赏，都想成为跑步项目的金牌得主。

他们做的是同一件事，同样的工作，一切都一样。

两段引言。埃里克·利特尔（Eric Little）有一次对他的妹妹说——妹妹担心他不会去中国做宣教士；当然，他后来确实去了——他对她说：“珍妮，你得明白，我相信上帝造我，是为了去中国，但他也造我跑得快。而当我奔跑时，我感到他的喜悦。”

你看，这里也有一个基督徒的工作观。记得我说过：有一个基督徒对工作的看法——工作是一种呼召；也有一个基督徒在工作中的目标——不是为了钱，也不是为了自己，而是为了他。那他怎么说呢？

首先，这是基督徒对工作的看法：上帝造我跑得快。其次，这是基督徒对工作的目标：当我奔跑时，我是在讨他喜悦，我感到他的喜悦。

与此同时，哈罗德·艾布拉姆斯（Harold Abrams）说：“我从未体验过满足；我永远在追逐，可我甚至不知道我在追什么。”

请你回答我一个非常个人的问题：你现在工作的状态里，你心里在用什么样的语言说话？

你会说：“伙计，当我做我正在做的这件事时——不只是做，而是尽全力去做——我觉得我开始发现我真正是谁了。我在找到自己。我感到他的喜悦。”还是你会说：“我工作、工作、工作、工作，像条狗一样。我甚至不知道我为什么而工作，其中没有喜乐，也没有满足。”你更接近哪一种？

现在，我告诉你：如果你像哈罗德·艾布拉姆斯那样，那么你得看看这两件事。

第一，你得问：我是不是只是为了钱而工作？我是不是为了一大碗汤把灵魂卖了？我做的是不是这个？

第二，我是不是把自己烧干了？这就把我们带到另一个问题上。因为我试图用工作来定义自己——这更微妙，也更难让基督徒面对。

如果你说：“嘿，我觉得我两样都不是。”那么第三，也许你只是还没有真正找到那个与你的恩赐相匹配的位置。你去和人谈，去找到它。

好吧，现在让我简要谈谈事情的另一面。

正如我说过的，工作是咒诅，休闲才是人生的意义。你得开始意识到，你不可能用那种方式找到真正的自己。你必须说：我是在做管家的工作，管理神赐给我的东西——我在这个世界上的恩赐。我应当对人有益。你工作的目的就是对人有益；就是作神所赐之物的管家——祂赐给你的世界，以及祂赐给你的恩赐。

这是一种呼召。祂呼召你进入其中。无论你是谁，无论地位高低，无论你只是（所谓的）一个园丁，或是扫地的人——相对于一个哲学家——圣经的理解是：无论你做什么，只要尽你全力去做，你就在讨祂喜悦，你就在尊荣祂。这就是为什么伊丽莎白·艾略特——你们听我说过——伊丽莎白·艾略特说：一只蛤蜊比你更能荣耀神。她会说，为什么？因为蛤蜊正在做它被造出来要做的事。

它在运用自己的能力；它藉着成为一只蛤蜊来荣耀神，它藉着成为一只蛤蜊来荣耀神；它完全成了神原本要它成为的样子。而当它在“做蛤蜊该做的事”时，我敢肯定它也会感到喜乐、得到满足。但你呢？你是否正在成为你本应成为的样子？你是否在那样为着祂使用你的恩赐和能力？你明白吗？好，第二点，还有另一个问题。

比这更微妙、也更困难的——我们最后要收尾的——是另一个问题：工作就是人生的意义。你看，因为你们听见我刚才说的了，对吧？你们没听见吗？好，我几乎就要这么说了：当你工作时，你就找到自己——是的——当你为主而做工时，你就找到自己。《纳尼亚传奇》里有一处写到：露西读到一个美丽的故事，是她一生中听过、听过、再听过的最美的故事；可她一合上书页，就怎么也想不起来了。

无论她怎么努力，但从那以后，在她余生的所有时间里，每当她听到一个好故事，她总会说：我知道那是个好故事，因为它让我想起一个我怎么也想不起来的故事。它把我带回到那个故事；等我进了天堂，我就会真正拥有那个故事。某种意义上，当我们把工作做好，运用恩赐，心里有喜乐，用尽全力去做，对人有用，善用我们所拥有的一切作好管家时，几乎会有一种感觉：这让我们重新触摸到那个关于我们本该是谁的故事——我们记得不清、想不完整；直到我们到了那里，才会真正明白。但另一方面，工作也——最典型的例子就是《洛奇》，《洛奇》，对吧。来吧。

是什么？不是钱。哦，不。是什么？如果我只是坚持到最后一回合，那么我就知道我不是个废物。

如果我能把工作做好，我就知道我有一个自我，我就知道我真实存在。你从“工作带来尊严”滑向“工作成了你的救赎”的标志，就是你把自己工作到筋疲力尽。现在，他们会说：那我害怕丢工作怎么办？别人给我太多事做怎么办？你看，有很多人对工作而言它是咒诅，或者对他们来说工作就是他们人生意义的实现——而他们恰恰是你的老板。

当这种情况发生时，你就很难只是按你想要的方式把事情安排好。但要仔细看，真正看清你的动机。这里说的是：你绝不能为你的老板而工作。你绝不能为你的选民群体而工作。你绝不能为外面那些人而工作。

一个奴隶怎么可能熬过一天？保罗说，奴隶能熬过一天的唯一方式，就是看着主人——当然是在心里，不是大声说——说：我不是为你工作。这就是我处理的方法。这就是她处理的方法：我不是为你工作。

我是在为我在天上的主人工作。今天我要用我的恩赐把工作做到最好。我要尽可能地有用。我不会去担心你怎么想、你有什么感受。我只是要做你让我做的事，但我不是在为你工作。

在你自己也能这样做之前，你就无法应对那种压力。嘿，你知道，基督徒工作者的问题最严重。因为当然你是在为主工作，其实未必。我每个星期都得这样提醒自己。我必须看着你们说：我不是在为你们工作。

你看，因为只要稍微一转，就会变成：我真的需要他们下周再来，还要带一个人来。这就是我讲道的原因。哦不，哦不。我也同样会变成你们的奴隶；就像你们会变成你们老板的奴隶一样；这些人也会变成他们主人的奴隶。

现在我最后要说的是：你必须是基督徒才能做到这一点。你必须是基督徒才能做到，因为除非神是你生命的意义，除非祂是你所为而活的那一位，否则你就只剩下休闲、金钱或自我满足与自我实现。你没有别的。而这两样都会毁掉这个国家——经济上他们已经在这么做了——最重要的是，它们会毁掉你，尤其当你变成那种工作狂：我必须为我的工作而活。

不久前，加州大学伯克利分校有个学生在课堂上突然失控。开始在教室里跑来跑去，喊着：“他们在超过我。他们在超过我。”当然，他往健身房那边看，那里有人在训练，在超过他。

图书馆里有人在读他本该读的书。“他们在超过我。”可怜的人，被压得抬不起头。为什么？因为除非我把工作做得很出色，否则我就不知道自己是否存在。

大家都在超过我。若不是为耶稣而活，你还能为什么而活？你就不得不为钱而活。而那是最无聊的事情。我告诉你，我告诉你，我们不是为那种工作而被造的，它会要了你的命。

你的生命会变得像一场呛得你喘不过气的沙尘暴。但你也不是被造来为工作而活的。那样只会把你碾到地里。你永远无法放松。你永远无法说：我可以回家了，因为我是在为祂工作。

我不是为你工作。我甚至也不是为我自己工作。我是在为祂工作。顺便说一句，你必须与祂有个人的关系，因为这里说：不要为他们工作。不要盯着他们的眼色。

要看上帝的眼。你必须是基督徒。你必须曾直视祂的眼，并且要持续地直视祂的眼。当你把目光从祂身上移开时，无论哪一种方式，工作都会成为咒诅。它会像一块里程碑一样挂在你的脖子上，然后你就会沉下去。

Jenny，他说：“我知道上帝造我是为了中国，但祂也造我跑得快；当我奔跑时，我感到祂的喜悦。”如果你也能体会到为祂工作所带来的喜悦，让我们祷告。父啊，我们感谢你，你在这里如此清楚地向我们显明。尽管我们只有很短的时间来查看这些，我现在祈求你，使我们能把你带进我们生命的每一个部分，好叫我们真能被圣灵充满，真能尊荣你。主啊，若我们不为你工作、不为你而活，我们还能往哪里去呢？我们只会被压垮；然而我们也知道，父啊，你若不是要赐下你的圣灵、赐下实行这一切的能力，你就不会把这些向我们显明。

因此我们求你现在帮助我们，也求你帮助我们去实行它，并在我们各自需要的具体方面，把它应用在我们的生活里——借着圣灵的帮助，奉你儿子的名。阿们。
