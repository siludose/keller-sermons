### Introduction: The Importance of Work

If you have a job, it's likely that you think about it a lot. But how much of you thought about the Biblical approach to your work? Today, on Gospel and Life, Tim Keller shows us that the Bible has incredibly helpful and practical wisdom we can apply to the work we do. Some you may find surprising, even life-changing. Ephesians 6. We're going to read verses 5 through 9.

> "Obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ."

**It's not the most inspiring subject, and yet, it is so important, because when you stop and consider how much of your time, how much of your life is built around your work...**

### Part 1: Biblical Perspective on Work

#### 1. Work as a Whole Life Religion

This passage raises a lot of thorny issues, and fortunately since we're not making the Christian and work a series, I'll just pass lightly on all of them, but again they're important. **Christianity is a whole life religion, that Christianity has to touch every part of your life.**

- Christianity is not a Sunday thing or an evening thing.
- It's an all day, it's a whole life thing.

#### 2. Being Filled with the Spirit

Paul is still telling people what it means to be filled with the spirit. **The heart is affected by the spirit.** In the Bible, the word heart is the seat of the whole soul.

### Part 2: The Two False Views of Work

#### 1. Work as a Curse

The first false view of work is that work is a curse and that leisure is the meaning of life. **Work is not a curse, it's a calling.**

#### 2. Work as the Meaning of Life

The second false view of work is that work is the meaning of life. **Work should be your dignity, not your definition.**

### Conclusion: Working for God

You've got to be a Christian to do this, because unless God is the meaning for your life and unless he's the thing you're living for, you've only got leisure money or self-fulfillment and self-actualization. **You've got to have a personal relationship with him.**

> "Jenny, he says, I know God made me for China but he also made me fast and when I run, I feel his pleasure."

Let's pray.

Now Father, we thank you that you have shown it so much here. Even though we only had a brief period of time to look at it, I pray now that you would enable us to bring you into every part of our lives so that we can truly be filled with the Spirit and we can truly honor you. Amen.

### 引言：工作的重要性

如果你有一份工作，你可能会经常想到它。但你有多少考虑过圣经对工作的看法呢？今天，在《福音与生活》中，Tim Keller 向我们展示了圣经中一些非常有帮助且实用的智慧，我们可以将其应用到我们的工作中。有些你可能会发现令人惊讶，甚至改变生活。以弗所书 6。我们将阅读第 5 到 9 节。

> "要带着敬畏和诚实的心，听从你们地上的主人，就像听从基督一样。"

**这不是最鼓舞人心的话题，但它非常重要，因为当你停下来思考你的时间和生活有多少是围绕工作构建的...**

### 第一部分：圣经对工作的看法

#### 1. 工作作为全生命的宗教

这段经文提出了许多棘手的问题，幸运的是，由于我们没有将基督教与工作作为一个系列，我将轻轻带过所有这些问题，但它们仍然很重要。**基督教是一个全生命的宗教，必须触及你生活的每一个部分。**

- 基督教不是一个星期天或晚上才做的事情。
- 它是一个全天候的，全生命的事情。

#### 2. 被圣灵充满

保罗仍在告诉人们被圣灵充满意味着什么。**心灵受到圣灵的影响。**在圣经中，心是整个灵魂的座位。

### 第二部分：关于工作的两种错误观点

#### 1. 工作是诅咒

关于工作的第一个错误观点是工作是诅咒，而休闲是生活的意义。**工作不是诅咒，而是召唤。**

#### 2. 工作是生活的意义

关于工作的第二个错误观点是工作是生活的意义。**工作应该是你的尊严，而不是你的定义。**

### 结论：为神而工作

你必须成为基督徒才能做到这一点，因为除非上帝是你生活的意义，除非他是你生活的目标，否则你只有休闲金钱或自我实现和自我实现。**你必须与他有个人关系。**

> "珍妮，他说，我知道上帝造我为中国，但他也让我跑得快，当我跑步时，我感受到他的喜悦。"

让我们祷告。

现在，父啊，我们感谢你在这里向我们展示了这么多。即使我们只有很短的时间来查看它，我现在祈求你能使我们能够将你带入我们生活的每一个部分，以便我们真正被圣灵充满，并能真正荣耀你。阿门。
