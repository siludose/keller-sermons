## English Transcript / 英文原文

Today, Tim Keller is unpacking one of the fruit  of the Spirit, helping us see what it means to move from trying to be good to truly  changing from the inside out. Tonight's Scripture reading is found on page 8 in your bulletin, and it comes from 1st  Corinthians 9 and 10. I do all this for the sake of the Gospel that I may share in its  blessings. Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the  prize. Run in such a way as to get the prize.

Everyone who competes in the games goes  into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last, but we do it to get  a crown that will last forever. Therefore, I do not run like a man running aimlessly. I do not fight like a man beating the air. No, I beat my body and make it my slave,  so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize.

These things happen to them as examples, and we're written down as warnings for us on  whom the fulfillment of the ages has come. So if you think you are standing firm, be careful  that you don't fall. No temptation has seized you except what is common to man, and God  is faithful. He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are  tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it, the word of  the Lord.

In Galatians 5, verse 22 and 23, Paul lists nine traits of a supernaturally  changed heart. There are also called the fruit of the Spirit, love, joy, peace, patience  and so on. And what we've been doing is each week taking one of them and looking at one  so that we can see these traits appear in our own lives. And tonight we come to the  last one. In the list in Galatians 5, 22 and 23, it's called self-control.

And that same  Greek word occurs here. It's a little bit hidden by our translation because the translation  says in verse 25, everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. And literally,  that's just a way the translators paraphrased or rendered a phrase that literally says, everyone  who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things. That's what Paul said. And the word  for self-control is the same word he uses in Galatians 5.

It's the word ego crottia, which  means ego, ego, self-crottia, command. Self-control is self-command. And actually it's a synonym for being  free because if you're not self-controlled, then you're out of control. If you're out of control,  then you're a slave to some other forces. And so to be free and to be self-controlled is the same  thing.

And Paul is using this illustration of the athlete preparing for a game to compete in the  game to get across the biblical understanding of self-control. Now we need this because we are not  in control. We have trouble controlling our tongues. We have trouble controlling our thoughts. We have  trouble controlling our feelings, our impulses, let alone all the millions of addictions that we can  also develop like addictions that have to do with drink or drugs or sex or spending or gambling or  eating disorders or rage.

And you can't be circumspect without coming to the end of a day and looking  back and saying, why did I say that? Why did I follow that impulse? We all have a problem with  self-control. And Paul gives us his secret. And he was one of the five or six most influential people  who ever lived.

He knew a lot about self-discipline, self-control. And here's what he tells us,  what it is. Secondly, how it, it's born in you. And then thirdly, how can grow? What it is?

How  it's born? How it grows? First of all, what it is. There's a master illustration here. He says,  if you compete in the games and he's thinking about the panhellenic games like the Olympic games.

And you're going after a prize, a crown. And by the way, you notice where he says,  the crown does not last because you didn't get medals back then in the Olympic games. You got a  literal crown and it was made out of a, it was a wreath. It was a garland, you know. You've seen  pictures of it.

And it did, of course, fade. You couldn't put your crown aside and 10 years later  look at it. You know, it literally went to, you know, turn to dust. But Paul is talking about the  self-control that an athlete has. Because if you want that prize and if you want that crown,  then everything else in your life is under control.

You might want to eat, but you can only eat  certain things. You might want to sleep in, but you have to get up to exercise. You might want to  stay out late, but you've got to get to better early. You know, every single thing in your life  is under control. So you get the prize.

Now, that's the illustration he uses to talk about  spiritual self-control and it's telling. Because let me give you two alternate approaches  to virtue. There's an ancient approach. It was the Greek idea, but it's still with us,  that the body is bad and the spirit is good. And because the body, the Greeks thought, was the  source of emotions.

And the mind was the source of your logic and your rationality. Therefore,  virtue was considered, self-control was considered, the mind over the emotions. Do the logical thing,  do the rational thing, and control and suppress your emotions because your emotions are your  lower nature. The alternate approach to virtue, which we have today, I mean, the older approach is  still with us, but we have another approach that doesn't see your emotions as the problem. It  doesn't see suppressing emotions as you're cure.

It sees suppressing of emotions as the problem. See, the modern idea says, don't do self-control, do self-discovery. Get in touch with your feelings,  find your feelings, and then express them. Don't let somebody tell you what's right or wrong for you. You find what you feel is right and wrong, what you feel you want to do, and you do it.

So,  get in touch with your feelings, express your feelings. That's the virtuous ideal. And by the way, if you want an example of these two alternate competing approaches,  just go watch Star Trek on TV because if you take the older Star Trek with Spock, you have the  traditional approach because he was always trying to suppress his emotions. But if you go into the  next TV series with data, he was always trying to express his emotions because there you have the  older and the ancient traditional and the modern post-modern approach to emotions and what you're  supposed to do with them. But the Bible says neither.

And here's the reason why. First of all,  think of the athlete. Where is the self-control coming from? Well, he has desires or she has desires  to eat, to sleep, to do these very things, but they're all under control. Why?

Because the athletes  want the prize. They want the crown. But let me ask you a question. Is that mind over emotion? No.

You know why? Because why do you want athletic excellence? Why do you want athletic glory? The desire for athletic glory and athletic excellence is a desire. It's not the conclusion of the logic.

It's a passion of a heart. And what Paul is saying here in using his illustration is that it's not  like, here's the mind and here's the emotions. All these passions are under control because there  is one passion that controls all the rest, that masters and orders all the rest. Because you want  the prize, all the other things are under control. And see, this goes along with biblical psychology.

The Bible does not divide human beings into head and heart, into faculties, like mind and emotions. In fact, if you read the Bible carefully, you'll often be confused because there's many places where  it talks about thinking from the heart. And that's because when the Bible uses the word heart,  it does not mean what we mean in the English language by heart. The heart was the center of  the personality according to the Bible. And it was the place where your fundamental commitments  existed.

It's the metaphor for your fundamental trusts and commitments. And see what you think  and what you feel and what you decide all flow from the heart because whatever you most trust,  whatever you most love, whatever your heart is most passionately trusting and loving in sets the  course for everything else. And if your heart is divided, if your heart is divided and you actually  don't have one single over mastering passion, then your life is going to be out of control. There's going to be all kinds of problems you have. So see, Paul's illustration here on the one  hand critiques the ancient idea of mind over emotions because you see the desire for the prize is not  mind versus eating is an emotion.

Oh no, actually all of our passions are combinations of thinking  and feeling. And freedom and self-control is rightly ordering your loves, rightly ordering your passions,  which is also a critique of the modern approach. Now here's what I mean by that. The modern  approach says, find your feelings and express them. Get in touch with your deepest feelings  and follow them and express them.

Well, that doesn't work. And I'll tell you the reason it doesn't work. If you actually follow your deepest feelings, you'll find that they're also contradictory that you'll  just split up. So let me give you an example. I want to eat chocolate ice cream, not low fat,  no sugar.

I want chocolate ice cream and I also would like to be thinner. And they are both very  strong emotions, very strong emotions. And so, okay, modern man, modern woman, get in touch with  your deep emotions and follow them. I want to eat chocolate ice cream. I want to be thin.

Follow them. You just split because they're at locker heads. Let me give you one that's maybe not  as comical. You want a career? You want a family?

So you want success, but you also want  relationships, one community. And the fact is, if you want to totally be committed to your career  and totally be committed to success and glory, that actually gets in the way of even nurturing a  prospective marriage partner in a relationship. Certainly gets in the way of nurturing an actual  marriage and nurturing your family. And the fact is, you can never be as successful as you would be  if you just forgot about relationships and you can never be as strong in your relationships. If you just go whole hog on your career, these things are at locker heads and you're going to have  to choose.

Often, you're going to have to choose. Now, San Augustan years ago, obviously since he's  been dead a long time, San Augustan once said that sin is disordered love. That's a brilliant  understanding of what the Bible teaches. Sin is disordered love. It's loving things out of order.

So what he says, for example, is if you choose individual glory over friendship,  so even over your family, you're actually going against the way in which God created the world  because relationships is very, very important. If you put your own individual glory first,  instead of serving other people in nurturing community, you're going against the fabric of the  world. And what that means is, there will be breakdown because you're loving secondary things  as if they were primary. And you're loving primary things that they're secondary. You're loving  things out of order.

And if you have disordered love, it leads to breakdown. And so the modern idea  that you just get in touch with your feelings and you just discover them and you get in touch with  them and you express them makes no sense because we have all these contradictory feelings,  you have to decide which are the liberating ones. See, it's more liberating to use the desire to  have good health and to lose weight, to master the need to eat every time you see something. Because in the long run, if you live twice as long, you'll eat a lot more chocolate ice cream  in the end. In other words, which of those two desires should be given the priority?

Which one should  you choose? Which one should you let engage your heart more so that you can control the other one? You have to find the right one. You have to find the one that fits in with your design. In that case, the design of your body.

And so Augustine says, if you rightly order your loves,  you will become increasingly a self-controlled, free person or put it this way. Unlike what the ancient  say, unlike what the modern say, self-control is not a matter of mind over emotions. It's not a  matter of just being in touch with your feelings. It's loving, supreme things, supremely. It's finding those supreme things and letting them engage your heart wholly,  undividedly, and that brings self-control.

Because you can see it. Paul's using an illustration  of an athlete. And he knows it's a limited illustration. I do know certain athletes that have  really pretty much in their physical life because they want the prize, they want the gold medal or  whatever. They actually have their physical life in an enormous order.

You can't pinch an inch. They're perfect about what they eat. They're perfect about how they sleep. They're perfect about  exercise. Perfect.

And yet, of course, because they have this, as Paul says, their goal is a crown  that will not last. They also only, because they have a limited crown, a limited prize,  they only have limited self-control because they might have physical self-control very often  in no offense to those of you who have been athletes or are athletes. You know, you can have your  body under incredible control and your soul be utterly a wreck. You know, destructive perfectionism,  fears, anger, everything. Paul saying, if you love the supreme thing supremely, if you seek the  crown that will last forever, then everything in your life, if you're able to get your heart fully  and supremely rested in that, everything else in your life will start to come together.

Well,  so that leads us to this question. What is that crown that will last forever? What is it? So in other words, how does this self-control really happen in our lives? And the answer is, it's not as simple as you think, because when you read that and you say,  ah, you know, they run for a crown that will not last, but we run for a crown that will last forever,  we say, oh, I know what that means.

It's a heavenly crown. Paul's talking about his salvation  that someday he's going to stand before God and God's going to say, well done, good and faithful  that's what I'm carrying. I want to please God, I want to do his will, I want to be accepted by him,  I want his salvation. Now you think that's what Paul's saying? That that's the prize,  that that's the crown that will last forever?

Uh-uh. Because I mean, if that's what he was saying  that he's working so hard to be a good Christian, he's working so hard to be a good Christian leader,  so someday he knows God will bless him and accept him and save him. If he's saying that,  he's contradicting everything else he said anywhere else in the Bible. Because everywhere Paul's always saying, I am saved in Christ, I am accepted. Salvation is a gift,  it's not something I run for, it's not something I, you know, I work for, so I don't want to be  disqualifies from the prize, you see verse 27, is he saying that if I don't really live a very good  life, I might find in the end that I'm not saved?

No, he couldn't be saying that. Well then what is it? With Christmas just around the corner, we are inviting people to sign up for our Advent  devotional series, which you can receive daily from November 30th to December 24th. The daily  meditations will help you take time to think about the meaning and joy that comes from Christ's birth. Each day of Advent, you'll receive a devotional with a meditation on a Bible passage that focuses on  why Jesus came into the world, to reconcile us to our Heavenly Father.

We believe that during this  short season, this is a great tool to help you focus on the hope, joy, peace, and love we have  through Christ's birth. You can sign up by visiting gospelonlife.com slash Advent. Again, to sign  up, go to gospelonlife.com slash Advent. In addition to the daily emails, you'll also receive a video  message each Sunday. The weekly video message starts each week of Advent with a meditation from  Tim Keller, followed by a brief discussion with Tim and Kathy talking about something they noticed  in the meditation.

It's our prayer that through this Advent series, you experience the hope and joy  that comes from Christ's birth and that it is a source of encouragement to you this Advent season. See, the goal that will give you self-control, by the way, I've been very convicted by this over  the years. This is not what you might think. The goal that brings self-control, the Paul's talking  about, this crown, is not just pleasing God, of course you're going to please God. It's not that  general, it's not that abstract, it's in verse 23.

He says, I do all this for the sake of the gospel,  but I may share in its blessings. Now again, the English, on the surface, even that looks like he's  saying this, I am striving with all my might that someday I might experience the blessings of  salvation in my life. That's not what he's saying. Here's the reason why. First of all, the word share,  there's two aspects of this very complex verb that can't be gotten across with the simple English  translation.

First of all, the word share means share with others, something you already have. So the first thing he's saying is, the great passion of my life is not to get salvation,  I've already got it, but to share the blessings that I'm having. And what Paul is saying is I'm  experiencing some kind of bliss, some kind of joy, some kind of beauty, something in the gospel,  and I don't want to enjoy it alone. I'm more than anything else want to make sure that other  people are enjoying it too, but that's not always talking about. Because this word that can be translated  share can also be translated, participate.

And what he's saying is, I want to participate in the  gospel in such a way that all kinds of other people experience the blessings I'm having in it. What does that mean? And all the commentators are actually in agreement about Paul is trying to say  not simply that he wants to evangelize people, not simply that he's just trying to proclaim the  gospel so you can see a lot of people get converted. That's not what he's saying. Only what he's  actually saying is, I want to so embody the gospel, I want to so participate in the gospel,  I want to so reflect the gospel, I want to so display the gospel in my life that anybody,  anybody at all who looks into my heart into my life will see how the gospel operates,  will see the beauty that I see at it.

And this is an absolutely comprehensive life goal. See, if I really thought of this as mainly that his great goal is just simply to see a lot of  other people become Christians like he is, if that was, if I adopted that as a goal, it wouldn't be  enough to give me self control, you know why? If my goal was to see a lot of people become Christians,  I would work strictly on my rhetorical skills. I would make sure that I totally discipline the  parts of my life I needed to discipline in order to stand up here and do what I'm doing right now  really well. But there's all kinds of other things that I would be free to do, you know,  otherwise there's all, by the way, I have to tell you this, you can definitely be a great performer  and some of you know this.

You can be an incredible performer. You can even be a great Christian  teacher, a great Christian preacher, a great Christian evangelist, while other parts of your  life are falling apart. Because if the goal, if this overarching goal is strictly just that,  it's only to, you know, see people become Christians and all that, that's not the only goal. The  goal is to say, I want anybody who looks deep into my heart to see that the gospel completely  dominates me, that if you want to understand how the gospel works, if you want to understand how  God's salvation works, I'll embody it for you. I'll display it for you.

I'll represent it. I'll  reflect it. And if that is Paul, Paul's telling us, if that is the over mastering unified passion  of your life, it is the supreme passion of your life. It's not just one good thing that you like  to get done among others. If it's the supreme passion of your life, you're going to find it brings  everything else into self-control, under control.

You say, well, how do I even get started with that? Here's how you get started with that. When Paul says in verse 26 and 27, I'm like a runner, see? I  do not run like a man running aimlessly. I beat my body and make it my slave.

By the way, that,  don't be thrown by verse 27. I beat my body. That's not Paul saying the body is bad. He's not  an ascetic here, like the ancient ascetics that really thought the body was bad, the spirit is good,  so they just hurt their body just to become more spiritual. He's not talking like that.

He's working  through the metaphor of the athlete. He is saying that just as an athlete runs until your heart feels  like it's going to give out, runs even though you're in agony, runs and runs. He says, I am  like a runner, spiritually speaking, not physically. Why? Because of this incredible goal.

So when he says that life, and I love that, the idea of life being a race, it's not a santa,  it's not a walk through the woods, life is a race because life is hard, life is challenging. See, your heart constantly feels like it's a breaking. That's another good thing, but I can tell you,  the only time I've ever really run very long distances, I feel like my heart is just going to explode. And frankly, that's life. Your heart's always breaking.

It's hard, so life is like a race. Paul says,  and I'm in the race, but I'm trying to race in such a way that I get my crown. Well, you know what? Paul's not the only person that talks about life for us being a race. In the book of Hebrews, it also says life is like a race, but the book of Hebrews gives us the secret  for how you can run in such a way that you're not disqualified.

Because in Hebrews chapter 12, we read this,  let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles and let us run  with endurance, the race that is marked out for us. How? Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and  finisher of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scored its shame and sat  down at the right hand of the throne of God. See what the book of Hebrews is saying? If you want to  run well, look to Jesus because he ran well.

Jesus was a runner. Jesus left heaven and came to  earth and became a human being, and he ran the race of being a human being, and he ran all the way  to the cross, and he endured, and he never gave up. Even though not only did he feel like his heart  was breaking, but Jesus' heart actually did break, because when they spirit him, out came blood and water. Well, why did he run? For the prize, what was the prize?

The joy that set before him. What was that? What joy did Jesus Christ have to come to earth to win that he didn't already have in heaven? Did he come to earth and he ran for the glory of the Father? Yeah, but he already was living  for the glory of the Father.

I mean, he already had that. Was he trying to love Father? Yes, of course,  when he was on earth, he loved the Father, but he already had that. What prize did he not have  that he could only win if he came to earth and ran the race and went to the cross? What's the answer?

You and me, you were Jesus' crown, you were Jesus' glory,  you were the most precious thing, and when he ran that race, you realized that he was the only  human being that ever ran the race who deserved the crown of life. See, Jesus Christ loved God  with all his heart, soul, strength, and mind, and he loved his neighbors himself just like you and I  are supposed to be living. But you see, none of us love God like we should. None of us love each other,  other people as we should. We're all disqualified.

None of us should get the crown. Jesus is the only  human being who ever ran the race that deserved the crown of life, right? But when he ran that race  perfectly and he got the end of his life, what did he get? Oh, he got a crown. What was it?

Was the crown of thorns? He got a wreath on his head too. But he took the crown of thorns that you and I deserve for the way in which we've run. See,  we were disqualified, but he took the crown of thorns so that when you believe in him, we get the  crown of life that his running of the race earned. You don't consider that beautiful.

You don't  find that astounding. Whenever you see something of incredible beauty, you want other people to see it  and share in its blessings, don't you? When you hear great music, don't you grab your friend and say,  you know, stick your iPod in their careers? Listen to this because you want the person to go, wow,  why? Well, you love your friend, but also your friend's joy in the same beauty completes your joy  in it.

The more he or she enjoys what you found beautiful, the more you enjoy it to. It's just  natural. It's just an impulse. And what Paul is saying is when I see what Jesus did for me, how he ran  the race and he took the crown of thorns and I might have the crown of life. When I realized that I  am his crown, you are his crown.

When I realized he loves us like that, that what? That's beautiful. And that captures my imagination and that captures my heart. There's a place in the book of Psalms  where the Psalmist says, you knight my heart to fear thy name. See, our hearts are divided.

That's  how we don't have self-control. You knight my heart. And this will do it. Looking at the gospel,  looking into the beauty and the love of the gospel and the grace of the gospel until  it just becomes the over mastering passion of your life, that unites your life, unites your heart. And then you've got something that will bring every part of your life into control.

I think I need to, you know, I know that if you stop here without any kind of practical  guidelines, some people say, this is inspiring, but I'm not sure how to get my hands on it around it. At the very, the last three verses there, which I actually called out of chapter 10,  which is a little further down in the text, there's actually three very practical things there that  will help you, I think, see this kind of self-control grow. And here's what those three things are,  the Bible, community, and trouble. The Bible, community, and trouble. Those three things  will press you to look to Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.

And the more you look at him  and the more you love him and the more you see him, the more your life will come under control. What are those three things? First of all, look at verse 11. This is very fast. These things  happen to them as examples and were written down.

Now he's looking, actually he's referring to what  he just talked about in the book of Exodus. He was quoting the book of Exodus and about the wilderness  wanderings of Israel. And he was using this earlier in the chapter to apply to them. And here's  what I conclude. When you see Jesus Christ being tempted.

And what's the temptation? Attemptation is a test of your self-control. Whenever Jesus is attacked by Satan, whenever Jesus is  attacked by the religious leaders, even when Jesus is attacked by his executioners and crucified,  how did he handle every temptation? Scripture. He quoted Scripture.

He knew the Scripture. He was so saturated in the Scripture that whatever happened, it came to mind. And that's the first  practical thing I can tell you for self-control. No matter what your problem with self-control is,  if when you're being tested, the Scripture just comes right to mind. It's an amazing help  because it automatically turns your heart to look to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith.

You need a so-no Scripture, so memorized Scripture, so be saturated in it. That when the test  comes, it comes to mind. And that's the first very, very practical way to have this self-control  grow. Secondly, community. Because verse 12 says, so if you think you are standing firm, be careful  you don't fall.

That's an exhortation. He's telling the Corinthians, you are overconfident. You're overconfident and you're setting yourself up for a fall. What is he doing? He's rebuking them.

He's exhorting them. And I can tell you this, you will never experience growth  in self-control. If you don't open your heart to a few other Christians who can hold you accountable,  who can speak into your life as it were. Hebrews 3-13 exhort one another daily,  lest you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. You've got to have people who can come and talk  to you or you will not grow in self-control.

So Bible, community accountability, but lastly,  look at the last verse, which I already started to read, no temptation has seized you. The tests, they come upon you, difficulties, difficulties, they test your self-control. No temptation has seized you, except which is common to other people. God is faithful,  and he won't let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you're tempted, he will provide  a way out so you can stand up under it.

And all this, you can have a whole sermon on this,  but I can point this out to you. No one grows in self-control unless tests seize you,  difficulties seize you, and you just have to cling to God in his faithfulness to get you through it. Nobody ever really knew where you had problems with self-control unless tests come into your life  that show you you don't have the self-control you thought. And therefore, unless you have difficulties,  difficulties that drive you into the arms of God, and difficulties that drive you into the arms  of your community, your friends, and drive you into the scripture, you're not going to grow in  self-control. But every time these things happen, these tests and trials, you just go to God and say,  Lord Jesus, make by self to me a living bright reality.

Be more real to me than you ever  been before. And he will be. And more and more, you will grow in self-control. Let's pray. Our Father,  we all struggle with self-control.

And actually, our struggles in very many cases  are rather secret. Not all of them. Plenty of us have struggles with self-control that all of our  friends can see. But there's an awful lot of our struggles that we keep pretty secret. And I pray  that you would take the search light of your word, and with the power of your spirit, take these  these words of the scripture into our hearts where we maybe keep things rather dark.

We don't  want to admit our problems. We don't know what to do with them. And I pray that the words of this  text of the Word of God will illuminate our hearts so we know what we should be doing. We pray that you would help us be more accountable to each other. We would cling more to you, that we would deal with these problems because they're hurting us,  and they're hurting, especially, our ability to help other people share in the blessings of the  gospel.

Oh, Lord, help us. Please help us to grow in grace in the knowledge of your Son,  Jesus Christ, and His name we pray. Amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

Today, Tim Keller is unpacking one of the fruit  of the Spirit, helping us see what it means to move from trying to be good to truly  changing from the inside out. Tonight's Scripture reading is found on page 8 in your bulletin, and it comes from 1st  Corinthians 9 and 10. I do all this for the sake of the Gospel that I may share in its  blessings. Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the  prize. Run in such a way as to get the prize.

Everyone who competes in the games goes  into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last, but we do it to get  a crown that will last forever. Therefore, I do not run like a man running aimlessly. I do not fight like a man beating the air. No, I beat my body and make it my slave,  so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize.

These things happen to them as examples, and we're written down as warnings for us on  whom the fulfillment of the ages has come. So if you think you are standing firm, be careful  that you don't fall. No temptation has seized you except what is common to man, and God  is faithful. He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are  tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it, the word of  the Lord.

In Galatians 5, verse 22 and 23, Paul lists nine traits of a supernaturally  changed heart. There are also called the fruit of the Spirit, love, joy, peace, patience  and so on. And what we've been doing is each week taking one of them and looking at one  so that we can see these traits appear in our own lives. And tonight we come to the  last one. In the list in Galatians 5, 22 and 23, it's called self-control.

And that same  Greek word occurs here. It's a little bit hidden by our translation because the translation  says in verse 25, everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. And literally,  that's just a way the translators paraphrased or rendered a phrase that literally says, everyone  who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things. That's what Paul said. And the word  for self-control is the same word he uses in Galatians 5.

It's the word ego crottia, which  means ego, ego, self-crottia, command. Self-control is self-command. And actually it's a synonym for being  free because if you're not self-controlled, then you're out of control. If you're out of control,  then you're a slave to some other forces. And so to be free and to be self-controlled is the same  thing.

And Paul is using this illustration of the athlete preparing for a game to compete in the  game to get across the biblical understanding of self-control. Now we need this because we are not  in control. We have trouble controlling our tongues. We have trouble controlling our thoughts. We have  trouble controlling our feelings, our impulses, let alone all the millions of addictions that we can  also develop like addictions that have to do with drink or drugs or sex or spending or gambling or  eating disorders or rage.

And you can't be circumspect without coming to the end of a day and looking  back and saying, why did I say that? Why did I follow that impulse? We all have a problem with  self-control. And Paul gives us his secret. And he was one of the five or six most influential people  who ever lived.

He knew a lot about self-discipline, self-control. And here's what he tells us,  what it is. Secondly, how it, it's born in you. And then thirdly, how can grow? What it is?

How  it's born? How it grows? First of all, what it is. There's a master illustration here. He says,  if you compete in the games and he's thinking about the panhellenic games like the Olympic games.

And you're going after a prize, a crown. And by the way, you notice where he says,  the crown does not last because you didn't get medals back then in the Olympic games. You got a  literal crown and it was made out of a, it was a wreath. It was a garland, you know. You've seen  pictures of it.

And it did, of course, fade. You couldn't put your crown aside and 10 years later  look at it. You know, it literally went to, you know, turn to dust. But Paul is talking about the  self-control that an athlete has. Because if you want that prize and if you want that crown,  then everything else in your life is under control.

You might want to eat, but you can only eat  certain things. You might want to sleep in, but you have to get up to exercise. You might want to  stay out late, but you've got to get to better early. You know, every single thing in your life  is under control. So you get the prize.

Now, that's the illustration he uses to talk about  spiritual self-control and it's telling. Because let me give you two alternate approaches  to virtue. There's an ancient approach. It was the Greek idea, but it's still with us,  that the body is bad and the spirit is good. And because the body, the Greeks thought, was the  source of emotions.

And the mind was the source of your logic and your rationality. Therefore,  virtue was considered, self-control was considered, the mind over the emotions. Do the logical thing,  do the rational thing, and control and suppress your emotions because your emotions are your  lower nature. The alternate approach to virtue, which we have today, I mean, the older approach is  still with us, but we have another approach that doesn't see your emotions as the problem. It  doesn't see suppressing emotions as you're cure.

It sees suppressing of emotions as the problem. See, the modern idea says, don't do self-control, do self-discovery. Get in touch with your feelings,  find your feelings, and then express them. Don't let somebody tell you what's right or wrong for you. You find what you feel is right and wrong, what you feel you want to do, and you do it.

So,  get in touch with your feelings, express your feelings. That's the virtuous ideal. And by the way, if you want an example of these two alternate competing approaches,  just go watch Star Trek on TV because if you take the older Star Trek with Spock, you have the  traditional approach because he was always trying to suppress his emotions. But if you go into the  next TV series with data, he was always trying to express his emotions because there you have the  older and the ancient traditional and the modern post-modern approach to emotions and what you're  supposed to do with them. But the Bible says neither.

And here's the reason why. First of all,  think of the athlete. Where is the self-control coming from? Well, he has desires or she has desires  to eat, to sleep, to do these very things, but they're all under control. Why?

Because the athletes  want the prize. They want the crown. But let me ask you a question. Is that mind over emotion? No.

You know why? Because why do you want athletic excellence? Why do you want athletic glory? The desire for athletic glory and athletic excellence is a desire. It's not the conclusion of the logic.

It's a passion of a heart. And what Paul is saying here in using his illustration is that it's not  like, here's the mind and here's the emotions. All these passions are under control because there  is one passion that controls all the rest, that masters and orders all the rest. Because you want  the prize, all the other things are under control. And see, this goes along with biblical psychology.

The Bible does not divide human beings into head and heart, into faculties, like mind and emotions. In fact, if you read the Bible carefully, you'll often be confused because there's many places where  it talks about thinking from the heart. And that's because when the Bible uses the word heart,  it does not mean what we mean in the English language by heart. The heart was the center of  the personality according to the Bible. And it was the place where your fundamental commitments  existed.

It's the metaphor for your fundamental trusts and commitments. And see what you think  and what you feel and what you decide all flow from the heart because whatever you most trust,  whatever you most love, whatever your heart is most passionately trusting and loving in sets the  course for everything else. And if your heart is divided, if your heart is divided and you actually  don't have one single over mastering passion, then your life is going to be out of control. There's going to be all kinds of problems you have. So see, Paul's illustration here on the one  hand critiques the ancient idea of mind over emotions because you see the desire for the prize is not  mind versus eating is an emotion.

Oh no, actually all of our passions are combinations of thinking  and feeling. And freedom and self-control is rightly ordering your loves, rightly ordering your passions,  which is also a critique of the modern approach. Now here's what I mean by that. The modern  approach says, find your feelings and express them. Get in touch with your deepest feelings  and follow them and express them.

Well, that doesn't work. And I'll tell you the reason it doesn't work. If you actually follow your deepest feelings, you'll find that they're also contradictory that you'll  just split up. So let me give you an example. I want to eat chocolate ice cream, not low fat,  no sugar.

I want chocolate ice cream and I also would like to be thinner. And they are both very  strong emotions, very strong emotions. And so, okay, modern man, modern woman, get in touch with  your deep emotions and follow them. I want to eat chocolate ice cream. I want to be thin.

Follow them. You just split because they're at locker heads. Let me give you one that's maybe not  as comical. You want a career? You want a family?

So you want success, but you also want  relationships, one community. And the fact is, if you want to totally be committed to your career  and totally be committed to success and glory, that actually gets in the way of even nurturing a  prospective marriage partner in a relationship. Certainly gets in the way of nurturing an actual  marriage and nurturing your family. And the fact is, you can never be as successful as you would be  if you just forgot about relationships and you can never be as strong in your relationships. If you just go whole hog on your career, these things are at locker heads and you're going to have  to choose.

Often, you're going to have to choose. Now, San Augustan years ago, obviously since he's  been dead a long time, San Augustan once said that sin is disordered love. That's a brilliant  understanding of what the Bible teaches. Sin is disordered love. It's loving things out of order.

So what he says, for example, is if you choose individual glory over friendship,  so even over your family, you're actually going against the way in which God created the world  because relationships is very, very important. If you put your own individual glory first,  instead of serving other people in nurturing community, you're going against the fabric of the  world. And what that means is, there will be breakdown because you're loving secondary things  as if they were primary. And you're loving primary things that they're secondary. You're loving  things out of order.

And if you have disordered love, it leads to breakdown. And so the modern idea  that you just get in touch with your feelings and you just discover them and you get in touch with  them and you express them makes no sense because we have all these contradictory feelings,  you have to decide which are the liberating ones. See, it's more liberating to use the desire to  have good health and to lose weight, to master the need to eat every time you see something. Because in the long run, if you live twice as long, you'll eat a lot more chocolate ice cream  in the end. In other words, which of those two desires should be given the priority?

Which one should  you choose? Which one should you let engage your heart more so that you can control the other one? You have to find the right one. You have to find the one that fits in with your design. In that case, the design of your body.

And so Augustine says, if you rightly order your loves,  you will become increasingly a self-controlled, free person or put it this way. Unlike what the ancient  say, unlike what the modern say, self-control is not a matter of mind over emotions. It's not a  matter of just being in touch with your feelings. It's loving, supreme things, supremely. It's finding those supreme things and letting them engage your heart wholly,  undividedly, and that brings self-control.

Because you can see it. Paul's using an illustration  of an athlete. And he knows it's a limited illustration. I do know certain athletes that have  really pretty much in their physical life because they want the prize, they want the gold medal or  whatever. They actually have their physical life in an enormous order.

You can't pinch an inch. They're perfect about what they eat. They're perfect about how they sleep. They're perfect about  exercise. Perfect.

And yet, of course, because they have this, as Paul says, their goal is a crown  that will not last. They also only, because they have a limited crown, a limited prize,  they only have limited self-control because they might have physical self-control very often  in no offense to those of you who have been athletes or are athletes. You know, you can have your  body under incredible control and your soul be utterly a wreck. You know, destructive perfectionism,  fears, anger, everything. Paul saying, if you love the supreme thing supremely, if you seek the  crown that will last forever, then everything in your life, if you're able to get your heart fully  and supremely rested in that, everything else in your life will start to come together.

Well,  so that leads us to this question. What is that crown that will last forever? What is it? So in other words, how does this self-control really happen in our lives? And the answer is, it's not as simple as you think, because when you read that and you say,  ah, you know, they run for a crown that will not last, but we run for a crown that will last forever,  we say, oh, I know what that means.

It's a heavenly crown. Paul's talking about his salvation  that someday he's going to stand before God and God's going to say, well done, good and faithful  that's what I'm carrying. I want to please God, I want to do his will, I want to be accepted by him,  I want his salvation. Now you think that's what Paul's saying? That that's the prize,  that that's the crown that will last forever?

Uh-uh. Because I mean, if that's what he was saying  that he's working so hard to be a good Christian, he's working so hard to be a good Christian leader,  so someday he knows God will bless him and accept him and save him. If he's saying that,  he's contradicting everything else he said anywhere else in the Bible. Because everywhere Paul's always saying, I am saved in Christ, I am accepted. Salvation is a gift,  it's not something I run for, it's not something I, you know, I work for, so I don't want to be  disqualifies from the prize, you see verse 27, is he saying that if I don't really live a very good  life, I might find in the end that I'm not saved?

No, he couldn't be saying that. Well then what is it? With Christmas just around the corner, we are inviting people to sign up for our Advent  devotional series, which you can receive daily from November 30th to December 24th. The daily  meditations will help you take time to think about the meaning and joy that comes from Christ's birth. Each day of Advent, you'll receive a devotional with a meditation on a Bible passage that focuses on  why Jesus came into the world, to reconcile us to our Heavenly Father.

We believe that during this  short season, this is a great tool to help you focus on the hope, joy, peace, and love we have  through Christ's birth. You can sign up by visiting gospelonlife.com slash Advent. Again, to sign  up, go to gospelonlife.com slash Advent. In addition to the daily emails, you'll also receive a video  message each Sunday. The weekly video message starts each week of Advent with a meditation from  Tim Keller, followed by a brief discussion with Tim and Kathy talking about something they noticed  in the meditation.

It's our prayer that through this Advent series, you experience the hope and joy  that comes from Christ's birth and that it is a source of encouragement to you this Advent season. See, the goal that will give you self-control, by the way, I've been very convicted by this over  the years. This is not what you might think. The goal that brings self-control, the Paul's talking  about, this crown, is not just pleasing God, of course you're going to please God. It's not that  general, it's not that abstract, it's in verse 23.

He says, I do all this for the sake of the gospel,  but I may share in its blessings. Now again, the English, on the surface, even that looks like he's  saying this, I am striving with all my might that someday I might experience the blessings of  salvation in my life. That's not what he's saying. Here's the reason why. First of all, the word share,  there's two aspects of this very complex verb that can't be gotten across with the simple English  translation.

First of all, the word share means share with others, something you already have. So the first thing he's saying is, the great passion of my life is not to get salvation,  I've already got it, but to share the blessings that I'm having. And what Paul is saying is I'm  experiencing some kind of bliss, some kind of joy, some kind of beauty, something in the gospel,  and I don't want to enjoy it alone. I'm more than anything else want to make sure that other  people are enjoying it too, but that's not always talking about. Because this word that can be translated  share can also be translated, participate.

And what he's saying is, I want to participate in the  gospel in such a way that all kinds of other people experience the blessings I'm having in it. What does that mean? And all the commentators are actually in agreement about Paul is trying to say  not simply that he wants to evangelize people, not simply that he's just trying to proclaim the  gospel so you can see a lot of people get converted. That's not what he's saying. Only what he's  actually saying is, I want to so embody the gospel, I want to so participate in the gospel,  I want to so reflect the gospel, I want to so display the gospel in my life that anybody,  anybody at all who looks into my heart into my life will see how the gospel operates,  will see the beauty that I see at it.

And this is an absolutely comprehensive life goal. See, if I really thought of this as mainly that his great goal is just simply to see a lot of  other people become Christians like he is, if that was, if I adopted that as a goal, it wouldn't be  enough to give me self control, you know why? If my goal was to see a lot of people become Christians,  I would work strictly on my rhetorical skills. I would make sure that I totally discipline the  parts of my life I needed to discipline in order to stand up here and do what I'm doing right now  really well. But there's all kinds of other things that I would be free to do, you know,  otherwise there's all, by the way, I have to tell you this, you can definitely be a great performer  and some of you know this.

You can be an incredible performer. You can even be a great Christian  teacher, a great Christian preacher, a great Christian evangelist, while other parts of your  life are falling apart. Because if the goal, if this overarching goal is strictly just that,  it's only to, you know, see people become Christians and all that, that's not the only goal. The  goal is to say, I want anybody who looks deep into my heart to see that the gospel completely  dominates me, that if you want to understand how the gospel works, if you want to understand how  God's salvation works, I'll embody it for you. I'll display it for you.

I'll represent it. I'll  reflect it. And if that is Paul, Paul's telling us, if that is the over mastering unified passion  of your life, it is the supreme passion of your life. It's not just one good thing that you like  to get done among others. If it's the supreme passion of your life, you're going to find it brings  everything else into self-control, under control.

You say, well, how do I even get started with that? Here's how you get started with that. When Paul says in verse 26 and 27, I'm like a runner, see? I  do not run like a man running aimlessly. I beat my body and make it my slave.

By the way, that,  don't be thrown by verse 27. I beat my body. That's not Paul saying the body is bad. He's not  an ascetic here, like the ancient ascetics that really thought the body was bad, the spirit is good,  so they just hurt their body just to become more spiritual. He's not talking like that.

He's working  through the metaphor of the athlete. He is saying that just as an athlete runs until your heart feels  like it's going to give out, runs even though you're in agony, runs and runs. He says, I am  like a runner, spiritually speaking, not physically. Why? Because of this incredible goal.

So when he says that life, and I love that, the idea of life being a race, it's not a santa,  it's not a walk through the woods, life is a race because life is hard, life is challenging. See, your heart constantly feels like it's a breaking. That's another good thing, but I can tell you,  the only time I've ever really run very long distances, I feel like my heart is just going to explode. And frankly, that's life. Your heart's always breaking.

It's hard, so life is like a race. Paul says,  and I'm in the race, but I'm trying to race in such a way that I get my crown. Well, you know what? Paul's not the only person that talks about life for us being a race. In the book of Hebrews, it also says life is like a race, but the book of Hebrews gives us the secret  for how you can run in such a way that you're not disqualified.

Because in Hebrews chapter 12, we read this,  let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles and let us run  with endurance, the race that is marked out for us. How? Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and  finisher of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scored its shame and sat  down at the right hand of the throne of God. See what the book of Hebrews is saying? If you want to  run well, look to Jesus because he ran well.

Jesus was a runner. Jesus left heaven and came to  earth and became a human being, and he ran the race of being a human being, and he ran all the way  to the cross, and he endured, and he never gave up. Even though not only did he feel like his heart  was breaking, but Jesus' heart actually did break, because when they spirit him, out came blood and water. Well, why did he run? For the prize, what was the prize?

The joy that set before him. What was that? What joy did Jesus Christ have to come to earth to win that he didn't already have in heaven? Did he come to earth and he ran for the glory of the Father? Yeah, but he already was living  for the glory of the Father.

I mean, he already had that. Was he trying to love Father? Yes, of course,  when he was on earth, he loved the Father, but he already had that. What prize did he not have  that he could only win if he came to earth and ran the race and went to the cross? What's the answer?

You and me, you were Jesus' crown, you were Jesus' glory,  you were the most precious thing, and when he ran that race, you realized that he was the only  human being that ever ran the race who deserved the crown of life. See, Jesus Christ loved God  with all his heart, soul, strength, and mind, and he loved his neighbors himself just like you and I  are supposed to be living. But you see, none of us love God like we should. None of us love each other,  other people as we should. We're all disqualified.

None of us should get the crown. Jesus is the only  human being who ever ran the race that deserved the crown of life, right? But when he ran that race  perfectly and he got the end of his life, what did he get? Oh, he got a crown. What was it?

Was the crown of thorns? He got a wreath on his head too. But he took the crown of thorns that you and I deserve for the way in which we've run. See,  we were disqualified, but he took the crown of thorns so that when you believe in him, we get the  crown of life that his running of the race earned. You don't consider that beautiful.

You don't  find that astounding. Whenever you see something of incredible beauty, you want other people to see it  and share in its blessings, don't you? When you hear great music, don't you grab your friend and say,  you know, stick your iPod in their careers? Listen to this because you want the person to go, wow,  why? Well, you love your friend, but also your friend's joy in the same beauty completes your joy  in it.

The more he or she enjoys what you found beautiful, the more you enjoy it to. It's just  natural. It's just an impulse. And what Paul is saying is when I see what Jesus did for me, how he ran  the race and he took the crown of thorns and I might have the crown of life. When I realized that I  am his crown, you are his crown.

When I realized he loves us like that, that what? That's beautiful. And that captures my imagination and that captures my heart. There's a place in the book of Psalms  where the Psalmist says, you knight my heart to fear thy name. See, our hearts are divided.

That's  how we don't have self-control. You knight my heart. And this will do it. Looking at the gospel,  looking into the beauty and the love of the gospel and the grace of the gospel until  it just becomes the over mastering passion of your life, that unites your life, unites your heart. And then you've got something that will bring every part of your life into control.

I think I need to, you know, I know that if you stop here without any kind of practical  guidelines, some people say, this is inspiring, but I'm not sure how to get my hands on it around it. At the very, the last three verses there, which I actually called out of chapter 10,  which is a little further down in the text, there's actually three very practical things there that  will help you, I think, see this kind of self-control grow. And here's what those three things are,  the Bible, community, and trouble. The Bible, community, and trouble. Those three things  will press you to look to Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.

And the more you look at him  and the more you love him and the more you see him, the more your life will come under control. What are those three things? First of all, look at verse 11. This is very fast. These things  happen to them as examples and were written down.

Now he's looking, actually he's referring to what  he just talked about in the book of Exodus. He was quoting the book of Exodus and about the wilderness  wanderings of Israel. And he was using this earlier in the chapter to apply to them. And here's  what I conclude. When you see Jesus Christ being tempted.

And what's the temptation? Attemptation is a test of your self-control. Whenever Jesus is attacked by Satan, whenever Jesus is  attacked by the religious leaders, even when Jesus is attacked by his executioners and crucified,  how did he handle every temptation? Scripture. He quoted Scripture.

He knew the Scripture. He was so saturated in the Scripture that whatever happened, it came to mind. And that's the first  practical thing I can tell you for self-control. No matter what your problem with self-control is,  if when you're being tested, the Scripture just comes right to mind. It's an amazing help  because it automatically turns your heart to look to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith.

You need a so-no Scripture, so memorized Scripture, so be saturated in it. That when the test  comes, it comes to mind. And that's the first very, very practical way to have this self-control  grow. Secondly, community. Because verse 12 says, so if you think you are standing firm, be careful  you don't fall.

That's an exhortation. He's telling the Corinthians, you are overconfident. You're overconfident and you're setting yourself up for a fall. What is he doing? He's rebuking them.

He's exhorting them. And I can tell you this, you will never experience growth  in self-control. If you don't open your heart to a few other Christians who can hold you accountable,  who can speak into your life as it were. Hebrews 3-13 exhort one another daily,  lest you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. You've got to have people who can come and talk  to you or you will not grow in self-control.

So Bible, community accountability, but lastly,  look at the last verse, which I already started to read, no temptation has seized you. The tests, they come upon you, difficulties, difficulties, they test your self-control. No temptation has seized you, except which is common to other people. God is faithful,  and he won't let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you're tempted, he will provide  a way out so you can stand up under it.

And all this, you can have a whole sermon on this,  but I can point this out to you. No one grows in self-control unless tests seize you,  difficulties seize you, and you just have to cling to God in his faithfulness to get you through it. Nobody ever really knew where you had problems with self-control unless tests come into your life  that show you you don't have the self-control you thought. And therefore, unless you have difficulties,  difficulties that drive you into the arms of God, and difficulties that drive you into the arms  of your community, your friends, and drive you into the scripture, you're not going to grow in  self-control. But every time these things happen, these tests and trials, you just go to God and say,  Lord Jesus, make by self to me a living bright reality.

Be more real to me than you ever  been before. And he will be. And more and more, you will grow in self-control. Let's pray. Our Father,  we all struggle with self-control.

And actually, our struggles in very many cases  are rather secret. Not all of them. Plenty of us have struggles with self-control that all of our  friends can see. But there's an awful lot of our struggles that we keep pretty secret. And I pray  that you would take the search light of your word, and with the power of your spirit, take these  these words of the scripture into our hearts where we maybe keep things rather dark.

We don't  want to admit our problems. We don't know what to do with them. And I pray that the words of this  text of the Word of God will illuminate our hearts so we know what we should be doing. We pray that you would help us be more accountable to each other. We would cling more to you, that we would deal with these problems because they're hurting us,  and they're hurting, especially, our ability to help other people share in the blessings of the  gospel.

Oh, Lord, help us. Please help us to grow in grace in the knowledge of your Son,  Jesus Christ, and His name we pray. Amen.

### 引言：意志力与超自然改变的区别

圣经说，靠意志力驱动的心与超自然改变的心之间有天壤之别。今天，Tim Keller 正在解读圣灵的果子之一，帮助我们看到从努力做好人到真正从内心改变的意义。

今晚的经文阅读在你的公告第8页，来自哥林多前书9和10。

> “我所做的一切都是为了福音的缘故，以便我可以分享其中的祝福。你们不知道在赛跑中，所有的跑者都在跑，但只有一个能得奖吗？要以得奖的方式跑。参加比赛的人都要严格训练。他们这样做是为了得到一个不会持久的冠冕，但我们这样做是为了得到一个永恒的冠冕。因此，我不像一个漫无目的跑步的人。我不像一个打空气的人。不，我击打我的身体，使它成为我的奴仆，以便在我向别人传道之后，我自己不会因奖赏而被取消资格。”

### 圣经对自我控制的理解

在加拉太书5章22和23节，保罗列出了超自然改变的心的九个特征。这些也被称为圣灵的果子，爱、喜乐、和平、忍耐等等。我们每周都会挑选其中一个进行研究，以便我们可以在自己的生活中看到这些特征的出现。今晚我们来到最后一个。在加拉太书5章22和23节的列表中，它被称为自我控制。

> “参加比赛的人在各方面都要自我控制。”

**自我控制就是自我指挥。** 实际上，它是自由的同义词，因为如果你不自我控制，那么你就失控了。如果你失控了，那么你就是其他力量的奴隶。

### 心灵在自我控制中的角色

保罗使用运动员准备比赛的例子来传达圣经对自我控制的理解。现在我们需要这个，因为我们不在控制之中。我们难以控制我们的舌头。我们难以控制我们的思想。我们难以控制我们的感情，我们的冲动，更不用说我们还可能发展出数以百万计的成瘾，比如饮酒、毒品、性、消费、赌博、饮食失调或愤怒的成瘾。

- **理智压制情感**：古希腊的观点认为身体是坏的，精神是好的。
- **自我发现**：现代观点认为压抑情感是问题所在。

圣经说两者都不是。**自由和自我控制是正确地排列你的爱，正确地排列你的激情。**

### 永恒的冠冕

什么是那永恒的冠冕？那是什么？换句话说，这种自我控制如何真正发生在我们的生活中？答案是，这并不像你想的那么简单。

> “我所做的一切都是为了福音的缘故，以便我可以分享其中的祝福。”

保罗说的是我正在经历某种幸福，某种喜悦，某种美丽，某种福音中的东西，我不想独自享受。

### 增长自我控制的实际步骤

圣经、社区和困难。这三件事会促使你仰望耶稣，我们信心的创始成终者。你越多地仰望他，越多地爱他，越多地看到他，你的生活就越会受到控制。

1. **圣经**：要浸透在圣经中，以便在考验来临时，它会浮现在脑海中。
2. **社区**：向其他基督徒敞开心扉，让他们能对你进行监督。
3. **困难**：驱使你投靠上帝和你的社区的困难。

让我们祷告。我们的父，我们都在与自我控制作斗争。实际上，我们的斗争在许多情况下是相当秘密的。并不是所有的斗争。我们中有很多人有自我控制的问题，所有的朋友都能看到。但我们有很多斗争是我们保密的。我祈求你用你的话语的探照灯，借着你的灵的力量，将这些经文的话语带入我们心中那些我们可能保持黑暗的地方。我们不想承认我们的问题。我们不知道该如何处理它们。我祈求这些经文的话语能照亮我们的心，使我们知道我们应该做什么。我们祈求你帮助我们对彼此更加负责。我们会更加依靠你，我们会处理这些问题，因为它们在伤害我们，尤其是在伤害我们帮助其他人分享福音祝福的能力。哦，主，帮助我们。请帮助我们在你儿子耶稣基督的恩典和知识中成长。奉他的名祷告。阿门。
