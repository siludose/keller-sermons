## English Transcript / 英文原文

Today, Tim Keller is unpacking one of the fruit  of the Spirit, helping us see what it means to move from trying to be good to truly  changing from the inside out. Tonight's Scripture reading is found on page 8 in your bulletin, and it comes from 1st  Corinthians 9 and 10. I do all this for the sake of the Gospel that I may share in its  blessings. Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the  prize. Run in such a way as to get the prize.

Everyone who competes in the games goes  into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last, but we do it to get  a crown that will last forever. Therefore, I do not run like a man running aimlessly. I do not fight like a man beating the air. No, I beat my body and make it my slave,  so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize.

These things happen to them as examples, and we're written down as warnings for us on  whom the fulfillment of the ages has come. So if you think you are standing firm, be careful  that you don't fall. No temptation has seized you except what is common to man, and God  is faithful. He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are  tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it, the word of  the Lord.

In Galatians 5, verse 22 and 23, Paul lists nine traits of a supernaturally  changed heart. There are also called the fruit of the Spirit, love, joy, peace, patience  and so on. And what we've been doing is each week taking one of them and looking at one  so that we can see these traits appear in our own lives. And tonight we come to the  last one. In the list in Galatians 5, 22 and 23, it's called self-control.

And that same  Greek word occurs here. It's a little bit hidden by our translation because the translation  says in verse 25, everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. And literally,  that's just a way the translators paraphrased or rendered a phrase that literally says, everyone  who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things. That's what Paul said. And the word  for self-control is the same word he uses in Galatians 5.

It's the word ego crottia, which  means ego, ego, self-crottia, command. Self-control is self-command. And actually it's a synonym for being  free because if you're not self-controlled, then you're out of control. If you're out of control,  then you're a slave to some other forces. And so to be free and to be self-controlled is the same  thing.

And Paul is using this illustration of the athlete preparing for a game to compete in the  game to get across the biblical understanding of self-control. Now we need this because we are not  in control. We have trouble controlling our tongues. We have trouble controlling our thoughts. We have  trouble controlling our feelings, our impulses, let alone all the millions of addictions that we can  also develop like addictions that have to do with drink or drugs or sex or spending or gambling or  eating disorders or rage.

And you can't be circumspect without coming to the end of a day and looking  back and saying, why did I say that? Why did I follow that impulse? We all have a problem with  self-control. And Paul gives us his secret. And he was one of the five or six most influential people  who ever lived.

He knew a lot about self-discipline, self-control. And here's what he tells us,  what it is. Secondly, how it, it's born in you. And then thirdly, how can grow? What it is?

How  it's born? How it grows? First of all, what it is. There's a master illustration here. He says,  if you compete in the games and he's thinking about the panhellenic games like the Olympic games.

And you're going after a prize, a crown. And by the way, you notice where he says,  the crown does not last because you didn't get medals back then in the Olympic games. You got a  literal crown and it was made out of a, it was a wreath. It was a garland, you know. You've seen  pictures of it.

And it did, of course, fade. You couldn't put your crown aside and 10 years later  look at it. You know, it literally went to, you know, turn to dust. But Paul is talking about the  self-control that an athlete has. Because if you want that prize and if you want that crown,  then everything else in your life is under control.

You might want to eat, but you can only eat  certain things. You might want to sleep in, but you have to get up to exercise. You might want to  stay out late, but you've got to get to better early. You know, every single thing in your life  is under control. So you get the prize.

Now, that's the illustration he uses to talk about  spiritual self-control and it's telling. Because let me give you two alternate approaches  to virtue. There's an ancient approach. It was the Greek idea, but it's still with us,  that the body is bad and the spirit is good. And because the body, the Greeks thought, was the  source of emotions.

And the mind was the source of your logic and your rationality. Therefore,  virtue was considered, self-control was considered, the mind over the emotions. Do the logical thing,  do the rational thing, and control and suppress your emotions because your emotions are your  lower nature. The alternate approach to virtue, which we have today, I mean, the older approach is  still with us, but we have another approach that doesn't see your emotions as the problem. It  doesn't see suppressing emotions as you're cure.

It sees suppressing of emotions as the problem. See, the modern idea says, don't do self-control, do self-discovery. Get in touch with your feelings,  find your feelings, and then express them. Don't let somebody tell you what's right or wrong for you. You find what you feel is right and wrong, what you feel you want to do, and you do it.

So,  get in touch with your feelings, express your feelings. That's the virtuous ideal. And by the way, if you want an example of these two alternate competing approaches,  just go watch Star Trek on TV because if you take the older Star Trek with Spock, you have the  traditional approach because he was always trying to suppress his emotions. But if you go into the  next TV series with data, he was always trying to express his emotions because there you have the  older and the ancient traditional and the modern post-modern approach to emotions and what you're  supposed to do with them. But the Bible says neither.

And here's the reason why. First of all,  think of the athlete. Where is the self-control coming from? Well, he has desires or she has desires  to eat, to sleep, to do these very things, but they're all under control. Why?

Because the athletes  want the prize. They want the crown. But let me ask you a question. Is that mind over emotion? No.

You know why? Because why do you want athletic excellence? Why do you want athletic glory? The desire for athletic glory and athletic excellence is a desire. It's not the conclusion of the logic.

It's a passion of a heart. And what Paul is saying here in using his illustration is that it's not  like, here's the mind and here's the emotions. All these passions are under control because there  is one passion that controls all the rest, that masters and orders all the rest. Because you want  the prize, all the other things are under control. And see, this goes along with biblical psychology.

The Bible does not divide human beings into head and heart, into faculties, like mind and emotions. In fact, if you read the Bible carefully, you'll often be confused because there's many places where  it talks about thinking from the heart. And that's because when the Bible uses the word heart,  it does not mean what we mean in the English language by heart. The heart was the center of  the personality according to the Bible. And it was the place where your fundamental commitments  existed.

It's the metaphor for your fundamental trusts and commitments. And see what you think  and what you feel and what you decide all flow from the heart because whatever you most trust,  whatever you most love, whatever your heart is most passionately trusting and loving in sets the  course for everything else. And if your heart is divided, if your heart is divided and you actually  don't have one single over mastering passion, then your life is going to be out of control. There's going to be all kinds of problems you have. So see, Paul's illustration here on the one  hand critiques the ancient idea of mind over emotions because you see the desire for the prize is not  mind versus eating is an emotion.

Oh no, actually all of our passions are combinations of thinking  and feeling. And freedom and self-control is rightly ordering your loves, rightly ordering your passions,  which is also a critique of the modern approach. Now here's what I mean by that. The modern  approach says, find your feelings and express them. Get in touch with your deepest feelings  and follow them and express them.

Well, that doesn't work. And I'll tell you the reason it doesn't work. If you actually follow your deepest feelings, you'll find that they're also contradictory that you'll  just split up. So let me give you an example. I want to eat chocolate ice cream, not low fat,  no sugar.

I want chocolate ice cream and I also would like to be thinner. And they are both very  strong emotions, very strong emotions. And so, okay, modern man, modern woman, get in touch with  your deep emotions and follow them. I want to eat chocolate ice cream. I want to be thin.

Follow them. You just split because they're at locker heads. Let me give you one that's maybe not  as comical. You want a career? You want a family?

So you want success, but you also want  relationships, one community. And the fact is, if you want to totally be committed to your career  and totally be committed to success and glory, that actually gets in the way of even nurturing a  prospective marriage partner in a relationship. Certainly gets in the way of nurturing an actual  marriage and nurturing your family. And the fact is, you can never be as successful as you would be  if you just forgot about relationships and you can never be as strong in your relationships. If you just go whole hog on your career, these things are at locker heads and you're going to have  to choose.

Often, you're going to have to choose. Now, San Augustan years ago, obviously since he's  been dead a long time, San Augustan once said that sin is disordered love. That's a brilliant  understanding of what the Bible teaches. Sin is disordered love. It's loving things out of order.

So what he says, for example, is if you choose individual glory over friendship,  so even over your family, you're actually going against the way in which God created the world  because relationships is very, very important. If you put your own individual glory first,  instead of serving other people in nurturing community, you're going against the fabric of the  world. And what that means is, there will be breakdown because you're loving secondary things  as if they were primary. And you're loving primary things that they're secondary. You're loving  things out of order.

And if you have disordered love, it leads to breakdown. And so the modern idea  that you just get in touch with your feelings and you just discover them and you get in touch with  them and you express them makes no sense because we have all these contradictory feelings,  you have to decide which are the liberating ones. See, it's more liberating to use the desire to  have good health and to lose weight, to master the need to eat every time you see something. Because in the long run, if you live twice as long, you'll eat a lot more chocolate ice cream  in the end. In other words, which of those two desires should be given the priority?

Which one should  you choose? Which one should you let engage your heart more so that you can control the other one? You have to find the right one. You have to find the one that fits in with your design. In that case, the design of your body.

And so Augustine says, if you rightly order your loves,  you will become increasingly a self-controlled, free person or put it this way. Unlike what the ancient  say, unlike what the modern say, self-control is not a matter of mind over emotions. It's not a  matter of just being in touch with your feelings. It's loving, supreme things, supremely. It's finding those supreme things and letting them engage your heart wholly,  undividedly, and that brings self-control.

Because you can see it. Paul's using an illustration  of an athlete. And he knows it's a limited illustration. I do know certain athletes that have  really pretty much in their physical life because they want the prize, they want the gold medal or  whatever. They actually have their physical life in an enormous order.

You can't pinch an inch. They're perfect about what they eat. They're perfect about how they sleep. They're perfect about  exercise. Perfect.

And yet, of course, because they have this, as Paul says, their goal is a crown  that will not last. They also only, because they have a limited crown, a limited prize,  they only have limited self-control because they might have physical self-control very often  in no offense to those of you who have been athletes or are athletes. You know, you can have your  body under incredible control and your soul be utterly a wreck. You know, destructive perfectionism,  fears, anger, everything. Paul saying, if you love the supreme thing supremely, if you seek the  crown that will last forever, then everything in your life, if you're able to get your heart fully  and supremely rested in that, everything else in your life will start to come together.

Well,  so that leads us to this question. What is that crown that will last forever? What is it? So in other words, how does this self-control really happen in our lives? And the answer is, it's not as simple as you think, because when you read that and you say,  ah, you know, they run for a crown that will not last, but we run for a crown that will last forever,  we say, oh, I know what that means.

It's a heavenly crown. Paul's talking about his salvation  that someday he's going to stand before God and God's going to say, well done, good and faithful  that's what I'm carrying. I want to please God, I want to do his will, I want to be accepted by him,  I want his salvation. Now you think that's what Paul's saying? That that's the prize,  that that's the crown that will last forever?

Uh-uh. Because I mean, if that's what he was saying  that he's working so hard to be a good Christian, he's working so hard to be a good Christian leader,  so someday he knows God will bless him and accept him and save him. If he's saying that,  he's contradicting everything else he said anywhere else in the Bible. Because everywhere Paul's always saying, I am saved in Christ, I am accepted. Salvation is a gift,  it's not something I run for, it's not something I, you know, I work for, so I don't want to be  disqualifies from the prize, you see verse 27, is he saying that if I don't really live a very good  life, I might find in the end that I'm not saved?

No, he couldn't be saying that. Well then what is it? With Christmas just around the corner, we are inviting people to sign up for our Advent  devotional series, which you can receive daily from November 30th to December 24th. The daily  meditations will help you take time to think about the meaning and joy that comes from Christ's birth. Each day of Advent, you'll receive a devotional with a meditation on a Bible passage that focuses on  why Jesus came into the world, to reconcile us to our Heavenly Father.

We believe that during this  short season, this is a great tool to help you focus on the hope, joy, peace, and love we have  through Christ's birth. You can sign up by visiting gospelonlife.com slash Advent. Again, to sign  up, go to gospelonlife.com slash Advent. In addition to the daily emails, you'll also receive a video  message each Sunday. The weekly video message starts each week of Advent with a meditation from  Tim Keller, followed by a brief discussion with Tim and Kathy talking about something they noticed  in the meditation.

It's our prayer that through this Advent series, you experience the hope and joy  that comes from Christ's birth and that it is a source of encouragement to you this Advent season. See, the goal that will give you self-control, by the way, I've been very convicted by this over  the years. This is not what you might think. The goal that brings self-control, the Paul's talking  about, this crown, is not just pleasing God, of course you're going to please God. It's not that  general, it's not that abstract, it's in verse 23.

He says, I do all this for the sake of the gospel,  but I may share in its blessings. Now again, the English, on the surface, even that looks like he's  saying this, I am striving with all my might that someday I might experience the blessings of  salvation in my life. That's not what he's saying. Here's the reason why. First of all, the word share,  there's two aspects of this very complex verb that can't be gotten across with the simple English  translation.

First of all, the word share means share with others, something you already have. So the first thing he's saying is, the great passion of my life is not to get salvation,  I've already got it, but to share the blessings that I'm having. And what Paul is saying is I'm  experiencing some kind of bliss, some kind of joy, some kind of beauty, something in the gospel,  and I don't want to enjoy it alone. I'm more than anything else want to make sure that other  people are enjoying it too, but that's not always talking about. Because this word that can be translated  share can also be translated, participate.

And what he's saying is, I want to participate in the  gospel in such a way that all kinds of other people experience the blessings I'm having in it. What does that mean? And all the commentators are actually in agreement about Paul is trying to say  not simply that he wants to evangelize people, not simply that he's just trying to proclaim the  gospel so you can see a lot of people get converted. That's not what he's saying. Only what he's  actually saying is, I want to so embody the gospel, I want to so participate in the gospel,  I want to so reflect the gospel, I want to so display the gospel in my life that anybody,  anybody at all who looks into my heart into my life will see how the gospel operates,  will see the beauty that I see at it.

And this is an absolutely comprehensive life goal. See, if I really thought of this as mainly that his great goal is just simply to see a lot of  other people become Christians like he is, if that was, if I adopted that as a goal, it wouldn't be  enough to give me self control, you know why? If my goal was to see a lot of people become Christians,  I would work strictly on my rhetorical skills. I would make sure that I totally discipline the  parts of my life I needed to discipline in order to stand up here and do what I'm doing right now  really well. But there's all kinds of other things that I would be free to do, you know,  otherwise there's all, by the way, I have to tell you this, you can definitely be a great performer  and some of you know this.

You can be an incredible performer. You can even be a great Christian  teacher, a great Christian preacher, a great Christian evangelist, while other parts of your  life are falling apart. Because if the goal, if this overarching goal is strictly just that,  it's only to, you know, see people become Christians and all that, that's not the only goal. The  goal is to say, I want anybody who looks deep into my heart to see that the gospel completely  dominates me, that if you want to understand how the gospel works, if you want to understand how  God's salvation works, I'll embody it for you. I'll display it for you.

I'll represent it. I'll  reflect it. And if that is Paul, Paul's telling us, if that is the over mastering unified passion  of your life, it is the supreme passion of your life. It's not just one good thing that you like  to get done among others. If it's the supreme passion of your life, you're going to find it brings  everything else into self-control, under control.

You say, well, how do I even get started with that? Here's how you get started with that. When Paul says in verse 26 and 27, I'm like a runner, see? I  do not run like a man running aimlessly. I beat my body and make it my slave.

By the way, that,  don't be thrown by verse 27. I beat my body. That's not Paul saying the body is bad. He's not  an ascetic here, like the ancient ascetics that really thought the body was bad, the spirit is good,  so they just hurt their body just to become more spiritual. He's not talking like that.

He's working  through the metaphor of the athlete. He is saying that just as an athlete runs until your heart feels  like it's going to give out, runs even though you're in agony, runs and runs. He says, I am  like a runner, spiritually speaking, not physically. Why? Because of this incredible goal.

So when he says that life, and I love that, the idea of life being a race, it's not a santa,  it's not a walk through the woods, life is a race because life is hard, life is challenging. See, your heart constantly feels like it's a breaking. That's another good thing, but I can tell you,  the only time I've ever really run very long distances, I feel like my heart is just going to explode. And frankly, that's life. Your heart's always breaking.

It's hard, so life is like a race. Paul says,  and I'm in the race, but I'm trying to race in such a way that I get my crown. Well, you know what? Paul's not the only person that talks about life for us being a race. In the book of Hebrews, it also says life is like a race, but the book of Hebrews gives us the secret  for how you can run in such a way that you're not disqualified.

Because in Hebrews chapter 12, we read this,  let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles and let us run  with endurance, the race that is marked out for us. How? Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and  finisher of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scored its shame and sat  down at the right hand of the throne of God. See what the book of Hebrews is saying? If you want to  run well, look to Jesus because he ran well.

Jesus was a runner. Jesus left heaven and came to  earth and became a human being, and he ran the race of being a human being, and he ran all the way  to the cross, and he endured, and he never gave up. Even though not only did he feel like his heart  was breaking, but Jesus' heart actually did break, because when they spirit him, out came blood and water. Well, why did he run? For the prize, what was the prize?

The joy that set before him. What was that? What joy did Jesus Christ have to come to earth to win that he didn't already have in heaven? Did he come to earth and he ran for the glory of the Father? Yeah, but he already was living  for the glory of the Father.

I mean, he already had that. Was he trying to love Father? Yes, of course,  when he was on earth, he loved the Father, but he already had that. What prize did he not have  that he could only win if he came to earth and ran the race and went to the cross? What's the answer?

You and me, you were Jesus' crown, you were Jesus' glory,  you were the most precious thing, and when he ran that race, you realized that he was the only  human being that ever ran the race who deserved the crown of life. See, Jesus Christ loved God  with all his heart, soul, strength, and mind, and he loved his neighbors himself just like you and I  are supposed to be living. But you see, none of us love God like we should. None of us love each other,  other people as we should. We're all disqualified.

None of us should get the crown. Jesus is the only  human being who ever ran the race that deserved the crown of life, right? But when he ran that race  perfectly and he got the end of his life, what did he get? Oh, he got a crown. What was it?

Was the crown of thorns? He got a wreath on his head too. But he took the crown of thorns that you and I deserve for the way in which we've run. See,  we were disqualified, but he took the crown of thorns so that when you believe in him, we get the  crown of life that his running of the race earned. You don't consider that beautiful.

You don't  find that astounding. Whenever you see something of incredible beauty, you want other people to see it  and share in its blessings, don't you? When you hear great music, don't you grab your friend and say,  you know, stick your iPod in their careers? Listen to this because you want the person to go, wow,  why? Well, you love your friend, but also your friend's joy in the same beauty completes your joy  in it.

The more he or she enjoys what you found beautiful, the more you enjoy it to. It's just  natural. It's just an impulse. And what Paul is saying is when I see what Jesus did for me, how he ran  the race and he took the crown of thorns and I might have the crown of life. When I realized that I  am his crown, you are his crown.

When I realized he loves us like that, that what? That's beautiful. And that captures my imagination and that captures my heart. There's a place in the book of Psalms  where the Psalmist says, you knight my heart to fear thy name. See, our hearts are divided.

That's  how we don't have self-control. You knight my heart. And this will do it. Looking at the gospel,  looking into the beauty and the love of the gospel and the grace of the gospel until  it just becomes the over mastering passion of your life, that unites your life, unites your heart. And then you've got something that will bring every part of your life into control.

I think I need to, you know, I know that if you stop here without any kind of practical  guidelines, some people say, this is inspiring, but I'm not sure how to get my hands on it around it. At the very, the last three verses there, which I actually called out of chapter 10,  which is a little further down in the text, there's actually three very practical things there that  will help you, I think, see this kind of self-control grow. And here's what those three things are,  the Bible, community, and trouble. The Bible, community, and trouble. Those three things  will press you to look to Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.

And the more you look at him  and the more you love him and the more you see him, the more your life will come under control. What are those three things? First of all, look at verse 11. This is very fast. These things  happen to them as examples and were written down.

Now he's looking, actually he's referring to what  he just talked about in the book of Exodus. He was quoting the book of Exodus and about the wilderness  wanderings of Israel. And he was using this earlier in the chapter to apply to them. And here's  what I conclude. When you see Jesus Christ being tempted.

And what's the temptation? Attemptation is a test of your self-control. Whenever Jesus is attacked by Satan, whenever Jesus is  attacked by the religious leaders, even when Jesus is attacked by his executioners and crucified,  how did he handle every temptation? Scripture. He quoted Scripture.

He knew the Scripture. He was so saturated in the Scripture that whatever happened, it came to mind. And that's the first  practical thing I can tell you for self-control. No matter what your problem with self-control is,  if when you're being tested, the Scripture just comes right to mind. It's an amazing help  because it automatically turns your heart to look to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith.

You need a so-no Scripture, so memorized Scripture, so be saturated in it. That when the test  comes, it comes to mind. And that's the first very, very practical way to have this self-control  grow. Secondly, community. Because verse 12 says, so if you think you are standing firm, be careful  you don't fall.

That's an exhortation. He's telling the Corinthians, you are overconfident. You're overconfident and you're setting yourself up for a fall. What is he doing? He's rebuking them.

He's exhorting them. And I can tell you this, you will never experience growth  in self-control. If you don't open your heart to a few other Christians who can hold you accountable,  who can speak into your life as it were. Hebrews 3-13 exhort one another daily,  lest you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. You've got to have people who can come and talk  to you or you will not grow in self-control.

So Bible, community accountability, but lastly,  look at the last verse, which I already started to read, no temptation has seized you. The tests, they come upon you, difficulties, difficulties, they test your self-control. No temptation has seized you, except which is common to other people. God is faithful,  and he won't let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you're tempted, he will provide  a way out so you can stand up under it.

And all this, you can have a whole sermon on this,  but I can point this out to you. No one grows in self-control unless tests seize you,  difficulties seize you, and you just have to cling to God in his faithfulness to get you through it. Nobody ever really knew where you had problems with self-control unless tests come into your life  that show you you don't have the self-control you thought. And therefore, unless you have difficulties,  difficulties that drive you into the arms of God, and difficulties that drive you into the arms  of your community, your friends, and drive you into the scripture, you're not going to grow in  self-control. But every time these things happen, these tests and trials, you just go to God and say,  Lord Jesus, make by self to me a living bright reality.

Be more real to me than you ever  been before. And he will be. And more and more, you will grow in self-control. Let's pray. Our Father,  we all struggle with self-control.

And actually, our struggles in very many cases  are rather secret. Not all of them. Plenty of us have struggles with self-control that all of our  friends can see. But there's an awful lot of our struggles that we keep pretty secret. And I pray  that you would take the search light of your word, and with the power of your spirit, take these  these words of the scripture into our hearts where we maybe keep things rather dark.

We don't  want to admit our problems. We don't know what to do with them. And I pray that the words of this  text of the Word of God will illuminate our hearts so we know what we should be doing. We pray that you would help us be more accountable to each other. We would cling more to you, that we would deal with these problems because they're hurting us,  and they're hurting, especially, our ability to help other people share in the blessings of the  gospel.

Oh, Lord, help us. Please help us to grow in grace in the knowledge of your Son,  Jesus Christ, and His name we pray. Amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

Today, Tim Keller is unpacking one of the fruit  of the Spirit, helping us see what it means to move from trying to be good to truly  changing from the inside out. Tonight's Scripture reading is found on page 8 in your bulletin, and it comes from 1st  Corinthians 9 and 10. I do all this for the sake of the Gospel that I may share in its  blessings. Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the  prize. Run in such a way as to get the prize.

Everyone who competes in the games goes  into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last, but we do it to get  a crown that will last forever. Therefore, I do not run like a man running aimlessly. I do not fight like a man beating the air. No, I beat my body and make it my slave,  so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize.

These things happen to them as examples, and we're written down as warnings for us on  whom the fulfillment of the ages has come. So if you think you are standing firm, be careful  that you don't fall. No temptation has seized you except what is common to man, and God  is faithful. He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are  tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it, the word of  the Lord.

In Galatians 5, verse 22 and 23, Paul lists nine traits of a supernaturally  changed heart. There are also called the fruit of the Spirit, love, joy, peace, patience  and so on. And what we've been doing is each week taking one of them and looking at one  so that we can see these traits appear in our own lives. And tonight we come to the  last one. In the list in Galatians 5, 22 and 23, it's called self-control.

And that same  Greek word occurs here. It's a little bit hidden by our translation because the translation  says in verse 25, everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. And literally,  that's just a way the translators paraphrased or rendered a phrase that literally says, everyone  who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things. That's what Paul said. And the word  for self-control is the same word he uses in Galatians 5.

It's the word ego crottia, which  means ego, ego, self-crottia, command. Self-control is self-command. And actually it's a synonym for being  free because if you're not self-controlled, then you're out of control. If you're out of control,  then you're a slave to some other forces. And so to be free and to be self-controlled is the same  thing.

And Paul is using this illustration of the athlete preparing for a game to compete in the  game to get across the biblical understanding of self-control. Now we need this because we are not  in control. We have trouble controlling our tongues. We have trouble controlling our thoughts. We have  trouble controlling our feelings, our impulses, let alone all the millions of addictions that we can  also develop like addictions that have to do with drink or drugs or sex or spending or gambling or  eating disorders or rage.

And you can't be circumspect without coming to the end of a day and looking  back and saying, why did I say that? Why did I follow that impulse? We all have a problem with  self-control. And Paul gives us his secret. And he was one of the five or six most influential people  who ever lived.

He knew a lot about self-discipline, self-control. And here's what he tells us,  what it is. Secondly, how it, it's born in you. And then thirdly, how can grow? What it is?

How  it's born? How it grows? First of all, what it is. There's a master illustration here. He says,  if you compete in the games and he's thinking about the panhellenic games like the Olympic games.

And you're going after a prize, a crown. And by the way, you notice where he says,  the crown does not last because you didn't get medals back then in the Olympic games. You got a  literal crown and it was made out of a, it was a wreath. It was a garland, you know. You've seen  pictures of it.

And it did, of course, fade. You couldn't put your crown aside and 10 years later  look at it. You know, it literally went to, you know, turn to dust. But Paul is talking about the  self-control that an athlete has. Because if you want that prize and if you want that crown,  then everything else in your life is under control.

You might want to eat, but you can only eat  certain things. You might want to sleep in, but you have to get up to exercise. You might want to  stay out late, but you've got to get to better early. You know, every single thing in your life  is under control. So you get the prize.

Now, that's the illustration he uses to talk about  spiritual self-control and it's telling. Because let me give you two alternate approaches  to virtue. There's an ancient approach. It was the Greek idea, but it's still with us,  that the body is bad and the spirit is good. And because the body, the Greeks thought, was the  source of emotions.

And the mind was the source of your logic and your rationality. Therefore,  virtue was considered, self-control was considered, the mind over the emotions. Do the logical thing,  do the rational thing, and control and suppress your emotions because your emotions are your  lower nature. The alternate approach to virtue, which we have today, I mean, the older approach is  still with us, but we have another approach that doesn't see your emotions as the problem. It  doesn't see suppressing emotions as you're cure.

It sees suppressing of emotions as the problem. See, the modern idea says, don't do self-control, do self-discovery. Get in touch with your feelings,  find your feelings, and then express them. Don't let somebody tell you what's right or wrong for you. You find what you feel is right and wrong, what you feel you want to do, and you do it.

So,  get in touch with your feelings, express your feelings. That's the virtuous ideal. And by the way, if you want an example of these two alternate competing approaches,  just go watch Star Trek on TV because if you take the older Star Trek with Spock, you have the  traditional approach because he was always trying to suppress his emotions. But if you go into the  next TV series with data, he was always trying to express his emotions because there you have the  older and the ancient traditional and the modern post-modern approach to emotions and what you're  supposed to do with them. But the Bible says neither.

And here's the reason why. First of all,  think of the athlete. Where is the self-control coming from? Well, he has desires or she has desires  to eat, to sleep, to do these very things, but they're all under control. Why?

Because the athletes  want the prize. They want the crown. But let me ask you a question. Is that mind over emotion? No.

You know why? Because why do you want athletic excellence? Why do you want athletic glory? The desire for athletic glory and athletic excellence is a desire. It's not the conclusion of the logic.

It's a passion of a heart. And what Paul is saying here in using his illustration is that it's not  like, here's the mind and here's the emotions. All these passions are under control because there  is one passion that controls all the rest, that masters and orders all the rest. Because you want  the prize, all the other things are under control. And see, this goes along with biblical psychology.

The Bible does not divide human beings into head and heart, into faculties, like mind and emotions. In fact, if you read the Bible carefully, you'll often be confused because there's many places where  it talks about thinking from the heart. And that's because when the Bible uses the word heart,  it does not mean what we mean in the English language by heart. The heart was the center of  the personality according to the Bible. And it was the place where your fundamental commitments  existed.

It's the metaphor for your fundamental trusts and commitments. And see what you think  and what you feel and what you decide all flow from the heart because whatever you most trust,  whatever you most love, whatever your heart is most passionately trusting and loving in sets the  course for everything else. And if your heart is divided, if your heart is divided and you actually  don't have one single over mastering passion, then your life is going to be out of control. There's going to be all kinds of problems you have. So see, Paul's illustration here on the one  hand critiques the ancient idea of mind over emotions because you see the desire for the prize is not  mind versus eating is an emotion.

Oh no, actually all of our passions are combinations of thinking  and feeling. And freedom and self-control is rightly ordering your loves, rightly ordering your passions,  which is also a critique of the modern approach. Now here's what I mean by that. The modern  approach says, find your feelings and express them. Get in touch with your deepest feelings  and follow them and express them.

Well, that doesn't work. And I'll tell you the reason it doesn't work. If you actually follow your deepest feelings, you'll find that they're also contradictory that you'll  just split up. So let me give you an example. I want to eat chocolate ice cream, not low fat,  no sugar.

I want chocolate ice cream and I also would like to be thinner. And they are both very  strong emotions, very strong emotions. And so, okay, modern man, modern woman, get in touch with  your deep emotions and follow them. I want to eat chocolate ice cream. I want to be thin.

Follow them. You just split because they're at locker heads. Let me give you one that's maybe not  as comical. You want a career? You want a family?

So you want success, but you also want  relationships, one community. And the fact is, if you want to totally be committed to your career  and totally be committed to success and glory, that actually gets in the way of even nurturing a  prospective marriage partner in a relationship. Certainly gets in the way of nurturing an actual  marriage and nurturing your family. And the fact is, you can never be as successful as you would be  if you just forgot about relationships and you can never be as strong in your relationships. If you just go whole hog on your career, these things are at locker heads and you're going to have  to choose.

Often, you're going to have to choose. Now, San Augustan years ago, obviously since he's  been dead a long time, San Augustan once said that sin is disordered love. That's a brilliant  understanding of what the Bible teaches. Sin is disordered love. It's loving things out of order.

So what he says, for example, is if you choose individual glory over friendship,  so even over your family, you're actually going against the way in which God created the world  because relationships is very, very important. If you put your own individual glory first,  instead of serving other people in nurturing community, you're going against the fabric of the  world. And what that means is, there will be breakdown because you're loving secondary things  as if they were primary. And you're loving primary things that they're secondary. You're loving  things out of order.

And if you have disordered love, it leads to breakdown. And so the modern idea  that you just get in touch with your feelings and you just discover them and you get in touch with  them and you express them makes no sense because we have all these contradictory feelings,  you have to decide which are the liberating ones. See, it's more liberating to use the desire to  have good health and to lose weight, to master the need to eat every time you see something. Because in the long run, if you live twice as long, you'll eat a lot more chocolate ice cream  in the end. In other words, which of those two desires should be given the priority?

Which one should  you choose? Which one should you let engage your heart more so that you can control the other one? You have to find the right one. You have to find the one that fits in with your design. In that case, the design of your body.

And so Augustine says, if you rightly order your loves,  you will become increasingly a self-controlled, free person or put it this way. Unlike what the ancient  say, unlike what the modern say, self-control is not a matter of mind over emotions. It's not a  matter of just being in touch with your feelings. It's loving, supreme things, supremely. It's finding those supreme things and letting them engage your heart wholly,  undividedly, and that brings self-control.

Because you can see it. Paul's using an illustration  of an athlete. And he knows it's a limited illustration. I do know certain athletes that have  really pretty much in their physical life because they want the prize, they want the gold medal or  whatever. They actually have their physical life in an enormous order.

You can't pinch an inch. They're perfect about what they eat. They're perfect about how they sleep. They're perfect about  exercise. Perfect.

And yet, of course, because they have this, as Paul says, their goal is a crown  that will not last. They also only, because they have a limited crown, a limited prize,  they only have limited self-control because they might have physical self-control very often  in no offense to those of you who have been athletes or are athletes. You know, you can have your  body under incredible control and your soul be utterly a wreck. You know, destructive perfectionism,  fears, anger, everything. Paul saying, if you love the supreme thing supremely, if you seek the  crown that will last forever, then everything in your life, if you're able to get your heart fully  and supremely rested in that, everything else in your life will start to come together.

Well,  so that leads us to this question. What is that crown that will last forever? What is it? So in other words, how does this self-control really happen in our lives? And the answer is, it's not as simple as you think, because when you read that and you say,  ah, you know, they run for a crown that will not last, but we run for a crown that will last forever,  we say, oh, I know what that means.

It's a heavenly crown. Paul's talking about his salvation  that someday he's going to stand before God and God's going to say, well done, good and faithful  that's what I'm carrying. I want to please God, I want to do his will, I want to be accepted by him,  I want his salvation. Now you think that's what Paul's saying? That that's the prize,  that that's the crown that will last forever?

Uh-uh. Because I mean, if that's what he was saying  that he's working so hard to be a good Christian, he's working so hard to be a good Christian leader,  so someday he knows God will bless him and accept him and save him. If he's saying that,  he's contradicting everything else he said anywhere else in the Bible. Because everywhere Paul's always saying, I am saved in Christ, I am accepted. Salvation is a gift,  it's not something I run for, it's not something I, you know, I work for, so I don't want to be  disqualifies from the prize, you see verse 27, is he saying that if I don't really live a very good  life, I might find in the end that I'm not saved?

No, he couldn't be saying that. Well then what is it? With Christmas just around the corner, we are inviting people to sign up for our Advent  devotional series, which you can receive daily from November 30th to December 24th. The daily  meditations will help you take time to think about the meaning and joy that comes from Christ's birth. Each day of Advent, you'll receive a devotional with a meditation on a Bible passage that focuses on  why Jesus came into the world, to reconcile us to our Heavenly Father.

We believe that during this  short season, this is a great tool to help you focus on the hope, joy, peace, and love we have  through Christ's birth. You can sign up by visiting gospelonlife.com slash Advent. Again, to sign  up, go to gospelonlife.com slash Advent. In addition to the daily emails, you'll also receive a video  message each Sunday. The weekly video message starts each week of Advent with a meditation from  Tim Keller, followed by a brief discussion with Tim and Kathy talking about something they noticed  in the meditation.

It's our prayer that through this Advent series, you experience the hope and joy  that comes from Christ's birth and that it is a source of encouragement to you this Advent season. See, the goal that will give you self-control, by the way, I've been very convicted by this over  the years. This is not what you might think. The goal that brings self-control, the Paul's talking  about, this crown, is not just pleasing God, of course you're going to please God. It's not that  general, it's not that abstract, it's in verse 23.

He says, I do all this for the sake of the gospel,  but I may share in its blessings. Now again, the English, on the surface, even that looks like he's  saying this, I am striving with all my might that someday I might experience the blessings of  salvation in my life. That's not what he's saying. Here's the reason why. First of all, the word share,  there's two aspects of this very complex verb that can't be gotten across with the simple English  translation.

First of all, the word share means share with others, something you already have. So the first thing he's saying is, the great passion of my life is not to get salvation,  I've already got it, but to share the blessings that I'm having. And what Paul is saying is I'm  experiencing some kind of bliss, some kind of joy, some kind of beauty, something in the gospel,  and I don't want to enjoy it alone. I'm more than anything else want to make sure that other  people are enjoying it too, but that's not always talking about. Because this word that can be translated  share can also be translated, participate.

And what he's saying is, I want to participate in the  gospel in such a way that all kinds of other people experience the blessings I'm having in it. What does that mean? And all the commentators are actually in agreement about Paul is trying to say  not simply that he wants to evangelize people, not simply that he's just trying to proclaim the  gospel so you can see a lot of people get converted. That's not what he's saying. Only what he's  actually saying is, I want to so embody the gospel, I want to so participate in the gospel,  I want to so reflect the gospel, I want to so display the gospel in my life that anybody,  anybody at all who looks into my heart into my life will see how the gospel operates,  will see the beauty that I see at it.

And this is an absolutely comprehensive life goal. See, if I really thought of this as mainly that his great goal is just simply to see a lot of  other people become Christians like he is, if that was, if I adopted that as a goal, it wouldn't be  enough to give me self control, you know why? If my goal was to see a lot of people become Christians,  I would work strictly on my rhetorical skills. I would make sure that I totally discipline the  parts of my life I needed to discipline in order to stand up here and do what I'm doing right now  really well. But there's all kinds of other things that I would be free to do, you know,  otherwise there's all, by the way, I have to tell you this, you can definitely be a great performer  and some of you know this.

You can be an incredible performer. You can even be a great Christian  teacher, a great Christian preacher, a great Christian evangelist, while other parts of your  life are falling apart. Because if the goal, if this overarching goal is strictly just that,  it's only to, you know, see people become Christians and all that, that's not the only goal. The  goal is to say, I want anybody who looks deep into my heart to see that the gospel completely  dominates me, that if you want to understand how the gospel works, if you want to understand how  God's salvation works, I'll embody it for you. I'll display it for you.

I'll represent it. I'll  reflect it. And if that is Paul, Paul's telling us, if that is the over mastering unified passion  of your life, it is the supreme passion of your life. It's not just one good thing that you like  to get done among others. If it's the supreme passion of your life, you're going to find it brings  everything else into self-control, under control.

You say, well, how do I even get started with that? Here's how you get started with that. When Paul says in verse 26 and 27, I'm like a runner, see? I  do not run like a man running aimlessly. I beat my body and make it my slave.

By the way, that,  don't be thrown by verse 27. I beat my body. That's not Paul saying the body is bad. He's not  an ascetic here, like the ancient ascetics that really thought the body was bad, the spirit is good,  so they just hurt their body just to become more spiritual. He's not talking like that.

He's working  through the metaphor of the athlete. He is saying that just as an athlete runs until your heart feels  like it's going to give out, runs even though you're in agony, runs and runs. He says, I am  like a runner, spiritually speaking, not physically. Why? Because of this incredible goal.

So when he says that life, and I love that, the idea of life being a race, it's not a santa,  it's not a walk through the woods, life is a race because life is hard, life is challenging. See, your heart constantly feels like it's a breaking. That's another good thing, but I can tell you,  the only time I've ever really run very long distances, I feel like my heart is just going to explode. And frankly, that's life. Your heart's always breaking.

It's hard, so life is like a race. Paul says,  and I'm in the race, but I'm trying to race in such a way that I get my crown. Well, you know what? Paul's not the only person that talks about life for us being a race. In the book of Hebrews, it also says life is like a race, but the book of Hebrews gives us the secret  for how you can run in such a way that you're not disqualified.

Because in Hebrews chapter 12, we read this,  let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles and let us run  with endurance, the race that is marked out for us. How? Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and  finisher of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scored its shame and sat  down at the right hand of the throne of God. See what the book of Hebrews is saying? If you want to  run well, look to Jesus because he ran well.

Jesus was a runner. Jesus left heaven and came to  earth and became a human being, and he ran the race of being a human being, and he ran all the way  to the cross, and he endured, and he never gave up. Even though not only did he feel like his heart  was breaking, but Jesus' heart actually did break, because when they spirit him, out came blood and water. Well, why did he run? For the prize, what was the prize?

The joy that set before him. What was that? What joy did Jesus Christ have to come to earth to win that he didn't already have in heaven? Did he come to earth and he ran for the glory of the Father? Yeah, but he already was living  for the glory of the Father.

I mean, he already had that. Was he trying to love Father? Yes, of course,  when he was on earth, he loved the Father, but he already had that. What prize did he not have  that he could only win if he came to earth and ran the race and went to the cross? What's the answer?

You and me, you were Jesus' crown, you were Jesus' glory,  you were the most precious thing, and when he ran that race, you realized that he was the only  human being that ever ran the race who deserved the crown of life. See, Jesus Christ loved God  with all his heart, soul, strength, and mind, and he loved his neighbors himself just like you and I  are supposed to be living. But you see, none of us love God like we should. None of us love each other,  other people as we should. We're all disqualified.

None of us should get the crown. Jesus is the only  human being who ever ran the race that deserved the crown of life, right? But when he ran that race  perfectly and he got the end of his life, what did he get? Oh, he got a crown. What was it?

Was the crown of thorns? He got a wreath on his head too. But he took the crown of thorns that you and I deserve for the way in which we've run. See,  we were disqualified, but he took the crown of thorns so that when you believe in him, we get the  crown of life that his running of the race earned. You don't consider that beautiful.

You don't  find that astounding. Whenever you see something of incredible beauty, you want other people to see it  and share in its blessings, don't you? When you hear great music, don't you grab your friend and say,  you know, stick your iPod in their careers? Listen to this because you want the person to go, wow,  why? Well, you love your friend, but also your friend's joy in the same beauty completes your joy  in it.

The more he or she enjoys what you found beautiful, the more you enjoy it to. It's just  natural. It's just an impulse. And what Paul is saying is when I see what Jesus did for me, how he ran  the race and he took the crown of thorns and I might have the crown of life. When I realized that I  am his crown, you are his crown.

When I realized he loves us like that, that what? That's beautiful. And that captures my imagination and that captures my heart. There's a place in the book of Psalms  where the Psalmist says, you knight my heart to fear thy name. See, our hearts are divided.

That's  how we don't have self-control. You knight my heart. And this will do it. Looking at the gospel,  looking into the beauty and the love of the gospel and the grace of the gospel until  it just becomes the over mastering passion of your life, that unites your life, unites your heart. And then you've got something that will bring every part of your life into control.

I think I need to, you know, I know that if you stop here without any kind of practical  guidelines, some people say, this is inspiring, but I'm not sure how to get my hands on it around it. At the very, the last three verses there, which I actually called out of chapter 10,  which is a little further down in the text, there's actually three very practical things there that  will help you, I think, see this kind of self-control grow. And here's what those three things are,  the Bible, community, and trouble. The Bible, community, and trouble. Those three things  will press you to look to Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.

And the more you look at him  and the more you love him and the more you see him, the more your life will come under control. What are those three things? First of all, look at verse 11. This is very fast. These things  happen to them as examples and were written down.

Now he's looking, actually he's referring to what  he just talked about in the book of Exodus. He was quoting the book of Exodus and about the wilderness  wanderings of Israel. And he was using this earlier in the chapter to apply to them. And here's  what I conclude. When you see Jesus Christ being tempted.

And what's the temptation? Attemptation is a test of your self-control. Whenever Jesus is attacked by Satan, whenever Jesus is  attacked by the religious leaders, even when Jesus is attacked by his executioners and crucified,  how did he handle every temptation? Scripture. He quoted Scripture.

He knew the Scripture. He was so saturated in the Scripture that whatever happened, it came to mind. And that's the first  practical thing I can tell you for self-control. No matter what your problem with self-control is,  if when you're being tested, the Scripture just comes right to mind. It's an amazing help  because it automatically turns your heart to look to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith.

You need a so-no Scripture, so memorized Scripture, so be saturated in it. That when the test  comes, it comes to mind. And that's the first very, very practical way to have this self-control  grow. Secondly, community. Because verse 12 says, so if you think you are standing firm, be careful  you don't fall.

That's an exhortation. He's telling the Corinthians, you are overconfident. You're overconfident and you're setting yourself up for a fall. What is he doing? He's rebuking them.

He's exhorting them. And I can tell you this, you will never experience growth  in self-control. If you don't open your heart to a few other Christians who can hold you accountable,  who can speak into your life as it were. Hebrews 3-13 exhort one another daily,  lest you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. You've got to have people who can come and talk  to you or you will not grow in self-control.

So Bible, community accountability, but lastly,  look at the last verse, which I already started to read, no temptation has seized you. The tests, they come upon you, difficulties, difficulties, they test your self-control. No temptation has seized you, except which is common to other people. God is faithful,  and he won't let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you're tempted, he will provide  a way out so you can stand up under it.

And all this, you can have a whole sermon on this,  but I can point this out to you. No one grows in self-control unless tests seize you,  difficulties seize you, and you just have to cling to God in his faithfulness to get you through it. Nobody ever really knew where you had problems with self-control unless tests come into your life  that show you you don't have the self-control you thought. And therefore, unless you have difficulties,  difficulties that drive you into the arms of God, and difficulties that drive you into the arms  of your community, your friends, and drive you into the scripture, you're not going to grow in  self-control. But every time these things happen, these tests and trials, you just go to God and say,  Lord Jesus, make by self to me a living bright reality.

Be more real to me than you ever  been before. And he will be. And more and more, you will grow in self-control. Let's pray. Our Father,  we all struggle with self-control.

And actually, our struggles in very many cases  are rather secret. Not all of them. Plenty of us have struggles with self-control that all of our  friends can see. But there's an awful lot of our struggles that we keep pretty secret. And I pray  that you would take the search light of your word, and with the power of your spirit, take these  these words of the scripture into our hearts where we maybe keep things rather dark.

We don't  want to admit our problems. We don't know what to do with them. And I pray that the words of this  text of the Word of God will illuminate our hearts so we know what we should be doing. We pray that you would help us be more accountable to each other. We would cling more to you, that we would deal with these problems because they're hurting us,  and they're hurting, especially, our ability to help other people share in the blessings of the  gospel.

Oh, Lord, help us. Please help us to grow in grace in the knowledge of your Son,  Jesus Christ, and His name we pray. Amen.

### 引言：意志力与超自然改变的区别

圣经说，靠意志力驱动的心与超自然改变的心之间有天壤之别。今天，Tim Keller 正在解读圣灵的果子之一，帮助我们看到从努力做好人到真正从内心改变的意义。

今晚的经文阅读在你的公告第8页，来自哥林多前书9和10。

> “我所做的一切都是为了福音的缘故，以便我可以分享其中的祝福。你们不知道在赛跑中，所有的跑者都在跑，但只有一个能得奖吗？要以得奖的方式跑。参加比赛的人都要严格训练。他们这样做是为了得到一个不会持久的冠冕，但我们这样做是为了得到一个永恒的冠冕。因此，我不像一个漫无目的跑步的人。我不像一个打空气的人。不，我击打我的身体，使它成为我的奴仆，以便在我向别人传道之后，我自己不会因奖赏而被取消资格。”

### 圣经对自我控制的理解

在加拉太书5章22和23节，保罗列出了超自然改变的心的九个特征。这些也被称为圣灵的果子，爱、喜乐、和平、忍耐等等。我们每周都会挑选其中一个进行研究，以便我们可以在自己的生活中看到这些特征的出现。今晚我们来到最后一个。在加拉太书5章22和23节的列表中，它被称为自我控制。

> “参加比赛的人在各方面都要自我控制。”

**自我控制就是自我指挥。** 实际上，它是自由的同义词，因为如果你不自我控制，那么你就失控了。如果你失控了，那么你就是其他力量的奴隶。

### 心灵在自我控制中的角色

保罗使用运动员准备比赛的例子来传达圣经对自我控制的理解。现在我们需要这个，因为我们不在控制之中。我们难以控制我们的舌头。我们难以控制我们的思想。我们难以控制我们的感情，我们的冲动，更不用说我们还可能发展出数以百万计的成瘾，比如饮酒、毒品、性、消费、赌博、饮食失调或愤怒的成瘾。

- **理智压制情感**：古希腊的观点认为身体是坏的，精神是好的。
- **自我发现**：现代观点认为压抑情感是问题所在。

圣经说两者都不是。**自由和自我控制是正确地排列你的爱，正确地排列你的激情。**

### 永恒的冠冕

什么是那永恒的冠冕？那是什么？换句话说，这种自我控制如何真正发生在我们的生活中？答案是，这并不像你想的那么简单。

> “我所做的一切都是为了福音的缘故，以便我可以分享其中的祝福。”

保罗说的是我正在经历某种幸福，某种喜悦，某种美丽，某种福音中的东西，我不想独自享受。

### 增长自我控制的实际步骤

圣经、社区和困难。这三件事会促使你仰望耶稣，我们信心的创始成终者。你越多地仰望他，越多地爱他，越多地看到他，你的生活就越会受到控制。

1. **圣经**：要浸透在圣经中，以便在考验来临时，它会浮现在脑海中。
2. **社区**：向其他基督徒敞开心扉，让他们能对你进行监督。
3. **困难**：驱使你投靠上帝和你的社区的困难。

让我们祷告。我们的父，我们都在与自我控制作斗争。实际上，我们的斗争在许多情况下是相当秘密的。并不是所有的斗争。我们中有很多人有自我控制的问题，所有的朋友都能看到。但我们有很多斗争是我们保密的。我祈求你用你的话语的探照灯，借着你的灵的力量，将这些经文的话语带入我们心中那些我们可能保持黑暗的地方。我们不想承认我们的问题。我们不知道该如何处理它们。我祈求这些经文的话语能照亮我们的心，使我们知道我们应该做什么。我们祈求你帮助我们对彼此更加负责。我们会更加依靠你，我们会处理这些问题，因为它们在伤害我们，尤其是在伤害我们帮助其他人分享福音祝福的能力。哦，主，帮助我们。请帮助我们在你儿子耶稣基督的恩典和知识中成长。奉他的名祷告。阿门。

## Chinese Transcript / 中文

今天，提姆·凯勒正在讲解圣灵的一种果子，帮助我们看见，从“努力做好人”走向“从内心真正改变”意味着什么。今晚的经文在你手册第 8 页，出自哥林多前书 9 章和 10 章。我为了福音的缘故，做这一切，为要与人同得这福音的好处。岂不知在场上赛跑的都跑，但得奖赏的只有一人？你们也当这样跑，好叫你们得着奖赏。

凡较力争胜的，诸事都有节制；他们不过是要得能坏的冠冕，我们却是要得不能坏的冠冕。所以，我奔跑不像没有定向的；我斗拳不像打空气的。不，我是攻克己身，叫身服我，恐怕我传福音给别人，自己反被弃绝了。

这些事都要发生在他们身上，作为鉴戒，并且写在经上，警戒我们这末世的人。所以，自己以为站得稳的，需要谨慎，免得跌倒。你们所遇见的试探，无非是人所能受的。神是信实的，必不叫你们受试探过于所能受的；在受试探的时候，总要给你们开一条出路，叫你们能忍受得住。这是主的话。

在加拉太书 5 章 22–23 节，保罗列出了九种超自然改变之心的特征，也被称为圣灵的果子：仁爱、喜乐、和平、忍耐等等。我们所做的，就是每一周取其中一种来查考，好让这些特质显明在我们自己的生命里。今晚我们来到最后一个。在加拉太书 5 章 22–23 节的名单中，它被称为“节制”。

同一个希腊词也出现在这里。我们的中文或英文译本稍微把它藏起来了，因为第 25 节的翻译说：凡较力争胜的，诸事都有节制。其实这只是译者意译或处理一个短语的方式，原文直译是：“凡在场上较力的，诸事都有节制。”这就是保罗说的。而“节制”这个词，就是他在加拉太书 5 章里用的同一个词。

这个词是“egkrateia”，由“ego”（自我）和“kratos”（掌权、权柄）组成，意思是“自我掌权”。节制就是自我掌权。实际上，这个词也可以说是“自由”的同义词。因为如果你不能自制，那你就是失控；如果你是失控的，你就是某些其他力量的奴隶。所以，自由和自制其实是一件事。

保罗用运动员备战比赛的比喻，来说明圣经对节制的看法。我们需要这个教导，因为我们并不在掌控之中。我们很难控制自己的舌头，很难控制自己的思想，很难控制自己的感受、冲动，更不用说那些我们可以发展出来的成千上万种瘾：喝酒、毒品、性、消费、赌博、饮食失调、怒气之类的上瘾。

如果你稍微反省一点，就不可能在一天结束时不这样回头想：我为什么那样说话？我为什么跟着那个冲动走？我们每个人都有自制的问题。保罗在这里告诉我们他的秘诀。而他是历史上五、六个最有影响力的人之一。

他非常懂得自律、自制。他在这里告诉我们三件事：节制是什么；第二，它如何在你里面被生出来；第三，它如何成长。是什么？如何被生出来？如何成长？首先，它是什么。

这里有一个主导性的比喻。他说：如果你在场上较力——他想到的是泛希腊运动会，比如奥林匹克运动会——你就是奔着一个奖赏，一个冠冕去的。顺便说一下，你注意到他讲“那能坏的冠冕”，因为当时奥运会得胜的人不是拿到奖牌，而是真正得到一个冠冕，是用枝叶编成的花冠、花环，你看过图片的。

它当然会枯萎。你不能把冠冕放在一边，十年以后再拿出来看看。它会腐烂，最后化为尘土。但保罗在这里谈的是运动员的节制。因为如果你要那个奖赏、要那个冠冕，你生命中其他的一切就都得被掌控。

你可能想吃，但你只能吃某些东西；你可能想睡懒觉，但你必须早起训练；你可能想晚上玩得很晚才回家，但你必须早点上床。你生命中的每一件事情都被控制住，好叫你得着那个奖赏。

这就是他用来说明属灵节制的比喻，而它很有启发性。让我给你看两种相对的德行观。第一种是古代的观念，是希腊人的想法，但今天仍然存在：身体是坏的，灵魂是好的。因为希腊人认为，身体是情感的来源，而心灵（理性）是逻辑、理性的来源。所以，所谓德行、所谓节制，就是理智战胜情感。做合乎逻辑、合乎理性的事，控制并压抑你的情绪，因为情绪是你较低的本性。

另一种相对立的德行观，就是我们今天常见的。这种观念不认为“情绪”是问题，不认为“压抑情绪”是药方，反倒认为压抑情绪才是问题。现代的观念说：不要追求节制，要追求自我发现。去接触你的感受，去发掘你的感受，然后把它表达出来。不要让别人告诉你什么对你是对、什么对你是错。你自己去发现你觉得什么是对、你觉得你想做什么，然后就去做。

所以，要接触你的感受，表达你的感受。这就是理想的“德行”状态。顺便说一句，如果你想看这两种相对立的观念的例子，只要去看电视剧《星际迷航》。如果你看老版的《星际迷航》，里面有史波克（Spock），他代表传统观点，他总是在努力压抑自己的情绪；但如果你看后来的《星际迷航：下一代》，里面有机器人 Data，他则一直在努力表达自己的情绪。在那里，你就看见了古老的传统观念，和现代后现代对情绪以及该如何处置情绪的两种态度。但圣经说，两者都不是。

原因是什么？先想想运动员。节制从哪里来？他有想吃、想睡等各样的欲望，可是这一切都被控制住。为什么？因为运动员要的是奖赏、要的是冠冕。但我问你一个问题：这是“理智战胜情感”吗？不是。

你知道为什么吗？因为你为什么想要运动成就、想要运动的荣耀？对运动荣耀、运动卓越的渴望本身就是一种欲望，它不是逻辑推理的结论，而是心中的热情。保罗在这里用这个比喻是在说，这不是“理智在这边、情感在那边”，不是说：所有这些欲望都被压制，因为有一个纯理性的高层在管制它们。不，而是有一个更大的渴望，掌管、组织了所有其他的渴望。因为你想要那个奖赏，其他一切就都被控制住。

这正符合圣经对人的心理学。圣经并不把人分成“头脑”和“心”，好像有不同的“机能”：理性与情感。事实上，如果你细读圣经，常会觉得困惑，因为很多地方谈到“心中的思想”。那是因为圣经用“心”这个字时，不是指现代英语中“heart”这个词的意思。照圣经的理解，“心”是整个人格的中心，是你根本性承诺所在之处。

“心”是你根本信靠、根本委身之所在的隐喻。你所思想的、所感受的、所决定的，都从“心”流出来，因为你最信靠什么、最爱什么，你的心最热切地信赖和爱慕什么，就会为你生命的其他部分定下方向。如果你的心是分裂的，如果你的心是分散的，没有一个统摄一切的至高热情，你的生命就会失控，就会出现各种问题。所以，保罗的比喻一方面批判古代那种“理智战胜情感”的观念，因为你可以看见，对奖赏的渴望本身不是一种“理智”，而是与“吃东西”的欲望一样是一种激情。

事实上，我们所有的激情都是思想和感情交织的结果。自由和节制就是把爱、把激情排到正确的次序里。这也同样批判了现代的观念。我的意思是，现代的观念认为：发现自己的感受，然后把它们表达出来；接触你最深层的感受，跟随它们并表达它们。

但那是行不通的，我告诉你原因。如果你真的去跟随自己最深的感受，你会发现它们彼此矛盾，把你撕裂成两半。举个例子：我想吃巧克力冰淇淋，不是低脂、无糖那种，而是货真价实的巧克力冰淇淋；同时，我也想变瘦。这两个都是非常强烈的情绪，非常强烈的欲望。

那么，好吧，现代人，去接触你内心深处的感受，然后跟随它们。我想吃巧克力冰淇淋，我想变瘦——那就跟随吧。结果呢？你就裂成两半，因为这两个欲望正面冲突。再给你一个例子，没那么好笑。你想要事业，也想要家庭。你想要成功，也想要关系、想要群体。

而事实上，如果你要“完全”投入你的事业、完全投入成功和荣耀，这实际上会妨碍你去培育一段预备进入婚姻的关系，更会妨碍你去经营真实的婚姻、经营你的家庭。事实上，你永远不可能在事业上达到你“只顾事业、不顾任何关系”时能达到的高度；同样，你也永远不会在关系上达到你“完全撇下事业只顾家庭”时能达到的深度。这两者是冲突的，很多时候你必须做出取舍。

圣奥古斯丁很久以前——显然，他已经去世很久了——他说过一句话：罪就是错位的爱（disordered love）。这是对圣经教导极有洞见的理解。罪就是爱错了次序。他举的例子是：如果你选择个人荣耀而不是友谊、甚至家人，这就违背了神造世界的秩序，因为关系在神的创造中极其重要。如果你把自己的个人荣耀放在首位，而不是服事别人、培育群体，那就是逆着世界的结构而行。

这意味着，会发生破碎，因为你把次要的东西当作首要来爱，把首要的东西当作次要来爱；你爱的次序错乱了。错位的爱会带来破碎。所以，现代的想法——只要去接触你的感受、发现你的感受，然后表达出来——是说不通的。因为我们有那么多互相矛盾的感受，你必须决定哪一种是“真正让你得自由”的那一种。

更能带来自由的，是运用“想要健康、想要减重”的欲望，去掌管“每次看到食物就想吃”的欲望。因为从长远看，如果你活得更长，你最终能吃到的巧克力冰淇淋会更多。换句话说，这两个欲望中，哪个应该优先？你应该选择哪个？你应该让哪一个更深地抓住你的心，好让你能控制另一个？你必须找到那个正确的欲望，那与“你的设计”相合——在这个例子中，是与你身体的设计相合。

因此，奥古斯丁说，如果你把你的爱排在正确的次序里，你就会越来越成为一个自制、自由的人。或者换一种说法：不像古人，也不像现代人所说的那样，节制不是“理智战胜情感”，也不是“完全活在、顺着自己的感受里”。节制是“至高之物被至高地爱”。是找到那些至高的事物，让它们全然地、无分割地抓住你的心，这就带来自制。

你可以看到这一点。保罗用的是运动员的比喻，他自己也知道这个比喻有局限。我确实认识一些运动员，他们在身体方面，几乎因为渴望达到那个奖赏、那个金牌，而活得井井有条。

你掐不出一寸赘肉。他们对吃什么、睡眠如何、锻炼如何都近乎完美。然而，因为他们追求的——保罗说——不过是一个“能坏的冠冕”，所以他们的节制也是有限的。他们可能在身体上有极强的节制，但在灵魂上却一团糟。毁灭性的完美主义、恐惧、愤怒，各种问题。保罗说，如果你至高地爱那真正至高的东西，如果你追求的是那个“不能坏的冠冕”，而且你的心真正在那上面得着完全、至高的安息，那么你生命中其他的一切都会开始归位，开始被掌控。

接着就引出一个问题：那“不能坏的冠冕”是什么？到底是什么？换句话说，这样的节制究竟如何在我们生命中发生？答案并不像你想的那么简单。因为当你读到这段话：“他们不过是要得能坏的冠冕，我们却是要得不能坏的冠冕”，你会说：哦，我知道这是什么意思。

那是天上的冠冕。保罗在讲他的救恩：有一天他要站在神面前，听见神说：“好，你这又良善又忠心的仆人。”这就是我追求的冠冕。我想讨神喜悦，想行祂的旨意，想被祂接纳，想得着祂的救恩。你会以为保罗是在说：这就是奖赏，这就是那“不能坏的冠冕”。

不是。如果他的意思是：我努力做一个好基督徒，努力做一个好的基督徒领袖，好叫有一天神祝福我、接纳我、拯救我；如果他是在说这个，那他就与自己在圣经别处说的一切话自相矛盾。因为保罗在别处总是说：我在基督里已经得救、已经被接纳。救恩是礼物，不是我去赛跑、去做工、免得被弃绝、免得得不着奖赏的东西。你看 27 节，他说“恐怕我传福音给别人，自己反被弃绝”，难道他是在说：如果我活得不够好，最后可能发现自己并没有得救吗？

不，他不可能是这个意思。那么，他是什么意思？

我们祈求，这个将临期系列能让你经历因基督降生而来的盼望与喜乐，也成为这个将临期对你的一份鼓励。

你看，能带来自制的那个目标——顺便说一句，多年来这段话对我很有责备——不是你可能想象到的那样。保罗说的，那带来自制的目标、那冠冕，不只是“讨神喜悦”。当然，你会讨神喜悦，但不只是这么笼统、不只是这么抽象。答案在第 23 节：

“凡我所行的，都是为福音的缘故，为要与人同得这福音的好处。”

注意，英文里的“与人同得”这个词，在原文里有两个层面的意思，是一个复杂动词，光用一个简单翻译很难把意思表达完整。第一，它的意思是“与别人分享你已经拥有的东西”。所以，保罗首先是在说：我人生最大的热情不是为了得到救恩，我已经得到了；而是为了把我正经历的这些福分分享出去。保罗是在说：我正在福音里经历某种喜乐、某种美好、某种荣美，我不愿意独享。我最想要的是看见别人也同样享受。

但他还不只是说这个。因为这个可以译作“与人同得”的词，也可以译作“参与、分享其中”。他是在说：我要以一种方式来“参与”福音，使得许多人能经历我在其中经历的那些福分。这是什么意思？所有注释家其实在这一点上看法一致：保罗所要的，不仅仅是去传福音、使人悔改信主。他不是只是在说：我要宣讲福音，好让许多人信主而得救。不是。

他真正是在说：我想要如此地体现福音，如此地参与福音，如此地在我生命中反映福音、展现福音，以至于任何人，只要稍微往我内心、往我生命里看，就会看见福音是如何运行的，看见我在福音里所看见的那种美好。这是一个全方位的人生目标。

如果我仅仅认为，他的最大目标只是“看见很多人像他一样成为基督徒”，如果我把这当作目标，那并不足以给我带来自制。你知道为什么？如果我的目标只是：看见许多人信主，我会集中操练我的表达能力。我会确保自己把生命中所有需要操练的部分都操练好，好让我现在站在这里、像现在这样讲道讲得很有说服力。但除此之外，我还有很多其他方面可以为所欲为。

顺便说一句，我得告诉你们这一点：你完全可以成为一个极其出色的“表演者”，你们当中有些人知道这一点。你可以成为非常厉害的表演者，甚至可以是极有恩赐的基督教教师、传道人、布道家，但你生命的其他部分仍然在崩坏。因为如果你的人生总目标只是那一件事——例如，只是要“让人信主”——那还不够。保罗的目标是说：我要让任何深入观察我心、观察我生命的人，都能看见福音完全掌管了我。如果你想知道福音如何运行、神的救恩如何运行，我可以为你具现出来，我可以为你呈现、反映出来。

若这是统摄你生命的一切、统一你所有热情的那个最高目标——它不是你众多愿望当中的一个，而是至高的那一个——你就会发现，它会把你生命中其他一切都带入节制之中，被掌控之中。

你会说：那我怎么开始？

要这样开始：当保罗在第 26–27 节说：“我就是这样奔跑，不像没有定向的；我就是这样斗拳，不像打空气的。不，我是攻克己身，叫身服我……”——顺带说一下，不要被第 27 节这句话“攻克己身”绊住。保罗不是在说身体是坏的。他不是像那些古代苦修派那样，相信身体是坏的、灵魂是好的，所以折磨自己的身体来变得更属灵。他不是这个意思。

他是在沿用运动员的比喻在说话：就好像运动员要跑到心脏快要承受不住、跑到浑身疼痛，仍然不停地跑。保罗是在说，从属灵意义上讲，我就是这样的一个赛跑者，不是从肉身意义上。为什么？因为有这样的至高目标。

所以，当他说人生是赛跑——我很喜欢这个比喻——人生不是郊游，不是悠闲地在树林散步，人生是赛跑，因为人生艰难，充满挑战。你的心不断觉得快要碎掉。这其实是个好比喻：我唯一几次跑长距离的时候，都觉得心脏快要炸开了。老实说，这就是人生——你的心常常在破碎。人生艰难，所以人生像一场赛跑。保罗说，我也在跑，但我要以一种方式来跑，好叫我得着那冠冕。

你知道吗？谈到人生是赛跑的，不只保罗一个人。希伯来书也说，人生像一场赛跑，不过希伯来书告诉了我们一个秘诀，教我们如何跑，才不会被弃绝。

在希伯来书 12 章我们读到：“我们既有这许多的见证人，如同云彩围着我们，就当放下各样的重担，脱去容易缠累我们的罪，以忍耐奔那摆在我们前头的路程。那怎么样呢？‘仰望为我们信心创始成终的耶稣；他因那摆在前面的喜乐，就轻看羞辱，忍受了十字架的苦难，便坐在神宝座的右边。’”

你看，希伯来书在说什么？如果你想跑得好，就仰望耶稣，因为他跑得好。耶稣是一位赛跑者。耶稣离开天上，来到地上，成为人，跑完了作人这条路，一直跑到十字架前。他忍受到底，从未放弃。祂不仅觉得心快要碎了，祂的心事实上真的碎了。因为当士兵用枪扎祂的时候，血与水流出来。

那么，他为什么要跑？为了那奖赏。那“摆在前面的喜乐”是什么？耶稣为了赢得什么喜乐，才需要来到地上？在天上他没有吗？他是为了天父的荣耀吗？是的，但他在天上已经为父的荣耀而活了。他已经有这份荣耀了。他来地上是否是为了爱父？是的，但他原本就爱父。

那他到底是为了什么奖赏来？是什么冠冕，是他非得来到地上、跑完这场赛程、走上十字架才得得到的？答案是什么？就是你和我。你是耶稣的冠冕，你是他的荣耀，你是他最宝贵的产业。当他跑完那场赛跑时，你要明白，他是历史上唯一一位真正配得生命冠冕的人。

耶稣基督尽心、尽性、尽意、尽力爱神，也如同我们应当那样爱人如己。但你看，我们没有一个人像我们应该的那样爱神，也没有一个人像我们应该的那样爱人。我们都被淘汰了，都不配得冠冕。耶稣是唯一一个跑完赛程、配得生命冠冕的人，对吗？

但当他完美地跑完这条路，到了生命的终点，他得到了什么？哦，他也得了一顶冠冕。是什么冠冕？是一顶荆棘冠冕。他头上同样戴上了一个花冠。但他戴上的是我们应该受的那顶荆棘冠冕，因为我们跑得一塌糊涂。我们本该被弃绝，但他戴上荆棘冠冕，好叫我们信他的时候，得着他跑那场赛程所赢得的生命的冠冕。

你若不觉得这件事美，若看不见它是何等惊人……你知道吗？每当你看见某样极其美的事物，你就很自然地想要其他人也看见、也共享那份美，不是吗？当你听到一段动人的音乐，不是会抓过朋友来，把你的耳机塞给他，说：听这个，听这个！你希望那个人也说：哇！为什么？当然，出于你爱朋友；但同时也是因为，当你的朋友在那美之中所得到的喜悦，也成全了你自己的喜悦。他越是享受那你所觉得美好的东西，你自己在其中的喜乐也越大。

这是自然的冲动。保罗在说，当我看见耶稣为我所做的一切——他如何跑完那场赛程，戴上荆棘冠冕，好叫我得着生命的冠冕——当我意识到：我是他的冠冕，你是他的冠冕，当我意识到他如此地爱我们，这就……这就太美了。这抓住了我的想像力，抓住了我的心。

诗篇有一句话说：“求你使我专心敬畏你的名。”我们的心是分裂的，这就是为什么我们没有自制。“求你使我专心”——把我分裂的心重新联合起来。而福音的美、主恩的爱和恩典，就能做到这一点。当你不断凝视福音，直到它真正成为你生命中统摄一切的最高热情，直到它联合了你的生命、联合了你的心，你才能拥有一种能把你生命各个部分都带入秩序中的力量。

我想我需要在这里稍微停一下。我知道，如果现在就停，不给一些具体的指引，有些人会说：这很振奋人心，但我不知道怎样实际地抓住它。最后那三节经文——其实我刚才是从第 10 章再往下摘出来的——里有三个非常实际的要素，能帮助你看见这样的节制如何成长。我把它们概括为：圣经、群体和苦难。圣经、群体和苦难。这三样会催逼你去仰望耶稣这信心创始成终者。你越是仰望他、越爱他、越看见他，你的生命就越受掌控，越有节制。

这三样是什么？第一，看第 11 节，我会很快讲过去：“这些事都要发生在他们身上，作为鉴戒，并且写在经上……”他在讲什么？其实他在指前面刚刚引用的出埃及记，讲以色列人在旷野漂流的事。他在用那些事来应用在哥林多信徒身上。这里我要得出一个结论：当你看见耶稣受试探——试探是什么？试探就是对你节制的考验。

每当耶稣受到撒但攻击、受到宗教领袖攻击，甚至被行刑的人攻击、钉在十字架上时，他是如何面对每个试探的？用经文。他引用圣经。他那么熟悉圣经，圣经那么渗透他的心思，以至于不论发生什么，都会立刻浮现出来。这是我能给你的第一个关于节制的非常实际的建议：不论你在哪个方面缺乏自制，只要在你受试探时，圣经能立刻跳出来，就会带来极大的帮助，因为它会一下子把你的心转向耶稣——信心的创始成终者。

你需要如此认识圣经，如此背诵经文，如此被经文浸透，以至于当试探临到时，它就自然浮现在脑海里。这是让节制成长的第一个非常实际的方法。第二是群体。第 12 节说：“所以自己以为站得稳的，需要谨慎，免得跌倒。”这是一个劝诫。他在对哥林多信徒说：你们自信过头了，你们正把自己摆在跌倒的位置上。他在做什么？他在责备他们、劝戒他们。

我要告诉你的是，如果你不向几个基督徒敞开心，让他们可以监督你、可以对你说真话，你就永远不会在节制上成长。希伯来书 3 章 13 节说：“总要彼此劝勉，免得你们中间有人被罪迷惑，心里就刚硬了。”你必须有一些人可以来到你面前，对你说话，否则你不会在节制上成长。所以是圣经，是群体中的彼此督责。

但最后，看最后这一节——我之前已经开始读了：“你们所遇见的试探，无非是人所能受的……”那些试炼临到你，是困难，是逼迫，是对你节制的考验。“神是信实的，必不叫你们受试探过于所能受的；在受试探的时候，总要给你们开一条出路，叫你们能忍受得住。”关于这节经文，可以整篇讲一篇道，但我至少要指出这一点：如果没有那些临到你的试炼、困难来抓住你、压在你身上，迫使你紧紧抓住神的信实，你就不会在节制上成长。

除非有试炼临到你的人生，让你看见自己在节制上的问题——你并没有你以为的那种自制——否则你不会真正知道自己哪里缺乏节制。所以，除非有困难临到你，把你逼进神的怀中，把你逼到群体、朋友的怀中，把你逼到圣经里面，你不会在节制上成长。可是，每一次这些试炼、艰难临到，你若就来到神面前说：“主耶稣啊，求你使你自己在我心里成为活生生的真实；比以往任何时候都更真实。”他就会这样做。而且，越来越多地，你会在节制上成长。

让我们祷告。

天父，我们每一个人都在节制上有挣扎。事实上，我们许多挣扎在相当大的程度上是隐秘的——当然，不是所有的挣扎。有不少人所经历的节制问题，是所有朋友都看得见的。但也有很多挣扎，我们藏得相当深。我祈求你借着你话语的探照灯、借着圣灵的大能，把这些经文带进我们心里那些我们刻意保持黑暗的角落里。

在那些地方，我们不愿承认自己的问题，也不知道如何是好。我祈求你，让这段经文——神的话——光照我们的心，使我们知道自己该怎样行。我们祈求，你帮助我们更多向彼此敞开，更多彼此负责；帮助我们更紧紧抓住你，认真处理这些问题，因为它们在伤害我们，更在伤害我们把福音的福分与别人分享的能力。

哦主，求你帮助我们，在恩典和对你儿子耶稣基督的认识上长进。奉他的名祷告，阿们。

今天，提姆·凯勒要来展开讲解圣灵果子中的一个，让我们看见，真正的改变是如何从内在发生，而不仅仅是努力做一个好人。今晚的经文在你们的周报第 8 页，出自哥林多前书第 9 章和第 10 章。我为福音的一切缘故这样行，为要与人同得这福音的好处。岂不知在场上赛跑的都跑，但得奖赏的只有一个；你们也当这样跑，好叫你们得着奖赏。

凡较力争胜的，诸事都有节制。他们不过是要得能坏的冠冕，我们却是要得不能坏的冠冕。所以，我奔跑不像无定向的；我斗拳不像打空气的。我是攻克己身，叫身服我，恐怕我传福音给别人，自己反被弃绝了。

这些事都要作为我们的鉴戒，已经记载下来，警戒我们这末世的人。所以，自己以为站得稳的，需要谨慎，免得跌倒。你们所遇见的试探，无非是人所能受的；神是信实的，必不叫你们受试探过于所能受的；在受试探的时候，总要给你们开一条出路，叫你们能忍受得住。这是主的话。

在加拉太书五章二十二到二十三节，保罗列出了一个被超自然改变的心所具有的九种特质，也就是所谓圣灵的果子——仁爱、喜乐、和平、忍耐等等。我们一直在做的，就是每一周挑出其中一个来思想，好让这些特质在我们自己的生命中显明出来。今晚我们来到最后一个。在加拉太书五章二十二到二十三节的名单中，它被称作“节制”。

同一个希腊词也出现在这里，只是被我们的译文稍微遮掩了，因为译文在第 25 节说：“凡较力争胜的，诸事都有节制。”事实上，这是译者对一个短语的意译或表达；按字面来说，就是“凡在场上争胜的，凡事都要有节制”。这正是保罗所说的。而“节制”这个词，正是他在加拉太书第五章所用的同一个词。

这个词是“ego crottia”，意思是自我、自我，“self-crottia”，就是“命令自己”。Self-control（自制）就是自我命令、自我掌控。事实上，它是“自由”的同义词，因为如果你不能自制，那你就是失控的；如果你失控，你就成了其他力量的奴隶。所以，得自由和能自制其实是一回事。

保罗用运动员备战比赛、参加比赛的比喻，来说明圣经对自制的理解。我们需要听这个，因为我们并不在掌控之中。我们很难控制自己的舌头，很难控制自己的思想，很难控制自己的情绪、冲动，更不用说我们还能染上的千千万万种瘾，比如喝酒、吸毒、性、消费、赌博、饮食失调，或者怒火成瘾之类的。

如果你想要谨慎持重，就不可能在一天结束时不回头看一看，说：“我为什么要那样说？我为什么要跟着那个冲动走？”我们都有自制方面的问题。而保罗把他的秘诀告诉我们。他是有史以来五六个最有影响力的人物之一。

他非常懂得自律、自制。他在这里告诉我们：第一，自制是什么；第二，它如何在你里面被生出来；第三，它如何成长。它是什么？它怎样被生出来？它怎样长大？首先，它是什么。

这里有一个核心的比喻。他说：“若有人在运动场上比赛”，他想到的是泛希腊运动会，比如奥林匹克运动会。

你是奔着一个奖品——一个冠冕——去的。顺便说一句，你注意到他讲到“不能存留的冠冕”。因为那时候在奥运会上，你拿到的不是奖牌，而是一个真正的冠冕，是个花环，是个桂冠，你知道的，你见过那样的画。

而它当然会枯萎。你不能把冠冕搁在一边，十年以后拿出来再看看，它实实在在会腐烂成灰。但保罗谈的是运动员所具有的那种自制。因为如果你想要那个奖品，如果你想要那个冠冕，那你生命中其他的一切就都得被纳入掌控之下。

你可能很想吃东西，但是你……

只能吃某些东西。你可能想要睡懒觉，但你必须起床去锻炼。你可能想要在外面待到很晚，但你得早点上床睡觉。你知道，你生命里的每一件事都被管控住了。这样你才能得到奖赏。

现在，他用的这个例子是为了谈属灵的自制，这一点很有意思。因为让我给你两个关于“美德”的替代思路。第一个是古代的思路，这是希腊人的想法，但今天仍然存在：身体是坏的，灵是好的。因为在希腊人看来，身体是情感的来源。

而心智则是逻辑和理性的来源。因此，在那样的观念里，美德——也就是自制——被视为“理智战胜情感”。做合乎逻辑、合乎理性的事，控制、压抑你的情绪，因为你的情绪属于你较低下的本性。

第二个关于美德的思路，就是我们今天所持有的。意思是说，那种古老的思路今天还在，但我们又多了一种新的思路，这种思路不把情绪看作问题所在，也不把压抑情绪看作解决之道。

相反，它把压抑情绪本身视为问题。你看，现代的观念说：“不要自制，要自我发现。”跟你的感受连上线，找到你的感受，然后把它们表达出来。不要让别人告诉你对或错是什么。你要自己找到你觉得什么是对、什么是错，你觉得你想做什么，然后你就去做。

所以，跟你的感受连上线，表达你的感受。这才是理想中的“有德行的人”。

顺便说一句，如果你想要这两种彼此竞争的思路的例子，只要去看电视上的《星际迷航》就行了。如果你看最早的那一版，有史波克（Spock），那里呈现的就是传统的思路，因为他总是在试图压抑自己的情感。但如果你看后面的电视剧系列，有机器人数据（Data），他却总是在努力表达自己的情感。在那儿你就看见了古老、传统的那一套，以及现代、后现代对于情绪及其处理方式的思路，摆在一块儿对照。

不过，圣经说，这两种都不是。

原因在这里。首先，想想运动员。自制是从哪里来的呢？嗯，他有——

她有吃、睡以及做这些事情的欲望，但这一切都在掌控之下。为什么？

因为运动员想要奖赏，他们想要那顶桂冠。但我问你一个问题：这是“理智战胜情感”吗？并不是。

你知道为什么吗？因为你为什么会渴望卓越的运动表现？你为什么会渴望运动的荣耀？对运动荣耀、运动卓越的渴望本身就是一种欲望，它不是某种逻辑推论的结论。

它是内心的热情。而保罗在这里用这个例子要说明的，就是这并不是说：这边是理智，那边是情感，所有这些激情都被压在底下、被管控住。不是这样的，而是有一个至高的激情在掌管、安排所有其他的激情。因为你想要那份奖赏，其他一切就都能被控制住。你看，这其实与圣经的“心理学”是一致的。

圣经并没有把人分成“头脑”和“心”，也没有把人拆成“理智”和“情感”这类机能。事实上，如果你仔细读圣经，常常会有点困惑，因为很多地方都在说“心里思想”。那是因为当圣经使用“心”这个词时，指的并不是我们英文里所说的“heart（心）”。按圣经的理解，心是整个人格的中心，是你最根本承诺所在的地方。

它是你根本信靠与承诺的隐喻。你所思所想、你所感觉、你所决定的一切都从“心”流出来，因为无论你最信靠什么、最爱什么，你的心最热切地信靠和爱慕的那一样东西，都会为你生命中其他的一切定下方向。如果你的心是分裂的，如果你的心是分裂的，没有一个至高、统一、压倒性的激情来统摄一切，那你的生命就会失控，你就会遇到各种各样的问题。所以，你看，保罗的这个例子一方面是在批判古代那种“理智压倒情感”的想法，因为你看，对奖赏的渴望并不是“理智对抗吃东西的情感”。

哦不，其实我们所有的激情都是思想与感受的结合。而自由与自制，就是把你的各种爱有次序地摆放好，正确地安排你的诸般爱。

情感，这同样也是对现代方法的一种批判。我的意思是这样的：现代的方法说，要发现你的感受并表达它们。要与自己最深处的感受连结，然后跟随它们、表达它们。

然而，这行不通。我来告诉你为什么行不通。如果你真的去跟随自己最深的感受，你会发现它们彼此之间也是互相矛盾的，结果你会整个人被撕裂。让我举个例子。我想吃巧克力冰淇淋，而不是低脂、无糖的那种。

我想吃巧克力冰淇淋，同时我也想变瘦。而这两种都是非常强烈的情感，非常强烈的情感。所以，好吧，现代人啊，现代的男人女人啊，去贴近你内心深处的情感，然后跟着它们走。我想吃巧克力冰淇淋，我想变瘦。

跟着它们走，你就会被撕裂，因为它们彼此冲突。让我再给你一个也许没那么滑稽的例子。你想要事业？你也想要家庭？

所以你想要成功，但你也想要关系，想要群体。而事实是，如果你想要完全投入你的事业、完全追求成功与荣耀，这实际上会妨碍你去培育一段潜在的婚姻关系。更不用说妨碍你经营一段真实的婚姻，和养育你的家庭。事实上，如果你只顾着把人际关系抛在脑后，你的成功永远可以比现在再更上一层楼；而如果你只是一股脑儿扑在事业上，你的人际关系永远也不会那么稳固。这些东西彼此冲突，你必须做出选择。

很多时候，你必须做出选择。现在，很多年前的奥古斯丁——当然他已经去世很久了——奥古斯丁曾经说过，罪就是紊乱的爱（disordered love）。这是对圣经教导一个极其精辟的理解。罪就是紊乱的爱，就是把爱的次序搞乱了。

比如他说，如果你选择个人的荣耀胜过友谊，甚至胜过你的家庭，你实际上就是在违背上帝创造世界的方式，因为关系是极其重要的。如果你把自己的个人荣耀放在首位，而不是服侍别人、培育群体，那么你就……

这就意味着，你是在违背世界的结构而活。意思就是，必然会出现崩坏，因为你把次要的东西当成主要的来爱，而把主要的东西当成次要的来爱。你在错误的次序里去爱那些东西。

如果你的爱是无序的，就一定会带来崩坏。所以，那种现代观念——只要与自己的感受连结、发现自己的感受、与之同在并把它们表达出来——其实说不通，因为我们里面有各种彼此矛盾的感受，你必须决定哪一些才是真正让你得释放的。你看，运用“想要有好健康、想减肥”的欲望，去制伏“每次看到什么吃的就要吃”的冲动，会更让你得自由。因为从长远来看，如果你能多活一倍的寿命，最后你其实会吃到更多的巧克力冰淇淋。换句话说，这两个欲望当中，到底哪一个应该被优先？

你该选哪一个？你该让哪一个更抓住你的心，好让你能控制另一个？你必须找到那个正确的欲望，那个符合你受造设计的欲望——在这个例子里，就是你身体的设计。

所以，奥古斯丁说，如果你把你的爱摆在正确的次序上，你就会越来越成为一个有节制、自由的人。或者这样说：与古人的想法不同，也与今人的想法不同，自制并不是“理性压过情感”，也不是“只是好好感受你的情绪”。自制是“至高的事要被至高地爱”。是找到那些至高的事物，让它们完全、毫无分裂地抓住你的心，而这就带来自制。

你从保罗用的例子里可以看见这一点——他用的是运动员的比喻。他也知道这是一个有限的比喻。我确实认识某些运动员，因为他们想要奖牌、想要金牌或之类的东西，所以至少在他们的身体生活上，的确把一切安排得井井有条。

你在他们身上捏不到一寸赘肉。他们对自己吃什么极其讲究，对睡眠极其讲究，对锻炼极其讲究，一切都近乎完美。

然而，当然了，因为他们——正如保罗所说——他们的目标是一个“不能长存的冠冕”，所以他们也只会——因为

他们只有有限的冠冕、有限的奖赏，他们也只有有限的自制力。因为他们也许在身体上有很强的自律，但常常——无意冒犯在座曾经是或现在是运动员的各位——你可以把身体控制得无比出色，却让灵魂变得一团糟。你知道的，毁灭性的完美主义、恐惧、愤怒等等。保罗是在说：如果你以至高的方式去爱那至高的事物，如果你追求的是那永不朽坏的冠冕，那么你生命中的一切——如果你的心能完全、且至高地安息在那上面——你生命中其他的一切都会开始整合起来、有条有理。

那么，这就带出一个问题：那将存到永远的冠冕究竟是什么？它是什么呢？换句话说，这种自制在我们生命中究竟是如何真正发生的？答案是：事情并不像你想的那么简单。因为当你读到这里，就会说：啊，他们是为不能长存的冠冕而跑，但我们却是为那永远长存的冠冕而跑。我们会说：哦，我知道那是什么意思了。

那是天上的冠冕。保罗是在说他的得救，将来有一天他会站在神面前，神会说：做得好，你这又良善又忠心的仆人……这就是我所追求的。我想要讨神喜悦，我想行他的旨意，我想被他接纳，我想要他的救恩。你会以为保罗是在说：那就是奖赏，那就是那永远长存的冠冕吗？

不是。因为如果他真是在说：他如此努力做一个好基督徒，如此努力做一个好的基督徒领袖，好叫有一天神会赐福他、接纳他、拯救他——如果他是这个意思，那他就在否定他在圣经其他地方所说的一切。因为在其他地方保罗总是说：我在基督里已经得救，我已经被接纳。救恩是礼物，不是我去奔跑换来的，不是我靠努力得来的。那么我不想被废弃、失去那奖赏，你看第27节，他是不是在说：如果我现在不活出一个相当好的人生，到了最后就可能发现自己并没有得救？

不，他不可能是这个意思。那么，那到底是什么呢？圣诞节就要到了，我们正在邀请……

邀请人们报名参加我们的将临期灵修系列。这个系列从 11 月 30 日到 12 月 24 日，每天都会发送给你。当中的每日默想将帮助你停下脚步，思想基督降生所带来的意义与喜乐。在将临期的每一天，你都会收到一篇灵修文章，其中有一段圣经经文的默想，聚焦于耶稣为何来到世上——要使我们与天父和好。

我们的祷告是，透过这个将临期系列，你能经历基督降生所带来的盼望与喜乐，并且在这个将临期中，它能成为鼓励你的泉源。你看，能够给你带来自制力的那个目标——顺便说一句，多年来这点一直深深地光照我——并不是你想象的那样。保罗所说的、能带来自制力的那个目标，也就是这顶冠冕，不只是讨神喜悦，当然你会讨神喜悦，但这并不是那么笼统、那么抽象。真正的答案在第 23 节。

他说：我所行的，都是为福音的缘故，为要与人同得这福音的好处。现在，再一次，按英文表面看起来，他似乎在说：我正竭尽全力，好让有一天我也能在自己生命中经历救恩的福分。但他并不是这个意思。原因如下。首先，“同得”这个词是一个非常复杂的动词，有两个层面，用简单的英文翻译是无法完全表达出来的。

首先，“同得”意味着把你已经拥有的东西与别人一起分享。所以他首先在说的是，我人生最大的热情，不是去得到救恩——我已经得着了——而是去分享我所享受的这些福分。而保罗正在做的，是

他说的是，我正在经历某种福乐、某种喜乐、某种美好，是在福音里的一种东西，而我不想只自己享受。我最渴望的是确保别人也能享受到同样的东西，但他在这里说的并不总是“传讲”这个意思。因为这个可以译作“分享”的词，也可以译作“参与”。

他在说的是：我想以一种这样的方式来参与福音，使得各种各样的其他人都能经历我在其中所拥有的那些祝福。这是什么意思呢？所有注释家其实都一致认为，保罗在这里要表达的，不只是他想去传福音，不只是他要宣讲福音，好让许多人信主、归正。这不是他所说的全部。他真正的意思是：我想如此地“活出”福音，我想如此地参与在福音中，我想如此地反映福音，我想在我的生命中如此地彰显福音，以至于任何人，任何一个人，只要往我的内心、我的生活里看，就会看到福音是怎样运作的，就会看到我在福音里所看见的那种美丽。

而这其实是一个绝对全面的人生目标。你看，如果我真的认为，他的主要目标就是看见许多人像他一样成为基督徒，如果我把那当作自己的人生大目标，那也不足以让我有自制力，你知道为什么吗？如果我的目标只是看到许多人成为基督徒，我就会专注地去雕琢我的表达能力。我会确保自己严格操练生命中那些必须操练的部分，好让我能站在这里，把我现在正在做的事做得非常好。但除此以外，还有许许多多别的事情，是我仍然可以随意去做的。顺便说一下，我得告诉你这一点：你完全可能成为一个很厉害的“表演者”，你们当中有些人也知道这一点。

你可以是一个非常了不起的表演者，你甚至可以是一个很棒的基督徒教师、很好的基督徒传道人、很有效的基督徒布道家，同时，你生命的其他部分却在分崩离析。因为如果你的目标——那个至高无上的人生目标——只是那样，仅仅是要看见人变成基督徒，那么一切就会变成这样。

但是，那并不是唯一的目标。真正的目标是：我要任何一个深入我内心的人，都能看到福音完全主宰了我；如果你想明白福音是怎样运行的，如果你想明白上帝的救恩是怎样工作的——我会为你具象化它，我会为你呈现出来。

我会代表它，我会反映它。如果对保罗来说是这样，保罗就在告诉我们：如果这是你生命当中压倒一切、统一一切的热情，如果这是你至高无上的热情，它不是众多你想完成的好事当中的一件而已，而是你生命中最首要的热情，那么你会发现，它会让生命中其他的一切都进入节制、归于有序。

你会说，那我怎么开始？要怎么开始呢？保罗在第 26、27 节说：我就像一个赛跑的人，你看，“我奔跑不像无定向的，我斗拳不像打空气的。我是攻克己身，叫身服我。”

顺便说一下，不要被第 27 节绊住：“我攻克己身。”这不是在说身体是坏的。保罗不是一个禁欲主义者，不像那些古代的苦修者，以为身体是坏的、灵魂是好的，所以就不断折磨身体，好叫自己更属灵。他不是在那样说。

他是在沿用运动员的比喻。他是在说，就像一个运动员一直跑到心脏仿佛要支撑不住，虽然浑身痛苦仍然继续奔跑，一直跑、一直跑。他说，我在属灵的意义上就像这样一个赛跑的人，不是在肉身上，为什么？因为有这个极其了不起的目标。

所以，当他说生命——我很喜欢这个——生命是一场赛跑的时候，他是在说：生命不是散步，不是林间漫步；生命是一场赛跑，因为生命是艰难的，生命是充满挑战的。你的心几乎一直觉得快要碎了。这是另一件值得注意的事，但就我个人而言，每一次我真的去跑很长的距离时，我都觉得自己的心快要爆炸了。而事实上，这就是人生：你的心总是在破碎。

生命是艰难的，所以生命就好像是一场赛跑。保罗说，我也在这场赛跑里，但我要用那种能得冠冕的方式来跑。你知道吗？谈到我们的生命是一场赛跑的人，不只有保罗。在《__》这卷书里，还有人这么说：

在《希伯来书》中也说到，人生好像一场赛跑，但《希伯来书》给了我们一个秘诀，告诉我们如何跑，才能不被淘汰。

因为在《希伯来书》第12章，我们这样读到：要放下各样的重担，和容易缠累我们的罪，存心忍耐，奔那摆在我们前头的路程。怎么做到呢？仰望为我们信心创始成终的耶稣。他因那摆在前面的喜乐，就轻看羞辱，忍受了十字架的苦难，便坐在神宝座的右边。你看到《希伯来书》在说什么吗？如果你想跑得好，就看耶稣，因为他跑得好。

耶稣是一个奔跑者。耶稣离开天上，来到地上，成为一个人，他跑完了作为人的这场赛程，他一直跑到十字架那里，他忍受了一切，他从不放弃。即使不只是觉得心都要碎了，耶稣的心实际上也真的碎了，因为当士兵用枪扎他的时候，有血和水流出来。那么，他为什么要跑？是为了奖赏，那奖赏是什么呢？

就是那摆在他前面的喜乐。那是什么？耶稣基督来到世上，要赢得什么喜乐，是他在天上还没有的呢？他来到世上，是为了父的荣耀而奔跑吗？是的，但他本来就一直为父的荣耀而活。

我的意思是，他本来就拥有这一切。他是为了去爱天父吗？当然，是的，当他在地上的时候，他爱父；但这些他早就有了。他究竟缺少什么奖赏，非得来到地上，跑完这场赛程，走上十字架才能得着呢？答案是什么？

是你和我。你是耶稣的冠冕，你是耶稣的荣耀，你是他最宝贵的产业。当他跑那场赛程的时候，你要明白，他是历史上唯一一个跑完赛程、真正配得生命冠冕的人。你看，耶稣基督尽心、尽性、尽力、尽意爱神，也爱人如己，正如你我本应当活出的那样。但你看，我们当中没有一个像我们应该那样爱神，也没有一个像我们应该那样彼此相爱。我们全都被淘汰了。

我们没有一个人该得冠冕。耶稣是唯一一个跑完这场赛程、配得冠冕的人。

他本来配得生命的冠冕，对吗？可是当他完美地跑完那场赛程，走到他人生的终点时，他得到了什么？哦，他得到了一个冠冕。那是什么呢？

是荆棘冠冕吗？他也在头上戴上了一个“花环”。但他戴上了你我应得的荆棘冠冕，因为我们跑这场赛跑的方式。看，我们已经被判定为不合格了，可是他却戴上了荆棘冠冕，好叫当你信靠他时，我们就能得着他跑那场赛程所赢得的生命的冠冕。你难道不觉得这很美吗？

你难道不会为此而惊叹吗？每当你看到极其美丽的事物时，你是不是很想让别人也看到、也一同分享那祝福？当你听到极好的音乐时，你难道不会抓住你的朋友，说：“哎，戴上你的耳机听听这个！”因为你盼望那个人会说：“哇！”为什么呢？当然是因为你爱你的朋友，但也因为朋友在同一份美丽中的喜乐，会成全你在那美丽中的喜乐。

他或她越享受你觉得美的那件事，你就越享受它。这是很自然的，这是人的本能。而保罗在说的是：当我看到耶稣为我所做的一切，他怎样跑完这场赛程，又怎样戴上荆棘冠冕，好叫我可以得着生命的冠冕；当我意识到我是他的冠冕，你也是他的冠冕；

当我意识到他如此爱我们——那是什么？那是极美的。这就抓住了我的想象力，也抓住了我的心。在诗篇里有一处经文，诗人说：“求你使我专心敬畏你的名”（或作“求你联合我的心来敬畏你的名”）。你看，我们的心是分裂的。

这就是我们没有自制力的原因。你来联合我的心。而这一切会成就：注视福音，注视福音的美与爱，注视福音的恩典，直到它成为你生命里压倒一切的激情，它就会联合你的人生，联合你的心。然后，你就有了一样东西，能使你生命的每个部分都进入有序的掌管之下。

我想我需要……你知道，我知道，如果我们在这里停下，而不给任何实际的指引，有些人会说：这很振奋人心，但我不知道要怎样实际地抓住它、运用它。你看最后那三节经文，其实是我从第十章里抽出来的，再往下稍微一点点的地方。

事实上，这里有三件非常实际的事情，可以帮助你看到这种自制在你里面成长。我认为这三件事就是：圣经、群体和患难。圣经、群体和患难。这三样东西会逼迫你仰望耶稣——那位我们信心的创始成终者。

你越多地仰望他，越多地爱他，越多地看见他，你的生命就会越有秩序、越受管束。那三样东西是什么呢？首先，看第11节。这很快：“这些事都要作为鉴戒，并且写在经上。”

现在，他其实是在回顾他刚才在《出埃及记》里所讲的内容。他引用了《出埃及记》，讲到以色列人在旷野中的漂流。他在本章前面用这些事来应用在他们身上。我的结论是：当你看见耶稣基督受试探的时候——

那试探是什么？试探就是对你自制力的考验。每当耶稣受到撒旦的攻击，每当耶稣受到宗教领袖的攻击，甚至当耶稣受到行刑者的攻击并被钉十字架时，他如何应对每一次试探？用经文。他引用经文。

他熟知经文，他整个人被经文浸透，以至于无论发生什么，经文都会立刻浮现在他脑海中。这是我能告诉你关于自制的第一件最实际的事。无论你在自制方面的问题是什么，如果在你受试炼的时候，经文能立刻涌上心头，那会成为极大的帮助，因为它会立刻使你的心转向耶稣——我们信心的创始成终者。

你需要如此认识经文，如此背诵经文，如此被经文浸透，以至于当试炼来到时，它就立刻浮现在你心里。这是让这种自制在你里面成长的第一种非常非常实际的方式。第二是：群体。因为第12节说：“所以，自以为站立得稳的，须要谨慎，免得跌倒。”

这是一个劝勉。他在对哥林多人说：你们太自信了。你们过于自信，正在为自己的跌倒埋下伏笔。他在做什么？他在责备他们，在劝诫他们。我可以告诉你这一点：你永远不会在…中经历成长。

自制。如果你不向几位其他的基督徒敞开心扉，让他们来监督你，好像可以对你的生命说话一样——希伯来书 3:13 说：要天天彼此劝勉，免得你们中间有人被罪迷惑，心里就刚硬了。你必须要有一些人可以来与你谈话，否则你就不会在自制上成长。

所以，有圣经，有群体的监督，最后再看我刚才已经开始读的那节经文：没有临到你们的试探，……那些试探，那些临到你的困难，困难会考验你的自制力。没有临到你的试探，除了人所共遇的。神是信实的，必不叫你们受试探过于所能受的；在受试探的时候，总要给你们开一条出路，叫你们能忍受得住。

关于这一切，你可以讲一整篇讲道，但我可以向你指出这一点：没有人会在自制上成长，除非试炼临到你身上，困难压到你身上，你只能紧紧抓住神的信实，好让他带你度过。若不是试炼进入你的生命，让你看见自己在自制上有问题，你根本不会知道自己其实没有想象中那么有自制力。所以，除非你有这些困难——这些把你推向神怀中的困难，把你推向群体、朋友怀中的困难，把你推向圣经的困难——否则你不会在自制上成长。但每一次这些事、这些试炼和患难发生时，你就去到神面前说：主耶稣啊，使你自己在我里面成为又真又活的现实。

求你向我显得比以往任何时候都更加真实。他必如此行。于是你就会越来越在自制上成长。我们祷告。天父啊，我们都在自制上有挣扎。

事实上，我们的挣扎在许多情况下都相当隐秘。不是全部如此。我们当中很多人的自制挣扎是所有朋友都看得见的，但还有许多挣扎是我们藏得很深的。我祈求你，将你话语的探照灯，借着你圣灵的大能，把这些经文的话带进我们心里，那些我们也许刻意保持黑暗的角落里。

我们不愿意

我们承认，我们的问题摆在这里，却不知道该如何处理。我祈求，你话语这段经文中的话能照亮我们的心，使我们知道自己应该做什么。我们祈求你帮助我们在彼此之间有更多的督责，更紧紧地抓住你，好好处理这些问题，因为这些问题正在伤害我们，尤其是伤害我们帮助他人一同分享福音祝福的能力。

主啊，求你帮助我们。求你帮助我们在恩典中长进，更加认识你的儿子耶稣基督。奉祂的名祷告，阿们。
