Today, Tim Keller is unpacking one of the fruit  of the Spirit, helping us see what it means to move from trying to be good to truly  changing from the inside out. Tonight's Scripture comes from John 15 verses 6 through 15. If anyone does not remain  in me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers. Such branches are picked up,  thrown into the fire and burned. If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask  whatever you wish and it will be given you.

This is to my Father's glory that you bear  much fruit showing yourselves to be my disciples. As the Father has loved me so have I loved  you. Now, remain in my love. If you obey my commands, you will remain in my love just  as I have obeyed my Father's commands and remain in His love. I have told you this so  that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete.

My command is this, love  each other as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this that he lay down  his life for his friends. You are my friends if you do what I command. I no longer call  you servants because a servant does not know his Master's business. Instead, I have  called you friends.

For everything that I learned from my Father, I have made known to  you. This is the word of the Lord. The marks of a supernaturally changed heart. A heart  changed by the grace of God and the power of the Holy Spirit are listed in the classic  text Galatians 5, verse 22 and 23, which lists what's called there, the fruit of the Spirit,  and those traits are love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, and so on. And each week,  we're taking one of those traits and looking at it in order that perhaps we could experience  more of that supernatural change in our own lives.

Now, tonight we get to the trait,  the spiritual fruit of kindness. And whenever preachers are working through the fruit of  the Spirit, this is a big challenge, this particular one because the word kindness, the Greek  word translated kindness, in the New Testament has a real breadth of meaning, unfortunately. Sometimes it can be, depending on the context, translated fitting, sometimes pleasing, sometimes  honest, and sometimes compassionate. And therefore, how do you talk about kindness if it's a word  that has that kind of what they call a lexical range? And the answer is you can't do it abstractly.

You have to look at a relationship, a kind of relationship that combines all those traits,  and the kind of relationship that combines them all is friendship. And so what we're going to do  with tonight is look at friendship. Not that you can't have friends without a supernatural change  heart, but I think we're going to see there's a kind of friendship and there are resources for  friendship given to you in the gospel that are second to none. Now, one of the most iconic,  cinematic presentations of the power of friendship, it's so iconic that it's often mocked,  but it's still iconic, is the second of the old Frankenstein movies with Boris Karloff,  the bride of Frankenstein. There's one scene in which the monster lurches into a cottage in  the middle of the forest, and there's only one person living in the cottage, an old poor blind man.

And when the blind man comes to the door to meet the monster, of course he can't see him,  so he's not afraid, but he does sense that he can't speak. And so he says,  are we both afflicted? I cannot see and you cannot speak. Maybe he says we could be friends. So he brings the monster in and treats him kindly, constantly calling the friend, calling him  a friend.

And at one point the blind man kneels by the monster and begins to pray. And he prays,  our Father, I thank thee that in thy great mercy thou hast taken pity on my great loneliness,  and now out of the silence of the night has brought two of thy lonely children together  and has sent me a friend to be a light to my eyes and a comfort in my time of trouble. Amen. And the writer commenting on this part of the film says, in this incredible scene,  the monster sees the hermit break down and cry at the end of the prayer. The monster sheds a tear  and compassionately reaches out to comfort the crying man with a consoling pat on the back.

They both share a need for human friendship. During the prolonged fate out from the scene,  a glowing Christian crucifix is the last object to vanish from view. But of course, as any of you may  know, and you can always go see this on YouTube, it's up there. What happens eventually is the villagers  come to the cottage, they see the monster, they attack the cottage and they begin to set it on fire. And the last thing you see in this part of this scene is the Frankenstein monster lurching his  way out of the flames and out of the smoke saying, friend, friend, pleadingly, but there's no answer.

And the point is, nothing is more humanizing and nothing is more life changing than friendship. Why? How? Take a look at this passage, which is the classic passage in all the Bible. In fact,  it's, I think in all of religious literature, a unique passage about friendship.

There's nothing  like it anywhere else, and here's why. First of all, it tells us the nature or character friendship. Secondly, how you make it, how you forge friendship, and thirdly, where you get the power for it. First,  the character or nature of friendship. What's intriguing about this passage, and I gave you in a sense  a sample of it, is that the beginning of chapter 15, Jesus speaks about his relationship to the  disciples under the metaphor of vine and branches.

He says, I'm the vine, you're the branches. And that's a metaphor that talks about relationship, right? But it's a metaphor of deep unity,  because the vine and the branches share a common life. They share a common bond. But then around  verse nine or so, Jesus shifts into another metaphor.

And instead of calling the branches, you  are my branches, he starts calling them my friends. But they're very tied together as we're going  to see. There's actually a verb, the word remain, that he uses both when he's talking about  them as branches and when he's talking about them as friends. But there's more overlap between  this image of vine and branches and friends than you might think. Because in the Bible, friends  are often spoken of like this.

Deuteronomy 136, almost a throwaway statement. Deuteronomy 136 says,  if you have a brother, the son of your mother, or a friend who is as your own soul,  if you have a friend who is as your own soul. And then, of course, first Samuel 18, it says,  the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved David as his own soul. This idea of souls knit together is the biblical image of friendship. And I want you to think,  what does that mean?

Souls knit together? It's more than just mental agreement. You might have  a colleague you work with, and you both agree mentally, this is more than that. And frankly,  it's even more than sexual attraction. It's more than just the connection of bodies.

It's more than  just the connection of opinions. Souls knit together means you have common loves, common passions,  common beliefs, common interests. There's a couple of classic things you could read on this. I would go online and you'll find Ralph Walder Emerson wrote a fascinating essay on friendship. And of course, the chapter on friendship in C.S.

Lewis's book The Four Loves. And Ralph  Walder Emerson says, friends do not ask, do you love me? So much as do you see the same truth,  or do you care about the same truth as I do? The typical expression of an opening friendship  would be something like this. What?

You too? I thought I was the only one. That's how friendship  start. And C.S. Lewis puts it like this, though we can have erotic love and friendship with the same  person.

Yet in some ways, there's nothing less like a friendship than a love affair. Lovers are  always talking to one another about their love. Friends do not usually talk about their friendship. Lovers are normally faced to face, absorbed in one another, but friends stand side by side,  absorbed in some common interest. That is why those pathetic people who simply want friends can never  make any.

The very condition for having friends is that you want something else besides friends. If someone asks you, do you see the same truth as I? And your honest answer is, I don't really  care about the truth. I just want you to be my friend. No real friendship can start.

There would be  nothing for the friendship to be about. Those who have nothing can share nothing. Those who are going  nowhere can have no fellow travelers. And what is this? It means, basically, that friends are people  that you meet that have a common interest, a common passion, a common beliefs, and you immediately  fill a oneness.

And that means that to begin with, friends are discovered. There's a place in  Proverbs 27 that says, the counsel of a friend is pleasant. But the actual Hebrew word means sweet. And one of the problems with understanding of actually anything in the Bible is you have to  understand the original context. And in those days, you couldn't sweeten things.

Cooks couldn't do  that. They didn't have sugar in the places where the Bible was being written and at that time. You could discover sweetness. There are some foods that were naturally sweet, but cooks couldn't  create sweetness. So when it talks about friendships being sweet, it's talking about not something  you can create, but something you've discovered.

And so the way friendships begin is, what you too,  I thought I was the only one. You like that movie? You like that music? You like that kind of book? You too?

It's common beliefs, common bond. That's the beginning. But it's only the beginning,  because now, secondly, we need to go on to how you forge a friendship out of that beginning. Here's  why you can't. When I say friends are discovered, don't take that too far, because there's always an  initial sense of oneness with a person who can be a friend.

You click, you see it. And yet,  you are both human beings, meaning you're both flawed and you're both different from each other. And therefore, you'll never actually get past the difficulty of embracing someone who is  other than you, someone who is different than you, someone who, in spite of having some similarities,  is also very different. Embracing the other is incredibly costly. And turning a person who is a  potential friend into a lifelong friend, which is one of the great things there is in life,  takes work, two particular kinds of work, two particular kinds of discipline.

And here's what  they are. They're both here in this classic text. Jesus, when he says, you are my friends, he shows you  what the two things are, these two disciplines by which you turn would-be friends into real friends. And those two disciplines are vulnerable transparency and sacrificial loyalty. Vulnerable transparency, which you see in verse 15 and sacrificial loyalty, which you see in verse 13.

Look, first of all, vulnerable transparency. This amazing verse, you are my friends. If you do what  I mean, I no longer call you servants because the servant does not know his master's business. Instead,  I've called you friends for everything I learned from my father. I have made known to you.

See,  the difference between a boss and a friend. A boss says, do this. I don't have to explain myself. That's your job. A commander says, obey my order.

You don't have to explain yourself. That's  your job as you obey the commander. But he says, I'm not treating you just like that. I'm treating  you as a friend. Friends tell secrets.

Friends open up. Friends let you in. Friends show you what they're  really like, what they look like without their makeup on, what they're really dealing with, how  they're really feeling. There's an interesting verse in Psalms 25, verse 14. And if you look at  different translations, sometimes the translation is the secret of the Lord is with those who fear him.

The secret of the Lord is with his people. But sometimes it's translated. The friendship of the  Lord is with his people. And you know why the translators can't decide? Because the same Hebrew  word that means secret can also be translated friend.

You know why? Class? Because friends tell secrets. Because you're not a friend if you don't. There's a vulnerability and there's a transparency.

And you say, well, what does that mean? Well, let me go a little deeper then. Transparency means in  friendship. The ability to take and receive criticism well. Now, by the way, everybody gives and  takes criticisms.

But friends are people who give and take criticism well. And that's the reason why  you have verses like in Proverbs is the best place on this sort of thing. Verse 20, Proverbs 27, 6, faithful  are the wounds of a friend. That's the King James Version. Faithful are the wounds of a friend.

Isn't that great? Or Proverbs 29, 5 says, if you flatter someone, you're not their friend. Because that's the worst thing for them. You're letting them live within, inflated understanding of  what they can do. It's terrible for them.

Faithful are the wounds of a friend. Friends don't flatter  one another. And of course, the famous Proverbs 17, where it says, as iron, sharpens iron,  pardon me, this is Proverbs 27, 17, as iron, sharpens iron, so friend, sharpens a friend. In other words, look, very often, there's something you need to hear about yourself that you don't  want to hear. And you're not going to listen to it from a train counselor.

You're not going to  listen to it from a family member. You're not going to listen to it from a colleague. But if you  have a long time trusted friend, that you can't, in a sense, write off and shrug off as not caring  about you or not knowing you. See, friends know about you and friends care about you. They're not  people that have to be with you because they're not work colleagues.

They don't have to be with you  because they're family. They're friends. And very often, only long-time friends can tell you the  things you most need to hear. And if you don't have a lot of long-time friends, there's all kinds of  things you're never going to hear about yourself. You're just not going to grow.

So vulnerable transparency is the first thing. It's very hard. It's a discipline that you add  to a potential friend to make them into an actual friend. But then secondly, there's sacrificial  loyalty. And I find most intriguing the fact, which you can see in the text, that the word remain  is a word that Jesus uses, not only up when he's using the metaphor of the branches.

See,  verse six, if anyone does not remain in me, he's like a branch that's thrown away. What's he saying  there? He says, you know, you can't pull off branches overnight and put them back on and  expect it to work. Branches have to stay with the vine. If you take them off, they're never,  they never can have that same kind of unity.

But then later on, he says, I want you to remain in my  love. I want you to remain in my friendship. And what this means is friendship is about  remaining, sticking with people, through thick and thin. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God. Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to  face every situation, including death.

In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365 day devotional, the songs of  Jesus, you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have  a regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start. And if you already spend time  in study and prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest  emotions and questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with him.

It means on the one hand, in the most practical way, friends, and this is very hard, friends make  time for each other. Especially today, making time for each other is really tough. And therefore,  to even do that for somebody shows us a commitment, does it not? But more than that, it means  that you stick with people, you stick with your friends even when they're difficult or even when  they're going through difficulties, even when you're not getting much out of the relationship. That's what a friend does.

And that's the reason why I have these other famous proverbs about that. For example, a proverbs 17-17 that says, a friend loves it all times. Or proverbs 18-24, there's a friend stick closer than a brother. So there it is. Hear it.

What is it, friend? Friends, always let you in. Never let you down. Always let you in, vulnerable transparency. Never let you down,  sacrificial loyalty.

And by the way, 500, you can't have, therefore, 500 friends on Facebook or  Myspace. See, for example, when, I mean, I know they're called friends, but they don't fit this  definition. When, when Nathan the prophet comes to David, who's whole kingdom and his spiritual  destiny is, is tottering and he comes in and he says, thou art the man. Do you remember that? It's  in 2nd Samuel 12.

We actually looked at this in a sermon last year. He comes in and he says, David,  this is what you've done. You have sinned. You have betrayed your kingship and so forth. Do you have a Nathan in your life who can do that?

That can't be done on Facebook. It's got to be done face to face. You'll never listen to it otherwise. Friends, always let you in, never let you down. Are you applying this to potential friends to make them into actual friends?

Now, we're not done. And here's the reason why. We've looked at the nature of friendship  and we've looked at its power and we've looked at it. You know, it's forging. But where do you get  the power for it?

And here's what we have a lot against us. We have a lot against us. First of all, the very idea, let's look at this, vulnerable transparency,  unconditional, constancy, loyalty, frightening. It's kind of exciting to imagine people giving it to us,  but it's not all that exciting. Imagine you giving it to anybody else.

Because transparency is scary  and loyalty and constancy is draining. And we live in a culture that both in its messaging and  in its social structure does everything to keep you from developing friends. You know that. When you're in a place like New York, there's two kinds of relationships that are easier to happen  and falling off a log. One is what I'll call the network of colleagues.

There's a ton of people  that you need to know. You need to schmooze, you need to see, you need to spend time with,  you need to get to know and be friendly to who are people in your work or people you need to know  in order to do your work. It's your colleagues network. You got to know those people. And you do  know those people.

You enjoy those people. But the purpose of those relationships is your work,  career, money. The second set of networks, the second kind of set of relationships,  is your socializing network, people you party with, people you socialize with, people you have  romantic interest in, or you might have romantic interest in. So here's the people you party with  and the product is fun. And here's the people that you, you know, you network with and the product  is a career in advancement and money.

And they happen like that, but there's no investment  like this from you or in you. There's not sacrificial loyalty because the whole idea behind  social, these are going to be people who are, have fun with. These are going to be people who pay  off for you. Sacrificial loyalty is not part of it. Transparency is definitely not part of it.

And so you're going to starve. You're going to be impoverished. You're not going to get the things  that only friendships can give you. What are we going to do? You need the power to overcome the  natural fear, the scariness of transparency and the natural weakness that come when you consider  the constancy and the loyalty of friendship.

You need a power to help you overcome your fear  and your weakness. Where do we get that power to be friends? Where do we get the power to make  people the friends that we should right here? Do you know that Aristotle very wisely wrote a lot  about friendship, but one of the things he said is you can never be friends with a God. However you relate to God or to God, the gods, you could never be friends with the gods.

And the reason he said that was because he believed that all friendships had to be between  social equals. He did not believe friendship was possible unless you had the same amount of  social standing or power or education and so on. Because of course friendship is based on that  discovered commonality, common interest, common loves, common passions. And that happens to people  the same culture, of the same race, of the same class, of the same education level. And therefore  no way could you have a relationship with a God that was called friend.

And of course by the way,  I have been on panels with representatives of other religions many times over the years actually. And whenever I even try to talk about this, that we can know God as a friend,  I am told in no uncertain terms, usually respectfully, but also very strongly that that is an  inappropriate way of talking about God. That in their religions God is never talked like that. That's bringing God down. God cannot be your buddy.

God can't be your pal. God can't be your friend. And yet the Old Testament gives us hints. Exodus 33 says,  God spoke to Moses face to face as a man speaks to his friend. James chapter 2 says, Abraham, oh, what a great man.

And he was called the friend of God. But wait a minute, how could that be? Isn't Aristotle right? He's a smart guy. I mean,  how could God become vulnerable?

Friends are vulnerable. And how could God become loyal to you,  sacrificially? That's ridiculous. No, it's not. And you know it's not.

And now you know I know  other religion would dare say God could be your friend, but Christianity can and here's how. Because when God came to earth in Jesus Christ and went to the cross and died on the cross to pay  the penalty for our sins, that was, as Jesus himself says in verse 13, the ultimate act of friendship. The ultimate greater love has no one than this that he laid down his life for his friends. And  he's not talking in general. He's talking about the fact because the next day, that's what he's  going to do.

The cross is the ultimate. Listen, the cross is the ultimate act of friendship. You know how friends always let you in? Look at the cross. How much more open could he be to you?

His arms aren't just stretched open to you. They're nailed open. How much more vulnerable and  transparent do you want him to be? And friends, never let you down. How much more faithful?

How much more  sacrificial? How much more loyal could he possibly be than to go to the cross? You know when the  garden gets seminary, he saw all the people that he was supposed to be securing the pardon for,  all of his so-called disciples. They were betraying him. They were abandoning him.

They were falling asleep on him. They were about to deny him. And he knew that he could either go  to hell for them and take everything they deserved or he could lose them and he went to hell. There is a friend who sticks closer than a brother. There is the ultimate friend who loves it all  times.

And there is the ultimate friend whose wounds are faithful. Remember that proverb,  faithful to the wounds of a friend? But in this case, in Jesus Christ, these aren't the wounds  that the friend inflicts. These are the wounds that the friend bears for you and me. And see, it's simple, love economics.

Where do you get the power to reach out to people and  to be transparent to them when you might get hurt and to be loyal to them when you might be let down? It's simple, love economics. Look, verse 12, my command is this, love each other as I have loved you. I'm laying down my life for you. I'm pouring out my love for you.

And this is very simple. If you  are an incredibly wealthy person, you're a trillionaire. And there's a couple of people around you  that you like and they have some idea for an investment and the business plan is okay. But you know,  you're not totally sure about it. You're going to invest in them.

Why? Because you can afford. You  like them. You want to encourage them and you can afford to lose the money. That's exactly the  way it is.

If Jesus Christ friendship is the thing that just fills your heart, you can afford to open  up to other people. You can afford to take a risk because all friendship is a risk. You can  afford it because you've got the ultimate friend and the ultimate love of a friend. Now look,  let me give, let me apply this in three ways. Three ways.

Number one, we need to bring the idea  of friendship back into the center of our relationships between people of different races and different  classes and different nationalities. Aristotle was right that in general friendships only happen  between people of the same race. You can see it. People of the same class, people of the same  education, you can see it because the thing that the starter fuel you might say, the raw material  for friendship is a common bond, common belief, you know, common passion. But you realize what this  means if you're a Christian, do you realize what resource this is?

If you're a Christian and you  find somebody of a radically different race, completely different class, different gender, different  nationality, different politics, but they've had the same experience of Jesus Christ as you. They have the same passion for the gospel, they have the same interest and passion for the  scripture. Do you know what that means? You are capable of deep enriching friendships with people  who are utterly different from you. In other words, we need to completely show Aristotle he was wrong.

This is the reason why my friend Don Carson puts it like this,  the church is not made up of natural friends, it's made up of natural enemies. What binds us  together is not common education, common race, common income levels, common politics,  nationality, accents, jobs, or anything else of that sort. Christians come together because  they've been saved by Jesus Christ. We are a band of natural enemies turned into friends who  love one another for Jesus' sake. Christian love is mutual love between social incompatibles.

Do you know what it's like to have a deep friendship with a person who is socially utterly different  than you? In so enriching and it's possible. So let's bring friendship back into our relationships  across the races, across the classes. Number one, number two, we better bring friendship back  into the relationships between men and women. Here's what I mean.

Buy and large in this city  and buy and large even in this church. Men don't want to be friends with women. They either stay  away from the women or they want to date them and they only go after the people they want to date  have sex with. Now I can kind of understand staying away from women if you're a guy  or only going after the ones that you're kind of romantically interested in. If you're not a  Christian but if you're a Christian you've got no excuses and I'll tell you what's wrong.

If you're a bunch, here's 10 women in the room and two of them look attractive to you so you  head for them, try to get a relationship going with them. Maybe one of them might actually become  a friend, you know, if you're lucky. The best thing to do is to befriend the women, befriend the  Christian women around you and then if you fall in love with one, then you can actually trust  that the love is strong enough to build a lifetime marriage on. Don't you dare do what you're doing  which is to go after the women that you're attracted to and then maybe turn a couple of them into  friends. No, go befriend women and then see whether you fall in love with any of them.

That works. I know. So we need to bring friendship back into a relationship between men and women. This is  an opportunity you've got but within a Christian community that the rest of the world does not have  because it is true. It is tough to sometimes have friendships between men and women but Christianity  gives you that same ability that enables you to break, have friendships that break not only  through the racial cultural barriers but the gender barriers but number three.

You need to bring  friendship back into the center of your relationship with God. There are lots and lots of people  who are Christians and who believe in God and who obey God in general but they do not actually  do what Jesus is saying and that is befriend God. Jesus says if you're my friend you will obey my  commandments. You see that? If you're my friend you will remain in me.

What does that mean? Let's  say he's been vulnerable to you on the cross. He's been sacrificial to you on the cross. Now,  number one, obey him. Don't just obey him when it's convenient, obey him.

You sacrifice now. You  make yourself vulnerable. You go to the mat. You unconditionally say I'm going to do what you have said. I'm going to do your will to matter whether I understand it or not, no matter whether I like it or not.

Now you're starting to become a friend and then talk to him. A quiet time, a devotional in which you  read the Bible and pray should not just be getting some ideas and doing some petition. The Bible  study should be listening to God, a sense that he's talking to you, speaking through his word. Prayer should be talking back to God. Do you have a sense of his presence?

Does it happen regularly? Do you make time for it? There's nothing like it. That's what you need. Let me tell you why you  need it so badly.

We're all like Frankenstein monsters. You know that. Your self-image is a bunch of  stitched together contradictions. Your father didn't like you, but this person did like you,  and this person broke up with you and said these awful things, and you don't know what to believe  about yourself. In some ways, you have an overinflated view of some of your abilities and other  cases.

You're way too remorseful and ashamed of other parts of you. You're a Frankenstein  monster. What you need is one overmastering love. One person whose love heals you says, this is who  you are. One great ultimate friend.

And therefore, we're all like that Frankenstein monster  who's groping through the forest saying, I know I could come into my own if I could find  the ultimate friend that my heart is looking for. Well, Jesus, there he is. Let's pray. Thank you,  Father, for giving us the friendship that offering us the friendship that we most need,  which is friendship with you. And then giving us the power to create friendships in our lives,  which our culture does not really help us with, but your gospel empowers us to achieve.

When we  pray that you would help us to build on your friendship love and with that power, shape many,  many new friendships in this community, in this town, in our lives, so that we can become more and  more like your son, Jesus Christ, who laid down his life for his friends. It ain't we pray. Amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

Today, Tim Keller is unpacking one of the fruit  of the Spirit, helping us see what it means to move from trying to be good to truly  changing from the inside out. Tonight's Scripture comes from John 15 verses 6 through 15. If anyone does not remain  in me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers. Such branches are picked up,  thrown into the fire and burned. If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask  whatever you wish and it will be given you.

This is to my Father's glory that you bear  much fruit showing yourselves to be my disciples. As the Father has loved me so have I loved  you. Now, remain in my love. If you obey my commands, you will remain in my love just  as I have obeyed my Father's commands and remain in His love. I have told you this so  that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete.

My command is this, love  each other as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this that he lay down  his life for his friends. You are my friends if you do what I command. I no longer call  you servants because a servant does not know his Master's business. Instead, I have  called you friends.

For everything that I learned from my Father, I have made known to  you. This is the word of the Lord. The marks of a supernaturally changed heart. A heart  changed by the grace of God and the power of the Holy Spirit are listed in the classic  text Galatians 5, verse 22 and 23, which lists what's called there, the fruit of the Spirit,  and those traits are love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, and so on. And each week,  we're taking one of those traits and looking at it in order that perhaps we could experience  more of that supernatural change in our own lives.

Now, tonight we get to the trait,  the spiritual fruit of kindness. And whenever preachers are working through the fruit of  the Spirit, this is a big challenge, this particular one because the word kindness, the Greek  word translated kindness, in the New Testament has a real breadth of meaning, unfortunately. Sometimes it can be, depending on the context, translated fitting, sometimes pleasing, sometimes  honest, and sometimes compassionate. And therefore, how do you talk about kindness if it's a word  that has that kind of what they call a lexical range? And the answer is you can't do it abstractly.

You have to look at a relationship, a kind of relationship that combines all those traits,  and the kind of relationship that combines them all is friendship. And so what we're going to do  with tonight is look at friendship. Not that you can't have friends without a supernatural change  heart, but I think we're going to see there's a kind of friendship and there are resources for  friendship given to you in the gospel that are second to none. Now, one of the most iconic,  cinematic presentations of the power of friendship, it's so iconic that it's often mocked,  but it's still iconic, is the second of the old Frankenstein movies with Boris Karloff,  the bride of Frankenstein. There's one scene in which the monster lurches into a cottage in  the middle of the forest, and there's only one person living in the cottage, an old poor blind man.

And when the blind man comes to the door to meet the monster, of course he can't see him,  so he's not afraid, but he does sense that he can't speak. And so he says,  are we both afflicted? I cannot see and you cannot speak. Maybe he says we could be friends. So he brings the monster in and treats him kindly, constantly calling the friend, calling him  a friend.

And at one point the blind man kneels by the monster and begins to pray. And he prays,  our Father, I thank thee that in thy great mercy thou hast taken pity on my great loneliness,  and now out of the silence of the night has brought two of thy lonely children together  and has sent me a friend to be a light to my eyes and a comfort in my time of trouble. Amen. And the writer commenting on this part of the film says, in this incredible scene,  the monster sees the hermit break down and cry at the end of the prayer. The monster sheds a tear  and compassionately reaches out to comfort the crying man with a consoling pat on the back.

They both share a need for human friendship. During the prolonged fate out from the scene,  a glowing Christian crucifix is the last object to vanish from view. But of course, as any of you may  know, and you can always go see this on YouTube, it's up there. What happens eventually is the villagers  come to the cottage, they see the monster, they attack the cottage and they begin to set it on fire. And the last thing you see in this part of this scene is the Frankenstein monster lurching his  way out of the flames and out of the smoke saying, friend, friend, pleadingly, but there's no answer.

And the point is, nothing is more humanizing and nothing is more life changing than friendship. Why? How? Take a look at this passage, which is the classic passage in all the Bible. In fact,  it's, I think in all of religious literature, a unique passage about friendship.

There's nothing  like it anywhere else, and here's why. First of all, it tells us the nature or character friendship. Secondly, how you make it, how you forge friendship, and thirdly, where you get the power for it. First,  the character or nature of friendship. What's intriguing about this passage, and I gave you in a sense  a sample of it, is that the beginning of chapter 15, Jesus speaks about his relationship to the  disciples under the metaphor of vine and branches.

He says, I'm the vine, you're the branches. And that's a metaphor that talks about relationship, right? But it's a metaphor of deep unity,  because the vine and the branches share a common life. They share a common bond. But then around  verse nine or so, Jesus shifts into another metaphor.

And instead of calling the branches, you  are my branches, he starts calling them my friends. But they're very tied together as we're going  to see. There's actually a verb, the word remain, that he uses both when he's talking about  them as branches and when he's talking about them as friends. But there's more overlap between  this image of vine and branches and friends than you might think. Because in the Bible, friends  are often spoken of like this.

Deuteronomy 136, almost a throwaway statement. Deuteronomy 136 says,  if you have a brother, the son of your mother, or a friend who is as your own soul,  if you have a friend who is as your own soul. And then, of course, first Samuel 18, it says,  the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved David as his own soul. This idea of souls knit together is the biblical image of friendship. And I want you to think,  what does that mean?

Souls knit together? It's more than just mental agreement. You might have  a colleague you work with, and you both agree mentally, this is more than that. And frankly,  it's even more than sexual attraction. It's more than just the connection of bodies.

It's more than  just the connection of opinions. Souls knit together means you have common loves, common passions,  common beliefs, common interests. There's a couple of classic things you could read on this. I would go online and you'll find Ralph Walder Emerson wrote a fascinating essay on friendship. And of course, the chapter on friendship in C.S.

Lewis's book The Four Loves. And Ralph  Walder Emerson says, friends do not ask, do you love me? So much as do you see the same truth,  or do you care about the same truth as I do? The typical expression of an opening friendship  would be something like this. What?

You too? I thought I was the only one. That's how friendship  start. And C.S. Lewis puts it like this, though we can have erotic love and friendship with the same  person.

Yet in some ways, there's nothing less like a friendship than a love affair. Lovers are  always talking to one another about their love. Friends do not usually talk about their friendship. Lovers are normally faced to face, absorbed in one another, but friends stand side by side,  absorbed in some common interest. That is why those pathetic people who simply want friends can never  make any.

The very condition for having friends is that you want something else besides friends. If someone asks you, do you see the same truth as I? And your honest answer is, I don't really  care about the truth. I just want you to be my friend. No real friendship can start.

There would be  nothing for the friendship to be about. Those who have nothing can share nothing. Those who are going  nowhere can have no fellow travelers. And what is this? It means, basically, that friends are people  that you meet that have a common interest, a common passion, a common beliefs, and you immediately  fill a oneness.

And that means that to begin with, friends are discovered. There's a place in  Proverbs 27 that says, the counsel of a friend is pleasant. But the actual Hebrew word means sweet. And one of the problems with understanding of actually anything in the Bible is you have to  understand the original context. And in those days, you couldn't sweeten things.

Cooks couldn't do  that. They didn't have sugar in the places where the Bible was being written and at that time. You could discover sweetness. There are some foods that were naturally sweet, but cooks couldn't  create sweetness. So when it talks about friendships being sweet, it's talking about not something  you can create, but something you've discovered.

And so the way friendships begin is, what you too,  I thought I was the only one. You like that movie? You like that music? You like that kind of book? You too?

It's common beliefs, common bond. That's the beginning. But it's only the beginning,  because now, secondly, we need to go on to how you forge a friendship out of that beginning. Here's  why you can't. When I say friends are discovered, don't take that too far, because there's always an  initial sense of oneness with a person who can be a friend.

You click, you see it. And yet,  you are both human beings, meaning you're both flawed and you're both different from each other. And therefore, you'll never actually get past the difficulty of embracing someone who is  other than you, someone who is different than you, someone who, in spite of having some similarities,  is also very different. Embracing the other is incredibly costly. And turning a person who is a  potential friend into a lifelong friend, which is one of the great things there is in life,  takes work, two particular kinds of work, two particular kinds of discipline.

And here's what  they are. They're both here in this classic text. Jesus, when he says, you are my friends, he shows you  what the two things are, these two disciplines by which you turn would-be friends into real friends. And those two disciplines are vulnerable transparency and sacrificial loyalty. Vulnerable transparency, which you see in verse 15 and sacrificial loyalty, which you see in verse 13.

Look, first of all, vulnerable transparency. This amazing verse, you are my friends. If you do what  I mean, I no longer call you servants because the servant does not know his master's business. Instead,  I've called you friends for everything I learned from my father. I have made known to you.

See,  the difference between a boss and a friend. A boss says, do this. I don't have to explain myself. That's your job. A commander says, obey my order.

You don't have to explain yourself. That's  your job as you obey the commander. But he says, I'm not treating you just like that. I'm treating  you as a friend. Friends tell secrets.

Friends open up. Friends let you in. Friends show you what they're  really like, what they look like without their makeup on, what they're really dealing with, how  they're really feeling. There's an interesting verse in Psalms 25, verse 14. And if you look at  different translations, sometimes the translation is the secret of the Lord is with those who fear him.

The secret of the Lord is with his people. But sometimes it's translated. The friendship of the  Lord is with his people. And you know why the translators can't decide? Because the same Hebrew  word that means secret can also be translated friend.

You know why? Class? Because friends tell secrets. Because you're not a friend if you don't. There's a vulnerability and there's a transparency.

And you say, well, what does that mean? Well, let me go a little deeper then. Transparency means in  friendship. The ability to take and receive criticism well. Now, by the way, everybody gives and  takes criticisms.

But friends are people who give and take criticism well. And that's the reason why  you have verses like in Proverbs is the best place on this sort of thing. Verse 20, Proverbs 27, 6, faithful  are the wounds of a friend. That's the King James Version. Faithful are the wounds of a friend.

Isn't that great? Or Proverbs 29, 5 says, if you flatter someone, you're not their friend. Because that's the worst thing for them. You're letting them live within, inflated understanding of  what they can do. It's terrible for them.

Faithful are the wounds of a friend. Friends don't flatter  one another. And of course, the famous Proverbs 17, where it says, as iron, sharpens iron,  pardon me, this is Proverbs 27, 17, as iron, sharpens iron, so friend, sharpens a friend. In other words, look, very often, there's something you need to hear about yourself that you don't  want to hear. And you're not going to listen to it from a train counselor.

You're not going to  listen to it from a family member. You're not going to listen to it from a colleague. But if you  have a long time trusted friend, that you can't, in a sense, write off and shrug off as not caring  about you or not knowing you. See, friends know about you and friends care about you. They're not  people that have to be with you because they're not work colleagues.

They don't have to be with you  because they're family. They're friends. And very often, only long-time friends can tell you the  things you most need to hear. And if you don't have a lot of long-time friends, there's all kinds of  things you're never going to hear about yourself. You're just not going to grow.

So vulnerable transparency is the first thing. It's very hard. It's a discipline that you add  to a potential friend to make them into an actual friend. But then secondly, there's sacrificial  loyalty. And I find most intriguing the fact, which you can see in the text, that the word remain  is a word that Jesus uses, not only up when he's using the metaphor of the branches.

See,  verse six, if anyone does not remain in me, he's like a branch that's thrown away. What's he saying  there? He says, you know, you can't pull off branches overnight and put them back on and  expect it to work. Branches have to stay with the vine. If you take them off, they're never,  they never can have that same kind of unity.

But then later on, he says, I want you to remain in my  love. I want you to remain in my friendship. And what this means is friendship is about  remaining, sticking with people, through thick and thin. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God. Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to  face every situation, including death.

In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365 day devotional, the songs of  Jesus, you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have  a regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start. And if you already spend time  in study and prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest  emotions and questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with him. We'll send you  Tim and Kathy Keller's devotional as our thanks for your gift to help gospel and life share the  love of Jesus with more people. Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash give,  that's gospelandlife.com slash give.

It means on the one hand, in the most practical way, friends, and this is very hard, friends make  time for each other. Especially today, making time for each other is really tough. And therefore,  to even do that for somebody shows us a commitment, does it not? But more than that, it means  that you stick with people, you stick with your friends even when they're difficult or even when  they're going through difficulties, even when you're not getting much out of the relationship. That's what a friend does.

And that's the reason why I have these other famous proverbs about that. For example, a proverbs 17-17 that says, a friend loves it all times. Or proverbs 18-24, there's a friend stick closer than a brother. So there it is. Hear it.

What is it, friend? Friends, always let you in. Never let you down. Always let you in, vulnerable transparency. Never let you down,  sacrificial loyalty.

And by the way, 500, you can't have, therefore, 500 friends on Facebook or  Myspace. See, for example, when, I mean, I know they're called friends, but they don't fit this  definition. When, when Nathan the prophet comes to David, who's whole kingdom and his spiritual  destiny is, is tottering and he comes in and he says, thou art the man. Do you remember that? It's  in 2nd Samuel 12.

We actually looked at this in a sermon last year. He comes in and he says, David,  this is what you've done. You have sinned. You have betrayed your kingship and so forth. Do you have a Nathan in your life who can do that?

That can't be done on Facebook. It's got to be done face to face. You'll never listen to it otherwise. Friends, always let you in, never let you down. Are you applying this to potential friends to make them into actual friends?

Now, we're not done. And here's the reason why. We've looked at the nature of friendship  and we've looked at its power and we've looked at it. You know, it's forging. But where do you get  the power for it?

And here's what we have a lot against us. We have a lot against us. First of all, the very idea, let's look at this, vulnerable transparency,  unconditional, constancy, loyalty, frightening. It's kind of exciting to imagine people giving it to us,  but it's not all that exciting. Imagine you giving it to anybody else.

Because transparency is scary  and loyalty and constancy is draining. And we live in a culture that both in its messaging and  in its social structure does everything to keep you from developing friends. You know that. When you're in a place like New York, there's two kinds of relationships that are easier to happen  and falling off a log. One is what I'll call the network of colleagues.

There's a ton of people  that you need to know. You need to schmooze, you need to see, you need to spend time with,  you need to get to know and be friendly to who are people in your work or people you need to know  in order to do your work. It's your colleagues network. You got to know those people. And you do  know those people.

You enjoy those people. But the purpose of those relationships is your work,  career, money. The second set of networks, the second kind of set of relationships,  is your socializing network, people you party with, people you socialize with, people you have  romantic interest in, or you might have romantic interest in. So here's the people you party with  and the product is fun. And here's the people that you, you know, you network with and the product  is a career in advancement and money.

And they happen like that, but there's no investment  like this from you or in you. There's not sacrificial loyalty because the whole idea behind  social, these are going to be people who are, have fun with. These are going to be people who pay  off for you. Sacrificial loyalty is not part of it. Transparency is definitely not part of it.

And so you're going to starve. You're going to be impoverished. You're not going to get the things  that only friendships can give you. What are we going to do? You need the power to overcome the  natural fear, the scariness of transparency and the natural weakness that come when you consider  the constancy and the loyalty of friendship.

You need a power to help you overcome your fear  and your weakness. Where do we get that power to be friends? Where do we get the power to make  people the friends that we should right here? Do you know that Aristotle very wisely wrote a lot  about friendship, but one of the things he said is you can never be friends with a God. However you relate to God or to God, the gods, you could never be friends with the gods.

And the reason he said that was because he believed that all friendships had to be between  social equals. He did not believe friendship was possible unless you had the same amount of  social standing or power or education and so on. Because of course friendship is based on that  discovered commonality, common interest, common loves, common passions. And that happens to people  the same culture, of the same race, of the same class, of the same education level. And therefore  no way could you have a relationship with a God that was called friend.

And of course by the way,  I have been on panels with representatives of other religions many times over the years actually. And whenever I even try to talk about this, that we can know God as a friend,  I am told in no uncertain terms, usually respectfully, but also very strongly that that is an  inappropriate way of talking about God. That in their religions God is never talked like that. That's bringing God down. God cannot be your buddy.

God can't be your pal. God can't be your friend. And yet the Old Testament gives us hints. Exodus 33 says,  God spoke to Moses face to face as a man speaks to his friend. James chapter 2 says, Abraham, oh, what a great man.

And he was called the friend of God. But wait a minute, how could that be? Isn't Aristotle right? He's a smart guy. I mean,  how could God become vulnerable?

Friends are vulnerable. And how could God become loyal to you,  sacrificially? That's ridiculous. No, it's not. And you know it's not.

And now you know I know  other religion would dare say God could be your friend, but Christianity can and here's how. Because when God came to earth in Jesus Christ and went to the cross and died on the cross to pay  the penalty for our sins, that was, as Jesus himself says in verse 13, the ultimate act of friendship. The ultimate greater love has no one than this that he laid down his life for his friends. And  he's not talking in general. He's talking about the fact because the next day, that's what he's  going to do.

The cross is the ultimate. Listen, the cross is the ultimate act of friendship. You know how friends always let you in? Look at the cross. How much more open could he be to you?

His arms aren't just stretched open to you. They're nailed open. How much more vulnerable and  transparent do you want him to be? And friends, never let you down. How much more faithful?

How much more  sacrificial? How much more loyal could he possibly be than to go to the cross? You know when the  garden gets seminary, he saw all the people that he was supposed to be securing the pardon for,  all of his so-called disciples. They were betraying him. They were abandoning him.

They were falling asleep on him. They were about to deny him. And he knew that he could either go  to hell for them and take everything they deserved or he could lose them and he went to hell. There is a friend who sticks closer than a brother. There is the ultimate friend who loves it all  times.

And there is the ultimate friend whose wounds are faithful. Remember that proverb,  faithful to the wounds of a friend? But in this case, in Jesus Christ, these aren't the wounds  that the friend inflicts. These are the wounds that the friend bears for you and me. And see, it's simple, love economics.

Where do you get the power to reach out to people and  to be transparent to them when you might get hurt and to be loyal to them when you might be let down? It's simple, love economics. Look, verse 12, my command is this, love each other as I have loved you. I'm laying down my life for you. I'm pouring out my love for you.

And this is very simple. If you  are an incredibly wealthy person, you're a trillionaire. And there's a couple of people around you  that you like and they have some idea for an investment and the business plan is okay. But you know,  you're not totally sure about it. You're going to invest in them.

Why? Because you can afford. You  like them. You want to encourage them and you can afford to lose the money. That's exactly the  way it is.

If Jesus Christ friendship is the thing that just fills your heart, you can afford to open  up to other people. You can afford to take a risk because all friendship is a risk. You can  afford it because you've got the ultimate friend and the ultimate love of a friend. Now look,  let me give, let me apply this in three ways. Three ways.

Number one, we need to bring the idea  of friendship back into the center of our relationships between people of different races and different  classes and different nationalities. Aristotle was right that in general friendships only happen  between people of the same race. You can see it. People of the same class, people of the same  education, you can see it because the thing that the starter fuel you might say, the raw material  for friendship is a common bond, common belief, you know, common passion. But you realize what this  means if you're a Christian, do you realize what resource this is?

If you're a Christian and you  find somebody of a radically different race, completely different class, different gender, different  nationality, different politics, but they've had the same experience of Jesus Christ as you. They have the same passion for the gospel, they have the same interest and passion for the  scripture. Do you know what that means? You are capable of deep enriching friendships with people  who are utterly different from you. In other words, we need to completely show Aristotle he was wrong.

This is the reason why my friend Don Carson puts it like this,  the church is not made up of natural friends, it's made up of natural enemies. What binds us  together is not common education, common race, common income levels, common politics,  nationality, accents, jobs, or anything else of that sort. Christians come together because  they've been saved by Jesus Christ. We are a band of natural enemies turned into friends who  love one another for Jesus' sake. Christian love is mutual love between social incompatibles.

Do you know what it's like to have a deep friendship with a person who is socially utterly different  than you? In so enriching and it's possible. So let's bring friendship back into our relationships  across the races, across the classes. Number one, number two, we better bring friendship back  into the relationships between men and women. Here's what I mean.

Buy and large in this city  and buy and large even in this church. Men don't want to be friends with women. They either stay  away from the women or they want to date them and they only go after the people they want to date  have sex with. Now I can kind of understand staying away from women if you're a guy  or only going after the ones that you're kind of romantically interested in. If you're not a  Christian but if you're a Christian you've got no excuses and I'll tell you what's wrong.

If you're a bunch, here's 10 women in the room and two of them look attractive to you so you  head for them, try to get a relationship going with them. Maybe one of them might actually become  a friend, you know, if you're lucky. The best thing to do is to befriend the women, befriend the  Christian women around you and then if you fall in love with one, then you can actually trust  that the love is strong enough to build a lifetime marriage on. Don't you dare do what you're doing  which is to go after the women that you're attracted to and then maybe turn a couple of them into  friends. No, go befriend women and then see whether you fall in love with any of them.

That works. I know. So we need to bring friendship back into a relationship between men and women. This is  an opportunity you've got but within a Christian community that the rest of the world does not have  because it is true. It is tough to sometimes have friendships between men and women but Christianity  gives you that same ability that enables you to break, have friendships that break not only  through the racial cultural barriers but the gender barriers but number three.

You need to bring  friendship back into the center of your relationship with God. There are lots and lots of people  who are Christians and who believe in God and who obey God in general but they do not actually  do what Jesus is saying and that is befriend God. Jesus says if you're my friend you will obey my  commandments. You see that? If you're my friend you will remain in me.

What does that mean? Let's  say he's been vulnerable to you on the cross. He's been sacrificial to you on the cross. Now,  number one, obey him. Don't just obey him when it's convenient, obey him.

You sacrifice now. You  make yourself vulnerable. You go to the mat. You unconditionally say I'm going to do what you have said. I'm going to do your will to matter whether I understand it or not, no matter whether I like it or not.

Now you're starting to become a friend and then talk to him. A quiet time, a devotional in which you  read the Bible and pray should not just be getting some ideas and doing some petition. The Bible  study should be listening to God, a sense that he's talking to you, speaking through his word. Prayer should be talking back to God. Do you have a sense of his presence?

Does it happen regularly? Do you make time for it? There's nothing like it. That's what you need. Let me tell you why you  need it so badly.

We're all like Frankenstein monsters. You know that. Your self-image is a bunch of  stitched together contradictions. Your father didn't like you, but this person did like you,  and this person broke up with you and said these awful things, and you don't know what to believe  about yourself. In some ways, you have an overinflated view of some of your abilities and other  cases.

You're way too remorseful and ashamed of other parts of you. You're a Frankenstein  monster. What you need is one overmastering love. One person whose love heals you says, this is who  you are. One great ultimate friend.

And therefore, we're all like that Frankenstein monster  who's groping through the forest saying, I know I could come into my own if I could find  the ultimate friend that my heart is looking for. Well, Jesus, there he is. Let's pray. Thank you,  Father, for giving us the friendship that offering us the friendship that we most need,  which is friendship with you. And then giving us the power to create friendships in our lives,  which our culture does not really help us with, but your gospel empowers us to achieve.

When we  pray that you would help us to build on your friendship love and with that power, shape many,  many new friendships in this community, in this town, in our lives, so that we can become more and  more like your son, Jesus Christ, who laid down his life for his friends. It ain't we pray. Amen.

### 引言：意志力与超自然改变的区别

圣经说，意志力驱动的心与超自然改变的心之间有天壤之别。今天，Tim Keller 正在解读圣灵的果子之一，帮助我们看到从努力做好人到真正从内心改变的意义。今晚的经文来自约翰福音 15 章 6 到 15 节。

> “人若不常在我里面，就像枝子丢在外面枯干，人拾起来扔在火里烧了。你们若常在我里面，我的话也常在你们里面，凡你们所愿意的，祈求就给你们成就。你们多结果子，我父因此得荣耀，你们也就是我的门徒了。父怎样爱我，我也怎样爱你们，你们要常在我的爱里。你们若遵守我的命令，就常在我的爱里，正如我遵守了我父的命令，常在他的爱里。这些事我已经对你们说了，是要叫我的喜乐存在你们心里，并叫你们的喜乐可以满足。这是我的命令：你们要彼此相爱，像我爱你们一样。人为朋友舍命，人的爱心没有比这个大的。你们若遵行我所吩咐的，就是我的朋友了。以后我不再称你们为仆人，因为仆人不知道主人所做的事。我乃称你们为朋友，因为我从我父所听见的，已经都告诉你们了。”

**这是主的话。**

### 友谊的本质

超自然改变的心的标志。一个被上帝的恩典和圣灵的力量改变的心，在经典文本加拉太书 5 章 22 和 23 节中列出，那里被称为圣灵的果子，这些特质是爱、喜乐、和平、忍耐、仁慈、良善等等。每周，我们都会选择其中一个特质进行探讨，以便我们在自己的生活中可能体验到更多的超自然改变。

现在，今晚我们要谈到的特质是仁慈的属灵果子。每当传道人在讲解圣灵的果子时，这都是一个巨大的挑战，尤其是这个，因为在新约中翻译为仁慈的希腊词具有非常广泛的意义。不幸的是，有时根据上下文，它可以被翻译为合适，有时是令人愉快，有时是诚实，有时是富有同情心。

### 如何建立友谊

因此，如果仁慈是一个具有这种所谓词汇范围的词，你如何谈论它？答案是你不能抽象地谈论它。你必须看一种关系，一种结合所有这些特质的关系，而结合它们的关系就是友谊。

因此，今晚我们要做的是看友谊。并不是说没有超自然改变的心就不能有朋友，但我认为我们会看到，在福音中给予你的友谊资源是无与伦比的。

### 友谊的力量

首先，友谊的特性或本质。这个段落中有趣的是，我在某种意义上给了你一个样本，是在第 15 章的开头，耶稣用葡萄树和枝子的比喻来谈论他与门徒的关系。他说，我是葡萄树，你们是枝子。这是一个谈论关系的比喻，对吗？但这是一个深度统一的比喻，因为葡萄树和枝子共享一个共同的生命。他们共享一个共同的纽带。

### 应用：跨越差异的友谊

这是什么意思？基本上，这意味着朋友是你遇到的有共同兴趣、共同激情、共同信仰的人，你立即感到一种合一。这意味着，首先，朋友是被发现的。

> “朋友的劝告是愉快的。”

但实际的希伯来词意为甜美。理解圣经中任何事物的一个问题是你必须理解原始背景。在那些日子里，你不能使东西变甜。厨师做不到。他们没有糖在圣经写作的地方和那个时代。你可以发现甜味。有些食物是天然甜的，但厨师无法创造甜味。

**因此，当谈到友谊是甜美的时，它谈论的不是你可以创造的东西，而是你发现的东西。**

今天，提姆·凯勒要拆解圣灵果子中的一个，帮我们看见，什么叫从“努力做好人”真正转向“从里面被改变”。今晚的经文出自约翰福音15章6到15节：「人若不常在我里面，就像枝子丢在外面枯干，人拾起来，扔在火里烧了。你们若常在我里面，我的话也常在你们里面，凡你们所愿意的，祈求就给你们成就。

你们多结果子，我父就因此得荣耀，你们也就是我的门徒了。我爱你们，正如父爱我一样；你们要常在我的爱里。你们若遵守我的命令，就常在我的爱里，正如我遵守了我父的命令，常在他的爱里。我对你们说了这些事，是要叫我的喜乐存在你们心里，并叫你们的喜乐可以满足。

你们要彼此相爱，像我爱你们一样，这就是我的命令。人为朋友舍命，人的爱心没有比这个大的。你们若遵行我所吩咐的，就是我的朋友了。以后我不再称你们为仆人，因为仆人不知道主人所做的事；我乃称你们为朋友，因我从我父所听见的一切，都已经告诉你们了。」这是主的话。

一颗被神的恩典、圣灵的大能所改变的心——一颗“超自然改变”的心——它的记号，列在经典的经文加拉太书5章22–23节里面，经文说那里叫作“圣灵所结的果子”，那些特质包括：仁爱、喜乐、和平、忍耐、恩慈、良善等等。我们每一周拿其中一个特质来思想，好叫我们或许也能在自己生命中经历更多这样超自然的改变。

那么，今晚我们来到的这一项，就是“恩慈”——属灵果子的“kindness”。每当讲道的人讲到圣灵果子，讲到这一项的时候，都会遇到一个大挑战。因为新约里被翻译作“恩慈”（kindness）的这个希腊词，意思范围非常宽广。不幸的是，它有时候按照上下文可以翻成“合宜的”“合适的”（fitting），有时候是“令人喜悦的”（pleasing），有时候是“诚实的”（honest），有时候又是“怜悯、慈悲的”（compassionate）。那你要怎么讲“恩慈”呢？如果一个词的所谓“词汇语义范围”（lexical range）这么大，你就没办法抽象地去讲它。

你必须去看一种关系，一种把这些特质全部都综合在一起的关系。而能把这些都结合在一起的那种关系，就是“友谊”。所以今晚我们要做的是，从“友谊”来谈。不是说没有经历过超自然改变的人就不可能有朋友；但我想我们会看到，福音给了我们一种友谊，给了我们建立友谊的资源，是独一无二、无人可比的。

在电影史上，关于友谊力量的一个最具标志性的画面——它太经典了，以至于经常被拿来戏仿——出现在老版第二部《弗兰肯斯坦》电影里，由鲍里斯·卡洛夫主演的《弗兰肯斯坦的新娘》。其中有一个片段：怪物跌跌撞撞走进森林深处的一间小屋，屋里只有一个人，是一个贫穷年老的瞎眼人。

老盲人来到门口迎接怪物，当然看不见他，所以不会害怕。但他感受到这个人不会说话，于是就说：「我们是不是都带着缺陷？我看不见，而你不会说话。也许我们可以做朋友。」于是他把怪物迎进屋子，善待他，不断称他为“朋友”。

有一幕是盲人跪在怪物身边开始祷告。他祷告说：「我们的父啊，我感谢你，在你大怜悯中顾念了我极深的孤独，如今在这夜的寂静中，你把你两个孤单的孩子带到一起，赐给我一个朋友，作我眼目的光，在我患难的时候安慰我。阿们。」有位评论这段电影的作者说，在这极其动人的一幕里，怪物看见隐士在祷告结束时放声痛哭。怪物自己也掉下眼泪，怜悯地伸手安慰这位哭泣的人，轻轻拍着他的背。

他们都深深需要人的友谊。镜头缓缓淡出时，画面最后消失的，是一幅发光的十字架。但当然，如你们当中很多人知道的——你随时可以在 YouTube 上看到这一段——后来村民们来到小屋，看见怪物，就攻击小屋，把它点燃。这个片段最后的画面，是弗兰肯斯坦怪物在火焰与烟雾中踉跄逃出，一边走一边呼喊：“朋友，朋友”，带着恳求，却再也没有回应。

重点是：没有什么比友谊更能使人“成为人”，也没有什么比友谊更具有改变生命的力量。为什么？怎么会这样？来看这段经文——这是整本圣经里关于友谊最经典的一段。事实上，我认为在整个宗教文学里，它都是独一无二的。没有任何别的地方有像这里这样的描述，原因在这儿：首先，它告诉我们友谊的本质或特征；其次，它告诉我们如何建立、如何“锻造”友谊；最后，它告诉我们从哪里得到活出友谊的力量。

首先，友谊的本质或性质是什么？这段经文中有一个很耐人寻味的地方，我刚才读的只是其中一部分。约翰福音15章的开头，耶稣用“葡萄树和枝子”的比喻来讲他跟门徒之间的关系。他说：「我是葡萄树，你们是枝子。」那是一个谈关系的比喻，对吧？但那是一个讲“深度合一”的比喻，因为葡萄树和枝子共享同样的生命，同样的联结。

但到了大约第9节左右，耶稣换了一个比喻。他不再称他们为“枝子”，而开始称他们为“朋友”。不过这两幅图像其实紧密相连，我们会看到的。经文里有一个动词——“常在”（remain，或译“住在”）——既用在葡萄树与枝子的比喻里，也用在朋友的关系上。

而且，“葡萄树和枝子”的形象与“朋友”的形象之间的重叠，其实比你想象的更多。因为在圣经里，朋友常常被这样描述：申命记13章6节，有一句话几乎是顺带提到的：「你同母的兄弟，或是你儿女，或是你怀中的妻，或是与你性命相近的朋友……」——和你“性命相近的朋友”。

再比如撒母耳记上18章，说：「约拿单的心与大卫的心深相契合，约拿单爱大卫如同爱自己的性命。」“心相契合”——灵魂与灵魂“缠在一起”——这是圣经表达友谊的一个图像。想一想，这是什么意思？灵魂缠在一起？

这不只是“思想上认同”。你可能有一个同事，跟你在思想上很一致，但这比那个要多得多。而且，这甚至比“性吸引”更深入，它不是仅仅“身体的连结”；也不只是“观点的连结”。“灵魂缠在一起”意味着你们有共同的所爱、共同的热情、共同的信念、共同的兴趣。

有几篇关于友谊的经典文章你可以去找，比如爱默生那篇精彩的《论友谊》的文章；还有 C.S. 路易斯《四种爱》其中谈友谊的一章。爱默生说，朋友之间不会总是在问：「你爱我吗？」他们更常问的是：「你也看见同样的真理吗？你也在意那件真理吗？」一段友谊的开启，典型的表达方式会是这样一句话：「什么？你也是？我以为只有我一个人这样。」友谊就是这样开始的。

C.S. 路易斯则这样说：虽然我们可能同时在同一个人身上经历“情欲之爱”（eros）和“友谊之爱”，但在某种意义上，没有什么比恋爱关系更不像友谊。相恋的人总是在彼此谈论他们的爱情；朋友通常不会谈论“我们的友谊”。相恋的人是面对面，相互迷恋；朋友是肩并肩，一起专注于某个共同的兴趣。所以，那些可怜的人“只是想要朋友”，反而永远交不到朋友。

因为拥有友谊的先决条件，是你想要的是“朋友以外的东西”。如果有人对你说：「你也看见同样的真理吗？」而你诚实的回答是：「其实我不在乎什么真理，我只想你做我的朋友。」那真正的友谊根本没法开始——因为它没有任何“内容”可言。没有东西可以“成为”友谊的对象。那些一无所有的人，没什么可以分享；那些不往任何地方去的人，也不可能有“同行者”。

这是什么意思？基本上就是：朋友是那些你遇见的人，他们与你有共同的兴趣、共同的热情、共同的信念，于是你立刻感到一种“合一”。这就意味着，一开始，朋友是“被发现”的。箴言27章有一句话说：朋友的劝告是“甘甜的”。但希伯来原文的意思是“甜”。

理解圣经任何东西，都要先了解原来的处境。在那个时代，在写圣经的那些地方，厨师是没办法“做出”甜味来的。他们没有糖。你可以“发现”甜味，有些食物本身就是甜的，但厨师没法凭本事创造甜。所以当圣经说友谊是“甘甜的”，它说的不是你能“制造”的东西，而是你“发现”的东西。

所以，友谊的开始方式是：「什么，你也是？我以为只有我一个人。你也喜欢那部电影？你也喜欢那种音乐？你也喜欢那样的书？你也是？」共同的信念、共同的连结——这是起点。但这只是起点。

因为接下来，我们要看第二点：怎样把这个起点锻造成真正的友谊。我要解释为什么我说“不能只停在发现”。当我说朋友是“被发现”的时候，不要把这话听得太绝对。因为在所有潜在的朋友当中，总是会有一种初始的“合一感”：你们一见如故，你能看出来。但同时，你们又都是人——而做为人，就意味着你们都有缺陷，而且你们彼此也有差异。

所以，你永远不可能绕过那件事：真正地拥抱一个“与自己不同的人”。一个虽然跟你有一些相似之处，却也在很多地方和你不一样的人。去拥抱那个“他者”（other），是要付代价的。而要把一个潜在的朋友变成一生的朋友——那是生命中最美好的事之一——就一定需要付出努力，需要两个特别的操练。

这两个操练是什么？这段经典的经文里，当耶稣说「你们是我的朋友」的时候，就向你展示了。把可能成为朋友的人，变成真正的朋友，要这两种操练：第一，“脆弱的坦诚”（vulnerable transparency）；第二，“牺牲的忠诚”（sacrificial loyalty）。脆弱的坦诚见于15节；牺牲的忠诚见于13节。

先看脆弱的坦诚。那节经文很惊人：「你们若遵行我所吩咐的，就是我的朋友了。以后我不再称你们为仆人，因为仆人不知道主人所做的事；我乃称你们为朋友，因我从我父所听见的一切，都已经告诉你们了。」你看，主人和朋友之间的区别在哪里？

主人会说：「去做这件事。」他不用向你解释自己——那是你的工作。军官会说：「服从命令。」他不必向你解释——那是你身为士兵的本分。但耶稣说：「我不只是这样对待你们。我把你们当朋友。」朋友会彼此说“心里的话”；朋友会打开自己；朋友让你进入他的世界；朋友给你看他真正是什么样子——卸掉妆容的时候、他真正面对的是什么事、他真实的感受是什么。

诗篇25篇14节有句有趣的话：如果你看不同译本，有的翻成：「耶和华与敬畏他的人亲密（或：有亲密的交往）」，也可以翻作：「耶和华把他的秘密指示那些敬畏他的人。」为什么译者拿不定主意？因为同一个希伯来词，既可以译作“密友”，也可以译作“奥秘、秘密”。你知道为什么吗？因为“朋友会说秘密”。如果你从来不向某人吐露心底的话，不向他敞开，那么严格来说，你们其实还不是朋友。

你说，那这具体意味着什么？那我们再往下讲一层。“坦诚”意味着，在友谊里，能够给出并接纳批评——而且是健康地给、健康地接纳。当然，每个人都会批评、也都会被批评。但朋友，是那些“会好好给、也会好好接纳批评”的人。这就是为什么箴言里有那么多关于这件事的经文。

最经典的一句在箴言27章6节：「朋友加的伤痕出于忠诚。」（和合本：朋友加的伤痕是出于忠诚。）是不是很棒？再比如箴言29章5节说：「谄媚人的，就是为他的脚设网。」如果你只是逢迎奉承，你就不是那个人真正的朋友——因为那是对他最糟糕的事，你让他活在一个膨胀的自我认识里，以为自己能做到很多其实做不到的事，这对他非常有害。

朋友的伤痕是出于忠诚；朋友不会只是一味奉承。当然，还有那句有名的箴言27章17节：「铁磨铁，磨出刃来；朋友相感，也是如此。」也就是说，往往有些关于你自己的事，是你必须听见，却又一点也不想听的。你不会听训练有素的心理咨询师说的；你不会听家人讲的；你不会听同事说的。

但如果那是一个认识你很久、你信任已久的朋友，你就没办法轻易把他“划掉”，也没办法说他“不关心你”“不了解你”。朋友是认识你的人，是关心你的人——他们不是因为工作非要跟你在一起的同事，也不是血缘束缚的家人，而是“选择要与你在一起”的人。往往只有这样的老朋友，才能对你说那句你最需要听的话。如果你没有一些长久的友谊，那会有很多关于你自己的事，你这一生都不可能听见——你就不会成长。

所以，脆弱的坦诚是第一件事。这很难，是你必须刻意操练的功课，要把潜在的朋友，变成真正的朋友。但第二，还有牺牲的忠诚。

我觉得最耐人寻味的是这样一个事实，从经文你可以看见：耶稣用“常在”（remain）这个字，不只用在葡萄树和枝子的比喻里。你看第6节：「人若不常在我里面，就像枝子丢在外面枯干。」他在说什么？他说，你不能今天把枝子拆下来，明天再装回去，还指望它能活。枝子必须一直待在葡萄树上。如果你把它折下来，它就再也不可能恢复那样的联合。

但后来他又说：「要常在我的爱里。」要“常在”他的友谊里。这是什么意思？意味着友谊就是“常在”，就是坚持与人同行，在顺境和逆境都不离不弃。

诗篇可以深刻地塑造你亲近神的方式。连耶稣自己，都以诗篇来面对一切处境，甚至包括死亡。在提姆和凯西·凯勒合著的365天灵修书《耶稣的诗歌》里，你会每天读一篇诗篇，经文配上新的圣经洞见。如果你还没有固定的灵修习惯，这本书是很好的起点；如果你已经在规律研经和祷告，借着诗篇来祷告，可以帮助你把最深的情感和问题带到神面前，与他建立更亲密的关系。只要你奉献支持“福音与生命”（Gospel in Life）的事工，把耶稣的爱分享给更多人，我们就会把这本灵修书送给你，表达我们的感谢。你可以在 gospelandlife.com/give 索取一本。

另一方面，从最现实的层面讲，友谊意味着——这非常不容易——朋友要彼此“腾出时间”。在今天这个时代，为别人腾出时间真的是一件很难的事。因此，当你真的愿意为某人腾出时间，那本身就已经是一个承诺的记号，不是吗？

但不止如此，这也意味着，即便对方变得很难相处，或者对方正经历艰难，你从这段关系里暂时得不到什么“好处”，你仍然不离不弃，仍然陪着他走下去——这才叫朋友。箴言里有很多这样有名的话，例如箴言17章17节：「朋友乃时常亲爱。」又如箴言18章24节：「有朋友比弟兄更亲密。」

所以，总结一下，朋友是什么？朋友是那些“总是让你能走进他里面的人”（always let you in），又是那些“不会在你最需要的时候让你失望的人”（never let you down）。总是让你能走进他里面——脆弱的坦诚；不会让你失望——牺牲的忠诚。

顺便说一下，你不可能在 Facebook 或其他社交媒体上拥有500个这样的朋友。比如，当先知拿单去见大卫的时候——那时候整个国度和他的属灵命运都岌岌可危——拿单走到他面前，对他说：「你就是那人。」还记得吗？在撒母耳记下12章，我们去年有一篇讲道专门讲过。拿单说：「大卫，你做了什么，你犯了罪，你背叛了你的王位。」你生命中有没有一个“拿单”？一个可以这样对你说话的人？

这不可能通过 Facebook 完成。这必须是面对面的，否则你不会听进去。朋友，是让你能走进他里面，又不会在你最需要的时候让你失望的人。你有在用这套标准，来帮助潜在的朋友成长为真正的朋友吗？

不过，我们还没讲完。原因很简单：我们刚谈了友谊的本质，也谈了友谊的力量、友谊的锻造。但我们还没回答一个最关键的问题：你从哪里获得活出这种友谊的力量？

在这件事上，我们有很多阻力。首先，从一开始，“脆弱的坦诚”和“无条件的坚持、忠诚”，都让人有点害怕。想像别人对你这样做——这样向你敞开，这样对你忠诚——这是很令人兴奋的。但要你去这样对别人，就没那么兴奋了。因为“坦诚”会让你暴露在伤害的风险之下；而“忠诚和坚持”则会耗费你大量的精力。

除此之外，我们所处的文化，无论在它传达的信息上，还是在它的社会结构上，都在尽一切可能阻止你发展真正的友谊。你知道的。在像纽约这样的城市，有两种关系是轻而易举就会发生的。第一种，我称之为“同事关系网”（network of colleagues）。你身边有一大堆你“需要认识”的人——你需要和他们打交道、寒暄、见面、花时间、建立关系——这些人是你的同行，或是你工作上需要接触的人。

这是你的“职场人脉网”。你必须认识这些人，也确实认识他们，你甚至享受和他们在一起。但这些关系的目的，是你的工作、你的事业、你的金钱。第二种关系网，是你的“社交关系网”——和你一起玩的人、一起聚会的人、你有或可能有浪漫兴趣的人。

所以，这边是一群你一起玩、一起享乐的人——产出的是“开心”；那边是一群能为你带来事业发展和金钱回报的人——产出的是“成就”。这些关系都来得很快，但你在其中并没有付上“友谊”那种代价——别人对你也没有。这里几乎没有“牺牲的忠诚”，因为你根本就是为“好玩”和“有用”而来的；而那一种愿意在对方变得不那么“好玩”或“不那么有用”时仍然不离不弃的承诺，不在这些关系的设定之内。

更不用说这里几乎没有“脆弱的坦诚”。所以，你会在友谊上饥饿；你会在生命最关键的层面贫乏。你得不到唯有真朋友才能给你的东西。那我们怎么办？你需要一种力量，帮你克服在坦诚上的恐惧、在忠诚上的软弱。

我们到哪里去得到这样的力量，来成长为朋友，也让别人做我们的朋友？答案就在这里。

你知道亚里士多德很有智慧，写了很多关于友谊的东西。但他有一句话说得很清楚：你永远不可能和神做朋友。无论你怎么样与神或诸神发生关系，那都不可能叫“友谊”。他说这话的理由，是他认为所有友谊都必须发生在“社会地位相等”的人之间。他不相信在不平等的身份之间可以有真正的友谊。

因为友谊一定是建立在某种“共同性”的基础上——共同的兴趣、共同的热情、共同的所爱。而这通常发生在同一种文化、同一种族、同一个阶层、同等教育水平的人之间。所以，不可能有一种与“神”的关系会被称为“朋友”。

顺便说一句，这些年来我在很多场合和其他宗教的代表一起上台对谈。每当我试图谈到“我们可以与上帝成为朋友”的时候，几乎每一次，我都会被相当明确地指出——通常是相当礼貌，但也非常坚决地指出——这种说法在他们的宗教里是绝对不恰当的。在他们的传统中，从来不会用“朋友”来形容人与神的关系。那是把神拉低了，把神当“兄弟、哥们儿”。

然而，旧约已经给了我们一些暗示。出埃及记33章说：神与摩西面对面说话，好像人与朋友说话一样。雅各书2章说：亚伯拉罕——何等伟大的人物——被称为“神的朋友”。但等等，这怎么可能？亚里士多德不是说得很有道理吗？我们怎么可能和神有那种“脆弱的坦诚”和“牺牲的忠诚”的关系呢？朋友会变得脆弱，会为你忠诚地付出代价。那怎么会发生在神身上？听起来太荒唐了。

不，完全不是。你知道为什么。你也知道其他宗教绝不会宣称“神可以成为你的朋友”，但基督信仰可以——而且理直气壮地这样宣称。为什么？因为当神在耶稣基督里来到地上，并走向十字架，为我们的罪受死时，那正是耶稣自己在13节所说的“至大的爱”——「人为朋友舍命，人的爱心没有比这个大的。」

他不是泛泛而谈一个抽象原则，他在说第二天自己要做的事。十字架就是终极的友谊行动。你知道朋友总是让你可以走进他里面，对吧？看看十字架——还有什么比这更向你敞开的吗？他的双臂不仅是向你伸开着，而是“被钉”在展开的位置上。他还能怎样更脆弱、更坦诚地向你显明自己呢？

朋友不会在你需要的时候让你失望。那在忠诚、牺牲上，耶稣还能做得比十字架更多吗？在客西马尼园，他看见那些他要为之成就救赎的人——他的门徒——一个个背叛他、离开他、睡着，不久还要否认他。他知道，要么他替他们下到地狱，承担他们应得的一切审判，要么就失去他们。他选择了下地狱。

的确，有一位“朋友，比弟兄更亲密”；有一位朋友“时时爱我们”；有一位朋友，他的“伤痕是出于忠诚”——但在耶稣的身上，那不只是朋友带给我们的“责备之伤”，更是朋友为我们承担的“代赎之伤”。

那么，简单说，这就是“爱的经济学”。你从哪里得着那种力量——去接近人、向人敞开，即便可能受伤；去对人忠诚，即便对方可能让你失望？答案很简单，是“爱的经济学”。你看12节：「这是我的命令：你们要彼此相爱，像我爱你们一样。」耶稣说：「我要为你们舍命，把我的爱倾倒在你们身上。」

想像一下：如果你是一个极其富有的人，是一个“万亿富翁”。身边有几个人你很喜欢，他们有个创业点子，商业计划书马马虎虎，你也不是百分之百看好。但你还是会投钱给他们。为什么？因为你输得起，你喜欢他们，你想鼓励他们。

这就是我们在属灵上的处境。如果耶稣基督的友谊，是你心里真正的财富；如果那是你最深的满足，那么你就“输得起”。你可以“承担得起”在友谊上的风险。你可以向人敞开；你可以给出忠诚——因为你已经有那位终极的朋友，有那位爱你到极处的朋友。

好，最后我用三点应用来结束。

第一，我们需要把“友谊”重新放回到不同种族、不同阶层、不同国籍的人际关系中心。亚里士多德的确有观察到一个事实：通常友谊只发生在同一种族、同一个阶层、同一个教育水平的人之间。你在现实生活中也看得见，因为友谊的“引信”往往就是“共同点”：共同的文化、共同的兴趣、共同的所爱。

但你知道这对基督徒意味着什么吗？如果你是基督徒，而你遇见一个人与自己在种族上完全不同，阶层上完全不同，性别、国籍、政治立场都不同，但他和你有同样的“在基督里”的经历，对福音有同样的热情，对圣经有同样的渴慕——你知道这意味着什么吗？这意味着你真正有能力，与一个和你社会背景完全不同的人，建立深刻、滋养生命的友谊。

换句话说，我们必须用实际的生命，证明亚里士多德在这里错了。这也是为什么我的朋友唐·卡森会这样说：教会不是由“天然的朋友”组成，而是由“天然的敌人”组成。把我们联合在一起的，不是同样的教育背景、种族、收入、政治立场、国籍、口音、职业或类似的东西；基督徒聚在一起，是因为他们都被耶稣基督拯救。我们是一群“天然的敌人”，因着耶稣的缘故，被变成彼此相爱的朋友。基督徒的彼此相爱，是“社会上原本不相容的人之间的爱”。

你知道那是什么感觉吗？和一个在社会意义上与你完全不同的人，建立深刻的友谊？那是极其丰富的经验——而且在基督里，这是可能的。

第二，我们需要把“友谊”，带回男女之间的关系。我的意思是：在这座城市里，大体上，在这间教会里也大致如此，很多男人并不想真正与女人做朋友。他们要么远离女性，要么只追逐那些自己想约会、想发生性关系的女人。

如果你不是基督徒，我多少能理解这种做法：你要么保持距离，要么只靠近那些对你有吸引力的女人。但如果你是基督徒，你就没有理由继续这样做。问题在哪？如果房间里有十个女人，其中两个对你有吸引力，你就往那两个人那里挤，希望和她们发展关系，或许最后其中一个会变成你的朋友。这种做法不对。

更好的做法，是先“与这些基督里的姐妹做朋友”，让你周围的基督徒姐妹成为你的朋友。然后，如果在这些友谊中，你对其中一位产生了爱情，那你就更有理由相信，这份爱情有足够的厚度，可以托住一生的婚姻。不要继续现在这样：只去追逐你有感觉的女人，然后事后再看看有没有可能做朋友。不，要先去做朋友，再看神是否让你爱上其中一位——这才是健康的路。我知道，这样是行得通的。

所以，我们要在男女关系里恢复“友谊”的地位。在基督徒群体里，你有这个机会，是外面世界没有的。诚然，男女之间发展友谊往往不容易，但基督信仰给了你这个可能——让你有能力在友谊中跨越种族文化的鸿沟，也跨越性别的鸿沟。

第三，也是最后一点：你需要把“友谊”重新放回你与上帝关系的中心。很多人是基督徒，也相信有神，也大体上遵行神的命令，但他们没有真正照着耶稣在这里所说的——去“与神做朋友”。

耶稣说：「你们若遵行我所吩咐的，就是我的朋友了。」你看，他说：「如果你是我的朋友，你就会遵守我的命令；你就会常在我里面。」这是什么意思？他已经在十字架上向你完全敞开，为你牺牲。现在，轮到你了：你要“顺服他”。不要只在方便的时候顺服，要为他付上代价。你要选择把自己也置于“脆弱”的位置——说：「主啊，我不管我能不能明白你在做什么，不管我喜不喜欢，你既这样说，我就照做。」当你这样做时，你就开始真正成为他的朋友。

然后，你要“跟他说话”。一个安静的灵修时间，不应该只是你获得一些思想上的点子，或是列出一堆祈求的清单。读经应该是“听神说话”，是你感觉到他透过他的道来对你说话；祷告是你“回话”。你会不会常常有一种“他的同在”的实际感受？你会不会特意为此预留时间？

没有什么能替代这种经历，而你极其需要它。为什么？因为我们都像弗兰肯斯坦的怪物。你知道吗？我们的自我形象是一堆相互矛盾的碎片缝在一起。你的父亲不喜欢你，但有另外一个人喜欢你；又有某个人跟你分手，说了很多可怕的话。你根本不知道要相信关于自己什么是真实的。在某些方面，你对自己能力有过高的评估；在另外一些地方，你又充满羞愧和自责。你是一个“怪物式的拼凑体”。

你需要的是一种“压倒一切的爱”，一份能为你定下“你是谁”的爱。一位爱你、对你说：「这才是你的真实身份」的朋友——一位终极的朋友。

从这个意义上说，我们都像那个弗兰肯斯坦的怪物，在森林里摸索前行，一边走一边呼喊：「朋友，朋友」，心里深知：如果我能找到我心一直在寻找的那位终极的朋友，我就能真正成为“我自己”。耶稣就是那一位。让我们祷告。

父啊，谢谢你，向我们伸出你最关键的那种关系——你愿意与我们成为朋友。你也借着这份友谊，赐给我们力量，在这个文化并不鼓励友谊的处境里，去建立真正的友谊。你的福音赋予我们这样的能力。求你帮助我们，倚靠你做我们终极的朋友，在这个群体、在这座城市、在我们的生命中，建立许多新的友谊，使我们越来越像你的儿子耶稣基督——他为朋友舍命。奉他的名祷告，阿们。

今天，提姆·凯勒要展开讲解圣灵的一种果子，帮助我们看见，从“努力做一个好人”到“从内而外真正被改变”意味着什么。今晚的经文来自约翰福音15章6到15节：

“人若不常在我里面，就像枝子丢在外面枯干，人拾起来，扔在火里烧了。你们若常在我里面，我的话也常在你们里面，凡你们所愿意的，祈求就给你们成就。

你们多结果子，我父就因此得荣耀，你们也就是我的门徒了。父怎样爱我，我也怎样爱你们；你们要常在我的爱里。你们若遵守我的命令，就常在我的爱里，正如我遵守了我父的命令，常在他的爱里。

这些事我已经对你们说了，是要叫我的喜乐存在你们心里，并叫你们的喜乐可以满足。

你们要彼此相爱，像我爱你们一样，这就是我的命令。人为朋友舍命，人的爱心没有比这个更大的。你们若遵行我所吩咐的，就是我的朋友了。

以后我不再称你们为仆人，因为仆人不知道主人所做的事；我乃称你们为朋友，因为我从我父所听见的一切，已经都告诉你们了。”

一个被神的恩典和圣灵大能所改变的心，它那些超自然改变的记号，经典地列在加拉太书五章22到23节，也就是所谓“圣灵的果子”：仁爱、喜乐、和平、忍耐、恩慈、良善，等等。每一周，我们都会取其中一个特质来思想，好叫我们在自己生命中，能够更多经历这种超自然的改变。

那么今晚，我们来到的这一项，是“恩慈”这个属灵果子。而每当传道人讲到圣灵的果子，讲到这一项的时候，其实都会遇到一个很大的挑战。为什么呢？因为新约中翻译成“恩慈”的那个希腊字，本身有一个非常宽广的含义范围。不幸的是，它在不同的语境下，可以被翻译成“合宜的”“讨人喜悦的”“诚实的”，有时又是“有怜悯的”。

那么，如果一个字的“语义范围”这么宽，你要怎么样来讲“恩慈”呢？答案是，你不能抽象地讲。你必须去看一种关系，一种同时把这些特质都结合在一起的关系。而这种把这些特质都合在一起的关系，就是“朋友关系”。

所以今晚我们要做的，就是来思想“友谊”。当然，不是说没有“超自然改变的心”就完全不会有朋友；但我想我们会看到，福音给了你一种友谊，以及支撑这种友谊的资源，是无与伦比的。

现在，电影史上对于友谊力量最具标志性的呈现之一——标志性到常常被拿来戏仿——就是老版“弗兰肯斯坦”系列中的第二部：由鲍里斯·卡洛夫主演的《科学怪人的新娘》。在那部电影里，有这样一个场景：怪物（Frankenstein 的怪物）跌跌撞撞地闯进森林中的一间小屋，屋里只有一个人住着——一位贫穷年老的盲人。

当这位盲人来到门口迎接怪物时，他当然看不见对方的样子，所以并不害怕；但他感觉到对方不会说话，于是就说：“我们两个都带着残缺。我不能看见，而你不能说话。也许，”他说，“我们可以做朋友。”于是他把怪物迎进屋里，以友善对待他，不断称呼他为“朋友”，叫他“我的朋友”。

有一刻，这位盲人跪在怪物身边开始祷告。他祷告说：“我们的父啊，我感谢你，在你大怜悯中，你怜悯了我极深的孤独，如今在夜的寂静之中，你把你的两个孤独儿女聚在一起，赐给我一位朋友，作我眼目的光，在我患难之时作我的安慰。阿们。”

有一位作家在评论这一段时说：在这个极其震撼的场景里，怪物看见隐士（这位盲人）在祷告的最后崩溃痛哭。怪物也流下眼泪，怜悯地伸手安慰这位哭泣的人，轻轻拍着他的背，表示安慰。他们两个人都共同需要一种东西——人类的友谊。

在这段戏缓慢淡出的镜头中，最后一个消失在画面里的物件，是一幅发光的基督十字架。但当然，如你们中许多人可能知道的——你也可以随时去 YouTube 上找这一段来看——最后发生的却是：村民来到小屋，看见怪物，就攻击这间小屋，并点火焚烧。这个段落的最后画面，是弗兰肯斯坦的怪物从火焰和浓烟中踉跄走出，一边走一边喊：“朋友！朋友！”带着恳求的语气，却再也没有任何回应。

重点是什么呢？没有什么比友谊更能使人“成为人”，也没有什么比友谊更具改变生命的力量。为什么？怎么会这样？

我们来看这段经文——这是整个圣经中关于友谊最经典的一段经文。事实上，我认为在所有宗教文学里面，这段关于友谊的经文都是独一无二的，没有任何别的文本能与之相比。为什么这样说？因为它首先告诉我们友谊的本质或特征；其次，告诉我们友谊是如何被“打造出来”的，也就是怎样建立友谊；最后，告诉我们友谊的力量从何而来。

第一，先看友谊的本质或特征。关于这段经文，有一个很有意思的地方——刚才读经只是给你们一个“样本”。在约翰福音十五章一开头，耶稣谈到他与门徒之间的关系，是用“葡萄树与枝子”这个比喻来说的。他说：“我是真葡萄树，你们是枝子。”这是一个谈论关系的比喻，对吧？但它表达的是一种深度的联合，因为葡萄树和枝子共享同一个生命，共享同一条生命的联结。

但到了大约第九节左右，耶稣开始换一个比喻。祂不再称他们为“我的枝子”，而开始称他们为“我的朋友”。然而，这两个比喻其实紧密相连，等一下我们会看到。在这两个比喻当中，都出现了同一个动词，就是“常在”（remain）——当耶稣说他们是枝子时用这个词，当祂称他们为朋友时也用这个词。

不过，“葡萄树与枝子”这个意象，和“朋友”这个意象之间的重叠，比你想象的要多得多。因为在圣经中，友谊常常是这样被描述的：申命记13章6节里有一句几乎像是顺口带过的话：“你同母的兄弟，或是你儿女，或是你怀中的妻，或是与你相亲的朋友，好像你性命的……”——中文和合本这里翻成“如同你性命的朋友”。

然后在撒母耳记上18章那里，圣经说：“约拿单的心与大卫的心相契。”——直译就是“约拿单的魂与大卫的魂紧紧相连”。

大卫的魂，约拿单就爱大卫如同自己的性命。——“魂与魂被编织在一起”的这个意象，就是圣经里形容友谊的画面。我想请你好好想一想：这是什么意思？

“魂被编织在一起”？这远不只是思想上的一致。你也许有个同事，工作上意见一致，但这还不够。坦白说，这甚至比单纯的性吸引还要多得多——不仅仅是身体的连结，也不仅仅是观点的连结。

“魂被编织在一起”意味着，你们有共同的所爱，有共同的激情、共同的信念、共同的兴趣。有几篇关于友谊的经典文章你可以去读一读：你可以上网搜拉尔夫·沃尔多·爱默生（Ralph Waldo Emerson）写的那篇精彩短文《友谊》，还有 C.S. 路易斯在《四种爱》这本书里关于“友爱”（友情）的那一章。

爱默生说，朋友不会老问：“你爱我吗？”他们更会问的是：“你也看见同样的真理吗？你在乎的，是否也是我在乎的那个真理？”友谊萌芽时典型的表达，大概会是这样的一句话：“什么？你也是？我一直以为只有我这样。”——友谊就是这样开始的。

C.S. 路易斯是这样说的：虽然一个人可以同时与同一个对象拥有爱欲之爱（eros）和友谊之爱（philia），但在某些方面，“恋爱”却与“友谊”极不相像。恋人总是彼此面对，谈论的主要是“我们之间的爱”；朋友却不太谈论他们之间的“友谊”，他们通常是肩并肩站着，被某个共同的兴趣所吸引。

正因为如此，那些“可怜的人”——也就是只是一心“想要朋友”的人——往往反而交不到朋友。拥有朋友的前提，就是你心里真正在乎的，是“某样朋友以外的东西”。

如果有人问你：“你也看见和我一样的真理吗？”而你坦诚的回答却是：“其实我并不太在乎什么真理，我只是想要你做我的朋友。”那样的话，真正的友谊就永远开始不了，因为友谊无所依附、无所围绕。那些心中什么都没有的人，就什么都不能分享；那些人生没有方向、无处可去的人，也就不可能有“同行的伙伴”。

这在说什么呢？基本上就是说：朋友是那些你遇见的人，他们与你有共同的兴趣、共同的激情、共同的信念，你们一接触，就立刻感觉到一种合一。

这也意味着，首先，朋友是“被发现”的。箴言27章有一句话说：“朋友的劝戒本是甘美。”（有的译本作“甜美”。）但原文希伯来语用的字，其实就是“甜”（sweet）。理解圣经里的很多词，有一个难处是你必须回到当时的语境去看。那时候的世界里，厨师是没办法“把东西做甜”的。他们当时所在的地方没有糖——圣经写作的那些地方、那些年代都没有。你只能“发现甜味”：有一些食物本身就天生是甜的，但人没办法凭自己的手艺“制造甜味”。

所以，当圣经说朋友的劝戒是“甘美的”“甜的”时，说的不是你可以“调配出来”的东西，而是你“发现”到的东西。因此，友谊开始的方式就是那句：“什么，你也是？我还以为只有我一个呢。”——“你也喜欢那部电影？你也喜欢那种音乐？你也喜欢那样的书？你也是？”共同的信念、共同的纽带——这就是开始。

但这只是一个开始而已。接下来第二步，我们必须继续往前，看到：你要如何把这样的开始，锻造成真正的友谊？

所以，当我说“朋友是被发现的”，不要把这句话推得太远。因为与一个可能成为你朋友的人之间，总是会有某种最初的合一感——你一下子就对得上电、看见了。但你们两个人同时也是人，这意味着你们都是有缺陷的，而且彼此也都不一样。因此，你永远不可能绕开这样一个难题：你若要真正拥抱一个“和你不同的人”，你就要付上代价。

那是一个跟你不一样的人——尽管你们有一些相似，却也同样有很多不同。拥抱“他者”（the other）是极其代价高昂的。而要把一个“潜在的朋友”变成一个“一生的朋友”——这是人生中最美好的事物之一——需要付出努力，特别是两种努力、两种操练。

这两种操练都在这段经典经文里。耶稣在说“你们是我的朋友”的时候，正是在向我们展示这两件事——这两种操练，就是把一个“可能成为朋友的人”变成“真正的朋友”的方式。而这两种操练是：脆弱的敞开（坦诚透明），以及牺牲的忠诚。

“脆弱的敞开”，你在第15节里看到；“牺牲的忠诚”，你在第13节里看到。

先看第一样：脆弱的敞开（坦诚透明）。这节经文非常惊人：“你们若遵行我所吩咐的，就是我的朋友了。我不再称你们为仆人，因为仆人不知道主人所做的事；我乃称你们为朋友，因我从我父所听见的一切，已经都告诉你们了。”

你看，老板和朋友之间的差别是什么？老板会说：“去做这个。”——他不需要向你解释为什么，因为那是你的工作。军官会说：“执行命令。”——他也不需要向你解释原因，因为你作为士兵的职责，就是照命令去做。

但耶稣说：“我对你们不是只这样对待。我不是只把你们当作仆人，而是当作朋友。”朋友会彼此说“心里的事”。朋友彼此敞开。朋友让你走进他的里面，让你看见他真正的样子——卸下伪装、卸下“妆容”，让你知道他真实在经历什么、真实在感觉什么。

诗篇25篇14节有一句有趣的话。如果你去看不同中文或英文译本，有的翻成：“耶和华与敬畏他的人亲密。”（或：“耶和华把他的奥秘指示敬畏他的人。”）有的译本则翻成：“耶和华与敬畏他的人为友。”为什么译者拿不定主意呢？因为那里那一个希伯来字，既可以译成“奥秘、秘密”，也可以译成“朋友”。你知道为什么吗？同学们？因为朋友就是彼此说“秘密”的人；如果你从来不这样做，你其实还称不上是真正的朋友。

在友谊里面，会有一种脆弱性，也会有一种透明性。你或许会问，那具体意味着什么？那我就再往深一点讲：在友谊里，“透明”意味着你有能力，好好地给予并接受批评。

当然，每个人都会给出或接受一些批评；但朋友是不一样的人——他们是能够“好好地给予和接受批评”的人。这就是为什么圣经里会有这样的经文——箴言是谈这类事最集中的地方。箴言27章6节（和合本）说：“朋友加的伤痕出于忠诚。”——旧译是：“朋友的伤痕是出于忠诚。”是不是很棒的一句话？

又比如箴言29章5节说：“谄媚邻舍的，就是为他的脚设网罗。”如果你只是奉承、拍马屁，其实你根本不是他的朋友，因为那是对他最糟糕的事——你任凭他活在一个膨胀的自我认知当中，以为自己能做的远比实际更多；这对他来说是极其有害的。

“朋友加的伤痕出于忠诚。”——朋友不会彼此奉承。这当然就是前面那句我们刚提过的箴言27章6节。

还有那句很有名的箴言27章17节：“铁磨铁，磨出刃来；朋友相感，也是如此。”换句话说，很多时候，你有一些关于自己必须要听见、却一点也不想听的话。而你不会从一个受过训练的咨询师那里听进去这些话；你也不会从家人那里听进去；你更不会从同事那里听进去。

但如果你有一位与你相交已久、值得信赖的老朋友，你就不能轻易把他“划掉”、把他说的话当成“不懂你、也不关心你”的人。朋友是那些真正了解你、也真正关心你的人。他们不是因为“不得不跟你在一起”才和你相处——不像同事，工作把你们绑在一起；也不像家人，血缘把你们绑在一起。朋友是那些选择跟你在一起的人。

往往只有那些相交已久的朋友，才能对你说出你最需要听到的那些话。如果你生命里没有多少长期的朋友，那就会有许多关于你自己的事情，你这一生都不会听见——而你也就不会在那些地方成长。

所以，“脆弱的敞开”是第一件事。这非常不容易，这是你必须向一个“潜在的朋友”刻意加上的一种操练，使他成为“真正的朋友”。

第二，则是“牺牲的忠诚”。有一个细节我觉得非常耐人寻味，你可以在经文里看见：那就是“常在”（remain）这个字，耶稣不仅用在“枝子”的比喻里，也用在“朋友”的语境中。

经文第6节说：“人若不常在我里面，就像枝子丢在外面枯干。”这是什么意思？祂在说，你不能把枝子晚上折下来、第二天再插回去，就指望它还能活。枝子必须一直连在葡萄树上；你一旦把它折下来，它就再不可能有那样的联合。

但稍后，耶稣又说：“你们要常在我的爱里。”也就是说，“你们要常在我的友谊里。”这意味着什么？意味着友谊就是“常在”，就是“留下来”，就是在风雨中仍然与人同在——与人共度顺境与逆境。

诗篇能够极大地塑造你亲近神的方式。连耶稣自己，都倚靠诗篇来面对一切处境，甚至包括死亡。

在提姆和凯西·凯勒所写的《耶稣之诗：365天诗篇灵修》这本书里，你会发现贯穿诗篇全卷的每日灵修阅读，并带着新鲜的圣经洞见。如果你还没有固定的灵修习惯，这本书会是一个很好的起点；如果你已经有一段稳定的读经祷告时间，那么透过阅读与祷告诗篇，你可以把自己最深的情绪和问题，带到神面前，经历与祂更深层次的亲密。

这意味着什么呢？一方面，在最实际的层面上，朋友——而这真的很难——会为彼此“挪出时间”。在今天这个时代，为彼此腾出时间实在不容易；因此，单单愿意为某个人这样做，本身就已经表明了一种承诺，不是吗？

但这不只如此，它还意味着：即便对方变得难相处，或正在经历极大的困难，即便从这段关系中你暂时得不到什么“好处”，你仍然与他同在，陪他走下去——这才是朋友。这也就是为什么会有那些关于友谊的名言箴言。比如箴言17章17节说：“朋友乃时常亲爱。”

又比如箴言18章24节说：“有朋友比弟兄更亲密。”——就是那句很有名的，“有一朋友比弟兄更亲密”。

所以，总结一下，什么是朋友？朋友是那种“永远让你走得进来的人”，也是那种“绝不在关键时刻让你失望的人”。永远让你走得进来——那是脆弱的敞开与透明；绝不让你失望——那是牺牲的忠诚与恒久的同在。

顺便说一句，这也意味着，你不可能在 Facebook 或 MySpace 上拥有“五百个朋友”。我知道那些人被平台称作“好友”，但他们并不符合圣经的定义。

举个例子：当先知拿单去见大卫的时候，大卫整个王国和他属灵的命定都摇摇欲坠；拿单进去，对他说：“你就是那人！”——你还记得那一幕吗？在撒母耳记下第12章，我们去年有一篇讲道专门讲到这一段。拿单走进去，对大卫说：“你做了什么。你犯罪了，你背叛了你的王位。”

你生命中有没有一个“拿单”，能这样对你说话？这绝对不可能在 Facebook 上完成——那必须是面对面的事。否则你根本不会听进去。

朋友，就是那种“永远让你走得进来、也从不在关键时刻让你失望”的人。你有没有把这一套标准，应用在身边那些“有可能成为朋友的人”身上，好让他们成为真正的朋友？

不过，我们还没讲完。原因是这样：我们已经看了友谊的本质，也看了它的力量，看了它怎么被“锻造”出来。但接下来的问题是：你从哪里得到力量去活出这样的友谊？

因为，有很多东西是在和你作对的。首先，就拿“脆弱的敞开”和“无条件、恒常的忠诚”这两件事来说：它们都令人感到害怕。想象别人这样对我们，挺让人兴奋；但要想象自己这样去对别人，就一点也不令人兴奋了。

因为“敞开的透明”让人害怕；“忠诚的恒常”会消耗人的精力。而我们生活的文化，无论是在它传递的信息，还是在它塑造的社会结构上，都在方方面面阻碍你发展真正的友谊。你知道这一点的。

在像纽约这样的城市，有两种关系是几乎不费吹灰之力就自然而然形成的。第一种，我称之为“同事关系网络”：有一大群人是你“需要认识”的——你需要一起社交、寒暄、见面、花时间、建立一点友好关系——因为他们是你的工作伙伴，或是在你的工作领域里，你“需要认识”的人。这就是你的职场人脉网络，你必须认识这些人。而你确实也认识这些人，也享受与他们的互动，但这一切关系的主要目的，都是你的工作、事业、收入。

第二种关系网络，是“社交网络”：你和那些一起参加聚会、一起玩乐的人之间的关系；你和那些你有浪漫兴趣，或可能发展浪漫兴趣的人的关系。这一边，是和你一起玩乐的人——这里的“产出”是“好玩”；那一边，是你拓展人脉的关系网——这里的“产出”是事业发展和金钱。

这些东西会很自然地发生，但在其中没有这种“牺牲的忠诚”。你不会在这些关系里有这种深投入，因为社交关系的前提就是：这些人要“好玩”；而人脉关系的前提就是：这些人要“有用”。

这些关系当中，那些人之所以在你身边，是因为“他们对你有用”。在这样的网路里，不会有“牺牲的忠诚”；在这样的互动里，你也不会愿意那样深度地投入。因为社交关系的逻辑是：这些人要“好玩”；而人脉关系的逻辑是：这些人要“有用”。

所以，在这样的结构里，“牺牲的忠诚”根本没有位置，“坦诚的透明”更是完全缺席。结果就是，你在友谊上会严重饥荒，生命严重贫乏，得不到只有真朋友才能给你的那些东西。

那我们该怎么办？你需要一种力量，来胜过你那种与生俱来的恐惧——那种面对“坦诚透明”时自然产生的害怕；你也需要一种力量，来顶住那种想到“恒久忠诚”时本能流露的软弱与退缩。你需要一股力量，帮助你胜过自己的惧怕和软弱。

那我们从哪里得到这样一种力量，去做真正的朋友，并把他人塑造成我们该有的那种朋友？答案就在这里。

你知道吗？亚里士多德其实非常有智慧，他也写过不少关于友谊的内容。但他所说的一件事是：人永远不可能和“神”做朋友。无论你怎么和“神”或“众神”建立关系，你都不可能以“朋友”的方式与神相处。

他之所以这么说，是因为他认为，所有的友谊，都必须发生在“社会地位相等”的人之间。若两者没有相同程度的社会身份、权力、教育程度等等，他就认为不可能形成真正的友谊。因为友谊正是建立在那种“被发现出来的共同点”之上——共同的兴趣、共同的所爱、共同的激情——而这些通常发生在同一文化、同一种族、同一阶层、同一教育水平的人身上。

所以，他认为，人不可能和神之间建立被称作“友谊”的关系。

实际上，多年来我曾多次与其他宗教的代表一起上台，参与对谈。当我一提到“我们可以以朋友的身份来认识神”时，对方几乎无一例外——通常是很客气，但语气也很坚决——会告诉我：用这种方式谈论神，是极不恰当的。在他们的宗教里，从来不会用这样的语言来形容神，这样说是把神“拉低”了——神不可能成为你的“哥们儿”、你的“好伙伴”、你的“朋友”。

然而，旧约里却已经给出了预告：出埃及记33章说：“耶和华与摩西面对面说话，好像人与朋友说话一般。”雅各书第2章也说：“亚伯拉罕——何等伟大的一位人——竟被称为‘神的朋友’。”

可是等一下，这怎么可能？难道亚里士多德说得不对吗？

聪明人。我的意思是，上帝怎么可能变得脆弱呢？

朋友就是会变得脆弱。而上帝怎么可能以牺牲的方式向你忠诚呢？这太荒唐了。不是的，一点也不荒唐，你心里其实知道这不是荒唐。

现在你也知道，我知道，其他任何宗教都不敢说上帝可以成为你的朋友，但基督教敢，而且能够这样说。原因在这里：因为当上帝在耶稣基督里来到世上，并走上十字架，为我们的罪而死、付上代价的时候，那正是耶稣自己在 13 节所说的——友谊的终极行动。那是“最大的爱莫过于此，为朋友舍命”的极致体现。他不是在泛泛而谈。他说的就是事实，因为第二天，他就要这样做了。

十字架是终极的——听好了——十字架是友谊的终极行动。你知道朋友总是向你敞开自己吗？看看十字架吧。他还能向你多敞开一些呢？

他的双臂不只是向你伸开，而是被钉开了。他还能变得多么脆弱、多么透明呢？而朋友永远不会让你失望。他还能有多忠诚呢？

他还能有多牺牲呢？他还能有多忠心呢？他还能有多忠诚到愿意上十字架呢？你知道吗，在客西马尼园里，他看见所有那些他要为之成就赦免的人，他那些所谓的门徒，他们正在出卖他、离弃他。

他们在他身边却睡着了。他们马上要不认他了。而他知道，他要么为他们下到地狱里去，承担他们应得的一切；要么就失去他们。于是他选择下到地狱。有一位朋友比弟兄更亲密。有一位终极的朋友，在任何时候都爱你。

也有一位终极的朋友，他的“伤痕是忠诚的”。还记得那句箴言吗？“朋友加的伤痕是出于忠诚。”但对耶稣基督来说，这些不是朋友加给你的伤痕，而是朋友为你、为我所承受的伤痕。你看，这其实很简单，是爱的经济学。

你从哪里得到力量，去向人伸出手，与人敞开，明知可能会受伤；去对人忠诚，明知可能被辜负？这很简单，是爱的经济学。你看，第 12 节说：

“这是我的命令：你们要彼此相爱，像我爱你们一样。”——我正在为你们舍命，我正在为你们倾倒我的爱。

这非常简单。如果你是一个极其富有的人，你是个万亿富翁，身边有几个人是你喜欢的，他们有个投资想法，商业计划还算可以，但你知道，你并不是完全有把握。你还是会投资他们。为什么？因为你承担得起。你喜欢他们，你想鼓励他们，而且你承担得起亏掉那点钱。这正是这里的情形。

如果耶稣基督的友谊是把你心填满的那件事，你就承担得起向别人敞开自己。你承担得起去冒险，因为所有的友谊本身就是一种冒险。你承担得起，因为你已经拥有那位终极的朋友，和朋友终极的爱。好了，现在让我在三个方面作应用。三个方面。

第一，我们需要把“友谊”的概念带回到不同种族、不同阶层、不同国籍的人彼此之间的关系中心。亚里士多德说得没错，一般来说，友谊只会发生在同一种族的人之间。你看得见：同一个阶层，同样受过教育的人之间，你看得见，因为友谊的“点火器”，可以说，友谊的原材料，是某种共同的纽带、共同的信念、共同的热情、共同的兴趣。但你意识到这对基督徒意味着什么资源吗？

如果你是基督徒，而你遇见一个在种族上完全不同、阶层上完全不同、性别不同、国籍不同、政治立场也不同的人，但他在耶稣基督里的经历却与你相同。他对福音有同样的热情，对圣经有同样的兴趣和热情。你知道这意味着什么吗？你有能力与那些在社会属性上和你完全不同的人建立深刻而丰富的友谊。换句话说，我们必须彻底向亚里士多德证明他在这一点上错了。

这就是为什么我的朋友唐·卡森这样说：教会不是由天生的朋友组成，而是由“天然的敌人”组成的。把我们连在一起的，不是共同的

教育、共同的种族、共同的收入水平、共同的政治立场、共同的国籍、共同的口音、共同的工作，或任何类似的东西。基督徒聚在一起，是因为他们被耶稣基督拯救了。我们是一群“天生的敌人”，却被变成彼此相爱的朋友——为着耶稣的缘故。基督徒的爱，是社会上彼此不相容的人之间的互相相爱。

你知道与一个在社会属性上与你完全不同的人拥有一段深刻的友谊是什么感觉吗？那是极其丰富的，而且这是可能的。所以，让我们把友谊带回到跨种族、跨阶层的关系中来。这是第一点。

第二点，我们更需要把友谊带回到男女之间的关系里。我的意思是——

大体上在这座城市里，大体上甚至在这间教会里，男人并不想和女人做朋友。他们要么远离女人，要么就是想和女人谈恋爱，只接近那些他们想与之约会、发生性关系的对象。现在，如果你不是基督徒，我多少还能理解你若是一个男人，要么远离女人，要么只接近那些你在浪漫意义上感兴趣的女人。但如果你是基督徒，你就没有借口了。我来告诉你问题出在哪里。

假设这里有十个女人，其中有两个在你看来比较有吸引力，于是你奔着她们去，试着和她们发展关系。也许其中一个最后真的能成为你的朋友，如果你够“幸运”的话。最好的做法是什么呢？是先去和这些女人建立友谊，先去和你周围的基督徒姐妹们交朋友，然后如果你爱上了其中一个，那时你才能信得过这种爱足够坚固，可以建造一生之久的婚姻。千万别继续你现在正在做的事：先去追那些你觉得有吸引力的女人，然后也许再把其中一两个“升级”为朋友。不。先去和女人、特别是基督徒姐妹交朋友，然后再看看自己会不会爱上其中任何一位。

这样才行。我知道。我们需要把友谊带回到男女之间的关系里。这是在基督徒群体中你所拥有、而这个世界其他地方没有的一个机会。因为确实，男女之间建立友谊有时候是很不容易的，但基督教给了你

同样的能力，使你能够建立那种不仅跨越种族、文化藩篱，也跨越性别藩篱的友谊。但第三点——

你需要把“友谊”带回到你与上帝的关系中心。很多很多人是基督徒，他们相信上帝，也大体上顺服上帝，但他们并没有真正做到耶稣在这里所说的——与上帝成为朋友。耶稣说：“你们若是我的朋友，就必遵行我的命令。”你看见了吗？“你们若是我的朋友，就要常在我里面。”那是什么意思呢？就是说，他在十字架上已经向你变得脆弱，为你牺牲。现在，第一步，你要顺服他。不只是方便的时候才顺服，要顺服他。

你现在要学着牺牲。你要学着变得脆弱。你要愿意“上场拼到底”。你要毫无保留地说：“我要照你所说的去做；我要行你的旨意，无论我是否明白，无论我是否喜欢。”这时，你才开始成为一位朋友。然后，你要和他说话。灵修、安静时间——在那里面读经、祷告——不应该只是拿到一些观念、提出一些祈求。查经应该是聆听上帝，是带着一种觉悟：他正在向你说话，借着他的话语对你说话。祷告应该是向上帝说回话。你是否经历过他的同在？这种事会经常发生吗？你会为此留出时间吗？世上没有任何东西能与之相比。这就是你所需要的。

让我告诉你为什么你如此需要它。

我们都像弗兰肯斯坦造出来的怪物，你知道的。你的自我形象是由一堆彼此矛盾的东西缝缀拼接在一起的。你的父亲不喜欢你，但某个人喜欢过你；又有某个人甩了你，并对你说了那些可怕的话。你根本不知道该相信关于自己的哪些评价。在某些方面，你对自己的某些能力评价过高，而在另一些方面，你又对自己过分懊悔、过度羞愧。你就是一个“弗兰肯斯坦式”的怪物。

你需要的是一种“压倒性的”爱——一种主宰一切的爱。有一个人，他的爱能医治你，对你说：“这才是你是谁。”你需要一位伟大、终极的朋友。

因此，我们都像那个弗兰肯斯坦的怪物，在森林里摸索着前行，一边说：

“我知道，只要能找到我心中寻找的那位终极的朋友，我就能真正成为我自己。”——耶稣，就是那一位。他就在这里。我们一起祷告。

天父，谢谢你，把我们最需要的那种友谊赐给我们——就是与你自己做朋友的那种友谊。也谢谢你，把力量赐给我们，使我们能在生活中建造友谊——而我们的文化其实并不帮助我们这样做，却是你的福音使我们有能力做到。

我们祈求，你帮助我们建基在你朋友般的爱之上，凭着那份能力，在这个群体、在这座城市、在我们的生命中，塑造许许多多新的友谊，使我们越来越像你的儿子耶稣基督——那位为朋友舍命的主。奉他的名祷告，阿们。
