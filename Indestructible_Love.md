## English Transcript / 英文原文

today's message, Tim Keller explores the human condition through stories in the Bible,  uncovering what Scripture says about sin and why it's the only explanation deep enough  to face the truth about ourselves. I'm going to read you from Isaiah chapter 49. I'm going to read verses 8 down to 16. It's  in your bulletin. I'm going to read to verse 16.

This is what the Lord says. In the time  of my favor, I will answer you and in the time of day of salvation, I will help you. I will keep  you and I will make you to be a covenant for the people to restore the land and to re assign its  desolate inheritances to say to the captives, come out and to those in darkness be free. They will  feed beside the roads and find pasture on every barren hill. They will neither hunger nor thirst,  nor will the desert heat or the sun beat upon them.

He who has compassion on them will guide  them and lead them beside springs of water. I will turn all my mountains into roads and my highways  will be raised up. See, they will come from afar, some from the north from this west, some from  the region of Aswan. Shout for joy, oh heavens, rejoice so earth, burst into song, oh mountains,  for the Lord comforts his people and will have compassion on his afflicted ones. But Zion said, the Lord has forsaken me, the Lord has forgotten me.

Can a mother forget  the baby at her breast had had no compassion on the child she has born? Though she may forget, I will not forget you. See, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands. Your walls are ever before me. Let's end there.

This is God's Word. Now, if you've been coming over the weeks, you know, this is the actually end of a series on what  the Bible has to say about what's wrong with the human heart, what's wrong with the human race,  what the Bible calls sin. And if you're part of this series, you need to know that if you've  been following this series, this is the ultimate cure. Well, we actually have here, let me remind you  this when we've been in Isaiah for a while, what we have here is something written to people who are  going to face our facing exile. The Jews had Jerusalem destroyed.

That's the reason why there's  discussion about Zion's wall. Zion was the hill on which the temple was built. And therefore,  the word Zion can mean the city of Jerusalem. It sometimes can mean the temple, but the point is  that when the Babylonian Empire came and besieged Jerusalem and destroyed it, everything was torn down. The walls of Jerusalem were torn down.

The temple was torn down. The people were sent into captivity. And what Isaiah is giving us is a prophecy from the Lord to the people. And here he's asking,  here he's answering the question. And the question is going to be, how can we face this?

What are  you going to do about this? Now, up to verse 13 and we didn't print all of it in this chapter,  we have a typical theological discourse. Isaiah, through Isaiah, God is saying what he's going to do  about it. And verses 1 to 8, we start with verse 8, but verses 1 to 8 of chapter 49 talks about  the servant, this mysterious figure who's going to come, the servant of the Lord. And what he's  going to do is he's going to suffer.

And as a result of the suffering, we say in verses 9 to 12,  he's going to gather a new people. He's going to create a new community of people from the east  and the west, pardon not from the east actually, from the desert over there, but from the north and  the west and the south. And there are going to be people who have been brought out of darkness,  people who have been set free. And so because of his suffering, he's going to create a new  community. And then lastly, when you get to verse 13, which is the climax, this enormous theological  discourse, we're told here that what God is going to do through the servant and in this group  of people, is going to be a such power that is going to actually redeem all of the world.

Because  when you see here, we see shop for joy or heavens, or earth person to song or mountains,  God is actually going to renew all of creation. Whatever God does is going to be so powerful that  all of creation, the heavens and the earth is everything's going to be renewed. Everything's going  to be brought into some kind of blossom. And that's what God is saying. He's going to do.

It's  sweeping. It's huge. It's immense. And it's too sweeping and it's too huge and it's too immense. Because verse 14 just hits you between the eyes.

If you're reading along, if you're reading through  the chapter, in a way, I can see this in a way that you can't because I didn't print you the whole  chapter here. But if you move on through the chapter, here's God talking about, I'm going to do  this. And I'm going to do that. And this is, of course, at least the Stoxology where he's calling  nature to blossom into praise God. And suddenly verse 14 comes along.

And what is verse 14? What is it? The people listening to God respond. And what do they say? Wow, no, what do they say?

Look,  I'm still depressed. Here's God saying, oh, look at all the things I'm going to do. And what it says,  but Zion said, the Lord has forsaken me. The Lord has forgotten me. Now what you have here  is God giving this theological discourse to the people.

And the people responding by saying  that, say, saying this, the realities of my present life are overwhelming such remote, abstract,  distant, lofty promises and claims. All your theology. All I know is Zion's broken down. My life  is broken down. How could you let this happen to me?

In other words, here's God giving this great  theological discourse. And the people say, I'm still depressed. You forsaken me. You forgot me. I don't even know what you're talking about all this heavens and earth.

I don't know who this  servant is. I don't know what's going on here. And therefore what we have is industrial strength  despondency, the human heart. It's very hard to make the human heart feel happy and loved. I mean, some of us are worse than others.

Let's face it. But basically here, listen, you tell a human  heart. You're a disgrace. You're trash. You're despicable.

And you never forget those. You never  forget statements like that. Never in your whole life. But you tell a human heart, you're wonderful,  you're great. I like you.

And you need that. It fades so fast. Five minutes later, you need to hear  it again. Or you forget it. The human heart falls into respondents in spite of claims of love.

And what does God do? We have here. It's very interesting. In verse 14, we see someone saying  in spite of all these great claims, I'm still depressed. You don't love me.

I don't feel left by you. I don't feel that you're committed to me. And we see how God deals with a despondent heart. And that's pretty instructive. How does God deal with it?

How does God deal with a person who's  despondent in despair? First of all, let me show you two general principles and then three specific  principles, two general ways in which God works with a despondent depressed person. And then three  very specific things that he joins us to do. First, there's two real general principles and they go  like this. First of all, God stops.

That may not be as easy for you to see unless you read in the  whole chapter, but God sees on his way. He's talking about things. And he's actually got, he's,  verses 1 to 13 is really a wonderful, a wonderful, there's the structure of this discourse is  wonderful. And I'm not even going to talk about it here tonight, because I don't think that's what  we're going to, we're not going to dwell on that. But he actually talks about three great stages in  history of salvation.

He's moving from the cross to a new community to a new creation, from  cross to community to new creation. It's really wonderful. And then suddenly he looks down and he  says, any questions, I mean, this is like it like sure. He's I'm going on to say any questions. And somebody puts up their hand and say, I'm depressed.

I'm despondent. I don't understand what  you're talking about. I feel cast out. I feel like it's all over. God stops.

Because verse 15,  verse 16, in fact, all the rest of the chapter. God stops what he's saying. He changed the subject  because they say, you've forgotten me and everything about the rest of the chapter is about that idea. In other words, God, God lets himself be interrupted. He stops.

And that's very important. Recently I have a, when I think about my own pastoral career, I realize that no matter what gender  you are, no matter what race you are, no matter what age you are, we're all stupid in our own,  special way. And when I was a young pastor, I had a tendency not to stop. When someone spoke  despondently, there's a tendency to just pour on the theology. So, well, let me finish my lecture.

Let me, you know, don't you know, you're just a fight by faith. You're adopted into the family. You're going to rule and reign. Don't you know, you're theology. It's when you're younger,  when you're a younger band, when a younger pastor, there's a tendency to just say, well, I can fix this.

Let me keep on going with my, my thing. You know, let me just pour the theology on. But God stops. Now, on the other hand, as I'm becoming an older minister, as it's obvious, I realize I still don't want  to stop, but for different reasons. Well, you know, now when you see somebody despondent, in spite of  all these great claims, now when you see someone say, I know what Christianity teaches, and I know what  the Bible says, and I know all that, I'm still depressed.

There's a tendency to look down and say, well,  get over it. But you know, when you get older, you've seen people get through things and you say, come on,  you'll survive. This will be all right. You know, what are you wallowing for? People have had much  worse problems than you have, and you get through it, and I've been through.

So when you're younger,  it's a tendency not to stop and really listen, and when you get older, it's a tendency not to stop  and really listen. I don't know when I'll be a good pastor. I do know this. God is interrupted. He stops.

But the other general principle, he stops, but he argues, because verse 15 and 16 is an argument. Verse 15 and 16 is pugnacious. Verse 15 and 16 is contradicting what the despondent heart says,  and this is a perfect balance, because on the other hand, he's got the compassion to stop, but he argues. Now, if you want a perfect example of this principle, this balance that you've got to have, if you're  dealing with your own despondency, or somebody else's, the principle is best embodied in Psalm 42,  where you have a Psalmist who's discouraged, and the Psalmist says to himself, he says,  why art thou cast down on my soul? Why art thou cast down on my soul?

And why art thou is  quite with him? Now, if you look here, that's the perfect balance, because on the one hand,  he's listening to a soul. He's listening to his heart. He's saying, what's the source of your  disquiet? What's the source of your casting down?

He's listening to his heart. But on the other hand,  he's arguing with his heart. Why are you cast down on my soul? What are you doing down there? Now, here's the principle I mean.

Before we move on to specifics, it's the general principle. If you don't listen to your heart, you'll be in psychological rubble. But if you only listen to your  heart, you'll be in psychological rubble. If you don't listen to your heart, by the way,  almost all of us fall into one of these or the other. One of these mistakes.

Some of us just don't  listen. We say, oh, well, you know, you, you, you deny it. You don't, you know, all that upset. I'm  not angry. I'm not, I'm all right.

I'm fine. And you just stay busy. And you don't sit down and  listen to your heart. You don't listen to find out just how bad is it? And what's the cause of it?

So a lot of us just, well, you know, we're kind of extroverts, you know, so let's get out and do  things. You know, that'll, I'll just be fine. We don't listen to our heart. On the other hand,  some of us do nothing but listen to our heart. We just let our heart forsaken, forgotten, forsaken,  forgotten.

You want chemistry? I'm forsaken. I'm forgot. Now listen, if you only listen to your heart  and you never talk to it and you never grab hold of it and you say just the truth,  you're out of touch with reality, buddy. I mean, you have to do that.

If you don't,  if you never listen to your heart and if you only listen to your heart, but see what God does  is he stops to listen. He takes it very seriously, but he argues. And that's the general principles. However, what's the specific things he does with a despondent heart? And there's three things.

And you know what? As I hinted at the beginning, these three things do not just cure a despondent heart,  and this is the cure for a sinful heart. You know, the word forgotten for forsaken, the word for  forsaken is kind of an external word. It has more to do with you haven't come through for me,  but the word forgotten is more of an internal word, which is you've rejected me. For forsaken has more to do without a sight and forgotten, more out of mind.

For forsaken,  more is how can you have let these things happen to me? Forgotten is more like you've rejected me  because there's something wrong, isn't there? I'm no good. And you know, sometimes despondency  is made up more of anger than shame and sometimes it's made up more of shame than anger,  but they're kissing cousins. They're very, very close.

It's very hard to know, which is which  sometimes. And so when God comes to the despondent sinful sick heart, he enjoins three things. He calls us to three things. And they're all here in verse 15 and 16, verse 15, 16 A and 16 B. Look, well, I'll just say what the three things are.

He says, think of who you. Think of who I am. Look at what I have done. And practice who you are, okay? Think of who I am.

Look at what I've done and practice who you are. Now, here's the three. First of all,  think of who I am. Who is he? Now, we have here a metaphor that God deliberately chooses to tell us  something about who he is.

Verse 15, can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no  compassion on the child? She is born. Yay, she may forget, but I will not forget you. Now, why does God pick a nursing mother to tell us something about himself? This is not  sentimental.

As a matter of fact, it's not sentimental at all. If you think about it, because he's  really talking about mothers who sometimes forget. I mean, this isn't sentimentalizing. This is not a way of saying, oh, there's nothing like a mother's love. This is not what's going on here  because there are things like a mother's love.

A love between husband and wife is certainly as deep,  really richer and certainly more satisfying, I think. But God has chosen this particular kind  of human connection to tell us something about himself that's incredible. I mean, well, here's what it is. What is a nursing mother like or in relationship to  what is this? Okay.

This is the point. A nursing mother's relationship of love to her child is not  that volitional. It's not that it's not conditional. It's not volitional and conditional. You fall in love  with somebody.

You choose that person. They choose you. You know, you do something. They do  something. If they don't reciprocate, you can't go on.

Okay. There's conditions. There's volition. There's choices, but there's something incredibly powerful and virtually automatic. A mother's love for  her child is driven by her very nature.

It's driven by her biology. It's hardwired. Let me give you  three examples of this. A nursing mother, first of all, a nursing mother's relationship to her child  is rigidly regular. I had a laugh, by the way.

Matthew Henry is a Puritan who wrote a commentary at the  end of the 1600, 1690s. Puritans, they're a little straight-laced. Why would a man know this  except that I understand his wife had 11 children? Therefore, this is what he says in his commentary. A  nursing mother, most of all, cannot but be tender of her sucking child for her own breast will  soon put her in mind of it if she should forget it.

Here's something. By the way, for some of you  guys, this might come as news for you. Unless a nursing mother regularly nurses her child,  unless she releases the milk, unless she is meeting the needs of her child, she's in pain. Your breasts hurt. Yes, love between a man and a woman.

That might be people say, well, that's  hormones, but boy, this is hormones. You say, well, your hormones are driving, but not like this. Every so many hours you're in pain if you don't meet the needs of this loved one is unbelievably  regular, and then secondly, it's incredibly tender and emotional. There's another thing that  Matthew Henry and I have learned from talking to nursing mothers is that along with the milk  comes tremendous feelings of nurture and emotion. Sometimes the milk brings the feeling,  sometimes the feelings and the thoughts bring the milk.

This is a part of the biology,  it's part of the hormone. It's part of who she is that as she thinks loving thoughts, the milk comes  and it's a tremendous tenderness. She takes that baby and she looks at every single thing about it. She looks at every hair. She looks at every eyelash.

She's moved by who she is to this enormously  detailed and tender care. And then thirdly, it's not only rigidly regular. It's not unbelievably  emotionally tender, but it is utterly unconditional. When you enter into a relationship with a husband  or wife or you get romantically involved with somebody, there's got to be some reciprocity. Then the person's got to do something back.

I'm sorry. The person never even speaks on your first  date. You know, you've had a bad date. But here's a woman that finds herself driven by her very being  to lovingly, suddenly new mothers, this happens. Your life stops.

Everything in your life stops  and it's completely revolving around this little thing. Seven days a week, 25 hours a day,  seven days a week, 365 days a year. And the kid doesn't even burp. Thank you. Those burps are not thank you.

So you can, you want to imagine it fine, but it's just not the case. The child does nothing. The child, there's no conditions. Doesn't matter what the child does,  what child looks like the child doesn't merit it. It is utterly, utterly regular.

It is utterly tender  and it is completely unconditional. Imagine God to choose this to talk about how He relates to us. It's not the only image, friends. This is not the only image. Of course, we know there's others  to get across the idea.

But do you see the power of this thing? He says that's  how I relate to you. That is one image that I can give you to give you some idea  about how strongly, how powerfully, how detailed and how unconditionally I love you. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God. Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face  every situation, including death.

In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365 day devotional, the songs of Jesus,  you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start. And if you already spend time and study and prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms  can help you bring your deepest emotions and questions before God and discover a new level of  intimacy with Him. We'll send you Tim and Kathy Keller's devotional as our thanks for your gift  to help Gospel and Life share the love of Jesus with more people.

There are women  who buck nature. There are women who don't do it. But what he's trying to say is simply this. He says, my love for you is not only exactly like a mother's natural love, but it's infinitely  greater. But don't you see the real point?

He's not just saying, you see a mother's love? Mine's  more powerful. You see a mother's love? Mine's more free and unconditional. You see a mother's  love?

My love is more detailed. Don't I say in Psalm 56? I know how many tears are going down your  cheek even a mother doesn't know that. But he's going beyond that. And he's trying to say,  I am misdriven by my nature to love you as a mother is to love her child.

It is utterly natural. And when he says that, now there's a number of commentators that have helped me on this  and have said, this is astounding because if you think about it, especially since, and this is  one of the reasons why this sermon came after last week's sermon, last week's sermon tells us  something about the nature of God. He is holy. He's a judge. He is a, what, we talked about this  lot.

He's an angry God. He's angry about evil. He's a God of tremendous justice. And in light of  that, what would you say? If God loves us, surely he's bucking his nature.

If God loves us, surely  it's wonderful, but surely he's bucking it. And God says, no. If I would cease to love you, I'd cease  to be me. Everything about me, everything about my nature leads me to be absolutely,  powerfully, unconditionally, tenderly, emotionally, regularly. I hurt.

It's hard to believe  that he would say, I hurt if I don't make your needs. How could that be? Well, it's the second. The first thing he says, this is who I am, but you don't understand how that could be unless  he's looked secondly at, look what I've done. And what has he done?

Verse 16, the first, for  first clause is what he's saying. See? I have engraved you on the palms of my hand. Now this is the  answer to what we just asked. How could, how, I know, some of you are going to the bends.

I mean,  last week, the whole point was, this is an angry God. And God says he's an angry God. He says, I am a  pure eyes that can be hold iniquity. And here he says, my very purity, my very, my very nature  has turned me into someone far more powerfully, far more driven to love you than a mother for an  infant. How could that be?

Here's the answer. Look what he's done. I have engraved you on the palms  of my hands. Now what in the world is that mean? Let's let's break it into two pieces, engraved  palm of the hands.

What is this image getting across? Everything. First of all, engraved. Listen,  there are some perfectly decent words they could have used. Or Isaiah could have used or God could have  used, however they worked this out, which I don't completely understand.

But perfectly good words  for, for, for tattoo, they didn't use them. This isn't, it's not what it's saying. Nothing tattooed. It's not saying written engraved. And the word engraved, you say, what does the word, what it means exactly  what it means in English?

It means to get out a hammer and get out a chisel and to actually cut into  stump something hard. That's weird. Why? Well, first of all, engraved means two things. First of all,  it means permanent.

He's put his name, our names on his hands permanently. They'll never wash off,  they'll never wear off. There's two ways, you know, you put something on your hands. Sometimes  it washes off. Sometimes it just wears off with a lot of heavy use.

Nothing. We'll take our name off his  hands. But it's not just permanent. The word engraved also means artistry. He doesn't say he  chipped it.

Ingraved is a work of art. And it gets at this. What it's getting at is the other place  in the Bible that talks about our names being engraved is back in Exodus 28. In Exodus 28, we're told  the high priest when he goes before God into the tabernacle is wearing an effort, which is a  breastplate. And on the breastplate, there are two precious stones.

They're in a gold. They're  encased in gold. So they're absolutely gorgeous. And on those stones is engraved the names of  the children of Israel. And why?

Well, see, this is the connection between the two. In verse  in chapter 28, it says, why is the high priest doing that? It's very simple. It says in order  to be a perpetual memorial before the Lord. Memorial.

In other words, whenever God minds us, this is  what Exodus 28 say. Whenever God remembers us, whenever God thinks of us, he looks at our names  and he sees a beauty. He says an unbelievable beauty. Now listen, just for a second, this is something  that no other religion, not only no other religion gives you, this is even something that most of us  who erased in Christian churches have never really come to grips with. This is an astonishing  statement.

And grave means the work of art. And this is what God is saying. It is possible  to be in a relationship with me. So you are not just tolerated by me. So you don't just have  access to me.

So that you don't just every so often you're able to come and get things from me. You don't have just a relationship in which when you die, you'll be able to have blessings  and paradise. He is saying, it's possible to be in a relationship with me so that you know that  when I look at you, I'm having an aesthetic experience. And you see the link  when a mother looks at a child because of her very nature, she just drools over the child. Literally.

And God says it's possible to be in a relationship with me so that when I see you,  I'm ravished with your beauty, I can't get over you. I can hardly express the delight, I can hardly  understand. I can't hardly believe I'm just drawn to you. That's the link. We're engraved.

It means we are an aesthetic experience. Here's another way to put it. When God, what do you  look like? Who are you? When it's possible to be in a relationship with God so that you know  this, that when God looks at you, he sees an absolute beauty.

And of course, if God sees you that way,  then that's the definitive view. It doesn't matter what it doesn't matter what your friends say,  it doesn't matter what your parents say, it doesn't matter what the mirror says. It doesn't matter  if you put on five pounds, it doesn't matter. None of those things could pop. This is the ultimate  mind.

This is the ultimate view. This is the ultimate you. And God says, yes, it's possible to be  in a relationship to me so that you're a work of art. When you say, how could that be? And here's  the answer.

It's not, you see, if you go back to Exodus 28, it's almost completely inexplicable. How  in the world could we possibly be something that beautiful? Well, yeah, I see, we're engraved on  these beautiful stones on a high precephal. That's beautiful. It's wonderful.

How, how could that  possibly be? This is ridiculous, maybe you'd say. But here we see something else. Here we see  our names are engraved on his hands. On the palms.

Now, first of all, the palms of the hands means  this is the most visible place. If I, if I would engrave something anywhere else in my body, I might  not see it. But my palms, my hands, I can't help but see it. Secondly, what this means is it means  that absolutely everything he does, the palm is the way you do everything. This is how I move my  mic.

Here's how I look at my watch. Here's how I turn off the light. I have to use my palms. And when  God says, I put your, your name on the palms of my hand, what he's saying is everything I do. I'm doing for you.

It's like a mother. Everything I do, I'm doing for you. No matter what happens,  I'm doing for you. You know, so here's Joseph and his brothers grab him and throw him into a pit. Remember?

And they sell him into slavery to Egypt. And he's down the pit. We're told  back in the passage in Genesis and he's crying out to them. And he's crying out to God. And God  seems like he doesn't remember him, doesn't hear him.

But you see later on, Joseph was able to realize  if God had actually answered my prayer as I made it, I'd be dead now. I never would have become  Prime Minister of Egypt. I never would have run the family relief program. I never would have saved  all those thousands of people. I wouldn't even have saved my own family's physical life.

And I never  would have led my own brothers to repentance. And therefore, they would have been spiritually dead,  they would have been physically dead. In other words, God, when he seemed to not answer my prayer,  was remembering me, everything that happens, everything he does is being done for me. It's amazing. You say, well, but that's not all.

It's not just that it's on the palm of the hands  of the most visible place, not palms of the hands of the most active place, but it's the most vulnerable  place. You see, when somebody says, listen, see, my outstretched palms, this is the trans cultural  sign of vulnerability. If someone says, hands up, come out with your hands up, you don't come out  like this. They'll shoot you. I mean, hands palms means I have no weapon.

A palm means I have to  open my palm to shake, to shake your hand. A palm means appeal, a palm means welcome, a palm means  receive. When my palms are open, I am vulnerable. Now, here's the question, how in the world,  why in the world would someone engrave the palm? That would be, if you're going to put a chisel,  that's just terrible.

That must have hurt terribly. It did. Many centuries later,  somebody came to another doubter, another despondent person, his name was Thomas. And he said to Thomas, look at the palms of my hands. And when you look at Jesus Christ,  look at the palms of his hands to see where your name is, and you will see nail prints.

Why? This is the reason why we're a beauty to him. The reason we're such a beauty to God is because  our names have been engraved in something more precious than stones, more precious than diamonds. The sufferings of Jesus, the nails of Jesus, are the tools with which  our names are engraved on the palms of the hands. And what that means,  finally we have an answer to how 15 can be true. 16,000 is how 15 can be true.

If Jesus Christ has, is our high priest, if he stands before the Father's throne, and he says,  look at what I have done. Look at my suffering. Look at how I've paid for everything. Look at how I've made a sacrifice. Do you know what that means?

Over the years, when I first heard  that Jesus Christ was our high priest, and this is in Hebrews chapter 7, I'll affect the whole book  of Hebrews, and it's in verse 1, chapter 2, where it says that Jesus Christ, it's just an image,  but it's getting a point across. Jesus Christ stands before the throne of God. And he shows  the wounds. And he pleads for us. When I first heard about that, I said, well, that's good,  but it's not completely comforting, because how many times will God finally listen to Jesus about me?

I mean, I keep failing, and I keep failing, and I keep failing, and I guess every day,  Monday morning Jesus will come on up there and say, look, Tim did it again. But for my sake, would you please continue to love him? I see God up there on the throne saying,  well, all right. But that's to miss the whole thrust of everything this whole passage is about. When Jesus Christ stands before the father's throne now, we know this.

He is not, when he says,  love my brothers and sisters. When he pleads for us, he's not demanding, he's not asking for mercy. You know that? He's not asking for mercy. He's demanding justice.

Okay, give me 60 seconds, will you? Jesus Christ is saying this,  thy law, O God, the man's death. For sin, I have paid all their debts. They trusted me,  their debts are paid, and therefore for you to get any punishment from them would be to be getting  two payments. Therefore, O God, all thy holiness, all thy justice, not just thy mercy, not just  thy mercy, not just thy love, all thy holiness, all thy justice, all of your nature demands that you  see them as a beauty.

Every other religion and probably most of you who went to churches, Christian  churches believe the same thing. Every other religion thinks that when it comes to my relationship with  God, it's sort of like a set of scales. You see the set of scales, right? You know, in old courtrooms,  they always have some blind lady or something like that. You know, the blindfold on with the blindfolds  on with the scales.

And what does everybody think? Well, I have good deeds and bad deeds, and if I  have more good deeds and bad deeds of my good deeds, I weigh my bad deeds, then God will deal with me. And Christianity says, the very holiness of God, the very righteousness of God,  compared to which all the mountains of the world and all the planets of the world are like a piece of  dust, are on your side now. That's the reason why first John, if you think I'm exaggerating,  first John 1 verse 8 says, if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins. It doesn't say he's faithful and merciful.

Oh, of course he is, but I didn't say that. If he  would not forgive, if he would not continually accept us, those of us who believed in Jesus Christ,  he would be unjust. And that means his whole nature is now for us. Let me put it to you in a  nutshell. What power could turn the holiness, the righteousness, the vengeance, and the wrath  of God against evil?

What power could turn all that into mother's milk? What power in the whole  universe could change things so that every bit of God's holiness now demands that he loves you  like a mother? It's the cross. There's a hymn that goes, what wondrousness, what mysteries in this  appointment shine, my breaches of the law are his and all his obedience, mine. That's the gospel.

Lay your deadly doing down, down to Jesus' feet, stand in him and him alone, gloriously complete,  and see if you see what he is and then see what he's done. You can start to live as you really are  because the last part of verse 16 says something very simple. What does it say? He says,  thy walls are ever before me. Well, you wait a minute.

Wait a minute. Wait a minute. The walls  are broken. No, they're not. Not in God's mind.

God says, I treat you the way you're going to be. I practice towards you, not the way you look right now, but the way you're going to be. And that's what we're supposed to be doing. It's another way to put it. It's simply this.

We are supposed to also take what he has done for us and say, look, if this is how he sees me,  then that's how I have to see myself. You have to apply this and it will do anything. When you  suffer, what are you supposed to say? Why have you forsaken me? Wait a minute.

Wait a minute. That word forsaken that's used in verse 14 is also used in Psalm 21, verse 1. It's the very same  word Jesus cried on the cross. Jesus Christ is saying, you are not forsaken. I was forsaken.

I was forsaken so that even when you're thrown into pits and you cry out and say, please don't  sell me into slavery, God will never, never forget you. He'll never forget you because he forgot me. And you must never act as if he has. What that means is, when no matter what you're suffering,  you say, this can't be punishment. It's can't be punishment.

It's all fallen into the heart of Jesus. It can't be. When you feel guilty, you have to say, this can't bring me into condemnation. And when you feel disappointment, when you feel discouraged, ultimately discouragement  forsaken is always comes from this. Discouragement and forsakenness means,  I'm sorry.

I know this is going to be vivid, but this is the text. When God says,  you're going to mothers for something only I can give you. There is a milk that your soul needs. It's everlasting love. Mother's love can't be everlasting.

Even the mothers who are great die. And most mothers aren't great. And whatever you're, if you're discouraged and you say,  I'm forsaken, I'm forsaken, it's because there's something that you've made your mother instead of me. There's something that you say, if I have this, then I'm beautiful. You're only beautiful in me.

And that's the reason why he says, if you see in a sense this, no matter what your situation is,  whether it's guilt, whether it's lack of self-control, whether it's suffering, no matter what it is,  you apply this. Apply this. This is the health of my soul. Can I just be honest? This is the health of  my soul.

Not just that in general, I'm living for Jesus, not just in general. He forgives me when I  fall down, but that every fiber of God's attributes are for me. Therefore, the stars will fall from  heaven, but his love for me cannot change. On the basis of that, I have something to stand on. Any other ground is sinking sand, some marsh, and it can be the healthier soul, too.

Here's one  less thing. I did use to have a house in which we had babies. I just remember this. The only time  whenever it was quiet, my gosh, it's quiet. I suddenly realized why.

It's because they were nursing. I mean, it was the only time they ever were, because they can't cry when they're nursing. How quiet is  your soul? This is what God is saying. If your soul's not quiet, if it's restless, if it's a mess,  you don't know what it's like to know who he is, to see what he's done, and to practice who you  are now in him.

Because when you get a handle on that, you finally got the milk. You're finally  your soul's quieted. Let's pray. Our Father, we ask that you would show us how this, how Jesus was  destroyed by justice so that now justice is on our side, and your love for us is indestructible. Would you please show us how that works out?

Would you please show us how we can apply that? Father, this is a strong medicine. It's the most difficult thing for many of us to grab hold on. We try to hold on to it, and we find that we have to beat it into our heads over and over again,  and we lose our orientation towards so quickly. Would you, Lord, tonight, buy your grace and grave  these truths into our hearts deeper than they've ever been engraved so that we can start to practice  who we are and really see what you've done.

We pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today's message, Tim Keller explores the human condition through stories in the Bible,  uncovering what Scripture says about sin and why it's the only explanation deep enough  to face the truth about ourselves. I'm going to read you from Isaiah chapter 49. I'm going to read verses 8 down to 16. It's  in your bulletin. I'm going to read to verse 16.

This is what the Lord says. In the time  of my favor, I will answer you and in the time of day of salvation, I will help you. I will keep  you and I will make you to be a covenant for the people to restore the land and to re assign its  desolate inheritances to say to the captives, come out and to those in darkness be free. They will  feed beside the roads and find pasture on every barren hill. They will neither hunger nor thirst,  nor will the desert heat or the sun beat upon them.

He who has compassion on them will guide  them and lead them beside springs of water. I will turn all my mountains into roads and my highways  will be raised up. See, they will come from afar, some from the north from this west, some from  the region of Aswan. Shout for joy, oh heavens, rejoice so earth, burst into song, oh mountains,  for the Lord comforts his people and will have compassion on his afflicted ones. But Zion said, the Lord has forsaken me, the Lord has forgotten me.

Can a mother forget  the baby at her breast had had no compassion on the child she has born? Though she may forget, I will not forget you. See, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands. Your walls are ever before me. Let's end there.

This is God's Word. Now, if you've been coming over the weeks, you know, this is the actually end of a series on what  the Bible has to say about what's wrong with the human heart, what's wrong with the human race,  what the Bible calls sin. And if you're part of this series, you need to know that if you've  been following this series, this is the ultimate cure. Well, we actually have here, let me remind you  this when we've been in Isaiah for a while, what we have here is something written to people who are  going to face our facing exile. The Jews had Jerusalem destroyed.

That's the reason why there's  discussion about Zion's wall. Zion was the hill on which the temple was built. And therefore,  the word Zion can mean the city of Jerusalem. It sometimes can mean the temple, but the point is  that when the Babylonian Empire came and besieged Jerusalem and destroyed it, everything was torn down. The walls of Jerusalem were torn down.

The temple was torn down. The people were sent into captivity. And what Isaiah is giving us is a prophecy from the Lord to the people. And here he's asking,  here he's answering the question. And the question is going to be, how can we face this?

What are  you going to do about this? Now, up to verse 13 and we didn't print all of it in this chapter,  we have a typical theological discourse. Isaiah, through Isaiah, God is saying what he's going to do  about it. And verses 1 to 8, we start with verse 8, but verses 1 to 8 of chapter 49 talks about  the servant, this mysterious figure who's going to come, the servant of the Lord. And what he's  going to do is he's going to suffer.

And as a result of the suffering, we say in verses 9 to 12,  he's going to gather a new people. He's going to create a new community of people from the east  and the west, pardon not from the east actually, from the desert over there, but from the north and  the west and the south. And there are going to be people who have been brought out of darkness,  people who have been set free. And so because of his suffering, he's going to create a new  community. And then lastly, when you get to verse 13, which is the climax, this enormous theological  discourse, we're told here that what God is going to do through the servant and in this group  of people, is going to be a such power that is going to actually redeem all of the world.

Because  when you see here, we see shop for joy or heavens, or earth person to song or mountains,  God is actually going to renew all of creation. Whatever God does is going to be so powerful that  all of creation, the heavens and the earth is everything's going to be renewed. Everything's going  to be brought into some kind of blossom. And that's what God is saying. He's going to do.

It's  sweeping. It's huge. It's immense. And it's too sweeping and it's too huge and it's too immense. Because verse 14 just hits you between the eyes.

If you're reading along, if you're reading through  the chapter, in a way, I can see this in a way that you can't because I didn't print you the whole  chapter here. But if you move on through the chapter, here's God talking about, I'm going to do  this. And I'm going to do that. And this is, of course, at least the Stoxology where he's calling  nature to blossom into praise God. And suddenly verse 14 comes along.

And what is verse 14? What is it? The people listening to God respond. And what do they say? Wow, no, what do they say?

Look,  I'm still depressed. Here's God saying, oh, look at all the things I'm going to do. And what it says,  but Zion said, the Lord has forsaken me. The Lord has forgotten me. Now what you have here  is God giving this theological discourse to the people.

And the people responding by saying  that, say, saying this, the realities of my present life are overwhelming such remote, abstract,  distant, lofty promises and claims. All your theology. All I know is Zion's broken down. My life  is broken down. How could you let this happen to me?

In other words, here's God giving this great  theological discourse. And the people say, I'm still depressed. You forsaken me. You forgot me. I don't even know what you're talking about all this heavens and earth.

I don't know who this  servant is. I don't know what's going on here. And therefore what we have is industrial strength  despondency, the human heart. It's very hard to make the human heart feel happy and loved. I mean, some of us are worse than others.

Let's face it. But basically here, listen, you tell a human  heart. You're a disgrace. You're trash. You're despicable.

And you never forget those. You never  forget statements like that. Never in your whole life. But you tell a human heart, you're wonderful,  you're great. I like you.

And you need that. It fades so fast. Five minutes later, you need to hear  it again. Or you forget it. The human heart falls into respondents in spite of claims of love.

And what does God do? We have here. It's very interesting. In verse 14, we see someone saying  in spite of all these great claims, I'm still depressed. You don't love me.

I don't feel left by you. I don't feel that you're committed to me. And we see how God deals with a despondent heart. And that's pretty instructive. How does God deal with it?

How does God deal with a person who's  despondent in despair? First of all, let me show you two general principles and then three specific  principles, two general ways in which God works with a despondent depressed person. And then three  very specific things that he joins us to do. First, there's two real general principles and they go  like this. First of all, God stops.

That may not be as easy for you to see unless you read in the  whole chapter, but God sees on his way. He's talking about things. And he's actually got, he's,  verses 1 to 13 is really a wonderful, a wonderful, there's the structure of this discourse is  wonderful. And I'm not even going to talk about it here tonight, because I don't think that's what  we're going to, we're not going to dwell on that. But he actually talks about three great stages in  history of salvation.

He's moving from the cross to a new community to a new creation, from  cross to community to new creation. It's really wonderful. And then suddenly he looks down and he  says, any questions, I mean, this is like it like sure. He's I'm going on to say any questions. And somebody puts up their hand and say, I'm depressed.

I'm despondent. I don't understand what  you're talking about. I feel cast out. I feel like it's all over. God stops.

Because verse 15,  verse 16, in fact, all the rest of the chapter. God stops what he's saying. He changed the subject  because they say, you've forgotten me and everything about the rest of the chapter is about that idea. In other words, God, God lets himself be interrupted. He stops.

And that's very important. Recently I have a, when I think about my own pastoral career, I realize that no matter what gender  you are, no matter what race you are, no matter what age you are, we're all stupid in our own,  special way. And when I was a young pastor, I had a tendency not to stop. When someone spoke  despondently, there's a tendency to just pour on the theology. So, well, let me finish my lecture.

Let me, you know, don't you know, you're just a fight by faith. You're adopted into the family. You're going to rule and reign. Don't you know, you're theology. It's when you're younger,  when you're a younger band, when a younger pastor, there's a tendency to just say, well, I can fix this.

Let me keep on going with my, my thing. You know, let me just pour the theology on. But God stops. Now, on the other hand, as I'm becoming an older minister, as it's obvious, I realize I still don't want  to stop, but for different reasons. Well, you know, now when you see somebody despondent, in spite of  all these great claims, now when you see someone say, I know what Christianity teaches, and I know what  the Bible says, and I know all that, I'm still depressed.

There's a tendency to look down and say, well,  get over it. But you know, when you get older, you've seen people get through things and you say, come on,  you'll survive. This will be all right. You know, what are you wallowing for? People have had much  worse problems than you have, and you get through it, and I've been through.

So when you're younger,  it's a tendency not to stop and really listen, and when you get older, it's a tendency not to stop  and really listen. I don't know when I'll be a good pastor. I do know this. God is interrupted. He stops.

But the other general principle, he stops, but he argues, because verse 15 and 16 is an argument. Verse 15 and 16 is pugnacious. Verse 15 and 16 is contradicting what the despondent heart says,  and this is a perfect balance, because on the other hand, he's got the compassion to stop, but he argues. Now, if you want a perfect example of this principle, this balance that you've got to have, if you're  dealing with your own despondency, or somebody else's, the principle is best embodied in Psalm 42,  where you have a Psalmist who's discouraged, and the Psalmist says to himself, he says,  why art thou cast down on my soul? Why art thou cast down on my soul?

And why art thou is  quite with him? Now, if you look here, that's the perfect balance, because on the one hand,  he's listening to a soul. He's listening to his heart. He's saying, what's the source of your  disquiet? What's the source of your casting down?

He's listening to his heart. But on the other hand,  he's arguing with his heart. Why are you cast down on my soul? What are you doing down there? Now, here's the principle I mean.

Before we move on to specifics, it's the general principle. If you don't listen to your heart, you'll be in psychological rubble. But if you only listen to your  heart, you'll be in psychological rubble. If you don't listen to your heart, by the way,  almost all of us fall into one of these or the other. One of these mistakes.

Some of us just don't  listen. We say, oh, well, you know, you, you, you deny it. You don't, you know, all that upset. I'm  not angry. I'm not, I'm all right.

I'm fine. And you just stay busy. And you don't sit down and  listen to your heart. You don't listen to find out just how bad is it? And what's the cause of it?

So a lot of us just, well, you know, we're kind of extroverts, you know, so let's get out and do  things. You know, that'll, I'll just be fine. We don't listen to our heart. On the other hand,  some of us do nothing but listen to our heart. We just let our heart forsaken, forgotten, forsaken,  forgotten.

You want chemistry? I'm forsaken. I'm forgot. Now listen, if you only listen to your heart  and you never talk to it and you never grab hold of it and you say just the truth,  you're out of touch with reality, buddy. I mean, you have to do that.

If you don't,  if you never listen to your heart and if you only listen to your heart, but see what God does  is he stops to listen. He takes it very seriously, but he argues. And that's the general principles. However, what's the specific things he does with a despondent heart? And there's three things.

And you know what? As I hinted at the beginning, these three things do not just cure a despondent heart,  and this is the cure for a sinful heart. You know, the word forgotten for forsaken, the word for  forsaken is kind of an external word. It has more to do with you haven't come through for me,  but the word forgotten is more of an internal word, which is you've rejected me. For forsaken has more to do without a sight and forgotten, more out of mind.

For forsaken,  more is how can you have let these things happen to me? Forgotten is more like you've rejected me  because there's something wrong, isn't there? I'm no good. And you know, sometimes despondency  is made up more of anger than shame and sometimes it's made up more of shame than anger,  but they're kissing cousins. They're very, very close.

It's very hard to know, which is which  sometimes. And so when God comes to the despondent sinful sick heart, he enjoins three things. He calls us to three things. And they're all here in verse 15 and 16, verse 15, 16 A and 16 B. Look, well, I'll just say what the three things are.

He says, think of who you. Think of who I am. Look at what I have done. And practice who you are, okay? Think of who I am.

Look at what I've done and practice who you are. Now, here's the three. First of all,  think of who I am. Who is he? Now, we have here a metaphor that God deliberately chooses to tell us  something about who he is.

Verse 15, can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no  compassion on the child? She is born. Yay, she may forget, but I will not forget you. Now, why does God pick a nursing mother to tell us something about himself? This is not  sentimental.

As a matter of fact, it's not sentimental at all. If you think about it, because he's  really talking about mothers who sometimes forget. I mean, this isn't sentimentalizing. This is not a way of saying, oh, there's nothing like a mother's love. This is not what's going on here  because there are things like a mother's love.

A love between husband and wife is certainly as deep,  really richer and certainly more satisfying, I think. But God has chosen this particular kind  of human connection to tell us something about himself that's incredible. I mean, well, here's what it is. What is a nursing mother like or in relationship to  what is this? Okay.

This is the point. A nursing mother's relationship of love to her child is not  that volitional. It's not that it's not conditional. It's not volitional and conditional. You fall in love  with somebody.

You choose that person. They choose you. You know, you do something. They do  something. If they don't reciprocate, you can't go on.

Okay. There's conditions. There's volition. There's choices, but there's something incredibly powerful and virtually automatic. A mother's love for  her child is driven by her very nature.

It's driven by her biology. It's hardwired. Let me give you  three examples of this. A nursing mother, first of all, a nursing mother's relationship to her child  is rigidly regular. I had a laugh, by the way.

Matthew Henry is a Puritan who wrote a commentary at the  end of the 1600, 1690s. Puritans, they're a little straight-laced. Why would a man know this  except that I understand his wife had 11 children? Therefore, this is what he says in his commentary. A  nursing mother, most of all, cannot but be tender of her sucking child for her own breast will  soon put her in mind of it if she should forget it.

Here's something. By the way, for some of you  guys, this might come as news for you. Unless a nursing mother regularly nurses her child,  unless she releases the milk, unless she is meeting the needs of her child, she's in pain. Your breasts hurt. Yes, love between a man and a woman.

That might be people say, well, that's  hormones, but boy, this is hormones. You say, well, your hormones are driving, but not like this. Every so many hours you're in pain if you don't meet the needs of this loved one is unbelievably  regular, and then secondly, it's incredibly tender and emotional. There's another thing that  Matthew Henry and I have learned from talking to nursing mothers is that along with the milk  comes tremendous feelings of nurture and emotion. Sometimes the milk brings the feeling,  sometimes the feelings and the thoughts bring the milk.

This is a part of the biology,  it's part of the hormone. It's part of who she is that as she thinks loving thoughts, the milk comes  and it's a tremendous tenderness. She takes that baby and she looks at every single thing about it. She looks at every hair. She looks at every eyelash.

She's moved by who she is to this enormously  detailed and tender care. And then thirdly, it's not only rigidly regular. It's not unbelievably  emotionally tender, but it is utterly unconditional. When you enter into a relationship with a husband  or wife or you get romantically involved with somebody, there's got to be some reciprocity. Then the person's got to do something back.

I'm sorry. The person never even speaks on your first  date. You know, you've had a bad date. But here's a woman that finds herself driven by her very being  to lovingly, suddenly new mothers, this happens. Your life stops.

Everything in your life stops  and it's completely revolving around this little thing. Seven days a week, 25 hours a day,  seven days a week, 365 days a year. And the kid doesn't even burp. Thank you. Those burps are not thank you.

So you can, you want to imagine it fine, but it's just not the case. The child does nothing. The child, there's no conditions. Doesn't matter what the child does,  what child looks like the child doesn't merit it. It is utterly, utterly regular.

It is utterly tender  and it is completely unconditional. Imagine God to choose this to talk about how He relates to us. It's not the only image, friends. This is not the only image. Of course, we know there's others  to get across the idea.

But do you see the power of this thing? He says that's  how I relate to you. That is one image that I can give you to give you some idea  about how strongly, how powerfully, how detailed and how unconditionally I love you. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God. Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face  every situation, including death.

There are women  who buck nature. There are women who don't do it. But what he's trying to say is simply this. He says, my love for you is not only exactly like a mother's natural love, but it's infinitely  greater. But don't you see the real point?

He's not just saying, you see a mother's love? Mine's  more powerful. You see a mother's love? Mine's more free and unconditional. You see a mother's  love?

My love is more detailed. Don't I say in Psalm 56? I know how many tears are going down your  cheek even a mother doesn't know that. But he's going beyond that. And he's trying to say,  I am misdriven by my nature to love you as a mother is to love her child.

It is utterly natural. And when he says that, now there's a number of commentators that have helped me on this  and have said, this is astounding because if you think about it, especially since, and this is  one of the reasons why this sermon came after last week's sermon, last week's sermon tells us  something about the nature of God. He is holy. He's a judge. He is a, what, we talked about this  lot.

He's an angry God. He's angry about evil. He's a God of tremendous justice. And in light of  that, what would you say? If God loves us, surely he's bucking his nature.

If God loves us, surely  it's wonderful, but surely he's bucking it. And God says, no. If I would cease to love you, I'd cease  to be me. Everything about me, everything about my nature leads me to be absolutely,  powerfully, unconditionally, tenderly, emotionally, regularly. I hurt.

It's hard to believe  that he would say, I hurt if I don't make your needs. How could that be? Well, it's the second. The first thing he says, this is who I am, but you don't understand how that could be unless  he's looked secondly at, look what I've done. And what has he done?

Verse 16, the first, for  first clause is what he's saying. See? I have engraved you on the palms of my hand. Now this is the  answer to what we just asked. How could, how, I know, some of you are going to the bends.

I mean,  last week, the whole point was, this is an angry God. And God says he's an angry God. He says, I am a  pure eyes that can be hold iniquity. And here he says, my very purity, my very, my very nature  has turned me into someone far more powerfully, far more driven to love you than a mother for an  infant. How could that be?

Here's the answer. Look what he's done. I have engraved you on the palms  of my hands. Now what in the world is that mean? Let's let's break it into two pieces, engraved  palm of the hands.

What is this image getting across? Everything. First of all, engraved. Listen,  there are some perfectly decent words they could have used. Or Isaiah could have used or God could have  used, however they worked this out, which I don't completely understand.

But perfectly good words  for, for, for tattoo, they didn't use them. This isn't, it's not what it's saying. Nothing tattooed. It's not saying written engraved. And the word engraved, you say, what does the word, what it means exactly  what it means in English?

It means to get out a hammer and get out a chisel and to actually cut into  stump something hard. That's weird. Why? Well, first of all, engraved means two things. First of all,  it means permanent.

He's put his name, our names on his hands permanently. They'll never wash off,  they'll never wear off. There's two ways, you know, you put something on your hands. Sometimes  it washes off. Sometimes it just wears off with a lot of heavy use.

Nothing. We'll take our name off his  hands. But it's not just permanent. The word engraved also means artistry. He doesn't say he  chipped it.

Ingraved is a work of art. And it gets at this. What it's getting at is the other place  in the Bible that talks about our names being engraved is back in Exodus 28. In Exodus 28, we're told  the high priest when he goes before God into the tabernacle is wearing an effort, which is a  breastplate. And on the breastplate, there are two precious stones.

They're in a gold. They're  encased in gold. So they're absolutely gorgeous. And on those stones is engraved the names of  the children of Israel. And why?

Well, see, this is the connection between the two. In verse  in chapter 28, it says, why is the high priest doing that? It's very simple. It says in order  to be a perpetual memorial before the Lord. Memorial.

In other words, whenever God minds us, this is  what Exodus 28 say. Whenever God remembers us, whenever God thinks of us, he looks at our names  and he sees a beauty. He says an unbelievable beauty. Now listen, just for a second, this is something  that no other religion, not only no other religion gives you, this is even something that most of us  who erased in Christian churches have never really come to grips with. This is an astonishing  statement.

And grave means the work of art. And this is what God is saying. It is possible  to be in a relationship with me. So you are not just tolerated by me. So you don't just have  access to me.

So that you don't just every so often you're able to come and get things from me. You don't have just a relationship in which when you die, you'll be able to have blessings  and paradise. He is saying, it's possible to be in a relationship with me so that you know that  when I look at you, I'm having an aesthetic experience. And you see the link  when a mother looks at a child because of her very nature, she just drools over the child. Literally.

And God says it's possible to be in a relationship with me so that when I see you,  I'm ravished with your beauty, I can't get over you. I can hardly express the delight, I can hardly  understand. I can't hardly believe I'm just drawn to you. That's the link. We're engraved.

It means we are an aesthetic experience. Here's another way to put it. When God, what do you  look like? Who are you? When it's possible to be in a relationship with God so that you know  this, that when God looks at you, he sees an absolute beauty.

And of course, if God sees you that way,  then that's the definitive view. It doesn't matter what it doesn't matter what your friends say,  it doesn't matter what your parents say, it doesn't matter what the mirror says. It doesn't matter  if you put on five pounds, it doesn't matter. None of those things could pop. This is the ultimate  mind.

This is the ultimate view. This is the ultimate you. And God says, yes, it's possible to be  in a relationship to me so that you're a work of art. When you say, how could that be? And here's  the answer.

It's not, you see, if you go back to Exodus 28, it's almost completely inexplicable. How  in the world could we possibly be something that beautiful? Well, yeah, I see, we're engraved on  these beautiful stones on a high precephal. That's beautiful. It's wonderful.

How, how could that  possibly be? This is ridiculous, maybe you'd say. But here we see something else. Here we see  our names are engraved on his hands. On the palms.

Now, first of all, the palms of the hands means  this is the most visible place. If I, if I would engrave something anywhere else in my body, I might  not see it. But my palms, my hands, I can't help but see it. Secondly, what this means is it means  that absolutely everything he does, the palm is the way you do everything. This is how I move my  mic.

Here's how I look at my watch. Here's how I turn off the light. I have to use my palms. And when  God says, I put your, your name on the palms of my hand, what he's saying is everything I do. I'm doing for you.

It's like a mother. Everything I do, I'm doing for you. No matter what happens,  I'm doing for you. You know, so here's Joseph and his brothers grab him and throw him into a pit. Remember?

And they sell him into slavery to Egypt. And he's down the pit. We're told  back in the passage in Genesis and he's crying out to them. And he's crying out to God. And God  seems like he doesn't remember him, doesn't hear him.

But you see later on, Joseph was able to realize  if God had actually answered my prayer as I made it, I'd be dead now. I never would have become  Prime Minister of Egypt. I never would have run the family relief program. I never would have saved  all those thousands of people. I wouldn't even have saved my own family's physical life.

And I never  would have led my own brothers to repentance. And therefore, they would have been spiritually dead,  they would have been physically dead. In other words, God, when he seemed to not answer my prayer,  was remembering me, everything that happens, everything he does is being done for me. It's amazing. You say, well, but that's not all.

It's not just that it's on the palm of the hands  of the most visible place, not palms of the hands of the most active place, but it's the most vulnerable  place. You see, when somebody says, listen, see, my outstretched palms, this is the trans cultural  sign of vulnerability. If someone says, hands up, come out with your hands up, you don't come out  like this. They'll shoot you. I mean, hands palms means I have no weapon.

A palm means I have to  open my palm to shake, to shake your hand. A palm means appeal, a palm means welcome, a palm means  receive. When my palms are open, I am vulnerable. Now, here's the question, how in the world,  why in the world would someone engrave the palm? That would be, if you're going to put a chisel,  that's just terrible.

That must have hurt terribly. It did. Many centuries later,  somebody came to another doubter, another despondent person, his name was Thomas. And he said to Thomas, look at the palms of my hands. And when you look at Jesus Christ,  look at the palms of his hands to see where your name is, and you will see nail prints.

Why? This is the reason why we're a beauty to him. The reason we're such a beauty to God is because  our names have been engraved in something more precious than stones, more precious than diamonds. The sufferings of Jesus, the nails of Jesus, are the tools with which  our names are engraved on the palms of the hands. And what that means,  finally we have an answer to how 15 can be true. 16,000 is how 15 can be true.

If Jesus Christ has, is our high priest, if he stands before the Father's throne, and he says,  look at what I have done. Look at my suffering. Look at how I've paid for everything. Look at how I've made a sacrifice. Do you know what that means?

Over the years, when I first heard  that Jesus Christ was our high priest, and this is in Hebrews chapter 7, I'll affect the whole book  of Hebrews, and it's in verse 1, chapter 2, where it says that Jesus Christ, it's just an image,  but it's getting a point across. Jesus Christ stands before the throne of God. And he shows  the wounds. And he pleads for us. When I first heard about that, I said, well, that's good,  but it's not completely comforting, because how many times will God finally listen to Jesus about me?

I mean, I keep failing, and I keep failing, and I keep failing, and I guess every day,  Monday morning Jesus will come on up there and say, look, Tim did it again. But for my sake, would you please continue to love him? I see God up there on the throne saying,  well, all right. But that's to miss the whole thrust of everything this whole passage is about. When Jesus Christ stands before the father's throne now, we know this.

He is not, when he says,  love my brothers and sisters. When he pleads for us, he's not demanding, he's not asking for mercy. You know that? He's not asking for mercy. He's demanding justice.

Okay, give me 60 seconds, will you? Jesus Christ is saying this,  thy law, O God, the man's death. For sin, I have paid all their debts. They trusted me,  their debts are paid, and therefore for you to get any punishment from them would be to be getting  two payments. Therefore, O God, all thy holiness, all thy justice, not just thy mercy, not just  thy mercy, not just thy love, all thy holiness, all thy justice, all of your nature demands that you  see them as a beauty.

Every other religion and probably most of you who went to churches, Christian  churches believe the same thing. Every other religion thinks that when it comes to my relationship with  God, it's sort of like a set of scales. You see the set of scales, right? You know, in old courtrooms,  they always have some blind lady or something like that. You know, the blindfold on with the blindfolds  on with the scales.

And what does everybody think? Well, I have good deeds and bad deeds, and if I  have more good deeds and bad deeds of my good deeds, I weigh my bad deeds, then God will deal with me. And Christianity says, the very holiness of God, the very righteousness of God,  compared to which all the mountains of the world and all the planets of the world are like a piece of  dust, are on your side now. That's the reason why first John, if you think I'm exaggerating,  first John 1 verse 8 says, if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins. It doesn't say he's faithful and merciful.

Oh, of course he is, but I didn't say that. If he  would not forgive, if he would not continually accept us, those of us who believed in Jesus Christ,  he would be unjust. And that means his whole nature is now for us. Let me put it to you in a  nutshell. What power could turn the holiness, the righteousness, the vengeance, and the wrath  of God against evil?

What power could turn all that into mother's milk? What power in the whole  universe could change things so that every bit of God's holiness now demands that he loves you  like a mother? It's the cross. There's a hymn that goes, what wondrousness, what mysteries in this  appointment shine, my breaches of the law are his and all his obedience, mine. That's the gospel.

Lay your deadly doing down, down to Jesus' feet, stand in him and him alone, gloriously complete,  and see if you see what he is and then see what he's done. You can start to live as you really are  because the last part of verse 16 says something very simple. What does it say? He says,  thy walls are ever before me. Well, you wait a minute.

Wait a minute. Wait a minute. The walls  are broken. No, they're not. Not in God's mind.

God says, I treat you the way you're going to be. I practice towards you, not the way you look right now, but the way you're going to be. And that's what we're supposed to be doing. It's another way to put it. It's simply this.

We are supposed to also take what he has done for us and say, look, if this is how he sees me,  then that's how I have to see myself. You have to apply this and it will do anything. When you  suffer, what are you supposed to say? Why have you forsaken me? Wait a minute.

Wait a minute. That word forsaken that's used in verse 14 is also used in Psalm 21, verse 1. It's the very same  word Jesus cried on the cross. Jesus Christ is saying, you are not forsaken. I was forsaken.

I was forsaken so that even when you're thrown into pits and you cry out and say, please don't  sell me into slavery, God will never, never forget you. He'll never forget you because he forgot me. And you must never act as if he has. What that means is, when no matter what you're suffering,  you say, this can't be punishment. It's can't be punishment.

It's all fallen into the heart of Jesus. It can't be. When you feel guilty, you have to say, this can't bring me into condemnation. And when you feel disappointment, when you feel discouraged, ultimately discouragement  forsaken is always comes from this. Discouragement and forsakenness means,  I'm sorry.

I know this is going to be vivid, but this is the text. When God says,  you're going to mothers for something only I can give you. There is a milk that your soul needs. It's everlasting love. Mother's love can't be everlasting.

Even the mothers who are great die. And most mothers aren't great. And whatever you're, if you're discouraged and you say,  I'm forsaken, I'm forsaken, it's because there's something that you've made your mother instead of me. There's something that you say, if I have this, then I'm beautiful. You're only beautiful in me.

And that's the reason why he says, if you see in a sense this, no matter what your situation is,  whether it's guilt, whether it's lack of self-control, whether it's suffering, no matter what it is,  you apply this. Apply this. This is the health of my soul. Can I just be honest? This is the health of  my soul.

Not just that in general, I'm living for Jesus, not just in general. He forgives me when I  fall down, but that every fiber of God's attributes are for me. Therefore, the stars will fall from  heaven, but his love for me cannot change. On the basis of that, I have something to stand on. Any other ground is sinking sand, some marsh, and it can be the healthier soul, too.

Here's one  less thing. I did use to have a house in which we had babies. I just remember this. The only time  whenever it was quiet, my gosh, it's quiet. I suddenly realized why.

It's because they were nursing. I mean, it was the only time they ever were, because they can't cry when they're nursing. How quiet is  your soul? This is what God is saying. If your soul's not quiet, if it's restless, if it's a mess,  you don't know what it's like to know who he is, to see what he's done, and to practice who you  are now in him.

Because when you get a handle on that, you finally got the milk. You're finally  your soul's quieted. Let's pray. Our Father, we ask that you would show us how this, how Jesus was  destroyed by justice so that now justice is on our side, and your love for us is indestructible. Would you please show us how that works out?

Would you please show us how we can apply that? Father, this is a strong medicine. It's the most difficult thing for many of us to grab hold on. We try to hold on to it, and we find that we have to beat it into our heads over and over again,  and we lose our orientation towards so quickly. Would you, Lord, tonight, buy your grace and grave  these truths into our hearts deeper than they've ever been engraved so that we can start to practice  who we are and really see what you've done.

We pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.

今天的信息中,提姆·凯勒通过圣经中的故事探讨人的处境,揭示圣经对罪的教导,以及为什么只有圣经的解释才足以让我们面对关于自己的真相。我要给你们读以赛亚书第四十九章的内容。我要读第8节到第16节。这在你们的周刊上。我要读到第16节。

这是主说的话:在悦纳的时候,我应允了你;在拯救的日子,我帮助了你。我要保守你,使你作众民的中保,复兴这地,使人承受荒凉之地为业;对那被掳的说,你们出来吧;对那在黑暗中的说,你们显露吧。他们在路旁吃喝,在各光秃的高处必有牧场。他们不饥不渴,炎热和烈日必不伤害他们,因为怜恤他们的必引导他们,领他们到水泉旁边。我必使我的众山成为大道,我的大路也被修筑。看哪,这些从远方来,这些从北方从西方来,这些从秦国来。诸天哪,应当欢呼!大地啊,应当快乐!众山哪,应当发声歌唱!因为主已经安慰祂的百姓,也要怜恤祂困苦之民。

但锡安说:主离弃了我,主忘记了我。

妇人焉能忘记她吃奶的婴孩,不怜恤她所生的儿子?即或有忘记的,我却不忘记你。看哪,我将你铭刻在我掌上,你的墙垣常在我眼前。就读到这里。

这是上帝的话语。如果你这几周一直来聚会,你知道,这实际上是一个系列讲道的结尾部分,关于圣经对人心出了什么问题,人类出了什么问题,圣经称之为罪的教导。如果你一直在跟随这个系列,你需要知道,这就是终极的医治之法。我们这里所讲的——让我提醒你一下——我们已经在以赛亚书里有一段时间了,我们这里讲的是写给那些即将面临或正在面临流放的人的话。犹太人的耶路撒冷被毁了。

这就是为什么这里讨论锡安的城墙。锡安是圣殿所建的山。因此,锡安这个词可以指耶路撒冷城。有时也可以指圣殿,但关键是,当巴比伦帝国来围攻耶路撒冷并摧毁它时,一切都被拆毁了。耶路撒冷的城墙被拆毁了。

圣殿被拆毁了。百姓被掳到异地为奴。以赛亚给我们的是主对百姓的预言。在这里他在回答,他在回答这个问题。这个问题就是:我们如何面对这一切?

你要对此做什么?现在,从第8节到第13节——我们没有把这一章的全部内容都打印出来——我们看到一个典型的神学论述。通过以赛亚,上帝在说祂要做什么。第1到8节,我们从第8节开始,但第四十九章的第1到8节讲到那位仆人,这位将要来的神秘人物,主的仆人。祂要做什么呢?祂要受苦。

作为祂受苦的结果,我们在第9到12节看到,祂要聚集一个新的民族。祂要创造一个新的群体,从东方和西方而来,原谅我,实际上不是从东方,而是从那边的旷野来,而是从北方、西方和南方来。将会有从黑暗中被带出来的人,被释放的人。所以因为祂的受苦,祂要创造一个新的群体。然后最后,当你读到第13节,这是这个庞大神学论述的高潮,我们被告知,上帝要通过这位仆人在这群人中所做的,将要产生如此大的能力,以至于实际上要救赎整个世界。

因为当你在这里看到,我们看到"诸天哪应当欢呼,大地啊应当快乐,众山哪应当发声歌唱",上帝实际上要更新所有的受造物。无论上帝做什么,都将如此有能力,以至于所有的受造物,天地万物都要被更新。一切都要被带入某种繁荣之中。这就是上帝说祂要做的。这是宏大的。是巨大的。是浩瀚的。而且太宏大,太巨大,太浩瀚了。因为第14节正好打中你的要害。

如果你在跟着读,如果你在通读这一章,在某种程度上,我能看到这一点而你看不到,因为我没有把整章都打印给你。但如果你继续读这一章,上帝在这里说,我要做这个,我要做那个。当然,这至少是颂赞诗,祂呼召大自然因赞美上帝而繁荣。突然第14节来了。

第14节是什么?是什么?听上帝说话的人回应了。他们说了什么?哇吗?不,他们说了什么?

看,我仍然很沮丧。上帝在这里说,哦,看看我要做的所有事情。而经文说什么呢?但锡安说:主离弃了我,主忘记了我。现在我们这里看到的是上帝向百姓作这个神学论述。而百姓的回应是说,说这样的话:我现实生活中的实际情况压倒了这些遥远、抽象、遥不可及的、崇高的应许和宣告。你所有的神学。我所知道的只是锡安破碎了。我的生活破碎了。你怎么能让这种事发生在我身上?

换句话说,上帝在这里作这个伟大的神学论述。而百姓说,我仍然很沮丧。你离弃了我。你忘记了我。我甚至不知道你在说什么,什么天地万物的。我不知道这位仆人是谁。我不知道这里发生了什么。因此我们看到的是工业级的沮丧,人心的沮丧。要让人心感到快乐和被爱是非常困难的。我的意思是,我们中有些人比其他人更糟糕。让我们面对现实吧。但基本上在这里,听着,你对一颗人心说:"你是个耻辱。你是垃圾。你是可鄙的。"

你永远不会忘记那些话。在你的整个生命中永远不会忘记这样的话。但你对一颗人心说:"你很棒,你很了不起。我喜欢你。"

你需要那个。但它消失得太快了。五分钟后,你需要再次听到它。否则你会忘记它。人心尽管有爱的宣告,仍会陷入沮丧之中。

那么上帝做什么呢?我们在这里看到了。这很有趣。在第14节,我们看到有人说,尽管有这些伟大的宣告,我仍然很沮丧。你不爱我。我感觉不到你爱我。我感觉不到你对我的承诺。我们看到上帝如何对待一颗沮丧的心。这很有启发性。上帝如何对待它?

上帝如何对待一个沮丧绝望的人?首先,让我向你展示两个总体原则,然后是三个具体原则:上帝对待一个沮丧抑郁的人的两种总体方式。然后是祂召我们去做的三件非常具体的事情。首先,有两个真正总体的原则,它们是这样的。首先,上帝停下来。这对你来说可能不太容易看出,除非你读整章,但上帝看到祂在路上。祂在谈论事情。祂实际上有,祂,第1到13节真的很精彩,这段论述的结构很精彩。我今晚甚至不打算在这里谈论它,因为我不认为那是我们要,我们不会深入讨论那个。但祂实际上谈到了救恩历史中的三个伟大阶段。

祂从十字架讲到新群体再讲到新创造,从十字架到群体到新创造。真的很精彩。然后突然祂低头说,有什么问题吗?我的意思是,这就像,当然。祂——我要继续说,有什么问题吗?有人举起手说,我很沮丧。

我很沮丧。我不明白你在说什么。我觉得被抛弃了。我觉得一切都结束了。上帝停下来。

因为第15节,第16节,实际上这一章的其余部分。上帝停下祂正在说的话。祂改变了话题,因为他们说,你忘记了我,这一章其余部分的一切都是关于这个想法的。换句话说,上帝,上帝让自己被打断了。祂停下来。

这非常重要。最近我想到我自己的牧养生涯,我意识到无论你是什么性别,无论你是什么种族,无论你多大年纪,我们都以自己独特的方式愚蠢。当我是一个年轻牧师时,我有一种倾向不停下来。当有人沮丧地说话时,有一种倾向就是继续倾倒神学。那么,让我完成我的讲座吧。让我,你知道,你难道不知道,你只是因信称义。你被收养进这个家庭。你将要统治掌权。难道你不知道,你的神学。当你更年轻时,当你是一个更年轻的人,当你是一个更年轻的牧师时,有一种倾向就是说,好吧,我可以解决这个。让我继续进行我的,我的事情。你知道,让我继续倾倒神学。但上帝停下来。现在,另一方面,随着我成为一个更年老的牧师,显然,我意识到我仍然不想停下来,但出于不同的原因。嗯,你知道,现在当你看到某人沮丧时,尽管有所有这些伟大的宣告,现在当你看到有人说,我知道基督教教导什么,我知道圣经说什么,我知道所有这些,我仍然很沮丧。

有一种倾向是低头说,好吧,克服它吧。但你知道,当你年纪大了,你看到人们渡过难关,你会说,来吧,你会挺过去的。这会好起来的。你知道,你在为什么而沉溺?人们遇到过比你更糟糕的问题,你会渡过难关的,我已经经历过。所以当你年轻的时候,有一种倾向不停下来真正倾听,当你年长的时候,有一种倾向不停下来真正倾听。我不知道我什么时候会成为一个好牧师。我确实知道这个。上帝被打断了。祂停下来。

但另一个总体原则是,祂停下来,但祂争论,因为第15和16节是一个论证。第15和16节是好斗的。第15和16节在反驳沮丧的心所说的话,这是一个完美的平衡,因为一方面,祂有同情心停下来,但祂争论。现在,如果你想要一个完美体现这个原则的例子,这个平衡,如果你在处理你自己的沮丧,或别人的沮丧,这个原则最好地体现在诗篇42篇,那里有一位诗人很沮丧,诗人对自己说,他说,我的心哪,你为何忧闷?我的心哪,你为何忧闷?

你为何在我里面烦躁?现在,如果你在这里看,这是完美的平衡,因为一方面,他在倾听一个灵魂。他在倾听他的心。他在说,你烦乱的源头是什么?你忧闷的源头是什么?他在倾听他的心。但另一方面,他在与他的心争论。我的心哪,你为何忧闷?你在那下面做什么?

现在,这就是我所说的原则。在我们继续讨论具体细节之前,这是总体原则。如果你不倾听你的心,你会在心理废墟中。但如果你只倾听你的心,你也会在心理废墟中。如果你不倾听你的心,顺便说一下,我们几乎所有人都会犯这两个错误中的一个。这些错误之一。我们中有些人就是不倾听。我们说,哦,嗯,你知道,你,你,你否认它。你不,你知道,所有那些不安。我不生气。我不,我很好。

我很好。你只是保持忙碌。你不坐下来倾听你的心。你不倾听去找出到底有多糟?它的原因是什么?

所以我们很多人只是,嗯,你知道,我们是那种外向的人,你知道,所以让我们出去做事情吧。你知道,那会,我会没事的。我们不倾听我们的心。另一方面,我们中有些人只做倾听我们的心这件事。我们只是让我们的心说,被离弃,被遗忘,被离弃,被遗忘。你想要化学反应?我被离弃了。我被遗忘了。现在听着,如果你只倾听你的心,你从不对它说话,你从不抓住它说只是真理,你就脱离了现实,伙计。我的意思是,你必须那样做。

如果你从不倾听你的心,如果你只倾听你的心,但看上帝做什么,祂停下来倾听。祂非常认真地对待它,但祂争论。这就是总体原则。然而,祂对一颗沮丧的心做的具体事情是什么?有三件事。

你知道吗?正如我在开头暗示的,这三件事不仅治愈一颗沮丧的心,这是治愈罪恶之心的良方。你知道,被遗忘或被离弃这个词,被离弃这个词更多是一个外在的词。它更多地与"你没有为我挺身而出"有关,但被遗忘这个词更多是一个内在的词,意思是你拒绝了我。被离弃更多地与眼不见为关,被遗忘更多地与心不想有关。被离弃更多地是"你怎么能让这些事情发生在我身上?"被遗忘更多地像是"你拒绝了我,因为有什么问题,不是吗?我不好。"你知道,有时候沮丧更多地由愤怒而非羞耻组成,有时它更多地由羞耻而非愤怒组成,但它们是一对近亲。它们非常非常接近。

有时候很难知道哪个是哪个。所以当上帝来到这颗沮丧的、罪恶的、病态的心时,祂命令三件事。祂呼召我们做三件事。它们都在第15和16节,第15节、16节A和16节B。看,好吧,我只说这三件事是什么。

祂说,想想我是谁。想想我是谁。看看我做了什么。并实践你是谁,好吗?想想我是谁。

看看我做了什么,并实践你是谁。现在,这是三件事。首先,想想我是谁。祂是谁?现在,我们这里有一个上帝刻意选择的比喻,来告诉我们关于祂自己的一些事情。

第15节,妇人焉能忘记她吃奶的婴孩,不怜恤她所生的儿子?即或有忘记的,我却不忘记你。现在,为什么上帝选择一位哺乳的母亲来告诉我们关于祂自己的事情?这不是感情用事。

事实上,这一点也不感情用事。如果你想想,因为祂真的在谈论有时会忘记的母亲。我的意思是,这不是感伤化。这不是在说,哦,没有什么比得上母爱。这不是这里发生的事情,因为有像母爱那样的事情。丈夫和妻子之间的爱肯定同样深刻,真的更丰富,我认为当然也更令人满足。但上帝选择了这种特殊的人际联系来告诉我们关于祂自己的一些令人难以置信的事情。我的意思是,嗯,就是这样。一位哺乳母亲的爱与她的孩子的关系是什么样的,或者这种关系是什么?好的。

这就是重点。一位哺乳母亲对她孩子的爱关系不是那种意志的。它不是有条件的。它不是意志的,也不是有条件的。你爱上某人。你选择那个人。他们选择你。你知道,你做一些事。他们做一些事。如果他们不回报,你就无法继续。

好的。有条件。有意志。有选择,但有一些非常强大和几乎自动的东西。母亲对她孩子的爱是由她的本性驱动的。它是由她的生理驱动的。它是固化在大脑中的。让我给你三个这方面的例子。一位哺乳母亲,首先,一位哺乳母亲与她孩子的关系是严格规律的。顺便说一下,我笑了。马太·亨利是一位清教徒,他在1600年代末,1690年代写了一本注释书。清教徒们,他们有点拘谨。一个男人怎么会知道这个,除非我理解他的妻子有11个孩子?因此,这是他在注释书中说的。一位哺乳母亲,最重要的是,不能不温柔对待她吃奶的孩子,因为如果她忘记了,她自己的乳房很快就会提醒她。这是某件事。顺便说一下,对你们中的一些男士来说,这可能是新闻。除非一位哺乳母亲定期给她的孩子哺乳,除非她释放乳汁,除非她满足她孩子的需要,否则她会痛苦。你的乳房会疼。是的,男人和女人之间的爱。可能有人说,好吧,那是荷尔蒙,但天哪,这是荷尔蒙。你说,好吧,你的荷尔蒙在驱动,但不像这样。每隔这么多小时,如果你不满足这个所爱之人的需要,你就会痛苦,这是令人难以置信的规律,然后其次,它非常温柔和情感化。马太·亨利和我从与哺乳母亲的交谈中了解到的另一件事是,伴随着乳汁而来的是巨大的养育和情感的感觉。有时乳汁带来感觉,有时感觉和思想带来乳汁。

这是生理的一部分,这是荷尔蒙的一部分。这是她是谁的一部分,当她想着爱的思想时,乳汁就来了,这是一种巨大的温柔。她抱起那个婴儿,她看着它的每一处。她看着每一根头发。她看着每一根睫毛。

她被她对这个人的身份所感动,以这种极其详细和温柔的关怀。然后第三,它不仅严格规律。它不仅令人难以置信地情感温柔,而且它是完全无条件的。当你与丈夫或妻子建立关系或者你与某人建立浪漫关系时,必须有一些互惠性。那个人必须做一些回应。我很抱歉。那个人在你的第一次约会时从不说话。你知道,你有过一次糟糕的约会。但这里有一位女士发现自己被她的整个存在驱使着去爱,突然间新妈妈们,这会发生。你的生活停止了。

你生活中的一切都停止了,完全围绕着这个小东西旋转。一周七天,一天25小时,一年365天。而这个孩子甚至不打嗝说谢谢。那些打嗝不是谢谢。所以你可以,你想象它很好,但事实并非如此。孩子什么也不做。孩子,没有条件。孩子做什么,孩子长得怎样都不重要,孩子不配得。这是完全,完全规律的。它是完全温柔的,它是完全无条件的。想象一下上帝选择这个来谈论祂如何与我们建立关系。朋友们,这不是唯一的形象。这不是唯一的形象。当然,我们知道还有其他的来传达这个想法。

但你看到这件事的力量了吗?祂说那就是我与你建立关系的方式。这是我可以给你的一个形象,让你对我多么强烈、多么有力、多么详细、多么无条件地爱你有一些概念。诗篇可以深刻地塑造你接近上帝的方式。即使是耶稣也依靠诗篇来面对每一种情况,包括死亡。

在提姆和凯西·凯勒的365天灵修书《耶稣的诗歌》中,你会找到每日阅读诗篇的内容,并有新鲜的圣经洞察。如果你没有定期的灵修实践,这本书是一个很好的开始方式。如果你已经花时间学习和祷告,那么阅读和祷告诗篇可以帮助你把你最深的情感和问题带到上帝面前,并发现与祂亲密关系的新层次。我们会把提姆和凯西·凯勒的灵修书作为我们对你的礼物的感谢,帮助"福音与生活"与更多人分享耶稣的爱。今天就在gospelandlife.com/give请求你的副本。那就是gospelandlife.com/give。因为你看,当祂说,是的,她可能会忘记。她看到什么?祂在说,祂在说的是,是的,母亲不会忘记。我的意思是,本性只能到此为止。有些女性违背本性。有些女性不这样做。但祂试图说的只是这个。祂说,我对你的爱不仅完全像母亲的自然之爱,而且无限更大。但你难道没有看到真正的要点吗?

祂不仅仅是在说,你看到母爱了吗?我的更有力。你看到母爱了吗?我的更自由和无条件。你看到母爱了吗?

我的爱更详细。难道我没有在诗篇56篇说吗?我知道有多少眼泪流下你的脸颊,即使母亲也不知道。但祂超越了那个。祂试图说,我被我的本性驱使去爱你,就像母亲被驱使去爱她的孩子一样。这是完全自然的。当祂这样说时,现在有许多注释家在这方面帮助了我,他们说,这令人震惊,因为如果你想想,特别是因为,这就是为什么这篇讲道在上周的讲道之后的原因之一,上周的讲道告诉我们关于上帝本性的一些事情。祂是圣洁的。祂是审判者。祂是一位,什么,我们谈论了很多。祂是一位愤怒的上帝。祂对邪恶愤怒。祂是一位极有公义的上帝。鉴于此,你会说什么?如果上帝爱我们,祂肯定是在违背祂的本性。

如果上帝爱我们,当然这很美好,但肯定祂是在违背它。上帝说,不。如果我停止爱你,我就不再是我了。我的一切,我本性的一切都引导我要绝对地、有力地、无条件地、温柔地、情感地、规律地爱你。我受伤。很难相信祂会说,如果我不满足你的需要,我会受伤。这怎么可能?嗯,这是第二点。第一件事祂说,这就是我是谁,但你不明白这怎么可能,除非祂看第二点,看看我做了什么。祂做了什么?

第16节,第一,第一个分句就是祂在说的。看哪?我将你铭刻在我掌上。现在这是我们刚才问的问题的答案。怎么能,怎么,我知道,你们中有些人会感到困惑。我的意思是,上周,整个要点是,这是一位愤怒的上帝。上帝说祂是一位愤怒的上帝。祂说,我是清洁的眼睛,不能看罪孽。在这里祂说,我的纯洁,我的,我的本性使我变成了一个比母亲对婴儿更有力、更被驱使去爱你的人。这怎么可能?

这就是答案。看看祂做了什么。我将你铭刻在我掌上。现在这到底是什么意思?让我们把它分成两部分,铭刻,掌上。这个形象在传达什么?一切。首先,铭刻。听着,有一些完全合适的词他们本可以使用。或者以赛亚本可以使用,或者上帝本可以使用,不管他们怎么解决这个问题,我不完全明白。

但对于纹身来说,有完全合适的词,他们没有使用它们。这不是,这不是它所说的。没有什么纹身。它不是说写上去。铭刻。这个词铭刻,你说,这个词是什么意思,它的意思正好是英语中的意思。它的意思是拿出一把锤子,拿出一把凿子,实际上切入,在某个硬的东西上刻印。那很奇怪。为什么?

嗯,首先,铭刻意味着两件事。首先,它意味着永久。祂把祂的名字,我们的名字永久地放在祂的手上。它们永远不会被洗掉,永远不会被磨损。有两种方式,你知道,你在手上放东西。有时它会被洗掉。有时它只是因大量使用而磨损。

没有什么能把我们的名字从祂手上拿掉。但这不仅仅是永久的。铭刻这个词也意味着艺术性。祂没有说祂凿刻它。铭刻是一件艺术品。它要表达的是。它要表达的是圣经中另一个谈到我们的名字被铭刻的地方,那是在出埃及记28章。在出埃及记28章,我们被告知,当大祭司进到上帝面前进入会幕时,他穿着以弗得,那是一个胸牌。在胸牌上,有两块宝石。它们是金子做的。它们被包裹在金子里。所以它们绝对华丽。在那些石头上铭刻着以色列众子的名字。为什么?

嗯,看,这就是这两者之间的联系。在第28章第16节,它说,大祭司为什么这样做?这很简单。它说是为了在主面前作为永久的纪念。纪念。换句话说,每当上帝想念我们时,这是出埃及记28章说的。每当上帝记得我们时,每当上帝想到我们时,祂看着我们的名字,祂看到一种美。祂说一种难以置信的美。现在听着,就一秒钟,这是其他任何宗教都没有给你的东西,不仅其他宗教没有给你,这甚至是我们大多数在基督教教会长大的人从未真正理解的东西。这是一个令人震惊的声明。

铭刻意味着艺术品。这就是上帝在说的。你有可能与我建立一种关系。所以你不只是被我容忍。所以你不只是有接近我的途径。所以你不只是偶尔能够来从我这里得到东西。你不只是有一种关系,在这种关系中,当你死的时候,你能够在天堂得到祝福。祂在说,你有可能与我建立一种关系,让你知道当我看着你时,我在经历一种审美体验。你看到这种联系了吗?当母亲因她的本性看着孩子时,她只是对孩子垂涎三尺。字面上的。

上帝说,你有可能与我建立一种关系,让当我看到你时,我被你的美所陶醉,我无法克制你。我几乎无法表达这种喜悦,我几乎无法理解。我几乎无法相信,我只是被你吸引。这就是联系。我们被铭刻。这意味着我们是一种审美体验。这是另一种表达方式。当上帝,你看起来像什么?你是谁?有可能与上帝建立一种关系,让你知道这一点,当上帝看着你时,祂看到一种绝对的美。

当然,如果上帝那样看你,那么那就是决定性的观点。不管你的朋友怎么说都无关紧要,不管你的父母怎么说都无关紧要,不管镜子怎么说都无关紧要。不管你是否增加了五磅都无关紧要。这些事情都不重要。这是终极的心智。这是终极的观点。这是终极的你。上帝说,是的,有可能与我建立一种关系,让你成为一件艺术品。当你说,这怎么可能?这就是答案。

这不是,你看,如果你回到出埃及记28章,这几乎是完全无法解释的。我们怎么可能是那么美的东西?嗯,是的,我看到了,我们被铭刻在大祭司胸牌上这些美丽的石头上。那很美。这很美妙。怎么,这怎么可能?这太荒谬了,也许你会说。但在这里我们看到了别的东西。在这里我们看到我们的名字被铭刻在祂的手上。在掌上。

现在,首先,掌上意味着这是最显眼的地方。如果我在我身体的任何其他地方铭刻什么东西,我可能看不到它。但我的掌心,我的手,我不能不看到它。其次,这意味着祂所做的一切,掌心是你做一切事情的方式。这是我移动麦克风的方式。这是我看手表的方式。这是我关灯的方式。我必须用我的掌心。当上帝说,我把你的,你的名字放在我掌心时,祂在说的是我所做的一切。我都是为你而做的。

就像母亲一样。我所做的一切,我都是为你而做的。无论发生什么,我都是为你而做的。你知道,所以这里有约瑟,他的兄弟们抓住他,把他扔进坑里。还记得吗?

他们把他卖到埃及为奴。他在坑里。我们被告知在创世记的那段经文中,他向他们呼求。他向上帝呼求。上帝似乎不记得他,不听他。

但你看,后来约瑟能够意识到,如果上帝真的按照我的祷告回答了我,我现在就死了。我永远不会成为埃及的宰相。我永远不会管理家庭救济计划。我永远不会救那成千上万的人。我甚至不会救我自己家人的性命。

我永远不会带领我自己的兄弟们悔改。因此,他们会在属灵上死去,他们会在身体上死去。换句话说,上帝,当祂似乎不回答我的祷告时,是在记念我,所发生的一切,祂所做的一切都是为我而做的。这令人惊奇。你说,好吧,但那还不是全部。这不仅是在最显眼的地方,不仅是在最活跃的地方,而且是在最脆弱的地方。你看,当有人说,听着,看,我伸出的掌心,这是跨文化的脆弱信号。如果有人说,举起手来,举手出来,你不会这样出来。他们会射杀你。我的意思是,举手掌心朝上意味着我没有武器。

掌心意味着我必须张开手掌来握手,来握你的手。掌心意味着恳求,掌心意味着欢迎,掌心意味着接受。当我的掌心张开时,我是脆弱的。现在,这里有个问题,为什么世界上,为什么世界上有人会在掌心铭刻?那会是,如果你要用凿子,那太可怕了。那一定伤得很厉害。确实如此。许多世纪后,有人来到另一个怀疑者,另一个沮丧的人面前,他的名字叫多马。祂对多马说,看看我掌心。当你看耶稣基督时,看祂掌心,看看你的名字在哪里,你会看到钉痕。

为什么?这就是我们对祂来说是美的原因。我们对上帝来说是如此美丽的原因是因为我们的名字被铭刻在比石头更珍贵、比钻石更珍贵的东西上。耶稣的受苦,耶稣的钉子,是我们的名字被铭刻在掌心的工具。这意味着,最终我们有了第15节如何能成为真实的答案。第16节解释了第15节如何能成为真实。

如果耶稣基督是我们的大祭司,如果祂站在父的宝座前,祂说,看看我所做的。看看我的受苦。看看我如何为一切付出了代价。看看我如何献上了祭。你知道这意味着什么吗?

多年来,当我第一次听说耶稣基督是我们的大祭司,这是在希伯来书第7章,我会影响整本希伯来书的书,这是在第1节,第2章,那里说耶稣基督,这只是一个形象,但它在传达一个要点。耶稣基督站在上帝的宝座前。祂展示伤口。祂为我们恳求。当我第一次听说这个时,我说,嗯,那很好,但不完全令人安慰,因为上帝最终会听耶稣关于我的话多少次?

我的意思是,我不断失败,我不断失败,我不断失败,我想每天,星期一早上耶稣会来到那里说,看,提姆又做了。但看在我的份上,你能请继续爱他吗?我看到上帝在那宝座上说,好吧,好吧。但这是错过了这整段经文的全部要旨。当耶稣基督现在站在父的宝座前时,我们知道这一点。当祂说,爱我的弟兄姊妹时。当祂为我们恳求时,祂不是在要求,祂不是在求怜悯。你知道吗?祂不是在求怜悯。祂在要求公义。

好吧,给我60秒,好吗?耶稣基督在说这个,你的律法,哦上帝,要求死亡。因为罪,我已经付清了他们所有的债。他们信靠我,他们的债已经付清了,因此你要对他们施以任何惩罚就是要得到两次付款。因此,哦上帝,你所有的圣洁,你所有的公义,不仅是你的怜悯,不仅是你的怜悯,不仅是你的爱,你所有的圣洁,你所有的公义,你本性的一切都要求你把他们看作美丽。每一个其他宗教,可能你们大多数去基督教会的人都相信同样的事情。每一个其他宗教都认为,当涉及到我与上帝的关系时,它有点像一套天平。你看到那套天平了,对吧?你知道,在旧法庭里,他们总是有一些蒙眼的女士之类的。你知道,蒙着眼睛拿着天平。每个人都怎么想?嗯,我有善行和恶行,如果我有更多的善行和恶行,如果我的善行超过我的恶行,那么上帝就会对待我。基督教说,上帝的圣洁,上帝的公义,与之相比,世界上所有的山和世界上所有的行星都像一粒尘埃,现在都在你这边。这就是为什么约翰一书,如果你认为我在夸大,约翰一书第1章第8节说,我们若认自己的罪,祂是信实的,是公义的,必要赦免我们的罪。它没有说祂是信实和怜悯的。

哦,祂当然是,但我没有那样说。如果祂不宽恕,如果祂不持续接纳我们,我们这些相信耶稣基督的人,祂就是不公义的。这意味着祂整个本性现在都为我们。让我简而言之给你。什么力量能把上帝对邪恶的圣洁、公义、报复和愤怒转变过来?

什么力量能把所有这些变成母乳?整个宇宙中什么力量能改变事物,使上帝的每一点圣洁现在都要求祂像母亲一样爱你?是十字架。有一首赞美诗这样唱,何等奇妙,何等奥秘在这任命中闪耀,我违背律法的是祂的,而祂所有的顺服是我的。那就是福音。

放下你致命的行为,放下到耶稣的脚前,站在祂里面,单单在祂里面,荣耀地完全,看看如果你看到祂是什么,然后看到祂做了什么。你可以开始按照你真正的样子生活,因为第16节的最后部分说了一些非常简单的事情。它说什么?祂说,你的墙垣常在我眼前。嗯,你等等。等等。等等。墙垣破碎了。不,它们没有。在上帝的心意中没有。

上帝说,我按照你将要成为的样子对待你。我对你的实践,不是按照你现在的样子,而是按照你将要成为的样子。这就是我们应该做的。这是另一种表达方式。就是这样简单。我们也应该把祂为我们所做的拿来说,看,如果这就是祂看我的方式,那么这就是我必须看自己的方式。你必须应用这个,它会做任何事。当你受苦时,你应该说什么?你为什么离弃我?等等。等等。

在第14节使用的那个被离弃的词也用在诗篇21篇第1节。这是耶稣在十字架上呼喊的同一个词。耶稣基督在说,你没有被离弃。我被离弃了。我被离弃了,所以即使当你被扔进坑里,你呼求说,请不要把我卖到奴隶制中,上帝永远,永远不会忘记你。祂永远不会忘记你,因为祂忘记了我。你永远不要表现得好像祂忘记了。这意味着,无论你遭受什么,你说,这不可能是惩罚。它不可能是惩罚。

它都落入了耶稣的心中。不可能是。当你感到内疚时,你必须说,这不能使我陷入定罪。当你感到失望,当你感到沮丧时,最终沮丧,被离弃总是来自于此。沮丧和被离弃意味着,对不起。我知道这会很生动,但这是经文。当上帝说,你要去母亲那里寻求只有我能给你的东西。有一种你的灵魂需要的乳汁。那是永恒的爱。母爱不可能是永恒的。

即使是伟大的母亲也会死。而大多数母亲并不伟大。无论你的,如果你沮丧,你说,我被离弃了,我被离弃了,那是因为有某样东西你把它当成了你的母亲而不是我。有某样东西你说,如果我有这个,那么我就美丽了。你只在我里面是美丽的。

这就是为什么祂说,如果你从某种意义上看到这个,无论你的处境如何,无论是内疚,无论是缺乏自制,无论是受苦,无论是什么,你应用这个。应用这个。这是我灵魂的健康。我能诚实地说吗?这是我灵魂的健康。

不仅仅是一般意义上,我为耶稣而活,不仅仅是一般意义上。祂在我跌倒时赦免我,而是上帝属性的每一根纤维都为我。因此,星星会从天上掉下来,但祂对我的爱不能改变。在这个基础上,我有东西可以站立。任何其他根基都是流沙,某种沼泽,它可以是更健康的灵魂。

这是最后一件事。我以前有一所房子,里面有婴儿。我只记得这个。唯一一次无论什么时候安静了,我的天哪,安静了。我突然意识到为什么。那是因为他们在哺乳。我的意思是,那是他们唯一安静的时候,因为当他们在哺乳时他们不能哭。你的灵魂多么安静?这就是上帝在说的。如果你的灵魂不安静,如果它不安宁,如果它一团糟,你不知道认识祂是谁,看到祂所做的,并实践你现在在祂里面是谁是什么样子的。

因为当你掌握了那个,你终于得到了乳汁。你的灵魂终于安静了。让我们祷告。我们的父,我们祈求你向我们显明这一点,耶稣如何被公义毁灭,以至于现在公义在我们这边,你对我们的爱是坚不可摧的。你能请向我们显明这是如何运作的吗?

你能请向我们显明我们如何能应用那个吗?父啊,这是强效药。这是我们许多人最难抓住的东西。我们试图抓住它,我们发现我们必须一遍又一遍地把它打入我们的头脑,我们如此迅速地失去了我们的方向。主啊,今晚,你能买你的恩典,把这些真理铭刻在我们心中,比它们曾经被铭刻的更深吗?这样我们就可以开始实践我们是谁,真正看到你所做的。

我们奉耶稣的名祈求这个。阿门。

在今天的信息中，提姆·凯勒通过圣经中的故事探讨人类的处境，揭示圣经对罪的论述，以及为什么这是唯一足够深刻的解释来面对我们自己的真相。我要给你们读以赛亚书第49章的经文。我要读第8节到第16节。这在你们的周报上。我要读到第16节。

耶和华如此说：在悦纳的时候，我应允了你；在拯救的日子，我帮助了你。我要保护你，使你作众民的中保，复兴遍地，使人承受荒凉之地为业；对那被掳的人说：出来吧！对那在黑暗的人说：显露吧！他们在路上必得饮食，在各荒山上必有牧场。他们必不饥不渴，炎热和烈日必不伤害他们。

因为怜恤他们的必引导他们，领他们到水泉旁边。我必使我的众山成为大道，我的大路也被修高。看哪，这些从远方来，这些从北方、从西方来，这些从希尼地来。诸天哪，应当欢呼！大地啊，应当快乐！众山哪，应当发声歌唱！因为耶和华已经安慰他的百姓，也要怜恤他困苦之民。锡安说：耶和华离弃了我，主忘记了我。

妇人焉能忘记她吃奶的婴孩，不怜恤她所生的儿子？即或有忘记的，我却不忘记你。看哪，我将你铭刻在我掌上；你的墙垣常在我眼前。让我们在这里结束。

这是神的话语。现在，如果你这几周一直在来，你知道，这实际上是一个系列的结尾，讲的是圣经对人心的问题、人类的问题有什么看法，就是圣经所说的罪。如果你参加了这个系列，你需要知道，如果你一直跟随这个系列，这就是终极的解决之道。好吧，我们这里实际上有，让我提醒你，我们已经在以赛亚书里待了一段时间了，我们这里有的是写给那些将要面对或正在面对流亡的人们的。犹太人的耶路撒冷被毁了。

这就是为什么这里讨论到

锡安的城墙。锡安是建造圣殿的山。因此，锡安这个词可以指耶路撒冷城。它有时也可以指圣殿，但关键是当巴比伦帝国来围困耶路撒冷并摧毁它时，一切都被拆毁了。耶路撒冷的城墙被拆毁了。

圣殿被拆毁了。百姓被掳到流亡之地。以赛亚给我们的是主对百姓的预言。在这里他正在回答一个问题。这个问题将是：我们如何面对这一切？

你们要如何应对这一切？现在，直到第13节，我们在这一章中没有全部印出来，我们有一个典型的神学论述。以赛亚通过以赛亚书，神说他将要做什么。第49章的第1到8节，我们从第8节开始，但第1到8节讲的是仆人，这个将要来的神秘人物，主的仆人。他要做的是受苦。

由于这苦难，我们在第9到12节中看到，他将要聚集一群新的百姓。他要从东方和西方，实际上不是从东方，而是从那边的旷野，还有从北方、西方和南方创造一个新的群体。将会有一群从黑暗中被带出来的人，被释放的人。因此，由于他的受苦，他将要创造一个新的群体。最后，当你读到第13节，这是高潮，这个巨大的神学论述，我们被告知，神将要通过这位仆人和这群百姓所成就的，将有如此大的能力，以至于要救赎整个世界。

因为当你在这里看到，我们看到欢呼吧诸天，或大地迸发歌声，或群山，神实际上要更新整个创造界。当你看到这里，欢呼吧诸天，歌唱吧大地，群山啊要发声歌唱，神实际上要更新所有的受造之物。神所做的任何事都将如此有力，以至于所有的受造之物，诸天和大地就是一切，都将被更新。一切都将焕发某种生机。这就是神说他要做的。

它广阔无边。它巨大。它浩瀚。而且它太广阔了

它太巨大了，太浩瀚了。因为第14节就这样直击你的眉心。

如果你正在跟着读，如果你在通读整章，在某种程度上，我能看到你看不到的东西，因为我没有把整章都打印给你们。但如果你继续往下读这一章，你会看到神在说，我要做这个。我要做那个。这当然至少是颂赞式的表达，他在呼唤大自然开花赞美神。突然间第14节出现了。

第14节是什么？它是什么？聆听神话语的人们做出了回应。他们说了什么？哇？不，他们说了什么？

看，我仍然很沮丧。这里神在说，哦，看看我将要做的所有事情。但经文说，锡安却说，耶和华离弃了我，主忘记了我。现在你在这里看到的是神向百姓发表这篇神学论述。

而百姓的回应是说，是这样说的，我当下生活的现实压倒了那些遥远的、抽象的、遥不可及的、崇高的应许和宣告。你所有的神学。我所知道的只是锡安已经破败了。我的生活已经破碎了。你怎么能让这种事发生在我身上？

换句话说，这里神在发表这伟大的神学论述。而百姓说，我仍然很沮丧。你离弃了我。你忘记了我。我甚至不知道你在说什么诸天和大地。

我不知道这仆人是谁。我不知道这里在讲什么。因此我们在这里看到的是工业级强度的沮丧，这就是人心。要让人心感到快乐和被爱是非常困难的。我的意思是，我们有些人比其他人更糟。

让我们面对现实吧。但基本上，听着，你对一颗人心说。你是个耻辱。你是垃圾。你很可鄙。

你永远不会忘记那些话。你一生中永远都不会忘记那样的话。但你对一颗人心说，你很棒，你很伟大。我喜欢你。

你需要这些话。但它们消散得如此之快。五分钟后，你又需要再听一次。否则你就会忘记。尽管有爱的宣告，人心仍会陷入沮丧。

那么神做了什么？我们在这里看到了。这很有趣。在第14节，我们看到有人在说

尽管有这些伟大的宣告，我仍然感到沮丧。你不爱我。

我感觉不到你离开了我。我感觉不到你对我的承诺。我们看到神如何应对一颗绝望的心。这是相当有启发性的。神如何应对？

神如何应对一个沮丧绝望的人？首先，让我向你展示两个一般性原则，然后是三个具体原则——神与沮丧抑郁的人一起工作的两个一般方式，然后是他要我们做的三件非常具体的事情。首先，有两个真正的一般性原则，它们是这样的。首先，神停下来。

除非你读了整章，否则这一点可能不太容易看出来。但神看到了他的方式。他在谈论事情。而且他实际上，第1到13节真的很精彩，这段论述的结构很精彩。我今晚甚至不打算在这里谈论它，因为我认为那不是我们要关注的内容。但他实际上谈到了救恩历史中的三个伟大阶段。

他从十字架到新群体再到新创造，从十字架到群体再到新创造。真的很精彩。然后突然他低头看说，有什么问题吗？我的意思是，这就像当然。他说我要继续，有什么问题吗？有人举起手说，我很沮丧。

我很绝望。我不明白你在说什么。我感到被抛弃。我觉得一切都结束了。神停下来。

因为第15节，第16节，实际上本章的其余部分。神停下了他正在说的话。他改变了话题，因为他们说，你忘记了我，而本章其余部分都是关于这个想法的。换句话说，神允许自己被打断。他停下来。

这非常重要。最近我有一个，当我想到自己的牧养生涯时，我意识到无论你是什么性别，无论你是什么种族，无论你多大年龄，我们都以自己特殊的方式愚蠢。当我还是一个年轻的牧师时，我有一种不停下来的倾向。当有人沮丧地说话时，有一种倾向就是继续倾倒

在神学上。所以，好吧，让我完成我的讲课。

让我，你知道，难道你不知道吗，你只是因信而战。你被收养进入这个家庭。你将要统治和掌权。难道你不知道吗，你的神学。当你年轻的时候，当你是一个年轻的乐队，当你是一个年轻的牧师时，有一种倾向就是说，好吧，我可以解决这个问题。

让我继续进行我的，我的事情。你知道，让我只是倾注神学。但神停下来了。现在，另一方面，随着我成为一名年长的牧师，这是显而易见的，我意识到我仍然不想停下来，但原因不同了。好吧，你知道，现在当你看到有人沮丧时，尽管有所有这些伟大的宣告，现在当你看到有人说，我知道基督教教导什么，我知道圣经说什么，我知道所有这些，我仍然很沮丧。

有一种倾向是低头说，好吧，克服它吧。但你知道，当你年长时，你已经看到人们渡过难关，你会说，来吧，你会挺过去的。这会没事的。你知道，你在自怜什么呢？有些人遇到的问题比你的问题严重得多，而你会渡过难关的，我也经历过。

所以当你年轻时，有一种倾向是不停下来真正倾听，而当你年长时，也有一种倾向是不停下来真正倾听。我不知道我什么时候会成为一名好牧师。我确实知道这一点。神被打断了。他停下来了。

但另一个普遍原则是，他停下来了，但他在辩论，因为第15节和第16节是一个论证。第15节和第16节是好斗的。第15节和第16节是在反驳沮丧的心所说的话，这是一个完美的平衡，因为另一方面，他有同情心停下来，但他在辩论。现在，如果你想要这个原则的一个完美例子，这个你必须拥有的平衡，如果你正在处理自己的沮丧，或者别人的沮丧，这个原则最好体现在诗篇42篇中，那里有一位诗人感到沮丧，诗人对自己说，他说，我的心哪，你为何忧闷？我的心哪，你为何忧闷？

为什么与他一起？现在，如果你看这里，这是完美的平衡，因为一方面，他在倾听一个灵魂。他在

倾听他的内心。他在说，你不安的源头是什么？你沮丧的源头是什么？

他在倾听自己的内心。但另一方面，他在与自己的内心争辩。我的灵魂啊，你为何如此沮丧？你在那里做什么？现在，这就是我要说的原则。

在我们继续讨论具体内容之前，这是一个总的原则。如果你不倾听你的内心，你会陷入心理崩溃。但如果你只是倾听你的内心，你也会陷入心理崩溃。如果你不倾听你的内心，顺便说一句，我们几乎所有人都会犯这两种错误之一。这些错误之一。

我们有些人就是不倾听。我们说，哦，好吧，你知道的，你，你，你否认它。你不，你知道，所有那些烦恼。我没有生气。我没有，我很好。

我很好。然后你只是保持忙碌。你不坐下来倾听你的内心。你不倾听去弄清楚到底有多糟？原因是什么？

所以我们很多人只是，嗯，你知道，我们有点外向，你知道，所以让我们出去做些事情。你知道，那会，我会没事的。我们不倾听自己的内心。另一方面，我们有些人除了倾听内心什么都不做。我们只是让内心发号施令，被遗弃，被遗忘，被遗弃，被遗忘。

你要化学反应吗？我被遗弃了。我被遗忘了。现在听着，如果你只是倾听你的内心，你从不与它对话，你从不抓住它说出真相，朋友，你就脱离了现实。我的意思是，你必须这样做。

如果你不这样做，如果你从不倾听你的内心，如果你只是倾听你的内心，但是看看神做了什么，他停下来倾听。他非常认真地对待它，但他会争辩。这就是总的原则。然而，他对沮丧的内心具体做了什么？有三件事。

你知道吗？正如我在开始时暗示的，这三件事不仅能治愈沮丧的内心，这也是治愈罪恶之心的良方。你知道，被遗忘或被遗弃这个词，被遗弃这个词是一个比较外在的词。它更多地与你没有为我做到有关，但被遗忘这个词更多是一个内在的词，意思是你拒绝了我。因为

被遗弃更多是看不见和被忘记，更多是心不在焉。

被遗弃，更多是"你怎么能让这些事情发生在我身上？"被忘记更像是你拒绝了我，因为有些地方不对，不是吗？我不好。你知道，有时候沮丧更多是由愤怒而不是羞耻构成的，有时候它更多是由羞耻而不是愤怒构成的，但它们是近亲。它们非常非常接近。

有时候很难知道哪个是哪个。所以当神来到沮丧、有罪、病态的心面前时，祂吩咐三件事。祂呼召我们做三件事。它们都在15节和16节，15节、16节A和16节B。看，我只说这三件事是什么。

祂说，想想你是谁。想想我是谁。看看我做了什么。并且实践你是谁，好吗？想想我是谁。看看我做了什么，并且实践你是谁。现在，这是三点。首先，想想我是谁。祂是谁？现在，我们这里有一个比喻，神特意选择来告诉我们关于祂自己的一些事情。

15节，母亲岂能忘记她怀中吃奶的婴孩，不怜悯她所生的儿子吗？她或许会忘记，但我却不忘记你。现在，为什么神选择一位哺乳的母亲来告诉我们关于祂自己的事情？这不是感伤的。

事实上，这一点也不感伤。如果你想一想，因为祂实际上是在谈论有时会忘记的母亲。我的意思是，这不是感伤化。这不是一种说法，哦，没有什么比得上母爱。这里不是这样的，因为有些东西像母爱一样。丈夫和妻子之间的爱当然一样深厚，实际上更丰富，我认为肯定更令人满足。但神选择了这种特殊的人类连接来告诉我们关于祂自己的一些不可思议的事情。我的意思是，好吧，是这样的。哺乳的母亲是什么样的，或者与什么的关系，这是什么？好的。

这是重点。哺乳母亲对她孩子的爱的关系不是那么意志性的。它不是有条件的。它不是意志性和有条件的。你爱上某个人。你选择那个人。

他们选择你。你知道，你做些什么。他们做些什么。如果他们不回应，你就无法继续下去。

好的。这里有条件。有意志。有选择，但有一种极其强大且几乎是自动的东西。母亲对孩子的爱是由她的本性驱动的。

它是由她的生理驱动的。这是与生俱来的。让我给你举三个例子。首先是哺乳期的母亲，哺乳期母亲与她孩子的关系是严格规律的。顺便说一句，我笑了。

马太·亨利是一位清教徒，他在1600年代末，1690年代写了一本注释书。清教徒们有点古板。一个男人怎么会知道这些，除非我知道他的妻子有11个孩子？因此，这就是他在注释中所说的。哺乳期的母亲，尤其是，不可能不温柔地对待她吃奶的孩子，因为如果她忘记了，她自己的乳房很快就会提醒她。

这里有件事。顺便说一句，对于你们一些男士来说，这可能是个新闻。除非哺乳期的母亲定期给孩子喂奶，除非她释放乳汁，除非她满足孩子的需要，否则她会感到疼痛。你的乳房会疼。是的，男人和女人之间的爱。

那可能是人们说的，嗯，那是荷尔蒙，但天哪，这就是荷尔蒙。你说，你的荷尔蒙在驱动，但不像这样。每隔几个小时，如果你不满足这个所爱之人的需要，你就会感到疼痛，这是令人难以置信的规律，其次，它是极其温柔和充满情感的。马太·亨利和我从与哺乳期母亲交谈中了解到的另一件事是，随着乳汁而来的是巨大的养育和情感的感受。有时是乳汁带来感受，有时是感受和想法带来乳汁。

这是生理的一部分，是荷尔蒙的一部分。这是她本质的一部分，当她想着充满爱的想法时，乳汁就来了，这是一种巨大的温柔。她抱起那个婴儿，她看着它的每一个细节。她看着每一根头发。她看着每一根睫毛。

她被自己的本性所感动，给予这种极其细致和温柔的照顾。然后第三，它不仅是严格规律的。它不

令人难以置信地情感细腻，但它是完全无条件的。当你与丈夫或妻子建立关系，或者与某人产生浪漫关系时，必须有一些互惠。那个人必须有所回应。

对不起。那个人在你的第一次约会中甚至从不说话。你知道，你经历过一次糟糕的约会。但这里有一位女性，她发现自己被自己的本性驱使着去爱，突然之间新妈妈，这种情况发生了。你的生活停止了。

你生活中的一切都停止了，完全围绕着这个小东西旋转。一周七天，一天二十五小时，一周七天，一年三百六十五天。而这个孩子甚至不会打嗝说谢谢。那些打嗝不是谢谢。

所以你可以，你想象得很好，但事实并非如此。孩子什么都不做。孩子，没有任何条件。孩子做什么、孩子长什么样都不重要，孩子并不配得。这是完完全全的、完全的规律。

它是完全细腻的，并且是完全无条件的。想象一下，神选择用这个来谈论祂如何与我们建立关系。朋友们，这不是唯一的形象。这不是唯一的形象。当然，我们知道还有其他的形象来传达这个想法。

但你看到这个比喻的力量了吗？祂说这就是我与你建立关系的方式。这是我能给你的一个形象，让你对我如何强烈地、如何有力地、如何详细地、如何无条件地爱你有一些概念。诗篇可以深刻地塑造你接近神的方式。甚至耶稣也依靠诗篇来面对每一种情况，包括死亡。

那是gospelandlife.com斜杠give。因为你看，当他说，是的，她可能会忘记。她看到什么？他在说，他所说的是，是的，母亲不会忘记。我的意思是，天性只能到此为止。

有些女人违背天性。有些女人不这样做。但他想说的只是这个。他说，我对你的爱不仅完全像母亲的天然之爱，而且是无限更伟大的。但你没看到真正的要点吗？

他不只是在说，你看到母亲的爱了吗？我的更强大。你看到母亲的爱了吗？我的更自由和无条件。你看到母亲的爱了吗？

我的爱更细致。我不是在诗篇56篇中说过吗？我知道有多少眼泪正从你的脸颊滑落，即使母亲也不知道这些。但他超越了这些。他想说的是，我被我的本性所驱使去爱你，就像母亲被驱使去爱她的孩子一样。

这是完全自然的。当他说这话时，现在有许多注释家在这方面帮助了我，他们说，这是令人震惊的，因为如果你仔细想想，尤其是，这是为什么这篇讲道在上周讲道之后的原因之一，上周的讲道告诉我们一些关于神的本性的事情。他是圣洁的。他是审判者。他是一个，什么，我们谈论了很多。

他是一位愤怒的神。他对邪恶感到愤怒。他是一位有着极大公义的神。鉴于此，你会怎么说？如果神爱我们，他肯定是在违背他的本性。

如果神爱我们，那当然是美好的，但他肯定是在违背它。而神说，不。如果我停止爱你，我就不再是我了。关于我的一切，关于我本性的一切，都引导我去绝对地、强有力地、无条件地、温柔地、情感地、持续地爱。我受伤。

很难相信他会说，如果我不满足你的需要，我会受伤。这怎么可能呢？嗯，这是第二点。他说的第一件事是，这就是我是谁，但你不明白这怎么可能，除非他其次看看，看我做了什么。他做了什么呢？

第16节，第一个，因为第一个分句就是他所说的。看？我已经将你铭刻在我的手掌上。现在这就是我们刚才所问问题的答案。怎么可能，怎么，我

你们知道，你们有些人可能会感到困惑。

我是说，上周，整个重点是，这是一位愤怒的神。神说他是一位愤怒的神。他说，我的眼目清洁，不能看罪孽。而在这里他说，我的纯洁本质，我的本性，已经使我成为一个远比母亲对婴儿更强烈、更驱动去爱你的存在。这怎么可能呢？

答案在这里。看他做了什么。我已将你铭刻在我掌上。这到底是什么意思？让我们把它分成两部分，铭刻，掌心。

这个意象传达了什么？一切。首先，铭刻。听着，有一些完全合适的词语可以使用。或者以赛亚可以用，或者神可以用，不管他们是如何做到这一点的，我不完全理解。

但对于纹身来说，有完全合适的词语，他们没有使用这些词。这不是，这不是它所说的意思。没有说纹身。也没有说写上。是铭刻。而铭刻这个词，你说，这个词是什么意思，它的意思恰恰就是英文中的意思？

它的意思是拿起锤子，拿起凿子，实际上在某种坚硬的东西上凿刻。这很奇怪。为什么？首先，铭刻意味着两件事。首先，它意味着永久。

他把我们的名字永久地放在他的手上。它们永远不会被洗掉，永远不会磨损。你知道，你在手上放东西有两种方式。有时它会被洗掉。有时只是因为大量使用而磨损。

没有任何东西能从他的手上除去我们的名字。但这不仅仅是永久的。铭刻这个词也意味着艺术性。他没有说他凿刻它。

铭刻是一件艺术品。它传达的是这样的意思。圣经中其他提到我们的名字被铭刻的地方是在出埃及记28章。在出埃及记28章，我们被告知大祭司进入会幕到神面前时，穿着以弗得，就是一件胸牌。胸牌上有两块宝石。

它们镶嵌在金子里。所以它们绝对华丽。在那些石头上铭刻着以色列子民的名字。为什么呢？

你看，这就是两者之间的联系。在第28章的经文中说，为什么大祭司要这样做？这非常简单。经文说是为了在耶和华面前作为永远的纪念。纪念。

换句话说，每当神记念我们时，这就是出埃及记28章所说的。每当神记念我们，每当神想到我们，他看着我们的名字，他就看到一种美。他说那是一种难以置信的美。现在听着，就一下子，这是其他任何宗教都无法给你的东西，不仅其他宗教无法给你，这甚至是我们这些在基督教会中长大的人大多数从未真正领会的东西。这是一个令人惊讶的宣告。

雕刻意味着艺术品。这就是神所说的。有可能与我建立这样一种关系。所以你不仅仅是被我容忍。所以你不仅仅是能接近我。

所以你不仅仅是偶尔能够来从我这里得到东西。你不仅仅拥有一种当你死后能够获得祝福和天堂的关系。他是在说，有可能与我建立这样一种关系，让你知道当我看着你时，我正在经历一种美学体验。你看到这个联系了吗？当一个母亲看着孩子时，因为她的本性，她会对孩子垂涎欲滴。真的是这样。

神说，有可能与我建立这样一种关系，让你知道当我看到你时，我被你的美所吸引，我无法自拔。我几乎无法表达这种喜悦，我几乎无法理解。我简直不敢相信，我就是被你吸引。这就是联系。我们被雕刻。

这意味着我们是一种美学体验。这里有另一种表达方式。当神——你看起来像什么？你是谁？有可能与神建立这样一种关系，让你知道这一点，就是当神看着你时，他看到的是绝对的美。

当然，如果神这样看你，那么这就是决定性的观点。你朋友说什么都不重要，你父母说什么都不重要，镜子说什么都不重要。你是否胖了五磅都不重要，什么都不重要。这些东西都无法动摇。这是终极的意念。

这就是

终极的景象。这是终极的你。上帝说，是的，你有可能与我建立这样一种关系，使你成为一件艺术品。当你说，这怎么可能呢？答案就在这里。

你看，如果你回到出埃及记28章，这几乎是完全无法解释的。我们怎么可能会是那么美丽的东西呢？是的，我明白了，我们被刻在高贵的胸牌上这些美丽的宝石上。那很美丽。很奇妙。

这怎么可能呢？这太荒谬了，你也许会这么说。但在这里我们看到了别的东西。在这里我们看到我们的名字被刻在他的手上。刻在手掌上。

首先，手掌意味着这是最显眼的地方。如果我在身体其他任何地方刻上什么东西，我可能看不到它。但我的手掌，我的双手，我不可能看不到它。其次，这意味着他所做的一切——手掌是你做一切事情的方式。我就是这样移动麦克风的。

我就是这样看手表的。我就是这样关灯的。我必须用我的手掌。当上帝说，我把你的名字刻在我的手掌上时，他在说的是我所做的一切，我都是为你而做的。

这就像一位母亲。我所做的一切，都是为你而做的。无论发生什么，我都是为你而做的。你知道，约瑟的故事——他的兄弟们抓住他，把他扔进坑里。记得吗？

他们把他卖到埃及做奴隶。他在坑里。创世记的那段经文告诉我们，他向他们呼求。他向上帝呼求。而上帝似乎不记得他，没有听见他。

但你看，后来约瑟能够意识到，如果上帝真的按照我所祈求的方式回应了我的祷告，我现在就死了。我永远不会成为埃及的宰相。我永远不会主持家庭救济计划。我永远不会拯救成千上万的人。我甚至不会拯救我自己家人的生命。

我也永远不会带领我的兄弟们悔改。因此，他们在灵性上会死亡，在肉体上也会死亡。换句话说，上帝在看似没有回应我的祷告时，其实是在记念我，所有的事情

当这种情况发生时,他所做的一切都是为我而做的。这太奇妙了。你说,好吧,但这还不是全部。

这不仅仅是因为它在手掌上——最显眼的地方,不是手掌——最活跃的地方,而是最脆弱的地方。你看,当有人说,听着,看,我张开的手掌,这是跨文化的脆弱标志。如果有人说,举起手来,举着手出来,你不会像这样出来。他们会射杀你。我的意思是,手掌朝外意味着我没有武器。

手掌意味着我必须张开手掌来握手,来和你握手。手掌意味着恳求,手掌意味着欢迎,手掌意味着接纳。当我的手掌张开时,我是脆弱的。现在,问题来了,到底为什么,到底为什么有人会在手掌上雕刻?如果你要拿凿子,那太可怕了。

那一定非常痛苦。确实如此。许多个世纪之后,有人来到另一个怀疑者,另一个沮丧的人面前,他的名字叫多马。他对多马说,看我手掌。当你看耶稣基督时,看他手掌,看你的名字在哪里,你会看到钉痕。

为什么?这就是为什么我们对他来说是美丽的。我们对神来说如此美丽的原因是因为我们的名字被铭刻在比宝石更珍贵、比钻石更珍贵的东西上。耶稣的苦难,耶稣的钉子,是将我们的名字铭刻在手掌上的工具。这意味着什么?最终我们找到了第15节如何成真的答案。第16节是第15节如何成真的方式。

如果耶稣基督是我们的大祭司,如果他站在父神的宝座前,他说,看我所做的。看我的苦难。看我如何为一切付上代价。看我如何献上祭物。你知道这意味着什么吗?

这些年来,当我第一次听说耶稣基督是我们的大祭司,这在希伯来书第7章,我会影响整卷希伯来书,在第2章第1节,那里说耶稣基督,这只是一个形象,但它在传达一个要点。耶稣基督站在神的宝座前。他显出

伤口。他为我们代求。当我第一次听到这个的时候，我说，嗯，这很好，但这并不完全让人感到安慰，因为神到底会为我听耶稣说多少次呢？

我的意思是，我不断失败，不断失败，不断失败，我猜每天，星期一早上耶稣都会上到那里说，看，提姆又做错了。但看在我的份上，你能否请继续爱他？我看到神在那宝座上说，好吧，就这样吧。但这完全错失了整段经文所要表达的全部要旨。当耶稣基督现在站在父的宝座前时，我们知道这一点。

当他说，爱我的弟兄姊妹时，他不是在要求。当他为我们代求时，他不是在请求怜悯。你知道吗？他不是在请求怜悯。他是在要求公义。

好的，给我60秒时间，好吗？耶稣基督是这样说的，你的律法，神啊，人的死。为了罪，我已经付清了他们所有的债务。他们信靠我，他们的债务已经付清了，因此，如果你要从他们那里得到任何惩罚，那就等于在收取两次付款。因此，神啊，你所有的圣洁，你所有的公义，不仅仅是你的怜悯，不仅仅是你的怜悯，不仅仅是你的爱，你所有的圣洁，你所有的公义，你本性的全部都要求你将他们视为美好。

每一个其他宗教，可能你们大多数去过教会的人，基督教会也相信同样的事情。每一个其他宗教都认为，当涉及到我与神的关系时，这有点像一个天平。你看那个天平，对吧？你知道，在旧法庭里，他们总是有一位蒙着眼的女士之类的。你知道，蒙着眼罩的天平。

每个人都怎么想呢？嗯，我有善行和恶行，如果我有更多的善行而不是恶行，如果我的善行超过我的恶行，那么神就会善待我。而基督教说，神的圣洁本身，神的公义本身，相比之下，世界上所有的山脉和世界上所有的行星都如同一粒尘埃，现在都站在你这边。这就是为什么约翰一书，如果你认为我在夸大其词，约翰一书第1章第8节说，我们若

认罪，他是信实的，是公义的，必要赦免我们的罪。这里并没有说他是信实和仁慈的。

当然他是仁慈的，但经文没有这样说。如果他不赦免，如果他不持续地接纳我们这些相信耶稣基督的人，他就是不公义的。这意味着他的整个本性现在都站在我们这一边。让我简单地说。什么力量能够把神的圣洁、公义、报应和对邪恶的愤怒——

什么力量能够把这一切都变成母亲的乳汁？在整个宇宙中，什么力量能够改变事物，使得神的每一分圣洁现在都要求他像母亲一样爱你？是十字架。有一首赞美诗这样唱："何等奇妙，何等奥秘，在这指定中闪耀，我违背律法的过犯归于他，而他所有的顺服归于我。"这就是福音。

放下你致命的行为，放在耶稣的脚前，站在他里面，唯独在他里面，荣耀地完全，看你是否看到他是谁，然后看到他所做的。你就可以开始按照你真正的身份而活，因为第16节的最后一部分说了一些很简单的话。它说什么？他说，你的墙垣常在我眼前。嗯，等一下。

等一下。等一下。墙垣不是破损了吗？不，没有。在神的眼中没有。神说，我按照你将要成为的样子对待你。我对你的态度，不是基于你现在的样子，而是基于你将要成为的样子。这就是我们应该做的。换一种说法。简单地说就是这样。

我们也应该拿他为我们所做的说：看，如果这就是他看我的方式，那么我就必须这样看我自己。你必须应用这一点，它将起到任何作用。当你受苦时，你应该说什么？你为什么离弃我？等一下。

等一下。第14节中使用的"离弃"这个词，也在诗篇21章1节中使用。这正是耶稣在十字架上呼喊的同一个词。耶稣基督在说，你没有被离弃。我被离弃了。

我被离弃，所以即使当你被扔进坑里，你呼喊说，请不要把我卖为奴隶，神也永远、永远不会忘记你。他永远不会忘记你，因为他忘记了我。你必须

永远不要表现得好像祂曾这样做过。这意味着，无论你正在遭受什么，你都要说，这不可能是惩罚。这不可能是惩罚。

这一切都已落入耶稣的心中。不可能是惩罚。当你感到内疚时，你必须说，这不能把我带入定罪。当你感到失望，当你感到沮丧时，沮丧和被遗弃的感觉总是来自于此。沮丧和被遗弃意味着，对不起。

我知道这会很生动，但这就是经文的内容。当神说，你们要向我寻求某些只有我能给你们的东西。你的灵魂需要一种乳汁。那就是永恒的爱。母亲的爱不可能是永恒的。

即使是伟大的母亲也会死去。而且大多数母亲都不是完美的。无论你，如果你感到沮丧并说，我被遗弃了，我被遗弃了，那是因为有某样东西你把它当作了你的母亲而不是我。有某样东西你说，如果我拥有这个，那么我就美好了。你只有在我里面才是美好的。

这就是为什么祂说，如果你从某种意义上看到这一点，无论你的处境如何，无论是内疚，无论是缺乏自制力，无论是受苦，无论是什么，你都要应用这一点。应用这一点。这是我灵魂的健康。我能坦诚吗？这是我灵魂的健康。

不仅仅是一般意义上，我为耶稣而活，不仅仅是一般意义上。当我跌倒时祂原谅我，而是神属性的每一根纤维都是为我的。因此，星辰会从天上坠落，但祂对我的爱不能改变。基于这一点，我有可以站立的根基。任何其他的根基都是流沙，都是沼泽，而这可能是更健康的灵魂。

这是最后一件事。我过去确实有一所房子，里面有婴儿。我只是记得这个。唯一安静的时候，我的天哪，好安静啊。我突然意识到为什么。

因为他们在吃奶。我的意思是，那是他们唯一安静的时候，因为他们吃奶时无法哭泣。你的灵魂有多安静？这就是神所说的。如果你的灵魂不安静，如果它不安，如果它一团糟，你就不知道认识祂是谁是什么样的，不知道看到祂所做的是什么样的，也不知道操练

你现在在祂里面是谁。

因为当你掌握了这一点，你终于得到了奶。你的灵魂终于安静了。让我们祷告。我们的父，我们求你向我们显明这一点，就是耶稣如何被公义所毁灭，以至于现在公义站在我们这一边，你对我们的爱是不可摧毁的。请你向我们显明这是如何实现的？

请你向我们显明我们如何能够应用这一点？父啊，这是一剂强效药。对我们许多人来说，这是最难抓住的东西。我们试图抓住它，却发现我们必须一遍又一遍地将它打入我们的头脑中，而我们如此迅速地失去了方向。主啊，今晚，求你用你的恩典将这些真理比以往任何时候都更深地刻在我们心中，使我们能够开始实践我们是谁，真正看到你所做的一切。

我们奉耶稣的名祷告。阿们。
