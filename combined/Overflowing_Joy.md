# Overflowing Joy / Overflowing Joy

## Chinese Translation / 中文翻译 / English Transcript

Welcome to Gospel in Life. During January, we're inviting our listeners to consider becoming a Gospel in Life monthly partner. If you'd like to learn more, keep listening at the end of today's podcast for details.

Do you ever wish life came with an owner's manual, a guide to follow when you're facing difficult decisions or just trying to live with integrity in the small everyday moments? Today on Gospel in Life, Tim Keller shows us how the Ten Commandments help us align our lives with God's will, not by restricting us with outdated rules, but by laying the foundation from which we can live a life of true freedom and flourishing. And now, brothers, we want you to know about the grace that God has given to the Macedonian churches.

Out of the most severe trial, their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity, for I testify that they gave as much as they were able, and even beyond their ability, entirely on their own, they urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the saints. And they did not do as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us in keeping with God's will. So we urge Titus, since he had earlier made a beginning, to bring also to completion this act of grace on your part.

But just as you excel in everything, in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in your love for us, see that you excel in this grace of giving. I am not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others. For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that through his poverty you might become rich.

We're returning to a series that we gave up about a month ago for Christmassy themes, and that's a series on the Ten Commandments. The Ten Commandments, we're saying, are like high steel. You know, the high girders that have to be thrust up into the sky so that a skyscraper can be built on it?

In the same way, the Ten Commandments are high steel. The Ten Commandments are not confining chains, chains that confine our human potentiality, nor are the Ten Commandments busy work from some cosmic algebra teacher who's trying to keep us off the streets. Rather, the Ten Commandments are high steel, a framework on which to build a life of greatness.

Money, this shouldn't come to a surprise in this city, money is really just a measure of your power. Money is power. The more money you have, the more choices you have.

The more of the world you control, the more choices you have, the more power you have. That's all money is. It's a measure of how much of the world you control.

Money was designed to be our dignity. There's no human dignity without money. Money answers to something God put down deep in us, and that is we all need to have part of the world to care for.

And without any part of the world to care for, we have no dignity. So money is supposed to be our dignity, but what has happened in most of our lives because of sin and the effects of sin on us, money has not, instead of being our dignity, money has become our definition. And that's different.

And what that does then is that turns money into a destructive power in your life. The three principles that Paul talks about are these. Number one, God owns everything that you've got.

Number two, Jesus impoverished himself for you. And number three, you can take it with you. God owns everything you've got, so you've got to act like a trustee.

Jesus gave everything for you, so you're free for radical generosity. And you can take it with you if you invest it in eternal things. There's two kinds of thievery.

The first kind of thievery is when we refuse to honor the caretaker rights of other human beings. The second kind of stealing is you've got to honor the owner's rights over your own wealth or you're stealing. In Malachi chapter 3, God says, will you rob me?

How can you rob God? You rob me in tithes and offerings. Robert Murray McShane was a Scottish minister who preached in Scotland over 150 years ago, and he said: "Oh, my dear friends, if you would be like Christ, and you pray that you will be, become like him in giving.

Though he was rich, yet for our sakes he became poor. Objection, someone says. My money is my own.

Answer. Well, Christ might have said, my blood is my own, my life is my own, and then where would you be? My dear Christians, if you want to be like Christ, give much, give often, give freely, even to the vile, even to the undeserving.

Christ is glorious and happy, and so shall you be. It's not your money I want. It's your happiness.

Remember his own word. It's more blessed.

欢迎收听《生命中的福音》。在一月份，我们邀请听众考虑成为《生命中的福音》的月度支持者。如果您想了解更多详情，请在今天的播客结束时继续收听。您是否曾希望生活能有一份使用手册，一份指南，在面对艰难抉择或只是努力以正直的态度度过日常生活的小时刻时可以遵循？

今天在《生命中的福音》，提摩太·基勒（Tim Keller）向我们展示了十诫如何帮助我们使自己的生活与上帝的旨意相一致。不是通过用过时的规定限制我们，而是为我们奠定一个可以从其中自由和繁荣生活的基础。现在，弟兄们，请允许我们告诉您上帝赐给马其顿教会的恩典。在最严酷的考验中，他们溢出的喜乐和极端的贫穷激发出丰富的慷慨，因为我要作见证，他们所捐的是他们所能捐的，并且多捐了，是出于自己甘心乐意的心。

他们迫切地恳求我们，要与圣徒同享这服事的机会。他们的行为并没有像我们所期望的那样，而是首先将自己献给主，然后才献给我们，完全顺从上帝的心意。你们在一切上既然这样清洁、有见识、有知识、殷勤、满有爱心，并对我们的爱多有实行，就要在此上也显出丰盛的恩赐。我不是勉强你们，乃是试验你们爱心的真实，看你们是出于热心而甘心行这美事；你们若照我们先前所吩咐的乐意行了，就必因此大得勉励。

因为你们知道主的心肠，他虽然富足，却为你们成了贫穷，叫你们因他的贫穷可以成为富足。我们正在回归一个月前因圣诞节主题而暂停的一系列讲座——关于十诫的主题。十诫就像是高层建筑中的高钢梁，你知道的，那些必须向上延伸到天空中去，以便在上面建造摩天大楼的高钢梁？在同一方式下，十诫是高钢。

十诫不是束缚我们的锁链，限制我们的人类潜能；也不是来自某个宇宙代数老师布置的无聊作业，试图让我们远离街头。相反，十诫是高钢，是我们构建伟大生活的框架。金钱，在这座城市里，这不应该让人感到惊讶，金钱实际上只是衡量你权力的标准。金钱就是权力。

你拥有的钱越多，你的选择就越多。你控制的世界范围越广，你的选择越多，你的权力越大。这就是金钱的全部意义。它衡量的是你掌控了多少世界。

金钱是我们的尊严。没有金钱就没有人类尊严。金钱回应了上帝在我们内心深处放置的东西——我们都需要拥有这个世界的一部分来照顾。如果没有这个世界的一部分可以照顾，我们就不会有尊严。

所以，金钱本应是我们尊严的表现，但由于罪恶和罪恶对我们的影响，在大多数人的生活中，金钱并没有成为尊严的象征，反而成了定义我们的标准。这就不同了。这使得金钱在你的生命中变成了一种破坏性的力量。保罗提到的三个原则是：第一，上帝拥有你的一切；第二，耶稣为你舍弃了一切；第三，你可以带走它（指财富）。

上帝拥有你的一切，所以你应该像信托人一样行事。耶稣为你舍弃了一切，所以你可以自由地慷慨解囊。如果你将财富投资于永恒的事物中，你就可以带走它。有两种偷窃的方式。

第一种是拒绝尊重其他人的看护权利；第二种是你必须尊重对你自己的财富拥有者的权利，否则就是偷窃。在玛拉基书第三章，上帝说：“你们岂是抢夺我吗？” 如何强夺神的？你们在奉献上亏缺了神。

苏格兰牧师罗伯特·麦唐纳150多年前布道时说过：“亲爱的朋友们，如果你们想成为像基督的人，并且你们祷告要达到这个目标，就要向他学习慷慨施舍。虽然他是富有的，但为我们的缘故，他成了贫穷的。有人会说：我的钱是我的。回答是：那么基督可能会说，他的血是他自己的，他的生命是他自己的，那你们又在哪里呢？

亲爱的基督徒们，如果你们想成为像基督的人，就要多给、常给、慷慨地给，甚至给那些不配的人，甚至是恶人。基督是荣耀和快乐的，你们也会如此。我不是要你们的钱。我要的是你们的幸福。

记得他自己的话：‘更多有福。
