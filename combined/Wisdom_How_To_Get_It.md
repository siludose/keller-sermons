# 智慧：如何获得 / Wisdom How To Get It

**讲员**: 提摩太·凯勒 (Tim Keller)

Welcome to the Gospel Unliked Podcast. Many of the questions we face in life are complex and aren't always answered by simply following rules. Do I speak up now or do I wait?

Should I take that job or say where I am? That's why wisdom is so crucial. But how do we develop it?

Today join us as Tim Keller explores how we apply God's wisdom to the everyday complexities of our lives.

Love, let love and faithfulness never leave you, bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart. Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and man. Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding in all your ways submit to him and he will make your path straight.

Not be wise in your own eyes, fear the Lord and shun evil. This will bring health to your body and nourishment to your bones. My son, do not despise the Lord's discipline and do not resent his rebuke because the Lord's discipline, because the Lord disciplines those he loves.

As a father, the son, he delights in, this is God's word. So we're going to short series on the early chapters of the book of Proverbs. We're just doing three weeks here right after Labor Day and Proverbs is about wisdom.

We live in a culture in which there's more choices than there ever have been and we also live in a city in which there's an enormous number of choices. What you need in order to make good choices is wisdom. This, of course, moral values, moral goodness is important.

On the other hand, wisdom is knowing what the right thing is to do in the 80% of life situations that the moral rules don't directly apply to. So for example, you might have two careers to take and both of them are morally acceptable. One of them fits you and one of them doesn't and if you make the wrong choice, you could waste an enormous amount of your own time in a lot of other people's time too.

If you make a bad choice because you're out of touch with reality, out of touch with reality of what the job really entails, out of touch with reality with who you really are, it's a huge difficulty and you could take years to get your life back on track even though you're morally good, even though you're a good person, right? Even though there was nothing wrong morally in what the decision you made, but you can be incredibly moral, incredibly good, incredibly knowledgeable, and still make pretty stupid choices. So question, what is wisdom, we looked at this last week in chapter one of Proverbs, wisdom is competence with regard to the realities of life.

Competence with regard to the realities of life, how life really works, well how do you get wisdom? That's what we're here for tonight because here in chapter three is very well-known chapter. We learn where wisdom develops, the vehicle through which wisdom develops, and the catalyst that sparks them all and fuels them all.

So there's a place where wisdom occurs, where you learn it, there's vehicles through which you learn it, and then there's a catalyst for those vehicles. Let's take a look at that. First of all, brief but important is where does wisdom actually happen?

It doesn't happen in a classroom, it doesn't happen in a seminar, I could give you a seminar with the Bible says about wisdom, but I would just be telling what I'm about to tell you now, and that is you can't get wise in a seminar, where does it happen? There's a metaphor all through the book of Proverbs, actually all through the Bible, but all through the book of Proverbs. You see it in verse six, it says, do this, do this, do this, and he will make your path straight.

No, that's not that hard to understand as a metaphor, what does that mean? God will make your path straight, that means he'll make your life go well. Your life is being likened to a pathway, and therefore living your life is being likened to walking a path.

Now, that metaphor says a lot. First of all, think about this, walking a path means doing something very, very steadily, something very simple. If you jump, if you summer salt, even if you run, you won't get very far because everybody can walk a lot farther you can run.

Even the greatest athletes can still walk further than they can run. The best way for you to make progress on the path is to do something very simple, very rhythmic, called walking one foot after another foot, in front of another foot, and if you walk on the path, it takes you somewhere you don't stay where you were. Why is this a metaphor for life?

Here's what it means. So actions you take repeatedly, day after day, in your ordinary daily life make you something. You can't stay the same.

The way in which you behave, the actions, the choices you make in just ordinary daily life is turning you into something. It's actually take turning you into a wise person or a foolish person, you know why? Because it's character that is forged in the small parts of daily life.

Nobody brings this out better than C. S. Lewis.

C. S. Lewis says that every day when you make little decisions, you are putting a little mark on your soul, a little twist on your soul.

And slowly he says, it's through the little things you do, it's the pathway. It's just one foot after another foot after another foot. The actions and choices you're making in your very ordinary daily life is either taking you down to becoming a person like the angels or like the demons.

So he gives an example in his book, Merry Christianity, in the chapter on forgiveness. Here's what he says. He says, imagine something.

Imagine one day you read in the newspaper a story. And it's about a party of people that you don't like. And the story is, oh there's going to be a big scandal that's about to break.

These people have acted very, very badly, very scandalously and it's going to be a big scandal and they're going to be thrown out of power. And you don't like them anyway. So what you do is you're reading this newspaper story and you're enjoying this.

You say, hey, I never liked these people's positions, I didn't like their politics and so now it turns out that they're really nasty people. They're going to be turned out of office, that's great. Then Lewis says, what if a week later you read another story in the newspaper that says, hey, that wasn't right.

It turns out that the original report was not true or not so bad as it was made out. And Lewis says at that point, you've got a choice to make. You may not even realize it.

He says, on the one hand, you could say this. You could say, oh, thank goodness that person is not as bad as I thought he was. Or you can be very disappointed.

And this is what he says. He says, you can either decide, well, I guess I was wrong. The person is really a pretty good person.

Or you can be disappointed. I wanted to think that person was that bad. Now here's what he says.

This is Lewis. He says, he says, if you go with the first feeling, then thankfully he's not so bad. That's one thing.

But if you go with the second feeling, and he says the second feeling is a feeling of disappointment, and the determination to hold on to the first story for the sheer pleasure of thinking your enemy is bad as you would like them to be. He says, if you do that, I am afraid it's the first step in a process which, if followed to the end, will make you into a devil. You see, one is beginning to wish that black was just a little blacker than it really is.

And if we give that wish its head, later on, we shall wish to see gray as black, and eventually you'll be able to see white as black, and finally, you'll be fixed forever in a universe of pure hatred. Because remember, we Christians believe the soul lives forever. And so what really matters is a little Marx or twist on the central inside part of the soul which are going to turn it in the long run into a heavenly or hellish creature.

Do you hear what he's saying? He says, when you don't like somebody, and then you hear that they're really, really bad. Then you find out they're not so bad, and you say, I'm, and you basically, but I want to think that they're that bad.

So I'm going to believe that they're that bad. What have you done? Because of your resentment, because of your grumpiness and unhappiness, you are choosing to believe something that's probably not true.

You want to believe that. And that means you're just a little more foolish than you were a minute ago. Because you're out of touch with reality.

Think of these, think of three character qualities. There's humility or pride. There's cowardice, I mean, there's a part of it should say courage or cowardice.

There's grace and forgiveness or there's anger. Now, if you're angry and you're resentful, you want to believe a person is bad, even if they're not. So what you're going to do is if you see something that confirms your prejudice, your belief, you're going to grab to that.

And if you see something that shows the person's not as bad as you think they are, you're going to ignore it. And what do you, you're out of touch with reality. You're creating a scenario in your mind of what the person is like that isn't true.

And you're going to make bad choices because wisdom is competence with regard to the realities of life. Wisdom is making choices on the basis of reality, not what you think is real, but what is real. If you're a coward or if you're proud and you don't take anybody else's advice, you want to think your opinion and your feelings are the right ones, don't you see?

Here's the first point. It's the little things you do every day that can either make you more resentful, more cowardly, more proud, or more loving, more forgiving, more courageous. And the greater the, the stronger your character, the wiser you're going to be because the more in touch with reality you are, do you get this point?

In other words, in daily life, your little choices turn you, give you good character and that good character is the basis for making the big choices wisely. Little choices give you the character on the basis of which you make the big choices wisely because life is a path. And it's an ordinary daily life that wisdom is lost or gained bit by bit by bit, one foot after another foot, another foot, extremely gradually.

Point two, all right, how can you set things up so that you are making those good choices and you're moving down that path toward wisdom instead of foolishness. There's four things that the text tells us about. Four things that if you do, we'll enable you to make the choices in daily life that develop the character, of humility and of courage and of graciousness and so on.

It's the small choices that create the character on the basis of which you make the wise big choices because you're in touch with reality. How do you get that character? If in daily life you do four things, and here's what they are, I'll list them and then go through them.

Knowing God, this is how wisdom comes through knowing God, trusting God, submitting to His Word and living in community. First of all, knowing God. Look at verse three, but love and faithfulness never leave you.

Bind them around your neck and write them on the tablet of your heart. Now, this is not an easy text to understand immediately because when we read it in English, it looks like it's saying be a loving, faithful person, right, but love and faithfulness never leave you. That's not exactly, you probably think be a loving and faithful person, but look at the way it's talking about.

What do you mean love and faithfulness never leave you, bind it around your neck, write it on the tablet of your heart, don't let go of it, don't lose a grip on it. What does that mean? And actually the word for love here and faithfulness are two Hebrew words that are words that actually describe God's covenant love for His people.

The word love there, by the way, is the Hebrew word case says, which actually means His unconditional love for His people, His commitment, His faithfulness, His graciousness, that He's unconditionally committed to you. So when it says, let God's love and faithfulness never leave you, hold them on, bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart, talk about it all the time. Here's what it's saying.

You need to be absolutely convinced of and never lose your grasp of His unconditional gracious love for you or put it like this. You need to know, know, know in your heart of heart of hearts that He's for you, that He would do anything for you, that He has done anything for you, that He's unconditionally committed to you. Why, why does that create wisdom to think about that?

If you really had that deep, if you knew, knew, knew, your heart of heart of hearts, love and faithfulness, His unconditional love, it would give you a poise that you would never panic. You'd always make wise choices because you just would never be panicked, you'd never be running scared. Well, how do you do that?

Binding them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart? Actually, there's a lot of things I'm sure you can do. But mainly, the very least it means having a prayer life.

At the very least it means taking an abstract idea, making it real to your heart to prayer, at least daily, maybe a couple of times a day, through, you have to at least have a very vigorous life in which you are walking with God that you're praying and reading and talking to Him that you're practicing His presence and reminding yourself of what He's done for you. So, first of all, knowing God, daily knowing God, enables you to make the choices that will turn you, push you toward wisdom and not foolishness. Secondly, though, look at this, verse 5, trust in the Lord with all your heart.

Now, I'm afraid when you hear that right away, you just start to feel inspired. Trust in the Lord with all your heart. It sounds like a hallmark reading card and, you know, oh, how nice.

But it actually has got an edge to it. It really has teeth to it. Because it is very possible to believe in God, to obey God, I mean, other to obey the think commandments, to pray to God and not trust, give the functional trust of your heart to something else.

It's possible to believe in God, but to trust something else for your real significance, for your real security. So for example, you believe in God, you go to church, you obey the think commandments, you pray, but is your career? The real functional trust of your heart.

Is that really the way you get yourself a steam? You really get your sense of value and worth. Is it what you really, really get your sense that I'm safe in this world?

Come on, be honest. Very often, you won't admit it until something goes wrong with it. But when something goes wrong with it, here's the problem.

Anything you make, the functional trust of your heart, whether it's your beauty, your intelligence, your talent, your career, your wealth, family, some romantic relationship, your spouse, anything you make, your functional trust, there is always anordinate emotions around those things. That is to say, if something goes wrong with your career, you're going to be sad. It's awful.

It's terrible. But if it's your trust, you will be devastated, you will be emotionally debilitated, you won't be able to function. There's these enormous emotions around things that are your functional trust rather than God.

And it clouds your judgment. It makes you unable to actually be wise. So knowing God, trusting God, okay, thirdly, and lean not on your own understanding in all your ways submit to Him.

Now, I said thirdly, the way for you to develop wisdom is through submitting to God's word. Now, it doesn't say Bible there, it doesn't say scripture, it doesn't say that at all. And yet it says that even though you may have this opinion, you may have this belief, you may have this understanding of things, you need to follow God's understanding and submit to Him and His will, not your own.

Now, how does that happen? The background of the whole book of Proverbs is the Torah, the law of God. In fact, most commentators on the book of Proverbs say, Proverbs is nothing but the law of God, the Torah, being applied to daily life.

And so, it's immersing yourself in the Word of God, that's the way, instead of leaning on your understanding, instead of doing your own will, you lean on His understanding. Now, how does immersing yourself in the Bible, just plunging yourself in, learning it, mastering it, listening to it, reading it, studying it? How does that turn you actually into somebody who's wise?

There's a nice simple way and there's a more complex way, okay? Now, here's the simple way. There are a lot of just plain rules in the Bible, moral categories, categorical moral statements.

So, for example, what if you're married, and marriage isn't going very well, and you have an opportunity for an extramarital fair, an actual offer is on the table from someone, and you're wrestling, do I want to do that? I don't, can I handle that? You know, what should I do this?

You know, and you're wrestling, we'll see another Bible can really help you with this decision. Now, here you are wrestling, you're taking all this time, maybe you're working through decision making matrices and things like that, and the Bible says, no, no, never, you're married, you made a promise, while you're married, no. So, it's very simple, I know, there's plenty, the Bible says, you don't have to pray about it.

You don't have to sit around, you don't have to think it out, you don't, and there's a lot of things the Bible says. As I said, you know, 20, 25% of your life decisions, the Bible's got some nice, clear, you know, tracks to run on, and so in some ways, you know, you might, now listen, we don't always like what the Bible says, so here you are in this marriage, but I don't understand, lean not on your own understanding. Say, maybe you don't like it, or maybe you find it difficult to understand, but there it is, and so how do you let God's understanding trump yours?

How do you do that? So that you become wiser as time goes on, then you would be otherwise, it's one way is through submitting to the Word of God. That's the simple way, but there's a more complex way, I do need to tell you about this.

The more complex way is important. Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer? Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith?

For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding of what it means to follow Christ. A great resource to start using this summer is the new city catechism devotional, God's truth for our hearts and minds. This devotional brings the historic catechisms of the Christian Church to life, offering a question to consider for each week of the year.

In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catechises, the rich and communal practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers that frame the foundational beliefs of the Christian faith. Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer, and a brief meditation that will challenge and inspire you. The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller, and Kevin D.

Young, as well as historical figures such as Augustine, John Calvin, and Martin Luther. This month, in addition to the new city catechism devotional, we're including a great companion resource, the new city catechism for kids, as our thank you for your gift to help gospel and life share the hope of Christ's love with people all over the world. So, request your copies today at gospelonlife.com slash give.

That's gospelonlife.com slash give. Now, here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. Alistair McIntyre in his book, After Virtue, and he's a, Alistair McIntyre is a Catholic philosopher, wrote a book called After Virtue.

And in the book, he gives an illustration. It's very famous. It's rightly so.

And the illustration goes like this. Imagine that you're standing at a bus stop and a young man you've never met in your life. You don't know him.

A young man walks up to you and says, Hey, the Latin name of the common wild duck is histrionicus, histrionicus, histrionicus, and then he walks away. Okay, so. All right.

How do you make sense of that? Why did that happen? It happened.

How do you make sense of that? Now, McIntyre's point is there's only one way to make sense of it. And that is you have to put it in a narrative.

You have to, you have to say, what is the story in which this incident makes sense? And it can't make any sense unless you stick it into a story. Now, he says, there's three, he suggests three possible stories.

There's probably more. He says, the first story is actually very likely in a pretty sad story and a sad story is that the man is mentally ill or mentally deranged or traumatized or something so that there's some that he's mentally not right. It's a very sad story and he, well, that would make sense.

It would not and of course it would make sense of it and it would be sympathy for him. And so that's one story that would make sense of it. He says, here's a second story and that is it's mistaken identity.

That maybe several days ago when he was in the library, he was trying to look this book up and find it about the Commonwealth Duck and he talked to the librarian and you look like the librarian. And so, you know, they was dark in there and now he's out here at the bus stop. And he thinks you're the librarian so he walks up because you look like that person somewhat and says, hey, you know what, I did find the book.

Okay, that's a little bit less likely but it's possible. Now he says, here's the third story by the way that McIntyre says, well, their story is this man is a spy and he is mistaken you for his contact and he's giving you the code. Now that's not as likely but well, it could be.

Now here's McIntyre's point, what happened makes no sense unless you stick it into a narrative and the narrative you put it in completely determines how you respond to it. Now, yeah, obviously you're going to respond in very different ways depending on whether the person's, you know, a mental patient, you know, or any of that sort of thing or a spy. Now let's think about something.

Think of your money, the money you have. How do you look at it? How do you treat it?

How do you act toward it? What do you do with it? Do you realize it all depends on what you think the story of the world is?

If you accept the secular idea that we're here by accident, when we die, we just rot. Eventually, when the sun dies, there'll be nobody around to remember anything that anyone's ever done. In that situation, then all you have, the only happiness you'll ever have is the happiness you can have right here, right here.

So how are you going to treat your money? You'll treat it one way. But what if the story of the world is very different?

What if we were all created by God so that absolutely everything that we have is a gift from him? And what if the world is fallen, but God has come into redeeming it and someday he's going to renew it and there's going to be an afterlife? What if this life is not the only life?

What if this life is actually a relatively small part of your entire life? Your entire life on earth is only a small part of your entire existence. Now in that story, not only your money looks different, obviously everything looks different.

It all depends on what story you put it in. And when people come to me and say things like, how much money, as a Christian, how much money should I give away? So God is pleased because I really don't want to give one cent more way than I need to.

So what you're doing is you're looking for a rule like thou shalt not commit adultery. You're saying thou must give 12.3 percent of your income away to the poor. So you're looking for a rule.

But what if the Bible gives us a story that's so different than the world's story that it's going to make you generous? It's going to make you far, far, far more generous. See, when you then read not just the rules of the Bible, but the narratives and the history and everything, everything in the Bible, as you read it and you immerse yourself in it, every part of your life looks different.

And therefore, how you live is different and the wisdom grows out of that. And it's not as simple as what's the rule about how much I have to give away. The more you immerse yourself in the word of God, the more you become wise.

You see that? Because everything looks different in the story that the Bible tells us about the world. And there's one more thing that one more vehicle that you need in order to develop wisdom and daily life.

And that is community. It says here in verse 7, do not be wise in your own eyes. Do not be wise in your own eyes.

Now, the definition of a fool is a person who's wise in his or her own eyes. The definition of a fool is someone who only cares to see things from their own perspective. Now, I'm in this room and I can see some things from this perspective that none of the rest of you can because I have this unique perspective.

But many of you can see things around you that I can't see very well because I'm old. And you're far away and you're closer. And therefore, to really know what's happening in this room would take all of our perspectives.

Is that not right? Now, the definition of a fool is someone who only sees things from his or her own eyes. I don't care what anybody else thinks.

I see it the way I see it. The definition of wisdom is to see things through as many other eyes as possible. Through God's eyes, through the word of God, through your friend's eyes.

Because you have friends and you have other people. The definition of wisdom in the book of Proverbs is a person who's created a company of counselors around them over the years. Mentors and counselors and friends and people that you always check with.

We are an individualistic society. We are a place where we're taught, you make your own decision, you make your own call. You shouldn't be accountable to other people.

You shouldn't have to have you shouldn't let other people weigh in on what is your life. Yeah, it's your life. Yes, but you can't see it.

You can't see it. You can't see yourself. Do you know what you really look like?

You don't know. Every time you look at a mirror, you're looking at something else. You're not really looking at yourself.

It's the reason why so often when you actually see a picture of yourself, you say, oh, or, or if you actually listen to recording of yourself, you say, who is that awful person? I don't sound like that, do I? Because you don't.

You're inside here and you hear yourself through the bones in years or something like that. When you actually hear your voice, you sound off. You say, I don't sound like that.

Do I? And all your friends say, yes, that's you. See, their eyes see better.

And only if you are deeply involved in community, are you going to be wise, and in the Word, and in trusting God, and in knowing God. But not done, not quite. Because actually, in this text we're told, there's a catalyst, a kind of spark that makes all the vehicles run turbocharged.

There is something that when it happens it makes all these things produce wisdom at 10 times the normal rate. Do you know what that is? Well, it's kind of a shock when we get to it.

It says here in verse 11 and 12, my son do not despise the Lord's discipline and do not resent his rebuke because the Lord disciplines those he loves as a father, the son he delights in. Now, the image isn't hard to see. It's talking about a father disciplining a son.

Well, what is the father who's disciplining a son do? The father brings into the son's life painful things, things that are hard, things that are difficult, things that are painful, things that make the child cry usually. What is that doing here?

Okay, look, here's what's so surprising about this. Look at verses 1 and 2. Do this in this peace and prosperity.

Look at 3 and 4. Do this in this favor in a good name is the result. Okay, look at 5 and 6.

Do this in this straight pass. That's the result. And then 7 and 8.

Do this in this health for your body, nourishment to your bones. So if you do this and you do this right, if you do this right, you do this right, you do this right, you do this right, you do this right. Oh, by the way, even if you do everything right, horrible things are going to happen to you.

That's what it's saying. It's completely unexpected. You're going right along and suddenly, hey, bad things are going to happen to you.

And God's going to let them happen to you. Now, how do we respond? What does this mean?

Well, at the most basic level, it is very basic wisdom. You know why? At the most basic level, this chapter at least is saying that you can do everything right and your life still go pretty bad.

Everything right and your life still go pretty badly. You can do this right and this right be moral, be decent, you know, be charitable, be work hard, submit to God, do all these things and still terrible things happen. And I want you to know that at the, at the most basic level, if you don't believe that, if you don't know that, you are not ready for life.

You are actually foolish because you're not in touch with reality. The reality is people who do live extremely good lives and have very smart and pretty much everything right. You can still have terrible lives.

Now, I'll tell you, I see a lot of young people who don't want to believe that. When they see somebody's life blow up, they actually say they probably did something wrong. I'm not going to do that.

That's very self-justifying. That's being wise in your own eyes. And that's setting you up for incredible disappointment because if you believe that people whose lives blow up have always done something wrong in order for that to happen, you don't know how life works.

You are not wise. You are not competent with regard to the realities of life. So the very least is telling you, you can do everything right in your life, still blow up.

But it's also telling you something else. This is a chapter on how to become wise. These are things that have to happen in order for you to become wise.

And what this is saying is, nobody ever gets wise without really bad things happening to them. Now, it's not just Christians who believe this. I mean, I do know that our modern Western society does not see anything like this in suffering.

It's just seen as a total disaster. But almost every other culture and every other religion has always understood this. And that is that if you don't suffer, you will not be wise.

You'll be a shallow person. People who live charm lives, people who've had almost everything go well, are shallow people. And virtually everybody who is wise says, I learned the most through my failures, my mistakes, through bad things that happened to me.

Look, do you want to really know yourself? Do you really want to know who you are, your strengths and weaknesses? That only happens if you're tested.

Do you want to be good at helping hurting people, skillful and compassionate and helping hurting people? That's only going to happen if you've been through it. Otherwise, you won't know what to do.

You'll be clueless. You'll actually make things worse when you try to help. Do you want to be absolutely so sure that you can trust God that he's there for you?

So absolutely sure that nothing really rattles you. I think that only happens. Frankly, you don't really learn to trust God until you're drowning.

You don't really come to see that Jesus is all you need until Jesus is all you have. But when you realize this and you say, okay, suffering, turbocharges everything else, it's not until you suffer that you really end up knowing God in prayer, that you really end up trusting God instead of the things that you used to trust, which have now blown up on you. It's only through suffering that you really get into the Word of God.

And then you really get into community. We are often just go off on our own. We're our own person and we really don't rely on other people until what happens.

What happens is suffering comes and then it comes and suddenly we need people, which is we always did. In other words, suffering, turbocharges all the other things that move you toward wisdom. But I think everybody does know that suffering doesn't necessarily do that.

Because as I said, the thing you need to be wise and make good choices is character. You need to become humble, not proud. You need to become courageous, not cowardly.

You need to become gracious and forgiving, not angry and resentful. But the problem is suffering can make you a proud person. Haven't you seen that?

Some sufferers become very arrogant because they feel like you don't understand how I've suffered. They feel noble. They feel better than other people.

Suffering can also, of course, make you a coward. Say, you're so broken that they just won't face anything. Suffering can make you incredibly bitter.

In other words, when suffering happens, it will be either pushing you down the path toward wisdom, toward greater humility and greater dependence on God and greater, or it'll be pushing you toward foolishness. Why? What is the key?

How, listen, suffering is inevitable and it's either going to make you wiser or stupider. So how are you going to make sure it makes you wiser? Here's the key.

The key is you have to believe that God delights in you when it happens because the Lord disciplines those He loves as a father's son. He delights it. In real child discipline, if a father really loves his son, and he's letting bad things come into the child's life as part of discipline, he's not doing it to condemn the child.

He's not doing to hurt the child. It hurts him to see the child cry, but he's doing it to grow the child up. You have to be absolutely sure that he loves you and delights in you when the bad things happen or the suffering will harden you.

It'll make you despondent. It'll make you turn from God. It'll make you turn away from life.

It'll make you arrogant. You've got to believe that he delights in you if you're going to have suffering soften you and make you wise rather than harden you and make you foolish. But how can you be sure?

How can anybody be sure? In the New Testament, these two verses, 11 and 12 are picked up and put down in Hebrews chapter 12. There it says, my son, do not make a light of the Lord's discipline.

Don't lose heart when he rebukes you. The Lord disciplines those he loves and he punishes everyone he delights in as a son. But right near it is this.

Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfect of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, scorned its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. And there it is. Think how can you be sure that you're a child of God that he delights in when you're going through suffering?

That's what you need. Otherwise you won't become a wise person. How can you be sure if you see what Jesus did for you?

You see, when Jesus Christ was baptized, the Spirit came down on him, and there was a voice from heaven that said, this is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased in whom I delight. But when he got to the cross, all through his life, whenever Jesus turned to God, he always said, father, when his disciples said, how should we praise a our father? When he's in the garden of the assembly, he says, father, always father, whenever he talks to God, except on the cross, when he cries out, my God, my God.

Why doesn't he call him father there? Because Jesus at that point is being expelled. He's being rejected.

He's getting what we deserved so that when we believe in him, our sins can be forgiven. He took the potential we deserve so that we believe in him, our sins are forgiven. And it says in John chapter 1, 12, for those who received him, who believed on his name, he gave authority to become children of God, were adopted, were brought in.

That is losing his sonship so we can become children of God. He's losing that so that it says in Romans chapter 8 verse 16, the Spirit bears witness with our spirit that we're children of God. What does that mean?

It means because Jesus died on the cross and took our punishment. We can know now that he is pleased with us. And sometimes the Spirit comes in and says, you are my beloved child in him.

I'm well pleased. That will re-narrate your world. That will re-narrate it.

That story you put anything in that. And it'll turn to gold. See, how can you know, no, no, in your heart of heart, of hearts that he loves you only because he went to the cross?

How can I trust God in suffering if he's never suffered? But he has. We're the only religion on the face of the earth that says God is suffered.

And if he suffered, he suffered like that, then I can trust him in the suffering. I can know he delights in me. Otherwise, he wouldn't have gone to the cross.

And therefore, when you rest in Jesus and see what he did for you, you are going to find that your troubles relate to your heart the way fire relates to gold or the way pressure relates to diamond. It'll just make you into something great. Let us pray.

Our Father, we want to become wise. No, we want to become like Jesus in whom all the treasures of knowledge and wisdom are hid. And therefore, we pray that you would help us to look to what Jesus did on the cross for us.

And therefore, seeing that proof that you delighted us, go through the ups and downs of life, knowing you, trusting in you, submitting to your word, and living with our Christian brothers and sisters, and getting in the community, and becoming more and more conformed to the image of your Son and his name we pray. Amen. Thanks for listening to today's teaching.

欢迎收听《福音不受待见播客》。生活中我们面临许多复杂的问题，而不仅仅是遵循规则就能解决的。现在说还是等一等？接受那份工作还是保持沉默？

去还是不去？这就是为什么智慧如此重要。但我们如何培养这种智慧呢？今天，让我们一起聆听提摩太·凯勒（Tim Keller）如何探讨将上帝的智慧应用到我们日常生活中的复杂问题上。

在收听今天的教导时，请登录 gospelunlife.com 并订阅电子邮件更新。订阅后，您将收到我们的季度期刊和其他宝贵的以福音为中心的资源。今天请订阅 gospelunlife.com。以下经文来自箴言书第3章1-8节和11-12节：“我儿，你不可轻看耶和华的管教，也不可厌烦他的责备；因为耶和华所爱的，他必责备，正如父亲责备所喜爱的儿子。

” 我的儿子，你要紧记我的教训，将我的命令藏在心里。这样，你存活的日子就会增多，得享平安与繁荣。要存爱心，不可忘记爱心和忠信，要将它们系在你的颈项上，写在你心版上。如此，你必蒙人尊重，在上帝和世人面前有美好的名声。

你要专心倚靠耶和华，不要倚靠自己的聪明；在你一切所行的事上都要认定他，他必指引你的路径。不可自以为聪明，要敬畏耶和华，远离邪恶。这样，你身体就得健康，骨头就得滋润。我的儿子，不可轻忽耶和华的管教，也不可厌烦他的责备，因为耶和华管教那些他所爱的人。

正如父亲喜悦儿子一样，这是上帝的话语。因此，我们将在接下来的几周内探讨《箴言》书的早期章节。在劳动节后的三周里，我们将一起学习智慧的重要性。我们的文化中充满了前所未有的选择，而我们生活在一个拥有无数选择的城市中。

为了做出明智的选择，你需要的是智慧。当然，道德价值观和道德美德也很重要。另一方面，智慧是在道德规范不直接适用的80%生活情境中知道该做什么。比如，你有两个职业可以选择，这两个职业都是道德上可以接受的。

其中一个适合你，另一个不适合你。如果你做出了错误的选择，不仅会浪费自己大量的时间，还会浪费很多其他人的宝贵时间。如果因为脱离现实而做出错误选择——不了解工作的真实情况，不了解真实的自我，这将是一个巨大的挑战。即使你是道德上正确的人，甚至是一个好人，即便你的决定在道德上没有问题，但你仍然可以做出非常愚蠢的选择。

因此，什么是智慧？我们上周在箴言第一章中探讨了这一点，智慧是对生活现实的胜任力。对生活的现实有胜任力，即了解生活如何运作，那要如何获得智慧呢？今晚我们就来探讨这个问题，因为在这里，在第三章有一个非常著名的章节。

我们将学习智慧是如何发展的，智慧通过哪些途径发展，以及激发并推动这一切的动力是什么。首先，我们来看看智慧在哪里发生？它不是在教室里发生的，也不是在研讨会中发生的。我可以给你讲一堂关于圣经中的智慧的课，但那只是告诉你们我现在要告诉你们的内容——你不能从研讨会上获得智慧。

那么，它发生在哪儿呢？整本《箴言》乃至整个圣经中都有一个隐喻，但在《箴言》中尤为明显。在第六节可以看到：“这样，你的道路就光明，你的脚踪就没有障碍。” > ```markdown 不，这并不是很难理解为一个比喻。

那是什么意思呢？神会使你的道路平坦，**这意味着他会让你的生活变得顺利。**你的人生被比作一条路，因此生活就是行走在这条路上。这个比喻蕴含了很多意义。

首先，想想看，走路意味着做一件非常稳定、非常简单的事情。如果你跳跃、蹦跳甚至奔跑，你也不会走得很远，因为每个人都能走得更远。即使是最好的运动员，他们也能走得更远，而不是跑得更远。你最能取得进步的方式就是做一些非常简单、有节奏的事情，比如一步一步地走。

只要你走在路上，它就会带你去一个不同的地方，而不会让你停留在原地。为什么这个比喻适用于生活呢？这是因为，你每天重复采取的行动使你成为某个人。你不可能保持不变。

你在日常生活中所表现的方式、所做的选择实际上是在塑造你。这实际上是把你塑造成一个明智的人或愚蠢的人。你知道为什么吗？因为你的性格是在日常生活的小细节中锻造出来的。

没有人比C.S.刘易斯更清楚地表达这一点了。C.S.刘易斯说，每天当你做出小决定时，你都在给自己的灵魂打上一个小印记，在灵魂上做一个小小的扭曲。他慢慢地说，正是通过你在日常生活中所做的小事，这条道路才得以形成。它就是一步一步地走，一步接一步地走。

你在非常普通日常生活中的行动和选择要么把你引向成为像天使一样的人，要么把你引向成为像恶魔一样的人。他在《快乐的基督教》一书的“宽恕”章节中举了一个例子。他说，想象一下： 想象有一天你读到报纸上的一则消息。这则消息是关于一群你不喜欢的人的聚会，并且说即将发生一个大丑闻。

``` 这些人行为极其恶劣，非常令人震惊，这将是一场大丑闻，他们会被赶下台。而且你们本来就对他们没什么好感。所以你读着报纸上的报道，乐在其中。你会说：“我从没喜欢过他们的立场，也不认同他们的政治观点，现在发现他们是些恶人，被赶出政坛真是太好了。

”然后路易斯说：“但一周后，你又看到另一则新闻报道，说原来那不是真的。” 事实证明最初的报道并不准确或没有那么糟糕。路易斯说这时你得做选择。你甚至可能根本没意识到这一点。

他说：一方面，你可以这么说：“哦，谢天谢地，那个人并没有我想象的那么坏。”或者你会非常失望。这就是他所说的。他说，你可以决定，好吧，看来我是错的了，这个人其实是个不错的人。

或者你会感到失望，希望那个人比你想象的还要糟糕。然后他说： 这是路易斯的话。他说：“如果你选择第一种感觉，那真是太好了，至少这个人没有那么坏。”这是第一个结果。

但如果你选择第二种感觉——他所说的第二种感觉是失望和坚持保留最初的故事，仅仅为了享受认为敌人比你想像中更坏的乐趣——他说：“如果那样做，我恐怕这只是成为恶魔的第一步。你看，你开始希望黑色再黑一点。” 如果我们让这个愿望成真，以后我们会希望灰色也变得漆黑一片，最终你会看到白色也是黑色的，最后，你将永远固定在一个充满仇恨的世界里。因为记住，我们基督徒相信灵魂永生。

所以真正重要的是，灵魂深处的一点扭曲会最终将其变成天堂或地狱般的存在。你听见他在说什么吗？他说，当你不喜欢某个人，然后听说他们真的很坏。后来发现其实他们并不那么坏，你说，我本来是这么想的，但我想他们就是那么坏。

所以我要相信他们真的那么坏。你做了什么？因为你的怨恨、因为你的情绪低落和不开心，你选择了相信一个可能并不真实的事情。你想相信这个，这就意味着你比刚才更愚蠢了一点。

因为你脱离了现实。想想这些，想想三种品格特质：谦卑或骄傲。有胆怯的一面，或者说勇气或胆怯。有恩典和宽恕，或者愤怒。

如果你生气、心怀怨恨，你会选择相信一个人是坏的，即使他们不是那么坏。所以你看到能证实你的偏见、信念的事情时，你会抓住不放。而当你看到这个人其实没有你想得那么坏的时候，你会视而不见。这就意味着你脱离了现实。

你在心里构建了一个关于这个人的场景，并且这个场景并不真实。你会做出错误的选择，因为智慧是对生活现实的正确应对能力。智慧是基于事实来做选择，而不是你认为的事实。如果你胆怯或者骄傲，不听别人的建议，你想让你的观点和感受是对的，不是吗？

第一个要点就是：你每天所做的小事，可以让你更加怨恨、胆怯、骄傲，也可以让你更加仁慈、宽恕、勇敢。你的品格越强大，你就越明智，因为你更接近现实。你明白这个点了吗？换句话说，在日常生活中，你的每一个小选择都会塑造你，赋予你良好的品格，而这种良好品格是你做出明智大决策的基础。

这些小选择让你在现实面前保持清醒，从而能够做出明智的大决策，因为生活就像一条道路。智慧是在平凡的日常生活中一点一滴积累起来的，一步一个脚印地前进，极其缓慢。第二点，那么如何设置环境，使你能够做出那些正确的选择，并沿着通向智慧的道路前行而不是愚蠢的道路呢？经文告诉我们四件事。

如果你做到这四件事，就能在日常生活中做出培养谦逊、勇气和仁慈等品格的选择。正是这些小选择塑造了你的品格基础，让你能够做出明智的大决策，因为你与现实保持联系。那么如何获得这种品格呢？如果在日常生活中你做四件事情，下面就是它们： 认识上帝。

智慧是通过认识上帝、信任上帝、顺服祂的话语并在群体中生活而来的。首先，认识上帝。请看第三节经文：但爱和忠诚永远不会离开你。将它们系在你的颈项上，在你心版上写明。

这并不是一个容易立即理解的文本，因为我们用英文读时，它看起来像是在说要做一个有爱心、忠诚的人，对吧？但是“爱和忠诚永远不会离开你”并不完全如此。你可能认为要成为一个有爱心、忠诚的人，但看看它是如何描述的。这句话是什么意思呢？

实际上，“爱”这个词在这里和“忠诚”是两个希伯来词，它们描述的是上帝对他子民的盟约之爱。顺便说一句，那个“爱”的词，其实是希伯来文的“chesed”，正如查尔斯所说的，这个词实际上指的是祂对你子民的那种无条件之爱、承诺、忠诚信实以及恩慈。也就是说，祂无条件地向你承诺了这一切。所以当经文说，“让神的爱和忠诚永不离开你，紧握它们，将它们系在你的颈项上，在你心版上写下它们，常常谈论它们。

”这就是它所表达的意思。你需要对你心中那份无条件的恩慈之爱深信不疑，并且永远不要失去对它的把握。或者说，你需要知道、知道、知道你的心中——从心底最深处——祂是为你着想的，祂会为你做任何事，祂已经为你做了很多事，祂对你无条件地承诺了这一切。为什么思考这一点会让你变得明智？

如果你真的有这种深刻的认识，如果你心中深深地知道、知道、知道祂的爱和忠诚，祂对你的无条件之爱，这会给你一种从容不迫的态度，让你永远不会惊慌失措。你总是能做出明智的选择，因为你永远不会感到恐慌，也不会四处逃窜。那么，你怎么做到这一点呢？将它们系在你的颈项上，在你心版上写下它们？

实际上，你可以做很多事情。但最重要的是，至少要有祈祷的生活。至少要做到将一个抽象的概念转化为对你心灵的实际祈祷，每天至少一次，甚至可能一天几次。你需要有与神同行的积极生活，不断地祷告、阅读和与祂交谈，实践祂的同在，并提醒自己祂为你所做的一切。

首先，认识神、每日认识神，使你能够做出那些会引导你走向智慧而非愚昧的选择。其次，看看这节经文，第5节说：“全心倚靠耶和华。” 我担心当你听到“全心倚靠耶和华”时，你会立刻感到振奋。听起来就像是贺卡上的读物，“哦，多美好。

” 但它其实有锋芒，真的有力量。因为有可能相信上帝、顺从上帝——也就是说，遵守十诫、祷告，却不真正信任祂，把你内心的实际信任寄托在其他事物上。你可以相信上帝，但**真正的实际信任却放在了别的地方。比如，你相信上帝，去教会，遵守十诫，祷告，但是**你的事业、你的真正价值和安全感，是不是你内心真正的依靠？

这真的是让你感到满足、找到自我价值和意义的方式吗？真的能给你带来安全感吗？来吧，诚实一点。很多时候，直到出了问题你才承认这一点。

但当出现问题时，这才是问题所在。无论你把什么当作内心的真正信任——美貌、智慧、才华、事业、财富、家庭、一段浪漫关系、你的配偶等，都会伴随着巨大的情绪波动。也就是说，如果事业出问题了，你会感到悲伤；这很糟糕。但如果那是你真正的信任，你会感到彻底的绝望，情感上无法承受，无法正常生活。

这些是你内心真正信任的事物所带来的巨大情绪波动，而不是上帝。这会蒙蔽你的判断力，让你无法明智地行事。所以，认识上帝、相信上帝，第三点，不要倚靠自己的理解，在一切事上都顺服祂。我说的是第三点，你获得智慧的方式是通过顺从神的话语。

这里并没有提到圣经或经文，但它说即使你有这种看法、信仰和理解，也需要跟随上帝的理解并顺从祂的旨意，而不是你的意愿。现在，这一切是如何发生的呢？整本《箴言》的背景是摩西律法，即上帝的律法。事实上，大多数注释家都认为，《箴言》就是上帝的律法——摩西律法在日常生活中应用的结果。

因此，浸润神的话语才是正道，而不是依靠自己的理解，不是按照自己的意愿行事，而是依靠祂的理解。那么，如何通过浸润圣经来让自己变得明智呢？只是沉浸在其中，学习它，掌握它，聆听它，阅读它，研究它，这一切是如何让你成为有智慧的人的？这里有一个简单的方法和一个更复杂的方法，明白了吗？

现在，让我们来看这个简单的方法。《圣经》中有许多简单的规则，道德分类，明确的道德陈述。例如，如果你已婚，婚姻状况不佳，而你有机会出轨，实际有人向你提出邀请，你正在挣扎：我是否应该这么做？我能处理吗？

你知道，你应该怎么做？这时，《圣经》可以帮你做出决定。你正犹豫不决，可能在花时间思考决策矩阵等问题时，《圣经》却说：“不，绝对不可以，你是已婚的，你做出了承诺，在婚姻期间绝不可以。”所以，这很简单，《圣经》已经明确告诉你了，你不需要为此祈祷。

你不必坐下来深思熟虑，也不必纠结于细节。《圣经》中有许多事情是如此明确的，就像我说的，20%到25%的生活决策，《圣经》为你提供了清晰的道路可走。因此，在某些方面，你可能会想：听着，我们并不总是喜欢《圣经》的说法，但你在婚姻中遇到这种情况时，要依靠神的理解胜过自己的理解。也许你不认同它，或者难以理解，但这就是事实。

那么，你是如何让神的理解超越你的呢？你怎么做到的呢？这样随着时间的推移，你变得越来越智慧，而不是其他方式，其中一种就是通过顺服神的话语。这是简单的方式，但还有一种更复杂的方式，我需要告诉你。

更复杂的方式很重要。这个夏天你在寻找增长信仰的方法吗？还是希望帮助新信徒或孩子们理解基督教的核心？对于很多人来说，夏季可以提供更多的机会来深化自己的信仰和对跟随基督意义的理解。

今年夏天开始使用的一个很好的资源是“城市信条”灵修书，《神的心智与我们的思想》。这本灵修书将基督教历史上经典的信条带入生活，为一年中的每一周都提供了值得思考的问题。在引言中，提摩太·凯勒阐述了为什么需要信条，这是一种丰富而集体的学习和记忆问答的方式，这些问答构成了基督教信仰的基础信念。每周包括一段经文、一篇祷告和简短的默想，这将挑战并激励你。

附带的注释由当代牧者如约翰·派博、提摩太·凯勒和凯文·德等撰写，以及历史人物如奥古斯丁、加尔文和路德。无论是年轻人还是历史人物，“城市信条”灵修书和“城市儿童信条”都是我们感谢您捐赠给福音与生命的礼物的一部分。这两本资源将帮助分享基督之爱的信息给世界各地的人们。所以，今天就去 gospelonlife.com/give 预约您的副本吧。

gospelonlife.com/give 现在，提摩太·凯勒将继续今天的教导。亚历斯·麦金泰尔在他的书中《美德之后》中写道，亚历斯·麦金泰尔是一位天主教哲学家，在这本书中他提供了一个著名的例子。这个例子是这样的：想象你站在一个公交站牌前，遇到了一个你从未见过的年轻人。你们之间没有任何关系。

一个年轻人走到你面前，说：“嘿，普通野鸭的拉丁学名是 histrionicus, histrionicus, histrionicus，”然后就走了。好吧，就是这样。你怎么理解这件事？为什么会发生这样的事？

它确实发生了。你怎么理解这件事？现在麦克金特的观点是，只有通过一个故事才能理解这件事。也就是说，你必须把这个事件放在一个故事中去理解。

你必须问自己，这个事件在什么故事里才有意义？否则它就没有任何意义。他说，他提出了三种可能的故事。当然，还可能有更多。

他说，第一个故事其实非常可能是这样一个悲伤的故事：这个人精神失常或受到创伤，所以他的精神状态有问题。这是一个很悲伤的故事，而且这能解释一切，也能让人同情他。这是第一个能解释这件事的故事。他说，第二个故事是误认身份。

也许几天前他在图书馆里查这本书《共济会鸭》，和图书管理员交谈过，你看起来像那个图书管理员。现在他站在公交站，天色较暗，所以他可能以为你是图书管理员，就走过来对你说：“嘿，你知道吗？我找到了那本书。” 这虽然不太可能，但还是有可能的。

他说，第三个故事是麦克金特提到的：这个人是个间谍，他把你误认为他的联系人，并给你传达了代码。这当然不太可能，但也有可能。现在麦克金特的观点是，这件事没有意义，除非把它放在一个故事中去理解，而你选择的故事完全决定了你的反应方式。当然，显然你会根据那个人是否精神失常、图书管理员还是间谍等情况做出非常不同的反应。

那么让我们想一想。思考一下你手中的钱，你是如何看待它的？又是如何对待它的？你会怎么使用它？

你是否意识到这一切都取决于你觉得世界的故事是什么样的？如果你接受世俗的观点，认为我们只是偶然存在，在我们死后，一切都将消逝。最终当太阳死亡时，没有人会记得任何人的所作所为。在这种情况下，你拥有的唯一快乐就是眼前的快乐。

那么你会怎么对待你的钱呢？你会这样看待它。但如果世界的故事完全不同呢？如果我们都是上帝创造的，那么我们所拥有的一切都是他赐予我们的礼物。

如果这个世界已经堕落，但上帝正在将其赎回，并且有一天他会重新造就这个世界，还会有来世。如果这生命不是唯一的生命呢？如果这生命实际上只是你整个生命中很小的一部分，你的地球生活只是你整个存在的一小部分。在这种情况下，不仅金钱看起来不同，一切都会有所不同。

这一切都取决于你如何讲述这个故事。当人们来找我，问作为基督徒应该捐出多少钱时，他们说上帝会高兴的，因为我真的不想多给一分钱。实际上，他们在寻找一种像“不可奸淫”的规则。但圣经给了我们一个如此不同的故事，以至于它会让你慷慨大方，让你变得极其慷慨。

当你阅读圣经不仅仅是其中的规则，还有叙述、历史和一切内容时，你会沉浸在其中，你会发现你生活的每一个部分都看起来不同。因此，你的生活方式不同了，智慧也由此生长。这不仅仅关乎我该捐出多少东西的规则。你越沉浸在神的话语中，就越会变得有智慧。

你看出来了吗？因为圣经向我们讲述的世界里，一切看起来都不同。还有一件事情，你需要一个额外的工具来在生活中发展智慧。那就是社区。

这里第7节说：“不可自以为聪明。”“不可自以为聪明。” 愚昧人的定义是：认为自己很聪明的人。愚昧人只关心从自己的角度看问题。

现在我在这间房子里，有些东西我能从这个角度看到，而你们其他人看不到，因为我有独特的视角。但你们中的一些人能看到我看不到的东西，因为你们年轻，距离不同。因此，真正了解这间房间里发生的事情需要我们所有人的视角。对吧？

愚昧人的定义是：只从自己的角度看问题的人。我不在乎别人怎么看。我认为它就是这样的。智慧的定义是从尽可能多的角度看待事物，通过神的眼睛、圣经的话语、朋友的眼睛来看待事物。

因为你有朋友和其他人。《箴言》中智慧的定义是一个人在多年里建立了一群顾问团队的人——导师、辅导员、朋友和你总是会咨询的人。我们是一个以自我为中心的社会，在这里我们被告知要自己做决定，自己做出判断。你不应该对其他人负责，也不应该让别人影响你的生活。

是的，这是你的生活。但你能看到它吗？你看不到你自己。你知道你真正是什么样子吗？

你不知道。每次你照镜子时，你看到的是别的东西，而不是**真正的自己。这也就是**为什么你经常会看到自己的照片时会说：“哦，这是谁？”或者听到自己录音的时候会问：“我怎么会是那样的人？

我不像这样。”因为你不是。你是从里面听的，通过骨头或某种方式听到自己的声音。当你真正听到自己的声音时，你会觉得不自然，会觉得“我不是这样的”。

对吧？而你的朋友们都说：“没错，就是你。”他们的眼睛看得更清楚。只有当你深深地参与到社区中，才会变得智慧，在圣经中找到真理，并且学会信任上帝、认识上帝。

但这还不够，因为在这段经文中我们被告知，有一种催化剂，一种火花，能让所有的车辆加速运行。有一种东西发生时，会让这一切以十倍的速度产生智慧。你知道是什么吗？当我们到那里时，这确实是一个令人震惊的发现。

这里提到，在箴言15章11和12节中说：“我的儿子，你不可轻看责备你的人，也不可厌烦训斥你的；因为谁爱他的儿女，就常管教他们。”这段话中的形象并不难理解。它在谈论父亲如何管教儿子。那么，一个管教儿子的父亲会做些什么呢？

他会让儿子经历痛苦的事，困难的事，艰难的事，通常会让这个孩子哭泣。这是在这里要表达的吗？好吧，让我们来看看这有多么令人惊讶。看看1和2节：“你当以乐意的心听从管教。

”“你当以智慧的话回答人。”3和4节：“你当在尊贵人面前自卑，在位上的人有敬畏心。”5和6节：“你当与聪明人同行，又愿存着正直的心行路。” 也就是说，如果你这样做，如果你这样去做，如果你这样去实践，即使你做对了一切，糟糕的事情仍然会发生。

这就是它要说的意思。这完全出乎意料。你一直顺利地前进，然后突然间，嘿，糟糕的事情就要发生了。神会让这些事情发生在你身上。

那我们该如何回应？**这意味着什么呢？最基础的层面，这其实是非常简单的智慧。**你知道为什么吗？

至少在这一章中，它告诉我们即使你把一切都做得对了，生活仍然可能会变得很糟糕。做得对，但生活依然会变得很糟糕。你可以做好这件事，做好那件事，道德、正直、慈善、努力工作、顺服神，做所有这些事情，但仍然会有可怕的事情发生。我想告诉你，在最基础的层面，如果你不相信这一点，如果你不知道这一点，你就不适合面对生活。

你其实很愚蠢，因为你没有接触现实。现实是，即使过着非常美好的生活，拥有很高的智商和几乎把一切都做得对的人，也可能会有糟糕的生活。我告诉你们，我见过很多不想相信这一点的年轻人。当他们看到某人的生活崩溃时，他们会说那可能是因为那个人做了错事。

我不打算那样做。这是自我辩解，是自以为明智。这会让你对未来充满巨大的失望，因为你认为那些生活崩溃的人总是因为做了什么错事才会这样。你不懂生活的运作方式。

你不够明智，也不够有能力应对生活的现实。所以最起码的一点告诉你，即使你把生活中的一切都做得对了，生活仍然可能会变得糟糕。但这还告诉了我们另一件事。这一章是关于如何变得明智的。

这些事情的发生是为了让你变得更聪明。而这里的意思是，没有人不经历一些非常糟糕的事情就变得明智。并不是只有基督徒相信这一点。我知道我们的现代西方社会并不认为苦难有任何价值，只视为一场灾难。

但几乎每一个其他文化和宗教都一直明白这一点：如果你没有经历过苦难，你不会变得明智。你会成为一个肤浅的人。那些过着迷人生活、几乎一切顺利的人，都是肤浅的人。而几乎所有有智慧的人都说：“我从失败中学到了最多，从我的错误中学会了，从发生在自己身上的坏事中领悟到的。

” 你真的想了解你自己吗？你想真正地知道你是谁，你的优点和缺点吗？那只有在经过考验之后才会发生。你想成为帮助受苦人的高手，具备同情心并且擅长帮助他们吗？

那只有经历过这些之后才能做到。否则，你就不会知道该怎么做。你会茫然无措。当你试图帮助别人时，反而会把事情弄得更糟。

你真的想如此确定地相信上帝，相信他会在你需要的时候出现吗？你真的想如此坚定，没有任何事能动摇你的信念吗？坦率地说，直到你快要溺水了，你才会真正学会信任上帝。直到耶稣成为你唯一依靠时，你才会真正认识到他是你所需要的。

但当你意识到这一点，并说“好吧，苦难让一切变得更加强烈”，只有经历了苦难之后，你才能真正通过祷告认识上帝，真正地依赖上帝而不是之前依赖的东西，这些东西现在都已经破灭了。只有经历苦难，你才能真正深入《圣经》。然后你会更加融入群体。我们常常独自行动，自认为是独立的人，直到发生了什么才会真正依赖他人。

换句话说，苦难让所有让你走向智慧的事情加速发展。但说实话，几乎每个人都知道，苦难不一定能做到这一点。因为正如我说的，你需要具备智慧并做出正确选择的是品格。你需要变得谦卑而不是骄傲。

你需要变得勇敢而不是懦弱。你需要变得宽宏大量和宽容而不是愤怒和怨恨。但是问题在于，苦难可能会让你变得骄傲。你没看到过吗？

一些受苦的人变得非常傲慢，因为他们觉得别人不懂他们的痛苦。他们觉得自己高尚，比别人更好。当然，受苦也可能让你变得懦弱。比如，你如此破碎以至于无法面对任何事情。

受苦可能会让你异常愤世嫉俗。换句话说，当苦难发生时，它要么把你推向智慧的道路，走向更大的谦卑和对神的更大依赖，要么把你推向愚蠢。为什么呢？关键是什么？

如何，听我说，苦难是不可避免的，它会让你变得更聪明或更愚昧。那么，你怎样才能确保它让你变得更聪明呢？这里的关键在于： **关键是你必须相信，在苦难发生时，神喜悦你。**正如主管教那些祂所爱的人，如同父亲管教儿子一样，祂是喜悦的。

在**真正的亲子教育中，如果一个父亲真的爱他的儿子，并且让一些不好的事情进入孩子的生活中作为管教的一部分，他并不是**为了谴责孩子。他也不是为了伤害孩子。看到孩子哭泣让他很痛苦，但他这样做是为了让孩子成长。你必须确信祂爱你，在苦难发生时喜悦你，否则苦难会令你变得冷淡、远离神和生活。

它会让你变得傲慢。你必须相信祂喜悦你，这样苦难才能软化你并让你变得更聪明而不是更硬心和愚蠢。但你怎么能确定呢？任何人都怎么能够确定呢？

在新约中，这两节经文（11和12）被引用并在希伯来书第十二章中提到。在那里说：“我的儿子，不要轻看主的管教。”“当祂责备你的时候，不要灰心；因为主所爱的，祂必管教，又鞭打凡所收纳的儿子。”但紧挨着的是这个： 让我们定睛在耶稣身上，他是我们信心的创始成终者。

他为了那摆在前面的喜乐，忍受了十字架的苦难，轻看了羞辱，如今坐在神宝座右边的位置上。而这就是事实。你怎样才能确定自己是神所喜悦的孩子呢？当你经历患难时？

你需要这样确信。否则你就不能成为一个明智的人。你怎样才能知道耶稣为你做了什么？你看，在耶稣受洗的时候，圣灵降在他身上，天上就有声音说：“这是我的爱子，我乐意与他同在。

”但当他到了十字架上，整一生中，每当耶稣转向神时，他总是称呼“父”。当门徒问到如何赞美他们的父亲时，他在聚会的花园里说，“父”，总是“父”，无论何时他对神说话，除了在十字架上，那时他喊道：“我的神，我的神。” 为什么在那里他不叫他“父”呢？因为在那一刻，耶稣正被驱逐，正遭到拒绝。

他承受了我们应得的惩罚，好让我们相信他时罪得以赦免。他承担了我们应得的后果，好让我们相信他时罪得以赦免。约翰一章12节说：“凡接待他的，就是信他名的人，他就赐他们权柄，作神的儿女。”也就是说，耶稣在十字架上受死并承担我们的惩罚后，我们可以知道他是喜悦我们的。

罗马书8章16节说：“圣灵与我们的心同证我们是神的儿女。”这又是什么意思呢？**这意味着因为耶稣在十字架上为我们受死，我们现在可以知道他喜悦我们。**有时圣灵会来见证，“你是我的爱子”，“我乐意与你同在”。

这将重新讲述你的故事。你会把任何东西放进这个故事里，它都会变成金子。那么，你怎么能确信，只有在你的心中，耶稣爱你是因为他去了十字架？如果神从未受过苦，我怎么能相信他在患难中信任他呢？

但他确实受过苦。我们是唯一宣称神也受过苦的宗教。### 讲道内容翻译 如果他受苦，就像那样受苦，那么我就可以信任他在受苦中与我同在。我知道他喜悦我。

否则，他就不会去十字架上。因此，当你依靠耶稣，并看到他为你所做的一切时，你会发现你的困难与你的心灵息息相关，就像火对金子的关系一样，或者压力对钻石的关系一样。这些困难会让你变得更加伟大。让我们祷告。

我们亲爱的天父，我们渴望变得聪明。不，我们更希望成为像耶稣那样的人，在耶稣身上隐藏了所有的智慧和知识。因此，求你帮助我们注视十字架上耶稣为我们所做的一切。既然有证据表明他喜悦我们，就让我们在生活的起伏中认识他、依靠他、顺服他的话语，并与我们的基督徒兄弟姐妹一起生活，在社区里成长，越来越像你的儿子和他的名字。
