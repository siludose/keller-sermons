# 圣灵是谁 / Who Is the Spirit

**讲员**: 提摩太·凯勒 (Tim Keller)

---

Welcome to Gospel and Life. Who is the Holy Spirit? And why is the Spirit's work so vital to the Christian life?

The Bible tells us the Holy Spirit is not just a vague force, but a person who works in the lives of Christians in profound ways. Today Tim Keller is exploring how the Spirit calls us to faith, unites us together, equips us with gifts and shapes us to be more like Christ. The Scripture reading this morning comes from John's Gospel, chapter 14, verses 16-26.

And I will ask the Father and He will give you another counselor to be with you forever, the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept Him because it neither sees Him nor knows Him, but you know Him for He lives with you and will be in you. I will not leave you as orphans, I will come to you.

Before long the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me because I live, you also will live. On that day you will realize that I am in my Father and you are in me and I am in you. Whoever has my commands and obeys them, He is the one who loves me.

He who loves me will be loved by my Father and I too will love Him and show myself to Him. Then Judas, not Judas Iscariot, said, but Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world? Jesus replied, If anyone loves me, He will obey my teaching.

My Father will love Him and we will come to Him and make our home with Him. He who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own, they belong to the Father who sent me.

All this I have spoken while still with you, but the counselor, the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you. This is the Word of the Lord. In the summertime, of course, because of vacations, there are multiple preachers up here and in order to keep ourselves unified and make sure that we are working together, we choose a common theme and what we are going to be doing from now all the way into the middle of September is looking at what the Bible teaches about the Holy Spirit, the doctrine of the Holy Spirit.

My impression is that there is an awful lot of churches in the world that talk about nothing but spiritual experience and there is an awful lot of churches that are just absolutely afraid of the subject and just want to talk about doctrine and truth and knowing the right things. But I think the remedy for that imbalance is the doctrine of the Holy Spirit because the deeper you get into it, the more you realize that spirit and truth go together and that's what we are going to be doing over the next number of weeks. This is an introduction, let's take a look at what this great passage tells us about who of the Holy Spirit is, what He does and then how you can receive what He gives.

Who He is, what He does, how you can receive what He gives, very top level, very basic intro, but wonderful. First, who is He? Who is the Holy Spirit and by the way, I already gave you a bit of an answer by the choice of my pronoun.

The Holy Spirit is a personal, is the personal divine resident of the Christian's heart. The Holy Spirit is the personal divine resident of the Christian's heart. First of all, personal.

Have you noticed that Jesus refers to the Holy Spirit, not as it, as we tend to do, not as an energy or as a force, but as He, you see, like, you know, right away, right in where He says, the world cannot accept Him, He, a person, in Ephesians 430, the Holy Spirit is said to be grieved. You can grieve the Holy Spirit. In Hebrews 10, 29, it says you can outrage the Holy Spirit in Romans 15, it says, the Holy Spirit loves, so He loves, He's grieved, He's outraged, an impersonal force cannot feel all those feelings, that's a person.

But He's not only a person, He's God. So for example, right up here, it says, and I will ask the Father and He will give you another counselor, we'll get to the word counselor in a minute. But Jesus says, He's another counselor, I'm a counselor, He's another one.

Now there's two ways, there's two Greek words that could be used to talk about another. There's this one, and then there's another one. The one Greek word for another is hetero, which means actually a posed or different to the former.

The other Greek word that could be used is alos, which means just like the former. Now you've got to realize what Jesus is saying here, because Jesus made some enormous claims about Himself. Jesus said, there's a place in John 8 where He says, before Abraham was, I am.

He takes the divine name that God gave to Moses and the burning bush. Jesus says, it's me, I am. Before Abraham was, I am.

Jesus claims to forgive all sins. You know what that means? When He says, I can forgive all sins, that means all sins are against me, because you can only forgive the sins that are against you.

Jesus says He's going to judge the world. So Jesus is constantly saying, I am equal to God. And now He has the audacity to come along and say, I'm sending you someone who's just like me.

The Holy Spirit is a person, the Holy Spirit is God, and what we are into right now is the dizzying doctrine of the Trinity. Can I make you a little dizzy with it? In verse two, which we didn't read, in verse two of this chapter, Jesus is all about saying, I'm going away.

I'm going away, okay? Then here it says, in verse 16, He says, but the Holy Spirit is coming. And then you go down into verse 21, He says, my father, and I will love you.

And in verse 21, 22, and 23, He says, we will come to you. So He says, I'm going away, the Holy Spirit is coming, and therefore I'm coming. And Jesus is not saying, oh, I'm not really going away, I'm coming to you in the form of the Holy Spirit.

Or on the other hand, as He's saying, oh, I'm going away, and therefore I'm not coming, He's coming. He is so one with the Holy Spirit that when the Holy Spirit comes into your life, Jesus comes. And yet He is not so identical to the Holy Spirit that He isn't also already away, and therefore in heaven.

Got that? Okay? See how easy that was?

No, you know, here's, Jesus is saying, there's not three gods, because there are two one to be three gods. On the other hand, it's not one person in three forms. You know, there he has his father, half, and he has his son, half, and he has this Holy Spirit hat.

It's not three gods, there are two one for that, but it's not one god in three forms, there are two three for that. It's one god in three persons. And we're going to, in the next year, we're going to get back to this doctrine.

All I can tell you is, in the early days of my Christian faith, it was a millstone around my neck. It felt like this is so confusing, and today I think it's one of the greatest things. It's one of the joys I've got when I contemplated it.

Once you get to understand it, you see the beauty of it, and I can't go into any further than that, because we're here not to talk about the Trinity, but the Holy Spirit. But here's what I want you to see, why so important. The Holy Spirit is not an impersonal force.

The Holy Spirit is a divine person in the middle of your life. Why does that matter? Oh, it matters.

Because the Bible talks about being filled with the Holy Spirit. Later on, we'll have a whole sermon on that, being filled with the Holy Spirit. But being filled with the Holy Spirit is to experience incredible divine joy and power.

I want that, and I want that for you. So how do you get filled with the Spirit? If you are filled with the Spirit and you think of the Spirit as an impersonal force, you're going to go about seeking that in a different way than if you understand, you're being filled with the Spirit and the Spirit is a person.

If you try to get filled with an impersonal force, you go about it in a mechanical way. So for example, Eastern thought conceived God, the divine, as an impersonal force. Eastern thought sees the divine as an impersonal force.

And therefore, it's approach to, Eastern thought's approach, is meditation. But the meditation is always emptying the mind of thought, rational thought, emptying the mind of words. You emptied the mind of it.

Why? Because we're trying to get in touch with the force. And whatever you get into the Bible and you see the word meditation comes up a lot.

But Christian meditation, biblical meditation, is not emptying the mind of rational thoughts and words. Feeling the mind with the words of God is a completely different approach. If you don't, if you think of the Holy Spirit as an it, you're going to be moving in a mechanical approach.

In fact, I really do see an awful lot of Christian teaching on being filled with the Spirit that does sort of see the Spirit as a kind of electrical charge. And therefore, the way you get filled with the Spirit is by pushing buttons. You pray in certain ways, you do certain things, you refrain from certain things, you repent for certain things, and you kind of, you push all the right buttons and you get your life into some kind of environmental condition.

And then in it comes, it, no, no. If the Spirit is a person, then to be filled with a Spirit is like being filled with a person. How does that work?

Well, I know, for example, that when I was young, sometimes my parents would, if there was a visitor that came into our home for a while, a weekend or something like that. It was a person that my parents really respected. It could have been a visiting, dignitary, visiting speaker, or a member of the family that they had high regard for.

It affected everything. First of all, for some reason the house looked beautiful. Suddenly we made our living space just physically look beautiful.

But then secondly, everybody was on their best behavior, and it wasn't a sham. The point is the little things that used to just rub us the wrong way just didn't matter, because this person was here. And we hung on this person's words to be filled with a Spirit is to have your life transformed by an acute consciousness of the glorious person that lives permanently within the walls of your life.

I've told you this before, I remember once counseling a man who had had an affair and blew up his life, and he had been cheating on his wife. But he told me that whenever he would bring, if his wife was a wife, he would bring his mistress into the home. He had a turnover all the pay, and I tell you this recently, any picture of his wife, any picture of himself and his wife or any picture of his wife, he had a take down or turnover.

Because neither he nor the mistress could bear even the photograph face of his wife. Because even the presence of the picture would affect his behavior. Do you know who's living in your life?

Are you melted by spiritual understanding, by an acute consciousness of the glorious person that's there to change the way in which you live? Just the awareness of it fills you with a sense of his presence, and it would bring integrity to your life. You're doing right now that you wouldn't do if you were aware of him being there.

If you turn the pictures back over and you say, oh, I might think about this. Of course, it also means to hang on his words. Be filled with the Spirit is very different than to be filled with a force, which leads us to the second point.

The Holy Spirit is a personal divine resident of the Christian heart. Secondly, what does the Holy Spirit do? There are two words here that tell us what he does and they're great.

He is a Spirit of Truth, verse 17, and he is a counselor. He's a Spirit of Truth and a counselor. So first, he is the Spirit of Truth.

What does this mean? At one level, we know this, that the Holy Spirit essentially authored the Bible. The Holy Spirit literally is the author of the Bible.

So for example, in 2 Peter 1, it says this, no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet's own interpretation. For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit. And then here, this is John 6, verse 63, where Jesus says, the words I speak to you are spirit and life.

In other words, the words of Jesus that you see in the Bible were produced by the Spirit and if you embrace them and receive them and understand them, they give you eternal life. So the Holy Spirit, at one level, is the author of the Scripture. In fact, and see, this goes back to this idea of what it means to be filled with the Spirit if the Spirit's a person as opposed to a force.

If you go to Ephesians 5.18, the famous passage in which Paul says, be filled with the Spirit and then he makes a list of the traits of a Spirit-filled life which we won't go into right now. We have a sermon coming up on that later. Be filled with the Spirit, Ephesians 5.18, and then there's a list.

If you go to another one of his letters, Colossians, and if you go to chapter 3, and Paul wrote these letters to different churches, but he often said similar things because he was writing to churches and he got the same basic truths across. If you go to Colossians 3.16, it says, be filled with the Word. It says, be filled with the Word.

And then it makes a list of the Word-filled life. He says, let the Word dwell richly in you, which is the same as be filled with the Word. Then it gives a list of traits, and they're the same traits.

This Paul said in Ephesians 5.18, where the traits of a Spirit-filled life, you know what this means? See, to be filled with a person, to be dominated by a person, is to hang on that person's every word. It means to be dominated and saturated by the Scripture.

To let it dwell in your richly is not the same thing as knowing it as information, so take it in. It's to make it part of yourself, or another way to put it is this. You can look at glasses, but that's really not why I spent so much money on these.

I did not go to the optician and spend hundreds of dollars on this, just so I could sit them down and say, hey honey, come look at my glasses, that doesn't work that way. You put them on and you look at everything else through them. And the Scripture, it's one thing to look at the Scripture, and to say, I'm going to learn the facts.

It's another thing to let it dwell in your richly. It's another thing to be saturated by it. It's another thing to so take it in that you look at everything else through it.

And therefore, to be filled with the Word and to be filled with the Spirit is the same thing because he's a spirit of truth. In fact, he goes on beyond that, though. We already referred to it here, looking verse 21, whoever has my commands, that's the word, and obeys them.

He is the one who loves me. He who loves me will be loved by my Father and I too will love him, and I will show myself to him. Now that's interesting.

What does this mean? Here are some people who obviously believe in Jesus, and who obviously are obeying Jesus and they're reading the Word of God, and Jesus says, I will come and show myself to them. This is in this passage on the Holy Spirit, I will come and show myself to them.

Now, what does that mean? Does they not know who he is? Of course they know who he is.

What is that? What is the Holy Spirit taking the words and making them life, taking the words and making them power? Here's another place where Paul talks about it, and listen, this is actually one of the most important verses in the Bible to me personally.

This is Ephesians 3, Paul says, I pray, he's praying for his friends. He says, I pray that out of his glorious riches he will strengthen you with power through his spirit in your inner being so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you being rooted and established in love may have power to grasp how wide, and long, and high, and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.

He's talking to Christians, and he says, by the power of the Spirit, I'm praying that through the power of the Spirit Christ may dwell in your hearts, but Christ is already dwell in their hearts. They wouldn't be Christians. And then he says, I'm praying that by the power of the Spirit, you may grasp.

You may have power to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ. Don't they already know about the love of Christ? Of course they wouldn't be Christians.

He says, but I want you to know this love that surpasses knowledge. What's he talking about? Let me just give you an example.

John Kineber's Quiet Time Notebook is a little journal, he wrote. He says, I have, at many times, had the greatest delight in the Holy Scriptures of any book whatsoever. Oftentimes in reading, it every word seems to touch my heart.

I seem often to see so much light exhibited by every sentence and have such a refreshing, ravishing, food communicated from these words that I cannot get along in my reading. I'm often used to dwell long on one sentence to see the wonders contained in it. The sense I had of divine things as I read the Scripture would often of a sudden, as it were kindle of a sweet burning in my heart, an order of my soul that I know not how to express.

Though he's not doing too bad a job right there. What's he talking about? It's one thing to read the Scripture.

It's another thing to have the Holy Spirit come and reveal Jesus Christ to you in it. It's one thing to know, Christ dwells in your heart, it's another thing to sense it. We talked about this actually last week.

It's one thing to know with your head that sugar is sweet, it's another thing to taste it and have your whole being electrified by it. You not only know it, but you sense it, and that's the job of the Holy Spirit. He is the author, not only of objective truth, because he wrote the Bible, but of subjective truth, he makes it live in your life.

He makes it live, he makes it vivid and powerful, he makes it life-changing, and that's the first thing the Holy Spirit does. But believe it or not, that's not all. Because actually, if this is all he did, he still would be a kind of consultant, or somebody who hired just to come in and give you certain things at certain times.

But that's not all he is. He's also a counselor. I mean, this is the main point of this whole passage.

I will ask the Father and He will give you another counselor. Now, if you go to five or six translations, get out all your different translations, you're going to have five or six different words. And whenever you see English translations with very different words and every translation, that means that the word that's used here is too rich for one English word to convey and so the translators are struggling.

Some of you may have the Old King James Bible, and there's a number of other translations that say, and I will ask the Father and He will give you another comforter. Now, that's a really sweet word, but it does make the Holy Spirit sound like a quilt. So they don't use that much anymore.

But even this word, counselor, is this a camp counselor? Is this a marriage counselor? No.

Actually, they do know one thing, and this is the reason why we don't have a good word to come out with it. Basically, what the commentators know, this word is, this is the word paracaleo, or paracleic, paracleesis. It's actually a very difficult word to translate.

Parameans not to be in front or behind, but to stand alongside. Kaleo means to declare, to call, to argue, actually. And therefore, the best way to translate this is I'm going to send you another legal advocate.

The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God. Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365-day devotional, the songs of Jesus, you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight.

If you don't have a regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start. And if you already spend time and study in prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest emotions and questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with Him. We'll send you Tim and Kathy Keller's devotional as our thanks for your gift to help Gospel and Life share the love of Jesus with more people.

Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash give. That's gospelandlife.com slash give. Now here's Dr.

Keller with the rest of today's teaching. The word gets across the idea, but on the one hand, this person is yours. This person stands in your position, represents you.

This person is loyal to you to the end. This is a person who is for you in the strongest sense. But on the other hand, it also means this is a person who argues.

This is a person who debates. This is a person who makes a case. This is a person who defends you against your enemies.

There's a soft side that's the sympathy with you and there's a hard side. Now why in the world would Jesus Christ say that the Holy Spirit is your legal advocate? What does that mean?

And here's what I believe it means. The Holy Spirit's job is to defend you against the enemies here on earth, but especially the enemies inside your own heart. For example, in Romans 8, 15, it says, God has not given us a spirit of fear, but he's given us the spirit of his son who comes into a heart-crying oba father.

You know what that means? Your heart's filled with fears, fears. And the Holy Spirit comes in and argues and says, no, God loves you.

You're a his child. Then one verse later, Romans 8, 16, it says, the Spirit bears witness with our spirit that we're children of God. We actually talked about this last week, what I didn't bring out is the word bears witness is a technical Greek word that means the star witness in court.

A person bringing testimony, legal testimony in court that basically settles the case. And so what this is saying is, your heart's filled with doubts. Your heart's filled with doubts.

And in comes the Holy Spirit and says, no, there's no reason to doubt. You are his. You are loved.

Or there's this great spot in Hebrews 12, which is all about suffering and all the troubles that come to us. And in Hebrews 12, it says, have you forgotten the word of exhortation that argues with you? That's what the Greek word means as children.

My son do not make light of the Lord's discipline for he disciplines those he loves. The Hebrews writer is quoting Proverbs 3 and he's saying that the job of the Holy Scripture is to argue with you when you're cast down. Suffering has happened to you.

Bad things have happened to you. And you feel like, oh, I'm being abandoned. No, according to the book of Hebrews, he says, the Scripture argues with you.

How? As children, the Scripture argues and says, no, you are his child. He has not abandoned you.

Good fathers often put their children through paces. And that's what's happening to you right now. Now, what does all this mean?

You know, there's a place in 1 John 3.20 where it says, when our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts. With a small paraphrase, I'm just going to say, when our hearts condemn us, the Holy Spirit is greater than our hearts. It's the Holy Spirit's job to argue.

Our hearts do not like the idea of grace. We don't really like the gospel, the idea that we're saved by grace. We want to earn it.

We want to merit it. It puts us in control. And because our hearts have got that part there, we're constantly being buffeted by fears, by doubts.

When bad things happen, we say, no, no, he's abandoned us. I'm not good enough. He can't possibly love me and the Holy Spirit comes in and argues.

He makes the case. He takes the gospel and pounds you until you start to relax. But it's not just that the Holy Spirit defends us against accusation.

He also defends us against temptation. In James 4, there's this strange spot where James first says, do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity toward God? And then it says, don't you realize, and again, they don't know how to translate this.

Don't you realize that the spirit of God within you envies you? Because sometimes they translate it lusts unto envy. They don't know how to translate.

You know what it's saying? It's saying don't you realize that when you start to let the world take you away from God that the Holy Spirit within you longs for your love? The Holy Spirit sees us giving our heart to money, or giving our heart to fame, or giving our heart to sex, or giving our heart to power instead of to God.

And then the Holy Spirit when it sees our hearts tempting us away from God, knowing this is going to destroy us. The Holy Spirit acts the way of a loving friend acts toward an addict. What do you do when you love somebody and you see them destroying their lives through addiction?

You get them into a corner and you say, you're killing yourself, I'm not going to let you do it. I'm going to confront you, I'm going to oppose you because I love you, I'm not going to let you do it. And you know what, you can almost come to blows over that.

You can have friends who come and tell you you're wrong, you're killing yourself, I'm not going to let you do it. You can get so angry at them that you can have a fight. But this is what we've got when we have the Holy Spirit in our lives.

This is a friend, this is a counselor, this is a legal advocate, this is someone who will not let you kill yourself. He's a glorious person and Paul says in Philippians 1, the good work God began in you, he will bring the completion of the day of Jesus Christ. He's a glorious person this Holy Spirit and he will not stop until you become the glorious person you should be.

He is going to oppose anything in your heart that will scuttle you. And he's not going to let you go. This is a friend whose love has teeth in it.

This is a friend who's utterly for you, which means sometimes he's against you for you. He said, I should have thought twice about inviting this person into my life. No, I just want you to think about the implications.

And therefore, yes, it's the job of the Holy Spirit to give you scripture. And then the job of the Holy Spirit to make that scripture real and vibrant and powerful in your life. But he's not simply doing it, you know, just to give you spiritual experiences.

He's come into your life and he's utterly committed to bringing the good work God began with you at the new birth to completion in the day of Jesus Christ. And he's not going to let you go. You see, he's a counselor.

He's not like a camp counselor. You don't go home. He's even not like a marriage counselor that you go to see.

And then you say, I'm not getting anything out of it. Okay. He's a permanent legal advocate.

He's a permanent friend who's willing to do interventions on you all the time. He's for you, para. But he sometimes can be against you for you.

And that's the wonder of having the Holy Spirit in your life. Now, lastly, very importantly, how can you be, well, I'm not going to say be full of the Spirit. We're going to go to that later.

But how can you be sure that you're receiving the benefits that the Holy Spirit can offer you? And I think there's two answers in this text. We're just sticking with the text.

There's certainly more to much more to say about the Holy Spirit than we have here. But we're going to stick with the text. And here's the first thing.

The key to the power of the Holy Spirit operating in your life and making you what you should be and can be is understanding the first advocate. See, when Jesus says, I'm going to send you another counselor. He's talking about himself.

Who's the first counselor? Him. He's the first counselor.

And this word, parapleg, parapleg, legal advocate is used of Jesus, too, by the same author, John, not in the book of John, but in the first epistle of John, where he says this. Now, this is the new international translation. He says, I write this to you.

This is first John 21. I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense.

Jesus Christ the righteous. He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins. Now, that's how the new international version renders it.

We have one who speaks to the Father in our defense. Actually, it just says we have an advocate with the Father. We have a parapleg we have an advocate with the Father.

And when the Bible says that when we sin, we have an advocate with the Father. If we believe in Jesus Christ, we have an advocate with the Father. Here's what the Bible is assuming.

Number one, it assumes that there is a bar of justice. There is a court before which all of us stand accused. That we're condemned.

And after 35 years, in fact, I realize that, you know, actually the first sermon I ever preached at my very first church 35 years ago was on 4th of July Sunday. And my 35 years of pastoral work, I've seen lots and lots of people who tried desperately to get out from under this idea that they're moral failures, this idea that they're condemned. One of the best ways to do it is to move New York City where you're going to be told what's right or wrong.

That's you create that yourself. You decide what is right or wrong for you. You don't let somebody else is moral.

You decide what is right or wrong for you. And for, you know, for a number of years, you say, see, I don't have to feel guilty. I decide what is right or wrong for me.

Until you realize there's not a single person on the face of the earth that even lives up to the standards that you have decided or right or wrong. And the standards that you apply to everybody else. And I don't care what happens.

It could be you're successful in the beginning of your life and then realizes life goes on that you've neglected your relationships and now you're lonely. Well, you're unsuccessful early in life and you feel like a failure because of that or you just suffering hits you and whenever suffering hits you, you realize you forces you to admit your moral flaws. Everybody in the end has a sense that they're condemned.

Everybody knows they're a moral failure. It sleeps very deep this sense in people for a long time and it might be sleeping deep in you. But there is a bar of justice.

There is a court before which we all stand accused, 0.1, 0.2. The second thing that this passage assumes is that when you believe in Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ stands before that just court of justice representing you, representing you, interceding for you, making his case for you. Now when I was a new Christian, I read that spot.

There's a place in Romans 8 where it says Jesus Christ ever lives to intercede. It's in Hebrews 7. It's in Romans 8 where it says Jesus Christ makes intercession for us before the Father.

And that was kind of a comfort for me because in my mind, what it meant was every time I sinned, Jesus walked up and said, don't abandon him because, you know, be merciful or something like that. You know, he, I know he promised not to do that anymore and he did it anymore. Let's give him one more chance.

I guess I thought that's what he was doing. And that wasn't very comforting to me because, you know, I always wonder how long can Jesus keep that up? You know, when is he finally going to say, I'm not going to the Father one more time for this guy?

Or when's the Father going to say, I'm sorry, you know, what this has been, you know, this has been five years now, you know, he says, it didn't comfort me until I read a, actually, a, a sermon outline by a man named Charles Hodge who was a, one of the, one of the professors at Princeton Theological Seminary in the 19th century, like in the 1830s and 1840s. And he gave a chapel talk on Jesus Christ as the advocate and something to change, changed my life long ago. He says, you know what?

Jesus Christ is your advocate. He is your legal representative before the, before the bar, before the, before the court. And one of the things you have to realize, he's not up there just pleading for mercy.

That is not what a legal advocate does. A legal advocate makes a case and he makes a case based on the law. And he's up there securing your status as not being condemned because of the law.

He's not up there pleading for mercy. He's making a case. I said, what?

And then this is what Charles Hodge says is something like what we think. The Bible is trying to convey when it talks about Jesus our legal advocate. It's almost as if, and I know this is, it's almost as if Jesus is saying, Father, you are just and sin demands payment.

And this brother or sister of mine has sinned. He's not loved guy with all his heart, soul, strength of mine. He hasn't loved his neighbors himself.

He is sinned and his sin must be paid for. But Father, here's the payment. Look at my broken body.

Look at my poor outblood. I have paid for it. And it would be unjust to get two payments for the same sin.

I've paid for it. And therefore, I'm not just pleading for mercy. I demand acquittal for my brother because I have paid for his sin.

And therefore he cannot pay for his sin. And therefore, there cannot be any condemnation of him. I demand acquittal.

It's justice that he's pleading for. See, that's what Charles Hodge was saying. And when I realize that, I hope you can come with me.

I'm trying to get across in three minutes with what was kind of a watershed for me. See, I realize all of the religion sort of see salvation as the scales. You know, the justice scales, you know, the blind lady with the scales, that's justice.

And all I thought was that the moral law of God, the divine justice was on one side of the scale. And I had to put in a ton of good works on the other side just so it didn't kill me. See, the justice of God was against me.

You better be good. You better be good. And I had to, you know, push up everything I possibly could out of my own life.

All the good deeds and all the prayers and going to church and everything. Get it on that other scale. Otherwise, just a balance out of otherwise, I'm just cooked.

And I realize that when you believe in Jesus Christ as your Savior, and when He becomes your legal advocate, it means that justice of God is on your side. It would be unjust for God to take two payments for the same sin. And your sins have been paid for.

And therefore, the very justice of God, the omnipotent, infallible, infinite justice of God, demands that there is no condemnation for you. Now, if we've got that advocate up there doing that, what is the Holy Spirit doing down here? The Holy Spirit is our advocate on earth.

Jesus Christ is our advocate in heaven. What the Holy Spirit is doing is He's taking the advocacy in heaven and applying it here on earth against the enemies in your own heart. He's pounding into you.

He's dealing with your temptations. He's dealing with your pride. He's dealing with your fears.

He's dealing with your accusations. And he's saying, look at what Jesus has done. The Holy Spirit, though, is not an advocate that points to himself.

J. I. Packer beautifully puts it.

It's in John chapter 16 where it actually says, Jesus says, the Holy Spirit will speak of me. He will glorify me. He will not speak of himself.

He will speak of me. And J. I.

Packer, who is an Anglican minister, one day was, he was preaching a sermon on the Holy Spirit and he was looking for a good illustration on the way to preach. He saw a floodlight. He was kind of dark at night.

And he saw a floodlight lighting up an old building which in the daytime didn't look very good, but at night looked beautiful. And he suddenly realized he couldn't even tell where the floodlight was. He says, I couldn't even tell because the job of the floodlight is not to call attention to itself.

The job of the floodlight is to throw into relief the beauty and the magnificence of the thing that is flooding. And he says, that's the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit's job is not to say, look at me.

Get my power. Get my joy. The Holy Spirit's job is to say, look at Jesus.

Look at the beauty of what he's done. Look at him standing up there. Look at his advocacy for you.

Do you not see that there's no danger? There is no failure. There is no accusation.

There is nothing that can overturn you. That can cast you down. Nothing.

The Holy Spirit's job is to pull. He's an advocate on earth pointing to our advocate in heaven, making the work of the advocate in heaven so beautiful to your life that it changes it. All right, look, two things.

Number one, here's two ways I would like you to change your life on the basis of what I've already said, even if you say, I've already got some things to change. All right, then these two things. Would you please notice the magnificence of divine selflessness, the magnificence of divine selflessness?

Here's Jesus Christ, emptying self of His glory in order to become a servant and die on the cross for our sins. And now, here's the Holy Spirit, not speaking of His own glory, but glorifying Jesus. There must be something deep in the heart of God that is other oriented.

There's a selflessness in God. There's something in God that says, my life for yours. There's something in God that says, I'm here to serve you.

Here's Jesus emptying self of His glory. Here's the Holy Spirit only showing us Jesus glory. Are you always promoting yourself?

Are you always upset because people aren't giving you your due? Do you feel like you're not getting credit? Do you find yourself always getting insulted?

How dare people talk to me like that or about me like that? Are you doing what a lot of New Yorkers are doing, spending all their time just trying to get up the ladder and basically only dealing with people if they serve you, serve your interest, help you with your agenda? If you want to be like the divine person who comes and lives in the heart of a Christian, you have to be a person who is characterized by the magnificence of divine selflessness.

Get rid of your pride. Stop promoting yourself all the time. Be like the one who lives within you.

But here's the second thing. Are you on the other hand? Do you feel like an imposter?

Are you struggling with rejection? In New York, there's always an audition. There's always a job interview.

There's always, and we're always struggling with rejection here. Are some of you struggling on off a lot? Do you feel like a failure in many ways?

Are you afraid to have any of the people around you realize how much you lack confidence? How much you right now almost load yourself? You need an advocate and you got one in heaven.

You got one on earth. You really got everything you need. Avail yourself of him.

Let's pray. Our Father, we thank You for the gift of the Holy Spirit. We thank You for sending another counselor into our lives.

Oh, how we do. Thank You for that. And we pray that You would help us to be filled with the Spirit.

We pray that You would help us to receive His counseling. We pray that You would help us to cooperate with Him as He advocates for us. And we ask that You would help us to do this as an entire church so we truly would be a Spirit-filled church.

The world will do this and You'll be grateful. You'll be glad for us. You'll be, we'll be grateful to You and You'll be glorified in us.

And that's what we want. We pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.

**讲员**: 提摩太·凯勒 (Tim Keller)


欢迎来到《福音与生活》。圣灵是谁？为什么圣灵的工作对基督徒的生活如此重要？圣经告诉我们，圣灵不仅是一个模糊的力量，而是一个在基督徒生活中以深刻方式工作的有位格的人。

今天，提摩太·基尔正在探讨圣灵如何召唤我们归信、使我们联合在一起、赋予我们恩赐并塑造我们成为更多像基督的人。今天的经文选自约翰福音第14章第16至26节。我还要求父，父就另外赐给你们一位保惠师，叫祂永远与你们同在，就是真理的圣灵。世人不能接受祂，因为不见祂，也不认识祂；你们却认识祂，因祂常与你们同在，也要在你们里面。

我不撇下你们为孤儿，我必到你们这里来。不久之后，世界不再看见我，但你们要看见我，因为我活着，你们也必要活著。从那天起，你们就知道我在父那里，你们在我里面，我也在你们里面。凡遵守我命令的，就是爱我；爱我的人，我父也必爱他，我也要爱他，并且要向他显现。

西门彼得问说：“主啊，为什么对我们要显自己，不叫世人呢？”耶稣回答说：“若有人爱我，就必遵守我的道；我父也必爱他，并且我们要到他那里去，与他同住。他如果不爱我，就不遵守我的道。你们听见的话不是我的，乃是差我来之父的话。

我将这些事告诉你们，是要叫你们在我里面存平安。在世上你们有苦难，但你们可以放心，我已经胜了世界。”这是主的吩咐。在这个夏天，由于假期的原因，这里有多位讲员，为了保持统一并确保我们共同努力，我们选择了一个共同的主题：从现在一直到九月中旬，我们将探讨圣经中关于圣灵教导的教义——圣灵论。

我的印象是，世界上有很多教会只谈论灵性经历，也有很多教会完全害怕这个话题，只想谈论教义和真理。但我认为解决这种失衡的方法就是圣灵的教义，因为当你越深入研究时，你会发现灵性和真理是紧密相连的。接下来几周我们将探讨这个问题。这是个引子，让我们看看这段伟大的经文向我们揭示了有关圣灵是谁、他做什么以及如何获得他的恩赐。

首先，他是谁？圣灵是谁呢？顺便说一下，我刚才已经通过使用代词给你们提供了一点答案。圣灵是一个个人的存在，是基督徒心中的神圣居民。

圣灵是基督徒心中的神圣居民。首先，他是一个人。你有没有注意到耶稣提到圣灵时，并没有用“它”这个词，而是用了“祂”，就像在以弗所书4:30中说的，“圣灵受了伤”。你可以伤害圣灵。

希伯来书10:29 说：“你们藐视神的儿子。” 罗马书15:16 说：“圣灵爱我们。” 所以他爱，他受伤，他被轻慢，一个无形的力量无法感受到这些情感，那是一个人。但他不仅是个人，也是神。

例如，在这里说，“我将祈求父，祂必另外赐给你们一位保惠师”。我们会稍后解释“保惠师”这个词的意思。但耶稣说，他是另一位保惠师，我是保惠师，他就是另一个。这里有两种希腊语用来表示“另一个”的词。

一个是 hetero，意思是实际上不同于先前的；另一个是 allos，意思是另外的或不同的。其他希腊文的词是 alos，意思和前面的一样。现在你要明白耶稣在这里说的话是什么意思，因为耶稣关于自己做了些巨大的宣称。耶稣在约翰福音8章里说：“在我还没有存在之前，我是。

” 耶稣拿起了摩西和燃烧的荆棘丛中神给的名字。耶稣说：“是我，我是。”在我还没有存在之前，我是。耶稣声称要赦免一切罪。

你知道**这意味着什么吗？当他说到“我可以赦免一切罪”，这就意味着所有的罪都是对他而言的，因为你只能赦免那些对你而言的罪。**耶稣说他要审判世界。所以耶稣不断地宣称自己与神是平等的。

现在他竟然胆敢说：“我要给你们派一个像我一样的人。” 圣灵是一个人，圣灵就是神，我们现在所探讨的是令人眼花缭乱的三一论教义。我能让你头晕吗？在这一章第二节中，我们没有读到的内容里，耶稣一直在说“我要离开”。

我要离开，好的。然后这里说到，在第16节，他说：“但是圣灵要来。”再往下到第21节，他又说：“我的父，我和你们同在。” 在第21、22和23节中，他继续说：“我们将会来到你们中间。

”所以他这样说：我要离开，圣灵要来，因此我也会再来。耶稣并不是说：“哦，我不是真的离开，我会以圣灵的形式来到你们这里。” 另一方面，当他说到“我要离开，而因此我不再回来”，他却说：“我是要回来的”。他是如此与圣灵合一，以至于当圣灵进入你的生命时，耶稣也来了。

然而他又不是完全与圣灵相同，以至于他不在天上。明白了吗？好的？看看这有多简单？

不，你知道吗，耶稣在这里说的是，并非有三个神，因为两个一合起来就是三个神。另一方面，也不是一个实体以三种形式存在。你知道的，在那里他有一半是他的父，一半是他的子，还有一半是圣灵。（原文中的比喻和幽默部分在翻译时尽量保留了原意，但可能无法完全传达出原文的幽默感。

） 它不是三个神，而是两个。一个负责这个，但也不是三位一体的形式，而是三个分别代表不同的形式。它是三位一神。而我们将在接下来的一年里重新探讨这一教义。

我可以告诉你，在我信仰初期，这对我来说是一个沉重的负担。我觉得太困惑了，但现在我认为这是最美好的事情之一。当我思考它时，这是我最大的喜悦之一。一旦你理解了这一点，你会发现它的美丽之处。

关于三一论的具体细节，我们今天不深入讨论，因为我们今天的话题是圣灵。但我希望你们能看到，为什么这如此重要。圣灵不是一个抽象的力量。圣灵是一个在你生命中存在的神圣人物。

为什么这很重要？哦，非常重要。因为圣经提到要被圣灵充满。之后我们会有一整场关于“被圣灵充满”的讲道。

但被圣灵充满意味着体验到无比的神圣喜乐和能力。我想要这种经历，我也希望你们能够拥有它。那么，你怎么才能被圣灵充满呢？如果你把圣灵看作是一个抽象的力量，你寻求的方式会与理解圣灵是个人不同。

如果你试图通过一个机械的方式来获取一个抽象的力量，比如东方思想中对神的看法。东方思想认为神是一个抽象的力量，并且他们通过冥想来接近这种力量，但冥想总是要清空思维、理性思考和言语。为什么？因为我们试图接触的是那种力量。

而在圣经中，你会发现“冥想”这个词出现得很多。如果你理解圣灵是个人，那么你寻求的方式就会完全不同。但是基督徒的默想、圣经的默想，并不是空空如也地让理性思想和言语消失。用神的话语充满心灵，这是一种完全不同的方法。

如果你这样认为，把圣灵当作一个“它”，那你就会采取一种机械的方法。事实上，我确实看到很多关于被圣灵充满的基督教教导，它们似乎将圣灵视为某种电荷。因此，要被圣灵充满，就是按某些方式祈祷、做某些事情、避免某些行为、为某些事悔改，就像是按对的按钮一样，让自己处于某种环境状态。然后它就进来了，不是“它”，不不。

如果圣灵是一个人，那么被圣灵充满就像被一个活生生的人充满一样。那会是怎样呢？比如说，我记得当我年轻的时候，有时候我的父母会接待一位来访者，在我们家里住上一两天，这位访客是他们非常尊敬的人，可能是贵宾、演讲嘉宾或者是他们很看重的家人。这会影响到一切。

首先，不知怎地，房子看起来特别漂亮。我们突然间把生活空间布置得井井有条，看上去格外整洁。其次，每个人都会表现得最好，而且这不是虚伪的表现。**关键是那些平时让我们感到不舒服的小事，现在都不再那么重要了，因为这个人在这里。**

被圣灵充满就是让自己的生命被那位住在你生命之墙内的荣耀人物的深刻意识所改变。我之前跟你们说过，记得曾经有个男人因为婚外情毁了自己的一生。他背叛了他的妻子。他曾告诉我，每当他想把他的情人带回家时，如果他的妻子是真正的妻子的话，他会先把她的照片拿掉。

他每次都要换照片，而且最近他告诉我，只要有任何一张妻子的照片，无论是他和妻子的合照还是单独妻子的照片，他都会立刻换掉。因为他和他的情人根本无法忍受妻子的照片。因为哪怕只是看到那张照片，也会影响他们的行为。你们知道谁住在你的心里吗？

你的生活被圣灵的洞见所融化了吗？有没有深刻意识到那位荣耀之人的存在，从而改变你的生活方式？仅仅这种意识会让你感受到祂的同在，并且让你的生活充满正直和诚实。如果你现在所做的事，如果没有意识到祂的存在是做不出来的。

你可以把照片翻过来，心想：“我可能会想一想。”当然，这也意味着要顺服圣灵的话语。被圣灵充满与被一种力量所充满是完全不同的。接下来我们要讲的是第二个要点。

圣灵是住在基督徒心内的个人神。其次，圣灵做了什么？这里有两句话告诉我们祂的作用，它们非常伟大。祂是真理的圣灵，约翰福音16章17节说；祂也是顾问。

祂既是真理的圣灵，又是顾问。首先，祂是真理的圣灵。**这意味着什么呢？一方面我们知道，圣灵基本上是圣经的作者。**

圣灵实际上就是圣经的作者。例如，在彼得后书1章21节中提到：“没有先知凭自己的愿望说预言；因为那预言不是用意志的权力说的，乃是被圣灵感动，凭着各人的信心说出来的。”再比如约翰福音6章63节，耶稣说：“赐生命的灵”就是“从天上来的道”。> 没有先知凭自己的愿望说预言；因为那预言不是用意志的权力说的，乃是被圣灵感动，凭着各人的信心说出来的。

（彼得后书1:21） > 赐生命的灵”就是“从天上来的道。（约翰福音6:63） 换句话说，你从圣经中看到的耶稣的话是由圣灵产生的。如果你接纳、接受并理解这些话，它们会给你带来永恒的生命。所以，在某种程度上，圣灵是圣经的作者。

事实上，这也回到了“被圣灵充满”这个概念上，如果圣灵是一个人而不是一种力量。如果你去看以弗所书5章18节，保罗著名的那段话中说：“要被圣灵充满”，然后他列出了一个充满圣灵生活的特征清单，我们暂时不讨论这些。我们后面会有一篇关于这个主题的讲道。以弗所书5章18节提到“要被圣灵充满”，然后接着列了一个清单。

如果你去看保罗写给哥林多教会的一封信，在歌罗西书3章16节中，它说：“要被圣经的话充满。”它又说：“要被圣经的话充满。” 然后它列出了一张圣经话充满生活的特征表。他说：“让圣经的话在你们里面丰富地居住”，这和“要被圣经的话充满”意思一样。

接着它列了一个特征清单，这些特征和以弗所书5章18节中提到的充满圣灵生活的特征是一样的。保罗在这两处都说了类似的话：一个充满圣灵生活的人，意味着什么？看，被一个人充满、被一个人支配，就是紧紧抓住那个人的每一句话。**这意味着被圣经话语完全包围和饱和。**

让圣经的话语在你里面丰富地居住，并不是简单知道这些信息并接受它们，而是要使它成为你自己的一部分。或者说，你可以看看眼镜，但这并不是我花这么多钱买它们的原因。我没有去眼科医生那里花了几百美元只为了坐在那儿对你说：“亲爱的，来帮我看看我的眼镜。”这并不是这样用的。

你戴上眼镜后，你会通过它们来看待一切事物。圣经也是如此：你可以说看圣经、学习事实，但更重要的是要让它成为你的一部分。让这些话语在你心中丰富地扎根，完全被它浸透，以至于你看万事万物都通过它来理解。因此，充满神的话语和圣灵是同一件事，因为他是真理的灵。

事实上，他超越了这一点。我们已经提到过这里，看第21节：“凡遵守我命令的，就是爱我的人；父必爱他，我也必爱他，并且要向他显现。”这很有趣。这意味着什么呢？

显然有一些人相信耶稣，显然他们也遵行耶稣的教导并且阅读神的话语，而耶稣说他会来向他们显明自己。这是在讲圣灵的这段经文里所说的：“我将要向他们显明自己。” 那么这个意思是什么呢？难道他们不认识他吗？

当然认识。这又是什么意思呢？圣灵是如何让话语变得有生命、赋予话语力量的呢？保罗在这里也提到这一点，听好了，对我来说这是《圣经》中最重要的一节经文之一。

这是在以弗所书3章中，保罗说：“我为你们祈祷，愿你们照他荣耀的丰富，在所有的智慧悟性上，知道神的奥秘。”他又说：“就是基督在你们心里成了有荣耀的盼望。我也为此劳苦，并且要加增你们力能，使基督因你们住在你们心里，根深蒂固，被坚固地扎根在爱里，能明白基督的爱是何等长阔高深。” 他是在对基督徒说话，说：“靠着圣灵的能力，我为你们祈祷，愿基督因信可以住在你们的心里。

”但基督已经在他们心中居住了。否则他们就不是基督徒了。然后他又说：“靠着圣灵的能力，我能帮助你们明白。” 能有力量去理解基督的爱是何等长阔高深。

难道他们不知道基督的爱吗？当然，他们已经是基督徒了。他说，但我要让你知道这爱胜过知识。他在说什么呢？

让我给你举个例子。约翰·金伯的灵修笔记本是一本小小的日记，他写道：“我多次在阅读圣经常常感到最大的喜悦，任何书籍都无法与之相比。很多时候，在阅读时，每一句话都似乎触动了我的心。” 我常常觉得每句话中都闪耀着如此多的光芒，并从中获得如此令人愉悦、陶醉的食物般的滋养，以至于无法继续我的阅读。

我常常会花很长时间琢磨一句话，试图理解其中蕴含的奇迹。当我读圣经时，对神的认识往往会突然在我心中燃起一种甜蜜的火焰，一种我难以言表的心灵秩序。虽然他在这里做得还不错。他在说什么呢？

光是阅读圣经是一件事。而圣灵来启示耶稣基督给你则是另一回事了。知道基督住在你心里是一回事，感受到祂的存在又是另一回事。我们上周实际上也谈到了这一点。

知道糖是甜的是一回事，品尝它并让整个身心都被其 electrified 另一回事。你不仅知道它，还感受到了它，这就是圣灵的工作。他是客观真理的作者，因为他写了圣经，也是主观真理的作者，他让你的生命中感受到它的鲜活和力量。他让你的生活充满活力、强大且改变人生，这是圣灵所做的第一件事。

但令人惊讶的是，这还不是全部。因为实际上，如果他只做到这些，他仍然只是一个顾问，或者只是在特定时间来给你某些东西的人。但他不只是这样。他还是一位顾问。

这就是这一整段的主要观点。我将请求父，祂会赐给你们另一位顾问。如果你去查五六个不同的译本，把所有的译本都找出来，你会发现有五个或六个不同的词。每当看到英语译本中有非常不同的词汇时，而且在每个译本中都是如此，**这意味着这里的这个词太丰富了，一个英语单词无法完全传达其意义，所以译者们都在努力。**

你们当中有些人可能拥有旧钦定版圣经，还有一些其他版本说：“我将请求父，祂会赐给你们另一位安慰者。”这个“安慰者”是一个非常温馨的词，但它确实让圣灵听起来像是一床被子。因此现在他们不再使用这个词了。但即使这个词是顾问的意思，这是一位夏令营顾问吗？

还是一位婚姻顾问？不是的。实际上，译者们知道一件事，这也是为什么我们没有一个合适的词来表达它的原因。基本上，评论家们知道这个单词是paracaleo、paracleic或paracleesis。

这是一个非常难以翻译的词。Para意味着不处于前面或后面，而是站在旁边。Caleo意味着宣告、召唤或争论。因此，最好的翻译方式是：我将给你们另一位辩护人。

诗篇可以深刻地塑造你与神交往的方式。即使耶稣也依靠诗篇来面对每一个情况，包括死亡。在提摩太和凯瑟琳·凯勒的365天灵修读物《耶稣的歌》中，你会找到每天通过诗篇的阅读，并获得新的圣经洞见。如果你没有定期灵修的习惯，这本书是一个很好的开始方式。

而如果你已经花时间在祷告中研读圣经，那么阅读和祷告诗篇可以帮助你将最深的情感和问题带到神面前，并发现与祂更深的亲密关系。我们将会为你寄送提摩太和凯瑟琳·凯勒的灵修读物作为感谢你的礼物，帮助福音与生命向更多人分享耶稣的爱。请访问gospelandlife.com/give 今天订购您的副本。这就是凯博士 凯勒和其他今天的教导一样。

这个词传达了意思，但一方面，这个人是属于你的。他站在你的立场上，代表你。这个人对你忠心到最后一刻。这是一个为你最坚强的人。

但另一方面，这也意味着这个人会争论。这个人会辩论。这个人会提出论据。这个人会为你辩护，对抗你的敌人。

这里有柔软的一面，即同情你；也有强硬的一面。那么，为什么耶稣基督要说圣灵是你的法律顾问呢？这又是什么意思？我认为这是指：圣灵的工作就是为你辩护，对抗地上的敌人，尤其是内心的敌人。

例如，在罗马书8章15节中，它说：“神没有赐给我们恐惧的心，而是赐给我们儿子的灵，使我们能呼喊‘阿爸父’。”你知道**这意味着什么？你心中充满了恐惧。**而圣灵进来争论并说：不，神爱你。

你是他的孩子。下一节罗马书8章16节说：“圣灵与我们的灵一同见证，我们是神的儿女。”我们在上周讨论过这一点，但没有提到的是，“见证”这个词在希腊语中是一个技术术语，意味着在法庭上的明星证人，一个带来法律证据的人，基本上可以解决案件。所以这句话的意思是：你心中充满了疑虑和恐惧。

而圣灵进来并说：不，没有什么理由怀疑。你是他的，你是被爱的。还有希伯来书12章的一个精彩段落，谈的是受苦和我们所遭遇的一切困难。在希伯来书12章中，它说：“你们忘记主的劝勉的话吗？

那是作为儿女对你说的。”希腊文中的这个词意味着：我的儿子，不要轻看主的管教，因为祂是爱管教你的人。希伯来书作者引用了箴言3章，并说圣经的工作就是在你沮丧时与你争论。当你遭受苦难时，它会提醒你。

坏事情发生在你身上。你觉得仿佛被遗弃了。然而，希伯来书的经文却在与你辩论。怎么辩论呢？

就像孩子对父母说：“不，你是我的父亲。”他没有抛弃你。好父亲常常会让孩子经历一些考验。现在，这正是你在经历的事情。

那么这一切意味着什么呢？你知道，在约翰一书3章20节中提到：“我们的心若责备我们，神比我们的心更大，一切事都审判我们。”我稍微改写一下，就是“当我们的心责备我们时，圣灵比我们的心更大”。这是圣灵的工作——他与你辩论。

我们的心不喜欢恩典的概念。我们真的不喜欢福音，即我们是因着恩典得救的这个想法。我们想要赚取它，想要配得上它，这让我们掌控一切。因为我们的内心有这种想法，所以我们常常被恐惧和疑虑所困扰。

当坏事发生时，我们会说：“不，他抛弃了我们。我不够好。”圣灵会进来与你辩论，他会为你辩护，用福音说服你，直到你开始放松下来。但这不仅仅是圣灵在为我们辩护免受指责。

他还保护我们不受诱惑的侵害。雅各书4章有一段奇怪的文字：首先说：“你们岂不知和世人交好就是在神面前结了仇吗？”然后又说：“岂不知。”他们不知道如何翻译这一句。

它实际上说的是什么？它说：“你难道没有意识到，当你开始让世界占据你的内心时，圣灵在你里面渴望得到你的爱吗？”圣灵看到我们把心给了金钱、名声、性或权力，而不是给神。然后圣灵看见我们的心被引诱远离神，知道这会毁掉我们。

圣灵就以一个爱的朋友对待瘾君子的方式行事。当你爱一个人，并且看到他们因着成瘾而毁掉自己的生命时，你会怎么做？你会把他逼到角落里，说：“你是在自毁啊！我不会让你这么做的。

我要面对你，反对你，因为我爱你，我不允许你这么做。”你知道吗？有时甚至会因此争执起来。你可以有朋友来告诉你，你在错，你是在自毁，我不会让你这么做的。

你会因此非常生气以至于和他们争吵。但这就是当我们有了圣灵在我们生命中时的情景。这是一位朋友，一位辅导员，一位法律顾问，他绝不会让你自毁。他是荣耀的，保罗在腓立比书1章说：“神从起初拣选你们，为要你们因我们的福音，受救赎，荣耀归于神。

”这位圣灵是荣耀的，他不会停止直到你成为应该成为的那个荣耀的人。他会反对任何会把你打翻在地的想法，并且不让你离开。这是一位有力量之爱的朋友。这是一位完全为你着想的朋友，**这意味着有时他是反对你的为了你好。**

他说：“我本该再三考虑邀请这个人进入我的生活。”不是的，我只是希望你想想后果。因此，是圣灵的工作给你圣经，然后让这些圣经的话语在你的生命中变得真实、生动和有力。但他不只是为了给你带来属灵的经历。

他进入了你的生命，并且完全致力于将你在重生时神开始的好工作，在耶稣基督的日子完成。他不会让你离开。你看，他是你的辅导员。他不像夏令营的辅导员，你回家了就结束了。

他甚至不像婚姻咨询师，你可以去见一次然后说：“我从中学不到什么。”他是一位永久的法律顾问。圣灵的工作就是如此，他不会停止直到你成为神为你预定的那个荣耀的人。他是一位永恒的朋友，随时愿意对你进行干预。

他是为你好的，帕拉。但他有时也会在你身上表现出反对的态度。这就是拥有圣灵的生命中的奇妙之处。最后，非常重要的一点是，你怎么才能确保自己能够获得圣灵所能提供的益处呢？

我认为这个问题的答案在这段经文中可以找到。我们只关注这段文本的内容。虽然关于圣灵还有很多更深层次的东西我们可以探讨，但我们要紧贴这段文本。关键在于什么能让圣灵在你生命中发挥力量，并使你成为应该成为的人？

答案在于理解第一个辩护者。当耶稣说他会给你们另一位辅导员时，他指的是他自己。谁是第一个辅导员呢？就是他。

他是第一个辅导员。这个“parapleg”这个词，在约翰福音的同一位作者约翰在他的第一封书信中也用到了。他在那里说到：“我写这信给你们是叫你们不犯罪。但有人犯罪，我们有一位辩护者与父相交，就是耶稣基督公义的。

” 新国际译本这样翻译。实际上，原文只是说“我们有位辩护者在父面前为我们辩护”。我们有一个辩护者在父面前。当圣经说当我们犯了罪，我们在父面前有一个辩护者。

如果我们相信耶稣基督，我们在父面前就有辩护者。这里圣经假设了几件事： 首先，它假定有一个公义的法庭，在这个法庭前，我们所有人都被控告，并且被判有罪。经过35年，事实上我意识到，其实我在35年前第一次牧会的那一天，是美国独立日星期天。在这35年的牧师生涯中，我见过很多人努力摆脱自己是道德失败者、被定罪的想法。

其中一种方法就是搬到纽约市，在那里你会被告知什么是对错。你创造了自己的对错标准，你自己决定什么是对错，而不是让别人来评判你的道德。你决定什么是对错。在一段时间里，你说：“看，我不需要感到内疚。

我自己决定什么是对错。” 直到有一天你意识到，世界上没有一个人能达到你为自己设定的对错标准，也没有人能达到你给别人设定的标准。无论发生什么事。也许你在生命早期很成功，但后来忽视了人际关系，现在变得孤独；或者你在生命早期不成功，因此感到失败，或者突如其来的痛苦让你认识到自己的道德缺陷。

每个人最终都会有一种被定罪的感觉，知道自己是道德上的失败者。这种感觉在人们心中根深蒂固，可能也在你的心中沉睡着。但有一个公正的法庭，在那里我们都被指控。罗马书8:34提到：“耶稣基督已经得尊贵荣耀，超越一切，以致于他要向那审判活人死人的主活着。

”这是希伯来书7章25节和罗马书8章34节的内容。这段经文还假设了另一件事：当你相信耶稣基督时，耶稣基督站在那个公义的法庭前为你辩护，为你的利益进行调解，替你向父神提出上诉。当我刚开始信主的时候，读到了这一点。在罗马书8章中有提到：“耶稣基督已经得尊贵荣耀，超越一切，以致于他要向那审判活人死人的主活着。

”这是希伯来书7:25和罗马书8:34的内容。而且这对我来说也是一种安慰，因为在我的思维里，**这意味着每次我犯错时，耶稣都会走过来对我说：“不要放弃他，你知道的，要慈悲一点。**”我知道他承诺不会再这样做了，所以他也不会再这样做。让我们给他一次机会吧。

我想这就是他在做的吧。但这并不是一种安慰，因为我总是想知道耶稣能这样坚持多久？最终他会说：“我已经不再为了这个人去父那里了。” 或者天父会说：“对不起，你知道的，这已经持续了这么多年，他还是没有完全爱你。

”直到我读了一篇由查尔斯·霍奇牧师撰写的讲道提纲，他是19世纪普林斯顿神学院的一位教授，在1830年代和1840年代。他在一次礼拜活动中谈到了耶稣基督作为辩护人的话题，这改变了我的一生。他说： 耶稣基督是你的辩护人。他是在法庭上为你辩护的法律代表。

你必须意识到的是，他不是在那里仅仅请求宽恕。那不是一个律师的工作。一个律师会为他的客户做案情陈述，并根据法律来构建这个案件。他在那里确保你在法律面前不会被定罪。

他不是在请求宽恕，而是在做案情陈述。我说，什么？然后查尔斯·霍奇牧师说，圣经试图通过谈论耶稣作为我们的辩护人时传达的正是这种想法。就好像耶稣在对天父说：“父亲，你是公义的，罪有应得。

” 我的这个兄弟或姐妹犯了罪，并没有全心全意地爱你，也没有爱他的邻舍。他犯了罪，必须付出代价。但父亲，这是支付方式。看看我这被钉伤的身体。

看看我这流出的血。我已经为你付出了代价。如果对同一个罪重复收费是不公正的，那么就不要再收第二次了。我已经付了赎金。

因此，我不是在哀求怜悯，而是在为我的兄弟要求无罪释放，因为我已经替他偿还了罪债。所以他不能再为自己的罪负上代价。因此，对他来说就没有定罪的理由了。我要要求无罪释放。

这是他在寻求的公义。你看，这就是查尔斯·霍奇所说的。当我意识到这一点时，我希望你能跟我一起来思考这个问题。我试图在三分钟内传达对我而言的一个重要转折点。

事实上，我发现许多宗教都把救赎比作天平。你知道，正义的天平，那个盲眼的女士拿着的天平，那就是正义。我一直认为，上帝的道德律法和神圣的公义在天平的一端，而我必须在另一端积累大量的善行，以免被压垮。也就是说，上帝的公义对我不利。

你一定要做好人。你一定要做好人。所以我不得不尽我所能地从生活中积累一切好事、祈祷、去教会等等，把它们放到另一边，否则就无法平衡，否则我就完了。当我相信耶稣基督作为我的救主时，当祂成为我的辩护律师时，这就意味着上帝的公义站在了你的这边。

如果上帝要接受两次支付同一个罪的赎金，那是不公正的。你的罪已经被偿还了。因此，上帝那无所不能、无可挑剔、无穷无尽的正义要求你没有任何定罪的理由。既然我们在天上有了这样的辩护律师，那么圣灵在人间又在做什么呢？

圣灵是我们地上的辩护律师。耶稣基督是我们的辩护律师在天父那里。圣灵所做的就是将天上的辩护应用到地上，对抗你心中的敌人。祂不断地敲打你的心，处理你的诱惑、骄傲、恐惧和指控。

但圣灵并不是一个指向自己的辩护律师。J.I.派克完美地表达了这一点。在约翰福音16章，耶稣实际上说：“圣灵要为我作见证。他要荣耀我。

他必不独说自己的事。” J.I.帕克是一个英国国教会牧师，在一次讲道时寻找一个合适的比喻。那天晚上天色较暗，他在路上看到一盏探照灯。那盏探照灯照亮了一座旧建筑，白天看起来并不怎么样，但到了夜晚却显得非常美丽。

他忽然意识到自己根本看不见探照灯的位置。他说：“我甚至都看不出来，因为探照灯的工作不是为了引起人们的注意。” 探照灯的职责是突出和强调被照射事物的美丽与壮丽。他说：“这就是圣灵。

圣灵的职责不是让人说：‘看看我吧。’享受我的能力，体验我的喜乐。圣灵的职责是让人说：‘看看耶稣吧。’ 看看他所成就的美善。

看看他在那里站立。看看他为你辩护。你看不到危险吗？没有失败。

没有指控。没有什么可以颠覆你、把你打倒的东西。圣灵的工作就是拉近，他是地上的辩护者，指向我们天上的辩护者，让天上的辩护者的工在你的生命中变得如此美丽，以至于改变它。好吧，有两点。

首先，基于我刚才所说的内容，请允许我在你们的生活中做出两个改变。即使你说你已经有了一些需要改变的地方。好的，那么这两点是：请留意神自我牺牲的伟大，神自我牺牲的伟大。耶稣基督空出自己的荣耀，成为仆人，在十字架上为我们死。

现在，圣灵不谈论自己的荣耀，而是荣耀耶稣。神心中一定有一种以他人为中心的深刻东西。神有无私的一面。在神里面有一种说：“我的生命为你。

”有一种说：“我在这里服侍你。”的东西。这里耶稣是空出自己荣耀，圣灵也只向我们显明耶稣的荣耀。你总是自我吹嘘吗？

你是否总是在乎别人没有给你应有的尊重？你觉得自己的功劳没有得到认可吗？你是不是经常感到被冒犯？怎么敢这样对我或说我呢？

你是不是像很多纽约人一样，整天想着往上爬，只和对你有用的人打交道？如果你想要成为住在基督徒心中的神圣人物，你就必须是一个以神的谦卑为荣的人。放下你的骄傲。停止不停地自我吹嘘。

要做那个住在你心里的人。但这里还有第二点。另一方面，你觉得你是冒牌货吗？你是否在挣扎于被拒绝的感觉？

在纽约，总有试镜，总有面试。总是在挣扎着被拒绝。你们中有些人是不是经常感到挫败？你觉得在很多方面都失败了吗？

你害怕周围的人发现你的自信不足？现在几乎把自己压垮了？你需要一个辩护人，在天上你已经有了。在地上你也有了。

你真的拥有一切需要的东西。去寻求他吧。让我们祷告。我们的父，我们感谢你赐给我们圣灵的恩典。

我们感谢你为我们差派另一位顾慰者进入我们的生活。哦，我们多么感激！求你帮助我们被圣灵充满。求你帮助我们接受他的指导。

求你帮助我们在祂的带领下合作，为我们的辩护。愿你在整个教会中帮助我们这样做，使我们真正成为充满圣灵的教会。世界会这样，你会为此感谢我们。我们会感谢你，并且你会因我们而荣耀。

这就是我们所想要的。我们以耶稣的名祷告。阿们。谢谢大家今天听道。

我们祷告你们被今天的教导鼓励，并能将福音应用到生活中，也愿意与他人分享。想要了解更多来自提姆·凯勒牧师的资源，请访问gospelandlife.com。在那里，你可以订阅《在福音中的生命》季度期刊。订阅后，你还将获得免费的文章、讲道、灵修材料和其他许多以福音为中心的资源。
