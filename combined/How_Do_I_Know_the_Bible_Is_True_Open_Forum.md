## 引言与经文朗读 / Introduction and Scripture Reading

Welcome to Gospel in Life. How comfortable are you when it comes to being open about your faith? This month on the podcast, Tim Keller looks at what the Bible says about having a public faith.

He shows us what it looks like to be open about our faith in a pluralistic society in a way that creates civility and peace and meaningful dialogue with our neighbors. It is very common for a lot of people, even people who want to live the Christian life to feel that they've got to check their brains at the door. A lot of people will say to me, I know that probably Christianity isn't really true, but I want it to be true or I live a general Christian life, but I know that there's all sorts of problems with the historical accounts.

If you go to college, generally in religion 101 or philosophy 101, if you read the newspaper, you'll get this basic approach to the Bible. It goes like this. Number one, the Bible, the Gospels, were written down after years of legends and oral tradition circulated about Jesus Christ over the years, amongst the followers.

Many years after the event, somebody, some gospel writers wrote down these accounts. We really don't know how much of those accounts are factual and how much of them are not. They're embellished, you see, with all sorts of miraculous and fantastic incidents, which was, of course, the want of ancient people, pre-modern people, pre-scientific age.

When we read the Bible, we have a lot of trouble knowing what's true and what's not. There's a very well-publicized group of scholars called the Jesus Seminar that you probably read about every year, usually USA Today puts a front page article about it. What they do is they go through the Bible and they color code the Bible, biblical verses.

What they'll do is they'll give red, if they say Jesus probably said this, it probably really happened. They give pink if it might be true. They give gray if it's probably not true and they give black if it's not true at all.

And generally, the Jesus Seminar says no more than 15 to 20 percent of what the Bible actually says happened, really happened, no more than 15 or 20 percent of what Jesus is purported to have said, really was said. I don't think that's true. You have your handouts yet?

You got something there? Let me give you a quick run through the argument. Now after I'm done with this, I'm going to take 10 minutes at least.

We will take questions up here. You might want to be questioning the left brain, which is me. I think it's the left brain, the rational, or you might be wanting to question the right brain, which is Bruce over here, the imaginative, and I actually, I have some imagination and Bruce is quite rational, but at least for tonight, we're representing.

You need some more? We have a few more, yeah. Here we go.

欢迎来到"生命福音"。当谈到公开表达你的信仰时，你感到多自在呢？这个月在我们的播客中，提摩太·凯勒将探讨圣经对于拥有公开信仰的教导。

他向我们展示，在一个多元化的社会中，以一种能够创造文明、和平以及与邻舍之间有意义对话的方式，公开表达我们的信仰是什么样子的。对于很多人来说，甚至包括那些想要过基督徒生活的人，常常会觉得他们必须在门口就把大脑交出去。很多人会对我说，我知道基督教可能不是真的，但我希望它是真的；或者说，我过着一般的基督徒生活，但我知道历史记载有各种各样的问题。

如果你去上大学，通常在宗教学101或哲学101课程上，如果你读报纸，你会得到这种对圣经的基本态度。它是这样的：第一，圣经，福音书，是在关于耶稣基督的传说和口头传统在信徒中流传多年之后才被写下来的。

许多年后，某个人，某些福音书作者写下了这些记载。我们真的不知道这些记载中有多少是事实，有多少不是。你看，它们被各种神迹和奇异的事件所修饰，这当然是古代人、前现代人、前科学时代的人的习惯。

当我们读圣经时，我们很难知道什么是真的，什么不是。有一个非常出名的学者团体叫做"耶稣研讨会"，你可能每年都会读到相关报道，通常《今日美国》会在头版刊登关于它的文章。他们做的是通过圣经，给圣经经文进行颜色编码。

他们会这样做：如果他们说耶稣可能说过这话，这可能真的发生了，他们就标红色。如果可能是真的，就标粉色。如果可能不是真的，就标灰色；如果根本不是真的，就标黑色。

总的来说，耶稣研讨会说，圣经中所说发生的事情，真正发生的不超过15%到20%；耶稣据称说过的话，真正说过的不超过15%或20%。我不认为那是真的。你们拿到讲义了吗？

你们有东西吗？让我快速给你们过一遍论证。现在，在我讲完这个之后，我至少要花10分钟。

我们会在这里接受提问。你可能想要问左脑，就是我。我想是左脑，理性的一方；或者你可能想要问右脑，就是布鲁斯，富有想象力的一方。实际上，我也有一些想象力，布鲁斯也相当理性，但至少今晚，我们是这样代表的。

你们需要更多吗？我们还有一些，是的。来吧。

## 论证大纲：三阶段证据 / The Case Outline: Three Stages of Evidence

If you look at this, let me give you a case. Tonight I am not making a case on this sheet for the authority of the Bible. I'm not trying to say, I'm not saying, here's the argument for why we have to believe everything the Bible teaches.

I'm sure on here you have a case that the Bible is historically reliable, that the Jesus that shows you really happened, he really existed. Here's the argument outline, three stages, and then I'll try to break it down. Number one, if you honestly look at what the gospels claim, you will see they're not written as legends or fiction, they are either historical accounts or a deliberate hoax that's right on the front versus argument outline.

The gospels are not written as legends, they claim to be historical documents, so they are either deliberate hoaxes or else they are historically reliable documents. Number one, number two, we now know, we did in 50 years ago, that all the gospels were written within the lifetime, 30 to 60 years after Jesus died, within the lifetime of eyewitnesses. And since they were written within the lifetime of eyewitnesses, within the lifetime of thousands who heard in saw Jesus, it's very unlikely they were a hoax.

Number three. As long as you don't come with a built in bias against miracles, we conclude that if you refuse the evidence for the history of the gospels, we have to refuse to admit that we can know anything about antiquity, for the same rules of historiography used on other documents show the gospels to be trustworthy as well. That's the case.

The Bible tells us that there was a man named Jesus who claimed to be God who did many, many miracles that people saw. When he died on the cross, after that he was raised from the dead, at least hundreds of people saw him raised from the dead. Those are historical facts, and the Bible gives them to us.

Now let me just quickly run through what I just mentioned as how do you judge any historical document? How do you make decisions that any ancient, here's Caesar's Gallic Wars, here's Herodotus theucidides, all these guys that had written histories. Why do we trust them?

As basically reliable. We're not saying that they're inherent, but it's basically reliable. Why do you trust them?

如果你看这个，让我给你一个论证。今晚在这张纸上，我不是在为圣经的权威性辩护。我不是要说，我不是在说，这就是为什么我们必须相信圣经所有教导的论据。

我在这里给出的论证是，圣经在历史上是可靠的，福音书中向你展示的耶稣真的发生了，他真的存在。这是论证大纲，分三个阶段，然后我会试着分解它。第一，如果你诚实地看福音书的声称，你会看到它们不是作为传说或虚构写成的，它们要么是历史记载，要么是蓄意的骗局——这就在论证大纲的前面。

福音书不是作为传说写的，它们声称是历史文献，所以它们要么是蓄意的骗局，要么就是历史上可靠的文献。第一点。第二，我们现在知道，50年前我们就知道了，所有的福音书都是在耶稣死后30到60年内写成的，在见证人的有生之年内。既然它们是在见证人的有生之年内写成的，在成千上万听到和看到耶稣的人的有生之年内，它们不太可能是骗局。

第三点。只要你不带着对神迹的固有偏见，我们可以得出结论，如果你拒绝福音书历史的证据，我们就必须拒绝承认我们能知道任何关于古代的事情，因为用于其他文献的同样的历史编纂规则表明福音书也是值得信赖的。这就是论证。

圣经告诉我们，有一个叫耶稣的人，他声称自己是神，他行了很多很多人们看到的神迹。当他死在十字架上后，他从死里复活了，至少有数百人看到他复活了。这些是历史事实，圣经把它们给了我们。

现在让我快速过一遍我刚才提到的，你如何判断任何历史文献？你如何对任何古代文献做出决定，这里有凯撒的《高卢战记》，这里有希罗多德、修昔底德，所有这些写历史的人。我们为什么相信它们？

基本上是可靠的。我们不是说它们是无误的，但基本上是可靠的。你为什么相信它们？

## 书目测试 / The Bibliographic Test

There's several rules, and if you, several tests that you give to historical documents, and if you give those tests to the Bible, it comes out as a reliable historical document too. Here are the tests. Number one, and this one I won't even read through, the bibliographic test.

If somebody, pardon me, he's got one. You don't have one. How did you not get one?

Did you save one? The bibliographic test, you can always get more. When it comes to handouts, it's sort of like mana.

It'll come down every day, it'll just appear. The bibliographic test, I won't mention unless somebody brings it up later. Some people say, well, we don't have the originals, so how do we know?

The fact is that we don't have the originals, but we have hundreds of documents within a few decades, hundreds of copies within a few decades of the originals, and so nobody really denies that we have essentially what originally was written by the gospel writers. If anybody's got a problem with that, I'll go into that. That's number one.

---

有几个规则，如果你，有几个测试可以应用于历史文献，如果你把这些测试应用于圣经，它也会显示为一个可靠的历史文献。这些是测试。第一个，这个我甚至不会读，书目测试。

如果有人，对不起，他有一份。你没有一份。你怎么没拿到？

你保存了一份吗？书目测试，你总是可以得到更多。当涉及到讲义时，有点像吗哪。

它会每天降下来，它就会出现。书目测试，我不会提到，除非有人稍后提出。有些人说，嗯，我们没有原件，所以我们怎么知道？

事实是我们没有原件，但我们有数百份文献，在原件出现后的几十年内，在原件出现后几十年内有数百份副本，所以没有人真正否认我们基本上拥有福音书作者最初写的内容。如果有人对此有问题，我会深入讨论。这是第一点。

## 体裁测试：历史非传说 / The Genre Test: History Not Legend

Number two, this is important. The genre test. If you want to know whether historical documents are historical, an ancient document that is, you have to ask yourself, was it written to be a history?

Was it written as a myth? Was it written as an epic? Was it written as a legend?

That's very convenient to say the gospels are legends. People on the street will tell you that all the time. You say, ah, well, the gospels, they're not history, they were myths, they were legends.

But the problem is that the gospels in two ways rule that out as a possibility. Number one, the gospels claim to be historical accounts. Now, Bruce didn't do the very, very first part of Luke, but in the very, very beginning of Luke, we read, Luke says, let's see if I can find it here, in the very beginning of Luke, you would know it.

Many others, well, yeah, I'm just giving you this section. Actually, that's when I was going back to, ah, you're right, you did say that, I heard it, but it's how I sat down, you had gone through it. Many others have drawn up accounts of Jesus' life, just as they were handed down to us by the eyewitnesses.

So I have made a careful investigation of everything from the beginning and written in orderly accounts so that you may know the certainty of these things. You did say that? But in King James English.

Right. Now, Luke, therefore, is telling us that the gospels were written in four stages. Number one, and I have these in here, first of all, they were eyewitnesses who testified to what they saw.

Number two, the eyewitness accounts were handed down. 50 years ago, modern scholarship believed that the gospel accounts were circulated through oral tradition for years and years and embellished, and therefore it was a kind of whisper down the valley phenomenon. You know how you do whisper down the valley?

Somebody whispers one person's ear by the time it gets to the end of a string of 10 persons that comes out different. People change it in the, they hear it wrong and they change it in the transmission. We now know that the way rabbis in Judaism did their teaching was they would give the disciples an account and make them memorize it rigidly.

It was absolutely never done that the disciples who were getting this from the rabbi would make revisions. And so we know that the way in which accounts were handed down was through rigid memorization. And so if Luke was getting accounts from eyewitnesses, they would have been handed down for a number of years, but they certainly wouldn't have been monkeyed with.

So he says they were handed down. The number three, he says other accounts had already been written before he wrote. There were earlier gospels, we don't have them, but they'd already been written down.

But then last of all, Luke says that he checked them out. And the way he checked them out would have been the way any kind of writer would have checked them out. He would have made an early investigation.

He probably would have checked written records out that he had to make sure what he wrote down didn't contradict them. He would have interviewed eyewitnesses that were still around to check out his accounts. So what Luke is saying is not I wrote a legend.

Luke is saying I made every effort to make sure that what I wrote to you, what I am writing, is an absolutely accurate and historical account. But not only that, the gospel forms do not fit other fictional genres of the time. Even if you didn't have these kinds of claims, the gospel writer of John claimed to be an eyewitness.

Luke claimed to use eyewitnesses. C. S.

Lewis, who was a literature, a guy who wrote and was an expert on literature. He taught at Oxford and Cambridge, taught medieval and Renaissance literature. He points out something that boy made a big difference to me.

He says, when people say the gospels were fiction, they were myths, they were legends. He says, you have to remember that when the gospels were written, there was no such thing as realistic prose fiction. Today we have something called a novel.

In a novel, you have realistic fiction. It's written like a historical account. The person went to the door, turned the knob, sweat was dripping from his nose.

You read fiction like that, but not then. See, the fictional forms then, Lewis says, were apocalyptic writing, legend, tragedy, and parable, and they were not realistic prose. And so Lewis points this out.

He says something has to be said about the history of the gospels. I was a professional literary critic. And I thought I did know the difference between legend and historical writing.

That the gospels were certainly not legends, in one sense, they're not good enough. They aren't good enough. Now, Bruce did a pretty good job, but what Lewis is trying to say is if you're really writing fiction, there's too many little details that are put in there that really have nothing to do with the plot.

He says, if they are not history, they are realistic prose fiction of a kind that actually never existed before the 18th century. Little episodes like Jesus writing in the dust when they brought him the woman taken an adultery, which have no doctrinal significance at all are the mark of it. So what do you see the second point you've got here is either the gospels or total hoaxes deliberate lies or else they're historical documents, but the one thing you can't say is well, they're legends.

第二点，这很重要。体裁测试。如果你想知道历史文献是否是历史性的，一个古代文献，你必须问自己，它是作为历史写的吗？

它是作为神话写的吗？它是作为史诗写的吗？它是作为传说写的吗？

说福音书是传说是非常方便的。街上的人会一直告诉你这个。你说，啊，嗯，福音书，它们不是历史，它们是神话，它们是传说。

但问题是，福音书在两个方面排除了这种可能性。第一，福音书声称是历史记载。现在，布鲁斯没有讲路加福音最开始的部分，但在路加福音的最开始，我们读到，路加说，让我看看我能不能在这里找到，在路加福音的最开始，你会知道的。

许多其他人，嗯，是的，我只是给你这一部分。实际上，那是当我回到，啊，你是对的，你确实说了，我听到了，但是你怎么坐下的，你已经讲过了。许多其他人已经编写了耶稣生平的记述，正如那些目击者传给我们的。

所以我从头开始仔细调查了一切，写成有序的记述，好让你知道这些事的确实性。你说过吗？但用的是钦定本英语。

对。现在，因此路加告诉我们福音书是分四个阶段写成的。第一，首先，有目击者为他们所看到的作见证。

第二，目击者的记述被传下来。50年前，现代学术界认为福音记载是通过口头传统流传多年并被修饰的，因此是一种"传话游戏"现象。你知道传话游戏怎么玩吗？

有人在一个人的耳边低语，到了一串10个人的末尾时，出来的就不同了。人们在传播中改变它，他们听错了，然后在传递中改变它。我们现在知道，拉比在犹太教中教学的方式是，他们会给门徒一个记述，让他们严格记忆。

绝对不允许接受拉比教导的门徒进行修改。所以我们知道，记述传下来的方式是通过严格的记忆。所以如果路加从目击者那里得到记述，它们会被传下来好些年，但肯定不会被篡改。

所以他说它们被传下来了。第三，他说在他写之前，其他记述已经被写下来了。有更早的福音书，我们没有它们，但它们已经被写下来了。

但最后，路加说他核实了它们。他核实它们的方式，就是任何一种作者核实的方式。他会进行早期调查。

他可能会查阅他所能得到的书面记录，以确保他写下的内容不与它们矛盾。他会采访仍然在世的目击者来核实他的记述。所以路加说的不是我写了一个传说。

路加说的是我尽了一切努力确保我写给你的，我正在写的，是一个绝对准确的历史记述。但不仅如此，福音的形式不符合当时的其他虚构体裁。即使你没有这些声称，约翰福音的作者声称自己是目击者。

路加声称使用了目击者。C.S.路易斯，他是一个文学家，一个写作和文学方面的专家。他在牛津和剑桥教书，教授中世纪和文艺复兴文学。他指出了一些对我产生了很大影响的东西。

他说，当人们说福音书是虚构的，是神话，是传说时。他说，你必须记住，当福音书被写下来时，还没有现实主义散文小说这样的东西。今天我们有一种叫做小说的东西。

在小说中，你有现实主义虚构。它像历史记述一样写成。那个人走到门前，转动门把手，汗水从他的鼻子上滴下来。

你会读这样的虚构，但当时不是这样。你看，当时的虚构形式，路易斯说，是启示录式的写作、传说、悲剧和比喻，它们不是现实主义散文。所以路易斯指出这一点。

他说必须说一下福音书的历史。我是一个专业的文学评论家。我想我确实知道传说和历史写作之间的区别。

福音书肯定不是传说，从某种意义上说，它们不够好。它们不够好。现在，布鲁斯做得很好，但路易斯想说的是，如果你真的在写虚构，会有太多与情节无关的小细节被放进去。

他说，如果它们不是历史，它们就是18世纪之前实际上从未存在过的现实主义散文虚构。像耶稣在尘土中写字这样的小插曲，当他们把那个行淫时被抓的妇人带到他面前时，这些根本没有教义意义，这是它的标志。所以你在这里看到的第二点是，福音书要么是彻底的骗局、蓄意的谎言，要么就是历史文献，但你不能说的一件事是，嗯，它们是传说。

你不能这么说。第三个历史学测试是佐证测试。如果你有一个历史文献，出现的问题是，有没有办法知道其他见证人、其他权威佐证了这个见证？

## 佐证测试 / The Corroboration Test

You can't say that. The third historic test of historiography would be the corroboration test. If you have a historical document, the question that comes up is, is there any way to know that other witnesses, other authorities corroborate the testimony?

And we have a lot of corroboration. We have some historical witnesses we still have, and then we have some witnesses we don't have. Now, look, the witnesses we still have, here, Tacitus, who was a Roman historian, wrote in 1815, writes that in 64 AD, Nero punished the Christians, and then he says, Christ was executed when Tiberius was emperor by the order of the procurator, Pontius Pilate.

I was a Samaritan historian named Stalas writing in AD 52, wrote a history of the world and he included the fact that there was also an eclipse of the sun on the day that Jesus was crucified, something that the Bible talks about, the darkness. Plenty of the younger, AD 112 mentions Christ and how his followers worshipped him as God. Josephus was a historian, a Jewish historian, who wrote in AD AD, and recently, some people question whether Josephus' history has been doctored up by Christians because he says some strong things about Jesus.

However recently we've discovered some very old documents, some copies, there's a 10th century copy of Josephus written in Arabic that was dug up somewhere in the Near East, and we're pretty sure that this would have been pretty much the original, and he says this. He says Jesus' disciples reported that he had appeared to them three days after his crucifixion, and that he was alive. Accordingly he was perhaps the Messiah concerning whom the prophets have recounted wonders.

So you put these guys together, and outside of the Gospels you have got corroboration from other historical authorities that the basic outline of the Gospel account. Jesus existed, claimed to be God, he did miracles, he was crucified, he was seen by his followers as physically raised from the dead, that's the basics. But the stronger corroboration is what I may have already mentioned, exerted by European scholarship, that the Gospels and Acts did not exist before the 3rd century, the 3rd decade of the 2nd century.

It was confidently asserted in the late 1800s and so on by many, many, especially German European biblical scholars, that you can't trust the Bible historically, because it was written at least 100 years, the Gospels written at least 100 years later, that the accounts had been circulating for 100 years, then somebody wrote them down, so who knows whether they're really accurate. However, in the middle to latter part of this century, both archaeology and other scholars have proven that the Gospels were all written by 90 AD. Now if you, somebody wants to ask me more questions about that, we can go into it, but a quick example was back, I think in the 30s or the 40s, they discovered a papyrus, a very small fragment of the Gospel of John, like three verses, that's all that they found.

But they found it in Alexandria, Egypt, and they carbon dated it 125 AD at the latest. And so they were able to realize if John, which was the last of all the books of the Gospels written, was in Alexandria by 120 AD, it must have been written by 90 to 100 and therefore the other Gospels were written all within the lifetime of the eyewitnesses, within the lifetime of people who saw Jesus and heard His preaching and were there when all the events happened. Now that, what's interesting is a lot of modern scholars will not admit the implications of this change, but here's what they are.

The essential historical claims of the New Testament, the two in Jesus was empty, authorities couldn't produce the body, many saw the risen Christ, Jesus claimed to be God, Jesus did public miracles, such as feeding the 5,000, healings, raising people from the dead, all that. All of those things were written in public documents. They were circulating around the Mediterranean, the Gospels or the letters of Paul even, and they were all written within the lifetime of hundreds of people who were still alive.

So for example, when Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 15 that hundreds of people saw the risen Christ after He was resurrected, and that most of them are alive, and He writes this in a public document, and Christianity, which was very unpopular as you know, people desperately wanted to wipe it out. And Christianity was completely based on these historical accounts. Hundreds of people were still around.

There is no way in the world, therefore, that these accounts could have been circulating within the lifetime of eyewitnesses of the Ministry of Jesus Christ unless they were corroborated by those witnesses. And you know, there's all sorts of examples you can say, you know, and one example I often use is that even though it was 30 years ago, it would not be that hard. For example, in 1913, there was the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg.

Because when was the Battle of Gettysburg, 1863, 50th anniversary. Do you know how many veterans were still alive, 50 years after that? There were like 20,000 still alive.

It was incredible. They all came together and they talked about things, and could somebody really have written a book within those 50 years that talked about battles or talked about things that happened, that hundreds and thousands of the people on the battlefield had seen within the lifetime of those people. Unless they'd happened, you see?

There must have been corroboration within that time frame. The gospel's written too soon after the events. And so we know that there must have been eyewitnessed corroboration as well.

---

我们有很多佐证。我们仍然有一些历史见证，还有一些我们没有的见证。现在，看，我们仍然有的见证，这里，塔西佗，他是一位罗马历史学家，写于1815年，写道公元64年，尼禄惩罚了基督徒，然后他说，基督在提庇留作皇帝时被执行，由总督本丢彼拉多下令。

有一位撒玛利亚历史学家名叫斯塔拉斯，写于公元52年，写了一部世界历史，他包括了这样一个事实：耶稣被钉十字架的那天也有日食，这是圣经谈到的黑暗。小普林尼，公元112年提到了基督以及他的追随者如何把他当作神来敬拜。约瑟夫是一位历史学家，一位犹太历史学家，他写于公元年间，最近，有些人质疑约瑟夫的历史是否被基督徒修改过，因为他对耶稣说了一些强烈的话。

然而最近我们发现了一些非常古老的文献，一些副本，有一份10世纪用阿拉伯语写的约瑟夫著作副本，在近东某处被挖掘出来，我们很确定这会很接近原件，他这样说。他说，耶稣的门徒报告说，他在被钉十字架三天后向他们显现，并且他还活着。因此，他可能就是先知们讲述奇迹的那位弥赛亚。

所以你把这些人放在一起，在福音书之外，你从其他历史权威那里得到了对福音记载基本轮廓的佐证。耶稣存在，声称是神，他行了神迹，他被钉十字架，他被他的追随者看到身体复活了，这些是基本的。但更有力的佐证是我可能已经提到的，欧洲学术界断言，福音书和使徒行传不是在3世纪之前存在的，是在2世纪的第3个十年。

在19世纪末等时期，许多许多，尤其是德国欧洲圣经学者，自信地断言你不能在历史上信任圣经，因为它是在至少100年后写成的，福音书至少在100年后写成的，这些记述已经流传了100年，然后有人把它们写下来，所以谁知道它们是否真的准确。然而，在本世纪中后期，考古学和其他学者都证明了福音书都是在公元90年之前写成的。现在如果你，有人想要问我更多关于这个的问题，我们可以深入讨论，但一个快速的例子是在，我想是在30年代或40年代，他们发现了一张蒲草纸，约翰福音的一个非常小的碎片，就像三节经文，这就是他们发现的全部。

但他们在埃及亚历山大发现了它，并用碳定年法测定它最晚是公元125年。所以他们能够意识到，如果约翰福音，这是福音书中最后写成的，在公元120年就在亚历山大了，它一定是在公元90到100年之间写成的，因此其他福音书都是在目击者的有生之年内写成的，在那些看到耶稣、听到他讲道、在所有事件发生时在场的人的有生之年内。现在，有趣的是，许多现代学者不会承认这一变化的含义，但这里是它们。

新约的基本历史声称，耶稣的坟墓是空的，当局无法拿出尸体，许多人看到了复活的基督，耶稣声称是神，耶稣行了公开的神迹，如喂饱五千人、医治、使人从死里复活，所有这些。所有这些事情都写在公开的文献中。它们在地中海周围流传，福音书或保罗的书信，它们都是在数百个仍然活着的人的有生之年内写成的。

所以例如，当保罗在哥林多前书15章写道，数百人在耶稣复活后看到了复活的基督，其中大多数人还活着，他在一份公开的文献中写这个，而基督教，如你所知，非常不受欢迎，人们拼命想要消灭它。基督教完全基于这些历史记载。数百人仍然在世。

因此，这些记载绝不可能在耶稣基督事工的目击者的有生之年内流传，除非它们得到了那些见证人的佐证。你知道，有各种各样的例子你可以说，你知道，我经常使用的一个例子是，即使是30年前，也不会那么难。例如，1913年，是葛底斯堡战役的50周年。

葛底斯堡战役是什么时候，1863年，50周年。你知道50年后有多少老兵还活着吗？还有大约两万人活着。

这是不可思议的。他们都聚在一起，谈论事情，有人真的能在那50年内写一本书，谈论战役或谈论发生的事情，而战场上成百上千的人在那些人的有生之年内看到了，除非它们发生了，你明白吗？

在那个时间框架内一定有佐证。福音书写得离事件发生太近了。所以我们知道也一定有目击者的佐证。

## 神迹的问题 / The Problem of Miracles

Over the end, we are now at the end. The problem of miracles, now see where we are, bibliographically, we know we have the originals basically. Number two, the genre, they are historical documents or hoaxes.

Number three, it is extremely unlikely they could have been hoaxes. It's extremely unlikely that they could have been. We see how the corroboration.

So are we ready to admit that these documents are showing us what really happened? And if somebody says, it can't be, why? And the answer is, because people say, because there's miracles in there and therefore it can't be.

Now, if you want to read this next section, and if you want to get into that, I will. But 50 years ago, Newtonian physics reigned in the Western world. And Newtonian physics says there are absolute laws of nature which cannot be violated.

Today, it's quantum theory. And quantum theory says all we know are customary ways in which nature operates. The real problem is this.

If you say miracles can't happen, if the only evidence that a miracle would happen is if somebody wrote an account and said, I saw it and here it is. And if you say miracles can't happen, and you obviate an account of the evidence of a miracle before you even read it, you're arguing in a circle. You're saying miracles cannot happen.

Therefore, miracles have not happened. And that's arguing in a circle. As long as you're willing not to come with a kind of unscientific, anti-logical, dogmatic assertion that if there's miracles in this account, it can't be historical.

You are to this point. If you get rid of that bias, you have to say, this is telling us in a historically reliable way that there was a man named Jesus who claimed the things he claimed and did the things he did. Now, where that brings me is this.

C. S. Lewis years ago said, and he wasn't the first one.

He says, there's only four possible ways to explain Jesus. He was either a legend, a liar, a lunatic, or Lord. Now if you hide behind the idea that he was a legend, if you say, we can't know really what he taught and what he claimed and what he did, then you're able to make up any kind of Jesus you want, right?

You can say, I think he was a flower child, I think he was a revolutionary. You know, I think he was a great teacher. But if he's not a legend, if the gospel of Luke tells you that they're real Jesus, then you are stuck.

Either he was an absolute charlatan, or he was a complete lunatic, or he is who he said he was, but there's no other alternative. And the reason I'm a Christian, one of the main reasons is because as crazy as it is that he actually might be the son of God, it actually makes less sense that either the other two alternatives would be true. And so that's where we are.

Now I've also attached to your handout, a fairly nine point, I'm sorry, it was nine point times Roman, it's pretty hard to read, but if somebody wants me to go into it, I will. The Jesus Seminar is a bunch of radical scholars who in spite of historiographical evidence that the Bible is reliable. They insist that any verse of the Bible is guilty unless it is proven to be true.

If you would go at any other ancient historical document, if you would go through Caesar's Gallic Wars, if you go through any ancient document and say, everything in every page, I consider untrue unless I find some corroborating witness that proves to me it's true. If you would do that, we would know nothing about our past at all, but that's how the Jesus Seminar operates. On that page, I try to show you that if you even take their criteria for deciding which of Jesus' sayings and deeds are authentic, even with their criteria, you can really show that the Bible is an accurate, reliable document.

If somebody wants me to go into that, we will. Now you may not want to get into any of this stuff. You may not want to ask the left brain anything.

You may want to ask Bruce about something that he said tonight or some of the stories that accounts that he made, but at this point, I will take questions. You need to say it loud enough so I can repeat it into the mic because I think we are being taped, and then after that, we will try to answer. We always say the gospel changes everything, and we believe it really does.

That's why here at Gospel and Life, August is Go and Share Month. Throughout August, we are inviting thousands of our listeners to take a small step in sharing the gospel with someone God has placed in your life. For those of you who make a gift to Gospel and Life this month, we will send you two copies of Making Sense of God by Tim Keller.

It's a powerful resource that explores how Christianity makes emotional, cultural, and rational sense in today's world. It's our thanks for your gift, and provides a way you can do a small act to share the gospel by reading the book with a friend giving one to a coworker or passing on both copies to people who are exploring the Christian faith. It's a simple way to start a Gospel conversation or continue it.

To request your two copies of Making Sense of God, simply go to Gospel and Life.com-slash-give. Again, that's Gospel and Life.com-slash-give. Now, here's Dr.

最后，我们现在到了最后。神迹的问题，现在看我们在哪里，从书目上讲，我们知道我们基本上有原件。第二，体裁，它们是历史文献或骗局。

第三，它们极不可能是骗局。它们极不可能是。我们看到佐证如何。

那么我们准备好承认这些文献向我们展示了真正发生的事情吗？如果有人说，不可能，为什么？答案是，因为人们说，因为里面有神迹，因此不可能。

现在，如果你想读下一部分，如果你想深入讨论，我会的。但50年前，牛顿物理学在西方世界占统治地位。牛顿物理学说有不可违反的绝对自然法则。

今天，是量子理论。量子理论说我们所知道的只是自然运作的习惯方式。真正的问题是这个。

如果你说神迹不可能发生，如果神迹发生的唯一证据是有人写了一个记述说，我看到了，这就是。如果你说神迹不可能发生，你在读之前就否定了神迹的证据记述，你是在循环论证。你是在说神迹不可能发生。

因此，神迹没有发生。这是循环论证。只要你愿意不带着那种不科学的、反逻辑的、教条式的断言来，如果这个记述中有神迹，它就不可能是历史的。

你就到了这一点。如果你摆脱那种偏见，你就必须说，这是在以历史上可靠的方式告诉我们，有一个叫耶稣的人，他声称了他所声称的事情，做了他所做的事情。现在，这把我带到了这里。

C.S.路易斯多年前说过，他不是第一个说的人。

他说，只有四种可能的方式来解释耶稣。他要么是传说、骗子、疯子，要么是主。现在如果你躲在他是传说的想法背后，如果你说，我们不能真正知道他教导了什么、声称了什么、做了什么，那么你就能编造任何你想要的耶稣，对吧？

你可以说，我认为他是个嬉皮士，我认为他是个革命者。你知道，我认为他是个伟大的老师。但如果他不是传说，如果路加福音告诉你他们是真实的耶稣，那么你就困住了。

他要么是个绝对的骗子，要么是个完全的疯子，要么他就是他所说的那个人，但没有其他选择。我成为基督徒的原因之一，主要原因之一，是因为尽管他真的可能是神的儿子这件事很疯狂，但实际上其他两个选择是真的更说不通。所以这就是我们所在的地方。

现在我还在你的讲义上附了一个相当九点的，对不起，是九点字号的罗马体，很难读，但如果有人想让我深入讨论，我会的。耶稣研讨会是一群激进的学者，他们不顾历史编纂的证据表明圣经是可靠的。他们坚持圣经的任何一节都是有罪的，除非它被证明是真的。

如果你对待任何其他古代历史文献，如果你浏览凯撒的《高卢战记》，如果你浏览任何古代文献，说每一页的每一件事，我都认为是不真实的，除非我找到一些佐证见证来证明它是真的。如果你那样做，我们对我们的过去将一无所知，但耶稣研讨会就是这样运作的。在那一页上，我试图向你展示，即使采用他们的标准来决定耶稣的哪些言行是真实的，即使用他们的标准，你也真的可以表明圣经是一个准确、可靠的文献。

如果有人想让我深入讨论那个，我们会的。现在你可能不想深入讨论这些东西。你可能不想问左脑任何问题。

你可能想问布鲁斯关于他今晚说的一些事情或他讲的一些故事。但在这一点上，我会接受提问。你需要说得够大声，这样我可以把它重复到麦克风里，因为我想我们正在录音，然后之后，我们会试着回答。我们总是说福音改变一切，我们相信它真的改变。

这就是为什么在这里的"福音与生命"，八月是"去分享月"。整个八月，我们邀请成千上万的听众采取一小步，与神放在你生命中的人分享福音。对于那些本月向"福音与生命"捐赠的人，我们将送你两本提摩太·凯勒的《理解神》。

这是一个强有力的资源，探讨基督教如何在今天的世界中在情感、文化和理性上讲得通。这是对你捐赠的感谢，并提供了一种你可以通过与朋友一起阅读这本书、送一本给同事或把两本都传给正在探索基督教信仰的人来进行一个小小的分享福音行动的方式。这是开始一场福音对话或继续它的简单方法。

要申请你的两本《理解神》，只需访问gospelandlife.com/give。再说一遍，是gospelandlife.com/give。现在，这是凯勒博士

## 公开论坛：问答环节 / Open Forum: Questions and Answers

Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. So let's get started, first hand. That's a good question.

Yeah, but you may not be able to get to them. Are you going to listen? Yeah, I'll tell you what, would you try asking your question at the mic to see if it works since you're on the aisle?

I don't think we can do that for everybody, though. See if it works. Oh, it does.

Okay, ask the question. Okay. Kind of short.

I know. I know. Pull it around.

That way your question is on the tape. Simple question. If we're assuming the New Testament, what you're saying, historical fact, let's assume that with the miracles, part of the basis of that would be that we have to rely also on the Old Testament.

Would that be correct, based on what you're saying? Because if I'm assuming you could correct me if I'm wrong, the New Testament, in his performance of Luke today, is to confirm what was in the Old Testament. Is that correct?

Or am I wrong? I just want to know if I'm right or wrong. Well, simple question.

You mean, are you asking what Bruce's intention was or... No, no, you're saying the New Testament. When you say the Bible, do you mean the New Testament and the Old Testament?

Or are you just talking about the Gospels? Because I think you've made a very persuasive type of point of showing the New Testament may be very valid. Right.

But part of the basis of the New Testament is in the Old Testament and just to mention one thing, if you read Psalm 15, it says, define the Lord, means to walk humble and do the work of the Lord and it does not mention the Son of Man. So my question is, if we assume the New Testament is right, what you're saying, part of the basis is the Old Testament, you know, does it fit in and that means Adam and Eve, that means Noah, that means Abraham, that means Isaac, that means Jacob, are we to you? Do we follow that that also has to be provable like you're doing with this or is it just a New Testament?

No, it's a long question. Great. Have a seat.

Now, if you have a seat, I'll answer that. I don't think that my case for the New Testament documents being reliable proves that the Old Testament documents are reliable. I don't think so.

Well, now I listen. I'll just be, just because I think I can show you that Luke, John, Matthew, Mark are giving us reliable eyewitness accounts of what happened, doesn't mean that because they believe Noah existed, that that means Noah existed, I think all I'm trying to do is give you a case for the fact that Jesus did live the life and said the things he said. Now, I told you in the beginning though, and maybe you're trying to get at this, I was not making a case for the authority of the whole Bible tonight, but if I were, here's how I would do it.

I would say, does the New Testament give us historically reliable picture of Jesus? If so, then we have to decide what to do with Jesus. You have to decide, do I believe what he said he is?

Do I submit to him as Lord? Do I receive him as the Son of God? If you do that, the New Testament shows you what any scholar will tell you, and that is that Jesus believed the Old Testament to be true.

So you've got, there's really three steps to the syllogism. If the Bible is reliable, then Jesus is God, if the New, pardon me, I'm sorry, my syllogism is all up. If the New Testament is historic or reliable, then I can see that Jesus is God.

Now you may not be ready to do that. If you're not ready to do that, then I'm not going to be able to say anything about the Old Testament. But if you believe that Jesus is who he said he is, then I believe in the authority, the rest of the Bible, because Jesus treated it with authority.

But my case for the historical liability of the New Testament is really no case for the historical liability, the Old Testament at all. Now you want to say anything to that, Bruce, you're trying to get at the Old Testament tonight. He does, you do quote the Old Testament where...

I don't know that he quotes it. Yeah. Jesus doesn't occasionally, in parts that you didn't see tonight, he will quote passages from Isaiah, and he will say to people, to fellow Jews, this passage has been fulfilled in your ears, which is like, wait a minute.

Are you saying the reason that was written was so that this happens to you? Who are you saying you are? I mean, he did that a lot, and he talked a lot about the old, the prophecies and that kind of stuff.

And some of them are... Some of them don't work with 20th century reasoning. Some of them are like, you know, some of the things he refers to himself as fulfilling certain prophecies.

You go back and look those up and it's like, wait a minute, are we sure that's talking about Jesus? It doesn't seem to fit. It doesn't seem to, with our sort of rational...

So we got to be careful about taking our culture and going, aha, this doesn't work this way because it's, I mean, Old Testament Hebrew culture, very different from Western Greek thinking even. Yeah. In other words, Jesus did believe that the Old Testament was supernaturally divine, but you have to believe Jesus...

You have to believe in Jesus before I think you can make a case for the divinity of the Old Testament. I think with just using the facts, you can make a good case for the stark reliability of the New Testament. That gets you to Jesus.

But you have to get through Jesus to get to the Old Testament, that's what Bruce is saying there. Okay, Ann, you want to try the mic? Okay.

In light of the discussion we're having and in light of the fact that it is said that there are more Jews in New York City than in Israel. At the end of the presentation, Bruce was talking about the scriptures where Jesus himself was explaining that he was the Messiah. Can you recommend a book that would help the people at Redeemer who have Jewish friends or co-workers to explain that Jesus is the Messiah?

You got one, Bruce. I'm sorry, usually I like it when people sit down after they ask the question, but maybe can you tell them, are you mean you're looking for a book that shows that Jesus fulfills Old Testament prophecy? Or it's a list of prophecies like Isaiah 53, Isaiah 7, Isaiah 9, Psalm 22, Deuteronomy, especially Deuteronomy because a Jewish person, especially an orthodox Jewish person, okay, I just wanted to get the name of it so that people would be aware, especially at this time of year, you run into these conversations in your office with people.

Well Jesus is the Messiah, but I don't quite know how to explain it to you in your own terms. Okay, I know that Josh McDowell's evidence of the man's a verdict does spend a lot of time on how Jesus fulfilled Old Testament prophecies. There's a book by John Guest that I can, it's at the office.

If you call the office and ask for a book by John Guest that has a, I can give you some other things too. Anybody, this is dangerous to say this with so many people, but if you, I could give you a Xerox of a short chapter on how Jesus fulfilled Old Testament prophecies, I know that if you contacted Jews for Jesus, they would have to have all kinds of documents about that. But I think that's what you're looking for.

My point is, can we put it on the book table downstairs so that when we, because I have a lot of Orthodox Jews in my office and they're always talking to me about the Talmud and how the Torah talks about the Talmud, but I don't quite know how to explain the Jesus fulfilled all those prophecies. Okay. Good suggestion.

That's fine. Okay. Somebody else.

I don't know whether you can get to a mic or not. You got a question? Yeah, I see you.

Why don't you, man, come on down, it would help us because this way it gets on the tape. Sorry to make you do that. Maybe I'm only making, I won't make everybody do that if you don't sitting where you can get out.

Go ahead. I don't know if you've heard of Chuck Colson came up with a conspiracy theory argument. He tried to refute the conspiracy argument and he used his life in government and he talked about the benefits of keeping the conspiracy going and the judgment of if the conspiracy is revealed and also he related that to what he believed the apostles were, how they were witnessing and what the benefits and judgments of keeping that so called, if there was a conspiracy going, do you have any, have you read that?

Don't leave that mic yet. I have to get this question a little better focused. Okay.

Chuck Colson talks about a conspiracy theory about the resurrection, you mean? No, he attempted to refute what you're talking about is when he said, when he was involved in Watergate, the top people in the country, the minute self-interest was threatened, the lie fell apart. Yes.

That's the reason he became a Christian was because he looked at what happened and those people's, the disciples' lies were threatened but they died for what? So this couldn't, this wasn't a normal lie if that's what, is that what, is that what you're talking about? Yeah.

Yeah, he was, he was there a question about that that? Yes, I was wondering if Tim had had, had, had heard of this and what his thoughts were on. No, but Bruce had.

Okay. I have. Yes.

Thanks. Thank you. Thanks.

Somebody else? Go ahead. Just, just say it and I'll repeat it.

Well, would you comment on the Apocrypha, why is the Apocrypha not in the Bible? Tim? Wait, now do you mean the Old Testament Apocrypha or the New Testament Apocrypha?

Yeah, okay. Well, yeah, you're, you know, you're bringing up the whole issue of the canon which is a real thorny thing and I hadn't heard of the Chuck Holson conspiracy there. By the way, that is a great, that's a great point.

Did you all hear that? I'm not sure. Bruce understood it.

He understood it. The point was Chuck Holson knows that when, if you're all working together on a hoax, when it looks like people are actually, their heads are going to roll for it, it falls apart. People will not stay true to a lie if it means dying for it.

And he said what, obviously what Holson was doing is when he read the Bible, it's very clear that the whole, the resurrection was either an incredible hoax or reality. And he says when people start dying for the hoax and nobody recants and it doesn't fall apart, that means it wasn't a hoax, okay? So I wanted you to, so I thought that was, I had not heard that, but it was a wonderful argument.

Now, on the canon, the canon refers to the number of books in the Bible that are received as divine inspired books of the Bible. The powerful books are books that were written and were never brought into the canon as part of the Bible. And the way this worked, it wasn't that difficult actually, when the apostles died off and the last of the apostles died, not long after that, the church decided it was very important since you didn't have a living canon, that means when somebody would write something or teach something, as long as you had some of the apostles alive, you always had a way of checking whether or not the teaching was in line with what Jesus had taught.

But when the apostles died, they realized that they no longer had a living straight edge for their lives. No, they needed, so they needed to pull together all the books of the Bible, the New Testament, which were written by an apostle or by an associate of an apostle. So it embodied, either, was apostolic teaching directly or it was apostolic teaching that was, they were part of the apostolic band, so you have Luke, you know, who wasn't an apostle or an eyewitness, but he was Paul's associate.

And so what you have in Luke, in this sense, was Pauline apostolic teaching. And you have Mark, who though he wasn't an apostle, was Peter's associate, and you have Matthew and John and on and on and so on. And what they did was they took the books of the Bible that they understood were written by an apostle or part of the apostolic band, so they knew the apostolic teaching was there.

Any book that purported to be of an apostle, but they decided it was pseudonymous or anonymous, or as one teacher once said, the pseudonymous, while not necessarily synonymous with anonymous, is equally post-alonymous. If they felt that a book was not written by an apostle or it didn't represent apostolic teaching, then they removed it. They said it wasn't, they didn't admit it, I mean.

And they were very careful, not only did they check out the pedigree of the books, but they also checked out whether or not the books had been used by God in the lives of the church, whether or not the Lord really worked through them. And they came up with a cannon pretty soon after the death of the last of the eyewitnesses. And that's how they did it.

Now, the Old Testament cannon was set before Jesus came along at the Council of Jamnia, and it was set earlier. And the reason that we accept the Old Testament cannon is because Jesus did. Again, you know, everything we believe about the Old Testament is really based on Jesus.

Jesus quotes from every book of the Old Testament put Esther. He quotes from, and the apostles who were of course his disciples, quote from the canonical Old Testament that we have today. So basically, Jesus is the reason why apocryl books, both New and Old Testament, aren't part of the Bible.

They had to be written by an apostle or an associate of Jesus, or in the Old Testament, they had to be one that he subscribed to, and that's the reason. Okay, let's go, Seth. Seth is saying that there were times in which he was talking with a friend, a Jewish friend, and making a case that Jesus fulfilled Old Testament prophecies.

He'd pull out an Old Testament prophecy from his Bible, and it didn't match the translation that his friend had in his Bible. And listen, you're not going to overcome that. Here's why, unless you get, well, you can always go to school.

I mean, you can always take a graduate course in Hebrew and Old Testament. It's very normal. If you have, well, I gotta be careful here, it is only natural that the translators try as they may to be objective, tend to be, you know, when they come out of text, translation is always to some degree interpretation.

Translation is never transliteration. You have to interpret. You try very hard to be objective, but the point is you have a point of view.

And interpreters who really don't believe that Jesus is fulfilling prophecies are very often going to translate prophecies away, and they're going to use words that take you away. The Jewish movement, the non-Christian Jewish movement, of Christians, you know, 1990 census indicated that 10% of all Jewish people said they believed in Jesus as the Messiah. Did you know that?

That's been a big hard thing to swallow for a lot of people. But the non-Christian Jewish movement has a vested interest in making sure that those passages, which they've had thrown at them for centuries, are not translated anything like the way the Christian Old Testament is translated. Now I don't mean to say that it's an out and out, you know, twisting, but I'm just telling you that's the issue.

So what you'd have to do yourself is you'd actually have to get a hold of those passages and do some checking out. And if he's an Orthodox Jew, he's going to know Hebrew better than you are. And so when it comes to those passages, I wouldn't argue with him about those.

I would find something else to talk to him about. Okay. No, I would.

I mean, in other words, you're not you're not ready for that. So find other ways to talk. That's all.

Yes, sir. Oh, I thought so. Translation here in the East James and New English and the Jerusalem Bible.

But they're right in a row and you've been looked from passage to passage to passage. And to answer that question about the Translation. Yeah.

The question is if you compare translations, even though you don't know Hebrew or Greek, doesn't that help you? And the answer is yes, but it still doesn't completely overcome the problem. I was going to ask Bruce a question.

I love the fact that you use the King James. It was that straight King James, or did you do some some rendering of it yourself? What translation did you use?

Thanks, Tim. No, it was mostly King James. There were some passages from John, from the new new revised standard.

And there are occasional, there are some words, some 15th century words like yeah, yeah, like that one. And that I don't know the meaning of. And I thought, hmm, I think I'll use a new translation.

But there's only like 20 or 30 words in the hour and a half that I've changed. It's mostly King James. Why did you use, why did you use the King James version?

I use the King James version because my boss told me I had to. Who's that? His name is John Jury.

He's the artistic director of actor, theater, Louisville. This was a regular equity. Actor, theater, Louisville is a major regional theater, completely non-Christian.

Take my word for it. And this was done on Broadway. And like I said in the introduction, it was his Easter offering.

But do you see the advantages of using the King James? Well, you know, King James was written to be spoken as a pulpit version because so many people were illiterate. And it's the same thing as Shakespeare.

You know, boy, I'm an actor and I've done a fair amount of Shakespeare. And it's difficult to read because it was written to be spoken and to be. And these, actually, if you think about it, these were eyewitness accounts.

So originally, Luke, the historian, got these as spoken testimony, probably. And he probably had other sources. But eyewitness accounts.

So originally, people were telling these to people. And you can imagine the guy who said, I came into a city called Maine. And Jesus was in a lot of his disciples.

His dead body was being taken out. Jesus said a couple of words of the dead body. It sat up.

It started talking. He delivered him onto his mother and there came a fear upon. You can imagine the way Jesus, the way that original eyewitness told that to Luke, was not, it came to pass in those days that he came off onto the city of Maine.

You know, it's been badly read in church for 300 years. And people, I did it. There was a student doing a review of the show down in Florida.

And he said, I want to I want to show you what I wrote, Bruce. And he said, Bruce Cune takes otherwise boring material. And it's like, wait a minute.

This is not boring material. I mean, withered hands become whole. This is dead bodies.

This is, right. It's been made maybe a little too sacred. And it is that.

But yes, I'm going to take a couple more questions, but I want you know, I loved him using the King James. First of all, it is gorgeous. But secondly, the King James really probably makes more sense when it's early interpreted.

Not just red, but I mean, early interpreted. It made so much more sense in the way I, the way it makes the way it looks when you actually read it to yourself. I just absolutely loved it.

Now I can take a couple more questions. And it is the way Jesus himself spoke. Right.

As somebody once said about the King James Bible, if it was good enough for St. Paul, it was good enough for me. That's right.

Yeah, go ahead. I'm going to take a couple more. We have to be done by 8.15.

So if you can stay around for 10 more minutes, I'll, I'm sending everybody away by then. Yes, go ahead. For the tape, someone just complimented Bruce Cune.

Said it was a fantastic performance just so just for the record now. And I'm going to make my questions with those three statements that I have to make. And I'll give you the question up front.

How truthful is Jesus existence? That's where I'll line up with the following statement. How truthful is Jesus existence?

Okay. Why are the books of the New Testament different in four men from the books of the Old Testament? And if we can both believe that God wrote the Old Testament through Moses, then why would he have changed his four men in the Old Testament?

Therefore, I can see that Jesus existence. Okay. The question is, the New Testament is written in very different form than the Old Testament.

If God wrote the Old and the New Testament, why would it be so different? Okay. And the answer is, Jesus, just as Jesus was fully human and fully divine, He wasn't half human, half divine, He was 100 percent, 100 percent.

The Bible is not only divine book, it's a human book. It's not only human book, it's a divine book. To say it's really human, that the people who wrote it were writing it consciously.

They were using their own personalities and their own cultural forms to write it. Does not compromise the fact that it was all, everything that was written was written by God, and every word was the word that God wanted to be written. So you can put those two things together.

To say that since God wrote the whole Bible, the same literary form or personality would be evident throughout, isn't right. The themes are there. The truth all coheres.

But the fact is that, for example, Luke says to his, the person he's writing to, theophilus, he says, I wrote this account because I thought it would be good. Luke did not, here's what I'm trying to say, Luke did not one day was sitting, you know, just to have all of a sudden his hands started to move. He says, I'm, and he picked up a pen, and he says, my gosh, what's going on here?

And he all became an, you know, it was an automatic writing. His personality, his foibles even, his, his culture was all reflected. And that's the reason why you have such that you have, he brews the Greek of Hebrews is so lofty and the Greek of John is almost like talking to a little kid.

And because the, that's what's so wonderful about the Bible, it is an absolutely human book. And yet, it is absolutely thoroughly divine. So it's not the, it's not the form, but the content and the coherence that shows it's divine, but not the form.

和今天教导的剩余部分。那么让我们开始吧，第一只手。这是个好问题。

是的，但你可能无法接近他们。你会听吗？是的，我告诉你什么，你能试着在麦克风前问你的问题，看看它是否工作，因为你在过道上？

我不认为我们能为每个人都这样做。看看它是否工作。哦，可以。

好的，问问题。好的。有点短。

我知道。我知道。把它转过来。

这样你的问题就在录音带上了。简单的问题。如果我们假设新约，你说的，是历史事实，让我们假设，包括神迹，这部分基础是我们也必须依靠旧约。

那是对的吗，基于你所说的？因为如果我假设你可以纠正我如果我错了，新约，在今天路加的演出中，是为了确认旧约中的内容。那是对的吗？

或者我错了吗？我只是想知道我对还是错。嗯，简单的问题。

你是说，你在问布鲁斯的意图是什么还是...不，不，你说的是新约。当你说圣经时，你是指新约和旧约吗？

或者你只是在谈论福音书？因为我认为你已经做出了一个非常有说服力的论点，表明新约可能是非常有效的。对。

但新约的部分基础在旧约中，只是提一件事，如果你读诗篇15篇，它说，定义主，意思是谦卑地行走，做主的工作，它没有提到人子。所以我的问题是，如果我们假设新约是对的，你所说的，部分基础是旧约，你知道，它符合吗，这意味着亚当和夏娃，这意味着挪亚，这意味着亚伯拉罕，这意味着以撒，这意味着雅各，我们要吗？我们是否遵循这也必须像你对这个所做的那样可证明，还是只是新约？

不，这是个长问题。很好。请坐。

现在，如果你坐下，我会回答。我不认为我对新约文献是可靠的论证证明了旧约文献是可靠的。我不这么认为。

嗯，现在我听着。我只是，只是因为我认为我可以向你展示路加、约翰、马太、马可给了我们可靠的目击者对所发生事情的记述，并不意味着因为他们相信挪亚存在，就意味着挪亚存在，我认为我所做的只是给你一个论证，证明耶稣确实活过那样的生活，说过他所说的话。现在，我在开始时告诉过你，也许你试图谈到这个，我今晚不是在为整本圣经的权威性辩护，但如果我要辩护，我会这样做。

我会说，新约是否给了我们耶稣的历史上可靠的画面？如果是这样，那么我们必须决定如何对待耶稣。你必须决定，我是否相信他所说的他是谁？

我是否顺服他为主？我是否接受他为神的儿子？如果你这样做，新约向你展示了任何学者都会告诉你的，那就是耶稣相信旧约是真实的。

所以你有，三段论真的有三个步骤。如果圣经是可靠的，那么耶稣是神，如果新，对不起，对不起，我的三段论全乱了。如果新约在历史上是可靠的，那么我可以看到耶稣是神。

现在你可能还没有准备好这样做。如果你还没有准备好这样做，那么我将无法说任何关于旧约的事情。但如果你相信耶稣是他所说的那个人，那么我相信圣经其余部分的权威性，因为耶稣以权威对待它。

但我对新约历史可靠性的论证真的完全不是对旧约历史可靠性的论证。现在你想对此说点什么吗，布鲁斯，你试图在今晚谈到旧约。他确实，你确实引用了旧约，在...

我不知道他是否引用它。是的。耶稣偶尔会，在你今晚没有看到的部分，他会引用以赛亚书的段落，他会对人说，对犹太同胞说，这段经文已经在你们耳边应验了，这就像，等一下。

你是说写那个的原因是为了让这发生在你身上？你说你是谁？我是说，他经常这样做，他大量谈论旧的、预言和那类东西。

有些是...有些用20世纪的推理行不通。有些是像，你知道，他指自己应验某些预言的一些事情。

你回去查那些，就像，等一下，我们确定那是在谈论耶稣吗？似乎不符合。似乎不，用我们那种理性的...

所以我们必须小心，不要拿着我们的文化说，啊哈，这不是这样工作的，因为它是，我是说，旧约希伯来文化，与西方希腊思维非常不同。是的。换句话说，耶稣确实相信旧约是超自然神圣的，但你必须相信耶稣...

你必须相信耶稣，然后我认为你才能为旧约的神性辩护。我认为仅仅使用事实，你可以为新约的可靠性做出很好的论证。那会把你带到耶稣。

但你必须通过耶稣才能到达旧约，这就是布鲁斯在那里说的。好的，安，你想试试麦克风吗？好的。

鉴于我们正在进行的讨论，鉴于据说纽约市的犹太人比以色列的还多这一事实。在演出结束时，布鲁斯谈到了耶稣自己解释他是弥赛亚的经文。你能推荐一本书，可以帮助救赎主教会中有犹太朋友或同事的人解释耶稣是弥赛亚吗？

你有吗，布鲁斯。对不起，通常我喜欢人们在提问后坐下，但也许你能告诉他们，你是说你在寻找一本书，表明耶稣应验了旧约预言吗？或者是像以赛亚书53章、以赛亚书7章、以赛亚书9章、诗篇22篇、申命记这样的预言列表，特别是申命记，因为一个犹太人，特别是一个正统犹太人，好的，我只是想得到它的名字，这样人们就会知道，特别是在每年的这个时候，你在办公室里遇到与人的这些对话。

嗯，耶稣是弥赛亚，但我不太知道如何用你自己的术语向你解释。好的，我知道乔希·麦克道威尔的《铁证待判》确实花了很多时间讨论耶稣如何应验旧约预言。有一本约翰·盖斯特的书，我可以，它在办公室。

如果你给办公室打电话，要一本约翰·盖斯特的书，我可以给你一些其他的东西。有人，对这么多人说这个是危险的，但如果你，我可以给你一章关于耶稣如何应验旧约预言的复印件，我知道如果你联系"犹太人归主"组织，他们必须有各种关于这的文献。但我认为这就是你在寻找的。

我的意思是，我们能把它放在楼下的书桌上吗，这样当我们，因为我办公室里有很多正统犹太人，他们总是和我谈论塔木德以及托拉如何谈论塔木德，但我不太知道如何解释耶稣应验了所有那些预言。好的。好建议。

很好。好的。其他人。

我不知道你能不能到麦克风那里。你有问题吗？是的，我看到你了。

为什么你不，伙计，下来吧，这会帮助我们，因为这样它就能录到录音带上。对不起让你这样做。也许我不会让每个人都这样做，如果你坐在不能出来的地方。

请讲。我不知道你是否听说过查克·科尔森提出了一个阴谋论论证。他试图反驳阴谋论证，他用了他在政府的生活经历，他谈到了维持阴谋的好处以及如果阴谋被揭露的审判，他还把那与他所相信的使徒们的见证联系起来，如果有阴谋的话，维持所谓的阴谋的好处和审判，你有任何，你读过吗？

不要离开那个麦克风。我需要把这个问题更好地聚焦一下。好的。

查克·科尔森谈论关于复活的阴谋论，你是说？不，他试图反驳的是，当他参与水门事件时，国家的高层人物，一旦自我利益受到威胁，谎言就崩溃了。是的。

这就是他成为基督徒的原因，是因为他看着发生的事情和那些人，门徒的谎言受到威胁，但他们为什么而死？所以这不可能，如果那是什么，那是你在谈论的吗，这不是一个正常的谎言？是的。

是的，他是，有关于那的问题吗？是的，我想知道提姆是否听说过这个，他的想法是什么。没有，但布鲁斯听说过。

好的。我听说过。是的。

谢谢。谢谢。

其他人？请讲。只是，只是说出来，我会重复它。

嗯，你能评论一下次经吗，为什么次经不在圣经中？提姆？等等，现在你是指旧约次经还是新约次经？

是的，好的。嗯，是的，你知道，你提出了整个正典问题，这是一个非常棘手的事情，我没有听说过查克·科尔森的阴谋论。顺便说一句，那是一个很好的，那是一个很好的论点。

你们都听到了吗？我不确定。布鲁斯理解了。

他理解了。关键是查克·科尔森知道，如果你们都在一起搞骗局，当看起来人们真的要为此掉脑袋时，它就会崩溃。人们不会为一个谎言保持真实，如果这意味着为它而死。

他说什么，显然科尔森所做的是当他读圣经时，非常清楚的是，复活要么是一个令人难以置信的骗局，要么是现实。他说，当人们开始为骗局而死，没有人撤回，它没有崩溃，这意味着它不是骗局，好吗？所以我想让你，所以我认为那是，我没有听说过，但那是一个很好的论证。

现在，关于正典，正典指的是圣经中被接受为神圣默示的书卷的数量。次经书卷是被写成但从未被纳入圣经正典的书卷。这是如何运作的，实际上并不那么困难，当使徒们去世，最后一个使徒去世时，不久之后，教会决定这非常重要，因为你没有活的正典，这意味着当有人写什么或教什么时，只要你还有一些使徒活着，你总是有办法检查教导是否符合耶稣所教导的。

但当使徒们去世时，他们意识到他们不再有一个活的直尺来衡量他们的生活。不，他们需要，所以他们需要把圣经的所有书卷，新约，由使徒或使徒的同工写的，聚集在一起。所以它体现了，要么是直接的使徒教导，要么是，他们是使徒团队的一部分，所以你有路加，你知道，他不是使徒或目击者，但他是保罗的同工。

所以在这个意义上，你在路加中所拥有的，是保罗使徒教导。你有马可，虽然他不是使徒，但他是彼得的同工，你有马太和约翰等等。他们所做的是他们拿了圣经的书卷，他们理解是由使徒写的或使徒团队的一部分，所以他们知道使徒教导在那里。

任何声称是使徒所写的书，但他们判定是冒名的或匿名的，或者如一位老师曾经说的，冒名的，虽然不一定与匿名同义，但同样是后匿名的。如果他们觉得一本书不是由使徒写的，或者它不代表使徒教导，那么他们就移除它。他们说它不是，我是说他们不接纳它。

他们非常仔细，他们不仅检查了书卷的血统，而且还检查了神是否在教会的生活中通过它们工作，主是否真的通过它们工作。他们在最后一个目击者去世后不久就形成了一个正典。这就是他们如何做的。

现在，旧约正典是在耶稣来之前在雅麦尼亚会议上确定的，它更早就确定了。我们接受旧约正典的原因是因为耶稣接受了它。再说一遍，你知道，我们对旧约所相信的一切真的是基于耶稣。

耶稣引用了旧约的每一卷书，除了以斯帖记。他引用了，而使徒们当然是他的门徒，引用了我们今天所拥有的正典旧约。所以基本上，耶稣是次经书卷，无论新约还是旧约，不是圣经一部分的原因。

它们必须由使徒或耶稣的同工写成，或者在旧约中，它们必须是他认可的，这就是原因。好的，我们继续，塞思。塞思说有几次他在与一个朋友，一个犹太朋友交谈，并论证耶稣应验了旧约预言。

他会从他的圣经中拿出一个旧约预言，它与他朋友圣经中的翻译不匹配。听着，你无法克服那个。这是为什么，除非你得到，嗯，你总是可以去上学。

我是说，你总是可以上一门希伯来语和旧约的研究生课程。这是非常正常的。如果你有，嗯，我得小心这里，译者尽管努力尝试客观，往往会，你知道，当他们从文本中出来时，翻译总是在某种程度上是解释，这是很自然的。

翻译从来不是音译。你必须解释。你非常努力地客观，但关键是你有一个观点。

那些真的不相信耶稣应验预言的译者，往往会把预言翻译掉，他们会使用让你离开的词语。犹太运动，非基督徒犹太运动，基督徒中，你知道，1990年人口普查表明，所有犹太人中有10%说他们相信耶稣是弥赛亚。你知道吗？

对很多人来说，这一直是一件很难接受的事情。但非基督徒犹太运动有既得利益确保那些段落，那些几个世纪以来一直被扔给他们的段落，不会以任何接近基督徒旧约翻译的方式翻译。现在我不是说这是彻头彻尾的，你知道，扭曲，但我只是告诉你这就是问题。

所以你自己必须做的是，你实际上必须得到那些段落并做一些核实。如果他是正统犹太人，他会比你更懂希伯来语。所以当涉及到那些段落时，我不会和他争论那些。

我会找其他的事情和他谈。好的。不，我会的。

我是说，换句话说，你还没有准备好。所以找其他方式来谈。就这样。

是的，先生。哦，我是这么想的。这里的翻译，钦定本、新英语本和耶路撒冷圣经。

但它们排成一排，你可以从一段到另一段查看。回答那个关于翻译的问题。是的。

问题是，如果你比较翻译，即使你不懂希伯来语或希腊语，这不是有帮助吗？答案是肯定的，但它仍然不能完全克服问题。我要问布鲁斯一个问题。

我喜欢你使用钦定本的事实。那是纯粹的钦定本，还是你自己做了一些修改？你用的是什么翻译？

谢谢，提姆。不，主要是钦定本。约翰有一些段落，是从新修订标准本来的。

有偶尔的，有一些词，一些15世纪的词，像那样。我不知道意思。我想，嗯，我想我会用一个新的翻译。

但在一个半小时里我只改了大约20或30个词。主要是钦定本。你为什么用，你为什么用钦定本？

我用钦定本是因为我的老板告诉我必须用。那是谁？他的名字叫约翰·茹利。

他是路易斯维尔演员剧院的艺术总监。这是一个常规的股权。路易斯维尔演员剧院是一个主要的地区剧院，完全非基督教。

相信我的话。这是在百老汇上演的。就像我在介绍中说的，这是他的复活节献礼。

但你看到使用钦定本的好处了吗？嗯，你知道，钦定本是为了作为讲坛版本被朗读而写的，因为那么多人是文盲。这和莎士比亚一样。

你知道，天哪，我是个演员，我演过相当多的莎士比亚。阅读很困难，因为它是为了被朗读和被。这些，实际上，如果你想想，这些是目击者的记述。

所以最初，路加，这位历史学家，很可能是通过口述见证得到这些的。他可能还有其他来源。但目击者记述。

所以最初，人们是在告诉这些给人们。你可以想象那个说的人，我来到一个叫奈因的城市。耶稣在那里，他的很多门徒也在。

一具死尸正被抬出去。耶稣对死尸说了几句话。它坐了起来。

它开始说话。他把他交给了他的母亲，众人都惧怕。你可以想象那个最初的目击者告诉路加的方式，不是，当时，他来到奈因城。

你知道，这在教会里被糟糕地朗读了300年。人们，我这样做了。有一个学生在佛罗里达做演出评论。

他说，我想让你看看我写的，布鲁斯。他说，布鲁斯·库恩将原本枯燥的材料。就像，等一下。

这不是枯燥的材料。我是说，枯萎的手变完全。这是死尸。

对。它可能被弄得有点太神圣了。它是那样的。

但是是的，我要再回答几个问题，但我想让你知道，我喜欢他使用钦定本。首先，它很华美。但其次，钦定本在被演绎时真的可能更有意义。

不只是朗读，而是，我是说，演绎。当你实际读给自己听时，它看起来的样子，它更有意义。我绝对喜欢它。

现在我可以再回答几个问题。这就是耶稣自己说话的方式。对。

正如有人曾经说过关于钦定本圣经的，如果它对圣保罗来说足够好，对我来说就足够好。没错。

是的，请讲。我要再回答几个。我们必须在8点15分结束。

所以如果你能再待10分钟，我，我会在那时让每个人都离开。是的，请讲。为了录音，有人刚刚称赞了布鲁斯·库恩。

说这是一场奇妙的演出，只是为了记录。我要用那三个陈述来提我的问题。我会先给你问题。

耶稣的存在有多真实？这就是我要排列的后续陈述。耶稣的存在有多真实？

好的。为什么新约的书卷在四个人中与旧约的书卷不同？如果我们都能相信神通过摩西写了旧约，那么他为什么会在旧约中改变他的四个人？

因此，我可以看到耶稣的存在。好的。问题是，新约的写作形式与旧约非常不同。

如果神写了旧约和新约，为什么会如此不同？好的。答案是，耶稣，就像耶稣是完全的人和完全的神，他不是半人半神，他是100%，100%。

圣经不仅是神圣的书，它是人的书。它不仅是人的书，它是神圣的书。说它真的是人的，写它的人是有意识地写的。

他们使用自己的个性和自己的文化形式来写它。这并不损害这样一个事实：所有写的东西都是由神写的，每一个词都是神想要被写下来的词。所以你可以把这两件事放在一起。

说既然神写了整本圣经，同样的文学形式或个性会在整本书中显而易见，这是不对的。主题在那里。真理都是一致的。

但事实是，例如，路加对他写给的人，提阿非罗，他说，我写这个记述是因为我认为这会是好的。路加没有，我想说的是，路加没有有一天坐着，你知道，突然他的手开始移动。他说，我，他拿起一支笔，他说，天哪，这是怎么回事？

他全都变成了，你知道，这是自动书写。他的个性，甚至他的小缺点，他的，他的文化都反映在里面。这就是为什么你有这样的，你有，希伯来书的希腊语如此崇高，约翰的希腊语几乎像在和小孩说话。

因为，这就是圣经如此美妙的原因，它是一本绝对的人的书。然而，它是绝对完全神圣的。所以不是形式，而是内容和一致性显示它是神圣的，但不是形式。
