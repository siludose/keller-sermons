## 日光之下的生活 / Life Under the Sun

Welcome to Gospel and Life. When someone you know is contemplating life's deepest questions, who am I? What's wrong with the world?

What can truly make me whole? Jesus doesn't just give us answers. He gives us Himself.

In this month's podcast, Tim Keller looks at how we can share the hope we have in Christ as the answer to a person's search for meaning and purpose. As you may know, August is Goen's share month at Gospel and Life, and we've curated a wide range of free resources to help you take simple steps to share the Gospel with someone God has put in your life. You can access these resources at gospelandlife.com slash share.

We believe God uses small acts to do great things, and we're inviting you to do simple, small acts to go and share the Gospel this month, because the Gospel changes everything. Today's Scripture reading is from the book of Ecclesiastes, chapter 2 verses 9 through 26. I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me.

In all this, my wisdom stayed with me. I denied myself nothing my eyes desired. I refused my heart, no pleasure.

My heart took delight in all my labor, and this was the reward for all my toil. And when I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toil to achieve, everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind. Nothing was gained under the sun.

Then I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom, and also madness and folly. What more can the King's successor do than what has already been done? I saw that wisdom is better than folly, just as light is better than darkness.

The wise have eyes in their heads while the fool walks in the darkness, but I came to realize that the same fate overtakes them both. Then I said to myself, the fate of the fool will overtake me also. What then do I gain by being wise?

I said to myself, this too is meaningless. For the wise, like the fool, will not be long remembered, the days have already come when both have been forgotten. Like the fool, the wise too must die.

So I hated life because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind. I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun because I must leave them to the one who comes after me.

And who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish. Yet they will have control over all the fruit of my toil into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless.

So my heart began to despair over all my toil some labor under the sun. For a person may labor with wisdom, knowledge, and skill, and then they must leave all they own to another who is not toiled for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune.

What do people get for all the toil and anxious striving with which they labor under the sun? All their days they work is grief and pain, even at night their minds do not rest. This too is meaningless.

A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil. This too, I see, is from the hand of God, for without him who can eat or find enjoyment. To the person who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and happiness, but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God.

This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind. The word of the Lord. Thanks be to God.

Did you know that Herman Melville in Moby Dick, chapter 96, said that Ecclesiastes is the truest book in the world. You knew that, of course, and you knew a chapter, right? Ecclesiastes, which you just heard read, is really at least one of the most confusing books in the world.

Certainly, the first time through, because it depicts a very, very, very disillusioned man. In fact, the very beginning of Ecclesiastes in the very first verses, this is what the author says, meaningless, meaningless, utterly meaningless, everything is meaningless. And then, of course, that was wonderfully inspiring words there in verse 17 that we read.

And so I hated life, because everything that was done under the sun was grievous to me and meaningless. Now, the reason it's confusing as you're looking at this and you're saying is the Bible really saying that all human life is pointless. And to understand what's going on here, you need to keep two things in mind.

The first is that the author is a person who, in verse 1 of chapter 1, in the very beginning of the book of Ecclesiastes. Verse 1, chapter 1, the author is named, is called the Cohelleth. It's a Hebrew word that's actually pretty hard to translate, but many people would say, it means the professor.

And those of you who've been a good graduate seminars know that a professor in a graduate seminar doesn't preach and doesn't even lecture usually, but goes you with questions, tries to get you to think it out for yourself. The other thing that's important to recognize is this little term, in fact, you can see it in the beginning of chapter in the very beginning of the reading here. It says, I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me and all this my wisdom stayed with me.

Over and over again, the author says, so I live for pleasure, but my wisdom stayed with me. And then I achieved more things in Jerusalem than anyone before me and all this my wisdom stayed with me, which sounds a little strange, but it's actually in a side and here's what he's doing. It's an ancient way of saying, this is a thought experiment.

I am imagining I'm in this situation, you know, if I ask you to do a thought experiment, I'm usually saying, imagine this and imagine this and this is the condition, and I put yourself in this situation, what would you think? That's what he's doing. And every so often he says, my wisdom stayed with me, which is a way of saying, now look, I'm looking at this and I'm trying to figure out what it teaches us.

It's a little bit like an actor who comes up on stage and begins to act a role, and then every so often comes over on the side and says to the, speaks to the audience is, now here's what we can learn about this and here's what we can learn about this. And actually, that's the secret to understanding the book of Ecclesiastes. It's a set of thought experiments in which the professor is saying, so let's imagine living like this and let's imagine living like this, and what do we see, and what does that mean?

And does that work? And all the time my wisdom stays with me is a way of saying, well, yeah, I mean obviously I'm doing this as a thought experiment, I'm still myself. So I started to live for this, but I was looking at myself, got it?

And therefore, if you want to understand what Ecclesiastes is after, we need to look at these thought experiments and let me show you a long thought experiment and the main lesson. And then in here, the passage we've read, there's a short thought experiment and an arrow. Okay, a main thought, there's a major thought experiment with a lesson and there's a small thought experiment at the very end and then an arrow or a pointer.

With me, let's go. First of all, the main one, the big one. The big thought experiment is how to look at life under the sun.

Do you see, there's 30 times in the book of Ecclesiastes, it uses the term under the sun. And you'll notice that what he says is not that life is meaningless. He says life is meaningless under the sun.

So it says in verse, you know, it says in verse 11, nothing was gained under the sun. Everything was meaningless under the sun and you see that's the verse 11, it's also verse 17, 20, 22 and it actually happens 30 times in the book. Now, what does that mean?

Commentators and scholars will say that when he says, I looked at life under the sun, what he meant is I considered life here on earth without regard to eternity or God. Let's make believe, for a moment, that this life is all there is. That's what he's doing.

Now, this is what's called a secular mindset and you have to be careful here. To be a secular person doesn't mean to be an atheist. Certainly, Ecclesiastes, the author here wouldn't have known any atheists, they didn't exist back then.

And even today, even though we live in a largely, basically a secular culture, there's not that many, there's not a very large percentage of people who are actually atheists. But Charles Taylor, Canadian philosopher who wrote a book recently, a big book that everyone thinks is important on secularism, on a secular age, he says, to be secular is not that you don't believe in God or in afterlife. It's to say, but nobody can know if there's a God, nobody can know if there's an afterlife.

And therefore, this world, by the way, the word secular comes from the Latin word secule which means the present. Basically what a secular mindset is says, well, there may be a God, maybe not. There may be an afterlife, maybe not.

But all we can know is this world and this life, time and space. And therefore, a secular person says, well, there may be a God or not, but we have to find our comfort here, we have to find our happiness here, we have to find our meaning right here in this life. This is life under the sun.

So basically, this major thought experiment, which is a big part of what the book of Ecclesiastes is about, is essentially saying this, the author is saying, okay, deal. I am going to look at life as if this life is all that we can know. And then I'm going to base my life only on things that can be had here and now.

And then I'm going to ask on its own terms is such a life meaningful. On its own terms, is it satisfying? And that's what he does.

And he does this experiment looking at life under the sun in three ways. What does it mean to live as if this life is all there is? Well, one way to do it is what we can call here, the pleasure project.

In verses 1 to 11, it comes down to 1 to 11, he imagines that he is living with all the sensual pleasure you want, sensual pleasure by that, I mean the pleasure of the senses. And so in verses 1 to 11, even though they're not printed here in chapter 2, he talks about he has a harem, there's sex, he's got food, he's got houses, he's got servants, he has every sensual pleasure, every pleasure of the senses, and he summarizes it in verse 10 here at the top where he says, I denied myself nothing, my eyes desired. I refused my heart, no pleasure, so he lived for pleasure, okay?

What happened? He tells you, verse 11, but when I surveyed everything, everything was meaningless, chasing after the wind, nothing was gained under the sun. By the way, that term, chasing after the wind is so perfect to talk about what it means to live a life of pleasure.

When you live for pleasure, it's like chasing after the wind, how so? Well the wind is something you can feel, can't you? You certainly can feel the wind, but try to grab it, actually try to get ahead of it or try to get a hold of it, you can't.

And so pleasure is like that, actually. All pleasure is like that, when you live for pleasure, you find that yes, it feels good and yet it fades even as you're grasping hold of it. Years ago, I think I'll actually read you this, years ago there was a woman who lived in New York and she wrote for the village voice, her name was Cynthia Heimel, H-E-I-M-E-L.

And later she moved out to L-A and she wrote not for the village voice, but for Playboy. She was a very ascetic writer and she wrote a column in the village voice in 1989, the year I moved here. And in it, she talked about, I guess she was very ascetic, but she was right on.

She had known at that point a number of people who had been working as bouncers in nightclubs and, you know, hat check girls and things like that and had become famous. She actually named two or three people that she knew that had become big movie stars. She named them and she knew her, this big movie star when she worked behind the cosmetic counter at Macy's.

And she knew him, there was another big movie star when he, you know, worked at a movie theater just, you know, punching tickets and things like that. And now they were famous. And here's what she said, in every case she either still knew them or she knew people who knew them.

In every case, they were more unhappy than they'd been before they were successful. They were more angry. They were more anxious.

And actually, you know, kind of cynically, she wrote this, this is from the clipping. She says that giant thing that they were striving for, that fame thing that was going to make everything okay, that was going to make their lives bearable, that was going to fill them with happiness had happened, and they were still them. And disillusionment turned them howling and insufferable.

And so that's exactly the same thing that the co-hell of the saying. He says, you know, when you live for pleasure, it just doesn't work. It just simply doesn't.

It's like a chasing after the wind. On its own terms, pleasure, a living for pleasure isn't pleasurable, and everybody who lives for it says so. Okay, what else could you do in order to live for, is if this world is all there is.

The other thing you could do is live for, you see, he turns, notice, and he says, in verse 12, then I turn my thoughts to consider wisdom. So he turns away from the pleasure, and he tries wisdom. I turn my thoughts to wisdom and madness and folly.

What more can the King's successor do that has been done? I saw that wisdom is better than folly, as light is better than darkness, the wise of eyes in their head while the fools walk in darkness. Now what is he talking about?

What does it mean to live for wisdom? Well, probably, since as part of this thought experiment of life under the sun, by wisdom here, he's really thinking of philosophy. Philosophy, by definition, ever since the Greeks and ascents invented philosophy, philosophy is trying to use human reason to figure out the meaning of life and how you should live, without recourse to religion.

Not that there aren't religious philosophers, but by and large, the whole idea of philosophy is you use reason, and with reason you are seeking the meaning of life and how human beings should live without recourse to religion and God and things like that. The Greeks, of course, were the first and maybe the best, and they had all sorts of ways of trying to figure out the meaning of life and what was behind the universe and what were the moral assets behind the universe so that if we conformed to them, then we would be living along the grain of the universe and we would be living full lives and wise lives. The philosopher's whole job was to say, what is the right way to live and what is the wise way to live and what is the way of living that fits in with the reality of things and the grain of things?

So he said he got into that. He started to live for learning and scholarship and wisdom, but look, what happened? Oh, this is amazing, I think.

This is part of one of the great things about this book. He says, but I came to realize this is verse 14, that the same fate overtakes them both who, the wise and the fool. The person who's working like crazy to be wise, the philosopher who's trying to think it out.

What is the meaning of life? How should people live? What is right and wrong?

What is the meaning of justice? How do we define justice? You're thinking and thinking and thinking and trying to make this world a better place and what does it say?

And then I said to myself, the fate of the fool will overtake me also. What then do I gain by being wise? This too is meaningless.

For the wise, like the fool, have both been forgotten. Like the fool, the wise will die. Now this is extremely interesting.

And in the history of philosophy, actually, if you get down to Jean Paul Sartre and Kirchegard and Albeir Camus and people like that, this is really what they said. And that is, if this life is all there is and when you die, you rot. And when the sun goes out, the whole civilization dies and there's no one even around to remember anything that you've ever done.

You know what that means? That means it doesn't matter how you live, it doesn't matter whether you're a nice person or a nasty person. It doesn't matter whether you're a philanthropist or a serial killer, the product's the same.

Think about this. If this life is all there is, then human civilization, what if human civilization lasted a million years? I don't think it will, or two million years, or a billion years, okay.

Nevertheless, in comparison to the oceans of dead time that happened before, the universe kind of came together and the earth came together and life began to grow up on the planet. And the oceans of dead time after the sun burns out and all civilization goes away. Even a human civilization lasts a billion years.

In comparison to the oceans of dead time before and afterwards, that's like a flick, it's just like a second, it's just like a blip. And everything that's ever been done, nobody will be around to remember it, everybody will be forgotten. And what that means is nothing you do matters, nothing you do makes any difference, nothing you do has any significance, final at all, you say, well, but it does because it makes the world a better place for how long?

See if this life is all there is, everything you do is insignificant, all philosophy is insignificant. There's no difference between living a wise or a good life or a foolish or a bad life. And that's not all.

Finally, he applies, he thinks about, okay, what about work? The cohella says, well, what if I was living for achievement? What if I was living for not pleasure and not wisdom and brilliance and insight, but achievement?

Just hard work. Well, of course, the same thing happens, and you can see it in verse 17. So I hated life because all the work that is done, under the sun, if this life is all there is, under the sun, all the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me.

It's all meaningless to chasing after the wind. Why? Well, he gives two reasons and there's something.

He says, first of all, he says, I hated all things I had toiled for under the sun because I must leave him to one who comes after me and who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish. Now, by the way, I want you to take that seriously. In fact, let me push you on this.

He's absolutely right. You know all the people. This is an absolute fact.

There's no doubt about this. All the people that worked very hard to establish Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. Who gave their money to establish Harvard, Yale, and Princeton 200 years ago and back for that.

You know that if they were suddenly brought back to life and saw what was taught at Harvard , Yale, and Princeton today, they would be absolutely appalled, right? They'd be totally appalled. They'd say, I want my money back.

And you say, well, everybody says, yes, of course, but you see, they were back then and we're enlightened now. You see, of course, we couldn't teach what they taught. We're enlightened now.

But you realize, don't you, that 100 years from now, you're great-grandchildren if you have great-grandchildren are going to think you're just as enlightened, just as stupid, the belief you got right now that you think are so progressive and so right on. And they're so different than those poor, benign, unenlightened people from 100 years ago. You know that people are going to look at you that way in 100 years.

And everything you do, even if you do anything worth keeping and anything that's last and will be used by people who you consider fools. And therefore, nothing you do will accomplish anything. You're not going to accomplish anything at all.

It's meaningless if this life is all there is. We always say the gospel changes everything and we believe it really does. That's why here at Gospel In Life, August is Go and Share Month.

Throughout August, we're inviting thousands of our listeners to take a small step in sharing the gospel with someone God has placed in your life. For those of you who make a gift to gospel in life this month, we'll send you two copies of making sense of God by Tim Keller. It's a powerful resource that explores how Christianity makes emotional, cultural, and rational sense in today's world.

It's our thanks for your gift and provides a way you can do a small act to share the gospel. By reading the book with a friend, giving one to a coworker, or passing on both copies to people who are exploring the Christian faith. It's a simple way to start a gospel conversation or continue it.

To request your two copies of making sense of God, simply go to gospelinlife.com slash give. Again, that's gospelinlife.com slash give. Now, here's Dr.

Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. And here's what you get for it, verse 23. All their days, their work is grief and pain even at night their minds are not rest.

You spend all of your life anxious. All of your life restless. All of your life working like crazy.

And in the end, it goes nowhere. That's the end of the thought experiment.

欢迎来到《福音与生活》。当有人在思考人生的最深层次的问题时，我是谁？这个世界出了什么问题？真正能让我完整的是什么呢？

耶稣不只是给我们答案，他更给了我们他自己。在这个月的播客中，提姆·凯勒探讨了如何分享我们在基督里的盼望作为人生意义和目的的答案。你可能已经知道，八月份是戈恩在《福音与生活》中的分享月，我们精心准备了一系列免费资源，帮助你在生活中简单地向他人分享福音。你可以通过访问 gospelandlife.com/share 获取这些资源。

我们认为上帝常常使用微小的行为成就伟大的事，因此邀请你在本月做一些简单的小事来分享福音，因为福音改变了所有的一切。今天的经文选自《传道书》第二章第9节至26节：“我后来比从前在耶路撒冷的人更伟大；我在智慧和心意上，都得了许多的智慧。” 当我回顾自己所做的一切以及辛苦所得时，发现这一切都是虚空，是捕风。因为在日光之下，并无新事。

我又转念去思考智慧、愚昧和狂妄的事。国王之后能比在位的国王做什么呢？我看到智慧胜过愚昧，如同光明胜过黑暗一样。聪明人的眼睛在头前，愚昧人的道路在黑暗中；但我也发现，他们最终的命运是一样的。

我说：“愚昧人的命运也将临到我身上。”那么，我因智慧而得的好处又是什么呢？我又说：“这也是虚空。”因为聪明人和愚昧人都要被遗忘，他们的日子已经过去，都被遗忘了。

聪明人和愚昧人一样都要死亡。所以，我厌恶生命，因为太阳底下所做的一切工作在我看来都是沉重的负担。这一切都是虚空，追逐风影。我也憎恨我在太阳底下辛勤劳作的一切，因为我必须将它们留给后人。

谁知道那后人是智慧还是愚昧呢？他们却要继承我用智慧、知识和技能在太阳底下所劳碌得来的成果。这也是一场虚空。因此，我的内心开始对所有辛劳感到绝望，在太阳底下所做的工作都是徒然的。

因为一个人可以智慧地、有知识地、有能力地劳作，但最终他的一切都将留给另一个未曾为之付出的人。这也是虚空，是极大的不幸。人们在太阳底下所做的一切努力和焦虑追求又得到了什么呢？他们的一生都在忧愁和痛苦中度过，甚至到了夜晚也无法得到安宁。

这也是一场虚空。人所能做的最好事情就是吃喝，并从自己的劳碌中找到满足。我看到这一切都是出于神的手，没有他，谁能吃、谁能享受呢？神赐给那些使他喜悦的人智慧、知识和快乐；但对罪人来说，他只赐给他们聚集财富的任务，好把它们交给那使他喜悦的人。

这也是一场虚空，追逐风影。这是主的话。感谢神。你知道吗，在《白鲸记》第九十六章中，赫尔曼·梅尔维尔说，《传道书》是世界上真正最真实的一本书。

你们当然知道这一点，并且也知道其中一章的内容吧？刚才你们听到的《传道书》，实际上至少是最难理解的一本书之一。当然，第一次阅读时会感到非常困惑，因为它描绘了一个极其失望的人。事实上，在《传道书》的第一节中，作者这样写道：虚空、虚空、完全虚空；一切都是虚空。

而我们在第十七节读到的那些话，却是非常鼓舞人心的话。所以我就厌恶生命，因为太阳底下所做的一切在我眼中都是虚空、毫无意义。你可能会疑惑：为什么圣经会说人生毫无意义呢？要理解这里的意思，你需要记住两件事。

第一点是，作者在《传道书》第一章第一节中被明确提到，他的名字叫科赫勒斯。这是一个很难翻译的希伯来词，很多人认为它意味着教授。而你们这些参加过研究生研讨会的人应该知道，在研讨会上，教授不会直接讲授，而是通过提问引导大家思考。第二点是，这里有一个小术语，你可以在第一章开头看到，甚至在这一段的开始也能发现。

他说：“我比以前任何一位耶路撒冷的人都要伟大得多，我的智慧一直伴随着我。” 作者反复说：我追求享乐，但我的智慧始终伴随我；我在耶路撒冷所做的一切都超过了任何人，我的智慧也一直伴随我。这听起来有些奇怪，但实际上这是一种古老的思考方式——他正在做一个思想实验。他假设自己处于这种情境中，比如如果我让你做一个思想实验，我会说：想象一下这种情况，并且在这种条件下，你认为会发生什么？

这就是他在做的事情。时不时他说：“我的智慧始终伴随着我”，这是在告诉我们：现在看，我要看看这能教会我们什么。这有点像一个演员走上舞台开始扮演某个角色，但每隔一段时间就走到台侧对观众说：“现在让我们看看从这个角度能学到什么。”实际上，这就是理解传道书的秘诀。

它是一系列的思想实验，在这些实验中，教授在说：“让我们设想这样生活，再设想那样生活，然后我们看到了什么，这又意味着什么呢？” 这种思想实验有效吗？而“我的智慧仍与我同在”这句话的意思是，显然我在进行思想实验，但我仍然是我自己。所以我说要为此生活，但同时也在审视自己，明白了吗？

因此，如果你想理解传道书的意图，**我们需要看看这些思想实验。**让我给你展示一个长的思想实验及其主要教训。在这段我们读过的经文中，有一个简短的思想实验和一个箭头。好的，这里有一个主要的思想实验及教训，还有一个小的思想实验在文末，并且有指向或提示。

跟我来。首先，最大的那个。最大的思想实验是如何看待“在日光之下”的生活。你看，在传道书中，“在日光之下”这个词出现了30次。

你会发现他所说的并不是生活毫无意义，而是说生活是无意义的“在日光之下”。比如，在第11节中说：“人在日光之下所作的一切并无益处。”第17、20和22节也有类似的说法，并且在书中共出现了30次。那么这又意味着什么呢？

注释家和学者会说，当他提到“我观察了生活‘在日光之下’”，意思是他在不考虑永恒或上帝的情况下审视了现实生活。让我们暂时假设这就是全部的生活。他就是这样做的。现在，这被称为世俗心态，你在这里要小心。

成为一个世俗的人并不意味着是无神论者。当然，《传道书》的作者当时根本不知道有无神论者，因为那时还没有这种人。即使在今天，尽管我们生活在一个很大程度上是世俗的文化中，真正无神论者的比例也不高，不是很大一部分人。加拿大哲学家查尔斯·泰勒最近写了一本关于世俗主义、一个世俗时代的重要书籍，他说，世俗并不是不相信有上帝或来世。

而是说，没有人能知道是否存在上帝，也没有人能知道是否有来世。因此，顺便说一句，“世俗”这个词来源于拉丁语的“secule”，意思是现在。基本上，世俗心态就是说：可能有上帝，也可能没有；可能有来世，也可能没有。但我们可以知道的是这个世界和这个生命，是时间与空间。

因此，一个世俗的人会说：不管有没有上帝，我们都要在这里找到安慰，在这里找到快乐，在这里找到生活的意义。这就是“在日光之下”的生活。所以，这是一次重要的思想实验，也是《传道书》的主要内容之一，作者就是在说：好吧，我将把生命视为唯一能知道的东西，并且只基于现在可以拥有的东西来构建我的生活。然后我会问：这样的生活是否具有意义？

是否令人满意？他从三个角度进行了这个实验，探讨如何像认为这是一切那样生活。一种方式就是我们所说的“快乐项目”。在第1至11节中，他想象自己享受着所有感官上的快乐，所谓感官上的快乐就是指感官的愉悦。

在这1到11节中，虽然这里没有印出第二章的内容，但他提到自己有一个后宫，有性爱，有美食，有豪宅，有仆人，他拥有一切感官上的快乐，一切感官的享受，并在第10节总结道：“我什么都没有拒绝，我的眼睛所愿的我都得到了。”所以他就是为享乐而活。那么发生了什么呢？他在第11节告诉你，但当他审视这一切时，发现一切都是虚空的，是追风赶月，太阳底下没有得到任何东西。

顺便说一句，“追风赶月”这个词用来形容追求感官快乐再合适不过了。当你只为享受快乐而活的时候，就像在追逐风一样，这是什么意思呢？风确实可以感受到，对吧？当然你可以感觉到风的存在，但你真的能抓住它吗？

或者试图跑在它的前面或掌握住它吗？不能。所以当人们追求感官上的快乐时，也会有这样的感觉：是的，很美好，但当你正享受它的时候，它却在瞬间消逝。多年前，我想我会读给你听，有一位女士曾住在纽约，并为《村声报》撰稿，她的名字叫辛西娅·海姆尔（Cynthia Heimel）。

后来她搬到了洛杉矶，并开始为《花花公子》杂志撰稿。她是一位非常节制的作家，在1989年，也就是我搬到这里的那一年，《村声报》上刊登了她的专栏文章。她在文中提到，尽管自己很节制，但她的话却说得很对。那时她已经认识了一些曾在夜店当保镖、礼帽保管员等职位的人，并且其中有些人后来成为了著名的电影明星。

她提到了两三个她所知道的名人，其中一个就是她当年在梅西百货化妆品柜台工作时遇到的那个大明星。她认识他们，之前有一个大明星，他在电影院工作时，只是在那儿卖票而已。现在他们都出名了。她说，在所有情况下，不是她们仍然认识这些人，就是认识知道这些人的朋友。

在所有情况下，他们的幸福感都比成功前更差。他们更加愤怒，更加焦虑。实际上，她有点讽刺地说过这样的话，这是剪报上的内容：那个他们苦苦追求的成名，本应让他们一切变得美好的东西，并没有实现这个目标，他们的生活依旧艰难，幸福并未到来。失望使他们变得狂躁而难以忍受。

这和传道书所说的完全一样。他说，你知道，如果你只为了享乐而活，那根本行不通。它就是不奏效的。就像追逐风一样。

从本质上讲，追求享乐并不是快乐的源泉，每一个这样生活的人都是这么说的。那么，如果这个世界上只有这一回事，你还能做些什么呢？另外一种选择是，他转向了智慧。注意，在第12节中他说：“我转念思想智慧和疯狂与愚昧。

” 他离开了享乐，尝试着去寻找智慧。他思考智慧比愚蠢好，就像光明比黑暗好一样。有智慧的人在他们的头脑里拥有光明，而愚蠢的人则在黑暗中徘徊。那么他在说什么呢？

“生活为了智慧”意味着什么？很可能，在这个关于世间万物的实验性思考中，“智慧”这个词指的是哲学。自古希腊人发明了哲学以来，哲学就是试图用人类理性来探究生命的意义和如何生活的学科，而不依赖于宗教。不是没有宗教哲学家，但总的来说，哲学的核心在于使用理性思考，通过理性去探寻生命的意义和人类应当如何生活，而不依赖于宗教和上帝。

当然，古希腊人是最早也是最出色的哲学家之一，他们想方设法去探索生命的意义、宇宙背后的真相以及支撑宇宙的道德准则，以便我们若遵循这些法则，就能顺应宇宙的本质，过上充实而明智的生活。哲学家的任务就是告诉人们，什么是正确的生活方式，什么是明智的生活方式，以及如何生活才能与事物的真实本质相契合？他就是这样做的。他开始追求学习、学术和智慧，但结果呢？

哦，这真是太神奇了。这是这本书中的一大亮点之一。他说，在第14节中，他意识到一个道理：无论是智者还是愚人，最终都会遭遇同样的命运。那些努力变得聪明的人，那些试图通过思考来寻求答案的哲学家们。

生命的意义是什么？人们应该如何生活？什么是正确与错误？正义的意义何在？

我们如何定义正义？你一直在思考、思考再思考，试图让这个世界变得更美好，但结果呢？然后他自问：愚人的命运也会降临到我身上。那么，我成为智者又能得到什么呢？

这也毫无意义。因为对于智者和愚人来说，最终都是一样的，都会被遗忘。像愚人一样，智者也终将死去。这真是非常有趣。

在哲学史上，实际上如果追溯到让-保罗·萨特、克尔凯郭尔、阿尔贝·加缪等人，他们正是这么说的。他们的观点是：如果生命就是一切，而你死后腐烂，太阳消失时整个文明也随之消亡，没有人会记得你曾经做过的一切。你知道**这意味着什么吗？这意味着你的生活方式无关紧要，你是个好人还是坏人、慈善家还是连环杀手，结果都是一样的。**

想想这个。如果这就是我们的一切，那么人类文明能延续一千万年吗？我想不会，或者两千万年，甚至一亿年？好吧。

然而，在那些漫长的死寂时间之前和之后，宇宙聚集起来，地球形成了生命，然后在太阳熄灭后所有文明消失后的漫长死寂时间里，即使人类文明延续了一亿年。与那些之前的漫长死寂时间和之后的漫长死寂时间相比，这就像一瞬间，就像一秒钟，就像一个瞬间。你所做的一切都不会被记住，所有人都会被遗忘。**这意味着你的任何行为都不重要，没有任何意义，没有任何区别，完全无关紧要。**

你说，但有啊，因为这样会让世界变得更好多久？如果这就是我们的一切，那么你所做的每一件事都是微不足道的，所有的哲学都是微不足道的。智慧的生活和愚蠢的生活之间没有区别。不仅如此。

最后，他思考了一下，好吧，那工作呢？科赫拉说：“如果我为了成就而生活呢？如果我不追求快乐、智慧、才华和洞察力，而是追求成就呢？” 当然，同样的情况也会发生，在第17节中你可以看到这一点。

所以他说：“因为我恨生命，因为所有在太阳下所做的工作都是徒劳的。” 如果这就是我们的一切，那么在太阳下所做的一切工作都让我感到痛苦。这一切都是追逐风的结果。为什么是这样呢？

他给出了两个原因，其中有： > 他说，首先，他说：“我厌恶我在日头之下的劳碌所得，因为我要将它留给不知劳碌为何物的人。”他确实说对了。你们都知道这些人。这是不争的事实。

毫无疑问，那些为建立哈佛、耶鲁和普林斯顿大学而辛勤工作的所有人。200年前甚至更早时期捐赠金钱的人们，如果他们突然复活，看到今天在哈佛、耶鲁和普林斯顿教授的内容，一定会大吃一惊，对吧？他们会说：“我要拿回我的钱。” 你说，当然，每个人都会这么说，但你看，他们那时候是那样想的，而我们现在是开明的。

你们看，我们当然不能教他们当时教的东西，因为我们现在开明了。但是你明白吗，100年后，如果你有曾孙辈的话，他们会认为你现在所认为的先进和正确的东西，同样是愚蠢的。他们会说那些100年前的人既无知又不开化。你知道100年后的他们会如何看待你们。

无论你做什么，即使你做了一些值得保留的事情，甚至被你认为是傻瓜的人使用，但你所做的也不会有任何成就。你根本不会取得任何成就。如果生命只有一次，这一切都是无意义的。我们总是说福音改变了这一切，并且我们相信确实如此。

这就是为什么在《生命中的福音》中，八月是我们“走出去分享”的月份。整个八月，我们邀请成千上万的听众迈出一小步，与上帝放在你生命中的人分享福音。如果你在这个月向《生命中的福音》捐款，我们将赠送你两本提摩西·基勒所著的《理解神》。这是一份强有力的资源，探讨了基督教在当今世界如何从情感、文化和理性方面做出解释。

我们感谢你们的礼物，这为你们提供了一个机会，可以做一些小事来分享福音。你可以和朋友一起读这本书、给同事送一本，或者把两本都送给正在探索基督教信仰的人。这是一种开始或继续福音对话的简单方式。要请求获得两本《理解上帝》的书籍，请访问 gospelinlife.com/give。

再次提醒，网址是 gospelinlife.com/give。接下来，让我们听 Keller 博士今天的余下部分教导。根据经文 23 节：他们的一生都在劳碌中度过，白天黑夜都不得安宁。你们一生都在焦虑中度过。

你们一生都在不安中度过。你们一生都在拼命工作。到最后，这一切都毫无意义。这就是这个思想实验的结论。

## 你无法自造意义 / You Cannot Create Your Own Meaning

What is the lesson?

Well the lesson is actually clear. The way to get an understanding of ecclesiastes is to look at the repetition, the repetitious, the repeated phrases. And so the phrase under the sun is a key to the first thought experiment.

And the phrase meaningless, meaningless, this is meaningless, that's meaningless. It's the lesson. It's saying that if this life is all we can know.

And if you base your meaning in life on just things that are here, you have no meaning, no lasting meaning, and no sustainably enduring satisfying life. Now, you know that the new atheists, people who in the last few years have been writing very aggressive atheist books, say that that's wrong. They don't like what I just said.

See here I'm saying, and what the co-hello professor is saying, is if there is no life beyond the sun, if this world is all we have, and we only have to live for what's here, well, there is no meaning in life, no solid meaning in life. And of course, they're saying that's not true. Stephen J.

Gould, who used to, who's passed away, but he used to teach at NYU and at Harvard, one time he was asked, why are we here? What's our purpose? And he says, well, we're here because one group of fish had a particular fin anatomy that could transform into legs for terrestrial creatures.

And then he said, we may yearn for a higher answer, but none exists. In other words, we're here by accident. There's nobody put us here.

He says, this explanation, superficially troubling, maybe even terrifying, is ultimately liberating. Why? Because we can't get meaning in life by looking at nature, we must construct these answers for ourselves.

And Richard Dawkins is the same thing. He says, the truly adult view is our life is as meaningful and as wonderful as we choose to make it. Now here's what they mean.

They said, yes, of course, you can't, when Stephen J. Gould says, you can't read meaning out of the facts of nature. What he means is, you can't say, why were we put here?

What is our purpose? What is our meaning? Why were we put here?

We weren't put here. We just came. We're here by accident.

And when we die, darkness. But they say, you can decide what you want your meaning in life to be. You can decide I'm going to live to deal with hunger and Africa.

You can decide I'm going to live for this cause or I'm going to live for to be a good artist. You decide what you want to live for and you can have a perfectly meaningful life. You decide what you want to live for.

That doesn't work. Not only has the Cohella, the professor has shown how that doesn't work, it only works if you don't think. But it doesn't work even if you don't think.

Victor Frankel, the Jewish psychologist that was put into the death camps during World War II, but he survived. And he wrote a lot of books and much of what he says, I've always found fascinating and applicable to a variety of things, but I'll tell you what I think they are now. Let me apply it to this.

Frankel noted that during, when in the death camp, some prisoners lost everything. Some prisoners became bad. They started to steal from other prisoners.

They started to collaborate with the enemy. Other prisoners just became like zombies, they just became lost. Some of them literally curled up and died.

In other words, they lost themselves. But there were other prisoners that stayed strong, stayed courageous, stayed brave, stayed caring for people. Now, here's the question, why?

Why was it that some people went into the death camps and just basically just went away. They lost themselves and other people remained themselves. What was the difference?

And here's what Frankel said, it depended on what they made their meaning in life. Because if you make your meaning in life something the death camp can take away, then you got no self-left. Now, what sort of things can death camp take away, anything under the sun?

If you live for family, you may think you're pretty noble. I live for my family. Death camp takes it away.

The death, it's gone. They're maybe dead. You don't know where they are.

They're taken away from you. Maybe they're all dead. What if you live for some political cause?

What if you live for status? What if you live for career? What if you live for making money?

What if you live for sex and romance? Whatever you live for, the death camp takes away from you. If it's something here, something under the sun, something got it.

And you don't have a self-left. The only people that stayed strong, stayed themselves were people who live for something that death camps couldn't take away, something that wasn't under the sun, something like God, something like faith, something like, say, and therefore here's the lesson. You actually can't create meaning for yourself.

You have to discover meaning in something, some reality higher than yourself. Let me say that again. You actually can't do what Dawkins says.

You can't create meaning for yourself. You have to discover meaning by discovering some reality more important than you. And if you say, well, I decide I'm going to have meaning in life by living for that.

No, I think I'll do that. No, I think I'll do that. You don't really have any higher thing that gives you meaning.

You're just living for yourself. You're just serving yourself. You're doing that because it makes you feel good about yourself.

You're doing that because it's satisfying. You do that. You're just living for yourself.

You don't really have meaning. There's nothing that is more higher than you. There's no higher meaning.

And you don't have a meaning that will last. It's just death camps, but all sorts of things can take it away from you. You know that.

And you won't have a self-left. But if you live for God, if you live for Him, if you base your meaning on something beyond the sun, above the sun, nothing can take that away. You understand.

And therefore, you see, Sartre was right, not Dawkins. And the existential is right when they said this. If your origin is meaningless, we hear by accident, and your destiny is meaningless, you're going to nothing.

See, Dawkins says, okay, we're here by accident. Nobody put us here. When we die, we rot.

But meanwhile, we can have a meaningful life. You can decide what to live for. Sartre basically said, if your origin is meaningless, and your destiny is meaningless, have the guts to admit, your life is meaningless.

Everything in the middle is meaningless. And see, Kierkegaard, sorry, Kierkegaard, wrote a book in 1849, a little book called The Sickness unto Death. And you know what it is?

It's the spiritual nausea of trying to build your meaning in life on things here and always being afraid, always being restless, always afraid. It's like a chasing after the one you never can quite do it. You're always anxious.

You never can seem to quite grab. It's a spiritual nausea, a sense of meaninglessness, a sense of futility underneath everything. I think that's probably where Sartre got his idea for his great work, nausea.

If your origin is meaningless, and your destiny is meaningless, have the guts to admit, your life is meaningless. ### Life With God at the Center

Now, that's the big experiment, and that's the lesson. What's the small experiment?

There's a little thought experiment, which fortunately for you, if you're looking at your clock, is not going to take as long to get through as the first thought of the experiment. And it's only here in verse 24, 25, and 26. Suddenly, see, if you're reading the book of Ecclesiastes, the word God is nowhere to be seen except just one little place in the beginning of chapter 1.

So all through chapter 1 and 2, the word God isn't here. Why? Because it's a thought experiment.

We're looking at life under the sun. In verse 24 to 26, God comes up. In fact, all the way into chapter 3, the word God is used ten times.

And he says, a person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil. This too, I see from the hand of God. For without him who can eat or find enjoyment to the person who pleases God, him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and happiness.

Now suddenly, everything has changed. God is back in the picture. And so we have a new thought experiment.

Now let's look at life with God in the center. And suddenly, all the things that before were chasing after the wind, were never quite in our grasp, were always burdens or emptiness. Suddenly, these things are gifts.

Because see, if you look in 24, work now as a gift, satisfaction in our own toil. God's hand gives us satisfaction in our work. That's verse 24.

And God gives us pleasure in even our daily food. Verse 25. You don't need herms and feasts.

If God's in the picture, even your daily food is a gift, you can get satisfaction in your toil. And it says to the person who pleases him, God gives wisdom. So all the things that before were burdens, wisdom, work, pleasure are now gifts.

Why? Well, you say, I guess it's just saying that you have to base your life on God. Yes, but how?

What if you make it your meaning in life will change things such that now the things that were burdens suddenly become gifts? One is what will give you meaning in life, that will last, they'll give you solid satisfaction and a solid identity. What is it?

It's not just obeying God, it's pleasing him. Twice it says to the one who pleases God. Now, I want you to think about that for a second.

What does it mean to live for somebody's pleasure? See, there's many people who say, oh, I've lived for God, and when I say, what do you mean? Well, I went to church and I obeyed the thing, Commandments, and I read my Bible every day.

Well, are you, but I'm not doing that anymore. I'm not religious anymore. Why not?

Well, I prayed, and God never gave me anything that I asked for. I tried very hard. I lived a good life, and yet he wasn't coming for it.

You know, I didn't have good health. I didn't get into the school I wanted to get into. This and that bad happened.

So you know what? It's possible to obey God, not for God's sake, but for your sake. You're praying, you think you're very religious, but you're obeying God to get the things here in this world, under the sun, and they're the real reason you're living.

And then you have a meaning in life that is actually just as unstable. You've got an identity that's just as unstable as the so-called secular person. You may think of yourself very religious, but if you're living for God, you think, in order to get things, to get blessings, to get health, to get success, you're just as unstable as everybody else is, and you'll have that spiritual nausea, too.

Well, then what should you be? You should be someone who serves God, yes, and obeys God, yes, just to give him pleasure. Let me tell you what real love is.

It's not just emotional. It's not just saying, I want a relationship with you because I desire you, and I'm attracted to you, and being with you makes me happy. That's part of it, but that's certainly not the heart of it.

And also love is not mainly volitional. It's not just, well, I have to do my duty, and I have to serve you. Let me tell you what real love is.

You know you love somebody when you put your happiness into their happiness, so that your greatest happiness is just to see them happy. You've inserted your happiness in their happiness, so that you don't make them happy to feel good about yourself, and you don't just seek them just because it makes you... You put your happiness into their happiness, so when they're happy, you're happy.

Their joy is your joy. Their delight is your delight. There's nothing beyond it.

Then you know you love somebody, then you know you love somebody. And the only way to get a meaningful life is not just to obey God in some dutiful way, in which case you're still essentially building your life on things here, the death cams can take away from you, and a lot of other things can do. You need to obey God because you just wanted to light him, because you adore him that much, because you love him that much.

Well, how does that happen, you say, arrow? This little thought experiment kind of ends, but there's a pointer in it to something else. There's commentators point out, point out, that God in these four verses, these three verses are constantly giving gifts.

God gives the gift of satisfaction, God gives the gift of finding enjoyment, God gives the gift of wisdom and knowledge, and then guess what? He gives one more gift, you know, do you see what it is? He gives the center of the gift of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God, this too is meaningless and chasing after the wind.

The last thing he gives, the last gift he gives is he gives people the gift of futility and meaninglessness. Now, you say, how in the world is that a gift? Isn't that a punishment?

Isn't that a curse? It depends on what you do with it. Because in Romans 18, it says, God subjected this world to futility, meaninglessness in hope.

If God gives you, right now, if God is giving you an enhanced feeling of meaninglessness and futility in life, and this is New York, so I bet you that's true quite a number of you. It could be a gift if you let it drive you to where you should go. It could be a gift if it points you, if it gets you somewhere, you say, well, where?

那么，这有什么教训呢？其实教训非常明确。要理解《传道书》的关键在于观察重复出现的词语和短语。因此，“凡事都有个时候，在天之下”是第一个思想实验的关键短语。

“虚空、虚空，一切都是虚空。”这是教训。它告诉我们，如果这就是我们所知道的一切生活， 如果我们把生活的意义仅仅建立在眼前的事物上，那么生活中就没有真正的意义，没有持久的满足感和可持续的生活。你们也知道，最近几年写了一些非常激进无神论书籍的新无神论者们不同意这一点。

他们不喜欢我说的话。你看，我说的是，正如霍洛教授所说，如果除了太阳之外没有生命，如果我们只生活在这个世界上，并且只为这里的东西而活，那么生活中就没有意义，没有坚实的意义，也没有持久满足的生活。当然，他们认为这是不对的。史蒂芬·J·古尔德（Stephen J. Gould）曾执教于纽约大学和哈佛大学，在一次被问及我们为什么在这里、我们的目的是什么时，他说：“我们之所以存在是因为一群鱼具有特定的鳍部解剖结构，可以转化为陆地生物的腿。

” 然后他说，我们或许渴望一个更高的答案，但其实没有这样的答案。换句话说，我们是偶然来到这里的，并没有人把我们带来。他指出，这个解释虽然表面上令人不安，甚至让人恐惧，但却最终是一种解放。为什么呢？

因为我们在生活中无法从自然界找到意义，我们必须为自己构建这些答案。理查德·道金斯也是如此。他说，真正成熟的观点是我们的人生的意义和美好程度取决于我们自己选择赋予它多少意义。现在让我们看看他们所指的意思是什么。

他们说，当然，当你像史蒂芬·杰伊·古尔德所说的那样，你不能从自然的事实中读出意义时，他指的是，你不能问：为什么我们会在这里？我们的目的是什么？我们的意义何在？我们为什么会在这里？

我们并不是被安排来的。我们只是来了。我们是偶然来到这里的。当我们死去的时候，就是黑暗。

但他们说，你可以决定自己生命的意义。你可以决定你要为解决非洲的饥饿而活。你可以选择为这个事业而活，或者你也可以选择成为一个好艺术家而活。你自己决定要为什么而活，并且可以拥有一段非常有意义的人生。

你自己决定要为什么而活。这并不奏效。不仅科尔哈教授已经证明了这一点不奏效，即使你不思考，这种方法也不奏效。维克多·弗兰克尔是一位在二战期间被关进死亡集中营的犹太心理学家，但他幸存了下来，并写了许多书。

他所说的一些话我一直觉得非常有趣且适用到各种事情上，但让我现在告诉你我认为它们意味着什么。弗兰克尔注意到，在集中营里，有些囚犯失去了所有东西。有些囚犯变得恶劣起来，开始从其他囚犯那里偷窃，甚至与敌人合作。有些囚犯则成了行尸走肉，完全迷失了自我。

有些人甚至蜷缩着死去。换句话说，他们失去了自己。但还有一些囚犯保持坚强、勇敢和善良，继续关心他人。现在的问题是：为什么？

为什么有些人走进集中营后就彻底消失了，失去了自我，而另一些人则保持了自我？这其中的区别在哪里？弗兰克尔说，关键在于他们生命中的意义是什么。

如果你的生命意义是集中营能够夺走的东西，那么你就没有剩下的自我。因为集中营可以夺走什么？一切都在它的掌控之下。比如，你为了家庭而活，你觉得很高尚。

我为了我的家庭而活。但集中营夺走了你的家庭——死亡带走了他们，你不知道他们在哪儿，被夺走了。或者你为了某种政治事业而活，为了地位、职业或金钱而活，为了性与爱情而活……无论你为了什么而活，集中营都会将这一切从你身边夺走。如果这些是你生命中的东西，那么你就没有剩下的自我了。

只有那些为了集中营无法夺走的东西而活的人保持了坚强和自我——比如上帝、信仰或某种超越世俗的价值——他们才能在逆境中屹立不倒。这堂课告诉我们：实际上，你不能为自己创造意义。你需要发现比自己更高的现实中的意义。让我再重复一遍：你不能像道金斯所说的那样为自己创造意义。

你需要通过发现比你自己更重要的现实来找到意义。如果你说：“我要为那个而活。”“我要为那个而活。”那其实并没有什么更高贵的东西赋予你意义，你只是在自我满足。

你只是为了让自己感觉良好而活着，只是为了满足自己而活着。实际上，你没有真正的意义。因为你没有比你自己更高的东西。没有更高的意义。

你没有永恒的意义。那只是集中营，但各种各样的事情都可以夺走它。你知道。你也无法拥有自我。

但如果你们为神而活，如果你们以祂为中心，把意义建立在太阳之上甚至之上的东西上，那么没有什么可以夺走它。你能理解吗？因此，你们知道，萨特是对的，而不是道金斯。存在主义也对，在他们所说的这一点上是正确的。

如果你的意义是无意义的，我们只是偶然地来到这里，而我们的归宿也是无意义的，那么你将一无所获。你看，道金斯说，好吧，我们是偶然来到这里的。没有人把我们带到这里。当我们死的时候，我们会腐烂。

但与此同时，我们可以拥有有意义的生活。你可以决定为之奋斗的目标。萨特基本上说，如果你的意义从一开始就是无意义的，而你的归宿也是无意义的，那么你有勇气承认，你的生活是无意义的。中间的一切都是无意义的。

你看，克尔凯郭尔，不，是克尔凯郭尔，在1849年写了一本书，叫做《存在之病》。你知道那是什么吗？那就是一种精神上的恶心感——试图在生命中建立意义，却总是害怕、不安和焦虑，就像追逐一个永远无法捉住的东西一样。你总是焦虑。

你总感觉抓不住。这是一种精神上的恶心感，一种无意义的感觉，一种在一切之下的徒劳感。我认为萨特在他的伟大作品《厌恶》中就是从这一点得到灵感的。如果你的意义从一开始就是无意义的，而你的归宿也是无意义的，那么你有勇气承认，你的生活是无意义的。

## 以神为中心的生活 / Jesus Took Our Meaninglessness

What? Here's what you should be looking at. In Jesus Christ died on the cross, he cried out, my God, my God, why has thou forsaken me?

Do you know what he was experiencing when he said that? He was experiencing life without God. He was praying to God and God wasn't there.

He looked to the heavens and the heavens were brass. He was stuck here. He was experiencing life without God.

He was stuck under the sun. And he was experiencing spiritual nausea, profound nausea, spiritual futility, meaninglessness because God wasn't there for him. Why was he doing that?

He was getting what we deserved. We've tried to get away from God and we deserve life without God. And the nausea and the meaninglessness, but Jesus Christ came, went to the cross to take the punishment we deserve so that God can forgive us.

And he can love us and we can connect to him. So Jesus Christ got life without God on the cross so that we can have life with God or put it this way. On the cross, Jesus was putting himself in our lives.

He was inserting himself. He was putting himself in our misery. He was putting himself in our mortality.

He was going to the depths for us. That's love. He couldn't be happy unless we were happy.

And so he put himself in our misery. And when you see him doing that, that will get you to want to just delight in him. When you see him sacrificing for you, when you see him putting his love into you, his happiness into your happiness, that makes you want to put your happiness into his.

It makes you delight in him. And that is what you need. You can't just say, well, I need it the light and God.

I need to be a God, please. I need to be someone who loves God and obeys God just in order to please Him. You've got to see Him do this to attract you so that His pleasure is your pleasure, that there's nothing that delights you more than the delight the one who did this for you.

And then if you can do that, to the degree you can do that, you'll have a meaning in life that is bomb proof, that is death can't prove. And everything in life will become a gift. Wow.

That's quite a lesson, Professor. Let us pray. Our Father, we thank You for helping us to see that Jesus Christ took the meaninglessness of our lives.

He took life without God so we could have life with you. And when we see Him doing that, that makes us want to please Him. Now Lord, as we protect the Lord's Supper, as we see in a sense, you pouring yourself out for us, Lord Jesus Christ, move us so that we can delight in you more deeply and have the life of meaning that sees everything as a gift.

We thank You for this. We pray You to apply it to our hearts by the Holy Spirit and Jesus name we pray, amen. Thanks for listening to today's teaching.

It's our prayer that You were encouraged by it and that it helps you apply the gospel to your life and share it with others. For more helpful resources from Tim Keller, visit gospelandlife.com. There, you can subscribe to the gospel and life quarterly journal.

现在，这就是大实验和教训。小实验是什么呢？有一个小小的思考实验，幸运的是，如果你正在看手表，这个实验不会像第一个实验那样花太长时间。它只在第24、25和26节中提到。

突然间，你看，在《传道书》中，除了开头第一章的一处地方外，上帝的名几乎 nowhere to be seen。所以整章一和二都没有提到上帝的名字。为什么？因为这是一个思考实验。

我们在探讨人生的意义。在第24节到第26节，提到了神。实际上，在第三章的整章中，“神”这个词出现了十次。他这样说：“人所能做的最美好的事情就是吃喝，并从自己的劳碌中寻得满足。

”我看到这一切都是出于神的手。因为没有神，谁也不能吃或享受，使那讨神喜悦的人得到智慧、知识和快乐。现在一切都变了，神又回到了画面中。于是我们有了一个新的思考实验。

让我们来看一看以神为中心的人生。突然间，那些之前看似虚无缥缈的事物，总是抓不住的东西，总是负担或空虚的事物，都变成了礼物。因为你看，在第24节，劳作现在成了礼物，从自己的劳碌中寻得满足。神的手赐给我们劳作的满足感。

这就是第24节的内容。神还让我们在日常的食物中找到快乐。第25节说：“你不需要盛宴和大餐。”如果神在画面里，即使是你每天的食物也是礼物，你可以从劳碌中得到满足。

而且它说：“讨他喜悦的人，神会赐给他智慧。”所以之前那些负担——智慧、工作、快乐——现在都变成了礼物。为什么呢？你说，这大概只是说你必须以神为基础来生活。

是的，但是怎么做？如果把你的生命意义建立在讨神喜悦上，那么那些以前的负担就会变成礼物。是什么会给你带来持久的意义和满足感，让你有稳固的身份认同呢？不仅仅是遵从神，而是讨他的喜悦。

它两次提到“讨他喜悦的人”。现在我想请你思考一下。为了某人的喜悦而生活意味着什么？有很多人说他们为神活着，当我问他们具体指什么时，他们会回答：“我去教会，遵守诫命，每天读圣经。

” 但是你不再那样做了，你不信教了。为什么呢？你祈祷过，但神没有给你所求的任何东西。你努力了很久，过着很好的生活，然而他并没有回应你的祷告。

你知道吗？我身体不好，没考上理想的学校。种种不如意的事情接踵而至。所以呢？

你可以遵从上帝，并不是因为上帝的缘故，而是因为你自己的缘故。你在祷告，在你看来自己很虔诚，但其实你是为了在这个世界上得到一些东西，这些才是你活着的真正原因。于是你的人生意义其实也是不稳定的。你的身份认同也和所谓的世俗之人一样不稳定。

你以为自己很虔诚，但如果是为了上帝而活，为了得到什么、得到祝福、得到健康、得到成功，那你和别人一样是不稳定的，也会有灵性的不适感。那么你应该成为什么样的人呢？你应该是一个为上帝服务的人，一个遵从上帝的人，仅仅是为了取悦他。让我告诉你什么是真正的爱。

它不仅仅是情感上的。它不只是说我想和你建立关系因为你吸引我，和你在一起让我快乐。这确实是其中的一部分，但绝对不是核心所在。而且爱也不主要是出于义务的。

它不只是说我必须履行我的责任，必须为你服务。让我告诉你什么是**真正的爱。当你把你的幸福融入别人的幸福中时，你就知道你爱一个人了。你的最大幸福就是**看到他们幸福。

你把自己的快乐放在他们的快乐里，不是为了让他们对你感到满意，也不是仅仅因为你想要他们。而是将你的幸福与他们的幸福融为一体，当他们快乐时，你也快乐。他们的喜悦是你的喜悦。他们的快乐是你的快乐。

除此之外别无他求。当你知道爱一个人的时候，你就真正地爱上了那个人。而获得有意义的人生不是简单地以某种履行职责的方式遵从上帝，这样你仍然在用这个世界上的东西来构建自己的人生，这些东西随时可以被夺走。你需要因为热爱上帝、敬慕上帝而遵从祂，因为你爱他到这种程度。

那么，你是怎么想的呢？这个小思想实验似乎就到此为止了，但实际上它指向了另一件事。有评论家指出，在这四节经文中的前三节，神不断地赐下礼物。神赐下满足感作为礼物，神赐下享受作为礼物，神赐下智慧和知识作为礼物，然后猜猜看？

他再给一个礼物——你知道是什么吗？他赐下了积聚财富、储存财富并将其交给神所喜悦之人的中心礼物。这也毫无意义，追逐风中的幻影。最后，神赐下的最后一个礼物就是赋予人们虚无和无意义的体验。

你可能会问，这怎么能算作一种礼物呢？这不是惩罚吗？这不是诅咒吗？这取决于你怎么处理它。

因为在罗马书18章中说，神将这个世界置于虚无和无意义之中，但充满了希望。如果现在神赐予你生活中的增强的虚无感和无意义感，而你现在身处纽约，那么我敢打赌，这对你中的很多人来说是真实的。如果你让它引导你走向正确的方向，它可能是一份礼物；如果它能指引你、让你有所收获，你会问，那会是什么地方呢？### 耶稣担当了我们的虚无

你应该关注的是，在耶稣基督在十字架上受难时，他喊道："我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？

”你知道他在那一刻经历了什么吗？他体验到了没有神的生活。他在向神祈祷时，神却不在那里。他仰望天空，天空如同铜墙铁壁。

他被困在这里，体验着没有神的生活。他被太阳所困，经历着深刻的、精神上的恶心和无意义感，因为神并没有在他身边。为什么他会这样做呢？因为他承受了我们本该承担的惩罚。

我们试图远离神，所以现在我们经历了没有神的生活以及随之而来的恶心和无意义感。但耶稣基督来了，在十字架上受难以承受我们应得的惩罚，好让神能够赦免我们。他可以爱我们，我们也可以与祂相连。所以耶稣基督在十字架上没有上帝的生命，好让我们可以在有上帝的生命中。

或者说，在十字架上，耶稣把自己放在我们的生命里。祂把自己插入其中。祂把自己放在我们的痛苦中。祂把祂自己放在我们的有限中。

祂为我们在最深处寻求。这就是爱。除非我们快乐，祂不能快乐。所以祂把自己的痛苦承担起来。

当你看到祂这样做时，你会想要更喜悦地享受祂。当你看到祂为你牺牲，看到祂将自己的爱和快乐注入你身上，你的快乐也成了祂的快乐，这会让你想把自己的快乐奉献给祂。这会让你喜悦于祂。而这正是你需要的。

你不能只是说：“我需要光和上帝。”“我要成为上帝的人，请。”“我要成为一个爱上帝、顺服上帝的人，仅仅为了取悦祂。”你需要看到祂这样做来吸引你，使祂的喜乐成为你的喜乐，没有什么比那为你做这一切的人更让你喜悦的事了。

然后如果你能做到这一点，做到这个程度，你会在生活中找到一种坚不可摧的意义，死亡也证明不了。生活中的一切都会变成礼物。哇。这是一堂很好的课，教授。

让我们祷告吧。我们的天父，我们感谢祢帮助我们看到耶稣基督承担了我们生命的无意义。祂没有上帝的生命，好让我们可以与祢同有生命。当我们看到祂这样做时，使我们想要取悦祢。

现在主啊，在我们保护圣餐的时候，在某种意义上，看到祢为我们倾倒自己，主耶稣基督，求祢感动我们，使我们可以更深入地喜悦祢，并拥有一个看待一切为礼物的意义生活。感谢祢赐给我们这一切。求祢借着圣灵应用它在我们心中，奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。谢谢您今天聆听这堂教导。

愿祢被鼓励并帮助你将福音应用到生活中并与他人分享。更多来自提姆·凯勒的帮助资源，请访问gospelandlife.com。在那里，您可以订阅《福音与生活》季度期刊。当你这样做时，你还将收到免费的文章、讲道、灵修和其他以福音为中心的资源。
