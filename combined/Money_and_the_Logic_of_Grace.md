## 引言与经文诵读 / Introduction and Scripture Reading

Welcome to Gospel in Life. Why does the Bible talk about money so much? How we think about and use our money is one of the most common subjects throughout Scripture.

And the Bible tells us something striking. You cannot experience deep spiritual growth without putting your money and your attitude toward it in God's hands. Listen as Tim Keller shows us why generosity is not optional for Christians, but a vital mark of authentic faith.

Our Scripture reading tonight is from the Book of Luke chapter 14 verses 7-24. When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, he told them this parable. When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited.

If so, the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, give this man your seat. Then humiliated, you will have to take the least important place. But when you are invited, take the lowest place so that when your host comes, he will say to you, friend, move up to a better place.

Then you will be honored in the presence of all your fellow guests. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted. When Jesus said to his host, when you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers or relatives, or your rich neighbors.

If you do, they may invite you back, and so you will be repaid. But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the cripple, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.

When one of those at the table with him heard this, he said to Jesus, blessed is the man who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God. Jesus replied, a certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests. At the time of the banquet, he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited, come, for everything is now ready.

But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said, I have just bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please excuse me.

Another said, I have just bought five yoke of oxen, and I am on my way to try them out. Please excuse me. Still the other said, I just got married, so I can't come.

The servant came back and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry, and ordered his servant, go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town, and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame. Sir, the servant said, what you ordered has been done, but there is still room.

Then the master told his servant, go out to the roads and country lanes, and make them come in so that my house will be full. I tell you, not one of those men who were invited will get to taste of my banquet. This is the word of the Lord.

We are doing a short series in a month of June on the subject of how Christians ought to be looking at their money and their possessions. We are looking at what Luke says about it. Three of the passages we are looking at this month come from the Gospel of Luke one next week from Acts, the book of Acts which Luke also wrote, because Luke has so much to say about the subject, and we are choosing June to do this because when you talk about money to a congregation, I am going to minister talk about money to a congregation, and there is a campaign going on where there is the end of the year operating budget where there are some special offerings.

When you talk about, oh see, you need to give to this, it is actually natural for the listeners to concentrate on the this, on the cause, on the thing. Instead of sitting back and saying, well, what is God, how does God want me to think about money in general? What should my attitude be toward it?

How should I relate my giving to my spending? How much should I spend on my self, how much should I give away? That is what we want to look at here in the month of June because there is so much in the Bible about it.

So first of all, I actually only have two points to this sermon, not three, no, two. So maybe don't count on getting out early, but it is still two. The first point is that Jesus Christ in the middle of this chapter lays out an astonishing standard for sacrificial giving, absolutely astonishing, so astonishing, that it will seem unreasonable to us.

Then that is point one, secondly, I am going to show how Jesus actually shows how reasonable that kind of giving is because of the logic of the gospel. So point one, an astonishing standard that Jesus lays out there for sacrificial giving from us, his people, disciples, and then secondly, how he rationalizes that, how he grounds it in the logic of the gospel. So first of all, let's look at this amazing standard in the middle of the passage.

欢迎收听《生命中的福音》。为什么圣经中这么多次提到金钱？我们在金钱上的想法和使用方式是整本圣经中最常见的主题之一。并且，圣经告诉我们一个令人震惊的事实：没有把钱和对它的态度交在上帝手中，就无法经历深刻的灵性成长。

请聆听提摩太·基勒（Tim Keller）如何向我们展示为什么慷慨对于基督徒来说不是可选的，而是真实信仰的重要标志。今晚我们的经文来自路加福音第14章7-24节。当他注意到客人在宴席上挑选座位时，耶稣对他们讲了这个比喻：当有人邀请你参加婚宴的时候，不要去挑最好的位置；因为可能有比你更有名望的人也被邀请了。如果真是这样，主人会来对你说：“请把这个位子让给那个人。

”那时你会羞愧难当，只能坐在最不显眼的位置。但是当你被邀请时，就坐最末位吧，这样当主人来到时就会对你说：“朋友，请到我更好的位置上来。”那时你就可以在所有宾客面前得到荣耀。因为自高的人必被贬低，自卑的人必被升高。

耶稣对他的东道主说：当你摆设筵席的时候，不要邀请你的朋友、兄弟或亲戚，也不要邀请那些富有的人，免得他们也回请你，你就得到了回报。但是当你摆设筵席时，要请穷困的、残疾的、瘸腿的和瞎眼的人。这样你就会被祝福；虽然他们不能报答你，但在义人复活的时候你会得到报答。当餐桌上有人听见这话后对耶稣说：“主啊，得救的人有福了，因为他们可以参加天国里的宴席。

”耶稣回答说：有一个摆设大筵席的人请了许多客人。到了时候，他打发仆人去催那些被邀请的人来赴宴。仆人来到，把话传给他们；他们却都推辞。第一个说：“我刚买了一块地，必须去看看，请准假吧。

” 又有人说：“我刚买了五对牛，要去试试它们，所以请原谅我。”还有一个人说：“我刚娶了妻子，所以我不能来。” 仆人回来把这些话告诉主人。房主听了，就生气地说：“你去快快地到街上去，在那里把贫穷的、残废的、瞎眼的和瘸腿的人都召来。

”仆人回答说：“主人，我们已经照你的吩咐做了，但还是有空位子。” 于是主人对仆人说：“你再去街上，在乡间，把那些没有被邀请的人也请进来，使我的屋子坐满。我告诉你们：先前被邀请的人一个也不尝到我的筵席。”这是主的话。

我们在六月里做了一个简短的系列讲座，主题是如何让基督徒看待他们的金钱和财产。我们正在研究路加所写的内容。这个月我们将要讨论的三段经文都来自《路加福音》，下周我们将从《使徒行传》中再选取一段，因为路加在这方面的教导很多。我们选择在六月进行这个系列讲座，是因为当向会众谈论金钱时，人们往往会集中在某个具体的需要上，而忽略了更深层次的问题。

当你告诉听众要捐给某项事业时，他们自然会关注那个具体的事物。相反，我们应该退一步问：上帝怎么说呢？上帝希望我们对金钱有什么样的态度？我的奉献应该如何与消费相平衡？

我应该在自己身上花费多少？又该拿出多少来帮助别人？这些都是我们在六月这个系列讲座中要探讨的问题，因为圣经对此有很多教导。所以，首先我要说明的是，这整个讲道其实只有两个要点，并不是三个。

所以大家不要指望能提前结束，但确实是两个要点。第一个要点是：在这一章的中间部分，耶稣基督为我们设定了一个令人惊讶的奉献标准，这个标准令人惊讶到我们觉得难以接受。然后这是第一个要点，第二个要点我会展示如何通过福音逻辑来证明这种奉献是合理的。所以第一个要点，耶稣在这里为我们设定的一个令人惊讶的奉献标准；然后第二个要点，他是如何用福音逻辑来论证这一点的。

## 庇护制度与耶稣的惊人标准 / The Patronage System and Jesus' Astonishing Standard

He says, it says, then Jesus said to his host, now who's the host? Jesus has been invited into the home of a very prominent man. It doesn't tell us that in the part that we read, but it's in the very beginning of the chapter.

Jesus was invited to a big supper with lots of guests at a prominent home. And you see verse 7, it says, when he noticed the guests were picking places of honor at the table. So this was a typical supper in which people were trying to sit as close to the host as possible.

And then Jesus says, when you give a luncheon or dinner, he says this to the host, do not invite your friends, your brothers, your relatives, or your rich neighbors. That's who's there. Now, to understand what's going on, we have to give you some little background here.

The Greco-Roman world operated on the patronage system. This isn't totally alien because there's plenty of parts of the world that still do. The patronage system went like this.

In every community, there were certain prominent wealthy individuals. And if you want to do improve your station in life, move up at all. You had to make one of those people your patron.

If that person was your patron, that person gave you loans, gave you gifts, opened doors for you. But then you were part of their network. Patrons had networks of favorites.

And a favorite was somebody who got favors from the patron. And the patronage network of favorites meant that patronage could get a lot of things done in a community because you had all these people that owed you. So you always got breaks on things, you always got things got done.

Patrons could get a lot of things done in the community because your favorites would grease the slides, political favors, that kind of thing. When you had these suppers, that was what was going on. At the suppers, the people were trying to meet each other.

You either were trying to sustain your place in life by the patrons and the favorites were getting together to sustain their relationship, or you're trying to get new ones. You're trying to meet new patrons. You were trying to move up the ladder.

And therefore, the people who came to a supper were extremely important. You had to have rich neighbors. You had to have people at least at your level of society or better.

And because of that, these were not just parties. They were extremely important. And they were extremely expensive.

But that was all right because you, through those parties, you had these supper parties. But you got the people there who you were already having deals, making deals with and people who you were trying to incorporate into your network. And therefore, the party paid off.

The party always paid for itself. It was very expensive, but a party paid for itself. It was fun.

It was extensive. It was expensive. But it was fun.

But it also paid for you. That was the system. Jesus Christ comes to this man who's a patron type.

And has the audacity to say, when you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends, or your brothers or relatives, or your rich neighbors, the people who are there. If you do, they will invite you back, and they will repay you. Of course, that's how the patronage system worked.

He says, but here's what I want. Here's what I want my disciples to do. When you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind, and you will be blessed.

Now, first of all, what is Jesus saying, and then secondly, what are the implications? First of all, what is he saying? At first sight, when you and I read it, it looks like he's saying, never have your friends over.

Okay? So, let's finish our sermon right there and let us pray. Jesus says, never have your friends over.

He says, it says so. When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or sisters. Instead, you have to invite the poor.

What's this? Now, you have to understand Semitic idioms. An idiom, as you all know, every language is an idiom, and an idiomatic expression makes sense to people inside the language, but when you translate it into another language, if that idiom doesn't operate in those other languages, then what actually happens is it makes no sense because you take it literally.

And therefore, if you take that literally, it doesn't make much sense, but if you would like another example of the same idiom later on in the chapter, in fact, 14 verse 26, Jesus says, you must hate your father and mother if you want to be my disciple. Same thing. Hate your father and mother and follow me, you say, oh, really?

What does that mean? Could it mean that Jesus was saying, you remember those ten commandments that went about in front? Forget that.

You think that's what he's saying? Can't it mean I was forgetting? No, of course not.

Well, what's he saying? It's an idiom, and what he's actually saying is, even though he says, follow me and hate your father and mother. What he really means is not that you shouldn't love your father and mother, nor is he saying you love your father and mother too much, or you can love your father too much.

All he's saying is, you have to love me way more, far more, massively more, so much so that your love for me makes your love for your father and mother look like hate. So when the idiom says, don't love your father and mother love me, what it really means is love me far more, not that you shouldn't love your father and mother. And when it says, don't give parties for your friends, don't do the things necessary to maintain your place in life, don't do recreation, don't do entertainment, don't ever go out to eat.

Not buy nice clothes so that you're able to maintain your place in society. Those are all equivalents for today, what these sufferers were, equivalents for today. He's not saying don't do that.

He's saying, you're giving to charity and ministry. You're giving to ministry by which you give people spiritual life, so people find faith. You're giving to charity so people get physical life because they're fed when they're hungry.

You're giving to ministry and charity should be massively more than the money you spend on, entertainment, recreation, your nice clothes, your vacations, all that is really what these sufferers represented. They didn't have vacations, that this was their vestivities. That's what he's saying, not that you should never have, you should never spend any money on yourself, but the money you give to ministry and charity ought to be just massively bitter.

More. What does that mean? That's what he's saying.

那么首先，让我们来看这段话中的惊人标准。他说："于是耶稣对那请他吃饭的人说：'你办宴席，请你的朋友、兄弟、亲属或富有的邻居吗？'"当时谁在场呢？耶稣被邀请参加一个重要的晚宴，宴会上有很多客人。

从这章的开头部分我们可以知道，耶稣是被一位很有名望的人家邀请去赴宴。然后我们看到第7节说：“他看见那些请客的如何殷勤地为他们安排座位。”当时的情况是这样的：在古代宴会中，人们会尽量坐在主人旁边以示尊敬和亲近。接着耶稣对这位东道主说：“你办宴席的时候，不要邀请你的朋友、兄弟、亲属或富有的邻居。

现在我们来了解一下背景信息。在古希腊罗马世界里，运作着一种赞助人制度。这种制度虽然不完全陌生，因为在世界上还有很多地方仍然存在类似的制度。赞助人制度是这样的： 在每个社区中，总会有一些显赫的富裕人士。

如果你想提高自己的社会地位或晋升，就必须成为其中一位人的赞助人。如果你成为了某位赞助人的赞助人，那么这位赞助人会为你提供贷款、赠送礼物，并为你打开通往成功的大门。但作为回报，你也会成为他们网络的一部分。赞助人会有自己的一群受宠的人。

有人喜欢的是那些从庇护者那里得到好处的人。庇护者的宠臣网络意味着，庇护者在社区里能办成很多事情，因为有这些欠他们情的人。所以你总是能得到一些优惠，事情总能顺利进行。庇护者能在社区里办成很多事，因为他们有宠臣来打通关节，比如政治上的好处。

当你举办晚宴时，这就是在发生的事情。在晚宴上，人们试图相互认识。要么是为了维持自己在社会中的地位而与庇护者保持关系，宠臣们则在维护他们之间的联系；要么是为了结识新的庇护者，提升自己的地位。因此，参加晚宴的人非常重要。

你需要有富裕的邻居，至少是和你处于同一社会阶层或更高层次的人。正因为如此，这些晚宴不仅仅是聚会。它们非常重要，并且非常昂贵。但这没关系，因为通过这些聚会，你可以举办晚宴招待那些你已经打交道、正在建立关系的人以及试图纳入你的网络中的人。

因此，晚宴总是值得的。晚宴总是能自我回报。虽然很贵，但晚宴是值得的，因为它既有趣又实用。它规模宏大，成本高昂，但非常有趣。

但它也为你带来了好处。这就是系统。耶稣基督来到一个庇护者类型的人面前， 竟有胆量说：当你举办午餐或晚餐时，不要邀请你的朋友、兄弟、亲戚或者富有的邻居。如果你这样做，他们就会回请你们，并且会偿还你。

当然，这就是庇护系统的运作方式。他接着说：但我要告诉你们的是，我的门徒应该怎么做。当你举办宴会时，要邀请贫穷的、残疾的、瘸腿的和瞎眼的人，这样你才会得到祝福。现在，首先我们要弄清楚耶稣说了什么，然后其次要考虑其含义。

首先，他到底在说什么？乍一看，当我们读到这段话时，可能会觉得耶稣的意思是不要请朋友来家里。好的，那么我们的布道就到这里结束吧，请祷告。耶稣说，不要请朋友来家里。

他说的是，当你举办午宴或晚宴时，不要邀请你的朋友或兄弟姐妹。相反，你应该邀请穷人。这是什么意思？现在你们必须理解希伯来语的成语。

正如你们所知，每种语言都有自己的成语，成语在本语言中是有意义的，但当翻译成另一种语言时，如果那种成语在其他语言中不起作用，那么它就会变得毫无意义，因为你会把它字面上地理解。因此，如果你字面地去理解，这就不怎么合乎逻辑。但是，如果你们稍后在这一章里再看一个类似的成语例子，在14章26节，耶稣说：“你若爱我，就不要爱你的父亲和母亲。”意思是一样的。

你说，哦，真的吗？那是什么意思？难道耶稣的意思是，你还记得那些十条诫命吗？把它们忘了吧。

你觉得他是在这么说吗？不，当然不是。那么他在说什么呢？这是一个成语，实际上他的意思是，虽然他说要跟随我并且不爱父母。

他真正想表达的并不是你不应该爱你的父亲和母亲，也不是说你太爱你的父亲了。所有他要表达的只是，你必须爱我远远更多、大大更多，以至于你对我的爱比你对你父亲和母亲的爱还要多，甚至看起来像是恨。所以当经文说不要爱你的父亲和母亲，而是要爱我时，它真正想说的是你要比我更爱他们，并不是让你不爱你的父亲和母亲。同样地，当它说不要为朋友设宴、不要做维持你社会地位的事、不要娱乐、不要外出吃饭。

不要买好的衣服以保持你在社会中的地位。这些都是今天的等价物，就像这些受苦的人一样，它们是今天的等价物。他并不是在说你不应该这样做。他是在说，你在慈善和事工中奉献。

通过你的奉献，你给予人们精神上的生命，使他们找到信仰；你在慈善中奉献，使人们获得物质上的生活，因为他们饥饿时得到了食物。你在慈善和事工中的奉献应当远远超过你在娱乐、休闲、漂亮衣服、假期等方面花费的钱。所有这些都代表了那些受苦的人，他们没有假期，那是因为这是他们的生活方式。这就是他要说的，并不是说你永远不应该花钱给自己，而是你在慈善和事工上的奉献应该大大超出。

**这意味着什么？这就是他在说什么。**

## 牺牲性奉献：优先而非可选 / Sacrificial Giving: Priority Not Optional

What are the implications of that? The implications are that you're giving to ministry and charity must have a priority and it must be sacrificial. Now think about this now.

By the way, I've never understood the implications of this passage until the last couple of weeks getting ready to preach it to you. First of all, he's talking about priority. When he says, love, hate your father and mother and love me, he's not saying you shouldn't love your father and mother.

He's saying as you need to love me more, I'm the priority. If you have to choose between me and your parents, you must choose me, isn't that what he's saying? Doesn't Jesus say that?

Yes, of course he is. Now what is he saying here? Same thing.

He's actually saying, you're giving needs to be a necessity. You're giving to ministry and charities to be a necessity. It's actually optional and negotiable is the money you spend on yourself.

Switch it. Right now, for most of us, we have certain financial goals. We have certain things, lifestyle goals.

There are certain ways in which we want to live. There's vacations we want to take, there's clothes we want to buy, there's things we want to do. And if we have enough money to do that and to give to ministry and charity, then we do.

But that's the optional whereas spending money on you, that's the priority. That's the necessity. But it's, Jesus says, switch them.

---

这有什么影响呢？影响是你的奉献必须优先于其他事情，并且必须是牺牲性的。

现在想想这个。顺便说一句，在我准备向你们讲这段经文的前几天，我才真正理解了它的含义。首先，他是在谈论优先权的问题。当他说到爱我甚于爱你的父亲和母亲时，他并不是让你不爱你的父亲和母亲。

他只是在说，当你需要比我更爱我的时候，我是首要的。如果你必须在我和你父母之间做出选择，你必须选择我，对吧？耶稣不是这么说吗？当然，他是这样说的。

那么在这里他又说了什么呢？同样的意思。他实际上是在说，你们的奉献应该是出于必要的。你们给教会和慈善机构的捐款也应该是一种必要的行为。

而花在自己身上的钱则是可选的、可以商量的。要改变这种观念。对我们大多数人来说，目前我们都有一定的财务目标。有某些生活方式的目标。

我们希望以某种方式生活。我们想要去度假，买衣服，做一些事情。如果我们有足够的钱去做这些事并且还能给教会和慈善机构捐款，那我们就这么做。但这是可选的，而花在自己身上的钱才是优先级。

是必要的。耶稣说，要反过来。

## 主的牛犊总是死了 / The Lord's Calf Always Dies

Some years ago, there was a British farmer who raised livestock. And he had a cow who was pregnant. He was very happy about that.

Because he actually had enough livestock on the farm for his needs, to produce the things he needed. And therefore, he was going to be able to sell that calf, once the calf was born and it would grow up. He was going to sell the calf and make a tidy profit.

But to his joy, the cow had two calves, twins. Which meant he was going to get twice as much money from the sale when he sold them and he was very excited. And he came into his wife and he had a sort of magnanimous moment.

And he says, you know, he says, honey, you know, we're Christians and we go to the church. And you know what, when these two calves grow up and I sell them, I'm going to give half the proceeds to the Lord. Half the proceeds are going to go to the church.

And to sell the two calves, I'm going to get, you know, X amount of money and the amount of money I get from one, we'll go to the Lord and the rest, we'll keep ourselves. And she says, that's wonderful. How spiritual.

Several weeks later he walks in to the house, very, very sad in his face. She says, what's wrong? He says, oh, the Lord's calf died.

You know, they got sick, but the one got better and the other one didn't get better and it died. And she says, that's interesting. She says, I didn't remember that we designated one of those calves to be the Lord.

Oh, no. He says, almost from the beginning, I said, that's the Lord's calf right there. And that's the one that died.

What a shame. Now at the point of the story is, it's always the Lord's calf that dies. In other words, there's certain clothes we want to buy, there's certain vacations we want to have, there's certain trips we want to take, there's certain ways, there's certain places we want to live.

And that's the priority. And if we have enough money to give for charity and ministry, we will. And if there's a problem and we're pinched, that's where we take it out of.

We take it out of the charity and ministry and Jesus says, I want you to switch those. I want you to take it out of your own hide. Which means the implication of this is not just that your giving has to have a priority but also it needs to be sacrificial.

This passage goes along with all the rest of the passages in the Bible on giving. In the Old Testament, the standard forgiving of believers was very clear, 10% tithe. There was tithe.

Oh, it just says, 10% of your income you give to the Levites, to the Tabernacle, to the poor, to ministry and to charity. However, when you get to the New Testament, there is one place where Jesus actually says you should tithe. It's actually in Luke 11 verses 42 and 43 where he's talking to the Pharisees about how they tithe.

And he says, you should do that. That's right. So Jesus is not against the tithe.

And yet almost nowhere else in the New Testament does the tithe even get mentioned. Instead, we've got statements like this, 2 Corinthians 8, where Paul is telling, he's trying to get the Corinthian Christians to give money to the poor in Jerusalem. And he reminds them that the Macedonian Christians are already given.

And he says in verse 3, they gave as much as they were able and beyond their abilities. What does that mean? See, when we say, oh, I'd like to give more but I can't afford to give what you really mean is I can't afford to give without sacrificing.

But that's the whole point. I believe in the Old Testament, you have tithe, 10%, that's the standard of giving. And Jesus is saying, that's fine, that's a fine place to start.

But he says, basically, what the New Testament is saying, this is the real way you know you're giving enough. It's got to hurt. It means there's got to be sacrifices made.

It means there are things you can't do because you're giving. There's places you can't go because you're giving. You're giving so much.

He's got to be sacrifice. That's the standard. And that's what Jesus is saying.

And it's an amazing to go to a patron and to say, I don't want you to throw a supper and invite your rich neighbors and your friends. I want you to invite the poor. You realize when you threw a supper for your own social class where all the patroning things were going on, when you threw that party, that was expensive, but it paid for yourself.

That's how deals were made. That's, you know, it was a way of maintaining your business relationships, basically. So when you gave a meal, like the typical way, Jesus said, there's a way for you to spend your money that you get your money back.

They repay you. But if you were actually to throw a big feast and invite the poor and the crippled in the lame in the blind, that would just be money out the door. In other words, Jesus is saying one kind of use of your money is not sacrificial and one kind is, and that's what I want, sacrifice.

Now, does this seem unreasonable? It's pretty shocking. As I look at it, it makes me certainly think about myself, and I wrestle with it, too.

I'm certainly not up here saying, well, I've got this together, and why don't you? But I think we all need to stand under the text and look at it. This passage is seldom looked at as a stewardship passage, but over the years I've come to see what this means.

John Newton, the guy who wrote the old Anglican minister in the 18th century wrote amazing grace in all those hymns, he found this passage very troubling. And he said, all I can see is, it says, no matter how I slice it, I know Jesus doesn't mean it literally that you don't ever see your friends or anything like that. But no matter how I read it, it means I should be giving away a lot more money than I am.

All right, unreasonable? Not if you understand the gospel. I'd like to show you three ways in which Jesus uses the gospel to help you see that this kind of use of your money is eminently reasonable.

It's a long passage, and I'd just like to show you there's three speeches. In the very beginning, he speaks to all the guests from verse 8 to 11, and then in the middle he speaks to the hosts from verses 12 to 14, and then at the end he actually speaks to one smug guest and tells the great story of the parable, the great banquet, and at the end of every one of these speeches, he shows us some way in which the gospel helps us understand why it's very reasonable to give sacrifice. Today is Giving Tuesday, and we want you to know about a special opportunity we have this year.

As you may know, gospel and life supports Redeemer City to City, a ministry dedicated to growing gospel movements in cities around the world through church planting. City to City was co-founded by Tim Keller, and he cared deeply about this mission. And this coming year at a 2026 training event in Kenya, City to City will help train, coach, and support two cohorts of 20 pastors planting churches all over Africa.

This Giving Tuesday, we have a goal to raise $150,000 to help sponsor the church planters attending this training intensive in Nairobi, Kenya, so that City to City can help and support these church planters to start churches across Africa. This work is vital to the spread of the gospel in African cities from Kampala to Legos to Johannesburg. So as you think about how you may give on Giving Tuesday, please consider making a gift to gospel in life.

Every dollar we receive today will go directly to the work City to City is doing to help start new churches in Africa in 2026. To make a gift today, visit gospelonlife.com slash Tuesday, again as gospelonlife.com slash Tuesday. And thank you for your generous and faithful support of this ministry.

几年前，有一位英国农民养牲畜。他有一头怀孕的牛，他非常高兴。

因为他实际上有足够的牲畜来满足自己的需要，生产所需的东西，并且因此能够卖掉那头小牛犊，长大后卖掉它也能赚一笔。但他很高兴的是，这头母牛生了双胞胎。**这意味着当他卖掉它们时，他会得到两倍的钱，他非常兴奋。**于是他走进妻子面前，有了一个慷慨的念头。

他说：“你知道吗？我们是基督徒，我们去教会。当这两头小牛长大后卖出去，我要把一半的钱给主。一半的钱会捐给教会。

” 为了卖掉这两头小牛，他会得到X金额的钱，一头小牛的钱我们会给主，剩下的钱我们自己留着。她回答说：“太好了，真有精神。” 几周后，他走进家里，脸上带着非常悲伤的表情。她说：“怎么了？

”他说：“哦，主的小牛死了。”你知道的，它们生病了，但一头恢复了，另一头没好就死了。她说：“这很有趣。”她说：“我没想到我们指定了一头小牛给主。

” 哦，不。他几乎从一开始就说，那是主的牛犊，就是那只死掉的。真是可惜。故事到了关键点时，总是主的牛犊会死。

换句话说，我们总有一些想要买的衣服、想要去度假的地方、想要去旅行的目的地、想要居住的方式和地点。这些是我们的优先事项。如果我们有足够的钱可以用来慈善和事工，我们会这样做的。如果遇到问题而手头紧了，那我们就从那里拿。

我们从慈善和事工中拿，耶稣却说，我希望你们要调换一下顺序。我希望你们先从自己身上拿。**这意味着这个意思不仅仅是你的奉献要有优先级，还需要是牺牲性的。**这段经文与圣经中关于奉献的其他所有经文都是一致的。

在旧约中，信徒的标准奉献是十分之一的什一税。确实有什一税。只是说，你们收入的十分之一要给利未人、会幕、穷人、事工和慈善。然而到了新约，耶稣实际上只提到一次应该缴纳什一税的地方。

这在路加福音11章42节和43节中，他正在对法利赛人谈论他们如何缴纳什一税。他说，你们要这样做是对的。所以耶稣并不是反对什一税。然而，在新约的其他地方，什一税几乎从未被提及。

相反，我们有像哥林多后书8章这样的陈述，保罗正试图让哥林多基督徒给耶路撒冷的穷人捐款。他提醒他们马其顿的基督徒已经捐了款。他在3节中说，他们捐得比自己能负担的还要多。这意味着什么？

你看，当我们说，我想捐更多但付不起时，真正意思是我不愿意牺牲就捐不出去。但这正是重点所在。我认为在旧约中，有什一税，10%，这是奉献的标准。耶稣说，这很好，这是一个很好的起点。

但他基本上就是在说新约的意思，这就是你知道你已经付出足够的真正方式：这必须是痛苦的。**这意味着必须要有牺牲。****这意味着因为你付出了，所以有些事情你不能做；因为你付出了，所以有些地方你不能去。**你要付出这么多。

他必须是牺牲。这是标准。而耶稣正是这么说的。当你去找赞助人时，说我不希望你请客宴请你的富有的邻居和朋友，我希望你邀请穷人。

你知道当你为自己的社交圈举办宴会时，其实那是一笔昂贵的交易，但最终却为自己赚到了回报。那是维持商业关系的方式。所以当像通常那样请客时，耶稣说有一种花钱的方式可以让你得到回报。他们会让你偿还。

但如果真的宴请穷人、残疾者和瞎子，那就是钱打了水漂。换句话说，耶稣说的是，一种金钱的使用方式不是牺牲，而另一种是，这才是我想要的——牺牲。这听起来合理吗？这确实很惊人。

当我审视这段话时，它让我不得不反思自己，并且我也在与之斗争。当然，我不是站在这里说我已经完全搞定了，为什么你们没有呢？但我认为我们都应该站在经文之下，仔细看看。这一段经文很少被当作管理钱财的经文来看待，但多年来我逐渐理解了它的含义。

约翰·牛顿，18世纪的老英格兰牧师，在那些赞美诗中写下了《奇妙恩典》，他发现这段经文非常困扰人。他说，无论我怎么解读它，我都明白耶稣并不是字面上的意思——你永远不要见你的朋友之类的话。但无论如何读，它都意味着我要比现在多捐出很多钱。好的，不合理吗？

如果你理解了福音，就不会觉得不合理。我想向你们展示耶稣是如何用福音帮助你看清，这种使用金钱的方式是完全合理的。这是一段较长的经文，我只想指出其中有三个演讲。在最开始的部分，他从第8节到第11节对所有宾客说话；然后在中间部分，他从第12节到第14节对主人讲话；最后，在结尾处，他对一个自满的客人进行了教导，并讲述了关于盛宴的精彩比喻故事。

在这三个演讲的每一个结尾，耶稣都向我们展示了福音如何帮助我们理解为什么献上牺牲是合理的。今天是“感恩星期二”，我们想让你知道今年有一个特别的机会。你可能已经知道了，《福音与生命》支持“复兴城市”事工，这是一个致力于通过教会植堂在世界各地推动福音运动的使命。“复兴城市”是由提姆·凯勒共同创立的，并且他对此使命非常关心。

明年，在肯尼亚的一次2026年培训活动中，“复兴城市”将帮助培训、指导和支持两批共20位牧者，他们在非洲各地植堂。今天是“感恩星期二”，我们的目标是在内罗毕筹集15万美元来资助参加这次密集培训的教会植堂者，这样“复兴城市”就能支持这些植堂者在非洲各地开始新的教会。这项工作对于福音在非洲城市的传播至关重要，从坎帕拉到雷戈斯再到约翰内斯堡。因此，在你思考如何在“感恩星期二”捐款时，请考虑向《福音与生命》捐赠。

我们今天收到的每一美元都将直接用于支持“复兴城市”2026年在非洲开始新教会的工作。要进行捐赠，请访问gospelonlife.com/Tuesday，再次输入gospelonlife.com/Tuesday。感谢你对这个事工慷慨而忠心的支持。现在，让我们听听提姆·凯勒博士今天的其余信息。

## 福音逻辑：新的内在灵性财富 / Gospel Logic: New Inner Spiritual Wealth

Now, here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's message. Here's the first one.

In verses 7 through 11, 7, we already saw this. He sees how the guests are picking places of honor at the table. And then he says this, when someone invites you to a feast, don't take the higher, the more honored seats, let somebody there will ask you to move, and then you're humiliated.

Take the lower seats so somebody asks you, oh come on up here closer to me. Now at one level, this is just practical. What he's really saying is don't be the kind of person that suits your own horn.

If you suit your own horn, people are not going to like you. And so the irony is if you're a self-promoter, you're always pushing yourself, look how good I am. I know how to do this.

I know how to do this. Basically, the people who most promote themselves very often don't get promoted because everybody else presents them. So what he's saying is be modest and by the quality of your life, if people will see your quality and they'll speak well of you and that's better than if you speak well of yourself.

There's a lot of proverbs in chapter 26 and 27 that say the same thing, but Jesus is not just saying this. He's not just being pragmatic because when you get to verse 11, he is taking this principle and he's showing that this is the core of spiritual reality. He says in verse 11, everyone, not just sometimes it's smart to not suit your own horn.

Verse 11, he's getting cosmic here and he says everyone who exalts himself will be humbled and he who humbles himself will be exalted. Now I would not mind at all to preach an entire sermon just on that text because what he's trying to say is true in every single area of life, but ultimately at the core of spirituality it's true and here's what that means. If you go to God and say, I deserve acceptance, you will be rejected because that shows you do not know what's in your own heart.

But if you go to God and say I deserve rejection, please forgive me, you will get acceptance. And that's the gospel. Religion says you go to God and say I deserve acceptance, look at all the good deeds.

But the gospel says if you say you deserve acceptance, you will get rejection, if you say you deserve rejection, which means if with God you take the lower seat, he will accept you. He will exalt you because the gospel is he who humbles himself will be exalted and he who exalts himself will be humbled. If you exalt yourself, you'll be humbled because that's salvation by works.

If you humble yourself, you'll be exalted because that's salvation by grace. But look at this term exalted, what does it mean that God will exalt you? James 4, 10, 1 Peter 5, 6 says if you humble yourself under the mighty hand of God, he will exalt you.

He will lift you up. Jesus says to the Pharisees in John 12 verse 43, he says, you love the praise of men more than the praise of God. And there it is.

If you have the praise of God in your heart, if you've repented, if you've taken the lower seat as it were with God, and he has exalted you and he has received you and he's accepted you by grace, your heart is filled with the praise of God, a sense of the light in you, a sense of his love, you know what that means? You have a new spiritual inner wealth, you have a new wealth inside, you have a real riches, you have real value, you have real security, and you no longer look at your external wealth the same, do you? Because money, if you don't have God in the center of your life, money is more than money.

It's security, it's self-esteem, I've got money, so I know, I'm important, I've got money, so I know I'm secure. If you don't have God in the center of your life, if you don't have the praise of God in the center of your life, you're like these people scrambling to get to the top, always trying to connect to people who are a little better off than you, trying to get more money, trying to get more security, trying to get more prosperity, trying to get more status, but Jesus says, my disciples have the praise of God in the center of their being, they've been exalted, and as a result they're not scrambling. You know what, there's something very balanced about verses 8, 9, and 10, what he's actually saying there is, I don't want my people, I don't want my disciples to be passionate about getting up the ladder and getting admitted into those inner circles.

That should not drive your life, but if somebody invites you in, fine, he's, I'm not against Christians being successful, it shouldn't be the passion of your life, if it happens, that's great, but you should have such an incredible inner spiritual wealth that it makes it easy for you to give away your external wealth because now your external wealth money is just money to you, it's nothing more. So that's the first way in which the logic of the gospel makes giving away your money in radical portions more sensible, but that's not all, secondly, the second speech we already looked at, but we didn't look at the end of it. It's in verse 12 to 14, and he's telling the host, don't invite these people, invite the poor, the cripple, the lame in the blind, and you'll be blessed, and then he says, although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.

这是第一条信息。在7至11节中，7节我们已经看到这一点。他看到客人们如何挑选餐桌上的尊贵位置，然后他说："有人请你赴宴，不要抢着坐尊贵的位置，等别人请你挪动一下，你反而会受羞辱。" 相反，要谦卑地坐在低处的位置，好让别人请你靠近一些。

“来啊，到这里来和我更近一点。”从一个层面来说，这是很实际的建议。他真正想说的是：不要只想着满足自己的虚荣心。如果你总是满足自己的虚荣心，认为自己了不起，那么人们就不会喜欢你。

所以讽刺的是，如果你是一个自我吹嘘的人，总是在展示自己的好，说“看我多么优秀”，你知道怎么做，但往往那些最擅长自我宣传的人反而不会被提升，因为别人会替他们展示。所以他建议要谦逊。通过你生活的质量，如果人们看到你的品质并称赞你，这比你自己夸耀自己要好得多。第26章和27章中有很多箴言也说同样的道理，但耶稣不只是在讲这个道理。

他不只是为了实用才这样说的，因为到了11节时，他已经把这个原则提升到精神现实的核心层面。“所以，每一个人都不要只想着抬高自己，最终会被人贬低；而那些谦卑的人，反而会被提升。” 我完全愿意整篇讲道都围绕这一段经文，因为耶稣在这里所要表达的真理适用于生活的方方面面。但从根本上说，在灵性上这是真的。

**这意味着：如果你去上帝面前说“我配得接受”，你就会被拒绝，因为你没有真正认识自己的内心；而如果你去上帝面前说“我配得拒绝，请饶恕我”，你反而会得到接纳。**这就是福音的信息。宗教教导人们去上帝面前说“我配得接受”，看我做了多少好事。但福音说，如果你声称自己配得接纳，就会遭到拒绝；如果你承认自己不配得接纳，也就是说你愿意在神面前坐低一点的位置，祂会接受你，并且提升你。

因为福音告诉我们：「谦卑的人必升为高」（马太福音 23:12），而「自夸的必降为地下」（箴言 29:23）。如果你自夸，就会被贬抑；因为这是靠行为得救。但如果你自卑，就会被提升；因为这是靠恩典得救。然而看看这个“提升”这个词是什么意思？

神会如何提升你？雅各书 4:10 和彼得前书 5:6 都说：「你们要就近神，神就必亲近你们；你们要自卑，神就必升高你们。」祂会把你举起来。耶稣对法利赛人说（约翰福音 12:43）：“人若爱世人的赞美过于爱神的赞美，他所结的果子就不能长存。

”正是在这里。如果你心中有神的赞美，如果你已经悔改，并且像在神面前坐低一点的位置一样谦卑自己，祂已经提升你、接纳你并以恩典接受你；你的内心充满了对神的赞美，感受到内心的光亮和祂的爱。这代表什么？这意味着你拥有了新的属灵财富，内在充满真实的丰富，**真正的价值，以及真正的安全感；不再像从前那样看待外在的财富了，不是**吗？

因为金钱，如果你不在生命中以神为中心，它就不仅仅是金钱。它是为了安全感，为了自尊心，我有钱，所以我明白自己很重要。我有钱，所以我知道自己很安全。如果你没有上帝在生命中心的位置，如果没有上帝的赞美在你生命中占据核心地位，你就像是那些拼命往上爬的人，总是试图与比自己稍好一点的人建立联系，努力获取更多的钱、更多的安全感、更多的繁荣和更高的社会地位。

但耶稣说：“我的门徒会以上帝的赞美为中心，他们已经被提升，因此不会盲目追求。” 事实上，第8节到第10节之间有一种非常平衡的感觉，他实际上说的是：我不想让我的人，不想让我门徒的热情集中在攀爬阶梯上，进入那些内部圈子。这不应该成为你生活的驱动力，但如果你被邀请进去，那也没问题。我并不反对基督徒取得成功，但这不应是你生命的热情所在。

但如果它发生了，那就太好了。更重要的是，你应该拥有如此丰富的内在灵性财富，以至于很容易就能舍弃你的外部财富，因为现在对你来说，金钱只是金钱而已，并没有什么特别的意义。所以这就是福音逻辑让你在极端程度上舍弃钱财更有道理的第一个方面，但这还不是全部。第二部分我们已经讨论过，但没有提到结尾部分。

## 福音逻辑：保证的未来财富 / Gospel Logic: Guaranteed Future Wealth

Again, I would love to spend a whole sermon on this, but I'll just tell you this. You know what he's saying? He says, here's the problem with living life the way Jesus says, you ought to live.

You should be pouring yourself out for people. You should be letting people into your life. You should be caring for people who are troubled.

You should be going the extra mile to be friends to people who other people don't want to be friends to. You should be giving a tremendous amount of your money away. You should be very involved in ministry and charity.

You know what that's going to mean? It means you're going to feel like, sometimes you're going to feel like I'm missing out. Other people have the money to do this.

They go here. They do this. I'm missing out.

I'm not going to have this experience. I'm not going to go on that trip. I'm never going to be able to live like that.

I'm missing out. Jesus says, no, because of the resurrection, don't think you're missing out at all because your future is not an ethereal future in which we're disembodied consciousnesses, kind of floating around through all eternity, you're going to get bodies. The kingdom of God is a feast.

The future kingdom of God is a feast. You're going to get bodies. Jesus Christ, the risen Jesus Christ was there.

They could feel Him. He ate a fish. And what that means is in the future, you're not going to miss out on anything.

David Martin Lloyd-Jones, the great British preacher in the 20th century, mid-20th century, once preached a sermon on 1 Corinthians 15 about the resurrection. And it moved me very much. It's really sank deep into my heart.

I have an old tape of it somewhere, and I have notes that I took on it. And here's what he says near the end. He says, and this is paraphrase, but these are my notes of what he said.

He says, this is 1 Corinthians 15 about the resurrection of the body. He says, the kingdom of God is a feast. You are going to have new bodies.

Romans 8.11 says, if the Spirit that raised Jesus Christ is in you, He will also give life to your mortal body through the Spirit in you. He says, this is Lloyd-Jones speaking. He says, you know as you begin to get older, you begin to think that your enemy is your body.

But no, the enemy is in your body, and it will be driven out someday. You're going to get new bodies, resurrected bodies, healed bodies. Jonathan Edwards, the great New England minister, once said, right now in this body, this version of our fallen body, our body subject to sin and disease and death, you've got five senses, right?

Five senses? But what about, maybe in our new bodies, we'll have 100? There may be a thousand or 10,000, which means right now you are compared to what you're going to be like in the resurrection.

You're just a vegetable compared to what you will be. Your future self. And then he went on and said, Jesus Christ, the risen Christ ate a fish.

Your future glory is not an ethereal esoteric form of impersonal consciousness. You will eat in the kingdom of God. You will love.

You will hug. You will be hugged in the kingdom of God. You will sing.

You'll dance. Your feet will touch the ground. Your feet.

You'll eat and you'll sing and you'll love and you'll, in realms of power and glory and satisfaction that you cannot now imagine, we will walk in the kingdom of God. We will not float over the kingdom of God. We will march in the kingdom of God.

We will eat and drink with the Son of Man. Are you afraid that you're going to miss out on some aspect of life because you are giving so much away, you're giving so much of your time away, you're giving so much of your money away? You will not miss out on anything.

Why? Because of the resurrection. They will not repay you in this life is what he's saying.

But the resurrection, and that makes it very sensible to give away. You won't miss out on anything. Lastly, so see what he's saying.

He's saying, here's why you can give away your money. First of all, you've got a new internal wealth according to the gospel. Secondly, you've got a guaranteed future wealth according to the gospel.

它在第12节到第14节中，耶稣对主人说：不要邀请那些富人、健全的人和健康的，要邀请贫穷的、残疾的和瞎眼的，你将被祝福；然后他又说：虽然他们无法回报你，但在义人的复活时你会得到回报。我真的很想单独讲一整场关于这一点的道，但我会告诉你这个。他实际上在说什么？他说：按照耶稣所说的那样生活，有一个问题。

你应该为别人付出自己。你应该让别人进入你的生活中。你应该关心那些有困扰的人。你应该主动去结交那些别人不愿意结交的朋友，应该慷慨地捐出你大量的金钱。

你应该积极参与到事工和慈善活动中。你知道**这意味着什么吗？这表示有时你会觉得自己在错过一些东西。**其他人有能力和资源去做这些事情。

他们在这里做这件事，在那里做那件事，而我却觉得错过了。我不会有这种经历。我不会去那个旅行。我永远无法过上那样的生活。

我觉得自己在错过。但耶稣说，不，并不是这样，因为复活的缘故，你不必觉得自己在错过任何东西，因为你未来的生命不是一种虚无缥缈的存在，我们只是灵魂飘荡到永恒的未来。你会拥有新的身体。神国是一个盛宴。

神国的未来是一个盛宴，你会拥有新的身体。耶稣基督，复活中的耶稣基督，就在那里。他们能感受到祂。祂吃了一条鱼。

**这意味着在将来，你不会错过任何东西。**20世纪中叶的伟大英国传道人戴维·马丁·刘易斯·琼斯曾经在他的讲道《哥林多前书15章：复活的身体》中提到这些内容。他的讲道深深打动了我。我有一盘旧磁带和一些笔记，上面记录了他的讲道要点。

他说，在接近结尾时，他这样说道（这是我的笔记的概括）： 他说，《哥林多前书15章》是关于身体复活的内容。他说，神国是一个盛宴，你会拥有新的身体。《罗马书8:11》说：“如果那叫基督从死里复活的灵住在你们心里，祂也必借着那灵使你们的生命与基督一同活。”他接着说，这是刘易斯·琼斯的话。

他说：随着你渐渐变老，你会开始觉得你的敌人是自己的身体。但是不，敌人是在你们的身体里，终有一天会被赶出去。你们将获得新的身体，复活的身体，痊愈的身体。伟大的新英格兰牧师约拿单·爱德华兹曾经说过，在这个身体里——我们堕落的身体，受罪、疾病和死亡所辖制的身体——你现在有五感。

五感？但也许在我们的新身体里，我们会拥有100种感觉呢？可能会有一千种或一万种，这就意味着现在你与复活时的你是多么的不同了。你现在就像一个蔬菜，相比未来的你。

然后他继续说，耶稣基督，复活中的基督吃过鱼。你们在神国里的荣耀不是一种虚无缥缈、抽象的概念性意识。你们将在神国里吃喝，在那里你们会相爱。你们会被拥抱，在神国里也会有人拥抱你们。

你们会在那里唱歌。你们会跳舞。你们的脚会触地，你们的脚。你们会吃，会唱，会爱，在权力和荣耀与满足感中，那是你们现在无法想象的领域，我们将在神国里行走。

我们将不会在神国上空飘浮，而是将行走在神国之中。你们将会与人子一起吃饭、喝酒。你是否害怕因为奉献了太多的时间和金钱而错过了生活的一部分？你不会错过任何东西。

为什么？因为复活的缘故。他说，在这一生中你们不会得到回报。但是复活，这使得奉献变得非常明智。

你不会错过任何东西。最后，看看他想说什么。他说，这就是你可以奉献的原因之一。首先，福音给你们带来了新的内在财富。

其次，福音保证了你们未来的财富。还有复活这件事，还有一个重要的事情，你需要看到耶稣基督的牺牲是获得宴会席位所必需的。

## 福音逻辑：基督为筵席的牺牲 / Gospel Logic: Christ's Sacrifice for the Feast

The resurrection, but one more thing, you need to see the sacrifice of Jesus Christ that was required for you to get into the feast. Look at this great banquet story. This is the last story.

And actually, you could easily, again, preach a whole sermon just on the parable and many people do. And Jesus is speaking to a smug guest at the banquet who hears him talking to the host and says in verse 15, he says, blessed is the man who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God. Now, this is one of those social climbing, scrambling guests.

And he clearly is sure he's going to be there. And Jesus decides, okay, if you think the kingdom of God is a feast, right? Let me tell you what the kingdom of God is really like.

He tells this parable to show this man how the kingdom of God's salvation really works. And the parable is, first, a great patron type person is throwing a huge feast. The word great there is the Greek word mega.

It's a mega feast. It's an incredible feast. Hundreds of guests, maybe thousands of guests, I don't know.

And he sends out his first invitation and his first invitation is come all is now ready. The first set of invitees, and their invitees that ordinarily come to one of these, their people of the social class of the, you know, the inviteer, they're too busy. They've got good reasons.

They're doing business deals. They got married. There's a good reasons, but they don't come.

And that master of the feast says, in that case, let's take the people who would never be qualified for a feast like this. Let's go to the people who actually shouldn't be here. And first, he sends them out, notice, to the urban poor.

Because first, he sends his servant out to the streets and the alleys, it says. And he brings in the poor and the crippled and the blind and the lame and they come in. But there's still seats open.

So then he sends them out to, it says at the very end, verse 25, go out to the roads and the country lanes and make them come in so that my house will be full. Roads and country lanes, in the Old King James Bible, it says the highways and the hedges. Because at this point, he's sending the servant out to the rural poor, to the people along country lanes who lived in the hedges along the lame.

And those people were very desperate. Many of them were robbers. They were dangerous.

They were desperate. And they were more destitute than the urban poor. And notice, for the rural poor, he actually says go out to them and go out to the roads and country lanes and make them come in.

And the commentators are always amazed at this text. It's a Greek word that really means drive them in, argue them in, debate with them, persuade them to come in because they're not going to be persuaded, why not? Because the kingdom of God that Jesus Christ is depicting for us is a full finished salvation.

See what the invitation is, come, all is now ready. That's salvation. Come, all is now ready.

Do you know what that means? The kingdom of God? If it's a feast, it's not a potluck dinner.

Potluck means you bring something. Jesus says absolutely not. The kingdom of God is finished.

There is nothing to prepare. There is nothing to purchase. There's nothing to cook.

It's all finished. You just have to receive a free and full salvation. No wonder the people out in the highways and hedges can't believe it.

The master says the servants, you're going to have to go out there and argue with them. They're never going to believe they're being invited to something like this. And I want you to see, because I think Jesus wants you to see, that that's you and me out there in the hedges.

We don't really believe the gospel of grace. We have to drive it in. Frankly, many, many of us are still in the hedges.

We still say, oh Lord, I know that somehow, if I live a good enough life, you'll bless me. That means you're still in the hedges. You have an understood the logic of the gospel, and we can't possibly come in.

We don't deserve it. That's right. We don't deserve it, because verse 24 says, I tell you, one of those men who were invited and turned down the invitation will get a taste of my banquet.

But verse 24 points me to Jesus, points us to Jesus, you know why? There's people on the outside, they're the proud, they're the ones who were too proud to come, and there's people on the inside, they were the humble. But why are we able to come in just with humility?

Why are we able to get a full, free banquet just because we're willing to say, oh Lord, I'm not qualified? It's not humility that earns that banquet. It's what Jesus Christ did on the cross.

At the end of, in Matthew 25, there's two parables. And each parable talks about judgment day. And in one parable, the Lord on judgment day says to some people, well done, good and faithful servant, enter into my feast, the joy of my yearmaster.

And to another set of people, in another parable, the Lord on judgment day says, depart from me, cursed into everlasting fire. Well done, good and faithful servant, come into the feast. But apart from me, he cursed, you have no taste of my feast.

Get out. Jesus was the one person who loved God with all his heart, soul, strength, and mind, loved his neighbor as himself, lived a perfect life. And at the end of his life, he should have heard God say to him, well done, good and faithful servant, enter into the joy of your master.

But instead, we know what he heard on the cross. Why did Jesus say, my God, my God, why has thou forsaken me? Because he was hearing in his soul, God say, depart from me, he cursed into everlasting fire.

He was thrown out. He was cast out, which is what we deserve, so we can be brought in. He heard, depart from me, he cursed into everlasting fire, so that we could hear when all we have to do is repent.

All we have to do is just say, oh, I'm not, you know, I'm unqualified. And God will say, well done, good and faithful servant, enter into the joy of your master. Why?

Because it's not our humility that earns the banquet, it's what Jesus Christ did. He was cast out so that we could be brought in. He sacrificed everything, and that's the final logic of the gospel, piece of the gospel that helps us with our giving.

When you realize that Jesus Christ sacrificed to give us life, you will start to say, how can I sacrifice to give other people life? I live by the sacrifice of Christ. It's because of his sacrifice that I live.

Now sacrifice your money to ministry so people spiritually live, to charity so people physically live who are hungry. By Jesus' sacrifice, you live now by your sacrifice, not of your blood, but of your money other people can live. And the more you see that you live by Christ sacrifice, the more reasonable it will be for you to give sacrificially.

So it's the inner wealth that we have, it's the guarantee of future wealth that we have because of what Jesus Christ did, though he was rich, he became poor, though he was an insider, he became an outsider, though he had the highest seat, he was thrown out of the feast, so that you could be brought in. And therefore, sacrificial giving is just reasonable. Let's wrestle with this together as a community.

Some of you are guests, probably, you don't even, I'm not obviously after your money because you don't even live here. Some of you, in fact, and here's the other thing I want you to know, we'll talk about this next week. I'm not here to say, you now because of this sermon, here's your application, give money to Redeemer.

First, a lot of you don't go to Redeemer, you're not members of Redeemer. I don't want you to think about that for a second. I want you to think, I'm asking, here's another minister asking me for money.

I want you to say, what should my attitude toward my money be in light of the gospel? And that's a frightening, frightening question to ask because as John Newton said, I really don't know how to quite get my hands, my head around what Jesus is saying here, but I just know this, I need to be giving a lot more than I am now, and I think that's right. Let's pray.

Our Father, help us to be conformed to the image of your Son, though he was rich, he became poor, though he was an insider, he was cast out. And when we see that, that has got to affect the way in which we think about our funds and about our money and about our lifestyle and about how we spend it, I pray, Lord, that you would enable us to, as a community, be famous for a generosity to each other and to the city. And I pray that you would more and more conform this into the image of your Son who came not to be served, but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many.

It's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Thanks for listening to Tim Keller on the Gospel and Life podcast.

看看这个伟大的筵席故事吧。这是最后一个故事。

实际上，仅就这个比喻，你也可以再讲一整场 sermon，很多人都这么做。耶稣正与一位自以为是的宴会客人交谈，这位客人听到主人和耶稣的对话后，在第15节说：“蒙福的是那要参加在神国筵席的人。”这是一位典型的攀爬者、努力往上爬的客人。他显然觉得自己肯定能进去。

于是耶稣决定告诉他：如果你认为神的国度就像一场盛宴，那么让我告诉你神的国度究竟是怎样的。耶稣讲了这个比喻来向这位客人展示神的救恩是如何运作的。这个比喻是这样的：首先，一位伟大的东道主正在举办一个超大的宴会。“伟大”这个词在希腊文中是“mega”，意思是超级大、非常壮观的盛宴。

可能有几百甚至上千位宾客。他先发出第一轮邀请，并说：“现在一切准备就绪。”通常情况下，受邀的人及其家人会因为忙碌而无法出席，比如他们正在做买卖或忙着结婚等，都有正当理由。但主人说：既然这样，那我们就去邀请那些本来没有资格参加这种盛宴的人。

于是他首先派人到城市贫民区去，请来穷人、残疾者、瞎子和瘸子，这些人来了之后还有一些座位空着。接着，他在最后一节（第25节）提到，要派仆人去大路和乡村小径上请人来，让我的房子坐满。在旧钦定本圣经中，这里说“大道和篱笆”。因为这时主人已经派人到乡间贫民区，请那些住在田野边篱笆旁的穷人和流浪者。

这些人非常需要帮助，其中很多人是盗贼，很危险。他们非常绝望，比城市里的穷人还要贫困。并且请注意，对于农村的穷人，他实际上说要到外面去，在道路上、在乡村小路上找到他们，请他们进来。注释家们总是对这段文字感到惊讶。

这是一个希腊词，真正意思是强迫他们进来，争论让他们进来，辩论说服他们进来，因为他们不会被说服。为什么呢？因为耶稣基督为我们描绘的天国是完全的救赎。看看这邀请是什么意思：来吧，一切都已经准备好了。

这就是救恩。来吧，一切都已经准备好了。你知道这意味着什么吗？天国？

如果这是一个宴会，那不是自助餐。自助餐意味着你得自带食物。耶稣说绝对不是这样。天国是完整的。

什么都不需要准备，不需要购买，也不需要烹饪。都已经完成了。你们只需要接受这份免费而完全的救恩。难怪那些在大路和田间的人无法相信这一点。

主人说仆人们，你们必须出去争论让他们进来。他们永远不会相信自己被邀请参加这样的宴会。我想让你看到，因为我认为耶稣希望你看到，那就是我们在田间的状况。我们真的不相信恩典福音。

我们必须强迫自己接受它。坦率地说，许多人都还在田间。我们仍然认为：主啊，我知道如果我过上足够好的生活，你会赐福给我。**这意味着你们仍在田间。**

你们已经理解了福音的逻辑，所以我们不可能进来。我们不配。没错，我们不配，因为第24节说：“我告诉你们，被邀请的人有一个是倒退的。” 但第24节指向耶稣，也指向我们，你知道为什么吗？

外面有骄傲的人，他们太骄傲而拒绝来；里面则有谦卑的人。但我们为什么只需要凭着谦卑就能进来呢？为什么我们愿意说“哦，主啊，我不配”就能得到一个丰盛、免费的筵席？这不是谦卑让我们得到了这个筵席。

而是因为耶稣基督在十字架上所做的一切。马太福音25章末尾有两个比喻，每个比喻都讲到审判日。在一个比喻中，审判日时主对一些人说：“你这又良善又忠心的仆人，来吧，享受我主人的喜乐。”而在另一个比喻中，主对另一些人说：“你们这些咒诅的人，离开我去吧，进入那永火里去。

”你这又良善又忠心的仆人，来享受我的筵席。但不靠我，他就咒诅他们，他们没有品尝过我的筵席。出去吧！耶稣是唯一一个全心爱神、灵魂和力量都爱邻舍的人，他过着完美的一生。

在他生命的尽头，本该听到神对他说：“你这又良善又忠心的仆人，来享受我主人的喜乐。” 但相反，我们知道他在十字架上听到了什么。“我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？”因为他内心听见了神说：“离开我去吧，你被咒诅进入永火。

” 他被赶出去了，被抛弃了，这是我们应该得到的结果，所以我们才能被带进来。他听到“离开我去吧，你被咒诅进入永火”，好让我们只需悔改就能听到神说：“你这又良善又忠心的仆人，来享受我主人的喜乐。” 为什么？因为不是我们的谦卑赢得了这个筵席，而是耶稣基督所做的。

他被赶出去，好让我们能进来；他舍弃了一切，这就是福音最终的逻辑，帮助我们理解奉献的部分。当你意识到耶稣基督为了给我们生命而牺牲时，你就会开始说：“我如何才能为别人的生命做出牺牲呢？”我是靠着基督的牺牲活着的。正是因为他的牺牲，我才得以存活。

现在，将你们的钱奉献给事工，使人们灵性上得以存活；奉献给慈善事业，使饥饿的人们得以身体上的存活。藉着耶稣的牺牲，你们现在是靠著自己的牺牲而活，并不是靠流血，而是靠著奉献金钱给别人而活。并且，你们越是明白自己是靠着基督的牺牲而活，就越会觉得慷慨奉献是合乎情理的。所以，我们内在的财富，是我们未来财富的保证，这一切都是因耶稣基督所做的一切。

虽然他富有，却成了贫穷；虽然他是局内人，却成了局外人；虽然他坐在高位上，却被赶出宴席，好让你们得以进来。因此，慷慨奉献是合乎情理的。让我们作为社区一起思考这个问题。有些人是客人，可能还不在这里定居，所以我并不明显地在追求你们的钱财。

事实上，还有一件事我想告诉你们，下周我们会再谈这个话题。我不是要因为这场讲道而要求你们现在就捐钱给赎罪会。首先，你们中很多人并没有来赎罪会，也不是赎罪会的成员。我希望你们不要一时冲动去想这些事情。

我只想问你们：在福音的光照下，我对金钱的态度应该是怎样的？这是一个令人害怕的问题，正如约翰·牛顿所说，我真的不知道该如何完全理解耶稣在这里所说的，但我只知道一件事，我现在需要比现在多得多地奉献，我认为这是正确的。让我们祷告。我们天父，帮助我们在你的儿子的形象上被塑造。

虽然他富有，却成了贫穷；虽然他是局内人，却被排斥在外。当我们看到这一点时，我们必须反思我们的资金、金钱、生活方式以及如何花费它们。主啊，请让我们作为一个社区，以彼此和这座城市慷慨著称。我祈求你使我们越来越像你的儿子，他来不是为了被服侍，而是去服侍，并且舍弃自己的生命作为许多人的赎价。
