## 两种需要避免的属灵模式 / Two Models to Avoid

Let me show you how that goes, all right?

An experience of friendship and of lordship out of an experience of our sonship and a realization of it. You see, the problem with the older religious tradition was no friendship, it's all externals. That's the reason why there's no private life, that's the reason why there's no private prayer closet, it was all externals.

But the trouble with the newer spirituality is not that there's no friendship, but there's no lordship, there's nobody to obey. I basically decide what's right and wrong for me, no friendship, no lordship, because there's no sonship. Now, first of all, I'm going to do this kind of quickly.

让我们看看它是如何进行的，好吗？这是一种出于父子关系的经历和领受主权的经历。

## 朋友式的祷告：真实的亲密关系 / Prayer as Friendship

Number one, friendship, the purpose of prayer. Look at the first part of the lord's prayer, what's that all about? This then is how you should pray.

My father in heaven, how would be your name? Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. The first half has got nothing to do with my needs.

The first half's got nothing to do with daily bread, nothing to do with my guilt, nothing to do with my anger toward people, nothing to do with the strength I need to face the challenges, nothing at all. What's going on there? Well, what am I spending the first half of the prayer doing?

I'm enjoying, I'm noticing, I'm rejoicing, I'm amazed by him. Well, before you get, now here's the point, before you ask for anything else, the primary goal of prayer, or the first thing you should ask for is him. See, when people say prayer didn't work, I always say, what do you mean prayer didn't work?

And they always tell me something they asked for that they didn't get, always. But see, the lord's prayer, basically, you know, what are you trying to do there? You're trying to make coffee in a tea maker.

Jesus says, the way prayer is supposed to be built is, before you ask for anything else first, ask for me. See, if there's anybody here who says, prayer didn't work for me, I want to ask your question to you persistently, day in and day out, time in and time out over and over and over and over again. Did you say, I want you, I want you in my life, I want your reality, I want an experience of you.

Did you do that first? Was that the primary goal? No, because I'll tell you this, if you did that, prayer would not have disappointed you.

Prayer is primarily for that. You know the place in Luke where they sermon on the, pardon me, where the lord's prayer is introduced. It's in Luke chapter 11 where Jesus tells them how to pray and use his lord's prayer.

See before Luke 11, there's a story of Martha and Mary. And Martha's running all around, that's the sister who's has Jesus at the house, and she's running all around with housework, and she's very upset and distracted and busy and so on. And Jesus, gently rebukes her, lovingly rebukes her, and says Martha, Martha, Mary has found the one thing that's necessary.

Now this is pretty interesting, here's Jesus Christ, Jesus the Christ, telling us. So we better open this up and look at it. There's only one thing you really need, everything else is negotiable, everything else is negotiable.

Nothing else do you need. If you have this, everything else is secondary. What is it?

And when he says the one thing necessary, then he says Mary is sitting at my feet and listening to my word, and commentators know. And they'll say Jesus Christ who was so completely steeped in the Psalms, so completely saturated in the Psalms, could not have not, sorry, about a double negative, he could not have not had in his mind the famous place in the Psalm, Psalm 27, verse 4, where the Psalmist David says, one thing will I seek after, one thing only do I need to gaze on the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple. And Jesus says, and David says, now David is a man who had a lot of problems, he was always running for his life, he was always in crisis, he was a king, he was a general, he was in all this stuff, and he says, there's only one thing I really need, David does not ask for safety first, he does not ask for protection first, he does not ask for success first, with all the stuff that was on him, he says, if my soul has a sense, a sense of the inner sweetness and glory, if my soul sees the beauty, if I don't just know about God but I actually taste and see his beauty, he says, well nothing else will bother me, nothing else will ever well me, nothing else will shock me, nothing else will attract me, and I'll be able to live a life at large.

And Jesus is saying that about Mary, and Jesus is saying that to you, and then comes the Lord's prayer, because that's the point of it, that's the context, friendship, let's move on, friendship is the first thing, you're not allowed because it's not built that way, you're not allowed to go asking for anything else until you've asked for his friendship, until you've sought like crazy for that, until you've asked for an experience of his holiness and love, not just knowing about it but actually a sense on your heart, that's the first point.

你发现了吗？老宗教传统的问题是没有友谊，只有外在的形式。这就是为什么没有私生活、没有个人祷告室的原因——一切都是形式上的。但新灵性运动的问题不是没有友谊，而是没有主权，没有人要顺服。

基本上我决定什么是对的和错的，没有友谊，没有主权，因为没有父子关系。首先，我会快速讲一下。

第一点是友谊，祈祷的目的。看看主祷文的第一部分，那是什么意思？

“我们在天上的父，愿人都尊你的名为圣。” 我天上的父，你的名是怎样的？你的国降临，你的旨意行在地上，如同行在天上。前半句和我的需要没有关系。

前半句和面包无关，和我的罪无关，和我对人的怒气无关，和我面对挑战所需的力量无关，完全无关。那到底发生了什么？好吧，那么，在祈祷的前半部分，我在做什么？我享受着，我注意到，我为他感到惊奇，我被他所震撼。

好吧，现在这里有个要点，在你请求其他任何事情之前，祈祷的主要目标，或者你应该首先请求的是他。你看，当人们说祈祷没有起作用时，我总是问他们，你到底是什么意思祈祷没有起作用？而他们总是告诉我他们请求却没有得到的东西。但是你看，主的祷告基本上是这样的：你知道你在那里试图做什么吗？

你试图用茶壶泡咖啡。耶稣说，祈祷应该建立的方式是，在你请求其他任何事情之前，首先请求我。你看，如果有谁在这里说祈祷没有为他起作用，我想我要持续不断地问你的问题，日复一日，时复一时，一遍又一遍地问：你是否说过，我要你，我要你在我的生命中，我要你的现实，我要体验到你。那是你的首要目标吗？

不，因为我可以告诉你，如果你做到了这一点，祈祷就不会让你失望了。祈祷主要是为了这个目的。你知道路加福音中的那个讲论主祷文的地方吗？对不起，请原谅我，就是在那里耶稣告诉他们如何祈祷和使用主的祷告。

你看，在路加福音11章之前，有一个关于玛利亚和马大的故事。马大在她家里忙来忙去，她是接待耶稣的那位姐姐，她在做家务，非常烦躁、分心且忙碌等等。耶稣温柔地责备了她，慈爱地责备了她，并说，马大，马大，玛利亚找到了那必须的一件事。现在这真是非常有趣，耶稣基督在这里告诉我们。

所以我们最好仔细看看。你真正需要的只有一样东西，其他一切都是可以商量的。你不需要别的了。如果你有这一样，其他一切就都次要了。

那是什么呢？当他说“非此不可”的时候，他提到马利亚坐在他的脚前听他的话，评论家们都知道这一点。他们会说，耶稣基督如此浸淫于诗篇之中，不可能没有在脑海中想到诗篇27章第4节中大卫所说的一句话：“我一心寻求的是耶和华。”耶稣说，大卫就是这样说的。

而大卫是一个有很多问题的人，他总是逃亡，总是处于危机之中，他是国王，是将军，经历了许多事情，但他却说：“我真正需要的只有一样东西。”大卫没有首先祈求安全，没有首先祈求保护，也没有首先祈求成功。在他所经历的一切困难中，他说：“如果我的灵魂能够感受到内在的甜美和荣耀，如果我能看到他的美丽，而不仅仅是知道他，而是实际地品尝并看见他的美丽，那么其他一切都不会困扰我，不会吸引我，不会震惊我，我会过上自由自在的生活。” 耶稣就是这样对玛丽说的，也是对你说的。

然后就是主祷文了，因为这就是它的重点和背景——友谊。让我们继续谈友谊吧，因为没有友谊是不行的。你不能在没有寻求到他的友谊之前就去祈求其他任何东西，必须疯狂地追求与他建立亲密的关系，体验他的圣洁和爱，而不仅仅是知道这些。这是第一个要点。

## 臣服与主权：改变我们的姿态 / Surrender and Lordship

Then secondly, Jesus says, no by the way, that's very different than the religious approach, but secondly, unlike the new spirituality, Jesus says the second thing you get to is his Lordship. The second purpose of prayer besides the intimacy of our Father is thy kingdom come, thy will be done.

Now here's the second thing, and this is pretty scary. Before you get to asking for the things you want, Jesus says you've got to go through this. And that is what is the real source of your problem.

So we run down to daily bread, we run down to all the other stuff, because this is what we think. We say, I'm scared, I'm worried, I'm angry, and I know how the world needs to go. And therefore there's a torrent of words that very often comes out of our hearts toward God when we pray.

Oh Lord, you just got to do this, you've got to do this. She's got to live, she's got to see, this has to happen, I've got to get in, this money has to be here, I just don't see another way, and there's a torrent of words, it's babbling by the way. That's a fair translation, we're babbling, we're just coming on.

And you know what, if we just go right to daily bread, when we're done praying, we're not going to feel less worried, we're going to feel worse. We just rehearse all the things that scare us to death. How wonderful.

And when we get down, and when we take a look at everybody who's doing bad things to us, we're done, we're going to be more bitter, we're going to be more angry, we're going to be more guilty. Oh Lord, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I don't know why I did this, torrent of words, babbling and babbling and babbling. But Jesus says, here's the first, but you've missed the, you went too fast, the more primary than asking for things, is to take yourself out of the place of God.

Until you pray, the natural stance of your heart is to walk around, if you listen carefully, you'll hear it. Your heart's always saying, my kingdom come, my will be done. My kingdom come, my will be done.

And actually, it's the source of your real trouble. It didn't come home to me till recently when I was studying Genesis 50. And in Genesis 50, Joseph, you know, remember he was betrayed by his brothers, if you know the story, he was sold into slavery.

His brothers basically tried to kill him, tried to ruin his life. At the very end they find that he's risen up to power, he has the power to pay them back. And when their father dies, they send a message and they said, please, don't hurt us.

And Joseph gets them together and what does he say? I've forgiven you. It was a lot of work, but I've forgiven you.

No, what does he say? He says, am I in the place of God? The source of all of Joseph's forgiveness, the source of his peace, the source of his lack of fear, when you're scared, you know why you're scared?

You know why you're worried? You know why you're eating up with anxiety? Some of you are right now.

You know why? Because you're sure you know how things should go. How do you know that?

How do you know how things should go? You know you're in the place of God. You assume it.

Some of you are resentful, really resentful because there are certain people who have done certain things to you and they haven't gotten their come up in and all that. You know why you're so resentful? It's not the circumstance.

It's not them. It's because you think you know what they deserve. Do you think you know?

And Joseph says, I got myself out of the place of God. That's the main reason I'm unhappy. That's the main reason I'm scared.

That's the main reason I'd be angry. I got it out. I'm out.

How do I know? You see the second part of the model is you have to experience this Lordship. You have to be willing to say, and this only happens in prayer.

It will happen through the Holy Spirit if you're willing to go after it. If you see that this is really, before you get to anything else, you've got to do this. You've got to say, Lord, buy the Holy Spirit, show me the most important thing for me to know that you're God and I'm not.

But I don't believe it. This is the reason why I can't overcome my guilt because I feel like I've got to live up. I've got to be my own savior.

This is the reason I can't overcome my anger because I know exactly what those people deserve. This is the reason I can't overcome my worry and my anxiety, because I know how the world has got to go. I know.

I know. Joseph says, get out. How awful.

Martin Luther used to say to some of you heard me say this because Martin Luther, his friend Philip Melanchthon, was horrible, he probably died of an ulcer, like some of you. His name was Philip Melanchthon. Every so often, Martin Luther would come up and he would pat him on the back and would say, let Philip cease to rule the world.

In other words, Philip's problem, Martin says, is basically theological. It's not, all psychological problems are basically theological problems. And the only way to heal your heart theologically is through prayer.

Through taking a look at his heavenliness, looking at his kingship, looking at his hallowedness, his holiness. Why is all that stuff in the beginning? Because you have to heal your heart, you have to heal your perspective and be willing to say, you're Lord, and when that happens, then you begin that life, that big life, nothing overwhelms you, nothing overcomes you, say.

Now thirdly, how can this happen? Jesus says one reason, religious people don't have friendship in their prayer life. Now what's interesting is the more non-religious people, they do have a private prayer life.

They meditate and they're seeking and so forth, but they don't have any worship. That means they say, well, everybody has to do what you have to decide what is right and wrong for you. You know what this means?

You are not after a God who can contradict you. You're not after a God who can say, I'm God and you're not. When you say, I don't believe in tradition, I don't believe in authority of any sort, I have to decide what's right and wrong for me.

What you've done is you have completely condemned yourself to being in the place of God for the rest of your life. Good luck. You're underqualified for the job.

You know what it's like to be in a job that you're underqualified for? Nothing. You might have been in a job underqualified for, but nothing like this.

And Jesus says now, friendship is the first lordship, you have to experience it, experience lordship before you ask for anything, but you say, well, how can that be? How can I know him so intimately? And how can I trust him so implicitly?

Do you hear that? So the religious person says, how can I know him that intimately? You know, he tells people to say, our father.

If you heard me say, even if you maybe you didn't know me at all, you didn't know anything about me, but if you heard me or overheard me say, my Kathy, you would immediately figure out whoever Kathy is must be wife or daughter, because you don't use words like that, unless it's very intimate. And if you overheard me, it would only be overheard me, because I would never say such a thing out loud. You don't say such a thing out loud either.

Why? You feel naked to talk like that. You don't use that kind of language in public for the people that matter to you like that.

This is a language of intimacy. And Jesus says, you start out by saying, God, you're my God, father, you're my father. Well, the religious person says, how can I know that?

How can I know that? I'm trying very hard to be good, and I'm hoping that God will favor me. How can I know that?

How can I treat him that intimately? And then on the other hand, the second person, the non-religious spiritual person says, well, you say, just trust him, just say, well, you're God and hey, I'm just like, wow, well, wait a minute here. How can you trust him like that?

The answer is the doctrine of the gospel or the doctrine of adoption. The first word is, not my king, not my lord, he's all that, my father, our father. The gospel is, the way you become a Christian is not by trying real hard through techniques, trying real hard through good works.

The doctrine of adoption is, I become a Christian when I say, father, accept me because of what Jesus has done. And at that moment, the Bible says, we get the sonship. Now, occasionally, I've had women who say, why do you keep using the term sonship as a little insensitive to the rest of us, and not actually not really?

Let me tell you why I hold on to it. Because in the New Testament, in those days, sonship was a legal status when you adopted somebody, that person not only became intimate with you, but they became your heir, like that, but only men were adopted, only men got the sonship, and yet Paul and John and all the New Testament writers have the audacity to say that when you receive Christ as your Savior, God gives you whoever you are, rich or poor, male or female, you get the sonship, you get the full rights. And when you know that, then you'll be able to pray.

Well, somebody says, I don't know, I don't know if that's enough. How is it possible? How is it possible that I could have this kind of confidence in God, this kind of intimacy with God?

Well, here's the answer. When Jesus Christ came to Simon Peter, before he was about to fall, he looked at Simon and he said, Simon, Simon, Satan wanted to have you, he wanted to sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you. So when you turn back, when you repent, when you recover, strengthen the brothers.

But Jesus said, I've prayed for you, so maybe you'll turn back, I don't know, I've prayed for you. Hebrews 7 says, Jesus Christ, when you become a Christian, Jesus Christ ever lives to intercede for us. What is the word intercede?

That means it just means prayer. Hebrews 7 says, Jesus Christ has reoriented his life, so there's one thing he lives for. He lives for.

We know what he's doing. He's always praying for us. He's standing before the Father, we're told, as it were.

And he's constantly saying, I want this in their life, and I want that in their life, I want good things in their life. And basically, when we pray, God says, I have all these incredible things I'm ready to throw into your life, not because of your merits, but because of his prayer life. Your prayer life, puny and tiniest as it is, is going to, all you got to do is just start to pray, and you're finally going to be in a position we'd be ready to receive the incredible things that are coming into your life because of his prayer life.

Just prayer life for you. If you know his prayer life for you, if you see that prayer life for you, if you know that you have that kind of assurance, then you'll be able to experience his friendship and experience his worship. Somebody says, oh yeah, how?

Can I just give you one little exercise? Fifteen minutes a day, not counting Bible study, don't you dare study the Bible and look up everything and sit down and all that, and then you pray for two minutes. That's not prayer.

After you're done studying your Bible passage, take fifteen minutes, and the first thing you need to do is listen before you speak. That's the whole point of the Lord's Prayer. Before you ask for anything, the first half is all what?

Noticing who he is, listening to who he is, hearing who he is, then you respond. That's the Lord's Prayer. The Lord's Prayer is look at this and look at this and look at this and listen to this and listen to this.

Now, here's some things I want to say to you. The whole point of the Lord's Prayer is that prayer is answering God. It's responding to God's Word.

It's not just talking. If you got an appointment with this incredibly powerful person, you wouldn't sit down and say, I have a lot of things to tell you and just talking and talking to you and I said, I hope you understood. I hope you heard that.

My hour's up. And that's how, no, no, no, here's what you do. Study your Bible passage and then the fifteen minutes begins.

First thing you do for five, six, seven minutes at the most, ask the text, two questions. What Lord are you telling me about you and what Lord are you telling me about me? Then read the text through slowly, you've already studied it, right?

Read the text through slowly, asking those two questions and listen for his voice. And then after you've written a couple of the answers down, you see, then pray those things. Adore him and thank him for what it's telling you about him.

Confess and make petition for the things that it's telling you about you. When that fifteen minutes are up, then you can go to do other things. You can do your prayer list.

You know, bless mommy and daddy and do all that. And before that fifteen minutes, you can do your Bible study. But you know what?

An awful lot of you are doing your Bible study and doing your prayer list and you're not really praying. You're not experiencing his friendship and you're not experiencing his worship out of a realization of your sonship. Make sure you open up.

For fifteen minutes, listen to his word in that text and then respond to it. Do it fifteen minutes a day. Do it thirty days in a row.

Go to Psalms or go to John, if you really say, well, where do I even turn? And then come back and tell me what happens. Prayer works if you go after his friendship and his worship first.

He has never turned down those prayers. Let's pray. Father, we ask that you would help us become people of prayer.

There are some of us here who aren't even sure what we believe. Well, the only way you're going to find you is to pray. There are many of us here who really believe we're sure, but it's all head knowledge.

There's everybody in this room needs to go back and pray. In this room needs to find that radical interiority where there's no difference between whether we're Christians or not Christians or we don't know what the heck we are. We pray, Father, for prayer.

Your son, the greatest one who ever walked the face of the earth prayed all the time. Now we know why. He was praying for us.

Knowing he was praying for us and only if we know he was praying for us will we be able to live a life of prayer ourselves. So help us to that end. We pray in Jesus' name, amen.

其次，耶稣说，这与宗教式的做法完全不同。除了与我们天父的亲密关系之外，你还可以得到他的主权。主祷文的第二个目的是“愿你的国降临，愿你的旨意行在地上如同天上”。现在说到第二点，这很可怕。

在祈求你想要的东西之前，耶稣说你需要先经历这个过程。这就是你**真正的问题所在。所以我们直接奔向每日的面包，奔向其他一切，因为我们就是**这么想的。我们说：“我害怕，我很担心，我很生气，我知道这个世界应该怎样。

”于是祈祷时从我们心中涌出了一大堆话语。主啊，请一定要这样做，一定要那样做。她必须活下去，她必须看到这一切发生，我必须进去，这笔钱必须出现，我没有其他办法了。这是一大堆话语，而且是滔滔不绝的。

没错，我们在祷告中就是这样喋喋不休地重复着我们害怕的事情。你知道吗？如果我们直接祈求每日的面包，当我们祈祷结束时，我们会更加担心，而不是感到轻松。我们只是在重述那些让我们恐惧不已的事物。

真是太好了。当我们跌倒了，当我们在审视那些对我们不好的人时，我们就会更加怨恨、愤怒和自责。哦主，我真抱歉，我真的抱歉，我不知道自己为什么会这样做，话语如洪流般倾泻而出，喋喋不休。但耶稣说，这里有一个更首要的：不是祈求，而是要将自己从神的位置上挪开。

直到你祷告时，你内心自然的姿态才会改变。如果你仔细聆听，你会听到它。你的心总是这样诉说着：“我的国降临了，愿你的旨意成就。”“我的国降临了，愿你的旨意成就。

” 实际上，这就是你真正的问题的根源。最近我在研读创世记50章时才恍然大悟。在创世记50章中，约瑟被他的兄弟出卖，被卖为奴隶，甚至他们曾试图杀死他、毁掉他的生活。但到了最后，他掌握了权力，并有权报复他们。

当他们的父亲去世后，他们请求不要伤害自己。约瑟把他们都叫到一起，他说了什么？他说：“我已经饶恕你们了。”这需要很多努力，但他已经饶恕了他们。

不，他怎么说的？他说：“我是在神的位置上吗？”约瑟的所有宽恕、他的平静和他没有恐惧的根源，正是当你害怕时，你知道为什么害怕？你为何担忧？

你为何焦虑不安？有些人现在就是如此。你知道为什么吗？因为你确信事情应该怎样进行。

你怎么知道呢？你怎么知道事情应该怎样进行？你以为自己在神的位置上。你以为。

有些人为某些人做了某些事而感到怨恨，这些人没有受到应有的惩罚。你为何如此怨恨？不是因为情况，也不是因为他们。而是因为你认为你知道他们应得什么。

你以为你知道吗？约瑟说：“我从神的位置上走了下来，这才是我不快乐的主要原因。这才是我害怕的主要原因。这也是我会生气的主要原因。

我已经出来了，我已经离开了。” 你怎么知道呢？你看这个模型的第二部分是你要经历这种主权。你必须愿意说，而这只能在祷告中发生。

如果你愿意追求它，这会通过圣灵发生。如果你看到这一点，在你做任何其他事情之前，你必须要这样做。你必须对主说：“求圣灵显明给我最重要的事，让我知道你是神而我不是。” 但我并不相信这一点。

这就是我无法克服罪疚感的原因，因为我感觉我必须活出自己的样子。我必须成为自己的救赎者。这也是我无法克服愤怒的原因，我知道那些人的确该受到惩罚。这也是我无法克服忧虑和焦虑的原因，因为我知道世界的走向。

我知道。约瑟说：“离开吧，这真可怕。” 马丁·路德曾经对你们说过这样的话，因为他有个朋友菲利普·马兰辛托恩非常糟糕，他可能是因为压力太大而去世了，就像有些人一样。他的名字是菲利普·马兰辛托恩。

偶尔，马丁·路德会过来拍拍他的背，说：“让菲利普不要统治这个世界。” 换句话说，马丁说，菲利普的问题本质上是神学问题，而不是所有的心理问题是神学问题。唯一治愈你心灵的神学方式就是祷告。通过审视他的神圣性、王权和他的圣洁。

为什么那些东西放在开头？因为你要治愈你的内心，调整你的视角，并愿意说：“你是主。”当这一切发生时，你才能开始那种大生活，没有什么能压倒你，没有什么能战胜你，你说。最后，这种转变如何实现呢？

耶稣说一个原因就是宗教人士在祷告生活中缺乏友谊。有趣的是，非宗教的人反而有私人的祷告生活。他们沉思，寻求，但没有敬拜。**这意味着他们认为每个人都必须自己决定什么是正确和错误的。**

你知道**这意味着什么吗？你不想面对一个能与你对立的神。**你不希望面对一个说“我是神，你是凡人”的神。当你声称不相信传统，不相信任何形式的权威，并且必须自己决定对错时， 你实际上把自己置于了一生中神的位置。

祝你好运吧，你根本不适合这个职位。你知道不适合某个职位是什么感觉吗？什么也不是。你可能有过一些不太合适的职位经历，但没有一个像这样。

而耶稣说：“友谊是第一位的主权。”在寻求任何东西之前，你必须体验这种主权，但是你说：这怎么可能呢？我怎么能如此亲密地认识他？我又怎么能如此信任他？

你听到了吗？宗教人士会问：我怎么能如此亲密地认识他？他告诉人们要称呼神为“我们的父亲”。如果你只听到我说“我的Kathy”，即使你完全不认识我，你也知道Kathy一定是我的妻子或女儿。

因为这种称谓只有在非常亲密的关系中才会使用，而且我绝不会当众说出这样的话。为什么呢？你觉得那样说会很尴尬，你不会在公共场合用那种语言称呼对你重要的人。这是一种亲密的语言。

耶稣说：“你开始时可以叫神为你的神、父亲。”宗教人士会问：我怎么能知道那是真的？我怎么知道呢？我在努力做好人，希望神会垂青于我。

我怎么能知道呢？如何与他亲密相待？另一方面，非宗教的灵性人士可能会说：“你说要信任他，就说他是上帝吧。我心想：哇，等等，你怎么能那样信任他呢？

” 答案在于福音中的收养之道。第一个词是：不是我的王、我的主，而是我的父、我们的父。成为基督徒的方式并不是通过努力和技巧，也不是靠做好事。收养之道是这样的：当我对神说：“父亲，请接纳我，因着耶稣所做的。

”那一刻，圣经上说我们就获得了儿子的身份。有时我会遇到女性，她们会问为什么总是用“儿子”这个词而不考虑其他人呢？其实这并非不敏感。让我告诉你我坚持使用这个词语的原因。

因为在新约时代，收养意味着被收养的人不仅与你亲密无间，还能成为你的继承人，但那时只有男性才能被收养，拥有儿子的身份。然而，保罗、约翰和其他新约作者却大胆地说：当你接受基督为救主时，无论你是富是贫、男是女，神都会赐给你儿子的身份和全部权利。当你知道这一点时，你就能与神亲密地交往。有人可能会说：“我不确定这是否足够。

”如何可能呢？我怎么可能对神有这样的信心，与他有如此的亲密关系？答案在于：当耶稣基督来到西门彼得身边，要跌倒的时候，他对西门说：“西门，西门，撒但想要得着你，如同筛麦子一样，但我为你祈求。”所以当你悔改、恢复时，你要坚固弟兄。

耶稣说：“我为你祈求了，也许你会转回。”希伯来书7章说：当你成为基督徒时，耶稣基督永远活着为我们代求。那么“代求”是什么意思呢？**这意味着只意味着祷告。**

希伯来书7章说，耶稣基督已经重新定向了他的生活，所以他只有一个追求。他只为这个而活。我们知道他在做什么。圣经告诉我们，他总是为我们祈祷。

他站在父面前，仿佛是这样。而且他不断地在说：“我希望这些事情发生在他们的生命中。”“我希望那些事情发生在他们的生命中。”“我希望他们生命中有好事发生。

”基本上，当我们祷告时，上帝会说：“我已经准备好要把许多不可思议的事情放进你的生活中，不是因为你有什么功德，而是因为他的祷告生活。你微不足道的、最渺小的祷告生活，只要你开始祈祷，你就将处于一个准备接收这些即将进入你生活的美好事物的位置上。” 只是你的祷告生活。如果你了解他的祷告生活对你意味着什么，如果你看到他对你的祷告生活，如果你知道你有这种保证，那么你就能体验到他的友谊和敬拜。

有人问：“哦，是吗？那怎么办呢？” 我可以给你一个小小的练习：每天十五分钟，不包括圣经研读，在你看完经文之后，不要去查经文、坐下来研究一切，然后祈祷两分钟。这并不是祷告。

在你完成圣经研读后，花十五分钟时间，首先你需要倾听再发言。这是主祷文的全部要点。在你向他祈求任何事情之前，前半部分都在说什么？注意他是谁，聆听他是谁，听到他是谁，然后作出回应。

这就是主祷文。主祷文是这样：“看这个、看这个、听这个、听这个。” 现在我要对你们说一些话。主祷文的整个要点在于，祷告是对神的回答，是对神话语的回应。

它不仅仅是说话。如果你有一个与这位极其强大的人物的约会，你不会坐下来只说“我有很多事情要告诉你”，然后不停地讲，希望他能理解并听到你说的话。我的时间到了。不是这样，而是你应该这样做：先研读圣经经文，然后十五分钟的祷告时间就开始了。

首先，在五到七分钟内，向这段经文提出两个问题。你告诉我在他身上看到了什么样的主？又在你身上看到了什么样的主？然后慢慢地默读这段经文，不是吗？

慢慢读这段经文，并带着这两个问题倾听他的声音。然后写下几个答案后，就为这些事祷告。赞美他并感谢他向你揭示的关于他的真理。承认并祈求那些与你有关的事。

当这十五分钟结束时，你可以去做其他事情了。你可以继续做你的祈祷清单。你知道，祝福妈妈和爸爸，做好这一切。但在那十五分钟内，你可以进行圣经研读。

但是你知道吗？你们当中很多人在做圣经研读和祈祷清单时，并没有真正地祷告。你们并没有体验到他的友谊，也没有从认识到自己的儿子身份中体验到敬拜。确保你敞开心扉。

每天花十五分钟倾听这段文字中的他的话语，然后回应它。坚持每天十五分钟，连续三十天。你可以选择诗篇或约翰福音，如果你真的不知道该去哪里开始，就来告诉我发生了什么。祷告是有效的，只要你首先寻求他的友谊和敬拜。

他从不拒绝这些祈祷。让我们祷告。父亲，求你帮助我们成为祷告的人。在场有些人甚至不确定自己相信什么。

唯一的方法就是通过祷告找到答案。在场很多人确信自己有所信仰，但都是理论上的知识。每个人都需要回去祷告，在这里需要找到那种根本性的内在体验，无论我们是基督徒还是非基督徒或不知道自己是什么身份。父亲，请为我们祷告。

你的儿子，有史以来最伟大的人，总是不断地祷告。现在我们知道原因了。他为你们而祷告。了解他为我们代祷，并且只有当我们知道他为我们代祷时，我们才能过上一种祈祷的生活。

所以求你帮助我们达到这个目标。我们在耶稣的名里祷告，阿们。感谢您收听蒂姆·凯勒在《福音与生活播客》上的讲道。如果您希望看到更多人通过福音中心的信息和资源得到鼓励，请考虑成为《福音与生活》的月度合作伙伴。
