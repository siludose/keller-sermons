# Jesus’ Model of Spirituality / Jesus’ Model of Spirituality

## Chinese Translation / 中文翻译 / English Transcript

Welcome to Gospel in Life. What does it really mean to live in a way that reflects God's kingdom? For many of us, the kingdom can feel like an abstract idea.

But in today's teaching from the sermon on the Mount, Tim Keller shows how Christ offers us practical guidance for living out a compelling vision of a new kind of community shaped by grace. In your bulletin, we come to the part of the sermon on the Mount, very famous part, part that you come to Redeemer, you actually recite part of this every week. Matthew chapter 5, pardon me, Matthew chapter 6, verses 5 through 13.

And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, or they love to pray. Standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men, I tell you the truth they have received their reward in full. But when you go, when you pray, go into your room, close the door, and pray to your father who was unseen, then your father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.

And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like the pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your father knows what you need before you ask him. This then is how you should pray.

Our father in heaven, how would be your name? Your kingdom come, you will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread, forgive us our debts as we have also, as we have forgiven our debtors, and lead us not in temptation, but deliver us from evil.

This is God's Word. Now we are going through the sermon on the Mount, and we come to the subject of prayer, and this actually, believe it or not, is a very hot topic in our society today. In the culture in general, the last few years there has been an explosion of interest in prayer and spirituality, in meditation, and spiritual experience.

This year, on the first Monday of the month, we get our small group leaders together, our ministry leadership together, and I went through and talked about meditation and prayer, and one thing that was very striking to me is just how much hunger there was there, and amongst our own leaders for this. But the importance, actually, for Jesus of prayer, is to some degree revealed in this little unobtrusive word that you'd probably miss at the very, very top of the page, the very beginning of the passage in verse 5, little word, and, and. This prayer is an standalone for Jesus.

It's connected. See, there are places where we've already seen in the sermon on the Mount, where Jesus almost seems to talk like a sort of social justice radical activist, you know, there's a place in the luke in version of the sermon on the Mount, where Jesus says, and I quote, sell your possessions and give them to the poor, unquote. And right before this passage, in chapter 6, Matthew 6, one to four, Jesus is talking about our engagement with the poor and our giving of the poor and our, our intense engagement with the worlds and the needs of the world, and then he gets to verse 5, and he says, and when you pray, and when you pray, now look, when you're talking and you're talking about something is, and that means it's connected.

He doesn't say, well, let's change the subject. Let's get on to prayer, I don't know. In Jesus' mind, in Jesus' understanding, it is the people, I'll say it's slowly, it is the people who are characterized by the most radical interiority that have the most courageous, visionary engagement with the world.

It is the people who are most characterized by radical interiority, an incredible inner life of prayer that are, their life is characterized by buoyant, promiscuous generosity and engagement with the needs of the world. Jesus does not put these things against each other, as a matter of fact, he says, they really can't happen without each other. If you're really praying, it drives you out.

And if you're really effective out there, it's coming from within. Real interiority, now I'm using that term because there's a book, and by the way, if you're starting to read on prayer, this should not be one of your first fifteen books. It's a little hard to read, in many ways, don't make it your sixteenth, all right?

But there's a very famous book by St. Teresa of Avila called the Interior Castle. And it's a beautiful image, it's a fascinating image.

She says, when you, in your soul, actually find the king. When you actually get into the, into ultimate spiritual reality, when you actually get in connection with the cosmic throne room, your soul, your insides become a castle of light and of love and of radiance. There's a radical radiance, an interior radiance that happens, and that Jesus says is the thing you've got to have, if you're going to have this incredible life in the world.

You see, Jesus sees the importance of prayer, and however, Jesus gives us a model of prayer and spirituality, and before he gives us the model, which is in versus, you know, the famous Lord's Prayer in verse 9 and following, he tells us two other models that we should avoid. This is very important, very important to see, you know, Jesus is very, he's willing to be negative in order to be positive. He says, I'm going to give you a model of spirituality, and if you understand it, and if you receive it, and if you use it, then it's going to have this tremendous effect on your life.

You know, I've just heard tons of people say to me over the years, I've tried prayer, but it didn't work. Now, by the way, I have something at home that looks like a coffee maker, but it's a tea maker, and I like it very much. But if you ever stay in my house and you try to make coffee in it, you're going to say this coffee maker doesn't work.

No, it won't, because it's not built to brew coffee, it's built to brew tea. And when people say, I've tried prayer, it didn't work. What Jesus is saying is, well, you used prayer, not the way I designed it, but you used a false model of spirituality.

And what he does here in this paragraph in verses 5-8, he gives us two false models of spirituality. And then he turns around verses 9 to the end, and he gives his own model. Now, let's take a look at the false models and then his own models, and we'll conclude with some practical stuff, because people have been pressing me.

So when you get to the sermon on the mount, the whole idea on the sermon on the mount is practical. Tell me how to do this. Don't just make me say, don't just let me walk away feeling like I ought to pray more.

How? So let's look at the false models, the true model, and a couple of practical ideas here on how to go about it. The two models, and now look, if you look carefully, you'll see that Jesus says in verse 5, when you pray, do not be like, and on verse 7, he says, and when you pray, do not be like.

He has two groups of people, and he says, when you pray, don't use these models, or you'll be brewing coffee in a tea maker, and it won't work. First model is religious prayer. When you pray, don't be like the hypocrites for they love to pray, standing in the synagogue and on the street corners to be seen by men.

Now, when you first read this, the first impression is, these are, these are fanatic texts. They like to pray in the synagogue, while people did stand and pray in the synagogue. This is formal worship, but it also says, on the street corners, and right away that evokes a picture of some guy walking along, and not here, 69th, and Park, and suddenly praying out loud and everybody saying, well, I mean, this is New York and so.

That's not what it's trying to evoke. The street corners meant a town square, a place where the streets came together. And the connotation is this, these are people who not only go to formal worship services, but they lead in prayer in community, civil, religious events.

And this is what Jesus is getting at with this kind of prayer. Is there anything wrong with that? Is there anything wrong with coming and praying in church or synagogue?

Is there anything wrong with leading in prayer at large public events? And the answer is no, but he says, this kind of person has no interior personal prayer life. You see, he contrasts it with the people he says, but when you pray, go in your room.

These are people who have a public prayer life, but not a private prayer life. And the reason is, the reason they see for prayer is it makes them fit in with a social order to be seen by men. This is like, religious prayer is where prayer and worship functions as helping you fit into your family, fit into your town, fit into your social order, fit into your people, fit into your culture, and it puts you in the right place.

It's like when the politician ends his speech by saying, and may God bless us all, he has no prayer life, and all the people love it. And they tell the focus group people, oh, I don't really like that, but they don't have a prayer life either. But everybody feels better.

Everyone feels better because in a sense, it baptizes the social order, or it's like this. The average person in the world, if you say, why are you Muslim? Why are you Catholic?

Why are you Presbyterian? Why are you Baptist? And the average person says, if they're honest, because that's where I'm from.

You know, I'm Italian, so I'm Catholic. I'm Arabic, so I'm Muslim. I'm from Tennessee, so I'm Baptist.

I'm... Well, yeah. In other words, well, this is my people, this is who I am, and what this means is not look at.

We're not talking about people who come and they're all dead inside. When people who's basically prayer and worship is religious, it's cultural. If you were raised in a kind of church, you're raised in a kind of service, and this is who your people are, see?

And this is who your town is, and this is who your tribe is, and this is your family is. You're used to it. You had a kind of an inner peace when you go, and you do feel what?

You feel good, or there's certainly some sense of stability, and there's some sense of inner peace when it... But here's what Jesus is saying. You are not relating to God, you're relating to an environment, a social environment.

You feel... You're connected to your roots, that's why you feel good, or you feel maybe even some nostalgia or familiarity, or just a sense of being part of my tradition, but it's a connection to the tradition, or to your family, or to your roots, or to your social order, but it's not a connection to God. And he says the sign of that is that when you go into your private closet to pray, you've got nothing to say.

There's no passion to know him. There's no passion to meet with him. There's no passion to want to be with him.

You don't sense that at all. You pray maybe when there's trouble, but when there's no trouble, when there's nothing forcing you, when there's no social reason, when there's no family reason, when there's no circumstantial reason. You don't have any internal pressure to actually know him, or meet him, or see him.

And Jesus says, this is the sign that you're basically... This is just religious prayer, you're not really connected to him, you're connected to an environment. The environment makes you feel kind of good, but you're not actually connected to him at all.

The sign is, you don't have a continual, growing, personal, secret, private prayer life. You don't know what to say. You're bored when you get to it, just by yourself.

Now, let me take the gloves off for a second before we move on here. This is Jesus' words. How do you know if you're a hypocrite?

How do you know if you're a hypocrite? Now, do you know what a hypocrite is? A hypocrite is something that somebody who's one thing on the outside and another thing on the inside.

How do you know you're a hypocrite? Well, we don't go to the place he goes. We go to sex.

We say, he says he's so moral, but he's having an affair on the side. But Jesus doesn't use sex as your test for hypocrisy. I'm not saying that's right, but that's not the test.

That's not the most telling test. Well someone says, let's take a look at money. He says, she says they're very devoted to God, but you know, they're selfishly spending money on themselves.

They don't give it to the poor. They don't give it to the church. Of course, that's bad, too.

However, Jesus says, that's not the acid test. That's the acid test that you're a hypocrite. You don't have a prayer life.

There's a sermon I read years ago when I was in seminary by Jonathan Edwards. Jonathan Edwards wrote this sermon years ago, and the name of it was hypocrite's deficient in the duty of prayer. And I had nightmares for about a month after I read that sermon because this is simply what he says.

He says there's only one thing that you don't do for show in the Christian life. There's only one thing. It's secret prayer because everything else is for show.

Everything else somebody sees. Secret prayer is the only thing you do just for God, just for Him, not for anybody else, not even for yourself, just for Him. It's the only thing in your life you don't do, you Christian life you don't do for show.

And therefore, if you do everything else but secret prayer, all of your Christian life is just for show. Admit it. You don't have a secret prayer life.

He says that's a sign of hypocrisy. That's a sign that the reason you pray is because of your environment, not because of God. You're trying to...

Okay, you got that enough, that's enough. You feel bad enough. Let's move on.

Jesus actually, though, very interestingly, and it's a little weird, except it's actually easier to see today. He turns to another group. And down to verse 70 says, and when you pray, don't keep on babbling like the pagans.

Now, this is a little hard to translate. First of all, the word babble is a hotbox Lagomana in all of Greek literature. This word is used not only only here in the whole Bible, but it's only used here in all Greek literature we know, it's no other place.

And it kind of means a torrent of words, sort of a intense torrent of words, not just many words, but kind of frantic words. And the word pagans is Jesus' word, ethne, which is often also translated nations, but in the New Testament, it usually means the unreligious. It means the licentious.

It means the immoral. It means the non-religious. Now, why is Jesus talking about non-religious prayer?

Well, to one thing that would be interesting to go to in a tangent, but I won't. One thing Jesus is saying here is there really isn't such a thing as a prayerless heart. What he's really saying is something now, you know, snotty Christians over the years have put it this way.

There are no atheists and foxholes. That's a pretty snotty way to put it. But what he's really, what Jesus is saying is that prayer is the involuntary reflex of the heart.

No matter what you say you believe, no matter what you think about the universe, the fact is when you feel your humanity, when you feel your vulnerability, you can't stop yourself from praying. No matter what you say you believe, there are times in which you can't not pray, which means that your heart knows, in spite of what you're going to like telling you, there's a God and you need him. The torrent comes out, no matter who you are, but that's not all.

Jesus says, they think they will be here, heard, for their torrent. Robert Wuth now, I quoted him in the fall, it's a really worthwhile book to read. Where Robert Wuth now wrote a book recently called After Heaven, he's probably the leading sociologist of religion, he teaches at Princeton University, a very prominent man, and he's the book After Heaven was a very, very thoroughgoing sociological reflection and study of spirituality today.

He says, and this is fascinating in light of this passage, he says that the older approach to spirituality in this country was what he called, he called it an inhabiting, an inhabiting model, an inhabitation. He says, the inhabiting model was, you went to sacred places out of family tradition, sounds like what we've just talked about, the religious approach. He says, in the past, people went to sacred places, churches, synagogues, cathedrals, out of the tradition of your people and of your family, but he says, the newer version is sprung up in the last two years, are by people who say, I hate religious institutions.

I'm spiritual, I'm not religious, everybody has to decide what is true or right for him or herself, everyone has to decide who God is for him or herself, everybody has to decide that for yourself. I'm putting my own religion together, but basically they say, I'm not religious, I'm spiritual and they're really into prayer, they don't go to church, they don't want to be part of something like that, but they're into meditation, they're into all sorts of spiritual exercises, they're into all sorts of spiritual emphasis on touching the spiritual, but Robert Wuth now rightly so and it's very fair of him and he's very careful man, he's a leading scholar. He says, in the end, it's not much different than religious prayer, the older version.

He calls this the seeking model of spirituality and the older one, the inhabiting model. One says, I'm here, this is my place, these are my people, that's why I pray the way I do. And the seeking model is a kind of journey who says, well, we never really arrive, we never really have any answers, we're just always seeking.

He says, one of the big problems is, whereas the former was culture driven, this one is technique driven, new spirituality is very technique driven, you have visualization techniques, you have relaxation techniques, extremely technique driven, but in the end, it's not really trying to reach God either, it's trying to use this divine to get the kind of inner peace and spirituality you feel like you need to get to your goals. You see, the old religious approach basically baptizes the social order, that's the reason why the older religious traditions to some degree have been rejected because very often the oppression and the injustice and the bigotry of the old social orders were baptized by the religious tradition. But you know what's interesting is the newer spirituality in many ways also is essentially just a way of sort of spiritually baptizing my goals in life.

For example, if you use the more modern spiritual technique, let's say you're a baseball player and you're trying to kind of use spiritual techniques to be a better baseball, but you just visualize yourself hitting at home run over and over and over again. You know what you're saying is, this is the world I want, and I'm going to use the divine to get there. And Robert Wuth now is smart enough to say, that's just as superficial as the old approach, because instead of submitting to something, instead of really being changed, you're basically using the divine to get what you want.

And Jesus says, they think they'll be heard because of their parent. They think because I've got, I can do something, I can change things, I can create the world the way I want it, I can visualize the world the way I want it, I can put myself in a position where I'm reaching my goals, Jesus says, no, no, no, no. No, he says, both of these are wrong and they're bad models.

My model is this. And in the Lord's Prayer, and by the way, this summer, our preaching team is going to go through the Lord's Prayer because spirituality is so hot, and we're going to have a number of pastors go through it. But here's what I would say is a kind of summary, which by no means a hopeful steal the thunder either from my own serpents on the Lord's Prayer this summer or anybody else's.

But he basically says this, my model of spirituality is this, the purpose of prayer, what is prayer really about? Is it to get things, is to get inner peace, is it to, what is prayer about? He says it's to experience the friendship of God and experience the Lordship of God out of a realization of our sonship with God.

It's an experience of friendship and an experience of Lordship out of a realization of our sonship. Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer? Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith?

For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding of what it means to follow Christ. A great resource to start using this summer is the new city catechism devotional, God's truth for our hearts and minds. This devotional brings the historic catechisms of the Christian Church to life, offering a question to consider for each week of the year.

In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catechesis, the rich and communal practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers that frame the foundational beliefs of the Christian faith. Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer, and a brief meditation that will challenge and inspire you. The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller, and Kevin D.

Young, as well as historical figures such as Augustine, John Calvin, and Martin Luther. This month, in addition to the new city catechism devotional, we are including a great companion resource, the new city catechism for kids, as our thank you for your gift, to help gospel and life share the hope of Christ's love with people all over the world. So request your copies today at gospelonlife.com slash give.

That's gospelonlife.com slash give. Now here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. Let me show you how that goes, all right?

An experience of friendship and of lordship out of an experience of our sonship and a realization of it. You see, the problem with the older religious tradition was no friendship, it's all externals. That's the reason why there's no private life, that's the reason why there's no private prayer closet, it was all externals.

But the trouble with the newer spirituality is not that there's no friendship, but there's no lordship, there's nobody to obey. I basically decide what's right and wrong for me, no friendship, no lordship, because there's no sonship. Now, first of all, I'm going to do this kind of quickly.

Number one, friendship, the purpose of prayer. Look at the first part of the lord's prayer, what's that all about? This then is how you should pray.

My father in heaven, how would be your name? Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. The first half has got nothing to do with my needs.

The first half's got nothing to do with daily bread, nothing to do with my guilt, nothing to do with my anger toward people, nothing to do with the strength I need to face the challenges, nothing at all. What's going on there? Well, what am I spending the first half of the prayer doing?

I'm enjoying, I'm noticing, I'm rejoicing, I'm amazed by him. Well, before you get, now here's the point, before you ask for anything else, the primary goal of prayer, or the first thing you should ask for is him. See, when people say prayer didn't work, I always say, what do you mean prayer didn't work?

And they always tell me something they asked for that they didn't get, always. But see, the lord's prayer, basically, you know, what are you trying to do there? You're trying to make coffee in a tea maker.

Jesus says, the way prayer is supposed to be built is, before you ask for anything else first, ask for me. See, if there's anybody here who says, prayer didn't work for me, I want to ask your question to you persistently, day in and day out, time in and time out over and over and over and over again. Did you say, I want you, I want you in my life, I want your reality, I want an experience of you.

Did you do that first? Was that the primary goal? No, because I'll tell you this, if you did that, prayer would not have disappointed you.

Prayer is primarily for that. You know the place in Luke where they sermon on the, pardon me, where the lord's prayer is introduced. It's in Luke chapter 11 where Jesus tells them how to pray and use his lord's prayer.

See before Luke 11, there's a story of Martha and Mary. And Martha's running all around, that's the sister who's has Jesus at the house, and she's running all around with housework, and she's very upset and distracted and busy and so on. And Jesus, gently rebukes her, lovingly rebukes her, and says Martha, Martha, Mary has found the one thing that's necessary.

Now this is pretty interesting, here's Jesus Christ, Jesus the Christ, telling us. So we better open this up and look at it. There's only one thing you really need, everything else is negotiable, everything else is negotiable.

Nothing else do you need. If you have this, everything else is secondary. What is it?

And when he says the one thing necessary, then he says Mary is sitting at my feet and listening to my word, and commentators know. And they'll say Jesus Christ who was so completely steeped in the Psalms, so completely saturated in the Psalms, could not have not, sorry, about a double negative, he could not have not had in his mind the famous place in the Psalm, Psalm 27, verse 4, where the Psalmist David says, one thing will I seek after, one thing only do I need to gaze on the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple. And Jesus says, and David says, now David is a man who had a lot of problems, he was always running for his life, he was always in crisis, he was a king, he was a general, he was in all this stuff, and he says, there's only one thing I really need, David does not ask for safety first, he does not ask for protection first, he does not ask for success first, with all the stuff that was on him, he says, if my soul has a sense, a sense of the inner sweetness and glory, if my soul sees the beauty, if I don't just know about God but I actually taste and see his beauty, he says, well nothing else will bother me, nothing else will ever well me, nothing else will shock me, nothing else will attract me, and I'll be able to live a life at large.

And Jesus is saying that about Mary, and Jesus is saying that to you, and then comes the Lord's prayer, because that's the point of it, that's the context, friendship, let's move on, friendship is the first thing, you're not allowed because it's not built that way, you're not allowed to go asking for anything else until you've asked for his friendship, until you've sought like crazy for that, until you've asked for an experience of his holiness and love, not just knowing about it but actually a sense on your heart, that's the first point. Then secondly, Jesus says, no by the way, that's very different than the religious approach, but secondly, unlike the new spirituality, Jesus says the second thing you get to is his Lordship. The second purpose of prayer besides the intimacy of our Father is thy kingdom come, thy will be done.

Now here's the second thing, and this is pretty scary. Before you get to asking for the things you want, Jesus says you've got to go through this. And that is what is the real source of your problem.

So we run down to daily bread, we run down to all the other stuff, because this is what we think. We say, I'm scared, I'm worried, I'm angry, and I know how the world needs to go. And therefore there's a torrent of words that very often comes out of our hearts toward God when we pray.

Oh Lord, you just got to do this, you've got to do this. She's got to live, she's got to see, this has to happen, I've got to get in, this money has to be here, I just don't see another way, and there's a torrent of words, it's babbling by the way. That's a fair translation, we're babbling, we're just coming on.

And you know what, if we just go right to daily bread, when we're done praying, we're not going to feel less worried, we're going to feel worse. We just rehearse all the things that scare us to death. How wonderful.

And when we get down, and when we take a look at everybody who's doing bad things to us, we're done, we're going to be more bitter, we're going to be more angry, we're going to be more guilty. Oh Lord, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I don't know why I did this, torrent of words, babbling and babbling and babbling. But Jesus says, here's the first, but you've missed the, you went too fast, the more primary than asking for things, is to take yourself out of the place of God.

Until you pray, the natural stance of your heart is to walk around, if you listen carefully, you'll hear it. Your heart's always saying, my kingdom come, my will be done. My kingdom come, my will be done.

And actually, it's the source of your real trouble. It didn't come home to me till recently when I was studying Genesis 50. And in Genesis 50, Joseph, you know, remember he was betrayed by his brothers, if you know the story, he was sold into slavery.

His brothers basically tried to kill him, tried to ruin his life. At the very end they find that he's risen up to power, he has the power to pay them back. And when their father dies, they send a message and they said, please, don't hurt us.

And Joseph gets them together and what does he say? I've forgiven you. It was a lot of work, but I've forgiven you.

No, what does he say? He says, am I in the place of God? The source of all of Joseph's forgiveness, the source of his peace, the source of his lack of fear, when you're scared, you know why you're scared?

You know why you're worried? You know why you're eating up with anxiety? Some of you are right now.

You know why? Because you're sure you know how things should go. How do you know that?

How do you know how things should go? You know you're in the place of God. You assume it.

Some of you are resentful, really resentful because there are certain people who have done certain things to you and they haven't gotten their come up in and all that. You know why you're so resentful? It's not the circumstance.

It's not them. It's because you think you know what they deserve. Do you think you know?

And Joseph says, I got myself out of the place of God. That's the main reason I'm unhappy. That's the main reason I'm scared.

That's the main reason I'd be angry. I got it out. I'm out.

How do I know? You see the second part of the model is you have to experience this Lordship. You have to be willing to say, and this only happens in prayer.

It will happen through the Holy Spirit if you're willing to go after it. If you see that this is really, before you get to anything else, you've got to do this. You've got to say, Lord, buy the Holy Spirit, show me the most important thing for me to know that you're God and I'm not.

But I don't believe it. This is the reason why I can't overcome my guilt because I feel like I've got to live up. I've got to be my own savior.

This is the reason I can't overcome my anger because I know exactly what those people deserve. This is the reason I can't overcome my worry and my anxiety, because I know how the world has got to go. I know.

I know. Joseph says, get out. How awful.

Martin Luther used to say to some of you heard me say this because Martin Luther, his friend Philip Melanchthon, was horrible, he probably died of an ulcer, like some of you. His name was Philip Melanchthon. Every so often, Martin Luther would come up and he would pat him on the back and would say, let Philip cease to rule the world.

In other words, Philip's problem, Martin says, is basically theological. It's not, all psychological problems are basically theological problems. And the only way to heal your heart theologically is through prayer.

Through taking a look at his heavenliness, looking at his kingship, looking at his hallowedness, his holiness. Why is all that stuff in the beginning? Because you have to heal your heart, you have to heal your perspective and be willing to say, you're Lord, and when that happens, then you begin that life, that big life, nothing overwhelms you, nothing overcomes you, say.

Now thirdly, how can this happen? Jesus says one reason, religious people don't have friendship in their prayer life. Now what's interesting is the more non-religious people, they do have a private prayer life.

They meditate and they're seeking and so forth, but they don't have any worship. That means they say, well, everybody has to do what you have to decide what is right and wrong for you. You know what this means?

You are not after a God who can contradict you. You're not after a God who can say, I'm God and you're not. When you say, I don't believe in tradition, I don't believe in authority of any sort, I have to decide what's right and wrong for me.

What you've done is you have completely condemned yourself to being in the place of God for the rest of your life. Good luck. You're underqualified for the job.

You know what it's like to be in a job that you're underqualified for? Nothing. You might have been in a job underqualified for, but nothing like this.

And Jesus says now, friendship is the first lordship, you have to experience it, experience lordship before you ask for anything, but you say, well, how can that be? How can I know him so intimately? And how can I trust him so implicitly?

Do you hear that? So the religious person says, how can I know him that intimately? You know, he tells people to say, our father.

If you heard me say, even if you maybe you didn't know me at all, you didn't know anything about me, but if you heard me or overheard me say, my Kathy, you would immediately figure out whoever Kathy is must be wife or daughter, because you don't use words like that, unless it's very intimate. And if you overheard me, it would only be overheard me, because I would never say such a thing out loud. You don't say such a thing out loud either.

Why? You feel naked to talk like that. You don't use that kind of language in public for the people that matter to you like that.

This is a language of intimacy. And Jesus says, you start out by saying, God, you're my God, father, you're my father. Well, the religious person says, how can I know that?

How can I know that? I'm trying very hard to be good, and I'm hoping that God will favor me. How can I know that?

How can I treat him that intimately? And then on the other hand, the second person, the non-religious spiritual person says, well, you say, just trust him, just say, well, you're God and hey, I'm just like, wow, well, wait a minute here. How can you trust him like that?

The answer is the doctrine of the gospel or the doctrine of adoption. The first word is, not my king, not my lord, he's all that, my father, our father. The gospel is, the way you become a Christian is not by trying real hard through techniques, trying real hard through good works.

The doctrine of adoption is, I become a Christian when I say, father, accept me because of what Jesus has done. And at that moment, the Bible says, we get the sonship. Now, occasionally, I've had women who say, why do you keep using the term sonship as a little insensitive to the rest of us, and not actually not really?

Let me tell you why I hold on to it. Because in the New Testament, in those days, sonship was a legal status when you adopted somebody, that person not only became intimate with you, but they became your heir, like that, but only men were adopted, only men got the sonship, and yet Paul and John and all the New Testament writers have the audacity to say that when you receive Christ as your Savior, God gives you whoever you are, rich or poor, male or female, you get the sonship, you get the full rights. And when you know that, then you'll be able to pray.

Well, somebody says, I don't know, I don't know if that's enough. How is it possible? How is it possible that I could have this kind of confidence in God, this kind of intimacy with God?

Well, here's the answer. When Jesus Christ came to Simon Peter, before he was about to fall, he looked at Simon and he said, Simon, Simon, Satan wanted to have you, he wanted to sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you. So when you turn back, when you repent, when you recover, strengthen the brothers.

But Jesus said, I've prayed for you, so maybe you'll turn back, I don't know, I've prayed for you. Hebrews 7 says, Jesus Christ, when you become a Christian, Jesus Christ ever lives to intercede for us. What is the word intercede?

That means it just means prayer. Hebrews 7 says, Jesus Christ has reoriented his life, so there's one thing he lives for. He lives for.

We know what he's doing. He's always praying for us. He's standing before the Father, we're told, as it were.

And he's constantly saying, I want this in their life, and I want that in their life, I want good things in their life. And basically, when we pray, God says, I have all these incredible things I'm ready to throw into your life, not because of your merits, but because of his prayer life. Your prayer life, puny and tiniest as it is, is going to, all you got to do is just start to pray, and you're finally going to be in a position we'd be ready to receive the incredible things that are coming into your life because of his prayer life.

Just prayer life for you. If you know his prayer life for you, if you see that prayer life for you, if you know that you have that kind of assurance, then you'll be able to experience his friendship and experience his worship. Somebody says, oh yeah, how?

Can I just give you one little exercise? Fifteen minutes a day, not counting Bible study, don't you dare study the Bible and look up everything and sit down and all that, and then you pray for two minutes. That's not prayer.

After you're done studying your Bible passage, take fifteen minutes, and the first thing you need to do is listen before you speak. That's the whole point of the Lord's Prayer. Before you ask for anything, the first half is all what?

Noticing who he is, listening to who he is, hearing who he is, then you respond. That's the Lord's Prayer. The Lord's Prayer is look at this and look at this and look at this and listen to this and listen to this.

Now, here's some things I want to say to you. The whole point of the Lord's Prayer is that prayer is answering God. It's responding to God's Word.

It's not just talking. If you got an appointment with this incredibly powerful person, you wouldn't sit down and say, I have a lot of things to tell you and just talking and talking to you and I said, I hope you understood. I hope you heard that.

My hour's up. And that's how, no, no, no, here's what you do. Study your Bible passage and then the fifteen minutes begins.

First thing you do for five, six, seven minutes at the most, ask the text, two questions. What Lord are you telling me about you and what Lord are you telling me about me? Then read the text through slowly, you've already studied it, right?

Read the text through slowly, asking those two questions and listen for his voice. And then after you've written a couple of the answers down, you see, then pray those things. Adore him and thank him for what it's telling you about him.

Confess and make petition for the things that it's telling you about you. When that fifteen minutes are up, then you can go to do other things. You can do your prayer list.

You know, bless mommy and daddy and do all that. And before that fifteen minutes, you can do your Bible study. But you know what?

An awful lot of you are doing your Bible study and doing your prayer list and you're not really praying. You're not experiencing his friendship and you're not experiencing his worship out of a realization of your sonship. Make sure you open up.

For fifteen minutes, listen to his word in that text and then respond to it. Do it fifteen minutes a day. Do it thirty days in a row.

Go to Psalms or go to John, if you really say, well, where do I even turn? And then come back and tell me what happens. Prayer works if you go after his friendship and his worship first.

He has never turned down those prayers. Let's pray. Father, we ask that you would help us become people of prayer.

There are some of us here who aren't even sure what we believe. Well, the only way you're going to find you is to pray. There are many of us here who really believe we're sure, but it's all head knowledge.

There's everybody in this room needs to go back and pray. In this room needs to find that radical interiority where there's no difference between whether we're Christians or not Christians or we don't know what the heck we are. We pray, Father, for prayer.

Your son, the greatest one who ever walked the face of the earth prayed all the time. Now we know why. He was praying for us.

Knowing he was praying for us and only if we know he was praying for us will we be able to live a life of prayer ourselves. So help us to that end. We pray in Jesus' name, amen.

欢迎来到《生命中的福音》。什么是真正地以反映神国的方式生活？对于很多人来说，神国可能只是一个抽象的概念。但在今天从山上宝训中，提摩太·基勒（Tim Keller）向我们展示了基督如何为我们提供了实践性的指导，让我们活出一种新的社区愿景，这种社区由恩典塑造。

在你们的圣餐手册上，有一部分是山上宝训中最著名的部分，在你们来红门教会的时候，每周都会诵读这部分内容。请原谅我，这是马太福音第6章5至13节。当你祷告时，不要像假冒为善的人一样，他们喜欢祷告。站在会堂里或街角，为了让人看见。

我告诉你们实话，他们已经得到了他们的赏赐。但当你去的时候，当你祷告时，到你的房间里去，关上门，向那看不见的父祷告；你的父既然看见你暗中的善行，必然报答你。当你祷告时，不要像外邦人一样喋喋不休，因为他们以为自己会被听见是因为他们说得多。你们不要像他们那样，因为你们的父亲是知道你们一切需要的，直到你们求他之前就已经知道了。

所以，这就是你们应该怎样祷告： 我们的天父，愿你的名被尊为圣，愿你的国降临，愿你的旨意行在地上如同行在天上。我们日用的饮食，今日赐给我们。赦免我们的罪孽，像我们赦免那些得罪我们的人。不要让我们陷入试探，救我们脱离恶者。

这是神的话语。现在我们正在研读山上宝训，并且来到了祷告的主题上，这实际上是一个非常热门的话题，在当今的文化中，过去几年里对祈祷和灵性、冥想和精神体验的兴趣激增。今年一月的第一个星期一，我们把小组领队和教会领导聚集起来，我向他们讲解了冥想与祷告。让我印象深刻的是，大家对祷告的热情和渴望。

耶稣对于祷告的重要性，在这段经文的开头，第5节的一个小而不起眼的词中隐约透露出来——“和”。这句祷告是耶稣自己独立的祷告。它是有联系的。你看，在登山宝训中，我们已经看到过耶稣仿佛像是一个社会正义激进分子在说话，比如他在路加福音中的版本里说：“你们要变卖所有的赒济穷人。

”而在这一段落之前，马太福音6章1到4节中，耶稣正在谈论我们对穷人的关怀和施舍，以及我们与世界的需求紧密相连。然后到了第5节，他说：“当你们祷告的时候……”这表明，当你在说话时，你是在讨论某件事，**这意味着它是有联系的。**耶稣并没有说让我们换个话题，开始祈祷吧。相反，在耶稣的思想中，那些最具有深刻内心生活的人，也是最有勇气、有远见地与世界互动的人。

那些最具有深刻内心生活的人，他们的生命充满了慷慨和对世界需求的积极回应。耶稣没有将这些事情对立起来，事实上，他说它们是相互依存的。如果你真的在祷告，它会驱使你这样做。如果你真的在外头有效果，那是因为内在。

**真正的内心生活，我用这个词是**因为有一本书，顺便说一句，如果你开始读祈祷相关的书，这本书绝对不是你最先读的十五本之一。它的阅读难度有点大，所以不要把它排在第十六位。但是圣多玛斯·阿奎纳写过一本非常著名的书《城堡内院》。这是一幅美丽的图景，也是一幅引人入胜的图景。

她写道：当你真正地在灵魂中找到国王时，在终极灵性现实中找到了连接，与宇宙王座室建立了联系，你的灵魂、内心会变成一座行云流水般充满光和爱的城堡。有一种根本性的光辉，一种内在的光辉会发生，而耶稣说这就是你必须拥有的，如果你想要在这个世界上拥有这种非凡的生活。你看，耶稣看到了祈祷的重要性，然而，在给出我们一个祈祷和灵性生活的模型之前，他先告诉我们两种应该避免的模式。这一点非常重要，非常重要要看到，你知道，耶稣愿意用否定的方式来说出肯定的内容。

他说：“我将给你们一个灵性的模型，如果你理解它，并接受并使用它，那么它会对你的生活产生巨大的影响。” 你知道，这些年里，我听很多人对我说过这样的话：我已经试过了祈祷，但它没有效果。顺便说一句，我家有个看起来像咖啡机的东西，但实际上是个茶壶，我很喜欢它。但如果你在我家尝试用它来煮咖啡，你会觉得这台咖啡机不起作用。

不，它不会起作用，因为它不是用来煮咖啡的，而是用来煮茶的。当人们说：“我已经试过了祈祷，但它没有效果。”耶稣的意思是：你使用了祈祷，但不是我设计的那种方式，而是一种虚假的灵性模式。在这段经文的第5至8节，他给我们提供了两种虚假的精神榜样。

然后从第9节到结尾，他给出了自己的精神榜样。现在让我们看看这些虚假的精神榜样，以及他的精神榜样，并且我们会以一些实用的内容作为总结，因为人们一直在催我讲这个。所以当你读到登山宝训时，整篇登山宝训的核心就是实用性。告诉我怎么做。

不要只是让我觉得应该多祷告。怎么做？所以我们先来看看虚假的精神榜样、真实的榜样，以及一些建议来帮助我们实践这些内容。耶稣在这两节经文中给出了两种模式，并且现在请注意，如果你仔细看，你会发现他在第5节说：“你们祷告的时候，不可像假冒为善的人。

”在第7节他又说：“你们祷告的时候，不可像那假冒为善的人。” 他提到了两个群体，在祈祷时不要使用这些模式，否则就像用咖啡机煮茶一样，行不通。第一个模式是宗教性的祈祷。当你祈祷时，不要像假宗教人士那样，他们喜欢在会堂和街角祈祷，好让别人看到。

初读这段经文时，你可能会觉得这是些狂热的文字。他们在会堂里祈祷，人们确实会在那里站立祷告。这指的是正式的礼拜，但还提到街角，立刻让人联想到有人走在街上突然大声祷告，而纽约人可能会说：“这就是纽约。” 但这并不是耶稣想要表达的意思。

“街角”是指城镇广场，街道交汇的地方。这个暗示是这样的：这些人不仅参加正式的崇拜服务，还在社区、宗教活动中带头祈祷。那么这种祈祷有什么问题吗？难道来教堂或会堂祈祷有错吗？

在大型公共活动中领祷有错吗？答案是没有错，但他说这种人没有个人的祈祷生活。你看，他把这和另外一类人作对比，说你在祈祷的时候，要进到你的房间。这些人有公开的祈祷生活，却没有私下的祈祷生活。

他们祈祷的原因是希望在社会中显得合适，被别人看见。祈祷和敬拜在这里的作用就像是让你融入家庭、融入小镇、融入社会秩序、融入族群、融入文化，从而找到自己的位置。就像政治家在演讲结束时说：“愿上帝保佑我们所有人”，他没有真正的祈祷生活，但人们却喜欢这种说法。他们告诉市场调研的人：“我不太喜欢这个，但我也没有祈祷生活。

” 但是大家都感觉更好了。大家感觉更好是因为某种意义上，这为社会秩序披上了宗教的外衣。或者就像这样。世界上普通人的回答是：你为什么是穆斯林？

你为什么是天主教徒？你为什么是长老会教徒？你为什么是浸信会教徒？如果他们诚实地说，那是因为那是他们的背景。

我是意大利人，所以我信仰天主教；我是阿拉伯人，所以我信仰伊斯兰教；我来自田纳西州，所以我信仰浸信会。换句话说，这就是我的族群，这就是我是谁。**这意味着我们不是在谈论那些内心空虚的人。**当一个人的祈祷和敬拜主要是文化性的时，那是因为他们从小就被培养在这种教会氛围中，在这种礼拜仪式中长大，他们的家人、小镇、部落和家庭都是这样的。

当你进入这种环境时，你会有一种内心的平静感。你有什么感觉？你会感到好一些，或者至少有一种稳定感和内心平静的感觉。但耶稣在这里说的不是你在与上帝交往，而是在与一个社会环境交往。

你感到... 你和你的根系相连，因此感觉良好，或者可能有一种怀旧或熟悉感，甚至感觉自己是传统的一部分，但这是一种与传统的联系，或者是与家庭的联系，或者是与根源的联系，或者是与社会秩序的联系，但并不是与神的联系。他说到这一点的标志就是当你独自进入私人祈祷室祷告时，你无话可说。没有渴望去认识他。没有渴望去遇见他。

没有渴望想和他在一起。你根本感觉不到这些。你可能在有麻烦的时候会祷告，但在没有麻烦、没有任何外在压力、没有社会原因、没有家庭原因、没有具体情境的情况下，你完全没有内在的动力去真正认识他、遇见他或看见他。耶稣说，这就是标志——你缺乏一种持续的、增长的、个人的、秘密的、私人的祈祷生活。

你不知道该说什么。当你独自一人时感到无聊。现在，让我们暂时摘掉手套继续说下去。这是耶稣的话。

你怎么知道自己是伪君子？你怎么知道自己是伪君子？你知道什么是伪君子吗？伪君子是指外表和内心不一致的人。

你怎么知道你是伪君子呢？我们不去他去的地方。我们谈论的是性。有人说，他说自己很道德，但私底下却在出轨。

但是耶稣并没有用性来作为检验伪君子的标准。我不是说这是对的，但这不是最明显的标准。另一个说法是让我们看看金钱吧。他说她声称非常虔诚地侍奉神，但她自私地把钱花在自己身上，不施舍给穷人也不捐给教会。

当然，这也是不对的。然而，耶稣说，这并不是关键。这正是你成为虚伪的表现——你没有祈祷生活。我曾在神学院读过一篇由约翰·卫斯理写的讲道，这篇讲道的标题是《虚伪者在祷告上的不足》。

我在读完这篇讲道后，一个月都做噩梦，因为他说的就是这个道理。他说，在基督徒生活中，只有一件事是你不会为了表现而做的。只有一件。那就是秘密祈祷，因为其他一切都在装模作样。

其他一切都是别人能看到的。只有秘密祈祷是只为神、只为祂，不为任何人，甚至不是为自己，只为祂。这是你基督徒生活中的唯一一件你不为了表现而做的事情。因此，如果你做了所有其他的事情但没有秘密祈祷，你的整个基督徒生活都是在装模作样。

承认吧，你没有秘密的祷告生活。他说这是一种虚伪的表现。**这意味着你祈祷的原因是环境使然，而不是出于对神的敬畏。**你在试图…… 好了，你们明白就够了，已经够难过了。

让我们继续。然而，耶稣却转向另一个群体，并在第70节说：“你们祷告的时候，不要像外邦人一样啰嗦。” 这个翻译有点困难。首先，“啰嗦”这个词在希腊文中是一个非常特殊的词汇，在整个希腊文学中只在这里出现过一次，在整本圣经中也只用了一次。

它意味着一种滔滔不绝的言语，是一种狂热的、急切的言语，而不仅仅是很多话。而“外邦人”一词是耶稣使用的ethne这个词，通常也被译为“异教徒”，但在新约中，它通常指的是那些无宗教信仰的人——那些放荡的、不道德的、非宗教的人。那么，为什么耶稣要谈论这种无宗教信仰的祈祷呢？好吧，这里有一个有趣的岔路可以走，但我不打算走。

耶稣在这里说的一点是，实际上并不存在无祷告之心的说法。他真正想表达的是，现在有些自以为是的基督徒多年来这样说过。没有祈祷者和战壕。这种说法确实有点傲慢。

但是耶稣的意思是，祈祷是心灵的自然反应。无论你声称相信什么，无论你对宇宙的看法如何，当你感受到人性，当感到脆弱时，你就无法停止祈祷。无论你说自己信奉什么，总有一些时刻是你无法不祈祷的时候，**这意味着你的内心知道，尽管你想告诉自己不是这样，但上帝存在并且你需要他。**情感的洪流会涌出，不管你是谁，但这并不是全部。

耶稣说：“他们以为在他们的倾诉中会被听见。”罗伯特·沃斯瑙现在，在秋季我引用过他的观点，这是一本非常值得一读的好书。罗伯特·沃斯瑙最近写了一本书叫《后天》，他是宗教社会学领域的领军人物，在普林斯顿大学任教，是一位非常有影响力的学者。他在书中进行了全面的社会学反思和研究，探讨了当今的灵性。

他说，这与这段经文有关联，他认为这个国家过去的精神追求模式是一种他称之为“栖居”的模式，即一种栖居模型。他说，栖居模型是出于家族传统去神圣的地方，听起来像是我们刚刚讨论的内容，宗教的方法。他说，过去的人们会出于家庭和民族的传统去教堂、犹太会堂或大教堂，但他指出，最近两年出现了一种新的版本，是由那些说他们讨厌宗教机构的人所推动的。我是精神上的，不是宗教上的。

每个人都要自己决定什么是对他或她自己来说真实的和正确的，每个人都要自己决定谁是上帝。我自己在构建自己的宗教信仰，但基本上他们说：“我不是宗教的，我是精神上的。”他们非常热衷于祈祷，不去教堂，不想成为那种东西的一部分，但他们喜欢冥想，喜欢各种各样的灵性练习，强调与灵性的接触。不过罗伯特·沃斯现在正确地指出，并且这是很公平的观点，他是个非常谨慎的人，也是位杰出的学者。

他说，在最终分析中，这其实和宗教祈祷并没有太大差别，只是旧版本而已。他称这种模式为“寻求型”灵性，而旧模式则称为“安住型”。一种说法是：“我在这里，这是我所在的地方，这是我的人，这就是我为什么这样祈祷的原因。”另一种则是“旅程型”，它说：“我们永远无法真正到达终点，我们永远不会找到答案，我们只是在不断寻求。

” 他说，一个大问题是，前者是由文化驱动的，而后者则由技术驱动。新灵性非常注重技术手段，有可视化技巧，有放松技巧，极其依赖于技术。但最终，这并不是真的试图接近上帝，而是希望通过这种神圣的东西来达到内心平静和灵性的需求，从而帮助实现个人目标。你看，旧宗教方法基本上是为社会秩序“洗礼”，这也是为什么一些传统的宗教在某种程度上被拒绝的原因之一，因为往往旧的社会秩序中的压迫、不公和偏见都被宗教传统所“洗礼”了。

但有趣的是，新的灵性在很多方面也仅仅是一种精神上的“洗礼”，来实现个人生活的目标。> 他称这种模式为“寻求型”灵性，而旧模式则称为“安住型”。例如，如果你使用现代的灵性技巧，比如说你是个棒球选手，试图用灵性技巧来提高你的棒球水平。但你只是一遍遍地想象自己在家中本垒打。

你知道你在说，这就是我想要的世界，并且我会利用神的力量去实现它。罗伯特·沃斯现在足够聪明地说，这和旧的方法一样肤浅，因为你不是在顺服什么，不是真正改变自己，而是基本上用神来达到自己的目的。耶稣说，他们以为会得到回应是因为他们是父母的孩子。他们认为因为我是谁，我可以做点什么，可以改变一切，可以把世界变成我想要的样子，可以通过想象把它变成我想要的样子，让自己处于实现目标的位置。

耶稣说，不，不，不，不。他说，这两种想法都是错的，是糟糕的榜样。我的模型是这样的。顺便提一下，在主祷文方面，这个夏天我们的讲道团队将会深入讲解主祷文，因为灵性话题现在很火，我们会有许多牧师来讲解它。

但我想说的是一个总结，这当然不是我今年夏天关于主祷文的讲道或任何其他人的讲道的抢风头。但他基本上是这么说的：我的灵性模型是这样的，祈祷的目的到底是什么？祈祷真正是为了得到什么吗？是为了内心的平静吗？

还是为了什么呢？他说，祈祷是为了体验神的友谊和神的主权，这种体验来自于认识到我们是神的儿子。这是一种友谊的经历，也是一种主权的经历，源自于认识到我们的儿子身份。这个夏天你是否在寻找信仰成长的方法？

或者你希望帮助新信徒或孩子理解基督教的核心教义吗？对于许多人来说，夏季可以提供更多的时间来加深我们的信仰，并理解跟随基督意味着什么。这个夏天开始使用的一个很好的资源是新城市 catechism 日课，《神的心智与真理》。这本日课将基督教历史上经典的 catechisms 带入生活，为一年中的每一周提供一个问题供你思考。

在引言中，Tim Keller 阐述了 catechesis 的重要性——这一丰富且社群化的学习和记忆问答的方式，这些问答构成了基督教信仰的基础。每周包括一段经文、一篇祷告以及简短的默想，这将挑战并激励你。附带的注释由如约翰·派博、Tim Keller 和凯文·D.等当代牧师撰写，也有像奥古斯丁、约翰·加尔文和马丁·路德这样的历史人物。此外，我们还为您的礼物准备了一个很棒的配套资源——新城市 catechism 儿童版，帮助福音与生命向全世界的人分享基督之爱。

你发现了吗？老宗教传统的问题是没有友谊，只有外在的形式。这就是为什么没有私生活、没有个人祷告室的原因——一切都是形式上的。但新灵性运动的问题不是没有友谊，而是没有主权，没有人要顺服。

基本上我决定什么是对的和错的，没有友谊，没有主权，因为没有父子关系。首先，我会快速讲一下。第一点是友谊，祈祷的目的。看看主祷文的第一部分，那是什么意思？

“我们在天上的父，愿人都尊你的名为圣。” 我天上的父，你的名是怎样的？你的国降临，你的旨意行在地上，如同行在天上。前半句和我的需要没有关系。

前半句和面包无关，和我的罪无关，和我对人的怒气无关，和我面对挑战所需的力量无关，完全无关。那到底发生了什么？好吧，那么，在祈祷的前半部分，我在做什么？我享受着，我注意到，我为他感到惊奇，我被他所震撼。

好吧，现在这里有个要点，在你请求其他任何事情之前，祈祷的主要目标，或者你应该首先请求的是他。你看，当人们说祈祷没有起作用时，我总是问他们，你到底是什么意思祈祷没有起作用？而他们总是告诉我他们请求却没有得到的东西。但是你看，主的祷告基本上是这样的：你知道你在那里试图做什么吗？

你试图用茶壶泡咖啡。耶稣说，祈祷应该建立的方式是，在你请求其他任何事情之前，首先请求我。你看，如果有谁在这里说祈祷没有为他起作用，我想我要持续不断地问你的问题，日复一日，时复一时，一遍又一遍地问：你是否说过，我要你，我要你在我的生命中，我要你的现实，我要体验到你。那是你的首要目标吗？

不，因为我可以告诉你，如果你做到了这一点，祈祷就不会让你失望了。祈祷主要是为了这个目的。你知道路加福音中的那个讲论主祷文的地方吗？对不起，请原谅我，就是在那里耶稣告诉他们如何祈祷和使用主的祷告。

你看，在路加福音11章之前，有一个关于玛利亚和马大的故事。马大在她家里忙来忙去，她是接待耶稣的那位姐姐，她在做家务，非常烦躁、分心且忙碌等等。耶稣温柔地责备了她，慈爱地责备了她，并说，马大，马大，玛利亚找到了那必须的一件事。现在这真是非常有趣，耶稣基督在这里告诉我们。

所以我们最好仔细看看。你真正需要的只有一样东西，其他一切都是可以商量的。你不需要别的了。如果你有这一样，其他一切就都次要了。

那是什么呢？当他说“非此不可”的时候，他提到马利亚坐在他的脚前听他的话，评论家们都知道这一点。他们会说，耶稣基督如此浸淫于诗篇之中，不可能没有在脑海中想到诗篇27章第4节中大卫所说的一句话：“我一心寻求的是耶和华。”耶稣说，大卫就是这样说的。

而大卫是一个有很多问题的人，他总是逃亡，总是处于危机之中，他是国王，是将军，经历了许多事情，但他却说：“我真正需要的只有一样东西。”大卫没有首先祈求安全，没有首先祈求保护，也没有首先祈求成功。在他所经历的一切困难中，他说：“如果我的灵魂能够感受到内在的甜美和荣耀，如果我能看到他的美丽，而不仅仅是知道他，而是实际地品尝并看见他的美丽，那么其他一切都不会困扰我，不会吸引我，不会震惊我，我会过上自由自在的生活。” 耶稣就是这样对玛丽说的，也是对你说的。

然后就是主祷文了，因为这就是它的重点和背景——友谊。让我们继续谈友谊吧，因为没有友谊是不行的。你不能在没有寻求到他的友谊之前就去祈求其他任何东西，必须疯狂地追求与他建立亲密的关系，体验他的圣洁和爱，而不仅仅是知道这些。这是第一个要点。

其次，耶稣说，这与宗教式的做法完全不同。除了与我们天父的亲密关系之外，你还可以得到他的主权。主祷文的第二个目的是“愿你的国降临，愿你的旨意行在地上如同天上”。现在说到第二点，这很可怕。

在祈求你想要的东西之前，耶稣说你需要先经历这个过程。这就是你**真正的问题所在。所以我们直接奔向每日的面包，奔向其他一切，因为我们就是**这么想的。我们说：“我害怕，我很担心，我很生气，我知道这个世界应该怎样。

”于是祈祷时从我们心中涌出了一大堆话语。主啊，请一定要这样做，一定要那样做。她必须活下去，她必须看到这一切发生，我必须进去，这笔钱必须出现，我没有其他办法了。这是一大堆话语，而且是滔滔不绝的。

没错，我们在祷告中就是这样喋喋不休地重复着我们害怕的事情。你知道吗？如果我们直接祈求每日的面包，当我们祈祷结束时，我们会更加担心，而不是感到轻松。我们只是在重述那些让我们恐惧不已的事物。

真是太好了。当我们跌倒了，当我们在审视那些对我们不好的人时，我们就会更加怨恨、愤怒和自责。哦主，我真抱歉，我真的抱歉，我不知道自己为什么会这样做，话语如洪流般倾泻而出，喋喋不休。但耶稣说，这里有一个更首要的：不是祈求，而是要将自己从神的位置上挪开。

直到你祷告时，你内心自然的姿态才会改变。如果你仔细聆听，你会听到它。你的心总是这样诉说着：“我的国降临了，愿你的旨意成就。”“我的国降临了，愿你的旨意成就。

” 实际上，这就是你真正的问题的根源。最近我在研读创世记50章时才恍然大悟。在创世记50章中，约瑟被他的兄弟出卖，被卖为奴隶，甚至他们曾试图杀死他、毁掉他的生活。但到了最后，他掌握了权力，并有权报复他们。

当他们的父亲去世后，他们请求不要伤害自己。约瑟把他们都叫到一起，他说了什么？他说：“我已经饶恕你们了。”这需要很多努力，但他已经饶恕了他们。

不，他怎么说的？他说：“我是在神的位置上吗？”约瑟的所有宽恕、他的平静和他没有恐惧的根源，正是当你害怕时，你知道为什么害怕？你为何担忧？

你为何焦虑不安？有些人现在就是如此。你知道为什么吗？因为你确信事情应该怎样进行。

你怎么知道呢？你怎么知道事情应该怎样进行？你以为自己在神的位置上。你以为。

有些人为某些人做了某些事而感到怨恨，这些人没有受到应有的惩罚。你为何如此怨恨？不是因为情况，也不是因为他们。而是因为你认为你知道他们应得什么。

你以为你知道吗？约瑟说：“我从神的位置上走了下来，这才是我不快乐的主要原因。这才是我害怕的主要原因。这也是我会生气的主要原因。

我已经出来了，我已经离开了。” 你怎么知道呢？你看这个模型的第二部分是你要经历这种主权。你必须愿意说，而这只能在祷告中发生。

如果你愿意追求它，这会通过圣灵发生。如果你看到这一点，在你做任何其他事情之前，你必须要这样做。你必须对主说：“求圣灵显明给我最重要的事，让我知道你是神而我不是。” 但我并不相信这一点。

这就是我无法克服罪疚感的原因，因为我感觉我必须活出自己的样子。我必须成为自己的救赎者。这也是我无法克服愤怒的原因，我知道那些人的确该受到惩罚。这也是我无法克服忧虑和焦虑的原因，因为我知道世界的走向。

我知道。约瑟说：“离开吧，这真可怕。” 马丁·路德曾经对你们说过这样的话，因为他有个朋友菲利普·马兰辛托恩非常糟糕，他可能是因为压力太大而去世了，就像有些人一样。他的名字是菲利普·马兰辛托恩。

偶尔，马丁·路德会过来拍拍他的背，说：“让菲利普不要统治这个世界。” 换句话说，马丁说，菲利普的问题本质上是神学问题，而不是所有的心理问题是神学问题。唯一治愈你心灵的神学方式就是祷告。通过审视他的神圣性、王权和他的圣洁。

为什么那些东西放在开头？因为你要治愈你的内心，调整你的视角，并愿意说：“你是主。”当这一切发生时，你才能开始那种大生活，没有什么能压倒你，没有什么能战胜你，你说。最后，这种转变如何实现呢？

耶稣说一个原因就是宗教人士在祷告生活中缺乏友谊。有趣的是，非宗教的人反而有私人的祷告生活。他们沉思，寻求，但没有敬拜。**这意味着他们认为每个人都必须自己决定什么是正确和错误的。**

你知道**这意味着什么吗？你不想面对一个能与你对立的神。**你不希望面对一个说“我是神，你是凡人”的神。当你声称不相信传统，不相信任何形式的权威，并且必须自己决定对错时， 你实际上把自己置于了一生中神的位置。

祝你好运吧，你根本不适合这个职位。你知道不适合某个职位是什么感觉吗？什么也不是。你可能有过一些不太合适的职位经历，但没有一个像这样。

而耶稣说：“友谊是第一位的主权。”在寻求任何东西之前，你必须体验这种主权，但是你说：这怎么可能呢？我怎么能如此亲密地认识他？我又怎么能如此信任他？

你听到了吗？宗教人士会问：我怎么能如此亲密地认识他？他告诉人们要称呼神为“我们的父亲”。如果你只听到我说“我的Kathy”，即使你完全不认识我，你也知道Kathy一定是我的妻子或女儿。

因为这种称谓只有在非常亲密的关系中才会使用，而且我绝不会当众说出这样的话。为什么呢？你觉得那样说会很尴尬，你不会在公共场合用那种语言称呼对你重要的人。这是一种亲密的语言。

耶稣说：“你开始时可以叫神为你的神、父亲。”宗教人士会问：我怎么能知道那是真的？我怎么知道呢？我在努力做好人，希望神会垂青于我。

我怎么能知道呢？如何与他亲密相待？另一方面，非宗教的灵性人士可能会说：“你说要信任他，就说他是上帝吧。我心想：哇，等等，你怎么能那样信任他呢？

” 答案在于福音中的收养之道。第一个词是：不是我的王、我的主，而是我的父、我们的父。成为基督徒的方式并不是通过努力和技巧，也不是靠做好事。收养之道是这样的：当我对神说：“父亲，请接纳我，因着耶稣所做的。

”那一刻，圣经上说我们就获得了儿子的身份。有时我会遇到女性，她们会问为什么总是用“儿子”这个词而不考虑其他人呢？其实这并非不敏感。让我告诉你我坚持使用这个词语的原因。

因为在新约时代，收养意味着被收养的人不仅与你亲密无间，还能成为你的继承人，但那时只有男性才能被收养，拥有儿子的身份。然而，保罗、约翰和其他新约作者却大胆地说：当你接受基督为救主时，无论你是富是贫、男是女，神都会赐给你儿子的身份和全部权利。当你知道这一点时，你就能与神亲密地交往。有人可能会说：“我不确定这是否足够。

”如何可能呢？我怎么可能对神有这样的信心，与他有如此的亲密关系？答案在于：当耶稣基督来到西门彼得身边，要跌倒的时候，他对西门说：“西门，西门，撒但想要得着你，如同筛麦子一样，但我为你祈求。”所以当你悔改、恢复时，你要坚固弟兄。

耶稣说：“我为你祈求了，也许你会转回。”希伯来书7章说：当你成为基督徒时，耶稣基督永远活着为我们代求。那么“代求”是什么意思呢？**这意味着只意味着祷告。**

希伯来书7章说，耶稣基督已经重新定向了他的生活，所以他只有一个追求。他只为这个而活。我们知道他在做什么。圣经告诉我们，他总是为我们祈祷。

他站在父面前，仿佛是这样。而且他不断地在说：“我希望这些事情发生在他们的生命中。”“我希望那些事情发生在他们的生命中。”“我希望他们生命中有好事发生。

”基本上，当我们祷告时，上帝会说：“我已经准备好要把许多不可思议的事情放进你的生活中，不是因为你有什么功德，而是因为他的祷告生活。你微不足道的、最渺小的祷告生活，只要你开始祈祷，你就将处于一个准备接收这些即将进入你生活的美好事物的位置上。” 只是你的祷告生活。如果你了解他的祷告生活对你意味着什么，如果你看到他对你的祷告生活，如果你知道你有这种保证，那么你就能体验到他的友谊和敬拜。

有人问：“哦，是吗？那怎么办呢？” 我可以给你一个小小的练习：每天十五分钟，不包括圣经研读，在你看完经文之后，不要去查经文、坐下来研究一切，然后祈祷两分钟。这并不是祷告。

在你完成圣经研读后，花十五分钟时间，首先你需要倾听再发言。这是主祷文的全部要点。在你向他祈求任何事情之前，前半部分都在说什么？注意他是谁，聆听他是谁，听到他是谁，然后作出回应。

这就是主祷文。主祷文是这样：“看这个、看这个、听这个、听这个。” 现在我要对你们说一些话。主祷文的整个要点在于，祷告是对神的回答，是对神话语的回应。

它不仅仅是说话。如果你有一个与这位极其强大的人物的约会，你不会坐下来只说“我有很多事情要告诉你”，然后不停地讲，希望他能理解并听到你说的话。我的时间到了。不是这样，而是你应该这样做：先研读圣经经文，然后十五分钟的祷告时间就开始了。

首先，在五到七分钟内，向这段经文提出两个问题。你告诉我在他身上看到了什么样的主？又在你身上看到了什么样的主？然后慢慢地默读这段经文，不是吗？

慢慢读这段经文，并带着这两个问题倾听他的声音。然后写下几个答案后，就为这些事祷告。赞美他并感谢他向你揭示的关于他的真理。承认并祈求那些与你有关的事。

当这十五分钟结束时，你可以去做其他事情了。你可以继续做你的祈祷清单。你知道，祝福妈妈和爸爸，做好这一切。但在那十五分钟内，你可以进行圣经研读。

但是你知道吗？你们当中很多人在做圣经研读和祈祷清单时，并没有真正地祷告。你们并没有体验到他的友谊，也没有从认识到自己的儿子身份中体验到敬拜。确保你敞开心扉。

每天花十五分钟倾听这段文字中的他的话语，然后回应它。坚持每天十五分钟，连续三十天。你可以选择诗篇或约翰福音，如果你真的不知道该去哪里开始，就来告诉我发生了什么。祷告是有效的，只要你首先寻求他的友谊和敬拜。

他从不拒绝这些祈祷。让我们祷告。父亲，求你帮助我们成为祷告的人。在场有些人甚至不确定自己相信什么。

唯一的方法就是通过祷告找到答案。在场很多人确信自己有所信仰，但都是理论上的知识。每个人都需要回去祷告，在这里需要找到那种根本性的内在体验，无论我们是基督徒还是非基督徒或不知道自己是什么身份。父亲，请为我们祷告。

你的儿子，有史以来最伟大的人，总是不断地祷告。现在我们知道原因了。他为你们而祷告。了解他为我们代祷，并且只有当我们知道他为我们代祷时，我们才能过上一种祈祷的生活。

所以求你帮助我们达到这个目标。我们在耶稣的名里祷告，阿们。感谢您收听蒂姆·凯勒在《福音与生活播客》上的讲道。如果您希望看到更多人通过福音中心的信息和资源得到鼓励，请考虑成为《福音与生活》的月度合作伙伴。
