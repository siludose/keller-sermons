# The Cosmic Spirit / The Cosmic Spirit

## Chinese Translation / 中文翻译 / English Transcript

Welcome to Gospel and Life! Who is the Holy Spirit? And why is the Spirit's work so vital to the Christian life?

The Bible tells us the Holy Spirit is not just a vague force, but a person who works in the lives of Christians in profound ways. Today Tim Keller is exploring how the Spirit calls us to faith, unites us together, equips us with gifts and shapes us to be more like Christ. Tonight's scripture is from the Book of Romans, chapter 8, verses 15 through 27.

For you did not receive a Spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship, and by him we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirits that we are God's children. Now if we are children, then we are heirs, heirs of God and coheirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings an order that we may also share in his glory.

I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. The creation waits an eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it.

And hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God. We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time. Not only so, but we ourselves who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.

We are in this hope we were saved, but hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he already has? But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently.

In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express. And He who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit because the Spirit intercedes for the saints and accordance with God's will.

This is the Word of the Lord. We've been doing a series on the Holy Spirit and tonight we come to the end of the series. And we've looked at a number of pretty well known things that the Holy Spirit does in us and for us.

He calls us and enables us to believe. He regenerates us and creates Christ-like character in us. He unites us one to another inside the church.

He empowers us with his gifts so that we can serve people around us in life-changing ways. Those are all pretty well known, but tonight we look at a passage that tells us about the ultimate thing, the final thing, if the Holy Spirit does for us. And it's maybe the most astonishing of all, and not nearly as well known.

Let's notice from the text what we learn here is what the Spirit will do for us in the future, what the Spirit therefore can do for us in the present, and how we can let the Spirit do that in our lives. What He will do for us in the future, what He therefore can do for us now in the present, and how we can let the Spirit do that in our lives. What are we talking about?

Well, first, what the Spirit will do in the future. And in a nutshell, chapter 8 of Romans is an amazing chapter, and a little further down on chapter 8 and verse 30, we read where it says, he, the Lord, those he called, he also justified, but those he justified, he also glorified. He doesn't just stop at justification, he justified as he also glorifies.

We are going to be glorified. One of the most confusing things about the reading Paul is he constantly changes the tenses on salvation on us. So sometimes he says, you have been saved, we have been saved, we have been redeemed, we are redeemed, past tense, then suddenly all of a sudden he turns around and says, it's sometimes in the same sentence, but we will be redeemed, we will be saved.

So which is it? In fact, he does it here, did you see it? Because in verses 14, 15, and 16, he says, as believers in Christ, we are his children.

We have been adopted. We have received the Spirit of Sonship. We have been adopted.

We are his children. And yet, look at verse 23, it says, we wait eagerly for our adoption. There he did it again.

What's the matter with this man? And the answer is the richness of the concept. See, the word redemption, especially that is the word that's operative in here, means to be purchased, ransomed out of bondage, to be bought out of slavery, to be ransomed out of bondage or slavery.

Now, the being bondage means to literally be in chains, not to be free, to be who you are supposed to be, not to be free, to do the things you're supposed to do. And what we know from the Bible throughout, even at the very beginning in Genesis chapter 3, is that when we sinned and lost our relationship with God, we lost all other relationships. When we lost our relationship with God, everything else broke.

Nothing else is the way God designed it to be, and therefore, we are in bondage in every area of our life, where we are not free to be all the things that God meant us to be. In other words, we are in bondage psychologically and sociologically and relationally and physically. What do I mean?

Even the best Christians, even the most mature Christians, still experience an enormous amount of bondage to fear, anxiety, hardness of heart. They certainly experience a certain amount of freedom, but they still experience that. Even the best churches still experience a great deal of conflict and egos and fights and prejudice.

And even the very best people still get sick, get old, and die. And none of those things are the way God originally designed them to be. None of them, all that suffering, all that brokenness is not what God meant us to be.

And therefore, the minute you become a Christian, all your sins are forgiven. There's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. God sees you in Christ, which means He treats you as if you've done everything Christ has done.

You are absolutely as justified in His sight, the first moment you believe and as loved as you will be a billion years from now. And in all, in that sense, and in that's a profound sense, you are saved, past ends. And yet, though you have been redeemed, in that sense, you still need redemption.

They're still bondage. We have been redeemed, but we need to be redeemed, and we will be. Because we're told in verse 17, though we're in suffering, though we're in bondage, we will be glorified, which means all the effects of sin, all the bonds will be over, and in particular, it's verse 23, we will have our bodies redeemed.

We await eagerly the redemption, the final adoption, the final salvation, the redemption of our bodies. Now, the Greeks, the old Greek philosophers, believe the body was bad, and the ultimate salvation was for the soul to be freed from the body. The body is bad, the body is broken, the body is weak, and the ultimate salvation is to be freed from the body.

And I must tell you, the older I get, the more I sympathize with that idea, the more you see me. Because if you're chronically ill or if you're just getting older and you're just, and you just sense more and more the weakness of your body, you can start to say, this is, this isn't, the body is my enemy. It's a prison house.

Salvation would be to be free of it, but that's not how the Bible sees it. Do you see what this is saying? Your final redemption is not even going to heaven.

Your final redemption is at the end of time when you're resurrected and you have a new and glorious body. That's the final joy, the final blessing. That's the fullness of what God wants you to have.

That's the fullness of the joy and the flourishing that God wants you to know as a human being. And this is the work of the Spirit. It's the Spirit doing this.

Romans 8 verse 11. It's a little higher up than what we began where we began to read says this. And if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit.

Who lives in you? The Spirit that comes into you when you first believe some day is going to transform your body. Philippians 3.21, then the body of our humiliation.

This frail form will be conformed to the image of Christ's glory. You say, what will that be like? Well, we actually know a little bit about it.

Not only do we have Jesus Christ and what He was like after His resurrection, and He's the first fruit from the dead, which means He's the one person that we have some idea about what it means to have a glorious resurrected body, free from the imperfection, free from all bondage to decay, free from anything wrong. But we also have 1 Corinthians 15 where Paul says some of these great things. This mortal body will put on immortality.

It is sown in dishonor, it will be raised in splendor. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power, it is sown in natural body, it is raised in spiritual body, right there. See what that's saying?

Here's your resurrected glory future. Do you want to know what it looks like? Do you know what it's going to be like?

You probably can think too much about this because you can get into speculation what we would be able to do this or that. But our problem is that we actually think too little about it. Here's three things we know about your future resurrected body.

It'll be our body, it'll be a beautiful body, it'll be a powerful body. It'll be our body, remember what Paul said. This mortal body will put on immortality.

When Jesus rose from the dead and he appeared as he was disciples, he still had his nail prints, remember that? How could that be? It's because it was his body, his mortal body putting on immortality.

He was still him, that's the reason why when people looked at Jesus after his resurrection. At first they didn't recognize Him and then they did. You know one of the most irritating things for those of you who are like maybe in your 20s, you're constantly running into older people in their 40s and 50s who knew you when you were a kid but hadn't seen you since you grew up.

It's a little icky because you come up to them and you say, hi, do you know me? No. Well, I'm so and so and then they look at you, they haven't seen you since your 8th, now you're 25 or something like that.

And they go, you're little Jimmy or little Sally and it's really awful, it's really awful. But the point is it is still you, it is your 8 year old self transformed by a process of growth. They can see it, your body, your face, your eyes, oh yeah, how about look at you?

That's what it's going to be like. We're going to be ourselves, we're really going to be us. I mean that's an amazing, there is no other religion in the world that has that kind of self.

We're going to be us, it's going to be our body putting on immortality. You know in this world we have that idea but in that world it'll be like when we see each other we're going to say, it is you, I always know you could be like this. I saw glimpses of it but now look at you, it'll be you, it'll be us.

So it'll be our body, secondly it'll be a beautiful body, it's sewn in dishonor, Paul says and it's raised in splendor. In this world there are people with ugly souls that have beautiful bodies and there's people with beautiful souls that have ugly bodies but not then. C.

S. Lewis says, if we let him he will make the feeblest and filthiest of us into a dazzling, radiant immortal creature, pulsating all through with such energy and joy and wisdom and love as we cannot now imagine. He can make us into bright, stainless mirrors which reflect back to God perfectly though of course on a smaller scale his own boundless power and delight and goodness.

That is what we are in for, nothing less, a mirror reflecting back but there's another way to do it. His friend, Lewis's friend J. R.

Tolkien in one place and one of his fictional pieces, one of his characters dies and when he dies he lies in state and this is what it says about. Tolkien and Lewis were Christians struggling to come to grips with what the future glory looked like and we're told this man dies and he's lying in state and this is what it's how he describes him. A great beauty was revealed in him and all who came there looked on him in wonder, for they saw that the grace of his youth, the valor of his manhood, the wisdom and majesty of his age were all blended together and long there he lay an image of the kings of men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.

So what Tolkien is trying to get across is for example see there is a beauty that children have that they lose but then there's another beauty that young men and women have you know in their prime, physical prime that the children didn't have and that older people don't have but then there's a majesty and a wisdom and a nobility about older people that the younger people don't have but in all these beauties and these glories of course are just sort of spread out but then they'll all be united. They'll all be united. Paul says we will be different, we'll be ourselves and yet he says star differs from star and glory.

Every star is different, they're all, every single one of them is different. They'll all be different but will be stars and not only that will not only be our bodies and not only will be beautiful bodies but they will be powerful. Paul says it is sewn in weakness.

The body is sewn in weakness but it's raised in power and then he goes a little further and says it's sewn in natural body, it's raised a spiritual body. What is that? In fact think about that, isn't that a category mistake?

It's raised a spiritual body, that doesn't make any sense. See in our categories you either a spirit or your body, you're either a spirit or your body. Well come on Paul, will we be spirits or will we be bodies and Paul says yeah.

In fact Jesus comes through the doors, he comes through locked doors and they say oh it's a ghost remember this, Luke 24, the resurrected Christ comes through locked doors and they say oh as a ghost he says give me a fish and he eats the fish, he says I have a spirit have not flesh and bones, touch me, watch me, a spiritual body, run it not be weary, walk and not faint, right now you've got five senses, what if there is a thousand senses will have? Who knows? Let us know, let us now draw the veil over this because I don't know that we can, we know much more in the way of details.

But do you think about your future, resurrected, perfect bodies and glory cells? I'm sure it's possible to think too much about it but I don't think that's most of, I don't think that's the problem that most of us have. The reason why you're so angry because you haven't lost the weight and it looks like you're never going to be as good looking or as fit or as glorious as you want to be is because you're not thinking.

We need to be good stewards of our body, be as good a steward as you possibly can but don't put your hopes there. The power you want, the glory you want, you know, there's a you in there that will never come out till this moment, till the spirit gives life to your mortal body, to the redemption we wait and eat your longing for the redemption of our bodies. But that's not all by the way, that is not all.

The world in which we're going to live when the spirit does its work is a renewed natural world. Verse 19, just for a minute, just to point out that along with the resurrection of our bodies comes verses 19, 20 and 21, which is absolutely astonishing. Tomorrow is giving Tuesday and we want you to know about a special opportunity we have this year.

As you may know, gospel and life supports Redeemer City to City, a ministry dedicated to growing gospel movements in cities around the world through church planting. City to City was co-founded by Tim Keller and he cared deeply about this mission. And this coming year at a 2026 training event in Kenya, City to City will help train, coach and support two cohorts of 20 pastors planting churches all over Africa.

This giving Tuesday, we have a goal to raise $150,000 to help sponsor the church planters attending this training intensive in Nairobi, Kenya, so that City to City can help and support these church planters to start churches across Africa. This work is vital to the spread of the gospel in African cities from Kampala to Lagos to Johannesburg. So, as you think about how you may give on giving Tuesday, please consider making a gift to gospel in life.

Every dollar we receive on giving Tuesday will go directly to the work City to City is doing to help start new churches in Africa in 2026. To make a gift tomorrow, visit gospelonlife.com slash Tuesday. Again, as gospelonlife.com slash Tuesday.

And thank you for your generous and faithful support of this ministry. Now, here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's message.

1921, what's it say? It says the creation, and that's by the way, the natural world. That's the mountains and the animals, you know, and the trees.

It says the creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to frustration not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it in hope, that the creation itself will be liberated from bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God. What?

What? It says three things. And actually, we don't know much about those three things, but we do know these three things.

It says that nature, the natural world, is not what it should be because of us. Somehow, our sin has brought about a fallenness in nature, so even nature is not what it should be. It's frustrated.

It's not all that God meant it to be. It's in bondage to decay. That's the first thing.

Secondly, it knows it. It knows it's not what it should be, and it's longing to be liberated. And what in the world does Paul mean by that?

How could the trees in the animal? What is he saying? And of course, on the one hand, I hope you know, he's not doing fairy tale stuff.

He's not saying, well, you know, the trees in the animals could talk, but when you're around they don't. He's not saying that, but I'll tell you what he is saying. He is saying that the creation has a life of its own.

It's made also by God to glorify him, just like you are. From 19 says the heavens, this natural world glorifies God, and as such, they are fellow creatures, the trees in the animals, and they have a life of their own, and they deserve an enormous amount of respect. But here's one of the reasons why.

Somehow the creation, in its own way, knows it's creator better than you and I. Some years ago, that's what it's saying. Some years ago, remember, Elizabeth Elley had a teacher of mine at Gordon Conwell Seminary years ago.

Someone said, if you understood these things, she said, you would be humble before a very clam. You know why? Because the clams are doing a better job of being the clams, God meant them to be, than you are, being the man or the woman God meant you to be.

You fall far shorter from what we're supposed to be. You fall short. Are you the man God wants you to be?

But no, clams are much closer. They're glorifying God far more than you are. They, in a sense, know the creation knows there's something wrong, and it's long for the resurrection in a way the human race is not.

But when did you see the last line there, the last part? The creation will be liberated from its bondage decay, decay how? It'll be brought into our freedom, and what that means is.

And the Holy Spirit descends upon us to give us the redemption, the final redemption, the final glorification of ourselves and our bodies. It's going to be an explosion of such love and power and glory that will bring all of nature with it. Nature will come into what it should be on our co-tales.

Isn't this something? And let me just do a little reasoning with you for a second. He's saying, God says, for example, in Exodus 19 to his people, you are my treasured possession though the whole earth is mine, Exodus 19.

You are my treasured possession to the whole earth is mine. What he's saying is, as much as I love the earth, as much as I love the stars and the moons, as much as I love the mountains and the trees and the animals, as much as I love the earth, I love you the most. You are the most treasured possession, and you know what this means?

It's nature that actually comes in on our co-tales, what that means is this. It's astounding to me when you go out and look at the beauty of nature, when you look at the beauty of the mountains and the beauty of the ocean to think that it's just a shadow of what it's going to be. Current nature is just a shadow of its future, glorious self, right?

And yet we are going to be more glorious than the future, renewed nature. And that's what the Holy Spirit will do. Because the Holy Spirit's job is to get rid of the suffering, get rid of the bondage, get rid of the brokenness, get rid of the groaning.

That's what it's going to do in the future, so you say, ah, does that mean that's it? We just have to wait for that. We're groaning now, we're suffering now.

Notice that? We in really groan, nature is groaning. And the word groaning, by the way, that comes up three or four times in here is a word that means to be in pain.

People groan when they're dying, people groan when they're in labor, people groan when they're in terrible, searing pain. Now we live in a time of groaning now, we groan, nature groans. So we say, okay, eventually all the groaning will be over, all the suffering will be over, that's the job of the Spirit wonderful, but right now we're on our own, no.

Here we are in point two, by the way, those of you who care. The Holy Spirit's job is to deal with suffering and groaning. It's to deal with the brokenness of our lives.

That's what we're being told, and eventually he's going to deal with it completely, but he doesn't leave us on our own now, oh no. He's already in our lives to help us with the groaning. We groan inwardly and we're in trouble.

You know, remember the line from the great poet, it's, you know, things fall apart. The center cannot hold. Mayor Anarchy is loose upon the world.

That's true. Everything's falling apart. Your body's falling apart.

Your relationships are falling apart. Your families are falling apart. Your communities are falling apart.

Everything's falling apart. Institutions, movements, they all fall apart. He said, what do you mean?

They die. People move. People fight.

There's an entropy about everything in this world. We groan. Things are always falling apart, but the Holy Spirit has come into our lives as the first fruits of that future glory.

See, verse 23, not only so, but we ourselves who have the first fruits of the Spirit. That word first fruit is so crucial. What that first fruit means, the first day's gathering from the harvest, even though they're going to spend two more weeks and they're going to bring in all the wheat or they're going to bring in all the corn.

But the first day, you gather the corn or the wheat that's coming, you gather some now and you eat it. It's a foretaste of the future feast. It's a down payment on the future fortune.

It's a real piece of the future. And what we're told is, with the Holy Spirit, this wonderful person and power who in the future is going to deal with our groanings and suffering completely is in our lives now. We get a foretaste of that glory that enables us to handle the groanings and suffering of life now.

That's what this text is telling us. And in two ways, I'll use the image of sailing and rowing. You know, sailing, you move through because the wind is to your back.

In rowing, you've got no wind or maybe the wind in your face, but with exertion, you can still get home. So when you're in the midst of groaning and suffering, there's two ways that the Holy Spirit helps you, but He does. The first one is at the top versus 15, 16, 17.

It says, the Spirit bears witness with our spirits that we're children of God. It shores us that we're His children. In fact, it says, the Spirit testifies with our spirit that we, by Him, by the Spirit, we cry Abba.

The word Abba is the Aramaic term for daddy or papa. And what that means is, the Spirit gives us such confidence that God loves us, that we're able to rely on Him and reach out to Him the way a little child reaches out to the Father. And see, that's what I mean by sailing.

Sometimes, in spite of all the troubles around us, God gives us this joy, this sense of His reality, by the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Sonship, crying Abba, assurance that we're His, but not always. Sometimes the Holy Spirit helps us in more difficult times than that. Sometimes the only way to get home is not through sailing because nothing's working.

Somebody of the things that the Holy Spirit does, He changes you through the fruit of the Spirit. He illuminates you by helping you understand God. He empowers you to use your gifts, but sometimes nothing's going right at all.

You're not seeing anybody change your life. God doesn't seem real to you, prayer is dry. You're not getting any prayers answered.

And yet the Spirit doesn't abandon you. Look at verse 26 and 27, in the same way, there's just 26, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express.

Sometimes we don't even know what to pray for. See, that's where we're in the depths. We don't even know what to pray for.

We're so overwhelmed with our troubles. We're groaning, you might say, so deeply and so loudly. And yet the Spirit is with us in those times, and I think over the years as I've thought about that, I, in other words, sometimes the Spirit doesn't give us the joy that knows no bounds.

Sometimes the Spirit just gives us the peace that passes understanding so we can keep rowing, so we can just keep doing the next thing, so we can just know God's with us even now we don't feel them. You know how many of those Psalms, there's 150 Psalms, but I tell you, an awful lot of, like half of them, or the Psalmist starts off by wrestling unhappy, angry, what's going on? I don't understand.

Things are terrible. Oh, Lord, why are you letting all this happen? But the very end, he says, he wrestles through the end and says, but I know I believe I will see the goodness of the Lord and the land of the living.

And I think what he's, what happens is he just knows in his soul in spite of the fact that everything else seems to be saying there is no God or God doesn't care or who cares about God in his soul, he says, no, no, no, no, no, I know, I know, I know he's there, I know he's not going to leave me like this, I'm going to do the next thing, I'm going to pray, I'm going to read my Bible even though I'm not getting anything out of it. You're rowing, and it's because of the Spirit's there helping you. The Spirit cares about your groaning and your suffering, that's his job.

Some day to end it all, but even now to help you. Now let's not, we're not done, and here's the reason why. If you're a New Yorker is your practical, and New Yorkers say, this is all very inspiring, but how do I really, how do I actually do this?

How do I do this? You talk about this wonderful future and this wonderful future, but it's supposed to be somehow helping me now. I don't see how.

How can I know? Well, here's the way. The thing that activates the future so that it affects you now is assured hope.

Verse 24, 25, in this hope we are saved, but if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently. There's your, that's what you need, patience, poise, stick tillidiveness, how? It's through hope.

Do you know how important hope is? Hope is an assured future. Imagine two women, and both of them have a purse, and in that purse is all the assets and money they have in the world.

Everything they have in the world is in that purse, $1,000 in cash, that's it, they both have $1,000 in cash, that's all they have. The difference is that woman knows that tomorrow, for some reasons, a $10 million will be wired into her bank account. And the other woman knows that there's nothing coming from anybody for the indefinite future.

And imagine those two women go out in New York City and they both have the very same experience somebody snatches their purse, their purses are lost, they're taken, they're stolen. How are they going to respond to that? I can tell you this, the woman who knows that tomorrow, $10 million is coming to her bank account, says, what an inconvenience, oh well.

And the other woman is in total despair. Do you know why? Same circumstances, why is the response so different?

Because what you know about the future completely determines how you process the present. What you know about the future, your understanding of your own future completely determines how you process the present. How can you know that the redemption of your body is coming?

How can you know that that's your future? If you knew it, if you were sure of it, you could face anything because a whole lot better than $10 million is coming into your bank account. How can you be sure?

Here's how you can be sure. Many people, commentators have been wondering, so over the years, how could the Spirit groan? You notice in verse 26, it says that when the Spirit is with us and all of our trouble, it says, the Spirit intercedes for us with groans, which means the Spirit is suffering.

And many commentators are saying, how could the divine and mortal Spirit of God suffer? Jesus, in Mark chapter 7, takes a little deaf mute, a man who's been really suffered his whole life aside. He wants to heal him.

And as he's about to heal him, he looks to heaven, and he groans, the same word. That means he's in pain. Why?

Why doesn't he just say, ha ha, way to you see what I'm going to do? Why? Why is he groaning in pain?

Well, the first answer is, because here's a man who's so loving and so vulnerable in his love, that he can emotionally identify with a suffering man that he's just met. And he feels the man's suffering himself. But the ultimate reason is he knows that in order to deliver him and us from his groaning and suffering, Jesus is himself going to have to be plunged into suffering and groaning to deficit.

No one else has ever been, you know, sent. Because when Jesus on the cross says, my God, my God, why has the offer shaken me? He's quoting Psalm 22, right?

But Psalm 22, verse 1, which would have been in Jesus head as he's dying, here's the full verse. My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me?

So far from the words of my groaning, Jesus groaned in pain and got abandoned him. I'm groaning and got abandoned him. Why?

Because he got the abandonment that our sins deserve so that you can know, know, that whenever you groan, God will not abandon you, that he's with you. So you can't face the groaning and suffering of this life without certainty about your future. And you can't be certain about your future unless you know that because Jesus Christ died for you and went through that for you, that even though you fail and even though you don't live the life you ought to live and even though your faith is imperfect and even though your repentance needs to be repented of, God is there with you, the Holy Spirit is there with you.

He will not abandon you. The implications of this are astounding, are they not? If God loves the world, this material world like this, should we care for creation and environment?

Yes. If God only, of all the religions of the world, only the Bible says that this world is permanent and this material world is a permanent and that's a terrific incentive to fight against disease and hunger, is it not? And if you're facing death, what better?

You can laugh in the face of death with this. And if any of you are chronically sick or even just getting old and almost come to the place where you feel like my body is my enemy, it's not. I want you to hear that.

It's not. It's sin and evil in your body that's the enemy but you're sin and evil's in your soul and it's in the world and we are without hope unless he gives us the victory, oh God, he must give us the victory and he will. Let us pray.

Our Father, help us take the theology of this passage. It should make us zealous for caring for material needs. It should make us powerful in the face of our own sickness and even impending death.

It should fill us with such hope that we are able to face the worst groaning and suffering because we know that someday your spirit will end it all. Father, we like the rest of creation long for the final redemption of our bodies and until then, holy spirit, help us, help us to have the joy and the peace of past understanding and the midst of what we have to face. Thank you for all these assurances.

Make us people with zeal and joy but who also know how to weep with those who weep because we know these great truths, we pray this in Jesus' name, Amen. Thanks for joining us here on the Gospel and Life Podcast. We hope that today's teaching encouraged you to go deeper into God's Word.

欢迎来到《福音与生命》！圣灵是谁？为什么圣灵的工作对基督徒的生命如此重要？圣经告诉我们，圣灵不仅是一个模糊的力量，而是一个在基督徒生活中以深刻方式工作的有位格的人。

今天提摩太·凯勒将探讨圣灵如何呼召我们归信、使我们联合在一起、赋予我们恩赐，并塑造我们成为更多像基督的人。今晚的经文来自罗马书第八章第15至27节。你们所领受的不是奴仆的心，仍旧害怕；但你们领受了神的儿子的灵，可以作儿子；既然是儿子，就靠神为后嗣。圣灵与我们的心同证我们是神的儿女。

你们若因基督成为神的儿女，那就算是承受家业的，是神的后嗣，也是基督的同工，以致你们也受苦，也为你们受荣耀。我想说，我们这必死的身体还要换上不朽坏的身体，这必死的总要变成不朽坏的。从现在起到将来荣耀显现的时候，我们所受的苦难是微不足道的。受造之物切望等候神儿女显出来。

因为受造之物服在虚空之下，不是自己愿意，乃是因那叫他如此的。但受造之物仍然指望脱离败坏的辖制，得享神儿女自由的荣耀。我们知道，这万物到如今还是同有叹息劳苦的指望，等候得着儿子的自由。不但如此，就是我们这有圣灵初熟果子的人，也是自己心里叹息，等候得着我们身体上救赎。

我们得救是在乎盼望；但希望看到的事不算希望。人岂盼望看见所见的事呢？同样，圣灵也帮我们在软弱中代求。因为不知道当怎样祷告，只是圣灵亲自用说不出来的叹息替我们祷告。

那鉴察人心的知道圣灵的心意，是照神的旨意替圣徒祈求。这是主的道。我们已经做了关于圣灵的一系列讲道，今晚是这个系列的最后一讲。在这段时间里，我们一起探讨了圣灵在我们身上和为我们所做的一些非常熟悉的事情。

他呼召我们，并使我们能够相信；他重生我们，在我们心中创造基督般的品格；他使我们在教会中彼此联合。他赋予我们恩赐，使我们能够以改变生命的方式服侍周围的人。这些都是大家熟知的，但今晚我们要看一段经文，它告诉我们圣灵为我们所做的是最终、最伟大的事情之一，这可能是最令人惊讶的事情之一，并且并不是那么广为人知。让我们从这段经文中注意到，这里告诉我们圣灵将来会为我们做什么；因此，现在我们可以让圣灵为我们做什么；我们如何在自己的生命中让圣灵这样做。

将来圣灵要为我们做什么，在现在我们又可以怎样让圣灵来做这些事呢？我们在谈论什么呢？首先，将来圣灵要为我们做什么。简而言之，《罗马书》第八章是一个非常精彩的章节，再往下一点，在第8章30节，我们可以读到：“那些预先所定下的人，祂也预先所知道的；又那些预先所知道的，也预先拣选了；又那些预先拣选了的，也预备用义。

”（和合本）他不仅止于称义，还要使我们荣耀。我们将要被荣耀。保罗在阅读中常常改变救赎时态，有时说“已经得救”、“已经被赎回”，有时说“将会得救”、“将会被赎回”。实际上，在这里他也这样做了，你注意到了吗？

因为在14、15和16节中，他说：“你们既然是基督的信徒，就都是他的儿女。我们已经被收养了；我们也领受了儿子的心志。”然而，看第23节，它说：“我们正期待着被收养。”他再次这样做了。

这段话的问题出在哪里？答案在于这个概念的丰富性。你看，赎罪这个词，特别是这里起作用的那个词，意味着被赎回、被买回，从奴役中解救出来，从奴隶身份中解放出来。“奴役”不仅仅是指身陷枷锁，不自由，而是指不能成为自己应有的样子，不能去做本该做的事情。

我们从圣经中知道，在创世记第三章，当人类犯罪失去与神的关系时，也失去了所有其他的关系。当我们失去与神的关系后，一切关系都变得破裂。除了神最初设计的样子外，没有一样东西是正常的，因此我们在生活的各个方面都处于奴役之中，无法自由地成为神希望我们成为的人。换句话说，我们在心理上、社会上、人际关系上和身体上都受到束缚。

我具体指的是什么？即使是最好的基督徒，甚至是那些最成熟的基督徒，仍然会经历极大的恐惧、焦虑和心硬的束缚。他们当然也体验到一定的自由，但仍然有这种感受。即使是最优秀的教会也会经历大量的冲突、自我中心的行为、争斗和偏见。

甚至是最优秀的人也会生病、变老并最终死亡。所有这些都不是神最初设计的样子。所有的痛苦、所有的破碎都不是神希望我们成为的样子。因此，你一成为基督徒，你的罪就被赦免了。

对于在基督耶稣里的人来说，没有定罪。神在基督里看待你，**这意味着祂会像你做了基督所做的一切一样对待你。**从那一刻起，你在祂的眼中绝对被公义地看待，并且在未来的一亿年里也会同样被爱。在这个意义上，在这种深刻的层面上，你是得救的，过去时态已经结束。

然而，尽管你已经被赎回了，你仍然需要进一步的赎罪。他们仍然是被束缚的。我们已经被赎回，但还需要继续被赎回，并且终将得赎。因为罗马书8章17节告诉我们，虽然我们在患难中，在束缚之下，但我们最终会被荣耀，**这意味着所有罪的影响和束缚都将过去，特别是第23节说我们会得到身体上的得赎。**

我们殷切地期盼着那最终的得赎、收养和救恩，即我们身体的得赎。古希腊哲学家认为身体是邪恶的，终极的救赎是灵魂脱离肉体。他们认为身体是坏的、脆弱的、无力的，终极的救赎就是摆脱身体。随着年龄的增长，我越来越认同这种观点。

如果你长期患病或只是变老，会越来越感受到身体的虚弱，你可能会说：“这身体是我的敌人，它是我被囚禁的地方。” 脱离肉体束缚似乎是救赎的一部分，但这不是圣经的观点。你们明白这句话的意思吗？你们最终的得赎并不是去天堂。

你们最终的得赎是在时间终结时复活，拥有一个新而荣耀的身体。这才是终极的喜乐和祝福。这是上帝希望你们作为人类所拥有的全部。这是圣灵的工作。

是圣灵在做这件事。罗马书8章11节说：“如果那使基督从死里复活者的灵住在你们里面，那使基督从死里复活的也必藉着住在你们里面的圣灵给你们的生命。” “住在你里面的是什么？”当你第一次信主时进入你的灵，有一天会改变你的身体。

腓立比书3章21节说：“我们这必死的身体若因基督之灵得生，那必死的身体也必因他的荣耀变化。” 你说，那会是什么样子呢？其实我们对它有一些了解。不仅有耶稣基督以及祂复活后的样子，而且祂是第一个从死里复活的人，**这意味着我们对拥有荣耀复活之身体、不受瑕疵束缚、不被腐败捆绑、没有任何缺陷的意义有所了解。**

此外，在《哥林多前书》15章中，保罗也说了许多伟大的事情：这必死的身体将来要穿上不朽坏的。这必死的身体现在是羞辱的，将来要荣耀地复活；现在是软弱的，将来要得着能力；现在是自然的身体，将来是灵性的身体。看看这是什么意思？这就是你们未来复活荣耀的样子。

你想知道它会是什么样子吗？你知道它会是怎么样的吗？你可能想得太多，因为可能会推测自己能做些什么或者不能做些什么。但我们的问题是，我们实际上对此思考得太少了。

这里有三点我们知道关于你未来复活之身体的事情。它是你的身体，是一个美丽的身体，是一个强大的身体。记住保罗的话：“这必死的身体将来要穿上不朽坏的。”当耶稣从死里复活后显现给门徒时，祂的手掌和脚上的钉痕还在，你还记得吗？

那是因为祂的身体，祂的必死之身穿上了不朽坏。耶稣还是原来的祂，这也是为什么那些在耶稣复活后见到祂的人起初认不出祂。然后他们才认出祂来。你知道对于你们中可能处于20多岁的人来说，最烦人的事之一就是经常遇到40多岁、50多岁的长辈，他们小时候见过你，但自从你长大后就没再见过。

这让你有点不舒服，因为你走上前去说：“嗨，您认识我吗？”对方回答：“不认识。”然后你说：“我是某某某。”接着他们看着你，因为他们最后一次见到你还只是8岁，现在你25岁了。

他们说你是小吉米或小莎莉，那真是糟糕透了。但关键在于，你依然是你自己，只是经过成长过程的转变，变成了8岁时候的那个你。他们能看得出来，你的身体、你的脸庞、你的眼睛，哦，看看你！这就是它会是什么样子。

我们会是**真正的自己，我们真的是**我们自己。这真是太神奇了，在世界上没有任何其他宗教能够像这样强调自我。我们会是**真正的自己，我们的身体将穿上不朽的外衣。在这个世界里，我们有这种想法，但在那个世界里，当我们彼此相见时，我们会说：“就是**你啊！

我一直知道你会变成这样。”我曾瞥见过你的样子，但现在看看你，那就是你，那也是我们。所以这将是我们的身体，其次，它将是一个美丽的身体，保罗说那是蒙羞的，但最终会是荣耀的。在这个世界里，有些人有丑陋的灵魂却拥有一副美丽的外表，而有些人则相反，但在那个世界里不会这样。

C.S.刘易斯曾说过（如果他愿意的话），他会把我们中最软弱、最肮脏的人变成一个闪耀着光芒、充满活力与喜悦、智慧和爱的不朽生物，其能量和快乐远远超出我们现在所能想象。他会让我们成为明亮而无瑕的镜子，完美地反射出上帝的伟大、欢乐和仁慈。这正是我们在等待的，绝不会是别的——一面完美的镜子，但还有另一种方式可以做到这一点。刘易斯的朋友J.R. 托尔金在某处提到，他虚构作品中的一个角色去世后被安放在灵堂上。

这是他对这一场景的描述：“在他身上展现出了巨大的美丽，所有前来瞻仰的人都为之惊叹，因为他们看到他的青春之美的恩典、成年时期的勇敢、老年时的智慧与威严都融为一体。他在那里躺卧，直到世界崩塌之前，都是人类国王荣耀的形象。” 所以托尔金想要表达的是：比如，孩子们有一种美，他们失去了这种美；年轻人和中年人在他们的巅峰时期拥有另一种美，这种美是孩子所没有的，老年人也没有；但老年人又拥有一种威严、智慧和高贵。当然，这些美丽与荣耀虽然分散存在，但在未来它们将被统一起来。

保罗说我们会变得不同，但我们仍然是自己，而且他说星星之间是有区别的，每颗星星都有自己的光芒。每一颗星星都是不同的，每一个都与众不同。但它们都会是星星，并且不仅仅是我们的身体会变得不同，而会是美丽而又强大的身体。保罗说：“它被缝合在软弱之中。

” 也就是说，我们的身体现在处于软弱的状态，但在未来会被提升为力量之体。然后他又进一步说，这不仅仅是一个自然的身体，而是灵性的身体。那么，什么是灵性身体呢？实际上想想这个说法，这不是一个合理的分类吗？

灵性身体，这个词并不通顺。看看我们现有的分类，要么是精神，要么是肉体。好吧，保罗，我们会成为精神还是肉体？保罗说：“是的。

” 事实上，耶稣会通过门进来，他会通过紧闭的门进来。记得路加福音24章吗？复活的基督从紧闭的门中进来，人们说他是个鬼魂。他说：“给我条鱼吃。

”然后他就吃了鱼。他说：“我不是风也不是灵，而是有血有肉的。”你们摸我、看我，是灵的身体。不要害怕，要勇敢地走，不要气馁。

你现在有五种感官，如果有一天你有了上千种感官呢？谁知道呢？让我们现在就揭开这个面纱吧，因为我不知道我们能不能做到。但我们知道得更多。

但是你有没有想过你的未来——复活的、完美的身体和荣耀细胞呢？当然可以多想一些，但我想大多数人并不是因为过于纠结这点而生气。因为你没有减掉体重，看起来永远达不到理想中的身材或体格或荣耀，这正是因为你在想太多。**我们需要好好管理我们的身体，尽可能地做好管理者，但这不是我们寄托希望的地方。**

你想要的力量、荣耀，你知道，在这一刻之前，有一个你将永远不会出现，直到圣灵赋予你的肉身生命，直到我们在等候的赎恩时刻到来时，你会吃下对身体赎回的渴望。但不仅如此，不仅如此。当圣灵完成它的工作后，我们将生活在一个更新的世界中。请看第19节，只是一分钟的时间，只是为了指出，随着我们身体的复活，还有第19、20和21节的内容，这真是令人惊讶。

明天是感恩节，我们想让你知道今年有一个特别的机会。你可能已经知道了，《福音与生命》支持“复兴城市”事工，这是一个致力于通过教会植堂在世界各地推动福音运动的使命。城到城是由提姆·凯勒共同创立的，他非常关心这个使命。明年，在2026年肯尼亚的一次培训活动中，“城到城”将帮助训练、指导和支持两组共二十位牧者在全球各地植堂教会。

这个感恩节，我们的目标是筹集150,000美元来资助正在参加在肯尼亚内罗毕培训的教会植堂者，以便城市到城市的使命能够支持这些植堂者在非洲各地建立教会。这项工作对于福音在非洲各大城市中的传播至关重要，从坎帕拉到拉各斯再到约翰内斯堡。因此，在你们考虑如何在感恩节捐款时，请考虑为福音生活作出捐赠。我们收到的每一美元都将直接用于帮助城市到城市在2026年支持非洲建立新教会的工作。

明天要捐款的话，请访问gospelonlife.com/Tuesday。再次，gospelonlife.com/Tuesday。感谢你们对这个事工慷慨而忠心的支持。现在，让我们听听凯勒博士接下来的信息。

1921年，它说了什么？它说创造物，也就是自然世界——山川、动物和树木。它说创造物在期待着神儿女的显现。因为创造物被置于顺服之下不是出于自己的选择，而是出于那将它置于顺服之下的那位的意愿，在希望中，创造物本身将会从衰败的束缚中得释放，并进入神儿女的荣耀自由之中。

什么？什么？它说了三件事。实际上，我们对这三件事知之甚少，但我们知道这三件事。

它说自然世界不是它应该的样子，因为我们。我们的罪使自然世界变得有缺陷，所以甚至自然世界也不是它应该的样子。它是受挫的。它没有达到神所期望的状态。

它处于衰败的束缚中。这是第一件事情。第二，它知道自己不是它应该的样子，并且渴望得到释放。保罗在这里的意思是什么？

树木和动物怎么能知道这些？当然，我希望你知道，他并不是在做童话般的事情。他不是在说，树木和动物能说话，但当你在场时它们就不说了。他并不是这个意思，但他要说的是：创造物有自己的生命。

上帝也造了它们来荣耀他自己，就像你们一样。从创世记19章可以看出，这自然界也在荣耀上帝，因此，树木、动物都是与我们并列的生灵，它们有自己的生命，并且值得我们极大的尊重。但这里有一个原因。某种意义上，创造物以它自己的方式比你我更了解它的创造者。

几年前，这就是它在说的意思。几年前，记得我在戈登康韦尔神学院有一位老师叫伊丽莎白·埃利。有人曾说过，如果你理解了这些事情，你会对一个非常谦卑的生灵感到敬畏。你知道为什么吗？

因为牡蛎比你更好地履行了上帝赋予它们成为牡蛎的角色，而你却未能很好地成为上帝希望你成为的人。你们与应该成为的样子相差甚远。你们做得不够好。你成了上帝想要的那个男人或女人了吗？

但不，牡蛎更接近这个目标。它们比你更荣耀上帝。在某种意义上，创造物知道有什么不对，并渴望复活，而人类却没有这种渴望。但你看最后那一句怎么说？

创造物将从它的束缚和衰败中被释放出来，如何实现这一点呢？它将进入我们的自由之中。**这意味着什么？圣灵将降临在我们身上，赐给我们最终的赎罪、最终的荣耀，使我们和我们的身体得到完全的救赎。**

这将是一场如此充满爱、力量和荣耀的爆炸，以至于整个自然界都会随之而来。自然将会成为它应有的样子。这不是令人惊叹吗？让我再给你简单推理一下。

他说，在出埃及记19章中，上帝对他的子民说：“你们是我的珍宝，虽然全地都是我的。” 你是我的珍宝，整个地球都是我的。他所说的正是这个意思：我爱地球，我爱星星和月亮，我爱山川、树木和动物，我爱大自然，但我更爱你。你是最珍贵的宝藏，你知道这意味着什么吗？

实际上，大自然也参与了我们的故事。这让我感到不可思议的是，当你走出门去欣赏自然之美时，当你看到山脉的壮丽和海洋的美丽时，你会想到这一切只是未来荣耀景象的一个影子。现在的自然只是其辉煌未来的预兆，对吧？然而，你们将比未来的、更新后的自然更加辉煌。

圣灵将会做到这一点。因为圣灵的任务就是消除痛苦、解除束缚、修复破碎、终结呻吟。将来它会这样做，所以你可能会想：这意味着什么？我们只能等待吗？

我们现在正在经历痛苦和挣扎。注意到了吗？我们在痛苦中呻吟，大自然也在呻吟。顺便说一句，“呻吟”这个词在这里出现了三到四次，意味着疼痛。

人们在临终时呻吟，在分娩时呻吟，在遭受剧烈痛苦时也呻吟。我们现在生活在一个充满痛苦的时代，我们呻吟，自然也在呻吟。所以你说，最终所有的呻吟都会结束，所有的痛苦都将消失，这是圣灵的工作，真是太好了，但目前我们不能独自面对。顺便说一句，我们正在讨论的是第二点，那些关心的人请注意。

圣灵的任务就是处理痛苦和呻吟，修复我们生命中的破碎。这就是我们要被告知的，最终他会完全解决这些问题，但他现在并没有让我们独自面对，不，他已经进入我们的生活帮助我们应对这些痛苦。我们在内心深处呻吟，处境艰难。你知道吗？

记得那位伟大诗人的那句话：“事物分崩离析，中心无法维持。”“无政府主义已横行于世。” 确实如此。一切都分崩离析了。

你的身体在分崩离析。你的关系在分崩离析。你的家庭在分崩离析。你的社群也在分崩离析。

一切都分崩离析了。机构、运动，一切都会分崩离析。祂说，你是什么意思？它们会死亡。

人们会搬家。人们会争斗。这个世界的一切都充满着熵增。我们哀叹。

事物总是不断分崩离析，但圣灵已经进入我们的生活，作为未来荣耀的首果。看，第23节，不仅如此，而且我们自己拥有圣灵的首果。这个“首果”这个词至关重要。“首果”的意思是指收割的第一天所收集的庄稼，即使他们还要再花两周时间才能收完所有的麦子或谷物。

但第一天，你们可以先摘一些来吃，这是一种未来盛宴的预尝，是未来财富的一种定金。它是一份未来的真正部分。我们被告知的是，在圣灵中，这位奇妙的人和力量，将来会完全处理我们的哀叹与痛苦，现在已经在我们的生活中了。我们得以品尝那份荣耀，这使我们能够应对生活中的哀叹与痛苦。

这就是这段经文告诉我们的。我将用航行和划船的两个比喻来说明这一点。你知道，在航行中，因为有风在你的背后推动着你，所以你可以前进。而在划船时，可能没有风，甚至风迎面吹来，但通过努力，你仍然可以回家。

因此，在哀叹与痛苦之中，圣灵以两种方式帮助我们，祂确实如此。首先是在第15、16、17节中提到的： “圣灵与我们的灵同证我们是神的儿女。”它使我们知道我们是祂的孩子。事实上，经文说，“圣灵用我们的灵为我们作见证，我们因着祂叹息，呼喊阿爸父。

” **阿巴是亚拉姆语中对爸爸或爸爸的称呼。**这意味着圣灵赐予我们如此的信心，知道神爱我们，让我们能够依靠祂并像小孩子向父亲求助一样向祂伸出援手。**这就是我说的航行。** 有时候，尽管周围有很多麻烦，神仍然通过圣灵——圣灵就是儿子的灵——赐给我们这种喜乐和祂存在的感觉。

我们会喊出“阿巴”，这是确认我们是祂的孩子，但这并不是总是如此。有时圣灵在更艰难的时候帮助我们。有时候唯一回家的方式不是航行，因为一切都不起作用。圣灵所做的其中一件事是通过圣灵的果子改变你。

祂照亮你，帮助你理解神；祂赋予你使用恩赐的能力，但有时一切都似乎不对劲。你看不见任何人改变你的生活。神对你来说并不真实，祷告变得枯燥无味，你的祷告也没有得到回应。然而，圣灵并没有抛弃你。

看第26节和27节：“同样，圣灵也帮助我们，因为我们不知道该为什麼祈求；但圣灵亲自用言语无法表达的叹息为我们代求。” 有时候我们甚至不知道该为什麼祈祷。这就是我们在最深处的时候。我们甚至不知道该为什麼祈祷。

我们被麻烦压得喘不过气来，我们哀叹得如此深重和强烈。然而，在那些时候，圣灵与我们同在。多年来，当我思考这一点时，我想说，有时候圣灵并没有赐给我们无尽的喜乐。有时圣灵只赐给我们超乎理解的平安，让我们继续划桨，继续做下一件事，即使我们现在感觉不到祂也在我们身边。

你知道有多少诗篇吗？有150首诗篇，但我要告诉你，很多，甚至一半的诗篇，诗人一开始都在挣扎，不开心、生气，发生了什麼事？我无法理解。事情糟透了。

哦，主啊，为什么你要让这一切发生？但他在最后说，即使是在最艰难的时候，他也在挣扎，他说：“但我确信，我将看见主的恩惠和活人的国土。” 我想，他的内心就是如此坚定，尽管一切似乎都在告诉他没有神，或者神不关心他，甚至在他心里问自己是否还需要神。但他仍然说：“不，不，不，我知道，我知道，他知道我在，他不会让我这样下去，我要做下一件事，我要祈祷，即使现在读圣经也感觉不到什么，但因为圣灵在帮助我。

圣灵在乎你的痛苦和呻吟，这是他的职责。” 有一天这一切都会结束，但现在也在帮助你。我们还没有结束，这里有一个原因。如果你是纽约人，你们很实际，纽约人会说，这都很鼓舞人心，但具体怎么做呢？

你怎么做？你说的未来是多么美好，但它应该怎样帮助我现在的困境呢？我看不出来。你知道吗？

关键在于坚定的信心。诗篇37:24, 25中说：“我们在指望他的时候就得救了；人若等候他，就不羞愧。”这就是你需要的东西——耐心、镇定和坚持。如何做到这一点？

就是通过信心。你知道信心有多重要吗？信心是确定的未来。想象两个女人，她们都有一个包，里面装着她们在这个世界上所有的资产和金钱。

她们都有一千美元现金，这就是她们拥有的全部。不同的是，其中一个女人知道明天会收到一笔一百万美元的资金汇入她的银行账户；而另一个女人则知道在未来的一段时间内没有任何人会给她任何帮助。想象这两个女人在纽约市外出，她们都遭遇了同样的事情：有人抢走了她们的包。她们会怎么应对呢？

我可以告诉你，知道明天银行账户里会有1亿美元进账的女人可能会说：“真不方便啊，算了。” 而另一个女人则陷入了绝望之中。为什么会有这么大的不同反应呢？同样是这种情形，为什么会这样？

因为你知道未来的情况完全决定了你如何处理现在的事情。你对自己未来的了解完全决定了你现在应该如何应对。你怎么知道你的身体得赎是即将到来的未来呢？你怎么知道这就是你的未来？

如果你确定了这一点，那么你能面对任何事情，因为比1亿美元更好的东西正要进入你的银行账户。你怎么能确定这一点呢？这里有一个方法可以让你确定：多年来，许多评论家都在思考一个问题——圣灵怎么能哀叹呢？在第26节中提到，当圣灵与我们同在，并且当我们经历所有困难时，经文说圣灵为我们哀叹，**这意味着圣灵正在受苦。**

许多评论家都疑惑，神的灵怎么会是有限的人类而受苦呢？耶稣在马可福音第七章中带了一个聋哑人，这个人一生都在遭受痛苦。他想要治愈这个男人。在他即将治愈的时候，他抬头望天，发出哀叹——同一个词。

**这意味着他在痛苦。**为什么？为什么他不直接说：“哈哈，你看我要做什么？” 为什么不呢？

为什么他会哀叹？第一个答案是：因为他如此充满爱和脆弱的爱，以至于能够情感上与一个刚认识的受苦者产生共鸣，并且他自己也感同身受这个人的痛苦。但最终的原因是他知道，为了使我们从痛苦中解脱出来，耶稣自己必须经历痛苦和哀叹。没有人曾经像耶稣那样被差遣。

你知道，当耶稣在十字架上说：“我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？”祂是在引用诗篇22章1节的话。诗篇22章1节的内容是这样的：我的神，我的神，你为何远离我？为何不拯救我？

为何从我的哀哭中如此远呢？耶稣在痛苦中哀号，被遗弃了。我也在哀号时被祂遗弃了。为什么？

因为祂承受了我们罪应得的遗弃，好让你知道：无论何时你哀号，神都不会离弃你，祂与你同在。因此，在面对生命中的哀号和苦难时，你需要有未来的确定性；而在拥有未来确定性的前提下，你需要知道耶稣基督为你而死，并为你经历了这一切。即使你失败了，没有活出应有的生活，你的信仰不完美，甚至你的悔改也需要再悔改，神依然与你同在，圣灵也与你同在。祂不会离弃你。

这意义非凡，不是吗？如果神如此爱这个世界——包括物质世界，我们是否应该关心创造和环境？是的。如果只有圣经说这个物质世界是永恒的，这难道不是一个对抗疾病和饥饿的强大激励吗？

如果你正面临死亡，还有什么比这更好的呢？你可以笑着面对死亡。如果你中的任何一位都患有慢性病，或者只是变老了，甚至感觉自己身体成了敌人，那都不是真的。我希望你们听到这一点。

不是你的身体里的罪恶和邪恶是敌人，而是你灵魂里的罪恶和邪恶以及这个世界上的罪恶。如果我们没有希望，除非祂赐给我们胜利，哦神，祂必须赐给我们胜利，并且祂会赐给我们的。让我们祷告。我们亲爱的天父，请帮助我们理解这段经文的神学意义。

这应当激励我们关心物质需求；在面对自己的疾病甚至即将到来的死亡时，这应当使我们充满力量。它应该让我们充满如此的盼望，以至于我们能够面对最深的呻吟和痛苦。我们知道有一天你的灵会终结这一切。父亲，我们像受造物一样渴望身体最终得赎，在此之前，圣灵啊，请帮助我们，帮助我们在所面对的一切中拥有过往理解中的喜乐与平安。

感谢你给予我们的这些保证。让我们成为充满热情和喜乐的人，同时也懂得为那些哭泣的人哭泣，因为我们知道这些伟大的真理。我们奉耶稣的名祷告，阿门。感谢你们加入我们的《福音与生命播客》。
