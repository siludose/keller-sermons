# 工作与安息 / Work and Rest

**讲员**: 提摩太·凯勒 (Tim Keller)

---

Welcome to Gospel and Life. Are you struggling to find meaning and purpose in your work? We spend much of our lives at our jobs, but our work can often be the area where we feel the most frustration and futility in our lives.

Today on the podcast, Tim Keller helps us understand how the Gospel frees us to have hope and joy in our vocations. Now the scripture this morning is from Luke's Gospel chapter 6 verses 1 through 11. One Sabbath, Jesus was going through the grain fields and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain, rub them in their hands and ate the kernels.

Some of the Pharisees asked, why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath? Jesus answered them, have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? He entered the house of God and taking the consecrated bread, he ate what is lawful only for priests to eat, and he also gave some to his companions.

Then Jesus said to them, the son of man is Lord of the Sabbath. On another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching and a man was there whose right hand was shriveled. The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath.

But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled hand, get up and stand in front of everyone. So he got up and stood there. Then Jesus said to them, I ask you which is lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil to save life or to destroy it.

He looked around at them all and then said to the man, stretch out your hand. He did so and his hand was completely restored, but they were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus. This is God's word.

We're looking at the book of Luke and the life of Jesus in the book of Luke. For a number of weeks we've been looking at Jesus' teaching about what it means to follow him, what it means to be is disciple and of course Jesus is essentially taking the gospel, who he is, what he did. And he's saying his disciples are people who apply the gospel to absolutely every single area of life.

And today we come to an area that is referred to. It's covered in the fourth commandment of the Ten Commandments. It's in Exodus 20.

Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord, your God. On it you shall not do any work for on the seventh day the Lord rested. Sabbath rests.

Now I know that that we all have somewhat different relationships to work. There are people here for example who are out of work and would love to have more work. There are people here who in general have said to me that they have a problem with work with discipline, but by and large in New York City, in the middle of New York City, the biggest problem we have, one of the biggest problems we have is Sabbath rest, the discipline of the getting of Sabbath rest.

Why do we need it? Where do we get it? How do we do it?

Why do we need it? Where do we get it? How do we do it?

It's all here. First of all, why do we need it? Look at verse 1-2.

Jesus and His disciples were going through a field on a Sabbath day, and they picked some heads of grain, rubbed them in their hands to eat the kernels, and they were condemned. They were accused of breaking the Sabbath by the Pharisees, and that's because reaping grain was one of the 39 forms of work that was forbidden on the Sabbath day by the halaka at the time, which is the religious regulations. As soon as you hear that, this was breaking the Sabbath to just take the heads off of grain and rub them in your hands and get the kernels out and eat them.

Right away we say, oh, we say how legalistic, how moralistic, all those rules, how awful. We turn up our nose at it, but notice Jesus' response is not the Son of Man has come to do away with the Sabbath, or to get us beyond all this. That's not what he says.

He says the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath, and we'll get to that in a second, but it means at least this, that I'm all about the Sabbath. The Sabbath is what I'm all about, which means here's what we learn to start with. The most workaholic culture in the history of the world, it's us, dare not, turn up its nose at any effort, even misguided efforts, to give to people one of the things most crucial to making life even human, which is rest.

Judas Schulovitz, who is a writer for the New York Times magazine, probably in New York Times book review, she wrote an article in New York Times magazine just this last month in the first week of March called Bring Back the Sabbath, and she says this. First of all, she gives a little bit of background on herself. She says she was raised probably in New York, I'm not sure, but she was raised in a religious community at a synagogue, but like the average professional secular New Yorker, she resisted and basically moved away from her religious upbringing, and then she began to experience a phenomenon.

Here's how she describes it. She says my mood would darken every weekend. Until by Saturday afternoon, I'd be unresponsive and morose.

My normal routine, which involved brunch with friends, made me feel impossibly restless. Then I began to do something that, as a teenager, profoundly put off by her religious education, I could never have imagined ever wanting to do. I began dropping in on a nearby synagogue.

Finally, I developed a theory for my condition. If formerly people suffered from the Sabbath, which means all the regulations, I now was suffering from the lack thereof. There is ample evidence that our relationship to work is out of whack.

Let me argue on behalf of an institution that has kept work of holism and reasonable check for thousands of years. Most people mistakenly believe that all you have to do to stop working is to not work. But the inventors of the Sabbath understood that it was a much more complicated undertaking.

You cannot downshift casually and easily. This is why the Puritan and Jewish Sabbaths were so exactly intentional. The rules did not exist to torture the faithful.

Interrupting the ceaseless round of striving requires a surprisingly strenuous act of the will. One that has to be bolstered by habit, as well as by social sanction. And what she's saying is simply this.

In spite of the fact she knows about, she recognizes the potential for abuse. Our relationship to work as a society is so seriously out of whack. That anyone who thinks that you're going to be able to get rested by simply knocking off whenever you feel tired is hopelessly naive.

The ability to rest, deeply rest, is a life or death thing. No one can do without it. But it is not natural.

It is not simple. It is absolutely difficult. And it takes an enormous amount of discipline and practice.

That's what she's saying. Now why would that be? Why would it be so hard?

Well, first of all, we have to look at our modern situation. I'll do that briefly. The modern situation means that the eternal human need for rest is enormously aggravated.

Let me give you four trends. A, B, C, D, trends. Trend 1, A, excuse me, an A trend, is the fact that more and more, at least in Western culture, jobs are insecure.

The idea of jobs, hold departments. If they don't perform, if they don't turn profit, they're eliminated. Job security has never been a culture.

Never been a place where job security was so bad. I don't think. Number two, these are the same big things and kind of in nut shells here.

There's been a lot of research done on the fact that where it used to be, the people making the money at the top of a company, you used to make maybe 10 or 20 times with people at the bottom of the company made. Now it's more like 100 to 200 times. And partly as a result of this, to some degree, increasingly, people who make large amounts of money are expected to put in enormous numbers of hours.

It's just expected. And if you don't want to do it, there's a line behind you. Whereas people on the bottom are having to take multiple jobs.

So everybody's overworked as a matter where you are on the scale. In order to make ends meet, they have to take multiple jobs. That's B, C, technology, A technology.

You can work anywhere. Which means, now, we work everywhere. It means that you can't stop work from spilling out into every nook and crane of your life.

And that's C and D. The fourth trend, and this is a little more complex. Cultural analysts have said, and there's pretty much universal agreement on this, that whereas traditional societies said, you got your meaning in life through your family.

You got your meaning in life through family. And through basically fulfilling a fairly prescribed social role, either as a mother or father or brother or sister, husband or wife or son or daughter. And work wasn't as important in a situation like that.

You just need to find a way to make a living because family was what everything was about. But we are the first culture in history that says, you define yourself by deciding what you want to be and attaining it. And then you have significance, which means that work, there's never been more psychological and social and emotional pressure on work to be either fulfilling or at least lucrative.

There's never been a culture like that, which means A, B, C, D, A, B and C, you know, mean that we are more desperately in need of rest than we ever have less time for rest than ever. And D means we emotionally on the inside have less ability to rest and relax than we anyone ever has had, any cultures ever had. But as bad as that is, as aggravating as the modern situation is, the Sabbath is an ancient practice because there is an abiding human problem that has always been there.

The Sabbath is obviously not a response to modern hecticness. There's something that's already been there and what is that thing that's already been down there? There's something else that needs to be addressed by Sabbath.

And Judith Schulovitz, and this is just a terrific article. She understands what that deeper thing is when she says, quote, when the Sabbath was still sacred, not only did drudgery give way to festivity and family gatherings and occasional worship, but the machinery of self-censorship shut down too, stilling the eternal inner murmur of self-reproach. The eternal inner murmur of self-reproach.

The inner machinery, now what is she talking about there? Sleep experts know that in order to be restored, you don't just need amount of sleep, but depth of sleep, what they call REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. And of course, they say, I think that only happens after certain period of time.

In other words, if you would take eight, one hour naps or something like that, and you say, I slept for eight hours, the next day, you would be absolutely just fatigued because you have to, I think sleep a certain period of time before, you go into deep sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. And so it's not just so much amount of sleep, it's the depth of sleep that you need, and hear what she's saying, and what I'm saying is, there is, on the one hand, your external work, and you do need rest from physical exertion, but there is a deeper problem. There is a work underneath the work.

There is an eternal inner murmur. There is an inner machinery of self-censorship. What does she mean by that?

It's not guilt. It's the need to prove yourself to yourself, to others, and that work makes the other kinds of work incredibly weary. That's what brings the wearyness.

And that work, which is very, very difficult, you're always trying to prove yourself, you're trying to make sure that you, you know, that work, it's never enough. You're never, it's never enough. And because of that, you see, that's rapid eye movement, deep rest of the soul that you've got to have, or else all the vacations, number one, help.

If you take your vacations, you knock off, but you're not able to deal with that, you're not able to get that deeper rest, able to get that spiritual rest, you're going to be in fatigue all the time. So under the big rest, under the physical rest, as a need for deep spiritual rest. For example, you know, the only good rocky movie, the first one, the question comes to rocky, you know, why are you driven?

Why are you doing all this performance? You know, why are you, you know, why are those trumpets blazing as you run through the streets of Little Italy and Philadelphia and go up the art museum steps? Why are you working so hard?

And his answer was, I want to go the distance, then I'll know I'm not a bum. So our hero is being driven by the eternal inner murmur of self-reproach. The inner machinery.

That's why he's working so hard. That's why he makes it to the top, et cetera. That's why he's going to burn out.

That's why the other movies are going to be terrible. There is a deep need for a deep soul rest, without which physical rest is not going to help you. So we need Sabbath rest.

We've never needed it more than we do now, but we need it. So that's why we need it. Number one, number two, where do we get it?

Now let's look at what Jesus says. They say he's violating the Sabbath and how does he respond? Well, he says, have you ever read that what David did when he and his companions were hungry?

He entered the house of God and taken the consecrated bread. He ate what is lawful for only priest to eat, and then he gave some to his companions. Now what's interesting here is Jesus takes an incident from 1 Samuel 21, where we're told that David, when he was on run for his life, he was running for his life.

He went through the tabernacle, and in the tabernacle, there is the place where the show bread, which was the bread of the presence. It was in the holy place. In the tabernacle was part of the Sabbath worship, and you are not allowed to eat it.

It was part of the worship, and David ate it. Of course, as Jesus implies, he was never condemned for it. God never said it was anything wrong with what he did.

He was never condemned for it at all. Now Jesus is inviting us to think out the implications of that. If the Sabbath and worship regulations can be set aside in a pinch, but on the other hand, if there's absolutely no place anywhere in the Bible, where the moral law can be set aside in a pinch.

There's no place where God says, well, you were in a hurry, so committing adultery is all right, worshiping an idol is all right, stealing, robbing, armed robbery. That was all right. You know you were in trouble.

You were in, no, if there's no place ever where the moral law is set aside in a pinch, but the Sabbath and the ceremonial and the worship regulations are set aside in a pinch. What does this mean? Think of the reasoning.

It means that they are provisional, meaning that means they are temporary, meaning that they will end when something comes along that makes them obsolete to which they point. And what would that be? He says, it's very, very next verse.

Then Jesus says to them, assuming that they are thinking along these lines, I am Lord of the Sabbath, which is astounding. Let's think about what he's saying. He's saying actually, more things than I'm going to be able to open up in this sermon, but he's saying this.

I am the one that the Sabbath regulations all pointed to. I can give you the deep rest of the soul that you most need. I am the Lord of rest.

Jesus, I am the Lord of rest. And you know what this means, two ways. If you want rest, you have to go to him.

And if you think you've gone to him, but you don't have any rest, you still don't know what you have. You still haven't taken hold of what you have. You still haven't understood what you have.

Now, how and why? How is he the Lord of rest and why? All right.

Let me take you to three couple passages, a couple of other verses that are important. What does this mean that he's Lord of rest? What does it mean to give you rest?

First of all, let's go to the original verse in the Bible about this. You go all the way back to Genesis 1, the end of Genesis 1, the beginning of Genesis 2, and God has just finished creating the world. And this is what we read.

And God saw that all he had created, pardon me, and God saw that all he had made, it was good. And God finished the work he had been doing so that on the seventh day, he rested from his work. God rested seventh day, right?

But what do you mean God rested? Was he tired? God can't be tired.

And if God can't be tired, what in the world does it mean he's rested? You and I can define rest as getting over being tired. What does it mean that God rested if he wasn't tired?

And here's the answer. One of the things that's so neat about the creation account is every time God makes something before he moves on to something else, he says something over and over and over again. You know what it is?

He makes something and he looks at it and he says, that's good. That was good. Then he makes something else and he says, that's good.

And then when he gets to the very end, it's the which I just read. He looks at all of it and he says, very good. And that's what it means to rest.

To be utterly satisfied with what's been done. To be utterly satisfied. That's the only way you can walk away.

It's the only way you can stop. The only way you can put your doing down is if you're absolutely satisfied with the doing. That's good.

That is good. Now you can rest. Now you can relax.

So you see, the definition of resting is to be utterly satisfied with what was done. Secondly, second verse. Scroll forward, Hebrews chapter 4 is talking about the gospel.

The Hebrews writer is talking to Christians about what it means to believe in Jesus. And as he's talking about the gospel and believing in Jesus, suddenly he says this, there remains then a rest for the people of God. For anyone who through the gospel enters God's rest, rest from his own work just as God rested from his.

Now this is an amazing statement. What does it mean to become a Christian? I mean, there's a whole lot of ways of putting it.

And the reason you need every different way is because you need them all to understand the richness of it. To become a Christian is someone who's able to look at your work the way God looked at his, able to look at your life the way God looked at his. You're being told here that through Jesus Christ, you can look at your life.

You can look at yourself and say, it's absolutely satisfying. It's absolutely good. There's nothing else that needs to be done.

It is good. All the work that I need to do is finished. It's estimated that most of us spend half of our waking hours at work.

How does the wisdom of the Bible apply to our careers? In other words, how can our work connect with God's work and how can our vocations be more emotional? In his book, Every Good and Devere, Tim Keller draws from decades of teaching on vocation and calling to show you how to find true joy in your work as you serve God and others.

The book offers surprising insights into how a Christian perspective on work can serve as the foundation for a thriving career and a balanced personal life.

That's gospelandlife.com slash give. Now here's Dr. Keller with the remainder of today's teaching.

How could that be? How is that possible? But you see, look, Judas Schulovitz, one more time.

I'm going to go back to her one more time because it's such a great article. She gives us insight and she puts it like this. And this is great.

She says, not even our most pardon me, not even our group leisure activities can do for us what the Sabbath rituals could once be counted on to do. Hear that? She says, not enough for you to just knock off and go on out there and do all your leisure activity.

That's not going to give you the rest from the eternal inner murmur and inner machinery. Oh no. She says, she says, not even our group, group leisure activities can do for us what Sabbath rituals could once be counted to do because religious rituals do not exist simply to promote togetherness.

They are designed to convey to us a story about who we are. The story told by the Sabbath is of creation. God rested and we rest in order to honor the image of the divine in us to remind us that there's more to us than our work.

Now she to a great degree has discerned exactly what the Hebrews writers trying to say. Remember we said there's a work underneath as well as the work up here. There's a physical work but the thing that makes things really worry, really weary is not the physical work because listen, you go back into the book of Genesis, you go back to Paradise, go to the Garden of Eden and there was work there.

In other words, what really is there are problems is not the presence of work, it's the absence of deep rest. So there's the external work but then there's the work down here. What is that?

And she knows what it is. She already talked about it. She called the eternal inner murmur a self approach but here's what it is.

It's trying to know who you are. It's trying to show to other people and to yourself, I know I'm somebody important or something to me, something important. And you do it through the doing.

Every human being does it. Religious people say if I'm really good and if I do many, many good works, God will bless me. Secular people though, their hearts operate on the very same basis, the very same basis.

They don't believe in God or believe in law or the Bible or anything but they have set their standards and their entire self-image rests on meeting those standards and living up to those goals. That's the work, under the work. Always having to prove yourself, always having to assure yourself that you're somebody important.

But that work is never finished. Never finished. It's never over.

It's never enough. You never can look under those circumstances that you're doing and say, it's good. Maybe one day occasionally, but what about tomorrow?

There's always tomorrow. You can never say what God said and see what is rest. To be able to look and say, I am satisfied.

It is good. It is finished. But the Hebrews writer says, through Jesus and only through Jesus, can you get this rest.

Jesus is the one who said, come unto me, O ye who labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon me for I am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls. From my burden is easy.

My yoke is easy and my burden is light. What he's saying is, everybody's serving something. Everybody's trying to get an identity out of something.

But only if you make me the meaning of your life will you get absolute rest. Only through me will you be able to look at yourself, look at your work, look at everything and say it's finished. Everything is necessary that to be done has been done.

It is good. How is that possible? Here's how it's possible.

How's that possible through Jesus? Here's how it's possible. Look at the last verse.

There's a great irony in this verse. You have to put verse 11 together with verse 5. When they were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus.

Now why were they so furious? Do you know what it means when he says, I'm Lord of the Sabbath? I'm the one who invented the Sabbath.

I'm the one who fulfills the Sabbath. He's climbing to be God. There was nothing they could do about that other than to say, we've got to do something about that.

What did they decide they were going to do? They were furious at them. What did they decide they were going to have to do to them eventually?

You know what they had to do? They had to haven't killed, but get this. That made him Lord of the Sabbath.

All they did was make him Lord of the Sabbath. Why? Because on the cross you see him rising.

Do you see him crying? Do you see him calling out? Why is he so restless?

Two verses. Isaiah 57-20. The wicked are like the tossing sea, which cannot rest, whose ways cast up my or in mud.

There is no peace for the wicked. The wicked are like to see, which cannot rest, and 2 Corinthians 5-21. On the cross God made him to be sin, who knew no sin, that we might become the righteousness of God in him.

What's going on with Jesus up there? Why is he doing all that? Why is he crying out?

Why is he writhing? He is experiencing. God is making him experience because God is turning away from him.

Infinite restlessness. There is no rest for those who turn away from God. He was experiencing it.

Infinite restlessness. Cosmic restlessness. Why?

So that when he died, he was able to say what he did. It is finished. What is finished?

Everything necessary for salvation for the most exacting conscience, for the most incredibly perfectionistic, eternal, inner murmur. Do you see that? In other words, Jesus Christ came to live a life you should have lived, perfectly, and died that death you should have died, the penalty, perfectly, so that when God looks at you, because you have received Christ as your Savior, and what does it mean to receive Christ as Savior?

What does it mean to be a Christian? It doesn't mean to say, I'm going to try to be like Jesus, help me. To be a Christian is to say, I rest not on my works, but his.

I rest on his finished work. Accept me because of not my record, his record. Accept me not because of my work, because of his works.

And the minute you say that, God imputes your sin to him. That's what Second Corinthians 5, 21 means, and imputes his righteousness to you, which means that when God looks at you in Christ, he says, it is good. And everything necessary that you've got to do is finished.

And the only set of eyes in the world that you should have to prove yourself to has already said, this is my beloved child in whom I'm well-pleased. Remember, Jerry, it's a fire. Two guys.

And so about the Sabbath, it's the only movie I know in the last 50 years about the Sabbath that I know. And one guy can't stop working. He's a runner, he's a sprinter, and somebody asks him, like they ask Rocky, why are you working so hard to go to the Olympics and win a medal?

And the answer is, I have 10 seconds, he's talking about the dash, you know, 9, 10 seconds the dash. I have 10 seconds to justify my existence. I'm trying to prove myself.

I'm trying to make sure I know who I am, as Judith Schull of it says. That's the work under all the work. And so he's driven, but there's another guy who finds out that the gold medal, I mean, the medal race is going to be held on a Sunday.

And he's a Christian, and he's committed to the practice of Sabbath. But see, the important thing, it's not a legalistic thing at all. He is so secure in who he is in Christ that he is willing to say, I'm not going to run, even if it means costing a gold medal.

The irony is, the first guy gets the gold medal, but it's not enough. It's never enough, because it's never, never enough, because the work underneath the work, the work that really makes you weary, is never finished except in Jesus. In Jesus, God says, it is good.

In Jesus, God looks at you and says it is good. In Jesus, you hear it is finished. You get that, then you can move to the third point.

The third point is, if and only if you get the deep rest that Jesus Christ offers you, can you now turn and ask the question, how do we do this? Now anything you try to do to practice Sabbath, to take time off from work, to stay away from the, anything you do before you understand what I've just gone through is never going to work. Focations don't deal with the deep thing, the deep rest, the REM of the soul.

But once you understand that, let me quickly at least make a list of a few things. What do we learn about how to do it? How to actually practice Sabbath?

And here are a few things, and I got to be fast. Obviously, I can't go into too many details, but the last thing we see with Jesus is, He heals a man on the Sabbath. Now, according to the Halak at the time, you could do medical treatment if the man was dying.

If the person was about to die, it was in dire situation. But you ordinarily couldn't do medical treatment on it like this. You couldn't do this.

So he broke the Sabbath, but notice he does not say, again, he does not say, the reason I'm doing this is because the Sabbath is abrogated. We don't do Sabbath anymore. We don't need to practice the Sabbath.

That's not what he says. He talks as if the Sabbath is still there. He says, I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil?

What he's saying is, I'm doing what I should be doing on the Sabbath, which is restorative. I'm restoring the shriveled. So here's what Jesus is telling us, unfortunately.

We believe, most Christians believe that because of Jesus coming, He fulfills the Sabbath in such a way that we do not have to go through all the regulations of the Old Testament. We don't have to have 3,000 different things we can do and can't do. We can't walk this far.

We can walk this far. So we believe that, but that's a problem because Jesus is saying the practice of Sabbath is still absolutely necessary. And because you don't have the rules, you've got to have anything more danger as Christians who want to practice Sabbath because we don't have the rules.

There are certain disciplines I would suggest very, very strongly that you do. There's three inner disciplines and several outer disciplines so that you can take what you have in Jesus and practice Sabbath so that your relationship to work, and if you're in New York, it probably is would not be any longer seriously out of whack. Interdisciplines.

First of all, if you don't do these three inner disciplines, the outer ones won't work. Number one, interdiscipline. According to the Bible, Sabbath is an act of liberation.

In Deuteronomy Chapter 15, God says, because I read it to you. In Deuteronomy Chapter 15, it says, remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that I brought you out with a mighty hand. Therefore, observe the Sabbath day.

Isn't that interesting? While a God say, you were slaves, but you're free, therefore observe the Sabbath day. And I'll tell you why because obviously, first of all, slaves didn't have a day off.

If you don't rest, you're a slave. Well, think about what this means. If you can't rest, if you can't...

A lot of what I'm talking about here is not just work for income friends. A lot of you can't say no. A lot of you are incredibly over committed.

You're way too busy. You're always too busy. And if you are always too busy and you can't just say no to people and you can't set some time aside, you're a slave.

You're a slave. It's maybe self-imposed. You're a slave to your own needs.

You're a slave to your own insecurities. You're a slave to your own need of self-salvation. You're a slave to your family's hopes.

You're a slave to your culture's expectations. You're a slave to your company. But you're a slave.

You have to say, inside your heart, deep into your own soul, this is an act of liberation. My work does not define me. Christ defines me.

I am not defined by how many customers I get, how much money I make, how well I'm doing this. How expert I become. I am not.

I'm taking time off today. I'm taking time off tonight. I'm taking time off this week.

I'm not going to think about it because I am not a slave. So it's an act of liberation, number one, number two. It's an act of trust.

The Sabbath, our rest points to God's work and rest, which means you're not God. He is. And one of the problems a lot of us have, and unless you tell yourself this is an interdiscipline, you're not going to be able to take the time off you need to.

You need to say it to yourself, I am not the one who keeps the world running. I'm not the one who's bringing money to my family. I'm not the one who's meeting my needs.

I'm not the one. God is the one. I am not God.

Sabbath is not only a discipline of liberation. It's a discipline of trust. I'm not God.

Better stop. I got to move on to the external disciplines, all right? There's five external disciplines.

If you do the internal disciplines, and only if you do them, you'll be able to relax at the external disciplines. If you don't do the internal ones, you're just going to spend the whole day somehow still weary when it's over. But here's the external disciplines.

Number one, take more Sabbath time. Well, somebody says, how do you know how much to take? I'll get to that in a second, but probably more than you're taking, okay?

Take more Sabbath time. Number one, that's easy. Number two, balance your Sabbath time, which means do some avocational, some contemplative, and some inactive stuff.

Avocational means do some things that you ordinarily don't do, okay? Fishing is an avocation if it's not how you make your living, right? You know, a guy who makes his living fishing doesn't want to shouldn't fish on his day off, okay?

But maybe you can. Avocation, and you need some of that, because in avocation, you're enjoying God's finished work, his creation. Number two, contemplative.

Judicial of it was absolutely right when she says, you're not doing the deep work of rest by just doing leisure things. You've got to tell yourself the story of who you are. The reason we can't rest is we're not sure we're okay.

She said that. And therefore, you've got to do worship on your day off. In fact, this is not my day off.

Does everybody know that? This is a 16-hour day for me. When I take my day off on Tuesday or Wednesday, what do I have to start with?

I have to start with worship. I've got to start with worship. If I don't start with worship, I'm not really going to be relaxed the rest of the time.

I've got to tell myself who I am. I've got to tell myself the story of who I am. Avocational, contemplative, and inactive.

Now, what I mean by that is, do you know in the Old Testament, not only people, but the land got a Sabbath year every so often, did you know that? And whenever the land got a Sabbath year, what do they do to it? Do they put different grain in?

No, they'll just let anything come up that would come up. And if you're not rested, unless you have some unstructured time, some unplanned time, some time without family gathering, sometimes without avocation, sometimes where you just can think about whatever thought comes, feel whatever feeling comes. You've got to have some of that.

That's a biblical principle. So balance your use of Sabbath time. So first, take more Sabbath times.

Secondly, balance more Sabbath time. Number three, be accountable for Sabbath time. It is not possible in this world, not to have seasons in which you tend to overwork.

I don't know how you're going to be a doctor ever unless you become a resident, which means you overwork for three years. I don't know how you start a business without sometimes overworking at first, but you need to have accountability. You need to look at somebody in the eye and say, when the two years is up, when the one year is up, when the three years is up, stop me because I do not want to spend the rest of my life in under Sabbath mode.

How many of you know the plates illustration? You're kidding. When I came here, I said to my wife and my children, I'm going to overwork for about three years because we're going to start a church, but then it would be great.

Three and a half years, four years, no change in my schedule. One day, I was coming back into my apartment, and it was a warm day, so the balcony was open, and there was my wife. She had plates, our wedding plates, plates that were given to us when we first got married, and she was out there and she had a hammer.

And as I came in, I heard a smash, and then I looked out there, and there she was, and she put another one down, and she took a hammer and she was smashing the plates. And I went up and I said, what is going on? And she said, she says, you haven't heard me.

You promised that you would at a certain point power down. You're not taking enough time off. You're not taking enough Sabbath.

You're not practicing Sabbath. And you're not hearing me. You're not hearing how incredibly serious this is.

You are not listening to me. And I freaked out, and I was very upset, and I you know, and I wept, and I can't believe you're this upset. And she said, I'm not that upset.

And she said, well, of course you must be that upset. And I was very upset. And it really sunk in, and I really made a change.

But not long afterwards, I said to her, I said, you know, what do you mean you weren't upset? She said, I really wasn't upset. I said, well, you must have been upset.

She says, no. She says, you know, the plates that we've, you know, the saucers that I was breaking, they were all saucers that we didn't have cups for anymore. Be accountable.

Number four, inject Sabbath time into your work. Now, how does that? In other words, in the Old Testament, there was a rule.

There was a law called gleaning, and gleaning meant you could not reap all the way out to the corners of your field. It was a designed limit on productivity so you wouldn't overwork. It will not be enough for you to work like a demon and then take time off.

It means fewer goals. It means, at some point in your life, to really practice what this is saying, to really get the right relationship to work. You probably are going to have to risk falling behind in your career, or you will not be a disciple.

In other words, at some point you're going to say, I'm going to do the things I need to do. Avocationally, contemplatively, I'm going to do my Sabbath. I'm going to do, I'm not going to let this work completely overwhelm me.

And if you do this, you're going to risk falling behind in your career. Maybe God will let you. Maybe He won't.

That's up to Him. Either way, you'll be sane. And even if you fall behind the people who get ahead of you because they're overworking won't be.

So take more Sabbath time, balance your Sabbath time, be accountable for Sabbath time, inject Sabbath time actually into your work and last of all community. Community. I've already hinted at this.

The only way you're going to think these things out is get some other people who are in the same job as you and brainstorm, how can we keep ourselves from being overwhelmed by work? How can we put work in its place? How can you do leisure?

How can you do rest? How can you do it? The only person whose eyes you should have to prove yourself to looks at you now and says it is good.

It is finished. Let that sink deeply into your life. It's going to change your attitude toward work.

Let us pray. Thank you, Father, for giving us what we need to know that we're able to have deep peace, deep poise. There's a calm in our lives that can be here because we know that Jesus Christ has done everything necessary.

He's finished the work. We pray therefore that we could take a look at all the other work that we do and never get rid of our perfectionism, get rid of our overwork, get rid of our underwork because I know Lord many of us underwork because we're afraid of failure, afraid of failure. Many people underwork because they're afraid of failure.

The gospel takes that out too because in Jesus Christ it is finished. We thank you, Father, for this possibility, but we also know we don't realize that by your Holy Spirit help us too. We ask in Jesus' name, amen.

**讲员**: 提摩太·凯勒 (Tim Keller)


欢迎来到《福音与生活》。你是否在工作中难以找到意义和目的？我们大部分时间都在工作，但工作往往是生活中让我们感到最沮丧和无望的领域。今天在播客中，提摩太·基勒（Tim Keller）帮助我们理解福音如何使我们在职业中拥有希望和喜乐。

今天的经文来自路加福音第六章1至11节。有一天安息日，耶稣经过麦田，门徒们开始摘了一些麦穗，搓着吃里面的麦粒。一些法利赛人问：“你们为什么在安息日做不合法的事？”耶稣回答他们说：“难道你们没有读过大卫和他同伴饥饿时所做的事情吗？

当他在神的殿里，取了圣饼来吃，并且给了他的同伴吃。”接着耶稣对他们说：“人子是安息日的主。” 又有一个安息日，耶稣进入会堂教训人。在那里坐着一个右手枯萎的人。

法利赛人和文士在寻找机会控告耶稣，他们密切注视着他，看他是否会医治人，在安息日做不合法的事。但耶稣知道他们在想什么，就对那个右手枯萎的人说：“起来，站在中间。”那人站起来。于是耶稣对他们说：“你们中间谁要在这安息日救羊脱离狮子的口呢？

难道这人不许在安息日行善、救命吗？”他环视众人一圈，然后对那人说：“伸出你的手来。”那人伸手一伸，右手立刻好了，像左手一样。但他们却非常愤怒，并开始商量如何除掉耶稣。

这是神的话语。我们正在研究路加福音中耶稣的生活和他的教导。过去几周里，我们在探讨跟随耶稣意味着什么，做一个门徒意味着什么。当然，耶稣实际上是在讲传扬福音，他所说的是他的门徒如何将福音应用到生活的每一个领域。

今天我们要探讨的是十诫中的第四条诫命，它记载在出埃及记20章。六日要劳碌作你一切的工，但第七日是向耶和华你神当守的安息日。这一日你要做各样的工作。因为在第六日，耶和华造了天、地、海，并地上的一切，就安息了，因此耶和华赐福与安息日，定为圣日。

现在我知道我们每个人对工作的关系都不尽相同。有些人在这里希望找到更多的工作机会，而有些人则告诉我他们工作中缺乏纪律感。但总的来说，在纽约市中心，最大的问题之一就是如何获得安息日的休息，也就是遵守安息日的纪律。为什么我们需要它？

我们从哪里得到它？又该如何去做？为什么我们需要它？我们从哪里得到它？

又该如何去做？这一切都在这里有所说明。首先，为什么**我们需要它呢？请看1-2节。**

耶稣和门徒经过一个庄稼地时，正是安息日，他们摘了些麦穗，在手里搓着吃里面的麦粒。法利赛人就指责他们，说他们在安息日做了工。因为在当时，根据halaka（犹太教规），收割麦子是39种被禁止在安息日做的工作之一。一听到这个，我们就会觉得这是对安息日的极大亵渎。

我们立刻会觉得这些规定多么僵化、多么道德主义，多么难以接受。但我们要注意耶稣的回答并不是说：“我是来废掉安息日的。” 或者“我们要超越这一切。” 他并没有这么说。

他说：“人子是安息日的主。”我们一会儿再讨论这句话，但至少它意味着：我非常重视安息日。安息日是我关注的重点，**这意味着我们要从这一点开始学习。**有史以来最敬业的文化就是我们自己，我们不敢对任何努力不屑一顾，哪怕这些努力是错的，只要它们是为了给人们提供一种至关重要的东西——休息。

纽约时报杂志的作家朱达·舒洛维茨（Judas Schulovitz），可能是在《纽约时报书评》上撰稿的人，在今年三月初的第一周，她在《纽约时报杂志》上发表了一篇文章，题目是《让我们重新找回安息日》。她这样写道：首先，她简单介绍了自己。她说自己可能是被养在纽约的，我也不确定，但她是成长在一个宗教社区的犹太会堂里的。然而像大多数世俗的专业纽约人一样，她抵制并基本上离开了她的宗教背景，然后她开始经历一种现象。

这是她对自己这种状况的描述：我的心情每周末都会变得阴郁起来。直到周六下午，我已经变得反应迟钝、情绪低落了。我平时与朋友一起吃早午餐的习惯让我感到无比焦躁不安。然后我开始做了一件在我十几岁的时候，被宗教教育深深排斥，我从未想过会想要做的事情：我开始去附近的一家犹太会堂串门。

最后，我形成了一种理论来解释我的状况。如果过去人们是从安息日的种种规定中受苦的话，那么我现在则是从缺乏这些规定中受苦。有充分的证据表明我们与工作的关系已经失衡了。让我为一种已经维持了几千年、对工作和平衡有着合理约束的制度辩护吧。

大多数人都错误地认为，要停止工作只需要不工作就可以了。但发明安息日的人们明白这是一项更为复杂的任务。你不能轻易地放慢脚步。这就是为什么清教徒和犹太人的安息日如此刻意的原因。

这些规定并不是为了折磨信徒而存在的。打断无休止的努力需要一种令人惊讶的意志力行为。这种行为必须通过习惯和社交认可来增强。而她所说的正是这一点。

尽管她知道这一点，并且认识到滥用的可能性，我们作为一个社会与工作的关系是如此严重失衡。认为只要感到疲倦就可以随时停止工作就能得到休息的想法是极其天真。深度休息的能力至关重要，没有人可以没有它。但它并不是自然而然的。

它不是简单的，而是绝对艰难的。这需要极大的自律和练习。这就是她在说什么。那么为什么会这样？

为什么这么难？首先，我们必须看看我们现代的情况。我将简要地谈谈这一点。现代社会意味着永恒的人类对休息的需求被极大地加剧了。

让我给你列出四个趋势：A、B、C 和 D。趋势一 A 是这样一个事实，在西方文化中，越来越多的工作变得不安全。工作的概念是保持部门的稳定。如果它们不能表现良好，或者不能盈利，就会被取消。

工作保障从来不是一种文化现象。我认为从未有过如此糟糕的工作保障情况。其次，这些大问题可以概括为几个要点。关于公司高层和底层员工薪酬差距的研究显示，过去高层人员的收入大约是底层人员的10到20倍。

而现在这个比例可能达到了100到200倍。部分由于这种现象，越来越多高薪人士被期望投入大量的工作时间。如果不这样做，就会有人排在你后面。而底层员工则不得不同时从事多份工作以维持生计。

无论你在哪个层级，每个人都超负荷工作。A技术趋势也是如此。你可以工作在任何地方，**这意味着现在我们无处不在地工作。****这意味着你的工作不可能被限制在生活的某个角落里。**

这就是C和D。第四种趋势，而且这稍微复杂一些。文化分析师们说，并且基本上所有人都同意这一点：传统社会认为，你的人生意义来自家庭。你的人生意义来自家庭，通过履行一个相对固定的社会角色来获得——无论是作为母亲、父亲、兄弟、姐妹，丈夫、妻子、儿子或女儿。

而在那种情况下，工作并不是那么重要。你需要找到谋生的方式，因为家庭就是一切。但我们是历史上第一个认为你应该通过决定自己想要成为什么样的人并实现它来定义自己的文化。然后你就会有意义感，**这意味着工作在心理上、社会上和情感上都承受着前所未有的压力，必须让人感到充实或者至少是有回报的。**

从来没有一个文化像这样，**这意味着A、B、C、D，你知道，我们比以往任何时候更需要休息，却比以往任何时候都没有更多的时间来休息。**而D意味着我们在内心深处比任何文化中的任何人都更缺乏放松和休息的能力。但现代情况虽然糟糕，令人沮丧，安息日作为一种古老的实践，是因为有一个持久的人类问题一直存在。显然，安息日并不是对现代忙碌生活的回应。

那么，是什么已经存在于那里需要被安息日解决呢？当犹滴·舒洛维茨说：“当安息日仍然神圣的时候，不仅劳苦变成了节日、家庭聚会和偶尔的礼拜，而且自我审查的机器也停止运转了，静止了那永恒的内心谴责的声音。”她指出了那个更深层次的问题。内在的机械装置，她在说什么呢？

睡眠专家知道，为了恢复体力，不只是需要睡眠的数量，还需要深度睡眠，也就是他们所说的REM睡眠，即快速眼球运动睡眠。当然，他们还说，我认为这只有在经过一定时间后才会发生。换句话说，如果你一天睡了八个小时，但分成八个一小时的小憩，第二天你仍然会感到极度疲劳，因为你必须先睡够一段时间才能进入深度睡眠和REM睡眠阶段。因此，不只是睡眠的时间长短，更重要的是深度睡眠的质量。

听她怎么说，我所说的是一方面是外在的工作，你需要从体力劳动中得到休息，但还存在一个更深层次的问题。有一种内在的机械装置，一种自我审查机制。她说的是什么意思？这并不是罪疚感，而是需要向自己、他人证明自己的需求。

这种工作会让其他类型的工作变得异常疲惫。这就是疲劳的原因所在。这种非常艰难的工作，你总是试图证明自己，确保你的努力永远不够好。你永远不会觉得足够好。

正因为如此，你需要那种灵魂的深度休息和精神上的安息，否则所有的假期都帮不上忙。如果你休假了，停止工作了，但无法处理那些深层次的问题，不能得到那种更深层的精神休息，你会一直感到疲惫。所以，在大的休息之下，除了身体上的休息，还需要深刻的灵性休息。比如，你知道的好莱坞电影《洛奇》第一部中，当洛奇被问到为什么如此努力时，他为什么会这样做？

为什么在小意大利和费城的街道上奔跑、吹响号角并爬上艺术博物馆的台阶时会如此拼命工作？翻译如下： 内在的机械装置，她在说什么呢？睡眠专家知道，为了恢复体力，不只是需要睡眠的数量，还需要深度睡眠，也就是他们所说的REM睡眠，即快速眼球运动睡眠。当然，他们还说，我认为这只有在经过一定时间后才会发生。

换句话说，如果你一天睡了八个小时，但分成八个一小时的小憩，第二天你仍然会感到极度疲劳，因为你必须先睡够一段时间才能进入深度睡眠和REM睡眠阶段。因此，不只是睡眠的时间长短，更重要的是深度睡眠的质量。听她怎么说，我所说的是一方面是外在的工作，你需要从体力劳动中得到休息，但还存在一个更深层次的问题。有一种内在的机械装置，一种自我审查机制。

所以，在大的休息之下，除了身体上的休息，还需要深刻的灵性休息。比如，《洛奇》第一部中，当洛奇被问到为什么如此努力时，他为什么会这样做？为什么在小意大利和费城的街道上奔跑、吹响号角并爬上艺术博物馆的台阶时会如此拼命工作？他的回答是：“我要跑完全程，这样我才知道我不是懦夫。

”所以这位英雄被永恒的内心谴责声驱使着。内心的机器。这就是他为何如此努力的原因。这也是他能够到达顶峰的原因之一。

这也就是为什么他会精疲力尽。这也解释了其他电影为何会糟糕透顶。深层的灵魂休息之需是深刻的，没有它，身体上的休息对你毫无帮助。所以**我们需要安息日的休息。**

我们比以往任何时候都需要这种休息，但我们确实需要它。这就是**我们需要它的原因。**第一点，第二点，我们要在哪里找到这种休息呢？现在让我们看看耶稣怎么说。

他们说他违反了安息日的规定，那他是怎么回应的？他说：“你们读过大卫在逃亡时和同伴们饥饿时所做的吗？”“他进入神殿，取了圣饼来吃，这本是祭司才能吃的，还给了他的同伴。”有趣的是，在这里耶稣引用了撒母耳记上21章的故事。

当时大卫为了逃避追杀，进入了会幕。在会幕里有陈设饼，那是献给神的面包，放在至圣所内。会幕的一部分是用来进行安息日崇拜的，是不允许吃这些饼的。但大卫却吃了。

当然，正如耶稣暗示的那样，他从未因此受到谴责。神也没有说他这样做有什么不对。他从来没有因为这件事受到过任何谴责。现在耶稣邀请我们思考这个故事的意义。

如果在紧急情况下，安息日和崇拜的规定可以被搁置一旁，那么另一方面，在圣经中没有任何地方提到道德律法可以在紧急情况下被搁置。圣经中没有一处说：“你赶时间了，所以通奸是可以的；拜偶像也是可以的；偷窃、抢劫、持械抢劫，这些都可以。”你知道，那样的话你就麻烦大了。你本应在任何情况下都不可违背道德律法，但可以暂时搁置安息日和其他礼仪与崇拜的规定。

这表示什么？让我们思考一下。**这意味着这些规定是临时性的，意味着它们将在某样东西出现时结束，而那东西会使其变得过时并取代它。**那么那是什么呢？

耶稣在下一节经文中给出了答案。接着，耶稣对他们说：“我就是安息日的主。”这真是令人震惊。让我们想一想他的话。

他实际上要表达的内容远不止我能在这次讲道中展开的，但他说了这些： 我是你们所有安息日规定的应许者。我可以给你们灵魂**真正的安息，这是**你们最需要的。我是安息的主。耶稣，我是安息的主。

**这意味着两件事。**如果你想要安息，你必须去找他。而如果你以为已经找到了他却仍然没有得到安息，那么你还未真正理解或掌握你所拥有的。现在，为什么和如何他是安息的主呢？

好吧， 让我带你去看三个相关的经文段落。这些其他重要的经文会帮助我们理解“我是安息的主”意味着什么，“给我带来安息”又是什么意思？首先，让我们回到圣经中关于这个主题的原始经文。你得追溯到创世记1章的结尾和2章的开头，在那里上帝刚刚完成了创造世界的工作。

这是原文： 于是神看所造的一切都甚好。到了第七日，神造物的工已经完毕，便在第七日歇了他一切的工。但“神歇了”是什么意思？他是累了么？

神不可能累。既然神不可能累，那么他说“歇了”又意味着什么呢？对于我们和你我来说，“安息”的定义是摆脱疲劳。那么如果神没有感到疲劳，他“歇了”又意味着什么？

创世记 2:1-3 And God saw that the work was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning, the sixth day. So the heavens and the earth were completed with all their hosts. And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done. 这里就是答案了。创造记述中有一件非常有趣的事情，每当神造出一样东西之后再转向别的事物之前，他都会重复说同样的话。你知道是什么吗？他会造出一样东西，然后看看它，说：“好。

”“很好。”然后再造另一样东西，又说：“好。” 当他造到最后一件东西时——也就是我刚才读的部分，他环视自己所造的一切，说：“非常好。”这就是神的安息的意思。

就是完全满意于已经完成的事。完全满意。这是唯一能让你离开的方式。这是唯一能让你停止的方式。

只有当你对所做的事完全满意时，才能放下手中的工作。这很好。这很好。现在你可以安息了。

现在你可以放松了。所以你看，神的安息就是完全满意于已完成的工作。第二点，翻到希伯来书第四章。这里在谈论福音。

希伯来书作者正在向基督徒解释什么是相信耶稣。当他谈到福音和相信耶稣时，突然说：“于是，神为信他的人预备了安息。”“对于那些通过福音进入神的安息中的人来说，就是从自己的工作得到安息，正如神从他的工作中休息一样。” 这是一个惊人的声明。

成为基督徒意味着什么？有很多方式来表达这一点。你之所以需要每一种说法，是因为你需要理解其中的丰富含义。成为基督徒就是在耶稣基督里能够以神的眼光看待你的工作和生活的人。

这里告诉你的是：通过耶稣基督，你可以以全新的视角来看待自己的生命。你可以对自己说：“这完全令人满意。”“这是绝对好的。”“不需要再做任何事情了。

” 一切都已经完成了。我们大多数人估计每天大约有一半清醒时间是在工作的。圣经中的智慧如何应用于我们的职业生涯？换句话说，我们的工作如何与神的工作相连，我们的职业又该如何更加充满情感呢？

在《Every Good and Very Useful》一书中，提摩太·凯勒从数十年的职业和呼召教学中汲取灵感，向我们展示了如何在服侍神和他人中找到工作的真正喜悦。这本书提供了关于基督教视角下的工作如何成为繁荣事业和个人生活的基础的惊人见解。每一项美好的努力都是我们对帮助福音与生活将基督之爱带给世界各地的人们的礼物表达感谢的方式。请访问gospelandlife.com/give。

那就是gospelandlife.com/give。现在，让我们听听凯勒博士今天的余下部分教导。这怎么可能呢？这又是怎么做到的呢？

但你看，再看一次，朱达·舒洛维茨。我要再次回到她那里，因为她的文章非常精彩。她给了我们深刻的见解，并且这样说： 她说：“甚至我们的团体休闲活动也无法为我们提供安息日仪式曾经能够提供的那种休息。”听到了吗？

她说，“你不能仅仅停止工作然后去享受所有的休闲活动。” 那并不能给你带来永恒内心的平静和内在机制的安宁。哦不，她说，“不是这样的，她还说，团体的休闲活动也不能为我们提供安息日仪式曾经能够提供的那种休息，因为宗教仪式不仅仅是为了促进团契。” 它们是设计来向我们讲述一个关于我们是谁的故事。

安息日所讲述的故事是关于创造的。神休息了，我们也应该休息以尊荣我们心中的神性形象，提醒我们自己不仅仅是工作的人。现在她基本上已经准确地揭示了希伯来书作者想要表达的内容。记得我们说过这里还有更深层次的工作吗？

有身体上的工作，但真正让人忧虑、疲惫的不是身体上的工作，因为听我说，你回到创世记中去，在伊甸园里就有工作。换句话说，**真正的问题不是**工作的存在，而是深层次休息的缺失。所以有外部的工作，但还有这里的工作。那是什么？

她知道那是什么。她已经谈论过它了。她把永恒内心的低语称为自我接近，但这到底是什么呢？这是在试图了解你是谁。

这是想向别人和你自己展示：我知道我是重要的人或对我而言是重要的某人。你通过行动来做这件事。每一个人都这样做。宗教徒说，如果我真的很善良，并且做了很多很多的好事，上帝就会赐福给我。

然而世俗的人虽然不相信上帝或法律或圣经等任何东西，但他们设定了自己的标准，整个自我形象都依赖于达到这些标准和实现这些目标。这就是他们所谓的“工作”，在工作的背后。但这种工作永远不会结束。永远不会结束。

它永远没有尽头。永远不够。你永远无法在那种情况下说：“很好。”也许有一天偶尔会这样，但明天呢？

总是有明天。你永远无法像上帝所说的那样找到安息——能够看着自己说：“我很满意。” “这很好。”“已经结束了。

”然而希伯来书的作者说，只有通过耶稣，才能得到这种安息。耶稣曾说过：“你们劳苦担重担的人哪，到我这里来，我就使你们得安息。我心里柔和谦卑，你们当负我的轭，学我的样式；这样，你们心里就必得享安息。”“因为我的轭是容易的，我的担子是轻省的。

” 他说的是：每个人都在为某事服务，在某种意义上寻求身份认同。但只有当你让我成为你生命的意义时，你才能获得绝对的安息。只有通过我，你才能看着自己、你的工作和一切说：“已经结束了。”所有必须完成的事情都已经完成了。

“这很好。”这是怎么做到的呢？这就是可能的方式： 通过耶稣怎么可能做到呢？这里就是可能的方式。

看看最后一节经文。这一节经文里有一个巨大的讽刺之处。你必须把第11节和第5节放在一起看。当他们愤怒地讨论要怎样处置耶稣的时候。

他们为什么这么愤怒呢？你知道他说“我是安息日的主”是什么意思吗？他是说他自己创造了安息日。他是来完成安息日的。

他在攀爬成为神的位置。除了说必须做点什么，他们别无选择。他们决定要做些什么呢？他们对他很生气。

最终他们会怎样处置他？你知道他们最后做了什么呢？他们没有杀他，但你明白**这意味着什么吗？这让他成了安息日的主。**

他们只是让他成了安息日的主。为什么？因为在十字架上，你看他在复活。你能看到他在哭泣吗？

你能听到他在呼喊吗？为什么他会如此不安？两节经文：以赛亚书57章20节。恶人像翻腾不止的大海，不能平静；江河涨满泥沙和污物。

恶人没有平安。哥林多后书5章21节。在十字架上神使他成了咒诅，虽然他自己毫无罪过，好叫我们因信称义。耶稣在那里发生了什么？

为什么他会这样做？为什么他在呼喊？为什么他在挣扎？他在经历。

神让他经历这一切，因为神正在远离他。无穷的不安。那些远离神的人没有安宁。他在经历这一切。

无穷的不安。宇宙般的不安。为什么呢？这样，当他死的时候，就能说出那句话：“成了。

”什么是“成了”？所有对于救赎所必要的，对最苛刻的良心来说都已完备；对最完美主义、永恒、内在良知的每一个要求都已经满足了。你明白吗？换句话说，耶稣基督来活了一本你本该完美生活的账簿，并且承担了你本应承受的刑罚，这样当神看你的时候，因为你已经接受了基督作为救主， 接受基督作为救主意味着什么呢？

什么是基督徒？不是说我打算努力像耶稣那样，帮助我。做一个基督徒意味着我说，我不靠自己的行为，而是靠他的。我倚靠他已完成的工作。

接受我，不是因为我的记录，而是因为他那完美的记录。接受我，不是因为我所做的，而是因为他所成就的。当你这么说的时候，神就会将你的罪归到他身上。哥林多后书5章21节的意思就是这个。

神会把他的义算给你，也就是说，当神在基督里看你是怎样的人时，他会说：“很好。”而你所需要做的每一件事都已经完成了。世界上唯一能证明自己的眼睛已经告诉你：这是我的爱子，我为他感到满意。记得，杰瑞，这是一场火。

两个人。至于安息日，这是我过去50年里唯一一部关于安息日的电影。一个家伙不停工作，他是短跑运动员，有人问他，就像问罗克一样：“你为什么这么努力去参加奥运会并赢得奖牌？” 他的回答是：我只有10秒的时间，他指的是百米冲刺。

我要用这10秒证明自己的存在。我在努力弄清楚我是谁。我在做朱迪思·施尔所说的那项工作——所有工作的基础。所以他很拼命，但另一个人发现金牌比赛将在周日举行。

他是基督徒，并且致力于遵守安息日的实践。然而，重要的是，这不是一种法律主义的事情。他因为完全确信自己在基督里的身份，愿意说：“即使**这意味着失去金牌，我也不跑。**” 讽刺的是，第一个家伙赢得了金牌，但这并不足够。

永远不够，因为真正让你疲惫不堪的工作——那些使你精疲力尽的工作——只有在耶稣里才能完成。在耶稣里，神说：“很好。” 在耶稣里，神看你时会说：“很好。”在耶稣里，你会听到“已经完成了”。

理解这一点后，你可以转向第三个要点。第三点是，只有当你真正获得了耶稣基督所提供的深度安息之后，你才能转而问出“我们该怎么做？”任何你在没有理解我刚才所说的前提下尝试实践安息日、休息或远离工作的事情都不会奏效。专注并不能解决深层次的问题——灵魂的深度安息和REM阶段。

但一旦你理解了这一点，请允许我至少列出几项内容。我们如何学习去做这件事？如何实际地去实践安息？这里有一些要点，我必须快速说明。

显然，我不能详细展开，但耶稣在最后所做的事是，在安息日治愈了一名病人。根据当时哈拉卡（Halak）的规定，如果那人濒临死亡，可以进行医疗救治。如果情况危急，你通常不能在安息日做这种治疗。所以他违反了安息日的规矩，但他没有说：“我这么做是因为安息日已经废除了。

”我们不再需要遵守安息日的规矩。他并没有这么说。他像是在说安息日仍然有效。他说：“你们看，在安息日是行善还是作恶？

”他的意思是，我在做应该在安息日做的事情——恢复性的行为。我治愈了那个枯萎的人。所以耶稣在这里告诉我们的是不幸的事实： 大多数基督徒认为，由于耶稣的到来，他已经完成了安息日的使命，我们不再需要遵守旧约中的所有规定，不必有3000条可以做或不可以做的规则。我们可以走这么远，但不能走那么远。

但我们相信这一点，但这却是个问题，因为耶稣说实践安息日仍然是绝对必要的。因为你没有那些规则，作为想要实践安息日的基督徒，你面临的危险更大，因为你没有明确的指导。建议你们实行一些非常重要的修炼。有三种内在修炼和几种外在修炼，这样你们可以将耶稣给予你的恩赐实践出来，让工作与生活的平衡不至于严重偏离轨道。

这涉及到跨领域的修炼。首先，如果不做这三个内在修炼，外在的修炼就无法生效。第一点，跨领域修炼。根据圣经，安息日是一种解放的行为。

在申命记第十五章中，上帝说：“因为我在埃及地曾向你们起誓说：你们到了我所赐给你们的地，不可效法他们。六日要劳碌作你一切的工，但第七日是向耶和华你神当守的安息日。这一日你要停止劳碌。”这段话就是上帝告诉我们的。

这很有趣。虽然上帝说你们曾经是奴隶，但现在自由了，所以应该遵守安息日。为什么呢？显然，首先，奴隶没有休息的日子。

如果你不休息，你就仍然是个奴隶。想想**这意味着什么。**如果你不能休息，如果... 我在这里谈论的不只是收入的朋友。很多人无法拒绝请求，很多人过度承诺，总是太忙，永远都在忙碌。

如果你总是太忙，又不能对别人说不，也不能留出时间来，那你就是个奴隶。你可能是自作自受的奴隶。你是自己需求的奴隶，是自己不安感的奴隶，是你自我救赎需要的奴隶，是你家庭期望的奴隶，是你文化期待的奴隶，是你公司的奴隶。但你仍然是个奴隶。

你必须在内心深处，在自己的灵魂中说：这是一次解放的行为。我的工作并不定义我，基督才是我的定义。我不被获得多少客户、赚多少钱、做得有多好所定义。我不被我变得多么专业所定义。

今天我要休息，今晚也要休息，这一周都要休息。我不再想这些，因为我不再是奴隶。所以这是第一次，也是第二次，这是一次信任的行为。安息日，我们的休息时刻指向神的工作和安息，**这意味着你不是神。**

他是。我们很多人面临的一个问题在于，除非你自己告诉自己这是跨学科的，否则你就无法抽出你需要的时间。你需要对自己说：“我不是维持这个世界运转的人。”“我不是给家人带来收入的人。

”“我不是满足自己需求的人。” 我不是那个存在。神才是那个存在。我不是神。

最好停下来。我得继续讲外部纪律了，好的？有五个外部纪律。如果你做了内部纪律，并且只有在你做了这些之后，你才能在外部纪律中放松下来。

如果你不做好内部的，那你可能会整天疲惫不堪。但这里就是外部纪律。第一点，多安排安息日的时间。有人问，怎么知道要安排多少时间呢？

我一会儿再说，但大概是你现在安排的时间更多一些，好的？多安排安息日的时间。第一点，这很简单。第二点，平衡你的安息日时间，**这意味着做一些业余的、沉思的和不活跃的事情。**

业余活动就是做些你平时不做的一些事情，比如钓鱼，如果你不是靠它谋生的话，对吧？一个靠捕鱼为生的人不应该在休息日去钓鱼，对吧？但也许你可以。业余活动，你需要一些这样的时间，在业余活动中，你能享受神完成的工作和他的创造。

第二点，沉思。正如她所说得完全正确：“仅仅通过做休闲的事情，并不能真正达到休息的深度。”你必须告诉自己你是谁的故事。我们无法安息的原因是我们不确定自己是否安全。

她说过这一点。因此，你需要在你的休息日进行崇拜。事实上，这并不是我的休息日。大家都知道吗？

对我来说这是16小时的一天。当我周二或周三休息时，我从哪里开始呢？我必须从敬拜开始。我必须从敬拜开始。

如果我不从敬拜开始，我就不能在接下来的时间里放松。我必须告诉自己我是谁。我必须讲述自己的故事。业余的、沉思的和不活跃的。

现在，我说这个的意思是，在旧约中，不仅人有安息年，土地也有安息年，你知道吗？每当土地有安息年时，他们会做什么？他们会换种不同的庄稼吗？不，他们会让任何能长出来的植物自然生长。

如果你没有休息，除非你有一些未计划的时间，一些无结构的时间，一些没有家庭聚会的时间，有时候没有业余活动的时间，有时候只是思考任何浮现的想法，感受任何涌现的情绪。你需要有这样的一些时间。这就是一个圣经的原则。所以要平衡你的安息年时间。

首先，多安排一些安息年时间。其次，平衡更多的安息年时间。第三点，对安息年时间负责。在这个世界上，不可能没有一段时间你会过度工作。

我不知道你如何成为一名医生，除非你在住院期间连续三年超负荷工作。我不知道你是如何开始一项业务而不在初期超负荷工作的，但你需要有责任感。你需要看着某人的眼睛说，在两年、一年或三年结束时，停止我吧，因为我不想在余生中一直处于未安排安息年的时间模式。你们中有多少人知道盘子的比喻？

你在开玩笑。当我来这里的时候，我对我的妻子和孩子说，我要连续工作大约三年，因为我们要开始一个教会，但之后会很好。三年半、四年，没有改变我的日程。有一天，我回到公寓里，天气很暖和，阳台开着门，我看到我的妻子在那里。

她拿着我们的结婚盘子——那是我们刚结婚时收到的盘子，并且手里有一把锤子。并且当我进来时，我听到了一声破碎的声音，然后我向外看去，她就在那里，又放下了另一个盘子，并拿起锤子开始砸那些盘子。我走上前说：“发生了什么事？” 她回答说：“你还没有听到我的话。

” 你说过你会在某个时候关机。你没有给自己足够的休息时间。你没有遵守安息日。你没有实践安息日，也没有听我的话，你不知道这有多么严重。

你根本没听我说的话。我非常生气，甚至哭了，真不敢相信你会这么生气。她说：“我不是那么生气。” 她说：“当然你应该会这样认为。

” 我当时确实很生气，但这件事让我深思，并且我做出了改变。不久之后，我对她说道：“你知道吗，你说你不生气是什么意思？” 她说：“我真的没有生气。”我说：“那你怎么会不生气呢？

” 她说：“那些我砸的盘子，都是我们不再需要杯子的盘子。” 责任感很重要。第四点，在工作中注入安息日时间。换句话说，在旧约中有一条规定，叫作拾遗穗，意思是不能把庄稼全部收割到田地的角落里。

这是一种对生产力的限制，防止过度劳累。仅仅像魔鬼一样工作然后休息是不够的。**这意味着设定更少的目标。**意味着在你生命中的某个时刻真正实践这一点，真正找到与工作的正确关系。

你可能不得不冒着职业生涯落后的风险，否则你就不能成为门徒。换句话说，在某个时候你会说：“我要做我需要做的事情。” 业余地、沉思地去做我的安息日。我不会让工作完全压垮自己。

如果你这样做，你可能会在职业上落后。也许上帝会让你这样，也许不会。那一切都由祂来决定。无论怎样，你都会是清醒的。

即使你在努力赶超别人时落后了也没关系。所以，请多利用安息日时间，平衡你的安息日时间，对安息日负责，将安息日融入工作和社区中。社区。我已经暗示过这一点。

你们只有找到其他同样工作的伙伴一起头脑风暴，才能想出如何避免被工作压垮的方法。如何让工作回归其应有的位置？如何享受休闲时光？如何休息？

你只需要向唯一能够证明自己的人——现在看着你的那双眼睛——表明一切是好的。已经完成了。让这句话深深扎根在你们的生命中。这将改变你们对工作的态度。

让我们祷告。感谢祢，赐给我们所需的知识，使我们能拥有内心的平静和稳重。我们的生命中有这种宁静，因为我们知道耶稣基督已完成了一切必要的工作。祂已经完成了任务。

因此，我们祈求能够审视我们所做的其他工作，不要消除我们的完美主义、过度劳累或不足劳作。我知道主啊，许多人都因为害怕失败而不足劳作。许多人因害怕失败而不足劳作。福音也解除了这种恐惧，因为在耶稣基督里，一切都已完成。

感谢祢，赐给我们这样的可能性，但我们也知道我们无法独自实现这一点。求祢借着圣灵的帮助帮助我们。我们在耶稣的名中祈求，阿门。感谢您收听蒂姆·凯勒在《福音与生活播客》上的讲道。
