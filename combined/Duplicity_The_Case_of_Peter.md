## 引言与经文诵读 / Introduction and Scripture Reading

Welcome to Gospel in Life. You don't have to look far to see that something's deeply wrong with our world and with us. But is there an answer that gets to the root of why?

In today's message, Tim Keller explores the human condition through stories in the Bible, uncovering what Scripture says about sin and why it's the only explanation deep enough to face the truth about ourselves. Recently, there was an inner church meeting of Christian men in the city called Promise Keepers. I got a chance to speak at it.

The most unflattering way to put it, the most unflattering way to explain that movement is to try to make Christian men make and keep more promises, make and keep more commitments. It was interesting that at that time, I was already preparing a sermon on the issue of integrity and Peter, and this incident here tells us, especially the case of Peter, tells us more about the power of commitments and the power of promise keeping. I think any other incident in the Scripture.

Let me read it to you. Peter was sitting out in the courtyard and a servant girl came to him. You also were with Jesus of Galilee, she said, but he denied it before them all.

I don't know what you're talking about, he said. Then he went out to the gateway where another girl saw him and said to the people there, this fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth. He denied it again with an oath.

I don't know the man. After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, surely you are one of them. For your accent gives you a way.

Then he began to call down curses on himself and he swore to them, I don't know the man. Immediately a rooster crowed and then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken. Before the rooster crowed, you will disown me three times and he went outside and wept bitterly.

This is God's word. You see, earlier in the chapter, at the last supper, Jesus had turned to Peter. That's what the reference is there in verse 74.

Jesus had turned to Peter and said, Peter, before the nights out, you're going to betray me. You're going to deny me three times. Three times, before the rooster crowed that dawn, you will deny that you even know me.

And Peter said, at that point, up in verse 35, Peter said, even if I have to die, I will never disown you. That's a promise. That's a commitment.

Peter says, even if it means my life, I will never disown you. And yet, by verse 73, 74, 75, he's doing it. In verse 35, he made a promise that 40 verses later he's breaking the promise.

And we're told in verse 75, and this is what I want to look at in particular with you, he went out and wept bitterly. You went out and he wept bitterly. Not just he wept bitterly.

Why? He was an absolutely broken man in the profoundest possible way. And yet within weeks, within weeks, he was poised as the leader of a new movement, the Christian movement that was about to change history, and he was about to become one of the most influential leaders in the history of the world.

What broke him like this and then what restored him so quickly and the answer is the same. And that is promises. What broke him was he did not understand the power of promises.

What restored him was he learned the secret. See, he didn't understand the power of promise breaking, but then he after that he learned the secret of promise keeping. And promises is the reason he was broken and promises is the reason he was restored.

And I'm going to just propose to you that the bitterness of our lives, see Peter went out and went bitterly that a lot of the bitterness of our lives comes from our inability to make or keep promises, to make or keep commitments. Now, when I use the word promises during the rest of this talk, the rest of this sermon, I don't want people to immediately think of formal contracts. There's a place in the sermon on the mount where Jesus says, I say unto you, don't swear at all, but let your yes be s and let your no be no.

Now, a lot of people have misinterpreted that as meaning Jesus saying never take a vow. That's not what he means. He says, don't swear, but let your yes be s and your no be no.

What he means is a Christian should be someone that every yes and every no, everything you say you ought to treat as a commitment. Whether or not you say I promise, whether or not you sign on a dotted line, whether or not you make it formal, there are not there are not to be degrees of integrity in my people, says Jesus. There's not supposed to be levels of commitment.

If you say to somebody, I'll pray for you. If you say to somebody, I'll call you. If you say to somebody, I'll look you up.

If you say to somebody, I'll look in on you. Jesus says, that's a commitment. Christians, my people are supposed to be people of their word, people who are dependable, people of integrity.

See, so promise keeping to Jesus is not just mean the ones where you say, I promise, where you put your hand up in the air. Let's take a look at what Peter learned and we'll look at it under two heavens. The first heading is, how promises make us and then the second heading is, how we can make promises.

How promises make us and then how we can make promises. First, how promises make us, this is the power of promises. Why was it that Peter went out and wept bitterly?

Because promises make identity and they make community. Did you hear that? They make identity and they make community without promises, without commitment, without the willingness to make a commitment to deny yourself, to limit your options and to hold yourself to a course of action that you stick with no matter what.

That's a commitment. That's a promise. Without promises, there's no identity and there's no community and Peter lost both of them at the moment.

欢迎来到生命中的福音。你不必看得太远就能发现，我们的世界和我们自己有些地方出了严重的问题。但有没有一个答案能够触及问题的根源呢？

在今天的信息中，提摩太·凯勒通过圣经中的故事探索人类的处境，揭示圣经对罪的看法，以及为什么这是唯一足够深刻的解释来面对我们自己的真相。最近，在这座城市里有一个基督徒男士的教会内部聚会，叫做守约者。我有机会在那里讲话。

用最不讨好的方式来说，解释这个运动最不讨好的方式，就是试图让基督徒男士做出并信守更多的承诺，做出并信守更多的委身。有趣的是，在那个时候，我已经在准备一篇关于诚信和彼得的讲道，这里的这个事件告诉我们，特别是彼得的案例，告诉我们更多关于承诺的力量和信守承诺的力量。我认为这比圣经中任何其他事件都更能说明问题。

让我给你们读一下。彼得坐在外面的院子里，有一个使女前来对他说："你也曾和加利利人耶稣在一起。"他在众人面前却不承认。

他说："我不知道你在说什么。"后来他出去到了门口，另一个使女看见他，就对那里的人说："这个人也曾和拿撒勒人耶稣在一起。"彼得又不承认，并且起誓说："我不认识那个人。"

过了不久，旁边站着的人前来对彼得说："你确实是他们一伙的，因为你的口音把你露出来了。"

彼得就发咒起誓，对他们说："我不认识那个人。"立时鸡就叫了。彼得想起耶稣所说的话："鸡叫以先，你要三次不认我。"他就出去痛哭。

这是神的话语。你看，在本章的前面，在最后的晚餐上，耶稣转向彼得。这就是第74节那里所指的。

耶稣转向彼得说："彼得，在今晚结束之前，你会背叛我。你会三次不认我。在黎明鸡叫以前，你会三次否认你甚至认识我。"

彼得当时说，在第35节，彼得说："我就是必须和你同死，也总不能不认你。"这是一个承诺。这是一个委身。

彼得说，即使这意味着我的生命，我也永远不会不认你。然而，到了第73、74、75节，他正在做这件事。在第35节，他做了一个承诺，40节经文之后他就打破了这个承诺。

我们在第75节被告知，这是我特别想和你们一起看的，他就出去痛哭。他出去痛哭。不只是他痛哭。

为什么？他是一个以最深刻的方式完全破碎的人。然而在几周之内，在几周之内，他作为一个新运动的领袖准备就绪，这个基督教运动即将改变历史，他即将成为世界历史上最有影响力的领袖之一。

是什么像这样击碎了他，然后又是什么如此迅速地恢复了他，答案是一样的。那就是承诺。击碎他的是他不明白承诺的力量。

恢复他的是他学会了秘密。看，他不明白违背承诺的力量，但之后他学会了信守承诺的秘密。承诺是他破碎的原因，承诺也是他得到恢复的原因。

我要向你们提出，我们生命中的痛苦，看彼得出去痛哭，我们生命中的许多痛苦来自于我们无法做出或信守承诺，无法做出或信守委身。现在，当我在这次讲道的其余部分使用"承诺"这个词时，我不希望人们立即想到正式的合同。在登山宝训中有一处，耶稣说："只是我告诉你们，什么誓都不可起，但你们的话，是就说是，不是就说不是。"

现在，很多人误解了这个意思，认为耶稣在说永远不要起誓。那不是他的意思。他说，不要起誓，但你们的话，是就说是，不是就说不是。

他的意思是，基督徒应该是这样的人，你说的每一个"是"和每一个"不是"，你说的每一件事都应该被视为一个承诺。无论你是否说"我承诺"，无论你是否在虚线上签名，无论你是否使它正式化，耶稣说，在我的子民中，不应该有不同程度的诚信。不应该有不同层次的委身。

如果你对某人说："我会为你祷告。"如果你对某人说："我会给你打电话。"如果你对某人说："我会去看你。"

如果你对某人说："我会去探望你。"耶稣说，那是一个承诺。基督徒，我的子民应该是信守诺言的人，可靠的人，有诚信的人。

所以，对耶稣来说，信守承诺不仅仅意味着那些你说"我承诺"的时候，你把手举到空中的时候。让我们看看彼得学到了什么，我们将在两个标题下来看。第一个标题是，承诺如何造就我们，然后第二个标题是，我们如何能做出承诺。

承诺如何造就我们，然后我们如何能做出承诺。首先，承诺如何造就我们，这是承诺的力量。为什么彼得出去痛哭？

因为承诺造就身份，它们造就共同体。你听到了吗？它们造就身份和共同体，没有承诺，没有委身，没有愿意做出委身来否定自己，限制你的选择，并坚持一个行动方针，无论如何都要坚持下去。

这就是委身。这就是承诺。没有承诺，就没有身份，也没有共同体，彼得在那一刻失去了这两者。

## 承诺造就身份 / Promises Make Identity

This is what promises make us. First of all promises make identity. Why was Peter wept so bitterly?

I'll tell you why he didn't know who he was. You know why he didn't know who he was? Am I the Peter?

He thought of verse 35 or am I the Peter of verse 74? Which Peter's the real Peter? I don't know.

My life isn't fragments because I couldn't keep a promise. Promises give identity. See, when you ask a modern person what, who are you really?

What is your identity? Another way to put it is who are you really? Modern people tend to say it's my desires and my feelings that tell me who I really am.

That's who I am. My deepest desires. There's an awful lot of talk still, though I hope eventually it will go, you know, it'll pass away.

The last 20 years has been a lot of talk about people saying I need to find myself. I need to find out who I am. And usually in modern parlance it means I need to get out from under all responsibilities, all promises, all obligations, all covenants.

I've got to get away from all obligations and find out what I really feel like so I can find out who I am. Because most modern people say who I am is my deepest feelings. But boy, I hope, you know the reason I hope that this is going to pass away because I'm hoping that baby boomers are getting older.

Because as you get older you begin to realize that your desires, your feelings are not only in conflict with each other but they're even in conflict with themselves, they're in flux. My deepest desires, that who I am but my deepest desires are in conflict with each other. Not only that, they don't even line up with themselves over period of time, they change.

It doesn't work. I mean look, what are your deepest desires? We all want the security of having somebody who's always there for us what we like to freedom to play the field.

You want security and you want freedom in the area of love. You want security and you want freedom in the area of work. You like the security of having money, but you like the freedom of an unstructured life without, you know, the disciplines of a career.

If you're looking to see what you deep, most deeply desire, you'll see that they're at odds with each other. Peter wanted to be the leader of the Christian movement. He also wanted to live.

And, you know, in the past, you know, those are both desires. I would like to survive. I would like to not be tortured.

I would also like to be a great leader and they came together. Who's Peter? You say, well, it's your deepest desire.

Who knows what your deepest desire is? One desire has the ascension for a moment. Another desire has the ascension for the next moment.

Here's Peter. He really wanted to live. That's a desire.

And he really wanted to be a leader. Who is Peter? You say, well, his deepest desire probably was to be a leader.

No, his deepest desire at the moment was to be a coward. Is that all he is? What I'm trying to say is your feelings cannot possibly be the core of your identity because, by definition, your identity has to be that unchangeable core to yourself.

That's always the same. By definition, an identity has to be something which a core of sameness about you that is always the same no matter what the circumstances and no matter what the feelings and no matter what the year. That's what an identity is.

这就是承诺如何造就我们。首先，承诺造就身份。为什么彼得哭得如此痛苦？

我告诉你为什么，他不知道自己是谁。你知道他为什么不知道自己是谁吗？我是第35节的彼得吗？

还是我是第74节的彼得？哪个彼得是真正的彼得？我不知道。

我的生命支离破碎，因为我无法信守承诺。承诺赋予身份。看，当你问一个现代人，你是谁？

你的身份是什么？换一种说法就是你真正是谁？现代人倾向于说，是我的欲望和我的感受告诉我我真正是谁。

那就是我是谁。我最深的欲望。过去20年里有很多这样的谈论，尽管我希望最终它会过去，你知道，它会消失。很多人说我需要找到自己。我需要找出我是谁。在现代用语中，这通常意味着我需要摆脱所有的责任、所有的承诺、所有的义务、所有的约定。

我必须摆脱所有的义务，找出我真正的感受，这样我才能找出我是谁。因为大多数现代人说我是谁就是我最深的感受。但是，我希望，你知道我为什么希望这会过去，因为我希望婴儿潮一代正在变老。

因为随着年龄的增长，你开始意识到你的欲望、你的感受不仅彼此冲突，而且它们甚至与自己冲突，它们在不断变化。我最深的欲望，那是我是谁，但我最深的欲望彼此冲突。不仅如此，随着时间的推移，它们甚至不与自己一致，它们会改变。

这行不通。我的意思是，看，你最深的欲望是什么？我们都想要有人永远在那里陪伴我们的安全感，又想要自由地玩乐的自由。

你在爱的领域想要安全感和自由。你在工作的领域想要安全感和自由。你喜欢拥有金钱的安全感，但你也喜欢一种没有职业纪律约束的自由生活。

如果你想看看你最深的欲望是什么，你会发现它们彼此矛盾。彼得想成为基督教运动的领袖。他也想活下来。

你知道，在过去，你知道，这些都是欲望。我想活下来。我想不被折磨。

我也想成为一位伟大的领袖，它们碰到了一起。彼得是谁？你说，嗯，是你最深的欲望。

谁知道你最深的欲望是什么？一个欲望在某一刻占上风。另一个欲望在下一刻占上风。

这就是彼得。他真的想活下来。那是一个欲望。

他也真的想成为一位领袖。彼得是谁？你说，嗯，他最深的欲望可能是成为一位领袖。

不，他当时最深的欲望是做一个懦夫。他就只是这样吗？我想说的是，你的感受不可能是你身份的核心，因为根据定义，你的身份必须是你自己那个不变的核心。

那总是一样的。根据定义，一个身份必须是关于你的某种核心的不变性，无论环境如何，无论感受如何，无论哪一年，都总是一样的。那就是身份。

## 感受不能成为你的身份 / Your Feelings Cannot Be Your Identity

Therefore, you are not your feelings because your feelings are always changed. It means whatever you're committed to, you are your commitments, you are your promises. If you aren't, if instead in every situation, in every, you following your six circumstances and you're following the impulses, you'll never know who you are and nobody else will either because there's nothing that you always are.

Your identity is what you always are. If there's nothing that you that you can say, I always am that because I'm committed to that and no matter how I feel, no matter what the situation is, no matter what the circumstances are, no matter what people say, I'm committed to that. Unless you've got something like that, you don't know who you are.

There's no identity without promises. Now, this isn't just my idea. Hanna Arrent, not exactly, you know, you're born again minister.

Hanna Arrent, quite a theorist, quite a political analyst, she says, in one of her writings, she says this, without being bound to the fulfillment of our promises, we would never be able to keep an identity. We'd be condemned to wander helplessly without direction and a darkness of each person's heart caught in its contradictions and equivocalities. You hear her?

She says, in your heart, it's filled with contradictions and equivocalities. You'd have no identity unless you are bound to promises. See, Peter could have kept his life together.

How do you keep your life together? Peter could have said, I am he, who will be there with you, Lord Jesus, regardless of public or private, regardless of hard times or easy times, and the promise would have been the thread that bound him together, all of his pieces, all of his parts. That's what integrity is.

The word integrity is the same as our English word integer, which in mathematics means a whole number is opposed to fraction, right? And in the same way, how can you be sure that you are a person of integrity? That means that you are not living your life in fragments or in compartments.

How can you be the same a whole person? How can you be the same in public as in private? How can you be the same with one crowd as with another crowd?

How can you be the same on Mondays you are on Sunday? How can you be the same in what you say and what you do? How can you be the same from one year to the next?

How can you be the same? Only by a promise that pulls it all together. Otherwise, it's my glands, it's my feelings, it's my circumstances, it's public opinion, it's all these things.

Remember, you know, did you see the movie with Bridget Fonda, Nicholas Cage? It could happen to you. It's about a cop, a near cop that promises a waitress that if his this lottery ticket wins, since she made a contribution to it, he'd come back and give her half the winnings.

Then he finds out he won four million dollars. His wife, when he hears, she hears about the promise to the to the waitress says, forget that. It's not in writing, it's not written down anywhere, four million dollars.

You'd be an idiot to go back and he says a promise is a promise and he goes back and he gives the waitress two million dollars. And one thing that's interesting throughout the rest of the film, his wife, you know, the cop's wife who wants nothing but the money and has no other principles than that, goes through multiple transformations of personality and finally collapses. But even though he really pays a price for sticking with his promise, he has a sense of himself and it lasts throughout.

And of course, the best place for this is ever said is in that wonderful play, that wonderful line in man for all seasons where Sir Thomas Moore is being told he's going to burn at the stake unless he recants. And his daughter says, oh please father, his daughter's name is Meg can't you please just go back on your word so that we can have you. And he looks at her and he says when a man makes an oath, Meg, he holds his own self in his hand like water.

And if he opens his fingers, he needn't hope to find himself again. You know why Peter's weeping bitterly? He opened his hand and he was gone.

If you say, well, I got principles, but if it doesn't look like it'd be advantageous to tell the truth. If it doesn't look like it'll be comfortable to do this thing. Well, I'm a pragmatist.

You open your hand and there's nothing left. How does Peter know who he is? He has no idea.

He doesn't have a promise that binds together every part of his life. Is he a Christian or isn't he? Is he for Christ or isn't he?

He doesn't know nobody knows. He can't even trust himself now. He's got no identity.

因此，你不是你的感受，因为你的感受总是在变化。这意味着无论你委身于什么，你就是你的委身，你就是你的承诺。如果你不是，如果相反，在每种情况下，在每种情况下，你跟随你的六种环境，你跟随冲动，你永远不会知道自己是谁，别人也不会知道，因为没有什么是你总是如此的。

你的身份是你总是如此的东西。如果没有什么东西你可以说，我总是这样，因为我委身于此，无论我感觉如何，无论情况如何，无论环境如何，无论人们怎么说，我都委身于此。除非你有这样的东西，否则你不知道自己是谁。

没有承诺就没有身份。现在，这不仅仅是我的想法。汉娜·阿伦特，不完全是，你知道，重生的牧师。

汉娜·阿伦特，相当的理论家，相当的政治分析家，她在她的一篇著作中说，她这样说：如果不受约束去履行我们的承诺，我们将永远无法保持身份。我们会被谴责在每个人内心的黑暗中无助地徘徊，陷入其矛盾和模棱两可之中。你听到她说的了吗？

她说，在你的心中，充满了矛盾和模棱两可。除非你受承诺的约束，否则你就没有身份。看，彼得本可以保持他的生命完整。

你如何保持你的生命完整？彼得本可以说，我就是那个会与你同在的人，主耶稣，无论是在公开场合还是在私下，无论是在艰难时期还是在轻松时期，承诺就会成为把他绑在一起的线，他所有的碎片，他所有的部分。这就是诚信。

"诚信"这个词与我们英语中的"整数"这个词相同，在数学中意味着一个整数，与分数相对，对吧？同样，你如何确信你是一个有诚信的人？这意味着你不是在碎片中或在隔间中生活。

你如何成为同一个完整的人？你如何在公开场合和私下里都一样？你如何在一群人中和另一群人中都一样？

你如何在周一和周日都一样？你如何在言行上都一样？你如何从一年到另一年都一样？

你如何保持一致？只有通过一个把一切拉到一起的承诺。否则，就是我的腺体，是我的感受，是我的环境，是公众舆论，是所有这些东西。

记得吗，你知道，你看过那部有布丽姬·方达和尼古拉斯·凯奇的电影吗？《这可能发生在你身上》。它讲的是一个警察，一个快要成为警察的人，他向一个女服务员承诺，如果他的这张彩票中奖了，由于她对此做出了贡献，他会回来把奖金的一半给她。

然后他发现他赢了400万美元。他的妻子，当他听到，她听到对女服务员的承诺时说，算了吧。这没有写下来，没有写在任何地方，400万美元。

你如果回去就是个傻瓜，他说承诺就是承诺，然后他回去把200万美元给了女服务员。有一件有趣的事情贯穿了电影的其余部分，他的妻子，你知道，这个警察的妻子，她只想要钱，没有其他原则，经历了多次人格转变，最终崩溃了。但即使他真的为坚持自己的承诺付出了代价，他有一种自我意识，而且这种意识一直持续着。

当然，说这个最好的地方是在那部精彩的戏剧中，在《四季之人》中的那句精彩台词，托马斯·莫尔爵士被告知他将被烧死在火刑柱上，除非他撤回。他的女儿说，哦，求求你了，父亲，他女儿的名字是梅格，你能不能收回你的话，这样我们就能拥有你。他看着她说："当一个人起誓时，梅格，他把自己握在手中，就像握着水一样。

如果他张开手指，他就不必指望再找到自己了。"你知道彼得为什么哭得这么痛苦吗？他张开了手，他消失了。

如果你说，好吧，我有原则，但如果说真话看起来不利。如果做这件事看起来不舒服。好吧，我是个实用主义者。

你张开手，什么都没有了。彼得怎么知道自己是谁？他不知道。

他没有一个把他生命的每一部分绑在一起的承诺。他是基督徒还是不是？他是支持基督的还是不是？

他不知道，没有人知道。他现在甚至不能相信自己了。他没有身份。

## 承诺造就共同体 / Promises Make Community

Promises make identity, but also one other thing we have to be brief, but important promises make community. You notice where he goes to weep out. You see that?

Doesn't say, look he says he went outside and wept bitterly. That is not not. That is not just an accident.

That is not an unimportant statement. He went outside and wept. Well, you know why?

You say, well, yeah, it's common sense. When you've broken a promise, when you have broken faith, when you've made a commitment and then you give up on the commitment, you don't say to everybody, hey, let's gather around. I want to weep.

No, you go away. You're alone because promises create community. There is no community without commitment.

For 10 years, I ministered in a small town in the south and there were two men that almost virtually wandered the street. They weren't exactly homeless, but they almost were. They were born and raised there and they were related to half this town, but they never kept promises.

They repeatedly kept breaking their promises. As a result, nobody trusted them and they had no friends. They had a lot of relics.

They had nobody who would be there with them because they were never there for anybody else. I don't like that. They couldn't even trust themselves.

The inevitable consequence, the inevitable result of breaking commitments or even failing to make them is aloneness, isolation, being on the outside. See, in New York, excuse me, I run into people all the time who say, of course, I don't make promises. Ask me no questions.

I'll tell you no lies. I keep my options open. I'm not going to make commitments.

I'm not going to get stuck. I'm going to do that, which will maximize pleasure and profit. So I just want you to know who I am upfront.

I don't make commitments to people. I don't make promises to people. In other words, watch your back when you're around me.

Look, when you have a city like that, you don't have a city, you have a jungle. And that's increasing in the case, is it not? Because if you say, I'm not going to be there for others.

I'm not going to make commitments. To make a commitment is to say, I narrow my options. You can't be a friend unless you narrow your options.

Instead of doing what you want to do tonight, you need to go over and see that friend because you know that friend's going through something. I don't want to go through it. I'd rather go do something else, but he's my friend.

She's my friend. You have no friendship. You have no community without narrowing your options.

Without saying, I've got a program and I'm going to stick with it, regardless of what Lewis Meads is a man who wrote a terrific article on promising. And he has this great line in it. He says, my wife has been married to five different men since her wedding day.

And every one of them has been me. Because he's an old man. He's writing after they've been married for over 50 years.

And in other words, he's talking about how much he's changed over the years. He says, my wife's been married to five different men. Everyone has been me.

But connecting the connecting link that bound each of those men into an integrated hole was the promise I made on my wedding day. That promise gives me an identity. And that identity is I am he who will be there with you.

If I ever shed that name, if I ever broke that promise, I'd never find myself again. And the bond that connects us would break as well. How is the wife over 50 years going to be able to have a relationship with a man who's changing so much and vice versa?

Of course, he's writing from the mail point of view. He says the only way that she's been able to know is because of my promise. If I break that promise, there's no community.

Why should she ever trust me again? Why should I trust myself again? If I leave her to go off with another woman, why should that woman have any confidence that I won't do the same thing to her?

And why should I even think that I will have any confidence that I wouldn't do it again? I open my hand, nothing there, and I'm alone. Always, always, always, the result of promise breaking outside, weeping bitterly, looking around, no one there, including me.

Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache. We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way and what can be done about it?

In his brand new book that's releasing this month, what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer. Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer, Dr.

Keller shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes or choices, or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world will help you see how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us. This newly released book, What Is Wrong with the World, is our thanks for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the good news of Jesus.

Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash give. That's gospelandlife.com slash give. Now here's Dr.

Keller with the rest of today's teaching. Now that's how promises make us. There is no society without people who make commitments and stick with them.

There is no families without it. You know what a family is? A family is when two people get together and they dare to make this promise.

We're going to raise little ones until they're big enough to care for themselves. And if you dare to make that promise, we're going to do it no matter how they act. We're going to do it no matter how they treat us.

If you don't dare to make that promise, you don't have a family. And you only have a family as long as you're keeping that promise. There's no society.

There's no family. There's no marriage. There's no community.

There's no friendship without being willing to rein your own heart in and say, I'm making a point with myself and appointment with myself five years from now, I'm still going to be there for you.

承诺造就身份，但还有另一件事，我们必须简短，但很重要，承诺造就共同体。你注意到他去哪里哭了吗？你看到了吗？

没有说，看，它说他出去痛哭。那不仅仅是一个巧合。

那不是一个不重要的陈述。他出去痛哭。嗯，你知道为什么吗？

你说，嗯，是的，这是常识。当你违背了承诺，当你违背了信任，当你做出了委身然后放弃了委身，你不会对每个人说，嘿，大家围过来。我想哭。

不，你走开了。你是孤独的，因为承诺创造共同体。没有委身就没有共同体。

有10年时间，我在南方的一个小镇服事，那里有两个男人几乎在街上游荡。他们不完全是无家可归，但几乎是。他们在那里出生和长大，与这个镇上的一半人有亲戚关系，但他们从不信守承诺。

他们反复违背承诺。结果，没有人信任他们，他们没有朋友。他们有很多遗物。

他们没有人会和他们在一起，因为他们从不为别人在那里。我不喜欢那样。他们甚至不能相信自己。

违背承诺或甚至未能做出承诺的必然结果是孤独、孤立、在外面。看，在纽约，对不起，我一直遇到这样的人，他们说，当然，我不做承诺。不要问我问题。

我不会告诉你谎言。我保持我的选择开放。我不会做出承诺。

我不会被困住。我要做的是能最大化快乐和利润的事。所以我只想让你预先知道我是谁。

我不对人做出承诺。我不对人做出承诺。换句话说，当你在我周围时要小心。

看，当你有这样一个城市时，你就没有一个城市，你有一个丛林。而且情况越来越严重，不是吗？因为如果你说，我不会为他人在那里。

我不会做出承诺。做出承诺就是说，我缩小了我的选择范围。你不能成为朋友，除非你缩小你的选择范围。

今晚你不做你想做的事，而是需要去看望那个朋友，因为你知道那个朋友正在经历一些事情。我不想经历它。我宁愿去做别的事，但他是我的朋友。

她是我的朋友。没有友谊。没有缩小你的选择范围就没有共同体。

没有说，我有一个计划，我要坚持下去，无论怎样。刘易斯·米德是一个写了一篇关于承诺的精彩文章的人。他在文章中有这样一句很棒的话。他说，我的妻子自从她的婚礼那天起已经嫁给了五个不同的男人。

每一个都是我。因为他是个老人。他是在他们结婚超过50年后写的。

换句话说，他在谈论他这些年来变化了多少。他说，我的妻子嫁给了五个不同的男人。每一个都是我。

但把这些男人连接成一个完整整体的纽带是我在婚礼那天做出的承诺。那个承诺给了我一个身份。那个身份就是我是那个会与你同在的人。

如果我放弃了那个名字，如果我违背了那个承诺，我就再也找不到自己了。连接我们的纽带也会断裂。妻子如何在50多年里能够与一个变化如此之大的男人建立关系，反之亦然？

当然，他是从男性的角度写的。他说她能够知道的唯一方式是因为我的承诺。如果我违背了那个承诺，就没有共同体了。

她为什么还要再次信任我？我为什么要再次信任自己？如果我离开她去和另一个女人在一起，那个女人为什么要有信心我不会对她做同样的事？

为什么我甚至认为我会有信心我不会再这样做？我张开手，什么都没有，而且我是孤独的。总是，总是，总是，违背承诺的结果是在外面，痛哭，环顾四周，没有人在那里，包括我。

我们到处看，我们看到破碎、战争、残酷和心痛。我们在我们周围的世界和我们自己的生活中感受到它。它是如何变成这样的，能做些什么呢？

在他本月发布的全新书中，《世界到底出了什么问题？》提摩太·凯勒提供了一个清晰而富有同情心的答案。从在救赎主教会的一系列教导中提取，凯勒博士展示了罪的现实如何解释我们周围看到的痛苦，以及只有福音提供持久的自由和医治。无论你是对我们世界的状况感到不知所措，还是在与自己的错误或选择作斗争，或者正在寻找希望和喜乐，《世界到底出了什么问题》将帮助你看到福音如何既回应我们世界的心痛，也回应我们每个人内心的痛苦。这本新发布的书《世界到底出了什么问题》是我们对你本月帮助"生命中的福音"分享耶稣好消息的礼物的感谢。

今天就在gospelandlife.com/give索取你的副本。那就是gospelandlife.com/give。现在是凯勒博士今天教导的其余部分。现在这就是承诺如何造就我们。没有做出承诺并坚持的人，就没有社会。

没有家庭就没有它。你知道家庭是什么吗？家庭就是当两个人聚在一起，他们敢于做出这个承诺。

我们要抚养小孩子，直到他们足够大能够照顾自己。如果你敢做出那个承诺，我们要这样做，无论他们如何行事。我们要这样做，无论他们如何对待我们。

如果你不敢做出那个承诺，你就没有家庭。只有当你信守那个承诺时，你才有家庭。没有社会。

没有家庭。没有婚姻。没有共同体。

没有友谊，如果不愿意控制自己的心并说，我现在和五年后的自己有个约定，我仍然会为你在那里。

## 我们如何能做出承诺？ / How Can We Make Promises?

Now question, how can we make promises then? If promises make us, how can we make promises?

And here's why a lot of you are asking this question. I know you're saying, I got problems here. I've got real problems with what you're saying.

You seem to make it sound so simple, but it's not. On the one hand, when you make promises, people take advantage of you. I've made promises and I've been burned.

People have taken advantage of me. I'm afraid to make promises now. New York is full of people, as far as I can see, that have been burned by old promises and who have said, I'm going to be much more careful the next time I do it, if ever.

And then on the other hand, you've got other people who say, the other problem I've got is when I do make promises, I can't stick with them. I can't stick with them. I'm like Peter, I break down.

I can't follow through. But here's the secret. And you have to look at the whole story of Peter to understand.

In John chapter 21, Jesus comes and restores Peter. And in that passage, he just does this. I can give you synopsis.

He does something. First of all, he sits Peter down at a fire. And three times he says, Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me?

Peter says, yes, I do. And then he asks him again, do you love me? And he says, yes, I do.

And a third time, three denials, three questions. Do you love me? And he says, yes, I do.

And after each time, what does Jesus say? I want you to be a leader of my sheep. I want you to feed and lead my flock just like before.

Before you broke the promise, I still want you to lead. I'm going to make you a good leader. But he says to Peter, by the way, you ought to know that if you keep this promise to me now, this new promise you're making, you're going to be killed.

You know, you probably would have been killed if you kept it the first time. Well, now that you've made it again, you're going to be killed anyway. He says, the way he puts it is he says, you'll stretch your hands out on a cross.

You'll be crucified too. And Peter turns to John, the apostle who's right next to him and he says, what about him, Lord? And Jesus looks at Peter and says, what if I decide that you're going to be killed, but he's not?

What business is that of yours? Don't you know who I am? Follow me.

Now, what Peter is told there, you might say, what happened there? Because from then on, Peter was a promise keeper. From then on, Peter kept his word.

From then on, Peter became a tremendous leader. He became a man of identity and community because he kept his commitments because he made the bigger your commitments you make, that you're dare to make and the better you keep him, the more of a sense of self you've got and the more incredible friends you've got. Don't you see that?

It's a scary thing to start a church, but the people who got together and said, we're going to start this church even though it's going to cost us an awful lot. There's a community there. See, the more the promise, the greater the promise, and Peter went on and he experienced the identity in the community.

Well, why? How could that possibly be? And here's the answer.

现在的问题是，那么我们如何能做出承诺？如果承诺造就我们，我们如何能做出承诺？

这就是为什么你们很多人在问这个问题。我知道你们在说，我在这里有问题。我对你说的话有真正的问题。

你似乎让它听起来如此简单，但事实并非如此。一方面，当你做出承诺时，人们会利用你。我做出了承诺，我被伤害了。

人们利用了我。我现在害怕做出承诺。纽约充满了这样的人，据我所见，他们被旧承诺伤害过，他们说，下次我会更加小心，如果还有下次的话。

然后另一方面，你有其他人说，我的另一个问题是，当我做出承诺时，我无法坚持。我无法坚持。我像彼得一样，我崩溃了。

我无法坚持到底。但这就是秘密。你必须看彼得的整个故事才能理解。

在约翰福音第21章，耶稣来恢复彼得。在那段经文中，他只是这样做。我可以给你一个概要。

他做了一件事。首先，他让彼得坐在火边。三次他说："西门，约翰的儿子，你爱我吗？"

彼得说："是的，我爱。"然后他又问他："你爱我吗？"他说："是的，我爱。"

第三次，三次否认，三个问题。"你爱我吗？"他说："是的，我爱。"

每次之后，耶稣说什么？我要你成为我羊群的领袖。我要你喂养和带领我的羊群，就像以前一样。

在你违背承诺之前，我仍然要你带领。我要让你成为一个好领袖。但他对彼得说，顺便说一下，你应该知道，如果你现在向我信守这个承诺，这个你正在做出的新承诺，你会被杀死。

你知道，如果你第一次信守它，你可能已经被杀了。好吧，现在你又做了，无论如何你都会被杀。他说，他这样说：你会在十字架上伸出你的手。

你也会被钉十字架。彼得转向约翰，那个就在他旁边的使徒，他说："主啊，他怎么样呢？"耶稣看着彼得说："如果我决定你会被杀，但他不会呢？"

"那与你何干？你不知道我是谁吗？跟从我。"

现在，彼得在那里被告知，你可能会说，那里发生了什么？因为从那时起，彼得成了一个信守承诺的人。从那时起，彼得信守他的话。

从那时起，彼得成了一位了不起的领袖。他成了一个有身份和共同体的人，因为他信守了自己的承诺，因为他做出了更大的承诺，你敢于做出的承诺越大，你信守得越好，你就越有自我意识，你就有越不可思议的朋友。你不明白吗？

开始一个教会是一件可怕的事情，但那些聚在一起说的人，我们要开始这个教会，即使它会花费我们很多。那里有一个共同体。看，承诺越多，承诺越大，彼得继续前进，他经历了身份和共同体。

那么，为什么？这怎么可能呢？这就是答案。

## 耶稣这位信守承诺者 / Jesus the Promise Keeper

He saw Jesus as a promise keeper. Instead of looking at himself, instead of saying, I can do it. You know, will power.

I can make the promise. I can do it. I know I can.

Instead of drawing strength from will power and looking at himself, he saw Jesus as a promise keeper. He saw three promises that Jesus made. And I say to you, unless you see the same three promises, you'll never be a promised keeper.

You won't be able to be too scared to make commitments, like those of you who've been burned, and you'll be too weak to keep commitments. You'll be too scared to make them. You'll be too weak to keep them.

And as a result, you'll find less identity and less community. Unless you see these three promises that Jesus made, Peter saw them and it changed him forever. He looked away from himself to Jesus the promise keeper.

What were those three? Well, let me just mention them. Jesus promised a judge.

Jesus promised to die. And Jesus promised to forgive. We've got to have them all.

I'm just going to tick them off. Number one, his promise to judge. Jesus Christ says, Peter, I'm in charge.

You live, you die, you die, you live. Don't you understand? I'm in charge.

I am the judge of all the earth. And even though some of you might suffer terribly from keeping a promise, you know, here, let's just take a look at one promise that you're supposed to make as a Christian to always sell the truth. Somebody, you know, here's a person who tells the truth and the boss says, I don't like it, but you've got guts.

You're promoted. So here's another Christian. And this other Christian says, okay, I know I'm a Christian.

I'm going to tell the truth. I know one thing probably. I tell the truth.

And the boss says, I don't like it. You're fired. Right?

Wait a minute, Peter says, you know, why is it that I keep a promise I killed and John's going to keep the promise and he's going to live? Why is it? Jesus says, don't you understand?

I'm the judge. In the end, everything's going to be set straight. Nobody's going to get away with anything.

Listen, friends, unless you have an understanding, a hopeful view of history in the future, unless you understand that there is a God who no matter what promise keeping costs you in the short run, in the end, truth and justice and compassion and righteousness and goodness, the things that you hold to and the things that you base your life on when you make a promise, when you make a promise to God, say, those things are ultimate realities. In this world, sometimes those things mean you'll take it on the chin, but we know that this world isn't the only world there is. We know there's a bigger world.

We know that that's the reason why Peter's able to say, in second Peter 3, we wait according to promise because we know that he is going to judge and the right and the true and the just and the compassionate and the love and goodness, the things that we base our life on, those are ultimate realities. They're going to triumph and therefore those of us who hold to them, we're going to triumph, too. If you don't understand that, what use is there to keep a promise?

They put it another way. Remember those baby boomers? You remember this old enough to remember this commercial?

There was a beer commercial that used to say, you only go around once in life. So you got to grab for all the gusto you can. You remember that?

I can't even remember which one it was. I mean, maybe it was only on Philadelphia television. I don't know.

You only go around once in life. You got to grab for all the gusto you can. That is the most hopeless possible view of history.

It's hopeless. Why? You're saying is the only happiness you'll ever get is right here because when life is over, you're dead.

And of course, when the sun is over, everything's dead and everything will go up and flames. You cannot possibly expect to keep promises if you believe your life is an accident and eventually everything is going to burn up in the death of the sun. Why in the world would you keep a promise?

The very nature of promise keeping is delayed gratification. Why in the world would you delay your gratification if this life is all there is? Jesus says, don't you understand?

You keep take a make a promise and you lose your job. You make a promise and you get promoted. But I've been charged.

Everything will be even doubt. It is only temporary that sometimes the promise keeping brings you down. I am the judge way according to promise.

That's the first promise. Secondly, and most importantly, his promise to die. His promise to die.

You heard what I said. If you were here one week when the folks joined the church all the way through the Bible again and again and again. God says, if you are faithful to me, I'll be faithful to you.

If you are committed to me, I'll be committed to you again and again and again. Something happened on the cross that never happened before and will never happen again. Someone Jesus Christ went to the cross and against all of the powers of darkness and against all of his own feelings.

He shrank at the possibility of going to the cross. You know why he had a human nature? In the garden, he said, not my will, but thine be done.

You know what he meant? Even though he was a perfect human being, he still was a human being. His divine nature knew exactly where he should go, but his human nature was scared to death.

He was afraid of dying. He knew what he was going to go through. He knew the torment.

How did he keep his human and divine nature together? With a promise, he said, not my will, but thine be done. I've bound myself to the program.

I'm going to do it. He was a person of integrity because he stuck with a promise. Hebrews 10 says that when Jesus came into the world, he says, low, it is written of me in the book.

I come to do the I will. I come to offer myself a sacrifice. He remembers the promise.

That's how he gets to the cross, but on the cross, he says, my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Now wait a minute. What's going on?

How could that possibly be? God always says, if you break promises, you'll be alone. But if you make promises, you'll find people around you.

If you break a promise to me, you're separated from me. But if you make a promise to me, if you keep a promise to me, then I will be with you. But now look what happens.

Here's the first time in the history of the world, and the only time it'll ever happen, that God said that Jesus Christ, if you keep my promise, if you keep this promise to me, I will forsake you. And on the cross, Jesus was absolutely and utterly alone. Do you know why?

We're told in Leviticus 16, on the day of Atonement, once a year, that people of Israel would do something about the fact they've been breaking their promises all year. Every year you break promises to God. You say, I'm going to love my neighbor with myself.

Nobody does that. You say, I'm going to love you and obey you. Nobody does that.

So once a year, they have the day of Atonement, and you know what they did on the day of Atonement? Listen, once a year, the high priest would take a live goat. This is Leviticus 16, and lay both hands on the head of a live goat and confess over all the wickedness and rebellion, all the covenant breaking, all the promise breaking of the Israelites.

And he would put them on the goat's head, and he shall send the goat away into the desert. And the goat will carry on itself all their sins into a solitary place. You know why?

The goat is being treated as the promise breaker. Promise breakers go out. Promise breakers are on the outside.

Promise breakers are in the desert. Promise breakers are utterly alone. And on the cross, Jesus became that scapegoat.

And that's why the writer of the Hebrews in chapter 13 actually says it wasn't an accident where Jesus was crucified. He suffered outside the gate that he might redeem us with his blood. Jesus Christ was such a promise breaker that he was willing, he was such a promise keeper.

He was willing to go to the cross. But now here's what's so weird. He was such a promise keeper that he was willing to be treated as the ultimate promise breaker so that you and I could become promise keepers.

He was sent out. He says, my God, my God, you forsaken me. I'm alone in the dark.

There is nothing between me and the fire of your utter rejection. It's pouring out into the core of my being. Why is it being treated like that?

He's being treated as a promise breaker. You know what's so weird? Here's Peter warming himself with the fire in the courtyard.

Here's Jesus tortured. Why? Jesus is the promise breaker.

Peter is the promise breaker. Peter is being substituted for. Jesus is taking the curse that belongs to Peter and you and I are Peter.

Do you see it? Now, find your friends unless you see, and this brings us to the end, the third thing you have to see is Jesus then is able to come to Peter at that fire and he's able to say, Peter, do you love me? Three times.

And Peter repents because he has to say, I love you three times to kind of make up for the denial. And then what does he say? Jesus says, in that case, you can still be a leader of mine.

You can still be a leader. I'm going to put you back in charge. What?

How? You say, if promise breaking is so bad and promise keeping is so important, how can he do that? Because Jesus says now, don't you say, Peter, what you did wrong the first time?

You think that your identity is really bound up in your promise keeping. I'll know a Christian's identity comes from Jesus' promise keeping. If you think you can save yourself through promise keeping, you'll be a promise breaker just like Peter.

Peter felt he could save himself by being a really committed person. And so he picked it up in fear and pride. And because he picked it up in fear and pride, when he saw his weakness, he was in despair.

But a Christian, here's what's so ironic, if you understand that you are not saved by your promise keeping, but by Jesus' promise keeping. When you pick up a promise, you will break it. You're a sinner, but when you break it, you won't be able to deny it.

You repent. And a repentant promise breaker is a promise keeper. You won't be in despair.

Your identity will not fall apart because you'll say, he forgives. He loves me not because I have been the promise keeper, but because he was the promise keeper. And because of that, here's the great irony, here's the paradox.

When you break a promise and you know you're a sinner saved by grace, you can repent quickly and that brings you right back into where you were before. You don't make excuses. You're not denying and you're back in promise keeping.

The people who best keep their promises to God are the people who know they can't. The people who best keep their promises to God and grow are the people who know that they are loved, not because they're promise keepers, because Jesus is. You know where that leaves you?

Some of you are afraid to make promises. That's why you're in New York. That's why some of you won't even date.

That's why some of you don't have many friends. That's why some of you don't lay yourself out into people's lives. That's why some of you never join a church.

You're afraid of commitment. Don't you see? He's the judge.

Don't be scared. And he died. He took your penalty.

He was willing to keep a promise like that. Why can't you keep promises for him? On the other hand, some of you by the way are too quick to make promises.

That's just as bad. You know why? You can see now that if you're too quick to make promises, and you make so many promises, you find they contradict each other.

You promise this personist and this personist, this personist, and then you can't actually come up with it and you have to back out and you have to repent. Don't you see? Promise keeping is so important that those of you who are afraid to make them need to start making more committed.

But promise keeping is so important that some of you who over-promise and who over-commit you need to start pulling back because promise keeping is a divine thing. You're just a little lower than God when you make promises and you make covenants and you mustn't do them so quickly. Almost everybody in this room goes one way or the other.

But most of all, if right now you're thinking about doing something disobedient. You made a promise to God. I'm not going to lie.

I'm going to be faithful to my spouse. You know, I'm going to stay chased till marriage. You know, whatever, you make promises based on law of God right now if you're afraid that you're about to pull out.

Oh, gee, look at what it cost him to keep his promise for you and when he did, he was blasted. Now, what's it going to cost you to keep your promise for him? Nothing like it.

Nothing like it. God says to Jesus, if you keep your promise for me, I'll abandon you. But you know what he says to you?

He says, if you keep that promise, even though it'll be hard, if you tell that truth, if you do that right thing, if you keep that promise, I'll be with you. I'll envelop you. I'll descend on you.

It's the exact opposite of what he said to Jesus, but Jesus kept his promise for you. Can't you keep your promise for him? In Jesus Christ, all the promises of God are yay and amen.

Let's be like him. Let's pray. We father, we ask that you'd grant to us now the possibility.

People, men and women of integrity, men and women who are not too quick but not too slow to make commitments and to do so because your son did. Make us people of our word, make us people of honesty, let the world look in that this community and be amazed at the truth spoken in love here, at the promises made to commitment. The way people give their money, the way people give their time, the way people give their hearts, people who are not afraid to be committed to one another.

Make us people like that because we're seeing your son, the great promise keeper in Jesus' name will pray. Amen. Thanks for joining us here on the Gospel Unliked Podcast.

他看到耶稣是一位信守承诺的人。而不是看着自己，而不是说，我能做到。你知道，意志力。

我能做出承诺。我能做到。我知道我能。

而不是从意志力中汲取力量并看着自己，他看到耶稣是一位信守承诺的人。他看到耶稣做出的三个承诺。我对你说，除非你看到同样的三个承诺，你永远不会成为一个信守承诺的人。

你不能。你会太害怕做出承诺，就像你们那些被伤害过的人一样，你会太软弱而无法信守承诺。你会太害怕做出它们。你会太软弱而无法信守它们。

因此，你会发现更少的身份和更少的共同体。除非你看到耶稣做出的这三个承诺，彼得看到了它们，它永远改变了他。他从自己转向耶稣这位信守承诺的人。

那三个是什么？好吧，让我提一下它们。耶稣应许审判。

耶稣应许去死。耶稣应许饶恕。我们必须拥有它们所有。

我只是要列举它们。第一，他审判的应许。耶稣基督说："彼得，我掌权。"

"你活，你死，你死，你活。你不明白吗？我掌权。"

"我是全地的审判者。即使你们中的一些人可能因信守承诺而遭受可怕的痛苦，你知道，这里，让我们看一个承诺，你作为基督徒应该做出的承诺，总是说真话。某人，你知道，这里有一个人说真话，老板说，我不喜欢它，但你有勇气。"

"你被提升了。"所以这里有另一个基督徒。这个基督徒说："好的，我知道我是基督徒。"

"我要说真话。我知道一件事。我说真话。"

老板说："我不喜欢它。你被解雇了。"对吧？

"等一下，"彼得说，"你知道，为什么我信守承诺会被杀，而约翰信守承诺会活下来？为什么？"耶稣说："你不明白吗？"

"我是审判者。到最后，一切都会被摆正。没有人会逃脱任何事。"

"听着，朋友们，除非你有一个理解，一个对历史和未来充满希望的观点，除非你明白有一位神，无论信守承诺在短期内让你付出什么代价，到最后，真理、公义、怜悯、正义和良善，你所持守的事物和你做出承诺时所基于的事物，当你向神做出承诺时，说，这些事物是终极现实。在这个世界上，有时这些事情意味着你会吃亏，但我们知道这个世界不是唯一的世界。我们知道有一个更大的世界。"

"我们知道，这就是为什么彼得能够说，在彼得后书第3章，我们按照应许等候，因为我们知道他将要审判，正义、真实、公正、怜悯、爱和良善，我们所基于的生命的事物，这些都是终极现实。它们将胜利，因此我们这些持守它们的人，我们也将胜利。如果你不明白这一点，信守承诺有什么用呢？"

换一种方式说。记得那些婴儿潮一代吗？你还记得这个足够老吗？记得这个广告吗？

有一个啤酒广告曾经说："你在生活中只走一次。所以你要尽可能地抓住所有的乐趣。"你记得吗？

我甚至不记得是哪一个了。我的意思是，也许它只在费城电视上播出。我不知道。

"你在生活中只走一次。你要尽可能地抓住所有的乐趣。"这是对历史最绝望的看法。

这是绝望的。为什么？你在说的是，你能得到的唯一快乐就在这里，因为当生命结束时，你就死了。

当然，当太阳结束时，一切都死了，一切都会燃烧起来。如果你相信你的生命是一个意外，最终一切都会在太阳的死亡中燃烧殆尽，你不可能期望信守承诺。为什么你会信守承诺？

信守承诺的本质就是延迟满足。如果这一生就是全部，为什么你要延迟你的满足？耶稣说："你不明白吗？"

"你冒险做出承诺，你失去了工作。你做出承诺，你得到晋升。但我一直负责。"

"一切都会平衡。只是暂时的，有时信守承诺会让你倒下。我是审判者，我们按照应许等候。"

这是第一个承诺。其次，也是最重要的，他去死的承诺。他去死的承诺。

你听到我说的了。如果你在一周前在这里，当人们加入教会时，贯穿整本圣经，一次又一次又一次。神说："如果你对我忠诚，我就对你忠诚。"

"如果你委身于我，我就委身于你，"一次又一次又一次。在十字架上发生了一些以前从未发生过、以后也永远不会再发生的事情。有人，耶稣基督走向十字架，对抗所有黑暗的力量，对抗他自己所有的感受。

他在走向十字架的可能性面前退缩了。你知道他为什么有人性吗？在客西马尼园，他说："不要照我的意思，只要照你的意思。"

你知道他是什么意思吗？即使他是一个完美的人，他仍然是一个人。他的神性确切地知道他应该去哪里，但他的人性吓得要死。

他害怕死亡。他知道他将要经历什么。他知道那种折磨。

他如何使他的人性和神性保持一致？通过一个承诺，他说："不要照我的意思，只要照你的意思。我已经把自己绑在了这个计划上。"

"我要去做。"他是一个有诚信的人，因为他坚持了一个承诺。希伯来书第10章说，当耶稣来到世界时，他说："看哪，经上记着我的事，我来了。"

"我来要照你的旨意行。我来献上自己为祭。"他记得那个承诺。

这就是他如何到达十字架的，但在十字架上，他说："我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？"现在等一下。发生了什么事？

这怎么可能？神总是说："如果你违背承诺，你会孤独。但如果你做出承诺，你会发现人们围绕着你。"

"如果你对我违背承诺，你就与我分离。但如果你对我做出承诺，如果你对我信守承诺，那么我就会与你同在。"但现在看发生了什么。

这是世界历史上第一次，也是唯一一次会发生的事，神说耶稣基督："如果你向我信守承诺，如果你信守这个对我的承诺，我将离弃你。"在十字架上，耶稣绝对完全孤独。你知道为什么吗？

我们在利未记第16章被告知，在赎罪日，每年一次，以色列人会对他们一整年违背承诺的事实做些什么。每年你都违背对神的承诺。你说："我要爱邻舍如同自己。"

没有人那样做。你说："我要爱你、顺服你。"没有人那样做。

所以每年一次，他们有赎罪日，你知道他们在赎罪日做什么吗？听着，每年一次，大祭司会带一只活山羊。这是利未记第16章，按手在活山羊的头上，承认以色列人一切的罪恶和悖逆，一切违背约定、违背承诺的行为。

他会把它们放在山羊的头上，他要把山羊送到旷野去。山羊要担当他们一切的罪孽，到无人之地。你知道为什么吗？

山羊被当作违背承诺者对待。违背承诺的人出去。违背承诺的人在外面。

违背承诺的人在旷野。违背承诺的人完全孤独。在十字架上，耶稣成了那只替罪羊。

这就是为什么希伯来书的作者在第13章实际上说，耶稣在哪里被钉十字架不是偶然的。他在城门外受苦，为要用他的血救赎我们。耶稣基督是这样一个违背承诺的人，他愿意，他是这样一个信守承诺的人。

他愿意走向十字架。但现在这就是如此奇怪的地方。他是如此信守承诺，以至于他愿意被当作终极的违背承诺者对待，这样你和我就能成为信守承诺的人。

他被送出去。他说："我的神，我的神，你离弃了我。我在黑暗中孤独。"

"在我和你彻底拒绝的烈火之间什么都没有。它正倾泻进我生命的核心。"为什么他被这样对待？

他被当作违背承诺的人对待。你知道什么如此奇怪吗？这里是彼得在院子里的火边取暖。

这里是耶稣被折磨。为什么？耶稣是违背承诺的人。

彼得是违背承诺的人。彼得被替代了。耶稣承受了属于彼得的咒诅，你和我就是彼得。

你明白了吗？现在，找到你的朋友，除非你看到，这把我们带到最后，你必须看到的第三件事是，耶稣然后能够在那个火边来到彼得面前，他能够说："彼得，你爱我吗？"三次。

彼得悔改，因为他必须说三次"我爱你"，以某种方式弥补那次否认。然后他说什么？耶稣说："在那种情况下，你仍然可以成为我的领袖。"

"你仍然可以成为领袖。我要让你重新负责。"什么？

怎么回事？你说，如果违背承诺如此糟糕，信守承诺如此重要，他怎么能那样做？因为耶稣说："现在，你不说吗，彼得，你第一次做错了什么？"

"你认为你的身份真的与你信守承诺有关。我会知道基督徒的身份来自耶稣信守承诺。如果你认为你可以通过信守承诺来拯救自己，你就会成为一个违背承诺的人，就像彼得一样。"

彼得觉得他可以通过成为一个真正委身的人来拯救自己。所以他在恐惧和骄傲中接受它。因为他在恐惧和骄傲中接受它，当他看到自己的软弱时，他陷入了绝望。

但一个基督徒，这就是如此讽刺的地方，如果你明白你不是被你信守承诺拯救，而是被耶稣信守承诺拯救。当你拿起一个承诺时，你会违背它。你是个罪人，但当你违背它时，你不能否认它。

你悔改。一个悔改的违背承诺者是一个信守承诺的人。你不会绝望。

你的身份不会崩溃，因为你会说，他饶恕。他爱我不是因为我一直是信守承诺的人，而是因为他是信守承诺的人。正因为如此，这就是伟大的讽刺，这就是悖论。

当你违背承诺，你知道你是一个因恩典得救的罪人，你可以迅速悔改，这会把你带回你之前的位置。你不会找借口。你不会否认，你就回到信守承诺中。

最能信守对神的承诺的人是那些知道他们做不到的人。最能信守对神的承诺并成长的人是那些知道他们被爱不是因为他们是信守承诺的人，而是因为耶稣是的人。你知道这让你处于什么位置吗？

你们有些人害怕做出承诺。这就是你在纽约的原因。这就是为什么你们有些人甚至不约会。

这就是为什么你们有些人没有很多朋友。这就是为什么你们有些人不把自己投入到人们的生活中。这就是为什么你们有些人从不加入教会。

你害怕委身。你不明白吗？他是审判者。

不要害怕。他死了。他承受了你的刑罚。

他愿意信守像那样的承诺。你为什么不能为他信守承诺？另一方面，顺便说一下，你们有些人太快做出承诺。

那同样糟糕。你知道为什么吗？你现在可以看到，如果你太快做出承诺，你做了这么多承诺，你发现它们彼此矛盾。

你向这个人承诺这个，向这个人承诺这个，向这个人承诺这个，然后你实际上无法兑现，你必须退出，你必须悔改。你不明白吗？信守承诺如此重要，以至于你们那些害怕做出承诺的人需要开始更多地委身。

但信守承诺如此重要，以至于你们有些人过度承诺、过度委身的人需要开始退后，因为信守承诺是一件神圣的事。当你做出承诺、制定约定时，你只比神低一点，你不能如此轻率地这样做。这个房间里几乎每个人都走一条路或另一条路。

但最重要的是，如果现在你正在考虑做一些不顺服的事。你向神做出了承诺。我不会撒谎。

我要对我的配偶忠诚。你知道，我要在婚姻前保持贞洁。你知道，无论如何，你基于神的律法做出承诺，现在如果你害怕你要退出。

哦，天哪，看看他为你信守承诺付出了什么代价，当他这样做时，他被击打了。现在，你为他信守承诺要花费你什么？不像那样。

不像那样。神对耶稣说："如果你为我信守承诺，我会离弃你。"但你知道他对你说什么吗？

他说："如果你信守那个承诺，即使它会很难，如果你说那个真话，如果你做那个正确的事，如果你信守那个承诺，我会与你同在。我会包围你。我会降临在你身上。"

这与他对耶稣说的完全相反，但耶稣为你信守了他的承诺。你不能为他信守你的承诺吗？在耶稣基督里，神的一切应许都是"是的"和"阿们"。

让我们像他一样。让我们祷告。我们的父，我们祈求你现在赐给我们这个可能性。

人们，有诚信的男人和女人，不太快但也不太慢做出承诺的男人和女人，这样做是因为你的儿子做了。使我们成为信守诺言的人，使我们成为诚实的人，让世界看这个群体，对这里在爱中说出的真理、做出的承诺和委身感到惊讶。人们给出他们的金钱、他们的时间、他们的心的方式，那些不害怕彼此委身的人。

使我们成为那样的人，因为我们看到你的儿子，这位伟大的信守承诺者，奉耶稣的名祷告。阿们。感谢你在"生命中的福音"播客上与我们一起。
