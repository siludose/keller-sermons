## 祷告的真正目的不是向神索取 / The True Purpose of Prayer Is Not to Get Things from God

Welcome to Gospel in Life. What is holding you back from truly trusting in God?

From not just believing in His existence, but letting the power of His Word change how you approach daily life, work, and relationships. In today's message, Tim Keller looks at one of Jesus' most well-known teachings to explain how true faith begins when we stop trying to control our own lives and start trusting in the God who knows exactly what we need. This then is how you should pray. Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.

And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins. This ends the reading of God's Holy Word. Thank you. Today we look at the last aspect of the Lord's Prayer. This is the fourth week we've been looking at it.

And today we're going to talk about how God answers prayer. And to many people, this is the whole point of prayer. The whole point of prayer is, how do you get God to give you things?

How do you make application for your needs? In a place like New York, we're so used to applications. All sorts of application procedures, very lengthy. And all sorts of audition procedures.

And so we say, all right, prayer is one. How do I do it?

How do I get God? Isn't that the main point?

How do I get God to give me what I need? Now, I hope up to now that you have realized that we have made clear that that's not the point of prayer. The point of prayer is not at all to get God to give you what you need. And if you think that is the main point of prayer, you will get very little.

That's the irony of prayer. Prayer is very effective for those people who don't come into it hoping that it will necessarily be primarily a way that you get God to give you things. The prayer of a righteous man availeth much. And the prayer of a person who is not out necessarily to use prayer to get God to give me things, that's not the point. We've said the point of prayer is to get the heart back into its true orbit. To center on God, to worship and glorify and center on God, that's what prayer is. And we've said, for example, if the moon would leave its true orbit, it would begin to crash and burn and hit things.

And therefore, if the heart leaves its true orbit of centering everything on God, the same thing happens only spiritually and cosmically. We crash and we burn. And we said that, therefore, in prayer, we make God central again.

今天我们要谈的是神如何回应祷告。对于很多人来说，这就是祷告的全部意义。祷告的全部意义就是——你怎样才能让神给你东西？

你怎样为自己的需要提出申请呢？在纽约这样的地方，我们太习惯各种申请了。各种各样的申请程序，非常冗长。各种各样的面试流程。

所以我们就说，好吧，祷告就是一种申请。我该怎么做？

我怎样才能打动神？这难道不是最关键的问题吗？

我怎样才能让神给我我所需要的？我希望到目前为止，你们已经认识到，我们已经清楚地阐明了——那不是祷告的意义。祷告的意义根本不是让神给你你所需要的。如果你认为那是祷告的主要目的，你将所获甚微。

这就是祷告的吊诡之处。祷告对于那些不把它当作向神索取手段的人来说，是非常有效的。义人的祈祷大有功效。那些不以利用祷告来从神那里获取东西为目的的人，他们的祷告才是有功效的——因为那本来就不是祷告的意义。我们说过，祷告的意义是让心灵回到它真正的轨道上。以神为中心，敬拜、荣耀、聚焦于神——这才是祷告。我们说过，比如，如果月亮离开了它真正的轨道，它就会开始坠落、燃烧、撞上其他东西。

因此，如果心灵离开了以神为万事中心的真正轨道，同样的事情就会发生——只不过是在属灵和宇宙性的层面上。我们会坠落，我们会燃烧。我们说过，所以，在祷告中，我们重新使神成为中心。

这就是祷告的意义。当我们说祷告的意义是让我们回到真正的轨道时，我们并不是说在祷告中我们只是口头上肯定神是中心，或者只是说一句神是中心。而是在祷告中，你真正地使他成为中心。

这是祷告中艰难的功课。换句话说，举个例子，在祷告中，首先，你在思想上使他成为中心——通过回忆和纪念他是谁、他做了什么。然后你使他成为中心。你在感受上使他成为中心——通过欢喜快乐，从他的所是和他的所为中汲取甘甜。

最后，你开始在规划上使他成为中心——根据他是谁、他做了什么，重新审视你对自己所有问题和需要的理解。听到了吗？

你所做的最后一件事，就是开始重新规划你的人生——根据他是谁、他做了什么，重新思考你所有的需要，你所有的工作，你所有的问题。所以在主祷文中有一个从敬拜赞美开始的运动，我们说过，先是将一切都聚焦于神。

## 先接受再祈求的祷告次序 / Accept First, Then Ask: The Order of Prayer

That's the point of prayer. When we say the point of prayer is to return us to our true orbit, we do not mean that in prayer we simply affirm that God is central or we just say that God is central. But in prayer, you actually make him central.

That's the hard work of prayer. In other words, for example, in prayer, first of all, you make him central in your thinking by recollecting and remembering who he is and what he's done. And then you make him central. You make him central in your feeling by rejoicing and drawing the sweetness out of what he is and what he's done.

And then lastly, you begin to make him central in your planning by rethinking all of your understanding about your problems and your needs in light of who he is and what he's done. Hear that?

The last thing you do is you begin to plan your life out by rethinking all about your needs and all about your work. All about your problems in light of who he is and what he's done. And so there's a movement in the Lord's Prayer from adoration, we've said, and centering everything on God.

And then secondly, we're able to say, give us this day our daily bread. Or put it this way, Jesus says, let me paraphrase, in the Lord's Prayer, after you are done centering your heart and mind on the fatherhood of God and his heavenly power, and then submitting completely to his royal lordship, by saying, thy will be done, then you can go and start asking for your daily bread and for protection and for provision. That's what Jesus is saying. All of the adoration part of the Lord's Prayer comes out to this climax. Thy will be done. And Jesus says, you may not do an end run around that. You may not go to your daily bread.

---

然后，接下来，我们才能说："我们日用的饮食，今日赐给我们。"或者换一种方式来说，让我来意译一下，在主祷文中，耶稣说：当你完成了将你的心思意念聚焦于神的父亲身份和他属天的大能，然后完全顺服于他君王般的主权——说出"愿你的旨意成就"之后，你才可以开始为你的日用饮食、为保护、为供应而祈求。这就是耶稣所说的。主祷文中所有敬拜赞美的部分都指向这个高潮——"愿你的旨意成就"。耶稣说，你不可以绕过它。你不可以直接跳到"我们日用的饮食"。

在你达到这个高潮、能够对神说"我现在顺服于你的主权，顺服于你旨意的一切安排"之前，你不可以开始为你的具体需要祈求。然后你才可以去谈论供应的问题。所以这里有一个次序。这个次序必须被遵守。这个次序必须被尊重，否则你就撕裂了祷告的结构。

先接受——"愿你的旨意成就"。然后祈求。先接受、顺服、在一切事上看见他慈爱的旨意。顺服于他旨意的每一个安排。接受——"愿你的旨意成就"。

然后才是祈求。这就是次序。这就是我们今天要来看的——耶稣基督说你可以怎样向神提出申请。

先接受，后祈求。好，让我们来应用。第一，接受。

## 保罗的祷告：为内在生命祈求 / Paul's Prayers: Praying for the Inner Life

You may not start asking about your specific needs until you've brought all of climax and you're able to say to God, I submit right now to your lordship, and every disposal of your will. Then you may go and talk about the provision. So there's an order here. And the order must be obeyed. The order must be honored, or you rip up the fabric of prayer.

First accepting, thy will be done. Then asking. First accepting, submitting, seeing his loving purposes in everything. Submitting to every disposal of his will. Accepting, thy will be done.

And then asking. And that's the order. And that's how we're going to look at how Jesus Christ says you can make application to God.

First accepting, then asking. Look, let's apply it. Number one, accepting.

What does it mean to pray, thy will be done? You can't get to give us this day our daily bread. You can't get to deliver us from evil. You can't start praying for the things you want and for protection from the things that you fear until you first hit, thy will. thy will be done.

What does it mean to pray that? Well, let me give you two case studies. First case study is Paul. And Paul is a terrific case study. If you look up every place that Paul prays for his friends, you will find something absolutely remarkable. In the book of Philippians, he prays in chapter one. In the book of Colossians, he prays in chapter one.

祷告"愿你的旨意成就"是什么意思？你不能直接跳到"我们日用的饮食，今日赐给我们"。你不能直接跳到"救我们脱离凶恶"。在你先触及"愿你的旨意成就"之前，你不能开始为你想要的东西祈求，也不能为你所惧怕的事情求保护。

祷告"愿你的旨意成就"到底意味着什么？让我给你两个案例研究。第一个案例是保罗。保罗是一个极好的案例。如果你去查看保罗为朋友祷告的每一处经文，你会发现一些绝对令人惊叹的事情。在腓立比书中，他在第一章祷告。在歌罗西书中，他在第一章祷告。

在以弗所书中，他在第一章和第三章祷告。所以你一共有四段祷告。去看看他是怎样为朋友祷告的。你会看到一种意味深长的祷告方式。他的祷告中有一种令人惊讶的缺失——没有为脱离困难祷告，没有为医治祷告，没有为克服问题祷告，没有为幸福快乐祷告。你看不到他为这些事祈求。

相反，他以极其详尽的方式祷告。他祈求属灵的洞察力，祈求对神的宏伟和荣耀有一种压倒性的认识，祈求有一种转化生命的、鲜活的信心。这才是他最渴望他朋友们拥有的。而他略过了所有那些必定存在的其他事情——甚至是正在困扰他们的事情。他连提都不提。为什么？

原因是这样的。我们都执迷于一个观念：我们不快乐的主要原因是我们外在的环境。这是一个预设。这是一个前提。这是一个无意识的假设。

我们不快乐的主要原因是外在的某些条件让我们不快乐。因此，我们变得执迷于改变那些条件——只要那些条件改变了，一切就会好的。但事实并非如此，因为保罗和耶稣——耶稣就在这里，而保罗在他的祷告中——不断地在说，你真正需要的是内在的改变。你最需要的是——你真正的问题是缺乏对神的享受、缺乏对神的爱、缺乏对神的认识。你真正的问题来自内在的状况，而不是外在的条件。

## 认知疗法的属灵启示 / The Spiritual Insight of Cognitive Therapy

In the book of Ephesians, he prays in chapter one and chapter three. So you have four prayers. Go look and see how he prays for his friends. And you will see a subliminal prayer. He prays in a surprising absence of any prayer for relief from troubles, for healing, for overcoming problems, for happiness. You don't see him praying for that.

Instead, he prays in the greatest detail. He prays for spiritual insight and an overwhelming sense of the grandeur and glory of God and a transforming, vivid faith. That's what he wants more than anything else for his friends. And he leaves out all the other things that surely must have been there. Even plaguing them. He doesn't even mention them. Why?

Here's why. We're all obsessed with this idea that the main reason we're unhappy is because of things outside of us. That is a presupposition. That is a premise. That is an unconscious assumption.

That the main reason we are unhappy is because of certain conditions on the outside of us that are making us unhappy. And therefore, we become obsessed with changing those conditions. and everything will be fine if that happens. That's not true, though, because Paul and Jesus, Jesus right here, and Paul in his prayers are constantly saying what you really need is for a change inside. You need above everything else. Your real problem is a lack of enjoying God, a lack of love for God, a lack of understanding God. Your real problems come from an internal condition, not an external condition.

Now, you know, what's interesting to me is that there's a particular school of therapy, of counseling, and some of you, I'm sure, are aware of professionally. You might use it, and some of you may have been used on may have read about it. It's an area called cognitive therapy, and in cognitive therapy, this is a very helpful insight. Cognitive therapy will come to a person and say, the reason that you're unhappy is not because of things outside of you, but because of your response to those things.

你们知道，有一件事让我很感兴趣，有一种特别的治疗学派，一种咨询方法，你们中有些人我相信在专业上有所了解。你们可能使用它，有些人可能被用过这种方法，或者读到过它。这个领域叫做认知疗法。在认知疗法中，有一个非常有帮助的洞见。认知疗法会对一个人说：你不快乐的原因不是因为你外在的环境，而是因为你对那些环境的反应。

比如，一个认知治疗师会跟琼斯先生谈话。琼斯先生说："我得了胃溃疡，我得胃溃疡的原因是我太太。"你坐下来，一个好的认知治疗师会说："难怪你感到如此无助和绝望，因为你改变不了你太太，所以你就得了胃溃疡。"

"但那不是真的，琼斯先生。琼斯先生，我认识另一个人叫史密斯先生。他也说：'我有胃溃疡。'"史密斯先生的太太和你太太一模一样，他的脾气也和你一模一样，所以你们俩和各自的太太之间的矛盾方式完全相同。但是史密斯先生饶恕了他太太，他就没有胃溃疡。

所以认知治疗师会说："你难道看不出来吗？胃溃疡的原因不是你太太，而是你对你太太的反应？胃溃疡的原因不是你的外在环境，而是你内在的反应。"这就是一个好的认知治疗师会做的事，而且它确实相当有效。从某种意义上说，它有点像一个心理技巧，但它是有帮助的。

但这有一个属灵的应用。那只是一面镜子，我认为，只是保罗所说的、耶稣基督在这里所说的一个模糊的映射。他们总是以某种方式为内在祷告，原因是我们也执迷于那些我们认为在外在真正让我们不快乐的东西。

## 六岁孩子与两千万遗产 / A Six-Year-Old and a Twenty-Million-Dollar Inheritance

And so, for example, a cognitive therapist will talk to Mr. Jones, and Mr. Jones says, I have an ulcer, and the reason I have an ulcer is my wife. And you sit down, a good cognitive therapist will say, well, no wonder you feel so helpless and hopeless because you can't change your wife, and that's why you have an ulcer.

But that's not true, Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones, I know another man named Mr. Smith. And he says, I have an ulcer. And Mr.

Smith has a wife just like your wife and has a temperament just like your temperament, and therefore you kind of rub each other wrong all in the same way. But Mr. Smith forgives his wife, and he doesn't have an ulcer.

And so, the cognitive therapist would say, don't you see that the cause of the ulcer is not your wife, but your response to your wife? The cause of the ulcer is not your external circumstance, but your internal response. Now, that's what a good cognitive therapist will do, and it's actually pretty effective. It's a bit of a mental trick in some ways, but it's helpful.

But there's a spiritual application of that. That's a mirror, I think, just a dim reflection of what Paul is saying, what Jesus Christ is saying right here. The reason that they're always praying in a certain way for the inside is because we also are obsessed with what we think is really making us unhappy on the outside.

Paul knows that our real problem is we do not know enough about the glory of God and the high privileges that are ours in Jesus Christ. If you're a Christian, why are you so miserable?

Maybe you're anxious. The reason you're anxious is because you don't know enough about the goodness and power of God. You may know it intellectually, but it's not something that thrills you. It's not something that affects you. It's not something that you're grasping, see?

And Paul knows that it's not that threatening situation that's making you miserable. It's your inability to focus on God or give another example. Why are you depressed?

In every case when I'm depressed, I know it's because there's something I want more, something I value more than the inheritance I have as a Christian. Let me bring this down to earth. Imagine walking up to a child who's six years old and this child's truck is broken. Very important thing in his life. And you come up and he's crying and you say, hey, honey, I have something to tell you.

Let me tell you. I just got this in the mail. Let me tell you, you have just inherited $20 million. An uncle died and left you $20 million. And now look what you've got. Who cares about the truck?

And what does the six-year-old do? The six-year-old say, oh, $20 million. Who cares about the truck?

No, that's not what a six-year-old does. He's a child. A six-year-old doesn't have the cognitive ability to understand that. And all the six-year-old does is say, who cares about $20 million?

---

保罗知道，我们真正的问题在于我们对神的荣耀和我们在耶稣基督里的崇高特权认识得不够。如果你是一个基督徒，你为什么如此痛苦？

也许你很焦虑。你焦虑的原因是因为你对神的良善和大能认识得不够。你可能在理智上知道这些，但它并没有让你激动。它并没有真正触动你。它不是你正在紧紧抓住的东西，明白吗？

保罗知道，让你痛苦的不是那个威胁性的处境，而是你无法聚焦于神。再举一个例子。你为什么抑郁？

每一次当我抑郁的时候，我知道那是因为有些东西我看得比我作为基督徒所拥有的产业更重要、更有价值。让我把这个说得更接地气一些。想象一下，你走向一个六岁的孩子，这个孩子的玩具卡车坏了。这在他的生命中是非常重要的事情。你走过去，他正在哭，你说："嘿，宝贝，我有件事要告诉你。"

"让我告诉你。我刚收到这封信。让我告诉你，你刚刚继承了两千万美元。一个叔叔去世了，给你留了两千万美元。你看你现在拥有的！谁还在乎那个卡车？"

那个六岁的孩子会怎么做？六岁的孩子会说："哦，两千万美元！谁还在乎卡车？"

不，六岁的孩子不会这样做。他还是个孩子。一个六岁的孩子没有认知能力去理解这些。六岁的孩子只会说："谁在乎两千万美元？"

"我的卡车没了。我要等到有了新卡车才会开心。"当然，当你看着这个孩子，你知道这个孩子真正的问题不是卡车或缺少卡车。真正的问题是这个孩子没有认识到自己的真实状况。如果他有那种心智能力，如果他有那种认知发展水平，如果他有能力进行形式逻辑运算或者无论需要什么能力，让这个孩子能够领会两千万美元对他意味着什么，这笔钱比那个卡车重要多少——如果他有那些，他就不会有问题了。如果他认识到自己的状况，如果他有一个正确的视角，一个现实的视角，如果他与现实接轨——但一个孩子做不到。

然而，亲爱的朋友们，你们中间有没有人已经接受了基督作为救主，你知道你已经被收纳进入了神的国度，你知道你有份于神的性情，你知道你将来要与他一同作王掌权直到永远——然而你的财务问题或者人际关系问题却正在彻底地、完完全全地摧毁你的幸福。你会说："做基督徒有什么用？"

或者你也许不会在意识层面承认这一点，但在潜意识里，它正在起作用。你的状况与那个六岁的孩子一模一样。我们要这样说：保罗是对的。

耶稣是对的。问题不在于那个财务状况会不会好转，或者那个人际关系会不会好转。问题在于你没有认识到自己的状况。你不知道你是谁，不知道你在他里面拥有什么。

这就是为什么保罗不断地祷告，求神坚固你们里面的人，使你们能够领悟那何等长、何等阔、何等高、何等深的爱，并被神一切的丰盛所充满。保罗知道。耶稣知道。甚至莎士比亚也知道。因为他让凯撒大帝中的角色说："亲爱的布鲁图斯，错不在我们的命运，而在我们自己。"亲爱的布鲁图斯，错不在我们的外在环境。

在你处理好神对你而言意味着什么之前，不要急着跑去说"我们日用的饮食，今日赐给我们"。这就是保罗的案例研究。但让我再给你另一个案例。保罗的祷告是"愿你的旨意成就"的完美范例——先进入神里面，然后，只有在那之后，你才可以开始谈论日用的饮食。

## 客西马尼园：耶稣的顺服 / Gethsemane: Jesus' Submission

I don't have my truck. And I won't be happy until I get a new truck. And of course, when you look at the child, you know that the real problem with a child is not the truck or a lack of a truck. The real problem is this child does not realize his true condition. And if he had the mental apparatus, if he had the cognitive development, if he was capable of the formal logical operations or whatever it takes for that child to be able to grasp what $20 million will mean to him and how much more important it is to him, and how much more important it is to him, than that truck. If he had that, he'd be fine. If he realized his condition, if he had a perspective, a realistic perspective, if he was in touch with reality, but a child is not.

And yet, my dear friends, are there any of you who have received Christ as Savior, and you know you've been adopted into the kingdom, and you know you're a partaker of the divine nature, and you know you're going to rule and reign with him forever, and yet your financial problem or relationship problem is going to be a problem. Is absolutely and utterly destroying your happiness. And you look and say, what good is it to be a Christian?

Or you don't maybe admit that consciously, but unconsciously it's working down there. You are in the exact same condition as that six-year-old child. And we'll say this, Paul was right.

Jesus was right. It's not having that financial thing work out or that relationship thing work out. It's that you don't realize your condition. You don't realize who you are and what you've got in him.

And that's why Paul is constantly praying for your inner man to be strengthened so you may grasp the heights and the width and the breadth and the depth and be filled with all the fullness of God. Paul knows. Jesus knows. Even Shakespeare knew. Because he had Julius Caesar say, the fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars. It's in ourselves. The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our external circumstances.

Don't run off to give us this day our daily bread until you've dealt with the fact of who God is to you. Now, that's Paul's case study, but let me give you another case study. Paul's prayers are a perfect case of praying, thy will be done, praying, get into God, and then, then, and then only can you start talking about daily bread.

Let me give you another case. The ultimate case study of someone who prayed, thy will be done, is who?

Jesus. Remember the context. Remember what happened to Jesus before he prayed, thy will be done.

Jesus Christ was in the Garden of Gethsemane, and what was he facing there? Jesus Christ was facing punishment. He was about to be sacrificed. He was about to be punished for our sin.

What is the punishment for sin in the Bible? What's the Bible always say?

Let me give you just a brief footnote here. 2 Thessalonians 3, verse 8 says, The penalty for sin is very natural. It's to be cut off from God.

But do you know what that means? We were built for God, and we only are able to have any kind of physical and emotional and spiritual coherence if God is supporting us. It's like we have got to have the sun in order for the earth to have any life on here at all. And even when the earth is turned away from the sun, so we don't actually see the sun, we all know that if the sun wasn't there, still supporting us through its power and its radiation, even in the nighttime, even when we can't see it, even when we're not in direct contact with it, we'd still be, we're still being upheld, right, by the sun.

In the same way, even people who are fleeing from God in this life, even people that are living a life of self-mastery, even people that say they don't believe in God, they are being upheld by God. That's what the Bible says. But to be banished from God means that no longer does God give you any support for your humanity or your life. And it means to go into complete and utter darkness. It means to come to the place where you no longer are able to function as a human being. And the illustration is, it's to become totaled as a human being, to be cut off from God. You know, when a car is totaled, it doesn't cease to exist.

It's there, but it can't function any longer as a car. When a human being is totaled, you're still in existence, but you can't love. You can't love. You can't think. You can't experience peace or joy or anything. You can't function. You can't love or receive love.

You're totaled. To be cut off from God, that's what happens. And in the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus began to experience God's rejection that he was going to have to experience for our sake. Substitute for us. Take our punishment. As he sat down and began to pray, he began to taste it. God began to give it to him.

And he began to sweat blood out of his pores. And you know, when he began to sweat blood, that shows us something. Because if the very anticipation and foretaste of this incredible pain and agony was so difficult, if just the foretaste of it was so difficult as to make the eternal Son of God sweat blood out of his pores, what must the actual experience of it have been like?

We don't know. But in the face of that, Jesus Christ looks up to the Father and says, Father, I would like out of this. Father, I'm beginning to taste the cup. I'm in shock. I'm amazed at what this is going to be like. And if there's some way out of it, I want out of it.

But then he immediately says, nevertheless, and it's very clear, that word nevertheless shows that there's a premise that Jesus Christ is operating on. It's something that was already a given. Nevertheless, as we've always had it, not my will, but thine be done. And you know what Jesus is saying?

让我再给你另一个案例。祷告"愿你的旨意成就"的终极案例研究是谁？

是耶稣。记住那个背景。记住在耶稣祷告"愿你的旨意成就"之前，他经历了什么。

耶稣基督在客西马尼园里，他面对的是什么？耶稣基督面对的是刑罚。他即将被献祭。他即将为我们的罪受刑罚。

圣经中罪的刑罚是什么？圣经总是怎么说的？

让我在这里做一个简短的注脚。帖撒罗尼迦后书说：

> "他们要受刑罚，就是永远沉沦，离开主的面和他权能的荣光。"
> ——帖撒罗尼迦后书 1:9

罪的刑罚是非常自然的。就是与神隔绝。

但你知道这意味着什么吗？我们是为神而被造的，只有在神的支撑下，我们才能拥有任何形式的身体、情感和属灵上的完整性。这就像地球必须有太阳才能存在任何生命一样。即使地球转到了背对太阳的一面，我们实际上看不到太阳，我们都知道，如果太阳不在那里，不再通过它的能量和辐射来支撑我们——即使在夜晚，即使我们看不到它，即使我们不与它有直接接触——我们仍然被太阳所托住，对吗？

同样地，即使那些在今生逃离神的人，即使那些过着自我作主生活的人，即使那些说他们不相信神的人，他们都在被神托住。这就是圣经所说的。但是被逐出神的面前意味着——神不再给予你对你的人性或你的生命的任何支撑。这意味着进入完全彻底的黑暗中。这意味着到了一个你再也无法作为一个人来运作的地步。这个比喻就是：作为一个人被彻底报废——与神隔绝。你知道，当一辆车报废的时候，它并没有不存在了。

它还在那里，但它不再能作为一辆车来运作了。当一个人被报废的时候，你仍然存在，但你不能爱了。你不能爱。你不能思考。你不能体验平安或喜乐或任何东西。你无法运作。你不能爱，也不能接受爱。

你被彻底报废了。与神隔绝，就是这样的结局。而在客西马尼园里，耶稣开始体验他将要为我们的缘故所经受的被神弃绝。代替我们。承担我们的刑罚。当他坐下来开始祷告的时候，他开始尝到了那个滋味。神开始将刑罚加在他身上。

他开始从毛孔中流出血汗。你们知道，当他开始流血汗的时候，这向我们显明了一件事。因为如果仅仅是对这难以想象的痛苦和煎熬的预感和初尝就已经如此难以承受，如果仅仅是预尝就已经让神永恒的儿子从毛孔中流出血汗，那真正经历的时候该是何等可怕？

我们不知道。但面对这一切，耶稣基督仰望天父说："父啊，我想要从中出来。父啊，我开始尝到这杯了。我震惊了。这将要来的事远超我的想象。如果有办法避开它，我想避开它。"

但紧接着他立刻说"然而"——很清楚，那个"然而"表明耶稣基督是在一个既定的前提下运作的。这是一个既有的基础。"然而"，正如我们一直所知道的：不是我的意思，而是你的旨意成就。你知道耶稣在说什么吗？

他是在说："父啊，我希望你让我脱离这个。但我也知道，如果这是不可能的，我知道你会从中带出无法估量的祝福和美善。不是我的意思，而是你的旨意成就。"

说"不是我的意思，而是你的旨意成就"，这让耶稣付出了什么代价？这让他付出了什么？

我永远也不会知道。但我确实知道一件事，这才是令人震撼的。在耶稣的情况下，耶稣面对的是超乎想象的恐怖。这个房间里没有任何人会接近那种经历。从来没有任何人类经历过那种境遇。从来没有任何人付出过如此难以置信的昂贵代价，将来也不会有人付出如此难以置信的代价来说出"愿你的旨意成就"。

然而在耶稣的案例中——他付出了最大的代价来说出这句话——这是值得的。去相信吧。这是值得的。因为那几个小时绝对震撼人心、超乎想象的痛苦，带来了一个荣耀的拯救和一个将存到永远的被救赎的新世界。

## 马思逊的诗歌：凡人的顺服 / George Matheson's Hymn: A Mortal's Submission

He's saying, Father, I would like you to get me out of this. But I also know that if it's not possible, I know that you will bring inestimable blessing and goodness out of this. Not my will, but thine be done.

What did it cost Jesus to say, not my will, but thine be done? What did it cost him?

I'll never know. But I do know this, and this is what's staggering. In Jesus' case, Jesus was facing mind-blowing horror. Nobody in this room will ever come anywhere close to that. No human being has ever been anywhere near that. Nobody else ever paid such an incredible dear price, nor ever will pay such an incredible price to say, thine will be done.

And yet in Jesus' case, who paid the greatest price of all to say it, it was worth it. To believe. But it was worth it. Because those several hours of absolutely staggering and mind-blowing pain resulted in a glorious deliverance and a new redeemed world that will last forever.

That's what it cost Jesus Christ to say, thy will be done. Now somebody says, so what?

That's very interesting, and that's very moving, but I'm not Jesus. So if you're trying to tell me I've got to turn around and look at my problems in the face and say, not my will, but thine be done, I'm not Jesus. Well, listen, I know that. And nobody's ever going to ask you to do exactly what Jesus did. I just said that.

But at a much lower level, no one can duplicate what Jesus said, but at a much lower level, you can imitate it. And it is possible. Some years ago, a man named George Matheson, about 100 years ago, a man named George Matheson, a Christian, was about to be married, and while he was engaged, he went blind. Permanently blind. And not only did he have to face a lifetime of darkness, but in the wake of that, his fiancée broke off the engagement.

And so he knew he was now relegated not only to a lifetime of darkness, but a lifetime of loneliness. You'd think one of those or the other of those would be possible, but together, man, that is a crushing burden. What did he do with it?

He wrote a hymn. I printed part of the hymn in the very beginning of the bulletin. But what's so fascinating about the hymn is it shows you an individual, yes, a mortal, who prayed, Thy will be done, in stages. And you can see what it means to pray, Thy will be done. He breaks it down for you.

First of all, he says, I give you back the life I owe. Now, right there, we begin to see one of the big differences between Jesus Christ and me. You know what?

Jesus Christ was the only person who, when he said, Thy will be done, he was the only person who, when he took suffering, didn't deserve it. He's the only one that could have actually said, I don't owe anybody this. You see, when Jesus was sitting there in the Garden of Gethsemane, looking at the cup that he was about to drink, you know what he could have said?

With absolute justice, he could have said, why should I, why should I leave all my glory and love in heaven to come to earth? I take in this burning agony into my breast for these people who don't appreciate what I'm doing, who don't deserve what I'm doing, and will never repay me for what I'm doing?

I don't owe them anything. And he had every right to say that, but instead he turned around and he said, Father, for your sake and for their sake, if you want me to, I'll take the cup. And what happens at this point is that Jesus Christ says, thy will be done when he doesn't owe it.

But none of us are like that. And George Matheson realized that George Matheson was sitting here in blindness, in loneliness, and he said, all I know is this, I better never say I don't deserve what I'm getting. I owe you everything, he says to God. Everything I have that's better than hell is just sheer mercy. Every day, every bird I hear, every day I've got is just your mercy. I owe you everything, so how dare I complain?

And so the first thing George Matheson did to say thy will be done was he reminded himself, if God gave me what I deserved, I'd be a goner.

I give you back the life I owe.

Secondly, he says, all I have to do is find the second one. Then he starts talking about a love that will not let me go. That's amazing.

The second thing he decides to do is after he says, I owe you my life, then the second thing he says is, I am not just knuckling under to your strength. There's a lot of people who think to pray thy will be done simply means, oh, I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. Okay, what choice have I got?

这就是耶稣基督说"愿你的旨意成就"所付出的代价。现在有人会说："那又怎样？"

"这非常有意思，也非常感人，但我不是耶稣。所以如果你想告诉我，我必须转过身来直面我的问题，说'不是我的意思，而是你的旨意成就'——我不是耶稣。"好吧，听着，我知道你不是。没有人会要求你做耶稣所做的事。我刚才已经说了。

但在一个低得多的层次上，没有人能完全复制耶稣所说的，但在一个低得多的层次上，你可以效法他。这是可能的。在若干年前——大约一百年前——有一个名叫乔治·马思逊（George Matheson）的人，一个基督徒，正准备结婚，在订婚期间，他失明了。永久性失明。他不仅要面对一生的黑暗，而且紧随其后，他的未婚妻解除了婚约。

所以他知道他现在面对的不仅是一生的黑暗，还有一生的孤独。你可能觉得这两样中承受一样还可以忍受，但两样加在一起——天哪，这是一个压碎人的重担。他怎么面对的？

他写了一首赞美诗。我在周报的最前面印了这首赞美诗的部分歌词。但这首赞美诗最令人着迷的是，它向你展示了一个人——是的，一个凡人——如何分阶段地祷告"愿你的旨意成就"。你可以看到祷告"愿你的旨意成就"意味着什么。他为你把它拆解开来。

首先，他说："我将所欠的生命归还于你。"就在这里，我们开始看到耶稣基督与我之间的一个重大区别。你知道吗？

耶稣基督是唯一一个在说"愿你的旨意成就"时、在承受苦难时并不配受那苦难的人。他是唯一一个有资格说"我不欠任何人"的人。你看，当耶稣坐在客西马尼园，注视着他即将喝的那杯，你知道他可以说什么吗？

他完全有理由说："为什么我要离开天上一切的荣耀和爱来到地上？我要将这燃烧般的痛苦承受在我胸膛里，为了这些不感恩我所做的、不配得我所做的、永远不会报答我的人？"

"我不欠他们任何东西。"他完全有权这样说。但他反而转过身来说："父啊，为了你的缘故，为了他们的缘故，如果你愿意，我就喝这杯。"在这一刻发生的是，耶稣基督在他不欠任何人的情况下说了"愿你的旨意成就"。

但我们没有人是这样的。乔治·马思逊认识到了这一点。马思逊坐在黑暗中、孤独中，他说："我所知道的是，我永远不能说我不配受到这样的对待。我欠你一切。"他对神说，"我所拥有的一切比地狱好的东西，都完全是恩典。我每一天、我听到的每一声鸟鸣、我活着的每一天，都是你的怜悯。我欠你一切，我怎敢抱怨？"

所以乔治·马思逊说"愿你的旨意成就"所做的第一件事，就是提醒自己：如果神按我应得的给我，我早就完了。

"我将所欠的生命归还于你。"

第二，他说——我只需要找到第二段。然后他开始谈到"那永不松手的爱"。这太惊人了。

他决定做的第二件事是：在他说完"我欠你我的生命"之后，他接着说的是："我不是在屈服于你的力量。"有很多人认为祷告"愿你的旨意成就"只是意味着："好吧，我没有选择。我屈服于你的旨意。我还能怎么办？"

那是无奈的认命。那不是接受。而乔治·马思逊在这里所做的是说："我将你在我生命中所做的一切都视为你慈爱旨意的一部分。我看到你是一位慈爱的神，我看到这是唯一不会弃绝我的爱——即使我失明了，即使我变聋了。无论我遭遇什么，我要将我的人生建立在我所知道的唯一不会消逝的爱之上。"

然后第三，他这样说："我将生命的荣耀置于尘土中死去，从那地面绽放出红色的生命，将存到永远。"他在祷告"愿你的旨意成就"中领悟到的第三件事是，他说："我将生命的荣耀放在尘土中，让它死去。"这是什么意思？

他所说的是：那段感情、那份名声、那些金钱、那种地位、那种受欢迎、那种被认可——所有你拼命想要的、我拼命想要的、他拼命想要的东西——而神似乎正在将它们一一抽走。他所做的是说："不，我不再紧抓住这些东西不放，我把它们放在尘土中。"他说："从那里绽放出红色的生命，将存到永远。"就像耶稣基督一样，乔治·马思逊决定不尖叫、不呐喊，而是说："主啊，如果我不得不放弃这些东西，如果我不得不将这些东西放在尘土中，我所知道的是，不知怎的，你会从中成就一些事——如果我不将它们交给你，那些事就不会发生。不知怎的，如果我把这些东西交给你，你会从中带出奇迹。你会从中带出救赎，就像你在耶稣舍命的时候所做的一样。不知怎的，我知道如果我死了，就会有复活。"

"不知怎的，我意识到，如果我将生命的荣耀放在尘土中，它就会绽放。而且只有在那时它才会绽放。"我对被认可的渴望，我对金钱的渴望，我对受欢迎的渴望，我对这些你似乎正从我脚下抽走的东西的渴望——我说："愿你的旨意成就。"我把它们放下。我把它交给你。

我不再为我的苦难尖叫了。我把我的苦难交给你，我知道你会转化它。在乔治·马思逊的案例中，结果是他拥有了一颗远比从前更深邃、更敏锐、更有爱、更有智慧的心灵——如果没有那些经历，他永远不会拥有这样的心，而这颗心通过服事触动了许多人。那是他的案例。你的案例是什么？

## 苦难会改变你，却不会让你原地不动 / Suffering Will Change You, but It Won't Leave You Where You Are

I knuckle under to your will. Because what else can I do?

That's resignation. That is not acceptance. And what George Matheson does right here is he says, I see everything that you do in my life as part of your loving purposes. I see that you have, you are a loving God, and I see it's the only love that will not reject me, even if I'm blind, even if I go deaf. Even if no matter what happens to me, I will build my life on the only love that I know will last.

And then thirdly, he says this, I lay in the dust life's glory dead, and from the ground there blossoms red life that shall endless be. And the third thing he realizes in praying thy will be done, third thing he does is he says, I'm taking life's glory and I lay it in the dust dead. Now, what does that mean?

What he's talking about is the relationship, the fame, the money, the status, the popularity, the recognition, all the things that you desperately want, that I desperately want, and that he desperately wanted, and that God seemed to be just pulling away. And what he does is he says, no, instead of grabbing onto these things, I lay them in the dust. And he says, there blossoms red life that shall endless be. Like Jesus Christ, George Matheson decided not to scream, and yell, but to say, Lord, if I have to give these things up, if I have to lay these things down in the dust, all I know is that somehow you will work something out of them that would not have happened if I hadn't given them to you. Somehow, if I give these things to you, you'll bring a miracle out of it. You'll bring redemption out of it, like you did out of Jesus when he laid his life down. Somehow, I know that if I die, there'll be a resurrection.

Somehow, I realize that if I lay life's glory down in the dust, it will blossom. And only then will it blossom. My desire for recognition, my desire for the money, my desire for the popularity, my desire for these things that you seem to be pulling out from under me, I say, thy will be done. I lay them down there. I give it to you.

I don't scream anymore about my suffering. I give you my suffering, and I know you'll transform it. And in George Matheson's case, what happened was he became a heart much deeper, much more sensitive, much more loving, much more wise than it ever would have been, and it touched many people through ministry. That was his case. What's your case?

You know, everybody, every one of us, has got these cups. Little cups. They're not like Jesus' cup. Nobody here will be asked to take Jesus' cup and pray thy will be done in front of that.

---

你们知道，每一个人，我们每一个人，都有这些杯。小小的杯。它们不像耶稣的杯。这里没有人会被要求拿起耶稣的杯，面对那杯祷告"愿你的旨意成就"。

但我想知道的是你们如何面对你们的小杯。你们中有些人说得对。朋友们，我的意思是，我得继续讲"祈求"的部分了，我得在这里结束"接受"的部分。朋友们，听着。你们中有些人在说："如果他只告诉我为什么，如果我只知道为什么，那就没问题了。如果我只知道原因。"

难道你看不出来吗？如果你知道了为什么，那就不再是顺服了？那就不再是顺从了？

你知道吗？如果他告诉你为什么，你就会说："哦，我现在明白为什么了。"然后你就会继续前进，你仍然掌控着自己的生活，你仍然是自己的小国王。你生命中的苦难要么会——像乔治·马思逊那样——你可以把它交给神，顺服它，在其中看见他慈爱的旨意，将它交给他。如果你甘心乐意地这样做，苦难会将你塑造成一个远比现在伟大的人；否则，它会把你变成一个远比现在更干瘪、更愤怒、更苦毒、更悲伤的人——但它不会让你保持不变。任何临到你生命中的杯，要么使你成为一个远更伟大的人，要么使你成为一个远更糟糕的人。它不会让你保持不变。你看到你自己处在什么位置了吗？

十字架在基督徒生命中的能力，不是免于苦难，而是拥有十字架在基督徒生命中的大能——将苦难转化为能够改变你、改变你周围所有人的东西，只要你将苦难交给神。如果你说"愿你的旨意成就"——"哦，那永不松手的爱，我将生命的荣耀置于尘土中死去，期待看见它绽放出红色的生命，将存到永远。"

你在祷告"愿你的旨意成就"这件事上做得怎样？你说："我做不到。"那就仰望耶稣。

看看他。他在那里，在最低处。你必须说：看，是耶稣基督——他不配受他所经历的一切——看，在那种情况下，他信靠他至高的父会从中带出美善。如果他能做到，我也能做到。如果他为了我受了那么多的苦，我可以为了他受一点点苦。去找他。说："愿你的旨意成就。"

## 祷告不是被动，而是主动祈求 / Prayer Is Not Passive but Active Asking

But what I want to know is how you're handling your little cups. And some of you are right. My friends here, I mean, I got to move on to asking. I got to get done with accepting here. Friends, listen. Some of you are saying, if he just told me why, if I just knew why, it would be all right. If I just knew that.

And don't you see that if you knew why, it wouldn't be submission anymore? It wouldn't be obedience anymore?

Do you know if he told you why, then you'd say, oh, now I see why. And you would move on 'd stay in control of your life, and you'd stay your own little king. Suffering in your life will either make you, like George Matheson, you can either give it to God, submit to it, see his loving purposes in it, give it to him. Willingly, if you do that, suffering will make you into someone far greater than you are now, or else it will turn you into something far more shriveled and angry and bitter and sad than you are now, but it will not keep you the same. Any cup that comes into your life will either make you a far greater or far worse person. It will not keep you the same. Do you see where you are?

And the power of the cross in the life of the Christian is not exemption from suffering, but the ability to have the power of the cross in the life of the Christian. Have it transformed into something that will change you and change all the people around you if you give God the suffering. If you say, thy will be done, oh, love that will not let me go, I lay in the dust, life's glory dead, and there expect to see it blossom red with life that shall endless be.

How are you doing at praying thy will be done? You say, I can't do it. Well, look at Jesus.

Look at him. He was down there, and you have to say, look, it's Jesus Christ who didn't deserve what he went through, and look, under those circumstances, he trusted his sovereign father to bring good out of it. If it happened to him, I can do it too. If he suffered like that for me, so much, I can suffer my little bit for him. Go to him. Say, thy will be done.

Now, the second thing, as we said, is if you accept, you can go and ask. If you say, thy will be done, you can go and ask. And the Bible, listen, at this point, if you believe that the Lord's prayer is encouraging passivity, you're all wrong.

See, here's Jesus telling you, say, thy will be done. Submit to whatever I give you. And a lot of people would say, hey, that means be passive. Just sit back and say, okay, hit me again. I'm still breathing. You know, Lord, that's what prayer is. You just come and say, Lord, I don't care.

Just do it. It doesn't matter to me. Everything will be fine with me. As soon as you think that Jesus is saying that prayer should be a passive thing, he turns right to you. And says, give us this day our daily bread. That means anything, no matter how basic, no matter how specific, no matter how detailed, be direct. Go after him constantly.

Ask for everything. You see, the Bible teaches, the Bible teaches, God says, if you pray to me, I will give you astonishing things. I will give you mind-numbing things. I will do all kinds of things for you. You've got the place. You've got the promise in Luke where it says, ask and it will be given to you. Seek and you will find.

Knock and it will be opened to you. You've got Isaiah 65. It says, before they ask, I will answer. Before they ask, I will answer.

That's a picture of God like a father running up with a present already in his hand behind his back. Just can't wait for his kid to ask him for something. It's an amazing statement. And what God actually is doing, in the Bible, is he says, prayer is a way to rebel against the status quo.

There's this fascinating place in John chapter 14 where Jesus says this, anyone who has faith in me will do what I am doing and he will do even greater things than these because I am going to the Father and I will do whatever you ask in my name so that the Son may bring glory to the Father. You know what kind of claim that is?

现在，第二件事，正如我们所说的，如果你接受了，你就可以去祈求。如果你说"愿你的旨意成就"，你就可以去祈求。圣经说——听着，在这一点上，如果你认为主祷文是在鼓励消极被动，那你就完全错了。

看，耶稣在这里告诉你：说"愿你的旨意成就"。顺服于我给你的一切。很多人会说："嘿，那意思就是要被动。就是坐在那里说：'好吧，再打我一次，我还在喘气呢。'主啊，祷告就是这样。你来到主面前说：'主，我无所谓。'"

"随便吧。对我来说都一样。一切都会没事的。"当你以为耶稣是在说祷告应该是一件被动的事情时，他立刻转向你，说："我们日用的饮食，今日赐给我们。"这意味着任何事情，无论多么基本、多么具体、多么详细——要直截了当。不断地去找他。

为一切祈求。圣经教导说——圣经教导说——神说：如果你向我祷告，我会给你令人震惊的事情。我会给你超乎想象的事情。我会为你做各种各样的事。你有那个应许。你有路加福音中的应许：

> "你们祈求，就给你们；寻找，就寻见；叩门，就给你们开门。"
> ——路加福音 11:9

你还有以赛亚书六十五章，那里说：

> "他们尚未求告，我就应允；正说话的时候，我就垂听。"
> ——以赛亚书 65:24

这是一幅画面：神像一位父亲，手里已经藏着一份礼物在背后跑过来，迫不及待地等孩子向他开口。这是一个惊人的宣告。神在圣经中实际上在说：祷告是一种向现状宣战的方式。

在约翰福音十四章有一处引人入胜的经文，耶稣这样说：

> "我实实在在地告诉你们，我所做的事，信我的人也要做，并且要做比这更大的事，因为我往父那里去。你们奉我的名无论求什么，我必成就，叫父因儿子得荣耀。"
> ——约翰福音 14:12-13

你知道这是何等大的宣告吗？

他是在说：我要到父那里去，我要坐在至高者的右边，我要开始扩展他的国度。神恨恶压迫和贫穷。神恨恶痛苦和苦难。神恨恶冲突和纷争。我要通过我的能力、我的话语和我的灵来扩展这个国度。而我要扩展这个国度。

我要通过你们的祷告将我国度的能力释放到这个世界中。你看到那些你知道神所恨恶的事情。你看到那些邪恶和罪恶的后果。神的能力——耶稣基督的能力——是通过你们的祷告释放出来的。

## 祷告的保险装置 / The Safety Mechanism of Prayer

He is saying, I'm going to the Father and I'm going to say, I'm going to the Father and I'm going to say, I'm going to the right hand and I'm going to begin to spread his kingdom. God hates oppression and poverty. God hates pain and suffering. God hates conflict and strife. And I'm going to spread the kingdom through my power and my word and my spirit. And I want to spread the kingdom.

I want to release my kingdom power into the world through your prayers. You see things that you know God hates. You see things that are the consequence of evil and sin. God's, Jesus Christ's power is released through your prayers.

That's the setup. However, having said that, you have to remember that this incredible powerful thing called prayer is being put into the hands of children. Our Father who art in heaven, Jesus is teaching us, reminding us that we are children. And whenever you put a weapon like that in the hands of children, any very, very wise father will put on it a safety catch. And you know what?

It's a safety catch. Do you know what the safety catch is?

The safety catch is God will never give you something you ask for that's bad for you. Let me give you an example, another children's example. Why?

Because prayer is a family issue. God, Jesus Christ demands that when you pray, you go to him as father. Imagine that you see a child, you're a parent and you come to see a child and the child wants to start to light some firecrackers. And you say, hey, this is dangerous. I've seen children whose hands have been blown off with firecrackers. We're not going to do it.

But I understand what your problem is. You're bored. And it's a, you know, you don't have anything else to do. And if you just forget the firecrackers, come with me and I can take you someplace that'll be so great.

So much more fun than the firecrackers and safe too. And what does the child say?

I want my firecrackers or I don't want to go anywhere. Now, what's the principle?

Number one, a good parent, when the child is asking for something that is bad for him or her, a good parent will not give the item, but will respond to the need. You see, when the child asks for firecrackers, you realize what the child is really saying is I'm bored. I'm unhappy.

I want to do something. I want to have fun. And so what you say is no, not that honey, but I'm going to give you what you really are after. I'm going to, I will not give you the item, but I will respond to the need.

The Bible promises in a sense that there's no such thing as unanswered prayer. There's places where Jesus says, anything you ask for in my name, I will give to you. How does that jive?

Hebrews chapter five, verse seven says that Jesus Christ poured out his heart to God with strong crying and tears in the garden of Gethsemane. And he was heard for his reverent submission. The first time I read that verse, I said, you're kidding.

What do you mean he was heard? What do you mean he was answered?

It seems to me the garden of Gethsemane, you have a perfect example of unanswered prayer, but there's another sense in which no. No. When you ask for something that's bad for you, what God denies you in kind, he will give you in value. If you ask for a thousand dollars in gold bullion and he gives you a thousand dollars in diamonds, he hasn't really not answered your prayer. And it's absolutely critical to see that if you ask God for something and you ask for the wrong thing, he will not give it to you, but he'll always respond to the need.

And so in that sense, he'll, he'll answer it. And that is very important to see, extremely. See, in some cases, it's easy to see how that works. You know, there was a place in my life in which before I met Kathy, I was wrestling and struggling in prayer, trying to get God to let me marry somebody else. And he turned that down. And it's easy.

That's a simple one. You say, ah, it's so easy to see how the safety catch worked there. It's so easy to see that he was responding to my need, but not giving me the item.

Well, it's not nearly as easy to see in other situations. But that's the point. And that's what the safety catch is. Do you believe that?

以上是大前提。然而，话虽如此，你必须记住，这个被称为祷告的令人难以置信的大能之物，正被交到孩子的手中。"我们在天上的父"——耶稣在教导我们、提醒我们，我们是孩子。每当你把这样一件利器放在孩子手中时，任何一位非常非常智慧的父亲都会在上面安装一个保险装置。你知道吗？

这是一个保险装置。你知道保险装置是什么吗？

保险装置就是：神永远不会给你一样你祈求的、对你有害的东西。让我给你一个例子，另一个关于孩子的例子。为什么？

因为祷告是一个家庭的事。神——耶稣基督要求你祷告时以父亲的身份来到他面前。想象一下，你看到一个孩子——你是一个家长，你来看孩子，孩子想要点鞭炮。你说："嘿，这很危险。我见过孩子的手被鞭炮炸掉。我们不能这样做。"

"但我理解你的问题。你觉得无聊。你没有别的事可做。如果你忘掉鞭炮，跟我来，我可以带你去一个很棒的地方。"

"比鞭炮好玩多了，而且还安全。"孩子会怎么说？

"我要我的鞭炮，不然我哪儿也不去。"那么原则是什么？

第一，一个好的父母，当孩子要求一样对他有害的东西时，好的父母不会给那个物品，但会回应那个需要。你看，当孩子要鞭炮时，你意识到孩子真正在说的是：我无聊了。我不开心。

我想做点什么。我想玩。所以你说："不，宝贝，那个不行，但我要给你真正想要的。我不会给你那个物品，但我会回应你的需要。"

圣经在某种意义上应许了：不存在未蒙应允的祷告。有些地方耶稣说："你们奉我的名无论求什么，我必给你们。"这怎么协调呢？

> "基督在肉体的时候，既大声哀哭，流泪祷告，恳求那能救他免死的主，就因他的虔诚蒙了应允。"
> ——希伯来书 5:7

我第一次读到这节经文的时候，我说："你在开玩笑吧。"

"什么叫他蒙了垂听？什么叫他蒙了应允？"

在我看来，客西马尼园是未蒙应允的祷告的完美例子。但从另一个意义上说——不。不是的。当你祈求一样对你有害的东西时，神在种类上拒绝你的，他会在价值上补偿你。如果你求一千美元的金条，他给了你一千美元的钻石，他其实并没有不回应你的祷告。至关重要的是要看到：如果你向神祈求某样东西，而你求错了，他不会给你那样东西，但他总会回应那个需要。

所以从那个意义上说，他会回应的。这一点非常重要，极其重要。看，在有些情况下，很容易看到这是怎么运作的。你们知道，在我生命中有一段时间，在我遇到凯西之前，我在祷告中挣扎、角力，试图让神允许我娶另一个人。而他拒绝了。事后看来很容易。

那是一个简单的例子。你会说："啊，很容易看到保险装置在那里是怎么运作的。很容易看到他是在回应我的需要，而不是给我那个物品。"

但在其他情况下就没那么容易看出来了。但那正是关键所在。那就是保险装置的作用。你相信吗？

我不知道你来自哪里，我不知道你的处境，但也许就在此刻，你的生活中正在发生这样的事情。为什么神不回应你恳切的祷告？

现在不是正确的时候。也许永远不会是正确的时候。但我告诉你这一点：你是一个孩子。他是父亲。

## 做最亲近父心的孩子 / Being the Child Closest to the Father's Heart

I don't know where you, I don't know where you're coming from, but it may be right now. There's things going on in your life like that. Why doesn't God answer your heartfelt prayer?

This isn't the right time. And it may never be the right time, but I'll tell you this much. You're a child. He's a father.

That's the whole issue of prayer. And I know this, and you know, this, if you've ever been around children, children almost every day ask for things. Almost every hour ask for things that are wrong for them. Almost every hour. It's the nature of being children. And when you say no, they've got two possible things they can do. They're not going to understand.

They don't have the wisdom. They don't have the ability to understand why not. They can either say, all right, all I know is that my dad loves me and that when I obey him, generally it works out.

And so I'll trust him. Or, or the child can say, get angry and stamp off and become cold. And then the father can't even respond to the need.

I want to know right now is what you're doing. How are you responding?

Because I know everybody in this room. I know everybody in this room. You say, you've never met me. You're made of the same stuff I'm made of. And I know you've been disappointed. And I know that there are prayers, even if you're not a believer, even if you don't even know you believe in God, you've prayed and things have been turned down. And I want to know how you're responding.

Are you responding the first way saying, I know he's a father and I trust him. Are you responding the second way?

Don't you see why some of you are not going flat out for God because underneath you're demanding an explanation. And you're saying, until I know why, until I get that explanation, how can anybody expect me to be flat out for God?

But that's insolent. It's unfair. And ultimately it's self-destructive. You know, which kind of children are the closest to the father's heart?

It's the ones who, know their children. It's the ones who don't insist. They know it all. It's the ones who say, Hey, I'm just a kid.

So I'll trust you because they're not kids anymore. They're on their way to adulthood. And there's some, in some situations, you're going to have to say that you're going to have to say, father, thy will father give us this day or daily bread.

---

这就是祷告的全部核心。我知道这一点——你也知道，如果你曾经和孩子相处过——孩子几乎每天都在要求对他们不好的东西。几乎每个小时都在要求对他们不好的东西。几乎每个小时。这就是做孩子的本性。当你说"不"的时候，他们有两种可能的反应。他们不会理解。

他们没有那种智慧。他们没有能力理解为什么不行。他们要么说："好吧，我只知道我爸爸爱我，当我听他的话时，通常结果都不错。"

"所以我信任他。"或者，孩子也可能生气地跺脚走开，变得冷漠。然后父亲连那个需要都无法回应了。

我现在想知道的是你在做什么。你怎样回应？

因为我了解这个房间里的每一个人。我了解这个房间里的每一个人。你说："你从来没见过我。"你跟我是同一种材料做的。我知道你曾经失望过。我知道有些祷告——即使你不是信徒，即使你自己都不知道你相信神——你祷告了，却被拒绝了。我想知道你是怎样回应的。

你是以第一种方式回应，说"我知道他是父亲，我信任他"？还是以第二种方式回应？

你难道看不出来吗？你们中有些人之所以没有全心全意跟随神，是因为在内心深处你们在要求一个解释。你们在说："除非我知道为什么，除非我得到那个解释，否则怎么能指望我全心全意跟随神？"

但那是傲慢的。那是不公平的。而且最终是自我毁灭的。你知道哪种孩子是最贴近父亲的心的吗？

是那些了解自己是孩子的人。是那些不坚持自己什么都知道的人。是那些说"嘿，我只是个孩子"的人。

"所以我信任你。"因为他们不再只是孩子了。他们正在走向成熟。在某些情况下，你将不得不说——你将不得不说："父啊，愿你的旨意成就。父啊，我们日用的饮食，今日赐给我们。"

"但我知道，如果我没有得到我所求的，我不期望得到解释。因为我知道，试图给一个两岁的孩子讲一堂关于电学的课是多么荒唐——而我正试图把他从电插座旁拉开。他无法理解。"

"我无法理解。我放弃要求解释的权利，我信任你。"这就是最贴近父亲的心的那种孩子。

## 雅各的摔跤：唯有降服方能得胜 / Jacob's Wrestling: Only in Surrender Can You Prevail

But I know that if I don't get the item I asked for, I don't expect an explanation because I know how crazy it is to try to give a lecture on electricity. You do a two-year-old is who I'm trying to pull away from the outlet. He can't understand.

I can't understand. I take away my right for an explanation and I trust you. And that's the kind of child that's closest to the father's heart.

Let me close with this little illustration. How do you know if this is, if prayer is going to work in your life?

You see, if you accept, if you say thy will be done, the Bible then says, then go to God and ask for all kinds of things. And God loves to pour out all kinds of stuff on the hearts of people who start thy will be done and then come and say, look at all my needs. God will do all kinds of things. He'll change your life. He'll change the people around you. He releases his power out into history through your prayer. If first you put your heart in this condition of saying, thy will be done.

I'm a child. You're the father. There was an unhappy man named Jacob. We're told about him in the book of Genesis. Jacob wrestled with God all of his life. He was always in conflict with people. Always.

He had a fight with Esau to get his father's love and he didn't get it. He had a fight with his uncle to get the wife he wanted. He had a fight for his career. He was always in conflict. One night, all alone, out in the desert, pitch darkness, a stranger appears and begins to wrestle with Jacob. And they wrestle for hours. And as time goes on, Jacob begins, to realize this is more than just mortal combat.

He begins to realize this is the meaning of his life. He begins to realize that all of his life he's been angry at God. All of his life he has had to, he's felt God has not given him the blessing he deserved. He had a scheme and struggle to get the wife he wanted. He had a scheme and struggle to get the career he wanted. And he still wasn't happy. God never gave him what he deserved.

And now Jacob begins to realize that he begins to suspect that this one that he's wrestling with is the angel of the Lord, God in human form. And he says, incredible, my chance to pin God, my chance to finally get him where he has to give me what I deserve. And so he wrestles with every fiber of his being and more.

And yet just before daybreak, all of a sudden, the stranger shows who he really is. And he also shows how much strength he's really got.

He reaches over and just touches Jacob's thigh, and his entire leg immediately is paralyzed and goes totally lame. That's the kind of power that obviously the stranger had been repressing, this incredible power. And the battle's over, and Jacob realizes he lost, and all of a sudden something happens and snaps in Jacob, and his life turns around. He begins to realize that his approach is doomed. He'd been trying to demand God, give me what I deserve. He'd been trying to wrestle with God out of strength, and suddenly he realized that would never work, and he changes. He turns around and he says, if I cannot prevail through strength, I'll prevail through weakness.

So lame, hurting, blinded by tears, he holds on to God, and he won't let him go. And the day's coming up. The dawn is coming, and the stranger turns and says, let me go. It's almost daybreak, and you cannot see my face. The stranger and Jacob know that nobody can look on the face of God and live. And Jacob says, I don't care. I won't let you go until you bless me.

And you know what Jacob wanted. What is the blessing?

The Lord bless you and keep you. The Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious unto you. And what Jacob was saying is, I just want you. I just want to see your face. I just want you. And God looks at him and says, you've been called Jacob up to now, but now you'll be called Israel. Because you wrestled with God and man, and you overcame.

You triumphed. And that's incredible. What happened was, Jacob was born again at that moment. Because Jacob finally realized, after all this time, that the only way to win was to surrender. To say, thy will be done, and to say, all I want is you. The moment that Jacob discovered what I hope you will discover, and that is, God is his own happy ending. God is the answer to all the prayers.

To say, all I want is you. All I want is your presence. All I want is a relationship with you, and everything else I can handle. And the minute that Jacob lost, he won. The minute he surrendered, he finally triumphed. Finally, God turned and says, Jacob, I've been waiting for this for a long time. And it was only through his gentle wrestling.

That God actually accomplished it in Jacob's life. And you know, the reason that can happen to you and me, is because Jesus Christ was our real champion. And he went off and wrestled with our real problem. And it wasn't us, and it wasn't God. The real problem is sin and evil. And Jesus Christ triumphed on the cross because, like Jacob, he lost. He submitted to the Father.

He said, thy will be done. And in that loss, in that weakness, he triumphed. And he took the punishment for our sin. Justice was satisfied. We could be saved. Do you know the power of prayer?

The power of prayer is that if you would begin to pray the way Jesus says so, there could be all kinds of things going on in your life. Tremendous things happening in your life. What's holding you back?

Thomas Watson says, Jesus Christ more readily went ad crucem to the cross than we go to the throne of grace. Go to him. But secondly, do you know the sweet helplessness?

Do you know what it's like to say, thy will be done? All I care for is to see your face. Some of you are walking lame, and you still don't get it, do you?

What Jesus Christ is saying is, I love you. Surrender to me. Lay down your arms. Humble yourself under my mighty hand, and you'll be exalted. The way to up is down. The way to be free is to submit. The way to power is to serve.

让我以这个小故事来结束。你怎么知道祷告是否会在你的生命中产生果效？

你看，如果你接受了，如果你说"愿你的旨意成就"，圣经然后说：去找神，为各种各样的事情祈求。神喜欢将各种各样的好处倾倒在那些先说"愿你的旨意成就"、然后来到他面前说"请看我所有的需要"的人心中。神会做各种各样的事情。他会改变你的生命。他会改变你周围的人。他通过你的祷告将他的大能释放进入历史之中。前提是你首先将你的心放在这样一个状态中——说："愿你的旨意成就。"

"我是孩子。你是父亲。"有一个不快乐的人名叫雅各。我们在创世记中读到关于他的事。雅各一生都在与神角力。他总是与人冲突。总是如此。

他与以扫争夺父亲的爱却没有得到。他与舅舅争夺他想要的妻子。他为他的事业争斗。他总是处于冲突之中。一天夜里，独自一人在旷野中，一片漆黑，一个陌生人出现了，开始与雅各摔跤。他们摔跤了数个小时。随着时间推移，雅各开始意识到这不仅仅是一场凡人的搏斗。

他开始意识到这关乎他生命的意义。他开始意识到他一辈子都在对神生气。他一辈子都觉得神没有给他应得的祝福。他不得不费尽心机去得到他想要的妻子。他不得不费尽心机去得到他想要的事业。而他仍然不快乐。神从来没有给他他应得的。

现在雅各开始意识到——他开始怀疑——他正在与之摔跤的这位就是耶和华的使者，以人形出现的神。他说："难以置信，这是我制服神的机会，这是我终于可以逼他给我应得之物的机会。"于是他用尽每一根纤维的力量去摔跤，甚至超越了自己的极限。

然而就在黎明之前，突然间，那位陌生人显示出了他的真实身份。他也显示出了他真正拥有多大的力量。

他伸手只是轻轻一摸雅各的大腿，他整条腿立刻就瘫痪了，完全瘸了。那种力量显然是陌生人一直在压制着的，这种令人难以置信的大能。战斗结束了，雅各意识到他输了。突然间，雅各内心发生了某种转变，他的人生转向了。他开始意识到他的方式是注定失败的。他一直试图要求神给他他应得的。他一直试图凭着力量与神角力。突然间他意识到那永远行不通。于是他改变了。他转过身来说："如果我不能靠力量取胜，我就靠软弱取胜。"

于是，瘸着腿，忍着痛，泪眼朦胧，他紧紧抓住神，不肯放手。天快亮了。黎明将至。那位陌生人转身说："天快亮了，你不能看见我的面，放我走吧。"那位陌生人和雅各都知道，没有人能看见神的面而存活。雅各说："我不在乎。你不给我祝福，我就不让你走。"

你知道雅各想要的是什么。那祝福是什么？

> "愿耶和华赐福给你，保护你。愿耶和华使他的脸光照你，赐恩给你。"
> ——民数记 6:24-25

雅各所说的是："我只要你。我只想看见你的面。我只要你。"神看着他说："你从前叫雅各，但从今以后你要叫以色列。因为你与神与人较力，你都得胜了。"

你得胜了。这太不可思议了。那一刻发生的是，雅各在那一刻重生了。因为雅各终于在经过这一切之后意识到，唯一获胜的方式就是降服。说"愿你的旨意成就"，说"我只要你"。那一刻，雅各发现了我盼望你也能发现的——那就是：神本身就是他自己的美好结局。神就是所有祷告的答案。

说"我只要你。我只要你的同在。我只要与你有关系，其他一切我都能应付。"在雅各失败的那一刻，他赢了。在他降服的那一刻，他终于得胜了。最终，神转过身来说："雅各，我等这一刻等了很久了。"正是通过他温柔的摔跤，

神在雅各的生命中成就了这一切。你们知道，同样的事之所以能发生在你我身上，是因为耶稣基督是我们真正的勇士。他去与我们真正的问题角力。那不是我们，也不是神。真正的问题是罪和邪恶。耶稣基督在十字架上得胜了，因为像雅各一样，他"输了"。他顺服了天父。

他说："愿你的旨意成就。"在那个失败中，在那个软弱中，他得胜了。他承担了我们罪的刑罚。公义得到了满足。我们得以被拯救。你知道祷告的能力吗？

祷告的能力在于：如果你开始按照耶稣所说的方式祷告，你的生命中就会发生各种各样的事情。了不起的事情在你的生命中发生。是什么在拦阻你？

汤玛斯·华森说：耶稣基督走向十字架（ad crucem），比我们走向恩典的宝座更加甘心。去找他吧。但第二，你知道那种甘甜的无助吗？

你知道说"愿你的旨意成就"是什么感觉吗？"我所在乎的只是看见你的面。"你们中有些人正瘸着腿走路，但你们仍然不明白，对吗？

耶稣基督所说的是：我爱你。向我降服。放下你的武器。在我大能的手下谦卑自己，你就会被升高。向上的路是向下走。自由之路是顺服。得能力之路是服事。

失去生命的方式就是找到它。找到生命的方式就是失去它。通向冠冕的道路是经过十字架。

## 结束祷告 / Closing Prayer

The way to lose your life is to find it. The way to find your life is to lose it. And the way to the crown is by the cross.

Let's pray. Our Father, all we ask is that you would show us that we cannot take an end run around thy will be done. Teach us to say, thy will be done, so that then you can pour down your all kinds of daily bread on us. That's all we ask. We ask, Father, every single person in this room has little cups that we're just having trouble handling. Every person in this room is struggling to pray thy will be done. For some of us, the moment that we finally pray thy will be done, we will be converted and brought into your family.

And for the first time, we'll receive Christ as Savior. And for the first time, we'll give our lives to you. And for the first time, we'll know you personally.

But for some of the rest of us, we'll know you personally. For the rest of us, we've been Christians a long time, but your grace is being blocked in our lives because we will not say thy will be done. Father, show us, remind us that the way up is down, and the way to find our life is to lose it. In your service, we pray it in Jesus' name. Amen.

让我们祷告。我们的父啊，我们所求的就是你让我们看到，我们不能绕过"愿你的旨意成就"。教导我们说"愿你的旨意成就"，这样你才能将各样的日用饮食倾倒在我们身上。这就是我们所求的。父啊，我们求你——这个房间里的每一个人都有小小的杯，我们在面对它们时挣扎不已。这个房间里的每一个人都在挣扎着祷告"愿你的旨意成就"。对于我们中的一些人来说，当我们终于祷告"愿你的旨意成就"的那一刻，我们就会归信，被带入你的家中。

我们将第一次接受基督为救主。第一次将我们的生命交给你。第一次亲自认识你。

但对于我们其余的人来说，我们将更亲密地认识你。对于我们其余的人来说，我们做基督徒已经很久了，但你的恩典在我们的生命中被拦阻了，因为我们不肯说"愿你的旨意成就"。父啊，让我们看到，提醒我们：向上的路是向下走，找到生命的方式是失去它。奉你的名，我们如此祷告。奉耶稣的名。阿们。
