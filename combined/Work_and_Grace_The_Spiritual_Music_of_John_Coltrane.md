## 上帝之手在艺术中 / The Hand of God in Art

And that, to me, because of the way I believe, is the hand of God. When I hear him play, it's not just the person playing. It's the voice of God screaming out that horn.

I have to say that in listening to music, I've never heard the awesome power of the creators so manifest in an individual ever. I think you'd be hard-pressed to find that kind of depth. Many places else.

I don't know if it exists. Certainly in jazz, I don't know about that. I just know that listening to him, the impact he had on me.

And also, he was tireless in pursuing the development of his gift. He didn't squander his gift. He was given an amazing gift, but he worked harder than anybody.

He was not an early prodigy that came out at age 18 and took the world by storm. He worked and worked and practiced and banged his head against the wall and kept going in a way that it wasn't like he was 18 years old and could do everything. No.

I know guys that grew up with him in Philly asked Jimmy Heath. He remembers him when he was developing. If you ask, I've talked to saxophone players like Benny Goulson who grew up with Train.

He told me the funny story of when he and Coltrane used to play his mom. Benny Goulson's mom used to have him over the house when they played jazz sessions. You'd say, John, there was a Johnny Hodges ballad that Duke Ellington played and he would always make John.

She would make John play that every time he came over. And the story goes that they were in a big band and they were told that the gig got canceled. And then they walked around the community and saw posters up for the gig that they were fired from but was still happening.

And they went home to Benny Goulson's mom and they had their heads low. And she said, what's wrong, boys? She said, well, that job that we thought we were planning is happening and we're not on it.

She said, I don't worry. One day people are going to pay a lot of money to hear you play. They fast forward about 20 years later at the Monterey Jazz Festival or the Newport Festival.

And of course, Benny Goulson was playing with Art Blakey. His tunes were all over the place. Train had his quartet and they were backstage and Train started laughing.

And then he said, what's so funny? He said, remember what your mom said when we got fired? So he was a beautiful person.

I've had the good fortune to play with his son, Ravi. But even Ravi, unfortunately, was born at a time when he didn't really get to know his dad very well before John passed. So I could probably ramble all night.

Maybe I should stop. But I just want to thank you for coming. This is a very emotional experience for all of us.

Brian and I on the road with Wayne a lot. We talk about Train a lot because Wayne used to practice with him. Train used to call him up and say, you're coming over today and they would sit at the piano.

And one guy, Train would go to the piano and take his elbows and press down as many notes as he could grab and say, how many can you get? And Wayne would try to run all the sounds. And then Wayne would do it for Train and Train would do it.

And then they had Alice's harp books out. And they'd be practicing harp music and trying to just get more harmony. They were tireless in their pursuit of excellence.

There's a big lesson in that for all of us, spiritually, musically, artistically, life. So that's part of the reason why we're here today. Talk about those things.

Now, you know, you got a musician, you got a minister. I have no idea what in the world kind of questions you're going to ask. But we always do it and we think some of you will ask questions.

But we would suggest nothing about auto repair or life on other planets. One of my open forums here, I remember some years ago, somebody asked me what I thought about life on other planets. And what I'm afraid is that John might really know about it.

So I don't want you to ask anything about that. If you got a question, you know, it's a big place here. You ought to go to one of those mics.

Let's see. And we may not take a long time. We might take time.

It depends on you. Uh-huh. Go ahead.

Great performance tonight. The question I have is concerning portraying the later music. I guess 66, 67.

It's a noisy, free, free style. Why don't you play any of that music tonight? But actually, I appreciate the music, but it's just a bit difficult to listen to.

I wanted to get you to grab your thoughts on that period of his music. You want my thoughts on the late period with like interstellar space and stuff like that. Okay.

He's asking about late cult-trained music. Yeah. Late cult-trained music that was pretty intense and sometimes not palatable for people that aren't used to listening to jazz, perhaps.

You know, I think some of the music is very challenging to listen to because it's very dense. But there's a lot of beauty in it. Actually, I would recommend interstellar space.

Because that's him and Rashid Ali, just saxophone and percussion. And there's some arrestingly beautiful music on that. And it's also a saxophonic testament, if you will.

The stuff he's doing on that record is just unbelievable. And so it's appealing in a very visceral way. It's gorgeous music.

It's very beautiful, but it's also extremely powerful. The stuff with Dolphi was, you know, that's a different kind of thing. The stuff with Pharaoh Sanders and the stuff that's very dense with a lot of people doing a lot of things.

I maintain that through all that stuff, you hear his vision. Whether the other guys were always as strong as he was at it as questionable sometimes. But you know, when it comes to obviously his playing, and I believe Rashid Ali played beautifully on a lot of that stuff too.

You know, so I think with him it was all, he was a seeker. You know, he was trying to find new things. So I think all of it has value.

Some of the people that tried to imitate him that I didn't always have patience for because a lot of times they just didn't have the depth of musicianship or soul that he had. They were just sort of jumping on the bandwagon, thinking that if they played free in avant-garde, they'd be like train. Sure.

But yeah, I think there's a lot in there to check out. But I would recommend interstellar space. Keep those kinds of questions coming.

I mean, the questions they go to him. Go ahead. I don't know either which of you will want to answer this question.

But you talked about him being a seeker, and I was curious because I've been reading a little bit more about him in the last week and trying to understand more about his spirituality. And I was wondering what you make of his continued searching beyond Christianity after that period in 1957, particularly toward the latter period of his life. I mean, it seems like that was even connected to some of the music perhaps that he was just talking about.

You know, he kept looking into a lot of different things. I know he spent a lot of time with Eastern philosophies. I really don't, I don't know because I never had a chance to talk to him about it.

And boy, I would have loved to just spend five minutes with him. But I didn't get to. You know, you'd probably have to ask his family really about the depth of that.

And even that, even his children probably couldn't answer you more, more Alice, if you could ask her. But yeah, he did continue to study a lot of different things. And it's.

Let me, I could just add something. The insights that I think we can, I believe, and I try to bring out for you tonight had to do with his insights about the importance of God for spirituality, for music in general. I don't know, I don't think anybody could know where he would have ended up because he was continuing to look at other religions.

You know, my, my hero, my, my ministry hero, CS Lewis, who also though was a very ardent Christian also believed probably there was more grace and insight in other religions than some Christians would like to believe. And the basic insights of John Coltrane though of the relationship between God and music and spirituality remain intact regardless of that. But yeah, absolutely.

He was on an exploration. Unfortunately, I think he died before he figured out some of those things. Let's, we got to go back and forth over here.

Thanks for the performance was fantastic. Another question I actually for both of you. And what I know of John Coltrane's music in life, he was an incredibly intense man.

That in between sets, he would go and practice with other musicians but just hang out in some ways his music changed so much because he was constantly practicing and dedicated to music. And I guess I have a question regarding music and art as a form and how Christians relate to that. Particularly, when you dedicate so much of your life and so much intensity to music, to what degree does that can the music become something you worship in itself.

And, and it sounds like from what I've heard you say, Coltrane moved past that to actually using the music as a form of worship being God or expression of his worship to God. And I'm not sure exactly where that balance is if you spend every waking hour of your whole life practicing to be able to produce something and this could go for any art form, then is that an idol in your life or is that a remarkable dedication that shows your worship to God? That's a great question.

他就是个很好的例子。无论何时你听他的音乐，都能感受到它的力量。它总是深刻的，无论是弹奏成千上万的音符还是仅仅一个音符。他会抓住你，震撼你的灵魂深处。

对我来说，因为我的信仰，这就是上帝的手。当我听到他演奏时，这不仅仅是个人在演奏，而是上帝通过那支号在呐喊。我必须说，在听音乐的时候，我从未听过创作者的力量如此鲜明地体现在一个人身上。我认为很难找到这种深度。

至少在爵士乐中，我不知道是否能找到这样的例子。我不知道它是否存在。当然，在爵士乐中，我不确定。我只是知道，聆听他的音乐对我的影响。

他还坚持不懈地追求自己天赋的发展。他没有浪费自己的天赋。他得到了一个惊人的礼物，但他比任何人都更加努力。他不是18岁时就出道的天才，而是不断工作、练习，甚至撞墙也不放弃。

并不是说他18岁就能做到一切。不。我认识一些在费城与他一起长大的人，他们问过吉米·希思。他记得科尔特兰在发展时的样子。

如果你问他，我还和像本尼·古尔森这样的萨克斯手聊过，他们也认识科尔特兰。他告诉我一个有趣的故事，关于他和Coltrane一起逗Benny Goulson妈妈的事。Benny Goulson的妈妈经常在他家举办爵士乐聚会时请他去玩。你会说：“约翰，记得Duke Ellington演奏的那个Johnny Hodges的曲子吗？

”然后John每次来都会被要求弹那个曲子。有一次他们在一个大乐队里演出，被告知这场演出取消了。但他们走遍社区，看到海报上写着那场演出还在进行中，而他们却被解雇了。于是他们回到家告诉Benny Goulson的妈妈这个消息。

她问：“怎么了，孩子们？”他们说：“我们以为要参加的那个工作现在还在进行，但我们没被邀请。”她说：“别担心，总有一天人们会付很多钱听你们演奏。” 快进20年，在蒙特雷爵士音乐节或纽波特爵士音乐节上。

当然，Benny Goulson当时正在和Art Blakey合作。有一次他们三人在一起，Train突然笑了起来。他说：“你还记得我们被解雇时你妈妈说的话吗？”然后他补充说：“他是一个非常美好的人。

” 我有幸与他的儿子Ravi一起演奏过。但不幸的是，Ravi在John去世前并没有真正了解他的父亲。所以我可能可以一直讲下去。也许我应该停止了。

但我只想感谢你们的到来。对我们所有人来说，这是一次非常感人的经历。我和Brian经常和Wayne一起旅行，我们常常谈论Train，因为Wayne曾经与他一起练习。Train会打电话给Wayne说：“今天你过来一趟。

”然后他们会在钢琴前坐下来。有一次，Train走到钢琴前，用肘部按住尽可能多的键，问：“你能弹多少？”Wayne尽力跑出所有的音符。然后轮到Wayne来试试看，Train也会这样做。

他们还把Alice的竖琴书拿出来练习竖琴曲目，试图获得更多的和声。他们在追求卓越上是不知疲倦的。在这一点上，我们所有人都能学到一个重要的教训，无论是精神上的、音乐上的、艺术上的还是生活中的。所以这就是今天我们聚集在这里的一部分原因。

让我们来谈谈这些事情。现在，你知道的，这里有音乐家，有牧师。我不知道你们会提出什么样的问题。但我们总是这样做的，并且我们认为有些人可能会提问。

但我们会建议不要问关于汽车修理或外星生命的问题。我记得有一次我的一个公开论坛上，有人问我对外星生命的看法。我担心约翰可能真的知道这个问题的答案。所以你们最好不要问这些问题。

如果有问题的话，这里空间很大，你们可以去其中一个麦克风那里提问。好了，今晚的表演很棒。我想问的是关于后期音乐的表现。大概是66年、67年的样子。

那种音乐是嘈杂且自由的风格。为什么今天没有演奏那样的音乐？但实际上，我很欣赏那首曲子，只是有点难以听懂。我想要你谈谈他对那个时期音乐的想法。

你想让我谈谈他晚期的作品，比如星际空间之类的东西。好的。他在问关于后期爵士乐训练的作品。是的。

那些作品非常激烈，有时对不习惯听爵士的人来说可能不太容易接受。你知道的，我认为有些音乐很难听，因为它很密集。但其中有很多美丽之处。实际上，我推荐星际空间。

因为那是他和拉希德·阿里合作的作品，只有萨克斯风和打击乐器。那里面有一些令人惊叹的美丽音乐。而且这也是一种萨克斯风的见证。他在那张唱片上所做的作品简直难以置信。

所以它以一种非常直接的方式吸引人。这是一首美丽的音乐。它很美，但也很有力量。与多菲合作的作品是另一种风格。

与法罗·桑德斯的合作作品则非常密集，很多人在做很多事情。我坚持认为，在所有那些东西中，你都能听到他的愿景。其他人的实力有时确实令人怀疑，但当谈到他的演奏时，我相信拉希德·阿里在很多方面都表现得非常出色。你知道的，我认为他就是一个探索者。

他在尝试寻找新的事物。所以我觉得这一切都有价值。有些试图模仿他的人我不总是很有耐心，因为他们往往缺乏他那种深度的音乐才能或灵魂。他们只是盲目跟风，以为只要演奏自由爵士乐就能像火车一样轰鸣前进。

当然，这并不一定正确。但是确实，里面有很多值得探索的东西。我推荐你听听《星际空间》。继续提出这些问题吧。

你们知道，他们问他的问题很多。你可以先回答这个问题，我不确定是哪位想回答。你说他是个探索者，我也很好奇，因为我最近一周读了一些关于他的资料，并试图更多地了解他的灵性。我想知道他对1957年之后的持续探寻基督教之外的东西的看法，特别是在他生命的后期阶段。

这似乎与他所谈论的一些音乐有关。你知道的，他一直在探索很多不同的东西。我知道他曾花了很多时间研究东方哲学。我其实并不清楚具体情况，因为我从未有机会和他交谈过。

如果能和他见上五分钟就好了，但我没有这个机会。你可能需要问他的家人来了解这些细节。甚至他的孩子们也无法更深入地回答你的问题，尤其是艾丽丝。但她确实一直在学习很多不同的东西。

让我补充一点。我认为今晚我想给你们带来的见解有关他对神在灵性、音乐等方面的重要性的一些洞察。我不知道他会走到哪里，因为他还在不断探索其他宗教。我的英雄，我的事工英雄CS刘易斯也是一位非常坚定的基督徒，他也可能认为其他宗教中有一些比某些基督徒愿意相信的更多的恩典和洞察力。

尽管如此，约翰·科尔特兰关于神与音乐、灵性之间关系的基本见解依然成立。但确实，他一直在探索。不幸的是，我认为他在弄清楚这些事情之前就去世了。我们得在这边来回讨论一下。

感谢表演，真是太棒了。还有一道问题我想问你们俩。根据我对约翰·科尔特兰音乐生涯的了解，他是一个极其投入的人。在每组演出之间，他都会和其他音乐家一起练习，甚至只是闲聊。

他的音乐之所以发生了如此大的变化，是因为他不断地练习并且全心投入到音乐中。我有一个关于音乐和艺术形式的问题，特别是当你们把生命中的大部分时间和精力都投入到音乐中时，音乐到什么程度可以成为一种崇拜的对象。从你刚才说的话来看，科尔特兰确实超越了这一点，开始用音乐作为一种崇拜的形式来表达他对神的敬拜。我不知道这种平衡在哪里，如果你把每一个清醒时刻都用来练习以创作出某种东西，这在任何艺术形式中都是如此，那么这种投入是偶像崇拜还是对神的一种卓越奉献？

## 专注与偶像崇拜 / Dedication and Idolatry

He's saying, when does your dedication to your art, whether it's music, any kind of art, your practice of it, when does it kind of, when does the line blur and it become idols? An idol to you that you worship. This is a thing that we all struggle with.

I believe if you're honest with yourself and you're passionate about music and your life, you have to deal with this issue. I can't speak for Trane how he dealt with it, I don't know. I know that he was known to be a serious practitioner.

He did, he would play his solo, leave the mic, walk in the kitchen at the van garden, keep practicing while McCoy played his solo. He was constantly practicing. Whenever he came to the front door at the house, I know people that visited him.

He would always have the strap around his, the next strap of the saxophone around his neck. So I don't know, I also know that he did, he was around his family a lot as well too. It's difficult to say I wasn't there.

I know for me it's a big challenge, I have a wife and I have two daughters. It's a big thing, you have to make time for your family, you have to make time. In my case, because I'm a believer, I have to make time to spend with the Lord.

I need to have quiet time, I need time for study. I'm a theology student, I love to study and read, I read a lot of books. I wish I could say that I knew the perfect balance and that I never went over that line.

But I honestly can't say that, I'd say that I struggle with it too. Luckily I have an amazing wife who is able to gracefully tug my co-tail to it when I need somebody to do that. And sort of help me to keep a broader view of my life and not get swallowed up by that fiddle over there or the electric pay so the piano or composing or whatever else.

I can say this though, you got to be careful with that too. Some people say, well you know, when you're doing music, it can be an idol and it's going to get in the way of the Lord. Well, actually some of the times I felt closest to the Lord when I was holding that thing in my hands and playing, feeling his presence, feeling that I was finally getting out of the way in my life for an hour or two.

Or I have to say sometimes when I don't have it in my hands, I grasp for the wheel sometimes. So sometimes the converse can be true. Also it can be a time when God uses music to say, you know what?

Step aside, let me work. So it's both. I think you struggle with it and then sometimes he extends his mercy and he helps you to grow even while you're pursuing your music.

No, that's a beautiful, that's perfectly balanced remarks from John. Actually the only thing I could say is that this isn't just a problem with music. I have a great marriage and I've been very, very intrigued by letters of John Newton, the guy who wrote amazing grace.

He had a great marriage and he said he always struggled with making his wife into an idol. Do you have a lousy marriage? That's an affliction.

That's a problem. That's a great spiritual challenge. If you have a great marriage, that's an affliction.

That's a huge spiritual challenge because you're always going over into making what your wife says and in your wife's love more important than God's love. So actually this isn't a problem just with music. I just want you all to know.

And Saren Kerkegard said that the essence of sin is building our identity on anything but God. So the essence of sin is not so much doing bad things but it's making good things into ultimate things. And anybody who's really good at music or preaching or marriage is always just sort of falling off always sort of getting your feet wet into idolatry and having to come back.

I think that's the way it is with just virtually everybody but that's the place where you have to live your life. That's the tension place that you have to live. It's estimated that most of us spend half of our waking hours at work.

How does the wisdom of the Bible apply to our careers? In other words, how can our work connect with God's work and how can our vocations be more emotional? In his book, Every Good and Devar Tim Keller draws from decades of teaching on vocation and calling to show you how to find true joy in your work as you serve God and others.

The book offers surprising insights into how a Christian perspective on work can serve as the foundation for a thriving career and a balanced personal life. Every Good and Devar is our thank you for your gift to help gospel and life share Christ's love with more people around the world. Just visit gospel and life dot com slash give.

That's gospel and life dot com slash give. Now here's Dr. Keller with the remainder of today's teaching.

Okay, let's go back over here at the right. You talked about how John Coltrane how a lot of his music was like an overflow of his spirituality. And I was curious like as a Christian and as an artist, how do you deal with times when you're not feeling the presence of God or when you don't?

Yeah, you're just not feeling it. And I guess with that, I guess as a Christian and as an artist, you need discipline. So how do you keep discipline from becoming like legalism or just like drudgery?

I'm sorry, that last part, I like how do you keep like legalism? I'm discipline from like becoming like a sort of legalism or a drudgery about about like with music and with practicing. Okay, there's something that I always tell my students and I think it's a real big truism.

And first of all, you know, I spend a lot of my life traveling around with Wayne Shorters group. And Brian, the drummer you heard tonight, who's like a right arm left. I mean, he's really close.

I can tell you what happens when I feel like I'm entering like if I'm, you know, we show up at a concert, we took two flights, we took a car, we're fried. We get to the place. The only way to combat that thing of where it becomes drudgery or you're tired and you have your dry, whether you're dry spiritually or whether your spiritual dryness becomes musical dryness or whether you just feel uninspired.

The way out of it is to get outside yourself quit looking all the way inner and just open your eyes and look around you. There are other people right there with you and somebody is going to do something inspiring. Somebody's going to play something that makes you think differently if you're just open to it.

And all of a sudden, you're often running and where you were fried and you couldn't think of anything to play 30 seconds ago, somebody plays something and boom, you're off. If you're open to it, see when we get all like, oh, no, I got to do this or what about that shift or what about this chords? If we get wrapped up in that, it's just like a lead weight and just we go sinking down.

But if we, if we look outside of ourselves, it's amazing what can happen. And that's a metaphor for your life too. Your spiritual life too.

God is always that metaphor of looking up and receiving from Him instead of trying to have your hands on the wheel and do it all yourself. And generate it all yourself and your works and this and that. If you just do this and this, it's going to be great.

So that's getting outside of that kind of tunnel vision, that insular thing which makes you just sort of cave in on yourself. Over here. On the directions and music tour about five years ago, I saw you play with, I wanted to ask Brian this too, but I saw you play with Brecker and Hargrove and Herbie Hancock and stuff.

And right before Michael Brecker played Naima, he gave like a two or three minute talk on his, when he got his first Coltrane album, his first Coltrane record. And he described like, he always, I forget who was listening to it at the time, he was like 13 or something, but he went into a lot of depth about how when he listened to it, it didn't make sense. But then it ended up sounded like, I know the words he's were like emotional and intelligent.

And I was, I was hoping you were going to explain this earlier, you started to go into a little bit how when you were a nine or ten, but what was your first experience with hearing Coltrane and did it, did it stick right away or was it like, what's this dude doing all these scales or like, how did it, how did it make sense to you? Because to a lot of people, Coltrane doesn't make sense when the first team, I'm a jazz pianist. But the first time I heard Coltrane, I was like, okay, this is a lot of notes, I'll listen to Witten Kelley or whatever.

But, you know, but it grows on you, you know, I'm just wondering like, what was your first experience with him? Like, were you exposed to him through another musician? Did you accidentally buy it, thinking it was something else?

Trying to remember what the first record was, and it might have been, let's see, it might have been giant steps, which had Equinox on it also was an Atlantic record. I have to say that the emotion of it always grabbed me, even before I understood harmonically and rhythmically what he was doing. He went right through me immediately.

Same with Wayne, when I heard Wayne's first music, I was about eight, I heard children of the night on the mosaic, our Blakey record. I didn't understand what they were doing, but there was this searing quality, the saxophone, there was just this soulful cry that went boom right inside. Train was like that with me, the record with giant steps, even though that's a highly, that was again one of his manifestos harmonically.

He laid this thing out that he'd been working on. Just, it's like Billy Hart said, whether he was playing one note or 30 million notes, it always sounds like he's playing a ballad. There's all this beauty and spiritual force coming through.

So even before I could understand it, and giant steps is a good example, Equinox is on that record which is slower also and very blues. I could always hear the, you know, his grandfather was a preacher, and that cadence is always in his playing too. That kind of vocal speech-like thing, and the tenor saxophone's very close to the human voice.

So that always grabbed me, even though I didn't know what they were doing. So that was, it kind of grabbed me young. Over here.

This question sort of touches on everything that's a few questions I'd been asked before about a cult trains, a phenomenal commitment to practicing anecdotes about him playing a seed major scale for 11 hours straight. Just one of the curious as to how you think that informs his attitude on work versus faith, on the sheer aesthetic discipline of his practice regimen versus his commitment to spirituality later on in life. Wow.

Did everybody hear that? The question about how he pursued his art with practicing, practicing how that affected his art, whether his aesthetic, you know, musical aestheticism. What affected that have, was it a works mentality by practicing like this, this is you'll get good?

You know, I have to say that when you redefine your instrument and you become a great virtuoso like trained did, I think he needed that to express the depth of his spiritual feelings that he had. I joke with my students, I hate when students say, I play what I feel, you know, I don't need to learn all this stuff. So yeah, when you have all those feelings and you're so frustrated because you can't get it out your hands.

Classical example, some people try to elevate naivete in music and sometimes even incompetence to like they worship that. Like if you know too much, well, then you can't be good. You can't play with feeling if you know too much.

Coltrane shatters that to bits. There's no one more soulful on the planet that ever walked the planet and there's no one who knew that much on his instrument. So it kind of blows away the works thing.

In other words, he had to have all those that flexibility to say what it needed to say. And it never, to me, it never got out of proportion. It was misused.

It was never technique for technique sake. It was technique in the service of a masterful soulful expression of music that, you know, still saxophone players are trying to figure out what he did. It's been gone a long time.

40 years. Ask Mike Brecker and all these guys who are the pagan emis of today and they'll tell you that train is still their hero. The only thing I could add, it's amazing how many residences there are with everything else besides music.

But in the beginning, I think almost anybody in a career in the very beginning, you are, it is a kind of works righteousness. You're working hard because you want to be accepted. But you often see with people who get the acceptance they want.

这是一个很好的问题。他说，你对艺术的投入，不论是音乐还是其他任何形式的艺术，当你练习它的时候，什么时候这条线开始模糊，变成一种偶像？对你来说，是你崇拜的东西。这是我们每个人都会面对的问题。

我相信如果你对自己诚实，并且热爱音乐和生活，就必须面对这个问题。我不知道特雷恩是怎么处理的，但我知道他是个非常严肃的练习者。他会在独奏时离开麦克风，走进车上的厨房继续练琴，而麦科伊在演奏他的独奏。他总是不断地练习。

我记得有人拜访过他家，无论何时他从门口进来，他脖子上总挂着萨克斯的肩带。我也知道他经常和家人在一起。很难说我没有在那里。对我来说，这是一项巨大的挑战，我有一个妻子和两个女儿。

家庭时间非常重要，你必须安排时间。因为我是一个信徒，在我的情况下，我还必须安排时间与主相聚。我需要安静的时间，也需要学习的时间。我是神学学生，我喜欢阅读和研究，读了很多书。

我希望我能说我已经找到了完美的平衡，并且从未越过那条线。但老实说，我也不能这么说，我认为我自己也在挣扎。幸运的是，我有一个非常棒的妻子，她总是在我需要的时候温柔地提醒我，帮助我保持对生活的更宽广的视角，而不是被那边的小提琴、电钢琴或者其他事情所吞没。不过我可以这样说，你也要小心这一点。

有些人说，当你在做音乐时，它可能会变成一种偶像，并妨碍你与主的关系。实际上，有时候当我拿着那件乐器演奏时，我觉得自己离上帝最近，感受到他的同在，感觉到终于在自己的生活中退后一步，至少有一两个小时。> 你必须小心这一点。有时候，当我没有它在手中时，我会去抓方向盘。

所以有时情况可能正好相反。此外，这也是一个上帝通过音乐来说“你知道吗？”的时候。退一步，让我来工作。

因此，两者兼而有之。我想你可能会挣扎，但有时他会施予怜悯，帮助你在追求音乐的同时成长。不错，约翰的话确实很完美地平衡了这一点。实际上，我能说的唯一一件事是，这不仅仅是一个关于音乐的问题。

我有一段很好的婚姻，并且对约翰·牛顿的信件非常感兴趣，他就是写了《奇妙恩典》的人。他的婚姻也很美满，但他一直挣扎着把妻子当作偶像。你们的婚姻糟糕吗？那是一种痛苦。

那是一个问题。这是一个巨大的灵性挑战。如果你有一段美好的婚姻，那也是一种痛苦。这是一项巨大的灵性挑战，因为你总是将你妻子的话和她对你的爱看得比上帝的爱更重要。

所以实际上，这不仅仅是一个关于音乐的问题。我只是想让你们都知道这一点。塞伦·克尔凯郭尔曾经说过，罪的本质是建立我们的身份在除了上帝之外的任何事物上。因此，罪的本质不是做坏事，而是将好的东西变成终极的东西。

无论你多么擅长音乐、讲道或婚姻，你总是会不知不觉地陷入偶像崇拜的陷阱，然后不得不重新找回。我认为这几乎适用于每一个人。这就是你要生活的处境。这就是你需要面对的张力。

据估计，我们大约一半清醒的时间都在工作上。圣经中的智慧如何应用于我们的职业生涯？换句话说，我们的工作如何与上帝的工作相连接，我们的职业如何更具情感性？在《每一份好工作》一书中，蒂姆·凯勒从数十年的职业和呼召教学中汲取灵感，向你展示如何通过服务上帝和他人，在工作中找到真正的快乐。

现在让我们听 Dr. Keller 继续今天的教导。好的，让我们回到右边这里。你提到约翰·科尔特雷恩如何很多音乐都是他灵性的一种溢出。我很好奇，作为一名基督徒和艺术家，在你不觉得上帝同在或没有灵感的时候，你会怎么处理？

是的，就是那种感觉不到的状态。我想说，作为一名基督徒和艺术家，你需要自律。那么你怎么保持自律而不让它变成一种教条主义或者只是枯燥的工作呢？对不起，最后一部分，我更想问的是你如何保持自律而不让其变成一种教条或枯燥？

对于音乐和练习来说是这样。我总是告诉我的学生，我认为**这是真的真理**。首先，你知道我在 Wayne Shorter 的乐队里度过了很多时间。今晚我们还听到了 Brian，鼓手，他是我的右臂左腿。

他真的很亲近。我可以告诉你当我觉得自己进入那种状态时会发生什么——我们知道要演出，坐了两趟飞机，又坐车，累坏了。到达目的地后，唯一的办法就是对抗那种枯燥或感到疲惫的感觉，无论是精神上的还是音乐上的干燥感，或者只是缺乏灵感。走出这种困境的方法是让你自己脱离出来，停止内省，而是睁开眼睛看看周围。

那里有其他人和你在一起，有人会做一些鼓舞人心的事情。有人会演奏一些会让你思考不同的东西，只要你愿意接受它。突然间，你常常在忙碌中煎熬，30秒前还在想不出要做什么，但有人一播放音乐，你就豁然开朗了。如果你愿意接受这一点，当我们在纠结于“我必须这样做”或“那个调子呢？

”或“这些和弦呢？”时，这就像一个沉重的铅块，让你逐渐沉沦。但如果我们将目光从自我转移到外界，你会发现不可思议的事情会发生。这也是对你生活的隐喻，对你的灵性生活也是如此。

上帝总是那个向上看、接受祂恩典的象征，而不是试图自己掌控一切，自己创造一切，自己的工作和成就。只要这样去做，就会很好。所以这就是要跳出那种狭隘的视野，那种孤立无援的感觉，让自己不再自我封闭。在几年前的音乐之旅中，我曾看到你们与Brecker、Hargrove和Herbie Hancock等人一起演出。

就在Michael Brecker演奏Naima之前，他给了一个大约两到三分钟关于他第一次听到Coltrane专辑的故事。他说当时大概13岁左右，他对那张专辑进行了深入的描述：当他第一次听时，完全不懂其中的意思。但后来他觉得那些歌词充满了情感和智慧。我希望你能更早些解释这一点，你之前提到过你在九或十岁时的经历。

但你的第一次Coltrane体验是怎样的？它立刻吸引了你吗？还是你觉得他在做各种音阶呢？对于很多人来说，初听Coltrane时确实难以理解。

我是爵士钢琴家，但当我第一次听到Coltrane时，我也觉得有很多音符，我决定先听听Witten Kelley的演奏。但是，你知道，它会慢慢吸引你。我在想，你们第一次接触他是什么样的体验？是通过另一位音乐家吗？

还是不小心买到了，以为是别的东西？我记得第一次接触到他的唱片可能是《巨步》，这张专辑里也有《Equinox》。当时这张唱片是在大西洋唱片发行的。不得不说的是，每次听他的音乐，那种情感总是会立刻抓住我，即使在我还不理解他和声与节奏上的处理之前。

同样地，当我八岁的时候听到韦恩·肖特的第一张音乐作品时，《Mosaic》里的《Children of the Night》，布莱克利的专辑。我不明白他们在做什么，但萨克斯的声音有一种刺痛的感觉，在我心里发出了强烈的灵魂呼唤。《巨步》这张唱片对我也有同样的影响，即使那是他和声理念中一个高度复杂的宣言。他把一直在研究的东西展现了出来。

就像比莉·哈乐戴所说的一样，无论他弹奏一音还是三十万音，听起来都像是在演奏一首摇篮曲。其中充满了美丽与精神的力量。所以，在我完全理解之前，巨步这张唱片就是一个很好的例子，《Equinox》也在那张专辑里，速度较慢且充满蓝调元素。我能听到那种来自他的祖父——一个牧师的语调，这种吟唱般的音色和中音萨克斯的声音非常接近人的声音。

这总是吸引着我，即使我不明白他们在做什么。所以它在我年轻的时候就抓住了我。这里的问题触及了很多之前有人问过我的问题，比如“火车迷”崇拜，他对练习有着非凡的承诺，关于他连续11个小时演奏大调音阶的故事。我对这种现象感到好奇，你认为这如何影响了他的工作观与信仰观？

他在美学上的严格训练和后来对精神生活的承诺之间有何联系？哇，真是令人惊叹。大家听清楚了吗？关于他如何通过练习来追求艺术，练习对他艺术的影响，是否影响了他的审美观、音乐美学。

是什么因素影响了这些呢？是这种不断练习的态度吗？就像这样练下去，你就会变得更好？说实话，当我重新定义我的乐器，并成为像特纳一样经过严格训练的杰出演奏家时，我认为他需要这样的训练来表达自己深刻的精神感受。

## 超越成功 / Beyond Success

They get successful and they still go on. And I think it's because they realize at a certain point now I've got a vision. I want to get it out.

And obviously, my concern is more rhetoric and narrative. And I'm always frustrated now because I know what I want to say but I never feel like I quite get there to say it. In the earlier days of being a preacher, I worked by crazy because I wanted people to accept me.

Now I'm accepted. I really want to say certain things that I can't do unless I work by crazy to do it. I think John's absolutely right.

There are some people that need to prove yourself, never goes away. And you can hear it in some musicians. It's always about me.

Our little talks tonight said that somewhere, Coltrane because of his spiritual awakening, blew past that. And it wasn't about him anymore. It wasn't works righteousness.

Now he had a vision and he had a mission. And he just wanted to do it as well as he could. And that's what we all should be after.

And in fact, Miles used to say, why are you playing so long? Don't you ever take the horn out of your mouth? And Trane was so beautiful.

He wasn't salty back or anything. I'm just trying to get to this thing and I got to get there. And he was very humble.

He felt like I can't quite get it. It's taken me that long. When I play one of my soul, it takes me a while.

I'm trying to find this thing. Meanwhile, the rest of us would love to be trying to find something like Trane. I wish I could try to find something like that too.

Because his supposed searching and scuffling was 80 million times better than the rest of us could even imagine or dream. Good. Let's keep going back forth over here.

I know that there's a lot of deep emotional and spiritual music today. But I feel if you could reflect on the change in our mainstream attitude toward music, I always feel like I'm looking back and capturing something greater than today. But I know it's there.

We heard it tonight. It was amazing. I just personally wish it was more of it.

And maybe you have thoughts on your growth up position. Wow. So basically you're saying sometimes it just feels like there was a lot of deeper connection in the music back.

When we listen to old records and we hear this purity that attracts us because it has nothing to do with marketing and Wall Street and lawyers negotiating contracts, frankly. Yeah, I live in this world. We all do.

And that's something that Brian and I talk a lot about. That's what Wayne Shorter. We all talk about this a lot.

We feel like we have a mission. We feel like we're swimming up stream a lot of times. But nonetheless, we feel compelled to continue.

Sometimes it takes courage because the record companies, even with Wayne's group, frankly, they sometimes seem to value, but not much value on what we're doing. They're trying to chase the newest flavor of the month. If they can get a pop singer and sell millions of records.

Hey, that's where their priority is. So you can't let it get you bitter. You have to continue on your mission.

You have to be disciplined. Because if you let it, it'll stop you. And for me, there's an added thing about I feel like God has given me something important that I need to keep pursuing.

Whether it's popular with the business folks or not. I really can't think about that. Yeah, I have to provide for my family, which I work hard to do.

But when it comes to my art and the music that I write and I play and the records that I make for myself, I feel of responsibility. To God to people, I must do the utmost thing I can do. The most I can use, whatever I have, to make the most honest music that I can, to reach out to people in an honest way, instead of trying to be something that's the flavor of the month this year, which changes every month.

That's why somebody like Wayne shorter is so important. He never gave in. He never stopped.

And that's why train loved him also around. Thanks. Hi, and you earlier talk, you mentioned that one of the things that defines us is our work.

And certainly I feel like it's taken a lot of my time. Maybe it's because I'm not really a musician. I feel that sometimes my work takes me away from my spiritual side.

So maybe you could give a guidance of sharing experience. How when times it's a you feel not disconnected with yourself. How you come back to present.

How do you come back to your spiritual side? Yes, I'll be brief. There's a sense in which there's a micro meaning and a macro meaning.

The micro meaning, I think, your micro identity. That is, who are you? Micro identity is, you look at your gifts, you look at what you're good at, and you do it.

And there's that great place in the chair. It's a fire where Eric Little says, God made me fast. And when I run, I feel this pleasure.

So if you're fast, you run. If you're an artist, you do art and so forth. If you make great business deals, make great business deals.

When you use your gifts that you've been given, you feel like you fit in the universe. That's what that line in the movie means. And from a Christian point of view, we think your gifts and talents aren't accidents.

They didn't happen just accidentally. It's what God wants you to be. That's your micro meaning.

If you don't have the macro meaning, and the macro meaning is that you're a child of God, and that you have a relationship with him, and when I use the word child, this is a Christian understanding of this, a child of God. I have children. And if one of my children does well, I'm very proud of them, and my heart goes out toward them.

If one of my children does horribly and does everything wrong, I'm more engaged with them. In other words, being a father means I love my kids. And whether they're doing well or not doing well, whatever they do draws my heart out toward them.

To be a child of God means I know that I'm in His grace, I've experienced His grace. He loves me unconditionally. Knowing that is your macro meaning.

If you don't have the macro meaning, then your micro meaning becomes the macro meaning. And that's really what the sickness on the death by Curegard is. When your work and your gifts become your whole meaning, then somehow you'll find, just like Tolkien felt, because he could never really write the book he wants, just like Tim Keller feels he could never really preach the ceremony once.

John Patatucci never can quite get out what he wants to get out. If that's the whole of your life, then you're always unhappy. You always feel like I'm falling short, I'm not doing what I want to do.

So you've got to put your gift and your mission and your art and your work in a diamond in a bigger setting, and it's got to be a setting of knowing I'm a child of God. Without that, then the work becomes the idol and it drives you to the ground. So I think there has to be a balance between the two things.

And that's what makes people bitter too, I think. People are struggling and they can only see right in front of them. And they keep reaching for that thing and they can't quite get it.

If that's all there is, then it's pretty rough existence being an artist. Unless you have that hope. Now, even though I'm going back and forth, I think these folks have been waiting longer, so go ahead.

Hi, I'm a mother of two jazz musicians, one who plays and the other promotes, and I also minister and I'm often going home on the train about three or four in the morning. And I see the passion in both of you, and I also find it in the musicians, including my sons, with whom I minister. And they're great spirits, but what I'm asking both of you is, I heard one of them say to me, we don't come to you and you don't come to us in terms of reaching out as Christians, as believers.

And I'm asking for ways because what I'd love to do is bring Brian to you and say, Brian, I want you to know a musician who believes in Jesus Christ. Is that your son's name, Brian? Oh, okay.

And Andrew too. Yeah. Well, bring him.

And bring him on. Okay. I will.

Yeah. I've got tears in my eyes and I thank you all so much. Yeah.

It just means so much. And there are so many people out there who need hope and future. And God has blessed me to do what I love doing and to reach out and this just inspires me so.

我经常和学生们开玩笑说，我不喜欢学生说：“我只是凭感觉演奏，不需要学这么多东西。” 所以当你们有这些情感，却因为无法将其表现出来而感到沮丧时。一个经典的例子是，有些人试图在音乐中提升天真无邪或甚至不成熟的状态，并且有时甚至崇拜这种状态。如果你知道太多，那你就不能好。

如果你知道太多，就不能真正地用感情去演奏。但是科尔特兰打破了这一点。他是这个星球上最富有情感的人之一，同时他也是那个时代对乐器掌握得最好的人。所以这完全颠覆了“作品”观念。

换句话说，他必须具备那种灵活性来表达需要传达的东西，并且这种表达从没有失去比例。它从未被滥用。它从来不是为了技术而技术，而是服务于一种精湛的情感音乐表达。甚至现在萨克斯演奏家们还在试图理解他是如何做到这一点的。

他已经离开这个世界40年了。问迈克·布雷克和其他今天的乐坛偶像，他们仍然会告诉你特纳是他们的英雄。我能补充的一点是，令人惊讶的是，在其他一切事情上都有住处的人，却在音乐上有住处。但在最初的时候，我认为几乎每个人在职业生涯的开始阶段都是出于一种“作品正直”的心态。

你努力工作是因为你想被接受。但你会发现，当人们得到了他们想要的成功和认可后，他们仍然继续前进。我想这是因为他们在某个时刻意识到：我现在有了一个愿景，我想要把它表达出来。显然，我更关心的是修辞和叙事。

现在我总是感到沮丧，因为我知道自己想说什么，但总觉得表达不出来。早些年当牧师的时候，我是靠激情来吸引人们的。而现在，我已经被人接受了。我真的想说一些东西，但除非用激情去表达，否则无法做到。

我认为约翰说得完全正确。有些人需要证明自己，这种需求永远不会消失。你可以在一些音乐家身上听到这一点，一切都关于“我”。今晚我们简短的交谈中提到，因为有了灵性的觉醒，科尔特兰超越了那种自我证明的心态。

那已经不是关于他自己的事情了，不再是功利主义。现在他有了一种愿景和使命，只想尽可能地做好。这才是我们应该追求的目标。事实上，迈尔斯曾经说过：“你为什么拉得这么长？

你怎么不把号拿出来？” 科尔特兰真是太美了。他并不急躁或自大。我只是想找到这种感觉，而我还在努力。

他非常谦逊。他总是觉得自己还没有达到那种境界，花了很长时间。当我演奏我的灵魂乐时，也需要花些时间。我在寻找这种东西。

与此同时，我们其他人也希望能像科尔特兰那样去追寻。我也希望自己能找到那样的东西。因为他的探索和挣扎比我们所有人所能想象或梦想的要美好上数亿倍。好的，让我们继续来回讨论这个问题。

我知道现在有很多深刻的情感和灵性音乐。但我总觉得如果能反思一下主流态度对音乐的看法，我总是觉得我在回顾过去并捕捉到比今天更伟大的东西。但这确实存在。今晚我们听到了这一点，真是太棒了。

我个人希望更多地听到这样的音乐。也许你对自己的成长位置有一些想法？哇哦。基本上你是说有时候感觉音乐中的深层连接更多一些吧。

当我们听老唱片，听到那种纯粹的声音吸引我们时，那是因为它与营销、华尔街和律师谈判合同毫无关系。坦率地说。是的，我生活在这样的世界里，我们都生活在这样的世界里。关于这一点，我和布莱恩经常讨论。

这就是韦恩·肖特所说的。我们经常谈论这个话题。我们觉得自己有使命在身。很多时候像是逆流而上。

但无论如何，我们都被迫继续前行。这有时需要勇气，因为唱片公司，即使是对于韦恩的乐队来说，他们有时候似乎不太重视我们在做的事情。他们试图追逐最新的流行趋势。如果能有个流行歌手卖几百万张唱片的话。

嘿，这就是他们的优先事项。所以你不能让这些事情让你变得愤世嫉俗。你必须继续你的使命。你必须自律。

因为如果你放任不管，它会让你停下来。对我来说，还有一件额外的事情，我觉得上帝给了我一件重要的事情需要我不断追求。无论商业人士是否喜欢我的作品。我真的不会去想这个。

是的，我确实要养家糊口，这让我很努力地工作。但当涉及到我的艺术、我创作和演奏的音乐以及我自己制作的唱片时，我觉得有责任对上帝和人们来说，我必须尽我所能去做。用我所拥有的所有东西来做出最真诚的音乐，以诚恳的方式去触动人心，而不是试图成为今年的流行趋势，这个趋势每个月都在变化。这就是为什么像韦恩·肖特这样的人如此重要。

他从不妥协，从未停止。这也是为什么火车喜欢他。谢谢。你们之前提到过，定义我们的一件事是我们的工作。

确实，我觉得我的时间花在上面很多。也许是因为我不是**真正的音乐家，我有时觉得我的工作让我远离了我的精神层面。所以你能否分享一些经验？当感觉与自己脱节时，你是**如何回到现在的状态的？

如何找回你的灵性？是的，我会简短地说。这里面有微观意义和宏观意义。微观意义在于你个人的身份认同，即你是谁。

微观身份是指你要认识自己的天赋，找到自己擅长的地方，并为之努力。就像埃里克·利特尔所说的“快跑”，他说上帝赋予了我速度，在奔跑时我能感受到这种快乐。所以如果你速度快，就去跑步；如果你是艺术家，就去做艺术创作；如果你能做成大生意，那就去做吧。当你使用上帝赐予你的天赋时，你会觉得自己融入了这个世界。

这就是电影中那句话的含义。从基督教的角度来看，我们认为你的天赋和才能不是偶然的，而是上帝希望你成为的样子。这就是微观意义。如果没有宏观意义，那么宏观意义就是你是上帝的孩子，与祂有关系。

当我说“孩子”这个词时，这是指一种基督教的理解方式——你是上帝的孩子。我有自己的孩子，如果我的一个孩子表现得很好，我会为他们感到骄傲；如果他们做得很糟糕，甚至犯了很多错误，我也会更加关心他们。作为父亲意味着我爱你的孩子，无论他们做得好还是不好，他们的行为都会触动我的心。同样地，成为上帝的孩子意味着我知道自己在祂的恩典中，体验过祂的恩典，祂无条件地爱着我。

知道这一点就是你的宏观意义。如果没有宏观意义，那么微观意义就变成了你生活的全部。这就是《治愈之光》中的那种病态——当你的工作和天赋成了你生活的全部时，就像托尔金无法完成他想写的书，或者提摩西·凯勒觉得无法完全传达他想要表达的信息一样；约翰·帕塔图奇也无法完全实现他的创作愿望。如果你的生活就是如此，那你总是会感到不快乐，总是觉得自己做得不够好。

所以你们要把自己的天赋、使命、艺术和工作放在更大的背景中，这个背景就是我知道自己是上帝的孩子。如果没有这一点，那么工作就会变成偶像，会将你拖垮。因此我认为这两者之间必须保持平衡。这也是让人们感到苦涩的原因之一吧。

人们在挣扎，只能看到眼前的那一点，不断伸手去够却总是抓不到。如果这就是全部的话，那么作为艺术家的生活确实很艰难。除非有希望。虽然我来来回回的，但我觉得这些人等得更久一些，你们可以继续了。

大家好，我是两个爵士音乐家的母亲，一个演奏，另一个推广，我自己也做牧师，经常晚上三、四点才坐火车回家。我看到了你们的热情，我也在乐手中看到同样的热情，包括我的儿子们，我们都在一起事工。他们都是很好的灵魂，但我希望你们能理解的是，其中一个对我说过：“我们作为基督徒、信徒，彼此之间并没有伸手相助。” 我现在想问的是，有没有什么方法呢？

因为我真的很希望能把布莱恩介绍给你们，布莱恩，我想让你认识一个信耶稣的音乐家。这是你儿子的名字吗，布莱恩？哦，好的。还有安德鲁也是。

好的。请带他们来吧。我马上去。是的。

## 恩典与感恩 / Grace and Gratitude

Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you. Go ahead. Thanks.

I have a question, but it doesn't have anything to do with music. Oh, no. Wait a minute.

I don't know everything about everything else, but music. Say I want to, I want to measure in science, and I want to be a teacher, but, and I believe in God. But part of that has to do with evolution.

What if I don't believe in evolution, but I teach it. Have you deal with that? Fortunately, I can be real, real brief about this.

Your belief of evolution does not matter to your acceptance of the, you know, Orthodox teaches a Christianity. People who believe in the most orthodox faith have different views on evolution. So you cannot, it's a red herring to think that a particular view of evolution fits in with, say, Orthodox Christianity.

If I don't have it, I can't be an Orthodox Christian. It's not true. Now, I'm not going to go any further than that, but the point is that people have got all sorts of views on evolution across the spectrum, and, therefore, I always say to people, figure out what you, you know, if Jesus is the son of God, resurrected from the dead, figure that out.

That makes every difference. If that's the case, then you have to live like this. If it doesn't, then you don't have to live like this.

You can live like this. That's what matters. Don't even worry about the evolution thing.

Get to that later. And I have very strong Christian friends that have virtually every view possible about evolution. So don't let it distract you.

Okay. Over here. Yes.

I was just curious to hear some thoughts of yours about maybe some of John Coltrane's later work as a soloist versus some of his earlier works. Like, for instance, everything after interstellar space versus everything before. Like I was thinking that when I listen to giant steps or interstellar space or anything from around that period, I hear, you know, his new concepts and his advanced new styles of playing more fully developed than when I listen to his some of his later work.

And I always kind of wondered if that was maybe running parallel to what was going on in his spiritual life at the same time this surgeon. I don't know how to describe that because that's a very personal thing that he was doing. You know, I remember sometimes feeling like, well, you know, I have my favorites.

I have many favorite periods of train and sometimes the absolute latest. You know, I just, just when I thought that maybe, you know, I had heard some of the later stuff and I didn't like it as much as the earliest. Then I heard a track one time of him playing alto.

It was very late Coltrane that destroyed me. It was unbelievable. It was with Alice Coltrane and him.

I don't know who maybe Rashid. I don't even know what record it was. I just think you have to dig around and you have to listen to it.

You can't just listen to it once or twice and go, well, you know, I like giant steps better because there's a lot of stuff. You have to be patient. But yeah, I can't speak for him because he was really on this amazing path and search that I can't say what he was thinking.

And I really sometimes I have to go back. You know, I have a lot of Coltrane records a ton. But, you know, I go through periods where I listen a lot and then I move away from it for a while and then I come back.

And the really late stuff is not what I often go to first when I come back to listen to him. Do you mind if I follow? I was just wondering though, do you hear like the same levels of organization and where he was going technically or?

I think whenever he played his horn throughout his entire life, there's always a genius level of organizational stuff happening. There's never a record you can point to where it's not. It's just overwhelming.

We've gone 30 minutes and some of you are voting that this time should be about up. I think because you've been waiting, I'll take one more question and I'm afraid this is going to be it everybody. Sorry, go ahead.

Over here. Okay, this is an interesting question you might not expect. Actually, when you guys were talking about music, I didn't get it.

So, my question is, is there hope for someone that don't actually understand jazz? Like how about a three minute version of jazz for dummies? Here it is.

I've got one for you. People say I don't understand jazz. Okay, I always come back with, do you understand Beethoven or Mozart?

Can you comprehend their genius yet? You can listen to the music and go, wow, you don't feel the need to try to understand it, do you? You just listen to it and go, wow, that's what jazz is like.

If you listen to culture and you don't have to understand what he's doing, but you can just listen to the emotional part of it and you can either receive it and you don't have to receive it. I don't have emotions from it. You don't.

Oh, okay. People cry when they hear some things and I don't get it. Some people don't get computers, I don't get jazz.

That's okay. That's really okay. I can't sit here and tell you that jazz is for every soul.

So you actually could listen to the music that he wrote and say, wow, he was really inspired by God. He was really excited at this point and that point, really? Totally.

Totally. Awesome. It's nice.

Well, but. Good for you. You know what it is?

Yeah, and it's okay if you don't. I mean, for me, it was something that gripped me and it makes me cry when I hear him play. That's great.

Yeah, it's the same, by the way. My hero, CS Lewis says that there's a thread. There's a secret thread that every individual has a kind of unique thread of things that move you.

Music, literature, a landscape, a particular person, a spot on the earth. That, and I was talking before about how Coltrane says, there's also a great Leonard Bernstein quote that I was used. Bernstein said, when he hears Beethoven's fifth, even though he's an atheist, he's basically, I have to believe in God.

Now, everybody's got a little thread of what those things are. And some people's thread don't go through jazz, okay? But the point is that it doesn't determine isolation, so that's good.

Otherwise, I won't be in heaven with you, you know? Everybody's got a thread. Everybody's got a thread.

And by the way, in my case, for example, I was a trumpet player. As tries, I couldn't do jazz. I just couldn't do it.

As a result, I just couldn't, even though at one point I was pretty good. I just couldn't do it. And in my case, it's sort of like, I look at these guys who can do it with a certain kind of awe because I tried.

I appreciate jazz quite a bit, but probably appreciate it a little differently because I'm a failed jazz musician. And therefore, I actually have a certain awe that you don't have. The real point is everybody's got that thread.

For some people, it goes right to the down the center of jazz. For some people, it's mainly jazz. For some people, it's hardly at all.

With my wife, it's pretty much hardly at all. But on the other hand, her thread goes right to downtown Ballet. And I say, hmm.

All right. Yeah. So anyway, but everybody's got a thread.

And that's the thing we've been talking about tonight. Listen, this guy is so well spoken. And a lot of you hear me a lot.

But boy, this has been terrific to have John here tonight. So let's give my hand for being here. Thank you.

我眼里含着泪，非常感谢大家。这对我来说意义重大。外面还有很多需要希望和未来的人。上帝赐福于我去做我喜欢做的事，并且去帮助别人，这也激励了我。

谢谢你们。谢谢。谢谢。你先说吧。

谢谢。我有一个问题，但不是关于音乐的。哦，不。等一下。

我不懂所有的事情，但我对音乐很了解。如果我想的话，我想在科学上有所衡量，还想成为一名教师，但我相信上帝。这其中的一部分与进化有关。如果我不相信进化，却要教它，你会怎么处理这种情况？

幸运的是，我可以非常简短地回答这个问题。您的进化论信仰并不影响您对正统基督教教义的接受。正统基督徒对于进化的看法各不相同。因此，认为某种特定的进化观点与正统基督教相契合是一种误导。

没有它，我就不能成为正统基督徒？这并不正确。现在我不会进一步阐述这一点，但关键在于，在进化论的问题上，人们有不同的看法。所以，我总是建议大家，先弄清楚耶稣是不是上帝的儿子、复活了这些核心问题。

这些问题决定了你的生活方式。如果答案是肯定的，那么你就要这样生活；如果不是，那你就不必如此。你可以选择这样的生活方式，这才是重要的。不要担心进化论的事宜。

等以后再考虑这个问题好了。我有很多非常坚定的基督教朋友，他们对进化的看法几乎涵盖了所有可能的观点。所以不要让这个分散了你的注意力。好的，请问一下您的想法，关于约翰·柯川晚期独奏作品与早期作品的区别，比如《星际空间》之后的作品和之前的作品。

当我听《巨步跨越》或《星际空间》，甚至那个时期的其他作品时，我能感受到他的新概念和他的演奏风格更加成熟。而当我听他后期的一些作品时，并没有这种感觉。我总是觉得这可能与他在同一时期的精神生活有关。虽然我不知道如何描述这一点，因为这是非常个人的事情。

我记得有时会想，我有我的最爱，有些是早期的，有些是晚期的。有时候我觉得，当我以为自己听过他的较新作品并不如最早期的作品时，后来听到了他吹萨克斯的一首曲子。> 这些思考很有启发性。它是在很晚的时候摧毁我的，科尔特兰。

那真是难以置信。那是和艾丽斯·科尔特兰以及他在一起的时候。我不知道可能是拉希德谁来着。我甚至不知道是哪张唱片。

我只是觉得你得去翻找一下，还得听一听。你不能只听一次或者两次就说，嗯，你知道的，我觉得《巨人的步伐》更好一些，因为里面有很多内容。你得有耐心。不过，我确实不能替他说什么，因为他真的走在一条令人惊叹的路上和探寻中，我无法说清他在想些什么。

有时候我真的不得不回头再听听。你知道，我有很多科尔特兰的唱片，很多。但你知道，我会有一段时间听得多一些，然后又远离它一段时间，然后再回来。而他晚期的作品并不是每次我回来听他的时候都会首先去听的东西。

你介意我接着说吗？我只是想问一下，你觉得在那些作品中还能听到同样的组织结构和他在技术上所达到的水平吗？我认为在他整个生命中演奏萨克斯的时候，总是有着天才级别的组织工作。从没有一张唱片是你可以说它不是这样的。

这真是令人难以置信。我们已经说了三十分钟了，有些人可能觉得这个时间差不多该结束了。我觉得你们都在等着，我再回答一个问题就结束吧，抱歉，你先说。那边的那位。

好的，这是一个有趣的问题，也许你会没想到。实际上，当你们在谈论音乐的时候，我没有听懂。我的问题是，对于那些根本不懂爵士乐的人来说，还有希望吗？比如有没有一个三分钟版本的爵士乐给初学者？

这是我的答案。我有一个给你。有人说我不懂爵士乐。好吧，我总是会说，你懂贝多芬或莫扎特吗？

你能理解他们的天才之处吗？你能听出那首音乐并感叹，哇，你不需要去试图理解它，是吧？你只是听着就觉得，哇，这就是爵士乐的感觉。如果你只是听文化，不需要理解他在做什么，你只需要感受其中的情感部分，你可以接受也可以不接受。

对我来说，我没有从这些情感中感受到什么。哦，好吧。人们听到某些事情会哭，我不明白。有些人不懂电脑，我也不懂爵士乐。

这没关系。真的没关系。我不能坐在这里告诉你爵士乐适合每一个灵魂。所以你其实可以听他写的音乐，说：“哇，他真的很受神的启发，在这一点和那一点都很兴奋。

”真的吗？太棒了。好吧，但是。很好，你知道这是什么吗？

是的，如果你不懂也无所谓。对我来说，这是一些触动我的东西，当我听到他演奏时会感动落泪。这也很好。顺便说一句，我的偶像C.S.刘易斯说过，每个人都有一个独特的、能够触动你的秘密线索。

音乐、文学、风景、特定的人、地球上的某个地方。之前我提到过Coltrane的话，还有大衛·辛曼的一句名言我也引用过：当他听到贝多芬的第五交响曲时，尽管他是个无神论者，但他不得不相信上帝的存在。每个人都有这样一条线索。有些人这条线索不经过爵士乐，没关系。

**关键是它不会导致孤立，所以这是好事。**否则，我就不能和你一起在天堂了，你知道吗？每个人都有自己的那条线索。顺便说一句，在我自己的例子中，我是小号手。

我尝试过，但就是做不了爵士乐。即使在我技术还不错的时候也一样做不到。结果，我对这些人的敬佩之情是出于一种敬畏感，因为我曾经试过。虽然我很欣赏爵士乐，但可能因为自己是个失败的爵士音乐家，所以我对它有不同于你的某种敬畏感。

真正重要的是每个人都有这样一条线索。对于一些人来说，爵士乐直接贯穿其中；对另一些人来说，主要是爵士乐；还有一些人几乎听不懂。对我来说，和我妻子相比，我们对爵士乐的理解几乎可以忽略不计。但是另一方面，她的兴趣却直指市中心的芭蕾舞。

我想说，嗯。好吧。是的。总之，但每个人都有自己的兴趣点。

今晚我们一直在谈论的就是这个话题。这位先生说得真好。你们很多人都经常听我讲道。但今晚有约翰来这里真是太棒了。

所以让我们为他的到来鼓掌感谢他。谢谢。感谢大家的到来。感谢大家收听《福音与生活播客》。
