## 引言与经文诵读 / Introduction and Scripture Reading

**Introduction:**

Welcome to Gospel in Life. During January, we're inviting our listeners to consider becoming a Gospel in Life monthly partner. Monthly partners are an important part in helping us to plan for how we can be the most effective in reaching people all over the world with the gospel.

If you'd like to become a monthly partner, just visit gospelinlife.com slash partner. That's gospelinlife.com slash partner. What comes to mind when you hear about the Ten Commandments?

For many people, they bring up feelings of guilt and shame, or they seem like a list of rules that are impossible to follow. In today's sermon, Tim Keller shows us how God didn't give us the Ten Commandments to crush us with unattainable moral standards, but to point us to Jesus Christ, the only one who perfectly fulfills God's law. Jonah chapter 1, verses 1 through 10.

But Jonah was greatly displeased and became angry. He prayed to the Lord, O Lord, is this not what I said when I was still at home? That is why I was so quick to flee to Tarshish.

I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding in love, a God who relents from sending calamity. Now O Lord, take away my life, for it is better for me to die than to live. But the Lord replied, have you any right to be angry?

Jonah went out and sat down at a place east of the city. There he made himself a shelter, sat in its shade and waited to see what would happen to the city. Then the Lord God provided a vine and made it grow over Jonah to give shade for his head to ease his discomfort.

And Jonah was very happy about the vine. But at dawn the next day, at dawn the next day, God provided a worm which chewed the vine so that it withered. When the sun rose, God provided a scorching east wind and the sun blazed on Jonah's head so he grew faint.

He wanted to die and said it would be better for me to die than to live. But God said to Jonah, do you have a right to be angry about the vine? I do, he said.

I am angry enough to die. But the Lord said, you have been concerned about this vine, though you did not tend it or make it grow. It sprang up overnight and died overnight.

But Nineveh has more than 120,000 people who cannot tell their right hand from their left and many cattle as well. Should I not be concerned about that great city? This is the word of the Lord.

**引言：** 欢迎来到福音生活。在一月份，我们邀请听众考虑成为福音生活的月度合作伙伴。月度合作伙伴对于帮助我们规划如何最有效地将福音传递给全世界的人们是非常重要的。如果您想成为月度合作伙伴，只需访问gospelinlife.com/partner.那是gospelinlife.com/partner.当您听到十诫时，您会想到什么？

对许多人来说，它们带来了内疚和羞愧的感觉，或者它们似乎是一份不可能遵循的规则清单。在今天的讲道中，提姆·凯勒向我们展示了神并没有给我们十诫来用无法实现的道德标准压垮我们，而是指向耶稣基督，唯一完美履行神律法的人。约拿书第一章，第一到十节。但约拿大大不悦，且甚发怒。

他祷告耶和华说：“耶和华啊，我在本国的时候，岂不是这样说吗？我知道你是有恩典、有怜悯的神，不轻易发怒，有丰盛的慈爱，并且后悔不降所说的灾。我知道你是有恩典、有怜悯的神，不轻易发怒，有丰盛的慈爱，并且后悔不降所说的灾。耶和华啊，现在求你取我的命吧！

因为我死了比活着还好。”耶和华说：“你这样发怒合乎理吗？”于是约拿出城，坐在城的东边，在那里为自己搭了一座棚，坐在棚的荫下，要看看那城究竟如何。耶和华神安排了一棵蓖麻，使其发生高过约拿，影儿遮住他的头，救他脱离苦楚。

约拿因这棵蓖麻大大喜乐。次日黎明，神却安排一条虫子咬这蓖麻，以致枯槁。日头出来的时候，神安排炎热的东风，日头曝晒约拿的头，使他发昏。他就为自己求死，说：“我死了比活着还好。

”神对约拿说：“你因这棵蓖麻发怒合乎理吗？”他说：“我发怒以至于死，都合乎理。”耶和华说：“这蓖麻不是你栽种的，也不是你培养的；一夜发生，一夜干死，你尚且爱惜；何况这尼尼微大城，其中不能分辨左手右手的有十二万多人，并有许多牲畜，我岂能不爱惜呢？”这是耶和华的话。

## 自己绑架案的共谋者 / Co-Conspirators in Our Own Kidnapping

**The Co-Conspirator in Her Own Kidnapping:**

1974, Patty Hearst, remember? Nineteen years old, millionaire heiress or heiress of a fortune, the Hearst newspaper fortune, was kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army, I remembered. And within just a few weeks, her life was so empty that within a few weeks they were able to take the cuffs off of her and they were able to take off the ropes and to take off the guards and she joined them and she took the name Tonya and she was involved in a bank robbery in which a woman was killed.

By the way, it was a woman, a Seventh-day Adventist woman, who was just depositing the weekly offerings at the bank and that group blew her away. And what was so intriguing about this is that Patty Hearst became a co-conspirator in her own kidnapping. She became enamored with her jailers and after a while they could take the cuffs off because her idolization of her jailers was her chain.

And whenever anybody tried to free her or liberate her, she sneered and snarled at them. She was a co-conspirator in her own kidnapping.

**自己绑架案的共谋者：** 1974年，帕蒂·赫斯特，记得吗？十九岁，百万富翁报业继承人，被辛比奥尼斯解放军绑架，我记得。仅仅几周后，她的生活如此空虚，以至于在几周内他们就能解开她的手铐，解开她的绳索，解开她的守卫，她加入了他们，并取名为托尼娅，并参与了一次银行抢劫，其中一名妇女被杀。顺便说一下，那是一名妇女，一名基督复临安息日会的妇女，她只是在银行存入每周的奉献，而那个团体就把她打死了。

令人着迷的是，帕蒂·赫斯特成为了自己绑架案的共谋者。她对她的监禁者产生了迷恋，过了一段时间，他们可以解开她的手铐，因为她对她的监禁者的偶像崇拜就是她的枷锁。每当有人试图解放她或解救她时，她对他们嗤之以鼻。她是自己绑架案的共谋者。

## 约拿的案例：好的爱变成偶像 / Jonah's Case Study: When Good Love Becomes an Idol

**Jonah's Story - A Case Study:**

Jonah was an extremely prominent religious figure in his day.

He might have been the leading prophet and preacher and religious figure in Israel. And when we meet him here, he has just gone to Nineveh, which was the New York City of the era. It was the capital of the world.

It was the largest city of the largest and most important empire in the whole world, Assyria. And he goes there and he's done a preaching campaign and the entire city is turned to God in repentance, led by the king himself. And that's what we read in chapter 3.

And certainly we would expect that at the end of chapter 3, it only goes to verse 10, but we would have expected that Jonah, the book of Jonah, would have ended at chapter 3, verse 11. And chapter 3, verse 11 would have read like this. And Jonah went home to his own home rejoicing, right?

But instead we read verse 1 that says, he was exceedingly angry. Now here's a question. What had gotten Jonah, this great prophet, so tied up in knots, so messed up inside that he is suicidal?

He says, I'm ready to die. I don't have any purpose in life anymore. What could have so distorted his vision that he couldn't rejoice in this great triumph, not just of the kingdom of God, but of his own career?

What had this man so controlled and tied up in knots? Well, we'll talk about that in a minute. But just for a moment, let's realize what the principle is.

Because this, we're not here today to talk about Jonah, we're here to talk about you and me. Jonah was a co-conspirator in his own kidnapping. When God came to him a couple of times to try to liberate Jonah, he sneered and he snarled at him.

In all of our lives, we have little lords, small l, little gods, pseudo gods, idols, things that we worship. And we're bound by those things. They control our lives and we're co-conspirators on our own kidnapping.

We're bound by them. And if somebody tries to come in and liberate us from them or talk to us about them, we snarl at them. Because you see, the fact that we're enamored with them, it's our very adoration, our idolization of them is what binds us.

God, in his grace, seeks to liberate us and he seeks to liberate us with the most liberating of all the commandments of the Ten Commandments, which is what we're looking at today. The first, I am the Lord thy God, he says, thou shalt have no other gods before me. What he's saying there is, I'm the only God there is.

All others are imposters. My yoke is easy. My burden is light.

And the yoke of any other God is bondage. Or as John Donne put it, and we printed this little classic quote by the Christian minister John Donne in the front of the bulletin, take me to you, imprison me. He's talking to God.

Take me to you, imprison me. For I, except you enthrall me, never shall be free, nor ever chaste, except you ravish me. That's what the first commandment's about.

If you have any other gods before God, and we all do, to that degree that we have got other gods before him, we're in bondage, co-conspirators with our own jailers. Now, let's take a look at Jonah. I said let's step away from Jonah for a minute, but now let's look at him because Jonah is a case study.

And those of you from law school, from business school, from medical school, a lot of different schools use case studies. It's one of the best ways to learn principles, so let's use Jonah. Let's use his case study and let's look at it and tear it apart.

Let's break it down. First thing we see is in the first three verses, though Jonah does not yet detect the idol controlling his life, his heart idol, we can detect it. But Jonah was greatly displeased and became angry.

He prayed to the Lord, O Lord, is not this what I said when I was still at home? That is why I was so quick to flee away to Tarshish the first time you called me to go to Nineveh. I knew you were a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger, abounding in love, who relents from sending calamity.

Now, O Lord, take away my life. It's better for me to die than to live. What is going on?

Let's recap the setting. If you want to get the hang of what Jonah has done, he has gone to the greatest city in the world, the mortal enemy of Israel. Here he, an Israelite prophet, goes and calls everyone to repentance and to turn to the God of Israel, and they do.

And the king sends out a royal decree and calls everyone from the poorest to the richest to bow their knee to God. Now, if you want to get the hang of what that kind of accomplishment that was, you have to recognize it would be something like if the mayor and the city council of New York called everybody to Times Square for a prayer meeting and said, we've got to repent for the sin of this city. Let's get down on our knees.

Are you getting the hang of the accomplishment? Are you getting the hang of what actually happened? But Jonah is ready to slit his wrists.

Why? Jonah was proud of his nationality. He was proud of his people.

He was proud of his heritage. But the pride in his people had gone wrong. You see, because he was proud of his people, he was deeply concerned for the national security of Israel.

And yet this good thing, this love for his people, had become racism. Because what is he complaining about? He's saying, I knew that this might happen.

Lord God, I knew you're the kind of God that relents from sending calamity. I wanted these dirty Assyrians to be wiped off the map. And I was afraid of this.

I knew that you have this bad habit of forgiving people. Look at it. I knew you were a compassionate God.

This is the reason I get so upset the first time. You see, his natural and good love for his own people had become racism because he wanted the annihilation of his enemies, not the rehabilitation of his enemies. And I'll tell you what had happened.

What had happened was it had become racism because that love for God had turned into an idol. He now got his identity from his Jewishness, his identity from his national heritage. Because when he says, I am angry enough to die, that means what?

It means that his real purpose in life was gone. Now that Israel's national security was not secure. He says, now that's the thing, obviously, he was living for.

Because he says, now my life has no meaning. I have no purpose. I'm ready to go.

I'm ready to die. You see, even though he had said, I believe in God, he served God as long as he could use God for his real purpose. And his real purpose, his real goal, his real God was the political interests of Israel.

And as long as serving God fit in with that goal, he looked very religious. But as soon as God called him to do something that went against his real goal and his real God, suddenly Jonah screamed out what God was telling him. And he said, I won't do it.

Now friends, we've all got those screens. We've all got those screens. What are we talking about?

If there's anything in your life that you say, Lord, I believe in you, but I've got to have that to be happy. And if you don't give me that, our relationship is negotiable. Now, most of us are hiding from ourselves and we're so subtle about this that we can't even say that very consciously.

I've heard people say it right in front of me. I mean, and most people know you never say that in front of a professional Christian type. But a lot of you won't even say it in front of yourselves.

And yet you're saying it. We have certain non-negotiable things in our lives we must have. We must have a certain level of financial security or we must have a certain level of approval and popularity or we must have a certain level of certainty.

We have to have those things. And if those things are not there or if those things are even threatened, we experience a loss of meaning in life. Right?

We start to say, what am I really living for? We experience that emptiness, that loss of meaning in life, which shows that those are really our gods, not him. We say, I am angry.

Yes, I'm angry. Enough to die.

**约拿的故事——案例研究：** 约拿在他那个时代是一个极其著名的宗教人物。他可能是以色列的首席先知、传道人和宗教领袖。当我们在这里遇到他时，他刚刚去了尼尼微，那是那个时代的纽约市。它是世界的首都，是世界上最大、最重要的帝国亚述的最大城市。

他去了那里，进行了布道活动，整个城市在国王的带领下悔改归向神。这就是我们在第三章中读到的。当然，我们会期望在第三章结束时，它只到第十节，但我们本来期望约拿书会在第三章第十一节结束。第三章第十一节本来会这样写：约拿回到自己的家中，欢欣鼓舞，对吧？

但相反，我们读到第一节说，他非常生气。现在有一个问题。是什么让约拿，这位伟大的先知，如此纠结，以至于他想自杀？他说，我准备死了。

我再也没有生活的意义了。是什么让他的视野如此扭曲，以至于他不能为这个伟大的胜利而欢欣鼓舞，不仅是神国的胜利，也是他自己事业的胜利？是什么让这个人如此受控和纠结？好吧，我们稍后会谈到这个。

但暂时，让我们意识到这个原则。因为今天我们不是来谈论约拿的，我们是来谈论你和我的。约拿是自己绑架案的共谋者。当神几次来试图解放约拿时，他对他嗤之以鼻。

在我们所有的生活中，我们都有小主，小写的l,小神，伪神，我们崇拜的东西。我们被这些东西束缚。它们控制我们的生活，我们是自己绑架案的共谋者。我们被它们束缚。

如果有人试图来解放我们或与我们谈论它们，我们对他们嗤之以鼻。因为你看，我们对它们的迷恋，正是我们的崇拜，我们对它们的偶像崇拜束缚了我们。神以他的恩典，试图解放我们，他试图用十诫中最解放的诫命来解放我们，这就是我们今天要看的。第一条，我是耶和华你的神，他说，除了我以外，你不可有别的神。

他在这里说的是，我是唯一的神，其他都是冒牌货。我的轭是容易的，我的担子是轻省的。任何其他神的轭都是束缚。或者正如约翰·邓恩所说的，我们在公告的前面印了这位基督教牧师约翰·邓恩的经典名言，把我带给你，囚禁我。

他在对神说话。把我带给你，囚禁我。因为我，除非你吸引我，否则永远不会自由，也永远不会贞洁，除非你征服我。这就是第一条诫命的意义。

如果你在神面前有任何其他神，而我们都有，那么在某种程度上，我们在神面前有其他神，我们就在束缚中，和我们的监禁者共谋。现在，让我们看看约拿。我说让我们暂时离开约拿，但现在让我们看看他，因为约拿是一个案例研究。你们中那些来自法学院、商学院、医学院的人，很多不同的学校都使用案例研究。

这是学习原则的最佳方法之一，所以让我们使用约拿。让我们使用他的案例研究，让我们看看它，拆解它。我们首先看到的是在前三节，虽然约拿还没有察觉到控制他生活的偶像，他心中的偶像，但我们可以察觉到。但约拿大大不悦，且甚发怒。

他祷告耶和华说：“耶和华啊，我在本国的时候，岂不是这样说吗？这就是为什么我第一次你召我去尼尼微时，我急忙逃往他施。我知道你是有恩典、有怜悯的神，不轻易发怒，有丰盛的慈爱，并且后悔不降所说的灾。耶和华啊，现在求你取我的命吧！

因为我死了比活着还好。”发生了什么？让我们回顾一下背景。如果你想了解约拿所做的事情，他去了世界上最大的城市，以色列的死敌。

在这里，他，一个以色列先知，去呼召每个人悔改，归向以色列的神，他们做到了。国王发出皇家诏令，呼召从最贫穷到最富有的人向神屈膝。现在，如果你想了解那种成就，你必须认识到这就像是纽约市的市长和市议会呼召所有人到时代广场参加祷告会，并说，我们必须为这座城市的罪悔改。让我们跪下。

你明白成就的意义了吗？你明白实际发生了什么吗？但约拿准备割腕。为什么？

约拿为他的民族感到自豪。他为他的人民感到自豪。他为他的遗产感到自豪。但对他人民的自豪感出了问题。

你看，因为他为他的人民感到自豪，他非常关心以色列的国家安全。然而，这种对他人民的爱已经变成了种族主义。因为他在抱怨什么？他说，我知道这可能会发生。

主神，我知道你是那种从不降灾的神。我希望这些肮脏的亚述人被从地图上抹去。我害怕这一点。我知道你有这个坏习惯，原谅人。

看看它。我知道你是有怜悯的神。这就是我第一次如此生气的原因。你看，他对自己人民的自然和良好的爱已经变成了种族主义，因为他想要的是敌人的消灭，而不是敌人的康复。

我会告诉你发生了什么。发生的是它变成了种族主义，因为对神的爱已经变成了偶像。他现在从他的犹太身份中获得了他的身份，从他的民族遗产中获得了他的身份。因为当他说，我生气到想死，这意味着什么？

**这意味着他的真实生活目的已经消失。**现在以色列的国家安全不再安全。他说，现在这就是显然他为之而活的事情。因为他说，现在我的生活没有意义。

我没有目的。我准备好了。我准备死了。你看，尽管他说，我相信神，只要他能用神来实现他的真正目的，他就侍奉神。

而他的真正目的，他的真正目标，他的真正神是以色列的政治利益。只要侍奉神符合那个目标，他看起来就非常虔诚。但一旦神召他去做一些违背他真正目标和真正神的事情，突然约拿尖叫着神告诉他。他说，我不做。

现在朋友们，我们都有那些尖叫。我们在谈论什么？如果你的生活中有任何事情，你说，主，我相信你，但我必须拥有那个才能快乐。如果你不给我那个，我们的关系是可以谈判的。

现在，我们大多数人都在自己面前隐藏，我们对此非常微妙，以至于我们甚至不能非常有意识地说出那句话。我听过有人在我面前说过。我是说，大多数人知道你永远不会在专业基督徒面前说那句话。但你们中的许多人甚至不会在自己面前说。

但你在说。我们生活中有某些不可谈判的东西，我们必须拥有。我们必须有一定水平的财务安全，或者我们必须有一定水平的认可和受欢迎程度，或者我们必须有一定水平的确定性。我们必须拥有这些东西。

如果这些东西不存在，或者如果这些东西甚至受到威胁，我们就会体验到生活意义的丧失。对吗？我们开始说，我到底在为什么而活？我们体验到那种空虚，那种生活意义的丧失，这表明那些实际上是我们的神，而不是他。

我们说，我生气。是的，我生气。生气到想死。

## 偶像的无穷多样性 / The Infinite Variety of Idols

**The Variety of Idols:**

Now, my friends, everybody's idols are different.

There's an infinite variety. And some people have asked a great question, where do they come from? Now, not tonight, but the next couple of weeks in the evening service, I'm actually going to get into that in some detail.

Some people say, well, our idols are fixed from our childhood. And by the way, I'm not sure that's wrong. But the only thing we've got to talk about here is the Bible says that we've all got them.

Romans chapter 1 says, everybody, everybody, lifts up something created and gives glory to it instead of the creator. And that means somewhere, for whatever reasons, for all sorts of complex reasons that probably have to do with heredity and environment and that sort of thing, we've latched onto certain things. Deep down at some level of our being, we say to ourselves, if I have that, I'll be safe.

If I achieve that, I can feel good about myself. If I achieve that, I have a worthwhile life. And if I don't have these things, I'm angry enough to die.

And you see, our idols are very different, very different. You nervous types, you need certainty. And you can't live with risk.

And when the risk comes in, you lose everything because you've got to have certainty. You relational types, you've got to have approval. And you can't live with disapproval.

You don't mind uncertainty as long as you've got people there telling you, I love you. You achiever types, you can't live with failure. You don't mind people not liking you as long as you know you've achieved.

And we look down our noses at each other if the other person has a different idol than us. When people come into the Christian faith, if they cross the line and they receive Christ as Savior, they begin to see what is expected of a Christian. And it's so interesting to see how different people's reactions are to the things the Bible requires.

One of the first things you learn, the Bible says, is you must give of your substance to the Lord's work and to the needs of people. You must tithe. It's fascinating to see that some people come on in and when they read that, they say, that's a great idea, you're right, that's good, I'll do it.

And other people have apoplexy. Then there's another thing that the Bible says, and that is, Jesus says, if you deny me before men, I will deny you before my Father. In other words, you should be willing to speak up, to open your mouth, to identify yourself as a Christian to your friends.

You should speak up for him. Some people, they become Christians, they get in and they read that and some people say, that's right, that's good, I'll do it. And other people have apoplexy.

And very often they're different people than the ones who had apoplexy about the tithing. And we looked at our nose at each other, but it's just idols. Our idols are different, don't you see?

Certain things control us and they all are different. But whatever our God is, as this great quote by Becky Pippert says, that God controls us. We all chase things like success, true love, or the perfect life.

Good things that can easily become ultimate things. When we put our faith in them, deep down, we know they can't satisfy our deepest longings. The truth is that we've made lesser gods of good things, things that can't give us what we really need.

In his book, Counterfeit Gods, the empty promises of money, sex, and power, and the only hope that matters, Tim Keller shows us how a proper understanding of the Bible reveals the truth about societal ideals in our own hearts and shows us that there is only one God who can wholly satisfy our desires. This month, we'll send you Counterfeit Gods as our thank you for your gift to help Gospel and Life share the love of Christ with people all over the world. You can request your copy at gospelandlife.com slash give.

That's gospelandlife.com slash give. Now here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching.

Becky Pippert, in her book, Out of the Salt Shaker, writes, whatever controls you, whatever controls us is our Lord. The person who seeks power is controlled by power. The person who seeks acceptance is controlled by the people who he or she wants to please.

We do not control ourselves. We are controlled by the Lord of our life. If Jesus is our Lord, then he is the one who controls.

He has the ultimate power. There are no bargains. Can you detect the things in your life that are controlling you?

The things that you must have? The things that are probably before the Lord and that have to be removed if you're ever going to experience freedom?

**偶像的多样性：** 现在，我的朋友们，每个人的偶像都不同。

有无数种类。有些人提出了一个很好的问题，它们从哪里来？现在不是今晚，但接下来的几个星期的晚上崇拜，我实际上会详细讨论这个问题。有些人说，我们的偶像是从童年固定下来的。

顺便说一句，我不确定这是否错误。但我们唯一需要谈论的是圣经说我们都有它们。罗马书第一章说，每个人，每个人都抬高某些受造物，并将荣耀归给它，而不是造物主。**这意味着在某种程度上，无论出于何种原因，由于所有复杂的原因，可能与遗传和环境有关，我们已经抓住了某些东西。**

在我们存在的某个深层次，我们对自己说，如果我有那个，我就安全了。如果我实现了那个，我就可以对自己感到满意。如果我实现了那个，我就有一个有价值的生活。如果我没有这些东西，我生气到想死。

你看，我们的偶像非常不同，非常不同。你们这些紧张类型的人，你们需要确定性。你们不能忍受风险。当风险出现时，你们失去了一切，因为你们必须有确定性。

你们这些关系类型的人，你们必须有认可。你们不能忍受不被认可。只要有别人告诉你，我爱你，你就不介意不确定性。你们这些成就类型的人，你们不能忍受失败。

只要你知道你已经取得成就，你就不介意别人不喜欢你。我们看不起其他人，如果其他人的偶像与我们不同。当人们进入基督教信仰时，如果他们跨过界线并接受基督为救主，他们开始看到基督徒的期望是什么。看到圣经要求的事情，人们的反应是如此不同，这很有趣。

你学到的第一件事是，圣经说，你必须将你的财物奉献给主的工作和他人的需要。你必须奉献。看到有些人进来，当他们读到这一点时，他们说，这是个好主意，你是对的，这很好，我会做的。而其他人则大发雷霆。

然后圣经说的另一件事是，耶稣说，如果你在人面前否认我，我将在我父面前否认你。换句话说，你应该愿意在你的朋友面前开口，表明自己是基督徒。你应该为他发声。有些人，他们成为基督徒，他们进来，他们读到这一点，有些人说，这是对的，这很好，我会做的。

而其他人则大发雷霆。通常他们与那些对奉献大发雷霆的人不同。我们看不起对方，但这只是偶像。我们的偶像不同，你不明白吗？

某些东西控制着我们，它们都是不同的。但无论我们的神是什么，正如贝基·皮普特的这句名言所说，那神控制着我们。我们都追逐成功、真爱或完美生活之类的东西。好的东西很容易变成终极的东西。

当我们把信仰放在它们上面时，内心深处，我们知道它们无法满足我们最深的渴望。事实是，我们把好的东西变成了次等的神，这些东西无法给我们真正需要的东西。在他的书《虚假神：金钱、性与权力的空虚承诺以及唯一重要的希望》中，提姆·凯勒向我们展示了对圣经的正确理解如何揭示社会理想和我们内心的真相，并向我们展示只有一个神可以完全满足我们的欲望。本月，我们将赠送《虚假神》作为您对福音生活的捐赠的感谢。

您可以在gospelandlife.com/give请求您的副本。那是gospelandlife.com/give.现在是凯勒博士带来的今天讲道的其余部分。贝基·皮普特在她的书《盐瓶之外》中写道，无论控制我们什么，控制我们的是我们的主。寻求权力的人被权力控制。

寻求接受的人被他或她想取悦的人控制。我们不控制自己。我们被我们生活的主控制。如果耶稣是我们的主，那么他就是控制我们的人。

他拥有最终的权力。没有讨价还价。你能察觉到你生活中控制你的东西吗？你必须拥有的东西？

那些可能在主之前的东西，如果你想要体验自由，就必须去除的东西？

## 神如何揭露并移除偶像 / How God Exposes and Removes Our Idols

**God Reveals Our Idols:**

Now, Jonah doesn't see his, but God turns around and begins to help him see it.

And we see from verses 4 all the way down through verse 9, God goes into a kind of program, a campaign, through which he's trying to reveal to Jonah his idol. Now, the reason God does that is because until you recognize what your idols are, they will sap you. Anything you add to Jesus Christ as a requirement for being happy is an idol that will sap you.

It will kill you. Anything that you add to Jesus Christ as a requirement to be happy. When God sees us saying at some level of our life, I can't live without that, he knows then we can't live with it.

And he's got to remove it. Why? He's got to remove it because it's the only way to freedom.

My friends, how can you possibly be free from any fear of loss of power or loss of popularity or loss of love or loss of certainty or loss of status? How can you be free from that? Only if you get rid of all the things that are before him, all the other gods.

He wants, he is committed. He is committed to liberating you so that you can weather any change, so that you can look any situation or condition in the face. And only by pushing you to pure and pure and more exclusive devotion to him can he ever bring you to that place.

Don't you see? So he's got to do it. Now he comes to Jonah the first time and he says in verse 4, do you have a right to be angry?

He's asking Jonah to look deeper than his anger. What God does here is he's saying, Jonah, look, what is making you angry? What is the basis for it?

Look deeper than your anger, Jonah, and see what is it that's driving me? But Jonah doesn't do it. And frankly, very few of us do it the first time.

God, thank you, Lord, does not come to us once or we'd all be dead meat. Unfortunately, the first time he comes to Jonah very gently, and unfortunately for most of us, he comes to us very gently. In fact, if right now God is putting his finger on something in your life through this worship service, I can assure you that's a gentle approach.

And if you don't get it, God loves you too much to let you go. And what he has to do here with Jonah is he goes a step further. He brings into Jonah's life a comfort, a vine.

Now you might say, well, that's nice. But you have to realize that in a place like the desert of Palestine, this was a great comfort. God brings it up, lets Jonah's heart get attached to it, and then he removes it.

Very often God does the very same thing for us. He pulls things out of our lives that we love. He pulls things out of our lives that we're leaning on.

Why? Because he enjoys to see us squirm? No, he doesn't like that at all.

He hates to see us in pain. But he's like the lumberjacks. Two lumberjacks came into a forest, and they were about to cut all the trees down.

And they looked up and they noticed that there were two birds beginning to make a nest in one of the trees. So what they did was they took not the cutting part of the ax, but the flat part of the ax, and they socked the tree and shook the tree until the birds up there were getting their heads rattled around. And finally, the birds moved and flew away to the next tree.

But the lumberjacks didn't want them to stop there. That tree was going to come down too, so they socked that tree. And they rattled the poor birds around until they moved to the next tree.

And they continually rattled the birds in the next tree and rattled the birds in the next tree until finally the birds started building their nest on a rock. Now friends, don't you see things that have been happening in your life that perhaps you've been pretty angry at God for? And what he's saying to you is, this tree is coming down.

This thing that you build your life on, this thing that you say you must have to be happy, don't you realize you will never be free? You will never be free from ups and downs. You'll never have lasting, infallible, unassailable certainty and joy until you build your nest in some tree that's not coming down, that's me.

**神揭示我们的偶像：** 现在，约拿没有看到他的偶像，但神转过来开始帮助他看到它。我们从第4节一直到第9节看到，神进入了一种计划，通过这种计划，他试图向约拿揭示他的偶像。神这样做的原因是因为除非你认识到你的偶像是什么，否则它们会消耗你。

任何你加到耶稣基督上的东西作为快乐的要求都是一个会消耗你的偶像。它会杀了你。任何你加到耶稣基督上的东西作为快乐的要求。当神看到我们在生活的某个层面上说，我不能没有那个，他知道我们不能和它一起生活。

他必须去除它。为什么？他必须去除它，因为这是通往自由的唯一途径。我的朋友们，你怎么可能从失去权力或失去受欢迎程度或失去爱或失去确定性或失去地位的任何恐惧中解放出来？

只有当你去除所有在他面前的东西，所有其他的神时，他才会解放你，使你能够经受任何变化，使你能够面对任何情况或条件。只有通过推动你对他的纯粹和更纯粹和更排他性的奉献，他才能将你带到那个地方。你不明白吗？所以他必须这样做。

现在他第一次来到约拿面前，他在第4节中说，你有权生气吗？他在要求约拿看得比他的愤怒更深。神在这里所做的是，他在说，约拿，看，是什么让你生气？是什么基础？

看得比你的愤怒更深，约拿，看看是什么驱动着我。但约拿没有这样做。坦率地说，我们中的大多数人第一次都不会这样做。感谢主，主不会只来找我们一次，否则我们都会死。

不幸的是，他第一次非常温和地来到约拿面前，不幸的是，对我们大多数人来说，他第一次非常温和地来到我们面前。事实上，如果现在神通过这次敬拜服务在你的生活中指出某些东西，我可以向你保证，那是温和的方法。如果你不明白，神爱你太多了，不会让你走。他在这里对约拿所做的是，他更进一步。

他在约拿的生活中带来了一个安慰，一棵葡萄树。你可能会说，那很好。但你必须意识到，在像巴勒斯坦这样的沙漠中，这是一种巨大的安慰。神让它长出来，让约拿的心依附于它，然后他把它去掉。

神经常为我们做同样的事情。他从我们的生活中抽走我们爱的东西。他从我们的生活中抽走我们依赖的东西。为什么？

因为他喜欢看到我们扭动吗？不，他一点也不喜欢。他讨厌看到我们痛苦。但他就像伐木工人。

两个伐木工人进入一片森林，他们准备砍掉所有的树。他们抬头看到有两只鸟开始在一棵树上筑巢。所以他们所做的是，他们没有用斧头的切割部分，而是用斧头的平面部分，他们猛击树，摇动树，直到上面的鸟被摇晃得头晕目眩。最后，鸟儿们搬走了，飞到了下一棵树上。

但伐木工人不想让它们停在那里。那棵树也要被砍掉，所以他们猛击那棵树。他们摇晃可怜的鸟儿，直到它们搬到下一棵树上。他们不断地摇晃下一棵树上的鸟儿，直到最后，鸟儿们开始在岩石上筑巢。

现在朋友们，你不明白生活中发生的事情，也许你对神非常生气，而他在对你说，这棵树要倒了。这个你建立生活的东西，这个你说你必须拥有才能快乐的东西，你不明白你永远不会自由吗？你永远不会从起伏中解放出来。你永远不会有持久的、无懈可击的、无可争议的确定性和喜悦，直到你在某棵不会倒的树上筑巢，那就是我。

## 亚伯拉罕和以撒：走上山 / Abraham and Isaac: Walking Up the Mountain

**Abraham and Isaac - Walking Up the Mountain:**

Abraham and Isaac. Abraham had become the love slave of his son. He loved his son.

It often happens sometimes to a child that's born to someone in old age. And he was totally the love slave of his son. That meant when Isaac was happy, he was happy.

If something was wrong with Isaac, he was dashed. And God had to do something about that. So he comes to Abraham and says, I want you to slay Isaac as a sacrifice on the mount for me.

And we're told both in Genesis and in the book of Hebrews that Abraham wrestled and wrestled. And you can imagine his agony until finally, the book of Hebrews tells us, he got up in the morning and said, well, I guess God will have to just raise him from the dead. I guess that's what God's going to do.

I'm going to kill him and then God will raise him from the dead. Now, it's very typical that when you try to figure out when God is shaking your life up, if you try to figure out what he's doing, you won't get it right because Abraham was wrong. But you can be sure about the why.

And you've got to proclaim it again and again. And that is he is pushing me to pure devotion. At the end, when he lifted the dagger over Isaac's heart, God said, no, now I know that you love me.

Now you've removed that idol from between you and me. Now I know that you love me because you did not withhold your son, your only son whom you love for me. And listen to this.

The only things that God wants you to walk up the mountain with are Isaac's, things that are probably good in themselves, achievement, desire for friendship, desire for a spouse. What's wrong with those things? Nothing.

And yet God says they're Isaac's. Walk up the mountain. And you say, yes, well, are you going to take them out of my life or are you going to put it back in my life?

That's not your job. The offering, the act of offering, cleanses you and frees you. After all, remember when the angel showed up to Mary, the mother of Jesus, and said, Mary, you're going to become pregnant with Jesus.

You're going to become pregnant out of wedlock. You're going to have into your life a child that's actually the son of God. And all Mary wanted was a normal life.

All Mary wanted was a decent reputation. And when God came and called her away from those things, did she say, I'm angry enough to die? She said, let it be unto me according to thy will.

And was she the worst for that?

**亚伯拉罕和以撒——走上山：** 亚伯拉罕和以撒。亚伯拉罕已经成为他儿子的爱情奴隶。他爱他的儿子。有时发生在一个人在老年时生下的孩子身上。

他完全是他儿子的爱情奴隶。**这意味着当以撒快乐时，他就快乐。**如果以撒有什么问题，他就沮丧。神必须对此做些什么。

所以他来到亚伯拉罕面前说，我要你把以撒作为祭物献给我。我们在创世纪和希伯来书中都被告知，亚伯拉罕挣扎和挣扎，你可以想象他的痛苦，直到最后，希伯来书告诉我们，他早上起来说，好吧，我想神只好让他从死里复活。我想这就是神要做的。我会杀了他，然后神会让他从死里复活。

现在，当你试图弄清楚当神在动摇你的生活时，他在做什么时，这是非常典型的，如果你试图弄清楚他在做什么，你不会弄对，因为亚伯拉罕错了。但你可以确定原因。你必须一遍又一遍地宣告，那就是他在推动我对他的纯粹奉献。最后，当他把匕首举过以撒的心脏时，神说，不，现在我知道你爱我。

现在你已经移除了你和我之间的偶像。现在我知道你爱我，因为你没有为我保留你的儿子，你唯一的儿子，你所爱的儿子。听听这个。神要你带上山的唯一东西是以撒，可能本身是好的东西，成就，对友谊的渴望，对配偶的渴望。

这些东西有什么问题吗？没有。然而神说它们是以撒。走上山。

你说，是的，好吧，你要把它们从我的生活中拿走，还是你要把它放回我的生活中？那不是你的工作。奉献的行为净化你，使你自由。毕竟，记得当天使出现在玛丽面前，耶稣的母亲，并说，玛丽，你将怀上耶稣。

你将未婚先孕。你将有一个孩子进入你的生活，这实际上是神的儿子。玛丽只想要一个正常的生活。玛丽只想要一个体面的名声。

当神来召她离开那些东西时，她说，我生气到想死吗？她说，愿照你的旨意成就在我身上。她因此而变得更糟吗？

## 放弃虚假的神 / Abandoning the False Gods

**Abandoning the False Gods:**

Now the last thing, how do you actually abandon those gods? How did Jonah do it?

We don't know. You know, one of the frustrating things about the book is that it ends. God is confronting Jonah with his idolatry and his racism and he's confronting Jonah and the book ends.

And everybody says, what happened? And does anybody know? Sure we know.

Where do you think we got the book from? Nobody could have possibly given us a story but Jonah himself. And nobody would ever write a book that made him look so bad, except the man who had been so humbled, he was free from his need for approval.

He was free from his need to look good. He was cleansed. He was purified.

He had removed every other idol from his life. Now the other thing you have to recognize, not only is it possible, but it's a process. Friends, it is a process.

If you read the whole book of Jonah, you realize that this is the second time this happened. The first time is the famous time. God called Jonah to go to Nineveh and he left the other direction.

He was swallowed by a fish and in the fish he repents. And he says at the end of chapter 2, he says, those who cling to worthless idols, now he's thinking of the Assyrians, forsake the mercy that could be theirs. Forsake their own mercy.

When he was in the fish, he realized that the grace of God was so great that it was the same to respectable Jews as to dirty idol-worshipping pagans. And he suddenly realized the grace of God was absolutely free. And that is the gospel.

That no matter how respectable you are, no matter how much of a criminal in the gutter you are, you stand in the same place. No one is good, no not one, anyone can be saved if they humbly ask for the grace of Jesus Christ who died for us. When Jonah recognized that at the end of chapter 2, when he said salvation is of the Lord, when he says it's not of my ethnic group, when he says it's not of me and my moral standards, when he says salvation is of the Lord, his racism was healed and he took off for Nineveh.

But when he saw Nineveh being spared, it came back. And I want you to realize that when you become a Christian, you really do a good number on your sins and you say nothing else between me and God, but after you become a Christian, you find that those same sins very often will bounce back. You feel like I cut that tree down, but lo and behold, a shoot comes up out of the stump.

Then you dig up the stump. It's gone and next thing you know, there's roots out there and those roots will bring up a little shoot here and there. You'll spend all of your life going back and having to say, I thought I dealt with that idol and it's back.

And it will continually come back, but every time you'll deal with another blow and another blow and another blow. Those of you who make an idol of approval and love, you thought you dealt with it a year ago, but now you're going to have to come back and you're going to have to take the gospel, the gospel of grace, and you're going to have to say, the only love I really need is the one love that I cannot lose. Those of you who need certainty, you've got to screw the gospel down in your heart and say the only certainty I really need is the one certainty I cannot lose.

And that is that I'm accepted by the free grace of Jesus Christ. That's what you've got to do. That's what you've got to continually do.

**放弃虚假的神：** 现在最后一件事，你如何真正放弃那些神？

约拿是怎么做到的？我们不知道。你知道，这本书令人沮丧的地方在于它结束了。神正在与约拿的偶像崇拜和种族主义对峙，他正在与约拿对峙，书就结束了。

每个人都说，发生了什么？有人知道吗？当然我们知道。你认为我们从哪里得到这本书的？

没有人可能给我们这个故事，除了约拿本人。没有人会写一本让他看起来如此糟糕的书，除非这个人已经被如此谦卑，他已经摆脱了对认可的需求。他已经被净化。他已经被净化。

他已经移除了他生活中的每一个偶像。现在你必须认识到的另一件事，不仅是可能的，而且是一个过程。朋友们，这是一个过程。如果你读完整本约拿书，你会意识到这是第二次发生。

第一次是著名的时间。神召约拿去尼尼微，他往相反的方向走。他被一条鱼吞下，在鱼中他悔改。他在第二章的结尾说，那些依靠虚无偶像的人，现在他在想亚述人，放弃了本可以属于他们的怜悯。

放弃了他们自己的怜悯。当他在鱼中时，他意识到神的恩典是如此伟大，以至于对尊贵的犹太人和肮脏的拜偶像的异教徒都是一样的。他突然意识到神的恩典是完全免费的。这就是福音。

无论你多么尊贵，无论你是多么的罪犯，你都站在同一个地方。没有人是好的，没有一个人，只要他们谦卑地请求耶稣基督的恩典，任何人都可以得救。当约拿在第二章的结尾认识到这一点时，当他说救恩属于主时，当他说这不是我的民族群体时，当他说这不是我和我的道德标准时，当他说救恩属于主时，他的种族主义得到了医治，他出发去尼尼微。但当他看到尼尼微被宽恕时，它又回来了。

我想让你意识到，当你成为基督徒时，你真的对你的罪做了一个好数目，你说没有其他东西在我和神之间，但在你成为基督徒之后，你会发现那些同样的罪经常会反弹。你觉得我砍倒了那棵树，但不久之后，树桩上冒出一个嫩芽。然后你挖出树桩。它消失了，接下来你知道，那里有根，那些根会在这里和那里长出一个小芽。

你会花一生的时间回去，不得不说，我以为我处理了那个偶像，它又回来了。它会不断地回来，但每次你都会处理另一个打击和另一个打击和另一个打击。那些把认可和爱的偶像当作偶像的人，你以为你一年前处理了它，但现在你必须回来，你必须拿福音，恩典的福音，你必须说，我真正需要的唯一的爱是我不能失去的那种爱。那些需要确定性的人，你必须把福音拧进你的心里，说我真正需要的唯一确定性是我不能失去的那种确定性。

那就是我被耶稣基督的自由恩典所接受的确定性。这就是你必须做的。这就是你必须不断做的。

## 通往高处的唯一道路 / The Only Way to the Heights

**The Path to the Heights:**

This is the only way to the heights, the heights. We talked about it in the call to worship. There was a man who was trying to get a bunch of soldiers.

I'll finish with this. A man who was trying to recruit soldiers years ago to a mountain campaign, and this is how he recruited them. He says, I do not want people to come with me under certain reservations.

In battle, you need soldiers who fear nothing. The roads are rugged. The precipices are steep.

There are feelings of dizziness on the heights. There are gusts of wind, peals of thunder, fierce eagles, and nights of awful gloom. But fear them not.

There are also the joys of sunlight, flowers such as are not on the plain, the purest of air, restful nooks, and the star smile like the eyes of God. You can, if you want, stay down on the plain, and when every so often, if you have some problem in your life, you can rush off to church or suddenly get out, you dust off your Bible and say, Lord, I'm in trouble. Help me.

Or you can decide to go to the mountain, and the only way to the heights, the only way up there where the stars smile like the eyes of God, is to say, I see that there are idols in my life. There are things that I add as a requirement to be happy. To Jesus Christ, Jesus is alone.

Jesus is my only Lord. Jesus is my exclusive Lord. I'm going to give myself to him absolutely, utterly, and totally, and put everything else second.

That's the only way to the heights. It's a hard process. It's a long process.

It's a painful process, but it's the only way out of the fog. It's the only way out of the smog. It's the only way out of the pollution.

It's the only way to the heights. Are you ready? Let's pray.

Our Father, this first commandment is the great one, and we pray, Lord, for two kinds of people here this morning. There are many of us that though we gave our lives to Jesus Christ, we have come to recognize that there's so little joy and excitement and vitality in our lives, and we realize now it's because we have tried to worship not just Jesus, but some other things that we've kept, that we've held on to, that we continue to bow down to in worship, and they are sapping us of the great spiritual power, vitality, and joy that we can have that we ought to have. Now Father, everyone in this room needs to detect the idols, the things that come before you.

Help us to do that now. Help us to give ourselves to you. And Father, there are other folk in this room who are for the first time recognizing and need to recognize what Jonah did in the belly of the fish, that salvation is not of their efforts and their striving, that they cannot just hold on to their goals and be saved by their own works and efforts with your help along the way, but that they must turn to you and receive you as Savior and Lord and say, salvation is of the Lord.

And Father, we pray that you'd enable them to really pray from their heart this prayer, Lord, though I've often lived according to my moral standards, I now see that I've never worshiped you truly, but I've worshiped other things. I now receive you as my Savior, my real hope, and I put other concerns and other goals as secondary. Our Father, enable us to worship you now from the heart, for that's our freedom.

We pray it in Jesus name, amen. Thanks for listening to today's teaching. It's our prayer that you were encouraged by it and that it helps you apply the gospel to your life and share it with others.

**通往高处的路：** 这是通往高处的唯一途径，高处。

我们在敬拜中谈到了这一点。有一个人试图召集一群士兵。我将以此结束。一个人试图招募士兵多年前参加一场山地战役，这是他招募他们的方式。

他说，我不想让人们在某些保留条件下和我一起去。在战斗中，你需要不怕任何东西的士兵。道路崎岖。悬崖陡峭。

在高处有眩晕的感觉。有狂风，雷声，凶猛的鹰，和可怕的黑夜。但不要害怕。还有阳光的快乐，平原上没有的花朵，最纯净的空气，宁静的角落，星星像神的眼睛一样微笑。

你可以，如果你愿意，留在平原上，每当你生活中有一些问题时，你可以冲到教堂或突然拿出你的圣经，擦去灰尘，说，主，我有麻烦了。帮助我。或者你可以决定去山上，唯一通往高处的途径，唯一在那里星星像神的眼睛一样微笑的地方，就是说，我看到我的生活中有偶像。有些东西我加上作为快乐的要求。

给耶稣基督，耶稣是独一无二的。耶稣是我唯一的主。耶稣是我唯一的主。我将完全、彻底地把自己交给他，把其他一切放在第二位。

这是通往高处的唯一途径。这是一个艰难的过程。这是一个漫长的过程。这是一个痛苦的过程，但这是摆脱迷雾的唯一途径。

这是摆脱烟雾的唯一途径。这是摆脱污染的唯一途径。这是通往高处的唯一途径。你准备好了吗？

让我们祷告。我们的父，这第一条诫命是伟大的，我们祈求主，为这里的两种人祷告。我们中有许多人，尽管我们把生命交给了耶稣基督，但我们现在意识到，我们的生活中几乎没有喜悦、兴奋和活力，我们意识到现在是因为我们试图不仅仅崇拜耶稣，还有一些我们保留的东西，我们继续向它们屈膝崇拜，它们正在消耗我们本可以拥有的伟大的属灵力量、活力和喜悦。现在父，房间里的每个人都需要检测偶像，那些在你面前的东西。

帮助我们现在做到这一点。帮助我们把自己交给你。父，还有其他人在这个房间里，他们第一次认识到并需要认识到约拿在鱼腹中所做的，救恩不是他们的努力和奋斗，他们不能仅仅依靠他们的目标并通过他们自己的工作和努力得救，而是他们必须转向你，接受你为救主和主，并说，救恩属于主。父，我们祈求你使他们能够真正从心底祈祷这个祷告，主，尽管我经常按照我的道德标准生活，但我现在看到我从未真正崇拜过你，而是崇拜过其他东西。

我现在接受你为我的救主，我**真正的希望，我把其他关心和其他目标放在次要位置。我们的父，使我们现在从心底崇拜你，因为那是**我们的自由。我们奉耶稣的名祈祷，阿门。感谢您收听今天的教导。
