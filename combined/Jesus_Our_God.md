# Jesus Our God / Jesus Our God

## Chinese Translation / 中文翻译 / English Transcript

Welcome to Gospel in Life. Christianity isn't just a spiritual practice or set of moral teachings. At its heart, it's the person of Jesus actively pursuing us.

In today's teaching, Tim Keller impacts how Jesus actively seeks us, reveals truth to us, and calls us to Himself. Gospel of Matthew, chapter 1, verses 20 to 23. But after Joseph had considered this, the people of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.

She will give birth to a son and you are to give him the name Jesus, because He will save his people from their sins. All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet. The Virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son and they will call him Emanuel, which means God with us.

This is God's Word. If there's one word that sums up Christmas, it comes up all the time in Scripture readings and in the carols at all the services, it's the word Emanuel, Emanuel. It means God with us.

And it's only got in English eight letters. And yet I tell you it is heavier than the heavens and the earth. I would like to open it up for a moment this morning and I would propose to you that in that one word, Emanuel, you have the most offensive and the most comforting, the most repulsive and the most attractive message that the world has ever heard.

It's the most repulsive and the most attractive. It's the most repulsive because it says Jesus Christ is God and it's the most attractive because it says Jesus Christ is God with us. Look.

First of all, it tells us that Jesus Christ is God. It's ironic that of all the Christian holidays, this is the one that's most broadly accepted and so popular. It's ironic because of all the Christian holidays, this particular holiday celebrates the one Christian doctrine which is the most offensive, the most in your face.

And seemingly, I said seemingly, the most exclusive. You see, Easter says our founder Jesus Christ was raised from the dead. What's offensive about that?

It's great. Great. He rose into the dead, he triumphed over death.

Even Lent in Good Friday says that our founder Jesus Christ died for our sins and even that. What's offensive about that? Sacrifice is great to die for your friends, it's noble.

But Christmas, at Christmas we say, our founder Jesus Christ is not just a human teacher, the way the Western scientific skeptics would say, and not just a manifestation of divine principle, a manifestation of divine consciousness, like the Eastern philosophers and mystics would say, Christmas tells us that Jesus Christ is the creator God Himself, the transcendent God Himself, who uniquely once and for all became a human being. This sets Christianity utterly apart from everyone else. This sets Christianity on a collision course with what every other philosophy or religion says about the nature of God.

Because over here in the West you have both Jews and Muslims that say God could never become human. But then over in the East you've got the Hindus and the Buddhists that are saying God continually becomes human. And Christianity won't have anything to do with either.

Because Christianity says that what happened at Christmas was that the transcendent creator God once and for all took upon Himself human nature. See Eastern religion believes that God is constantly manifesting, is constantly manifest in human beings. It's constantly being reborn.

But the doctrine of reincarnation is not at all the doctrine of incarnation, which is what Christmas is about, in which Christians believe and the Bible proclaims that Jesus Christ became once and for all human who was the transcendent creator God. Now that's very offensive to people. And that brings about what Christians, I guess you could call, only wayness.

You know, Jesus says, I am the way of the truth in the life. No one comes to the Father but by me, he says in John 14, that's, there it is, only wayness let's call it. And many people are so offended and so irritated by it.

And they say, I could accept classic Christianity. I love everything about classic Christianity except for that only wayness. But I can't stand.

It's too exclusive, they say. Now let's say a couple things about that quickly. First of all, the only wayness of Jesus Christ, the only wayness of Christianity is not an intolerant attitude.

Ah, people say that's the problem. If it was only, if only Christians could get rid of that intolerance, if they could only get rid of that exclusive attitude, then I could handle it a lot better. But don't you see?

The only wayness of Christianity is not an attitude, it's not a psychological thing. It's intrinsic to, it's part and parcel of what Christmas actually proclaims. Put it this way, it has nothing to do with attitude.

If you want to get rid of the only wayness of Christianity, you can't ask Christians just to sort of loosen up their attitude. You have to destroy Christmas, you have to take it away forever. Then there's a man who's very rich, and before he dies, he buries an incredible treasure, and he says it's somewhere in Wyoming, Montana, or Ohio, and then he dies.

And of course, a lot of people want to find it, but it's hopeless. Who in the world could ever find a treasure buried somewhere in such a vast track? Then all of a sudden, a small group of people come up and they publicly proclaim that they have found, from the hand of the man who had buried the treasure, the treasure map.

The map that tells right where it is. And they say, we have the map. Now, how would the discussion go?

On the one hand, there'd be some people who say, they have the map, and therefore they know the way to the treasure. And on the other hand, there'd be people who say, they don't have the map. And therefore, they don't have the way to the treasure.

But there would be nobody who would rationally say, what gives you the right to think you have the map? Because you see, it's not a matter of tolerance. It's a matter of whether that's the map or not.

Nobody would say, what gives you the right? How dare anyone think that they know the way to the treasure? That's silly.

And in the same way, when Jesus says, I'm the way, the truth, and the life, no one comes to the Father but through me. You can't say, why don't you just loosen up, Jesus? Why don't you just loosen up Christians?

Why don't you just have a more tolerant attitude? It's not an issue of tolerance. Is he the map?

We have the only religion. The only founder of any religion who claims to be God. Is he the map or not?

Either he is, and he's the way, because no other founder of any other religion claimed to be such a personage, or he's not the map and he's not a way, but how dare anybody say, how dare you even think that you had to have the right to have the map? Don't you see? And therefore, the only way to get rid of the only wayness of Christianity is to destroy Christmas because that's the premise on which it's based.

You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward, younger brother. In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who try to earn his love by being good. In his book, The prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental older brother, and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal, extravagant grace.

Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith, The prodigal God will help you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way. The prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the hope and joy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the world.

Now, here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching. But before you try to destroy Christmas, that is, and get all the retailers on Fifth Avenue very mad at you whether or not they believe.

I would suggest to you for a moment that you are wrong if you think the Christianity is an exclusive religion and that Christmas makes it an exclusive religion. All my friends, Christmas is telling us that Christianity is a radically inclusive religion and here's what I mean. When you hear someone say, ah yes, Christians believe they have to believe in Jesus to get to God.

Well, I believe that all good people, all worthy people, all decent and moral and loving people, no matter what they believe, can find God. Does that sound more inclusive to you? I tell you that is actually a form of very, very narrow exclusivity.

And here's why a person who says that may look more inclusive than a Christian, but actually their premise is that morality and goodness is enough to find God. That's their premise. Their premise is that that's enough to be loving, to be compassionate.

That's enough to find the divine, that's enough to find the good. Anyone they say who is really wonderful and loving and disciplined and diligent and able can find God, what about the rest of us? You exclusive types who say anybody, no matter what they believe, any good person can find God.

What about those of us who are not disciplined? What about those of us who are not unselfish? What about those of us who have lived lives in our record when we look at it, we're not proud of it at all?

What about those of us who are nervous wrecks? Don't you see, you're so called exclusivity and basically all religions and all philosophies outside of Christianity say the same thing. They say here's how you should live a good and decent and moral life and anyone who lives a good and decent moral life can find the divine.

That's radically exclusive because that means that your religion is only for the able, only for the discipline, only for the good. What about us failures? See Christianity is radically inclusive.

It's the one religion that says no matter who you are, no matter what you've done, no matter what your record is. You can unite with God. You can be welcomed into his family because all other religions say we've got, here's what to do.

Let's go to God. Christianity says God's come to us and he's come in the form of a person and all you have to do is believe in him, grab hold of him. When John the Baptist says to Jesus, how do we know you're the one to come?

And Jesus says, Matthew 11, he says this, he says look it, the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the poor have good news for each of them, the lepers, the poor, the outcast, the failures, the marginal people, the people that every other religion so-called inclusive religions to say all good and able when cultured people are able to find God. I have a religion says Jesus that's radically inclusive, that brings them all in because I'm not a prophet telling you how to get to God, I'm God who's come to you, I'm in man you well, I am God with you. It says in 1 Corinthians 1, the same kind of thing.

Paul says consider your calling my friends, he says to the Christian church there. Not many of you were wise, not many of you were influential, not many of you were of noble birth, but God chose the foolish things to shame the wise, God chose the weak things to shame the strong, God chose the despised things and even the things that are not to bring to nothing, the things that are that no one will boast in its presence. Don't you see Christianity is radically inclusive, it doesn't just include the strong, but the weak, not just the wise, but the foolish.

Everything else about Christianity makes no sense without Christmas. Jesus is God and that's why his death is so valuable, otherwise his death is of limited significance. Jesus says God and that's why his claims make sense.

Jesus says God and that's why it does make all other religions obsolete. Oh, you hate to hear that because it's so much more radically inclusive than they are. Jesus says no matter who you are, no matter what you've done, take hold of me, rest of me, all you need is need, all you need is nothing.

See, repulsive and attractive at once, he is not only God but God with us. Listen friends, as I conclude, let me just point this out to you. This is a medicine chest, Christmas is a medicine chest in which you've got the medicine to heal whatever ails you.

And I wish you saw that and I every year I try to break through the sentimental feelings and the nostalgic feelings that you get whenever you come to a Christmas service. I want you to see what's really there. Let me give you just a couple real quick examples.

Some of you have guilty consciences today. Like Lady Macbeth, you're walking around and you can't get out that damn spot. And somebody's told you, well, this is low self esteem, but if you're more candid, it's guilt.

You failed, you've come up short and you are trying to pay for it and you'll never understand your life until you begin to understand it in terms of moral economics. You're trying to pay for your failures with your tears or you're trying to pay with your good deeds or you're trying to pay with your accomplishments or with your achievements or you're trying to pay through self destructive behavior or you're trying to pay through rescuing people with them, you're trying to pay. Look at Jesus through Emmanuel.

Who was it that died on the cross for you? God. Not just anybody, not just a nice guy, God.

It says in Acts 20 verse 28, God redeemed us with his own blood, the blood of God. What is that worth? Anything.

So stop trying to pay. Stop trying to get that damn spot out, as the lady Macbeth would say, with your tears and with your efforts, come to him, he's a man you will. He died for you.

God died for you. One drop of his blood will pay for anything. You can put it behind you.

You've got to stop there. Don't you see, Emmanuel is a medicine that will handle anything. But most of all, let me say now what I said at the beginning of the service, Emmanuel is all about God coming to be with us.

And if God, the great God of the universe, would become a wriggling little baby for us, what should you be willing to do to get near him? It cost him tremendously to get near us. It's going to cost you something to get near him, but nothing like what it cost him.

You're going to have to give up your sins. You're going to have to give up your life. You may have to give up a lot more of your time.

But if you have a God who's willing to come this far to get near you, don't you think that when you make the effort to get near him, he'll respond, claw, clutch, crawl, do anything to get near this God. Or there's anything in your life keeping you away from him now, get rid of it. He's God with us, Emmanuel.

Come to him, let's pray. Father, we ask now that you would grant to us to see the repulsive attractiveness of this great truth. We pray that you would help us to use it on our lives and use it on our hearts so that we would see the radical grace that's therein.

And we would also see that this is something that will cure us of anything, no matter what we've done, no matter where we are, no matter how far away we are, we can come near because your son came to us. We pray that you'd help us by your Holy Spirit to apply these great truths to our hearts and our lives now. We ask it in Jesus' name, amen.

欢迎收听《生命中的福音》。基督教不仅仅是灵性修炼或道德教诲。在它的核心，它是耶稣基督积极地追求我们。今天我们要学习的是提摩太·基勒如何阐述耶稣积极地寻求我们、向我们揭示真理并呼召我们归向祂的内容。

马太福音第一章20至23节。但约瑟心里正想这事的时候，有主的使者在梦中向他显现，说：“约瑟，大卫的儿子，不要惧怕，只管娶过你的妻子马利亚来；因她所怀的孕是从圣灵来的。她将要生一个儿子，你要给他起名叫耶稣，因为祂要将自己的百姓从罪恶里救出来。”这一切的事都是主借着先知所说的话要应验的：“必有童女怀孕生子，人要称祂的名字为以马内利。

”（意即：神与我们同在。） 这是上帝的话语。如果有一个词能概括圣诞节，它在圣经读经和所有礼拜的圣诞颂歌中经常出现，这个词就是“以马内利”，以马内利。这个词只有八个字母。

然而我要告诉你，它比天还重，比地还重。今天早上我想稍微展开一下这个词语，并且向你们提出一个观点：在这个词“以马内利”里，你找到了世界上最令人反感和最令人安慰、最让人排斥和最吸引人的信息。它是最令人反感的，因为它说耶稣基督是神；它又是最吸引人的，因为它说耶稣基督与我们同在。让我们来看一下： 首先，它告诉我们耶稣基督是神。

有趣的是，在所有基督教节日中，这个节日是最广泛接受和最受欢迎的一个。这很讽刺，因为在这所有的基督教节日中，这个特别的节日庆祝的是最令人反感、最直接的基督教教义。你看，复活节说我们的创始者耶稣基督从死里复活了。有什么能比这更令人反感吗？

恰恰相反，这是伟大的。祂战胜了死亡，取得了胜利。即使在复活节的 Lent 期间，耶稣基督为我们死在十字架上赎罪的说法也依然存在。这有什么可冒犯的呢？

牺牲是为朋友而死的伟大行为，是高尚的行为。但是圣诞节的时候，我们说我们的创始人耶稣基督不仅仅是一个人类教师，就像西方的科学怀疑论者所说的那样；也不仅仅是一种神圣原则或神圣意识的表现，就像东方的哲学家和神秘主义者所说的那样。圣诞节告诉我们的是，耶稣基督是创造宇宙的神本身，超越一切的神本身，祂唯一且永远地成为了一位人类。这使基督教与所有其他哲学或宗教关于神的本质的说法截然不同。

这也让基督教与所有其他哲学或宗教处于对立之中。因为在西方，犹太教和伊斯兰教都说神不可能成为人；而在东方，印度教和佛教则认为神不断成为人。但基督教对此一概不认同。因为基督教说，在圣诞节的时候发生的是，超越一切的创造宇宙之神一次性且永远地取了人性。

东方宗教相信神不断地显现为人，不断地重生。但是，转世的说法与圣诞节所强调的道成肉身完全不同，这就是基督徒所信仰并由圣经宣告的内容：耶稣基督成为了一位人类，祂是超越一切的创造宇宙之神。这非常冒犯人。这也让基督教被称为“唯一之道”。

你知道，耶稣说：“我是道路、真理和生命；没有人能到父那里去，除非是经过我。”这就是所谓的“唯一之道”。许多人对此感到如此愤怒和不满。他们说：我可以接受传统基督教的一切，除了这个“唯一之道”。

但我也无法忍受。它太排外了，他们说。现在让我们快速地说一下这个观点。首先，耶稣基督的唯一性，基督教的唯一性，并不是一种不容忍的态度。

人们常说这就是问题所在。如果只有基督徒能去除这种不容忍的态度，如果他们能摆脱那种排外的心态，那我就能更好地接受它。但你有没有发现？基督教的唯一性并不是态度的问题，也不是心理上的事情。

它是圣诞所宣扬内容的一部分。换个说法，这与态度无关。如果你想消除基督教的唯一性，不能只是要求基督徒放松他们的态度。你需要摧毁圣诞节，永远地把它拿走。

然后有一个非常富有的人，在他死前埋下了一件不可思议的财宝，并说它在怀俄明州、蒙大拿州或俄亥俄州某处，然后他就死了。当然，很多人想找到它，但这是不可能的。谁能找到被埋藏在如此广阔土地上的宝藏呢？突然之间，一小群人出现了，他们公开宣称自己从那位埋藏财宝的人手中得到了财宝地图，并说这就是财宝的位置。

现在讨论会怎样进行？一方面，有人会说，他们有地图，所以他们知道通往财宝的路。另一方面，有人会说，他们没有地图，所以他们不知道通往财宝的路。但没有人会理性地说，凭什么你们认为自己有地图？

因为你看，这不关乎容忍与否。而是关于那是否是正确的地图。没有人会说，凭什么你们认为自己知道通往财宝的路？这是荒谬的。

同样地，当耶稣说，我是道路、真理、生命，除了我，没有人能到父那里去时，你不能说，为什么你不放松一下，耶稣？为什么不让基督徒放松一点？> 无人能到父那里去，除非是经过我。为什么你不换个宽容的态度呢？

这不是一个宽容的问题。他是地图吗？我们有唯一的宗教。唯一声称自己是神的任何宗教的创始人。

他是地图，还是不是？如果他是，那他就是唯一的道路，因为没有任何其他宗教的创始人声称自己是这样的人物；如果不是，他就不是地图，也不是一条路，但你怎么敢说，你怎么敢认为你有权拥有这张地图呢？你不明白吗？因此，要摆脱基督教的唯一性，就必须摧毁圣诞节，因为这是它建立的基础。

你知道浪子回头的故事，但这不仅仅是关于一个离家出走的弟弟。事实上，耶稣讲这个故事是为了对那些远离神的人和那些试图通过做好事来赢得他的爱的人说话。在他的书中，《浪子的神》一书作者提摩西·凯勒展示了这个广为人知的故事揭示了福音的核心信息——这既是叛逆弟弟的希望之言，也是苛刻哥哥的宽恕之言，并邀请所有人体验神那慷慨而执着的恩典。无论你是基督徒还是仍在探索信仰，读《浪子的神》都能帮助你以全新的方式看待与基督的关系。

《浪子的神》是本月我们感谢您的礼物，旨在通过福音和生命向全世界的人们分享基督宽厚而不懈之爱的希望与喜悦。请访问 gospelandlife.com/give 获取您的副本。现在，请听提摩西·凯勒博士继续今天的教导。但在你试图摧毁圣诞节之前——无论他们是否相信——先提醒你一件事：如果你认为基督教是一个排他的宗教，圣诞节并不会让这个宗教变得排他，那么你错了。

亲爱的朋友，圣诞节告诉我们，基督教是一种极富包容性的宗教。**这意味着什么？当你听到有人说：“是的，基督徒们相信必须相信耶稣才能见到神。**” 好吧，我相信所有善良的人、值得尊敬的人、正直有道德和充满爱的人，无论他们信仰什么，都能找到上帝。

这听起来更包容了吗？其实这是一种非常狭隘的排他性。而且这里有一个原因：说这种话的人看似比基督徒更加包容，但实际上他们的前提是认为道德与善良足以找到上帝。这就是他们的前提——认为这是足够的爱、足够的同情心。

这是找到神圣、找到美好的足够条件。他们认为任何真正优秀、充满爱、自律和勤奋的人都能找到上帝，那我们呢？你们这些自认为是排他性的人说，无论别人相信什么，所有善良的人都能找到上帝。那那些不自律的我们怎么办？

那些自私的我们怎么办？那些回顾自己的人生记录时，根本无法为自己感到骄傲的我们怎么办？那些神经兮兮的我们又该怎么办？你没看到吗？

你们所谓的排他性实际上与所有宗教和哲学（除了基督教）的说法是一样的。他们说：这是如何过上一个善良、正直、有道德的生活的方法，任何这样生活的人都能找到神圣。这实际上是极端排他的，因为它意味着你的宗教只适用于那些有能力、自律、善良的人。那我们这些失败者呢？

看看基督教，它是极富包容性的。它是唯一一种信仰说：无论你是谁，无论你做过什么，无论你的记录如何，你都可以与上帝联合，被接纳为他家庭的一员。因为其他所有宗教都说：这是你需要做的，让我们去见上帝。而基督教却说：上帝已经来到我们中间，并以人的形式出现，你只需要相信他、抓住他。

当约翰·施洗者问耶稣：“我们该怎么做才能知道你是我们要找的那一位？” 耶稣说，马太福音11章中这样说：“瞎子看见，瘸子行走，麻风病人得洁净，聋子听见，死人复活，穷人有好信息传给他们。这信息是给瞎子的，给瘸子的，给麻风病人的，给穷人的，给外邦人，给软弱的人，给罪人的——那些其他宗教自诩包容一切、认为自己文化高雅的人，以为能找到上帝。耶稣说，我有一个宗教，它极其包容，因为它把所有人都包括进来，因为我不是告诉你们如何找到上帝的先知，我是来找到你们的上帝，我与人同在，我是与你们同在的上帝。

保罗在哥林多前书1章中也这样说：“我的朋友们，请你们考虑一下自己的身份。在基督里的信徒中，并没有多少是智慧的人，也没有多少是有权势的人，更没有多少是贵族出身的人。然而，上帝却拣选了那些看似愚拙的事物来羞辱那些自以为聪明的人；他拣选了软弱的事物来羞辱那些强壮的人；他拣选了卑贱和无价值的事物来使有价值的事物显得一文不值。你们难道没有看到，基督教是极其包容的吗？

它不仅包括强者，也包括弱者；不仅包括智者，也包括愚者。如果没有圣诞节，一切关于基督教的事情都不成立。耶稣是上帝，这就是为什么他的死如此宝贵，否则他的死就没有什么意义了。耶稣说他是上帝，这就是为什么他的声明是有道理的。

耶稣说他是上帝，这就是为什么其他所有宗教都变得不再重要。哦，你们不喜欢听到这一点，因为它比其他任何宗教都要包容得多。耶稣说，无论你是谁，无论你做过什么，只要抓住我，依靠我，你需要的一切，你都需要的，就是我。看看吧，既令人厌恶又吸引人，他不仅是上帝，而且是与我们同在的上帝。

朋友们，请听我说，在我结束时，让我再强调一点。圣诞节就像一个药箱，里面装有治愈一切疾病的药物。```markdown 我希望大家能看清这一点，每年我都在努力突破你们在圣诞节礼拜时所感受到的怀旧情绪和感伤。我想让你们看到真正的东西。

让我给你们举几个真实的例子。有些人今天心里有负罪感，就像麦克白夫人一样，你走来走去，那个污点怎么也擦不掉。有人告诉你这是自卑感，但如果你更坦诚的话，那其实是内疚。你失败了，没有达到预期，试图用眼泪、善行、成就或自我毁灭行为来弥补，甚至通过救助他人来赎罪。

你看耶稣通过“神与我们同在”。是谁在十字架上为你而死？是上帝。不是随便什么人，也不是一个好人，而是上帝。

使徒行传20章28节说：“你们要谨慎自己和上帝的恩赐。”上帝用他的宝血赎回了我们，“上帝的血”是什么价值？任何价值。所以，不要再试图弥补。

不要再像麦克白夫人那样，试图通过眼泪和努力来擦掉那个污点，而是来到他面前，他会接纳你。因为他为你而死。上帝为你而死。一滴他的血就能赎买一切。

你可以放下这一切。你们必须在这里停下来。难道你看不出来，“神与我们同在”是一种可以解决任何问题的药方吗？但最重要的是，我要再次强调我在礼拜开始时所说的——“神与我们同在”全部关于上帝来到我们中间。

如果宇宙中伟大的上帝愿意成为一个小婴儿来接近我们，你愿意为此付出什么代价呢？他为了接近我们付出了巨大的代价。你接近他的代价可能会很大，但绝不会像他所付出的那么大。你们必须舍弃罪恶，舍弃生命。

也许还需要放弃更多的时间。``` 这样翻译既保留了原文的格式和内容，又尽可能地保持了原汁原味的修辞风格。但是如果你有一个愿意为你这么远而来的神，你认为当你努力靠近他时，他会不理不睬吗？他会不会用尽一切办法来接近这个神呢——爪、抓、爬，做任何事情。

或者，如果你生活中有东西阻止你靠近他，就把它去掉吧。他是与我们同在的神，以马内利。让我们来到他面前祷告。天父，我们现在祈求你能帮助我们看到这伟大真理的吸引力和厌恶感。

求你帮助我们在生命中应用它，在心中应用它，使我们能看见其中的彻底恩典。我们也看到，这个真理能够治愈一切——无论我们做了什么，无论我们在哪里，无论我们有多远，因为我们有你的儿子来到我们中间。求你在圣灵里帮助我们把这些伟大的真理应用到我们的心和生命中。我们在耶稣的名里祈求，阿们。
