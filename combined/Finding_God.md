## 引言与经文诵读 / Introduction and Scripture Reading

Welcome to Gospel in Life. How comfortable are you when it comes to being open about your faith? This month on the podcast, Tim Keller looks at what the Bible says about having a public faith.

He shows us what it looks like to be open about our faith in a pluralistic society in a way that creates civility and peace and meaningful dialogue with our neighbors. Tonight's scripture reading comes from Exodus, chapter 3, verses 1 through 14. Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horib, the mountain of God.

There an angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that the bush was on fire and it did not burn up. So Moses thought, I will go over and see the strange sight why the bush does not burn up.

When the Lord saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush. Moses, Moses, and Moses said, here I am. Do not come any closer, God said.

Take off your sandals for the place where you are standing as holy ground. Then he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. At this Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at God.

The Lord said, I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers and I am concerned about their suffering. So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land.

A land flowing with milk and honey, the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Parasites, Hivites, and Jebysites. And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them. So now go.

I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt. But Moses said to God, who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt? And God said, I will be with you.

And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you. When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain. Moses said to God, suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, the God of your fathers has sent me to you and they ask me, what is his name?

Then what shall I tell them? God said to Moses, I am who I am. This is what you are to say to the Israelites.

I am has sent me to you. The word of the Lord, thanks be to God.

欢迎来到"生命中的福音"。当谈到公开表达你的信仰时,你感觉有多自在?本月在播客中,提摩太·凯勒将探讨圣经如何论述拥有公开信仰这个话题。

他向我们展示,在一个多元化的社会中,以一种能够创造文明、和平以及与邻舍进行有意义对话的方式公开我们的信仰是什么样子。今晚的经文诵读来自出埃及记第3章,第1到14节。摩西牧养他岳父米甸祭司叶忒罗的羊群,他领羊群往旷野的背面,来到神的山,就是何烈山。

耶和华的使者从荆棘里火焰中向摩西显现。摩西看见荆棘被火烧着,却没有烧毁。摩西说,我要过去看这大异象,这荆棘为何没有烧坏呢?

耶和华见他过去要看,神就从荆棘里呼叫说,摩西,摩西。他说,我在这里。神说,不要近前来。

当把你脚上的鞋脱下来,因为你所站之地是圣地。又说,我是你父亲的神,是亚伯拉罕的神,以撒的神,雅各的神。摩西蒙上脸,因为怕看神。

耶和华说,我的百姓在埃及所受的困苦,我实在看见了。他们因受督工的辖制所发的哀声,我也听见了。我原知道他们的痛苦。我下来是要救他们脱离埃及人的手,领他们出了那地,到美好宽阔流奶与蜜之地。

就是到迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人之地。现在以色列人的哀声达到我耳中,我也看见埃及人怎样欺压他们。故此我要打发你去见法老。

使你可以将我的百姓以色列人从埃及领出来。摩西对神说,我是什么人,竟能去见法老,将以色列人从埃及领出来呢?神说,我必与你同在。

你将百姓从埃及领出来之后,你们必在这山上事奉神,这就是我打发你去的证据。摩西对神说,我到以色列人那里,对他们说,你们祖宗的神打发我到你们这里来。他们若问我说,他的名叫什么?

我要对他们说什么呢?神对摩西说,我是自有永有的。你要对以色列人这样说,那自有的打发我到你们这里来。

这是耶和华的话,感谢神。

## 带领我们遇见神的四件事 / Four Things That Bring Us to Meet God

Now, each week we are looking at the subject of how we can talk about our deepest faith beliefs in public, how can we share who we are, our deep faith beliefs, but in such a way that is respectful, promotes peace, and I have observed over the years that one of the best ways of having a discussion about faith publicly is to not simply talk about what you believe, but also how you came to believe it.

Not just do the content, but the process or the journey that you went on, you know, it's not just, here's what I believe, but how did you come to believe what you believe? How did you come to have faith in the God you have faith in? It's a journey account, or some people would call it a personal testimony, and I think it lowers the temperature, because when you're not just saying, here's what I believe, no, here's what I believe, you're talking about the process and the experience by which you came to your faith, I think it commands a certain respect, you know, you listen to what person's account of their experience, I think it also very often is helpful because everybody's on a process, and to hear how you went through your process is helpful.

And so in order to help us think about how we can think about this, is we're looking at this passage, which is very famous, Moses in the Burning Bush, there's an awful, Leo and I were up here just talking about maybe some of you were on the generation, but it's hard for me not to think of Charlton Heston, and Cecil B. DeMille's voice or whoever's voice coming from the Burning Bush, I mean, it's a very famous, that was the movie Ten Commandments, some of you movies you used to go and watch them on big screens and things like that, I know it's sorry, it's kind of ancient history, but it's actually, this account is here, and we're looking at it tonight because it's Moses' conversion experience. This is Moses' conversion experience.

This is how he didn't just come to believe in God, he already believed in God. In fact, when God speaks to him, he says, look, I'm the God of your father, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, when he says that, he's saying, I'm the God you believe in, actually, I'm the God of your father, the God of your father, he knows that Moses believes in this God, he's never encountered him, he's never had a face-to-face experience with him, he hasn't met him, and therefore it can be said that this is Moses' conversion experience, and so if we see how he didn't come just to believe in God, but actually meet God, we're going to see four things that brought him to that, and I think there's the same four things that the Bible says you have to have usually happen in your life if you're going to meet him as well. So, if Moses met him this way, we need these four things, usually, in order to actually experience and meet God, what are those four things?

They are a disrupting sight, an expanding concept, a personal problem, and a surprising grace.

现在,每一周我们都在探讨这个主题,就是我们如何能够在公开场合谈论我们最深的信仰,我们如何能够分享我们是谁,我们深刻的信仰,但要以一种尊重的方式,促进和平。我多年来观察到,在公开场合讨论信仰的最好方式之一,不仅仅是谈论你相信什么,还要谈论你是如何来相信的。

不只是讲内容,还要讲过程或你所经历的旅程,你知道,不只是"这就是我所相信的",而是你是如何来相信你所相信的?你是如何对你所信的神产生信心的?这是一个旅程的叙述,或者有些人会称之为个人见证。我认为这能降低温度,因为当你不只是在说"这就是我所相信的",不,而是"这就是我所相信的",你在谈论你通过什么过程和经历来到你的信仰时,我认为这赢得了某种尊重,你知道,你倾听一个人对他们经历的叙述。我也认为这通常很有帮助,因为每个人都在一个过程中,听你如何经历你的过程是有帮助的。

所以为了帮助我们思考如何思考这个问题,我们要看这段经文,这是非常著名的,摩西与燃烧的荆棘。这太可怕了,利奥和我刚才在这里谈论,也许你们中的一些人属于那一代,但我很难不想到查尔顿·赫斯顿,以及塞西尔·B·德米尔的声音,或者不管是谁的声音从燃烧的荆棘中发出,我的意思是,这是非常著名的,那是电影《十诫》,你们中的一些人,电影你们过去会去大银幕上观看这类东西,我知道这有点抱歉,这有点像古代历史,但实际上,这个叙述就在这里,我们今晚要看它,因为这是摩西的归信经历。这是摩西的归信经历。

这是他如何不仅仅来相信神,他已经相信神了。事实上,当神对他说话时,他说,看,我是你父亲的神,亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各的神,当他这样说时,他是在说,我就是你所相信的神,实际上,我是你父亲的神,你父亲的神,他知道摩西相信这位神,他从未遇见过他,他从未与他有过面对面的经历,他没有遇见过他,因此可以说这是摩西的归信经历。所以如果我们看到他如何不仅仅来相信神,而是实际遇见神,我们将看到四件事把他带到那里,我认为同样的四件事,圣经说,如果你也要遇见他,通常必须在你生命中发生。所以,如果摩西以这种方式遇见他,我们也需要这四件事,通常,为了真正经历和遇见神,这四件事是什么?

它们是:一个打扰的景象,一个扩展的概念,一个个人的问题,和一个令人惊讶的恩典。

## 打扰的景象:燃烧的荆棘 / A Disrupting Sight: The Burning Bush

Okay, so first, a disrupting sight. The first thing that brings Moses to actually meet God is the bush itself, verse two and three.

Moses saw that though the bush was on fire, it did not burn up, so Moses thought, I will go over and see this strange sight, why the bush is not consumed, does not burn up. Now, Moses probably originally saw a brush fire over here, some distance, but that wasn't all that unusual, there's a lot of reasons why you can have brush fires in the desert, but what caught his attention was this fire didn't go out, and as you can imagine, brush fires are fast, why? Because there's no fuel out there, a bush, or some brush isn't much in the way of fuel, so fires that do happen out there because of lightning or for other whatever reason, or maybe some other shepherd who went by and left a campfire going.

If you are going to have a brush fire, it goes out quickly, but evidently this bush kept burning and burning and burning and burning, and we're told that Moses decided, I better go see what this is, why? Because that doesn't make sense, it doesn't fit, that's impossible, a bush has to burn out, I mean the fire consumes the bush and then it goes out, why is the bush continued to burn, why is the fire continued to burn, and we're told he went over, see twice it uses this word, I will go over and see this strange sight, verse 4, it says, the Lord saw that he had gone over, that is a Hebrew word that means the detour, he let himself be interrupted, his normal path was interrupted, okay, what's the first principle, here's the first principle, ordinarily you don't meet God unless something comes into your life that you can't account for and disrupts your life or disrupts your thinking, very often seriously disrupts and interrupts you, what Moses saw the burning bush didn't fit his understanding of what could happen, because it didn't fit, he went over to see it and figure it out and consider it and so forth, and we usually do not come to faith in God, just simply by thinking about it, we usually have to have something that comes into our life that disrupts us, that we can't account for, and that makes us think in ways we didn't before.

好的,首先,一个打扰的景象。第一件把摩西真正带到遇见神的事情就是荆棘本身,第2和第3节。

摩西看见荆棘被火烧着,却没有烧毁,摩西说,我要过去看这大异象,这荆棘为何没有烧坏呢?现在,摩西可能最初在某个距离看到一场灌木火灾,但这并不是那么不寻常,在沙漠中有很多原因可以引发灌木火灾,但引起他注意的是这火没有熄灭,你可以想象,灌木火灾很快,为什么?因为那里没有什么燃料,一个灌木,或一些灌木不算什么燃料,所以那里发生的火灾,因为闪电或其他什么原因,或者也许其他一些牧羊人经过留下了一堆还在燃烧的篝火。

如果你要有一场灌木火灾,它会很快熄灭,但显然这个荆棘一直在燃烧,一直燃烧,一直燃烧,一直燃烧,我们被告知摩西决定,我最好去看看这是什么,为什么?因为那说不通,那不合理,那是不可能的,一个荆棘必须烧尽,我的意思是火消耗了荆棘然后就熄灭了,为什么这个荆棘继续燃烧,为什么这火继续燃烧,我们被告知他走过去,看,两次使用这个词,我要过去看这大异象,第4节说,耶和华见他过去要看,那是一个希伯来词,意思是绕道,他让自己被打断了,他正常的路径被打断了,好的,第一个原则是什么,这是第一个原则,通常你不会遇见神,除非有什么东西进入你的生命,是你无法解释的,并且打扰了你的生活或打扰了你的思想,非常经常是严重地打扰和打断你,摩西所看到的燃烧的荆棘不符合他对可能发生的事情的理解,因为它不符合,他就过去看它,弄清楚它,思考它等等,而我们通常不会仅仅通过思考就来到对神的信心,我们通常必须有某些东西进入我们的生命,打扰我们,我们无法解释,这使我们以以前没有的方式思考。

## 范式转变与我们如何改变想法 / Paradigm Shifts and How We Change Our Minds

Thomas Kuhn wrote a book in the mid 20th century called The Structure of Scientific Revolutions which explains this, it's an academic book that you probably have not heard of and yet you have probably because it was very famous, at least maybe not by name, Kuhn was writing about how science works, the Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn tried, he was a philosopher of science, historian of science, and he said, actually science does not move forward the way you tend to say, scientists like to say, I'm objective and when I get a new bit of data, I look at it, and if I follow the evidence wherever it leads and so I'm gradually making small changes, I'm getting more evidence, I'm getting clear of you and I'm changing my views in the court with the evidence, and Kuhn says now, that's not how it works.

Kuhn says, we are very close minded, all of us, we are not open to new evidence and he says all of us tend to have interpretive grids by which we interpret reality. Now a grid is what he called a paradigm, so yes, actually he, I think, popularized the term paradigm, a paradigm is a way of looking at reality. And Kuhn says, we really have those views, these interpretive grids, these ways of looking at reality, and when new evidence comes along we do everything we can to use that evidence to confirm what we already believe.

We do everything we can to work it in, now I'll tell you, one of the perfect, to me examples of that was 9-11. Here we all are all looking at the same horrible thing that happened, we're looking right at it, there it is. But there were some people who had an interpretive grid that said, America is the bad guys in the world.

We're a force for materialism and abuse of power, whatever, we're the bad guys in the world. And there was another people who said, America is the good guy, we're the force of good on the side of good against evil. So once as America is a good guy, once as America is a bad guy, it's amazing, I read the essays of people after 9-11, we were looking at the very same thing and everybody used it to say, see, this is what I always said, this is what I always believed.

See 9-11, that proves that we're the bad guy, the world hates us. See 9-11, other people said, that proves that we're the good people and we have evil on against us. We had two different groups of people with two different paradigms, they were totally opposite to each other, they were looking at the same bit of data and using it to support the paradigm.

Thomas Koon says, we're not open-minded people, we have our set of beliefs and when a piece of data comes, we use it to confirm what we already believe, except Koon says, sometimes stuff comes into our lives that this rubs. Sometimes stuff comes into our lives that we can't really account for in the grid, it doesn't really fit, it's difficult to work it in. Koon's example, of course, the classic example was our Western understanding of the solar system.

Koon said, for years, people believed that the earth was fixed and the earth was in the center and there were all these other bodies orbiting around it and of course that seemed to explain. You looked up in the sky and you could see other bodies moving and we said, of course, they're all orbiting around us and so every time you got a new bit of data, we found a new planet, we found another, you know, the astronomers found another heavenly body, they said of course that fits into the grid and then Koon says, what began to happen was some of the bodies that we saw in space didn't seem to fit. Their movements didn't seem to work into this idea that everything was orbiting around earth.

Some of them kind of moved infinitely like zigzags in the sky and that didn't seem to really work. Koon says, what happens eventually is enough data comes in, you can't account for or something comes in, you can't account for and it leads you to question the grid itself and you sit there and say, oh, maybe I got it wrong and you try on, it's like trying on a dress, you try on a new paradigm, you try something else on and you say, well, maybe the earth is orbiting too. And when you try that paradigm on, suddenly it makes sense of all the data and you have what he calls a paradigm shift, it's like a conversion, suddenly you realize if I change the grid then suddenly I can explain everything else and you have this enormous shift so he says basically because we're so close-minded, we do not move, we don't change our bodies little by little, instead we try to work everything into confirm our existing paradigms until something comes in a burning bush, something that doesn't fit, something you can't account for, you try on a new way of thinking and it creates a shift, basically a kind of conversion.

托马斯·库恩在20世纪中叶写了一本书叫《科学革命的结构》来解释这一点,这是一本学术书籍,你可能没有听说过,但你可能听说过,因为它非常有名,至少可能不是通过名字。库恩在写关于科学如何运作的,《科学革命的结构》,库恩试图,他是一个科学哲学家,科学史学家,他说,实际上科学不是按照你倾向于说的方式前进的,科学家喜欢说,我是客观的,当我得到一个新的数据时,我看着它,如果我跟随证据无论它引向哪里,所以我逐渐做出小的改变,我得到更多证据,我对你越来越清楚,我根据证据改变我的观点,库恩说不,那不是它的运作方式。

库恩说,我们非常封闭,我们所有人,我们不对新证据开放,他说我们所有人倾向于有解释性的网格,通过这些网格我们解释现实。现在一个网格就是他所说的范式,所以是的,实际上他,我认为,普及了范式这个术语,范式是一种看待现实的方式。库恩说,我们真的有这些观点,这些解释性的网格,这些看待现实的方式,当新证据出现时,我们尽一切可能使用那个证据来确认我们已经相信的。

我们尽一切可能把它融入进来,现在我告诉你,对我来说完美的例子之一就是9-11。我们所有人都在看同样可怕的事情发生,我们正看着它,就在那里。但有一些人有一个解释性的网格说,美国是世界上的坏人。

我们是物质主义和滥用权力的力量,无论什么,我们是世界上的坏人。而另一些人说,美国是好人,我们是善的力量,站在善的一边反对邪恶。所以一次美国是好人,一次美国是坏人,这很惊人,我读了人们在9-11之后的文章,我们在看完全相同的事情,每个人都用它来说,看,这就是我一直说的,这就是我一直相信的。

看9-11,这证明我们是坏人,世界恨我们。看9-11,其他人说,这证明我们是好人,我们有邪恶对抗我们。我们有两组不同的人,有两个不同的范式,它们彼此完全相反,他们在看同样的数据,用它来支持范式。

托马斯·库恩说,我们不是思想开放的人,我们有我们固定的信念,当一个数据出现时,我们用它来确认我们已经相信的,除了库恩说,有时候东西进入我们的生命,这会摩擦。有时候东西进入我们的生命,我们真的无法在网格中解释,它真的不符合,很难把它融入进来。库恩的例子,当然,经典的例子是我们西方对太阳系的理解。

库恩说,多年来,人们相信地球是固定的,地球在中心,所有这些其他天体围绕它运转,当然这似乎可以解释。你抬头看天空,你可以看到其他天体在移动,我们说,当然,它们都围绕我们运转,所以每次你得到一个新的数据,我们发现了一个新行星,我们发现了另一个,你知道,天文学家发现了另一个天体,他们说当然这符合网格。然后库恩说,开始发生的是我们在太空中看到的一些天体似乎不符合。它们的运动似乎不能融入这个所有东西都围绕地球运转的想法。

它们中的一些在天空中像之字形移动,这似乎真的不起作用。库恩说,最终发生的是足够多的数据进来,你无法解释,或者某些东西进来,你无法解释,它导致你质疑网格本身,你坐在那里说,哦,也许我搞错了,你试穿,就像试穿一件衣服,你试穿一个新范式,你试穿别的东西,你说,嗯,也许地球也在运转。当你试穿那个范式时,突然它对所有数据都说得通,你有了他所说的范式转变,这就像一次归信,突然你意识到如果我改变网格,那么突然我可以解释所有其他东西,你有了这个巨大的转变。所以他说基本上因为我们如此封闭,我们不移动,我们不一点一点地改变我们的身体,相反我们试图把所有东西都融入来确认我们现有的范式,直到某些东西进来,一个燃烧的荆棘,某些不符合的东西,某些你无法解释的东西,你试穿一种新的思考方式,它创造了一个转变,基本上是一种归信。

## 现实生活中的燃烧荆棘 / Real-Life Burning Bushes

Now, that's how it is with God, usually, usually something comes into your life, it's a burning bush and you can't account for it. You've got to set a belief, either you don't believe in God or you believe whether probably is a God but nobody knows, you either have an inconsequential God or you have no God or something like that, a God that you don't need to know in order to live life and then something comes into your life and you can't account for it. It could be a train of thought, we've talked about this in the last couple of weeks, you know, WHO, who lived here in the Upper East Side in World War II, Great British Poet, didn't believe in God, but World War II came, we talked about this at length in the last couple of weeks.

World War II comes along, WHO sees the Nazis what they're doing and he says, wait a minute, there's no God, what right do I have to say that my values are right and there's a wrong? If there's no God, what warrant do I have for saying I'm right and they're wrong? And so he's thought like this, if there's no God, all morality is relative but no, morality is not relative, what they're doing is wrong and therefore there must be a God.

The train of thought came along that didn't fit in to his grid and he had a paradigm shift. He had a change in it, he questioned the grid itself so it can be kind of an intellectual burning bush, a train of thought, but very often it's something else. Years ago when Redeemer got started and we had a few hundred people, you know, actually in the early days, I mean the first couple of years, this body was about the size of Redeemer, the whole of Redeemer.

And we were, this is the late 80s, early 90s and we were just normal New Yorkers, we were people who worked in Wall Street, worked in the arts, you know, worked in fashion, just normal New Yorkers, but I used to find that if you brought a person in, the average man had 99.9% of the average man had nights didn't believe in historic Christianity or anything like that. But if they came in and they just sat down and they realized we all believed in historic Christianity, they were here for about 10 or 15 minutes, they started having paradigm shifts. Redeemer itself was a burning bush, you know why?

Because in their grid, people like them, people who'd gone to the same schools, people who did the same jobs, people like them didn't believe in Christianity, see, it was just not done, nobody did it except here's a few hundred people that were doing it. So what are we going to do about that? And suddenly Redeemer itself sometimes was a burning bush, you could just see little paradigm meltdowns, you know, it was coming out of their ears, you know, the paradigm, the old paradigm, there was a shift going on, they couldn't quite account for people that were, you know, we weren't brilliant, we're just normal, and normal people don't have these beliefs, how could you believe that?

Or sometimes a Christian comes into your life and maybe you're not a believer, and the Christian is just so much more wise or so much more poised or so much more intelligent and we're so much more thoughtful than you thought Christians could be and the Christian itself is like a burning bush. We're very often, one more thing before going on, very often disillusioning and difficult experiences, very often they're the burning bush. They come into your life and you're saying, look, I don't know if there's a God, there might be, there might not, I don't need to know God, that's your grid, which means your assumption is I can handle life, I can handle life, you know, I'm smart, I'm savvy, you know, I've got, I've got a therapist, you know, I've got friends, you know, I'm not stupid, you know, I know life isn't easy but I can handle life.

David Martin Lloyd-Jones was a physician, a young physician in Britain in the 1920s. He became a Christian, he got converted and went into the ministry after that, but he tells about his conversion and a big part of it was this. He believed, well, a big part of it was this, a man that he admired, an older man who was a physician and everything he wanted to be, you see, in that day and time, the best physicians in Britain, they were heroes, they were emulated, they were, you know, they were saving lives, they were respected, they were brilliant, they were, they were well paid, they had enormous status and it was one of those men that Lloyd-Jones looked up to and wanted to be like, he was dating a woman and she died, great tragedy.

He came by to see Lloyd-Jones and he says, hey, it'd be okay if I stayed here for a little bit and Lloyd-Jones says, oh, it's up to the fire and the man, Lloyd-Jones says, the man pulled up a chair to the fire and sat down and stared at the fire for two hours, didn't say a word. He also didn't act as if Lloyd-Jones was there. Now, Lloyd-Jones did not have his feelings hurt and he didn't feel, in any way, that was inappropriate.

It was perfectly appropriate but when he saw one of the men, that he, a world-beater, a person that he thought, that he wanted to be like and he realized this man was absolutely out of resources. He had nothing left. He had nothing with which to actually face the normal realities of life.

And Lloyd-Jones says, he looked at him staring at the fire and this is what he said. He says, I suddenly saw the vanity of all human greatness. I suddenly saw the vanity of all human greatness.

What was going on there? In that young man's mind, it was a burning bush. It was something that didn't fit.

He says, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, if a guy like this can't handle life, how in the world do I think I can handle life without God? So, but here's the point. When these things come into your life and they start to challenge you and they start to make you question the grid, are you willing to go over?

Like Moses. You know, if Moses hadn't gone over, if he actually said, I don't want to be bothered, he would have never heard of Moses. See, once you get bothered, you have to be willing to think it out.

You have to have the guts to think it out and be willing to think it out. We always say the gospel changes everything and we believe it really does. That's why here at Gospel and Life, August is Go and Share Month.

Throughout August, we're inviting thousands of our listeners to take a small step in sharing the gospel with someone God has placed in your life. For those of you who make a gift to Gospel and Life this month, we'll send you two copies of making sense of God by Tim Keller. It's a powerful resource that explores how Christianity makes emotional, cultural, and rational sense in today's world.

It's our thanks for your gift and provides a way you can do a small act to share the gospel by reading the book with a friend, giving one to a coworker or passing on both copies to people who are exploring the Christian faith. It's a simple way to start a gospel conversation or continue it. To request your two copies of making sense of God, simply go to gospelandlife.com-slash-give.

Again, that's gospelandlife.com-slash-give. Now, here's Dr. Keller with the remainder of today's teaching.

现在,与神的关系就是这样,通常,通常某些东西进入你的生命,它是一个燃烧的荆棘,你无法解释它。你有一套信念,要么你不相信神,要么你相信可能有一位神但没人知道,你要么有一个无关紧要的神,要么你没有神,或者类似的东西,一个你不需要认识就能生活的神。然后某些东西进入你的生命,你无法解释它。它可能是一连串的思想,我们在过去几周谈论过这个,你知道,奥登,二战期间住在上东区,伟大的英国诗人,不相信神,但二战来了,我们在过去几周详细谈论过这个。

二战来了,奥登看到纳粹他们在做什么,他说,等一下,没有神,我有什么权利说我的价值观是对的,有错的?如果没有神,我有什么依据说我是对的,他们是错的?所以他这样想,如果没有神,所有道德都是相对的,但不,道德不是相对的,他们所做的是错的,因此必定有一位神。

一连串的思想出现了,不符合他的网格,他有了一个范式转变。他有了一个改变,他质疑了网格本身。所以它可以是一种智力上的燃烧荆棘,一连串的思想,但非常经常是别的东西。多年前当救赎主开始时,我们有几百人,你知道,实际上在早期,我的意思是最初几年,这个团体大约是救赎主的大小,整个救赎主。

而我们,这是80年代末,90年代初,我们只是普通的纽约人,我们是在华尔街工作的人,在艺术界工作,你知道,在时尚界工作,只是普通的纽约人。但我过去发现如果你带一个人进来,平均来说99.9%的普通男人晚上不相信历史性的基督教或任何类似的东西。但如果他们进来,他们只是坐下来,他们意识到我们所有人都相信历史性的基督教,他们在那里大约10或15分钟,他们开始有范式转变。救赎主本身就是一个燃烧的荆棘,你知道为什么吗?

因为在他们的网格中,像他们这样的人,去过同样学校的人,做同样工作的人,像他们这样的人不相信基督教,看,那只是不被接受,没人这样做,除了这里有几百人在这样做。那我们该怎么办呢?突然救赎主本身有时就是一个燃烧的荆棘,你可以看到小的范式崩溃,你知道,从他们耳朵里冒出来,你知道,范式,旧范式,正在发生转变,他们无法完全解释这些人,你知道,我们不聪明,我们只是普通人,而普通人没有这些信念,你怎么能相信那个?

或者有时一个基督徒进入你的生命,也许你不是一个信徒,而这个基督徒比你想象的基督徒可以成为的要聪明得多,或沉着得多,或聪明得多,或体贴得多,而这个基督徒本身就像一个燃烧的荆棘。我们非常经常,在继续之前还有一件事,非常经常幻灭和困难的经历,非常经常它们是燃烧的荆棘。它们进入你的生命,你在说,看,我不知道是否有神,可能有,可能没有,我不需要认识神,那是你的网格,这意味着你的假设是我可以处理生活,我可以处理生活,你知道,我聪明,我精明,你知道,我有,我有一个治疗师,你知道,我有朋友,你知道,我不笨,你知道,我知道生活不容易但我可以处理生活。

大卫·马丁·劳埃德-琼斯是一位医生,20世纪20年代英国的一位年轻医生。他成为了一名基督徒,他归信了,之后进入了事工,但他讲述他的归信,其中一个重要部分是这样的。他相信,嗯,其中一个重要部分是这样的,一个他钦佩的男人,一个年长的男人,他是一位医生,是他想成为的一切,你看,在那个时代,英国最好的医生,他们是英雄,他们被效仿,他们,你知道,他们在拯救生命,他们受尊敬,他们很聪明,他们,他们收入很高,他们有巨大的地位,就是那些男人之一,劳埃德-琼斯仰望他,想成为像他一样,他在和一个女人约会,她死了,巨大的悲剧。

他来看劳埃德-琼斯,他说,嘿,如果我在这里待一会儿可以吗,劳埃德-琼斯说,哦,靠着火吧,这个男人,劳埃德-琼斯说,这个男人拉了一把椅子到火边坐下,盯着火看了两个小时,一句话都没说。他也没有表现得好像劳埃德-琼斯在那里。现在,劳埃德-琼斯的感情没有受到伤害,他也不觉得,以任何方式,那是不合适的。

那是完全合适的,但当他看到他仰望的人之一,一个世界征服者,一个他想成为的人,他意识到这个人完全没有资源了。他什么都没有了。他没有任何东西可以实际面对生活的正常现实。

劳埃德-琼斯说,他看着他盯着火,这是他所说的。他说,我突然看到了所有人类伟大的虚空。我突然看到了所有人类伟大的虚空。

那里发生了什么?在那个年轻人的心中,那是一个燃烧的荆棘。那是某些不符合的东西。

他说,等一下,等一下,等一下,如果像这样的人都无法处理生活,我怎么会认为我可以在没有神的情况下处理生活?所以,但这是重点。当这些东西进入你的生命,它们开始挑战你,它们开始让你质疑网格,你愿意过去吗?

像摩西一样。你知道,如果摩西没有过去,如果他实际上说,我不想被打扰,你就永远不会听说过摩西。看,一旦你被打扰,你必须愿意把它想清楚。

你必须有勇气把它想清楚,愿意把它想清楚。我们总是说福音改变一切,我们真的相信它确实如此。这就是为什么在"生命中的福音",八月是"去与分享月"。

整个八月,我们邀请数千名听众迈出一小步,与神放在你生命中的某人分享福音。对于那些本月向"生命中的福音"捐赠的人,我们将送给你两本提摩太·凯勒的《理解神》。这是一个强大的资源,探讨基督教如何在当今世界中在情感上、文化上和理性上都说得通。

这是我们对你捐赠的感谢,并提供了一种方式,你可以通过与朋友一起阅读这本书,把一本送给同事,或把两本都传递给正在探索基督教信仰的人来做一个分享福音的小行动。这是开始福音对话或继续它的简单方式。要索取你的两本《理解神》,只需前往gospelandlife.com-slash-give。

再次,那是gospelandlife.com-slash-give。现在,这是凯勒博士今天教导的剩余部分。

## 愿意转向一旁 / The Willingness to Turn Aside

Barbara Brown Taylor, in her famous sermon on the burning bush, says, imagine if Moses had just hunched down over his shoulders and kept his head down and just stayed busy. What if Moses had said, burning bush? I didn't really see it.

I don't know what that is. Burning bush? Well, probably there's some rational explanation anyway.

Burning bush. I've been paid to watch sheep, not turn aside and look at bushes. Burning bush, would somebody please put that out?

If he had done that, you never would have heard of him. He would never met God. God would never have spoken to him and the same thing would happen to you.

He got to turn aside, okay? So I disrupting sight. Second and third, they kind of go together.

芭芭拉·布朗·泰勒在她关于燃烧荆棘的著名讲道中说,想象一下如果摩西只是耸着肩膀低着头继续忙碌。如果摩西说,燃烧的荆棘?我真的没看到它。

我不知道那是什么。燃烧的荆棘?嗯,可能有什么理性的解释。

燃烧的荆棘。我被雇来看羊,不是转向一旁去看荆棘。燃烧的荆棘,有人可以把那个扑灭吗?

如果他那样做了,你永远不会听说过他。他永远不会遇见神。神永远不会对他说话,同样的事情会发生在你身上。

他必须转向一旁,好吗?所以我打扰的景象。第二和第三,它们有点联系在一起。

## 扩展的神的概念 / An Expanding Concept of God

Second and third, if you're really going to meet God, secondly, you have to have an expanding concept of God. Now, what do I mean by expanding concept? Well, let's look at this idea of God revealing himself as fire.

Why does God reveal himself as fire? One of the reasons is he's getting across one of the most mind-numbing, amazing things that the Bible says about God. See, the reason Moses went to see the bush was bushes are usually dependent on the, I mean, pardon me, fire is usually dependent on the bush.

It's dependent on the bush for fuel. And therefore, fires don't stay going forever because they have to have fuel. And after they consume the fuel, they're gone.

Why? They're dependent on the fuel. But this fire wasn't dependent on the bush.

It wasn't dependent on anything. It had its own power of being within it, which of course was a miracle. But what is that symbolized?

And symbolizes what God says about himself at the very end. When Moses says, well, who should I say has sent me to Israel? What's your name in other words?

And you know what God says? I'll tell you what my name is. He says, I am who I am.

Tell them, I am has sent you. Now it's actually really hard to translate this. What God really gives Moses, actually, as his name, is just the Hebrew verb to be.

It's like he's almost saying, tell them being itself sent you. I am what I am, I am who I am, but basically being itself. And here's what he's saying.

I depend on nothing. Everything depends on me. I am self-sufficient.

I have the power of all being in myself. I am the ground of all being. You know, when the Bible says God has no ending, we can kind of imagine that, I guess.

But when the Bible says God has no beginning, that's where my brain starts to melt. But it has to be, why? Because if something has a beginning, it's because something begins it.

And if God had a beginning and something would have begun God, and whatever that something was, God would have been dependent on, but God is saying, I am dependent on nothing. All existence has its existence only in me. I'm at the heart of every molecule.

I'm holding everything together. Hebrew is one one talks about that. In him, all things consist.

And so what God is trying to say here is that I am existence itself. I am being itself. I'm the ground of all being.

I'm not just a being, I am being. I'm not just a being, I am being. I am that I am.

Jesus put it slightly more personal terms without him you can do nothing. Now here's what I'm trying to say at this point. We could talk a lot about this, and this is the name that God reveals here.

But what I'm trying to show you is this, Moses is having an expanding understanding of God. He had a view of God, but what is this? In general, when people talk to me about not being able to believe in God.

In general, I can ask them, well tell me what you don't believe in, and tell me why it's hard to believe in God. And they always describe why I can't believe in a God who does this, I can't, and it's I'd say four times out of five, after they tell me what they don't like about God and why they can't believe in God. Four times out of five, I can say, oh, this is great.

I don't believe in that God either. The God you're talking about is not the God I believe in, they say what? That's always the God that people disbelieve in is a flat God, a reductionist to God, a reduced God.

Nothing like the multi-dimensional rich, rich God of the Bible. The Bible's talking about God is this, but he's also this, he's this, but he's also this, and paradoxically he's this, and he's also this, and the simpler your understanding of God is, the more rejectable it is. And I'll go so far as to say, the richer and more nuanced your understanding of God, the harder it is to reject him and the easier it is to believe in him.

Certainly, the harder it is to just reject him out of hand. And what Moses was getting is an expanding understanding of God, and you will, if you're expanding and you're understanding of God, and getting a richer understanding of God, you're moving in the right direction. So he had a disrupting side, he had an expanding concept.

第二和第三,如果你真的要遇见神,第二,你必须有一个扩展的神的概念。现在,我说扩展的概念是什么意思?好吧,让我们看看神将自己启示为火这个想法。

神为什么将自己启示为火?原因之一是他在传达圣经关于神所说的最令人麻木、最惊人的事情之一。看,摩西去看荆棘的原因是荆棘通常依赖于,我的意思是,对不起,火通常依赖于荆棘。

它依赖于荆棘作为燃料。因此,火不会永远持续,因为它们必须有燃料。在它们消耗了燃料之后,它们就消失了。

为什么?它们依赖于燃料。但这火不依赖于荆棘。

它不依赖于任何东西。它在自己内部有存在的力量,当然这是一个神迹。但那象征什么?

它象征神在最后对自己所说的话。当摩西说,那么我应该说谁派我到以色列?换句话说,你的名字是什么?

你知道神说什么吗?我会告诉你我的名字是什么。他说,我是自有永有的。

告诉他们,那自有的差遣了你。现在实际上很难翻译这个。神真正给摩西的,实际上,作为他的名字,只是希伯来动词"是"。

就像他几乎在说,告诉他们存在本身差遣了你。我是我所是的,我是我所是的,但基本上是存在本身。这是他在说的。

我不依赖任何东西。一切都依赖我。我是自足的。

我在自己里面有所有存在的力量。我是所有存在的根基。你知道,当圣经说神没有结束,我想我们可以想象那个。

但当圣经说神没有开始,那就是我的大脑开始融化的地方。但它必须是,为什么?因为如果某物有开始,那是因为某物开始了它。

如果神有开始,某物就会开始神,无论那某物是什么,神都会依赖于它,但神在说,我不依赖于任何东西。所有存在只在我里面有它的存在。我在每个分子的核心。

我把一切都维系在一起。希伯来书一章讲到这个。万有都在他里面得以维系。

所以神在这里试图说的是我是存在本身。我是存在本身。我是所有存在的根基。

我不只是一个存在,我是存在。我不只是一个存在,我是存在。我是自有永有的。

耶稣用稍微更个人化的术语表达,离了他你什么也不能做。现在这是我在这一点上试图说的。我们可以谈很多关于这个,这是神在这里启示的名字。

但我试图向你展示的是,摩西对神有一个扩展的理解。他对神有一个观点,但这是什么?一般来说,当人们和我谈论不能相信神时。

一般来说,我可以问他们,好吧,告诉我你不相信什么,告诉我为什么很难相信神。他们总是描述为什么我不能相信一个做这个的神,我不能,我会说五次中有四次,在他们告诉我他们不喜欢神什么以及为什么他们不能相信神之后。五次中有四次,我可以说,哦,这太好了。

我也不相信那个神。你说的神不是我相信的神,他们说什么?人们总是不相信的神是一个扁平的神,一个简化论的神,一个简化的神。

完全不像圣经中多维度的丰富、丰富的神。圣经谈论的神是这样,但他也是这样,他是这样,但他也是这样,悖论地他是这样,他也是这样,你对神的理解越简单,它就越容易被拒绝。我甚至会说,你对神的理解越丰富、越细致,就越难拒绝他,越容易相信他。

当然,越难仅仅断然拒绝他。摩西得到的是对神不断扩展的理解,而你会,如果你在扩展你对神的理解,得到更丰富的对神的理解,你就在朝正确的方向前进。所以他有一个打扰的景象,他有一个扩展的概念。

## 个人的问题:神的圣洁 / A Personal Problem: The Holiness of God

Thirdly, there was a personal problem. Now what do I mean by personal problem? Let's go back to the fire.

There are a number of things that God was getting across with fire, and here's one of them. Fire is so beautiful and so scary at once. It is so brilliant and so attractive and so dangerous and so frightening at once.

Look. Moses said, here I am, verse 5, do not come any closer, God said, take off your sandals for the place where you were standing is holy ground. At this Moses hit his face because he was afraid to look at God.

Now Alec Matier, great Old Testament Bible scholar, says about this verse, that the holiness of God is that part of God's nature that is dangerous for sinners like you and me. The holiness of God is that part of God's nature that is dangerous to sinners like you and me. And only we hear that, we New Yorkers say, I want a loving God, what do you mean?

Dangerous? Dangerous? He's like fire.

He's beautiful, but he's dangerous. I don't think I like that, but actually, please think with me a little bit. Why is God dangerous?

Why is the holiness of God his terrifying danger? Well, first two reasons. The holiness of God, first of all, means he exposes us through his perfection.

Come on, you know what this word, how this works. Whenever you're in the presence of absolute, incredible talent or beauty or brilliance, when you're in the presence of a human being with excellence, it's just like fire. Why?

It's wonderful and it's horrible. Look, you may think of yourself as not too bad looking person, then there's some people you don't want to stand near them because you don't want people looking from you to him or to her. You don't want that.

You know, you feel like I'm not so bad looking and then you get near somebody who makes you ten times better looking and then you feel homely ugly. You may think of yourself as talented, you know, this is one of the true story, of course, is that it happens very often. You may be the best violinist in hot coffee, Texas, little town, you know, and you get off the train in New York City and there's somebody begging, you know, and grand social station, you know, with a violin case open and people throw money in, they're playing and they're way better than you.

And you go, oh no, what's happening? It's beautiful. I mean, violinist is beautiful.

You say, well, that's beautiful, the technique, but you're scared to death. Whenever you get into the presence of something way better than you, it's horrible and wonderful. Well, how would that be true of God?

Of course it is. And this is one of the ways you know you're drawing near to the real God. When Isaiah went in to see the Holy One, high and lifted up, holy, holy, holy, he heard the angel saying, he went into the temple and he saw the holiness of God and you've got a figure.

Isaiah, he's a prophet. Isaiah, compared to the most of the population, he would have to be more virtuous, more spiritual, more moral, a better person than most, but what does he say about himself? Unclean, he calls himself.

Everything that Isaiah was proud of looked like trash. Because in the presence of power, you feel your weakness in the presence of beauty, you feel your ugliness in the presence of light, you feel your darkness. And therefore God's dangerous because he is so holy and so perfect and so beautiful that he's horrible.

Because when you get near him, you have a self-quake, your self-image falls apart. All the things you tell yourself, I'm not that bad a person, it's not true. It's just not true and you realize it's not true.

All your self-justifications, all your little self-deceptions, the blindness we all have. Everybody knows that. We always sort of, that person is awful, that person is awful, but me, you have to understand.

You're always making excuses for yourself, but in the presence of God, it's incredibly traumatic. It's like a logically absolutely devastating. It's incredibly dangerous because God is so beautiful, He is dangerous.

He shows you who you are. So His perfection exposes you, but also He is a God of active goodness. The difference between active and passive goodness, there's been a lot of studies that during the Holocaust in Germany, most Germans felt bad about the fact that the Jews were disappearing.

They justified it. They told themselves, well, they're just going to detention camps, I mean, they always, they lied to themselves so they didn't want to admit, but basically, most Germans saw the Jews just disappearing. They saw the Jewish neighbors just disappearing and they felt bad about it.

Why? People, but they're passively good. They didn't say anything.

They didn't make waves. They were afraid to. As we all know, passive goodness isn't as good as active goodness and God is actively good.

God is not just good in general. He doesn't tolerate evil, He doesn't tolerate evil in sin in you. And as a result, there's a danger.

---

第三,有一个个人的问题。现在我说个人问题是什么意思?让我们回到火。

神通过火传达了许多东西,这是其中之一。火同时是如此美丽又如此可怕。它同时是如此辉煌、如此吸引人、如此危险、如此令人恐惧。

看。摩西说,我在这里,第5节,不要近前来,神说,当把你脚上的鞋脱下来,因为你所站之地是圣地。摩西就蒙上脸,因为怕看神。

现在亚历克·莫蒂尔,伟大的旧约圣经学者,关于这节经文说,神的圣洁是神本性中对像你我这样的罪人来说危险的那部分。神的圣洁是神本性中对像你我这样的罪人来说危险的那部分。只有我们听到这个,我们纽约人说,我想要一个慈爱的神,你什么意思?

危险?危险?他就像火。

他是美丽的,但他是危险的。我不认为我喜欢那个,但实际上,请和我想一想。为什么神是危险的?

为什么神的圣洁是他可怕的危险?嗯,首先两个原因。神的圣洁,首先,意味着他通过他的完美暴露我们。

来吧,你知道这个词,这是如何工作的。每当你在绝对的、令人难以置信的才能或美丽或辉煌的面前时,当你在一个有卓越的人的面前时,它就像火。为什么?

它是美好的,它是可怕的。看,你可能认为自己是一个长得还不错的人,然后有些人你不想站在他们附近,因为你不想让人们从你看到他或她。你不想那样。

你知道,你觉得我长得还不错,然后你靠近一个让你看起来好看十倍的人,然后你觉得又土又丑。你可能认为自己有才华,你知道,这当然是一个真实的故事,这经常发生。你可能是德克萨斯州热咖啡小镇最好的小提琴手,你知道,小镇,你知道,你在纽约市下火车,有人在乞讨,你知道,在中央车站,你知道,小提琴盒打开,人们往里面扔钱,他们在演奏,他们比你好得多。

你说,哦不,发生了什么?这很美。我的意思是,小提琴手很美。

你说,嗯,那很美,技术,但你吓坏了。每当你进入比你好得多的东西的面前,它是可怕和美好的。那么这对神来说会是真的吗?

当然是。这是你知道你正在接近真神的方式之一。当以赛亚进去看至高至大的圣者,圣哉,圣哉,圣哉,他听到天使在说,他进入圣殿,他看到了神的圣洁,你得弄清楚。

以赛亚,他是一个先知。以赛亚,与大多数人相比,他必须更有德行,更属灵,更有道德,一个比大多数人更好的人,但他对自己说什么?不洁,他称自己。

以赛亚引以为豪的一切看起来都像垃圾。因为在能力的面前,你感到你的软弱;在美的面前,你感到你的丑陋;在光的面前,你感到你的黑暗。因此神是危险的,因为他如此圣洁、如此完美、如此美丽,以至于他是可怕的。

因为当你靠近他时,你有一次自我地震,你的自我形象崩溃。你告诉自己的所有事情,我不是那么坏的人,都不是真的。那只是不真实,你意识到那不真实。

你所有的自我辩护,你所有的小自我欺骗,我们所有人都有的盲目。每个人都知道这一点。我们总是有点,那个人很糟糕,那个人很糟糕,但我,你必须理解。

你总是为自己找借口,但在神的面前,这是令人难以置信的创伤。这在逻辑上是绝对毁灭性的。这是令人难以置信的危险,因为神如此美丽,他是危险的。

他向你展示你是谁。所以他的完美暴露了你,但他也是一位主动良善的神。主动和被动良善之间的区别,有很多研究表明,在德国的大屠杀期间,大多数德国人对犹太人消失的事实感到难过。

他们为自己辩护。他们告诉自己,嗯,他们只是去拘留营,我的意思是,他们总是,他们对自己撒谎,所以他们不想承认,但基本上,大多数德国人看到犹太人就这样消失了。他们看到犹太邻居就这样消失,他们对此感到难过。

为什么?人们,但他们是被动的好人。他们什么也没说。

他们没有兴风作浪。他们害怕。正如我们都知道的,被动的良善不如主动的良善好,而神是主动良善的。

神不仅仅是一般意义上的良善。他不容忍邪恶,他不容忍你里面的邪恶和罪。因此,有一种危险。

## 遇见真神,而非定制神 / Encountering the Real God, Not a Custom-Made One

Now here's the third point, very important. If you're going to have an experience of God and counter God, it really ought to be a real God. We are so affected by consumer capitalism and in consumer capitalism, we choose everything.

We get what we want. Everything's customized to us. And so you don't you see what we tend to do?

I do it. Can't you do it? You get the God you want.

You say, I don't like to believe in God like this. I like to believe in God like this. I hear people say this.

I like to think of God like this. I like to think of God like this. If you're creating your own God, it's just an extension of you.

How's that guy going to be of any help to you? How's that guy going to give you any power? It's just you.

How's that guy going to be any resource? It's just you. If you're actually just creating God you like.

So how are you going to be sure that you're drawing near to a real God, a real spiritual reality, a true God, a living God? How are you going to know that? And Jonathan Edwards, the great 18th century theologian philosopher says that most of the attributes of God are attributes that we would choose if we were creating a God.

You know, it'd be nice to have a powerful God because then if he's your God, then he can help you. It'd be nice to have a merciful God, then if you're guilty he can forgive you. Almost all the attributes are attributes that we would choose, but there's one attribute we would never choose, Edwards says, it's the holiness of God because it's just a problem.

The holiness is nothing but a problem, a big problem for us and if you are starting to sense that this God that you're trying to come to grips with is holy and that you're not just a good person who needs a spiritual boost from him and you're not just even a needy person who needs fulfillment but that you're a sinner and you need forgiveness and pardon. And you begin to actually sense that there's a problem and you've got a problem coming into his presence. Now you have some confidence that you're not making this God up.

Now you've got some confidence that you're on your way toward the real God because you sense that you've got a personal problem, he's not just an abstraction, he's just trying to believe in him but you've got a problem in relating to him.

---

现在这是第三点,非常重要。如果你要有一个对神的经历,遇见神,它真的应该是一个真神。我们如此受消费资本主义的影响,在消费资本主义中,我们选择一切。

我们得到我们想要的。一切都为我们定制。所以你看不到我们倾向于做什么吗?

我这样做。你不这样做吗?你得到你想要的神。

你说,我不喜欢相信这样的神。我喜欢相信这样的神。我听人们这样说。

我喜欢把神想成这样。我喜欢把神想成这样。如果你在创造自己的神,那只是你的延伸。

那个家伙怎么能帮助你?那个家伙怎么能给你任何力量?那只是你。

那个家伙怎么能成为任何资源?那只是你。如果你实际上只是在创造你喜欢的神。

那么你怎么能确定你正在接近一个真神,一个真实的属灵实在,一个真神,一个活神?你怎么知道呢?乔纳森·爱德华兹,伟大的18世纪神学家哲学家说,神的大多数属性都是如果我们在创造一个神我们会选择的属性。

你知道,有一个大能的神会很好,因为那样如果他是你的神,那么他可以帮助你。有一个怜悯的神会很好,那样如果你有罪他可以赦免你。几乎所有的属性都是我们会选择的属性,但有一个属性我们永远不会选择,爱德华兹说,那就是神的圣洁,因为那只是一个问题。

圣洁对我们来说只是一个问题,一个大问题,如果你开始感觉到这位你试图理解的神是圣洁的,而你不只是一个需要他属灵提升的好人,你甚至不只是一个需要满足的有需要的人,而是你是一个罪人,你需要赦免和宽恕。你开始实际感觉到有一个问题,你进入他面前有一个问题。现在你有一些信心,你不是在编造这个神。

现在你有一些信心,你正在走向真神,因为你感觉到你有一个个人问题,他不只是一个抽象,他只是试图相信他,但你在与他建立关系方面有一个问题。

## 令人惊讶的恩典:耶和华的使者 / A Surprising Grace: The Angel of the Lord

And that brings us naturally then the last thing you need would be you need some kind of grace, you need something that will enable you to stand in God's presence. Moses is wondering about that. Down here in verse 11 and 12, Moses says, but who am I that you would send me to Pharaoh and then God says, I will be with you but if you go on in the text, you'll see Moses is not modified here.

Moses says, wait a minute, you're holy. He's starting to see who he is, what he's like and he begins to say, how in the world am I? Well put it like this, the bush is not consumed but why isn't Moses?

In Exodus 33, Moses actually asked God, can I see you face to face and God says no, you can't, it will kill you. Well then why is it not consumed right here? The bush isn't consumed, okay, it was a miracle but why isn't Moses consumed and the secret and the answer, it's in the text but you probably went right by it, I do.

Look all through here, it says God spoke to Moses out of the bush. God spoke to Moses out of the bush, God spoke to Moses out of the bush but who's actually in the bush? It tells you in verse 2, the angel of the Lord.

Wait a minute you say that's weird, it says the angel was in the bush but then all the way through the rest of the text it talks as if God's in the bush, yes, that's the way it works in the Old Testament. There's this figure, this enigmatic figure named the angel of the Lord, not an angel of the Lord, like Gabriel or somebody like that, the angel of the Lord and when the angel of the Lord shows up, it's weird because on the one hand this angel of the Lord seems to be a distinct person from God, on the other hand the angel of the Lord seems to be God. Like it'll say the angel of the Lord spoke to Abraham or the angel of the Lord spoke to Moses but then the very next verse it'll say and God said to Moses and God said Abraham, it's almost as if this person is both God and not God.

But here's what's all so interesting, Alec Matier says, if you look carefully, the angel of the Lord shows up when God wants to draw near to someone without destroying them. One of the most interesting spots is later on in the book of Exodus, Matier says there's this argument going back and forth between Moses and God and Moses says, Lord, you must your presence must go with us as the children of Israel leave Egypt and go toward the promised line. Your presence must go with us and God says no.

My presence cannot go with you because you are rebellious people and my presence will destroy you. And then Moses pushes back and says no, no, I'm not going to go unless you go with us and then finally God says, Matier points this out in his commentary on Exodus. He finally says, wait, okay, I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

I'll send my angel with you. And here's what Matier says about that. Moses says, I want your presence.

God says no, it'll destroy you. Most I want your presence. Okay, I'll send you my angel.

And here's what Matier says in his commentary. He says the angel of the Lord is revealed as the merciful accommodation of God whereby the Lord can be present among a sinful people when were he to go with them himself. God's presence would consume them.

So the angel is that mode of deity whereby the holy God can keep company with sinners without destroying them. And then Matier goes on and says, who would that be? He says there is only one other in the Bible who is both identical with and yet distinct from the Lord.

One who while affirming the wrath of God is yet a supreme display of his mercy. The angel of the Lord can only be understood as a pre-incarnate appearance of Jesus Christ. And do you remember in John chapter 8, Jesus says to his listeners, before Abraham was I am.

He doesn't say before Abraham was I was. That would have been weird enough. But he says before Abraham was I am.

And what is he saying? He's saying, I'm the one who spoke to Moses from the bush. And now here's the secret.

Here's the answer to all the riddles. You say, well, how is Jesus Christ the angel of the Lord? How is Jesus Christ the way that we can be in the presence of God without being consumed?

Oh my goodness, here it is. Here's how you can finally see the fire of God. Fire is terrible and beautiful.

And on the cross you see how terribly holy God is. He is so terribly holy that Jesus Christ had to die. God is actively good.

God has to meet out punishment on sin. Just can't be shrugged at. He is so terribly holy, Jesus had to die, but he is so beautifully loving, so beautifully loving that in Jesus Christ he was willing to come and glad to die, willing to die, make his own atonement.

And there it is. We have hymns about this. One hymn goes, before the throne absolved we stand, thy love has met, thy laws demand.

Terrible, horrible, beautiful, gorgeous, and if you want to know the ravishing beauty of this fiery God, a God who wants so holy that you got a problem with him and yet so loving that he solved the problem at his own expense. If you say, I want to know that God, you will come to know that God, why? Because that's the God who reveals himself to Moses in the bush and that's the God who reveals himself to people.

这自然地带我们来到最后一件你需要的事,你需要某种恩典,你需要某种能使你站在神面前的东西。摩西在想这个。在这里第11和12节,摩西说,我算什么,你竟打发我去见法老,然后神说,我必与你同在。但如果你继续读经文,你会看到摩西并没有在这里被安慰。

摩西说,等一下,你是圣洁的。他开始看到他是谁,他是什么样子,他开始说,我到底怎么能?好吧这样说,荆棘没有被烧毁,但为什么摩西没有被烧毁?

在出埃及记33章,摩西实际上问神,我可以面对面见你吗,神说不,你不能,那会杀死你。那么为什么摩西在这里没有被烧毁?荆棘没有被烧毁,好的,那是一个神迹,但为什么摩西没有被烧毁?秘密和答案,在经文中,但你可能直接过去了,我也是。

看这里到处都是,它说神从荆棘中对摩西说话。神从荆棘中对摩西说话,神从荆棘中对摩西说话,但实际上谁在荆棘中?它在第2节告诉你,耶和华的使者。

等一下你说那很奇怪,它说使者在荆棘中,但然后在经文的其余部分它说得好像神在荆棘中,是的,这就是它在旧约中的运作方式。有这个人物,这个神秘的人物叫做耶和华的使者,不是耶和华的一个使者,像加百列或类似的人,而是耶和华的使者。当耶和华的使者出现时,很奇怪,因为一方面这位耶和华的使者似乎是与神不同的一个人,另一方面耶和华的使者似乎就是神。就像它会说耶和华的使者对亚伯拉罕说话,或耶和华的使者对摩西说话,但然后下一节经文它会说神对摩西说,神对亚伯拉罕说,就好像这个人既是神又不是神。

但这里非常有趣的是,亚历克·莫蒂尔说,如果你仔细看,耶和华的使者出现是当神想要接近某人而不毁灭他们时。最有趣的地方之一是后来在出埃及记中,莫蒂尔说有这个摩西和神之间来回的争论,摩西说,主啊,你必须,你的同在必须与我们同去,当以色列的子民离开埃及走向应许之地时。你的同在必须与我们同去,神说不。

我的同在不能与你们同去,因为你们是悖逆的百姓,我的同在会毁灭你们。然后摩西反驳说不,不,除非你与我们同去,否则我不去。然后最后神说,莫蒂尔在他关于出埃及记的注释中指出这一点。他最后说,等等,好吧,我告诉你我要做什么。

我会差遣我的使者与你们同去。这是莫蒂尔关于这个说的话。摩西说,我要你的同在。

神说不,那会毁灭你。摩西说我要你的同在。好吧,我会差遣我的使者给你。

这是莫蒂尔在他的注释中说的。他说耶和华的使者被启示为神的怜悯调适,借此主可以在有罪的百姓中间,而如果他亲自与他们同去,神的同在会烧毁他们。

所以使者是神性的那种模式,借此圣洁的神可以与罪人同在而不毁灭他们。然后莫蒂尔继续说,那会是谁?他说圣经中只有一个既与主相同又与主有别的。

一位在肯定神的忿怒的同时又是他怜悯的至高显明。耶和华的使者只能被理解为耶稣基督道成肉身前的显现。你还记得在约翰福音第8章,耶稣对他的听众说,还没有亚伯拉罕,就有了我。

他没有说还没有亚伯拉罕,就有了我。那已经够奇怪了。但他说还没有亚伯拉罕,就有了我。

他在说什么?他在说,我就是从荆棘中对摩西说话的那一位。现在这是秘密。

这是所有谜题的答案。你说,嗯,耶稣基督怎么是耶和华的使者?耶稣基督怎么是我们可以在神的面前而不被烧毁的方式?

哦天哪,就是这样。这就是你最终如何看到神的火。火是可怕和美丽的。

在十字架上你看到神是多么可怕地圣洁。他是如此可怕地圣洁,以至于耶稣基督必须死。神是主动良善的。

神必须对罪施行惩罚。不能轻轻带过。他是如此可怕地圣洁,耶稣必须死,但他是如此美丽地慈爱,如此美丽地慈爱,以至于在耶稣基督里他愿意来,乐意死,愿意死,做他自己的赎罪。

就是这样。我们有关于这个的赞美诗。一首赞美诗这样唱,在宝座前我们蒙赦免站立,你的爱已经满足了你的律法的要求。

可怕,恐怖,美丽,华美,如果你想知道这位如火之神的令人陶醉的美,一位神如此圣洁以至于你与他有问题,然而又如此慈爱以至于他以自己的代价解决了问题。如果你说,我想认识那位神,你会来认识那位神,为什么?因为那就是在荆棘中向摩西启示自己的神,那就是向人启示自己的神。

## 成为燃烧的荆棘 / Becoming a Burning Bush

And guess what will happen if you do that? If you believe in Jesus Christ, you will become a burning bush. Moses did.

Moses went out and changed the world. Why? Because the glory and the beauty of God came into his life.

In fact, at one point he had to put a veil over his face and it didn't consume him. Why? Well, he wasn't really sure.

He just knew that somehow atonement had been made, but you and I know. Peter 1, verse 3 says, the Christians have been made partakers of the divine nature. Ephesians 2 says, we're temples of the Holy Spirit, the light and the uncommon light and the beauty and the glory of God can come into your life and yet you not be consumed because of the merits and mediation of Jesus Christ and then you become a little burning bush.

And you become someone who can, who people go over to see, to figure out because you're inexplicable. When you become someone who can touch others or have God touch others through you and you can change the world, do you believe in the God who revealed Himself to Moses and the burning bush with us pray? Father, we thank you for giving us this pathway to experience of you and we ask that you would help us now even as we participate in the Lord's Supper to know you.

That is an abstract God but is a fiery loving God. We pray that you would help every Christian here experience your reality and everyone here who is not yet know you also come to experience that reality we ask it in Jesus' name. Amen.

你猜如果你这样做会发生什么?如果你相信耶稣基督,你会成为一个燃烧的荆棘。摩西做到了。

摩西出去改变了世界。为什么?因为神的荣耀和美丽进入了他的生命。

事实上,有一次他不得不在脸上蒙上帕子,而它没有烧毁他。为什么?嗯,他真的不确定。

他只知道不知何故赎罪已经成就,但你和我知道。彼得前书1章3节说,基督徒已经有份于神的性情。以弗所书2章说,我们是圣灵的殿,神的光和不寻常的光以及美丽和荣耀可以进入你的生命,然而你不被烧毁,因为耶稣基督的功德和中保,然后你成为一个小燃烧的荆棘。

你成为一个人们会过去看的人,去弄明白,因为你是无法解释的。当你成为一个可以,人们可以通过你触摸他人或让神触摸他人的人,你可以改变世界,你相信那位向摩西和燃烧的荆棘启示自己的神吗?让我们一起祷告。父啊,我们感谢你给我们这条通向经历你的道路,我们祈求你现在帮助我们,甚至当我们参加圣餐时认识你。

那不是一个抽象的神,而是一位如火的慈爱的神。我们祈求你帮助这里的每一位基督徒经历你的真实,也帮助这里每一位还不认识你的人也来经历那个真实。我们奉耶稣的名祈求。阿们。
