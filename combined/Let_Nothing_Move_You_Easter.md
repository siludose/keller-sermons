Turn in the bullet into the passage of Scripture on which the teaching is based. First Corinthians 15. Now, there's three basic things that Paul says about the resurrection.

Now, the musicians know what they are, don't you? The musicians have heard this three times. And they are so holy that tonight, when they turn off the lights, they're going to glow in the dark.

But you don't know what those three things are yet. And so, just to get a little bit of the effulgence of the musicians to get your cut, let's read. First Corinthians 15.

For what I received, I passed on to you as of first importance, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He appeared to Peter, and then to the twelve. And after that, He appeared to more than 500 of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead.

And the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep, for since death, came through a man. The resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.

But each in his own turn, Christ the first fruits, then when He comes those who belong to Him, then the end will come when He hands over the kingdom to God the Father after He has destroyed all dominion, authority and power, for He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death. Listen, I tell you a mystery.

We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed in a flash. In the twinkle of an eye, at the last trumpet, for the trumpet will sound. The dead will be raised in perishable, and we will be changed.

For the perishable must close itself with imperishable, and the mortal with immortality. And when the perishable has been clothed within the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true. Death is swallowed up in victory.

Where O death is your victory, where O death is your sting. The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law, but thanks be to God. He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

Therefore my dear brothers stand firm, but nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain. Now, what Paul does here is he answers three questions, and it's a long chapter, and I've only pulled a couple of pieces out, and you could do worse than to read the whole chapter on Easter Sunday.

First Corinthians 15, maybe the great chapter in the whole Bible on the meaning of the resurrection of Jesus. And he answers three questions about Jesus' resurrection. Did he do it?

What did it do? And what should we do about it? See, did it happen, in other words, what did it accomplish, and what should we do about it?

Now, those three things hang together, though I'd like to concentrate tonight on the last point. But see, here's how they hang together. First of all, Paul, in the first few verses, tries to explain that if you're going to get the benefits of the resurrection in your life, if it's really going to make a difference in your life, if it's really going to change you, you have to believe it actually happened.

That's the reason he goes to the trouble in the very beginning of saying, look, I received. Now, these are technical Greek verbs, actually. He chooses verbs when he says, I received, and I passed on to you.

These are verbs that mean I researched, I got information, and I passed it on. I talked to the eyewitnesses. I talked to 500.

He says, 500 Christians who are still alive when I'm writing this, which is 20 years after Jesus' death and resurrection, who are still there, you can still go and ask them. See, when Paul makes this sort of public claim in a publicly circulated letter, when he says, look, there are 500 witnesses, go and talk to them if you want. They all saw Jesus at once after he had been raised from the dead.

What is Paul doing? He was saying, it matters. It matters whether you believe it really happened.

The average person in New York City believes the resurrection is a wonderful concept. It's a symbol. It's a symbol of good triumphing over bad.

It's a symbol that you can have a new start after a disaster. If you want a little example of it, of that view of the resurrection, it's the New York Times lead editorial today. It says, well, Christians have always celebrated the fact that here was a man who stood against tyranny.

Since Christians are not supposed to be sensitive, that would be an insult and therefore it's not. But if we were sensitive, it would be an insult. Paul goes to great pains and says, if you have a comfortable little life, the symbol of the resurrection, meaning just how good things overcome bad things eventually, might be a some comfort.

In your life with concrete trouble, concrete trials, concrete, real death coming at you, unless you believe in a concrete, real physical, literal, historical resurrection, you're not going to be any different. You're not going to be able to handle real trouble unless you believe in a real resurrection. You can't believe the resurrection is just a beautiful symbol but didn't happen literally or physically.

Paul goes out of his way to say, like in verse 20, but Christ has risen indeed. That's why we say, not just he's risen, indeed he's risen, really risen, actually risen. His body rekindled and he walked out.

And Paul's here saying, the reason he lays all these verses down in the very beginning is, he says unless you believe it, it's not going to change you. That's the first point. Now, the second point is not only does he say, you have to believe it happen, but he also says, you have to believe or have to understand what it accomplished.

The resurrection isn't just something that happened. It's not just a naked display of power, it accomplishes something. And what is it accomplish?

Well, there's two things that Paul says happen, the resurrection accomplishes. The first one, he says in verse 17, which I didn't print there unfortunately, where Paul says, if Christ has not raised from the dead, you're still in your sins. In fact, he says it in a very vivid way.

He says, if Christ is still in the ground, you are still in your sins. Why would that be? Because the resurrection proves that something is over.

What's over? It says in Romans 4.25, Jesus was put to death for our sins, but he was raised for our justification. What's that mean?

It means this. When you see death, when you get near death, when you go to a funeral with somebody you know, no matter who they are. In spite of the fact that this society will tell you death is natural, it's a normal part of living, you know it's not.

Death is unnatural, death isn't right. We don't want to die, we don't want to say our loved ones die. There's something abnormal about it.

Death forbids us to rise, but we want to rise, but it forbids us to rise. Death pulls us down. Death isn't right.

That's the reason why that famous line of Dylan Thomas is so famous. Dylan Thomas says, we rage against the dying of the light. We rage, we know death isn't natural, but if it's not natural, then it's been inflicted.

So you know that death is a natural, but if death is a natural, then it's a judgment, then it's a punishment. And why? Well, the Bible answers that.

We have been put into a world that's built. It's built to work if we live not for ourselves, but for others and for God. We're built to serve other people and to preserve God.

That's not how we live. We live to serve ourselves and use other people in God to reach our needs and to get to our goals. And as a result, the world doesn't work.

And we don't work in death is a natural consequence. We're going against the warp and woof and fabric of a reality and the wages of that is disintegration. And disintegration is death.

And therefore, death has authority. Death is a judgment. When Jesus Christ died, Paul says, if he didn't rise, you're still in your sins.

Why? Here's why. If Jesus Christ had died, death would still be owed.

Death would still have authority. But when Jesus Christ rose, we already sang about it. Death in vain forbids him rise.

The last hymn, too, is great. It talks about death in vain. Death can't.

Why? Because justice has been paid. Judgment has been paid.

Jesus Christ, when he died, rendered everything necessary. And therefore, death in vain. Death has no power.

Death has no authority over us. And therefore, condemnation is done. See?

The resurrection means condemnation is over. The resurrection means that your sins have been paid for. God has satisfied you.

Actually, if you go to the Old Testament on one day of the year, all the people gathered, and the high priest came on Yom Kippur, and what do the high priest do? He went into the veil. What was behind the veil?

The Holy of Holies. Where was he going? He was going to a tone for the sins of the people.

And everybody was nervous. Why? Because he was going back before the raw presence of God.

Would the sacrifice be acceptable? Somebody waited with Bated Breath, and he went down. He almost went to a certain death.

He went into the veil. But after he had made the sacrifice every year, he came out. He came through.

And everybody rejoiced why? Because it meant that there's sins have been a tone for. But that was happening every year, over and over again, as the book of Hebrews says, in a way that can ever completely satisfy the conscience.

But when Jesus Christ went into the earth and came out, that was God's way of saying to everybody, your sins have been paid in full. And that's the reason why, on the one hand, without the resurrection, you have absolutely no confidence that God looks at you right now and is satisfied and accepts you. But on the other hand, the resurrection does not just prove that something is over.

It proves that something has begun. It goes in verse 20 to 23. Twice.

We're told Jesus Christ is the first fruits. Now what's the first fruits? Wow.

Here's what the first fruits mean. There is a world. There is an eternal world.

A world of complete justice. A world of complete love. A world where nothing gets old and dies into case.

World of life and truth and beauty. But it's the ideal world. And this is the real world.

And everybody knows that there's a concrete slab between the real world and the ideal world. But when Jesus rose from the dead, this was not just fireworks. This was not just a naked display of power.

This was the ideal breaking into the real Jesus Christ is the first fruits. What are the first fruits? It's the first thing out of the garden.

It's the first thing out of the grain. It's the first fruit of the vine. It's what's about to come.

It's the reality. It's really part of the harvest, even though it's not in there in fullness. And what it means is the future of God has landed.

In the resurrection, a hole was punched in the pitiless walls of the world. And into a world of decay has come immortality. Into a world of darkness has come light.

And when Jesus Christ says, believe in me and you'll receive the resurrection into your life. This is not just, you're going to get inspired. You're going to get a little happy.

You know, he's going to kind of give you strength to go through the day. Lift up your eyes. Give up your small ambitions.

The Bible says that Christians and the church is God's eschatological beechhead. That means the future eschatology, eschatological means his future has come in now. Partial but real.

First fruits, but only first. But really fruits, but only the first. But into the world now, when you become a Christian into your heart comes the fruit of the spirit.

And your life comes the gifts of the spirit. And your heart comes real, divine, future joy and love and glory. And when you have the gifts of the spirit, it means that when you care for other people, when you counsel other people, when you witness other people, when you teach other people, you're bringing the life of the future into their lives.

And the alienations of this world. The alienation where we're spiritually alienated from God, and we're psychologically alienated from our true selves, we're socially alienated from other races and classes and nationalities. Those things begin to get healed through the gifts of the spirit which are given to you because the future has come.

Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer? Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith? For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding of what it means to follow Christ.

A great resource to start using this summer is the new city catechism devotional. God's truth for our hearts and minds. This devotional brings the historic catechisms of the Christian Church to life, offering a question to consider for each week of the year.

In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catechesis, the rich and communal practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers that frame the foundational beliefs of the Christian faith. Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer, and a brief meditation that will challenge and inspire you. The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller, and Kevin De Young, as well as historical figures such as Augustine, John Calvin, and Martin Luther.

This month, in addition to the new city catechism devotional, we are including a great companion resource, the new city catechism for kids, as our thank you for your gift to help gospel and life share the hope of Christ's love with people all over the world. So, request your copies today at gospelonlife.com slash give. That's gospelonlife.com slash give.

Now, here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. The resurrection has brought the future into the present. The resurrection has brought you your justification.

So, what's over the condemnation and judgment forever? And what's begun? The kingdom.

That's right there in verses 20 to 24. The first fruits of what? The kingdom.

First, then, and finally, the full kingdom. That's what 20 to 24 says. Now, let's get to the last point because Paul is basically saying all of this to get to the end.

When you get to the end, he's saying, all right, what difference does this make in the way we live? And I love the word there in verse 58 or 59 where he says, therefore, my dear brothers, stand firm. Let nothing move you.

Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord. Therefore, what's there for? What's there for referring to?

Let me take a minute here. How do you deal with trouble? How do you become strong?

How do you face the troubles of life? How do you become immovable? How do you become someone who stands firm?

That's what Paul's talking about. How do you do it? How do you deal with the troubles of life?

You know, you just stiffen your upper lip. You say, I'm going to be tough. You just say, I'm a Christian.

I'm not going to let this get to me. That's not what Paul does. Paul doesn't say, you know, stiffen your upper lip and let nothing move you.

What is it, therefore, referring to? Therefore is all the theology of 1 Corinthians 15. See, when Paul says, I want you to become somebody who's strong.

He doesn't say just to fight the world. He says, think. He says, think to the glory of what God has done overwhelms you.

It's very holistic. Get your mind engaged until your heart gets so-or-flowing that your will becomes absolutely overwhelmingly strong. So when Paul said a little word, therefore, is referring back to all the 1 Corinthians and what he's really doing, the way most of us deal with trouble is we just defy.

It's just totally stoic. We work right with the will, not Paul. Paul says, you need hope.

And hope only comes from an understanding that this resurrection really happened and what it did. You know, one of my heroes is Sam, Gamgee and Lord of the Rings. And there's one place where he's just about at the end of his rope.

And he looks up into the stars and he sees something. It says, he crawled from the hiding place and he looked out. The land seemed full of creaking and cracking and sly noises.

He was in a terrible spot. It was, you don't need to know. But he says, they're peeping up among the cloud rack far above a dark tower in the mountains.

Sam saw a white star twinkle. The beauty of it smote his heart. As he looked up out of the forsaken land and hope returned to him, for like a shaft clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the end the shadow was only a small and passing thing.

There was light and high beauty forever beyond its reach. His song and the tower had been defiance rather than hope for then he was thinking of himself. Now for a moment, his own fate ceased to trouble him.

He crawled back into the brambles, laid himself down and putting away all fear. He cast himself into a deep untroubled sleep. Now there's a lot of nuances in there.

See, in the past, the way Sam had gotten strong was he was just defying. He worked directly on his will. But in the end, you notice it said, it said it was self-absorbed.

To be self-absorbed to say, I'm not going to sweat, I'm not going to sweat, I'm going to be okay, I'm going to be strong. But suddenly here, he got hope. What is hope?

A thought that pierced his heart. See, like a shaft clear and cold, the thought pierced his heart. That in the end the shadow was a small and passing thing and there was light and high beauty forever beyond its reach.

Now that is nothing but whistling in the dark unless the resurrection of Jesus Christ happened. And if it happened, then I suggest you look at it, like Sam looked at that star until the shaft pierces your heart and then you will be immovable. Nothing will bother you.

Let me just give you quickly some things that won't bother you that are mentioned here. First of all, your sins and flaws won't bother you. Do you believe in the resurrection?

You see? If Jesus is out, then God looks at you and is satisfied and accepts you and your sins and flaws won't bother you. You say, how does that work?

Imagine you're buying something in Macy's. Macy's a very, very big store and let's just say you bought something huge, some big object that you can't put in a bag. And you have to walk from where you are out to the street.

Now when you get to the street, you'll be all right. But on the way out, you know what they'll say? They'll take a receipt.

Why? Well, if a security man stops you or if a salesperson or somebody stops you and says, what are you doing with that? What you can do is you can wave your receipt and you can say, trouble me not.

I have paid for this. I don't owe a penny. I owe nothing.

I'm free and clear. What is the resurrection? It's your receipt.

Because you see, you're going to get questions. You're going to get lots of questions. You're going to get questions from the world.

You're going to get questions from the flesh and you're going to get questions from the devil. And the questions will come like this. It'll say, if anybody knew the kind of thoughts that go through your heart during the west side five o'clock service.

I notice somebody who's pretty attractive over there and I start to think about things and, wow, I can't believe it. Here I am in church. Oh my gosh.

Your own heart's going to come and say, what makes you think God loves you? Why would God love you? And as your heart starts to sink, you pull out your receipt, which is the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Trouble me not. Trouble me not. I'm paid for.

I'm free and clear. You see, don't you dare flagulate. You can say this is the world of flesh, your own heart, the devil, whatever.

Don't you dare flagulate me and I'm not going to flagulate myself because he is risen and that's my receipt. That means everything's been paid in full. So don't let your sins and your flaws get you down.

Don't let them move you. Don't let them throw you. See, let nothing move you.

Don't let them move you. Secondly, don't let ambiguity of life move you. Now I know this is going to sound weird, I'll be brief.

Christians, if you understand the doctrine of the resurrection and the doctrine of the resurrection is the first fruits, but only the first fruits. In other words, the future of God has landed, which means incredible powers available to see all sorts of things change, but it's only the beginning. It's only the first fruits.

God hasn't come in his fullness. There's still tons and tons of brokenness. There's still tons and tons of death.

There's all kinds of problems. Now what does that mean? Well, people get into the life and first of all, see all kinds of disappointments and all kinds of tragedies and they'll harden their hearts.

They'll say, look at how bad life is. So you give up hope, you get cynical, you say, well, what can you expect? You harden yourself because you don't want to be disappointed.

But Christians won't do that. Christians stay impatient with the world. They stay impatient with themselves because they have hope.

If you have hope, you're impatient. If you say to other your friends, you could be better than this. If you say to yourself, you could be better than this.

If you say to New York City, you could be so much better than this. You're not a cynic. You're impatient because you're filled with hope.

But Christians also are against padd answers. Christians also realize there's all sorts of brokenness here. Christians should not be naive, bright eyed, bushy, tailed people and they shouldn't be cynical.

People, they shouldn't be walk around saying everything's a blessing and there's going to be revival. If you just believe in Jesus Christ, your whole life will come together. That's not what that's not the doctrine of the resurrection.

We only have the first fruits. That's it. There's all sorts of brokenness here.

Christians have the theology to understand the ambiguity of life in a way that nobody else does and therefore we should have high tolerance for ambiguity, not ambiguity of belief, but the ambiguity of the circumstances of life. Neither cynical nor naive, you see. Happily ironic.

You see, joyfully humble, bold and absolutely ready to have God say, no. Are you ready for that? You know, an awful lot of people go from the cynicism, from the naivete to the cynicism and it happens in Christianity.

People who are Christians are very, very naive and everything's going to be fine. And then we find that things aren't fine and then they get really, really cynical because you aren't listening to the sermon. Thirdly, and lastly, don't let your sins throw you.

Don't let the ambiguities of life throw you, but lastly, don't let death throw you. It's a historic fact that when the epidemics swept through the Roman cities, in the first, second and third centuries BC, the AD, the Roman cities, the plagues came through and the pagans though they didn't believe in, they didn't have germ theory, they knew that if you kept contact with someone who was sick, you were going to die too. And the plagues were probably smallpox and they were terrible.

25 to 33% of all the people in the major Roman cities died during the epidemics. And we're told that what pagans did was those who had the means got out of the city and it was very, very normal when a member of your own family got sick to even before he or she was dead throw them in the street. But Christians did not leave.

Christians picked up not only their own sick and stayed in the city and cared for them, they picked up the pagan sick, touching them, lifting them up, their sores oozing onto their hands, knowing that this probably meant they might die, but they stayed. Now why did, and historians will show you that the Christianity Christians, because they stayed, because they weren't afraid, because they cared for the sick and the dying and the poor, not only their own, but also of pagans, it had an enormous impact on the people. It had an enormous impact on society, it made Christians incredibly credible, but here's the question, why did they stay?

And the pagans left. Well, you say, well, I guess Christians were better people. No, they believed in the resurrection.

It had pierced their heart like a shaft. And they looked around, they said, everything was, there was oppression, and there was, there was disease, and there was death, and they said, what? The shadow was a passing thing.

Compared to light and high beauty, and because the resurrection happened, we know it's there, therefore, what if I die? Come on, death, give me your best shot. Do your worst.

The lower you lay me, the higher you'll raise me, the worse that you can do is the best is just make me better. As George Herbert said, death used to be an executioner, but the gospel made him just a gardener. And the other reason that they picked up the bodies was because the resurrection doesn't just make you unafraid of death and willing to handle suffering.

But the resurrection also means the body matters. The body matters. Jesus Christ came from heaven to earth, not to deliver us from the body, but to mend the body.

Jesus Christ took a body, and he raised the body, he didn't discard the body. In other words, in other words, not just the soul, but the body is the object of God's redemptive purposes. And if Jesus Christ would go to all this suffering and come all the way to not just redeem your soul, but your body, then Christians see people who are hungry, people who are poor, people who are disease.

This is the reason why we take the Easter sacrificial offering for the needs of the poor and the needs of the city, because the resurrection means God does not just want your soul save, but he wants your body mended. And Christians are out there not just to save people's souls, but to bring healing to every aspect of life, to deal with every aspect of sin. Listen, let nothing move you.

Therefore, do you understand this? To the degree you do, nothing will move you. Let's pray.

Father, we ask that you would make us these strong, immutable people, because of the hope that has pierced our heart like a shaft. Not just defiance, not just keeping us to the upper lip, not just stoicism, but truth hitting our heart and overwhelming us with the glory of it, till we become people like those folks who change the old Roman world we could do it now. Make us people of the resurrection in Jesus' name we pray.

Amen. Thanks for listening to today's teaching. It's our prayer that you were encouraged by it and that it helps you apply the gospel to your life.

现在，请听蒂姆·凯勒继续今天的教导。复活已经将未来带到了现在。复活已经使你们得到了称义。那么，什么超越了永远的定罪和审判？

又有什么开始了呢？是国度。正如第20至24节所说。那么，第一果是什么？

是国度。首先，也是最后，完整的国度。这就是15章20到24节的意思。现在让我们进入最后一个要点，因为保罗基本上是在说这一切只是为了达到这个结论。

当到达这个结论时，他说：“好吧，这在我们的生活中有什么不同吗？”我特别喜欢第58或59节中的一句话：“所以，亲爱的弟兄们，请站立坚定，不要让任何东西动摇你们。” 总是全心全意地献身于主的工作。那么，“因此”后面指的是什么呢？

让我花一分钟时间。你如何应对困难？你是如何变得坚强的？你如何面对生活中的困难？

你是如何成为不动摇的人？这就是保罗在谈论的问题。你怎么做到这一点？你怎么应对生活的困难？

你知道，只是咬紧牙关说：“我要坚强。” 你说：“我是基督徒，这不会影响我。” 这不是保罗的做法。保罗不建议你咬紧牙关，让任何东西动摇不了你。

“因此”后面指的是什么呢？这里的“因此”涵盖了哥林多前书15章的全部神学内容。你看，当保罗说他希望你们成为坚强的人时，并不只是要与世界抗争。他说的是思考，是思考上帝所做的一切如何使你感到敬畏和荣耀。

这非常全面。让心灵参与进来，直到情感激荡到极致，意志变得无比强大。所以当保罗说“因此”这个词时，他指的是前面所有的一 Corinthians 的内容，而他真正要做的，是我们大多数人在面对困境时所做的事情恰恰相反。我们只是硬抗。

这是纯粹的斯多葛主义。我们直接与意志对抗，而不是像保罗那样。保罗说：“你们需要有盼望。” 希望只来自于一个理解：这个复活确实发生了，它做了什么。

我的英雄之一是《魔戒》中的山姆·甘吉。在书中有一个地方，他几乎到了绝望的地步。他抬头望向星空，看到了一些东西。他说：“他从藏身之处爬出来，向外望去，只见土地满是吱吱嘎嘎、窸窸窣窣的声音。

” 他陷入了绝境。你不需要知道具体情况。但他看到，“云层之上，黑暗的山峰中，有星星在闪烁。” 山姆被那光芒刺痛了心扉。

当他从这片荒芜之地抬头望向天空时，希望重新回到了他的心中，就像一道清澈冰冷的思想穿透了他的心灵：“最终，阴影只是一场短暂而微不足道的事。” 光明和高远的美丽永远超越它的触及范围。那时，他不再只是为自己抗争，而是将自己置于一个更深、更无波澜的睡眠中。现在其中有很多微妙之处。

你看，在过去，山姆变强大是因为他只是硬抗。他直接锻炼自己的意志力。但最终，你注意到它说这是自我中心的。“自我中心”就是说：“我不用担心，我不会出汗，我会没事的，我会坚强。

” 但是突然间，他得到了希望。什么是希望？是一种刺痛心灵的思想。就像一道清澈冰冷的思想穿透了他的心扉：“最终，阴影只是一场短暂而微不足道的事；光明和高远的美丽永远超越它的触及范围。

” 现在这不过是黑暗中的呼喊，除非耶稣基督真的复活了。如果祂真的复活了，那么我建议你像萨姆看着那颗星星一样去看它，直到箭头穿透你的心，然后你就站定了，没有什么能动摇你。让我快速给你列举一些不会让你困扰的事情。首先，你的罪和瑕疵不再会困扰你。

你们相信耶稣的复活吗？你看？如果耶稣不在了，那么上帝看你时就会满意，并接受你，你的罪和瑕疵就不会再困扰你。你会问，这怎么可能呢？

想象一下你在梅西百货购物的情景。梅西百货是个非常大的商店，假设你买了一件很大的东西，太大而无法装进袋子里。你需要从你现在的位置走到街上。当你到达街上时，一切都会好起来的。

但路上有人会说，他们会要求你的收据。为什么呢？因为如果保安拦住你或销售人员或其他人问你拿着那个东西做什么，你可以挥舞着你的收据说：“不要打扰我。” 我已经付了款，一分钱也没欠。

什么都没有欠。我是清白的。复活节是什么？这就是你的收据。

因为你将要面对问题，很多问题。你会从这个世界得到问题，从肉体得到问题，还会从魔鬼那里得到问题。这些问题会这样问你：如果你知道你在西边五点钟礼拜时心里想的是些什么。我注意到那边有一个很吸引人的家伙，就开始胡思乱想，哇，我简直不敢相信自己在教堂里。

天哪。你自己的心也会说：“上帝为什么爱你？”“上帝为什么要爱你？”当你心中开始下沉时，你可以拿出你的收据——耶稣基督的复活。

不要打扰我。不要打扰我。我已经付了款。我是清白的。

你看，你可别自欺。无论这是世界、肉体还是魔鬼的问题，你都可以这样说。不要你欺骗我，我也不会欺骗自己，因为复活了，这就是我的收据。**这意味着一切已经全部付清。**

所以不要让你的罪和缺陷使你沮丧。不要让他们动摇你。不要让他们打倒你。你看，什么也不要动摇你。

不要让他们动摇你。其次，不要让生活的不确定性动摇你。现在我知道这听起来很奇怪，我很快说清楚。基督徒们，如果你理解复活的教义，复活是初熟的果子，但只是初熟的果子。

换句话说，神未来的希望已经降临，**这意味着有各种不可思议的力量可以改变许多事情，但这只是一个开始。**这只是初熟的果子。神还没有完全到来。仍然有很多很多的破碎和死亡。

还有很多问题。那意味着什么呢？嗯，人们进入生活后，首先会遇到各种失望和悲剧，他们的心就会变硬。他们会说：“看这生活有多糟糕。

”于是你就放弃了希望，变得愤世嫉俗，说：“那又能怎样？”你心生冷漠，因为你不想再受挫。但是基督徒不会这样做。基督徒对世界保持不耐烦的态度，对自己也保持不耐烦的态度，因为他们有希望。

如果你有希望，你会不耐烦。如果你对朋友说：“你可以做得更好。”或者对自己说：“你可以做得更好。”或者对纽约市说：“你可以变得更好。

” 你不是愤世嫉俗的人。你是不耐烦的，因为你充满了希望。但是基督徒也不应该寻求简单的答案。基督徒也意识到这里有很多破碎和缺陷。

基督徒不应该天真无邪、充满活力地生活，也不应该愤世嫉俗。人们不应该到处说一切都是祝福，并且会有复兴。如果你只是相信耶稣基督，你的一生就会变得完整。这并不是复活的教义。

我们只有初熟的果子。就是这样。这里还有很多很多的破碎和缺陷。基督徒有神学来理解生活中的模糊性，这是其他人无法比拟的。

因此，我们应该对生活的模糊性抱有很高的宽容度，不是信仰上的模糊，而是生活中状况的模糊。既不愤世嫉俗，也不幼稚天真。满怀幽默感。你明白吗？

满怀谦卑的喜悦，勇敢无畏，并且绝对准备好上帝说“不”。你准备好了吗？你知道很多人从天真无知走向愤世嫉俗，在基督教中也是如此。基督徒非常天真，认为一切都会好起来。

但当发现事情并非如此时，他们变得极其愤世嫉俗，这是因为没有听懂布道。最后一点，不要让罪行困扰你。不要让生活中的模糊性困扰你，更不要让死亡困扰你。一个历史事实是，在公元前1世纪到公元3世纪之间，瘟疫席卷了罗马城市。

当时异教徒虽然不相信病菌理论，但他们知道接触生病的人会导致自己也染病。这些瘟疫很可能是天花，非常可怕。在瘟疫期间，主要罗马城市的25%至33%人口死亡。我们被告知，异教徒的做法是那些有能力的人都离开了城市，而在家人患病之前甚至死后将其扔到街上，这是非常常见的现象。

但基督徒没有离开。基督徒不仅照顾自己生病的人，留在城里护理他们，还照顾异教徒的病人，接触他们、扶持他们，知道这可能意味着他们会死去，但他们依然留下了。现在为什么是这样？历史学家会告诉你，因为基督徒不害怕，因为他们关心病患和死者，不仅是自己的，也包括异教徒的，这对人们产生了巨大的影响。

它对社会产生了巨大影响，使基督徒变得极其可信，但问题是，他们为什么要留下？而异教徒却离开了。你说，那大概是因为基督徒是更好的人吧？不是的，因为他们相信复活。

信仰的箭矢穿透了他们的心灵。他们环顾四周，看到的是压迫、疾病和死亡，他们说：“什么？影子只是暂时的。” 与光明和高雅之美相比，影子不过是过客。

因为复活发生了，我们知道它就在那里，因此，如果我死了呢？来吧，死神，拿出你的最好招数。尽你所能。你越是压低我，我就越能被提升；你越是折磨我，就越能让我变得更好。

正如乔治·赫伯特所说，死亡曾是刽子手，但福音使他变成了园丁。另一个他们收殓尸体的原因是，复活不仅让你不再害怕死亡和愿意面对苦难。复活还意味着身体很重要。身体很重要。

耶稣基督从天上来到地上，并不是要将我们从身体中解脱出来，而是为了修复身体。耶稣基督取了肉身，又复活了肉身，并没有抛弃肉身。换句话说，不仅是灵魂，连同身体也是神救赎的目的之一。如果耶稣基督愿意承受这一切苦难，不仅为赎回你的灵魂而来，也为赎回你的身体而来，那么基督徒就会看到那些饥饿的人、贫穷的人和患病的人。

这是为什么我们为穷人和城市的需求奉献复活节祭物的原因，因为复活意味着上帝不仅希望你的灵魂得救，还希望你的身体得以医治。基督徒不只是要拯救人的灵魂，还要带来生命各个方面的医治，处理罪的每一个方面。听好了，没有什么能够动摇你。因此，你们明白这一点了吗？

理解到这个程度，就不会被任何东西动摇了。我们来祷告吧。父啊，求你使我们成为这些坚定不移的人，因为希望已经像箭一样穿透我们的心。不只是反抗，不只是保持表面的坚定，不只是坚韧不拔，而是真理击中我们的心，并以它的荣耀让我们无法抗拒，直到我们成为那些能改变旧罗马世界的人。

愿我们在耶稣的名里成为复活之人。阿门。感谢你们今天聆听我们的教导。愿它鼓励了你们，并帮助你们在生活中应用福音。
