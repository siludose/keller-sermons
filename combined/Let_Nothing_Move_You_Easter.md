Turn in the bullet into the passage of Scripture on which the teaching is based. First Corinthians 15. Now, there's three basic things that Paul says about the resurrection.

Now, the musicians know what they are, don't you? The musicians have heard this three times. And they are so holy that tonight, when they turn off the lights, they're going to glow in the dark.

But you don't know what those three things are yet. And so, just to get a little bit of the effulgence of the musicians to get your cut, let's read. First Corinthians 15.

For what I received, I passed on to you as of first importance, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He appeared to Peter, and then to the twelve. And after that, He appeared to more than 500 of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead.

And the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep, for since death, came through a man. The resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.

But each in his own turn, Christ the first fruits, then when He comes those who belong to Him, then the end will come when He hands over the kingdom to God the Father after He has destroyed all dominion, authority and power, for He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death. Listen, I tell you a mystery.

We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed in a flash. In the twinkle of an eye, at the last trumpet, for the trumpet will sound. The dead will be raised in perishable, and we will be changed.

For the perishable must close itself with imperishable, and the mortal with immortality. And when the perishable has been clothed within the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true. Death is swallowed up in victory.

Where O death is your victory, where O death is your sting. The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law, but thanks be to God. He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

Therefore my dear brothers stand firm, but nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain. Now, what Paul does here is he answers three questions, and it's a long chapter, and I've only pulled a couple of pieces out, and you could do worse than to read the whole chapter on Easter Sunday.

First Corinthians 15, maybe the great chapter in the whole Bible on the meaning of the resurrection of Jesus. And he answers three questions about Jesus' resurrection. Did he do it?

What did it do? And what should we do about it? See, did it happen, in other words, what did it accomplish, and what should we do about it?

Now, those three things hang together, though I'd like to concentrate tonight on the last point. But see, here's how they hang together. First of all, Paul, in the first few verses, tries to explain that if you're going to get the benefits of the resurrection in your life, if it's really going to make a difference in your life, if it's really going to change you, you have to believe it actually happened.

That's the reason he goes to the trouble in the very beginning of saying, look, I received. Now, these are technical Greek verbs, actually. He chooses verbs when he says, I received, and I passed on to you.

These are verbs that mean I researched, I got information, and I passed it on. I talked to the eyewitnesses. I talked to 500.

He says, 500 Christians who are still alive when I'm writing this, which is 20 years after Jesus' death and resurrection, who are still there, you can still go and ask them. See, when Paul makes this sort of public claim in a publicly circulated letter, when he says, look, there are 500 witnesses, go and talk to them if you want. They all saw Jesus at once after he had been raised from the dead.

What is Paul doing? He was saying, it matters. It matters whether you believe it really happened.

The average person in New York City believes the resurrection is a wonderful concept. It's a symbol. It's a symbol of good triumphing over bad.

It's a symbol that you can have a new start after a disaster. If you want a little example of it, of that view of the resurrection, it's the New York Times lead editorial today. It says, well, Christians have always celebrated the fact that here was a man who stood against tyranny.

Since Christians are not supposed to be sensitive, that would be an insult and therefore it's not. But if we were sensitive, it would be an insult. Paul goes to great pains and says, if you have a comfortable little life, the symbol of the resurrection, meaning just how good things overcome bad things eventually, might be a some comfort.

In your life with concrete trouble, concrete trials, concrete, real death coming at you, unless you believe in a concrete, real physical, literal, historical resurrection, you're not going to be any different. You're not going to be able to handle real trouble unless you believe in a real resurrection. You can't believe the resurrection is just a beautiful symbol but didn't happen literally or physically.

Paul goes out of his way to say, like in verse 20, but Christ has risen indeed. That's why we say, not just he's risen, indeed he's risen, really risen, actually risen. His body rekindled and he walked out.

And Paul's here saying, the reason he lays all these verses down in the very beginning is, he says unless you believe it, it's not going to change you. That's the first point. Now, the second point is not only does he say, you have to believe it happen, but he also says, you have to believe or have to understand what it accomplished.

The resurrection isn't just something that happened. It's not just a naked display of power, it accomplishes something. And what is it accomplish?

Well, there's two things that Paul says happen, the resurrection accomplishes. The first one, he says in verse 17, which I didn't print there unfortunately, where Paul says, if Christ has not raised from the dead, you're still in your sins. In fact, he says it in a very vivid way.

He says, if Christ is still in the ground, you are still in your sins. Why would that be? Because the resurrection proves that something is over.

What's over? It says in Romans 4.25, Jesus was put to death for our sins, but he was raised for our justification. What's that mean?

It means this. When you see death, when you get near death, when you go to a funeral with somebody you know, no matter who they are. In spite of the fact that this society will tell you death is natural, it's a normal part of living, you know it's not.

Death is unnatural, death isn't right. We don't want to die, we don't want to say our loved ones die. There's something abnormal about it.

Death forbids us to rise, but we want to rise, but it forbids us to rise. Death pulls us down. Death isn't right.

That's the reason why that famous line of Dylan Thomas is so famous. Dylan Thomas says, we rage against the dying of the light. We rage, we know death isn't natural, but if it's not natural, then it's been inflicted.

So you know that death is a natural, but if death is a natural, then it's a judgment, then it's a punishment. And why? Well, the Bible answers that.

We have been put into a world that's built. It's built to work if we live not for ourselves, but for others and for God. We're built to serve other people and to preserve God.

That's not how we live. We live to serve ourselves and use other people in God to reach our needs and to get to our goals. And as a result, the world doesn't work.

And we don't work in death is a natural consequence. We're going against the warp and woof and fabric of a reality and the wages of that is disintegration. And disintegration is death.

And therefore, death has authority. Death is a judgment. When Jesus Christ died, Paul says, if he didn't rise, you're still in your sins.

Why? Here's why. If Jesus Christ had died, death would still be owed.

Death would still have authority. But when Jesus Christ rose, we already sang about it. Death in vain forbids him rise.

The last hymn, too, is great. It talks about death in vain. Death can't.

Why? Because justice has been paid. Judgment has been paid.

Jesus Christ, when he died, rendered everything necessary. And therefore, death in vain. Death has no power.

Death has no authority over us. And therefore, condemnation is done. See?

The resurrection means condemnation is over. The resurrection means that your sins have been paid for. God has satisfied you.

Actually, if you go to the Old Testament on one day of the year, all the people gathered, and the high priest came on Yom Kippur, and what do the high priest do? He went into the veil. What was behind the veil?

The Holy of Holies. Where was he going? He was going to a tone for the sins of the people.

And everybody was nervous. Why? Because he was going back before the raw presence of God.

Would the sacrifice be acceptable? Somebody waited with Bated Breath, and he went down. He almost went to a certain death.

He went into the veil. But after he had made the sacrifice every year, he came out. He came through.

And everybody rejoiced why? Because it meant that there's sins have been a tone for. But that was happening every year, over and over again, as the book of Hebrews says, in a way that can ever completely satisfy the conscience.

But when Jesus Christ went into the earth and came out, that was God's way of saying to everybody, your sins have been paid in full. And that's the reason why, on the one hand, without the resurrection, you have absolutely no confidence that God looks at you right now and is satisfied and accepts you. But on the other hand, the resurrection does not just prove that something is over.

It proves that something has begun. It goes in verse 20 to 23. Twice.

We're told Jesus Christ is the first fruits. Now what's the first fruits? Wow.

Here's what the first fruits mean. There is a world. There is an eternal world.

A world of complete justice. A world of complete love. A world where nothing gets old and dies into case.

World of life and truth and beauty. But it's the ideal world. And this is the real world.

And everybody knows that there's a concrete slab between the real world and the ideal world. But when Jesus rose from the dead, this was not just fireworks. This was not just a naked display of power.

This was the ideal breaking into the real Jesus Christ is the first fruits. What are the first fruits? It's the first thing out of the garden.

It's the first thing out of the grain. It's the first fruit of the vine. It's what's about to come.

It's the reality. It's really part of the harvest, even though it's not in there in fullness. And what it means is the future of God has landed.

In the resurrection, a hole was punched in the pitiless walls of the world. And into a world of decay has come immortality. Into a world of darkness has come light.

And when Jesus Christ says, believe in me and you'll receive the resurrection into your life. This is not just, you're going to get inspired. You're going to get a little happy.

You know, he's going to kind of give you strength to go through the day. Lift up your eyes. Give up your small ambitions.

The Bible says that Christians and the church is God's eschatological beechhead. That means the future eschatology, eschatological means his future has come in now. Partial but real.

First fruits, but only first. But really fruits, but only the first. But into the world now, when you become a Christian into your heart comes the fruit of the spirit.

And your life comes the gifts of the spirit. And your heart comes real, divine, future joy and love and glory. And when you have the gifts of the spirit, it means that when you care for other people, when you counsel other people, when you witness other people, when you teach other people, you're bringing the life of the future into their lives.

And the alienations of this world. The alienation where we're spiritually alienated from God, and we're psychologically alienated from our true selves, we're socially alienated from other races and classes and nationalities. Those things begin to get healed through the gifts of the spirit which are given to you because the future has come.

Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer? Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith? For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding of what it means to follow Christ.

A great resource to start using this summer is the new city catechism devotional. God's truth for our hearts and minds. This devotional brings the historic catechisms of the Christian Church to life, offering a question to consider for each week of the year.

In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catechesis, the rich and communal practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers that frame the foundational beliefs of the Christian faith. Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer, and a brief meditation that will challenge and inspire you. The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller, and Kevin De Young, as well as historical figures such as Augustine, John Calvin, and Martin Luther.

This month, in addition to the new city catechism devotional, we are including a great companion resource, the new city catechism for kids, as our thank you for your gift to help gospel and life share the hope of Christ's love with people all over the world. So, request your copies today at gospelonlife.com slash give. That's gospelonlife.com slash give.

Now, here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. The resurrection has brought the future into the present. The resurrection has brought you your justification.

So, what's over the condemnation and judgment forever? And what's begun? The kingdom.

That's right there in verses 20 to 24. The first fruits of what? The kingdom.

First, then, and finally, the full kingdom. That's what 20 to 24 says. Now, let's get to the last point because Paul is basically saying all of this to get to the end.

When you get to the end, he's saying, all right, what difference does this make in the way we live? And I love the word there in verse 58 or 59 where he says, therefore, my dear brothers, stand firm. Let nothing move you.

Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord. Therefore, what's there for? What's there for referring to?

Let me take a minute here. How do you deal with trouble? How do you become strong?

How do you face the troubles of life? How do you become immovable? How do you become someone who stands firm?

That's what Paul's talking about. How do you do it? How do you deal with the troubles of life?

You know, you just stiffen your upper lip. You say, I'm going to be tough. You just say, I'm a Christian.

I'm not going to let this get to me. That's not what Paul does. Paul doesn't say, you know, stiffen your upper lip and let nothing move you.

What is it, therefore, referring to? Therefore is all the theology of 1 Corinthians 15. See, when Paul says, I want you to become somebody who's strong.

He doesn't say just to fight the world. He says, think. He says, think to the glory of what God has done overwhelms you.

It's very holistic. Get your mind engaged until your heart gets so-or-flowing that your will becomes absolutely overwhelmingly strong. So when Paul said a little word, therefore, is referring back to all the 1 Corinthians and what he's really doing, the way most of us deal with trouble is we just defy.

It's just totally stoic. We work right with the will, not Paul. Paul says, you need hope.

And hope only comes from an understanding that this resurrection really happened and what it did. You know, one of my heroes is Sam, Gamgee and Lord of the Rings. And there's one place where he's just about at the end of his rope.

And he looks up into the stars and he sees something. It says, he crawled from the hiding place and he looked out. The land seemed full of creaking and cracking and sly noises.

He was in a terrible spot. It was, you don't need to know. But he says, they're peeping up among the cloud rack far above a dark tower in the mountains.

Sam saw a white star twinkle. The beauty of it smote his heart. As he looked up out of the forsaken land and hope returned to him, for like a shaft clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the end the shadow was only a small and passing thing.

There was light and high beauty forever beyond its reach. His song and the tower had been defiance rather than hope for then he was thinking of himself. Now for a moment, his own fate ceased to trouble him.

He crawled back into the brambles, laid himself down and putting away all fear. He cast himself into a deep untroubled sleep. Now there's a lot of nuances in there.

See, in the past, the way Sam had gotten strong was he was just defying. He worked directly on his will. But in the end, you notice it said, it said it was self-absorbed.

To be self-absorbed to say, I'm not going to sweat, I'm not going to sweat, I'm going to be okay, I'm going to be strong. But suddenly here, he got hope. What is hope?

A thought that pierced his heart. See, like a shaft clear and cold, the thought pierced his heart. That in the end the shadow was a small and passing thing and there was light and high beauty forever beyond its reach.

Now that is nothing but whistling in the dark unless the resurrection of Jesus Christ happened. And if it happened, then I suggest you look at it, like Sam looked at that star until the shaft pierces your heart and then you will be immovable. Nothing will bother you.

Let me just give you quickly some things that won't bother you that are mentioned here. First of all, your sins and flaws won't bother you. Do you believe in the resurrection?

You see? If Jesus is out, then God looks at you and is satisfied and accepts you and your sins and flaws won't bother you. You say, how does that work?

Imagine you're buying something in Macy's. Macy's a very, very big store and let's just say you bought something huge, some big object that you can't put in a bag. And you have to walk from where you are out to the street.

Now when you get to the street, you'll be all right. But on the way out, you know what they'll say? They'll take a receipt.

Why? Well, if a security man stops you or if a salesperson or somebody stops you and says, what are you doing with that? What you can do is you can wave your receipt and you can say, trouble me not.

I have paid for this. I don't owe a penny. I owe nothing.

I'm free and clear. What is the resurrection? It's your receipt.

Because you see, you're going to get questions. You're going to get lots of questions. You're going to get questions from the world.

You're going to get questions from the flesh and you're going to get questions from the devil. And the questions will come like this. It'll say, if anybody knew the kind of thoughts that go through your heart during the west side five o'clock service.

I notice somebody who's pretty attractive over there and I start to think about things and, wow, I can't believe it. Here I am in church. Oh my gosh.

Your own heart's going to come and say, what makes you think God loves you? Why would God love you? And as your heart starts to sink, you pull out your receipt, which is the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Trouble me not. Trouble me not. I'm paid for.

I'm free and clear. You see, don't you dare flagulate. You can say this is the world of flesh, your own heart, the devil, whatever.

Don't you dare flagulate me and I'm not going to flagulate myself because he is risen and that's my receipt. That means everything's been paid in full. So don't let your sins and your flaws get you down.

Don't let them move you. Don't let them throw you. See, let nothing move you.

Don't let them move you. Secondly, don't let ambiguity of life move you. Now I know this is going to sound weird, I'll be brief.

Christians, if you understand the doctrine of the resurrection and the doctrine of the resurrection is the first fruits, but only the first fruits. In other words, the future of God has landed, which means incredible powers available to see all sorts of things change, but it's only the beginning. It's only the first fruits.

God hasn't come in his fullness. There's still tons and tons of brokenness. There's still tons and tons of death.

There's all kinds of problems. Now what does that mean? Well, people get into the life and first of all, see all kinds of disappointments and all kinds of tragedies and they'll harden their hearts.

They'll say, look at how bad life is. So you give up hope, you get cynical, you say, well, what can you expect? You harden yourself because you don't want to be disappointed.

But Christians won't do that. Christians stay impatient with the world. They stay impatient with themselves because they have hope.

If you have hope, you're impatient. If you say to other your friends, you could be better than this. If you say to yourself, you could be better than this.

If you say to New York City, you could be so much better than this. You're not a cynic. You're impatient because you're filled with hope.

But Christians also are against padd answers. Christians also realize there's all sorts of brokenness here. Christians should not be naive, bright eyed, bushy, tailed people and they shouldn't be cynical.

People, they shouldn't be walk around saying everything's a blessing and there's going to be revival. If you just believe in Jesus Christ, your whole life will come together. That's not what that's not the doctrine of the resurrection.

We only have the first fruits. That's it. There's all sorts of brokenness here.

Christians have the theology to understand the ambiguity of life in a way that nobody else does and therefore we should have high tolerance for ambiguity, not ambiguity of belief, but the ambiguity of the circumstances of life. Neither cynical nor naive, you see. Happily ironic.

You see, joyfully humble, bold and absolutely ready to have God say, no. Are you ready for that? You know, an awful lot of people go from the cynicism, from the naivete to the cynicism and it happens in Christianity.

People who are Christians are very, very naive and everything's going to be fine. And then we find that things aren't fine and then they get really, really cynical because you aren't listening to the sermon. Thirdly, and lastly, don't let your sins throw you.

Don't let the ambiguities of life throw you, but lastly, don't let death throw you. It's a historic fact that when the epidemics swept through the Roman cities, in the first, second and third centuries BC, the AD, the Roman cities, the plagues came through and the pagans though they didn't believe in, they didn't have germ theory, they knew that if you kept contact with someone who was sick, you were going to die too. And the plagues were probably smallpox and they were terrible.

25 to 33% of all the people in the major Roman cities died during the epidemics. And we're told that what pagans did was those who had the means got out of the city and it was very, very normal when a member of your own family got sick to even before he or she was dead throw them in the street. But Christians did not leave.

Christians picked up not only their own sick and stayed in the city and cared for them, they picked up the pagan sick, touching them, lifting them up, their sores oozing onto their hands, knowing that this probably meant they might die, but they stayed. Now why did, and historians will show you that the Christianity Christians, because they stayed, because they weren't afraid, because they cared for the sick and the dying and the poor, not only their own, but also of pagans, it had an enormous impact on the people. It had an enormous impact on society, it made Christians incredibly credible, but here's the question, why did they stay?

And the pagans left. Well, you say, well, I guess Christians were better people. No, they believed in the resurrection.

It had pierced their heart like a shaft. And they looked around, they said, everything was, there was oppression, and there was, there was disease, and there was death, and they said, what? The shadow was a passing thing.

Compared to light and high beauty, and because the resurrection happened, we know it's there, therefore, what if I die? Come on, death, give me your best shot. Do your worst.

The lower you lay me, the higher you'll raise me, the worse that you can do is the best is just make me better. As George Herbert said, death used to be an executioner, but the gospel made him just a gardener. And the other reason that they picked up the bodies was because the resurrection doesn't just make you unafraid of death and willing to handle suffering.

But the resurrection also means the body matters. The body matters. Jesus Christ came from heaven to earth, not to deliver us from the body, but to mend the body.

Jesus Christ took a body, and he raised the body, he didn't discard the body. In other words, in other words, not just the soul, but the body is the object of God's redemptive purposes. And if Jesus Christ would go to all this suffering and come all the way to not just redeem your soul, but your body, then Christians see people who are hungry, people who are poor, people who are disease.

This is the reason why we take the Easter sacrificial offering for the needs of the poor and the needs of the city, because the resurrection means God does not just want your soul save, but he wants your body mended. And Christians are out there not just to save people's souls, but to bring healing to every aspect of life, to deal with every aspect of sin. Listen, let nothing move you.

Therefore, do you understand this? To the degree you do, nothing will move you. Let's pray.

Father, we ask that you would make us these strong, immutable people, because of the hope that has pierced our heart like a shaft. Not just defiance, not just keeping us to the upper lip, not just stoicism, but truth hitting our heart and overwhelming us with the glory of it, till we become people like those folks who change the old Roman world we could do it now. Make us people of the resurrection in Jesus' name we pray.

Amen. Thanks for listening to today's teaching. It's our prayer that you were encouraged by it and that it helps you apply the gospel to your life.

欢迎来到《福音与生命》播客。你相信基督的复活只是一个象征，还是一件真实的历史事件？今天，提摩太·凯勒将教导我们为什么相信复活的真实历史性是它真正改变你的唯一途径。听完今天的讲道后，请访问 gospelandlife.com 并订阅电子邮件更新。

现在，保罗说了三件关于复活的基本事情。音乐家们都知道是什么，不是吗？音乐家们已经听过三次了，而且今晚当他们关灯时，他们会发出光芒。但你还不知道那三件事是什么。

所以，为了让你也分享一些音乐家的光辉，请让我们一起读第一 Corinthians 15。因为，我所领受、又传给你们的，第一要紧的，就是基督照圣经所说，为我们的罪死了，而且埋葬了，又照圣经所说，第三天复活了，并且显给矶法看，然后显给十二使徒看。后来，同时显给五百多个弟兄看，其中大部分还活着，不过有些人已经睡了。但基督确实从死里复活了。

并且是那些睡了的人的初熟果子；因为自从亚当进来的死，是因一人；将来藉着人也要来的救恩，也是为众人而来的。就如在亚当里众人都死了，在基督里众人也都要复活。但各人按着自己的次序：基督是头一个复活的，然后，当祂再来的时候，那些属于祂的人也要复活。然后，当祂将一切执政的、掌权的、有能的，都毁灭了以后，就把国交与父神；因为基督必要作王，直到将一切仇敌都放在祂的脚下。

末后的仇敌死亡也必被除灭。听我说一个奥秘。我们将不会全都沉睡，而是都要改变。在一瞬间，当号角吹响时，我们都会改变。

因为号角将要响起。那必朽坏的要穿上不朽坏的，那必死的要穿上不死的。那时，经上所记的话就应验了：“死亡啊，你的胜利在哪里？你的毒钩在哪里？

” 死亡的毒钩就是罪，罪的权势乃是律法。但感谢神！藉着我们的主耶稣基督，我们已经得胜有余了。所以亲爱的弟兄们，请你们坚固，不可摇动。

常要在主里立志行事，因为知道你们在主里面劳苦不是徒然的。现在保罗在这里回答了三个问题，这一章很长，我只摘录了几部分内容，你可以在复活节那天读整章经文。哥林多前书第十五章可能是整本圣经中关于耶稣复活意义最伟大的一章。他回答了关于耶稣复活的三个问题：他是否真的做了这件事？

它做了什么？我们应该如何回应？这三个问题是相互关联的，虽然今晚我想重点讨论最后一点。但请注意，它们是如何联系在一起的。

首先，保罗在前几节中试图解释说，如果你要从复活中获得益处，如果它真的能在你的生命中产生影响，如果它真的能改变你，你就必须相信这件事确实发生了。这就是他一开始费心说明的原因：“我从前领受又传给你们。” 这些是技术性的希腊动词。他说“我领受”、“我传递”，这些词的意思是他研究了信息，并将其传达给别人。

他与目击者交谈过，与五百人说过话。他说：“500个在写这封信时还活着的基督徒，也就是耶稣死后复活20年后的今天，你们还可以去问他们。当保罗在一封公开流传的信中这样做出公开声明时，他说道：‘看，有500位目击者，如果你想的话，可以去找他们谈谈。’他们都亲眼见过复活后的耶稣。

” 保罗在做什么？他在说：“这很重要。你是否相信这一切真的发生过，这很重要。” 纽约市的普通市民认为复活是一个美好的概念，一个象征。

它象征着善战胜恶。它象征着在灾难之后你可以拥有新的开始。如果你想要一个复活观念的小例子，那就是今天的《纽约时报》头版社论。它说：“基督教徒一直庆祝这样一个事实：有一个男人敢于对抗暴政。

” 既然基督徒不应该敏感，那这就会被视为一种侮辱，所以不会这么说。但如果我们敏感的话，这就是一种侮辱。保罗特意强调过，如果你过着安逸的生活，认为复活只是一个象征性的概念，意味着善最终会战胜恶，可能会给你一些安慰。但在你面对具体的困难、实际的考验和真实的死亡威胁时，除非你相信一个具体的真实的历史性复活，否则你是无法应对真正的麻烦的。

你不能只相信复活是一个美丽的象征而没有真正发生过。保罗特意在第20节中说：“然而，基督的确已经复活了。”这就是为什么我们说：“他不仅复活了，确实复活了，真的复活了。”他的身体被重新点燃，然后走了出来。

保罗在这里说，他把这些经文放在开头的原因是，他说除非你相信它，否则不会改变你。这是第一个要点。现在第二个要点是，他不仅说你需要相信这件事发生了，还说你需要相信或理解它所完成的事情。复活不只是发生了一件事，而是一个纯粹展示力量的行为。

它完成了某些事情。那么，它完成了什么呢？保罗提到了两件事情，复活完成了。首先，在第17节中（我没有打印出来），他说如果基督没有从死里复活，你们还是在罪中。

事实上，他用一种非常生动的方式说出了这一点。他说，如果基督还在坟墓里，你们还是在罪中。为什么会这样呢？因为复活证明了某件事情已经结束。

什么结束了？根据罗马书4:25，耶稣为我们的罪被钉死，但为我们的义而复活。这又意味着什么呢？**这意味着：当你面对死亡，当你接近死亡，当你参加一个你认识的人的葬礼时，无论这个人是谁。**

尽管这个社会会告诉你死亡是自然的、生活的一部分，你知道事实并非如此。死亡是不自然的，不对的。我们不想死，我们不愿看到亲人离去。这是不正常的事情。

死亡阻止我们复活，但我们想复活，但它阻止了我们。死亡把我们拉下深渊。死亡不对。这就是为什么迪伦·托马斯那句著名的话如此出名的原因。

迪伦·托马斯说：“我们对抗着光的消逝。”我们知道死亡不是自然的，但如果它不是自然的，那么它就是被施加的。所以你知道死亡是自然的，但如果是自然的，那就意味着它是审判、惩罚。为什么呢？

圣经给出了答案。我们生活在一个被建造的世界里，这个世界如果我们要为他人和上帝而活而不是为自己，就能正常运作。我们是为了服务他人并保存上帝而构建的。那不是我们生活的样子。

我们为了满足自己而活，利用上帝的人来达到我们的需要和目标。因此，世界无法正常运作。而在死亡中不工作是自然的结果。我们违背了现实的经纬和本质，其结果就是瓦解。

而瓦解即是死亡。因此，死亡有权威。死亡是一种审判。当耶稣基督死时，保罗说，如果他没有复活，你们仍然在罪里。

为什么？因为如果耶稣基督死了，死亡依然有效。死亡依然拥有权威。但当耶稣基督复活了，我们已经为此歌唱过。

死亡徒劳地阻止他复活。最后一首圣诗也很好，它谈论了死亡徒劳的主题。死亡不能。为什么？

因为公义已经被偿还。审判已经被偿还。当耶稣基督死的时候，他已经完成了所有必要的事情。因此，死亡徒劳。

死亡对我们没有力量。死亡对我们没有权威。因此，定罪已经结束。你看？

复活意味着定罪已经结束。复活意味着你的罪已经被偿还。上帝已经满足了你。实际上，在旧约中，一年有一天，所有人聚集在一起，大祭司在赎罪日进入幔子内。

他进去的是什么？至圣所。他要去的地方是什么？他去为百姓的罪献祭。

所有人都很紧张。为什么？因为他要回到上帝面前的直接存在前。牺牲会被接受吗？

有人屏息以待，他下去了，几乎面临死亡。他进入了幔子。但每次他在献祭后出来时，大家都会欢欣鼓舞。为什么？

因为**这意味着罪已经被偿还。**但这每年都在重复发生，正如希伯来书所说，这种方式无法完全满足良心。但当耶稣基督进入地里又出来时，这就是神对所有人说：你们的罪已经被完全偿还。因此，一方面，没有复活，你绝对没有任何信心相信神此刻看着你而满意并接纳你。

另一方面，复活不仅证明某件事已经结束。它还证明了新事物已经开始。这在第20节到第23节中得到了证实。两次。

我们被告知耶稣基督是初熟的果子。那么什么是初熟的果子呢？哇。初熟的果子意味着什么？

有一个世界，一个永恒的世界。一个完全公义的世界。一个充满爱的世界。一个没有衰老和死亡的世界。

一个充满生命、真理和美丽的世界。但那是理想中的世界。而这是现实的世界。每个人都明白，在现实世界与理想世界之间有一块坚硬的石板。

但当耶稣从死里复活时，这不仅仅是烟花表演，也不仅是裸露的力量展示。而是理想的现实进入了现实世界。耶稣基督是初熟的果子。什么是初熟的果子？

它是从花园中出来的第一样东西。它是从谷物中出来的第一样东西。它是葡萄藤上的第一个果实。它是即将到来的东西。

它就是现实，虽然是不完全的，但它确实是收获的一部分。**这意味着神未来的希望已经降临了。**在复活中，一个洞被捅破了世界的无情壁垒。死亡的世界迎来了永生。

黑暗的世界迎来了光明。当耶稣基督说：“相信我，你将获得复活。”这不仅仅是让你振奋一下，让你高兴一点。你知道，他会给你力量度过一天。

抬起头来。放弃你的小目标。圣经说，基督徒和教会是神末世学的先锋。**这意味着他的未来已经现在到来，部分但真实。**
