## 引言与经文诵读 / Introduction and Scripture Reading

Welcome to Gospel in Life. The Bible says there's a world of difference between a will-power-driven heart and a supernaturally-changed one. Today, Tim Keller is unpacking one of the fruit of the Spirit, helping us see what it means to move from trying to be good to truly changing from the inside out.

Tonight's Scripture reading is found on page 8 in your bulletin, and it comes from 1st Corinthians 9 and 10. I do all this for the sake of the Gospel that I may share in its blessings. Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize.

Run in such a way as to get the prize. Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last, but we do it to get a crown that will last forever.

Therefore, I do not run like a man running aimlessly. I do not fight like a man beating the air. No, I beat my body and make it my slave, so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize.

These things happen to them as examples, and we're written down as warnings for us on whom the fulfillment of the ages has come. So if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don't fall. No temptation has seized you except what is common to man, and God is faithful.

He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it, the word of the Lord. In Galatians 5, verse 22 and 23, Paul lists nine traits of a supernaturally changed heart.

There are also called the fruit of the Spirit, love, joy, peace, patience and so on. And what we've been doing is each week taking one of them and looking at one so that we can see these traits appear in our own lives. And tonight we come to the last one.

In the list in Galatians 5, 22 and 23, it's called self-control. And that same Greek word occurs here. It's a little bit hidden by our translation because the translation says in verse 25, everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training.

And literally, that's just a way the translators paraphrased or rendered a phrase that literally says, everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things. That's what Paul said. And the word for self-control is the same word he uses in Galatians 5.

It's the word ego crottia, which means ego, ego, self-crottia, command. Self-control is self-command. And actually it's a synonym for being free because if you're not self-controlled, then you're out of control.

If you're out of control, then you're a slave to some other forces. And so to be free and to be self-controlled is the same thing. And Paul is using this illustration of the athlete preparing for a game to compete in the game to get across the biblical understanding of self-control.

欢迎收听《生命中的福音》。圣经说，靠意志力驱动的心和被神改变的心之间有着天壤之别。今天，提摩太·基勒将为我们解开圣灵果子之一的含义，帮助我们从试图做好人转为从内而外真正改变。今晚的经文可以在你们的敬拜手册第8页找到，出自哥林多前书9章和10章。

我做这一切都是为了福音的缘故，好与众人分享它的恩典。你们岂不知，在赛跑的人中，只有一人可以得冠冕吗？你们要如此奔跑，好得冠冕。凡参加竞赛的运动员都严格训练，他们为的是得到一个不能长久的冠冕；但我们是为得到一个能长存的冠冕而努力。

所以我并不像不知道方向的人那样奔跑，也不像击打空气的人那样争战。我使自己服在律法之下，为要向别人显明律法的荣耀。我若传福音，自我的话却成了徒然；我就是愿意夸口也无所益处，因为我是爱基督耶稣的。我若从律法得义，就不算福音的使者了。

所以，这些事都是给你们作榜样，好警戒你们。原来那些从前写的圣经中的预言，是为你们指明的，叫你们借着耐心和安慰，靠着我们主耶稣基督的恩典，也能得着盼望。加拉太书5章22节至23节中，保罗列出了九种被神改变的心所具备的特质。这些特质也被称为圣灵的果子：爱、喜乐、和平、忍耐等等。

而我们在过去几周里每周探讨其中一种特质，以便我们能看见这些特质在我们生命中的体现。今晚我们将讨论最后一个特质。在加拉太书5章22节至23节的列表中，它被称为自制。同样的希腊词在这里出现，但我们的翻译稍微隐藏了这一点，因为第25节说：“凡参加竞赛的运动员都严格训练。

” 而且，这实际上是翻译者对一个词组的一种阐释或直译，这个词组的意思是：凡参赛的人都在各方面自我克制。保罗就是这样说的。“自我克制”这个词和他在加拉太书5章中使用的词是一样的。这个词是“εγκορτια”，意思是“自我克制”。

自我克制就是自我控制。实际上，“自我控制”这个词与自由是同义的，因为你如果不自我控制，就失去了控制权。如果你失去控制权，就会成为某些外力的奴隶。所以，获得自由和保持自我控制是一回事。

保罗用运动员为比赛做准备来说明这一道理，以此传达圣经中关于自我克制的理解。

## 自制力的普遍难题 / Our Universal Problem with Self-Control

Now we need this because we are not in control. We have trouble controlling our tongues. We have trouble controlling our thoughts.

We have trouble controlling our feelings, our impulses, let alone all the millions of addictions that we can also develop like addictions that have to do with drink or drugs or sex or spending or gambling or eating disorders or rage. And you can't be circumspect without coming to the end of a day and looking back and saying, why did I say that? Why did I follow that impulse?

We all have a problem with self-control. And Paul gives us his secret. And he was one of the five or six most influential people who ever lived.

He knew a lot about self-discipline, self-control. And here's what he tells us, what it is. Secondly, how it, it's born in you.

And then thirdly, how can grow? What it is? How it's born?

How it grows? First of all, what it is. There's a master illustration here.

He says, if you compete in the games and he's thinking about the panhellenic games like the Olympic games. And you're going after a prize, a crown. And by the way, you notice where he says, the crown does not last because you didn't get medals back then in the Olympic games.

You got a literal crown and it was made out of a, it was a wreath. It was a garland, you know. You've seen pictures of it.

And it did, of course, fade. You couldn't put your crown aside and 10 years later look at it. You know, it literally went to, you know, turn to dust.

But Paul is talking about the self-control that an athlete has. Because if you want that prize and if you want that crown, then everything else in your life is under control. You might want to eat, but you can only eat certain things.

You might want to sleep in, but you have to get up to exercise. You might want to stay out late, but you've got to get to better early. You know, every single thing in your life is under control.

So you get the prize. Now, that's the illustration he uses to talk about spiritual self-control and it's telling. Because let me give you two alternate approaches to virtue.

我们现在需要这一点，因为我们无法完全掌控自己。我们很难控制自己的舌头、思想、情感和冲动。更不用说那些成千上万的瘾癖了，比如酒瘾、药瘾、性瘾、购物瘾、赌博瘾或饮食障碍等。

你不能谨慎行事，除非在一天结束时回顾并问自己：我为什么要这么说？为什么我要听从那个冲动？我们都有自我控制的问题。保罗给了我们一个秘诀。

他是历史上最有影响力的人之一，无论是活着的还是已故的，大约有五到六位。他深知自律和自我控制的重要性。他说：“如果你参加比赛，比如希腊泛希腊运动会。”他指的是奥林匹克运动会。

“你追求的是奖品，是桂冠。”顺便说一句，注意他提到当时没有像现在这样用奖牌，而是用**真正的桂冠，是**由枝叶编织而成的，你知道的，你见过这样的图片。首先，我们要知道“自我控制”是什么。这里有一个主要的比喻：如果你参加比赛，追求的是桂冠。

当然，这种激情确实会消退。你不能戴上王冠十年后再去看它。它真的会变成尘土。但保罗在谈论运动员所拥有的自制力。

因为如果你想得到奖赏和那顶王冠，那么生活中的一切都必须受控。你可能想吃东西，但只能吃某些东西； 你可能想多睡一会儿，但必须早起锻炼；你想熬夜，但必须早点回家。生活中每一件事都要受控。所以你就能得到奖赏。

现在，他用这个例子来说明灵性的自制力，这是很有启发性的。让我给你讲两种不同的美德观。

## 两种有缺陷的美德观 / Two Flawed Approaches to Virtue

There's an ancient approach. It was the Greek idea, but it's still with us, that the body is bad and the spirit is good. And because the body, the Greeks thought, was the source of emotions.

And the mind was the source of your logic and your rationality. Therefore, virtue was considered, self-control was considered, the mind over the emotions. Do the logical thing, do the rational thing, and control and suppress your emotions because your emotions are your lower nature.

The alternate approach to virtue, which we have today, I mean, the older approach is still with us, but we have another approach that doesn't see your emotions as the problem. It doesn't see suppressing emotions as you're cure. It sees suppressing of emotions as the problem.

See, the modern idea says, don't do self-control, do self-discovery. Get in touch with your feelings, find your feelings, and then express them. Don't let somebody tell you what's right or wrong for you.

You find what you feel is right and wrong, what you feel you want to do, and you do it. So, get in touch with your feelings, express your feelings. That's the virtuous ideal.

And by the way, if you want an example of these two alternate competing approaches, just go watch Star Trek on TV because if you take the older Star Trek with Spock, you have the traditional approach because he was always trying to suppress his emotions. But if you go into the next TV series with data, he was always trying to express his emotions because there you have the older and the ancient traditional and the modern post-modern approach to emotions and what you're supposed to do with them. But the Bible says neither.

---

一种是古代的观点，希腊人的看法，身体不好而灵魂好。因为在古希腊人看来，身体是情绪的来源，而头脑则是逻辑和理性所在。

因此，美德被认为是理智战胜情感，做正确的事情、理性的事情，并抑制和压制你的情感，因为情感是你低级的一面。另一种现代观点则完全不同，尽管古代的观点仍然存在，但我们现在有了另一种看法，它不认为情感是问题所在，也不认为压抑情感就是解决问题的方法，而是认为压抑情感本身就是问题。按照现代的想法，不要做自我控制，要做自我发现。要接触你的情感，找到你的感受，并表达出来。

不要让别人告诉你什么是对你正确的或错误的。你要根据自己的感觉来判断什么是对的和错的，你想做什么就去做它。所以，接触你的情感并表达它们，这就是美德的理想。顺便说一句，如果你想找这两种对立竞争方法的例证，只需在电视上看《星际迷航》就行了。

因为在早期的《星际迷航》中，斯波克总是试图抑制自己的情绪，这代表了传统的方法；而在后来的系列中，数据则总是试图表达自己的情绪，这就代表了现代后现代的情绪处理方式。但圣经说这两种方法都不对。为什么这么说呢？首先想想运动员。

## 一种热情统领其余一切 / One Passion Ordering All Others

And here's the reason why. First of all, think of the athlete. Where is the self-control coming from?

Well, he has desires or she has desires to eat, to sleep, to do these very things, but they're all under control. Why? Because the athletes want the prize.

They want the crown. But let me ask you a question. Is that mind over emotion?

No. You know why? Because why do you want athletic excellence?

Why do you want athletic glory? The desire for athletic glory and athletic excellence is a desire. It's not the conclusion of the logic.

It's a passion of a heart. And what Paul is saying here in using his illustration is that it's not like, here's the mind and here's the emotions. All these passions are under control because there is one passion that controls all the rest, that masters and orders all the rest.

Because you want the prize, all the other things are under control. And see, this goes along with biblical psychology. The Bible does not divide human beings into head and heart, into faculties, like mind and emotions.

In fact, if you read the Bible carefully, you'll often be confused because there's many places where it talks about thinking from the heart. And that's because when the Bible uses the word heart, it does not mean what we mean in the English language by heart. The heart was the center of the personality according to the Bible.

And it was the place where your fundamental commitments existed. It's the metaphor for your fundamental trusts and commitments. And see what you think and what you feel and what you decide all flow from the heart because whatever you most trust, whatever you most love, whatever your heart is most passionately trusting and loving in sets the course for everything else.

And if your heart is divided, if your heart is divided and you actually don't have one single over mastering passion, then your life is going to be out of control. There's going to be all kinds of problems you have. So see, Paul's illustration here on the one hand critiques the ancient idea of mind over emotions because you see the desire for the prize is not mind versus eating is an emotion.

Oh no, actually all of our passions are combinations of thinking and feeling. And freedom and self-control is rightly ordering your loves, rightly ordering your passions, which is also a critique of the modern approach. Now here's what I mean by that.

The modern approach says, find your feelings and express them. Get in touch with your deepest feelings and follow them and express them. Well, that doesn't work.

And I'll tell you the reason it doesn't work. If you actually follow your deepest feelings, you'll find that they're also contradictory that you'll just split up. So let me give you an example.

I want to eat chocolate ice cream, not low fat, no sugar. I want chocolate ice cream and I also would like to be thinner. And they are both very strong emotions, very strong emotions.

And so, okay, modern man, modern woman, get in touch with your deep emotions and follow them. I want to eat chocolate ice cream. I want to be thin.

Follow them. You just split because they're at locker heads. Let me give you one that's maybe not as comical.

You want a career? You want a family? So you want success, but you also want relationships, one community.

And the fact is, if you want to totally be committed to your career and totally be committed to success and glory, that actually gets in the way of even nurturing a prospective marriage partner in a relationship. Certainly gets in the way of nurturing an actual marriage and nurturing your family. And the fact is, you can never be as successful as you would be if you just forgot about relationships and you can never be as strong in your relationships.

If you just go whole hog on your career, these things are at locker heads and you're going to have to choose. Often, you're going to have to choose.

自制力从哪里来？他们有吃、睡等欲望，但这些都被控制住了。为什么？因为运动员想要奖牌和荣耀。

但是我要问你一个问题：这是理性战胜情感吗？不。你知道为什么吗？因为你想获得运动上的卓越和荣耀是因为什么？

是激情，而不是逻辑的结果。保罗在这里用这个比喻的意思是，并不是说这里有个头脑，那里有情绪；所有这些激情都被控制住了，因为有一种激情在控制着所有的其他激情，驾驭并指挥着它们。因为你想要奖牌，所以其他一切都在你的掌控之中。这与圣经心理学是一致的。

圣经并没有把人分为头脑和心，分成不同的能力或功能，比如思维和情感。事实上，如果你仔细阅读圣经，你会发现很多地方提到从心中思考。这是因为当圣经用“心”这个词时，并不意味着我们英语中所说的“心”。在圣经里，“心”是指个性的核心。

这个地方体现了你最基本的承诺。它是你基本信任和承诺的隐喻。看看你的想法、感受以及决定都源自何处，因为无论你最信任什么，无论你最爱什么，你内心最热烈地信任和爱戴的东西会指引一切。如果你的心灵是分裂的，如果你没有一个主导的热情，那么你的生活就会失控，你会遇到各种各样的问题。

所以，保罗在这里用这个比喻一方面批判了古代“理性凌驾于情感”的观念，因为你会发现对奖赏的渴望并不是理性和吃东西的情感之间的对立。不，实际上我们所有的激情都是思考和感受的结合。自由与自制是正确地安排你的爱戴、正确地管理你的情感，这也是对现代方法的一种批判。现在让我解释一下我所说的“现代方法”。

现代的方法说：找到你的感觉并表达出来。接触你最深层的感觉，然后跟随它们并表达它们。但这种方法并不奏效。告诉你原因吧，如果你真的遵循你最深层的感觉，你会发现它们是矛盾的，你会分裂。

让我举个例子。我想吃巧克力冰淇淋，不是低脂、无糖的那种。我想要巧克力冰淇淋，我也想变瘦。这两种情感都非常强烈。

所以，现代人，现代女性，接触你们最深的情感并跟随它们吧。我想吃巧克力冰淇淋，我想变瘦。你就会分裂，因为它们是相互冲突的。让我再给你举一个可能不太滑稽的例子。

你想有一份事业？还想有一个家庭？你想成功，但你也想有关系、一个社区。事实上，如果你完全致力于事业，并且追求成功和荣耀，这实际上会妨碍你培养潜在的伴侣关系，甚至无法培育真正的婚姻和家庭。

你永远不可能像忽略人际关系那样取得最大的成功，也无法在人际关系中变得足够强大。如果你全身心投入自己的事业，这些目标就会发生冲突，你不得不做出选择。当然，你经常需要做出选择。

## 错乱的爱与正确排序 / Disordered Love and Rightly Ordering Desires

Now, San Augustan years ago, obviously since he's been dead a long time, San Augustan once said that sin is disordered love.

That's a brilliant understanding of what the Bible teaches. Sin is disordered love. It's loving things out of order.

So what he says, for example, is if you choose individual glory over friendship, so even over your family, you're actually going against the way in which God created the world because relationships is very, very important. If you put your own individual glory first, instead of serving other people in nurturing community, you're going against the fabric of the world. And what that means is, there will be breakdown because you're loving secondary things as if they were primary.

And you're loving primary things that they're secondary. You're loving things out of order. And if you have disordered love, it leads to breakdown.

And so the modern idea that you just get in touch with your feelings and you just discover them and you get in touch with them and you express them makes no sense because we have all these contradictory feelings, you have to decide which are the liberating ones. See, it's more liberating to use the desire to have good health and to lose weight, to master the need to eat every time you see something. Because in the long run, if you live twice as long, you'll eat a lot more chocolate ice cream in the end.

In other words, which of those two desires should be given the priority? Which one should you choose? Which one should you let engage your heart more so that you can control the other one?

You have to find the right one. You have to find the one that fits in with your design. In that case, the design of your body.

And so Augustine says, if you rightly order your loves, you will become increasingly a self-controlled, free person or put it this way. Unlike what the ancient say, unlike what the modern say, self-control is not a matter of mind over emotions. It's not a matter of just being in touch with your feelings.

It's loving, supreme things, supremely. It's finding those supreme things and letting them engage your heart wholly, undividedly, and that brings self-control. Because you can see it.

Paul's using an illustration of an athlete. And he knows it's a limited illustration. I do know certain athletes that have really pretty much in their physical life because they want the prize, they want the gold medal or whatever.

They actually have their physical life in an enormous order. You can't pinch an inch. They're perfect about what they eat.

They're perfect about how they sleep. They're perfect about exercise. Perfect.

And yet, of course, because they have this, as Paul says, their goal is a crown that will not last. They also only, because they have a limited crown, a limited prize, they only have limited self-control because they might have physical self-control very often in no offense to those of you who have been athletes or are athletes. You know, you can have your body under incredible control and your soul be utterly a wreck.

You know, destructive perfectionism, fears, anger, everything. Paul saying, if you love the supreme thing supremely, if you seek the crown that will last forever, then everything in your life, if you're able to get your heart fully and supremely rested in that, everything else in your life will start to come together. Well, so that leads us to this question.

很久以前，圣奥古斯丁说过："罪就是错乱的爱。

” 这是一个深刻的对圣经教导的理解：罪就是错乱的爱，即把爱的对象弄错了。例如，他指出，如果你为了个人荣耀而牺牲友谊，甚至牺牲家庭，实际上你就违背了上帝创造世界的方式，因为人际关系非常重要。如果你把自己的个人荣耀放在首位，而不是为他人服务并培育社区，你就在破坏世界的本质结构。**这意味着会有崩溃，因为你将次要的事物当作主要的来爱，把主要的事物当作次要的来爱，即错乱地去爱。**

如果爱是错乱的，它会导致崩溃。现代的想法认为，你应该接触自己的情感，发现它们并表达出来是没有意义的，因为这些情感往往是矛盾的。你必须决定哪些是解放性的。换句话说，比如，你是更应该追求健康和减肥的愿望，还是满足每看到食物就吃的需求？

从长远来看，如果你活得比现在长一倍，你最终会吃掉更多的巧克力冰淇淋。换句话说，你应该选择哪个愿望来优先考虑？哪一个应该让你的心更加投入，从而控制另一个？> 你必须决定哪些情感是解放性的。

你必须找到那个合适的。找到与你的设计相契合的那个。那就是你身体的设计。于是，奥古斯丁说，如果你正确地安排了你的爱慕对象，你会变得越来越自律、自由的人。

或者说，就像古人所说的，现代人所说的那样，自律并不是情绪的自我控制。它不是仅仅与自己的感受保持联系的问题。而是对至高无上的事物有最深沉的爱慕。找到那些至高无上的事物，并让它们完全、毫无保留地触动你的心灵，这样就能带来自律。

因为你可以看到这一点。保罗用了一个运动员的例子来说明这个问题。他知道这个比喻是有限的。确实有一些运动员在他们的身体生活中非常严格，因为他们想要奖牌，想要金牌等等。

他们把整个身体生活都安排得井井有条。不能有一点松懈。他们在饮食上完美无缺，在睡眠上也十分讲究，在锻炼方面更是毫不含糊。然而，正如保罗所说，他们的目标是一个不会持续的桂冠。

因为这个桂冠是有限的，所以他们的自律也是有限的。他们可能在身体上非常自律，但这并不意味着他们的灵魂会完全不受影响。可能会有破坏性的完美主义、恐惧、愤怒等一切问题。保罗说，如果你对至高无上的事物有最深沉的爱慕，如果你追求那将永远存在的桂冠，那么你生活中的一切，如果能让你的心灵完全和毫无保留地安息在这一点上，其他一切都将会开始变得井然有序。

## 永恒的冠冕是什么 / The Crown That Lasts Forever

What is that crown that will last forever? What is it? So in other words, how does this self-control really happen in our lives?

And the answer is, it's not as simple as you think, because when you read that and you say, ah, you know, they run for a crown that will not last, but we run for a crown that will last forever, we say, oh, I know what that means. It's a heavenly crown. Paul's talking about his salvation that someday he's going to stand before God and God's going to say, well done, good and faithful that's what I'm carrying.

I want to please God, I want to do his will, I want to be accepted by him, I want his salvation. Now you think that's what Paul's saying? That that's the prize, that that's the crown that will last forever?

Uh-uh. Because I mean, if that's what he was saying that he's working so hard to be a good Christian, he's working so hard to be a good Christian leader, so someday he knows God will bless him and accept him and save him. If he's saying that, he's contradicting everything else he said anywhere else in the Bible.

Because everywhere Paul's always saying, I am saved in Christ, I am accepted. Salvation is a gift, it's not something I run for, it's not something I, you know, I work for, so I don't want to be disqualifies from the prize, you see verse 27, is he saying that if I don't really live a very good life, I might find in the end that I'm not saved? No, he couldn't be saying that.

Well then what is it? With Christmas just around the corner, we are inviting people to sign up for our Advent devotional series, which you can receive daily from November 30th to December 24th. The daily meditations will help you take time to think about the meaning and joy that comes from Christ's birth.

Each day of Advent, you'll receive a devotional with a meditation on a Bible passage that focuses on why Jesus came into the world, to reconcile us to our Heavenly Father. We believe that during this short season, this is a great tool to help you focus on the hope, joy, peace, and love we have through Christ's birth. You can sign up by visiting gospelonlife.com slash Advent.

Again, to sign up, go to gospelonlife.com slash Advent. In addition to the daily emails, you'll also receive a video message each Sunday. The weekly video message starts each week of Advent with a meditation from Tim Keller, followed by a brief discussion with Tim and Kathy talking about something they noticed in the meditation.

It's our prayer that through this Advent series, you experience the hope and joy that comes from Christ's birth and that it is a source of encouragement to you this Advent season. Now here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching.

所以这就引出了一个问题：那个将永远存在的桂冠究竟是什么？它是什么？换句话说，在我们的生活中，这种自律是如何发生的呢？答案是，这并不是你想的那么简单，因为当你读到这段经文并说：“哦，我知道了，他们追求一个不能长久的王冠，但我们追求的是一个永远长存的王冠。

”你以为这就明白了吗？保罗说的是天上的一顶王冠。保罗在谈论他的得救，他说有一天他会站在神面前，神会说：“很好，你忠心服侍我，这就是我要找的人。” 我想讨神喜悦，我想遵行他的旨意，我想被他接纳，我想得到他的拯救。

你以为保罗就是这么说的吗？他认为那才是永恒不朽的奖赏？不对。因为如果他是这样说的——他努力做一个好基督徒，努力成为一个好的基督教领袖，只是希望有一天神会祝福他、接受他、拯救他。

如果他说的是这个意思，那就和他在圣经其他地方所说的完全矛盾了。因为在保罗所有的言论中，他总是说：“我在基督里得救了，我已经被接纳。” 他说救恩是礼物，不是我们追求的东西，也不是我们要努力争取的，所以我不能因为没有很好地活出基督徒的样子而失去奖赏。看第27节，他难道是在说如果我不好好生活，最后可能会发现我没有得救吗？

不，他不可能这么说。那么那是什么意思呢？圣诞节即将来临，我们邀请大家参加我们的圣诞灵修系列，从11月30日到12月24日每天都可以收到。这些每日的灵修会帮助你思考基督诞生的意义和带来的喜乐。

在每个圣诞灵修的日子里，你会收到一个灵修内容，其中包含一篇以圣经经文为中心的反思，聚焦于耶稣为什么来到这个世界，为了使我们与天父和好。我们认为在这个短暂的季节里，这是一个很好的工具来帮助你专注于通过基督诞生所拥有的希望、喜乐、平安和爱。你可以通过访问gospelonlife.com/Advent进行注册。再次提醒，要注册，请访问 [gospelonlife.com/Advent](http://gospelonlife.com/Advent)。

除了每日邮件外，您还将每周收到一次视频信息。每周的视频信息将从圣诞节前的每一周开始，包含蒂姆·凯勒的一段沉思，之后是蒂姆和凯西简短讨论他们在沉思中注意到的内容。我们希望通过这个圣诞系列，您能体验到基督诞生所带来的希望与喜悦，并成为您在这个圣诞季节的鼓励。现在，请听蒂莫西·凯勒博士继续今天的教导。

## 活出福音作为人生至高目标 / Embodying the Gospel as Life's Supreme Goal

See, the goal that will give you self-control, by the way, I've been very convicted by this over the years. This is not what you might think. The goal that brings self-control, the Paul's talking about, this crown, is not just pleasing God, of course you're going to please God.

It's not that general, it's not that abstract, it's in verse 23. He says, I do all this for the sake of the gospel, but I may share in its blessings. Now again, the English, on the surface, even that looks like he's saying this, I am striving with all my might that someday I might experience the blessings of salvation in my life.

That's not what he's saying. Here's the reason why. First of all, the word share, there's two aspects of this very complex verb that can't be gotten across with the simple English translation.

First of all, the word share means share with others, something you already have. So the first thing he's saying is, the great passion of my life is not to get salvation, I've already got it, but to share the blessings that I'm having. And what Paul is saying is I'm experiencing some kind of bliss, some kind of joy, some kind of beauty, something in the gospel, and I don't want to enjoy it alone.

I'm more than anything else want to make sure that other people are enjoying it too, but that's not always talking about. Because this word that can be translated share can also be translated, participate. And what he's saying is, I want to participate in the gospel in such a way that all kinds of other people experience the blessings I'm having in it.

What does that mean? And all the commentators are actually in agreement about Paul is trying to say not simply that he wants to evangelize people, not simply that he's just trying to proclaim the gospel so you can see a lot of people get converted. That's not what he's saying.

Only what he's actually saying is, I want to so embody the gospel, I want to so participate in the gospel, I want to so reflect the gospel, I want to so display the gospel in my life that anybody, anybody at all who looks into my heart into my life will see how the gospel operates, will see the beauty that I see at it. And this is an absolutely comprehensive life goal. See, if I really thought of this as mainly that his great goal is just simply to see a lot of other people become Christians like he is, if that was, if I adopted that as a goal, it wouldn't be enough to give me self control, you know why?

If my goal was to see a lot of people become Christians, I would work strictly on my rhetorical skills. I would make sure that I totally discipline the parts of my life I needed to discipline in order to stand up here and do what I'm doing right now really well. But there's all kinds of other things that I would be free to do, you know, otherwise there's all, by the way, I have to tell you this, you can definitely be a great performer and some of you know this.

You can be an incredible performer. You can even be a great Christian teacher, a great Christian preacher, a great Christian evangelist, while other parts of your life are falling apart. Because if the goal, if this overarching goal is strictly just that, it's only to, you know, see people become Christians and all that, that's not the only goal.

The goal is to say, I want anybody who looks deep into my heart to see that the gospel completely dominates me, that if you want to understand how the gospel works, if you want to understand how God's salvation works, I'll embody it for you. I'll display it for you. I'll represent it.

I'll reflect it. And if that is Paul, Paul's telling us, if that is the over mastering unified passion of your life, it is the supreme passion of your life. It's not just one good thing that you like to get done among others.

If it's the supreme passion of your life, you're going to find it brings everything else into self-control, under control. You say, well, how do I even get started with that? Here's how you get started with that.

When Paul says in verse 26 and 27, I'm like a runner, see? I do not run like a man running aimlessly. I beat my body and make it my slave.

By the way, that, don't be thrown by verse 27. I beat my body. That's not Paul saying the body is bad.

He's not an ascetic here, like the ancient ascetics that really thought the body was bad, the spirit is good, so they just hurt their body just to become more spiritual. He's not talking like that. He's working through the metaphor of the athlete.

He is saying that just as an athlete runs until your heart feels like it's going to give out, runs even though you're in agony, runs and runs. He says, I am like a runner, spiritually speaking, not physically. Why?

Because of this incredible goal. So when he says that life, and I love that, the idea of life being a race, it's not a santa, it's not a walk through the woods, life is a race because life is hard, life is challenging. See, your heart constantly feels like it's a breaking.

That's another good thing, but I can tell you, the only time I've ever really run very long distances, I feel like my heart is just going to explode. And frankly, that's life. Your heart's always breaking.

It's hard, so life is like a race. Paul says, and I'm in the race, but I'm trying to race in such a way that I get my crown. Well, you know what?

要知道，目标是为了获得自制力这一点，顺便说一句，多年来我一直被这一点深深触动。保罗所说的这一目标并不是你可能想象的那种。为了得到自控，他所指的桂冠，不仅仅是取悦上帝——当然你会取悦上帝。这不是一个泛泛的概念，也不是抽象的目标，在第23节中他明确指出：“我做这一切都是为了福音的缘故，好使我在福音上不至于空跑。

” 乍一看，这句话似乎意味着保罗正努力奋斗，希望有一天能在自己的生命中体验到救恩的福分。但这并不是他的意思。原因如下：首先，“分享”这个词包含两方面的含义，在简单的英语翻译中无法完全表达出来。一方面，“分享”意味着与他人共享你已经拥有的东西。

所以他说的第一点是，我一生的伟大热情不是为了得到拯救——我已经得到了它，而是要与他人分享我在其中所经历的福分。保罗的意思是他正在体验某种喜悦、美善或福音中的某种美好，并不想独自享受。另一方面，“分享”也可以理解为“参与”。他所说的正是：我希望以一种方式参与到福音中去，使得各种各样的人都能体验到我在其中所拥有的福分。

那是什么意思？而所有注释家实际上都一致认为，保罗想要表达的不仅仅是他想传福音，不仅仅是要宣扬福音好让更多人得救。这并不是他的意思。他真正要说的是：我想以福音为生命，我想参与福音，我想反映福音，我想在生命中展示福音，以至于任何看到我内心、我的生活的人，都能看到福音是如何运作的，能看到我在其中所见到的美好。

这是一个全方位的人生目标。你看，如果我认为这个主要目标只是让更多人像他一样成为基督徒，如果我把这作为自己的目标，那不足以让我有自制力，你知道为什么吗？如果我的目标仅仅是让更多人成为基督徒，我只会专注于提升我的演讲技巧。我会确保自己在各方面都严格自律，以便能站在这里做得很好。

但还有很多其他的事情我可以自由去做。顺便告诉你一件事，你一定要知道，你可以成为一个非常出色的表演者。你可以是一个极其出色的表演者。甚至可以成为一名优秀的基督教教师、牧师或传道人，而你的生活中的其他方面却可能一团糟。

因为如果这个总体目标仅仅是这样——只看到很多人成为基督徒——那不是唯一的目标。目标应该是：我想让任何深入我内心的人看到福音完全支配着我，如果你想了解福音如何运作，如果你想知道上帝的救赎是如何工作的，我会为你展示它、体现它并代表它。我会反思这一点。如果这真的是保罗所说的，那么保罗在告诉我们，如果你的生命中主导的热情是这样的，那就是你生命中的最高热情。

它不仅仅是你众多事情中的一件好事。如果你的生命中有这种最高热情，你会发现它会把其他一切都置于自我控制之下。你会问，那我怎么开始呢？这是你如何开始的方法。

当保罗在第26和27节说：“我就像一个赛跑者，看哪！我不是像一个盲目奔跑的人。” 我鞭打我的身体，让它成为我的奴隶。顺便说一句，不要被第27节吓到。

我鞭打我的身体，并不是保罗认为身体是坏的。他并不是一个禁欲主义者，像古代那些禁欲主义者那样认为身体不好、精神好，所以他们故意伤害自己的身体以变得更精神。他不是在谈论这个。他在使用运动员的比喻来说明问题。

他说就像一个运动员一样一直跑下去，直到你的心脏感觉快要停止跳动，即使你在痛苦中也继续跑。他说：“我是一个赛跑者，从灵性上来说，而不是肉体上的。” 为什么呢？因为有这个令人难以置信的目标。

所以当他说到生命时——我喜欢这个想法，把生活比作一场赛跑的概念——它不是圣诞老人的游行，也不是在森林里散步，而是因为生活艰难、充满挑战。你看，你的心脏总是感觉快要碎了。这也是好事之一，但我可以告诉你，我真正长距离跑步的时候，感觉自己心脏都要爆裂了。老实说，这就是生活。

你的心脏总是破碎的感觉。生活艰难，所以生活就像一场赛跑。保罗说：“我在赛跑中，但我努力以一种方式赛跑，这样我能得到我的桂冠。” 好吧？

## 耶稣为我们跑完全程 / Jesus Ran the Race for Us

Paul's not the only person that talks about life for us being a race. In the book of Hebrews, it also says life is like a race, but the book of Hebrews gives us the secret for how you can run in such a way that you're not disqualified. Because in Hebrews chapter 12, we read this, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles and let us run with endurance, the race that is marked out for us.

How? Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scored its shame and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. See what the book of Hebrews is saying?

If you want to run well, look to Jesus because he ran well. Jesus was a runner. Jesus left heaven and came to earth and became a human being, and he ran the race of being a human being, and he ran all the way to the cross, and he endured, and he never gave up.

Even though not only did he feel like his heart was breaking, but Jesus' heart actually did break, because when they spirit him, out came blood and water. Well, why did he run? For the prize, what was the prize?

The joy that set before him. What was that? What joy did Jesus Christ have to come to earth to win that he didn't already have in heaven?

Did he come to earth and he ran for the glory of the Father? Yeah, but he already was living for the glory of the Father. I mean, he already had that.

Was he trying to love Father? Yes, of course, when he was on earth, he loved the Father, but he already had that. What prize did he not have that he could only win if he came to earth and ran the race and went to the cross?

What's the answer? You and me, you were Jesus' crown, you were Jesus' glory, you were the most precious thing, and when he ran that race, you realized that he was the only human being that ever ran the race who deserved the crown of life. See, Jesus Christ loved God with all his heart, soul, strength, and mind, and he loved his neighbors himself just like you and I are supposed to be living.

But you see, none of us love God like we should. None of us love each other, other people as we should. We're all disqualified.

None of us should get the crown. Jesus is the only human being who ever ran the race that deserved the crown of life, right? But when he ran that race perfectly and he got the end of his life, what did he get?

Oh, he got a crown. What was it? Was the crown of thorns?

He got a wreath on his head too. But he took the crown of thorns that you and I deserve for the way in which we've run. See, we were disqualified, but he took the crown of thorns so that when you believe in him, we get the crown of life that his running of the race earned.

You don't consider that beautiful. You don't find that astounding. Whenever you see something of incredible beauty, you want other people to see it and share in its blessings, don't you?

When you hear great music, don't you grab your friend and say, you know, stick your iPod in their careers? Listen to this because you want the person to go, wow, why? Well, you love your friend, but also your friend's joy in the same beauty completes your joy in it.

The more he or she enjoys what you found beautiful, the more you enjoy it to. It's just natural. It's just an impulse.

And what Paul is saying is when I see what Jesus did for me, how he ran the race and he took the crown of thorns and I might have the crown of life. When I realized that I am his crown, you are his crown. When I realized he loves us like that, that what?

That's beautiful. And that captures my imagination and that captures my heart. There's a place in the book of Psalms where the Psalmist says, you knight my heart to fear thy name.

See, our hearts are divided. That's how we don't have self-control. You knight my heart.

And this will do it. Looking at the gospel, looking into the beauty and the love of the gospel and the grace of the gospel until it just becomes the over mastering passion of your life, that unites your life, unites your heart. And then you've got something that will bring every part of your life into control.

保罗不是唯一一个把我们的生命比作一场赛跑的人。希伯来书也说生活是一场赛跑，但希伯来书给了我们如何才能不被取消资格的秘诀。因为在希伯来书第12章中，我们读到：“让我们丢弃一切拦阻我们的重担和容易缠累我们的罪，按着前面所摆明的道路，专心奔跑。” 如何做到？

让我们定睛在耶稣身上，他是我们信心的创始成终者。他为了面前的喜乐，忍受了十字架的羞辱，如今坐在神宝座右边。希伯来书在这里说了什么？如果你想跑好人生的赛程，请注视耶稣，因为他是优秀的选手。

耶稣从天上来到地上，成为人，并且完成了作为人的赛程，一直跑到十字架前，他从未放弃。即使他的心仿佛要碎了——耶稣的心真的碎了，当他们把他举起时，流出的是血和水。那么，他为什么要跑呢？为了什么奖赏？

是为了面前的喜乐。那是什么样的喜乐呢？耶稣基督来到地上赢得的喜乐，他在天上原本没有吗？他来地上是为了荣耀天父？

是的，但他已经在荣耀天父了。也就是说，他已经拥有那份荣耀。他是要爱天父吗？当然，当他在地上时确实爱着天父，但他已经拥有了这份爱。

那么，他缺少什么奖赏，只有通过来到地上跑完全程并走上十字架才能赢得呢？答案是：你和我。你们是耶稣的冠冕，是最珍贵的存在。当耶稣完成那场赛程时，人们意识到他是唯一配得上生命冠冕的人。

你看，耶稣基督全心爱神，用他的全灵、全魂、全力去爱神，并且像我们应当做的那样爱人。但你看到没有，我们当中没有人能完全爱神，也没有人能像我们应该的那样彼此相爱。我们都失去了资格。我们都不配得那冠冕。

耶稣是唯一一个跑完赛程并配得上生命冠冕的人，对吧？但他完美地完成了赛程，在生命的终点得到了什么？哦，他得到了一顶冠冕。那是什么样的冠冕呢？

是荆棘冠冕吗？他也戴上了花环。但他却为我们所应得的荆棘冠冕，承受了刺冠。你看，我们被取消资格了，但祂却承担了荆棘冠冕，好让我们在相信祂的时候，能够得到那属祂赛跑所得的生命冠冕。

这你并不觉得美？这你并不觉得令人惊讶？每当你看到某样极其美丽的事物时，你不希望别人也能分享这份祝福吗？当你听到美妙的音乐，你不是否想拉着朋友说：“来，把你的 iPod 给我，听一下这首歌吧。

因为你想让他们也惊叹：为什么呢？因为你爱他们，但他们的喜悦也是你对这种美之享受的一部分。” 他们越能感受到你发现的那份美丽，你就越能从中获得满足感。这很自然，这是一种本能。

保罗所说的正是这样：当我看到耶稣为我所做的一切——祂跑完赛程，承受了荆棘冠冕，而我也可能得到生命冠冕时；当我知道我是祂的冠冕，你是祂的冠冕时；当我知道祂如此爱我们时，那是什么？这很美。这激发了我的想象力，也打动了我的心。在诗篇中有一处地方，诗人说：“你用金环将我的心勒住，使我敬畏你的名。

” 你看，我们的内心是分裂的，这就是为什么我们缺乏自制力。你用金环将我的心勒住。而这个方法就能做到这一点：通过阅读福音书、欣赏福音中的美丽和爱以及恩典，直到它成为你生活的主导激情，使你的生活和心灵统一起来。然后你就会拥有一个能够控制你生命各个方面的力量。

## 三个实际的成长途径 / Three Practical Means of Growth

I think I need to, you know, I know that if you stop here without any kind of practical guidelines, some people say, this is inspiring, but I'm not sure how to get my hands on it around it. At the very, the last three verses there, which I actually called out of chapter 10, which is a little further down in the text, there's actually three very practical things there that will help you, I think, see this kind of self-control grow. And here's what those three things are, the Bible, community, and trouble.

The Bible, community, and trouble. Those three things will press you to look to Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith. And the more you look at him and the more you love him and the more you see him, the more your life will come under control.

What are those three things? First of all, look at verse 11. This is very fast.

These things happen to them as examples and were written down. Now he's looking, actually he's referring to what he just talked about in the book of Exodus. He was quoting the book of Exodus and about the wilderness wanderings of Israel.

And he was using this earlier in the chapter to apply to them. And here's what I conclude. When you see Jesus Christ being tempted.

And what's the temptation? Attemptation is a test of your self-control. Whenever Jesus is attacked by Satan, whenever Jesus is attacked by the religious leaders, even when Jesus is attacked by his executioners and crucified, how did he handle every temptation?

Scripture. He quoted Scripture. He knew the Scripture.

He was so saturated in the Scripture that whatever happened, it came to mind. And that's the first practical thing I can tell you for self-control. No matter what your problem with self-control is, if when you're being tested, the Scripture just comes right to mind.

It's an amazing help because it automatically turns your heart to look to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith. You need a so-no Scripture, so memorized Scripture, so be saturated in it. That when the test comes, it comes to mind.

And that's the first very, very practical way to have this self-control grow. Secondly, community. Because verse 12 says, so if you think you are standing firm, be careful you don't fall.

That's an exhortation. He's telling the Corinthians, you are overconfident. You're overconfident and you're setting yourself up for a fall.

What is he doing? He's rebuking them. He's exhorting them.

And I can tell you this, you will never experience growth in self-control. If you don't open your heart to a few other Christians who can hold you accountable, who can speak into your life as it were. Hebrews 3-13 exhort one another daily, lest you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.

You've got to have people who can come and talk to you or you will not grow in self-control. So Bible, community accountability, but lastly, look at the last verse, which I already started to read, no temptation has seized you. The tests, they come upon you, difficulties, difficulties, they test your self-control.

No temptation has seized you, except which is common to other people. God is faithful, and he won't let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you're tempted, he will provide a way out so you can stand up under it.

And all this, you can have a whole sermon on this, but I can point this out to you. No one grows in self-control unless tests seize you, difficulties seize you, and you just have to cling to God in his faithfulness to get you through it. Nobody ever really knew where you had problems with self-control unless tests come into your life that show you you don't have the self-control you thought.

And therefore, unless you have difficulties, difficulties that drive you into the arms of God, and difficulties that drive you into the arms of your community, your friends, and drive you into the scripture, you're not going to grow in self-control. But every time these things happen, these tests and trials, you just go to God and say, Lord Jesus, make by self to me a living bright reality. Be more real to me than you ever been before.

And he will be. And more and more, you will grow in self-control. Let's pray.

Our Father, we all struggle with self-control. And actually, our struggles in very many cases are rather secret. Not all of them.

Plenty of us have struggles with self-control that all of our friends can see. But there's an awful lot of our struggles that we keep pretty secret. And I pray that you would take the search light of your word, and with the power of your spirit, take these these words of the scripture into our hearts where we maybe keep things rather dark.

We don't want to admit our problems. We don't know what to do with them. And I pray that the words of this text of the Word of God will illuminate our hearts so we know what we should be doing.

We pray that you would help us be more accountable to each other. We would cling more to you, that we would deal with these problems because they're hurting us, and they're hurting, especially, our ability to help other people share in the blessings of the gospel. Oh, Lord, help us.

Please help us to grow in grace in the knowledge of your Son, Jesus Christ, and His name we pray. Amen. Thanks for listening to Tim Keller on The Gospel on Life Podcast.

我觉得我需要这样做。你知道，如果你在这里停下来没有给出任何实际的指导方针，有些人可能会说：“这很有启发性，但我还不知道如何将其应用到生活中。” 在第10章的最后一节中，实际上有三件非常实用的事情可以帮助你实现这一点。以下是这三件事： 1. 圣经 2. 社交团体 3. 困难 圣经、教会和患难。

这三样东西会促使你转向耶稣，我们的信心的创始成终者。你越看祂、越爱祂、越认识祂，你的生命就越能受到控制。那么，这三样东西是什么呢？首先，请看第11节。

这里非常快。这些事都是作为榜样写下来的，并且是为他们预备教训的。现在他指的是刚刚在出埃及记中提到的内容。他在引用出埃及记中的内容，关于以色列人在旷野漂流的经历。

在这里，他早些时候用这个来应用到他们身上。我得出的结论是：当你看到耶稣基督被试探时， 试探是什么？试探是对自我控制的考验。每当撒旦攻击耶稣、宗教领袖攻击耶稣，甚至当耶稣被钉十字架时，他是如何处理每一次试探的？

圣经。他引用了圣经。他知道圣经。他对圣经如此熟悉，无论发生什么事，都会想到。

这就是我第一个实际建议给你的关于自我控制的方法。无论你遇到什么自我控制的问题，在受到考验时，圣经立刻浮现在脑海中。这是一个巨大的帮助，因为它会自动让你的心转向耶稣，我们的信心的创始成终者。你需要牢记于心的圣经经文，要浸透在其中。

当考验来临时，它就会浮现出来。这也是使你的自我控制能力增长的第一个非常实际的方法。其次，是教会。因为第12节说：“所以你们以为站得稳的，须要谨慎，免得跌倒。

” 这是一个劝勉。他是在告诫哥林多人，他们过于自信，自认为不会跌倒。他在做什么？他在责备他们、劝勉他们。

我可以告诉你，如果你不敞开心扉接受几位其他基督徒的监督和鼓励——他们可以像在你生命中说话一样对你讲话，希伯来书3:13就劝勉彼此，免得被罪迷惑，心硬了。你必须有人可以和你交谈，否则你在自制方面的成长就会停滞。所以圣经、社区问责制都很重要，但最后来看一下最后一节经文，我已经开始读了：“没有试探临到你们，是不能忍耐的。”这些试炼，这些困难接踵而至，考验你的自制力。

没有哪一种试探会临到你，是你别人也不会遇到的。神是信实的，他不会让你受的试炼超过你能承受的程度。但当你受到试探时，他会为你预备一条出路，使你可以站立得住。这一切都可以成为一整篇讲道的主题，但我可以指出这些：没有人能在没有试炼和困难的情况下成长自制力。

除非试炼降临到你的身上，困难迫使你依靠神的信实，否则你不会在自制力上有所长进。没有人真正了解自己在自制方面的问题，除非生活中出现了考验，暴露了你所不知道的问题。因此，除非你面临困难，这些困难把你推向神、社区和朋友以及圣经面前，否则你在自制力上就不会成长。但每当这些试炼和磨难发生时，你就去向耶稣祷告：“主耶稣啊，求你使我的自我不再只是个概念，而是活生生的现实，比以往任何时候都更真实。

” 他会这样做的，并且你会越来越有自制力。我们来祷告。我们的父神，我们都挣扎在自制上。实际上，在很多情况下，这些挣扎是秘密的。

不是所有的都是如此。许多人的自制问题是我们朋友都能看到的，但有很多问题是隐藏得很深的。我祈求你用圣经的光束照亮我们的心，借着圣灵的能力把这些话语铭刻在我们心中，使我们不再把事情藏得太深。我们不想承认自己的问题，不知道如何处理它们。

我祈求神的话语光照我们的内心，让我们知道应该做什么。我们祈求你帮助我们在彼此之间更加负责任。让我们更紧紧地依靠你，处理这些问题，因为它们正在伤害我们，并且尤其损害了我们帮助他人分享福音祝福的能力。哦，主啊，请帮助我们。

请帮助我们在认识你的儿子耶稣基督的知识中增长恩典。奉他的名我们祷告。阿门。感谢您收听提摩太·基勒在《生命中的福音》播客上的讲道。
