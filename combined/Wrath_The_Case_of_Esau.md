## 一个饶恕的故事 / A Story of Forgiveness

Let me tell you about another family. A lady named Amy Federiki lives in the New York area, and she and her family was the subject of a major article in the New York Times back in January. She had a pretty hard life, because when she was 26, she got married, and a few weeks after she got married, she found her husband had pancreatic cancer, and a few, three months after that, he died, and only one, she's a widow at 26.

One year later, she was commuting home from her Manhattan job to her home in Queens on Long Island, and she was in the car, and a man got up in the car, turned around and started shooting everybody, and she was one of the six people who were killed in the Long Island railroad massacre. She was part of a very close family, and the article goes on to show how remarkable that family was in its response to the whole tragedy. One of the first things that the family did was they donated Amy's organs to three people and saved their lives.

One of the experts in organ donation points out this family is so odd, because generally, when a family is able to give to donate organs at a moment of crisis, a tragedy, grief, accident, they can't bear usually to see the person who got the organ. They don't want a relationship with them, they don't even want to see them, yet this family reached out to those people, brought them into their lives, are now very good friends, and you know, this is typical of the New York Times. The real story is this, where did these people get this self-control?

This is what it says in the Times, get this. It says, instead of turning bitter, as many of the others involved in this tragedy did, the family is forgiven. Born again Christians, the family speaks gently of Mr.

Ferguson. We have been much in prayer for that man, they say. Their attitude is totally amazing to others, and one of the organ recipients has said, I could never have been that forgiving.

Here's what's interesting. This family looked behind the death dealer to death, looked behind the evil doer to evil, and released and spent their anger on the death and on the evil instead of on the evil doer. And as a result, instead of their anger spending them and controlling them and keeping them imprisoned in their past, they spent their anger to do some tremendous good.

Two different families. One in the Bible, one right here in New York. What's the secret?

How can you make sure that your anger does not imprison you and control you? How can you make sure that you control it? The writer of the Hebrews gives us some principles, and I'm just going to briefly mention them.

First of all, it tells you what anger is, and then secondly, it tells you three ways to handle it. Let's just look at them. Can't spend the time that we like to, but let's at least lay them out.

First of all, what anger is, you know what it tells us about anger? Esau was sexually immoral and godless, it says, and he had a root of bitterness. Now the sexually immoral is probably a bad translation and probably would be better translated apostate, but the interesting word is he was godless, and that's not a very good translation either.

The word that literally means secular, a person focused on the immediate. Now, let me put it in a very stark way, I mean, we could lay it out in a kind of abstract principle. We could say, anger is always tied to that which is your focus, but let me put it in a much more stark way, it'll get your attention.

Anger is always an outgrowth of love. Anger is that which rouses you and rallies all of your faculties to defend that which you ultimately love. You get angry to the degree you love something.

Anger is that which defends the thing which is threatened which you love. Your hierarchy of loves is your hierarchy of anger. Things that you don't love at all don't get you angry when they're threatened.

Things that you love a little get you a little angry when they're threatened. Things that you love a lot make you very angry when you're threatened. You are as angry as you are loving and you are angry when that which you love is threatened.

That's what anger is. And the reason that's very important to see, it's very embarrassing. When we see great injustice being done, we get this a little bit angry and when our plans for our day off are completely thwarted, we're furious.

When God gets angry and he's angry at sin all the time, why? Because he loves the right, the good and he loves his creation which is what sin is destroying. When he saw gets angry, it's because he loves his belly, he loves power, he loves the now.

See, we put it to you that way suddenly it gets pretty embarrassing and it gets very telling and it shows two quick things, two quick little things. When we realize that anger is a function of defending what you love and to the degree you love something, you see the way you find out what you're really love is follow your anger, follow your anger down. What you most get angry at, what you most get furious at and what you little bit get furious at and what you don't get furious about it all, that'll tell you what you love a little what you love, not at all, what you love the most.

The reason I say it's very telling is it tells us two things. First of all, it shows us why anger in the Bible is not a sin in itself. Oh no, it's not.

God gets angry, Jesus gets angry, they're perfect. In fact, in Psalm 4 and in Ephesians 4, we are told this, Christians are told, be angry, but sin not, be angry. Do you know that there is a place in the Bible, at least two places, Ephesians 4 and so where Christians are commanded to be angry, you know why?

If you never get angry at anything, it means you love nothing. In fact, the Bible says there are many situations in which a failure to be angry is a sin because of the failure to love. There's a lot of people around who say, oh I'm a Christian, I don't get angry.

That is an Eastern or a pagan stoicism, it's not Christianity, you'll never see the Bible talk about anger like that. The Stoics, you know, Marcus Aurelius, even a lot of Eastern religions say, the important thing, if you want to have power and control, if you want to be a strong person, don't let anything get to you, never let them see you sweat, never let them see you. You know what that is?

Yeah, that gives you power, it kills your humanity. The Bible says, if you never get angry, it means that you have made yourself indifferent to everything except what? Your self-control, suddenly the important thing is that I'm never affected and that's the only thing you love is your equilibrium and that's why you never get angry.

That's a terribly wrong thing to say, the Christians never get angry. If you don't ever get angry, it shows that things you ought to love, you don't. Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty and heartache.

We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way and what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing this month, what is wrong with the world?

Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer. Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer, Dr. Keller shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing.

Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes or choices or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world will help you see how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us. This newly released book What Is Wrong with the World is our thanks for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the good news of Jesus.

他在自我安慰。他一想到要砍掉你的头就觉得舒服些。他一直怀恨在心。雅各必须离开，不需要再进一步说明，只需知道当以撒实际上为以扫祝福时，他预言以扫将一生生活在刀剑之中，以扫将是一个被愤怒驱使的人。

让我给你讲另一个家庭的故事。艾米·费德里基女士住在纽约地区，她在2019年1月成为《纽约时报》的一篇重要报道的主角。她过着一段艰难的生活，因为她26岁时结婚，婚后几周发现丈夫患上了胰腺癌，三个月后去世，她成了26岁的寡妇。一年后，她从曼哈顿的工作地回家到长岛的皇后区，在车上遇到一名男子起身开枪射击，她是那起长岛铁路大屠杀中六名遇难者之一。

艾米有一个非常亲密的家庭，报道还展示了这个家庭在悲剧面前的非凡反应。家人首先决定捐赠艾米的器官给三个人，挽救了他们的生命。一位器官捐献专家指出，这个家庭如此特别，因为通常在危机时刻、悲剧和悲伤中能够捐赠器官的家庭，在看到接受器官的人时往往难以承受，他们不想与这些人建立关系，甚至不想见到他们。然而，这个家庭却主动联系了这些受捐者，并将他们纳入自己的生活中，现在成了非常好的朋友。

你知道，《纽约时报》的真正故事在于：这些人是从哪里获得这种自制力的？《纽约时报》报道中说得很清楚，相反地，许多其他涉事的人都变得愤世嫉俗，但这个家庭选择了宽恕。他们是重生基督徒，对那位先生说话温和。Ferguson。

他们为那个人祈祷了很久，人们说。他们的态度让其他人感到非常惊讶，其中一位器官接受者曾说过，我永远无法如此宽恕。有趣的是，这个家庭将死亡的执行者背后的死亡视作目标，将邪恶行为者的背后之恶视作目标，并将自己的愤怒倾泻在死亡和恶上，而不是针对那个邪恶的人。因此，他们的愤怒没有控制他们，也没有让他们被过去囚禁，而是用来做了许多伟大的事情。

两个不同的家庭：一个是圣经中的，另一个就在纽约这里。这其中的秘密是什么呢？你如何确保自己的愤怒不会将自己囚禁并控制自己？又该如何让自己掌控它呢？

希伯来书的作者给了我们一些原则，我只简单提一下。首先，它告诉我们什么是愤怒；其次，它给出了处理愤怒的三种方法。让我们看看这些内容吧。虽然时间有限，但我们至少可以列出它们。

首先，什么是愤怒。你知道它对愤怒做了什么说明吗？经文说以扫淫乱无神，心中怀着苦毒。现在，“淫乱”可能是一个不准确的翻译，更准确的可能是“背道”，但有趣的是，他被描述为“无神”。

这个翻译也不太好。这个词实际上是指世俗，即专注于眼前的事物的人。让我用一种非常直接的方式来说，我们可以说愤怒总是与你关注的东西相关联。但我将用一个更加直接的方式来表达它，这样更能引起你的注意。

愤怒总是源于爱。愤怒是你被激发起来，并调动所有力量来捍卫你最终所爱之物的情感反应。你对某事物的热爱程度决定了你会有多愤怒。愤怒是对那些威胁到你所爱之物的防卫。

你的爱的层次结构就是你的愤怒的层次结构。你不爱的东西在受到威胁时不会让你生气。事物你爱得少，当受到威胁时会有点生气；你爱得多，当受到威胁时就会非常生气。你有多爱，就有多生气，而当你所爱的事物受到威胁时，你就很生气。

这就是愤怒的本质。这一点很重要，也很尴尬。当我们看到巨大的不公时会有一点生气，但当我们的小计划被完全打乱时却会怒不可遏。当上帝发怒并且他对罪持续不断地愤怒时，为什么呢？

因为他热爱正义和美好，并且他爱他的创造物，而罪正在摧毁这一切。当他发怒的时候，是因为他热爱自己的肚皮、权力和现在。你看，我们这样告诉你，突然间就变得很尴尬，也很有说服力。这显示出两件快速的事情：当你意识到愤怒是保护你所爱之物的一种方式时，你会发现你最生气的，就是你真正热爱的东西。

你最怒不可遏的，最生气的，以及一点点生气的，和不生气的，这些都会告诉你你分别爱得多、少或没有。我说它很有说服力的原因在于，它告诉我们两件事。首先，这表明在圣经中愤怒本身并不是一种罪。不是的，上帝会发怒，耶稣也会发怒，他们是完美的。

事实上，在诗篇4章和以弗所书4章中，我们被告知基督徒应该生气，但不要犯罪，要生气。你知道吗？圣经中有至少两个地方明确告诉基督徒要生气。为什么呢？

如果你对任何事情都不生气，那就意味着你什么都不爱。实际上，圣经说在许多情况下不生气是一种罪，因为它反映了你缺乏爱心。有很多人会说：“我是基督徒，我从不生气。” > 如果你不为任何事生气，那说明你什么也不爱。

那是一种东方的或异教徒的禁欲主义，不是基督教。你绝不会在《圣经》中看到这样的愤怒。斯多葛学派，比如马可·奥勒留，甚至很多东方宗教都说，如果你想拥有权力和控制力，如果你想成为一个坚强的人，不要让任何事情影响到你，永远不要让他们看出你的脆弱，永远不要让他们看到你的真实情感。你知道那是什么吗？

是的，这确实赋予了你力量，但它扼杀了人性。《圣经》说：“如果你从不生气，那就意味着你已经让自己对除了什么之外的一切都无动于衷？自我控制。” 突然间，最重要的是我永远不会受到影响，唯一值得爱的就是我的平衡感，所以你从不生气。

## 愤怒何时出错 / When Anger Goes Wrong

Be angry. It's a sin if you're never angry, but it also tells us how anger goes wrong. Here's how it goes wrong.

When the things that are most important in your life also happen to be most important in reality, then when you get angry, because the right is being trampled on, because the image of God and people is being trampled on. When you see people being cruelly used and you know about their dignity as people in the image of God, when you see human dignity being trampled on, when you see injustice being done, justice being trampled on, when you see truth being trampled on, when you see the name of God being trampled on, those things are the most important things in the universe and when the most important things in the universe, also the most important things in your heart, when you get angry at them, you'll find that your anger does not control you. You control it.

It's useful. It works. It helps.

It pushes you toward doing things that you want to do. It helps you focus. But if the things that you love ultimately are not ultimately important, you'll find that your anger is a way of getting you to serve those false, ultimate loves.

Anger is always a way that the things you love most, chain you into their service. And let me, let me, this takes us back to the theme that we saw in the beginning. You know, we've been doing this theme on, on, on, on sin, all during, lent, all during actually the winter.

And we laid this principle down before and we lay it down one more time. Don't you see how it works? We said, sin is something that leads us to make things more important than God.

Sin is what leads your heart to say, if I was married, things would really be happy. If I had children or if I was successful or if these people accepted me or if I had money or if I had a professional acclaim, all of us have things that we elevate up ahead of God. And we say, if I have that, I'll be happy.

And we've talked about that. But now you see, that's what makes anger, what it is. When any of those things are threatened, your anger rises up and you're chained to that thing.

You can't stop. You're out of control. It's imprisoned you.

When something gets between you and this thing that you say, I've got to have to be happy, that's when the anger comes up and that kind of anger will work evil. That kind of anger will imprison. That kind of anger will control you instead of you controlling it.

That anger will use you instead of you using it. That anger will do you instead of you doing it. That anger will spend you instead of you spending it.

Okay. So how do you handle anger? So that you spend it instead of it spending you.

How do you handle anger? Well, there's three things that are laid down here in this passage of Hebrews. Three things you got to do.

Three principles. All right. The first one is fairly simple, but important.

You need to be aware of the anger in your life. That may seem pretty obvious, but what the metaphor is here, it calls bitterness a root. Now why does it call it a root?

It calls it a root because roots are invisible. This is what ordinarily happens to us. We don't want to believe we're angry people.

You know, when somebody makes us extremely angry, we hate to admit how important that thing is to us. Anger is a way, you know, your slip is showing when anger comes up. You know, when you know that somebody's hurt your reputation and you get furious, you don't want people to know how important your reputation is to you.

When something goes wrong at work and you get furious, you don't want people to know how important that project was to you don't want people to know. In fact, you don't want to believe it yourself. And so what we do is we just get rid of it.

We just stuff it. We say, I'm not angry. There's a part of our heart that says, I want to get that person, but we say, no, no.

I've forgiven them. It's a way for you to feel in control of your life. But what happens is the roots there.

And you will find that that root will defile you, it says, it will grow up eventually. It'll distort your life unless you're willing to see that you really do have anger. People walk around all the time saying, I'm not an angry person.

I'm not an angry person. I'm not angry person. Suddenly, the right opportunity, a root may be down there and the whole tree is in there.

The whole tree, but it's little cold or there's not, there's not enough rain. But the right opportunity comes along the right conditions and suddenly up comes the tree. You say to yourself, I'm not angry.

I'm not angry. I'm not angry. Suddenly, a trapdoor opens and as far as it comes out.

I'm not angry. I'm not angry. Suddenly, you see it's distorting your life.

Some of you are cynical people. Don't you know what that is? That's bitterness.

You've been hurt by somebody, and you're going to pay the world back by not trusting anyone again. That's bitterness. Some people say to me, I'm never going to be a Christian because I've seen such hypocrites.

In other words, your bitterness toward people who have wronged you and disillusioned you, that's now distorting. It's defiling you. I've had people say, I met a guy once who hated Japanese.

这是一件非常错误的事情。基督徒不是从不生气的。如果你从未生气过，那表明你并不真正关心那些你应该关心的事物。我们无处不在地看到破碎、战争、残忍和痛苦。

我们在周围的世界和自己的生活中都能感受到这一切。事情怎么会变成这样？又该如何解决呢？在本月即将出版的新书中，《世界出了什么问题？

》 蒂姆·凯勒给出了清晰而充满同情的答案。他从在复兴堂的一系列讲道中汲取灵感，展示了罪恶的现实如何解释我们周围所见的一切痛苦，并且只有福音才能提供持久的自由和治愈。无论你是否被这个世界的状态压垮，是否挣扎于自己的错误或选择，还是在寻找希望与喜悦，《世界出了什么问题？》都能帮助你看清福音如何回应这个世界的伤痛以及内心的痛苦。

这本新发布的书籍《世界出了什么问题？》是我们本月感谢您的礼物，以帮助福音和生活分享耶稣的好消息。请访问gospelandlife.com/slash-give预订您的副本。这是gospelandlife.com/slash-give。

现在，请听蒂姆·凯勒博士继续今天的教导： 生气是罪恶，如果你从不生气，这同样告诉我们愤怒是如何出错的。这里就是它出错的方式： 当生活中最重要的事情也是现实中最重要的事情时，当你愤怒的时候，是因为正义被践踏了，因为上帝的形象和人的尊严受到了伤害。当你看到人们受到残酷对待，你知道他们作为上帝形象中的人的尊严，当你看到人类尊严被践踏，正义被践踏，真理被践踏，上帝的名字被践踏，这些就是宇宙中最重要、你内心最看重的事情。当宇宙中最重要、你内心也认为最重要的事情受到伤害时，你的愤怒不会控制你，而是你掌控着它。

这很有用，很有效，能帮助你。但如果你所爱的事物最终并不是最重要的，你会发现你的愤怒会引导你去服侍那些虚假的终极之爱。愤怒总是让你最爱的东西将你束缚在它们的服务中。让我再强调一下，这让我们回到了最初的主题上。

我们一直在讨论罪的问题，在整个大斋期，甚至在整个冬季期间，我们都探讨了这个主题。我们之前已经说过，并且再次重申：你看出来它怎么运作了吗？我们说，罪就是引导我们把一些事情看得比上帝更重要。罪使你的心灵认为，如果我结婚了，一切都会幸福；如果有孩子、成功了、被这些人接受、有了钱、或者得到了专业认可，所有这些我们都可能将它们置于上帝之上，并且认为，拥有这些我就快乐。

但你现在看到的是，这就是愤怒的本质所在。当任何这些事物受到威胁时，你的愤怒就会升起，你就会被束缚在那件事上，无法自拔。你失去了控制，它已经囚禁了你。> 用 > 标记的引文保持不变。

当有东西阻碍你实现你说要达到的目标时，愤怒就会浮现。这种愤怒会带来邪恶，会囚禁你，会让你失去控制。它会让你被愤怒操控，而不是你掌控愤怒；它会让你成为愤怒的工具，而不是你利用它；它会让你耗尽自己，而不是你利用它的力量。那么，我们该如何处理愤怒呢？

如何不让愤怒消耗自己而是让它为自己所用？根据希伯来书这段经文，有三个原则需要遵守。这三个步骤很重要： 首先，你需要意识到生活中的愤怒。这听起来可能很显而易见，但这里的比喻把苦毒比作根。

为什么把它称为根呢？因为根是看不见的。通常情况下，我们不愿意承认自己是个容易生气的人。比如，当有人让我们非常生气时，我们会讨厌承认那件事对我们有多重要。

愤怒就像一种暴露你内心想法的方式——当你知道某人伤害了你的名誉而你变得非常愤怒时，你会不想让别人知道这对你有多重要；工作出了问题让你气愤时，你也同样不愿意让人知道那个项目对你有多重要。事实上，我们甚至都不愿意承认这一点。所以我们会把这种情绪压抑下去，说：“我不是生气的。”内心的一部分可能想报复那个人，但我们却会说：“不，我已经原谅他们了。

” 这是一种让自己感觉掌控生活的手段，但结果是这些根仍然存在，并且最终会污染你、扭曲你的生活，除非你能承认自己确实有愤怒的情绪。人们常常说自己不是容易生气的人。突然间，某个契机出现时，那些隐藏的根就会浮现出来，整个树干也会随之显现。整棵树，但天气有点冷或不下雨。

但是时机成熟了，条件具备了，树就突然长出来了。你对自己说，我并不生气。我不生气。我不生气。

忽然间，一个陷阱门开了，它就这样出来了。我不生气。我不生气。忽然间，你发现它正在扭曲你的生活。

你们中有些人是愤世嫉俗的人。你知道那是什么吗？那就是怨恨。有人伤害了你，你决定再也不相信任何人来报复这个世界。

这就是怨恨。有人对我说，我永远也不会成为基督徒，因为我见过伪君子。换句话说，你对那些伤害过你、让你失望的人的怨恨，现在正在扭曲你。它在污染你。

有些人告诉我，我曾经遇到一个讨厌日本人的男人。他在二战期间被关押在一个战俘营里，现在他仍然憎恨日本人。你知道吗？他现在比那时更是在监狱里了。

## 苦毒的牢笼 / The Prison of Bitterness

He was in a prisoner of war camp years ago during World War II, and he hates the Japanese now. You know what? He's more in prison now than he was then.

The only way that a person who is wronged you can really keep controlling you is if you stay mad at them. If you stay mad at somebody, that bitterness is defiling you. It's controlling you.

It's controlling your behavior right now. They've won. Evil has won.

You're defiled. What are you going to do about it? First of all, be aware of it.

Be aware. I have people who say to me, well now I don't want that person harmed. You sure?

Usually what people mean is, I've forgiven that means I'm not going to try to hurt them, but would you like to hear somebody else doing it? Would you love to hear that somebody else did it? Would you love to hear that they've been hurt?

That they've been brought down? You say, well of course I would. That's a root.

The second principle is this. The first principle is you've got to be aware. You've got to be willing to admit that it's there.

You've got to be willing to admit it. You've got to be willing to see it. Second principle is very important.

Second principle is you've got to be willing, I guess, to instead of being godless, be godful. What does that mean? Ask yourself.

Ask yourself. When you find yourself really getting angry, say, what am I defending? Under the Holy Spirit, your anger will probably not be able to hold up to that question if you're willing to go underneath.

What am I defending? You know, I love to be productive. And if my days of preparation, appearing sermons and things like that are interrupted, I can get pretty angry.

And I have to ask myself, what am I defending? Well, I say, I just want to be productive. But look at what's going on there.

I have to say to myself, if you get your goals today, if you get everything done that you want to get done in some deep recess of the heart, you're going to say, I'm an able person. I deserve to be senior pastor of a church. And if I don't get it done, I'll say, I am nothing.

I am inadequate. I am unable. And if somebody comes between me and my goal, I get furious.

I have to say, what am I defending? God came to Baruch back in Jeremiah 45. And he says to Baruch, Baruch was pretty upset.

He wanted his wonderful career as a scholar and a scribe. But because he got linked up with Jeremiah, who completely crossed the establishment and everybody was against Jeremiah. So everybody was against Baruch and Baruch's career was going down the toilet.

And he was discouraged in angry. And God comes to Baruch and he says, seek a style, great things for thyself. Seek them not.

He says, Baruch, if you make your career more important than me, you're always going to be angry. And that's the reason you're an angry person. Make me your success.

And you'll be free. Make me your success. Don't you see?

Seek a style, great things for thyself. Seek them not. When you get angry, ask yourself, what am I defending?

What is it? How am I being secular? How am I focusing on the immediate?

How are penultimate things become ultimate to me? I will not be controlled by these things. I will not seek these things.

These things will imprison me with through anger. I will not. I will not.

I will not. Well, last of all. So the first principle is you have to be aware of the roots in your life.

Secondly, you've got to be willing to be God full. That means you've got to not just say, I shouldn't be mad. I shouldn't be mad.

I shouldn't be mad. Instead, you got to go underneath and say, why has productivity? Oh, Tim Keller, why has your productivity become so important to you?

只有那些伤害过你的人真正能控制你的方法是让你一直生气。如果你一直生气，怨恨就会污染你。它会控制你。它正在控制你现在的行为。

他们赢了。邪恶赢了。你被污染了。你要怎么办呢？

首先，要意识到这一点。要意识到。有人对我说，好吧，我现在不想那个人受到伤害。真的吗？

通常人们的意思是，我已经原谅了他，意味着我不再试图伤害他，但你会喜欢别人这样做吗？你会希望听到别人这样做吗？你会希望听到他们受到了伤害？你说，当然我希望。

这就是怨恨的根源。第二个原则就是这个。第一个原则是你必须意识到这一点。你必须承认它存在。

你必须承认它。你必须看到它。第二个原则非常重要。第二个原则是，你必须愿意，或许应该变得有神灵意识而不是无神论者。

**这意味着什么？问自己。**自问。当你真的生气时，说：“我在捍卫什么？

”在圣灵的光照下，如果你愿意深入思考，你的怒气很可能无法经受住这个问题的考验。我在捍卫什么呢？你知道，我喜欢高效工作。如果我准备讲道和其他准备工作被打断了，我可能会非常生气。

我必须问自己：如果今天我能完成所有我想做的目标，在内心深处，我会说：“我是有能力的人。我值得成为教会的资深牧师。” 如果我没有完成这些事情，我会说：“我一无是处。” 我不够好。

做不到。如果有人妨碍了我的目标，我会怒不可遏。神曾对巴录说这话，这在《耶利米书》45章中。当时巴录很沮丧。

他希望成为一名学者和书记官，但因为与耶利米联系在一起——耶利米完全颠覆了既定秩序，而所有人都反对耶利米——所以也反对巴录，他的事业开始走下坡路。他感到灰心和愤怒时，神对他说：“去追求你自己的成就吧，但不要为此努力。” 神说：“巴录啊，如果你让你的事业比我还重要，你就会一直生气。这就是你生气的原因。

让我的成功成为你的成就。” 这样你就自由了。让我的成功成为你的成就。你明白吗？

去追求你自己的成就吧，但不要为此努力。当你生气时，问自己：我在捍卫什么？它是什么？我如何变得世俗化？

我如何专注于眼前的事物？最终目标变成了眼前的事务吗？我不受这些事物的控制。我不寻求这些东西。

这些东西会用愤怒将我囚禁。我不。我不。我不。

最后，第一个原则是你必须意识到生活中的根源问题。第二个原则是你要愿意完全归向神。**这意味着你不能只是说：“我不应该生气。**” 我不该生气。

而是要问，为什么生产力对你如此重要？哦，提莫·凯勒，为什么你的生产力对你来说变得这么重要？哦，巴鲁赫，为什么你的事业对你如此重要？你说你不仅仅应该问自己为什么会这样生气，我为什么要生气。

基督徒不应该生气。你需要深入思考。你是如何变得无神论者的？失去控制的愤怒、被愤怒掌控的愤怒、多年扭曲生活的愤怒是一种无神论的表现或虚假的神化表现，要将正确的神放回原位。

## 恩典胜过苦毒 / Grace Overcomes Bitterness

Oh, Baruch, why has your career become so important to you? You say it's not enough just to say, why am I so angry? I shouldn't be angry.

Christians don't get angry. You've got to go underneath. How are you being godless?

Anger that's out of control, anger that has got you under its control, anger that's distorting your life over the years is a form of godlessness or a form of you might say false godfulness, put the right god back very belongs. Last of all, look, it says, let no one miss the grace of God. Let know what?

Let no root of bitterness spring up. See the last principle? Grace and bitterness prevent each other.

They are absolute antithesis to each other. They're like fire and water. When you bring fire and water together, either the fire is greater than the water and it vaporizes the water or the water is greater than the fire and it extinguishes the fire, but they cannot be together.

Either your understanding of grace will put out your bitterness or the bitterness will keep you from understanding grace. They cannot coexist together. Do you know why?

When Jesus Christ was up on the cross, after he had paid the price for our sins, he said to tell us, I mean, he says, it's translated, it is finished. It is finished, but it can also be translated, it is paid because it's an economic term, but what he's really saying is, I finished the payment. Do you know what he did?

I don't understand much about hell, but I know this. I don't understand a lot about hell, but I know this. Hell is endless.

What does that mean? It means that our debt to God, what we owe God is so great that we never finish its payment. Let's not think about anything else for a minute.

That's not think of all your other questions you might have about hell, but just realize hell is eternal. What that is saying is your payment is never finished and yet when Jesus Christ died on the cross for us, he finished the payment. That must mean that whatever he experienced in the cross was far worse than what you and I could experience in hell forever.

The only way and the perfect way and the absolute way for you to deal with what people owe you, how do you forgive people? How do you say they owe me? I forgive.

They owe me, but I let it go. They owe me, but I will not demand payment. You have to let what you owe God absolutely beggar, absolutely overwhelmed what they owe you in your mind.

You've got to say, look what he paid. He did not demand for me what I owed. It is finished.

Here's the weird thing. If you demand payment from people, if you stick pins in their heart, or if you just stick pins in them in your mind, in your heart, if you avoid them, or if you can try to control them saying, you owe me. If you give little digs to them, if you give little digs to other people, if you say, I've forgiven you, but it's really your way of rubbing their nose in it by your righteous mercy showing you how much of a better person you are.

There's hundreds of ways of making them pay. Jesus did not make you pay. If you try to make other people pay, it will never be finished.

They will get more and more poor, and you will get more and more poor. But if you see Jesus saying it's finished, it's paid, then you can turn to other people and say, it's finished. I will not make you pay.

He did not make me pay. You have to see Jesus dying like that. And if you do, it'll be over.

It'll be finished. You'll be able to say, as he forgave me, I forgive them. Can you do that?

You know, the great irony of the whole thing is being a better person is to say to people, you owe me. My parents, they owe me. My children, they owe me.

This institution owes me. These people owe me. They owe me.

Here's what's so ironic. If you hold onto their accounts, if you, instead of tearing them up, if you hold onto those accounts, what's so ironic about it, the Bible says you will get poor and poor and poor. Look at Jesus Christ.

When he paid your accounts, instead of demanding payment, does he look poor to you? He's rich. He came down, right?

He emptied himself. He paid the price. Therefore, God has highly exalted him.

The great irony. If you demand payment, you'll get poor and poor. If you make the payment, you'll finally get rich.

You'll finally be free. You'll finally find the same freedom that that family found that even the New York Times couldn't help but notice. And other people will notice it in use as well.

最后，它说：“不要人错失上帝的恩典。”你知道是什么意思吗？不要让根深蒂固的苦毒滋生。看看最后一个原则？

恩典和苦毒是绝对对立的。它们就像火与水一样。当你把火和水放在一起时，要么火势大于水量，蒸发掉所有的水；要么水量大于火焰，熄灭火焰，但它们不能共存。你的理解是否消除了你的苦毒，或者你对苦毒的理解阻止了你接受恩典？

它们无法共存。你知道为什么吗？当耶稣基督在十字架上时，在他为我们的罪付出代价之后，他说：“成了。” 这句话也可以翻译成“已经付清”——因为这是一个经济术语。

但他真正想表达的是：我已经完成了支付。你知道他做了什么吗？我不太了解地狱，但我知道一件事。我不太了解地狱，但我知道一件事。

地狱是永恒的。**这意味着我们欠上帝的债务如此巨大，以至于我们永远无法还清。**让我们暂时不要考虑其他关于地狱的问题。不要去想你对地狱的所有疑问，但要意识到地狱是永恒的。

**这意味着你的债务永远不会还清，然而当耶稣基督为我们死在十字架上时，他完成了支付。**这必须意味着他在十字架上的经历比你和我永远在地狱中所能经历的都要糟糕得多。唯一、完美且绝对的方法来处理别人欠你的人，你如何原谅他人？你怎么说他们欠了我？

我饶恕。他们欠我，但我选择放下。他们欠我，但我不再索要偿还。你必须在心里让上帝所欠你的完全破产，彻底压倒你在心中的债。

你得说：“看看他付出了什么。他没有要求我偿还我所欠的。这就完了。” 奇怪的是，如果你向别人索要赔偿，如果在他们心中扎针，或者只是在你的心中和思想上扎针，避免与他们见面，试图控制他们说“你欠了我”，甚至对他们进行小小的攻击，你对其他人也是如此，你说“我已经饶恕了你”，但其实这只是通过你的公义来让他们知道你是多么的优秀。

有很多方式让别人偿还。耶稣没有让你偿还。如果你尝试让他人偿还，这永远不会结束。他们会越来越贫穷，你也越来越贫穷。

但如果你能看到耶稣说“这就完了”，“已经付清”了，然后你可以转向其他人说：“这就完了。”我不会要求你偿还。他没有让我偿还。你必须看到耶稣那样死去的样子。

如果能做到这一点，一切就结束了。这就完了。你可以这样说：“因为他饶恕了我，我也饶恕他们。”你能做到吗？

你知道，这个事情最大的讽刺在于，成为一个更好的人是告诉别人“你欠了我”。我的父母欠了我。我的孩子欠了我。这个机构欠了我。

这些人欠了我。这里最讽刺的是，如果你抓住他们的账单不放，而不是撕毁它们，如果继续保留这些账单，圣经说你会越来越贫穷。看看耶稣基督。当他付清你的账单时，他没有要求偿还，这让你觉得他很穷吗？

他是富有的。他下来了，不是吗？他空虚自己，付出了代价。因此，神大大地尊荣了他。

最大的讽刺在于，如果你索要赔偿，你会越来越贫穷；如果你支付赔偿，最终会变得富有。你终于会获得自由。你会找到与那个家庭一样的自由，即使《纽约时报》也忍不住注意到了。人们也会在使用中注意到这一点。

为自己寻求这些美好的事吧。不要自己去寻找它们。我们来祷告。当你这样做的时候，你也将会收到免费的文章、讲道、灵修材料和其他许多以福音为中心的资源。
