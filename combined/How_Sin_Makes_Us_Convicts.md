## 引言与经文诵读 / Introduction and Scripture Reading

Welcome to Gospel in Life. Why is the world so broken? And why are we capable of inflicting such harm even toward those we love?

People point to politics, poverty, or psychology, but none of these fully explain what we see in ourselves and in history. This month on the podcast, Tim Keller is teaching from a series exploring the question, what's wrong with us? Knowing us how the Bible's teaching on sin offers the only explanation deep enough to face the truth in all its complexity, and the only hope powerfully enough to transform us.

Isaiah 64, verses 1 to 9, and then it skips on down near the latter part of this long passage, Isaiah 65, 17 to 18. So read 1 to 9, and 17 to 18. Oh, that you would rent the heavens and come down, that the mountains would tremble before you, as when the fire sets twigs of blaze and causes water to boil, come down to make your name known to your enemies, and cause the nations to quake before you.

For when you did awesome things that we did not expect, you came down and the mountains trembled before you, since ancient times no one has heard, no eye has perceived, no one has heard, no ear has perceived, no eye has seen any God besides you, who acts on behalf of those who wait for him. You come to the help of those who gladly do right, who remember your ways, but when we continue to sin against them, you were angry. How then can we be saved?

All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags. We all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away, no one calls on your name, or strives to lay hold of you, for you have hidden your face from us, and made us waste away because of our sins. Yet, O Lord, you are our Father, we are the clay, you are the potter, we are all the work of your hand, do not be angry beyond measure, O Lord, do not remember our sins forever, oh, look upon us, we pray, for we are all your people.

Behold, I will create new heavens, and a new earth. The former things will not be remembered, nor will they come to mind, but be glad and rejoice forever in what I will create, for God will create Jerusalem to be a delight, and it is people to be a joy, this is God's word. Now, what we are doing is we are looking in a series on what the Bible says about sin, and we have been digging into the Hebrew Bible in particular, and actually into Isaiah in particular, and tonight, we come to the most unpopular part of what the Bible teaches about sin, and what I am about to tell you, what I am about to tell you, and I have asked the ushers to borrow the doors, so that you stay for at least the first point, after hearing the very, very galling and unpalatable introduction to the sermon.

What this is teaching is that God is an angry God. God gets angry, look, verse 5, you are angry at us, verse 9, don't be angry at us. The Bible is presenting to us a God who gets angry at sin.

Now, need I say, this isn't one of his, you know, his poles aren't very high on this attribute. One of the ways that you can see this is that in the, in the, if you want to school in the United States, somewhere in middle school or maybe junior high school, very possible that you came across when you were studying U. S.

colonial history, and you were looking at the life in the early 18th century, mid 18th century, you may have come across an excerpt from a sermon, which is one of the more famous sermons ever preached here, preached back in 1741 by Jonathan Edwards, and it's called, sinners in the hands of an angry God. You might have had some little excerpts, you know, very often in your, you know, your little history or eighth grade history book or whatever, there's a little bar over here and then it has some excerpts from sinners in the hands of an angry God, and you raise your hand and you say, teacher, did they people really believe that back then? And the, just the discussion goes something like this, well, you know, it used to be that most people in this country did believe in an angry God who punished people.

But today, more and more, we believe in a loving and good God who's more accepting of people. And that's the gist of it. I don't know.

I was there. I mean, I had that in eighth grade, ninth grade. But here's what I'm going to say, the biblical and three God, the angry God that's presented to us by the Bible.

Yeah, we have lost, but yet we have lost connection with it in our society and our culture. And I'm here to tell you, it's a bad thing. In fact, I'll go this far.

You need an angry God. You need in your mind and in your heart a God that gets angry at sin. You need an angry God to live with hope.

You need an angry God to live with humility and you need an angry God to know how loved you are. And if you don't believe in an angry God, a really angry God who hates sin and is going to punish it, you're impoverishing yourself. You're taking away all sorts of hope and humility and love.

That's what I'm here to tell you. And you know, you say, how does that work out? Well, okay, let's go.

欢迎来到"生命中的福音"。为什么这个世界如此破碎?为什么我们甚至能够对我们所爱的人造成如此大的伤害?

人们会指向政治、贫困或心理学,但这些都无法完全解释我们在自己身上和历史中所看到的现象。本月在播客中,提摩太·凯勒将教导一个系列,探讨这个问题:我们到底出了什么问题?让我们知道圣经关于罪的教导如何提供了唯一足够深刻的解释来面对其全部复杂性的真相,以及唯一足够强大的盼望来改变我们。

以赛亚书64章1到9节,然后跳到这段长篇经文的后半部分,以赛亚书65章17到18节。所以读1到9节,和17到18节。愿你裂天而降,愿山岭在你面前震动,好像火烧干柴,又像火将水烧开,使你敌人知道你的名,使列国在你面前发颤。

你曾行我们不能逆料可畏的事,那时你降临,山岭在你面前震动。从古以来,人未曾听见、未曾耳闻、未曾眼见,在你以外有什么神为等候他的人行事。你迎接那欢喜行义、记念你道的人。但我们仍犯罪,你就发怒。我们怎能得救呢?

我们都像不洁净的人,所有的义都像污秽的衣服。我们都像叶子渐渐枯干,我们的罪孽好像风把我们吹去。没有人求告你的名,没有人奋力抓住你,因为你掩面不顾我们,使我们因罪孽消化。然而,耶和华啊,你是我们的父。我们是泥,你是窑匠,我们都是你手的工作。耶和华啊,求你不要大发震怒,也不要永远记念罪孽。哦,求你垂顾我们,我们都是你的百姓。

看哪,我造新天新地。从前的事不再被记念,也不再追想。你们当因我所造的永远欢喜快乐,因我造耶路撒冷为人所喜,造其中的居民为人所乐。这是神的话语。现在,我们正在做的是查看圣经关于罪的系列教导,我们一直在深入研读希伯来圣经,特别是以赛亚书,今晚,我们来到圣经关于罪的教导中最不受欢迎的部分,我要告诉你们的,我已经请引座员把门锁上,这样你们至少能听完第一点,在听到这个非常、非常令人恼怒和难以接受的讲道引言之后。

这段经文教导我们的是,神是一位发怒的神。神会发怒,看,第5节,你向我们发怒,第9节,不要向我们发怒。圣经向我们呈现的是一位对罪发怒的神。

现在,需要我说吗,这不是他最受欢迎的属性之一。你可以看到这一点的一个方式是,在美国上学时,大概在初中或者初高中,很可能你在学习美国殖民地历史时,研究18世纪早期、中期的生活时,可能会遇到一篇讲道的节选,这是这里讲过的最著名的讲道之一,是1741年由乔纳森·爱德华兹讲的,题目叫"落在愤怒之神手中的罪人"。你可能看过一些小节选,你知道,通常在你的八年级历史书或其他什么书里,旁边有个小栏目,然后有一些"落在愤怒之神手中的罪人"的节选,你举手说,老师,那时候的人真的相信这个吗?然后,讨论大概是这样的,嗯,你知道,过去这个国家的大多数人确实相信一位发怒的神会惩罚人。

但今天,我们越来越多地相信一位有爱的、良善的、更能接纳人的神。这就是要点。我不知道。

我是经历过的。我是说,我在八年级、九年级时就遇到过这个。但我要说的是,圣经向我们呈现的发怒的神。

是的,我们已经失去了,但我们已经失去了与它在我们社会和文化中的联系。我在这里告诉你们,这是件坏事。事实上,我要这么说。

你需要一位发怒的神。你需要在你的思想和心中有一位对罪发怒的神。你需要一位发怒的神才能带着盼望活着。

你需要一位发怒的神才能带着谦卑活着,你需要一位发怒的神才能知道你有多被爱。如果你不相信一位发怒的神,一位真正发怒的、憎恨罪并要惩罚它的神,你就是在使自己贫乏。你正在夺走各种盼望、谦卑和爱。

这就是我要告诉你们的。你知道,你说,这怎么可能呢?好吧,让我们开始吧。

## 为什么你需要一位发怒的神才能有盼望 / Why You Need an Angry God for Hope

First of all, and basically you just work right through the text on this. First of all, verses one to three tell us that you need an angry God, the biblical angry God, to live in hope. To be able to live in hope in a broken world.

One of the things that's easy to miss when you studies these books like Aziz, in fact, big parts of the Old Testament, is that they have a historical situation. They were not just written as essays. They weren't lectures.

They were written into a historical situation. And everybody agrees that Isaiah chapter 40 and following after chapter 40 was written to a nation to Israel that was facing exile, that was facing tremendous injustice, that was going to face or did face or had faced when they read this. Their capital city drew some torn down.

Their own children slaughtered. Go read about it in Psalm 137. Their infants, their little heads of their infant stashed against the rock by the victors.

Captivity, chains, terrible injustice. And so what are they doing? Well, we see in verses one to three, they're asking God to come down and judge the injustice.

They're saying, oh, well, you would run the heavens and come down. The mountains would tremble before you. As when fire sets, twigs of blaze come down to make your name known to your enemies and cause the nations to quake.

And what they're really saying is, if you came down with all your justice and you went after the oppressors and you went after the perpetrators of injustice, they would be like dust before you. They would crumble. They would be like burning twigs that the wind drives away.

And so they're saying, of course, this is what verses one to three sang. How in the world could you possibly live in a world filled with injustice with any hope at all, unless you believed in a and angry God? God gets angry in injustice.

And so here's the first point. First point is the God's anger in the Bible is not like our anger usually is. It's not crankiness.

It's not ill temper. It's not ego. It's not it's not explosion.

It's not out of control. It's a settled, fixed, implacable, irrevocable, incorruptible, opposition to injustice and evil. So that, no debt will go unpaid.

Every account will be squared and nobody will get away with anything. And that's what the Bible means when it says there's an angry God. That's the kind of God that we have.

That's what the Bible presents. Now right away, objection. I know.

Right away, people immediately put up their hands and say, wait a minute. One of the problems with that, one of the reasons why many people, most people in New York City certainly believe that that's a primitive idea is they say, you know what? This idea of a God of vengeance.

Oh my, it's primitive. We've got to get beyond that because we need to work for a peaceful world. This idea of a vengeful God who bears the sword.

Oh my work. That leads to intolerance and eventually the violence. What you really need is you need to believe in an accepting God if you're going to believe in a God.

You have to believe that sin is in the eye of the beholder. You have to believe that sin is sort of a matter of perspective. This idea of a God of vengeance.

That's going to lead to nothing but violence. Nothing but intolerance and violence.

---

首先,基本上就是按照经文来讲。首先,第1到3节告诉我们,你需要一位发怒的神,圣经中的发怒的神,才能带着盼望活着。才能在一个破碎的世界中带着盼望活着。

当你研究像以赛亚这样的书,事实上,旧约的大部分内容时,有一点很容易被忽略,那就是它们都有一个历史背景。它们不只是作为论文写的。它们不是讲座。

它们是写给一个历史处境的。大家都同意,以赛亚书40章及以后的章节是写给一个面临被掳的国家、以色列的,他们面临着巨大的不公义,他们将要面对,或确实面对,或当他们读到这个时已经面对过。他们的首都被摧毁。

他们自己的孩子被屠杀。去读诗篇137篇。他们的婴儿,他们婴儿的小脑袋被胜利者摔在石头上。

被掳、锁链、可怕的不公义。那么他们在做什么呢?嗯,我们在第1到3节看到,他们在求神降临审判这不公义。

他们在说,哦,愿你裂天而降。山岭会在你面前震动。就像火点燃树枝,降临使你的敌人知道你的名,使列国震颤。

他们真正在说的是,如果你带着你所有的公义降临,你去对付那些压迫者,你去对付那些制造不公义的人,他们在你面前就会像尘土一样。他们会崩溃。他们会像被风吹走的燃烧的树枝。

所以他们在说,当然,这就是第1到3节所说的。在一个充满不公义的世界里,你怎么可能带着任何盼望活着,除非你相信一位发怒的神?神对不公义发怒。

所以这是第一点。第一点是,圣经中神的愤怒不像我们的愤怒通常那样。它不是暴躁。

它不是坏脾气。它不是自我。它不是爆发。

它不是失控。它是一种坚定的、固定的、不可改变的、不可撤销的、不可腐蚀的对不公义和邪恶的反对。所以,没有一笔债会不被偿还。

每一笔账都会被清算,没有人会逃脱。这就是圣经说有一位发怒的神时的意思。这就是我们所拥有的神的类型。

这就是圣经所呈现的。现在马上就会有反对意见。我知道。

马上,人们立即举手说,等一下。这个问题之一,许多人,当然纽约市的大多数人认为这是一个原始的想法的原因之一是,他们说,你知道吗?这种复仇之神的想法。

哦天哪,这是原始的。我们必须超越这个,因为我们需要为一个和平的世界而努力。这种持剑的复仇之神的想法。

哦天哪。这会导致不宽容,最终导致暴力。你真正需要的是,如果你要相信一位神,你需要相信一位接纳的神。

你必须相信罪是见仁见智的。你必须相信罪在某种程度上是一个观点问题。这种复仇之神的想法。

那只会导致暴力。只会导致不宽容和暴力。

## 非暴力需要神圣的复仇 / Nonviolence Requires Divine Vengeance

Well recently I read a book that is one of the most powerful refutations of that extremely common belief that we have to get beyond a God of vengeance if we're going to have a world of peace.

Incredible book actually. In many ways, it's a book by written by Miroslav Wolf, whose Croatian and the name of the book is exclusion and embrace. And let me read you his thesis.

He says in this book, because his Croatian, he was raised in the former Yugoslavia, he has seen all the stuff the people who this passage was written to, who are crying out for vengeance and crying out because of the injustice. He's seen all that. He's been through that.

And this is what he says. The practice of nonviolence requires a belief in divine vengeance. I'll say that again because it just, I mean, if nobody's eyebrows are raised, you're not listening.

The practice of, there we go, that's better. The practice of nonviolence requires a belief in divine vengeance. He says, the only way to nonviolence is to believe in a God who gets angry at injustice.

Without an angry God, you'll never get out. You'll never get into nonviolence. You'll be stuck in the cycle of violence.

Now, how does he make that point? Well, here it is. Here's the quote.

And he says, my thesis that the practice of nonviolence requires a belief in divine vengeance will be unpopular with many Christians, especially in the West. But to the person inclined to dismiss it, please imagine something. Imagine you're delivering a lecture in a war zone where I delivered this chapter as a paper.

And among your listeners are people whose cities and villages have first been plundered, then burned, and then leveled to the ground, whose daughters and sisters have been raped, and whose fathers and brothers have had their throat slit. Now, the topic of your lecture is a Christian attitude toward violence, and the thesis is we should not retaliate and be sucked into the cycle of continued violence. We should not pay back.

Why not? And here's what he says, violence thrives today, secretly nourished by the belief that God refuses to take the sword. And then he says, if you do this, if you lecture like this, soon you will discover that it takes the quiet of a suburb for the birth of the thesis.

The human nonviolence is the result of a God who refuses to judge. And a scorch man soaked in the blood of innocent, of the innocent, the idea will invariably die like other pleasant captivity of a liberal mind. In a world of violence, it would not be worthy of God not to wield the sword.

If God were not angry at injustice and deception, did not take a final end of violence, that guy would not be worthy of our worship. Now, can I put it in a nutshell? Here's what he's saying.

Anybody who says that a God of vengeance will lead to violence has not actually been a victim of violence themselves. You live in a nice suburban little bubble, or a very, very nice area where you haven't yourself been the victim of injustice. He says, when you're the victim of injustice, you will have to pay back unless you're assured that there is a God of vengeance, that there is a God who hates injustice, that there's a God who's angry with injustice.

And a God who's going to settle every account so that nobody gets away with anything, unless you believe in a God of divine vengeance, you will not be able to resist picking up the sword and being, you know, being the avenger yourself, or else you'll just die at a spare. That's the reason why he's able to come back and say it's the practice of non-violence that absolutely requires a belief in divine vengeance. And so here's our first point.

You know, people say, why do I need an angry God? He says non-violence is impossible without belief in a judge. In fact, let me, let me, let me go, let me press a little further.

If you are, what he calls the victim of one of these liberal piety's, you've always heard of, I believe in a God of justice, that would not lead to peace in the world. That would lead to more violence. He says, you will be absolutely, if anybody ever comes and actually does something bad to you, you will be sucked right into pay back.

Actually, you've been already. He just haven't had, maybe in many cases, you haven't had actually, somebody actually attack you and draw blood or kill you or kill, or kill people in that your family. And anybody tried to do that.

He says, because unless you believe in a God of vengeance, you will not be a peacemaker. You will not be able to live a life of peace in the world. You will not be able to live a life of hope in the world.

In fact, one thing that worries about me, if I look out at it, many of you, many of you do live in that bubble because most of us live in a world far more safe and far more happy and far more secure than most other people who have lived anywhere else in the world or anywhere in any other time in history. And if that bubble should break and you have a nambi-pambi God who does not wreak vengeance on injustice, you will either get sucked into the violence you will have to pay back yourself or else. You'll die in despair.

That's the first thing. You need a God. You need an angry God where you won't be able to live in peace in an unjust world.

Secondly, you need an angry God if you're going to live in humility. Now, here's what's so intriguing. Let's move right on to the next three verses.

All the commentators say it is extremely interesting to see the ironic relationship between the first and second stanza, the first stanza is verses one to three. We just read it. What they're saying is, we are the victims of injustice.

And so we call down into the world the God of judgment. If you would only come down and make the mountains shake, what would happen? Well, the enemies, the wicked people, the enemies, the bad nations, what they would do is they would just, they would be consumed.

They would become dust. They'd become consumed. And they would, the wind would blow them away.

But get this. See, before you, verse two, the nations would quake before you. But now look, verses four, five, and six, here's the great irony.

Who's tripling up now? Who is wasting away? See, who is tripling up like a leaf, verse six?

And like the wind, our sins sweep us away. They are. The very thing they call God down to do is happening to them.

And this is what we were saying. And this is, at this point, by the way, this is an extremely important little test to know whether or not you're understanding the difference between the angry God that maybe you were taught about, or you taught other people, maybe somebody taught you about this as you were growing up, or maybe you were taught other people believed in an angry God. And the angry God of the Bible, when you meet the angry God of the Bible, you will find out and you will come to see what they see.

You'll get out of verses one to three. When you're in one to three, what you're thinking is if God would come down, the bad people would be judged. But in verses four to six, they find out that we deserve as much judgment as anybody else, that we too are under judgment, that we too absolutely deserve punishment as much as those people that we thought were the wicked perpetrators.

That's absolutely critical, and this is one of the great tests to know whether or not you're getting in touch with the biblical God. Let me show you what I mean. There's two kinds of people in the world that seem to be opposites.

There's two kinds of people in the world, those who divide everybody in the world, in the two kinds of people, and those who don't. Did you know that? Well, I meant there's two groups of people that are very prominent.

I wouldn't say there's only two kinds of people here. On the one hand, you've got people we would call religious people, traditionally religious. And they certainly believe that there are absolute standards, and that there are absolute moral values, and that we're going to be judged by them.

And therefore they believe that if God were to come down, He would judge the bad people. And people who are religious, they say, well, I don't cheat on my spouse, and I go to my family, and I obey the Ten Commandments, and I go to church, or synagogue, and I give to the poor, and so on. I'm a good person.

And so you're in versus one to three. You say, if God were to come down, you see, the bad people would be judged, and they feel pretty good about themselves. On the other hand, you've got their nemesis.

I mean, in our society, the nemesis, so that people believe in traditional moral values, are, you might call this secular people, progressive liberal people, and what they say is, you know what? Everybody, sin is in the eye of the beholder. Everybody's got their own way of defining sin.

What sinful for you wouldn't be sinful for me, and what we have to do is we have to embrace them. We have to embrace everybody. We have to tolerate everybody.

We have to accept everybody. And they look very, very tolerant, except they're just as much in versus one and three. Because what they are saying is, yes, you know, what the trouble with this world is, is all those people over there who are in tolerant.

I'm not like them. You see, they're religious people, and they're religious people, are all walking around saying, if only everybody in the world was like me, we wouldn't be in trouble. If only those people over there that are causing the trouble, if somebody would just knock them down.

And so you see, it really doesn't matter whether you're religious or religious, whether you're conservative or liberal, if you live in versus one, two, and three. But what happens to Christians? When they finally get close and to see what God really is like, inevitably, what they say is, verse six, all of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are filthy rags.

Now that is a stunning statement. In fact, you know, when you first read through it, you say, wait, what? He didn't say all our sins are his filthy rags.

Of course, they're filthy rags. All our righteous, and he's not just saying righteousness is just a sort of a general thing, our righteous deeds are filthy rags. What happens is a Christian has begun to look past the externals into his or her own heart.

Start looking at motivations. That's the only way you can possibly say that my righteous deed stinks. I mean, how could a righteous deed stink?

How could doing the right thing stink? How could be a stench in God's nostrils? Well, the answer is the gospel turns you into a kind of Nietzschean person when you look at your own heart.

You begin Nietzsche, of course, was always looking at motives. Nietzsche is almost invented what's called the Hermann Unix's suspicion. Looking inside and saying, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're real good.

You go to church, you do this, you do that. But why? Why do you, you say to everybody, we should love everybody, but why do you say everybody?

What aren't you really trying to do is you're trying to keep people down? Are you trying to be superior? You say, oh, we should obey and should be very moral, but why aren't you really trying to stay in power?

You see, a Christian looks at my your own heart, and here's what the Christian is saying. Christian is somebody who says, I become, I come to realize that the reason for my sins and the reason for my good deeds is the same and it's wrong. I don't, even when I do a bad deed, I'm trying to be my own Lord, but when I do a good deed, I am too.

When I do a bad deed, I'm trying to be my own Savior, but when I do a good deed, I'm trying to be my own Savior. When I do good deeds, I'm really trying to get God to do right by me, and I'm trying to control him. I'm trying to put him in my debt.

I'm trying to, you see, one of the ways you can tell your righteousness is a filthy rag. A lot of you are very righteous. I'm going to thank you to do many good things, but you're always angry because God's not letting your life go right.

Why is that? You know why? He said, I've lived this very good life and my sister-in-law is not living a very good life for my brother, and I know why is my life going so bad?

Whoa, whoa, wait a minute, Nietzsche says, wait a minute. Why were you being good? Trying to get God to do your will.

That's the essence of sin. Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache. We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives.

How did it get this way? And what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing this month, What Is Wrong with the World?

Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer, drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer. Dr. Keller shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us, and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing.

Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes or choices, or looking for hope and joy, What Is Wrong with the World will help you see how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us. This newly released book, What Is Wrong with the World is our thanks for your gift this month to help gospel in life share the good news of Jesus. Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com-slashgive.

That's gospelandlife.com-slash-give. Now here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching.

It's very essence of sin. Everybody does my will. See, you know, you're a life for mine, not my life for yours.

Our wills cross, I get my way, you know? Your righteousness is a filthy rag. Now here's what goes on, unless you believe in a God of judgment and justice and you come into the presence of that God, you're never going to be humbled.

I'll tell you, and it's Christians who understand this who are the most civil people. What do I mean by that? Unless you believe in an angry God, you won't be civil.

How are you going to live in a place like New York City with all these people that are so different? Different beliefs, different races, different cultures, different philosophies, different religions. How are you going to be?

Now, people with traditional religious values have a tremendous, a trouble living in a city. Because they say, I've got the truth. I got the truth.

And therefore, I feel so superior to so many of these other people. You're not going to be good citizens. You're not going to serve them.

You're not going to sit down and treat them as equals. You're just not. But if you say, oh, I passed that, you see, I believe everything is relative.

But what are you going to do? You're going to be so upset with people who believe in absolute values. You're going to, right, you're going to say, I'm so much better than they are.

I hate those kinds of people. But wait a minute. Do you know how many people believe in absolute values in New York City?

Look at all the Muslims. Look at all the Orthodox Jews. See, look at all the, you know, look at all the people of your Protestant who are Catholic, or your Catholic who are Protestant and so forth.

I want you to know that unless you believe that you deserve judgment, you're going to be a lousy neighbor. You're not going to look out next door and say, hey, I deserve as much judgment as any perpetrator in this world. And therefore, I don't look at myself as superior to you.

Unless you have that, you can be a lousy neighbor. You're not going to live civilly. You're also not going to be able to forgive because you're going to put yourself in judgment.

One of the reasons why you have to believe in an angry God who's going to square all accounts is because there's a tremendous burden that some of you are carrying right now. When you look at what other people have done to you, in fact, when you look and see what life is done to you, or even what God has done for you to you, and you get upset because you don't understand why did that happen to me? What you've done is you don't have an angry God.

You're putting yourself in the shoes of a judge. You don't believe in a God who really is going to judge. And that's the reason why you can't forgive.

If you're having trouble forgiving somebody right now, it's because you're stuck in verses one, two or three, one, two, three. You haven't gotten a verses four to six yet. If you're having trouble, in fact, if you're having trouble even understanding why God let this or that happen.

If you're just so upset because God didn't let this happen, God didn't let that happen. This week, I was reminded of something that happened me a long time ago. I had a big impact on my life.

Why am I here tonight? Why is this church here? Because my Presbyterian denomination sent me to New York.

Well, why was I Presbyterian? Well, because I fell in the influence of a particular teacher my last semester and seminary. My last semester in graduate school.

And he just got there barely because, you know, at the very end, but because I fell under his influence, I became a Presbyterian therefore I was sent here and therefore we're here. Hi, so why did that person come to that school? Well, you know, he almost didn't make it, but he was, because he was British and he was having visa problems.

But somebody in the state department knew somebody at the seminary and a person in the seminary pulled some strings and he got there just in time. So that person hadn't pulled those strings. He wouldn't have gotten there.

I wouldn't have come to his influence. I wouldn't have been Presbyterian. I wouldn't be here.

Well, somebody says that's interesting. Why did somebody at the seminary have power the state department? Well, there was a student at the seminary then named Mike Ford whose father was Gerald Ford who was the president of the United States at the time.

Well, why was his father? That's why he had cool. Well, why was his father president of the United States?

Well, because Nixon resigned. Well, why did Nixon resign? Because of the Watergate scandal.

Well, why was there a Watergate scandal? Because two burglars at the Watergate building kind of botched the job because one of them forgot to close the door and latch it. And a night watchman noticed that the door was open, came in, discovered that there was a burglary and et cetera, et cetera.

Now, here's the point. What if that door hadn't been left open? We wouldn't be here.

You wouldn't be here. Do you dare think you ever know enough about what's going on in your life to be mad at God for it? Do you know why this and that happens?

How could you ever be in a position to be the judge? Why are you worried because you don't have an angry God who's working everything out justly? Why are you worried?

Why can't you forgive? Why can't you live in this city, civilly looking at everybody else as an equal because you don't have an angry God? So first of all, you need an angry God if you're going to live in hope.

Secondly, you've got to have an angry God if you're going to live in humility, civility, thirdly. And lastly, you need an angry God if you're really going to understand how loved you are. Now, I know this sounds the most contradictory.

What? The angrier you understand God to be against sin and evil, the greater His wrath, the greater His justice, the greater His judgment, the more you believe in hell, to the degree that you grasp those truths, to that degree you'll know how much He loves you. Let's move right on down through the text.

First of all, look, verses 8 and 9, something very interesting happens here, especially the Stegelic here, verse 8. Yet, O Father, you are our Father, we are the clay, you are the potter, we are all the work of your hand. Do not be angry beyond measure, O Lord, do not remember our sins forever.

Now, you know, this is very interesting. First of all, God is characterized here as a Father and as an artist, a Father and an artist. See, because first of all, he says, you are our Father, that means us your children, us his children, and you are the potter, which means he's the artist and we are the clay, we're the aren't work.

Now, first, there's two things that actually are derived from this verse. First of all, look, the first thing we're told is that God's love is the cause of his anger. Because notice, he doesn't say, yet, O Lord, you are our Father and you are our artist, so you shouldn't be angry.

That's not what he says. He said, you shouldn't be angry forever. You shouldn't be angry beyond measure.

Beyond measure, actually, it literally means unto muchness, which is the same as ultimately forever. Go back. The first thing that teaches us is because he's a Father and because he's an artist, his anger is justified.

Very important to see, he doesn't say, because you're our Father, you shouldn't be angry. Oh, no, not at all. Fathers and artists get angry.

Oh, my, do they get angry? It's so interesting that this verse, in light of this famous quote by C. S.

Lewis, in the problem of pain, chapter 3, Lewis says this, you ask for a loving God? Well, you have one. The great Lord of terrible aspect loves you.

Not a senile benevolence that drowsily wishes you to be happy in your own way. Not the cold philanthropy of a conscientious magistrate, nor the care of a host who feels somehow responsible for the comfort of his guests, but the consuming fire himself. The love that made the world's persistent as the artist's love for her work, a Father's love for a child, inexorable and exacting as a man's love for his wife.

Now, what is he saying? I'll say what he's saying. The opposite of love is not anger.

Oh, no, the opposite of love is hate, and the ultimate hate is indifference. But see, when you're passionately hating somebody, you're really giving them quite a lot of attention. I mean, you're treating them as important.

I mean, if that's not so bad, the passionately, the ultimate hate is to be not care. And therefore, if God looks down at this world and sees how we're treating each other and sees how we're living and sees how we're treating him, if God looks out this world and is not furious, he is not a Father and he is not an artist, and we are not his artwork and we are not his kids. If God is a, because, as Louis says, some other place, anger is what love bleeds when you cut it.

If someone really loves you and you're screwing up and you're doing something wrong, then you're blowing it and you're doing a lot of bad things, that person is furious at you. And if they're not furious at you, it doesn't matter what they say, that's just sentimentality, they don't love you. And therefore, what we see, first of all, it's very important, is God's love is furious love and is furious loving fury.

They come together, you've got to believe in both. That's what we're trying to do. We're trying to show you that they're really two sides the same coin.

So God's love is the cause of his anger. But the second thing we're told here, and this is the tension almost, God's love also is not just the cause of his anger. God's love is also the satisfaction of his anger.

It's not just here we're being taught that this is love that causes his anger. It's also being hinted at, but it's very strong. Yet because your father, you should be angry, but do something about your anger.

Don't be angry forever. Don't be angry unto muchness. Don't be angry ultimately.

Do something. There's a fascinating place where Louis, C. S.

Lewis is writing a guy named Malcolm, and Malcolm says, oh, I don't like this idea of an angry God. I just can't buy this idea of an angry God. And Louis says something fascinating.

He says, my dear Malcolm, think of the fullest reconciliation between people. Is peace restored through a moral lecture? Or is peace restored if the offense is not said to matter?

Now that's pretty interesting because on the one hand, there's moralism and there's relativism. There's two ways to deal. Let's just say somebody's done something wrong.

You're un-reconciled with somebody. You're un-reconciled. What do you do?

A moral lecture? Or else, oh, I guess who's to say whether what you did was wrong? A moralism relative?

No, listen, what he says. What should you do? If not moralism and not relativism, anger.

He says, think of the fullest reconciliation between people. Is peace restored through moral lecture? Or the offense is not to matter?

You know better. Anger, not pivish, fits of temper, but just generous, scalding indignation. It is anger that passes, not necessarily all at once, but anger that passes into embracing, exultant, rewelcoming love.

That's how friends and lovers are truly reconciled. Hot wrath and then hot love. Such anger is the fluid that love bleeds when you cut it.

I know what he's talking about. So it's probably you, but you know how rare that is. Because usually, usually when somebody sins against you, you're not angry because you don't love them.

Other times, you are angry because you do love them. But when you get that anger expressed, you blow up at them. You don't know how to do a surgical strike with your anger.

What Lewis is saying is he says, a moral lecture where you hold the anger in or you try to blow it off or you shrug it off or you pass it over. That doesn't work. Here's what works.

When you come in, you express your anger and you say, I love you. That's why I'm angry. And I hate what you're doing to yourself and I hate what you're doing to my relationship with you.

And I won't put up with it anymore. And I'm mad. And when you do a surgical strike, when you actually put the anger on the sin, when you put the anger on the evil, when you pour out your wrath on the sin itself, it's keeping you from the other person.

Very often, that kind of anger is what really wakes the person up. That kind of anger is what really embraces makes you eventually fall in each other's arms. Oh yeah.

Hot. Hot anger. Hot love.

God did do it. We know he did it because remember our sins no more. Do something.

Your love is the cause of your anger, but let your love be the satisfaction of your anger. And of course verse 17 says, yeah, of course, he says, I will recreate you. I will change you.

I will remember your sins no more. How did he do it? Well, it's pretty simple, but it's critical on the cross.

We read about it last week on the cross. Is God going to be a God of justice, but not a God of fury, but not love? Is he going to punish us, but then he loses us, or is he going to love us and then not be just?

Only if the cross happened, only if the cross happened. Can he be a God of furious love and loving fury? All at once.

Because all he hears what the Bible teaches. Jesus Christ is the judge who was judged. Jesus Christ took all of the anger for all the wrath, for all of the injustice.

And it went into his heart, so that when you believe in him, there's nothing left for you. Now, he don't ask you this question. Now, let's go back.

This is the point. Do you believe in a God of wrath? Ah, somebody says, no, I don't.

I don't, I believe God is a God of love. I don't believe he punishes people. What did it cost your God to love you?

Well, you say, I don't know, nothing. I guess. Well, then how do you know how much you love?

He loves you. This is the reason why you're not thrilled by the idea. This reason why you haven't had your life changed by the idea.

It's just sentimentality. To the degree you believe in justice and you believe in anger and you believe in hell to that degree, you know how much you're worth to him because he paid it. If you don't believe in hell, if you don't believe in punishment, if you don't believe in justice and if you don't believe in judgment, you have no idea what God did for you.

You have no idea what Jesus did for you. You have no idea how valuable you are. You don't walk around filling love to the sky.

You don't, you don't. And it's your fault because you don't have an angry God because you're just going along with what everybody said. Don't do it.

If you know what he did for you, if you know there's no judgment left for you, then when you're walking on the street like this happens to everybody and something comes along and hits you and you say, you call yourself a good person. That voice, the part you wretch, retreat and shame. And Jesus says, come hear my love, I bore the blame.

You must sit down and taste my meat. So I did sit and eat at George Herbert. But look, here's what, how do you know he loves you?

How do you know how much he loves you? How do you walk around filling love? Angry God who paid the penalty himself.

Now look, let's just, let's conclude with this just a couple of thoughts. Remember I said in the beginning, unless you have a God of both fury and love, loving fury and furious love, there'll be distortions in your life. Just think about this with me for a second.

Okay, let's apply this. Do you have a God of love only? Love without anger.

You know, love, do you have a God who never says no to you? There's anything in the Bible you don't like you say, why can't believe in that anymore? Therefore you don't have a God who can contradict you.

You don't have a God who can say no to you. You don't have a God who actually does anything, but always accept you. That means you don't have a God.

You have it, but yourself. And here's what you're like. Try to raise a kid like that.

Try to raise a kid where you never contradict them. You never cross their will. You never chaste in them.

You never discipline them. You never say no to them. Raise a child like that.

Listen, abusive parents are pretty bad. Permissive parents are every bit as bad. Kids that grow up like that feel like orphans and they are.

And people who grow up with an idea of a God who just loves them and accepts them in every way, they grow up feeling like orphan spiritually and they are. You know, you say, you know, you have a God of love without fury. You don't really have a God.

But then on the other hand, do you have an angry God who's not a God of love, a God of standards, a God of righteousness? It won't work. Your life won't work.

You know, it's interesting at the end of Luke 16, a very famous parable of Lazarus in the rich man. There's a place where Abraham's calls him in pardon me. The rich man is down in hell and he calls up to Abraham and he says, Father Abraham, if I knew about hell, you know, I wouldn't have lived the way I lived.

So my brothers are still alive. Would you please send somebody back from the dead to go and tell them about this place? So they'll judge them in their lives.

And what does Abraham say? It won't be enough. You said, what?

Somebody coming back from the dead saying, stop, you know, it's Marley's ghost. Oh, stop, please, obey the thinking amendments. Or you'll be like me.

That won't be enough. It was enough for Scrooge. That's fiction.

That's fiction. I'm a pastor. I've seen an awful lot of people make promises to an angry God.

Promises when they felt like they were stock promises when they felt like, oh, I better do something or God's going to get me. They never work because fear cannot awaken love in you. Only love can awaken love in you.

And if you have nothing but an angry guy, see if you have a loving God without fury, you've got nothing. But if you have a furious God without love, you've got something and it'll crush you. You will be a driven person.

You'll never be able to live up. You'll always be fling with no one pursuing. You'll be like two little butters stretched over too much bread.

When Paul said, the love of Christ constrains me, he was thinking of Jesus Christ another wrath of God, and that turned him into a man of courage. It melted his heart. It can do the same thing for you.

If you have never surrendered your life to this God, do you know what that means? His anger is at work in your life. What?

Yes, to drive you into the arms of his love, because that's what his anger is always after. So, go along. Let's pray.

Our Father, I pray if there's anybody here tonight who's certainly upset with the idea of an angry God, I pray that they would think and not just react. Father, for many of us, we have the intellectual belief that you're a God of justice and judgment, but we haven't thought out what the implications of that are. We pray that you would give us more peace.

You would give us more civility, more humility and a greater sense of our love, our loveness. And we ask that you would help us do that tonight by the power of your Holy Spirit. We thank you, Lord, that you're a God like this.

We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Thanks for listening to today's teaching.

嗯,最近我读了一本书,它是对这种极其常见的信念——我们必须超越复仇之神才能拥有一个和平的世界——最有力的驳斥之一。

实际上是一本非常了不起的书。在很多方面,这是一本由米罗斯拉夫·沃尔夫写的书,他是克罗地亚人,书名叫《排斥与拥抱》。让我读给你听他的论点。

他在这本书中说,因为他是克罗地亚人,他在前南斯拉夫长大,他看到了所有这些写这段经文的人所看到的,那些哭求复仇、哭诉不公义的人。他看到了所有这些。他经历过这些。

这是他说的。非暴力的实践需要对神圣复仇的信仰。我再说一遍,因为,我是说,如果没有人挑眉毛,你就没在听。

非暴力的实践,好了,这样好些了。非暴力的实践需要对神圣复仇的信仰。他说,通往非暴力的唯一道路是相信一位对不公义发怒的神。

没有一位发怒的神,你永远出不来。你永远进不了非暴力。你会被困在暴力的循环中。

现在,他是怎么论证这一点的呢?好,就是这样。这是引文。

他说,我的论点——非暴力的实践需要对神圣复仇的信仰——会不受许多基督徒欢迎,特别是在西方。但对那些倾向于驳回它的人,请想象一下。想象你在一个战区做讲座,我在那里宣读这一章作为论文。

在你的听众中,有些人的城市和村庄先被洗劫,然后被烧毁,然后被夷为平地,他们的女儿和姐妹被强奸,他们的父亲和兄弟被割喉。现在,你讲座的主题是基督徒对暴力的态度,论点是我们不应该报复,不应该被卷入持续暴力的循环。我们不应该以牙还牙。

为什么不?这是他说的,暴力今天之所以猖獗,是因为暗暗地被这种信念滋养着:神拒绝拿起剑。然后他说,如果你这样做,如果你这样讲课,你很快就会发现,这个论点的诞生需要郊区的宁静。

人类的非暴力是一位拒绝审判的神的结果。在一个被无辜者的鲜血浸透的焦土上,这个想法必然会像自由主义思想的其他愉快俘虏一样死去。在一个暴力的世界里,如果神不挥剑,他就不配得神的身份。

如果神不对不公义和欺骗发怒,不最终结束暴力,那位神就不配得我们的敬拜。现在,我能简单说一下吗?这是他在说的。

任何说复仇之神会导致暴力的人,实际上自己都没有成为暴力的受害者。你生活在一个美好的郊区小泡泡里,或者一个非常、非常好的地方,在那里你自己没有成为不公义的受害者。他说,当你成为不公义的受害者时,你将不得不报复,除非你确信有一位复仇之神,有一位憎恨不公义的神,有一位对不公义发怒的神。

有一位会清算每一笔账、让没有人逃脱的神,除非你相信一位神圣复仇的神,你将无法抗拒拿起剑,你知道,自己成为复仇者,否则你就会在绝望中死去。这就是为什么他能够回来说,正是非暴力的实践绝对需要对神圣复仇的信仰。所以这是我们的第一点。

你知道,人们说,我为什么需要一位发怒的神?他说,没有对审判者的信仰,非暴力是不可能的。事实上,让我,让我,让我再进一步说。

如果你是,他所说的这些自由主义虔诚的受害者之一,你总是听说,我相信一位公义的神,这不会导致世界和平。这会导致更多暴力。他说,你绝对会,如果有人真的来对你做坏事,你会立刻被卷入报复中。

实际上,你已经被卷入了。他只是可能在许多情况下,你还没有真正遭到攻击、流血或被杀,或者,或者你的家人被杀。有人试图这样做。

他说,因为除非你相信一位复仇之神,你就不会是一个和平缔造者。你将无法在这个世界上过和平的生活。你将无法在这个世界上带着盼望生活。

事实上,有一件事让我担心,如果我看着,你们中的许多人,你们中的许多人确实生活在那个泡泡里,因为我们大多数人生活在一个比世界上任何其他地方、任何其他时代的大多数人都更安全、更快乐、更有保障的世界里。如果那个泡泡破裂了,而你有一个软弱的神,不对不公义进行复仇,你要么会被卷入暴力,你将不得不自己报复,要么。你会在绝望中死去。

这是第一点。你需要一位神。你需要一位发怒的神,否则你将无法在一个不公义的世界中和平生活。

第二,如果你要带着谦卑生活,你需要一位发怒的神。现在,这是非常有趣的。让我们继续看接下来的三节经文。

所有的注释家都说,看到第一节和第二节之间的讽刺关系是极其有趣的,第一节是第1到3节。我们刚刚读过。他们在说的是,我们是不公义的受害者。

所以我们向世界呼召审判之神降临。如果你能降临,使山岭震动,会发生什么?嗯,敌人,恶人,敌人,坏国家,他们会做什么?他们会被吞灭。

他们会变成尘土。他们会被吞灭。风会把他们吹走。

但听这个。看,在你面前,第2节,列国会在你面前震颤。但现在看,第4、5、6节,这是极大的讽刺。

谁现在在颤抖?谁在消亡?看,谁在像叶子一样颤抖,第6节?

像风一样,我们的罪把我们吹走。是他们。他们呼召神降临要做的事正发生在他们身上。

这就是我们所说的。顺便说一下,在这一点上,这是一个极其重要的小测试,可以知道你是否理解了愤怒之神的区别,也许你被教导过,或者你教过别人,也许有人在你成长过程中教导你,或者也许你被教导别人相信一位愤怒的神。和圣经中的愤怒之神,当你遇到圣经中的愤怒之神时,你会发现,你会看到他们所看到的。

你会从第1到3节中得到。当你在1到3节时,你所想的是,如果神降临,坏人会被审判。但在第4到6节中,他们发现我们也和其他人一样该受审判,我们也在审判之下,我们也绝对该受惩罚,就像我们认为是恶的加害者的那些人一样。

这绝对是关键的,这是知道你是否与圣经的神有联系的一个重要测试。让我告诉你我的意思。世界上有两种人似乎是对立的。

世界上有两种人,那些把世界上所有人分成两种人的人,和那些不这样做的人。你知道吗?好吧,我的意思是世界上有两类非常突出的人。

我不是说只有两种人。一方面,你有我们称之为宗教人士的人,传统上的宗教人士。他们当然相信有绝对的标准,有绝对的道德价值观,我们会被它们审判。

因此他们相信,如果神降临,他会审判坏人。而那些宗教的人,他们会说,嗯,我不欺骗我的配偶,我照顾我的家庭,我遵守十诫,我去教会或犹太会堂,我施舍给穷人,等等。我是个好人。

所以你在第1到3节。你说,如果神降临,你看,坏人会被审判,他们对自己感觉很好。另一方面,你有他们的对手。

我是说,在我们的社会里,对手,所以那些相信传统道德价值观的人,是,你可以称之为世俗人士,进步的自由派人士,他们说的是,你知道吗?每个人,罪是见仁见智的。每个人都有自己定义罪的方式。

对你来说是罪的,对我来说可能不是罪,我们必须做的是我们必须拥抱他们。我们必须拥抱每个人。我们必须宽容每个人。

我们必须接纳每个人。他们看起来非常、非常宽容,除了他们也同样在第1到3节。因为他们所说的是,是的,你知道,这个世界的问题是,是那些不宽容的人。

我不像他们。你看,他们是宗教人士,宗教人士,都在到处走动说,如果世界上每个人都像我一样,我们就不会有麻烦。如果那些造成麻烦的人,如果有人能把他们打倒就好了。

所以你看,你是宗教的还是非宗教的,你是保守的还是自由的,都不重要,如果你生活在第1、2、3节中。但基督徒会发生什么?当他们最终接近并看到神真正是什么样子时,不可避免地,他们说的是,第6节,我们都像不洁净的人一样,我们所有的义行都像污秽的衣服。

现在这是一个令人震惊的声明。事实上,你知道,当你第一次读到它时,你会说,等等,什么?他没有说我们所有的罪都是污秽的衣服。

当然,它们是污秽的衣服。我们所有的义,他不只是说义是一种一般的东西,我们的义行是污秽的衣服。发生的事情是,一个基督徒已经开始透过外表看进他或她自己的内心。

开始看动机。这是你唯一可能说我的义行很臭的方式。我是说,一个义行怎么能臭?

做正确的事怎么能臭?怎么能在神的鼻孔中成为恶臭?嗯,答案是,福音把你变成一种尼采式的人,当你看你自己的心时。

你开始尼采,当然,总是看动机。尼采几乎发明了所谓的怀疑诠释学。向内看,说,是的,是的,是的,是的,是的,你真的很好。

你去教会,你做这个,你做那个。但为什么?为什么你,你对每个人说,我们应该爱每个人,但你为什么说每个人?

你真正试图做的不是你试图压制人吗?你试图显得优越吗?你说,哦,我们应该服从,应该非常道德,但为什么你不是真的在试图保持权力吗?

你看,一个基督徒看着我你自己的心,这是基督徒在说的。基督徒是这样的人,他说,我来,我意识到我犯罪的原因和我做好事的原因是一样的,而且是错的。我不,即使当我做坏事时,我在试图做我自己的主,但当我做好事时,我也是。

当我做坏事时,我试图做我自己的救主,但当我做好事时,我也在试图做我自己的救主。当我做好事时,我真的是在试图让神按我的意愿行事,我试图控制他。我试图让他欠我。

我试图,你看,你能判断你的义是污秽衣服的一种方式。你们中的很多人都很有义。我要感谢你做了很多好事,但你总是生气,因为神没有让你的生活顺利。

为什么?你知道为什么吗?他说,我过着这么好的生活,我的嫂子或我的兄弟没有过很好的生活,我知道为什么我的生活这么糟糕?

哇,哇,等一下,尼采说,等一下。你为什么行善?试图让神按你的意愿行事。

这就是罪的本质。我们到处看到破碎、战争、残酷和心痛。我们在周围的世界和我们自己的生活中感受到它。

它怎么会变成这样?我们能做什么?在他本月发布的全新著作《世界怎么了?》中,

提摩太·凯勒提供了一个清晰而富有同情心的答案,他从在救赎主教会的一系列教导中汲取内容。凯勒博士展示了罪的现实如何解释我们周围看到的痛苦,以及只有福音才能提供持久的自由和医治。

无论你是被我们世界的状况所压倒,还是在与自己的错误或选择作斗争,或者在寻找盼望和喜乐,《世界怎么了?》将帮助你看到福音如何既回应我们世界的心痛,也回应我们每个人内心的痛苦。这本新发布的书《世界怎么了?》是我们对你本月帮助"生命中的福音"分享耶稣好消息的礼物的感谢。今天就在gospelandlife.com/give索取你的副本。

就是gospelandlife.com/give。现在是凯勒博士今天教导的其余部分。

这是罪的本质。每个人都按我的意愿行事。看,你知道,你的生命为我的,不是我的生命为你的。

我们的意愿相冲突,我走我的路,你知道吗?你的义是污秽的衣服。现在发生的是,除非你相信一位审判和公义的神,你来到那位神的面前,你永远不会被降卑。

我告诉你,正是理解这一点的基督徒是最有礼貌的人。我这是什么意思?除非你相信一位发怒的神,你就不会有礼貌。

你怎么能和所有这些如此不同的人一起生活在像纽约市这样的地方?不同的信仰、不同的种族、不同的文化、不同的哲学、不同的宗教。你怎么能?

现在,具有传统宗教价值观的人在城市生活中有很大的麻烦。因为他们说,我有真理。我有真理。

因此,我对这么多其他人感到如此优越。你不会是好公民。你不会服务他们。

你不会坐下来把他们当作平等的人对待。你就是不会。但如果你说,哦,我超越了那个,你看,我相信一切都是相对的。

但你会怎么做?你会对那些相信绝对价值观的人感到如此不安。你会,对吧,你会说,我比他们好得多。

我讨厌那种人。但等一下。你知道纽约市有多少人相信绝对价值观吗?

看看所有的穆斯林。看看所有的东正教犹太人。看,看看所有的,你知道,看看所有新教徒中的天主教徒,或天主教徒中的新教徒,等等。

我想让你知道,除非你相信你该受审判,否则你会是一个糟糕的邻居。你不会看着隔壁说,嘿,我和这个世界上的任何加害者一样该受审判。因此,我不会把自己看得比你优越。

除非你有这个,你会是一个糟糕的邻居。你不会有礼貌地生活。你也无法饶恕,因为你会把自己置于审判的位置。

你必须相信一位发怒的神、会清算所有账目的原因之一,是因为你们中的一些人现在正背负着巨大的负担。当你看到别人对你做了什么,事实上,当你看到生活对你做了什么,或者甚至神对你做了什么,你会不安,因为你不理解为什么这会发生在我身上?你所做的是你没有一位发怒的神。

你把自己放在审判者的位置上。你不相信一位真正会审判的神。这就是你无法饶恕的原因。

如果你现在在饶恕某人方面有困难,那是因为你被困在第1、2或3节,第1、2、3节。你还没有到第4到6节。如果你有困难,事实上,如果你甚至在理解为什么神让这个或那个发生方面有困难。

如果你只是如此不安,因为神没有让这个发生,神没有让那个发生。这周,我想起了很久以前发生在我身上的一件事。它对我的生活产生了很大的影响。

我今晚为什么在这里?为什么这个教会在这里?因为我的长老会教派派我来纽约。

嗯,我为什么是长老会的?嗯,因为我在神学院的最后一个学期受到了一位特定老师的影响。我在研究生院的最后一个学期。

他刚到那里,因为,你知道,在最后,但因为我受到他的影响,我成为了长老会,因此我被派到这里,因此我们在这里。嗨,那么那个人为什么来那个学校?嗯,你知道,他差点没成功,但他,因为他是英国人,他有签证问题。

但国务院的某个人认识神学院的某个人,神学院的一个人动用了一些关系,他及时赶到了。所以如果那个人没有动用那些关系。他就不会到那里。

我就不会受他的影响。我就不会成为长老会。我就不会在这里。

嗯,有人说那很有趣。为什么神学院的某个人在国务院有权力?嗯,当时神学院有一个名叫迈克·福特的学生,他的父亲是杰拉尔德·福特,当时是美国总统。

嗯,为什么他的父亲?这就是为什么他有影响力。嗯,为什么他的父亲是美国总统?

嗯,因为尼克松辞职了。嗯,为什么尼克松辞职?因为水门事件丑闻。

嗯,为什么有水门事件丑闻?因为水门大厦的两个窃贼有点搞砸了,因为其中一个忘记关门并锁上。一个夜班守卫注意到门开着,进来了,发现有盗窃,等等,等等。

现在,重点是。如果那扇门没有被留开会怎样?我们就不会在这里。

你就不会在这里。你敢认为你对你生活中发生的事情了解得足够多,可以对神生气吗?你知道为什么会发生这个和那个吗?

你怎么可能处于审判者的位置?你为什么担心,因为你没有一位愤怒的、正在公正地处理一切的神?你为什么担心?

你为什么不能饶恕?你为什么不能在这个城市有礼貌地生活,把其他每个人都看作平等的,因为你没有一位发怒的神?所以首先,如果你要带着盼望生活,你需要一位发怒的神。

第二,如果你要带着谦卑、有礼貌地生活,你必须有一位发怒的神,第三。

最后,如果你真的要理解你有多被爱,你需要一位发怒的神。现在,我知道这听起来最矛盾。

什么?你越理解神对罪和邪恶的愤怒,他的愤怒越大,他的公义越大,他的审判越大,你越相信地狱,你抓住这些真理的程度,就是你知道他有多爱你的程度。让我们继续往下看经文。

首先,看,第8和9节,这里发生了一些非常有趣的事情,特别是这里的策略,第8节。然而,哦父,你是我们的父,我们是泥,你是窑匠,我们都是你手的工作。耶和华啊,不要大发震怒,不要永远记念我们的罪。

现在,你知道,这很有趣。首先,神在这里被描述为一位父亲和一位艺术家,一位父亲和一位艺术家。看,因为首先,他说,你是我们的父,那意味着我们是你的孩子,我们是他的孩子,你是窑匠,这意味着他是艺术家,我们是泥,我们不是艺术品。

现在,首先,实际上从这节经文中得出两件事。首先,看,我们被告知的第一件事是,神的爱是他愤怒的原因。因为注意,他没有说,然而,主啊,你是我们的父,你是我们的艺术家,所以你不应该发怒。

那不是他说的。他说,你不应该永远发怒。你不应该过度发怒。

过度,实际上,字面意思是到很多,这和最终永远是一样的。回去。它教导我们的第一件事是,因为他是父亲,因为他是艺术家,他的愤怒是合理的。

看到这一点非常重要,他没有说,因为你是我们的父,你不应该发怒。哦,不,一点也不。父亲和艺术家会发怒。

哦天哪,他们会发怒吗?非常有趣的是,这节经文,考虑到C.S.路易斯在《痛苦的奥秘》第3章中的这句名言,路易斯这样说,你要求一位有爱的神?嗯,你有一位。这位具有可怕面貌的伟大主爱你。

不是一种昏昏欲睡地希望你以自己的方式快乐的衰老的仁慈。不是一个有良心的法官的冷淡慈善,也不是一个主人对客人舒适感到有某种责任的关怀,而是那吞灭的火本身。创造世界的爱,像艺术家对她作品的爱一样持久,像父亲对孩子的爱,像男人对妻子的爱一样不可动摇和严格。

现在,他在说什么?我来说他在说什么。爱的反面不是愤怒。

哦,不,爱的反面是恨,而终极的恨是冷漠。但看,当你激烈地恨某人时,你实际上给了他们相当多的关注。我是说,你把他们当作重要的。

我是说,如果那还不算太坏,激烈地,终极的恨是不在乎。因此,如果神俯视这个世界,看到我们如何对待彼此,看到我们如何生活,看到我们如何对待他,如果神看着这个世界却不愤怒,他就不是一位父亲,他就不是一位艺术家,我们就不是他的艺术品,我们就不是他的孩子。如果神是,因为,正如路易斯在其他地方说的,当你割开爱时,愤怒就是爱流出的血。

如果有人真的爱你,而你搞砸了,你做错了事,你正在破坏它,你做了很多坏事,那个人会对你很愤怒。如果他们不对你愤怒,不管他们说什么,那只是感情用事,他们不爱你。因此,我们看到的,首先,非常重要的是,神的爱是愤怒的爱,是愤怒的爱的愤怒。

它们在一起,你必须相信两者。这就是我们试图做的。我们试图向你展示它们实际上是同一枚硬币的两面。

所以神的爱是他愤怒的原因。但我们在这里被告知的第二件事,这几乎是张力,神的爱不只是他愤怒的原因。神的爱也是他愤怒的满足。

不只是在这里我们被教导这是导致他愤怒的爱。也被暗示,但它非常强烈。然而,因为你是父亲,你应该发怒,但对你的愤怒做点什么。

不要永远发怒。不要发怒到很多。不要最终发怒。

做点什么。有一个引人入胜的地方,路易斯,C.S.路易斯正在给一个叫马尔科姆的人写信,马尔科姆说,哦,我不喜欢这个发怒的神的想法。我就是不能接受这个发怒的神的想法。路易斯说了一些引人入胜的话。

他说,我亲爱的马尔科姆,想想人与人之间最完全的和解。和平是通过道德讲座恢复的吗?还是和平是在冒犯被说成无关紧要时恢复的?

现在那很有趣,因为一方面,有道德主义和相对主义。有两种处理方式。假设有人做错了什么。

你与某人不和解。你不和解。你怎么办?

道德讲座?还是,哦,我想谁能说你做的是错的?道德主义相对?

不,听,他说什么。你应该怎么做?如果不是道德主义和相对主义,是愤怒。

他说,想想人与人之间最完全的和解。和平是通过道德讲座恢复的吗?还是冒犯无关紧要?

你更了解。愤怒,不是孩子气的发脾气,而是正义的、慷慨的、灼热的愤慨。是愤怒,不一定一下子就过去,但愤怒会变成拥抱、欢欣、欢迎的爱。

这就是朋友和恋人真正和解的方式。炽热的愤怒,然后炽热的爱。这样的愤怒是你割开爱时流出的血。

我知道他在说什么。所以你也可能知道,但你知道那有多罕见。因为通常,通常当有人对你犯罪时,你不生气是因为你不爱他们。

其他时候,你生气是因为你确实爱他们。但当你表达那种愤怒时,你对他们发火。你不知道如何用你的愤怒进行外科手术式的打击。

路易斯说的是,他说,一个道德讲座,你把愤怒憋在里面,或者你试图把它吹掉,或者你耸耸肩,或者你掩盖过去。那不管用。这才管用。

当你进来,你表达你的愤怒,你说,我爱你。这就是我为什么生气。我恨你对自己做的事,我恨你对我和你的关系做的事。

我不会再忍受了。我很生气。当你进行外科手术式的打击时,当你真正把愤怒放在罪上,当你把愤怒放在邪恶上,当你把你的愤怒倾倒在使你与对方分离的罪本身上。

很多时候,那种愤怒才是真正唤醒那个人的。那种愤怒才是真正的拥抱,使你们最终落入彼此的怀抱。哦是的。

炽热。炽热的愤怒。炽热的爱。

神确实做了。我们知道他做了,因为不再记念我们的罪。做点什么。

你的爱是你愤怒的原因,但让你的爱成为你愤怒的满足。当然第17节说,是的,当然,他说,我会重新创造你。我会改变你。

我不再记念你的罪。他是怎么做的?嗯,这很简单,但在十字架上至关重要。

我们上周读到过,在十字架上。神是要成为一位公义的神,但不是一位愤怒的神,但不是爱吗?他是要惩罚我们,但然后他失去我们,还是他要爱我们,然后不公义?

只有如果十字架发生了,只有如果十字架发生了。他才能同时是一位愤怒的爱和有爱的愤怒的神吗?全部一次。

因为这里所有的都是圣经的教导。耶稣基督是被审判的审判者。耶稣基督承受了所有的愤怒,所有的忿怒,因为所有的不公义。

它进入了他的心,所以当你相信他时,对你就什么也没有了。现在,他不问你这个问题。现在,让我们回去。

这就是重点。你相信一位愤怒的神吗?啊,有人说,不,我不相信。

我不,我相信神是有爱的神。我不相信他惩罚人。你的神爱你花了什么代价?

嗯,你说,我不知道,什么也没有。我想。嗯,那你怎么知道你有多少爱?

他爱你。这就是为什么你对这个想法不感到兴奋的原因。这就是为什么你的生活没有被这个想法改变的原因。

这只是感情用事。你相信公义的程度,你相信愤怒的程度,你相信地狱的程度,你就知道你对他有多值得,因为他付了代价。如果你不相信地狱,如果你不相信惩罚,如果你不相信公义,如果你不相信审判,你不知道神为你做了什么。

你不知道耶稣为你做了什么。你不知道你有多宝贵。你不会走来走去充满爱到天空。

你不会,你不会。这是你的错,因为你没有一位发怒的神,因为你只是随波逐流,随着每个人说的。不要这样做。

如果你知道他为你做了什么,如果你知道对你没有审判了,那么当你像这样走在街上,每个人都会遇到,有东西过来击中你,你说,你还称自己是好人吗。那个声音,那一部分你这个可怜虫,退缩和羞愧。耶稣说,来听我的爱,我承担了责备。

你必须坐下来品尝我的肉。所以我确实坐下来吃了,乔治·赫伯特。但看,这是什么,你怎么知道他爱你?

你怎么知道他有多爱你?你怎么能走来走去充满爱?愤怒的神亲自付了代价。

现在看,让我们,让我们,让我们用这个来结束。只是几个想法。记得我在开头说的,除非你有一位既愤怒又有爱的神,有爱的愤怒和愤怒的爱,你的生活中会有扭曲。和我一起想想这个。

好,让我们应用这个。你有一位只有爱的神吗?没有愤怒的爱。

你知道,爱,你有一位从不对你说不的神吗?圣经中有任何你不喜欢的东西,你说,为什么不能再相信那个?因此你没有一位能反驳你的神。

你没有一位能对你说不的神。你没有一位实际上做任何事情,只是总是接纳你的神。那意味着你没有神。

你有它,但是你自己。这就是你的样子。试着那样养一个孩子。

试着养一个你从不反驳他们的孩子。你从不违背他们的意愿。你从不责罚他们。

你从不管教他们。你从不对他们说不。养这样的孩子。

听着,虐待的父母相当糟糕。放任的父母同样糟糕。那样成长的孩子感觉像孤儿,他们确实是。

而那些成长时有一个只是爱他们、以各种方式接纳他们的神的想法的人,他们在精神上成长时感觉像孤儿,他们确实是。你知道,你说,你知道,你有一位没有愤怒的爱的神。你没有真正的神。

但另一方面,你有一位愤怒的神,他不是有爱的神,一位标准的神,一位公义的神吗?它不会起作用。你的生活不会起作用。

你知道,在路加福音16章末尾很有趣,一个非常著名的拉撒路和财主的比喻。有一个地方,亚伯拉罕的,请原谅我。财主在地狱里,他向亚伯拉罕呼叫,他说,父亚伯拉罕,如果我知道地狱,你知道,我不会那样生活。

所以我的兄弟们还活着。你能不能请派人从死里回来,去告诉他们这个地方?这样他们就会审判他们的生活。

亚伯拉罕说什么?这还不够。你说,什么?

有人从死里回来说,停下,你知道,这是马利的鬼魂。哦,停下,请,遵守那些修正案。否则你会像我一样。

那还不够。对史克鲁奇来说够了。那是虚构的。

那是虚构的。我是牧师。我见过很多很多人向一位愤怒的神许诺。

当他们感觉自己被困住时的承诺,当他们感觉,哦,我最好做点什么,否则神会来找我。它们从不起作用,因为恐惧不能唤醒你心中的爱。只有爱才能唤醒你心中的爱。

如果你只有一位愤怒的人,看,如果你有一位没有愤怒的有爱的神,你什么都没有。但如果你有一位没有爱的愤怒的神,你有些东西,它会压垮你。你会是一个被驱使的人。

你永远无法达到。你总是在逃跑,没有人追赶。你会像在太多面包上抹的太薄的黄油。

当保罗说,基督的爱激励我,他在想耶稣基督另一个神的愤怒,那把他变成了一个勇敢的人。它融化了他的心。它也能为你做同样的事。

如果你从未向这位神降服你的生命,你知道那意味着什么吗?他的愤怒在你的生活中起作用。什么?

是的,把你驱赶进他的爱的怀抱,因为那就是他的愤怒一直追求的。所以,继续吧。让我们祷告。

我们的父,我祷告,如果今晚这里有人肯定对愤怒的神的想法感到不安,我祈祷他们会思考而不只是反应。父,对我们许多人来说,我们在理智上相信你是一位公义和审判的神,但我们没有想清楚这意味着什么。我们祈祷你会给我们更多的平安。

你会给我们更多的礼貌、更多的谦卑和更大的爱的感受,我们被爱的感受。我们祈求你今晚借着你圣灵的能力帮助我们做到这一点。我们感谢你,主,你是这样一位神。

我们奉耶稣的名祷告。阿门。感谢你收听今天的教导。
