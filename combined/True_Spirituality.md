# 真正的灵性 / True Spirituality

**讲员**: 提摩太·凯勒 (Tim Keller)

---

Welcome to Gospel in Life. This month on the podcast, we are featuring a series on the sermon on the Mount, a collection of teachings where Jesus outlines what it really means to live the Christian life. In the series, Tim Keller explores a striking idea that Christianity is not just different from the world, it's also radically different from religion.

Now, we've been going through the sermon on the Mount, all spring, and we come to the end of the sermon on the Mount, this is a summarizing passage, it's this summary, it's the end of the sermon, and therefore Jesus is pulling together everything he's been saying, and because it's a summarizing passage for the whole sermon, it therefore is also a summarizing sermon for the whole series, in fact, the whole year, but we're going to be able to pull together everything we've been saying about the sermon on the Mount, all this year. And therefore, I want to congratulate those of you who are just visiting today, this is your first time, a Redeemer, it's the only time you've been a Redeemer in a long time, I just want to congratulate you for being very clever, because it's the best possible, you'd see all these other poor people have been spending hours and weeks trying to figure out the sermon on the Mount, and you're going to get it in a nutshell, it's a very, very smart of you, let me, let me read you, Matthew 7, verse 15 to 29, the end of the sermon. Watch out, Jesus said, watch out for false prophets, they come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves, by their fruit you will recognize them, do people pick grapes from the thorn bushes or figs from the thistles, likewise every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit, a good tree cannot bear bad fruit and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit, every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire, thus by their fruit you will recognize them, not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my father who is in heaven, many will say to me on that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles, and then I will tell them plainly, I never knew you, away from me, you evil doers, therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock, the rain came down, the streams rose and the winds blew and beat against that house, yet it did not fall because it had its foundations on the rock, but everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand, the rain came down, the sun rose, the streams rose, and the wind blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash, and when Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching because he taught us one who had authority and not as their teachers of the law.

Okay, this is God's word. The trouble of the sermon on the mount is it's so familiar. It's some of the most familiar material in the English language or in history, in the whole world, the Beatitudes, you know, turn the other cheek, love your neighbor, and all that, and because it's so familiar, almost nobody listens to it.

Almost nobody really knows what it's saying. Now, how do we know that? Because here at the very end, the very, very end of this sermon, Matthew says something that almost is a throw away, you almost tend to go right by and say, yeah, yeah, yeah, but it's actually extremely important because it's a test, it's the way you know whether you've actually heard what Jesus is saying in the sermon on the mount.

Look, verse 28, here's the test, here's how you know, when Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching. Now this, it doesn't mean, it's not like, wow, amazed is a very strong Greek word. It means thunder struck.

It means shocked, and it's interestingly enough, I was one, several commentators that I read were saying on top of that, you also have an imperfect Greek tense, and that's unusual. In other words, this means the people were thunder struck, they were shocked out of their senses, and the more they thought about it, they went on getting more and more, astounded all the time, they were astounded, and not just a few people, the crowds. This is the prevailing way people responded when Jesus gave the sermon on the mount.

Now have you been astounded? Are you shocked by it? But you say, well, I know it, I know what's interesting, I know it, I know all about it.

If you're not astounded, you haven't listened to it, so let's listen to it. There's basically three great things Jesus says that are utterly astounding, and my guess is, you yourself have probably not heard, as familiar as you may be with the sermon on the mount. Three things.

They have to do with the fact that Jesus here at the very end of the sermon says, there are two ways, there are two basic options spiritually. Two ways that I want you to distinguish. Two ways that I want you to see, and make sure you choose the right one, not the wrong one.

Two ways, so first of all he says there's two ways, and secondly he says at the end of those two ways there's a judge, and then he says at the end of the judgment, there's a sentence. There's two ways at the end of the judge sentence, the way is there's the judgment, at the end of the judgment there's the sentence, and he says something very astounding about all three, very. Here's what they are, first.

The first thing he says, he says something about the two ways that are astounding. What are the two ways? Notice, actually we start the sermon here in verse 15.

If he would start at verse 13, which I didn't, in writing this out for you in the bulletin, that's where it says there's two paths, one to life, one to death, and then here it says there's two trees, one with good fruit, one with bad fruit, and then you get down to verse 24, there's two houses, one built on a rock, one built on the sand, so Jesus is saying there are these two spiritual approaches, two ways, and I want you to be able to distinguish between them and choose the right one. But the most, one of the most important things, one of the most interesting things about these two ways, is that they're hard to discern from one another, they're hard. Notice for example, it doesn't say there's two trees, there's a tree with fruit and a tree without fruit.

And I say it doesn't take much discernment. If you walk into an orchard in June, and up there are leaves, here's a bunch of trees and they have leaves on them and they have fruit on them, what kind of tree has fruit in June. Well, they have leaves on them, they have fruit on them, and right next is a tree with no leaves, no fruit.

Okay, rocket scientists, put on your thinking cap, which one's alive and which one's dead? I wonder. We'll see, it doesn't take any discernment, but that's not what Jesus says, Jesus does not say these two ways or two paths, in one you have tree without fruit, one tree with fruit, no look, verse 16, by their fruit you will recognize them, verse 18, a tree cannot bear bad fruit, a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.

And so what we're talking about is a tree, two trees, they both bear fruit, but one, the word bad means poison, it doesn't mean shriveled, it means poison. The two trees they look exactly alike, one of them that's a fruit is poison, or the two houses they look exactly alike, to the visible, to the naked eye, what's visible looks the same, it's only what's hidden that makes a difference. Now what are these two paths, what are these two ways, and everybody thinks they know, and in fact I used to think I knew, because I preached on this before, wrongly, because here's what almost everybody thinks, they say, well it's very simple what Jesus is saying he's saying this is the good people and the bad people, this is the way of obeying God and the way of disobeying God, here's the sermon on the mount, the sermon on the mount tells you how to be good, the sermon on the mount tells you in chapter 5, love your neighbor, in chapter 6 it says give to the poor, it says pray, Lord's prayer, so love your neighbor and give to the poor and pray, it's telling you how to live a good life, and here at the end Jesus says here are the two paths, here are the two trees, here are the two houses, you can either follow the sermon on the mount, you can live a good life, or you can live a wicked and selfish and licentious life, but is that what he's saying, how much discernment does it take to tell a difference to a person who prays and goes to church and who doesn't, doesn't take any discernment, it's easy, here's a person who prays and goes to church, here's a person who doesn't, here's a person who's courteous to his neighbor, and here's a person who beats and stabs his neighbor, how much discernment does that take, and would Jesus Christ be likening these two ways to trees or houses or ways that look exactly like on the outside, no, Jesus is not talking about good people and about bad people, and if you want to see, you can partly see it here when he says he gives two examples, two human examples of bad trees, first he says watch out for false prophets, they come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they're ferocious wolves, now see sheep, it's a universal term in the old New Testament, the sheep is the people of God, the Lord is my shepherd, I'm a sheep, and so what it's saying is here, these are prophets, which means they're speakers, they're teachers, but they're sheep, at least as far as I can see, these aren't skeptics, these aren't atheists, these aren't licentious people, these aren't immoral people, on the outside they look like religious and moral paragons, because they're prophets, virtuous people, but now if you want to really see it clear, and if you really want to have your teeth rattled a little bit I'm going to try, is look at the second example of a bad fruit, a bad trees, he says on that day many will say Lord, Lord did we not prophesy in your name, did we not in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?

Now who are these people? First of all they call Jesus Lord, and all commentators agree on this one, and that means this person who sang this to Jesus is saying you're God, you're divine, this particular word Lord, Kurios actually was a word that in the Greek Old Testament, that means the Greek translation of the Old Testament is Septuagin, wherever the divine name Yahweh came along, Kurios translated that, and it's very clear that this person is coming to Jesus and saying you're the son of God, I believe the doctrine, I believe the hypostatic union, I believe the two natures of Christ, I believe that you're the son of the God, I believe your deity, I believe all the doctrine, so here's an orthodox believing person, subscribes all the doctrines, secondly, he doesn't just say Lord, he says Lord Lord, and that's a Seminic construction, to talk about or to convey intensity of emotion, and if you're going to really have emotion, you don't just say Absalom, you say Absalom Absalom, you say Mary Mary, Martha Martha, my God, my God, in other words, it's intensity of emotion, and here's this person coming up, I'm not just saying I believe your God, I didn't say just Lord, he says Lord Lord, which means he's emotionally engaged, he's excited about Jesus, it gets worse and worse, and then he says, we're told that this the person, he says I prophesied in your name, that's God of mean at least, teach the Bible, teach the message of Jesus, and then it says I've also been deeply involved in people's lives, and I've done miracles, and I think we take this literally, I've done miracles, I've been able to get into people's lives and liberate them and help them and see healing, so this person is deeply involved in ministry, and Jesus turns and says to him, what? I never knew you, not like, hey, I used to know, you used to be a Christian, what happened to you?

Not like I don't know who you are, there's never been a spiritual connection between us, where there's never been a personal relationship between us, and this is the tree with the bad fruit, now you starting to figure this out, the two ways are not good people and bad people, I don't know, because if you go back into the Sermon the Mount, you'll see Jesus is always contrasting to groups of people, but they're not people who pray and who don't pray, what was he saying? He says don't pray like them, pray like this, remember? Both groups are praying, or he doesn't say they don't give to the poor, you should know, he says they give to the poor, but don't give like they do, give to the poor like this, both groups are following the ten commandments, they'll shout not murder, remember?

Everybody's, they shout not murder, so they're both groups are living non-violently, but remember? He says you heard it says they'll shout not murder, but I say to you, Jesus says if you're a Christian you won't even look at people in your heart and say you fool, now what he's talking about, we put it in a nutshell, Jesus is not saying the real, real spiritual trick you might say, the real spiritual test, the real discernment, the real place you can be really stuck, it's really screwed up, is to mistake the good path of the bad path, no, the good life for an evil life, no, he is not contrasting good and bad people he's contrasting religious people and Christians, they're both behaviorally and their behavioral standards similar, they're both praying, they're both given to the poor, they're both obeying the ten commandments, you see, they're both being kind of their neighbor, on the outside, they're both sheep, but on the inside, there's utterly different reasons that they're obeying the ten commandments and with utterly different character results, that's amazing, and you see why, don't you see why? He says you're all anybody can see the difference between moral behavior and immoral behavior, between living a good life and living a bad life, what people can't see and what people both people inside the church and outside the church, people inside the church and outside the church are being smothered, in fact they're dying spiritually because they can't tell a difference between religion and Christianity.

Jesus is saying these two groups of people and they both are doing similar kinds of things, but for utterly different reasons on the inside, motivation and spirit, and with utterly different results in their character, what are the different reasons? Well think about that this way, let's take a look at the religious person, what is the reason the religious person gives the poor in praise and does, what are the reasons? Well again, I told you this is summarizing sermon, some of you are very smart, you only came today and now you're going to get the whole nine yards, you go back and you see for example, it says in chapter six verse two, it says religious people give to the poor, but why do they give to the poor?

For the poor? See they help the poor, but why do they help the poor? Do they help the poor for the poor?

No, chapter six verse two says, they do it to get honor from men. Well you say, doesn't everybody want a little pot in the back? Now listen, listen, listen.

The word honor is literally the word glory, it's the word docksah. Did you like our docksology today? You know that's, our docksology, which literally means the glory word, giving God glory.

You know, we sing it every week, you know, praise God from the most blessings flow, you know, and all that. And it's to the tune of the old hundredth. First we say all, all ye who are of tender heart for giving others to take your part.

Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son, and praise the Spirit, what is that? And especially today with the brass and the boy, glory. We're saying to God, you're glorious.

And yet this is what it's saying, religious people are people inside who have no sense of their own glory, no sense of their own weight. They have no sense of their own theirness, they have no sense of their own value, they have no sense of their own worth, they have no sense of their own self. And you know, it says that in verse 15, it says on the outside, their sheep, but on the inside, the old translation used to say, the old king James should say, they're ravening wolves.

The NIV says ferocious, but that doesn't really get at it. And here's why. One thing that's one of the, you can see why it's hard to be a translator of the Bible.

This particular word that they translate ferocious. If you look at every other place it's used in the New Testament, every other place, this Greek word has a very specific meaning. It means to blackmail somebody or to extort extortion or blackmail.

Now you can imagine if you're a translator you're coming along and you see what Jesus says here, how can you write it down? You know, it says, okay, watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they're blackmailing.

What inward black? What is that? I mean, that would be nonsense that they can't write it down, but it's not nonsense if you go back through and you think about this.

Why do they give to the poor? Why do they do what they do? Because inside they desperately need, desperately need, we desperately need, to assure ourselves that there's something worthwhile about us.

There's something significant. There's something weighty. There's something lasting.

There's something valuable about us. And what we're going to do is we're going to go out there and we're going to do good things and we're going to be good and we're going to help people and we're going to counsel people. We're going to help the poor.

We're going to rehab houses. We're going to do all that stuff. Why?

because we're going to make the world give us what we need. We're going to make people think I'm a good person. See, inwardly I'm incredibly empty, which means everything I do, as a religious person, everything I do.

I'm trying so hard to be an artist. I'm trying so hard to be a singer. I'm trying so hard to have a decent career.

I really want somebody to fall in love with me. And I want to have this great family. Why?

Are you doing your art for you? Yes. Are you falling in love?

Are you getting into friendships? What are you doing this for? Jesus says, because on the inside we lack this inner honor.

We lack this inner glory. As a result, everything we do is not about that. The art is not about art.

Your friendships are not about friendship. It's about you. You're out there.

And you're saying, I'm going to be good. I'm going to do this. And I'm going to do that.

And I'm going to get from the world. I'm going to make them give me what I most need. A sense that I'm more something.

Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer? Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith? For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding of what it means to follow Christ.

A great resource to start using this summer is the new city catacism devotional. God's truth for our hearts and minds. This devotional brings the historic catacisms of the Christian Church to life offering a question to consider for each week of the year.

In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catacases, the rich and communal practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers that frame the foundational beliefs of the Christian faith. Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer, and a brief meditation that will challenge and inspire you. The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller, and Kevin D.

Young, as well as historical figures such as Augustine, John Calvin, and Martin Luther. This month, in addition to the new city catacism devotional, we are including a great companion resource, the new city catacism for kids, as our thank you for your gift to help Gospel and Life share the hope of Christ's love with people all over the world. So, request your copies today at gospelandlife.com slash give.

That's gospelandlife.com slash give. Now, here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. And then when Jesus says, okay, how do they pray?

How do they pray? Why do they help people for the people now for themselves? And why do they pray for God?

No, it says in chapter 6, verse 7, they think they will be heard for their intense words. It's the same thing with God. Jesus says, religion is a power play.

It's a way of telling God what he has to do. It's a way of saying, because I'm living this life, you've got to give me a good life, because I'm doing all these things, because I'm being so good, become trying so hard, I'm trying so hard. It's so burdensome to be a religious person.

You're trying so hard. And then, why are you doing that? So God, I'll have to bless you.

So God, I'll have to give you the life you want. So God, I'll have to answer your person. So people will have to honor you.

So people will have to do good things for you. People will have to say you're a good person. To get all those things that deep inside, you don't have.

And Jesus says, that's the reason why. Since that's the reason why you're doing all these good things, that's your reason. The result is going to be, you're going to be a judgemental person.

You're going to despise people. You're going to look around at them and say you fool. You're going to be rigid people.

You're going to be heartless people. You're going to use your religion to feel better, to feel better than other people, and to exclude everybody emotionally or worse, who doesn't believe what you believe. You may be a very moral person, but your morality will be just like the beauty of a snowflake.

Perfect, intricate, symmetrical, and freezing. And Jesus says that Christianity is different. A Christian is doing all the same stuff for an utterly different reason, and with another utterly different result.

Look at the Christian. A good tree bears good fruit. Now you see, here's why religion is so stupid.

Religion always starts outside in. Religion says, if I do all these things, then maybe finally, that'll fill up the emptiness. If I go to church and I read my Bible, and if I give my, as Paul said, if I give away everything I have to the poor, if I give my body to be burned, because that doesn't have to profit you.

What are you doing? He says, you're working from outside in. Maybe then God will bless me.

Maybe then I'll finally feel decent about myself. But it doesn't work. It's silly.

That's why Jesus says, the fruit on the tree does not give the tree life. Can you imagine? Can the fruit give the tree life?

No, the fruit is a result of the life. The fruit is an outflowing of the life. And a Christian is someone who's got something inside, and it's the inside that affects.

It's the inside fullness, not an inside absence, that is the reason why you step out. There couldn't be a greater difference between Christianity and religion. There couldn't be a greater difference.

Because you see the religious person is doing all this stuff, trying to keep it up, working outside in. Because in a response to inner emptiness, but a Christian is someone who is doing what he or she is doing out of an inner fullness. We're going to get, because, you know, after this, this is the end of the sermon on the Mount, and this summer we're going to get into Jesus' model of spirituality.

We're going to talk about prayer. We're going to talk about the Lord's prayer in detail. And we're going to get to a passage, which is just an amazing passage to me.

We're going to get to it near the end of August. And it's a place where Jesus Christ in John 17, verse 22, is praying. He's praying about His disciples.

And He says, at one incredible place to His Father, He says, Father, I have given them the glory you gave me. You know what? Now, the glory, the glory we give God, sometimes is pretty good.

Both this morning and this evening, when we were singing the doxology, and the trumpets were blaring, and everybody was standing up with their eyes closed and singing God's glory, that's pretty good. That wasn't bad, not bad at all. I got goosebumps to you.

We're giving God glory. There's absolutely no way. There's no way that the kind of glory we can give Jesus is anything like the kind of glory God the Father can give Jesus.

Yet Jesus says, Father, these ones who believed in me, I'm giving them the glory you gave me. Now, I'm not waiting until at the end of their lives, if they've been very good little boys and girls, I'll let them into Kingdom of Heaven. I'm giving it to them now.

And a Christian is somebody who lives without assurance. A Christian is somebody who lives out of that. A Christian is somebody who has that who's adopted into that.

The difference in Christianity and religion couldn't be more different. Religion is not outside in, I mean, just that religion is outside in Christianity is inside out. Religion is saying, I give God a record, a good record.

And then that's my way of controlling God and everybody around me. The Christianity says, no, God through Jesus Christ gives me a perfect record and then I lose control as a result. I move out now into a life in a completely different way.

If you have that inner glory, if you know about that kind of assurance, if you know he looks at you like that. If you have that sense of inner lovedness and beauty and glory, if you've got that or to the degree that you've got that, you move out into art and why you do the art. It's about the art.

It's not about you. You move out into a friendship and why do you do the friendship. It's about the friend not about you.

Christians are not supposed to, at least to the degree that you know who you are, when you move into a friend, you don't get into a new relationship saying, how can I get this person to give me the things I most desperately need? How can I get this person to give me the acclaim I want? How can I get this person to give me the affection I want?

And that's really what's going on in our little brains within every single relationship because you see we're inwardly we're ravenous apart from Jesus. Now do you see how astounding this thing is? Now this is the first thing and somebody's looking at their watch.

I thought they were three. Yeah, but the first one is the big one and the other two are the solutions in a way to it. The first thing Jesus says is, you can't possibly find me without first losing your religion.

You must lose your religion if you're going to find me. You've got to give up religion if you're really going to have me because you see if you think you're after me when I'm going to show you right here, this is what this poor guy in chapter, in verse 21 is doing. If you think you're after me when you actually are using religion to do a power play with people and everybody around you and God himself, you're actually further away from me than the prostitutes and the pimps.

He says that, you know, Matthew 21, 31, he says to the religious leaders, the prostitutes and the tax collectors are getting into the kingdom of God ahead of you. They're closer. They understand the spiritual reality better.

They have a better idea of what they need and who they are than you do. You cannot possibly find Jesus unless you're willing to lose your religion. That's the first astonishing thing.

He says the real problem, the real problem in life. Spiritually speaking is to tell the difference in Christianity and religion because if you get into the church and you don't know the difference, you may find, and I know there are people like this who find Christianity. Well, every so often, I'll talk to somebody who says, I used to be a Christian.

I'm not anymore. And I said, what do you mean? I couldn't keep it up.

If you couldn't keep it up, I don't think you had it. You know, there's a hymn that I've heard quoted, but I've never found the hymn itself. So everybody says, where did you get it?

I heard it. Who wrote it? I don't know.

But it goes like this. It's exhausting, you see, to be a religion is exhausting. And that's the reason the hymn writer says this to us.

Lay your deadly doing down, down at Jesus' feet, stand in him and him alone, gloriously complete. Now somebody says, OK, how do I do that? Tell me, how do I do that?

Well, that's the other two astonishing things. The first astonishing thing, you see why they were astounded? That's the reason why these, look at these last two verses.

This isn't just a throwaway. This is the summary of the whole of this thermal amount. They were astonished why?

Because this is not at all what the teacher's the law were telling them. Not at all. He suddenly realized Jesus was saying, the biggest danger you have is to make mistake religion for Christianity.

Now the second astonishing thing in the third, and I'll be brief, really, the second astonishing thing is how he puts himself in the center. He puts himself utterly in the center and shows this poor person in verses 21, 22 and 23, what that means. You see, notice in verse 21, 22 and 23, what day is this?

It is not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, Lord, enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my father, who is in heaven. Many will say to me, on that day, no, wait a minute, what is this? This is a day, he just calls that day, and on that day we're figuring out who gets into heaven, what day is this?

It's judgment day. And oh my word, do you realize what he's saying? Who's the judge?

Almost casually, it's almost like he slipped it in. It's almost just like a slip in, what is Jesus claiming? He is saying on that day everybody's going to be coming to him.

He's the judge. Listen, everybody knows that only God can be the judge. Why?

Because you see, to be the judge of the world, to be the judge of a human being, you'd have to have infinite knowledge, to have the ability to judge, because unless you had infinite knowledge, how would you know what everybody deserved? And secondly, you'd have to have infinite goodness to have the right to judge, because if you didn't have infinite goodness, who are you? And Jesus very casually says, you know, you couldn't be the judge of the universe unless you were infinitely good and infinitely knowing and infinitely powerful, of course, too.

And Jesus very casually says, mm-hmm. Yeah, right. But you see, when they come to him, he puts himself utterly in the center because they come and they say, Lord, Lord, did we not?

Now, what's so fascinating about this person is this person is saying, I did everything in your name. I centered my life on you. Look carefully.

Look, he says, many will say to me on that day, Lord, Lord, didn't we prophesy in your name? Didn't we drive out demons and perform airing miracles in your name? Now, what are they saying?

Jesus, I did everything for you. Now, listen carefully. These are people who are absolutely saying, my whole life revolved around the church.

And he never knew them. My whole life revolved around the church. I was always teaching your word.

I prophesied in your name, which means I was teaching your message. I was lifting up, I was telling the stories about Jesus. And I was doing everything in your name.

I mean, everything was about me. Everything was about you, Jesus. Everything was about you.

But now look what he's saying. He's saying, you never knew me at all. Now, what's he saying?

Look at how they talk. Did we not? Did we not?

Didn't we do? On judgment day, these people come to Jesus and they're doing to Jesus what they've been doing with everybody else their whole lives. They're coming and they're demanding something of Jesus on the basis of their record.

That's what they're doing. Look at what I've done. And Jesus is saying that means everything was about you.

You never knew me at all. I wasn't even there. Now, how could that be, Jesus?

Everything was about you. No, but everything was for you. Everything was for you.

It was never about me at all. If you want to move from religion to Christianity, you have to take a look at the good things you're doing and realize that they're not in any way, not in any way, that you can't...you can't put it possibly, and think of how exhausting it is to think that you're going to somehow get God to give you what you want, because of all your good deeds. Jesus says, look at me.

Look at me. Jesus, look at Jesus. He's the opposite of a wolf.

He's a sheep through and through. He's a land that was slain. And when you see Him laying down His life for you.

For you, it'll fill you with the inner glory. Why would he do that? Well, what must he look, how must he think of you, how much must he love you?

And he gives you, then, when you believe in him, when you say, Father, accept me because of what Jesus says, Jesus says, I will give you the glory, my Father gave me. So the first thing you have to do is you have to see, you can be extremely busy for Jesus and not really be doing it for him at all. So it's sort of busy about Jesus, but not really doing anything for him at all because you're basically basing everything you do on your good works.

You're just, and that's the reason why you're always angry with God because he's not doing what you said he should do, but look at how, you know, think of all the poor, think of all the people, you know, in your class and you've been out of school for four years and think of all those people sleeping around and you've been good, and they're wise, you're going to hold up better than yours, does that ever occur to you? And if it does occur to you, how exhausting, the layer deadly doing down, down to Jesus feet, standing him in him alone, gloriously complete, the last astoundishing thing he says is this, and I think it's the most astoundishing thing. When he punishes somebody, what does he say?

Does he say, fire and brimstone for you, buddy? Does he say, hey, Sisyphus, would you please go over there and roll that stone up that hill? Now he says, depart from me.

Jesus Christ says that the only real punishment is to lose me, and we know what that must mean. If the ultimate nightmare is to lose Jesus, then it must mean it basically would everybody's greatest tragedies to lose Jesus, even the people who don't think they believe in him when they find they've actually lost him. So realize that this is the only real punishment there is.

And what does this mean? What tells you what it means? If this is the ultimate nightmare, it means that the thing that you've always been looking for, no matter who you are tonight, the love you've been looking for in every pretty face, in every sweet set of lips, in every embrace, the beauty you've been looking for in every piece of art, the beauty you've been looking for in every piece of music, the thing you've always longed for all of your life and everything you've longed, the thing you've wanted in all your warnings, the thing you've sought in all your seeking, the thing you've loved in all your love, basically just that it was me, whether you know it or not, you were after me, because you see, when you lose me, you'll find that you've lost everything.

And therefore he's saying, to whatever it takes to get me, to whatever it takes to send your whole life on me, it nothing is worth losing me, and behold, I invite you, come to me. Oh ye who labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest. Listen, there's some of you who are very, very weary and it's because to a certain degree you're forgetting that Jesus has given you the Father's glory.

It's one of the reasons why you're so weary. There's also some of you who've gotten very busy and very religious a few years ago when you had a crisis in your life and you wonder why, you have no prayer life. Some of you know this, some of you know you've been faithful, you've been obeying the tank of mammoths, you've been kind of going to church, you've been doing your duty, you may have been giving, but you know you have absolutely no prayer life at all.

You never experience intimacy in prayer life. See, Jesus says to this very busy guy, what does he say? We never had a personal relationship, we never knew each other.

And it could be that you're just religious and you're not a Christian at all. Because what you really did when you tried to give your life to God and you said, now I'm going to really try to live a good life, that's not going to make you a Christian. And don't forget, if you say, oh, I'm just too messed up, I'm too much of a wreck.

You don't know what I've done. Well, see, Jesus looks and says, it's actually the people who sometimes are the most irreligious and have been the furthest away from morality who often know who they are. That's why he was able to say the prostitutes and the tax collectors get into the kingdom of heaven before the religious person.

So you see, it doesn't matter how far away you are, it doesn't matter what you've done, you're nearer than you think. Let's pray. Father, we thank you that you've made it possible for us to read this astonishing and astounding sermon.

That the real danger, the real contrast is Christianity and good people. That Jesus Christ is not just the judge, but he's the center of everything. And the only thing we really, really will hurt us is if we lose him.

I ask that you would help us all apply this to our lives in different ways. Some of us need to hear it. Some of us need to hear this as a challenge.

Some of us need to hear this as a comfort. But regardless of what we need, we pray that your Holy Spirit will tailor it to us. We thank you that you're such a suitable Savior, Jesus.

You suit us. You always tailor your approaches to us so that they fit. You're seeking our love in such different ways, but we ask that you come and take it.

And we do our very best not open our hearts to you. We pray that during the rest of the service as we pray, as we sing, as we think, as we meditate, you'd really meet us. We want to stand before you.

**讲员**: 提摩太·凯勒 (Tim Keller)


欢迎收听《生命中的福音》播客。本月的节目我们将推出一系列关于登山宝训的内容，这是耶稣阐述如何真正活出基督徒生活的教诲集。在这个系列中，提摩太·基勒探讨了一个引人深思的观点：基督教不仅与世界不同，它还与宗教有着根本的不同。现在，我们已经通过了整个春天的时间，一起学习了登山宝训。

今天来到登山宝训的结尾部分，这是一个总结性的段落，也是整篇讲道的总结，因此耶稣在这里将他之前所说的一切汇聚在一起。因为这是对整篇讲道的一个总结，所以也成为了对我们这一系列讲道的一个总结，甚至可以说是整年的总结。因此，我想向今天第一次来参加我们教会活动的朋友表示祝贺，尤其是那些只是第一次来到“赎罪堂”的朋友，你们真是太聪明了！因为其他很多人花了数小时甚至数周的时间才弄懂登山宝训的内容，而你们却能在短时间内就理解了它的精髓。

这真是非常明智的选择。让我读给你们听，马太福音7章15到29节，这是整篇讲道的结尾部分。耶稣说：“当心假先知！他们来到你这里好像羊，但里面却是凶恶的狼。

你们从他们的果子就可以认出他们来。不是葡萄从荆棘里摘下来的，也不是无花果从蒺藜里摘下来的吧？同样，好树结好果子，坏树结坏果子；好树不能结坏果子，坏树也不能结好果子。凡不结好果子的树都砍下来丢在火里。

所以你们要从他们的果子认出他们来。” “不是每一个说‘主啊、主啊’的人都能进入天国，只有那些行我天父旨意的人才能进去。”“到那一天，许多人会对我喊：‘主啊！主啊！

我们不是奉你的名传道、赶鬼、行许多神迹吗？’那时我会明确地告诉他们：‘我不认识你们，你们这些作恶的人，离开我去吧。’所以，凡听见我这话就去行的，好比一个聪明人把房子建在磐石上。” “雨来了，洪水涨起，风吹来，猛烈地刮着那座房子，但房子没有倒塌，因为它根基稳固在磐石上。

”“凡听见我这话却不照着去行的人，好比一个愚昧的人把房子建在沙土上。雨来了，洪水涨起，风也吹打，房子倒塌了，倒塌得很大声。” 当耶稣说完这些话时 好的，这是上帝的话语。登山宝训的麻烦在于它太熟悉了。

它是英语中最熟悉的材料之一，甚至可以说是全世界历史上最熟悉的材料之一——喜乐的应许、以眼还眼、爱人如己等等，因为太过熟悉，几乎没有人真正去听。几乎没有人真正明白它的意思。我们怎么知道这一点呢？因为在登山宝训的最后一部分，马太福音提到了一件几乎被忽略的事情，你可能会说：“哦，是这样。

”但实际上这非常重要，因为它是一个测试，是你能否理解耶稣在登山宝训中所说内容的试金石。看，第28节，这里就是测试，这就是如何知道的方法。当耶稣说完这些话后，群众对他的话感到震惊不已。这个词不是普通的希腊词，它意味着震撼、惊愕。

有趣的是，我读到的一些评论家也提到，这里的动词使用了不完全式，这是一种罕见的用法。换句话说，**这意味着人们被震撼到了，他们惊愕得不知所措，并且随着时间的推移，他们的震惊感越来越强烈，感到更加惊讶，而不仅仅是少数人，而是整个群众。**这是当耶稣讲登山宝训时，人们的普遍反应。你是否也被震惊了？

你是否感到惊愕了？但你说：“我知道这些，我了解它们。” 如果你没有被震惊，那说明你并没有真正听进去。让我们来听一听吧。

基本上有三大点耶稣所说的内容是极其令人惊讶的，而且我的猜测是，即使你对登山宝训非常熟悉，你也可能从未听到过这三点。这三点与耶稣在登山宝训最后所说的有关：有两种方式，两种基本的精神选择。我想要你们区分这两种方式，并且确保你们选择了正确的那一种，而不是错误的那一方。有两种道路，所以首先他说有两条道路，其次在文章结尾提到这两种道路的尽头有一个评判者，然后在判决之后有一句判词。

在这三种事物的末尾，他都说了非常惊人的事情。现在让我们看看它们是什么。他首先说关于这两条道路的一些令人惊讶的事情。这两大道是什么呢？

请注意，我们从第15节开始讲这个布道内容。如果他从第13节开始讲，就像我没有在传单上写的那样，那里写着有两条路，一条通往生命，一条通往死亡。然后这里说有两种树，一种结好果子，一种结坏果子。到了第24节，又提到了两种房子，一种建在磐石上，一种建在沙土上。

所以耶稣在这里说的是这两种精神上的途径，两种道路，并且我希望你们能够区分它们并选择正确的那一条。但其中最重要、最有趣的一点是，这两条道路很难分辨彼此，非常难以分辨。请注意，这里并没有说有两棵树，一棵结果子，一棵不结果子。这并不需要太多的分辨能力。

如果你在六月走进一个果园，看到一些树上有叶子，另一些树上既有叶子又有果实，那么哪棵是结了果实的呢？显然，那些既有叶子又有果实的树就是结了果实的，而旁边没有叶子、也没有果实的那棵树显然是枯死的。各位不需要成为火箭科学家，只需要动动脑筋，就能分辨出哪一棵是活的，哪一棵是死的。耶稣并没有说这两条道路或两条路径中一条有无果子的树，另一条有结了果子的树。

注意第16节和第18节的内容：你们要凭他们的果子来认出他们；坏树不能结好果子。我们谈论的是两棵树，它们都结了果子。但其中一棵树，坏的，不是指干瘪的，而是指有毒的。这两棵树看起来一模一样，一颗结毒果，或者两座房子从外表看完全相同，肉眼所见都是相同的，只有内在的区别才重要。

那么，这两种道路是什么？这两种方式又是什么呢？每个人自以为知道答案，而我以前也这么认为，因为我之前讲过这个主题，但其实错了。因为几乎所有人都这样理解：耶稣说的就是好人和坏人，就是顺从上帝的道路和违背上帝的道路。

登山宝训告诉你如何做一个好人，在第五章他说要爱人如己，在第六章他说要施舍给穷人，要祈祷，主祷文，所以登山宝训告诉你要怎样过一种好生活，而到了最后耶稣说这里有两条路，两棵树，两个房子，你可以选择遵行登山宝训，过一种好的生活，或者过一种邪恶自私放荡的生活。但这真的是他要说的吗？一个人是祈祷者和教会成员，另一个人不是，要分辨出来需要多少洞察力呢？不需要太多，这里是一个祈祷者和教会成员，另一个不是；一个对邻居礼貌，另一个却打伤甚至刺死他的邻居，要分辨这些真的需要很多洞察力吗？

耶稣会把这两种道路比作外表完全相同的树或房子吗？不，耶稣并不是在谈论好人与坏人。你可以从他给出的两个例子中看出这一点：两个关于坏树的人类例子。首先他说要提防假先知，他们披着羊皮，但内心却是凶残的狼。

看啊，“羊”是一个普遍的旧约和新约中的术语，指的是上帝的子民，我是牧人，我就是羊。所以这里的意思是说，这些是先知，也就是讲道者、教师，但他们外表像羊，至少在我看来，并不是怀疑论者，也不是无神论者，更不是放荡的人。现在这些人是谁？首先，他们称耶稣为主，这一点所有注释家都同意。

**这意味着这个人是说你是神，你是神圣的。**在希腊文旧约中，“主”这个词（Kurios）实际上是用来翻译旧约希伯来原文中的上帝名“耶和华”的，也就是说，这个人在对耶稣说话时，明确表示你就是上帝的儿子，我信道，我相信基督的人位联合，我相信基督的两性论，我相信你是上帝的儿子，我相信你的神性，我相信所有的教义。所以这里是一个正统信仰的人，完全接受所有教义。其次，他不只是说“主”，而是说“主 主”，这是一种希伯来语结构，用来表达情感强度。

如果你真的有感情，你不会只是说“亚所法”，你会说“亚所法 亚所法”；不是“玛丽”，你会说“玛丽 玛丽”；不是“玛莎”，你会说“玛莎 玛莎”。换句话说，这是强烈的情感表达。这个人来的时候，并不只是说我相信你是上帝，他不只是说了“主”，而是说了“主 主”，**这意味着他对耶稣充满情感，非常激动。**情况变得更糟了，他说我在你的名里作过预言，这至少意味着我教导圣经，传达耶稣的信息。

然后说我还深入参与人们的生活中，做了奇迹，帮助人们得到释放和医治，所以这个人是积极参与事工的。耶稣转过身来对他说：“什么？我不认识你！”意思是他从没见过这个人，不是“嘿，以前我们是基督徒”，而是完全不认识他。

不像我不知道你是谁，我们之间从未有过灵性的连接，也从未有过个人的关系，这棵树结的果子不好，现在你开始明白了。两条路并不是好人和坏人的问题，我不确定，因为如果你回到登山宝训中去，你会发现耶稣总是对比两组人，但不是祈祷者与不祈祷者，他怎么说的？他说不要像他们那样祈祷，要这样祈祷，记得吗？两组人都在祈祷，或者他没有说他们不去施舍穷人，你应该知道，他说他们是施舍给穷人的，但是不要像他们那样施舍，要这样施舍，记得吗？

两组人都遵守十诫，他们会喊‘不可杀人’，记得吗？每个人都在喊“不要杀人”，所以两方都非暴力地生活着，但记得吗？他说你们听见了，他们说不要杀人，但我对你们说，耶稣说，如果你是基督徒，你连在心里都不准看别人为愚昧。他所说的，我们可以用一句话概括：耶稣不是在谈论**真正的、真正的灵性考验或辨别，真正的困境，真正的问题，并不是**把好的道路误认为是坏的道路，而是把好的生活误认为是邪恶的生活。

他并不是在对比好人和坏人，而是在对比宗教徒和基督徒。他们的行为标准看起来相似——都在祈祷，在帮助穷人，遵守十诫，对邻居友善，从外表看都是羊。但内心深处，他们遵循十诫的原因完全不同，性格结果也截然不同，这真是令人惊讶！你明白为什么吗？

他说人们都能看出道德行为与不道德行为的区别，能区分过着好生活和坏生活的人，但人们却看不见、无法分辨宗教和基督教之间的区别，实际上，无论是教会内还是教会外的人都在精神上被窒息，甚至走向灭亡。耶稣说这两群人，他们所做的事很相似，但内心动机和精神状态却完全不同，结果也大相径庭。那么这些不同的动机是什么呢？让我们这样思考：先来看那些自认为虔诚的人，他们为什么施舍给穷人呢？

经文第六章第二节提到，虔诚的人会帮助穷人，但他们为什么要这么做呢？是为了帮助穷人吗？不，第六章第二节说，他们这样做是为了从人那里获得荣耀。你可能会问，难道不是每个人都想得到一点点肯定吗？

听我说，听我说，听我说。“荣耀”这个词实际上是“荣光”的意思，是docksah这个单词。今天我们的docksology怎么样？你知道我们今天的docksology实际上就是“荣光之词”，是为了给神带来荣光。

我们知道，每周我们都唱这首歌：“赞美主，恩典的泉源涌流。”它以《百灵歌》为曲调。第一句是：“凡有柔心肠的人，都来分担施舍的责任。” “赞美天父，赞美圣子，赞美圣灵”，这是什么意思？

特别是今天有铜管乐和童声合唱“荣耀”时，我们在对神说：你是光荣的。然而经文却说，虔诚的人内心深处并没有自己的荣光感，没有自己的价值感，没有自己的重要性，也没有自我意识。第六章第十五节提到，他们外表像羊，但内心却是狼。> 你心里若充满荣耀感和自我价值，你的行为就会完全不同。

> 耶稣说：“你们要小心，不要外面作光作亮给人看，里面却黑暗无光。” NIV 里说凶猛，但这个词语的意义并不仅仅如此。这里有一个原因。这个词在新约其他地方出现时，都有一个非常特定的意思——勒索或敲诈。

如果你是翻译者，在这里看到耶稣所说的这句话，你该怎么写呢？比如，耶稣说：“要防备假先知，他们来到你这里如同羊羔外面披着狼皮，里面却是凶猛的。” “内心凶猛？”这到底是什么意思？

如果直接翻译成这样，确实显得很荒谬。但如果你仔细思考这个词语在其他地方的意义，就不会觉得荒谬了。为什么他们会施舍给穷人呢？他们为什么会这样做？

因为他们内心深处需要证明自己是值得的——有某种重要的、重大的、持久的价值。我们所做的每一件事都旨在让世界看到我们的价值。我们会去做善事，帮助人们，为穷人提供援助，修复房屋，这一切都是为了什么？是为了让人们认为我是好人。

你看，我的内心其实非常空虚，**这意味着我做的一切，作为宗教信徒来说，我所做的一切： 我努力成为一名艺术家，努力成为歌手，努力拥有一份体面的工作。**我真的希望有人爱上我，也希望拥有一个美好的家庭。为什么要做这些呢？耶稣说，这是因为我们内心缺乏内在的荣耀和光辉。

因此，我们所做的每一件事都不是为了那个目的。艺术不是为了艺术本身，而是为了其他目的。您的友谊并不是关于友谊，而是关于您自己。您就在那里。

而您在说：“我要变得更好。我要这样做。我要那样做。” 我要从这个世界得到什么。

我要让他们给我我最需要的东西——一种感觉，感觉自己有价值。这个夏天，您是否希望在信仰上有所成长？或者您希望帮助新信徒或孩子们理解基督教的核心信仰？对于很多人来说，夏季可以提供更多的机会来深化我们的信仰和对跟随基督意义的理解。

今年夏天开始使用的一个很好的资源是新的城市灾难灵修手册。**这是上帝对我们心灵和思想的真理**。这份灵修手册通过让基督徒教会的历史性灾难生动起来，为一年中的每一周提供了值得考虑的问题。在引言中，提摩太·凯勒阐述了灾难问答的重要性——这一丰富而集体的学习和记忆问题与答案的做法构成了基督教信仰的基础信念框架。

每周包括一段经文、一篇祷告和简短的沉思，这些都会挑战并激励您。附带的注释由当代牧师如约翰·派博、提摩太·凯勒和凯文·德等撰写，以及历史人物如奥古斯丁、约翰·加尔文和马丁·路德。年轻的朋友，在这个月，除了新的城市灾难灵修手册之外，我们还为您准备了一份很好的配套资源——新的城市灾难儿童版，作为您向福音与生命事工捐赠礼物的感谢。所以，请在今天访问 gospelandlife.com/slash-give 请求您的副本。

那是 gospelandlife.com/slash-give。现在，提摩太·凯勒将完成今天的教导。当耶稣说：“好吧，他们如何祷告？” 他们是如何为别人而不是自己祷告的？

为什么他们会为上帝祷告？正如第6章第7节所说，他们以为自己的祈祷会因为话语激烈而被听到。同样的道理也适用于上帝。耶稣说，宗教就是一种权力游戏。

这其实是在告诉上帝他必须做什么。这是在说，因为我过着这样的生活，你得给我一个好生活；因为我做了这么多事情，因为我如此善良，我努力了这么久，所以你必须赐福于我。你这么努力。那你为什么这么做？

为了让你的上帝给你祝福。所以上帝就得给你想要的生活。所以上帝就得回应你的祈求。人们就得尊敬你。

人们就得为你做好事。人们就得说你是好人。而这一切都是你内心深处所没有的。耶稣说，这就是原因。

既然你做这些好事的原因是这样，那就是你的理由。结果就是，你会成为一个审判者。你会鄙视别人。你会环顾四周说：“你是个傻瓜。

”你会变得固执。你会变得无情。你会用宗教来让自己感觉更好，比其他人更优越，并且情感上排斥那些不认同你信仰的人。你可能是一个非常有道德的人，但你的道德就像雪花一样完美、精致、对称，却冰冷刺骨。

耶稣说，基督教不一样。基督徒做同样的事情，但原因完全不同，结果也完全不同。看看基督徒。好的树结出好果子。

现在你看，这就是为什么宗教如此愚蠢的原因。宗教总是从外向内开始。宗教说，如果我做了所有这些事情，或许最终能填满内心的空虚。如果我去教会，读圣经，如果我把保罗所说的全部财产都捐给穷人，甚至把自己奉献给火刑，那对我不一定有什么好处。

你在做什么？他说，你是在从外向内努力。也许这样上帝会祝福我。也许这样我终于会对自己感到满意。

但这不起作用，这是愚蠢的。这就是为什么耶稣说，树上的果子不能赋予树生命。你能想象吗？果实能给树带来生命吗？

没有，果子是生命的产物。果子是生命的一种流露。基督徒就是内心有东西的人，是内心的这种状态影响了他们。不是因为内心的空虚才去行动，而是因为内心的充盈。

基督教和宗教之间有着天壤之别。这种区别是如此巨大。你看，宗教徒在做这一切事情，试图维持下去，他们在外面努力。因为他们是在回应内心的空虚，但基督徒则是出于内心的一种满溢去做事。

接下来，我们要进入耶稣的灵性模式，开始讨论祷告，详细探讨主祷文，并且会到达一个对我来说非常神奇的段落。我们会在八月底到达那里，在约翰福音17章22节，耶稣在为祂的门徒祈祷。他说：“父啊，我将你所赐给我的荣耀，给了他们。”你知道吗？

有时我们给予上帝的荣耀其实也挺不错的。今天早上和今晚晚祷时，当我们唱赞美诗、号角声响起、大家闭着眼睛高声歌唱上帝的荣耀时，那真的很不错。我们向神献上荣耀，绝对没有一种方式可以与父神给耶稣的那种荣耀相提并论。但耶稣说：“父啊，所有相信我的人，我都把你的荣耀给了他们。

”不是等到他们去世后表现得非常优秀才进入天国，我现在就给他们这种荣耀。基督徒就是那些生活在不确定中的人。基督徒是出于这种状态生活的人，他们是被接纳进来的那种人。基督教和宗教之间的区别截然不同。

宗教是从外到内的，也就是说，宗教是从外向内进行的；而基督教则是从内向外的。宗教说：“我给上帝一份记录，是一份良好的记录。” 然后这就是我控制上帝以及周围每一个人的方式。基督教则说：不，通过耶稣基督，上帝给了我一份完美的记录，结果我失去了控制，开始以一种完全不同的方式生活。

如果你有这种内在的荣耀感，如果你了解那种确定性，如果你知道祂是这样看待你的。如果你有那种内在被爱的感觉、美丽和荣耀，如果这些你都有了或者至少有了其中的一部分，那么你就会开始走向艺术，并且思考为什么你会创作艺术。这并不是关于你自己；而是要通过艺术来表达。它不是关于你。

你也会开始走向友谊，并且思考为什么你会建立这种友谊。这是为了朋友而不是为了自己。基督徒不应该——至少当你真正了解自己的时候——在进入一段友谊时，想着如何让这个人给你提供你最迫切需要的东西？如何让他们给你带来赞誉？

如何让他们给你带来关爱？实际上，在我们每一个关系中，这就是我们在内心深处所做的事情。因为我们如果不依靠耶稣，内在的饥饿感是无法满足的。现在你看出来这有多惊人了吗？

这是第一点，有人在看表。我以为还有三分钟。是的，但第一点是最关键的一点，而后面的两点则是解决这个问题的方法。耶稣首先说：你不可能找到我而不先失去你的宗教信仰。

如果你要真正找到我，你就必须放弃你的宗教信仰。因为你如果以为自己是在追求我，而实际上却在利用宗教来操控他人和周围的人以及上帝本身，那么你离我比妓女和嫖客还要远。他说，在马太福音21章31节，耶稣对那些宗教领袖说：妓女和税吏比你们先进入神的国。他们更近了，他们更明白属灵的真实。

他们比你们更清楚自己需要什么、自己是谁。除非你愿意放弃你的宗教信仰，否则你不可能找到耶稣基督。这是第一个令人惊讶之处。他说，生活中**真正的问题，从灵性上讲，是**区分基督教和宗教之间的区别。

如果你进了教会还不知道这个区别，你可能会发现一些人找到了基督教。但每隔一段时间，我都会遇到这样的人说：“我曾经是一个基督徒，但现在不是了。”我说，“那你是什么意思？你坚持不下去了吗？

” 如果坚持不下去，那可能你就没有真正拥有它。你知道有一首赞美诗被引用过，但我从未找到这首诗本身。大家都问：“你从哪儿听到的？”“谁写的？

”我不知道。但歌词是这样的：成为宗教是令人筋疲力尽的，这就是为什么作曲者对我们说： 放下你的致命行为，放在耶稣脚前， 站在他里面，仅在他里面，荣耀地完整。有人会问：那我怎么做到呢？告诉我，我怎么做？

这也是另外两个令人惊讶之处。第一个令人惊讶之处，你们知道他们为什么会感到惊讶吗？这就是为什么这些最后两节经文如此重要。这不是随便说的，而是整段话的总结。

他们为什么会感到惊讶？因为这完全不是老师所教导的内容。他突然意识到耶稣在说：最大的危险是把宗教误认为基督教。第二个令人惊讶之处在于，他在第三部分中如何把自己放在中心位置，并且在21、22和23节中向这个可怜的人解释了**这意味着什么。**

你看，在21、22和23节中，这一天是什么日子？不是每个人都会对我说：“主啊，主啊”，就能进入天国。只有那些行我天父在地上旨意的人，才能进去。许多人在那一天会说：“主啊，主啊，我们不是在你的名里赶鬼，在你的名里行了许多异能的事吗？

” 那是审判日。我的天哪！你们有没有想过他在说什么？谁是那个法官？

耶稣几乎是不经意地提到了这一点。他几乎只是顺口一提：耶稣到底在说什么呢？他说在那一天，所有人都会来找他。他是那个法官。

请注意，只有上帝才能做这个法官。为什么呢？因为你看，要评判这个世界、评判一个人，你必须拥有无穷的知识和能力来判断，否则你怎么知道每个人该得什么？其次，你还必须有无穷的善行才有资格评判，因为你不是谁，凭什么评判别人？

耶稣很随意地说：除非你是无限地好、无限地知、无限地强，否则你无法做宇宙的法官。耶稣很随意地说：“嗯哼。”是啊。但你看，当他们来找他时，他已经把自己完全置于中心位置了，因为他们会说：“主啊，我们不是在你的名里赶鬼，在你的名里行了许多异能的事吗？

” 这个人的惊人之处在于，他说自己的一切都围绕着你展开。仔细看看。他说：许多人在那一天会说，“主啊，主啊，我们在你的名里预言过，在你的名里驱逐过邪灵，在你的名里行过许多神迹。”他们到底在说什么呢？

耶稣，我为你做了这一切。现在，请听清楚。这些人绝对是在说，我的一生都围绕着教会。而他却根本不认识他们。

我的一生都围绕着教会。我总是教导你的道。我在你的名里预言，也就是在教导你的信息。我传讲耶稣的故事，并且一切都为你做。

我意思是，一切都是关于我的。一切都是关于你，耶稣。一切都是关于你。但现在看看他在说什么。

他说：“你们根本不认识我。”那他又在说什么？看看他们说话的方式。我们不是这样做的吗？

我们不是这样做的吗？我们不是这样做吗？在审判日那天，这些人来到耶稣面前，对耶稣所做的，就像他们一生中对其他人所做的那样。他们来要求耶稣做某事，基于他们的记录。

这就是他们在做的事情。看看我做了什么。而耶稣说**这意味着一切都是关于你。**你们根本不认识我。

我甚至都不在那里。那么，耶稣怎么会这样说呢？一切都是关于你。不，但一切都是为你。

一切都是为你。这从来都不是关于我的。如果你想从宗教转向基督教，你必须审视一下自己所做的好事，并意识到这些事情根本不能……根本不能让你认为你能让上帝因为你的好行为而给你想要的东西。耶稣说：“看看我。

” 看看耶稣。他是狼的反面。他彻头彻尾是羊。他是被杀的羔羊。

当你看到祂为你舍弃自己的生命时， 对你来说，这会充满内心的荣耀。为什么他会这样做？那么，他必须如何看待你，如何思考你，又有多么爱你呢？然后，当你相信耶稣时，当你对天父说：“父啊，请接纳我，因为耶稣这样说。

” 耶稣说：“我要给你我的父给我的荣耀。” 所以首先你需要明白的是，你可以非常忙碌地为耶稣做事，但其实并不是真的为了他。所以你看似在忙于耶稣，但实际上并没有真正为他做任何事情，因为你基本上是基于你的善行来做一切。——— 注意：这里的翻译尽量保留了原文的语气和情感，并且使用了适当的标点符号来增强文本的可读性和流畅性。

你本是公义的，因此总是对神感到愤怒，因为祂没有按照你说的方式行事。但想想看，在你的班级里，有多少人已经四年没上学了；想想那些四处游荡的人们，而你一直守规矩、明智，你觉得你会比他们过得更好，这难道从未出现在你的脑海中吗？如果真的如此，那该是多么的疲惫，一层又一层地降下来，最终站在耶稣脚前，单单依靠祂，祂是完全且荣耀的。祂最后说的一句话是：“离开我。

”我认为这是最惊人的话。当祂惩罚某人时，祂说了什么？祂会不会说：“火与硫磺等着你吧，伙计？”或者“嘿，西西弗斯，请去把那块石头滚上山吧。

”现在祂说的是：“离开我。” 耶稣基督说，唯一的真正惩罚就是失去我。我们都知道**这意味着什么。**如果终极的噩梦是失去耶稣，那么对每个人来说，失去耶稣可能是他们最大的悲剧，即使那些自认为不信祂的人，在发现已经失去了祂时，也会意识到这一点。

这又意味着什么呢？它告诉你什么？如果这是终极噩梦，那就说明你一直在寻找的东西——无论你是谁——那就是你在每一个美丽面孔、每一双温柔的嘴唇、每一次拥抱中寻找的爱；是你在每一件艺术品、每一段音乐中寻找的美。你一生所渴望的一切，你警告过的一切，你寻求的一切，你爱的一切，基本上就是我。

不管你是否意识到这一点，你都在追求我，因为你看，当你失去我的时候，你会发现你失去了所有一切。因此，他要说的正是：无论需要什么来得着我，无论需要你整个生命都奉献给我，没有什么比失去我更值得。看哪，我邀请你们，来到我这里。你们中间劳苦担重担的人，我必使你们得安息。

听我说，你们中有许多人非常疲惫，这是因为你们在某种程度上忘记了父神已经赐给你们耶稣的荣耀。这就是你们感到疲惫的一个原因。还有一些人几年前经历了一次生命中的危机，变得非常忙碌、非常宗教化，现在却不知道为什么失去了祷告的生活。有些人知道这一点，有些人知道自己一直忠心顺服，去教堂做礼拜，履行职责，可能还一直在奉献，但你知道自己完全没有祷告生活。

你从未在祷告中体验过亲密的关系。耶稣对那个非常忙碌的人说了什么？他说：“我们从来没有建立过个人关系，彼此也不了解。” 也许你们只是宗教化了，并不是真正的基督徒。

因为当你试图把生命献给神，说现在我要真正地活出好生活时，这并不能使你成为基督徒。别忘了，如果你说：“我太糟糕了，我已经是个彻底的失败者。”你以为自己一无是处。但耶稣看着你说：“实际上，那些最不宗教化、离道德最远的人往往知道自己是谁。

”因此他能够说妓女和税吏比那个自认为很虔诚的人更先进入神的国。所以你看，无论你有多远离，无论你做过什么，你其实比你以为的要近得多。让我们祷告。父啊，我们感谢你能让我们读到这篇令人惊讶又惊人的讲道。

**真正的危险在于基督教与好人的对比。耶稣基督不仅是**审判者，更是万事的中心。如果我们失去他，这才是唯一真正会伤害我们的事情。我祈求你们帮助我们每个人以不同的方式在生活中实践这一点。

有些人需要听到这些话，有些人需要将其视为挑战。有些人需要从中获得安慰。但无论**我们需要什么，我们都祷告求你的圣灵能为我们量身定制。**感谢你是一位合适的救主，耶稣。

你是适合我们的，总是以最适合的方式与我们互动。你用不同的方式寻求我们的爱，但我们祈求你能来到我们中间，让我们敞开心扉接受你。在剩下的礼拜中，无论我们在祈祷、歌唱、思考还是冥想时，我们都希望你能真正遇见我们。我们渴望站在你的面前。
