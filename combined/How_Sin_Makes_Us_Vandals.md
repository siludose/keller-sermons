# How Sin Makes Us Vandals / How Sin Makes Us Vandals

## Chinese Translation / 中文翻译 / English Transcript

Welcome to Gospel in Life. Some people say the fundamental problem of the world is poverty. Others say it's bad systems, poor education, or biology, but what if none of these can fully explain the brokenness we see, both in the headlines and in our own hearts?

In today's teaching, Tim Keller looks at how the Bible's teaching on sin gives us a deeply honest and yet incredibly hopeful view of the world. Turn to a part of your bulletin where you have the passage on which the Scripture is based, and we're starting this week a new series, and it's on sin and there's nothing more fundamentally relevant and practical than to understand the answer to the fundamental human question, what's wrong with us? If you're trying to raise a family or run a corporation or if you have political or community involvement and if anything you do in this life, you need to have a working theory of an answer to that question, what's wrong with us?

Why the selfishness, the cruelty, the corruption, the crime, the racism, the injustice? Why? Where does it come from?

Now the Bible's answer is ancient and it's profound and that is sin in the human heart. One of the reasons why it's so widely rejected, I believe, is actually because what's not understood is that the biblical understanding and doctrine of sin is multidimensional. All of us understand or remember, I think they understand what the Bible says about sin.

We say yes, we know what the Bible says about sin. Sin is breaking God's law and therefore we're guilty and condemned, yes, I know what the Bible says, but that's only one. In fact, that's the last of the aspects of sin that we're going to look at in this series.

I think one of the reasons why sin as an answer to the reason to the problems of our life is tends to be widely overlooked by people is because we don't understand the multidimensionality than how nuanced, how rich, see, how multi-perspectival the biblical teaching on sin is. We're going to look at the first of those dimensions today and we're going to read a passage of scripture that I can almost proudly say, it's very possible and very likely that even if you've gone to church all of your life, you've never heard anybody so stupid as to try to preach a sermon on this text. This text is almost never preached on, I've never preached on, it's almost never studied.

It's the end of the book of Judges and one of the reasons why nobody knows what to do with it, why it's there and so but nobody ever tries to speak about it is because it is so inexplicably boring. Judges 17 versus 1 to 13, it's just the beginning of a story and I'll tell you how it ends. You don't need to know.

Now a man named Micah from the hill country of Ephraim said to his mother, you know the 1100 chequels of silver that were taken from you and about which I heard you order a curse? I have that silver with me. I took it.

And then his mother said, the Lord bless you my son and when he returned the 1100 chequels of silver to his mother she said, I solemnly consecrate my silver to the Lord for my son to make a carved image and a cast idol. I will give it back to you, O Lord see. So he returned the silver to his mother and she took 200 chequels of silver and gave them to a silversmith who made them into the image and the idol and they were put in Micah's house.

Now this man Micah had a shrine and he made an effort and some idols and installed one of his sons as his priest. In those days Israel had no king. Everyone did as he saw fit a young Levite from Bethlehem and Judah who had been living within the clan of Judah left that town in search of some other place to stay and on his way he came to Micah's house in the hill country of Ephraim and Micah asked him, where are you from?

Oh I'm a Levite from Bethlehem and Judah he asked he said, and I'm looking for a place to stay then Micah said to him, live with me and be my father and priest and I'll give you 10 chequels of silver a year your clothes and your food. So the Levite agreed to live with him and the young man was to him like one of his sons and then Micah installed a Levite and the young man became his priest and lived in his house and Micah said, now I know that the Lord will be good to me since this Levite has become my priest. Now let me tell you what we have here.

One of the reasons why people ignore this section or really find it kind of confusing is this, up to now everything in the book of Judges has been extremely interesting. Book of Judges is a history of Israel after they came into Canaan, they had been led there by Moses and Joshua out of Egypt and they came into Canaan and what we have in the book of Judges the first 16 chapters is a series of fascinating stories because over and over the people would slide into sin and when they slide into sin they soon became enslaved by some foreign power and then over and over again 12 times actually in the book God sends a judge which is really a deliverer. You mustn't think in terms of a magistrate or someone sitting at a bench.

A judge was a deliverer, essentially a savior and the judge would come and turn the people bet away from sin back to God and liberate them from the military oppressors and it was always fascinating. I'm very dramatic and some of the most famous people. We have Gideon here, we have Deborah here, we have Samson in this book and it's always thrilling and exciting to see the salvation come, they're saved you see.

But then when you get to chapter 17 to chapter 21 there's these last five chapters and they're very, very hard to understand because they don't seem to be about anything. There's no judges in here, there's no salvation that comes, God hardly shows up in some ways. And what's so intriguing is that there's two incidents.

In chapter 17 and 18 we have one and you've read half of it and in chapter 19 to 21 you have the other and the first one we've already read and what do we see here? Well first of all we see three, if you're going to give this story a title and it couldn't be a very interesting title because it's not a very interesting story, it's a bunch of trivial people doing kind of dumb, weird things. I could call it Micah, Mom and the Levite.

And what you have is you have these three people, first all you have Micah, cheating his mother. And then giving her the money back when she hears him, idling a curse against the robber whoever it is and he says, well you know I'm, I did it, I robbed and I was kind of scared when he's, you know he's not very good or very bad, I mean how good can you be to rob your own mother but then how bad could you be to get, you know give it back, you know kind of, gee I'm scared, you cursed, I wonder. And then so you see Micah, cheating his mother, then you see his mother cheating God because if you notice when she's really excited she says I will give it all back to the Lord.

I'm so happy about this, I'm so happy my son came back and did all, he says I solemnly constrict my silver, all I give it back but when she actually came to it she only used 200 checkers and she makes two images, two idols out of silver and puts them in in a sense her son's chapel where he worshiped the Lord. In complete contradiction to everything God says anywhere, right in the tank of maim, it's all through the law of Moses where he says you mustn't make images, you mustn't make idols. So first we have Micah cheating mom, then we have mom cheating God and then along comes the Levite.

And on what's his point? Well Micah and his mother decided they were going to have their own shrine. See in those days there was a tabernacle, a sanctuary, a place where God said worship me here and it was at Shiloh.

And in that tabernacle there was an effort that was the breastplate of a priest, that the priest wore and had stones on there through which God spoke to people. There was an effort and there was a priest and the priest had to be Levites, they had to be on the tribe of Levi. And there was a sanctuary where people could come and pray and worship.

But Micah and mom, they wanted to have their own sanctuary, they wanted to have their own place of worship. And so they made one of their sons, mom's grandson, Micah's son, a priest until along comes the Levite and Micah says, wow, I can have a genuine Levite here, just like in the law of Moses. So he says how much would you know be willing to work for this amount and Levites says, sure, fine.

And so now he says, boy, now I've really got a Levite, I've got an effort, I've got everything I want. Except in chapter 18, and this is how the story ends, a group of men come along, Danites, they're trying to find a new place to live. And they say to the Levite, you come with me, come with us, we'll pay you more.

And bring those images along, which, of course, were worth quite a bit of money. And so Micah comes running out saying, you stole my Levite, you stole my images, what are you doing in the Danites? I'd say, go home or I might hurt you.

And so he did. And that's how the story ends. And then in chapter 19 to 21, suddenly, at the very end of the book of Judges, we're completely unprepared.

After all these boring people doing all these trivial things, we're completely unprepared for what happens. There's a gang rape of a woman that leads to not just civil war between the tribes of Israel, but genocidal destruction of whole towns and villages down to the infants. And what's so strange about this, again, no judges, no salvation, no nothing, now what's going on here.

Now, on the one hand, this is terrible storytelling. Now when I say terrible storytelling, I don't mean I think this was just made up, but you see this incident was chosen out of this whole period of history. Why?

Why was it chosen? When I say it's a bad story, first of all, in a good story, you have to somebody, some character, who you get engaged with, that you care about, you have to have some character that you're concerned about, otherwise it's just a terrible narrative. And nobody here you care about, see, they're all, none of them are very good or very bad.

They're very shallow. They're very uninteresting. They're boring, they're very unprincipled.

They don't stand for anything. And not only that, there should be some kind of crisis, right, that's resolved. But the crisis that there is only crises that come about because they're so shallow and uninteresting and boring and unprincipled, why is this here?

And why would this be in front of this horrible story that comes right after? Well, it began to dawn on me, and it's dawned on other people. I'm not the only one who knows this or understands this, please.

There's no judges here, isn't this interesting? Every other part of the book is about God's salvation, and what the author is showing us, and therefore what God's showing us, is what we look like without a salvation, what we look like without Him, what we are in our natural state. In other words, this is showing us the nature of sin.

And this right away actually shows us some things that are very, very surprising to us. If you live in this society, you've got some, how do I say stereotypes about what you think the Bible teaches about sin and about evil. And this goes right against it.

Look, real briefly, because we're going to the Lord's table today, and we're going to have a series. Look, real briefly, let me show you. This tells us what sin does to us, what sin does to God, and how we can be cured of it.

What sin does to us, what sin does to God, and how we can be cured of it. And every one of them is surprising. The first one, what sin does to us.

What do you think sin really does to you in its advanced stages? What does sin really do to the human heart? What does it do to the character?

Most of us believe that most of us are kind of regular people. Of course, we sin, of course, to air is sin and to air is human and so on. But when we think of people who are really diabolical, really, really advanced in their evil, we think of evil geniuses.

We think of the people in all of the action films as terrible, those charming, those witty, but those diabolical, those cruel. That's not at all what the Bible says. When Hana Arant went to the trial of Adolf Heichmann, the Nazi butcher, she was shocked by what she found.

And she wrote an essay that really got a lot of flak. She wrote an essay on what she called the banality of evil. Now banal is a word that basically means common.

It means run of the mill. And she looked at this guy and she says, anybody could have done this must be a monster, but when she saw him, she realizes this isn't a monster. First of all, she found he was a boring little man.

He spoke in clichés, no insights, really very little sense of humor. And he had the absolute run of the mill, like all the rest of us, desire to be important, desire to be liked, ability to kind of, you know, not think about things that are unpleasant. And she wrote and she said, he wasn't a monster, he was just like all the rest of us.

He was boring and superficial, and uninteresting, and shallow. And people got very upset with her. And they said, you can't say that, anybody can do this, this man, anybody can do this cannot be like us.

And Hannah aren't got it partly right, but partly wrong, at least according to the Bible. Because she said, because he was so banal and superficial, it led him to do evil. But the Bible says it's evil that leads you to be banal.

The most advanced, the most prominent, the most characteristic, effective sin on the human heart is not to make us bad but boring. There's nobody that said it better than C. S.

Lewis, of course, and actually I've got a number of his quotes that helped me with this sermon. He says, I am really upset with the most pernicious of all the literary images of evil. It's Gert is Mephistopheles in Faust.

The humorous, civilized Mephistopheles strengthens the illusion that evil is liberating. But the real mark of hell is a sleepless, unsmiling concentration upon the self. You must understand hell as a place where everyone is perpetually concerned about his or her own dignity and advancement, where everybody always has a grievance, and where everybody lives in the deadly seriousness of envy and self-importance.

Here's another section, in preface to Paradise Lost Lewis as this, to admire Satanist to give one's vote for a world of lies, propaganda, and incessant autobiography. At the choice as possible, hardly a day passes without some slight movement toward it in every one of us. Sin in each of us is something that once just to be petted and admired, to take advantage of other lives.

It especially wants to be left to itself. It wants to keep well away from anything better or stronger higher than it. Anything that would make it feel small, but unimpeded, sin will exploit the whole universe if it could.

Now, here's what Lewis is saying. Here's what Hannah Arnt saw at least partially. Here's what we're being told.

Why in the world would this be considered, a case study of human beings without God? Why not something more awful? Why not something more cruel?

Why not something more like the last part of the book? What is this about? And the answer is what Lewis says.

The most interesting, advanced sin makes you boring because all you're ever worried about is how you're doing, how you look, how things are affecting you. There's always agreements incessant autobiography. You can never get out of yourself.

You're always feeling sorry for yourself. And you know what's so weird about this. You say, ah, that's not like Jack Nicholson is the Joker in Batman.

I mean, there's evil. You know, no. Sin makes you mediocre.

The most advanced sin makes there's nothing more boring than somebody's always worried about how you look. Sin makes you these very uninteresting, unprincipled, shallow, boring people. It's pretty interesting.

There's an article called the Culture Zone Column in the New York Times Magazine today about the tremendous popularity of one, you know, one-person shows. Have you seen that? Or they just get up and they stand up there and they talk about their lives and they talk about their stories and they talk about everything, one-person shows.

And virtually everybody knows it's sort of an open secret even though it keeps going that the vast majority of people are just boring. The vast majority of people, those one-person shows, tell you way too much. This is what the line says in the article, way too much about people that you have no desire to know.

Why are people so uninteresting when they just simply talk? They're not part of a story when they just say, here's how I feel. Here's what's on my mind.

It's sleepless, unsmiling concentration on the self. That's the essence of sin. And the first thing we see here is that what sin really does is not make you bad before it makes you boring.

That's the primary thing, incessant autobiography. But that's the first surprising thing. But the second surprising thing is, like, in a way more seminal.

It's in the Bible when sin ruins you. It's because already your attitude toward yourself is always based on your attitude toward God. Your understanding of yourself is always based on your understanding of God.

Your emotions toward yourself are always based on your emotions toward God. Because what we have here is just as surprising. It tells us what sin leads us to do toward God.

What does sin lead us to do? How does sin lead us to regard God? Now, again, most people would think that advance sin would make you an atheist.

That's advanced. We have a lot of those advanced sinners right around New York City, actually a pretty surprising number. High percentage that don't want any other city in the country.

People say, I don't believe in God. And maybe you're one of those. I don't know.

You know, somebody brought you here out of curiosity. Maybe you're one of those. Well, I got good news for you.

Atheism is not the essence of sin at all. Here's what we're told. Says, I dedicate to the Lord these two images.

Boy, that's terrible. Doesn't she know what the 10 commandments says, the first commandment? They'll shout, not worship any other gods.

Doesn't the first commandment say, I should have no other gods before me? Why is she making those idols? Doesn't she know?

Why would she worship other gods right there in front of God, right in his shrine, you see? And the answer is, she's not worshiping other gods. Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache.

We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way? And what can be done about it?

Listen, there's plenty of gods named in the book of Judges. The Canaanites had the bales and the asterisks and the Philistines had dagon and the Syrians had Rimon and the Mowbites had Kimosh, but she doesn't say I'm going to make an Isle of Kimosh, she didn't make a bale, she didn't make an asterisks, she didn't make a Kimosh, she had a dagon of Rimon. What did she make?

Who are these images of? Well, they're the ones in whose name they're dedicated. These are images of God, these are images of the Lord God, these are images of Yahweh the God of Israel.

What she has done is not she hasn't, she hasn't worshipped another God and she's not worshiping no God, she's worshipping a reduced God. She has whittled God down, she has made him, she has put a handle on him. This is a God you can put in your purse.

This is a God you can take places with you. This is a God who's manageable, this is a God who's tame and this is the heart of sin. A little God, a manageable tamed God will make you a little manageable, controllable person.

Is it? Han Ahren said the scary thing was that banal person was capable of unbelievable terror and evil under certain circumstances. And the point at the end of the book of Judges is banal people caused by sin, sleepless un, sleepless concentration on the self, unsmiling, humorless, therefore boring.

Incessant autobiography makes you feel so sorry for yourself that you are capable of terrible things eventually. All of our problems come in essence from whittling God down, Psalm 50 verse 21 talks about it, when God looks at the people and he doesn't say you've rejected me, he doesn't even say you're worshiping other gods, what does he say? He says you thought this is songs 50 verse 21, you thought I was like yourself.

And this is the essence of sin. We are sure God has got to be like us. We're going to whittle them down to our size, let me give you some examples of how we do it.

The only few, Kathy said please keep it at about 30 because we were sitting and talking about him. I began to realize, well this is the essence, look number one, first of all we think God's like us and we think he can be bought. Some of you have started coming to church, started reading your Bible, started cleaning up your life because you say I need strength, I need inspiration, stop it.

Well, wait a minute, shouldn't I read my Bible, shouldn't I pray? Should I live a good life, shouldn't I come to church, isn't that what God wants? Well, he said all depends on why you're doing it because here's what I'm afraid, almost always the way we, when we move toward God, our hearts are filled with this and therefore we always in the beginning start like this.

We think God can be bought, we think God can be impressed. And the reason we start cleaning our life up is what? So we can say, and here's the essence of sin, now God has to be good to me because I'm doing everything right.

See, Michael was so happy that he knew he was out of compliance with his own son as a priest. He realized what the word of God said, but oh, wait a minute, I can get a leave, I'll leave it. Now surely God will be good to me, he's obeying, but why is he obeying?

To get control of God, to buy him, highly religious people who are absolutely sure that God has to be good to you, God has to answer your prayers, God has to bless you, God has to give you a good life, God has to give you the spouse of your dreams, why? Because I'm doing everything right. Now the Lord has to be good to me, what have you done?

You put a handle on God, you're trying to control God, you whittled him down, you think he's like you, they can be bought, they can be impressed, he can't be. And by the way, there's nothing they'll make you more boring than making you a smug self-righteous religious person, nothing, they're the worst kind. Little God creates little people.

Secondly, we think God's like us because, you know, it can be bought, secondly, you think God's like you because you don't think he's any wiser than you are. Do you know why we're so scared so often, why we're so angry because things aren't going right? Do you know why so many of you have walked away saying, I cannot believe in a God who would let this happen and this happen and this happen.

What are you saying? What are you saying? What you're saying is because I can't think of a good reason for this to have happened, there can't be one.

Now, when you say, I can't believe in a God who would let this happen, you simply have pulled him down, you said, he couldn't be wiser than me, well, not what? How acidized is that intellectually? You know, to say, if you believe there's a God big enough to have caused this, then you've got to believe there's a God who's big enough to have some reason for it bigger than you, that you wouldn't know.

You can't have it both ways. You can't be mad at God because you acknowledge He's more powerful than you, but then you will let Him be more wise than you. I mean, that's just, and yet we're so bitter in our soul and we're so cast down all the time.

Why? Because we just don't believe God. You believe I'm like you, He says.

You have whittled me down. You've made me into an image something controllable. You've revised me.

You've edited me. You've pulled me down. You know, Elizabeth Alleya, who often quote, when she, there was a book she wrote years ago about her husband and a number of other women's husbands were killed in the jungles of South America as part of their missionary work.

It's called Through the Gates of Splendor, and many years later, it was reissued in a kind of silver anniversary edition, and she wrote an epilogue to it, and this is what she said in it, and it just slammed me. She says, people asked me, what did you learn from all that? What did you learn from your husband, the love of your life being killed when you had a little baby girl and you'd only been married for two years?

What did you learn? And this is what she said. I have reflected on all that happened to me, and one thing, one thing is pointed out, quote, if he is God, he is worthy of my worship and my service, and I will find rest nowhere, but in his will, and that will is infinitely immeasurably, unspeakably beyond my largest notion of what he is up to.

The one thing I learned is if he's God, I will find no rest anywhere but in his will, and that's true of everybody in the face of this earth. They'll never be freedom in your heart unless you are willing to admit that his will is infinitely immeasurably, unspeakably beyond my largest notion of what he's up to. Let me give you a couple more.

We think he's like us in math, in other words, we think he can be bought. Secondly, we think he is like us in his wisdom, therefore, we can't think of something. If we get no worries up to them, he can't be up to anything good.

Thirdly, we think he's like us in our scale. Scale, I got this from Kathy late last night. She's been reading the series in the New York Times Science section on what we're learning about the galaxies.

Now listen, you know this, you know, stuff like this. The distance from the earth to the sun, 93 million miles, was reduced to the thickness of a piece of paper. Then the diameter of just this galaxy would be a stack of paper, 310 miles high.

And our galaxy is just one of gazillions and gazillions of galaxies just in our cluster. Our galaxy relates just to the cluster of galaxies. The way a single grain of sand would relate to all the beaches on the entire and all the sand and all the coasts of Florida, that's how many galaxies there are.

And that's just in our cluster. And even from the moon, you can't see us, we're going to expect from the moon. And yet the Bible says that if there is a God, think about this, he holds the world together.

He holds it all up with the word of his power. The entire universe is like a contact lens on his little finger. Now, do you say to somebody like that, please come into my life to be my assistant?

Do you say to somebody like that, don't call us, we'll call you? Do you say something like that? Well yeah, I might deal with you after I've had a little fun.

I've moved to New York City after all. Do you say, well, I'll be happy to believe in you if you give me a complete explanation for all of my questions. You've forgotten the scale.

You think I'm like, you are da, you know, the audacity of it, give you another one. You know racism is, racism is, it's taking cultural differences and I'm viewing them with moral significance. Let's just say, listen, white racism isn't the only kind of racism, but it's pretty prominent.

So let me pick on us white people, all right, for a second. Okay, what do white people do? They, especially what do northern European types do, you know, us with the background, you know, British or German and all that.

We see these ethnic groups and they're much more emotional. So when they're happy, they're more emotional and when they're sad, they're more emotional. What do you feel when you see that?

You say, this sort of lost it haven't they kind of, you know, they're different, but you deepen your heart, have assigned moral superiority to your difference and moral inferiority to their difference. And they're going to do the same thing. I know that, but here's the point.

What is white racism? It's saying, my God is white. My God is like me.

God is white. That's exactly what Psalm 50 verse 21, you thought I was like, you, everything comes from that. All of our doubts, all of our anger, you see, all of our self-righteousness.

I'll give you another one, you think God is like you in his attitude toward time. You know, when God sees time, he sees it all at once. If you were high up over the earth, he would look down at the Mississippi River and all parts of the Mississippi River would be equally visible, right?

If you're down on the Mississippi River, you only see your bend. Now, a lot of you are saying, oh, years ago, yes, I did this and yes, I did this and yes, I did these things, but you know, they were bad, but you know, I've gotten over it. Certainly God wouldn't hold that against me.

My friends, God's attitude toward God is the very, the thing you remember way in the past, he is seeing now. He's still happening right in his nostrils. This is the reason why God has got of justice.

This is the reason why God never gets over anything. This is the reason why there has to be atonement, there has to be punishment. And when you say, well, you know, why, I can't believe in a God who judges, you think he's like you.

You think that because of the terrible things you've done and at the time you felt dog on guilty and it hurt a lot of people, but now it's been a year, it's been two years, it's been ten years, it doesn't bother you anymore. We thought I was like you. All of our problems come from this.

Because God, our God has become little, we've made him little, we've made him manageable, we get rid of the things that we don't like. Oh, I can't believe in this anymore, I can't believe in that anymore. We've whittled him down as a result.

We've been whittled up, there's no greatness to us, there's no freedom. Do you realize if you really accepted the God that Elizabeth always talking about, a God who is infinite, his will is infinitely and measurably beyond anything you can ever, any notion of what he's up to? If you said, I accept that, I embrace that, you'd be free, totally free, nothing can bother you anymore.

If you said, I'm not trying to obey God so He'll be good to me, so He'll give me the things I want, so He'll give me the status, He'll give me the marriage, so He'll give me the things I want. Instead, if you said, but He said, not I'm going to use Him to get the things that give me meaning in life, but that He is my meaning in life. If you really made Him your meaning in life, if He was the ultimate instead of just a little means to an end, something you've learned how to handle in order to get what you want.

If He was your meaning in life, in other words, if He was big, you'd be big. If He was great in your eyes, you'd be a great heart. You would walk through life greatly, you wouldn't be scared and upset and circumstances beating you around all the time.

This is the reason why there's this one little place in the Narnia Chronicles, those fairy tales by C. S. Lewis.

It goes by so fast that you just don't even notice its significance, but it's so incredibly interesting. It's where little Lucy meets Aslan, who's Jesus. He's a lion, and she meets him in the second book, and she says, Aslan, at last, welcome child.

He says, Aslan said, Lucy, you're bigger. That's because you're older, little child. Not because you're bigger?

No. The bigger you get, the more you grow, the more you'll find me bigger. Now, what does He say?

It goes by so fast, you don't even stop and think about it, Pilates. Lewis is saying, the bigger your God is, the bigger you will be. The more you let God be God, the more you make Him not a means to an end but the end.

Not someone has to answer your questions. The more you put Him on His proper scale, the more of a great heart you will be. Well, how?

How is it possible? How in the world? And you know what?

The normal thing for Christian to do, and I'll tell you, over the years, I used to end my sermons here. I used to say, now what? I know.

I've got sermons like this from the past. I've been looking at them over the last couple of weeks. I would say study the attributes of God.

Think of His holiness. Think of His majesty. Think of His wisdom.

Don't whittle them down. Except everything the Bible says about it. What is this commandment where He says, do not make a graven image of me, He says.

And what He's saying is, don't imagine me to be what you want me to be but worship me as I am. So what does it mean? Except what He says.

But you know what? When I study, when I just study His holiness, when I just study His majesty, when I just study His wisdom, I don't feel, I'm not getting greater, I'm not getting bigger. It just starts to crush me and it'll crush you.

This thing that has on saying to Lucy, I don't sense that dynamic at all, it just makes me feel worse and worse and worse. It's like, oh my word, this is God but I'm going to have to just put up with it. But the answer is this, in verse 6, it says, the reason for all this was there was no king.

Do you see that? It says, the reason all this idiotic, idiocy, the reason all this smallness in those days Israel had no king. Now what is the author saying?

He says, there's no savior. We need something better than these judges. We need a king.

But when you get to the king, even the best king, David, we see that he needed a savior. And what we're being pointed to is simply this. Why is it that God said no image?

Why is it that Israel was the only religion on the face of the earth at that time? It's the first religion, almost invented it. That if you went into this temple, you went into the holy of Holies, into the inner sanctum, and you even went to the ark of the covenant, which is the throne of God.

There was the cherubim, the angels, facing inward, and right where you expect to see an image, something palpable, something you could grab hold on, something accessible, right? We're physical beings, we have, we have, we taste touch here, see smell, we have senses and we want to see something, we want to feel something. And right there, there's nothing.

God says, don't you, they're putting an image there. My throne is empty. Can you say how my word is that it?

We have to put up with an abstract invisible God, a God we can't touch, God we can't see here, or smell, and God says, no, no, no, no, don't you dare put an image there, but not because there never will be one. In Colossians chapter 1, verse 15, we read something amazing, he is the image, Jesus Christ, is the image of the invisible God, for by him all created, all things were created, whether the thrones or powers or rulers or authorities. Now here's what God is saying, God is saying, I understand why you want an image.

I understand why you want something you can grab hold on, and I will give you something. I will supply the image, don't you supply the image because any image you try to make me, make of me, to make me something you can relate to will only make me tinier and smaller and it will make you smaller. But I will give you the true image, a living image, the Lord Jesus Christ, and he will so reveal my glory that on the one hand he will be someone you finally can relate to a human being a person, someone who loves and who weeps and who embraces, finally someone who is successful but somebody who actually makes me in your mind greater than you could imagine.

Not smaller but greater, why? Because this great God, you know, before whom we are nothing but specks, we are nothing but specks of dust, we are nothing but paramecium, we are nothing but amoebas. No other image could possibly have told us what this image does and that is he came to die for us, he died for the paramecium, he died for the amoebas.

When you have a God that is so big that he could become small, you got a bigger God than you could have imagined. No other religion has such a God, no other religion admits that God is so big he could have become small. Only when you have a God like that, only when you admit that Jesus Christ is the image of God that he died for me, that is what finally shows me a greatness beyond anything I would know otherwise but it is not a greatness that crushes me.

Now I want to live for him. Now I don't say, now God has got to be good to me because I am obeying all the rules because Jesus is my goodness. He is the thing.

I would want more than that, he is my meaning in life now. You see God can't be bought but we can. The bigger he gets, the bigger we will get.

Let's pray. Father, we know that one of the reasons for the Lord's supper is it is something physical. It is something we can put in our hands and it reminds us that you have put Jesus Christ on the earth to be our image, image of you, our way of understanding your greatness.

It is only as we receive him, as we remember what he has done, that you finally take in our minds your proper proportions and when that happens we will be so free. We pray, Lord, that you will make yourself real to us and your proper proportions as we take the Lord's supper as we take the bread and the cup. Be yourself in our eyes, be yourself in our hearts, be yourself so we can finally be ourselves.

What you have made us to be in Jesus' name we pray, amen. Thanks for listening to Tim Keller on the Gospel Unlife Podcast.

欢迎来到《生命中的福音》。有些人说，世界的根本问题在于贫穷。另一些人则认为是糟糕的制度、落后的教育或生物学因素，但如果我们看到新闻头条和我们内心深处的问题，这些是否能完全解释这一切？今天，提姆·凯勒将带领我们一起探讨圣经中关于罪的观点，这为我们提供了一个既诚实又充满希望的世界观。

请翻到你们圣礼单上有关经文的部分，本周我们将开始一个新的系列——关于罪的主题。理解这个问题的答案——我们到底哪里出了问题？——是极其重要且实际的。无论你是要抚养家庭、经营公司，还是参与政治或社区活动，甚至是你生活中所做的任何事情，都需要有一个有效的理论来回答这个问题：我们究竟哪里出了问题？

为什么自私、残忍、腐败、犯罪、种族歧视和不公正现象会存在呢？为什么会这样？圣经的答案是古老的，也是深刻的——罪根植于人的内心。我认为它被广泛拒绝的原因之一是因为人们没有充分理解圣经中关于罪的多维度解释。

我们都记得或知道圣经对罪的看法。我们说：“是的，我们知道圣经怎么说罪。罪就是违背神的律法，所以我们有罪并且受到谴责。” 是的，我知道圣经怎么说的，但这只是其中的一个方面。

事实上，在这个系列里，我们将探讨罪的所有方面，而那个关于违背神律法的观点实际上是最后一个。我认为人们往往忽视罪作为生活问题答案的原因之一，是因为我们没有理解圣经中关于罪的教导有多复杂、多细腻和丰富。今天我们将探讨这些维度中的第一个，并阅读一段经文。我可以自豪地说，这段经文几乎从未被牧师讲过，即使你一生都在教堂里，也很可能从未有人尝试以此为题布道。

这段经文几乎从不被讲解，我也从未讲解过它。这段经文出自《士师记》第17章1至13节，只是故事的开头，我将告诉你结局，你不需要知道。从前有一个名叫米迦的人住在以法莲山地，他对母亲说：“你知道那些一千一百舍客勒银子吗？就是有人从你那里偷走，并且你还咒诅了那个人？

”“我有那银子。”他母亲回答，“主必赐福与我的儿子。” 然后她把银子还给了米迦。米迦的母亲说：“我要将这银子归给耶和华，为我儿子铸造一个雕刻的偶像和铸成的偶像。

我把它还给你，耶和华见证吧。”于是米迦把银子还给他母亲，她拿了一千舍客勒银子交给匠人，他用这些银子做了雕像和神像，放在米迦的家中。米迦有一个圣所，并且制作了一些偶像，立他的一个儿子为祭司。那时以色列没有王，各人都按着自己的心意而行。

有一个年轻的利未人从伯利恒犹大支派中出来，在犹大家族中住了一段时间后，他离开那城寻找其他地方居住。当他经过以法莲山地米迦的家时，米迦问他：“你从哪里来？” 哦，我是伯利恒和犹大的利未人，他问我说。他说：“我要找一个住的地方。

”米迦对他说：“你同我住在一块儿吧！作我的父与祭司，我就每年给你十舍客勒银子、衣服和食物。”于是那利未人就同意同米迦住在一块儿了；那青年人在他家里就像自己的儿子一样。米迦便安置了那个利未人为他的祭司，在他家里住了下来。

米迦说：“现在我知道耶和华待我好，因为这利未人成了我的祭司。”现在让我告诉你们这里发生了什么事。人们常常忽略这一段或觉得它很困惑的原因是这样的：到目前为止，《士师记》中的所有内容都非常有趣。《士师记》记载的是以色列人在摩西和约书亚带领下从埃及进入迦南地之后的历史，前16章中有一系列引人入胜的故事，因为人们一次又一次地陷入罪恶之中，而当他们犯罪时，很快就会被外邦人奴役。

然后上帝会一次次地差派士师来拯救他们。你不要以为士师就是法官或坐在法庭上的那个人。士师实际上是一个救赎者，一个拯救者，他会带领人们远离罪恶回到上帝面前，并从军事压迫中解救他们。这总是非常迷人。

我非常戏剧化地描述了一些最著名的人物：我们有基甸在这里，我们有得示在这里，我们也有士师记中的参孙，看到这些拯救总是令人激动和兴奋。但是当你读到第17章到第21章时，你会发现最后五章的内容非常难以理解，因为它们似乎什么都没有。这里没有士师，也没有任何拯救发生，上帝几乎不出现。最引人注目的是，这里有两件事情。

在第17章和第18章中，我们读到了一半；而在第19章到第21章，另一半内容也在等待着你们。我们已经读过了前一部分，那么在这里我们看到了什么呢？首先，如果要给这个故事起个标题，那标题肯定不会太吸引人，因为这并不是一个有趣的故事，而是一些琐碎的人做了一些愚蠢、奇怪的事情。我可以用“米迦、妈妈和利未人”来命名它。

在这一系列人物中，我们先看到的是米迦欺骗了他的母亲。当他的母亲得知这件事后，他咒骂了那个强盗（无论他是谁），说：“我知道是我干的，我抢了我的母亲，当时我还挺害怕。” 他既不算是个好人也不算是个坏人——你很难想象一个会抢自己母亲的人能有多好，但又不得不承认，为了把钱还给母亲，他确实有点胆小。接着他说：“妈妈，你咒骂了我，我是不是应该有点儿害怕呢？

”于是我们看到米迦欺骗了他的母亲，然后他的母亲又欺骗了上帝——当她激动地说到儿子回来了，并且说要把所有的钱都献给耶和华时，她说：“我太高兴了，我的儿子回来了，他把所有的东西都还给了我。” 他说：“我郑重起誓，我把银子全还给了母亲。”但当她真正行动起来时，她只用了200舍客勒，并用这些银子做了两个偶像，放在她儿子的“神殿”里，供他崇拜耶和华。这完全违背了上帝在摩西五经中所说的任何地方都不能做偶像、不能立偶像的规定。

接着我们看到米迦欺骗了他的母亲，然后他的母亲又欺骗了上帝，之后利未人出现了。那么，作者想要表达什么观点呢？显然，米迦和他的母亲决定要建立自己的神殿。要知道，在那个时代，有一个圣所，一个地方是上帝说的：“在那里敬拜我。

” 那个地方就是示罗。在那会幕中，有一个祭司的胸牌，是神与人沟通的媒介。祭司需要佩戴它，并且上面有宝石，透过这些宝石，神向人们说话。祭司必须来自利未支派，他们属于利未人。

那里还有一个圣所，人们可以去祈祷和敬拜。但是米迦和他的母亲想要有自己的圣所，有自己的崇拜场所。于是他们让米迦的儿子，母亲的孙子，成为祭司。直到后来来了一个利未人，米迦说：“现在我可以有一个真正的利未人了，就像摩西的律法中所说的。

” 于是他问：“你愿意以这样的工资工作吗？” 利未人回答：“当然可以。” 就这样，米迦心想：现在我终于有了一个真正的利未人，有了祭司，拥有一切我想要的东西。然而，在第十八章，故事在这里结束，一群男人——但支派的人——来找他。

他们说：“你跟我来吧，我们会给你更多的报酬。” 并且还带着那些价值不菲的偶像。米迦跑出来喊道：“你们偷了我的祭司，偷了我的偶像，你们在干什么？” 我会说：“回家去，否则我可能会伤害你们。

” 于是他们离开了。这就是故事的结局。然后，在第十九章到第二十一章中，书末部分完全出乎意料。经历了这么多乏味的人做着琐碎的事，我们突然面对的是一个女人被轮奸的故事，这导致了以色列各部落之间的内战，并且整个城镇和村庄都被彻底摧毁，连婴儿也不放过。

如此令人震惊的情节，却没有任何法官、救赎或任何东西来解释这一切。从一方面来说，这是糟糕的叙事技巧。当我提到糟糕的叙事时，并不是说我认为这个故事是虚构的，而是说这个事件被选中出现在这段历史时期的原因是什么？为什么选这段呢？

当我说这是一段糟糕的故事时，首先，在一个好故事里，你必须有一个角色，一个你能够产生共鸣的人物，一个你关心的角色。否则，它就是一个糟糕的叙事。而这里没有一个人是你会关心的，他们都很平庸，既不特别好也不特别坏。他们很浅薄，毫无趣味性，无聊透顶，毫无原则可言。

他们什么都没有坚持。不仅如此，故事中还应该有一些危机，对吧？这些危机最终能够得到解决。但这里的危机只是因为他们太浅薄、无趣、无聊和没有原则才产生的，为什么这段话会在这里出现？

而且为什么会出现在这样一个糟糕的故事之后呢？渐渐地，我开始意识到这一点，并且其他人也有同样的看法。我不是唯一一个知道或理解这一点的人，请注意。这里没有法官，不是吗？

这很有趣。整本书的其他部分都在讲述上帝的救赎，而作者向我们展示的东西，也就是上帝向我们展示的东西，就是我们在没有救赎、没有祂的情况下是什么样子，也就是我们的自然状态。换句话说，这段话揭示了罪的本质。它立刻就告诉我们一些非常令人惊讶的事情。

如果你生活在这样的社会里，你对圣经关于罪和邪恶的教导有一些固有的看法。而这段话恰恰与这些看法相反。请稍作简要回顾一下，因为我们今天要去领主的晚餐，并且将有一系列的内容。请稍作简要回顾，让我来展示给你看。

这段话告诉我们罪对我们、对上帝做了什么，以及我们如何能够治愈它。罪对我们做了什么，对上帝做了什么，以及我们如何能够治愈它。每一个点都非常令人惊讶。第一个点，罪对我们做了什么。

你觉得在罪的晚期阶段，罪真正对你做了什么？罪对人类的心灵做了什么？它又怎样影响了你的品格呢？大多数人都认为自己是普通的人。

当然，我们都会犯错，毕竟人非圣贤，孰能无过。但当我们想到那些极其邪恶、真正达到恶的顶峰的人时，我们会想到邪恶天才。我们会想到电影中的反派角色，他们迷人而机智，但又极其邪恶。圣经却说并非如此。

汉娜·阿兰特在旁听纳粹刽子手阿道夫·希姆莱的审判时，被她所看到的一切震惊了。她在一篇文章中提出了“平庸之恶”的概念，这篇文章引起了很大的争议。这个词语的意思基本上是普通的、常见的。她观察这个人后说：“任何人都能做这样的事，他应该是个怪物。

”但她见到他后意识到，这并不是一个怪物。首先，她发现他是一个无聊的小人物，说话老套，缺乏洞察力，几乎没有幽默感。他对重要性有绝对的渴望，希望被喜欢，并且能够不去思考不愉快的事情。她在文章中写道：“他不是怪物，他和其他人一样。

”他很无趣、肤浅、乏味和空洞。人们对此非常不满，说：“你不能这么说，任何人都能做这样的事，这个人不可能像我们一样。”汉娜·阿兰特说得对又不对，至少根据圣经来说是这样。因为她认为希姆莱之所以如此平庸和肤浅，才导致他做了邪恶的事。

但圣经却说，是邪恶让你变得平庸。人类心中最先进、最突出、最具特征的有效罪恶，并不是让我们变坏，而是让人变得无趣。C.S.刘易斯说得最好了，当然我这里也有一些他的名言帮助我准备这次讲道。他说：“我真正不满的是文学作品中最为有害的形象之一，那就是《浮士德》中的梅菲斯特。

” ### 讽刺而文明的靡非斯特强化了邪恶是解放的幻象。但地狱的真实标志是一个人永无止息、面无笑容地专注于自我。你必须理解，地狱是一个每个人都在不断关注自己尊严和进步的地方，在那里每个人都怀有怨言，每个人都生活在嫉妒和自视甚高的死板严肃中。### 在《失乐园》中，路易斯以讽刺的态度赞赏撒旦主义者，并让人投票支持一个充满谎言、宣传和无休止的自我叙述的世界。

几乎每一天，我们都不可避免地向那个方向迈出一小步。在我们每个人心中，罪恶是一种曾经被宠爱和赞美、利用他人生活的存在。### 它特别希望独处。它想远离任何比它更好、更强或更高的东西。

任何让它感到渺小但不受阻碍的事物，罪恶都会利用整个宇宙来实现。### 现在，让我们看看路易斯说了什么。至少部分地，汉娜·阿恩特也看到了这一点。这就是我们被告知的真相。
