## 米迦、妈妈和利未人 / Micah, Mom, and the Levite

Now a man named Micah from the hill country of Ephraim said to his mother, you know the 1100 chequels of silver that were taken from you and about which I heard you order a curse? I have that silver with me. I took it.

And then his mother said, the Lord bless you my son and when he returned the 1100 chequels of silver to his mother she said, I solemnly consecrate my silver to the Lord for my son to make a carved image and a cast idol. I will give it back to you, O Lord see. So he returned the silver to his mother and she took 200 chequels of silver and gave them to a silversmith who made them into the image and the idol and they were put in Micah's house.

Now this man Micah had a shrine and he made an effort and some idols and installed one of his sons as his priest. In those days Israel had no king. Everyone did as he saw fit a young Levite from Bethlehem and Judah who had been living within the clan of Judah left that town in search of some other place to stay and on his way he came to Micah's house in the hill country of Ephraim and Micah asked him, where are you from?

Oh I'm a Levite from Bethlehem and Judah he asked he said, and I'm looking for a place to stay then Micah said to him, live with me and be my father and priest and I'll give you 10 chequels of silver a year your clothes and your food. So the Levite agreed to live with him and the young man was to him like one of his sons and then Micah installed a Levite and the young man became his priest and lived in his house and Micah said, now I know that the Lord will be good to me since this Levite has become my priest. Now let me tell you what we have here.

One of the reasons why people ignore this section or really find it kind of confusing is this, up to now everything in the book of Judges has been extremely interesting. Book of Judges is a history of Israel after they came into Canaan, they had been led there by Moses and Joshua out of Egypt and they came into Canaan and what we have in the book of Judges the first 16 chapters is a series of fascinating stories because over and over the people would slide into sin and when they slide into sin they soon became enslaved by some foreign power and then over and over again 12 times actually in the book God sends a judge which is really a deliverer. You mustn't think in terms of a magistrate or someone sitting at a bench.

A judge was a deliverer, essentially a savior and the judge would come and turn the people bet away from sin back to God and liberate them from the military oppressors and it was always fascinating. I'm very dramatic and some of the most famous people. We have Gideon here, we have Deborah here, we have Samson in this book and it's always thrilling and exciting to see the salvation come, they're saved you see.

But then when you get to chapter 17 to chapter 21 there's these last five chapters and they're very, very hard to understand because they don't seem to be about anything. There's no judges in here, there's no salvation that comes, God hardly shows up in some ways. And what's so intriguing is that there's two incidents.

In chapter 17 and 18 we have one and you've read half of it and in chapter 19 to 21 you have the other and the first one we've already read and what do we see here? Well first of all we see three, if you're going to give this story a title and it couldn't be a very interesting title because it's not a very interesting story, it's a bunch of trivial people doing kind of dumb, weird things. I could call it Micah, Mom and the Levite.

And what you have is you have these three people, first all you have Micah, cheating his mother. And then giving her the money back when she hears him, idling a curse against the robber whoever it is and he says, well you know I'm, I did it, I robbed and I was kind of scared when he's, you know he's not very good or very bad, I mean how good can you be to rob your own mother but then how bad could you be to get, you know give it back, you know kind of, gee I'm scared, you cursed, I wonder. And then so you see Micah, cheating his mother, then you see his mother cheating God because if you notice when she's really excited she says I will give it all back to the Lord.

I'm so happy about this, I'm so happy my son came back and did all, he says I solemnly constrict my silver, all I give it back but when she actually came to it she only used 200 checkers and she makes two images, two idols out of silver and puts them in in a sense her son's chapel where he worshiped the Lord. In complete contradiction to everything God says anywhere, right in the tank of maim, it's all through the law of Moses where he says you mustn't make images, you mustn't make idols. So first we have Micah cheating mom, then we have mom cheating God and then along comes the Levite.

And on what's his point? Well Micah and his mother decided they were going to have their own shrine. See in those days there was a tabernacle, a sanctuary, a place where God said worship me here and it was at Shiloh.

And in that tabernacle there was an effort that was the breastplate of a priest, that the priest wore and had stones on there through which God spoke to people. There was an effort and there was a priest and the priest had to be Levites, they had to be on the tribe of Levi. And there was a sanctuary where people could come and pray and worship.

But Micah and mom, they wanted to have their own sanctuary, they wanted to have their own place of worship. And so they made one of their sons, mom's grandson, Micah's son, a priest until along comes the Levite and Micah says, wow, I can have a genuine Levite here, just like in the law of Moses. So he says how much would you know be willing to work for this amount and Levites says, sure, fine.

And so now he says, boy, now I've really got a Levite, I've got an effort, I've got everything I want. Except in chapter 18, and this is how the story ends, a group of men come along, Danites, they're trying to find a new place to live. And they say to the Levite, you come with me, come with us, we'll pay you more.

And bring those images along, which, of course, were worth quite a bit of money. And so Micah comes running out saying, you stole my Levite, you stole my images, what are you doing in the Danites? I'd say, go home or I might hurt you.

And so he did. And that's how the story ends. And then in chapter 19 to 21, suddenly, at the very end of the book of Judges, we're completely unprepared.

After all these boring people doing all these trivial things, we're completely unprepared for what happens. There's a gang rape of a woman that leads to not just civil war between the tribes of Israel, but genocidal destruction of whole towns and villages down to the infants. And what's so strange about this, again, no judges, no salvation, no nothing, now what's going on here.

Now, on the one hand, this is terrible storytelling. Now when I say terrible storytelling, I don't mean I think this was just made up, but you see this incident was chosen out of this whole period of history. Why?

Why was it chosen? When I say it's a bad story, first of all, in a good story, you have to somebody, some character, who you get engaged with, that you care about, you have to have some character that you're concerned about, otherwise it's just a terrible narrative. And nobody here you care about, see, they're all, none of them are very good or very bad.

They're very shallow. They're very uninteresting. They're boring, they're very unprincipled.

They don't stand for anything. And not only that, there should be some kind of crisis, right, that's resolved. But the crisis that there is only crises that come about because they're so shallow and uninteresting and boring and unprincipled, why is this here?

And why would this be in front of this horrible story that comes right after? Well, it began to dawn on me, and it's dawned on other people. I'm not the only one who knows this or understands this, please.

There's no judges here, isn't this interesting? Every other part of the book is about God's salvation, and what the author is showing us, and therefore what God's showing us, is what we look like without a salvation, what we look like without Him, what we are in our natural state. In other words, this is showing us the nature of sin.

And this right away actually shows us some things that are very, very surprising to us. If you live in this society, you've got some, how do I say stereotypes about what you think the Bible teaches about sin and about evil. And this goes right against it.

Look, real briefly, because we're going to the Lord's table today, and we're going to have a series. Look, real briefly, let me show you. This tells us what sin does to us, what sin does to God, and how we can be cured of it.

What sin does to us, what sin does to God, and how we can be cured of it.

从前有一个名叫米迦的人住在以法莲山地，他对母亲说：“你知道那些一千一百舍客勒银子吗？就是有人从你那里偷走，并且你还咒诅了那个人？

”“我有那银子。”他母亲回答，“主必赐福与我的儿子。” 然后她把银子还给了米迦。米迦的母亲说：“我要将这银子归给耶和华，为我儿子铸造一个雕刻的偶像和铸成的偶像。

我把它还给你，耶和华见证吧。”于是米迦把银子还给他母亲，她拿了一千舍客勒银子交给匠人，他用这些银子做了雕像和神像，放在米迦的家中。米迦有一个圣所，并且制作了一些偶像，立他的一个儿子为祭司。那时以色列没有王，各人都按着自己的心意而行。

有一个年轻的利未人从伯利恒犹大支派中出来，在犹大家族中住了一段时间后，他离开那城寻找其他地方居住。当他经过以法莲山地米迦的家时，米迦问他：“你从哪里来？” 哦，我是伯利恒和犹大的利未人，他问我说。他说：“我要找一个住的地方。

”米迦对他说：“你同我住在一块儿吧！作我的父与祭司，我就每年给你十舍客勒银子、衣服和食物。”于是那利未人就同意同米迦住在一块儿了；那青年人在他家里就像自己的儿子一样。米迦便安置了那个利未人为他的祭司，在他家里住了下来。

米迦说：“现在我知道耶和华待我好，因为这利未人成了我的祭司。”现在让我告诉你们这里发生了什么事。人们常常忽略这一段或觉得它很困惑的原因是这样的：到目前为止，《士师记》中的所有内容都非常有趣。《士师记》记载的是以色列人在摩西和约书亚带领下从埃及进入迦南地之后的历史，前16章中有一系列引人入胜的故事，因为人们一次又一次地陷入罪恶之中，而当他们犯罪时，很快就会被外邦人奴役。

然后上帝会一次次地差派士师来拯救他们。你不要以为士师就是法官或坐在法庭上的那个人。士师实际上是一个救赎者，一个拯救者，他会带领人们远离罪恶回到上帝面前，并从军事压迫中解救他们。这总是非常迷人。

我非常戏剧化地描述了一些最著名的人物：我们有基甸在这里，我们有得示在这里，我们也有士师记中的参孙，看到这些拯救总是令人激动和兴奋。但是当你读到第17章到第21章时，你会发现最后五章的内容非常难以理解，因为它们似乎什么都没有。这里没有士师，也没有任何拯救发生，上帝几乎不出现。最引人注目的是，这里有两件事情。

在第17章和第18章中，我们读到了一半；而在第19章到第21章，另一半内容也在等待着你们。我们已经读过了前一部分，那么在这里我们看到了什么呢？首先，如果要给这个故事起个标题，那标题肯定不会太吸引人，因为这并不是一个有趣的故事，而是一些琐碎的人做了一些愚蠢、奇怪的事情。我可以用“米迦、妈妈和利未人”来命名它。

在这一系列人物中，我们先看到的是米迦欺骗了他的母亲。当他的母亲得知这件事后，他咒骂了那个强盗（无论他是谁），说：“我知道是我干的，我抢了我的母亲，当时我还挺害怕。” 他既不算是个好人也不算是个坏人——你很难想象一个会抢自己母亲的人能有多好，但又不得不承认，为了把钱还给母亲，他确实有点胆小。接着他说：“妈妈，你咒骂了我，我是不是应该有点儿害怕呢？

”于是我们看到米迦欺骗了他的母亲，然后他的母亲又欺骗了上帝——当她激动地说到儿子回来了，并且说要把所有的钱都献给耶和华时，她说：“我太高兴了，我的儿子回来了，他把所有的东西都还给了我。” 他说：“我郑重起誓，我把银子全还给了母亲。”但当她真正行动起来时，她只用了200舍客勒，并用这些银子做了两个偶像，放在她儿子的“神殿”里，供他崇拜耶和华。这完全违背了上帝在摩西五经中所说的任何地方都不能做偶像、不能立偶像的规定。

接着我们看到米迦欺骗了他的母亲，然后他的母亲又欺骗了上帝，之后利未人出现了。那么，作者想要表达什么观点呢？显然，米迦和他的母亲决定要建立自己的神殿。要知道，在那个时代，有一个圣所，一个地方是上帝说的：“在那里敬拜我。

” 那个地方就是示罗。在那会幕中，有一个祭司的胸牌，是神与人沟通的媒介。祭司需要佩戴它，并且上面有宝石，透过这些宝石，神向人们说话。祭司必须来自利未支派，他们属于利未人。

那里还有一个圣所，人们可以去祈祷和敬拜。但是米迦和他的母亲想要有自己的圣所，有自己的崇拜场所。于是他们让米迦的儿子，母亲的孙子，成为祭司。直到后来来了一个利未人，米迦说：“现在我可以有一个真正的利未人了，就像摩西的律法中所说的。

” 于是他问：“你愿意以这样的工资工作吗？” 利未人回答：“当然可以。” 就这样，米迦心想：现在我终于有了一个真正的利未人，有了祭司，拥有一切我想要的东西。然而，在第十八章，故事在这里结束，一群男人——但支派的人——来找他。

他们说：“你跟我来吧，我们会给你更多的报酬。” 并且还带着那些价值不菲的偶像。米迦跑出来喊道：“你们偷了我的祭司，偷了我的偶像，你们在干什么？” 我会说：“回家去，否则我可能会伤害你们。

” 于是他们离开了。这就是故事的结局。然后，在第十九章到第二十一章中，书末部分完全出乎意料。经历了这么多乏味的人做着琐碎的事，我们突然面对的是一个女人被轮奸的故事，这导致了以色列各部落之间的内战，并且整个城镇和村庄都被彻底摧毁，连婴儿也不放过。

如此令人震惊的情节，却没有任何法官、救赎或任何东西来解释这一切。从一方面来说，这是糟糕的叙事技巧。当我提到糟糕的叙事时，并不是说我认为这个故事是虚构的，而是说这个事件被选中出现在这段历史时期的原因是什么？为什么选这段呢？

当我说这是一段糟糕的故事时，首先，在一个好故事里，你必须有一个角色，一个你能够产生共鸣的人物，一个你关心的角色。否则，它就是一个糟糕的叙事。而这里没有一个人是你会关心的，他们都很平庸，既不特别好也不特别坏。他们很浅薄，毫无趣味性，无聊透顶，毫无原则可言。

他们什么都没有坚持。不仅如此，故事中还应该有一些危机，对吧？这些危机最终能够得到解决。但这里的危机只是因为他们太浅薄、无趣、无聊和没有原则才产生的，为什么这段话会在这里出现？

而且为什么会出现在这样一个糟糕的故事之后呢？渐渐地，我开始意识到这一点，并且其他人也有同样的看法。我不是唯一一个知道或理解这一点的人，请注意。这里没有法官，不是吗？

这很有趣。整本书的其他部分都在讲述上帝的救赎，而作者向我们展示的东西，也就是上帝向我们展示的东西，就是我们在没有救赎、没有祂的情况下是什么样子，也就是我们的自然状态。换句话说，这段话揭示了罪的本质。它立刻就告诉我们一些非常令人惊讶的事情。

如果你生活在这样的社会里，你对圣经关于罪和邪恶的教导有一些固有的看法。而这段话恰恰与这些看法相反。请稍作简要回顾一下，因为我们今天要去领主的晚餐，并且将有一系列的内容。请稍作简要回顾，让我来展示给你看。

这段话告诉我们罪对我们、对上帝做了什么，以及我们如何能够治愈它。罪对我们做了什么，对上帝做了什么，以及我们如何能够治愈它。

## 平庸之恶 / The Banality of Evil

And every one of them is surprising. The first one, what sin does to us.

What do you think sin really does to you in its advanced stages? What does sin really do to the human heart? What does it do to the character?

Most of us believe that most of us are kind of regular people. Of course, we sin, of course, to air is sin and to air is human and so on. But when we think of people who are really diabolical, really, really advanced in their evil, we think of evil geniuses.

We think of the people in all of the action films as terrible, those charming, those witty, but those diabolical, those cruel. That's not at all what the Bible says. When Hana Arant went to the trial of Adolf Heichmann, the Nazi butcher, she was shocked by what she found.

And she wrote an essay that really got a lot of flak. She wrote an essay on what she called the banality of evil. Now banal is a word that basically means common.

It means run of the mill. And she looked at this guy and she says, anybody could have done this must be a monster, but when she saw him, she realizes this isn't a monster. First of all, she found he was a boring little man.

He spoke in clichés, no insights, really very little sense of humor. And he had the absolute run of the mill, like all the rest of us, desire to be important, desire to be liked, ability to kind of, you know, not think about things that are unpleasant. And she wrote and she said, he wasn't a monster, he was just like all the rest of us.

He was boring and superficial, and uninteresting, and shallow. And people got very upset with her. And they said, you can't say that, anybody can do this, this man, anybody can do this cannot be like us.

And Hannah aren't got it partly right, but partly wrong, at least according to the Bible. Because she said, because he was so banal and superficial, it led him to do evil. But the Bible says it's evil that leads you to be banal.

The most advanced, the most prominent, the most characteristic, effective sin on the human heart is not to make us bad but boring. There's nobody that said it better than C. S.

Lewis, of course, and actually I've got a number of his quotes that helped me with this sermon. He says, I am really upset with the most pernicious of all the literary images of evil. It's Gert is Mephistopheles in Faust.

The humorous, civilized Mephistopheles strengthens the illusion that evil is liberating. But the real mark of hell is a sleepless, unsmiling concentration upon the self. You must understand hell as a place where everyone is perpetually concerned about his or her own dignity and advancement, where everybody always has a grievance, and where everybody lives in the deadly seriousness of envy and self-importance.

Here's another section, in preface to Paradise Lost Lewis as this, to admire Satanist to give one's vote for a world of lies, propaganda, and incessant autobiography. At the choice as possible, hardly a day passes without some slight movement toward it in every one of us. Sin in each of us is something that once just to be petted and admired, to take advantage of other lives.

It especially wants to be left to itself. It wants to keep well away from anything better or stronger higher than it. Anything that would make it feel small, but unimpeded, sin will exploit the whole universe if it could.

Now, here's what Lewis is saying. Here's what Hannah Arnt saw at least partially. Here's what we're being told.

Why in the world would this be considered, a case study of human beings without God? Why not something more awful? Why not something more cruel?

Why not something more like the last part of the book? What is this about? And the answer is what Lewis says.

The most interesting, advanced sin makes you boring because all you're ever worried about is how you're doing, how you look, how things are affecting you. There's always agreements incessant autobiography. You can never get out of yourself.

You're always feeling sorry for yourself. And you know what's so weird about this. You say, ah, that's not like Jack Nicholson is the Joker in Batman.

I mean, there's evil. You know, no. Sin makes you mediocre.

The most advanced sin makes there's nothing more boring than somebody's always worried about how you look. Sin makes you these very uninteresting, unprincipled, shallow, boring people. It's pretty interesting.

There's an article called the Culture Zone Column in the New York Times Magazine today about the tremendous popularity of one, you know, one-person shows. Have you seen that? Or they just get up and they stand up there and they talk about their lives and they talk about their stories and they talk about everything, one-person shows.

And virtually everybody knows it's sort of an open secret even though it keeps going that the vast majority of people are just boring. The vast majority of people, those one-person shows, tell you way too much. This is what the line says in the article, way too much about people that you have no desire to know.

Why are people so uninteresting when they just simply talk? They're not part of a story when they just say, here's how I feel. Here's what's on my mind.

It's sleepless, unsmiling concentration on the self. That's the essence of sin. And the first thing we see here is that what sin really does is not make you bad before it makes you boring.

That's the primary thing, incessant autobiography.

每一个点都非常令人惊讶。第一个点，罪对我们做了什么。

你觉得在罪的晚期阶段，罪真正对你做了什么？罪对人类的心灵做了什么？它又怎样影响了你的品格呢？大多数人都认为自己是普通的人。

当然，我们都会犯错，毕竟人非圣贤，孰能无过。但当我们想到那些极其邪恶、真正达到恶的顶峰的人时，我们会想到邪恶天才。我们会想到电影中的反派角色，他们迷人而机智，但又极其邪恶。圣经却说并非如此。

汉娜·阿兰特在旁听纳粹刽子手阿道夫·希姆莱的审判时，被她所看到的一切震惊了。她在一篇文章中提出了“平庸之恶”的概念，这篇文章引起了很大的争议。这个词语的意思基本上是普通的、常见的。她观察这个人后说：“任何人都能做这样的事，他应该是个怪物。

”但她见到他后意识到，这并不是一个怪物。首先，她发现他是一个无聊的小人物，说话老套，缺乏洞察力，几乎没有幽默感。他对重要性有绝对的渴望，希望被喜欢，并且能够不去思考不愉快的事情。她在文章中写道：“他不是怪物，他和其他人一样。

”他很无趣、肤浅、乏味和空洞。人们对此非常不满，说：“你不能这么说，任何人都能做这样的事，这个人不可能像我们一样。”汉娜·阿兰特说得对又不对，至少根据圣经来说是这样。因为她认为希姆莱之所以如此平庸和肤浅，才导致他做了邪恶的事。

但圣经却说，是邪恶让你变得平庸。人类心中最先进、最突出、最具特征的有效罪恶，并不是让我们变坏，而是让人变得无趣。C.S.刘易斯说得最好了，当然我这里也有一些他的名言帮助我准备这次讲道。他说：“我真正不满的是文学作品中最为有害的形象之一，那就是《浮士德》中的梅菲斯特。

” 讽刺而文明的靡非斯特强化了邪恶是解放的幻象。但地狱的真实标志是一个人永无止息、面无笑容地专注于自我。你必须理解，地狱是一个每个人都在不断关注自己尊严和进步的地方，在那里每个人都怀有怨言，每个人都生活在嫉妒和自视甚高的死板严肃中。在《失乐园》中，路易斯以讽刺的态度赞赏撒旦主义者，并让人投票支持一个充满谎言、宣传和无休止的自我叙述的世界。

几乎每一天，我们都不可避免地向那个方向迈出一小步。在我们每个人心中，罪恶是一种曾经被宠爱和赞美、利用他人生活的存在。它特别希望独处。它想远离任何比它更好、更强或更高的东西。

任何让它感到渺小但不受阻碍的事物，罪恶都会利用整个宇宙来实现。现在，让我们看看路易斯说了什么。至少部分地，汉娜·阿恩特也看到了这一点。这就是我们被告知的真相。

为什么这会被认为是人类脱离上帝后的研究案例？为什么不更糟糕一些？为什么不更残忍一些？为什么不更像书的最后一部分呢？

这是关于什么呢？答案就是路易斯所说的。最高级的罪恶使你变得无聊，因为你总是只关心自己的表现、外貌以及外界如何影响你。总有无休止的自我叙述。

你永远无法摆脱自己。你总是自怜自艾。而最奇怪的是，你会说，哦，这不像杰克·尼科尔森在《蝙蝠侠》中扮演的小丑。毕竟，有邪恶存在。

不，罪恶使你变得平庸。最高级的罪恶让你觉得，没有什么比总是担心自己外貌更无聊的事情了。罪恶使你成为那些非常无趣、没有原则、肤浅而无聊的人。这真是很有趣。

在《纽约时报杂志》今天的文化区专栏中，有一篇文章谈到了独角戏的惊人流行。你看过吗？这些人只是站上去讲自己的故事，讲自己的生活，讲一切。几乎每个人都明白一个公开的秘密：尽管这种现象持续存在，但大多数人的独角戏其实非常无聊。

这些独角戏告诉了我们太多关于别人的故事，而这些是你根本不想知道的。人们为什么在简单交谈时会变得如此无趣？他们不参与故事，只是说：“这是我的感受。”“这是我脑子里的想法。

” 这是一种对自我的无眠、无笑的专注。这就是罪的本质。在这里，我们首先看到的是：罪不会让你变坏，它会让你变得无聊。这是一切罪的第一大特征——不断的自我叙述。

但更令人惊讶的是第二点，即罪如何影响你对待上帝的态度。当罪毁掉你时，问题在于你的自我认知早已基于对上帝的认知。你对自己的理解总是建立在对上帝的理解之上。你对自己情感的表达也总是基于对你所感知到的上帝的情感。

## 将上帝缩小为我们的模样 / Whittling God Down to Our Size

But that's the first surprising thing. But the second surprising thing is, like, in a way more seminal.

It's in the Bible when sin ruins you. It's because already your attitude toward yourself is always based on your attitude toward God. Your understanding of yourself is always based on your understanding of God.

Your emotions toward yourself are always based on your emotions toward God. Because what we have here is just as surprising. It tells us what sin leads us to do toward God.

What does sin lead us to do? How does sin lead us to regard God? Now, again, most people would think that advance sin would make you an atheist.

That's advanced. We have a lot of those advanced sinners right around New York City, actually a pretty surprising number. High percentage that don't want any other city in the country.

People say, I don't believe in God. And maybe you're one of those. I don't know.

You know, somebody brought you here out of curiosity. Maybe you're one of those. Well, I got good news for you.

Atheism is not the essence of sin at all. Here's what we're told. Says, I dedicate to the Lord these two images.

Boy, that's terrible. Doesn't she know what the 10 commandments says, the first commandment? They'll shout, not worship any other gods.

Doesn't the first commandment say, I should have no other gods before me? Why is she making those idols? Doesn't she know?

Why would she worship other gods right there in front of God, right in his shrine, you see? And the answer is, she's not worshiping other gods. Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache.

We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way? And what can be done about it?

In his brand new book that's releasing this month, what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer. Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer, Dr.

Keller shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes or choices, or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world will help you see how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us. This newly released book, What Is Wrong with the World, is our thanks for your gift this month to help gospel in life share the good news of Jesus.

And request your copy today at gospelonlife.com slash give, that's gospelonlife.com slash give. Now here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching.

Listen, there's plenty of gods named in the book of Judges. The Canaanites had the bales and the asterisks and the Philistines had dagon and the Syrians had Rimon and the Mowbites had Kimosh, but she doesn't say I'm going to make an Isle of Kimosh, she didn't make a bale, she didn't make an asterisks, she didn't make a Kimosh, she had a dagon of Rimon. What did she make?

Who are these images of? Well, they're the ones in whose name they're dedicated. These are images of God, these are images of the Lord God, these are images of Yahweh the God of Israel.

What she has done is not she hasn't, she hasn't worshipped another God and she's not worshiping no God, she's worshipping a reduced God. She has whittled God down, she has made him, she has put a handle on him. This is a God you can put in your purse.

This is a God you can take places with you. This is a God who's manageable, this is a God who's tame and this is the heart of sin. A little God, a manageable tamed God will make you a little manageable, controllable person.

Is it? Han Ahren said the scary thing was that banal person was capable of unbelievable terror and evil under certain circumstances. And the point at the end of the book of Judges is banal people caused by sin, sleepless un, sleepless concentration on the self, unsmiling, humorless, therefore boring.

Incessant autobiography makes you feel so sorry for yourself that you are capable of terrible things eventually. All of our problems come in essence from whittling God down, Psalm 50 verse 21 talks about it, when God looks at the people and he doesn't say you've rejected me, he doesn't even say you're worshiping other gods, what does he say? He says you thought this is songs 50 verse 21, you thought I was like yourself.

And this is the essence of sin. We are sure God has got to be like us. We're going to whittle them down to our size, let me give you some examples of how we do it.

The only few, Kathy said please keep it at about 30 because we were sitting and talking about him. I began to realize, well this is the essence, look number one, first of all we think God's like us and we think he can be bought. Some of you have started coming to church, started reading your Bible, started cleaning up your life because you say I need strength, I need inspiration, stop it.

Well, wait a minute, shouldn't I read my Bible, shouldn't I pray? Should I live a good life, shouldn't I come to church, isn't that what God wants? Well, he said all depends on why you're doing it because here's what I'm afraid, almost always the way we, when we move toward God, our hearts are filled with this and therefore we always in the beginning start like this.

We think God can be bought, we think God can be impressed. And the reason we start cleaning our life up is what? So we can say, and here's the essence of sin, now God has to be good to me because I'm doing everything right.

See, Michael was so happy that he knew he was out of compliance with his own son as a priest. He realized what the word of God said, but oh, wait a minute, I can get a leave, I'll leave it. Now surely God will be good to me, he's obeying, but why is he obeying?

To get control of God, to buy him, highly religious people who are absolutely sure that God has to be good to you, God has to answer your prayers, God has to bless you, God has to give you a good life, God has to give you the spouse of your dreams, why? Because I'm doing everything right. Now the Lord has to be good to me, what have you done?

You put a handle on God, you're trying to control God, you whittled him down, you think he's like you, they can be bought, they can be impressed, he can't be. And by the way, there's nothing they'll make you more boring than making you a smug self-righteous religious person, nothing, they're the worst kind. Little God creates little people.

Secondly, we think God's like us because, you know, it can be bought, secondly, you think God's like you because you don't think he's any wiser than you are. Do you know why we're so scared so often, why we're so angry because things aren't going right? Do you know why so many of you have walked away saying, I cannot believe in a God who would let this happen and this happen and this happen.

What are you saying? What are you saying? What you're saying is because I can't think of a good reason for this to have happened, there can't be one.

Now, when you say, I can't believe in a God who would let this happen, you simply have pulled him down, you said, he couldn't be wiser than me, well, not what? How acidized is that intellectually? You know, to say, if you believe there's a God big enough to have caused this, then you've got to believe there's a God who's big enough to have some reason for it bigger than you, that you wouldn't know.

You can't have it both ways. You can't be mad at God because you acknowledge He's more powerful than you, but then you will let Him be more wise than you. I mean, that's just, and yet we're so bitter in our soul and we're so cast down all the time.

Why? Because we just don't believe God. You believe I'm like you, He says.

You have whittled me down. You've made me into an image something controllable. You've revised me.

You've edited me. You've pulled me down. You know, Elizabeth Alleya, who often quote, when she, there was a book she wrote years ago about her husband and a number of other women's husbands were killed in the jungles of South America as part of their missionary work.

It's called Through the Gates of Splendor, and many years later, it was reissued in a kind of silver anniversary edition, and she wrote an epilogue to it, and this is what she said in it, and it just slammed me. She says, people asked me, what did you learn from all that? What did you learn from your husband, the love of your life being killed when you had a little baby girl and you'd only been married for two years?

What did you learn? And this is what she said. I have reflected on all that happened to me, and one thing, one thing is pointed out, quote, if he is God, he is worthy of my worship and my service, and I will find rest nowhere, but in his will, and that will is infinitely immeasurably, unspeakably beyond my largest notion of what he is up to.

The one thing I learned is if he's God, I will find no rest anywhere but in his will, and that's true of everybody in the face of this earth. They'll never be freedom in your heart unless you are willing to admit that his will is infinitely immeasurably, unspeakably beyond my largest notion of what he's up to. Let me give you a couple more.

We think he's like us in math, in other words, we think he can be bought. Secondly, we think he is like us in his wisdom, therefore, we can't think of something. If we get no worries up to them, he can't be up to anything good.

Thirdly, we think he's like us in our scale. Scale, I got this from Kathy late last night. She's been reading the series in the New York Times Science section on what we're learning about the galaxies.

Now listen, you know this, you know, stuff like this. The distance from the earth to the sun, 93 million miles, was reduced to the thickness of a piece of paper. Then the diameter of just this galaxy would be a stack of paper, 310 miles high.

And our galaxy is just one of gazillions and gazillions of galaxies just in our cluster. Our galaxy relates just to the cluster of galaxies. The way a single grain of sand would relate to all the beaches on the entire and all the sand and all the coasts of Florida, that's how many galaxies there are.

And that's just in our cluster. And even from the moon, you can't see us, we're going to expect from the moon. And yet the Bible says that if there is a God, think about this, he holds the world together.

He holds it all up with the word of his power. The entire universe is like a contact lens on his little finger. Now, do you say to somebody like that, please come into my life to be my assistant?

Do you say to somebody like that, don't call us, we'll call you? Do you say something like that? Well yeah, I might deal with you after I've had a little fun.

I've moved to New York City after all. Do you say, well, I'll be happy to believe in you if you give me a complete explanation for all of my questions. You've forgotten the scale.

You think I'm like, you are da, you know, the audacity of it, give you another one. You know racism is, racism is, it's taking cultural differences and I'm viewing them with moral significance. Let's just say, listen, white racism isn't the only kind of racism, but it's pretty prominent.

So let me pick on us white people, all right, for a second. Okay, what do white people do? They, especially what do northern European types do, you know, us with the background, you know, British or German and all that.

We see these ethnic groups and they're much more emotional. So when they're happy, they're more emotional and when they're sad, they're more emotional. What do you feel when you see that?

You say, this sort of lost it haven't they kind of, you know, they're different, but you deepen your heart, have assigned moral superiority to your difference and moral inferiority to their difference. And they're going to do the same thing. I know that, but here's the point.

What is white racism? It's saying, my God is white. My God is like me.

God is white. That's exactly what Psalm 50 verse 21, you thought I was like, you, everything comes from that. All of our doubts, all of our anger, you see, all of our self-righteousness.

I'll give you another one, you think God is like you in his attitude toward time. You know, when God sees time, he sees it all at once. If you were high up over the earth, he would look down at the Mississippi River and all parts of the Mississippi River would be equally visible, right?

If you're down on the Mississippi River, you only see your bend. Now, a lot of you are saying, oh, years ago, yes, I did this and yes, I did this and yes, I did these things, but you know, they were bad, but you know, I've gotten over it. Certainly God wouldn't hold that against me.

My friends, God's attitude toward God is the very, the thing you remember way in the past, he is seeing now. He's still happening right in his nostrils. This is the reason why God has got of justice.

This is the reason why God never gets over anything. This is the reason why there has to be atonement, there has to be punishment. And when you say, well, you know, why, I can't believe in a God who judges, you think he's like you.

You think that because of the terrible things you've done and at the time you felt dog on guilty and it hurt a lot of people, but now it's been a year, it's been two years, it's been ten years, it doesn't bother you anymore. We thought I was like you. All of our problems come from this.

Because God, our God has become little, we've made him little, we've made him manageable, we get rid of the things that we don't like. Oh, I can't believe in this anymore, I can't believe in that anymore. We've whittled him down as a result.

We've been whittled up, there's no greatness to us, there's no freedom. Do you realize if you really accepted the God that Elizabeth always talking about, a God who is infinite, his will is infinitely and measurably beyond anything you can ever, any notion of what he's up to? If you said, I accept that, I embrace that, you'd be free, totally free, nothing can bother you anymore.

If you said, I'm not trying to obey God so He'll be good to me, so He'll give me the things I want, so He'll give me the status, He'll give me the marriage, so He'll give me the things I want. Instead, if you said, but He said, not I'm going to use Him to get the things that give me meaning in life, but that He is my meaning in life. If you really made Him your meaning in life, if He was the ultimate instead of just a little means to an end, something you've learned how to handle in order to get what you want.

If He was your meaning in life, in other words, if He was big, you'd be big. If He was great in your eyes, you'd be a great heart. You would walk through life greatly, you wouldn't be scared and upset and circumstances beating you around all the time.

This is the reason why there's this one little place in the Narnia Chronicles, those fairy tales by C. S. Lewis.

It goes by so fast that you just don't even notice its significance, but it's so incredibly interesting. It's where little Lucy meets Aslan, who's Jesus. He's a lion, and she meets him in the second book, and she says, Aslan, at last, welcome child.

He says, Aslan said, Lucy, you're bigger. That's because you're older, little child. Not because you're bigger?

No. The bigger you get, the more you grow, the more you'll find me bigger. Now, what does He say?

It goes by so fast, you don't even stop and think about it, Pilates. Lewis is saying, the bigger your God is, the bigger you will be. The more you let God be God, the more you make Him not a means to an end but the end.

Not someone has to answer your questions. The more you put Him on His proper scale, the more of a great heart you will be. Well, how?

How is it possible? How in the world? And you know what?

The normal thing for Christian to do, and I'll tell you, over the years, I used to end my sermons here. I used to say, now what? I know.

I've got sermons like this from the past. I've been looking at them over the last couple of weeks. I would say study the attributes of God.

Think of His holiness. Think of His majesty. Think of His wisdom.

Don't whittle them down. Except everything the Bible says about it. What is this commandment where He says, do not make a graven image of me, He says.

And what He's saying is, don't imagine me to be what you want me to be but worship me as I am. So what does it mean? Except what He says.

But you know what? When I study, when I just study His holiness, when I just study His majesty, when I just study His wisdom, I don't feel, I'm not getting greater, I'm not getting bigger. It just starts to crush me and it'll crush you.

This thing that has on saying to Lucy, I don't sense that dynamic at all, it just makes me feel worse and worse and worse. It's like, oh my word, this is God but I'm going to have to just put up with it.

这里有一个更加惊人的发现：它告诉我们，罪是如何引导我们看待上帝的。那么，罪会让我们如何对待上帝？人们通常认为，更严重的罪行会让你成为一个无神论者。但这不是罪的本质。

事实上，正如文章所说：“我将这两幅图像献给主。” 你可能会想，无神论才是罪的本质。但事实并非如此。这里告诉我们的是：我将这两幅图像献给主。

这给了我们一个启示——罪引导我们如何对待上帝。男孩，这真是太糟糕了。她难道不知道十诫的第一条是什么吗？他们喊叫着，而不是去崇拜其他的神。

第一诫不是说“除了我以外，你不可有别的神”吗？她为什么要做这些偶像呢？她难道不知道？为什么她在上帝的圣殿前崇拜其他神明呢？

答案是，她并没有崇拜其他神明。我们无处不在地看到破碎、战争、残忍和痛苦。我们在周围的世界和自己的生活中都能感受到这种痛苦。这一切是怎么来的？

又该怎样解决呢？在本月新出版的一本书《世界出了什么问题》中，Tim Keller 提供了一个清晰而充满同情的答案。这本书源自他在 Redeemer 教会的一系列讲道。Keller 展示了罪恶的现实如何解释我们周围看到的一切痛苦，并且只有福音能带来持久的自由和治愈。

无论你是被这个世界的状态所困扰，还是在挣扎自己的错误或选择，或是寻找希望与喜悦，《世界出了什么问题》都将帮助你理解福音是如何回应这个世界的痛苦以及内心的伤痛。这本书是本月您礼物的感谢，它将帮助我们分享耶稣的好消息。现在就访问 gospelonlife.com/give 获取您的副本吧。现在请听 Dr. Keller 继续今天的教导。

听着，在《士师记》中提到了很多神的名字。迦南人有巴力和亚斯他录，非利士人有多干，西缅人有瑞门，摩押人有基抹，但她没有说我要建立一个基抹之岛，她也没有造巴力、亚斯他录或基抹的偶像，她只是造了一个多干和瑞门的偶像。她造的是什么呢？这些图像代表谁呢？

好吧，它们是被献给这些神明的名字。这些都是上帝的形象，都是耶和华以色列的上帝的形象。> 她所做的并不是没有做，不是另拜别神，也不是不敬拜任何神，而是将神缩小了。她把神削得只剩一点点，为他装了个把手。

这是一位你可以放在钱包里的神。这是一位你能够随身携带的神。这是一位可以掌控、驯服的神，而这正是罪的本质。一位渺小的神，一位可控制的驯服之神，会让你成为一个渺小且可控的人。

是这样吗？汉阿伦曾说过，最可怕的是平庸之人，在特定情境下能够制造出难以置信的恐怖和邪恶。而书卷末尾的主题就是：罪导致了平庸之人变得无眠、专注于自我、没有笑容、缺乏幽默感，因此显得无聊乏味。不断的自传式思考会让你对自己的生活感到极度同情，最终你发现自己竟然能做些可怕的事情。

我们所有的问题都源于将神缩小。诗篇50章21节提到这一点：当神看着人们时，并不说你们拒绝了我，也不说你们敬拜其他神明，他怎么说？他说：“你们以为我是像你们一样吗？”这就是罪的本质。

我们坚信神必须像我们一样。让我们来看一些例子，说明我们是如何这样做的。凯西曾说，请保持在大约30分钟内，因为我们当时正在讨论这位神。我逐渐意识到，这正是问题的核心：首先，我们认为神就像我们，并且认为他可以被买通。

你们中有些人开始来教会、读圣经、改善自己的生活，因为你说你需要力量和灵感。等等一下，难道我不应该读圣经、祷告吗？难道我不应该过好生活、不应该来教会吗？这不正是神所希望的吗？

但他说这一切都取决于你为什么这么做，因为我担心几乎总是当我们向神靠近时，我们的内心充满了这种想法，因此我们总是在开始时这样行动。我们以为神可以被买通，以为神可以被感动。所以我们开始整顿自己的生活，为什么？这就说出了罪的本质：现在我要表现得一切都很对，神就必须对我好。

看看迈克尔吧，他那么高兴，因为他知道自己违背了作为牧师的儿子的职责。他明白圣经上的话，但等等，我可以请个假，我请假去。现在神一定会对我好，因为我顺服了，但他为什么要去顺服呢？试图掌控神、买通神的人，那些坚信神必须对你好的人，认为神必须回应你的祷告，神必须祝福你，给你一个好生活，给你梦寐以求的伴侣，为什么？

因为我在一切上都做得很好。现在主必须对我好，你做了什么？你给神装上了把手，试图控制神，把神缩小了，你以为他像你一样可以被买通、被感动，不是这样的。顺便说一句，没有什么比让你成为一个自以为是的宗教徒更能让你变得无聊的了，他们是最糟糕的那种人。

小神创造了小人。其次，我们以为神像我们，因为你知道，神是可以被买通的；其次，我们认为神像我们是因为我们认为他没有你聪明。你们知道为什么我们常常害怕、生气，事情不按预期发展吗？你们知道为什么那么多人都说：“我不相信一个会让这种事情发生的神。

” 你在说什么？你在说什么？你说的是因为你找不到一个好的理由来解释这一切的发生，所以它不可能有原因。当你说到“我不相信一个会让这种事发生”的时候，你只是把神拉低了。

你说了，他不能比你聪明，那不是什么？这在智力上有多酸涩？你知道，如果你相信有一个足够大到能引起这一切的神，那么你也必须相信有一个足够大的神，他的理由比你大得多，而这些是你无法理解的。你不能两头都要。

你承认上帝比你更有力量，却还生他的气；同时又认为他应该比你更智慧，却不让他来指引你。这简直是自相矛盾，但我们的心里总是充满怨恨和沮丧。为什么呢？因为我们根本不相信上帝。

祂说：“你以为我跟你一样吗？” 你已经把祂缩小了，把祂塑造成一个可以控制的形象。你已经修改了祂。你已经编辑了祂。

你已经拉低了祂。伊丽莎白·阿莱亚曾经说过一段话，她说：“人们问我从中学到了什么？我的丈夫——我生命中的挚爱，在我生下女儿仅两年后就被杀害在南美洲丛林中，进行传教工作时牺牲了。你们问我要从中学习到什么？

” 她回答说：“我反思了一切发生的事情，得出一个结论：如果祂是上帝，祂值得我去敬拜和服侍；而我在祂的旨意之外，将找不到安宁。祂的旨意远远超出了我所能想象的一切。” 这个真理适用于每一个人。除非你愿意承认祂的旨意是无法衡量、无法形容、远超出你对祂计划的最大想象，否则你的心中永远不会有自由。

我们还觉得上帝在数学上像我们一样，换句话说，我们认为祂可以被买通；其次，我们认为祂和我们在智慧上是一样的，因此如果我们想不出什么好主意，就认为祂也做不成好事。第三，我们认为他和我们一样有同样的规模。尺度，我从凯西昨晚晚些时候得到的灵感。她一直在读《纽约时报》科学版上关于我们在星系方面学到的新知识。

现在听我说，你们知道这些事情。比如，地球到太阳的距离是9300万英里，如果把它缩小到纸张的厚度。那么，我们这个星系的直径就是一叠这样的纸，高达310英里。而我们的星系只是数十亿甚至更多星系中的一员，它们都位于同一个星系团内。

我们的星系相对于整个星系团来说，就像一粒沙子与佛罗里达州所有海滩上的沙子相比一样。星系的数量是如此之多。这只是在我们这个星系团里的数量。甚至连从月球上看，你都无法看到地球。

然而圣经却说，如果上帝存在的话，请想一下，他用他的话语力量支撑着整个世界。整个宇宙在他的一根手指上就像隐形眼镜一般轻盈。那么，你会对这样的人说，请来我的生活中做我的助手吗？你会对这样的人说，不要打电话给我们，我们会给你打电话吗？

你真的会这样说吗？好吧，我可能会在玩了一把之后再考虑一下。毕竟我已经搬到纽约市了。你会说，如果你们能给我一个完整的解释来回答我所有的疑问，我会很高兴相信你们的。

你忘记了尺度的问题。你以为自己和他一样渺小，这种胆量真是令人惊讶。让我再举个例子。你知道种族主义是什么吗？

种族主义就是把文化差异赋予道德意义。让我们这么说吧，白人至上主义并不是唯一一种种族主义，但它确实很突出。所以现在我来批评一下我们这些白人。好吧，白人都在做什么呢？

尤其是那些北欧血统的人，比如有英国或德国背景的我们。我们会发现这些族群更加情绪化。当他们开心时更开心，悲伤时也更悲伤。当你看到这种情况时，你有什么感觉？

> 你说，这失落了没有呢？他们好像不一样了，但你的心若更深一层，就会赋予自己的不同以道德优越感，而将他们的不同视为道德劣等。他们会做同样的事。我知道这一点，但重点在于： 什么是白人种族主义？

那就是说：我的神是白色的。我的神就像我一样。神是白色的。这正是诗篇50章21节所说的：“你若认为我是像你们的。

”一切疑虑、愤怒和自以为义都源于此。再给你举一个例子，你以为神对你时间的态度与你的态度是一样的吗？你知道，当神看待时间时，他看到的是整个过去。如果你站在高处俯瞰密西西比河，整条河流都会一目了然，对吧？

而你若站在河边，只能看到自己的那一段。现在有很多人说：“是的，多年前我做过这些事，但我知道那是错的，我已经克服了。”当然，你觉得神不会记在心上。我的朋友们，神看待时间的态度正是你们记忆中的过去，他现在仍然在看。

这正是神有公义的原因。这也是为什么神从不忘记任何事情的原因。这也解释了为何需要赎罪和惩罚。当你认为：“我不相信一个会审判的神”，你认为他是像你的。

你以为因为自己做了可怕的事，在当时感到内疚并伤害了许多人，但现在已经过去一年、两年甚至十年，这些事不再困扰你。我们以为神是像我们的。所有的问题都源于此。因为我们把神变得渺小了，我们让他变得可以掌控，摒弃那些我们不喜欢的东西。

“我不再相信这个了”，“我不再相信那个了”。结果，我们将他缩小了。我们被削减得所剩无几，没有伟大可言，也没有自由。你是否意识到，如果你真的接受了伊丽莎白一直谈论的那个无限的神，他的旨意远远超乎你能想象或理解的一切？

如果你说：“我接受这一点，我拥抱这一点”，你就会获得**真正的自由，彻底的自由，任何事情都无法再困扰你。如果你说：“我不是**为了顺服神好让他对我好，给我想要的东西，给我地位，给我婚姻，给我想要的一切。”相反，如果你说：“但祂说过，不是我要用祂来得到生命中的意义，而是祂是我的生命的意义。” 如果你真的让祂成为你的生命意义，如果祂是终极目标而不是一个达到目的的手段，那么你会变得伟大。

换句话说，如果祂在你心中显得伟大，你也就会变得伟大。如果你觉得祂很了不起，你的心灵也会变得宽广。你会以一种伟大的姿态生活，不再害怕和焦虑，不再被环境所左右。这就是为什么在《纳尼亚传奇》这部奇幻小说中有一个小细节如此重要，却常常被人忽略。

这个情节转瞬即逝，你甚至没有注意到它的意义，但它非常有趣。这是小露西遇见耶稣的形象——狮子阿斯兰的地方，在第二本书里，她对他说：“阿斯兰，终于见到你了，孩子。” 他回答说：“露西，你变大了。” 她问：“是因为我年纪大了吗？

不是因为变得更大吗？” 随着你成长得更多，你会发现祂也更大。现在，祂说了什么？这个情节转瞬即逝，你甚至来不及思考，莱斯（Pilates）说：C.S.刘易斯的意思是，你的神越大，你就越伟大。

你让神成为祂应有的地位，而不是一个达到目的的手段时，你的心灵就会变得宽广。那么，这是如何可能的？这怎么可能呢？你知道吗？

基督徒通常会做的事情，而且我可以告诉你们，在过去的年头里，我常常会在布道结束时这样说：“现在怎么办？我知道了。” 我有一些以前的讲道稿，最近几周一直在看。我会说，要研究神的属性。

想想祂的圣洁。想想祂的伟大。想想祂的智慧。不要削减这些属性。

接受圣经中关于它们的一切教导。比如，祂曾说过，“你们不可为自己雕刻偶像。”这是什么意思？祂的意思是，不要想象我是你想要的样子，而是要敬拜我真实的模样。

那么这又意味着什么呢？只接受祂所说的。但是你知道吗？当我研究祂的圣洁，研究祂的伟大，研究祂的智慧时，并没有觉得自己的内心变得更大或更高尚。

这些只会让我感到越来越渺小，也会让你感到如此。当我说给露西听的时候，我完全感觉不到那种动态，反而感到越来越糟糕。就像啊，天哪，这是神，但我也只能接受它了。

## 真正的形象：耶稣基督 / The True Image: Jesus Christ

But the answer is this, in verse 6, it says, the reason for all this was there was no king.

Do you see that? It says, the reason all this idiotic, idiocy, the reason all this smallness in those days Israel had no king. Now what is the author saying?

He says, there's no savior. We need something better than these judges. We need a king.

But when you get to the king, even the best king, David, we see that he needed a savior. And what we're being pointed to is simply this. Why is it that God said no image?

Why is it that Israel was the only religion on the face of the earth at that time? It's the first religion, almost invented it. That if you went into this temple, you went into the holy of Holies, into the inner sanctum, and you even went to the ark of the covenant, which is the throne of God.

There was the cherubim, the angels, facing inward, and right where you expect to see an image, something palpable, something you could grab hold on, something accessible, right? We're physical beings, we have, we have, we taste touch here, see smell, we have senses and we want to see something, we want to feel something. And right there, there's nothing.

God says, don't you, they're putting an image there. My throne is empty. Can you say how my word is that it?

We have to put up with an abstract invisible God, a God we can't touch, God we can't see here, or smell, and God says, no, no, no, no, don't you dare put an image there, but not because there never will be one. In Colossians chapter 1, verse 15, we read something amazing, he is the image, Jesus Christ, is the image of the invisible God, for by him all created, all things were created, whether the thrones or powers or rulers or authorities. Now here's what God is saying, God is saying, I understand why you want an image.

I understand why you want something you can grab hold on, and I will give you something. I will supply the image, don't you supply the image because any image you try to make me, make of me, to make me something you can relate to will only make me tinier and smaller and it will make you smaller. But I will give you the true image, a living image, the Lord Jesus Christ, and he will so reveal my glory that on the one hand he will be someone you finally can relate to a human being a person, someone who loves and who weeps and who embraces, finally someone who is successful but somebody who actually makes me in your mind greater than you could imagine.

Not smaller but greater, why? Because this great God, you know, before whom we are nothing but specks, we are nothing but specks of dust, we are nothing but paramecium, we are nothing but amoebas. No other image could possibly have told us what this image does and that is he came to die for us, he died for the paramecium, he died for the amoebas.

When you have a God that is so big that he could become small, you got a bigger God than you could have imagined. No other religion has such a God, no other religion admits that God is so big he could have become small. Only when you have a God like that, only when you admit that Jesus Christ is the image of God that he died for me, that is what finally shows me a greatness beyond anything I would know otherwise but it is not a greatness that crushes me.

Now I want to live for him. Now I don't say, now God has got to be good to me because I am obeying all the rules because Jesus is my goodness. He is the thing.

I would want more than that, he is my meaning in life now. You see God can't be bought but we can. The bigger he gets, the bigger we will get.

Let's pray. Father, we know that one of the reasons for the Lord's supper is it is something physical. It is something we can put in our hands and it reminds us that you have put Jesus Christ on the earth to be our image, image of you, our way of understanding your greatness.

It is only as we receive him, as we remember what he has done, that you finally take in our minds your proper proportions and when that happens we will be so free. We pray, Lord, that you will make yourself real to us and your proper proportions as we take the Lord's supper as we take the bread and the cup. Be yourself in our eyes, be yourself in our hearts, be yourself so we can finally be ourselves.

What you have made us to be in Jesus' name we pray, amen. Thanks for listening to Tim Keller on the Gospel Unlife Podcast.

但是答案在第六节中，那里说："因为没有王，所以这一切都发生了。

” 你看出来了吗？这里说的是，由于以色列当时没有国王，才导致了一切的愚昧和渺小。那么作者在这里想说什么呢？他说，没有救主。

**我们需要比这些法官更好的东西。****我们需要一个国王。**但是当你提到国王时，即使是最好的国王大卫也需要救主。我们被引导认识到的是这样一点：为什么神说不能有偶像？

为什么以色列在那个时代是唯一的一种宗教？几乎可以说，他们创立了这种宗教。如果你进入他们的圣殿，进入至圣所，甚至来到约柜——那是神的宝座。--- 注意：原文中有一些口语化的表达和非正式的语言，在翻译时我尽量保留了原意的同时使其更加自然流畅。

有基路伯，有天使，面向内，正当你以为会看到一个形象、一个可以触摸的东西、一个能抓住的东西时，不是吗？我们是肉体的生物，我们尝、我们触、我们看、我们闻，我们有感官，我们想要看到一些东西，我们想感受到一些东西。而就在那里，什么也没有。神说：“你们不要在那里放图像。

”我的宝座是空的。你能说出我的话语吗？我们必须接受一个抽象的无形的神，一个我们无法触摸、看不到也闻不到的神，但神却说：“不，不，不，不，你们绝对不能在那里放图像，”但这并不是因为永远不会有一个图像。在《歌罗西书》第一章第十五节，我们读到一段令人惊讶的话：耶稣基督是神的形象，是看不见之神的反映；借着他，万有都得以创造，无论是宝座、权柄、治理者或执政者。

现在，这就是神的意思，神说：“我明白你们为什么想要一个形象。” 我理解你们为什么想要一些可以触摸的东西，并且我会给你们提供这个形象。不要自己去塑造我的形象，因为任何你尝试用来描述我的图像只会让我变得渺小和微不足道，也会使你们变得渺小。但我会给你们**真正的形象，一个活生生的形象——主耶稣基督，他将如此揭示我的荣耀，以至于你会最终能够与之建立联系，他是****真正的人、有血肉的人，是**爱你、流泪、拥抱你的人；最终，他会让你觉得我比你能想象的还要伟大。

不是更渺小，而是更大。为什么？因为这位伟大的神，在我们面前不过是尘埃中的微粒，不过是一颗尘埃，不过是一个原生动物，不过是一个变形虫。没有任何其他图像能够像他那样告诉我们：他来为我们而死，他为原生动物、为变形虫而死。

当你的神是如此之大，以至于他可以变得如此之小的时候，你拥有了一个比想象中更大的神。没有其他宗教有这样的神，没有其他宗教承认神是如此之大，竟然可以变得如此之小。只有拥有这样的神，只有承认耶稣基督是神的形象，并且为我而死，这才真正向我们展示了超越一切的伟大力量——但这不是一种会压垮我们的力量。现在我想为他活着。

现在我不再认为，因为我是遵守所有规则，所以上帝必须对我好。不，他是我的义。他是我的意义所在。我想要更多，现在他是我的生命的意义。

你看，神不能被买来，但我们却可以。神越大，我们也就越大。让我们祷告。我们的天父，我们知道主的晚餐其中一个目的就是它是一种具体的事物，是我们可以用手触摸的东西，它提醒我们你将耶稣基督放在地上作为你的形象——我们的形象，帮助我们理解你的伟大。

只有当我们接受他，记住他所做的一切时，你才会在我们的脑海中呈现出正确的比例。当这一切发生时，我们将获得真正的自由。主啊，求你让我们通过主的晚餐、通过拿起面包和杯子来真正认识你，并使你在我们的眼中、心中成为真实的自己，这样我们才能最终成为真正的自己。奉耶稣基督之名，我们祷告，阿门。
