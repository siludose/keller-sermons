## 引言与经文朗读 / Introduction and Scripture Reading

Welcome to Gospel in Life. Some people say the fundamental problem of the world is poverty. Others say it's bad systems, poor education, or biology, but what if none of these can fully explain the brokenness we see, both in the headlines and in our own hearts?

In today's teaching, Tim Keller looks at how the Bible's teaching on sin gives us a deeply honest and yet incredibly hopeful view of the world. Father, I want to congratulate you for how well you're saying amazing grace. Well, you never choir, we didn't have a trumpet, you know, and you did a great job, and I think it's because after the number of years, the one of the ways you know you're a Christian and you've been a Christian for a while is that your whole life flashes before you when you sing that.

You know, you know, this incredible film of your entire life is sort of biography, A&E biography, but it's you, it's going by, and I know enough of you, and I know enough of your biography is to watch you sing, and I know it's happening to you too. And it's a good mark of a church. This living up to its name when people sing it that well.

Let's look at this passage to which our thoughts have to be focused, and we're going to see Matthew 19, 16 to 25, it's printed in your bulletin, we're going to read that and base our teaching on it, Matthew 19, 16 to 25. Now a man came up to Jesus and asked, teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life? Why do you ask me about what is good Jesus replied, there is only one who is good.

If you want to enter life, obey the commandments, which ones the man inquired? Jesus replied, do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as yourself. All these I have kept, the young man said, what do I still lack?

Jesus answered, if you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven, then come follow me. When the young man heard this, he went away sad because he had great wealth. Then Jesus said to his disciples, I tell you the truth, it's hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.

Again, I tell you, it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God, and then the disciples heard this. They were greatly astonished and asked, who then can be saved? This is God's word.

欢迎来到《福音人生》。有些人说世界的根本问题是贫穷。也有人说是糟糕的制度、教育不良，或是生物因素，但如果这些都不能完全解释我们在新闻头条和自己内心中看到的破碎，那该怎么办呢？

在今天的教导中，提摩太·凯勒探讨圣经关于罪的教导如何给我们一个深刻诚实且充满希望的世界观。天父，我想祝贺你们把《奇异恩典》唱得如此美好。是的，你们不是诗班，我们也没有小号伴奏，你知道的，但你们做得很棒，我想这是因为经过这么多年，你知道自己是基督徒并且做基督徒有一段时间的一个标志，就是当你唱这首歌时，你的整个人生在眼前闪过。

你知道，就像一部关于你整个人生的精彩电影，有点像A&E频道的人物传记，但主角是你，它在播放，我对你们当中足够多的人有所了解，我了解你们的生命故事，看着你们唱歌，我知道这也正发生在你们身上。这是一间教会的好标志，当人们把它唱得那么好时，这间教会就名副其实了。

让我们来看这段我们必须专注的经文，我们要看马太福音19章16到25节，它印在你们的周报上，我们要读这段经文并以此为教导的基础，马太福音19章16到25节。有一个人来见耶稣，问他说："夫子，我该做什么善事才能得永生？"耶稣回答说："你为什么以善事问我呢？只有一位是善的。

你若要进入永生，就当遵守诫命。"他说："什么诫命？"耶稣说："就是不可杀人；不可奸淫；不可偷盗；不可作假见证；当孝敬父母，又当爱人如己。"那少年人说："这一切我都遵守了，还缺少什么呢？"

耶稣说："你若愿意作完全人，可去变卖你所有的，分给穷人，就必有财宝在天上；你还要来跟从我。"那少年人听见这话，就忧忧愁愁地走了，因为他的产业很多。耶稣对门徒说："我实在告诉你们，财主进天国是难的。

我又告诉你们，骆驼穿过针的眼，比财主进神的国还容易呢。"门徒听见这话，就希奇得很，说："这样谁能得救呢？"这是神的话语。

## 那个把一切都安排妥当的人 / The Man Who Had It All Together

This is the very famous story of the rich young ruler, rich young man, and he was rich in two ways. He had both great moral wealth and great financial wealth, you notice? First of all, he has great moral wealth, he's a very decent person, a person characterized by moral excellence.

So when Jesus actually enumerates many of the ten commandments, don't murder, don't commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother, love your neighbor as yourself. He says, bingo. I do that.

Let's assume that he was certainly telling the truth, and that anyone who knew him would say, yes, here is a man characterized by moral excellence. Here is a man who is characterized by sexual purity, he's a loving son, he's a great citizen, he's a man of integrity and honesty. Let's just assume that this is true.

Not only that, we're told he was wealthy, he had many possessions. Back then, as well as now, there's a kind of unconscious, and sometimes conscious, feeling that those two things go together, that if you do good, you'll do well, and if you've done well, it's because you did good. I remember when Maria in Sound of Music, the main character in Sound of Music, was about to marry a rich guy.

She realizes she's going to marry a rich guy. So she sings a song, and she says, somewhere in my youth or childhood, remember? I must have done something good.

I must be a pretty good person, or God wouldn't be rewarding me like this, and of course, this is the reverse of what Job's friend's song, when Job fell into poverty and disease, they essentially said, somewhere in your youth or childhood, you must have done something bad. It must be something wrong. And there's a feeling, it's hard to describe, and nobody wants to articulate it, feeling that if you live a good life, then God will reward you by giving you a certain amount of prosperity.

And so in a sense, you characterized by moral excellence, obviously rewarded by God by being given a prosperous life. And so as he approaches Jesus, it seems like here is the ideal person, any religious leader, any religious leader you can imagine would say, this is the kind of guy I'm looking for. This is the kind of person I want.

Not only is he a man characterized by moral excellence, not only is he a man whose life is varied together in all sorts of ways, but he's even willing to admit there's something he lacks. I mean, this is great to have a rich person who's willing to come to church and to say, I'm still missing something, he's well pulled together in every way, he's got it all together. But even he's so together, he even admits that I don't have it all together.

Yes, I still lack something. So he comes to Jesus and Jesus speaks strong with him and sends him packing. Here's the kind of guy that by modern standards, everybody would say, this is about as together a person as a person can be.

And he's even willing to admit he has a spiritual need and he comes and asks, look, perfectly legitimate question, what do I still lack? There's still something missing in my life spiritually. What do I lack?

And Jesus gives him an outrageous strong answer, sends him away packing, shows him that he's totally outside the kingdom of God. And when the disciples see it, they're absolutely astonished and they say, wait a minute, if he's out, who in the world is in? But this is to teach us, the Christianity is utterly and entirely different than anything the human mind, the natural human mind can conceive of or think.

And what's so alarming is that most of us are going to be in the very same boat. Even those of us who are able to somehow pull our lives together like he did, get ourselves sort of morally together, self-discipline, self-control, economically together, career-wise together. And there's plenty of people in New York who are like that and who still are willing to admit I need something, but obviously it's possible to have all that, even the humility to ask, even the humility to come and seek and be sent packing by Jesus.

Why did he go away? It says, sad. And that's kind of a weak word.

I think the better translation is grieved. He went away grieved. That's how the old translation is to it.

How can we avoid going away grieved? This man had set out on a course of his life that looked like he had made every bit of it. He was just lacking one thing.

He wasn't sure what it is. I mean, he had put his career together. He had built the steps up the mountain and he was almost at a top and he just, when he got to the top, he realized, you know, I've almost made it.

If there was just one more step, I can't quite reach the top. So he turns to Jesus and says, I just need that one more step. Jesus tells him, he's on a completely wrong road that he's far from the kingdom.

How are we going to avoid being sent away by Jesus grieving? In fact, I know, and this is a great thing about Redeemer, there's, there are dozens of you right now, probably in similar situation, oh, maybe not rich and maybe not this together. But you're here saying, what do I lack?

There's a danger that you could be sent away grieving. Why was it he sent away grieving? Why was it?

Why did he go away like that? I would say, unless we understand those, the four reasons I see, we might be in danger of being sent away the same way. So let's take a look, there's four reasons.

Each one is more serious than the last, four reasons that he went away grieving.

这是非常著名的少年财主的故事，这个年轻富人，他在两方面都很富有。他既有巨大的道德财富，也有巨大的经济财富，你注意到了吗？首先，他有巨大的道德财富，他是一个非常正派的人，一个以道德卓越为特征的人。

所以当耶稣实际列举出许多十诫时——不可杀人、不可奸淫、不可偷盗、不可作假见证、当孝敬父母、爱人如己——他说，没问题，我都做到了。

让我们假设他确实说的是实话，任何认识他的人都会说，是的，这是一个以道德卓越为特征的人。这是一个以性纯洁为特征的人，他是个有爱心的儿子，他是个好公民，他是个正直诚实的人。让我们假设这是真的。

不仅如此，我们被告知他很富有，他有很多财产。那时和现在一样，有一种无意识的，有时是有意识的感觉，认为这两件事是相辅相成的，如果你行善，你就会过得好，如果你过得好，那是因为你行了善。我记得在《音乐之声》中，主角玛丽亚即将嫁给一个富人。

她意识到自己要嫁给一个富人了。所以她唱了一首歌，她说，"在我的青春或童年的某个时刻，记得吗？我一定做过什么好事。"

我一定是个相当好的人，否则上帝不会这样奖励我，当然，这与约伯朋友的观点相反，当约伯陷入贫穷和疾病时，他们基本上说，在你的青春或童年的某个时刻，你一定做过什么坏事，一定有什么不对的地方。有一种难以形容的感觉，没有人想要表达出来，那就是如果你过着美好的生活，那么上帝会通过给你一定程度的繁荣来奖励你。

因此从某种意义上说，你以道德卓越为特征，显然被上帝奖励，得到了繁荣的生活。所以当他来到耶稣面前时，似乎这就是理想的人选，任何宗教领袖，你能想象的任何宗教领袖都会说，这就是我要找的那种人，这就是我想要的那种人。

他不仅是一个以道德卓越为特征的人，不仅是一个生活在各方面都井井有条的人，而且他甚至愿意承认自己缺少一些东西。我的意思是，有一个富人愿意来教会并说，我仍然缺少一些东西，这真是太好了，他在各方面都很周全，他把一切都安排妥当了。但即使他如此周全，他甚至承认我并没有把一切都安排妥当。

是的，我仍然缺少一些东西。所以他来到耶稣面前，耶稣对他说了一些严厉的话，把他打发走了。这就是按照现代标准，每个人都会说，这是一个人所能达到的最周全的状态。

他甚至愿意承认自己有属灵需要，他来问，看，这是一个完全合理的问题，我还缺少什么？在我的生命中仍然缺少一些属灵的东西。我缺少什么？

耶稣给了他一个令人震惊的强烈回答，把他打发走了，向他表明他完全在神的国之外。当门徒看到这一幕时，他们绝对震惊了，他们说，等一下，如果他都在外面，那谁在里面呢？但这是要教导我们，基督教与人类思想、自然人类思想所能构想或想到的任何东西都完全不同。

令人震惊的是，我们大多数人都会处于完全相同的境地。即使我们当中那些能够像他那样把生活整理好的人，让自己在道德上整理好，自律、自控，在经济上整理好，在事业上整理好。在纽约有很多这样的人，他们仍然愿意承认我需要一些东西，但显然有可能拥有所有这些，甚至有谦卑去问，甚至有谦卑来寻求，却被耶稣打发走。

他为什么离开？经文说，忧愁。这是一个相当弱的词。

我认为更好的翻译是忧伤。他忧伤地离开了。旧译本就是这样翻译的。

我们如何避免忧伤地离开？这个人为自己的生活设定了一条道路，看起来他已经做到了每一点。他只是缺少一样东西。

他不确定那是什么。我的意思是，他已经把事业整理好了。他已经建好了通往山顶的阶梯，他几乎到达顶峰，当他到达顶峰时，他意识到，你知道，我几乎成功了。

如果只有再多一个台阶，我就能够到达顶端。所以他转向耶稣说，我只需要再多一个台阶。耶稣告诉他，他走在完全错误的道路上，他离天国很远。

我们如何避免被耶稣忧伤地打发走？事实上，我知道，这是救赎主教会的一个很好的特点，现在你们当中有几十个人，可能处于类似的情况，哦，也许不富有，也许没有这么周全。但你们在这里说，我缺少什么？

有一种危险，你可能会被忧伤地打发走。为什么他被忧伤地打发走？为什么？

他为什么那样离开？我想说，除非我们理解我所看到的这四个原因，否则我们可能有被以同样方式打发走的危险。所以让我们看一看，有四个原因。

每一个都比前一个更严重，四个他忧伤离开的原因。

## 他遇见了真正的耶稣 / He Met the Real Jesus

The first reason is, let me just lay these out, and each one is more serious, therefore, each one takes a little bit more thought. The first one is, he went away grieving because he talked to the real Jesus.

Now, I won't take long on this point, but I think you need to say this. One of the reasons why he was disturbed, it was because he was talking to the real Jesus and he was hearing the real message of Jesus. When you talk to the real Jesus, you are always shocked.

When you come up against his real message, you're always disturbed. You're always disturbed. In fact, I'll go this far.

This is the way you grow as a Christian. When you meet the real message of the gospel, you always find two things that are shocking. It demands more than you thought, and it offers more than you thought.

When you meet the real Jesus, you'll find he wants much more from you than you ever thought, and he offers far more to you than you ever dreamed. And frankly, that's what it means to grow. The way you grow as a Christian, the way you know you've grown, is that a year ago, no matter how long you've been a Christian, you're growing a year ago, you were much more ignorant about these two things.

Today, you see far more of what he's requiring. He requires a lot more than you ever thought, but he offers far more than you ever imagined. That's what it means to be dealing with the real Jesus.

And you see, whenever you actually do come up against the real Jesus, what always happens you see that, and then you can only have one of two responses. You can either bow down and wonder and give yourself to him where you go away offended. One or the other.

The other way offended, there's hope, because you could always think about it, at least you've seen the truth, and you might come back. But the one thing it's impossible is to have met the real Jesus and to be indifferent. And if there's anybody here who experiences one of the forms of indifference, in other words, if you find Christianity laughable, irrelevant boring, or if you find Christianity to be just a kind of sweet, comforting thing that it's nice to dip into occasionally.

Or if you find Christianity kind of vaguely guilt-producing and kind of vaguely anxiety-ridden, you haven't seen the real Jesus, because you are in the grip of indifference. Whenever you meet the real Jesus, he disturbs you, and that's the first reason he was disturbed.

---

第一个原因是，让我把这些列出来，每一个都更严重，因此，每一个都需要更多的思考。第一个是，他忧伤离开是因为他与真正的耶稣交谈。

现在，我不会在这一点上花太长时间，但我认为你需要说这一点。他之所以不安，其中一个原因是因为他在与真正的耶稣交谈，他在听耶稣真正的信息。当你与真正的耶稣交谈时，你总是会震惊。

当你遇到他真正的信息时，你总是会不安。你总是会不安。事实上，我要这样说。

这就是你作为基督徒成长的方式。当你遇到福音的真正信息时，你总会发现两件令人震惊的事情。它要求的比你想象的更多，它提供的也比你想象的更多。

当你遇到真正的耶稣时，你会发现他对你的要求远远超过你的想象，他向你提供的也远远超过你的梦想。坦率地说，这就是成长的含义。你作为基督徒成长的方式，你知道自己成长的方式，就是一年前，无论你做基督徒多久，如果你在成长，一年前，你对这两件事的无知要多得多。

今天，你更清楚地看到他的要求。他要求的远比你想象的多，但他提供的也远比你想象的多。这就是与真正的耶稣打交道的意义。

你看，每当你真正遇到真正的耶稣时，总会发生这样的情况，然后你只能有两种反应之一。你可以俯伏敬拜，惊叹不已，把自己献给他，或者你会被冒犯而离开。两者之一。

另一种是被冒犯而离开，这还有希望，因为你至少可以思考一下，至少你看到了真理，你可能会回来。但有一件事是不可能的，那就是遇见真正的耶稣却无动于衷。如果这里有任何人经历某种形式的冷漠，换句话说，如果你发现基督教可笑、无关紧要、无聊，或者如果你发现基督教只是一种甜蜜、安慰的东西，偶尔蘸一下很好。

或者如果你发现基督教有点模糊地产生罪疚感，有点模糊地产生焦虑，你还没有看到真正的耶稣，因为你处于冷漠的掌控之中。每当你遇见真正的耶稣时，他都会扰乱你，这就是他不安的第一个原因。

## 耶稣粉碎了他的宗教假设 / Jesus Smashed His Religious Assumptions

Secondly, the second reason he went away grieving was that Jesus smashed two of his basic assumptions about how religion works.

Jesus smashed his religious views. Now what's really instructive for us is that the religious views that this young man had are not just common in his day, but they're absolutely common today. You see, he came knowing that he was lacking something.

He needed some kind of spiritual experience, at least. He wasn't sure about his relationship with God. He says, what must I do to inherit eternal life?

I don't think he meant he didn't know that he had it. I think it meant he wasn't sure he had it. And he wasn't sure about his relationship with God, and he lacked a certain kind of peace in the center.

So he comes and he asks. And you see, the way he approaches it is based on two assumptions. The way he looks for this peace, it may seem honest.

When you first look at it, it seems very sincere, but the fact of the matter is he is approaching God on the basis of two assumptions that Jesus utterly smashes. And those two assumptions are that Christianity is something you can add and Christianity is something you can do. Christianity is something you can add and you can do.

First of all, people assume he assumed that Christianity was something you can just add to your life, a kind of way of sort of furnishing your life out, filling your life out. It's like you're listening. Let's just say you're a conductor and you're listening to the music and you say, there's one of the notes isn't coming out, you see, one of the lines, I can't hear it.

And a lot of people say, that's what I need. I've had a pretty good life. I need to sort of round myself out.

I need to add something. So he says, what do I still lack? He goes to Jesus and says, what can I add?

But Jesus' response, as we will see later, is to make an outrageous request. And what he's really doing, what Jesus is really doing is saying, this Christianity is not something you add. Christianity is more like an explosion that destroys everything you have to make way for something new.

Christianity isn't something you add. Christianity is starting completely afresh. Remember Nicodemus?

He was also, and he wasn't a rich young man. He was a rich old man. And he said, he comes to Jesus by night, John chapter three, and he says, essentially, he says the same thing.

He says, you're a good teacher. And I'm a ruler in Israel. But I just feel like I lack something.

What do I still lack? And Jesus goes, boom, you must be born again. You must be completely redone.

Everything has to be smashed. Young man, he's saying, you don't need one more rung to get over the top of the mountain. What I have, revolutionizes everything.

What I have, smashes through the mountain, it's a whole new approach. And so what really Jesus is saying is, utterly Christianity is not something you add. It's something that completely revolutionizes.

But then, the other assumption, you can't just bring Jesus Christ in as an addition. He doesn't just furnish you out. He's not another book on your shelf.

Okay. He's not another file on your hard drive, you know, that just somehow gives you more power. You know, he's not, he's not something you just add and say, wow, look how much more powerful my program is now.

Oh no. Oh no. He's a whole new program.

He doesn't just add and boot up your program. But then the second thing that the young man does is he thinks that Christianity is something you do. He says, what good thing should I do?

And Jesus again, is absolutely blunt. He says, there's only one good. And in a minute, we'll see, he also asked the man to do something that is utterly impossible.

In other words, Jesus Christ says, I want you to know that it's getting to God is not a matter of goodness. Nobody can be good enough, nobody can be moral enough. And then look at the furious logic.

He says, take all of your wealth, O rich man, and sell it all and give it to the poor and follow me. What is he doing? It's brilliant.

He says, oh, you will be all the ten commandments, do you? Well, let's just start with the first one. Let's just take the first one.

The first one is, you see, love God with all your heart, soul strength in mind, have no other guys before me. All right. He says, let's try that one out.

I want you to sell all of your money just because I, Jesus Christ, the Lord say so. How are you doing? He says, you see, if you God is really first in your life, everything in anything else is trivial compared to God.

Everything in anything else is a bobble, it's a trinket. Nothing is compared to his cause, nothing is compared to his heart, nothing. Do you have any other guys before you?

Before him? How does your heart work? You see, what is he doing?

He's saying, my dear friend, nobody loves God with all their heart, soul strength in mind. Nobody loves their neighbor as themselves. Don't you see?

Your problem, O rich young man, is not that you need a little more goodness. Your problem is you won't admit what you know down deep that you're not good. And I can almost hear Jesus saying this.

He's saying, the reason you come to me is because you know at some level that you're not good. Take a look at a needle, just get some sewing needle and look at it with a naked eye, and it looks perfect, stainless, pure, spotless, brilliant, bright, but look at it under a microscope and it's all pocked and misshapen. Now anybody who gets close enough into a heart will see the same thing.

One is a young minister, years ago, I made a terrible mistake, very often I would do funerals and I very often did funerals for fine Christian men or women. And from what I can tell, you know from my naked eye, when I looked at them from where I could see them, they looked just perfect, they were wonderful men and women have got. So I would do these glowing funeral sermons about how great this person was in the self-control and the love and the ability and the wisdom I would watch the family, you know, squirming their seats.

Because if you look close enough at any heart, any human heart, it's all misshapen, it's all pocked. And the rich young man knew that, he wouldn't admit it to himself, Jesus is trying to break on through, no one is good. You think Christianity is something you add, no, it's a revolution, you think Christianity is something you do, no, it's something you receive.

Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty and heartache. We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way and what can be done about it?

In his brand new book that's releasing this month, what is wrong with the world, Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer. Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer, Dr. Keller shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing.

Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes or choices or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world will help you see how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us. This newly released book, What Is Wrong with the World is our thanks for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the good news of Jesus. Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash give.

That's gospelandlife.com slash give. Now here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching.

And so you got to move on here, but let me put it to you this way. Every other religion in the world, every other philosophy in the world and every actually even so-called common sense divides all humanity like this, like this. See it?

Up here is the good, down here is the bad, hmm? Up here is the moral, down here is the immoral, hmm? Up here is the nice, down here is the nasty.

There's the religious, maybe down here is the irreligious, depends a little bit, but basically everybody sees that that's the line. And Jesus comes through and says, no, the real line isn't a horizontal line, the real line is a vertical line. And he says, I want you to know that there's really two ways to God.

Both nice and nasty people can do it on their own efforts or both nice and nasty people no matter what you've done, no matter who you are, no matter how great, no matter how awful you can come on a totally different basis. You can come on the basis, not of your efforts, but on the basis of my efforts until you see that the real line going down the center of humanity in its attitude and its stance toward God is not the horizontal, but the vertical. The vertical is the real one.

It cuts across the horizontal, it makes minced meat of the horizontal on either side because no matter how good you are on this side, Jesus says, you're not. It's only relative. You're just a little less pocked and misshapen, no matter how far, and no matter how bad you are on this side, as we'll see in a minute, you can come.

In other words, this young man is good relatively speaking, relative to other people, he's very good, it's his doctrine of goodness that's wrong. And as a result, he goes away grieving. Jesus has smashed his assumptions.

These assumptions that virtually everybody else has, too. Thirdly, the reason he went away grieving was because he was talking to the real Jesus. Secondly, because Jesus smashed his religious assumptions.

其次，他忧伤离开的第二个原因是耶稣粉碎了他关于宗教如何运作的两个基本假设。

耶稣粉碎了他的宗教观念。现在对我们来说真正有启发意义的是，这个年轻人所持有的宗教观念不仅在他那个时代很普遍，而且在今天也绝对普遍。你看，他来的时候知道自己缺少一些东西。

他至少需要某种属灵体验。他不确定自己与神的关系。他说，我该做什么才能承受永生？

我不认为他的意思是他不知道自己有没有。我认为他的意思是他不确定自己有没有。他不确定自己与神的关系，他在内心深处缺乏某种平安。

所以他来问。你看，他接近这个问题的方式是基于两个假设。他寻找这种平安的方式，乍一看似乎很诚实。

当你第一次看它时，它似乎非常真诚，但事实是他接近神的方式是基于两个假设，而耶稣完全粉碎了这两个假设。这两个假设是：基督教是你可以添加的东西，基督教是你可以做的东西。基督教是你可以添加和可以做的东西。

首先，人们假设——他假设基督教是你可以添加到生活中的东西，一种装饰你的生活、充实你的生活的方式。就像你在听——比如说你是一个指挥，你在听音乐，你说，有一个音符没有出来，你看，其中一个声部，我听不到。

很多人说，这就是我需要的。我过着相当好的生活。我需要让自己变得更全面。

我需要添加一些东西。所以他说，我还缺少什么？他去找耶稣说，我可以添加什么？

但耶稣的回应，正如我们稍后将看到的，是提出一个令人震惊的要求。他真正在做的，耶稣真正在做的是说，这个基督教不是你添加的东西。基督教更像是一场摧毁你所拥有的一切的爆炸，为新的东西腾出空间。

基督教不是你添加的东西。基督教是完全重新开始。还记得尼哥底母吗？

他也是，他不是一个年轻的富人。他是一个年老的富人。他说，他在夜里来见耶稣，约翰福音第三章，他基本上说，他说同样的话。

他说，你是一位好老师。我是以色列的官。但我只是觉得我缺少一些东西。

我还缺少什么？耶稣说，砰，你必须重生。你必须完全重做。

一切都必须被粉碎。年轻人，他在说，你不需要再多一个梯级就能越过山顶。我所拥有的，彻底改变一切。

我所拥有的，穿透山脉，这是一个全新的方法。所以耶稣真正在说的是，完全地，基督教不是你添加的东西。它是完全革命性的东西。

但是，另一个假设是，你不能只是把耶稣基督作为一个附加物带进来。他不只是装饰你。他不是你书架上的另一本书。

好吧。他不是你硬盘上的另一个文件，你知道，只是以某种方式给你更多的力量。你知道，他不是，他不是你只是添加的东西，然后说，哇，看我的程序现在有多强大。

哦不。哦不。他是一个全新的程序。

他不只是添加和启动你的程序。但接下来年轻人做的第二件事是他认为基督教是你做的东西。他说，我该做什么善事？

耶稣再次绝对直率。他说，只有一位是善的。一会儿我们会看到，他还要求这个人做一些完全不可能的事情。

换句话说，耶稣基督说，我要你知道到达神那里不是一个善良的问题。没有人能够足够好，没有人能够足够有道德。然后看这个猛烈的逻辑。

他说，拿走你所有的财富，哦富人，把它全部卖掉，分给穷人，然后跟从我。他在做什么？这太精彩了。

他说，哦，你遵守了所有的十诫，是吗？好吧，让我们从第一条开始。让我们只取第一条。

你看，第一条是，尽心、尽性、尽力、尽意爱主你的神，除了我以外你不可有别的神。好吧。他说，让我们试试那一条。

我要你把所有的钱都卖掉，只是因为我，耶稣基督，主这样说。你做得怎么样？他说，你看，如果神真的在你生命中居首位，其他一切与神相比都微不足道。

其他一切与神相比都是小玩意，都是小装饰品。没有什么能与他的事业相比，没有什么能与他的心相比，什么都没有。你在他之前有别的神吗？

在他之前？你的心是如何运作的？你看，他在做什么？

他在说，我亲爱的朋友，没有人尽心、尽性、尽力、尽意爱神。没有人像爱自己一样爱邻舍。你不明白吗？

哦，少年财主，你的问题不是你需要多一点善良。你的问题是你不愿意承认你内心深处知道的——你不好。我几乎能听到耶稣这样说。

他在说，你来找我的原因是因为你在某个层面上知道你不好。拿一根针，拿一根缝衣针，用肉眼看它，它看起来完美、无瑕、纯净、无斑点、明亮、光辉，但在显微镜下看它，它全是坑坑洼洼、畸形不正的。现在任何足够接近内心的人都会看到同样的事情。

我曾是一个年轻的牧师，多年前，我犯了一个可怕的错误，我经常主持葬礼，我经常为优秀的基督徒男人或女人主持葬礼。据我所知，你知道从我的肉眼来看，当我从我能看到的地方看他们时，他们看起来完美无瑕，他们是神奇妙的男人和女人。所以我会做这些赞美的葬礼布道，讲述这个人在自制、爱心、能力和智慧方面有多伟大，我会看着家人，你知道，在座位上扭动不安。

因为如果你足够近地观察任何人的心，任何人的心，它都是畸形不正的，都是坑坑洼洼的。而这个少年财主知道这一点，他不愿意对自己承认这一点，耶稣试图突破，没有人是善的。你认为基督教是你添加的东西，不，它是一场革命，你认为基督教是你做的东西，不，它是你接受的东西。

我们到处看到的都是破碎，战争、残酷和心痛。我们在周围的世界和我们自己的生活中都感受到了这一点。它是怎么变成这样的，我们能做些什么？

在他本月发行的全新书籍《世界出了什么问题》中，提摩太·凯勒提供了一个清晰而富有同情心的答案。从在救赎主教会的一系列教导中提炼出来，凯勒博士展示了罪的现实如何解释我们在周围看到的痛苦，以及只有福音才能提供持久的自由和医治。

无论你是被我们世界的状况所压倒，还是在挣扎自己的错误或选择，或者在寻找希望和喜乐，《世界出了什么问题》都将帮助你看到福音如何既对我们世界的心痛，也对我们每个人内心的痛��问话。这本新发行的书《世界出了什么问题》是我们对你本月捐赠的感谢，帮助《福音与生命》分享耶稣的好消息。今天就在gospelandlife.com/give上索取你的副本。

就是gospelandlife.com/give。现在这里是凯勒博士今天教导的其余部分。

所以你必须继续往下，但让我这样对你说。世界上每一个其他宗教，世界上每一个其他哲学，实际上甚至所谓的常识，都像这样划分所有人类，像这样。看到了吗？

上面是好人，下面是坏人，嗯？上面是有道德的，下面是不道德的，嗯？上面是好的，下面是坏的。

上面是有宗教的，也许下面是没有宗教的，这取决于具体情况，但基本上每个人都看到这是界线。耶稣来了，说，不，真正的界线不是一条水平线，真正的界线是一条垂直线。他说，我要你知道，到神那里真的有两种方式。

好人和坏人都可以靠自己的努力去，或者好人和坏人，无论你做过什么，无论你是谁，无论你多伟大，无论你多糟糕，你都可以在一个完全不同的基础上来。你可以来，不是基于你的努力，而是基于我的努力，直到你看到人类对神的态度和立场的真正界线不是水平的，而是垂直的。垂直线才是真正的线。

它穿过水平线，它把水平线切成碎片，两边都是，因为无论你在这边有多好，耶稣说，你不是。这只是相对的。你只是稍微少一点坑坑洼洼、畸形不正，无论你在这边有多远，无论你有多坏，正如我们马上会看到的，你都可以来。

换句话说，这个年轻人相对而言是好的，相对于其他人，他非常好,但他的善良教义是错误的。因此，他忧伤地离开了。耶稣粉碎了他的假设。

这些假设几乎其他所有人也都有。第三，他忧伤离开的原因是他在与真正的耶稣交谈。第二，因为耶稣粉碎了他的宗教假设。

## 耶稣触及个人：交出你的梦想 / Jesus Got Personal: Surrender Your Dreams

Thirdly, he went away grieving because Jesus got personal. Now I would suggest to you that even though Jesus has contradicted his views, that's not the real reason that he is so grieved. No.

Jesus refused to stay academic. This young man is like so many people. I've seen it for years.

He believes, essentially, his problem is an academic one. He says, I'm missing something. I don't know why, I feel, I don't know why, I feel kind of like there's something wrong.

I'm missing something. Is it a doctrine that I have missed or don't understand? Is some project I ought to do that I don't know about, or is it some rule that I'm breaking that I don't know about?

What is it? He's essentially saying, it's something I'm missing, something I'm missing in my thinking, and he approaches it academically, and Jesus will not have it. I've seen this for years.

People say, my real problem with Christianity is, I don't see how a God of love could punish people. Or you say, my real problem with Christianity is, I just don't like it so exclusive, it seems to leave out other religions. That's my problem.

Or you might say, my real problem is the whole idea of miracle. I just can't believe I was a modern person in miracle. Or you may say, well, you can even get a little less academic and you say, my real problem is I have a bad habit and I can't break it, or I've got an issue that I just can't seem to deal with.

Or I've got something that I'm caught in and I don't know what I want to, you know, I don't know that I really want to give it up or I don't know how to get out of it. So you get a little bit less academic, but Jesus Christ, see, the rich young man is like this, but he has come to Jesus Christ who has the eye that pierces all the way through all the smokescreens, all the pretence, all the camouflage, all the posturing. And you know, in Mark, in Gospel of Mark, this same story is told, and Mark inserts something very important in this story, you see, you know the place where he says, what still do I lack?

In the Gospel of Mark, he says, what still do I lack? And Mark says, Jesus looked at him and loved him and said, sell everything you've got. He looked at him and loved him.

Now what's that mean? It means he wasn't just looking at his face. It means he was reading his soul like a book.

It means he said, I know this is going to hurt you, but I want you to know that I see the real cancer, I see the real issue, I see the real thing that's killing you. You've got to get rid of all your money. Now, the only way to understand what Jesus is doing is to put this in context.

There is nobody else in the Bible who is, as far as I know, who is asked to give up everything like that. Even Zacchaeus was only asked to give away half. In other words, there's no rule that says all Christians to follow Christ have got to give up everything, all their money.

There's no place that says you have to sell all your money and go into complete poverty. There's no place that says that. So that means the way he's dealing with this young man is he's doing a drastic measure of the way you deal with an alcoholic or a gambler.

What Jesus is saying is, our difficulty, underneath all of our objections and underneath all our complaints, the difficulty we really have is never the difficulty we really think at first. Everybody I know who's really gone very far in the Christian life has found this out, that what we thought in the beginning was the problem really isn't. Jesus Christ comes all the way in and says, underneath at all, there is a power struggle that you have with God over your dreams.

Carousel. Musical. There's one place where one of the characters, Kerry Pippridge, sings a song about how she can't wait to be married and have children.

That's her great dream. And you know, she sings one of the most lyrical of all to ask her Hamirstine Rodgers songs. She sings, when the children are asleep will sit in dream.

But the night she sang that song, if Jesus Christ had come down to the middle of a carousel, he'd walk over to Kerry Pippridge and he'd say, there's one thing that you lack. I want you to be willing to live a single life, all of your life for me. That's what he would do.

He comes to Abraham and says, I want you to take your son, your only son, whom you love and offer him up as a burn offering. He comes to the rich young man and says, you've got to give away all of your money. What is he doing?

Jesus Christ is saying, I want your dreams. There's a song that we sing in the evening service, starts Holy Father. You know that song?

Some of you do. Some of you come. And the main part of it's a short song, but the main part is we have to surrender all our dreams.

And what Jesus Christ says is, I want the most important thing in your life. That is the running sore. That is the cancer.

I want your dream. I want that through which you dream of a life of power and joy without God. I want the thing that you think will give you a life of power and joy without God.

And until you have given it to me, not only we aren't right, but you don't know it, it's killing you. The village voice, at the end of January, there was an article that made an awful lot of, made a big flap, kind of a lot of publicity. And the reason it was, it did, was because it was about the fact that unsafe sexes on the rise again in big cities.

And the person who wrote, the writer who wrote it, wrote as a person who had begun to get back into unsafe sex. And at one point, the writer said this. The writer said, at first I was shocked at what I was doing, quote, I recoiled so much from what I had done that it seemed to be not my choice at all.

It was like a monster did it. I recoiled so much from what I had done that it seemed to be not to be my choice at all. It was like a monster did it.

But when you read through the article, at the end, the reflection goes on, and here's how it ends. Yes, if you want to stay alive, you have to avoid wild anonymous, spontaneous, and explosive sex. Then you have to ask, who are you?

What is life about? Now listen, because I'm not picking on sex as the greatest evil, just like Jesus is not picking on money as the greatest evil. I'm not using this illustration because I'm a conservative and Jesus isn't using his illustration because he's a liberal.

The point is, anything that you have decided will give me a life of joy and power without God becomes a monster. It does drive you. It takes you out.

Jesus looks at this and says, this is your monster. Jesus says anything, the reason he loves him when he says that he says, I have to tell you this. I know it's going to hurt, but I love you.

And the reason I'm telling you is, this is how you think you can have a life of power and joy without God. As a result, we've got to kill this thing before it kills you. The reason your life is out of control is because you're afraid of losing control to God.

He says, give it to me and let me decide how much money you're going to have. Put me first. Be willing to part with anything, anything, change your attitude toward this.

Be willing to part with anything, anything, so he's saying to this man, he says, be willing to walk away from it all. And let me decide how rich you're going to be. He says to carry pepperage, be willing to not be married at all.

Let me decide that. He says to Abraham, be willing to not have any child. We think the problem's academic.

We think the problem's superficial. We think the problem's behavioral is there's a monster at the heart. Jesus says, surrender your dreams.

Money can be a monster. Money is so dangerous spiritually that even not having it can destroy you because of your envy and your desire and you can kill yourself to get it. But the point is, it's not the money or the sex or the work per se as such.

But it's money or sex that comes before Jesus. That's what Jesus is. It's money or sex or work as your fondest dream, as your deepest dream.

Jesus, I want it. You know how money can do it? I've seen people who don't have money.

But if money is the way that they dream of a life of perfect control, we will use money because we feel like it will give us a life of power. We'll be in charge of our lives. We'll feel in control finally.

People won't push us around. If you don't have it, the monster of money will fill you with anxiety. It will fill you with bitterness toward other people who have more than you.

It will fill you with envy. It will always make you worry about money. It will make you work too hard.

It will make you trample on people. It was amazing how the new talk shows are pushing people into conflict. People will watch the talk shows that make people embarrassed and fight.

When recently somebody shot somebody after a talk show, the media called up, the newspaper media called all the talk show and said, why are you still doing this? They said because people watch it, which means because people buy it, which means, yeah, it's bad, but it makes us money. It's become a monster.

Yeah, we're trampling on people, but it makes us money. And you know what's the worst thing that can happen is when you actually get the money. When you become rich, you feel that it's because you're smart, because you're savvy, and you get very confident about your hunches, and you get very confident about your beliefs.

It's become a monster. Anything will. Jesus says, yes, you lack one thing.

And what is that? Here's the end.

第三，他忧伤离开是因为耶稣触及了个人层面。现在我要向你建议，尽管耶稣反驳了他的观点，但这并不是他如此忧伤的真正原因。不是的。

耶稣拒绝停留在学术层面。这个年轻人像很多人一样。我多年来一直看到这一点。

他相信，本质上，他的问题是一个学术问题。他说，我缺少一些东西。我不知道为什么，我感觉，我不知道为什么，我感觉好像有什么不对。

我缺少一些东西。是我错过或不理解的某个教义吗？是我应该做但不知道的某个项目吗，还是我在违反但不知道的某个规则？

是什么？他本质上在说，这是我缺少的东西，我思想中缺少的东西，他从学术角度接近它，耶稣不会接受这个。我多年来一直看到这一点。

人们说，我对基督教真正的问题是，我不明白一个有爱的神怎么会惩罚人。或者你说，我对基督教真正的问题是，我只是不喜欢它如此排他，它似乎把其他宗教排除在外。这是我的问题。

或者你可能会说，我真正的问题是整个神迹的概念。我只是不能相信我是一个现代人相信神迹。或者你可能会说，嗯，你甚至可以变得不那么学术化，你说，我真正的问题是我有一个坏习惯，我无法改掉它，或者我有一个我似乎无法处理的问题。

或者我被困在某件事中，我不知道我想要什么，你知道，我不知道我真的想放弃它还是我不知道如何摆脱它。所以你变得不那么学术化，但耶稣基督，你看，这个少年财主就是这样，但他来到了耶稣基督面前，他的眼睛能穿透所有的烟幕、所有的伪装、所有的掩饰、所有的姿态。你知道，在马可福音中，同样的故事被讲述，马可在这个故事中插入了一些非常重要的东西，你看，你知道他说，我还缺少什么的地方吗？

在马可福音中，他说，我还缺少什么？马可说，耶稣看着他，爱他，说，变卖你所有的一切。他看着他，爱他。

现在这是什么意思？这意味着他不只是看着他的脸。这意味着他像读一本书一样读他的灵魂。

这意味着他说，我知道这会伤害你，但我要你知道，我看到了真正的癌症，我看到了真正的问题，我看到了真正杀死你的东西。你必须摆脱所有的钱。现在，理解耶稣在做什么的唯一方法是把这放在背景中。

据我所知，圣经中没有其他人像这样被要求放弃一切。甚至撒该也只被要求捐出一半。换句话说，没有规则说所有基督徒要跟从基督就必须放弃一切，所有的钱。

没有地方说你必须卖掉所有的钱，陷入完全的贫困。没有地方这样说。所以这意味着他对待这个年轻人的方式，他采取的是对待酗酒者或赌徒的激烈措施。

耶稣在说的是，我们的困难，在我们所有的反对和所有的抱怨之下，我们真正遇到的困难永远不是我们一开始真正认为的困难。我认识的每一个在基督徒生活中真正走得很远的人都发现了这一点，我们一开始认为的问题实际上不是。耶稣基督一直深入进来说，在这一切之下，你与神之间有一场关于你梦想的权力斗争。

旋转木马。音乐剧。有一个地方，其中一个角色，凯丽·皮普里奇，唱了一首歌，讲述她多么迫不及待想结婚生子。

这是她的伟大梦想。你知道，她唱的是罗杰斯和汉默斯坦所有歌曲中最抒情的歌曲之一。她唱道，"当孩子们睡着时，我们会坐下来做梦。"

但她唱那首歌的那天晚上，如果耶稣基督降临到旋转木马的中间，他会走向凯丽·皮普里奇，他会说，有一件事你缺少。我要你愿意为我过一生单身的生活。这就是他会做的。

他来到亚伯拉罕面前说，我要你把你的儿子，你唯一的儿子，你所爱的儿子，献上作为燔祭。他来到少年财主面前说，你必须捐出你所有的钱。他在做什么？

耶稣基督在说，我要你的梦想。我们在晚上崇拜时唱一首歌，开头是"圣洁的天父"。你知道那首歌吗？

你们有些人知道。你们有些人来。它的主要部分是一首短歌，但主要部分是我们必须交出所有的梦想。

耶稣基督说的是，我要你生命中最重要的东西。那是化脓的伤口。那是癌症。

我要你的梦想。我要那个你梦想着没有神也能有力量和喜乐的生活的东西。我要那个你认为会给你没有神的力量和喜乐生活的东西。

除非你把它交给我，否则我们不仅不对，而且你不知道，它正在杀死你。《乡村之声》，一月底，有一篇文章引起了很大的轰动，得到了很多宣传。它之所以引起轰动，是因为它是关于在大城市中不安全性行为再次兴起的事实。

写这篇文章的作者以一个已经开始重新进行不安全性行为的人的身份写作。在某一点上，作者说了这样的话。作者说，起初我对自己所做的感到震惊，引用，"我对自己所做的事如此反感，以至于它似乎根本不是我的选择。"

就像一个怪物做的。我对自己所做的事如此反感，以至于它似乎根本不是我的选择。就像一个怪物做的。

但当你通读文章到最后时，反思继续，这是它的结尾。是的，如果你想活下去，你必须避免狂野的、匿名的、自发的和爆炸性的性行为。然后你必须问，你是谁？

生命是什么？现在听着，因为我不是把性挑出来作为最大的罪恶，就像耶稣不是把金钱挑出来作为最大的罪恶一样。我使用这个例子不是因为我是保守派，耶稣使用他的例子也不是因为他是自由派。

关键是，你决定会给你没有神的喜乐和力量生活的任何东西都会成为一个怪物。它确实驱使你。它控制你。

耶稣看着这个说，这是你的怪物。耶稣说任何东西，他爱他的时候说这话的原因，他说，我必须告诉你这个。我知道这会伤害你，但我爱你。

我告诉你的原因是，这就是你认为可以没有神而拥有力量和喜乐生活的方式。因此，我们必须在这东西杀死你之前杀死它。你的生活失控的原因是因为你害怕失去对神的控制。

他说，把它交给我，让我决定你要有多少钱。把我放在首位。愿意放弃任何东西，任何东西，改变你对此的态度。

愿意放弃任何东西，任何东西，所以他对这个人说，他说，愿意从这一切中走开。让我决定你要有多富有。他对凯丽·皮普里奇说，愿意根本不结婚。

让我决定。他对亚伯拉罕说，愿意没有任何孩子。我们认为问题是学术性的。

我们认为问题是表面的。我们认为问题是行为上的，但在内心深处有一个怪物。耶稣说，交出你的梦想。

金钱可以成为一个怪物。金钱在属灵上是如此危险，以至于即使没有它也会因为你的嫉妒和欲望而毁掉你，你可以为了得到它而杀死自己。但关键是，金钱或性或工作本身并不是问题。

而是在耶稣之前的金钱或性。这就是耶稣所说的。是作为你最大梦想、最深梦想的金钱或性或工作。

耶稣，我要它。你知道金钱是怎么做到的吗？我见过没有钱的人。

但如果金钱是他们梦想完美控制生活的方式，我们会使用金钱，因为我们觉得它会给我们一种力量的生活。我们会掌控自己的生活。我们最终会感到有控制感。

人们不会推我们。如果你没有它，金钱的怪物会让你充满焦虑。它会让你对拥有比你更多的人充满苦毒。

它会让你充满嫉妒。它总是会让你担心金钱。它会让你工作过度。

它会让你践踏别人。令人惊讶的是新的脱口秀节目如何推动人们陷入冲突。人们会观看让人尴尬和争吵的脱口秀节目。

最近有人在脱口秀节目后开枪打死了某人，媒体、报纸媒体打电话给所有的脱口秀节目说，你们为什么还在做这个？他们说因为人们看它，这意味着因为人们买它，这意味着，是的，这很糟糕，但它给我们赚钱。它已经成为一个怪物。

是的，我们在践踏人，但它给我们赚钱。你知道最糟糕的事情是什么吗？是当你真的得到钱的时候。当你变得富有时，你觉得那是因为你聪明，因为你精明，你对自己的直觉变得非常自信，你对自己的信念变得非常自信。

它已经成为一个怪物。任何东西都会。耶稣说，是的，你缺少一样东西。

那是什么？这是结尾。

## 天上的财宝：他是你的，你是他的 / Treasure in Heaven: He Is Yours and You Are His

The fourth reason, see, he does lack one thing, it's not the giving away of the money.

It's treasure in heaven. The reason that this young man has missed it all is because he doesn't understand treasure in heaven. And Jesus Christ comes and says, you have to get rid of your monster.

You have to put me first, and that's the only way you'll ever get treasures in heaven. Oh, what are treasures in heaven? It means these two things, I have to really be brief here.

Number one, it means to see that he is your treasure in heaven. Jesus is really saying is, I want you to give away everything. What he means is, I want you to see that if you have me and only me, you're rich.

And not just rich toward people, rich toward God. He's saying, young man, I know that you have the greatest estate in the district, but it's nothing compared to my forgiveness. It's nothing compared to my righteousness.

It's nothing compared to being adopted into the family of the Father. It's nothing compared to what I can give you. Don't you see?

Theaves can steal it, moth and rust can corrupt it, but what I give you is permanent. And if you don't see that I alone am good, but that as your Savior, if you rely on me for your standing before God, you become good in me. You'll see that I'm your treasure, I'm your righteousness, I'm your record before God.

And if you have that, then it changes your attitude toward everything, money no longer sacred. It's nothing compared to the treasure in heaven. You're free from worry, you're free from envy, you're free for generosity.

But that's not it. The last thing is, if you want to understand treasure in heaven, you have to see that he is your treasure in heaven, but lastly, you have to understand that you're his treasure in heaven. Jesus says when he sends his disciples out, they come back and they've been casting demons out.

And they say, this is great. We're doing miracles. And he says, rejoice not that the demons are subject to you, but rejoice that your name is written in heaven.

Oh, where's their name written in heaven? Well, the Bible tells us in the Old Testament that the high priest who went in before God used to had the names of every one of the children of Israel engraved on precious stones over his heart when he went before God. And Jesus is our high priest.

And in Isaiah 49, God says to Israel, can a woman forget the woman, can a woman forget the baby that nurses at her breast, she may forget, but I will not forget the, look, I've engraved you on the palms of my hands. If you put a tattoo here, you won't always see it. If you put a tattoo here, you won't always see, if you put a tattoo here, you won't obviously but if you put a tattoo here, what is God saying?

He was saying, if you make my son your treasure, that makes you my treasure. Now when I see you, I see an absolute beauty, I see you radiant in Christ, I see you righteous in Christ, I dot on you, I gaze on you. Is that the most exhilarating thought you can possibly have?

Is that if you live in holy consciousness of this or do you take your identity from your bank account or your dress size, don't you see the freedom that comes? Jesus says, you will only be free if you see that with me and me alone, you're rich. And as John Newton once put it, since I have known the Savior's name and what for me he bore, no more I toil for empty fame, I thirst for gold no more, placed by his hand in this retreat, I make his love my theme and see that all the world calls great, his butt a waking dream.

If you come to him even though he's grieving you, you'll see he really loves you. Let's pray. Our Father, we ask that you would teach us not just how to be free from greed but how to be free, period by seeing what your son has asked us for, everything.

We look at you and we say, oh Lord Jesus Christ, we thought you were a great teacher, we thought you were a great moralist, we came expecting a little additional help, we see that you have to be our surety, our mediator, you have to be our prophet, our priest, our king, our Alpha, our Omega, our everything and we ask that you would let that be the case, thereby we will find the freedom that comes only to those who have submitted holy and utterly to your son as their Lord and Savior in his name we pray. Amen. Thanks for listening to Tim Keller on the Gospel and Life podcast.

第四个原因，你看，他确实缺少一样东西，不是捐出金钱。

是天上的财宝。这个年轻人错过一切的原因是因为他不理解天上的财宝。耶稣基督来说，你必须摆脱你的怪物。

你必须把我放在首位，这是你得到天上财宝的唯一方法。哦，什么是天上的财宝？它意味着这两件事，我必须在这里非常简短。

第一，它意味着看到他是你在天上的财宝。耶稣真正在说的是，我要你放弃一切。他的意思是，我要你看到，如果你拥有我，只有我，你就富有了。

不只是对人富有，对神富有。他在说，年轻人，我知道你在这个地区拥有最大的产业，但与我的赦免相比，那算不了什么。与我的义相比，那算不了什么。

与被收养进入天父的家庭相比，那算不了什么。与我能给你的相比，那算不了什么。你不明白吗？

贼可以偷走它，虫子和锈可以腐蚀它，但我给你的是永久的。如果你不明白只有我是善的，但作为你的救主，如果你依靠我在神面前的地位，你在我里面变得良善。你会看到我是你的财宝，我是你的义，我是你在神面前的记录。

如果你有那个，那么它就改变了你对一切的态度，金钱不再神圣。与天上的财宝相比，它什么都不是。你不再担心，你不再嫉妒，你可以自由地慷慨。

但这还不是全部。最后一件事是，如果你想理解天上的财宝，你必须看到他是你在天上的财宝，但最后，你必须理解你是他在天上的财宝。耶稣说，当他差遣门徒出去时，他们回来了，他们一直在赶鬼。

他们说，这太棒了。我们在行神迹。他说，不要因鬼服了你们就欢喜，要因你们的名记录在天上欢喜。

哦，他们的名字写在天上哪里？嗯，圣经在旧约中告诉我们，进到神面前的大祭司过去在心口上刻着以色列每一个儿女的名字在宝石上，当他进到神面前时。耶稣是我们的大祭司。

在以赛亚书49章，神对以色列说，妇人焉能忘记她吃奶的婴孩，不怜恤她所生的儿子？即或有忘记的，我却不忘记你。看哪，我将你铭刻在我掌上。如果你在这里纹一个纹身，你不会总是看到它。如果你在这里纹一个纹身，你不会总是看到，如果你在这里纹一个纹身，你显然不会，但如果你在这里纹一个纹身，神在说什么？

他在说，如果你让我的儿子成为你的财宝，那就让你成为我的财宝。现在当我看到你时，我看到绝对的美丽，我看到你在基督里光芒四射，我看到你在基督里是义的，我宠爱你，我凝视你。这是你能想到的最令人振奋的想法吗？

这就是，如果你活在对此的神圣意识中，或者你从你的银行账户或你的衣服尺码中获取你的身份，你不明白随之而来的自由吗？耶稣说，只有当你看到只有我和只有我在一起，你才富有，你才会自由。正如约翰·牛顿曾经说的那样，"自从我知道救主的名，知道他为我所承受的，我不再为虚空的名声劳苦，我不再渴求黄金，被他的手安置在这个隐居之所，我以他的爱为主题，看到世界所谓的伟大，不过是一场清醒的梦。"

如果你来到他面前，即使他让你忧伤，你会看到他真的爱你。让我们祷告。我们的父，我们祈求你教导我们不只是如何从贪婪中得自由，而是如何完全得自由，通过看到你的儿子对我们的要求——一切。

我们看着你说，哦主耶稣基督，我们以为你是一位伟大的教师，我们以为你是一位伟大的道德家，我们来期待一点额外的帮助，我们看到你必须成为我们的保证人、我们的中保，你必须成为我们的先知、我们的祭司、我们的王、我们的阿拉法、我们的俄梅戛、我们的一切，我们祈求你让这成为现实，因此我们将找到只有那些神圣地、完全地顺服你的儿子作为他们的主和救主的人才能找到的自由。奉他的名我们祷告。阿们。感谢收听提摩太·凯勒在《福音与生命》播客上的信息。
