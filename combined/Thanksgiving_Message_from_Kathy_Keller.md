#### Introduction: Thanksgiving and God's Provision

Hi, I'm Kathy Keller. Each year when we get to Thanksgiving, we pause to recognize all the ways God has been so gracious in His provision, both for our basic physical needs and for the ways that He provides for us spiritually to give us joy, hope, and renewal through His Son Jesus Christ. #### The Importance of Focusing on God

Thanksgiving has the potential to become broke or generic if we don't put our focus on God and His goodness.

I want to encourage you to use the day as an opportunity to meditate on His word and the direction it gives us to see God and all He is. **Our strength and shield, our helper, our refuge, our Savior and friend.**

And I know I'm going to be just as much as you are up to my ears and stuffing and mashed potatoes and guests and everything, but just go lock yourself in the bathroom for five minutes for heaven's sakes and be thankful or something. #### Psalm 28:6-7 Reflection

Listen to these words from Psalm 28 verses 6 and 7.

**Psalm 28:6-7 (ESV):**

> Blessed be the Lord for He has heard the voice of my pleas for mercy. The Lord is my strength and my shield in Him my heart trusts and I am helped and my heart exalts and with my song I give thanks to Him. These verses are a powerful reminder of all we have because Jesus loved us so much that He gave His life for us.

#### Gratitude for Gospel and Life's Impact

I encourage you to think of all the ways God provides for you and I trust that God's spirit will generate joy, praise, and thanksgiving that comes from focusing on His amazing love. Please join us as we give thanks for all God is doing and for all He's done through gospel and life this past year. We're so grateful for the encouragement we get from the messages we receive telling us how God is bringing people to trust God through you and through this ministry.

So it's not merely a throwaway kind of statement when I say we have so much to be thankful for this year. We really do. And I want to note just a few things our team here at gospel and life gives thanks for in 2025:

- For the more than 214,000 people who receive our quarterly journal and emails
- For the millions of people who've listened to our podcast around the world
- For the thousands of people who shared one of our resources with someone
- For the 284,000 downloads of the questioning Christianity podcast by people exploring or sharing the gospel

#### Closing: Thanksgiving and Partnership

On behalf of everyone here at gospel and life we also give thanks to God for you.

For your prayers, your gifts, and how you're missionally sharing our content with those in your life. Thank you for your partnership as together we endeavor to reach others with a message of Christ's love. **Thanks be to God.

He's changed everything through Christ.

#### 引言：感恩与神的供应 大家好，我是凯西·凯勒。每年到了感恩节，我们都会停下来，认识神在供应上有多么恩慈——既供应我们基本的物质需要，也在属灵上供应我们，使我们借着祂的儿子耶稣基督得着喜乐、盼望与更新。#### 专注于神的重要性 如果我们不把焦点放在神和祂的良善上，感恩节很容易变得空洞，或只是泛泛而谈。我想鼓励你把这一天当作一个机会，默想祂的话语，以及祂的话语所给我们的指引，使我们看见神是谁、祂有何等的属性。

**祂是我们的力量和盾牌，我们的帮助者，我们的避难所，我们的救主和朋友。** 我知道你我都会忙得不可开交——各种馅料、土豆泥、客人和事务。但看在老天的份上，就把自己锁进洗手间五分钟，然后感恩一下吧。#### 诗篇 28：6-7 的默想 请听诗篇第 28 篇第 6、7 节的话。

**诗篇 28：6-7（和合本）：** > 耶和华是应当称颂的，因为祂听了我恳求怜悯的声音。耶和华是我的力量，是我的盾牌；我心里倚靠祂，就得帮助；所以我心欢喜，我必用诗歌称谢祂。这些经文有力地提醒我们：我们所拥有的一切，是因为耶稣如此爱我们，甚至为我们舍了自己的生命。#### 为福音与生命的影响而感恩 我鼓励你思想神供应你的各种方式。

我相信当你把焦点放在祂奇妙的爱上时，神的灵会在你里面生发出喜乐、赞美与感恩。请与我们一同为神正在做的事献上感谢，也为祂在过去这一年里借着福音与生命所成就的一切献上感谢。我们非常感激收到的来信，这些信息告诉我们神如何借着你和这项事工带领人来信靠祂。所以当我说今年我们有那么多值得感恩的事时，这绝不是随口一说。

确实如此。我也想简单列举一些我们 Gospel in Life 团队在 2025 年特别感恩的事： - 超过 214，000 位订阅我们季刊与邮件的人 - 世界各地收听我们播客的数百万人 - 成千上万把我们的资源分享给他人的人 - 《质疑基督教》播客被下载 284，000 次——这些下载来自正在探索福音或分享福音的人 #### 结语：感恩与伙伴关系 我也代表 Gospel in Life 的每一位同工，为你向神献上感谢：感谢你的祷告、你的奉献，以及你如何带着宣教使命把我们的内容分享给你生命中的人。谢谢你与我们同工，共同努力，用基督之爱的讯息去触及更多人。**感谢神！

祂借着基督改变了一切。愿你度过一个充满喜乐的感恩节。
