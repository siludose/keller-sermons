## 爱的三个维度 / Three Dimensions of Love

That's the farest. Now, let's get to the first tree because we're going to do this for the rest of the spring, all the way to June. The first tree is relationships.

What we have here in this very famous passage that we just read, there's another version of it in Matthew 5, but it's a lot longer than the other place where we have the servant on the mount. There's a shorter version of it, and therefore, I pull it out because it fits the page, see? It's on the page.

Now, and Matthew 5 did not. Much of the other reasons. So relationships, that's the first subject.

Now, as soon as you hear the word relationships, right away you say, ah, relationships, you're thinking of friendship, or love and marriage and romance. And of course, everything in here absolutely applies, especially to marriage. Love your enemies.

Do good to those who curse you. Okay? In other words, and you know what, I can't even get back to this as funny as that is, as funny as that is, if this is the behavior that God demands, that we take with people who are hostile to us, it's obvious that he expects us to give it in our friendships and in our marriages.

We can't expect that God expects us to do less for people that we are close to than people in our neighborhood. However, the main purpose of this passage is not to talk about friendships and love relationships. The main purpose is to talk about our relationships to other people outside of our friendships as a matter of fact.

And therefore, if you look through here, you'll see Jesus right away starts off with three cases. He's talking about three kinds, three groups of people right away, and he tells us what behavior he expects. Now, let's look and see what he's calling for.

And then we'll immediately be shocked, upset, and then we'll have to say, okay, how can we do it? Now, the first thing, the first group of people is people who oppose you. People who are against you, people who have wronged you.

And that's why we see love your enemies, those who hate you, those who curse you, hating and curse you means they will you ill. And then those who mistreat you and those who struck you on the cheek, those are people who have done you ill. And Jesus says, I want you to love them, I want you to care for them, I want you to pray for them, I want you to pull for them.

And I want you to as much as possible be good to them. That's the first group. The second group are people not who have wronged you, but people less fortunate than you.

Now you see, if you read this, there's a tendency when it says, if someone takes your cloak, do you not stop them from taking your tunic? And there's a tendency to stick that sentence with what came before, in which case it looks like it's saying, when someone robs you, say, oh, by the way, here's my safe behind this picture. But what it's saying, because this sentence actually goes grammatically and logically with what comes after, give to everyone who asks you.

And if anyone takes what belongs, you don't demand it back to others as you would have them do to you. Now you see this dude others as you have to do to you. If we're talking about robbery here, that doesn't fit, does it?

It sounds like it's saying, well, when you're robbing somebody, how would you want to be treated? No, that's not what it's saying. It couldn't be saying that.

And rather, the word take and ask are synonyms, just like, you see, hate and curse and mistreat are synonyms. And what it's saying is, when someone comes, and they say, I'm in need, you're supposed to be promiscuously generous, Earl Ellis, who wrote a wonderful commentary, I'm going to quote him a couple times, wrote a great commentary on the book of Luke. This is what he says about this passage.

He says, this right here where it says, ask, anyone who asks of you give, not just your cook but your tunic. He says, Christ is not here advocating perfunctory or even large gifts to the poor. Get this.

He enjoins a moral concern that will express itself in a spirit of self-denial in every encounter of life. And that will do, and will do this for the sake of the kingdom of God. He says, a spirit of self-denial that is part of every encounter in life.

Now here's what that means. It means you are so concerned for people who have less than you. But you don't even go out and buy a chair without thinking about them.

You say, OK, I'm going to go buy a chair, but I've got to make sure I buy a chair in such a way that I have money to give away. I mean, it's going to affect everything, not just your outer coat, but your tunic. It's a way of saying that every single part of your life be oriented toward promiscuous generosity.

You're never not thinking about it. It's not enough to say, well, you know, every time somebody comes and takes an offering or somebody asks to give it to the office, I'm pretty generous. This is much, much more extensive than that.

So first of all, you have people who have wronged you. Secondly, you have people who have less than you, who have a more less fortunate you. But here's the last one.

It's more subtle. Thirdly, people who are indifferent and different. Now, if you look at the rest of this, it says, if you love those who love you, if you love those who can be good to you, if you love those who can repay you, now, what is he talking about?

And then he says, even sinners, now, here's what he's talking about. Think about it for a minute, especially when he gets to the bottom. He says, I want you to be kind to the ungrateful and the wicked, see that?

That's who's in that paragraph. Now, let me put it like this. Everybody's like this.

Let's say you're a member of a political party, whether you're conservative or liberal. Maybe if you're in the middle, this doesn't count because you don't consider yourself part of a party, a certain political outlook. But let's say you have a racial.

If you're Anglo, it doesn't mean you may be not in a dominant society where Anglo is your dominant. It may not be quite as conscious of your race. But if you are African-American or Latin, Latino, or Asian-American, you're more conscious of race, no matter who you are, there's a tendency to see another group of people.

Over there, and it's not your group. And at the very, very best, you don't respect them very much. And at the very, very worst, you think that they're the problem in society.

At the very best, you don't respect them. At the very worst, you think they're the problem in society. Now, you will probably think, but I know some of these people.

I'm friendly with them. Some of them are kind of friends with me. I see them at the office, or I see them at work, or they're that sort of thing.

Or I went to school with some of them. I know some of them, however, they are, basically, they're different. They're not like you.

And you actually think of them as sort of kind of strange in many ways, or even people that you really just don't respect. Now, you may be civil to them, but you don't do for them. You don't do good.

You don't lay yourself out. You don't open your heart home. You don't open your purse.

所以人际关系是第一个主题。一听到“人际关系”这个词，你马上就会想到友谊、爱情和婚姻。当然，这里的每一句话都完全适用于这些方面，特别是婚姻。爱你的敌人。

向咒骂你的人行善。换句话说，你知道吗？即使这听起来很有趣，如果上帝要求我们对那些对我们怀有敌意的人表现出这种行为，那么很明显，他期望我们在友谊和婚姻中也这样做。我们不能指望上帝期望我们对亲近的人做得比邻居少。

然而，这段经文的主要目的是谈论我们与朋友之外的其他人之间的关系，实际上就是谈论我们与其他人的关系。因此，如果你仔细看看这里的内容，你会发现耶稣一开始就提到了三个案例。他谈的是三种人、三类群体，并告诉我们对他期望的行为方式。现在，让我们来看看他要求我们做到什么。

接下来我们会立刻感到震惊和不安，然后不得不问自己：我们怎么能做到呢？#### 第一类：对待反对你的人——爱仇敌 首先，第一类人群是反对你的人。也就是那些与你为敌的人，那些伤害过你的人。所以耶稣说："你们要爱你们的仇敌，为那逼迫你们的人祷告。

"恨你、咒骂你意味着他们对你怀有恶意。还有那些欺侮你、打你右脸的人，这些人也都是对你不好的人。耶稣说，我希望你们去爱他们，关心他们，为他们祈祷，尽可能地善待他们。#### 第二类：对待比你不幸的人——无节制的慷慨 第一类是那些反对你的人。

第二类则是那些没有伤害过你但比你更不幸的人。现在你看，如果这里提到“有人拿走你的外衣，难道你不阻止他再拿走你的内衣吗？”这句话很容易让人联想到前面的内容，好像是在说，当别人抢劫你时，你可以这样说：顺便把我的保险箱也留下。但实际上，因为这个句子在语法和逻辑上与后面的内容相关，所以它的意思是“要向所有人施舍。

”还有，“有人强逼你们去拿什么，不要像他们要求你们归还的那样，强迫别人归还。” 如果这里说的是抢劫的话，这显然不符合文意。它听起来像是说：当别人抢劫你时，你会希望怎样被对待？不，这不是它的意思。

它不可能是这个意思。而且，这里的“问”和“拿”是同义词，就像恨、咒骂和虐待也是同义词一样。这段经文的意思是，当有人来告诉你他们有需要时，你应该慷慨大方。厄尔·埃利斯写了一本精彩的注释书《路加福音》，我将引用他的话几次。

他说： 这里说“问”，任何人向你求的都要给他，不只是你的仆人，连你的外衣也要给他。他说，基督并不是在提倡对穷人进行敷衍了事或甚至大额捐赠。请注意这一点。他呼吁一种道德上的关怀，这种关怀会在生活中每一次遭遇中表达为自我牺牲的精神。

这将为了神的国而做到这一点。他说，这是一种在生活中每一次遭遇都体现出来的自我牺牲精神。现在让我们来看看**这意味着什么。****这意味着你如此关心那些比你拥有的少的人。**

但你甚至在买椅子时也不忘他们。你说：“我要去买一把椅子了，但我必须确保以一种方式购买，这样我还能有余钱施舍。”也就是说，这会影响到生活的方方面面，不仅你的外衣，还包括你的内衣。这是一种说每一方面的生活都应导向无节制的慷慨。

你永远不能忘记这一点。仅仅在每次有人来收奉献或有人请求给予时表现得慷慨是不够的。这远比那更广泛。#### 第三类：对待冷漠和不同的人——超越社会圈子 首先，你要对待那些得罪过你的人。

其次，要对待那些比你幸运少的人。但这里还有一个最后一点。这是更为微妙的一点。第三，对待那些冷漠和不同的人都要友好。

现在，如果你看看剩下的部分，他说："你们若只爱那爱你们的，只爱人给你们好处的，只爱能报答你们的，那么他在说什么呢？" 然后他接着说：“甚至罪人。”想想看，尤其是当他说到这一点的时候。他说：“我希望你们对那些不感恩和邪恶的人也要仁慈。

” 那就是那一段里的人。现在，让我这样来说：每个人都是这样的。比如说你属于某个政治党派，无论是保守派还是自由派。也许如果你处于中间立场，这就不适用了，因为你觉得自己不属于任何党派或特定的政治观点。

但让我们说你是基于种族的。如果你是盎格鲁人，那并不意味着你在主导社会中就不是盎格鲁人的主导地位，你可能不太在意自己的种族。但是如果你是非洲裔美国人、拉丁美洲人、拉美裔或亚裔美国人，你会更在意自己的种族。无论你是谁，都有种看待另一群人的倾向。

他们不属于你的群体，在最好的情况下，你对他们也不怎么尊敬；在最糟糕的情况下，你认为他们是社会的问题。在最好的情况下，你对他们不尊敬；在最糟糕的情况下，你认为他们是社会的问题。现在，你可能会想：但我认识这些人。我跟他们关系不错。

有些人是某种程度的朋友，我在办公室见到他们，在工作中见到他们，或者他们就是那种人。或者我和他们一起上学过，我知道他们，然而，基本上，他们和你是不同的。他们不像你。实际上，你会觉得他们在很多方面都很奇怪，甚至是你根本不尊重的人。

现在，你可能对他们礼貌一些，但你不会为他们做什么好事。你不会敞开心扉，不会打开你的家门，也不会打开你的钱包。你不会敞开心扉，不会打开你的生活。你会和那些像你的人交往，你尊敬的人。

而耶稣来了，说：当然，每个人都是这样的。这就是他在这里的主要观点。绝对每个人都这样。他在跟人们说话，并且当他说“罪人”这个词时，你看到了这个词吗？

为什么用引号呢？为什么用引号呢？耶稣通常只在引号里使用这个词。这里的原因是：记得在路加福音15章中，法利赛人来的时候说：“他和罪人一同吃饭。

”他们所说的“罪人”，是指不敬虔、行为不端的人，妓女、税吏、罗马的合作者等等。耶稣并没有用这种说法。祂没有把世界分为罪人和好宗教人士。所以祂一定是针对那些这样使用这个词的人在说话。

祂对这些人说：表面上看，你们都说自己是宗教人士而他们不是，但事实上，你们所有人都是怎么做的呢？你们走进一个房间，环顾四周，会想：这些是我的同类吗？我愿意待在这里吗？我想和他们交往吗？

## 爱超越圈子 / Loving Beyond Your Circle

You don't open your heart. You don't open your life. You hang with the people who are like you.

The people you respect. And Jesus comes along and says, of course, everybody's like that. That's the gist of his point in here.

Absolutely, everybody's like that. He's talking to people. And when he uses the word sinners here, you see the word sinners?

Why is it in quotations? Why is it in quotes? Jesus never uses the word sinners, except in quotes, usually.

Here's why. Remember, like in Luke 15, when the Pharisees come and say, he eats with sinners. And see, they mean by sinners, irreligious, immoral people, prostitutes, tax collectors, Roman collaborators, stuff like that.

And Jesus doesn't use the word that way. He doesn't divide the world into sinners and the nice religious people. So it must mean he's talking to the kind of people who use the word like that.

And what he's saying to them is absolutely everybody on the surface, you say, I'm religious and they're not, but absolutely everybody does is what do they do? You walk into a room and you look around at the other people in the room and you say, are these my kind of people? Do I want to be here?

Do I want to associate with them? Do they make me feel more about myself like I want to feel? Now, Jesus is saying, everybody does it.

Now let's just say you're a worldly person. Well, what you're going to do is you're going to walk into the room and you're going to look around and you see people that look less cool, less savvy, less accomplished than you, people that, you know, you tried real hard to keep yourself in shape and dress nicely and these people look kind of like slabs and, you know, you'll put up with them for a while. You're not going to open up.

These people do not make you feel about yourself the way you want to feel. You go into these rooms and you say, are these the kind of people that will move me up socially to be accepted by the people that want to be accepted by and will these people move me up psychologically so that I feel about myself the way I want to feel about myself. And if these people aren't as cool as you think you might be at least, at least try to be, if they're not as, if they're not as acclaimed, if they're not as pulled together, if they're not as accomplished, if they're not as good looking, then you just find your way out of that room.

And here was, what Jesus is saying is, okay, but what about religious people? Are they different? No.

Religious people come on in and they look around and religious people need to feel that they're pretty good because all religious people deeply need the assurance that they're good. Why? Because they're basic, they're, they're whole identity on the idea, I'm a good person.

If I live a good enough life, if I obey the similar amount, if I do all the things right, then God will love me. But you never know you're good enough. So you desperately need assurance that you are.

So when you walk in, you look at people and you say, are these, are these my kind of people? Are these upright decent people? Are these people that will help me get accepted by the people I need to feel accepted by if I'm going to feel okay about myself?

Are these the kind of people that make me feel like I'm a decent person that I have the right ideas, that I have the right beliefs, that I have the right doctrines, that I have the right practices? Jesus says, you're all the same. And he says, however, therefore Jesus is not contrasting two ways, he's contrasting three ways.

He's saying, here's how sinners do it, here's how religious people do it, and Christians have to be different than both. He says, I know everybody respects civilly. I mean, they show respect to the people whose beliefs differ with theirs, people that they don't respect much, people who are other, but you're going to be different.

Jesus' Christians are going to give, they're going to do good, they're going to lend, they're going to open their hearts, they're going to open their lives, they're going to deliberately look for opportunities as much as possible to do for people who are very different from you, the kind of things that everybody else only does for their own kind. And therefore Jesus is saying, here's how you treat enemies, love and forgiveness. Here's how you treat people who are less fortunate than you, and here's how you treat people who are different and indifferent to you, the people that you consider ungrateful and wicked.

And Jesus says, that's how I want you to live. Now let's stop for one second. Most religions have a lot of ethics to go on these lines, but everybody agrees that at this point Jesus has broken through his burst the banks.

When he starts to say, love your enemies. When he starts to say, live lives of promiscuous generosity. And when he says, I want you to alone amongst the face of the earth, be people who are deliberately able to with love and without any disrespect, share and serve people who are utterly different than you.

In fact he goes this far, in a sense what he's doing in here is he's saying, the mark that you're a Christian, the thing that differentiates a Christian from people who are both religious and irreligious is their attitude toward people who are deeply different than they are. Do you act superior to them? Or the people who are come against you, do you pay them back, or do you forgive them and serve them without superiority?

Jesus, that's how we know that you belong to me. Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer, or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith? For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding of what it means to follow Christ.

A great resource to start using this summer is the new city catechism devotional, God's truth for our hearts and minds. This devotional brings the historic catechisms of the Christian Church to life, offering a question to consider for each week of the year. In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catechesis, the rich and communal practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers that frame the foundational beliefs of the Christian faith.

Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer, and a brief meditation that will challenge and inspire you. The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller, and Kevin D. Young, as well as historical figures such as Augustine, John Calvin, and Martin Luther.

This month, in addition to the new city catechism devotional, we are including a great companion resource, the new city catechism for kids, as our thank you for your gift to help gospel and life share the hope of Christ's love with people all over the world. So request your copies today at gospelonlife.com slash give. That's gospelonlife.com slash give.

Now here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. I'll write away people say, first of all, A, I can't do it, and B, if I did, I think it sounds like suicide, right? People say it's impossible for me inside, and even if it was possible, it seems like, you know, it would be suicidal.

Well, listen briefly, but there's an awful lot of stuff packed into this passage. Briefly, there's three things that Jesus says, almost as if he knows people are going to say that. He says, let me tell you what the difficulty is, and let me tell you what inner dynamic you need to have, and then let me give you some directions, difference, difficulty, dynamic and directions, and here's what they are.

First of all, he says, here's what the basic, basic difficulty is. Three times, he says, if you love only those who love you, what credit is that, or he says, if you love, if you only do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that? And then three times, he says, what credit is that?

Now, that's a hard thing to, if you read that, it's kind of vague. It's a little ambiguous. What does it mean?

What credit is that? Credit with who? And the NIV, the translation we have there, is trying to be ambiguous, and it ought to be ambiguous, because it's a very, very interesting and pregnant and multi, I think basically, multi-dimensional thing.

Jesus is actually saying, literally, I'll tell you what he's saying. He says, if you love those who love you, and he says, what grace? This is there in that.

Because the word that's translated credit is the New Testament word for grace, caress. It's the New Testament word that means unmerited love. And when he says, if you only love those who love you, where's the unmerited love in that?

他们会让我感觉更好吗？现在耶稣说，每个人都会这样想。假设你是一个世俗的人。那么当你走进一个房间时，你会看到一些看起来不如你酷、不够精明、不够成功的人。

你知道自己努力保持身材整洁，而这些人却显得有些邋遢。你会勉强忍受他们一段时间，但不会敞开心扉。这些人都不能让你感觉更好。你进入这些房间会想：这些人能让我在社交上更受欢迎吗？

他们会让我心理上感觉更好吗？如果这些人不够酷，或者不够成功，那么你就找个借口离开那个房间。耶稣说的就是这个意思：但是宗教人士呢？他们是不是不同？

不是的。宗教人士进来后，环顾四周，他们需要觉得自己不错。为什么呢？因为他们的基本身份认同就是“我是一个好人”。

如果我过着足够好的生活，遵守同样的规则，做好所有该做的事情，上帝就会爱我。但你永远不知道自己是否足够好。所以你需要确信自己的价值。当你走进来时，你会观察周围的人，问：“这些人是我的同类吗？

他们是正直、体面的人吗？他们能帮助我获得那些我需要认同感的人的认可吗？这样我才能对自己感到满意吗？”耶稣说：“你们都是一样的。

”但他说这话并不是在对比两种方式，而是三种。他指出，罪人是这么做的，宗教人士是这么做的，基督徒必须与两者不同。他说，我知道大家都会彼此尊敬，即使是对那些信仰不同的、不太尊重的人也是如此。但是你们要与众不同。

耶稣的信徒会给予帮助，他们会施舍，他们的心灵和生活会敞开心扉，尽可能多地寻找机会去为与自己截然不同的人做好事——这是其他人只会对同类人做的事情。因此，耶稣说：“对待敌人，要以爱和宽恕；对待比你更不幸运的人，要给予关怀；对待那些对你漠不关心甚至视为不值得感激或邪恶的人，也要同样对待。” 耶稣说，这就是我希望你们这样生活。现在让我们暂停一下。

大多数宗教都有类似的道德规范，但所有人都同意，在这一点上，耶稣已经突破了界限。当他开始说要爱仇敌时；当他开始提倡无节制的慷慨时；当他宣称要在地球上成为与众不同的人——能够怀着爱心、不带任何轻蔑地与完全不同的人分享和服侍他们。实际上他走得更远，在某种意义上，他在做的事情就是：基督徒之所以是基督徒，区别于那些既虔诚又不信的人，就在于你们对那些与自己截然不同的人的态度。你会对他们表现出优越感吗？

还是说，当人们反对你时，你会报复他们，还是会宽恕并服侍他们而不带任何优越感？耶稣，这就是我们如何知道你是属于我的标志。### 如何做到：三个关键要素 这个夏天你在寻找增长信仰的方式吗？还是希望帮助新信徒或孩子理解基督教的核心教义？

对于很多人来说，夏季可以提供更多的机会来加深我们的信仰和对跟随基督的理解。一个很好的资源是今年的新城市 catechism 日课，《神在我们心中的真理》。这本日课将基督教历史上经典的 catechisms 带入生活，为一年中的每一天提供一个问题供你思考。在引言中，提摩西·凯勒阐述了 catechesis 的重要性——这一丰富而社群性的学习和记忆问答的过程，它构成了基督教信仰的基础信念。

每周包括一段圣经经文、一个祷告和一篇简短的沉思，这些内容将挑战并激励你。附带的注释由当代牧师如约翰·派博、提摩西·凯勒和凯文·D·杨以及历史人物如奥古斯丁、约翰·加尔文和马丁·路德撰写。这个月，除了新的城市 catechism 祷读之外，我们还将提供一个新的配套资源——适合儿童的新城市 catechism，作为您捐赠的感谢。这将帮助福音和生命向全世界的人们分享基督之爱的信息。

请在 gospelonlife.com/give 下单订购您的副本。#### 一、困难所在：缺乏真正无条件的爱 现在，请听蒂姆·凯勒继续今天的教导。有人可能会说："首先，A、我做不到；B、即使做到了，我也觉得那就像自杀一样。"人们认为，在内心深处，这几乎是不可能的，而且即便有可能，也似乎像是自杀。

但是，请稍作聆听，这段经文里包含了很多内容。简而言之，耶稣说了三件事，仿佛他预知人们会这么说。他说：“让我告诉你困难在哪里，你需要怎样的内在动态，以及你应该采取的方向。”困难、内在动态和方向，具体来说是： 首先，他说，最基本的困难是什么。

他三次说：“如果你只爱那些爱你的人，那有什么值得称赞的呢？”或者“如果你只对那些对你好的人做好事，那又有什么值得称道的地方呢？”然后他又说了三次。读到这里，你可能会觉得有些模糊和含糊不清。

这到底意味着什么？“那有什么值得称赞的？”称赞的对象是谁？NIV 翻译版本试图保持这种模糊性，因为这是一个非常有趣、充满寓意且多维的问题。

耶稣实际上说的是：“如果你只爱那些爱你的人，那么其中的恩典在哪里呢？”这里的“恩典”是新约圣经中表示不配得之爱的词，“caress”，意为无条件的爱。如果只爱那些爱你的人，那里的无条件之爱又在哪里呢？好吧，这确实有点奇怪，但他想表达的是：首先，当你只爱那些给你带来某种情感回报或社会回报的人时——他们帮助你社交上或者自尊心上，你需要小心。

想想这个。宗教人士看起来像是在与需要帮助的人一起工作，他们在与那些让人感到疲惫的人一起工作，但为什么呢？你为什么要这样做？难道不是因为你想要说：“我知道上帝爱我。

”因为看看我是怎样的人。在这种情况下，耶稣说，当你只为了某种回报而爱人时，并不是你不够爱，而是你没有全心全意地去爱。耶稣说，不要拿我的标准来衡量自己，说我爱别人，但并不是像那样爱。耶稣说，如果你是因为对方能给你带来利益才去爱他们，那你根本就没有真正去爱他们，你只是在爱那些对你有益的东西，你在利用他们来满足自己的虚荣心。

你不是为了他们的缘故而爱人，而是为了你的缘故。你没有全心全意地去爱，这里根本没有**真正的爱。这里有A人和B人，A人很酷，B人则有点让人感到疲惫，你会更爱前者，为什么？这与他们无关，只与你自己有关，这不是**关于他们的。

天哪，你可能会被某个人吸引，对某个人有好感，但这并不是因为那个人本身。而是因为你认为如果这个人喜欢自己，那说明自己是个重要的人。耶稣说，在这里根本没有任何**真正的爱，因为你所做的只是**基于对方对你自尊心的满足来爱人。> 所以首先，他说你们的爱不是真正的爱。

其次，这里就是你无法满足的原因。如果你只爱那些爱你的人，那么你的爱在哪里呢？他所说的只是这个意思。想象一下一个投资银行家，你们中有些人就是这样的，好吧，我们现在假设你是赚得盆满钵满的那种人，而不仅仅是说你很富有，你是一个投资者，我们不说你是投资银行家，你就是一个投资者，而且是赚得盆满钵满的那种。

## 彻底的接纳 / Radical Inclusion

Well, now that's a little weird, but here's what he's saying. Number one, he's saying, when you love your own kind, and not others, when you love people who are giving you some kind of emotional payoff or some kind of social payoff, that they're helping you socially, or they're helping you in your self-esteem, whenever you, you know, I mean, you've got to be careful. Think about this.

Religious people look like they're kind of working with draining people, and they're working with needy people, you know, they look like it very often, but why? Why are you doing it? Are you not doing it so that you can say, I know God loves me, because look at the kind of person I am.

In that case, you see, Jesus is saying, when you only love people for a payoff, it's not really that you don't love well enough, you're not loving it all. Jesus is saying, don't look at my standard and say, well, I love people, but not like that. Jesus says, if you love people because of what they profit you, you're not loving them at all, you're loving what they give you, you're loving your own ego, and you're using them to fulfill it.

You're not loving them for their sakes. You're loving them for your sake. You're not loving it all.

There's no loving at all. Here's Person A, and here's Person B, and Person A is cool, and Person B is a slob and kind of draining, and you love this one, much more than you love that one, why? You know, it has nothing to do with them, has everything to do with you, it's not about them.

My goodness, you can be attracted, you can have a crush on this person, and it's not about them. It's about you, boy, the person who looks like this, and of a person who is this kind of position in society, and of a person who's got looks like this, if they like me back, then I'll know I'm somebody. And Jesus is saying, there's no love here at all, because what you're doing is you're loving on the basis of their merits with regard to your self-esteem.

So first of all he's saying, your love isn't love, but then secondly he's saying, and here's the reason you are indeficent. If you only love those who love you, where's the love in you, and what he means is simply this. Think of an investment banker, you know, some of you are, all right, now let's just say you are just rolling at it, not just saying, you know, and you're personally wealthy, and you're just absolutely rolling at it, you're an investor, let's not say you're an investment banker, you're an investor, and you're just rolling at it, and you know, you have a number of opportunities that come before you.

If you're just rolling at it, you know what? You can look at a product and say, I like this new business, I'll capitalize it, why? Because I like the product, because I think it's good for people, because I like the attitude of the entrepreneur, right?

Even though I don't know if it's going to work, but I like that, so I'm going to do it. Okay, but what if you're an investor sucking air? What if you're an investor in a lot of trouble?

What if you're an investor saying, man, I've got to make a major profit on the next investment, then I'm sorry, you're only going to put your money, not whether it's a good product, not whether you like the entrepreneur, you've got to put it wherever you're going to get a payoff. Now, Jesus Christ is saying, everybody on the face of the earth is an investor sucking air when it comes to love. You are not sure about who you are, you are not sure of yourself, that's the reason why you make such distinctions in who you love and who you go out with.

And I would say, I'm talking about friendship, man, I'm talking about romance, but I'm also just talking about who you associate with, who you sit down with, who you spend time with, how much time and how much heart you put into a conversation on the street is all going to have to do, Jesus says, with what's happening in your heart. And he says, because you're in deficit, you're not loving it all, you're investing in anybody that can give you the payoff you need. And that's the problem, because that inner love deficit, that inner grace deficit, you're going to have to experience unmerited love, you're going to have to experience an ocean of unmerited love, if you're going to be able to give it.

So that's the difficulty. So what's the dynamic? The dynamic is right here at the very end, now take a quick close look.

First of all, and I'm going to read you what Earl Ellis says, first of all, Jesus says, then your reward would be great and you'll be sons of the most high because he is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked. If you can get ahold of that verse, if you believe it, you know it, you understand it, you're taking the center of your life, you'll have the dynamic that will enable you to begin to move out and do what Jesus Christ is saying. You'll want to do it, you'll actually be able to take steps.

If you don't believe that verse, if you don't understand what's in it, then everything Jesus calls you to is at best impossible and at worst dangerous rubbish. But what if you understand what's in there or what's in there, two things? First of all, excuse me, it she knows, okay?

Please go away. The first thing it says is your sons of the father. Earl Ellis in his commentary on Luke says, you have to be very careful because it looks the way the English translation comes out, doesn't it?

It looks like if I give love, then I'll become a son of God, right? It says, then you will be. It sounds like, then you will become, but that's not what the Greek sense is at all.

This is what he says. He says, this is spoken to disciples for whom God is already your father. What Jesus is doing here is inviting his disciples to actualize in their ethic the meaning of their relationship.

They are called to be what you are. Now what this means is a Christian has to understand that I'm adopted. What is adoption?

Now John chapter 1 verse 12, Paul and Galatians 4 says, even though everybody is a creation of God and therefore loved and valued by God, it is an act of grace when we are adopted. Now to be adopted means something very important and in those days, if an heir was, let's just say, a wealthy person, a wealthy man or woman had no children, what was very normal for them to do is they would take some other adult and they would adopt them and then that person would become their heir and what would happen at the moment of adoption and that's the background to everything the New Testament understands about our relationship with God. Adoption, first of all, it's a legal grace because you might be penniless, but the second that the seal is put on your adoption papers suddenly, even though you haven't done anything to work for it, suddenly, automatically, you're rich.

By grace, legally, by standing in an instant, but the second thing is you don't just have this wealth. You have a new intimacy, suddenly this great person is no longer your CEO, no longer your prime minister, this person is your father and that means you have intimacy with him, it means your relationship is permanent, a father's love for a child gets stronger when it does wrong. You also have accessibility, don't call the CEO or don't call the prime minister up at 2 a.m.

to ask for a glass of water, that won't be considered right, but a son or a daughter can ask. And so suddenly, now that is assumed here, do you understand that relationship? Do you understand that the Lord of heaven and earth is your father that you've been adopted by grace?

In spite of everything you are, you're rich in him, you're loved permanently, you are loved unconditionally, you are loved comprehensively, that's an assumption. I can't go into all that now, I'm not going to go into all that now, this passage doesn't explain adoption, it assumes it and you have to understand that that's the first point. The first thing you have to understand to get that dynamic is are you adopted, do you understand what that means?

Is that the greatest thing about you? Is that really the source of everything? But then secondly, it says for he is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked.

Now you see, the ungrateful and the wicked is a parallel with everything that's been going up. In other words, Jesus is saying here, I want you to be like your father because he has been gracious to his enemies, he's been gracious to his enemies, and who are those enemies? Wow, us, and this is the dynamite, and I tell you, if you can light this dynamite, you can light the fuse on this and here's how you do it, a Christian understands him or herself to be an adopted enemy, an adopted enemy, two things, on the one hand you were an enemy, now neither religious nor irreligious people believe their enemies of God, and I don't have the time and this isn't the place, because this passage doesn't go into it.

For me to explain all of how that operates, but here's the way, religious people never think of themselves as enemies of God, they say I'm trying so hard, I'm trying very hard to be like God, I'm trying to do it all, and irreligious people say, well I'm indifferent or I have trouble believing, but they don't consider themselves enemies of God, and one of the ways you know that you're a Christian, that the basis for your relationship with God is on grace, and not by your performance and your achievement and your good works, is that you've come to understand that you are an enemy, that means that you have just you have resented his claim on your every centimeter of your life, and you have even come to see that even your efforts to be good have really been ways of trying to get control of a God and get him to have to do things for you, and a Christian is somebody who says I'm an enemy, but I'm adopted, and when you put those two things together, everything that's in here flows out, why, where do you see, where do you say, well that's interesting conceptually, all right, you have to melt your heart with it, where do you see God really being kind of the ungrateful and the wicked on the cross, because on the cross you see him cursed, but he's blessing, on the cross you see him mistreated, but he's praying, just like Jesus is not saying, Jesus is not just simply saying, be like this, and he's not just simply saying, be like this because I'm like this, he's saying, be like this because I am going to be like this for you, and when that happens, when you see that, in other words, when you see him loving you, and let me ask you a question, what did loving you do for Jesus' social standing? Jesus didn't just get nothing out of you, he went infinitely down, he came from heaven to earth, as the song goes, he came from earth to the grave. He went all the way down, let me ask another question, what did Jesus Christ get out of you, not socially, but psychologically, what did he do for his self-esteem?

He made him to be sin who knew no sin. Look, here is Jesus Christ who looks at you and loves you for you, not only did he get nothing out of you, he got exactly the opposite of what you seek to get out of your relationships, unless you see that on the one hand, you were so lost, he had to die for you, on the other hand, you were so loved that he had to die for you. And when you take that in and you see him doing that, you will have finally the answer to the love deficit, the unmerited love deficit, and you will look out there and you'll see people and you'll say no matter how broken they are, I was broken, no matter how mistaken they are, look at all their wrong views, I was mistaken.

Even though they're even other hostile to you, I was hostile to him while he was doing it. I was upset as he was reaching out to me, we were jeering Adam in a sense, humankind was jeering Adam while he was dying for us, and you'll never be the same again when that gets all your heart. And then what happens is here's the directions, then what difference does that actually make?

Two things. First of all, turn the other cheek, and then forgive. Or you say turn the other cheek, that's the problem, that seems very, very impractical, oh really, now think about it for a second.

First of all, look at verse 27-28, these are very famous places. Love your enemy, pray for those, pull for them, turn the other cheek. Well, it sounds like it's saying, you just walk all over me, that's all right, hit me again, I'm still breathing.

Listen, first of all, look at the word butt. What's the word butt, therefore? It's a contrast.

Well, what came before it? Well, we read it three weeks ago, Jesus Christ in the beginning of Luke, this is the Luke version. Jesus Christ says, blessed of the poor, blessed of those who grieve, blessed of those who rejected, woe to the rich, woe to those who are in power.

如果你赚得盆满钵满，那么你可以看看一个产品就说：“我喜欢这个新业务，我要投资它。”为什么呢？因为你喜欢这个产品，因为它对人们有好处，因为你觉得创业者的态度很好，对吧？即使你不确定它是否会成功，但你喜欢它，所以你要做这件事。

但是如果你是一个在苦苦挣扎的投资人呢？如果你是一个处境困难的投资者呢？如果你是一个说：“天哪，我必须在下一个投资上赚大钱才行。”那么对不起，你只会把钱投到能给你回报的地方。

现在，耶稣基督说的是：当涉及到爱的时候，地球上的每一个人都像是一个在苦苦挣扎的投资人。你们对自己都不确定，这就是你们为什么会区分出谁值得爱、谁不值得爱的原因。而且我要说，我谈论的是友谊，是爱情，但归根结底，我只是在谈论你与谁交往，你和谁坐在一起，你和谁共度时光。你在街上和人交谈时投入了多少时间和真心，这一切都将取决于你内心发生了什么。

耶稣说："因为你们的心里有亏损，不爱人如己，只投资那些能给你所需回报的人。"这就是问题所在，因为你内心的爱亏欠，你内心的恩典亏欠，你必须经历无条件的爱，必须体验一片无尽的无条件之爱，才能给予出去。#### 二、内在动力：我是被领养的敌人 所以这就是困难。那么动态是什么呢？

这个动态就在最后。请快速看一下。首先，我先读给你听，首先是耶稣说："你们的赏赐就大了，你们便是天父的儿子。"因为他是善待那不感谢他的人和恶人。

如果你能抓住这节经文，相信它，理解它，把它放在生命中心，你就能拥有那种动态，使你能开始去做耶稣基督所要求的事情。你会想要这样做，并且能够迈出步伐。如果你不相信这节经文，或者不明白它的意思，那么耶稣对你的一切呼召要么是不可能的，要么是危险的废话。但假设你知道或理解了其中的内容呢？

有两件事。首先，请原谅我，她知道这一点，好的？请离开一下。第一点是你们是天父的儿子。

在路加福音的注释中，厄尔·埃利斯说，你必须非常小心，因为英语翻译看起来是不是这样？它似乎是在说，如果我给予爱，我就成了上帝的儿子，对吧？经文上写着“你们便成为”，听起来像是“你们就成为”，但这并不是希腊语的意思。他说的是，这是对那些已经把上帝当作父亲的门徒们所说的。

耶稣在这里邀请他的门徒在行为中实现他们与天父的关系的意义。他们被呼召成为你们现在的样子。**这意味着基督徒必须明白，我是领养的。**什么是领养？

约翰一书1章12节和加拉太书4章说，虽然每个人都是上帝所造，并因此被上帝爱和珍视，但当我们被领养时，这是上帝赐予的一种恩典。现在，领养意味着非常重要的一件事，在那些日子里，如果一个继承人，比如说一位富有的男性或女性没有孩子，他们通常会收养其他成年人作为自己的继承人。在那一刻，一旦封印了领养文件，即使你还没有为此付出努力，突然之间，你就变得富有起来。这是一种法律上的恩典，因为你可能一无所有，但一旦你的领养手续完成，即便你什么都没有做，你立刻就拥有了财富。

通过恩典和法律，瞬间之间，但第二点是，你不仅仅拥有这笔财富。你还获得了新的亲密关系。突然间，这位伟大的人不再是你的CEO或总理，而是你的父亲，**这意味着你与他有亲密的关系，意味着这种关系是永久的，父爱在孩子犯错时会变得更强。**你也有了可接近性，在半夜两点打电话给CEO或总理要一杯水是不合适的，但作为儿子或女儿可以这样做。

这里假设了这一点，你们明白这段关系吗？你们是否理解天上的主和地上的主宰是你的父亲，你是通过恩典被领养的？无论你是什么样的人，你在祂里面是富足的，在祂里面是永久被爱的，是无条件被爱的，是全面被爱的。这是前提。

我现在不打算详细解释这一切，这段经文没有解释领养的意义，而是假设了这一点，并且你们需要理解这一点。首先，你需要明白的是你是否已经被领养，你知道这意味着什么吗？这是你最大的特点吗？这就是一切的来源吗？

但接下来，经文说：“因为他待恶人也是慈爱的。” 你看，这里的“恶人”与前面提到的一切形成了对比。换句话说，耶稣在这里说，我希望你们像我的父亲一样，因为他的确对敌人也施予了恩典，对敌人施予了恩典。那些敌人是谁？

哇，就是我们！这真是震撼人心的一点，我要告诉你，如果你能点燃这个炸药，就能点燃这段经文的导火索，这里是如何做到的：一个基督徒会认为自己是被接纳的敌人，被接纳的敌人，有两点需要注意，一方面你曾经是敌对的，无论是宗教徒还是非宗教徒都不相信他们是上帝的敌人，而我没有时间在这里详细展开，因为这一段经文并没有深入探讨。为了详细解释这一切是如何运作的，让我先说一下：宗教人士从不认为自己是上帝的敌人，他们总是说：“我尽力了，我在努力成为像上帝一样的人，我在做所有这些事情。”而不信教的人可能会说：“我不关心，或者我对这个有疑问”，但他们也不会把自己视为上帝的敌人。

而一个知道他是基督徒的人——他的与上帝的关系建立在恩典上，而不是基于自己的表现、成就和善行——会认识到自己是敌对者。**这意味着他反感上帝对他生活的每一寸要求，并且甚至开始意识到，即使是试图做好事的努力也只是想控制上帝并让他为你做事的一种方式。**一个基督徒会说："我是敌人，但被收养了。"当你把这两件事放在一起时，这里的一切都会随之而来。

为什么呢？你在哪里看到这个概念有趣的地方，然后又说"好吧，我得让我的心融化"。在十字架上，你会看到上帝是如何对待那些不感恩和邪恶的人的，因为在十字架上，他被咒诅了，但他在祝福；他被虐待了，但他却在祈祷。耶稣不只是简单地说："效仿我。

"他也并不是因为自己就是这样才说"效仿我"，而是说："效仿我，因为我将为你这样做。"当你看到这一点时——换句话说，当你看到他爱你的时候——让我问你一个问题：爱你是如何影响耶稣的社会地位的？耶稣从你这里什么也没有得到。他不仅没有提升自己的社会地位，反而从天堂来到地球，正如那首歌所说，"从地球到坟墓"。

他一路走低。再问一个：耶稣基督从你那里得到了什么——不是从社会角度，而是从心理层面来说，他是如何提高自尊的？他本是无罪的，却代替我们成了罪。看哪，这就是耶稣基督，他看着你、爱你，不仅没有从你这里得到什么，反而得到了你所寻求在关系中得不到的东西，除非你能明白：一方面，你如此迷失，以至于他不得不为你而死；另一方面，你如此被爱，以至于他不得不为你而死。

当你理解这一点，并看到他的行为时，你就真正找到了那份未加代价的爱的答案。你会看到人们，无论他们多么破碎、错误百出，你曾是那样的人。即使有些人对你充满敌意，你也曾对他充满敌意，当他在向你伸出援手时。我们嘲笑亚当，人类也在他为我们而死的时候嘲笑他。

当你的心完全接受这一切时，你就再也不会是同一个人了。#### 三、方向指引：转过身去饶恕 然后接下来的问题是：这会带来什么不同？有两点。首先，转过身去，饶恕别人。

或者你会说，转过身去，这似乎很不实际。真的吗？请稍作思考。首先，看看27-28节的内容，这是非常著名的经文。

爱人如仇敌，为恨你的人祈祷，向他们施怜悯，转过身去。听起来好像在说：任凭别人践踏我吧，没关系，再打我一拳我也还活着。听我说，首先，看看“因此”这个词。“因此”的意思是什么？

## 爱要求公义 / Love Demands Justice

Well, remember that? Jesus is calling for justice. Jesus saying, we have to oppose injustice, we've got to go against injustice, but you must turn the other cheek.

Well, wait a minute, you say, how can you say we have to oppose injustice, but then we have to turn the other cheek? Think of what this means. First of all, why do you strike somebody on the cheek, to knock them out?

To rob them? No, no, no, no, you don't have to be a martial arts expert. You go for the job, if you're trying to knock them out, you go for the solar plexus, you go for the feet.

Why do you slap somebody on the cheek to insult them? And why do you turn the cheek? Now, even in our society, women do this in a way that men tend to not, but we still do it.

Whenever I go to see my sister, whenever I go to see my sister-in-laws, if ever I'm going, you know, and my family's coming to see their family, they come on out and what do they say? You know, my sister goes like this. Hi, what's she doing?

She wants to be kissed. She was greeting me and she wants me to greet her. Now, here's what Jesus is saying.

He's saying, I want you to oppose injustice, but I want you to do it without any, without any inner touchiness about your ego, without, you've been insulted, so what? He says, I want you to oppose injustice, but you don't go out to slap them back. You don't go out, you oppose injustice for the sake of justice.

You oppose injustice out of love for the person, the perpetrator, it's never loving to let somebody do injustice and sin. And you oppose injustice for the sake of the people around. You oppose injustice for it's sake, for the person's sake, for everybody else's sake, you never do it.

Just simply to say, I'm going to make that person feel bad, I'm going to make that person know they were wrong. I'm going to, in other words, Jesus said, not this slapping stuff. This is exactly the opposite of how you and I do it, because Jesus says, I want you to directly, courageously openly say, what you did was wrong, but inside you've forgiven them.

Why? Because you have the emotional humility, because you are an enemy, but you have the emotional wealth, because you're adopted, that you don't have anything to prove, because you know you are a sinner. You see, you have the emotional humility, you know you're a sinner, but you have the emotional wealth, because hey, look what I've got in Jesus.

Whatever they took from me, you know, my reputation, whatever this person did to me, it's not the most important thing to me. You know, Jesus is the most important thing. And therefore, because you have an inner forgiveness and you have, your pride's not all hurt on the inside, you walk out and you oppose that person with poise, you know, without a lot of rancor, without a lot of vengeance and venom at all, okay?

So you speak out, but inside you're at peace, but that's not how we do it, you know it happens when someone wrongs us, we say nothing, we say I don't want to rock the boat, but inside we're burning up with her pride. And Jesus says, I call you to be the opposite, the opposite. And you can.

Look, practical ramifications are so many. We're a church, right? Why is it in this community?

To some degree, people who don't have the best jobs and they don't have the best bodies may very often feel just as, just as sort of shunned as people as they feel out in the rest of the world that has to stop. Yeah. Secondly, a lot of you need to start telling the truth to people who have hurt you after you've worked on your own heart and forgiveness.

Then you go to them for their sake. Do you realize that the only way to beat injustice is not to be bitter? Because if you're bitter against what people have done to you, then they have turned you into what they are, but they're controlling you.

The only way to really beat injustice is to utterly forgive it and then oppose it with a certain amount of joy. Some of you got people you're going to have to talk to. And lastly, Jesus was the good Samaritan.

He was the true good neighbor. Why did I call this love in the neighborhood? I'll tell you why because when you say love by neighbor, it's so vague and pie.

Somebody thinks about, what does that mean? I'll tell you what it means. Your neighbor, Jesus says, is anybody that you share God's green earth with.

So if you're a Christian, look around your neighborhood. Do you ignore them and just go after the Christians? Do you know your neighbors?

Anybody there, Jesus Christ says, you need to treat as if they were me. Find them. Look for deliberate reasons to be for the common good of your neighborhood.

Because Jesus Christ, when he gave the good Samaritan parable, he was saying, I'll tell you who your neighbor is. He says, a Jew was in the road and along comes the Samaritan. The Jew was bleeding member and he's in the road and along comes the Samaritan and they hated each other.

Jesus Christ might have just as well said, a Ku Klux Klan wizard was bleeding and lying in the road and an African-American came along. He could have said a Serb was lying in the road and a Kosovoire came along. He could have said a Nazi was laying in the road, bleeding and dying, and along a Jew came along.

He's trying to say absolutely anybody in your road is now your neighbor because you were anybody to me. Look what I did. You talk about resources for social justice.

You talk about resources for bringing down barriers. Nothing will do what this can do, but if you want to be a neighbor, first you need a neighbor. You need to see that Jesus Christ was the one who comes along as in that parable and you were laying on the road and what did he do?

What's the parable say? He got down and he puts you up where he was. He puts you on his steed and he goes down on the ground and that's what Jesus did.

You were lying in the road. He puts you and gives you his status. He gives you his standing.

He gives you his righteousness. He gives you his place and he took our place until you are amazed with the mercy he gave. You will never be empowered to provide the mercy he requires.

Let's pray. We thank you, Lord, for this kind of resource. This is dynamite.

This is like a fuse. All we have to do is light it. But now help us to light it.

这是一个对比。那么之前说了什么？我们三周前读过这段经文，在路加福音的开头，这是路加版本。耶稣说：“贫穷的人有福了，哀恸的人有福了，受逼迫的人有福了。

”接着又说：“富足的人有祸了，有权柄的人有祸了。” 你还记得吗？耶稣在呼吁正义。他说我们必须反对不公义，必须与不公义作斗争，但你必须转过身去。

好吧，你暂停一下，说我们反对不公义，但还要转过另一边的脸去？想想这代表什么。首先，为什么你要打某人的脸颊来把他击倒？是为了抢劫吗？

不，不，不，不，你不需要是武术高手。如果你要击倒对方，你应该攻击他们的太阳穴或脚。为什么要用巴掌拍别人的脸颊来侮辱他们呢？而为什么要转过另一边的脸去？

即使在我们的社会里，女性这样做比男性多一些，但我们仍然会这样做。每次我去见我的妹妹，或者去看我的妹夫的家人时，如果我家人来看望他们的家人，他们会出来问候。你知道吗，我的妹妹会这样打招呼：“嗨，你怎么样？”她想要被亲一下。

她在和我打招呼的时候希望我也能回礼。耶稣在这里说的正是这个意思。他说，我要你们反对不公义，但不要带着任何对自我尊严的敏感，不要因为受了侮辱就怎么样怎么样。他要你们反对不公义，但不是用同样的方式去反击他们。

你反对不公义是为了正义，而不是为了报复。你要出于爱来反对不公义，对于施暴者本人也是如此，让别人做不公正的事是不爱的表现。你也反对不公义是为了周围的人，为了那个人本身，为了所有人，而不是仅仅为了让对方感到不好受，让他们知道他们错了。换句话说，耶稣说的不是这种拍巴掌的行为。

这恰恰与我们平时的做法相反，因为耶稣说，我要你们勇敢地、公开地说出：“你做错了。”但内心已经原谅了他们。为什么？因为你有情感上的谦卑，因为你是一个敌人，但你有情感上的财富，因为你被收养了，所以你没有什么可证明的，因为你知道自己是个罪人。

你看，你有情感上的谦卑，知道自己是罪人，但你有情感上的财富，因为嘿，看看我在耶稣里得到了什么。无论他们从我这里夺走了什么——我的名誉，或者这个人对我做了什么，对我来说都不是最重要的。你知道，耶稣才是最重要的。因此，因为你内心充满了宽恕，你的骄傲没有受到伤害，所以你可以从容地面对那个人，没有太多的怨恨、报复和恶意。

你可以说出来，但内心是平静的，但这不是我们通常的做法。你知道，当有人冒犯我们时，我们往往选择沉默，不想打破现状，但在心里却燃烧着愤怒。耶稣说，我要你们做相反的事——恰恰相反，并且你们能做到。### 实际应用 #### 在教会中活出这样的爱 看看实际的影响有多少。

我们是一个教会，对吧？为什么在这个社区里？在某种程度上，那些没有最好的工作和身体状况的人可能会感觉自己就像被排斥一样，就像外面世界中被迫停止的人一样。其次，很多你们需要开始向伤害过你的人坦诚相待，在自己内心原谅之后再去面对他们。

这样做是为了他们的缘故。你知道，战胜不公的唯一方法不是怀恨在心吗？因为如果你对别人对你所做的事感到愤怒，那么你就被他们变成了和他们一样的人，他们在控制着你。真正战胜不公的方法是彻底地宽恕，并且以某种喜悦的心情去反对它。

有些你们需要去面对的人。#### 耶稣是**真正的好邻舍 最后，耶稣就是**那个好撒玛利亚人，他是**真正的良邻。我为什么把这称为"邻里之爱"呢？告诉你原因是**因为当你说到"爱人如己"的时候，这个词听起来太模糊、太抽象了。

有人在想，这到底是什么意思？让我告诉你**这意味着什么。**耶稣说，你的邻居是与你共享上帝绿色地球的任何人。所以如果你是一个基督徒，看看你的社区。

你会忽视他们只去追那些基督徒吗？你知道你的邻居是谁吗？耶稣基督说，任何在那里的人，你们都要像对待我一样对待他们。去找他们，在寻找为社区谋福利的理由时要刻意为之。

因为当耶稣讲到好撒玛利亚人的故事时，他就是在告诉你谁是你的邻居。他说，一个犹太人走在路上，这时一个撒玛利亚人经过。那个犹太人流血躺在路上，而撒玛利亚人恨他们彼此。耶稣基督本可以这样说：一个穿白袍的KKK成员流着血躺在路上，这时一个非裔美国人经过；或者一个塞尔维亚人躺在路上，一个科索沃人经过；或者一个纳粹躺在路上流血快要死了，这时一个犹太人经过。

他想说的是，在你的道路上任何人都是你的邻居，因为你就是我的任何一个人。看看我做了什么。你们谈论社会正义的资源。你们谈论打破障碍的资源。

没有什么能比这更有效了，但如果你想成为邻居，首先你需要一个邻居。你需要看到耶稣基督就像在那个故事中那样出现，而你是躺在路上的人，他做了什么？这个故事说了什么？他说，他下来把你扶起来，把他自己的位置让给你。

这就是耶稣所做的。你躺在路上，他把你抬起来并给了你他的地位。他给了你他的正直和地位。他给了你他的公义，并替你受罚，直到你为他的怜悯而惊讶不已。

你将永远无法拥有提供这种怜悯的能力。### 结束祷告 让我们祷告。我们感谢你，主，赐给我们这样的资源。这是威力巨大的东西。

这就像一根导火索。我们只需要点燃它。但现在，请帮助我们点燃它。感谢大家收听《福音与生活播客》。
