# Jesus as Prophet (Part 2) / Jesus as Prophet (Part 2)

## Chinese Translation / 中文翻译 / English Transcript

Welcome to Gospel in Life. Christianity isn't just a spiritual practice or set of moral teachings. At its heart, it's the person of Jesus actively pursuing us.

In today's teaching, Tim Keller unpacks how Jesus actively seeks us, reveals truth to us, and calls us to Himself. Let me read from Luke, chapter 24, it's printed in your bulletin. It's very end of the Gospel of Luke, verses 44 to 53, okay, and he said to them, this is what I told you while I was still with you.

Everything must be fulfilled. That is written about me in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the Psalms. Then he opened their minds so that they could understand the scriptures.

He told them, this is what is written. The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day. And repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.

You are witnesses of these things. I am going to send you what my father has promised, but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high. And when he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethlehem, he lifted up his hands and blessed them.

And while he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven. And then they worshipped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy. And they stayed continually in the temple, praising God.

This is God's word. Now many people today think of Christianity as a set of beliefs that you take up, something you decide upon. Here's a set of beliefs, here's a set of ethical guidelines, and you take them up.

You pick them up. You've decided this is what I want to do. This is what I want to be.

The Bible, however, describes Christianity in very different terms, almost opposite terms. The Bible says that Christianity is not something that you choose so much. Oh, there's a choice involved.

It's something that comes upon you. It's not something that picks you up. It's not something that you pick up.

It's something that picks you up. It's not something that you take up. It's something that takes you up.

It's not something that you just decide to do, but rather it's always something that comes at you. It's a force, and you do make a choice. You do make a choice, but it's always in response to something that you feel is arguing with you.

Something you feel is coming after you. Something that you feel is seeking you out, always. What is it?

It sounds mysterious, doesn't it? I tell you that you don't know real Christianity, boy, it sounds so arrogant, but it is true. I tell you, you don't understand real Christianity unless you've had that same sense.

The sense of something having come after you, something arguing with you, something grabbing you by the neck, something making you think about things that you don't really want to think, helping you see things that you've never really seen before, unless you sense that something is coming upon you and picking you up and taking you up, and in response to that, you have to make a decision and in response to that, unless that's happening, you haven't really experienced real Christianity. It sounds so exotic, doesn't it, thrilling, mysterious? What is it?

What is it that comes after you? I'll tell you what it is. It's Jesus Christ the Revealer.

What we're looking at today, and what we see depicted here, is that Jesus Christ is not a passive Savior. Jesus is not depicted by the Bible as somebody who has died on the cross to deal with guilt and to deal with evil, and then he sort of sits back and he waits for you to figure it out. It doesn't do that at all.

Instead, he comes after us. He is not just a priest, he's a prophet, he's not just a Redeemer, he's a Revealer. He's not just someone who makes a provision for us, but he comes and he tells us about it.

He comes after us. It's him. This passage tells us that after the resurrection, he comes to his disciples and opens their mind up.

And the Bible tells us that that continues to happen today, that through the Holy Spirit he comes after us. What am I talking about? It's what Jesus says in the book of John when he says, you have not chosen me, I have chosen you.

Or it's what Jesus says in Matthew 11 where he says, no one knows the Father, but the Son. And the one to whom ever the Son chooses to reveal him. Let me say that again.

No one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. See Jesus says, I'm the Revealer, I come to you, I let you in, I show you the Father. It's very natural, and yet I'll try to show you here in the next 60 seconds, it's illogical, but it's very natural to say in our modern day, that's not fair, that's so narrow-minded.

Why would Jesus say he's the only way to the Father, he's the only one who can reveal? That's not fair, that's not just, that's too narrow, let me ask you a question. What did people say when Jonas Salk, remember Jonas Salk who came up with a polio vaccine?

And Jonas Salk came up and said, I have discovered the only cure for polio or the vaccine for polio. I have discovered it. What did everybody say?

Did they say that couldn't be, how unfair, that one scientist would find the cure for polio and nobody else would? Is that what happened? Did everybody say, well, that can't be, I mean, why would one scientist know it?

Not all scientists, no, everybody knew that if you wanted to get the vaccine for polio, you had to go to Jonas Salk. If you wanted deliverance, you had to go to him because he alone knew it and he alone could reveal the way out. Why?

There was nobody upset about it, they're upset about Jesus saying, I show you the way to the Father, they're not upset about Jonas Salk, why? The reason they weren't upset about the polio issue was they knew it wasn't a matter of if it's fair, just if it's true. It doesn't matter if his claims are just, if they're true, if he really knew what he said he knew, then he was the way.

That's just the way it is. And Jesus says, that's the way it is. And we're going to try to show you in a minute why he's able to say that.

But just to start, introduction, this is an aspect of the message of the Christian faith, which is very important to know. It's very practical, it's very mysterious. In fact, it's almost romantic, to be honest, there's a romance to it.

Christianity is something that comes and gets you, because Jesus is not simply a king and a redeemer. He's also a revealer of the hidden. He comes after us, and he shows us the truth.

Now, let's take a look at this. Traditionally, and theologically and historically, this is called the prophetic ministry of Christ. The Bible says, Jesus is prophet, priest, and king.

He's a prophet, he's a priest, and a king. And today we're looking at his prophetic ministry. And let me just talk to you about it by looking at this passage where we see him engaged in it.

And let's just look at it under three headings. What he does, why he does it, and how he does it. What, why, how?

What, why, and how? I'm saying that, so I remember it. And not so, I don't think you hear it.

What, why, and how? What does he do? He gives us eyes.

He gives us eyes. Historically, the church has understood that Jesus' prophetic ministry had two parts. An earthly and a heavenly, or an external and an internal.

Traditionally, the church understands that Jesus Christ came to earth to be a prophet, which means he comes down to earth, and he becomes a human being, and he teaches us. And he gives us verbal revelation. He tells us things about the word and the will of God.

But that's not all he does. The Bible says that's what he did as an earthly prophet in the past, but now he has a heavenly prophetic ministry in the present when through the Holy Spirit he comes and he opens our minds to the truth. So there's a past ministry and a present prophetic ministry, an earthly ministry and a heavenly ministry, or let me put it another way.

The other way to put it is that there's an external, he gives us the external word and the internal word. The external word. When he came to earth and he taught us, and we have his teaching.

Where it is, it's verbal, it's propositional, it's in principles, it's on a piece of paper. It's wonderful what you have in the Scripture. This great set of verses by George Herbert that is on the title page about the Scripture.

What I like so much, he's talking about the Scripture, he says, this is such great poetry. This is the thankful glass that mends the looker's eye. This is the well that washes what it shows.

Who can endure this praise so much? But here's my favorite part, he's talking about the Scripture, he says, heaven lies flat in thee, subject to every mountain's bended knee. Heaven lies flat.

Jesus has put what you need for heaven, the glories of heaven, the glories of the heavenly realms into propositions, into words. It's there, there it is, the truth. You might say the external word, heaven lies flat in thee.

That's what an interesting way to put it, but Jesus doesn't just do that. He also comes to a spiritually and he gives us the internal word. He alums us to help us understand what's in the external word.

You see these two things right here in the passage we just read in verse 44 and 45, there it is, there's another example of it. In verse 44, this is after the resurrection, after he's been raised from the dead, he comes to his disciples and he says, this is what I told you while I was still with you. Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in Moses, the prophets, and the Psalms.

Now when he was with them on earth, he had already taught them the things that he's mentioning here. He says from the Psalms and from the law and from the prophets, he had taught them a number of things. So he refers to it.

But then, verse 45, then he opened their mind so that they could understand. It wasn't enough for him just to come the first time, he had to come the second time. It wasn't enough for him to give us the external word.

He'd already done that, but now in verse 45, he gives them the internal word. Just to complete the analogy here, there's two ways in which illumination fails to happen physically. Either my eye might work, but there'd be no light, or the light may be on, but my eye doesn't work.

Light but no eye, eye but no light. Light is necessary for me to see, even if my eye works, why? Because you see what I see out there and what you see up here.

You don't really see me, obviously. You see, the light reflected off of me, it's bouncing off of me, and it's hitting your retina, actually. So without light, your eye may work fine, but you won't see what's up here.

On the other hand, all the light in the world won't help if your eye is dark, as the Bible says. If there's something wrong with your eye, if it's not sensitive to stimuli, now you have to have both, or you don't have illumination. Now, secondly, let's put it another way.

At the non-physical level, you have to have both things in order to have illumination. Let me give you an example. Here's a man and his family life's a mess.

In particular, let's say here's a father, and he can't control his daughter, his young teenage daughter. She's indulged in self-destructive behavior. She's always antagonistic to him.

She's dependent on him and yet she hates him. She's petulant and yet self-destructive and so on. He goes to counseling, and the counselor talks to the daughter, he talks to the father, he talks to the family, and so on.

Finally, the counselor sits down with the father and he says, the main reason why your daughter is in the condition she's in is you. The main reason is the way in which you've treated her, the way in which you have let her completely depend on her. You're always bailing her out.

You're never making her, allowing her to experience the consequences of her behavior. A lot of you know what I'm talking about here. The counselor lays this out to the father and it's a new idea.

He's never really heard it before. A whole new concept never thought of it. It's light.

It's a new concept because the counselor is standing in the shoes of the prophet and the counselor is bringing the external word, but the counselor is a human being and human beings can only bring the external word to another human being. Because if the counselor is going to be a success, illumination won't happen unless besides the new concept, the father has the eyes in the heart to grasp the concept, and you know that may not happen. In fact, it probably won't happen for what I know about fathers and what I know about situations like that.

The father is either going to say, here comes the light, here comes the concept, enabling behavior or whatever you want to call it, and the father says, nonsense. I only do what any father would do. I love my daughter or even, he might even say, oh yes, I agree, but just not get it.

Just not sink in. It doesn't change his behavior. He still is not able to draw the line.

He's still not able to put his foot down. He's still not able to give her what she really needs. And it may not be till years later that with tears, illumination finally happens sometimes when it's too late, sometimes after a terrible tragedy.

And the father says, you know, the counselor years ago told me this, and I agreed with him, but now I really see, I didn't get it, I didn't see it. You see, there has to both be light and eyes, and this is the glory of Jesus. That counselor is a human counselor.

And one human counselor, a human prophet can never do anything else, but give the external word to another human being. But don't you see for us to get illumination, you've got to have the internal word too. You have to not only have light, but eyes.

And this is the one of the great glories. This is a promise. You know, let me tell you something.

This may be true. It may not be true. Now I think it's true.

I would die for it. But I'm saying to you, you know, the listener, this may be true, this may not be true. But there's no other religion, no other faith that even offers this.

You want to know that. Don't you see, this Bible is full of human prophets. And they're great.

Men and women who brought the Word of God, they're great. We're glad we have them. And all the other religions have prophets too.

Men and women who bring the Word of God and bring the truth, bring the truth, talk about reality. That's great. But all they can possibly do, if they're human beings, if they're only prophets, if they're only human, all they can do is bring the external Word.

You know what we need? We don't just need a counselor. We need a wonderful counselor.

Mighty God, Prince of Peace. See the great thing about Jesus is that he's not only a human prophet. He's a divine prophet.

He's not only human, he's also God. He not only brings us the external Word, but he then brings us the internal Word. He not only gives us the light, but he gives us the eyes, and that's no other prophet can do that.

No other prophet can even offer it. He opened their minds so that they could understand the things that he had told them. Isn't that great?

The greatest thing that Paul could ask for his friends and Ephesians, he prays to the Lord for what? He says, I'm praying to the Lord. He says in Ephesians 118, that the eyes of your heart would be enlightened so that you can know the things that I've told you, so you can grasp them.

Paul knew his limitations. He was a human prophet only, and everybody in this room we desperately need not just a human prophet. That's enough.

Let me tell you something. Every other philosophy, anybody who sells you a philosophy or sells you a religion that doesn't have both the external and the internal Word, both the light and the eyes is passing you bad money. That's what's the glory of this faith here.

You see, you've got plenty of religions and philosophies that simply give you the rules. They say, there it is, the external Word. Now try your best.

Do it. Do it. And then you've got other kinds of faith and religions that are all internal Word.

It's all mystical. You look into yourself. You look at your navel.

We can't tell you what to do. You have to look inside yourself and get in touch with your own self and your own feelings. You see, you've got religions that have the internal Word only, and they're just a morass of subjective mysticism, and you've got religions that have the external Word only, but not this.

This is Christianity. This may be true. This may not be true.

I'm telling you. But nobody else offers this. A redeemer who's a prophet.

A prophet who's a redeemer, you see, a man who's a God, a God who's a man. And therefore he comes and he opens our minds as well as teaches us both. Now why does he do it?

So that's what he does. He gives his eyes. And secondly, why does he do it?

And the reason he does it is because we're spiritually blind. Let's take a moment to define that. The reason we need this is because he's spiritually blind.

In verse 45, it says, when he opened their minds, so they could understand the scriptures, the Word opened is significant. As you know, this was originally written in Greek, and the Word opened is a translation of a particular Greek word. There were two different Greek words that could be used here.

One is a noigo, one is dia noigo. A little word dia is the word for through. Now a noigo means to open something like a door, something that's already got a latch, something that's already got a provision for opening.

So you use the Greek word a noigo with a door, but the word dia noigo doesn't just simply mean to open. It means to break open. It means to bust open.

It means to break in. It wouldn't use the word dia noigo with a door unless it was a locked door. You use the word dia noigo with something like a mountain.

I open the mountain with my tunnel, you see. It means to break through two different Greek words. Which one do you think Luke uses?

You just take a guess. He will not talk about the human mind or the human soul, like a door. He talks about the human mind or the human soul, like a mountain, layers and layers of obstacles to the truth, impenetrable.

What Luke is saying is that the natural human mind until Jesus gets to it is spiritually blind. It's blind. Now what does that mean?

You know, one illustration you can use is you think of the eye itself. Very often as a person gets older, something develops on the eye called a cataract. And a cataract is a clouding up or a misting up an opaqueness that develops where there should be transparency.

That's a perfect analogy, a much better analogy than other kinds of analogies, to explain the human soul. God made the human soul with a transparency. We are different than the animals.

We are different than the plants. We honor the animals and we honor the plants as part of God's creation. But they're not in the image of God.

What does that mean? They don't have a spiritual faculty. They don't have a capacity for truth.

They don't have a capacity for reason, but they don't have a capacity for a real personal connection with Jesus, with God. And yet the Bible says, naturally because of sin, there is an opaqueness over top of our soul, so that it has to be broken through. Another way to put it is we have cataracts on our soul.

And you know what? You can rub your eye all you want that will not get rid of cataracts. You can rub it and rub it and rub it and rub it.

You can wash it and wash it and wash it, that will not get rid of cataracts, there needs to be an intervention. There needs to be a medical intervention. Somebody that has skills that you don't have, there needs to be a surgeon.

That's exactly what Jesus is. The reason He's a prophet, not just a human prophet. See the idea, if you think all you need is the truth.

You say, well, I just need somebody to inform me, that's all I need. You don't realize the depth of your blindness. You don't just need the light, you need eyes, but you need someone to take the opaqueness off.

That's what the surgeon does. That's what the medical intervention does. And that's what you need more than anything else.

Now you say, what do you mean by opaqueness? What is it? Very, very important, listen carefully.

The spiritual blindness is not a lack of reason. It's very possible for a person who is totally spiritually blind to read the Bible and accept it, to say, yes, I see that Jesus died for my sins. I think that's great.

I like that. That's important. I believe it.

It's not, to be spiritually blind doesn't mean that you can't intellectually comprehend something from the Bible. In fact, it's natural and normal for people when they become Christians to say, last year I became a Christian, but there was never a time in my life where I didn't actually believe in the basic propositions of the Christian faith. It's very typical for a person to say, I became a Christian last year, but there was never a time in which I didn't believe in the resurrection.

I didn't believe in the crucifixion. I didn't believe in the basic propositions of the Christian faith. People wouldn't, what do they mean when they say they became a Christian?

Here's what they mean. The opaqueness is not an inability to comprehend. It's not an inability to reason.

It's not a rational inability. It's not some kind of operation of the mind. Jean Piaget talks about the various operations that develop as a kid gets older.

You have sensory motor development, you have six stages of it and you have concrete operations and abstract operations. He's talking about the various sorts of mental abilities and operations, logical operations and transactions that you do mentally. When we talk about spiritual blindness, we're not saying, we're talking about any of that.

Spiritual blindness is not the inability to see the truth, but it's the inability to value it, to appreciate it. Now the problem with that word is in English, appreciate is a fairly wimpy word. We appreciate you and there's a song where it says, Lord, we appreciate you and it sounds I've ever sung it.

It sounds so wimpy. We appreciate you, but it's not. It's a good word and here's why and I'm going to keep with it and this is the heart of what this opaqueness is and what spiritual blindness is.

The word deep appreciate means something loses its value, therefore it loses its economic power, it loses its clout, it loses its how much it can influence. You get a diamond, it's valuable. What does that mean?

You can do things with that. You can get things done with it, there's value to it. You have a diamond and you can go places, you can do things.

You can get things for it, that's valuable. When something deep appreciates it loses value, when something appreciates it gains value, but the word appreciate in the English language can also mean that what increases is your realization of the value of something, your realization of the power of something, your realization of the influence of something. When a person says, I became a Christian last year, though I always believed intellectually in the Bible and intellectually in the Christian faith, but last year I saw.

What does it mean? What does she mean when she talks like that? Here's what she means.

I always knew Jesus died for me, says a new Christian, but I never realized that I need to know that Jesus loves me more than anything else in the world. I need to know that deep down underneath that I didn't believe that I'm loved, but when I one day, last year, I realized that what Jesus did for me is the thing that I need most of all. It revolutionized me when I realized that when I saw the value of what he's done for me, I suddenly realized I don't have to be like this, I don't have to be like this.

This is the root of all my problems. Now, that kind of language means that the cataracts have come off. She saw, but she didn't see.

You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger brother. In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who try to earn his love by being good. In his book, The prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental older brother and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal, extravagant grace.

Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith, The prodigal God will help you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way.

If some of you stock analyst types, if suppose I could send you back in a time machine but there's nothing that a stock analyst would rather have than a trip back about five years. Isn't that right? Just go back five years, ten years, whatever, send you back and you sit down.

You're back in time now and you sit down with the Wall Street Journal and you start to read the stock stuff and you're sitting alongside of your stock analyst friends and of course, they're there from their own time and they don't know what you know. They don't know anything about the future and you're going down a list and all of a sudden you come to Microsoft and you say, oh my gosh, it's selling for that. If I buy a thousand shares of that, I'll be a quadrillion zillionaire in seven years.

I will do everything I can. See, I'm going to borrow, I'm going to beg, I'm going to do anything I can to buy everything I'll put. How do you know?

You know what they don't know. They go down all these little lines and one of them jumps out at you says Microsoft, why? You can appreciate it.

You know the value of it. You know the influence of that information. There's information on that line.

Nobody else can see what it means. Nobody else can see the significance of the information. Nobody can see that knowing that will make all the difference.

They can't appreciate it. They're blind. They don't have eyes, you see, but you do.

What does it mean to become a Christian? It means to look at stuff that you've looked at for years and suddenly it jumps out of you and you say, what's the matter with me? How could I have never seen the power of this?

How could I have never seen the meaning of this? How could I have never seen the value of this? That's what the spiritual blindness is.

I know there's people in this room who say, well, of course I'm a Christian, I've always believed. And yet that's never happened to you. You have no idea what that experience is like.

And you're blind. You're spiritually blind. You need to have someone break through, say, break through, the anoint go, open some years ago.

There were two women that I was counseling back in my first church in a little town and I didn't know much about counseling. They both came to me within a week of each other and they had the same problem. They were facing a very devastating loss in their lives.

And they came to a pastor. Actually, there was no counselors in town, so people came to pastors back then because there was nobody else to talk to about their problems. And they came on in at various times.

In both cases, I laid out a passage of Scripture and then I gave them a book, the same passage, the same book, the same basic theme. And a couple of, maybe a month later, I saw both of them and the one woman came back and said, you know what? She says, when I began to see what God has given me and what I have in Jesus, I began to realize, if I have that, then I can bear the loss of this.

And I could see she was healing. And the other woman, same age, same situation, same Bible passage, same book. She came back and she says, yeah, well, that's very nice.

And I guess I believe it. But what good is that if I have lost the thing that I've lost? She was inconsolable and she was broken from what I can tell permanently.

What was the difference between them? Illumination, the same truth, but the one woman was able to appreciate the truth. She was able to see the value of the truth.

She was able to sense the power of the truth and the other woman did not. Let me tell you what illumination means. You say, I want peace, friends, until the goodness of God is more real to you than all of the threats around you.

You will never have peace. You'll be worried sick. You say, I wish I could forgive the person who's hurt me until the forgiveness of God is more real to you than all of the injustice that's been done to you.

You will never be able to overcome your bitterness. It's a matter of illumination. It's a matter of appreciation of the truth because we're blind.

And only as we break through, you want to overcome guilt, the truth has got to break through of what he's done for you. You want to overcome worry, the truth has got to break through of how good he is. You want to deal with boredom, the truth has got to break through and so on and so on.

You're blind. We're blind. Okay.

That's what he's done. He gives us eyes. Why he's done it?

Because we're blind. Lastly, how he's done it, and I guess I have to be brief about this, though I've already in a sense answered your question, that issue. How does he do it?

How does he deal with the opaqueness? How does he break through the blindness? And the answer is, it's pretty mysterious, but there's one word here that gives us a bit of a clue.

It says, then he opened their minds so they could understand the scriptures. And the word understand is a Greek word, Sunet-Me, which literally means to assemble a puzzle. And that's the best clue I can give you, look, if I lay 20 pieces of a puzzle out at random on a table, and you look at it, but then I assemble it, put it into places.

And then you look at it. What's the difference? Well, you know, it's the same 20 pieces.

You're actually not looking at one bit of different content. It's the same content, the same 20 things. But once I put them together, you see the connection.

And see, to me, I think that's probably the key principle as to what is to how Jesus does this. This is all very mysterious. Very long, listen, if you were raised in a Muslim country and you've never heard anything about Christianity and you come here and you start to listen and you learn about Christianity and as you learn about it, you love it and you say, I want to become a Christian.

That's where you're getting light and sight at the same time. But for most of us, it's different. We have the pieces of the puzzle.

We have had the light for a long time. But becoming a Christian means, though you've always had the light, you're finally getting the sight. Though you've always had the pieces you've never seen the connection of the pieces to each other and especially to you.

There's a connection. You know, when I put the 20 pieces of the puzzle together, it's hard to even think of it as 20 pieces anymore, even though it is, because the connection makes you see it as a whole, or if you're looking at one of these books of ink blotches, splotches, and somebody says, do you see anything in there and you say, no, I don't see anything. Then somebody says, oh, there's an elephant there.

Look, here's the trunk, here's the tail, here's the body, and you say, oh, and once you see that, you can't not see it. Once you see the connection, you can't see the pieces anymore. Same, no different content, no different content, the connections.

Because the closest I can come, and that's what the text is telling us, what it means to say, I understand something, you know, the word even the word understand means to stand under something. These disciples had seen the truth, but they had never stood under it. They had seen the pieces, they had never seen the connections.

And that's what it means, I don't know if I can go any further than that. You see the connections, you see the pieces, you see how it all fits. So let me ask you this, let's use this as a test.

If that's how he does it, if that's how he breaks through the blindness, he makes you connected. He shows you the connections, Jack Miller puts it this way, he says, the gospel, real Christianity consists mainly in personal pronouns. And then he says, always says it this way, he says, you know, a formal nominal Christian says, Jesus died for sins.

The Christian says, Jesus died for my sins. Jesus died for me. He suffered for me.

In other words, a Christian, see a formal nominal Christian looks up on the cross and sees the blood of Jesus running down. And a Christian sees the blood of Jesus running after you, coming after you, you know, a formal nominal Christian sees Jesus up on the cross sort of moaning. And a Christian sees Jesus looking at you and saying, it's for you I'm doing this.

You must sit down and taste my meat. You must let me serve you. You must let me die for you.

You must let me love you. You know, that's, you hear it, you sense it, connection, personal pronouns now. So I've already in a sense answered my questions.

How do you know that he's doing this for you? What are the tests to see, whether or not the illuminating ministry of Jesus Christ is operating in your life, the prophetic ministry of Jesus from heaven? How do you know it's happening?

Let me just give you three tests, number one, newness. There's always a newness about what you're learning. That's just figures.

See, deonoigo means a breakthrough. And that means if you say, and I talk very often to people like this, they say, I've always been a Christian and I say, fine, that's possible in a sense of meaning you've been a Christian from the very, very earliest years and so on. But what I want to, I have to say, let me ask you, has there ever been a time in which you looked and said, hi, I've never seen that before.

I've been totally surprised this truth revolutionizes me. Anybody, there's a real Christian knows what I'm talking about. There's a newness William Cooper puts in one of his hymns, he says, sometimes a light surprises the Christian as he sings.

This morning, don't ask me why, but when I was singing the second hymn, I heard the voice of Jesus say, it just started to surprise me. Do you know what that means? See, that's what the illuminating work of Jesus is.

I've sung that hymn a lot. That's why I chose this stupid thing. You know, I generally choose the hymns that I like.

One of the few advantages to my job, I choose the hymns I like, I like that hymn. I like how it goes from minor to major, you know, it's kind of cute, maybe some people would consider it sort of a cutesy hymn, it's a minor key, you know, and then we see the resolution. Here's the problem, here's the resolution, but in the middle of the time, it started dawn on me.

You know, I started to hear Jesus sang these things to me. What do you mean? You're a Presbyterian minister, you heard a voice?

No. Presbyterian ministers don't hear voices. We start hearing voices, we join the assemblies of God, but you know, we don't hear voices, we belong to this Presbyterian church.

But I did. Because what happened was, as William Cooper says, sometimes the light surprises the Christian as he sings, it is the sun who rises with healing in his wings. There's a surprise, there's a noonist, sometimes you feel like it's being broken through.

Does that happen to you? Has it happened to you? If not, you're still spiritually blind.

Okay, another mark, it's a connection. Another mark, of course, illumination always is characterized by an engagement of the whole person, mind, will and emotions. You notice that as he opened their minds, the scriptures, you see what happens?

He says, then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy. Why did they return to Jerusalem with great joy? Because he told them to.

He says in verse 49, go back. Don't come out here, go back and wait there, and I'm going to do something for you. And so you see you have the mind, the will and the emotions.

You don't just have the mind, it's not just that they opened, they understood the scriptures better in an intellectual way. They didn't grow simply in information, the way you kind of grow in knowledge of your computer program every week. You read a little more in the book and you try another couple of operations, nothing like that.

We're talking about spiritual understanding and you're moved to the bottom of your being. Some people cry. When they're moved, some people don't cry when they're moved.

It's not a matter of crying or not, it's a matter of being moved. They're told to do something and now they obey, return and they return but they return with joy. There's the mind, there's the emotions, the joy and the will.

Now I'm doing what I'm told. They say, go, he says go, they go. He says, return, they return, but they return with joy.

The whole being, it's one thing to get, have wonderful Bible study and to find that you cannot amend your life according to his will. Then you haven't really had this illumination. The mind, the will and the emotions are together.

There's the engagement of the whole person, but newness, the engagement of the whole person and then last mark of this illuminating work of Jesus in your life is it's always gradual. It's always unfolding. There's a place in second Peter where Peter says, we have the word of the prophets made more certain and you will do well to pay attention to it as to a light shining in a dark place until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.

I have no idea exactly what that means, but what it means is it's gradual. The light that God gives you when you have your eyes first opened to the truth and you appreciate it and you see the connection and all this stuff we've been talking about. It's gradual.

It doesn't start right away. I mean, it doesn't go right away into fullness, it more and more. You see, you pay attention to it as to a light shining in a dark place until the day you see the morning rises and the star rises in your heart and so on.

That's the reason why you see in verse 52, pardon me, in verse 45, he opens the mind to understand the scripture, but in verse 49 he says, I'm going to do more things for you. I'm going to visit power on you. I'm going to give you even more.

So go back to Jerusalem and wait for it. It's always a gradualness to it. There's always an increase.

A person who's truly illuminated sees it as a gradual thing. You see you're getting more and more and you're breaking through more and more. Now that's what he does.

He gives his eyes. That's why he does it because we're spiritually blind and that's how he does it by making connections and some ways of telling whether it's happening to you now. Now let me just conclude by applying this a little bit.

Some of you, let me just take this. If this is true, let me apply it to some of you. First of all, and I'll be real brief on this, and afterwards we go downstairs and we have questions and answers and some of you might want to, if you feel like I'm going to quickly here at the end and you wish I would explain more, come on down to these lounge afterwards and we'll have questions and answers and talk about it.

Some of you don't realize the holistic nature of Christianity. You say, I know what to do, but I don't have the power to do it. You say, I know I shouldn't blow up, but I can't control my temper.

I can't control my sexual appetites. I can't control my obsessive attitude toward work. I can't control my emotions.

You say, I know what's right, I know what I really do, but I just don't see how the power to do it. You're praying to God for power in the abstract. God doesn't work that way.

Look at the beauty of it. You say you think you know, but you don't have the power. If you don't have the power, you don't know.

Let me show you the organic way that the Christian power works. I know something about my wife and insects, and now you will too. If I see my wife reading the paper and crawling down the side of her hair is a big spider.

And I say to Kathy, I say, Kathy, there is a big spider crawling down the left side of your head on your hair. And she says, yes, I know, yes, honey. And she doesn't do anything.

I say, well, dear, I don't know that you hear me. There is a spider crawling down the left side of your head. It's getting near your face, near your skin.

And she says, yes, honey, I hear you. There's a spider crawling down the side of my head. I know she hasn't heard me.

Why? Because if she heard me, she'd be getting animated. She'd be, oh, you know, pushing it away.

She may have sort of heard me and sort of said it. So what do I do? I pull she away.

You know, this is typical. She's distracted. And by the way, when she's reading the paper, she gets very distracted.

I push the paper down and I say, there's a spider on your head. And when it sinks in, she's illuminated because her entire being, mind, will and emotion, is engaged. Now, that's the way God gives power.

Look, a lot of people will say to me, I need self-control when it comes to sex. I can't control my sexual appetites. Okay, how does the Bible help?

The Bible never says, control your sexual appetites or God will get you. He doesn't do that. Let me show you how the Bible does it.

In 1 Corinthians 6, Paul says, you are not your own. You're bought with a price. You're not your own.

You're bought with a price. No ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, therefore, flee sexual immorality. Let me say that again.

You're not your own. You're bought with a price. No ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, therefore flee sexual immorality.

Look at that. What's the secret? It's not coercion.

It's not you better control yourself sexually or God will get you. That wouldn't give you any power. People are always saying, I know what to do, and I don't have the power to do it.

What does Paul say? He says, no ye not. There it is.

He says, look at what Jesus has done for you. You're not your own. You're bought with a price.

Look at what Jesus has put in you. You're a temple of the Holy Spirit. He says, you know why you don't have any problem with controlling your sexual appetites?

You don't know. These things. No ye not.

Power comes with the knowledge. You're a whole being. God doesn't separate you out.

You can't say, well, I know what to do. I just don't have enough willpower. That's an abstract, that's a stoic, that's a pagan, that's a Greek, that's a modern, is a secular way of thinking.

What you've got to know is that Jesus Christ has given me truth. And if I let it affect me, if I look at it, if I say, teach me. Set my heart on fire with it.

If you look at it, don't you know, don't you know, don't you know, and the more you know, the more you will be able. The more you know, the more you'll be able. That's what's so beautiful about this.

You say, you don't have the power, I say, you need Jesus to teach your heart. And he can and he will and he wants to. Talk to people, study, pray over what you study, reflect on it, don't give up.

Don't just look at this stuff and say, oh, I know it. Say, I don't know it. Like I should and I'm going to know it better and I'm going to use every means possible.

I'm going to worship in it, I'm going to pray it in, I'm going to sing it in. I'm going to talk to people and I'm going to, but in it all, I'm going to say, Lord Jesus, open the scripture, open my mind to the scripture. Can you do that?

Will you do that? If you'll do that, there's the key. Okay, one more thing.

Some of you are absolutely and totally blind today, spiritually blind. He says the ones who are sure that there's nothing wrong are the ones who are totally blind. The ones who have begun to have their blindness, their spiritual blindness healed are the ones who know that they don't see you right.

Who are you? Which one are you? The same Jesus Christ who raised Lazarus from the dead, however, can also raise your soul from the dead.

And somebody says, well, I'm spiritually blind. What am I supposed to do about it? It's very simple.

Jesus already told you, I'll just reiterate it. As soon as you say, I don't see, at that very second, you've begun to see. As soon as you know that you don't see, Jesus Christ is helping you to actually say that and you're finally responding to what he's doing.

So the moment you say I don't see, that moment you begin to see, the moment you say I'm blind, that moment your blindness begins to be healed. That's the beauty of the gospel. That's grace.

Are you willing to admit that? Or is there anybody here who says this is primitive and obscene? I'm a good person.

I'm a moral person. I don't need all this hokey stuff. I don't need all this dramatic stuff.

I'm as good a person as possible. I'm as decent a person as possible. You're blind.

I stick my life on it. I'm more sure about that than you could, and I'm sure about that as anything. But say I don't see and you do.

And say I do see and you don't. Gospel, Christianity. That's the way it works.

Hey, one more thing. Christian friends. Oh, well, Christian friends, on a very cold day like today, if you leave a pale of water out, you can't just break the ice on it once.

You have to keep breaking the ice. And even if Jesus gets rid of your cataracts when you first become a Christian, it's still possible, you know, for your eye to cloud up. It's possible for it to come back and you have to go back to the doctor.

And that's true spiritually as well. Can you remember when the Word of God seems so radiant to you and when the truth of God seems silverwhelming to you? Let me ask you.

Is it feel that way this week? This last week? You see, unless you're continually breaking the ice and continually going back to them, illumination is growing.

It's a growing thing. The truth of God is like a great ocean. And we're all like little children paddling along, paddling around on the outskirts of this incredible ocean.

No further in than three inches in the surf. We haven't even begun. Have you?

Do you sense God continually giving you greater and greater spiritual understanding? Do you feel that you're being led through a kind of mansion and every room is greater and greater and more ornate and more beautiful and grand and high vaulted? Do you sense that you're growing in your understanding of truth and you're grasping your understanding of truth and that you haven't hardly even begun?

There is nothing more inappropriate than a smug Christian who thinks he or she knows it. There is nothing more inappropriate than a bored Christian who thinks he or she knows it. Smugness or boredom simply means that your eyes have started crowding up again.

Jesus is the light, rejoice in his light. He is not just a counselor, he's the wonderful counselor. Let's pray.

Father, we ask that you would help us, first of all, to see that we don't. We pray for that first. We pray for the humility and the candor that leads us to say to your son, I don't see a right, touch me again.

I also pray that you would help us to be a church and a community where we lay out your son's teaching, where we study his external word, but always with the understanding that not our smarts and not our great teaching ability but only the illumination of your son's spiritual work will ever open our minds. So give us that desire for anointing, that desire for the spiritual work and yet also a kind of hard-nosed and rock-ribbed desire to master the truth. We pray that we be a community like that and we be a place where people are constantly having their minds open and that there be constant breakthroughs of the truth.

We thank you that this is a place where that can happen. We ask that it would become a place that could happen with your help. We ask it in Jesus' name.

Amen. Thanks for listening to today's teaching. It's our prayer that you were encouraged by it and that it helped you apply the gospel to your life and share it with others.

欢迎来到《生命中的福音》。基督教不仅仅是灵性实践或道德教诲。它的核心是耶稣主动追求我们。今天，提摩太·基勒（Tim Keller）将为我们讲解耶稣如何主动寻找我们、向我们揭示真理，并呼召我们归向祂。

让我读一读路加福音第24章的内容，它印在你们的圣餐单上。这是路加福音的最后一部分，从第44节到53节。他对他们说：“正如我从前与你们在一起的时候所告诉你们的。” “这一切必须应验在耶稣身上，正如摩西律法、先知书和诗篇上所记写的。

”然后他打开他们的心窍，使他们能明白圣经。他对他们说：“这就是我以前告诉你们的话。基督要受苦，第三天从死里复活。并且要在祂的名里传悔改赦罪的信息给万民，从耶路撒冷开始。

” “你们是这些事的见证人。”我要把父所应许的浇灌在你们身上，但你们要留在城里直到蒙了从上头来的力量。然后耶稣领他们到靠近伯利恒的路上，举手给他们祝福。正当他祝福的时候，他就离开他们升天了。

他们就俯伏在祂面前，大大地欢喜，回耶路撒冷去， 常在殿里称颂神。这是上帝的话语。现在很多人认为基督教是一套你接受的信仰体系，一些你决定要遵循的东西。这里有几条信念，还有一些道德准则，你接受了它们。

你选择了这些，你决定了你要这样做，你要成为这样的人。然而，圣经描述基督教的方式却完全不同，几乎可以说是相反的。圣经说，基督教并不是你选择的那么多。当然，这里涉及一个选择的问题。

它是一种降临在你身上的东西。这不是你去寻找的东西，也不是你去拿取的东西。它是你被寻找的对象。不是你接受的东西，而是你被接纳的人。

**这是一段非常有力的话，愿我们都能深刻理解并实践其中的真理**。这不是你决定去做的事情，而是一种总是迎面而来的力量。你会做出选择，但这种选择总是在回应某种感觉——好像有什么在与你争辩。有一种感觉，好像有什么在追着你。

有一种感觉，好像有什么在寻找你。这到底是什么？听起来很神秘吧？我告诉你，你还不真正了解基督教，因为它听起来如此傲慢，但这确实是真的。

我说过，除非你也曾有过同样的感受，否则你无法真正理解基督教。那种感觉，好像有什么在追着你，与你争辩，抓住你的脖子，让你思考一些你不想去想的事情，帮助你看清一些从未见过的东西——除非你感觉到有某种力量正在接近你、把你抓起并带你走。然后你必须做出回应，做出决定。如果没有这种经历，你就没有真正体验到基督教。

听起来如此神秘而令人激动，不是吗？这到底是什么？那到底是什么在追着你呢？告诉你吧，是耶稣基督——启示者。

今天我们要看的，这里所描绘的，就是耶稣基督不是一个被动的救主。圣经并没有将他描述为一个仅仅在十字架上死去以解决罪恶和邪恶问题的人，然后就坐下来等待你去理解。它不是这样的。相反，他是来追我们的。

他不只是祭司，还是先知；不只是救赎者，更是启示者。他不只是为我们提供帮助，而是亲自告诉我们这些事情。他追着我们而来。就是他。

这段经文告诉我们，在复活之后，耶稣来到他的门徒面前，开启他们的心智。圣经还告诉我们，这种经历今天仍在继续，通过圣灵，耶稣仍然在追我们。我所说的到底是什么？这就是约翰福音中耶稣所说的话：“你们拣选了我，其实是我拣选了你们。

” 或者就像马太福音11章里耶稣所说的：“除了父，没有人知道子；除了子和子愿意指示的，也没有人知道父。”让我再重复一遍。没有人认识父神，除非是子，以及子愿意向谁揭示。耶稣说这话时，他就是那个揭示者，他来到你面前，让你明白，让他带你去见父神。

这听起来很自然，但如果我们用现代的眼光来看，却显得不公平，太狭隘了。为什么耶稣会说他是通往父神的唯一道路？他又是如何揭示这一切的？这不公平，不公正，太狭隘了吧？

让我问你们一个问题：还记得约纳森·萨克尔（Jonas Salk）吗？他发明了防治小儿麻痹症的疫苗。当他说：“我发现了治愈小儿麻痹症的方法。”大家会怎么反应呢？

他们会不会说：“这不可能，一个科学家怎么可能找到治疗小儿麻痹症的方法而其他人找不到？”事实真的如此吗？大家是不是说：“不，那怎么可能？为什么只有一个人能找到答案？

” 不是所有科学家都这样想。事实上，大家都明白，如果你想要得到小儿麻痹症的疫苗，就必须去找约纳森·萨克尔。如果你需要解救，也必须去找他，因为只有他知道那个方法，并且也只有他能揭示出路。为什么会这样呢？

没有人对此感到不满，他们只是对耶稣说：“我带你见父神。”感到不满，为什么？因为他们知道这不在于是否公平或公正，而在于是否真实。如果他的说法是真的，如果他真的知道自己所宣称的知识，那么他就是那条路。

这就是事实。而耶稣说的也是这个事实。我们将在接下来的时间里向你们展示这一点。但首先，让我们简要介绍一下：这是基督教信仰的一个重要方面，既实用又神秘。

事实上，它甚至带有一种浪漫感，很迷人。基督教是一种让你主动接受的东西，因为耶稣不仅仅是国王和救赎者。他还是揭示隐藏事物的启示者。他走在我们后面，向我们展示真理。

现在让我们来看一下这一点。从传统、神学和历史的角度来说，这被称为基督的先知职分。圣经说，耶稣是先知、祭司和君王。他是先知，也是祭司和君王。

今天我们来探讨他的先知职分。让我通过这个段落向你们介绍一下。我们可以从三个方面来看待它：他做了什么，为什么这么做，以及他是如何做的。做什么？

为什么做？怎么做？做什么？为什么？

怎么做？我说这些是为了记住它们，并不是说你们没有听到过。做什么？为什么？

怎么做？他给了我们眼睛。他给了我们眼睛。历史上，教会一直理解耶稣的先知职分有两个方面：地上和天上，或者说是外部和内部。

传统上，教会认为耶稣基督来到世上是要成为一位先知，**这意味着他降临到人间，成为一个人类，并教导我们，给予我们口头启示，告诉我们关于上帝的话语和旨意。**但这并不是他所做的全部。圣经说，他在过去作为地上先知所做的一切，但现在他有一个天上的先知职分，在现在通过圣灵来到我们中间，开启我们的思维，使我们明白真理。所以有过去的职分和现在的先知职分，有地上的职分和天上的职分。

或者说，从另一个角度来看，就是外部和内部的启示。外部的启示。当他降临人间教导我们时，我们现在拥有了他的教诲。这些是口头的、命题的、原则性的，在纸上记录下来的东西。

圣经中所记载的内容真是美妙无比。乔治·赫伯特在书名页上的一段关于圣经的伟大诗句也值得一提。他谈到圣经时说，这是多么美妙的诗歌啊。这就像能治愈观者眼睛的酒杯，也像是能够洗净所见之物的泉源。

谁能承受这样的赞美呢？但我最喜欢的部分是，他说：天平躺在你身上，每座山都要屈膝俯首。天平平躺于此。耶稣已经为你准备了通往天堂所需的一切，天堂的荣耀，天上世界的荣光都化作了话语和命题。

真理就在那里，在这里。你可以这样说，外在的话语说：天平平躺在你身上。这是一个多么有趣的说法，但耶稣不仅仅这样做。他还来到我们灵性上，赐给我们内在的话语，帮助我们理解外在话语的意义。

正如我们在刚刚读过的经文44节和45节中所见，这里又是一个例子。在44节中，这是复活之后，他从死里复活后，来向门徒显现，并说：这一切我以前与你们同在的时候都告诉过你们了，这一切必须应验在关于我的摩西、先知和诗篇上。当他在地上时，他已经教导他们许多事情。他说这些话都是从摩西、律法书和先知书中来的。

所以他提到了这一点。但紧接着45节，他开启他们的理解力，使他们能够明白。仅仅第一次来到是不够的，他还必须第二次来。不仅仅是给了我们外在的话语。

他已经做了这件事，但在45节中，他又赐给他们内在的话语。为了完成这个类比，在物理上光照无法发生有两种情况：要么我的眼睛正常工作但没有光，要么有光但我的眼睛不工作。有光但无眼，有眼但无光。光是让我看见的必要条件，即使我的眼睛正常工作，为什么？

因为你看我所看到的东西，你看到我所看到的天空。你其实看不见我，当然了。这是因为光反射在我身上，然后又反弹到你的视网膜上。所以如果没有光，你的眼睛可能很好使，但你看不到这里的东西。

相反，世界上所有的光也无济于事，正如圣经所说。如果眼睛有问题，对刺激不敏感的话，即使有光也不行。现在，第二点，我们换个角度来说。在非物理层面，你需要两者兼备才能获得光照。

让我举个例子。这里有一个人，他的家庭生活一团糟。特别是说，这里有个父亲，他无法控制自己的女儿，一个年轻的十几岁女孩。她沉迷于自毁行为，总是对他充满敌意。

她依赖他，却又恨他。她任性且自毁。他去咨询，咨询师跟女儿谈过，也跟他谈过，还和家人一起讨论。最后，咨询师坐下来对父亲说，你女儿现在的状况主要是因为你。

主要原因是你的对待方式，以及你让她完全依赖自己。你总是救她于水火之中，从不让她体验行为的后果。你们中很多人都知道我在说什么。咨询师把这番话告诉了父亲，这是一个全新的理念。

他以前从未听说过这个观点，这是一种全新的概念。因为咨询师站在先知的角度，带来了外部的话语，但咨询师毕竟是人，只能将外部的话语传达给人类。如果咨询师要成功，光的启示就不会发生，除非除了新的理念之外，这位父亲还有内心的洞察力去理解这一概念。而你明白这可能不会发生。

事实上，根据我对父亲和类似情况的了解，这种情况很可能不会发生。父亲可能会说：“这里来了光明，来了概念，促使行为或者你想要称呼的任何东西。”但父亲会说：“胡扯。我只是在做任何一个父亲都会做的事情。

我爱我的女儿。”甚至他可能还会说：“哦，是的，我同意，只是没搞懂。” 没有真正理解。这并没有改变他的行为。

他仍然无法划清界限。仍然不能坚定立场。仍然无法给予她真正需要的东西。有时多年后，在泪水和启示中，才恍然大悟，但有时候已经太迟了，有时候是在一场可怕的悲剧之后。

父亲说：“你知道几年前咨询师告诉我这个，我同意他的话，但现在我真的明白了，我没有理解。”你看，必须要有光明和眼睛，这就是耶稣的荣耀。这位咨询师是人类咨询师。一位人类咨询师、人类先知所能做的就是给予另一人类以外部的话语。

但是，你们难道没有看到吗？只有我们有了内在的话语才能获得启示。不仅要接受光，还要有眼睛。这是极大的荣耀。

这是一个承诺。让我告诉你一件事： 这可能是真的。这可能不是真的。现在我认为是真的。

我愿意为此而死。但我要对你说，听众，这可能是真的，这可能不是真的。但是没有任何其他宗教、信仰能提供这一点。你想知道吗？

你看，《圣经》充满了人类先知。他们伟大无比。是带来上帝话语的男女，他们是伟大的。我们很高兴有他们。

其他所有宗教也有先知。是带来上帝的话语和真理的人，谈论现实。这很伟大。但作为人类，如果只是先知、只是人类所能做的就是传递外部的话语。

**我们需要什么？我们不仅仅需要咨询师。****我们需要一位奇妙的咨询师。**全能的神，和平之王。

耶稣的伟大之处在于他不仅是人类先知，还是神的先知。他不仅是人，还是神。他不仅给我们带来外在的话语，还带来了内在的话语。他不仅赐给我们光明，还赐给我们眼睛，这是其他先知做不到的。

没有任何先知能做到这一点。他开启了他们的心智，使他们能够理解他所告诉他们的事情。这不是很棒吗？保罗为他的朋友们和以弗所人祷告时，向主祈求什么？

他说：“我为你们祈祷。”他在以弗所书1章18节中说：“愿你们的灵明心得开悟，好知道他向我们这些有信心之人的恩典是何等丰盛。” 保罗深知自己的局限。他只是一个凡人先知，而我们每一个人在这个房间里都迫切需要的不仅仅是一个凡人先知。

这一点很重要。让我告诉你一件事：每一个其他哲学体系或任何试图兜售没有内外话语、没有光明与眼睛的宗教和哲学的人，都在向你兜售劣质货品。这就是这种信仰的伟大之处。你看，有很多宗教和哲学只给你规定规则。

他们说：“这里有外在的话语，你自己去努力吧。” 而另一种信仰和宗教则全都是内在的话语。它全是神秘主义，你要审视自己，看自己的肚脐眼。我们无法告诉你该怎么做。

你必须自己审视内心，与自己的感受联系起来。你看，有一种宗教只有内在话语，只是主观的神秘主义；还有一种宗教只有外在话语，但不是这样。这就是基督教。这可能是真的，也可能是假的。

我告诉你们。但没有人能提供这种东西：一位救赎者也是先知。一个先知同时也是救赎者，也就是说，他是一个人，而他又是神。因此，他不仅开启我们的心智，还教给我们知识。

那么为什么他会这样做呢？所以这就是他所做的——赐给我们眼睛。其次，为什么要这样做？并且他这样做是因为我们灵里是瞎眼的。

让我们花一点时间来定义这个词语。**我们需要这个原因，就是因为他是灵里瞎眼的。**在第45节中，当他说“开了他们的悟性，使他们能领会圣经”，这里的“开了”很重要。正如你知道的，这原本是用希腊文写的，“开了”这个词是从一个特定的希腊词翻译过来的。

这里有两个不同的希腊词可以使用。一个是noigo（开），另一个是dia noigo（通过……来开）。稍微多了一个字dia（通过）。“开”意味着打开像门这样的东西，已经有开启装置的东西。

所以你用noigo来形容门，但dia noigo不仅仅意味着“开”。它意味着“打破”，意味着“强行打开”。意味着“闯入”。除非是锁着的门，否则不会用dia noigo来形容门。

你会用dia noigo来形容像山这样的东西。我打通了这座山，你看，它意味着“突破”。“开了他们的悟性”用了这两个不同的希腊词。你觉得路加会用哪个？

你随便猜一猜好了。他不会谈论人类的心灵或灵魂像门一样可以打开的东西。他会谈论人类的心灵或灵魂像一座难以穿透的山，层层叠叠的障碍。路加的意思是，直到耶稣开启它之前，自然的人类心灵是灵里瞎眼的。

它是盲目的。那么这又意味着什么呢？你知道，你可以用眼睛本身作为例子来说明这一点。随着年龄的增长，人的眼睛常常会发展出一种叫做白内障的情况。

白内障是一种云雾状或模糊不清、不透明的现象，在本应透明的地方出现。这是一个非常完美的类比，比其他类比都要好，用来解释人类的灵魂。上帝创造了人类灵魂具有透明性。我们不同于动物。

我们不同于植物。我们尊重动物和植物作为上帝创造的一部分。但它们不是按照上帝的形象造的。这意味着什么？

它们没有灵性的能力。它们不具备对真理的认识能力。他们没有理性能力，但也没有真正与耶稣、与神建立个人联系的能力。然而圣经说，由于罪的缘故，灵魂上有一层蒙蔽，必须被打破。

另一种说法是，我们的心灵上有白内障。你知道吗？你尽管揉眼睛，也无法去除白内障。你可以揉啊揉，洗啊洗，但都无法去除，需要医疗干预。

你需要有技能的人来为你手术。耶稣正是这样的人。他不仅是先知，而且是一个具有这种能力的先知。如果你认为只需要真理，说：“我只需要有人告诉我真相就可以了。

”你没有意识到自己有多大的盲点。你不仅需要光，更需要一双眼睛，但你需要有人帮你去除那层蒙蔽。这就是外科医生的作用，这就是医疗干预的作用，这也是你最需要的东西。现在你说，什么是蒙蔽？

它是什么？非常重要，请仔细听。灵性上的盲目并不是缺乏理性。一个完全灵性盲的人完全可以阅读圣经并接受它，说：“我看到耶稣为我的罪死了。

我觉得很好。” 我很喜欢，这很重要，我相信。灵性上盲目并不意味着你不能理解圣经中的某些内容。事实上，当人们成为基督徒时，通常会说：“去年我成了基督徒，但在我生命的任何时候，我都相信基督教的基本教义。

”一个人说他去年才成为基督徒，但他从未在任何时刻不相信复活，这是非常常见的现象。我不相信十字架上的受难。我不相信基督教的基本教义。那么，当人们说自己成了基督徒时，他们到底是什么意思？

这里的意思是，这种模糊并不是理解能力的缺乏，也不是推理能力的缺失。它不是一种理性的无能，也不是某种思维操作的结果。让·皮亚杰（Jean Piaget）讨论了儿童随着年龄增长所发展出的各种思维操作。他提到了感觉运动阶段的发展，共有六个阶段；具体运算和抽象运算等。

他在谈论各种不同的心理能力和操作、逻辑操作和思维交易。当我们谈到灵性上的盲目时，并不是在说这些。灵性上的盲目并不是无法看到真理，而是无法珍惜它、欣赏它。现在这个词语的问题在于，在英语中，“欣赏”这个词听起来比较无力。

比如我们在一首歌里唱道：“主啊，我们感谢你”，每次唱这首歌时都觉得有点无力。实际上，“欣赏”是一个很好的词，接下来我会继续用这个词来说明这种模糊和灵性上的盲目到底是什么。“深刻地欣赏”意味着某物失去了它的价值，因此也失去了经济力量、影响力。比如你拥有一颗钻石，它很有价值。

**这意味着你可以用它做很多事情，可以实现很多目标，因为它有价值。**你拥有这颗钻石，可以用它去很多地方，做很多事情，可以用它换取东西。当某种事物深刻地被欣赏时，它会失去价值；而当某物被简单地“欣赏”时，它的价值会增加。但英语中的“欣赏”这个词还可以表示你对某物的价值、力量或影响的认识增加了。

比如一个人说：“我去年成为基督徒了，尽管我一直理智上相信圣经和基督教信仰，但去年我看到了。” 她具体是什么意思呢？当她说这样的话时，她的意思是： 我一直知道耶稣为我而死，一位新基督徒说，但我从未意识到我需要知道耶稣比我世界上的一切都更爱我。我需要知道这一点，在我心里深处，我以前不相信自己被爱，但有一天，去年，当我意识到耶稣为我所做的一切是我最需要的东西时，这彻底改变了我。

当我看到他为我所做的价值后，我突然明白我不必这样，我不必是这样的。这是所有问题的根源。这种语言意味着眼翳已经脱落了。她看到了，但她没有看清。

你可能知道浪子回头的故事，但这不仅仅是一个放荡的弟弟的故事。实际上，耶稣讲这个故事是为了向那些远离上帝的人和那些试图通过做好事来赚取他爱的人说话。在Tim Keller 的《浪子回头》一书中，他展示了这个广为人知的故事揭示了福音的核心信息——一个对叛逆的弟弟和苛责的哥哥都有希望的信息，并邀请所有人体验上帝无尽慷慨的恩典。无论你是基督徒还是仍在探索信仰，读《浪子回头》都会帮助你以全新的方式看待与基督的关系。

《浪子回头》是你们本月礼物的一部分，旨在帮助福音生活向全世界的人分享基督宽厚而不懈之爱的希望和喜悦。今天就访问gospelonlife.com/give预订你的副本吧。那就是gospelonlife.com/give。现在，请听Dr. Keller 继续今天的教导。

如果你中的一些股票分析师，假设我能送你们回到时光机里，但没有什么比五年前甚至十年前的一次旅行更能吸引一个股票分析师的了，不是吗？就坐下来。你现在回到了过去，坐在《华尔街日报》前，开始阅读股票信息。你和你的股票分析师朋友坐在一起，他们来自自己的时代，并不了解你所知道的未来。

你们列着名单，突然你看到了微软的名字，心想：“天啊，它现在的股价是这样的。”如果我买一千股，七年内我就成了亿万富翁。我会尽一切努力。你看，我要借钱，要恳求，不惜任何代价去买下我能买到的所有股票。

你怎么知道？你知道那些信息的意义。你会发现名单上的一条线特别显眼——微软，为什么？你能理解它的重要性。

你知道它的价值，了解这些信息的意义。没有人能看到那意味着什么，没有人能理解这些信息的分量。没有人知道拥有这些知识会带来多大的不同。他们无法理解，就像瞎子一样看不见。

你有眼睛啊，你看得清清楚楚。那么成为基督徒意味着什么呢？它意味着多年来看的东西突然跳出来，你会问自己：“我怎么没看到它的力量呢？”“我怎么没看到它的意义呢？

”“我怎么没看到它的价值呢？”这就是灵性盲目的含义。我知道房间里有些人会说：“当然我是基督徒，我一直都相信。”但这种经历从未发生在你身上。

你不知道那种体验是什么样的。你是灵性的瞎子。你需要有人来打破你的盲目，让你的眼睛睁开。几年前就有人为我做了这件事。

在我第一个小城镇的教会里，有两位女士来找我咨询，她们几乎是在同一周来的，遇到同样的问题。她们正面临生命中非常沉重的损失。他们找到了一位牧师。实际上，镇上没有咨询师，所以人们那时都来找牧师倾诉问题，因为别无他选。

这些人是在不同的时间来的。在两种情况下，我都拿出了一段圣经经文，并给他们一本书，内容相同，书也一样，主题基本一致。一个月后，我见到了他们俩。其中一个女人回来时说：“你知道吗？

当我开始看到上帝赐给我的和我在耶稣里拥有的东西时，我就意识到，如果我有这些，那么失去这个东西我也能承受。” 我能看出她在恢复中。另一个女人，同样是同龄人，同样的情况，同样的圣经经文，同样的书。她回来时说：“嗯，那确实很好。

”“不过，对我来说有什么用呢？我已经失去了我所失去的东西。” 她无法释怀，从我看来，她的伤痛似乎是永久性的。她们之间的区别在哪里？

是启示的不同，同样的真理，但那个女人能够欣赏这个真理。她能看到这个真理的价值，并感受到它的力量。而另一个女人却没有做到这一点。让我告诉你什么是启示。

你们说：“我希望和平，朋友们，直到上帝的恩典比你周围所有的威胁更真实。” 否则，你将永远无法获得和平，只会忧心忡忡。你们说：“我希望能原谅伤害我的人，直到上帝的宽恕比所有不公都更真实。” 否则，你将永远无法克服你的怨恨。

**这是关于启示的问题，是关于对真理**的欣赏，因为我们都是瞎眼的。只有当我们突破这种盲目的状态时——想要克服罪疚感，真理必须揭示出他为你所做的一切；想要克服忧虑，真理必须展示出他的良善；想要摆脱无聊，真理必须带来新的发现。总之，我们都是瞎子。这就是他所做的：赐给我们眼睛。

为什么要做这件事呢？因为瞎了。最后，他是怎么做到的？我大概要简短一些回答这个问题，虽然我已经在某种程度上回答过你们的问题。

他是怎么做的？他如何处理这种晦涩不明？他如何穿透我们的盲目？答案是相当神秘的，但这里有一个词给我们提供了一点线索。

经文说：“然后他开启了他们的悟性，使他们能明白圣经。”“明白”这个词是希腊文，“Sunet-Me”，字面上的意思是拼凑一个谜题。这就是我能给你的最好线索：如果我把20块拼图随机放在桌子上，你看着它们，但当我把它们拼好放回原位。然后你再看。

有什么不同吗？嗯，你知道的，还是那20块拼图。实际上你看不到任何不同的内容。同样的内容，同样的20个东西。

但是当我把它们拼起来后，你就看到了联系。在我看来，这就是耶稣如何做到这一点的关键原则。这一切都非常神秘。非常长，听我说，如果你在一个穆斯林国家长大，从未听说过基督教，然后来到这里开始听，学习关于基督教的知识，并且你爱上了它，说我想成为基督徒。

那是在同时获得光明和看见。但对我们大多数人来说，情况不同。我们手上有拼图的碎片。我们已经很长时间拥有光明了。

但是成为基督徒意味着，尽管你一直有光明，你现在终于获得了洞察力。尽管你一直有这些碎片，但从没看到它们之间的联系，尤其是与你的联系。当你把20块拼图拼好后，即使它仍然是20块，你也很难再把它看作是单独的20块了，因为联系让你看到了整体。就像你看一本墨迹斑斑的书，有人问你：“你能从中看出什么吗？

”你说：“不，我看不出任何东西。”然后有人说：“哦，那里有一头大象。” ——《马可福音》4:13-15 看看，这里是有主干，这里是尾巴，这里是身体，你说，哦。一旦你看到这些，你就无法忽视它们了。

一旦你看到了联系，就再也看不到各个部分了。同样的内容，没有不同，没有不同的内容，只有联系。因为最接近的解释就是，这就是经文告诉我们的意思，什么是理解某件事的意思。甚至“理解”这个词本身就意味着站在某事之下。

这些门徒看到了真相，但他们从未真正站在那上面。他们看到了各个部分，但从未看到它们之间的联系。这就是它的含义，我恐怕无法说得更清楚了。你看到了联系，看到了各个部分，明白了这一切是如何契合的。

那么让我问你一个问题，就用这个作为测试吧。如果他是这样做的，如果他通过这种方式突破你的盲目，那就是让你连接起来。他会展示这些联系。杰克·米勒曾这样说，他说：真正的基督教主要体现在个人代词上。

然后他又说，总是这么说，他说，一个形式化的基督徒会说：“耶稣为罪而死。” 而一个基督徒则会说：“耶稣为我的罪而死。”“耶稣为我而死。”他为你受苦。

换句话说，一个基督徒看到十字架上的耶稣时，他会感觉到耶稣的血滴落。而一个基督徒则会感觉到耶稣的血追随着你，紧跟着你。形式化的基督徒看着十字架上的耶稣在呻吟，而基督徒则看到耶稣正看着你说：“这一切都是为了你。” 你要坐下来品尝我的肉，让我来服侍你，让我为你死。

让我来爱你。你知道，这就是感觉，个人代词的感觉。我已经在某种程度上回答了这个问题。你怎么知道这是为你的？

如何测试耶稣基督的启示事工是否正在你的生命中运作，从天上的先知性事工来看呢？你怎么知道它发生了？让我给你三个测试：第一个是新鲜感。你所学到的东西总是带有新的感觉。

看见“deonoigo”这个词意味着突破。也就是说，如果你说，我经常和这样的人交流，他们会说：“我一直都是基督徒。”我说，从某种意义上讲，这当然是可能的，可能是你从小就是基督徒。但我要问你的是：有没有那么一个时刻，你看着某件事，突然说：“嗨，我以前从来没有见过这样的事情。

” 我完全被这个真理震撼了，任何真正的基督徒都能理解我的意思。威廉·库珀在他的赞美诗中提到过这种“新意”，他说：“有时，当基督徒唱歌时，会听到一道光。”今天早上，我不知道为什么，在唱第二首赞美诗的时候，我突然听到了耶稣的声音说：“这开始让我感到惊讶了。”你知道这意味着什么吗？

这就是耶稣启示工作的意义。我已经唱过这首歌很多次了。所以我就选择了这首“愚蠢”的歌。你知道的，我通常会选择我喜欢的赞美诗。

我的工作的一个小优点就是我可以选择自己喜欢的赞美诗，我喜欢那首赞美诗，我喜欢它从小调转到大调的方式，有点可爱，也许有些人会认为这是一首有点可爱的赞美诗，但它在小调中找到了解决办法。问题在这里，解决方案在那里，但在这中间，我突然明白了。你知道吗？我在唱的时候听到了耶稣对我说这些话。

你问什么？你是长老会牧师，你怎么能听到声音？不，长老会牧师不会听到声音。如果我们开始听到声音，我们会加入上帝的聚会，但我们不会听到声音，我们属于这个长老会教会。

但这次我确实听到了。因为正如威廉·库珀所说：“有时，当基督徒唱歌时，会听到一道光。”这是太阳带着医治飞临人间。这是一种惊喜，是一种启示，有时候你会觉得这是一次突破。

这种事发生在你身上吗？它曾经发生过在你的身上吗？如果没有，那你还是精神上的瞎子。好的，再一个标记是连接。

另一个标记，当然，启示总是以整个个人的参与为特征，包括心智、意志和情感。你看，在他开启他们的思维时，他们阅读圣经，你注意到发生了什么？他说：“然后他们就归荣耀与神，心里欢喜地回耶路撒冷去了。”为什么他们带着极大的喜乐回到耶路撒冷？

因为祂吩咐他们回去。在第49节中，祂说：“你们回去吧。不要在这里，你们回去，在那里等候，我要把一样事奉告诉你们。” 你看，这里有心智、意志和情感。

不只是心智，不仅仅是他们理解得更透彻了，并不是简单地增长信息量，就像你每周学习计算机程序那样。你读了更多的书，尝试了几种操作，但那都不是一回事。我们谈论的是灵里的理解，它触动到了你的内心深处。有些人会流泪，当他们被感动时，有些人不会流泪。

这并不是说一定要哭泣或不哭泣的问题，而是被感动的问题。他们被告知去做某事，并且现在他们顺服了，回去并且带着极大的喜乐回来。这里有心智、情感和意志。现在我遵照祂的吩咐做。

祂说：“去”，他们就去了；祂说：“回”，他们回来了，但他们带着喜乐回来。整个身心都参与其中，光有精彩的圣经研读，却无法根据神的旨意改变自己的生活，那你就没有真正经历到这种启示。心智、意志和情感是统一的。这是整个人的参与，但最后这个耶稣在你生命中带来启示工作的标记就是它的渐进性。

它总是逐步展开的。彼得后书中有这样一段话：“你们既然预先知道这事，就当谨慎自守，以致得救；也让你们的心灵靠着神大能的力量刚强起来，在圣灵里坚定结实。” 我不确定这具体是什么意思，但它的意思是渐进的。当你第一次睁开眼睛看到真理，并且欣赏它，看到其中的联系以及我们一直在讨论的所有这些事情时，神给你的光是渐进的。

它不是立刻就有的。我指的是它不会立刻达到完全的程度，而是越来越多。你看，你会注意到它就像黑暗中的光芒一样直到有一天你看到黎明升起，心中的明星也升起来了。这就是为什么在第45节，原谅我，其实是第52节，他开启心智去理解圣经，但在第49节他说，我要为你做更多的事。

我要把能力加给你。我会给你更多。所以回到耶路撒冷等待吧。它总是渐进的。

总会有增加。一个真正被光照亮的人会把它看作是一个渐进的过程。你看你得到越来越多，突破越来越多。这就是他所做的事情。

他赋予你眼睛，因为他我们是灵里瞎眼的，所以他通过建立联系和一些方式来判断这些事情是否正在发生在你身上。现在让我简单地总结一下这个应用。你们中的一些人，让我直接说吧。如果这是真的，我把它应用到你们身上。

首先，我会非常简短地说一下，之后我们会下去，有问答环节，有些人可能想在结束前快速询问一些问题，如果你觉得我现在解释得不够详细，可以下来到休息室和我们继续讨论。你们中的一些人没有意识到基督教的整体性。你说我知道该怎么做，但没有力量去做。你说我知道不应该发怒，但我无法控制我的脾气。

我无法控制我的性欲。我对工作的态度过于执着。我无法控制我的情绪。你说我知道什么是正确的，我知道自己应该做什么，但我就是看不到做这件事的力量。

你向神祈求抽象的权力。神不会那样运作。> 看看它的美丽。你说你知道，但你没有能力。

如果你没有能力，你就不会知道。让我向你们展示一下基督徒力量的有机运作方式。我对我的妻子和昆虫有一些了解，现在你们也会明白这一点。如果我看到我的妻子正在读报纸，而她的头发上有一只大蜘蛛爬下来。

我就对凯西说：“凯西，你的左边头发上有只大蜘蛛在爬。” 她回答说：“我知道，亲爱的。” 然后她什么也没做。我说：“亲爱的，你可能没听到我。

你的头发上有只蜘蛛正在往你的脸上爬。” 她说：“我知道，亲爱的，我听到了。” 但她其实没有听到。为什么呢？

因为如果她真的听到了，她会有所反应的，比如“啊，快推开它”。她可能是听了，但只是敷衍地回应了一句。那我该怎么办？我会把她拉到一边。

你们知道吗，这很常见。她是分心了。顺便说一句，当她在读报纸时，她很容易分心。我把报纸往下压，然后说：“你的头上有一只蜘蛛。

” 当她意识到这一点时，她的整个身心——思想、意志和情感——都会被激发起来。现在，这就是上帝赋予力量的方式。很多人会跟我说：“我需要在性方面有自制力。我无法控制我的性欲。

” 好吧，圣经怎么帮助你？圣经从不告诉你，如果你不能控制你的性欲，上帝就会惩罚你。它不会这么说。让我来展示一下圣经是如何说的。

在《哥林多前书》6章中，保罗说：“你们的身体不是自己的；因为你们是重价买来的。” 他说：“所以，要荣耀神。” 看看这句话。秘诀是什么？

不是强迫。不是说你要控制你的性欲，否则上帝会惩罚你。那样不会给你任何力量。人们总是说：“我知道该做什么，但就是做不到。

” 圣经告诉我们，我们的身体是圣灵的殿，因此我们要逃避淫乱。让我再重复一遍： 你们的身体不是自己的；因为你们是重价买来的。所以，要荣耀神。你们的身体不是自己的；因为你们是重价买来的。

所以，要逃避淫乱。保罗怎么说？他说，你们没有。就是这样。

他这样说：看看耶稣为你做了什么。你不是自己的。你是用重价买来的。看看耶稣赐给你的。

你是圣灵的殿。他说，你知道为什么你能控制住性欲吗？不知道吧。这些事。

你们没有。你们没有。知识带来力量。你们是完整的。

神不会把你们分开。不能说：我知道该做什么，只是意志力不够。这太抽象了，**这是斯多葛派的思想，这是异教徒的观念，这是希腊人的想法，这是世俗的想法。你必须知道的是，耶稣基督已经给了我真理**。

如果我让它影响我，如果我看它，如果我说，教导我。用它点燃我的心。你看它，难道不知道吗？难道不知道吗？

你知道得越多，你就越能。你知道得越多，你就越能。这就是如此美丽的地方。你说，我没有力量。

我说，你需要耶稣来引导你的心。他会这样做，并且想要这样做。和人交谈，研究，祈祷，反思，不要放弃。不只是看看这些东西说：哦，我知道了。

要说：我不知道。我应该知道并且会更好地了解它，我会用尽一切可能的方法。我要在其中敬拜，在其中祷告，在其中歌唱。我要与人交谈，并且在这一切中，我要说：主耶稣，请开启圣经，开启我的心灵。

你能做到吗？你会这样做吗？如果你这样做，这就是关键。好了，还有一件事。

你们当中有些人今天是完全和彻底的精神盲者。他说：那些自认为没有问题的人是最精神盲的。那些开始治愈他们灵性盲目的人知道自己看不清楚你。你是谁？

你是哪一种人呢？同一个耶稣基督可以复活拉撒路的灵魂，也可以复活你的灵魂。有人说：我精神上是盲目的。那我该怎么办呢？

很简单。耶稣已经告诉过你们了，我只是再重申一遍。你一说看不见，就在那一秒，你就开始看见了。你意识到自己看不见时，耶稣基督正在帮助你说出这句话，并且你终于回应了他的作为。

所以，当你说出“我看不到”那一刻，你就开始看到了；当你承认自己是瞎子的那一刻，你的瞎眼就开始被医治了。这就是福音的美丽之处，这就是恩典。你们愿意承认这一点吗？还是有人认为这是原始和荒谬的？

我是好人。我是有道德的人。我不需要这些虚伪的东西。我不需要这些戏剧性的东西。

我是尽可能好的人。我是尽可能正直的人。你是瞎子。我拿我的生命担保。

我对这一点比你更有把握，而且我相信这一点就像相信任何事情一样。但你说“我看不见”，而我说“我看见”。你说“我看见”，而我说“我看不见”。这就是福音、基督教的工作方式。

嘿，最后一件事，基督徒朋友们。哦，是的，基督徒朋友们，在这样一个寒冷的日子里，如果你在外面留了一盆水，你不能只破一次冰。你需要不断地破冰。即使耶稣在你成为基督徒之初就治好了你的白内障，也仍然有可能你的视力再次模糊。

这可能还会回来，你就得再去医生那里。同样地，从精神上来说也是如此。你还记得神的话语对你来说是多么明亮的时候吗？还记得上帝的真理对你来说是多么耀眼的时候吗？

让我问你们，这一周还是上周，你有这种感觉吗？除非你不断地破冰，并且不断回到这些真理中，否则光照会增长。**这是一个持续增长的过程。上帝的真理**就像一个巨大的海洋。

我们都是像小孩子一样，在这个令人难以置信的大海边缘划水。我们甚至还没有深入到三英寸深的浪花里。我们才刚刚开始。你们呢？

```markdown 你是否感觉到神在不断地赐给你更深的属灵理解？你觉得像是被引领进入一座越来越宏伟、装饰越加精美、越发壮丽高大的宫殿吗？你是否感受到自己对真理的理解正在增长，甚至都还没有开始？没有什么比自满的基督徒更不合适的了——他们以为自己已经知道了一切。

没有什么比厌倦的基督徒更不合适的了——他们也以为自己已经知道了一切。自满或厌倦仅仅意味着你的双眼又开始变得浑浊。耶稣是光，让我们欢欣地享受他的光吧。他不仅是顾问，更是奇妙的顾问。

我们来祷告。亲爱的天父，求你帮助我们首先看到这一点。我们为此祈祷。求你赐给我们谦卑和坦诚的态度，使我们能够向你的儿子说：我还没有看见，求你再次触摸我。

我还祈求你能帮助我们成为这样的一群人——一个教会和社群，在这里我们宣讲你的儿子的教导，研究他的话语，但总是带着这样的认识：不是我们的聪明才智或伟大的教学能力，而是只有你儿子灵性的光照才能开启我们的心智。赐给我们渴望受膏的心，渴望灵性的工作，同时也有一种务实的决心去掌握真理。求你让我们成为这样的一群人，并成为一个不断有人心智被打开、真理不断突破的地方。感谢你在这样一个地方使这一切成为可能。

求你帮助它成为这样的地方。我们在耶稣的名里祷告。阿们。感谢您今天聆听这段教导。
