## 核心经文 / Key Scripture

> **Hebrews 4:1-12:**
> "Therefore since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it, for we also have had the gospel preached to us, just as they did. But the message they heard was of no value to them, because those who heard did not combine it with faith. Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said, so I declared on oath in my anger, they shall never enter my rest."

> **希伯来书 4:1-12：**
> "所以，既有进入他安息的应许仍然存在，我们就当谨慎，免得你们中间有人被看为是赶不上了。因为有福音传给我们，像传给他们一样；只是所听见的道与他们无益，因为听见的人没有用信心与所听见的道调和。但我们已经信的人得以进入那安息，正如神所说：我在怒中起誓说，他们断不可进入我的安息。"

## 安息：圣经中最重要的主题之一 / Rest: One of the Most Important Themes in the Bible

One of the most important themes in the Bible is the theme of rest. Psalm chapter 3 is one of my favorite chapters. In the psalm it says, "O Lord, how many are my foes, how many there are that rise up against me, but thou, O Lord, art a shield for me. My glory and the lifter of my head. Therefore I lie down and I sleep, and I awake for you sustain me. I will not fear, though tens of thousands would encamp against me."

That's an amazing passage. Here is a man who goes to sleep the night before a battle knowing full well that he's greatly outnumbered, and he sleeps. And he rests. The great question in life is, do you know how to lie down and sleep? Because anybody can lie down, but can you sleep? Can you rest?

圣经中最重要的主题之一，就是"安息"的主题。诗篇第三篇是我最喜欢的篇章之一。在诗篇里说：

> "耶和华啊，我的仇敌何其加增；有许多人起来攻击我。但你——耶和华——是我四围的盾牌，是我的荣耀，又是叫我抬起头来的。因此我躺下睡觉，我醒着，因为你保佑我。我不惧怕，纵有成万的百姓四围安营攻击我。"
> ——诗篇 3:1-6

这段话令人惊叹。这里有一个人，在一场战斗的前一夜入睡；他清清楚楚知道自己寡不敌众，却仍然睡了。并且他安息。**人生最大的一个问题是：你知道怎样躺下并睡着吗？** 因为任何人都能躺下，但你能睡着吗？你能安息吗？

## 安息日的安息：灵魂的深度睡眠 / Sabbath Rest: The REM of the Soul

What is the Sabbath rest? It's the REM of the soul. You know what REM is? Rapid eye movement. Scientists will tell you that the thing that restores the body is not the length of your sleep, it's the depth. It's not how long you're sleeping, but whether you get into those periods of deep sleep.

---

什么是安息日的安息？它是**灵魂的 REM**。你知道 REM 是什么吗？快速眼动。科学家会告诉你，恢复身体的关键不是你睡了多久，而是睡得有多深。不是你睡的时间长短，而是你是否进入那些深度睡眠的阶段。

## 卡夫卡的《审判》：我们内心的焦虑 / Kafka's "The Trial": Our Inner Anxiety

Franz Kafka wrote a novel called The Trial. It's about a man named Joseph K. who wakes up one morning on his 30th birthday and discovers that he has been arrested. He's under house arrest and waiting trial. And they will not tell him what he's arrested for.

Joseph K. falls back on two clichés that many of us use: The world is a rational place, and I am basically a decent person. But these don't work. He begins to look his life over and remembers dishonesties, betrayals, ways that he cut corners. Eventually, he feels more and more anxiety, guilt, and condemnation.

The great minds of the 20th century drive home the same thing: the world is not a rational place, people are not all that decent, and if you look carefully, you'll see that you're not all that decent either.

弗兰茨·卡夫卡写过一部小说，名叫《审判》。讲的是一个叫约瑟夫·K 的人：他在三十岁生日那天早晨醒来，发现自己被逮捕了。他被软禁在家，等待审判。而他们不会告诉他，他是因为什么被捕的。

约瑟夫·K 退回到我们很多人都会用的两个陈词滥调：**世界是理性的地方，而我基本上是个正派的人。** 但这些都行不通。他开始回顾自己的一生，想起自己的不诚实、背叛、以及各种走捷径的做法。最终，他感到越来越多的焦虑、内疚和被定罪的感觉。

二十世纪的伟大思想家反复强调同一件事：世界不是一个理性的地方，人也并没有那么正派；而如果你仔细看看，你会发现你自己也并没有那么正派。

## 罗马书 2 章：那台看不见的录音机 / Romans 2: The Invisible Tape Recorder

Romans chapter 2 says: "You have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else. For whatsoever point you judge another, you are judging yourself because you do the same thing."

Imagine God put an invisible tape recorder around your neck the day of your birth. It only clicks on whenever you tell somebody else how they ought to be. On judgment day, God will say, "I'm going to be very fair. I'm not going to judge you by the Word of God. All I'm going to do is judge you by your own standards."

Nobody will pass that test.

> "你这论断人的，无论你是谁，也无可推诿。因为你在什么事上论断人，就在什么事上定自己的罪；因你这论断人的，自己所行却和别人一样。"
> ——罗马书 2:1

想象一下，上帝在你出生那一天，就在你脖子上挂了一台看不见的录音机。它只有在你告诉别人他们应该怎样做的时候才会"咔哒"一声开始录。

在审判日，神会说："我会非常公正。我不按神的话来审判你；**我只按你自己的标准来审判你。**" 没有人能通过那样的考验。

## 如何进入安息？福音的两部分 / How to Enter the Rest: Two Parts of the Gospel

To enter the rest of God means you have to hear the gospel. Two parts:

1. **Rest from hiding your sin.** There is no peace and rest for the soul unless first there's conviction of sin. The only way for the trial to be over is for you to say, "I'm guilty."

2. **Rest from your works.** Jesus Christ came to live in your place. He came to do everything necessary that you should do. The principle is this: Only Jesus Christ can be a Christian. Only God could really be human. The moment you receive him by faith, you have received the righteousness of Christ instead of working at your own righteousness.

---

进入神的安息，意味着你必须听见福音。有两部分：

#### 1. 不再隐藏你的罪的安息

若没有先对罪有责备与认罪，灵魂就没有平安与安息。审判结束的唯一方式，是你说："**我有罪。**"

#### 2. 不再靠自己的行为的安息

耶稣基督来替你而活。他来成就一切你本该成就的。原则是：**只有耶稣基督才能做一个基督徒；也只有神才能真正成为人。** 你一凭信心领受他，你就领受了基督的义，不再去经营你自己的义。

## 安息的检验：你能坐着听批评吗？ / The Test of Rest: Can You Sit and Listen to Criticism?

When somebody accuses you of something and you're a Christian with rest, you can sit there and listen. If they're right, you say, "You're right." Because deep down you say, "Yes, there's a lot of bad things like that in my life. But God knows it and He accepts me completely, so I don't have to defend myself."

That's rest.

> "Lay your deadly doing down, down at Jesus' feet."

---

当有人指责你什么，而你是一个在安息中的基督徒，你可以坐在那里听。如果他们说得对，你就说："你说得对。"

因为你心里深处知道："是的，我生命里确实有许多那样的败坏；**但神知道这一切，并且完全接纳我，所以我不必为自己辩护。**"

这就是安息。

> "把你那致命的作为放下吧，放下，放在耶稣脚前。站立在他里面，只在他里面，荣耀地完全。"
