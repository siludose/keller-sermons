## 引言与经文诵读 / Introduction and Scripture Reading

Welcome to Gospel in Life. Are you longing to see real change in your life, in your habits, your relationships, your heart? Today, Tim Keller explores how lasting change actually happens in the life of a Christian and why the Gospel offers a radically different process of transformation than anything else.

The Scripture reading tonight is found on page 9 of the bulletin and it's Romans 8, 1-13. There's therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death.

For God has done what the law weakened by the flesh could not do. By sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemns sin in the flesh in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.

To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace. For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law, indeed it cannot. Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.

You however are not in the flesh but in the Spirit. If in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you, anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness.

If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you. So then, brothers, we are deaders, not to the flesh to live according to the flesh. For if you live according to the flesh, you will die.

But if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live. This is God's Word. I think I've said every week that when I first embraced the Christian faith, there was a number of things in my life that profoundly needed changing, but nothing seemed to work until some writers, some Christian writers, took me to Romans 6, 7 and 8, and when I began to understand the teaching of Romans 6, 7 and 8, my life began to change.

And so in this brief series, I'm taking you to Romans 6, 7 and 8. And the question is, how does Christ, how does faith in Christ actually lead to real change in one's life? Today we get to Romans 8 and we see that in Jesus we get three things, quite relevant for the subject, three things we get.

We get a new freedom to know ourselves, let me put it in the second person. We get a new freedom, you get a new freedom to know yourself. You get a new method to change yourself, and you get a new power to be yourself.

欢迎来到生命中的福音。你是否渴望在自己的生活、习惯、关系和心灵中看到**真正的改变？今天，提姆·凯勒将探讨基督徒生活中持久改变是**如何发生的，以及福音为何提供了与任何其他方式截然不同的转化过程。今晚的圣经阅读内容可以在布道单第9页找到，是罗马书8章1-13节。

因此现在在基督耶稣里的就没有定罪了。因为圣灵的律使你们得自由，脱离罪和死的律。神所做的，那软弱的律本不能做成的事，他已成就了。就是神差他的儿子，为我们的罪作了挽回祭，像罪一样，而且是肉体的样式；好在肉体中定罪的条例。

叫律法的要求，在我们这不按着肉体，只按著灵行事的人身上得以应验。因为照著肉体想的，就是死；但照著圣灵想的，乃是生命和平安。因为照著肉体的心思，是与神为敌，因为不服神的律法，也是不能服。那属肉体的人，不能得神的喜悦。

然而你们不是属肉体的，乃是在灵里。若有人没有基督的灵，就不属基督。如果基督在你们心里，虽然身体因罪已经死了，但圣灵却是生命，因为公义的缘故。如果基督的灵住在你们里面，那从死里复活使基督耶稣活过来的，也必借著住在你们里面的圣灵，使你们这些死的人活过来。

所以弟兄们，我们应当把心志坚定在与肉体无关的事上，因为若照著肉体生活，就必定会死亡。但是，如果你靠圣灵除掉肉体的恶行，你就会活过来。这是神的话语。我想我已经每周都说过，在我接受基督教信仰之初，生活中有很多需要改变的地方，但没有什么能真正奏效，直到一些基督徒作家带我来到了罗马书6、7和8章，当我开始理解罗马书6、7和8的教学内容时，我的生活才开始发生变化。

因此，在这个简短的系列中，我要带你来到罗马书6、7和8。问题是：基督的信心如何真正改变一个人的生活？今天我们将来到罗马书8，并看到在耶稣里我们得到了三样东西，这对我们的话题非常相关： 我们得到一种新的自由，来认识自己；用第二人称来说就是：你获得了一种新的自由，来认识你自己。我们得到一种新的方法，来改变自己；我们还获得了成为真正的自己的新力量。

## 认识自己的新自由：不再定罪 / New Freedom to Know Yourself: No Condemnation

You get a new freedom to know, method to change, power to be yourself, point one. New freedom to know yourself, Romans 7, which we looked at last week, right up to verse 1, that is Romans 8, verse 1, right up to verse 22, 23, 24 of the end of chapter 7, is saying this, that in every one of us, there is a dark mass, even the best of us, even the St. Paul's, there's a dark mass of self-absorption, self-concentration, self-centeredness.

And as far worse than any of us want to admit, and it makes us capable of terrible sin and evil. And then immediately after saying that, is Paul saying this is true of you, it's true of me, it's true of all of us, the moment he says that, he turns then to verse 1 of chapter 8. And he says simultaneously, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.

And no condemnation, the word condemnation is Greek word, kata, kreena, which means to have a judgment against, to be condemned or to be guilty means there's something against you that there is, that you're liable for something and you're in a state of astrangement until you pay your debt, let's say to society. But this is saying that though we not only are capable of wrongdoing, but we're doing wrong at the same moment with regard to God, nothing we have ever done brings us into condemnation. With regard to God, there is no liability.

And this word no, therefore now no condemnation. That word no is too strong a word to convey with any one particular English word because it's not a word that means there's now for the moment no condemnation. This word no means, there's no more condemnation for Christians, no longer exists.

It's been destroyed, never again, that's what it's saying. So Romans 7 is just saying we are capable of tremendous evil and immediately says at the same time simultaneously, if you're in Christ, none of that can ever bring you into condemnation with regard to God. Now this is astounding and it's unique.

There's a place in Luke 11 where Jesus is speaking to his disciples and he's actually teaching them about prayer and he says this, Luke 11, he says to his disciples, if you then though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more you're Heavenly Father, you who are evil, no, think about this. He's talking to the people he loves, that he delights in, that he's going to die for, that he's unconditionally committed to, but he's also saying, well, can you hear Jesus saying this to you? I love you.

I will never forsake you. I'm unconditionally committed to you. I delight in you, but you're evil, you know?

Have you heard that? Because if you have, you have something that no, from what I can tell, no system of thought, no philosophy, no religion, east, west, individualistic, collectivistic, liberal, conservative can give you. You know, there's a liberal, a liberal mindset that never calls anyone sinful or evil including yourself because you see all problems are really functions of psychological or sociological dynamics and when you really do something, far more cruel or cowardly or worse than anything you ever thought you were capable of, you've got no category for it, you'll go into denial.

But there's a conservative mindset and there's a conservative mindset who does use the term sinful and evil for people over there and whose very identity is based on the idea that I'm not one of them. I'm one of the virtuous people. I'm not like those relativists, those anarchists, I'm one of the virtuous people.

And when you find yourself, and you will, doing things worse, more cruel, more cowardly than anything you've ever done, you won't have a category for it, you won't know how to deal with it, you will go into denial. But the gospel of Jesus, Jesus attitude, Jesus statement, if you're in Christ, you are simultaneously evil and absolutely loved, gives us a freedom, when you say, well, that's crazy, that's contradictory, yeah, yeah, it's crazy, admittedly, it's really weird. But let me show you how great it is.

第一点，新的自由来认识自己。罗马书7，我们在上周已经看过，直到第8章1节，从第7章23、24节到章节末尾，都在说：在每一个人身上，都有一种黑暗的势力，即使是最好的人，甚至像保罗这样的圣徒，也有自我中心、自我专注和自私自利的一面。这种黑暗势力远比我们愿意承认的要糟糕得多，它使我们有可能犯下可怕的罪恶和邪恶。然后，在说了这些之后，保罗立刻说：这对你来说是真实的，对我来说也是真实的，对我们所有人都是如此。

在他说出这一点的同时，他转向了第8章1节。他说：现在在基督耶稣里的，就没有定罪的了。而且没有定罪，这个“定罪”的词是希腊文的“kata kreena”，意思是判罚、定罪或有罪，意味着对你有所指责，你欠了什么需要偿还，直到还清为止。但这里的意思是虽然我们不仅有能力作恶，同时在神面前也正在犯错，但我们从未做过的事并不会使我们在神面前受定罪。

对于神来说，没有负债。所以这个“没有”这个词，因此现在没有定罪。这个词“没有”不是用一个特定的英文词就能完全传达出来的，因为它不仅仅是指此刻没有定罪。这个词的意思是：对于基督徒而言，再也没有定罪了，已经不存在了，被摧毁了，永不复返。

这就是罗马书7说的：我们有能力做极大的恶事，但同时又说，如果你在基督里，这些都不会使你在神面前受定罪。这真是令人震惊且独一无二的信息。路加福音11章中，耶稣正在向他的门徒们讲解祈祷的事，他说：“你们虽然不好，尚且知道拿好东西给儿女，何况天父是怜恤你们的呢？”他是在爱他们、喜悦他们的人面前说这话的，也是要为他们死的人，无条件地承诺着他们。

但他也在说：你能听到耶稣对你说的话吗？我爱你。我永远不会离弃你。我无条件地承诺你。

我喜悦你，但你是邪恶的，你知道吗？你听说过吗？如果你听说过，那么你拥有的是一种没有的系统思想、哲学或宗教——无论是东方还是西方、个人主义还是集体主义、自由派还是保守派都无法给予你的东西。你知道，在自由派的思想中，从不认为任何人包括你自己是罪恶或邪恶的，因为他们认为所有的问题都是心理或社会动态的结果。

当你真的做了比你想象中更残酷、更懦弱甚至更糟糕的事情时，你找不到一个合适的标签来定义它，你会陷入否认。但是保守派也有自己的想法，并且他们的身份建立在“我不是他们”的基础上——我是那些有美德的人，我不像那些相对主义者或无政府主义者。当你发现自己做了比以往任何时候都更残酷、更懦弱的事情时，你也无法找到一个合适的标签来定义，你不知道如何应对，你会陷入否认。但是耶稣的信息、耶稣的态度和声明，如果你在基督里，你就同时是邪恶的又是绝对被爱的——这给了我们一种自由。

## 既邪恶又绝对被爱 / Simultaneously Evil and Absolutely Loved

Because first of all, it gives you an unmatched, unique, sociological freedom. What I mean by that is, you don't have to divide, you can't, if you understand this, divide the world anymore into the good guys, the bad guys. Some people say there's the good people, then there's the liberals.

Some say there's the good people, then there's the fundamentalists. Everybody's saying there's a good bad, but if you're a Christian, if you have any understanding of this, you know, you know that the difference between you and a prostitute, you and a murderer, you and a Nazi. The only difference between you and them is that the seeds in your heart that make you capable of being or doing that just never got watered, so they never sprouted.

And therefore you have the freedom, in Christ we have the freedom, to find common humanity with people, anybody, we sense our common fragile humanity, we don't write people off, and we don't call the people, those people, the other with capital O, but it's also even more importantly, the gospel gives you psychological freedom, to handle things that you are going to do, and then you won't have to deny or spin them or repress them and make it impossible for you to know who you are, because I don't believe there's any other, only with that support of saying, look, you're capable of terrible things, and I'm absolutely unconditionally committed to you since Jesus. If you've got that kind of support, will you really be able to be honest? Oh, you say, this idea of calling yourself a sinner, that's emotionally unhealthy, you say, oh no, oh no, it's emotionally unhealthy not to be able to call yourself a sinner.

Can I give you an example? One true account that has really affected Kathy and my understanding of this is that years ago, when we were in Virginia, in our area, these aren't people we knew personally, in our area, a terrible thing happened in the late 70s, to a young married couple. They had three children, they were strapped into an automobile, the automobile ended up going in without any drivers in it.

The automobile went into a lake or a pond, and all three children were killed. They're all drowned, horrible tragedy. But at the funeral, the husband and wife, to everyone's surprise, really testified to their faith in God, and they seemed to be so incredibly spiritually strong, that everyone for miles around, were just talking about what incredibly faithful, good Christian people they are, what faith in God, and they did.

They picked themselves up, and they had more children, and they built a new family, and they, of course, were pillars in the church, and the husband was an officer in the church, he was a pillar in the church, 20 years later, we were in another church, and we heard a minister tell a story about a man, and even though he rightly so did not use the man's name, it was very, very clear, it was very obvious to us, this is the same guy, the father. And he talked about the fact that this man had gone through incredible trouble, losing all three children, and he was a pillar of this community, and a pillar of his church, but they had come to the pastor, many years later, in absolute agony, because he had discovered, he had found that he was very strongly sexually attracted to a woman in the church that wasn't his wife, and he had very strong feelings, and a very strong attraction, and he was struggling, and he was an agony, and he was, he experienced horrible guilt, he, the pillar of the church, an officer in the church, how could he feel this way, how could he do this, how could he want this? And the pastor said this story was that he got a lot of counseling, he got good counseling, got professional counseling, he got spiritual counseling, but in the end, he killed himself.

Now, is that just a sad story? Oh, yes, of course it's a sad story, but listen to me. Here's a man who could handle the worst suffering that the world could give to him, but couldn't handle the possibility that he was a sinner.

And are you going to tell me it's emotionally unhealthy to be able to call yourself a sinner? For him, it was the absolute opposite of emotional disc health, unhealthy. To be able to say, I am capable of terrible things, but I'm unconditionally loved, is the epitome of mental health.

And it's the gospel that gives us that. The gospel gives you freedom to admit who you are when the information comes. To see where you do need to change, the freedom to know yourself, point one, point two.

当你觉得这很疯狂、自相矛盾时，确实如此，而且非常奇怪。但让我告诉你它的伟大之处。首先，它赋予了我们无与伦比的独特社会自由。我的意思是说，你不必再将世界划分为好人和坏人。

有些人认为有好人们，然后是自由派；有些人认为有好人们，然后是原教旨主义者。每个人都在划分好人和坏人，但如果你是一个基督徒，并且理解这一点，你知道你和妓女、杀人犯、纳粹之间的区别只是在于你心中的种子没有得到浇灌，所以它们没有发芽。> 你和他们之间唯一的区别就是，使你有可能成为或做那种事情的内在种子从未被灌溉过，因此它们没有发芽。因此，你们在基督里有自由，在基督里你们可以与任何人找到共同的人性，感受到我们脆弱的共同人性，不要轻易否定别人，也不要称呼他们为“那些人”，用大写的“O”。

更重要的是，福音给你们心理上的自由，去处理你们将要做的事情，这样你就不用否认、粉饰或压抑它们，使你无法真正认识自己。我相信没有其他任何东西能提供这样的支持——那就是承认你有能力做可怕的事情，并且耶稣无条件地完全忠于你。如果你有这种支持，你会真的能够坦诚面对吗？你说，称自己为罪人是情感上不健康的，你说，哦不，哦不，不能称自己为罪人是情感上不健康的。

我可以举个例子吗？一个真实的案例对我们理解这一点影响很大。多年前，在弗吉尼亚州我们所在的地区，这对年轻夫妇和他们的三个孩子并不是我们认识的人。1970年代末发生了一件可怕的事情：那辆汽车里没有司机，结果撞进了一个湖或池塘里，三个孩子全部溺水身亡。

在葬礼上，这对夫妻让大家惊讶的是，他们公开表达了对上帝的信仰，并且显得极其精神坚强，周围的人们都在谈论他们是多么虔诚、善良的基督徒，多么相信上帝。他们确实做到了。他们站起来，又生了孩子，重建了一个家庭。他们在教会中是举足轻重的人物，丈夫在教会里担任要职，20年后我们去了另一座教堂，听牧师讲一个男人的故事。

虽然他没有提到这个人的名字，但我们很清楚，这正是那个父亲。牧师提到了这个人经历了巨大的苦难，失去了三个孩子，并且他是社区和教会的支柱，但多年后，他在极度痛苦中找到了牧师，因为他发现自己对教会里一位不是妻子的女人有强烈的性吸引，这种感觉非常强烈，他内心挣扎不已，感到极大的痛苦和羞愧。作为教会的柱石和官员，他无法理解自己为什么会这样想、这样做，为什么会渴望这样的事情。牧师说，这个人接受了大量咨询，包括专业咨询和灵性咨询，但最终还是选择了自杀。

这只是一个悲伤的故事吗？当然，这是一个悲伤的故事，但是请听我说。这个男人能够承受世界上所能给予的最严重的苦难，却无法接受自己是罪人的可能性。你会告诉我，承认自己是罪人的情感状态不健康吗？

对于他来说，恰恰相反，这是情感健康的反面。能够说“我有能力做极其糟糕的事情，但我是无条件被爱的”，这才是心理健康的表现。这就是福音带给我们的。福音赋予我们勇气去承认真实的自我，并在信息到来时坦然面对。

它给予我们改变需要的地方的自由，了解自己的自由，第一点，第二点。

## 改变的新方法：识别肉体 / A New Method for Change: Identifying the Flesh

The second thing we learn here is the gospel gives you a new method for change, a method. Up in verse three, there's another reiteration of one of the themes of Romans seven. It says, for God has done what the law weakened by the flesh could not do.

And remember, we talked about this last week, one of the points that Paul makes in Romans seven is that we've got all this self-centeredness and this self-absorption and this self-concentration. We've got this mass in us that's making our own lives miserable with this self-concentration. It makes our lives miserable people around us.

What are we going to do about it? And what we usually do is we apply willpower and we see the moral law and we say we're going to live up to the moral law. And Paul is pointing out here he's summarizing what he said in Romans seven that that doesn't help you because you know self-centeredness and self-righteousness can take a moral form as well as an immoral form.

You can be a Pharisee as well as a criminal and still make the world a mess of a place. So what are we supposed to do in order to change ourselves? The answer is verse 13, here it is, for if you live according to the flesh, you will die, but if by the Spirit you put the death, the deeds of the body you will live.

If by the Spirit you put the death, the deeds of the body you will live. Now in Romans six and Romans seven, and I'm afraid to prove this exegetically, you'd have to go back to the sermons, I can't recapitulate here, but in Romans six and seven we learn that when Paul talks about the flesh, he's not talking about the physical body. When Paul talks about the deeds of the body or the deeds of the flesh, he's talking about the whole life being controlled by a self-salvation project, that what Paul means by living in the flesh means to be your own Savior, to be your own Lord, to try to instead of letting God be your Savior and Lord, and everything in your life, everything that your body does, everything your whole life does, everything in your life, all your actions and attitudes and everything is controlled by an effort to be your own Savior and Lord.

It's a self-salvation project, that's what it means to live according to the flesh and live in the flesh. And what he's saying in verse 13 is fascinating. He says, if you live according to the flesh, you will die, but if you root out and destroy your particular ways of trying to save yourself, if you root out and destroy your particular ways of doing self-salvation, you will live.

If you just go with the flow, you will die. If you live according to self-salvation project, you will die. But if you root out and identify and destroy your particular ways of doing self-salvation, then and only then will you live, will you say, how does that work?

第二点，我们从这里学到的是福音给你一个新的改变方法。在罗马书七章三节中，又再次重申了罗马书中一个主题。它说："因为神所作的，是律法因软弱人性不能作到的。

” 记得上周我们讨论过这一点，在罗马书七章中保罗提出的一个观点是：我们内心充满了自我中心、自私自利和自我专注。这种自我专注使我们的生活变得痛苦不堪，并且也影响了周围的人。那我们要怎么办呢？通常我们会运用意志力，遵守道德律法，说要活出道德的标准。

但保罗在这里指出，他总结了在罗马书七章中所说的这一点：这并不能帮助你，因为自私和自义也可以以道德的形式出现，而不仅仅是以不道德的形式。你可以是一个法利赛人，也可以是一个罪犯，仍然会把世界搞得一团糟。那么我们该如何改变自己呢？答案在第十三节：“若照着肉体的本性生活，就必死亡；若靠着圣灵治死身体的恶行，必要活着。

” 现在，在罗马书六章和七章中，我恐怕要从经文解释的角度来说，你必须回到之前的讲道中去详细探讨。但简单地说，在罗马书六章和七章中我们学到的是：当保罗提到“肉体”时，并不是指物理的身体；当他提到“身体的恶行”或“肉体的行为”，他指的是整个生命被一个自我救赎项目所控制的状态。保罗所说的“照着肉体生活”是指自己成为自己的救主、主人，而不是让神成为你的救主和主宰，使你生活中的一切——从你身体所做的每一件事到你整个人生的每一个行动和态度——都受控于一个努力成为自己救主和主人的努力。这样的人是活不下去的。

只有当我们靠着圣灵治死身体的恶行时，才能真正地活着。这是一项自我救赎的工程，按照肉体生活和生活在肉体中就是如此。而他在第13节所说的内容非常有趣：他说，如果你按照肉体生活，你就会死亡；但如果你根除并摧毁你那些试图自救的方式——也就是根除并摧毁你的自我救赎方式，你就能活下来。顺其自然，你就死了；按照自我救赎的工程生活，你也死了。

但是，如果你能够识别、消除并摧毁你那些特定的自我救赎方式，那么也只有这样，你才能活下来，才会问：这是怎么回事？

## 什么占据了你的心思意念 / What Preoccupies Your Heart and Mind

What is this new method? At the heart of the new method, verse five and six says, is recognizing and changing what you mind. It hasn't changed what you put your mind on.

Look at verse four and five. It's just another statement of verse 13. He says, for those who live according to the flesh, see, set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things, the Spirit.

To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life, wow, and peace. Now if you must keep this in mind, unpack this. First of all, in the Bible, mind and heart are not two different things.

Yes, in English, in our way of thinking, mind means the reason and the cognition and heart means the emotions, but not in the Bible. Mind and the heart are the core of the being. And therefore, when Paul says, you set your mind on the flesh, he's not just saying, you have bad thoughts.

And he's not even talking only about thoughts. Here's what he's saying. He's asking you to look at yourself and recognize what preoccupies you.

What engrosses you the most. What is your heart most engrossed in? Where are your dreams?

Where do they reside? What has captured your imagination? What most preoccupies and engrosses, the very core of your thinking and your dreaming and your fantasizing and your heart and your mind because, Paul says, whatever that is, is always your way of justifying yourself, your way of proving yourself, your way of developing your own sense of value and worth, and therefore, that's your way of being your own Savior and Lord.

You say, would you please flesh that out, yes. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God, even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365-day devotional, the songs of Jesus, you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight.

If you don't have a regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start, and if you already spend time and study and prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest emotions and questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with Him. We'll send you Tim and Kathy Keller's devotional as our thanks for your gift to help Gospel and Life share the love of Jesus with more people. I've just recently realized, I mean, I just found to my fascination, that when the movie Chariots of Fire in 1981 was made, a true story of two British men, Harold Abrams and Eric Little, who won gold medals for Britain in the 1924 Paris Olympics.

I didn't realize that when that film came out in 1981, Jenny Little, Eric Little's sister was still alive. Eric Little went on to be a missionary in China and died in a detention camp in China during World War II. But Jenny, who's also depicted in the movie, lived through to the place where she had an interview after the movie came out, and one of the things that she said was one thing that bothered her a little bit about the movie was there's only one scene in which is the glimpse of this, and if you know the movie, you know which one it is.

But she says the thing the movie didn't show is that every time, whenever Eric, her brother, who was a world-class runner, sprinter, a hundred-yard dash, and so on, whenever Eric ran, he always ran with his face straight up to the sky and his mouth wide open, looking like a crazy man. He always ran with his face smack up to the sky, facing directly with his mouth open. He looked crazy, he looked eccentric, but he was worshipping.

Because Harold Abrams and Eric Little were both setting their mind on the same thing. They wanted to run, they wanted to win, and they wanted to run and win a race. But for totally different reasons.

---

这个新方法是什么？在第5节和第6节中，它所强调的核心是认识到并改变你的思想。而不是改变你关注的事物。

看看第4节和第5节的内容，它们实际上是对第13节的另一种表述。他说，对于那些按照肉体生活的人来说，他们的心思意念集中在肉体上；但那些按照圣灵生活的人，则将心思意念放在圣灵所引领的事情上。让心思意念停留在肉体是死亡，而让心思意念停留在圣灵则是生命和平安。现在，如果你要记住这一点并深入理解它，首先，在圣经中，“心”和“思”并不是两回事。

虽然在英语中以及我们的思维方式里，“心”意味着情感，“思”意味着理性思考，但在圣经中并非如此。“心”和“思”是人的核心所在。因此，当保罗说要让心思意念停留在肉体上时，并不仅仅是说你有不好的想法；他甚至不仅仅是在谈论思想。他实际上在问你：审视你自己，认识到什么占据着你的思绪？

什么最吸引你的注意力？你的心灵最关注的是什么？你的梦想又在哪里呢？他们居住在哪里？

什么吸引了你的想象？什么占据着你的心思、梦想和幻想，成为你思考的核心，因为保罗说，无论那是什么，都是你用来证明自己、发展自我价值感的方式，因此，这也是你自己救主和主宰的方式。你说，请详细解释一下。是的，《诗篇》可以深刻地影响你对神的态度，甚至耶稣也依靠《诗篇》来面对每一个情况，包括死亡。

在蒂姆和凯瑟琳·基勒的365天灵修读物《耶稣的诗歌》中，你可以找到每天通过《诗篇》的阅读，并获得新的圣经洞见。如果你没有定期灵修的习惯，这本书是一个很好的开始方式；如果你已经花时间研读、祷告，那么通过《诗篇》的阅读和祷告可以帮助你将最深的情感和问题带到神面前，发现与祂更深的亲密关系。作为您对福音与生命事工的支持之感谢，我们将赠送一本蒂姆和凯瑟琳·基勒的灵修读物。我最近才意识到，1981年上映的电影《烈火战车》，讲述的是两位英国运动员哈罗德·阿布斯和埃里克·利特尔的真实故事，在1924年的巴黎奥运会上为英国赢得了金牌。

我不知道1981年这部电影上映时，埃里克·利特尔的妹妹珍妮·利特尔还活着。埃里克·利特尔后来成为中国的一名传教士，并在第二次世界大战期间在中国的一个拘留营中去世。但珍妮也在电影中有出现，在电影上映后她接受了一次采访，她说让她有些不满的是电影中的一个场景，如果你看过这部电影，你就会知道是哪一场。但她提到，电影没有展示的是，每次，每当她的哥哥埃里克——一位世界级的短跑运动员，在百米冲刺时，他总是仰着脸、张大嘴巴，看起来像个疯子一样奔跑。

他总是面朝天空，张开嘴，直接迎风奔跑。他看起来很疯狂，很另类，但其实他在敬拜。因为哈罗德·阿布拉姆斯和埃里克·利特尔都把心放在了同一个目标上：他们想跑，想赢，想赢得比赛。但是原因却完全不同。

## 两位跑者：赞美救主与自我救赎 / Two Runners: Praising the Savior vs. Being Your Own

Because when Harold Abrams is asked, why are you running? He describes the hundred-yard dash and he says, when that gun goes off, I've got ten seconds, he says, quote unquote, to justify my existence. And what he's saying is, only if I can win this race, if I can be an accomplished athlete, and I know I matter, then I can face the world because I've accomplished this thing.

But of course, Eric Little in the movie says to Jenny, Jenny, God made me fast. And when I run, I feel his pleasure. Now listen, here's one guy and he's running to praise his Savior, and here's the other guy who's running to become his own Savior.

They said so. Here's one guy who is running for the sheer joy of it. It's icing on the cake.

If he wins great, if he doesn't win great, because he's already justified. His life is justified. Here's the other guy who's running in grinding anxiety, churning and grinding down, anxiety and fear, because he's seeking to be justified.

He said so. And by the way, as you know, in the movie, even after he wins, he finds it unsatisfying because idols never deliver. Now you begin to understand, to set the mind on the flesh is not just having bad thoughts.

It's essentially to put your mind and your heart on something besides Jesus Christ as functional Savior. And to see how that actually works, let me just give you another kind of example. I remember some years ago, many years ago, counseling two young men at the same time.

因为当哈罗德·阿布拉姆斯被问到为什么跑步时，他会描述百米赛跑，并说："枪响的那一刻，我只有十秒钟的时间来证明我的存在。"他说的是，只有如果我能在这场比赛中获胜，成为一名成功的运动员，我知道自己有价值，然后才能面对这个世界，因为我已经完成了这件事。但当然，在电影里埃里克·利特尔对珍妮说：“上帝让我跑得快。当我跑步时，我感受到他的喜悦。

”现在听好了，这里有一个男人在为赞美救世主而奔跑，另一个男人则在努力成为自己的救世主。他们这么说的。这里还有一个男人是纯粹为了快乐而奔跑。如果他赢了很好，如果没赢也很好，因为他已经得到了证明。

他的生命已经被证明了价值。而另一个男人则是怀着焦虑和恐惧的心情在奔跑，因为他在寻求自我证明。他说过这样的话。顺便说一句，正如你所知道的，在电影里，即使他赢得了比赛，他也觉得不满足，因为偶像永远不会带来满足。

现在你可以理解到，将心思放在肉体上不仅仅是拥有不良的思想。这实际上是把心和意念放在耶稣基督以外的事物上作为功能性的救世主。为了让你更好地理解这一点，让我再给你举一个例子。我记得多年前，曾经同时辅导过两位年轻人。

## 事业偶像：身份根基的崩塌 / The Career Idol: When Identity Foundations Collapse

Both of them had just lost their jobs because their bosses had been pretty stupid and wrong and unfair. Because of an unfair action, the part of their bosses, they both lost their job and they both had a blot on their career record. But Guy A, pretty much got over it, forgave the boss, moved on, and sin was doing so well that he more than compensated for that little blot, it essentially was a non-issue.

The other guy couldn't get past it. He stayed very bitter, stayed incredibly cynical, and it was affecting his career, it was affecting his job, it was affecting his whole future career path. I've ever sit down with that second guy and a lot of people have been trying to help him.

And some people try to work directly on his emotions and the way you work directly on the emotions is you say, oh, you know, you're sympathy and you're talking about how hard it's been and how awful it's been and you're trying to help the person and the problem is the more sympathy that people showed him, the more he felt justified in how angry he was and the more his self-pity grew and grew and he got worse. Other people try to work right on his will. They said, come on, buck up, don't let the bastards get you down, just forgive it, get past it, didn't help either.

Because the gospel, however, is different. For the gospel doesn't work directly on the emotions and say, oh, you know, God loves you in some general way, though he does. And the gospel doesn't direct directly on the will and say, now, you have to do the right thing.

Of course, you do have to do the right thing. But the gospel says, what is functioning in the place of Jesus Christ as your real functional salvation and savior? What are you looking to to justify yourself and see what happened was the one guy cared about his career and the other guy cared about his career.

But the second guy was looking at his career, the way Harold Abrams was looking at running. He had a sense of condemnation and it was through his career that he could prove himself, that he mattered, that he could accomplish something and when something went wrong with it, when something went wrong with the career, he felt absolutely condemned and he was furious and he was paralyzed because of the very foundations of his identity were falling apart. And it wasn't until we were able to do analysis like that.

It wasn't able until he began to understand he had set his mind on the flesh that this was his approach to self-salvation, that he began to say, wait a minute, wait a minute. It's not just, I have to forgive the guy, yes. The reason I can't forgive the guy, it's not just that I have to get back on the horse and work hard.

But the reason I have to, the real problem I have underneath is something besides Jesus Christ is functioning as my savior. And there always is something underneath your inordinate, not a control problems, desires, attitudes, emotions, that's always down there. And until you find it, you can't have life in peace, until you find it, you're going to find things falling apart in your life that's called death.

So first of all, you have the support in the gospel, to be honest about what needs to be changed. Then you've got a method in the gospel to identify what you set your mind on so you can understand where you need to change. And then the third question is, wait, wait.

How does that poor guy now really turn the corner? Here's what was going on. The guy was a professing Christian, oh yeah he was.

But, and he said, look, I technically, I believe that there's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. And technically, I believe that I'm loved, but here's the simple fact, I should be able to say, the king of the universe loves me. Who cares what my boss thinks, but I can't.

Because what my boss thinks is more real to me than what the king of the universe says. That's just, you know, what the boss says is on video, but what the king of the universe says is sort of on audio. I know with my head, but I don't know with my heart, and that's the third thing.

两人刚刚都丢了工作，因为老板太过愚蠢、错误且不公平。由于这次不公正的行为，他们两人都失去了工作，并在职业记录上留下了污点。但A先生很快就释怀了，原谅了老板，继续前进，而他的生活因此变得更好，那个小小的污点几乎成了无关紧要的事。另一个男人却无法释怀。

他一直非常愤恨，极度悲观，这影响了他的职业生涯、工作以及整个人生的未来方向。我曾与这位第二位男士坐下来交谈，很多人都试图帮助他。有些人直接尝试调节他的情绪，他们说：“你知道吗？你很可怜，这件事对你来说太难了，真的很糟糕。

” 他们在努力帮助这个人，但问题是，人们越是同情他，他就越觉得自己有理由如此愤怒，自怜也变得越来越严重，情况反而变得更糟。另一些人则试图直接作用于他的意志力。“来吧，振作起来，不要让那些混蛋得逞，原谅它，放下这件事。” 这也没有帮助。

然而，福音却是不同的。因为福音并不直接调节情绪，说：“你知道吗？上帝以某种一般的方式爱你。” 虽然他是这样做的。

福音也不直接作用于意志力，说：“现在你必须做正确的事。” 当然，你确实需要做正确的事。但福音说的是，在耶稣基督的位置上，什么才是你的真正救赎和拯救者呢？你在寻求什么来证明自己？

一个男人关心他的职业生涯，另一个男人也一样。但第二个家伙则在关注他的事业，就像哈罗德·阿布拉姆斯在关注跑步一样。他有一种谴责感，认为只有通过事业才能证明自己、证明自己的价值，才能有所成就。当事业出了问题时，他会感到彻底的谴责和愤怒，并且变得无法行动，因为他的身份基础正在崩塌。

直到我们能够进行这样的分析。直到他开始理解，他把心思放在了肉体上，这才是他自我救赎的方式。他开始意识到：等等，等等。不只是我必须原谅那个人，是的。

我不能原谅那个人的原因不仅仅是我要重新回到马背上努力工作。而是**真正的问题在于，除了耶稣基督之外，还有其他东西在充当我的救主。而你内心深处总有一些不正当的东西——不是**控制问题，而是欲望、态度和情绪等。直到找到这些，你才能在生活中获得和平；直到找到它们，你的生活就会出现崩溃，这就是所谓的死亡。

首先，福音给你支持去诚实地面对需要改变的地方。然后，福音提供了一种方法来识别你把心思放在了哪里，这样你就能明白自己需要在哪里做出改变。最后一个问题则是：等等，等等。那个可怜的家伙现在要如何转危为安呢？

事情是这样的。这个家伙是一个自称为基督徒的人，没错他是。但他也说，看，从技术上讲，我相信在基督里的人都没有被定罪。而且从技术上讲，我相信我是被爱的，但有一个简单的事实是：我应该能够说，宇宙之王爱着我。

谁在乎我的老板怎么看呢？但我做不到这一点。因为对我来说，老板的看法比宇宙之王的话更真实。你知道的，老板说的话有视频为证，但宇宙之王的话则更像是录音。

我知道道理在头里，却不在心里，这就是第三点。

## 改变的力量：圣灵的职事 / Power to Change: The Ministry of the Holy Spirit

Where do you get the power to really make this change? And the answer is, it's actually in verse 13, but it's also in verse 5 and 6. Verse 13 says, you have to put to death the deeds of the body, you have to destroy and root out your fleshly way of living, your self-savations projects by the spirit.

By the spirit. And up in verse 5 it says, you don't have to take your mind off of the things of the flesh. You have to, you have to destroy the self-savation projects.

How? By minding the things of the spirit. Now what does that mean?

By minding the things of the spirit. See, this is where we move away from a pure technique. Now we're not completely in control here, everybody.

You can't just pick up the Holy Spirit like a scissors or like a screwdriver and start to use the Holy Spirit. But here's what it's saying. What does it mean to mind the things of the spirit?

Don't forget, minding is more than thinking, remember? To mind the things of the spirit means your whole heart, mind, and being are enthralled captivated by something. See, they're all brought together, they're engrossed in, they're preoccupied in, they're captured by something.

Your imagination is captured by something, what? And John chapter 14, 15 and 16, Jesus says, when the Holy Spirit comes, he will take the things that I'm telling you, he will take my teachings and he will manifest them to you. Now this is it.

You may have the teachings, they may be on a piece of paper, you may say it's okay, but the Holy Spirit's job is to make them real to you. It's the Holy Spirit's job to smite you with the beauty of Jesus Christ and what he's done until you weep and the penny begins to drop. And what he says about you is more real than what your boss says about you or what anybody says about you.

There's a great place where John done in one of his sonnet says, and listen carefully, it's really, really amazing language. He's speaking to Jesus and he says, take me to you, imprison me, for I accept you and throw me, never shall be free, nor ever chaste, except you ravish me. I'll never be chaste, I'll never have self control.

What he's really trying to say here is a love of this person or that person will be far more real than the love of you for my soul. And the only way I'm ever going to have self control, the only way I'm going to be able to forgive my boss, the only way I'm going to be able to not worry about money, the only way I'm going to be able to handle the rejection I'm getting in life, the only way I can walk through life at large. See, without it all pulling me down is I need the ministry of the Holy Spirit to make what Jesus Christ has done for me so real that I weep with the beauty of it and the penny drops and I'm off.

That replaces those other things in the core of my being which I'm trying to push there to the center of my being. That's what does it. That's the change.

You say, well, how does that happen? Well, God gives us an idea here. Paul gives an idea in verse three.

It says, for God has done with the law, we can buy the flesh, could not do. Look, by sending his son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemns him. Now, the little word for sin, boy, I know that looks so innocuous on the page, but it's all experts and commentators and scholars understand that that is a technical term all through the Old Testament, the Septuagint, for sin offering.

And here's what it says. It's not enough just to say, oh, you need to just know God loves you in general. You've got to fix your mind on what?

You've got to let the Holy Spirit show you what? How Jesus Christ was condemned in your place. Now Jesus Christ sacrifcially gave himself and was condemned in your place.

And what you're doing, you first study that, you learn that. That's the heart of the gospel. And then you spend the rest of your life letting the Holy Spirit amass radioactive material to work on the tumors of your heart.

See, why do I say tumors? Sin is a tumor, you know, cancer, what is cancer? Cancer is just cell growth gone bad, so it's going to kill you.

And what is sin? It's self-centeredness, self-absorption, self-concentration. It's going to kill you unless you kill it first.

And what is the radioactive isotope that will shrink and kill those tumors before they kill you? It's what Jesus Christ did on the cross, illuminated by the Holy Spirit. Now there's going to be texts.

There's so diverse, there's every person who has grown in grace and has bit by bit been changed, has put the death, the self-salvation of the body, the self-salvation of the soul, and slowly, more and more lived large, lived free, lived loved. Anyone who's been through that, you've got a kind of a secret thread of texts and movies and passages and biblical texts and sermons and things like that. But over the years, the Holy Spirit grabs hold of because of who you are and where you are at the time and turns it into a radioactive material which you can get out the rest of your life and use to shrink those tumors when you know that they're starting to grow back.

You know, Kathy and I have got a, you know, for example, Duncan, at the end of last the Mohicans, the British officer who dies in the fire, arms outstretched, crucify the save a life of Korra. Does that get to you? Maybe not to you.

But it's part of the radioactive materials that the Holy Spirit's given us. First Corinthians 1, God made the foolish things of the world, use the foolish things of the world to shame the wise. He uses the weak things of the world to shame the strong, he uses even the lowly and despised things, even the things that are not to bring to nothing and things that are, so that's kind of moving to me.

Yeah, but for us, this is one of the radioactive parts, this is some of the material that the Holy Spirit is using to destroy the self-salvation. You can find it anywhere. At the end of the Iron Giant, the Great Cartoon, the Iron Giant, he takes a nuke to save the people, and it gets resurrected to some incredible music, you see.

I can't, Kathy and I can't watch that without weeping about Jesus, and you might say, you know, T. But let me really show you how it works.

你从哪里获得真正的力量来实现这个改变呢？答案其实就在第13节，但也包括第5和6节。第13节说："你们要钉死身体的恶行，藉着圣灵将肉身的情欲灭绝净尽。

” 是靠圣灵。而在第5节则说：“不要为肉体打算。”你必须摧毁自以为义的行为。怎么做？

通过思想属灵的事物。那么这到底意味着什么呢？通过思想属灵的事物。这里我们不再只是停留在纯粹的技术层面，每个人都不完全在掌控之中。

你不能像拿起剪刀或螺丝刀那样随意使用圣灵。但这里的意思是：什么是思想属灵事物的含义呢？别忘了，“思想”不仅仅是思考。思想属灵事物意味着你的整个心、脑和身心都被某种东西吸引、被它所俘获。

也就是说，它们都被集中在这个东西上，被它占据着，被它吸引。你的想象力被某种东西所吸引，那是什么呢？在约翰福音14章15节到16节中，耶稣说：“当圣灵降临的时候，他要把我告诉你们的一切事显明给你们。” 这就是关键所在。

你可能拥有这些教导，它们也许写在纸上，你也可以说这没关系。但圣灵的职责是让你真正感受到它们的意义。让圣灵用耶稣基督的美丽和祂所做的事来打动你，直到你流泪，明白这些关于你的真理比老板或任何人对你说的话更真实。约翰在他的十四行诗中曾提到一个伟大的地方，而且你们要仔细听，这段话真是非常惊人。

他是在对耶稣说话，并说：“带我去你那里吧，囚禁我吧，因为我接受你；扔弃我吧，我永不会自由，也永不能自守，除非你使我沉沦。”我永不会自守，我永不能自我克制。他真正想表达的是，这种人或那种人的爱会比你对我的灵魂的爱更加真实。而我唯一能够获得自制力的方式，唯一能够原谅老板的方式，唯一能够不担心金钱的方式，唯一能够应对生活中受到的拒绝的方式，唯一能够顺利走过人生的方式——就是没有这些事情将我拉下水，我需要圣灵的职事，使耶稣基督为我所做的一切如此真实，以至于我会因它的美丽而流泪，一切豁然开朗，然后我就能前进了。

这会取代我内心深处那些想要强行占据中心位置的东西。这就是改变。你说，那要怎么实现呢？保罗在第三节给了我们一个线索。

他说：“因为上帝藉着儿子将律法废掉了，使你们可以凭着爱心行事。”看，那个“罪”字，在页面上看起来似乎很无害，但所有专家、注释家和学者都明白，这个词在整个旧约圣经、七十士译本中都是指赎罪祭。这里说：“光是知道上帝爱你还不够。你必须专注于什么？

” 你必须让圣灵向你展示什么呢？耶稣基督为你受了咒诅。耶稣基督甘愿牺牲自己，在你的代罪里被定罪。你现在要做的是，先研究这个，学习这个。

这就是福音的核心。然后你要用余生让圣灵在你的心中清除那些顽固的肿瘤。看看，我为什么说肿瘤呢？罪就像肿瘤，你知道的，癌症。

什么是癌症？癌症就是细胞生长出了问题，所以会要你的命。那么什么是罪呢？就是自我中心、自私自利、自我专注。

它会让你走向灭亡，除非你先除掉它。那么有什么放射性同位素可以缩小并消灭这些肿瘤，防止它们要了你的命呢？这就是耶稣基督在十字架上所做的事情，被圣灵照亮的。现在会有经文。

这些经文是如此多样，每一个成长在恩典中的人，一点一滴地改变自己，都把身体和灵魂的自我救赎置于死地，慢慢地、越来越多地活出自由、爱与宽广。任何经历过这一切的人，都有这样一条秘密线索——文本、电影片段、圣经经文和讲道等等。但随着时间的推移，圣灵会根据你的身份和你当时的情况，把这些东西转化成放射性材料，让你一生都可以使用它们来缩小那些肿瘤，当你发现它们开始复发时。你知道，凯西和我有一个例子，比如《最后的莫希干人》中的邓肯，在大火中死去，双臂伸展，救了卡拉。

这是否触动了你？也许没有触动你。但这正是圣灵赐给我们的放射性材料之一。哥林多前书1章说，上帝用世人看来愚蠢的东西来羞辱有智慧的人；他用软弱的东西来羞辱强壮的人；甚至用卑贱和被人轻视的东西，甚至是不值一提的东西，来使有价值的东西变得毫无价值。

这对我来说很有感触。是的，但对我们来说，这是放射性材料的一部分，这是圣灵用来摧毁自我救赎的部分。你可以在任何地方找到它。在《铁巨人》这部大卡通片的结尾，铁巨人用核弹拯救了人们，并伴随着一些震撼人心的音乐复活了，你看。

Kathy，我们无法看着那个画面而不流泪思念耶稣。你可能会说：但让我们看看它是如何运作的吧。

## 以喜乐治死罪：十架的放射性材料 / Mortification Through Joy: The Cross as Radioactive Material

At the end of the tale of two cities, Sidney Carton resembles Charles Darnay.

Charles Darnay is in the Bastille, I guess, and he's been sentenced to death, he's condemned, and he's going to be guillotined, right? Sidney Carton breaks in stealthily to the jail. Knox Charles Darnay out, and some of his companions take the unconscious man and unconscious man and steal him out of the jail, and Sidney Carton takes his place, takes his clothes, and waits to die in his place.

And the next day, there's a young girl, a young woman who's also been condemned to die, and she comes up thinking he's Charles Darnay begins to talk, but then realizes it's not sees his face and realizes it's not, and her eyes get really big. And she says, are you dying for him? And he says, yes.

See that begins to shrink my tumors. The old King James Bible, in verse 13, said, you must mortify the deeds of the flesh. You must mortify your false saviors, and you will live.

Of course today, that word mortification just means embarrassed, so we don't use the word anymore. In the old days, it meant to put something in the mortuary, but you know what? When I hear Sidney Carton say, yes, I'm dying for him.

It shrinks my tumors. It mortifies my stupid, egocentric heart that's always worried about what I'm getting here and what I'm getting there. And if somebody is noticing me and might get it, it mortifies with joy.

The joy of what Jesus Christ has done for me, it mortifies my ego into silence, so it's not bothering me as much. And it's not bothering you as much. Are you dying for him?

And he says, yes, for him and his wife. And then she takes hold of his hand and says, stranger, it's going to be hard for me to die. But if I could hold the hand of someone so brave and so courageous and loving as you, I think I can face it.

And he says, all right. She was smitten by the wonder of his substitutionary sacrifice for somebody else. How much more when Holy Spirit shows you what Jesus Christ has done for you?

Will you be able to put the death of things that are putting you to death? Let us pray. Thank you, Father, for giving us a method, a power, and a freedom to really change.

We ask that you would help us now to get some more spiritually radioactive material for the things in our hearts that are harming us and the people around us. We're going to the Lord's table. And we pray that you would be real to us by the power of the Spirit.

To change us into your own image, we ask it in Jesus' name, amen. Thanks for joining us here on The Gospel and Life Podcast. We hope that today's teaching encouraged you to go deeper into God's Word.

在《双城记》的故事结尾，西德尼·卡顿就像查尔斯·丹尼一样。查尔斯·丹尼被关押在巴士底狱，被判死刑，即将被处决。

西德尼·卡顿悄悄潜入监狱，将查尔斯·丹尼和一些同伴一起偷出监狱，自己则代替他穿上衣服，在那里等待死亡。第二天，一位年轻女子也被判处死刑，她以为来的是查尔斯·丹尼。开始说话时，她意识到不是，眼睛瞪得很大，问道：你是为了他而死的吗？他说：是的。

这让我内心的肿瘤缩小了。旧约《钦定本》第13节说：“你们要钉死情欲的行为。”你要钉死你的虚假救主，你才会活下来。当然现在这个词“钉死”只是意味着尴尬，所以我们不再使用这个词了。

在过去的日子里，“钉死”的意思是将某物放入墓地，但你知道吗？当我听到西德尼·卡顿说：是的，我为了他而死时，这让我内心的愚蠢、自我中心的心缩小了，总是担心自己能获得什么。这种对耶稣基督为我所做之事的喜悦，使我自我的骄傲沉默下来，并不再困扰我。它也不会困扰你。

你是为了他而死吗？他说：是的，为了他和他的妻子。然后她握住他的手说：“陌生人，对我来说死很难，但如果我能握住像您这样勇敢、有勇气和爱的人的手，我想我可以面对这一切。” 他说：好的。

她被他为他人代死的奇妙牺牲所打动。当你看到圣灵向你展示耶稣基督为你所做之事时，你会更加感动。```markdown 你能否放下那些正在杀死你的事物？让我们祷告。

感谢你，父亲，赐给我们改变的方法、力量和自由。求你帮助我们现在除去心中那些伤害我们以及周围人的有害事物，使它们变得更有属灵的辐射性。我们将要来到主的桌子前，并祈求你借着圣灵的能力向我们真实显现。愿你将我们变成你的形象，我们在耶稣的名里祈求，阿们。
