## 引言与经文诵读 / Introduction and Scripture Reading

Welcome to Gospel in Life. Why is the world so broken? And why are we capable of inflicting such harm, even toward those we love?

People point to politics, poverty, or psychology, but none of these fully explain what we see in ourselves and in history. This month on the podcast, Tim Keller is teaching from a series exploring the question, what's wrong with us? Knowing us how the Bible's teaching on sin offers the only explanation deep enough to face the truth in all its complexity, and the only hope, powerful enough to transform us.

Jeremiah 21 to 8 and 23 to 32. It's printed there. This is the beginning and the ending of this great chapter in the book of the Prophet, Jeremiah.

The word of the Lord came to me, go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem, I remember the devotion of your youth, how as a bride you loved me, and followed me through the desert through a land not sewn, Israel was holy to the Lord, the first fruits of his harvest, all who devoured her were held guilty, and disaster overtook them, declares the Lord. Under the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob, all you clans of the house of Israel, this is what the Lord says. What fault did your fathers find in me that they strayed so far from me?

They followed worthless idols and became worthless themselves. They did not ask, where is the Lord, who brought us up out of Egypt and led us through the barren wilderness through a land of deserts and rifts, a land of drought and darkness, a land where no one travels and no one lives? I brought you into a fertile land to eat its fruit and rich produce, but you came into a file of my land and made my inheritance detestable.

The priest did not ask where is the Lord, those who deal with the law did not know me, the leaders rebelled against me, and the prophets prophesied by bail following worthless idols. How can you say, I am not the file, I have not run after the bail, see how you behaved in the valley, consider what you have done, you are a swift she camel running here and there, a wild donkey accustomed to the desert, sniffing the wind in her craving, in her heat who can restrain her, any males that pursue her need not tire themselves at mating time they will find her. Do not run until your feet are bare and your throat is dry, but you said, it is no use.

I love foreign gods, I must go after them. As the thief is disgraced when he is caught, so the house of Israel is disgraced, they are kings and their officials, their priests and their prophets. They say to the wood you are my father and to stone you gave me birth, they have turned their backs on me and not their faces yet when they are in trouble they say, come and save us.

Where then are the gods you made for yourselves? Let them come if they can save you, when you are in trouble, for you have as many gods as you have towns, O Judah, why do you bring charges against me, you have all rebelled against me to clear the Lord? In vain I punish your people, they did not respond to correction, your sword has devoured your prophets like a ravening lion.

You of this generation consider the word of the Lord. Have I been a desert to Israel or a land of great darkness? Why do my people say we are free to roam, we will come to you no more, does a maiden forget her jewelry or a bride who are wedding ornaments yet my people have forgotten me, days without number?

This is God's word. One of the reasons why we have trouble talking about sin and evil, even though we need to, where there is things in our past that we feel vaguely guilty for, there is things that we see people doing to us or out in the world and we feel moral outrage toward and yet we have been taught by our society that to use the word sin or evil is oppressive or meaningless, and yet we sense something out there that we don't have the vocabulary for. Now what we are going to do in this series started last week, we are going to go to the Bible because the Bible gives us a far more rich vocabulary for sin, it helps us understand sin in ways that most of us in our society just don't.

It is so much richer, it is so much more nuanced last week, for example, we saw sin is reducing God and the result is smallness of spirit. This week we are going to see that sin is replacing God and the result is addiction of spirit. This is a prophecy from Jeremiah to a nation in spiritual decline and what we see here is he is telling us three things, he is telling us about the dynamics of what we call the dynamics of spiritual attraction, the dynamics of spiritual addiction and the dynamics of spiritual restoration.

I think as we get near the end you are going to see what I mean by what a different, what a different, how this enriches our vocabulary when it comes to thinking of sin and evil and how important that is very practically, but let's get started.

欢迎来到《福音人生》。我们都在与某种形式的成瘾或驱使我们的欲望做斗争。在这个信息中，蒂姆·凯勒探讨圣经对成瘾的看法，以及为什么罪使我们成为奴隶。现在，当我们谈论成瘾时，我们通常谈论毒品或酒精。

我们谈论一个人失去对物质的控制。但我想谈论更广泛的成瘾。

## 成瘾的多种面孔 / The Dynamics of Spiritual Attraction

First of all he shows us the dynamics of spiritual attraction. All through here he is using remarkable sexual imagery.

One verse which I left out, I was trying to say well I can't print the whole chapter but we are looking in a sense of the whole chapter and there is one verse that is very very interesting. See in verse 4-8 which we did print, we are told God is calling them to task for the fact they are turning to idols, they are worshiping other gods, they are not worshiping him. Verses 1-3 he uses, we will get back to this, remarkable sexual imagery of a young married couple just hopelessly in love and in the very end we are going to see, but in verse 20 this is what I didn't print but I should have, in verse 20 there is a verse that starts this way, it goes this way, on every high hill under every spreading chestnut, every spreading tree you, now we say okay that is idol worship because we know that on every high hill they had altars to bail, on under every spreading tree there were altars to bail, why will because altars were a sign of trans, high hills were a sign of transcendence, spreading trees were a sign of fertility, so in verse 20 you see the sentence starts like this, on every high hill and under every spreading tree and you figure the sentence will end, you worship idols, that's not what it says, what it says is on every high hill and under every spreading tree you spread your legs, now I don't know what version you've got out there but I can tell you one thing, whatever English version if you've got a Bible with you you look at it and I know it doesn't say that, whether it's King James or RSV or the new international version or whatever version it is it's not going to say that, but that's what it literally says in the Hebrew, it's interesting, generally speaking, the translators feel that we're just too sensitive or something, to actually hear what God is trying to tell us, what God says is that when you worship idols, when you worship other gods, he says on the top of every hill under every tree you're spreading your legs, now why would he use that kind of imagery, is he just trying to, you know, get our attention, is he just trying to, you know, is this just for shock value, no it's for teaching value because this is what he's teaching all through here, why all the way through the Bible, when God talks about worshiping him, he uses sexual imagery so often and when he talks about worshiping anything else or worshiping any worship is used very often under the umbrella of sexual imagery, why would God do that, here's what he's doing, he is saying that there is an attraction going on at the spiritual level in your heart right now, every bit is powerful as the sexual attraction at the physical level they can happen, in other words, right now he's saying there is something going on in your soul, in the deepest recesses of your soul, you are laying down with something spiritually you're putting yourself in the arms of something spiritually and you relate, your spiritual relationship with that thing is every bit is powerful as a physical relationship is and a sexual one at that, now for a minute think about physical attraction, on the one hand physical attraction is pretty overwhelming, in fact most of us would probably say that most embarrassing moments in our lives and most of you only you yourselves know who these are, most embarrassing moments in our lives where times where a physical attraction kind of overwhelmed are coming since, overwhelmed are wisdom, overwhelmed are conscience but what makes physical attraction so strong is it just emotional infatuation, now here's a place where I'm going to turn to the biologist because actually Jeremiah turns to the biologist, I usually don't, generally I'm not going to go to a biologist and say tell me about the sexual instinct, I don't usually like what I hear, in fact you don't either, most people don't, but it's intriguing, Jeremiah likens us and it's really pretty powerful, likens us to an animal at one point, not just to a bride like in the very beginning of chapter two and at the very end but here in the very middle he says see how you behaved in the valley, he were a swift she camel running here and there a wild donkey a custom to the desert sniffing the wind in her craving in her heat, now here's what the biologists are going to tell you why is the physical desire, why is sexual desire so important and it's this collectively speaking we are dead unless we find somebody else, we cannot reproduce ourselves, this is what the biologists would tell you, the biologists would say that unless you're Godzilla, this is true of every other species, there's something in the male that only the male produces, that has to get together with something in the female produces or else your race is over, your species is over, you're over and therefore the biologists will tell you is a big root of this incredible physical attraction, is collectively speaking male gender or female gender by itself is incomplete and it's dead unless you literally get together, that's certainly obviously there's nothing emotional about animals and yet the physical attraction is incredibly powerful, there's no emotional involvement we can tell, oh where's it come from, it comes from the fact that we are biologically speaking we're incomplete collectively okay, now why this powerful sexual imagery, here's why, this passage, this text is not talking at all about Israel's sexual practices, it's not talking at all about sexual ethics, it's talking about religion, you know it's very interesting down on St.

Mark's place across from Kim's video there's a story it says religious sex and it's very attention getting it's sort of avant-garde and cool to call something religious sex why because in our mind religion and sex are two totally different things they're total opposites so put it together kind of gets to you right that's why they chose it it's St. Mark's place you know we're we're avant-garde we're unusual we're shocking well God beat them to it Jeremiah did this 2500 years ago and here's what they're saying there is deep in your soul a spiritual desire even more powerful than the desires that inform physical attraction and it's this you cannot produce your own meaning in life you cannot by yourself produce your own worth you cannot produce your own security everybody has got to have some meaning in life or else life is empty everybody's got to have some affirmation of your worth or else you feel worthless everybody's got to have some security or you can't face life but you cannot produce it yourself anymore then you can reproduce your own species your own your own your own life you can't reproduce that spirituality whether you can reproduce yourself physically all by yourself you have you can't just say all that matters to me is I like me you're never going to get your worth that way you can't say I'm just going to live for my own happiness you'll never get your meaning that way there's got to be something else besides you that is a source of your meaning the source of your worth the source of your security and you are dry for that you're need for that you need to take hold of whatever that is that's be something or somebody or some some person or some pursuit or some relationship or some goal or some condition or some practice something you are powerless to reproduce to produce in your heart meaning and worth and security as you are physically able to reproduce reproduce your own life and so spiritually speaking if it's not God who's the lover of your soul if it's not God in whose arms you are spiritually if it's not God whose meaning is the source of your meaning whose affirmation is the source of your self-worth and whose power is the source of security if it's not God you're in bed with something spiritually something you've given yourself to in realm so deep and so profound that God here is saying you are as every bit spiritually beholden to it as you are physically beholden you every bit is spiritually laid out as spread out as vulnerable to it physically as you are physically when you're having sex with someone you're doing the very same thing spiritually that you do in bed with someone physically same thing you've got to have this you're spiritually incomplete and therefore you're in bed with something

我想谈论任何东西如何在我们身上获得权力。任何东西都可能成为成瘾。

一个人可以成为性成瘾。一个人可以成为对工作成瘾。一个人可以成为对食物成瘾。一个人可以成为对购物成瘾。

一个人可以成为对权力成瘾。任何东西都可以成为成瘾。现在，什么是成瘾？成瘾是什么时候，一个人无法停止做某事，尽管知道它对他们有害。

成瘾是当一个人需要比平时更多才能获得相同的效果时。成瘾是当一个人失去对某事的控制时。现在，圣经对此有什么要说？圣经说成瘾是罪的工作。

## 罪如何制造奴役 / The Soul's Desperate Need for a Lover

now let's take a minute before we move on can I show you how radically different this view is of soul and of spirit than what you're going to hear about or read about if you go into Barnes and Noble and you go to the section on soul and spirit it it's getting bigger every year there are just tons of book on soul care of the soul and help for the soul and chicken soup for the soul or the spirit you know care for the spirit and if you go in get those books down they're all very very different and yet they're all the same first of all they depict the soul as a pond a sort of still lake but the Bible depicts the soul as a restless turbulent ocean or whenever they talk all these books talk about the cure of the soul or the care of the soul what they usually they talk about getting into quiet places and they think about it and think inspirational thoughts reflect you see be quiet see the soul is is that sort of thing and the Bible says something so much more robust so much more robust so much more vital so much for a lie your soul are your soul is too empty arms your soul is an utterly empty heart and you must run after things in order to fill that I can't help it says the soul I must run after them see completely different approach not only to your soul your soul doesn't just need to be petted there there your soul needs love your soul needs rapture your soul needs passion all right but it's also giving us a completely different view not just of the soul but it's a completely different view of God if you take those books down if they ever do talk about God many of them just don't but if they ever do talk about that God they talk about God in the sense of being someone who sort of gives peace a sort of a remote a power a force and God here says I am not just a remote force in fact I am not just a sovereign you obey let me tell you what I built you for I want to be the lover of your soul I want to be the center of your heart look he's saying at the sex act look at the greatest rapturous bit of sexual love that is just a dim hint of what closure between your soul and my soul will be that's what I've made you for that's what I want you to be with me you know I mean you know there are a lot of people go in and they think this is great this approach to the soul the modern new age spirituality and they just say that and it seems so cool it seems so avant-garde you see it seems so much more it seems much better than the wooden mechanical understanding people have of Christianity but Christianity real Christianity look what we're seeing look what we're talking about this view of the soul this view of God God says I want you my arms power the dynamics of spiritual traction and he says if I'm not if I'm not in your arms if you're not in my arms you're in your arms with something

罪使我们成瘾。罪使我们成为奴隶。现在，这听起来可能很奇怪。但让我解释一下。

圣经说："谁犯罪的人是罪的奴仆。"这是什么意思？**这意味着当我们犯罪时，我们不是自由的。**我们不是独立的。

我们成为我们的罪的奴隶。现在，这如何工作？想象一个人开始吸毒。最初，毒品让他感到好。

毒品让他感到高兴。毒品让他感到放松。但然后，随着时间的推移，他需要更多。他需要更多来获得相同的效果。

他开始成为奴隶毒品。他开始围绕毒品安排他的生活。他失去了控制。现在，这就是罪的工作。

罪开始时很诱人。罪承诺快乐。罪承诺满足。罪承诺自由。

但最终，罪使我们成为奴隶。最终，罪控制我们。最终，我们失去了自由。现在，为什么会这样？

## 罪的谎言与陷阱 / The Dynamics of Spiritual Addiction

now the second thing we learned I'm going to be brief on this because a lot of you know this and what you would rather have you'd like to know I'm pretty good at telling you what's wrong with you and some of you are going to say I've heard this part before I'd like to find out what to do about it so let me be brief the second thing we learn here is also the dynamics of spiritual addiction because what God is saying is if you don't have me in your arms if you if you're in the arms of anything else you're in deep trouble you're actually an addiction cycle let me show you how that cycle runs so briefly first of all the first part of the cycle is you promote something look here in verse 27 they say the word you are my father and a stone you gave me birth and then you say okay you're my father you gave me birth now what is some of you're saying okay what do you mean if you're not worshiping God if he's not the center of your life if he's not the center of your heart if he's not your greatest joy if you don't have that kind of intimacy with him well I'm turning to other gods well what do you mean when you think of idolatry and false gods usually think of sins see now here's where I'm we're trying to enrich your vocabulary is there anything sinful about wood is there anything sinful about stone no false gods idols are not sins they might lead you to sin but they're not sins they are good things they're creative things you see what you have looked at though and you've promoted and you've put them into this top place in your life and what do you say to them you made me you define me you are my father see when you look at somebody and say without you baby what good am I you're saying to something probably very very good you are my father you are my savior you are my maker everywhere we look we see brokenness wars cruelty and heartache we feel it in the world around us and in our own lives how did it get this way and what can be done about it in his brand new book that's releasing this month what is wrong with the world Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer Dr. Keller shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world struggling with your own mistakes or choices or looking for hope and joy what is wrong with the world will help you see how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us this newly released book what is wrong with the world is our thanks for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the good news of Jesus request your copy today at gospel and life.com slash give that's gospel and life.com slash give now here's Dr.

Keller with the rest of today's teaching that's that's the first step the first step is you take something good wood stone something good not a sin and you promote it and you say you are my father you are my maker you are without you I have no definition that's the first thing but then secondly we see that leads to addiction it says you can't be restrained see it says it's very point it's very plaintive here verse 25 do not run until your feet are bearing your throat is dry says the Lord why you run your feet are bare means your shoes have worn through your throat is dry you're dying of throat you're running through the desert of course it's a terrible thing you should never run in the desert that's where this is depicted see and but she says use but you said it's no use I must now that word must is everything anything you have decide see as I said before if God's not the center of your life something is right it might be work in career and job and achievement it might be beauty and love and romance see it might be money and possessions and comfort it might be Adam Smith's invisible hand of the market it might be heggels you know the the world's spirit or it might be baseball it might be football it might be your music I mean you know it it might be your independence it might be some incredibly noble cause somebody that you're some cause you're working for against injustice it could be anything but when you say you define me you're my meaning without you don't have meaning by achieving you you make me feel I've got worth otherwise I have no worth you have to have those things so you are addicted to them you've got to have them and you know the best way to tell whether you're addicted to something is not and this is what the text says not when things are going well but when you're in trouble you see the verse 27 28

---

为什么罪会这样工作？因为罪是一个谎言。罪说"这会使你快乐"，但它没有。罪说"你需要这个"，但你不需要。

罪说"这会给你你想要的"，但它不会。罪是一个捕阱。罪是一个陷阱。罪引诱我们进入，然后它在我们身上锁上大门。

## 正视成瘾的真相 / When Lover Gods Desert Us in Trouble

fastest way to tell is when you're in trouble and see for example let's just say I'm sure this has got to be true some of you let's just say you've got a really close friend and she and you talk to each other a lot I guess I'm thinking of two women friends right now have you ever noticed for example you both went through a career disappointment and she was okay with it and you were kind of devastated but you've also both been through a romance disappointment right similar disappointment and for some strange reason she was more devastated and you were okay what's going on here I'll tell you what's going on here see you're in bed with success you're spiritually sleeping with it that's the reason why when it's taken away from you you can't take it where she is maybe in bed spiritually with with romance you see see we're all in bed with something but the way you can tell is usually when it's taken away I mean here's four people at a restaurant and they're all drinking a glass of wine once in alcoholic how do you find out how do you find out who's the alcoholic how do you find out who's addicted to the wine not by not when they all have the wine that's not the way to tell because you see the people who are not addicted are also drinking the way you tell is is take it away from them take it away and say you can't have anything you see it's the absence of the addictive substance which is really what tells you you're addicted and for most of us the only way we come to realize that we are addicted to lover gods these lover gods that we we have a fail attraction to a lover god to something that we feel like we've got to have is when something goes wrong and you see there's a terrible challenge here and I've thought about this many times you see what god comes and says where then are the gods that you made for yourselves let them come if they can save you when you are in trouble and of course they can't it'll be a real blunt here if you build your life around your your spouse and she builds your life around you you know if you're a man one of you is going to see the other in a coffin someday and here's what god is saying where then will be the gods that you've made for yourself how will they if you build your life on her how can she possibly save you in the moment of greatest need she can't let me give you a very different view but it's really the same what if you built your life on the idea that you are a moral decent person and therefore it is your your moral standards your precious moral standards and your sense that I am a good person is really the thing that gives you your meaning and your worth and what happens when you fall what happens when you lapse what happens when you blow it how can the god of moral integrity save you when you've just blown it do you say that this is the reason why your guilt your guilt it will come down on you where then will the gods be it's when you're in trouble when your heart is breaking that you come to realize the things I built my life on can't possibly save me that's the addiction cycle now lastly there is a remarkable program here of restoration first of all we see the dynamics of spiritual traction the dynamics of spiritual addiction those things which we promote we get addicted to and then those things were addicted to desert us in our time of greatest need see they're worthless and in the end we feel worthless it says in verse five now here's the last point

现在，这对我们的成瘾意味着什么？首先，**这意味着**我们需要看到真相。******我们需要认识到成瘾是可怕的。****我们需要认识到它奴役了我们。**

**我们需要认识到我们无法自救。**许多人在成瘾中，他们想假装没有问题。他们想假装他们可以随时停止。他们想假装他们仍然有控制。

但这是谎言。成瘾是真实的。奴役是真实的。问题是真实的。

**我们需要诚实地面对这一点。****我们需要说："我有一个问题。**我被我的成瘾所奴役。我不能自救。

" 其次，**这意味着**我们需要寻求帮助。****我们无法自救。**我们需要其他人。****我们需要朋友。**

## 寻求帮助与被改变 / The Restoration: Personalize Your View of Sin

how can we avoid the fatal attractions how can we do that how can we keep how can we get out of bed with the lover gods and you know what I'm not being discriminatory here at all I'm gonna speak to Christian friends but let me speak to my let me speak to some solid committed mature Christians whoever you are you know who dares to think I'm talking to you now but anyway you but there are there are some of you out there let me tell you something all of your problems come from this it doesn't matter whether you're strong Christian or we Christian or no Christian at all this is the map of your life your lover gods and whenever you feel an inordinate amount of anger or an inordinate amount of fear or an inordinate amount of guilt or even an inordinate amount of boredom you can always find out why you can always get to the bottom by asking two questions why do I feel like what is there you can say this what is there that I feel like I've just got to have or I'm dead no meaning no worth what is it that I just feel like I've absolutely got to have the second question is what is more what is functioning right now more is my real savior than Jesus Christ I mean that's it's the map of your life now your lover gods now how are you gonna deal with them there's a wonderful program there's three things were told three things still have to be kind of brief but I want you to see them if you want to overcome these fatal attractions if you want to get freedom here's how you do it the first thing is personalized your understanding of sin read verses one to three with me or actually just two and three I remember the Lord says the devotion of your youth how as a bride you loved me and followed me through the desert through a land not soon Israel was holy to the Lord the first fruits of his harvest all who devoured her were held guilty and disaster overtook them now here's what I mean by vocabulary here's the vocabulary issue if you understand sin as only breaking the law of God if that's your basic understanding of sin here's what you're gonna do you're gonna be a scold a scold SCOLD you're gonna scold yourself when you sin and you're gonna scold others when they sin you're breaking the law and there's only thing I know about scolding is this anyone you scold about doing X wants to do more of X than he's ever wanted to do before even yourself you scold your heart and your heart's gonna want to do it more and some of you that's all you've ever done over the years you've got these things you want to overcome you got these things you want to change and all you're ever doing is scolding your heart you're breaking the law of God this changes our vocabulary I should say it enriches vocabulary because here's what the text is telling us sin is breaking the heart of God one of the most vivid ways I can put it is like this some of you have been through what all the counselors will tell you is the ultimate psychological torture the worst thing the most stressful thing that can happen to human being is divorce even you know that right especially when the person that you've given yourself to you've made yourself vulnerable to them rejects you turns away from you maybe even puts him or herself into somebody else's arms now that kind of suffering I think is probably the worst kind of suffering there is but even though we do not want to wish this on anybody that's a terrible thing and I know there's people in this room who've experienced that but you know what we're you know we're learning here that's exactly how God feels if you've been through that kind of marital suffering you get insight into God until you understand that that's how God feels about sin you don't understand sin until you understand look at look at this language this honeymoon language you know at verses two and three he is depicting his relationship to us as two lovebirds in fact it's almost it's almost disrespectful you see because on the one hand he depicts us as a as a young bride who didn't care the fact that she's marrying somebody with no money and they're going to go live in some little hole in the well some it doesn't matter and he's even look at verse three he's depicting himself as a sort of young man and he's just going to deck anybody that even looks cross-eyed at my girl and you look at this and you say these two lovebirds it doesn't matter nothing matters but that they have each other and now why in the world would God use in a sense such an unworthy illustration because that's what his heart is like the Bible is telling us that even though God is utterly holy and utterly majestic and in his being he does not need us we're told that God has voluntarily done the exact the here's the other side of the sexual imagery he's made himself vulnerable to us he cares for us he's bound up his heart with us he in a sense he's given his heart to us and when we live for anything more than God we're doing exactly to him only far more than what people have gone through when their spouses walked out on them you're not just breaking his law you're breaking his heart you're stabbing him in the heart whenever you don't put him in the center because he's put he's put you in the center of his heart do you understand sin like this here's what here's why I want you to know this for some of us the reason we've never really been able to change is because all we ever do is scold our heart but this will melt your heart you have to look you have to look down until you see that what God has done is he's given his heart to us and you know what since he's infinitely more powerful than we are infinitely more loving than we are infinitely more you know wise than we are that must mean he he he suffers infinitely more than we do too I mean I've seen some people I've had some very close friends have been through this this kind of rejection where you've made yourself utterly vulnerable you put yourself in the arms of somebody else and they have rejected you they've gone somewhere they put themselves in the arms of someone else it hasn't happened to me when I see what what other people go through it's devastating even even to care for somebody like that and yet God it says I'm going through something infinitely greater than the worst experience of that and if you've been through that at least you know a little bit about how God sees us he cares for us he loves us until you personalize your view of sin your heart will not be melted the offeratory when you listen to it's about this melt your heart with the personal that with the personalize your understanding of sin secondly

**我们需要教会。****我们需要治疗师。****我们需要社区。**这很困难，因为承认你有一个问题是困难的。

向其他人承认是困难的。但这是必要的。第三，**这意味着**我们需要被改变。****这是最重要的部分。

我们不仅仅需要停止行为。**我们需要被改变。**我们的心需要被改变。圣经说的是不仅仅停止犯罪。

圣经说的是被拯救。圣经说的是被赎回。圣经说的是被变形。当你相信耶稣时，当你被圣灵充满时，改变就开始了。

你开始有力量说不。你开始有力量抵抗诱惑。你开始有力量改变。现在，这不会一夜之间发生。

## 改变的力量与盼望 / Remember Grace and Look in the Mirror

remember grace look at verse 5 and 6 verse 5 says this is what the Lord says what fault did your fathers find in me that they strayed so far from me okay but then verse 6 they did not ask where's the Lord who brought us up out of Egypt let us do the Baron wilderness through a land of desert and rifts a land of drawton darkness a land where the reason they got an idol tree was that they had they had spiritually forgotten their salvation they weren't constantly saying let me remember what he's done for me the second way you can deal with lover gods is you have to spiritually make real what what Jesus has done for you there's a place in Lord of the rings my favorite novel where the hobbit pipin is standing at the gate of the city and in comes the great witch king the demon king and he comes through the gate and he's about to destroy the city and all of a sudden off in the distance horns the horns of the cavalry basically the horns of the the riders of Rohan and they have come and even though the king of Rohan rides to his death that day the city is saved and we're told that for the rest of his life pipin could never hear a horn off in the distance without bursting into tears why because every time he heard a horn in the distance it re it re-awakened the memory of his salvation and the memory of the one who died for him now how do you listen to a distant horns what are your distant horns the sacrament when you take the Lord supper christian friends coming to worship but unless see you get into the arms of lover gods when you stop saying where is the Lord who did this and this and this when you you need to remember grace you need to find ways of making it spiritually real to you you need to find ways of doing that you can't just you can't be passive first five happened because verse six didn't happen so first of all personalize your views and secondly remember grace but then lastly look in the mirror verse 32 this is an amazing verse and Jeremiah couldn't possibly have known what we know about it does a maiden forget her jewelry a brighter wedding ornaments yet my people have forgotten me days without number now what are the what's the function of your wedding dress rides on your wedding day you want to be perfect and the fact of the matter is you're not perfect on the wedding day you want to be just the right size you're not the right size on the wedding day you want to be you know flawless you're not flawless but there's something about wedding ornaments and wedding dresses and the makeup that has never been an imperfect bride and that's the reason why they're so important but one thing I've never seen in all my years of doing weddings I never seen a bride get to the top of the aisle and say I didn't put my makeup on and everybody says oh you're right heck no you know why because your bride's always looking in the mirror I mean all day you're looking in the mirror you're come I mean can you imagine a bride getting to the top of the aisle I forgot to look in my mirror I don't have my veil on or I don't have this third that doesn't happen now God not only says gosh God doesn't just say just as you use your wedding ornaments to hide your physical deformities and make yourself physically perfect looking so I will give you something that will make you spiritually beautiful and spiritually he doesn't say I'll give you something what does he say does a maiden forget her jewelry does a maiden forget her wedding ornaments yet my people have forgotten me now he's saying this here's my promise I can make you spiritually perfect and beautiful the reason you're out there working so dog on hard the reason you're out there so upset the reason you're the reason you want your children to be perfect the reason you want somebody to love you who's perfect the reason you're working so on your crazy you're trying to you're trying to cover yourself you're trying to put their ornaments you're trying to make yourself spiritually beautiful spiritually acceptable and and God actually comes so far and says I'm not just going to give you something that makes you spiritually acceptable I am that I can be that for you and only Jeremiah couldn't have understood but we know and that is that Jesus Christ did not just come and die to make us forgiven Jesus Christ came we're told in Ephesians 5 to present us spotless and radiant a bride he came to be perfect for us he says the John the Baptist the day he's getting baptized John the Baptist says you don't need to be baptized you're not sinful and what does Jesus say he says I have to fulfill righteousness of course he's not doing everything perfect for him he's already perfect he's living a perfect life for us so that when believe in him his beautiful record is put upon us and the reason we're going to love our gods is we're trying to convince ourselves we're beautiful spiritually and God says if you look at yourself in the mirror if you're willing to see what I have done for you if you understand how beautiful you are in my sight because of what my son has done for you you'll be free from your least lover gods forever you know the song that goes like this you see I will arise and go to Jesus he will embrace me in his arms in the arms of my dear Savior oh there are 10,000 charms go learn what that means let's pray thank you Father as we look at this passage for the profound analysis of our souls that it gives us and for the complete program of renovation and restoration it gives us we thank you that it's possible now for us to have our hearts melted by the knowledge of your love for us to have our hearts maintained and and and and changed by the remembrance of your grace for us and most of all to be completely changed by the knowledge of what your son has not just done for us but what your son is for us with Lord these things are very very they're deep they're wonderful if some of us have never heard this before since some people here today have never even heard this understanding of Christianity and we pray Father that that those of us who have heard it many times before that three holy spirit you'll become active in a way that it's never been before and for those of us who have never heard it before that this is just the beginning the first step of a journey and that it will end in your arms now Father give us give us what you want to give us give us yourself we pray this in Jesus name amen thanks for listening to today's teaching it's our prayer that you were encouraged by it and that it helps you apply the gospel to your life and

现在，让我给你一个关于这如何工作的例子。想象一个人与酒精成瘾做斗争。

多年来，他一直在喝酒。他的生活被酒精所摧毁。他的家庭生活被摧毁。他的职业被摧毁。

他的身体健康被摧毁。但然后有一天，他来到教会。他听到关于耶稣的消息。他学到耶稣可以改变他。

他意识到他需要帮助。他向耶稣祷告。他说："上帝，我无法做到这一点。我无法停止。

请帮我。请改变我。" 而上帝做了。上帝给了他力量。

上帝给了他圣灵。上帝改变了他的心。现在，这个人仍然想喝酒。欲望仍然存在。

但他有新的力量。他有新的动机。他有新的希望。他开始说不。

他开始走出酒吧。他开始与其他相信者在一起。他开始建立新生活。现在，他不是完美的。

有时他会失败。有时诱惑会变得强烈。但他不再与之独自作斗争。他有上帝。

他有教会。他有希望。而最终，随着时间的推移，成瘾的力量开始减弱。他变得自由。

他变得被拯救。这是基督能为我们所有人做的。所以，当我们离开这里时，如果你正在与成瘾做斗争，我想告诉你：你不必独自做这个。有帮助。

有希望。上帝关心。上帝想救你。上帝有力量改变你。

所以达出来。寻求帮助。相信耶稣。被改变。
