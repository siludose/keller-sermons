## 经文诵读与引言 / Scripture Reading and Introduction

Welcome to the Gospel Unliked Podcast. Many of the questions we face in life are complex and aren't always answered by simply following rules. Do I speak up now or do I wait?

Should I take that job or say where I am? That's why wisdom is so crucial. But how do we develop it?

Today join us as Tim Keller explores how we apply God's wisdom to the everyday complexities of our lives. As you listen to today's teaching, we invite you to go online to gospelunlife.com and sign up for email updates. When you sign up, you'll receive our quarterly journal and other valuable Gospel-centered resources.

Subscribe today at gospelunlife.com. Today's scripture reading is from the Book of Proverbs 1-9-22-32-33. The Proverbs of Solomon, Son of David, King of Israel, for gaining wisdom and instruction, for understanding words of insight, for receiving instruction in prudent behavior, doing what is right and just and fair, for giving prudence to those who are simple, knowledge and discretion to the young, let the wise listen and add to their learning and let the discerning get guidance.

For understanding Proverbs and parables, the sayings and riddles of the wise, the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. Listen, my son, to your father's instruction and do not forsake your mother's teaching, they are a garland to grace your head and a chain to adorn your neck. How long will you who are simple love your simple ways?

How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge? For the waywardness of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them. But whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease without fear of harm.

The word of the Lord, thanks be to God. So for the first three weeks here after Labor Day, we're going to do a real short series on the very first chapters of the book of Proverbs, which is the number one book in the Bible about wisdom. Now, if you live in New York City, one of the things that you see are choices, they're just zillions and zillions of choices.

One of the reasons for that is that, excuse me, one of the reasons for that is that is a density, you know, in the rest of the country there's 90 people per square mile living. 90 people per square mile living in the rest of America. In Manhattan, there's 60,000 people per square mile.

So if you have expert, and that means more than just more restaurants, it means which is, you know, I don't know where to go to eat, where to go to eat. But you have all these other choices, should I stay in the business I'm in, should I get into a new career, should I stay with this company, should I move into the company, should I go into business for myself, should I go to grad school, where will I work after school, should I marry this person or not, all the deals, all the collaborations, all the partnerships, because it's dense here, there's all these choices to make. And you know what, if you don't make good choices, it can be very destructive.

Bad choices blow up on you. Every choice is like a fork in a road and once you make it, you really can't go back to where you were. And if you make the wrong choice, you never really in a sense can go back.

So what does it take to make good choices, especially in a place like New York to live is to make good choices? What does it take? It takes wisdom, and the book of Proverbs is perhaps the most famous texts in the world.

Millions of people, for thousands of years have looked to it for help and we're going to look for just three weeks at ourselves. Now if we take a look at the very first few verses of the book, we're going to see the basics and what do we have here? What wisdom is, why it's important, why it's a problem, and where to get it, okay?

What wisdom is, why it's important, why it's a problem, and where you can find it.

欢迎来到《福音不受待见播客》。生活中我们面临许多复杂的问题，而不仅仅是遵循规则就能找到答案。现在我该说吗？还是等一等？

我要不要接受那份工作？还是要说出我的位置？这就是为什么智慧如此重要。但我们如何培养这种智慧呢？

今天，请和蒂姆·凯勒一起探索如何将上帝的智慧应用于我们生活中的日常复杂性。在聆听今天的教导时，我们邀请您访问 gospelunlife.com 并订阅电子邮件更新。当您订阅后，您将收到我们的季度期刊和其他宝贵的以福音为中心的资源。今天请订阅 gospelunlife.com。

今天的经文阅读来自《箴言》1-9、22-32、33章。所罗门王（大卫王的儿子）作的箴言，为的是使人获得智慧和训诲，明白言语中的洞察力，接受明智行为的教导，做正义公平的事，给那些单纯的人以谨慎，给年轻人知识与审慎，让聪明人增加他们的学识，让有见识的人得到指导。为了理解这些箴言和比喻、谚语和谜语，敬畏耶和华是智慧之始；但愚昧人轻视智慧和训诲。听啊，我的儿子，听你父亲的教诲，不要丢弃你母亲的教训；它们会像花环一样装饰你的头，像项链一样环绕你的颈项。

你们这些单纯的人，为何还要喜爱自己的简单呢？你们这些嘲弄者，何时才能停止嘲弄？愚昧人又何以厌恶知识？因为放荡的道路将毁灭那些单纯的，自满的愚昧人将自我毁灭。

但凡是听从我的，必安然无恙，在平安中毫无惧怕。上帝的话语，感谢主。所以在劳动节后的第一个三周里，我们将进行一个简短系列节目，探讨《箴言》书的第一章内容，这是圣经中最关于智慧的一本书。如果你住在纽约市，你就会看到无数的选择。

其中一个原因是，其他地区的密度较低，在美国的其他地方，每平方英里居住着90人。而在曼哈顿，这个数字是6万人每平方英里。所以如果你身处一个专业环境，**这意味着不仅仅是更多的餐馆选择，而是你不知道该去哪里吃饭。**但还有许多其他的选择：我是否应该留在当前的职业中？

我是否应该换一份新工作？我是否应该继续为这家公司工作？我是否应该加入这家公司？我是否应该自己创业？

我是否应该去读研究生？毕业后我在哪里工作？我是否应该与这个人结婚？因为这里非常拥挤，所以有太多的选择需要做出。

你知道吗，如果你没有做出好的选择，那可能会非常破坏性。糟糕的选择会反噬你。每一个选择都像是一个分岔路口，一旦做出了决定，你就真的无法回到过去。而如果你做出了错误的决定，从某种意义上来说，你永远也无法回头。

那么，在像纽约这样的地方生活，要如何做出好的选择呢？需要什么呢？那就是智慧，《箴言书》或许是世界上最著名的文本之一。数以百万计的人在几千年的时光里都曾向它寻求帮助。

接下来的三周我们将审视自己。如果我们仔细看看这本书的第一几节，我们会看到基本的内容：这里有什么？什么是智慧？为什么重要？

为什么是一个问题？以及如何获得它？

## 何为智慧：对现实的胜任力 / What Wisdom Is: Competence with Reality

First of all, let's look at what wisdom is. And right off the bat, look at verse 1 and 2, it says, these are the Proverbs of Solomon for gaining wisdom.

But what's the word wisdom mean? Well, one of the best ways to figure out what it means is to look at the synonyms. Look at the other words that are used to describe wisdom right there in those first sentences.

One of the synonyms is the word insight. Do you see this? For gaining wisdom, that's the first part of verse 2.

And for understanding words of insight, what's insight? It's a Hebrew word, the word binaw, and it's a word that actually means to notice differences, to see, find distinctions that other people can't see. Ever notice when a master detective walks into a crime scene, the master detective sees 20 or 30 clues, and everybody else has just got two, but that's insight.

But by the way, insight doesn't just mean noticing 20 things when other people only see one or two. It also means to imagine wisdom in insight means to imagine 20 or 30 things where other people can only imagine one or two. If somebody says, well, I'm in this situation and there's only two things I can do.

And an insightful person says, no, no, you got about 15 things that you could do. And here they are, and breaks it down. So wisdom is insight.

It's the ability to see distinctions where other people can see a blur. Secondly, you have the word prudence. You see that?

This is verse 3 and 4. For receiving instruction in prudent behavior, verse 4, for giving prudence to those who are simple. And the word prudence is, it translates a Hebrew word, that means practical.

It means to know strategic. It means to know how to actually get things done, how to make a goal into reality, not just to talk about it, but to actually bring it into reality. Or another way to say it, wise people are not just characterized by insight, but also by foresight.

They don't just diagnose the problem. They also know how to solve it. And then third, by the way, is the word instruction.

It's, notice it says in verse 2, for gaining wisdom and instruction, it's a kind of strange English word to translate a Hebrew word that means character, depth of character. Now, let's pull them all together. What is wisdom?

One Old Testament scholar, Garhard von Rod, who knew all about the wisdom literature of the Bible said this. Wisdom, according to the Bible, is competence with regard to the realities of life. Competence with regard to how life really works, really works.

So, for example, is wisdom knowledge? Well, wisdom assumes knowledge. If you don't know anything about a subject, you can't be wise about a subject.

So, you can't be wise unless you know, but you can obviously know a lot about a subject and be stupid. Because wisdom is knowing what to do with the knowledge, how to practically use it. Or put it like this.

Is wisdom the same thing as being good and moral, following the rules. Now, according to the Bible, if God made the universe, and He did, so if there's a God who made the universe, and you disobey Him, you're not just being, it's not, to disobey the God who made the universe is not just wrong, it's stupid. I mean, if there's a God who made the universe and you disobey Him, it's not just wrong, it's dumb.

It's not going to work. And so, according to the Bible, wisdom assumes that you're good, assumes that you're following the moral rules. But it is quite possible to be very moral and still be stupid.

And you know why? So, wisdom is not less than being good. It's more, but wisdom is not, it's more than just following the moral rules, you know why?

Wisdom is knowing what the right thing is to do in the 80% of life situations to which the moral rules don't directly apply. Like if somebody comes and says, well, I've got these two jobs, okay, I'm a Christian, I've got these two jobs. What does the Bible tell me?

Well, if I was filled with moral rules, and they're both okay, it wouldn't be a sin to take either job. And yet, if you take the wrong job, it'll be a disaster. So, you see why you can be very moral, you can be following all the moral rules, and it's still not another right thing to do in the 80% of life situations to which the moral rules don't directly apply.

So, wisdom is, you've got to be knowledgeable and you've got to be good to be wise, but you can be both good and wise and still be really dumb. Wisdom is competence with regard to the realities of life, it's competence with regard to how life really works. That's the first point, that's what it is.

Now, he begins to see why it's so important, because down here in verse 32, it says, for the waywardness of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them. Now, that's saying that people without wisdom, the simple and the fools, are not just simply, it's not just unfortunate if you don't have wisdom. It'll kill you.

It'll literally kill you. Why? Well, let's take a look at this for a minute.

首先，让我们来看看什么是智慧。从一开始就来看一下第1和2节："这是所罗门的箴言，是为得智慧。

” 那么“智慧”这个词意味着什么呢？最好的方法之一就是看看同义词。看看那些第一句话中用来描述智慧的其他词汇。其中一个同义词是洞察力。

你看出来了吗？获得智慧，这是第二句的第一部分。而对于理解这些有洞察力的话语，什么是洞察力呢？这是一个希伯来语词汇，binaw，这个词实际上意味着注意到差异，看到别人看不到的区别。

你有没有注意到，当一个顶级侦探走进犯罪现场时，他能看到20或30个线索，而其他人只能看到两三个，这就是洞察力。不过顺便说一句，洞察力不仅仅是注意其他人在看一两个线索的时候自己能看20个或30个。它还意味着想象，在洞察力中想象20个或30个东西，而其他人只能想到一两个。如果有人说：“我处于这种情况，只有两种选择。

” 一个有洞察力的人会说：“不，不，你大约有15种选择。”然后列举出来，并详细说明。所以智慧就是洞察力。它是能够看到别人看不到的区别的能力。

其次，还有一个词是谨慎。你看到了吗？这是第三句和第四句的内容：为了接受明智行为的教导，第四节；给予简单的人以谨慎。这个“谨慎”这个词，它翻译自希伯来语，意思是实际性。

它意味着知道策略，意味着知道如何把事情做到位，如何将目标变成现实，而不仅仅是谈论它，而是真正地将其变为现实。或者说，明智的人不仅体现在洞察力上，还体现在预见能力上。他们不仅能诊断问题，还能知道如何解决问题。第三点是教导这个词。

注意第二句说是为了获得智慧和教导，这是一个奇怪的英语词来翻译一个希伯来语词汇，意思是品格、品格深度。现在让我们把它们综合起来。什么是智慧？一位熟悉《圣经》智慧文学的老 Testament 学者 Garhard von Rod 说过：根据《圣经》，智慧就是对生活现实的胜任力。

是对生活真正如何运作的理解和胜任力。所以，比如说，智慧就是知识吗？不完全是。智慧假设了知识的存在。

如果你对某个主题一无所知，你就不可能在那个领域表现出智慧。因此，除非你知道一些东西，否则你不能表现得有智慧，但显然你可以知道很多关于某个主题的知识却仍然很愚蠢。因为智慧在于如何运用这些知识，在于实际操作中如何使用它们。或者说： 智慧等同于好和道德吗？

或者说，遵循规则就是智慧吗？根据圣经的说法，如果上帝创造了宇宙，而祂确实创造了宇宙，那么如果你违背了祂的命令，你不仅是在做错事，而且是愚蠢的行为。也就是说，如果你违背了创造宇宙的上帝的命令，不仅是错误的，更是愚蠢的。这不会奏效。

因此，根据圣经，智慧假设你是好的，假设你是遵循道德规则的。但显然有可能非常遵守道德规则却仍然很愚蠢。你知道为什么吗？因为智慧不仅仅在于做好事或遵守道德规则。

它更多于这些。为什么呢？智慧在于知道在那些道德规则不直接适用的生活80%的情况下该做什么是正确的。比如，如果有人来找你，说他有两个工作可以选择，他是基督徒，这两个工作都可以做。

圣经怎么说的？如果我只遵循道德规则，而两个工作都符合道德规范，那么选择任何一个都不会犯错。然而，如果你选择了错误的工作，那将会是一场灾难。所以，你可以看到为什么即使非常遵守道德规则，仍然可能在那些道德规则不直接适用的生活80%的情况下做错了事情。

因此，智慧在于你必须既有知识又做好事才能表现出智慧，但即便如此，你也可以既做好事又表现得很聪明却仍然很愚蠢。智慧是对生活现实的胜任力，是对生活如何运作的理解能力。这就是第一个要点，这就是它的定义。现在，他开始明白为什么这一点如此重要。

因为在箴言32节中提到：“因为愚昧的简单人必致自己的死命；愚顽人的喜乐要归于自己。”这表明，没有智慧的人——无论是简单的年轻人还是自以为是的愚人，并不只是缺乏智慧那么简单，它会真正地害了你。它真的会让你丧命。为什么呢？

## 愚昧的两种形态：轻率与自以为是 / The Simple and the Fool: Two Forms of Foolishness

First of all, let's look at these two words, the simple and the fool. Now, these are two Hebrew words, and they're used throughout the book of Proverbs. The simple is a word that means young naive people who are too unruited and unformed to make smart decisions because they're going with a crowd.

And by the way, those of, I got to be careful here, I always put this, this is a particular form of foolishness that young people fall into. What is it? Notice it says, the waywardness of the simple will kill them.

Wayward means to go off the road, and the thing that often really harms us when we're young is we care so much what our friends think. I mean, to be a teenager or young adult, the people that you like to have them think you're not cool, it's the worst thing in the world. And because young people are so incredibly affected by what their friends think, they'll very often go off the road.

They'll be wayward because they're too concerned with what people think. They're too affected by what people think. Instead of doing the wise thing, they'll do the popular thing.

And you're looking back, there are so many choices that people made when they were in this, this simpleton form. You look back on your younger years, you say, why did I ever think that would work? Why did I think I would get away with it?

Why did I think I wouldn't be found out was because I was blinded by the crowd I was with. And so that's one, the waywardness of the simple will kill you. But the other name, the other word, a fool.

This is a Hebrew word that actually means almost the opposite kind of foolishness. Why? Well, the fool is a person who is wise in his own eyes.

That's the characteristic of the fool in the book of problems. And you see a simple fool, you might say, a simpleton, is a young person who is too concerned about what people think. Whereas a fool, according to the book of problems, is somebody who doesn't care enough what other people think.

That is, he's wise in his own eyes. By the way, just because it's so hard to go, he, she, he, she, whenever you talk about fools, you're going to talk about he. But I just want you to know, those of you who art, he's, it could be you.

I just like, it could be you. But anyway, the fool, he's wise in his own eyes and he's sat in his ways. And here's a bunch of synonyms that one old Testament professor put in his commentary.

A fool is self-right, just opinionated, stubborn, hard to persuade, gets his back up when if you try to correct them, and despises his correction. Now, their opposites. The simple ton is a person to conserve what people think.

Whereas the fool is a person who's not concerned enough. They don't, the fools are people who don't listen to what others say, you can't talk to them, they're sat in their ways, they're sure they know. But they're both out of touch with reality.

See, if wisdom is, competence with regard to reality, wisdom does the thing in the situation that fits with reality as God has made it, basically. God made the world in a certain way, it's God's world, it's also a broken world because of sin. And a wise person figures sees the created brokenness of the reality and says, what is the wisest thing to do?

Simpletons aren't in touch with reality, they're in touch with their friends. Fools are not in touch with reality, they're in touch with their own pride, their own dignity, they're sure they know. But what it takes to be wise is to be in touch with reality and fools whether they're too open to what other people say or not open enough are not in touch with reality.

So, for example, here you have a situation, a really difficult situation and you're in it with people and here's the question, should I speak out, should I open my mouth, should I just tell them everything, should I confront or should let it go. Should I let it be, should I not say anything? Now, both of those things are perfectly right.

As we go through the book of Proverbs, you're going to see that there's two Proverbs that are almost back to back. And I think it's in chapter 25 and it goes like this, answer a fool according to his folly, or he'll be wise in his own eyes, like the next verse is, don't answer a fool in his folly, because he'll despise you. So, you read it and you say, okay, which is it eyes?

See, we don't know, Christians do not know how to read the book of Proverbs because we look at the book of Proverbs as if it's a bunch of rules, but it's not a bunch of rules. It's about wisdom, it's about how life actually works and those two Proverbs next to each other are not contradictions. What it's trying to say is, sometimes you ought to confront a fool and sometimes you shouldn't.

And a wise person knows the difference. Now, here's the problem. Almost all of us are not in touch with reality enough to know when to do and when not to.

Why? Point three. Point three is, here's why wisdom is such a problem.

我们来仔细看看这一点。首先，让我们来看看这两个词："简单"和"愚人"。这两个词都是希伯来语，贯穿整本箴言书。这里的“简单”指的是那些年轻而无知的人，他们因为缺乏判断力而容易随波逐流，无法做出明智的决定。

顺便说一句，我在这里要特别小心，这种愚蠢是年轻人最容易陷入的一种形式。那是什么？请注意，它说：“愚昧的简单人必致自己的死命。” “偏邪”意味着偏离正道。

当我们年轻时，真正伤害我们的是我们太在意朋友的看法了。成为青少年或年轻人，如果别人认为你不酷，那是最糟糕的事情。因为年轻人非常容易受到朋友看法的影响，所以他们往往会偏离正确的道路。他们会走错路，因为他们过于担心别人的看法，被他人的意见所左右。

而不是做明智的选择，他们会选择受欢迎的事物。当你回顾过去，你会发现许多年轻时所做的选择是多么愚蠢。你回想起年轻时的想法，会问自己：为什么我当时认为那能行？为什么我认为不会被发现呢？

因为我在人群中受到了蒙蔽。这就是“简单”的偏邪会让你丧命的原因。但另一个名字，“愚人”。这个希伯来词实际上指的是另一种几乎相反的愚蠢。

为什么呢？因为“愚人”是指那些自以为是的人。这就是书中所描述的愚昧人的特征。你看到一个简单的愚昧人，可能会说他是一个轻率的人，即一个过于在意别人看法的年轻人。

而根据《箴言》中的描述，愚昧人则是不够在意别人看法的人。也就是说，他自以为是。顺便说一句，提到愚昧人时，你们总是会用“他”这个词，但我想让你们知道，不论你是谁，都可能是那个自以为是、固执己见的人。愚昧人自以为是，坚持自己的观点，并且一意孤行。

一位旧约圣经教授在他的注释中列出了许多同义词：愚昧人自以为正确，固执己见，难以说服，当别人试图纠正他们时会变得不服气，并且轻视别人的劝诫。而与此相反的是，轻率的人则是那些在意别人看法的人。相比之下，愚昧人不够在意别人的看法。愚昧人不听别人的意见，无法与他们交流，坚持自己的观点，自认为无所不知。

但无论是轻率的人还是愚昧的人，他们都脱离了现实。要知道，智慧就是对现实的适应能力。智慧就是在特定情况下做符合神所创造之现实的事情。神创造了这个世界，在某种程度上来说，这是一个因罪而破碎的世界。

一个有智慧的人会看到这个被破坏的现实，并问自己：在这种情况下最明智的做法是什么？轻率的人脱离了现实，他们只与朋友保持联系；愚昧人也脱离了现实，他们只关注自己的骄傲和尊严，自认为无所不知。但要成为有智慧的人，就需要与现实保持联系。无论是对别人的意见过于开放还是不够开放，愚昧的人都无法真正接触现实。

所以，比如说，你遇到了一个非常棘手的情况，和别人在一起时遇到这种情况，你会问自己：我该不该说出来？我该不该开口？我是不是应该把一切都告诉他们？我应该去质问还是放任不管？

我该不该保持沉默，不说话呢？其实这两种做法都是对的。当我们阅读《箴言》这本书的时候，你会发现其中有两节非常接近的经文。我想是在第25章，内容是这样的：“回答愚昧人要照他的愚妄，免得他自以为有智慧。

”紧接着下一句是：“不可回答愚昧人的话，恐怕你也是和他一样愚妄。” 你看，这两句话似乎矛盾，其实不然。它想表达的是，在某些时候你应该去纠正一个愚昧的人，在另一些时候则不应该。明智的人知道什么时候该做，什么时候不该做。

然而，这里有一个问题：几乎所有的我们都不够了解现实情况，以至于不知道何时该做，何时不该做。

## 智慧为何如此困难：性情与现实 / Why Wisdom Is So Hard: Temperament vs. Reality

Some years ago, I read a really great article in the Atlantic Monthly with an interview with Drom Kagan. Drom Kagan taught for many years at Harvard. He's retired in long retired.

He's still alive, I believe. But he was like the child psychologist of his time, later on that's called developmental psychology, very, very respected, brilliant man. And in the article, he was being interviewed and he said that across 36 cultures now, with thousands and thousands and thousands of people studied.

He says, we now know that I'm paraphrasing it, but paraphrasing it, that neurochemistry creates three basic, habitual reactions to threats. So every one of us, no matter what the culture, there's three different ways that our neurochemistry has wired us to respond to danger or a threat or a problem. He says, some people are wired for what he calls, some are anxious, some are aggressive and some are philosophical.

He says, the anxious people, basically you're wired to instinctively say, let me out of here. When there's a threat, you say, just cut your losses, just get out, just go. He says the aggressive is when there's a problem, you say, let me get in there and deal with it.

You know, I'm gonna get it before it gets me, that's the aggressive part. So he says, anxious people tend to be pessimistic, this is never gonna work, just leave. Aggressive people tend to be optimistic and say, I can handle this, get in there and try to deal with it.

The philosophical are wired to say something like this. Just calm down. Let's not do anything rash.

No use getting bent out of shape. Let's wait and see. Now, Kagan goes on and says, do you realize that we're all wired for one of those responses?

One of those responses feels right. Feels absolutely right. Feels wise to you.

It happens instinctively, it feels like the best thing to do. You do it almost without thinking. But he says, you realize that in most situations, your habitual response is inappropriate.

He says anxious people are best in situations where danger is really high. You know why? Because the only way that you're going to actually survive is without spending a lot of time thinking about it to get out.

So anxious, the anxious response is the best response for highly dangerous situations. And anxious people are the people who are the most functional in that situation. It's as aggressive people are best when it comes to mid-level danger.

If the danger is kind of middle size, sometimes your confidence, I can handle this. He actually sometimes makes pays off, but even if it doesn't pay off, it won't be lethal. He says philosophical types are best in situations that look worse than they are.

If you're in a situation and it's kind of looks dangerous, but actually it's not, the philosophical say, let's slow down, let's stop. And some situations are really not that bad, but if you act evasively like the anxious person or aggressively, you can actually make it worse. And so what Kagan says is you realize that whatever seems the most natural way for you to deal with threats is usually wrong.

In the exact right spot, it's perfect. But in many cases, it's inappropriate and kind of dysfunctional. In some cases, it's absolutely lethal.

Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer? Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith? For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding of what it means to follow Christ.

A great resource to start using this summer is the new city catechism devotional, God's truth for our hearts and minds. This devotional brings the historic catechisms of the Christian Church to life, offering a question to consider for each week of the year. In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catechesis, the rich and communal practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers that frame the foundational beliefs of the Christian faith.

Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer, and a brief meditation that will challenge and inspire you. The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller, and Kevin De Young, as well as historical figures such as Augustine, John Calvin, and Martin Luther. This month, in addition to the new city catechism devotional, we are including a great companion resource, the new city catechism for kids, as our thank you for your gift to help gospel-on-life share the hope of Christ's love with people all over the world.

So request your copies today at gospel-on-life.com-slash-give, that's gospel-on-life.com-slash-give. Now, here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. Now, what does that mean?

And then Jerome Kagan goes on and says this, and this sounds right out of the book of Proverbs. Don't forget he was a child psychologist. He says, for the wise men of all, pardon me, modern, wrong quote, I'll get there.

It's late, and I'm old. From the article, he says, modern parents have been taught that their children need to find themselves and be themselves. But unless parents intervene, their children's natural temperament will dominate them, and they won't learn how to act wisely in situations in which their habitual temperamental response is inappropriate.

Good parenting will see the dark side of their children's temperament, and will intervene showing them that they have to have a greater range of responses. Now, these are all from the article. The point is, the aggressive have to realize you sometimes are to blame.

The anxious have to realize that sometimes you aren't to blame. The philosophical have to realize that sometimes things are really terrible. So what parents need to go to with their children is they need to challenge the anxious to be bold, the bold to be anxious, the pessimistic to have hope and the chronically sunny to worry more.

为什么呢？第三点就是，这就是智慧之所以如此困难的原因之一。几年前，我在《大西洋月刊》上读到一篇非常好的文章，里面有对德罗姆·卡根的采访。

德罗姆·卡根曾多年在哈佛大学任教，现在已经退休了很长时间。他仍然健在，是一位非常有声望、才华横溢的心理学家，在当时被称为儿童心理学家，后来被称为发展心理学家。在这篇文章中，他在接受采访时说，现在已经有36种不同文化的研究，研究对象数以万计的人。他说，虽然我现在是在 paraphrasing，但大致意思是，神经化学反应会创造出三种基本的、习惯性的应对威胁的方式。

无论我们处于什么文化背景中，我们的神经化学反应都会以三种不同的方式让我们应对危险或问题。他说，有些人天生焦虑，有些人生性好斗，还有一些人则比较哲学化。他解释说，对于那些焦虑的人而言，当有威胁出现时，他们本能地会想：赶紧离开这里。他们会说：“快点止损，赶快走吧。

” 而对于好斗的人来说，当有问题发生时，他们的反应是：我要冲上去解决它。他们会说：“我先下手为强。”所以他说，焦虑的人通常比较悲观，认为“这永远不可能成功，还是放弃吧”。而好斗的人则比较乐观，会说：“我能搞定这个问题，让我来处理。

” 至于那些哲学化的人，则倾向于说：“冷静点。让我们不要做任何冲动的事情。” 别急着大动干戈。让我们先观察一下再说。

然后 Kagan 继续说道：你有没有意识到我们每个人都是按照这三种反应之一进行编程的？某种反应对你来说感觉就是对的，感觉是最明智的选择。这种反应会本能地发生，并且你会觉得这是最好的做法，几乎不需要思考就能做出反应。但他指出，在大多数情况下，你的习惯性应对方式是不合适的。

他说，焦虑的人最适合在高危情况中发挥作用。为什么呢？因为在这种情况下，你唯一能做的就是迅速逃离，而不是花太多时间去思考和分析。所以，焦虑的反应在高度危险的情况下是最有效的，而焦虑的人也是在这种情况下表现得最有效率。

至于好斗的人，则更适合处理中等程度的威胁。如果危险是中等大小，有时候你的自信“我能搞定”确实会奏效，但即使不奏效也不会致命。他说，哲学化的人最适合那些看起来比实际情况更糟的情况。（原文中的 markdown 格式已保留） 如果情况看似危险，但实际上并非如此，哲学家们会说，让我们冷静下来，停下来。

有些情况其实并没有那么糟糕，但如果你像焦虑的人那样回避问题或采取攻击性的方式应对，反而可能使情况变得更糟。正如Kagan所说，你意识到自己最自然的应对威胁方式通常是错误的。在正确的位置上，一切都很完美。但在很多情况下，这并不合适，甚至有些时候是功能失调的。

在某些情况下，它可能是致命的。这个夏天你在寻找信仰成长的方法吗？还是希望帮助新信徒或孩子理解基督教的核心信仰？对于很多人来说，夏季可以提供更多的机会来深化我们的信仰和对跟随基督意义的理解。

一个很好的资源是在这个夏天开始使用的“城市 catechism 日课”，这本日课将基督教历史上的 catechisms 带入生活，为一年中的每个星期提供一个问题供你思考。在引言中，Tim Keller 阐述了 catechesis 的重要性——这一丰富而集体的学习和记忆问答的实践，它们构成了基督教信仰的基本信念框架。每周包括一段经文、一个祷告和一篇简短的沉思，这些内容将挑战并激励你。附带的评论由当代牧者如约翰·派博、提摩太·凯勒、凯文·德扬以及历史人物如奥古斯丁、约翰·加尔文和马丁·路德撰写。

本月，除了“城市 catechism 日课”，我们还将提供一个很好的配套资源——“城市 catechism 给孩子们”，作为您对帮助福音生活分享基督之爱的礼物表示感谢的方式。所以，请访问 gospel-on-life.com/give 今天订购您的副本。现在，提摩太·凯勒将继续今天的教导。那么这又意味着什么呢？

然后杰罗姆·卡根接着说，这听起来就像是箴言书里的内容。别忘了他是个儿童心理学家，他说，对于所有的智者来说，不，错了，现代的错误引用，我马上纠正。现在已经是深夜了，我也老了。从文章中，他说，现代父母被告知要让孩子找到自我并成为真正的自己。

但如果家长不干预，孩子的自然性格会主导他们，而他们将无法学会在那些习惯性反应不合适的情况下如何明智地行事。良好的育儿需要看到孩子性格中的阴暗面，并介入教导他们必须有更广泛的应对方式。这些都是文章里的内容。重点是，好斗的人要意识到有时你也是有责任的。

焦虑的人要意识到有时你并不是唯一有责任的那个。悲观的人要认识到有时候事情真的很糟糕。所以父母需要与他们的孩子一起做的是：挑战焦虑的孩子变得勇敢，挑战勇敢的孩子变得焦虑，挑战悲观的孩子保持希望，挑战总是阳光明媚的孩子多担忧一些。

## 愚蠢是天性，智慧靠习得 / Foolishness Is Natural, Wisdom Is Acquired

Now, Proverbs, I told you this head at this point, I'm trying to show you why wisdom is such a problem. Proverbs chapter 22 verse 15 says, foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child. You know what that means?

We're all naturally foolish. Jerome Kagan says so. The way we're wired automatically makes us respond in habitual ways that are often inappropriate.

They're out of touch with reality. They're in touch with our temperament. They're in touch with our opinion.

They're in touch with what the crowd says, but they're not in touch with reality. And fools are people that are not in touch with reality. And Kagan says foolishness is natural.

Wisdom is acquired. If you're just yourself, you're going to be a fool. If your parents just let you be yourself, you're going to be a fool.

If your friends just let yourself be yourself, you're going to be a fool. And if you let yourself be yourself, you're going to be a fool. You see the problem it is?

And he's also right in saying that unless somebody, listen, unless you learn wisdom, which takes years, it takes years of training, it takes years of humbling yourself, it takes years of not being wise in your own eyes, it takes years of being corrected by people and receiving correction. It takes years of being mentored, it takes years of being trained, of learning. We're going to see all this by the way in the next couple of weeks.

Years of getting to know the Word of God, getting to know God, getting to know your own heart, it takes years and years of pushing yourself out beyond your comfort zone, pushing yourself out beyond your natural temperament, pushing yourself out, it takes years to develop and if you don't, you're going to be killed, you're going to be destroyed, you're going to make bad choices and they're going to blow up on you. And also, Kagan's right, when he says, is our culture. The culture is completely against us, the culture says you need to be yourself, the idea that you're supposed to fight against your temperament and not try to be yourself and to learn wisdom, oh no.

What the culture says is be yourself and if you've got a problem, find a technique. Now let me get to the, you see as Lewis has a quote from his book, The Abolition of Man, which I just tried to read to you a minute ago. And Lewis says, if you want to summarize the difference between modern times and ancient times, listen.

He says, for the wise men of old, the cardinal problem had been how to conform the sold reality and the solution was knowledge, self-discipline, and virtue. He says, that's the ancient way. The ancient way is our problem is that we are not conform to reality.

How do we conform the sold reality? And the answer is virtue and wisdom and change, change yourself. But today, he says, the problem is how to subdue reality to our wishes.

That's what modern people want and the solution is a technique. So for example, plenty of Christians who consider themselves not being influenced by their culture but being influenced by the Bible are more influenced by their culture in this area than they think. And I'll give you an example.

Over the years, I've had people so often come to me and say, I've got a big question. I've got a choice to make. I have to choose this or this or I have to choose from this or this.

And I wanted to discern God's will. I want to know what God's will is. Well, that's very spiritual.

It is. It's right. I only want to do what God wants me to do, okay?

So I would like to know, when you pray, how can you tell which of the options God wants? In other words, is there a way to pray so that I can sense God showing me? So when I pray about this or this or this or this, do I, and I feel more peace when I'm praying about this rather than this, is that God telling me, I mean, how do I discern God guiding me to show me what I should do?

And my response to them is virtually never a very satisfying response to them at first. I hope later maybe it is. Because I always say, look, prayer is a very big part of what it means to become a wise person.

We'll talk about that again in the next couple of weeks. But I said, you know, you need it. As far as the Bible is concerned, here's how you discern God's will.

You become a wise person through years of training, through learning, through getting to know God, getting to know the Word, getting to know your own heart, getting going through suffering, being corrected by people. You slowly, slowly, slowly become a discerning, insightful, prudent, wise person. And then, when you've got a choice to make, choose the option that you think is best.

Because when you come into me and say, well, I want to learn how in prayer I can sort of lay things out in front of God and find out what God wants. That's a technique. That sounds very spiritual.

Oh, I just want to know what God wants. In other words, it sounds very spiritual. It's a technique.

You're doing exactly what your culture wants. Not to conform the soul to reality, but to conform the reality of the soul. Not you make the change, but you find a technique that when you get into a situation, no, actually, I haven't spent years praying.

I haven't spent years being learning correction. I haven't had years of experience. I haven't had these things.

This is a technique. Do you see the problem we've got? This is what wisdom is, being in touch with, competent with regard to realities of life.

The real problem is that we're all fools by nature. And if we don't learn the wisdom to make good choices, it's going to destroy us. So, how do we find that wisdom?

Now, all we can do at this point is point to the next couple of weeks, one verse here that tells us how to begin the search. How do you find this wisdom? Here's how it begins.

It's right there. In fact, that's the word. Look at verse seven.

This is one of the most famous verses in the Bible because it's repeated over and over again. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. Okay.

现在，我已经提到这一点了，我想向你们展示为什么智慧是一个问题。

箴言书22章15节说："愚昧之念藏在孩童心中。"你知道**这意味着什么吗？我们本性都是愚蠢的。**杰罗姆·卡根这么说。

我们的大脑天生会让我们以习惯性的、往往不合适的方式做出反应。这些反应与现实脱节，而是与我们的性格和意见相连。它们与大众的看法有关，但不是与现实相连。愚昧的人就是那些不与现实相连的人。

卡根说愚蠢是自然的。智慧则是通过学习获得的。如果你只是做自己，你就是一个傻瓜。如果父母让你自由发展，你就会成为一个傻瓜。

如果朋友让你自由发展，你也会成为一个傻瓜。如果你任由自己发展，你也只是一个傻瓜。你看出了问题了吗？他确实说得很对，除非有人听进去，除非你学会智慧，这需要多年的时间，需要多年的训练，需要不断地谦卑自己，需要多年不以自我为中心，需要接受别人的纠正和指导。

需要多年的学习与导师的引导，需要多年的磨练。我们接下来几周就会看到这一切。了解圣经、认识神、认识自己的内心，这需要年复一年地超越舒适区，超越自然的性格，这需要多年的时间去培养和发展，否则你将会被毁掉，做出错误的选择，这些选择最终会反噬自己。而且，加根说的也很对，我们的文化完全反对这一点，文化认为你应该做你自己，而不要试图改变你的性格和气质，也不要学习智慧，不，不是这样的。

文化告诉你，做你自己，如果你有问题，就找一个方法解决。现在让我引用一下刘易斯在《人之废除》一书中的话，我刚才试着读给你们听。刘易斯说，如果你想总结现代与古代的区别，听我说： 他说，对于古人来说，核心问题是如何使现实适应我们，解决方案是知识、自律和美德。他说，这就是古人的方法。

我们的问题在于我们没有使自己适应现实。我们如何使现实适应我们？答案就是通过美德和智慧来改变自己。但今天，他说，问题是如何让现实屈服于我们的愿望。

这是现代人想要的，而解决办法是技术。比如，许多自认为不受文化影响、只受圣经影响的基督徒，在这个方面实际上比他们想象的更多地受到了文化的左右。我举一个例子。多年来，人们经常来找我，说他们有一个大问题。

他们需要做一个选择，要么这样，要么那样；要么从这个，要么从那个。他们想分辨出上帝的心意，想知道上帝的旨意是什么。这当然是很灵性的。是的，这是对的。

我只是希望做上帝想要我做的事情，好吧？所以我想知道，在祷告时，你怎样才能辨别出上帝要的是哪个选项？换句话说，有没有一种祷告的方式，让我能感受到上帝在引导我？也就是说，当我为这个、那个或者这个、那个祷告时，如果我在祷告中感到更平静，是不是意味着那是上帝在告诉我？

我是怎么分辨出上帝是在指引我并告诉我该做什么的？我的回答通常对他们来说并不令人满意。我希望以后他们可能会觉得满意。因为我总是说，祈祷是成为一个明智的人的重要部分。

我们接下来几周还会再讨论这个话题。但我告诉他们，你需要它。从圣经的角度来看，这是如何辨别上帝旨意的方法： 你通过多年的训练、学习、了解上帝、熟悉圣经、认识自己的内心、经历苦难以及接受他人的纠正，慢慢变得有分辨力、洞察力、谨慎和明智。然后，在你面临选择时，选择你觉得最好的那个选项。

因为当你来找我说，我想知道在祷告中如何把事情摆出来，看看上帝想要什么。这听起来像是一个技巧。哦，我只是想知道上帝想要什么。换句话说，这听起来像是一个技巧。

你正在做的是你的文化所期望的。不是让灵魂适应现实，而是让现实适应灵魂。不是你改变自己，而是找到一种在遇到情况时可以使用的技巧。实际上，并没有花时间祈祷。

并没有花时间接受纠正和学习。没有这些年的经验。你什么都没有。这是个技巧。

你们看到了我们面临的问题吗？这就是智慧，与生活的现实保持联系，对这些现实有所掌握。**真正的问题在于，我们都天生是**愚昧的。如果我们不学习如何做出明智的选择，这将毁灭我们。

那么，我们如何去寻找这种智慧呢？现在，我们现在能做的就是指明接下来几周的内容，这里有一节经文告诉我们如何开始这场搜索。你如何找到这种智慧？这就从这里开始了。

就在那里。事实上，那就是这个词。看看第七节。这是《圣经》中最著名的经文之一，因为它被反复引用。

敬畏耶和华是知识的开端，但愚昧人轻视智慧和训诲。

## 寻找智慧：喜乐的敬畏与十字架 / Finding Wisdom: Joyful Fear and the Cross

Here's the last thing I'm going to tell you. Here's how you find wisdom. It's through paradoxical fear and the foolishness of grace.

Paradoxical fear and the foolishness of grace. So, first of all, paradoxical fear. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.

Don't you notice how strange it is that fear here is obviously a positive thing? You and I would think of fear as negative. In fact, there's many places in the Bible that see fear as negative.

Right? The Bible says perfect love casts out fear. Fear is bad.

The Bible says God has not given us a spirit of fear. So why is the fear of the Lord here a positive kind of fear? Well, there's a negative and a positive kind of fear.

Do you know what they are? There's two ways to be afraid in the presence of someone. The first way is you're afraid if you think they may hurt you or hurt you or say something mean to you.

In other words, if you distrust the person, you really distrust that person. They might say something really mean, they may do something to hurt you. So if you go into the presence of someone you really distrust, you can be kind of scared.

But there's another way to go into the presence of someone to be afraid. Right after the first Lord of the Rings movie came out, a lot of the actors who were in the first movie were at a Barnes and Noble downtown. I think it was on...

Yeah, I can't remember where it was exactly, but it was downtown somewhere. And Kathy and I went and one of the people who was there was Christopher Lee, big tall Christopher Lee with the... You know, he placed Saruman in the Lord of the Rings and he's in his 80s now.

But he talked about one time running into when he was a younger man somewhere, JRR Tolkien himself, whose works he just loved and revered. And he talked about the fact that he went all kind of trembling. And I raised that set and is the Christopher Lee voice.

And he says, when he met Tolkien, he says, and I almost note. Now, here's the point. When you find yourself in the presence of somebody who's so revered, you were in such awe of...

Have it ever happened to you? You just get a tremble. But it's a positive fear, it's not a negative fear.

See, you can be afraid of... The negative fear is you're afraid that somebody's going to hurt you, because you distrust them. A positive fear is you're afraid you're going to disappoint them.

You're going to dishonor them. Is it going to grieve them or something? Because you love them so much.

Because you appreciate them so much, right? The negative fear is actually selfish. I'm afraid I'm going to get hit.

But the positive fear is actually all about the person. I don't want it in any way to dishonor this person or bore this person or offend this person or certainly grieve this person. And that is the fear of the Lord.

That is a fear that is a joyful fear. It's a positive fear. It's on wonder before him.

It's not being afraid he's going to condemn you. You're afraid that he's going to hurt you? You're afraid in a sense that you're going to grieve him.

If I put in a priceless Ming dynasty vase in your hands, it was beautiful. It was thousands of years old and with worth millions of dollars, you might get scared. Why?

Not because you're afraid it's going to hurt you. You're afraid you're going to hurt it. And the fear of the Lord is a joyful fear.

It's such on wonder and such love that you don't want to grieve him or do anything to avoid dishonoring him. Now, if you had that kind of fear, do you realize how different that is? How different that is from just believing in God?

And do you realize that most people in the world are obeying God out of negative fear? Negative fear is, I've got to obey God. Otherwise, he's going to hit me.

But if you had the positive fear, if you had this joyful fear, do you realize what that would do? It would make you wise. You know how?

First of all, you wouldn't be simple. If you had this kind of relationship with God, if God meant this to you, if you had this sense of his love and his delight in you and if you wanted more than anything else to give love and delight to him, then you wouldn't care what other people think. You wouldn't be a simpleton.

You wouldn't be wayward. You wouldn't care what other people think. This also wouldn't be an obstacle because you wouldn't care what you think anymore.

You wouldn't have that insecurity that needs to be right. You wouldn't be standing on your own dignity. There'd be humility.

There'd be an ease, there'd be an openness. The fear of the Lord, this positive joyful fear of the Lord would be the very beginning of your wisdom. How do you get that?

The only way to get it is to be absolutely sure that God is not going to hurt you. To be absolutely sure that in spite of your flaws, he will not condemn you. The difference between a converted person, a person with a new heart, a person who understands the gospel, and a person who is just nuckling under, is a difference between a person with the positive fear of God versus the negative fear of God, right?

就是这样。最后我要告诉你们一件事。这就是你如何找到智慧的方法：通过悖谬的恐惧与恩典的愚蠢。

悖谬的恐惧与恩典的愚蠢。首先，悖谬的恐惧。敬畏耶和华是知识的开端。你有没有注意到这里的恐惧显然是积极的？

你我都会认为恐惧是消极的。事实上，《圣经》中很多地方都将恐惧视为消极的东西。对吧？《圣经》说完全的爱驱除恐惧，恐惧是坏事。

《圣经》还说神没有赐给我们惧怕的心。那么为什么这里的“敬畏耶和华”是一种积极的恐惧呢？好吧，有积极和消极两种恐惧。你知道它们是什么吗？

有两种方式在某人面前感到害怕。第一种是你害怕是因为你认为他们可能会伤害你或对你不友好。换句话说，如果你对这个人缺乏信任，你真的不相信他。他们可能说一些很刻薄的话，或者做一些伤害你的事。

所以当你面对一个你非常不信任的人时，你会有点害怕。但还有另一种方式在某人面前感到害怕。就在第一部《指环王》电影上映后不久，很多参与第一部电影的演员们都在市中心的一家巴诺书店聚会。我想是在…… 是的，具体在哪里我已经记不清了，但那是在市中心的某个地方。

我和凯茜去的时候，其中一个人就是克里斯托弗·李，那个高大的克里斯托弗·李，你知道的，他在《指环王》中饰演萨鲁曼，现在已经八十多岁了。他提到了年轻时有一次遇见JRR 托尔金本人的经历，他对托尔金的作品非常热爱和敬仰。他说当时自己浑身发抖。我试着模仿了一下克里斯托弗·李的声音。

他说，当他遇到托尔金的时候，他说几乎要颤抖了。现在，这里有个要点。当你发现自己面对一个如此受人尊敬的人时，你会感到敬畏…… 你经历过这种情况吗？你会不由自主地发抖。

但这是一种积极的恐惧，而不是消极的恐惧。你看，你可以害怕……消极的恐惧是因为你不信任某个人而怕被伤害。但积极的恐惧是怕自己让对方失望，怕让自己蒙羞或让他们伤心。因为你非常爱他们，非常尊重他们，对吧？

消极的恐惧其实是自私的，你担心会被打。但积极的恐惧完全是关于那个人的——你不想以任何方式冒犯他、让他厌烦、让他生气，甚至让他伤心。这就是敬畏主。这是一种充满喜悦的恐惧。

它是一种积极的恐惧，是对他的敬畏和惊叹。它不是怕他会谴责你。你是怕他会伤害你吗？你有一种感觉，怕自己会让他伤心。

如果你手里拿着一个价值连城的明王朝瓷器，虽然美丽、历史悠久且价值数百万美元，你会害怕什么？不是因为你怕它会伤害你，而是怕你可能弄坏了它。敬畏主就是这样一种喜悦的恐惧。它是如此的惊叹和爱，以至于你不希望让他失望或做任何事情来避免冒犯他。

如果你有这种恐惧，你能意识到这有多么不同吗？这与仅仅相信上帝是多么的不同啊！并且你们知道吗？世界上大多数人是出于负面恐惧而顺服神的。

负面恐惧就是，我必须顺服神，否则他会惩罚我。但如果你们有正面的恐惧，即快乐的恐惧，那会怎样呢？它会使你变得聪明。你知道为什么吗？

首先，你不会那么单纯。如果你与神有这样的关系，如果神对你来说很重要，如果你感受到他的爱和喜悦，并且你比什么都希望向他付出爱和喜悦，那你就不会在意别人的看法。你不会那么单纯。你也不会迷失方向。

你不会在乎别人的想法。这也不是障碍，因为你不再会只在意自己的想法了。你不会有那种需要被认可的不安全感。你不会再执着于自己的尊严。

你会变得谦卑。你会感到轻松自在，更加开放。对神的正面快乐恐惧将是智慧的开端。那我们如何得到这种正面的恐惧呢？

唯一的办法就是确信神不会伤害你。确信尽管你有缺点，他也不会定你的罪。一个重生的人、一个新心的人、一个明白福音的人与只是勉强顺服的人之间的区别就在于他们是否拥有对神的正面恐惧和负面恐惧的区别。

## 恩典的愚拙：十字架是真智慧 / The Foolishness of Grace: The Cross as True Wisdom

And how can you get that positive fear of God? We've got to know that there is no condemnation for you. And the only way to do that is this, put the book of Proverbs in the whole Bible, put it in the context of the whole Bible, and in the Old Testament we know there's a negative and positive fear, but when you get to the New Testament, we learn there's also a negative and positive foolishness.

Negative foolishness we've been looking at, but there's a positive foolishness, St. Paul talks about it. It's the foolishness of the cross.

It's the foolishness of Christ, it's the foolishness of grace. What does he mean when Paul talks about the foolishness of the cross? Well you see when Jesus Christ came to earth as the Messiah, and he says, I am the Messiah, I have come to bring the kingdom of God.

Now in the world's eyes, if you're coming to breathe the king and to clean this place up and to make everything okay again and to deal with evil and suffering and injustice, what would you do? You'd come as a general with an army and you'd smite the evil doers or you'd come as a philosopher and you would convince everybody and but he goes to the cross and he becomes weak and he dies on the cross and Paul says, by the world standards, that's foolishness, but they don't realize it's actually a consummate wisdom and here's the reason why. The reason that the world sees the cross as foolishness is that when we look at all the evil in the world, everybody's got a theory about what's wrong with the world.

If Jesus Christ had dealt with it, they would have come and hurt those people or those people to see. We all have a theory about what's wrong with the world and it's never us. It's never us.

It's them. It's Democrats. It's Republicans.

Say, in other words, there's always a, there was really making this world a bad place is those people over there where wise in our own eyes were fools and therefore if Jesus Christ goes to the cross, it looks foolish but his consummate wisdom because only by going to the cross and taking our punishment, the punishment that we deserve, could God someday be able to end evil without ending us. Fools who are wise in their own eyes think the cross is foolishness, it's actually wise. And Paul says, oh, the foolishness of God is wiser than the wisdom of men, the weakness of God is stronger than the strength of men.

And he says, if you want to become a Christian, you've got to become a fool. The fool for Christ, first of all, you've got to admit you have been a fool and you've been wise in your own eyes and you have to embrace the foolishness of the cross and look like a fool to the world, especially in a place like New York. But then you'll know there's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.

You know, Psalm 134, Psalm 131, I'm going to say it again because I'm afraid I've said so many of the things you're going to forget it in the mass of stuff, I've said Psalm 134 says, because you've forgiven me, because I see your forgiveness and grace, therefore I fear you. First of all, I read that. I said, that doesn't make any sense at all because I was thinking of negative fear.

But you see what it's saying? When I see how gracious you are, when I see how good you are, when I see what you did to save me, when I saw where, when I see your grace and your goodness, it makes me tremble. I'm afraid.

I'm afraid of grieving you, afraid of dishonoring you, afraid of disappointing you in any way. And when you have that joyful fear, it's the beginning of wisdom. Go get it, but it's great.

Our Father, as we take the elements of your supper, the bread and the cup, these are things that the world sees as foolishness, but we know them as wisdom and we pray that you would tell us again right now about the greatness of what you did for us, so that we can increase in our joyful fear and become more and more wise, like your Son, in whom all the treasures of knowledge and wisdom are hid, it's an isn't that we pray, amen. Thanks for listening to today's teaching. It's our prayer that you were encouraged by it and that it helps you apply the gospel to your life.

那我们如何得到这种正面的恐惧呢？

我们必须知道你没有被定罪。而唯一的方法就是将智慧书放在整本圣经中去理解，这样在旧约我们知道有正面恐惧和负面恐惧，在新约我们也学到有正面愚蠢和负面愚蠢。我们已经研究了负面愚蠢，但还有正面愚蠢，圣保罗提到过，这就是十字架的愚拙。这是基督的愚拙，是恩典的愚拙。

保罗提到十字架的愚拙是什么意思呢？你看，当耶稣基督作为弥赛亚来到地上时，他说：“我是弥赛亚，我来是要带来神的国。” 在世人的眼中，如果你要来治理这个国家、清理这个地方，并让一切重新变得美好，解决邪恶和痛苦与不公，你会怎么做？你可能会带着军队以将军的身份出现，打击作恶多端的人；或者你可能以哲学家的身份出现，说服所有人。

但耶稣却走向了十字架，变得软弱，最终在十字架上死去。保罗说，在世人看来，这是愚拙的，但他们不明白这其实是至高的智慧。原因在于：世人之所以认为十字架是愚拙的，是因为当我们看到这个世界上所有的邪恶时，每个人都有自己的理论来解释世界出了什么问题。如果耶稣基督解决了这些问题，人们就会去攻击那些人或被他们攻击。

我们每个人都有一种理论来解释世界的问题，但从来都不是我们自己。总是别人：民主党人、共和党人……换句话说，真正让这个世界变得糟糕的是那边的人。自以为聪明的人其实是愚拙的。因此，当耶稣走向十字架时，在世人看来是愚蠢的，但实际上这是至高的智慧——只有通过走向十字架，承担我们应得的惩罚，神才能有一天能够结束邪恶而不终结我们自己。

那些自认为聪明的人认为十字架是愚拙的，但实际上是智慧的。保罗说：“神的愚拙总比人智慧，神的软弱总比人强壮。” 他这样说：如果你想成为基督徒，你必须成为一个愚昧的人。首先，基督的愚昧人啊，你必须承认自己曾经是愚昧的，并且自以为聪明，然后你要拥抱十字架的愚昧，让自己在世人眼中看起来像个傻子，尤其是在像纽约这样的地方。

但这样你会知道，在基督耶稣里的人没有定罪。你知道吗？诗篇134篇和诗篇131篇，我还要再说一遍，因为怕你们记不住那么多东西，诗篇134篇说：因为你饶恕了我，因为我看见你的恩典与慈爱，所以我敬畏你。首先，当我读到这一段时，我想的是负面的恐惧。

但你看它在说什么？当我在你面前看到你的恩典和慈爱，当你为救赎我所做的一切让我看到你的恩典和慈爱时，这会使我颤抖。我会害怕。我害怕冒犯你，害怕羞辱你，害怕以任何方式让你失望。

而当你有这样的敬畏，它就是智慧的开始。去争取吧，但这很棒。我们亲爱的天父，在我们领受圣餐的元素——饼与杯的时候，世界会认为这些是愚昧的事物，但我们知道它们是智慧。求你再次告诉我们你为我们所做的一切的伟大，好让我们增加这种因敬畏而来的喜乐，并且越来越像你的儿子一样聪明，因为所有的知识和智慧都隐藏在你的儿子里面。

我们如此祷告：阿们。感谢你们今天聆听这教导。愿它鼓励了你们，并帮助你们将福音应用到生活中去。更多来自提姆·凯勒的有益资源，请访问gospelunlife.com。
