## 为什么祷告很重要 我们生活在一个缺乏经历的社会中，对权威感和灵魂深处的深刻体验极度匮乏。因为我们生活在一种世俗的技术社会里，一切都被简化为商品。所有的——冥想、健身计划、心理治疗、新纪元运动——这些都是祈祷的替代品，因为我们在生活中没有祈祷或不知道如何祈祷而留下了真空。无论性爱多少次，无论接受多少次心理治疗，无论进行多少次冥想，都无法取代祷告，因为祷告是与无限者的亲密接触。

## 祷告有多难 我确实知道，30分钟的祷告比30分钟的讲道更难。我从未有过一场糟糕到让我忘记自己在讲道的讲道。但很多时候当我跪在宇宙之王面前时，我会忘记自己在祈祷。约翰·牛顿说，在他试图祈祷的时候，他会感到如此虚弱，以至于有时“房间里的苍蝇嗡嗡声都成了对他力量的压倒性优势。

### Why Prayer Matters

We live in a society starved for experience, absolutely starved for a sense of authority and for any kind of deep experience of the soul. Because we live in a secular technological society that reduces everything to commodity. All of this—the meditation, the workout regimens, the therapy, the New Age movement—these are substitutes for prayer, for the vacuum left in our lives because we do not pray or don't know how to pray.

No amount of sex, no amount of therapy, no amount of meditation can substitute for prayer, which is intimacy with the infinite. ### Prayer is Difficult

I happen to know that it's harder to pray for 30 minutes than it is to preach for 30 minutes. I've never had a sermon so bad that I forgot I was preaching.

But many times when I've been on my knees before the King of the universe, I've forgotten I was praying. John Newton says that when he's trying to pray, he feels so weak that sometimes "the buzzing of a fly in the room is an overmatch for my strength."

### The Basis of Prayer

Jesus says, "Our Father." Not "our King" (though he is), not "our Creator" (though he is), but "our Father."

Jesus was the first person to call God Father in the Bible. When Jesus called God Father, everybody was shocked.

If you belong to Jesus, you automatically receive his status. You can talk to God as Father. My Father in heaven loves me more than I love myself.

### The Essence of Prayer: Praise

Only three small petitions in the Lord's Prayer. Everything else is about God. Adoration is the only thing that will heal us.

Job's self-pity drained out because your self-pity comes from forgetting it's all of grace. His worry drained out because worry comes from forgetting God's goodness. His resentment drained out because resentment comes from forgetting it's all God's mercy.

Jesus Christ said: I want you to pray all the time so you don't faint. Those are the only two alternatives. You can pray or faint.

” ### 祷告的基础 耶稣说：“我们的天父。”而不是“我们的君王”（尽管他是），也不是“我们的创造者”（尽管他是），而是“我们的父亲”。耶稣是圣经中第一个称呼上帝为父亲的人。当耶稣称上帝为父亲时，所有人都感到震惊。

如果你属于耶稣，你自然会获得他的身份。你可以像对父亲那样与上帝交谈。我的天父爱我胜过我自己所爱的一切。### 祷告的本质：赞美 主祷文只有三个小请求。

其余的都是关于上帝的。敬畏是唯一能治愈我们的东西。约伯的自怜消失了，因为你的自怜来自于忘记这一切都是恩典。他的忧虑消失了，因为忧虑来自于忘记上帝的美好。

他的怨恨消失了，因为怨恨来自于忘记一切都是神的怜悯。耶稣基督说：我希望你们一直祈祷，以免昏倒。这只有两种选择。你可以祈祷或昏倒。
