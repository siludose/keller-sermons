# Jesus as King; The King of Hearts / Jesus as King; The King of Hearts

## Chinese Translation / 中文翻译 / English Transcript

Welcome to Gospel in Life. Who is Jesus? The Bible says He's fully God, the creator of the universe, and at the same time, fully human.

Lose one of those and you lose Christianity. Join us for today's podcast where Tim Keller explores the person and promises of Jesus Christ. 2 Corinthians 10, 1-6.

This is Paul speaking. By the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I appeal to you, I, Paul, who am timid when face to face with you, but bold went away. I beg you that when I come I may not have to be as bold as I expect to be toward some people who think that we live by the standards of this world.

For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does. The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world, on the contrary. They have divine power to demolish strongholds.

We demolish arguments in every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ. And we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience once your obedience is complete. And this is God's word.

We've been talking about Jesus as prophet, priest, and king. There's a place in Matthew 12 where Jesus says, the men of Nineveh will stand up in judgment and condemn this generation. For they repented at the preaching of Jonah and behold a greater than Jonah is here.

And the queen of the south will rise up on the judgment day and condemn this generation for she came from the ends of the earth to Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon is here. That's a very dramatic statement. And you see what he's saying?

He is saying, a greater than Jonah, I'm the ultimate prophet, a greater than Aaron or Moses on the ultimate priest, a greater than Solomon on the ultimate king. That's quite a challenge, and that's quite a claim. But what we're going to look at here tonight is what does that mean?

Now it shouldn't come of surprise to you that historically Christians and people who have studied the Bible have seen that Jesus Christ executes his office. That means he carries out his office of king in two different ways. He carries it out spiritually in the hearts of his people and he carries it out cosmically in history.

And we're not going to talk about the second ones tonight. We're going to talk about the first one. Because what we have here is an interesting description of how Jesus Christ approaches the human heart.

What does it say? It says, though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does. The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world in the contrary.

They have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments and every pretension it sets itself up against the knowledge of God and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ. What is this describing?

First of all, what is describing implicitly and then secondly, what is describing explicitly? Implicitly, tacitly, in other words, it's unstated but completely assumed and therefore taught in the passage that Jesus Christ is king. And the reason we say Jesus Christ is king is because it says every thought has to be obedient to Christ.

Every thought. My neighbor comes to me and asks me for a cup of sugar. And if I say no to my neighbor, I may be unkind, I may be rude, I may be uncompassionate, I may be a bad neighbor but I'm not disobedient.

You're only disobedient if you owe something to somebody, if that person has some rights over you. And the fact that every thought, not just part but every thought of my life and my heart, every dimension therefore of my being has to be made obedient to Christ means he's my absolute monarch. So for example, I may have to be obedient to the police officer, why?

Well, it's part of what it means to be a citizen of the city. The police officer asked me to do something and I should obey because in a certain narrow focus or scope, in a certain narrow scope, the police officer has rights over me. Now, it's all part of the social contract, it's all part of what it means when I decide to live in a place like New York City and when I become a citizen of the United States and when I elect representatives and they appoint this and they appoint that, the police officer cannot tell me who to marry.

At that point, the police officer is making a suggestion. The police officer says, I want you to marry my sister-in-law or I'm going to give you a ticket. You can't do that.

He's got a scope. He says, you must do this when you get to that stop sign or I'm going to run you in. He has the right to do that.

He has rights over me. So there is a part of my life in which I have to obey the police officer and then of course you can talk about all sorts of relationships we have in which we owe things to people. A person who's done a great deed for you, a good friend.

And very often, if that person is sacrificed for you and you know that that person has done something for you, you sense a certain moral authority that that person has over you. You don't have to spell it out. You don't have to think it out.

You just recognize a moral authority. And you know therefore that if that person who has, let's just say, a person who gave you enough money to stay in school, that last semester, so you could graduate. So you were able to make it through college.

If a person like that comes to you and asks for a cup of sugar and you say no, you probably are in a sense being disobedient because you realize that a small request like that from a person like that is is disobedient because that person has some kind of moral right over you. So when we talk about obedience, we mean the person we owe some kind of authority to, some kind of deference to. In this case, we have an unparalleled claim.

It doesn't just say that Jesus Christ wants you, wants you on Sunday or Jesus Christ just wants your will. He wants you to obey the Ten Commandments. It says Jesus Christ is demanding the captivity of every thought.

That means his authority and his moral authority over you is absolute. Well, where does the Bible come off saying that? And it comes off this way and think about the logic of it and it's overwhelming logic, I think.

Were you created or are you an accident? There's really nothing in the middle, you know? Did someone or something with intelligence, rationality, something with a purpose create you?

If not, you are an accident and you know we sometimes spend time on this, I won't spend much time on this, but just think it out. Then we see a lump of lead that fell off of the, out of the sleuths in the factory which is taking lead and turning it into this or that part. And if a piece falls off, molten lead and it falls to the floor and it just forms some kind of arbitrarily formed puddle, and then it hardens, what do we call that?

It's an accident. You don't look at that thing and say, what's it for? Can you break it?

By the way, if you pick it up and it sort of squished and all like this and then you break it over your leg and it falls into two pieces, you don't say, oh, you broke it. You don't say that because it was already broke because it had no purpose. It wasn't useful.

You might be able to use it as a door stop or something like that, but you see it wasn't created for a purpose. So it's an accident. So there's no way to violate it and there's no way to break it and has no purpose.

For you, you, the result of the blind collision of forces. Are you an accident? Are you an accident of evolution?

Are you an accident of chemical reactions? Are you an accident? In that case, there is no purpose for you.

There's no right or wrong for you. There's no intention for your life. There's no meaning for your life.

There's no way for you to be broken. You may feel I'm depressed. There's something wrong.

If you aren't created, how are you to say what's wrong? That's wrong. Whatever is is.

Nobody likes to live with that, nobody likes to believe that, and also nobody really does believe that because you sense that there is something about me that is of design. So most of us want to say I was created. I'm not an accident, but if you were created, what rights would your creator have over you?

Think of it this way. What if you had poured tremendous amount of energy, creative energy, all of your talents into a song? It's the best song you ever wrote, okay, you musicians.

And before you have a chance to copyright it, somebody picks it up, sells it him or herself, gets the credit for it, and makes a zillion dollars. How would you feel? Now because you were so maybe dumb as to not get a copyrighted, there's no way that you can really, legally, say, that's mine.

You can't prove it. But the person did was perfectly legal. Yet you would feel I have moral rights, I have moral rights over that song.

Why? If it wasn't for me, it wouldn't exist. And the one using it couldn't have produced it.

Now this is all intuitive. We all know this. There's nobody in this room who would not experience that the same way.

You see, if it wasn't for me, it wouldn't exist. And the one using it couldn't have produced it and therefore should, I have moral rights. I have more rights.

Not saying I don't want anybody else to enjoy the song, I'm not saying I don't want anybody else to use the song. But I should have the ultimate moral rights over that thing. Or the same thing would happen if you invented a new fuel injection apparatus for an automobile in your basement so that the car that uses it would get 300 miles to a gallon.

Somebody else comes along and takes it. Starts using it. How would you feel?

You have moral rights over that. If it wasn't for me, it wouldn't exist. Now, what if, and plenty of you do, and plenty of us do, and all of us do, at a certain point, before we get converted into Christianity, what if you decide, I alone have the right to decide what to do with my body, what to do with my sexuality, what to do with my talent, how to spend my money, how to use my time, I and I alone.

Did you produce that talent? Whether you're an accident, or you've been created, in which case, that creator, if we could find them, if we could communicate with them, if there's a creator, has ultimate moral rights over you, and for you to be going off and taking the things, the things that have risen out of resources that you did not generate, you couldn't have produced, and using them for your own profit, without deference to him, without saying, what do you want me to do with my money, what do you want me to do with my talent, what do you want me to do with my brain, what do you want me to do with my sexuality, just as bad, or worse, because let me tell you, the creative energy that goes into a song is great as that it is nothing like the creative energy that goes into a human being. Every thought, every moment, every dimension of your life belongs to the one who created it, without which, without whom, excuse me, without whom, none of this would exist, none of you would exist, no part of you would exist, see?

Therefore, when the Bible says, every thought, every one of your thoughts belongs to Jesus, it is assuming that this is the one who created you, and let me tell you one thing, there really isn't much in between. You can either say, I'm an accident, and therefore I can do anything I want, but you have to live with the consequences of the fact there's no right and wrong, if to live with the consequence of the fact there is no meaning except that which you manufacture, if to live with all that, or else you have to say, I owe my creator every single thought, every dimension, not just Sunday's, not just a tip of the hat, everything, absolute, rightful king, and before we move on, let me just appeal to you, I want you all to know that most of you are Americans, and even those of you who aren't from America have maybe been here long enough to sort of imbibe the American, Western, individualistic culture, and I want you to know and be aware and be completely cognizant of how prejudiced you are against this whole idea. When you come to the Bible, and when you come to the Christian message, you have to realize what a filter you have over your mind, and you're screening out an awful lot of the absolute natures of the claims of Christ and the message of Christianity, because John Guest is an Episcopalian pastor who has been in America for a long time, but he came here in his 20s from Britain, he was an Anglican minister, and years ago I heard him give a talk, and I don't know if he mentions this illustration anymore, maybe you heard it, if you know him or heard him before, he, when he first came to this country he said he was struck, because he went to a some historic site, and he was going into a place that was a revolutionary war era tavern, that had been preserved the way it was in America during the Revolutionary War, this must have been either filled out for your Boston I think, and he went in and he saw the tavern, and he noticed it was a sign from the era, up, over the tables, and it said we serve no sovereigns here, you know, kind of American in your face, we don't have kings here, we've got presidents, they do what we want, if they don't do what most a 51% of us want, they're out of there, we don't have kings, we serve no sovereigns here, and John Guest said he suddenly realized he was in a different culture, he said you know, he says in Europe we're secular people, I said you know we're not this wonderful, we're not wonderfully moral people, he says but I tell you at least we still have some positive memories of bowing the need to a sovereign, we at least have some positive vibrations about that, people from the East, Asians very often also come from a situation in which at least the positive benefits of authority and submission are held up, but when you come to America, you come to one place where that notion, the notion of a king is anathema, the notion of a king is really repugnant, it's very much a part of who we are, it's very deep in us, there is no higher authority than my individual conscience, and every single person who's been in America for very long, that is so much a part of us that nobody, no Americans ever come to these kinds of passages and this kind of teaching objective, you're not objective, you are not open minded when it comes to these things, you hate the idea, we'll get into why I admit, but you have to see that, but what do you do about it?

What do you do about it is this, it's a great place, and I can't quote it exactly, but it's really sunk into my memory, in a book, which is probably at the book table or it ought to be, or we'll be soon, right David, because I'm mentioning it, so you'll be run with it, a Becky Pippert wrote a book called Out of the Salt Shaker, which is really a book on how to share what Christ has done for you with other people, there's this one wonderful section in which she says, just remember, when people say they want to be free and they don't want to have to submit to a king, just remind them that everybody's got a king, everybody's got a lord, and she says something like this, she says, those who seek power, those who seek power, that's the thing you're seeking, then you're serving power, power is mastering and ruling you, it's really what drives you, if you want approval in life, then you will be mastered, you see, ruled by image, or what people think of you, if you want money, then you will be ruled by money, if you say, ah listen, if you say, I don't, I don't submit to anybody, I belong to myself, then you're ruled by independence, you're the kind of person that has to do things, you have to do things, just to show that you don't owe anybody anything, and if you have to show that you don't owe anybody anything, to show that you owe nothing to anybody, that nothing rules you, you're ruled by your own independence, or no matter what, something is your lord, something is your king, you don't belong to yourself, so you have to realize the Christianity is not saying, you over here, you're free, you know, you don't serve anything but yourself, come and be captive to Christ, no Christianity, the offer of Christianity is this, you're a captive to something, your thoughts are captive to something, you know they are, the things that you feel like you've got to have, your thoughts are captive, you do not belong to yourself, and so the Christian message is, stop being ruled by things that tyrannize you and start being ruled by the one king that won't tyrannize you because he is your rightful king, he's the one that knows how you run, he's the one that knows who you are, and therefore you don't go from freedom to slavery to become a Christian, you go from slavery to freedom, because freedom is not a lack of a master, freedom is not the lack of a king but it's finding a true king for everybody's got one, no one is his or her own, so secondly, first we saw that this is implicit, Jesus is the king, every single part of you must be obedient to him, that's the implicit, but then explicitly it tells us how he exercises this kingship in our lives, and you know how he does it? This is very, very bold and also really neat, he is a conqueror, that means the way Jesus Christ exercises his kingship in our lives is he sees us as having captured a heart that belongs to himself, some other things are ruling in there, and therefore Paul says what Jesus does as a king is he comes and besieges your heart, the way a king would besiege his capital, that his now fallen under enemy hands, and this is something that Jesus does and unless you understand that this is the way in which he works, this is how he exercises his kingship, a lot of you are not going to be able to understand what's going on in your life right now, right now you may be under siege, there may be divine weapons being shot at you, see you may be finding that arguments and pretensions are being demolished by some kind of spiritual weaponry, this is what Jesus does to the human heart, this is how he comes, he comes as a conquering but let's see what the features of this, the features are, first this work is not a violent work in a sense of being physically violent or it's not a coercive violence at all, instead the kind of conquering that Jesus does is he seeks to win your heart and that literally means he seeks to get you to fall in love with him, that's the conquest, you know we have some predilection to talk this way when it comes to romance, you know we do talk a little bit about that, we talk like that sometimes, some of the love poetry says you've conquered me, all right I you know I didn't know who you were, I didn't really like you at first and yet I've been won by you, you see you've captured my heart, we use that sometimes in sort of drippy hyperbolic ways you know when we talk about what's happened to us when we fall in love but Jesus actually is using that terminology almost literally, look first of all his conquering work is full of gentleness and meekness in the very first verse Paul who's about to tell us that he is in Jesus army he's a preacher and he's a church planter and he says I am coming after you but not with my weapons, with divine weapons, in other words Paul is saying that with the way when he preaches the gospel when he persuades people to turn to Christ he is actually in Christ's army and therefore he's participating in this kingly conquering campaign that Jesus does when he besieges the human heart and that's what we see here but look he starts off talking about this warfare and this conquest by saying by the meekness and gentleness of Christ I appeal to you so we see that this conqueror is meek and gentle and he's after what your thoughts he's after your motives in other words he is not trying to get you to be coerced he's not trying to get you to be a begrudging slave he's not trying to force you to do thump something that you don't want to he wants to capture your heart he wants to soften your heart he wants your thoughts see to get your thoughts is to is to get you to see the delight that he is to see the love that he is to see the freedom that he is and he does it with meekness and gentleness look for example let me give you a great example of this Psalm 119 a very very long Psalm I would take you week to read it usually it's it's not a typical Psalm it's got it's very very long but there's a section of it in fact I could read you any section to show you an example of a conquered heart but let me read you just a section out of out of it verse 97 and so on right around there and the Psalmist says behold how I love your law I meditate on it all day long your commands make me wiser than my enemies further ever with me I have more understanding than my elders for I obey your precepts I have kept my feet from every evil path that I might obey your word how sweet are your words to my taste sweeter than honey to my mouth I gain understanding from them therefore I hate every wrong path now that is the language of a conquered heart that's not the language of a person who was just raised moral you know people who are raised moral a lot of you were raised in kind of conservative churches and raised not necessarily Christian churches conservative homes and conservative backgrounds and when you have a quiet time when you sit down and study the bible and pray you say I feel better I feel better but you don't feel close to God you just have some relief in your conscience you're afraid you may know the story of the prodigal son but it's not just about a wayward younger brother in fact Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who try to earn his love by being good in his book the prodigal God Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart of the gospel a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental older brother and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal extravagant grace whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith the prodigal God will help you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way the prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the hope and joy of Christ gracious and relentless love with people all over the world request your copy today at gospel and life dot com slash give that's gospel and life dot com slash give now here's doctor Keller with the rest of today's teaching I've had a lot of people tell me and I know I'm I'm in danger of throwing out here a you know a subject that I'm not going to be able to get back to and some preaching professor years ago said to me never you know raise more snakes than you can kill when you're sermon if you raise a snake make sure you have time to kill it I don't can't do this one but some of you know that one of the things that we say here at the Bible teaches is that once you become a Christian now there is no condemnation for those who were in Christ Jesus but once you truly are united to the Father through the Son there's no way that your sins can bring you ever back into a state of condemnation you're in ah well people say I'm glad I don't believe will you believe I don't believe that I say what I said well if if I knew that no matter what I did once I became a Christian there would be no condemnation for me what a temptation that would be I said well explain that to me how would that be a temptation say well I wouldn't have any incentive to live a moral life and I would say okay let me get this straight you're saying that if you would no longer be afraid of God no longer be afraid of his wrath no longer be afraid of his punishment no longer be afraid of him coming and getting you that you would lose all your incentive to live a moral life okay let me get this straight all your incentive is fear all of your incentive is negative and a lot of people who think their Christians have nothing but a negative morality they come to church because if they don't come to church they're conscience bothers and that's fine for a start that's a fine way to get on the path to real Christianity but that's all it is there's people who who are very careful in their business life to be straight arrows and everybody around them says oh yeah she he yeah very much is straight out very moral you know don't don't use that kind of language around her don't do this around him you know don't get them in on a deal like that you know they're pretty straight arrows they wouldn't like it and so forth and you know that you have that reputation feel pretty good about it it could all be fear your heart your thoughts your motives never conquered the reason that your moral is frickly because it's been inculcated in you since you were little you just you know it's very powerful to be told as a little kid don't do that never do that God will get you if that happens to you you know you don't lose that over the years and that's fine for a start it is fine for a start but that's not Christianity Jesus is not after that he's after something far far more deep than that the psalmist when you read Psalm 119 you'll see for example the psalmist does not see the Bible he's talking about by law he doesn't see the Bible is strictly a set of nice he doesn't see it as a book of virtues for example he doesn't see it as a set of esophs fables with morals at the end of it he calls the word of God he calls the Bible thy precepts thy commands you see I meditate on them I love them he knows that their words of the king he knows he has to obey them but look what he says he says they give me insight they make me great I there's one place where he says I pant after your commands what's going on here his heart's been captured the big big difference between a Christian and a moral person Paul says in 2 Corinthians 3 you know you're really a Christian when the law is written on your heart not just on your conscience when you find in your in most self that the law got a sweet you know in Psalm 1 it tells you the mark of a godly person it doesn't say godly person praise day and night though hopefully he or she will doesn't say that the godly person witnesses on the street corners day and night though of course I hope he will or she will I it doesn't say that that person goes to church every time the doors are open though I hope you know he or she will attend church regularly now you can do all that out of fear you know do all that without a heart that's been captured by the king with your thoughts not captive just your will now what is saying someone it says for he that's the godly man the lights in the law of God and upon it he meditates day and night he doesn't just read it and say I got to do it I better do it I better get to know it he meditates he chews on it he gets the sweetness out of it he loves to see it because he senses that the more he takes it in the more he's becoming something great he says I have more insight than my elders I love what this does for me think of it like this what if what if you were a gymnast what if you were a gymnast let's say you're a young girl but you're now you know you've never quite hit your peak you what at least you never hit what you think you should be able to do you haven't made it and how you're starting to get a little old in for your career ever to really be good and you're kind of frightened and somebody says let's let's take you to a really good coach I know of a good coach and the coach comes and the coach really starts to rigorously give you a lot of hard exercise and a lot of hard rules and all that but you begin to soar you begin to win and you begin to jump higher than you ever have and you begin to your body begins to do things that you never could do before you're flying because you're obeying and how would you look at the commands of your coach they'd be sweeter than honey to you you'd pant after them you say more more because I see what it's doing to me it's it's making me great has that happened to you ever see that's a very big part of what what Jesus does when he conquers your heart he brings it captive now how does he do it and the answer is good kings or I should say good generals if they're besieging a city don't just say to their their armies charge you know when and wherever you want you know a fire will instead a good king decides where they're going to attack on the wall and we have here two places that we're told that Jesus attacks it says what it says verse five now don't forget Paul is talking about we he's part of the army he's part of the thing but he's talking about Jesus campaign and he says with these with these weapons of divine power we demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God there's two things arguments and pretensions I'll try to be brief on this because even though each of these would be it would be great to go in the word arguments means just what it looks like rational arguments the word pretensions literally means high things proud things that's why that's not a bad it's not a bad you know some of these words are very hard to translate and the translators when they're sitting there trying to figure out the best word I know they must agonize that's not bad pretension to pretend means to try to to to be something that you're not and what this is telling us is there's two ways in which the king comes after you to win your heart one is more intellectual and one is personal let's just look at these two things for a minute the first thing is he comes after arguments a lot of modern people don't want to hear this but let me just explain what that means the Bible tells us that everybody has faith one of the things is so irritating for a thoughtful Christian when talking to people who don't believe Christianity is they say well you know if you could prove God to me I could believe but you can't and the implication is I'm a skeptical person you see I'm skeptical and I only believe what can be proved and if you're the faith the kind of person has faith fine you can't prove what you what you believe and if you could prove it to me then I would be very happy to to believe it's irritating because the assumption is I as a Christian have faith and it's sort of based on you know nothing and you don't have faith but that's not true the Bible says at the bottom of every single human being are arguments at the bottom of everyone are arguments you cannot make a move I gotta make sure I do this concisely and don't go off for 10 minutes I don't have time for that but you cannot make a choice you could for example just give a quick example let's just say all of your life you're taught don't have sex apart from marriage you know you were taught that out in Missouri but then you moved to New York and you come to New York and hear everybody thinks that only very odd strange people you know would adhere to that and so you start to feel attracted to somebody who obviously wants to have sex with you and you decide what you're gonna do it or not do you realize you can't make a decision about that unless your decision assumes either that the universe is ultimate that there is a creator god that he has spoken that he's got rules or that there's not if you decide to sleep with a girl or the guy why well you know intellectually you might not want to work at all out you don't want to work it out you don't want to think it out but what you've actually done is you've bought the argument that well there may not be a god but if there is a god we can't know what he teaches right aren't you assuming that there might be a god but if there is a god we can't know that he said anything about sexuality that is a religious assumption that is that's an axiom and you're basing your life on it you can't prove it anymore than I can prove it so you can't prove it's wrong anymore than I can prove it's right but don't you see what that means you are basing your life and you were practice on an axiom that is an axiom of faith and you are betting your destiny on it so when somebody says to me you can't prove god I say you can't prove there isn't god and even though this doesn't go too far but at least it gets after people at one certain level you can't prove that there isn't god and yet you're betting your life that there isn't I can't prove that there is a god and I'm betting my life that there is now we can talk once you're willing to admit that we both have faith and there were both betting and wagering our lives on our faith assumptions and we're both deeply religious because science can't tell you what there's a god or whether there isn't science can't tell you all these things now what Paul is getting at and what the Bible gets at and there's another other places where it talks about this is that there are arguments there are rational belief structures there are all there's a matrix of these faith assumptions underneath you and everybody no matter what you say about what where you stand with Christianity you've got a belief system you've got a matrix of these things you've got arguments that you're basing your life on the average non-Christian doesn't want to look at those things you don't want to look at them my sister-in-law some years ago had an interesting experience where she was at med school and and they were part she was part of an internship and they were doing the rounds all the other students were talking about a particular patient they said you know be better just to turn it all off and let the let the lady die because she's suffering and once she's dead she won't suffer and sometimes suicide is better because at least when when you're dead you're not suffering and my sister-in-law looked at them and said can you prove that how do you know that these people aren't going to hell now she said I'm not trying to argue right now that there is a hell but I'm trying to show you that your medical decision is assuming there's not well they say well you know there's no proof well there's no proof that there's not there is no way that you can make a move without all sorts of religious assumptions that's all I'm trying to say I'm not trying to prove the Christianity's right I'm not even saying please don't anybody get the impression that I'm saying that there's no way to show that one set of assumptions is better than another actually that's the whole point Paul says Jesus Christ will always come and show you your faith assumptions and show you that they're inferior that they don't explain reality like Christianity does that you can't really live consistently with them but the point is that Jesus Christ will always in order to win your heart make you think and I have people all the time coming to me and saying I've got problems in my life and I just want to connect with God they don't want to think is the Bible true or not well you know they like their argument that means they like their intellectual construct that allows them to say who knows but that's a faith assumption they don't want to have to examine it why because they want to be able to leave things out of the Bible they think that are primitive they don't like to think that maybe Jesus is the only way to God they think that you know they've got a modern construct that says all religions are ways to God how do they know that they don't know that it's a set of arguments they haven't thought it out they haven't thought out if that's logical if it's possible they don't want to think about that they want peace they want to connect with Jesus they want to walk by a river side and see the beauty of the Grand Canyon and they just want God to be real to them so they can handle their lives he never does that without demolishing arguments he never does that without making you think you see Christianity is based on hard truth objective truth propositional truth it's true or it's not true but to reject it takes a lot of thinking as well as to accept it and to reject it takes a faith commitment as well as to accept it and people aren't even willing to do that Jesus will not deal with you without making you think all people get very upset about this they don't want to have to think but he will always come in by demolishing arguments he'll show you there's a rational basis for what the Bible teaches there's a reason for the hope Christianity is full of truth claims they'll make you think there's no way to get his peace there's no way for him to capture your heart he'll always make you think but then on the other hand there's pretensions and you see underneath all the intellectual objections to the to the kingship of Christ our moral objections pretensions literally means high things that ultimately Paul was saying that besides the arguments and in some ways the strength of the arguments is our pride we don't we say we can't believe that's the arguments because we don't want to obey and that's the pretension pretension means self will the other day I had the experience of telling a 10 year old boy that his mother needed him he was in a bad mood and he stood up and he looked at me and he said she always needs me and when I go to her she asks me to do things that I hate he was furious he was just in a bad mood he was playing a video game didn't want to go now see I was and I thought about this I said you know that's the way children are all demands are unreasonable as far as a child's concern all demands are unreasonable I want to do what I want to do I don't want anybody telling me what to do every time I go to see my mother she has me to do things I don't feel like doing that's deep that's very deep and you don't think that when you start to approach God it's gonna go off and therefore there is something in us very deeply rooted that you have to admit I hope you see it that that keeps you from really being objective when it comes to Christianity you say I cannot put myself in a place where I am not am out of control I know what I want no one should have the right to tell me what to do and therefore when the king seeks to conquer your heart on the one hand he has arguments and he comes after you and he makes you think but on the other hand he's got to do something about your pride and therefore he puts out all kinds of humbling conditions and humbling circumstances and things that bring you to the end of your own resources this to me is a very very very practical verse it's telling me how almost everybody I know has ever found Christ conquering their heart and getting them getting getting you to love him it's never just humbling you without arguments or just arguing you without humbling it's always the two together unless something happens to show you that you do not have what it takes you're not competent to run your own life unless he does something about your high things you're just never going to come to him but on the other hand if you think he's going to come to you and you're going to come to him without thinking just having some kind of mystical experience it won't work either they both come together they have to come together and now let me conclude this way first of all to those of you who've really never given yourself to him just think about this you are in a position where you are going to have to be willing to see that some of the humbling things that are happening to you maybe because the king is trying to get you to love him he's dealing with your high things instead of saying why is he doing this to me he's meek and gentle remember that's the first where he's very meek and gentle but he will do what it takes it'll hurt him it says in lamentations three he does not willingly afflict the sons of men oh notice what it says he doesn't like it doesn't say he doesn't do it he says he doesn't willingly do it he doesn't like to do it he's meek and gentle a bruised reedy will not break it says in Matthew 12 a smoking flaxi will not quench till he brings forth judgment to victory but he'll do it and if you resist him don't tempt him because he will do what it takes to bring down your high things because he loves you or on the other hand you're going to have to start thinking you're going to have to start reading you have to start studying you have to go to classes you're going to have to study the Bible you have to talk to other people you're not going to ever get yourself to Christ through a misal experience you have to decide can I accept the Christian faith can I accept the teachings of the Christian faith they've got to happen that could be what needs to be done right now humble yourself under his mighty hand and he will exalt you in due time you know a perfect perfect in fact I don't know if he did it but John Dunn has his wonderful son at that he wrote and it's it's so much a great summarizing of this passage that it's hard not to think that he had it in my didn't have it in my when he wrote it you've heard it John Dunn batter my heart three person God for you as yet but knock breeze shine and seek to mend but I may rise stand overthrow me and bend your force to break blow burn and make me new hear that that I may rise and stand or

欢迎来到福音生活。耶稣是谁？圣经说他是全然的神，宇宙的创造者，同时又是全然的人。少了其中任何一个方面，基督教就会失去其核心。

今天，让我们一起聆听提摩太·凯勒关于耶稣基督的身份和应许的探讨。《哥林多后书》10章1-6节。这是保罗的话。凭着基督的温柔谦卑，我劝你们；我自己虽然在你们面前是胆怯的，但在外邦人面前却是刚强的。

我求你们，为我的缘故，要和我一同忍耐。因为我们虽然生活在世界中，却不按世界的法则争战。我们所使用的武器不是属世的，而是有神的能力，可以拆毁坚固的营垒； 将各样的计谋，各样拦阻人认识神的那些自高之事一概攻破了，又将人所有的心意夺回，使他都顺服基督。并且我必快来惩罚一切不服从的，你们也要和我一同忍耐。

我们一直在谈论耶稣作为先知、祭司和君王的身份。在马太福音12章中，耶稣说：“尼尼微人的悔改将要在审判的时候起来控告这一代人；因为尼尼微人因约拿的信息就悔改了，看哪！在这里有一个比约拿更大的人。”又说：“南方女王在审判的日子也要起来控告这一代人；因为她从地极而来，要听撒迦利亚所讲的道。

看哪！在这里有一个比撒迦利亚更大的。” 这是一个非常震撼的声明。你看到了他在说什么吗？

他是在说：我比约拿更伟大，我是终极的先知；比我亚伦或摩西更伟大，我是终极的祭司；比我所罗门更伟大，我是终极的君王。这是一项重大的挑战，也是一份重大声明。但今晚我们将探讨的是**这意味着什么。**你不会感到惊讶的是，在历史上，基督徒和圣经研究者都看到了耶稣基督履行其职分的事实。

**这意味着他以两种方式执行他的君王之职：一种是精神上的，在他子民的心中；另一种是宇宙性的，在历史中。**今晚我们不讨论第二种情况，我们要谈论第一种。因为这里描述了耶稣基督如何接近人的心灵。它说了什么？

它说虽然我们生活在世界上，却不按世界的手段争战；我们使用的武器不是属世的武器，而是有神的能力来推翻坚固营垒。我们可以拆毁那些用来抵挡神的知识的一切诡计，并且掳掠每一个思想，使它们顺服基督。这描述了什么呢？首先，这是在暗示什么？

其次，它明确说了什么？隐含地、不言而喻地说，这里假设并教导耶稣基督是王。我们说耶稣基督是王的原因在于，它提到每一思想都要顺服基督。每一个思想。

我的邻居来找我要一勺糖，如果我拒绝了他，可能我不友好，可能我粗鲁，可能我不体谅他人，可能不是一个好邻居，但并不意味着我是不顺服的。你只有在欠某人什么或那个人对你有某种权利时才算是不顺服。因此，每一个思想、生活的方方面面、心灵的每个维度都要顺服基督，**这意味着他是我的绝对君王。**比如，我为什么必须听从警察的要求？

因为作为某个城市的市民，在一个特定的狭义范围内，警察对我有一定的权力。这是社会契约的一部分，是当我选择像纽约这样的地方生活，并成为美国公民时所同意的内容。当选举代表并任命官员时，警察无权告诉我该娶谁。在那个时刻，警察提出建议。

他说：“你要娶我妹夫的妹妹，否则我就给你开罚单。”你不能这样。他有监控设备。他说：“当你到达下一个红绿灯时必须这样做，否则我就把你送进局里。

”他有权这么做。他对我有权力。所以在我生命的一部分中，我必须听从警察的话。当然，我们还可以谈论各种各样的关系，在这些关系中我们欠别人一些东西。

比如一个为你做了大好事的人，一个好朋友。很多时候，如果这个人为了你而牺牲了，并且你知道他们为你做了些什么，你会感觉到他们在道德上对你有一定的权威。你不需要明说，也不需要深思熟虑，你只是会感觉到这种道德上的权威。因此，如果你知道某人给了你足够的钱让你在最后一学期能够毕业，从而完成大学学业。

如果这个人后来向你请求一点糖，而你说不给，你可能就是在某种程度上违背了他们的意愿，因为你意识到像这样的人提出的小要求是对你的某种道德权利的挑战。当我们谈论顺服时，我们指的是对某人拥有一种权威或尊敬。在这种情况下，这种权威是无与伦比的。圣经并没有说耶稣基督只是希望你在周日见到他或者只希望你愿意他的意志，而是说耶稣基督要求你顺从十诫。

**这意味着他对你的权威和道德权威是绝对的。**那么，圣经凭什么这么说呢？它这样说是有逻辑的，我认为这是压倒性的逻辑。你是被创造出来的，还是只是一个偶然？

中间没有第三种情况。有人或某种有智能、理性，并且有目的的东西创造了你吗？如果没有，你就是一次偶然。有时我们会花时间讨论这个问题，但我不打算多谈，只是想一想。

想象一下工厂里炼铅的过程，从矿石提炼出铅，再制成某个零件。如果有一块铅在过程中脱落了，熔化的铅滴落到地上，形成一个任意形状的水坑，然后凝固了，你会怎么称呼它？这叫偶然。你不会看着那东西问：“这是干什么用的？

”或者“你能把它弄碎吗？” 顺便说一句，如果你拿起它，稍微压了一下，然后把它摔在腿上，摔成了两半，你不会说，“你把它弄碎了。”因为你本来就知道它是碎的，因为它没有用途。或许你可以把它当做一个门挡之类的东西用，但你看出来它并不是为了某个特定目的而创造的。

所以这就是一次偶然。因此，你无法违反它的规则，也无法打破它，因为它没有任何目的。对于你来说，你是力量盲目碰撞的结果。你是偶然吗？

是进化过程中的偶然产物？是你化学反应过程中的偶然结果吗？如果是这样，那你就没有存在的意义了。对你来说没有对错之分，你的生命也没有目标和意义。

你无法被“打破”。你可能会觉得我这么说很沮丧，有问题。如果你不是被创造出来的，你怎么能说哪里不对呢？这就是现状。

没有人愿意过这样的生活，没有人愿意相信这一点，而且实际上也没有人真正相信这一点，因为你感觉到自己身上有某种设计。所以大多数人会说：“我是被创造的，我不是偶然。”但如果你是被创造出来的，你的创造者对你有什么权利？换个角度来看，想象一下你倾注了巨大的创造力和所有才华写了一首歌，这是你写的最好的一首歌，音乐家们。

> 如果你不认为自己是被创造出来的，那你凭什么说哪里不对呢？这就是现状。在你有机会申请版权之前，有人已经把它拿走了，卖了，得到了荣誉，并赚了数以亿计的钱。你会有什么感觉？

因为你可能太蠢没有及时申请版权，所以你无法真正合法地说：“这是我的。” 你无法证明这一点，但那个人的行为却是完全合法的。然而，你会觉得你有道德权利，你对这首歌有道德上的所有权。为什么呢？

如果没有我，它就不会存在。使用它的那个人也无法创造出来。这都是直觉。我们都知道这个道理。

房间里没有一个人会以同样的方式感到不悦。你看，如果没有我，它就不会存在。使用它的那个人无法创造出来，因此我应该拥有道德权利。我有更多的权利。

我不是说我不希望别人享受这首歌，也不是说我不同意别人使用这首歌。但我是那个最终的道德权利持有者。或者就像你在地下室发明了一种新的汽车燃油装置，使得汽车每加仑可以跑300英里，结果有人来了把它拿走并开始使用它。你会有什么感觉？

你对这个有道德权利。如果没有我，它就不会存在。现在，假设在我们皈依基督教之前，有些人在某个时刻决定：“只有我自己有权决定如何处理我的身体、性行为、才能、金钱的花费以及时间的利用。” 这样的人很多，我们很多人都有过这样的想法。

你创造过那份才能吗？无论你是偶然出现的，还是被创造出来的，在这种情况下，如果能找到那个创造者，并且能够与之沟通，那么这位创造者对你的权利是至高无上的。而你却擅自拿走那些资源——这些资源不是你自己产生的，也不是你能制造的，然后用它们来谋取自己的利益，却没有丝毫尊重那位创造者，没有问过他：“您希望我怎么使用我的钱？您希望我怎么使用我的才能？

您希望我怎么运用我的智慧？您希望我怎么利用我的性情？”这同样糟糕，甚至更糟。让我告诉你，一首歌的创作能量固然巨大，但与一个人的生命相比，那简直是微不足道。

每一个念头、每一刻时光、你生命中的每一个维度都属于那位创造了它们的创造者——没有他，没有她，就没有这一切，你们就不存在，你们身体的任何部分都不可能存在，你看？因此，当圣经说你们每一个思想都属于耶稣时，它假设这个耶稣是创造你的人。让我告诉你一件事：其实中间并没有多少选择。你可以认为自己是个意外，所以可以随心所欲地做任何事，但你要为没有对与错的事实承担后果；或者你可以承认自己的一切思想、一切维度——不只是周日，而是全部，都属于你的创造者，绝对的君王。

在我们继续之前，请允许我提醒你：你们大多数是美国人，即使不是美国人，也已经在这里足够长的时间来吸收美国、西方的个人主义文化，并且要意识到你们对这个理念有多么偏见。当你面对圣经和基督教信息时，你要意识到自己思维中的过滤器，筛除了耶稣基督和基督教教义中许多绝对的本质。约翰·格斯特是一位在美多年的英国圣公会牧师，他年轻时来到美国，最初是作为圣公会牧师。多年前我曾听他讲过一个故事，或许你听过：当他第一次来这个国家时，在某个历史遗址参观了一家保存了革命战争时期样貌的酒馆。

他进去后看到酒馆里挂着那个时代的招牌，上面写着“我们不提供主权者”。这在美国革命时期的风格中显得很美国特色——我们没有国王，只有总统，他们要听从大多数人的意愿，否则就会被替换掉，我们没有国王，这里不供奉任何主权者。约翰·格斯特突然意识到自己身处一个不同的文化之中。他说，在欧洲我们是世俗的人，并不是什么了不起的道德模范。

你该怎么办呢？这是一个很好的地方，虽然我不能准确引用，但它确实深深地印在我的脑海中。在一本可能放在书桌上或者很快就会提到的书中，贝基·皮珀特写了一本书叫《盐罐之外》，这本书主要讲述如何与他人分享基督为你所做的一切。在这本书中有一个非常美妙的部分，她说：“记住这一点：当人们说他们想要自由，不想受制于一个国王时，你只需提醒他们，每个人都有一个国王，每个人都有一个主宰。

”她还说了类似的话：“那些寻求权力的人，实际上是在为权力服务；权力是支配和统治你的东西。如果你追求生活中的认可，那么你就会被形象所支配；如果你想要金钱，那么你就会被金钱所支配；如果你说：‘我不会向任何人臣服，我是属于自己的’，那么你就是被独立支配的——你必须做事情来证明自己不需要欠任何人什么。而如果你必须通过证明自己不欠任何人什么来表明你什么都不欠别人，那么你就是被你的独立性所支配了。无论怎样，总有一些东西是你的主宰、你的国王，你并不属于你自己。

” 所以，基督教并不是说：你在这里，你可以自由地只为自己服务。相反，它提供的是这样的信息：你是被某些事物所束缚的——你的思想被某些事物所束缚，你知道这是真的；那些你觉得非得拥有的东西，你的思想是被它们束缚的，你并不属于你自己。因此，基督教的信息就是：停止被那些压迫你的人或事所支配，开始接受那位不会压迫你的真正君王，因为他才是你的合法君王，他了解你如何运作，他知道你是谁。所以，成为基督徒并不是从自由走向奴役，而是从奴役走向自由——因为**真正的自由不是**没有主人，也不是没有国王，而是在找到一个对你来说是真君的国王之后的自由，因为每个人都有一个国王，没有人是自己的主宰。

我们首先看到的是这种信息是隐含的。然而，A太太却很好。B太太却抑郁了，为什么不是境遇让她们抑郁呢？其实让A太太和B太太抑郁的并不是境遇，而是她们自己在心里说了些什么。

是她们自己的内心想法导致了她们的抑郁你知道，对B太太来说，哪怕发生了什么不好的事情，她也会像她父亲说过的那样自责：“我永远也成不了气候。”于是她就会陷入抑郁。如果 同样的事情也发生在A太太身上，但她对自己说：“就像耶稣对我说的那样，你的内心在谴责上帝。”换句话说，如果你感到沮丧，找到那个念头；如果你生气，找到那个念头；如果你焦虑，找到那个念头。

然后让耶稣来捕捉它，让他把它扔掉，在那里放入他的真理。这就是你的问题所在，让耶稣捕捉每一个念头，带我去你那里，监禁我，因为我接受你，并且我会永远不再自由，也不会被追捕，除非你强行占有我。让我们向王祈祷，让我们向我们的父祷告，感谢你以这种方式来到我们中间，试图推翻并赢得胜利，击败我们以便提升我们到胜利中来。帮助我们在你的设计上看到这一点，也帮助这里每一个人在你们的身上看见你的设计。

现在生活中正在发生的事情只有当我们通过哥林多后书10章来看时才会被理解。求你让我们能够通过圣灵应用这个真理。奉耶稣的名祷告，阿门。约翰，你听到了，三一神啊，你还没有完全征服我的心，但请敲开我的心扉，让风来吹拂，让我承认你。

但是，我无法找到任何理由去捍卫自己，因为你的作为显明我是软弱且不真实的。然而，我深深地爱你，并愿意被爱，尽管是微弱的。我已将自己许给了你的敌人，请解除这个婚约，要么离婚，要么重新结盟。带我去你那里，监禁我，因为我接受你，并且我会永远不再自由，也不会被追捕，除非你强行占有我。

征服我吧，愿意让祂降低你高高的事物，愿意以基督徒的身份思考。朋友们，最后一件事我要对你们说：你们知道，你们会说：“我已经把自己献给基督了，他是我的主和救赎者。”但每一个念头都被俘虏了吗？这真的很难承认。

认知疗法的治疗师们对此很感兴趣，但他们没有加入基督教的内容。他们会问你：“你沮丧吗？你焦虑吗？你更好看看是什么让你产生这些情绪的想法。

总是有一个念头在下面。” 同样的事情也发生在A太太身上，以及Mrs. B身上。B 然而，A 太太很好，B 太太却抑郁了。为什么不是环境让 A 和 B 抑郁或好起来呢？

是她们自己在想什么决定了她们的情绪。如果 B 太太遭遇了坏事，她说：“就像我父亲说的，我永远也成不了大器。”她就会抑郁；而如果 A 太太同样遭遇了坏事，但她却对自己说：“正如我的主耶稣对我说过的，虽然你的意志可以压倒你的心，但上帝比你的心更强大。”换句话说，如果你感到沮丧，找到那个念头；如果你生气，找到那个念头；如果你焦虑，找到那个念头。

然后让耶稣来掌控它，让他把真理带进来。这就是你们的问题所在。抓住每一个念头，把我带到你面前，囚禁我，因为我接受你，除非你强行占有我，我永远无法自由，也永远不会被追讨。让我们祷告给君王，让我们祷告我们的父神：感谢你，因为你以这种方式来到我们中间，寻求击败我们、赢得胜利，帮助我们看到你的设计是什么，并帮助在座的每一位都能看到你对他们个人的设计是什么。

我们现在生活中发生的事情只有当我们通过哥林多后书10章来理解时才能明白。求你在圣灵的帮助下让我们能够应用这个教导。奉耶稣的名祷告。阿们。
