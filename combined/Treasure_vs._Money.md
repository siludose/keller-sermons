# 财宝与金钱 / Treasure vs. Money

**讲员**: 提摩太·凯勒 (Tim Keller)

---

Welcome to Gospel and Life. This month on the podcast, we are featuring a series on the Sermon on the Mount, a collection of teachings where Jesus outlines what it really means to live the Christian life. In the series, Tim Keller explores a striking idea that Christianity is not just different from the world, it's also radically different from religion.

Take a look in your bulletin, we have a passage on which the teachings based, we're going through the Sermon on the Mount, and we come to what Jesus has to say about money and possessions, and he has plenty to say, more than we can cover, but let's read it. Matthew 6, do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, where thieves break in and steal, but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal, for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. The eye is the lamp of the body.

If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light, but if your eyes are bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness? No one can serve two masters.

He will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money. Therefore, I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink, or about your body, what you will wear, is not life more important than food, and is not the body more important than clothes.

Look at the birds of the air, they do not sell or reap, or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them, and are you? Are you not much more valuable than they? Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?

And why do you worry about clothes? See how the lilies of the field grow? They don't labor or spin yet.

I tell you that not even Solomon and all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God closed the grass of the field, which is here today, and the mar was thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothes you? Oh, you little faith.

So do not worry saying, what should we eat, or what should we drink, or what should we wear, for the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first is kingdom, and is righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. Therefore, do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself.

Each day has enough trouble of its own, as God's word. Now the Sermon on the Mount talks about how, if we actually take the gospel, the essential message of Jesus Christ, we actually take the gospel, and we live it out. What will it look like, and that's what the Sermon on the Mount is about.

And now we get to the area of money and possessions, money and possessions. And Jesus tells us three things that we can draw out here. He tells us how money controls us, you know, how it has a power over us, how it exercises power.

So first of all, how money exercises power over us, and then secondly, why money exercises power over us, and then thirdly, how we can break the power, okay? How it exercises power, why it exercises power, and then how we break it. Now first of all, how money exercises the power over us, and one of the curious things for interpreters, or anybody who's reading and trying to understand the passage, is this illustration, this little saying about the eye.

It says the eye is the lamp of the body, and if your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light. If your eyes are bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. Now what that means is very simple.

We're in this room and there's light in this room. And if your eye works, it means if it takes the light in, you will by the light be able to move your body through the room. You know, you'll see where the eye is, and you'll move that way, and you know, you won't stumble, and you won't fall.

And all this saying is basically pointing out is if your eye isn't working, even though there's a lot of light all around the rest of your body, your whole body is in a sense is in the darkness. If your eye's not working, there's a sense in which there's no other part of your body that can see, or take the light in, and say, so if your eye's not working, your whole body is in darkness. Whether or not the whole room is flooded with light, see.

So you say, and you know, when you're reading this, you say, what's that got to do with anything? In fact, if you look, you say, okay, verses 19 to 21 is all about money. And then verses 24, and following is about money.

What's the saying doing in here? It's a little easier to understand his point. If you go to Luke 11 and 12, and Luke 11 and 12, Jesus uses the same discussion as illustration, the eye is the lamp of the body, if your eye is dark, your whole body is dark.

And he also talks about money, and again, it's connected, and when you get into Luke 12, you see after he talks about the eye and the lamp, he says, so watch out for greed. That's in Luke 12. He says, watch out for greed, watch out for all kinds of greed.

Now, what is he saying? Very interesting. He's saying that greed and materialism, materialism is an inordinate desire or dependence on money and material things, an inordinate desire or dependence on money and material things.

The materialism has the peculiar effect of blinding you spiritually, of distorting the way you see things. It has a power over the way you see everything. Now, what do I mean about it?

All right. Let me give you some examples. First of all, for example, materialism has the power to blind you to materialism.

So what Jesus is saying is very interesting. Let me cast it in this light. Kathy, some years ago, my wife Kathy noticed that I was doing a series of monthly morning breakfast.

I was speaking in a men's breakfast once a month on the seven deadly sins, and you know the seven deadly sins have lust and they have pride and they have envy and they have anger and so forth. And of course, one of the seven deadly sins is greed. And Kathy says, now, are they advertising these things?

I mean, are they saying, here's the subject and then people are bringing their friends and I said, yeah, right. They're advertising. He says, so they'll know when greedy.

The month that you're speaking on greed. I said, right. Watch the attendance is going to drop.

It's just going to go down. They're not going to come out to hear about greed. And she was right.

She was right. It was the worst attendant of all of them. And I thought about that.

Why? Why? I'll tell you why.

It's not that they were hostile. It's not that people said, oh, that's a terrible idea. I don't want to talk about greed.

I want to hear about greed. Oh no. Everybody was just so absolutely sure.

It's not true of them. In other words, see, this is different than the other sins. This is why Jesus says this is an eye sin.

This puts this darkens your eye spiritually. You don't have to say to somebody. Jesus did not say to anybody, watch out.

You might be committing adultery. I mean, if you're committing adultery, you know you're committing adultery. You don't say, oh, you're not my wife.

I mean, it doesn't happen. But Jesus has to say, watch out. You might be greedy.

You see, because greed hides itself, it blinds you in a way that adultery doesn't really. I mean, you know if you're committing adultery. Over the years, as a pastor, I've had people come in to talk to me about sins.

It's a confess sins that come in and say, I want to talk to you about a real problem having something wrong. I haven't confessed as other people, but you're a pastor priest, rabbi type, and I'll tell you about it. And they do, they come and they'll talk about anger, and they'll talk about bitterness, and they'll talk about lust, and they'll talk about pride, and they'll talk about everything.

But I don't think I remember anybody coming to me ever to confess the sin of greed. I don't think anybody came in to say, pastor, I'm materialistic. Never done it, because it has a, now I know what this means is, Jesus is saying, you don't ask.

You don't consider the possibility that you're greedy. You just don't think you are. You just say, me, greedy?

You think of rich, rich people. You think of people that spend tons of, the trouble is you've all got friends. In fact, most of you even have a relative who's much more kind of extravagant with money than you are.

And that's all it takes. All you've got to do is know somebody who's really greedy and you don't even think that you're greedy. You don't even, you wouldn't even consider the possibility that you're materialistic.

You don't even, that's the reason why it didn't come. Not, they were bored. They're bored.

They figured, this isn't, this doesn't apply to me. And you see this, I, if you're there tonight and you say, well, this is not a problem of mine. That's a very bad sign.

This is one of the sins that has the sign, a symptom is that I'm sure it's just not true of me. And therefore, Jesus is saying, watch out. Is this sin of the eye?

It darkens your eye. For example, let me give you some examples of how I can darken your eye. For example, sometimes you choose a job.

Materialism has the power to get you to choose a job. Not one that you love, not one that you're good at, not one that helps people, but one that just makes you money. You do it because it'll get you to a certain status in life.

And you choose the job on the basis of that. You know, for five to 10 years, the adrenaline can keep you going. And then after a while, you just find yourself empty inside.

Why did you choose the job? Your eye was dark. I'm not saying everybody does this, but so many people do.

Or let me give you another example. In the conduct of your job, not only can materialism blind you as you choose your job, in the conduct of your job. For example, many, many, many, many companies, many, many companies are making money, but we all know this.

They're hurting neighborhoods. They're hurting towns. They're hurting people.

We know this. Now, there's all sorts of people in the company. And what are they doing?

Are they saying, ha ha, in order to make money, I am ruining the environment of that little town? Ha ha, no, you're not doing that. What are you doing?

You're not asking. You don't want to go there. You don't ask questions.

You don't want to know. You don't want to think out. You don't want to ask hard questions about is are the deals that my company is making?

Are the things that my company is doing? Is this really helping people? Is it hurting people?

Is it helping the town or is it hurting the town? Is it helping the neighborhood? Is it hurting people?

You don't want to know. You don't want to go. That's the blindness.

That's what Jesus is talking about. Greed doesn't go ha ha. I am, you know, gouging the poor.

No, but are you asking whether your company is? You need to ask that. If you're not even asking that, that means the blind eye, the dark eye.

Do you see that? Or do it one more. Materialism keeps you from asking hard questions about your lifestyle.

Now you see, one of the problems with being professionals. If you are, you know, so many of you are professionals. Now, if you, you know, if you go to the bowling alley, with the other kind of working class people, by and large everybody there's making the same amount of money.

By and large. However, if you're a professional, one of the problems is the kinds of people you come into contact with many, many, many times, sometimes your friends are making 10 times the money you are. Or people you go to parties with, or circles that you get into.

And there's always somebody. Once you've got that little ticket into the professional world, you're constantly rubbing the people you work with. You might have a pretty good job, but here's a person who's three levels above and that person's making 10 times, 50 times what you're making.

And therefore you're sure, at this the reason why, don't forget, the person who is making, that you think that's person's rich, that person's making seven figures. They're hanging out with people who make 10 times more than they do every year. And therefore nobody ever feels rich.

You know, there's probably one or two people that know they're rich, but everybody else makes them feel okay. They probably say I'm rich, you know? But hardly anybody else does.

And you don't ask these questions, do I really need to spend this much money on this? Do I need to be putting this much money into my apartment? Do I need to be spending this much money for my apartment?

Do I, you know, do I need to be spending this much money on clothes? And you say, because you, because you compare, immediately you think of other people who do much more and therefore you don't ask the question, you don't go there, you don't ask. You don't say, wait a minute, isn't there ways in which I could be giving more of my money to the church, to the poor, to my friends, to the neighbors?

Isn't there ways in which I could be much more radical generous if I made this and that and that change? You don't want to ask, you don't want to think. In 1635, I got named Robert Cain, 1635 now.

I was a member of the first congregational church of Boston. And I think back then there probably only was one congregational church in Boston, I don't know. I would think.

And he was doing pretty well as a businessman, but in 1635 his elders disciplined him for the sin of greed. They, I don't think they excommunicated, I think they suspended him from the Lord's sufferer, they admonished him. So his elders disciplined him for the sin of greed.

Now, how do they do that? Is because he was selling his product at a 6% profit. And the church had decided three or four years before that that they were only, Christians were only allowed to sell their wares at a 4% profit.

So when they found out he was doing 6% they disciplined him for the sin of greed. Now some of you are out there saying, where is this illustration going? I'll tell you where it's going.

They realized, now this is not as stupid as it sounds. My wife certainly thought it's not as stupid when I first read it to her, but I'll tell you why it's not. And I convinced her it wasn't.

You know, she said, where is it saying the Bible 4%? What are you talking about? Well, here, now listen, they knew something and that is that when you're committing adultery you know you're committing adultery but when you're being greedy you never know.

And so they sat down as Christians and they said now look, according to the Bible Jesus talks about money all the time. He's constantly saying watch out for greed. He's always saying give your money away.

He's always saying don't spend all your money on yourself. I mean, especially in the book of Luke but all the way through the Gospels, it is frightening. I mean, I can't preach on money as often as Jesus preached on money.

I wouldn't have a church. I mean, you know, everybody gets so quiet. I mean, nobody walks out singing, you know and yet Jesus talked about money all the time.

So this Congressional Church got together and said we got a problem here. Some business practices must be greedy. Some lifestyles have to be greedy but how are we gonna know?

There have to be some. We can't just say well, you know, there have to be some and so they said all right, as a Christian community let's sit down and let's just say at our time in our place in this spot, we can't talk about everything else but let us decide what is a greedy lifestyle, what are greedy business practices and so they got together and by consensus they decided on summit and they said now let us hold each other accountable. So it was mutual, it was consensual, you know, very modern, consensual, everything is okay, but it's consensual and they got together and they made this decision and of course he knew about it but he tried to move past it and therefore he was right, they were right.

Now, I am not saying by any means that today in our economy you could possibly come up when you consider how different every field is you could never come up with a nice simple, I mean that was a whole different world in so many ways. You couldn't come up with a nice simple rule of thumb even if you all got together and said look, we're just gonna do this for ourselves, you couldn't do that. But here's the point, who are you accountable to?

What Christians have gotten together with you and mutually you say let's talk about how we're spending our money on each other on ourselves. How much we're giving away, how much we're keeping what we're doing. Who has, who have you authorized?

What Christians have you authorized to do that and then you're of course authorized to do it with him. You have to talk about with somebody, you've gotta have some standards and you can't trust yourself. That's the principle, you cannot trust yourself to decide this.

And I know what your answer, I know what you're thinking and I know what I'm thinking and that is, I don't even think about that, I don't wanna, I don't want, I don't even wanna think myself about it. When I make, when I spend on money, I don't even wanna sit down myself and think, gee, did I really have to do that? I mean not only don't wanna talk to other people but I don't even talk to myself about it, I just wanna do it.

And that's Jesus' whole point about greed. Money has the power to keep you from asking questions about how you spend your money and how you make your money. Money has the power to keep you from asking questions about how you spend it, how you make it, the hard questions.

Now, why? Why does money have that power? If that's how it has, I mean that's the power of greed.

The power of greed is to not ask. The power of greed is to not think. The power of greed is to say what's not true of me.

We live in the most wealthiest society in a history of the world, especially the last five to 10 years. There's never been, right now at least 70% of the wealth in the whole world is essentially in the hands of about 5% of the people, which is pretty much America. And we are professionals and if you're a professional in this room, that means you're in the top 20% of that 5%.

There's never been a group of people as wealthy as we are. And here, do we dare? Is there anybody in this room that dares to say, I really am doing just fine when it comes to material things.

I couldn't give any more way. I couldn't live any more simply. I couldn't be any more generous with my money.

I'm pretty generous. The rest of the world knows better. The rest of the world looks at us and says to Americans, there's so many things you could be doing in this world.

If you just didn't think you had to have that gadget, there are so many things, the rest of the world sees it. It's astounding that we live in the place we live, in the time we live and we won't even think about the possibility that we're greedy. That shows the power of greed.

It shows the power of money. Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer? Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith?

For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding of what it means to follow Christ. A great resource to start using this summer is the new city catacism devotional. God's truth for our hearts and minds.

This devotional brings the historic catacisms of the Christian Church to life, offering a question to consider for each week of the year. In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catacases, the rich and communal practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers that frame the foundational beliefs of the Christian faith. Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer, and a brief meditation that will challenge and inspire you.

The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller, and Kevin D. Young, as well as historical figures such as Augustine, John Calvin, and Martin Luther. This month, in addition to the new city catacism devotional, we are including a great companion resource, the new city catacism for kids, as our thank you for your gift to help gospel and life share the hope of Christ's love with people all over the world.

So request your copies today at gospelonlife.com slash give. That's gospelonlife.com slash give. Now, here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching.

Now, that's how. Why? I'll be real brief about this.

Why is it? That money has this power. Well, the answer is in the little verse, very famous verse, which Jesus says, where your treasure is, there is your heart also.

What he means by that is this. Money serves the way in which you actually, the place where your heart really rests, is revealed by money. So what it means is, money is a way of getting significance for many of us.

For so many people, I'm not saying it's everybody in this room on this one, because this changes. But Jesus says, for example, one of the reasons why we need so much money, one of the reasons why we spend it on ourselves, one of the reasons we don't give it away like we should, is because of money is our significance. It shows us, for example, the fact that we're able to live in a certain place, the fact that we're able to eat certain places, the fact that we're in certain social circles, the fact that we can dress in a certain way, makes us feel we're important.

And you know, it's true. We have a tendency to do this. The higher up economically we get, we don't just look at other people who are below us economically and say, oh, you're below me economically, we say, you're below me.

You don't see that happening to yourself? I mean, you don't have to be very well off. Middle class people in general feel superior to the poor.

We do. Oh, we give money and we're sorry for the poor, we make pity the poor, but we feel superior to them. And there's no good reason to.

You know, we started the same place that they did with the same parents they had, with the same situation they had. Do you really think it'd be that much better? I don't know.

But we automatically feel, when we feel like we're better economically than somebody else, we feel like we're better. When we're higher caliber or socio-economically, we feel like we're higher caliber. It's so automatic, it's so fast.

And because money is something that many of us take and we say that's my significance. That's what makes me feel important. But on the other hand, for other people, other people are different.

And other people take money and make money their security. See, some people use money for approval, other people use money for control. Some people use money in order to say I feel important.

But many other people say I need money, so I'm safe. Don't forget what I'm saying here. I'm asking this question.

If you're not giving your money away in eye-popping proportions, if you find it very difficult, if you're not so radically generous of the world's amazed at the Christians and most of us are not. Why? One answer is, why has it had that power?

One answer is, it's money is your significance, the other possibilities, money is your security. In other words, you feel like if I got money, then I have control in an uncontrollable world. I have control over my life, I have control.

You know, I've got, if things come along, I'm safe. And Jesus Christ says, running after these things cannot add a minute, an hour. They can't add a minute to your life.

It's God who's in control of these things. Money is not going to turn you into God. God, money is not going to be able to get one little bit of control.

One of my professors, Addison Leach, who was the second husband, he died of Elizabeth Elliot. Elizabeth Elliot, who came here last week. Some of you saw, met her, went to her conference.

And she had two husbands die on her before she is now married to third time. Her second husband was a professor of mine and I heard him once tell the story. And he said, he was thinking about this idea that money can be your security.

He had a couple of young women in his, a couple of young women that where he was a teacher at college became Christians in college, and they came back to their parents. And they said, we've become Christians and we want to be missionaries. And the parents said, oh no, missionaries.

And they said, look, each of them said, now dear, you've had a religious experience. How wonderful. But you need some security.

Before you go off to take your, have your missionary experience, which is fine, if you want to go, that's fine. But first we want you to have a master's degree. We want you to have taken a job or two, so you've got some records, so you've gotten your career off the ground.

And we want you to have some money in the bank for some security. And they came back to my professor, Dr. Leach, and they said, what do we say about that?

And Dr. Leach said, oh, here's what I would say to my dear parents. Tell them, we're on a little ball of rock spinning through space.

It's called Earth. And who knows if we're going to run into something, but even if we don't someday, under each one of us is going to open a trap door. And everybody's going to fall off.

I mean, at the end of your life, a trap door opens up underneath you, and you fall off a little ball of rock, and underneath will be the everlasting arms or nothing at all. And you think a master's degree is going to give you some security. Let's see.

And that's what Jesus is saying right here. He says, the power of money is, it seems like it can give you significance, but actually when you make money, you're significant, you become an arrogant person that nobody likes. And you think money can give you some security, but the fact is that money can't possibly stop all the things.

It can't stop death, it can't stop tragedy, it can't stop broken relationships, it can't stop anything. So how do we break the power of money in our lives? Well, the answer is this.

How do we get to the place where we're really radically generous? How do we get to the place where we're not worrying about money? How do we get to the place where we're not, we don't feel, you know, there's a lot of ways in which money controls us.

Let's take a look. Verse 19. Do not stir up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, where these break in and steal, but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where these do not break in and steal.

Now, literally, he says, don't treasure earthly treasures, but treasure heavenly treasure. That's what he says. And that's important to know, everybody at the center of their soul has something they treasure.

What does it mean to treasure something? It means to look at something, fill your heart with a beauty and the value of it, and to treasure something is to say, if I have this, everything's worth it. If I have this, it's all worth it.

And if I have this, I'm worth it. In other words, everybody's got something. It might be money, it might be career, it might be status, it might be romance, it might be a family, you're looking at it and it's your treasure.

And you say, if I could have this, it'll all be worth it. Everybody in this room's got something, something on earth they're doing that about. Everybody, if I had this, it would all be worth it.

And then I'd be worth it. My favorite fantasy book, Lord of the Rings, which I've been rereading recently, it's all about the special ring, and it's beautiful, and whoever owns it, calls it the precious. Any of you ever read Lord of the Rings?

Everybody who gets this ring, in a sense comes under its power, because you look at it, and everybody who gets it calls it my precious, the precious. And that's what Jesus is saying, is at the center of everybody's soul, there's the precious, something that you've looked at, and you said, this is precious to me. This is the thing that if I have, it's all worth it.

This is the thing that if I have it, then I'm worth it. You've got something. But whatever that is, you are enslaved to it.

Anything that your soul treasures, once your soul treasures something, you will pay any price for it. You will do anything to get it, because it's the only thing that's worth it. See?

Now, the Bible says, every treasure but Jesus will insist that you die to purchase it. But Jesus himself is the one treasure who died to purchase you. Anything else you make your supreme value, will say, die for me.

But if you make Jesus Christ your supreme value, he's the one who said, I've died for you. How do you make Jesus Christ your treasure? Only if you make him your treasure.

Only if he is your heavenly treasure. Only if you treasure him. Well, you actually be in a sense free from money.

Now, I'll explain what that means in a second. But first, how can you treasure Jesus? Think about what he did with his treasure.

He had the ultimate treasure. He was the Lord. He had the ultimate status.

And he also had the ultimate security. He was the Son. That was the Father.

But when he came to earth, what happened to him on the cross? He was utterly stripped. When he was stripped naked of all of his belongings and all of his possessions, that was just an echo of the fact that he was spiritually stripped.

He lost all of his treasure. Why? He died for something.

Now, you only die for that, which is your precious. And what this means is, Jesus Christ must have looked at us. And must have said, if I have them, even going to hell, will be worth it.

And Isaiah chapter 53 tells us by prophecy that when he saw the results of his suffering, he was satisfied. Now, you know, in 1 Peter 2.9, it says, you are a chosen race. He's talking to the Christians.

You are a holy nation. You are a royal priesthood. You are God's purchased possession.

That means you are his treasure. Unless you know that he was willing to lose all his treasure so that you could be his treasure. Unless you realize that he looked at you and he felt towards you like that.

That he felt if I have them, anything's worth. Nothing would be worth losing them. Anything would be worth saving them.

You know that he treasures you. You know he cares about you like that. That and that alone will free you.

Absolutely free you from money. It'll free you from everything. It won't just free you from money.

And here's what I mean by free you from money. Some of you, here's a test. Here's one of the ways you know that you have spiritual wealth.

How do you react to rich people? I'll tell you how most of us do it. Many of you resent rich people.

You feel disdainful of them. You say look at their money. Look at their homes.

Look at all this stuff. And you feel superior to them. And that shows that money still has power over you.

If you dislike rich people, if you feel superior to rich people, that shows money still got power over you. It shows a lack of spiritual wealth in you. It shows actually a lack of humility.

And the gospel is your center. So you haven't really received it. However, if you envy rich people, if you can't believe that this person has let me come into this room and into this apartment.

Look how neat this is. Isn't this incredible? See, that also shows that money's got power over you.

The gospel is you're more sinful than you ever dared believe. You're more loved than you ever dared hope. The more sinful keeps you from feeling superior to rich people.

The more loved keeps you from feeling inferior to rich people. And therefore, the gospel puts you in a place where you really don't care about money anymore. And the best way to see that money had no longer has any power over you is that you can love rich people.

Secondly, the way you can tell that money has no more power over you is that you also respect for people. That you looked at them and you respect them and you expect to learn from them and you don't look down your nose at them. And boy, that's mighty, mighty, mighty hard.

But by and large, there's a tendency, you know, money still has power over us because we very often we get around poor people. We just really look down our nose at them. You know, you rub, this is New York, fortunately.

And in New York, you actually actually do ride subways with poor people. And you see poor people. I mean, you know, the rest of the country, we just keep, we just get them away.

We just get them away. We zone them away. In New York, you can't zone people away.

Thank you. That's great, New York. In some ways, New York is more like the new Jerusalem.

A lot of people are going to hate the New Jerusalem because they hate New York. There's not going to be any zoning there. And one of the good things is you are around poor people.

How do you respond to them? One of the ways you can see that money has lost its power over you because of the gospel of Jesus, because you know that he lost all of his treasure to make you his treasure. That humbles you, that melts you, that lifts you up.

And one of the ways you'll know is that you no longer, you have no trouble loving rich people. Secondly, you have no trouble loving poor people. But the third, the third sign that money no longer has power over your life is this.

You get really generous. You know what's interesting? Verse 22, the eyes, the lamp of the body, if your eyes are good, if your eyes are good, that word actually is a double meaning in Greek.

The word good also means generous. And a Christian who's really been freed from money by finding Jesus is their treasure gets a generous eye. You're always looking and always looking for opportunities.

You're looking at your friends, your neighbors, your looking at your church, you're looking at the poor, you're looking at your city. And you're always looking for ways to give away. You want to say, well, how much?

This is the last thing I'll say. Well, you have to look at what Jesus did. When Jesus treasured you, he treasured you sacrificially.

Now, if you want to respond to Jesus, that means that I have got to not just simply live out the cross of Jesus Christ in my relationships, I've also got to live out the cross of Jesus Christ economically. Now follow me here. You know, most every Christian says, oh, I'm a Christian.

And therefore, I need to, Jesus died for me and he lived a sacrificial life for me. And therefore, I have to love others as Christ loved me. Fine.

That means you have got to give enough money away this year that it sacrifices your lifestyle. If you give money, but it doesn't really cut into the way in which you live, it doesn't sacrifice. There's no cross in your economic life.

If you don't give enough away enough money so that it really makes a difference in how you live your life, in your lifestyle, then there's no cross. And you're not really responding to Jesus as he's responded to you. Now, for most of us, I'll tell you this, not yet, for most people, I shouldn't say of us.

For most people, most places in most times in the world, the tithe is the goal. Why? Because most places, most times, most people, the Bible says, give away 10%, that's a good, nice figure to think about in terms of your giving.

That's a good way to tell whether or not the gospel is working in your heart. Because if the gospel is working in your heart and you see what Jesus Christ has done for you, it doesn't seem like much. I mean, after all, what if Jesus had tithes as blood, you still be lost.

I mean, Jesus went way past the tithe. So the point is 10% doesn't seem like very much. However, for most people, it does mean a sacrifice.

There'll be a cross in the 10% for most of us. For most of us, 10% is really going to be hard. It's going to hurt.

But increasingly in America, there are people for whom 10% does not make a dent. And you see, the 10% is not the point. The Bible tells you how much I be giving away.

The 10% is just a rule of thumb. It's just a helping, a good way to get started. The cross is the standard.

The 10% is just sort of an example for most of us. But the cross is the standard. Is there a cross in your life?

In your economic life. If Jesus is your treasure, you'll love the rich. If Jesus is your treasure, you'll love the poor.

If Jesus is the treasure, you'll be giving your money away joyfully, deliberately, happily. That's the reason why the early church was so successful. We have an old letter from Diagnetus, who talked about the early Christians.

Why they were so popular and why they stunned people. He says, we share our table with all, but we do not share our bed with all. He said, in other words, the pagans are promiscuous with their body, but very stingy with their money.

And Christians are very stingy with their body and incredibly promiscuous with their money. Which kind of person benefited their neighborhood? In other words, would you want to live in a neighborhood?

I said this last week, I think. Would you want to live in a neighborhood with a group of people who are stingy with their money? And very promiscuous with their body?

What impact would that have on the neighborhood? If you're a child, where do you want to live? Do you want to live in a neighborhood of people like that?

Or do you want to live in a neighborhood of people? Who practice sexual integrity and financial promiscuity? A city filled with that kind of person is going to be a healthy city.

A neighborhood filled with that kind of person is going to be a healthy neighborhood. There are tremendous public ramifications of the Sermon on the Mount. Let's live it.

Let's pray. Our Father, I thank You for giving us this time to consider what it means to treasure up treasures in heaven. We thank You for what Your Son did for us.

We thank You for all of that. And we pray that You would help it become such a reality in our lives that money no longer has power over us. The intimidation we feel around people who have more money, or the inferiority we feel, or even the anger we feel, or the superiority we feel.

Oh, Lord, change that so that we are very different kinds of people. We are unique people. You've done it in the past.

The early church really understood this. Let it be true of us, too. We pray in Jesus' name.

Amen. Thanks for joining us here on the Gospel and Life Podcast. We hope that today's teaching encouraged you to go deeper into God's Word.

**讲员**: 提摩太·凯勒 (Tim Keller)


欢迎来到《福音与生活》播客。本月我们将推出一系列关于“登山宝训”的节目，这是耶稣阐述基督徒生活的真正含义的一系列教导。在这个系列中，提摩太·凯勒探讨了一个引人深思的观点：基督教不仅不同于世界，它还从根本上不同于宗教。请看你们的会刊，今天的教义基于这一段经文，我们正在研读“登山宝训”，现在我们要来看看耶稣关于金钱和财产的看法，他有很多话要说。

让我们一起阅读马太福音6章的内容： > “不要为自己积攒财宝在地上，地上有虫子咬，有贼挖窟窿来偷；只要积存财宝在天上，天上没有虫子咬，也没有贼挖窟窿来偷。因为哪里有你的财宝，你的心也必在哪里。” 眼睛是身体的灯。“你的眼睛好，全身就光明；你的眼睛不好，全身就黑暗。

如果你的眼睛是黑暗的，那么你全身就是黑暗了。既然你们里面是黑暗的，那黑暗又是多么深重啊！没有人能侍奉两个主人。他不是恨这个爱那个，就是忠于这个轻视那个。

你们不能同时侍奉神和金钱。” 因此，我告诉你们不要为明天忧虑，要忧虑今天的事就够了；也不要为身体忧虑，要忧虑衣服的事就够了。难道生命的价值还不如食物吗？难道身体的重要性还不如衣服吗？

看看天上的飞鸟吧，它们不卖也不种，也不积存粮食在谷仓里，而你们的天父尚且供养它们，更何况是你们呢！你们岂不是比它们更有价值吗？谁会因为忧虑而多活一小时呢？为什么你们还为衣服担忧呢？

看看田野里的百合花吧，它们不劳作也不纺纱。我告诉你们，连所罗门王的荣华还不如这些百合花中的一朵。如果神这样照顾田间的草，今天还在明天就扔在火里，他岂会不更顾念你们吗？哦，你们这小信的人啊！

所以你们不要为吃喝忧虑，说什么我们吃什么，喝什么；也不要为衣服忧虑，说什么穿什么。因为外邦人就是这样运行，你们的天父也知道你们需要这些。但你们首先要追求他的国和他的义，这些东西自然就加给你们了。所以不要为明天忧虑，因为明天自有明天的忧虑。

神的言语说：今天有今天的难处。现在登山宝训讲的是，如果我们真接受耶稣基督福音的核心信息，并在生活中实践它，那会是什么样子？这就是登山宝训要探讨的内容。我们现在进入关于金钱和财产的部分，金钱和财产。

耶稣在这里告诉我们三件事。他告诉我们金钱如何控制我们，金钱对我们有怎样的力量，以及它是如何行使这种力量的。首先，金钱是如何行使它的力量的。对于解释者或试图理解这段经文的人来说，这里有一个有趣的比喻，就是关于眼睛的小说法。

它说：“眼睛是身体的灯，如果你的眼睛好，全身就光明；如果你的眼睛不好，全身就黑暗。”**这意味着非常简单的事情。**我们在这间房间里，房间有光。如果眼睛能工作，意味着它可以接收光线，那么你就能靠这光在房间里移动。

你会知道哪里是哪里，不会绊倒也不会摔倒。这段话基本上就是在说，如果你的眼睛不好使，即使周围有很多光，你的身体整体上也可以说是处于黑暗之中。如果眼睛不好使，其他部位就无法接收到光线，也无法感知光明。因此，如果眼睛不好使，你的整个身体都是在黑暗中的。

所以你可能会想：这和任何事情有什么关系呢？事实上，当你读到这里时，你会发现从第19节到第21节都在讲金钱的问题；而从第24节开始一直到后面的内容也都在讲金钱。这段话里提到的比喻是怎么回事呢？在路加福音11章和12章中，耶稣用同样的讨论来做说明。

眼睛是身体的灯，如果眼睛不好使，你的整个身体也就不好使了。他还提到了金钱，并且这些内容是相关的。当你进入路加福音12章时，你会发现，在他谈到眼睛和灯之后，他说要小心贪婪。在路加福音12章中，耶稣说：“小心贪婪，小心各种各样的贪婪。

” 那么，他在说什么呢？非常有趣的是，他在说贪婪和物质主义的问题。物质主义是指对金钱和物质东西的过度欲望或依赖。这种物质主义有特殊的功效，能够蒙蔽你的灵性视野，扭曲你看待事物的方式，并且控制你看待一切的方式。

那么我具体是什么意思呢？让我给你举几个例子。首先，物质主义有力量使你忽视物质主义本身。所以耶稣的话非常有趣。

让我这样来表达：凯茜几年前注意到我在每个月的男性早餐会上做一次关于七宗罪的演讲。我每月都在一个男性的早餐会上讲解七宗罪中的贪欲等罪行。当然，七宗罪之一就是贪婪。凯茜说：“现在他们在打广告吗？

” 我意思是，他们说这个主题，然后带朋友来听。我说，对吧？他们在做广告。他说，这样他们就知道什么时候会有人来。

你们在讲贪婪的那个月。我说，对吧。看看出席人数要下降了。它只会下降。

人们不会出来听关于贪婪的事。她是对的。她是对的，那是所有场次中最差的一次。我一直在想这件事。

为什么？为什么？告诉你原因。他们不是敌对的。

没有人说，哦，那是个糟糕的想法。我不想谈论贪婪。我想听听贪婪。不，每个人都那么肯定。

这并不是他们的错。换句话说，这就是与其他罪的不同之处。这也是耶稣说这是眼中的罪的原因。这使你灵里变暗了。

你不需要告诉某人，耶稣没有对任何人说过，小心，你可能在犯通奸罪。意思是，如果你真的在犯通奸罪，你自己知道你在犯通奸罪。你不会说，哦，我不是她丈夫。这根本就不会发生。

但耶稣必须说，小心，你可能在贪婪。你看，因为贪婪会隐藏自己，它以一种通奸无法做到的方式蒙蔽了你。意思是，你知道如果你在犯通奸罪。多年以来，作为牧师，我见过人们来找我说他们有罪的问题。

他们会来忏悔并说，我想和你谈谈一个**真正的问题，有些事情不对劲。我没有像其他人那样去忏悔，但你是**牧师、祭司或拉比，我会告诉你。他们会谈论愤怒，谈论苦毒，谈论淫欲，谈论骄傲，谈论一切。但我认为我从未见过有人来找我说他们有贪婪的罪。

我认为没有人来对我说，牧师，我是物质主义者。从没做过，因为**这意味着耶稣在说，你不会问自己。**你不会考虑你自己可能在贪婪。你只是不觉得自己在贪婪。

你会说，我贪婪？你想到那些富有的、非常有钱的人。你们觉得他们花很多钱，但问题在于你们都有朋友，甚至有很多亲戚比你更爱花钱。而这只需要一点点。

你只要认识一个特别贪婪的人，你自己都不会觉得自己很贪婪，甚至不会认为自己是物质主义者。这就是为什么它没有影响到你。不是因为他们无聊，而是他们感到厌烦了。他们觉得这与自己无关。

你看这种情况，如果你今晚在这里说，这不是我的问题，那是一个非常不好的迹象。这是一个罪行的标志之一，就是你觉得它肯定不适用于你自己。因此，耶稣说要小心。这是“眼中的淫念”吗？

它会蒙蔽你的眼睛。让我给你举几个例子说明它是如何蒙蔽你的。比如，有时候你会选择一份工作。物质主义有能力让你选择一份工作，不是你喜欢的工作，也不是你能胜任的工作，更不是能帮助人的工作，而是一份能赚大钱的工作。

你之所以选择这份工作是因为它能让你在社会中达到一定的地位。你知道的，在头五到十年里，肾上腺素可以支撑你继续前进。但过了一段时间后，你会发现内心空虚。为什么你会选择那份工作？

因为你的“眼”被蒙蔽了。我不是说每个人都会这样，但很多人确实如此。或者让我再举一个例子。在工作中，物质主义不仅会蒙蔽你在选择工作时的判断，在你工作的过程中也会蒙蔽你。

比如，许多公司赚了很多钱，但我们都知道它们是在伤害社区、小镇和人们。现在，公司里有很多人。他们都在做什么？他们会说：“为了赚钱，我正在破坏那个小城镇的环境？

”哈哈，不，你们不会这么做。那他们在干什么？他们不去问这些问题。你不想知道。

你不想去思考。你不想问那些难堪的问题：我的公司正在做的交易是什么？他们在做的事情对人们有帮助吗？还是在伤害他们？

这对小镇有好处，还是在伤害它？对邻里有好处，还是在伤害人？你不想知道。你不愿意面对现实。

这就是一种盲从。耶稣正是在谈论这种现象。贪婪并不是什么好笑的事情：我在剥削穷人。不是的，但你是否问过你的公司是不是这样呢？

你需要去问这个问题。如果你连这个问题都不问，那说明你的眼睛是蒙蔽的，是黑暗的。你看出来了吗？还是再举一个例子吧。

物质主义让你无法对自己的生活方式提出尖锐的问题。现在你知道了，作为专业人士的一个问题：你们当中有很多人都是专业人士。当你和其他工人阶级的人去保龄球馆时，大多数人的收入都差不多。然而，如果你是一名专业人士，你会经常接触到一些人，他们中的很多人赚的钱是你的十倍甚至更多。

你参加聚会或者进入的社交圈里也常常会遇到这样的人。一旦你进入了专业领域，你就总是和这些同事打交道。虽然你可能有一份不错的工作，但总有人职位比你高得多，他们的收入可能是你的十倍、五十倍。因此，你会觉得这是理所当然的：那个收入看起来很高的人，他们一年赚上百万甚至更多，而他们身边的人每年赚的钱是他们的十倍以上。

所以没有人觉得自己富有。你知道，可能只有那么一两个人知道自己很富有，但其他人让他们感觉还不错。他们可能会说：“我觉得自己很有钱。”但实际上几乎没有人这么认为。

你明白了吗？你不会问自己，我真的需要花这么多钱吗？我真的需要把这么多钱投入到我的公寓里吗？我真的需要花这么多钱买衣服吗？

你会想，因为一比较，你就想到别人做得更多，所以你就不再问这个问题了。你不想说，等等，我是不是可以更慷慨地把更多的钱捐给教会、穷人、朋友和邻居呢？我不是在想我可以变得多慷慨，如果我做出一些改变呢？你不想思考，也不想质疑。

1635年，我的名字叫罗伯特·凯恩。1635年，我是波士顿第一联合教堂的成员。我想那时候可能只有这一家联合教堂吧，我不确定。但那时他做生意做得还不错，但是1635年他的长老们因为贪婪之罪对他进行了纪律处分。

我认为他们没有开除他，而是暂停了他的圣餐资格，并且告诫了他。现在他们是怎么做的呢？因为他们发现他卖货的利润是6%，而教会几年前已经决定基督徒只能以4%的利润率销售商品。所以当他们发现他的利润率是6%时，就因为贪婪之罪对他进行了纪律处分。

现在你们中有些人可能在想，这个例子要往哪里发展？我来告诉你它的发展方向。他们意识到这一点并不像听起来那么愚蠢。我妻子第一次读到这段话时也觉得不怎么聪明，但我告诉她原因后，她同意了。

你知道吗，她说：“圣经上哪有说4%？”你在说什么呀？好吧，现在听我说，他们知道一件事——那就是你犯通奸罪的时候知道自己在犯通奸罪，但当你贪婪的时候却不知道自己在做什么。于是他们作为基督徒坐下来，说现在看，根据圣经，耶稣经常提到金钱。

他总是警告要提防贪婪。他总是在说要捐出你的钱。他总是在说不要把所有的钱都花在自己身上。我意思是，尤其是在路加福音中，但整本福音书里都是这样。

这真是令人害怕。我真不敢像耶稣那样经常讲金钱的事。没有教会我也行。我意思是，大家都会安静下来。

没有人会走掉边唱边走。但我却看到耶稣总是谈论金钱。所以这个国会教堂聚在一起说，我们这里有个问题。有些商业行为可能是贪婪的。

有些生活方式也必须是贪婪的。但我们怎么知道呢？肯定有。我们不能光说一定有。

于是他们说好吧，在作为基督徒社区的时候，让我们坐下来讨论一下，在我们的时代、地点和位置上，我们可以不谈论其他一切，但让我们决定什么是贪婪的生活方式，什么是贪婪的商业行为。所以他们聚在一起，通过协商做出了决定，并且说现在让我们互相监督。所以这是相互的，是经过协商的，很现代，协商一致，一切都好，但它是协商一致的，他们聚在一起做了这个决定，当然他知道这件事，但他试图忽略它，所以他就是对的，他们也是对的。现在我并不是说在我们今天的经济中，你们能够制定出一个简单明确的规定。

考虑到每个领域都不同，你根本不可能制定出一条简单的规则。那是一个完全不同的世界，在很多方面。即使你们所有人聚在一起说，我们就这么做吧，你也做不到这一点。但关键在于，你向谁负责？

基督徒们坐下来和你一起讨论，互相说我们要怎么花自己的钱，给自己多少钱，捐出多少钱，保留多少钱，做什么。你们授权给了谁？基督徒们，你们授权给谁去做这些事，当然也就授权给你们自己。你们必须和某个人谈谈，必须有一些标准，不能完全依赖自己来做决定。

这就是原则：你不能信任自己来做出这样的判断。我知道你们的想法，我也知道我在想什么——我根本不想这么想。当我花钱时，我真的不想自己坐下来思考：“我真的需要这样做吗？”不仅不和别人讨论，甚至也不和自己讨论，只想直接去做。

这就是耶稣关于贪婪的整个观点。金钱有力量让你不去问你在如何花钱、如何赚钱的问题。金钱有力量让你不去问你如何花费它、如何赚取它，那些难堪的问题。那么，为什么会有这样的力量？

如果这是贪婪的力量，那就是贪婪的力量。贪婪的力量在于不提问。贪婪的力量在于不想思考。贪婪的力量在于说谎，说那不是真实的自己。

我们生活在一个历史上最富裕的社会中，尤其是在过去的五到十年里。目前至少有70%的世界财富掌握在大约5%的人手中，而这些人主要是美国人。我们是专业人士，在这个房间里如果你们是专业人士，那就意味着你们属于这5%中的前20%。从来没有一个群体像我们这样富有。

那么，我们敢吗？在这个房间里有没有人敢于说：“我确实对物质生活感到满意。” 我真的不能再简朴了。我真的不能再更慷慨地使用我的钱了。

我很慷慨。全世界的人都知道这一点。全世界的人看着美国人说：你们这个世界上有那么多事情可以去做。如果你只是觉得不需要那个小玩意儿，其实世界上还有很多其他东西在盯着你。

我们生活在这个时代、这个地方，竟然还会觉得自己不贪婪，这恰恰显示了贪婪的力量。这也显示出金钱的力量。这个夏天，你们有没有想过要如何提升自己的信仰？或者有没有想要帮助新信徒或孩子们理解基督教的核心？

对很多人来说，夏季是一个可以更多地深入信仰和了解跟随基督的意义的好时机。今年夏天开始使用的一个很好的资源就是“城市灾难”灵修手册。这本灵修手册能为我们的内心和头脑带来上帝的真理。这个灵修手册将历史上基督教教会的重大事件生动呈现出来，每星期提供一个问题供我们思考。

在引言中，提摩太·凯勒阐述了为什么我们要重视这些灾难，以及这种富有社区性的学习和记忆问答的方式如何构成了基督教信仰的基础。每个星期包括一段圣经经文、一篇祷告和一段简短的冥想，这将挑战并激励你。附带的注释由许多当代牧师如约翰·派博、提摩太·凯勒和凯文·D·杨以及历史人物如奥古斯丁、约翰·加尔文和马丁·路德撰写。这个月，除了“城市灾难”灵修手册之外，我们还为你们准备了一个很好的配套资源——“城市灾难”儿童版，作为对你们捐赠的感谢，帮助福音和生命向全世界的人们分享基督之爱。

所以，请今天就到gospelonlife.com/give预订你的副本。现在，提摩太·凯勒将为我们带来今天的余下部分教导。为什么是这样呢？我简单说一下。

为什么金钱会有这样的力量呢？答案就在耶稣的一句著名的话中：“你们的财宝在哪里，你的心也在哪里。”他所说的含义是：金钱揭示了我们心灵真正安息的地方。也就是说，对很多人来说，金钱是我们获得意义的一种方式。

对于很多人来说，我不是说你们所有人在这个房间里都这样，因为情况会变化。但耶稣说，例如，我们为什么需要这么多钱、为什么花在自己身上、为什么不像应该的那样捐出去，其中一个原因是因为金钱是我们价值所在。它让我们觉得，比如我们有能力住在某个地方，有能力吃某种食物，能够在某些社交圈子里，能够以某种方式打扮，都让我们觉得自己很重要。你知道吗，确实如此。

我们有这种倾向。经济地位越高的人，并不只是看那些经济地位低于自己的人说：“你比我经济地位低。”我们会说：“你比不上我。” 你自己有没有注意到这一点？

也就是说，你不需要非常富有。中产阶级普遍感觉自己比穷人优越。我们就是这样。哦，我们给钱并为穷人感到抱歉，我们同情穷人，但我们觉得自己比他们优越。

这其实没有好的理由。你知道吗，我们都从同样的起点开始，有相同的父母和相同的情况。你觉得会好很多吗？我不知道。

但当我们觉得在经济上比别人高时，我们会自动感觉更好。当我们处于较高的社会经济地位时，我们会感觉自己更高贵。这种感觉是如此自然，如此迅速。因为金钱是我们很多人认为自己的价值所在，让我们觉得自己很重要。

但另一方面，对其他人来说，情况不同。有些人用钱来获得认可，有些人用钱来控制，有些人用钱来证明自己很重要。但许多人说：“我需要钱，所以我才有安全感。”别忘了我现在说的话。

我在问这个问题。如果你没有以令人震惊的数额施舍钱财，如果你发现这非常困难，如果你不是如此慷慨以至于世界都为之惊讶，而大多数基督徒都不是这样。为什么呢？一个答案是：金钱为何会有这样的力量？

其中一个答案是因为你认为金钱代表了你的价值，另一个可能是因为你觉得金钱能给你安全感。换句话说，你觉得如果我有了钱，就能在不可控的世界中掌控一切，在我的生活中拥有控制权。如果事情来临，我就安全了。你知道，耶稣基督说，追求这些事物并不能为你增加一分钟或一小时的生命。

是上帝掌控着这一切。金钱无法让你变成上帝，也无法给你一点点的控制力。我的一位教授艾德森·里奇曾说过，他是伊丽莎白·埃利的第二任丈夫，在他去世后她又嫁给了第三任。伊丽莎白·埃利上周来这儿了，有些人见到了她，参加了她的会议。

在她之前，已经有两位丈夫相继离世。她的第二任丈夫是我的一位教授，我曾听他讲过这个故事。他说，他在思考金钱可以给人安全感的想法。当时有几位年轻的女性在他大学任教时成为基督徒，并回到父母身边。

她们说，我们已经成了基督徒，想要去做传教士。父母们却说：“不行，你们不能去当传教士。” 然后她们说：“亲爱的，你经历了一次宗教体验，真是太棒了。但我们希望你能有一些安全感。

” 在你们去进行传教之前，如果你们想去的话，那是很好的选择。但在那之前，我们希望你们能先拿到硕士学位，找一份或两份工作，积累一些记录，为自己的职业生涯打下基础。而且我们要在银行里给你们存些钱作为安全保障。她们回来问我的教授莱奇博士：“我们应该怎么跟父母说呢？

” 莱奇博士回答说：“我会这样告诉亲爱的父母们：我们生活在一个小小的岩石星球上，在太空中旋转。” 它叫做地球。谁知道将来会不会遇到什么，但即使有一天不会遇到，每个人脚下都会打开一个陷阱门，然后大家都将从这个小岩石球上掉下去。也就是说，在你生命的尽头，脚下会突然打开一个陷阱门，你就会从这个岩石球上掉下来，下面要么是永恒的臂膀，要么什么都没有。

你以为硕士学位能给你带来安全感吗？让我们看看吧。耶稣在这里正是这么说的：金钱的力量在于它似乎可以赋予人意义，但实际上当你赚到钱时，你会变得自大而没有人喜欢；你以为金钱能给你带来安全感，但事实上金钱根本无法阻止一切。它不能阻止死亡，不能阻止悲剧，不能阻止破裂的关系，什么都不能。

那么我们如何在生命中打破金钱的魔力呢？答案是这样的： 我们怎样才能达到真正慷慨大方的地步？我们怎样才能不再为钱担忧？我们怎样才能不再感到被金钱控制？

让我们来看看第19节：不要为自己在地上积聚财宝，地上有虫子和锈蚀破坏，有贼来偷窃；要积聚在天上，天上没有虫子和锈蚀破坏，也没有贼来偷窃。他实际上说的是，不要珍藏地上的财富，而要珍藏天上的财富。这就是他说的。这一点很重要，因为每个人内心深处都有他们所珍视的东西。

什么是珍视？就是看到某样东西时，在心中充满它的美丽与价值，并且珍视它意味着说：如果我拥有这个，一切都值得；如果我拥有这个，一切就都值得了。换句话说，每个人都有一些东西。可能是金钱，可能是事业，可能是地位，可能是爱情，可能是家庭，你看着它，这就是你的珍宝。

And你说，如果我能拥有这个，一切就都值得了。房间里每个人都有些什么呢？都在地上做着什么。每个人都会说，如果有这个，一切就都值得了。

然后我就值得了。我最喜欢的幻想小说《魔戒》，最近又在重读，它讲的就是那个特别的戒指，非常美丽，谁拥有它，就叫它宝贝。你们中有谁读过《魔戒》吗？拿到这枚戒指的人，在某种意义上都会被它的力量所控制，因为你看它，每个人拿到它都说这是我的宝贝，宝贝。

耶稣说的正是这个意思：在每个人的内心深处，都有一个宝贝，你曾经看过，说过这是我宝贵的。有了这个东西，一切就都值得了。有了这个东西，我就值得了。你们都有些什么。

但无论是什么，你们都在为它所奴役。任何你灵魂珍视的东西，一旦你的灵魂珍视某样东西，你就会不惜一切代价去追求它，你会为了得到它做任何事，因为它是你唯一认为值得的东西。你看？圣经说，除了耶稣之外的每一个宝贝都会要求你为之付出生命。

但耶稣自己是那个为你而死的宝贝。任何其他事物如果你把它当作最高价值，那它也会说要你为它而死。但是如果你把耶稣基督当作你的最高价值，他就是说过“我为你死了”的那个人。你怎么才能让耶稣基督成为你的宝贝呢？

只有当你让他成为你的宝贝时。只有当他成为你天上的宝贝时。只有当你珍视他的时候。那么在某种意义上，你实际上可以摆脱金钱的束缚。

现在我马上解释**这意味着什么。**但首先，你怎么能珍视耶稣呢？想想他用他的宝贝做了些什么。他拥有最宝贵的宝贝。

他是主，拥有最高的地位。他也拥有最安全的地位。他是子，是父的。但他来到地上后，在十字架上发生了什么事？

他被彻底剥夺了。当他被剥得一丝不挂，失去了所有的财产和所有的东西时，那只是他在灵性上被剥夺的一个回响。他失去了所有的宝贝。为什么？

因为他为某事而死。现在，你只愿意为那些你视为珍贵的东西而死。**这意味着耶稣基督一定看过我们，并说过，即使我去地狱，只要能有他们，也是值得的。**以赛亚书第五十三章通过预言告诉我们，当祂看到自己受苦的结果时，祂是满意的。

在彼得前书二章九节中，它说你们是被拣选的族类。祂是在跟基督徒说话。你们是圣洁的国度，是属神的祭司，是祂所买的产业。**这意味着你是祂的珍宝。**

除非你知道祂愿意失去所有的珍宝，好让你成为祂的珍宝。除非你意识到祂看过你，并对你有那样的感情。祂觉得如果我有他们，任何事都值得。没有什么比失去他们更值得。

没有什么比救赎他们更值得。你知道祂珍惜你，关心你就像这样。只有这一点，才能真正地让你从金钱中解脱出来。它会彻底地把你从一切束缚中解放出来。

不仅仅是从金钱的束缚中。这就是我说的“从金钱中解脱”的意思。你们当中有些人，这里有一个测试。有一种方式可以知道你拥有属灵财富。

当你看到富有的人时，你会有什么反应？我可以告诉你大多数人的反应是什么。很多人对富人感到不满。你会对他们感到鄙视。

你会说：“看看他们的钱。看看他们的房子。看看所有这些东西。” 你会觉得自己比他们优越。

这表明金钱仍然对你有影响力。如果你厌恶富人，如果你觉得你比他们优越，这就显示了金钱仍然在你心中占有一席之地。这也显示出你在属灵财富方面有所欠缺。实际上也显示出你的谦卑不够。

福音是你的中心。所以你还没有真正接受它。然而，如果你嫉妒富人，如果你无法相信这个人能走进这个房间和公寓，看看这多整洁，这多么不可思议。这同样显示了金钱对你仍有影响力。

福音告诉你：你比你敢想象的更罪恶。你比你敢希望的更受爱。更多的罪恶感会让你不再觉得比富人优越。更多爱能让你不再觉得自己比富人低贱，因此福音会让你不再在乎金钱。

你真正能感受到金钱对你已无控制力的最佳方式就是你能去爱富人。其次，你可以看出金钱对你已失去控制力的方式是，你也尊重他人。你看他们时会尊敬他们，并期望向他们学习，而不是看不起他们。这可真难做到啊！

不过总的来说，我们都有个倾向，你知道的，金钱仍然对我们有掌控力，因为我们常常避开穷人，对他们不屑一顾。幸好这里是纽约。在纽约，你确实会坐地铁和穷人在一起，你会见到穷人。而在其他地方，我们总是想办法让他们远离自己。

在纽约，你是无法将他们隔离开来的。谢谢，纽约真是好。某种程度上来说，纽约就像新耶路撒冷。很多人会讨厌新耶路撒冷，因为这些人讨厌纽约。

在那里不会有隔离区。其中一个好处就是你会见到穷人。你如何回应他们？一个迹象是，你能看出金钱对你已失去控制力，因为你知道耶稣舍弃了他所有的财富来成为你的财富。

这让你谦卑、融化，并提升你的心灵。另一个迹象是你不再有困难去爱富人。其次，你也不会有困难去爱穷人。但第三个迹象是，金钱已不再对你的人生有掌控力。

你会变得非常慷慨。有趣的是，路加福音22章提到：“眼睛是身上的灯。”这里的“好”字在希腊文中也有“慷慨”的意思。一个真正被耶稣释放脱离金钱束缚的基督徒会有一颗慷慨的心。

你总是寻找机会并抓住它们。你看着你的朋友，你的邻居，你的教会，你看着穷人，看着你的城市。你总是在寻找 ways to give away 的方法。你想知道，我能给多少？

这是我要说的最后一句话。你要看看耶稣做了什么。当耶稣珍视你时，他是以牺牲的方式珍视的。现在，如果你想回应耶稣，这就意味着我不仅要在我的人际关系中活出耶稣基督的十字架，还要在经济上活出耶稣基督的十字架。

跟着我说这个。大多数基督徒都说：“我是基督徒。” 因此，耶稣为我而死，并且他过着一种牺牲的生活。所以我也要像基督爱我那样去爱人。

很好。**这意味着今年你必须捐出足够多的钱，以至于它会改变你的生活方式。**如果你捐钱，但并没有真正影响到你的生活方式，没有做出牺牲，就没有经济上的十字架。如果你没有捐出足够的钱，以至于真的改变了你的生活方式和生活模式，那么就没有什么十字架了。

你就没有真正回应耶稣的恩典。我告诉你，对于大多数人来说，现在还不是这样，我不该说“我们”。对于大多数人来说，在大多数时间和地方，奉献十分之一是目标。为什么？

因为圣经上说，要捐出十分之一，这是一个很好的数字来思考你的捐赠。这可以用来判断福音是否在你心中工作。因为如果福音在你心中工作，并且你看到了耶稣基督为你所做的一切，那么十分之一似乎并不多。毕竟，如果耶稣也只捐了十分之一的血，你仍然会失丧。

耶稣远远超出了十分之一。所以重点是，十分之一并不显得很多。然而，对于大多数人来说，它确实意味着一种牺牲。对于我们中的大多数，十分之一会有它的十字架。

对我们中的大多数来说，10%真的会很难。它会让你感到痛苦。但是在美国，越来越多的人发现捐出10%并没有什么大的影响。其实，这10%并不是重点。

圣经会告诉你我应该捐多少。10%只是一个大概的建议，一个起点。十字架才是标准。对于大多数人来说，10%只是一个例子。

但十字架是标准。你生活中有十字架吗？在经济生活中，如果你以耶稣为宝，你会爱富人，也会爱穷人。如果你以耶稣为宝，你会乐意、主动地分享你的钱财。

这就是早期教会如此成功的原因。我们有一封来自狄纳格图斯的旧信，他提到早期基督徒的情况。为什么他们受欢迎，为什么人们感到震惊。他说，我们与所有人共享餐桌，但不与所有人共享床铺。

换句话说，异教徒在身体上放纵，在金钱上却吝啬；而基督徒在身体上节制，在金钱上却慷慨大方。哪种人会是好邻居？换句话说，你会愿意住在什么样的社区？我上周说过，我认为，你会愿意住在一群对金钱吝啬、对身体放纵的人中间吗？

这会对社区产生什么影响呢？如果你是个孩子，你想住在哪里？你想住在一个这样的社区里吗？还是你想住在一个有性道德和财务慷慨之人的社区里？

一个充满这样人的城市会是健康的城市。一个充满这样人的社区也会是一个健康的社区。登山宝训带来的公共影响非常巨大。让我们实践它吧。

让我们祷告。我们的天父，感谢您赐给我们时间思考如何在天上珍藏财富的意义。我们感谢您的儿子为我们所做的一切。我们感谢这一切。

我们也祈求祢帮助这些成为我们生活的现实，使金钱不再对我们有控制力。不再因别人比我们有钱而感到畏惧，也不再感到自卑、愤怒或自高自大。哦，主啊，请改变我们，让我们成为完全不同的类型的人。我们是独特的人。

祢过去已经这样做了。早期的教会确实理解这一点。我们也愿如此。我们在耶稣的名里祷告。
