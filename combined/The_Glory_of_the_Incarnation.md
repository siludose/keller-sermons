## "道成肉身"——人类思想的革命

Welcome to Gospel in Life. Today, Tim Keller is looking at a passage from the opening chapter of the Gospel of John. John begins his account of Christ's birth not with shepherds or angels, but with the mystery of the Word becoming flesh, God Himself entering the world as a person in Jesus Christ. Join us as Tim Keller explores the meaning of Jesus' birth. Today's scripture is from the Gospel of John, chapter 1, verses 14 through 18. The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us. We have seen His glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.

John testified concerning Him. He cried out, saying, This is the one I spoke about when I said, He who comes after me has surpassed me, because He was before me. Out of His fullness we have all received grace, in place of grace already given. For the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is Himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made Him known. The Word of the Lord.

Well, this verse, or these verses, especially the very beginning, the Word became flesh and He made His dwelling among us. We have seen His glory, the glory of the one and only Son, He is dwelling among us, and we beheld His glory. The Word became flesh. That's probably the most profound, simplest, concise summary of what Christmas is all about, that there is anywhere. It can be said, or Bible. And when the original hearers of John's Gospel, Jews and Greeks, heard the term, the Word became flesh, it was revolutionary. In fact, many people have said that John chapter 1 marked a complete revolution in the history of human thought.

Jews, when they heard the Word of God, they knew it was the Word of God that meant their God was not a remote, unknowable God. God speaks. God speaks through His Word. He speaks through His prophets. He spoke through the burning bush. He spoke on Mount Sinai.

So He's not just a remote, ineffable God. He's a God who we can know. So the Word of God is crucial to Jews.

But the Logos, because this was originally written in Greek, of course, the word Logos, it says the Logos became flesh. The Logos was a term that was very, very momentous and significant to the Greeks and the Romans. They believed that the universe was not a chaos, but a cosmos. It was not a chaos, that there was an order behind it. And the word Logos, which we get our word logic and reason, was a philosophical term that meant, that the universe was not just a kind of chaotic thing.

There was a kind of order behind it, some absolute principles behind it that we could discern through philosophical contemplation. And if we aligned our lives with it, then things would go well. So the Logos was sort of like the cosmic order at the heart of the universe. To the Greeks, to the Jews, it was the self-revelation of a knowable God.

And then suddenly, John comes and says, yeah, but the word became flesh. And he dwelt among us. And we beheld his glory. And what the Jews are realizing, John was saying is, that even if you study all the words of the law of God, the way now to know God is, if the self-revelation, if the word of God had become a human being, the way to know God is to know that human being. What a radical statement that is.

But the Greeks and Romans realized what he was saying was, if the way to connect to the very cosmic center of the universe is to know this flesh and blood human being. It was incredible. The word became flesh. And by the way, the word flesh there is a kind of graphic word. It's a word that almost means what we might say, meat. And it was a way of saying the word became really physical. It didn't just appear to be a human being.

It wasn't a hologram. It wasn't a humanoid. The word became flesh.

But the Son of God, the Creator of the universe, the Son of God, the Creator of the universe, the Son of God, the transcendent God, the cosmic center of the universe became a flesh and blood human being who could be known, Jesus Christ. Now that's Christmas. But, and you know what, actually, that's the whole sermon.

But at least to say that's what the doctrine is. That's what the teaching is. But what I like to do is think about the fact that Christmas doesn't change our lives like it ought to. This is a life transforming truth. In many ways, but what I like to do is draw out three ways in which this truth of its grasp should change our lives. Three extremely practical implications. If you really believe the doctrine of Christmas, then these three things are true.

And we should grasp them with both hands and make sure that we live them out. Here's the three things, three implications, three practical implications. Number one, if Christmas happened and it did, we have infinite comfort in the face of suffering.

Now, by the way, Christmas comforts us or strengthens us for suffering actually at two levels. First is just, frankly, there's the understanding level, almost kind of like the intellectual level. See, when you see somebody suffering, who's really a great person, a wonderful person, they're going through horrendous suffering. It's just natural to say, what kind of God would allow something like that?

这节经文，或者说这几节经文，尤其是开头的那句——"道成了肉身，住在我们中间。我们也见过他的荣光，正是父独生子的荣光。"他住在我们中间，我们见过他的荣光。道成了肉身。这大概是有史以来对圣诞节意义最深刻、最简洁、最精炼的概括了，无论是在圣经中还是在圣经之外，你都找不到比这更好的表述。当约翰福音最初的听众——犹太人和希腊人——听到"道成了肉身"这个表述时，那是革命性的。事实上，许多人都说过，约翰福音第一章标志着人类思想史上一次彻底的革命。

犹太人听到"神的道"这个词，他们知道这是神的话语，这意味着他们的神不是一位遥远的、不可认识的神。神说话。神通过他的话语说话。他通过先知说话。他借着燃烧的荆棘说话。他在西奈山上说话。

所以他不仅仅是一位遥远的、不可言说的神。他是一位我们可以认识的神。因此"神的道"对犹太人来说至关重要。

但"逻各斯"（Logos）——因为这部福音书原本是用希腊文写的——"逻各斯"这个词对希腊人和罗马人来说也是极其重要、意义深远的术语。他们相信宇宙不是混沌的，而是有序的。宇宙不是混沌，背后有秩序。"逻各斯"这个词，就是我们英文"逻辑"（logic）和"理性"（reason）的词根，它是一个哲学术语，意思是宇宙并不仅仅是一种混乱无序的存在。

在宇宙背后有某种秩序，有某些绝对的原则，是我们可以通过哲学沉思来辨明的。如果我们的生活与之对齐，事情就会顺利。所以"逻各斯"在希腊人看来，就像是宇宙核心处的宇宙秩序。对希腊人而言是宇宙秩序，对犹太人而言则是可认识之神的自我启示。

然后，约翰突然来说：是的，但那道成了肉身。他住在我们中间。我们见过他的荣光。约翰告诉犹太人的是什么呢？他说的是：即使你研究了神的律法中所有的话语，如今认识神的方式已经改变了——如果神的自我启示、神的话语已经成为一个人，那么认识神的途径就是认识那个人。这是何等激进的宣告！

而希腊人和罗马人也意识到约翰在说什么——如果与宇宙最核心的存在连接的途径，就是认识这个有血有肉的人，那真是不可思议！道成了肉身。顺便说一句，这里的"肉身"是一个非常形象的词。这个词几乎等同于我们所说的"肉体"。这是在说，道真真实实地成为了肉体。他不是仅仅看起来像一个人。

他不是全息影像。他不是类人机器。道成了肉身。

神的儿子，宇宙的创造者，神的儿子，宇宙的创造者，神的儿子，超越一切的神，宇宙的核心，成为了一个有血有肉的、可以被认识的人——耶稣基督。这就是圣诞节。而且你知道吗，其实这就是整篇讲道了。

至少可以说，这就是教义的内容，这就是教导的核心。但我想做的是思考一个事实：圣诞节并没有像它应该的那样改变我们的生命。这是一个能够改变生命的真理。在许多方面都是如此，但我想做的是引出这个真理被真正领悟后应该改变我们生命的三个方面。三个极其实际的应用。如果你真的相信圣诞节的教义，那么以下三件事就是真实的。

我们应该双手紧握这些真理，确保我们把它们活出来。以下就是这三件事，三个应用，三个实际的应用。第一，如果圣诞节确实发生了——而它确实发生了——我们在苦难面前就拥有无限的安慰。

## 苦难中的无限安慰

And it's typical, unfortunately, for religious people to speak like this. They say, well, you know, God works in mysterious ways and he has his good reasons, but it's too complicated for us, so you just have to have faith. Religious people talk like that all the time. And I have to say, it's kind of infuriating. It feels shallow. It feels callous. And you want to say, why should I trust this God?

And how do you know he's got good reasons? You can say, oh, he's got good reasons. How do you know he's got good reasons for allowing this suffering?

Christmas, actually. See, I've never gotten over the fact that Albert Camus, Albert Camus, the French existentialist, philosopher, and novelist, wrote this about Jesus at one point. He says, Christ, the God-man, suffered. Evil and death can no longer be entirely imputed to him since he suffers and dies. For in the shadow of Calvary, the divinity ostensibly abandoned its traditional privilege, and lived through to the end, despair included, the agony of death. Jesus, the God-man, abandoned his traditional privilege and lived through to the end, despair included, the agony of death.

So we can't completely blame him. And what Camus is saying is, I think it's just simply this. His argument is, if God came to earth and involved himself in our life of pain, and suffered, and lived through to the end, despair included, the agony of death.

So we can't completely blame him. If God came to earth and involved himself in our life of pain, and suffered enormously, suffered infinitely, suffered horrendously, then if you ask, well, why is God allowing evil and suffering to continue?

We still don't know what the reason he is doing that is. We still don't know what the reason is. But now we know what the reason isn't. It isn't that he doesn't care. It isn't that he's remote. It isn't that he doesn't love us. See?

And what Camus is saying is, we still don't know why. But the fact that he suffered. See, other religions have God up there, impervious to suffering. And if you say, why does that God allow evil and suffering?

And, well, he's got his reasons. Well, I don't know. How do I know he's got good reasons?

But this God, the God who comes to earth and suffers, then whatever his reasons are, it's not that he doesn't care. It's not that he doesn't know what we're going through. And so, see, even at a kind of understanding level, as Camus says, it's a suffering God. And you don't shake your fist at that God in the same way. You still don't know. You still wrestle. At the same time, you say, I know he loves us.

And it's not just at the understanding level. The doctrine of Christmas actually helps us at the actual experience level, when you're actually going through it, when you really are in darkness and despair. Hebrews chapter 2 says, because Jesus himself suffered, he is able to help those who are being tried and tested. Because Jesus suffered, he can help you. If you're going through something really hard, and some well-meaning person who's never experienced what you've experienced, some well-meaning person comes along and says, oh, you know, buck up, you know, you can do it, you can get through it. Maybe we shouldn't, maybe we shouldn't, but there's something in us that wants to say, and sometimes we say it out loud, you have no idea what I'm going through. You know, save your breath.

And somebody who hasn't gone through what we've gone through, and we're sinking, we just save your breath. You know, you don't know. But if you meet somebody who's not only been through every single thing you've been through, but 10 times worse, 10 times worse, you listen to that person, don't you?

顺便说一句，圣诞节在两个层面上安慰我们、坚固我们去面对苦难。首先，坦白说，有一个认知层面，差不多是理智上的层面。你看，当你看到某个人在受苦——一个真正伟大的人，一个很好的人——他们正在经历可怕的苦难。人很自然就会说：什么样的神会允许这样的事情发生？

不幸的是，宗教人士通常会这样说。他们说：哦，你知道，神的作为是奥秘的，他有他的好理由，但这太复杂了，我们理解不了，所以你只能凭信心。宗教人士总是这样说。我必须说，这有点让人恼火。这感觉很肤浅。这感觉很冷漠。你会想说：我为什么要信任这位神？

你怎么知道他有好理由？你可以说，哦，他有好理由。但你怎么知道他有好理由允许这些苦难？

圣诞节，其实就回答了这个问题。你看，我一直对一件事念念不忘——阿尔贝·加缪，法国存在主义哲学家和小说家，有一次写了这样一段关于耶稣的话。他说："基督，神人，受了苦。邪恶和死亡不再能完全归咎于他，因为他自己也受苦、也死了。因为在各各他山的阴影下，神性明显放弃了他传统的特权，彻底经历了——包括绝望在内——死亡的痛苦。"耶稣，这位神人，放弃了他传统的特权，彻底经历了——包括绝望在内——死亡的痛苦。

所以我们不能完全责怪他。加缪说的，我认为简单来说就是这个意思。他的论点是：如果神来到地上，参与了我们痛苦的生活，受了苦，彻底经历了——包括绝望在内——死亡的痛苦。

所以我们不能完全责怪他。如果神来到地上，参与了我们痛苦的生活，承受了巨大的苦难，承受了无限的苦难，承受了可怕的苦难，那么当你问：神为什么允许邪恶和苦难继续存在？

我们仍然不知道他这样做的原因是什么。我们仍然不知道原因。但现在我们知道了原因不是什么。不是因为他不在乎。不是因为他高高在上。不是因为他不爱我们。你明白吗？

加缪说的是：我们仍然不知道为什么。但他受了苦这个事实——你看，其他宗教中的神高高在上，不受苦难影响。如果你问：那位神为什么允许邪恶和苦难？

哦，他有他的理由。好吧，我不知道。我怎么知道他有好理由？

但这位神，这位来到地上受苦的神，那么无论他的理由是什么，至少不是因为他不在乎。不是因为他不知道我们正在经历什么。所以你看，即使在认知层面，正如加缪所说，这是一位受苦的神。你不会以同样的方式向这位神挥拳。你仍然不知道为什么。你仍然在挣扎。但同时你说：我知道他爱我们。

## 受苦的神能坚固受苦的人

And when that person says, do this and do this, and you can do it. See, when that person strengthens you, you feel strengthened. Well, look at Jesus.

Here's the only God. He knows, look, are you feeling lonely?

He's the, of all the religions in the world, this is the only one who says, God has been in every darkness you've been in and more. You feel alone and misunderstood?

So is he. Are you betrayed?

So is he. Are you destitute?

Are you facing death? So is he. Are you saying, but I feel God has abandoned me. Think about it.

So is he. I prayed and God hasn't answered my prayer. Go to the Garden of Gethsemane passage.

So he was turned down too. Every place you could ever go, he's been there. Every darkness you could ever be in, he's been there and more. He can strengthen you.

That's what it says. He will strengthen you. Go to him.

There's that great, you know, poem called Jesus of the Scars. And the last stanza goes like this. I think I can remember it. The poet is contrasting the different gods of the different religions. And he's looking at Jesus and he says, the other gods did ride. Thou did stumble to thy throne. To our wounds, only God's wounds can speak.

And no God has wounds, but thou alone. To our wounds, only God's wounds can speak and no other God has wounds, but thou alone. So first of all, the Doctor of Christmas gives you infinite, comfort and suffering. Are you taking it?

不仅仅是在认知层面。圣诞节的教义实际上在经验层面也帮助我们——当你真正在经历苦难的时候，当你真的处于黑暗和绝望中的时候。希伯来书第二章说：

> "他自己既然被试探而受苦，就能搭救被试探的人。"
> ——希伯来书 2:18

因为耶稣自己受了苦，他能帮助你。如果你正在经历一些非常艰难的事情，而某个好心人——一个从未经历过你所经历之事的好心人——走过来对你说：哦，你知道，振作起来，你可以的，你能撑过去的。也许我们不应该——也许我们不应该这样——但我们内心有一种冲动想说（有时我们会大声说出来）：你根本不知道我在经历什么。你就别说了。

一个没有经历过我们所经历之事的人，而我们正在下沉，我们只想说：你就别说了。你不懂。但如果你遇到一个人，他不仅经历过你所经历的每一件事，而且还严重十倍，严重十倍，你会听那个人的话，对不对？

当那个人说，你这样做、那样做，你能行的——你看，当那个人坚固你的时候，你会感到力量。好，看看耶稣。

他是独一的神。他知道——听着，你感到孤独吗？

在世界上所有的宗教中，只有这一个说：神曾经历过你所经历的每一个黑暗，而且更甚。你感到孤独和被误解吗？

他也是。你被背叛了吗？

他也是。你一贫如洗吗？

你面对死亡吗？他也是。你说：但我感觉神已经离弃了我。想想这个。

他也是。我祷告了，但神没有回应我的祷告。去读客西马尼园的经文吧。

他的祷告也被拒绝了。你可能去到的每一个地方，他都去过了。你可能身处的每一个黑暗中，他都在那里，而且经历得更深。他能坚固你。

经文就是这么说的。他会坚固你。去找他。

有一首很好的诗，叫做《带伤痕的耶稣》（Jesus of the Scars）。最后一节是这样的。我想我还能记得。诗人把不同宗教的不同神祇作对比。他看着耶稣说：众神都骑马而行，唯独你蹒跚走向你的宝座。对我们的伤口，唯有神的伤口能够言说。

除你以外，没有别的神有伤痕。对我们的伤口，唯有神的伤口能够言说，除你以外，没有别的神有伤痕。所以首先，圣诞节的教义给你在苦难中的无限安慰。你有在接受吗？

听着，在座的各位，所有你们这些人类——好吗？其余不是人类的可以暂时不用听——所有人类，你要么已经受过苦，要么正在受苦，要么不久就将要受苦。所以你有这份安慰吗？

## 效法道成肉身：投入服事

Look, everybody, all of you out there who are human beings, okay? The rest of you can just not listen for a minute, but all human beings, you either have suffered or you are suffering or soon you will be suffering something. So do you have this?

Okay. Number one. Number two, second thing Christmas does besides giving us infinite comfort and suffering is a powerful incentive to serve. An incredibly powerful incentive. To serve.

See, when God came down, you know, at the incarnation, he got involved. Uh, I'm old enough. And some of you look like you might be old enough.

I remember not only the headlines, but even some of the commentary because I just getting into high school at the time around a young woman named Kitty Genovese who lived in Queens and was stabbed to death within, uh, right near her apartment building. She was outside of her apartment building, but she was stabbed to death. She was assaulted and stabbed to death. And she cried out and screamed. And people heard the scream.

But not only did no one come down to try to help her, but nobody called it police. And afterwards, of course, there was all this, uh, uh, there was a lot of talk about what's happened to our society, you know, but what, what, one of the more famous, a reporter got one person anonymously who was in the building and who had heard the screams who hadn't done anything to say, why didn't you come down or why didn't you call?

And the person said, I'm not sure it was a male or female. The person said, I didn't want to get involved. That's probably the most famous quote that comes out of that whole incident in 1964. I didn't want to get involved. And of course, think about it. If you come, you hear somebody screaming outside, if you come down, you might get killed yourself. Or even if you call it in, you know, you suddenly are involved with the police and they want to take statements and maybe they want to ask you what you were doing at the time.

Maybe you don't want to talk about what you were doing at the time. Um, or maybe even if, after you give evidence that the perpetrator's friends will come and get you and you'll die. In other words, I don't want to get involved. Why?

Because being involved makes you vulnerable. Um, the first place we get this image in the Bible is near the beginning where Cain kills Abel and God comes to Cain and says, what have you done?

The blood of your brother Abel cries out to me from the ground. And there's a number of places in the Bible where we're told that shed blood of the innocent, the evils, uh, uh, and the injustice that are perpetrated here on earth, cry out to God. What does the doctrine of Christmas teach?

Here's what the doctrine of Christmas teaches. That God heard those cries and he did come down. He came down, he got involved and he knew he would be killed.

Now, here's what's so scary. Do you know in Philippians 2, there's a place in Philippians 2 where it says, have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.

In other words, have the same motivation or the same mindset of Jesus Christ, who though he was God, didn't count equality with God something to be grasped, but he emptied himself and he laid aside his glory and he came down and he became a human being obedient to the cross. So Philippians 2 says, when you see Jesus Christ coming down, getting involved to the point of vulnerability, to the point of being just drained of life, now you go do that too. That's what it says. That's your model.

What are we going to do about that? Notice I didn't call this infinite comfort like I did the first point. The first point was infinite comfort in suffering.

The second point is infinite. The powerful conviction that we ought to be getting involved. I mean, let me just give you, listen, this applies in a lot of different ways. They're not all life threatening, but for example, we were talking about giving. You know, you can give to the point it's comfortable. You can look at, you can say, I want to give this amount away. And the amount you're giving away has absolutely nothing, has no impact on the way you live your life.

It's not really cutting into your savings. It's not cutting into your investments. It's not cutting into your lifestyle. You're able to do the things you want to do. This is money that's almost literally disposable. Okay. That's not getting involved.

Give to the point where you feel vulnerable. Give to the point where you say, I can't do things I would like to do. Give to the point where you're not quite as financially secure as you would have been if you hadn't given, given, give it till what?

Till you're starting to act like Jesus. Till you're starting to imitate the incarnation. Give, give to the point of vulnerability. Or let me just think about this.

A lot of people come to church, but they never join. They come to receive, but they don't want to join. They don't want the accountability. They don't want the responsibility. They don't want, you know, they want to keep their options open all the time.

But see, in other words, you don't want to, you don't want to get involved. You're not too involved, not to involve to the point where it's actually cramping you. But my goodness, imitate the incarnation. Or, generally, listen, there are people around you that you, if you, you might know who they are, but you may actually have been a little afraid to even look because you don't want to get involved. There are, there are neighbors.

There are colleagues. There are brothers and sisters. There are people around you who are hurting. They've got needs. And you know that if you show much interest and if you show much sympathy, you're going to kind of get sucked in. It'll be emotionally draining. It'll be difficult.

Get involved. You know that if you publicly identify as a Christian, in certain circles, there might be some flack you'll take. Get involved to the point of vulnerability. B.B. Warfield was a, taught at Princeton, was a theologian, not a preacher. And he wrote a sermon, I guess, preached a sermon called Imitating the Incarnation.

That's a little bit Victorian, a little bit, a little florid, but it's, it's still quite powerful. He's looking at the incarnation. It was a sermon on Philippians 2 that I already mentioned. And here's what he said, talking about Jesus. He says, Jesus was led to forget himself in the needs of others. Self-sacrifice brought Jesus Christ into the world. And self-sacrifice will lead his followers not away from, but into the midst of human society.

Wherever people suffer, there will we be to comfort. Wherever they strive, there will we be to help. Wherever they fall, there will we be to uplift. Self-sacrifice means not indifference to our times and our fellows. It means absorption in them. It means forgetfulness of self in others. It means entering into every person's hopes and fears, longings and despairs.

It means many-sidedness of spirit, multi-form activity, multiplicity of sympathies. It means not that we should live one life, but a thousand lives, binding ourselves to a thousand souls by the filaments of so loving a sympathy that their lives become ours. So first, practical implication, infinite comfort in the face of suffering.

Second, powerful conviction to serve others to the point of vulnerability, to get involved, to come down. But lastly, Christmas gives us a hope that is both realistic, realistic, and at the same time, infallible. Look at this, the rest of the passage, I mean, I've just spent the whole time just on the word became flesh, but it says, and made his dwelling among us.

好，第一点。第二点，圣诞节除了给我们苦难中的无限安慰之外，还给我们一个强有力的服事动力。一个令人难以置信的强大动力。去服事。

你看，当神在道成肉身中降临的时候，他投入了进来。呃，我年纪够大了。你们中间有些人看起来也够大了。

我不仅记得当时的新闻标题，甚至还记得一些评论，因为那时我刚上高中。那件事是关于一个叫凯蒂·吉诺维斯（Kitty Genovese）的年轻女性，她住在皇后区，在她公寓楼附近被刺死了。她在公寓楼外面，被袭击并被刺死了。她呼喊、尖叫。人们听到了尖叫声。

但不仅没有人下来试图帮助她，而且没有人报警。事后，当然，有很多讨论——我们的社会怎么了——但其中一个比较著名的是，一位记者匿名采访了楼里一个听到尖叫但什么也没做的人，问他：你为什么不下来，或者你为什么不报警？

那个人说——我不确定那是男是女。那个人说："我不想卷进去。"这大概是1964年那整件事中最著名的一句话了。我不想卷进去。当然，想想看。如果你听到外面有人尖叫，如果你下去，你自己可能会被杀。或者即使你打电话报警，你突然就和警察扯上关系了，他们要录口供，也许他们还会问你当时在干什么。

也许你不想谈你当时在干什么。或者，也许即使你作了证，凶手的朋友会来找你，你就死定了。换句话说，我不想卷进去。为什么？

因为卷进去会让你变得脆弱。我们在圣经中最早看到这个画面是在接近开头的地方，该隐杀了亚伯，然后神来到该隐面前说：你做了什么？

你兄弟亚伯的血从地里向我哀告。圣经中有多处告诉我们，无辜者所流的血、在世上所行的邪恶和不义，都在向神哀告。圣诞节的教义教导了什么？

圣诞节的教义教导的是：神听到了那些哀告，他确实降下来了。他降下来了，他投入了，他知道自己会被杀。

现在，这就是可畏之处。你知道在腓立比书第二章，有一处说：

> "你们当以基督耶稣的心为心：他本有神的形像，不以自己与神同等为强夺的；反倒虚己，取了奴仆的形像，成为人的样式；既有人的样子，就自己卑微，存心顺服，以至于死，且死在十字架上。"
> ——腓立比书 2:5-8

换句话说，要有耶稣基督同样的心志或同样的思维方式——他虽然是神，却不把与神同等当作紧抓不放的东西，反倒虚己，放下荣耀，降下来，成为人，顺服以至于死在十字架上。所以腓立比书第二章说：当你看到耶稣基督降下来、投入进去、脆弱到极点、甚至生命被耗尽——现在你也去这样做。这就是经文说的。这就是你的榜样。

我们对此怎么办呢？注意，我没有像第一点那样称之为"无限的安慰"。第一点是苦难中无限的安慰。

第二点是——强有力的信念，催促我们应当投入进去。我是说，让我给你举几个例子，这在很多不同的方面都适用。它们并不全都危及生命。比如，我们谈到了奉献。你知道，你可以奉献到自己觉得舒适的程度。你可以说：我要奉献这个数目。而你奉献的那个数目对你的生活方式完全没有任何影响。

它根本没有动到你的储蓄。没有动到你的投资。没有动到你的生活方式。你仍然能做你想做的事情。这些钱几乎可以说是可有可无的。好，那不叫投入。

要奉献到让你感到脆弱的程度。要奉献到你说"有些我想做的事情做不了了"的程度。要奉献到你的财务安全感不再像以前那样稳固的程度——如果你没有奉献的话。要奉献到什么程度？

到你开始像耶稣那样行事的程度。到你开始效法道成肉身的程度。要奉献到让自己脆弱的程度。或者让我换个角度想想。

很多人来教会，但从不加入。他们来是为了领受，但不想加入。他们不想有人督责。他们不想承担责任。他们不想——你知道——他们想始终保留所有选择的余地。

但你看，换句话说，你不想卷进去。你不会投入到真正让你受约束的程度。但天哪，请效法道成肉身。或者，更广泛地说，听着，在你周围有一些人，你可能知道他们是谁，但你实际上可能一直有点害怕去关注，因为你不想卷进去。有些邻居。

有些同事。有些弟兄姐妹。你周围有些人正在受伤。他们有需要。而你知道，如果你表现出太多的关心和同情，你就会被卷进去。那会消耗你的情感。那会很艰难。

投入进去吧。你知道，如果你在某些圈子里公开承认自己是基督徒，可能会招来一些非议。投入到让自己脆弱的程度。华菲德（B.B. Warfield）是在普林斯顿任教的神学家，不是传道人。他写了一篇讲章——或者说讲了一篇讲章——叫做《效法道成肉身》（Imitating the Incarnation）。

那有一点维多利亚时代的风格，有一点辞藻华丽，但仍然相当有力。他在审视道成肉身。那是一篇关于我刚才提到的腓立比书第二章的讲章。他这样论到耶稣。他说："耶稣被引导在他人的需要中忘记自己。自我牺牲将耶稣基督带入了这个世界。自我牺牲也将引导他的跟随者，不是远离人群，而是进入人类社会的核心。"

"哪里有人受苦，我们就在哪里安慰。哪里有人挣扎，我们就在哪里帮助。哪里有人跌倒，我们就在哪里扶持。自我牺牲不是对我们的时代和同胞漠不关心。它意味着全然投入。它意味着在他人中忘记自我。它意味着进入每个人的盼望与恐惧、渴望与绝望之中。"

"它意味着灵里的多面性、行动的多样化、同情的丰富性。它不是说我们应该只活一条生命，而是活一千条生命，用如此深切的爱的同情之丝将我们与千万灵魂绑在一起，以至于他们的生命成为我们的生命。"所以，第一个实际应用：苦难面前的无限安慰。

第二，强有力的信念催促我们服事他人、投入到脆弱的程度、降下来。

## 既现实又确定的盼望

Now, some of you may have heard before that there's a kind of odd Greek word used there, where it, and some literal translations will put it there. What John actually says is the word became flesh and pitched his tent among us, or pitched his tabernacle among us. Now, maybe that was just a vivid way for John to say pitched his tent, you know, and a lot of people lived in tents.

Well, actually, that's not true. Back then, a lot of people did not live in tents. So why in the world would it say the word became flesh and tabernacled among us?

Well, it tells you right away, and we beheld his glory, and then later on, it talks about, for the law was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. What is this talking about?

Here's what it's talking about. The tabernacle was the place where the Shekinah glory of God dwelled, but back behind the holy of holies. It was both the tabernacle, then later the temple.

There was this veil between sinful people and the, uh, and glory of God. And the, nobody could actually go, back there, except the high priest once a year, but people could draw near as long as there was blood sacrifices made to atone for sin. Now, what is all that about?

Why, what was all that about? Well, here's what it was about. It was about what happened in the very beginning of the Bible, the garden of Eden.

Here's Adam and Eve, and they are in paradise. Let's call that the ideal world, the ideal world, and everything's perfect, but then they sin, they turn away from God. They want to be their own masters, their own saviors and lords. And they're cast out into what?

The real world and the real world. And by the way, we're all in the real world. Let me just tell you two things about the real world. Everybody loses everyone they love. Everybody loses everyone they love eventually. And all life ends in death.

So they were cast out of the real world, ideal world where none of those things are true into the real world. And between them and the real world, the, between the real and the ideal world was a flaming sword. You can go see this as back in Genesis three, a flaming sword that turned every way.

What is that? It's the penalty for our sin. If you are, if you're a fugitive or you're an exile, you, you, you run away. If you want to come back home, you're going to have to face justice.

And so what the Bible is actually trying to say is there's a barrier between the real and the ideal. And the barrier between the real and the ideal is a barrier between God and sinful human beings. And there's a barrier there. And no one can pass it without paying the penalty, which is death for the wages of sin.

Now think about this. What is Christmas about?

Huh? The word became flesh. Okay. That's just a magic trick. A big one, of course, but a magic trick, but no, in order to dwell among us so that we could see his glory.

What does that mean? It means, first of all, the ideal came into the real. Jesus Christ, the ideal actually came into the real. He came into the real. He came into the real world.

Here he is. But that wasn't all. At the end of his life, he died. He became a human being so that he could die. He became a human being. He became vulnerable. As we said, he became killable.

And when he went to the cross, he went under the sword. He took the penalty. And when he did that, tell me, you remember the book of Matthew says that the veil between us and God, between the real and the ideal was torn from top to bottom. And what that means is simply this. Jesus Christ, our great captain, has opened a cleft in the pitiless walls of the world. He's punched a hole between the ideal and the real. He came through it.

And now he's opened a way for us to get back in. Right now, the wall has not come down, but the Holy Spirit comes into us when we believe in Jesus Christ and changes begin. And someday the whole wall will come down and the real world, world will become the ideal world again. Kathy and I always liked the, uh, the musical man of La Mancha, which is based on, you know, the novel by Cervantes, uh, Don Quixote. And of course the basic story is a man who hates the real world.

And so he's going to live in the ideal world. He hates the real world. So he goes mad and he says, I'm a knight, I'm Don Quixote. And he starts to fight against giants, which are actually windmills, uh, and dragons. And he tries to rescue people. Right. And, um, uh, well, you know, he's mad.

At one point, somebody sits down, tries to talk to him and says, you know, there are no evil sorcerers. There are no dragons. There are no giants. You know, that none of these things are true. He says, well, facts are the enemy of truth.

And then, then the guy who's trying to argue with him says, this is madness. And then he says, I've seen life as it is. I've seen life as it is. Maybe too much sanity is madness and maddest of all to see life as it is and not as it ought to be.

Now, what you have there is a kind of, frankly, when this thing was written, it was the heyday of the existentialist of the 20th century. And we have a little, we have a little existentialist sermon there. Here's what the guy is saying. The guy is saying, he says, you know, I'm not really crazy.

I know there's a wall between the ideal and the real, right? Here's the life as it is the real. And as it ought to be the ideal. And I'm just going to live as if it's the way life ought to be and not the way it is. That's all there is to it.

I know that the never, they will never come together. I know I'll go down to never ending defeat. I know that.

But see, there's a concrete slab between the real and the ideal, and I'm going to live in the ideal. That's it. But you see, Christians are utterly different.

There are two kinds of people. And then there's Christians. Realists say, Hey, come on, this is the way life is, you know, don't be a boy scout, that kind of thing.

And then there's idealists. They're saying, I'm going to go down to a never ending defeat, but I'm going to live as if this is true, live as it's true. So they have the idealist and the realist, then you have Christians. And we know that Jesus Christ has brought the ideal into the real. And someday there'll be a new heavens and new earth, and you're gonna have glorifying bodies.

And that means that even though we're realistic, we know there's a lot that's wrong with this world. And we don't expect it to happen until Jesus actually makes everything right — that all of it happens. But if you're a Christian, you'll never look at anything and say, "That'll never change." You'll never look at any evil, you'll never look at anything wrong inside or outside and say, "That'll never change," because you know that even now with the power of the Holy Spirit it can change. And someday it will.

And what realisticness — you see how realistic that is? Much more realistic than the person who's living in the ideal world but far more idealistic and hopeful than the person who's living in the real world.

You know, in that play there's a woman named Aldonza who's a prostitute, and Don Quixote treats her as if she's a queen, royalty. And at first she's angry about it, but then in the end she's moved by it, and she embraces it, even though she's not — she's going to live as if she's royalty even though she's not.

最后，圣诞节给我们一个既现实又确定无疑的盼望。看看经文的其余部分。我的意思是，我花了整段时间只在讲"道成了肉身"，但经文说："住在我们中间。"

你们中有些人可能以前听说过，这里用了一个很特别的希腊词。有些直译版本会把它翻出来。约翰实际上说的是：道成了肉身，在我们中间支搭了他的帐幕，或者说在我们中间支搭了他的会幕。也许这只是约翰用一种生动的方式说"支搭帐幕"吧，毕竟很多人住在帐篷里。

不，实际上那个时代很多人并不住在帐篷里。那么为什么要说道成了肉身、在我们中间搭了帐幕呢？

经文紧接着就告诉你："我们也见过他的荣光"，后面又说："律法本是借着摩西传的；恩典和真理都是由耶稣基督来的。"这在说什么？

它在说这个。会幕是神的同在之荣光——舍金纳荣光——所居住的地方，但是在至圣所的幔子后面。无论是会幕还是后来的圣殿。

在罪人和神的荣耀之间有一层幔子。没有人能真正进到后面去，只有大祭司一年一次可以进去，但人们可以靠近——只要有赎罪的血祭。那么这一切是关于什么的？

这一切是关于什么的？好，让我告诉你。这是关于圣经最开头所发生的事情——伊甸园。

亚当和夏娃在乐园中。我们称之为"理想世界"——理想的世界，一切都是完美的。然后他们犯了罪，他们背离了神。他们想要作自己的主人、自己的拯救者和主宰。他们被赶出去了，进入了什么？

进入了现实世界。而这个现实世界——顺便说一句，我们都活在现实世界中。让我告诉你关于现实世界的两件事。每个人最终都会失去自己所爱的每一个人。每个人最终都会失去自己所爱的每一个人。而所有的生命都以死亡告终。

所以他们被从那个理想世界——在那里这些事都不存在——赶出来，进入了现实世界。在他们和理想世界之间是一把火焰的剑。你可以回到创世记第三章去看，一把四面转动的火焰之剑。

那是什么？那是我们罪的刑罚。如果你是逃犯或流亡者，你逃走了。如果你想回家，你必须面对审判。

所以圣经实际上要说的是：在现实和理想之间有一道屏障。在现实和理想之间的屏障就是神与有罪之人之间的屏障。那里有一道隔绝。没有人能不付代价就穿过去，因为罪的工价就是死。

现在想想这个。圣诞节是关于什么的？

嗯？道成了肉身。好吧。那只是一个魔术而已。当然是一个大魔术，但只是个魔术。不——不仅如此——他住在我们中间，以至于我们能看见他的荣光。

这意味着什么？首先，这意味着理想进入了现实。耶稣基督，那理想的本体，确实进入了现实。他进入了现实世界。他进入了现实世界。

他就在这里。但那还不是全部。在他生命的尽头，他死了。他成为人，为的是能够死。他成为人。他变得脆弱。正如我们说的，他变得可以被杀。

当他上十字架的时候，他承受了那把剑。他承担了刑罚。当他这样做的时候——你记得马太福音说，在我们与神之间、在现实与理想之间的那道幔子，从上到下裂开了。这意味着什么？很简单：耶稣基督，我们伟大的元帅，在这个世界无情的墙壁上凿开了一条裂缝。他在理想与现实之间打通了一个洞。他从中穿过来了。

而现在他为我们开辟了一条回去的路。此刻，那道墙还没有倒塌，但当我们信靠耶稣基督的时候，圣灵就进入我们里面，改变就开始了。有一天，整堵墙都会倒塌，现实世界将再次成为理想世界。凯西和我一直很喜欢音乐剧《乐侠乐侣》（Man of La Mancha），它是根据塞万提斯的小说《堂吉诃德》改编的。基本的故事是一个人，他厌恶现实世界。

所以他要活在理想世界里。他厌恶现实世界。所以他发疯了，他说：我是一位骑士，我是堂吉诃德。他开始与巨人作战——其实那是风车——还有龙。他试图拯救人们。对，他是疯了。

有一次，有人坐下来试图跟他讲理，说：你知道，没有什么邪恶的巫师。没有龙。没有巨人。你知道这些都不是真的。他说：事实是真理的敌人。

然后那个试图跟他争论的人说：这是疯了。他说："我已经见过了真实的人生。我已经见过了真实的人生。也许太多的理智才是疯狂，而最疯狂的莫过于看到人生的本来面目，而不是看到它应有的模样。"

这里所表达的是一种——坦白说，在这部作品写成的那个年代，正是二十世纪存在主义的鼎盛时期。我们在这里听到了一段小小的存在主义布道。那个人在说什么呢？他在说：你知道吗，我其实没有真的疯。

我知道理想和现实之间有一堵墙，对吧？"人生的本来面目"就是现实，"它应有的模样"就是理想。我只是要活得好像人生就是它应有的样子，而不是本来的面目。就是这样。

我知道理想和现实永远不会交汇。我知道我将走向永无止境的失败。我知道这一点。

但你看，现实与理想之间有一堵混凝土墙，而我要活在理想的那一边。就是这样。但你看，基督徒是完全不同的。

有两种人。然后还有基督徒。现实主义者说：嘿，得了吧，这就是人生，别做好好先生了，诸如此类的。

然后还有理想主义者。他们说：我将走向永无止境的失败，但我要活得好像这是真的，按照理想来生活。所以你有理想主义者和现实主义者，然后你有基督徒。我们知道耶稣基督已经将理想带入了现实。有一天将有新天新地，你将拥有荣耀的身体。

这意味着，虽然我们是现实的——我们知道这个世界有很多不对的地方——我们并不期望在耶稣真正使一切更新之前一切就能实现。但如果你是基督徒，你永远不会看着任何事情说："这永远不会改变。"你永远不会看着任何邪恶，永远不会看着内心或外在任何错误的事情说："这永远不会改变。"因为你知道，即使现在，靠着圣灵的能力，它就能改变。有一天它必定会改变。

你看这是何等现实——你看到这有多么现实了吗？比活在理想世界里的人现实得多，但又比活在现实世界里的人理想和充满盼望得多。

你知道吗，在那部戏里有一个叫阿尔东莎（Aldonza）的女人，她是一个妓女，而堂吉诃德待她如同她是一位女王、一位贵族。起初她对此很愤怒，但最终她被感动了，她接受了这个身份——即使她并不是——她要活得好像自己是贵族，即使她不是。

但看——你可能真的就是一个阿尔东莎。你今天可能就坐在这里，你可能就是一个妓女，而我要你知道：如果你信靠耶稣基督，他拥抱你。你可以成为真正的贵族。真正的贵族。你知道吗，当地上所有伟大王朝的国王和王后都被遗忘的时候，你将与他一同掌权。因为，你看，他已经在现实与理想之间打通了一个洞。我们在耶稣基督里拥有既现实又确定无疑的尊贵。我们拥有既现实又确定无疑的尊贵。救主基督降生了。

## 结束祷告

But look at — you might be literally an Aldonza. You might be here today, you know, and you might be a prostitute, and I want you to know, if you believe in Jesus Christ, he embraces you. You can be literal royalty. Real royalty. You know, when all the kings and queens of all the great royal lines in this — on the earth — are all forgotten, you will be ruling and reigning with him. Because, see, he's punched a hole between the real and the ideal. We have realistic and infallible royalty in the name of Jesus Christ. We have realistic and infallible royalty. Christ the Savior is born.

Let's pray. Thank you, Father, for giving us this great hope, this great comfort, and this great conviction and incentive. Lord, we have to admit that the problem of Christmas is that it's so familiar. We let Christmas just make us feel warm and toasty. We let Christmas just make us feel like it's a time to be inspired and to appreciate our families, and all that's true. But Lord, the message is so much more radical than that. Forgive us for our sins. Forgive us for domesticating and taming the doctrine of Christmas. And let — Lord, it would glorify you and it would be our ultimate joy if the three things we talked about here were realized in our lives by the power of your Holy Spirit and faith in Jesus Christ. In his name we pray.

让我们祷告。天父，感谢你赐给我们这伟大的盼望、这伟大的安慰、以及这伟大的信念和动力。主啊，我们必须承认，圣诞节的问题在于它太熟悉了。我们让圣诞节仅仅给我们温暖舒适的感觉。我们让圣诞节仅仅成为一个受鼓舞和感恩家人的时节——这一切固然不错。但主啊，圣诞节的信息远比这激进得多。求你赦免我们的罪。赦免我们把圣诞节的教义驯化、削弱了。主啊——主啊，如果我们今天所讲的这三件事能够靠着你圣灵的大能和对耶稣基督的信心，在我们生命中实现出来，那将是你的荣耀，也是我们至高的喜乐。奉耶稣基督的名祷告。阿们。
