## 先知、祭司与君王的框架 / Prophet, Priest, and King: The Framework

Welcome to gospel in life. Who is Jesus? The Bible says He's fully God, the creator of the universe, and at the same time, fully human.

Lose one of those and you lose Christianity. Join us for today's podcast where Tim Keller explores the person and promises of Jesus Christ. Every January and June, the pastors get together and we do a short series together on some theme or subject.

And what we're doing here in the month of January, and actually, if you want to see how the subject's divided and how all the assignments have been divvied out, you can find that on the very back page of the bullet and tells you what we're doing in January. After speaking about, we're talking about how to understand Jesus. Now that means that somebody might say, but aren't you always talking about how to understand Jesus?

And the answer is every so often, it's a good idea to give people a helicopter ride in a comprehensive way a look at the biblical doctrine of Christ. The biblical doctrine of Christ means a look at all the various facets of what the Bible teaches about Jesus. The Bible teaches us about Jesus person.

He is human and he's divine. And in the Scott last week, in the morning evening service dealt with that. And it's very, very important, as certain points, to take a look at the two sides of what the Bible teaches about Christ's percentage.

Because if you only see him as human and not divine or only see him as divine and not human, you get into some tremendous trouble and you have a distortion of what it's not Christianity, whatever you come up with, it's not Christianity unless you keep that together. And the Bible, besides teaching those two great things about his person, the Bible teaches three great things about his work. All of the things the Bible tells us that he has done, fit into three basic categories.

He's a prophet, he's a priest, and he's a king. And it behooves us to spend a month in which we basically take a survey of those three aspects of his work. Now let me just put the whole thing in context for you for a moment.

When I say that there's three things, everything that Jesus does, everything that he says or does anywhere in the Bible can fall into one of those three categories. And those categories are used because they are so crucial. If you leave out any one of those three things, if you see him as two of those and not the third, if you see him as one of those and not the third, it gives you a distortion.

It distorts your view of reality. It certainly gives you a concoction that's not Christianity and it's spiritually poisonous if you take it into your system. Let me just give you a couple of examples.

There's plenty of people, when we say prophet, priest, and king, by prophet, we mean he's a revealer. He communicates truth. He's the revealer of God.

Who God is and what his will is, is a prophet. And secondly, he's a priest. That means he's a redeemer.

He's a representative that is he comes to stand in our place. You see, as a prophet, he comes actually representing God, but as a priest, he represents us. As a prophet, he comes and speaks to you and me for God.

But as a priest, he comes and speaks to God the Father for us. He's our stand in. He died in our place.

You see, he brings us to God. He's our advocate. He's our representative.

He's our redeemer. So first, he's a prophet, revealer. Secondly, he's a priest, redeemer.

And thirdly, he's a king, a ruler. He commands us. We owe him our utmost allegiance.

He's the supreme authority in our lives. So there he is, prophet, priest, and king, revealer, redeemer, and ruler. Now, let me just show you what happens if you leave any of them out.

There are plenty of people that I have run into in New York. And I've been thinking a lot about this because I've been reading a book. I'll refer to it again.

It's called New York in the 50s by Dan Wakefield, who was a Columbia University student in the early 50s and stayed in Grant Village, and became part of the beat generation in the Bohemian scene. You know, it was a writer, and anyway, one of the things that I have noticed, I was reading the book, and I realized that I've met so many people who've come to New York City from Middle America. And out in Middle America, they had, in many cases, fairly orthodox kind of Christian upbringing.

But they come to New York, and they completely leave it behind. They disdain the religion of their childhood along with the values of Middle-class American, the values of the great homogeneous American, they dive into the intellectual and cultural and ethnic diversity of New York, and they think of themselves as kind of a superior race now to where they've come from. And very often I'll talk to these folks, and you know who you are.

And what they'll say is, you know, I don't go to church, and I pretty much have lived the way I feel like I should be living, and I don't know what I believe anymore, really. But I know this, that when I was a little girl, when I was a little boy, I made a decision for Christ, and I still somehow believe that he's really for me. I really somehow believe he's still with me.

In other words, I've come here, and my feelings and my experience and my emotions are now my king, and they also are my prophet. In other words, I bring my own truth, I decide what truth was true for me, and I decide how to live. But I still want the idea somehow of a Jesus who's a redeemer.

I don't want him as a king, and I don't want him as a prophet. I don't want him to tell me what's true, and I don't want him to give me any commands. But somehow, I just like the idea that he loves me, and he forgives me, and he's always with me.

All right? That's not Christianity. That's something, but it's not Christianity.

You can't have Jesus with only as priest and not prophet or king. Only as a redeemer and not a revealer and ruler. I'm Timothy James Keller, and if somebody says to me, come in, James, stay out, Timothy, and Keller.

I'll be in a pickle. I won't say, well, you know, I'm sort of a whole thing. I don't know what part of me is the James part, and maybe it's my left arm.

Maybe you can have that. It doesn't work that way. I'm all Timothy.

I'm all James. I'm all Keller. And he's all prophet and all priest and all king.

He just can't have one piece of him. All right, let me, another example, but I'll be more brief, is there are plenty of groups. And I guess I'd say churches, but there's plenty of groups that love the idea of Jesus.

They've really got a very developed view of Jesus as the king and the commander. But their understanding of him as being a redeemer, their understanding of him as being an advocate is very underdeveloped. And in those legalistic groups, you know, you're hit over the head with Jesus says, and Jesus says, and Jesus says, it's very vivid.

It's put across in a very imaginative and vivid way, but any discussion about his redemption and about his grace and about his love is all an abstraction. Jesus is king. Without Jesus as prophet and priest is a terrible, terrible place to be.

However, it's not really Jesus. Or now, one more example, just as the legalistic groups like him as king and not as a priest and just as like licentious people like him as priest, but they don't like the idea of him as king or revealer. So there's an awful lot of folks today.

They didn't actually like the idea of Jesus as a prophet, but not as a priest in a king. In other words, they say, I believe Jesus was a great teacher. I believe he revealed to us a great deal about God.

But I just can't buy in this whole idea of him being a divine savior, a divine king, and so on. Now, one of the most famous, I'll just refer to it here, one of the most famous passages in all of modern Christian literature has got to be that chapter in Mayor Christianity where C. S.

Lewis points out that that's the one thing you can't believe that he's only a prophet. He says the problem with this prophet was that Jesus Christ, the prophet, came and he said, I'm God. You have to worship me.

I alone can forgive your sins. What you think of me will determine where you spend eternity. So this man comes along with all these unbelievable claims.

The saying that he's God and saying that he's got to be the final authority in your life and so on, and you are the stone on which he's the stone on which you will either rise or fall and so forth. So Lewis says something very obvious. He says, if this is true that he claimed all these things, then he's either much more than a prophet or much less than a prophet, but he can't just be a prophet.

Either he's far more than a prophet because he claimed to be or else, he's crazy or he's a liar and he's a fool and he's much less than a prophet, either he's more than a prophet or else we can't believe anything that he says. But the one thing he will not allow you to believe is that he's only a prophet and not a priest in a king. Don't you see, if you try to hold on to one, if you either have one or two and reject the others, or if you even just have a grasp on one and a kind of vague understanding of the others, it will introduce distortions into your life.

In fact, in fact, I think that it would be possible, though I don't think I can go into it right now. It would be possible for me to create a grid, for myself as a pastor to help people understand what's wrong with their Christian lives. I'm talking about Christians here.

I think in most cases, if we look at our Christian lives and we say, what's wrong, where do we need to grow? Where do we have stress fractures in our Christian life? Where is there crumbling, where is there deterioration, where is there weakness?

Ordinarily, you'll be able to do it by looking at this grid. Very often, we're really good. We have a good grasp on Jesus as one of these things and on Jesus as one of the others.

Some of you are really great into the Bible study. The idea of Jesus' prophets great. You love to study his teachings, and you know very, very well, and yet you're not being obedient to him as king.

Some of you are being very, very obedient to him as king, and yet you're just full of guilt and anxiety and burdened and you're burdened down with a horrible view of yourselves, because you just really don't have a good grasp of Jesus as redeemer and priest. Don't just say, you know, these three things, that's why we're spending a couple of weeks on each, a couple of sermons on each. He's the prophet, he's the priest, he's the king.

> 耶稣既是人又是神，这是基督教的核心教义之一。> 他作为先知、祭司和君王的身份，构成了他的工作三大方面。

--- 通过这样的理解，我们可以更全面地认识耶稣基督，并在我们的信仰生活中更好地应用这些真理。当我说有三件事，耶稣在圣经中的每一句话、每一个行为都可以归入这三种之中。而这三种分类之所以重要，是因为它们至关重要。如果你忽略了其中任何一种，或者只看到其中的两种而忽视第三种，都会导致对他的理解扭曲。

这种扭曲会歪曲你对现实的看法。如果将这些观点带入你的信仰体系中，绝对不是基督教，并且是精神上的毒药。让我给你举几个例子。当我们说先知、祭司和君王时，所谓“先知”是指他是一位启示者，传达真理的人。

他是上帝的启示者，揭示了上帝是谁以及他的旨意是什么。其次，他是“祭司”，**这意味着他是救赎者。**作为代表，他来为我们代求。作为先知，他代表上帝向我们说话；但作为祭司，他则代表我们向上帝父神说话。

他成为我们的替代者，在我们的位置上受死。你看，他引领我们来到上帝面前，是我们的辩护者和代表。他是我们的救赎者。所以首先，他是先知、启示者；其次，他是祭司、救赎者。

最后，他是君王、统治者。他命令我们，我们必须对他忠诚无比。他是我们生命中的最高权威。因此，耶稣是先知、祭司和君王：启示者、救赎者和统治者。

现在让我给你展示一下如果忽略了其中任何一种会怎样。我在纽约遇到过很多人，我一直在思考这个问题，因为我读了一本书。我会再提到这本书。丹·沃克菲尔德写的《1950年代的纽约》描述了50年代初在哥伦比亚大学求学并住在格兰特村的一代人。

你了解，那是一个作家，总之，我注意到一件事：我在读这本书时意识到，我遇到过很多从中西部来到纽约市的人。在中西部，他们在许多情况下接受了相当传统的基督教教养。但到了纽约，他们完全抛弃了这一切。他们鄙视童年的宗教信仰以及中产阶级美国的价值观，而是投身于纽约的智力、文化和种族多样性之中，并自认为比自己来自的地方优越得多。

我经常和这些人交谈，你们知道是哪一类人。他们会说：“我不去教堂，基本上按照我觉得应该的方式生活，我现在也不太知道自己相信什么了。”但他们仍然记得小时候做出的决定：那时我还是个孩子，我为耶稣基督做出了选择，现在我还觉得他真的属于我，他一直伴随着我。换句话说，我的感觉、经验和情感现在成了我的国王和先知。

也就是说，我自己拥有真理，自己决定哪些对我来说是真实的，并决定如何生活。但我想保留这样一个耶稣的形象——救赎者。我不想把他当作国王或先知，也不想让他告诉我什么是真实，也不想接受他的任何命令。我只是喜欢他爱我、原谅我并且永远与我同在的想法。

好吧？这并不是基督教。这是某种东西，但它不是基督教。你不能只把耶稣当作祭司而不作为先知和君王。

你不能只把他当作救赎者而不作为启示者和统治者。我是提摩西·詹姆斯·基勒，如果有人对我说：“进来吧，提摩斯；出去吧，詹姆斯；留下吧，基勒。” 我会陷入困境。我不会说，嗯，我是某种整体的东西。

我不知道自己哪一部分是“雅各”的部分，也许是我的左臂。也许你可以拥有那部分。这并不起作用。我就是全部的提摩太。

我就是全部的雅各。我就是全部的凯勒。而他则是全部先知、祭司和君王。他不能只拥有一部分自己。

让我再举一个例子，但我会更简洁一些：有很多团体，我想说教会吧，也有很多团体喜欢耶稣这个概念。他们对耶稣作为国王和指挥官的理解非常深刻。但他们对耶稣作为救赎者、辩护者的理解却相当薄弱。在那些以律法为中心的团体里，你知道，你会不断地听到“耶稣说”、“耶稣说”，这种说法非常生动。

它被以一种富有想象力和生动的方式传达出来，但关于他的救赎、恩典和爱的任何讨论都只是抽象的概念。没有耶稣作为先知和祭司的身份，那将是一个可怕的境地。然而，这并不是**真正的耶稣。现在再举一个例子：就像那些以律法为中心的人只喜欢耶稣作为国王而不喜欢他作为祭司一样，那些放纵的人则只喜欢耶稣作为祭司而不喜欢他是**国王或启示者的概念。

所以今天有很多人： 他们并不真正接受耶稣是先知、祭司和君王的身份。换句话说，他们会说：“我相信耶稣是一位伟大的教师，他向我们揭示了很多关于上帝的知识。” 但“我不能接受他作为一个神的救世主、神圣的国王等这些想法。” 现在，最著名的例子之一就是现代基督教文学中的一段著名篇章，在《基督教名言》一书中，C.S.刘易斯指出，你不能只认为耶稣是一位先知。

他说：“这个先知的问题在于，耶稣基督这位先知来的时候说：‘我是上帝，你们要崇拜我。’” 我独自有權赦免你們的罪。你對我的看法將決定你終身所處之地。所以，這個人來了，帶著這些難以置信的主張。

說他是神，並且必須成為你生命中的最終权威，以及你將在他身上或他身上的石頭上或是墮落或是升天等等。因此，路易斯說了一個很顯而易見的道理：如果他所聲稱的一切都是真的，那麼他要么遠超先知，要么遠不及先知，但絕對不能僅僅是一個先知。他若是遠超先知，因為他曾聲稱自己如此；或者他瘋狂、撒謊、愚蠢，成為一個遠不及先知的人。無論如何，他不會讓你相信他只是個先知而沒有成為祭司或君王的能力。

難道你看不到嗎？如果你試圖抓住其中任何一項，或是只接受其中兩項而拒絕另一項，甚至只是對某項有些模糊的理解，這都會在你的生命中引入扭曲。事實上，我認為我可以創建一個網格，作為牧師幫助人們理解他們的基督徒生活何處出錯。我這裡指的是基督徒。

大多數情況下，如果我們審視自己的基督徒生活並問自己：哪裡出了問題？在哪裡需要成長？在哪裡有信仰上的裂縫、崩潰或腐朽、弱點？通常你會通過這個網格來找到答案。

很常見的是，我們對耶穌作為其中某個角色有很好的理解，而對其他角色的理解則較差。你們中有些人非常熱衷於聖經研讀，認為耶穌是先知的觀念很棒。你們喜歡研究他的教義，並非常熟悉這些教義，但卻沒有遵從他作為君王的要求。有些弟兄姊妹非常、非常地顺服他作为君王，但你们心里却充满了罪疚感和焦虑，背负着沉重的负担，因为你们对耶稣作为救赎者和大祭司的理解并不深刻。

不要只是说这三点理由，我们知道这一点，所以我们要花几周的时间来讲解每个主题，讲几次道。他是先知、他也是祭司、他更是君王。现在，我已经为这个月设定了背景，今晚我想强调的是，虽然他远不止是一个先知，但他确实是先知，那这又意味着什么呢？让我读一段经文吧，不管信不信，请听圣经中的这段话。

## 何为先知？ / What Is a Prophet?

Now, having said that, and I just sort of set the context for the entire month, tonight, I would like to say, even though he's far more than a prophet, he is a prophet, and what does that mean? Let me read, believe it or not, have a scripture text, yes. Let me read from Acts chapter three, verse 17 to 26.

Now, I just gave you the introduction to the month. Now, Acts chapter three, verse 17 to 26, read it, and there's two basic things that we want to draw out of this, that tells you something about Jesus as the great and ultimate prophet and revealer of God to us. In Acts three, it reads, start in verse 17, this is Peter preaching.

He says, now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance as did your leaders, but this is how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, saying that his Christ would suffer, repent then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, and that times of refreshing may come from the Lord, and that he may send the Christ, who has been appointed for you, even Jesus. He must remain in heaven until the time comes for God to restore everything, as he promised long ago through his holy prophets. For G-Moses said, the Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people.

You must listen to everything he tells you. Anyone who does not listen to him will be completely cut off from among his people. Indeed, all the prophets from Samuel on, as many as have spoken, have foretold these days, and you are heirs of the prophets and of the covenant God made with your fathers.

He said to Abraham, though your offspring through your offspring, all peoples on earth will be blessed, and when God raised up his servant, he sent him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways. Now, what do we see here? First of all, we see the obvious, and that is that Jesus Christ is a prophet.

It says, Peter says, Moses had prophesied, the Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like unto me, said Moses. From among your own people, you must listen to everything he tells you. Anyone who does not listen to him will be completely cut off.

Now, what Moses is saying is, you think I was a good prophet, there is a prophet to come to beat all prophets. He will be like me, and yet he will be so supreme in his authority, so seminal in his authority and his truth, that your relation to him will completely determine whether or not you're accepted or cut off. So, and Peter says, this is Jesus.

Jesus is the one who's coming. And, you know, what does it teach us? All right, first of all, the fact that Jesus is a prophet, not just a priest in a king, but a prophet, shows us that we have a God who speaks to us.

Now, I want you to know that ever, ever since, the beginning of time, it seems like human beings have wanted desperately to have a universe to talk to them, to have a universe to talk back to them. If you read our literature and you look at our songs from the very beginning, we have been always imagining talking trees and talking animals. And even in our science fiction, we imagine other races, you know, from other planets, we're desperately afraid of the idea that maybe we're the only speakers in the world.

But maybe it's an impersonal and silent universe. Maybe at bottom there's nobody to talk to. There's no rational, there's no rational other.

And the Bible says that's not true. The reason you believe that there is, the reason you want so desperately to have someone else to talk to is because there is. One of the things I loved about Leonard Bernstein was he said, you know, I don't believe the Bible, I don't believe that sort of thing.

And yet, remember, he says, when I listen to Beethoven, remember the great quote, I don't, that's why I'm reading it. He says, when I listen to Beethoven, he says, Beethoven leaves us with a feeling that something is right in the world, that something checks throughout, that something follows its own laws consistently, something we can trust, something that will never let us down. In other words, he says, you know, I don't believe in absolute truth.

I don't believe an internal body of truth that's internally coherent, that's absolutely consistent to its own inner laws, that's something that we can trust that will never let us down, that checks throughout. And yet, when I hear Beethoven, I feel like it must exist. And the Bible says, the reason that you want to believe in talking trees, the reason you want to believe there's a universe out there to talk to you, there's a rational center that can talk back to us is because there is.

The reason that you, even when you intellectually, say, I reject the whole idea of absolute truth, I reject the idea of a guy who speaks to us, when I talk, when I listen to Beethoven, I know how that there's something else, that we're not all alone, rational in an irrational universe, personal in an impersonal universe, speakers in a silent universe. I can't believe that. Well, the Bible says the reason you can't believe it, the reason that you want to believe it, where did you get the idea?

It's because it's true, because you know it, because there is a God who speaks, and he speaks to Jesus, when Jesus was transfigured, remember the transfiguration on the mount of transfiguration, the apostles who were there saw Jesus, and they saw Moses on the one side, and Elijah on the other, prophets, and Jesus standing in the middle. And a voice came down from heaven, remember what it said? This is my son, says God, hear ye him.

Hear ye him. You cannot relate to Jesus Christ as some kind of mystical figure. He is a teacher, he is a prophet, he brings truth, and you have to your relationship with the Father is through a prophet, and that means that your relationship with God is not just a mystical kind of oneness, it is a relationship based on communication and an acceptance of that communication.

It's rational, it's orderly, there's a body of truth that this prophet brings, and that's the basis of your relationship. You can't just commune with God by going out into beautiful spots, you know, of nature, and just kind of feeling his presence. That's not the way you relate to God as a Father.

This is my beloved son, hear ye him. He's a prophet. Now, the two things I just like to talk about, just the two aspects, is what it means, what a prophet is, anyway, what does the Bible mean when it talks about prophets?

So first of all, what are prophets, and then secondly, why is Jesus the ultimate prophet? Why is he the final? I'll show you, the Bible teaches, he's the final prophet.

That's a big difference between Christianity and other religions. Islam will tell you Jesus was a prophet, but they will not grant that he was the final prophet. And there's a lot of other religions that will say Jesus was a prophet, but they will not grant that he was the final prophet.

That's the place where Christianity diverges from others. They say that Jesus Christ reveals God in an unsurpassable way and brings a disclosure of God that can't be topped. And here's the reasons why.

But anyway, let's take a look, these two things. What are prophets? What does the Bible teach us about prophets and why is Jesus the ultimate prophet?

Number one, what are prophets? You see, it says in the word is mentioned a number of times in the passage. Jesus is the prophet that Moses was talking about, but it also tells us a great deal about what prophets did.

Look, in verse 18, if you have something to look at, it says, this is how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets. Now you see, if you want to know what a prophet is, a prophet is a mouthpiece for God. God foretold these things through the prophets, doesn't say the prophets foretold.

Sometimes it does, but it tells us that whatever the prophet says is what God says. Now if you want the best definition, biblical definition of prophecy and what a prophet is, you can go back to an interesting place where Moses is being told by God to go and speak to Pharaoh. And Moses says, you don't understand.

I'm very inarticulate. I don't like crowds. I get scared when I get up on a platform.

I can't take it. So what does God say? He says, fine.

Aaron's better than it, you know, it's speaking to you. So he says, quote, this is an Exodus 7, I will make you like God to Pharaoh and Aaron, like a prophet to you. So whatever you say, Aaron will say.

See, now modern people don't believe what the Bible says about prophecy. Modern people will say, okay, here are the prophets and they have written what the Bible says, the prophets have written, there's Isaiah and here's Hosea and here's Obadaya and here's all these prophets. Well, how do we regard them?

We say those are men who have interpreted, they have interpreted, they're giving us their interpretation of who God is. And that's great. We might learn from them, but of course, we all have the right to make our own interpretations about what God has said too.

And so the idea is sort of like this. Let's just say Shostakovich has written a new symphony, but I don't think he can, isn't he dead? But anyway, but let's just say he has, he's dead, or if he's not dead, he's certainly probably not writing any symphonies anymore.

So you are a critic for the paper and you go to hear this symphony and you listen and you're all done, you sit down, you write your column and you say, well, you know, I think that the first, I think that the first movement is a man in bondage, yes, a man in slavery. And I think the second movement is a man in liberation, a man liberating himself from bondage. And so you write this down and so on.

And that's how many people say we should understand prophets. Prophets are people who wrote in the Bible like Isaiah and Hosea and people like that. And they wrote down their interpretation.

They say, well, I think God is like this and I think God is like that. Well, everybody has a right to their own interpretation, right? However, what if you ask Shostakovich to write the review of his symphony for the paper?

And you said, Mr. Shostakovich, tell us, what were you trying to say in the first movement? What were you trying to say in the second movement?

And he writes it down. And you see, that's a very different thing than when the critic interprets it. Here you have the author saying something and it kind of gets rid of the whole idea.

You know, if you're, how can you debate what Shostakovich had in his mind when he wrote the first movement of that symphony? You can't debate it over. We have it right from his mouth now.

Do we understand when the prophets write something in the Bible? Should we understand it as a critic interpreting what the composer meant? Or do we interpret really as nothing more than the very ideas and words of the composer simply through the mouthpiece of the prophet?

And the Bible says very clearly, it says, especially in 2 Peter, chapter 1, verse 13, no prophecy of Scripture is by the prophet's own interpretation, but prophets spoke from God not of their own will as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. Period. You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger brother.

In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who try to earn his love by being good. In his book The prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental older brother, and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal, extravagant grace. Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith, The prodigal God will help you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way.

The prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the hope and joy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the world. Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com-slashgive. That's gospelandlife.com-slashgive.

Now, here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching. Now I know, one reason I'm putting this out, we have to bring this up every so often.

This idea of truth is utterly repugnant to the modern mind, and we're modern people and we live in a modern community, maybe the most modern city anywhere. And yet that's what it means when the Bible says Jesus was a prophet, and that's what it means when it says the Bible is a word of prophecy. Prophets are simply bringing you the very words of God.

That's why it says there in verse he foretold through the prophets. What the prophets say? God says.

And therefore the idea of truth is in Christianity is this is objective truth. This is not an interpretation of what God thinks. This is what God thinks.

It's possible to know what God thinks. Well, I tell you, it's so easy for for people to say the idea that you can know what God thinks. Who do you think you are?

Christians are often told this. You think you know what God thinks. Who do you think you are?

And the only thing you can say at some point is yes, I do believe that our God is knowable. I do believe that our God speaks. I do believe that our God is not a hidden God.

I do believe that our God is not hiding from us. You do. That's the difference.

It's not a matter of pride. I think you can know what God thinks about certain things. Because I believe there's a God who speaks.

Not just the God who's out there, not just the God who's out there, but a God who speaks.

让我们从使徒行传第三章第17节到26节开始。现在，我已经为这个月做了引言。请阅读使徒行传第三章第17至26节，并从中提炼出两点主要信息，这将帮助我们了解耶稣作为伟大的最终先知和上帝启示者的身份。在使徒行传三章中，彼得说： “弟兄们，请听我说：我知道你们和你们的首领都是无知地行事；然而，正如神藉众先知所说的话，要成就这些事，现在就应验了。

你们应当悔改，向神祈求，使你们的罪得赦，这样那安舒的日子可以来到，主也必差遣被膏的那一位降临人间，在我所定的时候、日期，你们预先所知道的。” 他必须被送到死地，又从死里复活。因为摩西曾说过：‘主耶和华要兴起一位像我这样的先知，他的事工要在你们中间成就。’凡呼求他名字的人，无论男女老少，都要听从他的教训。

谁若不听从他的话，必在百姓中受咒诅。那时，众先知从撒母耳起，直到最后一位先知所说的，都已应验了；神已经向你们的祖宗立约说：‘要从你们弟兄中间为我兴起一位先知，要听从他的话。’ 他说：“你的后裔必有一人要从你那里出来，作众民族的祝福；我要使万民都因他得福。”当神举立他的仆人时，他就先差遣他到你们这里来，为要给你们施恩，使你们各人都回转归向自己的罪孽。

现在我们看见了什么？首先，我们看到显而易见的一点是：耶稣基督是一位先知。彼得说：“摩西曾写着说：‘主耶和华必从你们弟兄中间为你们兴起一位像我这样的先知，凡我所说的，他都要对他们说。’谁若不听这先知所要讲的话，必要从民中全然剪除。

” 摩西的意思是，你以为我是好先知？还有一位先知要来胜过所有先知。他和我一样，但他的权威、他的真理如此卓越，以至于你对他的关系将完全决定你是被接纳还是被剪除。彼得说，这就是耶稣。

耶稣就是那位要来的先知。那么这教导我们什么呢？首先，耶稣是一位先知，而不是仅仅一位祭司或国王，表明我们的神是与我们说话的神。我要告诉你，从时间的开始以来，人类似乎一直渴望有一个宇宙能与他们对话，一个能回应他们的宇宙。

如果你阅读我们的文学作品和歌曲，你会发现从一开始我们就一直在想象会说话的树木和动物。甚至在科幻小说中，我们也设想来自其他星球的种族，我们害怕可能我们是唯一的说话者。但也许这是一个冷漠无声的宇宙，也许根本没有人可以交谈。没有理性，没有理性的他者。

然而圣经说这不是真的。你之所以相信有他人可对话，是你如此渴望与他人交流的原因。有一件事我喜欢关于伦纳德·伯恩斯坦的是他说：“我不相信《圣经》，我不相信那种事。” 然而，记得他的话：当我聆听贝多芬时，请记住那句名言——虽然我要引用它，因为他说过。

他说，当聆听贝多芬时，贝多芬让我们感到世界是正确的，有一种秩序贯穿始终，有一种遵循自身法则的稳定感，一种我们可以信任的东西，永远不会让我们失望。换句话说，他说：我不相信绝对真理。我不相信那种内部一致、完全符合其内在法则的真实体系，那种我们能信赖且永不让我们失望的东西。然而，当我听到贝多芬时，我感觉它必须存在。

圣经说，你之所以想相信会说话的树木，之所以相信有一个宇宙在与你对话，有一个理性的中心可以回应我们，是因为它确实存在。即使你在理智上拒绝绝对真理的概念，拒绝有人对我们说话的想法，在我聆听贝多芬时，我知道有一种其他的东西存在，我们知道我们并不孤单。在一个非理性的宇宙中保持理性，在一个冷漠的宇宙中保持个人性，在一个沉默的宇宙中保持声音——我不相信这一点。圣经说，你之所以不相信它，却想相信它，是因为什么？

因为它是真的，因为你知道它，因为上帝说话了，并且在耶稣被圣化时向他说话。记得在西乃山上的圣化时刻，门徒们看到了耶稣，还看到摩西站在一边，以利亚站在另一边，先知们在场，耶稣站在中间。从天上传来了声音，你记得说了什么吗？上帝说：“这是我的儿子，你们要听他的话。

” 聆听他。你不能将耶稣基督视为某种神秘的存在。他是教师，是先知，带来真理，而你与天父的关系是通过一位先知建立的，**这意味着你与上帝的关系不是一种神秘的一致性，而是基于沟通和接受这种沟通。****这是理性的，有条理的；这位先知带来了许多真理**，这些构成了你们关系的基础。

你不能只是到自然美景中去感受他的存在来与上帝交流，这并不是作为父亲的上帝所希望的方式。这就是我亲爱的儿子，聆听他。他是先知。现在我要谈谈的两个方面是：先知是什么意思？

圣经中的先知指的是什么？为什么耶稣是最伟大的先知？首先，什么是先知？你看到，在这段经文中多次提到“先知”这个词。

耶稣就是摩西所说的那位先知，但同时它也告诉我们许多关于先知所做的事。那么，先知究竟是什么？圣经是如何定义先知的？为什么说耶稣是最终的先知呢？

首先，什么是先知？你看到，在这段经文中多次提到“先知”这个词。耶稣就是摩西所说的那位先知，但同时它也告诉我们许多关于先知所做的事。圣经中教导我们，先知是那些被上帝差遣来传达信息的人。

他们通过预言、劝诫和启示来引导人们认识上帝的旨意。例如，在《出埃及记》33章20节中，摩西问耶和华说：“求你显出你的荣耀给我看。” 耶和华说：“我要显我一切的恩慈，在你面前经过，宣告我的名。我要恩待谁就恩待谁；要怜悯谁就怜悯谁。

” 耶稣作为先知的角色是独一无二的。在《马太福音》17章5节中，当耶稣被神光照耀时，彼得说：“这是好的，我们在这里搭三座棚，一座为你，一座为摩西，一座为以利亚。” 但耶稣回答说：“你们要谨慎，不可将神的作为告诉人。” 这些经文表明，耶稣不仅是先知，而且是最终的先知。

其他宗教可能会称耶稣为先知，但他们不会承认他是最后一位先知。只有基督教宣称耶稣基督以无可比拟的方式揭示了上帝，并带来了无法超越的启示。让我们来看看这两个方面：什么是先知？圣经是如何定义先知的？

为什么说耶稣是最伟大的先知呢？首先，什么是先知？你看到，在这段经文中多次提到“先知”这个词。耶稣就是摩西所说的那位先知，但同时它也告诉我们许多关于先知所做的事。

看看第18节，如果有东西可以看的话，这里说的就是神如何应验了他借着众先知所说的预言。现在你明白了，如果你想知道什么是先知，先知就是神的代言人。神是通过先知预告这些事情的，并不是先知自己在预告。有时候确实如此，但圣经告诉我们，无论先知说什么，那就是神说的话。

如果你想得到最准确的定义——圣经中对预言和先知的定义，你可以回到摩西被神差遣去见法老的地方。摩西说他不行。他说：“我口拙，我不擅长在众人面前讲话，一上台我就害怕。” 我做不到。

那么神怎么说？神说：“好。” 神让亚伦去做这件事，你知道，就是对你说的。所以无论你说了什么，亚伦都会重复一遍。

现在现代人并不相信圣经中关于预言的说法。现代人会说，好的，这里有先知们，他们写下了圣经上的内容，这些是先知写的，比如以赛亚、何西阿和俄巴底亚等等。那么我们应该如何看待他们？我们会说他们是解释者，他们在为我们解释神是谁。

这很好，我们或许可以从他们那里学到东西，但当然了，我们也都有权自己去解读神所说的。所以这个想法大致是这样的。比如说肖斯塔科维奇写了一部新的交响曲，但他已经去世了，或者他没死，但肯定也不再创作交响曲了。你是一位报纸的乐评人，你去听了这部交响曲，听完之后坐下，然后写下你的评论说：“我认为第一乐章是一个被奴役的人，是的，一个奴隶。

我认为第二乐章是一个解放者，一个从奴役中解放自己的人。”然后你就这样写下去了。许多人就是这样理解先知的。先知就是像以赛亚、何西阿这样的圣经作者，他们写下自己的解释。

他们会说：“我觉得神是这样的，我觉得神是那样的。”每个人都有权有自己的解释，对吧？但是，如果你请肖斯塔科维奇为他的交响乐写一篇评论呢？你问他说：“肖斯塔科维奇先生，请告诉我们，在第一乐章里你想表达什么？

在第二乐章里又想表达什么呢？” 他写下自己的看法。你会发现，这和批评家的解释是完全不同的事情。这里作者直接说了话，这就完全改变了整个概念。

你知道吗，你怎么能争论肖斯塔科维奇写第一乐章时脑子里的想法呢？你无法争论这一点。我们现在就从他的嘴里得到了答案。我们是否应该理解先知在圣经中写下的话？

我们应该将其视为批评家解释作曲者的意图吗？还是说，我们真正需要的是直接理解作者——通过先知的口传达的思想和话语？圣经非常明确地告诉我们，在彼得后书1章13节中，它说：“没有一先知是按自己的意思说神的话语。”先知们从神那里说话，并不是出于他们自己的意愿，而是被圣灵感动。

句号。你知道浪子回头的故事吧，但这不仅仅是一个放荡的弟弟的故事。事实上，耶稣讲这个故事是为了对那些远离神的人和试图靠做好事赢得他爱的人说话。在《浪子的神》一书中，提摩西·凯勒展示了这个广为人知的故事如何揭示福音的核心——一个既是对叛逆的弟弟也是对苛刻的哥哥都有希望的信息，并邀请所有人体验神那慷慨、无尽的恩典。

无论你是基督徒还是还在探索信仰，《浪子的神》都会帮助你以全新的视角看待与基督的关系。重生的神是我們感謝你們本月對福音和生命的捐款，幫助我們將基督仁慈不倦之愛的信息和希望與喜樂傳給全世界的人。請訪問 gospelandlife.com/give 訂閱您的捐款。那正是 gospelelandlife.com/give。

現在，让我们听戴德生博士今天的教导。我知道，我之所以强调这一点，是因为我们必须时不时地提到它。真理这个概念对现代思想来说是极其令人反感的，而我们就是现代人，生活在现代社会，也许是最现代化的城市之一。但圣经说耶稣是一个先知时，这就是它的意思；当圣经称其为预言之书时，这也是它的意思。

先知只是将上帝的话语带给你。因此，在基督教中，真理是客观真理，而不是对上帝看法的解释。这是上帝的看法。确实有可能知道上帝的想法。

我告诉你，人们说你能知道上帝的想法，这真是太容易了。你以为你是谁？基督徒经常听到这种说法：“你认为你知道上帝的想法？你以为你是谁？

” 但最终你只能回答：我相信我们的神是可知的。我相信我们的神在说话。我相信我们的神不是隐藏的。我相信我们的神没有隐藏于我们。

这是区别所在。这不是一种傲慢。我认为你可以知道上帝对某些事情的看法，因为我知道有一个会说话的神。不只是一个远在天边的神，而是一个会说话的神。

## 两种对立的世界观 / Two Rival Worldviews

Now, Christians will always find when they come to understand this view of prophetic truth that that God has spoken, that God gives us objective truth. You're going to find that there's two very different alternate worldviews really competing with Christianity in a city like New York.

Every so often, you know, I mention these two basic competing worldviews and unfortunately, every time I give them different names, so a lot of you probably think there's seven or eight. But the two of them are, you know, let me give you all the different names. The one is sometimes people, sometimes we call it naturalism because it's the view that nature is all there is.

Sometimes we call it secularism that says, you know, there's nothing, there's no spirit, there's no supernatural. All we have is what is matter. All that's all.

And on the other hand, besides naturalism or secular scientism, you've got pantheism. Pantheism, which means God is in everything. I also sometimes call it new ageism.

Confuses everybody. And they seem very different. The one view says there is no God.

Nothing is God. The other view says everything is God. God is a force in all of us.

And therefore, the first view says there's really no truth, only facts. We know scientific facts, but there's no truth. There's no reality.

You see, there's no ultimate reality. Bertrand Russell says, when the universe dies, all the civilization will go. So there's no right and wrong.

There is no spirit. There is no purpose or meaning in life. And he says, only if you build your life on the knowledge of that.

Only if you build your life on, he says, the foundations of unhealing despair will you be safe. Don't believe any humbug about there being meaning. Don't believe any humbug that there's right and wrong.

We're just made of molecules, period. That's the one view. The other view says, oh, no, God is in everything.

In fact, you are God. And what it says is, we have to alter our consciousness, move into a new state of consciousness, and look inside of ourselves to get in touch with our own greatness, our own potential, our own creativity. Now, they sound very different and very often they hate each other and they have fights on cable television.

They fight with each other. You see, the one group, you know, one group it believes, it's funny. The one group believes nothing and the other group believes everything.

The one group believes in nothing and the other group says, what, to row cards, you know, crystal balls, channeling, you know, and you know, worshiping nature, yeah, yeah, you know, everything. One group believes in nothing, one group believes in everything. One group says there is no God, one group says everything is God.

And they seem very different. But here's where they in practice, in practice, it comes out of the same thing. They both come down to this.

You are your own truth finder. You are your own truth bringer. On the one hand, you see a Bertrand Russell will say, you decide how you want to live.

There's no right and wrong. On the other side, they say, well, you have to look into yourself and find out what you really are and who you really are. But when it comes right down to it, in both cases, there's no truth outside that we have to submit to.

You're your own truth finder, you're your own truth bringer. And I, listen, the one view sounds so noble. You know, they say to us, they say to Christians, yes, if you need a belief in God to face the meaninglessness and despair of life, well, okay, you know, you, they seem, it seems so noble.

It seems so, you know, they seem so strong and courageous. On the other hand, the pantheistic, the new ageistic people, they seem so exotic. So positive, so profound, you see.

But I would suggest that there are some very crass motives that people have to reject the Christian idea of truth because at the very bottom, there is a childish side of us that doesn't want anybody to tell us what to do. And as intellectual and as noble and as positive as profound as it sounds, it plays right into those crass motives, right into the hands of those crass motives. The book I was reading by Dan Wakefield called New York in the 50s.

Dan Wakefield was a guy from the Midwest and he came to Columbia University and he started reading the existentialist and he began to realize that the universe was a cosmos was meaningless and that existence was absurd and everybody had to find their own truth, you know. And so he went down into the village and he began to live any old way he wanted. And he said, you know, he would get his friends would come from Indiana.

One time he had a woman come from Indiana and they spent a couple weeks with him and said, she says, Danny, New York is so intellectual. New York is so sophisticated, so anonymous, I don't know what's in to commit first. And he said, you know, really what New York gave us was an intellectual construct to justify doing all the things our parents back in Indiana would never let us do.

And so people, a lot of people say, oh, you know, Christians, you've got motives for wanting to believe in Christ. You've got motives for wanting to believe that the Bible is really the word of God. You want authority in your life.

You want certainty in your life. Yeah, sure. That's true.

So there's motives there. What about your motives for rejecting the concept of truth? You see, you've got tremendous motives.

People come, especially college kids, they just love either to buy into naturalism or pantheism. Why? Because now I can do all the things my parents would never let me do.

Finally, I can do whatever I want. There's nothing more crash in that and there's nothing more childish than that. Put it this way, your eight year old comes home having played baseball.

And he says to you, boy, I got into kind of a fight. Why, honey? Well, I was rounding third and this boy tripped me.

Well, what did you do? I got up, I grabbed a big rock and I threw it as hard as I could write it as head and it just missed him. He got very upset and we had a fight.

So you say, son, that was absolutely and totally wrong. What he did was wrong, but what you did, you could have killed him. It was disproportionate.

It was all out of proportion. It was wrong, always wrong. It's how you're going to ruin your life if you have a contemporary like that.

You're going to ruin your life if you think you can respond like that. So what does your son say? You weren't there.

You don't know. Who do you think you are to tell me what to do? I mean, that's the way the heart works, you see.

That's the essence of the heart. So what do you say to the kid? You say, I'm 40, you're eight.

I am from above. You are from below. I can see things that you can't see.

Absolutely serious. I know it's funny. It is funny.

You can laugh, but it's totally serious. You say to the kid, I can see life from a vantage point that you can't even imagine. And therefore, unless you hear my word, if you reject my word, your life will be a wreck.

In John chapter 8, Jesus says, I am the light of the world and everything that I say is true. And if you reject my truth, you will die in your sins. And it says here, what does it say?

It says, the Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet, but this prophet will be different than all other prophets. This prophet will not be from below. This prophet will be from above.

And because he's from above, if you don't listen to him, you will be completely cut off. So what are we saying? The first point, and there's only two points.

Don't worry. The first point, the Bible says that there is objective truth, that Jesus Christ brings it, but all the prophets brought it. Now we're going to see in a minute why Jesus Christ is the ultimate bringer of truth, but the prophets bring a truth which trumps all other sources of information.

See, the other worldviews hate that idea. They say, well, we're all on competition. Oh, Isaiah, they have an interpretation of God, but so does Shakespeare, so does my English teacher, so do I.

Everybody has their own interpretation. The Bible says, no, there are some people who have spoken that are prophets, and they bring a truth which is from above. And therefore that truth trumps all other truth, all other source of information.

You've got your heart motions, right? You've got expert opinion, you've got your traditions that you were raised in, and you've got public opinion. Jesus' truth, God's truth trumps all other kinds of truth.

If it differs with public opinion, you have to follow it. If it differs with your feelings, you have to follow it. That's the nature of truth.

That's the nature of, that's what it means when the Bible says that there are prophets, that God has sent prophets, though you've murdered the prophets, when I sent them to you, he says, I will keep sending them to you because they bring the truth. You don't like the idea of a truth that trumps you, but it does. Now, one more thing about this.

I know that what I said sounds very harsh. The doctrine of God's truth, the idea of God's truth, the Bible gives us, it's hard, it's unyielding, it's got sharp edges to it, it's like chewing on a diamond, I know that. And yet, what about Beethoven?

We hate the idea that there is truth that no matter how much we want to do this, we're not allowed. That no matter how much we don't want to do this, we have to. That idea, we just hate it.

That's why we love to jump into the existentialists. We love to jump into the New Age, we love to jump into complete skepticism about any truth at all, you see. We just love that idea.

We hate the idea of it being a prophet. I know it sounds very harsh, but what are you going to do about Beethoven? Because you see, Pascal puts it this way, just as we have an incapacity for proving anything which no amount of dogmatism can overcome.

Hear that? He says, on the one hand, we really can't prove anything. Nobody can prove anything.

He says, on the one hand, we have an incapacity for proving anything which no amount of dogmatism can overcome yet. He says, we have a concept of the truth which no amount of skepticism can overcome. What I'm trying to say is, you look at the people, and maybe I know some of you are these people.

Look at the people who say, ah, there is no truth, like Bertrand Russell. And look at the people who say, well, truth is found within. Look at the people who say there's no such thing as objective truth.

And yet, every human being, every human being has a concept of truth that no amount of skepticism can overcome. We all know that some things are right or wrong regardless of what people believed. Isn't that right?

Some things are just wrong, we say. But if you don't believe in a God who speaks through the prophets, you've got no basis for that. You've got no basis for believing it.

And you can't help but believe it. You know there's a truth. You know there's a God who speaks.

Okay.

现在，当基督徒开始理解这种预言真理的观点时，他们会发现上帝已经说话了，他给了我们客观真理。你会发现，在像纽约这样的城市里，有两种截然不同的世界观与基督教竞争。每隔一段时间，我都会提到这两种基本对立的世界观。不幸的是，每次我都给它们不同的名字，所以你们很多人可能以为有七八种呢。

但其实只有两种。让我给你们列举一下这些名称吧。一种我们有时称之为自然主义，因为它认为自然界就是一切。另一种有时被称为无神论，它说，你知道的，没有精神，没有超自然的东西。

我们有的只是物质。而另一方面，除了自然主义或科学唯物主义之外，还有泛神论。泛神论的意思是上帝存在于万物之中。我有时也称之为新纪元信仰。

这让大家很困惑，而且它们看起来也很不同。一种观点认为没有上帝。没有什么是上帝的。另一种观点则说一切都是上帝。

上帝是我们心中的力量。因此，第一种观点认为其实并没有真理，只有事实。我们知道科学事实，但没有真理。没有现实。

你看，没有终极现实。伯特兰·罗素说过，当宇宙消亡时，所有的文明也将随之消失。所以没有对错之分。也没有精神。

生命中没有目的或意义。他说，如果你要安全的话，只能建立在这样的知识之上。他说，只有当你把生活建立在无法治愈的绝望的基础上时才会安全。不要相信任何关于有目的的说法。

不要相信有任何对与错的说法。我们只是由分子构成的，仅此而已。这就是一种观点。而另一种观点则说，哦不，上帝存在于万物之中。

实际上，你就是上帝。它认为我们必须改变意识状态，进入一个新的意识层面，并向内探索以接触自己的伟大、潜力和创造力。现在，这两种观点听起来很不同，而且经常互相憎恨，在有线电视上也会发生争执。它们彼此争斗。

你看，一个群体相信什么都没有，而另一个群体则相信一切都有。这一群人不信任何东西，另一群人则说，打牌、看水晶球、通灵、崇拜自然等等。一群不信任何东西，一群信什么都行。一群说没有上帝，一群说一切都是神。

表面上看起来很不同。但其实，在实践中，他们都是出自同一个根源。你是你自己的真理发现者，也是你自己的真理传播者。一方面，有人会引用伯特兰·罗素的话：你自己决定如何生活就好，没有对错之分。

另一方面，也有人说要深入了解自己，找到**真正的自我。但归根结底，在这两种情况下，我们都不需要接受外界的任何真理。你是**你自己的真理发现者，也是你自己的真理传播者。我告诉你，其中一种观点听起来很崇高。

他们对我们说，尤其是对基督徒们，如果你需要用信仰面对生活的无意义和绝望，那好吧，你们看起来确实很高尚勇敢。另一方面，泛神论的新时代信徒们看起来那么神秘、积极、深刻。但我想说的是，人们拒绝基督教的真理观念背后，有一些非常粗俗的原因。因为我们的内心深处有一种孩子气的想法，不愿意让别人告诉我们该怎么做。

无论这种想法听起来多么理智、高尚或积极深刻，它其实正是迎合了这些粗俗的目的。我最近读了一本书叫《1950年代的纽约》，作者是丹·韦克菲尔德。丹·沃克菲尔德是来自中西部的一个小伙子，他去了哥伦比亚大学，开始阅读存在主义哲学。他逐渐意识到宇宙是没有意义的，存在本身是荒谬的，每个人都必须自己寻找真理。

于是，他回到村里，过起了随心所欲的生活，并说：“你知道吗？我从印第安纳州的朋友都来了。” 有一次，一个女人从印第安纳州来，和他一起住了几周。她说：“丹尼，纽约真是太有思想了。

这里太有教养、太匿名，我不知道该做什么才能融入。”他说：“实际上，纽约给了我们一种智力上的框架，让我们为父母在印第安纳州不允许做的事情辩解。” 很多人说，哦，你们基督徒，你们想要相信基督，是因为你们需要权威和确定性。当然，这是真的。

那么，你们拒绝真理的概念时有什么动机呢？你们确实有巨大的动机。尤其是大学生们，他们特别喜欢接受自然主义或泛神论。为什么呢？

因为现在我可以做所有父母不允许我做的事情了。我可以随心所欲地做任何事。这太令人兴奋了，但也非常幼稚。用另一种方式来说，你八岁的儿子回家后告诉你，他和人打了一架。

你说：“怎么了？”他说：“我在跑垒时被绊倒了。”“那你做了什么？”“我捡起一块大石头，尽我所能砸向那个人，但只是擦过他的头，他很生气，我们因此发生了争执。

” 你对儿子说：“那绝对不对。他做错了，而你本可以杀了他，这完全不成比例，总是错误的。”这就是你如何毁掉自己生活的例子，如果遇到这样的当代人。你这样回应，只会毁了你的生活。

那你儿子怎么说？你不在场。你不知道。你以为自己是谁，来告诉我该怎么做？

要知道，这就是人心的作用。这就是心的本质。那么你会怎么跟孩子说呢？你说：“我40岁，你才8岁。

” 我是从上面来的，你是从下面来的。我能看见你所看不见的东西。这绝对不是开玩笑的。我知道这听起来很滑稽，但实际上是非常严肃的。

你可以笑，但这是完全认真的。你要对孩子说：“我可以从一个你无法想象的角度看待生活。”因此，除非你听我的话，否则如果你拒绝我的话，你的生活将会一团糟。在约翰福音第八章中，耶稣说：“我是世界的光，我说的话都是真实的。

如果你拒绝我的真理，你会死在罪中。”这里说了什么？它说：“主你的神要为你兴起一位先知，但这位先知与所有其他先知不同。他不是从下面来的，他是从上面来的。

” 因为他是从上面来的，如果你不听他的，你将会完全被隔绝。那么我们说的是什么呢？只有一个要点。不用担心，第一个要点是：圣经说有客观真理，耶稣基督带来了这种真理，但所有的先知也带来了这种真理。

接下来我们会看到为什么耶稣基督是最终的真理带来者，但先知带来的真理超越了所有其他信息来源。你看，其他的意识形态都讨厌这个想法。他们认为，我们都在竞争。哦，《以赛亚书》中有人对神有自己的解释，莎士比亚也有自己的解释，你的英语老师也有自己的解释，还有我自己。

每个人都有自己的解释。圣经说，不，有些人在上面说话，他们是先知，带来了从上面来的真理。因此这种真理超越了所有其他真理和信息来源。你有你的心动反应，对吧？

你有专家的意见，你有你成长中的传统，还有公众意见。耶稣的真理、神的真理超越了所有其他类型的真理。如果与公众意见不同，你必须遵循它；如果与你的感受不同，你也必须遵循它。这就是真理的本质。

这就是真理的本质，这就是圣经说有先知、上帝差遣先知时所要表达的意思，尽管你们杀害了这些先知，当我说他们被差派给你们的时候，他说：“我将继续差遣他们给你们，因为他们的信息是真理。”你不喜欢那种凌驾于你的真理，但确实如此。现在再补充一点。我知道我说的话听起来很严厉。

上帝真理的教义、上帝真理的概念，在圣经中给我们的是坚硬而不可动摇的，它就像咀嚼着钻石一样，我知道这一点。然而，贝多芬呢？我们讨厌这种想法：无论我们多么想做某事，都不被允许；无论我们多么不想做某事，都必须去做。这个想法是我们所憎恶的。

这就是为什么我们会喜欢存在主义者、新教徒和完全怀疑一切真理的人。我们喜欢那种对任何真理都没有概念的想法。我们讨厌先知的概念。我知道这听起来很严厉，但你又能怎样呢？

因为帕斯卡尔这样说过：正如我们无法证明任何事情一样，无论多么坚定的教条也不能克服这一点。听到了吗？他说，在一方面，我们确实无法证明任何东西；没有人能证明任何东西。他又说，在另一方面，我们有一种无法通过怀疑主义来克服的证明能力的缺陷。

我试图表达的是，你看那些人，也许我知道你们中有些人就是这样的人。看看那些说“没有真理”的人，比如伯特兰·罗素；看看那些认为“真理存在于内心”的人；看看那些说“客观真理不存在”的人。然而，每一个人都有一个无法通过怀疑主义来克服的概念——我们知道有些事情是正确的或错误的，与人们的信念无关。不是吗？

有些事情就是不对，我们说。但是如果你不相信通过先知说话的神，你就没有根据这么说。你也没有根据相信这些。而且你无法不去相信它。

你知道有真理。你知道有通过先知说话的神。好的。首先，我们学到神是通过先知说话的。

## 耶稣：终极的先知 / Jesus: The Ultimate Prophet

So first, we learn that God speaks through the prophets. But lastly, we also learn in this passage that Jesus is the ultimate prophet.

He's the final revealer of the truth. Why? You see, notice, even though he's a prophet, it tells us that he is what all the prophets were speaking of.

It says, this is how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, saying his Christ would suffer. Repent then and turn to God so that your sins may be wiped out. In other words, Jesus Christ is not only the subject of prophecy.

He's the object of prophecy. He not only brings the truth, but he is the truth to which all the prophets have always been pointing. And that means what makes him different and all your prophets is simple.

He is not just the one who brings the truth. He is the truth. Buddha, Mohammed, and Moses, and Abraham, all of them come and here's what they say.

They say, don't look at me. I am pointing to God. I'm pointing to the way to God.

Don't look at me. So I am nothing in myself. I am pointing to him.

Jesus is the first prophet who comes along saying, I am pointing to me. You can only find God through me. I am the way, the truth, the life.

No one comes to the Father, but by me. And it says in Hebrews chapter 1, verse 1, it's astonishing thing. It says, in the past, God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets in many times and in many ways.

But now he has spoken to us by his son, who is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being. That's just, you know, there is no parallel for such a statement. It says, why all other prophets, what they told us was piecemeal, every other prophet who has ever lived.

In fact, I could even go so far and say, every other prophet of any other religion comes and tells us true things. You know, they would never have gotten off the ground. I'm not saying, Muhammad says plenty of true things.

Buddhist is plenty of true things. They have to, you know, you do not get a religion off the ground unless there's a lot of truth in it, an awful lot. But Jesus is the only one who comes not saying pointing over his shoulder but pointing to his own heart.

He's the one that comes and says, they can tell you a lot about God, but I can show you God. So I am the ultimate revealer. Why?

Because all other prophets give us pieces of the truth in many ways and many places we heard, but now God has spoken in this final way. Why is it unsurpassed? Because he is the very radiance of his glory and the exact representation of his being.

And that's the reason why we have to say, how could anyone come after Jesus and add anything? How could he? Unless there's a fourth person to the Trinity and then it wouldn't be a Trinity, you see?

No, there are been prophets, you know, Muhammad came along afterwards that Jesus is a prophet, but I trump him. I'm the ultimate. I bring a higher view.

I bring a better view. Baha'u'la said the same thing. People have been doing it all the 20th century.

The only way you could really get away with that rationally is to say, I am God. In fact, I'm a better, I'm a bigger, I'm a better manifestation of the radiance of God's glory, and I'm a more exact representation of his being than Jesus. Nobody has ever dared make such a claim except people who are lunatics.

Why? You can't get away with it unless you are a heck of a moral, glorious character. You better be unbelievably great person.

Your wisdom and your beauty and your attractiveness and your compassion and your absolute consistency. Only Jesus has ever been able to claim that and get away with it because only Jesus had the life to match his claim. And therefore, he is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being.

And let me conclude by saying, he is not just a prophet because as God, he shows us who God is because he's so compassionate and loving in the way in which he talks and acts and moves. No, ultimately, Jesus is the ultimate revealer. Well, this is what's so great about why you can't move Prophet Priest and King away from each other.

He is the ultimate prophet because he's the priest and the king. On the cross, listen. Other prophets have told us, haven't they?

That God is holy. Other prophets have told us, haven't they? That God is love.

Prophets, in all religions, have come and said, God is holy. He is just. He hates evil.

He hates sin, right? And all the prophets have come and said, God is loving. God is compassionate.

And Jesus was no different. He came and he said, God hates sin. He also came and said, God loves you.

And he told the parable, the prodigal son. And he showed how when we come back to God, the father is so eager to have us back that he comes rushing to us before we can even get half of our repentance out of our mouth. He leaps on us and he kisses our neck.

Now, Jesus, like a prophet, told us those things. But Jesus, because he's a priest, is the ultimate prophet, because on the cross, he shows in a way that no prophet ever has or ever could. He reveals in a way that no prophet ever has or ever could.

The absolute glory of God, because he reconciles the holiness and love of God on the cross. The one place in history, the one place in the universe, where the holiness and the love of God shine out with equal brightness is on the cross. Because when you understand the logic of the cross, Jesus died for you.

So the more God poured out his wrath on sin, the more he saved us. On the cross and only on the cross, God is both just and justifier of those who believe. Only there is God's heart, his essence revealed.

Only the true glory of God. There is no other religion. There is no other prophet.

There's no other place anywhere that shows us that like that. Why? Because you say Jesus is more than a prophet.

And that's why he's the ultimate prophet. And I tell you that if you follow any other prophet and make any other prophet supreme, any other source of truth supreme over Jesus, you will either see the holiness of God or the love of God, but you'll never see them together. Never.

You'll either be either a legalistic person or lie sensuous person. You will be an unbalanced person, but you'll never hold it all together. You'll never see how they, the righteousness and the love of God, kiss and embrace and weep and fall on each other's neck, so that God can weep and fall on your neck.

Only this prophet says to the woman caught in adultery, I don't condemn thee, but yet he says go and send no more. How can he do both? The cross.

Only he do here do we have God, God who is just and justifier. It's unsurpassed. It's unbelievable.

Look into the face of this prophet. Look into the face of this God, of this of this prophet, Jesus Christ, and you will see the face of the Father. Is he?

Listen, Jesus says, this is my beloved son, here ye him. Let me ask you to conclude. Do you?

Do you just hope that Jesus will kind of love you, but you don't want to study his teaching, master his teaching? You really don't like the idea that he has the right to tell you what to do? I tell you something.

Do you want him to redeem you? Do you want him to love you? Do you want him to open away to the Father?

You have to hear him. You have to listen to him. You've got to let his hard, unyielding objective truth into your life.

Are you willing to do that? Because he's all of these things or he's none of these things, but because he's all of these things, he shows us the Father. He's the absolute representation, exact representation of his being and the radiance of his glory.

Let's pray. Father, we thank you that all this is for us, we thank you that because Jesus Christ came and died, you can look at our sin and yet fall on our neck and say, put on my robe, put on my ring, let's kill the fatted calf, let's dance and sing for your mind, your home. Father, when we see Jesus Christ and only when we see Jesus Christ, are we able to really see you, only he reveals you, only he does.

Thank you for the uniqueness, thank you for the supremacy of his revelation of your being and of your radiance and of your glory. We pray that tonight, the two things we might learn is that we need to study the Bible, we need to study, here's the scripture, we need to know it inside out. But on the other hand, that your son, Jesus Christ, is the supreme and ultimate prophet and his truth trumps all of the truths and the picture that he gives us of you is the supreme picture that's possible.

We thank you for this great disclosure and we ask that you would help us to take it in to our own lives and be changed by it. No one knows the Father except the Son and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him. In Jesus name we pray, amen.

但最后，在这段经文中我们也学到耶稣是最高的先知。他是最终揭示真理的人。为什么？你看，注意，虽然他是个先知，但圣经告诉我们，他就是所有先知所预言的对象。

它说，这就是神如何应验了他在所有先知口中所说的，他的基督要受苦。所以你们悔改归向神，使你们的罪得赦。换句话说，耶稣基督不仅是预言的主题。他是预言的目标。

他不仅带来真理，而且是所有先知一直在指向的真理本身。**这意味着什么让他与众不同，与所有的先知不同呢？他不只是带来真理的人。**他是真理本身。

佛陀、穆罕默德、摩西和亚伯拉罕，他们全都来了，并且说： 他们说，不要看我。我在指给你神。我在指引你通往神的道路。不要看我。

所以我自己什么都不是。我在指向他。耶稣是第一个这样来的先知，他说，我在指给我自己。只有通过我，你们才能找到神。

我是道路，真理，生命。没有人能到父那里去，除非经过我。希伯来书第一章第一段说，这真是令人惊讶的事。它说，在过去，神多次藉着众先知在各处对他们列祖说话。

但如今他藉着他儿子对我们说话了，他是神荣耀所发的光辉，是神本体的真像。这句话真是太惊人了。它说，所有其他先知告诉我们的都是片段的真理，事实上，每一个活着的先知， 甚至我可以更进一步地说，任何其他宗教中的每一个先知来告诉我们一些真实的东西。他们本来根本无法立足。

我不是说，穆罕默德说了许多真实的话。佛教中有许多真实的道理。他们必须有，你知道的，一个宗教要想站得住脚，就必须包含很多真实的东西，而且是大量的真实。但是只有耶稣与众不同，他不是指着别人而是指向自己的心来说。

他说：“他们可以告诉你很多关于神的事，但我能向你展示神。” 因此，他是终极启示者。为什么？因为其他先知以各种方式给了我们真理的碎片，在许多地方我们都听说过，但如今神已经用最终的方式说话了。

为什么它无可比拟？因为他就是神荣耀的光辉，是神本质的真实体现。因此，我们必须说，除了耶稣还有谁能再来添加什么？怎么可能呢？

除非有第四位进入圣三之中，那就不成其为圣三了，你明白吗？确实，后来也有先知出现，比如穆罕默德声称耶稣是先知，但他被超越。我是终极的。我带来更高的视角。

我带来更好的视角。巴哈欧拉也这么说。人们在20世纪一直在这样做。唯一能理性地说出这样的话的方式就是宣称：“我是神。

” 实际上，我是更伟大的、更完美的神光辉的体现，也是比耶稣更为精确地代表神的本质。除了疯子，没有人敢做出这样的声称。为什么？你必须是道德高尚、荣耀无比的人物，一个无与伦比的伟大人物才能做到这一点。

你的智慧、美丽、吸引力和同情心以及绝对的一致性。只有耶稣能够宣称这一切并得以实现，因为他的生活配得上他的声明。因此，他是神荣耀的光辉，也是神本质的真实体现。让我总结一下：他不只是先知，因为他作为神向我们展示了神是什么样子，因为他以极其慈悲、爱的方式说话和行动。

最终，耶稣是终极启示者。这就是为什么你不能将先知、祭司和君王分开的原因之一。他是终极的先知，因为他是大祭司和君王。在十字架上，聆听吧。

其他先知不是已经告诉我们了吗？上帝是圣洁的。其他先知不是已经告诉我们了吗？上帝是爱。

在所有宗教中，先知们都说，上帝是圣洁的，公义的，恨恶罪恶。他恨恶罪行，对不对？而所有的先知都说过，上帝是慈爱的。耶稣也是如此。

他来宣告说，上帝恨恶罪行；他也来宣告说，上帝爱你。他还讲了浪子回头的故事，展示了当我们回到上帝身边时，父亲是多么渴望迎接我们。他在我们还来不及完全表达悔改之意之前就跑过来拥抱我们，亲吻我们的颈项。耶稣像先知一样告诉我们这些。

但因为他是大祭司，所以是终极的先知。因为在十字架上，他以一种没有其他先知能做到的方式揭示了上帝的荣耀——在十字架上，上帝的圣洁和慈爱以同等光芒闪耀。只有在那里，你才能理解上帝公义与救赎的本质。只有那里，我们才真正看到了上帝的荣耀。

没有其他宗教，也没有其他先知能如此展现。没有任何地方能像这样向我们展示这一切。为什么？因为你认为耶稣不只是一个先知。

所以他是终极的先知。我告诉你，如果你跟随任何其他的先知，并将他们置于耶稣之上，你将会看到上帝的圣洁或慈爱，但绝不会同时看到两者。绝对不会。你要么成为一个律法主义的人，要么成为一个放纵情欲的人。

你会变得不均衡，但永远无法将这一切都掌控在手。你永远不会看到神的公义和爱如何相拥、哭泣、拥抱，以至于神可以为你哭泣并拥抱你。只有这位先知对那个被捉到的淫妇说：“我也不定你的罪。”但他又说：“去吧，从此不要再犯罪了。

”他怎么能同时做到这两点呢？是十字架。只有在这里我们才能看到神，一位公义且称义的神。这是无与伦比的，难以置信的。

看看这位先知的脸。看看这位神，这位先知耶稣基督的脸，你就能看到父神的脸。他是吗？听我说，耶稣说：“这是我的爱子，你们要听他的话。

”我问你们一个问题：你们愿意这样做吗？你们只是希望耶稣会爱你，但不想去学习他的教导、掌握他的教导？真的不喜欢他告诉你该做什么的想法吗？我要告诉你们一件事。

你们想要他救赎你吗？你们想要他爱你吗？你们想要他为你打开通往父神的道路吗？你们必须听从他。

你们必须倾听他的话。你们必须让他的坚硬而不可动摇的客观真理进入你的生命。你们愿意这样做吗？因为他是所有这些，或者他一个都不是，但因为他是所有这些，他向我们显明了父神。

他是父神绝对和精确的代表，是他荣耀的光辉。让我们祷告：天父，感谢你这一切都是为我们预备的，因为耶稣基督来受死，你可以看着我们的罪孽，却依然拥抱我们说：“穿上我的衣服，戴上我的戒指，宰杀肥牛犊，让我们欢歌跳舞吧。”天父，当我们看到耶稣基督时，只有当我们看到耶稣基督时，我们才能真正地看见你。只有他能揭示你，也只有他能做到这一点。

感谢你所赋予的独特性，感谢他对你存在、荣耀和光辉的启示。我们祈求今晚能学到两件事：**我们需要研读圣经，需要深入了解它；另一方面，耶稣基督是至高无上的先知，他的真理胜过一切其他真理，他给我们展示的关于你的形象是最高的可能。**我们感谢这次伟大的揭示，并恳求你帮助我们将这些道理融入我们的生活，从而被改变。除了父以外，没有人知道父，唯有子和愿意归向子的人才能知道父。
