## 引言与经文诵读 / Introduction and Scripture Reading

Welcome to Gospel in Life. What does it really mean to live in a way that reflects God's kingdom? For many of us, the kingdom can feel like an abstract idea.

But in today's teaching from the sermon on the Mount, Tim Keller shows how Christ offers us practical guidance for living out a compelling vision of a new kind of community shaped by grace. What are you? When people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me.

Rejoice and be glad because great is your reward in heaven. For in the same way, they persecuted the prophets who were before you. You are the salt of the earth.

But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled by men. You are the light of the world.

A city on a hill cannot be hidden, neither do people light up the lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead, they put it on its stand and give it light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before men that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.

Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets. I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will be by any means disappear from the law until everything is accomplished.

Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.

This is God's word.

欢迎来到《生命中的福音》。何为真正地活出上帝国度的样式？对于许多人来说，国度可能只是一个抽象的概念。但在今天从山上宝训中，提摩太·基勒（Tim Keller）向我们展示了基督如何为我们提供了实践性的指导，以实现一种新的社区愿景，这种社区由恩典塑造。

你是什么样的人呢？当人们侮辱你、迫害你，并且无端地对你恶语相加，说各种坏话是因为我。你们要欢喜快乐，因为你们在天上的赏赐是大的；因为在先知受逼迫的时候，你们也曾受过同样的对待。你们是世上的盐。

但若盐失去咸味，怎能再使它咸起来呢？它已经毫无用处，只好丢在外面被人践踏了。你们是世上的光。城建在山上不能隐藏，也没有人点灯后把灯放在斗底下；而是要把它放高处，好让进屋的人看见亮光。

同样地，你们的光也当这样照在人前，叫他们看见你们的好行为，便将荣耀归给你们在天上的父。不要以为我来是要废掉律法和先知；我来不是要废掉，乃是要成全。我实在告诉你们：就是到天地都废去了，律法的一点一画也不能废去，都要成全。凡打破诫命中一件最小的事，并教训人这样做的，将来在天国里必称为最小的；但凡遵行这些诫命，并教训人遵行的，将来在天国里必称为大的。

因为，我告诉你们：除非你们的义胜过文士和法利赛人的义，你们断不能进天国。这是上帝的话语。我们正在研读登山宝训，因为在接下来数周的时间里，我们要探讨基督徒生活的具体含义。当基督徒的生活得以实践时，它究竟有何不同？

## 基督教不是宗教 / Christianity Is Not Religion

We're looking at the Sermon on the Mount because we're going to look for a number of weeks at what it means to live the Christian life. How is the Christian life concretely different when it's lived out?

Now, last week when we looked at the first very first part of the Sermon on the Mount, the Beatitudes and the woes, we saw that the Christian life is based on a very different set of values in that of the world. And therefore, the first step in understanding the distinctiveness of the Christian life is to notice that it's distinct, the Christianity's distinct from the world and what all that means. We're not going back over that.

That was last week. But before you actually get into the specifics of Christian practice in the Sermon on the Mount, there is another distinction that has to be made or you won't get Christianity. Another introductory general basic distinction because Christianity is not just different from the world, Christianity is also distinct from religion.

You see where it says Pharisees and teachers of the law, in fact every place it says Pharisees and teachers of the law would help a lot if you just put in their religious leaders. And what Jesus is saying is Christianity is different than religion. Now this is key to understanding Christianity.

And it's a very helpful thing to think about this time of year. Swiss Theologian Karl Bart suggested this idea. He said there is an anti-Semitic way of speaking about the death of Jesus.

As some people out of anti-Semitic bias and feelings say the Jews killed Jesus. And Karl Bart says not only is that anti-Semitic, but it's nonsense. It doesn't help.

It's not illuminating. He says imagine somebody saying the Greeks killed Socrates. Well you'd say okay well Socrates was Greek, his enemies were Greek, his friends were Greek.

Of course Greeks would be involved in the death of Socrates. But that doesn't really, that's not specific and I wouldn't really tell me who killed Socrates when you say Greeks killed Socrates. And the same way Jesus was a Jew and his friends were Jewish and his enemies were Jewish.

So to say Jews killed Jesus. Of course Jews were involved. But it doesn't really, it's not specific and it doesn't really tell us who killed Jesus.

Karl Bart said who did kill Jesus? Religious people killed Jesus. He says not only do you see everywhere in the New Testament, a hostility by Jesus toward religion.

When Jesus gets near people from the world, when Jesus gets near worldly people, he's very patient, very kind. When he gets near religious leaders, he's very sharp. But on the other hand, it's religious people that were the most angry at what Jesus said over and over and over again.

The crowds, the Hoy Paloie, the common people of the world, they were fascinated with Jesus. Maybe they didn't believe what he said. But the religious people were angry.

And the one of the main points of the New Testament is you're never going to get Christianity unless you see that it is something utterly different than religion. Not only that, it's not just a key to understanding Christianity, it's a key to understanding the whole sermon on the mount. At the end of the sermon on the mount, both in its version we have in Luke, chapter 6, and its version we have in Matthew 5 to 7, you have at the very end of the sermon on mount, Jesus always ends by saying, now in summary and conclusion, I put before you these two ways.

Now, they're very famous statements. He says, there's two paths. One leads to life, one leads to destruction.

There are two trees, one has good fruit, but one has poison fruit. There's two houses, one is built on the rock and one is built on the sand. And what he's saying is, here you have two ways, two trees, two houses, two ways of life, and on the surface they look very, very much the same.

But one of the ways is poison. It poisons its eaters. It destroys its travelers.

It collapses on its residents. Now, what are those two ways? At the end of the sermon on the mount, what are the two ways that Jesus is putting in front of us?

Because it's not this tree, this tree. Not this way, this way, not this house, this house. What are they?

And traditionally, and I have to admit, I have done it too, as a preacher, traditionally, people read that and say, oh, what Jesus is saying is, you can either live, according to the sermon on the mount, you can live according to the law of God, the commandments of God, you can either obey God's laws, or you can disobey God's laws, see, life destruction, good fruit, bad fruit. You can either live obeying God's laws, or you can disobey God's laws. But a commentator changed my whole understanding of the sermon on the mount when he said, does it make sense that Jesus Christ would say, in summary, there are these two ways, and they look extremely alike, just that one of them has poison fruit, see, two houses, two ways, two trees.

It makes sense that Jesus would talk about two ways at the conclusion of a sermon and not have talked about those two ways in the sermon.

现在，上个星期我们回顾了登山宝训的第一部分，即福音和咒诅。我们看到基督徒的生活建立在与世界截然不同的价值观之上。因此，理解基督徒生活的独特性第一步就是注意到这一点：基督教不同于世界。上周我们就不再重复这些内容。

但在这具体探讨登山宝训中的基督徒实践之前，还有一个重要的区别需要指出，否则你无法真正理解基督教。因为基督教不仅不同于世界，它也不同于宗教。你看，在这里提到法利赛人和律法师，实际上每提到法利赛人和律法师的地方，都可以换成他们的“宗教领袖”。耶稣的意思是，基督教不同于宗教。

这一点对于理解基督教至关重要。而且在这个时间点上思考这个问题非常有帮助。瑞士神学家卡尔·巴特提出了这个观点。他说有一种反犹太主义的说法在谈论耶稣的死因。

有些人出于反犹太主义的情绪和偏见说“犹太人杀了耶稣”。卡尔·巴特认为，这不仅是反犹太主义，而且是胡言乱语，并没有帮助。它并不能阐明问题。他举例说，想象有人这样说：“希腊人杀死了苏格拉底。

”你会说：好吧，苏格拉底是希腊人，他的敌人也是希腊人，他的朋友也是希腊人。当然，希腊人会卷入苏格拉底的死因中。但这并不具体，我不会告诉你谁杀了苏格拉底，如果只是说“希腊人杀死了他”。同样地，耶稣是犹太人，他的朋友们也是犹太人，他的敌人也是犹太人。

所以如果说“犹太人杀了耶稣”，当然犹太人会卷入其中。但这并不具体，它并不能告诉我们谁真正杀了耶稣。卡尔·巴特说：“真正杀死耶稣的是宗教人士。”他说，在新约圣经中，你随处可见耶稣对宗教的敌意。

当耶稣接近世俗的人时，他非常耐心、非常慈爱。但当他接近宗教领袖时，却非常尖锐。另一方面，正是那些宗教人士一次又一次对耶稣说的话最为愤怒。世人、霍耶利、世界的普通百姓，他们被耶稣深深吸引。

也许他们并不相信他所说的。但是宗教人士却很生气。新约圣经的一个主要观点是：除非你认识到基督教与宗教完全不同，否则你永远无法真正理解基督教。不仅如此，这还是理解登山宝训的关键所在。

在登山宝训的结尾，在路加福音第六章和马太福音第五至七章中，耶稣总是以总结和结论的方式说：“现在我将这两条道路摆在你们面前。” 这些话非常著名。他说，有两条道路：一条通向生命，另一条通向毁灭。有两种树木：一种结出好果子，另一种结出毒果。

## 两条相似的道路 / Two Ways That Look Alike

Does it make sense if those two ways that he's putting in front of us, one of which he's in joining, and one of which he's warning us against? Does it make sense that those two ways would be good and bad, people that obey God's law, people who disobey God's law?

Because how would those both be two trees that look alike? How would those both be two houses that look alike? The commentator said, you've got to go back in and you go into the sermon on the mount, and see if he has, is the sermon on the mount how to live?

The Christian life simply is that it, or is the sermon on the mount contrasting these two ways? Are the two ways in the sermon, and they are, but the scary thing is it's not what you think. When you go in there, you're not going to see Jesus says, here's the people who obey God's law, and here's the people who don't.

Never. When you go through the sermon, here's what you see. First of all, you'll see him say, and this is a, we're going to get into this as the week's going on, but he doesn't say, here's people who pray, and here's people who don't pray.

No. He says, you pray like this, but you should pray like this. He doesn't say, here's people that give to the poor, and here's people who don't give to the poor.

No, he doesn't say that. He says, some people give to the poor like this, but I say, give like this. So they say, here's people who obey the 10 commandments, and here's people who don't.

No. He says, you hear the 10 commandments, the commandment thou shalt not murder. You obey like this, but I say obey like this.

Here's what the scary thing is. In the sermon on the mount, Jesus Christ is contrasting two ways. One is not good, and the other bad, they're both good.

In that, both groups of people are obeying the God's law. Both groups of people are following the 10 commandments. Both groups of people are praying.

Both groups of people are giving to the poor. Both groups of people are going to church, you know, worship. Both groups of people are studying the Bible.

And yet, one is poison. And you can see it right here in this very text. Look at verse 19.

Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. Whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. Look at that.

Notice both those groups of people in verse 19 are in the kingdom of heaven. Some are doing well, some are doing not so well, but they're both in. And then suddenly, verse 20, he says, however, there's the religious people, their righteousness, they're not in the kingdom of heaven at all.

He says, your righteousness must surpass their righteousness. And what he's saying is not, they're good in your bad, or you're good in their bad, but you're both trying to do the same thing. You're both trying to obey God.

However, what here's what Jesus is saying, Christianity is vastly beyond its surpasses religion. It's something utterly different than religion. That's what he's saying.

Don't mistake Christianity for religion. Don't mistake Christianity for going to worship and praying and giving to the poor. Don't mistake Christianity for that.

You can do all that and be poisoned. On your way to destruction. House on the sand.

That's what he's saying. Now does that scare you? It should.

I have been a poor communicator in these first few minutes. Because surely, surely, people are saying you're kidding, right? I thought Christianity was about, you leave the Amal lifestyle and you try to live according to the Bible in the example of Christ and the law of God, isn't that it?

The answer is no. That's part of it. That's involved clearly, but that's to miss the point.

The key is Jesus says, if you want to be in the kingdom of heaven, there's a way. There's a gospel goodness that vastly surpasses religious righteousness. How does it surpass?

Well, four ways and they build on each other. Gospel goodness surpasses religious righteousness in four ways. It's brighter because it's deeper.

It's deeper because it's sweeter. It's sweeter because it's higher. Gospel goodness surpasses because it's brighter and deeper and sweeter and higher.

有两种房屋：一种建在磐石上，另一种建在沙土上。他所表达的是，在表面看来它们看起来非常相似的两种方式中， 其中一条是致命的，它会毒害它的食用者，摧毁它的行路人，使居住其中的人倒塌。那么这两条道路是什么？登山宝训结尾处耶稣摆在我们面前的究竟是哪两条道路？

因为不是这条树，这条树。不是这条路，这条路。不是这座房，这座房。它们到底是什么呢？

传统上，包括我自己在内，作为传道人，人们通常会这样解读这段话：耶稣的意思是，你可以按照登山宝训生活，可以按照上帝的律法和诫命生活，你可以遵守上帝的法律，或者你也可以违背上帝的法律。看，一种是生命之树，结好果子；另一种是死亡之树，结坏果子。你可以选择遵守上帝的法律而生活，或者违背上帝的法律。但是一个评论家改变了我对登山宝训的理解。

他说：耶稣在总结时说有两种道路，而且这两种道路看起来非常相似，只是其中一种有剧毒果实。两种路，两座房子，两棵树，这真的讲得通吗？耶稣在一段布道结束时提到两条不同的道路，却没有在这段布道中讨论这些道路，这讲得通吗？如果他摆在我们面前的这两种道路，一种是他自己选择的道路，另一种是警告我们要远离的道路，那么这两种道路为什么一个是好的，另一个是坏的呢？

因为这两棵树怎么可能看起来一模一样？这两座房子怎么可能看起来一模一样？评论家说：你必须回到登山宝训中去，看看这段布道是否是在教你如何生活。基督徒的生活就是这个样子，或者登山宝训在对比这两种道路。

这些两条路确实存在，但可怕的是，并不是你想的那样。当你进入这段布道时，你会发现耶稣并没有说：“这里有遵守上帝律法的人，这里有不遵守上帝律法的人。” 他从没有这样说过。当你仔细阅读这段布道时，你会看到：首先，他会说，我们接下来会讨论这个话题，但他不会说，“这里有人祈祷，这里有人不祈祷。

”而是说，“你这样祈祷，但你应该这样祈祷。”他也不会说，“这里有施舍穷人的人，这里有不施舍穷人的。” 不，他没有这么说。他说：“有人施舍给人，像这样。

”但我说，“要这样行。”于是他们说：“这里有遵守十诫的人，那里有不遵守的。” 不对。他说：“你们听见有关杀人的律法：不可杀人。

你们遵行的是这样，但我告诉你们，要这样行。” 这里可怕的地方在于，在山上讲道时，耶稣基督在对比两种行为方式。一种不好，另一种更坏，但两者都是好的。在这其中，两组人都遵守了上帝的律法，都遵循了十诫，都在祈祷。

两组人都施舍给穷人，两组人都去教堂敬拜，研究圣经。然而，一种是毒药。你可以在这一段经文中看到这一点。看看第19节： 凡废掉神的一条命令，又教训人这样做的，将来在天国里要称为最小的；但凡遵行神意思的，将来要在天国里称为大的。

你看这里。注意第19节中的这两组人都在天国里。一组做得好，另一组做得不好，但他们都在里面。然后在第20节中，他说：“然而，那些自以为有宗教的人，他们的义却不足以进天国。

” 耶稣说：“你们的义必须胜过他们。”他并不是说“你的好在于他们的坏”，或者“他们的坏在于你的好”。而是说，你们都在努力遵行上帝的旨意。然而，耶稣在这里所说的，是基督教远远超越了宗教。

它是一种完全不同于宗教的东西。这就是他在说什么。不要把基督教误认为是宗教。不要把基督教误认为只是去敬拜、祈祷和施舍给人。

不要把基督教误认为这些。你可以做这一切，但仍然被毒害，走向毁灭。就像建在沙上的房子。这就是他所说的。

这是否让你害怕？你应该害怕。我一直是个糟糕的沟通者，在最初的几分钟里。因为肯定地，人们肯定会说你在开玩笑吧？

我以为基督教是关于离开阿马尔生活方式，尝试根据圣经和基督的例子以及上帝的律法生活，不是吗？答案是否定的。那只是其中一部分。这当然是涉及的内容，但这是错失了重点。

**关键是耶稣说，如果你想进入天国，有一条路。**有一种福音之善远远超越宗教的公义。它如何超越呢？有四种方式，并且它们彼此建立。

福音之善超越宗教公义，在四个方面。它更亮，因为它更深。它更深，因为它更甜美。它更甜美，因为它更高。

福音之善之所以超越，是因为它更亮、更深、更甜美、更高。

## 更亮：吸引世界 / Brighter: Attractive to the World

Number one, brighter. I mean, literally, it says, you're the light of the world. Notice there's two groups of people here.

There's people whose light doesn't say light and darkness. There's two groups of people doing good deeds. The one is doing it under a bowl and one's doing it in a way that the world is attracted and is delighted.

Therefore, the first difference between gospel goodness and religious righteousness, the first way for you to be able to tell the difference is in this relationship to the world. Christianity is attracted to and attractive to. Hear that?

I'm sorry, I don't know if I can get this through. Christianity is attracted to ED at the end and attractive to IVE at the end. People who you don't agree with, people who don't live the way you do, people who don't believe what you believe.

Christianity is attracted to and attractive to but religious people are turned off by, you see, and they are very, very, very alienating to people who disagree with them. Now here's what I mean, let's press this. First of all, Christians are attracted.

Notice where it says, they are salt. You are the salt of the earth. Now, what is salt?

Back in those days, the main thing salt did was a preservative. You didn't put salt into water because water doesn't go bad. You put salt into meat because meat's going bad.

It's falling apart unless you put salt in it. And what this is telling us is Christians by the nature of what their Christianity, when they see things falling apart, they get in there. When you see somebody emotionally falling apart, you go in like salt.

When you see a neighborhood socially or economically falling apart, you go in. Christians are attracted, deeds of love and mercy, in their salt. Religious people, however, they're under a bull.

What does that mean? Well, it means that they really want to stick together. They don't like being out there with all those people that differ.

They're not at all attracted to neighborhoods that are falling apart. They're not at all attracted to people that are falling apart. They look around and they pull their skirts in.

That's the difference between religiousness and Christianity. But not only that, Christians are not just attracted to, but they're attractive to people who disagree with them and who live a very different life and don't believe what they believe. Because notice, not only do you have the idea of light, beautiful light, but again, salt has another side to it.

The other job of salt was not just to be a preservative. It was also to make something taste good. Now, not about you, for example, I can't stand corn in the cobweb without salt on it.

But when I have eaten a piece of corn in the cob that I really like, I put it down and what do I say? Do I say, honey? That was great salt.

No, you said that was great corn in the cob. Why? Because the job of salt is not to make you think how great the salt is, but how great the thing is that it's involved with.

I mean, we push this along. What if you're salt in your small group Bible study? Well, if you're salt, people won't go away saying, boy, that person really, really knows the Bible had all the answers, showed me up.

No, what happens is when you go away from a small group in which you've been to salt, people don't go away saying, how great that person, they go away saying, what a great group. Now, this is pretty simple. See, salt makes you feel better about what you, in other words, the Christians make you feel better, religious people always make you feel condemned, make you feel worse.

And you have this place in chapter 7, a little later on in this terminal amount that you have a very famous place. Again, you can see right away, Jesus contrasting it two ways. He says, judge not, let's you be judged.

He says, you hypocrites, if you don't take a speck out of your brother's eye and miss the plank in your own eye, now what's all that about? Some people have said, well, that means you're not supposed to make moral evaluations. You're not supposed to try to persuade people that your religion is right.

It's judging. Now, of course, that's not true. Why?

Because to say, you mustn't make moral evaluations, is to make a moral evaluation, and to say you must not persuade people that your religious point of view is right, is to persuade that person that your religious point of view is right, which means it's impossible not to make it moral evaluations. How do we impossible? As soon as you say, let's not do it, you've just done it.

You have to do it in order to deny it. You have to use it. In order to even say, I'm not going to do it.

What is Jesus saying, then? Judging is doing moral evaluations with superiority or, let me press it, the Christian is somebody who always sees your own sin as a speck, as a plank, and the sins of other people as specks, religious people always see their own sins as specks, and everybody else as sins as a plank. That's the reason why religious people always make you feel worse, they make you feel condemned, and the reason why Christianity is salt and white.

Now, by the way, quick caveat before we move on, I didn't say Christianity, beliefs are popular. Oh, my goodness, no. I'm not saying that.

When I say the gospel goodness is attractive and attracting, I'm saying gospel goodness. I'm not saying the gospel. Gospel is still very repugnant to people.

As soon as you open your mouth about what you believe, you'll get some trouble. Here's the difference. If you have gospel goodness in you, you never, ever, ever act or feel superior to anybody else, especially the people who are different from you.

This is the reason, by the way, why your attitude toward New York City is one of the best ways to tell whether you're a Christian or a religious person. Because when you take a look at New York City, you're going to see two things. First of all, you're going to see some things falling apart, and religious people say who wants to live in there, which shows you have no saltiness at all.

They're going to say, in other words, religious people look around and say, what's wrong with these people? And see, which of course is my sin is a speck, your sin is a plank. And not only that, when you take a look around New York City, one of the things you can see right off the bat, you can see them just walking out.

You can look at some people and say, here's somebody who does not obey the ten commandments. It's not that hard to see. And Christians aren't turned off by that.

And religious people totally are. So the first point is, gospel goodness is brighter. It's attractive.

You say, why? Well, let's move on.

首先，更亮。我指的是，圣经上说，你是世上的光。请注意这里有两组人。

一组人的光不区分光明与黑暗。另一组人在做善事，其中一个是暗中做的，另一个是让世界吸引和喜悦的。因此，福音之善与宗教公义之间的第一个不同之处在于这种对世界的关係。基督教吸引并吸引人。

听到了吗？抱歉，我不确定我能否表达清楚。基督教吸引ED（end）并且吸引IVE（ive）。那些你不认同的人，那些不按你的方式生活的人，那些不相信你信仰的人。

基督教吸引并吸引人，而宗教人士却让这些人反感，你看得到的，他们非常、非常、非常排斥与他们意见不同的人。现在让我进一步说明这一点。首先，基督徒是被吸引的。注意这里说你们是盐。

“你是世上的盐。”那么什么是盐？在那个时代，盐的主要作用是防腐剂。你不会把盐放进水里，因为水不会变坏。

你会把盐放进肉里，因为肉会变质。它正在分崩离析，除非你加点盐。**这意味着，基督徒因为他们的信仰本质，在看到事情分崩离析时会挺身而出。**当你看到有人情绪崩溃时，你会像盐一样去安慰他们。

当你看到某个社区在社会或经济上陷入困境时，你会介入。基督徒被爱和怜悯的行动所吸引，就像盐的作用一样。然而，宗教人士则像是被公牛束缚住的人。这又是什么意思呢？

**这意味着他们真的很想团结在一起，不喜欢与那些意见不同的人混在一起。**他们不会被那些分崩离析的社区吸引，也不会被情绪崩溃的人吸引。他们会环顾四周，然后收紧自己的裙子。这就是宗教性和基督教之间的区别。

不仅如此，基督徒不仅会被不同意他们观点的人和过着完全不同生活的人所吸引，还会成为这些人吸引的对象。因为请注意，除了光的美好概念之外，盐还有另一面作用。盐的另一个任务不仅是防腐，还要让食物变得美味。例如，我不喜欢玉米粒上没有盐的味道。

但如果我吃了一颗真正好吃的玉米粒，我会放下它，然后会说什么？我会对蜂蜜说：“亲爱的，那真是太棒了。”还是说“那颗玉米粒真好吃”？因为盐的作用不是让你觉得盐有多好，而是让与之相关的事物显得更好。

我们进一步推动这个概念。如果你在小组圣经研读中是盐，那么如果你是**真正的盐，人们不会离开时说：“那个人真的懂《圣经》，全都知道答案，让我很没面子。” 没有，实际情况是**这样：当你离开一个曾经使你成为盐的小群体时，人们不会说那个人多么伟大，而是会说那个小组多么伟大。这其实很简单。

你看，盐让人感觉更好，换句话说，基督徒会让你感觉更好，而宗教人士总是让你感到自责，让你感觉自己更差。在第七章稍后的地方，有一个非常著名的段落。再次，你可以立刻看到耶稣用两种方式对比它。他说：“不要论断人，免得你们被论断。

” 他又说：“你们这假冒为善的人！先去掉自己眼中的梁木，然后才能看得清楚，去掉你弟兄眼中的刺。”这话是什么意思呢？有些人认为**这意味着你不应该进行道德评判，不应该试图说服别人你的宗教是对的。**

这就是在评判。当然，这不是真的。为什么？因为说“你不应进行道德评判”，本身就是一种道德评判；而说“你不应说服他人你的宗教观点是正确的”，本身就是在说服他们你的宗教观点是正确的，这就意味着你无法不进行道德评判。

你怎么可能不进行呢？一说不要做这件事，你就已经做了。为了否认它，你必须去做它。甚至说出“我不打算这样做”这句话时，你也已经在使用它了。

那么耶稣在说什么呢？评判就是进行道德评价，并带有优越感。让我再强调一下：基督徒总是把自身的罪看作是木头里的梁柱，而别人的罪看作是眼中的刺；宗教人士则总是把自己的罪看作是眼中的刺，而别人的所有罪都像是木头里的梁柱。这就是为什么宗教人士总是让你感觉更糟糕，让你感到自责，而基督教就像盐和光。

顺便说一句，在我们继续之前，我要补充一点：我不是在说基督教的信仰很流行。哦，天哪，不是这样。我说的是福音的善行是吸引人的，我指的是福音的善行，而不是指福音本身。福音仍然让很多人感到厌恶。

一开口谈论你的信仰，就会遇到麻烦。这里有个区别：如果你内心有福音的恩典，你绝不会对任何人感到优越，尤其是那些与你不同的人。顺便说一句，你对待纽约市的态度是判断你是基督徒还是宗教徒的最佳方式之一。因为当你看看纽约市时，你会看到两件事。

首先，你会看到一些东西正在分崩离析，而宗教人士会问：“谁还想要住在那里？”这表明他们完全没有影响力。换句话说，宗教人士环顾四周，会说：“这些人哪里有问题？”要知道，我的罪就像芝麻，你的罪像木头。

不仅如此，当你环视纽约市时，你会立刻看到他们在走开。你可以看看某些人并说：“这里有个不遵守十诫的人。”这其实并不难看出来。基督徒并不会因此而反感。

宗教人士则完全会反感。所以第一个要点是：福音的恩典更加耀眼，更具吸引力。你可能会问：为什么呢？让我们继续。

## 更深：内心而非外表 / Deeper: The Heart Not Just Externals

Because, secondly, gospel goodness is deeper.

And here we're not talking about the relationship with the world. We're talking about a relationship with your own heart. When Jesus Christ said in verse 20, I tell you that unless your righteousness or passes that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.

When he said that, he knew that everybody must have just been utterly incredibly amazed. Because the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were basically full-time, they did full-time obedience. That was their job.

They had divided, you know, they worked out the Bible into something like 635 laws. And they just, they had the checklist. They had positive laws and they had negative laws, things you had to do, things you were supposed to avoid.

And they just spent all day working on it. And when Jesus Christ says, you know, your righteousness has to surpass. Right away, people must have said, how could that be?

Oh, and the world could be more righteous than the scribes and the teachers of the law and the Pharisees. And actually the answer is kind of weird because you see, it's a little bit like saying, here's this river and it's a mile wide. And when Jesus says you have to surpass the river, it doesn't necessarily mean you've got to go that way.

Maybe he means you've got to go this way. Maybe the river is a mile wide, but it's only an inch deep. And therefore, as soon as he says verse 20, the next few verses immediately show Jesus is answering the questions that he knew would be right in people's minds.

What does he mean when he says you have to surpass? Well, in verse 21, 27, 31, 33, 43 in other words, over and over and over again. He says, you've heard that I say.

And he goes through the 10 commandments. You've heard, now shall not murder. You've heard that shall not commit adultery.

You've heard it said, now shall keep thy promises not lie. Keep your oath. He's gone to the 10 commandments.

So what is he doing? In every case he says, you're concerned, you religious people are concerned with the external, I'm concerned with the heart. You can have the external and the heartbeat just like everybody else in the world.

But if your heart is a different, is completely new, then you'll have the external too. Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer? Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith?

For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding of what it means to follow Christ. A great resource to start using this summer is the new city-catechism devotional, God's truth for our hearts and minds. This devotional brings the historic catechisms of the Christian Church to life, offering a question to consider for each week of the year.

In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catechesis, the rich and communal practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers that frame the foundational beliefs of the Christian faith. Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer, and a brief meditation that will challenge and inspire you. The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller, and Kevin D.

Young, as well as historical figures such as Augustine, John Calvin, and Martin Luther. This month, in addition to the new city-catechism devotional, we are including a great companion resource, the new city-catechism for kids, as our thank you for your gift, to help gospel and life share the hope of Christ's love with people all over the world. So request your copies today at gospelonlife.com-slashgive, that's gospelonlife.com-slashgive.

Now here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. Now here's what he does, let me show you, you know, it's just this sort of thing will make you sink in your pews. He says, okay, let's take a look at murder.

You've heard it said that I'll show a lot murder. Religious people are concerned about not physically murdering somebody, but I say unto you. He says, if in your heart you have ill will, if you despise them, if you think of people as fools, if you disdain them, if you're indifferent to them, you've killed them.

And then he was on a sex, says, you've heard it said I'll show a committed adultery. Now, you know, the Christian sex ethic is no sex outside marriage. Well, what is that all about?

Well, here's what it's about, which Jesus shows you when you have sex outside marriage, what you're doing is you're saying, I want to have physical, external, nakedness and vulnerability, but I don't want to give you personal nakedness and vulnerability. In other words, let's be naked physically, but I don't want to actually give myself to you in every other way. I don't want to get married to you.

I don't want to give up my independence. I don't want to give up my options. I don't want to really give my, in other words, I don't want to back up physical nakedness and vulnerability with actual personal, complete nakedness and vulnerability.

I don't want to do that. And Jesus Christ says, when you ask for physical nakedness and you don't have the integrity or the guts to back it up with personal, in other words, if you're not willing to put your whole heart there, it says that's lust. And when you do that, even in fantasy, you're stabbing yourself in the heart.

Then he goes on to truth. And he says, you've heard it said that if you've taken oath, you better stick with the oath. But he says, again, that's all external.

In other words, you've signed a contract. And if you break the contract, the lawyers will come after you. And this and that sort of thing.

He says, I say unto you, let your yes be yes and let your no be known. What does he mean? What he means is your heart should be so full of integrity that every single thing you say, every yes and every no should be taken as seriously by you as if you just swore on a stack of Bibles because external consequences should mean nothing.

In other words, he goes on and on and on all the way through when he talks about turning the other cheek. You know, or don't pay back. He says, you may not be paying back physically, but I say unto you, turn the other cheek, what does turn the other cheek?

We'll get to that later this spring, but basically what does turn the other cheek? Turn the other cheek means not just you refrain from paying back, but you're still hoping for a relationship. You're still hoping, you're hoping for that person.

You want him someday to kiss you. That's why you turn the other cheek. You don't turn the other cheek in order to get hit.

That's another sermon. But see, the whole point of turning other cheek is Jesus says, don't you dare just refrain from vengeance externally. I don't just ask for that.

I say to you, when you look at a person who's wronged you, no matter how messed up and no matter how vicious they've been, you need to treat them with hope. You need to treat them with forgiveness. If you're going to oppose them, you should never oppose them except in love and good will.

Now, by the time you get to the end of this whole section, you're kind of like a massive smoking wreckage. You're sitting here like this and you started to say, listen, Buddha, Confucius, Muhammad, any teacher of ethics, there's never been a teacher who's asked for this. Never.

Never a teacher who's wanted to go this deep. You see in a way, verse 20 is easy. He says, you have to surpass the scribes and the Pharisees and the Jews of the Law.

He says, you have to surpass the religious people. What he really means is, I want you to have your heart changed and religion only worries about the externals. And you have an awful lot of people who are doing the law, you know, they're not committing adultery and they're not killing and they're not paying back and they're telling the truth.

But they're doing it exactly the way the world does out of fear and out of pride. He's like, here's a religious person and they say, I tell the truth. And here's a worldly person and they're cheating everywhere and they're lying and they're doing all this stuff.

Oh, the religious person says, I don't lie. I'm not like them. Well, now why is that worldly person cheating and lying?

A, fear. One of the reasons you lie is you say, oh my goodness, I might lose my money, I might lose my reputation. Fear.

The other is pride. You say, I'm going to get them. I'm going to pull a number on them.

Fear and pride lead them to lie. Why does a religious person not lie? Why does a religious person tell the truth?

Why? Here's what Jesus says, fear and pride. Either you say, I'm not going to lie because God will get me, boy, better not lie.

He's going to get ahold of me. He's going to take me out. In the other possible way, religious people say, I'm not going to lie, why?

Because I'm not like those kinds of people that lie. I'm not a liar. I'm a good person.

So at a fear and at a pride, you don't lie. And over here, at a fear and at a pride, they do lie. And Jesus says, what's the difference?

See, one kind of goodness, a selfish goodness. Religious goodness is selfish goodness. It's trying to get leverage.

It's trying to say, if I lie, if I tell the truth, then God will have to be good to me. If I tell the truth, then I can feel superior to other people. This is the reason why religious goodness is so alienating and this is the reason it's so shallow.

Hmm. And that's the reason why that's the reason why gospel goodness is brighter because it's deeper. Okay.

Then why is it so deep? And here's the answer. Thirdly, because it's sweeter.

Gospel goodness has a center of sweetness. There's something that's happened in the center. The good news about the sermon on the Mount is this.

When you read through carefully, you will see that Jesus Christ does not say, try to live like this and then God will be your father. Oh, no. All the way through here, he says, you can live like this if you already know God's your father.

Look at verse 16. He says, why are you going to be able to let your light shine? Why are you going to have an attitude toward the world that's non-condescending?

Why are you going to love people to disagree with you? Why are you going to be light? Why are you going to be bright?

Because God's your father. Where let me go deeper into the sermon. He in, not out into my sermon, the sermon on the Mount, I'm already very deep into the sermon.

In chapter 6, this is a fascinating place where Jesus says, don't worry, have no anxiety about anything. And you say, what, what kind of command is that? How can I stop worrying?

How can I stop worrying? And if you treat this religiously, of course, you're going to say, I guess I've got to stop worrying. How do I do that?

What I got to. And Jesus says, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, he says, he says, have not an anxiety about these things. Don't you see God taking care of the birds?

Don't you see God taking care of the lilies of the field? Don't you know that your heavenly father, if he cares for them, don't you know how much more valuable you are than them? Now here's what Jesus is showing us.

The sermon on the Mount is impossible unless you know you're valuable. Jesus sums it. And the difference between religion and Christianity is this.

Religion obeys the law of God unto value, trying to get value. In chapter 6 it says the reason you give to the poor is so people will honor you. In chapter 6 it says the reason that you pray is to get God to listen to you for your many words.

See, a religious person is trying to get value, a religious person is saying, if I do all these good things, then God will have to listen to me and then people will honor me. You are trying to get value and that's the reason why you're alienating. That's the reason why deep inside you're filled with fear and pride.

But gospel is obeying God's law out of value, not unto, not seeking value, but because you know. That's amazing. In other words, unless there's a center of sweetness, unless there's this incredible inner sweetness, a knowledge that you are of incredible value to him, there's nothing he would do.

You know, he was nothing he would not do in order to hold on to you and keep you. He's a father, not a boss. If you're an employee and you're good, you've got a boss.

And if you're bad and you disobey the laws, you're fired. But if you're a child and you've got a father or a mother and you're good, you've got a father or mother and you're bad, you've got a grumpy father or mother but you've got a father or mother. In fact, oh, fathers and mothers, you know something, don't you?

And that is, this is something very weird that if you've got three children, my guy do, and one of those being disobedient, so often the disobedient one has your heart the most. Why? It's the nature of parenthood.

And when Jesus comes along and says, the secret of the difference between good gospel goodness and religious righteousness is that you have got as a father. That happens before you can obey. It's not something you obey in order to get.

It's something you obey because of. When you know God as your father, when you have that center of sweetness, changes everything. See, religious people, for example, never do anything unless it's about them.

Why do you help a little lady across the street? It's not about her, it's about you. Maybe God will answer your prayers and you'll feel like a pretty good person.

See? Why do you help the poor? It's not about the poor.

It's about you. It's the reason why very often the religious people's help over the poor is so condescending and so ineffective because it's filled with superiority. Why does a religious person pray?

It's about you. It's not for him. That's the reason why your prayers are filled with petition and very little adoration and repentance.

Therefore, you see, you're brighter. It's brighter because it's deeper, it's deeper because it's sweeter and it's sweeter why, finally, how do you become a child of God? How is it possible that you could know that he's your father?

See, somebody out here is saying, well, wait a minute, isn't God the father of everybody? God is the father of all people. And what Jesus is saying is, well, yes, in one sense, but not in a sense I'm talking about because he says knowing God as your father is the heart of what makes you a Christian rather than a religious person.

And not being sure about God's love and not being sure who you are and not being sure is the heart of religiosity. And using goodness, really, it's about you. It's not about the people around you or God.

It's leverage goodness. I do it to get leverage. It's manipulative goodness.

I do it in order to get people in God to do the things I want. That's the difference. And therefore, how am I going to get this inner sweetness and the answer is in verse 17.

It's which is the secret to the whole thing because gospel goodness has a higher view of the law of God than any other kind of goodness. You see, Jesus Christ, I'm sure when he gets to this verse, he says, I bet you all are thinking because I'm talking about God as if he's your father that you can be sure of his love and acceptance, no matter who you are, no matter what you are. I'm sure you think I have a low view of the law.

I have a higher view of the law than you do. He says, Christianity has a higher view of the law than religion. Why?

Well, there's two kinds of religion. I'll give you one kind. First of all, it's what I call liberal religion and liberal religion says, basically, God loves everybody and you just try your best.

Is that going to give you that inner sense of sweetness? Is that going to make you absolutely and totally sure that God loves you utterly? Is that going to give you, are you going to be amazed at what God's done in order to love you?

No. Sentimental. That's liberal religion.

On the other hand, you've got conservative religion and conservative religion says, here's the rules. Do it. Conservative religion knows your center, doesn't really know your love and liberal religion knows your love, but it doesn't cost God anything to love you.

But Jesus Christ comes along and says, I do not come to abolish the law, that's against liberal religion. I come to fulfill it. And that's against conservative religion.

Why? What Jesus Christ, what does he mean when he says, I come to fulfill it? Well, look at this sermon on the Mount.

First of all, he's the only one who ever lived this sermon on the Mount. Go through this sermon on the Mount and you're amazed at the beauty of the character. Well, it's Jesus.

Jesus is the only person who ever lived like this. But not only that, he didn't just fulfill most of the sermon on the Mount, he's fulfilled to be attitudes. And here's how he fulfilled them.

Jesus said, Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy, but Jesus Christ, though he was merciful, did not obtain mercy, he was condemned. Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God. And Jesus Christ, who was pure in heart, did not see God, but rather had his God turn his face away from him on this cross.

That's why he cried out, my God, my God, why has that turn my face away? Jesus says the meek on here at the earth, well, he was perfectly meek, absolutely meek, but he was disenfranchised. Blessed are those who hunger in thirst after righteousness, well, nobody hunger in thirst after righteousness, like Jesus Christ, except he wasn't fulfilled.

He was emptied out. He said, I thirst. Why?

Here's why. He, though he was meek, lost his inheritance, so you, though you're not meek, can get it. He, though, was pure in heart, didn't see God, so you and I, who are not pure in heart, can.

He, though he was merciful, obtained no mercy, so you and I, who are not merciful, can. Jesus Christ says, I have fulfilled the sermon on the Mount. I have utterly fulfilled it, and therefore when you believe in me, not only does everything that you deserve come on to me, but everything I've done comes on to you, which means that when God looks at you, Christian friends, brother, sister, he sees someone as beautiful as someone who's doing the sermon on the Mount every day, absolutely every day.

That is high. That's a higher view of the law. Jesus Christ says, I take the law more seriously than any religious person, because there are other religious people said, do your best and I say, no, you've got to be perfect, absolutely perfect.

I've been perfect for you, and that's the reason why you got that great hymn that I've done. By John Newton, I'll say it twice as some of you've heard it 10 times before, where John Newton says, to see the law by Christ fulfilled, and hear his pardoning voice, transforms a slave into a child, and duty into choice. To see the law by Christ fulfilled, and here is pardoning voice, transforms a slave into a child, and duty into choice.

Now, practical two or three things that were done. First of all, what does this mean? Have you seen all over New York, you go by the phone booth and the bus station stops and you have all the ads, and this ad is a beautiful model in undergarments.

And it says, inner beauty only goes so far. Now, I'm going to say something just to get your attention so you can write it down so I heard a press term minister say this. That's a damn lie.

Damned. D-A-M-N-E-D. It is.

Absolutely. It's making fun of the values of the kingdom of God. You're never going to have the upside down kingdom, where instead of looking for power and looking for success and looking for approval, you live a life of sacrifice, unless you have the inside out kingdom, which says what really matters is what really matters is who I am to Jesus and who I'm in my heart, and not whether I look right, and not what, in other words, the wealth I need, the worth I need, see, the reputation I need is all wrapped up in him.

And that makes Christians radically free, we're not self-conscious, we're not scared about our bank account. You're never going to live the upside down kingdom unless you have the inside out kingdom. Secondly, and this is fairly important, verse 19 says, a Christian, one of the ways you know you're a Christian is that you love to study the law of God and obey it.

If you're a religious person, you're kind of scared of the word of God. And of course, if you're a relativistic person, you don't, you disdain the law of God. But the one of the ways you know that you're a believer and you've got gospel goodness is as Psalm 1 says, the blessed is the Godly man, his delight is in the law of God, and on it he meditates, day and night.

In other words, one of the ways you can tell, you've got gospel goodness, is you're love to have God tell you what to do. You're delight in meditating and finding things where you can change. That's one of the best ways to know whether you really understand the gospel of grace.

Because if you read the Bible and you read the sermon amount and you just feel terrible, you say, oh my goodness, how the God ever loved me, you still don't get it. You still don't understand what Jesus means when He says, I came to fulfill it. You don't get it yet.

You're still stuck in a certain amount of religiosity. If you don't just love to have Him tell you what to do and tell you where you're wrong. If it doesn't give you delight instead just crushes you down, you still don't get it.

It's a test. Lastly, if you're not sure whether you're a Christian or not, let me suggest something. The sermon on the mount is not a horizontal bar.

It's not a way to climb up to God. Do this and do this. No, it's a vertical bar.

It says there's two ways. One way is to say out of my goodness, I will seek to get God and other people to give me what I need in inner emptiness. That is a feeling of approval, a feeling of worth, or you can say, I'm going to build my whole life and my approach to God on what Jesus has done for me, but your own Savior or let Him be your Savior.

See, there's a vertical line. The sermon on the mount is not, here's a horizontal line, climb on up, no, choose to see the law by Christ fulfilled and here is pardoning voice, transform the slave into a child. Let's pray.

Father, we thank you that you have shown us the difference in Christianity and religion. Now, we all need to see this, whether we're Christians, whether we're not Christians or whether we're not sure what we are, if we're not sure what we are, if we're not sure what we are, we need to know, understand this, and there's people in this room now that are seeking to find out how to connect with you. I pray that they would learn what this means.

I have come to fulfill the law of God. Father, some of us in this room who know that a lot of our goodness is religious, even though we're Christians, and it's one of the reasons why we're just not reveling in and rejoicing, rejoicing in Jesus' fulfillment of the law for us. And as a result of that, we really don't delight in the law of God, and our prayer life is filled with deadness, and we pray that you would help us to rejoice in the gospel tonight in such a way that this week we are, we're conformed more into the likeness of your Son and therefore, we live brighter, deeper, sweeter lives.

Now, we pray all this in Jesus' name, amen. Thanks for listening to Tim Keller on the Gospel Unlife Podcast. If you'd like to see more people encouraged by the Gospel Center teaching and resources of this ministry, we invite you to consider becoming a Gospel Unlife monthly partner.

因为第二个要点是：福音的恩典更深刻。这里我们不是在谈论与世界的关係，而是指内心的关係。当耶稣在第20节说：“我告诉你们，不到你们的义胜过文士和法利赛人的义，你们断不得进天国。”这句话时，他肯定知道所有人都会感到震惊不已。

因为法利赛人和教师们几乎都是全职遵守律法的人，那是他们的工作。他们已经把圣经细分为大约635条法律，并且有清单可查。他们既有正面的律法也有负面的律法，即必须做的事情和应该避免的事情。他们整整一天都在做这件事。

而当耶稣基督说，你们的义必须胜过文士和法利赛人的义时，人们立刻会想：怎么可能呢？哦，世界可能比文士、法利赛人和律法师还要义正言辞。实际上答案有点奇怪，因为你看，这就像有一条河，宽一英里。当耶稣说你们必须胜过这条河时，并不意味着你一定要走那条路。

也许他指的是另一条路。或许这条河虽然宽一英里，但只有几英寸深。因此，当他说到第20节时，接下来的几节经文立刻表明耶稣正在回答那些人们心中会问的问题。他到底是什么意思说你们必须胜过呢？

在第21、27、31、33和43节中，换句话说，一遍又一遍地重复，他说：“你们听见了……”然后他列举了十诫。你们听见了，不可杀人；你们听见了，不可奸淫。你们听见了，现在是说要守约不欺骗，守你的誓言。他已经提到了十诫。

那么他在做什么呢？在每一个例子中，他说：你们这些宗教人士关心的是外在的，而我关心的是内心。你可以有和世界其他人一样的外表，但如果你的心不同，完全不一样，你也会有内心的改变。这个夏天，你在寻找成长信仰的方法吗？

还是希望帮助新信徒或孩子理解基督教的核心？对于许多人来说，夏季可以提供更多的机会来深化我们的信仰和对跟随基督的理解。今年夏天开始使用的一个很好的资源是新的城市 catechism 日课，《上帝的心智与真理》。这本日课将基督教教会的历史 catechisms 带入生活，为一年中的每一周提供一个问题供我们思考。

在引言部分，Tim Keller 为教义问答（catechesis）这一丰富且共同体化的学习和记忆实践奠定了基础。这种做法通过问题与答案的形式来阐明基督教信仰的基本信念。每周的内容包括一段圣经经文、一篇祷告和简短的默想，这些内容将挑战并激励你。附带的注释由当代牧师如约翰·派博、Tim Keller 和凯文·D 所撰写，也有年轻的历史人物如奥古斯丁、约翰·加尔文和马丁·路德。

无论是年轻人还是历史人物的作品，都包括在内。本月，除了新的城市教义灵修手册外，我们还将提供一个很棒的配套资源——为孩子们准备的新城市教义问答，作为对您礼物的感谢，帮助福音与生活向全世界的人们分享基督之爱的信息。所以请访问 gospelonlife.com-give（gospelonlife.com-slashgive）订购您的副本。现在让我们听听 Tim Keller 的余下讲道。

他这样做了，让我来展示给你看，这种做法会让你在座位上坐立不安。他说：“好，我们现在来看看谋杀。” 你可能听说过不要杀人，但宗教人士通常只关注不实际杀害他人。然而，耶稣说：“我告诉你们。

” 他说：“如果你心中怀有恶意，如果轻视他们，如果认为他们是愚人，如果鄙视他们，或者对他们漠不关心，那你就已经杀了他们了。” 然后他继续说到性的问题，说：“你可能听说过不要通奸。现在你知道，基督教的性伦理是婚姻之外没有性行为。” 那么这又是怎么回事呢？

耶稣在这里告诉你，当你在婚姻之外进行性行为时，你实际上是在说：我想有肉体上的亲密和裸露，但我不想给你个人层面的真诚与敞开心扉。换句话说，我们可以身体上赤裸相见，但我并不想以其他任何方式真正地把自己交给你，也不想娶你。我不想放弃我的独立。我不想放弃我的选择。

换句话说，我不愿意真正地暴露自己的身体和脆弱性，并以此换取实际的、完全的身体和心灵上的赤裸与脆弱。我不愿意这样做。而耶稣基督说，当你要求身体上的赤裸，却不具备相应的个人诚信或勇气去承担这种赤裸时，这被称为淫念。即使是在幻想中这么做，你也在伤害自己的心。

然后他转向真理。他说：“你们听人说过，发誓后就要遵守誓言。”但他又说，这只是外表的行为。换句话说，就像签了合同一样。

如果你违背了合同，律师会来找你的。诸如此类的事情。他说：“我告诉你们，要让你们的‘是’就是‘是’，‘不是’就是‘不是’。”他是什么意思呢？

他的意思是，你的心应该充满诚信，以至于你所说的每一个“是”和“不是”，都应该像在圣经上发誓一样认真对待。外部的后果不应成为问题。换句话说，在谈到转过身去的时候，他说了很多很多。你知道，或者不要报复。

他说：“你可能不会用身体来报复，但我告诉你们，要转过身去。”那么，“转过身去”是什么意思？我们会在今年春天继续讨论这个问题，但基本上“转过身去”的意思是：你不只是不进行报复，你还希望能与那个人建立关系。你希望他有一天能亲吻你。

这就是为什么你要转过身去。你不是为了被击打才转过身去。这是另一篇讲道的内容。但是你看，整个“转过身去”的要点是耶稣说：“不要仅仅在外表上避免复仇。

”我不仅仅要求这一点。我对你们说，当你们面对伤害过你的人时，无论他们多么糟糕、多么残忍，你们都需要带着希望去对待他们。需要以宽恕之心去对待他们。如果要反对他们，也必须在爱和善意中进行。

到这一段结束的时候，你们就像是巨大的燃烧残骸。你们坐在这里，开始说：听我说，佛陀、孔子、穆罕默德以及其他任何道德教师，从来没有人要求过这样的事情。从来没有一个老师想要达到这种深度。他所说的第20节其实很简单。

他说：“你们要胜过律法师和法利赛人以及犹太人。” 他说的是超越那些宗教人士。实际上他的意思是希望你们的心灵得到改变，而宗教只关注外在的行为。有很多人在遵守法律，他们没有通奸、杀人、报复，并且说真话。

但他们都是出于恐惧和骄傲去做这些事的。他像是在说：这里有一个宗教人士，他说：“我讲真话。”而这个世界上的其他人到处都在欺骗、撒谎，做着各种各样的坏事。宗教人士会说：“我不撒谎，我不是他们那样的人。

”那么，为什么那个世俗的人会撒谎和欺骗呢？A. 恐惧。你撒谎的一个原因是：天哪，我可能会失去金钱，可能会失去名誉。B. 骄傲。

你会想：“我要让他们吃不了兜着走。” 恐惧和骄傲导致了他们说谎。那么，为什么宗教人士不会撒谎？为什么他们会讲真话呢？

耶稣说的就是这两个原因：恐惧和骄傲。要么是出于对神的敬畏，你不想被神抓住，所以不敢撒谎；要么是因为你认为自己不是那种会撒谎的人，你是好人。> 你们要胜过律法师和法利赛人以及犹太人。> 他所说的超越宗教人士，实际上希望你们的心灵得到改变。

而宗教只关注外在的行为。很多人遵守法律，他们没有通奸、杀人、报复，并且说真话。但他们都是出于恐惧和骄傲去做这些事的。所以，在恐惧和骄傲面前，你不撒谎；而在这里，在恐惧和骄傲面前，他们却撒谎。

耶稣说：“这有什么区别呢？” 你看，一种自私的善良，宗教的善良就是自私的善良。它试图获得优势。它在想：如果我说谎，或者说实话，上帝就必须对我好。

如果我说实话，就可以觉得自己比别人优越。这就是为什么宗教的善良如此令人疏远，也如此浅薄。嗯。因此，福音的善良之所以更加明亮，是因为它更深刻。

好的。那么，它为什么会这么深呢？答案在这里：第三点，因为它更甜美。福音的善良有一个甜蜜的核心。

中心发生了某种变化。登山宝训的好消息就是这个。当你仔细阅读时，你会发现耶稣基督并没有说：“试着这样生活，然后上帝就会成为你的父亲。”不，整篇经文都在说，如果你已经知道上帝是你的父亲，你就可以这样生活。

看看第十六节。他说：“为什么你能让自己的光发光？为什么你会对世界有非贬抑的态度？” 为什么你会爱那些不同意你的人？

为什么你会发光、发亮？因为上帝是你的父亲。让我更深入地探讨这个讲道。不是深入我的讲道，而是登山宝训，我已经很深入了。

在第六章这里，耶稣说：“不要忧虑，对任何事都不要焦虑。”你说，这是一条什么样的命令呢？我怎么才能停止担忧？你怎么能停止担忧呢？

如果你从宗教的角度来理解，当然你会说：好吧，我大概得停止担忧。那我该怎么做呢？耶稣却说：“不，不，不，不，不，不，等等，”他说，“不要为这些事忧虑。”你看，上帝不是正在照顾鸟儿吗？

不要看神怎样照顾田间的百合花吗？难道你们不知道，如果天上的父神都顾念他们，岂不更顾念你们这些比百合花更加宝贵的人吗？现在耶稣要向我们展示的是： 登山宝训是不可能的，除非你知道自己是宝贵的。耶稣总结了这一点。

宗教和基督教之间的区别在于此。宗教遵行上帝的律法以求价值，试图获得价值。在第六章中说，你施舍给穷人是为了让人荣耀你。在第六章中还说，你祷告是因为你想让神听你的许多话。

你看，一个宗教的人是在寻求价值，一个宗教的人会说：“如果我做了所有的好事，那么神就必须听我的，人们也会荣耀我。”你们是在寻求价值，这就是为什么你们会被排斥的原因。这也是为什么你们内心深处充满了恐惧和骄傲。但福音是出于价值遵行上帝的律法，不是为了获得价值，而是因为你明白这一点。

这真是太神奇了。换句话说，除非你心中有这种甜蜜的感觉，除非你知道自己在他眼中是多么宝贵，否则他不会为你做任何事。你知道吗？为了留住你、保佑你，他会不惜一切。

他是你的父亲，而不是老板。如果你是员工而表现良好，你有一个老板；如果你违反规定被解雇了，你就没有工作了。但如果你是孩子，有爸爸或妈妈，即使你不好也不听话，你仍然有一个爱你的爸爸或妈妈。事实上，各位亲爱的爸爸妈妈们，你们知道吗？

这就是非常奇怪的一件事：如果有三个孩子，其中一个不听话，往往那个不听话的孩子最让你牵挂。为什么呢？这是做父母的天性。当耶稣说：“好福音的美德和宗教的义之间的秘密在于你有一个父亲。

”这发生在你能遵行律法之前，不是因为你去遵行它来获得什么。它是因为某种东西而顺服的。当你知道神是你的父亲，当你有了那种甜蜜的核心时，一切都变了。你看，比如说宗教人士，他们从不做事只是为了别人。

你为什么帮助一位老太太过马路？并不是因为她，而是因为你。也许神会回答你的祷告，让你觉得自己是个不错的人。你看？

你为什么帮助穷人？并不是为了穷人。而是为了你自己。这就是为什么宗教人士对穷人的帮助往往如此居高临下、无效的原因——因为充满了优越感。

宗教人士为什么祈祷？也是为了自己。不是为了神。这也是为什么你们的祷告充满了祈求，而很少有敬拜和悔改。

因此你看，你更亮了。因为它更深，因为它更甜蜜，而它之所以更甜蜜，最终，你怎么才能成为神的孩子？你怎么能知道他是你的父亲呢？有人在这里说，等等，难道不是神是所有人的父亲吗？

神是所有人的父亲。耶稣的意思是，是的，在某种意义上是这样，但不是我所说的那种意义，因为他所说的作为基督徒而不是宗教人士的关键在于知道神是你的父亲。不确定神的爱、不确定自己是谁，这是宗教性的核心。利用善良，实际上是关于你自己。

并不是为了周围的人或神。而是为了获得杠杆作用的善良。我是为了得到别人的帮助而做善事。这就是区别所在。

因此，我如何才能获得这种内在的甜蜜呢？答案在第17节中。这是其中的关键，因为福音的善良比其他任何一种善良都更尊重上帝的律法。你看，耶稣基督，在他读到这一节经文时，我敢肯定他在想，你们一定在想，因为我提到上帝是你们的父亲，所以你们可以确信他的爱和接纳，无论你是谁，无论你是什么。

我肯定你们认为我对律法的看法很低。其实我的看法比你们更高。他说，基督教对律法的看法高于宗教。为什么呢？

有两种类型的宗教。我会给你一种。首先，这就是所谓的自由派宗教，自由派宗教说，基本上上帝爱所有人，你只需尽力而为。这能给你那种内心的甜蜜感吗？

这能使你绝对和完全确信上帝爱你吗？这能使你惊讶于上帝为了爱你所做的一切吗？不能。这是情感化的，这就是自由派宗教。

另一方面，你还有保守的宗教，保守的宗教说，这里有规则，做到就行。保守的宗教知道你的中心，但不了解你的爱；而自由派宗教了解你的爱，但它不需要任何代价就能爱你。但是耶稣基督来了，他说，我来不是要废掉律法，这是针对自由派宗教而言的。我是来成全它的。

这也是对保守宗教的一种反驳。为什么？当耶稣说他来成全律法时，他到底是什么意思呢？看看登山宝训吧。

首先，他是唯一一个真正践行登山宝训的人。通读登山宝训，你会惊讶于其中人物的美好品格。没错，就是耶稣。耶稣是唯一一个这样生活的人。

但不仅如此，他不仅践行了登山宝训的大部分内容，他还践行了态度。而他是如何践行这些态度的呢？耶稣说：“怜悯人的，有福了；因为他们必蒙怜悯。”但耶稣基督虽然怜悯人，却没有得到怜悯，反而被定罪。

又说：“清洁的心，有福了；因为他们必看见神。”而耶稣基督，心地纯洁，却没有看见神，而是见到了他的神在十字架上转脸离开他。这就是为什么他会喊叫：“我的神，我的神，你为什么离弃我？”耶稣说，在地上谦卑的人，他是完全的谦卑，绝对的谦卑，但他却被剥夺了权利。

又说：“饥渴慕义的人有福了；”但除了耶稣基督，没有人像他那样饥渴慕义。他被清空了。他说：“我渴。”为什么？

因为他虽然谦卑，却失去了产业，所以你们虽不谦卑，也可以得到。他又虽然心地纯洁，却没有看见神，所以你们和我，如果不心地纯洁，也可以。他又虽然怜悯人，却没有得到怜悯，所以你们和我，如果不怜悯人，也可以。耶稣基督说：“我已经成全了律法上的教导。

”我已经完全成全了，因此当你信靠我的时候，不只是你所应得的都归在我身上，而且我所做的也都归在你身上，**这意味着当神看你们的时候，亲爱的基督徒朋友们，弟兄姐妹们，他看到的是一个每天像耶稣基督那样行律法的人。**这是很高的标准。这是一种更高的对律法的看法。耶稣基督说：“我比任何宗教的人都更认真对待律法。

”因为其他宗教人士曾说过“尽力而为”，而我说，“不，你们必须完全，绝对的完美。” 我已经为你做到了完美，这就是为什么你有那首伟大的赞美诗《从奴隶到儿子》的原因。约翰·牛顿写的这首诗我会重复两次，有些你们可能已经听过十次了： 通过基督成全律法， 听见他宽恕的声音， 使奴仆变成儿女， 义务变成选择。通过基督成全律法， 听见他宽恕的声音， 使奴仆变成儿女， 义务变成选择。

现在，让我们来看几个实际的例子。首先，这到底意味着什么？你有没有注意到，在纽约的每一个电话亭和公交车站牌上，都有各种广告，其中一个模特在展示内衣。广告上写着：“内在美只能走这么远。

”接下来我要说一些能引起你们注意的话，好让你们记下来。我听说一个牧师用过这个说法：那是一个彻头彻尾的谎言。“彻头彻尾”是 D-A-M-N-E-D 的意思，确实如此。绝对正确。

这在取笑上帝国的价值观。你永远无法拥有一个倒过来的国度，在那里，人们不是追求权力、成功和认可，而是过一种奉献的生活，除非你有从内到外的国度，这个国度说，真正重要的事情是你是谁，你在内心中是谁，而不是你的外表如何，也不是你需要多少财富、价值或声誉。所有这些都需要靠他。这使基督徒变得极其自由，我们不再自我意识强，也不再担心我们的银行账户。

除非你拥有从内到外的国度，否则你永远无法过上倒过来的生活。其次，这一点非常重要，提摩太前书19节说：“一个基督徒的一个标志就是热爱研究上帝的律法并遵守它。” 如果你是一个宗教人士，你可能会害怕上帝的话语；当然，如果你是一个相对主义者，你会轻视上帝的律法。但一个真正有福音恩典的人可以通过诗篇1章来辨别：那得福的是敬畏耶和华的人，他喜悦遵行他的道，在他道中昼夜思想。

换句话说，你可以通过以下方式判断你是否拥有福音恩典：你喜欢听从上帝的话，并在其中思考和寻求改变。这是了解你是否真正理解了恩典福音的一个很好的方法。因为如果你读圣经，读了讲道的内容之后，只觉得非常糟糕，说：“天哪，神怎么会爱我呢？”你还是没懂。

你还不明白耶稣所说的“成全”是什么意思。你还未领悟。你仍然陷在某种宗教的形式里。如果你只是喜欢听祂告诉你该做什么，哪里做得不对。

如果它没有给你带来喜悦，反而让你感到沮丧，那你还没有领悟。这是一次考验。最后，如果你不确定自己是不是基督徒，我建议你思考一下。登山宝训不是一条水平线。

它不是一条通往神的道路：做到这一点和那一点。不，它是竖直的标杆。它说有两种道路。一种是出于自己的善良，试图让神和其他人满足你的内在空虚——这种空虚带来的是被认可的感觉、价值感；另一种则是建立在耶稣为你所做的一切基础上，将祂视为你的救主或让你成为祂的救主。

你看，这里有条竖直线。登山宝训不是一条水平线，说“爬上来吧”，不，它是要你看到基督成全了律法，并且带来赦罪的声音，把奴隶变成儿女。我们来祷告。父啊，感谢祢让我们明白基督教与宗教的区别。

现在我们都需要看清这一点，无论我们是基督徒、非基督徒还是不确定自己是什么身份，如果不确定自己的身份，**我们需要知道并理解这个道理。**现在房间里有寻求如何与祢相交的人，愿他们能明白这意义所在。我已经来完成神的律法了。父亲，我们中有许多人知道，尽管我们是基督徒，但我们的很多善行其实是宗教性的，这也是我们没有真正喜乐、在耶稣为我们成就律法中找到喜乐的原因之一。

因此，我们的祷告生活充满了死气沉沉，我们祈求你能帮助我们在今晚的福音中找到喜乐，这样这一周我们会更像你的儿子，从而过上更加光明、深刻和甜美的人生。现在，我们奉耶稣的名祷告，阿门。感谢你收听了Tim Keller在《福音未生》播客上的讲道。如果你希望更多人通过这个事工的福音中心教导和资源得到鼓励，请考虑成为《福音未生》的月度合作伙伴。
