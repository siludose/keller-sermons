## 病症：对荣耀的空虚渴望 / The Sickness: Glory-Hunger

This is a great passage on humility that you just had read. When we have talked in the last few months about justice and the poor, I've always sensed that even though it's important, it's what the Bible says, we have the cultural window or back. You know what I mean?

The culture says, great, we're really glad that you Christians are thinking about that. We're interested in that too. So you have your window to the back.

But when you get to this subject, and this subject is humility, when you get to what the Bible says about humility, we have the cultural window in our face. Contemporary people, especially contemporary New Yorkers stare at the biblical concept of humility the way a cow stares at a new gate. Recently a commentator on the trends in the culture said this, said humility has come under attack in our society over the last few decades.

Self-effacement has become identified with conformity and self-repression. A different ethos came to the fore, which sociologists have called expressive individualism. Instead of being humble before God in history, now in our society, salvation is found through intimate contact with oneself and by exposing the beauty, the power, and even the divinity within.

So that's the approach of our culture and that completely flies in the face of what this text and what the Bible says about the importance of humility. Let's notice three things, this magnificent passage, we could easily do 30 weeks of sermons on just this passage, but we won't. Instead I'll give you a top level look at this, this is going to tell us about a sickness that we have, about what we would look like if we were healthy and how to get the cure.

Sickness, a picture of health, and the cure. Now the sickness is, find it in verse two and three. Be like-minded he says, have the same love, be one in spirit and purpose.

Now he's describing a unified human community, this is what we all want. We all want to live in a human community that's, there's no fighting and divisions, but there's love and there's oneness of spirit, oneness of mind, and okay, instead we have bombs in time square and political polarization and war, and you say but this is actually talking about the church, right that's the point, the point is there's something wrong with the human heart, so wrong that even inside a body like the church where everybody shares the same faith, there's constant fighting. The reason Paul's bringing this up is you will know if you read just read on to the end of this short letter, is there's contentions going on between a couple of key figures in the church.

Churches are filled with fighting and divisions, just like the rest of the world, why? Because there's something wrong with the heart. What is that?

Well, he mentions it. He says, if you're going to have oneness, therefore do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Now, the selfish ambition isn't a particularly illuminating phrase, it really just means the spirit of divisiveness, which is kind of what we know is the problem, but the second phrase is crucial.

The reason why we do things out of selfish ambition, or the reason why we have this division while we're always fighting is because of what he calls, what this translation calls vain conceit, but it's a single Greek word, quinoidoxias, quino means to empty, canosis, to empty oneself, and doxa means glory and honor, respect. What does it mean to be characterized by quinoidoxia? It means to be glory empty, to be hungry for honor, hungry for respect, hungry for that kind of assurance, because you don't feel like you are a person of importance.

This is radical, cosmic insecurity. This is feeling I don't count, I don't matter, I'm a femoral, I'm a wave upon the sand. I need assurance that I'm okay, that I'm important, that I count, you know, hungry for respect and for glory and for honor.

This is the human soul. It's much better. It's much better to be hated and attacked and to be ignored.

Remember at the end of the movie or the play, Amadeus, why is the aging saliary in a kind of living hell? Because as this composer gets old, he's not disliked, he's been forgotten. And because he's been forgotten, that's hell.

To be absolutely and finally dismissed and ignored. Now you see why being glory empty, feeling like I'm not important, I don't count, leads to the division. I mean, you can see it in a street gang.

What are street gangs? They're filled with generally young men that do not feel in any way valued by their society and very often not valued or loved by their families, and as a result, they walk down the street and if you slight them, slightly, they'll pull a gun on you. Because they're glory empty.

Because they don't feel important, they fight. And you say, well, of course, that's easy to see because, you know, yeah, that's them. They have low self-esteem, et cetera.

Yeah, I know, except if you read history, if you just read history, you'll know that nation states have always acted the same way as street gangs, you know, slight them slightly and they go to war. Because it's what we are corporately, it's what we are corporately. Why?

Why are we this way? Well, think of what the Bible says, I don't know of a better diagnosis. The Bible says we were made originally to live forever.

But because we've turned away from God, now we're fading. We know. We were made to never be forgotten.

We were made to stand in the presence of God and get His favor. We were made to last. But because we've turned away from God, we know we're dying.

We know we're fading. We know we're going to be forgotten. We don't feel real.

We feel like a wave upon the sand. We feel like a moon beam in the hand and all that. And so we desperately look to everybody we possibly can to get them to say you're good, you're important, you're worthwhile, you know, you'll never be forgotten.

You're so significant and we just desperate and that's all we fight. Lewis Meads, the Christian writer says this about pride because what we're talking about, this hunger for glory is pride. And he says pride is in the spiritual sense, is refusal to let God be God.

It's to grab God's status for oneself. It's wishing to be the creator, independent, reliant on one's own resources. And that is the greatest delusion, the delusional fantasy of all fantasies, the cosmic put on, the fantasy that we can make it as our own God's, which is what where everybody is, leaves us empty at the center, you hear that?

Leaves us empty at the center and therefore we learn to swagger. We're attacked by demons of fear and anxiety, so we bluff. We look around and whenever we see a new person, we use people as buttresses for the shaky ego that pride created every time you meet a new person, you are unconsciously wondering, how can this person contribute to my need to prove that I count?

Life therefore becomes a constant battle to use people to bolster your own self.

你们刚才读到的是一个关于谦卑的伟大段落。我们在过去几个月里讨论正义和穷人的时候，一直感觉到即使这些很重要，是圣经所说的，我们仍然有文化上的窗口或后视镜。

你知道我的意思吗？文化说，很好，很高兴看到基督徒们在思考这些问题。我们也对此感兴趣。所以你们有一个向后的窗口。

但当你谈到这个主题——谦卑，当你读到圣经关于谦卑的教导时，你会看到文化背景就在你面前。当代人，尤其是现代纽约人看待圣经中的谦卑观念就像牛看新围栏一样茫然。最近有位文化评论家这样说道：在过去的几十年里，谦卑在我们的社会中受到了攻击。自我贬抑被视作顺从和自我压抑的表现。

另一种伦理观逐渐兴起，社会学家称之为表达性个体主义。现在，在我们这个社会中，人们寻求救赎的方式不再是谦卑地站在上帝面前，而是通过与自己亲密接触来发现内在的美丽、力量甚至神性。这就是当今文化的态度，这完全违背了圣经对谦卑重要性的教导。让我们注意三点：这一段精彩的经文，我们可以就此展开30周的布道，但今天不会这样做。

我将给你一个高层次的概览，这会告诉我们一种病症，什么是健康的状态以及如何获得治愈。一、病症，在第二和第三节中找到。他说要心意相同，有同样的爱心，有一样的精神和目的。他描述的是一个统一的人类社群，这是我们所渴望的。

我们都希望生活在没有争斗和分裂，只有爱与心灵合一的社会里。但现实却是时代广场发生了爆炸事件，政治极化加剧，战争不断。你说这实际上是在谈论教会，对，正是这一点：人的内心出了问题，严重到即使在一个像教会这样的团体中，所有人都共享相同的信仰，仍然存在不断的争斗。保罗提到这一点的原因是，在你继续阅读这封简短的信件时，你会发现教会中有几位关键人物之间存在着争议。

教会里充满了争斗和分裂，就像这个世界一样，为什么呢？因为内心出了问题。是什么问题？他提到了这一点。

他说，如果你要追求合一，因此不要出于自私的野心或虚浮的骄傲。所谓自私的野心并不是一个特别有启发性的词，它实际上指的是分裂的精神，而这正是我们所知道的问题所在。但第二个词至关重要。我们之所以会出于自私的野心做事，或者我们在不断争斗中产生分裂的原因，是因为他所说的“虚浮的骄傲”，这个词在希腊语里是quinoidoxias，其中quino意味着空虚，canosis意味着自我空虚，doxa则意味着荣耀和尊荣。

什么是quinoidoxia？它意味着对荣耀的空虚，渴望荣誉、尊重，因为你觉得你不是一个重要的人。这是根本性的宇宙性不安全感。这是一种感觉：我不被重视，我无关紧要，我只是海浪中的泡沫。

你需要一种保证，让自己觉得一切安好，自己很重要，自己有价值。这就是人类的灵魂。与其被憎恨和攻击，不如被忽视。记得在电影《阿玛迪斯》的结尾，为什么那位老迈的萨利埃里处于地狱般的境地？

因为随着这位作曲家年老，他不仅不受喜爱，反而被人遗忘。因为他被遗忘，这才是真正的地狱。被绝对且彻底地忽略和排斥。现在你就能理解，对荣耀的空虚感、觉得自己不重要、无关紧要，会带来分裂的原因了。

比如，你能看到街头帮派的情况。什么是街头帮派？它们通常由一些感觉自己在社会中毫无价值的年轻人组成，很多时候他们甚至得不到家庭的关爱。因此，他们在街上行走时，如果你哪怕稍微侮辱他们一下，他们就会拔枪对你。

因为他们对荣耀感到空虚。因为觉得自己不重要，所以才去争斗。你可能会说，这很容易看出来，因为他们就是这样的。他们自尊心低。

是的，我知道，但如果你读历史，你会发现国家就像街上的帮派一样，稍微羞辱一下他们，他们就会开战。因为我们作为一个整体就是这样，为什么呢？我们为什么会这样？想想圣经怎么说吧，我找不到比这更好的诊断了。

圣经说，我们原本是为了永远活着而被创造出来的。但是因为背离了上帝，我们现在正在消逝。我们知道。我们原本是为了永远不被遗忘而被创造的。

我们原本是为了站在上帝面前获得祂的恩宠而被造的。我们原本是为了永恒而被造的。但因为我们背离了上帝，所以我们知道我们在消逝，在被遗忘，我们觉得自己不真实。我们感觉自己就像沙滩上的波浪，就像手心里的一道月光。

所以我们会拼命地去寻找每一个人来证明自己是好的、重要的、有价值的，永远不会被遗忘。你如此重要，但我们总是感到绝望和焦虑，因此拼命地想要得到别人的认可。基督教作家刘易斯·米德关于骄傲说过这样的话，因为我们谈论的正是这种对荣耀的渴望，这就是骄傲。他指出，在灵性上，骄傲就是拒绝让上帝做上帝，而是要抢夺上帝的地位给自己。

希望成为创造者，独立自主，依靠自己的资源。这是所有幻想中最荒谬的幻想，是宇宙级的骗局，是我们试图自己创造上帝的幻觉，这让我们内心空虚。这让我们内心空虚，因此我们才会摆出一副自信的样子。被恐惧和焦虑的恶魔攻击时，我们会装作无所畏惧。

每次遇到新的人，我们都会不自觉地想，这个人能为我证明自己的重要性做出什么贡献吗？因此，生活变成了一种不断的努力，利用他人来增强自我。于是就有了这种病态——骄傲，这是一种渴望荣耀、需要尊重的饥渴，一种想要确认自己存在的需求。

## 真正的谦卑是什么 / What True Humility Looks Like

So there's the sickness, pride, which is a hunger for glory, a need for respect, a need to be assured that we're real. What would health look like then?

If we didn't have this, what would health look like? And the answer is intriguing. It's all summed up in the word humility because see, keep on going.

He says in verse two, I want you to be unified. Verse three, a, the first part says, and the reason you're not is because of this emptiness, this vain glory, that's what the King James Bible, which is a little better, it translates, emptiness, you know, devoid of glory. Because of your emptiness, because of your pride, therefore, he says, starting verse 3B, and humility, consider others better than yourselves.

Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others. Boy, that tells you a lot, but let me, let's first of all look at the word humility. What is it?

It's a simple Greek word that means gentle, modest, deferential, gentle, modest, deferring to others. Outside of the New Testament, this Greek word, whenever it was used in any other kind of ancient Greek literature was always derocatory because in the Greco-Roman society, to be deferential and to be gentle and to be modest, was the attitude of a slave. See, that old society valued strength, and they believed that actually social stability was based on fear.

People had a respect to you, they treated you with respect, then society would hold together, and the only way for respect is that people feared you, gentleness, and deference, and modesty. That's for slaves, and yet this word in the Bible, or version of it, is used 270 times and almost always positively. You realize what a worldview revolution this was in Western culture, the humility, only Christianity comes along.

If you go back and you look at the Greeks and you look at the Aristotle and Plato, you look at all their emphasis on virtues, you'll never see humility in there. And yet, do you know how important humility is in the Bible? It's not just important.

I want you to think of something for a second. When Jesus says the meek, the humble will inherit the earth. When Jesus says, take my yoke upon me and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest of your souls.

What is he saying? Well, think about the gospel for a second. If you come to God and say, I want to have a relationship with you, look at all my accomplishments, look what I have done.

He's going to turn you away saying, you don't know who I am, you don't know who you are, you don't know what the cross of Jesus Christ means. But if you come and say, oh Lord, I repent, I need your grace, I have nothing with which to merit your favor, but I ask that you would save me for Jesus' sake, that's repentance and faith, you're saved by grace, you're saved through faith. But you know what that is?

It's humility. The only thing that can kill you, the only thing that can destroy you eternally is the lack of humility. You can lack almost any other thing, but not that, because that's what connects you to God.

In fact, if you want to think about it, basically God's plan of salvation is to lift up the humble. He says so in Luke 1. His plan of salvation is to lift up the humble.

You see how important it is. Well, what is it? Well, actually Paul gives a pretty good top level answer, but let me, since one of the advantages of this series has been to give people tools for self-evaluation, let me take you to Jonathan Edwards.

He is, he spent a great deal of time, is a Christian minister that spent a great deal of time thinking about spiritual growth and true Christianity, and in a couple of different places, he spends a fair amount of time treating the subject of what is the Bible say humility is. And I have summarized into four things what he says pride is, and therefore opposed, which is opposed to humility, and there are actually pretty good ways for me to look at my own life and to think about myself. He says pride is opposed to three or four things, and pardon me, pride is four things, and humility therefore is opposed to these four things.

Happiness, scorefulness, willfulness, and self-consciousness. Okay, think with me for a minute. First of all, humility is opposed to drivenness.

Be careful. It is very possible to be passionate and hard-working and desiring excellence because you love the thing that you are pursuing. If you pursue excellence in art or in music, if you pursue excellence in business or education or your academic field, it might be because you actually love the field.

It could be that, for example, you just love running and you love to see people run and you just love the athleticism of it, and if that's the reason why you are running and trying to run faster and faster as an athlete, if it's true that your competitiveness is a joy-driven competitiveness, then you will be almost as happy if your friend breaks the record as if you do. But that's not how it usually works, is it? Because our competitiveness is not driven by joy, it's driven by an inner vacuum.

This is the reason why there's a great place where C. S. Lewis says in his book, Merchristianity, he says, pride, real pride, gets no pleasure out of having something.

Pride only gets pleasure out of having more of it than the next person. You may think you're proud of being successful or intelligent or good-looking, but when surrounded by those who are equal or better than you, you lose all pleasure in those things. It's the comparison that makes you proud.

It's the pleasure of being above the rest. That's exactly right. So first of all, Jonathan Edwards says, here's how you can tell if you are a proud person.

You're driven. You need to succeed. You're always unhappy with...

You didn't do that well, you didn't do it right. You can do better. You're driven.

You're restless, but humility is content with circumstances, content with being imperfect. Humility is the opposite of drivenness. Think about that.

Secondly, humility is the opposite of scornfulness. By the way, sometimes you can be sarcastic, especially about a really, really wrongful thing, and you might want to use sarcasm to maybe get your point across. But in general, as I think Edwards rightly says, he says, treating others with contempt, jeering, ridiculing is always a manifestation of pride.

Why? Because you're putting people down. That's what we...

That's the metaphor we use. You're putting people down, so you can be above them. Instead, humility means treating all those who are lesser than you or opposed to you with courtesy, grace, and affability always.

So one of the ways you see pride is drivenness, humility is the opposite of that. One of the ways you see pride is scornfulness, mocking, sarcasm, all the time, putdowns, humility is the opposite of that. Thirdly, humility is the opposite of willfulness.

Edwards says that one of the marks of spiritual pride in churches is he says, spiritually proud people are always absolutely sure of every point of their beliefs. A proud person cannot admit they're wrong. Proud people can't admit they're wrong.

They can't take advice. They can't take correction. They don't like repenting if they repent.

It's always under duress. They're not teachable. They're not open to advice.

They're not willing to change their mind. They don't listen. They're not teachable.

So willfulness. So pride is opposite of drivenness, scornfulness, willfulness, and self-consciousness now. Now think about this with me for a minute.

When you and I think of proud people, we almost always think of arrogant people, but that's not the only form of pride. We think of people who are self-remotors and who are bragging all the time, but that's not the only form of pride. Oh no.

Because ultimately pride, the opposite of humility, is this insecurity. This need for honor, this need for glory, and that can be as much a manifestation, that can be as manifested as much through an inferiority feeling as a superiority feeling. Because if you're always down on yourself and you're always beating yourself up, or if you're afraid of compliments, you're afraid of any kind of attention, it's because you are just as painfully self-aware.

You're just as absorbed in thinking about yourself. You're looking at yourself and wondering, you know, how am I coming across as the person with a superiority complex? So humility is the opposite of self-consciousness.

With Christmas just around the corner, we are inviting people to sign up for our Advent devotional series, which you can receive daily from November 30th to December 24th. The daily meditations will help you take time to think about the meaning and joy that comes from Christ's birth. Each day of Advent, you'll receive a devotional with a meditation on a Bible passage that focuses on why Jesus came into the world to reconcile us to our Heavenly Father.

We believe that during this short season, this is a great tool to help you focus on the hope, joy, peace, and love we have through Christ's birth. You can sign up by visiting gospelonlife.com slash Advent. Again, to sign up, go to gospelonlife.com slash Advent.

In addition to the daily emails, you'll also receive a video message each Sunday. The weekly video message starts each week of Advent with a meditation from Tim Keller, followed by a brief discussion with Tim and Kathy talking about something they noticed in the meditation. It's our prayer that through this Advent series, you experience the hope and joy that comes from Christ's birth and that it is a source of encouragement to you this Advent season.

Now here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching. Listen, let me press this a little bit on you.

In the screw tape letters, there's a devil named screw tape, written by C. S. Lewis, and he is giving advice to his junior devil, nephew, on how to attempt a human being which he calls a patient.

Whenever you read something in a sermon out of screw tape letters, you have to turn yourself upside down, because the devil giving advice to another devil about how to attempt a human being. But listen to this, screw tape says, I see your patient has become humble. Have you drawn attention to the fact?

Catch him at the moment he's really poor in spirit and smuggle into his mind, I'm being humble. And pride in his own humility will appear. Now listen to this, abjection and self-hatred can do us such good, us demons, if they keep the man concerned with himself.

And self-contempt can be the starting point for a life contemptuous of all other cells and therefore a life filled with gloom, cynicism, and cruelty. So let your patient think of humility, not a self-forgetfulness, but as a low opinion of his own talents and character. And see, that brings us to the text itself, was so brilliant about this text is, he says, I want you to have humility, well, he describes it, what does that mean?

Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but to the interests of others. Look at that, he didn't say, hate yourself. Don't have any interests, don't have any goals, don't have any needs, he didn't say that.

Humility is what you're looking at. That's the reason why what screw tape is saying and what C. S.

Lewis is saying is, true humility is not thinking less of yourself or thinking more of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less. It's not noticing yourself because you're not glory hungry. It's not always worried about how are you looking.

It's not being down on yourself, it's not being up on yourself, it's just not talking and thinking about yourself so much. Did you hear what screw tape said? He says, self-hatred is a wonderful way to get people to be cynical and gloomy and cruel.

Because if you don't like yourself then you're not going to like other people and you're going to be very cruel to them. So you see, humility is the opposite of self-consciousness, self-awareness. Real humility is self-forgetfulness.

The best way I can illustrate this is your body parts. If you go to work tomorrow and somebody comes in saying, boy my elbows feel great. You're going to say, well the only reason anybody would ever say that is if yesterday their elbows didn't feel great because ordinarily if your elbows are working fine they don't draw attention to themselves.

It's somebody saying, oh man my knees are bending so well today. When I sit down they bend, when I stand up they unbend, it's just incredible. You got to figure, it must be that the knees weren't bending.

You would never even think about it unless there was something wrong. You don't think of your knees unless there's something wrong with them. You don't think of your elbows unless there's something wrong with them.

Okay now let's look at your ego. Your sense of self, if you were healthy you wouldn't even think about how you're doing and how you're looking, what people are saying about you, you wouldn't even think about it. You wouldn't be looking at yourself or your own interests, you'd be looking, see it other things, looking at God, looking at your neighbor, looking at everybody else.

And yet we, that's the truth. You're always thinking about yourself, how are you looking, you're always getting your feelings hurt, you're always getting your feeling insulted. You're feeling snub, you're feeling, you know, or here's a person over there that you want to like you more than really that he or she does.

So you're always thinking about yourself, why there's something wrong with your ego, just like if you're ever thinking about your elbow, there's something wrong with your elbow. We're not healthy. We're vain, glorious, we're lacking in glory.

And as a result, we're not humble at all. We're filled with drivenness, scornfulness, willfulness and self-consciousness.

那么，健康又会是什么样子呢？

二、健康状态：**真正的谦卑 如果我们没有这种心态，健康又会是**什么样子？答案令人惊讶，它可以用一个词来概括：谦卑。因为，继续看下去。他在第二节说，我希望你们能够合一。

第三节a部分说，而你们不能合一的原因是由于这种虚空、这种虚荣的荣耀，这是《钦定本圣经》稍微好一点的翻译，它将“虚空”译为“空洞无物”。因为你们的空洞无物，因为你们的骄傲，所以他从第三节b开始说，因此，谦卑，要以他人为重。你们每个人应当不仅关注自己的利益，也要关心别人的利益。这句话告诉你很多东西，但让我们首先来看看这个词——谦卑，它是什么意思？

这是一个简单的希腊词，意思是温和、谦逊、礼让、温和、谦逊、礼让他人。除了新约圣经之外，在任何其他类型的古代希腊文学中使用这个希腊词时，都是贬义的，因为在古希腊罗马社会里，谦逊和温柔被认为是奴隶的态度。你看，那个旧的社会崇尚力量，并且相信社会的稳定是基于恐惧。人们尊敬你，对你表示尊重，那么社会就会团结在一起，而获得这种尊重的方式就是让人们害怕你，温和、礼让和谦逊。

那是奴隶的态度，然而这个词在圣经中或其版本中出现了270次，几乎每次都用正面的意义。你意识到这在西方文化中是一种世界观的革命，谦卑，只有基督教才带来了这一点。如果你回溯历史，看看希腊人、亚里士多德和柏拉图，你会发现他们强调的所有美德中都没有谦卑。然而你知道吗？

圣经中谦卑的重要性如何？它不仅是重要的， 我想你们花一点时间思考一下。当耶稣说谦卑的人有福了，他们将承受地土；当耶稣说：“你们要背我的轭，学我的样式，因为我是谦卑温柔的”，你就会找到心灵的平安。他在说什么？

让我们再想想福音书的内容。如果你来到上帝面前，说：“我想和你建立关系，看看我取得了哪些成就，看看我已经做了什么。” 祂会告诉你，你不知道你是谁，你不知道我是谁，你不懂耶稣基督的十字架意味着什么。但如果你来，说：“主啊，我悔改了，我需要你的恩典，我没有能力配得你的恩宠，但我求你因耶稣的缘故拯救我。

”这就是悔改和信心，你就是借着恩典得救，你就是借着信心得救。但是你知道这是什么吗？那就是谦卑。唯一能杀死你、毁灭你永远的是缺乏谦卑。

你可以缺少几乎任何其他的东西，但不能缺少这一点，因为这正是连接你与上帝的纽带。事实上，如果你仔细想想，神拯救人的计划就是提升那些谦卑的人。他在路加福音1章中这样说。他的救赎计划是提升那些谦卑的人。

你看，谦卑是多么重要。那么它到底是什么呢？其实保罗给了一个很好的概括性回答，但让我来告诉你，由于这个系列的一个优点是提供自我评估的工具，让我带你去看看约翰·卫斯理。他花了很多时间思考灵性成长和**真正的基督教信仰，他在几个地方都花了相当多的时间讨论圣经中谦卑是**什么。

我总结了他所说的四点，这四点与骄傲相对立，因此也反对谦卑。实际上，我可以从这些方面来审视自己的生活，思考自己。他说，骄傲有四个方面，因此谦卑就对立于这四个方面。幸福、虚荣、任性、自我意识。

好，让我们想一想。首先，谦卑与追求成功是相对的。要小心。有可能你对所追求的事物充满热情并努力工作，是因为你真正爱上了那个领域。

比如你在艺术或音乐上追求卓越，或者在商业、教育或学术领域追求卓越，可能只是因为你热爱那个领域。也许，例如你喜欢跑步，并且喜欢看到别人跑，你仅仅喜爱那种运动的活力。如果你作为一名运动员追求更快的速度，而且你的竞争心是出于快乐的竞争心，那么即使你的朋友打破了记录，你也几乎会和自己打破记录一样开心。但通常情况并非如此，对吧？

因为我们的竞争心不是由快乐驱动的，而是由内心的空虚驱动。这就是为什么C.S.刘易斯在他的《基督再临》一书中提到骄傲的真实含义时说：真正的骄傲得不到任何乐趣。骄傲只以比别人拥有更多东西为乐。你可能认为自己因成功、聪明或外貌出众而自豪，但当周围的人与你一样优秀甚至更优秀时，你就失去了对这些事情的乐趣。

是那种比较让你感到骄傲。是那种在众人之上获得的快乐。完全正确。所以首先，乔纳森·爱德华兹说，你可以通过以下方式判断自己是否是一个骄傲的人：你是被驱使的，你需要成功。

你总是对自己的表现不满意…… 你没有做得很好，没有做对。你能做得更好。你是被驱使的。你不安分，但谦卑是满足于现状，接受自己的不完美。

谦卑与追求成功恰恰相反。想想这个。其次，谦卑与轻蔑截然相反。顺便说一句，有时候你可能会用讽刺的语气谈论一件非常不公正的事情，也许你想通过这种方式来传达你的观点。

但总的来说，正如爱德华兹正确指出的那样，轻视他人、嘲笑和嘲弄总是骄傲的表现。为什么呢？因为你是在贬低别人。这就是我们使用的比喻——你在贬低别人，好让自己高人一等。

相反，谦卑意味着你应当以礼貌、恩慈和友善的态度对待那些比你地位低下或与你意见相左的人。所以，一种骄傲的表现是急切，而谦卑恰恰相反。另一种骄傲的表现是轻蔑，包括嘲讽、讽刺、贬低他人等等，谦卑则与此相反。第三点，谦卑也与任性相反。

爱德华兹说，在教会中，精神上骄傲的人总是对自己的每一个信仰观点都坚信不疑。一个骄傲的人不能承认自己错了。骄傲的人无法接受别人的意见和纠正，他们不愿意悔改，如果悔改的话也只是在被迫的情况下才会这样做。他们不乐于学习，不开放心胸接受建议。

他们不愿改变自己的想法，也不愿意倾听。所以这就是任性。因此，骄傲与急切、轻蔑、任性相反。现在让我们想一想。

当我们想到骄傲的人时，我们几乎总是会想到那些自以为是的人，但这并不是骄傲的唯一形式。我们会想到那些自我孤立和经常夸耀自己的人，但这也不是骄傲的唯一形式。不，绝非如此。因为最终，骄傲——谦卑的对立面——其实是不安全感。

这种对荣誉的需求、对荣耀的渴望，可以表现为自卑感，也可以表现为优越感。如果你总是自责，总是看不起自己，或者害怕赞美，害怕任何形式的关注，那是因为你同样深刻地意识到自己的存在。你同样沉浸在自我思考中。你在观察自己，并且在想：我是不是显得太自以为是了？

所以谦卑是对抗自我意识的。随着圣诞节即将来临，我们邀请大家报名参加我们的圣诞灵修系列，从11月30日到12月24日每天都可以收到灵修内容。每日的反思将帮助你思考基督诞生的意义和喜悦。在每个圣诞日，你都会收到一个灵修内容，其中包含一段以耶稣为何来到世界与天父和解为主题的圣经经文反思。

我们相信，在这个短暂的季节里，这是一个很好的工具来帮助你专注于通过基督诞生所拥有的希望、喜乐、平安和爱。你可以通过访问gospelonlife.com/Advent进行报名。再次提醒，要报名，请访问gospelonlife.com/Advent。除了每日邮件外，每周日你还会收到一个视频信息。

每个圣诞周的开始，都会有蒂姆·凯勒的一段反思，随后是蒂姆和凯西简短讨论他们在反思中注意到的内容。我们祈祷通过这个圣诞系列，你能体验到基督诞生带来的希望与喜乐，并成为你在圣诞季节中的鼓励。现在给大家带来今天的其余教导的是凯勒博士，请听我说，我再强调一下这一点。在《 Screwtape Letters 》中，有一个名叫Screwtape的魔鬼，是C. S. Lewis所写，他在给他的年轻同事——侄子——关于如何尝试一个被称为“病人”的人类提供建议。

每当你们在布道中读到螺丝钉信件的内容时，必须翻转自己，因为这是魔鬼给另一个魔鬼提建议，如何试探人类。但请注意，螺丝钉说：“我看到你的病人变得谦卑了。你有没有注意到这一点？” 抓住他真正谦卑的那一刻，偷偷地将“我在谦卑”的想法植入他的心中。

于是自满就会出现在他对自己的谦卑中。现在请注意，自卑和自我厌恶对我们恶魔来说非常有益，如果它们让这个人一直关注自己。而自卑可以成为一种轻视所有其他细胞的生活起点，因此这种生活充满了阴郁、愤世嫉俗和残忍。所以让你的病人想到谦卑，不是自我的遗忘，而是对自己的才能和品格持有低下的看法。

现在看看这段经文本身，他关于这段经文如此精彩的描述是：“我希望你们有谦卑之心。”他说的是什么？他描述说：这到底意味着什么呢？每个人不仅要关注自己的利益，还要关注别人的利益。

请注意，他没有说“恨你自己”。不要有任何兴趣、目标或需求，他没有这么说。谦卑就是你要关注的。这就是螺丝钉所说的和C.S.刘易斯所说的真实谦卑的意义所在。

真实谦卑不是低估自己或高估自己，而是少关注自己。它不注意自己，因为你并不渴望荣耀。它不会总是担心你看起来如何。它不是自贬也不是自我夸耀，只是不多谈论和思考自己。

你们听到螺丝钉说了什么了吗？他说：“自卑是让人们变得愤世嫉俗、阴郁和残忍的绝佳方式。” 因为如果你不喜欢自己，你就不会喜欢别人，并且会非常残忍地对待他们。所以你看，谦卑与自省相反，是自我遗忘。

可以最直观地说明这一点的是你们的身体部位。假如明天你去上班，有人进来告诉你，我的胳膊肘感觉特别好。你会说，这唯一的原因就是昨天他们的胳膊肘没感觉这么好吧？因为通常情况下，如果胳膊肘正常工作的话，它们是不会引起注意的。

就像有人说，哎呀，今天我的膝盖弯曲得真好。坐着的时候能弯下来，站起来的时候又能伸直，简直太神奇了。你肯定要猜，一定是昨天膝盖没有正常弯曲。除非有问题，否则你根本不会想到它。

你的胳膊肘只有在有问题时才会引起注意。同样地，我们来看一下你们的自我意识。如果你健康的话，你甚至都不会去想自己怎么样、外表如何以及别人怎么说你。你会关注其他事物，比如上帝、邻居和所有人。

然而，这就是事实。你总是想着自己，担心自己的形象，总是在意别人的评价，总是感到受伤或被冒犯，总是觉得被人冷落。你总是希望某个人更喜欢你一些，但实际上他们并没有那么做。所以你总是想着自己，就像胳膊肘有问题一样，你的自我意识出了问题。

我们并不健康。我们是虚荣的、自大的，并且缺乏荣耀。因此，我们一点也不谦卑，而是充满冲动、轻蔑、任性以及自我意识。那该怎么办呢？

## 治愈之道：仰望基督的轨迹 / The Cure: Gazing at Christ's Trajectory

So what's the cure?

Well, I'd like to show you that this passage is giving us a top cure, it speaks broadly middle and practically too. It wasn't until fairly recently, as well as I've known this passage. This is one of the most famous passages in the Bible.

If you're a theological student and you're trying to learn what does the Bible teach about Christ, you study this thing, word for word, almost letter for letter. I know I did a long time ago, and it's an amazing, sweeping, magnificent hymn. It's a hymn.

Notice why it's laying on the page the way it is, looking like it's inverse because either Paul wrote this this way or else he was quoting somebody else's. But because of its lexical links, its parallelism, its rhythm, this is a hymn, this is a song. It's a hymn of praise to the deity of Jesus Christ, the greatness of who he is and what he's done.

Now, here's what I want to ask, here's the first question, and this is actually the first answer to the cure here. Why would Paul do this? He's talking about something very, very practical, humility and fighting in the church.

Very practical. And all of a sudden, he goes into this sweeping theological discourse, why? And here's the reason why.

You cannot work on humility directly. It's a byproduct of something else. You can't work on it directly.

Do you know what I mean by this? I mean, I've already, do you realize they've already gotten less and less humble as the minutes have gone by here? Don't you know why?

In other words, it's impossible to work on it directly. We kind of got that from the screw tape letters there. Real humility is not thinking about yourself, but that's what we're doing.

So for example, okay, you've got this little set of evaluation tools in your head now for a minute. I don't know how long they'll be there, but for a few days, you might remember, drivenness, scorefulness, willfulness, and self-consciousness. Okay, next time you see somebody being score-in-full, next time you see somebody being wilful, what are you going to do, you're going to go?

Proud. Not me, I'm not going to do that. The only way you can possibly work on humility is to really lose it, you know why?

Because you can't work on humility if humility self-forgetfulness. You can only work on not appearing proud. You can only work on appearances, which is to destroy it.

Humility is the shyest of virtues. You can't talk to humility without it going away. It just doesn't want to be there, okay?

And therefore you can't work directly on humility. You mustn't try to work directly on humility. Well then what are you supposed to do?

You're supposed to look at someone else. And this isn't just theology, this is a hymn. It's written to be chanted or to be recited or to be sung.

And what is Paul saying? Paul saying, the way we're going to fix what is most wrong with us in our center. You've got to see Jesus, you've got to have the theology, you have to biblical doctrine on fire in your heart, something you praise God for, something that captures your imagination.

Who Jesus is and what He has done. And it's doctrine on fire, theology on fire in your heart. Humility is a byproduct of wanting something more than to be humble.

Because if you want to be humble, it's all about you. It's all about you. If you want to be humble, why would you want to be humble?

Except I mean I don't want to look proud or I want to be right or I want to, you know, you've got to want him, you've got to worship him, you've got to see him. Humility is a byproduct of wanting something more than humility. Wanting him first.

That's the top, that's the first part of the cure, the second part of the cure though. This is not just doctrine in general, look at what it is, it's a trajectory. In fact, somebody said that this passage of verses 5 to 11 is actually a symphony in three movements.

The first movement is incarnation, though he was God, he became human. The second motion is to atonement, though he was human, he didn't just have a nice comfortable life, but he went to the cross. And the third movement is up.

He comes down, he goes even lower, therefore God has highly exalted him. Now what did he do? Here's what he did.

This is the heart of it all. Right in the center of this passage, it says, in the very nature God, he did not count equality with God, something to be grasped in verse 7, but made himself nothing. Now do you know what that word is, the Greek word?

Kenosis. Kenosis, does that sound familiar to you? Yes.

It says he emptied himself, though he was God, he emptied himself. And the big question that theologians have been asking for about 2,000 years is emptied himself of what? It doesn't say, he just says he emptied himself.

And some people have said, oh, of course he was God, so he emptied himself of his deity, he emptied himself of his divinity, but that's not what it says. It never says that he gave up being God, it says he started being a servant. He did not shed his divine nature, he assumed a human nature, and more than that he became not just a king, he became a servant.

And there it is. He emptied himself of his glory, not his deity, what? Yeah, listen, in heaven, if you were transported to heaven, then or now?

And you saw Jesus as God, his godness manifested itself through an expression of glory, his beauty, his brightness. It would just knock you down. When you see something beautiful, when you see a piece of art or a waterfall or anything, it's just absolutely beautiful, even even earthly things that are beautiful, you've got to adore, right?

It's so glorious, it just evokes adoration, but Jesus Christ came without that. Isaiah 53 says, he had no beauty that we should desire him. He emptied himself of his glory, he emptied himself of his beauty, he emptied himself of that which evokes honor.

And so he came, and he was lonely, and he was poor, and eventually he was beaten, and he was tortured, and he was killed. He emptied himself of his glory, he became small, not a king at all. He became rejected, he became beatable, and he was beaten, right?

He became rejectable, and he was rejected. He lost all of his glory, he came out of his glory, he didn't stop being God, but he emptied himself of his glory. Therefore God has highly exalted him.

Why? Why is he resurrected? Why is he up there?

Because he saved us. He took our punishment upon himself, so he's redeemed the new humanity, and he's leading us into the future, and so there it is, there's a trajectory. What is a trajectory, everybody?

The way up is down. The way to be truly rich is to give away. The way to rule is to serve, and the way to become infinitely happy is to not seek your own happiness, but seek the happiness of others.

And the most glorious thing of all, the greatest form of glory is to give away your glory for somebody else. And now you see the word Kenosis shows up twice, and look at it. You and I are desperately trying to fill ourselves with glory, but we end up empty.

But Jesus Christ who had true glory emptied himself, so we could be full, full, yes. Because Jesus Christ became small, we are big in the eyes of the Father. Because Jesus Christ lost all of his glory, we are now given His righteousness and His record.

This is what the gospel is. That Jesus Christ was treated the way we deserve, so now when we believe in Him we are treated as He deserves to be treated. And you know what this means?

Jesus Christ looks at you and says, to me and in me, you are more precious than all the jewels that lie beneath the earth. To the degree you know that and believe that. To the degree you are gripped and you are praising God and you're singing about Jesus trajectory for you, you will be able to walk that same trajectory here.

Because you will know the way up is down. The way to be rich is to give away. The way to be happy is not to seek your own happiness, but the happiness of others.

And when you say that He did that for you, that fills you up so you're not empty anymore and you'll be able to not have to think about yourself and how you go. Let me give you just one practical thing on this.

我想通过这段经文给你们提供一个根本性的解决方案，它不仅广泛适用，而且非常实用。直到最近，我才真正理解了这段经文的重要性。这是《圣经》中最著名的段落之一。如果你是一名神学学生，试图学习圣经关于基督的教导，你会逐字逐句地研究这段经文。

我以前也这样做过，这是一首令人惊叹、宏伟壮丽的赞美诗。它确实是一首赞美诗。注意为什么这段经文排版如此，看起来像是倒过来的，要么是保罗这样写的，要么他引用了别人的。但因为它的词汇联系、平行结构和节奏感，这是一首赞美诗，一首歌颂耶稣基督神性的伟大和他所做之事的赞美诗。

现在我要问的第一个问题是：为什么保罗会这样做？他在谈论非常实际的事情——谦卑和教会中的争斗。这是非常实际的问题。然后他突然进入了一段宏大的神学论述，为什么呢？

这里有一个原因。你无法直接培养谦卑。它是由其他事物产生的副产品。你不能直接去培养它。

你知道我的意思吗？我指的是，你们已经越来越不谦卑了，不是吗？你们知道这是为什么吗？换句话说，直接培养谦卑是不可能的。

我们从《螺丝在拧紧》中得到了这一点启示。**真正的谦卑并不是**想着自己，但这是我们一直在做的事情。举个例子，你脑子里现在有一套小小的评估工具，不知道能持续多久，但至少几天内你会记得：自大、好胜、任性、自我意识。下次当你看到有人表现得非常自大，或者非常任性的行为时，你会怎么做？

骄傲。不是我，我不那样做。唯一可能培养谦卑的方式就是彻底失去它，你知道为什么吗？因为你无法直接培养谦卑，因为它涉及自我遗忘。

你只能关注外在的表现，去摧毁它。谦卑是最害羞的美德之一。你不能与谦卑交谈而不让它消失。它就是不想存在。

因此，你不能直接去培养谦卑。你必须不要试图直接去培养谦卑。那么，你应该怎么做呢？你应该看看别人。

这不仅仅是神学，这也是一首圣诗。它被写来要被吟唱、诵读或歌唱。保罗在说什么？保罗说，我们要修复我们内心最需要修复的部分，就必须看到耶稣，我们必须让圣经的教义在心中燃烧，这是你赞美上帝的东西，是能激发你想象的东西。

耶稣是谁，他做了什么。这是一颗燃烧着的教义之火、神学之火在你心中的体现。谦卑是你渴望更多于谦卑的一个副产品。因为如果你想要谦卑，那都是关于你自己。

如果你想要谦卑，为什么你要想变得谦卑呢？我说的是，我并不想显得骄傲，我想成为正确的人，或者你想……你必须爱他、敬拜他、看见他。谦卑是你渴望更多于谦卑的一个副产品，首先渴望他。这是顶点，这是治愈的第一部分。

然而，治愈的第二部分是什么呢？这不仅仅是泛泛的教义，看看它是什么，这是一个轨迹。事实上，有人说过，这段经文从第五节到第十一节实际上是一首三乐章的交响曲。第一个乐章是道成肉身，虽然他是神，但他成了人。

第二个乐章是赎罪，虽然他成了人，他没有过着舒适的生活，而是上了十字架。第三个乐章是上升。他下来了，甚至更低，因此上帝大大地高举了他。现在他做了什么？

这就是核心所在。在这段经文的中心位置，它说，在神的本质中，他没有将与神同等视为可以抓取的东西（英文原文为“grasped”，此处翻译为中文），而是使自己变得卑微。你是否知道这个希腊词是什么？肯西奥斯（kenosis）。

肯西奥斯这个词听起来熟悉吗？是的。它说他谦卑自己，虽然他是神，却谦卑自己。这个从两千年前开始困扰神学家们的大问题是：他谦卑的是什么？

经文没有明说，只是说他谦卑了。有些人认为，当然他是神，所以他谦卑的是他的神性、他的神圣性，但这不是经文的意思。它从来没有说他放弃了他的神性，而是说他开始成为仆人。他并没有舍弃他的神性，而是承担了人性，并且不仅如此，他不仅成了王，还成了仆人。

这就对了。他谦卑的是他的荣耀，而不是他的神性。什么？听我说，在天堂里，如果你被带到天堂，过去或现在？

你会看到耶稣作为神的荣耀显现出来，他的神圣性通过荣光、美丽和光辉表现出来，会让你震撼不已。当你看到美丽的事物，比如艺术品或瀑布或其他任何东西时，它们都是如此美丽，即使只是地球上的美丽事物，你也会不由自主地赞叹，对吧？它的荣耀让人不禁赞美，但耶稣基督却来的时候没有这些。以赛亚书53章说：“他外貌俊美，必被藐视。

”他谦卑的是他的荣耀、他的美丽，那些让他受到尊敬的东西。所以他来了，孤独、贫穷，最终被打、受苦、被杀。他谦卑了荣耀，变得渺小，不再是王。他被拒绝，可以被打败，并且确实被打败了。

他被拒斥，确实被拒斥。他失去了所有的荣耀，离开了他的荣耀，但他并没有停止是神，而是谦卑了他的荣耀。因此，神高举他。为什么？

为什么他复活了？为什么他在天上？因为他拯救了我们。他承担了我们的惩罚，所以赎回了新人类，并引领我们走向未来。

这就对了，这就是一个轨迹。什么是轨迹？大家都知道吧？上山的路是下山。

真正富有的道路是舍去。统治的道路是服侍，而成为无穷快乐的道路是不寻求自己的幸福，而是寻求别人的幸福。最荣耀的事情莫过于舍弃自己的荣耀为别人。现在你看，“空虚”这个词出现了两次，看看它。

你和我拼命地想要填满自己的荣耀，结果却变得空空如也。但耶稣基督拥有**真正的荣耀，祂却把自己空虚了，好让我们得以充满——充满，是**的。因为耶稣基督变得谦卑，我们在父的眼中就显得伟大；因为耶稣基督失去了所有的荣耀，我们如今得到了祂的公义和记录。这就是福音。

耶稣基督承受了我们所应得的惩罚，所以当我们信靠祂时，我们就获得了祂所应得的待遇。你知道**这意味着什么吗？耶稣基督看着你，对你说：“在我和我里面，你比地底下所有的宝石都更宝贵。**”你越知道这一点并相信这一点，你就越会被抓住，赞美上帝，并歌唱耶稣为你的人生轨迹。

这样，你就能在这条道路上行走。因为你会明白上山的路是下山，**真正的富有是**舍去，而幸福不是寻求自己的幸福，而是别人的幸福。当你这样说时，祂为你的付出会填满你的心灵，使你不再空虚，也不再需要思考自己和未来。让我给你一个实际的例子。

## 放下名誉的实践 / Letting Go of Reputation

I've already told you that it will sense you can't work on your humility, but you can work on your pride.

Here's what I remember. This King James version, the King James version of Philippians 2.7 is, he made himself of no reputation. And I remember some years ago, one of the humblest men I've ever worked with was a pastor on our staff named Dick Kaufman, he was here in the 90s.

And I always wanted to know, you can't say to a humble person, what is the secret of your humility? Because if they answer, you'd have to go find somebody else. And you've ruined them right there.

And I was like, oh, well, thank you. Yeah, let me think about it. I guess it must be, no, you don't want that.

You don't want that at all. But I do remember one day, he confessed to me that there are two things that he couldn't stand, hardly. One is when he didn't do his best.

And the other was when he got real sharp unfair criticism. You know, he said, if I get good criticism, okay, if I get unfair criticism, or if I feel like I didn't do my best, I said, so why does that bother you so much? He says, because there's nothing more important to me, unfortunately, than my reputation.

There's nothing more important to me than my reputation. It means everything to me. If I think anything is hurting my reputation, then I just start to fall apart.

And he says, but here's what I've learned to do, and it's really helped. I meditate on Philippians 2.7. I realize Jesus made Himself of no reputation.

He lost His reputation for me. And if His reputation didn't mean anything for Him, if He gave it up for me, then I can give it up for Him. Do you know how to do that?

Is there a place in your life? Is there a spot in your prayer life? Is there a place where you regularly hear Jesus say, in me and to me, you are more precious than all the jewels that lie beneath the earth?

So why the heck do you care if somebody snubbed you? How do you mind what you look like there? Who cares about your reputation?

When you know that I love you like this? Is there a place where something like that happens in the depths of your soul? See, that's how you develop humility, not by looking at yourself, but by looking at Him.

I heard a story some years ago about a young man who went into a little British town to climb the mountain right behind the town, and they all said, oh, no, look, it's higher than you think. It's the weather's worse than you think, but he was sort of overconfident, and he didn't go up with a appropriate gear, and he thought he knew what he was doing. So he walked out of the village one morning to go up the mountain with his head held high, and several hours he came back crestfallen, he hadn't even gotten halfway up, and it was an old lady who saw him come back in and said, son, if you'd gone up the way you came down, you would have come down the way you went up, which is another way of saying, humble yourself under the mighty hand of God, and he will exalt you in due time.

Let's pray. Father, we thank you for this, the gift of humility, which is not something that we ever get if we ask for it, look for it, see whether we've got it or not, it's a shy virtue. But we know this, that if we look at you, and we look at your humility, and we look at what you've done for us, and we just look at it and look at it and look at it until it catches fire in our hearts until it moves us to tears, it's going to change us.

We will not be as marked by drivenness and squirtfulness and willfulness in self-consciousness. So we pray that you would make us, like your son, who came not to be served but to serve and give his life a ransom for many. Jesus and we pray, amen.

我已经告诉你，你无法直接提升自己的谦卑，但可以努力减少骄傲。我记得一件事。《钦定本》腓立比书2章7节是这样说的：“祂本有神的形像，竟将自己空虚了。”我还记得多年前，我曾与一位我们团队中最谦逊的人之一共事过，他的名字叫迪克·考夫曼牧师，在90年代他在这里工作。

我一直想知道，你不能问一个谦卑的人，你的秘诀是什么？因为如果他们回答，你就得去找另一个人。这样就毁掉了他们。我还想，哦，好的。

嗯，让我想想。我想大概是这样，不过你不想那样。你一点也不想那样。但我记得有一天，他向我承认，有两件事让他几乎无法忍受。

一是当他没有做到最好时；另一件是当受到非常不公平的批评时。他说：“如果我收到的是好建议，可以接受，但如果收到的是不公平的批评，或者我觉得自己没有尽力，为什么这会让你如此烦恼？”我说：“因为对你来说，没有什么比名誉更重要吗？”他回答说：“不幸的是，对我来说，我的名誉比什么都重要。

” 他的名誉对他来说意味着一切。他认为任何损害他名誉的事情都会让他崩溃。他说，但他学到的一件事真的很有帮助，那就是冥想腓立比书2章7节的内容。耶稣使自己成为无名誉的。

祂为了我舍弃了自己的名誉。如果祂的名誉对他来说不重要，祂愿意为我放弃，那么我也能为祂放弃。你知道怎么做吗？你生活中有没有这样的地方？

你的祷告生活里有没有这样的时刻？你是否经常听到耶稣对你说，在我里面和对我而言，你比地底下所有的宝石都珍贵？那你为什么在乎有人冷落你呢？你为什么在意自己的形象呢？

谁会在乎你的名誉呢？当你知道我是这样爱你的时候？你灵魂深处有没有这样的地方发生过类似的事情？你看，这就是谦卑的培养方式——不是通过自我审视，而是通过仰望祂。

我几年前听了一个故事，讲的是一个年轻人去了英国的一个小镇，想要爬镇后边的山。大家都说那座山比看起来要高，天气也比想象中糟糕得多。但他有点过于自信了，没有带足够的装备就出发了，以为自己知道怎么应对。于是他一大早就从村子里出发，昂首挺胸地去爬山。

几个小时后，他垂头丧气地回来了，连一半的路都没走到。一个老妇人看到了他回来的样子，说："小伙子，如果你是沿着你上来的路下去，你就会找到上来时的路。"这其实就是让我们谦卑自己，在上帝的大能手下屈服，祂会在适当的时候提升我们。让我们祷告。

天父，感谢祢赐给我们谦卑这一礼物，这是我们在寻求、寻找或自我检查中永远得不到的羞涩美德。但我们知道，如果我们仰望你，看到你的谦卑，看到你为我们所做的一切，然后反复思考直到这种谦卑在我们心中燃起火焰，感动到流泪，这会改变我们。我们将不再被急躁、冲动和自以为是所左右。因此，求祢让我们像祢的儿子一样，祂来不是要被人服侍，而是要服侍人，并且舍弃自己的生命作为多人的赎价。
