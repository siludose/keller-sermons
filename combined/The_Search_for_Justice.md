## 传道者的追寻 / The Preacher's Quest

No, well, what's it doing here? Because the key phrase, which comes up several times in this text, and it comes up dozens of times in the book of Ecclesiastes, it comes up nowhere else in any book of the Bible. In fact, it comes over nowhere else in any part of literature.

Is the term, under the sun. And what this means is, he does not say, this is true, this is true, this is true, this is a fact, this is a fact. He says, this is a fact under the sun, this is true, under the sun, under the sun.

This life is meaningless. What? Not just life is meaningless.

This life is meaningless under the sun. What does that mean? It means this life, understood without any reference to life above the sun, or beyond the sun.

In other words, this life without reference to there being an eternity or heaven, this life, if this life is all there is, that's what life under the sun means. And what's so helpful about this guy, is the point of view he takes, is not a philosophical atheism, but it's very much, frankly, it's very much the practical secularism of the average New Yorker and increasingly the average Western person. When I say practical secularism, notice he uses the word God a couple times.

He talks about the meaningless life that God has given us, but you see, in the book of Ecclesiastes, God is not the biblical God. The judge of heaven and earth, the lover of our souls. If you ask the average New Yorker, do you believe in God?

There's very few atheists. There's very few rigorous philosophical doctrinaire atheists who say there can't be a God. The average person says, yes, there's probably some kind of supreme being, but we can't know what that God thinks, or we can't know that God, we can't know the will of God.

And therefore, essentially, this life is all there is. We don't know why we're here. And after you're dead, that's it.

And therefore, you've got to kind of make the best of it. That's practical secularism. And the book of Ecclesiastes gets into that position and says, okay, you're practical secularists.

How does life really look? And then he goes after in the book, and we're going to take these next three weeks on these three. He says, let's take a look at the three basic projects that all human beings have got to do.

If you're going to live the basic projects, so you can't avoid. And even if you don't think you're doing them, you have to do them because you can't live without avoiding them. And the three basic projects are justice, pleasure, and achievement.

Achievement is, what is worth doing in my life? What am I going to spend my life doing? You know, what should I be doing?

Pleasure is, where will I find happiness? What will satisfy me really? And thirdly, how do I deal with the injustice and the evil and suffering I see in the world?

You can't live without asking those questions or essentially answering them, even if you don't think you're answering them, you are answering them. And he says, all right, let's just say, here's the reason that the book of Ecclesiastes is so unusual and it's so helpful. And why a book eventually brings you to God, because the book of Ecclesiastes is not just doubt, belief.

The great thing about the book, and it's so democratic when you think about it, the Ecclesiastes are also doubts on belief. Now this is something that almost nobody does. Now as people know, yeah, well, yes, let's doubt belief, but let's not doubt it.

You say, it wouldn't be fair would it to only doubt belief, only doubt faith. Surely if you're going to doubt faith and ask very hard questions about faith, wouldn't you doubt your doubts? Shouldn't you doubt your doubts?

Shouldn't you ask hard questions about unbelief? You say, you're standing someplace even when you doubt. You can't doubt without standing someplace.

And a practical secularism secularism says, this life is all there is. Okay, says the writer. Let's ask a few questions about that position.

他说人生是毫无意义的，但你看，在《传道书》中，“上帝”并不是圣经中的那位上帝——天上的审判者、我们灵魂的爱人。如果你问一个普通的纽约人：“你相信有上帝吗？” 几乎没有人是无神论者，几乎没有严格的哲学教条无神论者会说不可能存在上帝。大多数人可能会说：“可能有一个至高的存在，但我们不知道上帝的想法，或者我们无法知道上帝的意志。

” 因此，基本上来说，人生就是全部。我们不知道自己为何而生。你死了之后，就完了。因此，你得尽量适应它。

这就是实用的世俗主义。而《传道书》也谈到这一点，并说：你们就是实用的世俗主义者。生活到底是什么样的？书中接着探讨了这个问题，在接下来的三周里，我们将逐一讨论这三个基本项目。

如果你要过一种最基本的生活，那么这些是你无法避免的。即使你不认为自己在做这些事情，你也必须去做它们，因为你不能逃避它们。这三大基本项目是正义、快乐和成就。成就指的是：在我的生命中，什么是有价值去做的？

我将用我的一生去做什么？你知道，我应该做什么？快乐是指：我在哪里能找到幸福？什么能真正使我满意？

最后，如何应对这个世界中存在的不公、邪恶和痛苦？你无法逃避这些问题或本质上回答它们。即使你不认为自己在回答，你也已经在做了。他说道，《传道书》之所以独特且富有帮助，因为它不仅仅是对信仰的怀疑，而是一种信仰。

这本书的伟大之处在于，它非常民主。《传道书》不仅是对信仰的怀疑，也是对信仰的质疑。这几乎没有人能做到。人们知道，是的，我们应该怀疑信仰，但不应该怀疑这些怀疑本身。

你不能只怀疑而不站在某个立场上。当你怀疑时，你总是在某处站立。实用的世俗主义说：这就是我们所有的生活。作者说，让我们对这个观点提出一些问题。

第一，你是如何面对生活的不公？现在，当他这样做时，你们中的一些人今天面临的主要灵性问题就是这个。这是主要的问题。这不仅是与神、信仰或一切事物的主要问题，因为你已经看到了或经历过这种苦难。

对于你们中的其他人来说，这可能不是主要问题。我们会在其他周讨论这个问题，但仍然非常重要。你是如何面对不公的？现在，让我们看看这个人是如何做的，我只能列出三点。

首先，他拒绝让你避开不公正的问题；其次，他给了我们两个答案，即两种解决不公的方法。首先，他拒绝让你避开问题。他会把问题摆在你面前，不会让你忽视它。然后，第二点是，他还给我们提供了两种解决问题的线索。

让我们看看他是如何确保你不避开这个问题的。这很容易被忽略。在第11和12节中，他开始谈论生活中随机的一般不公正，并说： “赛马场上跑得快的未必能赢；战场上勇猛的人不一定能胜出；聪明人不一定能得到食物，智慧人不一定能积累财富，学者也不一定受到青睐，因为时间与机遇对所有人都一样。正如渔夫被撒网捕获，鸟儿被陷阱捉住，人们也会在突如其来的恶运中陷入困境。

” 我读到的一位作者为了准备这次讲道，一个晚上把电视新闻中每条新闻开头的几句话都记了下来，结果如下： 中东再次出现麻烦。今天，三名恐怖分子袭击了一辆校车并引爆了炸弹，导致他们和所有孩子丧生。孟加拉国遭遇了一场大风暴，数千人被淹死，数十万人无家可归。261号高速公路发生四辆车连环相撞事故，造成五人死亡。

在布朗克斯区，一名五岁的小女孩坐在她母亲的怀里，被流弹击中身亡。还有一条是研究性质的内容。成千上万的“两 thirds 世界”的儿童因可预防的疾病每天丧生，这背后是懒惰、自私和不可战胜的无知。人们有能力救治他们却选择不这样做。

这话是什么意思？这就是所罗门书作者想要表达的观点。无论你是谁，无论你在哪儿，无论你善还是恶，可怕的事情无时不在发生，毫无公正可言，真是疯狂。它可能发生在任何人身上。

## 面对不公 / Confronting Injustice

And the first one is, how do you deal with justice, the injustice of life? Now, when he does this, some of you today, this is the main spiritual issue you've got. This is the main problem.

This is the main problem with God, with faith, with everything, because you have seen or you've experienced this kind of suffering. For some of the rest of you, it's not maybe the main problem. That's what we're going to do some other weeks, but it's still very important.

How do you deal with injustice? Now here's what this guy does, and I'm going to only be able to outline three things he does. First of all, he refuses to let you avoid the question of injustice, and then secondly, he gives us two answers, clues to two answers.

First of all, he refuses to let us avoid the question. He puts the question in front of us. He refuses to let us tune it out, and then secondly, and then he gives us the clues for two answers, two answers for how to deal with injustice.

First of all, let me show you, look how he makes sure you do not avoid the question. This is very easy to tune out. In verse 11 and 12, first of all, he's tear talking about the random general injustice in life, and he says, what?

He says, the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise, nor wealth to the brilliant, or favorite of the learned, but time and chance happens to all. And moreover, as Fischer caught in a cruel net, birds would take it in a snare, men are trapped by evil times that fall unexpectedly upon them. One writer I was reading for a pairing for this, one night just took down the first couple sentences of every news story on this TV news, and here's what he got.

There was trouble in Middle East again tonight. Today, three terrorists come and dear to school bus and set off explosives that killed both themselves and all the children. A major storm hit Bangladesh, thousands were drowned, tens of thousands are homeless.

Four car pile up on 261 resulted in five deaths. In the Bronx, a five-year-old girl in her mother's lap was killed by a stray bullet. And here was one that's a little more of a research thing.

Thousands of two-thirds world children die daily from largely preventable diseases out of complacency and selfishness and invincible ignorance that people with the power to treat them simply fail to do so. Now, what is that saying? It's what the Ecclesiastes writer is trying to say.

It doesn't matter who you are, where you are, it doesn't matter whether you're good or bad. Horrible things happen constantly, random without just, it's crazy. It can happen anybody.

Suddenly beautiful little children blown up. Suddenly this, suddenly that, it's like, and as he says, it can happen anybody. It can happen anytime.

You can't avoid it and you never know when it's going to happen. The random misery and cruelty of the world, the injustice of life, that's the first thing he brings up. He says, look at that.

The race is not to the swift, you see. You may be swift, but you may lose. You may be brilliant, but you may may not succeed because, frankly, life is a crap shoot.

You think you're under control. If you think you're under control, you think if I just do this and do this and this, things are going to go well for me. You're very, very young.

I mean, I say interesting. I do that way. Every two months, I say that somehow and everybody laughs because you are young, or maybe it's only the old people left.

I better watch careful next time. You are not in control. One of the ways that young people tune out the injustice of life is they say, it's those people.

It's not going to happen to me. I'm going to watch my back. I'm going to be very careful.

I'm going to discipline myself. I'm not going to ride on school buses in the Middle East. I'm going to have all sorts of things.

突然间，美丽的孩童被炸得支离破碎；突然间，这事儿发生了，那事儿又来了，就像他说的，它可能发生在任何人身上，随时可能发生。你无法避免这一切，你也永远不知道它会在何时何地发生。这个世界的随机苦难和残忍、生活的不公，正是他首先提到的东西。他说，看看这些。

赛跑并非属于最快的人。你看，你也许很快，但你可能会输；你也许很聪明，但可能不会成功，因为坦白地说，生活就是一场赌博。你以为自己掌控一切。如果你以为自己掌控了一切，认为只要我这样做、那样做，事情就会顺利进行，那你太年轻了。

我说这话的意思是有趣。我总是这么说，每隔两个月大家都会笑一次，因为你们还很年轻，或者可能只有老人才会这样想。下次我要小心点。你并不在掌控之中。

年轻人逃避生活不公的一种方式就是认为这是那些人的错，这不会发生在我的身上。我会多加小心，我会严格要求自己，我不会坐校车去中东。但他不会就此罢休。他继续说。

现在，当他继续时，我想你们中的一些人会开始为自己辩解，因为你可能会说他在说些悲观的话。等一下，他说：“是的，有这样的人。”接下来他会怎么做呢？他继续说。

他越过那些偶然发生的普遍不公，转向每个人都会面临的终极不公。正如经文3和4节所说：“正直人的道路，众人都知道；恶人的心，焉能明白呢？以咒诅起誓的，和以应许起誓的一样；敬畏神的，就是这二者。”这就是太阳底下一切邪恶的本质。

我往下看到了第5节：活著的人知道要死，死了的人却不知道。他们不再有报酬，他们的名字也被人遗忘。他们的爱恨、嫉妒早已烟消云散。无论他们在世上做了什么，都不会再有任何意义。

这里他要说的是： 他不只是在说，好人受苦而坏人得利就是不公，这是不公正的一部分，但并非全部。他说，不论你一生如何度过——是充满爱心的一生，还是充满仇恨的一生；是恐怖分子，还是孩子，你所做的都会消失无踪。更糟糕的是，连你所做的一切记忆和影响也会被遗忘。对每一个生命而言，在这世上如果只有这一生，那么在你愿意思考的时候，这种虚无感会让你觉得一切努力都毫无意义。

凯西和我最近看了一部约翰·塞尔斯的新电影《枪手》，非常精彩。这部电影讲述了一位拉丁美洲国家的医生训练了一批年轻的医生，他们前往偏远贫困地区，为那些急需医疗服务的人提供帮助。当他意识到几乎每一个他训练过、坐在那里的人，都被军队或猩猩杀害了之后，他所做的一切和他们为之付出的努力都化为乌有。电影基本上讲述的是他一次次进入极其危险的地方，只为找到每一位年轻的生命，但他始终找不到他们，最后在影片的结尾，他去世了，临终前说：“一个男人应该留下一些遗产。

” 在电影中的一刻，他说：“我不是一个宗教人士，我不是一个宗教人士，我是一个科学家，一个医生，但我希望我知道自己是否为这个地方做了一些好事。” 否则，我的生命就毫无意义。而传道书的作者则说：醒醒！他们难道还没死吗？

听我说，如果你建造了金字塔，你将会比我们其他人更长久地被人记住。但最终，当你死去时，你会腐烂；当太阳消逝时，一切都会腐烂，宇宙性的遗忘在每个人的生命尽头等待着每一个人，无论你做了什么，无论你是谁，同样的命运将降临于你，这使你所做的一切变得毫无意义。现在有人会说：我知道你想说什么，他说：“哦，我听过这个，在哲学101课上我就听过了，这种说法听起来很悲观。” 你要知道，即使你这么想，如果你是一个务实的世俗主义者，你会说：当然，如果你这么想，你会一直感到沮丧。

但是嘿，中央公园、剧院、性爱、令人惊叹的餐馆和美妙的衣服都在那里等着你。他从你这里听过这些话，并且在第7节中，他说得更进一步，他已经听过了，听了一百次了，人们说：“哦，是啊，如果你用哲学思维去思考，一切都是无意义的，但让我们出去过正常人的生活吧。” 于是他说：好吧，当然可以。所以，7节，你们要吃你们的食物，以欢喜快乐的心喝你们的酒，穿白袍，快快乐乐地过活。

吃得香甜，穿着漂亮，心里欢畅，好让你们的日子充满喜乐，现在我不打算在接下来两篇讲道里多谈这个问题了：你们要吃你们的食物，以欢喜快乐的心喝你们的酒；穿戴洁白的衣服，快乐度日；与你所爱的人同享人生。圣经上说：“看哪！你不知道耶和华为你预备的是什么。”听我说，这一切都是虚空的，终将破碎，不重要。

他其实是在说：不要忽视这一点，伟大的人们总是这样想的，比如佛陀、悉达多，在成为佛陀之前，他在宫殿里长大，没有见过苦难。直到有一天，当他第一次看到一个老人，第二天看到一个病人，第三天看到一个死人，他才意识到这一切都会降临到每个人身上。传说中，有一次，他转向他的车夫说：“在这样的情况下，人们的心必须变得坚强才能保持镇定。”他开始哭泣道：“衰老。

## 超越死亡与虚空 / Beyond Death and Vanity

But he won't stop there. He goes on. Now, when he goes on, I want you to know right away, some of you are going to start to defend yourself against what he says here, because you're going to say he's just being gloomy.

I'll get back to that. He says, oh yeah, there's people like this. Here's what he does.

He goes on. He goes on past the random general injustice that happens to so many people, and he moves to the absolute ultimate injustice that happens to everybody. That, in verse 3 and 4, as it is with a good man, so with a sinner, as it is with those who take oath, so with those who are afraid to take them.

This is the evil in everything that happens under the sun. I looked down at verse 5, for the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing. They have no further reward, and even the memory of them is forgotten.

Their love and their hate, their jealousy, have long since vanished. Never will they have a part in anything that happens under the sun. Here's what he's saying.

He is not just saying here. They good people have it bad and bad people have it good. That's injustice, and that often happens.

That's sort of random thing. He's saying something else. Something deeper.

He says, no matter what you do in life, whether you live a life of look, a life of love, verse 6, or hate, whether you are the terrorist or the child. Everything you do will vanish, but worse than that, even the memory of what you do, even the effect of what you do will be forgotten. At the end of the road for every human being, if this life is all there is, there is a nothingness that if you're willing to think about it at all, and I'm making you, he says, makes everything you do meaningless, everything you do.

Kathy and I recently watched on video one of the latest John Sales movie called Men with Guns, Powerful Movie. In the movie, it's about a doctor in a Latin American country who has trained a bunch of young doctors, and they have gone up into the hinterland, they've gone up into the parts of the country. They're very remote and very poor, and those doctors were going to give health care to people who desperately needed it.

And when he came to understand that virtually every single one of the people that he had trained and sat out there had been killed either by the army or by the gorillas almost immediately, so that everything he'd done and all that they'd put their lies into was gone. He goes, the whole movie is basically about him going into one incredibly dangerous place after another to just find every one of those young people, and he never can find them, and the very end he dies, his last words are, a man should have a legacy. And at one point in the movie, he says, I'm not a religious man, I'm not a religious man, I'm a scientist, I'm a doctor, but I want to know that I've done something to make this place better.

I've got to know that, or my life is absolutely meaningless. Well, the ecclesiastes writer says, wake up! What if they didn't die yet?

Listen, if you build the pyramids, you'll be remembered for a while longer than the rest of us. But eventually, if when you die, you rot, and when the sun dies, everything rots, cosmic forgottenness lies at the end of every person's life, it doesn't matter what you've done, it doesn't matter who you are, the same destiny, and that makes everything you do pointless, everything. Now somebody's saying, I know what you're saying, he's saying, oh, I've heard this I had to take philosophy 101, I've heard this sort of thing, this person just being gloomy, I want you to know, you say, that even if you think about that, if you're a practical secularist, you say, of course, if you think about that, you're going to be depressed all the time, but hey, there's Central Park, there's the theater, there's sex, there's incredible restaurants, there's wonderful clothes, and you know what, he's heard this from you, and in verse 7, look, he goes right on, he's heard this, he's heard it a hundred times, he heard people say, oh yeah, sure, it's meaningless if you're going to think philosophically, but let's just, let's go out there and really be normal people, and he goes on, he says, okay, sure, fine.

So, verse 7, go eat your food with gladness, now I don't want to get into my next two sermons here, go eat your food with gladness, drink your wine with a joyful heart, be clothed with white, good food, parties, look great, feel marvelous, okay, see, enjoy life with your wife, have sex all the days of this meaningless life, he says, listen, it's meaningless anyway, it's going to keep breaking through, it doesn't matter, you see, he's really saying, don't you dare tune this out, all the great ones are like this, Buddha, Sidhartha, before his became Buddha, before he became the old story that he was raised in a palace and he hadn't really seen suffering, when he finally went out, the first day he saw an old man, and the second day he saw a sick man, and the third day he saw a dead man, and he realized this was coming to everybody, and the way the legend goes, at one point, he turns to his charioteer, he turns to his servant, and he says, the hearts of men must be hard to be self composed before such a situation, he starts to cry out, he says, old age, well the charioteer says, well of course old age, I mean everybody knows, you lose all your beauty eventually, you lose all your memory, you lose all your sensation, you lose even, everybody knows this, but see Buddha says, you know this and you're not crying out, you're not wrestling with you, doesn't this make everything meaningless, we have to do something, we have to come to grips with it, see the great ones always say that, the great ones refuse to tune it out, what do you do with the evening news, I know what I tend to do, another bomb, you know it's on, another bomb, a flood, okay kids, dinner's on the table, turn off the news, you tune it out, please ask this writer says, don't you dare, you want to lose what little humanity you have left, now he refuses to have you, let you out from under the question, the question of injustices, injustice in this world, and especially the ultimate injustice of radical and cosmic nothingness and forgottenness, makes every single thing meaningless, everything pointless, everything vanity, but in this text we also have, and we're going to be looking at this more in the next three weeks, in this text we also have the clues to two, the two biblical answers, to this question of injustice, now what I mean by that is, the Bible says don't tune out injustice but don't go into despair, there's a third way, don't tune out injustice but don't go into despair, there's a third way, you may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger brother, in fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who try to earn his love by being good, in his book the prodigal god Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental older brother, and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal extravagant grace, whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith, the prodigal god will help you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way, the prodigal god is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the hope and joy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the world. Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash give, that's gospelandlife.com slash give. Now here's Dr.

Keller with the rest of today's teaching. What is that third way? Over the years it seems like increasingly I've found that the Bible's answer boils down to two and I'm going to call them a cool answer and a hot answer.

One is an answer for the mind, that's the cool one and one is an answer for the heart, that's the hot one, all by themselves they don't work but together they're remarkable and the Ecclesiastes writer because he's Ecclesiastes because he's different than any other book in the Bible does not tell you but clue you. He does not let see the Ecclesiastes is not a lecture, it's a seminar. It's almost a bull session.

He does, he goes you, he role plays, he pushes you with questions, he gives you clues and here the clues to both the cool and the hot answer. I will be brief but here's what I want to tell you, even though I'm going to be brief, when we go through the cool answer right now I want you to be patient. If you are not suffering the cool answer is very interesting but if you're suffering the cool answer is very inadequate.

Okay but you have to have them both. What's the cool answer? Alright, the cool or the answer, actually it's not called cool, let's call it the answer for the mind.

He gets at that in verses three and four, in verse four he says something terrible about dogs and my wife is a dog lover and I promised her that I would not, I would put this into context, but in verse four he says it's better to be a live dog than a dead lion. Now when you think of dogs you think of beagles and collies but when the ancient people thought of dogs they did not because the ancient people, dogs were the lowest form of animal, dogs were the scavengers, dogs were wild, dogs lived on garbage and dogs ate cadavers, I mean when Jezebel the great queen, the evil queen Jezebel is thrown into the street back in the Old Testament, what happens? The dogs come into her, you see because well because of course she deserves the dogs they say because she is so evil and the dogs deserve her you see because they're so they're so low but the lion out of the ancients the lion was the greatest noble beast just as we see him now and now listen what is he saying in verse four astounding.

In fact if it wasn't linked with verse five we would have to back away what he says in verse four is fairly simple he says there it's better to be a liar a murderer a scavenger and save your skin than be a noble person who dies it's not worth it to live for anything anymore what he's really saying you say what is he saying yes he's saying something so shocking and so vicious he says it no longer matters it's better to save your skin be a liar and a murderer and a thief then it is to be a noble person and die for it and if you say he is he saying that it's in verse five the word four you see the word four this is the reason four and go down in there and he says because love or hate in the end they vanish and what he's saying is something very very very up to date and the philosophers are saying it now and what is it what they are saying is this if this life is all there is if when you die you're rot if we're just we just accidentally evolved as the out of the collocation of accidental forces then there is no such thing as they're right and wrong there can't be all moral distinctions are pointless why well Alistair McIntyre great philosopher has done this very very well in a couple of his books he says here's the reason why he says the there's no such thing as abstract goodness goodness is always relative to purpose what if you somebody gave you a watch and you'd never seen a watch before in your life this is McIntyre's illustration but somebody gave you a watch and you'd never seen this watch watch before and somebody says is it good you'd say I don't know what is it for there's no such thing as abstract goodness is it is the watch for hammering a nail it's bad is the watch for you know you know what is the watch for until you know what something is for you don't know what is good or bad things are only good or bad in relation to the purpose what makes a good human being McIntyre says if we're accidents if there's no purpose then it's ridiculous to say it's bad to hurt people you're just here to survive the strong eat the weak you're just here to survive better to be a live dog better to trample on people I mean what how dare you say who who are you to say there's no warrant to say that anything is good or bad if this life as all there is there is no good or bad but now here's the other part of this weird argument in verse three in spite of the fact that he says vanity meaningless it's all meaningless it's all meaningless up in verse three he says but men are evil and this is the problem Derek Kiddner one of my favorite commentators on this verse Derek Kiddner says something extremely interesting he says what we may not notice about verse three at first is that this sense of outrage is just as much a fact about us as is our mortality the fascination of this book of Ecclesiastes throughout its length arises largely from the collisions of observation and equally obstinate and opposed intuitions so it pushes us toward a synthesis that is largely beyond its own pages is what he means if you don't believe if you believe this life is all there is then there's no such thing as injustice right and yet deep inside you know there is on the one hand he says vanity meaningless pointless but then he also says and yet it's still as evil and there is an incredible contradiction in the heart of being a secular person at the heart of unbelief says this I don't believe really in a God because of the injustice but if there is no God there's no basis for being outraged put it I'll go put it to you two ways it'll be on tape so you can always listen to it again if there's a God evil is a problem it's a big problem he's got reasons for why he's allowing it and we don't know what they are but that's not that really hurts it still doesn't really make it better if there's a God evil is a problem but if even if evil is a problem for you there must be a God you see that if evil is a problem if you are outraged and yet your own worldview gives you no basis for the outrage what it means is your worldview is wrong if you know there's an injustice even though if there is no God there shouldn't be an injustice then you know there's a God put it another way it's a problem for belief evil is a problem for belief but it's a bigger problem for unbelief it's what it's a problem if you believe in God but it's a bigger problem if you don't believe in God because if you don't believe in God then the main the original reason for disbelieving in God is gone you can't even define injustice there's no basis for it that's the cool argument it's a very strong argument it's being made by Christian philosophers all the time and that is evil is a problem for belief but it's a bigger problem for unbelief and that's your only two alternatives so why not believe you have no basis for outrage no basis for against injustice unless there is a just judge we don't know why he's not acting but if you get rid of him out of your mental furniture you got a bigger problem than if you keep him now didn't I warn you if you're not suffering if you're kind of intellectual type and there's lots of you out there like that I know that's intriguing that's interesting you never thought of that that's helpful maybe even but if you're suffering right now it's just cold it's cold comfort there's a place in C. S. Lewis's book a grief observed where he says the thing I'm afraid of and when his wife died Joy Davidman Gresham who went to Hunter College by the way when his wife died he says the thing I'm not so much afraid of is that there is no God I'm afraid of who he might be I'm afraid of meeting a God that I don't like Christianity doesn't just give you one one answer the one answer is there we just gave it to you lots of religions have it there is a God if there is no God you have a bigger problem with evil than if you don't have a God but Christianity gives you another one it's the hot answer it's the personal answer it's the answer for the heart and what is it well the clues for you're in this last little vignette what a weird story when he says I saw one more thing and it impressed me in Hebrew that's that's a two-week a word the word impress means it amazed me it confounded me it mystified me I don't know what it means and here's why he saw a kind of wisdom in this little story this little thing he saw I saw kind of wisdom beyond any wisdom he knew there was once a small city with only a few people in it and a powerful king came against it surrounded it and built huge seed works against it and now they lived in that city a man poor but wise he saved the city by his wisdom but nobody remembered that poor man but the poor man's wisdom was despised there's three things about this wisdom he'd never seen before first of all it was a saving wisdom look at a little city few people versus a great king huge seed works it was absolutely overwhelming the city was absolutely doomed there was no way out we don't know exactly how he did it but there was a wisdom that was so incredibly powerful that it was able to save that city that's incredible but that's not all more than that secondly it wasn't just a saving wisdom it was a serving wisdom one of the things that is so weird and so unusual about this at least in the Old Testament is the wise man is poor now you know the Ecclesiastes is a wise man and if you read the whole book you'll see he's a king you'll see that he's rich because frankly if you're really wise if you're really smart of course you're gonna get up in the world of course you're gonna make some money of course you're gonna get ahead how could a wise man be poor but suddenly he's confronted with the fact that this wisest of men this person with with with a most a supernatural saving wisdom has not used his wisdom to dominate or get up but to be a servant he's used it in a humble way and then lastly the most astounding thing of all anybody who has that kind of power and wisdom and that kind of form of serving serving hood and wisdom he was not just forgotten look he says nobody remembered him but he says he was despised it was a vicious it was a deliberate forgetting the people turned on him they hated him now my friend Sinclair Ferguson wrote a book on Ecclesiastes some years ago he called it pundits folly because he uses the term pundit for the Ecclesiastes and this is what he says he says God has pointed had placed testimonies to his presence throughout our lives there is no safe haven there's no place we can escape his reality and the words of Ecclesiastes 9 13 to 16 read almost like a prophecy whose name most naturally comes to mind when we hear of a poor man full of wisdom who became a savior but whose life and teaching were rejected the man the pundit saw was just a reflection of a wisdom beyond philosophical arguments wisdom himself the true poor wise man who had become the savior as Paul describes him Christ crucified was a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Greeks but to those whom Jesus who Christ is called both Jew and Greek Christ the wisdom of God and the power of God now here's why this is the this is the hot answer and this is a clue the Ecclesiastes writer sees a kind of wisdom and he's moved by it and we know why because it's just an echo a pattern of the great wisdom and this is this we do not just have a God who's simply up in heaven and he says I've got reasons why I'm not dealing with evil you're just going to have to accept them they're and that and that's all you've got that's all you've got you're in more shape if you reject me so there you are you're stuck with me tough is that what God says not the Christian God the Christian God has done something unbelievable here's the gospel we've forgotten God it is he who has made us but not and not we ourselves we've forgotten him that means we go our own way we we doff our hats to him but in general every day we don't remember him we forget him we act as if we're our own gods and because we have turned away from the only permanent thing we have stopped because we've become temporary because we've turned away from the only thing that lasts forever we are going to be forgotten and we know it and deep in our hearts we know it that Ecclesiastes writer and Buddha and all the great ones are trying to push you to say look at it you know the worst thing in the world is to be forgotten to have people forget you to have people forget who you are that people forget that you were coming I mean even in the micro that's horrible but in the macro it's even worse and here we're told we deeply inside know that what's coming is cosmic forgottenness cosmic nothingness and we can't handle it but God has done something about it he sent his son into the world and on the cross he did not give us a philosophical argument when he was on the cross which is the why is the wisdom of God when he was on the cross he did not say let me explain to you why if unbelief has more of a problem with suffering than belief no what he said is my god my god why have you forgotten me what was happening on the cross was God was pouring out the for the cosmic forgottenness he was turning his back on his son he was giving to him what we deserve and what we know is coming in what what is making our lives meaningless even though it's only half conscious even though it's unconscious he got forsaken by his friends forsaken by his enemies but even forsaken by the father he got the cosmic forgottenness that the ecclesiastist writer says is coming to everybody you know it's coming to everybody and it's makes your life meaningless but it went into the heart of Jesus that poor man was forgotten so that you will not be why do you think God can say and I say 49 can a woman forget the baby that nurses had her breasts yay she may forget but I will not forget you behold you are engraved on the palm of my hands how can he say he'll never forget you he'll never ever ever forget you that you will be remembered in love forever and ever how can you walk out of the world knowing that that cosmic forgottenness is not yours anymore and therefore you can walk out in the world and truly finally enjoy what's there because the your forgottenness was put on Jesus and therefore the Christian can sing and though I am despised for God yet God my God forgets me not and he is safe and must succeed for who Christ promises to plead if you are not a believer today but you're a surcher I beg you you've got a hot and a cold answer you not only have to think it out but you have to get to know this one this person a God who came into suffering and received the suffering and injustice of this world in a more deep way than anybody else has ever experienced it if you're a Christian let me tell you what your problem is today you know what your problem is I'll tell you what it is you've forgotten the poor man some of you are here today and you're upset you know what you've forgotten the one who died for you though you forgot him bless the Lord of my soul says the Psalmist and all that is within me bless his holy name bless the Lord of my soul and forget not his benefits the Psalmist gets up every day and says my big problem is I've forgotten what he's done for me I've forgotten the forgottenness that he took upon me if you're here today for example and you feel rejected by somebody and you're in despair you've forgotten the fact that the only person whose opinion counts the only one who's permanent the only one whose love will last forever loves you now because your forgottenness was thrown on Jesus if you're a Christian today your whole problem is your main problem is you've forgotten the poor man you've despised him you need to fill your heart again with the knowledge of what he did for you don't you see this remember the poor man and you'll live forever remember the poor man and you'll be loved forever let's pray we thank you Lord God that because of who you made your son the son of God who loved you forever and knew you forever and then what you did to him you poured out our forgottenness on him because of that we can know that you will never forget us Lord when it comes down to it philosophy can bring us to the brink can even give us some intellectual answers but it's only a knowledge of your son that can help us to move out into the world and deal with the suffering in a way that is neither tuning it out nor falling into despair oh we thank you that only at the cross do we get to the place do we get the resources for dealing with the injustice of life we pray Lord that those of us who are experiencing injustice now would know what your son experienced for us that we can forgive and we can be strong and I pray for those here who don't know who he is yet that through the despair that they might be feeling which is really a gift of your Holy Spirit they may come to see who he is and what he's done for them I pray this in Jesus name amen thanks for listening to today's teaching it's our prayer that you were encouraged by it and that it helped you apply the gospel to your life and share

”车夫回答说：“当然了，这是众所周知的，你总有一天会失去所有的美丽、记忆和感觉。”佛陀说：你们都知道这些，但你们不哭泣，不与自己抗争，这难道不是一切的虚空吗？我们必须要面对它。伟大的人们总是这样做的，他们不会忽视这一点。

那么，你怎么应对晚间新闻呢？我知道我通常的做法是：又一个炸弹爆炸了，你知道的，又是一个炸弹；一场洪水来了，孩子们，晚餐已经准备好了，请关掉电视。你选择忽略它。这位作者说：不要这样做！

你不想失去最后一点人性吗？他不让你逃避这个问题——这个世界中的不公，尤其是终极的不公正和宇宙性的遗忘，使一切变得毫无意义、毫无价值、毫无意义。但在这一段经文中，我们也有两个圣经的答案来应对这些问题，在接下来三周里我们将更深入地探讨这两个答案。我的意思是，圣经说不要忽视不公，但也不要绝望；有第三条路：不要忽视不公，但也不要绝望；有第三条路。

Keller 和今天其他教导的内容。那第三条路是什么？多年来，我发现圣经的答案似乎归结为两点，我分别称之为“冷答案”和“热答案”。一个是头脑的答案，这就是“冷答案”，另一个是心灵的答案，这就是“热答案”。

它们各自单独存在时并不能解决问题，但结合起来却非常惊人。《传道书》的作者之所以被称为《传道书》，是因为它与其他任何一本书都不同。这本书不告诉你答案，而是给你提示。它不是一堂讲座，而是一场研讨会，几乎就像是辩论会。

他引导你、扮演角色、用问题来挑战你，并给出线索，这些线索指向“冷答案”和“热答案”。我将简短地讲一下，尽管我会简短，但我要告诉你的是，在我们讨论“冷答案”的时候，请耐心一些。如果你没有经历痛苦，“冷答案”会非常有趣；但如果你正在经历痛苦，“冷答案”则显得非常不足。但是你必须两者兼备。

“冷答案”是什么？好的，这个“冷答案”，实际上并不是叫它“冷”，我们可以称之为头脑的答案。他在三、四节中提到这一点，在第四节里他说了一些关于狗的可怕的话，我妻子是狗迷，我曾承诺会把这段话放在上下文中来理解。但在第四节里他却说宁可做一只活狗也不愿做一头死狮子。

当你想到狗时，你会想到比格犬和柯利牧羊犬，但古代的人们可不是这样想的。因为在古人的观念中，狗是最卑下的动物，它们是拾荒者，是野兽，生活在垃圾堆里，吃腐尸。想想《旧约》中的那个恶毒的王后耶洗别吧，当她被扔到街上时，发生了什么？狗围了上来，因为当然，人们认为她罪有应得，因为她太邪恶了；而狗也配得上她的遭遇，因为它们的地位实在太低贱了。

但在古人看来，狮子却是最伟大的高贵之兽，就像我们现在看到的那样。现在听我说，在第四节里他到底说了什么，真是令人惊讶。事实上，如果我们不联系第五节经文的话，第四节的内容我们可能需要重新考虑。他说的话其实很简单：在第四节中，他指出，宁可做一个说谎者、杀人犯或盗贼，保住性命，也不要做一个高尚的人为它而死，因为这样活着已经毫无意义了。

他真正想表达的是：你说他在说什么？是的，他说出了令人震惊和残忍的话——他认为，与其成为一个高尚的人为它而死，不如做一个说谎者、杀人犯或盗贼来保住性命。如果这样说是在第五节，第四节的原因就是这个原因了。你看到这里的“四”这个词了吗？

这就是为什么在第四节中他这么说：因为爱恨到最后都会消失。他说的其实是非常现代的观点，现在的哲学家也在说类似的话。他们说的是什么呢？如果这是一切，如果当你死的时候只是腐烂，如果我们仅仅是偶然地从一系列随机力量中演化而来，那么就没有对与错之分了，所有的道德区分都没有意义。

为什么呢？Alistair McIntyre 这位伟大的哲学家在他的几本书里已经很好地阐述过这一点：他指出，抽象的善并不存在，因为善总是相对于目的而言的。比如有人给你一块表，而你从未见过表，有人问它好不好时，你会说不知道，因为它有什么用呢？没有抽象的善或恶，如果这块表是用来敲钉子的话，那就是坏的；如果是用来做其他用途的话，就是好的。

直到你知道它的用途是什么，才能知道什么是好是坏。事物的好与坏都是相对于目的而言的。那么，什么样的人才算作一个好人呢？McIntyre 说：如果我们只是偶然的存在，没有目的，那么说伤害别人是坏事就显得荒谬了。

你只是要生存下去，强者吃弱者，活得更好就是活狗也比踩人好。也就是说，你怎么敢说如果这就是一切的话，没有什么是对错之分呢？
