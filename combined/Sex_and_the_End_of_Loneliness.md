## 引言与经文诵读 / Introduction and Scripture Reading

Welcome to Gospel in Life. During January, we're inviting our listeners to consider becoming a Gospel in Life monthly partner. Monthly partners are an important part in helping us to plan for how we can be the most effective in reaching people all over the world with the gospel.

For many people, they bring up feelings of guilt and shame, or they seem like a list of rules that are impossible to follow. In today's sermon, Tim Keller shows us how God didn't give us the Ten Commandments to crush us with unattainable moral standards, but to point us to Jesus Christ, the only one who perfectly fulfills God's law. Let me read from 1 Corinthians chapter 6.

And I'm going to read from verses 15 of chapter 6 to chapter 7, verse 5. 1 Corinthians 16, verse 15 to chapter 7, verse 5. Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself?

Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Never. Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body?

For it is said the two will become one flesh, but he who unites himself with the Lord is one with him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body.

Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own. You were bought with a price.

Therefore honor God with your body. Now for the matters you wrote about, it's good for a man not to marry, but since there's much immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband. The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife and likewise the wife to her husband, for the wife's body does not belong to her, but to her husband.

And in the same way the husband's body does not belong to him, but to his wife. Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent and only for a time so that you may devote yourselves perhaps to prayer, but then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. Here ends the reading of God's word.

对许多人来说，它们带来了内疚和羞耻的感觉，或者它们似乎是一份不可能遵守的规则清单。在今天的讲道中，提摩太·凯勒向我们展示了上帝并没有给我们十诫来用无法实现的道德标准压垮我们，而是指向耶稣基督，唯一完美履行上帝律法的人。让我读一下哥林多前书第六章。

我将从第六章第15节读到第七章第5节。哥林多前书第六章第15节到第七章第5节。你们不知道你们的身体是基督的肢体吗？

我岂可将基督的肢体与娼妓联合呢？绝对不可。你们不知道与娼妓联合的人就是与她成为一体吗？

因为经上说，二人要成为一体。但与主联合的，便是与主成为一灵。要逃避淫乱。人所犯的，无论什么罪，都在身体以外；唯有行淫的，是得罪自己的身体。

岂不知你们的身体就是圣灵的殿吗？这圣灵是从神而来，住在你们里头的。并且你们不是自己的人，因为你们是重价买来的。所以要在你们的身体上荣耀神。

论到你们信上所提的事，我说男不近女倒好。但要免淫乱的事，男子当各有自己的妻子；女子也当各有自己的丈夫。丈夫当用合宜之分待妻子；妻子待丈夫也要如此。妻子没有权柄主张自己的身子，乃在丈夫；丈夫也没有权柄主张自己的身子，乃在妻子。

夫妻不可彼此亏负，除非两相情愿，暂时分房，为要专心祷告方可；以后仍要同房，免得撒但趁着你们情不自禁，引诱你们。这里结束了神话语的诵读。

## 基督教激进的性伦理 / Christianity's Radical Sexual Ethic

People have been waiting for this for weeks. They continually say, with that view of sex that you have, they say to me, with that view of sex that you have, I can't wait till you start preaching about it in New York. Listen, the early Romans, when Christianity was first bursting onto the scene, the early Romans were amazed and astounded about Christianity in two particulars.

They were absolutely astonished by two things in particular. One is that Christians were radically generous and the other is they were radically pure. One is, on the one hand, they believed in giving away large proportions of their income to the poor.

And secondly, they believed in no sex outside of marriage. And in those two ways, the Romans thought Christians were extremely strange. And in particular, in the second way, they said, not only is that unhealthy, but it's impossible.

And you can read how the early Romans responded to Christianity and you can see that the generosity and the purity of Christians astonished the Romans. And yet, Christianity won the day. As people finally gave it a hearing, as more and more people experienced it firsthand, Christianity swept the modern world of the time.

Today, I found around New York that when you lay out the Christian faith, the people are astonished about the same things that the Romans were, just as astonished. On the one hand, they're cynical about the first one, the generosity. They say, yeah, I gay, but they're nonplussed by the second one.

And I've had many people say to me, you know, this must be a very strange sectarian thing, this idea of no sex outside of marriage. You evangelical Christians are, you know, a fringe group to believe that. And I always have to point out, wait a minute, wait, wait a minute.

All Protestants, all Roman Catholics, all Orthodox Christians, even Judaism in all of Islam has always taught the same sex ethic. So before you start hanging around my neck the sign loony fringe, you know, think about it. Well, then the second, you know, after I say that for a little bit, then there's a second response and it goes like this.

People will say, all right, all right, but times have changed. Wise up, get with it. It's time for Christianity to change with the times and with society.

So why don't you? Why don't you? Does that sound logical?

When Christians first burst onto the scene, they were more out of step than they were than they are today. Why didn't they change? I'll tell you why they didn't change back then, because you see this unique understanding of purity was one of the sources of its power and one of the sources of its appeal, because it did sweep the society.

And besides that, if somebody says, why don't you change? If I say, oh yeah, okay, let's change. That proves what some people thought all along, and that is that Christianity is my idea.

And that it's all right for me to change it when I decide it's time to change it. The real question is, what is it that God says about sex? And also, what is the concept of sex that is embedded in the heart of Christianity that was part of its original triumph over the world?

And my goodness, if it could transform Rome, maybe Gasp, it could even transform New York. It's possible. If we look at this text, we see that even though it's a case study, even though it's actually geared to a particular situation, all the principles, the scriptural principles, the Christian understanding of sex is there, and you can see it.

Look, first of all, the first thing you see is that Paul is responding to the two other philosophies of sex that were ascendant in the Greco-Roman world of the time. Besides Christianity, there were two other approaches to sex, and this is what they were. On the one hand, there was the platonic view, Plato.

Even today, we've got the word platonic, which has come down to it's to meet sexless relationships. Doesn't that what it means now? But still, there was Plato and the Platonists, and on the other hand, you had the approach of the mystery religions.

Now, for the sake of the sermon, let me greatly oversimplify those two views. On the one hand, Plato said, and the Platonists said, the body is bad, the soul is good. Sex has to do with the body, therefore sex always drags you down, it's always kind of dirty, it pulls you away, and spiritually minded people will have as little to do with it as possible.

And that was the platonic view. And then there was the mystery religions view, and the mystery religions view goes like this. When you get hungry, you eat.

When you get sexy, you sex. Of course, just like food, it's an appetite, and of course an appetite, you know, you have to have some control of your appetite, you can eat too much, and so you have to have some control of your appetite. When you fall in love with somebody, you feel the appetite to have sex, so you do it.

And anything else is repression, it's unhealthy. And those are the two views, the prudes and the pagans. And you see, we've always had them.

We've always had those two, we still have them today, and Paul very, very carefully, and very, very vividly and incisively shows that Christians are neither. You see, on the one hand, against the prudes, let me show you how Christianity has a very different philosophy of sex than the platonic or the prudish one. You see, down in chapter 7, in which Paul's talking about marriage, essentially somebody has said that you could translate verses 1 to 5 in modern English by going like this, go to it.

What it's saying here is that sex inside marriage is not just permitted, but it's commanded. And the idea that God would command something that was tainted in the platonic way is ridiculous. In fact, the Bible's attitude towards sex is almost, in a comical way, extremely forthright and frank.

You know, you've got the Song of Solomon that people have not known what to do about for years, it's right there, it's a whole book of the Bible, nobody ever preaches out of it, and what it is, it's a celebration of sexual love. You can go to places like Proverbs 5.18 and 19 where it commands men to be ravished with their wives' breasts, see. And you know, I thought what was interesting, I was talking to a man that teaches, I think he's retired now, teaches, this is a sidelight but interesting, teaches American history at Yale.

And he said in the 1950s he was doing a study of what the early American Puritans taught about sex. Now one thing he showed me, this man showed me, was that whereas Victorians were repressed about sex, Puritans were not. Puritans were strict about sex, but they were not repressed, because they were quite willing, when they read the Bible they saw the Bible talked about sex in extremely frank terms, very open, happy terms, and as a result the Puritan sermons are very, very graphic.

And when this man tried, he wrote an article about American Puritans' views of sex, he wrote the article and gave it to the Yale Review in the mid-1950s, and the Yale Review would not publish it. And the reason for that was the quotes from the Puritans were too graphic and risque and they felt that it would offend the taste of many of its readers. You know what's going on here, the Puritans' understanding of sex, which was very biblical, was far more liberated, unrepressed, than that of the typical reader of the Yale Review in the 1950s.

But you know, let me tell you this, the Bible goes beyond frankness and even fun when it talks about sex, it goes to glory. In Romans chapter 7, we're told that God relates to us the way a husband relates to a wife, and it says that we put ourselves in God's arms spiritually, and he bears fruit into the world through our body. That's in Romans 7.

And it says married love, it says the sexual act and the reproduction that comes from the sexual act is a picture of God's relationship to us. In the Old Testament, God is constantly saying, I'm the husband and Israel is my bride. In the New Testament, Christ is the bridegroom and the church is the bride.

And let me tell you what this is meaning. Let me tell you what this means. Listen, the Bible says that sex is a model and a foretaste of the ecstasy of knowing him perfectly, that in heaven when we know him face to face, and we enter into a union of love with him and all other people who love him, on that great day, there's going to be a deep delight and a towering joy and a deep security of such nature that the most rapturous sex between a man and a woman is just an echo of it.

It's like bread and water compared to a feast. And that's what the Bible teaches. That goes way beyond frankness, doesn't it?

That goes way beyond fun. Now look, you've got to bear with me here. I'm not from Mars.

I know what it's like. And I know this. I know that for so many of you, you have been whipsawed back and forth between the prude and the pagan, prudish and the paganism.

You were raised probably in an atmosphere that said sex is dangerous and kind of dirty and we don't talk about it. So you're raised with a platonic view, right? And at some point, somebody, somewhere tried to bring you over out into liberation.

And to one degree or another, you became sexually active or maybe got very, very active and you moved out into, you know, into absolute liberation. And yet it hasn't been what you thought. There's been confusion.

There's been pain, right? There's been all kinds of problems. And when the problems show up, the trouble is though you have an intellectually, a liberated mindset, you can't forget all those awful things that your aunts and uncles and grandparents and grand, you know, your parents said.

And so the old statements from your childhood come back to haunt you and you're whipsawed. And it's awfully hard, isn't it? Because of what a mess sex is for us in our lives.

It's awfully hard for us to actually hear what the Bible says about the glory of it. And yet I would hope that at least you understand enough of the joy of sex to realize that this is what the Bible is saying. Don't you see now why the Bible says that sex is for an absolutely permanent and fully committed relationship in which your whole self, mind, will, and emotions is completely committed to someone else?

You see why the Bible says sex has no place outside of a fully committed relationship? Why? Because sex is a model of our relationship with God.

The total love and the total submission of a complete relationship with God, total union with him, and the joy that results from it on that day in which we know him face to face. Will that day be fun? Of course it'll be fun.

And that's why sex is fun, the earthly analogy. But if you understand what the Bible says here about the glory of sex, you can't be a prude or a pagan. Because like a prude, you can't despise sex, but like a pagan, you can't deify it.

Because a Christian knows that sex is a signpost only. And even when you're having guilt-free, wonderful sexual experience with somebody that you're totally committed to, even those of us who have experienced beautiful sex in a beautiful marriage realize, if you read the Bible, that it doesn't actually satisfy the deepest longings for intimacy. Sex is a signpost.

Why do you think there's, you know, remember that, is it Jim Croce, that song that goes, no it's not him. Remember that song that goes, deeper than the oceans, no it goes, Dan Fogelberg. But he sounds a little bit like Jim Croce.

Longer than there have been fishes in the ocean, remember this, it's sort of silly, but let me say it to you, and you'll see the point. Longer than there have been fishes in the ocean, higher than any bird ever flew, longer than there have been stars up in the heaven, I've been in love with you. Now, is that just silly sentimentalism or what?

Why is it there's so many love poems and songs that go to these ridiculous lengths? The reason for it is because real love always is trying to get at eternity. And the best sex never really gets there.

And those of you who think, if I could just have this rapturous relationship with this person, if I could finally get there, I'd be happy, friends, what you'd be doing like is you're coming to a signpost that says, this way to glory, which is what sex is, and you're camping under it and saying, I've finally arrived. And you'll never get anywhere that way. So sex is marvelous, sex is wonderful, and the Bible acts like it, and nobody can quite figure that out.

You know, a Christian who really understands what the Bible says about sex just doesn't blush about it, you see, and it can laugh about it, and you take it very, very seriously. It's demystified, see, it's demystified. But on the other hand, don't forget this side, on the other hand, Paul not only moves against the prudes, he also moves against the pagans.

Up in the couple of verses that we didn't read earlier in the chapter, he says, food is for the stomach and the stomach for food, but God will destroy them both. The body is not meant for immorality, but for the Lord. What do you think he means there?

He is talking about the people that say, hey, food is meant for the stomach and sex is meant for the body, and when you get hungry, you have food, and when you feel sexy, you go and have sex, and what's the big deal? And he's coming against that, and he says, flee sexual immorality. So suddenly, though he's talking about how good and wonderful it is, he says, on the other hand, no, sex is not just an appetite to be satisfied.

You see, for example, what if you go to your doctor, and the doctor says, you know, your trouble is, the way in which you've been eating for the last 30 years, you are about to have a heart attack any minute. You have to radically change what you eat. All these foods that you want, you better not eat them, because if you do, you're going to be, you're going to die.

So the first time you go out to eat, here's a great big steak full of, you know, of all the stuff you're not supposed to have on it. Here's a great big potato full of butter and sour cream, and here's all the things you're not supposed to eat, and you say, I'm going to eat it anyway. So you sit down and you eat it.

You sit down and you eat it. Right away, you say, this is poison. It tastes like poison.

Of course it doesn't taste like poison. It tastes wonderful. It tastes as wonderful as it always tastes, but it is poison.

Your appetite is completely out of accord with what you need. And the Bible says that is really what's happened to sex, and the reason for that is because unlike your body, unlike a hunger, excuse me, unlike your appetite for food, sex is a glorious thing, remember? It gets close to the ultimate reality.

Sex is so, it's a signpost to the ultimate reality, and therefore, when sin disordered it, and who can deny the fact that our selfishness and pride has made us disordered, that we are not what we ought to be. So when the sin came into our lives, it disorders that place in a very, very serious way. Because look, what would you rather deal with?

What would you rather confront, a rabid, crazed, insane horse or a rabid, crazed, insane mouse? You tell me. Well, you say, I mean, they're both equally insane now, which one would you rather deal with?

And you say, well, the horse. Why? Because the greater something is in its essence, the more dangerous it is when it's disordered.

Right? You take the mouse any day, not the horse. And the same way, oh yes, I'm sure there's other appetites that are disordered, but sex, because it's such a great thing, and because it comes so close to the heart of ultimate reality.

The problems that we've experienced there, as Paul says, it's a bad sin in a sense, because it's closer to the body. You sin against yourself, he says in verse 19, you sin in deep. We all chase things like success, true love, or the perfect life, good things that can easily become ultimate things.

When we put our faith in them deep down, we know they can't satisfy our deepest longings. The truth is that we've made lesser gods of good things, things that can't give us what we really need. In his book, Counterfeit Gods, The Empty Promises of Money, Sex, and Power, and the Only Hope That Matters, Tim Keller shows us how a proper understanding of the Bible reveals the truth about societal ideals and our own hearts, and shows us that there is only one God who can wholly satisfy our desires.

This month, we'll send you Counterfeit Gods as our thank you for your gift to help Gospel and Life share the love of Christ with people all over the world. You can request your copy at gospelandlife.com slash give. That's gospelandlife.com slash give.

Now here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching. For example, can you imagine if you came to a country where you were getting to know people and you say, I'm trying to figure out something about the customs of this country, and you find out that when all the young men go away to college, the first thing they do when they get into their college dorm room, and when they finally have freedom from their parents and the eyes of outsiders, first thing they do is they put up these incredibly big, beautiful posters of apple pie, spinach, hot dogs, you know, they look so succulent, they're up close, you know, and they always put water on, when they photograph food, they always put water on it, and then they put the light on it, and then they, what, and they just sit around, they just sit around, and they look at it, and they say, incredible, and they go around each other's rooms and look at them.

What would you say about a country like that? This is serious, almost. What if you went to a place where you found that people paid a lot of money to go into these little clubs, and in the clubs, everybody sat around a stage, and, you know, the lights were low, and there was this bumping and grinding music, you see, and everybody paid a lot of money to come in, and they watched that out in the center, somebody was slowly, bit by bit, pulling, in time to the music, in stages, the cover off of a hamburger, and everybody says, phew, wow, and every night they'd go out and do it, and what you would say is this, either this is a country where the people are starving, starving, who would treat food like that, don't you get, I mean, what's going on?

Either a place where people are starving, or a place where their appetite is severely disordered and out of whack, or both. Now, friends, if somebody came from some other planet where they did not have their entire life and their minds and their sexual appetite disordered by sin, they'd come and they'd wonder the same thing. That's how we act.

And for anybody to say, well, sexual appetite is just like appetite for food, anybody who has an appetite for food the way we have an appetite for sex would be locked up. And the reason for it is because, God says, and Paul says, your sexual appetite does not really work in accord with your nature anymore. And therefore, you can't just do what feels good, any more than that person who is going to die if they eat the steak can eat the steak.

And so Paul says, on the one hand, oh, friends, sex is a marvelous thing, it's a glorious thing, and on the other hand, flee sexual immorality. Don't you see that we've demystified sex? We don't just get scared about it, we don't talk about it in hushed terms, on the other hand, we don't deify it, and we don't think that the sexual impulse that you naturally feel is one of the most noble impulses.

A Christian is not a prude or a pagan. Now, the question comes down to then, okay, if sex is that good, but if sex is that weird, what guidelines have I got if I'm walking through a kind of minefield on the basis of what you said, what guidelines do I have? And Paul gives us the guideline and explains how sex is supposed to function in the life and how, therefore, you can order your life in accord with that design principle.

And he says it right here, he uses a case study, this is what the case study is, he uses prostitution, and he says here in verse 16 and 15, shall I take the members, do you not know, pardon me, shall I take the members of Christ, that's his body, and unite them with a prostitute? Never. Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body, for it is said the two will become one flesh.

Now listen, sex is God's ordained and designed way to say to another human being, I belong completely and exclusively to you. See, Paul doesn't say here, don't go out with a prostitute because you should only have sex with somebody you love. It's degrading to have sex with somebody for money.

He doesn't say that, does he? He says the reason you shouldn't have sex with a prostitute is because anybody you have sex with, you have become one with. Sex is a way to say to somebody else, I belong completely and exclusively to you, and if you use it to say anything else, it's a lie.

It's a nonverbal piece of communication that God designed, and it's meant to carry a message, it's a communication mode, and if you use it in any other context, you destroy its usefulness. Let me give you an example. Do you remember, I came down for effects, so I'll come back.

You remember Star Trek? There was one of the most famous episodes on the old TV series called The Trouble with Tribbles. Any of you remember that?

And in it, there's a man who's a governor of a planet, and he has with him a shipment of quadrotriticale, which is some kind of, remember quadrotriticale? Sure. It's some kind of hybrid grain, and he's afraid somebody is going to steal it, so he wants a starship to guard it.

That's right. So he puts out a priority one distress signal. He pushes a button, and out it goes across the galaxy, and all the starships come, and they say, what's going on?

Because a starship knows that a priority one distress call always means, what, you Trekkies, you remember what it means? It means invasion, or nothing less than that. It means some kind of incredible galactic catastrophe.

And they show up, and the governor says, well, the reason I called you is I want somebody to watch my grain. And I knew that if I pushed that number, you know, priority one distress call, that you would certainly come. And, you know, the officers of the starship Enterprise look at him and say, listen, do you realize that that is illegal?

Do you realize why that's so bad? Because if you begin to use a nonverbal signal that means something like this to mean something else, you destroy its ability to be used. It becomes meaningless.

It becomes useless, right? Because who will know what it means? Same principle.

God said, sex is a way to give yourself totally to somebody else and to say, I belong completely and totally and exclusively to you. Now, listen, that's the reason why the Bible says adultery, thou shalt not commit adultery. Of course, it means that if you're married to somebody else, you shouldn't have sex with someone else to whom you're not married.

But adultery in the Bible really means no sex outside of a marriage covenant. What is a covenant? A covenant is a life commitment.

It's a personal life commitment. And here, let me tell you what it is. And here, let me tell you what it is.

A marriage covenant is coming to somebody else that you want to marry and saying this. A Christian comes into marriage like this. This is the wrong person.

Any Christian who comes into marriage with a biblical mindset comes in and says, I know this is the wrong person for me. Now, I'm exaggerating a little bit, of course. But the point is, a Christian comes in and says, this person's a sinner and I'm a sinner.

This person tends to be selfish and I tend to be selfish. That's the nature of our hearts. And therefore, there is no way that I will ever get married to somebody who's compatible to me.

I'm going to find someone who's fairly compatible, but there's no such thing as a person who's completely compatible. Not only that, that person is going to change and I'm going to change. Therefore, in a marriage covenant, you're doing this.

You give yourself to a personal identity in the face of an uncertain future. You say, I'm going to be your spouse no matter what happens. You see, modern culture says, define yourself, define your identity in terms of your present needs, which means today I can say because of my needs, I am your spouse, but tomorrow because of my needs, I'm not.

And Christianity says, no, you do not define your identity in terms of your present needs. You define your identity in terms of your past commitments. You come to that person and you say, I am your spouse and I will be your spouse because in spite of all the uncertainty of the future, I make a vow that creates a place of security so that you have the freedom, so that you have the power to make yourself vulnerable to me.

By my vow, I create a place of security so it's safe for you to be totally vulnerable and naked to me. That is what a marriage covenant is. The Bible says marriage is like a gem tumbler.

You know what a gem tumbler is? You put two diamonds that are all rough into a gem tumbler and the tumbler moves them around and they are constantly put into conflict with each other and they slowly, bit by bit by bit by bit, do what? They knock all the rough edges off of each other until they become two beautiful, smooth stones.

The marriage covenant is the walls of the tumbler. If it wasn't for the walls of the tumbler, the first one or two conflicts and the gems would just go away from each other and never come back. But the tumbler keeps them back into this creative conflict, you see.

But the gems, I was told by somebody who knew about this, the gems will crack and break unless you put compound in there. And the compound in marriage is sex. Because in sex you're saying to somebody else, I belong completely and exclusively to you.

You make yourself totally vulnerable and what it does, it's a cement that continually re-strengthens your covenant, your commitment, your life covenant. Sex in marriage is a unitive act in which you say, I belong to you. Every part of me is you, you see, totally.

Totally. And if you use it in another context, if you use it outside of a covenant, what happens is instead of it actually strengthening your ability to trust yourself and be vulnerable and commit yourself, it destroys your ability to trust yourself to somebody else and be vulnerable. It destroys it.

And I, listen, it's not just what the Bible says. I appeal to your own experience. Surely you remember that when you first had sex with somebody when you were not married to them, if that's been your experience.

And I know it has been in plenty of people. How do I know that? Because it's America, because it's New York, because I got 200 people here and I know it has been your experience.

You remember this. You remember that you felt so given that it felt completely incongruous to have been so given to somebody else and to be so one and then not have that other person have any real obligation to make decisions with you. In other words, there was a unity there and it seemed so incongruous that it didn't just spill out into the rest of your life, right?

The fact is, other person could decide to go anywhere he or she wanted. The fact is, person was not accountable to have unity, social unity with you or economic unity with you or decision making unity with you. But just in this one area had unity.

You felt married and you couldn't be. And that's why Paul says, don't you see when you unite with a prostitute unity in this physical area without unity in every other area is a monstrosity. And everybody, everybody realizes it at first.

But what happens is you begin to harden yourself. And as you begin to harden yourself, it makes it harder and harder for you to feel vulnerable and you lose the ability that sex was there to the role that sex was there to have in your life. And that role was to enable you to more and more trust, more and more commit, more and more make yourself vulnerable.

Instead, what you're doing is you're getting harder and less able to trust people. And that's because sex will work backward outside of a covenant. Don't you see now why I many times in counseling over the years, I would talk to people who are not who are married and they were having trouble with jealousy.

Whenever I talk to somebody who is having so much trouble with jealousy and trusting the other person in their marriage, I would often say, have you ever betrayed your spouse in the area of sex? And almost inevitably they say, yeah. And then you begin to realize why they're having trouble because their trust apparatus or commitment apparatus has been damaged.

It's it's hard. It's tough. Outside of the covenant, it operates backwards inside the covenant.

It makes it more and more possible to entrust yourself to commit yourself to give yourself because that's what sex is. It's God's ordained way to say to somebody else, I belong completely and exclusively to you. Now, how do we apply this to our lives?

You know, here's the doctrine. Here's the teaching. Here's a marvelous concept of sex.

It's not mystified. It's not a pagan or the prudish approach. It's it's the most glorious and lofty possible understanding of sex there is.

You see, it's not repressed at all. Now, the question is, how do we apply it to our lives? And here's what I would just suggest in closing.

This is New York, right? And at this point, I'm just going to really address single people because that's where so many folks are. Number one, one of the reasons why you feel so lonely is because of sex.

On the other hand, one of the reasons that sex was invented was because of loneliness. You know, in the in the back in Genesis, when God had created Adam. God looks at Adam and says, it is not good for man to be alone.

And he creates woman. Sex was originally invented to deal with loneliness. And so it's absolutely natural for you to try to deal with your own loneliness through that.

But let me say that when there's two things you got to keep in mind. Number one, the only real cure for loneliness is the thing that sex points to. And that's intimacy with a father.

And secondly, when you misuse sex, it works backwards. Just always remember that instead of making you less lonely, which is how it's supposed to work, it always makes you more lonely. It always does.

I doubt there's anybody who will deny it is being honest. People tell me this all the time. Number one, remember that sex is only a signpost to what really will fulfill you.

The intimacy you really want. And number two, if you use it improperly, it makes you even more lonely. And one of the reasons for that is because very often sex is part of an idolatry for a single person.

Some single people worship the idea of freedom. They say you might say I'm a Christian, but what you really worship is freedom. You don't want anybody to be possessive.

You don't like commitments. You don't want to have to have somebody else to make decisions with, right? You don't want to have somebody else that you have to be accountable to.

And you never want to be. And as a result of that need for freedom, you have to have sex with people without outside of marriage because you don't want the whole package. But that's only making you more lonely.

On the other hand, there's some people, some singles who worship not freedom, but they're they desperately so desperately want to be married. And they believe that their lives will not ever be whole until they are that they'll use sex as a way to get that. Don't you see, in both cases, God is not your real goal.

It's not the thing you're really worshiping. But independence or dependence, even making marriage into a goal and idol will actually just lead to more idolatry and more loneliness because there's nothing. If you think it's lonely not being married, it's far lonelier being unhappily married.

If you think that life without sex is lonely, it's far lonelier to use sex outside of a covenant. So what are we to do? Go to him.

You know, R. C. Sproul, my old mentor, has this great quote from his book on marriage.

He says, the marriage state is an image of my relationship to God in a profound way. Both my relationship to God and my relationship to my wife involve a covenant structure in which mutual parties are bound to each other by commitment sealed with oaths. Both involve knowing intimacy.

Both create a place where I can be naked and unashamed. In marriage, I enter the most intimate of all human relationships. It involves risk.

But if it's to work, I must be naked. And if I expose myself utterly and discover that my wife has seen all that I am spiritually, emotionally, and physically, and understands who I am and still loves me, then I experience at the human level something of the most deep and profound love of all. God has seen all of me.

In Christ, he accepts me and gives himself to me. You see, what he's saying here is, on the one hand, even the best sex in a marriage covenant where somebody knows you completely. You see, that's the way a covenant is supposed to work.

You're completely exposed to that person. You're totally vulnerable, and the person loves you anyway. R.

C. says, you're experiencing on a human level just a hint of what it's like to know that through Jesus Christ, you are completely received by God. And not only that, God gives himself to you.

You don't just give yourself to God. That's why you can call him my God. And friends, what is somebody saying?

What happens if you have abused it? What happens if you've taken it? And what happens if this morning you can say, I have seen sex work backwards in my life.

Now what do I do? And the answer is to remember Mary Magdalene, to remember people that Jesus Christ just received, no matter what the past was, and said, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, I know. But don't you see, Jesus says, I love you now, and I can heal you, and I will touch you, and I will receive you.

And not only that, I will use you as you are now, even with your past. In fact, because of your past, I can overwhelm the sin in your life. And I can actually make you into something beautiful now that even incorporates all the problems of your past, so that you're not on plan B, you see, so that you're not a sub-Christian, so that you haven't really missed my best for your life.

If you give yourself to me, you will have the best. You are not your own. You are bought with a price.

Therefore, honor God with your body. Let's pray. Thank you for joining us today on the Gospel in Life podcast.

人们等待这个已经好几个星期了。他们不断地对我说，以你对性的看法，我迫不及待地想听你在纽约讲道。听着，早期的罗马人，当基督教首次出现时，早期的罗马人对基督教的两个特点感到惊讶和震惊。

他们对两件特别的事情感到绝对惊讶。其一是基督徒极其慷慨，另一个是他们极其纯洁。一方面，他们相信将大部分收入捐给穷人。

其次，他们相信婚姻之外不可有性行为。在这两方面，罗马人认为基督徒非常奇怪。尤其是在第二方面，他们说，这不仅不健康，而且是不可能的。

你可以阅读早期罗马人对基督教的反应，你会看到基督徒的慷慨和纯洁让罗马人感到惊讶。然而，基督教赢得了胜利。当人们最终听到它时，越来越多的人亲身体验到它，基督教席卷了当时的现代世界。

今天，我发现在纽约，当你阐述基督教信仰时，人们对罗马人感到惊讶的同样事情感到惊讶。一方面，他们对第一点，慷慨，持怀疑态度。他们说，是的，我给，但他们对第二点感到困惑。

我有很多人对我说，你知道，这一定是一个非常奇怪的教派的事情，婚姻之外不可有性行为的想法。你们这些福音派基督徒是，你知道，一个边缘群体才会相信这个。我总是不得不指出，等一下，等等。

所有新教徒，所有罗马天主教徒，所有东正教基督徒，甚至犹太教和所有伊斯兰教都一直教导同样的性伦理。所以在你开始在我脖子上挂上"疯狂边缘"的标志之前，你知道，想想吧。好吧，然后第二个，你知道，在我说了一会儿之后，然后会有第二个回应，是这样的。

人们会说，好吧，好吧，但时代变了。明智点，跟上时代。是时候让基督教随着时代和社会改变了。

那么你们为什么不改变？你们为什么不改变？这听起来合乎逻辑吗？

当基督徒首次出现时，他们比现在更加与时代格格不入。他们为什么不改变？我告诉你他们当时为什么不改变，因为你看，这种独特的纯洁理解是其力量的来源之一，也是其吸引力的来源之一，因为它确实席卷了社会。

而且，如果有人说，你为什么不改变？如果我说，哦，是的，好的，让我们改变。这证明了一些人一直以来的想法，那就是基督教是我的想法。

而且当我决定是时候改变时，我可以随意改变它。真正的问题是，上帝对性说了什么？还有，什么是嵌入在基督教核心的性概念，这是其对世界的原始胜利的一部分？

天哪，如果它能改变罗马，也许，惊讶地说，它甚至可能改变纽约。这是可能的。如果我们看这段经文，我们会看到尽管这是一个案例研究，尽管它实际上是针对特定情况的，但所有的原则，圣经的原则，基督教对性的理解都在那里，你可以看到它。

看，首先，你看到的第一件事是保罗正在回应当时希腊罗马世界中占主导地位的另外两种性哲学。除了基督教，还有另外两种对性的态度，它们是这样的。一方面，有柏拉图的观点，柏拉图。

即使在今天，我们有"柏拉图式"这个词，意思是无性关系。这不是现在的意思吗？但是，仍然有柏拉图和柏拉图主义者，另一方面，你有神秘宗教的方法。

现在，为了讲道的目的，让我大大简化这两种观点。一方面，柏拉图说，柏拉图主义者说，身体是坏的，灵魂是好的。性与身体有关，因此性总是拖累你，总是有点肮脏，它把你拉走，精神上有追求的人会尽可能少地与它打交道。

这就是柏拉图的观点。然后是神秘宗教的观点，神秘宗教的观点是这样的。当你饿了，你就吃。

当你有性欲时，你就做爱。当然，就像食物一样，它是一种欲望，当然是一种欲望，你知道，你必须对你的欲望有一些控制，你可以吃太多，所以你必须对你的欲望有一些控制。当你爱上某人时，你感到有做爱的欲望，所以你就做。

其他任何事情都是压抑，是不健康的。这就是两种观点，禁欲主义者和异教徒。你看，我们一直有它们。

我们一直有这两种，我们今天仍然有它们，保罗非常非常仔细，非常非常生动和深刻地表明基督徒两者都不是。你看，一方面，反对禁欲主义者，让我向你展示基督教对性的哲学与柏拉图式或禁欲主义观点有多么不同。你看，在第七章，保罗在谈论婚姻，基本上有人说你可以用现代英语翻译第1到5节，就是这样，放手去做。

这里说的是，婚姻中的性不仅是被允许的，而且是被命令的。认为上帝会命令某种在柏拉图方式中被玷污的东西的想法是荒谬的。事实上，圣经对性的态度几乎，以一种滑稽的方式，极其坦率和直白。

你知道，你有《雅歌》，多年来人们不知道该怎么办，它就在那里，是圣经的一整本书，没有人讲过它，它是什么，它是对性爱的庆祝。你可以去看箴言5章18和19节，那里命令男人被妻子的乳房迷住，看。你知道，我觉得有趣的是，我在和一个教书的人交谈，我想他现在退休了，教美国历史，在耶鲁。

他说在20世纪50年代，他在研究早期美国清教徒对性的教导。现在他给我看的一件事，这个人给我看的，是尽管维多利亚时代的人在性方面受到压抑，但清教徒却没有。清教徒对性很严格，但他们并没有受到压抑，因为当他们读圣经时，他们很愿意看到圣经以极其坦率的方式，非常开放、愉快的方式谈论性，因此清教徒的讲道非常非常生动。

当这个人试图，他写了一篇关于美国清教徒性观念的文章，他写了这篇文章并在20世纪50年代中期交给《耶鲁评论》，《耶鲁评论》不愿意发表它。原因是清教徒的引文太露骨和冒险，他们觉得这会冒犯许多读者的品味。你知道这里发生了什么，清教徒对性的理解，这是非常符合圣经的，比20世纪50年代《耶鲁评论》的典型读者的理解要自由得多，不受压抑得多。

但你知道，让我告诉你这个，圣经谈论性时超越了坦率甚至乐趣，它达到了荣耀。在罗马书第7章，我们被告知上帝与我们的关系就像丈夫与妻子的关系，它说我们在精神上把自己放在上帝的怀抱中，他通过我们的身体将果实带入世界。这在罗马书第7章。

它说已婚的爱，它说性行为和从性行为而来的生殖是上帝与我们关系的图画。在旧约中，上帝不断地说，我是丈夫，以色列是我的新娘。在新约中，基督是新郎，教会是新娘。

让我告诉你这是什么意思。让我告诉你这意味着什么。听着，圣经说性是完美认识他的狂喜的模型和预尝，当我们在天堂面对面认识他时，我们与他和所有爱他的人进入爱的联合，在那伟大的日子，会有深深的喜悦和高耸的欢乐和深深的安全感，其性质是男女之间最狂喜的性只是它的回声。

它就像面包和水与盛宴相比。这就是圣经的教导。这远远超越了坦率，不是吗？

这远远超越了乐趣。现在看，你必须忍耐我。我不是来自火星。

我知道那是什么样子。我知道这个。我知道对你们很多人来说，你们在禁欲主义者和异教徒之间被来回抽打，禁欲主义和异教主义之间。

你可能是在一个说性是危险的、有点肮脏的、我们不谈论它的氛围中长大的。所以你是以柏拉图式的观点长大的，对吧？在某个时候，某个地方的某个人试图把你带出来进入解放。

在某种程度上，你变得有性行为，或者可能变得非常非常活跃，你进入了，你知道，进入了绝对的解放。然而它并不是你想的那样。有困惑。

有痛苦，对吧？有各种各样的问题。当问题出现时，问题是虽然你在智力上有一个解放的心态，但你无法忘记你的姑姑、叔叔、祖父母、你知道的、你的父母说的所有那些可怕的事情。

所以童年时期的旧说法回来困扰你，你被来回抽打。这很艰难，不是吗？因为性对我们的生活来说是多么混乱。

对我们来说，真正听到圣经对性的荣耀的说法是非常困难的。然而我希望你至少理解足够的性的快乐，以认识到这就是圣经所说的。你现在明白为什么圣经说性是为了一个绝对永久和完全承诺的关系，在这个关系中你的整个自我，思想、意志和情感完全承诺给别人了吗？

你明白为什么圣经说性在完全承诺的关系之外没有位置吗？为什么？因为性是我们与上帝关系的模型。

与上帝完全关系的完全的爱和完全的顺服，与他完全的联合，以及在我们面对面认识他的那一天从中产生的快乐。那一天会有趣吗？当然会有趣。

这就是为什么性是有趣的，地上的类比。但如果你理解圣经在这里对性的荣耀所说的话，你不能成为禁欲主义者或异教徒。因为像禁欲主义者一样，你不能鄙视性，但像异教徒一样，你不能神化它。

因为基督徒知道性只是一个路标。即使当你与你完全承诺的人有无罪、美好的性体验时，即使我们这些在美好的婚姻中经历过美好性生活的人也意识到，如果你读圣经，它实际上并不能满足对亲密的最深切渴望。性是一个路标。

你认为为什么有，你知道，记得那个，是吉姆·克罗齐吗，那首歌是这样的，不，不是他。记得那首歌是这样的，比海洋更深，不，是这样的，丹·福格尔伯格。但他听起来有点像吉姆·克罗齐。

比海洋中有鱼的时间更长，记得这个，有点傻，但让我对你说，你会明白的。比海洋中有鱼的时间更长，比任何鸟飞得更高，比天上有星星的时间更长，我一直爱着你。现在，这只是愚蠢的感伤主义还是什么？

为什么有这么多爱情诗和歌曲达到这些荒谬的程度？原因是因为真正的爱总是试图到达永恒。而最好的性永远不会真正到达那里。

那些认为的人，如果我能与这个人有这种狂喜的关系，如果我最终能到达那里，我会快乐的，朋友们，你所做的就像是你来到一个路标前，上面写着，这条路通往荣耀，这就是性，你在它下面扎营，说，我终于到了。你永远不会以那种方式到达任何地方。所以性是奇妙的，性是美好的，圣经像那样行事，没有人能完全弄明白。

你知道，一个真正理解圣经对性所说的基督徒不会为此脸红，你看，可以笑对它，你非常非常认真地对待它。它被去神秘化了，看，它被去神秘化了。但另一方面，别忘了这一面，另一方面，保罗不仅反对禁欲主义者，他也反对异教徒。

在我们之前没有读的章节的几节经文中，他说，食物是为肚腹，肚腹是为食物，但神要叫这两样都废坏。身子不是为淫乱，乃是为主。你认为他在那里是什么意思？

他在谈论那些说，嘿，食物是为肚腹，性是为身体，当你饿了，你就吃，当你感到性欲时，你就去做爱，有什么大不了的？他在反对这个，他说，要逃避淫乱。所以突然，尽管他在谈论它是多么好和美好，他说，另一方面，不，性不只是一个要被满足的欲望。

你看，例如，如果你去看医生，医生说，你知道，你的问题是，你过去30年的饮食方式，你随时都可能心脏病发作。你必须彻底改变你的饮食。所有这些你想要的食物，你最好不要吃，因为如果你吃了，你就会死。

所以你第一次出去吃饭，这里有一大块牛排，上面全是，你知道的，你不应该吃的所有东西。这里有一个大土豆，上面满是黄油和酸奶油，这里有所有你不应该吃的东西，你说，我还是要吃。所以你坐下来吃。

你坐下来吃。马上，你说，这是毒药。它尝起来像毒药。

当然它尝起来不像毒药。它尝起来很棒。它尝起来和它一直以来一样棒，但它是毒药。

你的欲望完全与你需要的不一致。圣经说这就是性真正发生的事情，原因是因为不像你的身体，不像饥饿，对不起，不像你对食物的欲望，性是一件荣耀的事情，记得吗？它接近终极现实。

性是如此，它是通往终极现实的路标，因此，当罪扰乱它时，谁能否认我们的自私和骄傲使我们变得混乱的事实，我们不是我们应该成为的样子。所以当罪进入我们的生活时，它以一种非常非常严重的方式扰乱了那个地方。因为看，你更愿意对付什么？

你更愿意面对什么，一匹疯狂、癫狂、疯狂的马还是一只疯狂、癫狂、疯狂的老鼠？告诉我。好吧，你说，我的意思是，它们现在都同样疯狂，你更愿意对付哪一个？

你说，嗯，老鼠。为什么？因为某样东西在其本质上越伟大，当它被扰乱时就越危险。

对吧？你任何时候都选老鼠，而不是马。同样地，哦，是的，我确信还有其他被扰乱的欲望，但性，因为它是如此伟大的事物，因为它如此接近终极现实的核心。

我们在那里经历的问题，正如保罗所说，在某种意义上这是一个坏罪，因为它更接近身体。你得罪自己，他在第19节说，你深深地犯罪。我们都追逐成功、真爱或完美生活这样的东西，这些好东西很容易成为终极的东西。

当我们在内心深处对它们有信仰时，我们知道它们不能满足我们最深切的渴望。事实是，我们把好东西变成了次要的神，那些不能给我们真正需要的东西。在他的书《虚假的神，金钱、性和权力的空洞承诺，以及唯一重要的希望》中，提摩太·凯勒向我们展示了对圣经的正确理解如何揭示关于社会理想和我们自己内心的真相，并向我们展示只有一位上帝能够完全满足我们的欲望。

这个月，我们将送给你《虚假的神》作为感谢你的礼物，以帮助《生命中的福音》与全世界的人分享基督的爱。你可以在 gospelinlife.com/give 请求你的副本。那是 gospelinlife.com/give。

现在是凯勒博士今天教导的其余部分。例如，你能想象如果你来到一个国家，你正在了解人们，你说，我试图弄清楚关于这个国家的习俗的一些事情，你发现当所有年轻人去上大学时，他们做的第一件事，当他们进入他们的大学宿舍时，当他们终于摆脱了父母和外人的眼睛时，他们做的第一件事是他们挂起这些令人难以置信的大而美丽的苹果派、菠菜、热狗的海报，你知道，它们看起来如此多汁，它们是近距离的，你知道，当他们拍摄食物时，他们总是在上面放水，然后他们把灯打开，然后他们，什么，他们只是坐在那里，他们只是坐在那里，看着它，他们说，难以置信，他们到彼此的房间去看它们。

你会怎么说这样一个国家？这几乎是严肃的。如果你去一个地方，你发现人们花很多钱去这些小俱乐部，在俱乐部里，每个人都围着一个舞台坐着，你知道，灯光很暗，有这种跳动和研磨的音乐，你看，每个人都花了很多钱进来，他们看着那里，在中心，有人慢慢地，一点一点地，配合着音乐，分阶段地，拉开汉堡包的盖子，每个人都说，哇，哇，每天晚上他们都会出去做这件事，你会说的是，要么这是一个人们饥饿的国家，饥饿，谁会这样对待食物，你不明白吗，我的意思是，发生了什么？

要么是一个人们饥饿的地方，要么是一个他们的欲望严重失调和混乱的地方，或者两者兼而有之。现在，朋友们，如果有人来自其他星球，那里他们没有因罪而使他们的整个生活、思想和性欲望失调，他们会来，他们会想同样的事情。这就是我们的行为方式。

对于任何人说，嗯，性欲就像对食物的欲望一样，任何人对食物的欲望像我们对性的欲望一样的人都会被锁起来。原因是，上帝说，保罗说，你的性欲不再真正符合你的本性。因此，你不能只是做感觉良好的事情，就像那个如果吃牛排就会死的人不能吃牛排一样。

所以保罗说，一方面，哦，朋友们，性是一件奇妙的事情，是一件荣耀的事情，另一方面，要逃避淫乱。你不明白我们已经去神秘化了性吗？我们不只是对它感到害怕，我们不用低沉的语调谈论它，另一方面，我们不神化它，我们不认为你自然感受到的性冲动是最高尚的冲动之一。

基督徒不是禁欲主义者或异教徒。现在，问题归结于，好的，如果性是那么好，但如果性是那么奇怪，根据你所说的，如果我走在一种雷区中，我有什么指导方针？保罗给了我们指导方针，并解释了性应该如何在生活中发挥作用，以及因此，你如何能够根据那个设计原则来安排你的生活。

他在这里说，他使用了一个案例研究，这就是案例研究，他使用了卖淫，他在第16和15节中说，我岂可将肢体，你们不知道，对不起，我岂可将基督的肢体，那是他的身体，与娼妓联合呢？绝对不可。岂不知与娼妓联合的，便是与她成为一体吗？因为主说，二人要成为一体。

现在听着，性是上帝指定和设计的方式，向另一个人说，我完全而专属地属于你。看，保罗在这里没有说，不要去找妓女，因为你应该只与你爱的人发生性关系。与某人为钱发生性关系是有辱人格的。

他没有那样说，是吗？他说你不应该与妓女发生性关系的原因是，因为你与任何人发生性关系，你就与她成为一体了。性是一种向别人说的方式，我完全而专属地属于你，如果你用它来说别的什么，那是一个谎言。

这是上帝设计的非语言交流，它是用来传达信息的，这是一种交流模式，如果你在任何其他语境中使用它，你就破坏了它的用处。让我给你一个例子。你记得吗，我下来是为了效果，所以我会回来。

你记得《星际迷航》吗？在老电视剧中有一个最著名的剧集叫做《麻烦与毛球》。你们有人记得吗？

在其中，有一个人是一个星球的总督，他带着一批四倍小麦，记得四倍小麦吗？当然。这是某种杂交谷物，他害怕有人会偷它，所以他想要一艘星舰来守卫它。

没错。所以他发出了一级紧急求救信号。他按下一个按钮，它就发送到整个银河系，所有的星舰都来了，他们说，发生了什么？

因为一艘星舰知道一级紧急求救呼叫总是意味着，什么，你们这些星际迷，你们记得它意味着什么吗？它意味着入侵，或者不少于那个。它意味着某种令人难以置信的银河灾难。

他们出现了，总督说，嗯，我叫你们来的原因是我想让某人看守我的谷物。我知道如果我按那个号码，你知道，一级紧急求救呼叫，你们肯定会来。你知道，企业号星舰的军官们看着他说，听着，你意识到那是非法的吗？

你意识到为什么那很糟糕吗？因为如果你开始使用一个意味着这样的非语言信号来表示别的东西，你就破坏了它被使用的能力。它变得毫无意义。

它变得无用，对吧？因为谁会知道它是什么意思？同样的原则。

上帝说，性是一种完全给予自己给别人并说的方式，我完全、完整和专属地属于你。现在，听着，这就是为什么圣经说奸淫，你不可奸淫。当然，它的意思是如果你与别人结婚，你不应该与你没有结婚的其他人发生性关系。

但圣经中的奸淫真的意味着婚姻盟约之外不可有性行为。什么是盟约？盟约是一个生命的承诺。

这是一个个人的生命承诺。在这里，让我告诉你那是什么。在这里,让我告诉你那是什么。

婚姻盟约是来到你想要嫁娶的另一个人面前说这个。基督徒像这样进入婚姻。这是错误的人。

任何以圣经心态进入婚姻的基督徒都会进来说，我知道这是错误的人。现在，我当然有点夸张。但关键是，基督徒进来说，这个人是罪人，我也是罪人。

这个人倾向于自私，我也倾向于自私。这是我们心的本性。因此，我永远不可能嫁给一个与我相配的人。

我会找到一个相当相配的人，但没有一个人是完全相配的。不仅如此，那个人会改变，我也会改变。因此，在婚姻盟约中，你在做这个。

你在面对不确定的未来时把自己给予一个个人身份。你说，无论发生什么，我都会是你的配偶。你看，现代文化说，根据你目前的需要定义你自己，定义你的身份，这意味着今天我可以说因为我的需要，我是你的配偶，但明天因为我的需要，我不是。

基督教说，不，你不根据你目前的需要定义你的身份。你根据你过去的承诺定义你的身份。你来到那个人面前说，我是你的配偶，我将是你的配偶，因为尽管未来有所有的不确定性，我立下一个誓言，创造一个安全的地方，这样你就有自由，这样你就有力量让自己对我脆弱。

通过我的誓言，我创造了一个安全的地方，所以你对我完全脆弱和赤裸是安全的。这就是婚姻盟约。圣经说婚姻就像一个宝石滚筒。

你知道什么是宝石滚筒吗？你把两颗粗糙的钻石放进宝石滚筒里，滚筒让它们四处移动，它们不断地彼此冲突，它们慢慢地，一点一点一点一点地，做什么？它们敲掉彼此所有的粗糙边缘，直到它们成为两颗美丽、光滑的宝石。

婚姻盟约是滚筒的墙壁。如果没有滚筒的墙壁，第一次或第二次冲突，宝石就会彼此远离，永远不会回来。但滚筒把它们保持在这种创造性的冲突中，你看。

但我被一个了解这个的人告诉，宝石会裂开和破碎，除非你在那里放入化合物。婚姻中的化合物是性。因为在性中你对别人说，我完全而专属地属于你。

你让自己完全脆弱，它所做的，它是一种水泥，不断地重新加强你的盟约，你的承诺，你的生命盟约。婚姻中的性是一种联合行为，在其中你说，我属于你。我的每一部分都是你的，你看，完全地。

完全地。如果你在另一个语境中使用它,如果你在盟约之外使用它，会发生什么是，它实际上不是加强你信任自己、脆弱和承诺自己的能力，而是破坏你信任自己给别人和脆弱的能力。它破坏它。

我，听着，这不只是圣经所说的。我诉诸你自己的经验。你肯定记得当你第一次与你没有结婚的人发生性关系时，如果那是你的经验。

我知道这在很多人身上确实如此。我怎么知道？因为这是美国，因为这是纽约，因为我这里有200人，我知道这是你的经验。

你记得这个。你记得你感到如此给予，以至于感到完全不协调，如此给予别人，如此合一，然后那个人却没有任何真正的义务与你一起做决定。换句话说，那里有一种合一，但它似乎如此不协调，它没有溢出到你生活的其余部分，对吧？

事实是，另一个人可以决定去任何他或她想去的地方。事实是，那个人没有义务与你有社会合一或经济合一或决策合一。但只是在这一个领域有合一。

你感到已婚，但你不能是。这就是为什么保罗说，你不明白当你与娼妓联合时，在这个身体领域的合一而在其他每个领域没有合一是一个怪物。每个人，每个人起初都意识到这一点。

但发生的事情是你开始使自己变硬。当你开始使自己变硬时，它使你越来越难以感到脆弱，你失去了性在你生活中应有的角色的能力。那个角色是使你越来越信任，越来越承诺，越来越让自己脆弱。

相反，你所做的是你变得更硬，更不能信任人。那是因为性在盟约之外会反向工作。你现在明白为什么我在多年的咨询中，我会与已婚的人交谈，他们在嫉妒方面有问题。

每当我与在婚姻中有如此多嫉妒和信任另一个人的麻烦的人交谈时，我经常会说，你在性的领域背叛过你的配偶吗？几乎不可避免地他们会说，是的。然后你开始意识到他们为什么有麻烦，因为他们的信任装置或承诺装置已经受损。

它很硬。它很艰难。在盟约之外，它反向运作；在盟约之内。

它使得越来越可能信任自己、承诺自己、给予自己，因为这就是性。这是上帝指定的方式，向别人说，我完全而专属地属于你。现在，我们如何将这应用到我们的生活中？

你知道，这是教义。这是教导。这是对性的奇妙概念。

它不是神秘化的。它不是异教徒或禁欲主义的方法。它是对性最荣耀和最崇高可能的理解。

你看，它一点也不受压抑。现在，问题是，我们如何将它应用到我们的生活中？这就是我在结束时要建议的。

这是纽约，对吧？在这一点上，我只是要真正地对单身人士说话，因为那是很多人所在的地方。第一，你感到如此孤独的原因之一是因为性。

另一方面，性被发明的原因之一是因为孤独。你知道，在《创世记》中，当上帝创造了亚当时。上帝看着亚当说，那人独居不好。

他创造了女人。性最初被发明来处理孤独。所以你试图通过那个来处理你自己的孤独是绝对自然的。

但让我说，当有两件事你必须记住。第一，孤独的唯一真正治愈是性所指向的东西。那就是与天父的亲密。

第二，当你误用性时，它反向工作。只要记住，它不是像它应该的那样使你更不孤独，而总是使你更孤独。它总是如此。

我怀疑有任何人会否认它，如果诚实的话。人们一直告诉我这个。第一，记住性只是通往真正会满足你的东西的路标。

你真正想要的亲密。第二，如果你不恰当地使用它，它使你更加孤独。原因之一是因为性往往是单身人士偶像崇拜的一部分。

一些单身人士崇拜自由的想法。他们说你可能说我是基督徒，但你真正崇拜的是自由。你不想让任何人占有欲强。

你不喜欢承诺。你不想有别人必须一起做决定，对吧？你不想有别人你必须对其负责。

你永远不想是。因此，由于对自由的需要，你必须与人在婚姻之外发生性关系，因为你不想要整个包裹。但那只会使你更孤独。

另一方面，有些人，一些单身人士不崇拜自由，而是他们拼命地、如此拼命地想要结婚。他们相信他们的生活永远不会完整，直到他们结婚，他们会使用性作为获得那个的方式。你不明白吗，在这两种情况下，上帝不是你的真正目标。

这不是你真正崇拜的东西。但独立或依赖，甚至把婚姻变成目标和偶像实际上只会导致更多的偶像崇拜和更多的孤独，因为没有什么。如果你认为不结婚是孤独的，那么不幸福地结婚要孤独得多。

如果你认为没有性的生活是孤独的，那么在盟约之外使用性要孤独得多。那么我们该怎么办？去找他。

你知道，R.C.斯普劳尔，我的老导师，在他关于婚姻的书中有这个伟大的引用。

他说，婚姻状态以深刻的方式是我与上帝关系的形象。我与上帝的关系和我与妻子的关系都涉及一个盟约结构，其中双方通过用誓言封印的承诺彼此约束。两者都涉及认识的亲密。

两者都创造一个地方，我可以赤裸而不羞耻。在婚姻中，我进入最亲密的人类关系。它涉及风险。

但如果它要工作，我必须赤裸。如果我完全暴露自己，发现我的妻子已经看到了我的一切，在精神上、情感上和身体上，并理解我是谁，仍然爱我，那么我在人类层面上体验到最深刻和最深远的爱的一些东西。上帝已经看到了我的一切。

在基督里，他接受我并把他自己给我。你看，他在这里说的是，一方面，即使在婚姻盟约中最好的性，在那里有人完全了解你。你看，这就是盟约应该工作的方式。

你对那个人完全暴露。你完全脆弱，那个人仍然爱你。R.C.说，你在人类层面上体验到通过耶稣基督，你被上帝完全接受是什么样子的一点暗示。

不仅如此，上帝把他自己给你。

你不只是把自己给上帝。这就是为什么你可以称他为我的上帝。朋友们，有人在说什么？

如果你滥用了它会发生什么？如果你拿了它会发生什么？如果今天早上你能说，我已经看到性在我的生活中反向工作了，该怎么办？

现在我该怎么办？答案是记住抹大拉的马利亚，记住那些耶稣基督只是接受的人，不管过去是什么，并说，是的，是的，是的，我知道，我知道。但你不明白吗，耶稣说，我现在爱你，我可以医治你，我会触摸你，我会接受你。

不仅如此，我会使用你现在的样子，即使有你的过去。事实上，因为你的过去，我可以压倒你生活中的罪。我实际上可以把你变成现在美丽的东西，甚至包含你过去的所有问题，所以你不是在B计划上，你看，所以你不是一个次等基督徒，所以你没有真正错过我为你生命的最好计划。

如果你把自己给我，你将拥有最好的。你们不是自己的人，因为你们是重价买来的。所以，要在你们的身体上荣耀神。让我们祷告。
