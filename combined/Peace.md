## 平安被打碎时 / When Peace Is Shattered

But here we see the peace of God is not the absence of some thoughts. It's the presence of God himself. The God of peace will be with you.

Christian peace is not expelling negative thoughts. The problem with expelling negative thoughts is what you're really doing there is you're just refusing to face how bad things are. You know, you're not being realistic.

Okay, I'm going to get calm by not facing the facts. Essentially, Christian peace is not that you stop facing the facts, but you get something in your life, a living power that comes into your life that enables you to triumph over those facts, lifts you up over and through them. And it's a sense of being protected.

And, you know, I, you, lots of us have experienced, I think, lots of believers have experienced this peace of God. But in the situations that I have been present as a pastor usually, where I've seen people experience this peace of God that passes, that transcends understanding, that goes beyond anything we can really account for. I've seen some people in horrible situations, tragic situations, in some cases, having faced some violent death of a loved one.

Unlooked for. That's just the worst kind of situation to be in. And ordinarily, when you're cruising along in life and suddenly somebody who you love is just ripped out of your life, violent.

At that time, you feel unprotected. You feel vulnerable. You feel like exposed.

You feel like you feel ravaged. And yet, sometimes I've seen Christians experience exactly the opposite. They feel, during times like that, protected, like everything.

Somehow, they have a sense that God is with them and everything is going to be okay. They feel protected. They know exactly how bad things are, but they've got something that enables them to triumph over it.

If you've ever been on a coast and seen in a storm and seen the waves come in and hit the rocks, sometimes the waves are so huge that it covers some rock you might be watching. And you say, that's the end of that rock. No way that rock's going to be there.

And when the waves receive, it's received there it is. Hasn't budged an inch. And Paul is like that.

If you read his life, wave after wave, he's beaten, he's stoned, he's flawed, he's shipwrecked. They're after him. They're trying to kill him.

He's betrayed. Wave after wave after wave. And it's a plain historical fact.

He's right. When he said, I have found a way to be completely poised under any circumstances. He's the rock.

All the waves of life could not break him. And he says, this isn't a natural talent. You can learn this.

So that's the character of Christian peace. It's an inner calm and an equal living that comes from that, but also a sense of God's presence and almost a reason transcending sense of his protection. Number one, number two, what then are the disciplines by which you can develop this piece?

Because actually, Paul's giving lots of advice in here, lots of advice on how you can develop this piece and have this piece of God too. And there's three disciplines. And I'll name them thinking, thanking and loving.

I know the third one should be a TH, but I couldn't figure it out. Thinking, thanking and loving. Thinking.

Notice verse eight. He says, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure. Think on these things and the God of peace will be with you.

So the first thing is thinking. And this is really important. Really important.

Let's take a look at the first three of this long list. Think about whatever is true, noble, right. Now that sounds pretty general, generic, doesn't it?

Whatever is true, noble, right? But when Paul, this is Paul. And when Paul uses these words, these particular Greek words in the Pauline corpus and his writings, he's talking about doctrine.

He's talking about the teaching of the Bible about God, about sin, and about Christ, and about salvation, and about the world and human nature and God's plans for the world and the plan of salvation. That's what he's talking about. And this is amazing.

He's saying, if you want peace, think about doctrine. Think about what you know, about life and about God and about, and this is so completely different than what you're going to find if you walk into a Barnes and Noble Reborder's bookstore and you go to the place on anxiety, worry, stress, dealing with stress, how to relax. And you get out of book, and here's what the woman never do.

Never. None of these books will ever say, so you're stressed, your own hat, anxious. Let's start by asking the big questions.

What is the meaning of life? What are you really here for? What's your life all about?

Where have you come from and where are you going? I mean, what should human beings spend their time doing? Never.

You think that's going to relieve stress to a modern New Yorker? Of course not. Why?

Here's why they go right to technique. They never ask you to think. They never say, let's think about the big questions, you know, what's they fall about?

Let's put things in perspective. Never. They go to techniques.

They go to relaxation techniques. They go to work, rest balance. For example, they'll say, look, a couple times, every quarter, go somewhere, sit on a beach, look at the surf, and just bracket out and stop worrying about thinking about everything else.

Just, or they'll give you thought control techniques about dealing with negative thoughts, the negative emotions, guilt thoughts, and so forth. They will never tell you to think. They'll tell you to actually they go right to technique.

Here's why. Let me read you two. You don't want to worry, I'm going for a second, but let me read you two interesting quotes.

Here's Charles Darwin. And Charles Darwin said quote, a person who has no assured belief in the existence of a personal God and no belief in a future existence with retribution or reward. Such a person can have for his rule of life as far as I see, only to follow whatever impulses and instincts are the strongest or whatever seems to him to be the best ones.

Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. You know, great Supreme Court justice. Quite a formidable intellectual in the early 20th century.

And one of his personal correspondents, he once wrote this to a friend. He says, there is no reason for attributing to a man a significance different in kind from that which belongs to a baboon or a grain of sand. The world has produced me and the reddle snake, but I will kill it if I get the chance.

And the only reason is because it is incongruous to the world I want. The world everyone is trying to make according to one's own power. Now, by the way, Oliver Wendell Holmes got a lot of heat for this.

He's a Supreme Court justice. And he says, you know, there is no rational reason to say that human being is really more valuable, more significant than an animal or a rock. Oh my gosh, people have gone, but you know what, his biographers have said, you know, he's just working out the implications.

If you don't believe in God, this is what Darwin is saying. I think you don't believe in God. And you believe you're here by accident.

And when you die, you rot, that's it. And when the sun dies, everything goes away. And therefore, nothing that human beings have ever tried to accomplish will mount anything.

Okay, what are the implications of that? One of them is there is no right and wrong. You may feel there's right and wrong.

这是一种被保护的感觉。你知道吗？我和你们很多人一样，都经历过许多信徒所经历的那种神的平安。但在我作为牧师在场的情况下，通常看到人们体验到那种超乎理解、无法解释的神的平安时，尤其是在面对一些可怕的情况——有人遭遇了心爱的人的暴力死亡等情况下，我看到了一些人。

这些情况是突如其来的，是最糟糕的情况之一。当你平时生活顺利，突然你所爱的人被无情夺走时，你会感到无助、脆弱和暴露无遗，甚至觉得被摧毁了。然而，有时候我会看到基督徒在这样的时刻体验到完全相反的感觉。他们感觉到，在那种时候，自己受到了保护，仿佛一切都在掌控之中。

他们有一种感觉，知道神与他们同在，一切都会好起来的。尽管他们清楚事情有多糟糕，但有某种力量使他们能够克服这一切。如果你曾经站在海岸边，在暴风雨中看到海浪拍打岩石，有时巨浪会将你注视的那块岩石完全覆盖。你会想，这块岩石完了。

没有可能它还会在那里。但是当波浪退去时，你会发现那块岩石依然屹立不倒。保罗就是这样的人。如果你读他的生平经历，一波接一波的挑战——他被打、被石头砸、受苦、遇船难，总有人追杀他，试图要了他的命。

他被背叛了，一波又一波。这些都是历史事实。他说过：“我已经找到了无论在什么情况下都能保持镇定的方法。”他是那块岩石。

所有的生活波涛都不能击垮他。他说，这不是一种自然的才能，而是可以学习得到的。这就是基督徒平安的特点：内心平静、平等的生活，源自于这种平安，并且有一种上帝同在的感觉和几乎超越理智的理解，祂的保护无所不在。### 二、获得和平的三个修炼 首先，其次，那么我们可以通过哪些修炼来培养这种平安呢？

实际上，保罗在这里给出了很多建议，关于如何培养这种平安并拥有上帝赐予的平安。这里有三个修炼：思考、感恩和爱人。我知道第三个应该是"TH"，但我没弄明白。思考、感恩和爱人。

#### 修炼之一：思考基督教教义 思考。注意第八节，他说：“弟兄们，你们要思念那些真善美之事。”神就是和平，与你们同在。所以第一个是思考。

这一点非常重要，非常非常重要。让我们看看这个长长的列表中的前三个：思考那些真实、高尚、正确的事。这听起来很一般，对吧？“真实”、“高尚”、“正确”的事？

但当保罗使用这些词语时，尤其是在他的书信中，他指的是教义——圣经关于上帝、罪、基督、救赎、世界和人类本性以及上帝的计划和拯救计划的教学。这就是他在谈论的内容。这真是太神奇了。他说，如果你想拥有平安，就要思考教义。

思考你所知道的事物，关于生活和上帝的事情。这与你在巴诺书店焦虑、担忧、压力管理书籍中找到的东西完全不同。当你从书中出来时，你会发现这些书永远不会说： 如果你感到紧张、焦虑不安，请先问一些大问题：生命的意义是什么？你真正在这里是为了什么？

你的生活究竟意味着什么？从哪里来，要到哪里去？人应当把时间花在做什么上？不是“不”！

你以为这能缓解现代纽约人的压力吗？当然不能。为什么？因为他们直接转向了技巧。

他们从不让你思考。他们从不说：“让我们想想那些大问题吧。”你知道，生命的意义是什么？让我们换一个角度看这个问题。

从来不会。他们只会转向技巧。他们会转向放松技巧。他们会告诉你工作与休息的平衡。

例如，他们会说：每隔一段时间，比如每季度两三次，去某个地方，坐在海滩上，看着海浪，什么都不想，停止忧虑。或者，他们还会给你一些控制思维的技术来应对消极思想、负面情绪和罪疚感等等。他们永远不会让你思考。他们会直接告诉你使用技巧。

为什么呢？让我读给你们两个有趣的引言： 查尔斯·达尔文曾经说过：“一个没有确信的个人神存在信仰的人，也没有未来报应或奖赏的信仰的人，在他的生活中，他所能遵循的原则，就我看来，只有跟随那些最强烈或者他认为最好的冲动和本能。” 奥利弗·温德尔·霍姆斯 Jr.，你知道，一位伟大的最高法院大法官。20世纪初的一位杰出的思想家。

他曾写信给一个朋友说：“没有理由赋予一个人的意义与一只红蛇或一粒沙子不同。”“世界创造了我和其他生物，但我会在有机会时消灭它。” 原因只是因为这不符合我想让的世界的样子。每个人都在试图按照自己的力量塑造这个世界。

顺便提一下，奥利弗·温德尔·霍姆斯因这些言论受到了不少批评。他是一位最高法院大法官。他说，你知道的，没有理性的理由可以说人比动物或石头更有价值、更意义重大。哦天啊，人们已经走了，但要知道，他的传记作者说，他只是在推演出这些结论。

如果你不相信上帝，这就是达尔文的观点。我认为你就是不相信上帝，并且认为你是偶然出现的。当你去世时，你会腐烂，这就完了。当太阳消亡时，一切都会消失。

因此，人类曾经尝试完成的一切都毫无意义。那么这个观点意味着什么呢？其中一个含义是没有对错之分。你可能觉得有对错。

达尔文说，你可能会有这样的感觉，但你的感觉不应该凌驾于他人的之上。你可以有这种感觉，但实际上并没有对错。根本无法告诉人们他们应该如何生活。霍姆斯是对的。

最终，人类不过是这些力量的产物，终有一天会消逝。那么说什么比动物或石头更有意义呢？你并不是这样。传记作者说，霍姆斯只是在推演出不相信上帝或生命没有目的的结论。

我知道很多纽约人持有同样的信念。很多人也有相同的看法。他们认为没有上帝，事物是偶然出现的。但他们认为这样思考并推演出后果是不吉利的。

好吧，你说得好，让我们不去推演这些后果是不吉利的，但我想让你看看你在做什么。你通过不去思考你的信仰后果来获得内心的平静，而保罗则说基督徒的和平恰恰相反。基督徒的和平来自于思考其后果，思考。那么，什么是真正的和正确的？

## 信靠的操练 / The Practice of Trust

Darwin says, you may have a feeling, but your feeling shouldn't trump anybody else's. You can feel it, but there is no right and wrong. There's really no way to tell people how they ought to live.

Holmes is right. Ultimately, what a human being is is just we've we're the product of these forces and we're going to go away someday and what's to say that, you know, it may feel more significant than an animal or a rock, but you're not. And what the biographers said was Holmes was simply thinking out the implications of not believing there's a God or there's a purpose in life.

Well, I know plenty of New Yorkers that have the same beliefs. Lots of the same people have the same beliefs. That is, they have the same beliefs.

They don't think there's a God. They think things are here by accident. But they would say to think about it like that to work out the implications is morbid.

Okay, look, fine. That's fine to say, let's not think out the implications is morbid, but I want you to see what you're doing. You're getting your peace by not thinking out the implications of your beliefs, whereas Paul is saying Christian peace is exactly the opposite.

Christian peace comes from thinking out the implications, thinking. See, what are the true and the right? What's the Christian doctrine?

God, there's a God and He made us for fellowship with Him and He created a perfect world, you know, a perfect world in which there's no sorrow or disease or death originally. And He wanted to live with us in it and of course it's gone all wrong and we've turned from Him and the world is broken but He's sent His Son into the world to rescue us and He's preparing a new heavens and new earth. We're going to live with Him forever.

Look at your value, look at the fact that the future is secure now. What does that mean? If you're a Christian today and you believe all that doctrine and you're not at peace, you're not thinking.

Isn't that something? You're not thinking. See, there's a stupid piece and then there's a smart piece.

Let me tell you the stupid piece. Stupid pieces. Ho, ho, ho, to the bottle I go, to heal my heart and drown my woe.

Now what's that? A couple, I'm going to pop a cork. I'm going to sit under a tree.

I'm going to look at the surface. I'm not going to think I'm going to bracket out. See, if I think about all the things that are going wrong in life and in the world, I'm just going to bracket it.

I'm not going to think as much. But the Paul is saying, if you're a Christian, you don't bracket out. You bracket in.

You think big, big picture. Everything's going to be okay. You know, if you really believe just the basic Christian truth and you think it and think it and think about it, you're going to get peace.

And if you don't have peace, you're not thinking. There's stupid piece and there's smart piece and Christian's piece is not by making yourself stupid. It's by making yourself as aware of your beliefs as thoughtful as possible.

That's only number one. Because if you first learn the discipline of thinking, then secondly, there's the discipline of thinking. Because see how very important that is in verse six.

Paul says, don't be anxious. Okay, don't be anxious. Fine.

Well, then what should we be doing? But make requests to God with thanksgiving. So thanksgiving is put against anxiety.

But look carefully here. It's a little counterintuitive, isn't it? See, what we would say is you make your request to God and then you get your request and if you get your requests, you think.

I don't know what it says. It says you thank him as you make the request. Well, why should I thank him?

As I'm making the request, John, I want to wait until I see what he's going to do. No. Paul says you're never going to be content unless you make your request.

That means you acknowledge that life is in his hands and you thank him for whatever he's going to do. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God. Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face every situation, including death.

In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365 day devotional, the songs of Jesus, you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start. And if you already spend time in study and prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest emotions and questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with him.

We'll send you Tim and Kathy Keller's devotional is our thanks for your gift to help Gospel and Life share the love of Jesus with more people. Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash give. That's gospelandlife.com slash give.

Now here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching. You're never going to get contentment unless you see this.

Now this is a heading. You might say subheading, underthinking. That's why I put it thinking, then thanking.

But now listen, we already talked about this. God did not make the world to be a world filled with sorrow and death and violence and suffering. But he's got a plan.

He's got a plan to renew it. He's got a plan to get it back. And the plan is put in the abstract in Romans 8, 28, where it says, if you love God, God is working everything together for good in your life.

Absolutely, everything, even the bad things, even the things that he hates, the things that he didn't put into this world. He is going to weave into a plan, a tapestry. He's going to put everything together and he's going to weave it all together for your good and his glory.

That's an abstraction. Here's the concrete. On the day that Jesus Christ was crucified, all of his friends would have looked up and said, I can't believe this.

The good he was doing, the people he was healing, the people's lies he was changing. I can't believe this happened. I can't believe that these charges were trumped up.

I can't believe they're doing this. And you would have said, I can't believe the God could bring anything good out of this. You would have gone home, senders.

Absolutely no way. God could bring anything good out of this. And you were looking straight at the greatest thing God has ever done toward the redemption of the world.

But you couldn't get it into your little brain at the moment as to how that could possibly be. And God is saying that is just the prime example of what I'm doing in everybody's life. Even the terrible things that are happening to you, I'm working out for good.

I'm only saying this because I'm like a little rat and when I push down a bar and I get food, I push it again. So I'll tell you this story again because you always like it. The most vivid example of this for me was when in my early 20s I prayed for a year, oh, there's a girl that I wanted to date and she was breaking up with me.

I was a girl. I was thinking of marrying and she wanted to break up with me. I was all week, all year.

I said, Lord, don't let her break up with me. Of course, it was the wrong girl. Wasn't the one sitting out here looking at me with a grin on her face right now.

But I actually helped God. I mean, I actually did what I could to help God with the prayer because she was that one summer near the very end of the relationship. She was working at a a poke, you know, a resort for the summer in a poke, and I got a job as a short order cook at the same resort.

I was saying, Lord, I'm making this as easy as possible for you. You know, I've asked for this prayer and I'm just, you know, I'm taking the distance down everything. But I look back at it.

什么是基督教教义呢？神啊，有神，祂为我们造就与祂的团契，并且创造了一个没有悲伤、疾病或死亡的完美世界。祂本想与我们同住在这个世界上，当然这一切都出错了，我们背离了祂，这个世界变得破碎不堪，但祂差遣祂的儿子来到世上拯救我们，并预备了一个新的天和新地。我们将永远与祂同在。

看看你的价值，看看未来的保障现在是安全的。这意味着什么？如果你今天是一个基督徒并且相信这些教义却不安宁、不思考，那是什么意思？这不是很荒谬吗？

你不思考。你看，这里有愚蠢的部分和聪明的部分。让我告诉你愚蠢的部分。愚蠢的部分。

嘿，嘿，嘿，我去找酒瓶，用它来治愈我的心灵并淹没我的忧伤。这是什么？一对夫妇，我要开一瓶酒。我要坐在树下。

我只是看看表面的问题，不去想它们，不去思考它们。如果我想起生活中和世界上的所有问题，我会把它们排除在外。但是保罗说，如果你是基督徒，你不应该排除，而要包含进去。你应该从大局出发思考。

一切都会好起来的。如果你真的相信基本的基督教真理，并且反复思考它，你会得到平安。如果没有平安，那说明你没有思考。这里有愚蠢的部分和聪明的部分，基督徒的部分不是让自己变得愚蠢，而是尽可能地意识到自己的信仰并进行深思熟虑。

这只是第一步。因为首先你要学会思考的纪律，然后是进一步的思考纪律。你看第六节是多么重要。#### 修炼之二：带着感恩祈求 保罗说，不要忧虑。

好的，不要忧虑。那么我们应该做什么呢？但要带着感谢向神祈求。所以感恩是对抗焦虑的。

但是请注意这里。这有点反直觉，不是吗？通常我们认为是向神祈求，然后得到请求，如果得到了请求，我们就会想。我不清楚它说了什么。

它说的是你要在祈求的时候感谢他。那我为什么要感谢他呢？约翰，在我祈求的时候，我想等看到他会做什么再感谢。不，保罗说你永远不可能满足，除非你在祈求时就感恩。

**这意味着你要承认生命在他手中，并且为他将要做的每一件事而感谢他。**诗篇可以深刻地影响你与神的关系。即使耶稣也依靠诗篇来面对每一个情况，包括死亡。在提摩太和凯瑟琳·凯勒的《365日灵修》中，你可以找到每天通过诗篇的读经，获得新的圣经洞见。

如果你没有定期灵修的习惯，这本书是一个很好的开始。如果你已经花时间在研读和祷告上，那么阅读并祷告诗篇可以帮助你将最深的情感和问题带到神面前，并发现与他更深层次的亲密关系。我们将会把提摩太和凯瑟琳·凯勒的灵修本作为感谢您的礼物送给您，以帮助福音与生命向更多人分享耶稣的爱。请访问gospelandlife.com/give 获取您的副本。

今天就行动吧！现在是凯勒博士今天的教导继续的部分。你永远无法满足，除非你看到这一点。这是一个标题。

你可以称之为副标题或思考。这就是我为什么把它称为思考然后感谢的原因。但是现在听我说，我们已经讨论过这个问题了。神并没有创造一个充满悲伤、死亡、暴力和苦难的世界。

但他有一个计划。他有一个计划来更新这个世界。他有一个计划让它恢复原貌。这个计划在罗马书8章28节中抽象地描述为：如果你爱神，神会把万事都变成对你有益的。

> 你永远无法满足，除非你看到这一点。> 这是一个标题。你可以称之为副标题或思考。这就是我为什么把它称为思考然后感谢的原因。

当然，一切，即使是坏事，甚至是祂所憎恶的、祂没有放入这个世界的事物。祂都会编织成一个计划，一幅挂毯。祂会把所有的事情都放在一起，为你的益处和祂的荣耀而编织。这是一个抽象的概念。

让我们来看个具体的例子：在耶稣基督被钉十字架的那一天，所有的朋友都会抬头说：“我无法相信这一切。” 祂所做的好事、治愈的人、改变的谎言……我无法相信这会发生。我无法相信这些指控是捏造的。我无法相信他们会这么做。

你们会说：“我无法相信上帝能从这件事中带来任何好处。” 你们会回家，沮丧地说：“绝对不可能，上帝能从这件事中带来任何好处。” 但你们当时正直视着上帝为世界救赎所做的最伟大的事情之一。只是当时你们的小脑袋里根本想不到那怎么可能。

而上帝说的正是我在每个人生活中所做的事情。即使是你正在经历的可怕的事情，我也在为你的好而工作。我之所以这么说，是因为我就像一只小老鼠一样，当按下一个杠杆得到食物后，我会再次按下它。所以我再给你们讲一遍这个故事，因为你们总是喜欢听。

对我来说最生动的例子是在我二十多岁的时候，我祷告了一整年，哦，有一个女孩我想跟她约会，但她却要和我分手。她并不是我要找的那个女孩，而是一个现在正对我微笑的女孩坐在这里。但我实际上帮助了上帝。我是说，我确实通过祈祷做了我能做的事情，因为她就是那个夏天关系结束前的最后一个夏天。

她在一家度假村工作，那是一家“ poke”（我知道这是个度假村），而我也在同一家度假村找到了一份短工厨师的工作。我刚才说，主啊，我已经尽量让你轻松了。你知道的，我为这个祷告已经请求了很久，我只是在尽可能地缩小距离。但当我回顾时。

神对我说：“我的儿子，当我的孩子向我提出请求时，我会给他们所不知道的一切。你相信这一点吗？” 你若相信这一点，就会有平安；你不信，就没有平安。那责任在谁身上？

是神的吗？所以，要怀着感恩的心来表达你的请求。这就是一种思考方式，这是第一个纪律。#### 修炼之三：爱那不变的上帝 如果你这样做，那么思考就是第二个纪律，但爱，爱才是最后一个。

## 思想真实之事 / Thinking on What Is True

God was saying, my son, when a child of mine makes a request. I always give that person what he or she would have asked for if they knew everything I know. Do you believe that?

To the degree you believe that, you're going to have peace. And if you don't believe it, you don't have peace. And whose fault is that?

Is it God's? See, make your request known with Thanksgiving. So there's thinking, that's the first discipline.

And if you do that, then thinking is the second discipline, but loving, loving is the last one. And where do we get that? Well, notice Paul doesn't just say, think on what is true, what is noble, what is right.

And by the way, you know what it says, think about such things? That is, the Greek word there means to drill down. It means to ponder.

It means to not over chew, over meditate. It doesn't just mean think about. It just means, it just means, you know, just continually pound these things into your head.

But see, the first three have more to do with the mind. Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right. But then look, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable, whatever is excellent.

This is attraction. This is love. He says, not enough just to think on the right things.

It's also important to love the right thing. And here we have to go to St. Augustine.

St. Augustine, great Christian thinker, lived in the third and fourth century. He was completely aware, profoundly aware of the problem in Greek philosophy.

And it had been for years. In fact, Paul's referring to it. The great problem is, how can you live a life of contentment?

And the Greek word for that was adorakia. And that's the very word Paul uses twice in 11 and 12. He says, I've learned.

I've got the adorakia. It means to be independent of circumstances. It means to have this poise.

It means to have this power. And not to be upset, devastated, you know, melted down, freaking out over anything. Always poised.

And of course, as you might guess, the philosophers that really worked that out were the Stoics. And what the Stoics taught was, the reason why most people are not able to live, contented, you know, lies of equilibrium, is that they love the wrong things. You should never love success.

If you set your heart on success, even if you get successful, you'll always be anxious. You'll never have peace because you'll be afraid of losing it. And of course, if you don't get it, you'll even be worse.

And you shouldn't set your heart primarily on family. Because even if you get a good family, you'll always be worried about it. You'll always be anxious, you see, for something to go wrong with the family.

And if the something goes wrong with the family, you know, you'll be devastated. So the philosophers were saying, here's the problem. You're loving things that you're not in control of.

And therefore, they said, don't you dare give your heart to anything but your own virtue. That's what the philosopher said. That's what's certain with the Stoics said.

Most of them. Because the virtue is something you can control. You can't control success.

It has so much to do with circumstances. You can't control your family. Things can go wrong with your family.

You can't control this, you can't control that. So don't set your heart on anything you can't control. That's what they said.

And then you will know tranquility. Set your heart only on your own virtue. You can be courageous, you can be have integrity, you can be honest.

Set your heart only on the only thing that should really truly make you content is to know that you are being the person you want to be. That's under your control. Nothing else is.

And Saint Augustine said, you guys have completely missed the boat. If you think that your virtue is under your control, it is not. Listen, if you say, the thing I'm going to live for is success.

And you've set off, yeah, it's not certain you're going to have success. But if you say the thing that matters to me is that I be the person I want to be, to live according to my principles, you know, living according to my virtues. He says, that's every bit is uncertain.

You don't have control over that. You're human being. You're frail.

And if you fail, then you've got nothing. Augustine says, you got it wrong. You shouldn't be loving things out there and you shouldn't be loving anything in here.

And then he said, only love of the immutable can bring tranquility. Only love of the immutable. What's the immutable?

That which cannot change. Your virtue can change. Don't give me this stuff about control.

He says, your problem is that our problem, the reason we don't have pieces, we're loving mutable things, things that circumstances, including our virtue can take away from us. But there's one thing that's immutable that not only can circumstances not take it away from you, but even the worst circumstances in this life only give you more of it. Have you thought about that?

What's the worst circumstances? Violent death. And there's one thing that if you love it supremely, even violent death gives you more of it.

What is it? The presence of God, the beauty of God, the face of God. And that's the reason why Augustine could say this and it was just amazing.

In his confessions, he lays it out. First of all, he says this. In confessions, this is book four.

He says, God alone is the place of peace that cannot be disturbed. And God will not withhold Himself from your love unless you withhold your love from Him. See, there it is.

If you love the immutable, you'll have tranquility. So how can you not love the immutable only if you withhold your love from Him? But if you don't withhold your love from Him, you will not withhold His love from you.

And you might say, and at some point, Augustine being a great writer was hearing an objection. And the objection goes like this. The objection says, well, no, wait a minute.

You're saying I have to love God, but I love a lot of things. I love material comforts. I love people.

I love romance. I love, you know, there's lots of things. I have to love God not these things.

And he says, no, no, no. But you have to say that if you love God supremely, you not only get God the immutable, but you will find that all that what you have been loving in these things was actually in God. He puts it like this.

我们从哪里得到这些呢？请注意，保罗不只是说，思想那些真实、高尚和正确的事物。顺便说一句，你知道那里说的是什么吗？那个希腊词的意思是“深入挖掘”。

它意味着沉思，而不是过度咀嚼或冥想。它不仅仅是思考，而是不断地把这些事情刻在你的脑海里。但你看，前三个更多关乎思维：无论是什么真实、高尚和正确的事物。然后看，什么是可爱的、可敬的、卓越的。

这是吸引，是爱。他说，不只是要思想正确的事情。更重要的是要热爱正确的东西。这里我们不得不提到圣奥古斯丁。

圣奥古斯丁是一位伟大的基督教思想家，在第三和第四世纪生活。他完全意识到希腊哲学中的问题。事实上，保罗也在提及这个问题。最大的问题是：如何过一种满足的生活？

希腊语中这个词是“adorakia”。保罗在11节和12节中两次使用了这个词。他说：“我已经学会了。” 我有了这种独立于环境的能力。

它意味着保持镇定，拥有力量。**这意味着不因任何事情而心烦意乱、崩溃或惊慌失措。**总是保持镇定。当然，正如你们可以猜到的那样，真正研究出这一点的是斯多葛派哲学家。

斯多葛派认为，大多数人无法过上心满意足、平衡的生活的原因是他们爱错了东西。你永远不应该追求成功。如果你一心追求成功，即使你获得了成功，你也总是会焦虑不安，因为你害怕失去它。当然，如果得不到成功，情况就更糟了。

你不应该把主要心思放在家庭上。因为即使有一个好的家庭，你也会一直担心它出问题。你会为家庭中的任何事情感到焦虑。如果家庭真的出了问题，你就会彻底崩溃。

所以哲学家们说，这里的问题在于你在追求那些你无法控制的东西。因此，他们说，你的心思只能放在自己的美德上。这就是哲学家所说的。斯多葛派也这么说。

大多数斯多葛派哲学家都这样认为，因为美德是你能掌控的。你不能掌控成功。它与许多外部条件有关。你也不能掌控家庭，家庭中可能会出问题。

你不能控制这个，不能控制那个。所以不要把心思放在任何你无法掌控的东西上。这就是他们所说的。然后你就会知道宁静。

只把心思放在自己的美德上。你可以勇敢、可以正直、可以诚实。只有真正让你心满意足的是成为你想成为的人。这在你的掌控之中。

其他一切都不在你的掌控之中。圣奥古斯丁说，你们完全错过了重点。如果你认为你的美德在你掌控之中，那就不对了。听我说，如果你说我要追求的成功是成功，那么你不一定能成功。

但如果你说对我来说重要的事情是我成为我想成为的人，按照我的原则生活，遵循我的美德，他说，这同样不确定。这样讲吧，你们明白了吗？你不控制得了那些。你是人，是脆弱的。

如果你失败了，那你什么都没有。奥古斯丁说，你搞错了。你不应该爱外面的东西，也不应该爱里面的东西。然后他又说，只有对不变之物的爱才能带来平静。

只有对不变之物的爱。什么是不变之物？就是不能改变的事物。你的美德可以改变。

别跟我说什么控制。他说，我们的问题是，我们之所以没有完整，是因为我们在爱那些会变的东西，这些东西包括我们的美德都可以被外界夺走。但有一个东西是不变的，而且环境无法夺走它，甚至最糟糕的生活境遇只会让你拥有更多这种东西。你有没有想过这一点？

最糟糕的情况是什么？暴力死亡。如果你对它爱得至高无上，即使暴力死亡也会给你带来更多的这种东西。那是什么？

上帝的存在、上帝的美、上帝的脸庞。这也是为什么奥古斯丁能这么说，并且令人惊叹的原因。在他的《忏悔录》中，他详细阐述了这一点。首先，《忏悔录》第四卷这样说： 他说，唯有上帝是不可扰乱的平静之地。

只要你不拒绝爱祂，祂也不会拒绝爱你。看，就是这里。如果你爱不变之物，你就会有平静。那么，你怎么能不爱不变之物呢？

但如果你不拒绝爱祂，你就不会拒绝祂的爱。你可能会说，在某个时刻，作为一位伟大的作家，奥古斯丁听到了一个反对的声音。这个反对的观点是这样的：你说我必须爱上帝，但我有很多其他的东西我也爱。我喜欢物质上的舒适、喜欢人、喜欢浪漫等等。

我说，我必须只爱上帝而不爱这些。他说，不，不，不。但你必须说，如果你对上帝的爱至高无上，你不仅会得到不变之物——上帝，而且你会发现你在这些东西中所爱的一切其实都在上帝之中。他这样说： 他正在祈祷。

奥古斯丁写道，引述：“当我爱你的时候，我爱的是什么呢？不是身体的美丽，也不是时间中和谐的旋律，不是光明照进我们眼中的光辉，不是悦耳动听的歌声，不是各种歌曲中变化的音调，也不是花朵散发出的香气。” 不是肉体相拥时令人愉悦的身体部位。这些都不是我在爱你的时候所爱的东西。

但我确实爱某种轻柔的旋律、某种香气、某种相拥的感觉，在我爱我的上帝的时候。但这些都是空间无法包含、时间也无法带走的东西。它们是呼吸不能消散的气味，是吃食也不能减少的味道。这就是我在爱你的时候所爱的东西。

这也是获得平静、宁静和平安的最终途径——就是无比地爱他。### 三、和平的秘密：在基督耶稣里 最后，我告诉了你们内心的和平是什么样的，以及获得内心和平的三个步骤，但保罗还提到了一个秘密。所以我们还没有结束，这里就是我们为什么还没有结束的原因。试着回家后去爱那不变的东西吧。

## 平安的秘诀 / The Secret of Peace

He's praying. Augustine writes, quote, what do I love when I love thee? Not the beauty of bodies, nor the fair harmony of time, nor the brightness of the light, so glads into our eyes, nor sweet melodies of varied songs, nor the fragrance, smell of flowers.

Not limbs acceptable to the embracements of the flesh. None of these things I love when I love my God. But and yet I love a kind of light melody, fragrance, meet an embracement when I love my God.

But they are those which space cannot contain, which time cannot bear away. They are smells that breathing cannot disperse. They are taste that eating cannot diminish.

This is what I love when I love my God. And that's the final way to get the calm, to get the tranquility, to get the peace. It's to love him supremely.

Now, finally, I told you character of peace, the three disciplines of peace, but the secret, Paul talks about the secret. And this is why we're not done yet. And here's why we're not done yet.

Try to go home and love the immutable. Just go ahead. And then tell me, you know, write a paper and tell me how it went.

I mean, just go home and sit down, find a nice quiet place, sit down, and then try. Go. Just try to love the immutable.

And then I'm not feeling anything yet. See, God is just a term. God is just, he's an abstraction, frankly.

The word God is just an abstraction. But notice what it says, the secret of the peace of heart of God, or maybe I should say the peace of God keeps your hearts and your minds, not just in God, but in Christ Jesus. And by the way, hearts and minds have separated there grammatically because Paul's trying to say, it's one thing to keep your thoughts in Christ Jesus.

We already talked about this. It's another thing to put your heart in him, to have your heart in Christ Jesus. How does it work?

To find him attractive, to find him lovely, to find him unbelievably lovely. See, it's not enough. It says, Paul says, I want you to find Jesus Christ lovely.

That's the only way you're ever going to love the immutable and find that trend of quality. Well, how do you do that? Think like this.

There's a place, actually, we read this. It was in a passage we looked at earlier this year, but we didn't look at the verse. It's in Isaiah 57.

Remember, when we're going through Isaiah? Isaiah 57, near the, at the end of the chapter says this, the wicked are like the tossing sea, which cannot rest whose waves cast up myron mud. There is no peace, says my God, for the wicked.

The wicked are like the tossing sea, which cannot rest whose waves cast up myron mud. There is no peace, says my God, for the wicked. Now, at first sight, this just looks like another one of these Old Testament statements, God will smite the evil doers, but no, look, this is talking about natural consequences.

And the stomachs had it right, and Augustin had it right. If you love anything more than God, I don't just mean it's important to believe in God, of course, you have to believe in God, but if you love anything more than God, if you live for anything more than God, your life is going to be like a tossing sea, restless, constantly casting up myron mud, because your life is like a house built on sand instead of on the rock, and you're always going to be having cave-ins. We've been through it.

If you love anything, you're going to always be an anxiety about it. Anything more than God. And so God is saying the natural consequence of turning away from me, the natural consequence of not building your whole life, centering your whole life on me, is restlessness, deep restlessness.

Who took those consequences? You know, in 2 Corinthians 521, we always, that I always quote, God made Jesus sin, who knew no sin, that we might become the righteous of God and him, and how I always try to point out that doesn't mean that God made Jesus sinful. It means on the cross he treated him as the sinners deserve.

And what does this mean? On the cross, he got all the consequences of what we have done. And this is one of them.

And can't you see it? Do you see Jesus Christ just walking through the crucifixion saying, I'm just keeping my mind centered on God? I'm okay.

I'm content in whatever circumstance I'm in. Jesus didn't say that. No, because he wasn't.

Why? Because he lost all of his peace. He cries, my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

In fact, we're told that he died with a cry. He died screaming. Bill Lane, the commentator on the book of Mark, says, he says, the cry of dereliction.

That screaming says crucified criminals ordinarily suffered complete exhaustion. And for long periods were unconscious before they died. The stark realism of Mark's account describes a sudden violent death.

The cry of dereliction expresses unfathomable pain. Jesus lost all of his peace. All of his peace.

So you could have eternal peace. And looking at that is what we'll get you through. That's what we'll make him lovely.

And let me prove it to you. We've got a case right in front of you. Horatio Spafford was an American lawyer who lost everything he had in the Chicago Fire of 1871.

Only two years later, he sent his wife Anna and their four daughters on a ship across the Atlantic Ocean to England for a trip. The ship hit another ship on the way and began to sink. As was sinking, Anna got the four little girls together and they prayed.

And then the ship went under the water and they all were scattered into the waves. And all four good little girls drowned. Anna was found unconscious by a rescue ship floating.

They rescued her. They took her to England and she cabled Horatio Spafford just two words, saved alone. And when Horatio Spafford was on the ship over to England to bring his wife home, he began to write a hymn that we're going to sing at the end.

Is well with my soul, peace like a river. He wrote that. And here's what I want you to think.

Why would a man dealing with his grief, seeking the peace of God, the peace like a river, spent the entire thing on Jesus? My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought, my sin, not in part, but the whole, is nailed to the cross. And I bear it no more.

Praise the Lord, praise the Lord on my soul. What is that got to do with his four little girls that are dead? Everything.

You know why? Look, when things go wrong, one of the ways you lose your peace as you say, maybe I'm being punished, but no, look at the cross. All the punishment fell on him.

Another thing you say is, well, maybe God doesn't care, maybe doesn't care. And no, look what he did for us. Look what he bore for us.

The Bible gives you a God that says, I've lost the child too, but not involuntarily, voluntarily for your sake. You sing that hymn and you watch a man thinking, thanking and loving himself into the peace of God. It worked for him under those circumstances.

It worked for Paul under his circumstances. It worked for you. Let's pray.

Thank you, Father, for giving us this offer, peace, like a river, peace and fallible. We see, Lord, that peace is not something that really does just come it's not a talent and it's really not even just a simple gift. It's a discipline.

We have a number of beliefs that we're not thinking into. We have a wonderful God that we're not loving and therefore we don't have the peace we ought to have. Give us this peace because we know the secret how we can be thankful for even the bad things in our lives.

It's the cross. How we can know that God is with us no matter what it's the cross and we pray that you would help us knowing the gospel of Jesus Christ. Think and thank and love you into the peace of God.

It's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Thanks for listening to today's teaching.

就这么去做。然后告诉我，你知道的，写一篇论文告诉我结果如何。也就是说，回家后找一个安静的地方坐下，然后尝试一下。去吧，就试试看。

我现在什么感觉都没有。你看，“上帝”这个词只是一个术语。实际上，上帝只是一个抽象的概念。“上帝”这个词只是个抽象概念。

但请注意保罗所说的，内心的和平之秘在于：上帝的平安会保守你们的心思意念，在基督耶稣里得着平安。顺便说一句，这里“心”和“心思”在语法上是分开的，因为保罗的意思是，不仅要把你的思想集中在基督耶稣身上，还要把你的心放在他身上。这又是怎么运作的呢？就是要找到他吸引人的地方，发现他的美好，发现他的无比的美好。

你看，这还不够。保罗说：“我希望你们能够发现耶稣基督的美好。” 只有这样，你才能真正地去爱那不变的东西，并感受到那种品质。那么，要如何做到这一点呢？

试着这样思考： 有一个地方，我们读到过。其实是在今年年初我们查考的一段经文里，但当时没有看这一节。这段经文在以赛亚书57章。记得我们在查考以赛亚书的时候吗？

以赛亚书57章，接近章节的结尾处说：“恶人如同翻腾的大海，无法平静；其中的水波兴云雾、淤泥翻上。罪孽没有止息，”这是我的神的话，“罪孽没有止息。” 乍一看，这似乎只是旧约中的一种说法：上帝要惩治作恶的人。但不，这里说的是自然的结果。

胃经和奥古斯丁都对了。如果你比爱上帝更爱其他东西——当然，我指的是必须相信上帝这一点是重要的，但是如果你比爱上帝更爱其他东西，如果生活的目标不是上帝，你的生命就会像翻腾的大海，无法平静，不断地涌起淤泥。因为你的生命就像建在沙上而不是磐石上的房子，总是会坍塌。我们已经经历过这些了。

如果你比爱上帝更爱任何事物，你的心中总会有焦虑。任何比上帝更重要的东西。所以上帝说，远离我的自然结果是：不安，深深的不安。谁承担了这些后果呢？

你知道，在哥林多后书5章21节，我总是引用的一节经文里：“神使那无罪的，替我们成为罪，好叫我们在他里面成为神的义。”我一直试图指出，这并不是说上帝让耶稣变得有罪。而是说在十字架上，他承受了我们应该承担的罪孽。这意味着什么？

在十字架上，他承担了我们所做的一切后果。这就是其中之一。你能看出来吗？你看耶稣基督在受难时只是静静地想着神：“我平安无惧。

”“无论处在何种境况中，我都心满意足。”耶稣没有这么说，因为事实并非如此。——以赛亚书57章 哥林多后书5:21 为什么呢？因为他失去了所有的平静。

他哭喊着：“我的神，我的神，你为何离弃我？” 事实上，我们被告知他是带着哭喊声死去的。他死时在尖叫。马克书的注释者比尔·莱恩说，这是弃绝的呼喊。

这尖叫声表明被钉十字架的人通常会经历完全的筋疲力尽，在死亡前会长时间失去意识。马可福音的生动描述揭示了一种突然而剧烈的死亡。弃绝的呼喊表达了无法理解的痛苦。耶稣失去了所有的平静。

他失去了所有的平静。所以你可以拥有永恒的和平，而注视着这一点正是我们将要带给你的礼物。这就是我们让他变得美好的方式。#### 实际案例：霍拉提奥·斯帕福德的见证 让我来证明给你们看。

这里有一个案例摆在你们面前。霍拉提奥·斯帕福德是一位美国律师，在1871年的芝加哥大火中失去了所有财产。仅仅两年后，他让妻子安娜和他的四个女儿乘船前往英格兰旅行。途中船只与另一艘船相撞开始下沉。

在沉没的过程中，安娜把四个小女孩聚在一起并为她们祈祷。然后船沉入水中，四个人都被波浪冲散了，四个好女孩都溺水身亡。安娜被救援船发现时处于昏迷状态。他们救起了她，并把她送到英格兰。

她给霍拉提奥·斯帕福德发了一条电报，只有两个字：“生还者”。当霍拉提奥·斯帕福德乘船前往英格兰接他的妻子回家时，他开始写一首我们将在结尾唱的圣诗。我的灵魂平安，如河水般平静。他写下了这些词。

现在我想让你们思考的是： 为什么一个正在处理丧女之痛、寻求神的和平、如同河水般的和平的人，会把一切都放在耶稣身上？我的罪，哦，这个荣耀想法的快乐，我的罪，不是部分，而是全部，都被钉在了十字架上。我再也不会背负它。赞美主，赞美主在我的灵魂中。

这和他那四个已经死去的小女孩有什么关系？一切都有关系。你知道为什么吗？当事情不顺时，你失去平静的一种方式是说：“也许我在受惩罚。

”但不，你看十字架。所有的惩罚都落在了他身上。另一件你说的是，或许上帝不在乎，或许根本就不在乎。但看看他为我们做了什么，承受了什么。

圣经中的上帝说："我也失去了孩子，但这不是出于不得已，而是自愿为你而做的。"你唱着那首赞美诗，看着一个人在思考、感恩和爱中找到了上帝的平安。在他所处的情况下，这奏效了。这也为保罗在困境中带来了平安。

它也适用于你。### 结束祷告 让我们祷告。感谢你，父亲，赐给我们这份礼物——如河一般的平安，还有那份不完美但真实的平安。主啊，我们看到，和平并不是自然而然就有的，也不是一种天赋或简单的恩赐。

这是一种纪律。我们在许多信念上还没有深入思考。我们拥有一位奇妙的上帝，却没有真正去爱他，因此我们没有应有的平安。求你赐给我们这份平安，因为我们知道如何感恩生活中的每一件事，即使是最糟糕的事情。

这是通过十字架实现的。无论发生什么，我们知道上帝与我们同在，这也是通过十字架。我们祈求你能帮助我们明白耶稣基督的福音。思考、感恩并爱自己进入上帝的平安中。

奉耶稣的名祷告。阿门。感谢你今天聆听我们的教导。愿你们被鼓励，并将这福音应用到生活中，也分享给他人。
