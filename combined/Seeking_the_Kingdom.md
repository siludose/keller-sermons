## 焦虑的本质：渴望掌控不可掌控之事

Welcome to Gospel in Life. What is holding you back from truly trusting in God?

From not just believing in His existence, but letting the power of His Word change how you approach daily life, work, and relationships. In today's message, Tim Keller looks at one of Jesus' most well-known teachings to explain how true faith begins when we stop trying to control our own lives and start trusting in the God who knows exactly what we need. Matthew 6, 25 through 34.

Therefore, I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink. Or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food and the body more important than clothes?

Look at the birds of the air. They do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?

Who of you, by worrying, can add a single hour to His life? And why do you worry about clothes?

See how the lilies of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?

So do not worry, saying, what shall we eat, or what shall we drink, or what shall we wear? For the pagans run after these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness. And all these things will be given to you as well.

Therefore, do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own. This is a Presbyterian church. I heard somebody ready to say, Amen. We're looking at the Sermon on the Mount, and today we come to Jesus' command not to be anxious. Three times He says, don't be anxious. A quick question.

A quick question that comes up. How can somebody, how does anybody have the audacity to command us not to be anxious?

Who wants to be anxious? Nobody gets up in the morning and says, I'm going to really be anxious today. I can't wait. You know, it's not a very voluntary thing.

So why would Jesus command us? If we look carefully, we'll see that He's not commanding us in a kind of drill sergeant way. There's a friend of mine, a pastor.

A pastor friend of mine who was poking fun at himself. He's in his 50s now, but when they first got married, he and his wife, in their early 20s, he was saying that she went into a depression, and he used all of his, every bit of skill he could to get her out of it. He says, I tried everything, everything. Every single morning I went into her and I said, buck up.

But nothing helped. He says, she was incorrigible. Jesus is not coming to us today and saying, buck up. You know, what are you being anxious for?

Cut it out. You know, stop it. Whistle a happy tune. He doesn't do anything like that.

那么，焦虑到底是什么？第一个问题：它究竟是什么？

好问题。描述它其实比定义它更容易。不久前《时代》杂志说，焦虑是"我们现代文化中最普遍的特质"。我认为原因在于，焦虑不仅仅是一个心理现象，它同时具有心理的、生理的和哲学的层面。

从心理层面来看，焦虑当然可以集中在某个具体的危险上，但焦虑也可以是一种弥漫性的、令人瘫痪的状态。这种焦虑并不真正聚焦于任何特定的原因。最好的描述方式是——它就像电影《大白鲨》里那个低沉的主题音乐，贯穿你整个生活："咚……咚……咚……咚……咚……"你四处张望，寻找那个鲨鱼鳍。你确信有什么事情要出问题了。这就是所谓的神经质。

你知道，这是一种可怕的东西，它确实可以笼罩我们整个心理生活。但不止于此——焦虑还有生理层面。从生理上说，焦虑就是压力。我们都知道这一点。我们知道身体有一个自主神经系统，当危险出现时，身体会突然被触发。

这个系统被焦虑、被危险所触发。我们开始分泌肾上腺素，以及各种其他物质，使我们准备好进入所谓的"战斗或逃跑"模式。我们准备好了采取极端行动。

所以当危险出现时，我们的身体有一套机制让自己准备好行动。但如果你发现自己一直生活在压力之下，日复一日，不断面对各种感知到的威胁——财务威胁、职业威胁、人际关系威胁——你会发现你的身体始终处于那种状态。而你的身体本不应该长期如此。那套系统不应该每天都在运转。最终，你真的会被烧尽。你会耗竭。你会崩溃。

溃疡、高血压就是结果。但焦虑甚至还有哲学层面。海德格尔和德国存在主义者谈论"焦虑"（Angst），但他们还谈到了我最喜欢的一个词：Geworfenheit——"被抛性"，一种被抛入世界的感觉。事物毫无因由。当你读到一篇关于去年圣诞节的报道——布朗克斯的一个小男孩，圣诞夜坐在餐桌旁，一颗流弹穿过天花板、穿过地板、穿过墙壁，直接射进房间，击中他的头部，他就那样死在了餐桌旁。当你读到这样的故事——如果你去找，《纽约时报》每天都有——你就开始感受到那种 Geworfenheit，那种比心理层面更深的、属于哲学层面的焦虑：一种感觉，觉得世间万事毫无因由、毫无道理。

焦虑可以如此无处不在。它确实能够渗透到我们生活的每一个层面——身体、灵魂和精神，彼此交织。

但它到底是什么？我认为，当耶稣在经文的最后说"不要为明天忧虑"时，他是在总结之前说过的一切。忧虑是对潜在危险的担心，而不是对实际问题的回应。忧虑是对我们无法掌控之事的执念。焦虑的本质，就是渴望掌控那些我们根本无法掌控的事物。

这就是我们焦虑的原因。我们在一个完全不可能掌控的领域里，却感到自己必须掌控，这就产生了焦虑。

这就是焦虑的本质。焦虑是企图掌控不可掌控之事的意志。

## 焦虑的根源：人类对权力的渴望

Instead, if you look carefully, you'll see that He gets underneath and He explains to us the why. And He reasons with us. There's a sense in which He does surgery. And He says, anxiety is wrong. And if you sit still and let me do my surgery. If I put surgery in you, if you listen to my instructions, I can get it out of you.

I can remove it. So there is an obedience, but at the same time, there's definitely a sense here that Jesus says, I'm going to show you how to get underneath the surface and how you can let me get underneath the surface and deal with anxiety. Three times, don't be anxious, Jesus says.

Now, what's anxiety? First question, what is it?

Good question. It's actually easier to describe than to define. There's a Time magazine not too long ago said it's the most prevailing quality of our modern culture. And I think the reason for that is anxiety is more than a psychological thing. It's got a psychological and a physical and a philosophical aspect.

See, psychologically, anxiety, of course, can either be focused on a specific danger, but anxiety can be a debilitating general condition. Anxiety is a condition that is not really focused on any particular cause. And that is, the best way to describe it, it's like having a constant Jaws theme bass note line going through your life. You know, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump. You're looking around for the fin. You're sure something's going wrong. It's called neurotic.

You know, it's a frightening thing. And it really can characterize our whole life psychologically. But more than that, anxiety. Anxiety also is a physical aspect. Physically, anxiety is called stress. You know, we know this. We know that our bodies have an autonomic nervous system so that when there's a danger, our bodies can suddenly get actually triggered.

That system gets triggered by the anxiety, by the danger. And we begin to pump adrenaline and begin to pump in all kinds of other things that gets us ready for what's called the fight or flight. We're ready for dramatic drasticness.

So when danger appears, our body has a way of getting itself ready to do something. But if you find that you're constantly living with stress, that every day, day in and day out, you're constantly living with perceived dangers, financial dangers and professional dangers and relationship dangers, you find that your body is always in that condition. And your body's not supposed to be like that. The system's not supposed to be going off every day. And eventually, you literally burn up. You burn. You burn out.

And ulcers and hypertension and high blood pressure is the result. But anxiety even has a philosophical aspect. You know, Heidegger and the German existentialists talked about angst, but they also talked about my favorite word, geworfenheit. The thrownness, a feeling of being thrown into the world. No rhyme or reason to things. And when you read an article about last Christmas about a little boy in the Bronx sitting at table on Christmas Eve and a stray bullet just coming, tearing up through the ceiling, up to the floor, tearing up through the wall, tearing right into the room, hitting him in the head and killing him right at the table. And when you read stories like that, and if you look for them, they're in the New York Times every day, you begin to feel that geworfenheit, the anxiety that's even more philosophical than psychological, a sense that there's no rhyme or reason to things.

It can be so prevailing. Anxiety can and does infect every part of our lives. Body, soul, and spirit interlocking.

But what is it? And I think when Jesus says, don't worry about tomorrow, at the very end of the passage, He's summing up everything else He said. Worry is concern about the potential, not the actual. Worry is concern about that which we can't control. Anxiety, the essence of anxiety, is the desire to control that which we can't control.

That's why we're anxious. We feel the need for control in an area where there's no possibility of control. That causes anxiety.

Now, that's what it is. Anxiety is the will to control the uncontrollable. Secondly, if that's what it is, where does it come from?

And the Bible, as usual, gives us a little bit of a clue about what it is. It gives us a little bit of a clue about what it is. It gives us far and away the most coherent answer.

Jesus Christ is, if you look carefully, you'll see that in a very gentle way, He is saying the source of anxiety is the human will to power. The fact is that we want the power that God's got. And anxiety comes from that. He says, for example, He says, who by being anxious can add one minute to your life?

But that's the point. We want to add. We want the power God has. And Jesus is saying, isn't life more than food and drink?

And who by worrying can add one minute to your life? What He's saying is, listen, who's been keeping your life going all these years anyway?

What are you worried about it now for? Put it this way. He says, when the doctor comes in with bad news, when the boss comes in with bad news, suddenly we get anxious because we feel like we're out of control.

But it's the threat that reveals the illusion that we've been living at all this time. Living on all these years, the illusion is we felt up to now that we were in control. We're getting anxious because we feel like we're getting out of control. That's not true. The threat is revealing your true condition. You've always been out of control. You've always been vulnerable.

You've never been keeping your life going. And you see, danger, which triggers anxiety, the anxiety is essentially showing us not a new precarious situation, but at the deepest level, that's where Heidegger comes in with his Gvorfenheit. At the deepest level, it's showing us what we knew all along. We've never been in charge. We're not in control. And Jesus says that we're anxious because we disbelieve and dislike the fact that we're totally dependent on the supporting power of God. We don't like it, and we are afraid of 's what the anxiety is.

Biblically, though, there's a wonderful truth underneath all this. Pascal, the Christian philosopher, has a very interesting statement. The great thing about Christianity is even when it's telling you what's wrong with you, it tells it such a positive way because it shows you where it's from. Pascal puts it like this. He says, not on page 3, but on page 2, he says, the greatness of man is so evident, that it is even proved by his wretchedness. For who is unhappy at not being a king, but a deposed king?

Now, you know what he's saying? The Bible says the reason we're anxious is because we need to be in control. But the reason we want to be in control is we were made originally to be kings and queens on earth.

第二个问题：如果这就是焦虑的本质，那它从何而来？

圣经一如既往地给了我们一些线索，不仅告诉我们焦虑是什么，而且给出了迄今为止最连贯的答案。

耶稣基督——如果你仔细看，你会发现——以一种非常温和的方式在说：焦虑的根源是人类对权力的渴望。事实是，我们想要上帝所拥有的那种权力。焦虑正是由此而来。他举例说："谁能用忧虑使自己的寿数多加一刻呢？"

这正是关键所在。我们想要增添。我们想要上帝所拥有的那种权力。耶稣是在说："生命不胜于饮食吗？"

"谁能用思虑使自己的寿数多加一刻呢？"他的意思是：听着，这些年来，究竟是谁一直在维系着你的生命？

你现在还担心什么呢？换个方式说吧。他说，当医生带来坏消息的时候，当老板带来坏消息的时候，我们突然就焦虑了，因为我们觉得自己失去了掌控。

但那个威胁所揭露的，不过是我们一直以来活在的幻觉罢了。多年来，我们活在一个幻觉里，那就是我们觉得自己一直在掌控之中。我们之所以焦虑，是因为觉得自己正在失去掌控。但事实并非如此。那个威胁不过是揭示了你的真实处境——你从来都不曾在掌控之中。你一直都是脆弱的。

你从来不是靠自己维系生命的。你看，危险触发了焦虑，而焦虑本质上向我们展示的，并不是什么新的危急处境，而是在最深的层面——这就是海德格尔所说的 Geworfenheit 的意义所在——它向我们揭示了我们心底一直知道的事实：我们从来都不是主宰。我们并不在掌控之中。耶稣说，我们之所以焦虑，是因为我们不愿意相信、也不愿意接受这个事实：我们完全依赖于上帝的托举之力。我们不喜欢这个事实，我们害怕它。焦虑就是这么回事。

不过，从圣经的角度看，在这一切之下还有一个美好的真理。帕斯卡，这位基督徒哲学家，有一段非常有意思的话。基督教的伟大之处在于，即使它在告诉你"你哪里出了问题"的时候，也是以一种积极的方式来讲述，因为它向你揭示了问题的来源。帕斯卡是这样说的——不是在第三页，而是在第二页——他说："人的伟大是如此明显，甚至可以从他的悲惨中得到证明。因为谁会因为自己不是国王而感到不快乐呢？只有被废黜的国王。"

你知道他在说什么吗？圣经说，我们焦虑的原因是我们需要掌控。但我们之所以渴望掌控，是因为我们原本被造为地上的君王和王后。

圣经告诉我们，我们被造为管家。管家是大宅中最高级的仆人。管家是拥有权柄的仆人。管家在主人面前是仆人，但在其他所有人面前，他就是王。当管家对主人保持依赖、顺从、爱戴的时候，他的权柄就不断增长。

我们被造就是要成为那样的君王。但圣经在创世记中告诉我们，我们不满足于只是掌管除上帝以外的一切。我们想要掌管一切。我们想要成为自己的主人。当我们试图超越人的本分时，我们反而变得不如人。当我们试图超越自己时，我们反而不如从前的自己。

今天，我们如何回应这种对掌控的需要——这种需要源自我们被造为君王、被造来享有荣耀的事实？我们现在的回应方式和当初亚当夏娃的回应方式完全一样。我们与亚当夏娃毫无二致。我们现在的回应方式就是当初的回应方式。我们试图获取更多的权力和更多的掌控。而我们越是试图获取权力和掌控、越是试图成为自己的主人，我们就越觉得自己无能为力。

因此，尼布尔（Reinhold Niebuhr），那位在协和神学院执教多年的学者，对神学与心理学之间的关系有过一段精辟的论述。他说："那些将权力意志视为人类最主要动机的现代心理学派，至今尚未认识到这种意志与不安全感之间的根本关联。"也就是焦虑。"人的自我感到不安全，因此拼命攫取更多权力来使自己安全。它认为自己不够重要或不够受尊重，于是寻求提升自己的地位。"你听到了吗？

我们因为渴望权力而感到不安全。我们越是渴望权力，越是试图掌控自己的生活，越是怨恨上帝实际上在掌管我们的生活这个事实，我们就越不安全。焦虑来自那种权力意志。

这就是为什么路德有一天看着他的朋友腓力·墨兰顿（Philip Melanchthon），当时墨兰顿正满心忧虑，为各种事务的进展担忧不已。路德没有说"振作起来！"而是做了一个手术。他深入到问题的根源，对腓力说："让腓力不再试图治理世界吧。"你知道你为什么焦虑吗，腓力？因为你想要掌管一切。你在试图掌管一切。

让腓力不再试图治理世界。我们必须自我张扬，而焦虑正是在我们这样做的时候产生的。

## 对症下药：纠正错误的思维

The Bible tells us that we were built to be stewards. Now, a steward was the number one slave in a great mansion. The steward was the slave with authority. A steward was a slave toward the master, but toward everyone else he was a king. And when a steward is a slave toward his master, dependent, loving, obedient, he grows in his authority.

That's the kind of king we were built to be. The Bible tells us, though, in the book of Genesis, that we didn't like being in charge of everything except God. We wanted to be in charge of everything except God. We wanted to be in charge of everything. We wanted to be our own masters. And trying to become more than human, we became less. And trying to become more than ourselves, we became less than ourselves.

And today, how do we respond to this need for control, which comes from the fact we were built to be kings, the fact we were built for glory? We respond now the way we responded then. We're no different than Adam and Eve. We respond now the way we responded then. We try to get more power and more control. And the more we try to get power and control and be our own masters, the less powerful we feel.

And so Reinhold Niebuhr, the man who taught at Union Seminary for years, has a fascinating statement about the relationship of theology to psychology. He says, The schools of modern psychology which regard the will to power as the most dominant of human motives has not yet recognized how, basically, it's related to insecurity. Anxiety. The human ego does not feel secure and therefore grasps for more power in order to make itself secure. It does not regard itself as sufficiently significant or respected and seeks to enhance its position. Did you hear that?

We're insecure because we want power. And the more we want power, the more we seek to control our lives, the more we resent, the more we resent the fact that God's actually in control of our lives, the more insecure we get. Anxiety comes from that will to power.

And that's why Luther looked at Melanchthon, his friend Philip Melanchthon one day, who was worried, full of anxiety about how things were going. And instead of Luther saying, Buck up! He did surgery. He went underneath and said to Philip, he says, Let Philip cease to rule the world. You know why you're anxious, Philip. You want to be in charge. You're trying to be in charge.

Let Philip cease to rule the world. We have to assert ourselves, anxiety comes when we do. What's anxiety?

The need for control of the uncontrollable. Where does it come from?

Our basic, essential nature as kings and queens, which we are trying to express by being masters of our own lives when we're not. Then number three, well, then what do we do about it?

And you say, this is wonderful. This is very interesting. It makes me feel very interested.

But what do I do? And again, Jesus would never just say, Buck up. He tells you what to do. And essentially in this passage, he says, if you're full of anxiety, psychological, physical, philosophical, whatever, there are two things you're doing wrong. And therefore, if you want to remove the anxiety from your life, there's two things you've got to do right. The two things you're doing wrong is wrong thinking and wrong priorities. Wrong thinking and wrong priorities.

Here's what we mean. Number one, wrong thinking. Again and again, he says, in the old King James, he says, consider the birds of the air. Consider the lilies of the field.

Now, in our modern translations of the one that I just wrote, I just read, I didn't write it. I'd be a rich man if I wrote it. It just says, look at. It says, see the birds of the air. It says, look at the grass of the field. That's not nearly as good a word because the word that's used there is a word that means ponder and think.

Jesus says, if you're anxious, you're not thinking. He says, do not be anxious, but consider this, consider that. Now, listen, before I even move on, do you see how critical that is?

What do you think faith is? Do you think faith is an absence of thinking?

焦虑是什么？是对不可掌控之事的掌控欲。它从何而来？来自我们作为君王和王后的本质——我们试图通过做自己生命的主人来表达这种本质，但我们根本做不到。那么第三个问题：我们该怎么办？

你会说："这太精彩了。这非常有意思。让我很受启发。"

但我该怎么做呢？同样，耶稣绝不会简单地说"振作起来"。他告诉你具体该做什么。在这段经文中，他本质上是在说：如果你充满焦虑——无论是心理上的、生理上的，还是哲学上的——你犯了两个错误。因此，如果你想从生活中除去焦虑，你需要做对两件事。你犯的两个错误是：错误的思维和错误的优先次序。错误的思维和错误的优先次序。

我们来看看具体是什么意思。第一，错误的思维。他一次又一次地说——在古老的钦定本中，他说"想想天空的飞鸟"（consider），"想想野地的百合花"（consider）。

在我们现代的译本中，也就是我刚刚读到的——我是说读到的，不是写的。如果是我写的，我早就发财了——它只是说"看看"。它说"看那天空的飞鸟"，"看那野地里的草"。这个翻译不够好，因为原文用的那个词的意思是"深思"和"细想"。

耶稣说，如果你焦虑，那是因为你没有在思考。他说：不要忧虑，而是要仔细思想这个、仔细思想那个。听着，我还没继续往下讲，你就先看看这有多关键。

你以为信心是什么？你以为信心就是不用思考吗？

你以为信心就是闭上眼睛往下跳吗？你以为信心就是说："嗯，这毫无道理，但没关系。信心就是这样的"？耶稣是这样讲的吗？

绝对不是。耶稣说信心就是思考。他说不去思考的恰恰是焦虑。焦虑、恐惧和忧伤——

你看，当你坐在那里，听着你的心在那里信口开河的时候，那才是让你害怕的。当你的心开始胡言乱语，开始对各种状况产生本能反应——它就像你我不经思考就脱口而出那样失控了。

于是你躺在床上，你的心在说："哦，事情会变得多糟糕啊，哦，一切会多可怕啊，我该拿这件事怎么办呢？"你在倾听你的心，而不是对你的心说话。耶稣说，倾听你的心正是焦虑的来源。

相反，你应该坐下来对你的心说："等等，看看事实。想想这个，想想那个。"你和它辩论，你对它讲道理。

信心是什么？朋友们，信心不是让平静的想法飘过你的脑海，信心也不是关闭你的思维。信心是基于上帝在他话语中所说的，对这个世界持有的一种确信的态度。

如果你不相信上帝已经在他的话语中说了话，那么你绝对没有任何办法来处理焦虑，句号。我挑战任何人来告诉我还有其他方法。

但如果你明白上帝已经说了话，那你就拿着他的话语与自己辩论。耶稣给了你两个论证。第一个论证是——到飞鸟那里去看。

耶稣说，去看那飞鸟，就知道上帝在掌权。第一个论证是"天空的飞鸟"的论证。第二个论证是"野地里的草"的论证。你知道怎么使用这两个论证吗？

我不希望任何人离开这里时还不会用。第一个论证是关于上帝护理的论证。第二个是关于上帝之爱的论证。

## 上帝的护理：万事互相效力

Do you think faith is just closing your eyes and jumping? you think faith says, well, it doesn't make any sense, but it doesn't matter. That's where faith comes in. Is that how Jesus talks?

No way. Jesus says faith is thinking. He says it's anxiety that's the absence of thinking. Anxiety and fear and distress.

You see, when you're sitting and listening to your heart run off at the mouth, that's what makes you scared. When your heart starts to ramble, it starts to just react to situations. See, it runs at the mouth the way you do and I do if you don't think before you speak.

So you're laying in bed and the heart's just saying, oh, how bad it's going to be and oh, how awful it's going to be and what am I going to do about this? You're listening to your heart instead of talking to your heart. Listening to your heart is what Jesus says brings the anxiety.

Instead, you sit down with your heart and say, wait, look at the facts. Consider this, consider that. You argue, you talk.

What do you think faith is? Friends, faith is not passing peaceful thoughts through your mind and faith is not turning your mind off. Faith is a position of confidence toward the world based on what God has said in his word.

If you don't believe what God has, if you don't believe God has spoken in his word, there is absolutely no way to deal with anxiety, period. I defy anybody to tell me there is another one.

But if you understand that he's spoken, then you take it and you argue with yourself. And Jesus gives you two arguments. The first argument is, go to Jesus.

Jesus says, go to the bird and see that God is in charge. And the first argument is this birds of the air argument. The second argument is this grass of the field argument. Do you know how to use these two?

I don't want anybody to leave here without knowing how. The first argument is a providence of God argument. And the second one is a love of God.

The first argument, Jesus says, is consider the birds. God is in charge of them. God gives them what they need. You don't have the power to add even one minute to your life. And he's saying, God has all the power. God's in charge. God's sovereign.

God is a God of providence. Do you know how to use that on your heart?

The average New Yorker, providence is the capital of Rhode Island. But the word providence, from which the namers of the capital of Rhode Island, God, the word providence comes from provide, provide-ance. Providence, the doctrine of the providence of God is that everything that happens to you is part of God's plan. That everything you have is part of God's provision. Ephesians 1.11 says, everything is working out according to the counsel of his will. Romans 8.28 says, all things work together for good to them that love God. And Jesus says, there is absolutely no way, no way that you could possibly deal with anxiety unless you believe that.

Well, somebody says, that doesn't make me feel better. I feel then like I'm a puppet. I feel like everything is determined. It doesn't matter what I do. And if you jump to that conclusion, I feel like I'm a puppet. I feel like you have moved away from the biblical doctrine of providence to a pagan notion of fate. They're not the same thing.

Let me give you two perfect examples in the Bible. Acts chapter 2, verse 23. That's the place where Peter is talking to the people of Jerusalem, and he says, every one of you, he says, Christ was delivered by the determinate counsel and foreplan of God, and you have slain him by wicked hands. Did you hear that?

When Jesus Christ died, wasn't that death foreordained? Wasn't it planned?

It says he was delivered by the determinate counsel and foreplan of God, and yet, even though you were destined to kill him, even though it was purposed that you kill him, it was wicked when you killed him. And what God is saying here, what Peter is saying is fairly easy to see in a sense. He is saying, the wickedness of God, the wickedness of God, the wickedness of God, the wickedness of God, the wickedness of your heart, you're responsible for. Your choices you're responsible for.

You see, God doesn't make you wicked, but on the other hand, God works through your choices his perfect plan. That's why Joseph could talk to his brothers who sold him into slavery, and he went down into Egypt, and he was almost put to death, but then he eventually became a powerful man, and he was able to save his family later on from famine. And he looks at his brothers, and he says, you meant it for evil, God meant it for good.

What does that mean? Joseph said, God led you to sell me into slavery. It was part of his plan. It looked terrible, it looked awful, but it was part of his plan, and he intended it for good. Does that mean, therefore, brothers, you didn't do anything wrong?

You couldn't help yourself. It was fated. You couldn't help yourself. Of course not. Joseph didn't mean that, and the brothers knew he didn't mean that. And the brothers wept, they repented, because you see, they were responsible for their choices. They were responsible for their choices.

And yet God worked his counsel out, infallibly. And Jesus says, until you understand that, until you believe that, it's impossible for you to deal with anxiety. Absolutely.

That's the reason why, you know, there's a certain sense in which we can say, in Romans 8, 28, all things work together for good to them that love God. The minute you stop being the center of the universe, the minute you take yourself away from being the center of the universe, is the day you become the center of the universe. For example, some of you have been very helped by this church. It's only been here for seven or eight months. You know why it's here?

It's because that I had some denominational connections, some people in my Presbyterian denomination asked me to come here, gave me the support to come here. Why am I in my denomination?

Because my last year of seminary, a man came from England and taught several courses that convinced me, me that I wanted to go into this particular denomination. Why was he there?

Well, it was a close call. He was English, and back then in the early 70s, it was very hard for somebody to get a visa to come here and take a job. One day, the dean of my seminary was praying on his knees saying, oh, Lord, how are we going to get this professor here?

We need him to teach next semester. And one of the students of the seminary was Mike Ford, who was Gerald Ford's son, who was then president of the United States. Mike Ford came and said, what's the problem?

The dean told him. Mike Ford says, well, I'll talk to somebody. Next thing you know, the professor was here. He got his visa.

Why was Mike Ford the son of the president? Because Nixon resigned. Why did Nixon resign?

Because of Watergate. What was Watergate?

One day, a security guard happened to notice a door that was ajar in the Watergate building. One day. Huh?

What if he had driven to work a different route that day? This church wouldn't be here. Listen. When you take yourself out of the center of the universe, you actually become the center of the universe in this sense. All things work together for good to them that love God. You know what that means?

Do you see? It actually says there's a certain sense in which when you finally give yourself over to God and say, I trust you, you begin to realize that everything that's happening, everything that's happening, even Watergate is happening for me. Everything is happening for me. The minute you finally say, I don't I'm not going to be in the center anymore. I'm not going to demand the explanation. I'm not going to only try to stay in control of my life. I'm going to be willing to say, Lord, you know what's best.

第一个论证，耶稣说的是：想想飞鸟。上帝在掌管它们。上帝给它们所需的一切。你没有能力使自己的寿数多加一刻。他是在说：上帝拥有一切权能。上帝在掌权。上帝是至高主宰。

上帝是护理的上帝。你知道怎样把这个道理应用到你的心上吗？

对普通的纽约人来说，"providence"（普罗维登斯）不过是罗得岛的首府。但"providence"这个词——那些给罗得岛首府命名的人正是从这里取的名——"providence"源自"provide"（供应），就是"供应之工"。上帝护理的教义是说，发生在你身上的每一件事都是上帝计划的一部分。你所拥有的一切都是上帝供应的一部分。

> "我们也在他里面得了基业；这原是那位随己意行、做万事的，照着他旨意所预定的。"
> ——以弗所书 1:11

> "我们晓得万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处，就是按他旨意被召的人。"
> ——罗马书 8:28

耶稣说，除非你相信这一点，否则你绝对不可能处理焦虑。

有人会说："这并不让我感觉好些。那我岂不是成了傀儡？我觉得一切都是命定的，我做什么都无所谓了。"如果你跳到这个结论——"我觉得我像个傀儡"——那你就从圣经的护理教义偏离到了异教的命运观。两者完全不同。

让我在圣经中给你两个完美的例子。使徒行传第二章第23节。那里彼得对耶路撒冷的百姓说：

> "他既按着神的定旨先见被交与人，你们就借着无法之人的手，把他钉在十字架上，杀了。"
> ——使徒行传 2:23

你听到了吗？耶稣基督的死，岂不是预定的吗？岂不是计划好的吗？

经文说他是"按着神的定旨先见被交与人"的。然而，即使你们被命定要杀他，即使这是上帝旨意中的目的，你们杀他的行为仍然是恶的。彼得在这里所说的道理，其实并不难理解。他是在说：你心中的恶，你要为此负责。你的选择，你要为此负责。

你看，上帝并没有使你变恶，但另一方面，上帝透过你的选择成就了他完美的计划。这就是为什么约瑟能够对那些把他卖到埃及为奴的哥哥们说——他到了埃及，差点被处死，但最终成了大人物，后来得以在饥荒中拯救他的家人。他看着他的哥哥们说："你们的意思是要害我，但神的意思原是好的。"

这是什么意思？约瑟说：上帝引导你们把我卖到埃及为奴。这是他计划的一部分。看起来很可怕，看起来很糟糕，但这是他计划的一部分，他的用意是好的。那么，这是否意味着——哥哥们，你们没有做错什么？

你们身不由己？这是命中注定的？你们无法自拔？当然不是。约瑟不是那个意思，哥哥们也知道他不是那个意思。哥哥们哭了，他们悔改了，因为你看，他们要为自己的选择负责。他们要为自己的选择负责。

然而上帝的旨意却分毫不差地实现了。耶稣说，除非你明白这一点，除非你相信这一点，否则你不可能处理焦虑。绝对不可能。

这就是为什么——你知道吗——从某种意义上，我们可以说，在罗马书八章28节：

> "我们晓得万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处，就是按他旨意被召的人。"
> ——罗马书 8:28

当你不再是宇宙的中心、当你把自己从宇宙中心的位置移开的那一刻，就是你真正成为宇宙中心的那一天。比如，你们中有些人在这间教会中受益匪浅。它才成立了七八个月。你知道它为什么在这里吗？

因为我有一些宗派内的关系，我所在的长老会宗派里有些人邀请我来这里，也给了我来这里的支持。我为什么在这个宗派呢？

因为在我神学院的最后一年，有一位从英国来的教授讲了几门课程，使我确信我想要加入这个宗派。他为什么会在那里呢？

嗯，这件事还挺曲折的。他是英国人，在七十年代初，外国人要拿到签证来美国工作是非常困难的。有一天，我所在神学院的院长跪在地上祷告说："主啊，我们怎样才能把这位教授请过来呢？"

"我们下学期需要他来教课。"而神学院的一个学生是迈克·福特（Mike Ford），他是杰拉尔德·福特（Gerald Ford）的儿子——福特当时正是美国总统。迈克·福特过来问："什么问题？"

院长告诉了他。迈克·福特说："好吧，我去找人说说。"紧接着，那位教授就来了。他拿到了签证。

迈克·福特为什么是总统的儿子？因为尼克松辞职了。尼克松为什么辞职？

因为水门事件。水门事件是怎么回事？

有一天，一个保安偶然注意到水门大楼里有一扇门半开着。就那一天。啊？

如果那天他换了一条路开车去上班呢？这间教会就不会存在了。听着——当你把自己从宇宙的中心移开，你实际上就在这个意义上成为了宇宙的中心：万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处。你知道这意味着什么吗？

你看到了吗？这实际上是说，在某种意义上，当你最终把自己交给上帝，说"我信靠你"的时候，你开始意识到所发生的一切——所发生的一切，甚至水门事件，都是为了我而发生的。一切都是为了我而发生的。当你终于说"我不再把自己放在中心了。我不再要求得到解释。我不再只想掌控自己的生活。我愿意说：主啊，你知道什么是最好的。"

在腓立比书第四章，经上说：

> "应当一无挂虑，只要凡事借着祷告、祈求，和感谢，将你们所要的告诉神。"
> ——腓立比书 4:6

这意味着，当你向上帝祈求某件事时，无论他给你什么回应，你都预先为此感恩。你怎么能做到呢？

你说，这意味着你要坚定地相信：他不会给你任何错误的、有害的东西。你知道，我们的父母花了一辈子的时间……当我还是小孩子的时候，我的父母总是在"毁掉我的人生"。他们总是说："别吞那些石头。别把叉子插进电源插座。"你知道吗，这些人简直不懂怎么生活。

他们在毁掉我的人生。直到我长大了才意识到，他们每天都在救我的命。有些人说："如果我真的那样信靠他，如果我把自己交给他，他可能会开始吩咐我做一些我不想做的事。他可能会给我一些我不想要的东西。他可能开始命令我，他可能做一些我不愿意顺服的事情。"当然，他会告诉你一些你不想做的事情。

有一个君王有什么用呢？如果你自己已经足够聪明、足够有能力来处理一切，那还要君王做什么？君王之所以存在，正是因为你还不够聪明、不够有智慧来掌控自己的生活。亚伯拉罕不想放弃以撒。摩西不想去见法老。耶稣不想走上十字架。但他的旨意是智慧的、正确的、美善的。那些顺服他旨意的人，将在未来的十亿年里不断感谢他——感谢他有那样的旨意，感谢他赐下了那样的旨意。

当然，他并不安全。谁说过他是安全的？

但他是良善的。他是王，我告诉你。

## 上帝的慈爱：天父知道你的需要

In Philippians 4, it says, have no anxiety, but in everything with prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, make your requests known to God. That means when you ask God for something, thank him ahead of time for whatever he sends. Well, how can you do that?

You say, it means get a conviction that he would not give you anything that's wrong. That's bad. You know, our parents spent all of our lives. When I was a little kid, my parents always were ruining my life. They were always saying, stop swallowing those rocks. Stop sticking that fork into that electrical outlet. You know, these people didn't know how to live.

They're ruining my life. I was not able to swing until I got older and I realized they were saving my life every day. Some people say, if I really trust him like that, if I give myself to him, he may start to tell me things that I don't want to do. He may start to give me things that I don't want to have. He may start to command me. He may do things I don't want to obey. Of course, he'll tell you things you don't want to do.

What's the use in having a king? If you're wise and smart enough to do it yourself, but you have a king and a king is there because you're not wise and smart enough to know how to control your own life. Abraham didn't want to give up Isaac. Moses didn't want to go to Pharaoh. Jesus didn't want to go to the cross, but his will is wise and right and good. And the people who submit to it will spend the next billion years thanking him. That he had it, that he gave it to them.

Of course, he's not safe. Who said anything about him being safe?

But he's good. He's the king, I tell you. The other little thing that you've got to do is use the grass of the field. The grass of the field argument is different. The one argument is to say, he's in control. Who else could I trust but him?

---

你需要做的另一件事，就是使用"野地里的草"的论证。"野地里的草"的论证是不同的。第一个论证是说：他在掌权。除了他，我还能信靠谁呢？

而另一个论证是关于上帝之爱的论证。上帝之爱的论证。耶稣说："你们的父知道你们需要什么。"

这就是你需要抓住你的心、开始把上帝的爱辩论进去的地方。你这样对自己说："听着，我的心啊，你知道他爱你超过你所能想象的。你知道他数过你头上的每一根头发，也数过你脸上流下的每一滴眼泪。你知道这一点。你知道，他既然不爱惜自己的儿子，他怎么可能不把我们所需要的一切都白白赐给我们呢？"

你和自己辩论，然后你开始意识到——焦虑本质上就是每天发给上帝的一份传真，上面写着："我不认为你真的把我的最大利益放在心上。"焦虑就是在说："天父啊，你倾倒了天上最大的宝藏，你心甘情愿地为我处死了你的儿子——但我不确定你是否知道怎样安排我的一周。"当你意识到自己在说什么的时候，你就会明白你在冒犯他的爱。

没有人会容忍这种事。你不会容忍一个孩子这样对你。你不会容忍一个朋友这样对你。你不会容忍任何一个人不断践踏你的爱，就像你对上帝所做的那样。你要和你的心辩论：他是我的父。他知道我需要什么。

## 正确的优先次序：先求他的国

But the other little argument is the love of God argument. The love of God argument. Jesus says, your father knows what you need.

That's where you get your heart and you start to argue God's love into the heart. You go like this. You say, listen, heart. You know that he loves you more than you imagine. You know that he knows all the hairs on your head and how many tears have come down your cheeks. You know that. You know that if he didn't spare his own son, how is he going to fail to give us anything else that we need?

You argue with yourself and you begin to realize anxiety is essentially a daily fax to God saying, I don't think you have my best interests in mind. Anxiety is this. Anxiety is essentially saying, father, you emptied heaven of your greatest treasure and you executed your son voluntarily for me and I'm not sure you're going to know how to arrange my week. And when you realize what you're saying, you begin to realize you are offending his love.

There's no way you would possibly put up with somebody. You wouldn't put up with a kid. You wouldn't put up with a friend. You wouldn't put up with a man who continually trampled on your love the way you do. You argue with your heart. He's my father. He knows what I need.

Now, and then the other thing is wrong priorities. Wrong thinking and wrong priorities. And the wrong priorities are pretty simple. Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be added unto you. You know what that means?

Martha and Mary. You remember Martha and Mary?

Jesus came to their house and Martha ran around the house and she said, I'm going to run around. And literally it says she was anxious, doing many, many things. Uses the same word anxious that Jesus uses here in Matthew 6. Mary sat at Jesus' feet and Jesus comes to Martha and says, Martha, you're anxious and troubled about many, many, many things. One thing is necessary. Mary's found it. Sit down and focus on me.

And what Jesus is saying is worry is always a lack of proportion. If Jesus is in the center, there will be no anxiety. If your profession, if your relationship, if your material comfort, if money, if anything else is in the center, if anything else is more important than Christ, you're going to be torn up with anxiety. Your fears are like the breadcrumbs. Follow them and you'll find the house of the witch. Your anxieties come from that lack of proportion, from that lack of sense of proportion. And Jesus says, put me first.

Seek first my kingdom and righteousness. That means your prayer life. It means your fellowship with other Christians. It means your mission and ministry. It means your growth and grace. If that comes first, Jesus says, I can guarantee you your other concerns will go because you'll be able to think more about me and trust me. Queen Elizabeth once told a man, not the second Queen Elizabeth, the first Queen Elizabeth, told a man that she wanted him to go on a voyage to the new world because we needed his skills on this voyage to make it a success.

And the man looked at her and said, hey, I'm a small businessman and my business has been floundering. And if I go on it, I'm sure it's going to sink. And she looked at him. She says, my dear friend, you mind my business and I'll mind your business. And immediately all the fear left him because, hey, here's the Queen Elizabeth, a monarch of absolute power and wealth. If I mind her business, she'll mind my business. What a deal.

然后另一件事就是错误的优先次序。错误的思维和错误的优先次序。错误的优先次序其实很简单。"你们要先求他的国和他的义，这些东西都要加给你们了。"你知道这意味着什么吗？

马大和马利亚。你们还记得马大和马利亚吗？

耶稣来到她们家，马大在屋子里忙前忙后，她说："我要做这做那。"经文字面意思说她为许多事情忧虑。用的"忧虑"和耶稣在马太福音第六章用的是同一个词。马利亚坐在耶稣脚前。耶稣走到马大面前说："马大，马大，你为许许多多的事忧虑烦扰。但不可少的只有一件。马利亚已经选择了那上好的。坐下来，专注于我。"

耶稣在说的是：忧虑总是一种比例失调。如果耶稣在中心，就不会有焦虑。如果你的职业、你的人际关系、你的物质享受、金钱、或任何其他东西在中心——如果任何东西比基督更重要——你就会被焦虑撕裂。你的恐惧就像面包屑。跟着它们走，你就会找到女巫的房子。你的焦虑来自那种比例失调、那种缺乏正确优先次序的感觉。耶稣说：把我放在首位。

先求我的国和我的义。这意味着你的祷告生活，意味着你与其他基督徒的团契，意味着你的使命和事工，意味着你在恩典中的成长。如果这些放在首位，耶稣说，我可以向你保证，你对其他事情的忧虑就会消退，因为你会更多地思想我、更多地信靠我。伊丽莎白女王有一次对一个人说——不是伊丽莎白二世，而是伊丽莎白一世——她告诉一个人，她需要他参加一次前往新大陆的航行，因为航行的成功需要他的技能。

那个人看着她说："女王陛下，我是一个小生意人，我的生意一直在走下坡路。如果我走了，我的生意肯定就要垮了。"她看着他说："亲爱的朋友，你管好我的事，我来管好你的事。"立刻，所有的恐惧都离开了他，因为——嘿，这可是伊丽莎白女王，一位拥有绝对权力和财富的君主啊。如果我管好她的事，她来管好我的事，这可太划算了。

"你们要先求他的国和他的义，这些东西都要加给你们了。"道理是一样的。完全一样的交换。正确的思维，正确的优先次序；错误的思维，错误的优先次序。

## 信靠基督：不仅信他存在，更要信他的话

Seek first. The kingdom of God and his righteousness and all other things will be added to you. It's the same. It's the same deal. Right thinking, right priorities, wrong thinking, wrong priorities. Listen, two kinds of people here today.

There's some of you who have certainly believed in Jesus Christ, received him as Savior. It's one thing to put faith in him and enter the kingdom. It's another thing to walk by faith.

I can remember years ago talking to a guy and I said, we were counseling together and I said, do you trust in Jesus Christ to save you? Do you believe your sins are covered?

Do you believe in that? And he says, yes, yes, I certainly believe in that. I certainly trust him.

And then I said, do you trust him enough to obey what he says in his word about not marrying someone who's not a believer? Do you trust him enough to obey what he says and to wait for a spiritually mature person to marry?

Silence. Because you see, it's a one thing to believe in him. It's another thing to believe him. It's another thing to, it's one thing to believe in God. Lots of you believe in God, but do you believe God?

And Jesus is saying, trust me, not just believe in me, trust me, listen to what I say, obey me, seek first his kingdom and his righteousness. And there's some of you that possibly are here saying, you know, I know I've never really put my faith in Christ the saying. I've never received him as savior. I've never put him in the center. And some of you are saying, I, I would like to, but I've never been able to believe. I, I wish I could believe, but I have never been able to believe. Listen, there's only two doctrines on which to base your life.

Only two. Either you are competent to run your own life or God is. And your problem when you say, I can't believe, it's not really fair to put it that way. Your real problem is, you refuse to doubt yourself. You think you're competent to run your own life. You're afraid to give your life to Christ. You think you're competent to run your own life.

That is an act of absolutely blind faith. There's no evidence for it. And you know it. It's a leap against the evidence. You refuse to doubt yourself.

That's why you can't believe. Don't tell me that you can't believe in God. What you mean is I refuse to doubt myself, even though I've got every bit of evidence.

I don't care how successful you are. Even the most successful people are making a total mess of some parts of their lives. Come to him. Jesus Christ knew what it was to trust God. In the wilderness, the devil came and said, turn these stones into bread. And he didn't do it. Why?

He continued to depend on God. He wouldn't take matters into his own hands. He wouldn't decide to disobey God, get in control. And because he was faithful, he died as a substitute. And he took the punishment that we deserve. For our will to power.

听着，今天在场的有两种人。

你们中有些人确实已经信了耶稣基督，接受了他作为救主。信靠他、进入他的国是一回事，凭信心行走是另一回事。

我记得多年前和一个人交谈，我们在一起做辅导。我问他："你是否信靠耶稣基督来拯救你？你是否相信你的罪已被遮盖？"

"你相信吗？"他说："是的，是的，我当然相信。我当然信靠他。"

然后我说："你是否足够信靠他，以至于愿意顺服他在圣经中所说的话——不要与不信的人结婚？你是否足够信靠他，以至于愿意顺服他的话，等候一个灵性成熟的人来结婚？"

沉默。因为你看，相信他是一回事，信他说的话是另一回事。相信上帝存在是一回事——你们很多人相信上帝存在——但你信上帝吗？

耶稣在说：信靠我。不仅仅是相信我的存在，而是信靠我，听我的话，顺服我。先求他的国和他的义。还有一些人可能在这里心想："你知道，我知道我从来没有真正把信心放在基督身上。我从来没有接受他作为救主。我从来没有让他居于中心。"也有一些人在说："我想要信，但我一直无法相信。我希望我能信，但我就是信不了。"听着，你的人生只能建立在两种信条中的一种之上。

只有两种。要么你有能力掌管自己的人生，要么上帝有。当你说"我无法相信"的时候，这样说其实并不公平。你真正的问题是，你拒绝怀疑自己。你认为自己有能力掌管自己的人生。你害怕把生命交给基督。你认为自己有能力掌管自己的人生。

那是一种完全盲目的信心。没有任何证据支持它。你自己也知道。那是一个违背证据的跳跃。你拒绝怀疑自己。

这就是你无法相信的原因。不要告诉我你无法相信上帝。你真正的意思是：我拒绝怀疑自己，尽管所有的证据都摆在面前。

我不在乎你有多成功。即使是最成功的人，也在把自己生活的某些方面搞得一团糟。来到他面前吧。耶稣基督知道信靠上帝意味着什么。在旷野，魔鬼来对他说："把这些石头变成饼。"他没有这样做。为什么？

因为他继续依靠上帝。他不愿把事情揽在自己手里。他不愿为了掌控而选择悖逆上帝。正因为他的忠信，他以替代者的身份死了。他承担了我们应受的惩罚——为了我们那对权力的渴望。

这意味着今天，你可以来到他面前，知道如果你不仅相信他的存在，而且相信他说的话，他就是你的替代者。你的罪被涂抹干净。你把自己放在一位父亲的手中——一位知道你需要什么的父亲。

> "耶和华的名是坚固台；义人奔入便得安稳。"
> ——箴言 18:10

## 结束祷告

And that means today, you can go to him and know that if you believe not just in him, but believe him, he's your substitute. Your sins are wiped away. And you put yourself in the hands of a father who knows what you need. The name of the Lord is a strong tower. Run into it and you're safe.

Let's pray. Now we ask, Father, that you will enable us to, by faith, to believe. We commit ourselves to you. Meet us at your table, we pray in Jesus' name. Amen.

---

让我们祷告。我们现在祈求，天父，求你使我们能够凭信心来相信。我们把自己交托给你。求你在你的圣桌前与我们相遇。我们奉耶稣的名祷告。阿们。
